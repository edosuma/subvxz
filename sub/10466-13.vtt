IT'S NOT
JUST A RASH, OK?

18:29.978 --> 18:32.023
IT'S NOT
JUST A RASH.

18:32.023 --> 18:34.461
I MEAN...

18:34.461 --> 18:37.072
WHAT DID I EXPECT,
ANYWAY?

18:37.072 --> 18:39.205
LIKE HERBS
CAN CURE ANYTHING.
WHAT ARE THEY?

18:39.205 --> 18:41.120
NOTHING. POWDER.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.426
YOU KNOW,
AS LONG AS WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT IT,

18:43.426 --> 18:44.819
WHAT'S RADIATION?

18:44.819 --> 18:45.907
LIGHT.

18:45.907 --> 18:48.344
WHAT THE HELL
IS THAT?

18:48.344 --> 18:49.954
WHAT IF
IT'S ALL VOODOO?

18:49.954 --> 18:52.261
WHAT IF
NONE OF IT WORKS?

18:52.261 --> 18:55.134
THAT'D REALLY
BE SOMETHING, HUH?

19:06.145 --> 19:07.624
JULIA.

19:07.624 --> 19:09.278
OH. UM...I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.758
I USED MY KEY.

19:10.758 --> 19:12.281
OH. NO, NO.

19:12.281 --> 19:13.717
DEFINITELY NOT.

19:13.717 --> 19:15.763
THE TEMP AGENCY
DIDN'T HAVE ANY WORK
FOR ME TODAY,

19:15.763 --> 19:18.766
SO I THOUGHT
I'D, YOU KNOW,
HELP OUT HERE WITH THE...

19:18.766 --> 19:20.420
BOOKS OR SOMETHING.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.378
THEN I, UH...

19:22.378 --> 19:25.120
STARTED PAYING
THE BILLS,

19:25.120 --> 19:27.340
BUT...

19:27.340 --> 19:29.516
THERE'S NOT A LOT
OF MONEY HERE.

19:29.516 --> 19:31.387
UH, YEAH. UM...

19:31.387 --> 19:33.650
DON'T--DON'T WORRY,
BECAUSE...

19:33.650 --> 19:35.609
LAST NIGHT,
I WORKED IT
ALL OUT. LOOK.

19:35.609 --> 19:38.002
THE MONEY THAT I'M
HOLDING FOR HOWIE,

19:38.002 --> 19:39.917
IT'S MAKING, LIKE,
5% INTEREST, RIGHT?

19:39.917 --> 19:41.919
UH-HUH.
SO IF I TAKE THAT
OUT OF THE BANK--

19:41.919 --> 19:43.921
HOWIE'S MONEY?
YEAH. JUST FOR
A COUPLE OF DAYS.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.401
I CAN PAY OFF
MY COMPUTER

19:45.401 --> 19:46.663
AND TAKE CARE OF
ALL THESE JOBS.

19:46.663 --> 19:48.491
GRIFFIN--
I'LL HAVE THE MONEY
BACK IN THE BANK

19:48.491 --> 19:49.710
BEFORE HOWIE EVEN
KNOWS IT'S GONE.

19:49.710 --> 19:51.668
AND WHAT IF YOU CAN'T?

19:51.668 --> 19:53.888
SEE, I'VE GOT,
LIKE, 10 JOB ORDERS
LINED UP.

19:53.888 --> 19:56.064
IT--IT'S NOT
YOUR MONEY, GRIFFIN.

19:56.064 --> 19:58.980
GOD, IT'S HOWIE'S,
AND YOU DON'T EVEN
KNOW WHERE HE GOT IT.

19:58.980 --> 20:00.938
YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHAT KIND OF BUSINESS
HE'S IN.

20:00.938 --> 20:02.026
I TOLD YOU,
I'LL PAY IT BACK.

20:02.026 --> 20:03.463
HE WON'T EVEN KNOW
IT'S GONE.

20:03.463 --> 20:06.248
AND WHAT IF HE DOES?
HAVE YOU THOUGHT
ABOUT THAT?

20:06.248 --> 20:08.990
HE BEAT YOU UP ON
YOUR WEDDING DAY.
WHAT IS HE GONNA DO NEXT?

20:08.990 --> 20:10.165
I CAN HANDLE THIS.

20:10.165 --> 20:11.993
OBVIOUSLY YOU CAN'T!

20:11.993 --> 20:14.125
THERE IS, LIKE,
NO MONEY HERE!

20:14.125 --> 20:16.084
YOU'RE NOT SLEEPING,
AND YOU'RE BARELY EATING.

20:16.084 --> 20:18.042
AND NOW YOU'RE COMING UP
WITH SCHEMES TO STEAL
STOLEN MONEY?

20:18.042 --> 20:19.870
IT'S NOT A SCHEME!
IT'S A PLAN!

20:19.870 --> 20:20.915
A BAD PLAN,

20:20.915 --> 20:23.047
A PLAN THAT'S GONNA
MAKE THINGS WORSE.

20:23.047 --> 20:24.397
THAT'S
YOUR DAMN OPINION,
JULIA.

20:24.397 --> 20:26.312
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
I DON'T NEED IT.

20:26.312 --> 20:28.009
YOU KNOW,
Y-YOU'RE MY WIFE.

20:28.009 --> 20:29.619
YOU'RE SUPPOSED
TO SUPPORT ME.
IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT,

20:29.619 --> 20:33.232
THEN DO ME A FAVOR.
STAY HOME!

20:33.232 --> 20:34.929
ALL RIGHT?
DID YOU HEAR ME?
JUST GO HOME.

20:54.992 --> 20:55.993
HEY.

20:57.604 --> 20:58.909
WHOA!

20:58.909 --> 21:01.651
TOO BAD I GOT
TO GET TO WORK.
YOU LOOK GREAT.

21:01.651 --> 21:03.827
A LOT OF GOOD IT DID ME.
HE WOULDN'T EVEN SEE ME.

21:03.827 --> 21:05.089
WHO?

21:05.089 --> 21:07.222
THE GUY FROM
THE INSURANCE COMPANY.

21:07.222 --> 21:09.746
I MEAN, I GOT
ALL DRESSED UP AND WENT
ALL THE WAY DOWNTOWN,

21:09.746 --> 21:11.052
AND THEN
THE RECEPTIONIST...

21:11.052 --> 21:12.488
THE RECEPTIONIST--

21:12.488 --> 21:14.534
SAYS TO ME,
"I'M SORRY, MISS MOTT,

21:14.534 --> 21:15.926
BUT THE POSITION'S
BEEN FILLED."

21:15.926 --> 21:17.232
WAIT A MINUTE...

21:17.232 --> 21:18.929
YOU HAD
A JOB INTERVIEW?

21:18.929 --> 21:21.584
I MEAN, SO WHAT
IF I RESCHEDULED IT
FOR A FEW HOURS?

21:21.584 --> 21:23.499
I MEAN, HE COULD'VE
AT LEAST WAITED--

21:23.499 --> 21:25.588
HOLD ON.
YOU RESCHEDULED
AN INTERVIEW?

21:25.588 --> 21:27.242
THIS MORNING.
I TOLD YOU THAT.

21:27.242 --> 21:28.809
WHEN YOU WANTED
TO STAY IN BED,

21:28.809 --> 21:31.072
I TOLD YOU THAT
I HAD THINGS TO DO.

21:31.072 --> 21:32.073
"THINGS."

21:32.073 --> 21:33.466
"THINGS" ARE LIKE...

21:33.466 --> 21:34.510
SHOPPING...

21:34.510 --> 21:35.903
OR GETTING
YOUR CAR WASHED.

21:35.903 --> 21:37.557
"THINGS" ARE
NOT JOB INTERVIEWS.

21:37.557 --> 21:40.037
I CALLED
AND I CHANGED IT
FROM 10:00 TO 4:00.

21:40.037 --> 21:41.387
I MEAN,
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?

21:41.387 --> 21:43.954
THE BIG DEAL...
IS THAT AT 10:00
THERE WAS A JOB,

21:43.954 --> 21:45.216
AND AT 4:00
THERE WASN'T.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.522
WELL, HOW WAS I
SUPPOSED TO KNOW THAT?

21:46.522 --> 21:48.132
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

21:48.132 --> 21:50.047
YOU NEED A JOB,
YOU DON'T RESCHEDULE
AN INTERVIEW.

21:50.047 --> 21:51.658
YEAH, BUT I DID
THIS FOR YOU!

21:51.658 --> 21:53.050
WELL, DON'T.

21:53.050 --> 21:54.225
DON'T DO THAT.

21:54.225 --> 21:56.358
YOU SHOULDN'T DO
STUFF LIKE THAT
FOR ME.

21:56.358 --> 21:58.404
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE IMPOSSIBLE.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.014
ONE SECOND,
YOU'RE SAYING

22:00.014 --> 22:01.232
WE'RE NEVER
ALONE TOGETHER,

22:01.232 --> 22:03.757
SO I, LIKE, TWIST MYSELF
INTO A PRETZEL

22:03.757 --> 22:06.673
TRYING TO FIND SOME TIME
FOR US TO BE ALONE,

22:06.673 --> 22:08.065
BUT THAT'S WRONG, TOO.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.806
YOU KNOW,
I CAN'T WIN WITH YOU.

22:26.040 --> 22:28.912
THAT WAS REALLY NICE,
WHAT YOU DID FOR ME.

22:28.912 --> 22:31.306
I MEAN, STICKING UP
FOR ME LIKE THAT.

22:31.306 --> 22:33.134
NO ONE EVER DOES THAT.

22:33.134 --> 22:35.049
IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

22:35.049 --> 22:37.617
WELL, MAYBE FOR YOU, BUT...

22:37.617 --> 22:39.662
TO ME, IT...

22:39.662 --> 22:40.881
MEANT A LOT.

22:42.535 --> 22:43.927
LOOK, SALINGER--

22:43.927 --> 22:45.668
I LOVE WHEN YOU
CALL ME THAT.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.241
I READ YOUR LETTER.

22:53.241 --> 22:54.503

22:54.503 --> 22:56.810
GOOD. I MEAN,
I WROTE IT TO YOU.

22:56.810 --> 22:58.202
LISTEN. SOMEHOW--

22:58.202 --> 23:00.074
AND I DON'T
KNOW HOW, BUT--

23:00.074 --> 23:03.164
YOU'VE GOT, LIKE,
THE WRONG IDEA.

23:03.164 --> 23:04.557
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

23:06.689 --> 23:09.300
BUT I THOUGHT...

23:09.300 --> 23:11.955
WELL, I MEAN,
I THOUGHT YOU SAID
THAT YOU FORGAVE ME.

23:11.955 --> 23:13.609
I DID.

23:13.609 --> 23:16.351
THAT STILL
DOESN'T MEAN...

23:16.351 --> 23:18.179
I'M NOT
YOUR BOYFRIEND,
CLAUDIA.

23:18.179 --> 23:20.790
I TOLD YOU THAT
BEFORE.

23:20.790 --> 23:21.965
I MEAN...
I LIKE YOU A LOT,

23:21.965 --> 23:23.402
AND WE'RE FRIENDS--

23:23.402 --> 23:26.666

THINKING ABOUT IT
IN THE RIGHT WAY.

23:33.107 --> 23:34.935

23:34.935 --> 23:37.154

OF HER AS A GOVERNESS

FOR, LIKE CHAPTERS...

23:42.203 --> 23:45.380
AND SHE TURNED OUT TO BE
THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE.

23:45.380 --> 23:47.338
CLAUDIA,
THAT'S A NOVEL.

23:47.338 --> 23:48.427
IT'S FICTION.

23:53.301 --> 23:54.955
DID YOU REALLY
ASK THAT GIRL

23:54.955 --> 23:56.826
TO TRADE LOCKERS
WITH YOU?

23:59.133 --> 24:00.482

25:22.085 --> 25:23.957
OK. I'LL BE THERE.

26:33.026 --> 26:36.769

28:24.485 --> 28:26.530
DOES IT JUST CURE MICE?

42:16.751 --> 42:18.971
YOU NEVER KNOW.

42:22.235 --> 42:25.064
CHARLIE...

42:26.195 --> 42:27.675
YEAH?

42:29.198 --> 42:30.809
IT'S HELPING.

42:42.342 --> 42:44.387
[TAKES DEEP BREATH]

42:49.915 --> 42:51.917
DOES SHE KNOW I'M HERE?

42:51.917 --> 42:53.788
I'M SURE
SHE CAN HEAR YOU.

42:55.311 --> 42:57.749
AND SHE'S STAYING
IN HER ROOM.

42:59.185 --> 43:01.013
WOW.

43:03.929 --> 43:05.887
SHE'LL ADJUST, BAILEY.

43:05.887 --> 43:07.802
I'M SURE OF IT.

43:09.717 --> 43:11.937
IT'S JUST...

43:11.937 --> 43:14.026
GONNA TAKE SOME TIME.

43:16.376 --> 43:17.638
OK.

43:18.987 --> 43:21.120
THEN WE GIVE HER TIME.

43:36.309 --> 43:37.963
PRETTY AMAZING, ISN'T IT?

43:37.963 --> 43:41.183
WE DID ALL THIS
TO SPEND MORE TIME TOGETHER,

43:41.183 --> 43:42.576
AND NOW...

43:42.576 --> 43:45.100
RIGHT.

43:45.100 --> 43:47.363
WELL, MAYBE I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE MEETING
IN THE MORNING.

43:47.363 --> 43:50.453
I CAN'T GO
TILL THE AFTERNOON.

43:50.453 --> 43:53.065
BUT MAYBE I'LL STOP BY
THE RESTAURANT.

43:53.065 --> 43:54.501
IT'S GONNA BE CRAZY
THERE.

43:54.501 --> 43:57.199
BUT IF I GET A BREAK
DURING THE DAY,
I'LL GIVE YOU A CALL.

43:57.199 --> 43:58.331
OK.

43:58.331 --> 43:59.811
OK.

44:04.424 --> 44:05.991
Annie: GOOD NIGHT.

44:11.083 --> 44:11.953
Bailey: GOOD NIGHT.
