39:43.280 --> 39:44.482
harder and harder.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.217
- It comes down
to the smallest things,

39:46.283 --> 39:49.120
but I feel like those technical
things are what it is.

39:49.186 --> 39:51.589
- I appreciate you guys.
I'm taking everything in.

39:51.655 --> 39:53.591
I've listened,
so maybe next time.

39:53.657 --> 39:54.825
- Janelle, you're bad-ass.

39:54.892 --> 39:57.361
- Please pack your
machines and close shop.

39:58.362 --> 39:59.396
- Good job.

40:01.999 --> 40:03.868
- Congratulations,
Nikki, that means that you'll

40:03.934 --> 40:06.537
move on to compete in the
Clash of the Coaches face-off

40:06.604 --> 40:09.840
at the finale for $25,000.

40:09.907 --> 40:10.975
{\an1}- Finally get
to go to the finale.

40:11.041 --> 40:12.576
- Congratulations.
- I'm so excited.

40:12.643 --> 40:15.412
- Josh, thanks for being here.
- Absolutely. It's a pleasure.

40:15.479 --> 40:17.148
I'll come back any time you
guys give me the chance, dude.

40:17.214 --> 40:19.116
- Right on.

40:19.183 --> 40:20.551
<i>- This competition has</i>
<i>opened my eyes</i>

40:20.618 --> 40:22.820
that each day
is a learning experience.

40:22.887 --> 40:25.289
<i>Before she passed,</i>
<i>my mom gave me</i>

40:25.356 --> 40:28.092
<i>all the tools that I</i>
<i>needed to go further in life.</i>

40:28.159 --> 40:31.328
She fought to live
just one more second.

40:31.395 --> 40:34.031
To give up is the worst
thing that you can do.

40:34.098 --> 40:37.134
So, I'm gonna fight for it.
I'm not done yet.

40:44.875 --> 40:48.078
<i>announcer: On the next</i>
<i>episode of "Ink Master"...</i>

40:48.145 --> 40:52.249
- We have taken down
three girls in a row.

40:52.316 --> 40:53.551
Pew, pew, pew!

40:53.617 --> 40:55.019
<i>- We have our</i>
<i>final three right here.</i>

40:55.085 --> 40:57.054
<i>If there was ever</i>
<i>a time to fight, it's now.</i>

40:57.121 --> 40:58.989
We can [bleep] do this.
- Y'all are [bleep].

40:59.056 --> 41:01.625
- I'm gonna stop being nice.
Cam should be petrified.

41:01.692 --> 41:03.727
- We good?
- I don't want to talk.

41:03.794 --> 41:06.063
- Okay.
[indistinct]

41:06.130 --> 41:07.131
{\an1}- Today's gonna
be a heartbreaker.

41:07.198 --> 41:08.599
- Yeah.

41:08.666 --> 41:10.968
- This late in the competition,
this is not enough.

41:11.035 --> 41:12.303
- The person that wins,

41:12.369 --> 41:13.871
it won't be the person
that just does one thing.
