01:05.848 --> 01:09.852
Typical of Victor Von Doom to build
a 30-foot statue of himself.

01:09.936 --> 01:12.438
Well, it's obviously aimed
at first-time visitors...

01:12.521 --> 01:15.858
to create feelings
of smallness, inadequacy.

01:17.193 --> 01:19.028
Good thing it ain't working.

01:19.695 --> 01:23.616
Reed, what are we doing here?
This guy's fast-food, strip-mall science.

01:23.741 --> 01:25.993
This wasn't our first stop,
in case you forgot.

01:26.077 --> 01:30.373
Besides, Victor's not that bad.
He's just a little larger than life.

01:38.756 --> 01:42.885
My research suggests that exposure
to a high-energy cosmic storm...

01:42.969 --> 01:47.556
borne on solar winds might have triggered
the evolution of early planetary life.

01:48.349 --> 01:53.062
In six weeks, another cloud
with the same elemental profile...

01:53.145 --> 01:54.939
will pass Earth's orbit.

01:55.940 --> 01:59.902
A study conducted in space could
fundamentally advance our knowledge...

01:59.986 --> 02:03.322
about the structure of the human genome,
cure countless diseases...

02:03.406 --> 02:07.660
extend human life, give kids a chance
to live longer, stronger, healthier...

02:07.743 --> 02:09.829
Turn it off, please.

02:10.121 --> 02:12.290
I don't think I have explained
my proposal fully.

02:12.373 --> 02:14.125
No, I think you have.

02:14.250 --> 02:16.836
Same old Reed, always stretching,
reaching for the stars...

02:16.919 --> 02:19.380
with the weight of the world on his back.

02:19.463 --> 02:21.632
But dreams don't pay the bills, do they?

02:23.801 --> 02:27.888
You remember, when we were in school
we talked about working together.

02:27.972 --> 02:30.433
Well, that's what I was about to explain.

02:31.934 --> 02:33.185
The storm is deadly.

02:33.269 --> 02:35.313
But the shields on
your station's control room...

02:35.396 --> 02:37.982
are designed to protect
any occupants inside.

02:40.985 --> 02:43.321
So it's not just my money you want.

02:43.863 --> 02:45.072
It's my toys.

02:46.490 --> 02:49.535
Tell me, if NASA doesn't trust you,
then why should I?

02:53.289 --> 02:56.000
That's my job, to stay a step ahead.

02:56.584 --> 02:59.962
To know what other men don't.

03:00.046 --> 03:01.505
I can't take this.

03:01.589 --> 03:03.674
Ben, this is business, just work.

03:03.758 --> 03:06.260
He's right, Ben. It is just business.

03:07.386 --> 03:11.432
I think you both know my Director
of Genetic Research, Susan Storm.

03:15.353 --> 03:17.021
One more thing he's got.

03:17.521 --> 03:19.482
- Hey, Susie.
- Hey.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.985
It's so nice to see you. How's Debbie?

03:23.069 --> 03:24.528
- Great.
- Great.

03:26.989 --> 03:29.158
- How have you been?
- Never better.

03:31.661 --> 03:33.663
This isn't going to be a problem, is it?

03:33.746 --> 03:34.997
- No.
- Not at all.

03:35.081 --> 03:36.290
Good.

03:36.666 --> 03:40.503
Then you're just in time
to hear the great Reed Richards...

03:40.586 --> 03:42.880
ask me for help.

03:43.673 --> 03:47.635
You know, you made a lot of folks at MIT
feel like a junior high science fair.

03:47.718 --> 03:50.429
So you'll excuse me
if I savour the moment.

03:52.014 --> 03:55.685
You back this mission and I'll sign over
a fair percentage of any application...

03:55.768 --> 03:57.103
The number's 75%.

03:57.520 --> 03:59.188
And its applications and patents.

03:59.272 --> 04:01.399
- What about his first-born?
- Ben...

04:02.149 --> 04:03.401
Come on.

04:03.859 --> 04:07.738
25% of a billion is enough
to keep the lights on for a while, isn't it?

04:08.155 --> 04:11.617
Maybe even pay off your fourth mortgage
on the Baxter Building.

04:12.868 --> 04:13.995
Deal?

04:22.753 --> 04:25.381
Well, then. To our future.

04:27.883 --> 04:29.176
Together!

04:31.137 --> 04:33.556
It's funny how things turn out, isn't it?

04:34.557 --> 04:35.766
Hilarious.

04:38.728 --> 04:42.148
He knew about NASA.
Maybe he made the call to shut us down.

04:42.231 --> 04:45.568
Ben, think about all the people
we can help if this works.

04:45.901 --> 04:48.362
Look, we got what we wanted.
That's enough.

04:48.446 --> 04:51.365
A few days in space, it'll be great.
What's the worst that can happen?

04:56.370 --> 04:59.874
If Reed's right, this little trip
could double our stock offerings.

04:59.957 --> 05:02.293
- And if he's not...
- Reed's always right.

05:03.127 --> 05:05.880
Good thing he doesn't always know
what he's got.

05:15.348 --> 05:18.100
Reed, you should know those solar winds
have been picking up speed.

05:18.184 --> 05:19.894
I factored them into my coordinates.

05:19.977 --> 05:22.396
Right, of course you did. In theory.

05:22.480 --> 05:24.398
It's a little different once you're out there.

05:24.482 --> 05:26.734
- I can assure you I...
- When are we leaving?

05:28.778 --> 05:30.237
I'll be scheduling the launch...

05:30.321 --> 05:33.449
so you can call me in the morning
for resources and crew.

05:34.075 --> 05:36.911
- I think I remember the number.
- It's been changed.

05:43.376 --> 05:46.504
As far as crew, I was hoping
Ben could pilot the mission.

05:46.587 --> 05:50.132
We already have a pilot on our payroll,
but you're welcome to ride shotgun.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.009
Remember my brother, Johnny?

06:09.110 --> 06:11.487
Can't do it. Cannot do it.

06:11.570 --> 06:15.408
External SRBs, orbital system engines,
it's just like the shuttle you flew.

06:15.491 --> 06:18.494
No! I cannot take orders
from the underwear model.

06:18.578 --> 06:20.955
- Come on now, Ben.
- That wingnut washed out of NASA...

06:21.038 --> 06:24.709
for sneaking two Victoria's Secret
wannabes into a flight simulator.

06:24.792 --> 06:26.294
Youthful high spirits.

06:26.377 --> 06:30.172
They crashed it into a wall.
A flight simulator.

06:30.590 --> 06:32.383
When have I ever asked you
to do something...

06:32.466 --> 06:34.093
you absolutely said you could not do?

06:34.176 --> 06:35.303
Five times.

06:36.178 --> 06:38.598
- I had it at four.
- Well, this makes five.

06:48.774 --> 06:50.401
<i>Attention, all personnel.</i>

06:50.484 --> 06:53.613
<i>Commencing launch sequence
in six hours.</i>

06:53.696 --> 06:55.531
I miss you already, Debs.

06:55.615 --> 06:57.325
Captain on the bridge!

06:59.827 --> 07:03.956
Digital camera: $254. Memory stick: $59.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.293
The look on your hard-ass
former CO's face...

07:07.376 --> 07:09.879
when he finds out he's your junior officer:

07:10.379 --> 07:11.589
Priceless.

07:14.508 --> 07:15.885
Thank you. That's so sweet.

07:15.968 --> 07:17.762
I can handle the ship.

07:17.845 --> 07:20.181
I can even handle Mr. Blond Ambition.

07:20.264 --> 07:23.768
But I don't know whether I should be
flying or doing Swan Lake in these suits.

07:23.851 --> 07:26.896
- I mean, who the hell came up with these?
- Victor did.

07:26.979 --> 07:31.359
The synthetics act as a second skin,
adapting to your body's individual needs.

07:31.901 --> 07:34.403
See, now that means
it keeps the hot stuff hot...

07:34.487 --> 07:36.572
and it keeps the cool stuff cool.

07:37.114 --> 07:39.325
Wow. Fantastic.

07:39.951 --> 07:42.995
Material made from self-regulating
unstable molecules.

07:44.121 --> 07:46.499
I've been working on a formula for this.

07:47.458 --> 07:49.293
Great minds think alike.

07:52.171 --> 07:54.840
- Here you go, Ben.
- Thanks, sweetie.

07:54.924 --> 07:56.092
Reed.

08:29.041 --> 08:31.377
ETA until cosmic event: Nine hours.

08:31.836 --> 08:34.630
If you're good, maybe next time
Daddy'll let you drive.

08:34.714 --> 08:37.466
You keep talking
and there won't be a next time.

08:40.553 --> 08:44.432
Long way from the projection booth
at the Hayden Planetarium, isn't it?

08:48.853 --> 08:51.147
Yes. Yes, it is.

08:52.732 --> 08:56.444
We can monitor the cloud's approach
and observe the tests from here.

08:57.403 --> 08:58.529
Is it safe?

08:58.988 --> 09:01.657
The shields on the station
should protect us.

09:01.991 --> 09:03.159
Should?

09:03.242 --> 09:06.746
What's the matter, Ben?
Getting paranoid in your old age?

09:07.413 --> 09:11.167
Let's start loading those samples.
Get your suit ready, Ben.

09:12.627 --> 09:15.504
So I see you're still doing
all the heavy lifting.

09:16.005 --> 09:19.967
Maybe you should have stayed in the lab.
Fieldwork never suited you.

09:20.051 --> 09:23.471
He does the talking, I do the walking.
Got it?

09:24.639 --> 09:26.182
So take a walk, Ben.

09:26.807 --> 09:31.354
Actually, if you'll all excuse me,
I need to borrow Susan for a moment.

09:35.900 --> 09:37.026
Sure.

09:40.154 --> 09:43.407
Please tell me your guy's not trying
to rekindle things with my sister again.

09:43.491 --> 09:45.826
Of course not. It's strictly business.

09:45.910 --> 09:48.746
Yes, well, his eyes say differently,
don't they?

09:50.122 --> 09:54.085
Two hearts got busted last time.
Maybe she's not over it, either.

09:54.210 --> 09:57.630
Wow, Dr. Phil, that's deep.
Let's think about that.

09:57.964 --> 10:01.384
You got Victor, more money than God,
stud of the year.

10:02.218 --> 10:06.806
And you got Reed, world's dumbest smart
guy, worth less than a postage stamp.

10:07.682 --> 10:08.933
That's a real toss-up.

10:09.016 --> 10:11.185
Don't trouble your tiny little mind.

10:11.686 --> 10:13.437
Don't wander off now, boy.

10:15.898 --> 10:17.900
<i>Securing airlock chamber.</i>

10:37.545 --> 10:39.839
Surprised I agreed to Reed's proposal?

10:39.922 --> 10:42.008
I understand the business reasons.

10:43.384 --> 10:45.803
Well, when you're looking at your future...

10:45.886 --> 10:48.556
it doesn't hurt
to find closure about the past.

10:50.975 --> 10:54.979
Susan, every man dreams he'll meet
a woman he can give the world to.

10:56.606 --> 10:59.108
In my case, it's not just a metaphor.

11:03.988 --> 11:06.324
<i>Opening viewing station shield.</i>

11:36.354 --> 11:37.855
That can't be right.

11:38.981 --> 11:43.694
<i>Event threshold
in T-minus 9 minutes, 47 seconds.</i>

11:43.945 --> 11:46.656
That's impossible.
It should be seven hours.

11:51.577 --> 11:53.579
We've been together two years now.

11:53.663 --> 11:57.416
It's been a good two years, Victor.
The company's accomplished so much.

11:57.500 --> 11:59.543
Right, of course, the company.

12:01.295 --> 12:04.840
But, you see, I've come to realise that
all the accomplishments in the world...

12:04.924 --> 12:06.968
mean nothing without someone
to share them with.

12:07.051 --> 12:10.972
I've lived my life
unafraid of taking big steps.

12:11.639 --> 12:14.267
Now it's time to take the biggest step
of all.

12:14.350 --> 12:18.896
- Victor.
- If it helps, think of this as a promotion.

12:19.730 --> 12:22.316
- Victor, I...
- I have four words.

12:23.818 --> 12:26.904
Four little words that can change
our lives forever.

12:26.988 --> 12:28.990
The cloud is accelerating.

12:29.073 --> 12:31.867
We've got minutes until it hits, not hours.

12:32.243 --> 12:34.412
Victor, that storm is deadly.
We need to abort.

12:34.495 --> 12:38.165
Get a grip, Reed. We didn't come all this
way to lose our nerve at the first glitch.

12:38.249 --> 12:39.333
Just close the shields.

12:39.417 --> 12:41.877
- Ben is still out there.
- So reel him in.

12:41.961 --> 12:45.590
But we came here to do a job,
so let's do it quickly.

12:46.632 --> 12:49.927
Victor, Reed's right.
We have less than six minutes!

12:52.763 --> 12:55.558
- Ben, you need to get inside now.
- What's going on?

12:55.641 --> 12:58.019
<i>I ain't done
arranging your flowers yet, egghead.</i>

12:58.102 --> 12:59.604
<i>Ben, turn around!</i>

13:09.280 --> 13:10.656
<i>Guys, I'm not gonna make it.</i>

13:10.740 --> 13:12.825
Ben, you gotta jump. It's the only way!

13:18.122 --> 13:19.999
- What are you doing?
- Closing the shields.

13:20.082 --> 13:22.585
- You can't just leave them out there.
- Watch me.

13:24.170 --> 13:27.465
- You can't help them any more than I can.
- I can try.

13:43.105 --> 13:44.357
Come on, Ben, you got it!

13:47.652 --> 13:50.196
Okay, Johnny,
get ready to close the portal.

14:44.333 --> 14:46.335
Wake up. Ben.

14:47.878 --> 14:50.339
Rise and shine, big boy. How you feeling?

14:51.007 --> 14:52.300
Where am I?

14:52.383 --> 14:55.761
Back on Earth. We're in quarantine.
Victor's medical facility.

14:55.845 --> 14:57.430
Reed? Sue?

14:57.513 --> 15:00.182
They're fine. Everybody else is fine.

15:01.934 --> 15:03.436
What's wrong with me?

15:05.021 --> 15:07.982
I swear to you, Ben. They've done
everything humanly possible.

15:08.065 --> 15:10.067
The best plastic surgeons
in the world are here, Ben.

15:10.151 --> 15:11.193
You had the best.

15:11.277 --> 15:14.530
- Give me that mirror.
- I don't know if that's a good idea.

15:14.614 --> 15:17.867
- They said the shock alone...
- I said give me that goddamn mirror!

15:17.950 --> 15:20.953
Okay, Ben, just be strong.

15:25.541 --> 15:29.337
Unfortunately, the doctors
just couldn't do anything to fix your face.

15:35.134 --> 15:36.218
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:36.302 --> 15:39.305
Nice do. I'm liking the grandpa look.

15:40.056 --> 15:41.182
What?

15:59.367 --> 16:02.620
- How's she doing?
- Stable and her vitals are strong.

16:02.995 --> 16:05.581
Blood panels show no irradiation. Good.

16:06.290 --> 16:09.669
- You'll step up this protocol every...
- Every four hours, yes.

16:09.752 --> 16:11.420
We know what we're doing.

16:11.504 --> 16:13.965
Another day of observation
and you're all clear.

16:14.048 --> 16:16.884
Excuse me.
More flowers from Mr. Von Doom.

16:20.263 --> 16:22.139
She's allergic to orchids.

16:22.223 --> 16:25.184
Put the sunflowers by her bed,
they're her favourites.

16:43.119 --> 16:44.870
Well, Victor...

16:45.246 --> 16:47.415
the bank would like to congratulate you...

16:47.498 --> 16:50.042
on the fastest freefall
since the Depression.

16:50.126 --> 16:51.711
We can't even give your stock away.

16:51.794 --> 16:53.379
Ned, you know I can turn this around.

16:53.462 --> 16:56.465
Well, you're going to have to, Victor,
or we pull out.

16:58.968 --> 17:00.344
You have a week.

17:00.428 --> 17:02.680
You're enjoying this, aren't you, Ned?

17:06.809 --> 17:08.144
One week.

17:20.656 --> 17:22.575
Where do we think we're going?

17:22.657 --> 17:23.910
I don't know if we've noticed...

17:23.992 --> 17:26.996
but the sickest runs this side of the Alps
are right outside that window.

17:27.079 --> 17:29.624
Yeah, I've noticed,
but there are rules here.

17:29.707 --> 17:32.043
- You can't leave until we...
- Until we've finish the tests.

17:32.126 --> 17:36.505
I know, I've never been good with rules.
You let me know how those come out.

17:37.131 --> 17:40.843
- Do you wanna help me with this zipper?
- You know, this is not a ski resort.

17:40.927 --> 17:43.804
Not yet. Luckily, Grandma still sends
care packages, though.

17:43.888 --> 17:47.266
You know, it's amazing, for an 80-year-old
woman, you'd be surprised...

17:47.350 --> 17:50.519
- You are trouble.
- Trouble is my middle name.

17:50.603 --> 17:51.729
You're hot!

17:51.812 --> 17:54.023
Why, thank you. So are you.
And I'm not afraid to cry.

17:54.106 --> 17:55.608
No, I mean, you feel a little feverish.

17:55.691 --> 17:58.569
Well, I've never felt better in my life.
My God, you smell good.

17:58.653 --> 18:00.696
Listen, when do you get off work?

18:00.863 --> 18:02.531
- 4:00, but I...
- Tell you what.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.576
You meet me at 4:01
at the top of the mountain.

18:06.285 --> 18:09.872
That'll give you a minute to freshen up.
This is yours, that's mine.

18:10.623 --> 18:11.832
Nurses!

18:17.546 --> 18:19.257
How long was I out?

18:19.548 --> 18:20.591
Hey.

18:20.675 --> 18:23.469
Three days. Man, I was worried about you.

18:23.719 --> 18:25.888
- How are you feeling?
- Solid.

18:27.682 --> 18:29.892
- That was a close one, though, huh?
- Yeah.

18:29.976 --> 18:32.395
- What was that about?
- I don't know.

18:33.688 --> 18:35.398
I really don't know.

18:35.481 --> 18:39.235
I've been going over the figures
again and again and they all add up.

18:40.278 --> 18:42.238
I just don't understand.
Maybe I should have aborted...

18:42.321 --> 18:46.117
Reed, it was a freak of nature.
You couldn't have possibly predicted it.

18:46.200 --> 18:47.368
Let it go.

18:50.580 --> 18:52.248
You know, you live through
something like this...

18:52.331 --> 18:55.251
it really makes you appreciate
having the right woman in your life.

18:55.334 --> 18:58.921
- Yeah, you and Debbie are perfect.
- I'm not talking about Debbie.

19:01.007 --> 19:03.259
What? Come on.

19:03.593 --> 19:05.553
She's got a good thing with Victor.

19:05.636 --> 19:07.680
He's smart, he's powerful,
he's successful...

19:07.763 --> 19:09.682
Well, maybe you should date him then.

19:09.765 --> 19:12.560
Ben, she ended up with the right guy.

19:13.269 --> 19:15.271
Things worked out for the best.

19:18.858 --> 19:20.818
Do I have to do everything myself?

19:41.631 --> 19:43.507
All right.
I think you should stay to the right.

19:43.591 --> 19:45.426
The left might give you trouble.

19:45.509 --> 19:48.220
- I think we should drop, like, 10 more feet.
- Good.

19:48.304 --> 19:50.640
Last one down springs for room service!

19:58.356 --> 20:00.232
That's my future wife.

20:26.676 --> 20:28.052
You're losing!

20:29.095 --> 20:31.097
All right, no more kid's stuff.

20:31.973 --> 20:33.432
Check this out.

20:40.731 --> 20:42.316
You're on fire.

20:42.400 --> 20:44.026
Thanks! You're pretty good, too.

20:44.110 --> 20:46.904
No, you're on fire. Look!

21:21.939 --> 21:23.274
Care to join me?

21:31.407 --> 21:33.826
I can only stay for one drink
'cause I have to meet Victor.

21:33.910 --> 21:36.287
Well, wouldn't want to keep Vic waiting.

21:36.871 --> 21:39.206
Reed, what are you doing here?

21:39.373 --> 21:40.625
I thought...

21:42.793 --> 21:45.254
Great! Maybe you can join us.

21:46.255 --> 21:47.548
<i>How's the IPO now?</i>

21:47.632 --> 21:49.675
It's falling. We're looking at low 20s.

21:49.759 --> 21:51.844
It's a good number
considering the fallout from...

21:51.928 --> 21:53.387
From Reed's disaster?

21:53.471 --> 21:57.308
<i>Get me on the a.m. Shows,
Larry King, the cover of the Journal.</i>

21:58.726 --> 22:01.062
I have to do something about this scar.

22:02.021 --> 22:04.899
Make sure they only shoot me
from my left side.

22:05.191 --> 22:08.236
Actually, the scar's tracking well.

22:08.402 --> 22:10.655
People seem to think it humanises you.

22:12.198 --> 22:13.908
And that's a good thing?

22:17.495 --> 22:19.705
You know,
maybe you should get some rest.

22:19.789 --> 22:20.873
Later.

22:21.249 --> 22:23.709
First, I have some unfinished business.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.087
A deal that needs closing.

22:26.212 --> 22:29.173
Sir, I have always wondered, why Sue?

22:29.924 --> 22:31.926
You could have any other woman
in the world.

22:32.009 --> 22:35.179
That's why.
Because I could have any other woman.

22:36.097 --> 22:39.267
- No, let me tell the story.
- No, let him tell the story.

22:47.775 --> 22:50.319
- You all right?
- Yeah, bad shrimp.

22:51.445 --> 22:53.406
I think I better go lie down.

22:54.073 --> 22:55.241
Excuse me.

22:56.701 --> 22:57.952
Oh, God!

23:14.552 --> 23:15.970
<i>So, you feeling better?</i>

23:16.804 --> 23:18.556
Yes, thank you.

23:18.973 --> 23:20.141
Good.

23:21.309 --> 23:24.145
That's... good.

23:27.607 --> 23:29.650
You always had a way with words.

23:34.488 --> 23:37.158
Wow. I should be going because...

23:39.035 --> 23:40.661
I have to meet Victor.

23:40.745 --> 23:42.955
I'm really happy for you and Victor.

23:44.123 --> 23:46.000
You're really happy for me and Victor?

23:46.083 --> 23:49.670
I can tell you guys are enjoying
what was the best part of our relationship.

23:49.754 --> 23:51.547
- Which was?
- Passion...

23:53.174 --> 23:54.675
for science.

23:55.384 --> 23:58.012
You're such a dork, Reed.

23:58.554 --> 24:00.139
You never got it...

24:01.140 --> 24:02.850
- and you never will...
- Well, what did I say?

24:02.934 --> 24:04.936
...unless it's explained to you
in quantum physics.

24:05.019 --> 24:06.312
I just wanted to let you know that I...

24:06.395 --> 24:08.940
It's been two years,
and all you can say is that you're happy...

24:09.023 --> 24:11.025
for me and some other guy?

24:11.108 --> 24:12.944
Victor may be a lot of things.

24:13.027 --> 24:16.155
But at least he's not afraid
to fight for what he wants.

24:16.364 --> 24:18.741
It's nice to be wanted sometimes, Reed.

24:20.534 --> 24:23.371
To be seen and heard.

24:26.582 --> 24:28.000
Look at me.

24:30.586 --> 24:31.671
I can't.

24:31.754 --> 24:33.673
What do you mean, you can't?
Look at me!

24:33.756 --> 24:35.549
Sue, look at your hands!

24:54.986 --> 24:56.696
Hey, you guys.

24:57.822 --> 25:00.408
You are never gonna believe
what just happened to me.

25:00.491 --> 25:01.659
What?

25:02.994 --> 25:05.121
Well, I can explain this.

25:32.565 --> 25:35.943
It has to be the cloud.
It's fundamentally altered our DNA.

25:36.027 --> 25:37.612
Let's not jump to conclusions.

25:37.695 --> 25:40.615
We need a massive amount of evidence
before making that leap.

25:40.698 --> 25:42.283
Guys, look!

25:52.793 --> 25:55.963
Now, picture that, but everywhere.

25:57.131 --> 25:59.300
It was everywhere.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.344
What?

26:03.262 --> 26:05.806
The cloud has fundamentally altered
our DNA.

26:06.974 --> 26:09.018
- Cool!
- We need to find Ben.

26:09.101 --> 26:11.312
And you know what, guys?
I think I was flying.

26:18.194 --> 26:19.695
I said, cut it out, Johnny.

26:19.779 --> 26:21.239
I'm getting the hang of it.

26:21.322 --> 26:23.491
- Ben, it's Reed.
- Stop.

26:23.574 --> 26:25.034
- All right.
- All right?

26:25.117 --> 26:26.452
- Yes.
- God!

26:26.535 --> 26:27.870
- God?
- What's wrong with you?

26:27.954 --> 26:29.080
- What?
- Sue, do you know the code?

26:29.163 --> 26:30.206
I might.

26:38.422 --> 26:39.674
Ben, open up.

26:39.757 --> 26:40.800
You all right, Ben?

26:40.883 --> 26:42.969
Does somebody have keys to these doors?

26:43.886 --> 26:45.179
Anybody?

26:46.430 --> 26:48.599
Just break the glass. It can't be that thick.

26:48.683 --> 26:51.686
Give me another couple of seconds, guys.
I almost got it.

27:32.059 --> 27:33.311
That's gross.

27:39.233 --> 27:40.318
Ben?

27:41.193 --> 27:42.570
Look.

27:46.115 --> 27:47.283
What is that thing?

27:49.535 --> 27:50.870
What's going on?

27:51.746 --> 27:53.039
What happened in here?

27:53.122 --> 27:54.707
Victor, are you feeling all right?

27:54.790 --> 27:56.459
I'm fine. Just a few scrapes, that's all.

27:56.542 --> 27:57.835
Ben did this.

27:57.919 --> 28:01.088
He's had some kind of reaction
to exposure from the cloud.

28:01.631 --> 28:04.050
We all have different symptoms.

28:04.133 --> 28:05.301
Symptoms?

28:05.384 --> 28:08.346
- Victor, I should have...
- Just find him.

28:11.182 --> 28:13.893
Anybody got any ideas
where the big guy's going?

28:17.730 --> 28:19.232
He's going home.

28:58.312 --> 29:00.314
You gotta be kidding me.

29:07.280 --> 29:08.614
Little buttons.

29:09.198 --> 29:10.700
Hello, Operator?

29:14.120 --> 29:15.871
<i>- Hello?
- Debs?</i>

29:16.497 --> 29:18.124
<i>- It's me.
- Ben?</i>

29:19.000 --> 29:21.627
<i>Are you all right?
You sound a little different.</i>

29:21.794 --> 29:24.630
<i>- Listen, I need you to come out front.
- Out front?</i>

29:25.298 --> 29:26.841
<i>You're home, baby?</i>

29:27.675 --> 29:28.718
<i>Yeah.</i>

29:31.137 --> 29:33.139
<i>I got a surprise for you.</i>

29:35.099 --> 29:37.977
Yeah, I got a little one for you, too.

29:41.772 --> 29:42.940
Ben?

29:46.319 --> 29:47.820
Where are you?

29:48.154 --> 29:49.655
I'm over here.

29:50.323 --> 29:52.825
Don't come any closer for a sec, okay?

29:53.868 --> 29:57.038
It's gonna be a bit of a shock.

29:57.121 --> 29:58.998
Honey, what's going on?

29:59.332 --> 30:00.541
Debs...

30:01.667 --> 30:04.003
remember when we used to say...

30:04.337 --> 30:07.256
together forever no matter what?

30:08.049 --> 30:09.216
Yeah.

30:10.593 --> 30:11.928
Well...

30:12.345 --> 30:14.180
Baby, you're scaring me.

30:28.194 --> 30:29.362
Oh, my God.

30:30.029 --> 30:32.865
Deb, it's me. It's still me.

30:32.949 --> 30:34.742
It was the accident. Let me explain.

30:34.825 --> 30:36.994
- No! Don't touch me!
- Debs!

30:44.001 --> 30:45.670
I'm calling the police.

30:45.753 --> 30:46.879
Everybody all right?

30:46.963 --> 30:49.465
I saw him. It's that guy over there!

30:57.682 --> 30:59.976
Okay, so he was there last night.

31:00.059 --> 31:02.311
Debbie's gonna meet us
on the other side of the bridge.

31:16.909 --> 31:18.411
Yeah, Ben.

31:18.661 --> 31:21.122
"A few days in space. It'll be great.

31:21.914 --> 31:24.208
"What's the worst that could happen?"

31:28.254 --> 31:29.589
Hey, little guy.

31:31.632 --> 31:33.759
You're not afraid of me, are you?

31:39.432 --> 31:40.558
Perfect.

31:42.101 --> 31:43.269
Thanks.

31:57.658 --> 31:58.826
Hey!

32:00.328 --> 32:03.456
You think you've got problems?
You take a good look, pal.

32:04.665 --> 32:06.542
How bad could it be, right?

32:06.959 --> 32:08.794
I don't think you...

32:10.379 --> 32:14.133
Okay, pal. Take it easy.
No, don't go out there.

32:14.216 --> 32:16.802
Look, I said stop, you fruitcake!

32:16.886 --> 32:18.679
No. Come close.

32:19.347 --> 32:21.766
That's further. Come closer.

32:21.849 --> 32:24.101
I said, stop! No!

32:48.668 --> 32:50.002
Come here.

33:13.609 --> 33:16.153
All right, calm down.

33:17.863 --> 33:19.365
You wanna be scared?

33:19.448 --> 33:21.242
- Fine!
- No!

33:31.544 --> 33:33.379
Get back, everybody!

33:33.504 --> 33:36.382
Get back in your vehicle.
We'll tell you when you can go.

33:36.465 --> 33:39.677
- What do we do now?
- We're not going to get past these guys.

33:39.760 --> 33:41.137
But you could.

33:45.683 --> 33:48.352
Sorry about the truck, pal. Come on.

33:48.895 --> 33:51.772
A little help, here?
You wanna hit the button, sir?

33:52.064 --> 33:53.357
It's stuck.

33:55.026 --> 33:57.153
Sue, your clothes. Lose them.

33:57.862 --> 33:59.030
Right.

33:59.655 --> 34:01.407
This is so wrong.

34:09.790 --> 34:12.376
- Wow, you've been working out.
- Shut up!

34:14.337 --> 34:15.420
All right.

34:19.467 --> 34:21.260
All right, freeze!

34:21.677 --> 34:23.054
Now just...

34:23.679 --> 34:26.223
Just put the man in the seat down.

34:27.433 --> 34:28.643
Do it!

34:33.856 --> 34:35.233
Any more great ideas?

34:35.315 --> 34:37.818
Why don't you strip down
and have a 100 people stare at you?

34:37.902 --> 34:39.695
- Sue.
- What?

34:44.242 --> 34:45.909
I'm gonna need therapy.

34:47.995 --> 34:50.039
Come on, let's get out of here.

34:51.873 --> 34:53.918
Excuse me. Coming through.

34:58.464 --> 35:01.759
All right, now just back away from him.

35:03.678 --> 35:06.639
And I want you to put your hands
on your head...

35:14.814 --> 35:16.315
954 approaching scene.

35:16.440 --> 35:18.442
I still can't believe you made me do that.

35:18.526 --> 35:20.945
We got through, didn't we? Just find Ben.

35:28.119 --> 35:30.079
Ben!

35:38.462 --> 35:39.630
Mum.

36:25.843 --> 36:27.261
Stay here, okay?

36:27.386 --> 36:28.679
I'm coming.

36:29.138 --> 36:30.222
Hold on.

37:13.266 --> 37:14.517
Hang on!

37:20.898 --> 37:21.983
I got you.

38:01.272 --> 38:03.858
<i>Get down on the ground.</i>

38:05.109 --> 38:07.111
<i>Get down on the ground now!</i>

38:12.408 --> 38:13.451
Ben.

39:27.275 --> 39:28.859
I swear to you...

39:29.569 --> 39:32.029
I will do everything in my power...

39:32.113 --> 39:34.490
until there is not a breath left in me.

39:36.200 --> 39:38.119
You're going to be Ben again.

39:48.421 --> 39:50.047
I told you I felt fine.

39:51.215 --> 39:52.800
Where are your ears?

39:56.262 --> 39:59.181
There are some folks outside
that want to talk to you.

39:59.265 --> 40:00.975
We're not going public with this.

40:01.058 --> 40:02.852
We're scientists, not celebrities.

40:02.935 --> 40:04.395
It's too late, son.

40:04.770 --> 40:05.855
Look.

40:06.898 --> 40:08.816
<i>... when a New York Fire Department
ladder truck...</i>

40:08.900 --> 40:09.942
See that?

40:10.026 --> 40:11.193
<i>... became part of the tragedy.</i>

40:11.277 --> 40:13.654
<i>But the rescue itself is not the story.</i>

40:13.738 --> 40:16.240
<i>One of the four stretched
to an amazing length...</i>

40:16.324 --> 40:19.660
That's what they're calling you.
"The Fantastic Four."

40:19.744 --> 40:22.038
- Cool.
- No, wait! Where are you going?

40:22.121 --> 40:23.247
I'm gonna go talk to them.

40:23.331 --> 40:25.374
No, we should think this through.

40:25.458 --> 40:27.418
That's great. Brainstorm.

40:31.380 --> 40:33.799
Get back here, right now. Johnny!

40:36.469 --> 40:37.887
Settle down.

40:40.306 --> 40:42.016
Do you believe this?

40:42.808 --> 40:44.477
Which one of you is the leader?

40:44.560 --> 40:46.187
That would be me.

40:46.270 --> 40:47.813
No, seriously.

40:50.107 --> 40:51.776
Okay, son. You're on.

41:00.201 --> 41:03.663
During our recent mission
to the Von Doom space station...

41:05.289 --> 41:08.417
we were exposed to
as yet unidentified radioactive energy.

41:08.501 --> 41:10.169
- What happened on the bridge?
- How can you stretch?

41:10.253 --> 41:12.088
- Were you really on fire?
- Is it true you can fly?

41:12.171 --> 41:14.173
Yeah, I'm working on it.
It's actually really difficult.

41:14.257 --> 41:16.759
No, actually, we do not know
much more than you do at this point.

41:18.594 --> 41:20.805
Sir, Larry King just cancelled.

41:21.305 --> 41:23.599
Apparently, there's a bigger story.

41:26.644 --> 41:30.273
<i>Actually, here they come now.
You had to see it to believe it, folks.</i>

41:30.356 --> 41:32.900
<i>- The man...
...named The Fantastic Four...</i>

41:32.984 --> 41:35.945
<i>We'll be going directly to our lab
to diagnose our symptoms.</i>

41:36.028 --> 41:37.780
<i>Symptoms? Is this some kind of disease?</i>

41:37.863 --> 41:40.366
No. It's not a disease.

41:41.367 --> 41:44.328
If having special powers is a disease,
then, yeah, we got it bad.

41:44.412 --> 41:46.956
Excuse me,
that thing doesn't look so fantastic.

41:47.039 --> 41:49.292
Ben Grimm is a genuine American hero.

41:49.375 --> 41:51.836
What he means is,
every team needs a mascot.

41:53.045 --> 41:57.258
A new day is dawning.
The day of The Fantastic Four.

42:00.511 --> 42:01.929
Look!

42:02.054 --> 42:05.600
<i>We went up to space
to find a way to understand DNA...</i>

42:06.058 --> 42:08.019
<i>cure disease, save lives.</i>

42:08.102 --> 42:12.690
<i>Well, now it's our DNA, our disease,
our lives on the line.</i>

42:14.025 --> 42:16.277
<i>Thank you. No more questions.</i>

42:17.528 --> 42:19.822
This is how you turn things around?

42:20.364 --> 42:23.910
These freaks on the front page?
Your company's in the obituaries?

42:24.327 --> 42:25.828
I was planning to use the publicity.

42:25.912 --> 42:29.081
The board's in agreement,
the bank's lost enough already.

42:29.707 --> 42:31.834
- Wait a minute.
- It's too late, Victor.

42:31.918 --> 42:35.880
Do you know how much money
I've invested in this company?

42:35.963 --> 42:37.214
Victor, stop.

42:38.049 --> 42:40.760
This isn't a negotiation. It's a notification.

42:42.136 --> 42:43.638
We're pulling out.

43:26.055 --> 43:28.182
Is all that for you, Dr. Richards?

43:28.266 --> 43:29.559
I'm afraid so.

43:32.645 --> 43:35.982
Come on, Ben, smile.
They want to like you, Ben. Say hi.

43:40.444 --> 43:41.946
Don't do drugs.

43:53.583 --> 43:56.419
Welcome back to the Baxter, Dr. Richards.

43:56.502 --> 43:58.629
I've got the usual for you.

43:58.713 --> 44:00.423
Good to have you back, sir.

44:00.506 --> 44:01.757
Thanks, Willie.

44:04.594 --> 44:05.928
We had a tough year.

44:06.012 --> 44:08.180
Yeah, like nine straight.

44:21.903 --> 44:24.530
Either we're moving really fast
or not at all.

44:32.747 --> 44:34.540
I'll take the stairs.

44:43.799 --> 44:46.218
How come Ben can't turn it on and off
like we can?

44:46.302 --> 44:48.137
That's what we're here to find out.

44:48.220 --> 44:50.306
I mean, if it happened to him...

44:50.389 --> 44:53.768
What? You mean, like, we won't be able
to turn it off, either?

44:54.143 --> 44:55.228
That would save time.

44:55.311 --> 44:58.314
You don't really wanna walk around on fire
for the rest of your life, do you?

44:58.397 --> 45:00.066
- Is that a trick question?
- Grow up.

45:00.149 --> 45:03.110
Come on.
Am I the only guy who thinks this is cool?

45:04.362 --> 45:07.573
We should stay here until we can define
the extent of our changes...

45:07.657 --> 45:10.117
and figure out how to reverse them.

45:14.080 --> 45:17.833
But I have to warn you, it's gonna be
a little crowded in some areas.

45:24.382 --> 45:26.050
So, what do you think?

45:27.343 --> 45:31.347
I don't know, Reed, I think you might be
bringing your work home with you.

45:31.806 --> 45:34.850
Come on. Let me show you guys
where you'll be staying.

45:35.977 --> 45:37.228
Busy guy.

45:43.734 --> 45:47.363
Mr. Von Doom, would you like to comment
on the recent failure of your IPO?

45:47.446 --> 45:49.365
What about the rumours of a takeover?

46:11.637 --> 46:13.306
God, I was so worried about you.

46:13.472 --> 46:16.684
Victor. I'm sorry
I didn't get a chance to call.

46:17.351 --> 46:18.519
Please.

46:19.145 --> 46:20.396
No apologies.

46:21.355 --> 46:24.567
I've arranged for your things to be moved
to one of my condos.

46:24.650 --> 46:26.319
You'll have round-the-clock care.

46:26.402 --> 46:28.654
Thank you. That's very generous of you.

46:28.738 --> 46:31.532
But I think I should stay here
with my brother...

46:32.033 --> 46:34.035
until we get a handle on things.

46:34.118 --> 46:37.288
Susan, I think you should let my doctors
have a look at you.

46:37.371 --> 46:40.207
Victor, what are you doing here?

46:42.043 --> 46:44.337
I'm starting to wonder the same thing.

46:45.880 --> 46:48.257
How much do you know
about what happened to you?

46:48.341 --> 46:49.425
Not much.

46:49.508 --> 46:51.719
We need to run tests
to see the extent of the damage.

46:51.802 --> 46:55.473
Well, you let me know what I can do.
We're all in this together now.

47:04.774 --> 47:06.317
Victor, wait.

47:07.777 --> 47:11.572
I just wanted to say I'm sorry
the mission didn't go as planned.

47:11.948 --> 47:14.784
Didn't go as planned?
It was a catastrophe.

47:14.992 --> 47:17.203
You ruined the lives of four people.

47:17.286 --> 47:20.081
With all due respect, we're both to blame.
I told you to abort.

47:20.164 --> 47:21.290
Abort?

47:21.374 --> 47:24.585
I put my company, my name,
billions of dollars on the line.

47:24.669 --> 47:27.338
I will not let you make me look like a fool.

47:27.421 --> 47:28.756
Victor, if we can understand...

47:28.839 --> 47:32.093
I don't wanna understand it!
This isn't one of your science projects!

47:32.176 --> 47:34.595
I just wanna fix it. Fast!

47:35.805 --> 47:37.640
Is there a problem?

47:43.187 --> 47:44.313
No.

47:45.606 --> 47:46.941
No problem, Ben.

47:47.608 --> 47:51.320
Just pay your damn electric bill
and get to work on finding a cure.

48:26.230 --> 48:28.316
He's heating up from his core.

48:28.399 --> 48:30.401
And his vitals are completely normal.

48:30.484 --> 48:33.654
If we're going to identify
the source of the mutation...

48:33.738 --> 48:35.823
we need to isolate
your recombinant DNA...

48:35.907 --> 48:38.284
so we can activate positional genomes.

48:38.367 --> 48:41.245
We have to do a physical
in order to see what got zapped.

48:41.329 --> 48:43.331
Why didn't you just say so?

48:43.998 --> 48:46.500
His internal organs are completely solid.

48:49.545 --> 48:51.088
How bad is it?

48:51.505 --> 48:53.257
You know, I used to smoke.

48:55.301 --> 48:57.386
It's not invisibility per se.

48:57.470 --> 49:01.224
You should be able to bend light
around other objects, even people...

49:01.307 --> 49:04.101
if you could control
your emotional state better.

49:04.185 --> 49:05.353
Excuse me?

49:05.436 --> 49:08.940
I'm saying, if you had a little more
self-control, you could locate the trigger.

49:09.023 --> 49:12.276
Can you remember your exact emotions
on the bridge?

49:12.360 --> 49:13.527
Anger.

49:14.362 --> 49:15.529
Rage.

49:16.197 --> 49:17.365
Frustration.

49:17.448 --> 49:19.867
Okay. Is there any way
to duplicate that feeling?

49:19.951 --> 49:21.702
Some memory or...

49:22.870 --> 49:25.164
I'm sure I can come up with something.

49:25.248 --> 49:27.667
- You feel anything?
- Nope.

49:28.793 --> 49:29.877
Okay.

49:36.217 --> 49:38.010
It's hotter than I anticipated.

49:38.094 --> 49:40.721
<i>- Okay, Johnny, back it down.
- I can go hotter!</i>

49:41.055 --> 49:42.765
<i>Johnny, just back it down.</i>

49:52.400 --> 49:54.860
- Johnny, back it down right now!
- Johnny!

50:00.825 --> 50:04.495
Buzz kill!
You guys are cramping my style.

50:04.579 --> 50:06.914
Johnny, you were at 4,000 Kelvin.

50:06.998 --> 50:09.250
Any hotter
and you're approaching supernova.

50:09.333 --> 50:11.335
- Sweet!
- No, not sweet!

50:11.419 --> 50:13.254
That's the temperature of the sun.

50:13.337 --> 50:15.089
Not only could you kill yourself...

50:15.172 --> 50:16.882
but you could set fire
to Earth's atmosphere...

50:16.966 --> 50:19.051
and destroy all human life as we know it.

50:19.135 --> 50:22.221
Got it. Supernova: Bad.

50:29.270 --> 50:30.938
How's that coming?

50:38.029 --> 50:40.448
- I'm so sorry. Are you okay?
- Yeah, fine.

50:40.531 --> 50:42.158
- You sure?
- Yeah.

50:42.241 --> 50:43.451
I...

50:44.744 --> 50:48.039
You probably thought
that was some form of latent hostility.

50:48.164 --> 50:50.625
What in the world
would give me that idea?

50:56.088 --> 50:58.257
I mean, you broke up with me, right?

50:58.883 --> 51:00.259
- Are you kidding?
- No.

51:00.343 --> 51:03.304
I distinctly remember,
you walked out my door, ergo...

51:03.387 --> 51:06.515
I was ready for the next step, you weren't.
Ergo, I walked.

51:06.599 --> 51:08.643
I think it was a little bit more
complicated than that.

51:08.726 --> 51:12.647
I just wanted to share an apartment.
What was so complicated about that?

51:13.105 --> 51:15.983
- There were a lot of variables to consider.
- No, there weren't.

51:16.067 --> 51:20.071
There was you and me.
There were no variables, no math.

51:20.154 --> 51:22.406
It was actually
the simplest thing in the world.

51:22.490 --> 51:24.367
But like always, Reed,
your head got in the way.

51:24.450 --> 51:26.535
- No, it didn't.
- Then what was it?

51:29.997 --> 51:32.124
Did you feel anything when I left?

51:34.377 --> 51:36.420
Do you feel anything right now?

51:39.131 --> 51:40.258
Hey, guys.

51:42.677 --> 51:44.804
I think we have a serious problem.

51:58.484 --> 52:00.194
So what's the prognosis?

52:00.486 --> 52:04.907
Your tissue, your organs, your entire
biophysical structure is changing.

52:04.991 --> 52:07.493
Every system is still functioning somehow.

52:07.994 --> 52:09.579
And it's changing into?

52:09.662 --> 52:11.205
I don't really know.

52:11.289 --> 52:14.375
Some kind of organic-metallic alloy...

52:14.834 --> 52:18.212
stronger than titanium or carbon steel,
harder than diamonds.

52:18.671 --> 52:21.173
Like the shields
Reed said would protect us.

52:26.637 --> 52:27.889
How long?

52:28.014 --> 52:31.726
At this rate, the infection could be
complete in two, maybe three weeks.

52:31.809 --> 52:33.311
What do you mean complete?

52:33.394 --> 52:34.979
I wish I could tell you.

52:35.062 --> 52:38.024
I can't pretend to know
what we're dealing with here.

52:39.191 --> 52:41.277
I'll have to notify the CDC.

52:41.360 --> 52:43.237
- What?
- Centre for Disease Control.

52:43.321 --> 52:44.363
I know what it is.

52:44.447 --> 52:47.825
If this thing is contagious, we may have
a big problem on our hands.

52:47.909 --> 52:50.202
We're talking about an epidemic here.

52:50.953 --> 52:52.079
Look at me.

52:54.206 --> 52:55.458
I have a life.

52:56.125 --> 52:58.586
I'm the face of a billion-dollar company.

53:00.046 --> 53:02.757
We need to keep this confidential.

53:02.840 --> 53:07.178
Victor, this disease is progressive,
degenerative. I have to notify someone...

53:07.887 --> 53:09.430
That's terrible news.

53:17.396 --> 53:19.398
But I think I'll get a second opinion.

53:49.095 --> 53:51.681
Our uniforms were exposed
to the storm, like us.

53:51.764 --> 53:53.683
So they can transform like us.

53:54.016 --> 53:57.645
Becoming invisible, changing size on
demand or remaining impervious to flame.

53:57.728 --> 53:59.939
You guys look like an '80s rock band.

54:00.022 --> 54:02.358
You know, Ben, this material stretches.

54:02.441 --> 54:04.860
I'm sure I can figure out a way
to make it fit.

54:05.111 --> 54:06.904
I wouldn't be caught dead wearing that.

54:06.988 --> 54:10.241
I love these costumes. They're missing
something, though. Needs, like, spice.

54:10.324 --> 54:11.492
They're not costumes.

54:11.576 --> 54:13.911
You can't use your powers in public,
Johnny.

54:13.995 --> 54:17.248
- You guys are worse than NASA.
- You could burn somebody.

54:17.331 --> 54:19.458
Maybe it's missing a utility belt.

54:24.880 --> 54:26.340
Here you go, there's your change.

54:28.092 --> 54:29.677
Can I help you, buddy?

54:30.261 --> 54:33.097
- Oh, my.
- It's Sue Storm, it's the Invisible Woman!

54:33.222 --> 54:36.350
Sue Storm, it is you.
Listen, my kid loves you!

54:44.984 --> 54:47.236
I can't believe I'm doing this again.

54:56.037 --> 54:58.497
Reed, we really can't go outside anymore.

54:58.581 --> 55:00.917
<i>We are on the cover of every publication
from People...</i>

55:01.000 --> 55:04.879
All right, I'm here, let's make this quick.
I got a lot of places to go today.

55:04.962 --> 55:07.757
Oh, wait. I don't go anywhere.

55:07.840 --> 55:11.427
Johnny, it's imperative that we stay inside
for the foreseeable future.

55:11.510 --> 55:14.847
I know, but when you said that last time,
my brain heard "a week."

55:14.931 --> 55:17.141
Johnny, it's too dangerous
for you to be in public.

55:17.225 --> 55:18.517
You've been saying that for years.

55:18.601 --> 55:20.853
What worries me is
that our powers are evolving.

55:20.937 --> 55:22.688
I know!

55:23.147 --> 55:25.858
I am so close to flying, guys, I can taste it.

55:25.942 --> 55:27.860
- You can't fly.
- Yet.

55:27.944 --> 55:30.112
Johnny, can you put that napkin out?

55:30.196 --> 55:31.364
Jesus.

55:32.657 --> 55:35.701
So what's going on, Reed?
How're you going to cure us?

55:35.868 --> 55:38.704
I'm going to build a machine
to recreate the storm.

55:39.163 --> 55:42.792
The cosmic rays will travel
from this generator to this chamber.

55:42.875 --> 55:44.210
What, no pop-ups?

55:44.543 --> 55:48.547
- If I can reverse the wave signal...
- It'll return us back to normal.

55:52.051 --> 55:53.970
Right. But what are the risks?

55:54.053 --> 55:57.974
Even a small miscalculation could increase
our symptoms exponentially...

55:58.266 --> 55:59.600
or perhaps even kill us.

55:59.684 --> 56:02.395
Now, dying. That's bad, right?

56:02.895 --> 56:05.064
I say we just let sleeping dogs lie, guys.

56:05.147 --> 56:07.567
So how long
till this contraption's up and running?

56:07.650 --> 56:09.569
- I don't know, it's hard to say.
- How long, Reed?

56:09.652 --> 56:11.487
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

56:11.571 --> 56:14.740
- You don't want this to get worse.
- Worse than that?

56:14.824 --> 56:19.412
Guys, look, we're gonna be stuck here
for a while, so let's just try and get along.

56:35.595 --> 56:37.763
- You could knock!
- Sorry!

57:13.215 --> 57:14.759
Johnny!

57:18.930 --> 57:22.600
<i>More bad news for Von Doom Industries
today as Ned Cecil announced...</i>

57:22.683 --> 57:25.019
<i>that his group of investors
would seek to gain control...</i>

57:25.102 --> 57:27.647
<i>of Victor Von Doom 's numerous
technology companies.</i>

57:27.730 --> 57:29.941
<i>Earlier, the IPO was pulled
from the market...</i>

57:30.024 --> 57:32.818
<i>after the steady decline
of its projected opening price.</i>

57:32.902 --> 57:36.989
<i>Von Doom Industries was never able
to overcome the negative publicity...</i>

57:58.928 --> 58:00.096
Interesting.

58:26.581 --> 58:27.665
Hello?

58:33.462 --> 58:34.672
Victor?

58:37.883 --> 58:39.844
What's with these lights, huh?

58:40.094 --> 58:43.264
About the IPO, no hard feelings, right?

58:44.223 --> 58:45.558
Nothing personal.

58:50.021 --> 58:54.066
You know, you could always move back
to Latveria.

58:54.817 --> 58:56.110
Start fresh.

58:56.736 --> 58:59.697
Maybe that's where you belong,
the old country.

59:14.921 --> 59:16.547
Nothing personal, Ned.

59:18.049 --> 59:19.800
But I'm not going anywhere.

59:33.022 --> 59:35.691
<i>... assassinated the competition
everywhere this season.</i>

59:35.775 --> 59:39.946
<i>Truly unbelievable.
The crowd is going nuts here at the arena.</i>

59:40.029 --> 59:43.449
<i>I tell you, if there's anybody out there
who can do what these guys do...</i>

59:43.532 --> 59:46.369
<i>we dare you to come on down here.
Look at this spread-eagle...</i>

59:46.452 --> 59:49.121
<i>no arm, back of the seat.
Motorbike grab, landed...</i>

59:49.205 --> 59:50.623
I got to get out of here.

01:00:09.684 --> 01:00:12.061
Hey, pretty boy, let's see what you got.

01:00:16.691 --> 01:00:19.151
Where's your hot sister and the monster?

01:00:22.321 --> 01:00:23.447
Let's go!

01:00:40.965 --> 01:00:42.091
<i>All right.</i>

01:00:42.174 --> 01:00:45.845
<i>I want you all to make a lot of noise
now for a very special guest.</i>

01:00:46.304 --> 01:00:50.016
<i>Mr. Johnny Storm
from The Fantastic Four!</i>

01:00:56.272 --> 01:00:57.815
<i>Look at that lift!</i>

01:01:03.487 --> 01:01:05.114
<i>That was fantastic!</i>

01:01:06.324 --> 01:01:09.452
<i>But, Johnny, come on. That's old school.</i>

01:01:09.535 --> 01:01:11.412
<i>Show us something new.</i>

01:01:13.456 --> 01:01:14.707
Something new.

01:01:15.666 --> 01:01:16.834
You got it.

01:01:25.635 --> 01:01:27.470
<i>Come on, Johnny, come on!</i>

01:01:28.095 --> 01:01:29.597
<i>Is he flying?</i>

01:01:30.348 --> 01:01:31.599
Wait, no!

01:01:41.734 --> 01:01:44.028
That's dangerous.

01:01:46.948 --> 01:01:50.368
I'm okay, I'm all right, I'm good.

01:01:50.534 --> 01:01:52.536
<i>He's okay! He's all right!</i>

01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:55.373
<i>Johnny Storm, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:59.835
<i>I have to give you props, Johnny!
You were on fire!</i>

01:02:10.596 --> 01:02:12.890
- He didn't.
- Oh, yes, he did.

01:02:13.349 --> 01:02:16.769
- Flame Boy never listens.
- What did he do to his uniform?

01:02:18.771 --> 01:02:21.023
<i>Johnny, I've gotta ask you
about this outfit.</i>

01:02:21.107 --> 01:02:23.192
Yeah, it's sort of
Armani meets astronaut.

01:02:23.276 --> 01:02:25.069
So what are your superhero names?

01:02:25.152 --> 01:02:28.531
They call me The Human Torch.
Ladies call me Torch.

01:02:29.031 --> 01:02:30.783
What about the rest of the team?

01:02:30.866 --> 01:02:32.785
<i>- That's the Invisible Girl.
- Girl?</i>

01:02:32.868 --> 01:02:36.247
<i>What about your leader, Reed Richards?
I hear you call him Mr. Fantastic.</i>

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:37.832
- Could've been worse.
- I guess.

01:02:37.915 --> 01:02:42.128
<i>Is it true what they say about him that
he can expand any part of his anatomy?</i>

01:02:43.629 --> 01:02:46.382
<i>Well, I've always found him
to be a little limp.</i>

01:02:47.925 --> 01:02:50.428
What is that?
What do you call that thing?

01:02:50.511 --> 01:02:52.513
<i>That's it. The Thing.</i>

01:02:52.597 --> 01:02:55.016
<i>Yeah, you think this is bad,
you should have seen him before.</i>

01:02:55.099 --> 01:02:57.268
Okay. Now I'm gonna go kill him.

01:03:05.276 --> 01:03:06.569
There he is.

01:03:13.993 --> 01:03:15.828
- Johnny!
- Can we talk about this later, guys?

01:03:15.912 --> 01:03:18.164
- No. We can't talk about this later.
- We can do this at home.

01:03:18.247 --> 01:03:20.708
- What are you thinking?
- Where's my ride?

01:03:32.720 --> 01:03:34.055
You think that's funny, Pebbles?

01:03:34.138 --> 01:03:35.181
- Johnny!
- What?

01:03:35.264 --> 01:03:37.516
You gave us names? You don't think.

01:03:37.600 --> 01:03:39.810
So now you're the face
of The Fantastic Four?

01:03:39.894 --> 01:03:41.854
A face that's about to be broken!

01:03:41.938 --> 01:03:43.481
Look, this isn't permanent, Johnny.

01:03:43.564 --> 01:03:45.691
We need to be careful
until we're normal again.

01:03:45.775 --> 01:03:48.569
What if I don't wanna be normal?
I didn't turn into a monster!

01:03:49.070 --> 01:03:50.196
Ben!

01:04:00.122 --> 01:04:01.499
Did you just...

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:03.376
Johnny, stop it.

01:04:03.459 --> 01:04:05.419
- That's it, Tinkerbell!
- No, Ben.

01:04:05.503 --> 01:04:07.797
You wanna fly? Then fly!

01:04:13.803 --> 01:04:17.348
Wait a minute, guys! Ben, don't do this!

01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:19.725
Let's see if we can get blood
from a stone.

01:04:19.809 --> 01:04:21.852
Let's see. Bring it, burnout!

01:04:21.936 --> 01:04:23.646
You two need a time-out!

01:04:26.399 --> 01:04:27.984
Talk to blockhead, he started it.

01:04:28.067 --> 01:04:30.736
I don't care. Damn it, Johnny.

01:04:32.196 --> 01:04:33.406
Ben, wait!

01:04:34.448 --> 01:04:35.533
What?

01:04:38.202 --> 01:04:41.539
You need to control yourself
and think before you act.

01:04:41.622 --> 01:04:44.959
Yeah, but see, that's your problem.
You always think, you never act.

01:04:45.042 --> 01:04:48.504
What if we got these powers for a reason?
What if it's like some higher calling?

01:04:48.588 --> 01:04:50.923
A higher calling?
Like getting girls and making money?

01:04:51.007 --> 01:04:52.508
Is there any higher?

01:04:52.717 --> 01:04:55.052
You know what, Reed?
This is who we are.

01:04:55.636 --> 01:04:56.762
Accept it.

01:04:58.055 --> 01:05:00.349
Or better yet, enjoy it.

01:05:04.687 --> 01:05:08.524
Wait, Ben, slow down. He didn't mean it.

01:05:09.358 --> 01:05:11.402
You know Johnny.
He's always been a hothead.

01:05:11.485 --> 01:05:13.905
It ain't him. It's them!

01:05:15.489 --> 01:05:17.116
I can't live like this.

01:05:17.366 --> 01:05:19.744
Just give Reed a little more time.
You know how he works.

01:05:19.827 --> 01:05:22.246
Analysing every little step
before he takes one.

01:05:22.330 --> 01:05:25.041
- It's easy for you to be patient.
- No, it's not!

01:05:25.917 --> 01:05:28.753
I thought I was done waiting for Reed,
but I...

01:05:31.923 --> 01:05:34.425
- We're all in this together, Ben.
- Together?

01:05:35.551 --> 01:05:39.096
Susie, look at me.
You got no idea what I'd...

01:05:42.016 --> 01:05:43.935
What I'd give to be invisible.

01:05:59.784 --> 01:06:01.285
Thank you, gentlemen.

01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.997
I'm just gonna pick up a few things...

01:06:06.290 --> 01:06:07.750
for some friends.

01:06:25.309 --> 01:06:26.602
Perfect.

01:06:55.506 --> 01:06:56.966
That's not funny.

01:06:57.967 --> 01:06:59.594
This is Ben Grimm here.

01:06:59.677 --> 01:07:02.555
The first mook from Brooklyn
to go into outer space.

01:07:02.638 --> 01:07:04.348
So pay him some respect.

01:07:04.473 --> 01:07:06.559
Just give me the usual and I'm out.

01:07:06.642 --> 01:07:07.727
All right.

01:07:08.811 --> 01:07:10.980
- Make it a double.
- Make it a triple.

01:07:13.524 --> 01:07:16.319
- Put it on my tab, Ernie.
- All right, Alicia.

01:07:16.402 --> 01:07:17.653
Appreciate it.

01:07:18.154 --> 01:07:19.280
No problem.

01:07:24.994 --> 01:07:26.037
It's okay, Ben.

01:07:26.120 --> 01:07:28.539
If there's a God, he hates me.

01:07:28.623 --> 01:07:31.417
She is not so into hate.

01:07:33.377 --> 01:07:35.671
If you could see me,
you wouldn't be saying that.

01:07:35.755 --> 01:07:37.215
Then let me see you.

01:07:38.382 --> 01:07:39.550
Can I?

01:07:44.889 --> 01:07:46.098
- Careful.
- It's okay.

01:08:09.205 --> 01:08:10.539
So sad.

01:08:14.377 --> 01:08:18.506
You know,
being different isn't always a bad thing.

01:08:20.258 --> 01:08:23.553
Trust me. This ain't one of them times.

01:08:25.763 --> 01:08:27.765
Not if you don't want it to be.

01:08:29.225 --> 01:08:31.935
- All right, Ernie, I'm out of here.
- I'll take you.

01:08:32.019 --> 01:08:33.563
See you later, Benny.

01:08:40.861 --> 01:08:42.488
I'm Alicia, by the way.

01:08:47.618 --> 01:08:48.953
Thanks, Ernie.

01:08:58.462 --> 01:09:00.923
Reed got what he wanted.

01:09:01.506 --> 01:09:03.301
And everything he wanted...

01:09:04.468 --> 01:09:05.803
he took from me.

01:09:11.309 --> 01:09:14.478
Now it's time to take it back.

01:09:17.648 --> 01:09:21.694
But first,
I need to get rid of his bodyguard.

01:09:36.959 --> 01:09:38.336
This seat taken?

01:09:39.545 --> 01:09:41.255
What are you doing here?

01:09:42.590 --> 01:09:44.300
I was worried about you.

01:09:44.759 --> 01:09:47.345
You were worried about me?
That's sweet.

01:09:48.011 --> 01:09:50.389
Come on.
Let me buy you something to eat.

01:09:52.683 --> 01:09:54.936
Looks like you could use the company.

01:09:59.941 --> 01:10:01.025
Reed?

01:10:08.241 --> 01:10:10.910
- I was just resting my eyes.
- So I see.

01:10:12.370 --> 01:10:14.622
The new readouts look very promising.

01:10:14.997 --> 01:10:16.415
Not promising enough.

01:10:16.499 --> 01:10:18.209
When are the next tests?

01:10:19.418 --> 01:10:21.045
I've run out of plans.

01:10:22.797 --> 01:10:24.632
So I was thinking maybe...

01:10:27.051 --> 01:10:29.095
There's always me.

01:10:29.428 --> 01:10:31.722
No. It's too soon.

01:10:32.390 --> 01:10:34.475
- Reed?
- I should get back to work.

01:10:34.725 --> 01:10:37.228
- You need a break.
- Sue, not now, please.

01:10:37.603 --> 01:10:39.021
Come on. Let's go.

01:10:42.650 --> 01:10:44.235
Remember our first date here?

01:10:45.570 --> 01:10:46.821
God, I was nervous.

01:10:47.405 --> 01:10:51.242
You know, I bribed the projectionist $10
to keep the place open late.

01:10:51.325 --> 01:10:53.953
Really? I gave him $20.

01:10:54.579 --> 01:10:55.621
- No.
- Yeah.

01:10:55.955 --> 01:10:57.206
- No way.
- Yeah.

01:10:59.875 --> 01:11:01.627
I didn't want that night to end.

01:11:05.923 --> 01:11:08.050
You were right. It wasn't complicated.

01:11:08.885 --> 01:11:10.636
I just wasn't ready to...

01:11:11.929 --> 01:11:14.181
You always talked about
how you kind of liked the man...

01:11:14.265 --> 01:11:16.183
who would approach you,
speak his mind.

01:11:16.517 --> 01:11:18.895
One who wasn't afraid
to tell you exactly what he wanted.

01:11:19.186 --> 01:11:20.396
I did.

01:11:21.689 --> 01:11:23.357
But I wanted you to be that man.

01:11:23.983 --> 01:11:25.651
Well, why didn't you say something?

01:11:26.068 --> 01:11:28.988
Reed, I'm saying it now.

01:11:40.291 --> 01:11:41.417
Excuse me.

01:11:46.088 --> 01:11:47.632
I know it's not easy.

01:11:48.549 --> 01:11:51.219
Life hasn't changed that much for Reed,
Sue, or Johnny.

01:11:51.302 --> 01:11:54.055
At least they can still go out in public.
But for you...

01:11:54.138 --> 01:11:56.891
If you're trying to cheer me up,
you're doing a hell of a job.

01:11:56.974 --> 01:11:58.392
You know what I mean, Scarface?

01:11:58.476 --> 01:12:01.312
I'm just saying I know what it's like
to lose something that you love...

01:12:01.395 --> 01:12:03.397
to see it slip away
and know it's never coming back.

01:12:03.481 --> 01:12:04.649
Look.

01:12:05.358 --> 01:12:07.610
Reed is gonna fix me up, okay?

01:12:09.403 --> 01:12:11.572
For your sake I hope you're right.

01:12:12.073 --> 01:12:13.616
Look, he's a brilliant man.

01:12:13.699 --> 01:12:16.827
We should all trust
that he's working as hard as he can.

01:12:17.370 --> 01:12:18.579
You're his best friend.

01:12:18.663 --> 01:12:21.874
So what possible reason could he have
for taking his time?

01:12:24.752 --> 01:12:27.797
I mean, other than spending
more time with Sue.

01:12:31.467 --> 01:12:34.762
- Wow, I had no idea.
- It's true.

01:12:38.599 --> 01:12:39.767
Yeah.

01:12:40.393 --> 01:12:42.270
I have that effect on people.

01:12:43.854 --> 01:12:44.981
Ben.

01:12:47.024 --> 01:12:49.235
So you remember my name now, do you?

01:12:50.361 --> 01:12:53.739
Do you also remember
what you swore to do...

01:12:53.823 --> 01:12:55.700
with every breath in your body?

01:12:55.783 --> 01:12:57.785
We're working as hard as we can.

01:12:58.244 --> 01:13:00.329
Yeah. I can tell.

01:13:02.164 --> 01:13:04.208
- Victor was right.
- Victor?

01:13:05.042 --> 01:13:08.296
Ben, I don't know if this thing
will change us back or make us worse.

01:13:08.379 --> 01:13:10.214
I need you to be patient
for a little while longer.

01:13:10.298 --> 01:13:11.382
Reed, look at me!

01:13:11.465 --> 01:13:14.135
I am looking.
That's why I can't make a mistake.

01:13:14.218 --> 01:13:16.888
I've gotta get it right and it's not right yet!
We need to test it!

01:13:16.971 --> 01:13:20.057
I spent my whole life protecting you,
and for what?

01:13:20.141 --> 01:13:22.268
So you can play Twister
with your girlfriend...

01:13:22.351 --> 01:13:24.353
while I'm the freak of the week?

01:13:25.479 --> 01:13:26.689
Ben, stop it!

01:13:27.273 --> 01:13:30.109
- You stay out of this, Susie!
- Stop it, or I will.

01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:33.195
Get off me, rubber boy!

01:13:33.863 --> 01:13:35.489
You guys, quit it.

01:13:52.089 --> 01:13:53.883
Calm down!

01:14:08.397 --> 01:14:11.567
Good thing you're flexible enough
to watch your own back.

01:14:19.533 --> 01:14:21.619
'Cause I ain't doing it no more.

01:14:25.206 --> 01:14:26.874
You two are on your own.

01:14:38.886 --> 01:14:40.388
Look what the marketing guys gave me.

01:14:40.471 --> 01:14:42.682
Look, check it out, listen.
You're gonna love this.

01:14:42.765 --> 01:14:45.184
<i>It's clobbering time!</i>

01:14:45.393 --> 01:14:46.852
It's catchy, right?

01:14:48.854 --> 01:14:50.189
Isn't that great?

01:14:53.109 --> 01:14:54.902
That was the prototype.

01:15:01.909 --> 01:15:05.079
- Johnny, have you seen Ben?
- Yeah, Sunshine just left.

01:15:05.162 --> 01:15:07.873
Look, Sue, I'm sorry.
I can't stand this freak show.

01:15:07.957 --> 01:15:11.252
- I gotta get back to the real world.
- You're calling that the real world?

01:15:11.335 --> 01:15:14.380
Sue, stop. You're not Mum.
Don't talk to me like I'm a little boy, okay?

01:15:14.463 --> 01:15:16.799
Maybe I would
if you stopped acting like one.

01:15:16.883 --> 01:15:19.802
Do you even hear yourself?
Who do you think you are?

01:15:19.886 --> 01:15:22.763
Why is everyone on my ass?
If you guys are jealous, that's fine.

01:15:22.847 --> 01:15:24.432
I didn't expect it
to come from you, though.

01:15:24.515 --> 01:15:27.226
You really think those people out there
care about you?

01:15:27.310 --> 01:15:28.936
You're just a fad to them, Johnny!

01:15:29.020 --> 01:15:32.273
Let's try something new.
You live your life, I'll live mine.

01:15:34.358 --> 01:15:35.484
Sound good?

01:15:37.862 --> 01:15:40.489
And just for the record, they love me!

01:16:25.576 --> 01:16:27.370
Oh, God. Reed.

01:17:08.744 --> 01:17:10.871
Oh, my God, Reed. What did you do?

01:17:11.205 --> 01:17:13.207
- I can make it work.
- No!

01:17:13.291 --> 01:17:17.044
I need more power to control the storm.

01:17:17.128 --> 01:17:18.337
More power?

01:17:18.421 --> 01:17:20.882
<i>- You need a doctor. Come with me.
- Sue.</i>

01:17:21.799 --> 01:17:23.634
<i>- One more try...
- You need to rest.</i>

01:17:23.718 --> 01:17:27.179
Leonard, bring me our lab rat.

01:17:31.726 --> 01:17:33.811
Ben. Come in.

01:17:35.438 --> 01:17:37.565
What is this? Where's Reed?

01:17:37.648 --> 01:17:40.151
Where do you think? With Sue.

01:17:41.277 --> 01:17:43.321
I'll take it from here, Leonard.

01:17:44.488 --> 01:17:45.573
Yes, sir.

01:17:50.661 --> 01:17:52.246
What do you want, Vic?

01:17:52.455 --> 01:17:53.623
To help you.

01:17:54.749 --> 01:17:57.418
The machine is ready.

01:17:57.877 --> 01:17:59.253
But Reed said it wouldn't...

01:17:59.337 --> 01:18:01.672
He also said we'd avoid
that storm in space...

01:18:01.756 --> 01:18:03.925
but we all know how that turned out.

01:18:04.342 --> 01:18:08.304
He couldn't generate enough power
for the machine to reach critical mass.

01:18:08.554 --> 01:18:11.807
Yet another mistake for Mr. Fantastic.

01:18:12.475 --> 01:18:14.560
- And you can?
- Yes.

01:18:18.731 --> 01:18:19.815
Tell me...

01:18:21.651 --> 01:18:23.861
do you want to be Ben Grimm again?

01:20:09.091 --> 01:20:10.218
Thank you.

01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:13.888
Vic?

01:20:28.778 --> 01:20:30.071
Vic, it worked.

01:20:37.578 --> 01:20:40.373
Everyone thought I was safe
behind those shields.

01:20:43.251 --> 01:20:44.585
Oh, my God.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:48.589
The machine worked for me.
It can work for you, too!

01:20:48.673 --> 01:20:51.801
It did, Ben. It worked perfectly.

01:20:54.095 --> 01:20:57.014
- You planned this.
- I've always wanted power.

01:20:57.640 --> 01:21:01.477
Now I have an unlimited supply.

01:21:01.978 --> 01:21:03.896
And no Thing to stand in your way.

01:21:03.980 --> 01:21:05.565
Take a good look, Ben.

01:21:05.898 --> 01:21:09.569
This is what a man looks like
who embraces his destiny.

01:21:14.448 --> 01:21:16.742
One down, three to go.

01:21:17.660 --> 01:21:18.744
Vic?

01:21:20.037 --> 01:21:21.330
Right on cue.

01:21:22.164 --> 01:21:23.291
Ben?

01:21:24.750 --> 01:21:26.878
- What did you do?
- Exactly what I said I would.

01:21:26.961 --> 01:21:30.172
I built a better, stronger being.

01:21:31.048 --> 01:21:33.718
And outsmarted the great Reed Richards.

01:21:33.801 --> 01:21:37.138
If you've exposed yourself to the storm,
you're endangering your life.

01:21:37.221 --> 01:21:39.974
- You need help.
- You always know best.

01:21:42.101 --> 01:21:45.187
So tell me, what happens
when you superheat rubber?

01:22:08.002 --> 01:22:09.962
No!

01:22:19.805 --> 01:22:22.516
Mr. Von Doom, are you okay?

01:22:23.434 --> 01:22:24.685
Never better, Jimmy.

01:22:37.031 --> 01:22:40.159
Why the long face? Let's talk in my office.

01:23:00.596 --> 01:23:01.722
Ben.

01:23:04.392 --> 01:23:05.601
Sue!

01:23:05.685 --> 01:23:07.645
Johnny, the machine worked!

01:23:08.229 --> 01:23:10.022
Give me a hand. Come on.

01:23:12.525 --> 01:23:13.818
Get his arm.

01:23:16.195 --> 01:23:18.447
You all right, Ben? Put him on the step.

01:23:18.531 --> 01:23:21.701
What happened, big guy?
I leave you for five minutes...

01:23:22.702 --> 01:23:23.869
The machine.

01:23:24.370 --> 01:23:28.207
Vic used it on himself.
He was affected by the cloud like us.

01:23:28.291 --> 01:23:30.960
- Where's Reed?
- Vic must have taken him.

01:23:35.798 --> 01:23:38.926
Dr. Richards,
allow me to begin your lesson.

01:23:39.427 --> 01:23:41.262
Chemistry 101.

01:23:42.722 --> 01:23:46.225
What happens to rubber
when it's supercooled?

01:23:51.147 --> 01:23:52.481
Give up?

01:23:55.067 --> 01:23:56.819
That's not like you, Reed.

01:24:03.492 --> 01:24:06.329
After all, we're both doctors.

01:24:08.539 --> 01:24:09.832
Painful?

01:24:10.583 --> 01:24:12.668
You don't know the meaning of the word.

01:24:20.843 --> 01:24:23.721
Just a little something
from our defence contracts.

01:24:27.934 --> 01:24:31.437
Let's check in on the rest of the family,
shall we?

01:24:38.236 --> 01:24:39.737
We gotta get out of here!

01:24:42.782 --> 01:24:45.493
Wait a minute. I got an idea!

01:24:45.952 --> 01:24:48.412
- Don't even think about it.
- Never do.

01:24:48.496 --> 01:24:51.040
What are you doing? Johnny, no!

01:24:57.088 --> 01:25:00.299
Come on, flame on!

01:25:13.145 --> 01:25:14.814
We have to help Reed.

01:25:14.897 --> 01:25:17.942
It's too dangerous for you now.
You have to stay here.

01:25:20.152 --> 01:25:21.654
What did I do?

01:25:58.733 --> 01:26:00.234
Come on, think!

01:26:22.715 --> 01:26:25.301
Two down, two to go.

01:26:38.898 --> 01:26:40.149
Sue.

01:26:42.443 --> 01:26:45.196
- What has he done to you?
- How romantic.

01:26:47.823 --> 01:26:49.116
Victor, please.

01:26:50.576 --> 01:26:51.953
Call me Doom.

01:26:52.995 --> 01:26:56.874
The machine works. It worked on Ben,
it can work on you. We can turn you back.

01:26:56.958 --> 01:27:01.087
Do you really think fate turned us
into gods so we could refuse these gifts?

01:27:01.170 --> 01:27:04.090
Victor, you always thought
you were a god. Now back off.

01:27:04.173 --> 01:27:06.259
Susan, let's not fight.

01:27:06.342 --> 01:27:07.635
No. Let's.

01:27:12.723 --> 01:27:14.934
Susan, you're fired!

01:27:25.695 --> 01:27:27.113
Marco.

01:27:28.489 --> 01:27:29.699
Polo.

01:27:43.254 --> 01:27:45.798
Did you say goodbye
to your brother Johnny?

01:27:50.052 --> 01:27:52.305
It's time to end this!

01:27:54.557 --> 01:27:57.393
No, Vic. It's clobbering time.

01:28:06.402 --> 01:28:08.571
Damn, I've been waiting to do that.

01:28:09.405 --> 01:28:10.990
Susie, you okay?

01:28:12.283 --> 01:28:14.076
Victor ain't that bad, huh?

01:28:16.370 --> 01:28:18.956
"He's just a little larger than life," right?

01:28:19.498 --> 01:28:22.126
Maybe next time
you'll listen to me before...

01:28:22.752 --> 01:28:23.836
Ben!

01:29:14.554 --> 01:29:16.514
- Sorry, ladies.
- Stop the car!

01:29:16.597 --> 01:29:19.934
Pull over. Hit the brakes!

01:29:28.568 --> 01:29:30.069
<i>This is the police.</i>

01:29:30.570 --> 01:29:34.365
<i>Put your hands up
and step down from the vehicle!</i>

01:29:37.827 --> 01:29:39.078
Take him out!

01:29:45.251 --> 01:29:47.795
Ladies, I'm gonna need
to borrow your car.

01:29:47.879 --> 01:29:50.923
- The transmission sticks.
- Not gonna be a problem.

01:30:28.628 --> 01:30:30.630
I can't let you do that!

01:30:31.797 --> 01:30:32.965
Reed?

01:30:35.551 --> 01:30:37.178
I'll be right with you.

01:30:44.310 --> 01:30:45.645
Hello, Susan.

01:30:47.563 --> 01:30:49.607
You three are pathetic.

01:30:58.074 --> 01:30:59.325
You missed me.

01:31:02.453 --> 01:31:04.163
Had a little relapse, huh?

01:31:05.623 --> 01:31:08.167
- Welcome back.
- This is gonna be fun.

01:31:30.523 --> 01:31:32.191
I can't hold it!

01:31:44.537 --> 01:31:46.080
Johnny, supernova!

01:31:46.163 --> 01:31:47.665
I thought we agreed that was bad.

01:31:47.748 --> 01:31:48.791
Now!

01:31:50.793 --> 01:31:52.086
- Ben!
- Gotcha.

01:32:00.803 --> 01:32:03.055
Sue! Think you can contain it?

01:32:13.941 --> 01:32:15.359
Flame on, kid.

01:32:40.009 --> 01:32:43.137
Is that the best you can do?

01:32:43.221 --> 01:32:45.556
Time for your lesson. Chem 101.

01:32:45.765 --> 01:32:48.351
What happens
when you rapidly cool hot metal?

01:32:49.769 --> 01:32:50.937
Ben!

01:33:39.944 --> 01:33:41.654
You done good, kid.

01:33:43.322 --> 01:33:44.448
Come on.

01:33:46.242 --> 01:33:47.577
Sue, you okay?

01:33:48.035 --> 01:33:49.161
Yeah.

01:33:57.169 --> 01:33:58.671
Man, I love this job.

01:34:00.423 --> 01:34:01.632
Job, huh?

01:34:02.592 --> 01:34:04.594
Well, we do have the suits.

01:34:26.407 --> 01:34:27.658
Ladies, your drinks.

01:34:27.742 --> 01:34:30.119
- I don't think we need another.
- Just one more.

01:34:30.203 --> 01:34:33.039
Thank you, thank you so much. Cheers!

01:34:35.708 --> 01:34:38.669
I need names and shots.

01:34:38.794 --> 01:34:39.962
Bartender!

01:34:40.421 --> 01:34:42.965
They're custom-made, 36 EEEE.

01:34:43.049 --> 01:34:45.927
Well, look. I've been crunching
the numbers on the machine.

01:34:46.010 --> 01:34:47.803
And I think if I can rework
the power settings...

01:34:47.887 --> 01:34:50.723
Forget about it, egghead. I'm good as is.

01:34:50.806 --> 01:34:52.391
Better than good, baby.

01:34:54.101 --> 01:34:56.896
You just need to work on your touch.

01:34:57.688 --> 01:34:59.398
I like the sound of that.

01:35:02.235 --> 01:35:04.946
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- Sure.

01:35:09.200 --> 01:35:10.243
Thanks.

01:35:16.249 --> 01:35:18.960
I found a broken gasket from space.

01:35:20.211 --> 01:35:21.462
A gasket?

01:35:21.546 --> 01:35:25.091
- Reed, come on, we're at a party.
- And if one of us were to wear it...

01:35:34.809 --> 01:35:36.143
No more thinking.

01:35:36.727 --> 01:35:38.479
No more variables.

01:35:41.065 --> 01:35:42.275
Sue Storm...

01:35:43.359 --> 01:35:44.735
will you marry me?

01:35:56.080 --> 01:36:00.167
Sue, you kind of need to say something.

01:36:00.835 --> 01:36:01.961
Yes.

01:36:12.221 --> 01:36:15.683
That's my nose, genius. These are my lips.

01:36:21.606 --> 01:36:23.024
She's kissing him.

01:36:23.399 --> 01:36:25.109
That's so cute.

About time, you guys.

01:36:29.322 --> 01:36:31.449
No more wisecracks about the way I look.

01:36:33.951 --> 01:36:35.661
Call me Mr. Sensitivity.

01:36:37.079 --> 01:36:40.750
Okay. Wide load coming through.
Everybody move, he's huge.

01:36:41.959 --> 01:36:44.295
- Come here, Mr. Sensitive.
- Flame on.

01:36:48.090 --> 01:36:49.217
Showoff!

01:37:12.990 --> 01:37:14.492
How long will it be?

01:37:14.617 --> 01:37:16.327
Should be about 12 days.
