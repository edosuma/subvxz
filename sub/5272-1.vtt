WEBVTT

00:59.392 --> 01:01.593
Yeah, I got a fire at the Quick Stop.

01:01.594 --> 01:03.356
Yeah.

01:53.079 --> 01:56.070
Terrorists?

02:01.087 --> 02:04.920
I left the coffee pot on again, didn't I?

02:07.093 --> 02:08.926
Shit!

02:08.928 --> 02:10.929
Now where am I gonna bring chicks to fuck

02:10.930 --> 02:14.024
when my mom's home?

03:06.152 --> 03:09.087
So, ready for your big last day?

03:09.088 --> 03:10.255
I am.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.057
When do you and your old lady head down to Florida?

03:12.058 --> 03:13.258
Tomorrow morning.

03:13.259 --> 03:14.426
Car's all packed up.

03:14.427 --> 03:15.427
You gonna do anything crazy

03:15.428 --> 03:17.562
before you leave New Jersey forever?

03:17.563 --> 03:18.563
How long have you known me?

03:18.564 --> 03:20.265
If I were you, I'd spray-paint "eat pussy"

03:20.266 --> 03:22.601
across the side of the building in huge letters.

03:22.602 --> 03:24.436
Why?

03:24.437 --> 03:26.204
Let 'em know you were there, man.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.939
I'd rather let them know I'm not an asshole.

03:27.940 --> 03:29.474
Too late for that.

03:29.475 --> 03:32.244
I'm really gonna miss you, man.

04:21.127 --> 04:23.128
I can't believe they haven't
done anything with it yet.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.297
The Lord did something with it.

04:25.298 --> 04:27.799
He smited that hellhole.

04:27.800 --> 04:29.134
Listen to you.

04:29.135 --> 04:30.135
Do you mean to tell me

04:30.136 --> 04:31.636
you don't miss that place at all?

04:31.637 --> 04:33.305
God, no.

04:33.306 --> 04:35.637
Do you?

04:37.977 --> 04:39.478
Of course not.

06:25.618 --> 06:27.586
Get the fuck out of here!

06:30.756 --> 06:33.959
You know, sometimes I wish
I did a little more with my life

06:33.960 --> 06:37.588
instead of hanging out in front
of places selling weed and shit.

06:38.130 --> 06:40.966
Like, maybe be an animal doctor.

06:40.967 --> 06:42.467
Why not me?

06:42.468 --> 06:45.300
I like seals and shit.

06:45.805 --> 06:48.306
Or maybe an astronaut.

06:48.307 --> 06:50.075
Yeah.

06:50.076 --> 06:52.911
Like, be the first motherfucker to see a new galaxy

06:52.912 --> 06:57.349
or find a new alien life-form...

06:57.350 --> 06:59.249
and fuck it.

06:59.785 --> 07:03.054
And people'd be like, "There he goes.

07:03.055 --> 07:06.825
Homeboy fucked a Martian once."

07:06.826 --> 07:08.927
Holy shit.

07:08.928 --> 07:10.595
Our first customer since our triumphant return.

07:10.596 --> 07:11.596
Act cool.

07:11.597 --> 07:14.224
Hold on.

07:16.969 --> 07:18.436
Yeah, you guys holdin'?

07:18.437 --> 07:21.306
Shit, everything but coke, heroin, and your cock.

07:21.307 --> 07:23.074
What?

07:23.075 --> 07:24.376
How about a nickel bag, man?

07:24.377 --> 07:26.912
Oh, fifteen bucks, little man.

07:26.913 --> 07:28.880
Put that shit in my hand.

07:28.880 --> 07:31.750
Nong, nong, nagga-nagga-nong-nong.

07:31.750 --> 07:34.242
He likes to sing.

07:37.623 --> 07:40.292
So, uh, I haven't seen you guys in a while, man.

07:40.293 --> 07:41.426
Where you been all this time?

07:41.427 --> 07:43.295
Me and Silent Bob finally bought a car,

07:43.296 --> 07:44.796
we're cruising down to the Boardwalk...

07:44.797 --> 07:46.598
fucking Middletown cop pulls us over

07:46.599 --> 07:48.233
for suspicion of mischief.

07:48.234 --> 07:49.534
What the fuck does that mean?

07:49.535 --> 07:52.604
We were driving around with a deployed airbag.

07:52.605 --> 07:54.072
The cops pull us over.

07:54.073 --> 07:56.341
They find two pounds of Jamaican lambswool.

07:56.342 --> 07:58.243
Prosecutor wants to put us away for a dime,

07:58.244 --> 08:00.545
but the judge gives us rehab instead.

08:00.546 --> 08:01.546
Shit, rehab?

08:01.547 --> 08:02.314
Yup-yup.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.448
How long were you in?

08:03.449 --> 08:04.449
Six months, sir.

08:04.450 --> 08:06.418
We got six months and two days on the wagon

08:06.419 --> 08:08.086
as a good friend of Bill W.'s.

08:08.087 --> 08:10.088
Check it out.

08:10.089 --> 08:12.090
Just got it two days ago, before we got out.

08:12.090 --> 08:13.725
Yeah, but if you're holding all the time,

08:13.726 --> 08:16.061
aren't you gonna be tempted to get high?

08:16.062 --> 08:19.963
Oh, not with the power of Christ on my side, sir.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.734
Is that a fuckin' Bible?

08:22.735 --> 08:25.236
Hey, hey, the Holy fuckin' Bible, son!

08:25.237 --> 08:27.472
What the fuck kind of songbird Jesus-freak dealer

08:27.473 --> 08:28.807
did you bring me to?

08:28.808 --> 08:30.809
I like them, man. They're funny.

08:30.810 --> 08:32.611
They're fuckin' stupid.

08:32.611 --> 08:33.979
You should read your Bible, sirs.

08:33.980 --> 08:37.015
You'll find all types of weird shit in there.

08:37.015 --> 08:39.881
Like, did you know Jesus was a Jew?

08:40.419 --> 08:42.510
Yeah.

08:45.825 --> 08:47.592
I need two Egga-Mooby Muffins,

08:47.593 --> 08:48.893
and we're almost out of hash browns.

08:48.894 --> 08:50.486
Hold on.

08:50.963 --> 08:52.987
Now, Randal!

08:58.938 --> 09:00.472
What are you writing over there, anyway,

09:00.473 --> 09:01.473
your memoirs?

09:01.474 --> 09:02.841
I'm battling

09:02.842 --> 09:05.243
this jackass on his blog's message board.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.277
About what?

09:06.278 --> 09:08.713
On how he's got too much free time and no life.

09:08.714 --> 09:10.582
So does the guy who's flaming him on his Web site.

09:10.583 --> 09:12.584
I can't help it. The guy pisses me off.

09:12.585 --> 09:14.019
It's this fuck in a wheelchair

09:14.020 --> 09:15.887
that's always preying on everyone's sympathies,

09:15.888 --> 09:19.157
writing these long diatribes
about how he'll never walk again

09:19.158 --> 09:21.493
and how walkers should appreciate the blessings

09:21.494 --> 09:23.294
of their functioning legs.

09:23.295 --> 09:24.496
That diatribe, as you call it,

09:24.497 --> 09:25.664
sounds like some poor crippled guy

09:25.665 --> 09:27.365
pouring out his heart and feelings.

09:27.366 --> 09:28.667
Oh, fuck him, man.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.335
Trying to guilt me into walking around more

09:30.336 --> 09:32.003
because he's all gimped out?

09:32.004 --> 09:33.705
What kind of mind-fuck is that shit?

09:33.706 --> 09:35.440
So I've been getting into it with him,

09:35.440 --> 09:38.410
throwing it back in his stupid crippy-boy face

09:38.410 --> 09:40.011
about how I love to just sit around

09:40.012 --> 09:43.448
and how I'd rather drive to
the end of the block than walk.

09:43.449 --> 09:45.183
The guy's in a wheelchair.

09:45.184 --> 09:47.052
Yeah. That's why I called him crippy-boy.

09:47.053 --> 09:48.620
Have a good one.

09:48.620 --> 09:51.555
You fuckin' freak.

09:53.726 --> 09:56.394
I'm not even gonna point out the irony here.

09:56.395 --> 09:57.896
What's the matter with you?

09:57.897 --> 09:59.064
What'd I do now?

09:59.065 --> 10:00.231
There's a crippled guy who found a way

10:00.232 --> 10:02.400
to reach out to a world he feels isolated from,

10:02.400 --> 10:04.569
and you somehow found a way to take issue with him.

10:04.570 --> 10:06.237
Sure, take his side.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.405
Have you become so embittered

10:07.406 --> 10:10.075
that you now feel the need
to attack the handicapped?

10:10.076 --> 10:11.242
What handicap?

10:11.243 --> 10:12.744
The guy's just in a wheelchair.

10:12.745 --> 10:15.080
It's not like he's Anne Frank or something.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.748
Anne Frank?

10:16.749 --> 10:19.217
Yeah, Anne Frank, the chick that was all...

10:19.752 --> 10:21.419
...till the miracle worker showed up

10:21.420 --> 10:23.121
and knocked some smarts into her.

10:23.122 --> 10:24.122
You're talking

10:24.123 --> 10:25.457
about Helen Keller.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.791
No, I'm not. I'm talking about Anne Frank.

10:26.792 --> 10:27.959
She was deaf, dumb and blind.

10:27.960 --> 10:28.960
No, she wasn't.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.129
Helen Keller was deaf, dumb and blind.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.297
Are you sure?

10:32.298 --> 10:33.465
Yup.

10:33.466 --> 10:35.633
Then who the fuck's Anne Frank?

10:35.634 --> 10:37.135
Anne Frank's the little Jewish girl

10:37.136 --> 10:38.636
who hid from the Nazis

10:38.637 --> 10:40.305
in a secret room with her family.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.306
She wrote a diary.

10:41.307 --> 10:42.373
Oh, yeah.

10:42.374 --> 10:44.476
Well, then, I guess this
guy is like Anne Frank,

10:44.477 --> 10:46.978
what with the diary, you know?

10:46.979 --> 10:51.438
No, he's like Helen Keller
with the handicap, you jerk!

10:51.984 --> 10:53.585
You always got to be right, don't you?

10:53.586 --> 10:55.420
You Nazi douche bag.

10:55.420 --> 10:57.088
What? What do you want?

10:57.089 --> 11:00.091
No, we don't serve Cow Tippers in the morning.

11:00.092 --> 11:03.686
Freedom Toast is a possibility.

11:16.876 --> 11:19.970
Oh, we totally do.

11:22.515 --> 11:24.539
All right, that'll be $12.64.

11:40.733 --> 11:44.566
Avert your eyes, you perv.

11:45.104 --> 11:46.304
That's not very hygienic.

11:46.305 --> 11:48.670
That's all I'm gonna tell you.

11:51.577 --> 11:52.744
Emma, are you like this

11:52.745 --> 11:55.304
'cause you have an unnaturally large clit?

11:57.683 --> 11:59.083
You just had to tell him, didn't you?

11:59.084 --> 12:00.418
It kind of came out one day.

12:00.419 --> 12:01.553
He says it's so big,

12:01.554 --> 12:02.754
it's almost like a little cock...

12:02.755 --> 12:04.923
which says all kinds of weird things about him

12:04.924 --> 12:06.491
that I don't even want to think about.

12:06.492 --> 12:07.592
You wouldn't want to be with a girl

12:07.593 --> 12:08.827
with an oversized clit?

12:08.828 --> 12:12.661
No, 'cause the next stop is
a guy with an undersized dick.

12:33.953 --> 12:36.387
You're a little hard.

12:36.388 --> 12:37.755
'Cause you're a little close to me.

12:37.756 --> 12:39.224
I can pull back, if you want.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.360
Can we pull back into our
own apartment in Florida again?

12:42.360 --> 12:44.295
Really? Goddamn it, Dante.

12:44.296 --> 12:45.463
How many times are we gonna have

12:45.464 --> 12:47.232
this fucking conversation?

12:47.233 --> 12:49.901
There is no point in getting an apartment anymore.

12:49.902 --> 12:51.569
My mother has pretty much told us

12:51.570 --> 12:53.571
that she's gonna get us a house as a wedding gift.

12:53.572 --> 12:55.073
Your parents' generosity

12:55.074 --> 12:57.308
just makes me a little uncomfortable, Em.

12:57.309 --> 12:58.843
They're giving us a house.

12:58.844 --> 13:01.346
Your dad's giving me one of his car washes to run.

13:01.347 --> 13:02.680
It just feels weird.

13:02.680 --> 13:05.583
Babe, it just feels weird because you're so used

13:05.584 --> 13:07.485
to life shitting on you all the time.

13:07.486 --> 13:09.520
What the fuck does that mean?

13:09.520 --> 13:11.256
All I'm saying is that suddenly,

13:11.257 --> 13:12.924
you have a woman that loves you,

13:12.925 --> 13:14.893
a new job opportunity

13:14.894 --> 13:18.192
and a fantastic life to look forward to, right?

13:18.730 --> 13:21.995
You got to face it, tiger: you hit the jackpot.

13:26.739 --> 13:29.730
What's up?

13:32.177 --> 13:33.378
Something wrong?

13:33.379 --> 13:34.379
Nope.

13:34.380 --> 13:35.914
Just saw you guys talking.

13:35.915 --> 13:37.515
Thought I'd come out here and join you.

13:37.516 --> 13:38.516
God, it must be nice to have a job

13:38.517 --> 13:40.184
with so much downtime.

13:40.185 --> 13:41.753
Downtime's important.

13:41.754 --> 13:43.821
If I had to deal with all
the fucking mouth-breathers

13:43.822 --> 13:45.356
nonstop, without a break,

13:45.357 --> 13:47.324
I'd put my head in the deep fryer.

13:48.360 --> 13:50.261
Balls, too.

13:50.262 --> 13:51.262
Do you really want

13:51.263 --> 13:53.431
to sit here and watch me
and my fiancé make out?

13:53.432 --> 13:55.166
- Are you that much of a loser?
- Not really.

13:55.167 --> 13:57.035
I was actually gonna ask you two to knock it off

13:57.036 --> 13:58.736
while I was out here.

13:58.737 --> 14:00.038
I don't fucking understand why you can't be happy

14:00.039 --> 14:01.539
for your best friend.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.871
He finally found a woman who loves him.

14:04.410 --> 14:06.044
Like you even register as a chick to me.

14:06.045 --> 14:07.745
You might as well be a dude.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.213
Really?

14:09.214 --> 14:11.149
Yeah. You're my best friend's girlfriend.

14:11.150 --> 14:13.051
You became persona non-nookie to me

14:13.052 --> 14:15.520
the moment he started diddling your pooter.

14:15.520 --> 14:17.121
So thinking of me in terms of being a girl

14:17.122 --> 14:18.489
kind of creeps you out, does it?

14:18.490 --> 14:21.025
Sweetheart, I don't think
of you in terms of being a girl.

14:21.026 --> 14:24.359
I don't think of you in any way...

14:24.863 --> 14:27.298
Oh, that was just wrong.

14:27.299 --> 14:28.733
If you don't get the fuck out of here

14:28.734 --> 14:31.069
so that I can spend some quality time with my man,

14:31.070 --> 14:32.971
next, I'm gonna show you my pooter.

14:32.972 --> 14:35.440
Why would you want to do something like that?

14:35.440 --> 14:37.976
All right, all right, I'm leaving!

14:37.977 --> 14:39.466
Jesus!

14:43.115 --> 14:44.382
What'd you do that for?

14:44.383 --> 14:46.351
You realize he just thinks you're trying

14:46.352 --> 14:48.453
to get him into a three-way with us now, don't you?

14:48.454 --> 14:50.254
Yeah, right. With Graves?

14:50.255 --> 14:52.857
That man's a total fucking Lloyd,
like most Jersey guys.

14:52.858 --> 14:54.058
Hey!

14:54.059 --> 14:56.027
You talk tough, but when
we're crossing the state line,

14:56.028 --> 14:57.528
I bet you get all sentimental for Jersey

14:57.529 --> 14:59.030
and squirt a few tears.

14:59.030 --> 15:00.565
Yeah, tears of joy, maybe.

15:00.566 --> 15:01.632
Jersey sucks,

15:01.633 --> 15:03.134
and we are surrounded by morons.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.370
On that note, I'm gonna go.

15:05.370 --> 15:06.871
Whoa, whoa, whoa! You're leaving?

15:06.872 --> 15:08.673
Yeah, I've got a ton of stuff to do

15:08.674 --> 15:10.903
before we leave in the morning, but I love you.

15:11.443 --> 15:12.877
I love you, too.

15:12.878 --> 15:15.209
Bye.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.055
Dude, I'm pretty sure your old lady wants

15:24.056 --> 15:27.616
to get you and me together in a three-way.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.051
Ow.

15:53.052 --> 15:54.849
Dude, how old are you?

15:55.720 --> 15:57.722
You know I'm nineteen, Randal.

15:57.723 --> 16:00.391
You wouldn't work for me last week, remember?

16:00.392 --> 16:02.727
'Cause you said working on my birthday

16:02.728 --> 16:05.355
would help me build character.

16:06.398 --> 16:08.900
Well, at least you spelled "cock" right this time.

16:08.900 --> 16:10.902
Why the fuck are you still getting rides

16:10.903 --> 16:12.570
from your mother?

16:12.570 --> 16:13.738
And even worse,

16:13.739 --> 16:15.740
what the fuck are you kissing her good-bye for?

16:15.740 --> 16:17.909
What is she, your fuckin' prom date?

16:17.910 --> 16:19.577
You're not gonna bother me today, Randal.

16:19.578 --> 16:20.745
I'm in too good a mood.

16:20.746 --> 16:22.747
Because your mom slipped you the tongue?

16:22.748 --> 16:27.085
No, because I just read
online that there's gonna be

16:27.086 --> 16:29.187
a live-action Transformers movie.

16:29.188 --> 16:30.354
And?

16:30.355 --> 16:33.024
Well... I mean, as you know,

16:33.025 --> 16:35.026
my online handle is Optimus Prime.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.028
I know that. I wish I didn't.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.531
Well, so not only is it awesome

16:40.532 --> 16:43.868
that there's gonna be a
live-action Transformers movie,

16:43.869 --> 16:47.038
but I'm, like, positioned or whatever

16:47.039 --> 16:51.876
with the best possible
Net handle and e-mail address

16:51.877 --> 16:53.544
for when the movie comes out.

16:53.545 --> 16:56.714
Oh, you're gonna be rolling in the pussy, man.

16:56.715 --> 16:58.449
Don't be gross.

16:58.450 --> 16:59.884
Says the guy who was just playing

16:59.885 --> 17:01.819
tonsil hockey with his mother.

17:01.820 --> 17:03.154
Mr. Dante!

17:03.155 --> 17:07.021
Leave Elias alone, Randal!

17:08.227 --> 17:10.523
Don't look at his wee-wee.

17:11.363 --> 17:13.164
Dude, the Transformers sucked.

17:13.165 --> 17:14.397
Oh, no, they didn't.

17:14.398 --> 17:16.263
They were more than meets the eye.

17:17.136 --> 17:19.069
They could beat the pants
off Ranger Danger any day.

17:19.069 --> 17:21.172
Yeah. I'll lose sleep
wondering whether you're right

17:21.173 --> 17:22.640
- about that or not.
- Ow.

17:22.640 --> 17:25.076
I thought you weren't even
allowed to watch a lot of TV

17:25.077 --> 17:26.911
in your house 'cause you're all Christian and shit.

17:26.912 --> 17:29.213
Well, as it turns out, cars and trucks

17:29.214 --> 17:31.015
that turn into...

17:31.016 --> 17:35.119
robots aren't really that blasphemous,

17:35.120 --> 17:37.121
because my pastor says

17:37.122 --> 17:39.824
that machines can turn into other machines,

17:39.825 --> 17:42.593
and it's not a sleight against God.

17:42.594 --> 17:44.328
Transformers were a total sleight against God,

17:44.329 --> 17:47.031
inasmuch as God sent His only begotten son

17:47.032 --> 17:49.600
to die on the cross to redeem mankind,

17:49.600 --> 17:50.835
and all we did to pay him back

17:50.836 --> 17:54.464
was make terrible fucking
cartoons like the Transformers.

17:55.007 --> 17:56.841
Nice shot.

17:56.842 --> 18:01.679
Well, 'cause at Bible camp,
we made this flow chart which...

18:01.680 --> 18:03.014
I mean, I don't know,

18:03.015 --> 18:06.184
kind of, like, proved or whatever that...

18:06.185 --> 18:07.318
Well, okay...

18:07.319 --> 18:08.619
Bible camp?!

18:08.620 --> 18:10.109
Since God created...

18:10.656 --> 18:12.890
Since God created man,

18:12.890 --> 18:16.690
and man created the Transformers...

18:17.329 --> 18:20.364
...the Transformers are like
a gift from God, Randal.

18:20.365 --> 18:23.201
No, sir. They are not a gift from God.

18:23.202 --> 18:25.436
They are an unholy curse

18:25.437 --> 18:27.405
from the beast we call the Desolate One.

18:27.406 --> 18:28.873
I don't really want to hear this, Randal.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.441
The first of the fallen,

18:30.442 --> 18:31.809
the spoiler of virgins,

18:31.810 --> 18:34.111
the master of abortions!

18:34.112 --> 18:35.880
You know I don't like to talk
about dark forces, Randal.

18:35.880 --> 18:37.348
Let me help you

18:37.349 --> 18:39.217
Out of your chair, Grandma!

18:39.218 --> 18:41.519
Grandma, what was it like

18:41.520 --> 18:44.689
To be on that holiday site?

18:44.690 --> 18:47.258
Late that night, I awoke from my sleep

18:47.259 --> 18:49.860
Hearing unknown voices

18:49.860 --> 18:51.555
Laughing insane...

18:56.034 --> 18:58.331
Oh...

19:15.620 --> 19:17.955
Oh, what the fuck was that?

19:17.956 --> 19:18.956
What?

19:18.957 --> 19:19.957
That wave.

19:19.958 --> 19:21.792
I saw Becky, so I waved.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.961
She'll be in here in 20 seconds.

19:23.962 --> 19:24.962
And?

19:24.963 --> 19:26.130
And you've got to greet her

19:26.130 --> 19:28.399
before she gets in here, you fuckin' ass-kiss?

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
What's that all about?

19:29.400 --> 19:30.868
It's called friendship.

19:30.869 --> 19:31.869
She's your boss.

19:31.870 --> 19:33.237
You can't be friends with your boss.

19:33.238 --> 19:35.239
No, you can't be friends with your boss.

19:35.240 --> 19:36.574
I like my boss.

19:36.575 --> 19:38.576
I think there's something going on

19:38.577 --> 19:39.744
between you two.

19:39.745 --> 19:40.745
You're crazy.

19:40.746 --> 19:42.747
You spend an awful lot of time talking to her.

19:42.748 --> 19:45.082
I spend an awful lot of time talking to you, too.

19:45.083 --> 19:46.250
And I've always maintained

19:46.250 --> 19:49.120
you're harboring an unrequited
homosexual crush on me.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.288
We're just friends.

19:50.289 --> 19:51.789
That's what I keep telling you.

19:51.790 --> 19:53.791
No, you idiot, me and Becks.

19:53.792 --> 19:55.293
"Becks"?

19:55.294 --> 19:56.294
I knew it.

19:56.295 --> 19:58.796
You're fucking around with the boss.

19:58.797 --> 20:02.300
Yeah, that's why I'm moving
to Florida with my fiancée.

20:02.300 --> 20:03.467
Why would you want to fuck around

20:03.468 --> 20:05.136
with a chick your own age, man?

20:05.137 --> 20:07.138
If you've got to sow some of your wild oats,

20:07.139 --> 20:08.806
there's all these fine young chicks

20:08.807 --> 20:10.541
that stop in here after school.

20:10.542 --> 20:14.078
First off, I'm not cheating on my fiancée.

20:14.079 --> 20:16.681
Secondly, if I was cheating on my fiancée,

20:16.682 --> 20:18.616
it wouldn't be with a teenager.

20:18.617 --> 20:19.684
Why not?

20:19.685 --> 20:21.085
The best part of this job

20:21.086 --> 20:23.587
is all the barely-legal pussy that comes in here.

20:23.588 --> 20:24.989
And they all look up to me,

20:24.990 --> 20:26.757
'cause I've got a driver's license.

20:26.758 --> 20:29.460
It's awesome. You're 33.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.295
You show me one 33-year-old chick

20:31.296 --> 20:32.730
who's as buck-wild in bed

20:32.730 --> 20:34.498
as her 17-year-old counterpart.

20:34.499 --> 20:36.300
17-year-olds nowadays are crazy.

20:36.300 --> 20:37.735
They're up for anything.

20:37.736 --> 20:40.534
They even like it when you go ass to mouth.

20:41.306 --> 20:43.407
Oh... my... God.

20:43.408 --> 20:44.408
What?

20:44.409 --> 20:45.543
Are you serious?

20:45.544 --> 20:47.945
I don't fuck around when it comes to ass to mouth.

20:47.946 --> 20:49.480
You never go ass to mouth.

20:49.480 --> 20:50.848
It's never my idea.

20:50.849 --> 20:52.883
These young girls today get all horned up,

20:52.884 --> 20:54.719
and they tell you to go ass to mouth.

20:54.720 --> 20:56.253
You never go ass to mouth, Randal!

20:56.254 --> 20:57.588
You sound like my mom.

20:57.589 --> 20:59.123
Becks, do you ever go ass to mouth?

20:59.124 --> 21:00.591
You never go ass to mouth.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.293
You've never gone ass to mouth?

21:02.294 --> 21:03.761
You never go ass to mouth.

21:03.762 --> 21:05.329
I've never gone ass to mouth.

21:05.330 --> 21:06.564
Not even once?

21:06.565 --> 21:07.998
Not even ever.

21:07.999 --> 21:09.367
You're both so repressed.

21:09.368 --> 21:10.468
All right, look,

21:10.469 --> 21:12.503
I know you've given a blow job, right?

21:12.504 --> 21:14.505
I haven't even put my purse down yet.

21:14.506 --> 21:15.673
That's a yes.

21:15.674 --> 21:17.875
And I know you've gone down on chicks.

21:17.876 --> 21:19.210
What's your point?

21:19.210 --> 21:20.244
Well,

21:20.245 --> 21:22.446
when you're done chowing down on the no-no parts

21:22.447 --> 21:24.048
of your lover, you kiss him, right?

21:24.049 --> 21:25.716
That's just like going ass to mouth.

21:25.717 --> 21:28.753
Okay, I'm pretty sure you just
compared a vagina to an asshole.

21:28.754 --> 21:30.020
And?

21:30.020 --> 21:32.923
Have you restocked all the napkin holders yet?

21:32.924 --> 21:34.925
That's an Elias job.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.328
That comparison of pink and brown eyes

21:37.329 --> 21:39.029
just made it a Randal job.

21:39.030 --> 21:40.197
Zing!

21:40.198 --> 21:42.723
Shut the fuck up, GoBot.

21:46.772 --> 21:49.206
I could probably sue this
whole corporation right now

21:49.207 --> 21:50.441
for sexual harassment.

21:50.442 --> 21:52.643
You're just making me restock the napkin holders

21:52.644 --> 21:54.111
because of my firmly held beliefs

21:54.112 --> 21:56.113
on the subject of ass to mouth.

21:56.114 --> 21:57.848
You never go ass to mouth!

21:57.849 --> 22:00.681
Would you grow up?

22:03.455 --> 22:05.923
All right, I'm gonna tell you this

22:05.924 --> 22:07.725
'cause we're friends...

22:07.726 --> 22:10.628
but sometimes, in the heat of the moment,

22:10.629 --> 22:13.563
it's forgivable to go ass to mouth.

22:14.766 --> 22:17.097
I knew it.

22:19.137 --> 22:23.140
I'm fuckin' bored, man!

22:23.140 --> 22:28.101
And boredom's the first step
on the road to relapse.

22:42.727 --> 22:44.888
Oh!

22:53.939 --> 22:56.839
Would you fuck me?

22:57.576 --> 23:00.244
I'd fuck me.

23:00.245 --> 23:03.848
I'd fuck me hard.

23:25.337 --> 23:27.828
Shit.

23:28.340 --> 23:30.774
Well, hello, Miss Scott.

23:30.775 --> 23:34.245
Well, here he is, the escape artist.

23:34.246 --> 23:35.779
I'm not gone yet.

23:35.780 --> 23:38.048
Please. You've been gone for the last month.

23:38.049 --> 23:39.383
When do you guys leave?

23:39.384 --> 23:41.652
Well, we start driving tomorrow morning.

23:41.653 --> 23:43.587
Oh, uh, I left you the forwarding address

23:43.588 --> 23:45.523
for my last check on the calendar there.

23:45.524 --> 23:48.025
So you did.

23:48.026 --> 23:50.694
That's her parents' house, right?

23:50.695 --> 23:54.431
Yes, but only until the wedding.

23:54.432 --> 23:56.166
And then, from what I hear,

23:56.167 --> 23:58.536
her parents are giving us a house.

23:58.537 --> 24:00.571
Nice!

24:00.572 --> 24:02.907
So I guess dowries are making a comeback.

24:02.908 --> 24:04.041
Oh, yeah.

24:04.042 --> 24:06.110
Her dad sweetened the pot with two fatted calves

24:06.110 --> 24:07.839
and a goat.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.148
I'm gonna miss you, Hicks.

24:11.149 --> 24:13.083
Yeah, I'm gonna miss you, too.

24:13.084 --> 24:14.218
I still can't believe

24:14.219 --> 24:16.854
you're just gonna leave me alone in this place...

24:16.855 --> 24:18.622
with Randal Graves, of all people.

24:18.623 --> 24:19.757
Quit.

24:19.758 --> 24:20.858
Move to Florida.

24:20.859 --> 24:22.560
You could work at the car wash with me.

24:22.560 --> 24:24.862
Wow, you make it sound so tempting.

24:24.863 --> 24:26.730
How can I say no?

24:26.730 --> 24:29.867
Oh, yeah... 'cause it's a
fucking car wash in Florida.

24:29.868 --> 24:31.569
Like it's any worse than this place.

24:31.570 --> 24:33.637
Hurl the insults all you want, buddy man.

24:33.638 --> 24:35.639
As soon as my uncle's on his feet again,

24:35.640 --> 24:37.675
it's not like I'm gonna be staying here.

24:37.676 --> 24:39.643
- Hey, how's he doing?
- A lot better.

24:39.644 --> 24:41.745
It only took two years and a shitload of chemo,

24:41.746 --> 24:44.181
but... his red cell count's almost back to normal.

24:44.182 --> 24:45.382
That's great.

24:45.383 --> 24:46.884
Yeah, it's great for me, too.

24:46.885 --> 24:48.686
Couple of weeks in this crap shack

24:48.687 --> 24:51.422
turned into a couple of
years a little too quickly.

24:51.423 --> 24:52.923
But, Hicks, we can sit here

24:52.924 --> 24:55.059
making small talk about your last day

24:55.060 --> 24:57.394
and what it is I'm going to do once you're gone,

24:57.395 --> 25:02.166
or we can treat this like any other workday.

25:02.167 --> 25:03.929
Ding-a-ling-a-ling!

25:14.980 --> 25:16.811
Randal.

25:17.415 --> 25:20.484
One ring to rule them all.

25:20.485 --> 25:24.488
And you wonder why no chick'll
let you stick your cock in her.

25:24.489 --> 25:26.657
I never wondered that.

25:26.658 --> 25:28.092
Yeah, 'cause you've accepted the fact

25:28.093 --> 25:30.127
that you'll never get a chick a long time ago.

25:30.128 --> 25:31.629
I could get a chick if I wanted.

25:31.630 --> 25:33.097
Who are you kidding?

25:33.098 --> 25:34.765
You can't get a chick, you mook.

25:34.766 --> 25:36.665
You're too weird and sad.

25:40.472 --> 25:42.806
I turn down chicks left and right.

25:42.807 --> 25:46.299
Your chicks are your "left" and "right."

25:47.078 --> 25:48.946
Yeah, right. What do you know?

25:48.947 --> 25:50.914
Uh, I know you're a huge fuckin' nerd

25:50.915 --> 25:53.751
of Potsie-like proportions,
and no chicks dig nerds,

25:53.752 --> 25:57.016
especially nerds that are into Lord of the Rings.

25:58.089 --> 25:59.890
Chicks dig Lord of the Rings, Randal.

25:59.890 --> 26:01.091
Yeah. The kind of chicks

26:01.092 --> 26:02.926
that are into swords and elves and shit,

26:02.927 --> 26:05.295
and I wouldn't fuck them with the Torch of Gondor.

26:05.296 --> 26:07.525
Oh, you're so gross!

26:09.200 --> 26:11.133
Hey, man.

26:16.908 --> 26:19.209
Welcome to Mooby's. May I take your order?

26:19.210 --> 26:20.344
Yeah, um...

26:20.345 --> 26:21.645
let's see.

26:21.646 --> 26:24.748
Give me one Udderly Delicious Moo-ilk Shake,

26:24.749 --> 26:28.377
Skinny Calf and an order of onion rings. Thanks.

26:30.689 --> 26:34.022
"One ring to rule them all."

26:35.160 --> 26:36.727
"One ring to find them."

26:36.728 --> 26:38.028
Oh, Jesus.

26:38.029 --> 26:40.197
"One ring to bring them all."

26:40.198 --> 26:42.933
"And in the darkness bind them."

26:42.934 --> 26:44.501
Yes! Dude!

26:44.502 --> 26:45.869
How many times?

26:45.870 --> 26:47.171
Well, um, three for Fellowship,

26:47.172 --> 26:48.172
two for Towers,

26:48.173 --> 26:50.307
four for Return.

26:50.308 --> 26:51.575
Five for Return.

26:51.576 --> 26:52.576
Dude!

26:52.577 --> 26:53.677
All right, look,

26:53.678 --> 26:55.746
there's only one Return, okay,

26:55.747 --> 26:58.549
and it ain't of the king... it's of the Jedi.

26:58.550 --> 27:00.451
Oh, Star Wars geek.

27:00.452 --> 27:01.618
Oh, I'm the geek?

27:01.619 --> 27:03.754
Look at you two, whipping out your preciouses.

27:03.755 --> 27:05.222
You'll have to excuse him.

27:05.223 --> 27:07.057
He's not "down" with the trilogy.

27:07.058 --> 27:09.593
Oh, what the fuck happened to this world?

27:09.594 --> 27:10.961
There's only one trilogy,

27:10.962 --> 27:12.730
you fucking morons.

27:12.730 --> 27:14.264
You know what?

27:14.265 --> 27:16.066
Maybe we should start calling your friend Padme,

27:16.067 --> 27:17.968
because he loves Mannequin Skywalker

27:17.969 --> 27:19.303
so much, right?

27:19.304 --> 27:20.971
"Danger, danger.

27:20.972 --> 27:22.306
"My name is Anakin.

27:22.307 --> 27:25.409
My shitty acting is ruining saga."

27:25.410 --> 27:27.745
Yeah. Yeah, you're crazy, Jar-Jar.

27:27.746 --> 27:29.012
Oh, I'm crazy?

27:29.013 --> 27:31.648
Those fucking hobbit
movies were boring as hell.

27:31.649 --> 27:33.984
All it was was a bunch of people walking.

27:33.985 --> 27:36.920
Three movies of people
walking to a fuckin' volcano.

27:36.920 --> 27:39.013
Here's the first movie.

27:43.128 --> 27:46.256
And here's the second movie.

27:51.236 --> 27:53.337
He is way off. Loser.

27:53.338 --> 27:55.362
You ready for the third movie?

28:04.315 --> 28:06.817
Fuckin' A.

28:06.818 --> 28:09.052
Even the fuckin' trees walked in those movies.

28:09.053 --> 28:10.087
You know what?

28:10.088 --> 28:11.288
I've had enough of you.

28:11.289 --> 28:14.558
Your simplistic analysis of the trilogy aside,

28:14.559 --> 28:16.794
The Lord of the Rings was
a massive achievement that

28:16.795 --> 28:17.895
even the Academy recognized

28:17.896 --> 28:20.631
when they gave Peter Jackson
the Best Directing Oscar...

28:20.632 --> 28:24.168
an award your little friend
George "Toy Boy" Lucas has never

28:24.169 --> 28:25.869
and will never win.

28:25.870 --> 28:27.204
Bones.

28:27.205 --> 28:28.405
Oh, sick burn.

28:28.406 --> 28:29.807
Let me tell you something.

28:29.808 --> 28:32.109
If Peter Jackson really wanted to blow me away

28:32.110 --> 28:35.045
with those "Rings" movies,
he would've ended the third one

28:35.046 --> 28:36.547
on the logical closure point,

28:36.548 --> 28:38.982
not the twenty-five endings that followed.

28:38.983 --> 28:40.484
What's the logical closure point?

28:40.485 --> 28:41.685
Yeah, friend,

28:41.686 --> 28:43.053
enlighten us.

28:43.054 --> 28:45.923
When fucking Frito wakes up from
his little coma or whatever,

28:45.924 --> 28:48.692
and the little hobbits are
jumping up and down on his bed,

28:48.693 --> 28:50.194
and Sam leans in the doorway

28:50.195 --> 28:52.162
and gives him that very fuckin' gay look.

28:52.163 --> 28:53.564
Not the Rings, Randal.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.098
Say what you will about Jesus,

28:55.099 --> 28:56.867
but leave the Rings out of this.

28:56.868 --> 28:59.303
I am gonna kick your ass back to the Shire

28:59.304 --> 29:00.671
if you don't shut your fuckin' mouth.

29:00.672 --> 29:03.140
That look was so gay,
I thought Sam was gonna tell

29:03.140 --> 29:04.775
the little hobbits to take a walk

29:04.776 --> 29:06.410
so he could saunter over to Frodo

29:06.410 --> 29:07.744
and suck his fuckin' cock.

29:07.745 --> 29:10.414
Now, that would've been
an Academy Award-worthy ending.

29:10.415 --> 29:14.084
Hey, faggot, they're not gay. They're hobbits.

29:14.085 --> 29:16.687
And then right after the Sam-Frodo suckfest,

29:16.688 --> 29:18.522
right before the credits roll,

29:18.523 --> 29:21.191
Sam fucking flat-out bricks in Frodo's mouth.

29:21.192 --> 29:23.627
I swear...

29:23.628 --> 29:25.322
Fuck you!

29:27.866 --> 29:29.666
I made fun of Lord of the Rings so hard,

29:29.667 --> 29:32.069
it made some super-geek puke all over the counter.

29:32.070 --> 29:33.637
Where do we keep the mop and bucket

29:33.638 --> 29:35.072
so I can have Elias clean it up?

29:35.073 --> 29:37.374
In the closet with the rest
of the cleaning products.

29:37.375 --> 29:41.311
We have cleaning products?

29:44.082 --> 29:46.316
Why does it smell so weird in here?

29:46.317 --> 29:48.250
Buh-bye.

29:48.786 --> 29:51.277
I'm on to you.

29:53.558 --> 29:55.626
You know he's not gonna make it here long

29:55.627 --> 29:58.428
once you're not here to
protect him anymore, don't you?

29:58.429 --> 30:00.831
Well, you're the one out
there encouraging him,

30:00.832 --> 30:02.833
advocating ass to mouth.

30:02.834 --> 30:05.736
I wasn't advocating it, you big prude.

30:05.737 --> 30:07.905
I just said it was fine once in a while.

30:07.906 --> 30:09.907
Like you wouldn't do it if Emma told you to.

30:09.908 --> 30:11.441
Christ, no!

30:11.442 --> 30:14.172
Oh, I thought love knew no bounds.

30:14.879 --> 30:17.281
Ew. That came off kind of catty, didn't it?

30:17.282 --> 30:19.249
A little daytime soapish, yeah.

30:19.250 --> 30:20.417
I'm sorry.

30:20.418 --> 30:22.119
I don't know why I said that.

30:22.120 --> 30:23.854
I actually kind of like Emma.

30:23.855 --> 30:24.955
So do I.

30:24.956 --> 30:27.090
So that's why you're getting married!

30:27.090 --> 30:29.059
I can't wait until you get engaged,

30:29.060 --> 30:31.628
so I can bust your balls as
hard as you've busted mine.

30:31.629 --> 30:34.031
You're going to be waiting a long time, sir.

30:34.032 --> 30:35.499
Oh, that's right. I forgot.

30:35.500 --> 30:37.734
You're the cold-hearted ice princess

30:37.735 --> 30:39.703
that doesn't believe in marriage.

30:39.704 --> 30:41.939
I'm not saying that it's not all right for you,

30:41.940 --> 30:43.140
but, yes, I do think

30:43.140 --> 30:45.575
that marriage goes against our primal nature.

30:45.576 --> 30:46.743
To be loved?

30:46.744 --> 30:49.379
To fuck as much as possible...

30:49.380 --> 30:53.150
spread the seed around and keep the species going.

30:53.150 --> 30:55.285
And all that shit they feed us in the movies

30:55.286 --> 30:56.954
and greeting cards is just propaganda

30:56.955 --> 30:59.589
to get us to marry, have kids
and keep the economy going.

30:59.590 --> 31:02.125
Marriage is just the keystone to economics.

31:02.126 --> 31:03.527
You're such a sappy girl.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.662
- Mm.
- Are you trying to tell me

31:05.663 --> 31:07.431
you don't believe in love, Beckalah?

31:07.432 --> 31:08.765
In romantic love,

31:08.766 --> 31:10.067
no.

31:10.068 --> 31:12.235
Like, I love my parents.

31:12.236 --> 31:14.871
I love my car. I love you.

31:14.872 --> 31:17.541
But romantic love, hearts and flowers,

31:17.542 --> 31:20.377
"There's only one person out there for me"?

31:20.378 --> 31:23.113
Come on, you know how many
people there are out there?

31:23.114 --> 31:24.548
Odds are there's always going

31:24.549 --> 31:26.583
to be someone who's a better match for you

31:26.584 --> 31:28.318
than the person you end up marrying.

31:28.319 --> 31:29.519
So based on your theory,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.955
there's someone out there
better for me than Emma.

31:31.956 --> 31:34.825
Oh, no, I'm not touching that one.

31:34.826 --> 31:36.293
Wait a second.

31:36.294 --> 31:38.028
You don't think I really love her?

31:38.029 --> 31:40.230
I think...

31:40.230 --> 31:42.432
you love what she represents.

31:42.433 --> 31:43.867
Which is?

31:43.868 --> 31:46.103
Come on, Dante, she was
the girl who wouldn't give you

31:46.104 --> 31:47.637
the time of day back in high school.

31:47.638 --> 31:49.539
And years later, after she's played the field

31:49.540 --> 31:52.309
and realized how unsatisfying
the so-called "hotties" are,

31:52.310 --> 31:54.511
she's finally gone with someone who looks...

31:54.512 --> 31:55.812
Oh, my God,

31:55.813 --> 31:57.614
you're gonna say "fugly," aren't you?

31:57.615 --> 31:58.715
Unconventional!

31:58.716 --> 31:59.983
Ah, nice backpedal.

31:59.984 --> 32:01.718
Thank you.

32:01.719 --> 32:03.420
It took her a few years

32:03.420 --> 32:04.755
to finally figure out that thing

32:04.756 --> 32:06.857
that every mother tries
to teach their little girl

32:06.858 --> 32:08.225
but she has to learn on her own,

32:08.226 --> 32:10.594
and that's that guys that look like you

32:10.595 --> 32:12.662
have a lot more to offer, because you'll always

32:12.663 --> 32:14.231
try harder than the pretty boy.

32:14.232 --> 32:17.034
What am I, some hideous fucking CHUD over here?

32:17.035 --> 32:20.003
No, you're a catch... kind of.

32:20.004 --> 32:22.406
And Emma's a catch, too.

32:22.407 --> 32:24.441
'Cause not only is she pretty, but...

32:24.442 --> 32:27.010
she'll make all your decisions for you.

32:27.010 --> 32:29.880
Which is lucky, because you're pretty terrible

32:29.880 --> 32:31.782
at making decisions.

32:31.783 --> 32:33.750
So my last day is all about you telling me

32:33.750 --> 32:35.980
what an ugly, indecisive loser I am?

32:36.654 --> 32:38.522
Come on, you worked at Quick Stop

32:38.523 --> 32:40.123
for, like, a decade,

32:40.124 --> 32:43.427
and you've been here for a year almost,

32:43.428 --> 32:45.996
and since day one at both jobs,

32:45.997 --> 32:47.731
all you've ever said is how you needed

32:47.732 --> 32:49.166
to get out and start your life.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.401
And it wasn't until Emma walked
through the door and was,

32:51.402 --> 32:53.036
like, "Come down to Florida with me,

32:53.037 --> 32:54.404
"and I'll fuck your brains out,

32:54.405 --> 32:56.673
and my daddy will give you a job, and blah-blah,"

32:56.674 --> 32:58.875
that you actually went and did something about it.

32:58.876 --> 33:00.310
And I get it... it's...

33:00.310 --> 33:03.380
she's your golden ticket, dude.

33:03.380 --> 33:05.314
So, uh...

33:05.783 --> 33:07.750
...what's that make you?

33:09.820 --> 33:13.990
I'm just the girl who fucks
ugly, indecisive losers

33:13.990 --> 33:17.289
in the kitchen once this place is closed.

33:17.962 --> 33:19.554
That's me.

33:24.802 --> 33:27.671
That's something for the lovers out there.

33:27.672 --> 33:29.840
J-RAM Radio. Right around high noon...

33:29.840 --> 33:33.640
So, we're never gonna talk about it, are we?

33:34.745 --> 33:37.914
What is there to say?

33:37.915 --> 33:39.816
Do you regret it?

33:39.817 --> 33:41.585
Do you?

33:41.586 --> 33:44.588
I regret that it was on the prep station table.

33:44.589 --> 33:46.389
Yeah, you regret it... you weren't the one

33:46.390 --> 33:48.118
who got mayo in your cooch.

33:56.868 --> 33:59.469
What do you want me to say?

33:59.470 --> 34:01.505
We were drunk, you know?

34:01.506 --> 34:03.440
It just kind of happened.

34:03.440 --> 34:05.775
You're just lucky

34:05.776 --> 34:08.378
I'm not one of those monogamists
like your girlfriend.

34:08.379 --> 34:11.581
Otherwise, I might try
to make you stay in Jersey.

34:11.581 --> 34:14.312
If anyone could do it, it'd be you.

34:23.628 --> 34:27.029
Dude, your old lady's out here looking for you.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.400
Come outside with me. I've got a surprise for you.

34:51.789 --> 34:53.857
That's my surprise?

34:53.858 --> 34:55.882
No.

34:56.726 --> 35:00.492
Goodbye, horses...

35:06.504 --> 35:08.232
Hey.

35:09.207 --> 35:10.740
Oh.

35:10.740 --> 35:12.842
So, um...

35:12.843 --> 35:15.478
are you looking for a good Transformers site?

35:15.479 --> 35:18.548
Because at CarsToBots.com,

35:18.549 --> 35:21.351
you can get an avatar

35:21.352 --> 35:25.555
that's your picture morphed to look like a robot.

35:25.556 --> 35:27.057
Come on, man.

35:27.058 --> 35:28.825
You know I only surf Transformers sites

35:28.826 --> 35:32.727
when there's girls around,
so they can see how cool I am.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.399
So what are you doing then?

35:36.400 --> 35:39.869
Trying to secure a going away
present for Mr. Dante.

35:39.870 --> 35:41.004
Really?

35:41.005 --> 35:44.541
Well, how about an Arwen sword replica?

35:44.542 --> 35:46.443
What?

35:46.444 --> 35:49.246
Uh...

35:49.247 --> 35:52.282
'Cause it's, like, thoughtful and practical.

35:52.283 --> 35:57.120
I was thinking of something a little more sexy.

35:57.120 --> 36:01.258
Well, what's sexier than an elf princess's sword?

36:01.259 --> 36:03.093
A donkey show.

36:03.094 --> 36:04.160
What's that?

36:04.160 --> 36:06.630
You ever see a chick give a mule a blow job?

36:06.630 --> 36:08.398
Oh, no!

36:08.399 --> 36:10.500
Shh!

36:10.500 --> 36:11.901
Jesus!

36:11.902 --> 36:14.337
If you spoil this, I'm gonna brain you.

36:14.338 --> 36:16.373
You gonna keep your mouth shut?

36:16.374 --> 36:18.108
Yes.

36:18.109 --> 36:19.109
God.

36:19.110 --> 36:21.344
That's bestiality, Randal.

36:21.345 --> 36:23.446
At its finest, I hope.

36:23.447 --> 36:25.448
Who'd want to see something like that?

36:25.449 --> 36:27.951
Me, Dante, you.

36:27.952 --> 36:29.586
I don't want to see something like that.

36:29.587 --> 36:31.488
Why would you want to see something like that?

36:31.489 --> 36:33.089
Because it's fucked up.

36:33.090 --> 36:34.291
And I want to see

36:34.292 --> 36:36.893
if a chick with a mouthful
of donkey spunk swallows.

36:36.894 --> 36:38.295
All right, here we go.

36:38.296 --> 36:40.730
"Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud.

36:40.730 --> 36:43.266
"Straight from their dirty debut in Tijuana,

36:43.267 --> 36:45.201
"Kelly's taking it on the road.

36:45.202 --> 36:47.704
Taking it in the ass, that is."

36:47.705 --> 36:50.907
You got to give it up for Oscar
Wilde-like wordplay that good.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.575
Do they show pictures?

36:52.576 --> 36:55.445
Only one of Kinky Kelly
sucking off Optimus Prime.

36:55.446 --> 36:56.446
Really?

36:56.447 --> 36:58.081
Ow.

36:58.082 --> 36:59.582
Let me borrow your cellphone.

36:59.583 --> 37:00.617
Whoa.

37:00.618 --> 37:02.552
Well, 'cause, I'm only supposed to use it

37:02.553 --> 37:04.688
to call my parents in case of an emergency.

37:04.689 --> 37:05.855
This is an emergency.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.724
We got to lock up Kinky Kelly for tonight,

37:07.725 --> 37:10.660
so we can give Mr. Dante a memorable send-off.

37:10.660 --> 37:13.496
You love Mr. Dante, don't you?

37:13.497 --> 37:14.798
In a non-gay way.

37:14.799 --> 37:16.232
Then give me your phone.

37:16.233 --> 37:18.368
'Cause Mr. Dante's never seen a donkey show.

37:18.369 --> 37:20.904
And it'd be nice to give
him this before he goes off

37:20.905 --> 37:23.239
to Florida and gets married and
does all those other things

37:23.240 --> 37:24.774
that prevent a guy from ever seeing

37:24.775 --> 37:26.609
a fucked-up donkey show in his lifetime.

37:26.610 --> 37:27.977
Hello.

37:27.978 --> 37:31.147
Uh, I was hoping to schedule
Kinky Kelly for a performance.

37:31.148 --> 37:33.049
Tonight.

37:33.050 --> 37:34.718
Okay.

37:34.719 --> 37:36.386
I'm on hold.

37:36.387 --> 37:39.456
Fingers crossed.

37:39.457 --> 37:42.892
We should probably cross dicks, too.

37:42.893 --> 37:43.893
No.

37:43.894 --> 37:45.929
Work, work, work.

37:45.930 --> 37:47.697
That's all you ever think about, Hicks.

37:47.698 --> 37:48.565
Hey, Becks.

37:48.566 --> 37:50.795
Hey, Emma.

37:51.802 --> 37:53.470
Great shirt.

37:53.470 --> 37:54.938
Isn't it? I love it.

37:54.939 --> 37:57.273
What I love even more are these.

37:57.274 --> 37:58.308
These came in early,

37:58.309 --> 38:00.510
and I just had to come back and show Dante.

38:00.510 --> 38:02.379
And give you yours, of course.

38:02.380 --> 38:04.814
And I have one for Randal, I guess.

38:04.815 --> 38:06.583
What is it?

38:06.584 --> 38:08.017
Look, I know it's three months away,

38:08.018 --> 38:10.887
but it would mean so much to us
if you could make the trip down.

38:10.888 --> 38:13.856
Well... yeah.

38:14.692 --> 38:16.192
Uh, I wouldn't miss it.

38:16.193 --> 38:18.495
I thought we were waiting
till we got down there

38:18.496 --> 38:19.829
before we picked a date.

38:19.830 --> 38:21.731
Oh, him is so cute.

38:21.732 --> 38:23.631
Him thinking again, huh?

38:24.468 --> 38:26.202
If we left anything up to these jackals,

38:26.203 --> 38:28.398
nothing would ever get done, would it?

38:29.206 --> 38:31.697
I'm just teasing.

38:35.846 --> 38:38.814
Guess you got to make their
decisions for 'em sometimes.

38:45.956 --> 38:47.056
All right, I've got it.

38:47.057 --> 38:48.124
I will see you then.

38:48.125 --> 38:49.692
Thank you.

38:49.693 --> 38:51.528
My friend, tonight,

38:51.529 --> 38:54.554
we bring a bit of TJ to the Jersey 'burbs.

38:55.466 --> 38:57.066
Well, I don't know about this, Randal.

38:57.067 --> 38:59.169
I mean, how do we know this isn't a hoax?

38:59.170 --> 39:01.070
Like, were there any pictures on the Web site?

39:01.070 --> 39:02.539
Strangely, no.

39:02.540 --> 39:05.141
But if you've seen pics of
one chick sucking off a donkey,

39:05.142 --> 39:07.343
you've seen them all.

39:07.344 --> 39:09.045
Well, what if you haven't ever seen pics

39:09.046 --> 39:10.814
of anything like that?

39:10.815 --> 39:13.049
Well, then you must be as blind as Anne Frank.

39:13.050 --> 39:15.285
'Cause what's the point in
having an Internet connection

39:15.286 --> 39:17.754
if you're not using it to look
at weird, fucked-up pictures

39:17.755 --> 39:20.246
of dirty sex you'll never have yourself?

39:26.430 --> 39:30.099
Ho-ly shit.

39:30.100 --> 39:33.736
You know, I've never pieced
this together until right now.

39:33.737 --> 39:35.238
You're a virgin, aren't you?

39:35.239 --> 39:37.073
You know I have a girlfriend, Randal.

39:37.074 --> 39:38.007
Oh, yeah.

39:38.008 --> 39:39.242
What's her name again?

39:39.243 --> 39:41.244
Myra Hodgkiss.

39:41.245 --> 39:43.046
You made her up, didn't you?

39:43.047 --> 39:44.781
That name sounds so made-up.

39:44.782 --> 39:47.283
No.

39:47.284 --> 39:49.652
Seriously, Elias, have you and Myra had sex yet?

39:49.653 --> 39:52.055
Well, that's just kind of personal, Randal.

39:52.056 --> 39:53.089
Come on!

39:53.090 --> 39:55.558
I tell you about my sex life all the time.

39:55.559 --> 39:56.893
I let you smell my fingers

39:56.894 --> 39:58.595
after I fucked Taton Weathers' kid sister

39:58.596 --> 40:00.263
in the office that one time, didn't I?

40:00.264 --> 40:03.324
You kind of made me smell your fingers.

40:04.134 --> 40:06.769
Maybe you just don't like the pussy.

40:06.770 --> 40:08.605
Maybe you're all about the cock.

40:08.606 --> 40:10.874
No, no, I like the pussy.

40:10.875 --> 40:12.008
So come on.

40:12.009 --> 40:14.410
Did Myra ever give you a
crack at her crack or what?

40:14.410 --> 40:17.247
Well, not that it's any
of your business, Randal,

40:17.248 --> 40:18.448
but she can't.

40:18.449 --> 40:20.416
Why?

40:21.285 --> 40:23.653
Jesus, Elias, come on.

40:23.654 --> 40:25.655
You got to start trusting me more.

40:25.656 --> 40:27.223
Because once Dante's gone,

40:27.224 --> 40:29.316
you're gonna be my new best friend.

40:31.562 --> 40:32.762
No, I'm not.

40:32.763 --> 40:34.964
Who the fuck else am I gonna hang out with?

40:34.965 --> 40:36.533
It's gonna be you and me, buddy.

40:36.534 --> 40:37.567
So come on.

40:37.568 --> 40:38.768
You got to start trusting me more.

40:38.769 --> 40:41.464
Open up and tell me shit.

40:41.972 --> 40:45.202
Like why haven't you fucked Myra yet?

40:47.978 --> 40:51.748
Well, we can't because of Pillow Pants.

40:51.749 --> 40:53.816
What the fuck's Pillow Pants?

40:53.817 --> 40:58.413
Pillow Pants is a little
troll who lives in her pussy.

41:06.096 --> 41:09.832
Pillow Pants is her pussy troll.

41:09.833 --> 41:11.800
Duh.

41:13.304 --> 41:16.005
You know how every girl's parents

41:16.006 --> 41:20.543
put a pussy troll in them
when the girls are young

41:20.544 --> 41:24.036
to keep them from having premarital sex?

41:25.583 --> 41:26.983
Sure.

41:26.984 --> 41:30.386
Well, Myra's is named Pillow Pants.

41:30.387 --> 41:35.124
And so, even though she totally
wants to have sex with me,

41:35.125 --> 41:39.896
Myra says if I put my thing in her,

41:39.897 --> 41:42.592
Pillow Pants will bite it off.

41:44.034 --> 41:47.637
So I got to wait until Pillow Pants

41:47.638 --> 41:51.574
gets peed out of her body on her 21st birthday

41:51.575 --> 41:54.510
before we can have sex.

41:54.510 --> 41:57.146
And Myra told you this?

41:57.147 --> 41:58.247
Boyfriends and girlfriends

41:58.248 --> 42:00.850
talk to each other about sex stuff, Randal.

42:00.850 --> 42:02.986
You'd know this if you ever had a girlfriend.

42:02.987 --> 42:06.155
Have you and Myra even kissed yet?

42:06.156 --> 42:10.057
We would have already,
if it wasn't for Lister Fiend.

42:11.595 --> 42:14.163
Lister Fiend is her mouth troll, isn't it?

42:14.164 --> 42:16.529
Women.

42:21.639 --> 42:23.439
I'll be right back.

42:23.440 --> 42:27.143
You are never gonna believe
what Elias just told me.

42:27.144 --> 42:28.702
Look who it is, Randal.

42:29.146 --> 42:31.214
Randal Graves.

42:31.215 --> 42:32.749
You work here, too?

42:32.750 --> 42:35.885
Jesus. Anyone else from
our graduating class back there?

42:35.886 --> 42:36.886
Well, well, well...

42:36.887 --> 42:39.055
Pickle Fucker.

42:39.056 --> 42:41.224
Man, look at you two fun-ployees.

42:41.225 --> 42:42.558
Nothing's changed.

42:42.559 --> 42:44.594
You know, I'll bet dollars to donuts,

42:44.595 --> 42:45.828
when you two aren't fighting

42:45.829 --> 42:48.631
about who shot first, Han or Greedo,

42:48.632 --> 42:50.667
you can still muster up enough energy

42:50.668 --> 42:52.935
to make fun of other people.

42:52.936 --> 42:55.204
Yeah. So hurry up and order and get out of here,

42:55.205 --> 42:56.906
so we can make fun of you.

42:56.907 --> 42:58.775
Oh, I don't know if you're in a position

42:58.776 --> 43:00.777
to make fun of anyone anymore, Graves.

43:00.778 --> 43:03.546
Thirty-two and you're flipping burgers?

43:03.547 --> 43:05.581
Before that, I'd heard it was the Quick Stop

43:05.582 --> 43:07.684
for, what, like, ten years?

43:07.685 --> 43:11.382
We can't all be Internet millionaires.

43:12.189 --> 43:13.423
Who's an Internet millionaire?

43:13.424 --> 43:15.291
Elias, this is Lance Dowds.

43:15.292 --> 43:16.659
We went to high school together.

43:16.660 --> 43:17.994
A few years ago,

43:17.995 --> 43:20.463
he built a search engine which
compiles the lowest prices

43:20.464 --> 43:23.066
of merchandise you can buy online.

43:23.067 --> 43:25.535
You might have heard of it... MadDucketts.com.

43:25.536 --> 43:27.837
Didn't that just sell to Amazon
for, like, 20 million bucks?

43:27.838 --> 43:29.372
Yeah, but back before

43:29.373 --> 43:32.408
he was the Mad Ducketts guy,
he was just Pickle Fucker.

43:32.409 --> 43:33.810
You see, freshman year,

43:33.810 --> 43:35.912
the seniors would hunt us
down and put us through

43:35.913 --> 43:37.580
what they called initiations.

43:37.580 --> 43:38.915
They'd stuff us into lockers

43:38.916 --> 43:40.983
or throw us in the girls' shower room naked.

43:40.984 --> 43:42.819
But Lance here got the worst of it.

43:42.820 --> 43:44.887
The seniors yanked down his pants,

43:44.888 --> 43:46.456
and shoved a pickle up his ass,

43:46.457 --> 43:47.824
and made him walk ten feet.

43:47.825 --> 43:50.860
The pickle fell out
before he hit the ten-foot mark.

43:50.860 --> 43:56.065
He had to take a bite of it,
reinsert it and walk again.

43:56.066 --> 43:57.467
Ew...

43:57.468 --> 43:59.702
Yeah, but don't worry... he made it.

43:59.703 --> 44:01.938
His pickle was small enough to stay wedged

44:01.939 --> 44:03.539
after only four bites.

44:03.540 --> 44:05.408
I'll bet you're the only guy in the world

44:05.409 --> 44:07.143
who still remembers that, Graves.

44:07.144 --> 44:09.912
Oh, I bet you still remember it pretty vividly...

44:09.913 --> 44:10.913
Pickle Fucker.

44:10.914 --> 44:12.181
Do you have any interest

44:12.182 --> 44:14.450
in building the ultimate fan site

44:14.450 --> 44:17.854
for both The Lord of the Rings
and The Transformers?

44:17.855 --> 44:20.380
Because I'd moderate it for free.

44:20.758 --> 44:22.024
Ease up, Pillow Pants.

44:22.025 --> 44:24.761
The dude's not into your D&D, GoBots bullshit.

44:24.762 --> 44:25.828
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

44:25.829 --> 44:26.829
Don't insult the guy.

44:26.830 --> 44:29.866
The GoBots are like the Kmart of Transformers.

44:29.867 --> 44:32.927
Thank you!

44:33.270 --> 44:35.772
I keep telling them that.

44:35.773 --> 44:37.607
Here, here's my e-mail address.

44:37.608 --> 44:40.676
Drop me a line with some of your ideas.

44:40.677 --> 44:42.166
Cool.

44:48.085 --> 44:50.186
Okay, let's see.

44:50.187 --> 44:52.321
What do I want?

44:52.322 --> 44:56.325
Uh... how about a Skinny Calf
with cheese and a Diet Coke?

44:56.326 --> 44:59.522
I'll get your order.

45:05.102 --> 45:06.626
Here you go.

45:07.270 --> 45:08.538
Well, that was fast.

45:08.539 --> 45:09.972
And fresh.

45:09.973 --> 45:12.008
Thanks. Come again.

45:12.009 --> 45:15.111
Yo, let's wrap this up
so I can get my Cow Tipper on.

45:15.112 --> 45:16.312
You know what?

45:16.313 --> 45:17.802
Take mine.

45:18.615 --> 45:21.083
Something tells me I'm not gonna like it, am I?

45:22.219 --> 45:24.277
Wow, thanks, Pickle Fucker.

45:25.022 --> 45:27.356
Yo, so Pickle Fucker gave us free eats!

45:27.357 --> 45:29.425
You know, I don't eat fast food.

45:29.426 --> 45:30.793
It's not good for you.

45:30.794 --> 45:34.730
But when I heard you guys
were actually working here,

45:34.730 --> 45:36.933
well, I just had to see it for myself.

45:36.934 --> 45:39.769
It's kind of nice having that kind of free time.

45:39.770 --> 45:42.271
Just like it's kind of comforting to know

45:42.272 --> 45:45.935
that some things never change.

45:48.145 --> 45:52.547
Take care, clerks.

45:56.086 --> 45:58.417
Ooh, sick burn.

46:00.724 --> 46:02.525
Fuck this.

46:02.526 --> 46:03.759
Let me borrow your car.

46:03.760 --> 46:04.861
You're supposed to be working.

46:04.862 --> 46:07.129
I got to get out of here for a few minutes.

46:07.130 --> 46:08.464
Let me borrow your car.

46:08.465 --> 46:11.126
Elias, tell Becky we'll be right back.

46:15.539 --> 46:18.030
Where we going?

46:25.849 --> 46:30.019
You know, this tastes like
piss and flies, don't it?

46:30.020 --> 46:32.154
Sure you want to do this?

46:32.155 --> 46:33.256
Oh, yeah.

46:33.257 --> 46:35.850
This will make me feel better.

47:51.168 --> 47:53.235
Here's what I don't understand about you.

47:53.236 --> 47:56.238
You have a license, you can drive a grown-up car.

47:56.239 --> 47:57.707
But when you ride the go-carts,

47:57.708 --> 47:59.976
you somehow feel better about yourself.

47:59.977 --> 48:02.044
Look, it just centers me, all right?

48:02.045 --> 48:04.613
Kind of the way jerking off at work centers you.

48:04.614 --> 48:06.882
I only did it that one time.

48:06.883 --> 48:08.250
And it wasn't to center me.

48:08.250 --> 48:09.919
Yeah, it was to come.

48:09.920 --> 48:12.421
Well, I don't know about you,
but coming centers me.

48:12.422 --> 48:13.923
Then why did we have to leave work,

48:13.924 --> 48:15.825
so we can ride the go-carts to clear your head?

48:15.826 --> 48:18.094
Well, I don't want to jerk off
in the Mooby's bathroom.

48:18.095 --> 48:19.495
What if a customer comes in

48:19.496 --> 48:22.631
and my jerking off gets him
all sex nuts and retard strong?

48:22.632 --> 48:23.766
Suddenly, I'm fighting him off

48:23.767 --> 48:25.835
as he tries to jam my dick in his mouth.

48:25.836 --> 48:28.236
The most likeliest of scenarios.

48:28.972 --> 48:32.508
Man, that shit Lance said
must have really bothered you.

48:32.509 --> 48:33.576
Oh, fuck him.

48:33.577 --> 48:35.544
He's an asshole. He always was.

48:36.179 --> 48:39.048
I'm sorry I let him bug me even for a second.

48:39.049 --> 48:41.744
At least I got a go-cart trip out of it.

48:43.286 --> 48:44.820
Why do the go-carts help?

48:44.820 --> 48:46.422
I don't know.

48:46.423 --> 48:49.125
They just remind me of a better time in my life.

48:49.126 --> 48:51.160
Like when?

48:51.160 --> 48:54.296
Like when we were young and the
world was still in front of us.

48:54.297 --> 48:55.865
We're not that old.

48:55.866 --> 48:56.999
Yeah.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.367
But sometimes I get the feeling

48:58.368 --> 49:01.137
the world kind of left us behind a long time ago.

49:01.138 --> 49:02.138
You know...

49:02.139 --> 49:04.673
you can do something about that.

49:04.674 --> 49:08.010
I told you, I don't want to jerk
off in the bathroom at work.

49:08.010 --> 49:10.913
No, I mean you can get out of Mooby's, too,

49:10.914 --> 49:12.982
completely change your situation in life.

49:12.983 --> 49:16.819
What'd be the point? Besides,
why do you give a shit?

49:16.820 --> 49:18.344
You're leaving.

49:30.967 --> 49:32.401
Thanks, you guys, thanks.

49:32.402 --> 49:33.402
Come on!

49:33.403 --> 49:34.937
Oh, I'm sorry.

49:34.938 --> 49:36.138
Was that a number two you wanted?

49:36.139 --> 49:37.706
Yeah, and bovine-size it.

49:37.707 --> 49:38.707
$13.84.

49:38.708 --> 49:40.810
I need two Surlies and a Cow Tipper.

49:40.810 --> 49:41.811
I'm on it.

49:41.812 --> 49:42.812
How we set for fries?

49:42.813 --> 49:44.313
I don't think these look right.

49:44.314 --> 49:48.017
Jesus! Step away from the fryer
before you burn us all alive.

49:48.018 --> 49:50.252
It's not my fault you abandoned your post!

49:50.253 --> 49:52.321
Was it too much to ask
that you handle the fries?

49:52.322 --> 49:53.823
The machine does all the work.

49:53.824 --> 49:55.491
What's a machine got to transform

49:55.492 --> 49:58.627
into some giant fucking robot
before you'll take it seriously?

49:58.628 --> 49:59.762
Go home.

49:59.763 --> 50:01.430
Will you just make some fries already?

50:01.430 --> 50:02.965
Look, I don't have all night.

50:02.966 --> 50:03.966
I'm sorry, ma'am.

50:03.967 --> 50:05.734
They need to get some
Mexicans working in here.

50:05.735 --> 50:06.735
They'd be...

50:06.736 --> 50:07.736
They don't play around.

50:07.737 --> 50:11.040
I know it. Mexican made me lose my job.

50:11.040 --> 50:13.342
That motherfucker put a
roof up in thirty seconds.

50:13.343 --> 50:14.677
Where the fuck did you guys go?

50:14.678 --> 50:15.878
You don't want to know.

50:15.879 --> 50:16.979
Well, I know it's your last day and all,

50:16.980 --> 50:18.180
but while you're still on the clock,

50:18.180 --> 50:19.982
can't you kind of pretend
like you still give a shit?

50:19.983 --> 50:21.016
Don't blame this guy.

50:21.017 --> 50:23.152
Some cock stain that we
went to high school with

50:23.153 --> 50:25.087
showed up to remind us
that we're fucking failures,

50:25.088 --> 50:26.722
so I wanted to get out of here

50:26.723 --> 50:28.591
and blow off some steam, if you must know.

50:28.592 --> 50:30.526
Did he say "cock stain"?

50:30.527 --> 50:32.528
What the fuck is cock stain?

50:32.529 --> 50:34.396
I don't know... that's some white freaky stuff.

50:34.397 --> 50:37.066
White boys get the white women to do everything.

50:37.067 --> 50:38.467
You want to do a cock stain?

50:38.468 --> 50:40.569
Do you know how often I've had people come in here

50:40.570 --> 50:41.804
that I went to school with?

50:41.805 --> 50:43.939
Fuck, I had to take a fucking order off of a guy

50:43.940 --> 50:45.141
I blew after junior prom once.

50:45.142 --> 50:47.076
Yeah, I've waited on your brother, too... h'noop!

50:47.077 --> 50:48.210
I can't believe you.

50:48.210 --> 50:49.712
The smartest of smart asses got rattled

50:49.713 --> 50:51.213
by some fucking loser coming in here

50:51.214 --> 50:52.715
giving you shit about your McJob.

50:52.716 --> 50:54.049
Oh, fuck him, okay?

50:54.050 --> 50:56.252
Sooner or later, I'll do something with myself

50:56.253 --> 50:57.553
and make my mark.

50:57.554 --> 51:00.823
But until then, whatever I do
is not a waste of time,

51:00.824 --> 51:02.358
it's all building toward something.

51:02.359 --> 51:05.060
How about you build towards
making some fuckin' fries?

51:05.060 --> 51:06.095
They're coming!

51:06.096 --> 51:08.130
Remember, you saved.

51:08.130 --> 51:09.365
You don't use that kind of language.

51:09.366 --> 51:11.000
Ain't nobody from my church in here.

51:11.000 --> 51:12.468
I don't mind people snickering

51:12.469 --> 51:14.270
at the stupid uniform I've got to wear.

51:14.270 --> 51:15.905
But I'll be damned if I'm gonna let

51:15.906 --> 51:18.307
some self-righteous, lucky turd come in here

51:18.308 --> 51:19.642
and treat me and Dante

51:19.643 --> 51:21.677
like we're a couple of fucking porch monkeys.

51:21.678 --> 51:23.078
Randal!

51:23.079 --> 51:24.346
Uh, I'm-I'm sorry. He...

51:24.347 --> 51:27.816
He didn't really just say what I think he said.

51:27.817 --> 51:29.652
- What? Porch monkeys?
- Randal!

51:29.653 --> 51:31.187
What the fuck is wrong with you?!

51:31.188 --> 51:33.122
I want my money back right now.

51:33.123 --> 51:34.356
Of course. Um, you know what?

51:34.357 --> 51:35.724
Here, take this on us.

51:35.725 --> 51:36.992
Oh, no, no, no.

51:36.993 --> 51:38.093
I'm not eating something that

51:38.094 --> 51:40.262
was cooked by some cracker-ass hate-monger.

51:40.263 --> 51:41.330
I will.

51:41.330 --> 51:42.831
Baby, you can't taste racism.

51:42.832 --> 51:44.767
What racism? Porch monkeys?!

51:44.768 --> 51:46.669
- You little mother...
- Calm down, champ.

51:46.670 --> 51:47.670
It ain't worth it.

51:47.670 --> 51:48.737
You're lucky my husband doesn't

51:48.738 --> 51:51.106
jump across this counter
and knock your teeth in.

51:51.107 --> 51:53.442
- Why?
- Yeah, baby, why?

51:53.443 --> 51:55.010
I mean, ain't like he called us porch monkeys.

51:55.010 --> 51:56.078
Hey, hey!

51:56.079 --> 51:56.946
Baby, stop hitting on me!

51:56.947 --> 51:58.180
See, the judge told you about that.

51:58.180 --> 51:59.715
You got to stop putting your hands on people.

51:59.716 --> 52:01.283
Here, take this. This is your money.

52:01.284 --> 52:02.585
Please, take the food on us.

52:02.586 --> 52:03.586
- We're sorry.
- Oh, uh-uh.

52:03.587 --> 52:04.687
I'm gonna write to the paper about this,

52:04.688 --> 52:06.222
and all y'all getting fired up in here.

52:06.223 --> 52:07.356
Jesus!

52:07.357 --> 52:08.624
I'm gonna take the food.

52:08.625 --> 52:11.958
Thank you very much.

52:13.863 --> 52:15.197
Damn!

52:15.198 --> 52:16.198
Fuckin' porch monkey...

52:16.199 --> 52:17.866
Thanks. Come again.

52:17.867 --> 52:19.702
Don't leave me, baby!

52:19.703 --> 52:21.470
Are you out of your fucking mind?!

52:21.470 --> 52:22.838
What?! What's the big deal?

52:22.839 --> 52:25.341
Since when is it a crime to say "porch monkey"?

52:25.342 --> 52:27.209
Oh, I don't know... since forever!

52:27.210 --> 52:28.777
- Why?
- Because "porch monkey"

52:28.778 --> 52:30.646
is a racial slur against black people.

52:30.647 --> 52:32.781
No, it's not. "Nigger" is.

52:32.782 --> 52:33.849
Randal!

52:33.850 --> 52:36.218
Did Randal just call Mr. Dante a nigger?

52:36.219 --> 52:37.553
Shut up, Elias!

52:37.554 --> 52:39.855
I didn't just call Dante a nigger.

52:39.856 --> 52:42.224
I just said that "nigger" is a racial slur.

52:42.225 --> 52:43.559
So is "porch monkey"!

52:43.560 --> 52:45.027
Oh, it is not.

52:45.028 --> 52:48.764
Coon, spook, spade, moolie, jiggaboo, nignug...

52:48.765 --> 52:49.865
those are racial slurs.

52:49.866 --> 52:51.133
"Porch monkey" is not.

52:51.134 --> 52:52.968
I am going to pretend like this conversation

52:52.969 --> 52:54.470
didn't happen.

52:54.470 --> 52:55.871
Elias, go pick up that fucking mess,

52:55.872 --> 52:57.964
and you are this close to getting shit-canned!

52:58.808 --> 53:01.333
Fuckin' shoot me now.

53:02.646 --> 53:03.879
What are you doing?!

53:03.880 --> 53:05.281
Are you trying to get fired?

53:05.282 --> 53:08.517
Since when did "porch monkey"
suddenly become a racial slur?

53:08.518 --> 53:11.053
When ignorant racists started
saying it a hundred years ago.

53:11.054 --> 53:12.288
Oh, bullshit.

53:12.289 --> 53:14.823
My grandmother used to call me
a porch monkey all the time

53:14.824 --> 53:16.825
when I was a kid, because I'd sit on the porch

53:16.826 --> 53:17.926
and stare at my neighbors.

53:17.927 --> 53:18.927
Despite the fact

53:18.928 --> 53:20.663
that your grandmother might have used it

53:20.664 --> 53:22.097
as a term of endearment for you,

53:22.098 --> 53:23.666
it's still a racial slur.

53:23.667 --> 53:26.135
It'd be like your grandmother
calling you a little kike.

53:26.136 --> 53:27.169
Oh, it is not.

53:27.170 --> 53:28.337
Plus, my grandmother had

53:28.338 --> 53:31.106
nothing but the utmost respect
for the Jewish community.

53:31.107 --> 53:32.841
When I was a kid, she told me to always treat

53:32.842 --> 53:35.811
the Jewish kids well, or they'd
put the sheeny curse on me.

53:35.812 --> 53:37.513
What the fuck, man?!

53:37.514 --> 53:38.314
What?!

53:38.315 --> 53:40.015
"Sheeny" is a racial slur, too!

53:40.016 --> 53:41.083
Oh, it is not.

53:41.084 --> 53:42.351
Yes, it is!

53:42.352 --> 53:44.186
Well, she never called any Jews sheeny.

53:44.187 --> 53:45.954
She just used to say "sheeny curse" a lot.

53:45.955 --> 53:46.955
It was cute.

53:46.956 --> 53:49.058
It wasn't cute! It was racist!

53:49.059 --> 53:50.192
I disagree, man.

53:50.193 --> 53:51.360
She was just an old-timer.

53:51.360 --> 53:53.195
That's the way people talked back then.

53:53.196 --> 53:56.031
Didn't mean they were racists.

53:56.032 --> 53:59.201
But my grandmother did refer
to a broken beer bottle once

53:59.202 --> 54:00.999
as a nigger knife.

54:01.338 --> 54:03.539
You know, come to think of it,

54:03.540 --> 54:05.407
my grandmother was kind of a racist.

54:05.408 --> 54:06.642
You think?!

54:06.643 --> 54:08.210
Well, I still don't think

54:08.210 --> 54:10.546
"porch monkey" should be
considered a racial term.

54:10.547 --> 54:12.815
I mean, I've always used it
to describe lazy people,

54:12.816 --> 54:14.083
not lazy black people.

54:14.084 --> 54:15.417
I think if we really tried,

54:15.418 --> 54:17.686
we could reclaim "porch monkey" and save it.

54:17.687 --> 54:18.987
It can't be saved, Randal.

54:18.988 --> 54:20.656
The sole purpose for its creation,

54:20.657 --> 54:22.524
the only reason it exists in the first place,

54:22.525 --> 54:24.493
is to disparage an entire race.

54:24.494 --> 54:25.828
And even if it could be saved,

54:25.829 --> 54:27.963
you can't save it, because you're not black!

54:27.964 --> 54:29.498
Well, listen to you.

54:29.499 --> 54:32.701
Telling me I can't do something
because of the color of my skin?

54:32.702 --> 54:34.567
You're the racist.

54:36.506 --> 54:39.474
I'm taking it back. You watch.

54:41.010 --> 54:42.511
Hey.

54:42.512 --> 54:45.347
What can I get for you,
you little porch monkey?

54:45.348 --> 54:48.282
It's cool. I'm taking it back.

55:27.857 --> 55:29.158
Hey.

55:29.159 --> 55:30.192
Hey.

55:30.193 --> 55:33.423
So, are you scared about getting married at all?

55:36.366 --> 55:37.399
Um...

55:37.400 --> 55:40.035
were we in the middle of a conversation

55:40.036 --> 55:41.236
I don't remember leaving?

55:41.237 --> 55:44.706
I was just thinking about it, and I was thinking

55:44.707 --> 55:47.209
that maybe you were waiting for some friend

55:47.210 --> 55:48.243
to try and stop you

55:48.244 --> 55:49.678
from going through with the wedding

55:49.679 --> 55:52.414
by asking if you're even
ready to go and get married.

55:52.415 --> 55:54.416
So I'm asking.

55:54.417 --> 55:56.218
Are you scared about getting married?

55:56.219 --> 55:58.086
Well, kind of.

55:58.087 --> 56:00.456
I mean, I'm not scared
of getting married, you know...

56:00.457 --> 56:02.925
I always wanted to get married one day...

56:02.926 --> 56:05.394
but I am scared of the wedding.

56:05.395 --> 56:07.886
Why?

56:09.098 --> 56:11.828
I don't know how to dance.

56:13.036 --> 56:14.303
You're kidding.

56:14.304 --> 56:15.637
I wish I was.

56:15.638 --> 56:17.739
You're about to tie your life to someone,

56:17.740 --> 56:18.874
someone who doesn't even really get you

56:18.875 --> 56:19.975
as well as your friends do,

56:19.976 --> 56:23.245
and what you're sweating
is dancing at your reception?

56:23.246 --> 56:25.414
Well, I figure she'll eventually get me.

56:25.415 --> 56:27.249
I mean, you're married to someone long enough,

56:27.250 --> 56:28.717
they got to get you eventually, right?

56:28.718 --> 56:29.718
Are you kidding?

56:29.719 --> 56:32.754
My parents have been
married for thirty-five years,

56:32.755 --> 56:34.423
and they still don't get each other.

56:34.424 --> 56:38.594
Emma's pretty, smart, happy, a good person...

56:38.595 --> 56:41.096
and for some strange reason, she loves me.

56:41.097 --> 56:42.097
I mean, what am I supposed to do,

56:42.098 --> 56:43.265
pass up on that because I have

56:43.266 --> 56:44.800
a few stupid doubts and some jitters?

56:44.800 --> 56:47.736
Besides, dancing at the reception's

56:47.737 --> 56:48.770
the more imperative concern at this point,

56:48.770 --> 56:49.938
because I only get,

56:49.939 --> 56:53.340
well, presumably, one chance
to dance at my wedding.

56:55.612 --> 56:57.312
So, what, you can't slow dance?

56:57.313 --> 56:59.915
No. Anybody can slow dance,

56:59.916 --> 57:02.317
but this is one of the only
times I've ever gonna meet

57:02.318 --> 57:04.319
most of Emma's extended family,

57:04.320 --> 57:06.154
and I'd like to be able to show some flair

57:06.155 --> 57:07.623
on the dance floor, you know?

57:07.624 --> 57:10.592
Like, make an impression
so that maybe they'll see

57:10.593 --> 57:12.160
whatever it is that Emma sees in me

57:12.160 --> 57:15.264
instead of all feeling like
I'm some burger-peddling loser

57:15.265 --> 57:17.062
who couldn't even bust a move.

57:18.568 --> 57:20.402
What?

57:20.403 --> 57:23.064
You're serious?

57:28.578 --> 57:30.102
Come on.

57:33.082 --> 57:35.743
Hey, 12-step!

57:37.086 --> 57:39.451
Jay!

57:41.057 --> 57:43.025
Lord?

57:43.026 --> 57:45.118
Up here, jackass.

57:46.529 --> 57:49.331
What the fuck are you doing up there?!

57:49.332 --> 57:50.432
Yo, if you're gonna jump,

57:50.433 --> 57:52.334
let me get a crack at that pussy first.

57:52.335 --> 57:53.769
Let me find out.

57:53.770 --> 57:56.500
You still got your boom box?

57:59.042 --> 58:01.510
Play something, and turn it way up.

58:02.010 --> 58:05.742
Something danceable.

58:07.350 --> 58:10.512
Up here?

58:11.020 --> 58:12.854
Are you serious?

58:12.855 --> 58:14.957
You're gonna teach me to dance up here?

58:14.958 --> 58:17.626
What? You want I should do it
in front of all the customers?

58:17.627 --> 58:18.627
What customers?

58:18.628 --> 58:20.596
Shut up. Come over here.

58:20.597 --> 58:23.498
Okay, get ready for the music.

58:23.499 --> 58:27.230
You feel it... here.

58:27.737 --> 58:30.472
Here it comes.

58:38.615 --> 58:41.249
Something a little less demonic, please!

58:44.087 --> 58:46.077
Thank you.

58:55.030 --> 58:56.665
Yes! Okay, okay, um, just-just follow

58:56.666 --> 58:57.833
whatever it is I'm doing, okay?

58:57.834 --> 58:58.834
- Step forward...
- All right.

58:58.835 --> 59:00.002
Step back.

59:00.003 --> 59:01.003
To your right.

59:02.505 --> 59:03.805
To your left.

59:03.806 --> 59:04.806
Turn to the right.

59:13.616 --> 59:14.783
Sit yourself down...

59:14.784 --> 59:16.451
Okay, you really do suck. Sit down.

59:16.452 --> 59:17.786
Told you.

59:17.787 --> 59:18.787
Just watch me, all right?

59:18.788 --> 59:20.856
A, B, C

59:20.857 --> 59:22.958
Easy as one, two, three

59:22.959 --> 59:25.127
As simple as do, re, mi

59:25.128 --> 59:27.462
A, B, C, one, two, three

59:27.463 --> 59:29.197
Baby, you and me, girl

01:01:09.866 --> 01:01:12.000
Whoo!

01:01:28.050 --> 01:01:29.050
I love you, Becky.

01:01:30.553 --> 01:01:32.020
I'm pregnant, Dante.

01:01:35.258 --> 01:01:36.747
Oh!

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.342
I'm having second thoughts.

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:57.379
About your sexuality?

01:01:57.380 --> 01:01:59.313
About going to Florida.

01:02:02.118 --> 01:02:03.285
Yeah, right.

01:02:03.286 --> 01:02:05.720
Why now, all of a sudden?

01:02:08.958 --> 01:02:11.426
Becky's pregnant.

01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:13.689
She is?

01:02:14.430 --> 01:02:16.298
Huh.

01:02:16.299 --> 01:02:18.567
So, what, are you afraid you're
gonna miss the baby shower?

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:20.535
I'm the father.

01:02:23.139 --> 01:02:24.806
This sucks, man.

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:27.943
I have pelvic piss syndrome like a motherfucker,

01:02:27.944 --> 01:02:31.242
so be really fucking quiet.

01:02:31.747 --> 01:02:34.215
Ew, dude, don't try looking at my dick.

01:02:35.218 --> 01:02:37.085
- What the fuck?
- What?

01:02:37.086 --> 01:02:38.486
Should we have left that guy in there?

01:02:38.487 --> 01:02:40.355
Oh, fuck him! How the fuck did you father a child

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:42.123
with a chick that's not your fiancé?!

01:02:42.124 --> 01:02:43.825
Holy shit!

01:02:43.826 --> 01:02:45.193
She got pregnant off the toilet seat

01:02:45.194 --> 01:02:46.361
you jerked off onto!

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:47.529
I fucking knew it!

01:02:47.530 --> 01:02:49.998
No, we had sex one night
after work, a few weeks ago.

01:02:49.999 --> 01:02:50.966
What?! Where?!

01:02:50.967 --> 01:02:52.868
Here, on the prep station table.

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.035
Ew! That's my prep table.

01:02:54.036 --> 01:02:55.036
I don't know what to do.

01:02:55.037 --> 01:02:56.037
What did Beck say?

01:02:56.038 --> 01:02:57.205
She says she wants to have it.

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:58.874
Oh, my God, so she wants you to break it off

01:02:58.875 --> 01:03:00.208
- with Emma and marry her?
- No.

01:03:00.209 --> 01:03:01.643
She's gonna tell Emma?

01:03:01.644 --> 01:03:02.644
No!

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.679
Wait a second... then what's the problem?

01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:06.882
- Are you that dense?
- I'm serious.

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:08.550
If Becks isn't busting your balls about it,

01:03:08.550 --> 01:03:09.551
what's the big deal?

01:03:09.552 --> 01:03:10.552
You could still go down to Florida

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:11.887
and live happily ever after.

01:03:11.888 --> 01:03:14.589
Knowing I have a love child up in Jersey?!

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:15.590
How the fuck do you always have,

01:03:15.590 --> 01:03:17.659
like, two good-looking girls who want you?

01:03:17.660 --> 01:03:19.694
You're the most hideous fucking CHUD

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:21.196
I've ever met, and you always have

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:22.864
a pair of girls fighting over you.

01:03:22.865 --> 01:03:24.866
Listen, you can never tell anybody about this.

01:03:24.867 --> 01:03:26.067
Who am I gonna tell?

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.702
I'm serious, Randal! And not just for me.

01:03:27.703 --> 01:03:29.371
Becky says she doesn't want anybody to know.

01:03:29.372 --> 01:03:30.372
Then what'd you tell me for?

01:03:30.373 --> 01:03:32.507
Look, you've fucked me over in the past,

01:03:32.508 --> 01:03:33.708
but this is huge.

01:03:33.709 --> 01:03:34.876
This is serious!

01:03:34.877 --> 01:03:37.212
Promise me that you'll keep your mouth shut,

01:03:37.213 --> 01:03:38.546
because if you fuck me over this time,

01:03:38.547 --> 01:03:41.049
I swear to God, I will beat the shit out of you.

01:03:41.050 --> 01:03:42.918
You and what army?

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:43.919
I'm serious!

01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.887
I'm serious, too. You and what army?

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.188
Promise me!

01:03:47.189 --> 01:03:49.424
All right! Get off of me, you nut!

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:52.325
What the fuck?!

01:03:56.799 --> 01:03:58.533
Can I talk to you for a minute?

01:03:58.534 --> 01:04:00.268
Oh, yeah, sure. Uh, we were just...

01:04:00.269 --> 01:04:02.828
May your first child be a masculine child.

01:04:08.610 --> 01:04:09.577
Becky!

01:04:09.578 --> 01:04:10.745
Randal!

01:04:10.746 --> 01:04:12.280
She was sweating me. It just came out.

01:04:12.280 --> 01:04:13.748
Ow! Shit!

01:04:13.749 --> 01:04:15.016
You swung at me!

01:04:15.017 --> 01:04:17.185
- You ducked!
- Because you swung at me!

01:04:17.186 --> 01:04:19.176
Damn it!

01:04:21.390 --> 01:04:22.724
Where's Becky?

01:04:22.725 --> 01:04:23.725
She just left.

01:04:23.726 --> 01:04:24.893
I need help here, Mr. Dante.

01:04:24.894 --> 01:04:27.228
I can't wrap good,
and Randal ate the last pickles.

01:04:27.229 --> 01:04:28.897
You fucking snitch.

01:04:28.898 --> 01:04:30.565
I'm sorry, Randal. I'm sorry.

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:33.728
Becky!

01:04:39.742 --> 01:04:41.943
Maybe she went to get a home pregnancy test

01:04:41.944 --> 01:04:42.944
just to be sure.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:46.437
How the fuck could this day get any worse?

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.119
Well, what the fuck are you doing, man?!

01:04:51.120 --> 01:04:52.120
Follow her!

01:04:52.120 --> 01:04:53.121
You-you think?

01:04:53.122 --> 01:04:54.122
You're darn right, I do.

01:04:54.123 --> 01:04:55.457
You two have got to work this out.

01:04:55.458 --> 01:04:56.624
Follow her, talk to her for an hour,

01:04:56.625 --> 01:04:57.625
then come back here.

01:04:57.626 --> 01:04:58.626
An hour?!

01:04:58.627 --> 01:05:00.395
I-I've found that any more time than that,

01:05:00.396 --> 01:05:02.297
you run the risk of saying the wrong thing again.

01:05:02.298 --> 01:05:03.965
Follow her, talk to her for an hour,

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.433
then come back here and help me close up.

01:05:05.434 --> 01:05:06.735
You can't close up by yourself?

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.803
Fucking A, man, you're about to become a father!

01:05:08.804 --> 01:05:10.805
Time to start acting responsibly!

01:05:10.806 --> 01:05:14.207
Be back here in an hour. Go!

01:05:33.629 --> 01:05:34.929
Hello.

01:05:34.930 --> 01:05:36.931
I assume you're with Kinky Kelly.

01:05:36.932 --> 01:05:39.401
Good guess. You Randal?

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.635
I am.

01:05:40.636 --> 01:05:41.970
How long is it gonna take you to set up?

01:05:41.970 --> 01:05:43.605
Got to hook up the boom box,

01:05:43.606 --> 01:05:45.306
hang a few curtains and some lights.

01:05:45.307 --> 01:05:47.842
I've got a small smoke machine for ambiance. Yeah.

01:05:47.843 --> 01:05:50.078
Well, you might as well start setting up.

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.079
We got about an hour

01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:52.647
before the guest of honor gets back.

01:05:52.648 --> 01:05:56.284
So, do I, uh, get to meet Kelly
before the show or what?

01:05:56.285 --> 01:05:57.118
Nah.

01:05:57.119 --> 01:05:58.953
Kelly likes privacy before show time.

01:05:58.954 --> 01:06:00.488
But after the show, if you want,

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.791
for an extra $500, you can fuck Kelly.

01:06:02.792 --> 01:06:04.759
Really? Sweet.

01:06:04.760 --> 01:06:07.095
Yeah. So, where we doing this thing?

01:06:07.096 --> 01:06:09.791
Oh, right inside the restaurant.

01:06:10.332 --> 01:06:11.499
You're kidding.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:13.735
Not spacious enough?

01:06:13.736 --> 01:06:15.637
No, it's plenty spacious.

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:17.405
Just kind of weird, isn't it?

01:06:17.406 --> 01:06:18.406
Kind of weird?

01:06:18.407 --> 01:06:20.742
You're in the bestiality business, dude.

01:06:20.743 --> 01:06:22.710
Hey, fucko...

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:23.912
...we like to call it

01:06:23.913 --> 01:06:25.780
inter-species erotica.

01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:28.078
Intriguing.

01:08:35.609 --> 01:08:37.812
Oh, no.

01:08:37.813 --> 01:08:39.279
Not again.

01:08:40.816 --> 01:08:42.483
Yeah, I have a fire at the Mooby's

01:08:42.484 --> 01:08:44.781
on Memorial Parkway and Leonardo.

01:08:57.966 --> 01:09:00.094
What?

01:09:03.305 --> 01:09:06.006
What the fuck is going on?

01:09:06.008 --> 01:09:07.575
It's your going-away party.

01:09:07.576 --> 01:09:10.245
Whoo! Whoo!

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:14.314
We's all gonna get drunk and get laid!

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:16.884
Oh, my God, is Elias hammered?

01:09:16.885 --> 01:09:17.885
Isn't it awesome?

01:09:17.886 --> 01:09:20.251
My man smoked two blunts full of skunk.

01:09:21.023 --> 01:09:22.023
Fuck Pillow Pants!

01:09:22.024 --> 01:09:24.192
Honk if you love a tight pussy...

01:09:24.193 --> 01:09:26.694
Yo, we love pussy.

01:09:26.694 --> 01:09:28.363
Tonight, before you leave me forever,

01:09:28.363 --> 01:09:30.365
we are gonna peep something
we've been talking about

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.866
since we saw "Bachelor Party"

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:34.202
at your parents' house on Beta,
when we were twelve.

01:09:34.203 --> 01:09:36.371
What the fuck are you talking about?

01:09:36.372 --> 01:09:38.038
I'm gonna miss you, man.

01:09:38.040 --> 01:09:41.542
I'm gonna miss you, too,
but this is a little much.

01:09:41.542 --> 01:09:43.772
Yeah? Just wait.

01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:54.281
Show time!

01:09:54.823 --> 01:09:56.557
Ladies and gentlemen...

01:09:56.558 --> 01:09:57.558
and you, Elias,

01:09:57.559 --> 01:09:59.527
straight from the debauchery

01:09:59.528 --> 01:10:02.697
capital of the world, Tijuana, Mexico...

01:10:02.698 --> 01:10:03.998
Oh, God, no.

01:10:03.999 --> 01:10:05.933
Oh, God, yes.

01:10:05.934 --> 01:10:08.870
Get ready for some hard-core bestiality.

01:10:08.870 --> 01:10:11.931
Inter-species erotica, fucko!

01:10:12.474 --> 01:10:15.009
Inter-species erotica at its finest,

01:10:15.010 --> 01:10:16.511
straight from TJ,

01:10:16.512 --> 01:10:21.005
I give you Kinky Kelly and the Sexy Stud!

01:10:38.200 --> 01:10:41.464
Don't worry. Chick's coming.

01:10:55.484 --> 01:10:57.352
Any second, the chick's coming.

01:11:10.466 --> 01:11:12.367
Any minute now.

01:11:28.684 --> 01:11:31.686
Wow, that guy's being awfully
forward with that donkey.

01:11:31.687 --> 01:11:33.187
Uh, Randal?!

01:11:33.188 --> 01:11:36.953
Where the fuck's the chick?

01:11:45.367 --> 01:11:48.136
Yo, Freddie fucking Mercury, where's Kelly?

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:50.304
Right here.

01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:54.142
I thought that's the sexy stud.

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:57.445
I'm the sexy stud.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.749
But this donkey's a dude.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:05.019
Kelly can be a guy's name, too. Hey!

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:16.030
Due to some nomenclature confusion,

01:12:16.030 --> 01:12:18.866
there's not gonna be any chick.

01:12:18.867 --> 01:12:21.402
Well, who the fuck's gonna blow the donkey?

01:12:32.214 --> 01:12:36.350
I have a huge boner right now.

01:12:38.554 --> 01:12:40.021
Oh, my God!

01:12:40.022 --> 01:12:42.390
Becky!

01:12:42.390 --> 01:12:43.558
Where did you go?

01:12:43.559 --> 01:12:45.726
What the fuck is going on here?

01:12:45.727 --> 01:12:48.062
Uh, inter-species erotica.

01:12:48.063 --> 01:12:49.831
Are you okay?

01:12:49.832 --> 01:12:53.668
I'm disgusted and repulsed and...

01:12:53.669 --> 01:12:55.670
and I can't look away.

01:12:57.840 --> 01:12:59.874
It's huge!

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.546
We need to talk.

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:07.682
Did you see the size of that cock...

01:13:07.683 --> 01:13:09.081
I love you.

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.552
And-and I think you love me, too.

01:13:14.022 --> 01:13:16.858
Uh, of-of course. I...

01:13:16.859 --> 01:13:18.059
I mean, we're friends.

01:13:18.060 --> 01:13:20.790
I-I think you love me as more than a friend.

01:13:22.764 --> 01:13:24.432
It's okay. You can say it.

01:13:24.433 --> 01:13:27.535
But I don't believe in romantic love.

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:29.628
I think you do.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.406
Do you really want to do this right now?

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:39.413
Well, I guess the show's over.

01:13:39.414 --> 01:13:40.915
I don't think so, sir.

01:13:50.993 --> 01:13:52.994
If he's gonna jerk off,

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:54.629
I'm gonna jerk off, too.

01:13:54.630 --> 01:13:57.325
I don't think he's gonna jerk off.

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.012
Yo, you guys are gonna miss this shit!

01:14:11.013 --> 01:14:15.516
The big guy's gonna cornhole
that ass... with his wiener!

01:14:15.517 --> 01:14:17.184
Hold that thought.

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:30.665
I hope that donkey doesn't have a heinie troll.

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.468
All right, I do.

01:14:34.469 --> 01:14:36.370
Do what?

01:14:39.308 --> 01:14:41.332
I do love you.

01:14:53.220 --> 01:14:55.756
What kind of sick fuck gets turned on

01:14:55.757 --> 01:14:57.758
watching a guy fuck a donkey?

01:15:04.266 --> 01:15:07.234
I'm sorry, Jesus.

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.168
Dante?

01:15:29.390 --> 01:15:31.692
What's going on?

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:33.854
Ooh, cake.

01:15:34.896 --> 01:15:37.698
Yo, I was outside taking
a piss when I heard the news.

01:15:37.699 --> 01:15:39.188
Congrats!

01:15:40.902 --> 01:15:42.835
You're having a baby, right?

01:15:44.606 --> 01:15:48.303
No. Who said that?

01:15:50.178 --> 01:15:52.839
Some asshole.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.090
I'm sorry.

01:16:06.695 --> 01:16:08.628
You fuck!

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:13.390
Quick, hit that two-timing fuck with this!

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:19.332
Hey, want to go out sometime?

01:16:24.312 --> 01:16:26.939
Emma, I don't... I don't know what to say.

01:16:27.482 --> 01:16:30.382
Take him, you fucking whore.

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.112
Emma!

01:16:39.628 --> 01:16:41.829
Oh, no.

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.231
Oh, shit, not again. Got to finish.

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:57.144
Yo, cops are outside, we're holding,

01:16:57.145 --> 01:17:00.375
and I'm still on probation.

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:07.678
What the fuck?

01:17:11.259 --> 01:17:12.793
Porch monkey?!

01:17:12.794 --> 01:17:14.361
Oh, no, no, it's cool.

01:17:14.362 --> 01:17:16.124
I'm taking it back.

01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:20.668
I love pussy and beer!

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:22.158
Whoo-hoo!

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:36.212
Deja fucking vu, right?

01:17:46.228 --> 01:17:50.164
Jail cell design hasn't changed
much in centuries, has it?

01:17:50.932 --> 01:17:52.967
Maybe it's time they brought in
the laser bars or something.

01:17:52.968 --> 01:17:54.435
Or they can make

01:17:54.436 --> 01:17:58.172
a hard plastic cage like Magneto's in X-Men 2.

01:17:58.173 --> 01:17:59.507
No, come on, dude,

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.942
let's keep it in the real world, all right?

01:18:02.710 --> 01:18:04.145
But you know what wouldn't be a bad idea?

01:18:04.146 --> 01:18:05.840
Carbonite.

01:18:08.550 --> 01:18:10.278
What do you think, Dante?

01:18:11.153 --> 01:18:12.186
I think I'm gonna kill you!

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.721
Get off of me!

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.723
What up?! Steel cage match!

01:18:15.724 --> 01:18:16.891
You ruined my life!

01:18:16.892 --> 01:18:18.859
Your life was already ruined!

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.961
Jesus!

01:18:20.962 --> 01:18:22.196
What were you thinking?

01:18:22.197 --> 01:18:23.497
A fucking donkey show?!

01:18:23.498 --> 01:18:25.166
It was your going-away present!

01:18:25.167 --> 01:18:26.200
It sure was.

01:18:26.200 --> 01:18:27.701
I just never thought
I'd be going away to prison.

01:18:27.702 --> 01:18:29.931
Hey, boys.

01:18:30.472 --> 01:18:31.872
You can't be imprisoned

01:18:31.873 --> 01:18:34.141
for watching an inter-species sex act.

01:18:34.142 --> 01:18:35.843
You guys'll walk.

01:18:35.844 --> 01:18:38.212
The most I'll get'll be a fine for animal abuse

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:41.549
and a lot of disgusted looks
from asswipe conservatives

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:44.051
who can't appreciate sexual exploration.

01:18:44.052 --> 01:18:45.746
Hey!

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:52.692
I miss my donkey.

01:18:53.228 --> 01:18:54.829
I can't believe you.

01:18:54.830 --> 01:18:56.597
I finally get my shit together.

01:18:56.598 --> 01:18:58.098
I'm hours from getting out of here

01:18:58.099 --> 01:19:00.935
and really starting my life,
and you somehow figure out a way

01:19:00.936 --> 01:19:03.470
to obliterate all that
and reduce me to a convict.

01:19:03.470 --> 01:19:05.940
Oh, yeah, it's my fault your life's fucked up.

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:08.739
I'm the engaged guy who knocked up my boss.

01:19:09.277 --> 01:19:12.613
You knocked up the guy who owns Mooby's? Ew.

01:19:12.614 --> 01:19:13.747
What?

01:19:13.748 --> 01:19:15.044
Would you shut up?

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:18.419
You're chaos incarnate, man.

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.620
Our whole lives,

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:22.156
you've been getting me into
trouble and holding me back.

01:19:22.157 --> 01:19:23.624
Oh, I'm holding you back, right?

01:19:23.625 --> 01:19:25.192
I remember, like, ten years ago,

01:19:25.193 --> 01:19:27.127
the night we went to Julie Dwyer's funeral,

01:19:27.128 --> 01:19:29.697
you were all like, "I need
to shit or get off the pot."

01:19:29.698 --> 01:19:31.866
You said, "Shit or get off the pot," not me.

01:19:31.867 --> 01:19:34.468
You got all fired up about
taking charge of your life,

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:35.636
and what'd you do?

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:38.138
You worked at the store
till the place burned down.

01:19:38.139 --> 01:19:39.573
I took courses at Brookdale.

01:19:39.574 --> 01:19:40.541
And dropped out.

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:42.009
Because you stopped going.

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:44.845
Because we were just killing
time with those classes.

01:19:44.846 --> 01:19:46.113
One semester,

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.815
we took Criminology, for Christ's sake.

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:50.050
What the fuck were we training to be, Batman?

01:19:50.050 --> 01:19:52.386
At least we were doing something

01:19:52.387 --> 01:19:55.155
instead of wasting our lives in
some fucking convenience store!

01:19:55.156 --> 01:19:56.490
You know what?

01:19:56.490 --> 01:19:59.493
You can badmouth Quick Stop all
you want, but I miss that place.

01:19:59.494 --> 01:20:00.661
I loved working there.

01:20:00.662 --> 01:20:03.630
I look back on that period
as the best time in my life.

01:20:04.165 --> 01:20:05.666
Now I know you're fuckin' nuts.

01:20:05.667 --> 01:20:08.836
Why? Because I enjoyed what I did?

01:20:08.837 --> 01:20:10.404
I got to watch movies,

01:20:10.405 --> 01:20:12.840
fuck with assholes,
and hang out with my best friend

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:14.008
all day.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.342
Can you think of a better way to make a living?

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:17.344
Yeah, maybe it's not what everyone does,

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.506
but it was pretty fucking good.

01:20:20.048 --> 01:20:21.682
Man, that's you all over.

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:23.317
Scrape by with the bare minimum.

01:20:23.318 --> 01:20:25.753
Well, I'm tired of that, Randal.

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:27.354
I'm not in high school anymore.

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.690
Shit, I'm not even in my twenties anymore.

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:31.525
I don't want to sit around and rag on customers

01:20:31.526 --> 01:20:32.693
while eating free food.

01:20:32.694 --> 01:20:33.894
That's what you want to do.

01:20:33.895 --> 01:20:35.829
That's what you've always wanted to do.

01:20:35.830 --> 01:20:38.032
Well, if that's all you want out
of life, man, then God bless,

01:20:38.033 --> 01:20:40.901
but I refuse to let your shit
taint the rest of mine.

01:20:40.902 --> 01:20:44.038
No. I'm gonna smooth things over with Emma,

01:20:44.039 --> 01:20:45.439
go to Florida

01:20:45.440 --> 01:20:49.000
and start my Randal Graves-free existence.

01:20:50.345 --> 01:20:55.179
And try to forget these last
thirty-three years ever happened.

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:04.454
So that's the way you see all
this time we've spent together?

01:21:06.294 --> 01:21:08.162
That's weird, man.

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:10.164
I thought you were the only guy in the world

01:21:10.165 --> 01:21:12.066
who got me and had my back...

01:21:12.067 --> 01:21:15.169
the only person who'd take a bullet for me,

01:21:15.170 --> 01:21:16.670
'cause I assumed you felt about me

01:21:16.670 --> 01:21:19.540
the same way I feel about you.

01:21:19.540 --> 01:21:22.042
Then, all of a sudden, one day,
you're like, "I'm moving. Bye."

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:25.671
Do you know what that's been like for me?

01:21:26.414 --> 01:21:28.182
I'm looking at a future that just sucks,

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.184
because you're not gonna be in it anymore.

01:21:30.185 --> 01:21:31.685
And you're not even throwing me over

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.520
for a life that means something to you.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.522
It's just a stupid, hollow existence

01:21:35.523 --> 01:21:36.523
you think you should embrace

01:21:36.524 --> 01:21:37.925
because you're getting old or something,

01:21:37.926 --> 01:21:43.030
because it's the kind of life
everyone else goes after.

01:21:43.030 --> 01:21:45.699
You're a fucking drone, dude.

01:21:45.700 --> 01:21:46.700
Fine.

01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:48.369
Then the next friend whose life you ruin

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:50.304
can be a totally free spirit.

01:21:50.305 --> 01:21:51.438
How's that?

01:21:51.439 --> 01:21:55.142
You think I want to start
making friends at my age?

01:21:55.143 --> 01:21:57.144
Christ.

01:21:57.145 --> 01:21:59.636
Who would want me as their friend?

01:22:00.315 --> 01:22:04.307
I hate everyone, and everything
seems stupid to me...

01:22:06.520 --> 01:22:09.490
...but you were always
the counterbalance to that...

01:22:09.490 --> 01:22:13.827
the guy who was the yin to my yang.

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:17.820
But now what the fuck am I gonna
do for the rest of my life?

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:21.635
I mean, shit, I really wish

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.137
you would've told me this
when I first met you

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.471
that one day, you were gonna bail

01:22:24.472 --> 01:22:25.806
on our friendship,

01:22:25.807 --> 01:22:27.808
because if I had known
you were just gonna flake on me

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:31.478
a few decades later...

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.147
I wouldn't have even bothered with your ass

01:22:33.148 --> 01:22:35.878
in the first place.

01:22:38.119 --> 01:22:39.319
Jesus, why don't you two

01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:41.981
just fuck and get it over with already?

01:22:43.425 --> 01:22:44.591
Faggots.

01:22:44.592 --> 01:22:48.926
Why can't you ever say
something useful for a change?

01:22:49.464 --> 01:22:50.764
Well, what the fuck you waiting for?

01:22:50.765 --> 01:22:53.597
That's your cue, man.

01:23:03.778 --> 01:23:05.939
I got nothing.

01:23:07.315 --> 01:23:08.615
Jesus fucking Christ, what good are you,

01:23:08.616 --> 01:23:09.783
you mute fuck?!

01:23:09.784 --> 01:23:11.318
You know what? That hurts.

01:23:11.319 --> 01:23:13.887
Like, what do you ever add
to the fucking proceedings?

01:23:13.888 --> 01:23:16.723
You got, like, one answer
for everything: "Pussy, man."

01:23:16.724 --> 01:23:19.293
Oh, then, man, you must love this fuckin' guy,

01:23:19.294 --> 01:23:21.261
'cause he's the biggest pussy I ever met.

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:22.796
The dude who lives his life

01:23:22.797 --> 01:23:24.064
according to everyone else's standards.

01:23:24.065 --> 01:23:25.899
"I got to go to Florida

01:23:25.900 --> 01:23:28.302
and get married, 'cause
that's what's expected of me."

01:23:28.303 --> 01:23:30.971
And the fuckin' insane part is,
he ain't even that crazy

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:33.273
about the chick he's marrying or Florida,

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:34.475
never mind the fact that he's got

01:23:34.476 --> 01:23:35.476
a perfectly good chick

01:23:35.477 --> 01:23:38.145
right here in Jersey who he's nuts about,

01:23:38.146 --> 01:23:41.315
and even Anne fuckin' Frank
could see she's nuts about him.

01:23:41.316 --> 01:23:42.983
God knows why.

01:23:42.984 --> 01:23:45.152
And she likes you for who you are, man.

01:23:45.153 --> 01:23:46.987
She ain't trying to stuff you into a box

01:23:46.988 --> 01:23:48.489
you'll never fit into.

01:23:48.490 --> 01:23:50.090
Not to mention the fact that she's carrying

01:23:50.090 --> 01:23:52.252
your hideous fucking CHUD of a kid.

01:23:53.060 --> 01:23:54.595
Jesus, if you had any sense whatsoever,

01:23:54.596 --> 01:23:55.929
you'd fuckin' stop trying

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.598
to bray it up with the rest of the sheep

01:23:57.599 --> 01:24:00.434
and live your life the way it makes sense for you,

01:24:00.435 --> 01:24:01.835
you fuckin' ass!

01:24:01.836 --> 01:24:03.837
Oh, yeah? And what's that?

01:24:03.838 --> 01:24:05.139
You obviously have such a great handle

01:24:05.140 --> 01:24:06.440
on your life.

01:24:06.440 --> 01:24:08.108
Tell me what you would do
if you were in my position...

01:24:08.109 --> 01:24:10.410
or even what you'd do in your own position?

01:24:10.410 --> 01:24:12.946
Swing that judgmental pendulum back the other way

01:24:12.947 --> 01:24:14.748
and tell me how you'd solve
all your problems, asshole.

01:24:14.749 --> 01:24:16.850
What the fuck would the
great Randal Graves do

01:24:16.850 --> 01:24:18.285
if he were half the master of his destiny

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:19.753
that I'm supposed to be?!

01:24:19.754 --> 01:24:24.418
I'd buy the Quick Stop and reopen it myself!

01:24:25.827 --> 01:24:27.761
That's what I'd do.

01:24:27.762 --> 01:24:30.856
That's what we should do.

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:32.900
Yeah, right.

01:24:32.900 --> 01:24:35.602
Who-who are we, Lance Dowds?

01:24:35.603 --> 01:24:37.404
Do you know how much it would cost

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:38.405
to buy the Quick Stop?

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:40.140
Like, fifty grand, easy.

01:24:40.140 --> 01:24:44.133
And neither one of us have that type of money.

01:24:50.718 --> 01:24:53.709
We do.

01:24:57.592 --> 01:25:00.322
That's right.

01:25:01.062 --> 01:25:03.564
You guys would be willing
to lend us some of that money

01:25:03.565 --> 01:25:05.589
so we can reopen the stores?

01:25:08.403 --> 01:25:11.071
Sure, on two conditions.

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:13.240
One: We can hang out in front of the store

01:25:13.240 --> 01:25:15.504
anytime we want, and you can't call the cops.

01:25:16.244 --> 01:25:18.111
And two:

01:25:18.112 --> 01:25:19.913
You have to blow each other,

01:25:19.914 --> 01:25:21.403
and we get to watch.

01:25:21.883 --> 01:25:24.908
Then you have to go ass to mouth.

01:25:27.889 --> 01:25:31.256
All right, just the first condition.

01:25:31.793 --> 01:25:33.060
Seriously?

01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.061
Do I stutter?

01:25:34.062 --> 01:25:36.530
Yeah, seriously.

01:25:40.668 --> 01:25:42.931
What do you think?

01:25:43.972 --> 01:25:46.974
I almost hate to say it, but...

01:25:46.975 --> 01:25:49.443
it kind of makes sense.

01:25:50.110 --> 01:25:53.113
Hey, maybe that's why we spent
so much time in that store,

01:25:53.114 --> 01:25:54.615
why college

01:25:54.616 --> 01:25:57.150
or anything else never panned out for us.

01:25:57.150 --> 01:25:58.719
I mean, think about it, man.

01:25:58.720 --> 01:26:00.254
You and me running our own business

01:26:00.255 --> 01:26:03.417
instead of working for some other asshole?

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:07.017
Could be pretty fuckin' sweet, right?

01:26:08.429 --> 01:26:11.420
Yeah, it really could.

01:26:16.270 --> 01:26:17.838
But I don't know, man.

01:26:17.839 --> 01:26:21.604
I was this close to starting a new life.

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:23.905
Jesus.

01:26:25.146 --> 01:26:28.308
You're actually gonna make
me do this, aren't you?

01:26:31.719 --> 01:26:35.518
Can you guys cover your
ears for a minute, please?

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:48.201
You're my best friend...

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:50.567
and I love you.

01:26:51.839 --> 01:26:55.008
In a totally heterosexual way.

01:26:55.009 --> 01:26:57.841
Yeah, right.

01:26:59.213 --> 01:27:03.308
Please, man, don't leave me.

01:27:07.622 --> 01:27:09.953
Thanks.

01:27:15.797 --> 01:27:18.128
That'll be $5.79.

01:27:28.042 --> 01:27:31.136
I mean, you already taught me
how to dance at a wedding.

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:35.512
I mean... I know you
don't believe in romantic love.

01:27:48.763 --> 01:27:51.231
Is that a yes?

01:27:51.232 --> 01:27:54.401
What took you so long?

01:28:06.647 --> 01:28:10.050
"One ring to rule them all."

01:28:51.659 --> 01:28:53.193
Come on!

01:30:21.349 --> 01:30:24.079
Oh!

01:30:26.854 --> 01:30:29.618
- Thanks.
- Okay.

01:30:30.458 --> 01:30:32.926
Pack of cigarettes?

01:30:38.666 --> 01:30:40.667
- You know what?
- What?

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:43.500
You're not even supposed to be here today.

01:30:45.339 --> 01:30:48.341
Can you feel it?

01:30:48.342 --> 01:30:50.043
Feel what?

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:53.604
Today is the first day of the rest of our lives.
