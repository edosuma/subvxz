the "The Practice"...

00:03.020 --> 00:04.150
- What say you?

00:04.150 --> 00:06.210
- We find the defendant,
Anderson Pearson, guilty.

00:06.210 --> 00:08.109
WOMAN: No!

00:08.109 --> 00:10.120
JUDGE PATTERSON: It is not
evident on the record

00:10.120 --> 00:13.010
that Judge Hiller actually
ruled in this matter,

00:13.010 --> 00:15.110
thereby prohibiting
self-defense.

00:15.110 --> 00:17.120
The conviction of
Anderson Pearson, therefore,

00:17.120 --> 00:19.060
stands.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.110
- We screwed up by not appealing
Judge Hiller's ruling.

00:21.110 --> 00:23.000
That's what cost us that appeal.

00:23.000 --> 00:25.010
It was malpractice!

00:25.010 --> 00:26.120

for murder.

00:26.120 --> 00:27.200
A kid you know
didn't commit murder--

00:27.200 --> 00:29.120

00:29.120 --> 00:32.020
At best, your boy saw
a 15-year-old girl

00:32.020 --> 00:34.070

and went for a walk.

00:34.070 --> 00:35.210
At worst, he killed her.

00:35.210 --> 00:38.030
Either case, I have no problem
putting him away.

00:38.030 --> 00:41.150

Kevin Peete, guilty as charged.

00:41.150 --> 00:43.110

00:43.110 --> 00:46.100
You got your conviction,
but for the wrong guy.

00:46.100 --> 00:48.070
MCKREW: Boyfriend bludgeoned
the babysitter.

00:48.070 --> 00:51.110
We already did one lineup
but we want to run it again.

00:51.110 --> 00:53.170
- Why?
- 'Cause this is the witness.

00:53.170 --> 00:55.120
- He's four years old.

00:55.120 --> 00:57.230
- Every defendant has a right
to confront his own accuser.

00:57.230 --> 01:00.140
Without the four year old,
a killer walks.

01:00.140 --> 01:01.230
- I'm not going to allow it.

01:01.230 --> 01:03.200
- I'm afraid you have no choice.

01:03.200 --> 01:06.130
- I'm his mother
and I'm gonna protect him

01:06.130 --> 01:08.000

01:08.000 --> 01:09.120
- This case is dismissed.

01:09.120 --> 01:11.060
The defendant is free to go.

01:11.060 --> 01:13.060
- No!

01:13.060 --> 01:14.230

I'm convinced they got

01:14.230 --> 01:17.100

and if they do,

01:17.100 --> 01:19.060

01:20.130 --> 01:22.020

01:33.010 --> 01:34.130

They're both choirboys.

01:34.130 --> 01:35.160

no official alibi

01:35.160 --> 01:37.040

01:37.040 --> 01:38.200
Why not plan B them?

01:38.200 --> 01:41.030
- It might be worth a try.
- Give them a soft plan B.

01:41.030 --> 01:43.060
- Plan B, soft, for both.

01:43.060 --> 01:45.050

and frame George Vogelman?

01:45.050 --> 01:46.200
TISBURY: Objection!
- What?

01:46.200 --> 01:48.070
- Did you follow her to the bar
then go to the motel?

01:48.070 --> 01:49.070
TISBURY: Objection!
- That's sick!

02:03.000 --> 02:04.060
If he says he's sorry--
- He said he's sorry.

- Who, Clinton?

02:05.130 --> 02:07.060

02:07.060 --> 02:08.199
Hiller goes for contrition.

02:08.199 --> 02:10.009
I'd actually rehearse him.

02:10.009 --> 02:11.120
A good show of remorse

02:11.120 --> 02:14.100
can be the difference
between 18 and life.

02:14.100 --> 02:17.130

02:17.130 --> 02:20.100
- Thinking what?

02:20.100 --> 02:22.060
- I'm gonna ask her to reduce
the charge to manslaughter.

02:22.060 --> 02:23.140
- What?

02:23.140 --> 02:24.140
LINDSAY: That's what it
really was.

02:24.140 --> 02:26.060
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

02:26.060 --> 02:27.200
- They convicted him of murder
because manslaughter

02:27.200 --> 02:29.090
wasn't unavailable,
not because it wasn't--

02:29.090 --> 02:30.210

didn't even investigate

would screw things up,

17:34.170 --> 17:36.190

18:33.080 --> 18:35.000
Did I miss something?

18:35.000 --> 18:38.090

an affirmative defense?

18:38.090 --> 18:39.230

be told, Your Honor,

to even read the brief?

18:45.100 --> 18:47.010
- I don't need to read
the brief.

18:47.010 --> 18:48.230
All I had to do
was look at the letterhead

18:48.230 --> 18:51.080
and see your firm's name
attached to it.

18:52.130 --> 18:54.010
- What's that supposed to mean?

18:54.010 --> 18:58.010
- It means
all you people do is stunt.

18:58.010 --> 19:00.140
You argue jury nullification
every chance you get

19:00.140 --> 19:02.020
or moral duress--

19:02.020 --> 19:03.020
- We didn't.

19:03.020 --> 19:04.090
- In this one,

19:04.090 --> 19:06.090
you came in claiming
self-defense,

19:06.090 --> 19:08.110
then you switch
to involuntary act--

19:08.110 --> 19:10.130
- It's called a zealous defense,

19:10.130 --> 19:12.090
which every client
is entitled to.

19:12.090 --> 19:15.110
- Was it a zealous defense
last week

19:15.110 --> 19:17.220
when Eugene Young
stood up in court

19:17.220 --> 19:21.040
and accused the victim's own
brother of killing her?

19:21.040 --> 19:23.030
- That case has nothing
to do with this.

19:23.030 --> 19:27.120
- It has everything to do with
who and what your firm is.

19:27.120 --> 19:30.040
You even blindsided
Helen Gamble,

19:30.040 --> 19:31.130
calling her to the stand.

19:31.130 --> 19:34.050

19:34.050 --> 19:37.100

19:37.100 --> 19:40.210
So when you walk in here
after a verdict

19:40.210 --> 19:43.070
with yet another
of your little tricks,

19:43.070 --> 19:46.000
don't expect me to give you

19:46.000 --> 19:47.180
the benefit of the doubt!

19:49.030 --> 19:51.160
- I expect you to read
the brief!

19:51.160 --> 19:53.180
I expect you not to punish
a criminal defendant

19:53.180 --> 19:55.190
just because
you don't like the lawyers!

19:55.190 --> 19:57.120
I expect you to rule
without letting

19:57.120 --> 19:58.220
your own personal feelings
get in the way--

19:58.220 --> 19:59.220
- You should've thought
of that--

19:59.220 --> 20:01.060
- Let me finish!

20:01.060 --> 20:02.060
- I don't have
to let you finish.

20:02.060 --> 20:03.060
I am the judge!

20:03.060 --> 20:04.190
- Then act like one!

20:04.190 --> 20:06.000
You're angry at Lindsay Dole

20:06.000 --> 20:07.020
because she got
the appeals court

20:07.020 --> 20:08.020
to say you were wrong!

20:08.020 --> 20:09.070
- It isn't about that!

20:09.070 --> 20:11.050
- Not to mention
stubborn to admit.

20:11.050 --> 20:12.130
- Get out of this room!

20:12.130 --> 20:13.140
- You used to be about fairness.

20:13.140 --> 20:15.100
Now you're all about ego.

20:15.100 --> 20:16.220
You're not the judge I used
to respect, that I do know.

20:16.220 --> 20:18.060
- Keep talking.
Keep talking.

20:18.060 --> 20:19.060
- What I don't know
is what happened

20:19.060 --> 20:20.200
to make you so embitter.

20:20.200 --> 20:23.100
As an officer of the court,
I hold you in contempt!

20:38.050 --> 20:39.230
- What time did you get out?
- 10:00.

20:39.230 --> 20:41.210
- I thought this was a judge
you were on good terms with.

20:41.210 --> 20:43.010
- So did I.

20:43.010 --> 20:45.030
Where are we on Robbins?

20:45.030 --> 20:46.050

20:46.050 --> 20:47.170

20:47.170 --> 20:50.160

a much bigger problem.

20:57.190 --> 20:59.090

a supervening act.

20:59.090 --> 21:01.010
- They can't do that.
It happened in court.

21:01.010 --> 21:02.190
We're getting sued
for what happened in court?

21:02.190 --> 21:04.140
- All I'm telling you
is what they're telling me.

21:04.140 --> 21:05.200
- So if we lose,
it's $30 million

21:05.200 --> 21:07.030
out of your own pockets?

21:07.030 --> 21:08.150

would be kicked.

21:11.030 --> 21:12.120

21:12.120 --> 21:13.160
We don't need this kind
of publicity.

21:13.160 --> 21:15.000

21:15.000 --> 21:16.000
- Back in again today
on sentencing.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.170
I'd like to stay on it.

21:17.170 --> 21:19.050
- Well, she's probably
more angry at me now anyway.

21:19.050 --> 21:21.080
Can you keep it under control?
- I promise.

21:21.080 --> 21:23.150
- And on sentencing,
don't be going for manslaughter.

21:23.150 --> 21:24.220

- Yes.

21:53.070 --> 21:55.010

21:55.010 --> 21:57.030

21:57.030 --> 22:00.190
and pointing to the television

22:00.190 --> 22:02.200
That's the man who killed Cindy.

22:02.200 --> 22:04.060
- Ms. Walsh,

22:04.060 --> 22:06.120
the night after Cindy Harrelson
was killed,

22:06.120 --> 22:08.070
did you accompany your son,
Danny,

22:08.070 --> 22:09.190
to the police lineup?

22:09.190 --> 22:11.050
- Yes, I did.

22:11.050 --> 22:13.070
- And was he able
to identify the person

22:13.070 --> 22:14.200
who killed Cindy Harrelson?

22:14.200 --> 22:18.050
- Yes, he pointed to that man,
right there.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.110
- Thank you.

22:21.110 --> 22:22.190
That's all I have.

22:22.190 --> 22:24.130
- You may step down, Ms. Walsh.

22:24.130 --> 22:26.020

22:26.020 --> 22:28.170
that Ms. Walsh's entire
testimony be stricken.

22:28.170 --> 22:30.110
It's all hearsay.

22:30.110 --> 22:34.020
- Testimony regarding the police
lineup is arguably hearsay,

22:34.020 --> 22:37.080
I admit, but as for what
the boy saw on television,

22:37.080 --> 22:40.060
what he then said,
that's admissible.

22:40.060 --> 22:42.090
- Oh, come on.
HELEN: Excited utterances.

22:42.090 --> 22:45.220
Ms. Walsh testified that her son
was crying and became

22:45.220 --> 22:48.120

Mr. Parrish's face

22:48.120 --> 22:49.120
on television.

22:49.120 --> 22:51.100
While in that excited state,

22:51.100 --> 22:53.130
he identified Parrish
as the killer.

22:53.130 --> 22:55.020
- This is legal gamesmanship.

22:55.020 --> 22:57.150
- Rules of evidence
aren't gamesmanship.

22:57.150 --> 23:00.110
The court now has before it
admissible testimony

23:00.110 --> 23:02.020
identifying James Parrish

23:02.020 --> 23:04.110
as the person
who killed Cindy Harrelson.

23:04.110 --> 23:06.080

from taking the stand,

23:08.060 --> 23:11.060
which denies my client the right
to confront his accuser.

23:11.060 --> 23:13.210
- Your Honor, the accuser
for the purpose of this hearing

23:13.210 --> 23:15.000
is Janet Walsh.

23:15.000 --> 23:17.010

Here I am.

27:48.040 --> 27:49.120
What now?

27:49.120 --> 27:57.120
♪ ♪

27:57.120 --> 27:59.070
- Okay.

27:59.070 --> 28:00.230
Round two.

28:00.230 --> 28:03.020
I'll hear from the defense.

28:06.030 --> 28:08.000
- Your Honor,

28:08.000 --> 28:09.200
I'd like to make
a brief statement,

28:09.200 --> 28:12.030
then I'd like you to hear
from Anderson Pearson himself,

28:12.030 --> 28:14.080
followed by three
character witnesses.

28:14.080 --> 28:16.110
First, let me begin--

28:22.100 --> 28:24.120
- Ms. Dole?

28:24.120 --> 28:26.200
- I apologize, Your Honor.

28:29.000 --> 28:32.190
My client has instructed me to
address you on sentencing only,

28:32.190 --> 28:35.080
but as an officer of the court,
I feel duty bound to protect

28:35.080 --> 28:36.210
the integrity of this process,

28:36.210 --> 28:38.040
and insofar as I feel,

28:38.040 --> 28:39.200
the prosecution's refusal

28:39.200 --> 28:41.140
to offer manslaughter
in the alternative--

28:41.140 --> 28:43.050
- Your Honor.
- Ms. Dole!

28:43.050 --> 28:45.110
- And I also know
Your Honor's unwillingness

28:45.110 --> 28:46.120
to reopen this discussion,

28:46.120 --> 28:48.010
but with all due respect,

28:48.010 --> 28:50.060
I would like to raise this issue
here to preserve--

28:50.060 --> 28:51.180
JUDGE HILLER: You did raise it!

28:51.180 --> 28:53.190
I denied it!
The record--

28:53.190 --> 28:57.020
- I'd like to renew it
and ask for ten minutes.

28:57.020 --> 28:58.180
That's all.
Ten minutes.

28:58.180 --> 29:01.090
If you conclude that
I have wasted the court's time,

29:01.090 --> 29:03.020
I will go right to my cell.

29:03.020 --> 29:06.070
- You are pushing this court!

29:06.070 --> 29:08.010
- I understand that.

29:13.030 --> 29:15.080
- 10:00 tomorrow morning.

29:15.080 --> 29:18.010
Bring your toothbrush.

29:20.020 --> 29:21.150
- That was completely
out of line!

29:21.150 --> 29:23.050
- Stop yelling at me!
- No, I won't stop!

29:23.050 --> 29:24.120
You are playing games
with your client's life!

29:24.120 --> 29:26.010
- I was careful
to stay respectful!

29:26.010 --> 29:27.160
I don't think
I risked alienating her anymore!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.070
- What are you doing, Lindsay?
What are you doing?

29:29.070 --> 29:30.140
- We lost it, Bobby!
We lost that man's case--

29:30.140 --> 29:32.030
- We didn't lose it!

29:32.030 --> 29:33.100
- He might forgive us,
but I can't just give up

29:33.100 --> 29:34.210
because it's one last chance!

29:34.210 --> 29:36.140
- He shoot him five times!

29:36.140 --> 29:39.010
- It's one last chance!
- What if she gives him life?

29:40.030 --> 29:41.190
- I kept it under control.

29:41.190 --> 29:43.210
I will keep it under control
tomorrow.

29:46.150 --> 29:51.030
- I know what Meredith Pearson
said today hurt.

29:51.030 --> 29:53.110
It hurt me too,

29:53.110 --> 29:56.120
but that was an emotional wife.

29:59.190 --> 30:03.100
Lindsay, we've done everything
we can do for this man.

30:03.100 --> 30:05.030
He is a good man.

30:05.030 --> 30:07.190
It's unthinkable for him
to live out his life in prison,

30:07.190 --> 30:10.210
but he did pull that trigger.

30:12.000 --> 30:13.230
That's why he's in jail.

30:15.200 --> 30:17.200
Not because of you or me.

30:20.070 --> 30:21.150
- I'm sorry.

30:21.150 --> 30:24.130
I just--

30:24.130 --> 30:27.000
in my mind,
I have to know

30:27.000 --> 30:29.050
that I tried everything.

30:34.070 --> 30:36.210
- So am I gonna wear a wire
or something?

30:36.210 --> 30:39.130
- No, you're being used
as a police agent,

30:39.130 --> 30:41.030
which means
when you talk to him

30:41.030 --> 30:43.230
it would be an interrogation
outside of counsel.

30:43.230 --> 30:46.040
They don't want
any record of it.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.160
- So what happens?

30:47.160 --> 30:49.020
- They'll put him in a cell
next to you

30:49.020 --> 30:51.010
with the hopes you two talk,

30:51.010 --> 30:52.090
and if you come up
with something

30:52.090 --> 30:54.080
they can use against him--
if you d--

30:54.080 --> 30:56.070
there's a chance you could
get out of jail one day.

30:56.070 --> 30:57.210
A chance.

30:57.210 --> 31:00.160
All Helen Gamble can do
is make a recommendation.

31:00.160 --> 31:02.150
Nothing's guaranteed.

31:04.200 --> 31:06.190
- Okay, when are they
moving him in?

31:06.190 --> 31:09.010
- I'm told he'll be there
when you get back,

31:09.010 --> 31:12.060
but since you're scheduled for
transfer by the end of the week,

31:12.060 --> 31:14.170
you got to make fast work
of it.

31:14.170 --> 31:16.020
- Yeah, okay.

31:16.020 --> 31:17.200
- And Kevin,

31:17.200 --> 31:19.230
you can't tell anybody
about this conversation,

31:19.230 --> 31:22.100
not even your folks,
because if it comes out,

31:22.100 --> 31:25.090
your testimony is inadmissible,
then the deal is off.

31:26.110 --> 31:27.200
- Okay.

31:27.200 --> 31:28.230
- We'll talk tomorrow--
- Yeah, okay.

31:44.210 --> 31:46.170
- I couldn't really get him
to say much.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.040
- What did he say?

31:48.040 --> 31:49.180
- Mainly that they'd never
nail him.

31:49.180 --> 31:51.060
You know, his other lawyer
told him all they had

31:51.060 --> 31:52.160
was a four-year-old witness.

31:52.160 --> 31:54.230
- Did he ever
admit to killing the girl?

31:54.230 --> 31:56.130
- Not exactly.

31:56.130 --> 31:58.020
- Not exactly?

31:58.020 --> 31:59.100
- Look, I said to him,
"You did it, didn't you?

31:59.100 --> 32:01.020
You killed her,"

32:01.020 --> 32:03.070
and he sort of smiled
a little bit and said nothing,

32:03.070 --> 32:05.010
and that's when I said,
"Aren't you scared?"

32:05.010 --> 32:07.040
I told him how there was
this public pressure to get me.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.110
You know, "Aren't you scared
they'll get you?"

32:09.110 --> 32:11.150
And that's when he said it.

32:11.150 --> 32:14.120
- "They'll never get me, not
with a four-year-old witness."

32:14.120 --> 32:16.060
- I need more than that.
EUGENE: Maybe not.

32:16.060 --> 32:17.220
You've got an implied admission.

32:17.220 --> 32:19.230
Kevin said you did it,
the Parrish kid said nothing.

32:19.230 --> 32:21.000
- Yeah, but how--

32:21.000 --> 32:22.080
- Silence in the face

32:22.080 --> 32:24.070
of an adverse accusation.

32:24.070 --> 32:27.040
That's an implied admission
of guilt, admissible.

32:27.040 --> 32:28.170
- I need something stronger.

32:30.180 --> 32:33.120
- Here's your problem.

32:33.120 --> 32:35.180
Kevin Peete is scheduled
for transfer tomorrow.

32:35.180 --> 32:37.070
If suddenly he isn't transferred

32:37.070 --> 32:39.090
and then comes up
with a confession from Parrish,

32:39.090 --> 32:41.010
it's gonna look suspicious.

32:41.010 --> 32:43.150
If you then go moving to reduce
Kevin Peete's charge

32:43.150 --> 32:46.090
from first-degree to murder two,
they'll figure this out.

32:46.090 --> 32:48.140
It's dicey enough as it is.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.080
I say go
with what you've got now.

32:50.080 --> 32:52.090
The fact that it's not
an outright confession

32:52.090 --> 32:54.100
draws less attention.

32:54.100 --> 32:57.030
Make your play now.

33:00.010 --> 33:02.030
LINDSAY: When Anderson Pearson
pulled that trigger,

33:02.030 --> 33:03.200
it wasn't self-defense.

33:03.200 --> 33:07.050
He shot an unarmed man
five times,

33:07.050 --> 33:09.040
and when we said we wanted
to argue self-defense,

33:09.040 --> 33:10.150
you quickly said no

33:10.150 --> 33:12.090
because as a guardian
of the court,

33:12.090 --> 33:15.010
you were not about to allow
tricky lawyer-ing to distort

33:15.010 --> 33:17.060
what you knew to be the truth,

33:17.060 --> 33:20.110
and standing before you,
I'll admit,

33:20.110 --> 33:23.170
we were guilty of exactly what
you accused us of, Your Honor.

33:23.170 --> 33:25.180
We were figuring
Anderson's Pearson's a good man,

33:25.180 --> 33:27.100
the defendant's a bad guy.

33:27.100 --> 33:29.180
All we have
to do is present self-defense

33:29.180 --> 33:32.230
and at least one juror
would bite.

33:32.230 --> 33:34.100
You were right,

33:34.100 --> 33:37.010
but the prosecution
had its own strategy.

33:37.010 --> 33:38.170
They didn't want
to charge manslaughter

33:38.170 --> 33:41.060
because they were figuring
that same sympathetic jury

33:41.060 --> 33:45.010
would choose that to avoid
sending a good man away forever,

33:45.010 --> 33:47.230
so they box them in with
murder one or murder two.

33:47.230 --> 33:50.130
These games
are played every single day

33:50.130 --> 33:52.020
by defense attorneys
and prosecutors

33:52.020 --> 33:54.050
in courtrooms
all across the country.

33:54.050 --> 33:55.230
- Yes, it's awful, isn't it?

33:55.230 --> 33:57.190
Except when you win.

33:57.190 --> 34:00.150
- The problem is you let them
play their hand, but with us--

34:00.150 --> 34:03.000
- Because murder one
and murder two were tenable.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.090
Self-defense wasn't.

34:04.090 --> 34:06.000
- That's a finding of fact,
not--

34:06.000 --> 34:09.060
- No, it's a conclusion
of law based on the facts.

34:09.060 --> 34:11.150
- Your Honor, you wouldn't
let us distort the truth.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.219
You shouldn't either.

34:12.219 --> 34:15.150
Your ruling
was a finding of fact.

34:15.150 --> 34:16.219
- Should I put on my helmet?

34:16.219 --> 34:18.050
Are you about
to throw your brief?

34:18.050 --> 34:19.050
LINDSAY: You shut down
self-defense

34:19.050 --> 34:20.120
because it wasn't that,

34:20.120 --> 34:22.010
but this wasn't
murder two either.

34:22.010 --> 34:24.050
It was an act
in the heat of passion.

34:24.050 --> 34:28.010
The man showed up at his door
with a dead cat.

34:28.010 --> 34:31.020
After a month of stalking,
he arrives at the doorway,

34:31.020 --> 34:35.030
throws down the family pet,
which he had just strangled,

34:35.030 --> 34:38.179
and Anderson Pearson snapped.

34:38.179 --> 34:40.030
It was manslaughter.

34:40.030 --> 34:42.060
- So why didn't you ask
for an order

34:42.060 --> 34:46.020
that manslaughter be charged
as a lesser included defense?

34:46.020 --> 34:47.110
I'll tell you.

34:47.110 --> 34:49.080
You feared,
just like the prosecutors,

34:49.080 --> 34:51.219
that if it was available,
the jury would up for it,

34:51.219 --> 34:53.139
and just like the prosecution,

34:53.139 --> 34:56.090
you wanted to play
all or nothing.

34:56.090 --> 34:57.200
- Ask yourself
what really happened.

34:57.200 --> 34:59.100
- Why should I?
This is--

34:59.100 --> 35:00.170
- Because that's what you did
when we wanted

35:00.170 --> 35:02.020
to go self-defense.

35:02.020 --> 35:04.030
You said to yourself,
"What really happened?"

35:04.030 --> 35:05.170
And you took over.
Fine, do it again.

35:05.170 --> 35:07.090
- Counsel!

35:07.090 --> 35:08.230
LINDSAY: Forgot about poker
and games and lawyers.

35:08.230 --> 35:11.210
Just look at the case
and call it as you see it!

35:11.210 --> 35:12.220
You did it in the beginning!

35:12.220 --> 35:14.140
You owe it to Anderson Pearson--

35:14.140 --> 35:16.210
- I don't owe anybody!
- You know what happened!

35:16.210 --> 35:18.180
You know what happened!
You know what happened!

35:18.180 --> 35:20.040
JUDGE HILLER: Sit down,
Ms. Dole.

35:20.040 --> 35:22.090
LINDSAY: You know what happened!
- Ms. Dole!

35:23.110 --> 35:25.020
- You know what happened.

35:28.170 --> 35:30.180
- $2 million,
we walk away clean.

35:30.180 --> 35:32.050
Up front,
nothing structured.

35:32.050 --> 35:33.090
- We're not gonna cut you
a check, Tommy.

35:33.090 --> 35:34.200
Is why you're here?

35:34.200 --> 35:36.110
- Yeah, Ellenor,
that's why I'm here,

35:36.110 --> 35:38.040
and here's why
you're gonna consider it.

35:38.040 --> 35:39.190
I'm willing
to drop the defamation,

35:39.190 --> 35:41.040
plus the intentional accounts,

35:41.040 --> 35:42.220
settle everything
under negligent claims,

35:42.220 --> 35:44.180
which means you'll be covered
by your policy.

35:44.180 --> 35:47.010
It's not your money,
just your carrier's.

35:47.010 --> 35:48.130
- But you don't think
they'll see through that?

35:48.130 --> 35:49.230
- Oh, I'm sure they will,

35:49.230 --> 35:51.050
but my bet is they'll
settle anyway

35:51.050 --> 35:53.060
because the exposure
here is too big.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.210
I can paint a pretty
disgusting picture

35:54.210 --> 35:56.190
of you guys
in front of a jury.

35:56.190 --> 35:59.120
Team Plan B?

35:59.120 --> 36:02.030
You can convince your carrier
that $2 million is cheap,

36:02.030 --> 36:04.120
and you have incentive
to do so

36:04.120 --> 36:07.040
because if that judgment
exceeds your policy limit,

36:07.040 --> 36:10.120
well, this nice conference table
will be mine,

36:10.120 --> 36:11.100
and it will be.

36:13.150 --> 36:16.000
- Well, in the spirit
of a settlement discussion,

36:16.000 --> 36:18.010
which is of course,
off the record,

36:18.010 --> 36:19.120
let me tell you something.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.140
We gave it about half a thought,
tops,

36:21.140 --> 36:22.220
before going after
the Robin kid.

36:22.220 --> 36:23.220
You know why?

36:23.220 --> 36:25.180
We don't like to lose.

36:25.180 --> 36:27.220
We're every bit as despicable
and cutthroat as you say,

36:27.220 --> 36:29.120
which you better think about

36:29.120 --> 36:31.130
because we will fight you
in the very same way.

36:33.110 --> 36:35.020
- I look forward to that.

36:35.020 --> 36:36.180
- Good.

36:36.180 --> 36:38.200
Because a lawyer
suing another lawyer,

36:38.200 --> 36:41.060
in this town, you're gonna look
like the bad guy,

36:41.060 --> 36:43.040
and when we're finished
with you, Tommy,

36:43.040 --> 36:45.020
you will be the bad guy.

36:45.020 --> 36:47.110
You forgot to ask
what's gonna happen to you.

36:47.110 --> 36:49.160
- These are your scare tactics?

36:49.160 --> 36:51.160
- Look at her record, Tommy.

36:51.160 --> 36:53.030
We win,

36:53.030 --> 36:56.190
