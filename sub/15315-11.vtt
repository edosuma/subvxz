00:13.400 --> 00:16.200
We'll go no further unless I know I can trust you.

00:16.239 --> 00:19.560
I can't just betray the others and bring you to the camp.

00:19.600 --> 00:21.840
You can trust me.

00:21.880 --> 00:25.320
Just don't ask me to forgive your father.

00:25.360 --> 00:27.800
Now, you listen to me, Gisborne.

00:27.840 --> 00:31.920
If we're gonna work together,
then we have to leave that behind.

00:33.360 --> 00:34.800
That's easy for you to say.

00:34.840 --> 00:37.760
Your father seduced my mother.

00:37.800 --> 00:39.960
Well, it didn't take much effort, did it?

01:09.080 --> 01:11.400
Everyone, quick, hurry!

01:13.120 --> 01:15.240
Robin's in trouble!

01:15.280 --> 01:17.480
Hey! Robin's fighting Gisborne over the hill.

01:17.520 --> 01:19.960
I don't know who else is there. Come on. Come on!

01:28.200 --> 01:30.520
You kill my wife and you expect forgiveness?!

01:30.560 --> 01:31.840
I loved her as you loved her.

01:36.360 --> 01:39.200
I'll never ask for your forgiveness.

01:43.320 --> 01:45.080
I can't forgive myself.

01:45.120 --> 01:45.800
What?

01:55.120 --> 01:56.840
Get back!

01:58.880 --> 02:01.600
Get off me!

02:01.640 --> 02:03.120
No!

02:03.160 --> 02:05.200
He killed my brother!

02:05.920 --> 02:08.880
He's oneof us.What?

02:08.919 --> 02:11.160
I said, "He's one of us!"

02:14.760 --> 02:16.360
Aagh!

02:59.040 --> 03:01.000
So that's where you've been, then, with him?!

03:01.040 --> 03:03.840
I've been with my father, John.

03:03.880 --> 03:05.640
I thought your father was dead.

03:05.680 --> 03:09.080
So did I. He's not one of us, Robin. And he never will be!

03:09.120 --> 03:12.280
Gisborne has chosen to join us in our struggle, John.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.120
You can't trust him!

03:15.160 --> 03:16.800
He killed the Sheriff.

03:16.840 --> 03:20.160
And we're almost family, aren't we, Robin?

03:21.200 --> 03:22.200
We share a brother.

03:22.240 --> 03:24.360
What?! A brother?

03:26.440 --> 03:27.480
Both of you?

03:27.520 --> 03:30.920
My father...

03:30.960 --> 03:31.960
his mother.

03:33.480 --> 03:35.120
Our brother is in jail in York,

03:35.160 --> 03:37.440
awaiting execution,

03:37.480 --> 03:42.600
and I promised my dying father... and I intend to honour it.

03:42.640 --> 03:45.040
Me and Gisborne will go to York and bring him back.

03:45.080 --> 03:48.120
If it were any of you, you know I'd do the same.

03:48.160 --> 03:50.720
And who'll bring my brother back to me, Robin?

03:50.760 --> 03:52.120
No-one stopped his execution.

03:52.160 --> 03:56.280
Look, like it or not, we share a common goal... 

03:56.320 --> 03:58.240
to destroy Isabella.

03:58.280 --> 04:01.280
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.

04:01.320 --> 04:03.720
You don't have to like me.

04:03.760 --> 04:05.200
I don't like you.

04:05.240 --> 04:07.240
But you need me.

04:07.280 --> 04:08.360
We don't need you.

04:08.400 --> 04:10.080
If he can help rid us of Isabella...

04:10.120 --> 04:14.800
He's pure evil! Robin?! Do you
still believe good conquers evil?

04:14.840 --> 04:16.360
You need me to defeat Isabella

04:16.399 --> 04:18.440
and to do that we need our brother in York.

04:18.480 --> 04:19.600
Who is this brother, Robin?

04:19.640 --> 04:21.160
His name is Archer.

04:21.200 --> 04:23.360
We've never met.

04:24.600 --> 04:27.123
All I know is he's travelled far and wide and has a

04:27.124 --> 04:29.840
knowledge of exotic weapons
brought back from the East.

04:29.880 --> 04:31.920
Isabella's forces are far greater than ours.

04:31.960 --> 04:35.040
Archer's weapons will make us stronger.

04:35.080 --> 04:39.680
We all go.
And who will protect the people from Isabella?

04:39.720 --> 04:42.880
Well, who's gonna protect you?
Much, I'll be safe.

04:42.920 --> 04:45.400
No-one is gonna recognise me and Gisborne in York.

04:47.240 --> 04:48.800
I'll be back soon.

04:55.440 --> 04:57.000
Kate...

05:00.920 --> 05:03.960
you know I wish I could bring your brother back.

05:05.920 --> 05:07.680
Just...

05:07.720 --> 05:09.200
just don't trust him, Robin.

05:09.240 --> 05:11.000
I have to trust him.

05:12.400 --> 05:15.520
And you have to trust me that I'm doing the right thing.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.840
Come back to me safely.

05:20.440 --> 05:22.160
I will.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.720
Archer, it's time.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.760
God have mercy on you.

06:02.760 --> 06:05.320
Rest in peace.

06:19.360 --> 06:21.040
Is there any news on my brother?

06:21.080 --> 06:22.400
No, Sheriff.

06:22.440 --> 06:23.880
And nothing on Hood?

06:23.920 --> 06:25.960
No. This is Lipscomb, Sheriff.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.920
He collects the toll for you from
the Great North Road.Thank you.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.360
Your loyalties will be rewarded, I assure you.

06:33.400 --> 06:37.200
And if you hear or see anything,
you report to me immediately.

06:37.240 --> 06:40.320
Hood and his men are spreading
terror throughout Nottingham.

06:40.360 --> 06:44.680
Your help in finding them keeps us all safe. Here.

06:47.280 --> 06:51.400
Let's hope this Judas does better
than the last one I paid for.

06:51.440 --> 06:54.080
I want them found.

07:08.200 --> 07:11.000
You are glorious, Gweneth.

07:11.040 --> 07:12.480
Am I?

07:12.520 --> 07:14.520
I'm not sure my husband would agree.

07:14.560 --> 07:17.320
The Sheriff of York is a fool

07:17.360 --> 07:22.240
to neglect such a passionate, beautiful woman.

07:22.280 --> 07:24.800
Yes, well, I don't like to complain

07:24.840 --> 07:28.440
but sometimes I just feel so under-appreciated.

07:29.640 --> 07:32.640
Well, shall we do something about that?

07:41.840 --> 07:43.280
Tollhouse.

07:43.320 --> 07:46.000
It's not worth the risk.

07:46.040 --> 07:48.360
Well, they collect money for Isabella.

07:48.400 --> 07:51.280
Robbing them is robbing her.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.080
Don't... move.

08:04.960 --> 08:07.000
Is that everything?

08:07.040 --> 08:08.120
Let's go.

08:08.160 --> 08:10.720
Stay on your knees.

08:19.480 --> 08:22.400
I really must go to the dungeon
before your husband comes back.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.600
Yes, the Sheriff would be very upset.

08:24.640 --> 08:26.520
Yes, he would.

08:26.560 --> 08:28.760
He is the most powerful man in York.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.280
Yes, he is.

08:30.320 --> 08:33.760
And if you're as fond of me as I am of you...

08:33.799 --> 08:36.159
You know how fond I am of you.

08:36.200 --> 08:39.600
Then perhaps you might speak to
him about not hanging me next week.

08:41.240 --> 08:42.960
You can tell him that I fully intend

08:43.000 --> 08:45.280
to deliver the weapons his cousin paid for.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.880
It's all a big mistake.

08:48.640 --> 08:52.040
I'm completely innocent. You
heard the part about the hanging?

08:52.080 --> 08:53.560
Yes, of course.

08:53.600 --> 08:55.040
Then if you find a good moment,

08:55.080 --> 08:59.600
you might want to suggest some sort of, um... pardon.

09:01.640 --> 09:03.080
And I will show him one of the mysteries of the Orient.

09:03.120 --> 09:06.160
Hmm! Like the one you showed me?

09:06.200 --> 09:08.360
Not quite the same one.

09:09.520 --> 09:15.440
You see, this is the mystery of how
something glittering and precious,

09:15.480 --> 09:16.920
like you...

09:18.440 --> 09:19.920
can be made out of base metal.

09:21.760 --> 09:23.560
The alchemist's art...

09:25.000 --> 09:26.440
of making gold.

09:32.600 --> 09:34.560
Ever since I've known you...

09:35.760 --> 09:39.360
you make me feel so... alive.

09:39.400 --> 09:43.720
And it would be a shame if anything were to happen to me

09:43.760 --> 09:48.040
that might interfere with that... alive feeling.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.960
Mmm! By the way...

09:55.000 --> 09:57.560
you didn't happen to bring any food with you, did you?

09:57.600 --> 10:01.040
It was a big success with the other lads last time.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.200
Thank you, my good man.

10:10.040 --> 10:12.360
You said they were gonna kill ya.

10:12.400 --> 10:13.680
Probably next time.

10:13.720 --> 10:15.240
You said that last time.

10:17.960 --> 10:19.160
Hungry?

10:21.560 --> 10:23.480
I'll take offers.

10:23.520 --> 10:29.320
I'll give you 10 gold coins for that sausage.

10:29.360 --> 10:31.880
I accept.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.520
Good as gold.

10:46.000 --> 10:47.000
Eat up, lads!

10:47.040 --> 10:49.080
Enjoy the fruits of my labour.

10:49.120 --> 10:52.960
And you are certain he saw my
brother and Robin Hood together?

10:53.000 --> 10:54.680
Yes, Sheriff.
Together?

10:54.720 --> 10:57.600
They hate each other. Why
would they be working together?

10:57.640 --> 10:59.960
Huh?

11:01.560 --> 11:04.800
Two men who hate each other
can only be brought together

11:04.840 --> 11:07.880
by a shared hatred greater than their own.

11:07.920 --> 11:11.640
W... what? And you said they were on their way to York?

11:11.680 --> 11:12.680
Yes, Sheriff.

11:12.720 --> 11:14.720
York? But then why York?

11:14.760 --> 11:16.960
To what purpose are they working together?

11:17.000 --> 11:19.160
Do you think they're plotting against me?

11:19.200 --> 11:20.800
I know nothing more, Sheriff.

11:24.120 --> 11:28.360
Then you must go to York immediately, as my emissary.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.640
I'll assemble soldiers and I will follow you.

11:32.360 --> 11:34.680
Go to the Sheriff of York.

11:34.720 --> 11:39.160
Warn him that two murderous
scoundrels are fouling his domain -

11:39.200 --> 11:40.760
Guy of Gisborne and Robin Hood.

11:40.800 --> 11:42.720
Tell him...

11:42.760 --> 11:47.280
I will offer 100 crowns for their heads... each.

11:49.000 --> 11:50.440
Alive.

11:53.080 --> 11:55.480
Oh, yes.

11:55.520 --> 11:57.840
I want them alive.

12:20.680 --> 12:22.600
Left turn!

12:22.640 --> 12:25.240
And at ease!

12:25.280 --> 12:26.760
He's inside there.

12:26.800 --> 12:28.720
Well, it can't be that difficult.

12:28.760 --> 12:30.440
Can it?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.880
Robin working with Gisborne could help us.

12:35.920 --> 12:38.120
It will show the power of Robin Hood

12:38.160 --> 12:39.840
and the nobility of our cause

12:39.880 --> 12:42.840
that it can change his enemy into his friend.Show who?

12:42.880 --> 12:45.640
The people of Locksley hate him.
The people of Nottingham hate him.

12:45.680 --> 12:47.240
Everyone hates him.

12:47.280 --> 12:50.440
Robin doesn't seem to care about
the crimes Gisborne's committed.

12:50.480 --> 12:51.920
He's bringing us Gisborne

12:51.960 --> 12:54.120
and he's bringing us his brother to fight alongside.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.320
We are striving not just to protect Nottingham, but England -

12:58.360 --> 12:59.960
not to settle old scores, John.

13:00.000 --> 13:03.960
It's not about settling scores, Tuck. It's about justice!

13:04.000 --> 13:08.480
If Robin feels he can work with Gisborne...
Then Robin is wrong!

13:08.520 --> 13:13.160
We fight to protect people from animals like Gisborne.

13:14.920 --> 13:18.200
Kate's brother was murdered by Gisborne

13:18.240 --> 13:20.200
and he hasn't been punished!

13:20.240 --> 13:21.720
And I'm prepared to trust Robin.

13:21.760 --> 13:23.520
What?

13:25.960 --> 13:30.080
If he can bring Gisborne into our
forest and call him one of us...

13:35.960 --> 13:37.920
Hey, John... John?

13:53.800 --> 13:57.040
Is this petty thief the one you mean?Yes, Harold.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.520
With all due respect, Sheriff,

13:58.560 --> 14:03.320
I have to object to the use of the word "petty"... Oof!

14:03.360 --> 14:05.080
Go ahead and use it if you like.

14:05.120 --> 14:07.400
I know you.

14:07.440 --> 14:09.840
You're the one who took money from my cousin

14:09.880 --> 14:14.800
but never delivered the weapons
he purchased.A misunderstanding.

14:14.840 --> 14:17.600
He brings back mysteries from the Orient, Harold.

14:17.640 --> 14:18.720
More than one.

14:18.760 --> 14:21.480
What kind of mysteries?

14:21.520 --> 14:24.800
Alchemy.Ah! You have the power of alchemy?

14:24.840 --> 14:28.080
It's not a power, my lord. It's a science.

14:29.960 --> 14:32.040
A science of the East.

14:33.880 --> 14:37.640
But what it can do... brings power.

14:40.480 --> 14:42.440
Where's John?

14:43.480 --> 14:45.920
Is he not back yet?
No.

14:45.960 --> 14:47.920
Right. I'll find him.

14:49.840 --> 14:51.080
Do we have the nail?

15:03.760 --> 15:05.320
Harold.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.760
M'lady.

15:26.840 --> 15:29.360
Now, this can only be the
smallest of demonstrations,

15:29.400 --> 15:33.840
due to the limited amount of
magic powder I have.Of course.

15:55.640 --> 15:57.800
I told you.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
You can make more gold?

16:01.040 --> 16:02.720
Not if I'm a prisoner.

16:12.120 --> 16:14.000
Sir, have a look at this.

16:24.440 --> 16:26.040
As far as I know, yep.

16:26.080 --> 16:30.080
I'm doing the rounds again in
five minutes, so I'll check them.

16:32.600 --> 16:36.160
The place is heavily fortified... guards on every entrance.
I know.

16:36.200 --> 16:38.680
I think the only way in is to get invited.

16:38.720 --> 16:41.120
Even if we are, how do we get into the dungeon?

16:44.920 --> 16:49.720
It's a bit insulting he doesn't trust me
to come back with the powder on my own.

16:51.280 --> 16:53.520
Why don't you just shut up?!

17:00.240 --> 17:01.880
He was right not to trust me.

17:01.920 --> 17:06.200
Archer... I was rather hoping you'd take me with you.

17:06.240 --> 17:09.720
Oh, Gweneth,I am so grateful for
everything you've done for me.

17:09.760 --> 17:11.240
Are you sure...?

17:11.280 --> 17:14.280
But I think we should try to resist each other, don't you?

17:14.319 --> 17:15.839
Lock the gates!

17:15.880 --> 17:17.280
Archer, quick! Here.

17:20.760 --> 17:22.599
We'll be safe in here.

17:29.320 --> 17:32.440
Gweneth?! It's not real gold. The man's a fraud.

17:35.240 --> 17:36.360
No.

17:37.960 --> 17:39.720
Oh, no, Gweneth.

17:39.760 --> 17:41.480
How could you?

17:44.120 --> 17:47.800
I understand why you were so
desperate to have him pardoned.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.680
I loved you so much.

17:53.960 --> 17:57.160
Take them both to the dungeon...

17:58.320 --> 18:00.960
and prepare them to be put to death.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.440
How could you do this to me?

18:07.480 --> 18:08.800
She didn't.

18:08.840 --> 18:10.720
It was my fault.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.960
I forced her into the bedchamber and she resisted.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.440
My lord, she fought me off

18:17.480 --> 18:20.600
and then you entered and, like
the coward I am, I tried to hide.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.360
And I beg your for...

18:23.400 --> 18:24.920
forgiveness.

18:31.360 --> 18:33.400
It's true.

18:35.280 --> 18:37.240
Of course it is.

18:39.000 --> 18:42.480
I... never doubted you for one moment.

18:50.720 --> 18:54.000
I sentence this fraud to be put to death tomorrow.

18:54.040 --> 18:58.800
He will be boiled in oil before
his head is removed from his body

18:58.840 --> 19:02.280
and his entrails, as well as another part of his body,

19:02.320 --> 19:04.720
are fed to the pigs.

19:04.760 --> 19:06.200
I don't suppose there's any...

19:06.240 --> 19:07.560
Take him away.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.640
John?!

19:19.680 --> 19:21.920
Come on.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.720
Hey?

19:24.760 --> 19:26.240
John?

19:26.280 --> 19:29.760
What are you doing? I've been
looking everywhere for you. John?

19:29.800 --> 19:32.200
I don't want company. Hey, come back.

19:33.960 --> 19:36.400
Robin betrayed us!

19:37.720 --> 19:39.960
Bringing... Gisborne!

19:45.240 --> 19:47.040
Leave me be.

19:47.080 --> 19:49.400
Leave... me... be.

19:49.440 --> 19:50.600
I am.

19:50.640 --> 19:52.480
Then why are you walking beside me?

19:52.520 --> 19:54.600
Maybe we're going to the same place, eh?

19:54.640 --> 19:56.680
Maybe we are. You still don't need to walk beside me.

19:56.720 --> 19:58.520
There are many roads to the same place, Allan.

19:58.560 --> 19:59.640
Yes, there are.

20:00.680 --> 20:02.680
We all believe the same things, John.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.640
Yeah, well, I don't know that
I do. Well, I know we do, eh?

20:06.720 --> 20:08.440
I know we need you around, all right?

20:08.480 --> 20:11.120
To remind us who it is we're fighting for here.

20:11.160 --> 20:13.560
All right? We're lost without you.

20:15.720 --> 20:17.440
No. Go... away!

20:39.120 --> 20:40.280
After him!

20:40.320 --> 20:42.320
Ya! Ya!

20:54.160 --> 20:56.840
So, tell me, where were you going, John?

20:56.880 --> 20:59.960
To your camp... or to York?

21:02.000 --> 21:03.800
I'll deal with him when I get back.

21:03.840 --> 21:06.840
Take him to the castle and lock him up.Yeah, on your feet.

21:09.920 --> 21:12.160
So we've got two fairly difficult problems... 

21:12.200 --> 21:13.960
one, we don't know what he looks like.

21:15.320 --> 21:17.440
We'll recognise him by his birthmark.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.480
Don't worry. We'll find him when we get there.

21:20.520 --> 21:22.000
Which brings us to problem two.

21:22.040 --> 21:23.040
Enough! That's it!

21:34.880 --> 21:38.000
I think I have a... I have a plan.

21:38.040 --> 21:39.480
I'm listening.Aagh!

21:39.520 --> 21:41.760
You, er... you get arrested,

21:41.800 --> 21:45.280
get taken to the dungeon, find Archer and then...

21:46.280 --> 21:49.320
I'll bribe the guards, I'll come and see you.
And then what?

21:49.360 --> 21:50.920
And then we escape. How?

21:50.960 --> 21:53.880
Well, I haven't worked that out yet, have I?

21:58.120 --> 22:00.400
Forget it. It'll never work. Why not?

22:00.440 --> 22:03.120
Because I'm not getting arrested. Why not?

22:03.160 --> 22:07.000
You'll leave me in the dungeon.
I will not. You have my word.

22:08.600 --> 22:10.320
You see, that's where this falls down.

22:10.360 --> 22:12.960
Well, all right. I'll get myself arrested then.

22:13.000 --> 22:16.840
That sounds like a better plan.
And you come and get me out.

22:18.800 --> 22:20.720
See? Suddenly it's not such a good idea, is it?

22:20.760 --> 22:25.280
You know, I'm not sure if I trust you yet.

22:25.320 --> 22:26.680
But we're about to find out.

22:30.760 --> 22:32.480
Good luck.

22:35.400 --> 22:37.400
Do you think that's funny?

22:39.040 --> 22:41.520
Right! Get off me! Get off me!

22:43.280 --> 22:44.680
Get off me!

23:03.600 --> 23:05.200
You!

23:05.240 --> 23:07.400
My leg! Get up now! My leg's gone.

23:07.440 --> 23:09.240
You'll have to carry me. My leg.

23:09.280 --> 23:11.240
On your feet, I said!

23:11.280 --> 23:14.800
My leg's gone. Get up! All right, all right, all right!

23:17.920 --> 23:19.120
Hey!

23:35.960 --> 23:39.760
What are you doing?
I was just gonna finish him off.

23:39.800 --> 23:44.720
Yeah. I saw. What are you doing?
Risking your life, no weapons?

23:44.760 --> 23:46.480
I was just saving you.

23:46.520 --> 23:48.000
You're a fool.

23:48.040 --> 23:50.600
Ha! Maybe but I had no choice.

23:52.160 --> 23:54.000
Hey, I'm your family, right?

23:55.240 --> 23:57.360
Yeah, you are.

23:57.400 --> 23:59.880
Right. Horses!

23:59.920 --> 24:03.200
No. Isabella. She's on her way to York.

24:03.240 --> 24:05.080
We need to get the others. Come on.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.480
In you go! Ugh!

24:12.760 --> 24:14.840
Get off me! Get... get off me!

24:16.560 --> 24:17.560
Get off!

24:18.760 --> 24:21.720
I'll kill the next man that touches me.

24:23.680 --> 24:25.320
Kill me.

24:25.360 --> 24:26.840
Please.

24:27.880 --> 24:29.680
Put me out of me misery.

24:29.720 --> 24:31.760
No.

24:31.800 --> 24:34.280
You didn't bring any food, did you?

24:37.920 --> 24:38.920
Hey.

24:40.000 --> 24:44.560
Robin's in trouble. Isabella's on
her way to York with her guards.

24:44.600 --> 24:46.760
She must know Robin and Gisborne are there.

24:46.800 --> 24:48.760
Why else would she go?
Yeah.

24:48.800 --> 24:50.520
We'll stop her before she gets to York.

24:50.560 --> 24:52.120
We'll have to cut across the forest then,

24:52.160 --> 24:53.720
try and get on the York road ahead of her.

24:53.760 --> 24:54.760
Well, let's go.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.120
He's family.

25:00.760 --> 25:02.520
I'm glad you came back, John.

25:06.920 --> 25:12.520
I'm looking for a man called
Archer. Heard of him?Might have. Why?

25:12.560 --> 25:13.680
He's my brother.

25:13.720 --> 25:15.120
Brother?Yeah.

25:15.160 --> 25:19.080
I've come to help him escape
from this godforsaken place.

25:19.120 --> 25:20.240
Escape? Shh.

25:22.600 --> 25:25.840
Well, I haven't come alone.
You ever heard of Robin Hood?

25:27.000 --> 25:28.000
Brother.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.120
You're my brother?

25:30.160 --> 25:31.600
Prison ages a man.

25:31.640 --> 25:34.440
No, you can't be Archer. Who says?

25:34.480 --> 25:38.520
I'm Archer.
I'm Archer.

25:38.560 --> 25:40.280
Great No, I'm Archer.

25:40.320 --> 25:42.320
I'm Archer.
I'm Archer.

25:42.360 --> 25:43.880
Quiet!
I'm Archer.

25:45.520 --> 25:48.200
I'm Archer.

25:51.280 --> 25:53.120
Who's your father?

25:53.160 --> 25:54.600
I don't know.

25:56.040 --> 25:57.760
And I don't care.

25:58.800 --> 26:02.120
Your mother?
She died when I was a baby.

26:02.160 --> 26:05.480
I was given away. I was told you have a birthmark.

26:14.400 --> 26:15.680
You're my brother.

26:15.720 --> 26:17.040
Who are you?

26:17.080 --> 26:21.880
Guy of Gisborne.Well, that's a very expensive sounding name.

26:21.920 --> 26:23.760
I've come to get you out of here.

26:24.840 --> 26:26.120
How?

26:30.320 --> 26:33.840
Pleasure doing business with you. Thank you.

26:52.960 --> 26:54.680
Who are you?

27:05.840 --> 27:10.560
Well, the truth is Gisborne just... had a bit too much to drink.

27:10.600 --> 27:14.120
And for that, I am sure he's profoundly sorry.

27:14.160 --> 27:17.680
An assault on one of the Sheriff's
men is an assault on the Sheriff.

27:17.720 --> 27:19.320
Oh, believe me, I know.

27:21.360 --> 27:23.360
Would this be enough to...

27:23.400 --> 27:26.880
salve the indignity of this terrible assault?

27:29.400 --> 27:32.120
It is but a faint memory now, sir.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.680
I thank you for your... sympathy.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.960
Escort this gentleman to the dungeon

27:39.000 --> 27:42.320
so that he may collect his malfeasant friend.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.920
Thank you very much.

27:47.560 --> 27:51.280
An emissary from the Sheriff of Nottingham.

27:58.200 --> 28:00.280
Come on! We must hurry.

28:02.120 --> 28:03.960
Come on!

28:22.600 --> 28:24.920
Gisborne! Visitor.

28:29.040 --> 28:33.080
He's over here.We have to hurry.
One of Isabella's men is here.

28:41.720 --> 28:42.760
Brother.

28:42.800 --> 28:45.800
All of a sudden, I have so many brothers.

28:48.440 --> 28:49.880
Who are you?

28:49.920 --> 28:50.960
I'm Robin Hood.

28:51.000 --> 28:52.600
Really?

28:53.880 --> 28:55.360
Robin Hood really exists?

28:56.760 --> 28:58.880
Just... stay here.

29:01.440 --> 29:03.080
How much to take him with us?

29:03.120 --> 29:05.040
How much do you have?

29:13.360 --> 29:15.000
How about that?

29:15.040 --> 29:17.760
Er... nah.

29:17.800 --> 29:22.240
He's meant to die tomorrow and I think the
Sheriff was, you know, looking forward to it.

29:22.280 --> 29:23.800
Of course he is.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.960
I'll have to leave York.
Missus won't be happy.

29:30.000 --> 29:31.800
Yeah, the missus. All right.

29:33.240 --> 29:35.440
Right.

29:36.760 --> 29:38.720
Nah, I'm sorry. Can't help you.

29:41.640 --> 29:45.840
Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne...

29:45.880 --> 29:48.880
they're both dangerous criminals.

29:48.920 --> 29:50.840
Gisborne?

29:53.680 --> 29:54.680
Gisborne?

29:54.720 --> 29:57.240
Gisborne.

29:57.280 --> 29:58.840
We need to go.

30:00.360 --> 30:02.160
No.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.160
Either we all go...

30:05.840 --> 30:07.600
or none of us go.

30:09.120 --> 30:10.320
Fine.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.440
Do you know where you're going? 
Not really, no. Do you?
Come on!

30:16.480 --> 30:18.440
Get back! This way!

30:20.640 --> 30:22.200
Right, come on.

30:26.720 --> 30:28.160
Come on.

30:28.200 --> 30:32.280
Go on without me. Come on, you old
codger. I'm not leaving you behind.

30:32.320 --> 30:34.080
Down here!

30:35.280 --> 30:36.280
Come on.

30:44.520 --> 30:46.000
Now?
No.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.800
Hold it.

30:49.400 --> 30:50.600
Now?

30:50.640 --> 30:52.960
Hold it.

30:54.560 --> 30:55.720
Now?

30:55.760 --> 30:57.360
Hold it.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.400
Now!

31:08.640 --> 31:10.240
Get off!

31:28.960 --> 31:30.400
Kate, wait.

31:30.440 --> 31:33.360
Get off! Get off me!
Wait!

31:33.400 --> 31:34.720
Come on. Wait.

31:35.760 --> 31:40.280
We must get Gisborne and Robin from
York before she returns. Let's go.

31:44.920 --> 31:49.560
So you're a noble, who's now an outlaw, with no money?

31:49.600 --> 31:50.760
Yep.

31:50.800 --> 31:52.560
Can you explain the point of that?

31:52.600 --> 31:54.160
Come on!

32:04.040 --> 32:07.280
Where did you learn that... the Orient?

32:07.320 --> 32:08.960
No.

32:09.000 --> 32:11.000
That's pure English.

32:12.520 --> 32:15.920
He doesn't, by any chance, have any money, does he?
No, I don't.

32:17.160 --> 32:20.920
I gave up all my family's wealth to help the poor.
Course you did.

32:22.040 --> 32:23.800
Pull their bodies in there.

32:23.840 --> 32:25.560
Come on.Come on. Let's keep moving.

32:29.720 --> 32:33.880
Both of you are mad. I know what poor is. I grew up that way.

32:33.920 --> 32:36.600
If either of you had...

32:36.640 --> 32:39.720
There is no honour in being poor and there's no shame in it.

32:39.760 --> 32:42.040
If you'd grown up with nothing, you'd know that.

32:42.080 --> 32:44.800
And you wouldn't apologise for
wanting to have a little money,

32:44.840 --> 32:47.120
for dreaming of something better than what you've got.

32:47.160 --> 32:50.240
You know nothing about my
life, about what I've endured!

32:50.280 --> 32:52.760
I envy you.

32:52.800 --> 32:57.560
Better no family, rich or poor,
than a leper father and a mother...

32:59.840 --> 33:01.200
My mother what?

33:06.720 --> 33:08.800
Killed in a fire.

33:12.840 --> 33:15.000
What was her name?

33:15.040 --> 33:16.480
Ghislaine.

33:20.480 --> 33:22.320
Come on. We have to keep moving.

33:27.920 --> 33:30.880
This way.It's this way.

33:30.920 --> 33:34.720
Don't argue with me. Gisborne, it's this way.

33:34.760 --> 33:36.440
Either of you been in this castle before?

33:36.480 --> 33:38.280
No. Great

33:38.320 --> 33:41.960
Come on! Find them! This way. Come on. Come on.

33:45.040 --> 33:47.800
Stop. Stop. Where's the old man?

33:47.840 --> 33:48.960
Where is he?
Don't know.

33:49.000 --> 33:51.280
You! You! Prisoner!

33:52.920 --> 33:54.960
Please!

33:55.000 --> 33:56.520
Please, don't shoot.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.680
Get off!

34:08.040 --> 34:10.840
Aaagh!

34:27.120 --> 34:28.600
Get back! Get back!

34:33.880 --> 34:36.639
It's Robin Hood! Go! Robin! Through here!

34:40.520 --> 34:42.239
Guards!

34:45.239 --> 34:48.280
Stop! Take them alive!

34:49.400 --> 34:53.520
The Sheriff of Nottingham is offering 100 crowns each

34:53.560 --> 34:56.920
for Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne.

34:56.960 --> 34:59.800
It might be worth more than that to watch them die.

34:59.840 --> 35:02.440
I think we've got a good chance.
We should give ourselves up.

35:02.480 --> 35:05.120
Give ourselves up? Yeah, live to fight another day.

35:05.160 --> 35:08.320
No. That's not how I do business.

35:08.360 --> 35:12.880
Stop! Get off me! The best chance
we have is to work together.

35:12.920 --> 35:15.080
Understood? Don't struggle.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.880
Gentlemen, I offer you Robin Hood for my freedom.

35:18.920 --> 35:21.320
He is valuable. I am not.

35:21.360 --> 35:23.440
And it'd be a shame for me to kill him,

35:23.480 --> 35:25.600
since he's worth so much more to you alive.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.120
Guards!

35:27.160 --> 35:29.040
Don't shoot!

35:29.080 --> 35:31.280
See? We're making progress.

35:34.920 --> 35:39.560
Allow me, Sheriff, to give the gift
of Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne

35:39.600 --> 35:42.120
to the Sheriff of Nottingham on your behalf.

35:42.160 --> 35:45.400
I see why the Sheriff wants you. But Gisborne?

35:45.440 --> 35:47.680
The Sheriff is his sister.

35:48.800 --> 35:49.880
His sister?

35:49.920 --> 35:51.920
The Sheriff covets them both, my lord.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.400
We're supposed to be working together.

35:54.440 --> 35:55.880
Well, I changed my mind.

35:55.920 --> 35:58.120
Do we have a deal, Sheriff?

35:58.160 --> 36:00.240
I won't kill Robin Hood and you won't kill me.

36:01.680 --> 36:03.080
Yes.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.400
It's a deal.

36:06.440 --> 36:07.880
You're gonna betray me like this?

36:07.920 --> 36:09.920
I have a sister who's the Sheriff of Nottingham.

36:09.960 --> 36:12.400
She's rich, she's powerful and she hates you.

36:12.440 --> 36:15.760
This really isn't taking me a
lot of thought.Out of the way!

36:17.480 --> 36:18.960
Nice meeting you.

36:20.440 --> 36:22.560
Seize him!
Stop!

36:24.320 --> 36:26.640
Prepare them all to die.

36:26.680 --> 36:30.160
The Sheriff of Nottingham can keep her money.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.760
I'll send her their severed heads...

36:31.800 --> 36:33.760
as a gift.

36:39.200 --> 36:41.560
I'm certainly glad I came to
rescue my brother, aren't you?

36:41.600 --> 36:43.920
This is not my fault.
No? Whose fault is it then?

36:43.960 --> 36:45.600
I didn't ask you to come.

37:09.520 --> 37:12.080
Much, John, take the right-hand side.

37:12.120 --> 37:15.000
Allan, left.

37:17.240 --> 37:19.960
The drums aren't generally thought to be a good thing.

37:34.720 --> 37:37.240
Proceed with the first execution.

37:54.240 --> 37:55.920
Get them off!

37:55.960 --> 37:57.040
This way!

38:12.080 --> 38:13.080
Let's go! Let's go!

38:21.840 --> 38:23.240
John!

38:29.280 --> 38:30.440
All right?
Yeah.

38:43.720 --> 38:46.800
Take me with you, please! Gweneth. I'm begging you!

38:46.840 --> 38:50.480
You have to stop doing this.
I want to come.
You can't.

38:50.520 --> 38:52.640
No! Leave him alone!

38:58.400 --> 39:01.880
Where is Robin Hood and Guy of Gisborne?

39:01.920 --> 39:03.520
Tell me or die.

39:03.560 --> 39:05.320
I don't know.

39:05.360 --> 39:06.880
Then you die.

39:06.920 --> 39:08.200
He's behind you.

39:08.240 --> 39:10.880
You think I'm a fool?

39:10.920 --> 39:12.920
Yes.

39:16.000 --> 39:17.440
This is my brother.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.640
And this is my family.

39:19.680 --> 39:23.000
Look, we need your help. We know
you have weapons and we need them.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.880
My weapons are for sale. Do you have money?

39:25.920 --> 39:29.000
We just risked our lives for you and you betrayed us.

39:29.040 --> 39:30.480
You owe us.

39:30.520 --> 39:33.760
Archer, I want you to join us.

39:33.800 --> 39:37.000
I want you to join us in our fight against Prince John.

39:37.040 --> 39:38.640
I'm flattered.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.720
But I have my own plans.

39:42.320 --> 39:46.920
And they don't include anyone else.
Archer, please, take me with you.

39:49.360 --> 39:50.800
Gweneth...

39:50.840 --> 39:53.360
thank you for everything you've done for me.

39:53.400 --> 39:56.120
I don't deserve a woman like you.

40:02.040 --> 40:03.520
He stole my horse.

40:07.640 --> 40:11.840
He was killed by Robin Hood's arrow.

40:11.880 --> 40:14.040
Both Hood and Gisborne escaped.

40:14.080 --> 40:18.000
I would thank you to keep a
tighter rein on your affairs...

40:18.040 --> 40:19.480
Sheriff.

40:31.360 --> 40:33.200
Gisborne killed your brother.

40:35.960 --> 40:37.400
He killed Marian.

40:37.440 --> 40:43.040
Kate, I know how much it hurts to lose someone you love.

40:43.080 --> 40:45.000
But revenge...

40:47.440 --> 40:49.200
it burns your soul.

40:49.240 --> 40:51.680
It can destroy you.

40:51.720 --> 40:54.600
But we have to look forward.

40:57.800 --> 41:00.040
I need you to accept him.

41:01.120 --> 41:05.400
We both need to accept him.

41:07.440 --> 41:09.200
I'll accept him.

41:12.360 --> 41:15.600
But I can never trust him.

41:18.480 --> 41:22.040
So, where do you want me to sleep, then?

41:33.640 --> 41:35.560
Is this the road to Nottingham?

41:54.280 --> 41:57.520
We take the castle and we hold
it till King Richard returns.

41:57.560 --> 41:59.280
If we join forces, think about it.

41:59.320 --> 42:02.440
Your power, my skill... we can be unstoppable.

42:02.480 --> 42:06.240
We can't take a castle. We can if we go down the tunnel.

42:06.280 --> 42:08.880
For a few pennies, I can trap the tunnel.

42:08.920 --> 42:10.160
No!

42:10.200 --> 42:12.880
This is how we die... buried in limestone.

42:12.920 --> 42:13.760
No!

42:13.800 --> 42:15.840
'The plan is in place.'

42:15.880 --> 42:18.400
Close the gate.

42:18.440 --> 42:20.000
Hell is coming.
