Templeton!

00:08.173 --> 00:09.164
(Turian)
Get her in the car.

00:09.242 --> 00:11.210
What's she doing
with a slug like Turian?

00:11.311 --> 00:14.838
I'd feel real bad if I had to turn
that pretty face into a road map.

00:16.883 --> 00:18.851
You kidding me, sucker?
We're there!

00:20.353 --> 00:21.684
I want that girl back.

00:21.755 --> 00:24.690
We won't shoot, sir, till we

If I see another clump of cottage

03:05.585 --> 03:06.780
I think I'm going to scream.

03:06.853 --> 03:07.877
Really?
Yes.

03:07.954 --> 03:10.184
Well, you're in luck, I made
reservations at La Rouge.

03:10.256 --> 03:12.054
Oh, thank God!
Yeah. Oh, by the way...

03:12.125 --> 03:14.719
Well, I happened to pick a little
something up for you that...

03:14.794 --> 03:15.955
You did?
Yeah.

03:16.029 --> 03:18.088
I was going to give it to you
over champagne...

03:18.164 --> 03:21.566
but I figured,
what the heck, why wait?

[exclaims]

03:24.771 --> 03:28.173
Templeton! It's beautiful!

03:29.108 --> 03:32.601
I don't know what to say.
Well, it's nothing much.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.010
Thank you.

03:37.217 --> 03:39.447
Can you put it on me, please?

03:41.788 --> 03:44.120
Well, yes.

03:47.994 --> 03:50.463
Templeton, can't you stay?

03:50.630 --> 03:52.064
Can't you tell
that blasted company...

03:52.131 --> 03:54.498
not to transfer you
to New York, please?

03:54.567 --> 03:57.332
Yes, speaking of my transfer
back to New York, I think--

03:57.403 --> 03:59.531
Let's not talk about it.
I don't want to talk about it.

03:59.606 --> 04:01.665
I don't want to think about it.
It makes me sad.

04:01.741 --> 04:03.732
Well, maybe we should.
I mean--

04:04.077 --> 04:06.876
Take a walk, pal, before you're
picking pavement out of your teeth.

04:06.946 --> 04:09.779
Picking pavement out of my teeth?
I like that. It has a certain...

04:09.849 --> 04:12.784
By the way, I don't believe
we've been properly introduced.

No! No!

04:24.163 --> 04:25.153
Get her in the car.

04:25.798 --> 04:26.788
No! No!

You mind telling me who the cowboy
playing tag in the Vette was?

05:54.454 --> 05:58.891
His name is Templeton Peck. He's
just some guy I've been dating.

05:59.625 --> 06:02.253
He's in computer sales.
Computer sales?

06:02.628 --> 06:04.460
(Turian) I'm gonna tell
you something, baby.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.056
You better hope, for your
sake, he never comes back.

06:08.568 --> 06:09.558
[screaming]

06:10.970 --> 06:13.234
You're a beautiful girl,
sweetie.

06:13.306 --> 06:17.174
And I'd feel real bad if I had to turn
that pretty face into a road map.

06:17.977 --> 06:19.604
Know what I mean?

06:28.020 --> 06:30.352
You're sure it was Johnny
Turian in the limo?

06:30.423 --> 06:33.085
I thought he was working out of Chicago.
It was Turian, Hannibal!

06:33.159 --> 06:35.355
Believe me, you don't
forget a face like that.

06:35.428 --> 06:38.090
What's she doing with a slug like Turian?
I don't know...

06:38.164 --> 06:41.429
It doesn't make sense. She's from a
small town. A real apple-pie kid.

06:41.501 --> 06:45.233
But she knows about you?
Yeah. Well, not exactly.

06:45.338 --> 06:47.636
I kind of inferred
I was in computer sales.

06:47.707 --> 06:49.573
(Hannibal) I don't like
to say this, Faceâ€œ.

06:49.642 --> 06:52.839
But maybe the lady has got
the same problem as you.

06:52.912 --> 06:54.971
Maybe you don't know
the whole story.

06:55.047 --> 06:58.142
Well, whatever her story, I like her,
Hannibal. She's something special.

06:58.217 --> 06:59.776
We've got to go in
and get her out!

06:59.852 --> 07:03.482
Don't you worry, Faceman. With B.A.'s
van here, we're gonna get her out.

07:03.556 --> 07:06.491
We gonna scour the city! We gonna
screech around every corner!

07:06.559 --> 07:09.153
We gonna tear through every
intersection till we get her out!

07:09.228 --> 07:10.491
No, Murdock!

07:10.563 --> 07:12.622
We're not going to tear
through every intersection.

07:12.698 --> 07:16.726
Now it was hard enough for me to get B.A.
to let you drive this van.

07:16.803 --> 07:19.795
I gave him my word. You're gonna
get it back in one piece!

07:19.872 --> 07:23.103
I don't suppose you've noticed that
I'm wearing gold? Do you know why?

07:23.176 --> 07:26.077
Let me tell you why. I got behind
the wheel of this van here...

07:26.145 --> 07:28.637
and I noticed that she was shimmying
a little, pulling to the left.

07:28.714 --> 07:32.810
It finally hit me. That ugly mud-sucker
tuned the suspension of this van...

07:32.885 --> 07:34.876
to compensate for all
that gold he was wearing.

07:34.954 --> 07:38.288
So, I put on a few chains,
a few rings, a bracelet...

07:38.357 --> 07:40.382
and some bricks under the seat
and it worked.

07:40.526 --> 07:42.290
Come on, Murdock.
You're not serious?

07:42.628 --> 07:44.153
Would I lie to you? Would I?

07:44.397 --> 07:46.593
(Hannibal) Face, you got the
number off that limo, right?

07:46.666 --> 07:50.034
It's leased to a company down in San Pedro.
"Revelle Fashions."

07:50.870 --> 07:55.137
Murdock, an this van
find Revelle Fashions?

07:55.308 --> 07:57.402
[imitating B.A.] You kidding me, sucker?
We're there!

07:58.578 --> 07:59.807
[tires screeching]

08:04.417 --> 08:08.411
Now, unless you've got a burning desire
to look like a piece of Swiss cheese...

08:08.488 --> 08:10.923
I suggest you stand
very still.

08:11.290 --> 08:13.918
What the hell is going on?
And who are you?

08:13.993 --> 08:16.428
We're the big, bad wolves. We've
come to blow your house down.

08:16.496 --> 08:20.831
Yeah. And when we huff and puff,
you better hold on to your socks.

08:20.900 --> 08:22.163
You all right? [whispering]
Templeton, no.

08:22.235 --> 08:23.225
Come on.

08:23.302 --> 08:26.363
What's the matter?
You don't like earrings?

08:27.006 --> 08:28.735
You chauvinist pig!

08:29.108 --> 08:32.270
Now, we hate to be gate crashers,
but we don't like it...

08:32.345 --> 08:35.280
when our friends have to be
forced to go somewhere.

08:35.347 --> 08:38.249
It throws shadows
on our sunny dispositions.

08:38.451 --> 08:39.748
[gun firing]

08:47.660 --> 08:51.722
Now, if I were you, I'd catch
the next flight to Chicago.

08:51.964 --> 08:53.159
[van engine starting]

08:55.167 --> 08:56.362
[tires screeching]

09:02.408 --> 09:05.173
You find them!
I want that girl back.

09:14.487 --> 09:16.979
I can't believe this!
Well, what do you mean?

09:17.056 --> 09:18.990
You can't just come in
like that and grab me!

09:19.058 --> 09:20.890
What are you talking about?
Stop this van right now!

09:20.960 --> 09:22.519
What? Let me out, or
I'll call the police.

09:26.098 --> 09:28.396
Police?
Look, I don't understand.

09:29.035 --> 09:30.696
Listen, Rina,
I think we should talk.

09:30.770 --> 09:32.568
Just stay out of my life!
Get the message?

09:32.638 --> 09:34.629
Look, Rina. Turian could be
right behind us.

09:34.707 --> 09:37.836
Johnny Turian is a friend of mine.
So, butt out!

09:38.010 --> 09:41.071
I don't want to see you again!
Now, wait, wait. Wait a minute.

09:41.981 --> 09:43.506
You know,
I think what we got here...

09:43.583 --> 09:45.574
is a definite lack of
communication, Hannibal.

09:54.594 --> 09:57.222
Face, correct me if I'm wrong,
but I thought you said...

09:57.296 --> 09:59.856
that you and this lady
had something special going.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.629
We have. We did.

10:03.603 --> 10:05.162
At least,
I thought we did.

10:05.338 --> 10:09.241
Hannibal, there has to be a reason
why she's acting like this.

10:09.642 --> 10:12.509
Maybe she found out that
you're not in computer sales?

10:12.578 --> 10:15.047
Look, Hannibal, I still
can't accept the fact...

10:15.114 --> 10:18.175
that she really wants to be
with Turian.

10:26.292 --> 10:28.522
I hate to say it, Faceman.
Looks like...

10:28.594 --> 10:32.292
as soon as the little lady got back to the
old hacienda she called J.T., el pronto.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.993
Hang back and follow, Murdock. I
want to see where they're going.

10:35.067 --> 10:37.161
Don't worry, Hannibal. We're
not gonna lose these suckers.

10:51.851 --> 10:55.287
Now, you wanna tell me who
those guys were back there?

10:55.955 --> 10:58.617
And don't tell me Romeo
was a computer salesman.

10:58.691 --> 11:01.991
Look, it's like I said. He's a guy I've
been dating for a couple of weeks.

11:02.061 --> 11:03.825
He obviously lied to me
about who he was.

11:03.896 --> 11:06.126
I certainly don't know
who his friends are.

11:10.069 --> 11:11.867
Did he give you this?

11:14.807 --> 11:16.070
(Rina)
Where are you taking me?

11:16.175 --> 11:18.769
(Turian) We're going down to my yacht.
I'm throwing a little party.

11:18.844 --> 11:21.142
I want you to stay there,
until this thing blows over.

11:21.213 --> 11:23.272
[water lapping]
Look, I'm not gonna run away.

11:23.349 --> 11:26.478
Didn't I just call you
when I got to my apartment?

11:27.153 --> 11:30.145
Look, it's for your own protection.
All right?

11:42.568 --> 11:45.833
Well, it's obvious now.
She was lying to me.

11:46.772 --> 11:49.969
How could she just walk
in there with him like that?

11:50.042 --> 11:52.238
Oh boy, I'm telling you.

11:52.411 --> 11:54.004
All this time
we're going together...

11:54.146 --> 11:55.636
she's pretending
to be one thing.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.446
You know, coming onto me like
she was this fashion model.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.680
All career, no personal life,
lonely, unhappy...

12:01.954 --> 12:05.049
looking for someone
to make things right.

12:05.257 --> 12:08.192
And all along she's hooked up
with a sleaze like Turian.

12:08.260 --> 12:10.695
Yeah, but you're coming on like
this great computer salesman.

12:10.763 --> 12:13.596
And all the time you're holding her
hand, you're not telling her...

12:13.666 --> 12:15.464
you're a fugitive
from the Federal Government.

12:15.534 --> 12:17.229
(Murdock)
El Jefe is right, amigo.

12:17.303 --> 12:20.170
I mean, you didn't tell the little
gal about the real, true Faceman.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.004
Come on, Hannibal, you know
we didn't do anything.

12:23.075 --> 12:25.567
We took a mission. We knocked
out an enemy position...

12:25.644 --> 12:27.806
which just happened to be
a bank.

12:27.880 --> 12:31.612
A commanding officer gets killed, and
so we end up getting sacrificed...

12:31.684 --> 12:34.517
to preserve
international relations.

12:34.587 --> 12:37.955
The four of us are on the run, Lieutenant.
All we've got is each other.

12:38.023 --> 12:42.756
Now, I don't like it, but I didn't
set it up. Neither did this girl.

12:43.095 --> 12:45.962
You don't tell her, she might
wind up paying your bill.

12:46.031 --> 12:49.126
And if you do, curtain's
down for all of us.

12:50.102 --> 12:52.764
As far as I'm concerned,
either way it's craps!

12:53.105 --> 12:55.836
You wanna play,
you gotta pay, Lieutenant.

12:55.975 --> 12:57.534
(Face) Yeah, well I hope
someone out there...

12:57.610 --> 12:58.941
thinks this is funny.

12:59.011 --> 13:02.174
The two of us looking each
other straight in the eye...

13:02.248 --> 13:04.012
and talking
about things that...

13:04.817 --> 13:06.410
neither one of us
really meant.

13:06.485 --> 13:09.750
You meant it. You just didn't wanna
hurt each other, that's all.

13:09.822 --> 13:12.621
Yeah? So why am I feeling like
I've been gut-shot?

13:12.691 --> 13:14.591
And what am I gonna do?

13:14.660 --> 13:17.027
I can't just walk away!
You're not going to.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.861
You're going to get into that party
and find out what's going on.

13:19.932 --> 13:21.957
(Murdock) And I know just
how you're gonna do it.

13:22.034 --> 13:24.765
You come up behind the boat in one
of those little rubber dinghies...

13:24.837 --> 13:26.635
the kind we've used time
and time again.

13:26.705 --> 13:30.164
Then you employ two polyurethane
Special Forces suction cups...

13:30.242 --> 13:31.607
and you climb
the side of the boat.

13:31.677 --> 13:33.270
Now, just as you're
getting to the railing...

13:33.345 --> 13:36.246
I will demonstrate
my pyrotechnic know-how.

13:36.315 --> 13:39.717
An explosion of some type,
violent in nature, no doubt.

13:39.785 --> 13:43.153
And that will be enough to divert
the attention of the guards...

13:43.222 --> 13:44.712
and allow you to get inside.

13:44.790 --> 13:47.782
The whole thing will take
20 minutes, half-hour at most.

13:47.860 --> 13:49.157
I like it, Murdock...

13:49.228 --> 13:52.823
but I think this calls for
something a little more subtle.

13:52.898 --> 13:53.922
Yeah.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.498
â™ªâ™ª[jazz music playing]

13:57.736 --> 13:58.999
[people chattering]

14:27.433 --> 14:29.026
Good afternoon.

14:34.173 --> 14:35.834
Here you go.
Thank you.

14:35.908 --> 14:38.036
I can take your invitation.
Go right on board.

14:38.110 --> 14:41.171
Thank you very much. You bet.
All right, here you go.

14:41.247 --> 14:43.409
Have a nice time.
Thank you.

14:49.455 --> 14:52.152
Look, you don't understand. I gave
my invitation to the parking valet.

14:52.224 --> 14:54.215
No. No one goes aboard unless
they have an invitation.

14:54.293 --> 14:56.625
But that's ridiculous! Of course
I got here with an invitation!

14:56.695 --> 14:59.255
I gave it to the parking valet!
Left it right down there.

14:59.331 --> 15:01.800
I'm sorry, I need an invitation,
otherwise you don't get onboard.

15:01.867 --> 15:03.858
I'm a friend of Mr. Turian's.
He invited me here!

15:03.936 --> 15:06.462
Why else would we be here? I'm
sorry, please step aside.

15:06.672 --> 15:08.231
(Burnett)
Rina, darling.

15:08.974 --> 15:11.068
[laughing]
Rina.

15:11.143 --> 15:12.804
Jason, how are you?

15:12.978 --> 15:16.744
(Burnett) Look at you. Gorgeous.
Gorgeous, gorgeous!

15:16.815 --> 15:20.046
You know, the moment I saw you in
that blue jean commercial, I died!

15:20.119 --> 15:23.680
I knew you were the one, the
only one to model my new line.

15:24.156 --> 15:25.453
(Burnett) This year's... Thanks.

15:25.524 --> 15:26.992
...Burnett Girl!

15:27.493 --> 15:28.483
Oh, Jason.

15:28.627 --> 15:30.686
Would you care for a refill?
Thank you.

15:30.763 --> 15:32.424
How do you do it?

15:32.831 --> 15:36.358
The prettiest girl, and you
grab her to model your designs.

15:36.435 --> 15:40.429
I want you to know that Jason beat
me to you, but I had my eye on you.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.705
Well, thank you, Louella.
I'm very flattered.

15:43.342 --> 15:44.673
By the way, Jason...

15:44.743 --> 15:47.508
when are we gonna get a look
at your new designs?

15:47.579 --> 15:49.775
I hear they're fabulous.

15:50.449 --> 15:53.009
And they say that you hired
an army to guard them.

15:53.085 --> 15:57.613
Well, Louella, secrecy is the key
in the fashion design business.

15:57.790 --> 16:00.020
That's how I stay on top.

16:00.559 --> 16:03.585
Come, Rina, dear.
I want you to meet someone.

16:12.604 --> 16:15.005
Don't go away,
I'll be right back.

16:41.066 --> 16:43.831
Mr. Dubrio, I'm glad you could come.
How are you?

16:43.902 --> 16:46.803
I heard you had a little
trouble today, Johnny.

16:46.939 --> 16:49.101
It was nothing.
A couple of jerks, that's all.

16:49.174 --> 16:51.836
A couple of tough guys. We took care
of them. Can I get you a drink?

16:51.910 --> 16:55.244
I got a lot riding on this, Johnny.
You told me no screw-ups.

16:55.314 --> 16:57.681
You told me you had everything
under control, right?

16:57.750 --> 16:59.650
Well, I do,
everything is fine.

16:59.718 --> 17:01.652
The girl is fantastic.
I mean, she's a real pro.

17:01.720 --> 17:03.245
She'll be in and out
with the film like that.

17:03.322 --> 17:05.188
That's the way it's gotta
go down, nice and smooth.

17:05.257 --> 17:08.021
I got a lot of money tied
up in this, and nothing--

17:08.093 --> 17:10.186
Look--
Nothing can go wrong.

17:10.262 --> 17:12.731
You understand that, Johnny?
You know me, Mr. Dubrio.

17:12.798 --> 17:15.790
I mean, I'll do anything
to get a job done. Anything.

17:15.867 --> 17:19.634
Well, that's why I work with you, kid.
Don't disappoint me. Okay?

17:26.512 --> 17:28.776
Well, well, well, well, well.

17:29.281 --> 17:30.749
What are you doing here?

17:30.816 --> 17:33.547
Well, I was going to ask you
the same question.

17:33.619 --> 17:36.589
Well, you've gotta leave, because if
they find you here, they'll kill you.

17:36.655 --> 17:39.147
So now you are concerned
about me?

17:39.992 --> 17:42.393
You lied to me. You're not
who you said you are.

17:42.461 --> 17:46.193
And you lied to me. Look, do you think
we can get out of the corridor?

17:53.639 --> 17:54.629
[sighing]

17:54.840 --> 17:58.208
Templeton, I'm so scared!
I missed you so much.

17:59.411 --> 18:02.381
Wait. Wait a minute.
I'm a little confused here.

18:02.448 --> 18:05.941
I mean, I'm remembering a drive
up the coast to Santa Barbara.

18:06.018 --> 18:08.544
I'm remembering dinner
at a little country inn.

18:08.620 --> 18:11.817
I'm remembering a night,
many nights of...

18:12.391 --> 18:14.621
Then all of a sudden, I have
the gate slammed in my face.

18:14.693 --> 18:19.324
I come down here to find out why,
and now you melt in my arms.

18:19.932 --> 18:23.891
I'm not saying I don't enjoy a
challenge, but this is ridiculous.

18:25.437 --> 18:27.701
You've got to believe me.
I was afraid you'd get hurt.

18:27.773 --> 18:29.867
You have no idea what Johnny
Turian is capable of.

18:29.942 --> 18:34.004
Look, Rina, I know you're in trouble, all
right? I wanna help. So just tell me.

18:34.079 --> 18:36.343
Don't you think there's a few
things you should tell me?

18:36.415 --> 18:37.712
(Rina)
Like who you really are?

18:37.783 --> 18:41.515
Well, there's a part of my life I
didn't want you to know about.

18:44.590 --> 18:47.321
It looks like we had more
in common than we thought.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.827
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

18:53.932 --> 18:56.060
I was married
to Johnny Turian's brother.

18:56.135 --> 18:57.830
I was young and naive enough
to think...

18:57.903 --> 19:00.031
that Tony was different from
his brother, but I was wrong.

19:00.105 --> 19:01.766
Less than a year later,
he was arrested...

19:01.840 --> 19:03.774
for putting a bullet
through someone's head.

19:03.842 --> 19:05.776
So, I changed my name.
I moved out here.

19:05.844 --> 19:07.972
And I wanted to put that
chapter of my life behind me.

19:08.046 --> 19:11.846
Then, you're telling me Turian wants
to reopen it, but not by your choice.

19:14.753 --> 19:15.914
Yes or no?

19:17.723 --> 19:18.849
No.

19:18.924 --> 19:21.689
Turian is planning on ripping off
Jason Burnett's line of clothes.

19:21.760 --> 19:24.752
He can clean up if he can get counterfeit
copies into the marketplace...

19:24.830 --> 19:26.320
before
Jason's originals arrive.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.760
Yeah, Burnett's security
is impossible to penetrate...

19:28.834 --> 19:32.065
so Turian needs someone to get a look
at the fashions before they go public.

19:32.471 --> 19:34.371
He needs a model,
he needs you.

19:34.606 --> 19:38.099
Burnett uses dummy addresses.
He arranges for phony showings.

19:38.177 --> 19:40.544
He's constantly changing
the location of his fittings.

19:40.612 --> 19:41.977
In fact,
the location is so secret...

19:42.047 --> 19:44.311
that he's sending a limousine
to take me there.

19:44.383 --> 19:47.876
Turian wants me to photograph the
styles in tomorrow's fitting.

19:47.953 --> 19:49.318
Well, you're not gonna
go through with it.

19:49.388 --> 19:51.083
I'm gonna get you outta here.
No! I can't!

19:51.156 --> 19:54.854
I know that sounds crazy, but I can't go
with you! You've just got to believe me.

19:55.027 --> 19:57.826
[sighing] Now you've got to go
before someone finds you here!

19:57.896 --> 20:00.831
Rina, what is Turian holding
over you? What...

20:00.999 --> 20:02.592
What are you
holding back?

20:02.668 --> 20:04.534
If I tell you, you'll try
to do something about it.

20:04.603 --> 20:06.867
And I don't want you to!
I don't want you to help me!

20:06.939 --> 20:09.067
Now, time is running out.
Please, you've got to go!

20:10.309 --> 20:11.538
Turian took it.

20:11.810 --> 20:13.039
Goodbye.

20:13.545 --> 20:15.240
Where is she?
I don't see her here.

20:16.048 --> 20:19.143
Well, she's around,
she's around.

20:19.585 --> 20:21.246
I told her to mingle
with the crowd.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.512
What do you think?
She jumped overboard?

20:24.590 --> 20:26.490
I don't wanna take
any chances, Johnny.

20:26.558 --> 20:28.788
You keep your eye on her!
You understand?

20:29.861 --> 20:31.192
Yeah. Okay.

20:32.264 --> 20:33.459
I'll go look for her.

20:41.673 --> 20:43.004
I'll be in touch.

20:46.812 --> 20:47.802
[door closing]

20:55.988 --> 20:56.978
[sighing]

21:16.575 --> 21:18.236
Hey, what's the matter?

21:19.778 --> 21:21.542
You don't like to mingle?

21:22.681 --> 21:25.048
I want you back up
at the party. Now, all right?

21:51.843 --> 21:53.937
Hey! Hey,
what are you doing down there?

21:55.280 --> 21:58.443
Wouldn't you know it! Lisa, the
blonde with the slinky black dress...

21:58.517 --> 22:00.451
she gave me
the wrong cabin number.

22:01.019 --> 22:02.646
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

22:20.772 --> 22:23.207
Looks like we found ourselves
a sneak thief.

22:23.775 --> 22:24.799
[exclaiming]

22:24.876 --> 22:27.402
Wait a minute, fellas.
Now, can't we talk this over?

22:27.779 --> 22:29.770
My tailor hates knife holes.

22:29.881 --> 22:31.440
Excuse me, hot stuff.

22:31.516 --> 22:33.075
Hey, pal, can I get through?

22:34.553 --> 22:35.714
[groaning]

22:44.763 --> 22:46.288
I thought you might need
some help.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.732
You got that right.
Well, let's go!

22:49.634 --> 22:52.035
(Dennison) We found someone
ripping off your jewelry.

23:12.290 --> 23:13.519
[motor boat engine rumbling]

23:25.303 --> 23:27.499
My security is falling apart!

23:27.939 --> 23:29.907
What am I paying you guys for?

23:30.475 --> 23:33.570
I got guys coming at me with
machine guns in my warehouse!

23:33.678 --> 23:37.478
And you let a couple of two-bit
jewel thieves waltz in here...

23:37.549 --> 23:39.142
and rip off my cufflinks!

23:39.217 --> 23:40.275
I swear to you,
Mr. Turian.

23:40.352 --> 23:43.947
I don't know how they could have
got aboard. We doubled security.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.429
So, our friend
Johnny's come up in the world.

23:54.499 --> 23:57.560
No more running off cheap T-shirts
and counterfeit hotpants.

23:58.069 --> 23:59.161
Wait a minute!

23:59.237 --> 24:00.227
[shushing]

24:00.338 --> 24:01.464
You hear that?
What?

24:01.540 --> 24:02.837
"Clippety-clop.
Clippety-clop."

24:02.908 --> 24:04.467
It's like the engine
is off a tinge!

24:04.543 --> 24:06.238
I mean, I just had this baby
tuned up!

24:06.311 --> 24:09.770
Relax, Murdock! It sounds fine.
B.A.'s put his trust in me.

24:09.848 --> 24:12.408
He knows I'm taking care of his van
and I'm not taking any chances.

24:12.484 --> 24:15.215
This baby's going to be in tip-top
shape when he gets back here.

24:15.287 --> 24:17.381
Maybe I should take her
in for another tune-up.

24:17.489 --> 24:20.083
I don't think it's the van that
needs the tune-up, Murdock.

24:20.692 --> 24:23.320
Could you turn down the heat? My
shoe leather's starting to crack.

24:23.462 --> 24:25.396
No. I want it to be warm
in here.

24:25.464 --> 24:26.659
It keeps the carpet fluffy!

24:26.731 --> 24:30.031
B.A.'s going to be real proud of me when
he gets back here to pick up his ride.

24:30.101 --> 24:31.364
Look, Hannibal
I'm telling you.

24:31.436 --> 24:35.373
Whatever Turian's using to blackmail Rina
into taking those photographs is working.

24:35.707 --> 24:37.175
The girl's terrified.

24:37.242 --> 24:40.610
Well, the only way we can solve her problem
is to take Turian out of the picture.

24:40.679 --> 24:42.443
You got a plan, Colonel?
Yeah.

24:42.514 --> 24:46.508
Turian expects a roll of film with
Burnett's fashions on them, right?

24:46.685 --> 24:50.019
So, we'll give him a roll of
film with some hot styles on it.

24:50.121 --> 24:51.953
That's great,
but how you going to do it?

24:52.023 --> 24:54.014
Simple.
We'll design our own fashions.

24:55.527 --> 24:59.395
And you, Murdock,
will be our designer.

24:59.898 --> 25:02.458
Murdock?
A fashion designer!

25:02.567 --> 25:04.558
[speaking with European
accent] Something with flair.

25:05.103 --> 25:08.596
<i>Elegance. Haute coiffure.</i>

25:08.940 --> 25:12.376
Yes. Something like that.
Okay, zip it.

25:12.444 --> 25:15.880
So, we get the designs. How are
we going to get them made?

26:01.526 --> 26:04.791
[speaking with accent] Okay!
We are doing fine, ladies.

26:05.063 --> 26:07.896
Keep up the pace, Irma,
we need these dresses.

26:07.966 --> 26:09.832
This is so exciting.

26:09.901 --> 26:14.702
And remember, you keep the machines.
We keep the designs.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.739
Perfect. Nice.

26:26.918 --> 26:28.818
Now all we need
are some models.

26:29.621 --> 26:30.986
Ladies.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.951
Well, Face, I'm Impressed.

26:36.061 --> 26:39.929
Yeah, well, you should be.
May I have your coats, please.

26:40.298 --> 26:42.699
And where did you find
these beautiful ladies?

26:43.001 --> 26:45.197
At the Leopard Club.

26:45.503 --> 26:47.369
(Face)
Shall we, ladies? Over here.

26:48.740 --> 26:52.574
Excuse me, you dropped this.

26:52.944 --> 26:55.936
Perhaps. You would allow
me to put it back on?

26:56.381 --> 26:58.907
Later, Captain.
This way, ma'am.

27:02.887 --> 27:04.082
Beautiful.

27:07.726 --> 27:10.491
I love it! Oh, yes! Yes!

27:24.743 --> 27:26.541
I think I missed my calling.

27:27.345 --> 27:29.746
Nice job, Captain.

27:46.131 --> 27:48.930
Are you ready yet? Burnett's here.
I'll be ready in a minute.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.695
You're ready now.

27:50.769 --> 27:53.864
And don't be getting any dumb ideas, just
because you'll be out of my sight...

27:53.938 --> 27:55.201
for a couple of hours.

27:55.273 --> 27:57.264
Don't forget
my insurance policy.

28:14.826 --> 28:16.885
Rina, darling.
Hi, Jason.

28:27.939 --> 28:29.464
We're all set here, Murdock.

28:36.314 --> 28:38.078
This is Mr. Burnett's driver,
Execu-Tech...

28:38.149 --> 28:41.380
<i>Security Code Number 1-4,
heading to North Kendall Drive.</i>

28:41.486 --> 28:44.148
(operator) Yes, sir. We'll
check at your destination.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.139
(Face)
Getting a signal?

29:10.648 --> 29:13.549
Loud and clear, Captain.
Let's go!

29:37.976 --> 29:39.068
[ringing]

29:40.678 --> 29:41.736
(Burnett)
Yes?

29:41.813 --> 29:44.783
Mr. Burnett,
this is Execu-Tech Security.

29:44.849 --> 29:46.442
I'm picking up
an electronic signal...

29:46.518 --> 29:49.112
coming from the right rear
bumper panel on your limousine.

29:51.189 --> 29:53.123
(Burnett)
Check the rear bumper.

30:12.477 --> 30:16.175
When will my competitors ever
learn I can't be followed?

30:19.984 --> 30:21.816
Well.
What's wrong?

30:22.320 --> 30:25.221
The signal stopped. Their security
people must've found the bug.

30:25.290 --> 30:26.519
They're better than I thought.

30:26.591 --> 30:30.619
Well, that's it. By the time we find them,
they could've handed the film over.

30:30.829 --> 30:34.288
Oh, no. Now we go
to our contingency plan.

30:41.239 --> 30:43.833
Hey, what's going on?
We got a three-alarmer!

30:44.075 --> 30:45.065
[siren blaring]

30:45.176 --> 30:47.577
Everybody get out the fire exit!
Now, try not to panic.

30:47.645 --> 30:49.204
We'll try
and save everybody's lives.

30:49.280 --> 30:51.112
There's oxygen downstairs
for anybody who needs it.

30:51.182 --> 30:53.207
But we can't leave
the control room un-manned!

30:53.284 --> 30:54.376
[explosions sounding]

30:54.452 --> 30:57.319
It sounds like they hit the gas pipe.
You better hurry!

31:02.227 --> 31:03.319
<i>[siren blaring]</i>

31:06.731 --> 31:08.290
All right. Burnett.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.166
Is that one "T" or two?
Two.

31:15.240 --> 31:16.230
Yeah.

31:19.444 --> 31:21.538
(Murdock) Nothing. There's no
access under Burnett's name.

31:22.113 --> 31:24.104
Try the limo license plate.

31:24.349 --> 31:27.979
1-W-K-B-4-2-0.

31:32.390 --> 31:33.380
That's it.

31:33.758 --> 31:36.250
And they're heading for
468 North Kendall Drive.

31:38.029 --> 31:39.224
[birds chirping]

32:04.956 --> 32:08.017
(limo driver) Security Code 14.
Returning to rendezvous point.

32:14.332 --> 32:15.891
Why are we stopping?

32:17.535 --> 32:18.969
How you doing?

32:20.071 --> 32:22.438
I don't believe it.
How did you get in here?

32:22.640 --> 32:24.734
Hey, would I abandon a lady
in distress?

32:24.876 --> 32:27.106
Now, look we don't have much time.
Did you take the pictures?

32:27.178 --> 32:29.203
Yeah.

32:31.449 --> 32:33.042
What do you want to do?

32:33.151 --> 32:36.052
Make sure that Turian doesn't make
copies of Burnett's originals.

32:36.921 --> 32:39.822
Now, I want you to give Turian this
roll of film, all right? It has...

32:39.924 --> 32:40.982
[chuckles]

32:41.059 --> 32:42.720
...another set
of designs on it.

32:42.794 --> 32:44.489
I can't. I can't. I'm sorry.

32:44.562 --> 32:47.361
You don't know what's at stake.
I can't. Rina, look.

32:48.299 --> 32:51.860
By the time Turian finds out we switched
film, we'll have you out of this.

32:52.136 --> 32:54.332
Now, come on,
you got to trust me on this.

32:56.274 --> 32:57.935
Okay.

33:06.084 --> 33:07.813
Don't worry.
I won't let you down.

33:36.180 --> 33:37.511
Now give me the film.

33:38.816 --> 33:40.341
Where's the film?

33:41.986 --> 33:45.547
He has it in his pocket.

33:56.567 --> 33:58.228
Why? Why'd you do this?

34:12.516 --> 34:13.882
Mommy! Mommy!

34:13.951 --> 34:14.940
[Rina exclaiming]

34:15.053 --> 34:18.455
Baby!
Mommy, I'm so scared!

34:18.556 --> 34:22.254
Mommy's here, baby.
Are you all right?

34:22.726 --> 34:24.786
I'm all right, Mommy.
They didn't hurt me.

34:25.463 --> 34:26.987
Thank God.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.626
I'm sorry, Templeton,
I really am.

34:30.701 --> 34:33.261
I couldn't tell you Turian had Eric.
I was terrified.

34:33.838 --> 34:35.272
I understand.

34:35.505 --> 34:36.996
Let me look at you.

35:07.805 --> 35:10.137
So you figured
on pulling a switch, huh?

35:11.342 --> 35:13.674
Sticking me with a roll
of phony styles.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.308
[birds chirping]

35:21.786 --> 35:23.811
Counterfeiting dresses?

35:23.888 --> 35:26.983
I figured you more for the
"ripping off of cars" kind of guy.

35:27.058 --> 35:29.390
You know, a little loan sharking
thrown in on the side, maybe.

35:29.460 --> 35:31.394
We got a real wise guy here,
don't we?

35:31.462 --> 35:33.590
Johnny, don't hurt him!
Hurt him?

35:34.265 --> 35:37.667
I'm not going to hurt him, baby.
I'm going to let the sharks do it.

35:38.503 --> 35:41.871
When we get far enough out,
unload these three.

35:48.112 --> 35:49.739
You all right?
Templeton, I'm scared.

35:50.648 --> 35:53.242
It's going to be all right.
Come on, gimme a little smile.

35:55.820 --> 35:57.151
That's better.
Look, all we got to do...

35:57.221 --> 35:59.986
is wait for my friend Hannibal
to come up with a plan.

36:00.525 --> 36:01.515
[sighing]

36:01.626 --> 36:02.684
I just hope it's a good one.

36:11.135 --> 36:12.864
I can't believe
she turned him in.

36:13.104 --> 36:15.334
You better come up with a
plan lickety-split, Colonel.

36:15.473 --> 36:18.272
Otherwise, our Faceman's going to be
doing flip-ups with Charlie Tuna.

36:18.342 --> 36:22.176
Turian notified the harbor master
he's going to put out to sea at 4:00.

36:22.547 --> 36:25.812
Now, that's not much time.
But, with my plan...

36:26.651 --> 36:29.279
it's just enough
for you and me, Murdock.

36:56.814 --> 36:58.714
(Hannibal) Well, what
do you think, Captain?

36:58.783 --> 37:01.275
She looks like she belongs
in a movie, Colonel.

37:03.054 --> 37:04.044
Yeah.

39:00.471 --> 39:02.963
What did I tell you, Mr. Dubrio?
Your boy came through.

39:03.474 --> 39:04.942
I sent the film on its way.

39:05.142 --> 39:07.372
That's good, Johnny.

39:07.878 --> 39:11.280
Yeah, you did very good. That
makes me very happy. Yeah.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.512
I'm going to call the people overseas.
Tell them designs are on their way.

39:14.585 --> 39:18.351
By the end of the week, we'll have a
hundred thousand copies ready to ship.

39:19.156 --> 39:22.319
Yeah. Good. Yeah, you take care.
I'll be In touch.

40:27.091 --> 40:30.527
Murdock, take her two points to port.
I want to cross his bow.

40:30.594 --> 40:33.359
[in English accent]
Oh, look alive, ye lubbers!

40:33.431 --> 40:36.628
Open the gun ports and
gunners, man your stations!

40:36.867 --> 40:39.632
Load the 16-pounders
with gunshot!

40:39.703 --> 40:42.900
Lower the mainsail
and shorten the jib!

40:42.973 --> 40:45.408
And a quarter turn
south southwest!

40:45.476 --> 40:48.605
We won't shoot, sir, till we
see the whites of their eyes!

40:48.846 --> 40:52.874
And if they've got their backs to us...
Well, you get my drift, sir.

40:57.588 --> 41:01.354
<i>This is Captain Detweiler of
the Los Angeles Harbor Patrol.</i>

41:01.592 --> 41:05.085
<i>We'd like permission to come aboard
and examine your ship's documents.</i>

41:05.162 --> 41:06.288
What do we do?

41:06.363 --> 41:08.331
What do you want me to do,
tell them no?

41:08.899 --> 41:10.196
All right, come aboard.

41:42.299 --> 41:44.996
Take them up to the bridge.
That won't be necessary.

41:45.569 --> 41:48.800
Just take us to Rina
and to our friend.

41:57.781 --> 42:00.113
Hannibal, you constantly
amaze me.

42:00.351 --> 42:02.547
Let's get out of here.
You got pigs right now!

42:20.638 --> 42:21.628
[groaning]

42:24.542 --> 42:26.533
That's round one and you lost.

42:27.711 --> 42:28.701
[panting]

42:31.448 --> 42:34.440
If you're looking for the film with
Burnett's designs on it, it's too late.

42:34.518 --> 42:36.509
I've already
sent it out of the country.

42:36.587 --> 42:40.148
As far as the fake one,
I threw it overboard.

42:41.158 --> 42:42.387
I don't think so.

42:42.459 --> 42:44.723
You see, I figured
you had Rina so frightened...

42:44.795 --> 42:47.958
that she'd probably tell you
I switched film. So...

42:48.933 --> 42:50.264
I didn't switch films.

42:50.401 --> 42:52.199
(Face) Do you understand
what I'm saying here?

42:52.269 --> 42:55.136
Ou threw the real roll overboard,
not the fake one.

42:55.205 --> 42:58.835
That's life, Johnny boy, and when your Mr.
Dubrio discovers...

42:58.909 --> 43:01.606
that his mills are stamping
out $10 million worth...

43:01.712 --> 43:03.271
of phony designs, well...

43:03.480 --> 43:05.972
I don't think he's going to be
very happy, now, do you?

43:06.083 --> 43:08.552
[imitating Cary Grant] Faceman,
I wouldn't call them phony.

43:08.752 --> 43:10.015
(Murdock)
Highly imaginative...

43:10.087 --> 43:12.283
the work of a genius,
but not phony.

43:12.356 --> 43:14.450
I'm thinking about coming out
with a whole new line.

43:15.392 --> 43:16.791
Oh, yeah, I almost forgot.

43:24.401 --> 43:25.391
[sighing]

43:27.738 --> 43:31.038
Let's go, Murdock.
Come on, Face. Get them out.

43:35.679 --> 43:38.614
And, I'm sorry about that hole
in your boat.

43:40.150 --> 43:41.140
What hole?

43:41.485 --> 43:44.750
The hole that,
this is going to make.

43:49.426 --> 43:50.416
Abandon ship.

44:25.129 --> 44:27.223
I love it
when a plan comes together.

44:35.172 --> 44:37.971
"Johnny Turian Disappears."
I like the ring of that.

44:39.343 --> 44:42.313
I am so grateful to you. You got
Johnny Turian out of my life.

44:42.379 --> 44:45.007
You saved my little boy. I'll
never forget It. Thank you.

44:46.483 --> 44:49.817
Why do I get the feeling
that sounded like a goodbye?

44:50.254 --> 44:53.121
You know, B.A.'s train should
have been in an hour ago.

44:53.424 --> 44:56.121
He and Murdock ought to be here any minute.
I'll check on them.

44:56.226 --> 44:57.387
All right.

44:59.663 --> 45:00.994
You know, Rina, I...

45:01.165 --> 45:03.293
I never meant to lead you on.

45:04.668 --> 45:06.602
The truth this time?
Well, I...

45:06.737 --> 45:09.934
I meant to lead you on,
I just never meant...

45:11.575 --> 45:14.636
I never had any idea
where it was going to go.

45:18.282 --> 45:20.512
Look, I was having such a good
time today...

45:20.584 --> 45:22.416
I never
thought about tomorrow.

45:22.486 --> 45:24.511
But we have to think
about tomorrow, don't we?

45:25.355 --> 45:26.516
Listen to me.

45:26.724 --> 45:28.249
How long
do you think it would be...

45:28.325 --> 45:29.815
before the military caught up
with you...

45:29.893 --> 45:31.657
if you had
a permanent address?

45:31.995 --> 45:34.623
I guess I'd better...

45:36.567 --> 45:37.762
I guess.

46:03.360 --> 46:06.193
(Murdock) Yeah, B.A., me
and the old van, here...

46:06.263 --> 46:08.630
we've established
a kind of bond.

46:09.366 --> 46:12.427
It was a little rough going at first.
I had to get used to it.

46:12.503 --> 46:15.302
It had to get used to me.
But now we mesh!

46:15.506 --> 46:18.476
Just like a well-oiled machine
Now, sit back. Relax.

46:18.542 --> 46:21.239
You've been on a long trip,
I can tell by your eyes.

46:21.445 --> 46:22.606
It just don't seem right.

46:23.080 --> 46:25.606
You sitting behind the wheel
and me sitting over here.

46:27.284 --> 46:29.218
Hey, B.A.? Look at that!

46:30.087 --> 46:31.486
Murdock, look out!

46:32.156 --> 46:33.351
(Murdock)
Oh, no!

46:33.924 --> 46:35.221
[B.A. screaming]
Murdock!
