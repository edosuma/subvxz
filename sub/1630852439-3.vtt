00:17.600 --> 00:20.019
Whatever comes, face it on your feet!

00:21.105 --> 00:23.315
Closer.

00:23.399 --> 00:26.484
Burn me!
Dig your blasted heels in, Warder!

00:29.405 --> 00:30.739
Look alive!

00:37.579 --> 00:38.831
Blood and ashes.

00:45.920 --> 00:47.131
On your feet.

01:01.395 --> 01:02.896
Jearom Gaidin.

01:04.522 --> 01:08.234
Sir, yes, the greatest swordsman.

01:11.530 --> 01:13.031
A man without history.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.704
Only legends pass through
the ranks of the warders.

01:29.590 --> 01:31.759
His prowess with a sword knew no equal.

01:48.984 --> 01:53.989
In battle, all who should cross him found
themselves at the far end of his blade.

01:57.742 --> 01:58.661
Save one.

02:05.459 --> 02:09.087
Ten thousand victories
and a single loss...

02:10.673 --> 02:13.842
to a farmer with a wooden quarterstaff.

02:15.885 --> 02:18.430
His sole defeat became a legacy.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.020
Never again underestimate your fellow man.

02:26.396 --> 02:29.441
Respect the wielder, not the weapon.

02:31.901 --> 02:34.572
Who is the greatest blademaster
of all time?
