03:21.953 --> 03:22.745
He's cute.

03:23.621 --> 03:25.289
- He's got nice legs for a geek.

03:59.657 --> 04:00.866
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

04:00.867 --> 04:01.867
- Hi, Stretch!

04:01.868 --> 04:05.580
Are you getting taller
or did I break a heel?

04:06.873 --> 04:08.373
- Facutly pension checks

04:11.794 --> 04:13.922
Here comes young Skridlow.

04:17.300 --> 04:18.591
- Good afternoon, Skridlow.

04:18.593 --> 04:19.719
Right on time.

04:20.720 --> 04:23.263
- Finished classes, six miles
into town to the faculty club

04:23.264 --> 04:25.557
as usual, and now I'm indulging myself.

04:25.558 --> 04:27.267
Dinner out and a movie.

04:27.268 --> 04:28.144
- Ah.
- Bye.

04:34.651 --> 04:36.735
- Look, I paid 50 dollars for this tie

04:36.736 --> 04:38.570
and I think it looks great, okay?

04:38.571 --> 04:39.404
- [Diavolo] Yeah, well, I woulda

04:39.405 --> 04:40.280
bought the other one, you know?

04:40.281 --> 04:42.241
- I didn't hire you to
be a fashion consultant,

04:42.242 --> 04:43.492
I hired you to drive.

04:43.493 --> 04:46.203
So please, just drive, hmm?

04:46.204 --> 04:48.747
- (faking accent) Well, one day
I'm gonna have my own driver

04:48.748 --> 04:51.375
because I am gonna be an actor.

04:51.376 --> 04:52.417
- Look, Diavolo, just cut the

04:52.418 --> 04:55.045
Sidney Poitier impressions, okay?

04:55.046 --> 04:57.881
- They'll call me Mr. Diavolo.

04:57.882 --> 04:58.757
- Fine.

04:58.758 --> 05:01.260
(tires squealing)

05:01.261 --> 05:02.094
- Hey, wait a second, man,

05:02.095 --> 05:04.388
what the fuck's going on here?

05:04.389 --> 05:05.222
- Who is it?

05:05.223 --> 05:06.056
- Says moms.

05:06.057 --> 05:08.101
That's one of Mom's cars!

05:11.271 --> 05:15.941
Hey, man, where the fuck you
get your driver's license, man?

05:15.942 --> 05:18.527
(horn honking)

05:18.528 --> 05:19.987
- Hey, Smooth!

05:19.988 --> 05:22.114
- Yeah, here's the Yul Brynner clones.

05:22.115 --> 05:24.449
- Hey, Smooth Walker!

05:24.450 --> 05:25.534
- Me?

05:25.535 --> 05:27.995
- Yeah, you, you son of a bitch!

05:27.996 --> 05:30.414
Mom wants to see ya!

05:30.415 --> 05:31.290
- Silly me, I...

05:31.291 --> 05:33.959
I thought we were in the
middle of a motorcade here.

05:33.960 --> 05:36.461
Aren't you boys on your way
to the cue ball convention?

05:36.462 --> 05:38.171
- Yeah, you...

05:38.172 --> 05:39.006
(car bumping)

05:39.007 --> 05:39.965
- Hey, man, watch it, asshole!

05:39.966 --> 05:41.717
- Just be cool and drive, okay, Diavolo?

05:41.718 --> 05:43.468
- Say, Jack, you know I
just had this motherfucker

05:43.469 --> 05:44.594
washed and waxed?

05:44.595 --> 05:45.929
- Diavolo, just be cool, be cool.

05:45.930 --> 05:50.727
- [Diavolo] Say, boss, you
want me to lose these assholes?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.273
(tires screeching)

06:06.617 --> 06:08.327
- Come on, get out!

06:08.328 --> 06:09.161
Let's go!

06:09.162 --> 06:09.995
- Take it easy.

06:09.996 --> 06:10.829
- Mom's waiting!

06:10.830 --> 06:11.663
- Take it easy on the suit.

06:11.664 --> 06:13.123
Look, you want the
Asshole of the Year award?

06:13.124 --> 06:14.249
You have my vote, okay?

06:14.250 --> 06:15.960
Take it easy, Johnny.

06:18.254 --> 06:19.463
Okay, okay, guys.

06:19.464 --> 06:22.342
Listen, I can walk by myself, okay?

06:23.468 --> 06:26.346
What are you guys, training wheels?

06:27.597 --> 06:32.142
Hi, Mom, it's a pleasure
to see you as always.

06:32.143 --> 06:34.437
- You owe me 80,000 dollars.

06:35.396 --> 06:36.356
- Uh-uh, 60.

06:37.273 --> 06:39.232
I'm a couple of months behind.

06:39.233 --> 06:40.817
- 80.

06:40.818 --> 06:44.279
The 20,000 extra is a
late payment penalty.

06:44.280 --> 06:46.114
There are lots of other
penalties, you know.

06:46.115 --> 06:48.450
- (scoffs) Look, Mom, I'm doing my best.

06:48.451 --> 06:49.493
I mean, I got over--

06:49.494 --> 06:51.078
- Shut up.

06:51.079 --> 06:53.663
The only reason you're
walking around with both knees

06:53.664 --> 06:55.791
is 'cause you got a class act. (snorts)

06:55.792 --> 06:57.709
I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

06:57.710 --> 07:00.588
You give me your money, your girls,

07:01.631 --> 07:03.590
everything else you got.

07:03.591 --> 07:05.258
Call it even.

07:05.259 --> 07:06.927
- What about me?

07:06.928 --> 07:08.178
- I'll let you live.

07:08.179 --> 07:08.970
(high pitched giggling)

07:08.971 --> 07:09.764
Quiet!

07:10.932 --> 07:12.057
- Mom...

07:12.058 --> 07:13.683
I mean, you know how
things work in this town.

07:13.684 --> 07:15.519
Now, if it was up to me alone,

07:15.520 --> 07:17.896
I'd be thrilled to settle
this thing with you,

07:17.897 --> 07:19.272
but well...

07:19.273 --> 07:20.900
I got a new partner.

07:24.112 --> 07:25.695
- Another partner?

07:25.696 --> 07:28.574
- This guy, this dude from Detroit.

07:29.700 --> 07:31.701
Uh, he just moved in on me.

07:31.702 --> 07:32.536
- Detroit?

07:32.537 --> 07:33.453
Oh, are you kidding?

07:33.454 --> 07:35.163
I know people in Detroit.

07:35.164 --> 07:36.331
- Not this guy.

07:36.332 --> 07:38.583
I mean, he's too big, he's too bad.

07:38.584 --> 07:40.168
He's as bad as you are,

07:40.169 --> 07:41.629
maybe even badder.

07:43.005 --> 07:44.464
I'm scared, Mom.

07:44.465 --> 07:45.841
And that's why I...

07:45.842 --> 07:48.052
I go along with the Doctor.

07:49.303 --> 07:50.512
- The Doctor?

07:50.513 --> 07:51.471
- Yeah.

07:51.472 --> 07:52.347
Doctor.

07:52.348 --> 07:53.558
Doctor Detroit.

07:56.853 --> 07:58.478
I don't know if he's really from Detroit,

07:58.479 --> 08:01.356
maybe that's just a handle he uses.

08:01.357 --> 08:03.984
- You mean you let this
jerk-off muscle in on Mom?

08:03.985 --> 08:05.152
Just let him without...

08:05.153 --> 08:06.528
Just let him in?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.321
- I was scared, Mom.

08:08.322 --> 08:09.699
He's a scary guy.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.285
- I gotta meet this Doctor.

08:13.286 --> 08:14.119
I'll...

08:14.120 --> 08:16.204
I'll see if I can arrange a meeting.

08:16.205 --> 08:18.957
But do me a favor, Mom,
just leave me out of it.

08:18.958 --> 08:20.917
I have suffered enough.

08:20.918 --> 08:22.794
- Okay, boys, turn him loose.

08:22.795 --> 08:26.006
If he gets outta line, you
can have him for lunch.

08:26.007 --> 08:27.632
- What?

08:27.633 --> 08:29.677
What is it with you guys?

08:34.640 --> 08:35.682
Diavolo.

08:35.683 --> 08:36.640
- Where to, boss?

08:36.642 --> 08:39.059
- Australia, South Pole...

08:39.061 --> 08:39.895
China, okay?

08:39.895 --> 08:41.438
- Well, I gotta stop and
get gas, you know that.

08:41.438 --> 08:43.523
- (sighs) Just drive, okay?

08:43.524 --> 08:44.317
Please?

08:47.487 --> 08:50.114
(motor revving)

08:52.116 --> 08:54.494
(screeching)

09:03.044 --> 09:04.377
- Hey, man, I hate to say this again,

09:04.378 --> 09:07.547
but you got your little
fuzzy white ass in a crack.

09:07.548 --> 09:09.549
And you know there isn't
any Doctor Detroit.

09:09.550 --> 09:11.092
You just pissed away the money!

09:11.093 --> 09:13.178
- Please, I know what I did.

09:13.179 --> 09:15.639
I am trying to figure a way out.

09:15.640 --> 09:16.473
- Yeah, okay.

09:16.474 --> 09:17.766
Okay, well, you just remember that you

09:17.767 --> 09:20.185
didn't spend any of that money on me.

09:20.186 --> 09:22.187
- It doesn't matter, bro.

09:22.188 --> 09:25.190
You are in this with me,
I am not going down alone.

09:25.191 --> 09:26.525
- Wait a second, man, what
are you talking about, man?

09:26.526 --> 09:28.610
It's not my fault that
you spent all that money

09:28.611 --> 09:30.570
on those clothes, those shoes,

09:30.571 --> 09:32.572
this big gas guzzling tank

09:32.573 --> 09:33.949
and that penthouse of yours!

09:33.950 --> 09:35.825
- Diavolo, I didn't say it was your fault,

09:35.826 --> 09:37.494
I said it was your problem.

09:37.495 --> 09:41.122
Now we have to find
ourselves a patsy, okay?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.500
- Now, what kinda patsy you talking about?

09:43.501 --> 09:45.293
- I don't know.

09:45.294 --> 09:49.214
Just somebody who could be Doctor Detroit,

09:49.215 --> 09:51.132
whatever the hell that is.

09:51.133 --> 09:52.176
Just a yo-yo.

09:53.678 --> 09:56.054
- Where are you gonna
find a geek like that?

09:56.055 --> 09:58.516
(funky music)

10:01.310 --> 10:04.354
- Mulligatawny soup, lamb
vindaloo, alu parathas,

10:04.355 --> 10:07.107
saag, all on the special?

10:07.108 --> 10:07.900
Perfect!

10:10.820 --> 10:12.404
- Excuse me, please.

10:12.405 --> 10:14.322
Pardon me, sir.

10:14.323 --> 10:15.156
And for you.

10:15.157 --> 10:16.199
- Guptar!

10:16.200 --> 10:17.867
- Mr. Skridlow, welcome.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.036
- Namaste.

10:20.037 --> 10:22.289
Please, this way.

10:22.290 --> 10:24.416
Mr. Skridlow, the lamb vindaloo is

10:24.417 --> 10:26.126
very, very good this evening.

10:26.127 --> 10:27.836
- That's just what I was thinking.

10:27.837 --> 10:29.004
- What a coincidence.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.047
I will bring the waiter over right away.

10:31.048 --> 10:32.382
Thank you.
- Thank you.

10:32.383 --> 10:33.425
- Thank you.

10:33.426 --> 10:34.218
Thank you.

10:36.053 --> 10:37.971
- [Jasmine] So he wears this
little sailor suit, right?

10:37.972 --> 10:38.805
- [Brillstein] Vomit.

10:38.806 --> 10:40.015
(ladies laughing)

10:40.016 --> 10:42.809
- And I do my best Flower
of the Orient number.

10:42.810 --> 10:43.643
- Jasmine!

10:43.644 --> 10:46.563
- Like it's 1931 and we're
in the long bar in Shanghai.

10:46.564 --> 10:48.774
- Mm, that sounds like fun.

10:49.734 --> 10:51.276
- Till we play find the gunboat.

10:51.277 --> 10:54.362
- Okay!
(all laughing)

10:54.363 --> 10:56.615
- Hey, isn't that the funny
looking guy with the great legs?

10:56.616 --> 10:58.158
- Ooh, yeah!

10:58.159 --> 11:00.243
Great legs, nice tushie.

11:00.244 --> 11:01.620
I think he's cute!

11:01.621 --> 11:02.579
Hi, honey!

11:02.580 --> 11:03.496
- Shh, Karen!

11:03.497 --> 11:04.456
- Oh, he didn't hear me.

11:04.457 --> 11:05.373
- Look, I don't want people...

11:05.374 --> 11:08.085
(Karen laughing)

11:11.881 --> 11:12.756
- Hiya, girls, I'm sorry I'm late.

11:12.757 --> 11:13.715
- Hi, honey.

11:13.716 --> 11:14.549
- Where have you been?

11:14.550 --> 11:15.383
- Hey, you made it.

11:15.384 --> 11:16.217
- Just barely.

11:16.218 --> 11:17.052
Uh, bourbon, no ice.

11:17.053 --> 11:17.886
Double.

11:17.887 --> 11:18.720
- What's the matter, Smoothie?

11:18.721 --> 11:19.846
You had a rough day, honey?

11:19.847 --> 11:21.389
- Nah, been talking business all day long.

11:21.390 --> 11:24.142
Just money, money, blah
blah bleh, you know.

11:24.143 --> 11:25.226
- And?

11:25.227 --> 11:27.896
- And everything is fine.

11:27.897 --> 11:29.564
Girls, girls!

11:29.565 --> 11:31.650
Look, it takes a lot of time and energy

11:31.651 --> 11:34.402
just to cover our
investments every day, okay?

11:34.403 --> 11:36.154
I don't wanna talk about it during dinner.

11:36.155 --> 11:36.988
- Okay.

11:36.989 --> 11:38.657
- Okay.
- Fine.

11:38.658 --> 11:41.702
- Hey, Smooth, look, your old friend.

11:44.580 --> 11:45.956
- Son of a bitch!

11:47.375 --> 11:49.125
- Here we are, sir.

11:49.126 --> 11:49.959
- Yeah, uh, listen,

11:49.960 --> 11:52.212
you see the guy over here?

11:52.213 --> 11:55.090
The four eyed gentleman with
his nose buried in the book?

11:55.091 --> 11:56.132
- Sir?

11:56.133 --> 11:59.219
- The guy with the seat
cover sport jacket.

11:59.220 --> 12:00.095
- Yes, sir.

12:00.096 --> 12:01.429
- I wanna buy him a drink.

12:01.430 --> 12:02.263
- Yes, sir.

12:02.264 --> 12:03.098
- No!

12:03.099 --> 12:03.932
Uh...

12:03.933 --> 12:06.142
I wanna buy him dinner.

12:06.143 --> 12:07.185
- Very good, sir.

12:07.186 --> 12:08.019
- Chop chop.

12:08.020 --> 12:10.772
- [Jasmine] Mm, generous.

12:10.773 --> 12:11.690
- Excuse me, sir,

12:11.691 --> 12:13.400
but the gentleman at
the table opposite you

12:13.401 --> 12:14.651
with the young ladies,

12:14.652 --> 12:16.820
would like you to join them for dinner.

12:16.821 --> 12:17.987
- Really?

12:17.988 --> 12:19.489
I can't believe it.

12:19.490 --> 12:20.825
- Sell it, girls.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.786
- I wonder what the man could want.

12:24.787 --> 12:27.706
Homosexual come on, maybe.

12:27.707 --> 12:29.040
No, he couldn't be gay,

12:29.041 --> 12:31.668
not with all those beautiful women.

12:31.669 --> 12:35.130
And even if he is, maybe they're not.

12:35.131 --> 12:37.632
What harm in accepting
the man's hospitality?

12:37.633 --> 12:41.469
But no free lunch in this world, say I.

12:41.470 --> 12:43.513
I can thank him, though.

12:43.514 --> 12:44.931
Yes.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.307
Yes, I'll thank him.

12:46.308 --> 12:48.769
That's the decent thing to do.

12:52.773 --> 12:55.692
Uh, this is most unexpected.

12:55.693 --> 12:57.153
Uh, do I know you?

12:58.237 --> 13:02.407
Perhaps you were in my Comp
Lit 101 class at Monroe?

13:02.408 --> 13:04.325
- I don't believe so.

13:04.326 --> 13:05.535
- Excuse me.

13:05.536 --> 13:06.786
I'm Jasmine.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.329
- Yeah, and I'm totally thoughtless.

13:08.330 --> 13:10.498
Allow me to introduce everyone.

13:10.499 --> 13:12.041
This is Karen.

13:12.042 --> 13:14.043
And I'm Smooth Walker.

13:14.044 --> 13:15.628
This is Monica.
- Hello.

13:15.629 --> 13:16.838
- Jasmine, of course,

13:16.839 --> 13:19.215
and this is Thelma.

13:19.216 --> 13:20.049
And you are?

13:20.050 --> 13:21.426
- Uh, Clifford Skridlow.

13:21.427 --> 13:23.344
My friends call me Cliff.

13:23.345 --> 13:24.429
- Cliff!

13:24.430 --> 13:25.764
Oh, how cute!

13:25.765 --> 13:27.766
(all laughing)

13:27.767 --> 13:29.976
- Well, join us, Cliff.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.561
- Uh, well, I...

13:31.562 --> 13:32.687
I've already ordered, uh...

13:32.688 --> 13:34.397
- Why don't I have Mr. Skridlow's dinner

13:34.398 --> 13:35.940
brought to this table?

13:35.941 --> 13:36.775
- Why don't you?

13:36.776 --> 13:37.568
- Great.

13:39.195 --> 13:40.028
- Uh...

13:40.029 --> 13:42.280
- Here comes that chair,
Cliff, just slip right in.

13:42.281 --> 13:44.699
We'll have another fresh drink
for our new friend, Cliff.

13:44.700 --> 13:47.410
- Oh, how very gracious of you.

13:47.411 --> 13:51.164
- Can you tell us anything at
all about this tandoori thing?

13:51.165 --> 13:52.832
- Oh, you ordered the tandoori?

13:52.833 --> 13:54.834
Well, uh, you're going to enjoy it.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.377
It's really a marvelous technique.

13:56.378 --> 13:58.671
It's a miniature clay
oven, completely enclosed,

13:58.672 --> 14:01.424
a marinade and the heat of the oven

14:01.425 --> 14:04.636
and the enclosure on
top, keeps the juices in

14:04.637 --> 14:08.807
and uh, thus causes the
meat to come out pink.

14:08.808 --> 14:10.183
- Ooh, I love it!

14:10.184 --> 14:12.978
- (laughs) Karen!

14:15.272 --> 14:16.105
- Thank you for coming, sir.

14:16.106 --> 14:17.190
- Thank you, my good man.

14:17.191 --> 14:19.150
- That was good.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.401
- I got it, honey.

14:20.402 --> 14:21.236
- Here's your car, Mr. Walker.

14:21.237 --> 14:22.070
(snaps fingers)

14:22.071 --> 14:23.614
- Come on, come on.

14:24.657 --> 14:25.657
- Ooh!

14:25.658 --> 14:27.575
Fresh air gives one a decided lift.

14:27.576 --> 14:28.660
- Doesn't it? (laughs)

14:28.661 --> 14:30.453
- Well, I'm off to the Cinema Obscura,

14:30.454 --> 14:31.955
it's the last night of the Satyajit Ray

14:31.956 --> 14:33.039
Pather Panchali trilogy and uh...

14:33.040 --> 14:34.249
- No, no, no.

14:34.250 --> 14:35.291
- I'd like to catch it, so thank you.

14:35.292 --> 14:36.376
- Cliff, Cliff, don't worry about it.

14:36.377 --> 14:38.419
I got the whole thing on video cassette.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.046
Pather Panchali, the whole trilogy,

14:40.047 --> 14:42.298
Deep Throat, E.T., you name it!

14:42.299 --> 14:43.092
- Ah.

14:44.218 --> 14:45.218
Thank you.

14:45.219 --> 14:46.052
- Hey, man--

14:46.053 --> 14:46.886
- Thank you, Diavolo, the door.

14:46.887 --> 14:47.720
- But wait, boss, ain't this the geek--

14:47.721 --> 14:50.723
- Yes, yes, this is
Professor Clifford Skridlow.

14:50.724 --> 14:51.558
- Ow!
- How do you do?

14:51.559 --> 14:55.228
- He is an expert on chivalry,
honor, literature, uh...

14:55.229 --> 14:56.312
Indian cuisine!

14:56.313 --> 14:58.731
- Ah, don't forget power
walking, systems analysis,

14:58.732 --> 14:59.774
rock climbing.

14:59.775 --> 15:01.150
- And what about erotic adventure?

15:01.151 --> 15:02.193
- I never said that.

15:02.194 --> 15:03.027
- So?

15:03.028 --> 15:04.112
Think about it.

15:04.113 --> 15:06.322
- (laughs) Shall we be going then?

15:06.323 --> 15:07.156
- Come on.

15:07.157 --> 15:07.991
Come on!

15:07.992 --> 15:09.284
- [Thelma] Yeah, we'll
have a wonderful time.

15:09.285 --> 15:11.661
(Clifford stammering)

15:11.662 --> 15:13.705
And you look like you need
a little company, right?

15:13.706 --> 15:15.164
- [Karen] Yeah, get in, get in.

15:15.165 --> 15:16.833
Would you get your ass in the car?

doesn't do anything to me

16:56.308 --> 16:57.892
and I've tried.

16:57.893 --> 17:01.020
- Oh, yeah, you're just
Mr. Natural, aren't you?

Let's get high on life,
the body is a temple, huh?

17:04.148 --> 17:06.818

- It's all right, sweetheart.

18:02.875 --> 18:04.000
- He was...
- Uh-huh, I read that.

18:04.001 --> 18:04.876
- A real nut.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.085
- I know!

18:06.086 --> 18:07.378
- He was mad.
- Really?

18:07.379 --> 18:08.713
- No, no.

18:08.714 --> 18:10.506
- Oh, come on!

18:10.507 --> 18:12.675
- It'll make you feel so good.

18:12.676 --> 18:13.509
- No.

18:13.510 --> 18:14.303
- Ooh!

Hold it, hold it.

18:20.059 --> 18:20.975

18:41.538 --> 18:43.790

18:43.791 --> 18:45.208
It doesn't affect me.

18:45.209 --> 18:46.585

19:03.769 --> 19:06.230
- Very perceptive.
- Thank you.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.566
- Welcome home. (laughing)

19:10.567 --> 19:11.609
- Wow!

19:11.610 --> 19:12.860
Look at this place!

19:12.861 --> 19:14.821
It's positively vulgar!

19:14.822 --> 19:17.366
You must be so incredibly rich!

19:20.160 --> 19:20.993
Hey, what?

19:20.994 --> 19:22.495
Your art collection, it's on the...

19:22.496 --> 19:24.789
Oh, why you've purposely...

19:24.790 --> 19:25.915
Because...

19:25.916 --> 19:27.416
Chicago!

19:27.417 --> 19:29.127
- Your kinda town.

19:29.128 --> 19:30.795
(Thelma laughing)

19:30.796 --> 19:32.421
- Yes!

19:32.422 --> 19:33.215
But...

19:34.758 --> 19:35.800
Where am I?

19:35.801 --> 19:37.051
- You're right here.

19:37.052 --> 19:37.885
- Where's here?

19:37.886 --> 19:40.304
- Well, here is where it's at.

19:40.305 --> 19:41.139
- Oh!

19:41.140 --> 19:43.432
Now, come on, don't give me any of that

19:43.433 --> 19:44.767
freshman philosophy crap.

19:44.768 --> 19:46.978
I'm talking existential being!

19:46.979 --> 19:49.940
- Well, of course you are, gorgeous.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.483
- You're very pretty.

19:52.484 --> 19:54.193
Like a bright little bug.

19:54.194 --> 19:55.778
(Karen laughs)

19:55.779 --> 19:56.822
Ah, a dragon!

19:58.907 --> 20:00.491
- Say, boss, check it out.

20:00.492 --> 20:02.743
You got my man over here trippin'.

20:02.744 --> 20:04.745
Dude is tripping, what'd
you give this dude?

20:04.746 --> 20:06.664
- Stay down in front with the car.

20:06.665 --> 20:07.957
- Say what?

20:07.958 --> 20:08.791
I thought you said I could

20:08.792 --> 20:10.209
take the rest of the night off, man!

20:10.210 --> 20:12.336
- Sure, but in the car.

20:12.337 --> 20:13.130
- Oh!

20:16.842 --> 20:17.675
(Diavolo shouts)

20:17.676 --> 20:20.470
(Clifford laughs)

20:21.388 --> 20:24.182
- Look, what utterly
tasteless furnishings!

20:24.183 --> 20:24.975
- Cliff.

20:30.689 --> 20:33.734
(breathless moaning)

20:46.246 --> 20:51.168
- (coughing) So, you're in
the entertainment business.

20:52.085 --> 20:54.629
- Well, you could call us public servants.

20:54.630 --> 20:55.546
Don't we look it?

20:55.547 --> 20:57.089
(ladies laughing)

20:57.090 --> 21:00.426
- You know, I think
Cliffie is a little tense.

21:00.427 --> 21:02.511
Perhaps a hot bath?

21:02.512 --> 21:03.638
- Uh...

21:03.639 --> 21:04.472
- Oh yeah!

21:04.473 --> 21:05.514
- No, no. (laughs)

21:05.515 --> 21:06.891
I don't think it's tension.

21:06.892 --> 21:08.517
I think it's more fatigue.

21:08.518 --> 21:12.481
I really should be going,
it's far past my usual

21:13.982 --> 21:15.608
bed time.

21:15.609 --> 21:18.110
And let's just say I'm...

21:18.111 --> 21:19.904
I'm not tense.

21:19.905 --> 21:20.780
- Yes, you are.

21:20.781 --> 21:22.490
I could feel it Cliff, right up in your--

21:22.491 --> 21:24.951
(Cliff moans)

21:24.952 --> 21:27.620
- My latissimus dorsi, you're so right.

21:27.621 --> 21:30.539
- It's only natural on a night
that could change your life.

21:30.540 --> 21:33.209
- (sighs) Nothing's gonna change my life.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.627
My life is set.

21:34.628 --> 21:36.838
What could possibly happen?

21:40.300 --> 21:43.344
- How'd you like to
come into this business?

21:43.345 --> 21:45.429
- The entertainment business?

21:45.430 --> 21:47.056
- Exactly!

21:47.057 --> 21:50.434
All I wanna do is share my good fortune,

21:50.435 --> 21:53.145
my involvement with other people,

21:53.146 --> 21:53.939
my world.

21:55.649 --> 21:56.942
- Ah, well, I...

21:58.360 --> 22:00.695
I don't know.
(bubbling)

22:00.696 --> 22:02.947
See, I have a business.

22:02.948 --> 22:05.116
I teach comparative
literature at Monroe College.

22:05.117 --> 22:07.785
I'm a full assistant professor now, I...

22:07.786 --> 22:09.412
My father's Chancellor of the College,

22:09.413 --> 22:11.247
I'm committed.

22:11.248 --> 22:15.042
- Think about it, Cliffie,
just think about it.

22:15.043 --> 22:16.877
Your own business.

22:16.878 --> 22:20.423
Your piece of the American dream.

22:20.424 --> 22:24.635
Nice company pad, the best employee roster

22:24.636 --> 22:26.887
this side of heaven.

22:26.888 --> 22:29.433
Thelma, Karen, Monica, Jasmine.

22:32.019 --> 22:33.853
Now, that's entertainment.

22:33.854 --> 22:37.315
And they'd all be working for you.

22:37.316 --> 22:38.275
All for you.

22:40.110 --> 22:40.902
- I...

22:42.195 --> 22:44.030
It's all very sudden, I...

22:44.031 --> 22:46.907
I have responsibilities, I...

22:46.908 --> 22:47.659
- Well...

22:48.785 --> 22:51.662
(remote control clicks)
Soak.

22:51.663 --> 22:54.374
(heavenly music)

23:03.300 --> 23:04.509
Think about it.

23:11.350 --> 23:12.850
Relax.

23:12.851 --> 23:13.643
Enjoy.

23:14.644 --> 23:16.020
- Oh, yeah!

23:16.021 --> 23:16.813
Yeah!

23:19.983 --> 23:20.776
Oh!

23:21.860 --> 23:24.904
ETA to splashdown, two seconds!

23:24.905 --> 23:26.197
(splashing)

23:26.198 --> 23:28.992
(ladies laughing)

23:34.206 --> 23:36.082
(blowing raspberries)

23:36.083 --> 23:40.127
You dark burnished thing, you! (laughs)

23:40.128 --> 23:41.754
Oh, you beauties!

23:41.755 --> 23:44.632
- Ooh, your legs are so
muscular for a teacher!

23:44.633 --> 23:45.925
Do you exercise?

23:45.926 --> 23:48.094
- Well, as a teacher I stand a lot.

23:48.095 --> 23:50.137
- Listen, sweetheart, do you think we can

23:50.138 --> 23:53.307
use battery operated devices underwater?

23:53.308 --> 23:54.141
- Yes!

23:54.142 --> 23:56.936
Use them! (laughing)

23:56.937 --> 24:00.732
- I can show you how to
play find the gunboat!

24:03.068 --> 24:05.277
- This is the best time I've ever had

24:05.278 --> 24:06.904
in my entire life!

24:06.905 --> 24:08.572
Do you hear me world?

24:08.573 --> 24:12.119
My entire life! (laughing)

24:24.506 --> 24:25.923
- You gonna make it, man?

24:25.924 --> 24:27.174
- Oh yeah, thank you.

24:27.175 --> 24:28.008
I think so.

24:28.009 --> 24:30.178
Thank you.

24:32.472 --> 24:34.433
- Take care, my brother.

24:46.736 --> 24:49.614
(shoes squelching)

24:54.995 --> 24:56.037
- Hello, son.

24:57.456 --> 24:59.415
- Hello, Father.

24:59.416 --> 25:00.666
That's a late night.

25:00.667 --> 25:02.585
- Uh, I guess, a little.

25:02.586 --> 25:04.629
- Good morning, Clifford!

25:05.589 --> 25:07.006
Breakfast, anyone?

25:07.007 --> 25:08.132
- [Mr. Skridlow] No, none for me.

25:08.133 --> 25:09.091
- Oh, of course not.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.968
You're probably going to
starve yourself to death.

25:10.969 --> 25:13.095
(laughing)

25:13.096 --> 25:15.222
- What makes you think
that I'd take my own life?

25:15.223 --> 25:18.476
- Oh, I was speaking figuratively, dear.

25:18.477 --> 25:20.102
But these financial statements.

25:20.103 --> 25:21.937
Clifford, cash your paycheck quickly.

25:21.938 --> 25:22.813
- Margaret.

25:22.814 --> 25:24.440
(stammering) Would you please excuse me?

25:24.441 --> 25:26.942
That is private business
between the trustees and me.

25:26.943 --> 25:28.819
- Forget it, everything's peachy.

25:28.820 --> 25:31.238
Harmon Rousehorn, I'm
gonna call him and tell him

25:31.239 --> 25:33.073
to cancel his visit, we don't
need his endowment check!

25:33.074 --> 25:34.658
- Don't you dare.

25:34.659 --> 25:35.493
(Mrs. Skridlow laughing)

25:35.494 --> 25:36.827
My God!

25:36.828 --> 25:41.707
- Oh, honestly, some people
just can't take a joke.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.417
I'm gonna water my begonias.

25:43.418 --> 25:45.836
(Mrs. Skridlow humming)

25:45.837 --> 25:48.339
- Well, I would prefer for
you to hear it from me.

25:48.340 --> 25:50.132
But without the Rousehorn endowment check,

25:50.133 --> 25:52.676
this college can't even
meet its current payroll.

25:52.677 --> 25:54.470
- But we are getting the check.

25:54.471 --> 25:56.680
I mean, Rousehorn's coming
in to present it himself.

25:56.681 --> 25:57.848
It's a major endowment.

25:57.849 --> 25:59.016
It's in the press.

25:59.017 --> 26:00.976
- Look, son, without that check,

26:00.977 --> 26:05.105
Monday next the banks are
gonna close this college down.

26:05.106 --> 26:07.066
Close it down!

26:07.067 --> 26:10.986
A hundred years of
scholarship and public service

26:10.987 --> 26:12.030
shot to shit.

26:13.406 --> 26:14.740
- I've got to go up and get some winks

26:14.741 --> 26:17.117
before my eleven o'clock lecture.

26:17.118 --> 26:18.702
- You've got a nine o'clock.

26:18.703 --> 26:19.537
- Is today Wednesday?

26:19.538 --> 26:20.746
- [Mr. Skridlow] Yes, Wednesday.

26:20.747 --> 26:23.041
- I thought it was Thursday!

26:26.169 --> 26:27.545
- [Girl] Marianne!

26:27.546 --> 26:28.671
- [Boy] Hey, Thomas, there's no class!

26:28.672 --> 26:29.505
- Excuse me, please!

26:29.506 --> 26:30.881
Thank you.

26:30.882 --> 26:32.341
Morning.

26:32.342 --> 26:33.509
(students chattering)

26:33.510 --> 26:34.343
Ah, places please.

26:34.344 --> 26:35.594
Let's begin.

26:35.595 --> 26:36.888
Sorry, I'm late.

26:38.473 --> 26:40.849
We were discussing the
hero's role in chivalry

26:40.850 --> 26:43.060
as exemplified by the
character of Lancelot

26:43.061 --> 26:46.772
in Sir Thomas Mallory's Morte d'Arthur.

26:46.773 --> 26:49.441
Entranced by Arthur's Queen Guinevere,

26:49.442 --> 26:52.570
Lancelot, a knight of impeccable virtue,

26:52.571 --> 26:56.532
faces a crisis as his idee
fixe confronts his libido.

26:56.533 --> 26:57.950
Any comments?

26:57.951 --> 26:59.827
Mr. Frankman.

26:59.828 --> 27:03.039
What do you think of Lancelot's crisis?

27:04.457 --> 27:07.459
- Well, I think Lancelot was an idiot.

27:07.460 --> 27:08.627
- Mr. Frankman, how long have you been

27:08.628 --> 27:10.963
in the first year program?

27:10.964 --> 27:12.298
- Four years.

27:12.299 --> 27:14.466
(students laughing)

27:14.467 --> 27:17.094
- Duty, selfless honor, chastity,

27:17.095 --> 27:20.139
humility, purity, a
devotion to a greater good.

27:20.140 --> 27:21.724
I mean, by now don't any of these things

27:21.725 --> 27:23.435
mean anything to you?

27:25.353 --> 27:28.814
(sighs) All together now.

27:28.815 --> 27:31.734
What is the chivalric ideal?

27:31.735 --> 27:34.361
- [All] The Chivalric ideal is one of duty

27:34.362 --> 27:38.449
to a higher cause in
which purity and chastity

27:38.450 --> 27:41.035
are virtues and manly strength and honor

27:41.036 --> 27:42.995
are devoted to their preservation.

27:42.996 --> 27:44.538
- [Student] And justice for all.

27:44.539 --> 27:48.125
(sirens blaring)

27:48.126 --> 27:50.336
- Just let it out, though,
get to your real feelings.

27:50.337 --> 27:51.211
How does it feel in there?

27:51.212 --> 27:52.463
- Hey, man, I feel lousy.

27:52.464 --> 27:53.297
- Lousy.

27:53.298 --> 27:54.131
- I feel shitty.
- Mm-hmm.

27:54.132 --> 27:55.215
- I feel pissed off.

27:55.216 --> 27:56.175
- Violent, hostile?

27:56.176 --> 27:57.718
- Yeah, a little.
- Great!

27:57.719 --> 27:58.552
Hit me!

27:58.553 --> 28:00.596
- Hey, man, I can't do that!

28:00.597 --> 28:02.014
- What?

28:02.015 --> 28:03.724
Look, you can.

28:03.725 --> 28:04.558
You want to.

28:04.559 --> 28:06.101
You have to.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.519
I need it!
(shirt ripping)

28:07.520 --> 28:08.437
- Hey, man, what's wrong with you?

28:08.438 --> 28:09.772
You getting a little kinky?

28:09.773 --> 28:11.190
'Cause if you are it's gonna
cost you a little extra,

28:11.191 --> 28:12.900
I learned that from the girls.

28:12.901 --> 28:14.068
- They learned that from me

28:14.069 --> 28:16.403
and that has nothing to do with this!

28:16.404 --> 28:19.698
Now, look, Diavolo, for once,
do what I tell you to do

28:19.699 --> 28:21.241
and try to do it right!

28:21.242 --> 28:22.202
Now, hit me!

28:23.411 --> 28:24.411
- Say, man, what's wrong with you, man?

28:24.412 --> 28:25.245
You going crazy or something?

28:25.246 --> 28:26.080
I can't hit you.

28:26.081 --> 28:27.122
You want me to call a doctor?

28:27.123 --> 28:28.707
I ain't hitting you, man!
- Okay!

28:28.708 --> 28:30.000
Okay.

28:30.001 --> 28:32.086
I'll make it real easy for you.

28:32.087 --> 28:34.838
I got everything, you got nothing, right?

28:34.839 --> 28:38.092
I'm the boss, you ain't jack shit.

28:38.093 --> 28:39.635
I am white.

28:39.636 --> 28:41.637
I don't even know what you are.

28:41.638 --> 28:43.013
- Say, man, I'm black.

28:43.014 --> 28:44.098
- All right, then try to remember

28:44.099 --> 28:47.101
that my grandfather
owned your grandfather.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.061
- Your mama!

28:49.145 --> 28:50.938
- That's good, Diavolo, that's good.

28:50.939 --> 28:52.898
Oh, my back!
- Uh-huh, your ass!

28:52.899 --> 28:54.108
- [Smooth] Now, take it easy!

28:54.109 --> 28:54.942
Take it easy!

28:54.943 --> 28:55.776
Not the teeth!

28:55.777 --> 28:56.985
- Say, don't tell me what to do!

28:56.986 --> 28:57.986
You want me to kick your ass

28:57.987 --> 29:00.906
and I'm gonna kick your
white motherfuckin' ass!

29:00.907 --> 29:02.282
- [Smooth] Thank you!

29:02.283 --> 29:03.993
Thank you, thank you!

29:08.498 --> 29:09.290
- Hmm.

29:12.293 --> 29:13.169
- Oh, nice.

29:14.462 --> 29:18.257
Black eye, lacerations,
multiple contusions.

29:18.258 --> 29:23.053
Hey, what'd you do, try to
roll a sailor? (laughing)

29:23.054 --> 29:24.431
- Doctor Detroit.

29:25.682 --> 29:26.807
He's bad, Mom.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.475
Really bad.

29:28.476 --> 29:30.728
Mom, I gotta get outta town.

29:30.729 --> 29:32.354
Now, you heavies can settle this shit,

29:32.355 --> 29:34.983
just leave old Smooth out of it.

29:36.568 --> 29:37.860
- You mean that's it?

29:37.861 --> 29:40.279
A couple of broken ribs,
you're ready to cave in?

29:40.280 --> 29:43.615
Gee, with a partner like
you, who needs enemies?

29:43.616 --> 29:44.659
- Adios, Mom.

29:46.995 --> 29:48.579
And believe me.

29:48.580 --> 29:51.749
You deserve to get every
bit of your cash back.

29:51.750 --> 29:53.584
It's just that...

29:53.585 --> 29:54.878
I don't have it.

29:57.589 --> 29:59.840
See Doctor Detroit, he's...

29:59.841 --> 30:02.968
(winces) He's your man.

30:02.969 --> 30:03.762
Oh, god.

30:06.181 --> 30:07.264
- Give me that shit.

30:07.265 --> 30:08.348
- Are you kidding?

30:08.349 --> 30:09.642
- He's for real.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.936
- I gotta find out more about this Doctor.

30:12.937 --> 30:15.606
Hey, what's that black
chick who works for Smooth?

30:15.607 --> 30:17.524
- Um, Thelma.

30:17.525 --> 30:18.859
- Get her busted.

30:18.860 --> 30:19.943
I wanna see just how good this Doctor

30:19.944 --> 30:21.445
takes care of his people.

30:21.446 --> 30:22.404
- She's busted.

30:22.405 --> 30:23.531
- Let's do it.

30:28.828 --> 30:29.912
(funky music)

30:29.913 --> 30:30.913
- Look out, asshole!

30:30.914 --> 30:34.291
Thank you, ma'am, thank you. (laughing)

30:34.292 --> 30:35.084
Oh, yes.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.881
- Okay, Mr. Finkelman.

30:40.882 --> 30:44.301
Uh, we have you one way
first class Air Togo

30:44.302 --> 30:46.637
to the Cook Islands

30:46.638 --> 30:49.265
then local service to Rarotonga.

30:51.017 --> 30:53.018
Are you sure you want this just one way?

30:53.019 --> 30:53.852
- Right, sweetheart.

30:53.853 --> 30:55.396
One way, no return.

30:57.524 --> 30:59.274
- In the financial briefing you'll see

30:59.275 --> 31:01.068
that each person has their own report

31:01.069 --> 31:02.236
as well as what is there.

31:02.237 --> 31:03.403
- Now, Arthur, if we
could just move forward--

31:03.404 --> 31:04.696
(gavel banging)

31:04.697 --> 31:06.323
- Now, may I have your attention, please,

31:06.324 --> 31:08.283
to item six on the agenda,

31:08.284 --> 31:10.452
which is the alumni dinner.

31:10.453 --> 31:12.955
As customary, we will be
at the Excelsior Hotel

31:12.956 --> 31:14.915
in the Orchid Room.

31:14.916 --> 31:17.501
Cliff will introduce Harmon Rousehorn.

31:17.502 --> 31:18.335
Cliff!

31:18.336 --> 31:19.169
(Cliff snorts)

31:19.170 --> 31:20.337
Cliff, may we have your attention, please?

31:20.338 --> 31:21.755
- Oh, um...

31:21.756 --> 31:22.882
Ah, I'm sorry.

31:23.758 --> 31:25.968
Uh, go ahead, sir.

31:25.969 --> 31:28.053
- Uh, the President Emeritus will present

31:28.054 --> 31:30.097
the honorary degree.

31:30.098 --> 31:33.016
Mr. Rousehorn will make
a few brief remarks

31:33.017 --> 31:34.601
and then present the college with

31:34.602 --> 31:37.479
the endowment check for
the Harold Robbins Chair.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.564
Are there any questions?

31:38.565 --> 31:39.773
- Will there be a fruit cup?

31:39.774 --> 31:40.691
- Yes.
- [Man] Oh, yes.

31:40.692 --> 31:42.693
- Oh, will there be a
choice of vegetables?

31:42.694 --> 31:43.610
- No.

31:43.611 --> 31:45.237
- Last year there wasn't any fruit cup.

31:45.238 --> 31:46.822
- No.
- And the shrimp were off.

31:46.823 --> 31:47.656
(telephone ringing)

31:47.657 --> 31:51.076
- This year there will be a fruit cup.

31:51.077 --> 31:53.078
Uh, this is Chancellor Skridlow.

31:53.079 --> 31:54.496
- [Jasmine] Hello, Cliff?

31:54.497 --> 31:55.664
Cliff?

31:55.665 --> 31:57.291
- Uh, Cliff, I believe this is for you.

31:57.292 --> 31:59.334
Would you please make it snappy, son?

31:59.335 --> 32:00.544
- Uh, this is "Criff."

32:00.545 --> 32:01.461
Uh, Cliff.

32:01.462 --> 32:02.629
- [Jasmine] Cliff, good morning.

32:02.630 --> 32:04.464
I'm still tingling from last night.

32:04.465 --> 32:06.008
Oh, but something terrible has happened,

32:06.009 --> 32:06.842
you have to help me!

32:06.843 --> 32:10.262
- (stammering) Well, um,
Miss Wu, I'm in a meeting.

32:10.263 --> 32:13.557
Uh, perhaps we could
discuss this in class.

32:13.558 --> 32:14.850
- [Jasmine] Class?
- [Karen] Class, my ass!

32:14.851 --> 32:15.809
Give me that.

32:15.810 --> 32:16.769
- Excuse me.

32:18.313 --> 32:19.522
Uh, what is it?

32:20.815 --> 32:22.649
- [Jasmine] Thelma's in
jail and Smooth's gone,

32:22.650 --> 32:23.734
so you gotta help her.

32:23.735 --> 32:24.860
- [Karen] Give me that phone!

32:24.861 --> 32:27.362
Hi, Cliff, it's me, Karen.

32:27.363 --> 32:28.655
Listen, first things first,

32:28.656 --> 32:30.616
you're gonna have to get
over here as fast as you can

32:30.617 --> 32:32.159
and help us out because
this is a big emergency.

32:32.160 --> 32:33.160
- I've no time, thank you.

32:33.161 --> 32:35.662
I'm so sorry for the interruption.

32:35.663 --> 32:37.414
- So are we.

32:37.415 --> 32:39.625
Now, obviously there is no need to stress

32:39.626 --> 32:42.878
the importance of the
Rousehorn endowment--

32:42.879 --> 32:45.255
(telephone rings)

32:45.256 --> 32:46.089
Hello?

32:46.090 --> 32:47.925
- [Karen] Hey, Cliff,
what's the big idea, anyway?

32:47.926 --> 32:50.844
I mean, you know, after last
night a person would think,

32:50.845 --> 32:53.096
well uh, what, were you using us?

32:53.097 --> 32:55.849
- Uh, listen, I'm in a very
important meeting right now

32:55.850 --> 32:57.476
with the faculty of my college,

32:57.477 --> 32:59.895
including my father, the Chancellor.

32:59.896 --> 33:00.938
- [Monica] Uh, Cliff?

33:00.939 --> 33:01.980
- [Karen] He's talking about his father.

33:01.981 --> 33:02.814
- [Monica] Shut up.

33:02.815 --> 33:03.941
This is Monica.

33:03.942 --> 33:04.775
Birthmark.

33:04.776 --> 33:06.902
- Uh, excuse me!

33:06.903 --> 33:08.654
Uh... (clears throat)

33:08.655 --> 33:09.488
(staffers muttering)

33:09.489 --> 33:10.322
- [Monica] Okay, now listen.

33:10.323 --> 33:12.783
I sent Diavolo with the car.

33:12.784 --> 33:14.451
- Uh, yo, is Cliff Skridlow here?

33:14.452 --> 33:15.494
Cliff, what's happening?

33:15.495 --> 33:17.412
Hey, man, I'm double parked outside, man.

33:17.413 --> 33:18.664
- Well, you'll just have to wait.

33:18.665 --> 33:21.041
What the hell is going
on around here anyway?

33:21.042 --> 33:22.584
- Uh, he just got here.

33:22.585 --> 33:23.418
- [Staffer] Faculty only!

33:23.419 --> 33:25.545
- Uh, I'm so sorry about
these interruptions.

33:25.546 --> 33:27.005
- Are we still in session
or is this a coffee break?

33:27.006 --> 33:28.465
- No, we are still in session.

33:28.466 --> 33:29.299
- And we gotta go, bro.

33:29.300 --> 33:30.133
- [Monica] Well, are you?

33:30.134 --> 33:30.968
- I'm coming.

33:30.969 --> 33:31.802
I'm coming.

33:31.803 --> 33:32.636
I'll be there.

33:32.637 --> 33:36.015
Don't worry about a thing, I'm on my way.

33:37.392 --> 33:40.394
Vietnamese girl distraught, distressed.

33:40.395 --> 33:41.478
Uh, urgent.

33:41.479 --> 33:43.480
Needs immediate faculty counseling.

33:43.481 --> 33:44.564
Uh, I'll be back.

33:44.565 --> 33:45.565
- [Staffer] Why, of course.

33:45.566 --> 33:48.194
(siren blaring)

34:05.086 --> 34:06.461
- 301.

34:06.462 --> 34:08.755
Robert E. Lee Davis-Jackson.

34:10.425 --> 34:12.342
- I don't wanna hear anymore about it!

34:12.342 --> 34:14.719
Every time I turn around
you're up here in front of me

34:14.721 --> 34:16.554
on a traffic violation.

34:16.556 --> 34:18.181
And if it happens one more time,

34:18.181 --> 34:20.308
you're gonna be spending
your declining years

34:20.309 --> 34:21.351
in the slammer!

34:21.351 --> 34:22.643
Now, get outta here.

34:22.645 --> 34:23.438
Next case.

34:24.355 --> 34:26.940
- Ugh, Southern tyrant.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.150
- Uh...

34:28.150 --> 34:30.360
Pardon me, are you looking for a lawyer?

34:30.360 --> 34:31.695
- Uh, no.

34:31.696 --> 34:33.780
- Well, uh, would you like
to discuss it over a drink?

34:33.781 --> 34:35.157
I know a wonderful, cozy little bar off--

34:35.158 --> 34:35.991
- No, no thank you.

34:35.992 --> 34:37.701
I have business with the court.

34:37.702 --> 34:38.534
Thanks anyway.

34:38.536 --> 34:39.328
- Hmm.

34:46.793 --> 34:49.505
(loudly chewing)

34:52.175 --> 34:55.010
(paper rustling)

34:55.011 --> 34:55.844
- Well, excuse me.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.678
- Mm-hmm?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.930
- Sir, I have a business
proposition for you.

34:58.931 --> 34:59.765
- Mm-hmm.

34:59.766 --> 35:02.142
- Would you be willing to, uh, part with

35:02.143 --> 35:05.228
certain elements of your unique wardrobe

35:05.229 --> 35:07.230
for a cash retainer?

35:07.231 --> 35:08.732
- (chuckles) I mean...

35:08.733 --> 35:10.484
Sell my clothes?

35:10.485 --> 35:11.277
Come on.

35:12.320 --> 35:13.403
If, uh, look, I mean...

35:13.404 --> 35:16.114
If there were thoughts in that direction,

35:16.115 --> 35:17.115
I mean, what...

35:17.116 --> 35:19.618
What sort of offer are
we kinda talking about?

35:19.619 --> 35:21.119
- Well, I wouldn't want to insult you.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.205
- Uh, you can't insult me.

35:23.206 --> 35:24.831
You see, I'm a lawyer.

35:24.832 --> 35:26.208
Talk best price.

35:26.209 --> 35:27.876
- [Judge] I have repeatedly warned counsel

35:27.877 --> 35:29.628
not to provoke the court with--

35:29.629 --> 35:30.962
- This department 20 and one?

35:30.963 --> 35:31.797
- Shh!

35:31.798 --> 35:32.839
Quiet in the court.

35:32.840 --> 35:35.634
- Step aside, lackey, or
you'll be eatin' my boot.

35:35.635 --> 35:36.843
(gavel banging)

35:36.844 --> 35:38.512
- What is going on?

35:38.513 --> 35:39.679
- Exactly, Your Honor!

35:39.680 --> 35:41.264
What is going on?

35:41.265 --> 35:42.682
When a flower of the South,

35:42.683 --> 35:45.352
a decent girl with a
beautiful, good family,

35:45.353 --> 35:47.229
is arrested on her way home

35:47.230 --> 35:48.647
from her niece's confirmation

35:48.648 --> 35:50.565
and booked and incarcerated like a common

35:50.566 --> 35:52.567
woman of the streets?

35:52.568 --> 35:54.402
I'm talking about Thelma Cleland

35:54.403 --> 35:55.779
of the Cleland Parrish Clelands of

35:55.780 --> 35:57.364
Bay St. Luke, Louisiana.

35:57.365 --> 35:58.240
Excuse me.

35:58.241 --> 36:01.118
Where her father, Colonel
Judge Bryant Cleland

36:01.119 --> 36:03.995
presides over the Cleland
County Fifth Circuit Bench.

36:03.996 --> 36:06.581
Now, I demand that you
release this girl right now

36:06.582 --> 36:08.959
or you'll all taste the
business end of a buggy whip!

36:08.960 --> 36:09.793
- Bailiff!

36:09.794 --> 36:10.627
- Yes sir?

36:10.628 --> 36:12.212
- [Judge] Get your ass over here!

36:12.213 --> 36:13.380
- You've got a case number?

36:13.381 --> 36:14.841
- Hell, yes, I do.

36:16.175 --> 36:19.887
It's 20569er, A Alpha R Ranger.

36:20.888 --> 36:21.721
- [Bailiff] I'll get her.

36:21.722 --> 36:22.681
- Shh!

36:22.682 --> 36:25.642
Now, just exactly what
is your relationship

36:25.643 --> 36:26.893
to the arrestee?

36:26.894 --> 36:30.814
- Well, sir, the young woman is my sister.

36:30.815 --> 36:32.065
And I know you can believe

36:32.066 --> 36:34.818
that the family honor is at stake here.

36:34.819 --> 36:37.487
You strike me as a gentleman, sir.

36:37.488 --> 36:38.989
Surely you must understand.

36:38.990 --> 36:41.158
- Why, of course I understand.

36:41.159 --> 36:43.577
My people were related to Jefferson Davis

36:43.578 --> 36:45.662
on my mother's side.

36:45.663 --> 36:47.581
- I knew it! (laughs)

36:47.582 --> 36:50.417
I knew it, indeed I knew
it, a son of the South!

36:50.418 --> 36:51.251
- Son of what?

36:51.252 --> 36:52.586
- Of the South, sir!

36:52.587 --> 36:54.254
The Confederacy.

36:54.255 --> 36:55.130
- [Bailiff] Uh, Your Honor.

36:55.131 --> 36:55.964
- What?

36:55.965 --> 36:58.717
- Loitering with intent
to commit prostitution.

36:58.718 --> 37:01.303
Lewd behavior, soliciting
for an unlawful act,

37:01.304 --> 37:04.139
bail at uh, 350 dollars, Your Honor.

37:04.140 --> 37:06.016
- I can't believe my
ears, this is an outrage!

37:06.017 --> 37:06.850
Let me see that thing!

37:06.851 --> 37:08.476
I mean, this is outrageous, ridiculous!

37:08.477 --> 37:09.519
Let me see that!

37:09.520 --> 37:11.313
Why, I demand satisfaction!

37:11.314 --> 37:12.814
Get the arresting officer in here!

37:12.815 --> 37:14.900
I will tar and feather the scalawag!

37:14.901 --> 37:16.651
- Now, hold on, Mr. Cleland.

37:16.652 --> 37:17.445
Hold on.

37:18.446 --> 37:21.198
I can release your sister
on her own recognizance

37:21.199 --> 37:24.868
and dismiss this case in
the interest of justice.

37:24.869 --> 37:26.828
- Well, thank you, it'd
serve my family well, sir.

37:26.829 --> 37:29.289
We'd be very, very grateful.

37:29.290 --> 37:30.248
Do you like shrimp?

37:30.249 --> 37:31.082
- Indeed, I do.

37:31.083 --> 37:32.959
- Yeah well, fine, you can
come down to Bay St. Luke,

37:32.960 --> 37:34.669
we'll cook you up a whole mess of shrimp.

37:34.670 --> 37:36.129
We got some shrimp in that family.

37:36.130 --> 37:37.088
Here, have a Tampa.

37:37.089 --> 37:37.923
- Thank you.

37:37.924 --> 37:39.007
- Thelma!

37:39.008 --> 37:40.300
- Bud!

37:40.301 --> 37:42.385
- Come on, honey, we're going home.

37:42.386 --> 37:43.845
- And not a moment, too soon.

37:43.846 --> 37:45.013
- [Judge] Case dismissed.

37:45.014 --> 37:46.973
- I can't tell you the
indignities I suffered here

37:46.974 --> 37:47.807
in this--

37:47.808 --> 37:49.309
- Thank you, Your Honor,
my father thanks you!

37:49.310 --> 37:51.061
- You are entirely welcome.

37:51.062 --> 37:52.604
That girl is colored!

37:52.605 --> 37:54.064
(courtroom gasps)

37:54.065 --> 37:56.191
- Honey, nobody colored
me, I was born this way!

37:56.192 --> 37:57.359
- Now, come here, baby, that's all right!

37:57.360 --> 37:58.193
Bye bye!

37:58.194 --> 37:59.819
Bye bye, see you later!

37:59.820 --> 38:01.780
- Diavolo could have told me
you were the black person...

38:01.781 --> 38:03.949
- Bailiff, I want that man charged

38:03.950 --> 38:05.575
with impersonating a cracker!

38:05.576 --> 38:06.868
- Yes, sir!

38:06.869 --> 38:08.411
- Cliff, that was just incredible.

38:08.412 --> 38:09.746
I can't believe you did that.

38:09.747 --> 38:11.122
- How did this happen to you?

38:11.123 --> 38:12.958
- I was busted, it's an occupational...

38:12.959 --> 38:16.962
I mean, an occasional hazard, you know?

38:16.963 --> 38:18.588
- Oh, Cliff, I mean...

38:18.589 --> 38:19.464
- Impossible!

38:19.465 --> 38:21.633
It was never agreed, never
mentioned, never discussed.

38:21.634 --> 38:22.467
- Oh, come on.

38:22.468 --> 38:23.551
- Come on, Cliff, Smooth was very clear

38:23.552 --> 38:24.552
about the whole thing.

38:24.553 --> 38:26.137
He said, "I'm gonna be
gone two or three days

38:26.138 --> 38:27.222
and Cliff's in charge."

38:27.223 --> 38:29.099
- Have you even heard of Doctor Detroit?

38:29.100 --> 38:31.184
- You see, Skridlow, this
guy has got to be a big man.

38:31.185 --> 38:32.310
He's got to be cool.

38:32.311 --> 38:33.144
- Right.

38:33.145 --> 38:34.521
- He's a partner like Mom,
but only worse, brother.

38:34.522 --> 38:35.647
- Mom?

38:35.648 --> 38:36.898
Are you saying someone's mother is

38:36.899 --> 38:37.774
involved in all of this?

38:37.775 --> 38:39.651
(door slamming)

38:39.652 --> 38:40.444
- Yes!

38:41.320 --> 38:42.404
(Mom laughing)

38:42.405 --> 38:43.238
- Oh, boy.

38:43.239 --> 38:44.072
Hey, check upstairs.

38:44.073 --> 38:44.906
- I like this.

38:44.907 --> 38:45.740
Okay, Mom.

38:45.741 --> 38:47.909
- This is nice, this is real nice.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.661
A gal could be real comfy in here.

38:49.662 --> 38:50.495
- Uh, I...

38:50.496 --> 38:53.164
I don't believe that you're welcome here

38:53.165 --> 38:54.958
and I think that you'd
better leave because--

38:54.959 --> 38:55.751
- Quiet!

38:57.003 --> 38:58.920
Who is this twerp, huh?

38:58.921 --> 39:00.630
Doctor Detroit?

39:00.631 --> 39:01.840
- Well, I wouldn't even venture--

39:01.841 --> 39:03.049
- Don't bother.

39:03.050 --> 39:07.387
Oh, my little stable is
top drawer high quality.

39:07.388 --> 39:10.015
Oh, am I gonna enjoy
running these bitches.

39:10.016 --> 39:11.433
- Hey, we don't work for you.

39:11.434 --> 39:13.059
We never have and we never will.

39:13.060 --> 39:16.563
- Oh, you just sit down!
(exclaiming)

39:16.564 --> 39:17.564
Now, listen!

39:17.565 --> 39:21.985
Smooth's gone, which means
your ass is mine, girlie.

39:21.986 --> 39:24.446
- (stammering) Pardon me
for just a second, now.

39:24.447 --> 39:28.158
I just, just wanna
clarify things here, I...

39:28.159 --> 39:30.201
Now, are you actually saying

39:30.202 --> 39:31.911
that these girls are--

39:31.912 --> 39:33.204
- They're hookers.

39:33.205 --> 39:34.039
(Mom laughing)

39:34.040 --> 39:34.915
And whores.

39:40.254 --> 39:41.087
- Hey!

39:41.088 --> 39:41.921
Hey, I like this.

39:41.922 --> 39:42.756
Take it.

39:42.757 --> 39:44.591
Get this thing here.

39:44.592 --> 39:46.509
Uh, forget that.

39:46.510 --> 39:48.219
Oh, hey, I like this.

39:48.220 --> 39:50.430
Ooh, ain't that a beauty?

39:50.431 --> 39:51.848
Ooh, I like this.

39:51.849 --> 39:52.766
Here!

39:52.767 --> 39:53.600
(glass breaking)

39:53.601 --> 39:54.434
- Hey!

39:54.435 --> 39:55.518
Okay, now, I want you to stop this,

39:55.519 --> 39:56.394
right this instant!

39:56.395 --> 39:57.312
- Let's see what else I can find.

39:57.313 --> 39:58.646
- I mean that!

39:58.647 --> 40:00.690
- Clifford, no, Cliff!

40:00.691 --> 40:02.317
- You'll stop!

40:02.318 --> 40:05.070
You'll take your dirty
mitts off the fixtures.

40:05.071 --> 40:06.696
Those are Doctor's orders.

40:06.697 --> 40:07.739
- Doctor Detroit?

40:07.740 --> 40:10.617
- The bad man from Michigan himself.

40:10.618 --> 40:12.285
I am his executive assistant.

40:12.286 --> 40:14.621
You touch any of us and
his measure of revenge

40:14.622 --> 40:16.623
will be most swift and horrible,

40:16.624 --> 40:18.291
I can assure you of that!

40:18.292 --> 40:21.211
- Damn, Skridlow, talk some shit!

40:21.212 --> 40:23.088
- I'm shivering.

40:23.089 --> 40:23.963
Now, come on, boys.

40:23.964 --> 40:25.006
Finish things up and then you can

40:25.007 --> 40:27.050
bust junior up here for laughs.

40:27.051 --> 40:28.094
- I warn you!

40:29.261 --> 40:30.929
I am extensively read
in White Crane Kung Fu

40:30.930 --> 40:34.058
and Hapkido! (growls)

40:36.102 --> 40:38.311
- Fresh, all right, get down Skridlow.

40:38.312 --> 40:40.980
- Okay, okay, don't get
your balls in an uproar.

40:40.981 --> 40:41.815
We can always talk.

40:41.816 --> 40:42.649
- Well, then talk!

40:42.650 --> 40:43.525
- Oh, not to you.

40:43.526 --> 40:44.526
To the boss.

40:44.527 --> 40:47.320
Me and Doctor Detroit, face to face.

40:47.321 --> 40:49.239
- Ah, you and Doctor Detroit.

40:49.240 --> 40:50.281
Okay, fine.

40:50.282 --> 40:51.282
I'll set up a meeting.

40:51.283 --> 40:52.117
- All right.

40:52.118 --> 40:53.743
- Between you and Doctor Detroit.

40:53.744 --> 40:55.286
Uh, tomorrow night.

40:55.287 --> 40:58.373
At the 126th Street Graveyard at midnight.

40:58.374 --> 40:59.290
- Midnight?

40:59.291 --> 41:00.083
The graveyard? (laughing)

41:00.084 --> 41:00.917
- What is this?

41:00.918 --> 41:02.877
- (laughing) That's
kinda dramatic, ain't it?

41:02.878 --> 41:04.462
- Well, that's my offer.

41:04.463 --> 41:06.297
Take it or leave it.

41:06.298 --> 41:07.549
Bigfoot!

41:07.550 --> 41:09.300
(growling)

41:09.301 --> 41:10.677
- Come on, come on now, cool it, cool it!

41:10.678 --> 41:13.054
- Get down, Skridlow,
with your Hapkido self!

41:13.055 --> 41:13.888
Yeah, brother!

41:13.889 --> 41:15.181
Show 'em what you can do!

41:15.182 --> 41:16.307
- Well, that's it.

41:16.308 --> 41:17.225
That's my offer.

41:17.226 --> 41:20.937
Tomorrow night, 126th
Street graveyard, midnight.

41:20.938 --> 41:23.231
No excuses, no substitutions.

41:23.232 --> 41:24.858
- I don't talk to flunkies.

41:24.859 --> 41:26.025
I'll meet with your Doctor,

41:26.026 --> 41:27.694
we'll settle this shit together.

41:27.695 --> 41:28.653
- Well, then fine.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.029
If our business here is concluded,

41:30.030 --> 41:32.115
I'll kindly ask you to leave.

41:32.116 --> 41:33.741
Leave!

41:33.742 --> 41:34.576
- Okay.

41:34.577 --> 41:35.410
- Get out!

41:35.411 --> 41:36.244
- Tomorrow!

41:36.245 --> 41:37.078
- Get out of here, all of you!

41:37.079 --> 41:37.912
- Come on, boys, let's get out.

41:37.913 --> 41:39.914
- Out with your Raus!

41:39.915 --> 41:40.748
(slaps)

41:40.749 --> 41:41.583
Out!

41:41.584 --> 41:42.417
Scat!

41:42.418 --> 41:43.251
Begone!

41:43.252 --> 41:44.544
Raus!

41:44.545 --> 41:45.545
And don't let the door hit you in your

41:45.546 --> 41:46.588
collective asses on the way out!

41:46.589 --> 41:47.589
(door slams)

41:47.590 --> 41:48.590
- All right, Skridlow!

41:48.591 --> 41:51.009
Get out, man, that Hapkido
shit came in handy, brother.

41:51.010 --> 41:51.885
Right on!

41:51.886 --> 41:53.344
- Cliff, you were
wonderful, you were a hero!

41:53.345 --> 41:54.637
- Our knight in shining armor!

41:54.638 --> 41:55.722
- So macho!

41:55.723 --> 41:56.931
- Mm-hmm.

41:56.932 --> 41:57.807
- You really think so?

41:57.808 --> 41:59.726
- Oh, are you kidding?
- Yeah!

41:59.727 --> 42:01.936
- Look, but what were they saying earlier

42:01.937 --> 42:02.770
about you girls?

42:02.771 --> 42:03.771
I mean, could it possibly be--

42:03.772 --> 42:05.565
- Ah, come on, Cliff, you're a big boy.

42:05.566 --> 42:07.400
It's a job, we're working girls.

42:07.401 --> 42:10.987
And believe me, honey, we are the best.

42:10.988 --> 42:13.364
- You're professionals.

42:13.365 --> 42:17.828
And Smooth was your p... (stuttering)

42:19.163 --> 42:21.498
- Does that change anything, Cliff?

42:21.499 --> 42:23.041
- All right, don't tell me any more.

42:23.042 --> 42:24.000
I will be your protector,

42:24.001 --> 42:25.585
but I won't be your manager, your agent,

42:25.586 --> 42:27.795
nor your p... (stuttering)

42:27.796 --> 42:29.214
I can't even say it.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.633
Anyway, it won't be me,
it'll be Doctor Detroit.

42:31.634 --> 42:33.092
Now, for now we just maintain.

42:33.093 --> 42:35.929
We go on as before until Smooth returns.

42:35.930 --> 42:37.931
The Doctor will take care of everything.

42:37.932 --> 42:40.808
But above all, don't tell
anybody about Doctor Detroit,

42:40.809 --> 42:41.851
nor what I'm doing.

42:41.852 --> 42:42.810
Nobody.

42:42.811 --> 42:44.020
- No problem.
- Trust me, baby.

42:44.021 --> 42:45.647
- Absolutely.

42:45.648 --> 42:48.358
- This Doctor Detroit is bad, B-A-D, man.

42:48.359 --> 42:51.653
He's badder than Larry Holmes,
he's badder than Joe Frazier,

42:51.654 --> 42:54.155
badder than Ken Norton,
badder than Jerry Quarry.

42:54.156 --> 42:55.823
He's even badder than Mr. Clean!

42:55.824 --> 42:56.908
- Mom, Mom!

42:56.909 --> 42:58.034
It's all over the street!

42:58.035 --> 42:58.868
- What?

42:58.869 --> 42:59.994
- Doctor Detroit's moving in.

42:59.995 --> 43:01.162
They say we're moving out.

43:01.163 --> 43:02.121
- Oh, the hell you say.

43:02.122 --> 43:03.665
I haven't even met the Doctor.

43:03.666 --> 43:04.791
(sipping)

43:04.792 --> 43:05.750
But when I do...

43:05.751 --> 43:07.502
(crushing glass)

43:07.503 --> 43:08.629
He's dog meat!

43:10.756 --> 43:13.591
- I must do the decent thing.

43:13.592 --> 43:16.553
It's such an indecent profession.

43:16.554 --> 43:18.638
But you enjoyed it, though, didn't you?

43:18.639 --> 43:21.516
Yes, but I didn't have to pay.

43:21.517 --> 43:23.935
What about this Doctor Detroit?

43:23.936 --> 43:25.061
What about him?

43:25.062 --> 43:27.313
Somebody has to do the work.

43:27.314 --> 43:28.773
Better him than you.

43:28.774 --> 43:29.732
You?

43:29.733 --> 43:31.150
Me?

43:31.151 --> 43:33.111
(scoffs) Sleep on it.

43:33.112 --> 43:34.279
Yeah.

43:34.280 --> 43:35.739
Okay, sleep on it.

43:37.074 --> 43:39.618
(dreamy music)

43:47.293 --> 43:48.126
- Cliff?

43:48.127 --> 43:49.460
- Oh!
- Shh!

43:49.461 --> 43:51.087
Be quiet.

43:51.088 --> 43:51.880
- Jasmine?

43:53.173 --> 43:54.799
What are you doing here?

43:54.800 --> 43:56.093
This is my room.

43:57.261 --> 43:58.761
Uh, Jasmine, where are you taking me?

43:58.762 --> 43:59.929
I'm still half asleep.

43:59.930 --> 44:00.722
- Quick, quick!

44:00.723 --> 44:02.181
- Are you listening to me?

44:02.182 --> 44:04.143
Are you listening to me?

44:05.060 --> 44:07.562
(funky music)

44:07.563 --> 44:09.981
- Ooh, Ulysses S. Motherfucking Grant!

44:09.982 --> 44:11.482
Welcome to the neighborhood, brother.

44:11.483 --> 44:12.400
Ooh!

44:12.401 --> 44:14.319
Cliff, check out this money, man!

44:14.320 --> 44:15.445
Cash money, bro!

44:15.446 --> 44:16.279
- (stammering) I know, but...

44:16.280 --> 44:18.281
But where did all this money come from?

44:18.282 --> 44:19.616
- The old fashioned way.

44:19.617 --> 44:21.159
We earned it.

44:21.160 --> 44:21.993
- But--
- And Cliffie, there are

44:21.994 --> 44:23.661
other fringe benefits.

44:23.662 --> 44:24.746
For example...

44:24.747 --> 44:25.955
- Oriental baths.

44:25.956 --> 44:27.248
- Swedish massages.

44:27.249 --> 44:28.124
- French lessons.

44:28.125 --> 44:29.917
- I know how to speak--

44:29.918 --> 44:32.837
- Exotic, erotic, juicy adventures.

44:32.838 --> 44:34.297
- It's ridiculous.

44:34.298 --> 44:35.965
I mean, what would men of real virtue do

44:35.966 --> 44:37.300
if they were in my position?

44:37.301 --> 44:38.134
- I'll tell you one thing,

44:38.135 --> 44:39.886
they wouldn't sit around
wearing those pajamas, brother.

44:39.887 --> 44:43.181
(chiming music)

44:43.182 --> 44:44.724
- Here's your hat, Daddy!

44:44.725 --> 44:47.852
I picked it out especially for you.

44:47.853 --> 44:49.312
- I'm dreaming.

44:49.313 --> 44:50.355
- [Men] Wages of sin!

44:50.356 --> 44:51.230
Wages of sin!

44:51.231 --> 44:52.940
Give us the money and let us come in!

44:52.941 --> 44:54.901
Wages of sin, wages of sin!

44:54.902 --> 44:57.195
Give us your money and let us come in!

44:57.196 --> 44:58.488
- Judge not, sonny,

44:58.489 --> 45:00.198
lest ye be judged!

45:00.199 --> 45:03.201
Mark well the wages of sin!

45:03.202 --> 45:05.579
(funk music)

45:08.040 --> 45:08.832
Come home.

45:10.793 --> 45:12.418
- Father, I want...

45:12.419 --> 45:15.838
I want you, your parental guidance!

45:15.839 --> 45:17.549
I need moral support!

45:19.927 --> 45:23.472
Father, can't you do
anything to stop this?

45:25.224 --> 45:26.183
- [Men] Hey!

45:36.944 --> 45:38.319
- Clifford, I heard you had some money.

45:38.320 --> 45:39.904
Give it to the college.

45:39.905 --> 45:41.447
- No more bucks from Uncle Sam.

45:41.448 --> 45:43.032
It's gotta come from someplace.

45:43.033 --> 45:43.950
(exhales)

45:43.951 --> 45:44.784
- It's filthy money!

45:44.785 --> 45:46.828
It's money from depraved sources!

45:46.829 --> 45:48.204
- See what money pleasure brings?

45:48.205 --> 45:49.997
See what pleasure money brings?

45:49.998 --> 45:51.165
- Thanks, my man.

45:51.166 --> 45:53.084
I can see where you're coming from.

45:53.085 --> 45:54.168
She's all yours.

45:54.169 --> 45:55.795
- This is fun!

45:55.796 --> 45:57.714
- My mother's not for sale!

45:57.715 --> 46:00.508
- Oh, but they're all for sale.

46:00.509 --> 46:01.884
All for sale, all for sale...

46:01.885 --> 46:02.802
- Not my mother!

46:02.803 --> 46:05.304
Not for the college, not for any money!

46:05.305 --> 46:06.597
Not for anybody!

46:06.598 --> 46:07.849
Not for anything!

46:07.850 --> 46:09.225
Not my mother!

46:09.226 --> 46:10.351
Mother, stop, wait!

46:10.352 --> 46:11.436
- [All] All for sale, all for sale!

46:11.437 --> 46:12.895
All for sale, all for sale!

46:12.896 --> 46:14.355
- Don't go, Mother!

46:14.356 --> 46:15.189
Stop!

46:15.190 --> 46:16.900
Listen, Mother, stop!

46:18.777 --> 46:21.572
(Cliff screaming)

46:27.327 --> 46:28.161
No!

46:28.162 --> 46:30.956
No, I will not sell my own mother!

46:33.542 --> 46:35.209
- Of course you wouldn't, dear.

46:35.210 --> 46:37.254
But it's a sweet thought.

46:47.306 --> 46:50.933
- (sighs) Anybody care to
comment on the concept of uh...

46:50.934 --> 46:52.226
Death before dishonor?

46:52.227 --> 46:53.020
- Look!

46:53.937 --> 46:54.771
- [Cliff] Comments, anyone?

46:54.772 --> 46:56.148
- She's pregnant!

46:57.357 --> 46:58.191
- No?

46:58.192 --> 46:59.942
Good. (slams head)

46:59.943 --> 47:01.444
(bell ringing)
- [Student] Come on, let's go.

47:01.445 --> 47:03.946
(students chattering)

47:03.947 --> 47:07.200
- [Student] All right, see ya!

47:07.201 --> 47:09.452
- Ah, I need to get some sleep.

47:09.453 --> 47:13.456
Edison used to nap in
his lab for two hours.

47:13.457 --> 47:16.584
Napoleon fought a war on four.

47:16.585 --> 47:20.505
Greater men than me have had less sleep.

47:20.506 --> 47:21.298
Oh...

47:23.634 --> 47:24.467
- [Mr. Skirlow] Son?

47:24.468 --> 47:25.843
- Oh!

47:25.844 --> 47:28.304
- Oh, son, I'm glad you
stopped by before leaving.

47:28.305 --> 47:29.138
- Leaving?

47:29.139 --> 47:30.473
- Yeah, well you're going into the city.

47:30.474 --> 47:33.184
Harmon Rousehorn's train
is arriving at 11:00

47:33.185 --> 47:35.436
and you have to arrange for the caterers

47:35.437 --> 47:37.104
for the welcome dinner here tomorrow night

47:37.105 --> 47:40.191
and you have to pick
him up at the station.

47:40.192 --> 47:42.109
Here, uh, take the Buick.

47:42.110 --> 47:43.569
And uh...

47:43.570 --> 47:45.196
Get yourself together.

47:45.197 --> 47:46.406
You're a sight.

47:54.581 --> 47:56.749
- Rousehorn, train.

47:56.750 --> 47:58.167
Edison, nap.

47:58.168 --> 47:59.001
Two hours.

47:59.002 --> 48:00.336
- Yo, Skridlow, what's happening, man?

48:00.337 --> 48:01.170
- Uh...

48:01.171 --> 48:02.630
- Hey, where you going, man?

48:02.631 --> 48:03.881
- Talk, Khyber's.

48:03.882 --> 48:06.300
Union Station, train.

48:06.301 --> 48:07.635
Rousehorn.

48:07.636 --> 48:08.469
Sleep.

48:08.470 --> 48:09.512
- What are you talking about, man?

48:09.513 --> 48:10.596
No, wait, man, you've got
a meeting with Mom tonight

48:10.597 --> 48:12.598
at some graveyard, remember?

48:12.599 --> 48:15.601
You made this date so you got to keep it.

48:15.602 --> 48:18.062
Where's Doctor Detroit, man?

48:18.063 --> 48:19.689
Where's Doctor Detroit?

48:19.690 --> 48:20.523
- Doctor Detroit?

48:20.524 --> 48:21.524
- Yeah.

48:21.525 --> 48:22.901
- Doctor Detroit!

48:23.861 --> 48:26.572
(dramatic music)

48:27.698 --> 48:30.950
I'll make this phone call,
I'll take care of everything.

48:30.951 --> 48:31.743
- Cool.

48:34.204 --> 48:37.123
(dial tones beeping)

48:37.124 --> 48:37.957
- Information.

48:37.958 --> 48:38.791
What city, please?

48:38.792 --> 48:40.626
- Yes, for the city of Chicago.

48:40.627 --> 48:43.713
Number of Mom's Limousine Service.

48:43.714 --> 48:44.506
Thank you.

48:51.263 --> 48:53.724
Yes, I'd like to speak to Mom.

48:54.683 --> 48:55.516
- [Mom] Hello.

48:55.517 --> 48:58.185
Yeah, yeah, this is Mom speaking.

48:58.186 --> 48:59.604
- (faking rasp) Ah...

48:59.605 --> 49:00.397
Uh...

49:02.608 --> 49:03.901
Hey, hello, Mom?

49:05.694 --> 49:08.321
Uh, this is the Doctor.

49:08.322 --> 49:09.531
Doctor Detroit.

49:10.741 --> 49:13.659
Yeah, I'm sorry about the static.

49:13.660 --> 49:17.538
I'm on the mobile phone
in my car right now

49:17.539 --> 49:20.374
and I'm on my way down I-94.

49:20.375 --> 49:22.501
Yes, I came all the way down from Detroit

49:22.502 --> 49:24.670
and I'm not very happy about it!

49:24.671 --> 49:25.713
Now, look, Mom.

49:25.714 --> 49:29.091
About our little meeting
tonight at midnight, I...

49:29.092 --> 49:30.552
It's not midnight.

49:31.553 --> 49:32.386
No.

49:32.387 --> 49:37.351
I know he said that, but I
can't make it at midnight.

49:37.559 --> 49:39.226
Of course it's short notice.

49:39.227 --> 49:40.478
Now, you look!

49:40.479 --> 49:42.146
I mean, look here...

49:42.147 --> 49:46.067
It's your little pink plump
rump in the ringer, not mine.

49:46.068 --> 49:47.818
So you make it nine o'clock or not.

49:47.819 --> 49:49.070
- [Mom] Just bite it, buster!

49:49.071 --> 49:52.073
- Yeah, well, you bite it yourself, Mom.

49:52.074 --> 49:53.240
Bye.

49:53.241 --> 49:56.203
(dial tone humming)

50:00.040 --> 50:02.500
- Say, man, how you
gonna get away with this

50:02.501 --> 50:06.629
playing all that, uh, uh, uh, shit, huh?

50:06.630 --> 50:08.547
- Fear not, Sancho.

50:08.548 --> 50:09.757
Say no more.

50:09.758 --> 50:12.218
Let's ask ourselves,
what would El Zorro do

50:12.219 --> 50:13.803
in a situation like this or

50:13.804 --> 50:15.429
Man of La Mancha?

50:15.430 --> 50:17.556
Strategy, purity, bravery.

50:17.557 --> 50:18.975
I am many.

50:18.976 --> 50:20.142
I am one.

50:20.143 --> 50:22.561
- Yeah, you one crazy
individual human being, man.

50:22.562 --> 50:24.146
- Come on!

50:24.147 --> 50:26.858
(dramatic music)

50:40.622 --> 50:41.455
Ooh, ooh, lift me up!

50:41.456 --> 50:42.373
That, I want that!

50:42.374 --> 50:44.333
- What do you want that thing for?

50:44.334 --> 50:47.129
(thrilling music)

51:07.149 --> 51:10.944
- Right, this is the
graveyard we agreed upon.

51:12.029 --> 51:15.323
Um, everybody just, uh, stay in the car.

51:28.211 --> 51:30.463
From inside the jouster's tents,

51:30.464 --> 51:33.966
the sound of the armorers
accomplishing the knights,

51:33.967 --> 51:37.928
busy hammers closing rivets
up give dreadful note

51:37.929 --> 51:39.139
of preparation.

51:41.224 --> 51:43.935
(dramatic music)

52:01.745 --> 52:03.079
- Damn, he won't show.

52:03.080 --> 52:04.914
- Sure he will.

52:04.915 --> 52:08.459
I'll give that son of a bitch
just another five minutes.

52:08.460 --> 52:10.252
- And then what, Mom?

52:10.253 --> 52:12.213
- Well, I'll wait some more.

52:12.214 --> 52:15.050
I've got all night to kill his ass.

52:17.385 --> 52:20.097
(dramatic music)

53:24.452 --> 53:26.453
- (raspy) Uh, all right now.

53:26.454 --> 53:30.584
Which one of you is Mom? (laughs)

53:34.254 --> 53:37.923
Punctuality is a virtue, my good madame.

53:37.924 --> 53:39.884
Let's chew the fat.

53:39.885 --> 53:41.468
- Just what's that supposed to mean?

53:41.469 --> 53:43.512
- Oh, nothing personal, Love Chunks,

53:43.513 --> 53:45.139
but can we get to it?

53:45.140 --> 53:47.725
You know I hate to come
down from Wayne County.

53:47.726 --> 53:49.268
I have businesses in Lansing,

53:49.269 --> 53:51.061
I have muffler shops, chicken chains.

53:51.062 --> 53:52.688
I got slums to collect the rent from.

53:52.689 --> 53:54.940
I have a chiropractic practice.

53:54.941 --> 53:56.692
I make adjustments
(snap)

53:56.693 --> 53:58.527
to the human spine.

53:58.528 --> 54:00.696
And this little trip has cut far too much

54:00.697 --> 54:03.574
into my professional time.

54:03.575 --> 54:05.659
- I figured that since
you're hustling my turf

54:05.660 --> 54:06.870
we should talk.

54:08.413 --> 54:09.706
I run this town.

54:11.583 --> 54:13.000
- Uh, ah!

54:13.001 --> 54:14.418
Lurking in the dark!

54:14.419 --> 54:15.836
Nasty things!

54:15.837 --> 54:16.837
Come out!

54:16.838 --> 54:18.214
- [Mom] Okay, fellas, come on!

54:18.215 --> 54:19.090
- Come out!

54:23.303 --> 54:25.054
Come on out here, yeah, that's right.

54:25.055 --> 54:28.183
Out here where the Doctor can see you.

54:30.352 --> 54:32.353
- Lighten up, come on,
Skridlow, be cool, man.

54:32.354 --> 54:33.979
Be cool, don't blow it, man.

54:33.980 --> 54:35.731
- You wanna move in on
me without permission,

54:35.732 --> 54:37.233
without consideration?

54:37.234 --> 54:38.776
You gotta pay!

54:38.777 --> 54:40.820
- The Doctor doesn't pay.

54:43.114 --> 54:43.948
- That's it?

54:43.949 --> 54:48.035
- The Doctor doesn't pay
and he doesn't worry.

54:48.036 --> 54:50.371
Now, Mom, if you want trouble,

54:50.372 --> 54:52.665
I am talking about scorched earth!

54:52.666 --> 54:53.749
No survival!

54:53.750 --> 54:55.334
Wholesale destruction!

54:55.335 --> 54:56.168
- Calm down, Cliff.

54:56.169 --> 54:57.628
- Please help me, God, I
wanna live, I wanna live.

54:57.629 --> 54:58.671
Please bless me.
- Oh my God.

54:58.672 --> 55:03.635
- Body bags and fire, trouble,
then you just keep coming on!

55:03.802 --> 55:05.970
- You don't know what
trouble is, jerk-off!

55:05.971 --> 55:09.098
- Mom, I am going to rip off your head

55:09.099 --> 55:11.059
and shit down your neck.

55:15.272 --> 55:16.563
- Kill him!

55:16.564 --> 55:17.398
Kill him!

55:17.399 --> 55:19.859
(guns firing)

55:24.906 --> 55:26.073
Get in the car, get after him!

55:26.074 --> 55:26.907
You go there!

55:26.908 --> 55:29.576
(Diavolo and ladies shouting)

55:29.577 --> 55:32.496
(gun firing)

55:32.497 --> 55:33.330
- Don't shoot!

55:33.331 --> 55:34.957
We were on our way to
Leon's for some ribs, man,

55:34.958 --> 55:35.791
and he was hitchhiking.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.459
We don't even know this
cat, man, he's crazy!

55:37.460 --> 55:38.253
- Whoa!

55:41.965 --> 55:42.798
- Get outta here!

55:42.799 --> 55:43.591
Go on!

55:44.926 --> 55:45.968
- Hey guys!

55:45.969 --> 55:46.761
Hey, stop!

55:49.639 --> 55:51.181
I uh...

55:51.182 --> 55:53.267
Ah, I'm Clifford Skridlow!

55:53.268 --> 55:54.477
I teach school!

55:56.104 --> 55:57.938
I don't even know these girls!

55:57.939 --> 55:59.398
I met them in a restaurant!

55:59.399 --> 56:00.858
I have nothing against you personally!

56:00.859 --> 56:02.276
Jesus, they're serious.

56:02.277 --> 56:03.570
They're serious.

56:04.529 --> 56:06.780
(car crashing)

56:06.781 --> 56:08.073
Oh my god!

56:08.074 --> 56:08.867
Yikes!

56:17.667 --> 56:19.626
(car crashing)

56:19.627 --> 56:20.420
Whoa!

56:21.838 --> 56:24.173
(collapsing)

56:24.174 --> 56:24.966
Yeah!

56:25.884 --> 56:28.428
Nothing can destroy the Doctor!

56:29.512 --> 56:30.346
- Hey, come on!

56:30.347 --> 56:31.764
Get him, get him, get him!

56:31.765 --> 56:34.308
- Out of the way, knave!

56:34.309 --> 56:36.810
(thrilling music)

56:36.811 --> 56:37.728
The battle wages on!

56:37.729 --> 56:38.812
Run for your lives!

56:38.813 --> 56:39.606
Run!

56:41.107 --> 56:43.318
Mom, you'll never catch me!

56:44.402 --> 56:45.319
Never!

56:45.320 --> 56:47.196
Run away, run away!

56:47.197 --> 56:48.030
- Guys, we need those girls.

56:48.031 --> 56:50.574
You need to stop him, come on!

56:50.575 --> 56:53.912
Oh God, what have I done to deserve this?

56:56.873 --> 56:59.834
(car speeding past)

57:10.470 --> 57:12.429
(vehicle reversing)

57:12.430 --> 57:13.263
What the hell?

57:13.264 --> 57:14.098
What the...

57:14.099 --> 57:15.391
Hey, what the hell you doing?

57:15.392 --> 57:17.352
- I've got you now, Mom!

57:18.895 --> 57:19.728
- What the hell's...

57:19.729 --> 57:22.272
- Going up, Love Chunks!

57:22.273 --> 57:23.190
- Come on!

57:23.191 --> 57:25.984
- Oh yes, this one's on the Doctor.

57:25.985 --> 57:27.569
- I'm gonna get you, I'm gonna get you!

57:27.570 --> 57:28.404
(Cliff laughing)

57:28.405 --> 57:29.238
- Where are we going?

57:29.239 --> 57:30.072
- I hope it doesn't pinch.

57:30.073 --> 57:30.906
- Wait, no, come on!

57:30.907 --> 57:31.740
This isn't funny!

57:31.741 --> 57:32.574
- Shut up, I don't wanna hear you anymore.

57:32.575 --> 57:33.742
- [Mom] We can make deal!

57:33.743 --> 57:34.868
Let's make a deal!

57:34.869 --> 57:35.702
Come on, now!

57:35.703 --> 57:36.537
- Mom!

57:36.538 --> 57:37.663
- Let me down!

57:37.664 --> 57:39.415
- Goodnight, Mom.

57:39.416 --> 57:41.375
- [Mom] This minute!

57:41.376 --> 57:44.336
(Mom shouts and crashes)

57:44.337 --> 57:46.839
(triumphant music)

57:46.840 --> 57:48.132
- Cliff!
- Come on!

57:48.133 --> 57:49.342
Come on, quick!

57:54.389 --> 57:55.305
- Drive!

57:55.306 --> 57:56.598
Drive!

57:56.599 --> 57:58.976
Nothing can stop us!

57:58.977 --> 58:00.561
- This'll stop 'em!

58:00.562 --> 58:01.812
- Charge!

58:01.813 --> 58:03.564
Onward through the gates!

58:03.565 --> 58:05.524
(ladies screaming)

58:05.525 --> 58:07.735
(crashing)

58:09.779 --> 58:12.657
(triumphant music)

58:21.499 --> 58:23.460
Onward to Union Station!

58:24.586 --> 58:27.297
(all exclaiming)

58:28.923 --> 58:31.925
- [Station Announcer] Arriving at Track 14

58:31.926 --> 58:33.094
from St. Louis.

58:50.820 --> 58:52.321
- Well, he's got to be there, Harmon.

58:52.322 --> 58:53.614
He left here hours ago.

58:53.615 --> 58:54.990
- What's the matter, dear?

58:54.991 --> 58:57.201
- Cliff is late and Rousehorn's pissed.

58:57.202 --> 58:58.785
You're, uh, you're missed, Harmon.

58:58.786 --> 59:00.913
I said that we miss you very much.

59:00.914 --> 59:01.872
(Mrs. Skridlow laughs)

59:01.873 --> 59:03.749
- Arthur, take it easy.

59:03.750 --> 59:05.250
I'll be there.

59:05.251 --> 59:07.586
- Mister, you want a taxi?

59:07.587 --> 59:09.129
- Are you a taxi?

59:09.130 --> 59:10.255
- No, jerk-off, I'm a person,

59:10.256 --> 59:11.507
but I do drive a taxi.

59:11.508 --> 59:12.424
It's right outside.

59:12.425 --> 59:14.009
- Can you take me to Monroe College?

59:14.010 --> 59:14.843
- Sure thing.

59:14.844 --> 59:16.512
Hey, TJ, I got a customer.

59:16.513 --> 59:17.555
- I'm coming!

59:23.186 --> 59:24.479
- Mr. Rousehorn!

59:27.982 --> 59:29.775
Mr. Rousehorn!

59:29.776 --> 59:30.943
- [Thelma] Is there a
Rousehorn in the house?

59:30.944 --> 59:32.237
- Mr. Rousehorn!

59:34.697 --> 59:36.823
- Okay, let's try again now.

59:36.824 --> 59:39.117
For the 200th time,

59:39.118 --> 59:41.328
you got to the train station and?

59:41.329 --> 59:43.622
- And he wasn't there,
I looked everywhere.

59:43.623 --> 59:44.790
- Well, then where is he?

59:44.791 --> 59:47.084
And where is the endowment
check for the college?

59:47.085 --> 59:48.377
- Father, I haven't the foggiest idea.

59:48.378 --> 59:49.461
I really don't know.

59:49.462 --> 59:51.213
- Boys, you've been
through this all morning.

59:51.214 --> 59:52.631
Now, darling, have some breakfast.

59:52.632 --> 59:54.967
- No, no, no, not until I
know that Rousehorn is safe

59:54.968 --> 59:56.301
and that check is safe with him.

59:56.302 --> 59:57.970
Margaret, I feel that
you don't understand.

59:57.971 --> 01:00:00.222
We have no cash flow.

01:00:00.223 --> 01:00:01.431
Without that check, we are over,

01:00:01.432 --> 01:00:02.766
through, finished, forget it.

01:00:02.767 --> 01:00:04.768
- Eighty-sixed, no more,
history, color it gone.

01:00:04.769 --> 01:00:05.602
- Don't help.

01:00:05.603 --> 01:00:06.436
Oh, don't...

01:00:06.437 --> 01:00:07.271
Don't you help.

01:00:07.272 --> 01:00:08.105
(vehicle approaching)

01:00:08.106 --> 01:00:09.189
Oh my God, no.

01:00:09.190 --> 01:00:10.566
What is it?

01:00:10.567 --> 01:00:11.692
Well, it's the police.

01:00:11.693 --> 01:00:12.902
See, he's dead.

01:00:14.445 --> 01:00:15.654
Oh, I hope they found the check.

01:00:15.655 --> 01:00:16.572
- Oh, it's all right, darling.

01:00:16.573 --> 01:00:17.864
Everything's going to be fine.

01:00:17.865 --> 01:00:18.908
Come on, now.

01:00:25.248 --> 01:00:26.373
- Harmon?

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:28.709
My heavens, what happened?

01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:30.586
Well, thank God you're safe!

01:00:30.587 --> 01:00:32.087
- He said he was on his way here,

01:00:32.088 --> 01:00:33.714
so this is where we brought him.

01:00:33.715 --> 01:00:35.507
- Oh, you need some hot tea.

01:00:35.508 --> 01:00:36.842
- I kept the case.

01:00:36.843 --> 01:00:37.759
The check is safe.

01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:38.594
- Ah!

01:00:38.595 --> 01:00:39.428
- I need a shower.

01:00:39.429 --> 01:00:40.262
- Oh, I'm sorry, sir,

01:00:40.263 --> 01:00:41.221
but I've got to have that blanket back.

01:00:41.222 --> 01:00:43.390
That's a city blanket, I signed for it.

01:00:43.391 --> 01:00:46.768
- Well, listen, there's no
need to linger out here.

01:00:46.769 --> 01:00:50.272
Uh, welcome to Monroe,
you're in the guest room.

01:00:50.273 --> 01:00:52.566
- All I know is I need a shower.

01:00:52.567 --> 01:00:54.443
- Well, you're certainly dressed for one.

01:00:54.444 --> 01:00:55.986
Now, tell me all about it.

01:00:55.987 --> 01:00:57.529
How did they get your pants off?

01:00:57.530 --> 01:00:59.114
- One leg at a time.

01:00:59.115 --> 01:00:59.948
- Of course.

01:00:59.949 --> 01:01:01.617
Did they molest you, did you struggle?

01:01:01.618 --> 01:01:03.827
I want all the details.

01:01:03.828 --> 01:01:06.788
- Only a benevolent deity
could have prevented him

01:01:06.789 --> 01:01:08.582
from losing that check.

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:11.418
Now, after dinner he is
gonna feel so much better.

01:01:11.419 --> 01:01:13.128
What time are the caterers coming here?

01:01:13.129 --> 01:01:14.129
- Caterer.

01:01:14.130 --> 01:01:15.005
- The caterers.

01:01:15.006 --> 01:01:16.089
For the welcome dinner.

01:01:16.090 --> 01:01:18.592
Here, tonight, Rousehorn,
half the faculty.

01:01:18.593 --> 01:01:19.926
Indian food, the Khyber restaurant.

01:01:19.927 --> 01:01:20.761
Don't you dare tell me
that you neglected--

01:01:20.762 --> 01:01:21.595
- Oh, no!

01:01:21.596 --> 01:01:23.055
No, no, no, no, everything's
totally under control, Dad!

01:01:23.056 --> 01:01:25.057
Everything's totally and
absolutely under control, uh,

01:01:25.058 --> 01:01:28.727
catering, the chapatis, papadums, raita...

01:01:28.728 --> 01:01:29.561
- Ah!

01:01:29.562 --> 01:01:31.438
- Ha, got the curry, not to worry.

01:01:31.439 --> 01:01:32.231
Bye!

01:01:35.193 --> 01:01:36.735
Look out, gentleman, please!

01:01:36.736 --> 01:01:39.571
Excuse me, coming through here!

01:01:39.572 --> 01:01:41.156
Gangway!

01:01:41.157 --> 01:01:42.949
Coming through, coming through!

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:44.327
Please, look out!

01:01:45.495 --> 01:01:46.870
- Cliff, what is it?

01:01:46.871 --> 01:01:47.746
- Catering!

01:01:47.747 --> 01:01:49.122
The Khyber restaurant.

01:01:49.123 --> 01:01:50.082
I did not do it.

01:01:50.083 --> 01:01:51.625
I had to do it and I didn't do it

01:01:51.626 --> 01:01:53.835
in the seconds and minutes
and hours, it's not done!

01:01:53.836 --> 01:01:54.670
- All right, now just wait a minute,

01:01:54.671 --> 01:01:57.714
now, look, just relax, okay?

01:01:57.715 --> 01:01:59.007
Now, what is the problem?

01:01:59.008 --> 01:02:02.386
- I lost Rousehorn, I've got
these term papers to correct.

01:02:02.387 --> 01:02:05.138
The college is on the verge of bankruptcy.

01:02:05.139 --> 01:02:06.431
My eyes can't focus,

01:02:06.432 --> 01:02:08.016
my tongue tastes like a skidmark,

01:02:08.017 --> 01:02:08.975
I need some sleep.

01:02:08.976 --> 01:02:09.893
- Okay, all right.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:11.353
So you sleep, okay?

01:02:11.354 --> 01:02:13.313
Edison survived on two
hours of sleep a night.

01:02:13.314 --> 01:02:14.981
He took catnaps in his lab.

01:02:14.982 --> 01:02:17.025
- That's right.

01:02:17.026 --> 01:02:18.527
- All right.

01:02:18.528 --> 01:02:20.904
Uh, catnaps, Edison.

01:02:20.905 --> 01:02:23.365
Two hours I'm gonna...

01:02:23.366 --> 01:02:24.783
I'm gonna sleep.

01:02:24.784 --> 01:02:26.410
This is good.

01:02:26.411 --> 01:02:27.203
Sleep.

01:02:28.871 --> 01:02:30.288
- What do you think I should
do about these papers?

01:02:30.289 --> 01:02:31.123
- Give them all a B.

01:02:31.124 --> 01:02:33.625
That's all they deserve anyway.

01:02:33.626 --> 01:02:34.459
- [Karen] Yello?

01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:35.502
- Hello, Karen?

01:02:35.503 --> 01:02:37.629
- Hi, Monica, what's up?

01:02:37.630 --> 01:02:38.630
What?

01:02:38.631 --> 01:02:39.631
He needs catering?

01:02:39.632 --> 01:02:40.799
Arrangements?

01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:42.968
Honey, catering is my middle name!

01:02:42.969 --> 01:02:44.928
Karen "Catering" Blittstein.

01:02:44.929 --> 01:02:46.346
Sure.

01:02:46.347 --> 01:02:49.725
I put two sisters through
gorgeous, gorgeous weddings

01:02:49.726 --> 01:02:51.309
and I'm not talking no cocktail franks

01:02:51.310 --> 01:02:53.019
and miniature knishes, neither.

01:02:53.020 --> 01:02:54.230
- Karen, shush!

01:02:55.273 --> 01:02:57.357
Will you just take care of it?

01:02:57.358 --> 01:02:58.442
- I'll get there as soon as I can.

01:02:58.443 --> 01:03:00.152
Okay, bye, I love you.

01:03:00.153 --> 01:03:01.027
Shit.

01:03:01.028 --> 01:03:01.862
- What?

01:03:01.863 --> 01:03:02.696
- I don't have time to cook!

01:03:02.697 --> 01:03:05.825
I'm gonna have to improvise something.

01:03:07.160 --> 01:03:08.744
(classical piano music)

01:03:08.745 --> 01:03:10.704
- This is refreshing medication.

01:03:10.705 --> 01:03:14.666
- (laughs) Now, then,
that Harold Robbins Chair.

01:03:14.667 --> 01:03:17.085
It's quite an endowment, huh?

01:03:17.086 --> 01:03:20.380
- More than a penny and
less than the national debt.

01:03:20.381 --> 01:03:21.214
(laughing)

01:03:21.215 --> 01:03:23.717
- Now then, like what
amount are we talking...

01:03:23.718 --> 01:03:25.677
I mean, I don't mean
for you to be specific,

01:03:25.678 --> 01:03:26.845
I mean just generally, you know,

01:03:26.846 --> 01:03:27.679
in round numbers.

01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:29.055
What amount are we talking about?

01:03:29.056 --> 01:03:29.890
Just about...

01:03:29.891 --> 01:03:32.017
- For that, Arthur, you'll
have to wait until tomorrow.

01:03:32.018 --> 01:03:32.851
- Ah.

01:03:32.852 --> 01:03:34.186
- I want to treasure the
look on everyone's face

01:03:34.187 --> 01:03:36.730
when our corporate
generosity is made public.

01:03:36.731 --> 01:03:40.025
- Absolutely, I couldn't agree more.

01:03:40.026 --> 01:03:41.610
(telephone rings)

01:03:41.611 --> 01:03:42.819
- Help!

01:03:42.820 --> 01:03:44.029
Help!

01:03:44.030 --> 01:03:45.614
Oh, I'm buried alive!

01:03:45.615 --> 01:03:47.032
(telephone rings)

01:03:47.033 --> 01:03:48.242
Oh, let me out!

01:03:56.626 --> 01:03:57.459
Hello.

01:03:57.460 --> 01:03:58.293
- [Karen] Cliff, where are you?

01:03:58.294 --> 01:03:59.127
It's 7:30!

01:03:59.128 --> 01:03:59.961
- What?

01:03:59.962 --> 01:04:00.796
What time is it?
- [Karen] 7:30!

01:04:00.797 --> 01:04:01.630
- It is?

01:04:01.631 --> 01:04:02.464
- [Karen] Yes!

01:04:02.465 --> 01:04:03.298
- Oh, I'm coming.

01:04:03.299 --> 01:04:04.132
- [Karen] Hurry up, get over here!

01:04:04.133 --> 01:04:06.134
- I'll be right there, I'm gone!

01:04:06.135 --> 01:04:09.096
(guests chattering)

01:04:10.598 --> 01:04:11.431
- [Mr. Skridlow] Son!

01:04:11.432 --> 01:04:12.933
Uh, son, before you change your clothes.

01:04:12.934 --> 01:04:14.601
- Ah, Skridlow.

01:04:14.602 --> 01:04:16.102
- Hello, Fulsom, how are you?

01:04:16.103 --> 01:04:17.687
- That boy just work,
work, work, won't you,

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.564
Harmon, you don't know
my son, Clifford, do you?

01:04:19.565 --> 01:04:22.776
He's one of the bright stars
of our English department.

01:04:22.777 --> 01:04:23.610
- Oh, we've met.

01:04:23.611 --> 01:04:25.028
Not on time, but we've met.

01:04:25.029 --> 01:04:26.154
- Oh! (laughs)

01:04:26.155 --> 01:04:27.030
- This morning, Father, remember?

01:04:27.031 --> 01:04:29.032
Uh, I'm so sorry about last night, Harmon,

01:04:29.033 --> 01:04:31.076
er, Mr. Rousehorn, about
missing your train, I--

01:04:31.077 --> 01:04:32.077
- It's in the past.

01:04:32.078 --> 01:04:34.120
- It is totally forgotten and forgiven.

01:04:34.121 --> 01:04:35.330
- Let's just say it's in the past.

01:04:35.331 --> 01:04:39.501
- Oh, I just know this is
gonna be a lively evening!

01:04:39.502 --> 01:04:43.380
Oh, Clifford, those girls are wonderful.

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:46.007
You certainly have
everything under control.

01:04:46.008 --> 01:04:47.509
- Girls?

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:48.885
- I think I'll take the red caviar

01:04:48.886 --> 01:04:49.803
and put it on the round cracker.

01:04:49.804 --> 01:04:51.054
You think they'll like that, honey?

01:04:51.055 --> 01:04:52.222
- (stammering) What's going on here?

01:04:52.223 --> 01:04:53.181
What is this?

01:04:53.182 --> 01:04:54.099
I mean, do you have any idea

01:04:54.100 --> 01:04:56.893
how college faculty members
eat on what we get paid?

01:04:56.894 --> 01:04:59.020
A free meal is like honey
to a bear to these people!

01:04:59.021 --> 01:05:01.356
They're going to want to
eat enough to hibernate on.

01:05:01.357 --> 01:05:02.566
They're animals!

01:05:02.567 --> 01:05:04.067
I mean, where are we gonna
get enough Indian food

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:05.527
to feed all of 'em?

01:05:05.528 --> 01:05:07.946
- Swami Diavolo's finger-lickin'
Hindu fried chicken,

01:05:07.947 --> 01:05:08.905
my friend Skridlow.

01:05:08.906 --> 01:05:10.991
- The rest, as my people
say, is up to karma.

01:05:10.992 --> 01:05:12.534
Don't worry, Cliffie.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:14.536
- Jesus Christ, Karen,
you said this was curry.

01:05:14.537 --> 01:05:15.370
This is not curry--

01:05:15.371 --> 01:05:16.204
- Thelma, it will be.

01:05:16.205 --> 01:05:17.455
Will you calm down?

01:05:17.456 --> 01:05:18.290
- Okay.

01:05:18.291 --> 01:05:19.666
- Cliff, go upstairs and shower and change

01:05:19.667 --> 01:05:21.626
and put something on that's nice.

01:05:21.627 --> 01:05:23.295
Look a little GQ, would you?

01:05:23.296 --> 01:05:25.338
Monica, go outside and
schmooze with the people.

01:05:25.339 --> 01:05:26.256
- Right, Sarge.

01:05:26.257 --> 01:05:28.174
- Okay, Thelma, come here
now, I'm gonna show you.

01:05:28.175 --> 01:05:31.261
Take the olive and the pimento,
make happy faces, okay?

01:05:31.262 --> 01:05:32.095
- I like that.

01:05:32.096 --> 01:05:33.847
- Good, okay, here we go.

01:05:33.848 --> 01:05:35.974
- Well, of course, that
was in the Herbert Hoover

01:05:35.975 --> 01:05:38.935
administration, which
in some ways is similar

01:05:38.936 --> 01:05:40.478
to what we have today!

01:05:40.479 --> 01:05:42.772
- Oh, Margaret, I fail to
see any similarity at all--

01:05:42.773 --> 01:05:43.982
- She's just kidding, Henry.

01:05:43.983 --> 01:05:45.650
She's a real kidder.

01:05:45.651 --> 01:05:47.110
- And I was reduced to my underwear.

01:05:47.111 --> 01:05:49.029
It's been downhill ever since.

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:51.197
- Oh, my goodness.

01:05:51.198 --> 01:05:53.742
You know, you look very
tired, Mr. Rousehorn.

01:05:53.743 --> 01:05:55.493
You know, wealth and power have a way

01:05:55.494 --> 01:05:58.830
of robbing a man of his
energies, don't they?

01:05:58.831 --> 01:06:02.792
- That's very perceptive of you, Monica.

01:06:02.793 --> 01:06:04.252
Very perceptive.

01:06:04.253 --> 01:06:05.921
- I hear we're having Indian food.

01:06:05.922 --> 01:06:08.006
- I certainly hope so.

01:06:08.007 --> 01:06:09.174
- Chapatis, huh?

01:06:09.175 --> 01:06:10.133
- Well, I...

01:06:10.134 --> 01:06:12.135
I guess they've got a
few of those laid in, I--

01:06:12.136 --> 01:06:13.720
- Hello, won't you excuse us, please?

01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:14.804
You happy, gorgeous boy?

01:06:14.805 --> 01:06:16.222
We're having some nice affair here.

01:06:16.223 --> 01:06:17.432
Hi, how are you?

01:06:17.433 --> 01:06:18.475
Nice to see you.

01:06:18.476 --> 01:06:19.309
- It seems fine,

01:06:19.310 --> 01:06:20.352
but I'm really worried
about the meal, Karen, I--

01:06:20.353 --> 01:06:22.145
- Wait till you see the entertainment.

01:06:22.146 --> 01:06:22.979
- What?

01:06:22.980 --> 01:06:24.105
- Jasmine!
(boombox clicks)

01:06:24.106 --> 01:06:25.732
Enter!

01:06:25.733 --> 01:06:29.278
(Indian pop music playing)

01:06:34.617 --> 01:06:35.576
- Hi, Cliff!

01:06:37.161 --> 01:06:39.372
(clapping)

01:06:52.385 --> 01:06:53.177
- Oh, my!

01:06:54.553 --> 01:06:56.096
- Ooh.

01:06:56.097 --> 01:06:59.516
(crowd laughing)

01:06:59.517 --> 01:07:01.434
- Uh, she's, she's uh...

01:07:01.435 --> 01:07:02.352
- She's terrific.

01:07:02.353 --> 01:07:03.145
Come on.

01:07:05.439 --> 01:07:06.982
Oh, you're ready!

01:07:06.983 --> 01:07:07.774
- I'm ready.

01:07:07.775 --> 01:07:09.943
- Okay, you set?

01:07:09.944 --> 01:07:10.777
- We're set.

01:07:10.778 --> 01:07:12.278
- All right, fire!

01:07:12.279 --> 01:07:13.321
- Be careful, now.

01:07:13.322 --> 01:07:14.489
Too much!

01:07:14.490 --> 01:07:15.407
There's a fire!

01:07:15.408 --> 01:07:16.783
Fire, don't panic!

01:07:16.784 --> 01:07:17.617
- What are you doing?

01:07:17.618 --> 01:07:18.451
Stop it!

01:07:18.452 --> 01:07:19.285
(spraying)

01:07:19.286 --> 01:07:20.412
- Skridlow, what are you doing, man?

01:07:20.413 --> 01:07:22.497
- Stop this, please, Cliff!

01:07:22.498 --> 01:07:25.250
Leave the arrangements to me, would you?

01:07:25.251 --> 01:07:27.168
- Oh, this shit is so unique,
they're gonna love it!

01:07:27.169 --> 01:07:29.170
They're gonna love this shit, I know it!

01:07:29.171 --> 01:07:30.005
- Oh!

01:07:30.006 --> 01:07:30.839
(Thelma coughing)

01:07:30.840 --> 01:07:31.673
- I panicked, I'm sorry, I panicked.

01:07:31.674 --> 01:07:33.800
- It's okay, it's okay, just
none of us eat it, all right?

01:07:33.801 --> 01:07:34.592
(Thelma coughs)

01:07:34.593 --> 01:07:37.555
(guests applauding)

01:07:41.017 --> 01:07:43.144
(chiming)

01:07:46.355 --> 01:07:49.024
- Your dinner is now served.

01:07:49.025 --> 01:07:50.734
- Come on, everybody!

01:07:50.735 --> 01:07:53.696
(guests chattering)

01:07:59.869 --> 01:08:01.578
- Mm, not bad!

01:08:01.579 --> 01:08:03.163
- Beats fruit cup.

01:08:03.164 --> 01:08:04.706
- Isn't it marvelous having so many

01:08:04.707 --> 01:08:07.751
educated palates all in one place?

01:08:07.752 --> 01:08:08.585
- Is she Indian?

01:08:08.586 --> 01:08:09.627
- I think so.

01:08:09.628 --> 01:08:12.047
- Mahatma Gandhi never had it so good.

01:08:12.048 --> 01:08:12.881
- Truly.

01:08:12.882 --> 01:08:15.133
'Course, he wasn't that
big an eater anyway.

01:08:15.134 --> 01:08:18.178
- (laughs) That's funny.

01:08:18.179 --> 01:08:20.138
- Ooh, sahib, follow me, brother.

01:08:20.139 --> 01:08:24.185
(gibberish) Muhammad Ali, Allah.

01:08:25.728 --> 01:08:26.644
- This is great.

01:08:26.645 --> 01:08:28.063
This is tremendous, they're buying it!

01:08:28.064 --> 01:08:28.897
You pulled it off.

01:08:28.898 --> 01:08:29.939
I can't thank you enough.

01:08:29.939 --> 01:08:30.939
- Hey, no problem, Skridlow,

01:08:30.941 --> 01:08:32.734
but thank me in the car, okay, man?

01:08:32.734 --> 01:08:33.734
- What do you mean in the car?

01:08:33.736 --> 01:08:35.153
- Well, we have to go into town now, man.

01:08:35.154 --> 01:08:35.987
- What?

01:08:35.988 --> 01:08:36.904
Not me, I'm not going anywhere.

01:08:36.906 --> 01:08:38.281
I haven't slept in days, Diavolo.

01:08:38.282 --> 01:08:40.658
- Hey, listen, Cliff, we
don't have much time, okay?

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:42.202
The word is on the street.

01:08:42.203 --> 01:08:43.703
You have to make an appearance.

01:08:43.703 --> 01:08:46.790
'Cause the Doctor goes
public in about one hour.

01:08:46.791 --> 01:08:47.999
- Are you crazy?

01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.417
- No, man, you're crazy.

01:08:49.417 --> 01:08:51.502
You invented the dude, not me.

01:08:51.504 --> 01:08:55.299
So I guess I'll catch
you in the car, brother.

01:09:02.223 --> 01:09:03.180
- Oh, come on.

01:09:03.182 --> 01:09:06.392
Everyone's talking about
how you stopped Mom.

01:09:06.393 --> 01:09:08.812
Doctor Detroit has to
be on the scene, right?

01:09:08.813 --> 01:09:09.895
- He has to.
- Right.

01:09:09.897 --> 01:09:10.897
- That's the end of it.

01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:12.982
- Say, man, now put this shit on.

01:09:12.983 --> 01:09:14.399
Props in the bag.

01:09:14.401 --> 01:09:16.362
- Oh, terrific, the bag.

01:09:18.072 --> 01:09:19.072
I must say, though, ladies,

01:09:19.073 --> 01:09:20.698
you have given me the most extraordinary

01:09:20.698 --> 01:09:22.200
week of my life.

01:09:22.201 --> 01:09:23.243
- Oh, sweetie.

01:09:23.243 --> 01:09:24.077
- Really.

01:09:24.078 --> 01:09:25.870
- Aw, man, you know, you're
gonna do good out here

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:28.872
in the city with that
wig and that metal hand.

01:09:28.874 --> 01:09:31.042
Lime green pants.

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:31.919
- Mm, duty.

01:09:33.546 --> 01:09:34.379
- Honor.

01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:36.256
- And responsibility.

01:09:36.256 --> 01:09:38.466
- Hey, be the Doctor, baby.

01:09:39.593 --> 01:09:41.970
(funk music)

01:09:52.523 --> 01:09:53.648
- Doctor, my man!

01:09:53.649 --> 01:09:54.732
Give me five, man.

01:09:54.733 --> 01:09:56.985
- I'll give you 20 and
you can keep the change.

01:09:56.986 --> 01:09:59.070
- You're too much, man, too much, yeah.

01:09:59.071 --> 01:10:00.530
See you at the Player's Ball, my man, huh?

01:10:00.531 --> 01:10:03.533
- Uh, all right, all right.

01:10:03.534 --> 01:10:05.326
- That was great, that was great.

01:10:05.327 --> 01:10:06.161
- What's the Player's Ball?

01:10:06.162 --> 01:10:06.995
- Nothing, nothing.

01:10:06.996 --> 01:10:07.829
Be cool, be cool.

01:10:07.830 --> 01:10:08.663
Hi!

01:10:08.664 --> 01:10:09.497
- My man Doctor Detroit!

01:10:09.498 --> 01:10:10.290
I heard you wiped Mom out.

01:10:10.291 --> 01:10:11.291
How did you do it?

01:10:11.292 --> 01:10:13.626
- You might say I
rearranged her front end.

01:10:13.627 --> 01:10:14.752
- Set it out!

01:10:14.753 --> 01:10:16.421
You know you're gonna be
king of the Player's Ball.

01:10:16.422 --> 01:10:18.173
Ain't no doubt about it.

01:10:18.174 --> 01:10:19.299
- Beautiful.

01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:20.300
(laughs)

01:10:20.301 --> 01:10:21.467
Terrific.

01:10:21.468 --> 01:10:23.094
All right, what is the Player's Ball

01:10:23.095 --> 01:10:24.137
they keep talking about?

01:10:24.138 --> 01:10:26.139
- It's tomorrow night, honey,
that's okay I'll protect you.

01:10:26.140 --> 01:10:27.682
- Tomorrow night I have
a prior engagement.

01:10:27.683 --> 01:10:29.475
I can't go, I can't go.

01:10:29.476 --> 01:10:31.102
Oh no, where is it?

01:10:31.103 --> 01:10:33.062
- Somebody picks a place
and we all show up there.

01:10:33.063 --> 01:10:33.897
- Right.

01:10:33.898 --> 01:10:35.106
- It's a subcultural event, sweetheart,

01:10:35.107 --> 01:10:36.774
it's our responsibility to be there.

01:10:36.775 --> 01:10:37.901
- Oh, I can't be there, I can't.

01:10:37.902 --> 01:10:38.776
I just can't, I can't...

01:10:38.777 --> 01:10:40.486
(ladies exclaiming)

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:41.321

01:10:41.322 --> 01:10:42.197
- Cliff, what is...

01:10:42.198 --> 01:10:44.324
- Open your eyes now.

01:10:44.325 --> 01:10:45.950
- Give him air, give him air.

01:10:45.951 --> 01:10:48.620
- Tomorrow night is the
college alumni dinner.

01:10:48.621 --> 01:10:49.454
- Where?

01:10:49.455 --> 01:10:51.289
- At the Excelsior Hotel
and I have to be there.

01:10:51.290 --> 01:10:53.458
Now, I don't know where or
what your Player's Ball is,

01:10:53.459 --> 01:10:56.252
but I simply cannot be
in two places at once.

01:10:56.253 --> 01:10:57.086
- Yes, you can.

01:10:57.087 --> 01:10:58.755
Yes, you can, we'll
take care of everything.

01:10:58.756 --> 01:10:59.672
- [Monica] Right.

01:10:59.673 --> 01:11:01.591
- Now, how are we gonna do that?

01:11:01.592 --> 01:11:03.009
- Shh!

01:11:03.010 --> 01:11:03.843
- [Karen] Loosen his built.

01:11:03.844 --> 01:11:07.556
- Oh, Karen, get your
mind out of the gutter.

01:11:10.601 --> 01:11:12.644
Oh, Jesus Christ, do you
think this is gonna work?

01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:13.478
- Sure, it'll work.

01:11:13.479 --> 01:11:14.938
Sure.
- Okay.

01:11:14.939 --> 01:11:15.772
- [Man] Yeah, it's Eddie here.

01:11:15.773 --> 01:11:16.731
Your dime, go ahead.

01:11:16.732 --> 01:11:17.565
- Yo, Eddie.

01:11:17.566 --> 01:11:18.399
- [Eddie] Yeah?

01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:19.234
- What's happening?

01:11:19.235 --> 01:11:20.068
It's Diavolo.

01:11:20.069 --> 01:11:20.902
- Oh, go ahead, Diavolo.

01:11:20.903 --> 01:11:22.070
- Listen, Eddie, if the Doctor is king,

01:11:22.071 --> 01:11:24.614
then he picks and chooses the
place he wants to be crowned.

01:11:24.615 --> 01:11:25.531
- [Eddie] Well, it's gonna go down.

01:11:25.532 --> 01:11:26.366
This is it, right?

01:11:26.367 --> 01:11:27.200
- Uh-huh.

01:11:27.201 --> 01:11:28.034
- [Eddie] Don't jive me, man.

01:11:28.035 --> 01:11:29.577
- Well, listen, I'll tell
you where it's gonna be.

01:11:29.578 --> 01:11:31.996
Uh, the Excelsior Hotel

01:11:31.997 --> 01:11:32.956
- [Eddie] Excelsior Hotel.

01:11:32.957 --> 01:11:33.831
- That's downtown.

01:11:33.832 --> 01:11:34.666
- [Eddie] Is that right?

01:11:34.667 --> 01:11:35.500
- I'm pretty sure you're familiar

01:11:35.501 --> 01:11:36.334
with that area, brother.

01:11:36.335 --> 01:11:37.835
- [Eddie] Well, I'll ask around, man.

01:11:37.836 --> 01:11:38.670
- Yeah.

01:11:38.671 --> 01:11:39.504
- [Eddie] Later on.

01:11:39.505 --> 01:11:40.338
- The Doctor will be there.

01:11:40.339 --> 01:11:41.172
- [Eddie] He better be.

01:11:41.173 --> 01:11:42.799
- Later.

01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:43.633

Clifford, I see that your friend is here.

Does that mean that you'll
be leaving us again?

01:13:33.285 --> 01:13:34.410
- No, absolutely not.

01:13:34.411 --> 01:13:36.996
My duty is to my home,
my family, the college,

Will you get him out of here?

You're going to ruin everything.

I've got to introduce Rousehorn.

He's going to give money to the college.

01:14:04.066 --> 01:14:05.817
- Cliff, you've got to, man.

01:14:05.818 --> 01:14:08.277
There are four beautiful
women depending on you.

01:14:08.278 --> 01:14:10.363

01:14:10.364 --> 01:14:12.031

01:14:12.032 --> 01:14:15.494
- There is if you believe in him, brother.

01:14:18.122 --> 01:14:19.163
- All right.

01:14:19.164 --> 01:14:20.665
Quick, before I change my mind.

01:14:20.666 --> 01:14:24.252
- Straight through the
kitchen door, now hurry up.

01:14:24.253 --> 01:14:25.086
Come on, man, put the hair on.

01:14:25.087 --> 01:14:26.129
To the right, to the right.

01:14:26.130 --> 01:14:28.256
- If my parents ever see
me they'll disown me.

01:14:28.257 --> 01:14:29.799
- Check out the lining
in this jacket, man!

01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.883
You might as well wear it inside out.

01:14:30.884 --> 01:14:32.428
Do the pants match?

01:14:33.846 --> 01:14:35.638
- No, they won't work,
the lining's purple!

01:14:35.639 --> 01:14:36.597
- Looks just fine.

01:14:36.598 --> 01:14:37.432
Come on.

01:14:37.433 --> 01:14:38.767
Come on, move it!

01:14:41.645 --> 01:14:42.478
Move it, man, come on!

01:14:42.479 --> 01:14:43.312
- This is so insane.

01:14:43.313 --> 01:14:46.899
I don't know how you made me do this.

01:14:46.900 --> 01:14:48.443
- Those underwear look nice, man.

01:14:48.444 --> 01:14:49.777
- How about these tuxedo pants?

01:14:49.778 --> 01:14:50.987
They were Grandpa Skridlow's.

01:14:50.988 --> 01:14:51.946
He had sensitive legs.

01:14:51.947 --> 01:14:53.489
He had to have satin near
his skin at all times.

01:14:53.490 --> 01:14:55.074
- Yeah, let's move, let's move.

01:14:55.075 --> 01:14:56.868
Doing just fine.

01:14:56.869 --> 01:14:58.453
- The glasses, the glasses, where--

01:14:58.454 --> 01:14:59.287
- You got 'em.

01:14:59.288 --> 01:15:00.121

but unfortunately, I have business

01:17:55.631 --> 01:17:56.756
in another part of the hotel,

01:17:56.757 --> 01:17:58.716
a prior commitment, actually.

01:17:58.717 --> 01:18:01.844
A small chiropractic service
I was supposed to perform.

01:18:01.845 --> 01:18:03.888
(snaps)

01:18:03.889 --> 01:18:05.014
But uh...

01:18:05.015 --> 01:18:09.060
If anybody is a king here
tonight, it is this man,

01:18:09.061 --> 01:18:09.977
Mr. Try Me,

01:18:09.978 --> 01:18:10.895
Mr. Please Please Please,

01:18:10.896 --> 01:18:12.647
Mr. This Is A Man's World.

01:18:12.648 --> 01:18:14.774
I give you the hardest
working man in show business,

01:18:14.775 --> 01:18:16.734
ladies and gentlemen, James Brown!

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.110
(crowd cheering)

01:18:18.111 --> 01:18:19.821
Thank you, thank you.

01:18:21.281 --> 01:18:22.907
Thank you, excuse me.

01:18:22.908 --> 01:18:23.741
Excuse me.

01:18:23.742 --> 01:18:25.452
Thank you, excuse me.

01:18:30.666 --> 01:18:31.832
- [Crowd] Ooh-ooh!

01:18:31.833 --> 01:18:33.709
Doctor Detroit!

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:36.672
(suspenseful music)

01:18:42.969 --> 01:18:43.969
- Excuse me.

01:18:43.970 --> 01:18:45.096
- What the...

01:18:45.097 --> 01:18:45.930
What the heck's going on?

01:18:45.931 --> 01:18:49.476
(kitchen staff chattering)

01:18:52.270 --> 01:18:53.562
- Hi, Mom.

01:18:53.563 --> 01:18:54.773
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

01:18:56.983 --> 01:18:59.402
- I just saw someone we know.

01:18:59.403 --> 01:19:00.195
Boys.

01:19:14.251 --> 01:19:18.713
- (sighs) How are the hors d'oeuvres?

01:19:18.714 --> 01:19:20.256
- Mezzo mezzo.

01:19:20.257 --> 01:19:22.425
- I'm so glad you could join us, Cliff.

01:19:22.426 --> 01:19:25.554
- Thanks, I'm so glad I could make it.

01:19:27.305 --> 01:19:28.222
- Hey, Fruit Cup.

01:19:28.223 --> 01:19:29.348
- Yes, I'll have one, thank you.

01:19:29.349 --> 01:19:31.517
- No, I mean you, Fruit Cup.

01:19:31.518 --> 01:19:34.062
Mom wants to see you right now.

01:19:36.231 --> 01:19:37.064
(silverware clattering)

01:19:37.065 --> 01:19:38.482
- Uh, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:38.483 --> 01:19:40.609
(clanking glasses)

01:19:40.610 --> 01:19:43.154
Uh, please, your attention.

01:19:43.155 --> 01:19:44.948
Your attention please.

01:19:45.907 --> 01:19:50.745
Faculty and alumni of
Monroe College and guests,

01:19:50.746 --> 01:19:53.998
tonight is a very special
night for the college.

01:19:53.999 --> 01:19:56.041
- He's introducing him before the entree.

01:19:56.042 --> 01:19:59.044
- And uh, to explain why, I'll introduce

01:19:59.045 --> 01:20:01.046
our distinguished guest of honor,

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:04.383
himself an alumnus of
Monroe, a philanthropist,

01:20:04.384 --> 01:20:05.217
Doctor of Humane Letters...

01:20:05.218 --> 01:20:06.135
- Hi, there.

01:20:06.136 --> 01:20:08.053
- And Chief Executive Officer and Chairman

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:10.264
of Rousehorn Consolidated Industries,

01:20:10.265 --> 01:20:12.558
Mr. Harmon Rousehorn.

01:20:12.559 --> 01:20:15.270
(crowd applauds)

01:20:16.813 --> 01:20:18.731
- You introduced him before the entree.

01:20:18.732 --> 01:20:19.565
- Excuse me, excuse me.

01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:23.068
- And our friend, our colleague...

01:20:23.069 --> 01:20:24.571
Look out, watch it!

01:20:33.079 --> 01:20:36.041
(guests chattering)

01:20:37.751 --> 01:20:40.128
(funk music)

01:20:45.258 --> 01:20:46.467
- Hey, Doctor, what's happening, baby?

01:20:46.468 --> 01:20:47.301
What's moving out there?

01:20:47.302 --> 01:20:49.261
- Oh, sweetheart, I'm so proud of you!

01:20:49.262 --> 01:20:51.680
- It is imperative that we leave
these premises immediately.

01:20:51.681 --> 01:20:52.515
- Why?

01:20:52.516 --> 01:20:53.849
- But the party's just getting started.

01:20:53.850 --> 01:20:54.683
- Man, what's the matter?

01:20:54.684 --> 01:20:55.768
Why do we have to leave, huh?

01:20:55.769 --> 01:20:56.602
- [Man] Mom!

01:20:56.603 --> 01:20:57.937
- [All] Mom?

01:20:57.938 --> 01:20:58.771
- That's why.

01:20:58.772 --> 01:20:59.605
- Mom?

01:20:59.606 --> 01:21:00.481
- Well, who do you think?

01:21:00.482 --> 01:21:02.983
No one starts this party without me.

01:21:02.984 --> 01:21:04.527
Get the son of a bitch!

01:21:04.528 --> 01:21:06.905
(exclaiming)

01:21:18.917 --> 01:21:21.836
- Look out, Doctor on call!

01:21:21.837 --> 01:21:23.546
Emergency house call!

01:21:23.547 --> 01:21:24.421
Emergency!

01:21:24.422 --> 01:21:25.840
Doctor on call!

01:21:25.841 --> 01:21:28.676
(crashing)

01:21:28.677 --> 01:21:29.553
- Look out!

01:21:30.679 --> 01:21:32.389
Out of the way, move!

01:21:35.350 --> 01:21:36.142
- Oh, oh!

01:21:37.519 --> 01:21:40.229
- I'm gonna kick your ass!

01:21:40.230 --> 01:21:41.063
(cookware clattering)

01:21:41.064 --> 01:21:42.439
- I warn you, I'm a chiropractor!

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:44.859
I will use my skill negatively.

01:21:44.860 --> 01:21:46.277
There are radioactive
isotopes in this bag,

01:21:46.278 --> 01:21:47.111
stay away!

01:21:47.112 --> 01:21:48.320
- You're dead!

01:21:48.321 --> 01:21:49.446
- You're mine, Detroit!

01:21:49.447 --> 01:21:51.240
You're mine!

01:21:51.241 --> 01:21:53.117
(crowd exclaiming)

01:21:53.118 --> 01:21:54.994
En garde, madame!

01:21:54.995 --> 01:21:59.456
I have you now at a supreme
disadvantage (laughs)

01:21:59.457 --> 01:22:01.251
- Like hell, you have!

01:22:03.670 --> 01:22:05.254
- Hey, you're crazy!

01:22:05.255 --> 01:22:06.422
- I'll stick him!

01:22:06.423 --> 01:22:08.215
- Are you nuts?

01:22:08.216 --> 01:22:11.927
- And now, in closing,
I'd like to present to you

01:22:11.928 --> 01:22:15.973
on behalf of Rousehorn
Consolidated Industries,

01:22:15.974 --> 01:22:18.434
this meager endowment.

01:22:18.435 --> 01:22:21.729
(Mr. Skridlow crashes)
(crowd applauding)

01:22:21.730 --> 01:22:23.689
- I'm so nervous!

01:22:23.690 --> 01:22:25.816
Clifford should be here.

01:22:25.817 --> 01:22:28.235
Well, uh, this is a uh...

01:22:28.236 --> 01:22:29.987
This is a great, great day for--

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:34.950
(Cliff shouting)
(epees clacking)

01:22:34.951 --> 01:22:36.578
- I defy you, woman!

01:22:40.749 --> 01:22:43.627
(guests clamoring)

01:22:44.920 --> 01:22:47.464
(Mom shouting)

01:22:49.257 --> 01:22:50.050
Yeah!

01:22:54.262 --> 01:22:58.224
- Excuse me, excuse me,
this is a private party!

01:22:59.225 --> 01:23:00.059
Who...

01:23:00.060 --> 01:23:01.770
Who are these people?

01:23:03.271 --> 01:23:05.648
- 500 on the Doctor, huh?

01:23:05.649 --> 01:23:07.900
(spoon tapping glass)

01:23:07.901 --> 01:23:11.278
- Excuse me, excuse me,
this is a private party.

01:23:11.279 --> 01:23:13.490
(clanging)

01:23:19.663 --> 01:23:22.081
(crowd gasping)

01:23:22.082 --> 01:23:23.290
- It's Clifford!

01:23:23.291 --> 01:23:24.750
- Oh my God, no.

01:23:24.751 --> 01:23:26.628
- Yes, Mother, it's me.

01:23:29.547 --> 01:23:30.381
Aha!

01:23:30.382 --> 01:23:31.174
Ha ha!

01:23:43.228 --> 01:23:44.979
- Okay, finish me.

01:23:44.980 --> 01:23:46.230
I'm not afraid to die, go ahead.

01:23:46.231 --> 01:23:49.483
- And I am fortunate in battle
and merciful in victory.

01:23:49.484 --> 01:23:51.902
Madame, I'll let the room decide.

01:23:51.903 --> 01:23:54.363
My good people, what'll it be?

01:23:54.364 --> 01:23:55.407
- [Crowd] No!

01:23:57.575 --> 01:23:58.784
- So be it!

01:23:58.785 --> 01:24:00.411
You're finished in this town, Mom.

01:24:00.412 --> 01:24:03.205
Through, banished,
exiled in your community.

01:24:03.206 --> 01:24:05.499
Ladies and gentlemen, the
Doctor is a compassionate man!

01:24:05.500 --> 01:24:07.251
Throw this trash bag out

01:24:07.252 --> 01:24:09.670
and never let her darken
Cook County again.

01:24:09.671 --> 01:24:12.382
(crowd cheering)

01:24:14.217 --> 01:24:15.843
- Shut up!

01:24:15.844 --> 01:24:16.636
My arm!

01:24:18.388 --> 01:24:19.930
You'll pay for this, do you hear me?

01:24:19.931 --> 01:24:22.434
I'll be back!

01:24:26.146 --> 01:24:27.646
- My good people, I pray,

01:24:27.647 --> 01:24:30.942
a moment of your attention here, please!

01:24:31.985 --> 01:24:33.778
- One million dollars!

01:24:35.113 --> 01:24:36.613
And I thought you were cheap!

01:24:36.614 --> 01:24:38.115
(crowd cheering)
I didn't mean...

01:24:38.116 --> 01:24:40.200
- Clifford, you've made us so proud.

01:24:40.201 --> 01:24:42.619
- I thank you, sir, and
the college thanks you

01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:44.455
and my parents thank you.

01:24:44.456 --> 01:24:48.417
(raspy) And the Doctor thanks you.

01:24:48.418 --> 01:24:50.961
But the Doctor is no more.

01:24:50.962 --> 01:24:51.837
(snaps)

01:24:51.838 --> 01:24:55.466
He existed only to
banish an evil presence.

01:24:55.467 --> 01:24:56.884
And let it be known to all here

01:24:56.885 --> 01:24:59.219
that the damsels whom Mom
would have held captive

01:24:59.220 --> 01:25:00.013
are free.

01:25:01.097 --> 01:25:04.767
My ladies Karen, Thelma, Monica, Jasmine,

01:25:04.768 --> 01:25:06.769
you are beholden to none.

01:25:06.770 --> 01:25:09.521
And Diavolo, my trusted comrade,

01:25:09.522 --> 01:25:11.899
perhaps we may ride again.

01:25:11.900 --> 01:25:13.942
For whenever intimidation and injustice

01:25:13.943 --> 01:25:16.862
vie with decency and honor,
let the Doctors arise,

01:25:16.863 --> 01:25:18.405
and arise they must.

01:25:18.406 --> 01:25:20.824
For within every one of
us, there is a Doctor,

01:25:20.825 --> 01:25:23.327
a dormant Doctor, a supreme arbitrator,

01:25:23.328 --> 01:25:24.828
who can be summoned to intervene

01:25:24.829 --> 01:25:27.790
when crises threaten the
stabilities and well beings

01:25:27.791 --> 01:25:29.500
of our heartlands.

01:25:29.501 --> 01:25:32.419
(crowd cheering)

01:25:32.420 --> 01:25:33.713
Now let's party!

01:25:35.799 --> 01:25:38.176
(funk music)

01:25:41.846 --> 01:25:44.681
- I have endowed a madman.

01:25:44.682 --> 01:25:46.059
Why couldn't I...

01:25:46.935 --> 01:25:49.144
Why couldn't I have gone to Yale?

01:25:49.145 --> 01:25:51.146
Or Syracuse, even?

01:25:51.147 --> 01:25:53.148
- Why don't you tell me about it?

01:25:53.149 --> 01:25:55.192
What's wrong, huh?

01:25:55.193 --> 01:25:59.363
