They wanna take our money?

00:07.007 --> 00:08.747
Not yet, but they have
frozen our accounts.

00:08.834 --> 00:11.315
You can take care of this
with my help.

00:11.402 --> 00:12.621
And what would I
have to do for you?

'This is so messed up.'

00:14.579 --> 00:16.364
[Catherine]
'Your ex dating my stepson?
Yes, it is.'

00:16.451 --> 00:18.018
I didn't sign up
for some creepy love triangle

00:18.105 --> 00:19.367
with you and someone's mom!

00:19.454 --> 00:20.759
She's giving me money.

00:20.846 --> 00:23.110
You have no idea
how I feel about Nate

00:23.197 --> 00:24.850
and what I would do
to keep him.

00:24.937 --> 00:26.156
Do you wanna
be with this woman?

00:26.243 --> 00:27.679
No, I wanna be with you.

00:27.766 --> 00:29.029
I am out for good.

00:29.116 --> 00:31.161
In spite of my lowly,
unroyal ways

00:31.248 --> 00:33.120

true feelings for Marcus

00:33.207 --> 00:34.469
and that he has them
for me, too.

00:34.556 --> 00:35.731

00:36.688 --> 00:38.255
Marcus!

[Blair]
'No, I knew it was him,
but I want you.'

00:40.431 --> 00:42.912
You want my title,
which makes me a fool.

00:42.999 --> 00:45.697
- Idowant you.
- Then show me.

00:45.784 --> 00:47.612
- Well, I was on a..
- On.. On a date?

00:47.699 --> 00:49.701
Yeah, I was gonna
tell you guys I've been dating.

00:49.788 --> 00:53.140
We keep having this same fight.
I can't change who I am.

00:53.227 --> 00:54.576
Me neither.

When I step out of here,
it's over.

01:02.062 --> 01:03.759
[Gossip Girl]
And who am I?

01:03.846 --> 01:07.023
That's a secret
I'll never tell.

Welcome to the first day
of senior year

01:18.121 --> 01:21.037
and the onset
of a new social dynasty.

01:21.124 --> 01:22.647
The big question is

01:22.734 --> 01:25.215
with Serena single
and on top of the world

01:25.302 --> 01:28.392
will Constance become
the house of Van Der Woodsen?

01:28.479 --> 01:30.307
I can't believe you got Bart
to wear flip-flops.

01:30.394 --> 01:31.961
I can't even picture that.

01:32.048 --> 01:34.224
It was so cute. Every time we'd
go for a walk on the beach

01:34.311 --> 01:37.271
I'd catch him staring down
at his feet.

01:37.358 --> 01:39.751
Mom, it all sounds so romantic.

01:39.838 --> 01:41.927
We expecting more people?

01:42.014 --> 01:44.278
Well, um, it is
your first day of school

01:44.365 --> 01:46.193
and I was trying
to be motherly.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.803
Mom, I can't believe
you didn't wake me up

01:47.890 --> 01:49.500
when you got home last night.
I feel cheated.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.329
Last time you said you felt
violated. Welcome home.

01:52.416 --> 01:54.375
Say mom, and I will
kill you in your sleep.

01:54.462 --> 01:57.465
Decaf, Serena.
I was going to say Mrs. Bass.

01:57.552 --> 02:00.903
Thank you, Charles. Um, Bart had
to fly to Beijing on business

02:00.990 --> 02:03.079
but he sends his best.

02:03.166 --> 02:04.820
As he has done
since kindergarten.

02:04.907 --> 02:08.345
Okay. Hello. We were
talking romantic getaway

02:08.432 --> 02:10.173
walkin' on the beach.
Details.

02:10.260 --> 02:13.611
I could stay home, and then we
could go to lunch together.

02:13.698 --> 02:15.047
Stay home? It's your
first day of--

02:15.135 --> 02:16.484
Serena and Dan broke up.

02:16.571 --> 02:19.313
Tragic, if not
entirely unprecedented.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.838
Not without an upside.
Humphrey was holding you back.

02:22.925 --> 02:24.405
You're a born queen.

02:25.971 --> 02:28.365
This is your year to rule.
Why fight it?

02:28.452 --> 02:29.714
Because I don't want it,
okay?

02:29.801 --> 02:32.021
Being queen is
Blair's whole thing.

02:32.108 --> 02:35.503
Plus, if she needs a eunuch,
she knows where to look.

02:35.590 --> 02:38.549
You may feel differently
when the trumpets call.

02:38.636 --> 02:41.552
Grab the OJ.
There's champagne in the limo.

02:43.554 --> 02:45.817
He-he's kidding.

02:45.904 --> 02:47.210
I think.

02:52.955 --> 02:54.652
Well, so you broke up.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.611
I didn't even know you two
were back together.

02:56.698 --> 02:58.308
- Yeah.
- Are you okay?

02:58.395 --> 03:00.397
No, but I will be.

03:01.355 --> 03:02.617
I hope.

03:02.704 --> 03:04.575
I don't know.
Having to see him every day.

03:04.662 --> 03:08.666
It's-it's gonna be really hard.

03:08.753 --> 03:11.147
Well, you know what? Every day
gets a little bit easier.

03:11.234 --> 03:12.714
Yeah.

03:12.801 --> 03:14.759
- 'It'll be fine, right?'
- Of course it will.

03:14.846 --> 03:17.371
I mean, we-we broke up amicably.
No one cheated. No one screamed.

03:17.458 --> 03:19.068
You've got nothing
to worry about.

03:19.155 --> 03:20.417
Of course, I don't know
what the post breakup

03:20.504 --> 03:21.723
protocol is these days.

03:21.810 --> 03:23.377
Yeah, like she gets
the courtyard

03:23.464 --> 03:25.422
Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays,
and I get supervised visits

03:25.509 --> 03:27.119
with the library
every other weekend.

03:27.207 --> 03:29.078
You know, be honest
with where you're both at.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.862
Just do that, okay?

03:30.949 --> 03:32.560
And the deflection through
sarcasm thing you might wanna

03:32.647 --> 03:34.170
put on the back burner
for a while.

03:34.257 --> 03:37.652
I, uh, I heard your friend
sneak out early this morning.

03:37.739 --> 03:39.262

03:41.046 --> 03:44.049
Come on. High heels,

for a-a stealthy getaway.

whole going to school thing?

04:04.592 --> 04:05.810
Pretty set. Why?

of psychos

04:09.684 --> 04:11.686

04:11.773 --> 04:13.383
They categorize girls
into two groups.

04:13.470 --> 04:14.993
Projects and victims.

04:15.080 --> 04:16.995
Girls with the potential
to become little mini Blairites

04:17.082 --> 04:18.736
become projects
and total losers

04:18.823 --> 04:19.998
and the girls who
have the potential

04:20.085 --> 04:21.870
to threaten social order
become victims.

04:21.957 --> 04:25.221
I was a project last year and we
all know how that turned out.

04:25.308 --> 04:26.527
- What?
- Nothing.

04:26.614 --> 04:28.268
Totally with you.

Think of it as

So many slots on the
Chuck Bass social calendar.

No, wait. Just hold on
for a second.

06:47.581 --> 06:48.886
You crash the party

06:48.973 --> 06:50.497
and you tell me to break it off
with Catherine

06:50.584 --> 06:52.934

and you tell me to stay with her

I haven't seen her.

you're in the girls hallway

It's not so bad

it's better to be ignored

- No. Don't answer that.
- Break-ups are easy.
