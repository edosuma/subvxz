00:01.001 --> 00:02.167
<i>[Shauna] Previously on
I Am Shauna Rae...</i>

00:02.669 --> 00:04.069
So,

00:05.038 --> 00:08.640
I'm getting married
to my fiancé Jesse.

00:08.642 --> 00:10.876
But we're both gonna
be bridesmaids.

00:10.878 --> 00:13.078
Maybe I could
have two maid of honors.

00:13.080 --> 00:14.680
I don't wanna be
a maid of honor.

00:14.682 --> 00:17.616
Okay, then,
you're the maid of honor.

00:17.618 --> 00:20.652
It's not my responsibility to
throw the bachelorette party,

00:20.654 --> 00:22.955
it's the maid of honors
responsibility.

00:22.957 --> 00:26.525
I'm gonna change the wording,
it's my privilege.

00:29.529 --> 00:31.997
- [employee] Hello, how are you?
- Good, how are you?

00:31.999 --> 00:35.868
Tonight we're looking for
bridesmaid's dresses for Tara's wedding.

00:35.870 --> 00:37.102
- Are you excited?
- No.

00:37.370 --> 00:38.503
Rude.

00:38.505 --> 00:41.774
Doing things with Tara
makes me a little whisy-washy.

00:41.776 --> 00:45.544
Tara and Shauna their relationship
became a lot more adversarial.

00:45.546 --> 00:48.047
<i>And I think that's Shauna being</i>

00:48.049 --> 00:52.151
<i>jealous that Tara's living the
life that she should be living also.</i>

00:53.219 --> 00:54.253
Hi, Tara.

00:54.255 --> 00:57.322
I wanted to get some advice
about college.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.757
<i>Do not do online.</i>

00:58.759 --> 01:00.993
But, I'm good at it.

01:00.995 --> 01:04.997
Shauna and Tara
get along like oil and water.

01:04.999 --> 01:07.833
Like two pissed of cats
in a sack.

01:07.835 --> 01:11.403
<i>[Shauna] I know how to hurt
her and it doesn't always end well.</i>

01:19.879 --> 01:21.447
- [employee] Hello, how are you guys?
- Hi.

01:22.048 --> 01:23.982
You guys looking
for anything specific?

01:25.018 --> 01:27.886
We're here for
a bachelorette party.

01:27.888 --> 01:29.088
- Gotcha, gotcha.
- [Rylee] Yeah.

01:29.090 --> 01:30.355
It's gonna be

01:31.224 --> 01:32.724
- over in that direction.
- Thank you.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.193
No problem.

01:34.195 --> 01:36.261
My older sister, Tara,
is getting married

01:36.263 --> 01:38.931
and we recently went
bridesmaid dress shopping.

01:38.933 --> 01:40.899
The boobs are too big.

01:40.901 --> 01:45.003
Everything is too big,
it's not just the boobs.

01:45.005 --> 01:47.306
- Can I wear my combat boots?
- [everyone] No.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.807
Sorry.

01:48.809 --> 01:50.576
While she's been
planning the wedding,

01:50.578 --> 01:53.011
we've been planning
the bachelorette part.

01:53.013 --> 01:57.015
So, this afternoon we're going
shopping for some supplies.

01:57.017 --> 02:00.786
What'd you think would make
her the most uncomfortable?

02:00.788 --> 02:04.490
I'm getting married
to my fiancé Jesse.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.525
We're originally
from Pittsburgh.

02:06.527 --> 02:10.162
So I thought, Pittsburgh is
the perfect place to celebrate

02:10.164 --> 02:11.697
me getting married.

02:11.699 --> 02:13.298
<i>And I still have friends there.</i>

02:20.640 --> 02:22.908
Yeah, you have to hold it
with your legs.

02:22.910 --> 02:25.544
- That's weird, so grab the banana one.
- Yeah.

02:25.546 --> 02:30.749
I'm extremely nervous that Rylee
and Shauna are gonna surprise me

02:30.751 --> 02:34.019
with some raunchy stuff
at this bachelorette party.

02:34.021 --> 02:36.822
I do not want it to be gross.

02:36.824 --> 02:38.690
I don't want it to be raunchy.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.894
Why don't we grab a pack
of each confetti.

02:41.896 --> 02:44.029
So that way she has to
pick it out of her butt crack.

02:44.031 --> 02:45.864
You want two bags
of the little confetti?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.132
Sure, that's more annoying.

02:47.134 --> 02:49.234
Hello. Could I see some ID?

02:56.109 --> 02:57.242
Do I need to
take it out for you?

02:57.244 --> 02:59.111
Like, do you need to scan it?

02:59.113 --> 03:00.445
- No.
- Okay.

03:04.517 --> 03:05.751
Okay.

03:05.753 --> 03:08.053
- And then.
- Mines on my cellphone.

03:08.388 --> 03:09.955
- Gotcha, gotcha.
- Thanks.

03:09.957 --> 03:13.025
My first thought was, um,
is that a kid?

03:13.027 --> 03:15.494
I was a little shocked at first.

03:15.496 --> 03:19.097
But, um, you know, I was
surprised to say the least,

03:19.099 --> 03:23.035
once I found out that she was
an adult, both of them were.

03:24.270 --> 03:28.874
Apparently some other
customers in the store

03:28.876 --> 03:32.077
had the employee there come
up to us and ask for our ID.

03:32.079 --> 03:35.147
When people wanna verify
my age that pisses me off.

03:35.149 --> 03:37.516
Because most of the time
it's not for the business.

03:37.518 --> 03:39.718
It's not for myself
and my safety,

03:39.720 --> 03:41.820
it's for your nosiness.

03:41.822 --> 03:45.490
I'm not looking at you and looking
at what sex toys you're buying

03:45.492 --> 03:47.759
and making sure
I'm checking your ID.

03:47.761 --> 03:49.361
Mind your damn business!

03:51.130 --> 03:53.065
You want a penis pinata?

03:53.067 --> 03:54.233
I thought about it,

03:54.235 --> 03:57.469
but, I don't think she would
actually play with a pinata.

03:59.172 --> 04:03.175
I'm not going for playing with I'm
going to make her uncomfortable.

04:04.510 --> 04:06.178
Would it make her uncomfortable?

04:06.180 --> 04:08.113
- Yes.
- Okay, then we grab it.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.482
How hard is this?

04:15.588 --> 04:17.122
No, but it is now.

04:17.124 --> 04:22.127
Tara's definitely the most
different between the three of us.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.097
- Yeah, she's the most--
- Conservative.

04:25.099 --> 04:28.500
Shauna's the one that pushes,
like, the raunchy envelope.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.035
Publicly.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.036
- Raunchy envelope?
- Like, I don't know.

04:31.038 --> 04:32.838
- The raunchiness.
- Yes.

04:32.840 --> 04:35.941
In, like, public or with
our family, like our parents,

04:35.943 --> 04:38.677
it's like she has something
to prove.

04:38.679 --> 04:42.180
Like, she is an adult and she
is able to talk about this stuff.

04:42.849 --> 04:45.150
- Anything else?
- I think we're good.

04:45.152 --> 04:46.818
- I think we got too much.
- Are you sure?

04:46.820 --> 04:48.487
Cause I could shop all day.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.122
- I know you could.
- This is funny as hell.

04:57.864 --> 05:00.499
<i>[Shauna] We ended up getting
some party games.</i>

05:00.501 --> 05:03.201
- We got confetti.
- Vibrator.

05:03.203 --> 05:06.371
- She's gonna kill us.
- She's gonna kill us, but, it's gonna be worth it.

05:06.506 --> 05:07.439
Is it?

05:07.740 --> 05:08.973
Come on.

05:09.042 --> 05:12.177
What's better than doing this
to our conservative sister?

05:12.679 --> 05:15.580
I hope Tara's reaction
will be good.

05:15.582 --> 05:17.816
<i>It depends on the mood
Tara's in of course though.</i>

05:17.818 --> 05:20.886
If Tara's not in a good mood
when we give her the gifts

05:20.888 --> 05:22.154
she's just gonna
throw them back at us.

05:22.156 --> 05:23.088
That's true.

05:23.090 --> 05:24.790
Ugh, God.

05:24.792 --> 05:27.159
- Thank you.
- These are surprisingly heavy.

05:27.161 --> 05:28.960
Okay, I can take one bag.

05:38.037 --> 05:39.137
[loud banging]

05:39.972 --> 05:41.006
[Rylee] You good?

05:42.508 --> 05:44.109
Kind of.

05:44.111 --> 05:46.878
This afternoon we are
packing to fly to Pittsburgh

05:46.880 --> 05:48.513
for Tara's bachelorette weekend.

05:50.516 --> 05:52.050
What have you got to pack?

05:52.052 --> 05:53.452
- Uh, a lot.
- This.

05:53.454 --> 05:55.020
Where'd all this come from?

05:55.022 --> 05:58.490
We are packing everything
we bought from the adult store.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.126
Yeah, we're putting
most of that in one suitcase.

06:01.128 --> 06:04.363
Which is embarrassing
if that gets checked.

06:04.365 --> 06:06.331
- That's for Jesse.
- What the hell is that?

06:06.333 --> 06:08.633
It's for Jesse.

06:08.635 --> 06:09.634
[Patty] Too much.

06:10.937 --> 06:12.938
-This is a drinking game
-Okay, that's not so bad.

06:12.940 --> 06:16.007
Yeah, see, not all of it's bad.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.976
- We're just trying to make Tara uncomfortable.
- I don't know.

06:17.978 --> 06:19.778
I'm looking at this stuff,
and I'm like,

06:19.780 --> 06:21.246
these are my children?

06:21.248 --> 06:26.017
Our Mom is very conservative
when it comes to sex.

06:26.019 --> 06:28.453
I think the topic of

06:29.088 --> 06:31.390
adult stuff, like sex,
and all this stuff's

06:31.392 --> 06:33.925
kinda been a little uncomfortable
between Mom and I.

06:33.927 --> 06:37.195
So it's a little uncomfortable for
me to talk about that kinda stuff,

06:37.197 --> 06:40.198
and be like, look at this,
look at the penis pops.

06:40.200 --> 06:42.167
- What is this?
- They're gigolos.

06:45.338 --> 06:48.073
Because she likes sour candy!

06:50.143 --> 06:52.077
Pin the hose on the fire...

06:53.846 --> 06:55.781
- Yeah.
- Why do you hide everything?

06:55.815 --> 06:57.015
I don't know.

06:57.250 --> 06:59.785
Like, it's an x-ray machine,
they're gonna see everything.

06:59.787 --> 07:02.487
I'm not carrying this [beep].
So, it's all on you.

07:02.489 --> 07:04.055
Who's carrying this through?

07:10.062 --> 07:10.929
Okay.

07:10.931 --> 07:14.032
Our girls have never
travelled alone.

07:14.034 --> 07:15.801
I think it will definitely
be a good experience

07:15.803 --> 07:18.270
for them to travel
by themselves.

07:18.272 --> 07:21.406
But, my personally,
I'm just full of fear.

07:22.241 --> 07:23.208
There ya go, Ry.

07:23.409 --> 07:24.409
That's all yours.

07:25.178 --> 07:26.278
Yeah.

07:27.146 --> 07:28.513
That's a heavy penis case.

07:30.316 --> 07:32.517
Now that everything is packed.

07:32.519 --> 07:36.455
We're heading to the airport to fly to
Pittsburgh for the bachelorette party.

07:44.497 --> 07:46.164
[Shauna] I feel
like a potato sack.

07:48.501 --> 07:49.868
- A potato sack?
- Yeah.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.970
I'm just moving
all over the place.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.106
- [Rylee] It is a heavy bag.
- It's not that.

07:55.108 --> 07:58.076
It's the fact that my other
bag is against my butt.

07:58.078 --> 08:01.847
We have never
travelled together alone

08:01.849 --> 08:03.915
without our parents
or even Tara.

08:03.917 --> 08:05.050
I can take your bag.

08:05.052 --> 08:07.986
Nah, think smarter not harder.

08:07.988 --> 08:10.822
-Let's go.
-Okay. I can't do that either though.

08:10.824 --> 08:13.692
Our parents
don't want us to travel.

08:13.694 --> 08:15.293
They don't want Shauna...

08:15.295 --> 08:19.898
They won't let Shauna take
public transportation alone.

08:19.900 --> 08:22.767
So, Shauna travelling
was automatically a no-go.

08:22.769 --> 08:25.270
And then I just turned 18,

08:25.272 --> 08:28.773
so I was a child before, so of
course, they didn't want me going.

08:28.775 --> 08:30.075
I'm nervous.

08:30.077 --> 08:32.244
- I feel like I'm going to puke.
- Me too.

08:34.146 --> 08:36.281
You being nervous
is making me more nervous.

08:36.916 --> 08:38.116
She's scared of planes.

08:38.118 --> 08:39.818
- So that's a huge worry.
- Plane crashing.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.052
The engine failing.

08:41.054 --> 08:43.522
I could lose my hand from
her squeezing it so tightly.

08:43.524 --> 08:45.790
Engine failing,
bird flying into the engine.

08:45.792 --> 08:48.660
My main concern was getting
overwhelmed and getting lost,

08:48.662 --> 08:50.862
<i>and getting her
through the flight.</i>

08:50.864 --> 08:53.732
<i>Because she's already scared,
so I have to step up,</i>

08:53.734 --> 08:56.234
<i>but I'm freaking the
[beep] out on the inside.</i>

08:56.236 --> 08:58.503
It's just a whole panic
on panic situation.

08:58.505 --> 09:00.772
Yeah, I'm freaking out on
the inside and on the outside.

09:00.774 --> 09:03.108
So it's not good.

09:03.110 --> 09:05.810
Sad thing is, we're not even getting
on a plane to go somewhere nice.

09:05.812 --> 09:08.847
We're going back
to our homeland.

09:08.849 --> 09:09.881
[Rylee laughing] Our homeland.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.685
- I think Pittsburgh's nice.
- Pittsburgh's nice.

09:13.687 --> 09:18.089
If I have to travel by myself I think
my anxiety holds me back the most.

09:18.091 --> 09:21.860
<i>I think physically
I'm just very lost.</i>

09:21.862 --> 09:23.628
<i>And it's easy
to lose me as a person.</i>

09:23.630 --> 09:25.096
And I could get lost in a crowd

09:25.098 --> 09:26.264
and I don't know
where I'm going then.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.700
Do we just go anywhere?

09:28.702 --> 09:33.738
I think, just my size overall, has limited
my independence in multiple ways.

09:33.740 --> 09:36.675
Because I can't do the
same things the same ways

09:36.677 --> 09:38.076
other people do them.

09:39.445 --> 09:41.079
I can't go through
the same process,

09:41.081 --> 09:45.317
it takes me longer to start a
process and get through that process.

09:45.319 --> 09:47.185
But also, just,
the general public

09:47.187 --> 09:50.055
not having any respect
for someone like me.

09:50.057 --> 09:52.190
And not realizing
that I'm an adult

09:52.192 --> 09:54.159
and that I need
to be treated like one.

09:54.161 --> 09:55.293
It's just cold.

09:55.795 --> 09:56.494
Cold?

09:56.696 --> 09:58.229
Through the air-con.

09:58.531 --> 10:01.066
I can go out there and then someone's
gonna call Child Protective Services

10:01.068 --> 10:02.767
cause there's a child
running around alone.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.136
And then I'm going to have to
explain that whole situation.

10:05.138 --> 10:07.005
And God forbid that happens
while I'm travelling

10:07.007 --> 10:08.974
cause then I'm gonna
miss my flight.

10:13.713 --> 10:16.414
Okay, I'm gonna call... Where
are you? I'm gonna call Nai.

10:19.785 --> 10:22.988
Coming to Pittsburgh with us is,

10:22.990 --> 10:25.490
<i>Nai, my friend.
This is Rylee.</i>

10:25.492 --> 10:26.858
[Rylee] Hi, nice to meet you.

10:26.860 --> 10:30.762
Tara's friend Stephanie
and then Tara's friend Keely

10:30.764 --> 10:32.864
who we will meet
later within the weekend.

10:32.866 --> 10:35.967
This way, where it
says baggage claim.

10:35.969 --> 10:38.970
We have a lot of fun things
planned for Tara and the group.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.106
And some surprises too.

10:41.874 --> 10:44.409
[Shauna] Yay! We survived.

10:46.012 --> 10:49.080
So twerking is all about...
There ya go!

10:49.082 --> 10:53.118
When I heard they wanted to do
a pole dancing class,

10:53.120 --> 10:55.387
I thought, this is it.
This is where my life ends.

10:55.855 --> 10:57.322
[class screaming]

10:58.924 --> 11:01.693
I'm like, it's not in the knees
Tara, she's literally telling you.

11:01.695 --> 11:04.496
It looked like
you had to take a crap.

11:04.498 --> 11:07.265
Oh, my gosh. I'm not gonna
have a fiancé after this.

11:17.043 --> 11:20.745
- I got a tattoo.
- You did get a tattoo.

11:20.747 --> 11:21.980
It's beautiful.

11:25.518 --> 11:26.718
So how was your flight?

11:26.785 --> 11:28.053
Our flight was fine.

11:30.189 --> 11:33.992
We're in Pittsburgh celebrating
Tara's bachelorette weekend.

11:33.994 --> 11:37.495
-How was your flight? We didn't ask you.
-Yeah.

11:39.565 --> 11:41.132
My flight was fine.

11:41.734 --> 11:46.037
I made it late to Pittsburgh last night,
I got in around 12:30 in the morning.

11:46.039 --> 11:48.006
And then Stephanie came too.

11:48.174 --> 11:49.641
Yay!

11:49.643 --> 11:51.176
Oh, y'all gotta go.

11:51.178 --> 11:54.079
I have a meeting
that y'all cannot be privy to.

11:54.081 --> 11:55.947
- So.
- [Naiyh] Rude.

11:55.949 --> 11:57.482
- Goodbye.
- Kicking us out.

11:57.484 --> 11:59.350
[Shauna] It's not
that interesting.

11:59.352 --> 12:03.421
Today I actually have a virtual
conference that I have for school.

12:03.423 --> 12:07.258
So I have to do that
before we get wild tonight.

12:11.797 --> 12:13.031
Is this the right way?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.999
You ready for this?

12:15.001 --> 12:17.502
- [Stephanie] No.
- None of them have seen what's in this case.

12:19.839 --> 12:21.039
I'm a little scared.

12:24.043 --> 12:27.512
- A pinata.
- That is a lot of penises.

12:27.514 --> 12:29.147
Yeah, that's the point.

12:29.149 --> 12:33.118
I think Tara might be a good
sport about the decorations.

12:33.185 --> 12:34.519
Might be too much.

12:36.722 --> 12:38.590
- [Naiyh] Glitter.
- Glitter.

12:38.592 --> 12:40.492
- [Stephanie] Confetti.
- Oh, they're little sperm.

12:40.494 --> 12:42.794
- [Shauna] Yeah.
- [Rylee] We have a lot of stuff.

12:42.796 --> 12:45.363
So we should be able
to fully decorate this.

12:45.931 --> 12:47.365
They're thing is raunchy.

12:48.134 --> 12:49.834
I don't wanna be raunchy.

12:49.836 --> 12:52.704
<i>I want my tea and crumpets,
I want my brunch.</i>

12:52.706 --> 12:53.471
<i>And that's it.</i>

12:54.173 --> 12:56.274
<i>They are not like that at all.</i>

12:56.276 --> 12:58.109
They wanna have fun and party.

12:58.111 --> 13:02.247
Okay. If I came in like Tara,
this is a lot.

13:06.018 --> 13:07.986
So the more she's like,
brunch and stuff,

13:07.988 --> 13:09.521
the more I'm going to push
the bad stuff.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.256
- The more strippers I want.
- Yeah.

13:11.258 --> 13:14.826
I'm like, you're just adding to amount
of penises that are gonna be shown.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.261
Like, good luck.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.202
So, I think we're good.

13:33.445 --> 13:35.113
[Rylee] After you.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.816
-Hello.
-[employee] Hi, guys. How are you?

13:37.818 --> 13:39.784
One of the activities
that we have planned

13:39.786 --> 13:41.519
for this weekend
is pole dancing.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.054
- Tara, we're celebrating you.
- Yes.

13:43.056 --> 13:45.890
I want you down center,
right in the front, right here.

13:45.892 --> 13:47.859
You two ladies can choose
one of those two poles.

13:47.861 --> 13:49.928
And then,
you can take that pole.

13:49.930 --> 13:51.696
We wanted to go pole dancing

13:51.698 --> 13:56.067
for Tara's bachelorette weekend
because Tara's a fitness guru.

13:56.069 --> 14:01.039
She's really into it and I know if she
heard, hey, we're doing something athletic

14:01.041 --> 14:03.641
she'd be more...
For coming to the weekend.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.311
So, we're gonna go pole dancing.

14:06.313 --> 14:09.113
So the first thing we wanna do
is our pole walk, okay.

14:09.115 --> 14:11.282
When I heard

14:11.284 --> 14:13.952
that they wanted to do
a pole dancing class

14:14.386 --> 14:15.753
I thought, this is it.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.188
This is where my life ends.

14:17.957 --> 14:21.492
You're gonna start
with your inside foot,

14:21.494 --> 14:24.295
the one closes to the pole
and just go for a little walk.

14:24.297 --> 14:27.031
You're gonna lean out
and away from the pole.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.133
Yes, very nice.

14:29.135 --> 14:30.902
You got it Shauna, nice.

14:30.904 --> 14:32.537
We've never had anybody
like Shauna.

14:32.539 --> 14:35.840
But, at the same time, pole
dancing really is for everybody.

14:35.842 --> 14:40.078
So, there's absolutely no reason
that they couldn't come and try it.

14:40.080 --> 14:43.014
So next, we're gonna
have Tink come up,

14:43.016 --> 14:44.682
show you another thing.
You guys doing all right?

14:44.684 --> 14:45.683
Yep.

14:45.685 --> 14:48.753
We had three teachers
for the pole dancing.

14:48.755 --> 14:52.891
And each one specializes in
different techniques or moves.

14:52.893 --> 14:55.994
The spin that I'm gonna
teach you now is the fireman.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.495
And I'm gonna
demonstrate it first.

14:57.497 --> 14:59.364
And then I'm gonna
walk you guys through it.

14:59.366 --> 15:00.965
So we take three steps,

15:00.967 --> 15:03.801
lock that ankle, take it down,

15:03.803 --> 15:05.904
up, and swivel back.

15:05.906 --> 15:08.673
Left, right, left ankle locks,

15:08.675 --> 15:12.777
lift in between, feet hit
the floor, and unwind.

15:12.779 --> 15:16.014
- This is messing me up.
- Yeah, I did that too.

15:17.149 --> 15:20.318
[Tink] Left, right,
lock that ankle.

15:20.320 --> 15:23.087
- See, I just can't.
- Just ignore it.

15:23.255 --> 15:24.422
I'm short.

15:25.524 --> 15:27.125
I'm short.

15:27.127 --> 15:30.595
Shauna and I had pole guards
on both of our poles.

15:30.597 --> 15:33.765
Which is this white plastic

15:33.767 --> 15:36.801
that is to keep you from hitting
a button at the bottom of the pole

15:36.803 --> 15:38.636
<i>that just spins the pole.</i>

15:38.638 --> 15:40.605
It was the size
of my calf basically.

15:40.607 --> 15:44.008
And most of pole dancing
is leg work.

15:44.010 --> 15:48.246
Which means, use your calves,
use your thighs, and use your ankles.

15:48.248 --> 15:51.082
Which all got clipped
by the pole guard.

15:51.084 --> 15:52.817
[instructor] We have
one more thing.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.085
[Shauna] Oh, God.

15:54.087 --> 15:57.188
This is the fun part,
we're gonna shake our butts.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.856
Are you ready for that?

15:58.858 --> 16:00.391
[Tara] Mine doesn't move.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.394
I've tried twerking before.

16:03.629 --> 16:05.029
It doesn't work out.

16:05.097 --> 16:09.634
And you're gonna act as if
someone's pulling this lower hip here,

16:09.636 --> 16:11.936
pushing it up,
and then pushing it back down.

16:11.938 --> 16:16.074
So twerking is all about...
There ya go!

16:16.076 --> 16:21.846
Twerking is all about learning how
to move your waist and your thighs.

16:21.848 --> 16:22.880
- So--
- [Tara screaming]

16:22.882 --> 16:23.948
[instructor] There ya go.

16:23.950 --> 16:26.851
[Shauna] I can do it!
It's not that difficult.

16:26.853 --> 16:28.019
The next one
that we're gonna do,

16:28.021 --> 16:30.855
we're are going to go
back and forth with our hips.

16:30.857 --> 16:34.092
So, hip to the right, hip
to the left, hip to the right.

16:34.094 --> 16:36.027
And you're just gonna act
as if your butt is not there.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.962
[Tara] I can jingle.

16:37.964 --> 16:39.397
[instructor] And then
you can shake it down.

16:39.898 --> 16:40.931
And use those arms.

16:41.033 --> 16:43.701
You practiced this stuff,
I don't wanna hear it.

16:43.703 --> 16:45.103
[instructor] Then shake it
back up.

16:46.005 --> 16:47.472
And then go back to our up down.

16:48.140 --> 16:49.874
Nice.

16:49.876 --> 16:51.609
<i>[Jill] Shauna
did do really well.</i>

16:51.611 --> 16:56.314
They all did, I was impressed with her spins
and actually her twerks were really good.

16:58.350 --> 17:01.119
Oh, my gosh. I'm not gonna
have a fiancé after this.

17:02.287 --> 17:03.821
I'm like, it's not
in the knees Tara,

17:03.823 --> 17:04.889
she's literally
telling you it's not.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.791
And you're like,
but am I doing it?

17:06.793 --> 17:09.360
It looked like
you had to take a crap.

17:10.195 --> 17:12.830
- All right, so, Tara.
- Yeah.

17:12.832 --> 17:14.932
Have you decided do you
want these lovely ladies

17:14.934 --> 17:16.167
to do all the work
while you sit back?

17:16.169 --> 17:17.969
- [Tara] Oh, yeah!
- [Shauna] No!

17:17.971 --> 17:19.670
- [Tara] Yes.
- [Shauna] [beep] no.

17:19.672 --> 17:20.905
- Yes.
- No.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.107
What is wrong with y'all!
This is my day!

17:23.109 --> 17:27.011
By the end, Tara had a choice
whether she could do a routine

17:27.013 --> 17:29.514
or all of us
had to do a routine.

17:29.516 --> 17:32.817
Tara of course decided
she wanted to sit down.

17:32.819 --> 17:34.452
So we had to do a routine.

17:37.056 --> 17:39.057
- Oh, yeah!
- [everyone screaming]

17:44.163 --> 17:46.097
I've made $100.

18:05.084 --> 18:07.018
Can't wait to get back
to the hotel,

18:07.020 --> 18:10.088
gotta a special surprise
for ya in the room.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.890
<i>So, can't wait to see
the look on your face.</i>

18:12.892 --> 18:16.160
<i>And then after that,
hit the clubs.</i>

18:16.162 --> 18:18.996
- Sounds like a good time to me.
- To you.

18:24.670 --> 18:25.870
[Tara] Oh, my God.

18:25.872 --> 18:28.473
- This is also for you.
- [Shauna] They're handcuffs.

18:28.475 --> 18:31.843
The presents were not tasteful.

18:31.845 --> 18:35.780
There's no chance that Shauna and Rylee are
gonna keep this a classy bachelorette party.

18:35.782 --> 18:36.814
So, I'm a little freaked out.

18:36.816 --> 18:38.416
I've always wanted one of these.

18:38.418 --> 18:41.185
Jesse must not be doing his job.

18:51.864 --> 18:54.832
<i>[Mark] While the girls are in
Pittsburgh doing the bachelorette party,</i>

18:54.834 --> 18:57.301
I figured it's a great time to
make a nice dinner for Patty

18:57.303 --> 18:59.504
and see if I can
grease some wheels.

19:05.944 --> 19:07.612
- Hello.
- Hi, baby.

19:07.614 --> 19:09.981
- What the hell is all this?
- [Mark laughing]

19:09.983 --> 19:15.253
When I come home and
Mark has dinner on the table,

19:15.255 --> 19:18.389
you know, candles and all
that stuff, I'm kinda like, hmm.

19:18.857 --> 19:19.924
What's up?

19:19.926 --> 19:21.726
So why'd you do this?

19:21.728 --> 19:24.962
Just for you.
We're not alone a lot.

19:29.301 --> 19:30.534
[In a French accent]
You want?

19:30.536 --> 19:33.104
- Oh, it's got eyes and everything.
- Yes, there you go.

19:35.073 --> 19:39.844
When I saw the steak
and lobster for dinner.

19:39.846 --> 19:42.380
Yeah, I did. I thought,
how much did this cost?

19:45.150 --> 19:46.284
[Mark] Here.

19:51.890 --> 19:53.524
Ew, I think it popped on me.

19:56.895 --> 20:00.298
Lobster can be romantic.

20:00.766 --> 20:01.765
But not with her.

20:03.835 --> 20:06.003
So is this what we're gonna do
when we get old,

20:06.005 --> 20:07.805
or when the kids are out
of the house, all the time?

20:07.807 --> 20:11.042
-Cause we're already old? Is that you you're...
-I take that back.

20:11.044 --> 20:14.412
I mean, I think I was
telling Rylee yesterday that

20:14.414 --> 20:16.280
we're supposed to be
like empty nesters right now.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.217
Our nest isn't empty.

20:19.219 --> 20:21.219
Would you be happy
being an empty nester?

20:21.221 --> 20:22.753
I don't know.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.123
Rylee and Shauna
moving out as...

20:26.858 --> 20:28.960
Well they talk about
moving in together.

20:30.028 --> 20:32.263
Yeah, what?
In to one of the rooms?

20:32.531 --> 20:33.864
True

20:33.999 --> 20:37.068
I don't think either one of them
knows what actually goes into

20:37.803 --> 20:39.136
- living on your own.
- Yeah.

20:39.138 --> 20:41.405
Well, if we were empty nesters,

20:42.307 --> 20:44.208
what would you think
we would do?

20:44.676 --> 20:46.077
We could do stuff.

20:46.079 --> 20:50.281
With Shauna specifically
when she moves out

20:50.283 --> 20:52.450
it's going to be
an adventure for all of us.

20:53.018 --> 20:54.218
That's for sure.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.022
I am going to
have to let her go.

20:58.323 --> 20:59.991
And make those mistakes.

21:00.092 --> 21:01.158
That I made.

21:01.493 --> 21:02.660
That you made.

21:02.662 --> 21:05.296
It's gonna be tough
just because, I mean,

21:06.365 --> 21:08.232
you just know
how vulnerable she is.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.268
Physically.

21:10.270 --> 21:12.236
I think I'll have to
work through some things.

21:12.371 --> 21:13.170
For sure.

21:13.172 --> 21:15.206
It's gonna be tougher
for Shauna.

21:16.008 --> 21:18.743
<i>[Rylee] Shauna and I
wanna move out.</i>

21:18.745 --> 21:22.780
I think our parents would
prefer us moving in together.

21:22.782 --> 21:26.050
I don't think our parents
want Shauna living on her own.

21:26.052 --> 21:28.286
I don't think
it's a question for me,

21:28.288 --> 21:30.855
I think they would let me
live anywhere, honestly.

21:30.857 --> 21:33.991
I think our parents are in complete
denial about move moving out.

21:33.993 --> 21:36.727
I don't know about you, and I
don't know how you feel about that.

21:36.729 --> 21:40.264
But I think they just want to
keep me in a little box.

21:40.266 --> 21:44.902
Oh, I know that they definitely think
you're going to stay with them forever.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.437
Oh, man.
I got [beep] all over me.

21:47.272 --> 21:48.939
I'm not real good at this.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.441
We better stick to

21:51.209 --> 21:52.276
sandwiches.

21:54.513 --> 21:55.946
But it's delicious.

21:56.214 --> 21:58.082
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

21:58.850 --> 22:01.485
So, our plans are basically,

22:01.487 --> 22:03.688
driver license, job,

22:03.690 --> 22:07.658
help Shauna get her
schooling for divers license.

22:07.660 --> 22:09.694
- Yeah.
- Cause that's gonna take longer than mine.

22:09.696 --> 22:11.662
Cause she has to
go through special steps.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.197
And then if I'm able
to drive by then,

22:13.199 --> 22:14.465
then I can help her
get to there.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.335
And then, hopefully, look at

22:19.104 --> 22:21.072
- Get the heck out.
- Mmm-hmm.

22:21.074 --> 22:23.040
[Patty] It was
very sweet of you.

22:23.042 --> 22:26.177
-Well, thank you.
-You're welcome. Thank you.

22:36.822 --> 22:38.589
[Rylee] The taco bar,
there's like three layers.

22:38.591 --> 22:40.091
Delicious.

22:40.093 --> 22:43.160
I think Tara's gonna be more
excited about the food than anything.

22:43.162 --> 22:45.262
Oh, yeah, she'll be like,
yes, food!

22:46.064 --> 22:48.099
The candy can be out.

22:48.967 --> 22:50.401
[Shauna] Huh, what?

22:55.907 --> 22:56.941
Oh, my God.

22:56.943 --> 22:58.442
- Hi.
- [Stephanie] Hey.

22:58.444 --> 23:00.845
This is very PG.

23:00.847 --> 23:03.481
- [Shauna] See, it's not that bad.
- [Stephanie] Not bad.

23:03.483 --> 23:07.785
We're gonna be seeing Tara and
Jesse back in New York for Halloween.

23:07.787 --> 23:12.189
So we, kinda, couldn't get too
riled for the bachelorette party.

23:12.191 --> 23:17.128
Or else Tara might still hold a
grudge when we're back home.

23:19.097 --> 23:21.298
Get me drunk. Who bought this?

23:23.235 --> 23:24.702
I have Shauna wear that.

23:24.704 --> 23:27.104
[Shauna] So, first the sash.

23:30.075 --> 23:32.510
- No.
- And you're wearing this to the club by the way.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.145
- [Shauna] Yeah.
- [Tara] How do you wear this?

23:37.015 --> 23:39.016
What is that?

23:40.519 --> 23:42.787
- Those are games.
- And this goes in your hair.

23:42.789 --> 23:45.689
You gotta help her Rylee,
I can't do the tall stuff.

23:45.691 --> 23:47.925
- Oh, I get a tiara.
- You get a tiara.

23:47.927 --> 23:51.228
- Watch her head.
- Oh, we have food.

23:51.230 --> 23:52.630
[Rylee] Oh, yeah,
that's the other thing.

23:52.632 --> 23:55.499
So, those are tacos.
Go make yourself something.

23:55.501 --> 23:58.002
I would definitely say
that our bachelorette party,

23:58.004 --> 24:00.738
if Shauna and I were to ever
have a bachelorette party,

24:00.740 --> 24:03.007
would definitely
be crazier than Tara's.

24:03.009 --> 24:05.843
- I don't even wanna be bored at my bachelorette party.
- No.

24:05.845 --> 24:08.045
And I'm not saying
her party was boring.

24:08.047 --> 24:11.849
But there was a couple moments
where awkward silence hit.

24:11.851 --> 24:15.152
And I don't want that
at my bachelorette party.

24:17.823 --> 24:20.324
- What is this?
- [Shauna] Those are tortilla shells.

24:20.326 --> 24:22.359
This is your new wedding ring.

24:23.028 --> 24:25.129
Uh, oh!

24:25.131 --> 24:26.230
[Shauna] Open it up.

24:26.531 --> 24:27.498
It's rainbow.

24:28.934 --> 24:30.000
[Shauna] Eat it.

24:31.203 --> 24:32.636
[Rylee] Oh, my God!

24:32.638 --> 24:34.939
It tastes good.

24:34.941 --> 24:38.342
There's no chance that Shauna and Rylee are
gonna keep this a classy bachelorette party.

24:39.744 --> 24:41.245
This is for Jesse.

24:42.514 --> 24:43.814
- Ew.
- This is for you.

24:43.816 --> 24:45.282
Target practice.

24:45.284 --> 24:47.184
The presents were not

24:47.719 --> 24:49.053
tasteful.

24:49.855 --> 24:51.989
[Shauna] It comes
with a little kit.

24:51.991 --> 24:53.657
I know you wanna
go a little further,

24:53.659 --> 24:55.192
cause she doesn't
want strippers.

24:55.694 --> 24:57.795
Um, I know Rylee's talked about

24:57.797 --> 24:59.997
maybe doing a blowup doll
instead of a stripper,

24:59.999 --> 25:01.298
and just putting
her in the corner.

25:01.300 --> 25:03.234
This is also for you.

25:04.069 --> 25:05.736
[Shauna] They're handcuffs.

25:05.738 --> 25:07.705
Who's wrists
are these gonna fit?

25:07.707 --> 25:09.974
- [Rylee] Tara, they open.
- [Shauna] They extend.

25:10.876 --> 25:14.178
What was your favorite?
What was your favorite item?

25:14.980 --> 25:17.815
Tara, what was your
favorite item?

25:17.817 --> 25:19.984
I got a back massager.

25:20.485 --> 25:22.119
Oh, a vibrator!

25:22.121 --> 25:25.456
She is way too excited for that!

25:27.959 --> 25:29.193
I've always wanted one of these.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.828
What the heck?

25:30.830 --> 25:34.131
Jesse must not be doing his job.

25:34.133 --> 25:36.734
Scared like it was Christmas
morning about a vibrator.

25:36.736 --> 25:38.569
Going, I've always wanted one.

25:38.571 --> 25:41.238
It would have been
an amazing back massager.

25:43.375 --> 25:46.911
For the bachelorette party we
had bought some games to play.

25:46.913 --> 25:49.880
- [Tara] What are you supposed to do with him?
- You pin them on him.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.048
- Where?
- Where it's supposed to belong.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.750
- [Rylee] You close your eye.
- Where does it belong?

25:52.752 --> 25:55.219
- [Shauna] In his peepee.
- Oh.

25:59.891 --> 26:03.093
Unfortunately we couldn't find
a blindfold while shopping.

26:03.095 --> 26:05.029
They were all sheer and lace.

26:05.031 --> 26:06.263
So, it's not like
they would work.

26:06.265 --> 26:07.731
How many time?

26:07.733 --> 26:08.999
[Rylee] Uh, let's do 10.

26:09.001 --> 26:11.835
[Tara] What? I'm gonna vomit.

26:11.837 --> 26:14.238
So we just closed our eyes
and we're gonna spin each other.

26:31.156 --> 26:32.422
So who's closest?

26:32.424 --> 26:35.092
- [Shauna] Tara almost did it on the doorknob.
- [Rylee] I know!

26:35.660 --> 26:38.162
I was like, wrong knob,
wrong knob.

26:38.164 --> 26:43.000
Tara does not know where a
penis is on a guy apparently.

26:43.002 --> 26:45.135
Maybe you're aiming
for the top part,

26:45.137 --> 26:46.503
or the bottom part,

26:46.871 --> 26:48.505
or the middle part.

26:48.507 --> 26:51.875
You can be aiming for
different areas on the body.

26:51.877 --> 26:54.144
I'm very confused
on your man's genitalia now.

26:55.981 --> 27:00.117
- I have no comment on my man's genitalia.
- How separate is it?

27:00.119 --> 27:04.188
The top part, the middle part, or
the bottom part, it's not a sandwich.

27:06.758 --> 27:09.360
So we're meeting Keely
at the club.

27:09.362 --> 27:11.929
Yeah, we're meeting Keely
at the club. She'll be there.

27:11.931 --> 27:14.732
Since I'm not old enough to go
clubbing with the rest of the girls,

27:14.734 --> 27:16.233
I'm gonna stay home.

27:16.235 --> 27:18.502
In the hotel.
I'm very excited.

27:18.504 --> 27:20.437
- My tiara's falling.
- Keep going.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.505
Keep going.

27:21.507 --> 27:23.007
See ya, bye-bye.

27:23.009 --> 27:25.609
Get out of my room.
No, no, no, no, no.

27:25.611 --> 27:28.078
- Tara, Tara.
- [Shauna] You're tiara.

27:30.115 --> 27:32.282
She's like, "Okay, let's
take a drink right here."

27:34.753 --> 27:37.488
I can't even see over the bar.

27:39.824 --> 27:44.995
And the fact that she's not understanding that
I'm already in an uncomfortable situation,

27:44.997 --> 27:46.163
<i>it just sets me off.</i>

27:59.077 --> 28:01.045
- Hi.
- Hello.

28:01.047 --> 28:05.082
We are going out to a bar
to have some fun.

28:05.084 --> 28:07.117
That is convincing.

28:07.119 --> 28:09.520
I don't know because fun is...

28:09.522 --> 28:13.190
It's a difficult word
for Tara to process.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.893
We've never been out, like,
at a club or a bar together.

28:15.895 --> 28:18.128
[group cheering]

28:25.070 --> 28:29.239
To start off, we went to the
actual bar to order a drink.

28:38.883 --> 28:40.184
[Tara] Sorry.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.986
<i>[Shauna] Tara did lie and
say none of us were single.</i>

28:42.988 --> 28:45.355
<i>I think she was trying
to look out for me</i>

28:45.357 --> 28:51.195
because I do not think a bar is a
good place for me to find a guy.

28:51.197 --> 28:55.265
<i>It's crowded, so most guys probably
aren't going to see me at a bar.</i>

28:55.267 --> 28:59.369
I'm not looking for marriage or, like,
something super serious right now,

28:59.371 --> 29:03.107
but having Tara's bachelorette
party and her wedding coming up,

29:03.109 --> 29:06.710
it does make me think about
those things later down the line.

29:06.712 --> 29:09.847
And it makes me want
to find a partner.

29:09.849 --> 29:13.951
I recently had the matchmaker set me
up on a date with a guy named Abraham

29:13.953 --> 29:15.119
and it went pretty well.

29:15.121 --> 29:16.353
This was a great time.

29:16.521 --> 29:17.888
Thank you.

29:17.890 --> 29:20.057
- We should do this again 'cause--
- Yeah, we can hang out again.

29:20.059 --> 29:22.693
[Abraham] Yes, that would be
awesome. Give me some love.

29:22.695 --> 29:23.961
That's awesome.

29:23.963 --> 29:26.430
Abraham and I have still
kept in touch after the date,

29:26.432 --> 29:29.199
but I'm still open
to meeting other people.

29:32.804 --> 29:37.407
<i>At the bar, it was these women
over there in the other side of the bar,</i>

29:37.409 --> 29:40.344
pulling out their phones.

29:40.346 --> 29:43.514
<i>I don't go to clubs or I
don't go to bars specifically</i>

29:43.516 --> 29:45.082
<i>because of those situations.</i>

29:48.353 --> 29:50.020
And Tara was like, "Okay,
you have to order the drink."

29:50.022 --> 29:52.022
I'm like,
"I'm not doing that."

29:56.261 --> 29:57.995
And she didn't seem
to understand.

29:58.596 --> 30:00.130
So she just kind of got
mad at me.

30:00.132 --> 30:03.200
And I was like, "I'm not
[bleep] ordering this drink."

30:04.002 --> 30:05.268
<i>So she ordered it,</i>

30:05.270 --> 30:08.105
and then she's like, "Okay,
let's take a drink right here."

30:11.643 --> 30:17.214
I'm like, "How do you want me to take a
drink of an 86-ounce bucket with long straws

30:17.216 --> 30:20.184
<i>coming out of it when I
can't even see over the bar?"</i>

30:27.392 --> 30:31.929
And the fact that she's not understanding
that people are staring at me,

30:31.931 --> 30:35.799
she's not understanding that I'm
already in an uncomfortable situation,

30:35.801 --> 30:37.935
and her trying to push me
to do more...

30:37.969 --> 30:39.970
it just sets me off.

30:40.939 --> 30:45.275
Shauna does not like that I
am practical and realistic about

30:45.277 --> 30:51.615
her being so short and the
obstacles that she has to face.

30:51.617 --> 30:53.483
She hates it.

30:53.485 --> 30:58.155
I think she wants some
sympathy and I don't give it to her.

30:58.157 --> 31:02.426
And she gets frustrated
because of that.

31:02.428 --> 31:06.663
During the bachelorette weekend, I did
push Tara out of her comfort zone a lot,

31:06.665 --> 31:09.600
but at the bar, she kept trying
to do it right back a little bit

31:09.602 --> 31:11.735
when it came to the drinking
and the public stuff.

31:11.737 --> 31:14.671
I think Tara wanted
to include me in the fun,

31:14.673 --> 31:17.841
but I also don't think
she understands

31:17.843 --> 31:22.179
that I was extremely uncomfortable
at that bar because of the public

31:22.181 --> 31:26.049
and because of how many eyes
were on the little person drinking

31:26.051 --> 31:30.220
and it's just a very complicated
battle with her because of it.

31:40.832 --> 31:43.467
I just wanna have a good time.
I just wanna be left alone.

31:43.469 --> 31:46.703
I'm not bothering you, so
why do you have to bother me?

31:46.705 --> 31:50.073
I don't look you guys up and down, so
there's no reason to look me up and down.

31:55.947 --> 31:58.782
Tara and I do argue a lot,
but at the end of the day,

31:58.784 --> 32:01.018
we are sisters,
we're there for each other.

32:01.020 --> 32:03.053
And she's coming to town
again soon,

32:03.055 --> 32:04.388
so I don't wanna hold a grudge,

32:04.390 --> 32:07.357
I don't want her to hold a
grudge, so we just resolved [bleep].

32:11.896 --> 32:16.934
After we had drank that, like,
86-ounce thing, now I wanted to dance

32:16.936 --> 32:20.971
and I wasn't gonna let her dance
alone, so we went out on the dance floor.

32:29.580 --> 32:32.816
<i>Keely and Stephanie
also joined us, Tara did not.</i>

32:32.818 --> 32:36.653
Um, I don't know if anyone knows,
but her dance moves aren't good.

32:36.655 --> 32:39.022
- [laughs]
- But [laughs].

32:41.893 --> 32:45.796
It's nice letting loose
and acting like a 22-year-old

32:45.798 --> 32:49.666
and it's nice when I can
do that publicly and be free.

32:49.668 --> 32:52.169
<i>But sometimes
when I'm out in public,</i>

32:52.171 --> 32:54.738
<i>I'm uncomfortable
and not as confident,</i>

32:54.740 --> 32:56.940
<i>but everyone fakes
that confidence</i>

32:56.942 --> 32:58.475
until we make it,
and I do the same thing.

33:05.850 --> 33:10.220
Overall, I think the
bachelorette party was fine.

33:10.222 --> 33:11.955
I'll grade it on a B.

33:11.957 --> 33:15.092
Tomorrow, we're doing brunch.

33:15.094 --> 33:19.062
- We are doing brunch.
- With some very special guests.

33:29.173 --> 33:31.141
This morning,
we're going to brunch

33:31.143 --> 33:32.676
and I'm so excited.

33:32.678 --> 33:33.844
[all laughing]

33:33.846 --> 33:36.046
- You're like an old British woman.
- [laughing]

33:36.881 --> 33:39.583
- Yeah, it's so cute.
- Very nice.

33:39.585 --> 33:42.119
Brunch is exactly what I
wanted for my bachelorette party.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.820
- It was the only thing I wanted.
- Remember,

33:43.822 --> 33:45.489
you said you wanted it.

33:45.491 --> 33:47.157
- I wanted a brunch.
- Yup.

33:47.725 --> 33:48.992
Just a brunch.

33:49.961 --> 33:50.894
Shauna, are you getting a drink?

33:50.896 --> 33:54.297
There's an apple cider mimosa.

33:54.299 --> 33:58.101
We did a lot yesterday
and brunch was kind of early.

33:58.103 --> 34:01.238
<i>I'm not hungover,
I'm exhausted. We did a lot.</i>

34:01.240 --> 34:02.472
I'm fine.

34:02.840 --> 34:04.541
- I'd add--
- Yeah.

34:04.543 --> 34:06.643
<i>- Yeah.
- [Rylee] Can't drink, so I didn't wake up</i>

34:06.645 --> 34:07.911
- with a headache.
- She took a nap, took a bubble bath.

34:07.913 --> 34:11.148
She refreshed,
none of us got to refresh.

34:16.687 --> 34:21.391
All Tara ever wanted out of this
weekend was a nice peaceful brunch,

34:21.393 --> 34:24.227
so I'm gonna give her that,
but with a little twist.

34:27.065 --> 34:31.334
I hear there's a bride in town, is
that true? Who's getting married here?

34:44.048 --> 34:48.852
I hear there's a bride in town, is
that true? Who's getting married here?

34:48.854 --> 34:50.854
Wait, are you getting married?

34:50.856 --> 34:52.923
-Yeah.
-Who's getting married? You're getting married.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.991
- [Tara] I'm getting married.
- What is your name, baby?

34:54.993 --> 34:57.661
- My name's Tara.
- Tara, I'm Lola.

34:57.663 --> 35:00.764
- It's nice to meet you, my love.
- [Tara] Nice to meet you.

35:00.766 --> 35:04.868
<i>As soon as the drag queens came
in, I knew they were coming to my table</i>

35:04.870 --> 35:07.504
because y'all can't listen.

35:08.806 --> 35:10.207
I just wanted a brunch.

35:10.508 --> 35:11.775
You got a brunch.

35:11.777 --> 35:13.777
And y'all got
to make it something else.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.445
This is my friend Anna.

35:15.447 --> 35:19.816
- Hello.
- And we are here to make your day brighter,

35:19.818 --> 35:23.854
even brighter than it already is
with that bright smiling face of yours.

35:23.856 --> 35:25.288
So what's your fiance's name?

35:25.656 --> 35:27.190
- Jesse.
- [Lola] Jesse.

35:27.192 --> 35:29.593
- Yeah.
- Well, can I see a picture of Jesse, please?

35:29.595 --> 35:30.994
- Are you from Pittsburgh?
- Yes.

35:30.996 --> 35:33.296
- We're from Pittsburgh.
- Ooh, both of you from Pittsburgh.

35:33.298 --> 35:35.098
- Yeah.
- We're all...

35:35.100 --> 35:36.800
- That's Jesse.
- Yup.

35:36.802 --> 35:37.901
Ooh, that's Jesse.

35:37.903 --> 35:41.271
-[Anna] Mmm-hmm.
-Ooh, it's Jesse. I like Jesse.

35:41.273 --> 35:44.908
Well, you take a few bites and
then we're gonna play a game.

35:44.910 --> 35:46.042
- Is that okay with you?
- Okay.

35:46.044 --> 35:47.377
[Lola] Okay?

35:47.379 --> 35:51.615
Jesse answered a bunch
of questions about you two.

35:51.617 --> 35:55.519
And now we're going to see if you
can answer those questions as well

35:55.521 --> 35:57.921
- and give us the same answers as Jesse does.
- I'm going to get a divorce

35:57.923 --> 36:00.223
- before I even get married.
- Divorce,

36:00.225 --> 36:03.660
divorce before the wedding, you
know, there's a first time for everything.

36:03.662 --> 36:05.829
Cheers.

36:05.831 --> 36:08.932
Questions are pretty much
general relationship stuff.

36:08.934 --> 36:12.502
So I feel, like, if you can't
get these questions correct,

36:12.504 --> 36:14.938
you probably don't know
your significant other that well.

36:14.940 --> 36:17.040
- [Lola] Question number one.
- [laughs] Oh, no.

36:17.042 --> 36:19.242
Where was your first kiss?

36:20.545 --> 36:23.113
- [Tara] Oh, [bleep].
- Uh-huh.

36:23.115 --> 36:26.116
You don't know this,
but it was in his basement.

36:26.118 --> 36:27.083
You were in his basement?

36:27.085 --> 36:28.585
This is not what he said?

36:28.587 --> 36:30.687
- No. He said in a park.
- [Tara] He's wrong.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.390
Oh, that was our first date,
but I did not kiss him there.

36:33.392 --> 36:35.258
- You didn't kiss him there.
- [Tara] No.

36:35.260 --> 36:38.261
- It must be some other girl.
- [Shauna] No, listen, she's a liar.

36:38.263 --> 36:40.130
[all laughing]

36:40.132 --> 36:41.932
He's wrong.

36:41.934 --> 36:43.233
Our first kiss
was not at the park.

36:43.235 --> 36:45.168
- [laughs]
- It wasn't.

36:45.170 --> 36:47.270
Where was our first kiss?

36:47.272 --> 36:49.105
Our first kiss
was in my basement.

36:49.173 --> 36:50.840
I was right.

36:50.842 --> 36:54.878
What is Jesse's favorite
body part of yours?

36:54.880 --> 36:57.414
- Of my body?
- [Lola] Mmm-hmm.

36:57.416 --> 36:59.182
Why is he marrying you?

36:59.184 --> 37:02.152
Not because of your bright, shining
personality, but because of your?

37:02.154 --> 37:03.353
[all laughing]

37:03.988 --> 37:05.789
[Tara] My eyes.

37:05.791 --> 37:06.890
[all laughing]

37:06.892 --> 37:10.594
No! Your fiance said your ass.

37:10.596 --> 37:12.262
- Yes!
- [all laughing]

37:14.031 --> 37:16.066
I thought it was gonna
be your butt, too.

37:16.068 --> 37:19.869
Okay, so number six,
what would Tara say

37:19.871 --> 37:22.973
- is her favorite body part of Jesse's?
- Oh, no.

37:23.941 --> 37:25.875
He said your booty,
so where you going with this?

37:25.877 --> 37:27.310
Nope, not there.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.712
[Lola] Uh-uh, not there.

37:28.714 --> 37:30.113
[Tara] His face.

37:30.115 --> 37:32.148
Can I say that?
Is that a body part?

37:32.150 --> 37:32.882
[all laughing]

37:32.884 --> 37:36.086
He said his arms.

37:36.088 --> 37:37.554
- [Tara] Oh.
- [Shauna] Do you like his arms?

37:37.556 --> 37:40.323
- I like his arms.
- Do what? She said do you like his arms?

37:40.325 --> 37:42.025
- [Tara] That might be the best answer.
- [Lola] Are y'all sisters?

37:42.027 --> 37:44.728
Oh, the...
We're sisters with her.

37:44.730 --> 37:46.796
Oh, my... I was looked at her
and I was like,

37:46.798 --> 37:50.233
that face, her face,
and your face, y'all sisters.

37:50.235 --> 37:52.168
So, um, are you gay?

37:52.170 --> 37:54.137
- I'm bi.
- A bi, yes!

37:54.139 --> 37:55.305
[all laughing]

37:56.707 --> 37:57.807
[Rylee] I'm bi.

37:57.809 --> 38:01.878
Um, when I was little,
um, my parents used to ask me,

38:01.880 --> 38:04.914
like, in kindergarten,
if I had a boyfriend.

38:04.916 --> 38:07.784
I would ask them why
couldn't I have a girlfriend

38:07.786 --> 38:09.853
'cause I didn't see
a difference in people.

38:09.855 --> 38:15.825
I came out
when I was in seventh grade.

38:15.827 --> 38:18.662
And it was
a very awkward conversations.

38:18.664 --> 38:21.197
Our parents say
that they didn't yell at me,

38:21.199 --> 38:23.633
Shauna says that they do,
I say that they do.

38:23.635 --> 38:29.139
Shauna defended the crap out of
me and I owe her a lot because of it.

38:29.141 --> 38:31.474
Now I have a giant pride flag
in my room and they just go,

38:31.476 --> 38:34.110
"Go full, just be lesbian,
why don't ya?"

38:34.112 --> 38:37.113
I'm like, "That's not how it works,"
and now they're overly supportive, so.

38:37.682 --> 38:39.315
It's fine now.

38:39.317 --> 38:43.753
She was the one that fought for me, like,
when I came out to my parents and stuff.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.855
- What's your name, babe?
- Shauna.

38:45.857 --> 38:49.959
- Shauna, Shauna, you're my favorite.
- Thank you. [laughs]

38:49.961 --> 38:56.466
When Rylee came out to me,
she was just so uncomfortable

38:56.468 --> 38:59.903
because she thought our
parents were gonna say something

38:59.905 --> 39:03.640
or not fully understand 'cause
they're just from a different era.

39:03.642 --> 39:06.376
And I think having me
in her corner

39:06.378 --> 39:08.645
and being fully supportive
really helped her.

39:08.647 --> 39:12.515
And I had to explain to them that no
matter what they had to be there for her.

39:12.517 --> 39:16.953
I'm getting drunk today based off
this table and, uh, I'm fine with it.

39:16.955 --> 39:21.191
Shauna and I are gonna go and
sit at that bar and just get crunk.

39:21.193 --> 39:22.726
- Shauna.
- I'm here till Monday, so.

39:22.728 --> 39:24.828
[all laughing]

39:24.830 --> 39:29.032
As drag queens, a lot of the time,
we are judged by how we look.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.502
So it's very similar
to be a drag queen

39:32.504 --> 39:35.038
and have someone
look down on you,

39:35.040 --> 39:38.975
as it is, way different but
similar, looking upon Shauna

39:38.977 --> 39:40.744
<i>as a little person and
having an initial judgement</i>

39:40.746 --> 39:43.146
<i>that she's not
like the rest of us.</i>

39:43.148 --> 39:46.116
<i>Because I will tell you
something, meeting Shauna today,</i>

39:46.118 --> 39:48.752
if I had to put myself
up against Shauna

39:48.754 --> 39:51.421
in any kind of titty talk,
she'd win.

39:51.423 --> 39:56.192
She's 22 years old and she is
basically like David and Goliath.

39:56.194 --> 39:59.162
She's a little person,
but she's Goliath.

39:59.164 --> 40:00.697
She's gonna kick your ass.

40:00.699 --> 40:02.132
Sorry, girl.

40:02.134 --> 40:06.803
All right, I need to know exactly
how many questions you got right

40:06.805 --> 40:10.340
and how many questions
you got wrong.

40:10.342 --> 40:14.077
Out of 22 questions,
she got 14 right.

40:14.079 --> 40:15.211
[Lola] Ooh.

40:15.213 --> 40:17.480
- 14 out of 22?
- Not great.

40:17.482 --> 40:20.083
You failed.

40:20.085 --> 40:22.419
You have the best bridal table
right here and I'm so happy.

40:22.421 --> 40:24.187
- Aw.
- [Lola] You have the best sisters.

40:24.189 --> 40:27.090
- [Tara] Yeah.
- I'm so happy to be here today and I'm so happy

40:27.092 --> 40:30.160
that I have a little part,
we have a little part

40:30.162 --> 40:32.796
in your special time
on your special day,

40:32.798 --> 40:34.297
- so thank you so much.
- Thank you.

40:34.299 --> 40:36.132
- I want a big old hug from you.
- Okay.

40:36.634 --> 40:37.734
[both] Aw.

40:37.736 --> 40:41.237
The bachelorette weekend
wasn't as bad as I expected.

40:41.239 --> 40:44.307
There was still a little
raunch, let me tell you.

40:44.309 --> 40:46.876
But, that is to be expected,

40:46.878 --> 40:51.047
and I did enjoy getting
to spend a weekend

40:51.049 --> 40:54.484
with my sisters and
my friends, so I'll take it.

40:54.486 --> 40:56.953
See you at the wedding.
I'm doing your makeup.

40:56.955 --> 41:00.223
- You're gonna look great.
- You look good, so you can do my makeup, yes.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.926
- Y'all have a wonderful day now.
- Bye.

41:02.928 --> 41:05.128
Bye, see you soon.

41:06.597 --> 41:09.232
<i>[Shauna] Next time
on I Am Shauna Rae.</i>

41:09.234 --> 41:14.003
Tara's in town for Halloween, so tonight we're
having dinner with the whole family at home.

41:14.005 --> 41:16.673
-You want butter? Which one you want?
-Whatever.

41:16.675 --> 41:18.875
When I tell my parents
that I'm moving out,

41:18.877 --> 41:20.777
I don't think
it'll go over well.

41:20.779 --> 41:24.781
So what do y'all think
about me moving out?

41:24.783 --> 41:29.085
What is your timeline for
wanting all of this to happen?

41:29.087 --> 41:30.520
- Six months.
- What?

41:30.522 --> 41:31.888
- [all] Whoa!
- [coughs]

41:31.890 --> 41:36.092
Realistically, Shauna's 22,
she should be out of my house,

41:36.094 --> 41:40.063
but she just can't
move anywhere.

41:42.800 --> 41:44.901
What kind of costumes
were you last year?

41:44.903 --> 41:47.570
I don't do trick or treating,
I'm 22.

41:47.572 --> 41:49.138
- You're 22?
- Yeah.

41:49.140 --> 41:52.642
I absolutely love Halloween.
It's my favorite holiday.

41:52.644 --> 41:55.645
- [laughs] - But dressing
up for Halloween

41:55.647 --> 41:59.082
is something I dread, it's
something that's very complicated

41:59.084 --> 42:02.118
because age appropriate
outfits, they don't fit.

42:02.120 --> 42:02.819
- [thuds]
- Ow!

42:02.821 --> 42:04.320
Aw.

42:05.856 --> 42:07.490
My family is concerned
with how much

42:07.492 --> 42:11.494
I'm having these migraines because
they do start where the tumor was

42:11.496 --> 42:13.963
<i>and from the first time
I had one of these migraines,</i>

42:13.965 --> 42:16.499
I thought I had cancer again.

42:16.501 --> 42:19.135
Today I'm going to see a
neurologist for my migraines.

42:19.137 --> 42:20.503
What's wrong?

42:20.505 --> 42:23.139
I don't care for a neurologist.

42:23.141 --> 42:27.310
It definitely worries me that
this could be something more.
