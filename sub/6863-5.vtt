WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:02.602
Zoe, I love you, but I don't
even know if I can write here.

00:02.670 --> 00:04.971
You're gonna fall in
love with BlueBell.

00:05.039 --> 00:06.274
I don't have any
interest in being part

00:06.340 --> 00:07.741
of an organization
that would ask me

00:07.808 --> 00:09.510
to remove gum
from the sidewalk.

00:09.577 --> 00:11.879
There is this girl, Zoe.
Zoe Hart? I love her.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.547
I called off my wedding for her.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.949
Then I found out I was too late,
'cause she slept with Wade.

00:16.015 --> 00:17.418
Luckily, the solution is simple.

00:17.485 --> 00:18.852
Write a song
about your pain.

00:18.919 --> 00:20.654
I'm Lemon Breeland.
I go by Peter.

00:20.721 --> 00:22.556
Aren't you gonna
miss your flight?
It can wait a couple more hours.

00:22.623 --> 00:23.957
GEORGE:
 We are not going
 to get together.

00:24.024 --> 00:26.294
Lavon would break my kneecaps.

00:26.360 --> 00:28.162
(screaming)
ZOE:
George?

00:28.229 --> 00:29.697
I need a doctor,
and it can't be Brick.

00:31.499 --> 00:34.435
George! Hey!

00:34.502 --> 00:36.437
Just the guy
I'm looking for.

00:36.504 --> 00:39.107
I have something for you.

00:39.173 --> 00:41.709
Nope. No, thank you.

00:41.775 --> 00:43.844
Well, try it.

00:43.911 --> 00:47.047
It's whitefish salad
from Russ & Daughters!
No!

00:47.115 --> 00:49.016
No, thank you.

00:49.083 --> 00:51.051
You know, it was a
gesture, just to say

00:51.119 --> 00:52.753
that we have put
everything behind us,

00:52.820 --> 00:53.887
and that we're friends now.

00:53.954 --> 00:55.223
(laughs)

00:55.289 --> 00:57.725
No, we are not friends.

00:57.791 --> 00:59.560
Incorrect. We are friends.

00:59.627 --> 01:02.062
Remember the other week,
when I fixed your hand,

01:02.130 --> 01:04.098
I sewed you up,
and we chatted?

01:04.165 --> 01:08.369
There was bonding, repair,
bridges once crumbled, rebuilt.

01:09.370 --> 01:11.539
I called you out of desperation.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.141
Fine.

01:13.207 --> 01:16.277
Next time you get an appendage
stuck in some girl's zipper,

01:16.344 --> 01:17.778
have Brick deal with it.

01:17.845 --> 01:20.548
He will not be as gentle as I.

01:24.418 --> 01:28.956
Wade, my old pal, as you may
surmise, I will have my usual.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.858
Meat Lover's Omelet--
hold the meat, hold the yolks,

01:30.924 --> 01:32.660
hold the potatoes,
don't butter the toast.

01:32.726 --> 01:34.027
Got it.

01:34.094 --> 01:35.429
Doc, can I get you anything?

01:35.496 --> 01:37.097
I'm on my way to the office.
Just a coffee to go.

01:37.165 --> 01:38.432
Will do.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.502
What are we smiling at?

01:41.569 --> 01:43.036
Just, I've never had a usual.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.105
I really like it.

01:45.173 --> 01:47.040
I'm settling
into a nice routine here.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.943
You know, I-I write
in the morning, I have lunch,

01:50.010 --> 01:51.612
take a taxi over
to Gulf Shores

01:51.679 --> 01:53.247
to get my double
caramel Macchiato.

01:53.314 --> 01:55.383
Maybe it's time to
learn how to drive.

01:55.449 --> 01:57.084
No way.
I'm the only person

01:57.151 --> 01:58.652
keeping Yellow Cab Company
in business.

01:58.719 --> 02:01.121
Well, you and BlueBell
seem to be hitting it off.

02:01.189 --> 02:04.325
I'd say
our future is very promising.

02:05.526 --> 02:09.197
Oh, now, my dear, go save lives.

02:09.263 --> 02:11.465
I have a book to write.

02:20.841 --> 02:24.144
My short story takes place
in London.

02:24.212 --> 02:26.880
This helps set the mood.

02:26.947 --> 02:28.081
Oh.

02:28.148 --> 02:30.318
Oh.

02:30.384 --> 02:33.020
Is he gonna camp
out there all day

02:33.086 --> 02:34.388
hogging the
only outlet?

02:34.455 --> 02:35.489
'Cause Frank's
gonna have a cow.

02:35.556 --> 02:36.557
Shut up!

02:36.624 --> 02:38.292
Joel-- he's doing good.
You know, he has

02:38.359 --> 02:40.160
a place to write,
he has friends.

02:40.228 --> 02:43.697
And it's all thanks
to my acclimation program.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.098
(women laughing)

02:45.165 --> 02:47.935
Hey, ladies,
some good gossip?

02:48.001 --> 02:50.304
Oh, it's nothing.

02:50.371 --> 02:52.105
Just Dash's weekly poll.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.309
You know: Should we get a
traffic light? Who wore it best?

02:55.376 --> 02:56.977
WADE: Oh, turns out it was Delma
at Bingo night.

02:57.044 --> 03:00.180
58% thinks we should do
 Oklahoma as the town musical,

03:00.248 --> 03:02.316
42% think that the Rammer Jammer

03:02.383 --> 03:04.685
should have soft serve,
and 13% thinks

03:04.752 --> 03:06.720
Joel is the right guy
for Zoe Hart.

03:06.787 --> 03:09.557
Hey, 13%!
Ain't half bad.

03:09.623 --> 03:11.992
You! Are you somehow
behind this?

03:12.059 --> 03:14.061
Dash's blog poll?

03:14.127 --> 03:15.596
Yeah, caught me red-handed.

03:15.663 --> 03:17.598
See, I took a computer class,
learned hacking,

03:17.665 --> 03:19.333
and I made it
into the mainframe.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.469
It was pretty tough,
but I did it.

03:22.403 --> 03:23.604
No, I did not.

03:23.671 --> 03:25.539
Matter of fact, I voted yes.

03:25.606 --> 03:27.241
Well, I don't get it.

03:27.308 --> 03:29.510
You know, how could they not
think that he's right for me?

03:29.577 --> 03:30.844
Don't they like him?

03:30.911 --> 03:32.880
What's not to like?

03:46.093 --> 03:47.094
(jet engines whooshing)

03:47.160 --> 03:49.096
(seagulls calling)

03:49.162 --> 03:51.432
(birds singing)

03:58.839 --> 04:02.042
Something I can help you with,
ladies?

04:02.109 --> 04:05.012
Not a thing.
Just discussing Belle business.

04:05.078 --> 04:06.480
With an actual Belle.
Mm.

04:06.547 --> 04:08.849
ELODIE: And how you stood up
Tanner Hughes at

04:08.916 --> 04:10.451
the Halloween Masquerade.

04:10.518 --> 04:12.453
And the possibility that
you just may be mentally ill.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.588
Okay, well, thank you
for your concern,

04:14.655 --> 04:16.957
but I ended my date
with Tanner early

04:17.024 --> 04:18.358
because I met someone better.

04:18.426 --> 04:20.827
His name is Peter,
and he's a news producer.

04:20.894 --> 04:22.763
So, where is he?

04:22.830 --> 04:25.799
Well, he had to leave the next
day on an extended assignment

04:25.866 --> 04:27.968
to Scotland, and then
he's off to Vancouver.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.603
Oh, Lemon, dear,

04:29.670 --> 04:32.606
you literally have a figurative
boyfriend in Canada.

04:32.673 --> 04:35.042
Well, he's not my boyfriend,
and I assure you,

04:35.108 --> 04:38.879
he is very charming,
very handsome and very real.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.414
This is my in.

04:40.481 --> 04:41.882
Lemon's making up

04:41.949 --> 04:43.183
fake boyfriends.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.552
If she's desperate enough
to do that,

04:44.618 --> 04:46.086
she's desperate enough
to take me back!

04:46.153 --> 04:47.955
I thought you said
you were done with her.

04:48.021 --> 04:51.392
As long as she's so pretty
and I'm so... me,

04:51.459 --> 04:53.394
"done" is a four-letter word.

04:53.461 --> 04:55.028
Morning, Lemon.
Ah.

04:55.095 --> 04:57.297
Ladies, fortifying ourselves
for the big day, I see.

04:57.365 --> 04:58.932
Our gazebo made

04:58.999 --> 05:01.268
the Gazebos of Alabama Calendar
for the first time.

05:01.335 --> 05:03.270
We're February.
Congratulations, Lavon.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.439
Competition
for that is fierce.

05:05.506 --> 05:07.508
Yeah. Well, I'm not content
with just February.

05:07.575 --> 05:08.909
You know, shortest
month of the year.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.444
I want the cover.

05:10.511 --> 05:11.779
Well, don't you worry, Lavon.

05:11.845 --> 05:13.113
The Belles will not
let you down.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.448
We are off
to make that gazebo

05:14.515 --> 05:16.249
look like St. Valentine himself.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.985
If he were made of 4,000

05:18.051 --> 05:19.820
pink roses.

05:26.394 --> 05:28.161
Are you crazy, Lavon?

05:28.228 --> 05:30.798
Putting Crickett in charge of a
major public relations project?

05:30.864 --> 05:33.200
Well-well, the gazebo falls
under Belle jurisdiction.

05:33.266 --> 05:34.935
Wait, look, I-I know

05:35.002 --> 05:38.472
you left them ladies behind, but
you think you might help out?

05:38.539 --> 05:39.973
Just this once?

05:40.040 --> 05:43.210
Nope. I'm sorry, Lavon.

05:43.276 --> 05:45.413
Good luck to you.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.717
(sighs)

05:52.019 --> 05:53.787
(clearing her throat)

05:53.854 --> 05:56.990
Are you aware that 87%
of people in this town

05:57.057 --> 05:58.892
don't think Joel and I
should belong together?

05:58.959 --> 06:00.961
What?
Have you not read
Dash's poll?

06:01.028 --> 06:02.730
Well, I-I read
about the soft serve.

06:02.796 --> 06:04.364
It was right after
the soft serve!

06:04.432 --> 06:06.366
Yeah, I'm a single-issue
voter, so...

06:06.434 --> 06:08.502
Come on. You know, it's obvious.

06:08.569 --> 06:09.937
They don't like Joel.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.972
You didn't either,
until a few days ago.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.474
Well, that is true.

06:13.541 --> 06:15.008
My God, it's all my fault.

06:15.075 --> 06:17.511
You know, I've been so busy
selling Joel on BlueBell,

06:17.578 --> 06:19.980
that I've neglected
to sell BlueBell on Joel!

06:20.047 --> 06:21.649
Why do you care so much?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.784
Because these are my people,
you know?

06:23.851 --> 06:25.318
I want them to root for us!

06:25.385 --> 06:26.554
Oh, give it time, Zoe.

06:26.620 --> 06:28.088
Joel is an acquired taste.

06:28.155 --> 06:29.523
Just like you.

06:29.590 --> 06:31.525
Yeah, and it stunk
when I didn't fit in.

06:31.592 --> 06:34.928
We need to make him popular,
pronto.

06:34.995 --> 06:37.130
You know what would help?
Mm.

06:37.197 --> 06:41.401
An endorsement
from an esteemed public figure.

06:41.469 --> 06:43.871
You want me
to issue a mayoral decree

06:43.937 --> 06:46.006
that all people
like your boyfriend?

06:46.073 --> 06:47.508
Yes.

06:47.575 --> 06:49.209
Come on, you're supposed
to be my best friend.

06:49.276 --> 06:51.612
Yeah, and I forgot
how exhausting it could be.

06:51.679 --> 06:55.449
Fine. I will take care
of this myself.

06:57.485 --> 07:02.422
No, no, no, no...

07:02.490 --> 07:04.925
Thank you so much, Mrs. Gorey.
Good to see you.

07:04.992 --> 07:07.227
Good morning, George.
(gasps)

07:07.294 --> 07:10.297
Lynly? You're... you're back?

07:10.363 --> 07:11.965
Came in last night.
Great.

07:12.032 --> 07:14.434
That is... that is great,
and now you're in my...

07:14.502 --> 07:16.169
you're in my office.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.506
Uh, please tell me you have
something on under that coat.

07:18.572 --> 07:21.775
I totally deserve that.
(anxious laugh)

07:21.842 --> 07:24.044
How's your finger?
Uh, it...

07:24.111 --> 07:25.513
It is better.

07:25.579 --> 07:26.580
It's back to normal, actually.
It can point

07:26.647 --> 07:28.081
to the exit.
You see that?

07:28.148 --> 07:30.183
I took a practice LSAT
while I was in Texas.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.451
Did pretty well.

07:31.519 --> 07:33.587
So, despite the
fact that I was

07:33.654 --> 07:35.255
mainly trying to seduce you,

07:35.322 --> 07:38.458
guess some of the stuff
you were teaching me sunk in.

07:38.526 --> 07:41.695
So, I got you this.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.396
That's-that's not gonna explode
or anything?

07:43.463 --> 07:44.765
(wry laugh) No.

07:44.832 --> 07:47.601
It's a biography of
Thurgood Marshall.

07:47.668 --> 07:49.369
Please consider it

07:49.436 --> 07:53.473
a very small token
of my very humongous apology.

07:53.541 --> 07:56.009
Thank you.

07:56.076 --> 07:57.377
And don't worry.

07:57.444 --> 07:59.680
I'll stay out of your way
from now on.

07:59.747 --> 08:02.249
Good-bye, George Tucker.

08:05.085 --> 08:07.821
I don't want to learn
how to drive a car.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.023
As an environmentalist,
I'm worried about emissions.

08:10.090 --> 08:12.860
As a New Yorker, I'm worried
about driving a car.

08:12.926 --> 08:14.628
Everyone in BlueBell drives.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.496
How else are you going to get
to your movies in Mobile?

08:16.564 --> 08:18.766
Or the fishing hole in Daphne?

08:18.832 --> 08:21.234
I saw every movie in
Mobile three years ago.

08:21.301 --> 08:23.370
And I don't fish.
Well...

08:23.436 --> 08:26.774
no better time
than now to start.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.375
I bet you're gonna love it.

08:28.441 --> 08:31.645
Also, I got you this

08:31.712 --> 08:35.381
to keep your eyes out of the sun
while you're doing it.

08:35.448 --> 08:38.652
I... wh...

08:38.719 --> 08:40.287
What is going on with you?

08:40.352 --> 08:43.756
I want us to be more integral
to our community, you know?

08:43.823 --> 08:47.060
And... and if,
in doing so, we are

08:47.127 --> 08:50.764
embraced by an acceptable
66% of it, great.

08:50.831 --> 08:54.134
You know? Ten and two,
start the car.

08:54.201 --> 08:56.804
No, I... no.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.706
Zoe. Zoe, turn this car off.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.408
Just put your foot on the gas.
I'm not putting my
foot on the gas.

09:01.474 --> 09:02.676
Push down on the gas.
I am not...

09:02.743 --> 09:04.111
Push down on the gas!

09:04.177 --> 09:05.145
I'm not putting
my foot down!
Push it!

09:05.212 --> 09:07.014
(engine revving)

09:07.080 --> 09:08.348
(thudding)

09:08.415 --> 09:09.650
(gasps)

09:13.854 --> 09:16.523
Good heavens!
Did you all not
see me right here?

09:16.590 --> 09:17.691
Oh, I see stars.

09:17.758 --> 09:19.426
ZOE:
Oh, my God, Reverend.

09:19.492 --> 09:21.128
So sorry.
Aah.
Are you okay?

09:21.194 --> 09:22.395
Breaking news, BlueBell.

09:22.462 --> 09:27.935
Zoe's new beau just rear-ended
our revered Reverend.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.703
This man just can't
catch a break.

09:29.770 --> 09:31.705
Or seem to find one.

09:38.979 --> 09:40.380
Reverend Mayfair, don't blame
Joel-- it's all my fault.

09:40.447 --> 09:42.850
I don't know if you saw
the Blawker's weekly poll,

09:42.916 --> 09:45.853
but only 13% of the people think
that I should be with him.

09:45.919 --> 09:48.088
And I'm sure the number's even
less after hitting you.

09:48.155 --> 09:50.023
I was just trying
to help him out.

09:50.090 --> 09:52.359
Zoe, please--
accidents happen.

09:52.425 --> 09:54.795
I don't blame Joel.
He's new; he's learning.

09:54.862 --> 09:56.664
He seems like an
outstanding fella.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.298
I'm glad you met him.

09:58.365 --> 09:59.466
He is!

09:59.532 --> 10:00.901
You know...

10:00.968 --> 10:03.671
if only the whole town
could see that, too.

10:03.737 --> 10:05.873
Hey, you know what?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.074
You have

10:07.140 --> 10:09.743
the entire town's ears
every Sunday.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.411
I have a great idea.

10:11.478 --> 10:13.947
What if this Sunday, you preach
a "Love Thy Neighbor"?

10:14.014 --> 10:15.482
Thy new neighbor?

10:15.548 --> 10:19.619
Zoe, uh, I am not the
all-request DJ at WWJD.

10:19.687 --> 10:21.789
I already have my
sermon all set to go.

10:21.855 --> 10:25.292
My in-laws are in town,
the wife is on edge

10:25.358 --> 10:27.227
because we are
sleep-training the twins.

10:27.294 --> 10:29.296
I barely have time
to eat my dinner,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.298
much less rewrite my sermon.

10:31.364 --> 10:32.700
I know what you need:

10:32.766 --> 10:34.167
Some R & R.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.202
Doctor's orders.

10:35.268 --> 10:36.837
And then wake up
in the morning,

10:36.904 --> 10:38.171
write your new sermon

10:38.238 --> 10:39.506
with fresh eyes.

10:39.572 --> 10:41.809
Lovely as that sounds,
Beverly's parents are here

10:41.875 --> 10:43.844
because I have the Tween
Adventure Camp tomorrow.

10:43.911 --> 10:46.814
24 hours of zip-lining, hiking

10:46.880 --> 10:49.349
and communing with nature
slash the Lord.

10:49.416 --> 10:52.720
Well, what if Joel and I
led the camping trip?

10:52.786 --> 10:53.854
I am a great zip-liner.

10:53.921 --> 10:55.689
Mmm...
No, I am.

10:55.756 --> 10:56.990
I have zip-lined

10:57.057 --> 10:59.059
at Club Meds
on three continents!

10:59.126 --> 11:00.193
And Joel?

11:00.260 --> 11:01.729
Half of his book

11:01.795 --> 11:03.330
takes place in the wilderness.

11:03.396 --> 11:04.631
He'll be great.

11:04.698 --> 11:06.867
Well, it would be lovely
to get away

11:06.934 --> 11:08.635
just for a night, alone,

11:08.702 --> 11:11.338
me and the missus, no kids.

11:11.404 --> 11:12.605
(inhales)

11:12.672 --> 11:15.275
All right. I'm in.

11:15.342 --> 11:16.609
Mazel tov.

11:16.676 --> 11:18.145
Hallelujah.
(chuckles)

11:19.146 --> 11:20.848
Ow.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.115
Hey, Lemon.
What's up?

11:22.182 --> 11:23.751
These are for you.
(chuckles)

11:23.817 --> 11:25.418
Meatball, we've
been through this.

11:25.485 --> 11:27.054
Right. Of course.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.456
You'd rather be
with an imaginary guy
from Canada than me.

11:29.522 --> 11:30.924
Peter?

11:30.991 --> 11:33.994
Even the name's
not realistic.

11:35.395 --> 11:36.964
Elodie and I checked
the guest list

11:37.030 --> 11:38.766
for the masquerade party
last week.

11:38.832 --> 11:41.034
No sign of any Peter.

11:41.101 --> 11:43.503
That is because he used
his boss's invitation.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.038
I'm sure
he did, dear.

11:45.105 --> 11:47.707
First you told people you were
dating Wade, then Peter.

11:47.775 --> 11:50.577
Who's next, Santa Claus?

11:50.643 --> 11:53.646
Okay, you know, I don't know
if you ladies know this,

11:53.713 --> 11:55.048
but that lovely vine you planted

11:55.115 --> 11:57.184
back there is kudzu.
By tomorrow morning,

11:57.250 --> 11:58.752
it will have strangled
your entire garden.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.520
So... good luck to you.

12:00.587 --> 12:02.790
Kudzu? Kudzu?!

12:02.856 --> 12:04.391
This never
would've happened

12:04.457 --> 12:05.658
under Lemon's reign.

12:05.725 --> 12:07.594
Right, ladies?

12:07.660 --> 12:10.063
Well... we'll just
clear it out then.

12:10.130 --> 12:11.664
(chuckles)
Clear it out.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.935
Yeah. Just clear it out!

12:15.002 --> 12:16.669
Dig! Dig, dig,

12:16.736 --> 12:17.537
dig, dig, dig!

12:17.604 --> 12:18.738
(pants)

12:18.806 --> 12:20.908
Faster!
(laughs nervously)

12:20.974 --> 12:22.242
WALLY:
All right, folks,

12:22.309 --> 12:23.911
tonight's pub quiz
is a close one.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.145
Shula and Cody

12:25.212 --> 12:26.814
are in the lead.
George and Tom,

12:26.880 --> 12:27.915
one point behind.

12:27.981 --> 12:30.417
Our next question:

12:30.483 --> 12:31.819
How long...

12:31.885 --> 12:33.686
did the Hundred Year War last?

12:33.753 --> 12:34.387
(bell dings)

12:34.454 --> 12:35.422
116 years.

12:35.488 --> 12:36.423
Correct!

12:36.489 --> 12:37.424
(grunts)
Boom!

12:37.490 --> 12:38.691
In your face,

12:38.758 --> 12:39.960
Shula!
Oh...

12:40.027 --> 12:41.962
Ah. Ooh.
(grunts)

12:42.029 --> 12:44.364
Tom, sweetie, Lemon said
I could leave early.

12:44.431 --> 12:46.967
But George and I are
about to take the lead.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.437
Yes, but it's Friday night.

12:50.503 --> 12:51.972
Aw. Oh...

12:52.039 --> 12:53.673
I have to go.
It's Friday night.

12:53.740 --> 12:55.442
That's-that's fine.
That's fine. I can go home.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.911
No, no, no-- Team Long/Tucker
is tied for first.

12:57.978 --> 12:59.712
Dang it. Wait.
It's...

12:59.779 --> 13:01.148
Tom, really, it's no big deal.

13:01.214 --> 13:02.983
You don't have to...
What are you doing?

13:03.050 --> 13:05.118
Here?
Wally, I am invoking

13:05.185 --> 13:07.855
rule number 24,
replacement teammate.

13:07.921 --> 13:09.189
(quietly):
I saw her

13:09.256 --> 13:11.624
mouthing answers over there.
She's real good.

13:11.691 --> 13:15.128
Uh... I can go.
Hey, you don't have
to stay if you don't...

13:15.195 --> 13:19.867
WALLY: Our next question is
for you oceanography buffs.

13:19.933 --> 13:22.469
What is the deepest part
of the ocean?

13:25.372 --> 13:26.606
You know it?

13:26.673 --> 13:27.474
Go ahead.

13:27.540 --> 13:28.375
(bell dings)

13:28.441 --> 13:29.442
The Mariana Trench.

13:29.509 --> 13:30.277
Correct!

13:30.343 --> 13:31.711
(crowd cheering)

13:31.778 --> 13:34.481
And now George
and his new partner Lynly

13:34.547 --> 13:36.449
take the lead.
Oh, man!

13:36.516 --> 13:37.450
I knew that one.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.519
Sure you did, dummy.

13:39.586 --> 13:42.722
You keep answering questions
like that, you can stick around.

13:42.789 --> 13:43.590
Really?

13:43.656 --> 13:44.691
Yeah. Just...

13:44.757 --> 13:45.725
stay on your side of the barrel.

13:45.792 --> 13:46.960
Okay?
(chuckles)

13:51.298 --> 13:52.032
Hi, Lavon.

13:52.099 --> 13:53.500
What are you doing here?

13:53.566 --> 13:55.635
Well, I'm here to ask you--
uh, to beg you, really--

13:55.702 --> 13:58.205
would you please reconsider
helping out with the gazebo?

13:58.271 --> 14:00.173
I mean, Crickett has completely
cracked under pressure.

14:00.240 --> 14:02.442
And I need this,
uh, we need this

14:02.509 --> 14:03.643
to go well.

14:03.710 --> 14:05.112
For BlueBell's dignity.

14:08.315 --> 14:09.716
Okay.

14:09.782 --> 14:11.451
Yes, I'm in.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.185
You are?

14:12.252 --> 14:13.020
Yes.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.988
(chuckles)
But...

14:15.055 --> 14:16.990
in return, I need you
to help me prove

14:17.057 --> 14:19.092
that the man that I met
at the masquerade party

14:19.159 --> 14:20.627
the other day exists.

14:20.693 --> 14:22.029
His name's Peter.

14:22.095 --> 14:23.663
Yeah, o-okay.

14:23.730 --> 14:25.465
Uh, what's his last name?

14:25.532 --> 14:27.800
That's the thing...
(chuckles)

14:27.867 --> 14:29.202
I don't know.

14:29.269 --> 14:31.471
Wow, okay, well,
not a lot to work with.

14:31.538 --> 14:34.274
Uh, but don't worry, Lemon,
we will find your man.

14:34.341 --> 14:35.375
(chuckles)

14:35.442 --> 14:35.943
Deal?

14:36.009 --> 14:37.544
Deal.

14:37.610 --> 14:39.212
All right.
(chuckles)

14:39.279 --> 14:40.347
Correct!

14:40.413 --> 14:43.917
And our winners tonight
are George Tucker

14:43.984 --> 14:45.218
and Lynly Hayes.

14:45.285 --> 14:47.020
Give 'em a hand,
y'all!
Yes!

14:47.087 --> 14:48.655
We trounced the competition.

14:48.721 --> 14:49.789
More like destroyed.

14:49.856 --> 14:51.158
Demolished. Obliterated.

14:51.224 --> 14:53.226
Extirpated.
Extirpated?

14:53.293 --> 14:54.561
To pull up from the roots.

14:54.627 --> 14:55.695
To destroy completely.

14:55.762 --> 14:57.064
I get in trivia mode, and...

14:57.130 --> 14:58.665
the mind starts going, okay?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.233
Okay. No, I get it completely.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.235
This is why my parents
sent me here.

15:02.302 --> 15:03.971
Oh, really?
To play, uh, pub games

15:04.037 --> 15:05.572
with your former
one-night stand?

15:05.638 --> 15:07.040
To have good clean fun.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.675
Yeah, well...

15:08.741 --> 15:10.377
this was fun.

15:10.443 --> 15:12.679
And nobody got
any body parts zipped up

15:12.745 --> 15:14.747
into somebody else's clothing,
so there's that.

15:14.814 --> 15:17.117
You are not gonna let me live
that down, are you?

15:17.184 --> 15:19.119
No, I am not.
(chuckles)

15:19.186 --> 15:20.687
You want to do it again
sometime?

15:20.753 --> 15:22.022
I mean, not the zipper thing.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.458
The-the good clean,
unbloody fun.

15:25.525 --> 15:27.194
I'd love that.

15:27.260 --> 15:28.928
Yeah? Uh, I think they got a...

15:28.996 --> 15:31.464
darts tournament here tomorrow
afternoon, if you're into it.

15:31.531 --> 15:34.267
Then I guess I'll see you
tomorrow, George.

15:34.334 --> 15:36.469
Okay. Yes, you will. Go, team.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.471
All right.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.544
Ooh! (chuckles) Hi.

15:48.515 --> 15:50.450
(grunting softly)

15:53.953 --> 15:55.022
(sighs)

15:55.088 --> 15:56.489
Something's different.

15:56.556 --> 15:57.624
I've been shopping.

15:57.690 --> 15:59.192
Getting all sorts of ready.

15:59.259 --> 16:01.995
Sleeping bag, tent,
chest harness.

16:02.062 --> 16:03.430
Did we join the Israeli army?

16:03.496 --> 16:05.698
Oh, no. Literally the opposite.

16:05.765 --> 16:08.968
Me, you, a Christian youth group

16:09.036 --> 16:10.137
zip-lining!

16:10.203 --> 16:11.604
Yeah, no, we're not doing that.

16:11.671 --> 16:13.573
Oh, no-- yes, we are.
It's gonna be great!

16:13.640 --> 16:14.907
This may surprise you,

16:14.974 --> 16:16.509
but I am tragically,
deathly

16:16.576 --> 16:17.644
afraid of heights.

16:17.710 --> 16:18.778
No, you're not.

16:18.845 --> 16:20.380
Oh, yes, I assure you, I am.

16:20.447 --> 16:22.115
But an entire section
of your novel takes place

16:22.182 --> 16:23.683
on top of a mountain.
Yes, but I didn't
write it

16:23.750 --> 16:26.186
on top of a mountain.
I wrote it in a duplex.

16:26.253 --> 16:27.787
I can't even go
on the High Line

16:27.854 --> 16:29.189
without taking a Valium.

16:29.256 --> 16:32.059
(sighs)
I-I promised Reverend Mayfair.

16:32.125 --> 16:34.327
Oh, no.
Is this because of the accident?

16:34.394 --> 16:36.563
Yeah, I already sent him
a fruit basket, you know,

16:36.629 --> 16:38.565
an expensive one-- like, not one
of those where there's, like,

16:38.631 --> 16:40.800
one star fruit on top
of a ton of cantaloupe.

16:40.867 --> 16:42.435
It's more than
the accident.
No, I can't go.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.204
You don't understand...
I do have a phobia...

16:44.271 --> 16:46.073
which I definitely do...
Please don't make me tell you...

16:46.139 --> 16:48.308
I don't like the outdoors!
I really don't
want to tell you.

16:48.375 --> 16:50.443
I have allergies, my neck hurts
If I say it, I'm going
to regret it.

16:50.510 --> 16:51.711
if I don't use my memory foam...
We have to go because only 13%

16:51.778 --> 16:53.046
of the people in this town

16:53.113 --> 16:54.181
think you're the right guy
for me.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.549
I'm sorry. What?

16:56.616 --> 16:58.085
There was this poll.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.120
But it doesn't matter
'cause we can fix it.

17:00.187 --> 17:02.289
With Reverend Mayfair's
endorsement,

17:02.355 --> 17:04.624
people will see how
great you are.

17:04.691 --> 17:05.791
Then they'll see

17:05.858 --> 17:06.959
how great we are.

17:07.026 --> 17:08.661
Come on. We have to go camping.

17:08.728 --> 17:09.862
(chuckles)

17:09.929 --> 17:11.664
I'm not going camping.

17:11.731 --> 17:13.133
Wait. Yes, you are.

17:13.200 --> 17:14.901
No. No, I'm not. You know,

17:14.967 --> 17:17.369
if the people of BlueBell don't
like me, that's their problem.

17:17.436 --> 17:19.205
No, Joel, it's our problem.

17:19.271 --> 17:21.241
You won't be happy
here unless you fit in.

17:21.308 --> 17:23.510
And I want you to be happy!

17:23.576 --> 17:26.246
Well, you know what would make
me happy is not zip-lining!

17:26.313 --> 17:27.914
Fine! Don't go!

17:27.980 --> 17:30.083
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I have to figure out a way

17:30.150 --> 17:33.486
to tell Reverend Mayfair that
he's not getting lucky tomorrow!

17:36.789 --> 17:38.558
What?
(door slams)

17:41.027 --> 17:43.696
(baby crying)
And now we are teething.

17:43.763 --> 17:46.299
But, thanks to
your little plan,

17:46.366 --> 17:48.801
tonight it is Bertie
and Marge's problem.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.804
Oh, you're a saint,
Zoe Hart.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.805
Right. About that.

17:52.872 --> 17:54.741
Um, some bad news.

17:54.807 --> 17:58.178
It turns out Joel has
a medical condition--
acrophobia-- fear of heights.

17:58.245 --> 18:00.313
So it would be really unsafe
for him to go

18:00.380 --> 18:01.714
on any sort of trip
where the main activity

18:01.781 --> 18:04.151
involves flying through trees
on a wire.

18:04.217 --> 18:05.652
I'm sorry, but are you writing

18:05.718 --> 18:08.155
your boyfriend a doctor's note?
Here, sweetheart.

18:08.221 --> 18:10.190
Uh, may I remind you

18:10.257 --> 18:12.058
that I also have
a medical condition?

18:12.125 --> 18:13.326
Whiplash.

18:13.393 --> 18:15.662
Yes, which I feel
really bad about,

18:15.728 --> 18:17.130
but...
No, no, no.

18:17.197 --> 18:19.366
I'm sorry, but you cannot
back out of this.

18:19.432 --> 18:21.968
Now... I have bought champagne.

18:22.034 --> 18:24.304
Beverly has bought
some lingerie.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.973
We need this.
And, if I remember correctly,

18:27.039 --> 18:29.442
you need a sermon.

18:29.509 --> 18:33.045
What if I found someone
to take Joel's place?

18:33.112 --> 18:34.681
Well, that would be fine.

18:34.747 --> 18:37.150
I mean, as long as it's someone
that was reliable

18:37.217 --> 18:39.419
and has basic outdoor experience

18:39.486 --> 18:43.089
and had no criminal record,
that would be kosher with me.

18:43.156 --> 18:45.725
I know just the guy.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.494
No way, no how.

18:47.560 --> 18:49.562
But it's an all-expense
paid vacation!

18:49.629 --> 18:52.665
It'll give us a chance,
you know, to get over all this.

18:52.732 --> 18:53.666
Bond and such.

18:53.733 --> 18:54.834
It is chaperoning.

18:54.901 --> 18:56.135
And I don't want to bond

18:56.203 --> 18:57.837
because I don't like you.

18:57.904 --> 18:59.239
When are we gonna get over that?

18:59.306 --> 19:00.873
When are you gonna go back
to New York?

19:00.940 --> 19:02.542
See, that is the kind of thing
that we need to get over.

19:03.410 --> 19:05.212
Uncalled for, Tucker!

19:05.278 --> 19:06.546
Hey, Wanda.

19:06.613 --> 19:09.182
How would you like
a free night

19:09.249 --> 19:11.818
at a rustic outdoor resort
with zip-lining?

19:11.884 --> 19:14.221
I'm sorry, Zoe,
but I have to work.

19:14.287 --> 19:16.223
And also, I went to
Tween Adventure Camp

19:16.289 --> 19:19.326
and those girls are mean.

19:20.193 --> 19:21.394
(sighs)

19:21.461 --> 19:23.263
Hey! Jemmaline, Cody!

19:23.330 --> 19:24.364
What do you say?

19:24.431 --> 19:25.232
I'm desperate.

19:25.298 --> 19:27.834
I'll do it.

19:27.900 --> 19:29.168
Not that desperate.

19:30.303 --> 19:31.538
JEFFRIES:
I'll go.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.773
I like the woods.
Nice and quiet.

19:33.840 --> 19:36.175
Oh, thanks,
but this trip involves

19:36.243 --> 19:38.978
a dozen loud 13-year-old girls.

19:39.045 --> 19:40.413
I'll turn off my hearing aid.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.649
Better than nothing.

19:42.715 --> 19:44.651
Hey, Susie, do you think
that you could fit me in

19:44.717 --> 19:45.985
for a haircut this afternoon?

19:46.052 --> 19:47.186
Sure, sugar. 3:00?

19:47.254 --> 19:48.755
3:00. It's a date.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.323
Haircut, huh?

19:50.390 --> 19:51.824
I wonder which pretty brunette
that could be for.

19:51.891 --> 19:54.193
Hmm. Maybe it's the one
who asked me how

19:54.261 --> 19:56.729
to play darts this morning
in Lavon's kitchen.
Okay.

19:56.796 --> 19:58.765
Okay. Lynly and I
are hanging out.

19:58.831 --> 19:59.899
It's no big deal.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.334
No big deal.

20:01.401 --> 20:02.802
Just make sure you marry her.
(chuckles)

20:02.869 --> 20:04.070
Excuse me?

20:04.136 --> 20:05.938
Well, you and Lavon,
you're buds now.

20:06.005 --> 20:08.441
You know, he probably thinks
you're a stand-up guy.

20:08.508 --> 20:10.310
But when you hurt
his little Lynly?

20:10.377 --> 20:11.944
That man will pull out
your toes,

20:12.011 --> 20:13.813
one by one, and he will
stick them up your nose.

20:13.880 --> 20:16.383
And I'd have to lend a hand
'cause I don't pay rent

20:16.449 --> 20:18.851
and he expects me to help out
with that kind of thing.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.091
LEMON: Okay, Elodie,
let's remove

20:25.157 --> 20:27.360
a few of those swans.
There's no need to be gaudy.

20:28.361 --> 20:29.329
LAVON:
Wow.

20:29.396 --> 20:30.330
We may actually make it.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.464
Oh, we'll make it.

20:31.531 --> 20:32.999
This ain't my first rodeo.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.801
Crickett, let me see
those dahlias.

20:35.868 --> 20:37.470
You guys need a hand?

20:37.537 --> 20:38.771
Oh, yeah, that would be great.

20:38.838 --> 20:40.607
Um, these begonias
need planting.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.609
Actually, I really need
to keep my nails dirt-free,

20:42.675 --> 20:44.911
because I kind of might have
a date later.

20:44.977 --> 20:46.913
A date? With who?

20:46.979 --> 20:47.947
(phone chimes)

20:51.284 --> 20:52.585
With you!

20:52.652 --> 20:53.953
To watch one
of those...

20:54.020 --> 20:55.355
bug war shows. Yay!

20:55.422 --> 20:56.956
(chuckles)
Now hand me

20:57.023 --> 20:58.325
a digger thingy.
Oh. Yeah.

21:01.127 --> 21:03.262
Oh, uh, I'll be right back.

21:07.500 --> 21:10.069
Did you hire Frank
to find Peter?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.504
He's the town P.I.

21:11.571 --> 21:13.373
I support local business.

21:13.440 --> 21:15.074
Plus, he-he ain't that bad.

21:15.141 --> 21:16.309
FRANK:
Not bad?

21:16.376 --> 21:17.777
I'm excellent!

21:17.844 --> 21:19.946
You know how difficult
this task has been?

21:20.012 --> 21:23.149
Peter is the third most
common name in the world!

21:23.215 --> 21:26.118
Well, I mean, I knew it
was gonna be a long shot.

21:26.185 --> 21:29.188
But, since I also knew
he was a news producer

21:29.255 --> 21:32.759
and stayed at the Sandy Breeze,
it helped narrow things down.

21:32.825 --> 21:35.261
So you did find him?
Well, let a man tell a story!

21:35.328 --> 21:36.463
LEMON:
Okay, can you just tell...

21:36.529 --> 21:38.064
Did you find him or not?

21:38.130 --> 21:39.999
I narrowed it down to one man.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.134
Peter Galecki.

21:42.201 --> 21:45.037
News producer
for WZVR.

21:45.104 --> 21:48.074
Peter Galecki?

21:48.140 --> 21:50.477
GIRLS (chanting):
Zip-line! Zip-line! Zip-line...!

21:53.212 --> 21:54.981
Zip-line! Zip-line...!

21:55.047 --> 21:56.783
Zoe?!

21:56.849 --> 21:58.485
Hey, Rev. Wait--
can I call you Rev?

21:58.551 --> 22:00.186
Because I feel like
we're good enough friends

22:00.252 --> 22:01.388
where I can
call you Rev.

22:01.454 --> 22:03.823
No! No, no, no, no, no.

22:03.890 --> 22:05.157
What? No Rev?

22:05.224 --> 22:07.159
No! Sergeant,
how are you?

22:07.226 --> 22:09.562
Good, good.

22:09.629 --> 22:11.998
No. Sergeant Jeffries is
completely unacceptable

22:12.064 --> 22:13.265
as a co-counselor.

22:13.332 --> 22:14.701
You two are apt to set

22:14.767 --> 22:16.636
a forest fire out there.
You know what?

22:16.703 --> 22:18.438
Just forget it. I'm going.

22:18.505 --> 22:20.540
Really, dear? Really?

22:21.708 --> 22:23.242
All right, on second thought--

22:23.309 --> 22:25.244
do not move this bus
for ten minutes.

22:25.311 --> 22:26.613
I'll be right back.

22:31.183 --> 22:35.187
Huh. He is surprisingly agile
for a man of the cloth.

22:35.254 --> 22:36.989
Mm.

22:37.056 --> 22:39.526
I can't believe you're really
going through with this.

22:39.592 --> 22:41.060
Look, Joel,
this town has few perks,

22:41.127 --> 22:43.863
but the one that has kept me
here is the feeling,

22:43.930 --> 22:46.866
for the first time in my life,
that I belong to a community.

22:46.933 --> 22:49.035
And I wanted you
to feel that, too.

22:49.101 --> 22:50.603
So I'm doing it for us.

22:51.938 --> 22:54.106
A popular thought is
to always keep your weight

22:54.173 --> 22:55.408
on the top of your feet.

22:55.475 --> 22:56.543
That's ridiculous!

22:56.609 --> 22:58.344
The weight should be

22:58.411 --> 22:59.812
on the bottom of your feet.

22:59.879 --> 23:03.349
George! Mr. Outdoors!
How you doing?

23:03.416 --> 23:04.984
Any big plans tonight?

23:05.051 --> 23:07.454
Uh, actually, I had a date,
but...
Oh, great.

23:07.520 --> 23:10.289
'Cause this guy
needs a favor.

23:10.356 --> 23:13.426
And, uh,
that guy does, too.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.428
Sergeant Jeffries?
Yeah.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.864
Glad I found you.
Um, Delma said that
she needs you

23:17.930 --> 23:20.132
to step in and run bingo night
over at the community center.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.300
All right.
And don't worry.

23:21.367 --> 23:22.569
I got all this.

23:22.635 --> 23:23.970
All right, but, uh,
be careful

23:24.036 --> 23:25.204
of the one with the
pink hair, though.

23:25.271 --> 23:27.306
I think she's a wiccan.

23:27.373 --> 23:28.741
Noted. Noted.

23:28.808 --> 23:30.810
Um, this does not
mean we're friends.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.512
Good morning, girls.
You ready to go?!

23:32.579 --> 23:35.848
(screaming)

23:38.150 --> 23:40.086
(screaming continues)

23:43.590 --> 23:45.492
Wow. People, uh...

23:45.558 --> 23:46.926
people really
like that guy.

23:46.993 --> 23:49.361
Oh, yeah, George Tucker
is the best.

23:49.428 --> 23:51.397
Of course, you must be
pretty great yourself,

23:51.464 --> 23:53.132
or our Dr. Hart wouldn't
have volunteered

23:53.199 --> 23:55.902
to swing through the woods
with a bunch of gossipy tweens

23:55.968 --> 23:58.204
just to make me
make you feel welcome.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.772
I'll see you Sunday, compadre.

24:18.457 --> 24:21.628
I'm setting up my tent.

24:23.462 --> 24:26.766
Can you show me
how to set up my tent?

24:26.833 --> 24:29.602
Why, exactly, are you leading
a church camping trip again?

24:29.669 --> 24:31.070
It's a long story.

24:31.137 --> 24:32.605
Well, I'm sure that's
not gonna keep you

24:32.672 --> 24:33.973
from wanting to tell it.

24:34.040 --> 24:35.908
There was a poll.
People don't like Joel.

24:35.975 --> 24:38.511
Shocker.
I think it might
be his lamp.

24:38.578 --> 24:40.412
You know, writers are
a unique breed.

24:40.479 --> 24:42.014
Nope, that's not it.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.516
Okay.

24:43.583 --> 24:44.984
11-year-old girl,
thanks for your input.

24:45.051 --> 24:48.387
Name is Maisie, and
I didn't vote for Joel,

24:48.454 --> 24:50.089
my parents didn't
vote for Joel,

24:50.156 --> 24:52.692
none of the girls
here voted for Joel,

24:52.759 --> 24:55.562
because we think you
should be with him.

24:55.628 --> 24:56.829
(laughs)
Wait. What?

24:56.896 --> 24:58.364
Him?! Wait.
No, that's...

24:58.430 --> 25:00.366
Seriously, that's what
the poll's about?

25:00.432 --> 25:01.968
Ridiculous!
Sure.

25:02.034 --> 25:03.936
The day George left Lemon
at the altar

25:04.003 --> 25:06.706
because he secretly loved Zoe
was, like, the most dramatic day

25:06.773 --> 25:08.107
in BlueBell history.

25:08.174 --> 25:09.809
It so was.
Totally!

25:09.876 --> 25:11.811
It was in the newspapers
and everything.

25:11.878 --> 25:14.681
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
it was in magazines...

25:14.747 --> 25:16.515
Okay, girls.
Yeah, you know what?
Let's just...

25:16.583 --> 25:19.118
Let's settle down... let's all
just settle down a little bit.

25:19.185 --> 25:21.253
Okay, first off, that
was a long time ago.

25:21.320 --> 25:22.454
Yeah.
And secondly,

25:22.521 --> 25:24.056
nothing, and I mean

25:24.123 --> 25:26.659
nothing ever happened
between Dr. Hart and I, so...

25:26.726 --> 25:29.061
No.
MAISIE:
But,

25:29.128 --> 25:30.296
what about the song?

25:30.362 --> 25:31.598
What...?

25:31.664 --> 25:33.132
Hmm? What song?

25:33.199 --> 25:35.167
GEORGE:
* If she never came to town *

25:35.234 --> 25:37.136
* Then she never
would have found me *

25:37.203 --> 25:39.939
* Driving on the side
of the road *

25:40.006 --> 25:44.143
* When I gave her a ride
and she sat down inside *

25:44.210 --> 25:47.814
* I didn't know
things were about to explode. *
Not a word.

25:50.917 --> 25:52.619
What's up, buddy?
Can I get you a beer?

25:52.685 --> 25:55.154
Actually, whiskey.

25:55.221 --> 25:56.555
And make it a double.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.324
And then, double that.

25:58.390 --> 26:01.493
Quadruple whiskey,
coming right up.

26:01.560 --> 26:03.129
13 percent.

26:03.195 --> 26:04.897
It's not like I'm the
House of Representatives.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.899
Hey, why don't
people like me?

26:06.966 --> 26:08.601
Is it the whole
North-South thing?

26:08.668 --> 26:11.370
Because I thought we, as a
country, had moved past that.

26:11.437 --> 26:13.172
Don't let it bother you,
all right?

26:13.239 --> 26:14.641
I don't care
what people say about me.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.776
Seems to have
gotten me this far.

26:16.843 --> 26:19.311
Tween girls were cheering

26:19.378 --> 26:22.749
for George in the street today,
like he was a British boy band.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.951
So, I mean, even Zoe told me

26:25.017 --> 26:27.586
that she had a thing for him,
right?

26:27.654 --> 26:29.956
Look, there's one thing
I know, it's that

26:30.022 --> 26:33.192
you can't worry about how you
measure up to George Tucker.

26:33.259 --> 26:34.627
'Cause nobody does.

26:34.694 --> 26:36.062
LYNLY:
You're right.

26:36.128 --> 26:37.697
No one does.
How you holding up

26:37.764 --> 26:39.398
over there,
Lonely Hearts Club?

26:39.465 --> 26:42.334
George is great at everything,
except for relationships.

26:42.401 --> 26:45.437
What do you think happened
to make him so messed up?

26:45.504 --> 26:47.373
You mean,
you don't know?

26:47.439 --> 26:49.075
(Dash chuckles)

26:49.141 --> 26:50.810
It all started
when handsome lawyer

26:50.877 --> 26:55.581
George Tucker found beautiful
city doctor Zoe Hart

26:55.648 --> 26:58.685
along the side
of the road.

27:04.056 --> 27:05.692
Everything ready to go?

27:07.293 --> 27:08.728
Gazebo looks great.

27:08.795 --> 27:10.129
(polite laugh)

27:10.196 --> 27:13.565
Are you okay?

27:13.632 --> 27:15.301
I mean, is this
about the address?

27:15.367 --> 27:19.305
You know, the thing is, Lavon,
what if Peter is imaginary?

27:19.371 --> 27:21.573
What-what do you mean?
You-you got the address.

27:21.640 --> 27:22.975
I know, but...

27:23.042 --> 27:26.112
we had a magical night,
but what if...

27:26.178 --> 27:28.681
that's all
it was supposed to be

27:28.748 --> 27:31.751
is just a wonderful memory?

27:33.452 --> 27:35.187
Meatball!

27:35.254 --> 27:37.957
If you want to get
Lemon's attention,

27:38.024 --> 27:41.027
I think I know how you can.

27:43.930 --> 27:45.664
GIRLS: * The cutest guy,
the cutest guy... *

27:45.732 --> 27:47.800
You wrote a song
about me?
Yes, about how much
I hate you.

27:47.867 --> 27:51.437
I don't know why
everyone finds that so romantic.

27:51.503 --> 27:53.072
Okay, so, you wrote it

27:53.139 --> 27:55.574
right after you found
me with Wade in May.

27:55.641 --> 27:57.376
Then you went on tour.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.678
Then, I found you in the motel
all bearded and broken-hearted.

27:59.746 --> 28:01.113
I was broken-hearted
about Tansy,

28:01.180 --> 28:03.015
you egomaniac! And you know
why she rejected me?

28:03.082 --> 28:05.084
Because she heard that song,

28:05.151 --> 28:08.487
and she also found it
to be weirdly romantic.

28:08.554 --> 28:09.989
Oy.
Yeah.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.991
And the worst part is,
now everyone in BlueBell--

28:12.058 --> 28:13.325
they know exactly
how messed up I am.

28:13.392 --> 28:14.861
Can't go on a date
without everyone thinking

28:14.927 --> 28:16.262
I'm gonna break
some poor girl's heart!

28:16.328 --> 28:17.997
Well, you have had
a bad run of it.
No.

28:18.064 --> 28:19.631
You know what the worst part is?

28:19.698 --> 28:21.433
I don't even know if I want
to go on dates anymore.

28:21.500 --> 28:23.870
'Cause I can't really afford
to have my heart broken anymore.

28:23.936 --> 28:26.105
I realize that
that could partly be my fault.

28:26.172 --> 28:27.439
Yeah, I wish

28:27.506 --> 28:28.707
that I would not have gone
to see you that morning,

28:28.775 --> 28:29.942
I definitely wish

28:30.009 --> 28:31.710
I wouldn't have
written that song, and

28:31.778 --> 28:34.513
I wish I would have never picked
you up on the side of the road.

28:34.580 --> 28:36.648
Yeah. No, I can see why.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.284
'Cause if you never met me,

28:38.350 --> 28:41.020
you'd probably be happily
married to Lemon right now.

28:41.087 --> 28:42.654
Okay, that's not fair, Zoe.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.924
Look, George,
I get it, okay?

28:44.991 --> 28:47.159
I get that I came here,
and I complicated things.

28:47.226 --> 28:49.261
And I get that you don't want
to be my friend.

28:49.328 --> 28:51.363
But I just... I wish
that you could figure out

28:51.430 --> 28:52.664
that everything
that's gone wrong

28:52.731 --> 28:54.767
isn't entirely my fault.

28:54.834 --> 28:57.469
I just...

28:57.536 --> 29:02.574
You were the first person
to accept me here.

29:02.641 --> 29:04.911
And I miss you.

29:11.150 --> 29:14.286
DASH:
And the rest is history.

29:14.353 --> 29:15.587
Ooh, I'm late for bingo.

29:15.654 --> 29:17.023
I got to get there early

29:17.089 --> 29:19.225
before the ladies get
all the hot cards.

29:19.291 --> 29:23.830
You want to know why this town
isn't rooting for you and Zoe?

29:23.896 --> 29:25.932
It's the same reason
George won't date me.

29:25.998 --> 29:28.100
Because he and
everyone else

29:28.167 --> 29:31.237
are still waiting for Zoe
and George to get together.

29:31.303 --> 29:32.504
I should have known.

29:32.571 --> 29:33.973
I'm a writer!

29:34.040 --> 29:36.976
You know,
she met George in Act One,

29:37.043 --> 29:39.711
and they all think that I'm just
the Act Two complication,

29:39.778 --> 29:41.981
but, I'm not! I'm not!

29:42.048 --> 29:45.517
I am going to rewrite this
love story so that when

29:45.584 --> 29:49.822
she walks off into the sunset,
it's with me.

29:49.889 --> 29:51.523
What are you gonna do?

29:51.590 --> 29:52.892
I'm going to the woods.

29:52.959 --> 29:54.560
I don't think
that's a good idea.

29:54.626 --> 29:56.128
Why not?!

29:56.195 --> 29:58.597
You know, I-I'm a...
I'm a man of action!

29:58.664 --> 30:00.032
I can tap into my

30:00.099 --> 30:02.134
inner... my inner Hemingway,
and, uh, and

30:02.201 --> 30:05.471
my, um...
my "Morman Nailer."

30:05.537 --> 30:06.572
WADE:
Whoa! Wait there, pal.

30:06.638 --> 30:07.673
You, uh... you need a hand?

30:07.739 --> 30:09.308
No! No.
(inhales deeply)

30:09.375 --> 30:11.577
Yes!

30:11.643 --> 30:13.980
Where-where are the woods?

30:14.046 --> 30:15.982
Well, I'll tell you what--

30:16.048 --> 30:17.583
I'll drive you there myself.

30:17.649 --> 30:19.351
Ha!
Yes, I will.

30:19.418 --> 30:21.320
Yeah!
Yeah, buddy.

30:21.387 --> 30:22.855
No, thank you.

30:22.922 --> 30:24.423
Yeah! All right!

30:31.497 --> 30:33.532
Huh. That was awesome.

30:33.599 --> 30:35.501
I am going again.

30:35.567 --> 30:37.336
George is so cool.

30:37.403 --> 30:39.872
I think tonight, you should
sneak into his tent.

30:39.939 --> 30:41.173
We won't tell anyone.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.909
You girls got it all wrong.

30:42.975 --> 30:45.211
I have met the love of my life.

30:45.277 --> 30:48.247
We share the same morals,
humor, background--

30:48.314 --> 30:51.250
somebody you all
should look up to.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.418
Zoe Hart!

30:52.484 --> 30:53.685
(car door closes)

30:53.752 --> 30:55.454
I love you.

30:55.521 --> 30:59.926
And I'm going to show the world
that I am a "fitter-inner."

30:59.992 --> 31:01.928
Joel, what are
you doing here?

31:01.994 --> 31:03.495
Wade, what's he doing here?

31:03.562 --> 31:04.863
Don't look at me--
I'm just the designated driver.

31:04.931 --> 31:06.232
'Cause I was
too drunk to drive.

31:06.298 --> 31:08.634
And I... and I...
I don't know how to drive.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.102
Have you been drinking whiskey?

31:10.169 --> 31:11.971
Remember, whiskey
makes you stupid.

31:12.038 --> 31:14.440
I karate-chopped
a street lamp.

31:14.506 --> 31:15.841
The street lamp won.

31:15.908 --> 31:17.076
How could you bring him here
like this?

31:17.143 --> 31:18.177
Man heard the call
of nature.

31:18.244 --> 31:20.846
Where is he?
Where is he?

31:20.913 --> 31:21.981
Who?

31:22.048 --> 31:23.249
George Tucker,
of course!

31:23.315 --> 31:24.683
What? Why?

31:24.750 --> 31:26.418
GEORGE:
Yeah, baby!

31:26.485 --> 31:27.453
(whoops)

31:27.519 --> 31:29.288
Yeah!
Whoa.

31:29.355 --> 31:30.522
(whoops)

31:30.589 --> 31:31.857
Oh, man! This is awesome!

31:31.924 --> 31:34.826
Of course... of course
it would come to this.

31:34.893 --> 31:38.530
The hero must face
his greatest fear.

31:38.597 --> 31:40.866
Wh... uh, Joel, w-what are
you... what are you doing?

31:40.933 --> 31:43.702
Joel, come down from there.
Come down from there right now.

31:43.769 --> 31:46.705
Attention, BlueBellites!

31:46.772 --> 31:48.707
You have it all wrong!

31:48.774 --> 31:51.243
George Tucker is not

31:51.310 --> 31:53.279
the hero of the Zoe story.

31:53.345 --> 31:54.880
I am!

31:54.947 --> 31:57.249
(girls scream)
Oh, my God!

31:58.084 --> 32:01.220
And I'm gonna prove it.

32:01.287 --> 32:05.291
In the manner of literature's
greatest protagonists...

32:05.357 --> 32:08.694
by zip-lining!

32:08.760 --> 32:10.229
What? No, Joel!

32:10.296 --> 32:10.896
No!

32:10.963 --> 32:11.998
Joel!

32:12.064 --> 32:13.899
See, I think
that you'll find

32:13.966 --> 32:16.735
that the landscaping
reflects the timeless
elegance of the South.

32:16.802 --> 32:19.105
Are you a
gazebo aficionado?

32:19.171 --> 32:21.307
I just kind of...
got the assignment.

32:21.373 --> 32:23.442
(quietly):
Oh, abort, abort, abort.

32:23.509 --> 32:26.078
What?
We have a... situation

32:26.145 --> 32:28.614
over at the gazebo.
We need more time.

32:28.680 --> 32:29.615
(sighs)

32:29.681 --> 32:30.516
Um...

32:30.582 --> 32:32.018
uh... (chuckles)

32:32.084 --> 32:34.053
perhaps Lavon could give you
a quick tour of the town

32:34.120 --> 32:35.254
before we do the shoot.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.456
For context, of course.

32:37.523 --> 32:38.457
LAVON:
Uh,

32:38.524 --> 32:40.226
you know, that's
a great idea.

32:40.292 --> 32:42.428
Uh, we'll be back.

32:46.465 --> 32:48.134
MEATBALL:
Lemon Breeland,

32:48.200 --> 32:50.036
I love you!

32:50.102 --> 32:51.737
Oh, good Lord.

32:53.605 --> 32:56.342
(sighs)

32:56.408 --> 32:58.177
Joel, you have to wear
a harness!

32:58.244 --> 32:59.878
Harness is for pansies!

32:59.945 --> 33:01.613
What... No... Do not jump!

33:01.680 --> 33:04.616
Do not do it! It's dangerous.
You'll kill yourself!

33:04.683 --> 33:05.751
You'll kill yourself!

33:05.817 --> 33:07.653
What?
No, no, no, no.

33:07.719 --> 33:09.921
Hey. I have got this

33:09.988 --> 33:12.358
well in hand!

33:12.424 --> 33:15.194
What the hell
is Joel doing here?

33:15.261 --> 33:16.562
Actually, he's trying to fit in.

33:16.628 --> 33:18.797
GEORGE:
He's gonna hurt himself.

33:18.864 --> 33:19.965
No kidding.

33:20.032 --> 33:21.633
(sighs)
I got him.

33:21.700 --> 33:24.570
Oh, no, no. No, no.
You are not

33:24.636 --> 33:25.971
saving me!

33:26.038 --> 33:28.707
You are not saving me,
Mr. Golden Boy!

33:28.774 --> 33:30.676
(chuckling):
No.

33:30.742 --> 33:31.710
(huffs, grunts)

33:31.777 --> 33:33.112
ZOE:
Joel!

33:33.179 --> 33:34.513
You could kill yourself!

33:34.580 --> 33:37.116
Viva Joel!

33:37.183 --> 33:40.086
(whoops)

33:40.152 --> 33:41.220
(shouting)

33:44.123 --> 33:45.991
It's too bad.

33:46.058 --> 33:48.227
Guy's so worried
about George Tucker.

33:48.294 --> 33:49.861
I know. It's insane.

33:49.928 --> 33:50.762
(yelling anxiously)

33:52.798 --> 33:53.965
Course it is.

33:54.032 --> 33:55.501
Everybody's got it
all wrong.

33:55.567 --> 33:57.403
'Cause you and I
both know damn well...

33:57.469 --> 34:00.272
you're still
in love with me.

34:00.339 --> 34:02.608
Looking good, buddy!

34:02.674 --> 34:04.610
(groaning)

34:12.484 --> 34:14.585
Help.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.155
A little help?

34:17.956 --> 34:19.491
(crickets chirping)

34:19.558 --> 34:21.226
Never seen
that one before.

34:21.293 --> 34:24.396
But I got to tell you,
boy's got chutzpa.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.166
I can't believe you did that.

34:27.233 --> 34:28.634
That was crazy.

34:28.699 --> 34:30.168
You are crazy.

34:30.235 --> 34:32.138
Yes, I am.

34:32.204 --> 34:34.005
It was kind hot, right?

34:34.072 --> 34:35.107
(chuckles)

34:35.174 --> 34:36.375
I'm just gonna...

34:36.442 --> 34:38.177
I'm gonna take a nap.

34:38.244 --> 34:40.746
Sleep it off, babe.
Sleep it off.

34:40.812 --> 34:43.215
Mm-hmm.
(grunts)

34:43.282 --> 34:45.050
(clears throat)
Is, uh...

34:45.117 --> 34:48.187
is he alive?
Yeah.

34:48.254 --> 34:50.589
Super-duper drunk, but alive.

34:50.656 --> 34:51.989
Good.

34:52.056 --> 34:53.925
Good to hear that. Um...

34:53.992 --> 34:55.460
listen, Zoe, I just...

34:55.527 --> 34:58.464
I just wanted to say that I...

34:58.530 --> 35:01.733
do not completely regret it.

35:01.800 --> 35:03.802
Picking you up
on the side of the road.

35:03.869 --> 35:04.803
I don't.

35:04.870 --> 35:06.037
You don't?

35:06.104 --> 35:07.206
No.
(chuckles)

35:07.273 --> 35:10.142
And the disaster
that is my life--

35:10.209 --> 35:14.012
it is not...
entirely your fault.

35:14.079 --> 35:15.314
Really?

35:15.381 --> 35:17.683
Yeah, just, like,
almost 90% of it is.

35:17.749 --> 35:18.950
Oh.
(chuckles)

35:19.017 --> 35:21.287
As moderately satisfying
as it is

35:21.353 --> 35:23.955
for me to blame you for...
everything,

35:24.022 --> 35:27.326
well, I-I realize now
that it's time for me to...

35:27.393 --> 35:29.295
stop dwelling.

35:29.361 --> 35:32.231
So... does this mean
that we are friends again?

35:32.298 --> 35:35.066
Mm.
We-we can be acquaintances

35:35.133 --> 35:36.502
to start.
Yeah. I'll take it.

35:36.568 --> 35:38.537
(chuckles)
MAISIE:
OMG, Zoe,

35:38.604 --> 35:39.338
you were right.

35:39.405 --> 35:41.072
Joel was so brave.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.341
Is he gonna be okay?

35:42.408 --> 35:43.942
I am totally
gonna read his book.

35:44.009 --> 35:45.644
GIRL: I'm gonna read
his book, too!

35:45.711 --> 35:47.179
I'm gonna get his autograph!
I'm gonna get his picture!

35:47.246 --> 35:48.514
I'm gonna
get everything!

35:48.580 --> 35:50.115
I can't believe
he did that!

35:50.182 --> 35:53.352
(girls chattering indistinctly)

35:53.419 --> 35:55.086
LEMON:
 Meatball, you have to go now!

35:55.153 --> 35:56.855
MEATBALL:
Listen to this song I wrote you.

35:56.922 --> 35:59.958
* My love is like a zombie
coming back from the dead *

36:00.025 --> 36:01.660
* You make me weak *

36:01.727 --> 36:03.529
* In my knees and in my head *

36:03.595 --> 36:06.765
* You may like your Crickett,
Elodie or AB *

36:06.832 --> 36:10.969
* But Lemon Breeland
is the one for me. *

36:11.036 --> 36:13.171
(applause)

36:16.875 --> 36:19.144
Well, that was, um...

36:19.211 --> 36:20.412
unique.

36:20.479 --> 36:23.682
And despite being
a little off-key,

36:23.749 --> 36:24.750
it was...

36:24.816 --> 36:27.018
it was very sweet.

36:27.085 --> 36:28.954
You are very sweet.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.356
So you'll take me back?

36:32.758 --> 36:33.959
Meatball...

36:34.025 --> 36:35.427
you were there
for me in a...

36:35.494 --> 36:38.564
moment in time
where I really needed someone.

36:38.630 --> 36:41.967
But some moments in time
are just meant to be that,

36:42.033 --> 36:46.305
just a... a fleeting memory
for us to cling to.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.274
But I don't want anybody else.

36:48.340 --> 36:49.941
Of course you do.

36:50.008 --> 36:53.044
You want someone that's crazy
about your-your songs

36:53.111 --> 36:55.581
and your wardrobe and...

36:55.647 --> 36:58.183
your unique odor and...

36:58.250 --> 37:00.252
Doctor Who.

37:00.319 --> 37:03.322
You didn't like Doctor Who?

37:04.323 --> 37:06.124
(sighs)

37:06.191 --> 37:08.394
So...

37:08.460 --> 37:10.929
are you ready
to unchain yourself?

37:10.996 --> 37:13.865
On one condition.

37:13.932 --> 37:16.067
I want a good-bye kiss.
With tongue.

37:16.134 --> 37:17.669
(scoffs)

37:17.736 --> 37:19.638
Fine.

37:19.705 --> 37:21.273
One kiss.

37:21.340 --> 37:22.908
No tongue.

37:47.899 --> 37:49.368
This is new--

37:49.435 --> 37:50.769
you knocking on my door.

37:50.836 --> 37:52.371
(chuckling):
Yeah. Yeah.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.105
Want to come in?
Uh...

37:54.172 --> 37:57.509
sure. Um...

37:57.576 --> 38:00.111
(groans) Look, Lynly,
I-I just wanted to...

38:00.178 --> 38:02.013
I just wanted to come by
and to say

38:02.080 --> 38:05.083
I'm sorry for cancelling
our date yesterday.

38:05.150 --> 38:06.518
Had an interesting afternoon.

38:06.585 --> 38:09.821
Dash filled me in
on your whole dramatic past.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.256
Oh. Yeah, like I said,

38:11.323 --> 38:13.625
damaged goods.
(chuckles)

38:13.692 --> 38:14.626
I see.

38:14.693 --> 38:16.362
But I really want you
to know that

38:16.428 --> 38:18.564
this isn't about you.

38:18.630 --> 38:21.867
You know, I mean,
besides the manipulation

38:21.933 --> 38:23.268
and the... nakedness

38:23.335 --> 38:25.236
and the... just
the general kookiness,

38:25.303 --> 38:28.840
you... you are really...
pretty great.

38:28.907 --> 38:30.442
It's just that...

38:30.509 --> 38:33.011
(sighs)
the timing's not right.

38:33.078 --> 38:34.713
Okay.

38:34.780 --> 38:35.981
Okay.

38:37.182 --> 38:38.884
(exhales)

38:38.950 --> 38:41.319
(clears throat)

38:41.387 --> 38:43.054
I accept that.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.423
You do?

38:44.490 --> 38:47.058
Course not, George Tucker.

38:47.125 --> 38:49.127
I've got my eyes on you.

38:49.194 --> 38:51.663
And I am gonna wear you down.

38:51.730 --> 38:53.765
Damaged goods and all.

38:53.832 --> 38:54.900
You'll see.

38:58.103 --> 39:00.506
I...

39:02.708 --> 39:04.943
Whew. Quite a sermon today.

39:05.010 --> 39:07.178
Mmm.
Yeah.

39:07.245 --> 39:08.780
The reverend was
in a great mood.

39:08.847 --> 39:09.781
He really was,

39:09.848 --> 39:11.450
right?

39:11.517 --> 39:15.053
So, uh, what'd you decide
to do about Peter?

39:15.120 --> 39:17.956
Nothing.

39:18.023 --> 39:20.358
Uh, I decided
that it was perfect...

39:20.426 --> 39:23.962
as it was, the moonlight walk
and the easy conversation,

39:24.029 --> 39:26.898
and I just think if I try
and recreate it again

39:26.965 --> 39:28.634
or get it back...
It won't be the same.

39:28.700 --> 39:29.735
Exactly.

39:29.801 --> 39:32.704
Well, if-if you do
see him again,

39:32.771 --> 39:35.441
you can brag
about your instrumental role

39:35.507 --> 39:37.709
in landing our gazebo
on the cover

39:37.776 --> 39:40.078
of the Gazebos of Alabama
Calendar.

39:40.145 --> 39:41.747
No way!
(chuckles)

39:41.813 --> 39:43.482
Shut up! Is it amazing?

39:43.549 --> 39:44.450
Let me see.

39:44.516 --> 39:46.251
How do the dahlias look?

39:46.317 --> 39:47.519
Uh, good.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.820
But, um...

39:49.955 --> 39:52.458
Well, you should see
for yourself.

39:52.524 --> 39:54.760
(chuckles)

39:58.329 --> 40:00.532
Of course.
Yeah.

40:00.599 --> 40:03.469
But it is a great shot,
is it not?

40:03.535 --> 40:05.571
It is.
(chuckles)

40:07.305 --> 40:10.008
Hey, Reverend, great sermon.

40:10.075 --> 40:11.276
Thank you.

40:11.342 --> 40:13.144
I'll second that.
It was the...

40:13.211 --> 40:15.380
first sermon I've ever heard,
but it was very well composed.

40:15.447 --> 40:17.382
Well, any time, son.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.685
And thank you two
for covering at the camp.

40:19.751 --> 40:22.954
Uh, a night away was just
what the missus and I needed.

40:23.021 --> 40:25.256
Wasn't it, honey?
Absolutely.

40:25.323 --> 40:27.459
Mm...
Oh...

40:31.563 --> 40:35.133
We're just
gonna go... now.

40:39.505 --> 40:40.806
(gasps)
Oh!

40:40.872 --> 40:42.541
Guys, have you seen
Dash's new poll?

40:42.608 --> 40:44.843
You're up. Way up.

40:44.910 --> 40:47.913
Oh, 35% think Joel
is the right guy for Zoe.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.115
Well, it's not soft-serve
territory yet

40:50.181 --> 40:51.917
but it's progress.

40:51.983 --> 40:53.752
DASH: Joel, I'd
really like it

40:53.819 --> 40:55.386
if you'd come do a reading
at my book club this week.

40:55.453 --> 40:58.023
Sure, I'd love to.
WALLY:
And I have a weekly poker game

40:58.089 --> 40:59.691
I'd love for you to join.

40:59.758 --> 41:01.292
Poker--
see, I can do poker. Thanks.

41:01.359 --> 41:03.862
Seriously? I've never been
invited to poker night.

41:03.929 --> 41:06.565
Well, I'm a man
of the people.

41:06.632 --> 41:09.267
TOM: Joel, tell us more
about zip-lining.

41:09.334 --> 41:10.368
Was it...
was it terrifying?

41:10.435 --> 41:11.837
Did you puke? Oh, oh,

41:11.903 --> 41:14.305
did the firemen
have a Dalmatian?

41:14.372 --> 41:16.241
Oh, hey! I'll have you know

41:16.307 --> 41:18.777
Joel's numbers have doubled
since last night.
Mm.

41:18.844 --> 41:20.445
Well, just remember,
there's a...

41:20.512 --> 41:23.649
pretty big margin of
error on those things.

41:27.385 --> 41:28.820
...and I was totally unaware.

41:28.887 --> 41:30.221
I didn't know where I was
or what I was doing.

41:30.288 --> 41:31.990
And somewhere in the middle,
I looked down

41:32.057 --> 41:33.759
and I'm, like,
"Oh, my God! I'm in the air!"

41:33.825 --> 41:36.895
(laughter,
indistinct conversation)
