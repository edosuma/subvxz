03:23.469 --> 03:26.738
Up here.

04:10.517 --> 04:13.719
Want me to make it
play again?

04:53.693 --> 04:55.961
Find.

04:55.963 --> 04:58.463
Faro. Find.

06:45.972 --> 06:47.706
Shh.

07:10.129 --> 07:13.432
Uhh... ugh! Ah!

07:43.963 --> 07:46.164
Whoo!

07:46.166 --> 07:48.567
Whoo!

07:49.869 --> 07:51.937
Whoo!

08:19.765 --> 08:21.867
Whoo!

08:21.869 --> 08:24.603
Whoo! Whoo!

08:24.605 --> 08:26.738
Hey, get out of there.

08:26.740 --> 08:28.240
Get out of there quick!

08:28.242 --> 08:30.842
Come on, you need to...
You need to get out of there.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.777
Okay, okay, I'm good.

08:32.779 --> 08:34.546
- I'm good... let me get...
- Get down, get down.

08:34.548 --> 08:36.648
- Hey, get down.
- Who are you?

08:36.650 --> 08:39.183
- Hey...
- Who are you?

08:39.186 --> 08:41.219
- Whoa, no, no, no...
- Where are the others?

08:41.221 --> 08:43.054
There... who?

08:43.056 --> 08:45.724
- Shit.
- Where are the others?

08:45.726 --> 08:47.592
- Where are they?
- There aren't any others.

08:47.594 --> 08:49.761
I don't know what to say.
It's just me.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.097
You just need to get
out of the water, please.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.066
Please, it's just... the water
comes from outside the valley.

08:55.068 --> 08:58.069
You just need to get
out of the water, please.

09:04.043 --> 09:05.243
No!

09:20.993 --> 09:22.193
Are you all right?

09:22.195 --> 09:23.962
Can you do this?

09:23.964 --> 09:25.230
Can you do this?
I can't do it.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.765
Can you help me?

09:26.767 --> 09:28.199
What is it?
I'm not gonna hurt you.

09:28.201 --> 09:31.136
I'm not gonna hurt you.
Come on, I need your help.

09:31.138 --> 09:32.904
Take it.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.639
I don't know how to do this.

09:34.641 --> 09:35.874
Uh...

09:39.712 --> 09:43.582
Yeah, I need it once a day.

09:43.584 --> 09:45.951
And this one... Prussian Blue.

09:45.953 --> 09:47.285
I'm not gonna make it anyway.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.688
- Stupid. Stupid!
- We, uh...

09:49.690 --> 09:52.190
I can take your wagon thing
up to the house.

09:52.192 --> 09:54.793
- We have food.
- We have food up there.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.294
Burn my clothes.

09:58.998 --> 10:02.000
And my body too if I die.

10:02.002 --> 10:03.768
What's your name?

10:03.770 --> 10:05.670
Ann.

10:05.672 --> 10:06.972
I'm John.

10:15.381 --> 10:17.882
Uh... uhh!

10:19.151 --> 10:21.386
I'm real sorry.

10:30.630 --> 10:32.030
Okay.

11:23.016 --> 11:25.316
Doing good.

11:25.318 --> 11:27.719
- Doing good.
- Oh...

11:27.721 --> 11:29.954
Oh... ah...

11:29.956 --> 11:32.857
One more, one more.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.328
That's it.

11:37.330 --> 11:39.798
Okay. It's okay.

12:55.842 --> 12:57.942
Shh.

13:48.160 --> 13:53.898
Dear lord,
please bless this man.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.868
He's very sick
and he needs your help.

13:56.870 --> 14:00.038
I know you must have
a plan for us,

14:00.040 --> 14:04.909
but he's sick from a mistake

14:04.911 --> 14:08.046
and I think probably
a good person.

14:08.048 --> 14:13.251
I will serve you
however you see fit.

14:13.253 --> 14:17.388
I'm not saying you don't
know better or whatever, but...

14:19.226 --> 14:21.893
I would feel so blessed if he...

14:21.895 --> 14:26.397
could stay here...
and healthy.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.636
I need that, please.

15:07.306 --> 15:09.440
My dad said to us, you know,

15:09.442 --> 15:11.609
"Keep the farm running,
and..."

15:11.611 --> 15:13.411
Okay.

15:13.413 --> 15:15.380
"We've been blessed
with this valley."

15:15.382 --> 15:16.948
Yeah.

15:16.950 --> 15:18.650
And, uh, as long as
we stay here,

15:18.652 --> 15:20.985
we'd be protected.

15:20.987 --> 15:23.488
Got to be an explanation.

15:23.490 --> 15:26.925
I don't know,
something to do with...

15:26.927 --> 15:30.228
with the weather patterns
or, uh,

15:30.230 --> 15:33.097
maybe the ridge created a...

15:33.099 --> 15:36.634
just a natural buffer zone.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.636
I mean...

15:42.308 --> 15:45.076
It's just crazy
this is still here.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.417
Nah.

15:52.419 --> 15:55.620
Nothing crazy about it.

15:57.390 --> 15:59.123
Why'd they leave the valley?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.558
Why'd they leave
you here by yourself?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.393
They had to go find survivors.

16:02.395 --> 16:03.661
- They, they...
- Survivors?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.097
They said that was
our duty, so...

16:06.099 --> 16:08.299
David was... well,
I mean,

16:08.301 --> 16:10.268
my brother was
supposed to stay here,

16:10.270 --> 16:12.503
but he, um, he snuck away
to look for them

16:12.505 --> 16:15.306
two weeks after they left.

16:15.308 --> 16:17.475
That's him, there.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.483
How old was he?

16:25.485 --> 16:27.051
13.

16:27.053 --> 16:31.322
Well, he's 14 now,
I guess, but...

16:31.324 --> 16:32.991
he'd been talking about

16:32.993 --> 16:35.026
going to go find them
for days,

16:35.028 --> 16:36.761
and he was really upset.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.497
I-I didn't know
how to calm him down.

16:41.467 --> 16:43.368
I'm sorry.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.507
I'm gonna go get
your bed ready.

16:49.509 --> 16:51.442
You need anything?
Water?

16:51.444 --> 16:52.744
I'm good.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.446
Okay, well...

17:38.157 --> 17:40.558
Night.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.326
Night.

18:56.902 --> 18:58.669
Hey!

18:58.671 --> 19:01.172
I really think
you need some more rest.

19:01.174 --> 19:03.407
Maybe, but I couldn't just
sit up in that window,

19:03.409 --> 19:06.310
watch you do all the work
by yourself.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.613
Oh, yeah, come on, you can't...
You can't do work

19:08.615 --> 19:10.648
- like this... not yet.
- I know, I know, I know.

19:10.650 --> 19:13.851
I just meant I wanted to come
down here and watch you do it.

19:15.188 --> 19:16.420
Oh.

19:18.357 --> 19:20.491
What is all this anyway?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.326
Uh, it's gonna be
soybeans,

19:22.328 --> 19:24.829
but... but I get the rocks
out first, so...

19:24.831 --> 19:26.497
Why you doing the work
by hand, though?

19:26.499 --> 19:28.499
- You can't drive this?
- I grew up on a farm.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.568
I know how
better than you.

19:30.570 --> 19:32.270
Ran out of gas.

19:32.272 --> 19:33.704
I used it up last year.
It just...

19:33.706 --> 19:35.873
What about
that country store?

19:35.875 --> 19:37.875
Isn't that a gas station
or just a store?

19:37.877 --> 19:41.212
Well, yeah, but pumps
don't run without electricity.

19:41.214 --> 19:42.480
No, no, no,
you can use...

19:42.482 --> 19:44.922
You can get it
to work manually.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.800
Ah...

20:02.802 --> 20:04.936
Whaa!

20:07.774 --> 20:09.941
Hey!

20:09.943 --> 20:11.509
It worked!

20:13.812 --> 20:16.280
Hey, hey!

20:16.282 --> 20:19.217
It worked!
It worked!

20:34.733 --> 20:37.001
Could you see me
down at the gas pumps?

20:37.003 --> 20:39.303
I was jumping
all over the place.

20:39.305 --> 20:41.472
I was so excited.

20:41.474 --> 20:44.976
Felt weird
pointing a rifle at you

20:44.978 --> 20:46.544
even if it weren't loaded.

20:46.546 --> 20:48.379
Oh, I always
keep it loaded.

20:48.381 --> 20:51.015
It's got a great scope on it,
doesn't it?

20:56.588 --> 20:58.623
This looks good.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.338
Well...

21:14.340 --> 21:16.540
there's a lot
to be thankful for.

21:16.542 --> 21:17.808
Mmm.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.883
You were... you were up north
when it started?

21:25.885 --> 21:27.852
Yeah.

21:27.854 --> 21:32.323
I was, um, about
a mile underground

21:32.325 --> 21:35.660
in a government facility...

21:35.662 --> 21:38.296
A bunker.

21:38.298 --> 21:41.399
I'm a research engineer.

21:41.401 --> 21:44.335
Well, I was.

21:44.337 --> 21:46.704
I mean, like a...

21:46.706 --> 21:47.738
does that mean
you're a scientist

21:47.740 --> 21:49.040
- or something?
- Yeah.

21:49.042 --> 21:50.741
Oh, really?

21:50.743 --> 21:52.576
Well... well, I was.

21:52.578 --> 21:54.378
That's cool.

21:55.914 --> 21:59.950
I was on the design team
for that suit I was wearing.

21:59.952 --> 22:01.585
But it's the only reason
I was able

22:01.587 --> 22:03.487
to survive as long as I did.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.589
They weren't supposed
to be used long-term, though.

22:05.591 --> 22:07.358
It's beat up now.
It's damaged.

22:07.360 --> 22:10.361
So why'd you leave the bunker?

22:10.363 --> 22:12.330
Just wasn't safe there anymore?

22:12.332 --> 22:13.831
Well, I was a mile
underground, you know.

22:13.833 --> 22:16.334
There was no...

22:16.336 --> 22:17.601
there was no sun.

22:17.603 --> 22:19.670
There was no rain.
There was no sky.

22:19.672 --> 22:21.605
There was nothing.

22:21.607 --> 22:23.007
You understand me?

22:23.009 --> 22:25.976
What I wanted from life...

22:25.978 --> 22:27.812
wasn't there.

22:27.814 --> 22:29.980
So I left.

22:29.982 --> 22:32.450
Went to go find your wife.

22:33.985 --> 22:35.786
My wife?

22:36.855 --> 22:38.656
Well, um...

22:38.658 --> 22:40.424
I was just...

22:40.426 --> 22:42.560
When I was going
through your wagon

22:42.562 --> 22:44.929
the other day for...
I was getting your medicine.

22:44.931 --> 22:48.999
I accidentally came across
some photos of your wife.

22:51.403 --> 22:53.504
She's not my wife.

22:53.506 --> 22:55.106
I was...

22:56.742 --> 22:59.410
That was just a girl

22:59.412 --> 23:02.613
from a long time ago,
really.

23:07.085 --> 23:10.020
You know,
the reason I left...

23:12.157 --> 23:14.525
Honestly, what I think
I was looking for

23:14.527 --> 23:17.661
was a place like this...

23:17.663 --> 23:21.999
without ever believing
for a second

23:22.001 --> 23:24.402
that it could exist.

24:48.854 --> 24:51.188
I never thought
I'd eat fresh fish again.

24:51.190 --> 24:52.957
Oh, the pond
is full of them.

24:52.959 --> 24:55.092
We used to get yellow bullhead
from the creek,

24:55.094 --> 24:57.094
but obviously, they died out.

24:57.096 --> 25:00.898
But this pond comes from
the same water as the well does.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.235
Dad says it comes from
an underground pocket of water.

25:04.237 --> 25:05.970
Reckons it's a big part of

25:05.972 --> 25:07.972
what kept this place
from dying out.

25:07.974 --> 25:09.006
An aquifer.

25:09.008 --> 25:10.674
Yeah.

25:10.676 --> 25:13.811
Makes a lot of sense.
He's a smart man.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.913
Oh,
I could eat this every...

25:15.915 --> 25:18.282
Every day of the week.

25:18.284 --> 25:20.618
We can eat it as much
as you want

25:20.620 --> 25:22.853
till the pond freezes over.

25:22.855 --> 25:25.089
What happened last winter?
It snow a lot?

25:25.091 --> 25:26.857
Yeah.

25:26.859 --> 25:29.693
I...I stayed
in the house mostly,

25:29.695 --> 25:32.863
bundled up with Faro.

25:32.865 --> 25:34.865
I mean, I saved food,

25:34.867 --> 25:36.534
but we went through
most of it.

25:36.536 --> 25:39.136
Truth is, uh...

25:39.138 --> 25:43.774
I almost... I almost
froze and starved.

25:45.277 --> 25:47.745
It... it was bad.

25:47.747 --> 25:51.015
Well, that's a good reason
to plant the entire field.

25:51.017 --> 25:52.716
Yeah, I mean even if we
could just get

25:52.718 --> 25:56.854
the freezers up and running,
we could stock up on fish.

25:59.157 --> 26:03.227
I just wish the generator
hadn't broken, you know?

26:03.229 --> 26:05.162
Wait.

26:05.164 --> 26:07.598
You got a generator?

26:09.868 --> 26:11.835
Engine's fried.

26:16.808 --> 26:19.910
It's my fault.
It's...

26:19.912 --> 26:22.012
When it stopped working,

26:22.014 --> 26:24.348
I was goofing around.

26:24.350 --> 26:27.284
I was just... I was...
I was playing a DVD.

26:27.286 --> 26:30.254
Damn it.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.823
I just wanted
to hear people talk.

26:32.825 --> 26:35.759
Well, don't beat yourself up.
This thing's old.

26:35.761 --> 26:37.861
Looks like it's been repaired
a couple of times already.

26:37.863 --> 26:39.763
It was liable
to blow no matter what.

26:39.765 --> 26:41.632
Well, it's too bad
we can't just do,

26:41.634 --> 26:43.267
like a science fair thing

26:43.269 --> 26:46.870
and just run all our clocks
and everything off a potato.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.743
That's a good idea.
Come on.

27:01.653 --> 27:05.389
Yeah, that's a good flow
of water.

27:05.391 --> 27:09.827
We need to build a race
at the top, but...

27:09.829 --> 27:12.229
it's enough
to spin a generator.

27:12.231 --> 27:13.998
As long as there's enough
cable to reach the house,

27:14.000 --> 27:15.399
we have power.

27:15.401 --> 27:16.900
The lights might flicker,

27:16.902 --> 27:18.335
but we could
get the freezer going.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.703
Wait, it doesn't...
It doesn't matter

27:19.705 --> 27:21.005
that the water's radioactive?

27:21.007 --> 27:22.306
Not at all.

27:22.308 --> 27:24.208
Water's just got to
flow downhill.

27:24.210 --> 27:28.412
It's perfect.

27:28.414 --> 27:30.881
What do you mean?

27:32.183 --> 27:34.718
It's the water wheel.

27:38.823 --> 27:41.859
How much wood do we need?

27:41.861 --> 27:43.794
Well, you saw it.

27:43.796 --> 27:46.296
We need most of this,
right?

27:46.298 --> 27:48.399
Could we just... could we
use something else?

27:48.401 --> 27:50.234
Maybe...

27:50.236 --> 27:53.937
Well, no, we can't...
We can't use the house.

27:53.939 --> 27:56.273
We need the barn.
We can't use the store.

27:56.275 --> 27:58.876
It's all cinder block.
No, this is it.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.444
Well...

28:00.446 --> 28:02.680
- What?
- I mean...

28:02.682 --> 28:04.448
What?

28:04.450 --> 28:08.318
My dad... built that.

28:08.320 --> 28:13.257
He... he preached there
every Sunday, you know?

28:13.259 --> 28:15.392
And it's 'cause of Him
that we survived,

28:15.394 --> 28:19.229
that, you know,
that all of this survived,

28:19.231 --> 28:21.999
- So...
- 'Cause of your father?

28:22.001 --> 28:25.169
No, no,
'cause... 'cause of Him.

28:34.312 --> 28:38.148
What, if we tear down
the church, we don't survive?

28:40.151 --> 28:43.053
All right.

28:44.989 --> 28:46.356
Look...

28:53.898 --> 28:55.499
I know it's hard.

28:57.469 --> 28:59.369
I know it's hard.

29:01.206 --> 29:05.409
But if you got to tear down
a church to get electricity...

29:05.411 --> 29:07.344
But we don't really need
electricity.

29:07.346 --> 29:11.281
It's about... rebuilding.

29:12.951 --> 29:17.020
Maybe God...

29:17.022 --> 29:20.124
or your father...

29:20.126 --> 29:22.326
put this here for us.

29:25.897 --> 29:28.137
So we can...
We can start again.

29:32.270 --> 29:34.772
Maybe that's why we're here...

29:37.175 --> 29:39.376
Just to start again.

29:41.112 --> 29:44.014
- Yeah.
- We get a generator,

29:44.016 --> 29:46.450
get electricity,

29:46.452 --> 29:49.453
plant the fields.

29:49.455 --> 29:51.889
We store up food for us.

29:54.325 --> 29:58.028
You never know.
Maybe we store up food

29:58.030 --> 29:59.897
- for more than just us.
- Why?

29:59.899 --> 30:01.565
You think more people will come?

30:01.567 --> 30:03.300
I mean, if more people
are coming,

30:03.302 --> 30:05.235
then we should definitely
keep the church.

30:05.237 --> 30:06.970
- No.
- I know you don't

30:06.972 --> 30:09.573
- think it's important, but...
- No, no, no, I...

30:09.575 --> 30:12.009
That's not what I meant.

30:33.264 --> 30:35.365
Faro. Faro.

30:38.270 --> 30:39.837
What's wrong with you?

30:39.839 --> 30:41.972
Hey, come on.

30:41.974 --> 30:43.974
Come on.

31:15.974 --> 31:17.875
Ann, hey, Ann!

31:20.645 --> 31:23.080
- Oh, hey.
- Let's call it a day.

31:23.082 --> 31:25.249
My dad would never say that.

31:25.251 --> 31:28.151
He would just keep me out here
till I couldn't see anymore

31:28.153 --> 31:30.393
and have me plowing all zigzag.

31:34.158 --> 31:35.459
John!

31:37.095 --> 31:39.162
Just come down.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.667
Okay.

31:43.669 --> 31:45.102
You know, I just...

31:45.104 --> 31:46.970
I think I need to finish this.

31:46.972 --> 31:48.372
You go on up to the house
and rest.

31:48.374 --> 31:50.474
I just... you know,
I got to get this done.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.910
I'll be up there soon.

31:58.549 --> 32:00.651
I'll see you in a bit.

32:40.725 --> 32:43.060
Oh!

32:43.062 --> 32:45.996
I thought you'd left.

32:49.368 --> 32:52.035
I'm here, relaxing.

32:52.037 --> 32:54.404
Found out a lot of stuff
about you.

32:56.075 --> 32:58.508
I found out...

32:58.510 --> 33:00.243
You all right?

33:00.245 --> 33:02.646
That Annie...

33:02.648 --> 33:03.714
loves M&Ms,

33:03.716 --> 33:05.282
- huh?
- Oh.

33:05.284 --> 33:07.551
Yeah. Ha.

33:08.753 --> 33:10.153
Uhh.

33:12.023 --> 33:13.623
I found out that Annie...

33:13.625 --> 33:15.525
Oh... it's all right.

33:15.527 --> 33:18.362
Likes these, uh...
what's this?

33:18.364 --> 33:21.498
I don't know,
but you like them.

33:21.500 --> 33:23.667
- A candy.
- Annie...

33:23.669 --> 33:26.670
Annie likes Goldfish
baked snack crackers,

33:26.672 --> 33:28.205
huh?

33:28.207 --> 33:29.306
Yeah.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.709
I was investigating,

33:32.711 --> 33:37.214
and I found out that one thing
you don't like...

33:37.216 --> 33:39.249
Annie...

33:39.251 --> 33:42.052
don't like...

33:42.054 --> 33:44.054
cherry soda.

33:44.056 --> 33:46.289
Huh?

33:46.291 --> 33:48.158
Even at the end
of the world,

33:48.160 --> 33:52.129
Annie ain't gonna drink
no damn cherry soda.

33:52.131 --> 33:54.564
I'm sorry... I shouldn't be
swearing, right?

33:54.566 --> 33:56.366
I know.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.601
I think we, uh...

33:57.603 --> 33:59.302
I'm sorry.
No, no, no, no...

33:59.304 --> 34:00.704
I think
we head on home.

34:00.706 --> 34:03.140
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

34:08.612 --> 34:11.081
Says a lot about you.

34:13.117 --> 34:15.318
All right.
Your jacket.

34:15.320 --> 34:17.587
Let me get this off.

34:17.589 --> 34:19.623
Okay.

34:19.625 --> 34:22.659
Let's get this off.
Come on.

34:22.661 --> 34:24.094
No, I... I can do it.

34:24.096 --> 34:25.728
- I can do it.
- Okay.

34:25.731 --> 34:28.532
I can do it,
all right?

34:28.534 --> 34:31.768
I don't...

34:31.770 --> 34:33.703
I don't need your help

34:33.705 --> 34:36.540
all the fucking time,
okay?

34:36.542 --> 34:39.109
Okay.

34:39.110 --> 34:43.313
I don't need your help
all the time, okay?

34:48.286 --> 34:50.420
I don't need...

34:50.422 --> 34:52.121
Okay.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.391
I don't need your help
all the time, okay?

34:54.393 --> 34:56.126
Okay?

34:56.128 --> 34:57.627
I don't need your help
all the time.

34:57.629 --> 34:59.229
That's okay.

35:04.435 --> 35:06.570
I'm... I'm sorry.

35:09.842 --> 35:11.641
I can do it.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.905
I owe you, uh...

35:41.907 --> 35:44.374
I owe you breakfast,
I think.

35:47.745 --> 35:50.147
Okay.

35:50.149 --> 35:52.616
I don't...
I don't know what to say.

35:54.585 --> 35:55.886
I...

35:59.590 --> 36:03.226
It's okay.

36:03.228 --> 36:05.395
It's fine.

36:34.659 --> 36:37.427
You didn't like
what I was playing?

36:37.429 --> 36:40.197
You left before
I could finish.

36:40.199 --> 36:43.600
I mean, I do know
other songs too.

36:43.602 --> 36:45.435
They all just sort of
sound like hymns

36:45.437 --> 36:46.937
'cause of the organ.

36:46.939 --> 36:48.772
I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:48.774 --> 36:51.675
At the chapel just now.

36:51.677 --> 36:53.810
Uh-huh.

37:07.526 --> 37:11.228
I'm, uh, underdressed.

37:11.230 --> 37:12.996
No, not at all.

37:19.538 --> 37:22.639
Look what I found down
at the store.

37:24.842 --> 37:27.310
Is that a good idea?

37:27.312 --> 37:29.279
Oh, we don't...

37:29.281 --> 37:30.914
- It's fine.
- We don't have to.

37:30.916 --> 37:34.451
No, no, no, I think
we'll be okay with one bottle.

37:34.453 --> 37:35.919
Let's open it.

37:40.758 --> 37:43.526
You drunk wine before, right?

37:43.528 --> 37:45.528
Mm-hmm, of course.

37:46.864 --> 37:49.833
So pretty.

37:56.875 --> 37:59.876
Oops, oops.

37:59.878 --> 38:01.845
- You want some more?
- No, no, no, no, no.

38:01.847 --> 38:03.446
Maybe that's enough, huh?

38:03.448 --> 38:05.715
- Maybe we should save it.
- It's okay.

38:17.061 --> 38:20.363
I want things to be good
between us.

38:20.365 --> 38:21.865
So do I.

38:21.867 --> 38:24.027
What do you want to do?

38:31.343 --> 38:33.743
You want to dance?

38:33.745 --> 38:35.512
Ha ha.

38:35.514 --> 38:38.381
I don't know
how to dance to this.

38:38.383 --> 38:40.317
Me neither.

38:40.319 --> 38:42.852
Come on.

38:42.854 --> 38:44.054
Please?

38:44.056 --> 38:46.022
All right.

39:56.127 --> 39:59.162
This was...

39:59.164 --> 40:02.932
It was a lovely evening.

40:02.934 --> 40:05.168
Thank you.

40:15.946 --> 40:18.448
We should go to bed.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.785
Okay.

40:31.662 --> 40:33.062
Good night.

41:35.526 --> 41:37.160
I don't understand.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.966
- What did I do wrong?
- Nothing.

41:42.968 --> 41:45.448
You didn't do anything wrong.

41:47.672 --> 41:51.708
Look, I...
I want you, okay?

41:51.710 --> 41:54.844
I really do.

41:54.846 --> 41:58.114
- Really?
- Yeah.

41:58.116 --> 42:00.617
But it's...

42:00.619 --> 42:03.620
it's gonna change things.

42:03.622 --> 42:07.190
I mean, it's... it's gonna
change everything,

42:07.192 --> 42:09.592
and not just for you.

42:12.096 --> 42:14.898
We need time...

42:14.900 --> 42:18.034
and it's okay,
'cause we got time.

42:18.036 --> 42:20.603
All right?

42:27.778 --> 42:29.178
Okay.

42:33.250 --> 42:35.051
You want me to leave?

42:35.053 --> 42:37.020
Oh, no, no.

42:37.022 --> 42:39.989
- No, I want you to stay.
- Okay.

42:39.991 --> 42:43.326
I want you
to stay with me, okay?

42:43.328 --> 42:44.894
Okay.

42:57.274 --> 42:59.576
You can have the church.

42:59.578 --> 43:02.579
No, no, no.

43:02.581 --> 43:04.814
It's just a project.

43:04.816 --> 43:06.849
It's not worth making you upset.

43:06.851 --> 43:08.318
It's not.

43:08.320 --> 43:09.786
It really means something

43:09.788 --> 43:11.254
that you put
all this thought into it

43:11.256 --> 43:13.656
and you... you're
thinking long-term for us.

43:13.658 --> 43:15.925
That really means something.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.629
Thoughts are the easy part.

43:19.631 --> 43:21.297
Hard part's finding a reason.

43:23.001 --> 43:25.068
It's fine.

43:25.070 --> 43:27.770
There's a lot of projects.

44:24.995 --> 44:27.130
Seems like a...

44:27.132 --> 44:29.365
a good dog.

44:29.367 --> 44:32.435
Solid dog.

44:32.437 --> 44:36.706
I mean you no harm, ma'am.

44:36.708 --> 44:38.941
All I'd ask you for
is a glass of water

44:38.943 --> 44:42.712
if you know where to find one.

44:42.714 --> 44:44.080
My name's Caleb.

44:48.385 --> 44:50.887
- Ann!
- Hey, no, no!

44:50.889 --> 44:52.822
No, no, no,
it's all right.

44:52.824 --> 44:53.824
It's all right.

44:55.259 --> 44:56.759
It's fine.

44:56.761 --> 44:58.327
It's okay, it's fine.

45:06.304 --> 45:09.172
Why would you steal our eggs?

45:09.174 --> 45:11.240
I'm sorry, ma'am.

45:11.242 --> 45:14.010
Not everyone's hospitable
like y'all are.

45:14.012 --> 45:16.846
You say you come
from 50 miles from here?

45:16.848 --> 45:18.381
Yes, sir.
I worked in the mines

45:18.383 --> 45:20.483
about three counties over,
near Big Sandy Creek.

45:20.485 --> 45:22.785
We used to play their school
in soccer, John.

45:22.787 --> 45:24.921
Uh-huh.

45:26.990 --> 45:28.424
Like you, Mr. Loomis,

45:28.426 --> 45:30.927
I was underground
when the shit hit the fan.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.228
Excuse the language, ma'am.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.430
It's okay.

45:34.432 --> 45:37.066
Most of the guys had families.

45:37.068 --> 45:40.903
They went up looking,
never came back.

45:40.905 --> 45:42.939
Finally ran out of food.

45:42.941 --> 45:44.807
Decided to take my chances.

45:44.809 --> 45:48.144
How long were you
outside the mine?

45:48.146 --> 45:50.513
Too long.

45:50.515 --> 45:53.750
I been laid up since I found
this hollow a few days ago.

45:53.752 --> 45:57.120
You know that cave in the...
In the ridge, back round there?

45:57.122 --> 45:58.921
Oh, yeah, I know it.
Yeah, there's a cave

45:58.923 --> 46:00.890
in Claypole Canyon.

46:00.892 --> 46:03.059
Me and my brother used to
go there when we were little

46:03.061 --> 46:04.761
and build forts and things.

46:04.763 --> 46:06.796
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

46:09.066 --> 46:11.300
So what's your plan?

46:19.243 --> 46:21.944
Hmm?
Gonna keep heading south?

46:21.946 --> 46:24.480
Yes, sir,
that's the idea.

46:24.482 --> 46:26.449
If I could stay
in your land for a night,

46:26.451 --> 46:29.018
I'll be out of your hair
by tomorrow morning.

46:32.089 --> 46:34.824
Well, like I said,
you picked up some radiation.

46:34.826 --> 46:36.292
I figured.

46:36.294 --> 46:38.127
I'm kind of weak.

46:38.129 --> 46:39.862
Even puked a couple times.

46:39.864 --> 46:41.998
How bad do you think it is,
John?

46:42.000 --> 46:44.567
Oh, it's nothing
like what I had, but...

46:44.569 --> 46:47.136
you should probably
rest up a couple days.

46:47.138 --> 46:49.338
I'd appreciate that.

46:49.340 --> 46:50.573
Thank you.

46:59.383 --> 47:01.584
What do you think?

47:01.586 --> 47:04.954
I mean, I'm not sure about
the stealing thing, but...

47:04.956 --> 47:07.423
I don't hold
that against him.

47:07.425 --> 47:11.294
Figures he'd be cautious
about how we'd react.

47:11.296 --> 47:13.496
So you're okay with it then?

47:16.099 --> 47:20.069
Look, if the guy wants to
camp out for a couple of days...

47:21.839 --> 47:24.907
John...

47:24.909 --> 47:28.845
are we really not gonna
invite him inside?

47:42.626 --> 47:43.993
Amen.

47:44.995 --> 47:46.195
Amen.

47:54.339 --> 47:57.406
I keep thinking...
I'm gonna wake up

47:57.408 --> 48:00.910
on the side of the road
out there.

48:00.912 --> 48:02.078
You know, it's funny...
Out there,

48:02.080 --> 48:04.580
I'd never take the main roads.

48:04.582 --> 48:09.285
Always take the country trails
or the railroad tracks.

48:09.287 --> 48:12.655
Just...
scared of seeing anybody.

48:14.558 --> 48:18.561
One day, I see this warehouse
by the main road.

48:18.563 --> 48:20.329
There's some water jugs
on the outside.

48:20.331 --> 48:23.633
I'm hoping for water.
Readings were low.

48:27.571 --> 48:32.174
When I come out,

48:32.176 --> 48:34.110
there's someone in my wagon.

48:34.112 --> 48:38.080
It's a boy maybe 13,
maybe even 14 years old.

48:38.082 --> 48:40.616
He must've been on the main
road, coming from the south.

48:40.618 --> 48:42.685
I was scared
of going south back then.

48:42.687 --> 48:45.688
I don't know why.
The fallout... I was...

48:45.690 --> 48:48.057
He's the reason
I came this way.

48:50.060 --> 48:53.596
He was sick...

48:53.598 --> 48:55.231
filthy.

48:55.233 --> 48:58.501
His belly distended,
stealing my food.

48:58.503 --> 49:02.271
Everything he put down,
he just was throwing up.

49:02.273 --> 49:04.540
I couldn't help him.

49:04.542 --> 49:06.442
I get him out of the wagon.

49:06.444 --> 49:09.378
He's grabbing for the door,
so we get into it.

49:09.380 --> 49:12.114
Pulls out a knife.
Swinging at me weakly.

49:12.116 --> 49:14.183
That's when I took out my gun.

49:16.586 --> 49:19.388
Soon as he saw it, he gave up.

49:19.390 --> 49:23.159
Just started crying.

49:23.161 --> 49:27.029
He was on his knees,
just begging me to kill him.

49:31.001 --> 49:34.203
I couldn't do anything.

49:34.205 --> 49:36.973
I just put him off
to the side of the road,

49:36.975 --> 49:39.241
and I left him there to die.

50:04.701 --> 50:06.469
You know
how I said the people

50:06.471 --> 50:11.040
I worked with in the mine
left and never came back?

50:11.042 --> 50:13.275
That's not really true.

50:17.447 --> 50:19.615
It was me and four others.

50:21.351 --> 50:25.221
They were older guys,
family men, like I said.

50:27.157 --> 50:30.793
You know, the first weeks
down there were...

50:30.795 --> 50:33.763
awful.

50:33.765 --> 50:36.732
Phones were down.

50:36.734 --> 50:38.801
Radio station went off
one by one.

50:38.803 --> 50:45.174
Started getting...
claustrophobic,

50:45.176 --> 50:48.644
thinking everybody's plotting
against you.

50:48.646 --> 50:50.746
One of them, Micah...

50:50.748 --> 50:54.784
He's this really big dude,
but a... a gentle fellow...

50:54.786 --> 50:56.519
Well, he just snapped.

50:56.521 --> 50:59.288
Says he's got to get
out of the mine no matter what,

50:59.290 --> 51:01.290
but the others won't let him.

51:01.292 --> 51:02.525
Thought the radiation
would leak inside

51:02.527 --> 51:04.760
if the safe room hatch
was open.

51:04.762 --> 51:06.562
Well, he...

51:06.564 --> 51:09.732
He threw himself on the others.

51:09.734 --> 51:13.836
They ripped each other to shreds
just using their hands.

51:16.807 --> 51:23.145
In the end, only Micah
was left, covered in blood,

51:23.147 --> 51:26.782
and I'm sure
he's gonna kill me too.

51:26.784 --> 51:29.452
But I just... I met his glance.

51:29.454 --> 51:31.587
I looked him back in the eye...

51:37.494 --> 51:40.696
And he backed away from me.

51:40.698 --> 51:42.398
Collapsed.

51:45.235 --> 51:47.336
A few hours later,
he was dead.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.440
I'm so sorry, Caleb.

51:54.311 --> 51:56.245
And we keep some water
here in the house

51:56.247 --> 51:57.847
if you need any tonight.

51:57.849 --> 52:00.549
Easier than waking up and
walking out to the well, huh?

52:00.551 --> 52:01.884
Yeah, right.

52:05.555 --> 52:07.823
And up here is your room.

52:07.825 --> 52:10.359
- These pictures of you?
- Yeah, it's me.

52:10.361 --> 52:11.427
Bathroom.

52:11.429 --> 52:13.462
And this is you.

52:19.870 --> 52:23.639
Hmm.
Middle school football.

52:23.641 --> 52:25.508
Man, oh, man,

52:25.510 --> 52:27.676
I'd rather be in hell
with my back broke

52:27.678 --> 52:29.645
than be back there again.

52:29.647 --> 52:31.380
Well, I'll...

52:31.382 --> 52:34.150
I'll clear away all this stuff
in the morning.

52:34.152 --> 52:36.519
No, don't.

52:36.521 --> 52:38.487
I like it like this.

52:38.489 --> 52:40.422
I won't be here long.

52:44.861 --> 52:46.896
What are you doing?

52:46.898 --> 52:48.430
What do you mean?

52:48.432 --> 52:49.899
We don't know anything
about this guy.

52:49.901 --> 52:51.734
Could be anybody
for all we know.

52:51.736 --> 52:54.270
I was just
showing him his room.

52:54.272 --> 52:55.938
John, you wanted him to stay.

52:55.940 --> 52:57.873
No, no, no, no,
you invited him into the house.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.375
You cooked him dinner.

52:59.377 --> 53:02.444
You set him up
down the hall from us.

53:02.446 --> 53:03.779
You know what?
I mean,

53:03.781 --> 53:07.383
it's not like
he's a bad man.

53:07.385 --> 53:09.418
Right? I mean...

53:09.420 --> 53:10.819
You really believe that?

53:10.821 --> 53:13.222
I don't know
what to think yet.

53:14.925 --> 53:17.927
You never told me
about that boy in the wagon.

53:17.929 --> 53:19.495
Look, I don't want to...

53:19.497 --> 53:22.798
I don't want to
talk about that, okay?

53:22.800 --> 53:24.900
Well, I wish you would.

53:29.239 --> 53:32.274
Truth is, I don't think
you'd understand.

53:34.311 --> 53:37.913
Why wouldn't I understand?

53:37.915 --> 53:40.649
I lived through this too,
remember?

53:46.957 --> 53:50.526
Know how I said I was gonna
plant the fields

53:50.528 --> 53:52.561
back before summer?

53:54.331 --> 53:58.400
I actually started to,
and then just...

53:58.402 --> 54:00.836
thought
I wouldn't even bother.

54:05.508 --> 54:07.843
I mean, I'm sure what...

54:07.845 --> 54:10.279
What you went through
out there was horrible.

54:10.281 --> 54:12.281
I'm...

54:12.283 --> 54:14.850
But it... I mean,
it wasn't...

54:14.852 --> 54:17.720
Wasn't... easy here.

54:23.293 --> 54:27.463
I kept... I kept this calendar

54:27.465 --> 54:30.399
for the first few months
after they left.

54:34.804 --> 54:39.508
And then after awhile,
I just realized it didn't...

54:39.510 --> 54:42.911
it didn't matter.
They weren't coming back.

54:44.848 --> 54:48.450
Just seemed stupid.

54:48.452 --> 54:49.885
I stopped...

54:49.887 --> 54:53.455
Stopped thinking about
how many days were going by.

54:53.457 --> 54:56.992
I just was really sick
of being on my own, you know?

54:56.994 --> 54:59.862
I just didn't want
to be on my own anymore.

55:08.571 --> 55:11.040
What I'm saying
is that you come

55:11.042 --> 55:13.709
and made me want to
go through it all again.

55:13.711 --> 55:16.745
And not just somebody.

55:16.747 --> 55:18.013
You.

55:41.671 --> 55:43.772
I killed him.

55:46.643 --> 55:48.644
The boy.

55:48.646 --> 55:51.580
I think it was your brother.

55:53.850 --> 55:56.552
I don't know.

55:56.554 --> 55:58.520
Looked like him.

56:10.967 --> 56:13.502
I'm sorry.

56:18.575 --> 56:20.409
I'm sorry.

56:26.916 --> 56:28.884
It's okay.

56:55.612 --> 56:58.714
So we got kale down there,

56:58.716 --> 57:01.717
soybeans up by the house.

57:01.719 --> 57:06.121
Round here, there's cucumber,
tomato, squash,

57:06.123 --> 57:08.991
milk from the cows,
obviously, and eggs

57:08.993 --> 57:11.727
and occasionally meat
from the chickens.

57:17.133 --> 57:19.868
She seems older
than she is, huh?

57:22.872 --> 57:25.207
Yeah.

57:30.147 --> 57:34.516
You know what you also got?
Turkey.

57:34.518 --> 57:36.852
You hungry, Mr. Loomis?

57:38.688 --> 57:40.088
- Oh!
- Damn it.

57:40.090 --> 57:41.857
Just missed.

57:41.859 --> 57:43.692
- So what's your plan?
- Early on,

57:43.694 --> 57:45.894
when the radio stations
were still broadcasting,

57:45.896 --> 57:48.764
there was talk about a lot
of people heading south.

57:48.766 --> 57:51.166
Well, there was plenty
of old recordings

57:51.168 --> 57:52.835
looping over and over
on the EBS...

57:52.837 --> 57:54.603
Yeah, we heard all those.
We could tell the difference.

57:54.605 --> 57:57.005
No, you most certainly misheard.

57:57.007 --> 57:58.707
I mean,
the ancillary fallout?

57:58.709 --> 58:00.909
- Especially in the south...
- No, Mr. Loomis.

58:00.911 --> 58:03.178
Mr. Loomis, it's a town
called Anson near the Gulf.

58:03.180 --> 58:05.113
- There's no one left out there.
- The guy on the radio said

58:05.115 --> 58:06.682
there're about three dozen,
all family of military.

58:06.684 --> 58:08.116
You were military, right,
Mr. Loomis?

58:08.118 --> 58:10.486
- I was a civil contractor.
- Shh.

58:19.262 --> 58:23.232
You fancy a wager
on which one of us bags him?

58:23.234 --> 58:26.935
All right.
What do we stake?

58:30.607 --> 58:31.807
Ann.

58:35.813 --> 58:37.546
I'm joking, Mr. Loomis.

58:37.548 --> 58:39.715
For bragging rights is all.

58:52.228 --> 58:54.162
So you're gonna put
the platform down there?

58:54.164 --> 58:55.664
Mm-hmm.

58:55.666 --> 58:58.100
Water's radioactive,
but we got the suit.

58:58.102 --> 59:00.202
Put the wheel on the platform
to stabilize it,

59:00.204 --> 59:02.037
then we get some kind of...

59:02.039 --> 59:04.540
Some kind of race to divert
the water into the buckets

59:04.542 --> 59:07.709
and spin it fast enough
to power the generator.

59:07.711 --> 59:09.845
And you know how to do all that?

59:09.847 --> 59:11.713
Yeah.

59:11.715 --> 59:14.683
See, we don't need Anson.

59:14.685 --> 59:17.185
We could be Anson.

59:18.688 --> 59:20.122
It's pretty cool,
Mr. Loomis.

59:20.124 --> 59:22.558
So why haven't you started
building it yet?

59:22.560 --> 59:24.593
Well, the issue
is the raw materials.

59:24.595 --> 59:26.628
Ann has a sentimental
attachment to her church.

59:26.630 --> 59:28.664
Father was the pastor there.

59:28.666 --> 59:30.933
I don't know.
She says she's okay with it,

59:30.935 --> 59:33.095
but I didn't want to upset her.

59:56.292 --> 59:58.293
Good shot.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:07.169
Okay, who's gonna carve it?

01:00:07.171 --> 01:00:10.005
Mr. Loomis should.
He shot it.

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:13.241
All right.

01:00:16.946 --> 01:00:19.147
So that's
your daddy's chapel?

01:00:19.149 --> 01:00:20.649
Mm-hmm.

01:00:20.651 --> 01:00:23.218
Well,
he'd say it's God's chapel

01:00:23.220 --> 01:00:25.253
and he just works there.

01:00:25.255 --> 01:00:27.356
Mr. Loomis says
you have to tear it down

01:00:27.358 --> 01:00:29.124
to build
his water project up.

01:00:29.126 --> 01:00:31.893
That's not what I said.

01:00:31.895 --> 01:00:34.262
I said we didn't have
to do the water project,

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.732
at least not right away.

01:00:38.101 --> 01:00:39.368
Hmm.

01:00:41.037 --> 01:00:42.838
Ann,
you probably want to wait.

01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:46.208
Well, you know,
rebuilding's important.

01:00:46.210 --> 01:00:48.310
I think we should plan for it.

01:00:52.348 --> 01:00:54.816
Well, I'm confused now.

01:00:54.818 --> 01:00:56.718
You sound like Mr. Loomis.

01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:58.353
Excuse me?

01:00:58.355 --> 01:01:00.889
It's just a project.

01:01:00.891 --> 01:01:03.025
It'll happen when
it needs to happen, okay?

01:01:03.027 --> 01:01:05.894
I mean, we have wood
coming out of our ears here

01:01:05.896 --> 01:01:07.896
- with the trees and...
- Ann...

01:01:07.898 --> 01:01:09.931
there's no way
to cut the trees.

01:01:09.933 --> 01:01:11.933
I'm sure we can come up
with a way to take them down.

01:01:11.935 --> 01:01:13.268
- Don't you think?
- No, it's...

01:01:13.270 --> 01:01:14.970
It's not even
the taking them down.

01:01:14.972 --> 01:01:16.304
It's the milling them
that's the problem.

01:01:16.306 --> 01:01:18.140
Would you ever
consider another building?

01:01:18.142 --> 01:01:20.275
- Maybe one not so near to her?
- We had this conversation.

01:01:20.277 --> 01:01:22.377
We had this conversation.
There's not another building.

01:01:22.379 --> 01:01:24.379
You want to drop it now?

01:01:26.249 --> 01:01:27.315
Hmm.

01:01:31.721 --> 01:01:34.022
I guess the...
It's the only way.

01:01:35.725 --> 01:01:38.260
Yeah, guess so.

01:01:40.363 --> 01:01:42.698
Well, let's get to it then.

01:01:42.700 --> 01:01:44.266
Ha.

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.836
Ann?

01:01:51.174 --> 01:01:53.842
Yeah.

01:01:53.844 --> 01:01:57.212
Sure. Why not?

01:02:16.165 --> 01:02:17.866
All right!

01:02:19.035 --> 01:02:20.302
Ho!

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.343
Come on,
lift it up, Mr. Loomis!

01:02:28.345 --> 01:02:30.378
A little more...
That's good.

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.789
I saw that.

01:03:14.792 --> 01:03:16.091
I meant to do that.

01:03:16.093 --> 01:03:18.260
No, you didn't.

01:03:18.262 --> 01:03:21.062
Yes, I did.

01:04:18.588 --> 01:04:23.024
We should get a tarp.

01:04:23.026 --> 01:04:26.394
At least until we know
what we want to do with it.

01:04:26.396 --> 01:04:29.064
Would you like to take a walk?

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.369
Yeah, my daddy

01:04:34.371 --> 01:04:36.571
- ...dabbled in preaching too.
- Oh, yeah?

01:04:36.573 --> 01:04:39.241
I think he liked the women
and liquor more, though.

01:04:39.243 --> 01:04:43.311
I went from going to church
every day to never going at all.

01:04:43.313 --> 01:04:46.581
But, uh...
it'll never leave you.

01:04:48.451 --> 01:04:51.219
Why were you okay
with taking the chapel down?

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:54.155
I know why John was.
I mean...

01:04:54.157 --> 01:04:56.057
he's not religious, but...

01:04:56.059 --> 01:04:58.093
That church...

01:04:58.095 --> 01:05:01.029
It was only holy because of
what you brought to it.

01:05:03.232 --> 01:05:06.301
That can't be taken down.

01:05:06.303 --> 01:05:08.503
That's a nice way
of looking at it.

01:05:08.505 --> 01:05:10.171
That's the truth.

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.342
Thank you.

01:05:16.479 --> 01:05:19.080
Do you talk about
your belief with Mr. Loomis?

01:05:19.082 --> 01:05:20.615
No.

01:05:22.551 --> 01:05:25.287
He doesn't, like, try to
make me stop or anything.

01:05:25.289 --> 01:05:28.556
It's just... just not something
that we share.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:32.494
But that's okay.

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:37.532
And what does he say
about what happened out there?

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:40.068
Oh, you know, just...

01:05:42.438 --> 01:05:45.006
You haven't really talked
about it?

01:05:45.008 --> 01:05:47.175
Well, not really, no.

01:05:47.177 --> 01:05:49.210
What do you think?

01:05:55.051 --> 01:06:00.355
I think He has a plan...

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:03.325
and all three of us
are part of it somehow.

01:06:03.327 --> 01:06:06.494
But it was us believers,
don't you think?

01:06:09.365 --> 01:06:11.433
Just like this valley...
Why it survived,

01:06:11.435 --> 01:06:14.369
why you and I did...
Because we have faith.

01:06:14.371 --> 01:06:17.505
What if you
don't have faith?

01:06:17.507 --> 01:06:20.342
You have to.

01:06:20.344 --> 01:06:22.310
Not everybody does.

01:06:22.312 --> 01:06:25.113
You have to.

01:06:25.115 --> 01:06:27.595
It's the only way
you'll survive.

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:37.559
Hey!

01:06:37.561 --> 01:06:39.661
Look at this!

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:44.265
Well, it sure
looks like a wheel.

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:47.002
John, it's amazing.

01:06:47.004 --> 01:06:49.070
It's gonna work.

01:07:02.051 --> 01:07:03.618
Hey.

01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:05.453
Yeah, um... I wanted to

01:07:05.455 --> 01:07:07.322
talk to you about something.
Come here.

01:07:07.324 --> 01:07:09.257
Okay.

01:07:10.727 --> 01:07:12.494
So, um,

01:07:12.496 --> 01:07:15.530
how do I say this?

01:07:15.532 --> 01:07:19.734
I've seen the way that you and
Caleb look at each other, okay?

01:07:19.736 --> 01:07:25.807
And, um, I wanted you to know
that it's okay, all right?

01:07:25.809 --> 01:07:27.776
- I don't want...
- What do you mean?

01:07:27.778 --> 01:07:29.244
No, no, no, no, no, no,

01:07:29.246 --> 01:07:31.413
I wanted to tell you
I'm fine, okay?

01:07:31.415 --> 01:07:32.714
I'm good with it.

01:07:32.716 --> 01:07:36.351
You got to...
You got to explore, okay?

01:07:36.353 --> 01:07:38.353
I don't feel
the need to explore.

01:07:38.355 --> 01:07:40.422
I'm not gonna stand
in your way is what I'm saying,

01:07:40.424 --> 01:07:42.524
- okay?
- What?

01:07:42.526 --> 01:07:44.826
Why are you saying this?

01:07:44.828 --> 01:07:46.461
Because I...

01:07:46.463 --> 01:07:48.363
Because I went
for a walk with him today?

01:07:48.365 --> 01:07:50.198
It has nothing
to do with the walk.

01:07:50.200 --> 01:07:52.634
If you need to figure it out,
figure it out.

01:07:52.636 --> 01:07:54.502
I don't have anything
I need to figure out.

01:07:54.504 --> 01:07:58.339
I'm just letting you know
it's fine, okay?

01:07:58.341 --> 01:07:59.507
It's fine.
It's good.

01:07:59.509 --> 01:08:01.076
You all be white people
together.

01:08:01.078 --> 01:08:03.211
That's fine, okay?

01:08:52.895 --> 01:08:54.796
Thank you.

01:09:02.505 --> 01:09:05.473
He tell you
about that town, Anson?

01:09:05.475 --> 01:09:08.276
Yeah, by the Gulf.
Do you believe him?

01:09:08.278 --> 01:09:10.745
No, I don't see
how that could be possible.

01:10:05.435 --> 01:10:07.535
Good work.

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.571
To work.

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.242
Tell you the number
on your head?

01:10:14.244 --> 01:10:16.411
Right, you have to guess.

01:10:16.413 --> 01:10:19.314
What card is on my head?

01:10:19.316 --> 01:10:21.416
I think it's the 7 of Hearts.

01:10:21.418 --> 01:10:23.251
Oh!

01:10:23.253 --> 01:10:25.653
No, wait, never mind...
That wasn't right.

01:10:27.891 --> 01:10:29.991
What's the other one?
That may be... kick.

01:10:34.831 --> 01:10:36.664
Oh, sure, it's just
easy like that.

01:10:36.666 --> 01:10:38.600
Yeah, like that.

01:10:38.602 --> 01:10:41.436
I don't know
what to do with my arms.

01:11:06.563 --> 01:11:08.029
Y'all want to play a game?

01:11:08.031 --> 01:11:09.631
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

01:11:09.633 --> 01:11:12.900
All right, each of us
has to find the bottle.

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:14.662
- All right.
- All right?

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:20.041
Find the bottle.

01:11:22.379 --> 01:11:24.345
Who's going first?

01:11:24.347 --> 01:11:26.547
Mr. Loomis?

01:11:26.549 --> 01:11:28.816
I don't know...
I don't know if I can.

01:11:28.818 --> 01:11:31.919
You can do it.
Come on, John.

01:11:31.921 --> 01:11:33.488
Come on!

01:11:33.490 --> 01:11:35.056
- All right. Bye!
- Go!

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:49.437
I can't... I can't find it.

01:11:50.739 --> 01:11:52.507
Your turn, Ann.

01:12:04.620 --> 01:12:07.322
I found the bottle,
but I...

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:09.524
I dropped it coming back up.

01:12:09.526 --> 01:12:11.559
I don't believe you.

01:12:11.561 --> 01:12:12.960
- I did!
- Come on!

01:12:12.962 --> 01:12:15.029
- I did!
- You got to go again.

01:12:15.031 --> 01:12:16.898
I'll check on you.
Come on.

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.676
I'm getting cold.

01:13:09.585 --> 01:13:11.686
Let's go in.

01:13:17.459 --> 01:13:19.694
Ann?

01:13:19.696 --> 01:13:21.129
Ann.

01:13:24.133 --> 01:13:25.500
Hey.

01:13:33.108 --> 01:13:35.410
I love you.

01:13:38.715 --> 01:13:41.816
- Really?
- I do.

01:13:41.818 --> 01:13:43.951
I do.

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:20.988
John?

01:14:20.990 --> 01:14:23.558
Hmm.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:25.226
John?

01:16:42.331 --> 01:16:44.231
Hey.

01:17:05.287 --> 01:17:07.154
Caleb up yet?

01:17:07.156 --> 01:17:09.357
I don't know.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.742
Mr. Loomis.

01:17:27.744 --> 01:17:29.110
Caleb.

01:17:29.112 --> 01:17:30.845
Oh, and y'all still
even have coffee

01:17:30.847 --> 01:17:32.813
- for the hangovers.
- That's right.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.219
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:17:52.401 --> 01:17:53.834
Y'all get started.

01:17:53.836 --> 01:17:56.237
I'm just gonna go
to the restroom.

01:18:03.979 --> 01:18:06.881
It's a beautiful day.

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:16.290
Amen.

01:18:22.030 --> 01:18:24.031
What's on the agenda?

01:18:30.439 --> 01:18:33.708
Hey, man,
I'm all yours.

01:18:33.710 --> 01:18:38.212
Whatever you need from me,
put me to work.

01:18:38.214 --> 01:18:41.048
Well, let me see.

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:44.185
I need to put the finishing
touches on the wheel.

01:18:44.187 --> 01:18:45.986
Mm.

01:18:45.988 --> 01:18:47.455
Take it down to the creek.

01:18:47.457 --> 01:18:50.424
Let's get started
straight after breakfast.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:08.309
Caleb,

01:19:08.311 --> 01:19:11.445
I got to say something.

01:19:11.447 --> 01:19:14.415
She's a special girl.

01:19:14.417 --> 01:19:16.383
She sure is, sir.

01:19:16.385 --> 01:19:18.886
It's funny.
It took you...

01:19:18.888 --> 01:19:21.355
to make me realize that.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:27.495
You wish I'd never come?

01:19:32.534 --> 01:19:35.136
No.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.871
If you weren't here,

01:19:36.873 --> 01:19:40.174
we wouldn't be so close
to finishing the wheel,

01:19:40.176 --> 01:19:42.536
moving forward,
getting electricity.

01:19:51.019 --> 01:19:54.555
Truth is, though,

01:19:54.557 --> 01:19:57.958
you were never
a threat to me, Caleb.

01:19:57.960 --> 01:20:01.061
I mean, I...

01:20:01.063 --> 01:20:03.397
I told Ann to do
whatever was necessary

01:20:03.399 --> 01:20:06.167
to keep you from leaving.

01:20:11.039 --> 01:20:13.107
All right.

01:20:21.583 --> 01:20:23.517
It's funny?

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:28.956
Oh, I don't believe you, sir.

01:20:28.958 --> 01:20:31.158
Jealousy doesn't suit you.

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:35.963
What about Anson?

01:20:35.965 --> 01:20:37.565
I don't know, sir.

01:20:37.567 --> 01:20:42.536
Like you said, there's probably
nothing down there anyway.

01:21:07.063 --> 01:21:08.329
Yeah!

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:13.334
Yeah!

01:21:13.336 --> 01:21:14.935
Whoo!

01:21:47.402 --> 01:21:49.536
You good?

01:21:49.538 --> 01:21:51.205
You good?

01:21:51.207 --> 01:21:54.308
Yeah, we're good.

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:07.021
- Hey!
- Ah!

01:22:07.023 --> 01:22:11.025
Hey! Uhh...

01:22:43.058 --> 01:22:45.192
Hey.

01:22:49.164 --> 01:22:52.166
Wanna have a drink
with me, please?

01:22:52.168 --> 01:22:55.035
No, I'm fine.

01:22:55.037 --> 01:22:56.303
John.

01:23:00.041 --> 01:23:02.076
I'm sorry.

01:23:06.648 --> 01:23:09.149
I don't know
how any of this happened.

01:23:09.151 --> 01:23:10.617
It just...

01:23:10.619 --> 01:23:13.020
- It's okay.
- No, we're... it's...

01:23:13.022 --> 01:23:14.321
It's not okay.

01:23:14.323 --> 01:23:17.491
It's not.
I want to talk about it.

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:26.734
I... it was... it was...

01:23:26.736 --> 01:23:28.335
It was a really confusing night.

01:23:28.337 --> 01:23:31.105
I didn't...
That's not an excuse.

01:23:31.107 --> 01:23:32.106
I'm just saying that...

01:23:32.108 --> 01:23:36.677
He's gone, Ann.

01:23:36.679 --> 01:23:38.712
Caleb.

01:23:41.649 --> 01:23:43.717
He left.

01:23:48.189 --> 01:23:49.623
Left where?

01:23:49.625 --> 01:23:52.126
To Anson.

01:23:55.430 --> 01:23:57.731
Took the safe suit.

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:03.237
Said you were welcome
to anything of his.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:08.742
- Oh...
- I'm sorry.
