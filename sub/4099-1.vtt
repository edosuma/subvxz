<i>Before my father died,
he said the worst thing about growing old</i>

00:43.127 --> 00:46.756
<i>was that other men stopped
seeing you as dangerous.</i>

00:46.923 --> 00:52.345
<i>I've always remembered that, how being
dangerous was sacred, a badge of honor.</i>

00:54.013 --> 00:56.891
<i>You live your life by a code, an ethos.</i>

00:57.058 --> 01:02.939
<i>Every man does. It's your shoreline.
It's what guides you home.</i>

01:03.106 --> 01:06.651
<i>And, trust me,
you're always trying to get home.</i>

02:14.469 --> 02:16.721
<i>Authorities say
the ring is centered in Costa Rica,</i>

02:16.888 --> 02:18.389
<i>with the primary export being...</i>

02:46.501 --> 02:48.878
<i>...widely unknown if
the war on drugs is connecting them...</i>

02:58.513 --> 03:00.932
<i>...in the region
have been known to retaliate using a...</i>

03:07.897 --> 03:09.190
<i>...25, 000 troops...</i>

03:21.244 --> 03:22.954
<i>...flying from the US to control that...</i>

03:36.884 --> 03:38.594
Can we get some ice cream?

03:38.761 --> 03:41.264
- No, we gotta go.
- You always say no.

03:41.431 --> 03:44.392
- Well, are you gonna buy?
- No, you buy.

03:44.559 --> 03:45.977
OK, what are we getting today?

03:46.144 --> 03:49.439
- Passion fruit.
- OK, passion fruit.

03:51.983 --> 03:53.276
How about macadamia nut?

04:26.309 --> 04:27.935
<i>...claimed responsibility for the attack</i>

04:28.102 --> 04:29.896
<i>at the International School in Manila.</i>

04:30.062 --> 04:31.564
<i>Your father was a reader.</i>

04:31.731 --> 04:35.860
<i>Churchill, of course, but also Faulkner
and books about Tecumseh.</i>

04:36.027 --> 04:39.864
<i>He loved artists who painted people
with bodies that looked like boxes.</i>

04:40.031 --> 04:41.824
<i>I'd give him hell about that.</i>

04:41.991 --> 04:43.826
<i>He'd just say,
"You gotta look harder."</i>

04:52.835 --> 04:55.630
<i>Ambassador Margullies had long
been a strong supporter</i>

04:55.797 --> 04:59.008
<i>of joint counterterrorism operations
conducted within this region.</i>

04:59.175 --> 05:02.887
<i>Not one group has yet claimed responsibility
for the attacks on the International School.</i>

05:03.054 --> 05:04.806
- Here's your coffee, Rorke.
- Thank you, ma'am.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.891
- How's it going?
- Hey, you want the usual?

05:07.058 --> 05:09.352
- Sounds good, thank you.
- You're late again, Dave.

05:10.895 --> 05:12.563
I didn't say anything.

05:12.730 --> 05:14.857
What do you got
going on over here?

05:19.320 --> 05:22.573
- Are you serious, man?
- We're not telling anyone yet.

05:22.740 --> 05:24.158
You a little nervous, though, huh?

05:24.325 --> 05:25.743
Last time I checked,
they don't come with directions.

05:25.910 --> 05:27.370
Yeah, tell me about it.

05:27.537 --> 05:28.454
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:28.621 --> 05:30.331
My man here is having a baby.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.750
Hey, congratulations.

05:32.917 --> 05:34.877
Hey, everybody,
Rorke's having a baby.

05:35.044 --> 05:36.629
Congratulations, Rorke!

05:36.796 --> 05:38.381
- Whoo!

05:38.548 --> 05:41.300
- What did I just say?
- Ah, don't worry about it, man.

05:41.467 --> 05:45.388
You're gonna be awesome. I'm so excited
for you, man. You're gonna be a good dad.

05:45.555 --> 05:48.516
Hey, tomorrow Jackie and I
are heading down to the beach.

05:48.683 --> 05:51.853
Bring Sandy and the kids.
I'll bring an extra board for you.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.063
- You know I don't surf.
- I know you don't surf, but it'll be good

05:54.230 --> 05:55.523
- to get the families together.
- All right.

05:55.690 --> 05:59.277
But now that you've told everyone in the
bar, try and contain yourself tomorrow.

06:00.111 --> 06:01.362
I will try.

06:09.745 --> 06:12.248
<i>"Look harder,"
your father would say.</i>

06:12.415 --> 06:15.960
<i>I always knew he wasn't just ta/king
about those boxy abstract paintings.</i>

06:17.795 --> 06:21.799
<i>There's threats everywhere,
and the world is draped in camouflage.</i>

06:43.988 --> 06:46.616
Huh?

07:22.234 --> 07:24.654
Hey, I'll be right down, all right?

07:26.155 --> 07:27.448
Whatever you say, Boss.

07:30.451 --> 07:31.535
How was the ride?

07:31.702 --> 07:33.162
I left Colombia this morning.

07:33.329 --> 07:37.208
- Colombia to here in one day?
- Piece of cake.

07:37.375 --> 07:39.418
Anyway, estimates say
that Christo is worth

07:39.585 --> 07:41.796
close to a billion.
- That's with a "B"?

07:41.963 --> 07:44.298
Yeah, and he gives back a lot
to this community over here

07:44.465 --> 07:48.010
with medical clinics,
schools, political donations,

07:48.177 --> 07:49.553
you name it, so this is the deal:

07:49.720 --> 07:51.555
They are extremely
loyal to him over here.

07:51.722 --> 07:54.183
When did the DEA hand him over to us?

07:54.350 --> 07:57.937
When they intercepted a 707 of his
filled with Soviet weapons.

07:58.104 --> 08:00.398
Listen, Langley says that
the boys over at NSA,

08:00.564 --> 08:03.401
they found some interesting
intercepts connecting Christo

08:03.567 --> 08:06.028
to a jihadist network
out of Southeast Asia.

08:06.195 --> 08:09.240
Apparently, Christo and one
of the guys running the network,

08:09.407 --> 08:10.825
they're childhood friends.

08:16.080 --> 08:18.124
<i>Your father's
grandfather gave up his life</i>

08:18.290 --> 08:20.835
<i>flying a B-24 in World War II.</i>

08:21.002 --> 08:24.046
<i>He kept the Liberator aloft
just long enough for everyone to jump,</i>

08:24.213 --> 08:26.424
<i>and then he went down
with the plane.</i>

08:26.590 --> 08:28.634
<i>That's the blood
that courses in your veins.</i>

08:29.885 --> 08:32.929
- Daddy, can I come with you?
- You want to come with me?

08:33.097 --> 08:35.850
Did you feel how cold it is out there?
I'll tell you what,

08:36.017 --> 08:38.644
go hang out with Mommy for a little while,
help out with the baby.

08:38.811 --> 08:41.688
When I come back in, if you still want
to go out, I'll take you out with me.

08:41.856 --> 08:44.775
- Promise?
- I promise. Hurry up, go.

08:50.573 --> 08:52.575
- What's going on, sir?
- What's up, brother?

08:52.742 --> 08:55.786
- Nothing much, man.
- Now, I know you got the New York heritage,

08:55.953 --> 08:58.289
but this isn't exactly like
sitting back in Staten Island.

08:58.456 --> 09:00.416
You got to actually work hard
to get through the surf.

09:00.583 --> 09:02.001
- Yeah, I know.
- Twelve-plus years on the Teams,

09:02.168 --> 09:03.377
and you don't know
how to do this?

09:03.544 --> 09:05.379
Hey, wait till you
have five kids, man.

09:05.546 --> 09:07.423
You'll see how much time
you got to play in the surf.

09:07.590 --> 09:09.175
You ready to get
in the drink or what?

09:09.341 --> 09:10.634
All right, man, lead the way.

09:10.801 --> 09:12.678
- All right, don't embarrass us.
- All right.

09:12.845 --> 09:16.932
<i>Your father was my Boss,
and I was his Chief.</i>

09:17.099 --> 09:20.895
<i>What we knew about each other
strengthened our bond as operators.</i>

09:21.062 --> 09:24.190
<i>There was a brotherhood between us,</i>

09:24.356 --> 09:27.151
<i>and we depended on each other
more than a family.</i>

09:31.572 --> 09:34.784
<i>Tecumseh said,
"Although a single twig will break,</i>

09:34.950 --> 09:37.078
<i>a bundle of twigs is strong."</i>

09:46.545 --> 09:48.422
OK, OK, <i>gracias.</i>

09:48.589 --> 09:50.716
Wow, this is unbelievable.

09:50.883 --> 09:52.927
I still can't believe you
ordered Chinese in this place.

09:53.094 --> 09:55.387
It's really good.

10:03.604 --> 10:06.190
Double word score, 18 points.

10:08.317 --> 10:11.695
- "Dumb"?
- Read it and weep, sugar.

10:15.908 --> 10:17.451
I'll try not to.

10:18.536 --> 10:21.705
Look at this, look at this.
Thirty-eight points for me.

10:21.872 --> 10:23.999
"Adumbrating,"
that's not even a word.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.293
OK, first of all,
it's pronounced "adumbrating,"

10:26.460 --> 10:29.088
and it means pretending,
foreshadowing.

10:30.506 --> 10:32.216
- Hm...

10:32.383 --> 10:34.718
Guess who's buying dinner
tonight, sugar.

10:38.597 --> 10:40.724
Fine.

10:40.891 --> 10:44.228
In most cases,
officers get tactical partners.

10:44.395 --> 10:48.023
Langley sets me up
with some sort of SCRABBLE hustler.

10:48.190 --> 10:51.068
SCRABBLE Yoda, OK?
Get it right.

10:53.779 --> 10:55.281
- How much do I owe you?
- Nada.

10:57.408 --> 10:59.785
- Shit.

11:43.829 --> 11:46.582
<i>Our platoon
was headed downrange.</i>

11:47.917 --> 11:49.543
<i>We had Weimy, our sniper.</i>

11:49.710 --> 11:52.671
<i>He grew up in the middle
of the Mojave Desert.</i>

11:52.838 --> 11:55.507
<i>Most excitement he found
as a kid was bowling frozen turkeys</i>

11:55.674 --> 11:57.968
<i>down the aisle at the grocery store.</i>

11:59.511 --> 12:02.514
<i>Ray, our comms guy, our radioman,</i>

12:02.681 --> 12:05.267
<i>he grew up in East LA gang/and.</i>

12:05.434 --> 12:09.730
<i>He had a Silver Star for pulling
a wounded teammate out of the fray.</i>

12:09.897 --> 12:12.650
<i>Sonny, he was made of granite.</i>

12:12.816 --> 12:14.652
<i>This guy didn't even do push-ups</i>

12:14.818 --> 12:17.947
<i>'cause he was afraid his chest
was gonna get too big.</i>

12:18.113 --> 12:21.325
<i>Ajay joined the Teams
late in his 30s.</i>

12:21.492 --> 12:23.702
<i>He'd been a Muay Thai fighter
early in life.</i>

12:23.869 --> 12:26.997
<i>Before that, he grew up
dirt-poor in Trinidad.</i>

12:28.999 --> 12:31.252
<i>Mikey had 20 years in the Teams.</i>

12:31.418 --> 12:34.004
<i>But as humble as he was,
you'd never even know it.</i>

12:34.171 --> 12:38.384
<i>He kept a picture of his wife in his he/met
and a lock of her hair in his pocket.</i>

12:38.550 --> 12:40.427
<i>Quiet as the breeze.</i>

12:41.470 --> 12:43.097
<i>And finally, Senior Chief.</i>

12:43.264 --> 12:45.683
<i>I couldn't really
tell you much about him...</i>

12:45.849 --> 12:48.185
<i>...other than I'd rather
take a knife into a gunfight</i>

12:48.352 --> 12:50.020
<i>than have to be interrogated by him.</i>

12:53.816 --> 12:55.609
<i>That last night at home,</i>

12:55.776 --> 12:58.028
<i>you think about how you could
have been a better dad,</i>

12:58.195 --> 13:00.030
<i>a better husband.</i>

13:00.197 --> 13:04.034
<i>That bedtime story you should have read
or that anniversary you forgot.</i>

13:04.201 --> 13:06.954
<i>You don't expect your family
to understand what you're doing,</i>

13:07.121 --> 13:08.872
<i>you just hope they'll accept it.</i>

13:09.039 --> 13:12.960
<i>When you get home, you hope you
can pick up right where you left off.</i>

13:13.127 --> 13:15.587
- What up?

13:15.754 --> 13:18.882
- You putting the wild bunch down?
- Yeah, yeah.

13:19.049 --> 13:22.636
Hey, Senior, you mind giving
us a couple minutes, man?

13:22.803 --> 13:25.055
- Nah, you got 'em, Jefe.
- Thanks.

13:26.974 --> 13:28.600
Hey, fellas, you know
I only got so many speeches

13:28.767 --> 13:31.895
in a given work-up or
deployment, but, uh...

13:32.062 --> 13:35.774
...it's like Chief and I said right
at the beginning of this platoon:

13:35.941 --> 13:39.528
Once we step off on campaign, once this
bird's ready and we're downrange,

13:39.695 --> 13:41.989
everything back home
needs to be in balance.

13:42.156 --> 13:43.866
<i>We're not gonna be worth a damn
to each other or ourselves</i>

13:44.033 --> 13:45.701
<i>if we get over there
and something's out of whack.</i>

13:45.868 --> 13:47.703
<i>I mean, if things
aren't right with the family,</i>

13:47.870 --> 13:50.664
<i>things aren't right with the finances
or something's off,</i>

13:50.831 --> 13:54.084
<i>it's gonna put us all out of balance, so we
need to have that tight before we launch.</i>

13:54.251 --> 13:56.086
<i>If somebody's got an issue,
bring it up.</i>

13:56.253 --> 13:59.298
<i>Chief can take care of it, I can take care
of it. Everybody's got each other's back.</i>

13:59.465 --> 14:02.092
<i>Let's make sure we lock that down
so when we're ready to roll,</i>

14:02.259 --> 14:04.261
<i>all our focus is on the mission.</i>

14:06.347 --> 14:08.640
<i>For all those
who have been downrange,</i>

14:08.807 --> 14:12.227
to us and those like us,
damn few.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.271
- Cheers.
- Hear, hear.

14:24.782 --> 14:26.158
I still like the name James.

14:26.325 --> 14:28.994
I'll think about it,
if it's a boy.

14:30.371 --> 14:31.372
Come here.

14:39.838 --> 14:42.716
- I'm proud of you.
- Thanks, baby.

14:45.302 --> 14:49.014
Hey, little one, you make sure
you keep Mama away from Aunt Carol.

14:49.181 --> 14:51.183
I don't like that
chain-smoking at all.

14:51.350 --> 14:52.768
I got it, Lieutenant.

14:52.935 --> 14:54.311
- OK.
- It's gonna be OK.

14:54.478 --> 14:57.523
- All right.
- It's gonna be fine.

15:03.070 --> 15:05.489
Try to keep this as long
as you can for a while, yeah?

15:05.656 --> 15:06.990
Anything else, Commander?

15:07.157 --> 15:12.121
Yeah. I'd like to be able to look into
your eyes when our first child is born.

15:12.287 --> 15:14.331
You know I'll do my best.

15:21.338 --> 15:23.215
I love you, baby.

15:27.386 --> 15:28.554
Love you.

15:34.101 --> 15:36.186
<i>War is a country of will.</i>

15:36.353 --> 15:38.522
<i>There's no room for sympathy.</i>

15:38.689 --> 15:43.360
<i>If you're not willing to give up
everything, you've already lost.</i>

16:13.515 --> 16:15.350
Tell me, what is it
about you Americans that makes

16:15.517 --> 16:18.061
you feel entitled to fuck
with the way I make my living?

16:31.700 --> 16:34.620
I know who you are, Miss Morales,
and I know who you work for.

16:34.786 --> 16:37.122
<i>So why don't you
save us both some time</i>

16:37.289 --> 16:39.625
<i>and tell me exactly
what you think you know?</i>

16:56.183 --> 16:59.353
<i>How did that feel,
Miss Morales?</i>

16:59.520 --> 17:01.897
<i>Have a great day at the spa.</i>

17:13.575 --> 17:15.493
<i>Sí, jefe.</i>

17:39.309 --> 17:40.769
- Hey, fellas, what's up?
- Hey.

17:40.936 --> 17:43.772
It's hotter than two rats screwing
in a wool sock out there, yeah?

17:43.939 --> 17:45.983
Africa-hot...
Tarzan couldn't take this heat.

17:46.149 --> 17:47.985
Anyway, here's the deal.
Time to get your frogman on.

17:48.151 --> 17:50.404
Lights. Three days ago,

17:50.571 --> 17:53.532
two CIA agents, a Walter Ross
and a Miss Lisa Morales,

17:53.699 --> 17:56.577
were ambushed inside their
hotel room here in Costa Rica

17:56.743 --> 17:58.870
by a unknown amount
of heavily armed assholes.

17:59.037 --> 18:02.916
Unfortunately, Mr. Ross was murdered,
and Miss Morales has been abducted.

18:03.083 --> 18:05.127
We believe that this has been the work

18:05.294 --> 18:07.838
of a guy named Mikhail Troykavitch,
aka Christo.

18:08.005 --> 18:09.965
LT's going to give you
the skinny on him.

18:10.132 --> 18:13.760
Thanks, Senior.
Mikhail Troykavitch, aka Christo.

18:13.927 --> 18:16.847
This guy is believed to have been
working cocaine-for-weapons deals

18:17.014 --> 18:20.559
between the Russian mafia, the FARC
guerrillas, and the Mexican drug cartels

18:20.726 --> 18:22.519
ever since the late 1990s.

18:22.686 --> 18:26.189
Now, before she was captured,
Morales was working a possible link

18:26.356 --> 18:30.110
between our boy Christo
and this guy Abu Shabal.

18:30.277 --> 18:32.529
<i>Glory to Allah,
Lord of the worlds,</i>

18:32.696 --> 18:34.323
<i>who has created us as Muslims</i>

18:34.489 --> 18:37.659
<i>and delivered us with the jihad
on his direct path.</i>

18:37.826 --> 18:42.331
<i>Peace be upon those who follow his
direct path till the Day of Judgment.</i>

18:42.497 --> 18:45.208
<i>Let me explain this to you Americans.</i>

18:45.375 --> 18:47.085
<i>We are not separatists.</i>

18:47.252 --> 18:50.213
<i>We Chechens are not
a legal part of anyone,</i>

18:50.380 --> 18:54.926
<i>but you Americans are willingly
or unwillingly assisting</i>

18:55.093 --> 18:59.806
<i>in the genocide of our people
by demanding that we obey certain rules,</i>

18:59.973 --> 19:04.394
<i>and by your continued
occupation of all Muslim countries.</i>

19:04.561 --> 19:08.357
<i>With the grace of Allah,
glorious and exalted is he,</i>

19:08.523 --> 19:14.363
<i>America will never be safe
until safety becomes a reality for us.</i>

19:14.529 --> 19:16.657
<i>Allahu Akbar.</i>

19:16.823 --> 19:18.909
Abu Shabal is
a Chechen terrorist

19:19.076 --> 19:21.411
who's associated with
the Beslan School Massacre.

19:21.578 --> 19:25.582
He's been jumping between training camps
in Indonesia and the Philippines.

19:25.749 --> 19:29.252
Now, the connection between Christo
and Abu Shabal is still a little bit fuzzy,

19:29.419 --> 19:32.089
but if this was the lead
that Morales was working on,

19:32.255 --> 19:34.675
it could be why
she was abducted. Senior?

19:34.841 --> 19:37.552
All right, this is a personnel
recovery of Miss Morales.

19:38.762 --> 19:40.347
All right, who's got questions?

19:40.514 --> 19:42.766
Senior Chief, you got
any updated source intel

19:42.933 --> 19:45.602
on numbers inside the camp,
and what about roving patrols?

19:45.769 --> 19:48.689
Maybe eight to ten, bro, but we don't
know anything about roving patrols.

19:48.855 --> 19:50.524
You're just gonna have to assume
that they're out there

19:50.691 --> 19:52.776
walking around, squared away.
They do this for a living, too.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.278
Senior, what kind of weapons-on-target
are we looking at?

19:55.445 --> 19:57.572
Heavy weapons.
These guys are narco-traffickers,

19:57.739 --> 19:59.825
so they can have anything
from Soviet-bloc DShKs.

19:59.991 --> 20:02.744
They could have M2HP,
.50-cals out there, we don't know.

20:02.911 --> 20:06.039
So if there is a weapons' emplacement up
there, I suggest you guys bring rockets.

20:06.206 --> 20:09.751
Of course, rockets and foliage don't match,
so make sure you got a clear shot.

20:09.918 --> 20:13.588
- All right, what else?
- Any idea whether she's ambulatory or not?

20:13.755 --> 20:15.298
There was a ton of blood on the scene,

20:15.465 --> 20:17.884
and a lot of it was Mr. Ross',
we confirmed that.

20:18.051 --> 20:21.096
Miss Morales may have bled there, too,
but these guys are savages,

20:21.263 --> 20:23.807
so you're gonna have to assume
that she is non-ambulatory,

20:23.974 --> 20:26.268
so you're gonna have
to bring stuff to carry her out.

20:29.813 --> 20:31.815
<i>Two minutes to drop.</i>

20:44.035 --> 20:46.621
Hey, LT.

20:46.788 --> 20:50.000
You got to let us know who that guy is,
so when we get back, we can kick his ass.

20:50.167 --> 20:52.043
What guy?

20:52.210 --> 20:54.713
The guy that gave you
that fucked-up haircut.

20:57.591 --> 20:59.050
- Fuck.
- Damn, Sonny,

20:59.217 --> 21:02.304
you should be the last guy to talk.
You look like the Dominican Mr. Clean.

21:02.471 --> 21:05.474
That means my head
shines like your gold teeth, huh?

21:05.640 --> 21:07.768
- Don't be like that,

21:07.934 --> 21:08.769
- that's harsh.
- Ramp!

21:10.771 --> 21:12.522
Mask up.

21:15.650 --> 21:19.821
Man, I tell you what. The only thing better
than this right here is being a dad,

21:19.988 --> 21:22.491
except for that whole
changing diaper thing, but...

21:22.657 --> 21:24.743
...Sandy does that for me anyway, so...

21:24.910 --> 21:26.703
I'm actually looking forward to it.

21:28.789 --> 21:31.374
<i>Blackbeard, green light in ten.</i>

21:35.337 --> 21:36.671
<i>Five.</i>

24:08.740 --> 24:12.118
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,
this is Blackbeard Actual.

24:12.285 --> 24:13.745
Radio check. Over.

24:18.291 --> 24:22.879
Blackbeard Main, Blackbeard Main,
this is Blackbeard Actual. Over.

24:25.340 --> 24:26.967
<i>Roger, Actual. This is Main.</i>

24:27.133 --> 24:30.804
<i>- We have you Lima Charlie.</i>
- Roger, Main.

24:30.971 --> 24:34.474
All boots are on the ground.
I pass T-bird.

24:34.641 --> 24:38.186
Any traffic for my station
at this time?

24:38.353 --> 24:41.189
<i>Actual,
imagery picked up an increase in traffic</i>

24:41.356 --> 24:44.067
<i>at secondary location,
known to be enemy QRF,</i>

24:44.234 --> 24:46.152
<i>eight clicks from primary target.</i>

<i>The SWCC boats will insert

24:48.989 --> 24:51.741
<i>- How copy?</i>
- Roger, Main.

25:01.960 --> 25:03.920
- You ready?
- Roger that, sir.

25:04.087 --> 25:07.090
We got about 4.7 clicks
at three-five-five.

25:10.635 --> 25:11.636
Take it out.

25:38.079 --> 25:40.081
Whiplash, one minute out.

25:51.301 --> 25:52.677
Thirty seconds.

25:55.930 --> 25:57.265
Ten by ten.

25:59.142 --> 26:00.351
Whiplash, go.

26:12.363 --> 26:13.948
All boots on deck.

Line secure.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.973
Whiplash, Bucket One and Two are out.

27:17.220 --> 27:20.765
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
Radio check. Over.

27:20.932 --> 27:23.977
Blackbeard, it's Whiplash.
Have you loud and clear.

27:24.144 --> 27:25.603
Standing by on the set.

27:26.521 --> 27:29.357
Roger, Whiplash.
What is your ETA to my pos?

27:29.524 --> 27:31.317
<i>ETA 20 mikes.</i>

27:31.484 --> 27:35.363
Be advised, Raven is in flight
and pushing to your location.

28:05.768 --> 28:07.437
- No!

28:07.604 --> 28:09.105
No!

28:11.691 --> 28:13.318
Hey, sir, we gotta go.

28:20.283 --> 28:22.202
Roger. Take it out.

28:22.368 --> 28:25.205
I feel like we're pretty thin.
I'd like to take you guys with us.

28:25.371 --> 28:29.125
Chief, I got a SBT coming up on-step.
I got a Raven pushing my pos.

28:29.292 --> 28:30.710
Weimy and I are
in good overwatch position,

28:30.877 --> 28:32.795
and I got to keep reporting
back to Blackbeard Main.

28:32.962 --> 28:34.881
- We're staying here.
- Roger that.

28:47.644 --> 28:50.271
- Keep it tight.
Got it.

29:17.715 --> 29:22.053
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard. Assault
force is moving to the target early.

29:22.220 --> 29:25.098
Request immediate fire support.

29:25.265 --> 29:27.767
Blackbeard, it's Whiplash. Good copy.

29:27.934 --> 29:31.771
Requesting fire support.
Pushing to your location in 15 mikes.

29:57.005 --> 29:59.841
Whiplash, this is Blackbeard.
I have positive control of the Raven.

31:08.576 --> 31:10.244
Chief, are you set?

31:27.261 --> 31:28.346
<i>Chief, Chief, hold it.</i>

31:32.016 --> 31:33.559
One o'clock, base of the tower.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.019
- Got him.

31:37.230 --> 31:38.898
<i>You're clear to the door.</i>

32:51.721 --> 32:53.431
I've got two squirters
coming out the back door.

33:16.996 --> 33:17.997
Going in!

33:22.668 --> 33:24.754
- Clear!
- All clear!

33:27.423 --> 33:29.675
Weimy, eleven o'clock.
Driver's side, truck.

33:30.968 --> 33:32.637
- Got him.

33:37.016 --> 33:39.268
- Fuck.

33:47.985 --> 33:49.403
- Come on.
- Go in! Go in!

33:54.242 --> 33:56.118
- Clear!
- All clear!

33:56.285 --> 33:59.455
- Target's secure.
- Chief, I'm going to get Mikey.

34:11.634 --> 34:14.469
LT, this is Chief.
Target is secure.

34:14.637 --> 34:17.431
Stand by for confirmation
of the package.

34:17.598 --> 34:21.978
Be advised Mikey is down.
Mikey is down. Status to follow.

34:22.143 --> 34:23.853
Roger. You have the package.

34:32.405 --> 34:34.657
Chief, I got his cell phone.

34:41.455 --> 34:42.748
LT? LT?

34:45.167 --> 34:47.920
Chief, looks like you have two aggressor
vehicles approaching from the north,

34:48.087 --> 34:51.257
<i>about one mike out. You can take
the truck outside the west door.</i>

34:51.424 --> 34:53.509
<i>Meet us at extract.</i>

34:53.676 --> 34:56.512
Miss Morales, I'm bringing you home.

34:56.679 --> 34:58.639
I just need to ask you a few questions.

35:00.141 --> 35:02.518
What's your mother's maiden name?

35:04.895 --> 35:06.355
Rosales.

35:06.522 --> 35:08.482
What street you were born on?

35:09.317 --> 35:11.402
Hot Springs.

35:11.569 --> 35:15.031
All right. Just hang on.

35:15.948 --> 35:18.409
Whiplash, we have enemy QRF
approaching from the north.

35:18.576 --> 35:22.413
Roger. You have enemy QRF
coming in from the north.

35:22.580 --> 35:24.665
Chief, you need to start your exfil now.

35:24.832 --> 35:27.376
<i>- We'll meet you at secondary extract.
- Roger that.</i>

35:27.543 --> 35:29.253
Hey, boys, we gotta roll!

35:30.379 --> 35:31.589
Shit. Sir, it's those trucks,

35:31.756 --> 35:33.174
about 1,000 yards.
- Yep.

35:33.341 --> 35:35.092
Ma'am, I'm taking you out right now.

35:35.259 --> 35:38.596
Hey, Chief, he took a round to the eye
with the exit wound behind the ear.

35:38.763 --> 35:41.057
He's alive, but we gotta get moving now!

35:41.849 --> 35:43.601
Weimy, coming out.

35:43.768 --> 35:45.353
We'll meet you at the rally point.

35:48.356 --> 35:50.399
Let's go! Let's go! Move it!

35:58.824 --> 36:00.743
- Heads up! Fast movement on the left!
- Right turn! Right turn!

36:08.501 --> 36:10.503
Hey, man, we're not going
to make it to secondary extract.

36:10.670 --> 36:12.546
I got to find us a route.
Stay on this road.

36:12.713 --> 36:15.591
- Left, left, left.
- Left turn! Left turn!

36:15.758 --> 36:17.134
Mikey, come on, buddy.

36:19.011 --> 36:20.346
Hey, Chief!

36:22.056 --> 36:24.266
We're not gonna make secondary extract!

36:24.433 --> 36:27.269
- You're gonna have to figure it out, man!
- Hold on!

36:27.436 --> 36:29.397
Come on. Stay with me.
Stay with me.

36:31.107 --> 36:32.149
Stay with us.

36:32.316 --> 36:35.194
Come on, Mike. Wake up.
Wake up. Come on, man.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.450
- Contact!
- Pick it up, pick it up.

36:41.617 --> 36:44.078
Yo, Chief!
We can make it to rally point!

36:44.245 --> 36:47.540
- Sounds good! Pass it to LT!
- Come on, man.

36:48.666 --> 36:52.545
LT, LT, this is assault team.
We just lost the secondary extract.

36:52.712 --> 36:55.131
I say again, we just lost
secondary extract.

36:55.297 --> 36:56.841
Moving to rally point.
How copy, over?

37:00.261 --> 37:01.929
- We're about a click out.
- Mikey, wake up.

37:02.888 --> 37:03.889
One click out!

37:11.814 --> 37:13.899
Let's go, Mike.
Wake up. Come on, buddy.

37:14.066 --> 37:16.485
Come on, Mikey! Wake up!

37:29.373 --> 37:31.083
- Good?
- Backstage clear.

37:32.626 --> 37:33.919
- Rocket out!

37:48.684 --> 37:51.645
- He's not breathing!

37:51.812 --> 37:53.606
- Breathe, Mikey!
- We're up! We're up!

37:58.110 --> 38:00.112
Chief, let me get your M-4!

38:01.822 --> 38:03.699
Sir, what's the status
on those boats?

38:03.866 --> 38:05.576
I lost Whiplash on the run.

38:05.743 --> 38:08.662
Told 'em you hit the target early.
They're coming in hot.

38:08.829 --> 38:11.874
- Roger that.
- Fuck! Take this, man.

38:12.041 --> 38:13.209
Breathe, Mikey. Come on, Mikey.

38:13.375 --> 38:15.419
- I got no pulse.
- Contact rear!

38:15.586 --> 38:16.587
Contact rear!

38:18.464 --> 38:19.840
- Holy shit!

38:20.007 --> 38:21.008
Taking rounds in...

38:25.387 --> 38:26.222
Pick it up. Pick it up.

38:51.622 --> 38:54.959
Ajay! QRF coming up the rear!

39:01.131 --> 39:04.218
Whiplash! Whiplash!
Secondary extract is burnt.

39:04.385 --> 39:06.053
Moving to tertiary extract.

39:06.220 --> 39:09.139
I have eight packs,
seven Sierras, one package.

39:09.306 --> 39:10.558
<i>Package with multiple wounds.</i>

39:10.724 --> 39:13.143
<i>The Sierra has gunshot wound
to the head.</i>

39:13.310 --> 39:15.396
This will be a hot extract.

39:21.777 --> 39:23.153
What the fuck?!

39:23.320 --> 39:24.905
- Oh, shit!
- Mikey, stay down!

39:25.072 --> 39:27.157
- Keep him down, man!
- Where the fuck am I?!

39:27.324 --> 39:30.077
- Calm down, brother.
- Mikey's up, man. Mikey's up.

39:30.244 --> 39:33.205
Stay down, brother. Calm.
Be easy. We're almost out of here.

39:33.372 --> 39:34.456
We're almost out of here.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.560
- Mikey!

39:54.727 --> 39:56.186
- Hang on, buddy.
- Where are we?

39:56.353 --> 39:58.063
- We're on our way to extract.
- What happened?

39:58.230 --> 39:59.857
You're good to go.
You took one to the face, man.

40:00.024 --> 40:01.108
You're a hard motherfucker.

40:01.275 --> 40:02.401
- Did we get her?
- Yes.

40:02.568 --> 40:03.861
- Oh, my God.
- We're on our way to extract.

40:04.028 --> 40:06.405
- Ajay, splash it. Splash it.

40:06.572 --> 40:09.658
Water! Water! Water!

40:12.411 --> 40:14.663
Going in! Going in!

40:16.665 --> 40:17.708
I got her! I got her!

40:17.875 --> 40:19.001
It's fucking going under.

40:19.168 --> 40:20.836
Out! Get the fuck out!

41:14.515 --> 41:16.016
It wasn't for nothing.

46:26.576 --> 46:28.245
You know, from time to time,

46:28.412 --> 46:32.207
I get to see my old friends
from my old life.

46:34.084 --> 46:36.086
And it's always, always disappointing.

46:38.547 --> 46:41.133
Some become assholes,
other boring,

46:41.300 --> 46:44.303
and I can't believe I tried to get them
in bed all those years ago.

46:48.598 --> 46:50.434
Hey.

46:50.600 --> 46:52.853
It is nice not to be disappointed, Yuri.

46:56.231 --> 46:59.735
- That's not my name.
- I know.

46:59.901 --> 47:03.238
Mohammed Abu Shabal,
the son of Shabal.

47:03.405 --> 47:06.199
Come on.
Your father's name is Yevgeny.

47:07.242 --> 47:08.577
Things change.

47:09.619 --> 47:11.204
Yeah, things have changed.

47:12.372 --> 47:15.625
That's why this is the last time we might
have to see each other for quite some time.

47:15.792 --> 47:18.920
Forl might have
to find a hole to hide in.

47:22.049 --> 47:23.508
I don't understand.

47:24.676 --> 47:28.597
I'm being watched by the CIA,
and I'm not taking any chances.

47:28.764 --> 47:32.434
As soon as the opportunity presents itself,
I'm taking my family south.

47:32.601 --> 47:34.770
I neither have the energy or the will
to fight the Americans.

47:34.936 --> 47:37.606
What about our deal, Mikhail?

47:37.773 --> 47:40.192
My men have been training
for almost a year now.

47:40.359 --> 47:43.320
- I have devoted much of my resources...
- The deal stands, Yuri.

47:43.487 --> 47:45.655
Just because I've taken
early retirement does not mean

47:45.822 --> 47:47.115
I'm not holding up
my end of the bargain.

47:47.282 --> 47:48.283
There is so much to be done.

47:48.450 --> 47:51.203
And it will be, just without me.

47:51.370 --> 47:52.913
You'll have to use
my trusted associates.

47:53.080 --> 47:54.790
That's not so good for me.

47:54.956 --> 47:56.208
- Hey...
- Hey! Shut up!

47:57.084 --> 47:58.043
Shut up!

47:58.210 --> 48:00.587
Stop your fucking bullshit!

48:00.754 --> 48:03.548
It's not good. Doesn't work.
You can't change it like that.

48:03.715 --> 48:06.551
- Nothing changes. Nothing.
- You just told me everything's changed.

48:06.927 --> 48:08.428
What... What is that?
What is that?

48:08.595 --> 48:10.472
Do you know what I do to get here?!

48:10.639 --> 48:13.100
Do you know the men who I've
had to sacrifice to get here?!

48:13.266 --> 48:15.560
Do you have any idea?!

48:15.727 --> 48:17.813
No, you shit! You live up here
in this ivory tower!

48:17.979 --> 48:19.981
You have no... You don't care!

48:37.749 --> 48:40.335
Hey, Chief, what's the status on Mikey?

48:40.502 --> 48:45.048
He's definitely gonna lose the eye,
but he's... he's hanging tough.

48:46.758 --> 48:48.677
Hey, I'm gonna get right into this.

48:48.844 --> 48:51.346
Great job smoke-checking those
assholes and getting Morales back.

48:51.513 --> 48:54.516
It's a bum deal for Mikey, but I gotta
tell you what, that was solid work.

48:54.683 --> 48:56.685
So, Chief, you make sure you get
that down to the boys right away.

48:56.852 --> 48:58.019
- You hear me?
- Check.

48:58.186 --> 49:01.982
All right. Now, Morales,
Morales was one tough chick,

49:02.149 --> 49:04.484
but she should've gotten
the stuff up the chain a lot faster

49:04.651 --> 49:06.820
because this thing is way
bigger than we thought it was.

49:06.987 --> 49:10.240
How is that? I thought this was
a cut-and-dry AMCIT recovery.

49:10.407 --> 49:13.827
Yeah, it was until we got into that phone
that you guys picked up in that shithole.

49:13.994 --> 49:16.621
It turned me on to something
that just does not look right at all.

49:16.788 --> 49:19.708
- And what's not right about it?
- Christo and Shabal are a lot closer

49:19.875 --> 49:22.544
than I thought they were,
and Shabal is a wild card, man.

49:22.711 --> 49:26.423
He is an old-school jihadi that couldn't
give a rat's ass about money or drugs.

49:26.590 --> 49:28.717
Yeah, and his childhood friend,
Christo, the dope dealer?

49:28.884 --> 49:32.262
He is not a dealer, man.
He's a smuggler.

49:32.429 --> 49:35.724
- You have got to be kidding me.
- That is exactly what I'm thinking.

49:35.891 --> 49:37.559
Shabal wants to kill Americans.

49:37.726 --> 49:40.896
Christo knows how to get
fuckers inside America.

49:41.062 --> 49:43.356
This could be big trouble
in little China, fellas.

49:43.523 --> 49:45.025
They're gonna hit us at home.

49:46.943 --> 49:49.529
I just got done talking to the boss
and the Spec Ops Task Force,

49:49.696 --> 49:51.031
and this is what's gonna go down.

49:51.198 --> 49:53.950
I need Ajay and Ray standing by
to launch for an SR in two hours.

49:54.117 --> 49:56.411
They're gonna get some
frequent flyer miles on the way to Africa.

49:56.578 --> 49:57.954
Why Africa?

49:58.121 --> 50:00.415
We pinned an airfield there
with that phone that you got,

50:00.582 --> 50:04.628
and I think that Shabal is gonna be there
doing a weapons transfer on his way west.

50:04.794 --> 50:07.380
When you say "west," what are
we talking about, Mexico west?

50:07.547 --> 50:11.885
Yeah, Mexico west.
That's worst-case scenario.

50:12.052 --> 50:13.970
You two and the rest of the platoon
are gonna stay here on standby.

50:14.137 --> 50:17.390
You'll be the primary assault force in case
something goes down anywhere near America.

50:17.557 --> 50:19.351
- Check.
- Check.

50:19.518 --> 50:21.478
You gonna be around for
any questions as they come up?

50:21.645 --> 50:25.941
No, man. Christo... he pulled a Roman
Polanski on my ass and disappeared.

50:26.107 --> 50:27.943
So I'm gonna link up
with SEAL Team Four,

50:28.109 --> 50:30.320
and we're gonna go hunt his ass
down in the South Pacific.

50:30.487 --> 50:32.948
So it's straight up Mai Tais
and palm trees for me, baby.

50:33.114 --> 50:34.074
Yeah, brother. Go get him.

50:34.241 --> 50:35.450
- You be cool.
- Take it easy.

50:35.617 --> 50:37.619
Good luck with that baby, Lieutenant.

50:39.746 --> 50:42.123
- Does everybody know?
- Only the important people.

50:42.290 --> 50:44.668
The important people to who? You?

50:44.834 --> 50:47.462
- I guess so.

50:47.629 --> 50:50.590
- I'm gonna go brief the boys.
- Hey, hold on one second.

50:52.175 --> 50:54.219
Hey, brother, I've never
written one of these before.

50:55.512 --> 50:58.056
Hey, I'm tracking with you, sir. I am.

50:58.223 --> 50:59.808
But, to be honest with you,

50:59.975 --> 51:03.228
I was thinking of calling the command
and trying to get you home.

51:03.395 --> 51:08.149
But now that work's picked up so much,
I feel like we really need you here.

51:09.484 --> 51:11.027
You remember our
last cruise to Al Anbar?

51:11.194 --> 51:13.029
- Yeah.
- When you had that final

51:13.196 --> 51:15.615
turnover op, and you said
I didn't need to be there?

51:15.782 --> 51:19.244
I was laying in bed and I realized the only
thing I needed to do now was go home.

51:19.411 --> 51:22.080
But if something went south on your op,

51:22.247 --> 51:24.374
I would always regret
not being there with you.

51:24.541 --> 51:27.002
I appreciate you taking care
of me big-time, Dave,

51:27.168 --> 51:28.837
but I'm working some things
with the brass.

51:29.004 --> 51:32.882
If I can, and things slow down,
I'm gonna get two weeks off.

51:33.049 --> 51:36.177
Well, I hope it works out
either way. I really do.

51:36.344 --> 51:39.556
But, if it doesn't,
I'm gonna take this piece of paper,

51:39.723 --> 51:41.516
and I'm gonna make it
into a nice paper airplane.

51:41.683 --> 51:44.644
Beat it.

52:38.156 --> 52:40.033
We're good, we're good!

52:49.501 --> 52:51.503
Chief of the Watch,
submerge the ship to one-six-zero feet.

52:51.670 --> 52:53.463
- Dive. Dive.

53:05.767 --> 53:08.436
Scope down.
All doors are green.

53:18.488 --> 53:20.115
- Oh, good. Hey, guys.
- Sir.

53:20.281 --> 53:21.616
- Thank you for getting here so fast.
- Sure.

53:21.783 --> 53:23.410
- Grab a seat, please.
- Thank you.

53:23.576 --> 53:25.120
You'll have Bulldog overhead.

53:25.286 --> 53:27.288
We need you to get in,
grab the intel

53:27.455 --> 53:30.458
and bounce it back to us.
Do you have any questions?

53:30.625 --> 53:33.294
Sir, I have a question.
We have the rally point and time.

53:33.461 --> 53:35.463
What if the meeting
doesn't take place as scheduled?

53:35.630 --> 53:37.882
How long do you
want us to stay on target?

53:38.049 --> 53:41.803
Now, this one counts, so I'd plan
on being out there for a while.

53:41.970 --> 53:44.139
- Check.
- Are we good?

53:44.305 --> 53:45.473
- Think so, sir.
- Yes, sir.

53:55.483 --> 53:59.154
Ray and Ajay are rigged up
and ready to check each other out.

54:00.280 --> 54:01.656
Garage door clear.

55:18.483 --> 55:19.984
- You got a visual?
- Yeah.

55:20.151 --> 55:22.028
Got three trucks moving in.

55:22.195 --> 55:26.157
A fuel truck, two jeeps,
some skinnies in the back.

55:26.324 --> 55:27.951
One of them has a .50-cal.

55:37.043 --> 55:39.254
- You hear that?

55:39.420 --> 55:41.589
- Yeah, I think that's our plane.
- Yeah, we got some inbound.

55:52.433 --> 55:55.937
'Bout time these guys showed up.
Jesus. Let me get my camera.

56:12.954 --> 56:15.832
Hey, Ray, we got two birds
down at the end of the field,

56:15.999 --> 56:21.087
southeast our pos, no tail IDs.

56:21.254 --> 56:23.882
- You got that?
- Check, no tail IDs.

56:33.099 --> 56:35.935
Ray, last time I checked,
we were in Africa, right?

56:36.102 --> 56:37.687
Yeah. Why, what's up?

56:39.355 --> 56:42.984
Dude, there's, like,
16 Filipinos down there,

56:43.151 --> 56:44.611
all praying to Mecca right now.

56:44.777 --> 56:47.572
- Filipinos?
- Filipinos. Definitely not skinnies.

56:47.739 --> 56:50.825
I'm picking up the praying.
I'm also picking up some Russian.

57:22.023 --> 57:25.693
Bulldog, Bulldog, Redrum,
radio check, over.

57:25.860 --> 57:28.154
<i>- Good check, copy.</i>
- Roger, good check.

57:28.321 --> 57:30.239
Be advised, we got two sterile aircraft

57:30.406 --> 57:34.118
departing to the east
from following location:

57:34.285 --> 57:37.163
<i>Ten, Papa, Lima, Sierra.</i>

57:37.330 --> 57:39.582
Please advise when tally target, over.

57:39.749 --> 57:43.211
<i>Roger.
Copy, two aircraft, location Ten, Papa...</i>

57:43.378 --> 57:46.881
Hey, Chief, you are
not gonna believe this.

57:47.048 --> 57:48.466
One of the planes Ray and Ajay tagged

57:48.633 --> 57:50.885
just landed on Cedros Island
off the coast of Mexico.

57:51.052 --> 57:54.055
It has Shabal on it with an
unknown number of jihadis.

57:54.222 --> 57:55.431
Are you kidding me?

57:55.598 --> 57:57.350
No, looks like we're gonna
get to hit that target.

57:57.517 --> 57:59.560
Well, Senior and the SWCC
boats are punching out.

57:59.727 --> 58:02.438
They should pull a little more
intel for us, so we'll see.

58:02.605 --> 58:04.065
All right.

58:31.134 --> 58:34.053
I don't know how long we're staying.
Hold on, baby.

58:39.517 --> 58:41.477
- Be safe.
<i>- You know I will.</i>

58:41.644 --> 58:44.105
<i>- I gotta go, honey.</i>
- I love you.

58:44.272 --> 58:46.107
I love you.

59:31.652 --> 59:33.446
<i>Bravo Alpha, we're 200 meters out.</i>

59:44.665 --> 59:46.667
<i>Bravo, you have a Tango
on your starboard side.</i>

59:46.834 --> 59:48.503
<i>Tango on the starboard side.</i>

59:56.803 --> 59:59.388
<i>Whiskey Charlie,
we have a visual on Tango.</i>

01:00:19.158 --> 01:00:21.410
<i>Bravo, you have a Viper at twelve o'clock.</i>

01:00:50.898 --> 01:00:52.233
Get down! Get down!

01:00:53.734 --> 01:00:56.237
Clear! Bridge secure.

01:00:57.864 --> 01:00:59.282
<i>Senior, you're clear.</i>

01:01:35.067 --> 01:01:37.653
- English OK? Let's do that.
- English is fine.

01:01:37.820 --> 01:01:39.530
Can you cut him loose, please?

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:41.699
If you get out loose, you're not
gonna do anything crazy, are you?

01:01:41.866 --> 01:01:45.036
- A Crazy Ivan? Soto speak.

01:01:45.203 --> 01:01:47.496
- So you're Russian, yeah?

01:01:47.663 --> 01:01:50.166
- Yes, I am.
- You all right?

01:01:50.333 --> 01:01:52.835
- Yes, I'm good. Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:01:53.002 --> 01:01:54.378
I'm sorry.
I don't know your name.

01:01:54.545 --> 01:01:55.588
- I'm Otto.
- Otto.

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:57.465
- Yes. And you are?
- Nice to meet you.

01:01:57.632 --> 01:01:58.674
Christo.

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:00.593
- Crisco?
- Christo.

01:02:01.719 --> 01:02:03.512
Troskawicz?

01:02:03.679 --> 01:02:05.640
So how long am I gonna need
to keep busting your balls

01:02:05.806 --> 01:02:07.934
about getting one of those patches?

01:02:08.100 --> 01:02:10.353
Ah, yeah, I think it was,
like, a one-time deal, man.

01:02:10.519 --> 01:02:13.356
After 9/11, my uncle sent
a bunch out for the platoon,

01:02:13.522 --> 01:02:16.484
but, uh, after this go-round,
I'll give it to you.

01:02:16.651 --> 01:02:18.486
No, no, I'm not gonna
take your family crest.

01:02:18.653 --> 01:02:21.155
All right, good.
I didn't want to give it to you anyway.

01:02:21.322 --> 01:02:23.157
Besides, man,
I'm pretty sure I saw you

01:02:23.324 --> 01:02:25.243
putting something in your
cargo pocket the other day.

01:02:25.409 --> 01:02:29.038
- What's that?
- I know I've seen you carrying

01:02:29.205 --> 01:02:30.915
something in that pocket right there.

01:02:32.458 --> 01:02:33.542
What is it?

01:02:34.835 --> 01:02:36.003
That's my grandfather's flag.

01:02:36.170 --> 01:02:37.755
- Nice.
- My pop gave it to me,

01:02:37.922 --> 01:02:39.548
and now I'm gonna
give it to my boy someday.

01:02:39.715 --> 01:02:41.717
All right. I like that.

01:02:51.644 --> 01:02:53.187
You're sitting on a wonderful boat.

01:02:53.354 --> 01:02:54.522
- It's fabulous.
- Thank you. Yes.

01:02:54.689 --> 01:02:56.983
- I believe it's called <i>Starship.</i>
<i>- "Starship".</i>

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:58.484
I love the way you say <i>Starship.</i>

01:02:58.651 --> 01:03:01.153
It's like Russian.
That guy, uh... <i>Star Trek.</i>

01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:03.406
What's his name, Scotty?
Oh, no, he was, sorry, Scott.

01:03:03.572 --> 01:03:05.908
- I wouldn't know.
- Yes. You've never seen <i>Star Trek?</i>

01:03:06.075 --> 01:03:07.743
- No.
- Oh, that's insane.

01:03:07.910 --> 01:03:09.370
- So here's the problem, pal.
- Mm-hm?

01:03:09.537 --> 01:03:11.580
You're worth a lot of money.

01:03:11.747 --> 01:03:14.917
- Or you were worth a lot of money.
- I believe I still am.

01:03:15.084 --> 01:03:16.210
- You do?
- Yes.

01:03:16.377 --> 01:03:20.089
All right. Let me tell you
how the world works there, Crisco.

01:03:20.256 --> 01:03:21.799
- It's Christo.
- Sorry?

01:03:21.966 --> 01:03:23.592
- Christo.
- Oh, of course. Sorry.

01:03:23.759 --> 01:03:25.011
It's OK.

01:03:25.177 --> 01:03:26.554
Let me tell you
how the world really works.

01:03:26.721 --> 01:03:27.930
- Please.
- This is no longer your boat.

01:03:28.097 --> 01:03:31.225
Since I walked through that door,
you're not the same guy you used to be.

01:03:31.392 --> 01:03:34.603
You're just not.
There's nothing I can do to stop that,

01:03:34.770 --> 01:03:37.732
nothing I can do to help you right now,
unless you let me help you.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:41.444
We need to do this together, pal.
You and me.

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:45.323
So how is it that you're working
with these jihadi folks, then?

01:03:47.074 --> 01:03:48.075
You're Jewish, right?

01:03:50.161 --> 01:03:52.246
Shabal is what?

01:03:54.623 --> 01:03:57.460
- You got a friend, like, you grew up with?
- Sorry?

01:03:57.626 --> 01:03:59.503
Have you ever had a friend
that you grew up with?

01:03:59.670 --> 01:04:01.881
- Yes.
- Had, like, played interests, played soccer,

01:04:02.048 --> 01:04:03.883
or... What would you play?
Baseball, probably, right?

01:04:04.050 --> 01:04:05.551
- Probably. Yeah.
- Yeah.

01:04:05.718 --> 01:04:07.053
And then you went
on your separate ways,

01:04:07.219 --> 01:04:10.014
and then some years later,
you meet up.

01:04:10.181 --> 01:04:13.601
And you totally
didn't recognize the person.

01:04:13.768 --> 01:04:15.770
And that's what happened with Shabal.

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.564
We share a common interest.

01:04:18.731 --> 01:04:22.943
So he came up with this incredible idea
because of his beliefs.

01:04:23.110 --> 01:04:27.406
I don't necessarily share his beliefs,
but he's a smart guy.

01:04:27.573 --> 01:04:29.575
You know, it's almost like...

01:04:29.742 --> 01:04:31.327
...you know, it's almost like...

01:04:31.494 --> 01:04:32.620
...like this is me.

01:04:38.459 --> 01:04:41.087
- And that's Shabal.
- Is it?

01:04:41.253 --> 01:04:43.214
- And America is in-between.
- Is it?

01:04:43.381 --> 01:04:44.423
Yeah.

01:04:45.966 --> 01:04:47.218
Cool concept, no?

01:04:47.385 --> 01:04:48.886
- Right here?
- Yes.

01:04:50.346 --> 01:04:52.390
You think this is some kind of game?

01:04:54.892 --> 01:04:56.852
- Do you? Do you find this amusing?
- No. No.

01:04:57.019 --> 01:04:58.979
- I'm not finding...
- Do you realize what you're doing here?

01:04:59.814 --> 01:05:02.191
<i>Blackbeard Actual,
this is Blackbeard Main.</i>

01:05:02.358 --> 01:05:04.693
Post nation counterpart.
Secured target Bravo.

01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.988
<i>Report to Tri-Hull.
You're clear to move on target Alpha.</i>

01:05:08.155 --> 01:05:10.825
<i>Roger, Main.
Clear to target.</i>

01:05:14.161 --> 01:05:17.415
The only people
I answer to is my family.

01:05:17.581 --> 01:05:19.834
To my wife and to my child.

01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:22.086
And nobody else.

01:05:22.253 --> 01:05:25.381
- Running late somewhere?
- Shit filter's full.

01:05:25.548 --> 01:05:26.715
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:05:26.882 --> 01:05:30.302
So here's the problem, pal.

01:05:30.469 --> 01:05:32.304
You do love your family, don't you?

01:05:33.472 --> 01:05:35.558
- Yes, I do.
- And what about your daughter?

01:05:35.724 --> 01:05:37.143
What about my daughter?

01:05:37.309 --> 01:05:39.145
Are you looking forward
to seeing her again?

01:05:39.311 --> 01:05:40.980
Every minute of my life.

01:06:03.836 --> 01:06:08.215
I wanted you to see that so that you'd
think about some things very seriously,

01:06:08.382 --> 01:06:10.926
because you're gonna be
sitting in a box somewhere.

01:06:11.093 --> 01:06:14.889
You'll be treated properly
and humanely.

01:06:16.557 --> 01:06:20.853
That girl is gonna grow up,
and she's gonna get married,

01:06:21.020 --> 01:06:24.231
and your wife is gonna find someone else,

01:06:24.398 --> 01:06:27.318
and you're gonna miss everything.

01:06:34.533 --> 01:06:37.953
If I had done something
that would endanger my family,

01:06:38.120 --> 01:06:40.247
I would feel just
like you do right now.

01:06:43.125 --> 01:06:45.044
You promise not
to touch my family?

01:06:45.211 --> 01:06:47.087
I would never touch your family.

01:06:48.422 --> 01:06:49.507
I would not.

01:06:56.722 --> 01:06:58.057
Are you familiar with...

01:07:00.434 --> 01:07:01.977
...ceramic ball bearings?

01:07:02.144 --> 01:07:03.521
No.

01:07:04.688 --> 01:07:06.899
Just imagine 16 suicide vests

01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:09.109
filled with those
ceramic ball bearings,

01:07:09.276 --> 01:07:13.781
slipping by every metal detector
and every checkpoint in your country.

01:07:15.366 --> 01:07:17.785
You think your economy
is fucked now?

01:07:19.245 --> 01:07:23.123
Just think what the media
is gonna do with this. Hm?

01:07:23.290 --> 01:07:26.627
It's gonna make 9/11 look like
a fucking walk in the park.

01:07:26.794 --> 01:07:28.712
The grand Central Park.

01:07:30.005 --> 01:07:31.757
So you're telling me...

01:07:32.925 --> 01:07:38.931
...there's 16 jihadis
wearing suicide vests.

01:07:39.265 --> 01:07:42.476
They're gonna walk
right across the border.

01:07:43.602 --> 01:07:45.145
So where are they going?

01:07:46.897 --> 01:07:49.775
San Diego, San Francisco, Houston...

01:07:49.942 --> 01:07:51.652
You pick a city, they'll be there.

01:07:51.819 --> 01:07:56.073
- And this is happening now?
- It's happening as we speak.

01:07:57.032 --> 01:07:58.325
Sorry, what?

01:07:59.410 --> 01:08:01.912
It's happening as we speak.

01:08:04.331 --> 01:08:06.208
How can you stop this?

01:08:08.669 --> 01:08:10.254
I can't.

01:10:00.406 --> 01:10:03.617
Blackbeard Lead,
containment element is set.

01:10:03.784 --> 01:10:04.952
Roger.

01:11:44.343 --> 01:11:45.969
Gun! Gun! Gun!

01:11:47.763 --> 01:11:49.973
- Clear!

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.099
- Go.
- Coming out!

01:11:55.354 --> 01:11:59.107
Rat Pack, this is Blackbeard. We're in
contact, midtown, south of the church.

01:12:08.700 --> 01:12:10.577
Contact!

01:12:25.092 --> 01:12:26.635
Contact!

01:12:30.138 --> 01:12:30.973
Changing!

01:12:37.145 --> 01:12:39.022
Blackbeard Lead, what's your pos?

01:12:39.189 --> 01:12:41.149
<i>Overwatch.
You're clear to engage.</i>

01:12:42.317 --> 01:12:43.360
Go in hot.

01:13:05.132 --> 01:13:06.675
Frag out!

01:13:16.018 --> 01:13:19.187
Weimy, I've got two squirters
heading south in a pickup truck.

01:13:23.942 --> 01:13:24.943
I see 'em.

01:13:29.323 --> 01:13:31.074
Hit those two guys in the truck.

01:13:52.262 --> 01:13:53.388
Rocket!

01:14:01.480 --> 01:14:02.731
Frag out!

01:15:02.791 --> 01:15:04.793
Sir? Sir?

01:15:04.960 --> 01:15:07.671
LT? You all right?

01:15:13.760 --> 01:15:14.761
Damn.

01:15:14.928 --> 01:15:16.722
You check that box, huh?

01:15:16.888 --> 01:15:18.181
Yeah.

01:15:20.058 --> 01:15:21.685
Good thing that was a dud.
I might've gotten hurt.

01:15:21.852 --> 01:15:24.980
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

01:15:27.274 --> 01:15:28.608
Jesus.

01:15:31.987 --> 01:15:35.198
This is not some bush-league
vest from an Iraqi hut.

01:15:35.365 --> 01:15:36.700
This is some high-speed shit.

01:15:38.160 --> 01:15:40.579
Maybe we should put this
somewhere else, huh?

01:15:48.545 --> 01:15:50.714
Hey, Sonny, find somewhere
to put this, would you?

01:15:57.512 --> 01:16:00.307
Target secure.
Set security.

01:16:00.474 --> 01:16:02.893
One's to the north, three south.

01:16:48.021 --> 01:16:49.397
Hey, Chief, target's buttoned up.

01:16:49.564 --> 01:16:51.566
- Everything's secure.
- Thanks, man.

01:16:51.733 --> 01:16:54.694
<i>Actual, mission
not complete. Stand by for follow-on.</i>

01:16:54.861 --> 01:16:56.696
You only got half that jihadist cell.

01:16:56.863 --> 01:17:00.033
- The target's secure, sir.
- This fight isn't over yet.

01:17:00.200 --> 01:17:03.036
Now, listen, the other half of that cell
is gonna be crossing the border

01:17:03.203 --> 01:17:06.540
using a tunnel network
from Mexicali at 0700.

01:17:06.706 --> 01:17:09.251
We're coordinating with State,
but for now the birds will drop you off

01:17:09.417 --> 01:17:12.712
outside the city where your POC
is a Commander Pedros.

01:17:12.879 --> 01:17:14.631
<i>I'll give you more details en route.</i>

01:17:14.798 --> 01:17:16.925
<i>- Actual, how do you copy?</i>
- Roger, Main.

01:17:17.092 --> 01:17:19.094
OK, we've got a helo
landing on the deck,

01:17:19.261 --> 01:17:21.388
we're gonna meet a Mexican
SOF commander and his team.

01:17:21.555 --> 01:17:24.391
They're gonna help infil us to
the target and join us on the assault.

01:17:25.642 --> 01:17:27.769
- What the hell are you talking about?
- We haven't got all of 'em yet, Chief.

01:17:27.936 --> 01:17:31.022
- And where's the rest of 'em?
- They're in Mexicali on the border.

01:17:31.189 --> 01:17:32.816
All right.
And the rest of the boys,

01:17:32.983 --> 01:17:34.109
how are they getting
back to the ship?

01:17:34.276 --> 01:17:35.569
<i>Bon Homme Richard</i>
stayed on station.

01:17:35.735 --> 01:17:37.654
They're gonna send in a Marine
element to help exploit the target.

01:17:37.821 --> 01:17:40.073
When they're done, the boys
will pull off with them.

01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.160
OK. I'm thinking Squad One
and myself roll out.

01:17:43.326 --> 01:17:45.036
Perfect. Squad Two
stays here, buttons it up,

01:17:45.203 --> 01:17:46.955
pulls out with the Marines.
- OK.

01:17:53.378 --> 01:17:55.172
We're moving north
of here through town,

01:17:55.338 --> 01:17:56.923
and crossing at sunrise.

01:17:57.090 --> 01:17:59.843
The other group will get
into Texas the following day,

01:18:00.010 --> 01:18:01.428
through Juarez.

01:18:02.721 --> 01:18:04.222
<i>Comprendes?</i>

01:18:16.109 --> 01:18:20.071
Hey, sir! Who the hell cleared us hot
to go to Mexicali anyway?

01:18:20.238 --> 01:18:22.449
This one's going all
the way up the flagpole.

01:18:22.616 --> 01:18:24.242
State Department's on it.

01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:05.825
Hey, sir. Channel two.

01:19:10.872 --> 01:19:12.624
Hey, this tempo keeps up like this,

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:15.335
Jackie's gonna be squeezing
that kid out on her own.

01:19:16.419 --> 01:19:20.924
However, we hit this target quick enough, you
jump on a burro and ride that shit home.

01:19:21.091 --> 01:19:24.594
Hey, I ain't gonna need no burro.

01:19:26.137 --> 01:19:27.472
Did you get your two weeks?

01:19:27.639 --> 01:19:29.891
All that time I was
spending on the sat phone,

01:19:30.058 --> 01:19:32.352
it wasn't to convince them
to let me go home,

01:19:32.519 --> 01:19:34.604
it was to convince them
to leave your ass in charge.

01:20:42.339 --> 01:20:44.466
- Sir.
- Lieutenant.

01:20:44.632 --> 01:20:46.760
Seems our governments have been
very busy to make this possible, huh?

01:20:46.926 --> 01:20:48.345
All the way to the top,
from what I hear.

01:20:48.511 --> 01:20:50.388
There is something
that you have to understand.

01:20:50.555 --> 01:20:54.351
My superiors, they're very
fearful of a Mexican Mogadishu.

01:20:54.517 --> 01:20:56.603
No <i>Black Hawk Down</i>
is what they're saying,

01:20:56.770 --> 01:20:58.355
so we do need
to stay under the radar.

01:20:58.521 --> 01:21:00.482
- I understand completely, sir.
- Good.

01:21:00.648 --> 01:21:03.485
Your team's presence here is greatly
appreciated, but we are out of time.

01:21:03.651 --> 01:21:05.153
- We need to move.
- Tell me where, we go.

01:21:05.320 --> 01:21:06.363
Help piece this together for me.

01:21:06.529 --> 01:21:07.822
- OK.
- Our intel says

01:21:07.989 --> 01:21:10.658
they're using a tunnel network
that is under a milk factory.

01:21:10.825 --> 01:21:12.786
This mean anything to you?

01:21:12.952 --> 01:21:15.372
I know exactly where that is.
It's not far from here.

01:21:15.538 --> 01:21:17.207
Then that's where we're going.

01:21:17.374 --> 01:21:19.167
Of all of the places in Mexicali

01:21:19.334 --> 01:21:21.336
that you could have picked,
this is probably the worst.

01:21:21.503 --> 01:21:23.505
The cartels control
that area from all angles.

01:21:23.671 --> 01:21:25.340
They have us heavily outgunned.

01:21:25.507 --> 01:21:27.717
Simply reaching your target
is gonna be very difficult.

01:21:27.884 --> 01:21:30.470
Sir, we have eight foreign nationals
heading to our country.

01:21:30.637 --> 01:21:32.972
Needless to say,
they are no big fan of ours.

01:21:33.139 --> 01:21:35.308
If they are at that factory,
that's where we're going.

01:21:35.475 --> 01:21:37.644
Lieutenant, I'll take you
anywhere you need to go,

01:21:37.811 --> 01:21:40.814
but prepare your men for a bigger fight
than what you had imagined.

01:21:40.980 --> 01:21:44.150
You're not fighting eight men. You're also
fighting the cartel that's protecting them.

01:21:44.317 --> 01:21:46.569
If your targets make it
into those tunnels,

01:21:46.736 --> 01:21:48.738
they'll disappear like ghosts.

01:23:31.132 --> 01:23:32.884
You enter the tunnels right here.

01:23:33.051 --> 01:23:35.178
You will walk
seven miles to this fork.

01:23:35.345 --> 01:23:36.930
My men will tell you
what tunnel to take.

01:23:37.096 --> 01:23:41.601
Once you get to this point,
my job is done.

01:23:41.768 --> 01:23:43.561
You're on your own.

01:24:12.215 --> 01:24:14.968
- Lieutenant, we're going now!
- Roger that.

01:24:36.698 --> 01:24:40.660
Chief, we're not stopping.
We're rolling up on target, hard.

01:24:40.827 --> 01:24:43.454
Roger that, sir.
We're about 30 seconds out.

01:24:57.927 --> 01:25:00.930
<i>One mike out
from the south entrance.</i>

01:25:35.882 --> 01:25:37.550
Jefe! On the roof!

01:25:49.228 --> 01:25:51.189
- We gotta go. Now.

01:26:23.471 --> 01:26:26.349
- Sir! Leave two men here!

01:26:55.086 --> 01:26:56.087
Weimy!

01:26:59.924 --> 01:27:00.925
Weimy!

01:27:02.135 --> 01:27:03.261
I need you
to lock this shit down!

01:27:12.061 --> 01:27:13.312
Frag out!

01:27:15.815 --> 01:27:17.024
On me.

01:27:42.842 --> 01:27:44.802
You guys got the gate!

01:27:44.969 --> 01:27:47.513
Call! You're going to the front door!

01:27:50.099 --> 01:27:51.642
Go!

01:28:18.961 --> 01:28:20.254
Call!

01:29:11.055 --> 01:29:12.265
Changing!

01:29:57.977 --> 01:30:00.479
Bomb!

01:30:53.032 --> 01:30:54.158
Damn it, sir.

01:30:54.325 --> 01:30:55.660
How you gonna explain
that one to my family?

01:30:55.826 --> 01:30:58.162
Get back there
so I don't have to, huh?

01:31:14.470 --> 01:31:15.721
Clear!

01:31:38.285 --> 01:31:40.538
Grenade!

01:32:38.596 --> 01:32:41.098
- LT!

01:32:44.769 --> 01:32:46.062
Chief, I got him.

01:33:09.043 --> 01:33:10.711
Keep going. I'll cover you.

01:34:58.068 --> 01:34:59.278
Chief.

01:35:03.866 --> 01:35:06.702
Chief!

01:35:09.288 --> 01:35:11.457
Assault Two,
this is Assault One.

01:35:11.624 --> 01:35:15.794
Be advised, tunnel is secure
and all threats are neutralized.

01:35:15.961 --> 01:35:18.130
LT and Chief are down.

01:35:18.297 --> 01:35:21.300
<i>I say again,
LT and Chief are down.</i>

01:36:17.856 --> 01:36:19.733
<i>Your father was a good man.</i>

01:36:19.900 --> 01:36:22.319
<i>Growing up without him
is gonna be hard.</i>

01:36:22.486 --> 01:36:24.488
<i>It's gonna hurt.</i>

01:36:24.655 --> 01:36:28.617
<i>You'll feel alone, out to sea,
with no shore in sight.</i>

01:36:28.784 --> 01:36:32.788
<i>You'll wonder,
"Why me? Why him?"</i>

01:36:44.425 --> 01:36:48.846
<i>Remember, you have
Warrior's blood in your veins.</i>

01:36:49.013 --> 01:36:51.932
<i>The code that made your father
who he was is the same code</i>

01:36:52.099 --> 01:36:55.853
<i>that'll make you a man
he would admire, respect.</i>

01:36:57.313 --> 01:37:00.649
<i>Put your pain in a box.
Lock it down.</i>

01:37:00.816 --> 01:37:03.861
<i>Like those people in the
paintings your father liked,</i>

01:37:04.028 --> 01:37:08.574
<i>we are men made up of boxes,
chambers of loss and triumph,</i>

01:37:08.741 --> 01:37:12.077
<i>of hurt and hope and love.</i>

01:37:13.203 --> 01:37:15.831
<i>- No one is stronger or more dangerous...</i>
- Ready!

01:37:15.998 --> 01:37:17.708
<i>- ...than a man who can harness his emotions.</i>
- Aim!

01:37:17.875 --> 01:37:20.252
<i>- His past.</i>

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:24.298
- Aim!

01:37:25.632 --> 01:37:27.885
- Aim!

01:37:30.346 --> 01:37:33.265
<i>Use it as fuel, as ammunition,</i>

01:37:33.432 --> 01:37:36.935
<i>as ink to write the most
important letter of your life.</i>

01:37:38.395 --> 01:37:41.440
On behalf of the President
of the United States

01:37:41.607 --> 01:37:45.736
and a grateful nation,
I present you this flag

01:37:45.903 --> 01:37:49.198
in recognition of your
husband's heroic achievements.

01:37:53.202 --> 01:37:55.704
You have my
deepest condolences.

01:38:00.542 --> 01:38:02.920
One more flag to present.

01:38:03.087 --> 01:38:05.464
This one I think you know.

01:38:06.965 --> 01:38:11.136
On every deployment,
Rorke carried this with him.

01:38:15.140 --> 01:38:17.643
Again, my deepest condolences.

01:38:26.485 --> 01:38:29.113
Lieutenant Engel!

01:38:29.279 --> 01:38:31.907
Hoo-yah, Lieutenant Engel!

01:39:37.556 --> 01:39:41.768
<i>Before he died, your father asked me
to give you this poem by Tecumseh.</i>

01:39:41.935 --> 01:39:44.897
<i>I told him I'd fold it
into a paper airplane.</i>

01:39:45.063 --> 01:39:47.816
<i>And, in a way,
I guess that's what I'm doing,</i>

01:39:47.983 --> 01:39:51.111
<i>sailing it from him to you.</i>

01:39:54.406 --> 01:39:56.241
<i>Live your life
that the fear of death</i>

01:39:56.408 --> 01:39:58.577
<i>Can never enter your heart</i>

01:39:58.744 --> 01:40:01.079
<i>Trouble no one about his religion</i>

01:40:01.246 --> 01:40:03.290
<i>Respect others and their views</i>

01:40:03.457 --> 01:40:06.084
<i>And demand they respect yours</i>

01:40:06.251 --> 01:40:09.338
<i>Love your life, perfect your life</i>

01:40:09.505 --> 01:40:12.257
<i>Beautify all things in your life</i>

01:40:12.424 --> 01:40:16.929
<i>Seek to make your life long
and of service to your people</i>

01:40:17.095 --> 01:40:19.014
<i>When your time comes to die</i>

01:40:19.181 --> 01:40:22.601
<i>Be not like those whose hearts
are filled with fear of death</i>

01:40:22.768 --> 01:40:24.937
<i>So that when their time comes
they weep and pray</i>

01:40:25.103 --> 01:40:28.941
<i>For a little more time to live their lives
over again in a different way</i>

01:40:29.107 --> 01:40:31.026
<i>Sing your death song</i>

01:40:31.193 --> 01:40:34.196
<i>And die like a hero going home</i>

01:40:35.305 --> 01:40:41.314
