'The following programme
contains strong language

00:03.400 --> 00:06.760
and scenes which some viewers
may find distressing.'

00:15.000 --> 00:18.320
We have been presented with a gift
in this town.

00:18.360 --> 00:21.360
It felt like...I was visited.

00:21.400 --> 00:23.760
I don't trust them.

00:23.800 --> 00:26.160
Joe, look at me!

00:26.200 --> 00:29.320
The children are controlling you.

00:29.360 --> 00:31.480
You don't love us.

00:31.520 --> 00:33.280
You think we're bad.

00:33.320 --> 00:36.800
No. We can live together.
You can live here.

00:36.840 --> 00:38.880
And if anything goes wrong?

00:38.920 --> 00:40.920
Then I will bear the blame.

00:40.960 --> 00:43.560
I'm going to have a little sister.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.480
# Oranges and lemons

00:57.520 --> 00:59.880
# Say the bells of St Clements

00:59.920 --> 01:02.840
# You owe me five farthings

01:02.880 --> 01:05.760
# Say the bells of St Martin's

01:05.800 --> 01:08.040
# When will you pay me?

01:08.080 --> 01:11.240
# Say the bells of Old Bailey

01:11.280 --> 01:13.320
# When I grow rich

01:13.360 --> 01:15.920
# Say the bells of Shoreditch

01:15.960 --> 01:18.240
# When will that be?

01:18.280 --> 01:20.440
# Say the bells of Stepney

01:20.480 --> 01:22.880
# I do not know

01:22.920 --> 01:25.760
# Say the great bells of Bow

01:25.800 --> 01:28.040
# Here comes a candle

01:28.080 --> 01:30.480
# To light you to bed

01:30.520 --> 01:33.240
# And here comes a chopper

01:33.280 --> 01:35.600
# To chop off your head

01:35.640 --> 01:38.560
# Chip, chop

01:38.600 --> 01:40.920
# Chip, chop

01:40.960 --> 01:42.840
# Chip, chop

01:42.880 --> 01:45.560
# Chip, chop

01:45.600 --> 01:47.800
# Chip, chop

01:47.840 --> 01:50.920
# Chip, chop

01:50.960 --> 01:52.480
# Chip

01:53.440 --> 01:55.000
# Chop

01:56.440 --> 01:58.160
# Chip... #

02:26.680 --> 02:28.280
Morning, Evie.
Morning.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.360
OK.

02:31.400 --> 02:35.600
Right, here's your breakfast, love.

02:40.160 --> 02:42.760
Erm, do you want to take some
biscuits with you?

02:42.800 --> 02:44.800
Chocolate, please.

02:44.840 --> 02:47.880
Er, I think we might actually
only have ginger.

02:51.320 --> 02:53.080
Ginger's fine.

02:55.480 --> 02:57.200
There you go, my angel.

03:07.160 --> 03:09.400
Morning, Carol.
Morning, Doctor Zellaby.

03:09.440 --> 03:12.280
How long have we been doing this?
It's Susannah, please.

03:12.320 --> 03:15.400
Sorry...Susannah. They're waiting
for you. With Mr Westcott.

03:15.440 --> 03:17.560
I didn't know
Mr Westcott was here.

03:17.600 --> 03:24.600
Yes, he came on the first train.

03:24.640 --> 03:26.520
Firstly,
I wanted to congratulate you

03:26.560 --> 03:28.640
on the speed of the children's
development.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.200
Yes, they're doing well.
They're doing better than that.

03:31.240 --> 03:34.520
They're out-growing older brothers
and sisters. They're five,

03:34.560 --> 03:37.840
but they look and behave
like highly gifted ten-year-olds.

03:37.880 --> 03:42.000
Their mind is a akin to a remarkable
piece of machine learning.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.920
Yes, but they're not a machine,
are they, Mr Westcott?

03:44.960 --> 03:48.200
They're living beings.
Just like you and I.

03:48.240 --> 03:52.240
Well, I'm wondering if it's time
to understand them better.

03:57.840 --> 03:59.880
What's that? I'd like to take
a couple of the children,

03:59.920 --> 04:02.320
for some more advanced testing

04:02.360 --> 04:05.640
at one of our research centres.
It should only take a day.

04:08.840 --> 04:12.720
At a military base?
Outside of the town.

04:12.760 --> 04:15.080
A couple of hours' drive away.
It's a pilot project.

04:15.120 --> 04:16.880
If it goes well, we might do more.

04:16.920 --> 04:19.080
They... They won't let you do that.

04:19.120 --> 04:22.680
We think they may.
With respect, Mr Westcott,

04:22.720 --> 04:26.600
you haven't been here. The children
have never left Midwich.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.360
They feel safe here.

04:28.400 --> 04:30.560
They won't leave.
As I understand it,

04:30.600 --> 04:33.360
the children have been asking
what lies beyond.

04:34.240 --> 04:36.600
Asking who?

04:36.640 --> 04:38.440
They came to us at Ward 300.

04:42.600 --> 04:44.560
Why didn't they talk to me?

04:44.600 --> 04:47.760
Perhaps...
they didn't want to upset you.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.960
'You are a man,
I am a machine.

05:00.000 --> 05:03.920
Other than that slight difference,
we have a great deal in common.'

05:05.560 --> 05:07.480
What is it, big brother?

05:08.960 --> 05:12.240
I don't want to stay at Dad's
this weekend.

05:14.200 --> 05:16.000
I don't want you to either.

05:16.040 --> 05:18.320
But your dad needs to see you.

05:18.360 --> 05:20.880
I wish he wasn't my dad.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.600
I wish I was like you.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.560
Come on.

05:36.560 --> 05:39.440
We should look at this.

05:42.920 --> 05:45.960
Oh, no.
Oh, no, the airport closed.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.360
Oh, no.
Can we open the door?

05:49.400 --> 05:52.280
Just really, really one little bite.
One little bite.

05:53.360 --> 05:55.680
Yay, good girl.
Very good.

05:55.720 --> 05:58.160
Are you ready, Dad? We're late.

05:59.280 --> 06:03.760
Sure. Yeah, ready...and willing.

06:03.800 --> 06:06.160
Have a good day love.

06:07.160 --> 06:10.720
Goodbye, Ellie.
Bye.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.800
David,
get in the bloody van!

06:13.840 --> 06:15.520
I don't want to go!

06:16.880 --> 06:19.360
David, I will not tell you again!

06:19.400 --> 06:21.600
I want to stay with Mum.
Just a second, babe.

06:21.640 --> 06:23.880
David, get in the bloody van!

06:23.920 --> 06:26.040
I don't want to go!

06:26.080 --> 06:28.400
RACHEL:
It's only until Tuesday, David.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.760
David, get in the van!

06:35.120 --> 06:37.720
Bye, David.
You...

06:37.760 --> 06:39.800
you shut up, you!
Don't touch him!

06:42.480 --> 06:44.400
Get in!

06:46.440 --> 06:48.320
Ignore him, Hannah.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.480
Remember what Susannah said.

06:55.520 --> 06:58.800
Curtis doesn't represent any of us.

07:05.680 --> 07:07.520
Feel free to experiment a bit.

07:07.560 --> 07:10.480
We don't have to be too faithful
to what you see.

07:15.080 --> 07:18.920
Go on, Nathan. Express yourself. Hm?

07:21.040 --> 07:22.760
What's wrong?

07:24.360 --> 07:28.600
I have to do some tests
at Ward 300 on Monday.

07:31.280 --> 07:33.640
Erm...who says?

07:33.680 --> 07:37.160
Uncle Paul.
He'll pick me up from home.

07:38.400 --> 07:40.920
Well, that's OK, isn't it?

07:44.600 --> 07:47.600
OK. That's really good.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.800
You're sure you're OK about this?

07:59.840 --> 08:02.280
We trust you.
But...

08:02.320 --> 08:05.920
this wasn't my idea.
If you'd come to me,

08:05.960 --> 08:08.040
I could've planned it.

08:08.080 --> 08:10.200
We could've talked about it
at our weekly meeting.

08:10.240 --> 08:12.200
Don't be angry, Granny.

08:12.240 --> 08:15.160
I'm glad you're coming.
I'm not angry.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.840
I just... Well, I wouldn't be here
if I hadn't insisted.

09:16.080 --> 09:18.680
OK, team, computers off, please.

09:36.640 --> 09:38.160
David?

09:38.200 --> 09:40.240
David?

09:41.640 --> 09:44.640
David?

09:45.800 --> 09:47.560
David?

09:55.280 --> 09:57.680
Ah, so this is where you are.
TOY: 'You are a man, I am a- '

09:57.720 --> 10:00.520
Come on,
we are already late for school.

10:00.560 --> 10:03.880
Turn it off mate, let's go. Why
don't you live at home any more?

10:03.920 --> 10:06.160
With Mum and Joe?

10:09.800 --> 10:11.800
You know why.

10:16.320 --> 10:18.600
So, the Incas should not have
trusted the Spanish?

10:18.640 --> 10:21.240
Well, there's a school
of thought that says

10:21.280 --> 10:24.600
history is the victory
of the ruthless over the naive.

10:24.640 --> 10:26.840
And certainly the Spanish
consciously chose

10:26.880 --> 10:29.320
not to co-exist
with the indigenous populations.

10:29.360 --> 10:32.120
But you are choosing
to co-exist with us.

10:32.160 --> 10:35.400
Yes, Connor. Because history changes
and humans learn.

10:35.440 --> 10:37.720
We learnt about you.
You learnt about us.

10:37.760 --> 10:40.040
And now we live happily together.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.560
Case in point...

11:01.360 --> 11:03.960
Present...arms!

11:04.000 --> 11:06.160
One, two, three!

11:10.880 --> 11:12.960
Present arms!

11:13.000 --> 11:16.160
One, two, three!

11:17.320 --> 11:19.200
Welcome to Winthorpe.

11:20.320 --> 11:22.480
One, two, three, hah!

11:22.520 --> 11:24.200
What is this place?

11:24.240 --> 11:26.280
200 soldiers are based here.

11:27.200 --> 11:30.080
It's kept out of the public eye
as much as possible,

11:30.120 --> 11:32.120
so it's perfect for our purposes.

11:32.160 --> 11:34.880
The research station is there.

11:34.920 --> 11:38.520
If it's all right with you children,
we will go there now.

11:38.560 --> 11:40.760
Nothing scary,
a couple of brain scans,

11:40.800 --> 11:42.680
some IQ tests, that sort of thing.

11:43.720 --> 11:45.400
Of course.

11:49.600 --> 11:51.840
I'm afraid
it's a limited-access area.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.160
But we will be back soon.

11:54.200 --> 11:57.240
One, two, three, hah!

12:31.880 --> 12:35.080
One. Two. Three. Four!

12:37.720 --> 12:39.800
What are they doing in there?

12:39.840 --> 12:42.080
What tests?

12:42.120 --> 12:44.480
Why aren't we allowed in?
I have no idea.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.640
They told you nothing about this?

12:49.680 --> 12:51.800
I heard half an hour before you did.

12:55.880 --> 12:57.640
So much for no more secrets.

12:59.760 --> 13:02.200
What does he want with them, Paul?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.560
Quick march!

16:21.840 --> 16:24.080
Left, right, left, right,
left, right!

16:24.120 --> 16:29.480
Left, right! Left!
Left, right, left, right left right!

16:29.520 --> 16:31.400
Are you OK?

16:32.920 --> 16:34.760
Yeah.

16:35.840 --> 16:40.640
Left! One! Two! Three! Four!
Left, right!

16:40.680 --> 16:43.120
Left, right, left, right! Left!

16:45.960 --> 16:48.320
Left!

16:49.960 --> 16:51.960
David, I'm back.

17:00.080 --> 17:02.000
David?

17:08.960 --> 17:10.800
David?

17:10.840 --> 17:12.560
You here?

17:23.120 --> 17:24.840
David?

17:27.160 --> 17:29.120
David, mate?

17:31.560 --> 17:33.680
David, come out now.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.000
David!

17:40.720 --> 17:42.560
David, I am not angry at you.

17:45.000 --> 17:47.560
David! David! Come out now!

17:49.840 --> 17:51.800
David!

17:58.840 --> 18:00.760
David?!

18:07.720 --> 18:10.560
David! David? David.

18:10.600 --> 18:12.280
What's...

18:12.320 --> 18:14.640
What's happened to you?

18:16.440 --> 18:19.280
David, look at me. Look at me.

18:23.560 --> 18:25.960
WHAT'S HAPPENED TO HIM?!

18:35.200 --> 18:37.000
Let me see my him.
What are you doing?

18:37.040 --> 18:38.720
Let me comfort my son.
Calm down, Curtis.

18:38.760 --> 18:41.560
DAVID! DAVID!
Curtis.

18:41.600 --> 18:44.560
You can't be here.... How did you
let this happen? What did you do?

18:45.800 --> 18:49.160
What the fuck!
Get him out of here.

18:49.200 --> 18:51.440
DAVID?! DAVID?!

18:52.720 --> 18:54.880
Get him to the station now.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.120
You OK?
Yeah.

18:58.160 --> 19:00.720
Can I talk to David?

19:11.240 --> 19:14.600
You remember Dr Zellaby, David?

19:16.400 --> 19:19.640
Has he eaten anything?
Nothing yet.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.680
Thank you.

19:28.480 --> 19:30.240
Hello, David.

19:31.120 --> 19:33.840
I just wanted to have
a quick chat with you

19:33.880 --> 19:35.920
about what happened with your Dad.

19:35.960 --> 19:37.920
You went to school.
Do you remember leaving?

19:37.960 --> 19:39.560
School.

19:40.560 --> 19:43.240
Did you go home to your Dad?

19:43.280 --> 19:45.920
School...

19:45.960 --> 19:48.360
Yes, that's right,
you...you went to school,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.560
and then you left...

19:55.160 --> 19:57.160
School.

19:57.200 --> 19:59.120
School.

20:00.440 --> 20:02.480
Oh, my baby.

20:03.640 --> 20:05.480
David?

20:05.520 --> 20:07.200
Please...

20:07.240 --> 20:08.960
Who are you?

20:09.000 --> 20:11.320
Oh, no.

20:26.640 --> 20:29.440
He remembers nothing of his parents,
nothing of his life.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.600
It's like he's no longer there.

20:34.480 --> 20:37.480
In some abuse cases,
memory's suppressed.

20:39.040 --> 20:41.080
It could be-
Curtis.

20:41.120 --> 20:43.040
Yeah.
Yeah, it's not.

20:48.800 --> 20:51.160
Something happened at Winthorpe.
We both know it.

20:52.280 --> 20:54.160
Yeah. But what?

20:56.400 --> 20:58.960
All I know
is that they're lying to us..

21:03.080 --> 21:05.040
Act like you know nothing.

21:06.520 --> 21:08.960
Make them believe
that you're their friend,

21:09.000 --> 21:10.960
and find out what they're planning.

21:15.120 --> 21:17.040
Don't say anything to Bryony.

21:18.280 --> 21:20.160
I don't trust her.

21:20.200 --> 21:22.640
I don't trust a single one of them.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.080
Hello?

21:45.120 --> 21:46.440
Hey!

21:46.480 --> 21:49.040
Come in. Sorry for the mess.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.880
This is er... This is nice.

21:56.840 --> 21:58.720
I'm trying.

22:02.280 --> 22:04.320
Listen, the reason I called...

22:04.360 --> 22:09.360
Yesterday,
Nathan and I weren't at Ward 300.

22:09.400 --> 22:12.280
We were at a military base
in the countryside.

22:12.320 --> 22:14.440
And we were...
we were told to keep it secret.

22:14.480 --> 22:18.000
But I just...
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

22:21.320 --> 22:25.000
Erm...why did you go there?

22:25.040 --> 22:27.800
They said it was just for tests.

22:27.840 --> 22:29.600
But I don't believe them.

22:29.640 --> 22:33.000
Now, a few days ago,
I thought we had this under control.

22:34.880 --> 22:37.000
Now I don't know anything

22:37.040 --> 22:39.880
I don't understand.
Why wouldn't Nathan tell me?

22:39.920 --> 22:42.640
Have you noticed
anything in his behaviour recently?

22:43.680 --> 22:45.040
Hey, mate.

22:54.000 --> 22:56.200
I don't want to leave you.

24:02.240 --> 24:04.240
I just found this at the school.

24:05.440 --> 24:07.720
I saw David there the other day.

24:07.760 --> 24:09.400
The day I passed out

24:09.440 --> 24:12.320
You told anyone?
Not yet.

24:13.640 --> 24:15.640
Right, then, don't.
Just throw it away.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.520
Get rid of it.
What? Please.

24:17.560 --> 24:19.360
We have Ellie now.

24:19.400 --> 24:21.280
That is all we have to think about.

24:49.200 --> 24:51.560
Why is she still here?
JOE: She won't leave him.

24:51.600 --> 24:53.280
She stayed all night.

24:54.600 --> 24:56.840
You made a mistake,
letting him live.

24:56.880 --> 24:58.560
He won't say anything.

24:59.680 --> 25:02.360
It's a risk. For the project.

25:02.400 --> 25:04.040
Trust us.

25:04.080 --> 25:07.520
They all think it's the father.
We know what we're doing.

25:23.840 --> 25:25.880
Come on, sweetheart.

25:29.880 --> 25:32.440
There we go, love.

25:32.480 --> 25:34.960
Want anything else?
Strawberry jam.

25:51.640 --> 25:53.480
Rachel?

25:53.520 --> 25:55.400
Susannah!

25:55.440 --> 25:57.360
I'm coming to you now.

25:57.400 --> 25:58.880
It's them.

25:58.920 --> 26:00.600
It's them.

26:03.320 --> 26:04.720
Rachel?
'There we go, sweetheart.'

26:04.760 --> 26:06.520
'Rachel, what's them?'

26:29.320 --> 26:31.120
Evie?

26:38.680 --> 26:41.640
Morning, love.
Where are you off to?

26:55.680 --> 26:57.800
It's OK, baby. It's OK.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.840
I'm so sorry. It's OK.

27:06.480 --> 27:08.840
I'm taking you somewhere safe.

28:48.280 --> 28:51.320
Thank you.
My name is Bernard Westcott

28:51.360 --> 28:53.720
and I represent
Her Majesty's government.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.440
As the governing authority...

28:57.480 --> 29:01.040
I would like to accept full
responsibility for

29:01.080 --> 29:05.360
what happened here...
yesterday morning.

29:05.400 --> 29:07.240
We let this happen on our watch.

29:07.280 --> 29:13.120
As a result, the children no
longer feel safe in Midwich.

29:13.160 --> 29:15.080
Sorry, the children don't feel safe?

29:15.120 --> 29:16.520
Stewart...
Please... Thank you.

29:16.560 --> 29:19.600
All they did was defend themselves.

29:19.640 --> 29:22.560
That's right.
You really believe that?

29:22.600 --> 29:25.800
If we can just- She drove right at
them. She tried to kill them!

29:25.840 --> 29:28.200
It's on camera.
Two years ago we were assured

29:28.240 --> 29:30.320
this kind of thing
would never happen again.

29:31.760 --> 29:35.720
Doctor Zellaby negotiated a truce.
It wasn't us that broke it.

29:37.240 --> 29:43.760
A truce is an arrangement between
enemies. Is that what we are?

29:48.360 --> 29:50.760
Now, Rachel was out of her mind.

29:50.800 --> 29:52.960
She hadn't slept...
That's right.

29:53.000 --> 29:55.000
Give it a break Cass.

29:57.080 --> 29:58.680
What do you mean?

29:58.720 --> 30:01.640
Rachel didn't deserve that.
Whatever she did.

30:01.680 --> 30:03.120
They're children. Nora.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.480
And they're ours.

30:05.520 --> 30:07.720
They're not children.

30:07.760 --> 30:11.000
At least, not in a way
that I can understand.

30:11.040 --> 30:13.680
What would you know about it,
Stewart?

30:13.720 --> 30:16.400
You never wanted yours
in the first place.

30:16.440 --> 30:18.640
Well, I don't want mine now.

30:18.680 --> 30:20.520
Jane...
No.

30:20.560 --> 30:22.840
It's too much.

30:22.880 --> 30:26.480
I've spent five years
colluding with their will...

30:26.520 --> 30:29.000
convincing myself
these are God's creatures.

30:31.400 --> 30:33.080
You're nothing of the kind.

30:33.120 --> 30:34.800
Are you?

30:40.600 --> 30:42.360
You enabled this.

30:43.400 --> 30:46.280
You told us we could trust them.

30:54.360 --> 30:58.080
If I may continue. Having consulted
with the children...

30:59.160 --> 31:04.800
..it seems prudent to arrange their
staggered departure from Midwich.

31:04.840 --> 31:07.080
Hold on a second.
What... What are you talking about?

31:07.120 --> 31:10.000
The children will cease attending
the school with immediate effect,

31:10.040 --> 31:13.520
and plans will be made to ensure
smooth transition

31:13.560 --> 31:15.960
from their current homes
to a governmental facility.

31:16.000 --> 31:17.640
Susannah, what is going on?

31:17.680 --> 31:20.000
The children don't want to leave.

31:20.040 --> 31:22.240
And, and they're not going to,
alright? Tell them.

31:22.280 --> 31:25.400
Evie, tell them.
Tell them that you want to stay.

31:25.440 --> 31:27.480
Evie!

31:45.000 --> 31:46.800
Cassie.

31:47.760 --> 31:49.280
Cassie.

31:53.440 --> 31:55.400
Cassie.

31:58.400 --> 32:00.160
Cassie.

32:00.200 --> 32:03.680
Cassie, they lied to me too.
They've deceived all of us.

32:03.720 --> 32:05.720
Did you take them to that place,
on that day?

32:08.360 --> 32:10.120
Yeah.

32:27.200 --> 32:30.520
This looks slow.
Mm.

32:31.520 --> 32:35.560
The Judge threw out our application
for Curtis Saunders' detention.

32:38.320 --> 32:40.200
Alright, let him go.

32:40.240 --> 32:43.880
But David stays in Ward 300.
Under our care. No visitors.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.000
Not until the children leave.

33:09.480 --> 33:10.920
Mum's upset.

33:13.440 --> 33:15.600
We all are.

33:15.640 --> 33:17.440
Can you talk to her?

33:18.520 --> 33:21.840
I don't think she's interested
in talking to me at the moment.

33:23.080 --> 33:25.240
We're sorry about Rachel.

33:28.120 --> 33:31.200
We had no choice.
She tried to kill us.

33:32.920 --> 33:36.200
And why would she try to do that?

33:36.240 --> 33:38.040
I don't know.

33:39.320 --> 33:41.640
But now we have to leave.

33:44.040 --> 33:47.840
I thought I knew you, Evie.
I really did.

33:47.880 --> 33:50.040
There is no me, Granny.

33:50.080 --> 33:52.840
No?
No.

33:52.880 --> 33:54.600
Sometimes I'm Evie

33:54.640 --> 33:57.360
and sometimes I'm Connor or Sunny.

33:57.400 --> 33:59.720
I don't believe that.

33:59.760 --> 34:03.280
Take that ice cream, for example.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.440
You always have that flavour.
Only you.

34:06.480 --> 34:08.600
Because you like it.

34:09.680 --> 34:11.920
Very much.

34:11.960 --> 34:15.720
So why can't we be special to you
like that? Me and Mummy?

34:16.760 --> 34:18.680
You're not an ice cream Granny.
No.

34:18.720 --> 34:22.360
We are your flesh and blood.
We should be a thousand times

34:22.400 --> 34:24.480
more important than that.

34:26.080 --> 34:30.280
Evie, I really hoped that by,
by living here with us,

34:30.320 --> 34:33.400
you would start to enjoy
the differences between you.

34:35.160 --> 34:38.120
Difference causes problems.

34:38.160 --> 34:40.760
No.

34:40.800 --> 34:43.080
Difference gives us meaning.

34:44.200 --> 34:46.400
We don't agree with that.

34:49.760 --> 34:52.240
Your mother is gonna miss you.
so much

34:53.280 --> 34:54.920
She won't.

34:58.840 --> 35:01.040
None of you will.

35:29.440 --> 35:30.680
Daddy?

35:39.720 --> 35:41.600
What were you talking
to Mummy about?

35:41.640 --> 35:44.880
Yesterday morning.
Before I went out.

35:47.000 --> 35:48.800
Nothing, Hannah.

35:48.840 --> 35:50.880
Just about Ellie's new nursery.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.160
Listen, Curtis...

36:12.640 --> 36:15.600
the government have a care order
still active against you.

36:15.640 --> 36:17.920
Now, it stops you from seeing David.

36:19.960 --> 36:23.120
Now, if you, if wanna live
with your son again,

36:23.160 --> 36:25.280
you...you really must do what I say.

36:26.280 --> 36:27.400
OK?

36:27.440 --> 36:29.840
I'm serious.

36:30.920 --> 36:34.680
There are things going on here
that neither you nor I understand.

37:08.360 --> 37:10.480
Yeah, sure. I'll er...

37:10.520 --> 37:12.960
Of course, I'll meet you there.

37:14.480 --> 37:16.160
Erm...

37:18.600 --> 37:20.400
Listen, I have to go to a meeting.

37:20.440 --> 37:22.960
Up at the hospital.
What now?

37:23.000 --> 37:26.680
It's an emergency.
About the departure.

37:27.760 --> 37:29.440
Listen.

37:29.480 --> 37:33.120
Cassie, there are things I have
to tell you, things about Evie.

37:33.160 --> 37:35.640
About Rachel.
What? Tell me, then.

37:35.680 --> 37:38.360
I will tell you everything
when I get home. I promise.

37:38.400 --> 37:41.400
Ten o'clock.
Ten o'clock, I'll be back.

38:03.440 --> 38:06.000
He made me promise only to tell you.
He doesn't want Zoe to know

38:06.040 --> 38:07.920
he said anything.

38:07.960 --> 38:10.920
Where did he find it?
Round by the cellars.

38:10.960 --> 38:14.080
The outside cellar door is locked,
but I have the front keys.

38:37.520 --> 38:41.760
David. David kept saying,
"School. School."

38:41.800 --> 38:44.480
And I thought he meant his own.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.280
Something did happen here.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.440
Wait here.

39:19.720 --> 39:22.400
What are you two doing here?

39:23.480 --> 39:25.200
Why are you here, Mr Haynes?

39:29.920 --> 39:32.200
The cleaner found this
in the cellar.

39:32.240 --> 39:33.880
It belongs to David Saunders.

39:33.920 --> 39:36.120
You know anything about this?

39:37.800 --> 39:41.320
Are you sure?
We're sure.

39:43.520 --> 39:46.160
You should probably give
us those keys, now Mr Haynes.

39:46.200 --> 39:48.240
Don't tell me what to do.

40:05.360 --> 40:07.080
Are you alone?

40:07.120 --> 40:10.360
No, I've got a full SWAT team
with me. What do you think?

40:11.520 --> 40:13.440
You're funny.

40:36.400 --> 40:38.080
We like you, Mr Haynes.

40:38.120 --> 40:40.160
We don't want to hurt you.

40:40.200 --> 40:42.640
But you come with us now.

40:43.760 --> 40:45.080
Evie?

40:45.120 --> 40:47.120
What's wrong?

40:50.280 --> 40:52.440
We're going out. Tell no-one.

40:54.560 --> 40:57.800
No. No. No. No.
I need to talk to you.

40:57.840 --> 41:00.000
Not now.

41:09.000 --> 41:10.240
Evie.

41:11.360 --> 41:13.240
Evie, come back!

41:14.320 --> 41:16.480
Evie, come back now!

41:16.520 --> 41:19.600
Evie!

41:50.720 --> 41:52.720
Nathan will stay with you tonight.

41:53.760 --> 41:56.600
Don't tell anyone about this.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.720
Don't leave the house again.

42:00.760 --> 42:04.520
What are you gonna do...
when you leave Midwich?

42:04.560 --> 42:07.840
This will be over soon, Mr Haynes.

42:07.880 --> 42:10.080
Just stay out of it.

42:19.960 --> 42:21.760
Where are you going?

42:21.800 --> 42:24.680
You've just missed our turn.
Back to the school.

42:24.720 --> 42:26.520
You can't go to the school.

42:27.600 --> 42:29.600
They'll know I'm helping you.

42:29.640 --> 42:32.040
What are you doing?

42:33.640 --> 42:35.360
What are you doing?

42:36.640 --> 42:38.280
Why would you do that?

42:40.800 --> 42:42.720
So they can't listen.

42:42.760 --> 42:44.840
The pain blocks them.

43:10.560 --> 43:13.040
'This is Susannah. I can't take
your call now right now.'

43:13.080 --> 43:15.280
Fuck. 'Please leave a message.'

43:15.320 --> 43:17.480
Yeah, hi. Erm...it's me.

43:18.480 --> 43:20.200
Er...

43:20.240 --> 43:22.720
Evie's gone and I don't...
Yeah, I don't know what to do..

43:22.760 --> 43:25.120
So can you just give me a call
back, when you get this.

43:29.200 --> 43:31.400
'My name's Cassie Stone.'

43:31.440 --> 43:33.680
I'm just calling about my mother.

43:33.720 --> 43:36.160
She was meant to have a late
meeting there tonight,

43:36.200 --> 43:38.080
and I was just checking in.

43:38.120 --> 43:40.080
WOMAN:
'There was no meeting here tonight.'

44:23.480 --> 44:26.920
'Hey, stranger. Shop's open.
What can I get you?'

45:38.920 --> 45:41.040
