'In the criminal justice system,

00:03.037 --> 00:06.457
'sexually based offences
are considered especially heinous.

00:06.498 --> 00:10.627
'In New York City, the detectives
who investigate these vicious felonies

00:10.669 --> 00:14.298
'are members of an elite squad
known as the Special Victims Unit.

00:14.340 --> 00:16.925
These are their stories.'

00:18.000 --> 00:24.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

00:33.792 --> 00:37.629
A guy dropped these off
about 45 minutes ago.

00:37.670 --> 00:41.424
The photomat just closed.
I've never seen him before.

00:41.466 --> 00:46.554
- What's his name?
- Er, Larry Holt. He had a coupon.

00:46.596 --> 00:51.768
A rep came in and gave a talk.
He told me to call about weird things.

00:51.809 --> 00:53.645
This kid is posed.

00:53.686 --> 00:56.856
- See the way he looks at the camera?
- That's it.

00:56.898 --> 01:02.779
An open bottle of alcohol.
Endangering the welfare of a child.

01:02.820 --> 01:06.240
- You don't think we can arrest him?
- EWC is all we got.

01:06.282 --> 01:08.785
It's hard to prove it's child porn.

01:08.826 --> 01:11.245
I think it's the tip of the iceberg.

01:11.287 --> 01:14.582
He gets a whiff of us,
he'll clean out everything.

01:14.624 --> 01:18.920
Let's follow him for a few weeks
and don't waft his way.

01:23.007 --> 01:25.593
What's going on here?

01:27.428 --> 01:29.472
So much for not wafting his way.

01:29.513 --> 01:31.557
- Are these yours?
- Yes.

02:27.446 --> 02:31.033
Where there is one photo
there is a hundred more.

02:31.074 --> 02:35.704
- You don't even have EWC.
- That bottle is over 80 proof.

02:35.746 --> 02:41.001
You can't prove that's not apple juice.
He could have found a stash.

02:41.043 --> 02:43.420
- Which is EWC.
- You jumped the gun.

02:43.462 --> 02:47.049
- No.
- Holt knew that we were detectives.

02:47.090 --> 02:51.845
If there are other photos,
he'd have gone home and destroyed them.

02:51.887 --> 02:56.058
There's nothing in these
that we can do anything about.

02:58.185 --> 03:01.480
Look at this. The kid is wearing hot pants.

03:01.521 --> 03:04.065
- Shorts.
- They ride up high.

03:04.107 --> 03:07.944
- He had a growth spurt.
- His smile is not normal.

03:07.986 --> 03:13.033
- Unless you're in a beauty pageant.
- How many boys go in for them?

03:13.074 --> 03:15.619
All right. Keep goin'.

03:15.702 --> 03:20.248
The pose. The look.
These are taught, and not by other kids.

03:20.290 --> 03:25.837
Any guy who takes these
is gonna keep these. He'll collect them.

03:25.879 --> 03:29.883
- How's the kid related?
- Holt teaches piano to this kid.

03:29.924 --> 03:31.968
These are sexual.

03:32.010 --> 03:37.682
Paedophiles keep evidence of
their sexual acts. I know there are more.

03:37.724 --> 03:43.313
- You want a warrant based on your ESP?
- Yeah, I do.

03:43.354 --> 03:45.690
This is post-McMartin.

03:45.732 --> 03:49.402
Any judge worth her salt
will throw out the arrest.

03:49.444 --> 03:51.696
Captain Cragen.

03:51.738 --> 03:56.951
My client informs me that you took
his watch, his wallet, his keys.

03:56.993 --> 04:02.248
We voucher all property at the time
of arrest to prevent theft or loss.

04:02.290 --> 04:03.624
I need those keys.

04:03.666 --> 04:06.127
- Why?
- For his house.

04:06.169 --> 04:07.336
Tell me why.

04:07.378 --> 04:09.881
I need to feed the dog.

04:09.922 --> 04:12.759
- The dog will be fine.
- Where are the keys?

04:12.842 --> 04:15.136
Property clerk.

04:19.390 --> 04:22.310
You did make a run to the property clerk?

04:22.351 --> 04:26.522
- In about two hours.
- There's something in his apartment.

04:26.564 --> 04:28.608
I'll put a uniform on the door.

04:28.649 --> 04:31.402
- You need probable cause.
- And this kid?

04:31.485 --> 04:34.071
- Small neighbourhood.
- Let's go.

04:34.113 --> 04:38.200
- The building's sealed.
- You can't tell me I can't go in.

04:38.242 --> 04:41.662
- I was told to not let anyone in.
- You can't stop me.

04:41.746 --> 04:43.581
Is there a problem here?

04:43.664 --> 04:45.708
Yes. Hi.

04:45.750 --> 04:49.170
- I'm being barred from my house.
- You live here?

04:49.211 --> 04:51.213
My father does.

04:51.255 --> 04:53.966
These premises are secured.

04:54.008 --> 04:58.345
- Do you have a warrant?
- It's before a judge. She will rule.

04:58.387 --> 05:01.515
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

05:03.350 --> 05:05.144
Has he got a money tree here?

05:05.185 --> 05:08.897
- We don't know.
- This whole place belongs to Holt?

05:08.939 --> 05:10.357
Nice place.

05:10.399 --> 05:13.277
Where does a piano teacher
get that money?

05:13.319 --> 05:15.988
A rich white guy moving here is no accident.

05:16.030 --> 05:20.367
Think it's an accident
that he lives near an elementary school?

05:21.160 --> 05:23.245
- Excuse me!
- Whoa!

05:23.287 --> 05:25.038
Where are you goin'?

05:25.080 --> 05:27.332
I have piano lessons.

05:30.627 --> 05:34.423
So, Jonathan, is Mr Holt a good teacher?

05:34.464 --> 05:36.550
Yeah. He's good.

05:36.592 --> 05:39.928
Did he ever touch you
when you played piano?

05:39.970 --> 05:43.557
He keeps his hand on my back for posture.

05:43.599 --> 05:46.435
Did it make you feel uncomfortable?

05:46.476 --> 05:49.021
My dad says it's OK.

05:49.062 --> 05:51.857
He's like that with all his students.

05:51.898 --> 05:54.526
- You go to his lessons?
- I work late.

05:54.568 --> 05:58.905
- So, who are his students?
- Kids in the neighbourhood.

05:58.947 --> 06:01.867
- Boys and girls?
- Girls? Please!

06:01.908 --> 06:03.952
OK.

06:03.994 --> 06:08.373
Jonathan, did Mr Holt take pictures
of you while you played?

06:08.415 --> 06:13.795
Yes. But he has a whole lot of other
pictures. He calls them snappies.

06:13.837 --> 06:17.799
Snappies?
Did he ever show you these snappies?

06:17.841 --> 06:20.010
No. I found 'em.

06:21.761 --> 06:23.179
Where?

06:23.263 --> 06:27.976
I turned a page on the music stand
and a bunch of snappies fell out.

06:28.018 --> 06:30.353
Are they like your snappies?

06:30.395 --> 06:35.066
Those boys in the snappies
didn't have any clothes on.

06:39.279 --> 06:43.908
- That's probable cause.
- We won't get a night-time exemption.

06:43.950 --> 06:48.079
If we don't get in by nine,
we won't get in until 6am tomorrow.

06:48.121 --> 06:52.500
- They're pushing for arraignment.
- We lose the uniform in two hours.

06:52.542 --> 06:55.044
If we don't get in, someone else will.

06:55.086 --> 06:59.215
- You two go file the warrant.
- I'll page Judge Rothman.

06:59.257 --> 07:02.176
We'll go in while the ink is drying.

07:07.432 --> 07:12.520
Photos, negatives, slides, cameras,
books, magazines, Xeroxes

07:12.562 --> 07:16.607
and printed material
at the residence of Lawrence Holt.

07:16.649 --> 07:20.403
- 30 East 112th Street.
- Let's add video tape and film.

07:21.946 --> 07:27.118
Adding video cassettes,
video tape and film. Anything else?

07:27.160 --> 07:29.245
It's three till nine.

07:31.581 --> 07:33.457
You got your warrant.

07:33.499 --> 07:36.836
You got it. Great. We got it. Open it up.

07:45.428 --> 07:49.348
- It's pretty quiet in here.
- Maybe the dog died.

07:49.390 --> 07:53.310
What is this place?
The lesson room.

08:09.618 --> 08:11.704
OK.

08:35.894 --> 08:38.856
'Please don't.'
'It's OK.'

08:38.897 --> 08:41.357
'No, that hurts.'

09:00.252 --> 09:04.172
And 43 photos in the album were obscene?

09:04.214 --> 09:06.717
- Yes, Your Honour.
- May I?

09:06.758 --> 09:08.593
Briefly.

09:08.635 --> 09:14.432
The court is under pressure to punish
child abusers to the full extent of the law.

09:14.474 --> 09:16.726
Somehow it never seems enough.

09:16.768 --> 09:19.354
Based on the evidence found,

09:19.396 --> 09:24.067
the defendant is charged with
endangering the welfare of a child,

09:24.109 --> 09:26.903
use of a child in a sexual performance,

09:26.945 --> 09:30.949
promoting an obscene
sexual performance by a child...

09:30.991 --> 09:36.162
- How many tapes did you find?
- Last count was 157.

09:37.372 --> 09:39.916
Impressive, Mr Holt.

09:40.917 --> 09:43.628
44 counts of possessing

09:43.670 --> 09:48.216
- a sexual performance by a child...
- The people have clearly not had

09:48.258 --> 09:53.555
the opportunity or the time
to inventory each cassette.

09:53.596 --> 09:56.558
We all dread the discovery process.

09:56.599 --> 10:00.061
Bail is denied. The defendant is remanded.

10:02.188 --> 10:05.441
- 'Are you ready to start?'
- 'Play it with me.'

10:05.483 --> 10:08.653
Is this the tape you found in the VCR?

10:08.695 --> 10:12.490
- Yeah.
- This goes back 13 years.

10:14.450 --> 10:16.536
'OK.'

10:26.421 --> 10:28.798
- 'Please don't.'
- 'It's OK.'

10:28.840 --> 10:31.634
'No, that hurts.'

10:47.733 --> 10:53.406
'You scamp! I didn't know you
were gonna do that! Good for you.'

10:53.447 --> 10:57.118
What is this? Holt's greatest hits?

10:57.159 --> 10:59.662
How many kids are there?

11:06.502 --> 11:08.963
'Please don't.'

11:09.004 --> 11:14.552
'You have so much talent.
But you need to learn restraint.

11:14.593 --> 11:17.429
'Technique is discipline.'

11:21.850 --> 11:24.311
'Not now. Not again.'

11:24.353 --> 11:28.524
- That's not a different kid.
- It's the same person.

11:28.565 --> 11:30.109
Grown-up.

11:43.038 --> 11:45.457
'That was very good.

11:45.499 --> 11:48.293
'I felt your passion.'

11:48.335 --> 11:50.671
'Thank you.'

11:59.638 --> 12:02.140
Did you see the tape?

12:02.182 --> 12:04.434
We usually hear about it after.

12:04.476 --> 12:06.770
To actually see it...

12:06.812 --> 12:10.857
There's a lot more to go through.

12:12.401 --> 12:14.861
There could be 50,

12:14.903 --> 12:17.405
maybe 100 more kids.

12:22.410 --> 12:24.412
I'll do it.

12:24.454 --> 12:28.333
You got Holt arraigned
on possession and promoting.

12:28.375 --> 12:31.795
We gotta get back in there.
We need his computer,

12:31.836 --> 12:36.049
- his day planner, his schedule.
- Wait. What about abuse?

12:36.091 --> 12:38.885
No. To do that you need a kid.

12:38.927 --> 12:41.137
We need that kid.

12:49.979 --> 12:52.273
OK, let's go.

12:55.318 --> 12:58.905
He looks familiar but I don't know his name.

12:58.947 --> 13:02.033
Does your son
take piano lessons from Mr Holt?

13:02.075 --> 13:06.496
Not yet. My son doesn't like music.
But I talked to Larry

13:06.538 --> 13:10.708
and he says it's never too late
to develop an ear.

13:14.295 --> 13:16.673
Yeah, sure. He plays piano.

13:16.714 --> 13:19.509
- You should ask...
- The piano teacher.

13:19.550 --> 13:23.262
He lives across the way.
He knows all the kids.

13:23.304 --> 13:26.474
- What do you know about him?
- He's a teacher.

13:26.516 --> 13:30.103
- A little fruity, but, you know.
- Fruity?

13:30.144 --> 13:33.856
Yeah. Always touches everything, everyone.

13:33.898 --> 13:36.192
- But, you know.
- No, I don't know.

13:36.234 --> 13:40.321
- None of my business.
- Was there somethin' goin' on?

13:40.363 --> 13:44.784
Why do you care?
You're only here after somethin' happens.

13:44.825 --> 13:47.703
Well, I'm here now.

13:47.745 --> 13:51.040
Then that's your business.

13:51.290 --> 13:54.001
Did Holt rent children's videos?

13:54.043 --> 13:58.964
He's one of the most decent guys I know.
He gave my kids free lessons.

13:59.006 --> 14:01.342
Really? What did they say about him?

14:01.384 --> 14:06.972
The guy was strict, but they like him.
Anything goin' on, they'd tell me.

14:07.014 --> 14:09.058
You don't know Larry Holt.

14:09.100 --> 14:12.478
He takes kids in. He sees what they have.

14:12.520 --> 14:15.189
That they can do anything.

14:15.231 --> 14:17.900
- Do you see that kid?
- Mm-hm.

14:17.942 --> 14:21.320
His name is Rey Guzimano. Heard of him?

14:21.362 --> 14:24.031
- No.
- Man, can he play.

14:24.073 --> 14:26.408
Is Holt one of his teachers too?

14:26.450 --> 14:30.829
You know, Holt makes a difference
in people's lives.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.998
A hell of a lot more than you will.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.960
- People knew.
- Maybe they were optimistic.

14:37.002 --> 14:39.046
It's not the same as covering up.

14:39.088 --> 14:43.550
- They're trying to keep things together.
- Put food on the table.

14:43.592 --> 14:46.804
If they face the truth,
what kind of parents are they?

14:46.845 --> 14:49.056
- Did you talk to her?
- No.

14:49.097 --> 14:53.352
- I bet I know what you're thinkin'.
- I bet you don't.

14:53.393 --> 14:58.565
- Even the best parents can't help.
- The gutter at home needs fixing.

14:58.607 --> 15:01.568
Well, you can't do everything.

15:01.610 --> 15:05.197
You'd feel everything for 'em if you could.

15:05.238 --> 15:07.282
All the pain.

15:07.324 --> 15:14.581
You know, sometimes I just look
at kids and think, 'Why? Why do it at all?'

15:14.623 --> 15:18.043
Because you want to more than anything.

15:18.085 --> 15:21.379
Because you wanna love them every day.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.801
Where is that?

15:31.681 --> 15:33.391
Hello.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.268
Excuse me.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.062
Hey!

15:49.574 --> 15:52.160
How'd you get in here?

15:52.202 --> 15:55.246
I have a set of keys. Who are you?

15:55.288 --> 15:59.709
I'm Detective Benson.
This is Detective Stabler. Who are you?

15:59.751 --> 16:01.753
- Evan.
- The way you play...

16:01.795 --> 16:04.756
- Beautiful.
- Nice, yeah.

16:04.798 --> 16:08.009
Thanks. Erm, can I help you?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.929
Yeah. We're looking for this person.

16:16.893 --> 16:20.688
- It's a three-year programme.
- When's your audition?

16:20.730 --> 16:22.774
- Three days.
- You nervous?

16:22.815 --> 16:27.028
Yeah, it's Juilliard.
If I get in, it'll be thanks to Mr Holt.

16:27.070 --> 16:28.279
What do you mean?

16:28.321 --> 16:31.491
- Mr Holt's a great teacher.
- Why?

16:31.532 --> 16:33.785
- He pushes you.
- How?

16:33.826 --> 16:39.123
He makes you practise a lot so that
you can develop a strong technique.

16:39.165 --> 16:41.209
How else did he push you?

16:41.250 --> 16:43.711
He just makes you practise.

16:43.753 --> 16:48.090
- How long have you played piano?
- Erm, forever, I guess.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.718
Mr Holt taught me for free.

16:54.722 --> 16:59.477
I need to ask you about your teacher.
About what he did to you.

16:59.518 --> 17:03.356
What do you mean?
He hasn't done anything to me.

17:03.397 --> 17:08.861
Evan, everything you're feeling
is totally normal. It's OK.

17:08.903 --> 17:12.114
But you gotta tell us what happened.

17:13.199 --> 17:15.701
- Elton John.
- Huh?

17:15.742 --> 17:19.371
My mother played
his greatest hits all the time.

17:19.413 --> 17:23.041
His voice would get really high.

17:23.083 --> 17:27.087
If I could sing like he could, I would.
But I can't, so I learnt to play.

17:27.128 --> 17:29.840
How old were you when you first had sex?

17:32.426 --> 17:34.720
I haven't yet.

17:35.721 --> 17:38.015
Mr Holt didn't...?

17:39.933 --> 17:43.604
Evan, Mr Holt hurt you.

17:43.645 --> 17:47.316
No. He didn't.

17:47.357 --> 17:49.526
He's never touched you?

17:49.568 --> 17:55.949
Never. He... He pushed me.
He raised the bar and I met it each time.

18:02.789 --> 18:06.501
- He doesn't know he was taped.
- We should show him.

18:06.543 --> 18:10.797
- We can't take away this kid's denial.
- There are people...

18:10.839 --> 18:16.011
For as much pain as he's been through
there is an equal amount waiting.

18:17.637 --> 18:21.099
Is it enough to try Holt for
possessing and promoting child porn?

18:21.141 --> 18:22.934
He's guilty of a lot more.

18:22.976 --> 18:27.105
Possession, promoting and EWC
will only bring seven years.

18:27.147 --> 18:29.941
A jury's gotta see the tape.

18:29.983 --> 18:33.695
Seeing that tape
is gonna wreck that child's life.

18:33.737 --> 18:38.533
Eliot, he is not a child. He's an adult.

18:47.542 --> 18:51.463
Hello, Evan. May I have a seat?

18:51.504 --> 18:52.964
Yeah.

18:54.257 --> 18:59.137
Erm, what you're gonna see
is gonna be very hard for you.

18:59.179 --> 19:04.142
What happened on this tape is wrong
and the man should be punished.

19:04.184 --> 19:08.271
We can't do that without
the other person on the tape.

19:11.441 --> 19:15.320
- 'Are you ready to start?'
- 'Play it with me.'

19:15.361 --> 19:18.072
'OK. All right, let's move the bench.

19:18.114 --> 19:20.825
'Move the bench out.'

19:20.867 --> 19:23.286
What's this?

19:23.328 --> 19:27.540
'Watch your tempo.
Arch your fingers. Hm-hm.

19:27.582 --> 19:30.460
'Now remember your posture.

19:30.501 --> 19:33.755
'Keep your shoulders back.'

19:35.631 --> 19:38.509
No. No. Turn it off.

19:38.551 --> 19:41.429
- No.
- OK, son. It's all right.

19:41.471 --> 19:43.723
- No.
- Shh. Evan.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.184
No.

19:57.570 --> 19:59.864
No.

20:04.243 --> 20:07.955
Holt moves into the neighbourhood
and blends in.

20:07.997 --> 20:12.251
He stood out.
It's exactly what these kids like Evan need.

20:12.293 --> 20:15.796
- Somebody to love them.
- Be a part of his world.

20:16.714 --> 20:19.341
Rich, educated.

20:19.383 --> 20:21.677
White.

20:21.719 --> 20:24.722
- What did he do?
- He didn't do anything.

20:24.763 --> 20:27.016
Then why are you here?

20:27.057 --> 20:31.312
- Have you ever heard your son play piano?
- Sure, you know.

20:31.353 --> 20:34.857
- He's real good.
- Yeah. So?

20:34.899 --> 20:37.276
That's what we're here for.

20:37.318 --> 20:40.279
If you're from that fancy school,

20:40.321 --> 20:44.158
you better talk to him
about who's gonna pay for this.

20:45.743 --> 20:48.454
How'd the audition go?

20:49.955 --> 20:53.250
Can you tell us who these other kids are?

20:53.292 --> 20:55.544
Yeah. Er, my mom...

20:55.586 --> 20:57.629
Hey. Families.

20:57.671 --> 21:01.508
You know, it's not like Larry's place, huh?

21:01.550 --> 21:04.011
We've been there.

21:04.052 --> 21:06.597
The cabinet store's closed.

21:06.638 --> 21:11.268
There's a piano at the middle school.
It's missing a D flat.

21:11.310 --> 21:15.647
- Holt's got a nice piano.
- There's a price for everything.

21:15.689 --> 21:20.777
- We need you to tell us who these kids are.
- Holt's my teacher.

21:21.862 --> 21:24.740
And he cares about me a lot.

21:24.781 --> 21:28.618
- He bought me a coat one year.
- It's hard but it's OK.

21:28.660 --> 21:30.328
No, it's not.

21:30.370 --> 21:34.124
If you don't help,
Holt goes back to giving lessons.

21:34.166 --> 21:39.004
Holt always said I wasn't ready to leave.
I'm no Rey Guzimano.

21:39.045 --> 21:43.675
You know how old he was
when he came out with his first CD? 17.

21:43.717 --> 21:45.969
- So what?
- How old am I?

21:46.011 --> 21:47.387
Almost 21.

21:47.429 --> 21:50.432
- Some prodigy.
- Juilliard took in

21:50.473 --> 21:54.853
- a 41-year-old flute player last fall.
- The guy was a monk.

21:54.894 --> 21:56.771
It's not too late.

21:57.647 --> 22:00.150
It's not?

22:03.862 --> 22:07.741
That's Cesar.
Do you know where he is? Jail.

22:07.782 --> 22:12.871
His gun accidentally went off when
a dry-cleaner opened his cash register.

22:12.912 --> 22:18.459
That's Ricky. He's a junkie.
Ah, that's Tony. Know where he is?

22:20.420 --> 22:23.256
Nobody does. And me?

22:23.298 --> 22:25.967
You know, I still live here.

22:26.009 --> 22:28.094
But that's OK.

22:29.220 --> 22:32.515
- Holt didn't have a computer.
- No evidence.

22:32.557 --> 22:34.309
No schedule.

22:34.350 --> 22:37.228
- The tapes have dates.
- Dates of lessons.

22:37.270 --> 22:39.313
His current students?

22:39.355 --> 22:41.441
Nobody's talking.

22:41.482 --> 22:46.821
We've indicted Holt separately
for abuse against Evan on two counts.

22:46.863 --> 22:50.074
- What?
- We could only go back five years.

22:50.116 --> 22:51.868
That law was changed in '96.

22:51.909 --> 22:56.289
Child abuse can be prosecuted
up to five years after the 18th birthday.

22:56.330 --> 22:58.291
That's more than two counts.

22:58.332 --> 23:01.544
There's no grandfather clause before '96.

23:01.586 --> 23:05.631
What Holt did to Evan
until he was 16 is inadmissible.

23:05.673 --> 23:07.800
Everything over 17...

23:07.842 --> 23:09.885
Is consensual.

23:09.927 --> 23:12.179
That's only one year.

23:12.221 --> 23:14.765
- That's all we have.
- We may not have that.

23:14.807 --> 23:17.476
What? He may not even testify?

23:17.518 --> 23:20.146
He's afraid of betraying Holt.

23:20.187 --> 23:24.400
- He's worried people will hate him.
- Talk to Evan's friends.

23:24.442 --> 23:27.403
Cesar the lifer or Ricky the junkie?

23:28.779 --> 23:31.657
Oh, boy.

23:31.699 --> 23:34.034
No, nothing ever happened.

23:34.076 --> 23:36.954
- He never touched you?
- No.

23:36.996 --> 23:39.957
Why did you stop playing piano?

23:39.999 --> 23:46.839
I didn't have the technique or discipline.
Man, it's cold.

23:46.880 --> 23:51.093
Why don't you come back
to the station with me and get warm?

23:51.135 --> 23:55.681
Holt's place was always warm.
The door was never locked.

23:55.723 --> 23:57.558
Never?

23:58.559 --> 24:02.604
If it was, I'd come back, go inside,

24:02.646 --> 24:06.775
get warm, eat a meal, a sugar cookie.

24:08.318 --> 24:10.112
I miss that part.

24:16.326 --> 24:19.997
- You're his most successful student.
- I owe him a lot.

24:20.038 --> 24:22.457
You owe it to the community to testify.

24:22.499 --> 24:25.419
- I don't owe them.
- You're still part of it.

24:25.460 --> 24:29.131
- I go to see my mom.
- Holt got away with it for 20 years.

24:29.172 --> 24:33.009
He was the only one to tell me
I could do something, you know?

24:33.051 --> 24:35.595
Yeah. Yeah, I do.

24:35.637 --> 24:38.723
There's only three ways
to get out of there.

24:38.765 --> 24:44.020
You're smart enough to figure it out,
you get it on your own, which isn't me,

24:44.062 --> 24:47.149
or you die there, or you do somethin'.

24:47.190 --> 24:50.402
You know, handle a ball, play the piano.

24:50.443 --> 24:53.947
No one's gonna take that away from me.

24:55.448 --> 25:00.954
- Why won't you talk to me?
- Because he's my father.

25:11.214 --> 25:15.009
- Are you still here?
- Yeah.

25:15.051 --> 25:16.594
Can you sleep?

25:16.636 --> 25:21.224
I close my eyes, I see those tapes.
Every frame.

25:21.266 --> 25:22.934
- Go home, John.
- Yeah.

25:22.976 --> 25:28.731
Back to dead people.
Homicide. It's much more clear cut. Simple.

25:28.773 --> 25:32.360
Back to photographs,
bodies bent and broken.

25:32.402 --> 25:36.114
Bodies that don't talk back to you,
look at you.

25:36.155 --> 25:39.826
- You don't get attached.
- Exactly.

25:39.867 --> 25:42.537
Of course, you retired in Baltimore.

25:42.578 --> 25:47.083
A few months later you found yourself here.
Another squad room and case.

25:47.125 --> 25:51.129
- This time I'll do a better job of quitting.
- Running's good.

25:53.506 --> 25:56.425
I don't need this.

25:56.467 --> 26:00.429
Go home, John. Take care of yourself.

26:03.432 --> 26:06.561
I got two more tapes to watch.

26:08.229 --> 26:10.022
'With a twist of his head...'

26:10.064 --> 26:14.902
- 'He told me I had nothing to dread.'
- 'He spoke not, went to his work.'

26:14.944 --> 26:19.865
- 'And filled the stockings...'
- Will our stockings be filled tonight?

26:19.907 --> 26:23.119
Christmas comes once a year.

26:23.160 --> 26:25.996
It is February. Give me the phone.

26:26.038 --> 26:30.251
- Why, Daddy? Why?
- Why can't Christmas come all the time?

26:30.292 --> 26:35.005
Because Santa's credit cards
are all maxed out, that's why.

26:36.090 --> 26:39.426
Stabler. Hey, Evan! How are you doin'?

26:39.468 --> 26:42.221
- Evan?
- Yeah, Evan. Shh. What?

26:42.263 --> 26:45.474
OK. I'll tell you what, you just stay there.

26:45.516 --> 26:50.729
No. Stay there
and I'll be there as soon as I can.

26:50.771 --> 26:52.439
OK.

26:54.274 --> 26:56.819
My mom threw me out.

26:56.860 --> 27:00.781
She doesn't want
some faggot living at her place.

27:00.823 --> 27:03.742
- I didn't know who else to call.
- It's OK.

27:03.784 --> 27:06.370
I hate that everything's always OK.

27:07.663 --> 27:11.500
I know some places
that give emergency housing

27:11.542 --> 27:14.503
that can help you get on your feet.

27:14.545 --> 27:18.674
- How's the job?
- The hot water cracks my skin.

27:18.715 --> 27:21.176
It hurt my hands.

27:21.218 --> 27:25.472
- You've quit the dishwashing business?
- No. I got fired.

27:32.145 --> 27:34.815
I think I want to testify.

27:34.856 --> 27:37.025
That's good.

27:37.067 --> 27:39.444
Real good.

27:41.321 --> 27:43.865
Do you think I'm gay?

27:45.409 --> 27:48.537
I don't know. It's not for me to say.

27:48.578 --> 27:51.665
I mean, I've never had a girlfriend.

27:51.706 --> 27:53.875
Maybe you don't know yet.

27:53.917 --> 27:57.712
It's not something you choose.
There's a big difference

27:57.754 --> 28:01.007
between homosexuality and paedophilia.

28:01.049 --> 28:03.677
Which is what?

28:03.718 --> 28:09.808
Which is homosexuality is none of
my business. What was done to you...

28:09.849 --> 28:13.228
I was forced.
That's what you're trying to say.

28:13.269 --> 28:18.316
Yeah. Only, erm...

28:18.358 --> 28:22.362
Why didn't you stop taking those lessons?

28:25.448 --> 28:27.909
I thought...

28:28.993 --> 28:31.746
I didn't think I had any choice.

28:36.209 --> 28:39.712
Well, whatever person you choose,

28:39.754 --> 28:42.674
it should be your choice.

28:42.715 --> 28:48.012
My guess is, when you're ready
to see someone that way, you will.

28:49.097 --> 28:52.809
It'll mean something to you.
It'll come from you.

28:52.850 --> 28:57.438
- It won't be about what was done to you.
- And it won't be my fault?

28:59.774 --> 29:04.028
Fault? It's supposed to be about love.

29:19.752 --> 29:22.588
Elliot, are you all right?

29:24.048 --> 29:25.883
Yeah.

29:28.219 --> 29:30.471
How's it goin'?

29:34.767 --> 29:36.852
Going?

29:39.396 --> 29:41.899
What's going on at work?

29:44.318 --> 29:46.403
Nothin'.

29:48.697 --> 29:51.367
Have you talked to Olivia about it?

29:54.954 --> 29:57.456
She's my partner.

30:06.423 --> 30:09.051
How can we make Evan feel comfortable?

30:09.093 --> 30:13.138
- We just spent two hours rehearsing.
- How'd it go?

30:13.180 --> 30:17.935
He answers questions
as if there was a right answer.

30:17.976 --> 30:20.521
- Just like a kid.
- He is.

30:20.562 --> 30:25.192
Emotionally, sexually.
This kid shut down at eight years of age.

30:25.234 --> 30:29.321
When kids are on the stand
I do a courtroom prep.

30:29.404 --> 30:31.865
Cool!

30:31.907 --> 30:34.159
OK, that's enough.

30:34.201 --> 30:37.412
Last and most important,
where you will sit.

30:37.454 --> 30:39.623
I don't get to come here at all?

30:39.665 --> 30:44.169
You might get contaminated
by watching the whole trial.

30:44.211 --> 30:45.462
Contaminated?

30:45.504 --> 30:49.007
You got better things to do
than hang out here.

30:49.049 --> 30:54.721
When you're up here I want you to
answer the questions like we practised.

30:54.763 --> 30:59.309
When you answer I want you
to look at me and only at me.

30:59.351 --> 31:02.062
And when his lawyer asks me questions?

31:02.103 --> 31:05.690
Answer the questions.
Everything else ignore.

31:07.734 --> 31:10.028
Just hear music.

31:14.324 --> 31:16.409
Hey, John.

31:21.164 --> 31:26.169
- Do you think it was a conscious choice?
- What? Holt?

31:26.211 --> 31:30.215
- Yeah, Holt. What makes a perp a perp?
- Who cares?

31:30.256 --> 31:34.886
Some say our frontal lobe
is our body's armour against impulses.

31:34.928 --> 31:38.681
- So Holt has a bad lobe.
- Do you think he was abused?

31:38.723 --> 31:42.435
I really don't care.
It's just another excuse.

31:42.477 --> 31:46.648
This guy hurt a lot of kids.
That's what I care about.

31:49.776 --> 31:52.654
What's going on with you?

32:00.036 --> 32:02.914
I got something to show you.

32:02.955 --> 32:08.044
'That's good. Keep your wrists up.'

32:10.296 --> 32:14.884
'No, no. Evan, he's having trouble
with the music.'

32:18.179 --> 32:20.348
'He doesn't feel it.'

32:22.391 --> 32:26.103
'He's ready to start learning. He's ready.'

32:34.278 --> 32:36.781
'Can you show him?'

32:46.040 --> 32:50.294
'What are you doing?'
'Just keep playing.'

33:08.771 --> 33:12.274
- Hasn't he been through enough?
- How can you say that?

33:12.316 --> 33:16.278
When we watched those tapes,
you wanted to throttle the guy.

33:16.320 --> 33:19.198
You told Evan everything would be OK.

33:19.239 --> 33:23.827
- It is OK if he's the victim, not the abuser.
- He's both.

33:23.869 --> 33:27.873
Who's next? If Evan hurts another kid,
we are responsible.

33:27.915 --> 33:30.459
In a few years he'll be another Holt.

33:32.669 --> 33:37.424
Well, the same laws that bind Holt
bind Evan too.

33:37.466 --> 33:43.013
Mark, it's Don Cragen.
I think you better get down here right away.

33:43.055 --> 33:47.601
Larry said
that Jonathan didn't feel the music.

33:47.642 --> 33:54.274
He said, 'How can you play a piece
about longing when you haven't felt that?'

33:54.316 --> 33:58.320
Jonathan was playing The Entertainer.

33:59.362 --> 34:01.698
It's the way I learned how to play.

34:02.616 --> 34:06.036
What are you gonna do
with your talent now?

34:07.120 --> 34:09.164
Look at me.

34:09.206 --> 34:11.498
Look at me.

34:13.001 --> 34:15.962
How many times did this happen?

34:16.004 --> 34:19.674
- Once. That's it.
- Don't lie to me.

34:19.716 --> 34:22.927
That was the only time.

34:24.054 --> 34:27.806
- You committed a crime.
- I deserve to be punished.

34:30.185 --> 34:33.521
Do you still wanna testify tomorrow?

34:36.190 --> 34:40.445
You're going to be arraigned this afternoon.

34:40.487 --> 34:41.905
Am I going to jail?

34:43.947 --> 34:46.826
We probably could make a deal.

34:52.040 --> 34:53.248
What?

34:53.291 --> 34:56.668
You don't think it's fair
we give this kid a deal.

34:56.710 --> 35:00.006
Fair? I don't know what I know any more.

35:00.048 --> 35:03.760
Yeah? We're stuck
in the middle of this thing.

35:03.801 --> 35:08.973
We saw him being subjected to things
that no child should ever suffer.

35:09.015 --> 35:11.893
What kid? Jonathan or Evan?

35:11.934 --> 35:16.689
Point taken. I meant Evan.
He was abused and then he does it.

35:16.731 --> 35:20.443
- Some excuse.
- Do you think that's all it is?

35:20.484 --> 35:25.114
I think it relieves him
of an awful lot of responsibility.

35:25.156 --> 35:29.785
The idea that abuse begets abuse
is a rationalisation

35:29.827 --> 35:34.749
that countless defence lawyers use,
but in this case it is true.

35:34.790 --> 35:37.043
He had a choice.

35:37.084 --> 35:40.588
- Yes, Evan the adult did.
- He committed a crime.

35:40.629 --> 35:43.716
We're cops and we'll deal with that.

35:43.758 --> 35:47.678
But what's eatin' you is Evan the little boy.

35:47.720 --> 35:52.224
The boy on the tape.
What choice did he have?

36:04.278 --> 36:06.655
- Bail is 25,000.
- Your Honour.

36:06.697 --> 36:08.490
That's more than fair.

36:08.532 --> 36:14.747
We appreciate the court's generosity,
but may we approach the bench?

36:18.333 --> 36:21.003
My client can't make that.

36:21.045 --> 36:23.964
So he spends the night in jail.

36:24.006 --> 36:27.009
The People are trying Larry Holt.

36:27.050 --> 36:28.969
Evan is our key witness.

36:29.011 --> 36:31.680
When is he testifying?

36:31.722 --> 36:36.810
Tomorrow. The stress of a night in jail
would probably affect his testimony.

36:36.852 --> 36:39.938
All right. Until his testimony is completed

36:39.980 --> 36:43.442
I'll release Evan
into the custody of the People.

36:53.577 --> 36:58.665
- You hate me, don't you?
- I don't hate you.

37:04.921 --> 37:09.217
- What you said at the diner that night...
- That was before.

37:09.718 --> 37:11.761
Look,

37:11.803 --> 37:15.015
what happened to you is terrible.

37:15.056 --> 37:20.437
I look at you and try seeing
that little child being abused.

37:20.478 --> 37:23.315
Only, erm...

37:23.356 --> 37:25.650
Now you see an abuser.

37:25.692 --> 37:27.944
Yeah.

37:27.986 --> 37:32.282
I do. I see a guy that
if you ever came near my child...

37:44.377 --> 37:49.424
My kid must have put that in there.
He wants Christmas to come every night.

37:58.933 --> 38:03.396
''Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the house

38:03.438 --> 38:06.774
'not a creature was stirring,
not even a mouse.'

38:07.567 --> 38:09.068
Don't.

38:17.660 --> 38:22.290
'When I would play he would sit
next to me on the bench.'

38:22.331 --> 38:26.043
- Uh-huh. Why?
- It made it easy to turn the music.

38:26.085 --> 38:28.462
Did he ever touch you?

38:28.504 --> 38:34.093
Yes. He would keep his hand
on my back for good posture.

38:34.135 --> 38:39.348
Evan, did he ever touch you
anywhere else?

38:51.819 --> 38:54.113
Yes.

39:01.537 --> 39:05.958
During the trial,
I heard from the prosecution and defence,

39:06.000 --> 39:09.795
but not from you, Mr Holt.
Do you want to say something now?

39:09.837 --> 39:11.839
No, Your Honour.

39:11.880 --> 39:16.760
Hm. Er, I've read the pre-sentencing report.

39:16.802 --> 39:21.974
Nothing in it indicates
you feel... any remorse.

39:22.016 --> 39:25.477
Nothing indicates that I should be lenient.

39:25.519 --> 39:31.150
Mr Holt, note by note you eroded the hope

39:31.191 --> 39:34.278
of every child in your charge.

39:34.319 --> 39:38.907
You stole from them.
You stole from this community.

39:38.949 --> 39:43.036
I sentence you
to one hundred and fifteen years,

39:43.078 --> 39:46.832
the maximum the law allows.
Maybe knowing

39:46.873 --> 39:52.546
that you will never teach another child
will fill some of us again with hope.

39:56.550 --> 39:59.720
Will he really be in jail that long?

39:59.761 --> 40:03.724
Well, he'll be eligible for parole in 38 years.

40:03.765 --> 40:08.270
- But he's almost 60.
- Yeah. Isn't math wonderful?

40:19.990 --> 40:21.324
Absolutely not.

40:21.366 --> 40:24.578
I'm trying to spare your son
the ordeal of testifying.

40:24.619 --> 40:27.330
If he doesn't testify, he goes free.

40:27.372 --> 40:30.667
He's pleading guilty.
He will be on probation.

40:30.709 --> 40:34.004
- Heavily supervised.
- My son is the victim.

40:34.045 --> 40:37.340
We know that.
We are not trying to excuse Evan.

40:37.382 --> 40:41.302
But this goes back to Holt.
You saw how fast the jury was.

40:41.344 --> 40:45.265
- I want that other kid to go to trial.
- I know you do.

40:45.306 --> 40:48.017
And I sympathise with you, believe me.

40:48.059 --> 40:53.189
Isn't the most important thing here
that these men never do this again?

40:53.231 --> 40:57.360
That's not justice.
It's special laws for special people.

40:57.402 --> 41:00.363
Not at all. It's almost a done deal.

41:00.405 --> 41:04.325
Undo it. If you don't,
I'll call every newspaper,

41:04.367 --> 41:08.454
every TV station and tell them
how certain child molesters

41:08.496 --> 41:14.085
are worth your time and energy
and how certain other ones aren't.

41:17.004 --> 41:19.215
What's that?

41:19.257 --> 41:21.509
It's a letter from Juilliard.

41:22.802 --> 41:24.887
Have you opened it?

41:29.225 --> 41:32.728
- Congratulations.
- If Evan pleads guilty,

41:32.770 --> 41:35.982
- we don't go to trial.
- They won't cut a deal.

41:36.023 --> 41:38.109
How long would I be in jail?

41:38.150 --> 41:43.656
The felony carries one to three years.
A judge will give you the maximum.

41:43.698 --> 41:48.703
If we go to trial,
we'll probably wind up with probation.

41:48.744 --> 41:52.373
- If we withdraw our guilty plea...
- No.

41:52.415 --> 41:56.877
- Jonathan can't go through that.
- You'll get three years.

42:01.340 --> 42:05.511
Look, I don't know
what made Holt the way he is.

42:07.596 --> 42:12.434
But I do know why I am the way I am.

42:13.519 --> 42:17.481
And it stops here. Now.
