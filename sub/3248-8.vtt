00:00.384 --> 00:03.740
Close your eyes and
tell me what you see.

00:09.800 --> 00:11.235
The Library.

00:17.100 --> 00:19.680
Open your eyes again.

00:19.715 --> 00:22.225
Where are you now?

00:22.260 --> 00:24.639
My living room, Dr Moon.

00:24.674 --> 00:27.019
When you close your eyes...

00:27.054 --> 00:28.659
I go to the Library.

00:30.820 --> 00:32.979
Go to the Library now.

00:34.580 --> 00:37.060
Are you back there? Yes.

00:37.820 --> 00:39.624
The same part?

00:39.659 --> 00:42.119
No, it's always different.

00:42.154 --> 00:44.580
The Library goes on for ever.

00:44.615 --> 00:47.420
How you do move around?

00:47.455 --> 00:49.704
By wishing.

00:52.419 --> 00:54.704
What's wrong? Something's here!

00:54.739 --> 01:00.900
Someone's got in!
No-one's supposed to get in!

01:00.935 --> 01:03.465
Someone's in my library.

01:03.500 --> 01:05.900
No! No, please! That's not allowed!

01:05.935 --> 01:08.585
Listen to me.

01:08.620 --> 01:10.544
The Library is in your mind.

01:10.579 --> 01:13.179
I know it's in my mind.
But something's got inside!

01:24.819 --> 01:26.905
Oh! Hello!

01:26.940 --> 01:29.099
Sorry to burst in on you like this.

01:29.134 --> 01:30.579
OK if we stop here for a bit?

02:09.658 --> 02:14.780
Books! People never really stop
loving books.

02:17.619 --> 02:21.740
By now you've got holovids, direct
to brain downloads, fiction mist,

02:21.775 --> 02:25.740
but you need the smell. The smell
of books, Donna. Deep breath.

02:29.660 --> 02:31.260
The Library.

02:32.859 --> 02:34.860
So big it doesn't need a name.

02:34.895 --> 02:36.339
Just a great big "the."

02:36.374 --> 02:37.904
It's like a city.

02:37.939 --> 02:40.304
It's a world. Literally a world.

02:40.339 --> 02:43.740
The core of the planet
is the index computer,
biggest hard drive ever.

02:43.775 --> 02:46.145
And up here,
every book ever written.

02:46.180 --> 02:52.659
Whole continents of
Jeffrey Archer, Bridget Jones,
Monty Python's Big Red Book.

02:52.694 --> 02:54.819
Brand new editions,
specially printed.

02:57.140 --> 02:59.139
We're near the equator, so...

03:00.900 --> 03:03.140
..this must be Biographies!

03:03.175 --> 03:05.145
I love biographies.

03:05.180 --> 03:07.345
Yeah, very you.
Always a death at the end.

03:07.380 --> 03:10.660
You need a good death. Without
death, there'd only be comedies.

03:10.695 --> 03:13.060
Dying gives us size. Oi!

03:13.095 --> 03:15.425
Spoilers! What?

03:15.460 --> 03:19.260
These books are from your future.
Don't read ahead -
spoil all the surprises.

03:19.295 --> 03:24.060
Like peeking at the end. Isn't
travelling with you one big spoiler?

03:24.095 --> 03:28.019
I try to keep you away
from major plot developments.

03:28.054 --> 03:30.625
Which, to be honest,
I seem to be very bad at,

03:30.660 --> 03:34.500
cos you know what? This is the
biggest library in the universe.

03:36.059 --> 03:37.540
So where is everyone?

03:41.940 --> 03:45.459
It's silent. The Library?

03:48.860 --> 03:53.979
The planet.

03:55.699 --> 03:57.985
Maybe it's a Sunday.

03:58.020 --> 04:00.459
No, I never land on Sundays.

04:00.494 --> 04:02.864
Sundays are boring. Well...

04:02.899 --> 04:07.019
Maybe everyone's really,
really quiet.

04:07.054 --> 04:08.505
Yeah, maybe.

04:08.540 --> 04:11.320
But they'd still show up
on the system.

04:11.355 --> 04:14.100
Doctor, why are we here?
Really, why?

04:14.135 --> 04:16.459
Oh, you know, just passing.

04:16.495 --> 04:18.345
No, seriously.

04:18.380 --> 04:21.779
It was all, "Let's hit the beach,"
then suddenly we're in a library.

04:21.815 --> 04:24.117
Why? Now, that's interesting.

04:24.152 --> 04:26.384
What? Scanning for life forms.

04:26.419 --> 04:28.665
If I do a scan looking
for your basic humanoids -

04:28.700 --> 04:32.220
your book readers,
few limbs and a face -
apart from us, I get nothing.

04:32.255 --> 04:34.665
Zippo, nada, see?

04:34.700 --> 04:39.820
Nobody home. But if I widen the
parameters to any kind of life...

04:43.820 --> 04:45.880
A million million.

04:45.915 --> 04:47.940
Gives up after that.

04:49.820 --> 04:52.105
A million million.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.220
But there's nothing here.

04:54.255 --> 04:56.777
There's no-one.

04:56.812 --> 04:59.300
And not a sound.

05:01.220 --> 05:03.700
A million million life forms

05:03.735 --> 05:06.180
and silence in the Library.

05:07.779 --> 05:10.305
But there's no-one here.

05:10.340 --> 05:13.580
There's just books.
I mean, it's not the books, is it?

05:13.615 --> 05:15.459
I mean, it can't be
the books, can it?

05:15.494 --> 05:17.940
I mean, books can't be alive?

05:28.980 --> 05:30.459
Welcome!

05:33.220 --> 05:35.859
That came from in there, yeah. Yeah!

05:49.340 --> 05:53.385
I am Courtesy Node 710/aqua.

05:53.420 --> 05:57.760
Please enjoy the Library and respect
the personal access codes

05:57.795 --> 06:02.100
of all your fellow readers regardless
of species or hygiene taboo.

06:02.135 --> 06:04.197
That face, it looks real.

06:04.232 --> 06:06.224
Yeah, don't worry about it.

06:06.259 --> 06:08.780
But a statue with a real face,
though!

06:08.815 --> 06:10.417
It's a hologram, isn't it?

06:10.452 --> 06:11.984
No, but really, it's fine.

06:12.019 --> 06:17.839
There follows a brief message
from the head librarian
for your urgent attention.

06:17.874 --> 06:23.660
It has been edited for tone and
content by a Felman Lux Automated
Decency Filter.

06:23.695 --> 06:25.957
Message follows. "Run.

06:25.992 --> 06:28.186
"For God's sake, run.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.345
"Nowhere is safe.

06:30.380 --> 06:36.260
"The Library has sealed itself,
we can't... Oh, they're here.

06:36.295 --> 06:40.264
"Arg. Slarg. Snick." Message ends.

06:40.299 --> 06:45.419
Please switch off your mobile
comm units for the comfort
of other readers.

06:45.454 --> 06:48.184
So that's why we're here.

06:48.219 --> 06:52.665
Any other messages, same date stamp?
One additional message.

06:52.700 --> 06:56.820
This message carries a Felman Lux
coherency warning of 5, 0, 11...

06:56.855 --> 06:58.899
Yeah, yeah, fine, just play it.

06:58.934 --> 07:00.996
Message follows.

07:01.031 --> 07:03.024
"Count the shadows.

07:03.059 --> 07:04.784
"For God's sake, remember...

07:04.819 --> 07:07.180
"if you want to live,
count the shadows."

07:07.215 --> 07:09.699
Message ends.

07:13.380 --> 07:16.199
Donna...

07:16.234 --> 07:18.984
Yeah?

07:19.019 --> 07:20.580
Stay out of the shadows.

07:22.299 --> 07:24.060
Why, what's in the shadows?

07:42.539 --> 07:44.385
So...

07:44.420 --> 07:47.140
We weren't just
in the neighbourhood.

07:47.175 --> 07:49.577
Yeah, I kind of, sort of lied a bit.

07:49.612 --> 07:51.979
I got a message
on the psychic paper.

07:53.779 --> 07:56.739
What do you think - cry for help?

07:56.774 --> 07:59.516
Cry for help with a kiss?

07:59.551 --> 08:02.265
Oh, we've all done that.

08:02.300 --> 08:04.944
Who's it from? No idea.

08:04.979 --> 08:08.100
So why did we come here,
why did you..? Donna.

08:10.340 --> 08:14.345
What's happening? Run!

08:14.380 --> 08:17.660
What, is it locked?
Jammed! The wood's warped!

08:18.860 --> 08:21.104
Sonic it, use the thingy!

08:21.139 --> 08:24.079
I can't, it's wood!
What, it doesn't do wood?!

08:24.114 --> 08:26.985
If I can vibrate the molecules,
fry the bindings,

08:27.020 --> 08:29.979
I can shatterline the interface.
Oh, get out of the way!

08:39.140 --> 08:41.464
Oh! Hello!

08:41.499 --> 08:45.139
OK if we stop here for a bit?

08:47.739 --> 08:51.024
What is it?

08:51.059 --> 08:53.699
Security camera.

08:53.734 --> 08:56.340
Switched itself off.

08:59.940 --> 09:04.140
They were in my library.
How can they be in my library?
Who were they?

09:04.175 --> 09:08.340
What's that? What's that noise?
What noise?

09:10.299 --> 09:12.745
Nice door skills, Donna.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.704
Yeah, well, you know, boyfriends...

09:14.739 --> 09:18.265
sometimes you need the element
of surprise. What was that,

09:18.300 --> 09:22.820
what was after us? I mean, did
we just run away from a power cut?

09:22.855 --> 09:23.940
Possibly.

09:26.699 --> 09:30.539
Are we safe here? Course
we're safe. There's a little shop.

09:36.819 --> 09:38.860
Gotcha!

09:40.059 --> 09:43.980
No, stop it, no, no!

09:46.620 --> 09:48.264
Ooh, I'm sorry.

09:48.299 --> 09:52.300
I really am, I'm sorry,
I'm so sorry. It's alive.

09:52.335 --> 09:54.540
You said it was a security camera.

09:54.575 --> 09:56.744
It is.

09:56.779 --> 09:58.759
It's an alive one.

09:58.794 --> 10:00.666
Can you hear me?

10:00.701 --> 10:02.539
Are you all right?

10:05.700 --> 10:09.380
Others are coming.
Who's coming? Who are the others?

10:09.415 --> 10:11.385
The Library is breached.

10:11.420 --> 10:14.104
Others are coming. What others?

10:14.139 --> 10:17.900
Others? What does it mean, "others"?

10:21.139 --> 10:23.625
Excuse me,
what does it mean, "others"?

10:23.660 --> 10:27.420
That's barely more than a speak your
weight machine, it can't help you.

10:27.455 --> 10:28.784
So why's it got a face?

10:28.819 --> 10:34.579
This flesh aspect was donated
by Mark Chambers on the
occasion of his death.

10:34.614 --> 10:36.504
It's a real face?

10:36.539 --> 10:39.585
It has been actualised
individually for you

10:39.620 --> 10:43.380
from the many facial aspects
saved to our extensive flesh banks.

10:43.415 --> 10:45.705
Please enjoy.

10:45.740 --> 10:52.019
It chose me a dead face it thought
I'd like? That statue's got a

10:52.054 --> 10:54.899
That's basically
like donating a park bench.

10:54.934 --> 10:57.339
It's donating a face!

10:57.374 --> 10:58.905
No, wait, no!

10:58.940 --> 11:01.620
Oi! Hands! The shadow, look.

11:03.340 --> 11:07.105
What about it? Count the shadows.

11:07.140 --> 11:11.099
One. There,
I counted it, one shadow.

11:11.134 --> 11:15.300
Yeah... But what's casting it?

11:25.340 --> 11:28.280
Oh! I'm thick!
Look at me, I'm old and thick!

11:28.315 --> 11:31.220
Head's too full of stuff,
I need a bigger head!

11:35.219 --> 11:36.744
Power must be going.

11:36.779 --> 11:39.980
This place runs on fission cells.
They'll outburn the sun.

11:40.015 --> 11:42.699
Then why's it dark? It's not dark.

11:46.740 --> 11:48.700
That shadow.

11:48.735 --> 11:50.625
It's gone.

11:50.660 --> 11:53.305
We need to get back to the TARDIS.
Why?

11:53.340 --> 11:55.944
Because that shadow hasn't gone.
It's moved.

11:55.979 --> 12:00.139
Reminder - the Library has been
breached, others are coming.

12:00.174 --> 12:04.300
Reminder - the Library has been
breached, others are coming.

12:04.335 --> 12:07.059
Reminder -
the Library has been breached...

12:28.300 --> 12:30.300
Hello, sweetie.

12:30.335 --> 12:32.265
Get out. Doctor?

12:32.300 --> 12:34.785
Get back in your rocket
and fly away.

12:34.820 --> 12:38.100
Tell your grandchildren you
came to the Library and lived,
they won't believe you.

12:38.135 --> 12:41.544
Pop your helmets, everyone.
We've got breathers.

12:41.579 --> 12:45.180
How do you know they're not
androids? Cos I've dated androids.

12:45.215 --> 12:46.665
They're rubbish. Who is this?

12:46.700 --> 12:50.305
You said we were the only
expedition, I paid for exclusives.

12:50.340 --> 12:55.299
I lied, I'm always lying.
Bound to be others. Miss Evangelista,
I want to see the contracts.

12:55.334 --> 12:57.745
You came through the north door?
Much damage?

12:57.780 --> 13:02.619
Please, just leave. I'm asking you
seriously and properly, just lea...
Did you say expedition?

13:02.654 --> 13:04.665
My expedition, I funded it.

13:04.700 --> 13:08.900
Oh, you're not, are you? Tell me
you're not archaeologists.

13:08.935 --> 13:10.744
Got a problem with archaeologists?

13:10.779 --> 13:15.379
I'm a time traveller. I point
and laugh at archaeologists. Ah!

13:15.414 --> 13:17.540
Professor River Song, archaeologist.

13:17.575 --> 13:19.304
Lovely name. As you're leaving,

13:19.339 --> 13:21.864
you need to set up
a quarantine beacon.

13:21.899 --> 13:26.460
Code-wall the planet,
the whole planet.
Nobody comes here, not ever again.

13:26.495 --> 13:29.859
Stop right there!
What's your name? Anita.

13:29.894 --> 13:31.464
Anita, stay out of the shadows.

13:31.499 --> 13:34.940
Not a finger in the shadows till
you're safely back in your ship.

13:34.975 --> 13:39.140
Stay in the light. Find a nice,
bright spot and just stand.

13:39.175 --> 13:42.180
If you understand me,
look very, very scared.

13:47.539 --> 13:50.180
No, bit more scared than that.

13:52.140 --> 13:55.785
OK, do for now. You, who are you?
Er, Dave. OK, Dave...

13:55.820 --> 14:02.460
Oh, well Other Dave, because
that's Proper Dave the pilot,
he was the first Dave, so when we...

14:02.495 --> 14:05.700
The way you came, does it look
the same as before? Yeah.

14:05.735 --> 14:07.024
Oh, it's a bit darker.

14:07.059 --> 14:11.259
How much darker? I could see
where we came through just
a moment ago. I can't now.

14:11.294 --> 14:13.065
Seal the door.

14:13.100 --> 14:16.339
We're not looking for a way out.
Miss Evangelista?

14:16.374 --> 14:19.705
I'm Mr Lux's personal...everything.

14:19.740 --> 14:23.379
Sign these contracts agreeing that
your experiences inside the Library

14:23.414 --> 14:28.260
are the intellectual property
of the Felman Lux Corporation.

14:28.295 --> 14:31.419
Right, give it here.
Yeah, lovely. Thanks.

14:32.620 --> 14:35.784
My family built this library.
I have rights.

14:35.819 --> 14:39.464
You have a mouth that won't stop.
You think there's danger here?

14:39.499 --> 14:43.620
Something came to this library
and killed everything in it,
killed a whole world.

14:43.655 --> 14:45.784
Danger? Could be.
That was 100 years ago.

14:45.819 --> 14:49.620
The Library's been silent
for 100 years. Whatever came here
is long dead.

14:49.655 --> 14:50.660
Bet your life?

14:50.695 --> 14:52.784
Always.

14:52.819 --> 14:55.585
What are you doing?

14:55.620 --> 14:57.420
He said seal the door. Torch!

14:57.455 --> 14:59.220
You're taking orders from him?

14:59.255 --> 15:00.699
Spooky, isn't it?

15:09.299 --> 15:14.259
Almost every species in the universe
has an irrational fear of the dark.

15:14.294 --> 15:19.460
But they're wrong.
Cos it's not irrational.

15:19.495 --> 15:21.697
It's Vashta Nerada.

15:21.732 --> 15:24.296
What's Vashta Nerada?

15:24.331 --> 15:26.825
It's what's in the dark.

15:26.860 --> 15:28.619
It's what's always in the dark.

15:30.660 --> 15:33.305
Lights! You got lights? What for?

15:33.340 --> 15:37.860
Form a circle, safe area, big as
you can, lights pointing out. Oi!

15:37.895 --> 15:39.740
Do as he says.
You're not listening to him?!

15:39.775 --> 15:41.464
Apparently, I am. Unpack the lights.

15:41.499 --> 15:44.859
Other Dave, make sure the
door's secure, then help Anita.

15:44.894 --> 15:47.425
Mr Lux, put your helmet
back on, block the visor.

15:47.460 --> 15:50.625
Proper Dave, I want you to access
the library database,

15:50.660 --> 15:55.499
see what you can find about what
happened here a hundred years
ago. Pretty Boy, you're with me.

15:55.534 --> 15:57.304
Step into my office.

15:57.339 --> 16:00.339
Professor Song, why am I the
only one wearing my helmet?

16:00.374 --> 16:03.385
I don't fancy you.

16:03.420 --> 16:05.680
Probably, I can help you.

16:05.715 --> 16:07.940
Pretty Boy, with me, I said.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.785
Oh, I'm Pretty Boy? Yes.

16:13.820 --> 16:15.699
Ooh, that came out a bit quick!

16:15.734 --> 16:17.985
Pretty?!

16:18.020 --> 16:20.464
Don't let your shadows cross!

16:20.499 --> 16:23.305
Seriously,
don't even let them touch.

16:23.340 --> 16:26.539
Any of them could be infected.
How can a shadow be infected?

16:26.574 --> 16:27.585
Can I help?

16:27.620 --> 16:29.299
No, we're fine. I could just...

16:29.334 --> 16:31.460
you know, hold things.

16:31.495 --> 16:34.699
Really, we're OK.

16:40.339 --> 16:42.105
Couldn't she help?

16:42.140 --> 16:44.824
I just spent four days on
a ship with that woman. She's...

16:44.859 --> 16:48.140
Couldn't tell the difference between
the escape pod and the bathroom.

16:48.175 --> 16:50.139
We had to go back for her.

16:50.174 --> 16:52.419
Twice.

17:04.220 --> 17:07.898
Thanks. For what?
The usual. For coming when I call.

17:07.934 --> 17:09.584
That was you?

17:09.618 --> 17:13.540
You're doing a good job,
acting like you don't know me.
I'm assume there's a reason.

17:13.575 --> 17:17.019
A fairly good one, actually.
OK, shall we do diaries, then?

17:17.054 --> 17:23.545
Where are we this time?

17:23.579 --> 17:26.220
Crash of the Byzantium...
have we done that yet?

17:28.179 --> 17:32.379
Obviously ringing no bells.

17:32.414 --> 17:35.256
Right, Picnic at Asgard.

17:35.291 --> 17:38.099
Have we done Asgard yet?

17:40.380 --> 17:42.745
Obviously not.

17:42.780 --> 17:45.225
Blimey, very early days, then. Hoo!

17:45.260 --> 17:48.540
Life with a time traveller - never
knew it could be such hard work.

17:53.220 --> 17:54.739
Look at you!

17:57.060 --> 18:00.380
You're young.
I'm really not, you know.

18:00.415 --> 18:01.860
No, but you are.

18:02.780 --> 18:04.459
Your eyes.

18:06.259 --> 18:08.979
You're younger
than I've ever seen you.

18:10.299 --> 18:13.939
You've seen me before, then?

18:15.500 --> 18:17.944
Doctor...

18:17.979 --> 18:20.220
please tell me you know who I am?

18:21.899 --> 18:23.300
Who are you?

18:32.620 --> 18:37.820
Sorry, that was me. Trying to get
through into the security protocols,
I seem to have set something off.

18:37.855 --> 18:41.060
What is that, is that an alarm?
Doctor.

18:41.095 --> 18:43.260
Doctor, that sounds like...

18:43.295 --> 18:44.580
It is. It's a phone!

19:01.779 --> 19:03.344
Dad!

19:03.379 --> 19:06.544
In a minute.

19:10.020 --> 19:13.939
I'm trying to call up the
data core, but it's not responding.

19:13.974 --> 19:16.139
Just that noise. But it's a phone!

19:16.174 --> 19:18.537
Let me try something.

19:20.900 --> 19:24.740
Dad! The phone,
aren't you going to answer it?

19:24.775 --> 19:27.777
It's not ringing, sweetie.

19:40.340 --> 19:43.539
OK, doesn't like that,
let's try something else.

19:54.620 --> 19:55.980
'OK, here it comes.'

19:58.340 --> 20:00.184
Hello?

20:00.219 --> 20:04.059
Hello. Are you in my television?

20:04.094 --> 20:08.025
Well, no, I'm...

20:08.060 --> 20:13.340
I'm sort of in space. I was trying
to call up the data core of a
triple-grid security processor.

20:13.375 --> 20:15.225
Would you like to speak to my dad?

20:15.260 --> 20:18.259
Your dad or your mum,
that would be lovely.

20:20.700 --> 20:22.740
I know you! You were in my library.

20:22.775 --> 20:24.744
YOUR library?

20:24.779 --> 20:27.705
The Library's never been
on the television before.

20:27.740 --> 20:34.579
What have you done? Ah, I...
I just rerouted the interface...

20:34.614 --> 20:38.980
What happened. Who was that?

20:49.419 --> 20:53.019
I need another terminal.
Keep working on those lights,
we need those lights!

20:53.054 --> 20:56.739
You heard him, people,
let there be light.

21:10.499 --> 21:15.900
Sorry. You're not allowed to see
inside the book, it's against
the rules. What rules?

21:15.935 --> 21:17.340
Your rules.

21:44.060 --> 21:45.980
What's that?

21:48.140 --> 21:51.219
I didn't do that, did you do that?
Not me.

21:54.980 --> 21:56.420
What's CAL?

22:15.900 --> 22:17.264
You all right?

22:17.299 --> 22:20.100
What's that? What's happening?

22:20.135 --> 22:21.864
I don't know.

22:21.899 --> 22:23.905
Oh, thanks for...you know...

22:23.940 --> 22:25.700
offering to help with the lights.

22:27.379 --> 22:31.419
They don't want me.
They think I'm stupid cos I'm pretty.

22:31.454 --> 22:34.477
Course they don't,
nobody thinks that.

22:34.512 --> 22:37.465
No, they're right though.
I'm a moron, me.

22:37.500 --> 22:41.700
My dad said I have the IQ
of plankton. And I was pleased.

22:41.735 --> 22:43.699
See, that's funny.

22:45.219 --> 22:48.559
No, I really was pleased.

22:48.594 --> 22:51.900
Is that funny? No, no.

22:54.860 --> 22:58.179
What's causing that?
Is it the little girl?

22:58.214 --> 22:59.704
But who is the little girl?

22:59.739 --> 23:01.420
What's she got to do
with this place?

23:06.380 --> 23:08.620
How does the data core work?
What's the principle?

23:08.655 --> 23:11.300
What's CAL? Ask Mr Lux.

23:11.335 --> 23:13.065
CAL, what is it?

23:13.100 --> 23:17.220
Sorry. You didn't sign your
Personal Experience contracts.

23:17.255 --> 23:19.504
Mr Lux,

23:19.539 --> 23:23.780
right now,
you're in more danger than you've
ever been in your whole life.

23:23.815 --> 23:25.957
And you're protecting a patent?

23:25.992 --> 23:28.100
I'm protecting my family's pride.

23:28.135 --> 23:30.105
Well, funny thing, Mr Lux,

23:30.140 --> 23:33.505
I don't want to see everyone in
this room dead

23:33.540 --> 23:37.939
because some idiot
thinks his pride is more important.

23:37.974 --> 23:41.019
Then why don't you sign his contract?

23:42.660 --> 23:46.419
I didn't either.
I'm getting worse than you.

23:48.940 --> 23:51.265
Let's start at the beginning.
What happened here?

23:51.300 --> 23:55.580
On the actual day, a hundred
years ago, what physically happened?

23:58.500 --> 24:02.664
There was a message from the library.
Just one.

24:02.699 --> 24:08.900
"The lights are going out". Then the
computer sealed the planet and there
was nothing for a hundred years.

24:08.935 --> 24:13.700
It's taken three generations
of my family just to decode
the seals and get back in.

24:13.735 --> 24:16.100
Um...excuse me... Not just now.

24:18.180 --> 24:21.060
There was one other thing
in the last message...

24:21.095 --> 24:23.379
That's confidential.
I trust this man.

24:23.414 --> 24:25.504
With my life, with everything.

24:25.539 --> 24:29.820
You've only just met him.
No, he's only just met me. Erm.

24:31.660 --> 24:33.500
This might be important actually...

24:33.535 --> 24:35.020
In a moment!

24:37.100 --> 24:40.460
This is a data extract
that came with the message.

24:40.495 --> 24:43.500
4022 saved. No survivors.

24:45.380 --> 24:50.899
4022, that's the exact number of
people who were in the Library
when the planet was sealed.

24:50.934 --> 24:54.939
But how can 4022 people have been
saved if there were no survivors?

24:54.974 --> 24:56.944
That's what we're here to find out.

24:56.979 --> 25:00.540
And so far, what we haven't found,
are any bodies.

26:18.740 --> 26:21.424
Everybody, careful.
Stay in the light.

26:21.459 --> 26:24.019
So you keep saying.
I don't see the point! Who screamed?

26:24.054 --> 26:27.225
Miss Evangelista. Where is she?

26:27.260 --> 26:29.420
Miss Evangelista, please
state your current...

26:35.780 --> 26:38.460
Please state your current...

26:38.495 --> 26:40.339
position.

26:51.099 --> 26:53.180
It's her.

26:56.220 --> 26:58.425
It's Miss Evangelista.

26:58.460 --> 27:00.744
We heard her scream
a few seconds ago.

27:00.779 --> 27:02.820
What could do that to a person
in a few seconds?

27:02.855 --> 27:04.539
It took less than a few seconds.
What did?

27:04.574 --> 27:06.945
"Hello?"

27:06.980 --> 27:08.624
Erm, I'm sorry everyone,

27:08.659 --> 27:12.260
this isn't going to be pleasant.

27:12.295 --> 27:15.539
She's ghosting. She's what?

27:15.574 --> 27:18.745
"Hello, excuse me?"

27:18.780 --> 27:21.580
"I'm sorry, hello, excuse me?"

27:21.615 --> 27:23.704
That's...

27:23.739 --> 27:25.224
That's Miss Evangelista!

27:25.259 --> 27:28.220
I don't want to sound horrible,
but couldn't we...you know?

27:28.255 --> 27:30.819
This is her last moment...
no, we can't.

27:30.854 --> 27:33.296
A little respect, thank you.

27:33.331 --> 27:35.515
"Sorry, where am I? Excuse me?"

27:35.550 --> 27:37.665
But that's Miss Evangelista.

27:37.700 --> 27:42.779
It's a Data Ghost,
she'll be gone in a moment.

27:42.814 --> 27:47.859
Miss Evangelista,
you're fine, just relax.

27:47.894 --> 27:49.825
What's a Data Ghost?

27:49.860 --> 27:52.024
There's a neural relay
in the communicator.

27:52.059 --> 27:56.824
Let's you send thought mails.
That's it there, those green lights.

27:56.859 --> 28:02.300
Sometimes it can hold an impression
of a living consciousness for
a short time after death.

28:02.335 --> 28:04.819
Like an after image.

28:05.180 --> 28:08.344
My grandfather lasted a day.

28:08.379 --> 28:11.699
Kept talking about his shoelaces.

28:13.020 --> 28:14.265
She's in there!

28:14.300 --> 28:18.064
"I can't see, I can't...
Where am I?"

28:18.099 --> 28:20.939
She's just brain waves now.
The pattern won't hold for long.

28:22.579 --> 28:26.139
She's conscious! She's thinking.

28:26.174 --> 28:28.504
"I can't see, I can't..."

28:28.539 --> 28:32.060
"I don't know what I'm thinking."
She's a footprint on the beach.

28:32.095 --> 28:34.177
And the tide's coming in.

28:34.212 --> 28:36.225
"Where's that woman?"

28:36.260 --> 28:39.179
"The nice woman... is she there?"

28:39.214 --> 28:43.077
What woman? She means...

28:43.112 --> 28:46.905
I think she means me.

28:46.940 --> 28:50.460
"Is she there? The nice woman?"

28:50.495 --> 28:53.779
Yeah, she's here, hang on.

28:55.620 --> 28:57.099
Go ahead. She can hear you.

28:57.134 --> 28:58.579
"Hello? Are you there?"

29:00.099 --> 29:01.744
Help her.

29:01.779 --> 29:04.380
She's dead. Yeah. Help her.

29:05.859 --> 29:09.180
"Hello? Is that the nice woman?"

29:09.215 --> 29:11.545
Yeah. Hello.

29:11.580 --> 29:14.619
Yeah, I'm I'm... I'm here. You OK?

29:15.699 --> 29:17.659
"What I said before...

29:17.694 --> 29:19.585
"about being stupid...

29:19.620 --> 29:21.780
"don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh."

29:21.815 --> 29:23.265
Course I won't.

29:23.300 --> 29:24.784
Course I won't tell them.

29:24.819 --> 29:27.379
"Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh..."

29:27.414 --> 29:29.277
I won't tell them.

29:29.312 --> 29:31.105
I said I won't.

29:31.140 --> 29:34.500
"Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh."

29:34.535 --> 29:37.024
I'm not going to tell them.

29:37.059 --> 29:39.159
"Don't tell the others,
they'll only laugh."

29:39.194 --> 29:41.260
She's looping now.
The pattern's degrading.

29:41.295 --> 29:44.619
"I can't think, I...don't know, I...

29:45.620 --> 29:47.260
"I...

29:47.295 --> 29:48.865
"I...

29:48.900 --> 29:50.864
"Ice cream.

29:50.899 --> 29:54.300
"Ice cream. Ice cream.

29:54.335 --> 29:56.545
"Ice cream."

29:56.580 --> 29:58.700
Does anybody mind if I..?

30:09.899 --> 30:14.300
That was horrible. That was the
most horrible thing I've ever seen.

30:16.179 --> 30:18.859
No. It's just a freak of technology.

30:20.459 --> 30:22.579
But whatever did this to her,

30:22.614 --> 30:24.817
whatever killed her...

30:24.852 --> 30:27.020
I'd like a word with that.

30:27.055 --> 30:28.659
I'll introduce you.

30:38.219 --> 30:40.380
I'm going to need a packed lunch.
Hang on.

30:43.580 --> 30:46.099
What's in that book? Spoilers.

30:46.134 --> 30:48.264
Who are you?

30:48.299 --> 30:50.539
Professor River Song, University
of...

30:50.574 --> 30:52.819
To me. Who are you to me? Again...

30:52.854 --> 30:54.984
spoilers.

30:55.019 --> 30:57.339
Chicken, and a bit of salad.

30:57.374 --> 30:59.539
Knock yourself out.

31:02.019 --> 31:04.225
Right, you lot.

31:04.260 --> 31:10.779
Let's meet the Vashta Nerada!

31:11.739 --> 31:16.020
Darling, Dr Moon is going now.
But he'd like a word with you
alone, is that all right?

31:16.055 --> 31:18.340
Yes, of course, Dr Moon. Thank you.

31:22.219 --> 31:25.059
Now, listen.

31:26.940 --> 31:28.825
This is important.

31:28.860 --> 31:34.579
There's the real world, and
there's the world of nightmares.

31:34.614 --> 31:36.180
Isn't there? You understand?

31:36.215 --> 31:38.584
Yes, I know, Dr Moon.

31:38.619 --> 31:41.420
What I want you to
remember is this...

31:41.455 --> 31:43.897
and I know it's hard.

31:43.932 --> 31:46.305
The real world is a lie,

31:46.340 --> 31:49.059
and your nightmares are real.

31:49.094 --> 31:50.905
The Library is real.

31:50.940 --> 31:56.140
There are people trapped in there,
people who need to be saved.

31:56.175 --> 31:58.179
The shadows are moving again.

31:58.214 --> 31:59.984
Those people

32:00.019 --> 32:02.579
are depending on you.

32:02.614 --> 32:05.139
Only you can save them.

32:05.174 --> 32:06.579
Only you.

32:14.380 --> 32:17.120
You travel with him, don't you?

32:17.155 --> 32:19.860
The Doctor, you travel with him.

32:19.895 --> 32:21.145
What of it?

32:21.180 --> 32:23.024
Proper Dave,
could you move over a bit?

32:23.059 --> 32:26.099
Why? Just over there by
the water cooler. Thanks.

32:29.299 --> 32:31.679
You know him, don't you?

32:31.714 --> 32:34.327
Oh, God, do I know that man.

32:34.362 --> 32:36.940
We go way back, that man and me.

32:36.975 --> 32:38.660
Just not this far back.

32:38.695 --> 32:40.185
I'm sorry, what?

32:40.220 --> 32:42.220
He hasn't met me yet.

32:44.140 --> 32:48.699
I sent him a message but it went
wrong, it arrived too early.

32:48.734 --> 32:51.219
This is the Doctor in the days
before he knew me.

32:53.820 --> 32:55.864
And he looks at me,

32:55.899 --> 33:00.620
and he looks right through me. And
it shouldn't kill me, but it does.

33:00.655 --> 33:02.217
What are you talking about?

33:02.252 --> 33:04.055
Are you just talking rubbish?

33:04.090 --> 33:06.414
Do you know him or don't you?

33:06.449 --> 33:09.114
Donna, quiet, I'm working! Sorry!

33:09.149 --> 33:11.780
Donna? You're Donna? Donna Noble?

33:11.815 --> 33:13.700
Yeah, why?

33:15.340 --> 33:17.480
I do know the Doctor.

33:17.515 --> 33:19.767
But in the future.

33:19.802 --> 33:21.985
His personal future.

33:22.020 --> 33:24.000
So why don't you know me?

33:24.035 --> 33:25.980
Where am I in the future?

33:28.260 --> 33:30.224
OK!

33:30.259 --> 33:32.585
We've got a live one.

33:32.620 --> 33:36.860
That's not darkness down those
tunnels, this is not a shadow.

33:36.895 --> 33:38.384
It's a swarm.

33:38.419 --> 33:40.419
A man-eating swarm.

33:43.340 --> 33:47.160
The piranhas of the air,
the Vashta Nerada.

33:47.195 --> 33:50.945
Literally "the shadows
that melt the flesh".

33:50.980 --> 33:54.344
Most planets have them,
but usually in small clusters.

33:54.379 --> 33:57.620
I've never seen an infestation
on this scale, or this aggressive.

33:57.655 --> 33:59.704
What d'you mean, most planets?

33:59.739 --> 34:02.739
Not Earth? Mmmm, Earth,
and a billion other worlds.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.077
Where there's meat,
there's Vashta Nerada.

34:05.112 --> 34:07.380
You can see them sometimes,
if you look.

34:07.415 --> 34:10.824
The dust in sunbeams.

34:10.859 --> 34:13.985
If they were on Earth, we'd know.

34:14.020 --> 34:16.020
Nah,
normally they live on road kill.

34:16.054 --> 34:19.264
But sometimes people go missing.

34:19.300 --> 34:21.980
Not everyone comes
back out of the dark.

34:22.014 --> 34:24.357
Every shadow? No.

34:24.391 --> 34:26.364
But any shadow.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.304
So what do we do?

34:28.339 --> 34:32.420
Daleks - aim for the eyestalk.
Sontarans - back of the neck.

34:32.455 --> 34:34.579
Vashta Nerada...

34:35.059 --> 34:37.623
Run! Just run.

34:37.659 --> 34:41.018
Run where?
This is an index point.
There must be an exit teleport.

34:41.054 --> 34:43.739
Don't look at me, I haven't
memorised the schematics!

34:43.775 --> 34:45.945
Doctor, the little shop!

34:45.980 --> 34:50.300
They always make you go through
the little shop on the way out
so they can sell you stuff.

34:50.335 --> 34:54.417
You're right!
That's why I like the little shop!
OK, let's move it.

34:54.452 --> 34:58.500
Actually, Proper Dave, could you
stay where you are for a moment?
Why?

34:58.535 --> 35:00.625
I'm sorry.

35:00.660 --> 35:04.104
I am so, so sorry.

35:04.139 --> 35:06.780
But you've got two shadows.

35:13.179 --> 35:19.340
It's how they hunt, they latch on
to a food source and keep it fresh.

35:19.375 --> 35:21.904
What do I do?
You stay absolutely still.

35:21.939 --> 35:24.460
Like there's a wasp in the room,
a million wasps.

35:24.495 --> 35:25.545
We're not leaving you, Dave.

35:25.580 --> 35:28.419
Of course not. Where's your helmet?
Don't point, tell me.

35:28.454 --> 35:30.616
On the floor, by my bag.

35:30.651 --> 35:32.779
Don't cross his shadow!

35:40.139 --> 35:42.544
Thanks. Now, the rest of you,

35:42.579 --> 35:45.619
helmets on and sealed up.
We'll need everything we've got.

35:45.654 --> 35:48.624
Doctor, we haven't got any helmets.
We're safe anyway.

35:48.659 --> 35:51.659
How are we safe? We're not, that
was a clever lie to shut you up.

35:51.694 --> 35:53.865
Professor,
anything I can do with the suit?

35:53.900 --> 35:57.500
What good are suits? Miss
Evanglista was wearing one, there
was nothing left.

35:57.535 --> 35:59.739
We can increase
the mesh-density, dial it up 400%.

35:59.774 --> 36:01.460
Make it a tougher meal. OK.

36:03.780 --> 36:06.145
800%! Pass it on. Gotcha!

36:06.180 --> 36:08.340
What's that? It's a screwdriver.

36:08.375 --> 36:10.305
It's sonic.

36:10.340 --> 36:12.900
Yeah, I know. Snap!

36:19.460 --> 36:22.659
With me, come on!

36:25.500 --> 36:27.505
Is it a good time to shop?

36:27.540 --> 36:30.259
No talking! It's a teleport,
stand in the middle.

36:30.294 --> 36:32.979
Can't send the others,
TARDIS won't recognise them.

36:33.014 --> 36:35.145
You don't have a suit,
you're not safe!

36:35.180 --> 36:37.980
You don't have a suit, you're in
just as much danger as me...

36:38.015 --> 36:39.957
Donna! Let me explain.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.899
Oh, that's how you do it!

36:41.934 --> 36:43.059
Doctor!

36:55.539 --> 36:56.999
Where did it go?

36:57.034 --> 36:58.425
It's just gone.

36:58.460 --> 37:00.520
I looked round, one shadow. See.

37:00.555 --> 37:02.545
Does that mean we can leave?

37:02.580 --> 37:05.660
I don't know why we're still here.
We can leave him, can't we?

37:05.695 --> 37:08.665
I mean, no offence. Shut up, Mr Lux.

37:08.700 --> 37:11.179
Did you feel anything?
Like an energy transfer?

37:11.214 --> 37:14.300
No, no, but, look, it's gone.

37:14.335 --> 37:15.944
Stop there, stop moving.

37:15.979 --> 37:18.420
They're never just gone.
And they never give up.

37:21.259 --> 37:24.145
Well, this one's benign.

37:24.180 --> 37:27.064
Hey, who turned out the lights?

37:27.099 --> 37:31.140
No-one, they're fine.
No, seriously, turn them back on!
They are on.

37:31.175 --> 37:33.459
I can't see a ruddy thing.

37:33.494 --> 37:35.504
Dave, turn round.

37:35.539 --> 37:38.399
What's going on? Why can't I see?

37:38.434 --> 37:41.225
Is the power gone, are we safe here?

37:41.260 --> 37:44.985
Dave, I want you stay still,
absolutely still.

37:45.020 --> 37:48.540
Dave, Dave? Dave, can you hear me,
are you all right? Talk to me, Dave.

37:50.739 --> 37:52.825
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm...fine.

37:52.860 --> 37:55.460
I want you to stay still,
absolutely still.

37:55.495 --> 37:59.100
I'm fine, I'm OK, I'm...fine.

38:00.339 --> 38:02.499
I can't...

38:02.780 --> 38:04.819
Why can't I? I...

38:04.854 --> 38:07.264
I can't...

38:07.299 --> 38:08.780
Why can't I? I...

38:09.780 --> 38:11.600
I can't...

38:11.635 --> 38:13.420
Why can't I?

38:13.455 --> 38:15.785
I...

38:15.820 --> 38:17.625
He's gone. He's ghosting.

38:17.660 --> 38:20.079
Then why is he still standing?

38:20.114 --> 38:22.499
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

38:23.300 --> 38:25.299
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

38:25.334 --> 38:26.625
Doctor, don't!

38:26.660 --> 38:28.065
Dave, can you hear me?

38:28.100 --> 38:29.899
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

38:34.020 --> 38:35.619
Who turned out the lights?

38:36.260 --> 38:39.939
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
S'cuse me!

38:39.974 --> 38:43.140
Back from it, get back,
right back!

38:47.420 --> 38:49.059
Doesn't move very fast does it?

38:49.094 --> 38:51.460
It's a swarm in a suit.

38:51.495 --> 38:52.980
But it's learning.

38:58.099 --> 39:01.260
What do we do? Where do we go?
See that wall behind you?

39:01.295 --> 39:02.940
DUCK!

39:04.299 --> 39:06.424
Squareness gun!

39:06.459 --> 39:09.459
Everybody out. Go, go, go!

39:09.494 --> 39:11.297
Move it, move, move!

39:11.332 --> 39:13.065
Move it, move, move!

39:13.100 --> 39:16.300
You said not every shadow.
But any shadow!

39:19.300 --> 39:21.139
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

39:21.174 --> 39:22.700
Run!

39:36.059 --> 39:38.759
Sweetie, dinner's ready.

39:38.794 --> 39:41.460
Donna Noble has been saved.

39:42.819 --> 39:44.420
Sweetie?

40:06.700 --> 40:09.465
Trying to boost the power.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.219
Light doesn't stop them,
but it slows them down.

40:12.254 --> 40:15.300
So what's the plan?
Do we have a plan?

40:15.335 --> 40:16.659
Your screwdriver...

40:19.979 --> 40:21.900
Looks exactly like mine. Yeah.

40:21.935 --> 40:23.545
You gave it to me.

40:23.580 --> 40:26.739
I don't give my screwdriver to
anyone. I'm not anyone.

40:26.774 --> 40:28.436
Who are you?

40:28.471 --> 40:30.064
What's the plan?

40:30.099 --> 40:33.225
I teleported Donna
back to the TARDIS.

40:33.260 --> 40:37.100
If we don't get back in five hours,
emergency program one activates.
Take her home.

40:37.135 --> 40:39.504
We need to get a shift on.
She's not there.

40:39.539 --> 40:44.300
I should've received a signal,
the console signals me if
there's a teleport breach.

40:44.335 --> 40:47.819
Maybe the co-ordinates slipped.
The equipment here's ancient.

40:47.854 --> 40:49.584
Donna Noble.

40:49.619 --> 40:53.340
There's a Donna Noble in this
library, do you have the software
to locate her?

40:53.375 --> 40:55.780
Donna Noble has left the Library.

40:55.815 --> 40:58.660
Donna Noble has been saved.

40:58.695 --> 41:00.304
Donna!

41:00.339 --> 41:03.064
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:03.099 --> 41:05.900
Donna Noble has been saved.
How can it be Donna?

41:05.935 --> 41:07.785
How's that possible?

41:07.820 --> 41:10.584
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:10.619 --> 41:14.379
Donnna Noble has been saved.
Oh, Donna!

41:14.414 --> 41:18.140
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Doctor!

41:18.175 --> 41:20.545
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

41:20.580 --> 41:25.820
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.

41:25.855 --> 41:27.777
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

41:27.812 --> 41:29.700
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:29.735 --> 41:31.617
Donna Noble has been saved.

41:31.652 --> 41:33.755
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

41:33.790 --> 41:35.859
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:35.894 --> 41:38.584
Donna Noble has been saved.

41:38.619 --> 41:41.419
Hey! Who turned out the lights?
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:41.700 --> 41:44.780
Donna Noble has been saved.
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

41:44.815 --> 41:46.677
Donna Noble has left the Library.

41:46.712 --> 41:48.405
Doctor, what are we going to do?

41:48.440 --> 41:50.064
Hey! Who turned out the lights?

41:50.099 --> 41:55.460
Donna Noble has left the Library.
Donna Noble has been saved.
