see what I can find.

15:53.996 --> 15:55.563
JOE: I'm going to stop by
the Sheriff's Office

15:55.693 --> 15:58.609
and see if they ever
looked into Terry's
death threats.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.482
Joe, you didn't tell me
the governor shut down
hunting season.

16:01.612 --> 16:03.658
Who's saying that?The news.

16:04.528 --> 16:07.575
Did you not know?No.

16:07.705 --> 16:11.405
I mean, there was talk,
but a heads up
would have been good.

16:11.535 --> 16:12.928
There's gonna be blowback.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.497
It might come our way.

16:16.627 --> 16:18.542
The hunters are gonna
blame me for this.

16:19.891 --> 16:21.284
Well, we'll be all right.

16:21.415 --> 16:23.678
You stay safe, okay?

16:23.808 --> 16:26.768
Yeah, I will.
I love you.

16:26.898 --> 16:28.117
Love you, too.

16:48.311 --> 16:51.836
They're offering us
$40,000 a head
for the Andalusians

16:51.967 --> 16:54.535
and $100,000
for the Oldenburgs.

16:54.665 --> 16:58.017
Cover the import tax,
take care of customs.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.844
We're not selling
our prized horses

16:59.975 --> 17:01.672
to a bunch
of Maple-suckers.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.067
We don't have
very many
options left, Mom.

17:05.198 --> 17:07.113
We'll hold on
for a better offer.

17:07.242 --> 17:09.028
They're just
taking advantage
of our weakened state.

17:10.203 --> 17:12.422
It's only getting
weaker, Mom.

17:12.553 --> 17:14.858
I spent weeks in Alberta
putting this together.

17:14.990 --> 17:16.470
We're not gonna get
a better deal.

17:17.339 --> 17:20.039
Okay.
Now, hear me out.

17:20.169 --> 17:22.214
What if
we keep the horses,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.217
and we sell their semen
on the black market?

17:25.782 --> 17:26.741
I know a guy.

17:28.656 --> 17:31.615
We are hanging on
by a goddamn thread here.

17:31.746 --> 17:34.053
Hunting season
has been shut down.

17:34.183 --> 17:36.490
The outfitting business
is our best source
of revenue,

17:36.620 --> 17:37.882
and it's gone!

17:39.362 --> 17:40.624
If we don't make
money somehow,

17:40.755 --> 17:42.670
we're gonna
lose everything.

17:44.585 --> 17:46.717
You're right.

17:46.848 --> 17:49.851
We're just going to have
to open hunting season
back, then.

17:51.635 --> 17:53.159
Yeah. You got a plan?

17:53.289 --> 17:55.291
I'll call the governor.ARLEN: I already did.

returning my calls.

It's bad, Mom.
The whole country's
going to hell.

18:01.384 --> 18:03.517
It's unconstitutional,
is what it is.

18:03.647 --> 18:04.822
They're oppressing us.

18:05.606 --> 18:06.737
We got to fight!

18:08.783 --> 18:12.003
That's exactly
what we'll do.

18:12.134 --> 18:17.226
We're going to rally
every hunter in the state
to come together

18:18.488 --> 18:22.449
and claw back
our God-given right
to hunt

18:22.579 --> 18:24.451
by any means necessary.

that we were having lunch
so I could...

So I could
surprise you.

for you, my dear.

I bought us a ranch.

19:08.886 --> 19:10.888
Yeah. Yeah.

19:11.019 --> 19:12.455
Now you can move
out of the motel,

19:12.586 --> 19:14.849
and we can
live together
like a real couple.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.112

to break it to my mom,

19:17.243 --> 19:19.723

happy for me.

been handcuffed,

he could have
defended himself.

Hunting season
has been shut down.

24:02.397 --> 24:05.835
Hunting is half the reason
why people live in Wyoming.

And there's rumblings
of armed protests

24:10.100 --> 24:12.189
being organized
in Saddlestring.

24:13.408 --> 24:15.497
There's gonna be

can't solve this case.

24:56.843 --> 24:58.279
Yeah, if it's quick.

24:58.409 --> 24:59.367

figure out a way

24:59.498 --> 25:00.977
to keep Saddlestring
from burning.

to feel

25:14.687 --> 25:17.211
