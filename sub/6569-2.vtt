on the night of our eighth month-iversary?</i>

Please don't tell me you're doing that face.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.003
DANA: I am doing that face.

Hey, Gary, honeymoons rule.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.368
The <i>Dirty Dozen</i> is on and we're eating chips

00:33.467 --> 00:35.413
from bowls perched on each other's bellies.

00:35.836 --> 00:37.179
Sounds great, Mike.

00:37.237 --> 00:39.478
We put a penny in ajar
every time we have sex.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.143
We've already got like 15 in there.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.154
Did you call me
to talk dirty about your honeymoon?

00:43.210 --> 00:45.315
- DANA: I can talk dirty.
- That's okay.

00:45.379 --> 00:48.690
Wendy got the heads up,
POTUS's body man is quitting.

00:48.815 --> 00:50.817
- Marty? What, did he get sick or something?
- Mmm-mmm.

00:51.151 --> 00:52.994
Law school. You gonna go for it?

00:53.053 --> 00:55.363
I don't wanna be a guy
in his 40s carrying a bag.

00:55.989 --> 00:58.435
I've got ideas. I could advise Selina on stuff.

00:58.525 --> 01:00.163
I've got plenty of things that I could tell her.

01:00.227 --> 01:03.174
Hey, gotta go.
Telly Savalas is gonna kill some Nazis.

What are these? These are the stables?

01:17.844 --> 01:19.846
Well, it's gonna get spruced up.

Hello, hello, this is it, this is it. (LAUGHS)

01:23.116 --> 01:24.424
It is. How are you?

01:24.518 --> 01:26.555
- Hi.
- I'm afraid I don't know who you are.

01:26.687 --> 01:28.098
- I'm Kelly.
- SELINA: Hi, Kelly.

01:28.188 --> 01:29.895
- I'm working on your campaign.
- Great.

01:29.957 --> 01:31.027
And I'll be taking photographs today.

AMY: Amy Brookheimer.
You've been in touch with my...

01:33.093 --> 01:35.869
The men's toilet is busted, so...

01:36.029 --> 01:37.406
Here we are. (CHUCKLES)

01:37.598 --> 01:40.135
Wow, here you are. See, now, I thought

01:40.233 --> 01:42.941
that I had left you 750 miles ago.

01:43.036 --> 01:44.947
Ma'am, I'm going to follow you
wherever you go.

01:45.038 --> 01:47.211
I'm going to be like a Disney animal.

01:47.541 --> 01:50.078
Uh, is there a space set aside
for the campaign manager?

01:50.210 --> 01:51.211
Uh, not yet.

01:51.612 --> 01:53.091
Could I have two seconds of your time?

01:53.146 --> 01:54.454
Sure thing.

01:54.781 --> 01:56.283
I don't know why Richard is here.

You said he was really good on the book tour.

01:59.553 --> 02:02.932
No, I was trying to keep you
from worrying about me.

Oh...

02:05.826 --> 02:06.896
You're welcome.

02:06.960 --> 02:08.769
- I'll ditch him.
- Yeah, right.

SELINA: Are you going
on the coast guard boat?

02:10.797 --> 02:12.572
Well, I learned to swim especially.

02:13.233 --> 02:14.735
No, I meant...

02:15.736 --> 02:17.079
Oh, my God.
What is your name? I'm so sorry.

02:17.137 --> 02:18.810
- It starts with a K.
- No, could you just tell me?

02:18.905 --> 02:20.350
- It's Kelly.
- Kelly, right.

02:20.574 --> 02:22.485
So, you're coming on the boat,
that's why you have the camera.

02:22.576 --> 02:24.613
So, then, Richard,
you're gonna need to stay here.

02:24.678 --> 02:26.316
RICHARD: Okay, well, you're in good hands.

02:26.413 --> 02:29.189
Kelly and I go way back.
She's like another me.

02:29.282 --> 02:30.989
This doesn't work. Good.

02:31.084 --> 02:32.358
This is a night patrol with the coast guard,

02:32.452 --> 02:34.625
so it's great pre-campaign campaigning.

02:34.755 --> 02:37.361
- I need a wipe.
- No, no. Hey.

02:38.592 --> 02:40.333
Hey, ma'am. I've actually got a few ideas...

02:40.427 --> 02:42.668
You know, ma'am, I was thinking...

02:42.763 --> 02:44.504
- I might skip the boat.
- What?

02:44.598 --> 02:47.101
Yeah, and just hang back here,
do a little pre-prep.

02:47.167 --> 02:49.807
Why would that be, Dan?
Is that a pre-stabbing in my pre-back?

02:49.936 --> 02:51.472
I think I'm gonna need you

02:51.605 --> 02:54.814
just in case we make a drug bust
or something and I need some sort of

02:55.942 --> 02:57.387
- snappy one-liners.
- Uh...

02:58.278 --> 03:01.851
"The only laundering you're gonna be doing
from now on is gonna be prison blankets."

03:01.982 --> 03:03.359
That's kind of clever.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.659
"The only crack you're going to see
belongs to some guy in a shower."

03:06.787 --> 03:08.460
- Don't be cute.
- Oh, my God.

03:08.622 --> 03:11.466
So, here, it begins here,

"In this Polish dungeon."

(ALL LAUGHING)

03:14.461 --> 03:16.737
Hey, ma'am, about the campaign,
I had an idea.

03:16.830 --> 03:20.334
- Here you go.
- Instead of doing all this pre-campaigning,

03:20.400 --> 03:22.346
sometime in the next 24 hours,
you grab a mic,

03:22.502 --> 03:25.381
you say, "I'm Selina Meyer and I'm running
for President of the United States."

03:25.472 --> 03:26.712
I'm just gonna use the bathroom really quick.

03:26.807 --> 03:29.048
It's way too early.
You don't announce your candidacy

03:29.142 --> 03:30.644
while the incumbent is still warm.

03:30.711 --> 03:32.054
- (DOOR SLAMS)
- AMY: The basic thing...

03:32.145 --> 03:33.988
That's like trying
to bang the widow at the funeral.

03:34.081 --> 03:35.685
There's a little trick to it.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.525
- The trick would be to move it.
- You're right, and I sure will.

03:38.585 --> 03:40.223
You would have her start her campaign

03:40.320 --> 03:42.823
with no strategy, no money, no staff,

03:42.889 --> 03:44.698
except for Superman
and Wonder Woman over there,

03:44.758 --> 03:46.260
just, "I wanna be president."

03:46.393 --> 03:47.929
Ma'am, I don't know
if you heard what he was saying...

03:48.028 --> 03:50.565
No, I didn't hear what he was saying.
But I agree with Dan, okay?

03:50.664 --> 03:53.907
And I completely appreciate your ideas, Gary.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.604
DAN: No matter how dumb they are.
AMY: So, let's go.

03:55.702 --> 03:57.181
The coasts won't guard themselves.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.183
Let me tell you what we need to do.

04:01.508 --> 04:04.455
They intercepted an individual
untracked vessel, suspicious cargo.

04:04.544 --> 04:05.750
They're requesting backup.

04:05.846 --> 04:07.917
- Oh, is it a drug boat?
- We're looking into it, ma'am.

04:08.014 --> 04:09.084
AMY: That's a stroke of luck.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.388
SELINA: I'm gonna do
a short, little video thing.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.087
- Okay.
- The drugs stop here.

04:12.185 --> 04:13.459
GARY: Oh!

04:13.553 --> 04:15.430
No, no, don't say anything right after,
'cause it ruins it.

04:15.522 --> 04:17.559
- Got it.
- The drugs stop here.

04:17.624 --> 04:19.125
- We need to go, ma'am.
- Yes, yes.

04:19.226 --> 04:21.433
- Just one second.
- "They stop here," firm.

04:21.528 --> 04:23.633
- The drugs stop here.
- GARY: Nice.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.802
- Thank you.
- One thing, this definitely does not do video.

04:26.900 --> 04:28.902
- SELINA: I'm sorry?
- Then what were you doing?

04:29.603 --> 04:30.911
Perfect.

04:31.037 --> 04:32.710
Use your common sense next time.

04:33.774 --> 04:35.276
You just gonna sit there, SpongeBob?

04:35.609 --> 04:37.054
Just got to take a seat for a second, okay?

04:37.110 --> 04:39.215
- We haven't even shoved off.
- I know, I know.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.485
I'm not great on boats, okay?

04:40.580 --> 04:42.423
Are you getting pre-sick?

04:42.783 --> 04:44.057
- Get downstairs.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.961

- Come on, Egan, God damn it.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.326
Oh!

04:52.259 --> 04:54.261
Mikey, honey,

04:54.327 --> 04:56.830
look who I found in a basket at our front door.

04:56.930 --> 04:58.841
- Jonah, what are you doing here?
- JONAH: What's up, Mike?

04:58.932 --> 05:00.411
You gonna introduce me?

05:00.767 --> 05:03.111
Yeah. Walt, Randall, this is Sasquatch.

05:03.170 --> 05:05.172
The edible garbage is out back in the alley.

05:05.272 --> 05:07.650
What's up, y'all punk-ass bitches?
I'm Jonah Ryan.

05:07.741 --> 05:10.415
Wow. "Bitches."
All right, we're gonna have dinner soon.

05:10.477 --> 05:12.923
And then I taped The Great Escape for later.

05:13.013 --> 05:15.619
- Oh. 17?
- 17.

05:15.849 --> 05:17.419
So wrap it up soon.

05:18.318 --> 05:20.662
So, you're probably bumming you can't be

05:20.754 --> 05:23.257
out on that boat in Baltimore Harbor
with the Veep, huh?

05:23.356 --> 05:24.801
- Honeymoon.
- Yeah.

05:25.258 --> 05:28.000
Is she going to her campaign headquarters
in Maryland after?

05:28.094 --> 05:30.700
Yeah, but it's not a campaign office.

05:30.797 --> 05:32.276
It's a real estate acquisition.

05:32.666 --> 05:34.043
Oh, yeah. Of course, right.

05:34.267 --> 05:36.440
- Keep it quiet.
- A PAC-quisition, huh?

05:36.837 --> 05:39.215
Big man, up top. For the win.

05:39.673 --> 05:41.482
Hey, Mike, serious talk.

05:41.541 --> 05:44.021
The reason I'm here
is because I'm opening up a consulting firm

05:44.110 --> 05:45.145
and I want you on board.

05:45.212 --> 05:48.284
Consulting on what?
How to delete your Internet search history?

05:48.381 --> 05:50.861
So, Jonah, heard you got canned.

05:50.951 --> 05:53.363
Yeah. But you know what? It was for the best.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.966
I was telling Mike about it.
It's gonna be called Ryantology.

05:56.289 --> 05:59.202
DC insider turns DC outlaw,

05:59.326 --> 06:01.033
energizing democracy,

06:01.127 --> 06:03.573
taking from the powerful
and giving to the pitiful.

06:03.663 --> 06:05.700
- Know what I'm saying?
- Why are you at our house, then?

06:05.799 --> 06:07.039
Maybe he needs a start-up.

06:07.133 --> 06:09.135
Remember that random dude
who used to hang out on our street

06:09.202 --> 06:10.476
asking Mom for money?

06:10.537 --> 06:12.380
- That was Mike.

<i>- Grazie.</i>
- Mmm-hmm.

06:20.313 --> 06:22.315
You've got her well trained already, Mike.

06:22.382 --> 06:23.986
MIKE: Your business model sucks. I'm out.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.530
Hey, Wendy, if you're grabbing beers,
would you mind grabbing...

06:26.686 --> 06:27.994
Okay, that's fine.

of me with him surrendering.

06:36.863 --> 06:38.069
Is that wrong to do that?

06:38.231 --> 06:41.371
No, it's just a shame they couldn't arrest
someone a little more photogenic.

06:41.434 --> 06:43.744
We can just pixelate him, the face.

06:43.837 --> 06:46.249
- That's fine.
- I have no idea how to do that.

06:46.339 --> 06:48.341
Hey, I voted for you!

06:48.441 --> 06:50.250

06:50.343 --> 06:52.584
but I'm afraid you have to go to prison!

06:52.712 --> 06:56.125
Ma'am, we need to get back.
POTUS has made a statement.

06:56.516 --> 06:57.586
What? What now?

06:57.684 --> 06:59.061
OFFICER: Sir, can you explain this?

06:59.185 --> 07:01.028
SELINA: Gary.
GARY: You gotta get a shot of this.

07:01.087 --> 07:02.532
- Ma'am...
- GARY: Swords. He's got swords.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.570
Fuck the swords.
POTUS just announced that he's now pro-life.

07:06.526 --> 07:09.302
- What?
- Our POTUS? The POTUS?

Institute of Medical Ethics,
after-dinner speech, 20-week cutoff!

07:13.934 --> 07:17.245
He's pro-choice!
Now all of a sudden, he's pro-life?

07:17.304 --> 07:19.215
They're already calling him PRO-TUS,

07:19.372 --> 07:22.080
which is stupid because
both sides have pro at the start.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.448
- SELINA: Gary!
- Yeah.

07:23.543 --> 07:25.887
- SELINA: Go get Dan!
- He's downstairs.

07:25.979 --> 07:28.289
Below deck, Amy. You gotta say below deck.

07:28.381 --> 07:30.759

07:30.817 --> 07:33.457
"a little freedom to those
who cannot choose."

07:33.553 --> 07:36.500
Okay, Amy, I do not mean to sound paranoid,

07:36.623 --> 07:38.569
but he is trying to kill me.

SELINA: Right, exactly.

07:40.961 --> 07:42.497

what I'm gonna say.

07:42.595 --> 07:43.630
Yeah, I just gotta... (BELCHES)

07:43.730 --> 07:46.904
We are pro-choice,
but we're not controversial, right?

07:46.967 --> 07:50.813
Yeah, they got first trimester,
second trimester, third trimester...

07:50.904 --> 07:54.078
You're listing trimesters. Stop it!

and figure out what we're gonna say.

Hi, Sue. Is the vice president around?

08:05.185 --> 08:07.665
She is not, sir. She's on a coast guard boat

meeting and greeting fish.

08:09.522 --> 08:11.661
Ah, the salty sea.

08:14.461 --> 08:17.772
Sue, forgive me,
but have you altered your hair, perhaps?

08:17.864 --> 08:20.811
I got it chemically relaxed.
It <i>was</i> enormously painful.

08:20.967 --> 08:22.207
Well, it seems to be working for you.

08:22.435 --> 08:23.607
Thank you.

08:25.438 --> 08:27.850
Damn it. The president's gone rogue.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.351
BEN: <i>Ma'am, I swear to God,</i>

08:34.447 --> 08:36.188
we all thought he was
gonna just eat some shrimp,

08:36.282 --> 08:38.193
rattle off a few platitudes, go home,

08:38.284 --> 08:41.663
watch Full Meta! Jacket
for the millionth time and fall asleep.

08:41.721 --> 08:44.861
Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife
and get on the speakerphone, now.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.028
Do you know what this is?

08:46.126 --> 08:47.230
Let me explain something to you.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.672
This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay?

08:50.730 --> 08:53.836
This is the unflushable turd

08:53.900 --> 08:58.076
that is left in the can for the next person,
e.g. me.

08:58.171 --> 08:59.878
The toilet's still broken, FYI.

08:59.973 --> 09:01.418
Has POTUS gone nuts?

09:01.508 --> 09:03.215
We can't have a crazy president.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.548
- In Italy they do.
- (SELINA EXHALES)

09:04.644 --> 09:06.555
We have to get
all of the special interest groups in.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.148
Right, we have to bring them all in,

09:08.214 --> 09:11.491
and I'll listen the shit out of
every one of those morons.

09:12.218 --> 09:14.562
BEN: <i>This issue is toxic.
So keep the groups apart.</i>

09:14.654 --> 09:16.725
<i>Pro-choice in the morning,
pro-life in the afternoon</i>

09:16.856 --> 09:18.358
so nobody shoots any doctors.

09:18.558 --> 09:21.164
Ma'am, listen,
you're going to end up pissing somebody off.

09:21.227 --> 09:22.865
It's better to just take a stand now.

09:22.929 --> 09:24.067
Putting through Mike.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.542
MIKE ON SPEAKER: <i>Hi, guys.
How was that coast guard boat, huh?</i>

09:26.666 --> 09:29.078
- That's my bad.
- Just put it through on this one.

09:29.169 --> 09:30.705
Incompatibility issues.

09:30.837 --> 09:32.373
Just bring it over here, please.

09:32.439 --> 09:33.884
- Hang on, Mike.
- MIKE: Hello?

09:34.007 --> 09:35.918
- It doesn't reach.
- SELINA: Would you please move?

09:36.009 --> 09:37.181
- KELLY: Yes.
- You hold this here.

09:37.243 --> 09:39.723
<i>Were you on an RB-M or an RB-S II?</i>

09:39.779 --> 09:41.520
We really can't talk about the boat right now,

09:41.581 --> 09:45.427
because, Mike, we're trying to figure out
how I think about this issue.

09:45.518 --> 09:46.519
<i>Okay-</i>

09:46.586 --> 09:48.862
<i>The Post wants to know
if you've changed your stance on abortion...</i>

09:48.922 --> 09:50.128
- Re POTUS.
- Yeah.

09:50.223 --> 09:52.260
<i>So you could say, "As a woman I believe..."</i>

09:52.358 --> 09:54.531
No, no, no! No, no, no!

09:54.594 --> 09:56.596
I can't identify myself as a woman.

09:56.696 --> 09:59.267
People can't know that. Men hate that.

09:59.532 --> 10:01.239
And women who hate women hate that,

10:01.301 --> 10:03.542
which, I believe, is most women,
don't you agree with that?

10:03.603 --> 10:06.607
Yes, and, ma'am,
we should bag this up and take it back to DC.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.049
- Good idea.
- Yeah. Right.

10:08.108 --> 10:10.645
<i>Oh. Uh, Jonah knows
we opened a campaign office.</i>

10:10.743 --> 10:12.745
<i>He came by my house, Wendy's house.</i>

10:12.812 --> 10:14.792
You let that unstable

10:14.881 --> 10:17.122
piece of human scaffolding into your house?

10:17.217 --> 10:18.252
BEN: <i>And you didn't shoot him?</i>

10:18.318 --> 10:19.956
MIKE: <i>Oh, hey, Ben,
I didn't know you were on the phone.</i>

10:20.053 --> 10:21.964
I swear to God,
I felt better on the fucking boat.

10:22.088 --> 10:25.228
Ma'am, didn't you write
something about abortion in your book?

10:25.291 --> 10:26.292
Oh!

10:26.392 --> 10:28.065
- Good point. Good point.
- Yeah. Good, Gary.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.233
SELINA: Good. Where's the book?
Does anybody have a copy of the book here?

10:30.296 --> 10:31.798
- Guys, who has a copy?
- What did she write?

10:31.898 --> 10:34.003
You know what?
I have a bunch of unsold ones in my car.

10:34.234 --> 10:36.077
MIKE: <i>Honey, is Selina's book
in the bathroom?</i>

10:36.169 --> 10:38.979
Okay, here we go.
Abbey Road, abolition, Aboriginal mask...

10:39.072 --> 10:40.779
- MIKE: <i>Page 135.</i>
- This is it.

10:41.474 --> 10:44.455
"Freedom is what this nation is built on"
blah, blah, blah...

10:44.511 --> 10:46.320
"And freedom means the freedom to choose

10:46.412 --> 10:49.757
"how to use that freedom
to protect the freedom of others."

10:49.849 --> 10:52.489
Sorry, that's just pastel-colored shit.

10:52.752 --> 10:54.197
It's gotta be more clear than that.

10:54.654 --> 10:56.998
(CHUCKLES) You make it very clear
you're pro-choice.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.092
MIKE: <i>Okay, I got it,
"Freedom is what this nation... "</i>

10:59.159 --> 11:01.537
Done it, Mike.
It's gonna come down to the cutoff week.

11:01.628 --> 11:03.767
- It always does.
- DAN: There's two doors, okay?

11:03.863 --> 11:05.467
- Pro-choice' pro-life.
- Yeah.

11:05.532 --> 11:07.478
There's no point
in rattling the handles on either one of them.

11:07.534 --> 11:09.343
You just gotta pick a door
and walk through it.

11:09.435 --> 11:11.039
Ma'am, Kent Davison called.

11:11.137 --> 11:14.118
There was an issue with the patch-through,
it doesn't matter.

11:14.607 --> 11:17.952
Message, "Urgent, have booked you
to appear on <i>GMA</i> at 7:00."

11:18.011 --> 11:19.490
I'm sorry, what did you just say?

11:19.779 --> 11:21.122
Give me this, God damn it.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.458
- He said 7:00 a.m.?
- It's <i>Good Morning America,</i> Amy.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.724
- The clue is in the title.
- Ame, can we...

11:27.387 --> 11:31.301
- We can't unbook you.
- No, no. That would look bad.

11:31.457 --> 11:33.801
- BEN: Jesus. Fucking Kent.
- (BEEPS)

11:33.960 --> 11:37.669
I can't listen to that Joan Crawford
bitch about Bette Davis any longer.

11:37.730 --> 11:39.141
Well, this is POTUS, you know?

11:39.199 --> 11:41.475
This is the president
trying to tell me what to do.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.571
He can't do that.
I'm the Vice President of the United States.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.707
DAN: That's right. That's right.
And as vice president,

11:45.805 --> 11:47.512
here's your choice, two doors,

11:47.574 --> 11:49.815
pro-choice, pro-life. That's it.

11:50.143 --> 11:51.554
Is there a third door?

11:51.644 --> 11:54.318
- What, like a woman's door?
- A back door? No.

11:54.881 --> 11:56.519
A trapdoor?

11:58.384 --> 11:59.522
<i>This is Jonah Ryan</i>

11:59.586 --> 12:02.692
<i>and you are witnessing
the birth of Ryantology.</i>

12:02.822 --> 12:05.234
Old media like <i>The Washington Toast,</i>

12:05.325 --> 12:09.102
better go run and hide in the bathroom
and join <i>The Poo York Times.</i>

12:09.195 --> 12:10.833
Because we are cutting in.

12:10.897 --> 12:13.901
I'm going to be updating
more than I'm actually dating,

12:14.167 --> 12:15.840
which is a shitload.

12:16.502 --> 12:18.413
First up, abortion.

12:18.504 --> 12:21.542
And now that the president's given
his State of the Uterus address,

12:21.608 --> 12:23.554
where will the others fall in?

12:23.676 --> 12:25.553
<i>We have Maddox. He's conservative.</i>

12:25.678 --> 12:26.782
<i>Chung, he's liberal.</i>

12:26.879 --> 12:29.359
<i>But where does Selina Meyer stand?</i>

12:29.616 --> 12:31.926
The first call could rule them all.

12:32.218 --> 12:34.391
- So how do I turn this off?
- You just hit the red button.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.398
- There are two. There's one on the side.
- Just the one in the middle.

12:39.025 --> 12:42.097
Why do I gotta deal with this pile of ass
in the middle of the night?

12:42.195 --> 12:44.573
Because we need to get
first dibs on a statement.

12:44.631 --> 12:46.440
Well, you know what I think. I'm a Christian.

12:46.532 --> 12:49.877
- I'm not going to deny that.
- Please, do not go religious.

12:49.936 --> 12:52.212
- Go ambiguous.
- By saying what?

12:52.305 --> 12:55.377
"Blah, blah, blah, blah abortion,
blah, blah, blah, blah"?

12:55.475 --> 12:57.580
- Sounds good to me.
- Well, you fill in the blahs.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.817
- I'm going back to bed.
- (SIGHS)

13:00.146 --> 13:04.788
Okay, ma'am, you have the AMA/ACOG,
West Wing, 1:30 a.m.

13:04.917 --> 13:08.797
Planned Parenthood at 2:30 a.m.
in the EEOB to avoid a clash.

13:08.888 --> 13:10.424
Unflabby precision. Excellent.

13:10.556 --> 13:15.733
Okay, how about this,
"A woman has autonomy over her own body.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.238
"But the rights of an unborn..."

13:18.598 --> 13:21.078
Uh, I thought I had it there.

13:21.434 --> 13:22.777
Maybe I should just say,

13:22.835 --> 13:26.749
"Get the government
out of my fuckin' snatch,“ you know?

13:27.173 --> 13:29.016
How many pressure groups
do we have in all, Sue?

13:29.108 --> 13:30.587
Pro-life, 45.

13:30.643 --> 13:32.122
Pro-choice, about the same.

13:32.178 --> 13:33.987
Is there a "pro-I don't give a shit" lobby?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.252
Yeah. You're looking at him.

13:35.315 --> 13:37.261
- I got posters, buttons...
- (SCOFFS)

13:37.450 --> 13:39.691
Not really, 'cause I don't give a shit.

13:39.786 --> 13:42.494
If men got pregnant,
you could get an abortion at an ATM.

13:42.588 --> 13:44.158
Let's state the obvious.

13:44.590 --> 13:46.831
If I say that I am pro-life,

13:46.926 --> 13:48.269
then I'm a traitor to my sex.

13:48.328 --> 13:49.932
If I say that I'm pro-choice,

13:49.996 --> 13:51.703
then I'm a traitor to the president.

13:51.798 --> 13:53.505
Which makes me an actual traitor, by the way.

13:53.599 --> 13:55.601
- You know that?
- Yeah, but it already happened, okay?

13:55.668 --> 13:58.308
I can't get POTUS to wave
his transvaginal wand

13:58.371 --> 13:59.372
and make it all go away.

13:59.472 --> 14:02.146
Ma'am, your gender is worth
at least double on this issue.

14:02.208 --> 14:04.484
The data's right.
As a woman, you can really kick ass.

14:04.711 --> 14:06.452
As a woman... (CHUCKLES)

14:06.512 --> 14:09.959
I am not gonna put in a fuckin' sentence
"as a woman."

14:10.016 --> 14:11.859
I'm not putting my eggs in that basket.

14:11.951 --> 14:14.955
All right, I'll start polling. Nice dress.

14:15.788 --> 14:17.358
- It's a skirt and top.
- Even better.

14:17.457 --> 14:20.802
Okay, so are we gonna say screw polling
and just pick a number

14:20.860 --> 14:22.965
or both, or what?

14:23.029 --> 14:25.339
God, it's not that simple, Dan.

14:25.398 --> 14:27.173
DAN: Yes, Gary, it is.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.802
- Have you seen the graph?
- Yeah.

14:28.868 --> 14:31.508
How could we get it all on the graph, Gary,
if it wasn't that simple?

14:31.571 --> 14:33.676
It isn't that simple, all right?

14:33.806 --> 14:37.413
This is about access to safe abortions

14:37.510 --> 14:38.853
for vulnerable women.

14:38.911 --> 14:41.152
- It is a serious issue.
- Yeah.

14:41.214 --> 14:43.820
- Ma'am, I've laid out a line of fruit for you.
- What is this?

14:43.983 --> 14:47.692
It's the size of the baby
in different stages during pregnancy.

14:47.854 --> 14:50.733
It would take a brain about this size

14:50.857 --> 14:52.495
to think that this shit's useful.

14:52.558 --> 14:53.730
This is not helpful at all.

14:53.826 --> 14:56.033
And you need to stop
calling these things babies.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.405
Okay, I was thinking
we need to get the number of weeks

14:58.498 --> 15:00.171
and the interest groups up on a...

15:00.400 --> 15:02.107
Oh, good. Nice job.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.881
Holy shit.
Maddox is about to issue a statement in five.

15:06.005 --> 15:08.349
At 1:00 in the morning?
Whats his statement gonna be?

15:08.408 --> 15:09.682
"I have to go to the bathroom"?

15:09.776 --> 15:11.619
REGGIE: <i>Rachel Hortenthall
from Planned Parenthood</i>

15:11.711 --> 15:14.351
is heading to EEOB at 2:30 a.

15:14.447 --> 15:17.519
Boom, boom, shake-shake the womb!

15:17.583 --> 15:19.893
Selina's calling in the contraceptistas!

15:20.019 --> 15:21.396
We're gonna blog this shit to fuck.

15:21.454 --> 15:24.230
Mark, get a screen grab
of that fetus from the end of 2001, all right?

15:24.290 --> 15:25.462
Send it to me.

15:25.558 --> 15:27.970
- Maddox has just made a statement.
- What is it?

15:28.094 --> 15:31.701
"Science may give us the map,
but we are lost without morality's compass."

15:31.898 --> 15:34.879
"The right to free speech
includes the right to free thought."

15:35.034 --> 15:38.208
"I can't in all conscience
politicize this <i>as</i> an issue."

15:38.438 --> 15:40.748
- Ah.
- Jesus, what a talking gas giant.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.443
It's like listening to Jupiter.

15:42.542 --> 15:44.112
SELINA: Well, he fucking fudged it.

15:44.277 --> 15:47.224
So now we know he's running for president.
That stupid bastard.

15:47.313 --> 15:50.556
Ma'am, Maddox said nothing,
but at least he said something.

15:50.616 --> 15:52.721
We've literally said nothing.

15:52.785 --> 15:55.789
Meanwhile, that shit
shovel-faced fuckin' Jonah is out there

15:55.888 --> 15:57.731
telling people you're feeling out options.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.292
We need to pick a number.

15:59.392 --> 16:03.272
- No, I know, but I need to get clarity here.
- (GROANS)

16:03.396 --> 16:05.307
- I'm not feeling it.
- DAN: I was clear.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.068
I was clear.
We just need to pick a fucking number,

16:08.167 --> 16:09.237
any fucking number.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.111
Give that fucking number
to the fucking press,

16:11.170 --> 16:12.513
and go to fucking bed!

16:12.605 --> 16:14.312
How much more clarity do you need?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.683
You want to put it on a T-shin? Come on!

16:16.909 --> 16:18.354
(WHISTLES)

16:21.781 --> 16:25.024
I'm so sorry.
I did not mean to blow up like that.

16:27.587 --> 16:28.793
SELINA: Well...

16:31.591 --> 16:33.502
I accept your apology

16:33.759 --> 16:35.670
while retaining the right

16:35.995 --> 16:38.532
to fire the fuck out of you.

16:39.098 --> 16:41.704
Shall I print that up
on a T-shirt that I could give to you?

16:41.934 --> 16:43.641
This whole thing has got me on edge.

16:43.703 --> 16:46.183
I was puking my brains out
on that boat for hours.

16:46.272 --> 16:48.309
Jonah's got me absolutely homicidal.

16:48.608 --> 16:49.609
- (STUTTERING} I'm sorry.
- Uh-huh.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.780
- You need to apologize.
- He did apologize.

16:51.944 --> 16:53.355
You need it in writing!

16:53.513 --> 16:56.016
- Look, I love abortion, okay?
- Oh.

16:56.115 --> 16:57.788
I am an abortionado.

16:57.884 --> 16:59.192
But I would go pro-life

16:59.285 --> 17:01.287
in a fetal fucking heartbeat
if it meant winning.

17:01.387 --> 17:04.732
You're suggesting that you would like me
to be a hypocrite like Maddox?

17:05.391 --> 17:07.371
Okay, so you need to go home.

17:07.460 --> 17:08.837
Yes, ma'am.

17:10.896 --> 17:13.901
Moving on and Dan may be quite soon,

17:14.233 --> 17:16.304
someone needs to go get Cardinal Branzini.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.540
Oh, my God. The Catholics next.

17:18.738 --> 17:20.809
Madam Vice President, Cardinal Branzini.

17:20.906 --> 17:23.079
- Madam Vice President.
- Oh, Cardinal.

17:23.409 --> 17:26.321
- Am I in the right room?
-Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

17:26.878 --> 17:28.722
- Oh! Excuse you. (LAUGHS)
- Sorry. Excuse me.

17:29.215 --> 17:31.217
I'd love to take you into the inner sanctum.

17:31.317 --> 17:33.263
How very Dan Brown. (CHUCKLES)

17:33.352 --> 17:34.888
This way, Cardinal, thank you.

17:36.088 --> 17:37.226
SELINA: Come on in.

17:37.323 --> 17:39.929
Here's something else
to sew into your giant fucking crazy quilt.

17:40.159 --> 17:43.368
Jonah is now telling people that
Selina's meeting with Planned Parenthood.

17:43.563 --> 17:45.668
Go home. Take an Ambien. Take 50.

17:45.731 --> 17:48.541
She's talking to everyone.
I think the Amish are coming in next.

17:48.601 --> 17:51.912
I'm going home. And if anybody needs me,

17:52.171 --> 17:53.548
- I don't care.
- Night.

17:53.606 --> 17:56.382
We need to get in Rachel
what's-her-face from Planned Parenthood.

17:56.676 --> 17:59.384
- Gary, could you finesse that for me?
- Yes, yes.

17:59.612 --> 18:01.057
Ooh! I thought you were going to say Sue.

18:01.113 --> 18:03.525
I don't need an enhanced role
to know my worth, Gary.

18:03.583 --> 18:05.256
AMY: Mike, I need you to
steer in Cunningham.

18:05.351 --> 18:07.729
He's pro-life,
so keep him away from Rachel or he'll kill her.

18:07.853 --> 18:10.356
- Copy.
- AMY: Sue, help Kent finish polling now.

18:10.456 --> 18:14.268
Okay, but if he touches my hair,
I'm calling the police.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.566
- Okay.
- GARY: I don't need my bag.

18:16.862 --> 18:18.273
I don't need my bag.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.204
(LAUGHING) I don't need my bag.

18:21.601 --> 18:25.071
SELINA: I really did want to see you first,
Your Excellency,

18:25.204 --> 18:27.047
because I wanted to get
a little extra time with you.

18:27.607 --> 18:29.644
Let me just do one quick thing, excuse me.

18:31.744 --> 18:34.452
Make sure you cancel everything, please,

18:34.547 --> 18:36.390
so I can get plenty of time with the cardinal.

18:36.449 --> 18:38.122
Okay? Yeah.

18:39.785 --> 18:43.426
Okay, so now the phones
have taken a vow of silence.

18:43.556 --> 18:45.229
(SELINA LAUGHING)

18:46.425 --> 18:47.665
Okay, we're right this way.

18:47.793 --> 18:49.739
That is a gorgeous color on you, by the way.

18:49.795 --> 18:52.401
Thank you.
So where is the VP's thinking on this?

18:52.832 --> 18:55.745
Thinking...
There's a lot of numbers being thrown out.

18:55.801 --> 18:57.974
Speaking of numbers,
there's over 30,000 tiles...

18:58.070 --> 18:59.947
That's not really the kind of numbers
that I'm talking about.

19:00.006 --> 19:02.111
Okay, you know what? It's actually this way.

19:02.174 --> 19:03.244
Did you find the place okay?

19:03.409 --> 19:07.118
- Are you lost?
- No. This is what we call the grub hub.

19:07.613 --> 19:09.490
I'll see you at St. Stephen's on Sunday.

19:09.582 --> 19:10.788
- Excellent.
- Great.

19:11.651 --> 19:12.925
(WHISPERS) on, my God.

19:13.119 --> 19:14.826
Uh, thank you for your service.

19:14.920 --> 19:17.526
Of course, yes.
I have the vice president right here.

19:17.757 --> 19:19.862
Ma'am, I have the ACCDP on the line.

19:19.992 --> 19:21.300
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

19:21.460 --> 19:23.030
- WOMAN: Hello?
- Hello.

19:23.129 --> 19:25.006
- (WHISPERING) Who are they?
- Oh, the Anti...

19:25.097 --> 19:26.474
No, the Anti-abortion...

19:26.699 --> 19:30.010
No, the Association <i>of...</i> It's in my phone.

19:30.102 --> 19:33.106
<i>- Can you hear me?</i>
- Yes, I can. I can.

19:33.639 --> 19:35.550
<i>Madam Vice President. it's such an honor.</i>

19:35.641 --> 19:37.177
Thank you so, so much.

19:37.543 --> 19:40.046
You know,
I really did want to speak with you first

19:40.146 --> 19:42.524
because I wanted to make sure

19:42.615 --> 19:46.791
that we got a little extra time to talk together.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.020
(MOUTHING)

19:48.120 --> 19:50.964
<i>Frankly, ma'am,
our position hasn't changed one inch.</i>

19:52.291 --> 19:53.793
Well, you know what?

19:54.226 --> 19:56.968
It's a matter of conviction for me, too.

19:57.129 --> 19:59.006
- Pro-life.
- They're pro-choice.

19:59.231 --> 20:02.474
<i>I think our position 's pretty clear
from the title of our organization.</i>

20:02.568 --> 20:03.911
Yeah, of course.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.977
- ACCDP.
- Oh, my God.

20:08.140 --> 20:09.710
God, the lighting is so unflattering.

20:09.809 --> 20:12.688
Can I ask you a question?
Are you hiding from someone?

20:12.812 --> 20:13.847
(GARY CHUCKLES)

20:13.913 --> 20:15.654
Aren't we all hiding from somebody?

20:15.715 --> 20:17.058
I'm gonna make a quick call.

20:17.149 --> 20:18.594
Really quick, just really quick.

20:18.684 --> 20:19.719
(CHUCKLES)

20:19.819 --> 20:21.264
One second. So sorry.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.001
God!

20:25.925 --> 20:28.337
(WHISPERS) Get your shit together, Gary.

20:29.762 --> 20:31.708
You can do this. You can do this.

20:31.831 --> 20:32.832
(CLEARS THROAT)

20:34.433 --> 20:35.537
- Excuse me for just a minute.
- Uh...

20:36.502 --> 20:38.948
I realize that life is precious.

20:39.171 --> 20:43.347
"And so are the hard-won freedoms..."

20:44.243 --> 20:45.688
- Oh, thank God.
- WOMAN: <i>Thank</i> you, ma 'am.

20:45.778 --> 20:47.883
- SELINA: Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Good-bye.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.286
She was from the ADCCP. Sorry.

20:51.417 --> 20:53.624
- And who are they?
- I'm not quite sure.

20:53.719 --> 20:55.392
- Ah.
- It's in my phone.

20:55.688 --> 20:56.894
See that, ma'am?

20:58.190 --> 21:00.636
I've got Cunningham. I know, he's pro-choice.

21:01.026 --> 21:03.028
- BOTH: Life!
- Got it.

21:04.864 --> 21:06.639
- Okay, we're good. Yeah.
- Good?

21:06.732 --> 21:09.576
- Okay, that's good. I don't need any help.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

21:09.702 --> 21:11.704
- You like music?
- I suppose. Why?

21:11.937 --> 21:13.746
Oh, the new McCartney is worth checking out.

21:13.873 --> 21:16.149
- Right now, or can it wait?
- It can wait.

21:16.242 --> 21:17.380
You're in here.

21:18.377 --> 21:19.412
(SIGHS)

21:19.478 --> 21:21.389
The vice president will see you now...

21:22.114 --> 21:25.061
Uh, it's probably better if we go in separately,
wouldn't you think?

21:25.151 --> 21:26.630
Your right to choose, Amy.

21:26.886 --> 21:30.231
The vice president will see you now,
Mr. Cunningham.

21:31.991 --> 21:33.265
Pleasure to meet you.

21:34.493 --> 21:36.336
I've got some free lunch passes if you'd like...

21:36.428 --> 21:40.069
Listen. I've worked in DC for 10 years,
and I've never been treated like this.

21:40.132 --> 21:41.975
- Bundled around like a refugee?
- I'm sorry.

21:42.067 --> 21:43.341
I'm gonna back your boss, I always have.

21:43.435 --> 21:44.846
- But you need to quit this job...
- I know.

21:44.937 --> 21:46.746
And find something you're halfway decent at.

21:46.806 --> 21:49.150
Thank you. Yeah. Thank you so much.

21:49.241 --> 21:50.311
(SIGHS)

21:50.409 --> 21:52.821
<i>If this footage looks kind of like Cloverfield,</i>

21:52.912 --> 21:54.653
it's not because my hands shaking,

21:54.747 --> 21:57.660
it's because a fucking earthquake just hit DC!

21:58.250 --> 21:59.923
You feeling the heat, old media?

22:00.085 --> 22:02.929
<i>Because it's three strikes and you're out.</i>

22:04.089 --> 22:05.591
Tell them I'm coming in for 50.

22:06.258 --> 22:09.034
- They hung up.
- You know what? Fuck <i>Huff Po.</i>

22:09.128 --> 22:12.132
They should be called <i>Puff Ho</i>
'cause Arianna Huffington is a straight-up ho

22:12.198 --> 22:13.438
and all they do is puff pieces.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.945
Wait, request from MSNBC.

22:16.101 --> 22:19.048
They want you on at 7:00 a.m.
They're gonna send a car.

22:19.438 --> 22:21.315
Ha-ha. Got it!

22:21.373 --> 22:23.683
Ma'am, Chung's statement. 10 minutes early.

22:23.776 --> 22:25.312
Pulled a few strings
from my buddies down at...

22:25.377 --> 22:27.618
Please tell us about the strings, Mike,
don't tell us what's in it.

22:27.713 --> 22:31.525
Oh, sarcasm. That's an interesting strategy
for a potential campaign manager, Amy.

22:31.951 --> 22:33.362
Apologies. Rewind.

22:33.452 --> 22:35.329
Get the fuck on with it, Mike.
She's got a point. Let's go.

22:35.387 --> 22:37.025
Oh. Sorry. Just printed it. Haven't read it.

22:37.122 --> 22:38.658
Literally was trying to read it
when I was running over,

22:38.724 --> 22:39.862
so I couldn't do either.

22:39.959 --> 22:42.906
Okay, here we go. "First let me say
that I commend the president's clarity..."

22:42.995 --> 22:44.030
Skip that part.

22:44.163 --> 22:47.144
"Advances in science
have brought us to a moral conundrum..."

22:48.968 --> 22:51.141
"I believe a 22-week cutoff is appropriate."

22:51.670 --> 22:53.809
Has anyone ever come up
with that number before?

22:53.873 --> 22:54.977
Never.

22:55.241 --> 22:56.686
We're going to need a bigger melon.

22:56.742 --> 22:58.722
SELINA: Dan was right.
I've got to pick a number.

22:58.844 --> 23:01.723
Okay, well, obviously
we can just go anywhere now

23:01.814 --> 23:03.191
without going over 40.

23:03.249 --> 23:04.990
Half weeks? 22 and a half weeks.

23:05.084 --> 23:07.086
22 and a half weeks,
sounds like an erotic thriller.

23:07.353 --> 23:10.823
- What about days?
- Yes, like 140 days.

23:11.423 --> 23:14.336
- Which is in weeks...
- Divide by seven, Mike.

23:14.560 --> 23:17.234
- Two. .. 20.
- Yeah.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.741
I can't stick to 24 weeks now

23:19.832 --> 23:22.676
because that's gonna make me
the most liberal

23:22.902 --> 23:24.210
and the most female.

23:24.703 --> 23:27.547
Chung the Merciless did this, right?

23:27.673 --> 23:29.914
Why don't we double bluff him?
Just choose the same number.

23:30.009 --> 23:32.114
It's not like sharing a toothbrush.

23:32.444 --> 23:35.015
Mmm-mmm. Copycat Selina.
That's what they'll say.

23:35.180 --> 23:37.524
Me-Too Meyer, shit for brains...

23:37.683 --> 23:40.857
No, I'm sorry, they won't say that.
I'm just really tired.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.524
Should we all quit and go home

23:42.588 --> 23:44.090
and go to bed 'cause you're so tired?

23:44.189 --> 23:46.635
Oh, no, we can't. Because I have to go do

23:46.725 --> 23:48.966
<i>Good Morning America</i> thanks to you, Kent.

23:49.061 --> 23:51.940
I know, I'm sorry, ma'am.
I thought you could be first on air.

23:52.031 --> 23:54.705
I didn't realize Chung and Maddox
would attack at night.

23:54.767 --> 23:55.973
Must be their military training.

23:56.068 --> 23:58.446
Let me see this. What is this spike right here?

23:58.537 --> 23:59.777
The I Don't Knows.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.484
Okay, so I am looking at a page

24:02.574 --> 24:06.784
and I am seeing most of America
standing up proudly

24:06.879 --> 24:08.984
and saying, "I don't know."

24:09.081 --> 24:10.389
We were shocked ourselves.

24:10.549 --> 24:12.222
I wonder who should be

24:12.284 --> 24:15.390
my campaign strategist in the next election.

24:17.056 --> 24:18.626
- "I don't know."
- (CHUCKLES)

24:19.091 --> 24:21.833
I will redouble my efforts to win your support.

24:22.461 --> 24:23.963
The man's obsessed with me.

24:24.063 --> 24:26.407
Issue a version of what you said in the book,

24:26.465 --> 24:27.910
just better than what Dan wrote.

24:28.000 --> 24:30.742
Okay, Mike, you draft me a new version

24:30.803 --> 24:32.749
of my existing position, okay?

24:32.805 --> 24:34.580
- Love it.
- And I'm gonna need something to wear,

24:34.740 --> 24:36.686
'cause I'm going on <i>Good Morning America.</i>

24:36.775 --> 24:39.984
Pink. I got you pink. Let's do pink.

24:40.279 --> 24:42.281
<i>I believe that life is precious.</i>

24:42.348 --> 24:45.454
<i>And so are the hard-won freedoms</i>

24:45.517 --> 24:47.929

24:48.654 --> 24:51.533
<i>Uh, as a woman myself,</i>

24:51.824 --> 24:54.134
I know that freedom means the freedom...

24:54.259 --> 24:55.704
Thank you, sir.

24:55.794 --> 24:57.364
Did you get all the free water from the car?

24:57.463 --> 24:58.601
- Yeah.
- Nice.

24:58.664 --> 25:01.110
See, I told you, man.
Two days up and we're already big.

25:01.166 --> 25:03.669
This is what happens
when talent meets opportunity.

25:03.936 --> 25:05.438
Let's blow this thing wide open.

25:05.504 --> 25:06.847
DAN: Hey, Jo-nad.

25:06.939 --> 25:08.646
Dan, what the fuck are you doing here?

25:08.707 --> 25:11.483
You shouldn't tweet your location
to someone who wants to kill you, Jonah.

25:11.543 --> 25:13.113
Oh, so you do follow me.

25:13.178 --> 25:14.851
You know what?
I swear to God, I'm gonna rip your guts out

25:14.947 --> 25:17.120
through your tiny, shriveled,
little Chihuahua cock.

25:17.182 --> 25:19.560
What, nothing?
You're gonna let your boss get pasted?

25:19.651 --> 25:21.289
You're not my boss. We're copartners.

25:21.353 --> 25:22.457
I don't give a fuck.

25:23.455 --> 25:25.196
You're looking kind of hungry, Jonah.

25:25.624 --> 25:26.898
You want some of that burrito?

25:27.826 --> 25:30.500
No? Yeah? Hey, you, Ugly Betty,
give me that burrito.

25:30.963 --> 25:33.068
Don’t just give it to him, dude.

25:33.165 --> 25:34.200
- You see this, Jonah?
- Yeah.

25:34.299 --> 25:37.644
This is what happens
when you fuck with my office.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.080
If you say anything on-air about the Veep,

25:40.406 --> 25:43.250
I will break your legs so severely,
you'll end up normal height.

25:43.375 --> 25:44.752
Jake's on you, Dan,

25:44.843 --> 25:46.720
because I fucking love burritos.

25:46.812 --> 25:49.190
Yeah? Good luck with
your interview, handsome.

25:49.848 --> 25:51.850
- That's right, walk away, bitch.
- What did you say?

25:51.917 --> 25:53.260
- Nothing, nothing.
- DAN: What? Yeah.

25:53.485 --> 25:55.692
Joining us in studio is Jonah Ryan.

25:55.754 --> 25:58.667
<i>He was the former
White House liaison to the vice president.</i>

25:58.757 --> 26:01.033
<i>- Hi, Jonah. Nice to see you.
- Hello.</i>

26:01.093 --> 26:02.401
<i>What do you think is gonna happen here?</i>

26:02.494 --> 26:04.167
<i>Will the Veep go with POTUS,</i>

26:04.263 --> 26:06.834
<i>or could this
really be a defining moment for her?</i>

26:07.733 --> 26:11.943
(EXHALES) <i>Well, at Ryantology.net,
we have a saying,</i>

26:12.037 --> 26:16.417
<i>which is that these issues are like a prism.</i>

26:16.742 --> 26:18.415
<i>They have many sides.</i>

26:18.777 --> 26:20.450
<i>Would you care to pick one?</i>

26:20.779 --> 26:22.190
Of course. Um...

26:23.015 --> 26:26.553
<i>This is an issue
that has plagued politics for far too long.</i>

26:26.685 --> 26:27.959
And...

26:31.590 --> 26:32.625
<i>- Thanks for coming in, Jonah.
- Yeah, great.</i>

26:34.126 --> 26:36.629
Planned Parenthoods
Rachel Hortenthall is on the line.

26:36.728 --> 26:38.537
Hi, Rachel. Thanks so much for being here.

26:38.597 --> 26:40.270
Okay, you heard the Veep's statement.

26:40.365 --> 26:43.437
What do you at Planned Parenthood
have to say about it?

26:43.535 --> 26:46.607
RACHEL: <i>Unlike your previous guest,
we have a very clear take on this.</i>

26:46.705 --> 26:48.378
Well, I said nothing.

26:48.440 --> 26:52.217
A big, fat, morbidly obese nothing.

26:52.711 --> 26:53.951
At least you mentioned the book, ma'am.

26:54.046 --> 26:55.992
Your publisher is gonna be stoked.

26:56.081 --> 26:58.493
And I'm not wearing a flag pin.

26:58.584 --> 27:00.291
Whose fault is that, by the way?

27:00.552 --> 27:02.293
Look what I got. Look what I got.

27:02.387 --> 27:04.230
I got a special treat for you.

27:04.590 --> 27:05.625
Mmm!

27:05.724 --> 27:08.728
Gary, you are my angel of baked goods.

27:08.827 --> 27:10.966
Well, every angel needs an archangel.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.733
- Hey, Gary, come here.
- Oh, okay. Yes' ma'am.

27:14.633 --> 27:18.240
- Yeah? Mmm-hmm.
- You are always gonna be my body man.

27:19.771 --> 27:20.806
Yeah.

27:20.906 --> 27:23.079
(WHISPERS) Especially when I'm president.

27:23.575 --> 27:25.816
And I've got eight years
of treats planned for you.

27:25.911 --> 27:26.912
Yes, I do.

27:26.979 --> 27:27.980
(BOTH LAUGHING)

27:28.080 --> 27:29.650
I value you so much.

27:30.916 --> 27:32.987
- Go clear up the fruit out there.
- Yeah, okay.

27:34.000 --> 27:40.074

27:43.295 --> 27:45.206
I can put this in balls.

27:45.297 --> 27:47.470
Little watermelon balls in a bowl?

27:47.533 --> 27:49.638
- Definitely not.
- No? Okay.

27:50.936 --> 27:54.713
I can't watch myself anymore.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.210
GARY: Oh, um...

27:58.544 --> 28:00.956
- Don't put Oprah on. You don't like that.
- Mmm-mmm.

28:01.280 --> 28:03.226
- You wanna watch Top Chef?
- No.

28:03.348 --> 28:04.850
How about <i>Project Runway?</i>

28:05.217 --> 28:06.719
- No.
<i>- Survivor?</i>

28:06.818 --> 28:08.297
- Yeah.
- Okay.
