33:54.711 --> 33:58.084
I thought your client
was unemployed, Mr Wentworth?

33:58.118 --> 34:00.088
Haven't had very long
with the brief.

34:00.288 --> 34:01.324
No, far from it.

34:01.457 --> 34:04.665
Mr Jones is
our most promising employee.

34:04.697 --> 34:06.200
"Promising"?

34:06.333 --> 34:09.507
- At what exactly?
- Everything.

34:09.541 --> 34:11.310
I find that difficult
to believe.

34:11.443 --> 34:14.785
Well, I did, too,
at first, Your Honour.

34:14.818 --> 34:16.956
But you see, Mr Jones,

34:17.122 --> 34:20.228
who did grow up
so very poor,

34:20.328 --> 34:23.000
he was forced to leave school
at a very young age

34:23.034 --> 34:26.541
in order to support
his ailing mother, but...

34:26.641 --> 34:30.950
sadly drifted into
a rather unsavoury milieu.

34:31.083 --> 34:34.490
But he's now become
a shining example

34:34.624 --> 34:37.863
of the rehabilitative powers
of hard work

34:37.863 --> 34:37.964
of the rehabilitative powers
of hard work
and guidance from
the right sort of people.

34:37.964 --> 34:41.037
and guidance from
the right sort of people.

34:41.070 --> 34:43.608
[Judge] And what is
your business, Mr...

34:43.608 --> 34:43.609
[Judge] And what is
your business, Mr...
McLaren, Your Honour.

34:43.609 --> 34:46.013
McLaren, Your Honour.

34:46.213 --> 34:47.617
I and my family,

34:47.650 --> 34:51.691
we own and operate the Vivienne
Westwood ladieswear corporation.

34:51.825 --> 34:53.428
I don't know,
you might've heard of us.

34:53.562 --> 34:55.232
We have a number of boutiques.

34:55.398 --> 34:56.902
I'm entirely unaware of it.

34:56.935 --> 35:00.843
Well, that's not unusual
for a gentleman... Your Honour.

35:01.143 --> 35:04.817
However, I'm sure the fairer
members of your family,

35:04.817 --> 35:06.153
they would've heard of us.

35:06.286 --> 35:08.157
Given the serious nature
of this matter,

35:08.224 --> 35:12.366
I fear your rehabilitative
powers have failed you.

35:12.500 --> 35:14.370
I do... I blame myself,
Your Honour.

35:14.403 --> 35:17.275
You see, I was away in Paris
at the time, on business,

35:17.309 --> 35:19.313
and the only father figure

35:19.346 --> 35:22.285
that poor old Mr Jones
has ever really had

35:22.318 --> 35:25.593
was his great-uncle Dicky.
Isn't that right? Yes.

35:25.726 --> 35:27.195
He was a fighter pilot
during the war,

35:27.229 --> 35:29.166
and he was shot down
over Belgium.

35:29.199 --> 35:31.470
He subsequently lost his leg.

35:31.604 --> 35:34.109
He died on the night
of the incident.

35:34.143 --> 35:36.147
Uh... who died?

35:36.380 --> 35:37.850
Uncle Dicky.

35:38.819 --> 35:40.923
So, you see,
Mr Jones here,

35:40.956 --> 35:45.699
with no one of any real
moral compass to console him

35:45.699 --> 35:45.700
with no one of any real
moral compass to console him
in his moment of grief,

35:45.700 --> 35:47.202
in his moment of grief,

35:47.235 --> 35:50.442
well, he ran
with his old crowd

35:50.609 --> 35:53.147
and perhaps drank
rather too much

35:53.181 --> 35:56.454
and did go on to commit
this terrible crime.

35:56.487 --> 35:57.957
But...

35:59.560 --> 36:01.765
I give you my word,
Your Honour,

36:01.799 --> 36:05.272
that if you let this young,
silly fellow here

36:05.471 --> 36:08.378
have one more chance,

36:08.411 --> 36:10.482
I shall make it
my life's personal mission

36:10.616 --> 36:12.453
to see that he reaches
his true potential

36:12.553 --> 36:17.496
as a... truly astounding member
of this society.

36:19.299 --> 36:20.402
You're a bloody genius.

36:20.435 --> 36:22.138
Quickly now,
before he changes his mind.

36:22.172 --> 36:24.611
Honestly, no one's ever even
done anything like that for me.

36:24.677 --> 36:28.184
I don't think I'd ever even
done that for my own son.

36:28.384 --> 36:29.587
But still, I mean,

36:29.620 --> 36:31.157
how was I supposed to get you
to play your first gig?

36:31.190 --> 36:32.526
"Gig"?

36:32.626 --> 36:34.396
Gig, yes. That's what
a manager does, doesn't he?

36:34.564 --> 36:36.801
He lines up gigs for his band.

36:36.801 --> 36:36.835
He lines up gigs for his band.
You haven't even seen us play.

36:36.835 --> 36:38.639
You haven't even seen us play.

36:44.617 --> 36:48.024
But "Swankers", I mean, that's
got to go. It was terrible.

36:48.057 --> 36:49.426

it's "Kutie Jones".

36:49.527 --> 36:52.266
