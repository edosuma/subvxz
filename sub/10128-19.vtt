FEENY! YOU. HERE.
SIT. NOW.

00:28.200 --> 00:30.800
ERIC, DON'T USE THAT--

00:30.800 --> 00:31.867
DEAN BOLANDER.

00:31.867 --> 00:33.600
OK, WHAT YOU GOT?

00:33.600 --> 00:37.100
HOW OLD ARE YOU NOW,
MR. FEENY?
WHAT...90, 100?

00:37.100 --> 00:40.233
100...WHAT DO YOU WANT?

00:40.233 --> 00:41.600
NOT WHAT I WANT,
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT

00:41.600 --> 00:42.834
BUT YOU'RE NOT
GOING AFTER.

00:42.834 --> 00:46.567
ERIC, MY RELATIONSHIP
WITH DEAN BOLANDER

00:46.567 --> 00:49.133
WILL PROCEED AT
MY PACE, NOT YOURS.

00:49.133 --> 00:51.100
YOU ARE SUCH
A SCAREDY-CAT. I MEAN,

00:51.100 --> 00:53.200
HERE'S A WOMAN THAT
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY GOT
THE HOTS FOR

00:53.200 --> 00:54.767
AND YOU'RE NOT GONNA
DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

00:54.767 --> 00:57.100
MR. MATTHEWS, DON'T
REDUCE MY FEELINGS

00:57.100 --> 00:59.300
FOR THE WOMAN
TO "THE HOTS."

00:59.300 --> 01:02.100
UNLESS, OF COURSE,
SHE USED THAT TERM.

01:02.100 --> 01:04.100
MR. FEENY, YOU'VE
BEEN GOOD TO ME
OVER THE YEARS.

01:04.100 --> 01:06.100
YOU TAUGHT ME
EVERYTHING I NEVER
PAID ATTENTION TO.

01:06.100 --> 01:07.400
IT'S PAYBACK TIME.

01:07.400 --> 01:10.000
OH, NO, NO PAYBACK TIME.
I DON'T WANT IT. ERIC--

01:10.000 --> 01:11.600
IT'S OUT OF YOUR
HANDS, FEENY. SORRY.

01:11.600 --> 01:12.767
OUT OF YOUR HANDS,
FEENY.

01:12.767 --> 01:13.834
ERIC...

01:13.834 --> 01:15.867
DEAN BOLANDER IS
THE KIND OF WOMAN

01:15.867 --> 01:20.734
THAT YOU HAVE TO ROMANCE
SLOWLY, CAREFULLY...

01:20.734 --> 01:22.133
LIKE AN ORCHID.

01:22.133 --> 01:24.233
I'M A GARDENER.
I KNOW THESE THINGS.

01:24.233 --> 01:25.734
STOP SELLING ME,
GIRLS.

01:25.734 --> 01:27.967
I LIKE THE MAN
VERY MUCH.

01:27.967 --> 01:30.867
BUT HE NEEDS TO
PICK UP THE PACE
OF THIS DANCE.

01:30.867 --> 01:32.000
ISN'T THERE ANYTHING
TO BE SAID

01:32.000 --> 01:33.300
FOR THE OLD-FASHIONED
APPROACH?

01:33.300 --> 01:35.600
YEAH. PBBT!

01:35.600 --> 01:37.834
OH, I KNOW. HE NEEDS
TO DO SOMETHING.

01:37.834 --> 01:39.467
HE NEEDS TO EXPRESS
HIS FEELINGS.

01:39.467 --> 01:41.600
GOODNESS KNOWS I'VE
BEEN DROPPING THE MAN

01:41.600 --> 01:42.900
HINTS LEFT AND RIGHT.

01:42.900 --> 01:45.100
WELL, MAYBE YOU'RE
BEING TOO SUBTLE.

01:45.100 --> 01:47.400
I HIKED UP MY SKIRT
AT THE SEMINAR.

01:47.400 --> 01:49.600
DAMN!

01:49.600 --> 01:51.233
FEENY, THE TIME
IS NOW.

01:51.233 --> 01:52.233
EVERY SECOND
YOU WAIT

01:52.233 --> 01:54.300
IS ANOTHER
CLOGGED ARTERY.

01:54.300 --> 01:57.400
YOU KNOW, MY CHOLESTEROL
LEVEL IS HIGH.

01:57.400 --> 02:02.400
GEORGE, IF NOT
NOW...WHEN?

02:04.600 --> 02:05.667
NOW.

02:05.667 --> 02:06.600
THAT'S RIGHT!

02:06.600 --> 02:08.200
YOU ARE THE MAN,
YOU ARE THE MAN!

02:08.200 --> 02:09.367
OH, WILL YOU
GET LOST!

02:09.367 --> 02:10.700
I'M LOST, I'M LOST!
JUST BRING HER HOME.

02:10.700 --> 02:12.000
EXCUSE ME.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.300
UM...DEAN BOLANDER,

02:14.300 --> 02:15.400
YES?

02:15.400 --> 02:16.567
THERE'S SOMETHING

02:16.567 --> 02:19.367
THAT I HAVE BEEN
MEANING TO SAY TO YOU--

02:19.367 --> 02:20.500
THERE SHE IS!
LEILA BOLANDER,

02:20.500 --> 02:23.033
THE EIGHTH WONDER
OF THE WORLD!

02:23.033 --> 02:24.200
CURTIS!

02:24.200 --> 02:27.000
HA HA HA!

02:27.000 --> 02:29.233
HE MUST KNOW HER.

02:36.400 --> 02:38.600
WELL, CURTIS,
WHAT'S IT BEEN,
15 YEARS?

02:38.600 --> 02:41.367
ALL THIS TIME,
I'M RUNNING
AROUND THE WORLD,

02:41.367 --> 02:45.367
DIGGING UP BONES,
AND YOU'RE HERE
NOT AGING A DAY.

02:45.367 --> 02:47.967
DOESN'T SEEM FAIR...

02:47.967 --> 02:49.600
BUT I LIKE IT.

02:49.600 --> 02:51.300
RELAX, THIS GUY'S
GOT NOTHIN'.

02:51.300 --> 02:53.467
I WANT YOU TO MEET
SOMEONE. GEORGE?

02:53.467 --> 02:57.100
THIS IS MY COLLEAGUE
AND FRIEND GEORGE FEENY.

02:57.100 --> 02:58.500
CURT KINCAID.
PUT IT THERE!

02:58.500 --> 03:00.100
A PLEASURE,
MR. KINCAID.

03:00.100 --> 03:02.000
OH, COME ON. WHAT'S
WITH THE MISTER?

03:02.000 --> 03:04.500
IT'S DOCTOR.
[CLEARS THROAT]
DR. KINCAID.

03:04.500 --> 03:07.767
CURTIS IS IN TOWN
TO SPEAK AT OUR
SCIENCE SEMINAR.

03:07.767 --> 03:10.367
HE'S MADE SOME
TOP-SECRET FIND
IN AFRICA.

03:10.367 --> 03:11.600
OH, JUST
A LITTLE SOMETHING

03:11.600 --> 03:14.600
THAT WILL CHANGE
THE COURSE OF
THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

03:14.600 --> 03:15.734
HOO HOO HOO-HOO.

03:15.734 --> 03:17.567
SO THEN YOU'RE
AN ARCHAEOLOGIST?

03:17.567 --> 03:21.300
GEORGE, PLEASE,
THAT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE
A GEEZER WITH A COMPASS.

03:21.300 --> 03:26.033
I PREFER FORTUNE HUNTER,
ADVENTURER, OR...
MY PERSONAL FAVORITE,

03:26.033 --> 03:27.200
LEILA'S EX-HUSBAND.

03:27.200 --> 03:29.133
EX, IT'S
NO PROBLEM.

03:29.133 --> 03:32.200
BUT I'M HERE
TO WIN HER BACK.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.600
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'VE
BEEN ALONE THIS LONG.

03:35.600 --> 03:37.500
HOW ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
LIKE, A PUPPY?

03:37.500 --> 03:40.133
AND THE MAN STEPPED
IN BETWEEN THEM.

03:40.133 --> 03:42.100
AND THE COURSE OF TRUE
LOVE FOR ONE OF OUR OWN

03:42.100 --> 03:45.600
MAY HAVE FOREVER BEEN ALTERED
BY THIS... <i>SCHIVOSA. </i>

03:48.100 --> 03:50.600
WHY DO YOU COME
TO US NOW...

03:50.600 --> 03:55.400
ON THIS, THE DAY
OF OUR BAKE SALE?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.867
WELL, 'CAUSE THIS
JUST HAPPENED, LIKE,
5 MINUTES AGO.

03:57.867 --> 03:59.500
OK. WHAT DO YOU NEED?

03:59.500 --> 04:01.967
I NEED FOR YOU TO
DO ME THIS FAVOR.

04:01.967 --> 04:04.400
[SLURPS]

04:04.400 --> 04:07.400
YOU NEED ME TO
DO YOU THIS FAVOR?

04:07.400 --> 04:10.600
YOU NEVER INVITED ME
INTO YOUR HOME.

04:10.600 --> 04:13.867
YOU NEVER INVITED ME
FOR A CUP OF COFFEE.

04:13.867 --> 04:19.233
YES, I KNOW. AND
FOR THIS I AM SORRY.

04:19.233 --> 04:21.934
BUT...WE MUST
HELP FEENY,

04:21.934 --> 04:23.667
BUT HE MUSTN'T KNOW
THAT IT IS US.

04:23.667 --> 04:26.100
THIS IS THE BIGGEST JOB
WE'VE EVER ATTEMPTED
TO PULL OFF.

04:26.100 --> 04:28.367
I COME TO YOU WITH
MY HAT IN MY HAND--

04:28.367 --> 04:29.500
IT'S MY HAT.

04:29.500 --> 04:31.033
IT'S MY HAND.

04:31.033 --> 04:33.400
ARE YOU IN,
OR ARE YOU OUT?

04:33.400 --> 04:36.000
ERIC, WE'RE FLATTERED
YOU'VE COME TO US.

04:36.000 --> 04:39.033
BUT LOOK AROUND.
WE'RE LEGITIMATE NOW.

04:39.033 --> 04:42.567
WE'RE IN THE BAKE
SALE BUSINESS.

04:42.567 --> 04:45.600
GUYS, IT'S FEENY.
HE'S FAMILY.

04:45.600 --> 04:50.233
THIS MAY BE HIS
ONE CHANCE AT TRUE LOVE.

04:50.233 --> 04:54.233
ERIC, I JUST SPENT
68 BUCKS TRAVELING
AROUND THIS COUNTRY.

04:54.233 --> 04:56.734
I LEARNED A FEW
THINGS ABOUT LIFE.

04:56.734 --> 05:00.400
WHY DON'T YOU
TELL HIM WHAT YOU
LEARNED, SHAWN?

05:00.400 --> 05:02.500
[WHISPERING]
I love this part.

05:02.500 --> 05:04.667
I LEARNED TO BE
AT PEACE WITH MYSELF.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.133
I LIKE LOOKING
OVER MY SHOULDER

05:07.133 --> 05:08.767
AND NOT WORRYING ABOUT
WHO'S COMING AFTER ME.

05:13.567 --> 05:17.200
THESE SCHEMES AND CAPERS
I USED TO HATCH, THEY
ONLY LEAD TO DESPAIR.

05:17.200 --> 05:19.400
THAT'S WHAT I LEARNED.

05:19.400 --> 05:21.667
I ALSO LEARNED NEVER
TO PARK A TRAILER

05:21.667 --> 05:24.000
ACROSS A RAILROAD TRACK
WHEN THAT THING IS DOWN.

05:26.500 --> 05:29.967
BESIDES, ERIC, I HIT
A TEACHER, REMEMBER?

05:29.967 --> 05:31.100
YES.

05:31.100 --> 05:33.233
THE DEAN PUT ME
ON PROBATION.

05:33.233 --> 05:37.967
I DO ONE
THING WRONG,
I'M OUTTA HERE.

05:37.967 --> 05:40.000
DON'T YOU THINK THAT FEENY
CAN TAKE CARE OF HIMSELF?

05:40.000 --> 05:41.200
I'M ASHAMED.

05:41.200 --> 05:44.100
I AM ASHAMED TO
CALL YOU GUYS MY
BROTHER AND SHAWN.

06:00.467 --> 06:02.000
HE ATE THE PAPER.

06:10.934 --> 06:12.734
WHAT-WHAT'S THE MATTER?

06:12.734 --> 06:14.867
JACK, YOU KNOW,
I REALLY LOVE THIS.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.934
BUT HAVE YOU NOTICED
THAT THIS IS ALL WE DO?

06:16.934 --> 06:19.700
YEAH. ISN'T IT GREAT?

06:19.700 --> 06:23.300
YEAH, YEAH,
IT IS GREAT, JACK.
BUT...I WANT MORE.

06:23.300 --> 06:25.300
OH, THANK YOU!

06:25.300 --> 06:27.500
WELL, MORE IS RIGHT
THIS WAY.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.133
OH, JACK, NO,
I MEAN...

06:29.133 --> 06:30.967
I WANT US TO
BE A COUPLE.

06:30.967 --> 06:32.300
WE ARE A COUPLE.

06:32.300 --> 06:33.700
I WANT TO GO OUT, JACK.

06:33.700 --> 06:35.367
WE HAVEN'T GONE OUT SINCE
WE'VE BECOME A COUPLE.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.500
WHY DON'T WE
EVER GO ANYWHERE?

06:36.500 --> 06:37.767
WE GO PLENTY OF PLACES.

06:37.767 --> 06:41.467
FIRST YOU WENT THERE,
THEN YOU WENT THERE...

06:41.467 --> 06:43.834
NOW WE'RE GONNA
GO UP THERE.

06:43.834 --> 06:47.767
JACK, I WANNA
BE WITH PEOPLE.
I WANNA GO DANCING.

06:47.767 --> 06:53.000
UHH...UM, LET'S GO
TO THE MOVIES.

06:53.000 --> 06:55.400
THE MOVIES ARE DARK,
AND NO ONE WILL SEE US,

06:55.400 --> 06:57.300
AND I WANNA SHOW YOU OFF.

06:57.300 --> 06:59.567
I WANNA GO DANCING, JACK.

06:59.567 --> 07:00.800
YOU CAN DANCE, RIGHT?

07:00.800 --> 07:02.867
YEAH, I CAN DANCE.

07:02.867 --> 07:05.000
GREAT, THEN WE'LL GO
DANCING TOMORROW NIGHT.

07:05.000 --> 07:08.100
OH, JACK, THIS IS GOING
TO BE SO MUCH FUN!

07:08.100 --> 07:09.867
I CAN'T WAIT.

07:14.000 --> 07:17.200
SO, I JUMP OFF THE CLIFF,

07:17.200 --> 07:19.700
GRAB HOLD OF
A BIG OLD BRANCH,

07:19.700 --> 07:21.300
JUNGLE-GYM TO THE RIVER,

07:21.300 --> 07:25.100
AND NEVER SAW CHIEF YAKAZO'S
UGLY MUG AGAIN.

07:25.100 --> 07:28.000
AND THE CURSED RUBY
OF THE TZANG-KWAI

07:28.000 --> 07:31.600
NOW RESIDES IN THE TURKISH
MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY

07:31.600 --> 07:35.233
DIAGONALLY ACROSS FROM
THE HARD ROCK CAFE. THE END!

07:42.500 --> 07:43.967
WOW.
WOW.

07:43.967 --> 07:45.667
HEY, WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

07:45.667 --> 07:50.300
WELL, THANK YOU
DR. KINCAID FOR THAT,
UH, VIVID STORY,

07:50.300 --> 07:53.567
WHICH PROVIDES US WITH
A PERFECT TRANSITION

07:53.567 --> 07:55.200
INTO TODAY'S ASSIGNMENT,

07:55.200 --> 07:57.934
WHERE ON NEIGHBORING CRETE

07:57.934 --> 08:01.800
WE WILL FIND
SIR ARTHUR EVANS

08:01.800 --> 08:06.567
EXCAVATING AT MINOAN KNOSSOS,
BEGINNING IN 1899.

08:06.567 --> 08:09.400
[COUGHS] YOU'RE DYING.
DO SOMETHING.

08:09.400 --> 08:14.000
WE WILL READ
WHAT EVANS WAS MOST
INTERESTED IN EXCAVATING

08:14.000 --> 08:17.600
AND THE EFFECT IT HAD
ON ARCHAEOLOGY
IN THE 20th CENTURY.

08:17.600 --> 08:20.400
PONDEROUS, MAN,
PONDEROUS.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.033
GEORGE IS A FINE
EDUCATOR, CURTIS.

08:23.033 --> 08:25.900
SORRY, BUT WHEN
YOU'VE HAD THESE
EXPERIENCES FIRSTHAND,

08:25.900 --> 08:28.500
IT'S A LITTLE HARD
TO GET EXCITED
ABOUT READING A BOOK.

08:28.500 --> 08:32.934
BUT I SUPPOSE READING
IS A LOT SAFER THAN
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING.

08:39.467 --> 08:42.734
I FEEL AS THOUGH
THIS GENTLEMAN MAY
REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION.

08:42.734 --> 08:45.300
PERHAPS A LESSON
IN HUMILITY.

08:45.300 --> 08:46.700
SOMETHING BIG.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.100
SOMETHING SPECTACULAR.

08:49.867 --> 08:52.200
BUT LET'S NOT GET
CAUGHT LIKE ALL
THE OTHER TIMES, OK?

08:52.200 --> 08:53.367
OK.

08:59.000 --> 09:02.967
HO HO. SHAWNY,
OF ALL THE PLANS
WE'VE CONCOCTED,

09:02.967 --> 09:04.233
THIS IS THE BEST ONE.

09:04.233 --> 09:07.600
AND WE HAVE CONCOCTED
SOME DOOZIES.

09:07.600 --> 09:09.200
AND FEENY ALWAYS
CAUGHT US.

09:09.200 --> 09:11.500
YEAH, HE ALWAYS
HAD US FIGURED OUT.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.600
BUT WE'RE IN COLLEGE
NOW. WE'RE OLDER,
WE'RE WISER.

09:14.600 --> 09:16.200
YOU THINK HE'S UP
TO THE CHALLENGE?

09:16.200 --> 09:18.800
IT'S US AGAINST HIM,
LIVING ON
THE EDGE, BABE.

09:18.800 --> 09:21.133
I LIKE WHEN YOU
CALL ME BABE.

09:23.000 --> 09:27.233
ALL RIGHT. SO, ERIC SAID
THIS GUY CURTIS
STORED ALL THE STUFF

09:27.233 --> 09:29.100
FROM HIS LAST DIG HERE
IN THE SCIENCE LAB.

09:29.100 --> 09:30.400
YEAH, HE SUPPOSEDLY
GOT SOMETHING

09:30.400 --> 09:32.300
THAT'S GONNA ALTER THE COURSE
OF THE NEW MILLENNIUM.

09:32.300 --> 09:35.200
ARE WE READY TO
EXECUTE PHASE ONE
OF OUR MASTER PLAN?

09:35.200 --> 09:37.100
READY. LET'S MESS
THIS PLACE UP.

09:42.000 --> 09:43.800
YOU KNOW, SHAWNY,
I HONESTLY DON'T SEE

09:43.800 --> 09:45.000
HOW ANYTHING COULD
BE SIMPLER.

09:45.000 --> 09:46.967
THIS IS CHILD'S PLAY.

09:46.967 --> 09:49.100
WHAT'S THIS, A BRAIN?

09:49.100 --> 09:50.767
THAT'S GOTTA BE
HIS DISCOVERY.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.967
HE'S DISCOVERED
THE WORLD'S
FIRST BRAIN.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.934
THIS GETS OUT,
FEENY'LL NEVER
GET THE DEAN.

09:54.934 --> 09:57.700
YOU COULD GET ANY
WOMAN WITH THE WORLD'S
FIRST BRAIN.

09:57.700 --> 10:01.467
COULD I GET TOPANGA?

10:01.467 --> 10:02.967
YEAH, I THINK YOU COULD.

10:02.967 --> 10:03.834
WHOO HOO!

10:03.834 --> 10:05.200
WHOA, WHOA, HEY.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.033
THAT JAR'S BEEN CLOSED
FOR 5,000 YEARS.

10:07.033 --> 10:09.000
YOU KNOW, THIS MUST BE
THE WORLD'S FIRST JAR.

10:09.000 --> 10:10.600
HOW DO I GET
THIS THING OPEN?

10:10.600 --> 10:12.734
WELL, HERE, HERE.
HAND ME THE RARE
PHOENICIAN MALLET.

10:12.734 --> 10:16.700
NO, NO, NO, NO,
THAT'S AN EARLY
EGYPTIAN DENTAL TOOL.

10:16.700 --> 10:17.900
THERE WE GO.

10:19.967 --> 10:22.100
PHOENICIAN PIECE
OF CRAP.

10:22.100 --> 10:25.800
SHAWN, YOU BROKE IT.
THAT'S NOT PART
OF THE PLAN.

10:25.800 --> 10:27.667
I'LL REPLACE IT.
I SEE THEM ALL THE TIME

10:27.667 --> 10:30.000
AT BED, BATH
AND PHOENICIAN.

10:30.000 --> 10:33.000
HERE, HAND ME
THE BYZANTINE STATUE
OF KING HAFARATU.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.600

THERE'S 6 BILLION
OF THEM LEFT.

10:48.233 --> 10:51.967
WOW. THE HUMAN BRAIN.

10:53.967 --> 10:57.467
THE THING THAT SEPARATES
US FROM THE ANIMALS.

10:57.467 --> 10:59.767
'CAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE
AN ANIMAL BRAIN.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.200
YEAH.

11:01.200 --> 11:03.700
I HOLD IN MY HANDS

11:03.700 --> 11:07.233
THE PINNACLE OF
GOD'S CREATION.

11:07.233 --> 11:08.300
THINK FAST!

11:14.700 --> 11:17.467
YOU WANT PERSONALITY
OR MOTOR SKILLS?

11:22.000 --> 11:26.934
ENERGY CAN BE EMITTED
OR ABSORBED BY MATTER,

11:26.934 --> 11:31.033
BUT ONLY IN SMALL, DISCREET
UNITS CALLED QUANTA.

11:31.033 --> 11:33.467
FEENY, STOP HIDING
BEHIND YOUR BOOKS!

11:33.467 --> 11:38.734
ALSO FUNDAMENTAL
TO THE DEVELOPMENT
OF QUANTUM PHYSICS

11:38.734 --> 11:41.233
WAS THE UNCERTAINTY
PRINCIPLE.

11:41.233 --> 11:43.600
OH, FEENY,
YOU'RE IN PAIN.

11:43.600 --> 11:46.100
ERIC, YOU'RE NOT
EVEN IN THIS CLASS.

11:46.100 --> 11:47.834
BUT SOMEONE WHO
IS PERFECTLY FINE

11:47.834 --> 11:50.367
DOES NOT LET
SOME WORLD-FAMOUS
SUPER-DUPER EXPLORER GUY

11:50.367 --> 11:54.133
WHO'S 5 TIMES THE MAN
YOU'LL EVER BE SWOOP IN
AND TAKE YOUR BOOTY.

11:54.133 --> 11:55.600
SHE IS NOT MY BOOTY!

11:59.600 --> 12:01.800
AND IF SHE WAS MY BOOTY,

12:01.800 --> 12:05.200
I WOULD PREFER NOT
TO TALK ABOUT MY BOOTY...

12:05.200 --> 12:07.567
IN FRONT OF
THE ENTIRE CLASS.

12:07.567 --> 12:11.200
LOOK, COME ON, FEENY.
EVERYBODY KNOWS.

12:11.200 --> 12:12.567
NO ONE KNOWS.

12:12.567 --> 12:17.100
I HAVE BEHAVED
IN A MANNER BEFITTING
A MAN OF MY STATION.

12:17.100 --> 12:18.200
WORD SALAD, FEENY.

12:18.200 --> 12:20.300
OK, WHO HERE KNOWS
WHO FEENY LOVES?

12:20.300 --> 12:22.200
THE DEAN!
THE DEAN!
THE DEAN!

12:22.200 --> 12:24.834
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY OUT.

12:24.834 --> 12:26.767
WE'RE JUST ROOTING
FOR YOU, MR. FEENY.

12:26.767 --> 12:28.100
WHY WON'T YOU MAKE
YOUR MOVE?

12:28.100 --> 12:32.100
ERIC, IN A WORLD THAT
IS NOT RUN BY SAVAGES,

12:32.100 --> 12:34.834
THERE IS SUCH
A THING AS DECORUM.

12:34.834 --> 12:36.700
NOW, DECORUM WOULD SUGGEST

12:36.700 --> 12:40.800
THAT A GENTLEMAN ALLOW
A LADY TO RESOLVE

12:40.800 --> 12:42.867
AN OLD RELATIONSHIP

12:42.867 --> 12:44.900
BEFORE HE ENGAGES HER
IN A NEW ONE.

12:44.900 --> 12:47.400
YES, BUT, SEE,
YOU'RE ALREADY IN
A NEW RELATIONSHIP!

12:47.400 --> 12:49.300
YOU'RE IN
A TRIANGLE, FEENY,

12:49.300 --> 12:51.667
AND TAKE IT FROM
SOMEBODY WHOSE BEEN
IN A TRIANGLE BEFORE,

12:51.667 --> 12:53.400
HE WHO HESITATES
IS LOST.

12:53.400 --> 12:54.900
RACHEL!

12:57.300 --> 12:59.400
I'M OK, I'M OK...

12:59.400 --> 13:01.033
I'M FINE.
I'M JUST LIKE YOU.

13:01.033 --> 13:04.500
OH, DEAR, I DON'T WANT
TO BE LIKE YOU.

13:04.500 --> 13:05.834
[SOBS]

13:06.967 --> 13:08.567
CORY, LOOK WHAT
YOU DID.

13:08.567 --> 13:10.500
YOU HAD
A PERFECTLY GOOD
WORLD'S FIRST BRAIN

13:10.500 --> 13:11.834
AND NOW LOOK AT IT.

13:11.834 --> 13:13.100
I'M SORRY.

13:13.100 --> 13:15.967
WELL, WELL, HERE.
JUST, LIKE, SMOOSH
IT BACK TOGETHER

13:15.967 --> 13:17.200
AND PUT IT BACK
IN THE JAR.

13:17.200 --> 13:18.133
I WILL.

13:19.767 --> 13:20.934
YOU KNOW WHAT?

13:20.934 --> 13:22.567
I BETTER HIDE THIS
BECAUSE--

13:24.567 --> 13:25.567
UH-OH.

13:25.567 --> 13:28.500
OH, YOU BROKE
ANOTHER JAR.

13:28.500 --> 13:30.467
WONDER WHAT WAS
IN THAT ONE.

13:30.467 --> 13:31.667
[BEE BUZZES]

13:31.667 --> 13:32.867
Cory: WHOA!

13:32.867 --> 13:34.700
WHOA. THAT IS
ONE ANGRY BEE.

13:34.700 --> 13:37.200
ALL RIGHT,
FORGET THE BEE.
ON TO PHASE 2.

13:37.200 --> 13:40.500
YEAH. HOW ABOUT
WE OPEN A WINDOW
FOR SOME AIR?

13:40.500 --> 13:41.767
WAIT A MINUTE, SHAWN...

13:41.767 --> 13:44.100
WON'T OPENING A WINDOW
SET OFF AN ALARM?

13:44.100 --> 13:45.400
[ALARM SOUNDS]

13:45.400 --> 13:48.367
OH, MAN. WE NEVER
LEARN ANYTHING, DO WE?

13:48.367 --> 13:51.000
NO, AND NOW THE TEACHER
FROM NEXT DOOR'S GONNA
HEAR THAT ALARM.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.467
AND HE'S GONNA COME
IN HERE ALL MAD.

13:52.467 --> 13:54.200
AND I WONDER WHO
THAT TEACHER'S GONNA BE.

13:55.900 --> 13:57.967
Both:
OH, NO. IT'S FEENY.

14:00.066 --> 14:01.734
WHAT'S GOING ON IN HERE?

14:02.800 --> 14:03.800
NOTHING.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.100
WE DIDN'T BREAK
THIS STUFF.

14:05.100 --> 14:06.934
WELL, WHO DID?

14:06.934 --> 14:08.300
YOU DID!
AND WE'RE TELLING!

14:13.100 --> 14:14.200
HEY!

14:18.800 --> 14:20.200
COME ON OUT, JACK.

14:20.200 --> 14:21.900
I WANNA SEE
HOW GOOD YOU LOOK.

14:26.600 --> 14:28.100
HOW YA DOING?

14:29.400 --> 14:31.300
OK, SOMETHING'S DIFFERENT.

14:31.300 --> 14:32.367
YEAH, AND WE'RE
GOING OUT.

14:32.367 --> 14:33.734
LET'S GO. HEY HEY.

14:33.734 --> 14:35.300
OH, WAIT A SECOND.

14:35.300 --> 14:36.467
YOU'RE TALL.

14:36.467 --> 14:38.300
YEAH. SO ARE YOU.
LET'S GO.

14:38.300 --> 14:40.367
NO, I MEAN I'M LOOKING
STRAIGHT AHEAD,

14:40.367 --> 14:42.867
AND SUDDENLY YOU'RE
IN MY FIELD OF VISION.

14:42.867 --> 14:43.900
WHAT DID YOU DO?

14:43.900 --> 14:45.300
WELL, I'M STANDING UP
STRAIGHT.

14:45.300 --> 14:47.000
YOU KNOW ME,
I'M A SCHLUMP.

14:47.000 --> 14:50.200
I'M A REAL, UH,

WELL, LET'S GO.
HEY HEY.

14:52.033 --> 14:54.000
WHAT IS ON YOUR FEET?

14:54.000 --> 14:55.300
MY DANCING SHOES.

14:55.300 --> 14:57.667
JACK, YOU BOUGHT
ELEVATOR SHOES.

14:57.667 --> 14:59.000
THEY'RE NOT ELEVATOR SHOES.

14:59.000 --> 15:00.800
THE GUY NEVER CALLED
THEM ELEVATOR SHOES.

15:00.800 --> 15:01.967
OH, WHAT DID HE
CALL THEM?

15:01.967 --> 15:03.800
"MANLY STEP-UPS."

15:03.800 --> 15:04.867
OH, JACK!

15:04.867 --> 15:06.100
WHAT?

15:06.100 --> 15:08.367
THAT'S WHY YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO GO OUT WITH ME,

15:08.367 --> 15:09.800
BECAUSE YOU'RE
TOO EMBARRASSED
TO BE SEEN WITH ME

15:09.800 --> 15:10.834
'CAUSE I'M SO TALL.

15:10.834 --> 15:12.100
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:12.100 --> 15:13.800
MY WHOLE LIFE I'VE
BEEN THE TALL ONE,

15:13.800 --> 15:15.867
THE BEAN POLE.
I NEVER THOUGHT THAT.

15:15.867 --> 15:17.567
"HEY STILTS, HOW'S
THE WEATHER UP THERE?"

15:17.567 --> 15:19.100
YOU'RE CRAZY.
YOU KNOW WHY I DIDN'T
WANT TO GO OUT WITH YOU?

15:19.100 --> 15:20.300
'CAUSE I THOUGHT THEY'D SAY,

"HEY, LOOK AT THE MODEL
WITH THAT SHRIMP."

WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

15:24.033 --> 15:25.400
YOU'VE NEVER BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT THIS

15:25.400 --> 15:26.600
BEFORE WHEN
WE'VE BEEN OUT.

15:26.600 --> 15:28.200
YEAH, BUT WE'VE ONLY
BEEN OUT AS FRIENDS.

15:28.200 --> 15:30.900
I NEVER REALLY
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS
UNTIL WE GOT TOGETHER.

15:30.900 --> 15:33.233
YOU KNOW WHAT?
TO BE HONEST...

15:33.233 --> 15:35.834
I NEVER THOUGHT YOU'D
BE INTERESTED IN ME.

15:35.834 --> 15:39.834
WELL, I AM INTERESTED
IN YOU, JACK...

15:41.200 --> 15:42.600
BUT NOT IN THOSE.

15:42.600 --> 15:43.500
OK.

15:44.934 --> 15:48.500
YOU KNOW WHAT? I WOULD
LOVE TO GO DANCING.

15:48.500 --> 15:50.567
REALLY? YOU MEAN,
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY?

15:50.567 --> 15:55.700
YES, IN FRONT OF
THE WHOLE WORLD.

15:55.700 --> 15:57.133
ALL RIGHT, LET'S DANCE.

OH, JACK.
COME ON.

FOR YOU.

16:16.000 --> 16:17.767
WHAT?

16:17.767 --> 16:20.133
THIS? I DIDN'T
DO THIS.

16:20.133 --> 16:21.967
I DIDN'T BELIEVE THEM
WHEN THEY TOLD ME,

16:21.967 --> 16:23.767
BUT IT'S HARD TO ARGUE
WITH SOMETHING

OF YOUR FACE.

AS SHOCKED AS
YOU ARE, DEAN.

PUT THE BRAIN DOWN!

16:32.200 --> 16:35.300
WHAT IN HEAVEN'S NAME
WERE YOU THINKING OF
WHEN YOU DID THIS?

16:35.300 --> 16:37.567
I DIDN'T DO IT!
THEY DID IT!

16:37.567 --> 16:38.934
OH!

16:57.667 --> 16:59.300
UH, YOU KNOW
SOMETHING, DEAN,

16:59.300 --> 17:01.867

JUST AN ACT OF LOVE

19:51.834 --> 19:54.300
I WANT TO THANK YOU
AGAIN FOR GOING EASY
ON THE BOYS.

19:54.300 --> 19:58.800
OH. GEORGE, ONE OF
THE REASONS I WAS
ATTRACTED TO YOU

19:58.800 --> 20:00.800
WAS BECAUSE I'VE
NEVER SEEN A TEACHER
WHOSE STUDENTS

20:00.800 --> 20:03.400
WERE WILLING TO GO
TO SUCH LENGTHS
TO SEE HIM HAPPY.

20:03.400 --> 20:06.734
YOU NEVER ACTUALLY THOUGHT
I WAS THE PERPETRATOR?

20:06.734 --> 20:11.900
OH, I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT
YOU'RE CAPABLE OF ACTING
WITH RECKLESS ABANDON.

20:11.900 --> 20:13.734
OH, I AM, I AM.

20:13.734 --> 20:16.467
HEY! WELL,
THIS IS GREAT,
ISN'T IT?

20:16.467 --> 20:19.800
I MEAN, YOU LOVE HIM,
HE LOVES YOU,
I LOVE YOU BOTH.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.200
WE'RE A TRIANGLE.

20:21.200 --> 20:23.367
NOW, UM, DEAN,
THERE'S SOMETHING
YOU SHOULD KNOW.

20:23.367 --> 20:25.300
FEENY AND I LIKE
TO HANG OUT
QUITE A BIT,

20:25.300 --> 20:28.900
SO, IF I'M EVER
AROUND AND YOU GUYS
ARE GETTING...FRISKY

20:28.900 --> 20:30.700
OR WHATEVER IT IS
THAT YOU GUYS DO,

20:30.700 --> 20:32.300
I'M GONNA NEED
SOME KIND OF A SIGNAL

20:32.300 --> 20:34.233
TO KNOW THAT IT'S MY
TIME...THIS'LL WORK.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.100
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

20:43.100 --> 20:45.000
WE ARE PERFECT
FOR EACH OTHER.
PERFECT.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.567
HI, MRS. BERTELSON.

20:46.567 --> 20:48.400
SHE'S TOO TALL FOR YOU.

20:48.400 --> 20:50.500
JACK, STOP, STOP!
OK, OK, OK.

20:50.500 --> 20:52.500
JACK, LOOK, LOOK,
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

20:52.500 --> 20:54.700
YOU SAID YOU WEREN'T
GONNA LET THIS
BOTHER YOU, OK?

20:54.700 --> 20:56.467
IT'S NO PROBLEM.
I'M OK.

20:56.467 --> 20:59.600
I HOPE THE CABLE BREAKS,
MRS. BERTELSON!

20:59.600 --> 21:02.967
JACK, WHY DON'T
WE GO INSIDE AND
MAKE US SNUGGLY?

21:02.967 --> 21:04.800
YES. I'M NOT
TOO SHORT FOR THAT.

21:04.800 --> 21:06.467
I KNOW.

21:08.867 --> 21:10.200
HEY. HEY!

21:10.200 --> 21:12.300
COME ANY CLOSER
AND I'LL CLUB YA.

21:15.233 --> 21:17.400
SHE'S TOO TALL
FOR YOU.
