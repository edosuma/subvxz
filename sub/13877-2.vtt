Snort the confidence into
your mucus passages.

08:07.760 --> 08:09.330

08:09.400 --> 08:10.810
Ooh, feels good.

08:10.870 --> 08:14.400
You're now wild

08:14.470 --> 08:18.140
I'm wild and bulletproof, motherfucker!

08:18.210 --> 08:19.780
Take the shovel.

Fuck football!

08:27.020 --> 08:27.960

08:28.020 --> 08:29.890
Inject it between my toes.

08:29.950 --> 08:31.450
I mustn't have tracks.

08:31.520 --> 08:33.970

08:34.020 --> 08:36.530

08:36.590 --> 08:38.330
Oh god.

08:38.390 --> 08:40.370

08:46.500 --> 08:49.110
[snoring]

08:49.500 --> 08:51.310
I am in trouble, big time.

08:51.370 --> 08:52.320
You know how you say

08:52.370 --> 08:55.050
don't talk to nobody at the mall
'cause they a bad influence?

08:55.110 --> 08:57.920
I'm hanging out with someone
who is a bad influence.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.480
Does this have anything to do
with that cop?

09:00.380 --> 09:01.330

Uh, maybe.

09:06.820 --> 09:09.170
You see that hat on his head,
Meatwad?

09:09.220 --> 09:11.500
The magic hat that I told you
not to put there?

09:11.560 --> 09:13.600
That's not how I remember it,
but yes.

09:13.660 --> 09:14.900
Yeah, I see it.

09:14.960 --> 09:15.910
Take it off.

09:15.960 --> 09:17.240
No way. That dude's crazy.

09:17.300 --> 09:18.240
If I get near that hat

09:18.300 --> 09:20.250
he's gonna stab me with about
three of them needles.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.250
FRYLOCK:
Okay, fine.

09:21.300 --> 09:23.250
He's gonna have to
shampoo sometime.

09:23.300 --> 09:25.810
And when he does,
we'll be right there.

09:27.080 --> 09:28.350
Hey, you have any shampoo?

09:28.410 --> 09:30.360
Oh you're gonna wash your
hair tonight...

09:30.410 --> 09:32.080
None of your goddamn
business.

09:32.150 --> 09:33.120
I'm going out tonight.

09:33.180 --> 09:35.350

to shampoo my hair,

09:35.420 --> 09:37.050

09:37.120 --> 09:38.500
