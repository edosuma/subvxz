00:05.289 --> 00:08.325
There's a male who's really maniacal.

00:08.326 --> 00:10.527
He likes walking up right behind 'em.

00:10.528 --> 00:13.062
I feel as though I'm being watched.

00:13.063 --> 00:16.065
I looked around, and
there was no one there.

00:16.065 --> 00:17.867
I want it to be over.

00:17.868 --> 00:21.588
I don't feel comfortable here.

00:22.006 --> 00:23.706
Were their bodies ever found?

00:23.707 --> 00:24.604
This is bad.

00:24.605 --> 00:26.143
I'd like to have some answers.

00:26.144 --> 00:28.145
Do you know what happened?

00:28.146 --> 00:30.726
Everybody dies.

00:32.816 --> 00:35.197
They're being watched.

00:35.198 --> 00:38.221
My name is Amy Allan.

00:38.222 --> 00:40.290
This thing likes death.

00:40.291 --> 00:42.058
I see dead people.

00:42.059 --> 00:43.707
This thing is, like, a monster.

00:43.708 --> 00:45.595
I speak to dead people...

00:45.596 --> 00:47.466
And he's pissed off now.

00:47.467 --> 00:48.889
And they speak to me.

00:48.890 --> 00:50.441
His head was cracked.

00:50.442 --> 00:53.336
But there's only one way to
know if my findings are real.

00:53.337 --> 00:56.906
This guy was murdered.
I rely on my partner.

00:56.907 --> 00:58.316
I'm Steve Di Schiavi.

00:58.317 --> 01:00.293
I'm a retired New York
City homicide Detective.

01:00.294 --> 01:03.112
I cannot help you unless
I know the whole story.

01:03.113 --> 01:06.283
And I know every person,
every house has secrets.

01:06.284 --> 01:08.951
You saw her? It's my job to reveal them.

01:08.952 --> 01:10.300
Why would you stay here?

01:10.301 --> 01:12.259
But Steve and I never speak.

01:12.260 --> 01:14.391
We never communicate
during an investigation.

01:14.392 --> 01:15.670
Until the very end.

01:15.671 --> 01:17.537
Stop it.

01:17.538 --> 01:19.396
We uncover if it's
safe for you to stay...

01:19.397 --> 01:21.904
I want to know the truth. I
want to know what's happening.

01:21.905 --> 01:23.366
Or time to get out.

01:23.367 --> 01:28.047
I told you there were
ghosts in this house.

01:30.000 --> 01:36.074

01:50.867 --> 01:53.830
Amy and I work
independently of one another.

01:53.831 --> 01:55.832
I gather evidence, interview witnesses,

01:55.833 --> 01:58.801
and sort through the
history of each location,

01:58.802 --> 02:02.356
at the end, we come together
to reveal our findings.

02:02.357 --> 02:04.541
I'm headed to
Parkersburg, West Virginia.

02:04.542 --> 02:09.746
It's a small town on the Ohio River,
about an hour north of Charleston.

02:09.747 --> 02:12.215
I received a call from
a woman named Tisha.

02:12.216 --> 02:17.847
Her and her eight children are being
terrorized by something in their new home.

02:17.848 --> 02:21.005
She can't afford to leave, but
she is scared to stay there.

02:21.006 --> 02:25.446
I'm hoping Amy and I can help her out.

02:36.374 --> 02:38.974
Looking at the photos and
artwork throughout the house,

02:38.975 --> 02:42.694
it's clear to me that
a family lives here.

02:42.695 --> 02:45.708
So it's important that I take my
time to remove any personal evidence,

02:45.709 --> 02:50.149
that could influence
Amy during her walk.

03:17.329 --> 03:20.089
What's going on?

03:23.168 --> 03:27.548
I saw water and felt ice cold and wet.

03:30.980 --> 03:33.329
Well, there was, like,
someone who has drowned.

03:33.330 --> 03:37.710
Um, there's a male who's following us.

03:38.208 --> 03:42.528
Somehow these two incidents are related.

03:43.228 --> 03:47.944
He just keeps smiling, and the
smile is, like, really maniacal.

03:47.945 --> 03:51.485
He wants to kill me, and...

03:52.077 --> 03:55.137
He's waiting for me.

04:14.758 --> 04:16.603
- Tisha.
- Yes, Steve.

04:16.605 --> 04:19.120
So glad you're here.

04:19.120 --> 04:21.623
Well, Tisha, tell me why
you called Amy and I in.

04:21.624 --> 04:23.682
We are having some
activity in the house.

04:23.683 --> 04:27.639
My fiance and I... we moved
here about three years ago.

04:27.640 --> 04:30.353
We have eight children together.

04:30.354 --> 04:32.355
- We're a blended family.
- Okay.

04:32.356 --> 04:34.328
The kids are scared.

04:34.329 --> 04:37.887
Well, just last night,
our oldest was hysterical,

04:37.888 --> 04:41.130
and I spent a lot of
the night consoling her.

04:41.131 --> 04:45.211
We can't continue to live in fear.

04:45.462 --> 04:47.443
Tisha, what kind of things
are you experiencing here?

04:47.444 --> 04:51.492
We are seeing apparitions of people.

04:51.493 --> 04:54.771
Uh, some of us have
been physically touched.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.327
- Touched?
- Yes.

04:56.328 --> 04:57.560
All right, what about your fiance?

04:57.561 --> 05:01.519
He's extremely skeptical of anything
paranormal happening in the home.

05:01.520 --> 05:04.788
He certainly tries to
explain things away.

05:04.789 --> 05:07.483
Do you think that whatever's
here can be harmful to you guys?

05:07.484 --> 05:10.338
There's a certain uneasiness.

05:10.339 --> 05:13.262
I feel as though I'm being
watched in certain rooms,

05:13.263 --> 05:18.243
and I know that my
daughter feels the same way.

05:20.638 --> 05:22.558
Okay.

05:25.242 --> 05:29.022
Whoa. This is a very bad area.

05:39.622 --> 05:42.142
Are you okay?

05:42.174 --> 05:43.925
No, I don't like this area.

05:43.926 --> 05:46.830
I just feel like there's
a lot of people here.

05:46.831 --> 05:50.123
It's hard to make out what these
dead people are trying to say to me.

05:50.124 --> 05:56.024
There are so many of them, and
they're all screaming in pain.

05:56.173 --> 05:57.891
This is bad.

05:57.892 --> 06:00.352
Awful, awful.

06:11.321 --> 06:15.992
Had an instance not long ago when I
was at the top of the ladder painting,

06:15.993 --> 06:17.994
and I got a nice jolt.

06:17.995 --> 06:20.932
Um, not enough to
knock me off the ladder,

06:20.933 --> 06:26.038
but it was definitely just letting
me know that I was not alone.

06:26.039 --> 06:27.560
What did you do?

06:27.561 --> 06:30.035
I immediately got off the ladder
and said, "okay, if that"...

06:30.036 --> 06:35.256
"If you want me to stop
for the night, I'm done".

06:37.280 --> 06:40.184
There's a teenage boy here.

06:40.185 --> 06:43.036
And he's laughing, and he's a prankster.

06:43.037 --> 06:46.157
And he's probably 14.

06:50.127 --> 06:54.106
Sometimes maybe somebody's on a stool...

06:54.107 --> 06:58.067
Trying to put something up, and...

06:58.205 --> 07:00.410
Kind of move...

07:00.411 --> 07:01.968
The...

07:01.969 --> 07:03.949
Stool.

07:16.787 --> 07:21.195
I don't mean to be rude, but your walls
look like something exploded in here.

07:21.196 --> 07:25.895
Every time we try to start repairing
something, activity kicks up.

07:25.896 --> 07:27.461
Okay, what's going on in here?

07:27.462 --> 07:31.182
I was awakened by a whisper...

07:31.279 --> 07:33.355
In my ear.

07:33.356 --> 07:37.421
I sat up in bed, and I came face-to-face
with a woman standing in my doorway.

07:37.422 --> 07:40.543
She was looking directly
at me, right into my eyes.

07:40.544 --> 07:42.376
Can you describe her to me?

07:42.377 --> 07:45.746
She was a Caucasian female, thin.

07:45.747 --> 07:50.269
She had a long black dress with
a tall, white, frilly collar.

07:50.270 --> 07:52.674
She just looked as
though she needed help.

07:52.675 --> 07:56.153
- So she had a sad look on her face?
- Very sad.

07:56.154 --> 07:59.018
As soon as she dissipated from the room,

07:59.019 --> 08:02.464
I was up checking the children and
making sure everything was okay.

08:02.465 --> 08:04.470
How'd she disappear?
Did she just fade out?

08:04.471 --> 08:06.949
- She sort of sucked out of the room...
- Really?

08:06.950 --> 08:10.131
As if being sucked out by a vacuum.

08:10.132 --> 08:12.052
Okay.

08:14.690 --> 08:16.730
[Bleep]

08:20.550 --> 08:22.964
There's this lady.

08:22.965 --> 08:25.922
She's well-dressed. She's very small.

08:25.923 --> 08:28.317
She's very proper.

08:28.318 --> 08:31.738
She has a black dress on.

08:32.696 --> 08:36.416
She's being dealt a bad hand.

08:36.850 --> 08:40.970
Because her husband died,
and now she's nothing.

08:40.971 --> 08:45.024
Can she tell you about her husband?

08:45.025 --> 08:48.145
No. She starts crying.

08:56.241 --> 08:57.669
Okay, what's going on up here?

08:57.670 --> 09:00.733
When we're lying in bed at
night, and we hear sounds,

09:00.734 --> 09:06.614
they're usually coming from
this floor, and it sounds like...

09:08.555 --> 09:10.371
- Just like that.
- That noisy?

09:10.372 --> 09:13.169
- All night long.
- Wow.

09:13.170 --> 09:14.889
It's not the kids playing up here?

09:14.890 --> 09:17.650
No, the children are actually
very frightened of this floor.

09:17.651 --> 09:20.114
I've actually come up here
in the middle of the night,

09:20.115 --> 09:24.644
and everything is exactly where we
left it, um, and there's no one here.

09:24.645 --> 09:28.027
If I heard that, I'd reach
for my gun and come running up.

09:28.028 --> 09:31.754
You're seeing apparitions,
kids won't come up here,

09:31.755 --> 09:34.756
furniture sounds like it's
moving all night long...

09:34.757 --> 09:37.997
Why are you still here?

09:38.654 --> 09:42.331
Well, unfortunately, finances
don't permit us to move.

09:42.332 --> 09:43.613
Okay.

09:43.614 --> 09:45.835
Did you know the previous owners?

09:45.836 --> 09:49.740
I actually don't have any knowledge
of anyone who has lived in this home.

09:49.741 --> 09:52.140
Uh, we purchased it three years ago,

09:52.141 --> 09:56.040
and prior to that, it was
vacant for three years.

09:56.041 --> 09:57.957
Okay.

09:57.958 --> 10:03.858
I want to make it work. Right
now I'd like to have some answers.

10:13.046 --> 10:15.146
Mm. Mm.

10:19.448 --> 10:24.428
There's, like, ten men,
really just going crazy.

10:27.251 --> 10:30.261
This crowd of dead people are
following me everywhere I go,

10:30.262 --> 10:32.381
but they keep running into each other,

10:32.382 --> 10:34.884
like they're lost and
trapped in the darkness.

10:34.885 --> 10:37.731
Lots of [bleep] people.

10:37.732 --> 10:41.194
Oh, and there's something
wrong with their eyes.

10:41.195 --> 10:45.635
Um, I don't feel comfortable here. Um...

10:46.271 --> 10:49.691
Do you know what happened?

10:50.537 --> 10:53.117
Everybody dies.

11:05.687 --> 11:09.947
There's, like, lots of [bleep] people.

11:10.626 --> 11:14.766
Upstairs is just, uh, full of, uh...

11:14.848 --> 11:17.031
Crying and...

11:17.032 --> 11:19.192
People...

11:19.301 --> 11:22.661
That really don't belong.

11:33.552 --> 11:37.729
Uh, there's a dead little girl here.

11:37.730 --> 11:43.630
I mean, I guess she's, like,
10, and she, uh, is really thin.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.312
She says she can't hear anything.

11:46.313 --> 11:49.493
She has no equilibrium.

11:52.609 --> 11:56.477
So she stumbles into
things all the time.

11:56.478 --> 11:58.439
Where does this happen,
that she bumps into things?

11:58.440 --> 12:01.920
All over the [bleep] house.

12:09.596 --> 12:11.150
So, Torie, I was talking to mom,

12:11.151 --> 12:13.232
and she told me you had a
pretty bad night last night.

12:13.233 --> 12:15.392
- Yeah, it was bad.
- What happened?

12:15.393 --> 12:19.827
Um, I was laying in bed, and I kept
hearing furniture moving upstairs.

12:19.828 --> 12:23.104
So I called mom, and she
tried to calm me down,

12:23.105 --> 12:25.798
so I slept in the same
room as my grandpa.

12:25.799 --> 12:28.111
Okay. You look like
you're afraid to be here.

12:28.112 --> 12:32.373
Oh, yeah. I always keep my
light on, never close my door.

12:32.374 --> 12:35.638
- Okay, so you sleep with the light on?
- Yeah, and with kids in here.

12:35.639 --> 12:36.939
Your sisters and brothers?

12:36.940 --> 12:40.855
Yeah, I feel like something's
gonna come do something to me.

12:40.856 --> 12:42.284
We don't feel welcome.

12:42.285 --> 12:45.753
Your mother mentioned that she's felt
like she was always being watched.

12:45.754 --> 12:47.742
- Oh, yeah. Same here.
- You, too?

12:47.743 --> 12:50.024
- Yeah, all the time.
- Where do you feel that?

12:50.025 --> 12:53.256
Definitely the bathroom
on the second floor.

12:53.257 --> 12:56.395
Just when I take a shower, I
always gotta open the curtain,

12:56.396 --> 12:58.733
look out, because I feel
like someone's standing there.

12:58.734 --> 13:02.886
If I'm using the bathroom, I
feel like someone's staring at me.

13:02.887 --> 13:05.167
All right.

13:08.209 --> 13:10.898
He has been here for a long time.

13:10.899 --> 13:13.721
- Long time.
- Who?

13:13.722 --> 13:17.862
The boy from upstairs, the prankster.

13:18.219 --> 13:21.546
He watches everything. He
watches everything all the time.

13:21.547 --> 13:24.063
No privacy here, no, none, none.

13:24.064 --> 13:27.861
Like, he never had any,
so why should anybody else?

13:27.862 --> 13:33.082
And he said, "I don't care
if they feel violated".

13:39.071 --> 13:41.456
Definitely didn't have
bathrooms when he was here,

13:41.457 --> 13:45.117
but he enjoys them thoroughly.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.052
You know, Torie, I have a daughter
myself. She's a little bit older than you.

13:55.053 --> 13:59.002
I couldn't imagine her going
through this every night.

13:59.003 --> 14:00.251
It's gotta be tough on you.

14:00.252 --> 14:03.084
It is, and I worry about
the kids all the time.

14:03.085 --> 14:04.403
So on top of worrying about yourself,

14:04.404 --> 14:08.122
you've got younger siblings that
you're worrying about, right?

14:08.123 --> 14:11.568
- It's really not fair.
- It's not.

14:11.569 --> 14:14.569
Okay, just a minute.

14:18.134 --> 14:21.374
It's just really scary.

14:21.421 --> 14:23.641
For them.

14:25.640 --> 14:28.449
I just don't want them
to go through this.

14:28.450 --> 14:30.750
I don't. It's...

14:30.751 --> 14:33.931
It's hard. It's hard.

14:34.450 --> 14:36.613
I'm worried about my mom, too.

14:36.614 --> 14:39.794
I want it to be over.

14:49.288 --> 14:51.832
Jason, Tisha says you're a
skeptic. Is that accurate?

14:51.833 --> 14:56.195
I'm always trying to find the
logical, you know, explanations.

14:56.196 --> 14:58.636
But as time goes on and
things happen, you...

14:58.637 --> 15:01.153
You know, start to run
out of explanations.

15:01.154 --> 15:03.919
What are some of the things
that, uh, you've heard,

15:03.920 --> 15:07.295
or even seen for that matter,
that you try to explain logically?

15:07.296 --> 15:11.185
Well, we hear, um, some things
on the third floor, and, um,

15:11.186 --> 15:14.788
sounds like people walking or
something being moved upstairs.

15:14.789 --> 15:16.757
So what do you explain that to?

15:16.758 --> 15:19.349
Maybe it's birds, because,
you know, they're old windows,

15:19.350 --> 15:21.495
and sometimes they're
open when you go upstairs.

15:21.496 --> 15:25.232
Okay. Did any experience that
you had here change your mind?

15:25.233 --> 15:26.955
Yes.

15:26.956 --> 15:30.454
I was shaving in the
bathroom, and, um...

15:30.455 --> 15:34.041
My daughter usually comes up, you
know, to give me a hug, and I felt that.

15:34.042 --> 15:38.184
Then I looked around, and
there was no one there.

15:38.185 --> 15:39.191
What did you do?

15:39.192 --> 15:42.622
I went looking for my daughter, and,
of course, she was in the kitchen.

15:42.623 --> 15:46.154
Well, and I started asking, "did
you just come into the bathroom?"

15:46.155 --> 15:48.918
And they're like, "no, she's
been here the whole time".

15:48.919 --> 15:51.124
Is that the defining moment
that changed your attitude?

15:51.125 --> 15:53.945
- Oh, yes.
- Okay.

15:58.733 --> 16:01.733
This prankster kid...

16:02.016 --> 16:06.002
- Does he do stuff to the living here?
- Yes.

16:06.003 --> 16:08.642
What sort of things?

16:08.643 --> 16:11.645
He watches them always.

16:11.646 --> 16:13.681
Follows them.

16:13.682 --> 16:16.149
Breathes on them.

16:16.150 --> 16:22.050
Likes to walk around right behind them,
like, walking up right behind them.

16:23.956 --> 16:26.485
He likes to surprise them.

16:26.486 --> 16:29.246
Sometimes, like...

16:29.260 --> 16:33.160
Get in there and asphyxiate them.

16:48.572 --> 16:51.764
So far, all I've got is
a lot of witness testimony

16:51.765 --> 16:54.212
about what's going on in Tisha's house.

16:54.213 --> 16:57.033
But I need facts.

16:58.820 --> 17:02.234
Going through the library's archives,
I find an article about a young couple

17:02.235 --> 17:07.233
that died when two massive water
tanks collapsed and flooded the town.

17:07.233 --> 17:11.775
Turns out, this disaster happened
directly behind Tisha's house.

17:11.776 --> 17:15.642
So I'm going to meet with a local author
who's writing a book on the tragedy.

17:15.643 --> 17:20.443
To see if he can fill
me in on the details.

17:26.048 --> 17:28.201
Yes, in 1885,

17:28.202 --> 17:32.966
the city of Parkersburg built two
large water tanks, on Quincy Hill.

17:32.967 --> 17:38.334
And then on march 19, 1909, about
25 years after they were built.

17:38.335 --> 17:42.758
The south tank ruptured, and the force of
the water caused the north tank to rupture.

17:42.759 --> 17:48.579
2 million gallons of water just
instantly flooded Parkersburg.

17:49.091 --> 17:51.655
And this happened literally right
near the house I'm investigating.

17:51.656 --> 17:53.036
Yeah.

17:53.037 --> 17:55.906
- Which is the site we're at right now.
- Okay.

17:55.907 --> 17:59.195
They call it the
Parkersburg flood of 1909.

17:59.196 --> 18:00.650
How high was the water?

18:00.651 --> 18:04.857
A lot of the houses had 5 to 6
feet of water inside of them...

18:04.858 --> 18:08.194
And there were a lot of
homes in the surrounding area

18:08.195 --> 18:12.475
that were ripped off their foundations
and thrown into the streets below.

18:12.476 --> 18:15.652
You know, Jeff, hearing this story,
and 2 million gallons of water,

18:15.653 --> 18:18.966
I find it hard to believe that only
two people got killed in this accident.

18:18.967 --> 18:23.992
Well, actually, Steve,
there was another that night.

18:23.993 --> 18:29.813
An invalid woman, uh, was pinned
underneath a lot of rubble.

18:32.314 --> 18:33.979
How old was she?

18:33.980 --> 18:35.935
About 70 years old.

18:35.936 --> 18:39.018
Okay, so she was basically
crushed from the accident.

18:39.019 --> 18:41.419
Pretty much.

18:46.128 --> 18:48.582
I'm, like, seeing the...

18:48.583 --> 18:52.603
I'm, like, seeing the water again.

18:52.660 --> 18:56.004
There's people walking through here.

18:56.005 --> 18:57.626
There's women.

18:57.627 --> 19:00.807
The women are all wet.

19:01.536 --> 19:04.896
They're all just walking.

19:08.054 --> 19:11.846
I don't know, they're all, like,
in nightclothes and [bleep].

19:11.847 --> 19:16.107
Like, whatever went down was at night.

19:19.767 --> 19:22.363
So now a young couple gets killed...

19:22.364 --> 19:23.344
Yes.

19:23.345 --> 19:26.823
Walter Wigal and his
wife Flora Toncray Wigal,

19:26.824 --> 19:29.118
rented a little home on
the side of Quincy Hill...

19:29.119 --> 19:29.932
Okay.

19:29.933 --> 19:32.005
And when the water tanks ruptured,

19:32.006 --> 19:35.816
their house was swept down
into, uh, Avery Street.

19:35.817 --> 19:37.819
Were their bodies ever found?

19:37.820 --> 19:42.265
A few hours later,
their bodies were found.

19:42.266 --> 19:47.792
The two little X's there signify
where their bodies were located.

19:47.793 --> 19:49.997
Wow, so it just wiped
the whole house out.

19:49.998 --> 19:51.833
Right off its foundation.

19:51.834 --> 19:56.743
Some of the eyewitnesses say that their
hands and arms were over their mouths,

19:56.744 --> 20:00.708
as if they were trying to
get another breath of air.

20:00.709 --> 20:02.569
Wow.

20:03.135 --> 20:04.433
Who built the towers?

20:04.434 --> 20:08.453
The land that you're investigating
was owned by the Jackson family,

20:08.454 --> 20:11.430
and they were one of the
principle shareholders,

20:11.431 --> 20:15.211
of the original waterworks here.

20:25.444 --> 20:28.340
Shaking and falling.

20:28.341 --> 20:30.593
Like, oh, [bleep].

20:30.594 --> 20:32.514
Down.

20:33.156 --> 20:35.991
Cover it up. Cover it up, shh.

20:35.992 --> 20:38.360
Panic. Whoa.

20:38.361 --> 20:42.081
Wasn't expecting that, no, no.

20:43.655 --> 20:46.055
Oh, no, no.

20:46.105 --> 20:49.165
This was an accident.

20:49.395 --> 20:52.776
I'm seeing a man tumbling
down and falling to his death.

20:52.777 --> 20:58.371
Everything's going dark around
him, and he's struggling to breathe.

20:58.372 --> 21:01.381
Oh, [bleep] it hurts. Oh.

21:01.382 --> 21:02.426
Are you okay?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.527
Oh. Ah!

21:05.474 --> 21:08.615
Now I just felt like my...

21:08.616 --> 21:10.855
Like what?

21:10.856 --> 21:13.856
Like an impact here.

21:16.857 --> 21:20.697
God, his body's, like, spasming.

21:20.722 --> 21:22.376
Like...

21:22.377 --> 21:23.711
This man has entered my body,

21:23.712 --> 21:27.336
and I'm experiencing all of
the pain he had to endure.

21:27.337 --> 21:29.377
[Bleep]

21:31.975 --> 21:35.182
I gotta get him out. I gotta...

21:35.183 --> 21:37.980
I gotta get him out of me.

21:37.981 --> 21:43.741
He just wants everybody to
know that he was [bleep] killed.

21:48.578 --> 21:50.877
A local author told me
about the Jackson family

21:50.878 --> 21:53.462
who owned Tisha's
property back in the 1800s.

21:53.463 --> 21:55.826
They're the same family
that built the water towers

21:55.827 --> 21:58.601
that collapsed and killed three people.

21:58.602 --> 22:04.302
I'm hoping a local historian
can tell me more about them.

22:07.176 --> 22:10.444
I came across the name of
a General John Jay Jackson.

22:10.445 --> 22:12.125
I understand you know
a lot about this guy.

22:12.126 --> 22:14.650
Yes. Here is a photo of the General.

22:14.651 --> 22:17.692
He came to Parkersburg in 1820,

22:17.693 --> 22:22.016
and quickly established himself
as a very influential person.

22:22.017 --> 22:25.168
He was a Founding Father
of the city of Parkersburg.

22:25.169 --> 22:27.151
So how did he make a living?

22:27.152 --> 22:31.644
In the 1840s, he purchased
a Parkersburg newspaper.

22:31.645 --> 22:33.425
And then soon thereafter,

22:33.426 --> 22:36.302
oil was discovered at an
area called Burning Springs.

22:36.303 --> 22:42.203
And, uh, Mr. Jackson, he became
involved in the oil industry in the area.

22:42.302 --> 22:45.333
Oh, okay. What kind of
a businessman was he?

22:45.334 --> 22:50.152
His oil involvement, any time
you're buying land and speculating.

22:50.153 --> 22:53.245
There's, uh, often controversy.

22:53.246 --> 22:56.796
And this certainly may have been
the case involving General Jackson.

22:56.797 --> 22:58.717
Okay.

23:01.553 --> 23:06.252
So now I'm seeing this guy, and he's
just wearing a long black duster.

23:06.253 --> 23:10.333
I mean, he was here from way back.

23:11.546 --> 23:13.526
1860s.

23:14.433 --> 23:17.263
He wants to hide where...
wherever he came from.

23:17.264 --> 23:19.537
But he came from back east.

23:19.538 --> 23:22.739
And he was a prominent person.

23:22.740 --> 23:24.622
He...

23:24.623 --> 23:26.147
Was...

23:26.148 --> 23:30.168
Instrumental in this town's growth.

23:32.784 --> 23:36.414
Now what about family? Did he
have wife, kids? What's the story?

23:36.415 --> 23:42.160
He had a wife, actually had several kids,
total of 11 kids, six with his first wife.

23:42.161 --> 23:44.761
Uh, she passed away in the 1840s.

23:44.762 --> 23:48.732
He married Jane, had five
more children with her.

23:48.733 --> 23:51.861
And she outlived him by nearly 20 years.

23:51.862 --> 23:54.482
So, Bob, what do you know
about Jane the second wife?

23:54.483 --> 23:59.343
Legend has it that when
his son John Jay, Jr.

23:59.840 --> 24:04.642
Had been home from school, that he had
fallen in love with a girl in Parkersburg.

24:04.643 --> 24:08.147
Named Jane, whom he
planned to marry himself.

24:08.148 --> 24:12.590
However, this happened to be the
same Jane that his father married.

24:12.591 --> 24:15.222
So he married the Jane that the
son was looking to hook up with?

24:15.223 --> 24:17.272
Yes, she definitely married up.

24:17.273 --> 24:21.023
She, uh, was probably
very happy to become...

24:21.024 --> 24:23.551
Into the... one of the
elite of Parkersburg.

24:23.552 --> 24:25.472
Okay.

24:29.236 --> 24:32.955
Now I'm just seeing
this lady... the husband.

24:32.956 --> 24:36.002
She was just married.
That made her happy.

24:36.003 --> 24:39.354
She was then brought up
a little bit or something.

24:39.355 --> 24:42.415
And people were nicer to her.

24:42.416 --> 24:45.777
And... than they had
ever been in her life.

24:45.778 --> 24:49.970
But then it was back
to it not being good.

24:49.971 --> 24:52.398
And her being, uh...

24:52.399 --> 24:55.699
Just miserable and empty.

24:57.893 --> 24:59.437
Um...

24:59.438 --> 25:02.378
And worthless again.

25:02.556 --> 25:06.996
- Why did that happen?
- Because he died.

25:09.855 --> 25:13.351
General Jackson had a
great military career.

25:13.352 --> 25:17.556
At the age of 15, he was
appointed to West Point.

25:17.557 --> 25:20.368
And served in the Seminole Wars.

25:20.369 --> 25:24.604
Okay, so by the time The Civil War came
around, he would've been too old to serve.

25:24.605 --> 25:29.935
Yes. But he allowed a field
hospital to be built on his property.

25:29.936 --> 25:30.938
Okay.

25:30.939 --> 25:34.549
And the hill behind it was
used for military purposes,

25:34.550 --> 25:38.750
in the fact that troops camped there.

25:41.693 --> 25:44.511
Between the water tank
disaster and The Civil War,

25:44.512 --> 25:47.858
the land Tisha's house sits on
has tragedy written all over it,

25:47.859 --> 25:50.338
and it's all tied to General Jackson.

25:50.339 --> 25:52.420
So I'm meeting with a local war expert

25:52.421 --> 25:57.941
to see what other information
I can find out about him.

26:05.658 --> 26:09.903
Picture, if you will, this entire
bottom being covered with federal troops,

26:09.904 --> 26:14.226
artillery pieces, cavalry, infantry
moving back and forth across the streets.

26:14.227 --> 26:16.050
That was all General Jackson's property?

26:16.051 --> 26:20.172
Yeah. The entire hill, that
belonged to General John Jay Jackson.

26:20.173 --> 26:23.478
Why would General Jackson
allow troops to use his land?

26:23.479 --> 26:25.448
Being a pro Unionist,

26:25.449 --> 26:28.481
he thought that he would do
everything he could for his country.

26:28.482 --> 26:30.383
I have a photograph right here.

26:30.384 --> 26:33.666
This is a camp that was stationed
right below the hillside there.

26:33.667 --> 26:37.514
It was used as a Tent
City for Federal Soldiers

26:37.515 --> 26:39.596
during The Civil War in
the early part of the days,

26:39.597 --> 26:45.497
and then it was later used as a
quarantine area for Smallpox victims.

26:48.736 --> 26:52.527
There's a lot of dead
people in this area.

26:52.528 --> 26:55.108
A lot of men.

26:57.001 --> 26:59.988
They look, uh, military.

26:59.989 --> 27:01.278
So, like, when?

27:01.279 --> 27:04.399
Uh, [bleep] Civil War.

27:06.164 --> 27:09.106
There's something weird with their eyes.

27:09.107 --> 27:12.827
They're not looking very good.

27:20.158 --> 27:23.004
During my walk, I had
encountered several dead people,

27:23.005 --> 27:27.031
but I decided to have a sketch artist
draw the evil man who wanted to kill me.

27:27.032 --> 27:29.229
He is very tall.

27:29.230 --> 27:34.270
And he is like a skeleton
with a layer of skin.

27:36.884 --> 27:40.665
He's wearing a very
thick leather jacket.

27:40.666 --> 27:43.277
When he smiles, does he show his teeth?

27:43.278 --> 27:45.798
- Yes.
- Okay.

27:50.831 --> 27:53.891
Is this who you saw?

27:55.279 --> 27:57.139
Yes.

28:17.063 --> 28:20.345
After completing our
investigations separately,

28:20.346 --> 28:24.244
Amy and I reveal our findings
together for the first time.

28:24.245 --> 28:27.212
Amy, this is Tisha and Jason.
They're engaged to be married.

28:27.213 --> 28:31.517
Together they have eight children, but
ever since they moved into the house,

28:31.518 --> 28:33.780
they've been going through
some terrifying things.

28:33.781 --> 28:38.071
Torie especially, Torie's
their oldest, she's 17.

28:38.072 --> 28:39.606
She doesn't sleep at night.

28:39.607 --> 28:42.119
She also has her siblings
she's worried about because,

28:42.120 --> 28:44.190
she doesn't want them to go through
what she's going through now,

28:44.191 --> 28:46.437
because they're a lot younger than her.

28:46.438 --> 28:48.542
Now we'll get to hear about Amy's walk,

28:48.543 --> 28:53.583
and, uh, what she encountered
while she was here.

28:54.735 --> 28:57.798
When I first came onto the property...

28:57.799 --> 29:01.159
I felt wet and ice cold.

29:01.369 --> 29:07.269
I saw that somebody had drowned,
um, seeing the pools of water.

29:08.378 --> 29:13.948
At the end of my walk, I saw all of
these women, and they were soaking wet,

29:13.949 --> 29:16.052
and they were in their nightclothes.

29:16.053 --> 29:18.148
That sounds a lot like
the water tank disaster

29:18.149 --> 29:21.530
that happened here in 1909, in March.

29:21.531 --> 29:26.213
Two 1-million gallon tanks of water
that were literally 100 yards from here,

29:26.214 --> 29:31.554
ruptured and sent a flash
flood into this whole area.

29:31.604 --> 29:35.840
It literally took houses right off
their foundations and ripped 'em out.

29:35.841 --> 29:41.741
Uh, three people died from it,
and it caused a lot of devastation.

29:43.493 --> 29:44.650
What else did you see?

29:44.651 --> 29:49.588
So I was in the hallway,
and there was this man.

29:49.589 --> 29:54.626
And I felt, like, this
blow to my abdominal area.

29:54.627 --> 29:58.863
I felt like I was shaking
and falling, falling down.

29:58.864 --> 30:03.664
Then I heard, uh, "down,
cover up, cover up".

30:04.196 --> 30:08.036
God, his body's, like, spasming.

30:08.262 --> 30:11.142
Panic. Oh, no, no.

30:11.962 --> 30:13.998
This was an accident.

30:13.999 --> 30:16.961
I don't know if it plays into
what you're talking about.

30:16.962 --> 30:20.022
These are the Wigals.

30:20.111 --> 30:24.423
This is a young couple that had a
cottage right behind your house here.

30:24.424 --> 30:29.164
I mean, they didn't
even know what hit 'em.

30:29.798 --> 30:31.814
- You say "cover up"?
- Yeah.

30:31.815 --> 30:36.315
- This is their home afterwards.
- Oh, my.

30:40.089 --> 30:42.166
They found them with
their mouths covered,

30:42.167 --> 30:47.175
their hands covering their mouth as
if to stop the water from going in.

30:47.176 --> 30:49.050
They must have suffered for a while.

30:49.051 --> 30:52.284
When I first moved here, I used to
have nightmares that I was drowning.

30:52.285 --> 30:54.805
Wow. Oh, wow.

30:57.257 --> 30:59.720
All right, so anything else?

30:59.721 --> 31:03.629
Okay, so there's two
people on the second floor.

31:03.630 --> 31:07.353
One is a younger girl, about 10.

31:07.354 --> 31:10.925
One is a younger male, about 14.

31:10.926 --> 31:12.749
The younger girl...

31:12.750 --> 31:16.074
Um, has an equilibrium issue.

31:16.075 --> 31:19.207
So she tends to stumble around a lot.

31:19.208 --> 31:23.108
And accidentally bang into things.

31:24.183 --> 31:26.897
The other person...

31:26.898 --> 31:29.965
He is rather malicious.

31:29.966 --> 31:34.706
And he likes to really
mess with the living.

31:34.897 --> 31:38.387
He likes to jump on them in bed.

31:38.388 --> 31:42.160
And likes to make them feel helpless.

31:42.161 --> 31:44.803
He also likes the bathroom a lot.

31:44.804 --> 31:49.064
- Oh, God.
- He likes to be in there.

31:50.675 --> 31:53.975
He watches all the time.

32:03.261 --> 32:06.325
This is... she's got a bad thing
going on upstairs in the bathroom.

32:06.326 --> 32:10.286
She feels like she's being
watched, right, honey?

32:10.287 --> 32:13.227
Yeah. All the time.

32:14.383 --> 32:16.543
Oh, God.

32:20.198 --> 32:22.358
Oh, God.

32:24.423 --> 32:27.412
One other thing that he'll attempt to
do, like, if you're standing on a stool

32:27.413 --> 32:31.900
or a chair or something, he'll try to
shake it to make you feel, like, dizzy.

32:31.901 --> 32:35.075
I've been doing a lot of
painting in the last few weeks,

32:35.076 --> 32:40.176
and I was on a tall
ladder and got a good jilt.

32:41.694 --> 32:44.258
I have a tendency to just say, okay,

32:44.259 --> 32:47.182
if you don't want me to do
this right now, I'll leave.

32:47.183 --> 32:49.703
So I stopped.

32:50.219 --> 32:56.119
He doesn't do it because he wants you
to stop, he wants to do it to hurt you.

32:57.624 --> 33:01.119
The other person, he
does come into this house,

33:01.120 --> 33:05.319
and he is the man in the black coat.

33:05.320 --> 33:08.740
And he wanted to kill me.

33:09.463 --> 33:12.565
He's from the 1860s or '70s.

33:12.566 --> 33:18.055
He was a very prominent person,
um, and he was very instrumental

33:18.056 --> 33:20.876
in creating this town.

33:20.877 --> 33:23.930
That sounds just like John Jay Jackson.

33:23.931 --> 33:27.217
He owned the property
that your house sits on.

33:27.218 --> 33:29.936
He owned this whole hill.

33:29.937 --> 33:30.948
Whoa.

33:30.949 --> 33:35.346
He was one of the Founding
Fathers, actually, of Parkersburg.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.647
This is a photo of him.

33:40.670 --> 33:43.171
He died in 1877.

33:43.172 --> 33:45.941
Went to West Point at a very young age.

33:45.942 --> 33:50.142
He was the upper crust of this town.

33:50.338 --> 33:55.517
Matter of fact, the Jackson family money
initially built the water tank towers.

33:55.518 --> 33:57.602
Which exploded.

33:57.603 --> 34:00.308
Do you think the apparition
you saw is General Jackson?

34:00.309 --> 34:03.250
Yes, I... yes, I do.

34:03.251 --> 34:06.269
But he also showed me
another side of himself.

34:06.270 --> 34:10.170
Which was, uh, very scary to me.

34:11.233 --> 34:16.047
He was trying to kind of show
me him in his youth, but, like,

34:16.049 --> 34:19.491
in a really dark, sinister way.

34:19.492 --> 34:25.132
I sketched him that way,
because it really was disturbing.

34:34.581 --> 34:38.313
I mean, what the hell is this?

34:38.315 --> 34:41.195
Take a look, guys.

35:07.727 --> 35:11.062
I mean, what the hell is this?

35:11.063 --> 35:13.621
Take a look, guys.

35:13.622 --> 35:15.422
Oh.

35:15.701 --> 35:19.361
- He has no pupils.
- I know.

35:38.758 --> 35:41.260
Sometimes when I go to the third floor,

35:41.261 --> 35:45.030
I feel like there's a male presence
there that doesn't want me there.

35:45.031 --> 35:47.065
He's all over the place, yeah.

35:47.066 --> 35:49.661
Without a doubt, he could be
up there at any given time.

35:49.662 --> 35:53.521
Like, he moves around,
like, outside the house.

35:53.522 --> 35:59.422
And I didn't like him, he kind of
creeped me out, like, pretty bad.

36:05.423 --> 36:07.424
Okay, so, uh, what else did you see?

36:07.425 --> 36:10.548
I met a woman downstairs...

36:10.549 --> 36:13.654
Who was very well-dressed.

36:13.655 --> 36:16.655
She was very proper.

36:16.929 --> 36:19.133
She wasn't a very attractive woman.

36:19.134 --> 36:24.346
And, uh, she was married
to the man in the dark coat.

36:24.347 --> 36:29.541
But then when he died, she
felt like she was an outcast.

36:29.542 --> 36:32.261
Tell Amy about the apparition you saw.

36:32.262 --> 36:36.146
I was awakened when I
heard a whisper in my ear.

36:36.147 --> 36:39.832
I sat straight up in bed,
and there was this woman.

36:39.833 --> 36:45.733
And she was very thin, older, gray
hair pulled up in a bun, very proper.

36:46.098 --> 36:49.527
It sounds a lot like you're talking
about General Jackson's second wife Jane.

36:49.528 --> 36:54.140
You know, town legend says that
Jane was supposed to marry his son,

36:54.141 --> 36:57.519
but that the father stole her from him.

36:57.520 --> 37:01.960
Unfortunately, nobody
has a photo of her.

37:05.003 --> 37:08.088
You encountered a lot
so far, anything else?

37:08.089 --> 37:10.748
There were a lot of dead here.

37:10.749 --> 37:13.109
Out in the back, I saw soldiers.

37:13.110 --> 37:17.054
And the interesting thing
about a lot of them...

37:17.055 --> 37:19.935
They couldn't see.

37:20.605 --> 37:22.999
They all had issues with their eyes.

37:23.000 --> 37:28.016
During The Civil War, General Jackson
had the Union Army utilize this property

37:28.017 --> 37:30.335
as a campsite for the troops.

37:30.336 --> 37:32.136
Oh.

37:32.422 --> 37:34.020
Actually, I got a photo of it.

37:34.021 --> 37:37.346
They called it Tent City, and
it housed probably anywhere from

37:37.347 --> 37:40.969
up to 1,000 soldiers at any given
time during the 4-year period.

37:40.970 --> 37:44.449
But they had a quarantine
area for Smallpox.

37:44.450 --> 37:47.278
And did you know that Smallpox...
and I just learned this...

37:47.279 --> 37:48.633
You can go blind from it.

37:48.634 --> 37:51.448
- Oh.
- But a lot of those guys died here.

37:51.449 --> 37:53.958
Okay, that makes sense then.

37:53.959 --> 37:55.891
That makes sense, what you saw, now?

37:55.892 --> 37:59.753
Um, not with the eyes,
for what I'm seeing,

37:59.754 --> 38:02.099
but it makes sense for
what I saw in the backyard.

38:02.100 --> 38:05.635
Okay, so the blindness you don't
think is attributed to the Smallpox?

38:05.636 --> 38:06.636
No.

38:06.637 --> 38:08.631
Okay, where do you think it's from?

38:08.632 --> 38:12.232
I think it's from this guy.

38:14.680 --> 38:19.199
I saw all of these dead people
rush up to, like, the windows,

38:19.200 --> 38:22.897
and they were, like, banging
and trying to get out.

38:22.898 --> 38:25.856
And that's when I knew
that they were trapped.

38:25.857 --> 38:28.848
And then I thought about
the eyes and that maybe he's

38:28.849 --> 38:32.018
blinding them so they
can't really see the exits.

38:32.019 --> 38:37.919
I have never had as many eye problems
as I have had in the past three years.

38:38.089 --> 38:40.161
And right now I have trouble seeing.

38:40.162 --> 38:44.701
Can that happen to me as a result
of what happened in the past?

38:44.702 --> 38:49.442
Well, he could be
trying to do that to you.

38:49.615 --> 38:52.507
Certain entities can
become so powerful in death

38:52.508 --> 38:54.658
that they are able to
harm not only the dead,

38:54.659 --> 38:59.519
but in some extreme
cases, the living as well.

39:00.163 --> 39:02.731
So... why... but why
does he want 'em to stay?

39:02.732 --> 39:04.617
He's a collector.

39:04.618 --> 39:09.264
I feel like with his life, all of
the collecting he did then of, like,

39:09.265 --> 39:11.546
maybe property and
money and all of this...

39:11.547 --> 39:16.541
The only thing in death that
you can really collect are souls.

39:16.542 --> 39:20.949
He and the little boy
are one in the same.

39:20.950 --> 39:25.270
He has this part of himself
that's this little boy

39:25.271 --> 39:30.488
that can do all these horrible things,
keep an eye on everything constantly,

39:30.489 --> 39:35.649
while his other self is
literally roaming the town.

39:43.435 --> 39:46.530
I know this is a lot of
information to digest in one night,

39:46.531 --> 39:48.688
uh, but the most pressing question...

39:48.689 --> 39:51.030
Is it safe for your family to be here.

39:51.031 --> 39:54.967
And for Torie and the other kids to
grow up and have a normal childhood?

39:54.968 --> 40:00.868
Uh, I can't answer that, so for
that, I'm gonna turn it over to Amy.

40:06.091 --> 40:07.858
So there's definitely good news here.

40:07.859 --> 40:12.297
This is going to be
relatively easy to deal with.

40:12.298 --> 40:17.168
You have so much residual
energy here, it's ridiculous.

40:17.169 --> 40:21.005
So the first thing to do is a cleansing.

40:21.006 --> 40:23.345
- Okay.
- You get Sage, and...

40:23.346 --> 40:26.819
Light the Sage, and so you're
gonna go, like, every window,

40:26.820 --> 40:30.862
every doorway, everything
that could be an entrance.

40:30.863 --> 40:32.983
And you let it burn there.

40:32.984 --> 40:34.867
Why... why Sage, though?

40:34.868 --> 40:39.728
It is thought to be a
natural cleansing agent.

40:40.173 --> 40:43.194
To disperse residual energy.

40:43.195 --> 40:45.376
The other thing is in each room,

40:45.377 --> 40:48.574
you're gonna take salt, and just
filling up your palm with it,

40:48.575 --> 40:54.026
taking a little sprinkle, throwing
it in the four corners of each room.

40:54.027 --> 40:56.474
They're gonna all be attracted to this.

40:56.475 --> 41:02.375
Then what you're going to do is throw
it out the front door, and that's it.

41:02.589 --> 41:05.748
The dead people at this location
will be drawn to the salt.

41:05.749 --> 41:08.953
When Tisha throws it outside,
this will release them.

41:08.954 --> 41:12.357
There's a lot of people
here who want to leave.

41:12.358 --> 41:17.398
The air will be so much
better, so much lighter.

41:19.197 --> 41:22.212
I've always felt like there was
something here that needed my help.

41:22.213 --> 41:26.833
And I didn't know how
to help them, so...

41:27.706 --> 41:30.231
But promise me you guys
are gonna do what she says.

41:30.232 --> 41:32.028
Absolutely.

41:32.029 --> 41:35.869
- Probably tomorrow.
- Good, good.

41:36.216 --> 41:39.751
There are several dead
people inhabiting this house.

41:39.752 --> 41:44.255
But I think only the man in the
long black coat presents any danger.

41:44.256 --> 41:48.205
And I believe as long as Tisha
and her family follow my advice,

41:48.206 --> 41:51.686
everyone should remain safe.
