WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.047
Previously...

00:03.120 --> 00:06.920
You live in a brothel?
Is it because you're such a good customer?

00:07.000 --> 00:08.047
Monsieur Malcolm.

00:08.119 --> 00:09.121
Madame Jeanne.

00:09.200 --> 00:10.440
She keeps a room for me

00:10.520 --> 00:12.522
'cause I'm often abroad,
attending to business.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.601
Ian Murray, mistress.

00:13.680 --> 00:15.409
Are you Jenny and Ian Murray's son?

00:15.480 --> 00:16.481
Aye.

00:16.560 --> 00:18.403
I'm your aunt. Claire.

00:18.480 --> 00:22.610
What exactly is the nature
of your work with my husband?

00:22.680 --> 00:26.321
That would be
a better question for Mr Malcolm.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.489
Do you want to tell me
what it is that you do?

00:28.560 --> 00:30.403
I am a printer.

00:30.480 --> 00:33.768
Printing seditious pamphlets
is not all that profitable.

00:33.840 --> 00:35.171
What else have you been doing?

00:35.240 --> 00:37.049
A wee bit of smuggling on the side.

00:37.120 --> 00:39.282
- Smuggling what?
- Whisky.

00:40.920 --> 00:43.207
Seems a trifle light, Mr Malcolm.

00:44.440 --> 00:46.568
Who the hell are you? Get out, now...

00:48.040 --> 00:50.566
Sing me a song

00:50.640 --> 00:53.371
Of a lass that is gone

00:53.640 --> 00:56.291
Say, could that lass

00:56.360 --> 00:58.328
Be I?

00:59.280 --> 01:01.328
Merry of soul

01:01.400 --> 01:04.370
She sailed on a day

01:04.440 --> 01:06.522
Over the sea

01:06.600 --> 01:08.921
To Skye

01:09.720 --> 01:12.041
Billow and breeze

01:12.120 --> 01:14.521
Islands and seas

01:14.880 --> 01:19.408
Mountains of rain and sun

01:20.160 --> 01:22.162
All that was good

01:22.640 --> 01:24.529
All that was fair

01:25.320 --> 01:27.448
All that was me

01:27.520 --> 01:29.966
Is gone

01:30.440 --> 01:32.727
Sing me a song

01:32.800 --> 01:35.644
Of a lass that is gone

01:35.720 --> 01:37.529
Say, could that lass

01:38.160 --> 01:39.844
Be I?

01:40.880 --> 01:43.121
Merry of soul

01:43.200 --> 01:46.044
She sailed on a day

01:46.120 --> 01:49.647
Over the sea

01:50.040 --> 01:55.331
To Skye

02:26.160 --> 02:28.288
- You come any closer, I'll...
- You'll what?

02:39.480 --> 02:42.006
Now I'm not even gonna bed you.
I'm just gonna kill you.

03:04.800 --> 03:05.881
Sassenach.

03:09.960 --> 03:11.291
What the devil happened?

03:25.520 --> 03:26.601
Sassenach.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.651
I was downstairs, and I came back.

03:39.320 --> 03:41.368
I found him rummaging through your things.

03:43.320 --> 03:45.482
He grabbed me. I fought him off, but...

03:49.600 --> 03:50.806
It all happened so quickly.

03:56.680 --> 03:58.125
He's breathing!

03:58.480 --> 03:59.481
Sassenach.

04:03.120 --> 04:04.531
Sassenach, what are you thinking?

04:04.640 --> 04:06.369
I can't let him suffer.
I have to do something.

04:06.440 --> 04:07.726
Why? He attacked you.

04:08.120 --> 04:09.451
Because I'm a doctor.

04:17.040 --> 04:20.202
An epidural haematoma.
I'm going to have to relieve the swelling.

04:22.440 --> 04:23.441
Aye?

04:25.160 --> 04:26.207
Who is it?

04:26.280 --> 04:27.725
Me, Milord. I'm with Madame Jeanne.

04:27.800 --> 04:30.531
Some of the ladies said
they heard a struggle in your bed chamber.

04:36.640 --> 04:38.165
She was defending herself.

04:39.600 --> 04:40.965
Please, help me get him on the bed.

04:42.160 --> 04:44.162
- Who is he?
- I don't know.

04:44.560 --> 04:47.086
Sassenach... Let God take him.

04:47.640 --> 04:49.642
I have to try and save him, Jamie.

04:50.160 --> 04:51.446
You understand?

04:54.560 --> 04:55.561
Please.

05:00.160 --> 05:01.844
- You have some whisky?
- Aye.

05:02.560 --> 05:03.561
Over there.

05:18.280 --> 05:21.602
Ye said he was searching
for something in the room.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.681
Yes, your ledgers.

05:26.440 --> 05:28.044
John Barton.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.361
An excise man.

05:32.320 --> 05:33.765
This is very bad, Milord.

05:34.720 --> 05:35.721
Aye.

05:35.960 --> 05:39.123
It seems Sir Percival is of the mind
I'm not keeping to our agreement.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.081
What agreement?

05:41.480 --> 05:44.051
He turns a blind eye
lo the sale of my illegal liquor

05:44.120 --> 05:46.646
in exchange
for a large portion of the profit.

05:46.720 --> 05:50.167
But our business pursuits
have expanded beyond Edinburgh,

05:50.240 --> 05:52.129
and I havena apprised him of the matter.

05:52.600 --> 05:55.649
You think he has word we've been trading
as far as Dundee and Arbroath?

05:55.720 --> 05:57.484
Aye. Yeah, maybe.

05:58.120 --> 06:00.441
Just yesterday, he attempted
to extort more money from me.

06:00.800 --> 06:05.442
He must have employed this man to find out
where I've stowed my hidden casks.

06:05.520 --> 06:07.409
So he's a crooked agent
of the Crown, then.

06:07.480 --> 06:10.131
Aye. When this man doesna return,

06:10.200 --> 06:12.202
Sir Percival will come round
looking for him.

06:12.280 --> 06:14.726
That is quite a problem, Monsieur Malcolm,

06:15.160 --> 06:17.686
considering the casks
Sir Percival is searching for

06:17.760 --> 06:19.728
are hidden in my basement.

06:21.640 --> 06:22.846
Well, not for long.

06:23.760 --> 06:26.161
No harm will befall you on my account.
You have my word.

06:27.760 --> 06:30.081
Allow me to send one
of my more discreet girls

06:30.840 --> 06:33.320
to put everything in order right away.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.601
Please.

06:36.680 --> 06:39.081
Ask her for some hot water and a basin,

06:39.160 --> 06:41.447
and I'll need some surgical implements.

06:41.520 --> 06:44.490
A trephine. Send her
to the barber surgeon. He'll have one.

06:44.560 --> 06:47.689
- A what?
Whatever for?

06:48.160 --> 06:50.242
A drill to bore a hole in his skull.

06:52.040 --> 06:55.487
I will see what I can do...
Madame Malcolm.

06:55.840 --> 06:56.841
Thank you.

06:58.840 --> 07:01.684
Gather the lads.
I'll inform them of events shortly.

07:01.760 --> 07:02.761
Aye.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.411
I still have some time.

07:07.280 --> 07:10.523
I'll need to go to the apothecary,
get some laudanum and things.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.685
Will you stay with him until I come back,
in case he wakes?

07:13.760 --> 07:16.206
He doesn't deserve your mercy.

07:16.520 --> 07:17.521
Maybe not.

07:17.920 --> 07:20.241
Once he's recovered,
you can turn him over to the authorities.

07:20.320 --> 07:21.606
I ken ye've just returned,

07:22.200 --> 07:25.204
so maybe ye dinna recall
the workings of the law in this time.

07:25.440 --> 07:26.885
But all they'll see is that you were alone

07:26.960 --> 07:29.088
with a man that's not yer husband,
in a brothel.

07:30.120 --> 07:32.088
- I'm not a whore.
- Doesna matter.

07:32.160 --> 07:33.161
If the City Guard come here,

07:33.240 --> 07:34.969
they'll arrest you
for having assaulted him.

07:37.440 --> 07:38.566
I'll have to hurry.

07:42.000 --> 07:43.161
Stubborn as always.

07:45.160 --> 07:46.286
Well, do as you must.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.764
I've casks to rid myself of.

07:52.960 --> 07:55.725
I'll send a man up to watch over him
while we're gone.

08:04.280 --> 08:07.489
I admire a woman
who values the sanctity of human life.

08:07.560 --> 08:10.689
Then you can be the one to go up
and keep an eye on him.

08:10.800 --> 08:14.168
'Tis weak-minded if ye ask me.
Try to kill a man, then heal him.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.250
Only wish that we could kill him.

08:16.320 --> 08:19.449
I've been wantin' to gut
a filthy excise man for years.

08:19.920 --> 08:23.561
Well, Milady's always been a unique woman.

08:23.960 --> 08:24.961
Aye.

08:25.040 --> 08:26.690
What about the print shop, Uncle Jamie?

08:26.760 --> 08:29.764
If Sir Percival sent men here,
he may look there as well.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.491
Let him look.
I dinna keep casks at the shop.

08:32.559 --> 08:34.722
Aye, but you do keep other items there.

08:35.760 --> 08:38.240
Sir Percival doesna ken that,
and he never will.

08:38.880 --> 08:40.291
No one will find a trace of the pamphlets.

08:40.360 --> 08:41.725
They're well hidden.

08:41.799 --> 08:45.521
Besides, movin' them now would be
more dangerous than leavin' 'em be.

08:45.600 --> 08:48.843
Particularly now that ye're
under Sir Percivals watchful gaze.

08:49.320 --> 08:51.209
Which is why I'm entrusting you

08:51.880 --> 08:53.769
with the selling
of the casks, without delay,

08:54.200 --> 08:57.522
even if it means taking a loss.
We canna risk them being discovered.

08:58.040 --> 08:59.326
I willnae disappoint ye, Uncle Jamie.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.281
That's why I tasked ye with it.

09:11.040 --> 09:13.646
Do ye have anything
that might calm nerves?

09:14.040 --> 09:17.931
An old wise woman said
that mandrake root would do the trick.

09:18.520 --> 09:19.965
Nah, I dinna keep that root.

09:20.480 --> 09:22.084
Caused frightful symptoms, I'm afraid.

09:22.640 --> 09:24.210
I'm so sorry. I don't mean to be rude,

09:24.280 --> 09:26.726
but I have a situation
that requires immediate attention.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.245
Please wait your turn, madam.

09:28.320 --> 09:29.651
But it's urgent.

09:29.720 --> 09:31.563
So, too, is the health of my dear sister.

09:32.240 --> 09:33.287
And what of hemlock?

09:33.440 --> 09:36.125
'Tis said that ii aids symptoms
such as hers.

09:36.360 --> 09:37.725
I'm an experienced healer.

09:37.800 --> 09:41.327
I would be happy to treat your sister
if you just allow me to go ahead of you.

09:41.600 --> 09:44.649
Free of charge?
In recognition of my generosity?

09:44.920 --> 09:45.921
Of course.

09:46.800 --> 09:47.801
Thank you.

09:48.040 --> 09:52.125
I'll need a bottle of laudanum,
some ground yarrow root, and tormentil.

09:52.200 --> 09:54.521
And please hurry,
a man's life is at stake.

09:54.960 --> 09:58.760
You seem to ken yer remedies.
What ails the poor man?

09:59.040 --> 10:00.326
It's a severe head wound.

10:00.400 --> 10:01.401
Aye.

10:01.640 --> 10:04.564
My sister's condition
relates to her head as well.

10:04.640 --> 10:06.722
But 'tis more
of a nervous complaint of sorts.

10:07.800 --> 10:09.928
- That'll be two shillings, madam.
- Yes.

10:13.640 --> 10:17.440
Thank you. I have to go,
but I can pay your sister a visit later.

10:17.520 --> 10:18.681
I'd be grateful.

10:18.920 --> 10:21.844
You can call on us at Henderson's
in Carubbers Close.

10:21.920 --> 10:25.049
Campbell is the name.
Archibald and Margaret Campbell.

10:25.360 --> 10:26.361
Thank you.

10:34.960 --> 10:36.291
Fifty for the lot of 'em.

10:37.040 --> 10:41.204
McDaniel, ye're looking at
100 pounds worth of fine brandy here.

10:41.680 --> 10:44.729
French brandy,
imported from Cognac itself.

10:44.800 --> 10:46.290
It is a truly superior brandy.

10:46.600 --> 10:49.843
You can charge more for that
and make a braw profit.

10:50.640 --> 10:51.641
Fifty.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.724
I like ye, McDaniel,

10:54.840 --> 10:58.811
so I'll not be put off
by yer paltry offering. Seventy-five.

11:02.240 --> 11:03.241
Seventy.

11:03.680 --> 11:05.011
I'll no go higher.

11:05.480 --> 11:06.925
Without the Crown's seal,

11:07.000 --> 11:09.924
I'm the one taking all the risk
possessing your contraband.

11:11.920 --> 11:13.081
Seventy-five pounds,

11:13.160 --> 11:15.766
and you'll get three cask
of the créme de menthe as well.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.161
What do ye say?

11:26.840 --> 11:30.049
I'm no a man
to refuse liquors at no charge.

11:31.040 --> 11:32.201
Ye have a bargain.

11:32.680 --> 11:34.569
Ye're a good man. Thank you.

11:34.960 --> 11:37.611
I'll send up a few lads
to give you a hand.

11:42.040 --> 11:44.407
You even managed to rid us
of some of that créme de menthe.

11:47.480 --> 11:49.801
Do you remember Auntie Claire
all those years ago?

11:51.240 --> 11:54.403
I was no more than a boy,
but I remember her well.

11:55.880 --> 11:58.008
Well, what was she like?

11:58.320 --> 12:00.800
Spirited and incredibly brave.

12:01.640 --> 12:04.246
Milady was fearless
in the battles prior to Culloden.

12:04.880 --> 12:08.327
She would heal men
who'd been out in half by swords,

12:08.760 --> 12:11.161
blown to pieces by cannon fire...

12:11.880 --> 12:13.291
Without flinching.

12:15.720 --> 12:19.805
She saved many lives,
though there were rumours.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.771
What kind of rumours?

12:22.440 --> 12:24.442
That Milady took a few lives as well.

12:24.520 --> 12:26.761
She's not a woman
you want to cross, mon ami.

12:28.920 --> 12:32.402
If Auntie Claire was forced to kill men,
likely they deserved it.

12:33.360 --> 12:36.842
Even so, she has created
a bit of a catastrophe, no?

12:36.920 --> 12:38.081
Aye.

12:40.520 --> 12:41.726
Hold his legs.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.240
What are you doing?

12:46.040 --> 12:48.691
Well, the bastard woke
and started making considerable noise.

12:49.080 --> 12:51.811
He's having a lucid interval.
Ii happens with a brain injury.

12:51.880 --> 12:53.405
You can't be rough
with his head like that!

12:53.480 --> 12:55.005
You ken a better way to keep him quiet?

12:55.080 --> 12:56.081
Yes.

12:59.600 --> 13:00.601
Remove the stock.

13:02.120 --> 13:03.326
Remove it.

13:15.920 --> 13:17.081
Left pupil's dilated.

13:17.680 --> 13:19.205
The pressure's building up
inside the skull.

13:19.840 --> 13:22.764
I'm going to have to operate immediately.
Yi Tien Cho, untie him.

13:22.840 --> 13:24.683
Of course, Honourable Wife.

13:24.760 --> 13:25.921
- Aye?
- Monsieur Malcolm?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.480
- What is it?
- Sir Percival is here to see you.

13:31.240 --> 13:32.241
I'll be down straight away.

13:42.680 --> 13:43.841
Sir Percival.

13:47.480 --> 13:50.484
Here for a midday romp?

13:51.360 --> 13:52.885
I can assure you, Mr Malcolm,

13:52.960 --> 13:55.611
my interests today
relate only to business.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.925
Perhaps a quick taste
after our business is concluded?

14:00.840 --> 14:03.161
Don't make me regret hiring you.

14:03.760 --> 14:06.127
I'm here to search these premises at once.

14:07.080 --> 14:08.525
And what cause have ye to do that?

14:09.360 --> 14:12.887
You are withholding from me, Mr Malcolm.

14:37.600 --> 14:39.568
I assure you, Sir Percival,

14:39.640 --> 14:42.041
there is nothing
hidden in my establishment.

14:42.400 --> 14:47.008
But don't take our word for it.
Ye're welcome to see for yourself.

14:47.080 --> 14:50.084
Of course I am.
I certainly don't need your permission.

15:09.240 --> 15:11.129
Won't this kill him?

15:12.280 --> 15:13.281
No.

15:13.880 --> 15:16.281
But the pressure on his brain will
if I don't release it.

15:56.680 --> 15:57.681
There...

15:59.400 --> 16:00.561
The clot's released.

16:11.640 --> 16:14.086
Well, don't just stand there!
Search with me!

16:29.800 --> 16:31.086
Get over here.

16:32.480 --> 16:33.481
Is that brandy?

16:40.640 --> 16:43.371
No, Sir Percival. lt's just water.

16:44.480 --> 16:47.643
We have a leak. It is why I cannot store
anything of value down here.

16:49.560 --> 16:50.766
There's nothing 'ere!

16:51.280 --> 16:52.441
How can we be sure?

16:52.800 --> 16:54.768
We've searched the whole basement.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.127
I know you're up to something,
Mr Malcolm.

16:58.200 --> 16:59.440
I'll be watching you!

17:03.720 --> 17:04.721
Christ.

17:05.760 --> 17:08.684
I barely got rid of Sir Percival.
This ends now.

17:10.680 --> 17:11.681
Sassenach.

17:17.520 --> 17:18.521
Well, he's dead...

17:20.440 --> 17:21.726
So you've got your wish.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.486
Honourable Wife fought hard for his life.

17:40.640 --> 17:42.085
Put best foot forward.

17:46.880 --> 17:48.245
Aye. Well...

17:49.080 --> 17:51.162
I'll no grieve
for the man that tried to kill my wife.

17:51.680 --> 17:54.126
Fetch Lesley and Hayes.
I'll need help moving the body.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.889
'Tis better this way, Sassenach.

18:06.040 --> 18:09.522
Ye tried, but God took him.

18:10.640 --> 18:12.563
God has nothing to do with this.

18:13.840 --> 18:15.001
If ailed him.

18:16.320 --> 18:19.722
If I'd been in a proper hospital
or in Boston, I...

18:19.800 --> 18:22.280
But ye're not in Boston.

18:24.040 --> 18:26.441
I don't expect you to understand, but...

18:30.320 --> 18:35.884
I've dedicated the past 14 years
to respecting human life,

18:37.280 --> 18:39.521
to healing people without judgement.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.446
I work hard.

18:48.520 --> 18:50.443
I don't often lose a patient.

18:53.080 --> 18:57.324
There'll be other chances
to put your knowledge and skills to use.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.521
Others to save.

19:02.200 --> 19:03.361
Like ye did last time you came.

19:08.840 --> 19:09.966
I suppose you're right.

19:16.880 --> 19:18.962
I've caused you so much trouble.

19:20.000 --> 19:22.048
Just dropped in out of the clear blue sky.

19:22.440 --> 19:25.046
Put your livelihood...

19:26.040 --> 19:28.042
- Your life, in jeopardy.
Sassenach.

19:29.920 --> 19:34.847
You came thousands of miles
and 200 years to find me.

19:36.640 --> 19:40.281
I'm grateful that you are here,
no matter the cost.

19:41.880 --> 19:45.521
I would give up everything I have
for us to be together again.

19:46.160 --> 19:47.241
Don't ye see?

19:48.840 --> 19:50.285
Ever since you left, I...

19:51.360 --> 19:53.601
I've been living in the shadows.

19:54.880 --> 19:56.769
And then you walked into
the print shop, and...

19:59.400 --> 20:02.290
It was as if the sun returned

20:03.160 --> 20:04.810
and cast out the darkness.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.209
I have another patient to see.

20:20.160 --> 20:21.321
I won't be long.

20:22.480 --> 20:23.481
Patient?

20:24.320 --> 20:25.401
And who might that be?

20:26.640 --> 20:27.687
Margaret Campbell.

20:28.160 --> 20:31.323
I met her brother at Haugh's,
and I offered to examine her.

20:31.400 --> 20:32.970
But ye dinna ken who these people are.

20:40.960 --> 20:41.961
Ye canna go alone.

20:42.960 --> 20:44.883
Fergus will escort you.

20:44.960 --> 20:49.761
As you said, I've travelled
thousands of miles and 200 years.

20:50.960 --> 20:53.167
I can certainly manage
to get across town alone.

20:53.240 --> 20:55.766
Aye, but Sir Percival...

20:55.840 --> 20:57.649
Sir Percival doesn't know who I am...

20:58.600 --> 20:59.647
Or...

21:02.000 --> 21:04.002
Or what I've done
to the man who worked for him.

21:05.280 --> 21:06.281
You will

21:07.280 --> 21:08.281
return...

21:09.800 --> 21:10.847
Afterward?

21:17.600 --> 21:18.601
Of course.

21:45.280 --> 21:46.930
To a master salesman!

21:47.760 --> 21:49.808
Thanks to you,
we made a handsome profit today.

21:49.880 --> 21:51.211
- Ye think so?
- Aye.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.806
You have a natural gift
when it comes to business,

21:53.880 --> 21:54.881
just like Milord.

21:58.760 --> 21:59.761
I've been meaning to ask ye.

22:00.360 --> 22:03.682
Does French brandy really
increase the firmness of a cock-stand?

22:04.000 --> 22:08.289
Well, in my experience,
the result is quite the opposite,

22:08.360 --> 22:11.807
but all that matters is that I convinced
the buyer that it does, non?

22:11.880 --> 22:13.803
Aye. Ye had me convinced.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.121
We make a good pair.

22:17.520 --> 22:20.569
Perhaps we should venture
to open a business of our own one day.

22:21.400 --> 22:24.051
There's money to be made
in this city, and...

22:27.560 --> 22:28.686
Mademoiselle Brighid.

22:29.480 --> 22:32.165
I see you watching her
every time were here.

22:33.320 --> 22:35.766
She's enchanting, no?

22:36.680 --> 22:37.886
Bonny.

22:42.040 --> 22:43.724
What are you doing?

22:43.840 --> 22:45.080
Tonight is the night
you do more than just look.

22:45.160 --> 22:46.764
Well, I've never

22:46.840 --> 22:47.921
bedded a lass before.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.604
Then this is your opportunity, brother.

22:51.840 --> 22:54.127
Well, how old were you when...

22:54.200 --> 22:56.248
Fifteen. A ménage é trois.

22:56.320 --> 22:59.529
- A what?
- Two women and one moi.

23:00.360 --> 23:01.407
Christ.

23:01.480 --> 23:04.484
It was a rather religious experience.

23:07.120 --> 23:08.690
I dinna ken what to do.

23:14.200 --> 23:17.044
The art of seduction can be mastered thus.

23:18.360 --> 23:21.489
First, you must look into her eyes

23:21.560 --> 23:24.689
and tell her how beautiful she is.

23:25.640 --> 23:30.521
Second, offer her a drink,
whatever her heart desires.

23:31.400 --> 23:32.447
Simple enough.

23:32.520 --> 23:36.002
And the piéce de résistance
is perhaps the most important part.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.241
What is it?

23:38.400 --> 23:41.324
Repeat one and two.

23:50.720 --> 23:51.846
What can I fetch ye?

23:54.560 --> 23:55.891
Nothin'.

23:55.960 --> 24:00.010
Nothing? Are ye sure?
Yer friend just beckoned me over.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.082
Ye're the bonniest lass
I've ever set eyes on.

24:02.760 --> 24:05.969
Can I offer ye a drink?
Whatever yer heart desires.

24:13.480 --> 24:14.481
Whisky.

24:54.080 --> 24:55.081
Margaret.

24:56.320 --> 24:57.731
I've brought someone to see you.

24:58.800 --> 25:00.165
Will ye no look alive?

25:02.440 --> 25:03.601
We have a guest.

25:04.440 --> 25:08.240
Can they come back later, Archie?
I'm very tired.

25:08.360 --> 25:11.125
It's no a client, Margaret. It's a healer.

25:13.480 --> 25:14.481
What have you given her?

25:14.560 --> 25:16.927
A few drops of laudanum, to keep her calm.

25:25.840 --> 25:26.921
Do you hear 'em?

25:27.680 --> 25:31.002
Do you hear the tree toads' lullaby?

25:31.920 --> 25:33.888
And the moon.

25:33.960 --> 25:36.008
The moon be choking with blood.

25:37.560 --> 25:38.641
Ye best be careful.

25:39.160 --> 25:41.049
Abandawe will devour ye!

25:41.280 --> 25:46.002
Abandawe! Abandawe! Abandawe!

25:55.080 --> 25:56.320
Her pulse is strong.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.404
But you shouldn't give her
any more laudanum.

25:59.840 --> 26:02.127
It's far too potent for daily use.

26:04.280 --> 26:05.850
D'ye ken the meaning of what she said?

26:07.280 --> 26:08.281
No.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.641
I'd be happy to translate her vision...
For a modest fee.

26:16.840 --> 26:18.080
So you're fortune tellers.

26:18.160 --> 26:19.161
Aye.

26:20.040 --> 26:24.090
Margaret's a seer, but isn't able
to articulate what she sees.

26:24.760 --> 26:26.489
Without me to decipher the message,

26:27.360 --> 26:30.409
her visions are no more
than raving gibberish.

26:31.240 --> 26:32.651
Does she have trouble sleeping?

26:32.720 --> 26:36.281
Aye. Some nights, she canna rest at all.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.843
Nightmares plague her fiercely.

26:39.840 --> 26:42.730
Does she ever sit still,

26:42.800 --> 26:45.451
unresponsive, for long periods of time?

26:45.520 --> 26:46.567
Aye.

26:47.160 --> 26:48.571
Starin' at the walls.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.484
When she's in such a state,
I canna get her to talk,

26:51.560 --> 26:52.721
let alone move.

26:54.560 --> 26:57.803
Mr Campbell, from what I can discern,
your sister isn't a seer.

26:59.280 --> 27:01.681
She's suffering from a mental disorder.

27:03.040 --> 27:05.122
Aye. As I told ye earlier,

27:05.200 --> 27:07.089
Margaret's been soft in the head
since she was a bairn.

27:09.360 --> 27:10.885
Do you have any writing implements?

27:10.960 --> 27:12.724
Aye. On the desk.

27:20.880 --> 27:23.645
These are instructions for mistletoe tea.

27:23.960 --> 27:26.088
Whenever Margaret is agitated,

27:26.160 --> 27:28.686
you can give her the tea
with a few drops of tansy oil.

27:29.640 --> 27:30.846
And...

27:30.960 --> 27:33.008
You can make a tea
with valerian to help her sleep.

27:33.640 --> 27:36.211
Are you sure simple teas
are enough to keep her subdued?

27:37.920 --> 27:39.524
Well, why would you want to subdue her?

27:40.200 --> 27:44.046
Margaret has a great deal of curiosity
when she has her wits about her.

27:44.200 --> 27:45.850
She marches up to strangers.

27:45.920 --> 27:49.129
She touches them and tells them
things they didn't ask to hear.

27:49.200 --> 27:53.489
It scares them something awful sometimes,
putting me in a very difficult position.

27:55.400 --> 27:58.006
Of course, it's different
when they come seeking her talents,

27:59.000 --> 28:00.650
because I can charge them then, you see.

28:03.920 --> 28:05.524
And Margaret enjoys this work?

28:05.600 --> 28:06.726
Aye.

28:07.800 --> 28:09.450
It's the only way
she can engage with people

28:09.520 --> 28:10.681
that doesna give them a fright.

28:14.400 --> 28:16.402
I'd like to come see Margaret
again tomorrow,

28:16.720 --> 28:17.881
if that would be all right.

28:18.320 --> 28:21.244
That's very kind of ye,
but we are departing for the West Indies.

28:22.080 --> 28:23.127
West Indies?

28:25.120 --> 28:27.009
That would be an arduous journey for her.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.923
That's why I need tonics.

28:30.680 --> 28:33.331
I dinna want her
carrying on during our long journey.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.569
Sailors are a superstitious lot.

28:36.680 --> 28:38.569
I canna risk them
pitchin' my sister overboard,

28:39.480 --> 28:42.165
not when we have a wealthy client
to administer to.

28:46.640 --> 28:48.324
Well, when you get to the West Indies,

28:48.960 --> 28:51.122
make sure she eats plenty of fresh fruit.

28:51.560 --> 28:54.131
And, please, no more laudanum.

28:55.360 --> 28:56.361
No more laudanum.

29:03.120 --> 29:04.451
Thank you for your help.

29:07.720 --> 29:08.846
You're welcome.

29:10.720 --> 29:12.563
And safe travels.

29:29.040 --> 29:32.886
I pass the day in pain

29:33.440 --> 29:36.205
When nigh! returns

29:36.280 --> 29:38.931
I feel the smart

29:39.360 --> 29:43.206
And wish for thee in vain...

29:43.280 --> 29:44.930
Ian, you're a terrible singer.

29:45.000 --> 29:48.288
<i>I'm starving cold</i>

29:48.360 --> 29:50.488
While thou art warm

29:50.880 --> 29:54.202
Have pity, and incline

29:54.280 --> 29:56.248
I dinna think it could get any worse.

29:57.000 --> 30:00.368
And grant me for a hap

30:00.920 --> 30:06.927
That charming petticoat of thine

30:33.440 --> 30:34.805
What are ye doin?

30:36.240 --> 30:37.526
Is this not how it's done?

30:38.360 --> 30:40.010
I thought ye worked out
of a kittle-hoosie?

30:40.600 --> 30:43.410
Aye. I've seen some
of the whores do it like this.

30:43.480 --> 30:46.165
Aye, but I'm no a whore tonight, am I?

30:47.080 --> 30:48.081
No.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.965
You're, without a doubt,

30:50.520 --> 30:52.966
the finest lass I've e'er set eyes on.

31:06.280 --> 31:09.887
Tell me how you like it.
I'll do whatever ye want.

31:11.720 --> 31:14.121
Lie down, and I'll show ye.

31:35.560 --> 31:36.925
What have you done with the body?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.206
The lads hid it
in a cask of créme de menthe,

31:41.480 --> 31:43.642
stored along
with the others at my warehouse.

31:45.480 --> 31:48.802
There are worse places
for one's eternal rest, Claire.

31:50.200 --> 31:53.682
Won't someone
look inside the cask sooner or later?

31:54.720 --> 31:55.960
Not for a long while.

31:56.760 --> 31:58.285
Alcohol slows the decay.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.481
Besides, it's not likely to be broached.

32:02.800 --> 32:05.406
I've never seen a Scotsman
drink creme de menthe.

32:07.800 --> 32:09.131
Dinna fash, Sassenach.

32:09.760 --> 32:12.240
'Twas no more than a wee bit of a chaos.

32:12.920 --> 32:14.206
Nothin' we haven't seen before.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.841
Jamie...

32:19.800 --> 32:21.882
Maybe we would find a place of our own.

32:24.920 --> 32:25.921
And leave the brothel?

32:30.240 --> 32:32.811
Surely you don't expect us
to make a home here.

32:34.840 --> 32:38.083
Well, not forever, perhaps,
but, for now, we have everything we need,

32:39.040 --> 32:40.201
and there's no rent to pay.

32:40.280 --> 32:42.647
Nearly every shilling I earn
is sent to Lallybroch.

32:44.760 --> 32:45.761
Well, I was thinking...

32:46.760 --> 32:48.330
Maybe I could make some money

32:48.800 --> 32:49.801
as a healer.

32:51.040 --> 32:53.247
It felt good today to have a patient.

32:54.680 --> 32:58.127
Perhaps I could work
from the back of the print shop

32:58.800 --> 33:00.882
or open an establishment of my own.

33:03.080 --> 33:06.050
We could build a happy life
here in Edinburgh.

33:08.200 --> 33:11.807
Monsieur Malcolm? A gentleman
named Ian Murray is here for you.

33:11.880 --> 33:12.881
I'll be down at once.

33:12.960 --> 33:15.327
Ian? Well, what's he doing here?

33:15.400 --> 33:17.050
Likely looking for Young Ian.

33:19.960 --> 33:21.121
Dinna mention that you've seen him.

33:22.760 --> 33:23.761
I'll explain later.

33:33.400 --> 33:34.401
Ian?

33:37.880 --> 33:38.881
Ian.

33:46.120 --> 33:47.121
Claire?

33:50.280 --> 33:51.281
It's so good to see you.

34:00.400 --> 34:01.401
It is you, lass.

34:03.760 --> 34:05.410
- We thought you were...
- I know.

34:06.800 --> 34:08.290
I know what Jamie told you.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.971
He thought I'd died
in the aftermath of Culloden.

34:15.040 --> 34:16.246
Jenny and I...

34:17.560 --> 34:19.324
We grieved over ye for years.

34:21.280 --> 34:22.884
Claire believed me to be dead as well.

34:24.040 --> 34:26.610
It was a terrible misunderstanding
that kept us apart.

34:29.719 --> 34:31.484
Where on earth have ye been all this time?

34:33.719 --> 34:34.766
Boston.

34:36.120 --> 34:40.045
I sailed there
when I thought that Jamie had died.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.010
I would have returned sooner,

34:42.400 --> 34:45.449
but I just recently
discovered he was alive.

34:45.560 --> 34:49.246
That's when she came back to find me.
And I'm more than happy she did.

34:53.000 --> 34:54.331
What brings you here?

34:56.480 --> 34:57.481
It's Young Ian.

34:58.320 --> 35:00.482
He's run off again. Have ye seen him?

35:01.320 --> 35:03.322
No. He isna here.

35:05.040 --> 35:07.122
- How long has the lad been gone?
- Weeks.

35:07.640 --> 35:10.405
And the last time my son ran away,
he came to see you.

35:10.480 --> 35:11.891
Are ye sure?

35:11.960 --> 35:13.121
I havena seen him.

35:13.360 --> 35:15.601
Not since I sent him home
with Fergus months ago.

35:16.160 --> 35:17.161
Christ, Jamie.

35:18.080 --> 35:19.320
Well, where else could he be?

35:19.640 --> 35:21.051
Jenny is woefully distressed.

35:21.120 --> 35:23.168
What if he's been taken by a press gang?

35:24.040 --> 35:26.930
If that were to happen,
we'd never see him again.

35:27.000 --> 35:28.650
Dinna fash.

35:29.200 --> 35:31.521
The press gangs will no
he able to thole the lad.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.523
They'll throw him off
before they leave port.

35:34.800 --> 35:36.325
I'm sure he'll appear.

35:36.920 --> 35:40.208
Promise me, if he should turn up here,
ye'll bring him straight home.

35:40.760 --> 35:42.364
Yeah. I will.

35:44.240 --> 35:47.687
Let's not delay yer search any longer.
I'll see you out.

35:54.000 --> 35:55.411
Goodbye for now, Claire.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.409
I hope to see you and Jenny very soon.

36:00.600 --> 36:01.601
Aye.

36:13.520 --> 36:15.488
Claire must have taken yer news well.

36:15.560 --> 36:16.891
I havena told her yet.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.644
That's not something ye want
to hold on to for very long.

36:21.720 --> 36:24.530
I'm waiting for the proper time.
She's only just arrived.

36:24.600 --> 36:26.443
Ye might be waiting forever, then.

36:29.040 --> 36:32.010
All will be well. Ye'll see.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.201
Don't stop.

36:55.760 --> 36:57.364
- Did you not hear that?
- No.

37:01.840 --> 37:02.841
That I heard.

37:17.880 --> 37:19.006
Ye'd better go now.

37:19.080 --> 37:20.161
But what about you?

37:20.240 --> 37:21.241
I'll be fine.

37:21.480 --> 37:24.165
Run out the alley door
and dinna turn back.

37:24.240 --> 37:25.241
Okay.

37:29.280 --> 37:30.281
Go. Now.

37:36.240 --> 37:38.527
What are ye doing
trespassing in my uncle's shop?

37:39.160 --> 37:42.209
You know very well
what I'm doing here, boy.

37:42.320 --> 37:43.560
Where are the casks?

37:43.640 --> 37:46.803
There are no casks,
as you can see with your own eyes.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.927
There's nothing here. Now get out!

37:50.000 --> 37:53.447
Hey, I know that you're party
to your uncle's smuggling.

37:54.240 --> 37:56.971
Tell me, where is he hiding the liquor?

37:59.560 --> 38:01.085
What have we here?

38:05.520 --> 38:06.726
Get away from there!

38:10.760 --> 38:11.761
Hey.

38:15.000 --> 38:17.287
Your uncle's been a busy man.

38:18.960 --> 38:23.249
Betraying Sir Percival is one thing.
Inciting sedition...

38:23.360 --> 38:25.089
Leave! Now!

38:25.480 --> 38:26.481
Stand down!

38:29.680 --> 38:30.920
Bloody hell.

39:24.480 --> 39:27.051
The years apart couldna erase
the meaning behind that look.

39:30.760 --> 39:33.081
Since when do you lie to your family?

39:34.640 --> 39:35.721
Couldna very well tell him

39:35.800 --> 39:39.122
the lad's been helping me
with my smuggling, could I?

39:39.840 --> 39:42.650
You could have at least told him
you'd seen his son.

39:43.200 --> 39:45.089
Ian and Jenny must be in agony.

39:45.160 --> 39:46.810
Aye, but the lad's safe.

39:47.440 --> 39:48.441
Safe?

39:49.280 --> 39:52.887
Risking his neck, working for you
without his parents' permission?

39:53.280 --> 39:56.363
I've tried to send him home twice,
but he keeps coming back.

39:56.840 --> 40:00.561
Better he runs off to be with his uncle
than to some godforsaken place

40:00.640 --> 40:02.005
surrounded by strangers.

40:04.360 --> 40:07.967
On the streets of Aberdeen or Dundee.

40:08.520 --> 40:09.885
But you would have told him.

40:11.640 --> 40:12.801
Trust me, Claire.

40:13.360 --> 40:15.010
Jenny and Ian dinna ken
what's best for the lad.

40:16.000 --> 40:17.729
I'm the only one teaching him
the ways of the world.

40:18.800 --> 40:21.849
This isn't about the ways of the world.

40:21.920 --> 40:23.922
Young Ian ran away from home.

40:24.000 --> 40:26.731
Of course Ian and Jenny
want to know where he is.

40:27.840 --> 40:29.171
And you just lied.

40:29.280 --> 40:30.281
Aye.

40:31.440 --> 40:33.010
And ye shouldna judge me for it.

40:33.720 --> 40:36.610
Have ye forgotten about all
the deceptions we've colluded in?

40:37.400 --> 40:40.404
Yeah, we lied our way
through Paris, did we not?

40:40.480 --> 40:43.643
Did we not just lie to Ian about where
ye've been for the past 20 years?

40:43.720 --> 40:47.611
A white lie to conceal something
that Ian can't possibly understand...

40:47.680 --> 40:50.286
I didn't realise lies had shades.

40:52.480 --> 40:56.007
You have no idea
what it's like to be a worried parent.

40:56.080 --> 40:58.321
You're not the boy's father, Jamie.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.201
No.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.005
I'm Brianna's father.

41:08.720 --> 41:10.563
But I didnae get to raise her, did I?

41:13.920 --> 41:17.288
I didn't have a say
in how you and Frank brought her up,

41:18.600 --> 41:19.647
wearing that...

41:20.280 --> 41:22.931
That wretched thing ye call a bikini.

41:24.800 --> 41:28.009
Even whores have the decency
not to go parading about in the like.

41:28.080 --> 41:29.366
Christ.

41:29.440 --> 41:32.649
I'd forgotten
how bloody rigid this century is.

41:33.160 --> 41:35.606
A woman is either a Madonna or a whore.

41:35.720 --> 41:39.167
So, if Frank and I
had raised Brianna to be a criminal,

41:39.920 --> 41:43.925
taught her how to smuggle
and be a traitor, then you'd approve?

41:44.920 --> 41:47.082
At least her virtue
wouldn't have been endangered.

41:50.480 --> 41:53.290
Says the man living in a brothel.

41:56.480 --> 42:00.201
I'll have you know that Frank
was a wonderful father to Brianna.

42:00.280 --> 42:01.281
Was he, now?

42:04.440 --> 42:07.205
And was he a wonderful husband
to you as well?

42:08.680 --> 42:09.920
What is that supposed to mean?

42:10.760 --> 42:11.761
You asked me...

42:13.280 --> 42:14.884
Did I fall in love with anyone else?

42:17.560 --> 42:19.449
Did you fall in love with him
when you went back?

42:21.080 --> 42:22.081
No.

42:22.880 --> 42:24.962
I cared for Frank very much,

42:25.680 --> 42:27.489
and I loved him, but that was before you.

42:29.160 --> 42:30.161
Monsieur Malcolm!

42:31.640 --> 42:33.529
There is a fire in Carfax Close.

42:33.920 --> 42:34.921
Fire?

42:35.840 --> 42:36.966
The print shop.

42:52.520 --> 42:53.521
Christ.

42:54.920 --> 42:55.921
Ian.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.929
- What are you doing?
- Young Ian...

42:59.000 --> 43:00.570
Sleeps in the back!

43:01.760 --> 43:03.808
- Jamie!
- Make way!

43:08.240 --> 43:09.241
Move back!

43:36.680 --> 43:38.205
Ian.

43:39.160 --> 43:40.161
I've got you.

43:40.760 --> 43:42.410
- Uncle Jamie.
-It's all right, lad.

43:55.600 --> 43:57.762
More hose!

44:16.160 --> 44:17.161
Milady!

44:18.040 --> 44:19.451
We came as soon as we heard.

44:22.000 --> 44:23.081
Where's Milord?

44:23.920 --> 44:25.524
He went inside to get Young Ian.

44:37.880 --> 44:38.927
Keep back, folks!

44:56.600 --> 44:58.011
Keep back! We're doing our best!

45:16.440 --> 45:17.601
Move back there!

45:19.880 --> 45:21.086
There they are, there!

45:21.160 --> 45:22.491
Jamie!

45:22.560 --> 45:24.050
Oh, thank God.

45:33.560 --> 45:37.042
Quick! Clear the way!
Get him on the ground.

45:45.600 --> 45:47.284
Stay back! We're doing our best!

45:55.200 --> 45:56.201
Are you all right?

45:56.280 --> 45:57.566
I think so.

45:58.720 --> 46:00.768
But it isna me ye need to worry about.

46:02.280 --> 46:05.045
A man with a blind eye
broke into your print shop, uncle.

46:05.520 --> 46:07.682
- What?
- He found yer pamphlets.

46:09.880 --> 46:10.881
How?

46:10.960 --> 46:12.450
We started fighting.

46:12.520 --> 46:15.967
He threw me against the panels,
and they opened.

46:17.040 --> 46:20.044
- All right, lad. Calm down.
- But he works for Sir Percival.

46:22.040 --> 46:24.441
Milord, if he gives
the material to Sir Percival,

46:24.920 --> 46:27.491
he'll be able to arrest you
for more than smuggling.

46:27.560 --> 46:28.561
Aye.

46:30.080 --> 46:31.730
Sedition is far worse.

46:32.360 --> 46:34.567
High treason is a capital crime.

46:35.200 --> 46:38.124
Sir Percival arrests me,
he'll be awarded a king's ransom.

46:38.200 --> 46:40.043
I'm heart sorry, Uncle Jamie.

46:40.720 --> 46:42.165
I tried to stop him.

46:42.240 --> 46:44.811
Dinna fash, lad. It wasn't yer fault.

46:48.280 --> 46:49.645
What will you do, Milord?

46:51.840 --> 46:54.605
I'll leave with these two
for Berwick tonight.

46:54.960 --> 46:59.045
Jamie, you have to bring young Ian home,
to his parents...

47:00.280 --> 47:01.725
Where he'll be safe.

47:04.920 --> 47:05.921
Aye, all right.

47:07.320 --> 47:08.970
I'll take the lad home lo Lallybroch.

47:09.760 --> 47:12.411
Sir Percival will not
be able to trace me there.

47:12.480 --> 47:15.643
He only kens me
as Alexander Malcolm of Edinburgh.

47:16.960 --> 47:18.962
But first, I have some business to settle.

47:22.600 --> 47:25.843
Yer profits from the sale of the casks,

47:26.560 --> 47:28.961
as well as what is owed
to Lesley and Hayes.

47:29.040 --> 47:30.804
- Get it to them for me, will ye?
- I will.

47:30.880 --> 47:32.928
And stay out of sight.

47:34.200 --> 47:36.771
Likely there's a target
on your back as well as mine.

47:37.400 --> 47:38.401
Aye.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.771
Here's yer share as well.

47:45.240 --> 47:47.811
See if ye can intercept the man
with the blind eye...

47:47.880 --> 47:49.962
- Before he gets to Sir Percival.
- Of course, Milord.

47:50.040 --> 47:52.691
And tell Ned Gowan
to bring news to Lallybroch

47:53.720 --> 47:54.721
regarding the...

47:55.120 --> 47:56.770
That's it. Easy.

47:57.120 --> 47:59.043
...matter I inquired after.

47:59.960 --> 48:02.566
Perhaps there's a better place
for you to take Milady.

48:02.640 --> 48:06.611
Nae, dinna fash, lad.
Balriggan is miles away from Broch Mordha.

48:07.920 --> 48:10.685
Milady does not yet
know about your other wife?

48:11.120 --> 48:12.121
No.

48:13.360 --> 48:14.361
Not yet.

48:15.160 --> 48:18.562
I'll explain everything
once Claire and Young Ian are safe.

48:19.760 --> 48:20.841
Send word when ye can.

48:21.800 --> 48:22.801
Aye.
