00:02.402 --> 00:03.446
<i>Previously on</i> K.C. Undercover...

00:03.470 --> 00:04.856
I didn't get to properly
introduce myself before.

00:04.880 --> 00:08.898
I'm K.C. Cooper and...
I'm your cousin.

00:08.933 --> 00:10.926
Marisa, I am such an idiot.

00:10.928 --> 00:12.255
What if he doesn't like me
anymore and doesn't call...

00:12.279 --> 00:14.638
K.C., K.C.,
would you just relax.

00:14.673 --> 00:16.431
Darien likes you.
He isn't going anywhere.

00:16.466 --> 00:17.966
( Car tires screech )

00:18.001 --> 00:21.695
( car crash )

00:21.730 --> 00:24.042
Quick! Call an ambulance. A car just
came out of nowhere and hit Darien.

00:24.066 --> 00:26.349
( Grunts )

00:31.147 --> 00:33.331
Hey. What's up, Abby.

00:33.366 --> 00:35.153
Thank you so much for stopping
by and checking on Darien,

00:35.177 --> 00:37.377
but good news,
he's gonna be perfectly fine.

00:37.413 --> 00:39.279
Yeah, well, this time he is.

00:40.782 --> 00:42.057
What you talking about?

00:42.092 --> 00:46.119
His accident.
It wasn't an accident.

00:46.154 --> 00:48.132
( Chuckles ) I'm sorry,
that doesn't make any sense.

00:48.156 --> 00:49.796
Okay, who would
intentionally hurt Darien?

00:52.694 --> 00:54.252
I would.

00:59.135 --> 01:00.135
You missed.

01:02.954 --> 01:04.137
Down!

01:12.080 --> 01:14.965
What are you doing
next Saturday night?

01:15.000 --> 01:17.534
What was I doing
last Saturday night?

01:17.569 --> 01:21.221
- Nothing.
- Yep, I'll be doing that again.

01:21.256 --> 01:23.398
No, you won't. You are going
to a surprise party.

01:23.433 --> 01:24.449
For who?

01:24.484 --> 01:27.160
You.

01:27.195 --> 01:30.472
Okay, you do know how surprise
parties are supposed to work?

01:30.507 --> 01:33.725
Yes, but considering your line
of work, I thought it was best

01:33.760 --> 01:35.838
to tell you so you don't go
all Jackie Chan on the guests

01:35.862 --> 01:36.898
when they yell "Surprise."

01:36.922 --> 01:39.131
( chuckles )

01:39.166 --> 01:40.919
Marisa, you know me, okay.
I am not a party person.

01:40.943 --> 01:43.067
I'm a party pooper.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.979
K.C., come on,
you're about to be 17

01:46.014 --> 01:47.450
and a year from now
you're gonna be 18.

01:47.474 --> 01:50.525
And after that... who knows?

01:50.560 --> 01:53.962
I'm gonna go with 19.

01:53.998 --> 01:57.291
Yes, I knew that.

01:57.326 --> 02:00.326
I meant, how many more birthdays are we
gonna be able to celebrate together?

02:01.789 --> 02:03.329
Come on, please let me
do this for you.

02:03.365 --> 02:05.182
Okay, fine.

02:05.217 --> 02:08.142
Yay! And you'll wear
a pretty pretty party dress?

02:08.178 --> 02:10.136
( Brakes screech )

02:10.172 --> 02:14.524
Okay, fine, forget the dress!
Forget the dress!

02:14.559 --> 02:17.093
No no no,
I just saw my cousin Abby,

02:17.128 --> 02:20.155
right over there in that SUV!

02:20.190 --> 02:22.148
Your cousin Abby,
the cousin that you eliminated

02:22.184 --> 02:24.268
in the giant explosion
on the Potomac?

02:24.303 --> 02:28.279
I've heard of walkin' dead,
but not drivin' dead.

02:28.315 --> 02:31.474
No, that was definitely Abby.
But she's gone.

02:33.095 --> 02:36.996
I know, K.C., she's gone.

02:37.032 --> 02:38.765
No, I mean she ran
the yellow light.

02:38.801 --> 02:41.776
Yep, ran the big yellow light
in the sky.

02:43.897 --> 02:49.067
She's alive!
And that's not an expression!

02:49.103 --> 02:52.287
<i>¶ Oh, when danger
comes for you ¶</i>

02:52.322 --> 02:54.697
<i>¶ You know
I'll stand beside you ¶</i>

02:54.733 --> 02:58.301
<i>¶ 'Cause ain't nobody
keep their head so cool ¶</i>

02:58.336 --> 03:01.012
<i>¶ I'll always find a way ¶</i>

03:01.047 --> 03:04.266
<i>¶ A way out of the fire ¶</i>

03:04.268 --> 03:07.002
<i>¶ But don't tell nobody,
tell nobody ¶</i>

03:07.037 --> 03:09.337
<i>¶ I'm not perfect ¶</i>

03:09.373 --> 03:12.908
<i>¶ So many things
I wanna tell you ¶</i>

03:12.943 --> 03:15.910
<i>¶ But I... ¶</i>

03:15.946 --> 03:17.187
<i>¶ I keep it undercover ¶</i>

03:17.222 --> 03:19.455
<i>¶ Living my life on red alert ¶</i>

03:19.491 --> 03:21.002
<i>¶ Doing my thing,
I'll make it work ¶</i>

03:21.026 --> 03:23.910
<i>¶ Know I'm the realest,
baby I'm fearless ¶</i>

03:23.945 --> 03:25.704
<i>¶ But I always got your back ¶</i>

03:25.739 --> 03:28.072
<i>¶ Nobody can do it like I can ¶</i>

03:28.108 --> 03:30.074
<i>¶ I gotta find out who I am ¶</i>

03:30.110 --> 03:32.577
<i>¶ Ain't got to worry about me ¶</i>

03:32.613 --> 03:33.748
<i>¶ It's all part of the plan ¶</i>

03:33.772 --> 03:37.791
<i>¶ I keep it undercover
I keep it undercover ¶</i>

03:46.410 --> 03:48.112
- So, what's for dinner?
- What do you care?

03:48.136 --> 03:50.212
The only thing
you consume is electricity.

03:50.247 --> 03:52.388
( Chuckles ) Not anymore.

03:52.423 --> 03:53.098
We just came back
from The Organization.

03:53.133 --> 03:57.060
They were giving away free
upgrades and free sweat socks.

03:57.095 --> 04:01.531
Guess who got the upgrade, and
guess who got the sweat socks?

04:01.567 --> 04:04.534
Judy, eating will be great for
your undercover assignments.

04:04.536 --> 04:06.936
And you're going to love it.
Eating is really cool.

04:06.972 --> 04:10.991
You do it all the time.
How cool can it be?

04:11.026 --> 04:14.202
All right, let's break
your new digestive system in.

04:14.238 --> 04:15.498
Let's start with something easy.

04:15.522 --> 04:18.347
Ooh, how about applesauce?

04:18.383 --> 04:21.334
Fine. Let's get this over with.

04:21.369 --> 04:24.771
Open up your yum-yum hole.
Here comes the airplane.

04:24.806 --> 04:29.092
( Mimics airplane )

04:36.693 --> 04:38.226
That's it?

04:39.930 --> 04:41.646
That's eating?

04:41.681 --> 04:44.816
That's what you guys spend 90
percent of your day talking about?

04:47.253 --> 04:48.820
- What's that?
- That's just chocolate.

04:51.241 --> 04:53.116
( Heavenly music plays )

04:57.030 --> 04:59.080
Yeah, I'm going to need
some more of that.

05:03.745 --> 05:05.278
Hey, what are you doing?

05:05.314 --> 05:06.988
I just found a bug.

05:07.023 --> 05:08.465
What? Someone planted a bug?

05:12.245 --> 05:17.023
No, I found an actual bug.

05:17.058 --> 05:18.809
And you owe me
some new Begonias, missy.

05:18.844 --> 05:21.061
What's with you?

05:21.096 --> 05:25.623
Okay, um, this is gonna sound
a bit unbelievable,

05:25.659 --> 05:28.259
but when I was driving down
Rhode Island Avenue

05:28.294 --> 05:29.736
you are never
gonna guess who I saw.

05:29.772 --> 05:31.538
Well, I know
it wasn't your father

05:31.615 --> 05:33.956
because I asked him
to go to the market an hour ago

05:33.992 --> 05:36.392
and his butt is still sitting
on the couch watching the game!

05:38.989 --> 05:41.923
No, Mom, I saw my cousin Abby.

05:41.958 --> 05:45.018
Floating on the Potomac?

05:45.053 --> 05:48.571
No, driving in the SUV next
to me, not using her blinker.

05:48.606 --> 05:50.048
There is no end to her evil!

05:52.002 --> 05:54.035
I'm sorry, K.C.,

05:54.070 --> 05:56.538
- you saw your cousin Abby?
- Yes.

05:56.573 --> 05:58.456
She was wearing
a baseball cap and sunglasses,

05:58.491 --> 05:59.841
but I'm positive it was her.

05:59.876 --> 06:01.501
I totally recognized her.

06:01.536 --> 06:04.421
Okay, K.C., which is more
likely, honey, huh?

06:04.456 --> 06:06.606
That you saw someone
who looked like your cousin,

06:06.641 --> 06:08.883
or that Abby
came back from the Great Beyond

06:08.918 --> 06:11.119
for a little carpool karaoke?

06:11.154 --> 06:13.746
Mom, I'm serious. I saw her!

06:13.782 --> 06:18.818
Honey, now, eliminating someone
is the worst part of this job.

06:18.854 --> 06:21.087
But honey, sometimes,
we don't have a choice.

06:21.123 --> 06:24.056
And I really think this is your
guilt playing tricks on you.

06:24.092 --> 06:27.443
No, no, Mom, I am sure
that I saw her.

06:27.479 --> 06:28.987
( Sighs )

06:29.022 --> 06:31.055
Well, I'm pretty sure
it was her.

06:31.090 --> 06:33.908
No, I'm definitely...

06:33.943 --> 06:37.887
probably sure it was her...
I think.

06:42.627 --> 06:46.312
So I keep having
this reoccurring dream, right?

06:46.347 --> 06:49.090
Basically, I have a test
in my next class,

06:49.125 --> 06:52.077
but I've never
been to that class.

06:52.154 --> 06:54.329
And worse, I don't even know
where the class is.

06:54.406 --> 06:59.934
But when I do find the class:
Full of centaurs.

06:59.969 --> 07:02.220
I can't take the test,
because it's too loud

07:02.256 --> 07:04.622
because everyone's counting
with their hooves.

07:06.810 --> 07:08.530
But it's just a dream.
That's normal, right?

07:10.038 --> 07:14.857
Yeah, sure. No.

07:14.892 --> 07:17.452
Are we ever going to get around
to talking about the fact

07:17.487 --> 07:19.813
that you thought you saw
your deceased cousin?

07:19.890 --> 07:22.966
Yeah, that's been bothering me
a little bit too.

07:23.001 --> 07:25.663
K.C., you know it's just a manifestation
of the emotions you're feeling,

07:25.687 --> 07:28.688
emotions that you've buried
deep inside

07:28.723 --> 07:29.481
because you never really dealt
with what happened.

07:29.516 --> 07:33.585
Oh, trust me, I have dealt
with it every single day.

07:33.620 --> 07:36.897
Abby and Erica are gone because
of me, because of what I did.

07:36.932 --> 07:38.707
And I can handle that. I'm fine.

07:38.783 --> 07:41.743
I know everyone keeps saying
that I'm losing it,

07:41.778 --> 07:44.370
but I am holding it together,
I'm perfectly fine!

07:47.492 --> 07:49.676
Okay, I could use
a little bit of help.

07:49.711 --> 07:52.178
Alright, here's what
I want you to do.

07:52.213 --> 07:54.130
If you ever think
you see Abby again...

07:54.166 --> 07:57.008
- Eliminate her?
- No.

07:57.043 --> 07:59.319
Let me finish.

07:59.354 --> 08:02.438
I want you to steady yourself,
squeeze this stress ball,

08:02.473 --> 08:04.624
and repeat this mantra:

08:04.659 --> 08:07.152
"It's not really happening.
It's not really happening."

08:07.187 --> 08:09.629
- Can you do that?
- Mm-hmm.

08:09.664 --> 08:12.073
And in the meantime, go do
something that's not spy work,

08:12.108 --> 08:14.734
something that
actual teenagers would do.

08:14.769 --> 08:18.863
Go on a date. Go have fun.
Go shopping at the mall.

08:18.898 --> 08:20.890
Did my friend Marisa
put you up to this?

08:20.926 --> 08:23.384
It is either this

08:23.420 --> 08:25.340
or you're going on a break
from The Organization.

08:26.164 --> 08:27.814
Okay, fine.

08:27.849 --> 08:31.735
I'll try to do
more teenager stuff.

08:31.770 --> 08:34.721
But what do you suggest I do
about that centaur thing?

08:34.756 --> 08:38.474
Well, if worst comes to worst, you can
always blow them up on the Potomac.

08:38.509 --> 08:39.669
Too soon. I realize that now.

08:43.298 --> 08:45.373
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

08:45.408 --> 08:47.934
You know what? You're right.

08:47.969 --> 08:50.369
I was just buggin'. There's no
way that I could've seen Abby.

08:57.079 --> 08:59.988
Abby! Get in here.
We have an important mission.

09:03.827 --> 09:06.494
I hope it's to open
some windows in here.

09:06.529 --> 09:08.599
Do you always have to douse
yourself in toilet water?

09:08.623 --> 09:12.491
It's "toilette water".

09:12.527 --> 09:15.829
And if I open a window,
it'll be to throw you out of it.

09:15.864 --> 09:17.847
We're looking for David Simmons.

09:17.883 --> 09:21.251
He designed the security system
for the U.S. Treasury vaults.

09:21.286 --> 09:23.953
It is our job to locate, abduct,

09:23.988 --> 09:26.506
and threaten him
until he tells us

09:26.541 --> 09:27.798
how to get inside those vaults.

09:27.834 --> 09:32.470
And then we go on the biggest
shopping spree of all time.

09:32.505 --> 09:35.907
Lord knows you could use it.

09:35.942 --> 09:38.142
Seriously, Mother,
are those shoulder pads?

09:38.177 --> 09:40.111
( Painful grunt )

09:40.146 --> 09:42.447
Did that feel padded to you,
Miss Thing?

09:44.809 --> 09:47.335
Your father's going
to use that stolen money

09:47.370 --> 09:49.020
to bring down The Organization.

09:49.055 --> 09:50.074
( Muffled voice )
Sounds good to me.

09:50.098 --> 09:52.048
What are you eating?

09:52.083 --> 09:53.411
I went and got a burger
and some fries.

09:53.435 --> 09:55.660
From Gettysburger?!

09:55.695 --> 09:59.105
You know the Coopers live close to there!
You could've been spotted.

09:59.140 --> 10:01.182
Actually...

10:01.218 --> 10:03.342
She saw you?!

10:03.377 --> 10:06.788
See? This is why
I don't tell you anything.

10:06.823 --> 10:08.334
And relax. I was wearing
sunglasses and a hat.

10:08.358 --> 10:11.426
What about your face?

10:11.461 --> 10:13.353
Were you wearing your face?

10:15.765 --> 10:18.641
K.C. cannot get in the way
of this mission.

10:18.676 --> 10:20.260
If she does,
I have to eliminate her.

10:20.295 --> 10:22.904
Sweet! Make sure I get
an invite to that party.

10:28.970 --> 10:31.496
So did you get out the
invitations to my party?

10:31.531 --> 10:35.525
Oh, you mean the party
that I planned every detail of,

10:35.560 --> 10:38.527
invited everyone we know,
baked a cake for,

10:38.562 --> 10:40.307
and then you suddenly changed your mind
because you thought you saw your cousin

10:40.331 --> 10:42.331
and made me cancel everything,
that surprise party?

10:43.877 --> 10:46.093
Yep, that's the one. Um...

10:46.129 --> 10:49.497
So I was thinking
literary theme.

10:49.533 --> 10:52.850
Everyone comes dressed as their favorite
19th century fictional character.

10:54.679 --> 10:58.164
How are we even friends?

10:58.200 --> 11:00.583
Marisa, please. Okay,
come on, I need this party.

11:00.619 --> 11:04.020
I'm supposed to start
doing regular teenage stuff.

11:04.055 --> 11:07.284
Why can't you just break your curfew and talk
back to your parents like everyone else?

11:07.308 --> 11:09.784
Please?

11:09.819 --> 11:11.944
Okay, fine, fine. I'll just
have to re-book the DJ,

11:11.980 --> 11:15.290
re-order the food,
re-invite the guests...

11:15.325 --> 11:16.833
read a book...

11:19.687 --> 11:23.414
find a costume about that
book... ( continues talking )

11:23.449 --> 11:25.049
Okay.

11:25.084 --> 11:28.928
It's not really happening.
It's not really happening.

11:33.334 --> 11:34.934
And then the only thing
left to do

11:34.969 --> 11:37.145
is go shopping for your pretty,
pretty party dress.

11:39.983 --> 11:42.483
It's not really happening.
It's not really happening.

11:45.997 --> 11:48.781
Oh, you're still here. I guess
it doesn't work on everyone.

11:56.825 --> 11:59.258
( Snickering )

11:59.294 --> 12:02.345
Donut time!

12:02.380 --> 12:04.539
Oh! My donuts are gone.

12:04.574 --> 12:07.800
Hey, Judy?
Did you see my donuts?

12:07.835 --> 12:12.088
I dough-not know what you're
talking about.

12:12.123 --> 12:13.417
I was saving
those for my hump snack.

12:13.441 --> 12:15.308
What's a hump snack?

12:15.343 --> 12:18.819
The snack after the first snack,
to get me over the hump to dinner.

12:18.855 --> 12:19.855
Hump snack.

12:21.482 --> 12:23.957
Isn't that called lunch?

12:23.993 --> 12:26.335
Not called... You know what?

12:26.370 --> 12:27.498
Ever since you got that eating
upgrade, you've been out of control.

12:27.522 --> 12:29.580
- That's not true.
- It is so.

12:29.616 --> 12:33.692
You ate everything in the fridge,
including the baking soda!

12:33.728 --> 12:35.678
Yeah, it wasn't as good
as the regular soda.

12:35.713 --> 12:39.340
( Groans )

12:39.376 --> 12:42.735
You have literally eaten
everything in this entire house!

12:42.770 --> 12:44.987
What am I gonna do
for my late night hump snack?

12:45.022 --> 12:48.391
I'm never gonna make it
to breakfast!

12:48.468 --> 12:51.693
Oh, good. I'm glad you're here.
We have a mission.

12:51.729 --> 12:55.531
I hope it's to go grocery shopping. Judy's new
update is eating us out of house and home.

12:55.566 --> 12:59.226
Will you stop thinking about your
stomach and focus on the mission.

12:59.261 --> 13:02.472
Okay, now we have
to find David Simmons.

13:02.507 --> 13:05.044
He developed the security system for the Treasury.
After that, he retired and went off grid.

13:05.068 --> 13:08.778
If he's retired,
why does anyone care?

13:08.813 --> 13:11.239
Judy, you had a donut left?
Why didn't you tell me?

13:11.274 --> 13:14.842
You didn't ask.

13:14.878 --> 13:18.479
- If you don't...
- Stop it, you two!

13:18.515 --> 13:22.591
Now we have intel saying that the Other
Side is also looking for Simmons.

13:22.627 --> 13:25.236
Our mission is to locate him,
extract him, and protect him.

13:25.272 --> 13:26.504
Let's get to work.

13:31.444 --> 13:32.886
Do you have any donuts
left, Judy?

13:32.921 --> 13:35.054
No, I do not.

13:36.716 --> 13:37.949
What is that?!

13:37.984 --> 13:40.434
It's a donut<i> hole.</i>

13:46.667 --> 13:48.835
So when's my surprise party?

13:48.870 --> 13:50.578
Not telling.

13:50.613 --> 13:52.889
By the way, I ran out of money.

13:52.924 --> 13:54.804
Here's your portion
of the party bill. Surprise!

13:56.836 --> 13:58.611
So you're throwing me
a surprise party

13:58.646 --> 14:00.212
but I have to pay for it.

14:00.247 --> 14:02.590
Why am I not surprised?

14:02.667 --> 14:05.618
Okay, we should probably
work on your surprise face.

14:05.653 --> 14:07.820
So you walk in
at the appointed time,

14:07.855 --> 14:10.472
see everyone you know
dressed as...

14:10.508 --> 14:11.508
"book people".

14:16.038 --> 14:17.638
And go.

14:21.927 --> 14:23.255
( Thinking )
<i>It's not really happening.</i>

14:23.279 --> 14:25.438
<i>It's not really happening.</i>

14:29.368 --> 14:30.885
( sighs )

14:30.920 --> 14:33.621
Okay, that was
a little too surprised.

14:33.656 --> 14:36.065
More like freaked out.
Uh, are you okay?

14:36.100 --> 14:37.250
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine.

14:37.285 --> 14:40.495
Oh, I forgot to tell you.
I got an A on my math test!

14:40.530 --> 14:42.238
Wait, no way.

14:42.273 --> 14:46.058
Now that is a surprise face.

14:46.094 --> 14:47.677
By the way,
I didn't really get an A.

14:47.712 --> 14:50.004
I'm not really that surprised.

14:54.034 --> 14:58.429
So I've been scouring the Internet
for any trace of David Simmons.

15:04.061 --> 15:07.605
What? I eat now. Deal with it.

15:11.836 --> 15:15.138
( Belches loudly )

15:15.173 --> 15:18.240
Technically, that's not eating.
That's just disgusting.

15:20.303 --> 15:24.738
Anyway...

15:24.774 --> 15:27.516
Satellite tracking revealed
Simmons spends a lot of time

15:27.552 --> 15:30.311
in Bung Hill, West Virginia
at a biker hangout.

15:30.346 --> 15:33.497
But according to his credit
cards, he never buys anything.

15:33.533 --> 15:37.025
Sounds like your father
at the jewelry store.

15:37.061 --> 15:39.996
And the shoe store
and the phone store.

15:40.031 --> 15:42.473
Who buys one gig of data
for the entire family?

15:44.878 --> 15:46.869
At first I thought
he was just paying in cash.

15:46.905 --> 15:49.505
Which is a great way
to get a discount

15:49.541 --> 15:52.433
for someone who really wants a convertible
for their birthday next week.

15:52.469 --> 15:55.236
K.C., so which is it, I'm cheap,
or I'm buying you a car?

15:55.271 --> 16:00.457
Hey, there's only one way
to prove the haters wrong.

16:00.493 --> 16:04.587
But I found records that show
Simmons owns the biker hangout.

16:04.622 --> 16:06.355
Okay, nice work, Ernie.

16:06.391 --> 16:09.608
( Faint gurgling )

16:09.644 --> 16:11.477
What's that noise?

16:11.512 --> 16:16.007
I don't know, but it's coming from
you and it does not sound good.

16:16.042 --> 16:19.101
It's my new digestive system.
It's malfunctioning!

16:19.136 --> 16:23.030
No, actually,
I think it is functioning.

16:23.066 --> 16:24.957
Or at least it's about to.

16:24.993 --> 16:30.696
What's happening?!

16:30.731 --> 16:32.806
Okay, let's get moving.

16:32.842 --> 16:34.922
Well, looks like Judy's
already one step ahead of us.

16:37.046 --> 16:39.905
K.C., you have to come
to my house right now.

16:39.940 --> 16:42.224
Uh, Marisa, now's not really
a good time.

16:42.260 --> 16:44.493
Uh, well, too bad.

16:44.528 --> 16:47.037
Everyone's at my house for your
party, waiting to surprise you.

16:47.072 --> 16:51.500
In their book costumes.
Come on, let's go.

16:51.535 --> 16:53.338
Marisa, I really, I just
can't get away right now.

16:53.362 --> 16:55.070
Why not?

16:55.105 --> 16:59.308
Because I have
family obligations.

16:59.385 --> 17:03.546
Family obligations.
Oh, great. That's just great.

17:03.581 --> 17:06.774
I'm so glad that after you asked me
to cancel your first surprise party,

17:06.851 --> 17:08.817
you wanted me to re-throw you
a surprise party,

17:08.852 --> 17:11.354
only to cancel it again!

17:11.389 --> 17:14.389
I'll just make the party another
day when you're not too busy.

17:14.425 --> 17:16.650
Or will I? Who knows?
It'll be a surprise!

17:18.763 --> 17:20.705
Well, she took that well.

17:20.707 --> 17:22.823
Alright, pack your gear.
We're heading to Bung Hill.

17:22.859 --> 17:25.543
We're headed to Bung Hill.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.144
And if anybody gets in our way...

17:27.179 --> 17:31.081
They're going to be sorry
they got in our way.

17:31.116 --> 17:34.943
You're a little, evil,
no good, psycho girl.

17:34.979 --> 17:36.587
I'm so proud of you.

17:51.253 --> 17:52.979
Whoa!

17:53.014 --> 17:55.857
( Whistling )

17:55.892 --> 17:58.743
You see that?

17:58.778 --> 18:01.704
Hidey-ho, there, Bung Hillian!

18:01.739 --> 18:03.049
My family and I
are from out of town...

18:03.073 --> 18:05.215
We live in Toledo, Ohio

18:05.251 --> 18:08.311
and we're on our way
to Williamsburg, Virginia.

18:08.346 --> 18:10.705
You know, where they churn
butter the old-fashioned way.

18:10.740 --> 18:13.532
With a churner!

18:13.568 --> 18:15.037
All right, that's enough
out of you, Sparky.

18:15.061 --> 18:16.986
( Forced chuckle )

18:17.021 --> 18:19.179
Anyway, as I was saying,
we're lost.

18:19.214 --> 18:21.857
I can't find Route 60.

18:21.892 --> 18:23.954
Now I've misplaced a lot of
things in my day, by golly,

18:23.978 --> 18:27.530
but never a highway!

18:27.565 --> 18:29.802
Think maybe you can help me out? I've
got my map here. It's in my fanny pack.

18:29.826 --> 18:32.184
You ever seen...?

18:35.231 --> 18:37.915
Hey! I've been on my hog
for the past few hours.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.428
So what does it take to get a
little sarsaparilla around here?

18:39.452 --> 18:42.578
Travel back in time?

18:42.655 --> 18:47.183
Well, then I'll take a lemonade.
Make it a double.

18:47.218 --> 18:49.138
In the meantime, where's
the little biker's room?

18:59.639 --> 19:03.340
( Computer noises )

19:12.985 --> 19:15.219
( sighs )

19:15.255 --> 19:17.905
It's not really happening.
It's not really happening.

19:17.940 --> 19:19.857
It's not really Abby.

19:26.549 --> 19:28.407
Oh, who am I kidding?
That is definitely Abby.

19:33.489 --> 19:35.864
K.C., you'll blow your cover.
What are you doing?

19:35.899 --> 19:38.236
Mom, I just saw Abby. I'm not crazy
and I'm not letting her get away!

19:38.260 --> 19:39.460
( Sighs )

19:41.872 --> 19:44.565
( revs engine )

19:44.600 --> 19:46.074
( groans )

19:46.110 --> 19:49.753
( clears throat )

19:49.788 --> 19:52.228
Hey, man, nice skins, but I'm
gonna need to borrow your beast.

19:53.750 --> 19:54.750
Please?

19:55.794 --> 19:57.569
Alright.

19:57.605 --> 20:01.941
( Grunting )

20:03.244 --> 20:05.110
Whoo. Okay.

20:08.324 --> 20:10.764
Hey, bro. Nice skins, but I'm
gonna need to borrow your beast.

20:16.991 --> 20:18.916
( Revs engine )

20:18.951 --> 20:20.751
¶

20:34.233 --> 20:35.933
Hey, cuz.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.835
( Groans ) I knew
it was you all along!

20:37.870 --> 20:38.794
You made me think
that I lost it.

20:38.830 --> 20:40.271
You never had it.

20:43.325 --> 20:46.744
You'll never catch me, because
I'm smarter and better than you.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.396
Wow, for someone
with such a big head,

20:49.432 --> 20:50.892
I'm surprised you found
a helmet big enough to fit it!

20:50.916 --> 20:53.325
( Groans )

21:19.778 --> 21:21.554
( grunts )

21:21.589 --> 21:23.989
Oh, goodie. You're alive.

21:24.024 --> 21:26.175
( Groans ) Nice breath.

21:26.210 --> 21:28.018
No wonder you don't
have a boyfriend.

21:28.054 --> 21:30.837
I don't have a boyfriend
because you tried to kill him!

21:30.873 --> 21:34.141
I hate you! I hate you! I...
( muffled shouting )

21:34.177 --> 21:36.368
Oh, look at that.

21:36.403 --> 21:38.353
These stress balls
really are a great way

21:38.388 --> 21:39.663
to deal with your problems.

21:45.196 --> 21:47.705
They got our girl.
They got our girl.

21:47.740 --> 21:50.766
Don't worry. We'll get her back.

21:50.801 --> 21:53.986
Yeah, they're not
getting away with this.

21:54.021 --> 21:56.013
At least not alive.

22:00.528 --> 22:02.903
Woman:<i> Rob, your name's on TV.</i>
