00:10.167 --> 00:12.417
<i>A young soldier, about your age,</i>

00:12.500 --> 00:16.125
<i>far away from home,
discovers that he's growing horns.</i>

00:16.207 --> 00:19.792
<i>A troubling yet very common occurrence
in the Europe of his day.</i>

00:21.375 --> 00:25.333
<i>"Friend, thou art plagued,"
his comrades said about his horns.</i>

00:25.417 --> 00:28.042
<i>"Thy wife cheats on thee
with another dude."</i>

00:29.167 --> 00:31.875
<i>The other soldiers
spent days taunting him:</i>

00:31.958 --> 00:34.542
<i>"Yep. He's attacking her pink fortress.</i>

00:34.875 --> 00:36.875
<i>Doing the pants-off dance-off.</i>

00:37.000 --> 00:39.958
<i>Laying pipe. Tapping that ass."</i>

00:41.375 --> 00:44.250
<i>Humiliated and determined
to know the truth,</i>

00:44.333 --> 00:47.417
<i>he embarks on the long
and sleepless journey home.</i>

00:47.500 --> 00:50.958
<i>It's also hard to sleep
when you've got horns on your head. Yeah.</i>

00:51.792 --> 00:55.000
<i>Crying oceans,
he would scream to the heavens,</i>

00:55.083 --> 01:00.375
<i>"Gods of long-distance relationships,
why do you forsake me so?"</i>

01:00.458 --> 01:03.042
<i>It was sad. Heartbreaking stuff.</i>

01:06.625 --> 01:10.042
<i>He finally arrives at his homestead
to find his wife engaged</i>

01:10.125 --> 01:14.083
<i>in the four-legged foxtrot
with a rather handsome Moor.</i>

01:14.333 --> 01:16.875
<i>He'd never seen a Moor before, actually.</i>

01:18.375 --> 01:21.333
<i>Enraged, the young soldier slew the Moor</i>

01:21.417 --> 01:25.792
<i>and decided at that moment
never to trust dark-skinned fellows ever.</i>

01:26.583 --> 01:29.625
<i>As punishment,
and also to avoid future cuckolding,</i>

01:29.708 --> 01:32.750
<i>he shut his lady's cookie
with lock and key,</i>

01:33.250 --> 01:35.500
<i>making her penis-proof.</i>

01:35.583 --> 01:39.000
<i>Well, you have to understand, people,
this was the pre-woke era.</i>

01:39.083 --> 01:42.417
<i>She was his property. And you know
what they say in the suburbs:</i>

01:42.500 --> 01:45.417
<i>"Lock your stuff away
from the dark-skinned folks."</i>

01:46.625 --> 01:49.583
<i>Hey, what did I say
about phones in the class?</i>

01:49.667 --> 01:53.625
Come on, Mr. Richard.
We're in the middle of a narrative here.

01:53.708 --> 01:55.375
You guys get the gist, right?

01:55.458 --> 02:01.667
So, tomorrow and the rest of the week,
we will listen to your stories.

02:01.750 --> 02:03.417
Please try not to put us to sleep.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.792
- Be awesome.
- Great lecture.

02:05.875 --> 02:08.000
Happy birthday by the way, Mr. Matshane.

02:08.083 --> 02:10.667
Mr. Matshane is my dad.
Call me Max, please.

AFRICAN CUISINE

02:42.875 --> 02:45.958
- You guys need to hear this.
- Babe, are you...

02:46.042 --> 02:47.625
- Are you okay with it?
- I'm fine.

02:47.708 --> 02:51.083
- But you're sensitive about this.
- Don't be saying I'm sensitive.

02:52.000 --> 02:53.750
I'm not sensitive about this.

02:53.833 --> 02:55.917
- Are you sure?
- I'm sure. Tell the story.

02:56.000 --> 02:57.333
Okay, let me tell the story.

02:57.417 --> 03:00.458
So, the other day, it was a few days ago,

03:00.542 --> 03:02.375
we were in Parkhurst,
minding our business,

03:02.458 --> 03:05.000
having a great time,
and then we bump into this couple.

03:05.083 --> 03:07.333
- Friends of his.
- No, not my friends.

03:07.417 --> 03:09.750
- Matthew Fink and his wife.
- The journalist.

03:09.833 --> 03:11.125
- Right.
- I know that guy.

03:11.208 --> 03:15.750
They then ply us with alcohol
and they invite us to their house.

03:16.167 --> 03:21.000
So we're completely wasted,
and then they say, "Let's go for a swim."

03:21.792 --> 03:23.083
You went for a swim?

03:23.167 --> 03:27.583
No, we considered going for a swim
until they stood in front of us naked.

03:28.167 --> 03:30.792
So, he's like, "We have an early morning.

03:30.875 --> 03:32.333
- We have to go."
- Which I did.

03:32.417 --> 03:36.000
That's when they got to the point
of saying, "Cool, you can go.

03:36.083 --> 03:38.292
We'll bring your wife back
in the morning."

03:38.375 --> 03:41.000
They said that.
"We'll bring your wife in the morning."

03:42.542 --> 03:46.167
- But that is obvious, though.
- What do you mean?

03:46.250 --> 03:48.708
Dude, I've seen your life.

03:48.792 --> 03:52.500
I was there when you were picking up
those funny girls in high school, bro.

03:53.292 --> 03:56.875
Ain't none of them being invited
into a foursome. Not one of them.

03:56.958 --> 04:00.833
Based on this information, we can deduce
that you have never been invited

04:00.917 --> 04:03.917
to be part of a sexual encounter
involving more than two people.

04:04.750 --> 04:05.792
Like...

04:08.458 --> 04:10.250
- No.
- I think your brother is saying

04:10.333 --> 04:12.208
you're punching above
your weight with Sam.

04:12.792 --> 04:14.542
That is not what I'm saying at all.

04:18.625 --> 04:22.875
- I think you're completely orgy material.
- That's me.

04:22.958 --> 04:26.625
- It's so hard to meet women in the city.
- Sure you've tried hard enough?

04:27.208 --> 04:29.625
There aren't enough places to congregate.

04:29.708 --> 04:33.208
- Everyone is always in their cars.
- "Congregate"? Who says "congregate"?

04:33.292 --> 04:34.875
What's wrong with "congregate"?

04:46.958 --> 04:48.333
Fuck, I'm old.

04:50.583 --> 04:51.583
Toast.

04:51.958 --> 04:53.375
Let's raise our glasses.

04:53.458 --> 04:57.667
To the birthday boy, my brother,
Vladimir Matshane.

04:57.750 --> 04:59.958
Or Max, as you all know him.

05:00.042 --> 05:04.417
Sir, may you have many, many more
orgy invitations thanks to your wife.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.167
What an asshole.

05:15.458 --> 05:17.000
Are you Monsieur Bon Bon?

05:17.375 --> 05:19.833
- I just happen to be that exact person.
- Amazing.

05:19.917 --> 05:21.292
How can I be of assistance?

05:24.125 --> 05:27.917
- He's huge.
- She speaks. Welcome.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.500
Welcome to the table.

05:30.833 --> 05:33.958
He is huge, right?
Don't mind him, he's just jealous.

05:35.583 --> 05:40.208
Heiner Miller is coming to town.
Are you literary types excited?

05:40.292 --> 05:42.917
- Not me.
- Not you? What do you mean?

05:43.000 --> 05:44.708
You loved <i>Son of a Scorched Soil.</i>

05:44.792 --> 05:48.500
No. You said it was a great book,
I thought it was just okay.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.958
A little bit of jealousy here, Sam?

05:51.042 --> 05:54.500
Why would I be jealous?
The guy's like 80 years older than me.

05:54.583 --> 05:57.625
- Why would I be jealous?
- He isn't that old, is he?

05:57.708 --> 05:58.958
He's very old.

05:59.042 --> 06:01.708
I'm not the literary type and I'm excited.

06:01.792 --> 06:05.250
- I've got a first edition of <i>Mighty Zungu.</i>
- I love that book.

06:05.333 --> 06:07.458
Somebody needs to make a movie of that.

06:07.542 --> 06:10.500
- I've never read it.
- What? How old are you?

06:22.625 --> 06:26.875
We invited everybody.
It's only proper that we get you guys.

06:26.958 --> 06:29.292
This is my birthday gift to myself.

06:29.375 --> 06:31.625
- To everybody.
- We could just split this.

06:31.708 --> 06:33.583
No, just relax. I've got this.

06:34.750 --> 06:36.542
- Thank you.
- Something for my friends.

06:36.625 --> 06:37.667
Thank you.

06:41.000 --> 06:43.333
- Declined.
- Try budget.

06:48.042 --> 06:52.708
I don't mind splitting it.
Although, we didn't have any booze.

06:53.542 --> 06:56.083
And then? What happened to the party?

06:58.917 --> 06:59.833
I'll take it.

07:03.333 --> 07:05.500
Thanks. Little brother.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.500
- Happy birthday, my love.
- Yeah.

07:17.042 --> 07:18.250
Bye now. Hello?

07:18.958 --> 07:22.625
- Her book launch?
- Yes, baby, you know about this. Poetry.

07:23.875 --> 07:27.250
You know the world should not be exposed
to that lady's poetry.

07:27.333 --> 07:30.958
Her poetry is horrible.
I don't want to go to the poetry...

07:31.042 --> 07:34.375
- That's a terrible thing to say.
- No, you know I love Laz.

07:34.458 --> 07:36.417
I love Laz more than I love myself.

07:36.500 --> 07:38.750
You love Laz more than you love yourself?

07:40.083 --> 07:42.958
Like I love myself.
Yeah, I love her a lot.

07:43.042 --> 07:46.208
If you love her like you love yourself,
how much do you love me?

07:46.292 --> 07:49.875
I love you, like,
more than I love everything.

07:50.000 --> 07:51.333
I love you infinity.

07:51.708 --> 07:54.458
I love you like ten thousands Lazes.

07:54.542 --> 07:55.833
A million Lazes.

08:24.125 --> 08:25.125
<i>Sam?</i>

08:26.667 --> 08:29.958
- I think we've got money problems.
- Yeah, I know.

08:30.042 --> 08:32.500
We've got so much of it
that you decided you want to

08:32.582 --> 08:35.292
settle a 4,000 rand bill, remember?

08:35.375 --> 08:40.082
I'm an idiot, I know.
I think my ego got the better of me.

08:40.207 --> 08:42.542
You know what my solution is.
Ive told you this

08:42.625 --> 08:45.333
We could just sell this place
and get a smaller place.

08:45.417 --> 08:47.708
There are such cool apartments
in Killarney.

08:47.792 --> 08:50.000
But... we love this place.

08:50.083 --> 08:51.958
This is our place to have kids
and grow old.

08:52.542 --> 08:55.583
People have babies all over the place,
all around the world.

08:55.667 --> 08:59.083
Could have a baby in a mud hut.
Plus, I'm not in a rush to have children.

08:59.167 --> 09:00.958
I spent my teens raising my brother.

09:03.458 --> 09:06.625
I curse your brother.
Your brother's costing me a family.

09:06.708 --> 09:08.292
Leave my brother, stop it.

09:09.167 --> 09:12.625
I'm sorry.
But we're not getting any younger.

09:12.875 --> 09:16.083
- And I thought you loved this place.
- I do.

09:16.167 --> 09:18.917
I think we could use our money
to do something else,

09:19.000 --> 09:22.583
something different,
not just a house in the suburbs.

09:23.375 --> 09:26.583
- I've got that series of talks at UCT.
- Yeah.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.125
It's a good check. Piss easy.

09:29.750 --> 09:33.208
Could use the money
to squash the overdraft.

09:33.792 --> 09:37.208
"Head above water" vibes.
That's so romantic.

09:37.292 --> 09:42.000
We should be flying to somewhere exotic
like India or South America,

09:42.083 --> 09:47.667
have magic mushrooms,
run away naked in faraway forests.

09:47.750 --> 09:50.167
You can focus on your writing.

09:50.250 --> 09:53.417
And then we can talk about babies
and a big house.

09:53.500 --> 09:55.708
We'll be deep in our 40s by then.

09:55.792 --> 09:58.125
We'll have babies
that we take out to the shops

09:58.208 --> 10:02.375
and everybody will be going, "Oh, wow.
What cute grandchildren you have.

10:02.458 --> 10:04.333
What cute grandchildren."

10:04.417 --> 10:07.542
- Anyway, guess what I'm doing this week.
- What?

10:07.625 --> 10:10.000
I finally got that interview
with Herbert Gwala.

10:10.708 --> 10:11.792
Wow, well done!

10:13.000 --> 10:16.458
- I was hassling his people for two months.
- I know, I was here.

10:17.042 --> 10:18.958
I was here when you were hassling there.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.917
They finally agreed. I'm meeting him
at his house for the interview.

10:23.458 --> 10:24.292
His house?

10:25.833 --> 10:28.958
No. He's gonna try to shag you. Obviously.

10:29.042 --> 10:32.125
You know, I was reading up about him.
He's an alchemist.

10:32.208 --> 10:35.000
He turns women into wives and fuckbuddies.

10:35.083 --> 10:36.958
He's gonna totally try to shag you.

10:37.042 --> 10:41.750
I could just whore myself to him
for a couple of million, Max.

10:41.833 --> 10:44.792
You never know.
He'll say, "Oh, here, babies.

10:44.875 --> 10:47.875
Here's a diamond mine.
Can I fuck you now?"

10:47.958 --> 10:52.042
Then I say, "Yes, Pootie.
Diamonds are a girl's best friend."

10:52.125 --> 10:54.333
That's the spirit.

10:54.417 --> 10:57.458
Taking one for the team.
Squashing overdrafts.

10:58.292 --> 11:01.125
Yeah, right. You should get going. Okay.

11:01.208 --> 11:04.333
- Love you.
- Get out of here.

11:04.417 --> 11:06.625
Get out of here, you diamond mine whore.

11:07.417 --> 11:09.875
I'm putting money into a microbrewery
with some students.

11:09.958 --> 11:11.667
- You interested?
- No.

11:12.208 --> 11:14.542
Sounds like hipster nonsense.

11:15.083 --> 11:18.083
Quickest way to lose your cash.
And you know nothing about beer.

11:18.958 --> 11:21.250
Besides, money's pretty tight in my life.

11:22.167 --> 11:24.917
- Might even have to sell the house.
- That's heavy.

11:25.000 --> 11:28.208
- Why not ask your brother to bail you out?
- No.

11:28.292 --> 11:30.917
You're crazy. I'm not asking
my little brother for cash.

11:31.375 --> 11:32.208
Are you serious?

11:32.292 --> 11:34.417
I don't think you comprehend
how big he is.

11:34.500 --> 11:38.542
<i>Rolling Stone</i> have him on their list
of most promising acts of the year.

11:38.833 --> 11:41.167
Is it local <i>Rolling Stone</i> ? It must be.

11:41.250 --> 11:44.500
Hating on your own blood?
No. Hating on your own blood?

11:46.083 --> 11:48.417
Write another book.
You'll get a fat advance.

11:48.500 --> 11:49.750
Everything will be sorted.

11:51.958 --> 11:55.042
- It's a local <i>Rolling Stone, </i> right?
- What difference does it make?

11:55.125 --> 11:57.667
And as the sun was setting,

11:57.750 --> 12:00.625
casting a golden glow over the garrison,

12:00.708 --> 12:04.083
he emerged from the hole covered in dust,

12:04.208 --> 12:06.583
carrying her lifeless body.

12:07.792 --> 12:09.083
He dropped the body.

12:09.542 --> 12:12.250
He turned to them
and he said what he had said before.

12:12.333 --> 12:13.625
He cocked his Glock,

12:14.333 --> 12:18.208
and he said, "Let this be a lesson
to all y'all swarm of bitches.

12:18.708 --> 12:21.292
I said this before.
I'm gonna say it again.

12:21.417 --> 12:23.583
You can't make a ho a housewife.

12:24.125 --> 12:28.375
And if any of y'all beg to differ,
you can suck on these nuts."

12:29.083 --> 12:30.042
Boom!

12:33.958 --> 12:35.042
Thanks.

12:35.458 --> 12:37.792
Thanks, Mr. Edwards. That was...

12:38.500 --> 12:40.542
expletive-ridden to say the least.

12:41.250 --> 12:45.250
And there's a complete looting
of Hollywood lines and...

12:45.542 --> 12:47.542
verses from rap songs.

12:48.125 --> 12:51.583
The piece is meant to be an adaptation
of various things

12:51.667 --> 12:53.292
which serve the same theme.

12:53.375 --> 12:55.542
Like a meta-adaptation, if you may.

12:56.250 --> 12:57.208
Okay.

12:57.917 --> 12:59.375
What does everybody else think?

13:01.375 --> 13:04.042
- Mr. Khumalo, take it away.
- You know...

13:04.792 --> 13:06.667
I'm offended. You know?

13:06.792 --> 13:09.375
The rampant use of the N word.

13:09.500 --> 13:11.042
N word this, N word that.

13:11.125 --> 13:12.875
It's an N word festival in here.

13:12.958 --> 13:15.833
- What's happening?
- That was used in context, I assure you.

13:15.917 --> 13:17.583
These characters would say that.

13:19.083 --> 13:21.500
Anybody else?
Ms. Mogale, what do you think?

13:22.167 --> 13:24.333
Ms. Mogale's my mother. It's Kabelo.

13:25.583 --> 13:26.417
Touché.

13:27.708 --> 13:29.417
What did you think, Kabelo?

13:30.500 --> 13:31.583
I thought it sucks.

13:31.667 --> 13:34.708
Is that all we're going to get? It sucked?

13:35.833 --> 13:39.542
It's just such an obvious example
of cultural appropriation,

13:39.625 --> 13:41.375
with no sense of irony.

13:41.458 --> 13:44.542
It's like you thought we'd forget
that you're a white male

13:44.625 --> 13:47.167
using your privilege
to exploit black culture.

13:47.583 --> 13:49.500
I'm mean... it's unacceptable.

13:49.583 --> 13:53.500
While taking liberties to drop a few
N bombs here and there. We see you.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.333
All right, cool.
Let's pick on the white guy, right?

13:56.417 --> 13:57.958
Let's pick on the white guy.

13:58.875 --> 14:02.583
Okay, guys. Let's pick it up next time.
Thank you very much.

14:09.958 --> 14:13.333
Mr. Matshane. Sorry, I mean, Max.

14:13.583 --> 14:17.542
I wanted to say that <i>Blossoms of the Roses</i>
is my favorite book.

14:17.625 --> 14:19.875
It's the reason
I wanted to become a writer.

14:20.375 --> 14:24.833
Just really beautiful and layered
and kind of amazing.

14:25.250 --> 14:26.958
Thanks, I appreciate that.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.792
This is something I've been working on
for a while now.

14:30.875 --> 14:34.500
- All right.
- Your feedback would mean everything.

14:34.792 --> 14:36.542
- Do you mind reading it?
- Of course.

14:36.625 --> 14:40.167
- I'll read it and get back to you.
- Thank you.

14:40.292 --> 14:44.125
- It's quite big. There's a lot.
- Well, I write a lot.

14:44.208 --> 14:47.542
- Okay.
- Well, thanks and everything.

14:50.583 --> 14:52.458
Are you going to the Heiner Miller talk?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.833
- I might.
- So maybe I'll see you there?

14:58.375 --> 14:59.250
Okay.

15:00.250 --> 15:01.125
Okay, bye.

15:04.458 --> 15:09.042
Do you think that the N word
in South Africa is as offensive?

15:09.125 --> 15:12.042
If you heard a white person say it,

15:12.125 --> 15:14.250
would you be offended

15:14.333 --> 15:16.542
or would you think
they're trying to be down?

15:16.625 --> 15:18.708
- Well, it depends.
- On what?

15:18.792 --> 15:21.583
If a white guy came up to me and said,
"What's up my nigga?"

15:22.167 --> 15:23.958
I'd be annoyed, but I'd let it slide.

15:24.042 --> 15:27.042
But if I overheard him say,
"There are too many niggas in here,"

15:27.125 --> 15:29.000
I'd be compelled to punch him.

15:29.375 --> 15:32.667
But would it rouse as strong an emotion
as the K word?

15:32.750 --> 15:35.250
No. The K word is completely off-limits.

15:35.333 --> 15:38.750
There is no justifiable reason for anyone,
black or white,

15:39.125 --> 15:40.583
to use the K word.

15:42.667 --> 15:45.583
- I'm way too horny for this place.
- Tell me about it.

15:45.667 --> 15:49.792
What do you mean? You get to have
regular intercourse with a hot woman.

15:49.875 --> 15:52.875
I know, but the girl in my class there...

15:53.208 --> 15:55.583
We're talking belter extraordinaire.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.250
She smells so good.

15:57.333 --> 16:02.375
When she was standing next to me,
I literally had a semi-erect penis.

16:03.625 --> 16:07.417
If she said, "Let's do it right now,
in the library," I'd be conflicted.

16:07.500 --> 16:10.042
But let me take this moment to remind you

16:10.125 --> 16:13.375
of how our dear friend and comrade
Lennox Papo

16:13.625 --> 16:16.708
was busted from this place
for succumbing to the loins...

16:17.250 --> 16:20.125
not even the loins,
the juicy loins, of his students.

16:20.208 --> 16:25.042
- Don't forget Lennox Papo.
- Yeah. I'll never cheat on my wife.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.000
Especially with a student. No.

16:27.167 --> 16:28.875
Yeah, but you had location just now.

16:28.958 --> 16:32.667
Yeah, it's hypothetical.
But Lennox though.

16:32.750 --> 16:34.917
- Lennox.
- Lennox was too reckless.

16:35.000 --> 16:41.000
I am overwhelmed with the warm reception
back in the country of my birth.

16:41.917 --> 16:46.958
And also to see the talent and enthusiasm
that still lives and works here.

16:47.958 --> 16:52.500
You wouldn't think so to look at me
with my rugged looks and sexy physique.

16:53.625 --> 16:55.500
I am actually quite old.

16:55.917 --> 17:00.375
So, I'd be very happy if I've been able
to inspire at least some of you

17:00.458 --> 17:02.542
to follow your creative paths.

17:03.292 --> 17:04.458
Because...

17:05.041 --> 17:08.916
- What do you think of this guy?
- He's lived, man. We're sleeping.

17:10.875 --> 17:12.833
I'm just tired of this bleeding heart,

17:12.916 --> 17:15.875
white liberal view
on the "African plight."

17:15.958 --> 17:17.625
It's so condescending, Man.

17:17.708 --> 17:20.166
What you said right there,
I'm tired of that.

17:20.250 --> 17:23.166
That is tired.
This guy's got the Booker Prize.

17:23.625 --> 17:27.791
Yeah, but when his freedom came,
why did he run off to Australia?

17:28.250 --> 17:29.500
Come on.

17:29.583 --> 17:32.583
Gonna give yourself a heart attack
with all this hating.

17:32.958 --> 17:34.250
Not hating, it's just...

17:34.333 --> 17:36.333
You were given a gut.

17:36.792 --> 17:39.542
Now you need to trust that fucking gut.

17:41.167 --> 17:45.167
Because that,
combined with a capacity for hard work,

17:45.250 --> 17:47.417
is the only thing
that you are going to need.

17:49.958 --> 17:52.125
I thought he said he was finishing.

17:52.208 --> 17:54.542
Or a PhD in Creativity.

17:56.583 --> 17:57.625
So go, create!

18:04.792 --> 18:05.792
Unbelievable.

18:09.750 --> 18:12.292
Unbelievable.

18:18.167 --> 18:21.833
- Do we really have to do this?
- I want to. You can wait outside.

18:24.458 --> 18:29.000
So I told you about Sam's thing
that I'm going to tonight.

18:29.708 --> 18:30.792
What is it?

18:30.875 --> 18:33.958
Some painter's wife
is having a fundraiser.

18:34.583 --> 18:38.583
And you know how it is with Sam,
she's a proper social butterfly.

18:38.917 --> 18:41.542
So I'm essentially going to be on my own.

18:42.417 --> 18:44.875
So I'm extending you an invitation.

18:44.958 --> 18:47.917
Last night was heavy, man.
I want to have an early night,

18:48.000 --> 18:51.875
- get some sleep.
- There'll be single women.

18:56.750 --> 18:57.583
Sorry.

18:59.042 --> 19:00.708
- Want to meet the big guy?
- Yes.

19:02.250 --> 19:04.833
Heiner, sorry,
I want to introduce you to someone.

19:04.917 --> 19:07.292
This Max Matshane,
also in the English Department.

19:07.375 --> 19:09.417
He does Creative Writing
with the postgrads.

19:09.542 --> 19:11.792
- Big fan.
- I've heard that name.

19:11.875 --> 19:13.333
<i>Blossom of the Roses.</i>

19:13.833 --> 19:14.792
Yes.

19:14.875 --> 19:17.375
I make it a point to seek out
promising African writers.

19:17.458 --> 19:18.958
Are you working on something?

19:19.042 --> 19:22.125
I just want to say what an honor it is
to be in the presence

19:22.208 --> 19:23.417
of a literary giant.

19:23.500 --> 19:24.583
Well, thanks.

19:25.000 --> 19:28.792
This is a moment to behold.
You've made us proud. Very proud.

19:31.875 --> 19:34.417
- Shall I...?
- Oh, please, yeah.

19:38.583 --> 19:40.500
- Thanks, Clive.
- Sure, Joel.

19:40.583 --> 19:43.708
- Thank you. To Joel, yeah.
- J...

19:43.792 --> 19:46.625
"J-O..." I mean, yeah.

19:47.958 --> 19:50.083
- Thank you. Good luck.
- Thank you so much.

19:50.167 --> 19:52.833
Thank you and I hope you enjoy your stay.

19:52.917 --> 19:55.667
- No, I will.
- Thank you very much.

19:55.750 --> 19:56.917
Nice.

19:57.000 --> 20:00.333
I'll see you.
Thanks, Max, thanks for coming through.

20:01.750 --> 20:03.708
Sorry.

20:04.833 --> 20:10.083
You might want to wipe that poo
off your lips, from all that ass-licking.

20:11.167 --> 20:12.583
"I read your book.

20:13.417 --> 20:15.417
You've made us proud."

20:15.500 --> 20:17.542
What the hell? "You've made us proud."

20:17.625 --> 20:20.833
Giving props to an African writer.
Giving props where props are due.

20:21.000 --> 20:23.542
But he... he read my book.

20:37.667 --> 20:38.500
Hey.

20:39.667 --> 20:44.250
Wow, babe. I really love Braam.
We should get a place here and stay here.

20:44.333 --> 20:45.500
I don't know.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.625
I don't know. It's just...

20:48.708 --> 20:51.917
I just hate the fact that
just a few years ago,

20:52.000 --> 20:54.292
white people were too scared
to come out here,

20:54.375 --> 20:58.125
and now they're out here overcharging us
for steaks and real estate.

20:58.208 --> 20:59.333
It's not right, man.

20:59.417 --> 21:02.542
Why must you racialize everything?
It's so unnecessary.

21:02.625 --> 21:04.875
I racialize everything
because I'm South African.

21:04.958 --> 21:08.167
It's my culture. It's how I was made.

21:10.625 --> 21:11.667
Sure, sure.

21:14.083 --> 21:15.625
I think I have some change.

21:17.958 --> 21:20.667
Twenty rand? No. Wait.

21:21.917 --> 21:24.750
- Max. Just give it to him.
- Are you crazy? No.

21:26.792 --> 21:29.792
Why are you giving him 20 bucks?
What's wrong with you?

21:29.875 --> 21:32.708
You think you're helping
but he'll buy glue with that money.

21:32.792 --> 21:35.292
He's gonna buy tik and stuff like that.

21:35.375 --> 21:39.833
Trust me. You're nice, we appreciate you,
but there you are not helping.

21:49.208 --> 21:53.083
- So this guy was given a black child.
- What?

21:53.167 --> 21:57.125
- Your wife cheated with a black guy?
- No, no.

21:57.792 --> 22:01.625
You remember how, before we got pregnant,
we were going to adopt?

22:02.000 --> 22:05.417
Well, that process continued
and we didn't want to stop it.

22:05.500 --> 22:08.542
You didn't want to stop it
or you couldn't stop it?

22:08.625 --> 22:10.167
No, we didn't want to stop it.

22:11.042 --> 22:16.000
Really? I know how hard it was
for you guys to get pregnant.

22:16.333 --> 22:22.125
And did it not cross your mind, like,
"We're having a proper white baby now.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.583
We don't need this other one"?

22:24.917 --> 22:28.333
- Why would you say that?
- We're just talking. I'm just asking.

22:28.417 --> 22:30.417
You know what, fuck you.

22:31.208 --> 22:34.917
I'm going to hang with other people.
Good luck with this asshole.

22:35.000 --> 22:38.000
- No. Miles.
- What's wrong with you?

22:39.250 --> 22:42.917
- What's wrong with you?
- I think he took it a bit too personally.

22:43.792 --> 22:46.792
- I mean...
- But seriously though.

22:47.792 --> 22:50.125
Seriously, why is it always that, like,

22:50.208 --> 22:52.917
white people are always adopting
black babies?

22:53.000 --> 22:57.458
- So what? We must all stick to our own?
- No, on the contrary,

22:57.542 --> 23:01.375
I'm just looking out for
all those impoverished white babies

23:01.458 --> 23:04.917
that are always overlooked
by billionaire celebrities

23:05.000 --> 23:08.083
going for the babies of other cultures
or other races.

23:08.667 --> 23:11.167
- Vietnamese babies, Indian babies.
- I think...

23:11.250 --> 23:15.875
You'll find there's a long waiting list
for white babies. I've looked into it.

23:15.958 --> 23:19.417
Are you telling me
that white babies are quite rare?

23:19.500 --> 23:22.333
Impoverished white babies
are like diamond babies.

23:25.500 --> 23:27.167
What do you think of this place?

23:28.250 --> 23:29.500
Too Joburg.

23:30.292 --> 23:33.333
And I hate it when people ask you
what you do

23:33.417 --> 23:37.542
and as soon as they realize
you don't make a million bucks a second,

23:37.625 --> 23:40.625
you see their eyes drifting off. You know?

23:41.167 --> 23:46.042
It's just... Do you know how many times
I've had conversations that end abruptly,

23:46.125 --> 23:48.417
as soon as I say I teach English?

23:48.500 --> 23:51.708
Why don't you tell people you're a writer?
It's a bit more sexy.

23:51.792 --> 23:57.208
Because I haven't written in a long time.
It feels like I'm an impostor.

23:57.292 --> 24:02.208
Here's the thing. I'm having a good time.
Please contain your negative vibes.

24:02.292 --> 24:05.750
- Women can sense negative vibes.
- What negative vibes?

24:06.292 --> 24:08.875
These negative vibes.
"I haven't written in a long time.

24:08.958 --> 24:11.333
I teach English." Just keep it contained.

24:11.417 --> 24:14.333
- All right. Okay. Cheers.
- Okay?

24:14.417 --> 24:15.500
Yeah?

24:15.583 --> 24:18.792
You see, there.
She looks like she's having a great time.

24:18.875 --> 24:20.708
She's always having a great time.

24:25.000 --> 24:28.417
It's none of my business, but I bet
you have to keep her happy in bed.

24:28.500 --> 24:32.458
- I never go down on women, but I bet you...
- None of your business.

24:32.542 --> 24:35.083
- It might become my business.
- I wouldn't. Never.

24:35.167 --> 24:37.000
So, this is my husband.

24:38.000 --> 24:40.417
Your husband.
I've heard so much about you. Max.

24:40.875 --> 24:43.333
- What is it you do?
- I'm a writer.

24:43.417 --> 24:46.083
You have to meet my husband,
he's an avid reader.

24:46.167 --> 24:49.417
- You two would just hit it off.
- I can imagine.

24:49.833 --> 24:51.083
And this is Joel.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.917
Hello, Joel. What is it that you do?

24:55.000 --> 24:56.250
I'm an economist.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.125
An economist, wow. Tell me more.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.792
See? It's like rock, paper, scissors.

25:03.500 --> 25:08.458
- Economist beats writer.
- No, that's not true.

25:08.750 --> 25:09.958
Look, listen.

25:10.042 --> 25:12.375
- Do you want to have a joint?
- You have one?

25:13.875 --> 25:16.292
- What's he got?
- Let's squeeze out.

25:16.375 --> 25:19.583
Don't ask me. All number of books
on things mathematical

25:19.667 --> 25:21.125
I don't really care about.

25:21.208 --> 25:24.000
But Joel, have you met everyone?

25:28.458 --> 25:30.750
- Wow.
- Let me give you the tour.

25:33.917 --> 25:35.417
Macroeconomics?

25:43.708 --> 25:44.542
YOLO.

26:16.292 --> 26:17.417
What are you doing?

26:46.667 --> 26:49.208
- No.
- Alcoholic breath.

26:50.375 --> 26:52.167
What... What right...

26:58.042 --> 27:01.833
- Relax. Please let me handle this.
- I think we should pay them.

27:01.917 --> 27:04.583
I am not paying a bribe. I refuse.

27:35.833 --> 27:37.208
Hey, I said I've got this.

27:37.792 --> 27:39.208
It's fine, officer.

27:44.792 --> 27:45.667
Sorry.

27:49.542 --> 27:53.458
- Do you mind not shining that in my face?
- Do you mind if I do my job?

27:54.375 --> 27:56.333
Know the penalty for drinking and driving?

27:56.417 --> 27:59.458
You can't arrest me for drunken driving
without a breathalyzer.

28:10.208 --> 28:12.042
Take him to the police station. Now.

28:22.917 --> 28:26.792
- Can you give me your full name, please?
- My full name?

28:26.875 --> 28:28.208
Suzet?

28:45.833 --> 28:46.667
What the fuck?

28:47.875 --> 28:49.292
- Just go.
- I said I'd handle it.

28:49.375 --> 28:50.250
Go!

28:51.167 --> 28:52.000
Fuck.

28:55.083 --> 28:56.250
Serious bullshit.

29:13.542 --> 29:14.917
Good morning.

29:18.917 --> 29:20.667
Babe, my head.

29:27.625 --> 29:30.542
- What are you watching?
- My brother's nonsense.

29:30.625 --> 29:33.500
Can you believe this has
eight million views?

29:34.375 --> 29:35.708
What the hell?

29:38.833 --> 29:40.083
Is that the new one?

29:42.583 --> 29:44.708
Yeah, it's pretty out there, right?

29:44.917 --> 29:50.625
Yeah I remember when I was the out there
one in the family.

29:51.833 --> 29:54.500
- You're still pretty out there.
- Thanks.

29:56.667 --> 29:57.750
Did we use a condom?

29:59.250 --> 30:04.708
- I think so. We always use condoms.
- What do you mean, you think so?

30:04.792 --> 30:10.292
Because we're the condom tribe.
The Durex shares are up because of us.

30:19.875 --> 30:24.083
You do know it's pretty lame
that we only bone when we're very drunk.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.042
Because sober sex is overrated.

30:28.125 --> 30:29.667
Sober sex...

30:29.750 --> 30:32.708
We used to have great sober sex
all the time.

30:32.792 --> 30:36.250
But then we also had awesome drunk sex.

30:37.333 --> 30:39.625
Really, was it "out there"? The sober sex?

30:39.708 --> 30:44.042
- It was really out there.
- Was it like "out there"?

30:44.125 --> 30:45.583
"Out there" out there?

30:46.792 --> 30:48.792
Sorry. Sorry.

31:05.208 --> 31:10.667
<i>But the truth is, I miss Johannesburg.
I love this city.</i>

31:10.750 --> 31:14.875
I can remember going drinking,
way back, with Grant Phiri.

31:14.958 --> 31:18.125
No way, Grant Phiri, Grant Phiri?
I used to work for his paper.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.042
The same.

31:19.125 --> 31:23.125
So we would stay there late night,
way past the curfew.

31:23.500 --> 31:27.083
And I would make sure that he was driving.

31:27.167 --> 31:31.292
So if the cops stopped us,
I'd say, "No, it's okay, he's my driver."

31:32.500 --> 31:35.583
Don't know how we got away with it.
We were driving this old Beetle.

31:35.667 --> 31:39.458
- We're both totally drunk.
- I cannot imagine Grant Phiri drunk.

31:39.583 --> 31:43.042
- He's so, kind of, serious.
- Seriously drunk.

31:43.917 --> 31:47.875
So tell me, you've never really spoken
about your reasons for leaving.

31:48.625 --> 31:49.792
Am I gonna get lucky?

31:51.583 --> 31:52.875
Well...

31:53.458 --> 31:55.625
Look, I think it's a pity

31:55.708 --> 31:58.625
that people see it
as me deserting the country.

32:00.000 --> 32:02.833
But in fact, it's true, partly.

32:03.458 --> 32:05.917
I could never relax.

32:06.000 --> 32:10.250
Always. The violence, the high walls,
the uncertainty.

32:11.042 --> 32:14.458
I can see at least one person
who doesn't approve of my reasons.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.042
Why don't you join us, Max.

32:19.167 --> 32:23.333
- No, I wouldn't want to intrude.
- You wouldn't be intruding at all.

32:23.417 --> 32:27.250
Trust me. Since I've been here,
everyone's been painfully nice.

32:27.417 --> 32:30.333
No offense, Nicole.
I'd appreciate some honesty.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.375
Come on.

32:34.500 --> 32:36.042
- Okay.
- Excellent.

32:37.833 --> 32:39.458
Think I can record him? Okay.

32:41.333 --> 32:43.917
Max Matshane, Nicole.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.208
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

32:45.292 --> 32:49.125
- I'm writing on post-colonial discourse.
- I thought you were a journalist.

32:49.208 --> 32:54.542
So, tell me some shit about myself.
I'm a narcissistic sucker for punishment.

32:54.625 --> 32:59.125
- Well, I couldn't help but overhear...
- I know, I speak loud, sorry!

33:15.250 --> 33:18.000
Look, I concede, I'm a hypocrite.

33:18.083 --> 33:21.833
The problem is,
everyone mistook me for a hero.

33:21.917 --> 33:24.667
The work might have been heroic,
but I can guarantee you

33:24.750 --> 33:29.000
I was drunk and high on any number
of substances during that time.

33:29.125 --> 33:34.208
I lived a unique existence in this country
but I lost a lot of friends here as well.

33:34.292 --> 33:36.833
- So you kind of ran away.
- I left.

33:36.917 --> 33:40.500
- Ran away is the appropriate term.
- I left fast.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.000
- Okay?
- There you go.

33:42.083 --> 33:46.625
But I look around me now at even bigger
idealists than methat stayed,

33:46.708 --> 33:48.250
and they've abandoned everything.

33:48.333 --> 33:50.250
They're busy raiding the public purse.

33:50.333 --> 33:53.750
I still think that the world I wrote about
in my first two novels

33:53.833 --> 33:56.417
- can be achieved, but...
- But you have none of it.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.792
I love the good life.

33:59.333 --> 34:02.583
Having sex with exotic women
on foreign beaches,

34:02.667 --> 34:06.042
wearing loose-fitting clothing
that do not constrain my movement.

34:06.125 --> 34:07.458
That's my thing.

34:08.083 --> 34:11.208
So when freedom came,
and instead of good times,

34:11.292 --> 34:14.083
people started hacking each other
with machetes,

34:14.167 --> 34:17.542
- I thought to myself...
- They can hack each other all they want.

34:17.625 --> 34:20.125
I'm going to run away to Australia.

34:20.208 --> 34:22.542
This place is going to the dogs.

34:22.625 --> 34:24.667
I guess you could say that, yes.

34:24.750 --> 34:26.875
Max, look at me. I'm a white guy.

34:26.958 --> 34:29.917
I looked at myself, I thought,
"I'm not gonna live forever."

34:30.500 --> 34:35.542
I'm going to enjoy this whiteness.
Plus, I'm rich and famous, so I can.

34:36.458 --> 34:41.542
- Am I hearing this correctly? Seriously?
- I'm gonna get me some white time.

34:42.667 --> 34:46.875
- Hey, I was banned.
- Yeah, don't we know that.

34:47.375 --> 34:50.750
It must be nice. Fighting apartheid
from privileged station.

34:50.875 --> 34:53.167
- Must be awesome. Must be so cool.
- Hey!

34:53.250 --> 34:57.167
I was banned, buddy.
That means it was illegal to be me.

34:57.292 --> 34:59.958
Well, welcome to the club, sir.

35:00.042 --> 35:02.292
Who feels like a shooter? Bit of a round?

35:02.375 --> 35:04.500
I can't fucking believe this guy.

35:06.958 --> 35:09.375
You know, I feel like
I know you so much better, Max.

35:09.458 --> 35:11.958
Yes, and I still think you're an asshole.

35:13.292 --> 35:15.583
I think I'm an asshole too.

35:16.625 --> 35:18.500
Max, why are you so angry?

35:19.042 --> 35:24.292
What does it matter what old white farts
like me do with our lives?

35:24.375 --> 35:26.500
You should be happy we're gone.

35:26.583 --> 35:29.625
Look, all these people,
different cultures, mingling.

35:29.708 --> 35:31.917
This is what people fought for.

35:32.375 --> 35:34.708
This is not a reflection of reality.

35:34.792 --> 35:40.833
This is a very tiny speck
of a very, very tiny speck of reality.

35:40.917 --> 35:45.750
In real life, black people are dirt-poor
and white people run everything.

35:45.833 --> 35:48.375
I still recommend a violent revolution.

35:49.042 --> 35:50.208
Please.

35:50.292 --> 35:53.458
- I'm going to leave. That pisses me off.
- It would.

35:53.542 --> 35:57.458
Where you going to go, New Zealand?
Bon voyage.

35:59.292 --> 36:00.708
Yeah, okay.

36:04.792 --> 36:05.958
Excuse me?

36:06.042 --> 36:08.833
You've been getting the wrong idea.
I am not that woman.

36:12.208 --> 36:15.542
- I am so sorry.
- I'm just playing with you.

36:18.667 --> 36:22.375
You need to relax.
Can we have one more shooter here?

36:23.958 --> 36:25.958
Vladimir Matshane.

36:30.375 --> 36:33.833
Max, you and me,
we are kindred spirits, brother.

36:33.917 --> 36:36.333
I look at you and I see myself.

36:36.417 --> 36:42.500
Well, a younger, less successful,
not quite as sexy...

36:43.000 --> 36:45.500
It's that attitude.

37:02.667 --> 37:03.625
Oh, man.

37:04.625 --> 37:07.583
What time did I get home? My head!

37:08.542 --> 37:14.292
You spent 1,200 rand

37:14.375 --> 37:16.625
at 2:30 in the morning at Kitcheners.

37:16.708 --> 37:19.417
I'd love to know who you were with
and how you got home.

37:20.000 --> 37:22.167
I think I must have driven.

37:22.792 --> 37:25.250
- I was with Heiner.
- Heiner Miller?

37:27.792 --> 37:29.917
- How is he?
- He's fine.

37:31.042 --> 37:33.292
No, I mean, like,
how is he as a person?

37:36.417 --> 37:38.250
1,200.

37:38.333 --> 37:42.542
These bank SMS's are killing the mystique.

37:42.625 --> 37:46.500
Now you'll never wonder
if I'm in some seedy hotel room

37:46.583 --> 37:48.875
being seduced by a youthful wench.

37:49.292 --> 37:51.333
- You'll never know.
- Babe.

37:51.417 --> 37:53.167
You give yourself way too much credit.

37:58.292 --> 38:00.833
How did I look? Do I look nice and thick?

38:01.500 --> 38:03.333
Wait, is thick a good thing?

38:03.417 --> 38:05.750
It is if you're interviewing
Herbert Gwala.

38:05.833 --> 38:11.042
- You had your youthful wench yesterday.
- So this is a... Okay.

38:11.167 --> 38:12.958
- Revenge.
- No, not revenge.

38:13.042 --> 38:17.333
I'm just going to earn back the money
that you spent yesterday,

38:17.417 --> 38:19.167
since we don't have much of it.

38:19.250 --> 38:22.417
And make sure you drink that stuff.
It's gonna make you feel better.

38:22.500 --> 38:24.917
And by the way, today I'm taking the car.

38:25.792 --> 38:27.208
You know what that means?

38:27.292 --> 38:30.542
You'll be rolling with the masses
on public transport.

38:30.625 --> 38:33.583
That thing you're always talking about.
That thing right there.

38:34.375 --> 38:35.333
Fuck.

39:44.833 --> 39:47.958
"Back in the good days,
the bank had given him a loyalty card,

39:48.042 --> 39:50.333
which he used to take her out on dates.

39:50.708 --> 39:52.083
Now she was being repossessed.

39:53.000 --> 39:56.292
The bank giveth and the bank taketh away."

39:57.208 --> 40:00.583
That's as far as I've got.
It's a work-in-progress.

40:02.375 --> 40:03.417
Mr. Matshane?

40:05.417 --> 40:08.458
- Max!
- Yes, I'm here.

40:11.208 --> 40:12.917
What I find strange is that

40:13.000 --> 40:16.333
the whole thing
is told from his perspective.

40:16.958 --> 40:22.125
She's the one that's getting purchased.
I'm assuming that she loves this guy.

40:22.208 --> 40:26.250
Seeing him go through this strife.
Why are we not hearing it from her side?

40:26.333 --> 40:30.875
Because women never have a say.
My sister is going through it right now.

40:30.958 --> 40:33.125
My uncles are demanding 100,000 rand

40:33.208 --> 40:36.125
from a guy who started working
two months ago. Gonna be in debt forever.

40:36.792 --> 40:39.458
And she will be forever at home
raising the kids.

40:39.542 --> 40:43.208
Or they could just decide
to not get married in this outdated way.

40:43.292 --> 40:45.875
They love each other.
It's free to get married.

40:45.958 --> 40:49.083
Unless of course your uncles
are murderous types

40:49.167 --> 40:51.625
that are going to punish them
for breaking the rules

40:51.708 --> 40:54.792
by chopping them up
and burying them in the garden.

40:54.875 --> 40:56.917
- You'd be surprised.
- Oh, really?

40:57.750 --> 40:59.208
The Mogale uncles are...

41:00.292 --> 41:03.125
- Okay.
- This is how things are done in Africa.

41:03.208 --> 41:06.958
There you have it.
Mr. Edwards, ladies and gentlemen.

41:07.042 --> 41:10.875
The expert on Africa.
That's our man there.

41:10.958 --> 41:13.958
You would know
about the Aka tribe from the DRC.

41:14.458 --> 41:17.250
Anybody know the Aka tribe from DRC?

41:17.333 --> 41:22.750
They are the only tribe on the planet
where gender roles are interchangeable.

41:22.833 --> 41:25.042
Women go out hunting

41:25.125 --> 41:28.000
while the men do the cooking,
look after the kids.

41:28.083 --> 41:31.125
They even let the kids suck on
their nipples as pacifiers.

41:32.125 --> 41:35.625
That's also how things are done in Africa.
But you knew this, of course.

41:36.208 --> 41:38.958
Thank you very much.
Let's reconvene another time.

41:42.542 --> 41:43.625
Have a good day.

41:44.542 --> 41:45.375
Hey.

41:46.333 --> 41:48.458
Hey. What's up?

41:50.208 --> 41:53.667
- Are you up for a joyride?
- I don't know what a joyride is.

41:53.750 --> 41:55.708
I'm so tired after last night.

41:55.792 --> 41:59.333
Come on. Try it. We'll have
another crushingly good night.

41:59.417 --> 42:00.833
No, I couldn't.

42:00.917 --> 42:04.083
- Max, it'll be the highlight of your week.
- No.

42:04.917 --> 42:07.500
No, I have so many commitments today.

42:07.583 --> 42:09.000
- Really?
- Yeah. It's just...

42:09.500 --> 42:12.458
Come on, you can't leave me alone.
I'm an old man.

42:12.958 --> 42:16.833
Help an old man, would you?
Come for a joyride with me.

42:19.208 --> 42:20.417
I'll give you a blowjob.

42:20.917 --> 42:24.500
I'm afraid the answer's gonna
have to be no. Thank you, though.

42:34.333 --> 42:36.833
Beautiful girl. Hello.

42:36.917 --> 42:38.125
- Hi.
- How are you?

42:38.208 --> 42:40.417
- I'm so sorry I'm late.
- It's all right...

42:40.500 --> 42:43.292
Jackie, I don't know,
she was a bit temperamental.

42:43.375 --> 42:45.500
- Did she spook or something?
- I think so.

42:46.250 --> 42:47.250
That's my car.

42:48.083 --> 42:51.500
Sorry about that again.
Were they taking care of you inside?

42:51.583 --> 42:55.250
we need more wealthy black people.

42:55.875 --> 42:59.292
I've invested millions
in black-owned businesses, you know?

42:59.542 --> 43:02.250
And from time to time, I do cool things,

43:02.333 --> 43:04.708
like teach poor black people
how to ride horses.

43:04.792 --> 43:07.208
So, does that justify
what your accusers call

43:07.292 --> 43:09.292
the rampant looting
of government contracts,

43:09.375 --> 43:11.208
your relationship with the President?

43:11.292 --> 43:15.542
Forbes reports your current wealth
at over 600 million dollars,

43:15.625 --> 43:18.958
while most black South Africans are living
below the breadline.

43:19.042 --> 43:20.292
How do you reconcile that?

43:21.292 --> 43:22.167
Well...

43:22.792 --> 43:26.625
I must say,
you are a very hot-looking lady.

43:26.708 --> 43:28.208
Very hot indeed.

43:28.792 --> 43:31.333
Actually, sizzling hot to be exact.

43:32.333 --> 43:35.542
- Is it?
- You know, how about you stay longer?

43:35.625 --> 43:39.000
We can discuss these questions,
let's say... over dinner?

43:39.667 --> 43:40.875
My wives are very chilled.

43:40.958 --> 43:44.083
- They will actually love you.
- You're a charming man,

43:44.167 --> 43:45.917
and thank you for the compliment,

43:46.000 --> 43:48.875
but if we could just stick on this.
Let's not digress.

43:49.375 --> 43:52.000
As I said before, we can try.

43:52.083 --> 43:54.375
Unless you can put a bag over your head

43:54.458 --> 43:57.458
to cover that beauty
because it sure is distracting.

43:58.958 --> 44:00.667
Want to check if we're recording.

44:01.917 --> 44:05.625
- Would you rather do this over the phone?
- I'm being flippant here.

44:06.292 --> 44:10.292
I apologize.
Please accept my apology. Please.

44:11.208 --> 44:13.458
- So, can we continue?
- Yes, let's continue.

44:41.833 --> 44:43.458
Why did you bring me here?

44:44.375 --> 44:47.833
Check out my old stomping ground.
Where did you grow up?

44:49.417 --> 44:50.417
Rustenburg.

44:51.458 --> 44:52.958
Small town boy.

44:53.500 --> 44:55.125
I read your novel again.

44:55.792 --> 44:58.125
You're actually pretty talented.

45:00.250 --> 45:02.167
- Thanks.
- If you're working on something,

45:02.250 --> 45:04.458
I could pass it on to
my publishers in London.

45:05.125 --> 45:08.958
- If you want.
- Yes, I'd appreciate that.

45:13.417 --> 45:16.542
Yeah, see?
That's the nonsense right there.

45:16.625 --> 45:19.542
- Where?
- Now Soweto is like a zoo

45:19.625 --> 45:23.667
for wealthy white foreigners
to come and see the natives.

45:23.750 --> 45:27.708
- Come on, man.
- Max, you must relax.

45:56.875 --> 45:59.417
- That's my baby.
- There she is.

46:08.000 --> 46:12.292
It feels like three seconds.
My God, you're so beautiful.

46:13.667 --> 46:17.542
This is a very promising young writer,
Max Matshane.

46:17.708 --> 46:20.833
And this is the love of ages, Ma Thuli.

46:21.417 --> 46:23.875
- Honored to meet you.
- Pleased to meet you.

46:23.958 --> 46:28.125
Enough about him. Now what about me?
Show me. Talk to me.

46:31.000 --> 46:32.375
What have we got?

46:33.833 --> 46:36.458
You look very hungry, I think I'll...

46:56.792 --> 46:58.542
Oh, thank you. Yes, please.

48:01.750 --> 48:06.875
Oh, come on, for fuck sakes!
You want to play or fuck around?

48:07.917 --> 48:10.208
- No, they're fucking around.
- It's okay.

48:10.292 --> 48:12.375
Don't fucking tell me
it's a fucking game.

48:12.458 --> 48:14.458
He's wasting my fucking time.

48:15.458 --> 48:18.333
Look like shit, bro.
Maybe we should forfeit.

48:19.042 --> 48:19.875
No.

48:21.000 --> 48:22.667
We play. We play.

48:30.875 --> 48:31.875
Sorry, guys.

48:33.000 --> 48:34.458
Like, really?

48:35.292 --> 48:37.792
<i>It was a work-related...</i>

48:39.000 --> 48:40.083
<i>outing.</i>

48:40.167 --> 48:41.167
He was, you know,

48:41.250 --> 48:46.458
telling me about London publishers
he's linking me up with. It's...

48:47.000 --> 48:51.250
You don't have an idea for a book yet.
Explain why you're looking at publishers.

48:55.500 --> 49:00.000
Do you realize that you've been drunk
every single day this week?

49:03.000 --> 49:04.208
Should I be worried?

49:06.000 --> 49:07.583
Hey, look at me.

49:08.417 --> 49:11.792
- Should I be worried?
- I'm fine.

49:13.083 --> 49:13.917
I'm fine.

49:14.583 --> 49:15.500
Okay.

49:18.125 --> 49:20.292
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

49:33.292 --> 49:34.500
You're clearly better.

49:35.958 --> 49:36.792
Yes.

49:39.417 --> 49:41.500
Can you come
to the poetry evening tonight?

49:43.125 --> 49:47.042
It would be great if we spent
some time together. Not get drunk.

49:49.083 --> 49:54.000
- I don't like her poetry, I'm sorry.
- We've got to support her, that's it.

49:54.083 --> 49:56.625
Gonna have another drunken night
with your best friend?

49:56.708 --> 49:59.250
- Is that what you're going to do?
- I just want to chill.

50:00.208 --> 50:03.708
You said it, I've been drunk every night
for the past week.

50:04.292 --> 50:05.833
I really want to just chill.

50:07.458 --> 50:10.625
Would just be nice if you made some effort
now and again, but...

50:46.375 --> 50:47.208
Hey.

50:47.875 --> 50:51.042
<i>If you really want me
to go to this thing tonight,</i>

50:51.583 --> 50:53.167
I'll be there, okay.

50:54.292 --> 50:55.292
<i>I love you.</i>

50:58.000 --> 51:02.417
What? No. Who holds a book launch
this early in the day?

51:02.500 --> 51:03.958
Is it a children's book?

51:04.583 --> 51:07.458
<i>I need support here.
I'm thoroughly outnumbered.</i>

51:08.125 --> 51:09.250
Excuse me. Good evening.

51:10.125 --> 51:12.958
No, I really can't.

51:13.042 --> 51:15.292
<i>Come on, Max. Have a couple of drinks.</i>

51:15.875 --> 51:19.208
<i>Arm yourself with some small talk
for the book launch.</i>

51:19.292 --> 51:22.167
<i>"Sorry I'm late, I've just come from
Heiner Miller's place.</i>"

51:23.167 --> 51:25.042
- No, I can't.
- <i>What?</i>

51:25.458 --> 51:26.417
Get here.

51:43.667 --> 51:47.125
Oh, no, brother. Not between these thighs.

51:49.208 --> 51:51.208
Because my mind has no fright.

51:52.542 --> 51:56.000
I don't fear your fists
because I have seen the pits.

51:58.250 --> 51:59.792
I'm not yours to break.

51:59.875 --> 52:02.875
My soul will never be your bread.

52:10.208 --> 52:12.208
Died and burnt to ashes.

52:12.583 --> 52:15.917
Reborn and saved by new passions.

52:39.500 --> 52:45.167
Max. Welcome to my humble abode.
Do not speak, put that inside you.

52:45.250 --> 52:46.292
Very humble.

52:48.083 --> 52:52.083
These are my very close friends
whom I've met this evening.

52:52.708 --> 52:57.625
I'm not sure if I should be here.
Some of these kids are in my class.

52:57.708 --> 52:59.792
Max, don't be conservative.

52:59.875 --> 53:03.667
Give them access to your mind.
Water their seeds of knowledge.

53:03.750 --> 53:05.833
Mingle. Go, get busy.

53:06.417 --> 53:07.833
In fact, this.

53:58.042 --> 54:01.708
- How dare you stand there without a drink.
- Thank you.

54:01.792 --> 54:02.875
Cheers.

54:05.208 --> 54:06.917
You never read my manuscript.

54:07.500 --> 54:11.417
Actually, I did.
And I was pleasantly surprised.

54:11.500 --> 54:14.333
- Really?
- There's quite a lot going on in there.

54:15.833 --> 54:18.958
- So you don't think I'm a chump?
- A little bit.

54:21.625 --> 54:23.792
- Come on, you really liked it?
- I did.

54:23.875 --> 54:26.792
I'm still reading it, but I'm enjoying it.

54:27.375 --> 54:29.458
Not just saying that
so I'll sleep with you?

54:29.542 --> 54:30.833
Excuse me?

54:31.375 --> 54:33.083
Relax, Max. Come.

54:38.208 --> 54:39.417
Hello.

54:43.042 --> 54:45.125
Easy there, Shay. Leave some for me.

54:53.000 --> 54:55.667
- There you go.
- No, I don't...

54:56.833 --> 54:59.542
- You don't take Charlie?
- No Charlie.

54:59.625 --> 55:04.292
- So you've never done any drugs?
- Well, weed. And...

55:05.750 --> 55:06.750
Weed, yeah.

55:07.667 --> 55:09.833
That is so cute.

55:10.333 --> 55:13.458
Here, think of it as an education
from your students.

55:13.542 --> 55:14.833
No.

55:14.917 --> 55:16.875
- Hey, man, come on.
- Just try it.

55:18.542 --> 55:20.792
Nobody's watching. Trust me.

55:20.875 --> 55:22.458
- They all left.
- Try it.

55:33.458 --> 55:36.958
You cannot compare Hitler to Shaka Zulu.
No, no, no.

55:37.375 --> 55:40.958
Hitler was a weak little man,
a damaged individual,

55:41.042 --> 55:45.167
whereas Shaka Zulu was a conqueror
akin to someone like Genghis Khan.

55:45.625 --> 55:50.208
He had a whole nation named after him.
It is supposed to do this to my gums?

55:50.292 --> 55:52.625
Just think about it for a second.

55:52.708 --> 55:55.958
The reason that Shaka went around
impaling people

55:56.042 --> 55:58.375
- is because he was gay.
- No, no, no.

55:58.458 --> 56:02.417
Young lady, you cannot keep saying
that my king is gay.

56:02.500 --> 56:06.042
That is grounds for heavy punishment.

56:06.125 --> 56:09.417
- You cannot say shit like that.
- What will you do? Impale her?

56:10.667 --> 56:12.667
- That's funny.
- Please do.

56:12.750 --> 56:15.917
What, no. You're funny as well.

56:18.458 --> 56:21.500
You guys, watch out for the traffic cops.

56:21.583 --> 56:23.542
- Bye, girls.
- Traffic cop season.

56:24.208 --> 56:25.458
They'll be fine.

56:26.250 --> 56:30.250
- And I also... I must also get...
- No, you can't leave.

56:31.083 --> 56:33.417
Party isn't over.
I'm digging your company.

56:33.500 --> 56:35.417
I too have dug your company.

56:35.500 --> 56:40.667
Thank you for the drugs,
and the great company, but I have to go.

56:40.750 --> 56:42.375
Max, you are not serious.

56:46.500 --> 56:47.583
Shit.

57:02.542 --> 57:04.167
- Your keys.
- Yeah.

57:04.792 --> 57:06.167
Gonna need those.

57:24.375 --> 57:27.000
I am a phoenix. Phoenix!

57:27.958 --> 57:29.125
Phoenix.

57:45.708 --> 57:49.417
I try to... With microfinance,
you've gotta find the human element.

57:49.500 --> 57:52.500
That's what's missing.
I try to bring that to it.

57:54.708 --> 57:57.083
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

57:58.000 --> 57:59.750
So, what did you think?

57:59.833 --> 58:02.125
- Did you like it?
- She really hates men.

58:02.958 --> 58:06.750
Come on. Hate is a bit of a strong word.

58:06.833 --> 58:10.792
- I thought it was interesting.
- Are you coming to drinks afterwards?

58:13.750 --> 58:15.792
No, I've got an early one.

58:16.583 --> 58:17.708
Yeah, me too.

58:18.542 --> 58:21.500
- Oh, okay.
- Where's your other half?

58:23.417 --> 58:27.208
- Let's do tea or something next week.
- Tea?

58:28.333 --> 58:30.958
- Okay.
- Nice to see you.

58:31.042 --> 58:33.167
Nice to see you too. Joel?

58:34.583 --> 58:36.292
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:41.958 --> 58:43.958
Don't worry.

58:46.125 --> 58:47.958
Is everything okay?

58:51.375 --> 58:54.708
- Do I not do it for you?
- No, you totally...

58:55.042 --> 58:57.625
You totally do it for me.
Okay, I'll be back.

58:57.708 --> 58:59.083
Just give me a second.

58:59.167 --> 59:02.000
- I can help you.
- No, it's good. I'm fine.

59:02.083 --> 59:05.000
- Maybe you just need some more time.
- I'm good.

59:11.208 --> 59:14.958
- I'm sure I can help you.
- It's fine.

59:23.458 --> 59:24.375
Ah, man.

59:29.042 --> 59:30.542
What the fuck?

59:31.000 --> 59:32.750
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

59:32.833 --> 59:35.750
- What now? What's going on?
- Is he gonna be okay?

59:36.792 --> 59:41.667
- I think he had a heart attack.
- Heiner! Do you know what he took?

59:42.750 --> 59:46.167
- We don't know.
- Call an ambulance!

59:46.250 --> 59:48.875
Fuck, fuck, fuck.

59:48.958 --> 59:52.208
- Do something. Shit.
- Oh, my God!

01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.542
If he's gonna go home tomorrow,
he'll need full-time care.

01:00:06.625 --> 01:00:11.667
- Does he have family in Johannesburg?
- I... I don't think so, no.

01:00:12.458 --> 01:00:17.750
- Gonna have to contact the university.
- No, I'll do that.

01:00:34.292 --> 01:00:35.875
I'm going on a detox.

01:00:39.917 --> 01:00:42.792
- How was the book launch?
- It was fine.

01:00:44.917 --> 01:00:45.792
And...

01:00:46.292 --> 01:00:50.417
- You're fine with him staying with us...
- I've already said it's fine.

01:00:51.542 --> 01:00:52.375
Okay.

01:00:54.375 --> 01:00:56.375
Waiter, can we get the bill please?

01:00:58.833 --> 01:00:59.875
Oh.

01:01:00.333 --> 01:01:02.792
So we're done. Good to know.

01:01:02.875 --> 01:01:05.250
I just assumed that...
We can stay if you want.

01:01:05.333 --> 01:01:07.542
No.
You've already decided we're leaving.

01:01:07.625 --> 01:01:10.333
I'm just a mere mortal.
The decision can be undone.

01:01:10.417 --> 01:01:15.083
Waiter, on second thought,
can we please have two more coffees?

01:01:16.792 --> 01:01:19.208
Now you just assume I want coffee.

01:01:19.917 --> 01:01:24.583
- What? Okay, waiter...
- No, it's fine, we'll have coffee.

01:01:24.667 --> 01:01:27.417
It's in your culture
to decide for women what they want.

01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:30.125
- Jesus Christ.
- I can't even pick my own drink.

01:01:30.208 --> 01:01:33.333
- I will have the damn coffee.
- I'm sorry.

01:01:34.042 --> 01:01:37.875
- What are you sorry for?
- For being a patriarchal bastard.

01:01:37.958 --> 01:01:40.125
- Maybe.
- Look who's here.

01:01:40.208 --> 01:01:42.500
- Look who's here.
- Well, thank you.

01:01:42.583 --> 01:01:44.583
- Oh, hey.
- Oh, hi.

01:01:45.750 --> 01:01:49.000
I seem to be bumping into everyone
this morning. It's like...

01:01:49.750 --> 01:01:51.667
- the new hotspot.
- That's crazy.

01:01:51.750 --> 01:01:57.375
I was just coming to buy some plants
for my house. And then...

01:01:58.333 --> 01:01:59.708
And I was taking a walk.

01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.167
- Where were you last night?
- Long story.

01:02:09.208 --> 01:02:10.167
So.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:13.958
- It was lovely bumping into you.
- Yeah.

01:02:14.042 --> 01:02:16.500
I'm going to get on
with my plant shopping.

01:02:16.958 --> 01:02:18.875
And I will call you later.

01:02:20.792 --> 01:02:22.333
- Nice.
- Bye.

01:02:24.083 --> 01:02:24.917
Bye.

01:02:27.125 --> 01:02:28.583
You guys look great and...

01:02:29.042 --> 01:02:31.417
You know, you gotta let the feet move.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:34.667
Bye, Joel.

01:02:37.333 --> 01:02:38.708
What's going on?

01:02:40.250 --> 01:02:43.917
- I think those two are dating.
- Isn't she married?

01:02:44.708 --> 01:02:46.708
- Yes.
- No.

01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:50.833
Call me.

01:02:55.375 --> 01:02:58.292
I hope you guys like chili
because I love chili.

01:02:58.375 --> 01:03:01.208
- We love chili.
- We love spicy food.

01:03:03.042 --> 01:03:07.917
I want to say, I'm really grateful
for letting me intrude in your house.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.875
- You're not intruding.
- You're not intruding at all.

01:03:10.958 --> 01:03:12.542
What's the world coming to?

01:03:12.625 --> 01:03:17.875
You have one isolated case
of Viagra-induced cardiac arrest

01:03:17.958 --> 01:03:20.000
and they want to put you
in an old-age home.

01:03:21.750 --> 01:03:24.292
I noticed you guys don't have kids.
Is that the plan?

01:03:24.375 --> 01:03:25.917
Not that you have to.

01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.458
But it's kind of the norm
for people your age.

01:03:28.792 --> 01:03:31.458
We're planning to have kids.
At least one, right?

01:03:33.542 --> 01:03:35.000
Excuse me.

01:03:35.083 --> 01:03:40.250
- Did you ever get married or have kids?
- No kids. My career took over.

01:03:40.792 --> 01:03:44.625
- Before I knew it, I was over the hill.
- You're not over the hill.

01:03:44.708 --> 01:03:47.250
You're on the hill
looking down on all of us.

01:03:47.333 --> 01:03:50.083
I feel like I'm gonna be
under the hill soon.

01:03:51.875 --> 01:03:54.833
- But you were in love at least, right?
- Yeah.

01:03:55.542 --> 01:03:58.708
I was in a long relationship once
with a guy I met at Varsity.

01:03:58.875 --> 01:03:59.792
No.

01:03:59.917 --> 01:04:03.250
Then I met my first wife.
Shame. Broke his heart.

01:04:04.458 --> 01:04:07.333
- Then she broke mine.
- Talk about bucking the trend.

01:04:07.417 --> 01:04:12.042
It's all in my book, <i>Ongeluk</i>.
Except I changed him into a black woman.

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:15.083
I figured,
South African audience at that time

01:04:15.167 --> 01:04:17.625
wouldn't be able to digest
a gay love story.

01:04:17.708 --> 01:04:19.792
But an interracial love story
was even worse.

01:04:19.875 --> 01:04:23.750
I didn't know that about the book
and I've read it twice.

01:04:23.833 --> 01:04:24.833
That's interesting.

01:04:25.583 --> 01:04:27.750
- Twice?
- I didn't know that.

01:04:28.583 --> 01:04:29.500
You all right?

01:04:30.042 --> 01:04:32.875
Fine. Just have this pain
that's been there for a week.

01:04:32.958 --> 01:04:35.667
- Show me.
- Under the blade.

01:04:35.750 --> 01:04:37.958
- Great, stand up straight.
- Okay.

01:04:38.042 --> 01:04:42.792
This Cambodian monk told me
this pressure point. There?

01:04:43.167 --> 01:04:45.417
Yeah. A bit harder.

01:04:47.375 --> 01:04:49.750
I think the soup is ready.

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:53.042
That's much better, actually.

01:04:56.208 --> 01:04:59.292
<i>You just have to uncork
another bottle of wine</i>

01:04:59.375 --> 01:05:02.792
and I will regale you
with tales of my misadventures.

01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:07.917
I think we've had enough wine
for many nights.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:11.208
It might be too dangerous
with your medication.

01:05:11.292 --> 01:05:16.333
You're right, it would be very dangerous.
Lucky I haven't taken any of the pills.

01:05:20.833 --> 01:05:22.167
I guess we'll have more wine.

01:05:23.250 --> 01:05:25.042
- Drink!
- Are you crazy?

01:06:06.833 --> 01:06:07.667
You know...

01:06:08.583 --> 01:06:11.083
I haven't almost died for quite a while.

01:06:12.958 --> 01:06:15.042
And the last time, it was intentional.

01:06:15.125 --> 01:06:18.333
- Everybody was doing it.
- What do you mean?

01:06:18.417 --> 01:06:19.375
This time...

01:06:20.083 --> 01:06:22.958
it's different.
It's because I'm getting old.

01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:29.500
- No, it's because you party too hard.
- Too hard for what?

01:06:29.583 --> 01:06:31.750
For my age. You can say it.

01:06:31.833 --> 01:06:36.542
So, you and Max were talking about Viagra.

01:06:40.167 --> 01:06:42.375
The snoring lion awakes.

01:06:43.292 --> 01:06:44.792
Look at his face.

01:06:45.708 --> 01:06:46.833
Hello, baby.

01:06:48.667 --> 01:06:51.042
- What time is it?
- What did you say?

01:06:57.083 --> 01:06:58.375
Come on.

01:07:00.375 --> 01:07:01.583
Sam, come on.

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:06.375
No.

01:07:07.792 --> 01:07:11.417
Baby, he said I have crazy hair.

01:07:16.167 --> 01:07:17.042
Hey!

01:07:20.458 --> 01:07:23.750
You know if those students squeal,
you could lose your job.

01:07:24.250 --> 01:07:26.833
Lennox Papo.

01:07:26.917 --> 01:07:30.958
You live some other kind of life.
He's staying with you now?

01:07:32.167 --> 01:07:34.750
- Aren't you going to Cape Town soon?
- Yep.

01:07:35.083 --> 01:07:38.542
- Your wife's cool with this?
- It would seem so.

01:07:38.708 --> 01:07:41.833
At least you can say
you had a literary giant stay.

01:07:41.917 --> 01:07:44.708
Use it in conversation.
Tell me about the girl.

01:07:45.833 --> 01:07:49.750
I don't know, man.
I think I should tell Sam about it.

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:52.958
I'm so wrecked with guilt.
I'm not used to this.

01:07:53.042 --> 01:07:54.833
- I don't know.
- No.

01:07:54.917 --> 01:07:58.208
Bad idea. Leave your wife out of it.
Nothing happened.

01:08:00.083 --> 01:08:01.125
Nothing happened.

01:08:03.667 --> 01:08:06.667
- It will probably hurt her as well, right?
- Exactly.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:08.000
You don't want that.

01:08:08.708 --> 01:08:10.708
Okay, you're right.

01:08:11.167 --> 01:08:15.208
The one and only time I took cocaine,
it had the opposite effect.

01:08:15.292 --> 01:08:16.582
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:17.457 --> 01:08:20.292
I was going all night.
Thought my heart would explode.

01:08:20.667 --> 01:08:23.000
Are you familiar with "crushing pussy"?

01:08:23.375 --> 01:08:25.042
I get the picture, yes.

01:08:25.125 --> 01:08:28.332
Sorry to be so raw,
but that's an apt description.

01:08:28.792 --> 01:08:33.042
It's the collision between two people.

01:08:33.125 --> 01:08:35.750
- It's like...
- I get it. I get it, thanks.

01:08:35.832 --> 01:08:40.582
Max, Sam,
let's just understand the difference

01:08:40.667 --> 01:08:42.125
between these two policies.

01:08:42.582 --> 01:08:43.875
Disability cover.

01:08:44.542 --> 01:08:47.792
You're covered
if you're physically incapacitated.

01:08:47.875 --> 01:08:49.000
You'll be looked after.

01:08:49.917 --> 01:08:51.667
Life cover on the other side.

01:08:52.292 --> 01:08:54.375
God forbid, one of you should die,

01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:57.250
your loved ones will be looked after.

01:08:57.832 --> 01:08:59.000
All right.

01:08:59.207 --> 01:09:02.375
All we need are the names
of the beneficiaries for now.

01:09:02.457 --> 01:09:03.917
This is hectic.

01:09:04.792 --> 01:09:07.082
Obviously, I'll put Sam.

01:09:07.167 --> 01:09:10.667
- If anything happens to me.
- Naturally. That's good.

01:09:11.707 --> 01:09:12.542
Sam?

01:09:13.542 --> 01:09:14.667
Um...

01:09:19.457 --> 01:09:21.417
I'd like to put my brother Joey down.

01:09:22.457 --> 01:09:23.707
- Joey?
- Joey, yeah.

01:09:24.750 --> 01:09:26.042
Wait, wait.

01:09:26.125 --> 01:09:31.582
If anything happens to me, you benefit,
but if something happens to you,

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.957
God forbid,

01:09:33.667 --> 01:09:36.000
your brother takes everything.
How is that fair?

01:09:36.667 --> 01:09:39.375
It's not unusual. It's not about fairness.

01:09:39.457 --> 01:09:43.542
It's about your needs.
Your beneficiary's needs.

01:09:43.625 --> 01:09:46.000
Really?
We could discuss this somewhere else.

01:09:46.082 --> 01:09:48.250
- Not here.
- It's happening now, right?

01:09:48.332 --> 01:09:50.000
- This is what's happening.
- Fine.

01:09:50.082 --> 01:09:52.707
But you know
my brother's wheelchair-bound.

01:09:52.792 --> 01:09:55.208
Wheelchair-bound.
And if something happens to me,

01:09:55.292 --> 01:09:57.792
I don't know
who's going to take care of him.

01:09:57.875 --> 01:09:59.917
Open another life policy for each other.

01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.833
Your brother's been milking
this wheelchair-bound crap for decades.

01:10:04.917 --> 01:10:09.583
With all due respect, he's able-bodied
when it comes to drinking whisky.

01:10:09.667 --> 01:10:11.458
- Right? Yeah.
- Really?

01:10:11.542 --> 01:10:15.500
- Really?
- He's always playing the victim.

01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.583
If he was in your shoes...

01:10:18.667 --> 01:10:21.167
Sorry, he can't be in shoes.
He doesn't have legs.

01:10:21.250 --> 01:10:23.625
- I take that back. Sorry.
- You know what?

01:10:23.708 --> 01:10:28.292
Sir, I'm so sorry, but I never thought
this middle-class bullshit was for me.

01:10:28.375 --> 01:10:31.083
Handle it with him. Handle his life.

01:10:31.708 --> 01:10:34.375
There's no policy on
how to deal with your wife.

01:10:34.458 --> 01:10:37.792
- Yo, man, let's calm down. Hey!
- Whatever.

01:10:38.917 --> 01:10:39.792
Sam.

01:10:41.292 --> 01:10:44.042
- I can wait. Shall I wait?
- Can we do this later?

01:10:44.583 --> 01:10:48.208
Let's get the account details
and the signatures, so on the phone,

01:10:48.292 --> 01:10:50.042
- you can just give me the name.
- Dude.

01:10:53.333 --> 01:10:54.208
Sam.

01:10:55.583 --> 01:10:57.833
- Sam.
- Just leave me alone.

01:10:57.917 --> 01:10:59.958
- Let's talk.
- Fuck off, Max!

01:11:28.583 --> 01:11:30.542
- I'm sorry.
- You're a dick.

01:11:31.833 --> 01:11:32.667
Yes.

01:11:33.708 --> 01:11:34.542
I'm a dick.

01:11:35.042 --> 01:11:35.875
So.

01:11:36.958 --> 01:11:38.375
What about a nightcap?

01:11:39.208 --> 01:11:43.542
No, I'm exhausted and my back
is killing me. I need to lie down.

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:47.875
Me too.
And I've got a flight in the morning.

01:11:48.375 --> 01:11:49.625
Oh, shit, that's tomorrow?

01:11:51.708 --> 01:11:54.750
- Should I take you to the airport?
- It's fine. I'll ask Joel.

01:11:54.833 --> 01:11:57.000
- It's fine.
- No, it's fine, I'll take you.

01:11:57.542 --> 01:12:00.208
- Sure?
- I just said I'll take you.

01:12:01.667 --> 01:12:02.792
Maybe...

01:12:03.667 --> 01:12:06.167
Maybe it's a good time
for me to head back.

01:12:06.250 --> 01:12:10.167
Maybe it's not proper for me to be around
while you're away.

01:12:10.250 --> 01:12:13.542
You're probably right.
I don't want to burden her with...

01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.833
Are you cool with him staying?

01:12:16.917 --> 01:12:20.167
Because you've got to go to work
and I'm not gonna be around.

01:12:21.375 --> 01:12:22.542
Gee...

01:12:23.458 --> 01:12:27.250
I don't mind.
But... what did the doctor say?

01:12:32.708 --> 01:12:36.583
You've got a point.
Don't want to leave a man in his state...

01:12:37.042 --> 01:12:39.125
- Yeah.
- ...unattended.

01:12:39.333 --> 01:12:44.375
Excellent, it's settled then. So...
who's gonna join me in a drink? Come!

01:12:45.083 --> 01:12:48.042
You can't leave an old man to drink alone.

01:12:48.125 --> 01:12:51.292
There's nothing to think of but sorrows
when you drink alone.

01:12:51.375 --> 01:12:55.875
How about not drinking at all?
Have you tried that maybe?

01:12:56.375 --> 01:12:59.667
Don't be ridiculous.
Come on, just one glass.

01:13:00.458 --> 01:13:03.000
Just one little, itty bitty...

01:13:04.458 --> 01:13:06.750
Okay, just one glass.

01:13:08.167 --> 01:13:12.167
- What about you, Mr. Matshane?
- No, I'd fall asleep. I'm going to bed.

01:13:12.833 --> 01:13:15.625
Babe, I'll see you after your one glass.

01:13:19.750 --> 01:13:21.750
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

01:13:25.125 --> 01:13:29.750
- How do you feel about life insurance?
- I hate the smell of those companies.

01:13:50.417 --> 01:13:51.250
Fuck!

01:14:11.292 --> 01:14:12.167
Hey!

01:14:12.958 --> 01:14:16.292
- It's three o'clock in the morning.
- Yes.

01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:21.083
Soon it'll be four o'clock and then five
and then six o'clock.

01:14:21.750 --> 01:14:23.750
You know what they say, YOLO.

01:14:24.167 --> 01:14:26.083
Baby, you should come here.

01:14:26.167 --> 01:14:29.708
- Give him a massage!
- Got a flight in the morning, remember?

01:14:30.458 --> 01:14:33.500
The airport, yeah.

01:14:34.750 --> 01:14:35.792
Just wait.

01:14:40.500 --> 01:14:43.833
Thank you. Baby, I'm coming
to take you to the airport.

01:14:48.417 --> 01:14:49.292
Baby?

01:14:57.792 --> 01:15:00.000
He's a cutie pie.

01:15:00.083 --> 01:15:03.417
- Stop it, dude.
- I'm not a dude.

01:15:03.500 --> 01:15:06.917
Listen. <i>I'm every woman</i>

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.208
<i>It's all in... </i> See, I'm not a dude.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:14.750
- Maximilian.
- Sam, stop it.

01:15:15.583 --> 01:15:17.375
- I just want Maximus.
- No.

01:15:18.833 --> 01:15:19.667
Okay.

01:15:20.750 --> 01:15:22.083
Switch off the light.

01:15:51.125 --> 01:15:53.667
Hey, so...

01:15:54.250 --> 01:15:57.000
I have a slight problem
I might need your advice on.

01:15:57.083 --> 01:16:01.625
Look, I don't wanna talk right now.
Got quite a bit on my mind, okay?

01:16:01.708 --> 01:16:03.708
What? When will you want to talk?

01:16:03.792 --> 01:16:07.083
I'm only fetching you because I need
someone to listen to my problem.

01:16:07.208 --> 01:16:11.125
I also need someone to listen
to my problem. It's not going to work.

01:16:11.208 --> 01:16:12.708
When did you get this problem?

01:16:14.042 --> 01:16:17.042
It must be a new problem,
which came after my problem.

01:16:22.792 --> 01:16:25.958
- Do you think Heiner would fuck my wife?
- Woah.

01:16:27.333 --> 01:16:28.583
That's a big problem.

01:16:33.333 --> 01:16:37.542
What the hell was I thinking?
Bringing a guy like that into my house.

01:16:38.083 --> 01:16:40.500
It's like bringing a wolf into a...

01:16:41.458 --> 01:16:42.417
into my house.

01:16:44.042 --> 01:16:47.042
Actually, I don't care
that he's got heart problems.

01:16:47.125 --> 01:16:48.375
He's moving out.

01:16:48.875 --> 01:16:50.208
He's out.

01:16:51.083 --> 01:16:52.458
So what's your problem?

01:16:54.167 --> 01:16:57.042
Well, I'm sort of seeing this woman.

01:16:58.625 --> 01:17:01.125
- Go on.
- Who is sort of married.

01:17:02.083 --> 01:17:04.625
- Sort of married or married?
- Married.

01:17:05.333 --> 01:17:06.167
And?

01:17:06.917 --> 01:17:09.542
She's hinting that she wants
to leave her husband for me.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:13.333
What? Tabitha wants to leave
her husband for you?

01:17:13.917 --> 01:17:15.625
- Who said it was Tabitha?
- Oh, shit.

01:17:15.708 --> 01:17:17.500
Talking to your wife?

01:17:17.583 --> 01:17:19.500
- Fuck.
- Everybody's seen you.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:23.042
The hat, the jacket,
you were very clearly out on a date.

01:17:37.125 --> 01:17:40.500
Do you mind turning that music off
for a bit?

01:17:52.500 --> 01:17:55.792
<i>Everybody is so excited
about your talk tomorrow.</i>

01:17:55.875 --> 01:17:59.750
I'm just so passionate about...

01:17:59.833 --> 01:18:05.458
I'm fascinated by creators and thinkers
who are shaping our continent.

01:18:06.250 --> 01:18:08.333
Have you heard of Monsieur Bon Bon?

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:12.833
He is one of the most amazing
cultural commentators.

01:18:12.917 --> 01:18:15.708
- I'll be sure to check him out.
- You should.

01:18:15.792 --> 01:18:18.417
Postmodern, post-colonial.

01:18:19.125 --> 01:18:21.125
Post-apartheid. Yes.

01:18:25.708 --> 01:18:26.708
Mr. Tim.

01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:29.917
Such a pleasure having you here.

01:18:30.417 --> 01:18:33.542
We really are looking forward
to the talk tomorrow.

01:18:34.000 --> 01:18:37.667
- Gonna be a hell of a crowd.
- I'm really looking forward to it.

01:18:37.750 --> 01:18:39.500
- Good.
- Thank you for having me.

01:18:39.583 --> 01:18:41.417
- Good to see you.
- Great.

01:18:44.375 --> 01:18:49.125
Everybody's looking forward to my talk.
It's the talk of the town, baby.

01:18:49.583 --> 01:18:50.417
Yep.

01:18:51.417 --> 01:18:54.958
Yeah, I'm still hungover.
I didn't even go to work.

01:18:55.042 --> 01:18:56.000
So...

01:18:57.750 --> 01:19:01.958
Yeah. I just... One can't say no
to this guy. It's crazy.

01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:05.875
I can talk to him. Let me talk to him.
He must go.

01:19:05.958 --> 01:19:09.583
No, no, no. It's fine. I can handle him.
I can figure it out.

01:19:09.667 --> 01:19:14.542
And anyway, tonight I've got...
I've got a lot of work to do today so...

01:19:14.917 --> 01:19:17.792
I'll make sure he takes his pills
and I'll have an early night.

01:19:18.167 --> 01:19:19.083
All right.

01:19:30.208 --> 01:19:34.708
My problem is that everyone wants me
to be a grown-up.

01:19:34.792 --> 01:19:38.583
It's like everyone is forcing me
to be a certain kind of grown-up.

01:19:38.667 --> 01:19:41.875
My mother wants me to grow up.
My colleagues want me to.

01:19:41.958 --> 01:19:44.250
Even my therapist is telling me to!

01:19:45.083 --> 01:19:47.917
- You're in therapy?
- Everyone is. Aren't you?

01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:50.167
No, babe. Not in therapy.

01:19:51.667 --> 01:19:53.958
But it's okay. Which one do you like?

01:19:54.708 --> 01:19:55.625
You choose.

01:19:57.458 --> 01:20:01.042
Another thing is this whole
Johannesburg situation. I think...

01:20:03.667 --> 01:20:04.875
I think I'm over it.

01:20:05.542 --> 01:20:07.208
I can't be in this world anymore.

01:20:07.292 --> 01:20:09.292
- Thank you.
- Thank you, bye.

01:20:10.250 --> 01:20:15.000
I want to just pack my bags
and go figure it out.

01:20:15.083 --> 01:20:16.667
Then go and figure it out.

01:20:16.750 --> 01:20:22.583
- When you look at Heiner's life.
- Yes, tell me more about the Heiner.

01:20:23.167 --> 01:20:24.000
Look.

01:20:26.500 --> 01:20:28.792
A congregation. Let's go check it out.

01:20:30.083 --> 01:20:33.333
I don't understand what the problem is.
I thought you felt the same.

01:20:33.417 --> 01:20:35.417
- I do.
- Then what's the problem?

01:20:37.083 --> 01:20:39.417
Hi!

01:20:41.250 --> 01:20:44.542
We have to stop bumping into each other
like this.

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:47.667
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah.

01:20:48.125 --> 01:20:50.667
Hay fever. Yeah.

01:20:51.875 --> 01:20:57.083
I have to go. Joel, it was lovely
to see you. Goodbye.

01:20:57.167 --> 01:20:59.875
Bye, guys. Good to see you.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:04.583
Joel?

01:21:05.458 --> 01:21:06.417
Huh?

01:21:06.667 --> 01:21:08.208
Is she okay?

01:21:09.250 --> 01:21:11.333
- Joel?
- Hay fever.

01:21:12.125 --> 01:21:17.333
- Let's not interrupt the congregation.
- We'll be down the road having drinks.

01:21:17.417 --> 01:21:22.333
- Feel free to join if you want to.
- Okay, later, later.

01:21:41.417 --> 01:21:42.375
Sorry.

01:21:44.833 --> 01:21:49.708
I got carried away and all emotional.
It won't happen again.

01:21:50.458 --> 01:21:52.750
And I will see you...

01:21:55.542 --> 01:21:57.542
tomorrow, and maybe...

01:21:58.125 --> 01:22:02.833
we should go away
for a weekend together.

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:09.458
Okay, bye.

01:22:09.542 --> 01:22:13.417
But the thing is... you're married.

01:22:19.417 --> 01:22:24.000
The day the city of Cape Town
put an embargo on black people...

01:22:24.083 --> 01:22:25.167
What's going on?

01:22:25.917 --> 01:22:28.708
This is Cape Town.
I don't understand your beef.

01:22:28.792 --> 01:22:31.125
Cape Town has always been like this.

01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:34.500
You're not in the trenches of Soweto
in that Joburg of yours.

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:37.917
Now you're acting all cool here.
This is how you live in Johannesburg.

01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.208
The only black guy in here is the waiter.

01:22:40.292 --> 01:22:42.833
- Come on.
- I get what you mean.

01:22:43.708 --> 01:22:45.917
I was thinking of moving to Joburg.
I like it.

01:22:46.000 --> 01:22:49.833
I'm planning the move in my mind.
I just have to convince..<i>.</i>

01:22:49.917 --> 01:22:52.917
- Tracy, yeah.
- Yeah, convince...

01:22:53.875 --> 01:22:56.500
- Do you guys need anything from the bar?
- Thank you.

01:22:56.958 --> 01:22:58.958
I should be fine.

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:01.042
She knows.

01:23:04.583 --> 01:23:09.417
What's going on? Are you and Tracy happy?
Is everything okay?

01:23:09.917 --> 01:23:11.542
Me and Tracy are happy.

01:23:12.042 --> 01:23:13.375
We couldn't be happier.

01:23:13.458 --> 01:23:17.083
You're cheating.
Are you what they call a "blesser"?

01:23:17.167 --> 01:23:18.667
I don't like your tone.

01:23:18.750 --> 01:23:21.250
You're supposed to be my friend
and now you're judgey.

01:23:21.333 --> 01:23:23.917
I'll tell you why I sound judgmental,

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:27.583
because just over two months ago
I was best man at your wedding.

01:23:27.667 --> 01:23:30.375
And now I find myself mid-cheek. So...

01:23:30.833 --> 01:23:32.750
- Yeah.
- If you remember that wedding,

01:23:32.833 --> 01:23:36.875
I promised my wife
that I would make her happy for eternity.

01:23:36.958 --> 01:23:39.417
- You call my wife right now.
- No.

01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.458
Ask her if she's happy.
She will tell you she's happy.

01:23:42.542 --> 01:23:44.292
That's all that really matters.

01:23:44.375 --> 01:23:47.250
- I'll take your word for it.
- We're happy.

01:23:47.833 --> 01:23:52.000
We cook together. We travel together.
We have sex every day.

01:23:52.083 --> 01:23:54.792
- The other day we had a threesome.
- Okay.

01:23:54.875 --> 01:23:56.542
A ménage à trois.

01:23:56.750 --> 01:24:01.625
Are you telling me
that Tracy is fine with you cheating?

01:24:01.708 --> 01:24:05.625
I'm saying Tracy is happy

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:08.917
with a husband who makes her happy.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:12.792
- Happy is the key word here.
- Are you not in love with her?

01:24:13.292 --> 01:24:15.667
The thing is with me,
I've got too much love.

01:24:15.750 --> 01:24:19.250
The cup runneth over with love.
There's love all over the floor.

01:24:19.333 --> 01:24:22.542
What do you want me to do?
Do you want to throw it away?

01:24:22.625 --> 01:24:24.417
No, I've gotta give it to others.

01:24:24.500 --> 01:24:26.333
I'm taking this love from the floor

01:24:26.417 --> 01:24:29.458
and giving it to other people
because I don't want to waste it.

01:24:29.542 --> 01:24:31.250
That's all you need to understand.

01:24:31.333 --> 01:24:34.417
Herbert Gwala, come on, four wives.

01:24:34.500 --> 01:24:37.500
Happiest guy on Earth.
Every time you see him, he's jolly,

01:24:37.583 --> 01:24:41.750
- he's laughing, good times.
- I need the loo.

01:24:41.833 --> 01:24:45.125
Go to the loo, think about it.
Right now, you're overreacting.

01:24:45.875 --> 01:24:47.958
Hey, waiter. Can I order from you?

01:24:48.833 --> 01:24:50.000
Fuck off.

01:24:53.042 --> 01:24:56.333
Mr. Heiner Miller,
how are you feeling today?

01:24:56.875 --> 01:25:00.625
I'm much better. In fact, I've come
for a quick coffee with the girls.

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:05.167
- The girls?
- Your wife and Laz.

01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:07.333
Listen, how are the lectures going?

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:10.875
I'm only starting tomorrow.

01:25:11.375 --> 01:25:15.167
Give them hell, kiddo! We'll chat soon.

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.458
Hey, baby, how are you?

01:25:24.583 --> 01:25:25.875
Nice. Who you with?

01:25:25.958 --> 01:25:28.833
I'm with Laz in Melville,
catching up after work.

01:25:28.917 --> 01:25:30.958
She wanted to talk through some things.

01:25:31.917 --> 01:25:32.833
Just the two of you?

01:25:34.375 --> 01:25:38.042
Just the two of us but we are in Melville,
so anything can happen.

01:25:38.875 --> 01:25:41.500
More drinking.
I thought you were having an early night?

01:25:43.542 --> 01:25:47.542
No, not judging.
Just don't drink and drive, okay?

01:25:47.917 --> 01:25:50.125
I love you too, babe. See you later.

01:25:50.583 --> 01:25:51.417
Okay, bye.

01:25:52.292 --> 01:25:53.125
Let's drink.

01:25:53.500 --> 01:25:54.417
Fuck.

01:25:55.875 --> 01:25:56.708
Hey, man.

01:25:57.750 --> 01:26:00.125
- I need a favor.
- No.

01:26:00.917 --> 01:26:04.792
No, no, no. That's not going to work.

01:26:07.292 --> 01:26:12.292
Let me get this straight.
You left a guy with your wife at home.

01:26:14.417 --> 01:26:16.583
Together, just chilling.

01:26:16.708 --> 01:26:20.042
That's like leaving a colonialist
with all your treasures.

01:26:21.958 --> 01:26:26.417
You Africans don't learn.
You Africans with your African ways.

01:26:28.375 --> 01:26:31.125
Listen, I don't want to be disrespectful
to your wife.

01:26:31.250 --> 01:26:34.542
She's lovely, but that dude
is going to colonize that ass.

01:26:35.250 --> 01:26:37.000
Are you not forgetting somebody?

01:26:38.708 --> 01:26:42.125
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
Hey, how are you?

01:26:42.833 --> 01:26:44.292
There's a colony being built.

01:27:01.292 --> 01:27:02.250
Hey.

01:27:02.917 --> 01:27:07.000
I was just walking back to my car,
decided to have one more drink.

01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:11.792
- Great, why don't you just have a seat.
- Thanks. Excuse me.

01:27:12.375 --> 01:27:14.042
Do you have a BlackBerry charger?

01:27:14.667 --> 01:27:17.292
Now, you see?
There is my point illustrated.

01:27:17.667 --> 01:27:20.250
The man has to have his phone charged.

01:27:20.708 --> 01:27:23.292
Are we not too dependent
on these machines? And you.

01:27:23.375 --> 01:27:26.167
You cannot go two minutes
without touching your phones.

01:27:26.250 --> 01:27:27.417
We're dependent.

01:27:28.875 --> 01:27:32.250
- Pinky promise I will not look at it.
- I'll hold you to that.

01:27:32.792 --> 01:27:36.875
- And who still uses a BlackBerry?
- That's not nice.

01:27:37.292 --> 01:27:39.458
- Are you wearing a different shirt?
- No.

01:27:39.542 --> 01:27:41.417
- You're wearing a different shirt.
- No.

01:27:41.500 --> 01:27:43.833
- He's wearing a different shirt.
- Enough.

01:27:43.917 --> 01:27:46.250
Can we put a drink in front of this man?

01:27:46.625 --> 01:27:49.333
And put your phone away,
we just spoke about it.

01:27:49.417 --> 01:27:52.750
- A drink.
- Help us, it's dry!

01:27:53.750 --> 01:27:56.042
<i>This is Joel Sabiti, leave a message.</i>

01:27:56.417 --> 01:27:58.083
Come on, why is your phone off?

01:28:06.792 --> 01:28:09.333
Look, the person is married.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.417
Are you ready to be that guy
and break a happy home?

01:28:12.500 --> 01:28:15.542
No. That's why I'm trying to
break this off. But she won't let up.

01:28:15.958 --> 01:28:19.458
Wait. How happy can the home be

01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:22.792
if she's finding carnal pleasures
in another man's bed?

01:28:22.875 --> 01:28:25.583
Heiner, are you advocating adultery?

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:29.458
I'm not advocating anything.
It's too late, the deed is done.

01:28:29.542 --> 01:28:32.500
But these are grown people.
Does she have children?

01:28:32.583 --> 01:28:35.667
- But that doesn't matter.
- Was the sex good?

01:28:36.042 --> 01:28:39.542
- Yeah, the sex is good.
- Do you have another life?

01:28:40.542 --> 01:28:42.542
A cat's got nine lives.
Do you have another?

01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:43.833
Of course not.

01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:48.417
I'm not saying go out to hurt people,
but you have free will. So does she.

01:28:48.958 --> 01:28:50.208
Free willy.

01:28:50.292 --> 01:28:52.833
It's only society
that tells us this is wrong.

01:28:52.917 --> 01:28:56.083
And society tends to be wrong
on a lot of things.

01:28:57.542 --> 01:28:59.750
So, live life with no rules?

01:28:59.833 --> 01:29:01.958
- Just like animals?
- More or less, yeah.

01:29:03.375 --> 01:29:06.292
- Have you ever slept with a married woman?
- More than once.

01:29:06.792 --> 01:29:08.250
You're so corrupt.

01:29:10.458 --> 01:29:14.500
Would you let the love of your life go
just because she's married?

01:29:15.083 --> 01:29:18.792
Generally, that's how it's supposed to go.
You're a man of literature.

01:29:18.875 --> 01:29:21.458
You don't just go around
fucking other people's wives.

01:29:21.542 --> 01:29:23.333
- People get killed for this.
- You just did.

01:29:23.417 --> 01:29:25.542
I know and I regret it.

01:29:27.708 --> 01:29:29.667
- Did she give you that shirt?
- Really?

01:29:29.958 --> 01:29:31.667
- I did not know...
- Excuse me.

01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:34.500
- Are you Joel Sab...?
- Sabiti?

01:29:34.625 --> 01:29:36.792
Sure. There's a phone call for you.

01:29:38.417 --> 01:29:39.792
I love your work.

01:29:41.417 --> 01:29:45.542
Hey, Joel Sabiti. Please do get me
a new t-shirt on your way back.

01:29:45.625 --> 01:29:47.500
- Jokes.
- Thank you.

01:29:51.958 --> 01:29:54.125
- Hello?
- Hey, man. What the hell?

01:29:54.208 --> 01:29:56.375
Shit, sorry. My phone died.

01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.500
- What's the vibe?
- The vibe is great.

01:30:00.125 --> 01:30:02.958
The vibe between the old man and my wife.

01:30:03.042 --> 01:30:06.583
Oh, yeah.
I don't think they've shagged yet. No.

01:30:07.333 --> 01:30:09.542
But do they look like they want to shag?

01:30:09.625 --> 01:30:12.208
It's kind of hard to tell.
I mean, the old man...

01:30:12.542 --> 01:30:15.208
I get the feeling
that he doesn't mind boning her.

01:30:15.292 --> 01:30:16.583
And my wife?

01:30:18.458 --> 01:30:20.875
You know your wife. She's very friendly.

01:30:20.958 --> 01:30:24.083
- You don't have anything to worry about.
- Is she drinking?

01:30:25.083 --> 01:30:27.833
We're all pretty wasted, you know.
Wine. Tequila.

01:30:29.125 --> 01:30:30.000
Fuck.

01:30:30.542 --> 01:30:35.042
Listen, I need you to do me another favor.
I need you to sleep at my house.

01:30:35.250 --> 01:30:37.875
What? No. That's crazy.

01:30:37.958 --> 01:30:41.000
Please. Go home with them,
sleep at my house.

01:30:41.083 --> 01:30:43.083
Say that you're too drunk to drive.

01:30:43.167 --> 01:30:45.750
- Just...
- I'm already too drunk to drive.

01:30:45.833 --> 01:30:48.042
- Plus my house is close to here.
- Please.

01:30:48.125 --> 01:30:50.833
You know what you need?
You need to relax.

01:30:50.917 --> 01:30:52.083
This is crazy.

01:30:59.458 --> 01:31:00.917
He's probably...

01:31:02.250 --> 01:31:05.542
- Welcome back. So who was that?
- Guess.

01:31:06.708 --> 01:31:09.958
No. Why is she acting so crazy?

01:33:58.792 --> 01:34:00.042
Hello, Mr. Tim?

01:34:00.958 --> 01:34:02.958
Yes, it's Max Matshane here.

01:34:03.042 --> 01:34:05.875
Listen, Mr. Tim,
I'm so sorry to do this to you,

01:34:05.958 --> 01:34:11.125
but something really urgent came up,
and I need to get back to Joburg.

01:34:11.208 --> 01:34:13.833
I'm so sorry to do this to you, Mr. Tim.

01:34:18.083 --> 01:34:19.125
<i>Hey.</i>

01:34:21.792 --> 01:34:24.167
<i>What's up with the 2 a.m. call? You okay?</i>

01:34:24.250 --> 01:34:27.167
<i>I've been trying to call you all morning.
Your phone's been off.</i>

01:34:27.667 --> 01:34:29.458
<i>Yeah, I was in my lecture.</i>

01:34:32.125 --> 01:34:33.125
Excuse me.

01:34:34.083 --> 01:34:35.208
Babe...

01:34:37.667 --> 01:34:40.750
Did you perhaps withdraw two grand
from the account this morning?

01:34:41.792 --> 01:34:46.375
Yeah, I stupidly did my laundry
at the hotel and...

01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:48.250
they charged me out of my ass.

01:34:48.333 --> 01:34:50.792
<i>Should've seen the fight I had
with the manager.</i>

01:34:51.167 --> 01:34:52.208
Two grand?

01:34:52.750 --> 01:34:54.625
For laundry? How much did you do?

01:34:54.708 --> 01:34:58.458
It was a five star place.
You know they like to milk the tourists.

01:34:58.542 --> 01:35:00.542
<i>But don't worry, I'll replace it.</i>

01:35:01.417 --> 01:35:03.417
Okay, so...

01:35:03.917 --> 01:35:06.375
need me to pick you up?
You're back tomorrow, right?

01:35:06.458 --> 01:35:07.708
Or the day after?

01:35:08.500 --> 01:35:11.333
No, don't worry. I'll take the train.

01:35:12.042 --> 01:35:13.958
Okay, then. I love you. Bye.

01:35:19.625 --> 01:35:20.750
Laundry.

01:35:29.167 --> 01:35:31.875
<i>I wouldn't suggest
going into the black areas like Soweto,</i>

01:35:31.958 --> 01:35:35.167
but if you really want to go,
I can organize you a guide.

01:35:35.250 --> 01:35:38.125
He's one of my guys,
he's a black guy, so you should be safe.

01:35:38.208 --> 01:35:41.333
Okay? I'll speak to you guys later.
All right, see you.

01:36:43.625 --> 01:36:44.583
Fuck.

01:37:38.208 --> 01:37:42.458
Control. Sierra Charlie. Can you please
give me a code 11, quickly?

01:38:54.958 --> 01:38:57.417
Yes, hello, ma'am.
Could you please open up for me.

01:38:57.500 --> 01:38:59.833
I forgot my key in my room last night.

01:39:00.708 --> 01:39:03.833
No, I’m sorry sir, I don’t know you.

01:39:04.625 --> 01:39:07.000
But I paid for a room. What the fuck?

01:39:07.750 --> 01:39:11.208
Ma'am. Please. I paid for a fucking room.

01:39:11.875 --> 01:39:14.500
Hey! Fuck!

01:39:19.625 --> 01:39:20.542
Fuck.

01:40:09.458 --> 01:40:10.583
You look like shit.

01:40:11.875 --> 01:40:14.125
What's going on? Your wife was worried.

01:40:14.417 --> 01:40:17.708
Been calling me every hour.
She called the hotel in Cape Town.

01:40:18.208 --> 01:40:19.167
What's going on?

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.583
Can I have some water please?

01:40:24.667 --> 01:40:27.958
Somebody tried to break into your house.
Better call your wife.

01:40:28.625 --> 01:40:32.000
Relax. It was me who tried to break in.

01:40:33.583 --> 01:40:35.500
What? Why?

01:40:44.917 --> 01:40:47.208
I just wanted to catch them red-handed.

01:40:48.458 --> 01:40:51.208
- I know, I'm an asshole.
- Yeah.

01:40:51.958 --> 01:40:52.833
Why?

01:40:54.750 --> 01:40:58.625
'Cause people are cheating out there.
Why wouldn't they be cheating?

01:41:00.000 --> 01:41:02.708
It's a cheat-athon.
Even you're involved in the cheating.

01:41:02.792 --> 01:41:06.375
No. Tabitha's the one cheating.
I'm just participating.

01:41:06.917 --> 01:41:07.958
In the cheating.

01:41:08.292 --> 01:41:11.958
But as a participant.
Why didn't you just come here last night?

01:41:12.208 --> 01:41:16.000
- Because you're a big mouth.
- No fucking way. I can keep a secret.

01:41:16.083 --> 01:41:17.250
No, you can't.

01:41:19.042 --> 01:41:20.000
Can't.

01:41:23.083 --> 01:41:24.333
I'm scared, man.

01:41:25.042 --> 01:41:27.042
I'm scared I'm going to lose her.

01:41:28.750 --> 01:41:29.833
I'm terrified.

01:41:35.500 --> 01:41:36.917
Come. Come.

01:41:37.958 --> 01:41:38.792
Come.

01:41:52.958 --> 01:41:53.792
Yeah.

01:41:55.000 --> 01:42:00.000
You know, let's get you cleaned up.
You can call your wife. Yeah?

01:42:00.375 --> 01:42:02.458
Let's put some soap, some water...

01:42:03.833 --> 01:42:05.083
You'll feel like a new man.

01:42:09.292 --> 01:42:10.792
Shower. Soap.

01:42:36.292 --> 01:42:38.792
Yeah, I think maybe I'll leave
the two of you alone.

01:42:39.042 --> 01:42:41.708
She's my friend. You're both my friends.

01:42:52.917 --> 01:42:54.000
I can explain.

01:42:57.083 --> 01:42:58.000
Then do it.

01:43:14.667 --> 01:43:16.667
So, what were you going to do?

01:43:18.333 --> 01:43:19.583
If you'd found us.

01:43:22.417 --> 01:43:23.292
I don't know.

01:43:25.708 --> 01:43:27.292
Pop a Glock in your ass?

01:43:29.333 --> 01:43:31.167
You do realize this is serious?

01:43:33.333 --> 01:43:35.333
We clearly have trust issues.

01:43:39.458 --> 01:43:42.042
Do I come across
as somebody who doesn't love you?

01:43:44.917 --> 01:43:45.792
Max?

01:43:47.625 --> 01:43:48.750
This isn't a game.

01:43:53.333 --> 01:43:54.917
Are you serious? You...

01:43:59.042 --> 01:44:01.333
I don't know. What am I supposed to think?

01:44:03.333 --> 01:44:04.333
You know?

01:44:06.042 --> 01:44:09.833
I spent time with this guy.
He's fucking everything that moves.

01:44:10.667 --> 01:44:15.125
I bring him into my house. Next thing,
you're enjoying every hour with him.

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:21.208
What am I supposed to think?
He almost died from fucking people.

01:44:28.583 --> 01:44:29.833
What were you doing?

01:44:32.625 --> 01:44:34.292
While he was fucking people.

01:44:36.292 --> 01:44:38.750
Did you just sit there and watch TV?

01:44:45.458 --> 01:44:47.083
Max, what were you doing?

01:44:57.292 --> 01:44:59.417
So what, it never crossed your mind?

01:45:00.375 --> 01:45:02.250
That's if you haven't fucked him already.

01:45:02.333 --> 01:45:05.083
Are you listening to yourself right now?

01:45:13.792 --> 01:45:16.292
You know what? I can't do this right now.

01:45:19.542 --> 01:45:20.833
We need some time.

01:45:21.875 --> 01:45:22.708
For a while.

01:45:27.500 --> 01:45:28.750
We're married.

01:46:29.625 --> 01:46:33.375
Max. Where have you been, Matshane? Jesus.

01:46:33.750 --> 01:46:35.542
We were worried sick about you.

01:46:35.625 --> 01:46:40.417
- I'm fine. Do you have a moment?
- Yeah, sure. Can I catch you later?

01:46:40.875 --> 01:46:41.833
Okay, then.

01:46:42.708 --> 01:46:45.458
So, have you started work on the book?

01:46:45.542 --> 01:46:48.667
No, I'm sort of trying
to figure out what to...

01:46:49.208 --> 01:46:51.125
what to write about. You know.

01:46:51.750 --> 01:46:54.625
You know, Max,
the path of the writer is a lonely one.

01:46:55.792 --> 01:46:58.667
I don't think you want to talk to me
about the book, do you?

01:46:59.375 --> 01:47:01.458
I know what it is you want to tell me.

01:47:02.542 --> 01:47:05.708
You want to tell me
that I overstayed my welcome.

01:47:06.542 --> 01:47:08.417
And I'm sorry for that, Max.

01:47:08.958 --> 01:47:12.417
I don't think I can ever repay
you and your wife for your hospitality.

01:47:13.208 --> 01:47:15.333
I just needed the company.

01:47:15.417 --> 01:47:19.667
It's fine. That's fine.
I just want to ask you a question, but...

01:47:20.708 --> 01:47:22.708
I don't know how to put this.

01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:28.792
Did you get intimate with my wife?

01:47:29.958 --> 01:47:32.542
Well, of course. I got intimate with you.

01:47:32.625 --> 01:47:35.875
I've been intimate with my colleagues.
I'm an intimate man.

01:47:35.958 --> 01:47:37.625
Come on. You know what I mean.

01:47:37.708 --> 01:47:40.833
- No, Max. Why don't you spell it out?
- Okay, fine.

01:47:41.917 --> 01:47:43.375
Did you fuck my wife?

01:47:45.250 --> 01:47:48.458
This is the problem with your generation.
You're obsessed with sex.

01:47:48.542 --> 01:47:51.000
It makes you lose sight
of the important things.

01:47:51.833 --> 01:47:54.125
- You love your wife, yes?
- Yes. A lot.

01:47:55.708 --> 01:47:58.833
And I can tell you with surety
that she loves you.

01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:03.417
When you're an old man
and you feel as strongly as you do now,

01:48:03.500 --> 01:48:06.792
what do you think it's gonna matter
who she fucked in her 30s?

01:48:06.875 --> 01:48:10.625
Look, it's a simple question.
Did you or did you not fuck my wife?

01:48:11.458 --> 01:48:13.833
- It's a closure thing for me.
- Max.

01:48:13.917 --> 01:48:16.958
I would never do that
to someone I considered a friend.

01:48:17.583 --> 01:48:19.875
You have been nothing but kind to me.

01:48:22.208 --> 01:48:24.208
And yet, you still seem uneasy.

01:48:24.958 --> 01:48:26.500
Hang on. Wait a minute.

01:48:26.583 --> 01:48:28.792
You know, I'm pretty old.
My memory's a bit...

01:48:29.458 --> 01:48:31.792
Maybe I did fuck your wife.

01:48:31.875 --> 01:48:34.542
Now you're angry. Now you want to kill me.
For what?

01:48:34.625 --> 01:48:35.875
For words.

01:48:35.958 --> 01:48:39.750
You believed me when I said I didn't.
Now you believe me when I said I did.

01:48:40.583 --> 01:48:44.125
- Did you do it or did you not?
- It doesn't matter.

01:48:44.500 --> 01:48:46.458
She said she didn't. I said I didn't.

01:48:46.542 --> 01:48:48.875
You don't want it to have happened.
So choose that.

01:48:48.958 --> 01:48:50.750
It's a very simple choice you have.

01:48:51.125 --> 01:48:54.208
You are letting your ego
get in the way of your life.

01:48:54.875 --> 01:48:56.042
You know your wife.

01:48:56.833 --> 01:48:59.375
Do you seriously think
she would fuck me?

01:49:00.458 --> 01:49:03.750
Obviously you think she would
because we're having this conversation.

01:49:03.833 --> 01:49:05.542
I'm flattered but...

01:49:06.583 --> 01:49:08.958
Look at this. This is a beautiful moment.

01:49:09.375 --> 01:49:13.292
To watch another man confront
a man and say, "Did you fuck my wife?"

01:49:13.375 --> 01:49:16.667
This is fucking primal. This is real.

01:49:16.750 --> 01:49:19.917
You, my friend, are alive right now
and so am I.

01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.125
Is this a joke to you?
Is this some sort of philosophical prank?

01:49:25.208 --> 01:49:28.333
- This is my fucking life.
- Yeah, so don't screw it up.

01:49:29.125 --> 01:49:32.917
Know what? I see the beginnings
of a beautiful story here.

01:49:33.208 --> 01:49:34.292
Can't wait to read it.

01:49:36.750 --> 01:49:39.625
- Fuck, I'm sorry.
- Fuck.

01:49:39.708 --> 01:49:44.000
- Shit, sorry. I'm so sorry.
- What's wrong with you, man?

01:49:44.375 --> 01:49:47.667
You have this condescending voice.
I got worked up.

01:49:47.750 --> 01:49:49.167
- Jesus Christ.
- Are you okay?

01:49:49.250 --> 01:49:53.417
I'm okay, I'm okay. Have you got a mirror?
Can you give me a show?

01:49:53.500 --> 01:49:56.000
Look at that, man. Max!

01:49:56.375 --> 01:50:01.875
I'm sorry. I just got overwhelmed
by your condescending tone.

01:50:01.958 --> 01:50:03.583
- I'm sorry.
- What the hell?

01:51:05.333 --> 01:51:08.583
- You didn't leave the spoons, right?
- No, I packed all of that stuff.

01:51:08.667 --> 01:51:10.000
That'd be too much.

01:51:11.583 --> 01:51:12.417
Yeah.

01:51:13.583 --> 01:51:15.250
I'm gonna miss this place.

01:51:16.583 --> 01:51:18.958
Hey, it's not forever, right?

01:51:23.875 --> 01:51:25.792
What's the story with travel arrangements?

01:51:27.833 --> 01:51:29.500
So, let me show you.

01:51:31.875 --> 01:51:33.083
Check this out.

01:51:34.750 --> 01:51:36.500
Bureau Chief Asia.

01:51:36.583 --> 01:51:39.458
Based in Shanghai.
Tokyo's around the corner.

01:51:39.542 --> 01:51:42.500
"I hope you choke on
that fucking Tokyo." What?

01:51:42.583 --> 01:51:46.000
- Haters are gonna hate.
- I'm proud of you. Bring it in.

01:51:58.083 --> 01:52:00.333
- So what are you going to do?
- Yeah.

01:52:00.417 --> 01:52:04.000
Heiner didn't press charges.
So I'm grateful to him.

01:52:04.833 --> 01:52:09.292
And the university still won't let me
on the premises.

01:52:09.875 --> 01:52:13.292
But understandably so.
Can't blame them really.

01:52:13.375 --> 01:52:16.125
- At least now you'll get time to write.
- Yeah.

01:52:16.208 --> 01:52:20.333
Yes. Finally got rid of gainful employment
and a regular paycheck.

01:52:21.250 --> 01:52:23.917
- That's awesome.
- You'll make a plan. You always do.

01:52:24.167 --> 01:52:26.042
That's what your mama said.

01:52:30.542 --> 01:52:31.500
Thanks.

01:52:34.500 --> 01:52:35.542
So...

01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:38.083
Are you going to be cool with your stuff?

01:52:38.167 --> 01:52:40.958
Yeah, Sophie's gonna be here
any time now.

01:52:41.042 --> 01:52:43.042
All right. Guess this is it then.

01:52:44.042 --> 01:52:47.000
- Yeah.
- Skype and write letters.

01:52:48.417 --> 01:52:50.792
Emails. Postcards.

01:52:54.792 --> 01:52:56.042
I'm going to miss that.

01:52:57.125 --> 01:52:59.750
- Bye, Max.
- Yo, actually...

01:53:01.750 --> 01:53:04.417
I've got two tickets
to Monsieur Bon Bon's concert.

01:53:05.042 --> 01:53:06.375
I know you love him.

01:53:07.083 --> 01:53:12.083
I happen to know him personally.
You know, special tickets. Golden Square.

01:53:12.167 --> 01:53:14.250
- Golden Circle.
- Yeah, that one.

01:53:15.542 --> 01:53:17.208
Those are hard to come by.
