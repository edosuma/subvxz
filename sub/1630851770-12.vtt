FOR HIS PAST, OR FOR EVEN
TRYING TO PROTECT COOP,

09:18.993 --> 09:21.473
BUT BILLY'S ACTIONS
MEANT THAT PREACH

09:21.517 --> 09:24.564
WAS ON SCHOOL PROPERTY
WHEN HE GOT ARRESTED!

09:24.607 --> 09:27.567
JABARI WAS TRAUMATIZED,
GOD KNOWS WHO ELSE!

09:27.610 --> 09:30.221
OLIVIA: NO DISRESPECT,
MS. GRACE, BUT I--I MEAN,
THERE'S NO WAY

09:30.265 --> 09:32.223
THAT MY DAD COULD HAVE KNOWN
THAT THIS WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

09:32.267 --> 09:34.661
THIS IS JUST
PREACH'S PAST
CATCHING UP WITH HIM.

09:34.704 --> 09:37.664
THIS IS THE LAST THING
THESE KIDS NEEDED TO SEE,

09:37.707 --> 09:41.581
WAS ANOTHER BLACK MAN
BEING DRAGGED OFF
TO JAIL BY THE COPS.

09:45.846 --> 09:49.327
EXCUSE ME,
WHILE I GO TELL AMINA

09:49.371 --> 09:53.114
WHY HER FATHER ISN'T
COMING HOME TONIGHT.

09:56.204 --> 09:59.990
SPENCER: YO, WHAT HAPPENED?
DID A WITNESS COME FORWARD?
COOP: AFTER ALL THESE MONTHS?

10:00.034 --> 10:02.210
I MEAN, THAT'S HOW
IT WORKS SOMETIMES
IN CASES LIKE THIS.

10:02.253 --> 10:04.516
MAN, WITNESS OR NO WITNESS,
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

10:04.560 --> 10:06.388
UNLESS THE WITNESS
SAW IT DIFFERENT.

10:06.431 --> 10:08.390
YO, WHOSE SIDE
ARE YOU ON?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.871
SERIOUSLY?
ARE YOU--

10:10.914 --> 10:13.264
ARE YOU
REALLY ASKING ME
THAT RIGHT NOW?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.397
I AM ON
YOUR SIDE, COOP.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.400
I HAVE
ALWAYS BEEN HERE,
AND THE FACTS ARE

10:18.443 --> 10:20.402
YOUR LIE
HAS BEEN EXPOSED,

10:20.445 --> 10:22.839
SO WE JUST HAVE
TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT'S NEXT.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.363
LOOK, I JUST WANT
TO MAKE SURE

10:25.407 --> 10:27.931
AMINA'S STRAIGHT,
ALL RIGHT? SHE DIDN'T
ASK FOR ANY OF THIS.

10:27.975 --> 10:30.760
- SHE'S WITH MY MOM RIGHT NOW.
- DOES PREACH HAVE ANY FAMILY?

10:30.804 --> 10:32.762
COOP: I AM PREACH'S FAMILY.
PATIENCE: MMM. YEAH, WELL,

10:32.806 --> 10:35.330
THERE'S NO WAY
THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE
TO RAISE AMINA

10:35.373 --> 10:37.375
IF PREACH GOES DOWN FOR THIS.
SPENCER: ALL RIGHT, LOOK,

10:37.419 --> 10:39.290
HE NEEDS
A DAMN GOOD LAWYER.

10:39.334 --> 10:41.728
THE SOONER PREACH
GETS OUT, THE SOONER
AMINA'S GONNA BE OK.

10:41.771 --> 10:45.296
DO YOU--DO YOU THINK YOUR--
YOUR MOM WOULD DEFEND HIM?

10:45.340 --> 10:47.647
I--I DON'T KNOW,
BUT, I MEAN,
SHE'S FAMILIAR

10:47.690 --> 10:50.650
WITH THE CASE, SO...
SPENCER: IT CAN'T HURT TO TRY.

[DOOR OPENS]

11:06.187 --> 11:08.668
[DOOR CLANGS SHUT]

11:08.711 --> 11:11.366
[SCOFFS]
LET ME GUESS.
COOP HIT YOU WITH

11:11.409 --> 11:13.847
THE SAD-ASS
PUPPY-DOG EYES,
AND HERE YOU ARE--

11:13.890 --> 11:16.110
THE MOUTHPIECE
THAT'S GONNA GET
THESE SHACKLES OFF ME.

11:16.153 --> 11:18.503
"THANK YOU" WOULD BE
A GOOD PLACE TO START.

11:18.547 --> 11:20.680
COME ON, MAN.
YOU KNOW THAT SHOOTING
WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

11:20.723 --> 11:23.552
I SHOULD BE
OUTTA HERE BY DINNER.
LAURA: NOT SO FAST.

11:23.595 --> 11:26.250
AT BEST, IT WAS
JUSTIFIABLE HOMICIDE.

11:26.294 --> 11:28.513
AT WORST, YOU'RE
LOOKING AT 25 TO LIFE.

11:28.557 --> 11:30.820
- HOW?
- BECAUSE A WITNESS
CAME FORWARD,

11:30.864 --> 11:33.693
RECORDED YOU SHOOTING MO.
PREACH: HE'S JUST NOW
SAYING SOMETHING?

11:33.736 --> 11:36.565
HE JUST GOT ARRESTED
FOR POSSESSION
OF NARCOTICS.

11:36.608 --> 11:38.045
SO HE MAKES A DEAL,

11:38.088 --> 11:40.177
SNITCHES
ON ME IN EXCHANGE
FOR HIS FREEDOM?

11:40.221 --> 11:42.702
I'M STILL WAITING
FOR THE EVIDENCE
TO BE RELEASED TO ME,

11:42.745 --> 11:44.704
BUT BASED ON WHAT I'M
HEARING, THE PHOTO IS

11:44.747 --> 11:46.836
JUST OF YOU POINTING
THE GUN AT MO,

11:46.880 --> 11:49.665

PICKED UP ONE GUNSHOT.

11:49.709 --> 11:53.190
- YOU MEAN GUNSHOTS.
- ONE. SINGULAR.

11:53.234 --> 11:56.585
THE VIDEO ONLY SHOWS
YOU SHOOTING MO
FROM THE ALLEY.

11:59.370 --> 12:02.025
THERE'S NO EVIDENCE
SHE SHOT COOP FIRST.

12:02.069 --> 12:04.636
EXACTLY,
AND THAT IS ENOUGH

12:04.680 --> 12:07.074
FOR THE PROSECUTION
TO PUSH FOR MURDER.

12:07.117 --> 12:09.380
OF COURSE IT IS.

12:09.424 --> 12:12.862
I'M THE WRONG COMPLEXION

WHERE I COME IN.

AT THE LABEL.

13:53.702 --> 13:56.705

BAD FOR MR. KEATING?

FIRST--FIRST HE HANDS ME
ALL THE MASTERS
TO MY MOM'S SONGS,

13:59.751 --> 14:02.406
WHICH WAS AWESOME,
OK, BUT THEN HE
HANDS ME THIS LIST

THAT HE THINKS I
SHOULD SIGN TO MY LABEL.

OF THESE ARTISTS, JORDAN.

NOT YET, OK?

14:32.697 --> 14:35.657

TO TWIST MY ARM A LITTLE,

18:17.008 --> 18:19.489
WHY AIN'T COACH

18:19.533 --> 18:21.491
DO YOU THINK BEING
A PRINCIPAL MEANS MORE

TO HAPPEN AT SOUTH CRENSHAW.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.989
THERE'S JUST SO MUCH
STACKED UP AGAINST ME.

19:25.033 --> 19:27.992
I SHOULD PROBABLY
STEP AWAY. YEAH.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.647
I'LL FINISH

19:30.691 --> 19:33.215
AND THEN I WILL STEP DOWN
AS INTERIM PRINCIPAL.

NOPE. NOPE.

19:34.738 --> 19:38.177

FOR SELF-SABOTAGE,

HAVE TO BE DEFINED
BY MY MISTAKES.

JUST 'CAUSE I SPENT TIME
IN THE SYSTEM

THE SYSTEM IS MY FUTURE.

THE POSSIBILITY OF WHAT
MY FUTURE COULD LOOK LIKE,
