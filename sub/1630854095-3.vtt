42:48.174 --> 42:49.871
Yeah.

42:49.915 --> 42:52.787
But I'd always heard Bravo was
the domain of one man only.

42:53.658 --> 42:55.398
The legendary Jason Hayes.

42:55.442 --> 42:56.791
And?

42:56.835 --> 42:58.924
Surprised to see
that Captain America

42:58.967 --> 43:00.621
leans on the rest
of the Avengers.

43:00.665 --> 43:03.232
Hmm. Yeah, well,

43:03.276 --> 43:04.712
trust me.

43:04.756 --> 43:07.106
They know whose team it is,
right?

43:12.328 --> 43:15.680
Thanks. We're, uh, we're RTB.

43:15.723 --> 43:17.769
How far a trip is it?

43:20.032 --> 43:21.120
Sorry.

43:22.382 --> 43:25.777
Welcome you into our home,
can't even know where yours is.

43:25.820 --> 43:27.648
Are all American streets
one-way?

43:27.692 --> 43:29.128
Uh, well,

43:29.171 --> 43:31.304
we were kind of hoping we could
pave a two-way deal.

43:32.218 --> 43:34.263
I mean, you've got information
about this region

43:34.307 --> 43:36.265
that could really shine
a bright light for us.

43:36.309 --> 43:37.963
Yeah, you help us, we help you.

43:39.878 --> 43:41.401
I suppose that could work.

43:41.444 --> 43:42.707
JASON:
Mm-hmm.

43:42.750 --> 43:44.665
I'll offer this to start.

43:44.709 --> 43:48.277
Those enemy we locked up today
were a drop in the ocean.

43:48.321 --> 43:49.801
There's plenty of ISIS around.

43:49.844 --> 43:52.020
Along with regime forces,

43:52.064 --> 43:55.807
Turkish FSA, Chechens,
al-Sham Brigade.

43:59.375 --> 44:02.248
Could be from any of those
neighbors I just mentioned.

44:04.032 --> 44:05.686
They all taking shots at you?

44:05.730 --> 44:07.775
Now, it seems,
they also take shots at you.

44:07.819 --> 44:11.039
Our enemies have become
your enemies.

44:11.997 --> 44:14.303
New guy got us into this, right?

44:14.347 --> 44:18.656
Omar just put a big fucking
target on Bravo.
