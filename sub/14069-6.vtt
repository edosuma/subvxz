it's to be normal.

and then we got in a fight.

you picked a fight with Kevin

12:16.638 --> 12:18.071

without enough bait.

this entire action dismissed.

told me why.

16:36.546 --> 16:38.312

one shot at dismissal,

but I'm pretty much done
drafting this motion.

25:16.446 --> 25:17.712
So I'll need you to proof it--

25:17.747 --> 25:18.824
Harvey, before I do that,
I think you should take

25:18.848 --> 25:20.381
a look at these.

25:20.614 --> 25:22.513
- What is it?
- Cahill issued subpoenas

25:22.549 --> 25:24.682
to deposition William Sutter
and Kevin Miller.

25:24.718 --> 25:27.518
- That sneaky son of a bitch.
- Why are you smiling?

25:27.554 --> 25:28.953
Because last night
I went to Cahill

25:28.989 --> 25:31.823
and tried to give him
Sutter's trading program.

25:32.057 --> 25:33.623
- You did what?
- It was the only way

25:33.659 --> 25:35.992
I could see to stop the case
from getting dismissed,

25:36.028 --> 25:37.094
but he wouldn't take it.

25:37.642 --> 25:39.108
And this buys you time.

25:39.143 --> 25:41.377
It does, if the judge
waits to rule on our motion

25:41.412 --> 25:44.046
until after Cahill conducts
these depositions.

25:44.082 --> 25:46.160
Harvey, even if that works,
what if Cahill doesn't get

25:46.184 --> 25:48.162
enough from the depositions
to keep the case alive?

25:48.186 --> 25:50.064
Then Mike's chance of getting
out of prison is gone,

25:50.088 --> 25:51.721
which means Cahill's
not the only one

25:51.756 --> 25:54.924
that needs to use this
to try and get something.

25:57.838 --> 25:59.504
I have to admit, Ms. Zane,
when you said

25:59.566 --> 26:01.778
you were looking into the Bailey
case, my interest was piqued.

26:01.802 --> 26:04.002
That was a long time ago.

26:04.037 --> 26:05.482
Well, you've obviously
come a long way

26:05.506 --> 26:07.272
since your public defender days.

26:07.307 --> 26:10.408
You don't exactly see the best
of humanity at that job,

26:10.444 --> 26:12.911
which makes it one
you can only do for so long.

26:12.946 --> 26:15.247
But you didn't come here
to be my therapist.

26:15.282 --> 26:18.316
No, I came to talk
about Maria Gomez.

26:18.352 --> 26:19.551
What about her?

26:19.586 --> 26:21.620
I'm curious as to how you
can have an alibi witness

26:21.655 --> 26:22.621
on a murder case,

26:22.656 --> 26:24.096
and your client ends up
on death row.

26:24.203 --> 26:26.103
Because I didn't have
an alibi witness.

26:26.138 --> 26:27.971
I had a no-show
who vanished into thin air,

26:28.007 --> 26:30.150
and I didn't have the resources
to find her.

26:30.250 --> 26:32.250
And you didn't think
to ask the police at trial

26:32.285 --> 26:34.252
why they didn't follow up
on Leonard's alibi?

26:34.287 --> 26:35.386
I did think of it,

26:35.422 --> 26:36.966
and they would have said
what they always say,

26:36.990 --> 26:39.101
"Every murderer claims
to have an alibi,"

26:39.201 --> 26:41.235
and if I couldn't produce her,
why should they?

26:41.270 --> 26:42.814
Well, you could have
at least asked for postponement,

26:42.838 --> 26:44.071
to have time to find her.

26:44.106 --> 26:45.739
And I would have,
except for one thing.

26:45.774 --> 26:48.075
I wasn't sure a drug addict
with a prior conviction

26:48.110 --> 26:50.310
would have done
Leonard Bailey much good.

26:50.722 --> 26:52.855
That's about her character,
not the facts of the case.

26:52.890 --> 26:55.224
Her character is
a fact of the case,

26:55.259 --> 26:56.670
and when I pressed her
as to what the two of them

26:56.694 --> 26:58.105
were doing at the time
of those murders,

26:58.129 --> 27:00.096
she admitted they were
both on meth,

27:00.131 --> 27:01.564
and it wasn't the first time.

27:01.599 --> 27:03.599
Which, by the way,
might have something to do with

27:03.635 --> 27:06.068
why she never
showed up at trial.

27:06.549 --> 27:09.450
So you can try to reopen
this case if you want, Ms. Zane,

27:09.485 --> 27:13.854

It was because I found out the
