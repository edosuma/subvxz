00:00.001 --> 00:03.268
- <i>Previously on</i> the strain.
- You know, I was getting on

00:03.270 --> 00:05.771
The subway today and I did see,
like, 10 rats on the platform.

00:05.773 --> 00:08.774
- Rats don't migrate like that.
Something was driving them out

00:08.776 --> 00:10.676
Of their nest.
- (lauretta): Like what?

00:10.678 --> 00:13.612
- A bigger predator. Oh shit.

00:13.614 --> 00:17.282
(speaking a foreign language)

00:17.284 --> 00:19.351
- Oh god!
We were talking

00:19.353 --> 00:21.487
About finding a cure.
- That was before we knew

00:21.489 --> 00:24.156
How quickly it spread.
- But this isn't my home.

00:24.158 --> 00:26.625
- I'll lie down with you
until you fall asleep.

00:26.627 --> 00:29.128
What's going on?

00:29.130 --> 00:32.531
We have to go! Come on!
- What?

00:32.533 --> 00:35.734
- We need to lock down anyone
related to the plane casualties.

00:35.736 --> 00:39.505
I have empirical proof that
the victims are returning home

00:39.507 --> 00:42.808
And infecting their families.
- They have you on video

00:42.810 --> 00:45.344
Dragging redfern's body
down the hallway.

00:45.346 --> 00:47.913
- I have to get out of here.
- Drop your phone,

00:47.915 --> 00:51.116
I'll see what I can do.

00:58.358 --> 01:03.429

I need you to last me
a few meals more.

03:33.580 --> 03:35.781
(tock! Tock! Tock!)

03:40.420 --> 03:42.421
- Kelly goodweather?
I'm special agent monroe,

03:42.423 --> 03:45.090
This is special agent
woodbridge. Fbi.

03:45.092 --> 03:47.359
- Ok.
- We're looking for your husband

03:47.361 --> 03:49.695
Dr. Ephraim goodweather.
Is he here by any chance?

03:49.697 --> 03:54.066
- No. Um, we're separated.
- Oh sorry to hear that.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.668
We've been having trouble
reaching him.

04:03.409 --> 04:05.744
Well, do you know where he is
right now or how we can

04:05.746 --> 04:09.915
Get in contact with him?
- I... I have his phone number.

04:09.917 --> 04:12.351
- No his cellphone
has gone dark.

04:12.353 --> 04:15.087
- Wait, is eph ok? Does this
have something to do

04:15.089 --> 04:17.522
With the airplane?
- It does, yeah.

04:17.524 --> 04:20.959
- What's going on?
- Fbi. I'm agent monroe

04:20.961 --> 04:22.894
And this is agent woodbridge.

04:22.896 --> 04:26.031
We're looking for ephraim
goodweather. And you are?

04:26.033 --> 04:29.701
- Matt sayles, kelly's
boyfriend. What's the matter?

04:29.703 --> 04:31.703
- You know what, matt,
I've got it. If you want to go

04:31.705 --> 04:33.905
Check on zack, make sure
he doesn't wander over.

04:33.907 --> 04:36.441
- If dr. Goodweather gets
in touch with either one of you,

04:36.443 --> 04:38.910
We'd appreciate it
if you contacted us immediately.

04:38.912 --> 04:42.481
- If you don't mind, I have
to get my son off to school.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.656
- You think he's in there?
- With his wife's boyfriend

04:50.658 --> 04:54.359
In the house?
Eh, not a chance.

04:56.896 --> 04:59.097
- Can only be Thursday,
can it?

04:59.099 --> 05:01.566
- You jammed up to?
- Office's so flooded

05:01.568 --> 05:03.468
With calls, we're referring
business to the competition,

05:03.470 --> 05:05.604
Who're too busy to take it.
- I know, you dope.

05:05.606 --> 05:08.907
I'm the competition.
- Something's going on.

05:08.909 --> 05:12.744
One of the mafia - 'scuse me,
the sanitation department -

05:12.746 --> 05:14.680
Forget to do their
trash pick-up this week?

05:14.682 --> 05:16.648
- I was on a roof in mott haven
yesterday, a whole squad

05:16.650 --> 05:18.750
Of munchers livin' up there,
like pigeons.

05:18.752 --> 05:20.752
- Yeah, I saw them pourin' out
of a sewer in

05:20.754 --> 05:24.156
Morningside heights. Hundreds.
Like somethin' biblical.

05:24.158 --> 05:27.826
- It's a mass displacement.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.796
Something's driving them out
from underground.

05:30.798 --> 05:35.600
- How you know this, fet?
- I seen 'em. In the tunnels.

05:35.602 --> 05:39.471
- Seen what?
- Something big.

05:39.473 --> 05:42.174
And it's hiding down there
in the dark.

05:42.176 --> 05:45.077
- What? The mole people?
- Ha! Ha! Ha!

05:47.113 --> 05:50.782
- You'd be happy to see the mole
people instead of these things.

05:50.784 --> 05:53.852
- What'd they look like?

06:07.400 --> 06:12.371
- Fsh... I'm just saying
be careful, that's all.

06:12.373 --> 06:15.640
- Hey, fet.
Next time you see 'em,

06:15.642 --> 06:17.909
Thank 'em for all the overtime.
- Yeah. Ha! Ha!

06:17.911 --> 06:20.078
Ha! Ha! Ha!

06:23.750 --> 06:26.918
- â™ª <i>I see 'em coming</i>

(latin rap)
- oh!

06:29.423 --> 06:32.924
Is this boring or what?
- Didn't come here to pitty-pat.

06:32.926 --> 06:36.895
Pretty boy, I never
liked you anyway.

06:40.833 --> 06:45.036
- Now you hurt my feelings.
- Uh oh!

06:45.038 --> 06:46.772
My ride here?

06:46.774 --> 06:49.941
- It is.
I'm here for mr. Elizalde.

06:52.745 --> 06:55.480
- Pitty-pat that.

06:58.284 --> 07:02.587
With who? The queen?
- Mr. Eichhorst.

07:02.589 --> 07:04.689
- Nah, I don't work
for him no more.

07:04.691 --> 07:06.958
You'd better step up
out of here, home boy.

07:06.960 --> 07:09.161
- I'm afraid he insists.

07:14.767 --> 07:21.239
- Alright, man.
Be easy with that heat, eh?

07:21.241 --> 07:24.176
Let me get cleaned up. Felix.

07:26.913 --> 07:29.648
- What's up?
- This guy I used to work for.

07:29.650 --> 07:34.853
Putting the press on me. We gon'
end that shit today, though.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.423
- What did those men want?

07:38.425 --> 07:41.326
- Nothing.
- Is dad in trouble?

07:41.328 --> 07:44.763
- Why do you ask?
- 'cause he's on tv.

07:44.765 --> 07:46.998
- (reporter): <i>Wanted for</i>
<i>questioning by the fbi.</i>

07:47.000 --> 07:49.067

07:49.069 --> 07:51.169

07:56.076 --> 07:58.109
<i>- Redfern apparently went</i>
<i>missing last night</i>

07:58.111 --> 08:01.279
From st. Sebastian's hospital--
- whatever they're saying,

08:01.281 --> 08:03.849
It's completely bogus.

08:06.519 --> 08:08.186
We need to get zack out
of the city right now.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.422
Go to your mother's in vermont.
- Wait-- what the hell are you

08:10.424 --> 08:12.524
Talking about?
- Something awful is happening.

08:12.526 --> 08:15.126
Um... The contagion. It's
a terrible disease, an outbreak.

08:15.128 --> 08:17.596
It's burning its way through
the city and they're trying

08:17.598 --> 08:19.498
To make sure nobody'll
listen to me.

08:19.500 --> 08:23.201
- Is it that bad?
- How did you get in here?

08:23.203 --> 08:28.707
- Just... Just pack a bag.
Throw some clothes in, get out.

08:28.709 --> 08:31.109
- Look, you're scaring me.
- I'm scared. I've never seen

08:31.111 --> 08:34.646
Anything like this. Nobody has.
- If there's some big emergency

08:34.648 --> 08:38.016
Why isn't there any news about
it? Why isn't the government

08:38.018 --> 08:40.652
Warning us instead
of looking for you.

08:40.654 --> 08:43.121
- They're trying to turn it
around on me. Look, I know too

08:43.123 --> 08:46.658
Much. Maybe that sounds crazy.
- You gotta get rid

08:46.660 --> 08:48.693
Of your phone, dad.
They can use it to trace you.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.062
- I did that already.
- Go upstairs and get ready

08:51.064 --> 08:53.698
For school. Upstairs, zack.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.668
- You're scaring me and
you're going to scare your son.

08:56.670 --> 08:59.137
Is it the custody hearing? I
mean, have you finally snapped?

08:59.139 --> 09:02.274
- How many drinks have you had
this morning, eph?

09:04.911 --> 09:07.012
- You know me kelly.
You need to do this.

09:07.014 --> 09:09.080
- Look, you need to stop
giving me orders, ok?

09:09.082 --> 09:12.417
Besides, how many times have you
said "you can't outrun a virus?"

09:12.419 --> 09:14.352
- Well this one,
you need to try.

09:14.354 --> 09:17.589
Look, I wouldn't be saying this
if it wasn't important!

09:17.591 --> 09:20.058
You can take my office,
you can tear it down,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.427
You can turn it into a game
room, I don't give a shit.

09:22.429 --> 09:25.897
But this matters.
(knocking)

09:25.899 --> 09:29.935
- You called the fbi?
- Goddamn fool.

09:29.937 --> 09:32.904
- Take it easy, doctor.
Put your hands behind your head.

09:32.906 --> 09:34.906
- Ok, doc. Stop right there, eh?
- My god, eph.

09:34.908 --> 09:37.509
- We just have a few questions
for you.

09:37.511 --> 09:40.145
- Put your hands
behind your head!

09:48.254 --> 09:50.655
- Run.

09:59.065 --> 10:01.933
- They left with him in the
backseat. I don't think any of

10:01.935 --> 10:04.436
The neighbours noticed anything.
- Why did you do that?

10:04.438 --> 10:06.938
- What? Call the fbi
as they instructed us to do?

10:06.940 --> 10:10.108
What? You want us to be
an accessory to whatever?

10:10.110 --> 10:12.644
- It wasn't your call to make.
- He forced his way

10:12.646 --> 10:15.580
Into our house.
- Into my house! My ex-husband.

10:15.582 --> 10:18.550
And I will decide
how to deal with him.

10:18.552 --> 10:20.619
- Wow you... You're actually
defending him.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.621
- Why did they arrest dad?
- You know what? It was just

10:22.623 --> 10:25.123
A big misunderstanding and
we're going to sort it out.

10:25.125 --> 10:28.994
- Are we going to vermont?
- Know what? Maybe we should.

10:28.996 --> 10:31.997
Just to be safe.
- Are you kidding me?

10:31.999 --> 10:34.799
And do what? You're just going
to pull zack out of school?

10:34.801 --> 10:37.769
And how are you going to find
a substitute for your class

10:37.771 --> 10:40.438
This late? I'm sorry,
but I'm not losing my job

10:40.440 --> 10:43.942
Because your ex went crazy.
- Don't say that about him!

10:43.944 --> 10:47.178
- Zack, just go wait
in the car for me, ok?

10:47.180 --> 10:49.848
- Look, I know you're upset.
With your history--

10:49.850 --> 10:51.816
- No, you shut your mouth
and you listen to me.

10:51.818 --> 10:54.919
This is my family, my life.
I invited you in, you are

10:54.921 --> 10:57.489
A guest and you need to start
acting like one.

10:57.491 --> 11:00.191
- A guest?

11:00.193 --> 11:04.462
- Maybe this was a mistake.
Maybe I acted too quickly.

11:04.464 --> 11:06.765
- No no no. We know what we're
doing here, ok? I'm here.

11:06.767 --> 11:09.934
I'm here because I love you.
I'm here because

11:09.936 --> 11:12.937
I'm trying to protect
this family.

11:12.939 --> 11:18.376
We're way past me being a guest.
- I need to go to work.

11:18.378 --> 11:21.479
- We're not done here!
- I am.

11:21.481 --> 11:26.017
- Fine. Fine, I gotta go
to work too.

11:26.019 --> 11:28.186
- Great.
- Great.

11:28.188 --> 11:33.224
- We've inventory tonight
and it's gonna go late.

11:33.226 --> 11:35.960
- I won't wait up.

13:12.758 --> 13:16.494
(thumping)

13:17.663 --> 13:20.899
(glass breaking under footsteps)

13:45.124 --> 13:48.326
(loud thumping)

13:50.663 --> 13:54.566
(growling)

13:59.271 --> 14:01.506
(loud growling)

14:01.508 --> 14:04.275
(squealing in pain)

14:07.446 --> 14:10.181
- <i>Sabia mea fredonaza argint.</i>

14:23.963 --> 14:26.664
(thumping gets faster.)

14:26.666 --> 14:30.301
Agh... Agh!

14:39.979 --> 14:43.648
(squeals of pain)

14:43.650 --> 14:46.885
- Grrr!

14:53.993 --> 14:57.161
(squealing and growling)

15:01.901 --> 15:05.069
(panting)

15:07.439 --> 15:10.575
- M-- agh--

15:35.367 --> 15:37.535
(vacuum whirring)

15:46.745 --> 15:50.048
- Mama, are you ok?
Do you remember anything

15:50.050 --> 15:54.919
From last night?
- It-- it was a lovely dinner.

15:54.921 --> 15:58.523
- I wish I could forget
like you.

16:02.394 --> 16:04.996
(phone rings)

16:08.167 --> 16:11.269
Hello?
- [nora, it's jim. You alright?]

16:11.271 --> 16:13.571
- I've been better.
Have you heard from eph?

16:13.573 --> 16:16.274
- [what? You don't know?]
he took redfern's autopsy video

16:16.276 --> 16:18.276
To barnes who put
the fbi on him.

16:18.278 --> 16:20.178
[he's been arrested.]
- arrested?

16:20.180 --> 16:24.015
- Who's been arrested?
- [for murder.]

16:24.017 --> 16:26.250
- Don't they see what's
happening?

16:26.252 --> 16:28.953
This doesn't make any sense.
(beep!)

16:28.955 --> 16:32.657
(jim's voice becomes garbled.)
- nora? Nora?!

16:32.659 --> 16:35.259
- Jim?
- [nora-- are... There?]

16:35.261 --> 16:38.029
(beep!)
- jim, I'm losing you. Don't!

16:38.031 --> 16:41.132
Mama, don't open the door!
- Nora! You're hurting me again.

16:41.134 --> 16:43.101
- I'm sorry.
- Are they making people

16:43.103 --> 16:44.936
Disappear?
(beep! Beep!)

16:44.938 --> 16:47.705
- We have to go.
(beep!)

16:47.707 --> 16:50.108
(beep! Beep!)

17:04.857 --> 17:07.392
â™ª

17:08.894 --> 17:13.865
- â™ª <i>I said come on, come on</i>
<i>look happy</i> â™ª

17:13.867 --> 17:16.868
- Hey. Don't die in my cab.

17:16.870 --> 17:20.138
- Thank you for your concern.

17:21.507 --> 17:24.475
- Harlem is a long fare.
You got money?

17:26.145 --> 17:28.913
- I have money. Just...

17:28.915 --> 17:32.717
Get me home before this eclipse.

17:33.752 --> 17:37.221
- This eclipse is making
everyone nuts.

17:37.223 --> 17:40.258
The plane thing and cellphones
aren't working.

17:40.260 --> 17:42.827
The whole city's losing their
minds, it's like judgement day

17:42.829 --> 17:45.196
Out there.

17:45.198 --> 17:49.000
- You wanna help fix this?

17:49.002 --> 17:53.671
You wanna help me
stop all of this?

17:54.907 --> 17:59.744
- You can't fix crazy, man.
You can't.

17:59.746 --> 18:02.213
- â™ª <i>come on, come on</i> â™ª

18:02.215 --> 18:06.417
â™ª <i>look happy</i> â™ª

18:11.090 --> 18:14.425
- The hell are we, man?
- One story above hell.

18:14.427 --> 18:19.564
This idiot's the devil's butler.
You got my gun on you?

18:19.566 --> 18:22.133
- Yeah.

18:23.735 --> 18:27.438
- Ah, you brought a friend.

18:27.440 --> 18:32.210
- Look, slick. I told you.
I'm out.

18:32.212 --> 18:34.579
What do I gotta do
to convince you that I'm done?

18:34.581 --> 18:39.383
- Gus. You violated one of
the three rules. You attempted

18:39.385 --> 18:42.286
To take some of the cargo.
The deal we made

18:42.288 --> 18:46.390
Therefore is no longer valid.
But you remain in my employ.

18:46.392 --> 18:48.392
- I didn't look in that box.

18:48.394 --> 18:51.963
- We're not going
to debate the issue.

18:51.965 --> 18:54.132
Here is your new assignment:

18:54.134 --> 18:56.567
In the basement
of st. Sebastian's hospital,

18:56.569 --> 18:59.303
You will find the refrigerated
remains of a body.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.807
An associate will pick you up
and take you to this body.

19:02.809 --> 19:06.410
You will remove it
from the hospital premises

19:06.412 --> 19:08.579
And you will dispose of it.

19:08.581 --> 19:12.984
I trust you know of a secure
location for such a task.

19:12.986 --> 19:15.853
- I don't think
you're hearing me.

19:15.855 --> 19:17.655
(speaks in spanish.)

19:17.657 --> 19:22.293
<i>Vamanos. Si Ã©l nos trata</i>
<i>de parar, lo matamos.</i>

19:22.295 --> 19:27.532
- <i>Por esto, se te pagarÃ¡ $800.</i>

19:27.534 --> 19:32.003
<i>Y tu madre no serÃ¡ deportada</i>
<i>de este paÃ­s.</i>

19:32.005 --> 19:35.439
<i>Entiendes?</i>

19:35.441 --> 19:38.142
- You shoulda never
brought her into this.

19:38.144 --> 19:40.478
- You love her very much.

19:40.480 --> 19:44.048
What I find fascinating is
how love is considered a gift,

19:44.050 --> 19:48.986
A blessing, with no acceptance
to the fact that it also binds

19:48.988 --> 19:53.724
And chokes and strangles.

19:57.062 --> 19:59.630
- Shut up, fool. You're over!

20:19.685 --> 20:21.719
Ah-- argh.

20:21.721 --> 20:25.656
- Yes?
- What are you?

20:32.931 --> 20:36.701
- I am your salvation
or your downfall. Your choice.

20:36.703 --> 20:41.072
You're a smart boy, gus.
I doubt you will make

20:41.074 --> 20:45.943
The same mistake again.

20:45.945 --> 20:48.813
Now get going!

21:04.296 --> 21:06.764
(sirens)
(cars honking)

21:09.401 --> 21:14.138
- Everything you've been told is
100% false.

21:14.140 --> 21:17.642
- So you didn't kill
doyle redfern, the pilot?

21:17.644 --> 21:22.913
- No. I did not kill
doyle redfern the pilot.

21:22.915 --> 21:25.549
- Just happened to be dragging
his body down the hallway,

21:25.551 --> 21:28.319
Is that right?
- Look, could you text my son?

21:28.321 --> 21:33.491
You handcuffed me right
in front of him.

21:33.493 --> 21:36.594
You can type it in, I'll dictate
it to you, he just needs to know

21:36.596 --> 21:39.397
That I'm ok.
- Yeah, but I'm not sure

21:39.399 --> 21:41.599
That you are, doc. In fact,
I'm sure that you're not.

21:41.601 --> 21:43.434
Now I'm not going to dick around
with you, you are in a shitstorm

21:43.436 --> 21:45.603
Of trouble here and the best
thing you can do for yourself

21:45.605 --> 21:47.605
Is to tell me the truth.
- Look, I know that this is

21:47.607 --> 21:49.607
The way that you do things but
we really just don't have time

21:49.609 --> 21:51.642
For this shit.
- That's all you got is time,

21:51.644 --> 21:54.011
Fella.
- No, I don't. We don't.

21:54.013 --> 21:56.914
These hours are crucial. We need
daylight to fight these things,

21:56.916 --> 21:59.083
To hunt them. What time is it?

21:59.085 --> 22:02.520
- I don't give a shit who you
are or what fancy medical school

22:02.522 --> 22:06.924
You went to. Now I own you.
Buzz me out.

22:06.926 --> 22:09.360
Let's leave this asshole in here
for a day or two

22:09.362 --> 22:11.829
And let him stew.
(bzzz!)

22:27.612 --> 22:30.848
- You?

22:40.459 --> 22:43.527
What's this?
- Just put 'em on

22:43.529 --> 22:47.164
And don't talk to me.

22:47.166 --> 22:49.934
- Here you go, thanks.

22:51.336 --> 22:54.872
- Cellphone's still out.
- Where are we going?

22:54.874 --> 22:57.908
- I don't know, mama.

22:57.910 --> 23:01.312
But it isn't safe here.
It'll be dark soon...

23:01.314 --> 23:05.983
- Don't be silly <i>mi hija,</i>
<i>it's the middle of the day.</i>

23:07.486 --> 23:10.755
- (vendor): <i>Eclipse glasses!</i>
<i>- Just wait here.</i>

23:10.757 --> 23:14.725
- <i>Just $1. Souvenirs!</i>
<i>Eclipse glasses.</i>

23:14.727 --> 23:17.194
- Excuse me.

23:17.196 --> 23:20.431
I think there's someone
who can help us.

23:22.033 --> 23:25.669
- <i>Protect your eyes! $1.</i>

23:33.745 --> 23:38.582
-  <i>Necesito sentarme, por favor!</i>
<i>- Come on, come on.</i>

23:38.584 --> 23:43.821
We'll be there soon, ok?
- H-- ok.

23:56.535 --> 24:02.907
- You two hear about the house
explosion out in ozone park?

24:02.909 --> 24:06.677
(phones ringing)

24:28.467 --> 24:32.002
Didn't know you had
a little girl.

24:34.339 --> 24:37.475
(rustling)

24:49.120 --> 24:51.155
(beep! Beep! Beep! Beep! Beep!)

24:51.157 --> 24:54.158
(click! Click! Click!)

25:06.104 --> 25:08.539
(door creaks and closes)

25:08.541 --> 25:13.043
Huh. Gonna need something
with a little more punch.

25:13.045 --> 25:16.013
(rats scampering)

25:17.616 --> 25:22.820
Munchers sneaking in
in the enemy headquarters, huh?

25:22.822 --> 25:26.857
(growling)

25:29.227 --> 25:31.962
Boss?

25:35.800 --> 25:38.002
You alright?

25:38.004 --> 25:40.971
- Rah!
(grunting)

25:44.342 --> 25:47.411
- Rrgh! Yah!

25:47.413 --> 25:50.247
(the strigoi squeals.)

25:50.249 --> 25:53.183
Gah!

25:53.185 --> 25:56.820
(sizzling)

26:14.372 --> 26:17.341
H... Ok then.

26:17.343 --> 26:21.779
(growling)

26:22.948 --> 26:26.650
Lauretta...?

26:31.623 --> 26:35.993
(quiet growling)

26:49.941 --> 26:53.344
(thumping)

26:55.413 --> 26:57.781
(squealing)

27:01.286 --> 27:03.754
- You were right. Shoulda waited
a couple of days instead

27:03.756 --> 27:06.624
Of bringing him back in.
- And hearing this bullshit.

27:06.626 --> 27:08.792
- You wanted to hear the whole
story, that's it.

27:08.794 --> 27:12.563
I just gave it to you.
All of it. It's the truth.

27:12.565 --> 27:18.102
- Well, not everything.
What about that guy?

27:18.104 --> 27:21.939
Peter bishop. Head of
airport atc, found dead at jfk.

27:21.941 --> 27:24.141
Was he also one
of these infected people

27:24.143 --> 27:27.778
Who needed to be destroyed?
- How about just for one minute,

27:27.780 --> 27:31.015
You entertain the possibility
that I'm right.

27:31.017 --> 27:34.451
That there is a massive
contagious event rolling through

27:34.453 --> 27:36.954
New york city.
- Ok.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.857
- Well, just go to one
of the passenger's houses.

27:39.859 --> 27:41.825
Just pick one, any one
and see what you find there.

27:41.827 --> 27:46.363
- Let's put this guy
back in his cell.

27:46.365 --> 27:49.933
- Goodbye doctor, we'll see you
in court in five or six months.

27:49.935 --> 27:53.871
- Alright, alright, alright.
I...

27:53.873 --> 27:58.175
I'll take you to the bodies.
I know where the bodies are.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.782
- Are you saying something
different now?

28:04.784 --> 28:07.518
- I am.
- You know where the bodies are?

28:07.520 --> 28:09.987
- I do. All of them.
- Give us an address.

28:09.989 --> 28:12.456
- No, no, no. No address.
I need to show you.

28:12.458 --> 28:14.525
(sighs)
- it's just more bullshit.

28:14.527 --> 28:17.194
- No, no, no.
I want to make a deal.

28:19.898 --> 28:22.900
- If you're jacking us around,
what I did to you before

28:22.902 --> 28:26.070
Was nothing.
- You want answers to

28:26.072 --> 28:29.373
Your questions you're not going
to find them in here.

28:32.877 --> 28:35.079
- As far as I'm concerned,
eclipse is french

28:35.081 --> 28:37.715
For happy hour.

28:37.717 --> 28:41.351
- I've just never
seen eph like that.

28:41.353 --> 28:44.488
- It's a classic cock-block.
"oh, there's just some big city-

28:44.490 --> 28:48.559
"wide emergency, save yourself
and zack, I'm your hero."

28:48.561 --> 28:51.729
- I mean, I just
shut matt down hard.

28:51.731 --> 28:57.167
He was trying to help.
Failing, but trying.

28:57.169 --> 28:59.536
- Hey, what you did was fine.
They need to be put in

28:59.538 --> 29:02.406
Their place from time to time.
- He hasn't called or texted,

29:02.408 --> 29:05.943
I mean, that is so not like him.
- That's male pride.

29:05.945 --> 29:08.045
You think this redecorating
thing is some random

29:08.047 --> 29:10.581
Home improvement? You're lucky
he's not marking his territory

29:10.583 --> 29:13.884
In a more traditional way.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.787
- Maybe I let him move in
too soon.

29:16.789 --> 29:20.891
Maybe I did want to hurt eph.

29:20.893 --> 29:22.960
- Hey. Divorce is
a street fight.

29:22.962 --> 29:26.597
Don't you forget about eph's
spicy side-dish there at work,

29:26.599 --> 29:30.033
Ok? Stay strong.
- Right.

29:31.302 --> 29:35.439
And what if eph's right?
- I don't know...

29:35.441 --> 29:38.308
Then go to vermont. Take a long
weekend if you're stressing out

29:38.310 --> 29:41.245
About it. You don't have to
justify it you don't have to...

29:41.247 --> 29:44.214
You don't have to ask matt's
permission. You go,

29:44.216 --> 29:47.384
You deserve it.
- Right. What about you?

29:47.386 --> 29:49.920
You're not worried that there's
some horrible new epidemic

29:49.922 --> 29:53.957
They're not telling us about?
You want to come with us?

29:53.959 --> 29:58.061
- Nah. Kel, come on. I'm
a queens girl, we never leave.

30:09.841 --> 30:13.944
- Aw man, it's so loose
and nasty in there.

30:13.946 --> 30:17.080
I'm telling you, someone got
their ass chopped up.

30:17.082 --> 30:20.284
Who is it? Mob guy? Politician?

30:20.286 --> 30:22.953
- You don't need to know.
- Leave it alone, felix.

30:22.955 --> 30:25.823
- Nice try, homie.
I gotta see this.

30:25.825 --> 30:29.159
- Hey! Stop! Stop! Stop!
Hey, what are you doing?!

30:30.762 --> 30:34.531
- That shit ain't human.

30:34.533 --> 30:37.167
- Get out of the way!

30:48.012 --> 30:52.049
Goddamnit.
(panting)

30:52.051 --> 30:55.619
- Let's get this over with.

31:32.523 --> 31:36.159
(knocking)

31:40.365 --> 31:45.602
- Pop.
- Vasiliy.

31:50.909 --> 31:55.412
- Mom's not home?
- She's on her way.

31:55.414 --> 31:58.315
Market day.

32:00.551 --> 32:04.888
- Mmm... Pirozkhi.
(chuckling)

32:04.890 --> 32:09.126
Always. Fresh made, huh?

32:12.597 --> 32:16.266
- You need money?

32:18.036 --> 32:21.371
- Sorry to disappoint you.

32:25.643 --> 32:28.645
Still the mad genius
I see, huh?

32:28.647 --> 32:31.181
- It is almost done.

32:34.319 --> 32:37.454
- <i>The history of ukrainian</i>
<i>architecture.</i>

32:37.456 --> 32:40.557
Authored by a man who fled
the country 30 years ago

32:40.559 --> 32:43.994
To never return.
- My book is to be published

32:43.996 --> 32:48.298
In June by the odessa mechnikov
university press.

32:48.300 --> 32:52.436
I have also been invited
to lecture there in odessa,

32:52.438 --> 32:56.473
Kharkiv and kiev in the fall.
- Congratulations.

32:59.777 --> 33:02.012
- And you vasiliy?

33:02.014 --> 33:05.682
Too busy killing rats
to come visit your mother?

33:08.152 --> 33:10.787
- I always wonder
if you'll get past it.

33:10.789 --> 33:16.193
Do mr. And mrs. Yodka still
think I work in city planning?

33:16.195 --> 33:18.862
- I should advertise
what you do?

33:18.864 --> 33:21.431
Is there any gain for me
in telling people

33:21.433 --> 33:25.035
That you turned down
a graduate school scholarship

33:25.037 --> 33:29.439
In architecture at cornell
to become a rat catcher?

33:29.441 --> 33:34.344
- No. Not much.

33:36.280 --> 33:39.182
But I didn't come here to fight.

33:39.184 --> 33:42.152
I came here to warn you.
You and ma.

33:42.154 --> 33:44.454
You need to get out
of this city.

33:44.456 --> 33:46.823
- And why is that?

33:46.825 --> 33:50.460
- Something evil has taken root.

33:50.462 --> 33:54.865
Some disease. Some horrible,
horrible strain.

33:54.867 --> 33:58.035
A pestilence that's
overrunning the city.

33:58.037 --> 34:00.570
It's turning people
into hungry vermin.

34:00.572 --> 34:06.076
- Your job, vasiliy,
it has warped your mind--

34:06.078 --> 34:09.079
- It's the truth.

34:09.081 --> 34:12.816
This is what I do.
This is what I know.

34:15.253 --> 34:18.655
You need to take that vacation
you always promised ma,

34:18.657 --> 34:23.827
But never given her.
You know, you need to go.

34:29.834 --> 34:31.868
I knew this would happen.

34:31.870 --> 34:35.906
- You appear after two years.

34:35.908 --> 34:39.076
And I'm supposed to flee
my home on what?

34:39.078 --> 34:43.146
The word of a stranger.

34:48.753 --> 34:51.855
- I tried.

34:51.857 --> 34:54.791
Goodbye, da.

34:54.793 --> 34:58.728
- Stay. For your mother.

34:58.730 --> 35:02.766
- Go.

35:02.768 --> 35:06.703
For me.

35:14.612 --> 35:18.782
- Thanks. Make sure you put
these on before you look up.

35:25.389 --> 35:30.494
- It's so cool.
- Yeah, I don't like it.

35:30.496 --> 35:34.598
It's a bad omen.

35:34.600 --> 35:38.668
So what should we do, z?
Stay here or go?

35:38.670 --> 35:41.771
- Dad says go.

35:41.773 --> 35:45.509
- I'm sorry you had
to see that this morning.

35:49.447 --> 35:54.651
I'm sorry everything
is so chaotic right now.

35:56.521 --> 36:00.257
Maybe what we both need
is a little normalcy, huh?

36:01.692 --> 36:05.896
No place like home, right?
And you've got school.

36:11.202 --> 36:15.238
I love you.
- I love you, too.

36:48.973 --> 36:52.442
(sirens)
(cars honking)

37:17.768 --> 37:20.904
(beep! Beep! Beep!)
- c'mon.

37:20.906 --> 37:24.841
- Why'd we go this way?
- Because my phone told me to.

37:24.843 --> 37:28.211
- Jesus, look at that!

37:28.213 --> 37:30.847
- Bennett?
- What?

37:30.849 --> 37:34.017
- That's the manhattan medical
examiner. That's the guy right

37:34.019 --> 37:36.853
There who disappeared along with
the bodies of the passengers.

37:36.855 --> 37:40.123
That's him, right there.
- He's just a crazy

37:40.125 --> 37:42.259
Homeless guy.
- (woman): Ah! My god!

37:42.261 --> 37:44.561
- (woman): Ah!
- Holy shit!

37:44.563 --> 37:46.563
- Leave it,
it's not our problem.

37:46.565 --> 37:49.132
- You kidding me?
- Leave it!

37:49.134 --> 37:52.435
- (woman): Ah! Ah!
- Hey!

37:52.437 --> 37:54.537
- Damn new york city...
- No. No! No! No!

37:54.539 --> 37:58.208
Wait! Wait! Stop!
- Federal agent! Stop!

37:58.210 --> 38:00.277
- Ah! Ah!
- Hey! Hey! Hey!

38:00.279 --> 38:03.680
Stop! I said stop!

38:10.588 --> 38:12.822
- Fbi. Freeze!

38:16.927 --> 38:19.329
(woman screaming)

38:28.773 --> 38:32.175
- Help... Please...
(breathing haggardly)

38:32.177 --> 38:34.277
- Give me your keys.
Give me your keys!

38:34.279 --> 38:37.681
- Help me.
(keys jingling)

38:50.127 --> 38:54.564
- I warned you I'm sorry.

38:59.770 --> 39:03.440
- Yo matty, you missing the big
show in the sky.

39:03.442 --> 39:06.810
You ok, man?
- Yeah, yeah.

39:06.812 --> 39:09.946
I... Just got into a fight
with my girlfriend.

39:09.948 --> 39:11.981
Just trying to find a way
to make it right.

39:11.983 --> 39:13.983
- Ah, don't text her man.
It's impermanent. Look I know

39:13.985 --> 39:16.052
A guy who could sleeve you up
a real apology, though.

39:16.054 --> 39:19.289
- I was thinking more along the
lines of flowers, but thanks.

39:19.291 --> 39:22.459
- Alright.
- (man): Ah! Agh!

39:22.461 --> 39:25.161
- Jeff, what happened?!

39:25.163 --> 39:28.798
Call security,
get a first aid kit. Go! Go!

39:28.800 --> 39:31.568
Hey! Hey! Hey! Everything--
help is on the way, ok buddy?

39:31.570 --> 39:34.471
Who-- who did this?
Who did this?

39:37.842 --> 39:40.877
- (radio): <i>Many reports of</i>
<i>gruesome attacks occurring</i>

39:40.879 --> 39:44.214
- Hey! Did you do this?!

39:44.216 --> 39:46.750
(growling)

39:48.686 --> 39:51.888
(honk! Honk! Honk!)
(sirens)

39:57.828 --> 40:01.264
- What was in the bag, homie?
- Shut up, bro. Let me think.

40:01.266 --> 40:04.334
- We should've burned it gusto.
Need a priest.

40:04.336 --> 40:06.536
Coulda washed my hands
in holy water.

40:06.538 --> 40:08.938
- How many times I gotta tell
you - let it go, felix.

40:08.940 --> 40:11.341
- That dude who picked us up...

40:11.343 --> 40:14.744
He was scared...
And so were you.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.547
And that german dude?
We met a <i>diablo</i> today, <i>esse--</i>

40:17.549 --> 40:19.582
- Man, I told you. Shut up!

40:19.584 --> 40:22.085
I wasn't scared,
you were scared.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.921
(screaming in panic)

40:24.923 --> 40:29.426
(growling)
hey yo, be easy man. Relax.

40:32.563 --> 40:35.465
- Back up, man. Back up, <i>puto.</i>

40:35.467 --> 40:38.668
Gusto! Help! Help!

40:44.775 --> 40:46.609
Ah!

40:46.611 --> 40:49.746
What is it? Gusto, help!

40:49.748 --> 40:51.948
- What is it?
- Get it off!

40:51.950 --> 40:55.218
- What is that shit, bro?
Get it out!

40:55.220 --> 40:57.420
- Agh!

40:57.422 --> 40:59.889

40:59.891 --> 41:02.625

41:02.627 --> 41:09.032
- Here we go. Stop resisting!
- Ha! Ha! Ha! Now you show up.

41:24.482 --> 41:26.883
(bang! Bang! Bang!)

41:42.099 --> 41:44.334
- I'm ready to talk.

41:44.336 --> 41:46.703
- Follow me.

42:25.976 --> 42:29.612
- You're here.

42:34.418 --> 42:36.886
- You're both ready. Good.

42:39.657 --> 42:42.659
I have a new plan.
