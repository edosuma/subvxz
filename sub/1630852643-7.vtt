WEBVTT

00:25.275 --> 00:27.194
Dance your cares away

00:27.277 --> 00:29.363
Worry's for another day

00:29.446 --> 00:31.448
Let the music play

00:31.532 --> 00:33.367
Down at Fraggle Rock

00:33.450 --> 00:35.661
Work your cares away

00:35.744 --> 00:37.704
Dancing's for another day

00:37.788 --> 00:39.331
Let the Fraggles play

00:39.414 --> 00:40.374
-We're Gobo.
-Mokey.

00:40.457 --> 00:41.291
-Wembley.
-Boober.

00:41.375 --> 00:43.043
Red!

00:45.712 --> 00:47.172
Junior!

00:47.256 --> 00:48.590
Hello!

00:50.175 --> 00:51.301
My radish.

00:52.427 --> 00:54.388
Dance your cares away

00:54.471 --> 00:56.515
Worry's for another day

00:56.598 --> 00:58.600
Let the music play

00:58.684 --> 01:02.271
Down at Fraggle Rock
Down at Fraggle Rock

01:02.688 --> 01:04.105
Down at Fraggle Rock.

01:15.367 --> 01:17.619
The Troubadours are here.

01:17.703 --> 01:19.037
It's the Troubadours.

01:19.121 --> 01:20.414
It must be New Day's Day.

01:20.497 --> 01:23.208
-It must be New Day's Day.
-Yes. Yep, yep. Yes.

01:23.917 --> 01:25.460
Mr. Jamdolin.

01:25.544 --> 01:29.715
Is it true, Mr. Jamdolin?
Is it really New Day's Day?

01:29.798 --> 01:32.509
It's New Day's Day, little one.

01:32.593 --> 01:34.678
It's time to have some fun.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.221
Get it, two times.

01:36.722 --> 01:38.432
So brothers. Sisters!

01:38.807 --> 01:40.434
Inbetwixters. Hit it!

01:40.642 --> 01:42.477
Let's have some fun.

01:43.145 --> 01:46.440
What is this? Why is this?

01:46.523 --> 01:50.068
Can't an unfrozen explorer get some rest?

01:50.152 --> 01:52.571
New Day's Day's the best holiday.

01:52.654 --> 01:54.656
You're gonna love it, Icy Joe.

01:54.740 --> 01:57.326
It happens
when the flutterflies are ready to hatch.

01:57.409 --> 01:59.161
The Troubadours come to town.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.412
All right!

02:00.495 --> 02:03.248
They bring a special box
filled with flutterfly cocoons.

02:03.332 --> 02:06.043
-That's right.
-And we have a huge party.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.669
All night!

02:07.753 --> 02:10.672
-Yeah. It's awesome.
-It's the most fun.

02:10.756 --> 02:12.007
It's absurd.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.050
Wha--

02:14.092 --> 02:15.802
What? It's not for me.

02:15.886 --> 02:21.433
So, it's a holiday devoted to hope
and new beginnings.

02:21.517 --> 02:25.812
Yes. See, Icy Joe gets how ridiculous
the whole thing is.

02:25.896 --> 02:26.980
I love it!

02:28.357 --> 02:30.484
Icy Joe is all about new beginnings.

02:30.567 --> 02:35.489
I was frozen and mean,
but now I'm thawed and super nice.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.492
New Day's Day just isn't my thing.

02:38.575 --> 02:41.245
I'll be spending the holiday
elbow-deep in laundry.

02:41.328 --> 02:43.539
Thank you so much.

02:43.622 --> 02:44.831
Boober.

02:44.915 --> 02:46.041
Excuse me.

02:46.625 --> 02:48.460
So, now what?

02:48.544 --> 02:53.215
Okay, my Fraggle puppies,
it's time for the Skitter Scatter.

02:55.384 --> 02:57.469
The Skitter Scatter's a game.

02:57.553 --> 02:59.221
We all chase a rock,

02:59.304 --> 03:03.183
and whoever catches it
gets to release the flutterflies.

03:03.267 --> 03:06.603
I want to release the flutterflies.

03:06.687 --> 03:11.108
I want it. It's who I am.
It's what I want.

03:11.191 --> 03:13.277
It's what we all want.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.197
Before you release the flutterflies,
you get to give a speech.

03:17.281 --> 03:19.408
I love speeches.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.868
I hate speeches.

03:20.951 --> 03:23.996
I have to give a huge presentation
in front of all my professors.

03:24.079 --> 03:27.207
And if it doesn't go well,
my entire academic career is ruined.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.084
No biggie.

03:29.668 --> 03:30.460
Hey.

03:30.544 --> 03:33.297
Instead of laughing,
how about you make yourself useful

03:33.380 --> 03:35.716
and let me practice
my presentation for you?

03:35.799 --> 03:39.303
All PhD candidates are competing
for lab space, which I'm going to need

03:39.386 --> 03:42.890
if I'm ever going to discover
the bacteria that can eat microplastics.

03:43.807 --> 03:45.392
Wha-- Where are you g--

03:48.312 --> 03:51.607
Dressing like my professors
to make the practice seem real.

03:53.358 --> 03:54.735
I appreciate that.

03:54.818 --> 03:59.239
I don't know what the Liberty crown
has to do with it, but just-- You do you.

04:00.449 --> 04:03.785
H2-- Oh!
I didn't see you there.

04:03.869 --> 04:06.705
My name is Spaghetti.
Nope. That is not a name. My name is Doc.

04:06.788 --> 04:09.750
Actually, that's not my name,
that's a nickname I call myself.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.211
Be embarrassing if I said that
in front of all of you.

04:12.294 --> 04:16.882
So, professies…
my goal is to find and replicate

04:16.964 --> 04:21.136
a bacteria
capable of degrading microplastics.

04:21.220 --> 04:22.429
Okay. One second.

04:22.513 --> 04:25.057
I got this. It's gonna be fine.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.308
No, no.

04:28.143 --> 04:29.394
Okay.

04:29.478 --> 04:33.273
Dear Diary-- I mean, teachers.
I mean, thank you for coming.

04:33.357 --> 04:35.817
I love you. Did I just say "I love you"?

04:35.901 --> 04:38.278
No. I have to go. It's time.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.781
Okay.
Maybe got the bad stuff out, right?

04:40.864 --> 04:43.992
Bad dress rehearsal, great show.
It's gonna be fine.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.827
Wish me luck.

04:49.540 --> 04:51.875
Yeah.
That skittish stone's mine this year.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.335
-Really?
-Yeah--

04:53.418 --> 04:54.920
So, if I get the rock,

04:55.003 --> 04:58.382
I get to give a toast
and let the flutterflies loose?

04:58.465 --> 05:00.300
-And you get a hat.
-Yeah.

05:00.384 --> 05:02.094
-My friend and I love hats.
-Yeah.

05:03.679 --> 05:04.763
Anyway, Icy Joe,

05:04.847 --> 05:09.059
keep your eye on me
if you wanna learn a thing or two.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.769
Yeah, Red is good.

05:10.853 --> 05:12.062
But…

05:12.145 --> 05:13.814
I think this is my year.

05:14.982 --> 05:16.149
Gobo.

05:16.817 --> 05:17.901
Gobo.

05:17.985 --> 05:20.821
Come on, Boober.
You can't miss the Skitter Scatter.

05:20.904 --> 05:22.906
I hear you. But quick question.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.157
Why?

05:24.241 --> 05:28.203
I-- I couldn't catch that stone,
even if I wanted to, which I don't.

05:28.704 --> 05:30.914
These are laundry hands.

05:30.998 --> 05:34.334
Well, some say the stone finds you.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.713
It definitely does.

05:37.796 --> 05:39.840
Thing's got a mind of its own.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.925
Come on,

05:42.009 --> 05:44.720
I'm not saying anything
you wouldn't say yourself.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.141
Well, while the stone "finds" somebody…

05:49.224 --> 05:52.853
…I'm gonna find myself
a full day of laundry to do.

05:52.936 --> 05:54.438
But--

05:56.523 --> 05:57.733
-Should be fun.
-I hope so.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.276
I'm worried about Boober.

05:59.359 --> 06:03.822
He's so down on the holiday. Honestly,
I don't know if I'm gonna have any fun--

06:03.906 --> 06:05.532
-Are we ready?
-Yeah!

06:05.616 --> 06:07.784
Yes!

06:07.868 --> 06:11.079
I have a question about a pressing matter.

06:11.163 --> 06:14.333
When I say "skitter," what you gonna do?

06:14.416 --> 06:16.168
Scatter!

06:16.251 --> 06:19.880
Let's go!

06:19.963 --> 06:21.673
Over there! Oh, boy!

06:21.757 --> 06:23.800
Which way? Which way?

06:23.884 --> 06:26.845
Choose me. Choose me!

06:36.647 --> 06:39.024
Do you see it? Where'd it go?

06:49.785 --> 06:53.163
-Don't let it get away! Come on! Come on!
-I'm gonna get it first!

06:53.247 --> 06:56.375
-I'm gonna get it first!
-No. I got, I got it, I got it!

06:56.959 --> 06:57.960
In what way?

06:58.043 --> 07:02.840
In what way could I have abandoned
my laundry to do the Skitter Scatter?

07:02.923 --> 07:05.175
I have scarves in here.

07:05.759 --> 07:07.719
Scarves. Multiple.

07:11.265 --> 07:15.561
Boober, the stone chose you!

07:16.395 --> 07:18.981
Remind me to get that hole fixed.

07:23.235 --> 07:24.111
Boober.

07:24.194 --> 07:26.822
Is this a magical moment or what?

07:26.905 --> 07:29.867
I guess I choose "what".

07:29.950 --> 07:32.578
Come on. It'll be fun and easy.

07:32.661 --> 07:34.913
You do a little toast, open the box…

07:34.997 --> 07:37.708
…the flutterflies fly out,
then it turns into a party,

07:37.791 --> 07:40.711
and everyone dances hard.
Like really hard.

07:40.794 --> 07:43.338
The kind of dancing
where you become the music.

07:43.422 --> 07:44.840
Mokey, trust me.

07:45.549 --> 07:46.633
I'll mess it up.

07:47.301 --> 07:51.263
Boober, you tell yourself
these negative stories.

07:51.346 --> 07:55.642
Here, let's try rewriting this one
in a positive way together.

07:55.726 --> 07:58.395
Tell me what you think is gonna happen.

07:59.104 --> 08:00.230
Well…

08:00.314 --> 08:03.442
if I had to narrow it down…

08:06.236 --> 08:09.865
…I'll be so nervous,
I'll trip and fall on my nose.

08:10.866 --> 08:14.286
And then everybody's going to laugh at me
and my bent schnoz.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.038
Schnoz!

08:16.121 --> 08:18.624
Or they're laughing with joy.

08:18.707 --> 08:20.626
Because you fell on a tuft…

08:20.709 --> 08:22.794
…of quick-grow flowers.

08:22.878 --> 08:24.171
That was great.

08:24.254 --> 08:26.840
I love it when things work out.

08:26.924 --> 08:29.885
And now it's an uplifting story.

08:30.135 --> 08:31.512
See what I did there?

08:31.595 --> 08:33.931
Uplifting.
Like how the flowers lifted you back up.

08:34.014 --> 08:37.476
Yep. I got it. I got it.
But it's not an uplifting story.

08:37.558 --> 08:40.979
It's a terrible one
because quick-grow flowers make me itch.

08:42.147 --> 08:45.442
But that starts a new dance craze.

08:45.526 --> 08:47.361
This is the dance of my generation.

08:47.444 --> 08:50.113
I love you, Boober.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.865
And then we all get radishakes.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.077
When did you get here?

08:55.160 --> 08:58.413
I heard you guys doing stories,
and I wanted in.

08:59.081 --> 09:01.750
Okay, fine. Radishakes. I like those.

09:01.834 --> 09:04.002
-Yeah.
-See, there's the positive.

09:04.086 --> 09:05.671
You didn't let me finish.

09:05.754 --> 09:08.215
I like them so much
that I'll drink mine too fast,

09:08.298 --> 09:09.550
and I'll get hiccups.

09:10.968 --> 09:12.803
I'll get the full-body hicks,

09:12.886 --> 09:15.639
which means I won't be able to open
the flutterfly box.

09:15.722 --> 09:18.892
New Day's Day will be ruined
and become Boober's Day.

09:18.976 --> 09:21.186
The day Boober ruined everything.

09:21.270 --> 09:24.273
Why'd you ruin everything, Boober?

09:24.356 --> 09:26.400
You're the worst.

09:26.483 --> 09:29.987
Ever!

09:30.070 --> 09:33.323
None of that is going to happen.

09:33.407 --> 09:36.326
-You don't know that.
-No. You don't know that!

09:36.410 --> 09:39.246
It's not always the worst-case scenario!

09:42.541 --> 09:44.710
See, now I just want radishakes.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.924
Hey, hey. No peeking. Go on.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.429
New Day's Day! New Day's Day!

09:55.512 --> 09:57.389
New Day's Day!

09:57.472 --> 10:01.310
Hey, flutter bud bud.
Getting all juiced for your big toast?

10:01.393 --> 10:05.814
I just want all this flutterfly,
New Day's Day stuff to stop.

10:05.898 --> 10:08.066
Hey there, glummy bear.

10:08.150 --> 10:09.401
Life's like a river.

10:09.484 --> 10:14.031
It may be full of twists and turns,
but it just keeps flowing.

10:14.114 --> 10:17.409
Don't fight the flow. Just go, you know?

10:18.827 --> 10:19.661
No.

10:19.745 --> 10:22.164
Well, let me put it another way.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.416
Two, three, four.

10:34.927 --> 10:36.803
When every dream you had

10:36.887 --> 10:38.764
Has gone from good to bad

10:38.847 --> 10:40.599
Get a move on

10:40.682 --> 10:41.975
Go with the flow

10:42.059 --> 10:45.562
When every road you choose
Gives the loser's blues

10:45.646 --> 10:47.147
Get a move on

10:48.065 --> 10:49.107
Go with the flow

10:49.191 --> 10:51.026
Well, then you try all day

10:51.109 --> 10:52.528
You try all night

10:53.111 --> 10:56.532
You try until you drop
And still it don't come right

10:56.615 --> 10:57.950
If you're gonna grow

10:58.033 --> 11:02.120
You know you gotta
Go with the flow

11:03.205 --> 11:07.125
When the dark comes down
The night is all around

11:07.209 --> 11:08.460
Get a move on

11:09.127 --> 11:10.337
Go with the flow

11:10.420 --> 11:13.799
You know you can't pretend
You're looking straight at the end

11:13.882 --> 11:17.219
Get a move on
Go with the flow

11:17.302 --> 11:21.098
Well, when you're deep in fear
Up to here

11:21.181 --> 11:25.018
The end of everything
Is in the atmosphere

11:25.102 --> 11:26.228
If you're gonna grow

11:26.311 --> 11:30.566
You know you gotta
Go with the flow

11:32.401 --> 11:34.945
Get a move on, get a move on
Go with the flow

11:35.988 --> 11:38.532
Get a move on, get a move on
Go with the flow

11:38.615 --> 11:41.869
-Talk to 'em now
-Get a move on, get a move on

11:41.952 --> 11:44.246
And when the world won't work

11:44.329 --> 11:45.831
You're feeling like a jerk

11:45.914 --> 11:49.042
Get a move on
Go with the flow

11:49.126 --> 11:51.295
And when it's down the tubes

11:51.378 --> 11:52.880
You're feeling like a boob

11:52.963 --> 11:56.175
Get a move on
Go with the flow

11:56.258 --> 11:58.385
When everything's goodbye

11:58.468 --> 12:00.220
You're ready to die

12:00.304 --> 12:03.473
You wouldn't give a nickel
For a apple pie

12:03.557 --> 12:05.517
-If you're gonna grow
-Grow! Grow! Grow!

12:05.601 --> 12:09.062
You know you gotta
Go with the flow

12:10.981 --> 12:13.400
Get a move on, get a move on
Go with the flow

12:13.483 --> 12:16.111
-Say it again now
-Get a move on, get a move on

12:16.195 --> 12:18.071
-Go with the flow
-Talk to 'em now

12:18.155 --> 12:20.741
Get a move on, get a move on
Go with the flow

12:20.824 --> 12:22.659
That's right
That's right

12:22.743 --> 12:23.577
That's right

12:30.459 --> 12:33.962
-So, how you feeling now, bud?
-Good. I know what I have to do.

12:34.046 --> 12:34.963
good.

12:36.340 --> 12:38.926
Is there anything songs can't do?

12:39.676 --> 12:44.264
Gather round, freaky Fraggles.
The main event's about to waggle.

12:44.348 --> 12:47.309
Boober will do a toast
to make us go "whee!"

12:47.392 --> 12:51.271
Then the flutterflies will go
flee-dee-dee-dee.

12:51.355 --> 12:54.107
Yeah. Hey. You excited, bud?

12:57.069 --> 12:58.779
Is he okay?

12:58.862 --> 13:00.572
-He just loves this holiday.
-Yeah.

13:00.656 --> 13:03.242
Hey, do you think Doozers have holidays?

13:03.325 --> 13:06.119
-I hope so. They work so hard.
-Yeah.

13:08.997 --> 13:11.583
We are having a good time. We are dancing.

13:11.667 --> 13:15.003
Work the dance floor.
Work, work the dance floor.

13:15.087 --> 13:18.382
-Work. Work.
-Happy Helmet Appreciation Day!

13:20.759 --> 13:23.679
Happy Helmet Appreciation Day.

13:23.762 --> 13:26.431
Yas.

13:26.515 --> 13:28.725
-I guess we'll never know.
-Yeah.

13:28.809 --> 13:30.561
Hey, it's starting!

13:30.644 --> 13:33.730
Now presenting the Fraggle with the most.

13:33.814 --> 13:39.027
It's über, super Boober
with the New Day's Day toast.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.613
Yeah!
Come on, let's bring him out here.

13:41.697 --> 13:42.948
Boober's got this, right?

13:43.031 --> 13:44.825
Yeah. He'll rise to the occasion.

13:46.118 --> 13:47.119
Yeah!

13:51.331 --> 13:53.667
And he didn't show up to the occasion.

13:57.713 --> 13:58.672
Yeah.

13:58.755 --> 14:04.136
Like the song says, "Go with the flow."
And I'm flowing away from New Day's Day.

14:04.219 --> 14:05.345
Yeah.

14:05.429 --> 14:07.848
I don't know.
I just hope he comes soon, you know?

14:07.931 --> 14:09.349
-Me too.
-Yeah.

14:09.433 --> 14:11.226
So what now?

14:11.310 --> 14:13.729
Should one of us open the flutterfly box?

14:13.812 --> 14:15.480
I'll do it.

14:17.608 --> 14:19.234
Yes.

14:19.318 --> 14:20.819
Okay.

14:27.492 --> 14:30.787
Sorry, ice Fraggle.
The stone picked Boober.

14:30.871 --> 14:32.998
It's all right, buddy.
She didn't know.

14:33.707 --> 14:36.251
Flutterflies! Flutterflies!

14:37.085 --> 14:40.506
Boober's probably just running late.

14:40.589 --> 14:41.924
Don't worry. I'll stall.

14:42.007 --> 14:44.301
I'm an amazing storyteller.

14:46.678 --> 14:48.138
I don't have a story.

14:48.222 --> 14:49.640
Ran up before I had one.

14:49.723 --> 14:50.807
Be right back!

14:51.892 --> 14:53.852
Well…

14:53.936 --> 14:55.687
Hi, everyone.

14:55.771 --> 14:58.106
Well, how about
while we're waiting for Boober,

14:58.190 --> 15:00.734
I'll share the latest
from my Uncle Travelling Matt?

15:00.817 --> 15:02.778
-Yeah. Good idea.
-Yeah. Let's see.

15:04.196 --> 15:05.697
"Dear Fraggles…"

15:05.781 --> 15:07.908
It actually says, "Dear Nephew Gobo…"

15:07.991 --> 15:10.369
but, I adjusted on the fly.

15:12.079 --> 15:14.206
I, Yeah.

15:14.289 --> 15:17.209
It's hard being away from the Rock
on New Day's Day,

15:17.292 --> 15:19.127
the celebration of new life.

15:19.211 --> 15:21.421
I wanted to find
some version of that here,

15:21.505 --> 15:23.048
amongst the Silly Creatures,

15:23.131 --> 15:24.925
but things were at a standstill.

15:25.926 --> 15:28.387
Wake up! Life is for the living!

15:29.137 --> 15:31.765
I was feeling discouraged
until I saw it.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.101
New life in its purest form.

15:36.728 --> 15:39.606
Out of my way, sir.
I have new life to see.

15:39.690 --> 15:40.691
Helloo.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.320
Adorable.

15:46.280 --> 15:48.532
How do you create these bundles of joy?

15:52.160 --> 15:53.161
Yes.

15:58.959 --> 16:02.921
From the goop of nothingness
to birth and then to flight.

16:04.131 --> 16:06.008
It was all so beautiful…

16:06.758 --> 16:08.677
…and fragile.

16:10.137 --> 16:11.597
The cycle of life.

16:13.932 --> 16:16.351
I love bubbles!

16:18.020 --> 16:21.732
Yeah, he didn't even sign this one.
He got so excited.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.400
Okay, here we go.

16:23.483 --> 16:26.361
Get ready to be amazed.

16:30.991 --> 16:32.159
Pretty good, right?

16:33.160 --> 16:38.582
-Flutterflies! Flutterflies! Flutterflies!
-Oh, boy.

16:39.833 --> 16:41.543
What does it mean?

16:41.627 --> 16:44.922
-It's never done that before.
-Sounds like they're angry.

16:45.005 --> 16:48.425
Chill, babies, it's a holiday.

16:48.509 --> 16:50.886
Well,
maybe we could redo the Skitter Scatter

16:50.969 --> 16:54.890
and let someone else open the box.
Would that work, Jamdolin?

16:54.973 --> 16:57.601
Jamdolin? Wh-- Wh-- Where'd he go?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.811
Okay! Story time!

16:59.895 --> 17:01.980
So, I was--

17:02.064 --> 17:04.525
Still don't have one!

17:06.859 --> 17:09.988
Well, have you heard the one
about the dozing Doozer?

17:10.948 --> 17:12.115
Yep!

17:13.825 --> 17:15.827
No holidays, no hassle.

17:16.703 --> 17:19.289
I'm blissfully alone. Yeah.

17:23.292 --> 17:25.838
I just said I'm blissfully alone,

17:25.921 --> 17:26.839
so…

17:29.383 --> 17:31.510
Now, where was I?

17:33.303 --> 17:34.471
Great.

17:34.555 --> 17:36.473
I know. Hey, what's that…

17:36.557 --> 17:39.560
…over there?

17:39.643 --> 17:40.644
I've got it.

17:45.107 --> 17:46.942
How did you know it was me?

17:47.442 --> 17:49.152
Because she picked you.

17:50.946 --> 17:52.322
Why me?

17:52.406 --> 17:55.367
I don't even-- Like this holiday.

17:55.450 --> 17:58.495
The holiday is about hope
for new days ahead.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.788
What's wrong with that?

17:59.872 --> 18:02.875
Well, I don't like blindly hoping
good things will happen.

18:02.958 --> 18:06.545
I like to think through everything
that could possibly go wrong

18:06.628 --> 18:08.672
so I'm ready for anything.

18:08.755 --> 18:11.508
And that's-- That's how I feel safe.

18:11.592 --> 18:12.885
I hear you, hat guy.

18:12.968 --> 18:14.011
Boober.

18:14.094 --> 18:15.387
Hat guy…

18:15.470 --> 18:18.182
…did you anticipate
having this conversation with me?

18:18.265 --> 18:19.474
Well, I don't know.

18:19.558 --> 18:20.767
How about me?

18:20.851 --> 18:26.148
Yeah, she can talk.
I mean, usually just to me, but--

18:26.231 --> 18:29.318
But hat guy's bringing
some frustrated voice out of me today,

18:29.401 --> 18:30.652
-for real!
-For real!

18:30.736 --> 18:32.696
-For real!
-For real!

18:33.280 --> 18:35.782
-There's nothing wrong with who you are.
-Yeah.

18:35.866 --> 18:39.870
You can worry, fear, fret,
but just also be honest

18:39.953 --> 18:42.581
that you don't know everything
that's going to happen.

18:43.665 --> 18:45.918
And that includes some good things.

18:46.001 --> 18:49.004
So, you came here to tell me that?

18:49.087 --> 18:53.383
Yeah. And you're the only one
who can open the flutterfly box,

18:53.467 --> 18:57.346
and it's getting ready to explode.
Might be a mess for you and your friends.

18:57.429 --> 19:00.682
-What? We gotta go! We gotta go!
-Let's rock! Let's roll!

19:01.475 --> 19:05.145
No. There's gotta be a way
to get those flutterflies to fly.

19:05.229 --> 19:07.314
Everybody try a toast!

19:07.397 --> 19:08.732
-Okay. Okay.
-Yeah.

19:08.815 --> 19:09.983
Hi.

19:10.067 --> 19:12.819
I-I-I saw a bird once,
and it looked at me,

19:12.903 --> 19:15.239
and I was like,
"Do I control the birds now?"

19:15.322 --> 19:17.449
Happy New Day's Day!

19:18.951 --> 19:20.285
-Nothing. Okay, Red?

19:20.369 --> 19:23.747
-Come on, come on.
-My name's Red.

19:24.957 --> 19:27.292
That's not a toast. That's a fact.

19:27.376 --> 19:28.710
Let's face it.

19:28.794 --> 19:30.170
We need Boober…

19:30.254 --> 19:32.172
…and there's no way he's gonna come.

19:32.256 --> 19:34.174
Well, that may not be the case.

19:34.258 --> 19:35.175
Boober!

19:36.301 --> 19:37.928
I was thinking.

19:38.011 --> 19:39.763
And it's that…

19:41.723 --> 19:44.685
Well, it's that…
unexpected things can happen.

19:45.435 --> 19:49.231
Maybe hope just means being okay
not knowing what will happen

19:49.982 --> 19:51.066
because life is…

19:52.442 --> 19:53.569
…unpredictable.

19:54.570 --> 19:57.364
But it's also amazing.

19:57.447 --> 20:00.826
A-And maybe I can just try and enjoy it
as it unfolds around me

20:00.909 --> 20:02.494
and the Fraggles that I love.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.415
Happy New Day's Day.

20:08.208 --> 20:11.253
Happy New Day's Day.

20:18.385 --> 20:19.553
There they are.

20:19.636 --> 20:22.264
Yeah. Nice job, bud.

20:22.347 --> 20:23.807
All right!

20:23.891 --> 20:27.269
Let's put some royal jelly
on these sweet licks!

20:31.315 --> 20:35.027
I can feel a fresh start in the air

20:35.110 --> 20:38.697
I can tell that this will be our year

20:38.780 --> 20:41.700
Everybody's smiling ear to ear

20:41.783 --> 20:43.327
Ear to ear
Ear to ear

20:43.410 --> 20:45.037
Ear to ear! Yeah!

20:46.079 --> 20:49.541
All I feel is hope down deep inside

20:49.625 --> 20:53.128
'Cause every day gets better over time

20:53.212 --> 20:56.465
It just feels so good to be alive

20:56.548 --> 20:58.300
So good
So good

20:58.383 --> 20:59.801
So good!

21:00.427 --> 21:03.388
Today is New Day's Day

21:04.097 --> 21:07.226
It's time to celebrate

21:07.809 --> 21:10.646
It's hard to replicate

21:10.729 --> 21:13.106
And it's only getting
Brighter and lighter

21:13.190 --> 21:14.441
It's New Day's Day

21:15.484 --> 21:19.112
And I don't feel the weight there
On my back

21:19.196 --> 21:23.033
With every step I take
A smoother path

21:23.116 --> 21:26.203
And I hope this feeling
Lasts and lasts

21:26.286 --> 21:27.996
And lasts
And lasts

21:28.080 --> 21:29.122
And lasts

21:30.499 --> 21:33.377
Sometimes it's the things
That you can't see

21:33.877 --> 21:37.506
That live inside your heart eternally

21:37.589 --> 21:40.759
And something about this day
Feels good to me

21:40.843 --> 21:42.719
So good
So good

21:42.803 --> 21:43.804
So good!

21:44.304 --> 21:47.266
Today is New Day's Day

21:47.349 --> 21:48.350
Yeah!

21:48.433 --> 21:51.353
It's time to celebrate

21:52.145 --> 21:54.857
It's hard to replicate

21:54.940 --> 21:56.733
When it's only getting brighter

21:56.817 --> 21:58.527
It's only getting lighter

21:58.610 --> 22:01.613
The energy gets higher and higher

22:01.697 --> 22:03.156
It's New Day's Day

22:08.745 --> 22:09.746
Boober.

22:09.830 --> 22:12.791
How did you get rid of your fear enough
to do that?

22:12.875 --> 22:14.251
I-I didn't.

22:14.334 --> 22:16.336
My fear was with me the whole time.

22:16.420 --> 22:21.383
It's, It's a part of me.
I just didn't let it be everything.

22:23.343 --> 22:28.473
That's the best, most hopeful
New Day's Day toast I ever heard.

22:28.557 --> 22:29.766
It was?

22:29.850 --> 22:32.644
Well,
remind me when I forget I did that.

22:32.728 --> 22:34.146
-Okay?
-I promise.

22:34.229 --> 22:35.230
Okay.

22:35.314 --> 22:36.565
I promise too.

22:38.025 --> 22:41.195
Sorry. You two were having a moment.

22:41.278 --> 22:43.280
-Well.
-Well.

22:43.363 --> 22:45.240
I see that now.

22:45.324 --> 22:47.534
Carry on. That was awkward.

22:49.286 --> 22:50.704
-Wow!
-Wembley!

22:51.914 --> 22:53.874
Happy New Day's Day!

22:54.583 --> 22:56.251
So beautiful.

22:58.295 --> 23:01.173
-Happy New Day's Day to us all!
-Yeah.

23:01.256 --> 23:04.760
And to all, a New Day's Day!

23:34.957 --> 23:36.375
What?

23:39.753 --> 23:41.755
Look at that.

23:50.180 --> 23:51.640
That's right, Sprocket!

23:51.723 --> 23:53.183
My presentation went…

23:54.351 --> 23:55.811
…terribly.

23:56.228 --> 23:58.522
But I'm happy because, look,

23:58.605 --> 24:02.192
the worst case did happen,
and I'm still here.

24:02.276 --> 24:04.903
Sure, they denied my lab space request…

24:04.987 --> 24:07.614
…but setbacks are a huge part of science,

24:07.698 --> 24:11.451
and… …that was a setback.
At one point,

24:11.535 --> 24:14.872
I put my grandma on speakerphone
and introduced her to everyone.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.419
But it's not the end.
This is the beginning.

24:20.502 --> 24:23.005
Because you know
when big discoveries are made?

24:23.088 --> 24:25.591
When you suit back up and keep going.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.260
And if I can get through
an embarrassment like that,

24:28.343 --> 24:30.012
I can do anything.

24:30.095 --> 24:31.638
This calls for a celebration.

24:32.181 --> 24:35.350
Sprocket, may I have this dance?

24:44.484 --> 24:47.196
Tomorrow is a new day, Sprocket!

24:48.864 --> 24:50.699
And I can't wait!
