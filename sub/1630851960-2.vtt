[Clinton on TV]
Today the bickering stops,

00:08.508 --> 00:10.468
the era of excuses is over,

00:10.552 --> 00:12.387
the law-abiding citizens of our country

00:12.470 --> 00:14.097
have made their voices heard.

00:15.098 --> 00:16.182
Never again

00:16.808 --> 00:19.185
should Washington put politics and party

00:19.644 --> 00:20.812
above law and order.

00:22.230 --> 00:23.606
From this day forward,

00:24.733 --> 00:26.735
let us put partisanship behind us,

00:27.527 --> 00:28.570
and let us go forward--

00:28.653 --> 00:32.949
Democrats, Republicans and independents,
law enforcement, community leaders...

00:33.033 --> 00:33.867
Erik.

00:34.325 --> 00:35.952
[in Spanish] I never want to see you here!

00:36.244 --> 00:37.454
OK? Do you hear me?

00:37.537 --> 00:38.872
[Clinton on TV]
...to roll back this awful...

00:38.955 --> 00:40.498
I'm not doing this with my grandson.

00:40.707 --> 00:42.751
...and reduce crime in our country.
We have the tools now.

of using them.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.840
[gentle guitar music playing]

00:56.139 --> 00:59.017
One of the reasons
that I sought this office

00:59.893 --> 01:01.061
is to get this

01:01.144 --> 01:01.978
Let's go!

01:02.771 --> 01:07.734
...because if the American people
do not feel safe on their streets...

01:07.817 --> 01:10.904
I ran on a very simple slogan:

01:11.029 --> 01:12.906
Make America Great Again.

01:14.365 --> 01:16.785
If you're going to have drugs
pouring across the border,

01:17.368 --> 01:20.705
if you're going to have
human traffickers pouring across

01:21.247 --> 01:23.541
the border in areas
where we have no protection,

01:24.250 --> 01:26.086
in areas where we don't have a barrier,

01:27.295 --> 01:28.129
then...

01:28.213 --> 01:29.464
[buzz, door opens]

01:29.547 --> 01:32.050
it is very hard
to make America great again.

01:32.592 --> 01:36.304
But we've done a fantastic job.
But we haven't been given

01:36.387 --> 01:39.057

01:47.315 --> 01:48.525
You broke a window, Pop?

01:49.317 --> 01:52.362
-Only protesters and 13-year olds do that.
-Mm-hm.

01:52.487 --> 01:55.615
Yes, well, maybe it's because
I'm trying to make a point.

01:56.449 --> 01:57.575
Funny guy.

01:57.784 --> 01:59.953
Well, your point's gonna cost
us four grand, Abuelo.

02:00.954 --> 02:02.831
So unless you got it--a stack of cash

02:02.914 --> 02:05.125
in the chicken coop somewhere, I don't
know where we're gonna get this money.

02:05.208 --> 02:07.752
[in Spanish] No, no, no, the chickens
would tear it up for their nests.

He will lend us the money.

What are you talking about?

02:18.179 --> 02:19.472
Chris can't even pay rent.

02:19.889 --> 02:22.100
What, you think he has a 4K stacked away

02:22.183 --> 02:24.185

or some shit?

02:24.644 --> 02:25.770

to one of those bail bonds.

02:32.152 --> 02:33.236
And you know why.

02:33.319 --> 02:34.571
It's better than owing Chris.

02:35.238 --> 02:36.447
He'll charge us interest and fucking...

02:37.115 --> 02:39.701

02:39.993 --> 02:41.452

08:52.114 --> 08:53.908
[in Spanish]
I can't with this little fucker.

08:54.075 --> 08:56.202
Hey fools, if you got any jobs,

08:56.285 --> 08:58.454
paying ones, slide into the DMs.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.706
Pero nothing pervy, OK?

09:00.790 --> 09:01.624
Don't fuck around!

09:01.916 --> 09:02.750
[bleeps]

09:02.833 --> 09:03.876
Hey, cutie.

09:03.960 --> 09:06.379
-What's up?
-Oh my god, what are you doing here?

09:07.588 --> 09:08.589
[Ana] Ah...

09:08.965 --> 09:10.216
He's president of her fan club.

09:10.841 --> 09:11.842
-Sure, why not?
-[scoffs]

09:12.009 --> 09:16.931
Listen, one of my clients is
friends with Ernesto Yerena. You know him?

09:17.014 --> 09:18.933
-The artist?
-Yeah, for sure, that guy's the shit.

09:19.016 --> 09:20.101
Mm-hm.

09:20.351 --> 09:21.894
Well, he's looking for an apprentice.

09:22.478 --> 09:23.354
Paid.

09:23.604 --> 09:26.023
And I pulled in a favor for him
to come down here and meet you today.

09:26.107 --> 09:27.316
-What?
-Uh-huh.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.819
Babe, oh my god, you're everything!

09:29.902 --> 09:30.820
[smooches]

09:30.903 --> 09:33.197
Uh... Yes, tell him
to roll through whenever!

09:33.656 --> 09:35.491
-Yes! Mmm! [laughs]
-[laughs]

09:35.616 --> 09:36.951
OK, he can roll through,

09:37.034 --> 09:39.161
but after you paint me, like,
a big ass J-Lo right here.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.580
[clicks tongue] Girl, you paying.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.748
-[Connie] With pupusas! Aye!
-[scoffs]

09:42.873 --> 09:46.752
Pick up the pace, guys.
Got my nuts in a vice, here.

09:49.589 --> 09:50.965
Replate this, Felix.

09:51.132 --> 09:51.966
[slams]

09:52.383 --> 09:53.217
[sighs]

09:53.301 --> 09:55.636
[in Spanish] I need a beer to squash
the urge to punch him in the face.

09:55.886 --> 09:57.096
[laughs]

09:57.513 --> 09:58.764
Right, I know.

09:59.015 --> 10:00.266
It's crazy. What's going on?

10:02.768 --> 10:05.146
[in Spanish] We're gonna go get some beers
after work, huh?

10:05.688 --> 10:06.814
Oh, right on. Where you going?

10:07.440 --> 10:08.357
[Felix, grunts]

10:08.441 --> 10:09.775
We're going to a Mexican bar.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.068
Mexicans only.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.154
Sorry, bro.

10:13.487 --> 10:15.448
Well, yeah, but isn't he Venezuelan?

10:15.698 --> 10:17.575
Yeah, but in LA, we're all Mexicans, guey.

10:17.658 --> 10:18.492
A huevo!

10:18.576 --> 10:19.785
[both laugh]

10:19.869 --> 10:21.621
-You know, that's fine.
-[cell phone rings]

10:23.497 --> 10:24.373
-Yo.
-[Erik from phone] Hey.

10:24.540 --> 10:25.374
Pop's in jail.

10:25.666 --> 10:26.626
Hilarious. What do you want?

10:26.709 --> 10:29.170
-No, I'm serious, he needs bail money.
-Oh, my God.

10:29.337 --> 10:30.921
OK, I'll leave right now!

10:31.172 --> 10:33.257
If you leave now that idiot
will have a bitch fit.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.467
Two.

10:34.675 --> 10:37.303
I want to come down,
but my chef is on one today.

10:37.386 --> 10:38.846
Hold up, hold up, hold up, I'm sorry.

10:39.597 --> 10:42.266
I thought I just heard you say
you want to leave Pops in jail

10:42.350 --> 10:44.226
-so you can make rice?
-Can you just come down

10:44.310 --> 10:46.062
and get the debit card? Or I can--

10:46.145 --> 10:48.022
-I can pay online.
-Oh yeah, sure, there's

10:48.105 --> 10:49.815
Venmo, PayPal, Google Wallet--

10:49.899 --> 10:51.692
motherfucker, will you just
get your ass down here?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.862
[overlapping Spanish chatter]

10:55.863 --> 10:57.573
-Just come get the card.
-[busy phone signal]

10:57.698 --> 10:59.575
-Hello? Hello?
-[siren blaring in distance]

11:01.285 --> 11:02.286
Motherfucker.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.497
I fucking love Ana, man.

11:04.705 --> 11:05.706
Is she still gay?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.166
Or not?

11:07.917 --> 11:09.085
Where's this bail bonds?

11:09.460 --> 11:11.128
I feel like we walked
to Bakersfield already.

11:11.212 --> 11:13.839
I don't understand why don't you
just hit up your sugar mama?

11:13.923 --> 11:16.133
-Bitch, I don't got no sugar mama.
-Come on, man.

11:16.801 --> 11:18.594
-First name Lidia, last--
-Finish that sentence

11:18.678 --> 11:19.553
and I swear I'm gonna knock you out.

11:19.637 --> 11:20.471
Damn bro,

11:20.554 --> 11:21.472
you need a sound bath.

11:21.972 --> 11:25.101
But your hostility makes sense though,
your granddaddy,

11:25.184 --> 11:27.645
that fool who raised your ass
is now in jail.

11:27.853 --> 11:29.313
But now you're gonna be a daddy,

11:29.522 --> 11:30.773
but you need bail money

11:30.940 --> 11:31.982
for your granddaddy

11:32.191 --> 11:33.818
so you can make it to the ultrasound

11:33.984 --> 11:35.653
so you can be a good dad now.

11:36.278 --> 11:37.446
Shakespearean, bro.

11:39.490 --> 11:40.700
Motherfucker, just call Sarita already.

11:41.450 --> 11:42.993
[indistinct yelling]

11:44.328 --> 11:45.329
Hello, mamacita,

11:45.454 --> 11:47.206

11:47.289 --> 11:48.457
[woman on phone]
You're lost again, aren't you?

11:48.541 --> 11:49.583
Yeah, I'm lost again, babe.

11:50.251 --> 11:51.460
So you gonna hook up my boy or what?

11:51.544 --> 11:52.545
Does he have any collateral?

11:53.546 --> 11:55.214
She's gonna need
some collateral money, fool.

11:55.715 --> 11:57.425
-401K, a car note.
-My kidney,

11:57.508 --> 11:58.551
my fucking first born.

11:58.634 --> 11:59.802
I don't got any of that shit.

11:59.885 --> 12:01.095
No collateral, no money.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.471
She said, "No collateral, no money."

12:02.555 --> 12:04.056
I thought you said you had a hookup.

12:04.473 --> 12:05.307
[phone dings]

12:09.520 --> 12:10.354
[phone whoops]

12:11.814 --> 12:14.066

-Oh, I love telenovelas!

12:14.150 --> 12:15.651
-It's his girl.
-[phone whoops]

12:16.444 --> 12:18.988
No, their love is nothing like ours.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.740
She don't even want him.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.158
Can we get back to the collateral thing?

12:22.241 --> 12:23.784
-I got a truck.
-[Dave] He got a truck.

12:24.535 --> 12:25.369
Yeah.

12:25.870 --> 12:26.996
That busted ass truck,

12:27.079 --> 12:28.622
the one you saw me last time. The one...

12:28.914 --> 12:31.208
You gotta hold that door
when you make a left and shit.

12:31.333 --> 12:33.335
[speaking indistinctly over the phone]

12:34.420 --> 12:35.254
OK.

12:36.088 --> 12:36.922
She said no.

12:37.673 --> 12:39.008
Sorry bro, no deal.

12:39.091 --> 12:40.134
[phone beeps]

12:40.551 --> 12:41.635
There's always Lidia, homie.

12:41.927 --> 12:42.762
No.

12:43.637 --> 12:44.472
I got this.

12:50.895 --> 12:51.729
[Erik] Hey.

What's your superpower?
Eating platano at the speed of light?

12:58.360 --> 12:59.195
What?

12:59.278 --> 13:00.863
-Can I talk to you for a sec?
-[inhales]

13:04.867 --> 13:06.118
-Listen.
-Mm-hm.

13:06.619 --> 13:07.620
I need to borrow 4K.

13:07.703 --> 13:09.330
[chuckling] Oh yeah! Cool, cool, yeah.

13:09.413 --> 13:10.414
Let me just hit up my leprechaun,

13:10.498 --> 13:11.957
-he slings over on Soto.
-I'm serious.

13:12.041 --> 13:13.250
Does anybody owe you any money?

13:13.334 --> 13:14.585
Does your mom have any savings?

13:14.668 --> 13:16.086
Erik, hello?

13:16.170 --> 13:17.338
It's me, Ana!

13:17.546 --> 13:18.798
Your brokeass cousin.

13:19.256 --> 13:20.591
What's this for? Are you OK?

13:21.592 --> 13:23.594
-Alright, don't freak out, OK?
-Mm-hmm.

13:25.179 --> 13:26.806
-Pop's in jail.
-What?

13:26.889 --> 13:29.183
What for? Driving while Mexican?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.352
I told him to stop
blasting those Rancheras.

13:31.435 --> 13:32.812
-Everything cool?
-Everything's fine.

13:32.978 --> 13:34.396
-No, Pop's in jail.
-What?

13:34.480 --> 13:35.523
Is he OK?

13:35.940 --> 13:37.191
Was he playing Lucha Villa again?

13:37.274 --> 13:39.276
I told him not to do that.

13:39.360 --> 13:40.569
I pulled you aside for a reason.

13:40.653 --> 13:42.112
Pop doesn't want anyone
knowing his business.

13:42.196 --> 13:43.280
We're all family here.

13:44.406 --> 13:45.574
-Chuy!
-[phone whoops]

13:45.699 --> 13:47.201
Do not tell anyone, OK?

13:47.576 --> 13:48.410
[in Spanish] Of course not!

13:49.078 --> 13:49.912
Only Javier.

13:50.079 --> 13:50.913
And Norma.

13:50.996 --> 13:53.624
And Panchito because he's also
in the Facebook group.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.210
-At least tell us what he did.
-Fine.

13:57.545 --> 13:58.963
He got drunk and busted some windows.

13:59.046 --> 14:01.131
What? What is he, 13?

14:01.841 --> 14:02.716
Bail's four grand,

14:02.800 --> 14:04.176
-and I only have a few hundred.
-[sighs]

14:05.010 --> 14:06.136
-OK, what do we do?
-It's OK, baby,

14:06.220 --> 14:07.555
don't worry. I know some non-profits--

14:07.638 --> 14:10.266
Oh, perfect, I'm sure he won't mind
waiting six months to get out.

14:10.391 --> 14:11.684
At least I'm providing solutions.

14:11.767 --> 14:14.103
-What are you running with? Platano jokes?
-Babe, babe, babe, he's right.

14:14.603 --> 14:16.438
I don't want Pop to be in there
one more night.

14:16.897 --> 14:17.731
Did you try Chris?

14:17.815 --> 14:19.400
I called him this morning,
but he won't leave work, he--

14:19.483 --> 14:21.277
You've known since this morning
and you're barely telling me!

14:21.360 --> 14:22.653
-Hey, hey, hey! Relax, relax, relax!
-Pop didn't want you to know.

14:22.736 --> 14:23.571
[Chuey] Con permiso.

14:24.530 --> 14:25.656
I can lend you some money.

14:28.200 --> 14:29.869
I just need a little collateral.

14:53.267 --> 14:55.311

blew out the speaker.

14:56.145 --> 14:57.354
What about Ernesto?

we're just gonna get to Chris
and then I'll be right back.

15:02.109 --> 15:03.068
No. We're not using that fool.

15:03.527 --> 15:04.862
Oh. Oh, I'm sorry,

15:04.987 --> 15:07.156
I'm sorry. Are we gonna pay
Pop's bill with bong water?

Mm.

Please, love, please, I promise.

Don't worry, dog.

We brought the Grey Poupon as requested.

15:30.846 --> 15:32.473
Hey chulito, Chavo del Ocho.

15:32.932 --> 15:34.892
Remember, we're asking Chris
to do us a solid, here.

-Come on.
-Chale.

take so long, man, I was worried.

-Yeah.
-Hold on, let me get the money.

to work for Chef Austin, alright?

16:10.761 --> 16:13.263

Pop got all intimate with Jose Cuervo.
