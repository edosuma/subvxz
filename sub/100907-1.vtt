WEBVTT

00:48.465 --> 00:50.258
So, last night was fun.

00:50.341 --> 00:52.552
-It was really fun.
-I had a really good time.

00:54.637 --> 00:56.556
Well, good-bye for real.

00:57.140 --> 00:58.141
Yeah.

00:59.392 --> 01:00.810
-I'm starving.
-I could go for some breakfast.

01:01.269 --> 01:02.604
Do you wanna go get
something to eat?

01:03.146 --> 01:04.272
Definitely.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.191
-I'll just get my jacket.
-Yeah.

01:11.529 --> 01:12.530
Mmm.

01:15.700 --> 01:18.453
I did. I hung out with
the crudites table all night,

01:18.536 --> 01:19.913
trying to work up
the courage
to talk to you

01:19.996 --> 01:21.372
because I knew
you'd be back.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.666
I kept going back
to the crudite table,

01:23.750 --> 01:25.210
trying to get you
to notice me.

01:25.627 --> 01:27.962
I noticed you the moment
you walked in the door.

01:28.588 --> 01:29.422
What's your last name?

01:30.131 --> 01:31.674
Why? So you can
Google-stalk me?

01:31.758 --> 01:35.094
No, I just wanna know
what to put in my phone.

01:35.303 --> 01:38.515
Oh. I'm not giving you
my phone number.

01:47.982 --> 01:49.108
You've made a huge mistake.

01:49.192 --> 01:51.319
I knew it.
I felt it in my gut.

02:03.206 --> 02:05.250
-Oh, shit.
-What?

02:05.333 --> 02:07.710
I forgot that I made plans
with my friends today.

02:07.919 --> 02:09.212
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
go to your friends.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.380
It's not a big deal.

02:11.214 --> 02:12.257
Unless you want.
I could stay.

02:12.465 --> 02:13.800
-This was fun.
-Oh.

02:14.217 --> 02:15.343
-I should go.
-Do you wanna stay?

02:15.426 --> 02:16.678
Oh... Okay.

02:23.268 --> 02:24.477
What is that?

02:25.478 --> 02:27.272
-What?
-That face.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.524
Is that your
"I wanna kiss you" face?

02:29.732 --> 02:31.192
-No.
-Oh.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.236
Oh. Wait. Unless...

02:34.112 --> 02:34.946
Unless what?

02:35.113 --> 02:37.282
What does your
"I wanna kiss you" face
look like?

02:37.657 --> 02:39.576
It looks a lot like this.

02:54.007 --> 02:55.925
You are unbelievable.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.476
<i> You are</i>
<i>literally unbelievable!</i>

03:05.560 --> 03:06.436
If I told someone,

03:06.519 --> 03:07.687
"This is what Leilani
said to me," they'd be like,

03:07.770 --> 03:09.022
-"I don't believe you."
-Who are you?

03:09.105 --> 03:10.732
-You're not even upset!
-Why would I be upset?

03:10.815 --> 03:12.150
Because it's fucked up.

03:12.233 --> 03:14.777
Don't do this.
Don't make this
a whole global thing--

03:14.861 --> 03:16.905
-I'm upset.
-I thought you were kidding.

03:17.030 --> 03:19.115
Why would I possibly
be kidding about
something like this?

03:19.198 --> 03:20.199
Oh, my God!

03:20.450 --> 03:21.701
Okay, he's up now.

03:21.951 --> 03:23.578
You think we would win
<i>The Amazing Race!</i>

03:23.745 --> 03:26.164
-You don't?
-You think, in a game show

03:26.247 --> 03:28.166
about a race
around the fucking world,

03:28.249 --> 03:30.126
you and me
would come out on top.

03:30.209 --> 03:32.003
I did,
but now I'm not so sure.

03:32.086 --> 03:33.630
We can't even agree
on a restaurant.

03:33.838 --> 03:35.715
We can't agree on a restaurant
because you have a problem

03:35.798 --> 03:37.759
with every restaurant
in New Orleans.

03:37.842 --> 03:40.094
The restaurant capital
of the world,
and you can't decide.

03:40.303 --> 03:42.639
Actually, Hong Kong is
the restaurant capital
of the world.

03:44.390 --> 03:46.851
I just don't want you
to embarrass yourself
in front of your friends

03:46.935 --> 03:49.020
by getting these
pretty basic facts wrong.

03:49.103 --> 03:51.648
I don't hate restaurants.
I like restaurants.

03:51.731 --> 03:54.734
You literally spent
several hours yesterday
writing a negative Yelp review

03:54.817 --> 03:56.236
with your white-woman fingers

03:56.402 --> 03:58.154
about that tapas place
we went to,

03:58.238 --> 03:59.280
and I thought
it was pretty tasty.

03:59.364 --> 04:00.657
It was very salty.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.409
I didn't know I would get
mouth-fucked by the Dead Sea!.

04:03.493 --> 04:05.536
And I don't have
white-woman fingers.

04:05.620 --> 04:06.871
I've got meaty bronze.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.790
Why are you being
so loud right now? Okay?

04:08.873 --> 04:10.333
Do you want the neighbors
to think we're crazy?

04:10.416 --> 04:12.335
Who cares
what the neighbors think?
They don't know us.

04:12.418 --> 04:15.046
Hi, nice to meet you!
We're fighting!

04:15.129 --> 04:17.340
No, we're not!
We're rehearsing a play!

04:17.507 --> 04:18.675
It's a fight scene.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.218
How's this?

04:21.427 --> 04:22.428
It's fun.

04:22.512 --> 04:24.055
It's fun?
What do I look like,
Chuck E. Cheese?

04:24.222 --> 04:26.724
But sexy.
You're like Fuck E. Cheese.

04:29.185 --> 04:32.313
By the way, you know
you can't have your cell phone
on those shows, right?

04:32.397 --> 04:33.564
You'd lose your mind.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.025
No, I wouldn't.
I'd be liberated
without that thing.

04:39.279 --> 04:40.655
-I'm good.
-You wanna get that?

04:40.738 --> 04:42.615
<i>♪ Nope, I'm good! ♪</i>

04:42.782 --> 04:45.034
Oh, my God,
what if somebody liked
something on Instagram?

04:46.953 --> 04:48.037
- Tsk.

04:48.121 --> 04:49.163
Shut up. You don't know me.

04:49.706 --> 04:51.624
It's Val.
She said I look thicc.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.585
Mmm-hmm. Another reason
we wouldn't win that show,

04:54.752 --> 04:58.339
you can't take selfies
when you're half naked,
eating ants off a stick.

04:58.423 --> 04:59.757
Do you even watch the show?

05:01.426 --> 05:03.094
Have I seen <i>The Amazing Race?</i>

05:03.177 --> 05:04.929
This is literally the question
you're asking me right now?

05:05.138 --> 05:06.222
That's what I'm asking you.

05:06.306 --> 05:08.975
You're asking me, Jibran,
have I seen <i>The Amazing Race?</i>

05:10.310 --> 05:11.144
Uh-huh.

05:11.227 --> 05:13.563
You've spent
this entire time
judging this show

05:13.646 --> 05:14.647
and you've never seen
an episode?

05:14.731 --> 05:16.816
I don't need to see something
to know I would hate it, okay?

05:16.899 --> 05:18.651
I've never been
hit by a truck,
but I know it would suck!

05:18.735 --> 05:20.445
-Wow!
-I don't wanna rot my brain

05:20.528 --> 05:22.155
watching that
reality show garbage.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.449
You make documentaries, okay?

05:24.532 --> 05:26.701
Those are just reality shows
that no one watches.

05:26.784 --> 05:28.119
Documentaries are not
reality shows.

05:28.202 --> 05:29.787
Documentaries are reality.

05:30.204 --> 05:32.540
Okay? My work
is social activism.

05:32.623 --> 05:33.708
I don't do it for the RTs.

05:34.417 --> 05:35.668
You don't
have to say RTs.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.003
Just say retweets, Dad.

05:37.086 --> 05:38.338
Can we please go?

05:38.588 --> 05:40.631
The later we are,
the longer we'll have to stay.

05:40.715 --> 05:43.092
What's the rush?
It's not like we're doing
anything exciting afterward.

05:43.301 --> 05:44.802
I thought we were
gonna have sex.

05:45.094 --> 05:47.096
Oh, yeah,
'cause nothing gets me hotter

05:47.180 --> 05:49.891
than a plan in the day to have
sex at night. Whoo, freaky!

05:49.974 --> 05:52.018
You want freaky sex?
We could do freaky sex.

05:52.101 --> 05:53.519
Just let me know
what you want me to do

05:53.603 --> 05:55.688
and I will do it to you
at the designated time.

05:55.772 --> 05:58.274
That is the antithesis
of freaky sex! Okay?

05:58.524 --> 06:00.318
Just schedule me
in your calendar.

06:00.401 --> 06:02.779
"Intercourse with Leilani
at 10:42."

06:02.945 --> 06:04.030
-Super sexy.
-Okay.

06:04.113 --> 06:07.075
Freaky sex and scheduling are
not mutually exclusive, okay?

06:07.158 --> 06:10.078
You think people
just randomly show up
at the same time for an orgy?

06:10.161 --> 06:11.788
No, they probably share
a Google Calendar.

06:11.871 --> 06:13.289
No, I think
it's spontaneous.

06:13.372 --> 06:15.124
One guy comes,
and another guy comes.

06:15.291 --> 06:17.376
They show up
and they have sex.

06:17.460 --> 06:20.004
It's a bunch of guys there,
why wouldn't you have sex
with them all?

06:21.255 --> 06:23.549
Okay, there's a lot
to parse through there,

06:24.008 --> 06:26.844
but you're talking
about a gang bang,
I'm talking about an orgy.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.012
Tomato, tomahto.

06:28.096 --> 06:30.306
And where are you getting
your group sex information?

06:30.389 --> 06:31.808
-BuzzFeed?
- I don't know!

06:41.943 --> 06:44.695
So, who's gonna be
at this dinner-party thing?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.989
Um, Bobby and Reya.

06:48.491 --> 06:49.617
Val...

06:50.118 --> 06:53.079
I think maybe Keith, Stefan...

06:53.454 --> 06:54.997
-Um...
-Oh, you think maybe Keith?

06:56.082 --> 06:56.999
Yeah, maybe.

06:57.083 --> 06:58.918
As if you're not 100% sure
he's gonna be there?

06:59.127 --> 07:00.711
I'm not sure. I'm not.

07:00.795 --> 07:02.380
Oh, yeah? You wanna bet?

07:02.463 --> 07:05.007
I bet he's gonna be there
with his fucking lame jokes

07:05.091 --> 07:06.592
and his boring
IT stories and his...

07:07.385 --> 07:10.471
beach muscles he gets from
diligent exercise and diet.

07:10.555 --> 07:13.474
-Are you done?
-Hate to burst
the Keith bubble,

07:13.558 --> 07:16.227
but all those hilarious jokes
that he does?

07:16.727 --> 07:18.896
Katt Williams.
They're Katt Williams' jokes.

07:18.980 --> 07:20.773
You're saying that he steals
his jokes from Katt Williams?

07:20.857 --> 07:21.774
Exactly.

07:21.983 --> 07:25.403
"How do you know it's nice
to meet me? I'm an asshole!"

07:25.820 --> 07:27.238
That's Katt Williams,
word for word.

07:27.405 --> 07:28.781
That doesn't even sound
like Katt Williams.

07:28.865 --> 07:30.074
Well, I'm not gonna
use the voice.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.410
To win <i>The Amazing Race,</i>
you need to be a team,

07:32.493 --> 07:33.703
you need to be
on the same page.

07:33.870 --> 07:37.123
I feel like I'm on one page
of the book and you're,
like, reading a magazine.

07:37.206 --> 07:39.375
Yeah. I would love to be
on the same page as you,

07:39.459 --> 07:41.878
but you're always
locked in your office
editing that movie.

07:41.961 --> 07:43.129
It's not a movie.

07:43.212 --> 07:46.466
This is a documentary
about corruption
in the educational system.

07:46.549 --> 07:48.301
How would I know?
You won't even show it to me.

07:48.384 --> 07:50.052
-I'll show it to you
whenever you want.
-Been working on it forever.

07:50.136 --> 07:51.471
Okay, great.
How about tomorrow?

07:51.679 --> 07:54.265
I can't do it tomorrow.
I'm rendering the animation.

07:57.018 --> 07:58.686
Steph and George
are getting married?

07:59.103 --> 08:00.271
Did you just like that?

08:01.230 --> 08:02.231
Yeah.

08:04.609 --> 08:07.236
-What happened to
"marriage is bullshit"?
-It is.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.489
Okay. Well, then
why did you like it?

08:09.780 --> 08:11.949
Because I didn't wanna be
the only one out of our friends

08:12.033 --> 08:13.784
to not like it.
I'm not a hater.

08:13.868 --> 08:15.995
Okay. Since the day
we've met,

08:16.078 --> 08:18.623
you've talked about
how you think marriage
is fucking lame.

08:18.706 --> 08:20.708
I didn't say "lame."
I said "problematic."

08:20.791 --> 08:23.961
Right. Two people declaring
their eternal love
for each other.

08:24.045 --> 08:25.338
How problematic.

08:25.421 --> 08:27.715
You know what I think?
I think you do want
all that stuff.

08:27.798 --> 08:30.301
Marriage and kids.
You just don't
want it with me.

08:30.384 --> 08:33.221
And I think that you just want
someone with no expectations,

08:33.304 --> 08:36.015
so you can sit in that room
by yourself
for the rest of your life.

08:36.182 --> 08:37.558
I think you just want
a relationship

08:37.642 --> 08:38.976
that you can brag about
to your friends.

08:39.060 --> 08:41.229
Yeah, I do!
And I'm not willing to settle.

08:41.395 --> 08:42.480
I don't wanna settle, either.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.358
That's why I don't
wanna be with someone
who's so fucking shallow.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.362
And I don't wanna
be with someone

08:49.445 --> 08:51.697
who's so satisfied
with being a failure.

09:01.749 --> 09:03.876
-I can't do this anymore.
- This isn't working.

09:13.010 --> 09:14.095
Are we done?

09:14.262 --> 09:16.472
I think we've been done
for a while.

09:23.145 --> 09:25.064
- Oh, fuck!
- Shit!

09:25.523 --> 09:28.359
- Oh, fuck. Uh...
- Shit.

09:30.695 --> 09:32.863
-Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
- Uh...

09:32.947 --> 09:34.949
-Uh, are you okay?
- You okay?

09:35.533 --> 09:37.535
Oh, there's blood.
Here, let me help you up.

09:37.618 --> 09:39.161
No, no, you probably
shouldn't move him.

09:39.245 --> 09:40.371
Oh, right. Yeah.

09:40.538 --> 09:42.456
-I'm gonna call 911, okay?
-No, no, no!

09:42.540 --> 09:44.041
I'm fine. I gotta go.

09:44.125 --> 09:45.167
You're bleeding,
you're not fine.

09:45.251 --> 09:46.711
- Are you sure?
-I gotta go. I gotta go!

09:46.794 --> 09:48.212
Oh.

09:49.964 --> 09:52.550
Uh... I don't know
if that's a good idea, man.

09:53.092 --> 09:54.719
-Thank you.
-I'll call 911.

09:54.802 --> 09:57.471
Wait, wait, wait!
Wait! You forgot your phone!

09:58.723 --> 09:59.890
Oh, my God.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.484
-I need your car!
-What?

10:10.568 --> 10:12.236
I'm a police officer
and he's a criminal!

10:12.320 --> 10:13.904
Move the fuck over!
Get in the back!

10:14.030 --> 10:15.281
Move, move, move!

10:16.073 --> 10:16.949
Hold on.

10:20.953 --> 10:21.996
-Where'd he go?
-Huh?

10:22.163 --> 10:23.331
-Where'd he go?

10:23.998 --> 10:25.666
-He went that way!

10:25.875 --> 10:27.960
East! East!
Uh, suspect headed eastbound.

10:34.467 --> 10:35.801
What did he do? Was it drugs?

10:36.093 --> 10:37.511
It was drugs, huh?
Are you undercover?

10:37.595 --> 10:39.639
You can't tell us
if you're undercover, huh?
I get it.

10:39.847 --> 10:41.599
At least we didn't hit
a good guy, right?

10:41.682 --> 10:44.268
It's not good
that we hit someone,
but at least we hit a bad guy?

10:44.352 --> 10:46.520
Yeah, who rides a bike
in this part of town?

10:46.687 --> 10:48.105
Yeah, where do you think
you are, Europe?

10:51.984 --> 10:53.402
Sorry, we'll be serious.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.529
Right there! There he goes!

10:58.157 --> 10:59.700
Off the sidewalk, asshole!

11:05.956 --> 11:07.166
Turn, turn, turn!

11:07.541 --> 11:09.043
We got him. Yes!

11:11.128 --> 11:12.880
- Shit!

11:14.840 --> 11:16.425
Rats! Right?

11:16.509 --> 11:18.219
Wait, if you make a left
up here, you can cut him off.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.804
Oh, good idea. Oh!

11:21.138 --> 11:22.390
- Yep!
-Whoo.

11:25.643 --> 11:26.894
-There he is, over there!
-Oh! Oh!

11:28.854 --> 11:29.688
Oh.

11:30.064 --> 11:31.357
Fucking jaywalkers.

11:36.028 --> 11:38.489
Shit, he's going in circles!
What an idiot!

11:41.784 --> 11:43.494
- Turn! Turn!
- Turn!

11:44.662 --> 11:46.205
There, there, there!
Go, go, go!

11:46.288 --> 11:47.289
He turned the corner!

11:47.373 --> 11:49.083
Go down this alley,
it's a dead end!

11:49.708 --> 11:52.086
Ho, ho, ho! Justice!

12:00.469 --> 12:01.720
Oh, my God!

12:19.029 --> 12:20.114
Um...

12:22.575 --> 12:24.326
-Oh, oh...

12:30.791 --> 12:32.793
-Oh, my God.

12:46.891 --> 12:48.517
I don't think he's a cop.

13:14.835 --> 13:16.170
Oh, my God.

13:16.754 --> 13:18.005
Hello?

13:19.089 --> 13:20.299
I think
he's fucking dead.

13:21.383 --> 13:22.384
Oh, shit!

13:23.010 --> 13:25.179
- What the fuck?
-Oh, my God.

13:28.891 --> 13:31.060
Oh, my God, what did you do?

13:31.977 --> 13:34.605
-Oh. Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, oh-- No, no, no.

13:34.688 --> 13:35.689
This isn't what it looks like.

13:35.773 --> 13:36.774
We didn't kill him.

13:36.857 --> 13:38.359
You hit him
with your car, man.

13:38.442 --> 13:40.069
No! I mean, yes, I did, but--

13:40.152 --> 13:42.238
-No, that was-- That's all.
-That was a while ago.

13:42.321 --> 13:43.322
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:43.447 --> 13:46.659
After I hit him,
he was alive and, like, great.

13:46.742 --> 13:48.494
Not "great."
He wasn't having the best day,

13:48.577 --> 13:49.995
but he has been breathing
since then.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.247
He's fucking dead!

13:51.330 --> 13:53.457
We know he's dead,
but we didn't kill him.

13:53.541 --> 13:54.667
He just said he killed him.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.961
No. I said I hit him
with my car.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.755
-Clearly it worked. You killed
a guy with your car, man!
- Okay, but, no, wait.

13:59.838 --> 14:01.590
-We hit him earlier and then
we were just drivin' to...
- I was driving,

14:01.674 --> 14:03.384
-and we broke up,
and I got distracted...
-...Bobby and Reya's house.

14:03.467 --> 14:04.301
...and I ran through
a red light...

14:04.385 --> 14:05.219
-But a moustache came in...
- But then this guy

14:05.302 --> 14:06.637
with a weird moustache...
No, we hit him earlier.

14:06.720 --> 14:08.305
I helped him a little bit
with my map,

14:08.389 --> 14:09.807
which I admit
was definitely a mistake.

14:09.890 --> 14:11.642
He took our car,
he ran over him like a dog--

14:11.725 --> 14:12.893
We need to call the cops.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.979
And then back and forth
ten times

14:15.062 --> 14:16.605
and now I've
got a dead guy's blood on me

14:16.689 --> 14:18.107
and my car's
a fucking murder weapon!

14:18.190 --> 14:19.984
-What are you doing?
-I'm calling 911.

14:20.067 --> 14:21.402
Please don't do that.
We would never hurt anyone.

14:21.610 --> 14:23.279
I'd like to report
a murder or whatever.

14:23.362 --> 14:24.697
We didn't murder anybody!

14:24.947 --> 14:26.532
-Yeah, stop.
- You stop!

14:27.366 --> 14:28.993
Oh, my God, the police
aren't gonna believe us.

14:29.076 --> 14:30.661
Do you know
how stupid we sound?

14:30.911 --> 14:33.330
-This is a citizen's arrest.
-What is that?

14:33.414 --> 14:34.540
It's an arrest from a citizen.

14:34.623 --> 14:35.624
Can you do that?

14:36.041 --> 14:37.960
-Can he do that?
-On the count of three. Okay?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.044
On the count of three, what?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.129
What is that face?

14:40.296 --> 14:42.381
I can't read your face!
Just say it.

14:42.464 --> 14:43.465
On the count of three.

14:43.549 --> 14:45.175
-What? What?
-One, two, three, go!

14:45.259 --> 14:46.594
The guy just ran for it.

14:46.677 --> 14:47.678
Jibran!

14:47.761 --> 14:48.804
Okay, the guy's name
is Jibran.

14:49.305 --> 14:50.472
Run, Leilani!

14:50.556 --> 14:51.891
And the girl's name
is actually Leilani.

14:51.974 --> 14:53.267
Shit.

14:53.350 --> 14:55.102
She's--
She's running too now.

14:55.185 --> 14:57.104
She just happens to be
African-American

14:57.187 --> 14:59.356
and he just happens to be
a person of color as well.

14:59.440 --> 15:00.774
But I don't, like,
think they're murderers

15:00.858 --> 15:02.651
because they're minorities.
I think they're murderers

15:02.735 --> 15:04.278
because they
literally just killed a guy

15:04.361 --> 15:05.946
-and he's laying here.
-Oh, fuck.

15:17.458 --> 15:18.459
Hey.

15:20.127 --> 15:21.295
Are you okay?

15:23.631 --> 15:25.758
- Nosebleeds.
- It's house painting
with red paint.

15:25.841 --> 15:28.552
We were painting the kitchen
blood colors?

15:34.308 --> 15:35.601
What can I get for you guys?

15:35.726 --> 15:37.227
Do you have alcohol?

15:37.311 --> 15:39.647
-Two, please.
-Two.

15:39.730 --> 15:40.731
Two what?

15:40.814 --> 15:43.150
Two alcohols, please.
Thank you so much.

15:44.443 --> 15:45.945
We don't serve alcohol.

15:50.783 --> 15:52.368
We have to go to the police.

15:52.993 --> 15:54.078
Us?

15:55.287 --> 15:56.538
You and me?

15:56.956 --> 15:58.290
How do you think
that's gonna go?

15:58.374 --> 16:00.334
It's the best bad idea.

16:00.417 --> 16:03.128
No, it's not. They're gonna
arrest us in two seconds.

16:03.462 --> 16:05.005
Maybe we just tell them
the truth.

16:05.089 --> 16:06.465
Do you think the police
care about the truth?

16:06.548 --> 16:07.549
Do you think
they're gonna give us

16:07.633 --> 16:09.051
the benefit of the doubt?

16:09.259 --> 16:10.761
-But what else?
-Jibran,

16:10.844 --> 16:12.930
the truth sounds crazy.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.015
What are you gonna
say to them?

16:16.433 --> 16:17.434
"Hello, Officer.

16:18.018 --> 16:20.771
We are turning ourselves in
for now,

16:21.021 --> 16:23.190
because we have
nothing to hide."

16:23.273 --> 16:25.109
"Then why'd you run
from the scene of the crime?"

16:25.192 --> 16:26.402
"Good question, Officer.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.821
That's why
you're good at your job.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.907
It's because
we looked guilty.

16:31.991 --> 16:35.160
Which was scary for us,
because we are not guilty.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.746
So, in a way, us running
only proves that we are--"

16:37.830 --> 16:40.082
"That's me covering up
my bodycam,

16:40.165 --> 16:42.918
so I can beat
your ass, you fucking liar."

16:43.210 --> 16:45.671
-Okay. Okay. Done?
-Nope.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.758
That was me
throwing the book at you.

16:50.718 --> 16:52.720
You know there's no real
actual book, right?

16:52.803 --> 16:54.722
"So you left
a man dead in the street?"

16:54.805 --> 16:57.349
-"We did not leave him dead."
-"And didn't call the police?"

16:57.433 --> 16:59.476
"Because there was no time,
because we had to--"

16:59.643 --> 17:01.770
"Brown man, you sound crazy."

17:02.062 --> 17:03.689
-"Don't say that."
-"You look like
a murderer to me."

17:03.772 --> 17:05.566
-"Don't say that."
-"Look at your murderous beard

17:05.774 --> 17:07.359
and your murderous brow."

17:07.443 --> 17:08.819
You said you liked the beard.

17:08.902 --> 17:11.113
Your beard looks like murder.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.163
- Don't.
- Hello?

17:19.246 --> 17:20.789
Leilani, where the fuck
are you guys?

17:20.873 --> 17:23.375
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>
<i>We bumped into an old friend.</i>

17:23.959 --> 17:25.711
<i>-And...</i>
-Still at home.

17:25.794 --> 17:28.088
we were going back and
forth with him several times.

17:28.172 --> 17:29.173
Can you tell them
to grab some wine

17:29.256 --> 17:30.549
We don't have any white
for Evonne.

17:30.632 --> 17:33.552
Hey, can you pick up a bottle
of pinot? Grigio, not noir.

17:33.635 --> 17:35.220
Sure,
we'll bring a bottle over.

17:35.345 --> 17:36.847
Great. See you in a bit.

17:37.806 --> 17:41.060
-What's going on?
-They're acting weird.

17:41.643 --> 17:42.728
How you know
it's nice to meet me?

17:42.811 --> 17:44.730
-What if I'm an asshole?

17:45.105 --> 17:46.398
You're hilarious.

17:59.203 --> 18:00.662
This silver
milkshake container

18:00.746 --> 18:02.581
is such a thing, you know?

18:02.831 --> 18:04.166
They're always like,
"We made too much,

18:04.249 --> 18:05.709
so here's the extra
and the container

18:05.793 --> 18:06.794
that we made it in."

18:06.877 --> 18:08.587
They can't just
measure it out?

18:08.879 --> 18:10.589
Huh?

18:10.923 --> 18:12.966
They don't do that
with other stuff.

18:13.050 --> 18:14.885
They're not like,
"Well, here's spaghetti

18:14.968 --> 18:16.845
and here's some more
spaghetti on the side.

18:17.012 --> 18:19.223
We made too much
for the spaghetti plate.

18:19.681 --> 18:20.974
Here's soup.

18:21.058 --> 18:22.851
We didn't wanna
measure it out early on,

18:22.935 --> 18:24.269
and here we are."

18:24.353 --> 18:26.146
Like, what the fuck?

18:26.396 --> 18:28.607
-It's crazy.
-It's so crazy.

18:28.690 --> 18:31.944
Not the extra
milkshake container.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.372
<i>Is this Leilani Brooks?</i>

18:44.289 --> 18:45.374
Who is this?

18:45.457 --> 18:47.835
This is Detective Mary Martin
of the New Orleans PD.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.253
Hi, Detective.

18:49.336 --> 18:51.839
Ma'am, have you driven your
vehicle at any time today?

18:53.090 --> 18:55.843
No, not-not today. Mmm-mmm.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.177
Can I ask
where you are right now?

18:57.261 --> 18:58.595
She's asking
where I am right now.

18:58.679 --> 19:00.013
- Hang up.
-Home.

19:00.347 --> 19:02.266
I'm home. Just chilling.

19:02.349 --> 19:04.393
Are you saying that your
vehicle is at home as well?

19:04.685 --> 19:05.769
- Hang up.
-Yes!

19:06.812 --> 19:09.356
If I just go to my window
right now, I should see--

19:10.357 --> 19:11.483
Oh, my God.

19:12.067 --> 19:13.861
Honey, wasn't our car
parked outside?

19:13.944 --> 19:14.987
<i>This is crazy, Detective.</i>

19:15.070 --> 19:17.698
I must have left the keys
in the ignition.

19:17.948 --> 19:19.616
Can I get you two
anything else?

19:20.117 --> 19:21.285
<i>Is that a waitress?</i>

19:21.368 --> 19:23.287
<i>Ma'am, where are you right now?</i>

19:24.329 --> 19:25.455
We'll get the check.

19:27.958 --> 19:29.543
We're so fucked!

19:29.626 --> 19:30.961
No, we're not.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.297
We just have to lay low

19:33.839 --> 19:37.176
and keep a low profile
until this blows over.

19:37.259 --> 19:38.594
I don't think--

19:39.553 --> 19:41.471
Murders don't blow over, Lei.

19:41.555 --> 19:42.556
Yes, they do.

19:42.639 --> 19:45.225
If the police find the guy
that they're looking for.

19:45.309 --> 19:47.019
You and me are the guy
they're looking for.

19:47.102 --> 19:49.646
You know that song "Bad boys,
bad boys, whatcha gonna do"?

19:49.730 --> 19:52.191
We're the bad boys.
What are we gonna do?

19:52.316 --> 19:54.026
Yeah, I know that song
<i>Who Let the Dogs Out.</i>

19:54.526 --> 19:55.986
And I'm always like,
who did let the dogs out?

19:56.069 --> 19:57.863
Are we just talking
about songs that we remember?

19:58.030 --> 19:59.031
You started it.

20:01.033 --> 20:03.118
Bicycle guy's phone
bing-bonged.

20:03.202 --> 20:04.494
It just made
a bing-bong sound.

20:04.578 --> 20:06.747
Oh, don't touch it!
That's evidence!

20:06.830 --> 20:08.498
I've been touching it
the whole time.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.503
It's his calendar.
"Edie at Dragon's Den."

20:13.754 --> 20:15.422
Wait. This Edie person

20:15.505 --> 20:17.674
obviously knows Bicycle, right?

20:18.175 --> 20:21.845
-What?
-So what if she knows
who wanted to kill Bicycle?

20:22.387 --> 20:24.014
Oh. Okay, so you're suggesting

20:24.097 --> 20:26.350
we actually go out there
and solve a--

20:26.433 --> 20:28.310
murder?
That's what you're suggesting?

20:29.019 --> 20:30.270
Kinda.

20:30.354 --> 20:31.730
Who the fuck do you think
we are?

20:31.897 --> 20:32.856
Hobbs and Shaw?

20:32.940 --> 20:34.149
We're not even a couple.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.651
We couldn't figure out
our relationship.

20:35.734 --> 20:38.237
You think that we're gonna
figure out who killed Bicycle?

20:41.823 --> 20:43.200
We did break up, right?

20:45.285 --> 20:46.328
Yeah.

20:46.411 --> 20:47.621
Okay.

20:49.248 --> 20:50.749
Jibran, all we need is a name.

20:50.999 --> 20:52.334
We get Mustache's name,

20:52.417 --> 20:54.962
we take it to the police,
and then we're in the clear.

20:55.712 --> 20:57.130
We have ten minutes
to get there.

20:57.214 --> 20:59.800
I don't think
this is a good idea at all.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.678
I know you're scared, Ji,
and I'm scared, too.

21:02.928 --> 21:04.012
But...

21:06.473 --> 21:08.016
What a sweet baby.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.726
Woof-woof.

21:10.143 --> 21:13.272
Can we try Edie?
See if she can help us?

21:14.898 --> 21:16.149
Okay.

21:16.233 --> 21:17.359
But if you're wrong
and we spend

21:17.442 --> 21:18.819
the rest of our lives
on death row,

21:18.902 --> 21:19.945
I'm gonna be so pissed at you.

21:20.529 --> 21:21.738
That's fair.

21:25.325 --> 21:26.994
- Oh, my God.

21:27.077 --> 21:28.495
It's the police.

21:28.578 --> 21:31.039
-Don't answer it, ignore it.
-Right, right, right.

21:31.665 --> 21:33.083
Right, right.

21:34.501 --> 21:36.169
Why do they still have
the cigarette lighter?

21:36.253 --> 21:38.338
Like, just make it
a power outlet

21:38.422 --> 21:39.548
at this point, you know?

21:39.631 --> 21:41.383
Like, who's like,
"I'm operating a vehicle,

21:41.466 --> 21:42.968
I want to introduce fire
into this--"

21:43.051 --> 21:45.554
Jibran, please.
No more milkshake monologues,

21:45.637 --> 21:47.431
-okay?
-Right.

21:48.140 --> 21:50.017
Excuse me, sir,
this isn't our destination.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.939
-Are you Leon?
- Yes, sir.

21:56.148 --> 21:58.567
- Dope.

22:02.112 --> 22:03.488
You ordered a Lyft share.

22:03.864 --> 22:06.241
I just have it set
on that option by default.

22:08.201 --> 22:09.870
You're amazing.

22:10.537 --> 22:11.788
Oh, you're amazing.

22:11.872 --> 22:13.540
But you're like
amazing-amazing.

22:13.623 --> 22:14.708
No, you are.

22:14.791 --> 22:15.917
I miss you
when we're together.

22:16.626 --> 22:18.128
Like, right this second,

22:18.211 --> 22:20.797
I am sitting next to you
and I miss you.

22:21.423 --> 22:22.549
Aw, baby.

22:22.716 --> 22:25.052
So, we're gonna
go to this spot

22:25.135 --> 22:26.303
and find this Edie person

22:26.386 --> 22:29.181
-and then see what happens.

22:29.806 --> 22:31.975
How are we gonna know
who Edie is?

22:32.059 --> 22:35.270
I don't know, we just go up
to her and ask if--

22:36.897 --> 22:39.149
I love you
more than I love my mom!

22:39.316 --> 22:41.151
Shut the fuck up! Okay?

22:41.234 --> 22:42.319
It's all kissy and huggy now,

22:42.402 --> 22:44.529
but it all comes
crashing down.

22:45.030 --> 22:46.114
Okay?

22:50.994 --> 22:53.663
All right, here we go
into the Dragon's Den.

22:53.747 --> 22:55.415
It'll be fine.
We got this.

22:59.628 --> 23:00.837
It's not that bad.

23:01.254 --> 23:02.798
We just gotta find her.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.216
Okay. Yeah.

23:05.258 --> 23:07.594
We just act
super normal, okay?

23:08.178 --> 23:09.346
Yeah.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.349
We're normal.
Just normal people.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.352
Coming to a bar.

23:21.316 --> 23:22.818
We should not have come here.

23:22.901 --> 23:25.737
You say that anytime
we go anywhere with people.

23:25.821 --> 23:28.031
I was talking about
the sense of impending doom

23:28.115 --> 23:30.283
that's growing in the pit
of my stomach right now!

23:30.617 --> 23:32.744
I'm just saying.
If I never made plans,

23:32.828 --> 23:34.037
we would never go anywhere.

23:34.121 --> 23:36.706
Congratulations, you made
plans and this happened.

23:52.305 --> 23:53.515
Okay, act normal.

23:53.598 --> 23:55.142
- Love dancing.
- Whoo!

23:55.225 --> 23:56.560
Normal-people shit.

24:06.236 --> 24:07.445
That has to be her.

24:08.029 --> 24:09.114
Okay, what do we do?

24:10.657 --> 24:12.284
We should go
over there, right?

24:28.758 --> 24:29.759
Edie?

24:31.052 --> 24:32.137
Edie.

24:32.220 --> 24:33.930
- Edie?

24:34.431 --> 24:35.557
Stop talking.

24:36.308 --> 24:37.392
Come with me.

24:41.104 --> 24:43.356
Who are you? He sent you?

24:43.565 --> 24:44.774
Yeah. Um...

24:45.275 --> 24:47.194
Jibran, why don't you explain?

24:47.277 --> 24:50.238
Um... There's sort of not
a good starting point.

24:50.322 --> 24:52.574
He wants to be unprofessional
and send two strangers

24:52.657 --> 24:54.784
instead of coming himself,
that's fine.

24:54.868 --> 24:56.578
Let's just do this
and be done with it.

24:56.661 --> 24:58.246
We just had a question,
and we wanted to know

24:58.330 --> 24:59.331
if you know a guy
with a mustache?

24:59.414 --> 25:00.415
We don't know
what's going on.

25:00.498 --> 25:01.750
Know a guy
with a mustache?

25:01.833 --> 25:04.419
Okay, drop the act.
It's unbecoming.

25:04.502 --> 25:06.463
There's a way to do this
that's respectable.

25:10.967 --> 25:13.428
And this? This is not that.

25:23.063 --> 25:25.232
Hand 'em over
and this can all end.

25:25.440 --> 25:26.650
-What?
-Oh, no.

25:26.733 --> 25:29.069
The pictures.
Give me the envelope.

25:29.402 --> 25:30.737
-What pictures?
- Oh, no.

25:30.820 --> 25:32.489
You guys think
you're the only ones

25:32.572 --> 25:34.366
who can dig up a little dirt?

25:36.201 --> 25:37.661
I know who your boss is.

25:37.744 --> 25:39.537
We don't have a boss.
We don't work together.

25:39.621 --> 25:41.164
We don't know what pictures
you're talking about.

25:41.248 --> 25:43.833
I'm a documentary filmmaker,
she works at an ad agency.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.377
You remember that commercial
where the guy's a nerd

25:45.460 --> 25:46.670
and then he uses
this body wash

25:46.753 --> 25:48.380
and all the girls, like,
wanna fuck him?

25:48.463 --> 25:50.173
-That was her idea!
-That was my idea.

25:50.257 --> 25:51.258
It was based on a true story.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.801
This guy was really nerdy
at my college,

25:52.884 --> 25:54.135
and he would smell good
and then I was like,

25:54.219 --> 25:55.220
"I like him now."

25:55.303 --> 25:56.888
She didn't like the way
a guy looked at college,

25:56.972 --> 25:59.015
and then he smelled better
and then she fucked him!

25:59.099 --> 26:01.101
But it's fine,
and we don't know anything!

26:01.184 --> 26:02.602
Oh, yeah, right.

26:02.686 --> 26:04.396
You showed up
at the designated time

26:04.479 --> 26:05.605
and place of the exchange.

26:05.689 --> 26:06.898
Yeah, because
of this guy's phone

26:06.982 --> 26:07.983
and it bing-bonged your name!

26:08.066 --> 26:09.442
We were just trying to go
to our friend's dinner party.

26:09.526 --> 26:10.860
We have nothing
to do with anything.

26:10.944 --> 26:14.281
We just answered
a bing-bong!

26:15.615 --> 26:17.450
-Jibran. Mmm-mmm.
-Huh?

26:17.534 --> 26:19.619
-She's not buying it.
-Oh, okay.

26:19.703 --> 26:21.621
Let's take the guesswork
out here.

26:21.913 --> 26:24.916
You said that
this gentleman's not your boss

26:25.000 --> 26:26.501
-and you don't even know him?
-Uh-huh.

26:26.584 --> 26:29.879
Oh. Why don't we just call him
and see what he has to say?

26:29.963 --> 26:31.381
-Okay. Great.
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, call him.

26:31.464 --> 26:33.550
- Mmm-hmm.

26:37.387 --> 26:39.055
Oh, no.

26:39.723 --> 26:41.141
It's not what you think.

26:41.224 --> 26:43.435
Don't pee down my back
and tell me it's raining.

26:43.560 --> 26:45.312
-Why would we do that?
-We would never do that.

26:45.395 --> 26:47.647
If she pees down your back,
she's gonna say it's pee.

26:47.731 --> 26:49.399
You think you can
fuck with a congressman

26:49.482 --> 26:51.943
and get away with it?
You got another thing coming.

26:54.362 --> 26:56.364
-Oh, no!
-Oh! What the fuck?

26:58.033 --> 26:59.576
Did you just tell them
I'm a congressman?

27:00.493 --> 27:02.162
- I--
-Come here. Real quick.

27:04.080 --> 27:05.290
I'll be right back.

27:08.877 --> 27:10.295
What's happening?

27:10.378 --> 27:11.379
Can you get out?

27:11.463 --> 27:13.048
This is
fucking insane.

27:13.131 --> 27:14.466
Take that damn
mask off, Brett.

27:14.924 --> 27:16.217
Are you okay?

27:17.093 --> 27:18.678
Well, it still doesn't
seem like a good idea.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.013
My husband.

27:20.096 --> 27:22.557
He was just about to get me
my pan. Right, hon?

27:22.640 --> 27:23.516
I thought we agreed

27:23.600 --> 27:24.684
we weren't really
gonna do the pan.

27:24.768 --> 27:27.187
You go get me my goddamn pan!

27:27.604 --> 27:29.939
Hey, just to clarify, we're
not blackmailing anybody.

27:30.023 --> 27:31.316
Excuse me, what is "the pan"?

27:31.399 --> 27:34.861
You tried to fuck us.
Now you're gonna get fucked.

27:34.944 --> 27:36.446
Yeah, okay,
your premise is wrong

27:36.529 --> 27:37.697
because we didn't
try to fuck you.

27:37.781 --> 27:38.907
And we don't
wanna get fucked.

27:38.990 --> 27:40.909
- No.
- Mmm.

27:41.493 --> 27:43.912
I just love the smell

27:44.079 --> 27:46.373
of sizzling bacon, don't you?

27:47.165 --> 27:49.376
The only problem
is the grease!

27:49.501 --> 27:51.252
Y'all ever see
a bad grease burn?

27:51.836 --> 27:55.048
It is remarkable the damage
a little hot oil can do.

27:55.632 --> 27:57.842
I'm gonna give you both
a choice, okay?

27:58.385 --> 28:01.304
All the grease in this pan,

28:01.388 --> 28:04.349
or what's behind this door.

28:05.308 --> 28:06.976
-What?
- I said,

28:07.060 --> 28:08.895
bacon grease

28:08.978 --> 28:10.355
or door.

28:10.438 --> 28:11.648
It's up to you.

28:11.731 --> 28:14.275
And you're first,
Mr. Bing-Bong.

28:14.359 --> 28:15.568
Take the grease.

28:16.027 --> 28:18.613
Are you serious?
It's boiling hot grease.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.240
And she could pour the grease
on my face!

28:20.323 --> 28:22.075
Edie, may I ask a question?

28:22.158 --> 28:24.285
Do I get to know
prior to making my decision

28:24.369 --> 28:25.662
where you'll be pouring
the grease?

28:25.912 --> 28:28.706
Um, yeah, it'll probably
most definitely be your face.

28:28.790 --> 28:29.791
Thank you.

28:29.874 --> 28:31.584
She said probably my face.

28:31.668 --> 28:33.169
She's obviously
trying to scare you

28:33.253 --> 28:34.921
into choosing something worse.

28:35.004 --> 28:37.298
We're single now. I have to
go out into the dating world.

28:37.382 --> 28:38.842
How do you think
I'm gonna do on Bumble?

28:38.925 --> 28:40.135
Scars are super sexy.

28:40.218 --> 28:41.344
Oh, you like burn scars?

28:41.428 --> 28:43.596
After this, I'm gonna seek out
a guy with a burnt face.

28:43.680 --> 28:44.848
You promise?

28:44.931 --> 28:46.224
I'm gonna stalk
your Facebook so hard.

28:46.307 --> 28:47.767
And if you're not
with a fucking burn victim,

28:47.851 --> 28:49.519
I'm gonna be so very upset.

28:49.602 --> 28:50.812
Well, thanks for reminding me
to block you.

28:50.937 --> 28:52.230
I'm blocking you
right after this.

28:52.313 --> 28:53.356
Let's make a decision here,
all right?

28:53.440 --> 28:55.191
My husband and I
have plans tonight.

28:55.275 --> 28:58.027
I'll go with not the grease.
I'll go with the door.

28:58.194 --> 28:59.863
-Jibran!
-Door it is.

29:00.530 --> 29:01.406
Tell him what they've won.

29:01.489 --> 29:03.241
No, no, no, no!
Jibran, press your feet!

29:03.324 --> 29:04.492
I am!
I'm planting my feet!

29:04.576 --> 29:05.702
Stop it!
Leave him alone!

29:06.494 --> 29:07.996
- Open the door.
- Yep.

29:15.128 --> 29:16.755
Is it gonna shit on me?

29:25.138 --> 29:26.681
Take the grease.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.016
It's your turn,
little missy.

29:28.099 --> 29:29.559
The grease! The grease!
I take the grease!

29:29.809 --> 29:31.770
A lady who knows
what she wants.

29:32.604 --> 29:34.355
Ow!

29:35.273 --> 29:37.108
No, no, no! No, no, no!

29:40.195 --> 29:41.654
No, no, no, no, no!

29:41.821 --> 29:43.490
Okay, let's see--

29:48.745 --> 29:50.497
Come on, help,
help, help me, help!

29:50.997 --> 29:52.874
Oh, God.
Honey, are you all right?

29:52.957 --> 29:54.000
- No!

30:06.221 --> 30:07.889
Stay back! Stay back!
You stay back!

30:07.972 --> 30:09.098
-You ready?
-Yeah.

30:09.182 --> 30:11.017
One, two, three--

30:12.435 --> 30:13.978
Where are you going?

30:15.480 --> 30:17.357
- Whoa, honey!

30:34.040 --> 30:35.375
What the fuck
just happened?

30:35.458 --> 30:36.626
Dude, I said,
"One, two, three,"

30:36.709 --> 30:38.461
and you, like, ran.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.088
Yeah, 'cause that's
what you did in the alley.

30:40.171 --> 30:41.172
You kinda set a precedent.

30:41.256 --> 30:42.173
That's what
I was going off of.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.383
Yeah,
but I assumed you assumed

30:43.466 --> 30:46.177
this time it would be like,
"One, two, three, attack."

30:46.302 --> 30:47.720
Why would I assume that?

30:47.971 --> 30:50.098
Because we had
weapons? I don't know.

30:50.849 --> 30:53.351
I never want to see
a horse again in my life.

30:59.399 --> 31:00.400
Thank you.

31:08.575 --> 31:10.076
What, I look stupid?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.078
Kinda like unicorn throw-up?

31:12.161 --> 31:13.454
No, you look...

31:14.455 --> 31:15.665
the opposite.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.750
Unstupid.

31:23.548 --> 31:24.549
Are you okay?

31:25.633 --> 31:26.843
Yeah, I'm fine.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.638
It just hurts a lot right
where the horse kicked me.

31:33.182 --> 31:35.018
Uh... Come with me.

31:37.353 --> 31:38.605
It looks okay? Ow.

31:38.688 --> 31:39.689
-If you could--
-Sorry.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.317
stop tapping right where
the wound is.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.860
I'm just trying to help.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.069
Okay.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.696
Come on, let's do this.

31:46.779 --> 31:48.740
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

31:52.452 --> 31:53.536
I can't.

31:53.828 --> 31:55.788
I'm just gonna wear this shirt
for the rest of my life.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.749
No, you're not.
Stand up.

32:00.627 --> 32:02.462
Uh, raise your arms.

32:05.506 --> 32:07.675
Okay. One, two, three.

32:18.269 --> 32:19.270
Can I just say this is

32:19.354 --> 32:20.855
the most batshit crazy
night ever?

32:20.939 --> 32:22.440
You've never been
framed for murder

32:22.523 --> 32:23.566
and tortured
with bacon grease?

32:25.652 --> 32:26.694
Really?

32:26.778 --> 32:27.987
-It just--
-Really?

32:28.571 --> 32:30.990
-Just be so gentle. Just--
-Okay, I'm sorry.

32:32.575 --> 32:34.202
-I didn't even touch you.

32:47.548 --> 32:48.925
I ordered us a Lyft.

32:49.759 --> 32:51.719
I hope
you changed your settings.

33:03.064 --> 33:05.316
You probably
don't remember this, but,

33:06.567 --> 33:07.568
our first date,

33:08.319 --> 33:09.404
that restaurant,

33:09.779 --> 33:12.407
there was this couple
sitting next to us,

33:12.615 --> 33:13.825
and they didn't talk
the whole--

33:13.908 --> 33:15.118
I remember them.

33:15.618 --> 33:16.953
-You do?
-Yeah.

33:17.453 --> 33:19.747
They didn't say anything
to each other the entire time.

33:20.123 --> 33:22.041
You know, I think about them
all the time.

33:22.834 --> 33:24.127
'Cause I was looking at them

33:24.210 --> 33:25.920
like I never
want to be that couple,

33:26.004 --> 33:28.047
you know, that runs
out of stuff to talk about.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.549
But then the more
I think about them,

33:29.799 --> 33:31.009
the more I'm like...

33:32.468 --> 33:34.262
maybe they weren't miserable.

33:34.721 --> 33:36.139
You know?
Maybe they were just

33:36.973 --> 33:38.725
comfortable with each other.

33:45.398 --> 33:48.276
So my theory about Edie
obviously didn't pan out.

33:50.278 --> 33:51.237
Maybe you were right.

33:51.320 --> 33:53.156
Maybe we should
just go to the cops.

33:54.615 --> 33:56.117
I found something.

33:57.118 --> 33:58.119
What?

33:59.954 --> 34:02.248
The piece of paper that Edie
had with Bicycle's number?

34:02.498 --> 34:03.958
It has an address on it, too.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.418
What? When did you get this?

34:05.501 --> 34:07.462
I was thinking,
maybe Mustache killed Bicycle

34:07.545 --> 34:09.839
because of those pictures
that Edie was talking about.

34:10.048 --> 34:11.799
So if we can
find those pictures,

34:11.883 --> 34:12.884
figure out what they are,

34:12.967 --> 34:14.260
maybe we can
exonerate ourselves.

34:14.510 --> 34:16.554
Mustache was clearly
looking for something,

34:16.637 --> 34:18.681
and Edie was very upset
about those pictures.

34:18.765 --> 34:20.141
-It's a clue, right?
-Yeah!

34:20.224 --> 34:21.309
I did a clue.

34:24.562 --> 34:26.481
Should we go to that address?

34:27.440 --> 34:29.942
You know this is
actually illegal, right?

34:30.026 --> 34:32.028
Breaking into Bicycle's house?

34:32.779 --> 34:33.863
Are you sure?

34:34.989 --> 34:36.365
Are you?

34:36.574 --> 34:37.450
Yeah.

34:37.533 --> 34:39.994
- Oh, that's our guy.

34:46.000 --> 34:47.502
Oh, shit.

34:51.839 --> 34:52.840
Shit.

34:53.758 --> 34:55.468
He knows it's us,
he totally knows it's us.

34:55.551 --> 34:57.011
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.

34:57.095 --> 34:59.889
Shit, he's totally onto us.
He's onto us, he's onto us.

35:03.810 --> 35:05.144
Oh, he's just
a regular racist.

35:05.228 --> 35:07.021
-Thank God.
-Let's go.

35:21.285 --> 35:22.995
- Shit.

35:23.871 --> 35:26.165
-What?
-How are we gonna get up there?

35:26.249 --> 35:27.750
-What? You just--

35:28.793 --> 35:30.628
Did you think it was one
of those "Men Only" doors?

35:30.711 --> 35:31.712
Sorry.

35:33.131 --> 35:34.215
Maybe...

35:34.715 --> 35:35.883
Maybe there's
one of those, like,

35:35.967 --> 35:36.968
catwalk things
around the side--

35:37.051 --> 35:39.554
A "catwalk"? You mean
like for fashion shows?

35:39.887 --> 35:41.180
Do you mean a fire escape?

35:42.557 --> 35:43.975
Why are you making jokes
right now? This is serious.

35:44.058 --> 35:45.143
Okay. Okay.

35:45.977 --> 35:48.646
Yeah. Break the glass. You go.

35:48.729 --> 35:50.273
-Me go? I'm wearing heels.
-You're wearing heels.

35:50.356 --> 35:52.191
Right. The icepick part
will stab the glass--

35:52.275 --> 35:53.818
The "icepick part"?
Do you mean

35:54.277 --> 35:55.278
the heel?

35:55.361 --> 35:56.779
Yes, the pointy heel
part of the shoe

35:56.863 --> 35:58.573
will break the glass.
It'll go right through it.

35:58.656 --> 36:02.034
No, no. Use your shoulders.
Break the glass.

36:02.869 --> 36:04.620
I just got kicked by a horse.

36:04.745 --> 36:07.206
Can I take five minutes off
from, like, bashing myself?

36:07.290 --> 36:08.833
-Okay, I'm sorry.
-Okay.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.921
I'm just concerned the heel's
just gonna snap off.

36:14.005 --> 36:15.506
No. Not if you do it
exactly perpendicular,

36:15.590 --> 36:16.841
'cause it's a small
surface area. Pressure is--

36:16.924 --> 36:18.676
Okay. How do you know that?

36:19.760 --> 36:20.970
<i>MythBusters.</i>

36:21.971 --> 36:23.723
So you do like reality shows.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.100
Eh, it's more of a docuseries.

36:31.522 --> 36:32.773
-Ow! Oops.
- Oh!

36:33.316 --> 36:34.609
Ow!

36:34.692 --> 36:36.819
I remember now.
That myth got busted.

36:43.075 --> 36:44.744
<i>...reportedly</i>
<i>ran over the cyclist</i>

36:44.827 --> 36:45.912
<i>multiple times.</i>

36:46.037 --> 36:47.121
<i>Two witnesses at the scene</i>

36:47.205 --> 36:49.248
<i>are currently being treated</i>
<i>for emotional distress.</i>

36:53.002 --> 36:54.795
I think this is it.

37:01.719 --> 37:03.554
What if there's someone
in there?

37:03.638 --> 37:04.972
Looks empty.

37:05.723 --> 37:06.891
Right, 'cause it's
probably empty

37:06.974 --> 37:08.976
'cause it's Bicycle's
apartment and he's...

37:09.518 --> 37:10.603
-Yeah.
-dead.

37:10.686 --> 37:12.313
Yeah, I was there, Jibran.

37:12.605 --> 37:14.732
-Just try the window.
-Okay.

37:16.484 --> 37:18.402
It's locked.

37:18.569 --> 37:20.571
Okay, your turn to kick it.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.031
My shoes aren't made
for kicking.

37:22.114 --> 37:23.866
Yeah, neither were mine.

37:25.409 --> 37:26.410
In my defense,

37:26.494 --> 37:27.995
the heel on the kicking shoe
didn't break off,

37:28.079 --> 37:29.080
it was the heel
on the standing--

37:29.163 --> 37:30.164
Jibran, I will throw you
down this catwalk.

37:30.248 --> 37:32.416
I shouldn't have said that.
Sorry you broke your shoes.

37:32.500 --> 37:34.460
Thank you,
they were my date shoes.

37:34.543 --> 37:35.878
I didn't know
you had date shoes.

37:36.796 --> 37:38.005
I got 'em for you.

37:41.467 --> 37:44.637
Can you kick this in quietly,
please, since I'm barefoot?

37:44.762 --> 37:46.681
Okay. Okay. Okay.

37:48.224 --> 37:50.142
Okay, okay, here we go,
here we go.

37:53.771 --> 37:56.357
What? What are you doing?
Are you knocking?

37:56.565 --> 37:59.235
No! I just wanna pull back
so I don't cut up my hand.

37:59.318 --> 38:00.653
I make my living
with these hands.

38:18.212 --> 38:19.422
Shit.

38:29.765 --> 38:31.475
Help me,
help me, help me.

38:33.060 --> 38:34.103
-Ow.

38:39.483 --> 38:41.110
-You okay?
-Yes, I'm okay.

38:41.485 --> 38:43.070
-Okay.

38:50.494 --> 38:53.080
-Wait, you hear that?
-Hear what?

38:53.331 --> 38:54.707
That.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.752
There's, like,
music happening.

38:58.836 --> 39:01.922
-We should go in there.
-What? No.

39:02.006 --> 39:03.716
What else are we gonna do?
Go back outside?

39:03.799 --> 39:06.385
Okay, okay, okay.
We're just gonna take a peek.

39:19.523 --> 39:20.524
What is--

39:20.608 --> 39:23.110
No, dude.
Shut the fuck up, okay?

39:23.194 --> 39:24.445
I remember this shit
plain as day.

39:24.528 --> 39:26.280
You were the one
that was fucking passed out.

39:26.364 --> 39:27.948
Because I-- No.

39:28.240 --> 39:31.827
No, it was me,
it was Boyd Ashley. Ashley.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.287
And I ate that day

39:33.371 --> 39:34.914
'cause I was
in a bulking phase.

39:35.623 --> 39:37.583
Who are
all these frat dudes?

39:37.666 --> 39:40.002
It's like
a roofie laboratory in there.

39:40.086 --> 39:42.671
Those must be the photos
that Edie was talking about.

39:44.548 --> 39:46.801
He left one of
the envelopes right there.

39:47.468 --> 39:49.303
-We gotta go get it.
-Don't do it!

39:49.845 --> 39:51.806
All those fuckboys
are in there.

39:51.972 --> 39:53.265
I don't exactly know
what that means.

39:53.349 --> 39:55.142
-Did I use it right?
-No, you didn't.

39:55.226 --> 39:56.852
-What are fuckboys?
-I'm not having

39:56.936 --> 39:58.813
this conversation right now
with you. Okay--

39:58.938 --> 40:00.314
No, no, no.

40:00.398 --> 40:01.649
No, it's fine,
they can't hear us.

40:01.732 --> 40:03.734
The music's too loud. Watch.

40:08.072 --> 40:09.949
We need to go in there,

40:10.032 --> 40:11.325
grab one o' those envelopes,

40:11.409 --> 40:12.410
and we figure out
what the fuck is goin' on.

40:12.493 --> 40:14.912
But all the Abercrombie
& Fitch people will see us.

40:15.746 --> 40:18.249
Okay, okay, okay,
we gotta, um...

40:19.500 --> 40:21.252
We gotta come up
with a plan to distract them,

40:21.335 --> 40:22.670
pull them out of there.

40:23.838 --> 40:25.297
I got it! You stay here.

40:25.381 --> 40:26.674
I'll gonna go out,
ring the doorbell.

40:26.757 --> 40:27.758
I'm gonna say,
"Pizza delivery."

40:30.886 --> 40:32.471
Oh, hey, wassup?

40:32.555 --> 40:34.598
Hey, man, it's been a minute.

40:34.765 --> 40:36.350
Who the fuck are you?

40:36.434 --> 40:38.519
-It's her and me!
-Me and him!

40:38.644 --> 40:39.728
Yes!

40:39.812 --> 40:40.813
From, uh...

40:44.275 --> 40:46.193
- Oh, no.

40:47.027 --> 40:49.238
Get him, Jibran!
Fuck him up, Jibran!

40:49.321 --> 40:52.616
-Fuck him up! Fuck him up!
-I'm trying! Stop saying that!

40:55.786 --> 40:56.954
Tell me when
you want me to jump in.

40:57.037 --> 40:58.998
-You want me to jump in?

40:59.248 --> 41:01.459
This isn't Ultimate Fighting,
Jibran. You can't tap out.

41:08.048 --> 41:09.258
I got you!

41:09.884 --> 41:12.470
-You're hitting me!
-You're in the way. Move!

41:12.553 --> 41:14.054
Hey, help!

41:14.763 --> 41:15.764
Take that!

41:17.975 --> 41:18.976
Oh.

41:29.737 --> 41:31.113
Fuck!

41:34.283 --> 41:36.368
Who the fuck are you?

41:38.370 --> 41:39.622
Who the fuck are we?

41:40.498 --> 41:43.000
We're the people
who want some answers, bitch!

41:43.751 --> 41:46.795
The bigger question is,
who the fuck are you?

41:47.129 --> 41:49.298
What are you doing
in my fucking room?

41:49.924 --> 41:51.675
Um... We're here...

41:53.385 --> 41:55.721
Ow! Why would you do that?

41:57.681 --> 42:00.309
Yeah... Why would we do that?

42:00.851 --> 42:02.394
That's what you wanna know.

42:02.770 --> 42:04.480
We're asking the questions.

42:04.605 --> 42:06.482
And the answers
to our questions

42:06.565 --> 42:07.900
better be answers.

42:07.983 --> 42:09.902
But the answers
to your questions

42:09.985 --> 42:11.070
are gonna be my fists.

42:11.445 --> 42:12.446
What?

42:12.696 --> 42:14.365
-Ow!
-First of all, motherfucker,

42:14.448 --> 42:16.283
-who do you work for?
-Yeah, motherfucker!

42:16.367 --> 42:17.785
I don't know
what you're talking about.

42:17.868 --> 42:19.578
Don't pee down my back
and tell me it's raining.

42:19.662 --> 42:22.164
-Don't do it. Don't do it.
-We don't like it.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.124
-Nope.
-'Cause we know you're lying,

42:24.333 --> 42:26.377
and then we have piss
on our backs.

42:26.460 --> 42:28.045
I would never do that.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.296
So tell us what we wanna know.

42:29.380 --> 42:31.632
Yeah. Do you know Bicycle?

42:31.715 --> 42:34.009
Do I know Bicycle?
What does that mean?

42:34.093 --> 42:36.220
-Bicycle! Two wheels?
-Handlebars?

42:36.303 --> 42:39.181
-Sometimes there's a basket.
-And sometimes there's spokes.

42:39.265 --> 42:42.142
Yeah, ET rode one
and flew in it, bitch!

42:42.434 --> 42:44.478
I know what a bicycle is.
Do you mean Tom?

42:44.645 --> 42:46.564
I don't know.
Do we look like a bitch?

42:47.064 --> 42:48.482
Fine. I work for Tom.

42:48.566 --> 42:49.775
Uh, Tom rides a bicycle.

42:49.858 --> 42:51.151
He's like a weird
environmentalist.

42:51.235 --> 42:54.822
Is environmentalism weird
or is it absolutely necessary?

42:54.905 --> 42:56.949
I recycle everything!

42:57.032 --> 42:58.450
Yeah. Sometimes
she'll try and recycle

42:58.534 --> 42:59.910
eggshells and banana peels,

42:59.994 --> 43:01.912
and I'll be like,
"That's more compost."

43:01.996 --> 43:04.498
Okay, focus back on me,
little Brett Kavanaugh.

43:04.665 --> 43:06.041
What do you do for Tom?

43:06.125 --> 43:07.835
Uh-- Uh--
I'm not supposed to say.

43:07.918 --> 43:09.753
Shut the fuck up and talk,
Chug-A-Lug Chuck!

43:10.004 --> 43:11.046
How am I supposed
to shut the fuck up

43:11.130 --> 43:13.090
and talk at the same time?
That's impossible!

43:13.173 --> 43:15.134
-Figure that shit out!
- Figure it out.

43:15.217 --> 43:17.803
Please, all we do is, we stuff
these envelopes. Okay?

43:18.053 --> 43:19.305
And then we have
to deliver them

43:19.388 --> 43:21.348
-to these, like, rich people.
-What rich people?

43:22.141 --> 43:23.475
I don't-- I don't know, okay?

43:23.559 --> 43:25.978
Uh, he works
at this, like, uh, club.

43:26.061 --> 43:27.229
And these people are...

43:27.438 --> 43:28.522
These people
are dangerous, okay?

43:28.606 --> 43:31.150
You don't want to fuck
with these people, okay?

43:31.859 --> 43:34.862
Ow! I have been
100% cooperating!

43:34.945 --> 43:36.780
I don't like your tone,
Date Rape McGee.

43:41.994 --> 43:44.413
So tell us where the fuck
this club is.

43:44.496 --> 43:46.290
I don't know.
Because they don't tell us.

43:46.373 --> 43:47.499
They said
the less that we know,

43:47.583 --> 43:48.542
the better, okay?

43:48.626 --> 43:50.377
They only contact him
on his phone.

43:54.465 --> 43:57.217
Oh, fuck, Jesus!
Please help, help, please!

43:57.384 --> 43:59.219
Intruders, intruders! Help!

43:59.470 --> 44:00.929
-Oh!
- Hi, Steve.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.348
- Please, don't--

44:03.766 --> 44:04.933
We gotta get out of here.

44:05.017 --> 44:06.477
Come on, this way.

44:35.047 --> 44:36.882
-Shit.

44:40.386 --> 44:41.970
-Hello?

44:43.847 --> 44:45.974
Yeah. I took care
of the problem.

44:50.938 --> 44:52.439
Yeah, he's <i>quod mortem.</i>

44:53.899 --> 44:54.983
Mmm-hmm.

44:57.152 --> 44:58.237
I understand.

45:00.072 --> 45:01.073
Yeah.

45:02.574 --> 45:04.701
Yeah, I'll make sure
it goes smoothly tonight.

45:05.369 --> 45:07.496
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

45:07.579 --> 45:08.914
Hang on a second.

45:16.130 --> 45:17.548
Go, go, go, go, go.

45:23.554 --> 45:26.098
I can hear you
better now. Go ahead.

45:48.120 --> 45:50.164
I just saw two people
get murdered.

45:50.706 --> 45:53.876
Until yesterday, I had seen
zero people get murdered.

45:54.460 --> 45:56.128
That could've easily been us.

45:56.211 --> 45:58.172
Oh, my God, there's blood
on my knuckles.

45:58.255 --> 46:00.466
I left my DNA
at the crime scene.

46:00.549 --> 46:03.218
Shit, I left my fingerprints
on Date Rape's face.

46:03.552 --> 46:05.888
And now I feel really bad
for calling him Date Rape.

46:06.805 --> 46:08.891
The police are gonna think
we killed him, too.

46:08.974 --> 46:11.018
They're gonna think
we're, like, serial killers.

46:12.227 --> 46:13.645
We gotta figure this shit out.

46:15.147 --> 46:16.648
Open it. Open it.

46:23.238 --> 46:24.656
What is this?

46:28.660 --> 46:29.745
What is this?

46:31.413 --> 46:33.415
"Dear Mrs. Burrows,
There are many.

46:33.499 --> 46:34.541
We know you are one."

46:34.625 --> 46:35.834
What else? What else?

46:40.339 --> 46:41.548
That-That's it.

46:42.090 --> 46:44.760
This is like <i>The Amazing Race,</i>
but with dead people.

46:45.511 --> 46:46.512
Wait.

46:47.221 --> 46:48.347
We have to get
into Bicycle's phone.

46:48.430 --> 46:49.890
He said this is how
they contact him.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.518
I'm gonna start guessing
passwords. Important dates.

46:52.601 --> 46:54.853
1-4-9-2. Nope.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.730
-1-7-7-6. Nope.
-Ugh.

46:56.813 --> 46:57.814
What, are you gonna guess

46:57.898 --> 46:59.733
every impressive date
in history? Stop.

47:00.150 --> 47:01.527
Right. He was a bicycle fan.

47:01.610 --> 47:02.986
What was the year
that Lance Armstrong

47:03.070 --> 47:04.780
won his first Tour de France?

47:04.947 --> 47:07.115
-1-9--
-Stop, stop, stop.

47:07.199 --> 47:08.659
Okay? You're gonna lock us
out of the phone

47:08.742 --> 47:10.369
and then we're literally
gonna have nothing else.

47:10.869 --> 47:11.954
Okay.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.958
I know who can get us
into the phone.

47:16.542 --> 47:18.460
-Who?
-Keith.

47:19.211 --> 47:21.588
-Keith?
-He's our IT guy, okay?

47:21.672 --> 47:24.091
-Oh, really?
-And he's a genius
at this type of stuff.

47:24.174 --> 47:26.593
Oh, he's a genius? Wow!

47:27.052 --> 47:28.804
You guys are so lucky
to have a genius

47:28.887 --> 47:30.556
working at your office
as the IT guy.

47:30.639 --> 47:31.807
I'm not trying to hype him up.

47:31.890 --> 47:33.809
But if anybody can do it,
he can do it.

47:33.892 --> 47:36.478
Errol Morris is a genius.
JK Rowling is a genius.

47:36.687 --> 47:38.313
You could even say
Lil Wayne is a genius.

47:38.397 --> 47:39.982
But Keith? Fucking Keith?

47:40.065 --> 47:41.692
What is your deal with him?
Why are you so--

47:41.775 --> 47:43.360
I don't like the way
he looks at you.

47:43.735 --> 47:45.571
He doesn't look at me
like anything.

47:46.905 --> 47:48.073
Well, then...

47:49.533 --> 47:51.535
I don't like the way
you look at him.

47:58.125 --> 48:01.086
Look, do you wanna
get into this phone or not?

48:01.169 --> 48:03.130
'Cause this could be
our only chance.

48:11.263 --> 48:12.806
All right. We're gonna
go in for five minutes,

48:12.889 --> 48:14.600
get the phone unlocked,
and we are leaving.

48:14.683 --> 48:15.684
No, wait.

48:15.767 --> 48:16.852
We can't just go in there

48:16.935 --> 48:18.812
and ask Keith
to hack into a random phone.

48:18.895 --> 48:20.814
'Cause he's really ethical
about this kind of stuff.

48:20.897 --> 48:23.900
Oh, he's really ethical,
but he's okay stealing comedy?

48:24.067 --> 48:25.611
This guy's
a real question mark.

48:25.694 --> 48:27.738
Help me come up
with something believable.

48:30.490 --> 48:32.492
- Everyone!

48:32.576 --> 48:34.161
Look who finally showed up.

48:34.244 --> 48:37.414
-About fucking time! Hey.

48:37.497 --> 48:39.124
Sorry we're so late.

48:39.541 --> 48:41.835
-Oh, hey, Keith is here.
-Hi.

48:42.961 --> 48:44.880
Oh, my God,
this all looks so good.

48:44.963 --> 48:47.924
Oh, Reya, you have
outdone yourself!

48:48.300 --> 48:49.343
Oh, my God!

48:49.718 --> 48:51.345
Did you try this, guys?

48:51.511 --> 48:54.973
Oh, my God,
that is to die for!

48:55.057 --> 48:57.225
These are some of the best--
things we've had.

48:57.309 --> 48:58.477
Whoa, it's so fresh!

48:58.560 --> 48:59.978
So these are red,
there's green ones.

49:00.062 --> 49:01.563
What other pepper colors
do you got?

49:01.647 --> 49:02.564
There's also yellow.

49:02.648 --> 49:04.650
I wasn't asking you, Keith.
I was asking Reya.

49:05.025 --> 49:06.109
Are you guys okay?

49:06.193 --> 49:07.486
-Us?
-So good.

49:07.569 --> 49:09.154
-We're fucking great.
-A-OK. One hundred.

49:09.237 --> 49:10.864
And what the fuck
are you wearing?

49:10.947 --> 49:11.948
What the fuck am I wearing?

49:12.032 --> 49:13.450
What the fuck
are you wearing, dude?

49:14.242 --> 49:15.243
Turtleneck.

49:15.661 --> 49:17.371
Is that blood on your face?

49:17.496 --> 49:19.831
And it's a big disgrace.

49:20.916 --> 49:23.126
We actually do have some news.

49:23.293 --> 49:24.378
Um...

49:24.461 --> 49:26.421
-Jibran, tell them.
-We box now.

49:28.131 --> 49:29.299
Boxing?

49:29.383 --> 49:32.302
We actually just took a class
before we came here.

49:32.386 --> 49:36.223
And Jibran boxed outside
of his weight class.

49:36.390 --> 49:38.058
It was incredible.

49:38.141 --> 49:40.894
I'm what they call a "bleeder"
in the boxing biz.

49:41.269 --> 49:43.730
They actually said I could
never be a professional boxer

49:43.814 --> 49:45.440
because of how much I bleed.

49:45.649 --> 49:49.111
So the reason you were late
was because you were boxing?

49:49.194 --> 49:50.654
Yeah!

49:51.154 --> 49:52.155
Uh...

49:52.823 --> 49:54.574
Oh, my God,
I have such a good idea!

49:54.950 --> 49:56.410
Do you guys wanna see

49:56.493 --> 49:58.453
a video of Jibran
getting knocked out?

49:58.537 --> 50:00.122
-Yeah, definitely.

50:00.455 --> 50:02.290
Pull out
your phone, honey.

50:05.127 --> 50:06.461
Okay.

50:07.963 --> 50:08.964
What?

50:09.047 --> 50:12.884
I can't remember my passcode
to my phone.

50:13.510 --> 50:15.095
Oh, my God! Do you think that

50:15.178 --> 50:16.805
it's all of the hits
that you took to your head

50:16.888 --> 50:17.889
while boxing?

50:20.517 --> 50:21.393
Is it a new passcode?

50:21.476 --> 50:23.145
No, Keith,
it's not a new passcode!

50:23.562 --> 50:24.813
Good question, though.

50:25.147 --> 50:28.442
Oh, my God!
Do I have a brain... brain...

50:29.276 --> 50:30.402
brain injury?

50:30.485 --> 50:31.945
Call your doctor.

50:32.446 --> 50:34.531
Yeah, I'll call Doctor...

50:34.656 --> 50:36.116
You don't
remember his name!

50:36.199 --> 50:37.284
His name
is in the phone,

50:37.367 --> 50:38.618
but I can't
get into the phone,

50:38.702 --> 50:40.370
-so I can't even google it!
-How do--

50:40.454 --> 50:43.331
If only we could unlock
the phone. Oh, no...

50:43.415 --> 50:45.000
-It's okay.
- Huh?

50:45.292 --> 50:46.543
I can get into your phone.

50:46.710 --> 50:47.961
Oh, you don't have to do that.

50:48.253 --> 50:49.838
-I wanna help.
-Okay, let's do it right now!

50:55.135 --> 50:57.763
This thing's a wreck.
You need a new phone, man.

50:57.929 --> 50:59.514
You need a new phone.

50:59.598 --> 51:01.099
-What?
-What?

51:01.183 --> 51:02.934
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm good.

51:03.018 --> 51:04.019
Okay.

51:04.561 --> 51:05.937
I'm just running
the rainbow tables here,

51:06.021 --> 51:07.314
about halfway through.

51:07.939 --> 51:09.399
I was actually gonna run
a brute-force algorithm,

51:09.483 --> 51:10.609
but this'll be a lot faster.

51:10.692 --> 51:12.360
It'll be faster, yeah.
Good call.

51:12.611 --> 51:13.945
Oh, you know about it?

51:14.112 --> 51:15.781
-Yeah, know all about it.
-Awesome.

51:15.947 --> 51:18.450
'Cause a brute-force
algorithm would brutally force

51:18.784 --> 51:21.661
the rhythm of Al Gore,

51:22.078 --> 51:25.665
uh, while rainbow tables are
sort of more the spectrum of

51:26.666 --> 51:28.585
Roy G. Biv and all that, so...

51:29.252 --> 51:30.253
Roy G. Biv?

51:30.796 --> 51:33.089
Roy Greg Biv.
Discovered rainbows.

51:34.299 --> 51:36.092
And now he takes up boxing.

51:36.176 --> 51:37.803
-Reya...

51:37.886 --> 51:39.513
Jibran and I broke up.

51:39.596 --> 51:41.097
Oh, my God, are you serious?

51:41.848 --> 51:44.559
How is that even possible?
You're like
the best couple ever.

51:44.643 --> 51:45.644
Us?

51:45.727 --> 51:47.771
You and Bobby are the perfect
couple. Are you kidding?

51:47.854 --> 51:49.981
Oh, no, Bobby and I
fight all the time.

51:50.357 --> 51:52.901
Yeah, but you guys
have sex constantly.

51:52.984 --> 51:54.820
Like doing all kinds
of freaky shit.

51:54.903 --> 51:57.322
Oh, no.
Why would you think that?

51:57.405 --> 51:58.907
'Cause you post
those hot pictures

51:58.990 --> 52:01.034
-of you and Bobby in bed.
-Oh.

52:01.201 --> 52:02.369
Two of my exes follow me.

52:02.452 --> 52:04.037
I'm just trying
to make them jealous.

52:05.330 --> 52:06.790
Yeah, it's not...

52:07.582 --> 52:10.168
So where'd you learn this
stuff? Like, MIT or something?

52:10.252 --> 52:12.587
Me?  Yeah, right.

52:12.671 --> 52:15.006
Nothing like that.
You're the fancy one here.

52:16.007 --> 52:17.008
What?

52:17.425 --> 52:19.636
Yeah, Leilani's told me
all about you.

52:19.719 --> 52:21.513
Sound like
a very impressive guy.

52:23.348 --> 52:25.267
-She talks about me?
-Yeah.

52:26.017 --> 52:28.144
She brags about you
all the time.

52:38.613 --> 52:39.656
Look at that.

52:40.365 --> 52:41.366
We're in.

52:53.628 --> 52:55.755
-Can you do me a favor?
-Yeah, anything.

52:55.964 --> 52:58.258
Ever since Ji and I broke up,
I've been super emotional,

52:58.341 --> 53:00.385
and I have
all these dick pics,

53:00.468 --> 53:03.597
and I just need someone

53:03.680 --> 53:05.974
to hold onto them for me
till I'm emotionally ready.

53:06.391 --> 53:08.435
-You printed them out?
-I did.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.145
Just put them--
Don't open 'em.

53:10.228 --> 53:12.647
Just put them
in a safe place, okay?

53:12.939 --> 53:14.608
"Senator Burrow"?

53:14.733 --> 53:16.484
Mmm-hmm,
that's what I call it.

53:16.568 --> 53:19.029
'Cause he be burrowing
all up in there!

53:19.112 --> 53:20.989
- Okay.

53:21.072 --> 53:23.033
And you said
I get freaky and shit.

53:23.408 --> 53:24.910
Hey! Um...

53:25.076 --> 53:27.412
-So Keith unlocked my phone.
-Great!

53:27.537 --> 53:29.289
Yeah, my doctor's at a party.

53:29.372 --> 53:31.374
He'll see me,
but we have to go right now.

53:31.833 --> 53:33.084
Okay, let's go.

53:33.168 --> 53:34.878
We cannot go
dressed like this, though.

53:34.961 --> 53:36.171
Why not?

53:36.713 --> 53:39.049
Oh, he's at
a fancy benefit, so...

53:39.132 --> 53:41.468
Can we borrow some
nice clothes from you, Rey?

53:41.551 --> 53:43.178
Yeah. Right this way.

53:49.225 --> 53:50.435
Oh. Yeah.

53:50.518 --> 53:51.686
What are you doing?

53:51.770 --> 53:53.063
Turning around
so you can change.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.441
It's not like you haven't
seen this a million times.

53:56.566 --> 53:57.651
Okay.

54:00.153 --> 54:01.947
-Actually, turn around, yeah.
-A little weird.

54:04.449 --> 54:05.951
Are you ready for this?

54:06.034 --> 54:08.286
No.
But I'm glad we're together.

54:08.370 --> 54:09.621
Me, too.

54:09.704 --> 54:11.748
Listen. If I don't make it,

54:11.831 --> 54:13.375
you could do
a lot worse than Keith.

54:13.458 --> 54:15.919
I would never date
anyone who steals comedy.

54:26.054 --> 54:27.347
You know, I'mma finish
getting dressed outside

54:27.430 --> 54:28.974
so you can
get dressed in here.

54:29.057 --> 54:30.058
Okay.

54:30.141 --> 54:32.394
-Shoes.
-Guess I don't need these.

54:32.477 --> 54:34.729
-Yeah. Trade you.
-Thanks.

54:35.522 --> 54:36.940
See you later, crocodile.

54:37.273 --> 54:38.358
Okay.

54:52.998 --> 54:54.332
You look great.

54:54.833 --> 54:55.875
Thank you.

54:58.253 --> 55:00.463
-Ready?
-Yeah, ready.

55:00.714 --> 55:01.548
For our doctor's!

55:01.631 --> 55:02.841
Yeah, my doctor's, with the...

55:02.924 --> 55:04.175
- Yeah.
- Have a great night!

55:04.259 --> 55:05.552
four concussions.

55:09.431 --> 55:11.474
Oh, no.
It's the cops again.

55:18.982 --> 55:20.150
Ma'am, it's a little
quiet in here.

55:20.233 --> 55:22.193
Do you mind turning on
some music or something?

55:22.277 --> 55:24.154
-Yeah. Of course.
-Thank you.

55:30.618 --> 55:32.370
-What?
-This used to be our jam.

55:32.454 --> 55:34.289
This has never
once been our jam.

55:34.372 --> 55:35.707
Do not act like
you don't like this song

55:35.790 --> 55:36.791
like the rest of the world.

55:36.875 --> 55:39.002
I do not like this song
like the rest of the world.

55:39.711 --> 55:43.131
<i>♪ Do you ever feel</i>
<i>Feel so paper thin ♪</i>

55:43.465 --> 55:45.383
<i>♪ Like a house of cards... ♪</i>

55:45.467 --> 55:46.718
I know what you're doing.

55:46.801 --> 55:48.178
Whenever I'm stressed out,
you try and get me

55:48.261 --> 55:49.888
to sing along to songs,
and it never works.

55:49.971 --> 55:52.223
It always works.
You just gotta be open to it.

55:54.768 --> 55:56.895
Don't do this.
Please don't do this.

55:56.978 --> 55:58.897
I'm just not in the mood.

55:59.105 --> 56:00.065
<i>♪ There's a spark in you ♪</i>

56:00.148 --> 56:01.524
Can you just
sing in your head?

56:01.608 --> 56:05.195
<i>♪ You just gotta ignite</i>
<i>The light ♪</i>

56:06.196 --> 56:08.948

56:53.201 --> 56:54.285
Phone?

56:56.621 --> 56:57.914
- Okay.

56:59.833 --> 57:00.834
Go ahead.

57:01.167 --> 57:02.627
Oh.  Yeah.

57:02.794 --> 57:03.878
Thank you.

57:16.182 --> 57:18.017
Thank you so much.

57:34.159 --> 57:36.202
What is this place?

57:36.286 --> 57:38.496
I don't know,
but it's fucking creepy.

57:45.503 --> 57:47.714
-That's Edie.
-What if she recognizes us?

58:08.485 --> 58:10.528
Oh, shit.

58:14.532 --> 58:16.367
Why is it so quiet?

58:20.038 --> 58:21.956
Hi, can we, um...

58:23.082 --> 58:24.167
Sorry.

58:25.668 --> 58:28.505
-Sorry. Thank you.
-Excuse me.

58:28.755 --> 58:31.132
-Hi.
-Oh, it's so sharp.

58:32.050 --> 58:35.011
Excuse me. Sorry.

58:35.803 --> 58:36.888
Sorry.

58:51.319 --> 58:54.948
We are one.
We are Sacrarium.

58:55.448 --> 58:59.035
We are many. We are Sacrarium.

58:59.244 --> 59:01.329
- We are many.
- We are one.

59:01.412 --> 59:03.748
We are Sacrarium.

59:03.831 --> 59:04.832
We are one--

59:17.178 --> 59:18.304
<i>Welcome,</i>

59:18.388 --> 59:21.641
Membra Autem Sacrarium.

59:22.100 --> 59:25.687
<i>From the time</i>
<i>of Hermes Trismegistus,</i>

59:25.853 --> 59:27.522
<i>Hermes the Thrice-Blessed...</i>

59:27.605 --> 59:30.108
This is some
Illuminati bullshit.

59:30.733 --> 59:32.026
<i>...to build the pyramids</i>

59:32.110 --> 59:34.696
<i>to the Hermetic Order</i>
<i>of the Golden Dawn.</i>

59:34.779 --> 59:35.863
Light the fire
of knowledge.

59:35.947 --> 59:36.948
L'Eggo my Eggo.

59:37.031 --> 59:38.116
Where's the beef?

59:38.449 --> 59:41.786
<i>This unbroken chain of wisdom</i>

59:41.953 --> 59:45.290
<i>shall be handed down</i>
<i>to ten initiates.</i>

59:45.540 --> 59:49.168
The few become
many become one.

1:00:05.018 --> 1:00:06.394
<i>Fifty-one.</i>

1:00:09.272 --> 1:00:10.773
Is this Bingo?

1:00:11.190 --> 1:00:12.191
I like Bingo.

1:00:13.693 --> 1:00:14.902
<i>Seventeen.</i>

1:00:18.573 --> 1:00:19.657
<i>Six.</i>

1:00:20.658 --> 1:00:21.993
<i>Twenty-three.</i>

1:00:22.410 --> 1:00:23.703
Did they win?

1:00:24.829 --> 1:00:25.830
<i>Fourteen.</i>

1:00:27.123 --> 1:00:29.083
I don't think
we're supposed to do that.

1:00:29.167 --> 1:00:30.376
<i>Seventy-two.</i>

1:00:33.212 --> 1:00:34.631
<i>Forty-four.</i>

1:00:35.048 --> 1:00:36.382
Where are they going?

1:00:37.467 --> 1:00:38.676
<i>Thirty-four.</i>

1:00:39.510 --> 1:00:40.928
Do we want
our names to be called?

1:00:41.012 --> 1:00:42.430
I don't know.
I don't think so.

1:00:42.513 --> 1:00:45.600
<i>And the final number is...</i>

1:00:48.102 --> 1:00:49.854
<i>Ninety-nine.</i>

1:00:51.439 --> 1:00:53.650
<i>Let the ceremony begin.</i>

1:00:57.362 --> 1:00:59.447
-Oh, no, that's not the vibe.
-Mmm-hmm.

1:01:02.617 --> 1:01:05.036
What is happening?

1:01:17.340 --> 1:01:19.509
I think they're gonna, um...

1:01:20.551 --> 1:01:23.388
Yeah, that's what
I thought was gonna happen.

1:01:26.265 --> 1:01:27.725
No, they didn't.

1:01:27.809 --> 1:01:30.228
-Uh, yes, they did.
-Yes, they did.

1:01:32.939 --> 1:01:34.732
You know, I'm actually
not hating this.

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:35.983
Yeah, you've made your, um,

1:01:36.067 --> 1:01:37.527
thoughts on orgies
quite clear.

1:01:37.610 --> 1:01:39.362
Do you think they're gonna
call more numbers?

1:01:42.073 --> 1:01:44.659
-This is spontaneous.
-This is not spontaneous!

1:01:44.742 --> 1:01:46.661
I bet all these people had it
on their Google Cal.

1:01:53.835 --> 1:01:55.336
Stop!

1:01:56.838 --> 1:01:58.464
Go away!

1:02:04.470 --> 1:02:06.806
I love that they actually
respect the word "stop."

1:02:13.187 --> 1:02:15.064
There is a traitor

1:02:15.148 --> 1:02:16.774
amongst us.

1:02:18.317 --> 1:02:20.903
A worker has violated

1:02:20.987 --> 1:02:23.239
the most sacred code
of Sacrarium.

1:02:23.865 --> 1:02:27.452
And for this,
he has paid a hefty price.

1:02:27.535 --> 1:02:30.663
He is <i>quod mortem.</i>

1:02:30.747 --> 1:02:32.331
- Jibran, my God.

1:02:32.415 --> 1:02:34.167
They hired Mustache
to kill Bicycle.

1:02:34.625 --> 1:02:36.711
Oh, shit.

1:02:36.794 --> 1:02:37.795
Silence!

1:02:37.879 --> 1:02:38.755
We should
get out of here.

1:02:38.838 --> 1:02:41.799
I have just learned
that this man's barcode

1:02:41.883 --> 1:02:45.762
has been used
to enter Sacrarium tonight.

1:02:45.845 --> 1:02:47.555
It's okay.

1:02:47.638 --> 1:02:51.309
We have imposters
in our ranks.

1:02:53.227 --> 1:02:55.229
Oh, no, imposters. That sucks.

1:02:55.646 --> 1:02:59.317
We must all reveal
our true faces,

1:02:59.400 --> 1:03:02.695
so that this imposter
may be rooted out

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.489
and dealt with.

1:03:05.114 --> 1:03:07.116
On my count of three,

1:03:07.492 --> 1:03:09.786
unmask yourselves.

1:03:10.369 --> 1:03:11.245
One...

1:03:11.329 --> 1:03:13.080
-Okay, okay, fuck, fuck.
-Are we gonna do it?

1:03:13.164 --> 1:03:14.207
Everyone's gonna
take their mask off.

1:03:14.290 --> 1:03:15.291
Two...

1:03:15.374 --> 1:03:17.084
Fuck, fuck,
we have to do it.

1:03:17.168 --> 1:03:18.377
If everybody else
is doing it.

1:03:18.461 --> 1:03:19.462
Three!

1:03:23.841 --> 1:03:24.967
Oh, fuck.

1:03:25.051 --> 1:03:26.844
A true member knows,

1:03:26.928 --> 1:03:29.263
you never take off your mask.

1:03:30.014 --> 1:03:31.766
Oh, my God,
that's them.

1:03:32.725 --> 1:03:33.601
Go! Go get 'em!

1:03:33.684 --> 1:03:34.727
-Oh, God.
- We are one.

1:03:35.186 --> 1:03:36.854
We are Sacrarium.

1:03:36.938 --> 1:03:39.023
Your burnt offerings

1:03:39.106 --> 1:03:41.234
shall be made to the gods,

1:03:41.317 --> 1:03:43.986
-and it shall replenish them.
-Oh! No! Stop! I'm a bleeder!

1:03:46.614 --> 1:03:47.907
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1:03:49.242 --> 1:03:50.076
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1:03:51.953 --> 1:03:53.204
<i>Evacuate.</i>

1:03:55.206 --> 1:03:56.207
What the fuck?

1:04:02.004 --> 1:04:04.549
What the fuck?
All the fuck people left.

1:04:04.632 --> 1:04:06.217
Are we having the same dream?

1:04:08.261 --> 1:04:10.137
-Um...
-Let's go.

1:04:10.221 --> 1:04:12.056
- Police!
- Go, go, go, go!

1:04:12.139 --> 1:04:14.267
- Oh, my God.
- Go, go, go, go!

1:04:14.892 --> 1:04:17.311
-Freeze! Hands in the air!
- Whoa. Whoa.

1:04:17.395 --> 1:04:18.646
Higher!

1:04:18.729 --> 1:04:21.148
-Higher!
-This is as high as they go.

1:04:23.734 --> 1:04:25.361
<i>Dispatch, that's a 10-95.</i>

1:04:25.444 --> 1:04:27.071
<i>They're in custody.</i>
<i>We're on our way back.</i>

1:04:44.338 --> 1:04:46.340
Detective Martin
will be here shortly.

1:04:52.430 --> 1:04:54.932
It's over. We're done.

1:04:56.809 --> 1:04:58.019
I know.

1:04:59.437 --> 1:05:01.272
I need to tell you something.

1:05:02.899 --> 1:05:03.983
Yeah?

1:05:06.027 --> 1:05:07.737
You remember when you

1:05:07.820 --> 1:05:10.448
went out of town
for Ben's bachelor party?

1:05:10.948 --> 1:05:12.617
You ate
all the peanut brittle.

1:05:12.783 --> 1:05:13.993
No.

1:05:14.869 --> 1:05:15.870
Yeah.

1:05:17.371 --> 1:05:18.789
I snuck into your office

1:05:18.873 --> 1:05:20.875
and I watched
your documentary.

1:05:21.292 --> 1:05:23.669
-You did what?
-I know, I'm sorry.

1:05:24.879 --> 1:05:26.297
But can I just say that

1:05:27.298 --> 1:05:29.467
it was really good.

1:05:33.471 --> 1:05:34.513
Why didn't you say something?

1:05:34.889 --> 1:05:36.933
Jibran, honestly, sometimes...

1:05:38.142 --> 1:05:40.311
I feel like you don't care
what I think.

1:05:43.773 --> 1:05:45.483
I care so much
about what you think.

1:05:45.650 --> 1:05:47.068
That's why I didn't
wanna show it to you.

1:05:47.151 --> 1:05:48.903
I was afraid
you wouldn't like it.

1:05:49.612 --> 1:05:51.197
You know, you've had
your life figured out

1:05:51.280 --> 1:05:52.782
since the moment we met.

1:05:53.741 --> 1:05:56.702
I always felt like you could
do so much better than me.

1:06:01.123 --> 1:06:02.625
You know, honestly, I...

1:06:03.084 --> 1:06:05.544
I feel like I don't have
anything figured out.

1:06:05.628 --> 1:06:07.254
Like, zero.

1:06:09.298 --> 1:06:10.466
But I was so obsessed

1:06:10.549 --> 1:06:11.926
with what
everybody else thought,

1:06:12.009 --> 1:06:14.971
except the one person
that I care about the most.

1:06:18.474 --> 1:06:20.393
I just want you to be happy.

1:06:22.770 --> 1:06:24.605
I want you to be happy, too.

1:06:29.568 --> 1:06:32.613
We'll still be friends,
laying out at the trial.

1:06:33.531 --> 1:06:35.116
Oh, no, I took a deal.

1:06:35.199 --> 1:06:36.659
-What?
-Nobody told you?

1:06:38.119 --> 1:06:39.787
Wait, but I thought
we'd have the same lawyer.

1:06:39.870 --> 1:06:41.622
I'm a rat all day.

1:06:41.706 --> 1:06:43.374
-It's done?
- Yeah, it's done.

1:06:43.457 --> 1:06:44.291
Ah, shit.

1:06:44.375 --> 1:06:47.211
I like them. I don't think
they should break up.

1:06:47.878 --> 1:06:49.755
Relationships are
a motherfucker.

1:06:50.131 --> 1:06:51.215
Yeah.

1:07:13.446 --> 1:07:15.573
We've been looking for you
all over this city.

1:07:18.909 --> 1:07:20.619
You guys are key witnesses
on a homicide,

1:07:20.703 --> 1:07:22.329
and the suspect
is still on the loose.

1:07:24.665 --> 1:07:25.666
What?

1:07:25.750 --> 1:07:27.209
We've been trying
to track you down all night

1:07:27.293 --> 1:07:28.419
to make sure you were safe.

1:07:28.836 --> 1:07:30.129
We tried calling your phone
several times.

1:07:30.212 --> 1:07:31.213
Wait, I'm sorry.

1:07:31.297 --> 1:07:33.382
You don't think
we're the murderers?

1:07:33.591 --> 1:07:34.675
No.

1:07:35.092 --> 1:07:36.010
There were traffic cameras

1:07:36.093 --> 1:07:37.094
that caught
the entire pursuit.

1:07:37.178 --> 1:07:38.512
-Uh-huh.
-I can't believe this.

1:07:38.721 --> 1:07:39.805
We're trying to
ID the individual

1:07:39.889 --> 1:07:41.348
who carjacked your vehicle.

1:07:41.766 --> 1:07:44.143
We know that he's responsible
for this incident as well as

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:46.854
multiple homicides
at the St. Charles Apartments.

1:07:46.937 --> 1:07:49.356
-A bunch of dead frat guys.
-Uh-- Okay--

1:07:50.566 --> 1:07:51.984
Just to be clear,

1:07:53.110 --> 1:07:57.406
we are not suspects
in a murder/homicide.

1:07:57.490 --> 1:07:59.325
-You know we didn't do this.
-We didn't do it.

1:07:59.408 --> 1:08:00.868
-And you know it.
-Of course you didn't do it.

1:08:01.077 --> 1:08:02.578
Why would two civilians

1:08:02.661 --> 1:08:04.622
violently murder a man
they've never even met?

1:08:04.705 --> 1:08:07.291
-Like, why would we...

1:08:07.374 --> 1:08:09.668
-It doesn't make sense.
-It doesn't make any sense.

1:08:09.752 --> 1:08:11.587
Oh, my God!

1:08:11.670 --> 1:08:12.838
That's right.

1:08:12.922 --> 1:08:15.091
I promise I have
never killed anyone.

1:08:15.299 --> 1:08:17.635
And I promise to never
kill anyone, Scout's honor.

1:08:17.718 --> 1:08:19.428
-Never. Never kill anybody.
-Never kill.

1:08:19.512 --> 1:08:22.348
Have I thought about killing
people? Like Jibran?

1:08:22.431 --> 1:08:23.974
All the time.
But I would never--

1:08:24.058 --> 1:08:25.601
-But that's in a normal way!
-No--

1:08:25.810 --> 1:08:27.269
She would never act on it.

1:08:27.353 --> 1:08:28.354
In the way where I'm like,

1:08:28.437 --> 1:08:30.314
"I will kill you,
I will wring your neck!"

1:08:30.397 --> 1:08:31.649
But not in the real
murder way.

1:08:31.732 --> 1:08:32.733
Not physically.

1:08:32.817 --> 1:08:34.318
I have rolled through
stop signs

1:08:34.401 --> 1:08:35.736
almost every day of my life,

1:08:35.820 --> 1:08:38.072
but not in a dangerous way.

1:08:38.155 --> 1:08:41.367
I used to sell, uh,
my uncle's edibles.

1:08:41.534 --> 1:08:43.494
He was always like,
"It's legal in Amsterdam."

1:08:43.577 --> 1:08:44.995
He could not point
to Amsterdam on a map, but--

1:08:45.079 --> 1:08:46.872
She did not sell them
in Amsterdam.

1:08:46.956 --> 1:08:48.165
She did sell them here.

1:08:48.249 --> 1:08:50.918
But to help people get high.

1:08:51.001 --> 1:08:53.003
Just glaucoma
and things like that.

1:08:53.087 --> 1:08:54.588
Yes, mostly.
She did make

1:08:54.672 --> 1:08:56.924
some money at a time
when we did need some money.

1:08:57.007 --> 1:08:59.260
We needed to pay some bills.
Wait, I'm sorry.

1:08:59.677 --> 1:09:03.264
So, did you guys catch
the... the cult people?

1:09:03.347 --> 1:09:04.723
The cult in
the theater with the people

1:09:04.807 --> 1:09:06.934
with the masks
and everybody was... sex.

1:09:07.184 --> 1:09:08.185
The lucky people had sex.

1:09:08.477 --> 1:09:09.478
They would go
on the round bed--

1:09:09.562 --> 1:09:10.396
There was music.

1:09:10.646 --> 1:09:12.606
-Yeah, they were having sex.
-In a very public place.

1:09:12.690 --> 1:09:14.024
Some people
were putting in work.

1:09:14.108 --> 1:09:15.151
There was a big round bed.

1:09:15.276 --> 1:09:16.527
Some people got right to it.

1:09:16.610 --> 1:09:18.988
They were... I will agree
they were putting in work.

1:09:19.155 --> 1:09:20.656
Yeah,
we saw all of that.

1:09:20.739 --> 1:09:23.868
And let me tell you, sis,
it was a sight.

1:09:24.368 --> 1:09:25.744
That's super helpful,

1:09:25.995 --> 1:09:27.872
but we know
all about Sacrarium.

1:09:27.955 --> 1:09:29.081
We've been tracking them
for months,

1:09:29.165 --> 1:09:30.291
and the raid tonight
was supposed to

1:09:30.374 --> 1:09:31.458
shut them down for good,

1:09:31.542 --> 1:09:33.544
but somebody tipped them off
that we were coming.

1:09:34.920 --> 1:09:36.088
Look,

1:09:36.297 --> 1:09:39.008
you guys witnessed
some horrific things.

1:09:39.633 --> 1:09:41.260
Eventually, we're gonna
need your statements,

1:09:41.343 --> 1:09:43.345
but I really think
that you two

1:09:43.429 --> 1:09:45.556
would benefit from some sleep.

1:09:45.890 --> 1:09:47.850
So why don't you come back
first thing in the morning

1:09:47.933 --> 1:09:49.852
and we'll get
your statements then.

1:09:50.186 --> 1:09:52.271
One of our guys out back
will take you home.

1:09:52.354 --> 1:09:53.606
And we'll keep an eye
on your place

1:09:53.689 --> 1:09:56.400
to make sure you're safe until
the suspect is apprehended.

1:09:57.109 --> 1:09:57.943
Thank you so much.

1:09:58.027 --> 1:09:59.153
This has been
a good experience.

1:09:59.320 --> 1:10:00.613
- I hope so.
-Thank you for everything.

1:10:00.696 --> 1:10:02.198
Is there a comment card?
'Cause I'm doing five.

1:10:02.406 --> 1:10:03.407
Fives down the line.

1:10:03.490 --> 1:10:04.658
Yeah, I would love
to just-- Okay?

1:10:15.586 --> 1:10:17.546
So, that's it?

1:10:17.796 --> 1:10:21.050
We just go back
to our normal lives?

1:10:21.342 --> 1:10:22.635
Like nothing happened?

1:10:23.844 --> 1:10:25.221
I guess so.

1:10:31.685 --> 1:10:32.686
Um...

1:10:34.855 --> 1:10:36.649
I could sleep
on the couch tonight.

1:10:36.732 --> 1:10:39.777
Oh, no, no, no. We can...
We can trade off.

1:10:39.944 --> 1:10:42.112
No, you should have the bed.

1:10:49.828 --> 1:10:51.413
This is crazy.
I know we didn't, like,

1:10:51.497 --> 1:10:53.624
solve the crime or whatever,

1:10:53.707 --> 1:10:55.542
but we got really close.

1:10:56.085 --> 1:10:57.294
I'm proud of us.

1:10:58.295 --> 1:11:00.339
Hey, not bad
for a couple rookies.

1:11:02.049 --> 1:11:03.968
You know, the one thing
I can't figure out is,

1:11:05.094 --> 1:11:06.387
who called the cops?

1:11:06.720 --> 1:11:07.888
I did.

1:11:10.724 --> 1:11:12.059
Remember me?

1:11:12.643 --> 1:11:14.561
How did you get in this car?

1:11:14.645 --> 1:11:15.896
I told you I was a cop.

1:11:16.397 --> 1:11:18.524
I've been on the force
for about 13 years.

1:11:18.607 --> 1:11:20.776
I'm actually kind of
a big deal over there.

1:11:21.485 --> 1:11:23.904
And you're a member
of the sex cult, too?

1:11:24.196 --> 1:11:25.197
Nah, they pay me

1:11:25.281 --> 1:11:26.365
to keep 'em safe
from the police.

1:11:26.657 --> 1:11:29.368
Wait, so you were protecting
the sex cult

1:11:30.619 --> 1:11:32.454
and also blackmailing
its members?

1:11:32.788 --> 1:11:34.164
As a matter of fact, I was.

1:11:34.248 --> 1:11:36.500
Do you know how much
this fucking city pays me?

1:11:36.667 --> 1:11:39.128
I put my life on the line
every single day

1:11:39.211 --> 1:11:41.255
and the government
tosses pennies at me.

1:11:41.797 --> 1:11:43.215
But you know
what is fucked up?

1:11:44.675 --> 1:11:46.468
That guy on the bicycle?

1:11:46.552 --> 1:11:48.846
The one I ran over
several times with your car?

1:11:49.013 --> 1:11:50.014
-I remember. You remember?
-Mmm-hmm.

1:11:50.097 --> 1:11:51.181
Yeah, we remember.

1:11:51.473 --> 1:11:52.683
That was my friend.

1:11:53.684 --> 1:11:57.688
Me and him, we come up with
the blackmail-the-cult scheme.

1:11:58.272 --> 1:12:01.692
But he got too greedy.
Stopped giving me my full cut.

1:12:01.775 --> 1:12:03.152
And then, against
my better judgment,

1:12:03.235 --> 1:12:05.654
he brought those
ignorant frat boys onboard.

1:12:05.821 --> 1:12:08.574
Sir, if I may,
we don't know anything,

1:12:08.657 --> 1:12:10.409
and we have terrible memories.

1:12:10.492 --> 1:12:12.536
So please just let us go,
you can trust us.

1:12:12.619 --> 1:12:14.830
Lady, I don't trust anyone.
Here's a little tip:

1:12:15.122 --> 1:12:17.750
The world is out to get you.

1:12:18.042 --> 1:12:20.627
The only one
who's got your back

1:12:20.794 --> 1:12:21.879
is you.

1:12:22.838 --> 1:12:24.840
-You're wrong.
-That's not true.

1:12:25.758 --> 1:12:28.510
I trusted someone. One person.

1:12:29.970 --> 1:12:31.138
Siobhan.

1:12:31.555 --> 1:12:33.849
I will never trust
anyone again.

1:12:34.558 --> 1:12:35.893
Never.

1:12:36.310 --> 1:12:38.437
You come into this world alone

1:12:38.520 --> 1:12:40.606
and you leave
this world alone.

1:12:40.689 --> 1:12:42.691
Which is what you two
are about to find out.

1:12:54.244 --> 1:12:55.662
Look,

1:12:56.330 --> 1:12:57.539
I'm sorry
I have to kill you guys.

1:12:57.623 --> 1:13:00.793
You seem like a nice, though
somewhat annoying couple.

1:13:00.876 --> 1:13:02.628
But if it makes you feel
any better,

1:13:02.920 --> 1:13:04.088
I will get over it.

1:13:04.171 --> 1:13:05.672
You don't
have to do this, okay?

1:13:05.798 --> 1:13:07.549
You're not a killer,
you're a good person.

1:13:08.050 --> 1:13:10.219
-I can see it in your eyes.
-Your eyes are so kind.

1:13:10.302 --> 1:13:11.553
They're luminous.

1:13:11.804 --> 1:13:14.348
Do you know how many people
I have killed today?

1:13:14.723 --> 1:13:16.475
Uh-- I would say
you've killed, like,

1:13:16.558 --> 1:13:18.352
exactly the right number
of people.

1:13:18.435 --> 1:13:19.520
I wouldn't add to it,

1:13:19.686 --> 1:13:21.355
'cause right now,
the number of people

1:13:21.438 --> 1:13:24.024
you've killed is impressive,
but not, like, worrying.

1:13:24.108 --> 1:13:25.359
Also, you killed a guy
on a bicycle

1:13:25.442 --> 1:13:26.610
and a bunch of frat boys.

1:13:26.693 --> 1:13:27.778
Who's kidding who?

1:13:27.861 --> 1:13:28.987
You're practically
a folk hero.

1:13:29.154 --> 1:13:30.739
That was
a rhetorical question.

1:13:31.573 --> 1:13:33.075
Never too late to change.

1:13:33.158 --> 1:13:35.119
Maybe if you do,
you can find a new Siobhan.

1:13:35.202 --> 1:13:37.996
Did I say that you could talk
about Siobhan?

1:13:38.080 --> 1:13:39.331
I thought you were sharing
and thought

1:13:39.415 --> 1:13:40.707
it was an open invitation,
but I wasn't--

1:13:40.791 --> 1:13:42.000
Listen,
Siobhan is clearly a tramp.

1:13:42.084 --> 1:13:43.127
You, too!

1:13:43.502 --> 1:13:45.421
Take her name
out of your mouth!

1:13:45.754 --> 1:13:48.173
I will never say
the name Siobhaaa again.

1:13:48.298 --> 1:13:49.466
She's dead to me.
I don't even--

1:13:49.550 --> 1:13:50.551
- She sucks.

1:13:50.634 --> 1:13:51.635
Shut up.

1:13:55.180 --> 1:13:56.723
He clearly isn't over Siobhan.

1:13:59.226 --> 1:14:01.395
Turn around. Put your hands
behind your back.

1:14:02.438 --> 1:14:05.232
You lay a hand on her
and I'll kick your ass, dude.

1:14:06.733 --> 1:14:08.485
- Turn around.
-Yes, sir.

1:14:10.904 --> 1:14:12.739
They have traffic cam footage
of you, man.

1:14:12.865 --> 1:14:14.158
You're so fucked.

1:14:14.241 --> 1:14:15.409
Nah, I saw it.

1:14:15.492 --> 1:14:16.660
It's very grainy.

1:14:16.743 --> 1:14:19.037
It's like, uh,
Bigfoot footage.

1:14:21.707 --> 1:14:23.667
Jibran, we can't just sit here
waiting to be killed, okay?

1:14:23.750 --> 1:14:24.918
-We need to do something.
-Okay.

1:14:25.002 --> 1:14:26.962
-Help me figure something out.
-Okay, okay.

1:14:27.045 --> 1:14:29.923
Um... Here,
uh, loosen my ties.

1:14:30.549 --> 1:14:31.967
-Can you do it?
-I can barely reach it.

1:14:32.050 --> 1:14:34.094
Okay,
it's just getting tighter. Ow.

1:14:34.178 --> 1:14:35.471
I'm sorry. Okay, try me.

1:14:35.554 --> 1:14:37.181
-Is it working?
-No. Oh, fuck!

1:14:37.347 --> 1:14:38.557
I'm gonna try
kicking this.

1:14:40.851 --> 1:14:42.019
Oh, shit.

1:14:42.102 --> 1:14:44.146
I wish I was
wearing your date shoes.

1:14:44.229 --> 1:14:46.148
Jibran, the lighter!
The cigarette lighter!

1:14:46.231 --> 1:14:48.358
That's what's it there for!
Go, go.

1:14:48.859 --> 1:14:50.777
-Yeah, you can do it.

1:14:54.865 --> 1:14:56.617
Okay, that's kind of hot.

1:14:58.702 --> 1:14:59.745
Does he see us?

1:14:59.828 --> 1:15:01.246
My God,
he's laying down plastic.

1:15:01.330 --> 1:15:02.331
Oh, shit, shit.

1:15:02.414 --> 1:15:03.916
-Has it popped out yet?
-No.

1:15:03.999 --> 1:15:06.210
- What about now?
-Okay. Okay.

1:15:06.502 --> 1:15:08.045
Come on. Hurry up.

1:15:08.670 --> 1:15:10.506
Get it, get it, get it.
Get it, get it, get it.

1:15:10.589 --> 1:15:12.549
- Close your eyes.
-Come on, come on.

1:15:13.258 --> 1:15:15.385
Get the plastic, not my hands!

1:15:20.807 --> 1:15:22.434
Drop it, drop it.
Ow! Ahh!

1:15:22.518 --> 1:15:24.603
-I had it in my mouth, okay?
-Yeah, but you didn't have

1:15:24.686 --> 1:15:26.230
-the hot end in your mouth.
-Hurry up!

1:15:27.356 --> 1:15:28.482
Hold, up, hold up,
he's looking at us.

1:15:28.565 --> 1:15:29.942
He's looking at us. Hold on.

1:15:31.318 --> 1:15:33.904
Okay, put it back.
Put it back. Put it back.

1:15:36.156 --> 1:15:37.491
Out of the car.

1:15:38.742 --> 1:15:41.537
They're gonna get you.
They know you drove us.

1:15:41.828 --> 1:15:43.830
No, they're
not gonna suspect me.

1:15:43.914 --> 1:15:45.707
When I drove you guys
to your apartment,

1:15:46.250 --> 1:15:48.252
the real killer
jumped out of the bushes

1:15:48.335 --> 1:15:49.836
and hit me over the head!

1:15:50.295 --> 1:15:52.130
When I woke up, there I was,

1:15:52.214 --> 1:15:54.091
tied up in the back
of my own squad car

1:15:54.174 --> 1:15:56.093
with you guys
here at the marina.

1:15:58.053 --> 1:15:59.221
Watch your step.

1:16:01.181 --> 1:16:04.017
And then the killer made us
get on the boat.

1:16:04.685 --> 1:16:06.478
That's right. All three of us.

1:16:06.770 --> 1:16:08.564
And you remember
what happened next.

1:16:09.189 --> 1:16:11.441
He made us all kneel down.
Go ahead.

1:16:13.068 --> 1:16:15.362
I jumped up
and tried to save you guys.

1:16:15.445 --> 1:16:17.656
And in the scuffle,
I was shot.

1:16:17.823 --> 1:16:20.450
I wasn't mortally wounded,
but I had to watch in horror

1:16:20.826 --> 1:16:22.578
as the masked killer

1:16:22.869 --> 1:16:25.038
executed you both with my gun.

1:16:25.122 --> 1:16:26.498
Anyway,
let's get this over with.

1:16:27.749 --> 1:16:28.917
Eenie...

1:16:29.334 --> 1:16:30.335
No.

1:16:30.627 --> 1:16:31.628
Eenie,

1:16:32.754 --> 1:16:34.089
meenie,

1:16:34.798 --> 1:16:35.799
miney...

1:16:45.809 --> 1:16:46.977
Hey, Mustache.

1:16:56.486 --> 1:16:57.779
Okay, okay.

1:16:59.948 --> 1:17:01.783
Oh, fuck.

1:17:02.034 --> 1:17:04.244
- Oh, no, no, no.
-Oh, shit.

1:17:04.661 --> 1:17:06.830
Go ahead. Shoot me.

1:17:07.831 --> 1:17:09.458
Right here in the shoulder
would be good.

1:17:09.541 --> 1:17:11.585
That way I don't
have to shoot myself.

1:17:11.835 --> 1:17:13.545
Drop the gun
or I'll break his neck.

1:17:13.795 --> 1:17:16.757
You can't break his neck.
It-It-It's too thick.

1:17:17.007 --> 1:17:20.010
I'll just twist until
something bad happens.

1:17:20.093 --> 1:17:21.178
From where I'm sitting,

1:17:21.261 --> 1:17:22.095
he's super convincing.

1:17:22.346 --> 1:17:23.555
He can't hurt you.

1:17:24.139 --> 1:17:26.308
I bet he can do it
quite easily.

1:17:26.892 --> 1:17:28.602
- Drop it.
-Leilani, listen to him.

1:17:28.685 --> 1:17:29.686
Put the gun down.

1:17:29.770 --> 1:17:30.771
You don't have a shot.

1:17:30.854 --> 1:17:32.105
-Just put it down.
-I do have a shot.

1:17:32.230 --> 1:17:34.232
Why are you arguing with me
about this?

1:17:34.316 --> 1:17:35.525
Because you think
you're always right,

1:17:35.609 --> 1:17:36.860
and you're wrong
about this, okay?

1:17:36.943 --> 1:17:38.445
I'm supposed to listen
to someone who's never

1:17:38.528 --> 1:17:40.238
held a gun before,
and I'm the know-it-all?

1:17:40.322 --> 1:17:41.615
-You refuse to take risks!
- Guys--

1:17:41.698 --> 1:17:42.616
This is a prime example.

1:17:42.699 --> 1:17:43.867
-You're the reason we're here!
-Guys--

1:17:43.950 --> 1:17:45.327
-This is your fault!
-Guys!

1:17:45.410 --> 1:17:46.662
Do you really wanna do this
right now?

1:17:46.745 --> 1:17:48.538
Oh, my God.
I wanted to go to the police!

1:17:48.789 --> 1:17:49.956
You were driving the car!

1:17:50.248 --> 1:17:51.708
I got kicked by a horse
for you!

1:17:51.792 --> 1:17:52.918
-Oh, my God.
- You just ran from

1:17:53.001 --> 1:17:54.544
-a dead body and left me.
-You guys are so annoying.

1:17:54.628 --> 1:17:56.088
I am alone
in this relationship.

1:17:56.171 --> 1:17:57.756
You watched my movie
without asking me!

1:17:57.964 --> 1:17:58.965
Nobody cares about your shit.

1:17:59.049 --> 1:18:00.133
Stop! You sound like
my parents!

1:18:00.217 --> 1:18:01.843
Understand what I'm doing
for once!

1:18:01.968 --> 1:18:03.011
Be with me on something!

1:18:03.095 --> 1:18:04.096
-One, two, three!
-Go!

1:18:06.723 --> 1:18:08.350
-shit.

1:18:09.518 --> 1:18:10.936
-Jibran, are you okay?
-Yeah.

1:18:11.019 --> 1:18:12.020
Oh, shit.

1:18:16.108 --> 1:18:17.067
Oh, my God.

1:18:49.349 --> 1:18:50.517
Thanks to you guys,

1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:53.019
we have the suspect
in custody. You're safe now.

1:19:00.736 --> 1:19:02.112
Sure you're okay?

1:19:02.195 --> 1:19:03.780
Yeah, I'm okay. Are you?

1:19:04.114 --> 1:19:05.115
Yeah.

1:19:06.199 --> 1:19:07.284
You know, I knew
you were gonna do that

1:19:07.367 --> 1:19:09.202
"one, two, three" thing,
even though it didn't work

1:19:09.286 --> 1:19:11.163
any other time.

1:19:11.246 --> 1:19:12.497
-You did everything.
-No, it was equal.

1:19:12.581 --> 1:19:13.582
-You did.
-It was equal!

1:19:13.790 --> 1:19:15.542
-You shot him!
-I know. Don't--

1:19:15.625 --> 1:19:17.586
-That was amazing.
-I would rather forget that.

1:19:17.669 --> 1:19:18.837
Don't ever shoot anyone
ever again.

1:19:18.920 --> 1:19:20.505
I will never shoot anyone
ever again.

1:19:23.341 --> 1:19:25.177
-What?
-I didn't say anything.

1:19:25.260 --> 1:19:26.386
I know that face.

1:19:27.137 --> 1:19:28.054
What face?

1:19:28.138 --> 1:19:29.598
It's the
"I wanna kiss you" face.

1:19:29.681 --> 1:19:31.391
-No, no. No, I don't--
-Yes, it is.

1:19:31.475 --> 1:19:32.809
-I don't wanna kiss you.
-Oh.

1:19:33.310 --> 1:19:35.937
I don't, so--
You're very arrogant. Gross.

1:19:36.021 --> 1:19:37.314
Oh, gross?

1:19:37.397 --> 1:19:39.691
Wow, you wanna kiss me so bad,

1:19:39.775 --> 1:19:41.568
like, with tongue
and everything. I can tell.

1:19:41.651 --> 1:19:42.778
You are projecting.

1:19:42.861 --> 1:19:44.529
-Oh, okay.
-I think you wanna kiss me.

1:19:44.613 --> 1:19:46.281
-I wanna kiss you?
-You wanna kiss me.

1:19:46.364 --> 1:19:47.949
And you're, like,
doing this now.

1:19:48.158 --> 1:19:49.910
Doing what? What am I doing?

1:20:01.713 --> 1:20:03.256
Sorry to interrupt, lovebirds.

1:20:03.465 --> 1:20:04.591
I gotta take you
to the hospital,

1:20:04.674 --> 1:20:06.760
have them check you out.
It's protocol.

1:20:10.972 --> 1:20:13.475
Back-of-the-ambulance sex
is pretty freaky, right?

1:20:14.142 --> 1:20:16.520
-I am so down.
-All right, let's go.

1:20:17.437 --> 1:20:18.438
Are you gonna
try that move

1:20:18.522 --> 1:20:19.356
we saw in the orgy?

1:20:19.439 --> 1:20:21.191
Oh, I'm gonna
put in some work!

1:20:21.274 --> 1:20:22.609
Mmm-mmm,
you don't sound right.

1:20:22.692 --> 1:20:23.944
That's my line.

1:20:32.619 --> 1:20:34.246
- <i>Run, Leilani!</i>
- <i>Jibran, I'm running.</i>

1:20:34.454 --> 1:20:35.580
<i>Holy shit, holy shit!</i>

1:20:35.664 --> 1:20:36.498
<i>They're right behind us!</i>

1:20:36.665 --> 1:20:38.083
Let me lead. Let me get
in front, slow down!

1:20:38.250 --> 1:20:39.876
-Run, run, run!
-Jibran, I'm running.

1:20:39.960 --> 1:20:41.545
Don't tell me to run
when I'm already running!

1:20:41.628 --> 1:20:43.797
Oh, my God, they're
right there! We're so fucked!

1:20:45.257 --> 1:20:47.217
<i>This is London, England.</i>

1:20:47.300 --> 1:20:49.469
<i>Jibran and Leilani</i>
<i>lost valuable time</i>

1:20:49.553 --> 1:20:52.138
<i>after a heated argument</i>
<i>about the metric system.</i>

1:20:52.305 --> 1:20:54.432
<i>With only two legs remaining,</i>

1:20:54.516 --> 1:20:57.644
<i>do they have what it takes</i>
<i>to win the $1 million prize?</i>

1:20:57.936 --> 1:20:59.396
We're actually doing it,
Jibran!

1:20:59.479 --> 1:21:01.356
I told you we could win
<i>The Amazing Race.</i>

1:21:04.401 --> 1:21:05.986
Okay. "For over 50 years,

1:21:06.069 --> 1:21:09.072
enthusiasts have gathered at
Hyde Park to commemorate--"

1:21:10.407 --> 1:21:11.700
-Uh-oh.
-What?

1:21:17.414 --> 1:21:18.832
Oh, .
