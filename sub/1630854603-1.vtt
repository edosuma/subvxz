WEBVTT

00:21.456 --> 00:23.066
And we're back.

00:23.153 --> 00:24.633
We're talking to professor
of water chemistry,

00:24.720 --> 00:26.374
Dr. Jennifer Ashgrove,

00:26.504 --> 00:28.506
one of the many scientists
around the world

00:28.637 --> 00:31.770
trying to find a solution
to the water pandemic.

00:31.901 --> 00:35.339
Dr. Ashgrove, we know it's too
late now to create a vaccine

00:35.470 --> 00:38.516
now that the entire world
is infected with this virus.

00:38.647 --> 00:39.909
But can you explain to me

00:39.996 --> 00:43.086
what exactly are you and
your team working on?

00:45.871 --> 00:47.090
As we all know,

00:47.177 --> 00:48.570
this virus feeds on oxygen molecules

00:48.700 --> 00:49.571
in the water that we drink,

00:49.701 --> 00:51.007
making water consumption toxic

00:51.138 --> 00:53.966
and unfortunately, eventually fatal.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.752
So essentially, my team
and I are looking for ways

00:56.882 --> 00:58.754
to bond the oxygen
molecules more securely

00:58.841 --> 01:01.104
to the hydrogen molecules
in the water we drink

01:01.191 --> 01:05.239
so the virus will starve and
eventually, hopefully die.

01:06.936 --> 01:08.024
You know, this time in history

01:08.155 --> 01:10.200
has been nicknamed the great paradox.

01:10.331 --> 01:12.420
We obviously need water to survive,

01:12.550 --> 01:14.987
but now if we drink too
little, we'd dehydrate.

01:15.075 --> 01:17.338
We drink too much and the
toxicity builds up in us

01:17.425 --> 01:18.730
and it can kill us.

01:18.817 --> 01:19.688
Well, it really comes down to

01:19.818 --> 01:20.906
self-regulation here.

01:21.037 --> 01:22.430
The death rates are astounding,

01:22.560 --> 01:24.301
but they would slow
down if people carefully

01:24.388 --> 01:25.998
rationed their water intake.

01:26.086 --> 01:30.090
But you know,
obviously relying on individuals

01:30.177 --> 01:32.048
to change their
behaviors, often enough.

01:32.179 --> 01:34.006
I mean, the numbers, as you
mentioned are astounding.

01:34.094 --> 01:37.358
That's 60 million people
around the world have died

01:37.445 --> 01:39.621
and the rest of the
population is now expected

01:39.751 --> 01:41.927
to perish within five years.

01:42.014 --> 01:44.408
Well, I know a lot of people are looking

01:44.539 --> 01:46.889
to you specifically to
help get us out of this.

01:47.019 --> 01:50.022
I saw that the UK Science
Journal reported last week,

01:50.110 --> 01:53.025
that of all the teams around the world,

01:53.113 --> 01:55.115
you might be the closest
to a breakthrough.

01:55.202 --> 01:56.464
That is flattering

01:56.594 --> 01:58.814
but I can't really comment on that now

01:58.944 --> 02:00.598
but I can promise you

02:00.729 --> 02:02.818
that I haven't taken a single
day away from this work

02:02.948 --> 02:05.125
since the outbreak started and won't.

02:06.430 --> 02:07.736
I know that you're married.

02:07.823 --> 02:09.433
And I imagine working a job like this

02:09.520 --> 02:13.220
that has such a demand
on you every single day,

02:13.350 --> 02:14.699
what kind of toll does that take?

02:16.397 --> 02:19.661
- Uh, yes, well, it's
all about balance

02:19.791 --> 02:20.705
and I think...

02:23.882 --> 02:25.362
In this situation, you make it work.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.147
You just, you find a way.

02:28.365 --> 02:29.758
We're doing okay.

02:52.868 --> 02:54.261
Oh my God.

02:54.391 --> 02:55.610
- Jenn?

02:57.873 --> 02:59.440
- I gotta go.

03:12.061 --> 03:12.888
Fuck, Frank, pick up.

03:14.672 --> 03:15.934
This is Frank, leave a message.

03:16.065 --> 03:16.674
- Frank!

03:18.067 --> 03:19.895
Frank, Frank, I figured it out.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.028
Get the team together

03:23.115 --> 03:25.379
and meet me at the office in 45 minutes.

03:27.119 --> 03:28.251
I figured it out, Frank, I-

03:30.862 --> 03:32.647
Fuck, I figured it out.

04:00.022 --> 04:00.718
- Hey.

04:02.851 --> 04:04.026
- Hi.

04:04.113 --> 04:05.245
How you doing?

04:05.332 --> 04:06.071
- Hmm.

04:08.073 --> 04:09.901
A little groggy.
- Yeah.

04:11.903 --> 04:12.991
- Oh, I'm sorry.

04:13.078 --> 04:14.950
No, don't be sorry.

04:15.080 --> 04:17.257
- I know, I slept a long time.

04:20.085 --> 04:21.391
- Hi, I'm Dr. Lakeland.

04:23.306 --> 04:25.917
Yeah, so you feeling okay, Jennifer?

04:29.747 --> 04:30.661
- Yes.
- Okay.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.185
- So.
- Sorry, this is-

04:33.316 --> 04:34.578
- I know, I know, I'm so sorry

04:34.709 --> 04:35.971
to sort of surprise you
like that, I'm sorry.

04:36.101 --> 04:37.799
- Hmm hmm.
- I'm sorry.

04:37.886 --> 04:39.409
But I just wanted to make
sure that I could talk to you

04:39.540 --> 04:40.671
when you woke up.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.151
We've determined that you're suffering

04:42.238 --> 04:44.284
from a bit of a dissociative amnesia,

04:44.371 --> 04:46.938
which just means things, you know,

04:47.025 --> 04:48.853
before you collapse might
be a little bit fuzzy.

04:48.940 --> 04:49.898
That's okay.

04:49.985 --> 04:51.378
And that's normal, guys.

04:51.465 --> 04:52.030
So I don't want you to worry about that.

04:52.117 --> 04:53.075
- Okay-
- Some things.

04:53.162 --> 04:54.555
It's no problem.

04:54.685 --> 04:56.034
When you collapsed,

04:56.165 --> 04:57.819
do you know how much water
you'd consume that day?

05:00.256 --> 05:02.606
- It was, uh,
directly after lunch.

05:02.693 --> 05:04.869
So, 25.

05:04.956 --> 05:06.306
- Okay, great.

05:06.393 --> 05:08.525
So we can rule out any toxicity.

05:08.612 --> 05:10.875
Jennifer, I understand you
have a bit of a history

05:11.006 --> 05:13.008
of having these like
stress-induced blackouts.

05:13.138 --> 05:14.705
Is that correct?

05:14.792 --> 05:15.489
- Umm.

05:17.099 --> 05:18.840
Well, no, I don't think,

05:18.970 --> 05:22.365
a bit of a history, is a correct way to.

05:22.452 --> 05:24.976
Well, I've had, there's
been several times

05:25.063 --> 05:28.153
that I've lost time for a moment,

05:28.284 --> 05:30.547
but it's,

05:30.634 --> 05:33.289
it doesn't happen every
day is what I'm saying.

05:33.420 --> 05:35.944
- Okay and have you ever
been hospitalized with those?

05:36.031 --> 05:37.380
- No, no, no.

05:42.429 --> 05:46.041
I have, I was in the hospital
last year for four days.

05:47.129 --> 05:50.524
We had a miscarriage and so I,

05:52.308 --> 05:54.136
it has nothing to do with the blackouts.

05:54.223 --> 05:55.006
This was more...

05:58.053 --> 05:59.576
Personal.
- Okay.

06:00.664 --> 06:02.274
Well, since you have

06:02.362 --> 06:04.799
what I would consider a medical history

06:04.886 --> 06:06.278
with these blackouts

06:06.366 --> 06:10.326
and because I know that
you're under very extreme,

06:10.457 --> 06:12.981
like unimaginable stress right now,

06:13.068 --> 06:14.765
I think that what's going
to be really great for you

06:14.852 --> 06:17.072
is if you take a
little bit of time off,

06:17.202 --> 06:19.814
if you have a little bit of a
rest, just a couple of days.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.250
I think that's going to be great for you

06:21.337 --> 06:22.947
and ultimately, great for everybody else.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.517
- You understand what
I do for a living?

06:27.648 --> 06:29.214
Correct?
- Yeah.

06:29.301 --> 06:31.869
- Well, then you realize
that it's not possible for me

06:31.956 --> 06:33.175
to take any sort of break.

06:33.262 --> 06:35.873
I feel great right now.

06:36.004 --> 06:37.440
- Well, so, okay.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.702
So here's the thing.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.400
Because of the stress you're under

06:40.487 --> 06:41.575
and because you do have this history,

06:41.662 --> 06:44.665
my concern would be that
these blackouts reoccur.

06:44.795 --> 06:46.144
So I think what's going
to be great for you

06:46.275 --> 06:49.278
and it's going to ultimately
help you do your job,

06:49.365 --> 06:51.193
is if we can reset your system a bit.

06:51.323 --> 06:52.499
I'm just talking about a weekend.

06:52.629 --> 06:53.891
You know-
- Okay.

06:53.978 --> 06:55.153
- I'm not saying
take a month off.

06:55.284 --> 06:56.285
Just like a couple of days.
- Okay.

06:56.372 --> 06:57.721
- Is there somewhere
maybe you could go

06:57.852 --> 07:00.071
where you could just relax,
get away from everything?

07:02.247 --> 07:03.335
- Yeah. Yeah.

07:03.466 --> 07:05.990
We have a farm, her family farm.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.993
- Yeah.

07:09.080 --> 07:09.777
- That sounds great.

07:17.393 --> 07:19.961
- You're not
supposed to be here.

07:21.484 --> 07:22.616
- Good morning, Frank.

07:23.660 --> 07:25.096
Just saving the world.

07:25.227 --> 07:26.141
I'll be out in 15 minutes.

07:26.271 --> 07:27.447
- Goddammit, Jennifer.

07:27.534 --> 07:28.099
- Don't goddammit, me.

07:28.230 --> 07:29.274
I'm not even here.

07:29.361 --> 07:30.928
- We have had this conversation.

07:31.059 --> 07:32.452
- Look away.

07:32.582 --> 07:33.714
- You just had a blackout.
- Why are following me?

07:33.844 --> 07:36.281
- You had a blackout
a month ago.

07:36.368 --> 07:37.631
I can't use you like this.

07:37.718 --> 07:40.024
Doctor's orders, you need to rest.

07:40.111 --> 07:41.722
- I'm not resting.

07:41.809 --> 07:43.245
I'm going to head upstairs to my office.

07:43.332 --> 07:44.899
You will barely notice me.

07:44.986 --> 07:46.901
And then, we can get back to work.

07:46.988 --> 07:48.511
- Why don't you go to that
place you got in the country

07:48.598 --> 07:49.730
with your husband?

07:49.860 --> 07:51.209
- Sure.

07:51.340 --> 07:52.820
Every day, a hundred thousand people die

07:52.950 --> 07:54.909
but I'm going to go, head
up and have a vacation.

07:54.996 --> 07:58.434
- Green team is still working
on your new toxicity formula.

07:58.565 --> 08:02.046
Geneva needs two days to send
them the bacteria results.

08:02.133 --> 08:03.134
You've got the time.

08:04.440 --> 08:06.398
- Who's going to run
point man when I'm gone?

08:06.529 --> 08:08.139
For two days, who's going to take over?

08:11.273 --> 08:12.361
- This isn't a request.

08:14.015 --> 08:15.233
If you're still here in 10
minutes, I'm calling the MPs,

08:15.320 --> 08:16.539
have you sent home.

08:16.670 --> 08:17.497
- You gotta be
kidding me, Frank.

08:17.584 --> 08:18.193
- Nine minutes, 58 seconds.

08:18.323 --> 08:19.324
- Frank!

08:20.369 --> 08:21.152
Frank!

08:22.937 --> 08:23.677
Sorry.

08:25.461 --> 08:26.549
- Who is gonna run point man?

08:28.333 --> 08:29.204
- Did I say point man?

08:29.334 --> 08:30.292
I meant point woman.

08:30.379 --> 08:31.380
- That makes it better?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.425
- Well point person.
- All right.

08:33.513 --> 08:35.602
- Point people, if we could
have multiple people running.

08:35.689 --> 08:38.213
Quit while
you're ahead, man, Jesus.

08:38.343 --> 08:39.388
- Okay, fill me in.

08:40.345 --> 08:42.043
- Bacteria patterning.

08:42.173 --> 08:43.784
You know what Snowmax is?

08:43.871 --> 08:46.438
It's the fake snow on ski hills.

08:46.569 --> 08:49.137
It's made using the bacteria,
pseudomonas syringae.

08:49.224 --> 08:50.486
- Yeah.

08:50.617 --> 08:51.835
- Bacteria is amazing
ice nuclear, right?

08:51.966 --> 08:52.619
You know that.

08:52.749 --> 08:54.185
So you take bacteria.

08:54.272 --> 08:55.404
And when it's in ice form,

08:55.491 --> 08:58.363
the molecules are more
firmly bound together

08:58.450 --> 09:00.409
so the virus would have a
hard time ripping it apart.

09:00.496 --> 09:02.411
So what we need to do is
come up with a pre-ice.

09:02.498 --> 09:03.847
- And it could still
possibly be digested?

09:03.978 --> 09:06.154
- I don't know, find out.

09:06.241 --> 09:07.329
I'll do some modeling over the weekend

09:07.416 --> 09:10.419
while you go away to the farm

09:10.506 --> 09:12.116
and then we can deal with it-
- Elliot.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.511
Enough.

09:15.642 --> 09:18.427
What is your obsession
with a farm, you people.

09:18.514 --> 09:20.385
- It's not an obsession
with the farm, Jennifer.

09:20.472 --> 09:22.039
You need some time to relax.

09:22.126 --> 09:24.215
You need some time to just
get away from this, okay?

09:24.302 --> 09:26.087
I promise you, if you
go away for the weekend,

09:26.174 --> 09:27.741
I'll do this work.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.394
We'll revisit it Monday morning

09:29.481 --> 09:30.700
and I'll have some answers for you.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.616
Look, you're stuck.

09:33.703 --> 09:35.618
You need to stop thinking
about it for a couple of days.

09:35.705 --> 09:37.751
And I don't know, maybe the
solution will come to you.

09:37.838 --> 09:38.578
- Fine.

09:42.059 --> 09:45.628
But if I'm going to the
farm, you're coming with me.

09:45.715 --> 09:46.890
- I'm not going to the farm.

09:47.021 --> 09:47.804
I'm gonna stay here.
- Yes, you are.

09:47.891 --> 09:49.023
Just listen to me, please.

09:49.153 --> 09:49.937
You and Sam can

09:52.026 --> 09:53.549
come up for dinner.

09:53.636 --> 09:55.333
I can't do this alone.

09:55.464 --> 09:56.987
And I can't sit up there
at that farm without you.

09:57.074 --> 09:57.901
- Yup.

09:58.032 --> 09:59.076
We'll go.
- Yeah?

09:59.207 --> 10:00.164
- Hmm hmm.

10:00.251 --> 10:02.253
- And we will relax.

10:02.384 --> 10:04.604
And Jason will make

10:06.040 --> 10:07.694
a Colombian dish.

10:07.824 --> 10:10.479
Colombian?

10:10.566 --> 10:12.524
- Yep, he's going to make
a delicious Colombian-

10:12.655 --> 10:14.483
- Oh, goddamnit, that's good.

10:14.570 --> 10:17.268
Yes, get him to make a
Colombian meal for me and-

10:17.355 --> 10:18.574
- It's going to be wonderful.

10:18.705 --> 10:19.706
And you're going to regret saying that.

10:19.836 --> 10:21.403
And it's going to be a wonderful weekend.

10:21.533 --> 10:23.666
- Hmm hmm, what are you
going to do up there,

10:23.753 --> 10:25.233
over the weekend?

10:25.320 --> 10:26.713
- I don't know.

10:26.800 --> 10:28.584
I'm going to do whatever I
need to do to let you guys know

10:28.715 --> 10:31.282
that I am okay and to get you off my back.

10:31.413 --> 10:33.415
I will be relaxed.

10:33.502 --> 10:34.329
I'm going to have fun

10:35.417 --> 10:36.157
at the farm.

11:41.309 --> 11:42.571
It's nice there.

14:33.916 --> 14:37.572
- Um, I moved all your
stuff into the drawers,

14:37.702 --> 14:39.182
the two top drawers.

14:39.313 --> 14:41.706
But I see that you've
moved everything around

14:41.793 --> 14:42.664
that used to be there.

14:42.751 --> 14:44.753
Yeah.

14:47.495 --> 14:48.235
- Thank you.

14:49.366 --> 14:50.063
For?

14:51.629 --> 14:53.675
- You've done a lot of
work around the house

14:53.762 --> 14:55.590
and have taken care of it.

14:56.983 --> 14:57.766
- You're welcome.
- It's good.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.855
You've done a lot.

14:59.986 --> 15:02.423
- Yeah, no, it's
keeping me busy.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.990
It's good.

15:04.120 --> 15:05.817
Yeah, I mean, you know,

15:05.905 --> 15:10.257
if you want anything moved
back, just let me know.

15:11.867 --> 15:12.781
- No, I don't want
anything moved back.

15:14.391 --> 15:18.091
Um, also you play the ukulele.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.660
- Very observant.

15:22.791 --> 15:25.533
When did you?

15:25.620 --> 15:28.623
Why and when?

15:28.753 --> 15:30.277
- Uh.
- But mostly why.

15:32.061 --> 15:36.631
- Uh, I did it in, I
picked it up last March.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.503
And I just been working on it.

15:39.634 --> 15:41.766
I don't know, it's been
a good thing for me.

15:41.853 --> 15:44.682
It keeps me company on
those lonely nights.

15:46.554 --> 15:47.598
- Nice.

15:52.386 --> 15:53.430
Listen, I,

15:55.780 --> 15:58.827
I don't want to do this,

15:58.958 --> 16:00.176
this weekend,

16:00.307 --> 16:01.177
of just,

16:02.483 --> 16:04.180
just a little,

16:04.267 --> 16:07.009
it keeps me company digs and I don't,

16:07.096 --> 16:09.142
I just, I don't want to
do that this weekend.

16:10.795 --> 16:12.710
- Why are you pissed
off at me right now?

16:12.841 --> 16:15.670
- It's just, Jason, I love
the fact that you learned

16:15.800 --> 16:18.890
a completely, random instrument

16:19.021 --> 16:20.283
with all of the time that you have off.

16:20.414 --> 16:21.589
It has nothing to do with that.

16:21.676 --> 16:22.894
- So then what are
you pissed off about?

16:23.025 --> 16:25.854
- I just don't need
you to use it as a tool

16:25.941 --> 16:30.641
to remind me of how alone
you feel or are, or I just-

16:31.555 --> 16:32.687
Listen, I love it.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.123
I think it's great.

16:34.254 --> 16:35.864
I am glad that you found
something to do with your time

16:35.951 --> 16:38.171
besides moving stuff around the house.

16:41.783 --> 16:42.740
- Let's make lunch.

16:42.827 --> 16:43.524
Let's make lunch.

16:44.655 --> 16:46.483
And I'm fucking thirsty.

16:46.614 --> 16:47.702
I'm ready for a sip, you?

16:48.659 --> 16:49.747
Come.

16:51.575 --> 16:52.881
Let's eat.

16:55.492 --> 16:56.580
Uh, are we
doing doing sandwiches?

16:56.667 --> 16:57.364
- Yeah.

16:58.756 --> 17:00.889
All right.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.023
I'm thinking maybe we could

17:04.849 --> 17:07.591
make some rules,

17:07.722 --> 17:08.636
rules for the weekend.

17:08.723 --> 17:09.419
I'll lay down some,

17:11.378 --> 17:12.379
I'm going to commit to,

17:14.120 --> 17:15.512
I'm not gonna make,

17:15.599 --> 17:17.427
I'm not going to do any
more passive aggressive

17:19.516 --> 17:22.258
shitty things for your
acknowledgement or attention.

17:22.389 --> 17:24.043
I won't.

17:24.173 --> 17:26.175
That is my promise to you
for the weekend, okay?

17:26.306 --> 17:27.046
Well, hopefully, forever,

17:27.133 --> 17:28.699
but definitely for the weekend.

17:30.701 --> 17:32.051
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

17:32.138 --> 17:33.791
Well then, if you're doing that,

17:33.878 --> 17:35.750
I am going

17:36.577 --> 17:39.058
to be present.

17:40.842 --> 17:42.670
The whole time, here.

17:42.757 --> 17:43.758
- Yeah?

17:45.107 --> 17:45.890
That'd be great.

17:46.891 --> 17:47.631
- Okay.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.766
- I promise no more
wisecracks about you

17:52.984 --> 17:55.248
being off, saving the planet

17:55.378 --> 17:58.599
while I'm stuck at home with my ukulele.

18:01.515 --> 18:02.820
- Is it a ukulele
or is it a banjo?

18:02.907 --> 18:04.083
- You know, it's a ukulele.

18:06.694 --> 18:07.651
- Well then, uh,

18:09.392 --> 18:10.741
it looks like it's going
to be a nice weekend.

18:12.265 --> 18:14.180
I'm not going to have a sandwich anymore.

18:14.310 --> 18:15.137
I don't really feel like one.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.573
I'm just gonna eat a salad.

18:16.660 --> 18:18.880
- Ah, I think you,
why, are you sure?

18:18.967 --> 18:20.882
- Yeah.

18:20.969 --> 18:22.101
- Let me make you this sandwich.

18:22.231 --> 18:25.016
I really feel like
you're going to like it.

18:25.104 --> 18:27.367
I've been working on my
sandwich-making abilities

18:27.454 --> 18:29.369
and it's going to be
the best turkey sandwich

18:29.499 --> 18:30.152
you've ever had.

18:30.239 --> 18:31.501
- I'm sure it is.

18:31.588 --> 18:33.112
I just, honestly, I just want a salad.

18:36.854 --> 18:37.464
- All right, look.

18:39.727 --> 18:40.771
This is silly, but,

18:42.556 --> 18:43.209
I baked the bread.

18:43.339 --> 18:44.340
I baked the bread and

18:45.776 --> 18:46.429
when I baked it,

18:46.560 --> 18:47.169
I imagined us,

18:48.997 --> 18:50.955
eating the sandwiches together.

18:51.042 --> 18:54.524
That's stupid and it's weird
and sentimental and dumb.

18:54.611 --> 18:57.092
If you wanna have a salad, I get it.

18:57.179 --> 18:59.747
Have a salad.

19:02.532 --> 19:03.229
- Yes. Fine.

19:03.359 --> 19:04.752
Yes, thank you.

19:04.839 --> 19:05.840
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

19:05.970 --> 19:06.710
I just, I'd love one.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.800
- Okay.

19:09.887 --> 19:12.673
Would you join me in
trading five ounces of water

19:14.109 --> 19:15.676
for a three ounce glass
of wine for lunch?

19:18.592 --> 19:19.332
- Yes.

19:20.289 --> 19:20.942
Yes.

19:21.029 --> 19:22.030
- Okay.

19:22.161 --> 19:23.336
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

19:24.598 --> 19:25.642
- I'm at 25.

19:28.167 --> 19:30.430
- Wanna go and pick a bottle?

19:30.517 --> 19:31.474
- Yeah.

19:31.605 --> 19:32.214
Are you okay?

19:33.998 --> 19:35.565
- I'm good.

19:35.696 --> 19:36.349
- Are you okay?

19:40.657 --> 19:41.354
- Yes.

19:43.007 --> 19:43.704
- Okay.

19:47.011 --> 19:47.708
- Red or white?

19:49.013 --> 19:49.710
- White.

19:53.366 --> 19:56.064
Fuck me.

19:59.633 --> 20:01.678
- Potatoes, I dug
those up already.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.506
Do you remember the scallop potatoes

20:03.637 --> 20:05.073
I made with the veal chop?
- Yeah.

20:05.204 --> 20:06.770
- Yeah, that was those.

20:06.901 --> 20:09.077
Asparagus went to seed like, months ago.

20:09.208 --> 20:11.035
So that's done.

20:11.122 --> 20:12.385
- You've done a lot of work.

20:13.647 --> 20:15.692
It's really good.
- Thanks.

20:15.779 --> 20:17.912
Yeah, and I'm getting good at it.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.653
Thumb's turning green.

20:19.740 --> 20:20.567
- Let me see?

20:20.697 --> 20:21.263
- I should probably get that.

20:21.350 --> 20:23.004
Looked at.

20:23.134 --> 20:25.049
- I'll grab the far end.
- Okay.

20:25.180 --> 20:25.876
You good?

20:27.095 --> 20:29.140
Ready and lift.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.362
- You okay?
- Yep.

20:40.195 --> 20:41.979
You have weight, no, no.

20:42.110 --> 20:43.329
Just paddle on the right.

20:43.459 --> 20:45.853
Paddle on the right.
- Oh, Jesus Christ.

20:45.983 --> 20:47.420
- You want me to help?

20:47.507 --> 20:50.031
Are you trying to turn
this perpendicular?

20:50.118 --> 20:51.511
What are you doing?

20:51.598 --> 20:54.122
You tell me if you see a
rock, so we can avoid it.

20:54.253 --> 20:55.254
- You know what?
- Yep.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.733
- Here's my guess.
- Yeah.

20:56.820 --> 20:58.257
- There's rocks
fucking everywhere.

21:00.607 --> 21:01.869
Are we going forwards or backwards?

21:01.956 --> 21:03.131
South.

21:03.262 --> 21:04.959
- Which way is South?

21:05.089 --> 21:06.221
I don't know.

21:06.308 --> 21:08.354
So relaxing.

21:08.484 --> 21:09.572
Fuck.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.052
- How are you doing back there?

21:11.139 --> 21:12.575
- I'm doing great, just amazing.

21:12.706 --> 21:14.447
It's been enlightening.

21:18.929 --> 21:22.063
It's pretty.

21:22.193 --> 21:24.108
- Wish it could tell
me what it's thinking.

21:28.069 --> 21:29.331
We should do this more often.

21:56.793 --> 21:58.926
Oh.

22:11.721 --> 22:13.288
Oh my God.

22:13.375 --> 22:14.028
- Fuck.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.598
Fuck.

22:18.685 --> 22:19.903
- How much did you have left?

22:21.992 --> 22:22.863
- I don't know.

22:23.994 --> 22:25.169
I don't know.

22:33.003 --> 22:33.830
Fuck.

22:36.137 --> 22:37.094
What are you doing?

22:37.225 --> 22:39.053
Stop.
- Hey, hey, hey.

22:39.183 --> 22:40.446
I'll follow you.

22:52.980 --> 22:54.373
- I'm sorry.

23:00.074 --> 23:01.075
You know, I feel like a bit,

23:01.205 --> 23:02.076
no, a lot of a

23:04.687 --> 23:06.428
shit person,

23:06.515 --> 23:09.083
because I haven't asked you
anything about your book.

23:10.432 --> 23:11.390
Like anything.

23:12.739 --> 23:15.045
The whole year has been about me and,

23:17.787 --> 23:18.571
I'm sorry.

23:18.658 --> 23:20.050
- No, it's fine.

23:20.137 --> 23:21.443
I don't want to talk about work.

23:21.530 --> 23:22.923
We promised we weren't
going to talk about work.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.273
- But I wanna know
about your work.

23:26.622 --> 23:28.972
- Yeah, but we made a rule and,

23:29.103 --> 23:32.149
can't break a rule.

23:32.280 --> 23:32.976
- What do you want
to talk about, then?

23:33.063 --> 23:33.542
- I don't.

23:35.326 --> 23:35.979
I'm trying to write something.

23:36.066 --> 23:36.937
What do you think?

23:37.067 --> 23:38.286
- You want to write something?

23:38.373 --> 23:39.330
- No, I'm trying
to, I've got the.

23:47.730 --> 23:49.340
- Did you write that?

23:49.471 --> 23:50.254
- Yeah.
- No, you didn't.

23:50.341 --> 23:51.734
- It took me three months.

24:02.049 --> 24:02.876
- Is it finished?

24:03.006 --> 24:04.355
- No.

24:04.486 --> 24:06.314
No, I'd like to put words in.

24:09.665 --> 24:13.277
I would never, I tried and I'm shit.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.627
So I'll just go silly like.

24:14.714 --> 24:15.976
- Just make something up.

24:46.049 --> 24:47.050
I do.

25:03.676 --> 25:04.372
- Nice!

25:17.167 --> 25:18.125
I think it's a hit.

25:18.212 --> 25:18.995
I think it's amazing.

25:19.126 --> 25:20.519
- Yeah, you got a winner there?

25:20.606 --> 25:21.215
- Hmm hmm.

26:44.254 --> 26:44.994
I hate you!

26:46.126 --> 26:48.302
You betrayed me first!

26:50.130 --> 26:51.087
- What is it?

26:51.218 --> 26:52.828
You okay?

26:52.915 --> 26:53.612
You okay?

26:54.917 --> 26:55.657
What was it?

26:55.744 --> 26:56.615
What was it?

26:58.442 --> 26:59.356
- Uh.
- Do you remember?

27:05.232 --> 27:07.364
- No.
- Okay, okay.

27:07.451 --> 27:09.062
Go back to sleep.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.194
Shh, come on.

27:11.281 --> 27:12.239
- I'm sorry.

27:12.369 --> 27:14.023
- No, it's okay, come.

27:16.243 --> 27:17.461
- I'm okay.

27:17.592 --> 27:18.854
- It's all right, it's okay.

27:18.941 --> 27:19.638
Come here.

27:26.427 --> 27:28.864
It's okay, go back to sleep.

29:06.788 --> 29:08.703
Hey, you wanna
go to the farmer's market?

29:08.834 --> 29:10.923
I would love to
go to the farmer's market.

29:16.189 --> 29:18.539
Can I get the yellow beans?

29:18.626 --> 29:21.324
A dozen corn.

29:21.455 --> 29:23.022
Can we get a basket of the mixed peppers?

29:23.152 --> 29:23.762
Sure.

29:26.808 --> 29:28.462
- And pork belly.
- Pork.

29:28.592 --> 29:29.376
Yeah, sure.

29:29.463 --> 29:31.073
Hi.

29:31.160 --> 29:31.508
Can we get a
bag of the honey crisp?

29:31.639 --> 29:32.988
You give me the stuff.

29:33.075 --> 29:35.425
You go grab the apple crumbled pie.

29:35.512 --> 29:37.036
I'll meet you back at the car.

29:37.123 --> 29:39.690
As usual, do you
have any apple crumbled pie?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.388
Oh no, I don't have those today.

29:41.475 --> 29:44.130
But we have the apple cake
here, that's very nice.

29:45.871 --> 29:47.786
- So Hans didn't have any
more apple crumble, but,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.092
he gave me strawberry rhubarb.

29:50.223 --> 29:51.659
His last one, he sends his apologies.

29:51.790 --> 29:52.660
- Oh, okay.

29:55.358 --> 29:56.446
Uh.

29:57.534 --> 29:58.579
Are you sure he didn't have any?

29:58.666 --> 29:59.362
- Yeah.

30:00.668 --> 30:02.235
He was very upset for you.

30:02.322 --> 30:02.975
- Uh.

30:04.890 --> 30:07.762
Sometimes, he has some in the back.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.416
- He didn't, he had,
he didn't have any.

30:09.503 --> 30:10.025
- You know what?

30:12.811 --> 30:14.638
Humor me, I'm
gonna double-check.

30:14.725 --> 30:15.683
- You don't have
to double check.

30:15.770 --> 30:17.076
- I'll be one sec,
I'll be one sec.

30:17.163 --> 30:17.816
- Jason, he didn't have-
- I'll be right back.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.433
Hey...

30:39.663 --> 30:40.403
Got it.

30:42.231 --> 30:43.319
- How did you get it?
- He always does that.

30:43.406 --> 30:44.277
- He's losing it, man.

30:44.364 --> 30:45.017
He's losing it.

30:47.019 --> 30:48.716
Let's go.
- He checked in the back.

30:52.372 --> 30:52.851
He lied to me.

32:26.248 --> 32:26.945
- It's not easy.

32:30.426 --> 32:31.123
I'm trying.

32:33.125 --> 32:34.213
Yeah.

32:38.869 --> 32:39.566
You think I don't know that?

32:41.611 --> 32:43.396
Yeah, okay, I will.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.617
Yeah, she's in the hammock.

32:49.576 --> 32:50.490
Alright.

32:52.796 --> 32:54.407
Okay, bye.

33:09.596 --> 33:11.250
Fuck.

33:29.355 --> 33:30.051
Jenn?

33:31.400 --> 33:32.880
- Hey.
- Hey, where are you?

33:35.709 --> 33:36.666
- Right here.

33:36.753 --> 33:37.928
Oh.

33:38.059 --> 33:39.582
Hey, what are you, what's going on?

33:39.669 --> 33:42.498
- Oh, I'm just uh,

33:42.585 --> 33:44.674
putting some things together
to give to Sam and Elliot,

33:44.805 --> 33:46.067
tonight, just for the baby.

33:52.204 --> 33:53.031
Uh?

33:54.249 --> 33:55.772
- For the baby,
you're gonna give,

33:55.903 --> 33:58.427
you're gonna give them your bassinet?

33:58.558 --> 34:00.603
- Yeah, I just wanted to
give them a couple of things

34:00.690 --> 34:02.127
for the baby.

34:02.257 --> 34:05.304
It's like an early surprise baby present.

34:05.391 --> 34:06.000
I thought it'd be nice.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.219
Just at dinner tonight.

34:08.698 --> 34:10.526
- Well-

34:10.613 --> 34:12.615
- I don't wanna give them
any sort of the artificial,

34:12.746 --> 34:15.966
weird sterile crap that
they have in their registry.

34:16.054 --> 34:17.098
I just want to give
them something personal.

34:17.185 --> 34:18.360
I thought it would be nice.

34:18.491 --> 34:21.146
And I think it's just a nice gesture

34:21.233 --> 34:23.626
to give them something
that means something to us.

34:24.627 --> 34:25.715
Well, me.

34:25.846 --> 34:26.629
- No, us.

34:26.716 --> 34:28.066
No, no, us.

34:28.153 --> 34:28.936
It means something to us.

34:29.067 --> 34:30.372
- I know.

34:30.503 --> 34:32.374
And I want Sam and Elliot to have it.

34:32.505 --> 34:34.637
I think it would be nice for them to have.

34:34.724 --> 34:36.204
Like, it's just,

34:36.335 --> 34:38.206
and something's, ah, there it is.

34:39.990 --> 34:40.643
Hmm.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.386
- Babe, I don't, I don't.
- It's nice.

34:44.517 --> 34:46.562
- I don't think we should
give them this stuff.

34:47.389 --> 34:48.999
- Why?

34:49.087 --> 34:51.567
We were saving
Bubba for something.

34:53.047 --> 34:56.833
- Yeah, but he's
currently living in a box.

34:56.964 --> 34:58.096
And I want him to be used.

34:58.183 --> 34:58.966
And so,

35:00.663 --> 35:04.102
let's give him to some
people that would use him.

35:04.189 --> 35:05.929
- I thought we
were going to use.

35:11.587 --> 35:12.458
So are you...

35:14.503 --> 35:15.852
- I don't want to talk.

35:15.983 --> 35:16.723
I don't want to do this right now.

35:16.810 --> 35:17.637
- Just hold on.

35:20.292 --> 35:21.989
It's like, you're saying
we're never going to have-

35:22.076 --> 35:23.904
- I can't do this right now.

35:24.034 --> 35:24.948
- Okay, we haven't
talked about it.

35:25.079 --> 35:26.776
I mean, it's been-
- Not now.

35:28.126 --> 35:29.866
I just want to give them something nice.

35:29.997 --> 35:32.521
He lives in a fucking box.

35:32.608 --> 35:33.305
Please.

35:34.523 --> 35:35.829
Please just give me five minutes.

35:37.396 --> 35:37.961
- Just please don't
make this decision

35:38.048 --> 35:40.094
until we do talk about it.

35:40.225 --> 35:41.835
You can have, take the time you need,

35:41.965 --> 35:43.793
but you, can we not,

35:43.924 --> 35:46.448
just make a call on it yet?

35:46.579 --> 35:47.580
Let's talk about tomorrow.

35:53.977 --> 35:55.327
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:42.112 --> 36:44.289
You need help?

36:44.419 --> 36:46.813
- You look beautiful.

36:46.900 --> 36:48.423
- You look beautiful.

36:48.510 --> 36:50.599
No, I don't need any help.

36:50.686 --> 36:51.426
I got this.

36:51.513 --> 36:52.862
You do the table.

36:52.993 --> 36:54.951
I do the food prep.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.257
Everything is-
- Situation and-

36:56.344 --> 36:57.215
- Everything's
right on schedule.

36:57.302 --> 36:58.955
- I don't know that.
- It is.

36:59.086 --> 37:02.916
- I don't want us to end up
eating at like 11:30 at night.

37:03.046 --> 37:03.960
That's not going to happen.

37:04.047 --> 37:05.832
- It happened once.

37:05.962 --> 37:06.920
- That was not ny fault.

37:07.050 --> 37:09.139
That was a technical issue.

37:09.270 --> 37:10.228
It had nothing to do with me.

37:10.315 --> 37:11.925
A little bit, your fault.

37:13.535 --> 37:15.058
You sure you don't want help?

37:15.145 --> 37:16.103
No, I'm good.

37:16.234 --> 37:17.017
You set the table.

37:17.104 --> 37:18.148
- I'm done setting the table.

37:18.279 --> 37:19.628
Okay, well just relax.

37:19.715 --> 37:20.803
You can hang with me, but I'm good.

37:20.934 --> 37:21.717
I'm going to do the chopping.

37:21.804 --> 37:23.153
I got this under control.

37:23.284 --> 37:25.243
- Okay.

37:25.373 --> 37:27.201
I think I'm just going to grab a salad.

37:27.288 --> 37:28.463
- What, no, no.

37:28.550 --> 37:29.943
There's no salad in this.

37:30.073 --> 37:31.292
This does not include salad.

37:31.379 --> 37:32.685
- It's just a salad.

37:32.772 --> 37:33.555
- Please, please,
please, please.

37:33.686 --> 37:34.252
There's no salad in this.

37:34.339 --> 37:35.122
There's no salad.

37:35.253 --> 37:36.906
I've got everything organized.

37:36.993 --> 37:37.907
Everything is going exactly
where it's supposed to go

37:37.994 --> 37:39.387
at the right time

37:39.518 --> 37:40.910
and I just don't want you
messing with it with salad.

37:40.997 --> 37:41.911
- Okay, I'm not messing with it.

37:41.998 --> 37:42.695
I just wanted to make, it's okay.

37:42.782 --> 37:44.044
- I know, I'm sorry.

37:44.131 --> 37:45.306
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

37:45.437 --> 37:46.133
- It's okay.

37:48.918 --> 37:49.702
What's going on?

37:52.922 --> 37:53.967
Jason?

37:56.752 --> 37:57.449
Hey.

37:59.755 --> 38:00.974
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

38:02.192 --> 38:06.588
You just been a little weird lately

38:06.719 --> 38:09.983
about food and particularly
the stuff with the sourdough

38:10.113 --> 38:11.071
and the sandwiches.

38:11.201 --> 38:14.640
The shit at the market with the pie.

38:14.727 --> 38:16.990
You've been chopping vegetables
for like an hour and a half.

38:18.557 --> 38:21.037
You snuck upstairs to have
that weird phone call.

38:21.168 --> 38:21.995
Little hushed voices.

38:22.125 --> 38:23.083
I heard you.

38:23.170 --> 38:24.345
- Oh no, that.

38:24.476 --> 38:25.781
I didn't want to-

38:25.868 --> 38:26.391
- And since
when did we go upstairs

38:26.521 --> 38:27.305
with hushed voices?

38:27.392 --> 38:28.784
- I didn't want you to hear it.

38:28.871 --> 38:29.655
Who were you talking to, then?

38:29.785 --> 38:30.308
- Richard calling me about,

38:30.395 --> 38:31.787
bugging me about pages.

38:31.874 --> 38:32.614
And I didn't want you to
hear me have a work call

38:32.788 --> 38:35.051
'cause I said no work calls.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.444
And I promised we weren't
going to do that and then-

38:36.575 --> 38:38.533
- Does Richard often
ask where I am?

38:38.664 --> 38:39.926
- What?

38:40.013 --> 38:40.796
- Why did you have
to explain to Richard

38:40.927 --> 38:41.710
where I was in the house?

38:41.797 --> 38:42.668
And my exact whereabouts?

38:42.798 --> 38:43.973
- I don't think I did that.

38:44.060 --> 38:45.932
- I absolutely
heard you say that.

38:46.019 --> 38:46.846
And then you got it

38:46.976 --> 38:48.195
and you're trying to work on it

38:48.282 --> 38:49.501
and you're trying to fix it.

38:50.763 --> 38:52.112
I'm sorry.

38:52.242 --> 38:53.461
The food thing is weird, I get it.

38:53.592 --> 38:54.897
I'm under a lot of pressure, okay?

38:54.984 --> 38:56.203
- Copy. Cool

38:56.334 --> 38:57.770
What I'm saying is-

38:57.857 --> 38:59.162
- No, I understand.

38:59.249 --> 39:00.729
You're under a tremendous
amount of pressure.

39:00.816 --> 39:02.340
I know.

39:02.427 --> 39:06.256
You have a ukulele deadline coming.

39:06.387 --> 39:06.996
You're under pressure.

39:07.127 --> 39:08.084
I got it.

39:08.215 --> 39:09.869
You're under pressure.

39:09.999 --> 39:11.349
- It is not possible that I
could also be under pressure?

39:11.436 --> 39:13.351
- It's not possible
for you to be

39:13.438 --> 39:14.917
under the same amount of pressure.

39:15.004 --> 39:16.658
- Did I say-

39:16.789 --> 39:17.790
Did I say that I was under
the same amount of pressure?

39:17.877 --> 39:19.269
- You used the word pressure.

39:19.357 --> 39:20.880
What possible pressures
do you have in your life?

39:21.010 --> 39:22.272
- You know, what's-

39:22.360 --> 39:24.100
- To make you go so
strange and crazy

39:24.231 --> 39:26.233
to sneak around and
have strange phone calls

39:26.320 --> 39:29.149
to be so obsessed with food.

39:29.279 --> 39:31.369
- Jen, there's a lot
going on right now, okay.

39:31.456 --> 39:33.109
- What is going on, then?

39:33.240 --> 39:35.329
- I'm trying to support
you and be there for you.

39:35.416 --> 39:36.591
And I'm just,

39:36.678 --> 39:37.462
I'm constantly trying to lift you up.

39:37.592 --> 39:39.289
- That's your job as my husband!

39:39.377 --> 39:41.422
- You have no idea
what I'm doing

39:41.509 --> 39:42.902
to help you find your cure, okay?

39:42.989 --> 39:44.338
- I have no idea?

39:44.469 --> 39:45.774
I'm lifting
you up, all the time.

39:45.861 --> 39:47.472
- You're doing nothing except
playing the fucking banjo.

39:47.602 --> 39:49.212
- How can you say that to me!

39:49.299 --> 39:52.259
- And chopping vegetables,
is all you're doing.

39:52.346 --> 39:54.261
That's all you ever do is sit on your ass.

39:54.348 --> 39:56.089
It took you 10 years to write a book.

39:56.176 --> 39:58.134
It takes you 10 years to do anything.

39:58.265 --> 39:59.614
Don't tell me you're helping me.

39:59.701 --> 40:01.050
Do you think I want to be here?

40:01.137 --> 40:02.356
- I don't want to
do this anymore!

40:02.487 --> 40:03.488
- I don't want to do
this anymore, either.

40:03.575 --> 40:04.314
- I don't want to
do this anymore!

40:04.445 --> 40:05.620
- I don't want to do it either.

40:05.707 --> 40:06.491
Great, we're on the same page.

40:06.621 --> 40:08.014
- They're here!

40:08.144 --> 40:10.408
They're here.

40:16.762 --> 40:17.632
- Hi.

40:17.763 --> 40:18.416
Aww!

40:22.681 --> 40:24.204
Oh my God.

40:24.291 --> 40:25.814
- I know, it's been a minute.

40:25.901 --> 40:26.598
- Oh my God.

40:28.251 --> 40:29.644
- Hey, I'm coming in.

40:29.731 --> 40:30.340
Can I hug her first?

40:31.167 --> 40:33.213
It's okay, never mind.

40:33.300 --> 40:34.649
Hi.
- How are you?

40:34.736 --> 40:36.608
- Great, how are you?
- Good.

40:36.695 --> 40:38.523
- Oh.
- Hey, welcome.

40:38.653 --> 40:39.437
- Congratulations.
- How you doing?

40:39.524 --> 40:40.873
- Good.
- You?

40:40.960 --> 40:42.178
- Good, what's that?

40:42.309 --> 40:42.962
No, I'm just happy for you guys.

40:43.049 --> 40:44.529
- Dessert, my man.

40:44.659 --> 40:45.312
- Okay.
- Two ounces of watermelon.

40:45.443 --> 40:47.096
One ounce of water.

40:47.183 --> 40:49.229
- Seems like a fair trade.

40:49.359 --> 40:50.535
Let's be careful with it, shall we?

40:50.665 --> 40:52.275
- What's happening,
how you feeling?

40:52.362 --> 40:53.233
- I can smell something.
- Good.

40:53.320 --> 40:53.973
- Yeah?
- How you'd doing?

40:54.060 --> 40:55.670
- Good, I'm great.

40:55.757 --> 40:58.238
- I'm good, how are you?
- Thank you for coming.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.892
- Of course.
- Taking up a little more.

40:59.979 --> 41:01.894
- How was the uh-
- How could I not come-

41:01.981 --> 41:03.330
- Be careful, careful
with the steps!

41:03.417 --> 41:04.897
- She's fine.
- How was the drive?

41:04.984 --> 41:07.682
- Please, let's not do
that anymore, this weekend.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.510
- This is a very-
- She's fine.

41:09.597 --> 41:13.296
- She has to help me upstairs.
- Precious cargo.

41:22.784 --> 41:24.133
- I'm so, so sorry.

41:30.313 --> 41:31.489
I really fucked up.

41:38.147 --> 41:38.887
- Yeah.

41:41.977 --> 41:42.674
Yeah.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.242
Yeah, so did I.

41:46.329 --> 41:47.505
We both did, right?

41:49.028 --> 41:50.072
- Yeah.

41:57.166 --> 41:58.080
- So, how's it going?

42:05.174 --> 42:06.262
- Not well.

42:09.875 --> 42:10.528
- Shit.

42:16.882 --> 42:18.710
God, is there any way we can just tell her?

42:19.667 --> 42:20.712
- Sammy.

42:20.799 --> 42:22.104
Sammy?

42:22.191 --> 42:22.888
Look at me.

42:24.411 --> 42:26.326
That is not an option.

42:26.413 --> 42:27.240
Do you get that?

42:36.597 --> 42:37.293
- Yeah.

42:39.774 --> 42:40.732
- We got this.

42:47.652 --> 42:50.306
You going to be a dad?

42:50.393 --> 42:51.830
- Yes, I'm going to be a dad.

42:51.960 --> 42:53.875
- You're gonna be a dad.

42:54.006 --> 42:54.572
- I know.

42:56.269 --> 42:57.705
How did that happen, Jennifer?

42:57.836 --> 43:00.882
I can tell you.

43:01.013 --> 43:02.275
How do you feel?

43:02.405 --> 43:03.145
- Um.

43:05.887 --> 43:06.584
I, you know.

43:09.108 --> 43:11.545
Are you okay to talk about this?

43:11.676 --> 43:13.286
- Yes.
- Seriously for real?

43:13.416 --> 43:16.202
- Oh, um, thank you.

43:16.245 --> 43:17.812
Yeah. Yes.

43:19.684 --> 43:21.381
- I'm going to have a kid.
- I know.

43:21.468 --> 43:23.252
- In like three months.

43:23.383 --> 43:24.471
Come on, look where we live.

43:24.645 --> 43:25.777
Look, what's happening.

43:27.474 --> 43:29.041
How am I supposed to welcome
someone into the world,

43:29.171 --> 43:30.608
knowing that?

43:30.695 --> 43:32.610
- You're going to fix this

43:32.697 --> 43:34.699
and you're going to do it with me.

43:34.829 --> 43:37.353
And so, the baby's going to be fine

43:37.440 --> 43:38.137
and you're going to be fine.

43:39.442 --> 43:40.879
It's okay to be scared.

43:40.966 --> 43:41.619
You should be.

43:43.533 --> 43:44.578
You'll probably fuck it up.

43:44.665 --> 43:46.319
You will fuck it up.

43:46.449 --> 43:48.190
- Thank you, Jennifer.

43:48.277 --> 43:49.627
- You're welcome.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.415
- How are you, really?

43:55.502 --> 43:56.459
How's the weekend going?

43:58.766 --> 44:00.333
- I don't know,
I'm a little lost.

44:02.552 --> 44:03.292
- How so?

44:05.164 --> 44:06.208
- I just, uh.

44:08.471 --> 44:11.474
Before you came, we had a fight,

44:11.561 --> 44:14.956
just devolved into madness.

44:15.087 --> 44:17.393
And I said things and he said things

44:17.524 --> 44:19.308
and they were hurtful
and they were bad and...

44:21.702 --> 44:23.661
- I think we got to
give them some slack.

44:23.748 --> 44:25.401
I mean, both of them.

44:25.532 --> 44:28.100
Just think of the
pressure they're under.

44:28.187 --> 44:30.798
They're trying to take care
of us and connect to us.

44:30.885 --> 44:33.627
We're off doing, God
knows what, in their eyes.

44:33.758 --> 44:35.194
They don't understand what we're doing.

44:36.586 --> 44:38.501
They just see what we're coming home,

44:38.588 --> 44:39.894
weighted down with every night.

44:39.981 --> 44:40.460
And they're trying to
figure out how to love us.

44:40.547 --> 44:42.375
And that's...

44:42.505 --> 44:43.593
So he's been tasked with trying

44:43.724 --> 44:45.247
to give you a good weekend here,

44:45.334 --> 44:47.032
a relaxing weekend,

44:47.162 --> 44:49.774
a way to get rid of all the
other stresses as best he can.

44:49.861 --> 44:51.863
And he doesn't understand
that, that's impossible.

44:54.169 --> 44:55.257
He loves you so much.

44:58.957 --> 45:00.306
- I know.

45:00.393 --> 45:03.526
- Just try to give
over to it, you know?

45:03.613 --> 45:04.571
And cut off some slack.

45:06.355 --> 45:07.443
- Thank you.

45:11.099 --> 45:11.752
- No problem.

45:14.712 --> 45:15.451
- Are we done?

45:16.496 --> 45:18.280
- Jesus. Come on.

45:18.411 --> 45:20.239
- I just want to
know if it's over.

45:20.369 --> 45:22.415
It was nice.

45:23.808 --> 45:24.765
So welcome to Colombia,

45:25.940 --> 45:27.768
is the unofficial national dish.

45:27.855 --> 45:30.989
So don't be intimidated by
the number of dishes you see

45:31.076 --> 45:32.642
'cause it all comes
together on your plate.

45:32.773 --> 45:34.993
You can just start with rice.

45:35.123 --> 45:36.690
You're going to add red beans,

45:36.821 --> 45:39.345
which is cooked through
with slow roasted pork.

45:39.432 --> 45:40.607
We've got ground beef,

45:40.738 --> 45:43.349
I've got a chorizo and more pork.

45:43.479 --> 45:45.177
Plantains, fried plantain,

45:45.264 --> 45:47.179
and then you've got fresh avocado.

45:47.266 --> 45:48.833
There's no right or wrong way to do this.

45:48.963 --> 45:51.183
- I just wanted to
ask you traditionally-

45:51.313 --> 45:52.793
- Yeah.

45:52.880 --> 45:54.664
- This dish is served
single serving.

45:54.795 --> 45:56.318
It's never served family style.

45:56.449 --> 45:57.624
So I'm curious about
why you made the choice

45:57.755 --> 45:58.973
to do it this way.

46:01.584 --> 46:03.021
- I guess I'm giving
it my own twist.

46:03.108 --> 46:04.631
Give me a fried egg.

46:04.718 --> 46:06.415
- The yolk is usually runny.

46:06.502 --> 46:07.808
- Ah, you really boned up

46:07.895 --> 46:09.854
on your Colombian food history, there.

46:09.941 --> 46:12.030
- I did, about 20 years.
- He lived in Colombia.

46:12.117 --> 46:13.596
- Oh, you lived in Colombia?
- We lived there.

46:13.683 --> 46:14.859
- So you actually,

46:14.989 --> 46:16.382
you've eaten the real thing.
- Yeah.

46:16.512 --> 46:17.992
- How's it taste, though?

46:19.080 --> 46:20.516
- It's tastes great.

46:20.647 --> 46:21.822
The Elliot stamp of approval.

46:21.909 --> 46:22.823
- Thank you, man.
- You did it.

46:22.954 --> 46:23.998
- I appreciate it.

46:24.085 --> 46:25.304
- And most
importantly, at least,

46:25.434 --> 46:26.871
we're not being
served at 1:00 a.m.

46:27.001 --> 46:28.960
Oh.

46:31.049 --> 46:32.224
- Is this never
going to be forgiven?

46:32.354 --> 46:33.181
- No.

46:33.268 --> 46:34.879
- It was a technical issue.

46:37.707 --> 46:41.102
- I desperately want you
guys to tell the story

46:41.233 --> 46:42.712
of your very first date.

46:42.843 --> 46:43.670
- I've heard enough about it.

46:43.801 --> 46:44.802
I don't know that we need to-

46:44.932 --> 46:46.107
- You need to hear
the story, it's fun.

46:46.238 --> 46:47.805
- It wasn't a date.
- It was, yeah.

46:47.892 --> 46:49.241
- It was a date
and it was a kiss.

46:49.371 --> 46:50.720
- No.

46:50.851 --> 46:51.765
You lept like Clark Kent into the crowd

46:51.852 --> 46:54.724
and suddenly started body surfing.

46:54.812 --> 46:57.162
It was just like hands on
butts and boots and faces.

46:57.292 --> 46:58.641
- Hands on butts?
- Oh, I mean, yeah.

46:58.728 --> 47:00.165
- People are propelling you.
- 'Cause they're passing-

47:00.295 --> 47:01.514
- They're passing
you from one to the other.

47:01.644 --> 47:03.298
- Oh, I thought you
meant your hands.

47:03.385 --> 47:04.909
Your hands were on-
- No.

47:04.996 --> 47:08.086
- That's another version.
- No, it was like, yeah.

47:08.216 --> 47:10.349
So you got pushed into kissing?

47:10.479 --> 47:11.176
You were forced into it.
- Pushed into, yes.

47:11.306 --> 47:12.699
Physical contact.

47:12.786 --> 47:15.136
- And threw you into
a passionate kiss.

47:15.267 --> 47:16.834
- It was not a passionate kiss.

47:16.921 --> 47:18.705
- And that was all
we needed to know.

47:18.836 --> 47:19.967
That was-

47:20.098 --> 47:21.273
- The first one
doesn't sound romantic.

47:21.360 --> 47:22.448
But was the second one romantic?

47:22.578 --> 47:24.537
The second kiss?

47:24.624 --> 47:26.147
- It was like
literally two seconds.

47:26.278 --> 47:27.540
Tried again and it was-

47:27.670 --> 47:28.628
- It wasn't even a do-over.

47:28.758 --> 47:29.934
So you remember that right?

47:30.021 --> 47:30.760
- You were trying to
finish what you started?

47:30.891 --> 47:32.066
- And we could tell instantly-

47:32.153 --> 47:33.415
- And definitely.
- There was nothing going on.

47:33.502 --> 47:34.634
Nope.

47:34.721 --> 47:35.940
- Well, it's interesting,

47:36.027 --> 47:37.071
how many times you told the story.

47:37.158 --> 47:38.507
How come we're only hearing this now?

47:38.594 --> 47:39.813
- You never wanted
to hear it before.

47:39.944 --> 47:40.509
- I heard some of this.
- You find it amusing.

47:40.640 --> 47:41.554
- It's hilarious.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.208
- It's such a boring story.

47:43.338 --> 47:45.732
- You wanna maybe tell us
about any other kisses?

47:47.560 --> 47:48.126
Is there a
third, or a fourth or a fifth?

47:48.256 --> 47:49.518
- Yeah, exactly.

47:49.605 --> 47:50.824
- Maybe we should
go to a concert.

47:50.955 --> 47:52.130
Yeah, let's go bang teeth.

47:54.610 --> 47:56.525
- I'm gonna try some
of the crazy hot sauce.

47:57.657 --> 47:58.440
You wanna try it?

48:01.443 --> 48:02.009
- I'll follow you.

48:03.315 --> 48:04.707
- What is, the frig is this?

48:04.794 --> 48:06.535
I'll follow you, business?

48:06.622 --> 48:09.103
- The first summer after we
hooked up, I had to leave.

48:09.190 --> 48:11.323
- After we hooked up.
- Less romantic.

48:11.410 --> 48:13.586
- To go back to Winnipeg
to work at my dad's store.

48:13.716 --> 48:14.761
- I thought we would,

48:14.848 --> 48:15.893
I did not think we were going to see-

48:15.980 --> 48:17.503
- Totally gone.
- Until he came-

48:17.590 --> 48:18.417
- Taking the summer off.

48:18.547 --> 48:20.506
And then I get to my dad's.

48:20.636 --> 48:21.463
One of the first day,

48:21.550 --> 48:22.160
the first morning.

48:22.290 --> 48:23.074
Who walks in the door?

48:23.161 --> 48:23.944
The first customer in the door.

48:24.075 --> 48:25.728
And she said, I followed you.

48:25.815 --> 48:27.165
And this became our...

48:27.252 --> 48:28.949
It didn't become a thing
until the next year

48:29.080 --> 48:30.342
when we graduated

48:30.429 --> 48:31.909
and you got into the
master's program at UVic

48:32.039 --> 48:34.824
and I gave up my life to go and follow you.

48:34.955 --> 48:35.608
You gave up your life?

48:35.738 --> 48:36.609
- Well, you know,

48:36.739 --> 48:37.827
brought my life with me-

48:37.958 --> 48:39.917
- With you, as I
brought my life, yeah.

48:40.004 --> 48:40.918
And that's the thing,

48:41.005 --> 48:42.223
- And then, we kept doing that.

48:42.354 --> 48:43.616
And then you kept doing that.

48:43.746 --> 48:45.009
- Well, I went to
Dublin for the PhD.

48:45.139 --> 48:47.707
- Followed her again
and then again.

48:47.794 --> 48:50.318
And then you followed her again.

48:50.405 --> 48:52.146
Well.

48:52.233 --> 48:54.409
There's reciprocity in the following.

48:54.540 --> 48:58.326
It's not just him sort of
stalking me around the globe.

48:58.457 --> 49:00.024
I understand,
you're both following in love.

49:00.154 --> 49:02.896
- Aww.
- It's a beautiful story.

49:02.983 --> 49:04.463
- Thank you.
- Aww.

49:05.768 --> 49:07.988
- That's a good one.
- Hmm.

49:09.816 --> 49:10.860
- Well, that's the story.

49:10.991 --> 49:12.253
- It's a good one.
- It's a great one.

49:12.340 --> 49:14.038
- And I have no idea-
- Thank you for sharing.

49:14.168 --> 49:16.257
Thank you for asking.

49:19.478 --> 49:20.783
I want more than five, though.

49:21.567 --> 49:22.394
Savor it.

49:27.442 --> 49:28.661
- Nice!

49:29.792 --> 49:30.837
- Try it again.
- So, what-

49:32.970 --> 49:34.667
- Oh my gosh, I got it close.

49:35.929 --> 49:37.626
- Good shot.
- Perfect.

49:40.368 --> 49:41.891
- Nailed it.
- Yes.

49:42.022 --> 49:43.806
- Your point.
- Oh, that was terrible.

49:43.893 --> 49:45.243
Good effort, good effort.

49:45.330 --> 49:47.201
- One more time for the baby.
- Good effort.

49:47.288 --> 49:49.551
- A for effort.
- That was a half measure.

49:52.990 --> 49:53.816
- This is fun.

49:55.079 --> 49:56.471
- Nope, no, no, no.

49:56.558 --> 49:57.820
- You gotta redo.
- Look over there.

49:57.907 --> 49:59.605
- You want some of this?
- Okay.

50:02.260 --> 50:03.609
- You're counting
your ounces today?

50:03.696 --> 50:04.653
- Don't worry about me.

50:05.654 --> 50:09.745
Hmm.

50:09.876 --> 50:11.660
Measures out so we each get five pieces.

50:11.747 --> 50:12.879
You've had more than five pieces.

50:12.966 --> 50:13.749
- I know what I'm doing, okay.

50:13.880 --> 50:14.489
- It's gonna fuck you up if you-

50:14.576 --> 50:16.143
- I know what I'm doing.

50:17.492 --> 50:18.754
- Great.

50:18.885 --> 50:20.365
- Since I can't bend over.
- Nice.

50:22.280 --> 50:23.020
- My turn.
- Yep.

50:24.978 --> 50:27.546
- I wanna apologize
for, um, something.

50:29.330 --> 50:30.418
I uh...

50:32.116 --> 50:34.335
I've just taken Elliot
away, a lot for work.

50:34.466 --> 50:35.989
And I know that right now,

50:36.120 --> 50:36.990
you should be with your husband and-

50:37.077 --> 50:37.991
- It's okay.
- And I felt bad about it.

50:38.078 --> 50:39.340
- No, please.
- I know.

50:39.471 --> 50:40.254
- You have to do
what you have to do.

50:40.341 --> 50:41.429
- Right.
- It's fine.

50:41.516 --> 50:43.257
And I'm not alone.

50:43.344 --> 50:44.476
I mean, you've got Elliot.

50:44.563 --> 50:45.738
And I've got Jason.

50:46.869 --> 50:48.741
- Wait, okay.
- But.

50:48.871 --> 50:50.090
Having lunch once a week

50:50.177 --> 50:51.961
does not make up for a missing husband.

50:52.092 --> 50:54.486
- And dinner and movies

50:54.616 --> 50:56.488
and card games

50:56.575 --> 50:58.185
and you know,

50:58.316 --> 50:59.143
whatever Jason wants to do.

50:59.273 --> 51:00.013
I'm like, okay.

51:00.100 --> 51:01.797
So, I'm far from alone.

51:01.884 --> 51:04.713
It's fine, please.

51:04.800 --> 51:06.585
Don't ever feel like you need to apologize.

51:08.500 --> 51:09.066
Oh!

51:11.111 --> 51:12.765
So you'll go first, Sammy.

51:12.895 --> 51:15.246
You'll pick five
questions out of the bowl.

51:18.075 --> 51:21.295
- Which family
member annoys you?

51:21.382 --> 51:22.731
- Elliot, what'd you get?

51:22.818 --> 51:25.734
- That would be
your racist uncle.

51:25.821 --> 51:27.867
- Yes, I'm going to go
with uncle Tim, as well.

51:27.954 --> 51:28.955
He is racist and he is-

51:29.086 --> 51:30.522
- Your uncle Tim is racist?

51:30.652 --> 51:32.132
Sorry.

51:32.219 --> 51:32.872
- And he was an
inappropriate tickler.

51:32.959 --> 51:33.960
- He's not inappropriate.

51:34.091 --> 51:35.875
He's just a tickle monster.

51:35.962 --> 51:36.658
- Well, that's inappropriate.

51:36.745 --> 51:37.659
What do you got?

51:38.704 --> 51:40.314
- Your mom.

51:40.401 --> 51:41.315
- Well, I think Elliot
would agree with that.

51:41.402 --> 51:42.011
- Hmm hmm.

51:42.142 --> 51:42.751
- What was your answer?

51:42.882 --> 51:43.796
- Uncle Tim.

51:43.926 --> 51:45.189
- Hmm, I get a point.

51:45.319 --> 51:46.973
Okay. Second question.

51:47.060 --> 51:51.238
- What I most like
about the weekend?

51:52.718 --> 51:53.849
- Morning sex.

51:53.936 --> 51:54.589
I know this.

51:54.720 --> 51:56.025
I shouldn't-

51:56.156 --> 51:56.722
- Uh oh, Elliot.

51:56.852 --> 51:58.419
What'd you get?

51:58.550 --> 52:00.117
- My cooking is a favorite
part of her weekend.

52:00.204 --> 52:02.597
- I'm going to go
with the sleep in.

52:02.728 --> 52:05.557
- Yes, you're all right.

52:05.644 --> 52:07.167
- But what did you write
down, as the question?

52:07.298 --> 52:09.778
- Lately, you know,

52:09.865 --> 52:11.084
it's definitely been the sleep in.

52:11.171 --> 52:12.433
Ah.

52:12.564 --> 52:13.956
- But I'll take your
cooking any day.

52:15.828 --> 52:17.395
Favorite smell.

52:17.482 --> 52:20.615
- Her favorite smell is Musk.

52:20.746 --> 52:22.051
- Hmm, okay.

52:22.182 --> 52:23.662
I also have Musk, but I'm doing,

52:23.792 --> 52:25.011
I'm guessing a three-way tie

52:25.098 --> 52:27.448
between Musk, Jasmine and lilacs.

52:27.579 --> 52:28.145
What do you got?

52:29.015 --> 52:31.322
- I said food.

52:32.845 --> 52:34.368
- So vague.
- Not the worst guess.

52:34.455 --> 52:35.413
- No, mine's vague.

52:35.500 --> 52:37.110
Yours is very, very specific.

52:37.241 --> 52:38.111
- I'll tell ya what,
I know I'm right

52:38.198 --> 52:39.068
and I'll tell you why.

52:39.199 --> 52:39.808
- It's pretty specific.

52:39.939 --> 52:41.027
- You know, right?

52:41.114 --> 52:42.420
- What did you say mine was?

52:42.507 --> 52:43.160
- It's Musk.

52:44.117 --> 52:47.076
- Okay baby, you're not wrong.

52:47.207 --> 52:47.860
But you're the most right.

52:47.990 --> 52:50.689
- So round two,

52:50.819 --> 52:54.171
how often would I like to have sex.

52:54.258 --> 52:56.085
- Don't care.
- Every single day.

52:56.216 --> 52:57.957
- Hmm.
- Probably twice a day.

52:58.044 --> 52:59.480
Maybe three times a day.

52:59.611 --> 53:00.481
- What did you write down?

53:00.612 --> 53:02.266
- I wrote every single day.

53:02.396 --> 53:04.050
- Every single day.
- Every day.

53:04.137 --> 53:06.139
- Elliot, what do you think
is my sexual appetite?

53:07.575 --> 53:08.968
- That's interesting,

53:09.098 --> 53:11.666
'cause I actually down,
half to one time a week.

53:13.712 --> 53:15.627
- Okay.

53:15.757 --> 53:16.367
Sammy?

53:18.020 --> 53:18.717
- Three times a week.

53:22.068 --> 53:23.765
- I wrote down
three times a week.

53:23.896 --> 53:26.812
But I'm sure that
Jennifer is much more correct.

53:26.899 --> 53:28.248
- Every day would be splendid.

53:28.379 --> 53:29.206
- Yes.
- I just.

53:29.293 --> 53:30.468
I didn't want to push it.

53:30.555 --> 53:32.034
I didn't want to push my luck.

53:35.516 --> 53:36.474
Okay.

53:36.604 --> 53:37.431
Four and...

53:37.518 --> 53:40.695
What is a skill that I have,

53:41.740 --> 53:43.872
that nobody else knows about?

53:43.959 --> 53:45.265
- Sweetheart, what'd you get?

53:45.352 --> 53:47.702
- I just only found
this out recently.

53:49.008 --> 53:50.357
Playing the banjo.

53:51.837 --> 53:52.577
- It's a ukulele.

53:53.882 --> 53:54.622
Elliot?

53:55.754 --> 53:58.147
- Just grasping at straws here.

53:58.278 --> 53:59.801
Sleep doctor.

54:03.109 --> 54:06.895
Right?

54:10.072 --> 54:11.073
- Why is that funny?

54:11.204 --> 54:13.902
- No, this is drinking
too much watermelon

54:13.989 --> 54:16.775
and getting just a tad water toxic.

54:16.862 --> 54:19.038
So Sammy?

54:19.168 --> 54:20.996
- I know it's the ukulele.
- You okay?

54:21.127 --> 54:23.042
- But another string instrument.

54:23.129 --> 54:24.304
- She meant ukulele,

54:24.391 --> 54:25.087
by the way.
- I'm sure.

54:25.218 --> 54:26.306
- Yeah.
- Number four.

54:26.393 --> 54:27.699
What is my favorite dessert?

54:27.786 --> 54:28.961
- I don't know.

54:29.091 --> 54:30.963
- My favorite dessert, come on.

54:31.093 --> 54:32.138
- What'd you write down?

54:32.269 --> 54:34.183
- Sam, tell me.

54:34.314 --> 54:37.535
- Well, I only know 'cause if
it's not really, really warm,

54:37.665 --> 54:38.797
you send it back.
- Ah!

54:40.277 --> 54:42.017
- It's molten
chocolate lava cake.

54:42.104 --> 54:43.497
- But you knew this.

54:43.584 --> 54:44.846
She knew that, too.

54:44.977 --> 54:46.935
- I'm sure it's changed,
but like for 20 years.

54:47.022 --> 54:48.415
- You know what guys,
you don't have to explain

54:48.546 --> 54:50.548
and rationalize every answer, okay?

54:50.678 --> 54:51.940
You guys are good friends, that's fine.

54:52.027 --> 54:52.898
- Didn't know that was
one of the rules, yeah.

54:52.985 --> 54:54.291
- Probably because you guys

54:54.421 --> 54:55.335
are just spending every day together.

54:55.422 --> 54:56.380
- Well, there's a whole
thing with the smells.

54:56.510 --> 54:58.120
- See, this is what
I don't I understand.

54:58.207 --> 54:59.513
If you guys have been spending
all this time together.

54:59.600 --> 55:00.993
- Hmm hmm.

55:01.123 --> 55:02.168
- Are you writing?

55:02.299 --> 55:04.388
Where is, how you working on your book?

55:06.172 --> 55:08.130
He hasn't
touched it in six months.

55:11.351 --> 55:13.788
You know, been doing other things, right?

55:15.007 --> 55:17.052
Other skills, life skills.

55:18.227 --> 55:19.838
Like hanging out skills.

55:19.968 --> 55:22.493
Learning an instrument, right?

55:24.973 --> 55:26.671
- Yeah, um.

55:27.715 --> 55:30.022
Sorry, you said, you know,

55:30.152 --> 55:31.197
just because you guys have
been going out to lunch,

55:31.284 --> 55:32.894
he hasn't touched his book in six months?

55:33.025 --> 55:34.243
- I mean, maybe he has.

55:34.374 --> 55:35.419
As far as I know, I don't know.

55:35.549 --> 55:37.029
- No, no, no, it's
been off and on.

55:37.159 --> 55:37.899
I mean, it's-
- Yeah.

55:39.945 --> 55:41.903
Well, yeah, we should go.

55:42.034 --> 55:44.123
- Yeah, we should-
- I'll drive.

55:44.210 --> 55:45.080
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

55:45.167 --> 55:46.125
- Yeah, I'm fine.

55:46.212 --> 55:47.996
I can drive.

55:48.083 --> 55:49.694
- No.
- I can drive, yeah.

55:49.824 --> 55:52.218
Easy does it.

55:52.349 --> 55:53.001
Step.

55:54.133 --> 55:56.004
Thank you, so much.

55:56.091 --> 55:57.179
- You're welcome.
- Thanks for coming, guys.

55:57.266 --> 55:59.138
- That was a fantastic day.

55:59.225 --> 56:00.226
- It really was, guys.

56:00.357 --> 56:02.010
You knocked yourselves out.

56:02.141 --> 56:03.229
Thank you so much.

56:03.360 --> 56:04.012
Key?

56:05.405 --> 56:07.320
- That's good.
- Okay.

56:07.451 --> 56:09.104
- See ya, Monday.
- See ya, Monday!

56:38.612 --> 56:40.048
- Hey.
- Hey.

56:40.135 --> 56:41.441
- Water, I brought
your water up.

56:41.572 --> 56:43.356
You still have like, 10 left,

56:43.443 --> 56:45.314
even with the watermelon, so.

56:45.445 --> 56:47.316
That's good.
- Thank you.

56:47.447 --> 56:48.579
- You got a good drink tonight.

57:00.939 --> 57:02.593
- Getting an early jump on the-

57:06.423 --> 57:08.120
What are you doing?

57:11.471 --> 57:12.951
- Don't ask me stupid questions.

57:13.081 --> 57:14.692
Don't do that.

57:14.822 --> 57:16.215
- Put your stuff-
- Don't do that.

57:16.302 --> 57:17.434
- Put your stuff away.

57:23.701 --> 57:26.094
- Why have you been lying
to me about your book?

57:29.489 --> 57:30.185
No.

57:34.451 --> 57:38.455
Why are you a liar?

57:42.459 --> 57:44.156
You've been lying to me about your book.

57:45.287 --> 57:46.332
You lied about Richard.

57:47.986 --> 57:50.205
You lied about hanging
out with Sam every day.

57:52.947 --> 57:55.559
So I'm packing because I
don't want to stick around

57:55.646 --> 57:58.475
to find out how much more
you've been lying about.

58:04.002 --> 58:05.830
Why were you lying to me about your book?

58:07.962 --> 58:08.659
- Okay.

58:09.921 --> 58:12.097
I stopped writing because I,

58:12.184 --> 58:13.794
I haven't been able to,

58:13.925 --> 58:18.756
I haven't been able to write
because I don't see a point

58:18.843 --> 58:20.453
in writing a stupid book

58:20.584 --> 58:22.107
about some civilization
that nobody cares about it.

58:22.194 --> 58:23.717
And...

58:23.804 --> 58:24.675
- There's no point.

58:26.024 --> 58:27.808
- Yeah.

58:27.895 --> 58:28.374
- There's no point because
we're not going to make it.

58:28.505 --> 58:30.202
There's no point because I,

58:34.423 --> 58:36.077
I'm not going to be able to fix it.

58:37.383 --> 58:39.167
Then, why the fuck drag me up here?

58:39.254 --> 58:40.342
If you think my work is pointless.

58:40.429 --> 58:41.648
If you think that I am pointless.

58:41.779 --> 58:43.128
If you think that what
I'm doing is pointless.

58:43.215 --> 58:44.782
- No, no, no...

58:44.869 --> 58:45.913
- I'm pointless?

58:46.000 --> 58:46.653
- No!

58:46.784 --> 58:47.524
You're, you're...

58:47.611 --> 58:49.003
- You just said, it's pointless.

58:50.657 --> 58:52.398
- I just meant, it's
hard to rationalize

58:53.660 --> 58:55.575
me doing something so meaningless

58:55.662 --> 58:57.055
when you're doing
something so meaningful.

58:57.185 --> 58:57.795
- It's not what you've said.

58:57.882 --> 58:59.144
You said it's pointless.

58:59.231 --> 58:59.797
You said you didn't want to work on it

58:59.927 --> 59:01.189
because it's pointless,

59:01.276 --> 59:02.016
which means that you don't fucking

59:04.584 --> 59:05.890
think that I can do it.

59:08.545 --> 59:09.371
- You don't understand.

59:09.458 --> 59:10.547
- I do understand.

59:12.244 --> 59:14.420
- Babe.
- Don't.

59:14.507 --> 59:15.726
I need you to believe in me.

59:18.076 --> 59:19.251
And you don't.

59:21.427 --> 59:25.257
And on top of it, you're
fucking lying about it.

59:28.042 --> 59:28.913
Who are you?

59:31.350 --> 59:32.569
Why have you been lying about

59:34.440 --> 59:38.313
the copious amounts of time
you've been with Sammy?

59:40.359 --> 59:42.448
Tell me the truth,

59:43.667 --> 59:45.320
because I think that you owe me that.

59:49.194 --> 59:50.238
- Yeah.

59:57.898 --> 59:59.639
So something happened between Sammy and I.

59:59.726 --> 1:00:00.640
- Hmm hmm.

1:00:00.771 --> 1:00:03.034
- One time.
- Hmm hmm.

1:00:03.121 --> 1:00:04.731
- Earlier this year
and it was one night

1:00:04.862 --> 1:00:07.691
and it was completely
stupid and meaningless.

1:00:07.821 --> 1:00:10.258
And we do not feel that
way about each other.

1:00:11.259 --> 1:00:12.173
And I love you so much.

1:00:12.260 --> 1:00:13.435
- Fuck you.

1:00:13.522 --> 1:00:15.960
- And it was a
stupid, stupid thing

1:00:16.090 --> 1:00:17.614
and we both hated it and it was awful.

1:00:17.701 --> 1:00:19.050
- Fuck you.
- And it was one time.

1:00:19.137 --> 1:00:22.096
- You bring her into
my house where, when?

1:00:22.227 --> 1:00:23.707
- Their house, their house,
you guys were working late.

1:00:23.837 --> 1:00:26.535
You and Elliot were
working late, and...

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:27.798
When did this happen?

1:00:29.016 --> 1:00:29.626
- In February?

1:00:31.758 --> 1:00:33.630
It was February or March,
I don't remember exactly.

1:00:33.717 --> 1:00:34.369
- Hmm hmm.

1:00:36.676 --> 1:00:39.592
- No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

1:00:39.679 --> 1:00:41.072
Don't even go there.

1:00:41.159 --> 1:00:42.508
It's not, it's not that.

1:00:42.595 --> 1:00:45.076
Honey, you gotta believe me.

1:00:45.163 --> 1:00:46.120
Please.

1:00:46.207 --> 1:00:47.034
- Oh my God.
- No.

1:00:55.521 --> 1:00:56.914
- Well, congratulations, Jason.

1:00:57.044 --> 1:00:58.045
No.

1:00:58.132 --> 1:00:59.743
- What am I suppose to do?

1:01:03.442 --> 1:01:06.445
I can't believe...

1:01:06.532 --> 1:01:09.578
Don't!

1:01:09.709 --> 1:01:10.318
Don't!

1:01:12.930 --> 1:01:13.670
I...

1:01:16.368 --> 1:01:19.414
Fucking hate you.

1:01:19.545 --> 1:01:21.068
- Don't say that,
please, don't say that.

1:01:25.246 --> 1:01:26.117
- I don't!

1:01:42.002 --> 1:01:43.134
Fuck!

1:01:58.192 --> 1:02:00.064
- Did something happen?

1:02:01.326 --> 1:02:02.588
- I'm leaving you.

1:02:03.850 --> 1:02:05.417
That's what happened.

1:02:33.140 --> 1:02:34.838
- Can you open your
window, please, Jennifer?

1:02:36.970 --> 1:02:38.058
Hi, Jennifer.

1:02:38.189 --> 1:02:38.885
I'm Dr. Lakeland, you remember?

1:02:39.016 --> 1:02:39.799
We met yesterday.

1:02:39.886 --> 1:02:40.931
I'm the neurologist.

1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:43.585
I know, they're fine.

1:02:43.672 --> 1:02:44.935
They're going to stay right there, okay.

1:02:45.065 --> 1:02:47.111
So Jennifer, I need 10
minutes of your time, okay.

1:02:48.721 --> 1:02:50.592
And then I'm going to tell you
everything that's going on.

1:02:50.679 --> 1:02:51.550
- Now, is not a good time.

1:02:51.637 --> 1:02:53.030
- I know, it's not.

1:02:53.117 --> 1:02:55.902
Trust me, I know it's
not a good time for you.

1:02:55.989 --> 1:02:57.730
I know it's not and I need just 10 minutes

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:59.688
and I promise you, I'm gonna
explain everything to you.

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:01.603
So you and I need to go
back in your house, please.

1:03:01.690 --> 1:03:03.475
- I'm not going anywhere.

1:03:03.605 --> 1:03:04.519
Who are those people?

1:03:04.650 --> 1:03:05.433
- They're going to move,

1:03:05.520 --> 1:03:06.565
as soon as we go in the house,

1:03:06.652 --> 1:03:07.348
they're going to go.

1:03:09.002 --> 1:03:10.308
They're just helping me right now.

1:03:13.267 --> 1:03:14.703
I know, I know.

1:03:14.834 --> 1:03:15.835
And I know it's the worst possible time

1:03:15.922 --> 1:03:17.097
for me to be showing up
and doing this to you.

1:03:17.228 --> 1:03:18.707
- How do you know?
- I'm gonna tell-

1:03:18.795 --> 1:03:19.839
- What do you mean, you know?

1:03:19.926 --> 1:03:20.884
- I'm going to tell
you everything.

1:03:21.014 --> 1:03:22.668
I just want 10 minutes, okay, please.

1:03:22.755 --> 1:03:24.409
I'm trying to help you
save the world, okay.

1:03:24.496 --> 1:03:26.803
I need you to give me 10
minutes of your time, okay?

1:03:31.764 --> 1:03:33.026
Yeah, go in, okay.

1:03:38.118 --> 1:03:38.815
Okay.

1:03:40.468 --> 1:03:43.515
So, Jennifer, what I want you to do

1:03:43.602 --> 1:03:46.997
is walk me through what happened
in here with Jason, okay?

1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.348
Would it help you if he was in here?

1:03:54.439 --> 1:03:55.353
- Yes.

1:03:55.483 --> 1:03:56.658
- Okay. Okay.

1:03:58.182 --> 1:04:00.358
- Jason.
- Yeah.

1:04:00.488 --> 1:04:02.708
- Can you come in, please?
- Yep.

1:04:02.839 --> 1:04:05.537
- Okay, so, thank you so much.
- Yep.

1:04:05.667 --> 1:04:06.843
- Both of you, okay.

1:04:06.930 --> 1:04:08.105
Here's what we need you to do.
- Okay.

1:04:10.281 --> 1:04:12.849
- I'd like, you two,
please, to walk me through

1:04:13.980 --> 1:04:15.764
what happened.

1:04:15.852 --> 1:04:19.203
- She was there and I came in
with the water bottles and,

1:04:21.683 --> 1:04:23.598
I put hers here and, uh.

1:04:26.036 --> 1:04:28.429
I drank from mine and then I put it here.

1:04:30.518 --> 1:04:32.564
- And then he came over

1:04:32.694 --> 1:04:34.740
and told me that he was
fucking our best friend.

1:04:37.308 --> 1:04:38.048
So, that happened.

1:04:38.135 --> 1:04:39.397
Is that what you're looking for?

1:04:39.527 --> 1:04:41.138
- Yeah, okay.

1:04:41.225 --> 1:04:42.487
So how did you feel when he told you that?

1:04:49.537 --> 1:04:50.930
- How would you feel?

1:04:51.017 --> 1:04:51.757
- It doesn't matter
how I would feel.

1:04:51.888 --> 1:04:53.237
I want to know how you felt.

1:04:55.630 --> 1:04:57.110
- Like, I'm dying.

1:04:59.199 --> 1:04:59.896
Betrayed.

1:05:01.419 --> 1:05:04.117
And fucking angry and,

1:05:06.293 --> 1:05:10.080
heartbroken and I feel so stupid.

1:05:12.821 --> 1:05:14.562
I feel like an idiot for trusting you.

1:05:14.649 --> 1:05:16.477
I feel so stupid.

1:05:16.564 --> 1:05:17.783
I feel gutted.

1:05:20.177 --> 1:05:22.048
Like, I want to die,

1:05:22.179 --> 1:05:24.833
but like, I want you to die, more.

1:05:24.964 --> 1:05:26.574
And what did
you say to him after he told

1:05:26.661 --> 1:05:27.662
you, what did you say to him?

1:05:28.794 --> 1:05:30.230
- I went-
- Don't!

1:05:30.361 --> 1:05:32.189
- Please, please, just
let him do it, okay?

1:05:32.319 --> 1:05:32.972
Let him do it, please.

1:05:33.059 --> 1:05:34.495
- I went for you.

1:05:34.626 --> 1:05:35.801
- I don't even remember.

1:05:35.888 --> 1:05:39.413
I don't know, he came and then I left

1:05:39.500 --> 1:05:40.849
and I went to the bathroom

1:05:40.893 --> 1:05:43.591
and I collected my fucking
self because it was a moment.

1:05:43.722 --> 1:05:45.419
And then I went to the car

1:05:45.506 --> 1:05:47.856
and then you showed up with
whatever bullshit this is.

1:05:47.987 --> 1:05:49.249
That's what happened.

1:05:49.380 --> 1:05:50.729
- Okay, we're going
to do that, okay.

1:05:54.559 --> 1:05:55.821
Okay, you can do this.

1:05:55.908 --> 1:05:57.301
So tell me what you did
when you came in here.

1:06:01.087 --> 1:06:03.568
- I closed the door.

1:06:03.655 --> 1:06:04.264
- And did you close it?

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:05.700
How did you close it?

1:06:10.662 --> 1:06:12.446
What did you do next, Jennifer?

1:06:12.577 --> 1:06:13.186
- I grabbed,

1:06:14.318 --> 1:06:15.145
I don't know.

1:06:15.232 --> 1:06:16.146
I actually don't remember.

1:06:17.147 --> 1:06:18.191
I slammed something.

1:06:18.278 --> 1:06:20.237
Maybe like, I don't remember.

1:06:20.324 --> 1:06:21.673
Do you
remember what you were feeling?

1:06:22.630 --> 1:06:23.849
- Yes.

1:06:23.936 --> 1:06:24.937
I don't remember what I did.

1:06:25.024 --> 1:06:26.678
I don't understand what's going on.

1:06:26.808 --> 1:06:28.071
I don't remember what happened.

1:06:28.158 --> 1:06:30.073
I know the feeling if that's
what you're asking me.

1:06:30.203 --> 1:06:31.465
That's what I'm asking you.

1:06:32.901 --> 1:06:33.772
- The feeling?
- Yeah?

1:06:33.902 --> 1:06:35.165
We're going to stop this, okay.

1:06:36.122 --> 1:06:36.862
Frank?

1:06:37.819 --> 1:06:40.213
You can come in, now.

1:06:40.344 --> 1:06:40.997
- What?

1:06:48.526 --> 1:06:49.179
- Dr. Lakeland.

1:06:50.397 --> 1:06:51.746
- Come on, sit
down, please, Frank.

1:06:51.833 --> 1:06:52.530
- Jennifer.

1:06:54.662 --> 1:06:56.447
- So, Jennifer,

1:06:56.534 --> 1:06:58.884
I'm going to tell you
what's been going on, okay.

1:06:59.015 --> 1:06:59.972
I want you to listen to me.

1:07:00.103 --> 1:07:00.799
And when you have questions, of course,

1:07:00.886 --> 1:07:01.887
you're going to have questions

1:07:02.018 --> 1:07:03.758
and Frank and I,

1:07:03.889 --> 1:07:05.978
we're going to try to answer
them as best we can, okay.

1:07:06.109 --> 1:07:08.198
So, do you remember when
you woke up yesterday

1:07:08.285 --> 1:07:09.938
and I told you,

1:07:10.069 --> 1:07:12.506
you were suffering from
acute dissociative amnesia?

1:07:12.637 --> 1:07:14.465
Okay, so you had had a,

1:07:14.552 --> 1:07:17.337
like a stress-induced blackout

1:07:17.468 --> 1:07:20.340
and you forgot about two days of your life.

1:07:20.471 --> 1:07:22.864
So here's what happened
in those two days.

1:07:22.951 --> 1:07:24.997
You came to this house with Jason.

1:07:25.084 --> 1:07:27.043
You had a lovely day together.

1:07:27.130 --> 1:07:28.261
You had a lovely night.

1:07:29.567 --> 1:07:31.743
The next day you went to the market

1:07:31.830 --> 1:07:33.005
and then your friends came over for dinner,

1:07:33.136 --> 1:07:34.920
Samantha and Elliot came over for dinner.

1:07:36.443 --> 1:07:39.881
They left and you and Jason went upstairs.

1:07:40.839 --> 1:07:41.579
Then you had a fight.

1:07:44.190 --> 1:07:46.932
You went into the loo by yourself.

1:07:47.019 --> 1:07:48.064
And while you were in there,

1:07:49.239 --> 1:07:51.241
you had an epiphany
about the water crisis.

1:07:52.677 --> 1:07:54.374
We know this

1:07:54.505 --> 1:07:56.289
because when you left,

1:07:56.376 --> 1:07:58.813
you got in your car and you called Frank

1:07:58.900 --> 1:08:00.119
and you left him a message.

1:08:00.250 --> 1:08:01.903
And you told him that you had solved it,

1:08:01.990 --> 1:08:03.383
that you had figured it out.

1:08:03.470 --> 1:08:05.255
And you wanted him to
get your team together.

1:08:05.342 --> 1:08:07.126
- No.
- Yes.

1:08:07.213 --> 1:08:08.519
We don't know exactly
what happened after that

1:08:08.606 --> 1:08:10.782
but you were found unconscious

1:08:10.912 --> 1:08:12.610
but unhurt on the side of the road.

1:08:15.482 --> 1:08:17.441
Welcome back.

1:08:17.571 --> 1:08:19.617
- Why are you here?

1:08:19.747 --> 1:08:21.227
- What's the last
thing you remember?

1:08:22.228 --> 1:08:23.534
- I was at the office

1:08:23.621 --> 1:08:27.277
and I ran downstairs to do some lunch.

1:08:28.756 --> 1:08:29.844
Had a hamburger.

1:08:30.715 --> 1:08:31.759
- That's it?

1:08:32.934 --> 1:08:33.631
- And a hash brown.

1:08:34.980 --> 1:08:36.024
- It was clear to Frank

1:08:36.112 --> 1:08:38.418
that you did not remember calling him.

1:08:38.549 --> 1:08:40.855
You did not remember having that epiphany.

1:08:40.986 --> 1:08:42.988
And you did not remember
that whole weekend.

1:08:43.075 --> 1:08:44.598
So here's what happened, okay.

1:08:44.685 --> 1:08:47.166
You were medically sedated, safely.

1:08:48.298 --> 1:08:49.734
And Frank called me.

1:08:54.173 --> 1:08:56.044
Hello?
- Dr. Rebecca Lakeland?

1:08:56.132 --> 1:08:58.569
Right now there's a team waiting
for you outside your door

1:08:58.656 --> 1:09:00.179
with our verification documents.

1:09:00.310 --> 1:09:01.528
Take you to Auckland Airport

1:09:01.615 --> 1:09:03.791
and put you on a plane to come here.

1:09:03.878 --> 1:09:05.141
- I'm a memory specialist

1:09:05.271 --> 1:09:08.709
and the work that I do is
around context dependent memory.

1:09:08.840 --> 1:09:12.409
The context or the
situation that you're in,

1:09:12.496 --> 1:09:14.541
when a memory is formed,

1:09:14.672 --> 1:09:17.457
that impacts the way that
that memory is retrieved.

1:09:17.588 --> 1:09:19.242
So I'm going to interview.

1:09:19.329 --> 1:09:20.852
I'm going to ask each of
you questions individually,

1:09:20.982 --> 1:09:23.768
and I want you to think
in terms of senses, okay.

1:09:23.855 --> 1:09:24.769
So go through, what did it smell like?

1:09:24.899 --> 1:09:26.336
What did it tastes like?

1:09:26.423 --> 1:09:27.032
What did it sound like?

1:09:27.163 --> 1:09:28.860
All those things.

1:09:28.947 --> 1:09:32.820
And also in terms of physical
or emotional state, okay.

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:33.995
So what were you feeling?

1:09:34.082 --> 1:09:35.432
What was Jennifer feeling?

1:09:35.519 --> 1:09:37.303
Okay, the fascinating thing
about this kind of work

1:09:37.434 --> 1:09:39.305
is that a person moving
through this sort of thing,

1:09:39.392 --> 1:09:42.439
70% of the time, they're
going to repeat the behavior.

1:09:42.569 --> 1:09:44.397
And if you feel her going off,

1:09:44.484 --> 1:09:46.965
that's where you sort
of, as a group, you know,

1:09:47.052 --> 1:09:47.966
you get her back on.

1:09:48.053 --> 1:09:49.707
Okay, so can you walk me through

1:09:49.837 --> 1:09:51.665
what happened when Jennifer
came into the office?

1:09:51.796 --> 1:09:55.278
- I just knew that she
needed some time off.

1:09:55.408 --> 1:09:56.931
This isn't a request.

1:09:57.062 --> 1:09:59.543
- You and Sam are going
to come to dinner.

1:09:59.673 --> 1:10:03.547
- We will go over dinner if
buddy makes Colombian food.

1:10:03.677 --> 1:10:06.027
You're going up there just
to kind of be buffered.

1:10:06.114 --> 1:10:07.855
- There's a piece of art,

1:10:07.942 --> 1:10:09.901
a statue that's by the front door.

1:10:10.031 --> 1:10:11.424
- You moved this.

1:10:11.511 --> 1:10:13.034
- She kind of pretended
like she was okay with it,

1:10:13.121 --> 1:10:14.732
but I could tell that she was not.

1:10:14.862 --> 1:10:16.429
Okay, and
you said she was surprised to

1:10:16.516 --> 1:10:18.126
know that you had learned the ukulele.

1:10:18.257 --> 1:10:19.519
- You're sitting
here on the couch

1:10:19.650 --> 1:10:22.522
and you're just sort of
performing for the whole house.

1:10:22.653 --> 1:10:23.697
Do you want a standing ovation?

1:10:23.828 --> 1:10:24.872
It's lovely.

1:10:25.003 --> 1:10:26.309
Good job.

1:10:26.439 --> 1:10:27.919
- I think we had
lunch after that.

1:10:28.049 --> 1:10:31.444
I think there was turkey
sandwich with mayo and mustard.

1:10:31.531 --> 1:10:33.359
Yeah, so then we went for a canoe ride.

1:10:34.926 --> 1:10:36.493
We were having trouble
finding the rhythm.

1:10:36.580 --> 1:10:37.885
It was a bit awkward.

1:10:37.972 --> 1:10:39.322
I'm not afraid of drowning in it.

1:10:39.409 --> 1:10:42.934
I just don't want to fall into
it and get all wet and cold.

1:10:43.064 --> 1:10:44.370
We made a stir fry.

1:10:44.501 --> 1:10:45.980
And we have a routine
when we make the stir fry

1:10:46.067 --> 1:10:48.287
and it's like a dance, almost.

1:10:48.374 --> 1:10:50.942
She fed me a piece of red pepper.

1:10:51.072 --> 1:10:53.118
Is she going to do that again?

1:10:53.205 --> 1:10:54.337
Maybe, I hope so, I hope so.

1:10:54.424 --> 1:10:56.252
I hope so that she has the same impulses.

1:10:56.339 --> 1:10:57.688
- That'll be wild.
- Yeah.

1:10:57.775 --> 1:10:59.037
- I knocked her
water bottle over

1:10:59.124 --> 1:11:00.517
and before she could stop me,

1:11:00.647 --> 1:11:02.910
I opened it up and I dumped my water out.

1:11:03.041 --> 1:11:05.043
We made up a song.

1:11:05.913 --> 1:11:07.828
- What is this?

1:11:07.959 --> 1:11:11.702
- So we had an intimate
moment, on the swing.

1:11:11.789 --> 1:11:13.747
She grabbed me and kissed me.
- Okay.

1:11:14.835 --> 1:11:16.141
- This I remember,

1:11:16.359 --> 1:11:18.404
because this hasn't
happened in a long time.

1:11:18.491 --> 1:11:20.058
So in the morning, I got up before she did.

1:11:20.145 --> 1:11:21.581
Okay.

1:11:21.712 --> 1:11:24.367
- And I went downstairs and
I made her a cup of coffee

1:11:24.454 --> 1:11:27.761
and we like to do a canoe,
a paddle before we eat.

1:11:27.892 --> 1:11:29.110
And the water was amazing.

1:11:29.197 --> 1:11:30.460
It was a nice morning?

1:11:30.590 --> 1:11:32.375
Yeah, it was a nice morning.

1:11:32.505 --> 1:11:33.637
Okay.

1:11:33.767 --> 1:11:34.072
- Went to the farmer's market.
- Yep.

1:11:34.159 --> 1:11:35.073
- Get the pie?

1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:36.117
- I did.

1:11:36.204 --> 1:11:37.380
- It was an apple crumble

1:11:37.510 --> 1:11:39.295
with the caramel like drizzled.

1:11:39.382 --> 1:11:40.644
Hammock time.

1:11:40.774 --> 1:11:42.080
And she was reading.

1:11:42.210 --> 1:11:43.734
Well, then we started
getting ready for dinner.

1:11:43.821 --> 1:11:47.128
Pulled up in the
back of their farmhouse.

1:11:47.215 --> 1:11:49.870
I remember that Jennifer
went to Samantha first

1:11:49.957 --> 1:11:50.915
and said, hi.

1:11:51.002 --> 1:11:52.003
- She was really happy.

1:11:53.091 --> 1:11:54.353
Really happy to see me.

1:11:54.440 --> 1:11:55.963
Jennifer and
Elliot went for a walk

1:11:56.094 --> 1:11:57.443
to discuss work, I assume.

1:11:57.574 --> 1:11:58.966
Do you
remember the route you took?

1:11:59.053 --> 1:12:00.403
- Yeah, we were
over by the fence.

1:12:00.533 --> 1:12:01.360
Do you remember exactly

1:12:01.447 --> 1:12:02.927
what you were saying to her?

1:12:03.014 --> 1:12:04.363
- Are you sure?

1:12:04.450 --> 1:12:05.364
Is it okay to talk about this, really?

1:12:05.451 --> 1:12:07.105
I don't know if you know this, but,

1:12:07.192 --> 1:12:08.889
she had a miscarriage.

1:12:08.976 --> 1:12:10.500
- Yes.

1:12:10.630 --> 1:12:11.588
Jason didn't
mention that to you?

1:12:11.718 --> 1:12:13.154
No he didn't.

1:12:13.241 --> 1:12:14.591
No, no, but we're just sort
of walking through events.

1:12:14.678 --> 1:12:16.288
So if it didn't come up with him, you know,

1:12:16.419 --> 1:12:18.116
it wasn't a thing that would
have walked me through.

1:12:18.203 --> 1:12:19.857
- Right.

1:12:19.987 --> 1:12:21.380
And what
did you talk about at dinner?

1:12:21.467 --> 1:12:23.948
- Normally, it's served
single serving platters,

1:12:24.035 --> 1:12:24.818
as opposed to

1:12:26.994 --> 1:12:27.995
Ponderosa style.

1:12:29.562 --> 1:12:30.824
- Families.
- That's true.

1:12:30.955 --> 1:12:32.130
- He's not wrong.
- He's not wrong.

1:12:32.260 --> 1:12:33.392
- We criticize
each other's meals.

1:12:33.479 --> 1:12:35.438
It's kind of a friendly
competition thing.

1:12:35.525 --> 1:12:37.353
You can only find out so
much on Wikipedia, right?

1:12:37.440 --> 1:12:39.137
So that's where we were.
- Wow.

1:12:39.267 --> 1:12:40.094
- It was all in
good fun, you know.

1:12:40.225 --> 1:12:41.705
Just teasing each other.

1:12:41.835 --> 1:12:46.449
- I still think it's crazy
that the two of you dated.

1:12:46.579 --> 1:12:48.233
- Jennifer, for whatever reason,

1:12:48.320 --> 1:12:52.672
loves the story about the not
date that Jason and I had.

1:12:52.803 --> 1:12:55.153
- It was the most awkward kiss.

1:12:55.240 --> 1:12:57.198
It was gross, actually.

1:12:57.285 --> 1:12:58.678
- It was gross?
- Yes, it was.

1:12:58.809 --> 1:13:00.419
- Oh, thanks.

1:13:00.506 --> 1:13:01.159
And after
dinner, we played croquet.

1:13:01.246 --> 1:13:02.813
It was fun, but Elliot,

1:13:02.900 --> 1:13:04.423
he ate too much watermelon.
- Okay.

1:13:05.816 --> 1:13:07.644
Ah, fuck it.

1:13:07.731 --> 1:13:08.601
I always bring a watermelon.

1:13:08.688 --> 1:13:11.082
It's a special treat.
- Yeah, great.

1:13:11.212 --> 1:13:12.170
- Don't do that all the time.

1:13:12.300 --> 1:13:13.998
- And then we went back
inside to play a game.

1:13:14.128 --> 1:13:15.608
Favorite smell.

1:13:15.695 --> 1:13:17.828
My answers are never straightforward,

1:13:17.915 --> 1:13:19.351
which Jason knows.

1:13:19.482 --> 1:13:20.178
So Sammy knew more about you

1:13:20.265 --> 1:13:21.484
than Jennifer knew about you?

1:13:21.571 --> 1:13:23.660
- In this particular
instance, yes.

1:13:23.747 --> 1:13:25.749
And so how
did Jennifer feel about that?

1:13:27.054 --> 1:13:28.404
- She didn't like that.

1:13:28.491 --> 1:13:29.709
Kind of highlighted that we haven't

1:13:29.840 --> 1:13:31.145
been spending a lot of time together

1:13:31.276 --> 1:13:32.320
and it made her feel uncomfortable

1:13:32.451 --> 1:13:35.672
and suspicious and jealous.
- Okay.

1:13:35.802 --> 1:13:37.151
- It got weird.

1:13:37.238 --> 1:13:38.675
- Yeah, time to go.

1:13:38.805 --> 1:13:39.632
So, she stormed in the house

1:13:39.719 --> 1:13:40.241
and went up to the bedroom?

1:13:40.372 --> 1:13:41.591
- She was packing.

1:13:41.678 --> 1:13:43.375
We had a fight.

1:13:43.506 --> 1:13:45.072
You're the scientist that
they plucked from obscurity

1:13:45.203 --> 1:13:46.291
to fix everything.

1:13:46.422 --> 1:13:47.945
- But I can and I will and I-

1:13:48.075 --> 1:13:50.295
- I don't want you
to save this world.

1:13:50.382 --> 1:13:52.863
My world is lonely and sad and useless.

1:13:52.950 --> 1:13:55.343
- Get away from me!

1:13:55.431 --> 1:13:58.303
- She asked me if
anything had happened

1:13:58.434 --> 1:13:59.086
between me and Sam.

1:13:59.217 --> 1:14:00.479
We had sex one time-

1:14:00.566 --> 1:14:01.262
- Fuck you.

1:14:01.393 --> 1:14:02.699
- And I told her the truth.

1:14:02.786 --> 1:14:04.527
It was a stupid mistake.

1:14:04.614 --> 1:14:06.398
And if you want to make it all
about that, then go for it.

1:14:06.529 --> 1:14:08.269
- I don't understand the point!

1:14:08.356 --> 1:14:09.401
I don't understand how you could do this!

1:14:09.488 --> 1:14:11.011
- You betrayed me first!

1:14:11.142 --> 1:14:12.926
You gave up on this marriage!

1:14:13.013 --> 1:14:15.015
You gave up on this friendship!

1:14:15.146 --> 1:14:16.756
You gave up on this whole thing!

1:14:16.887 --> 1:14:18.279
- I hate you.

1:14:19.106 --> 1:14:20.717
- Yeah, that's obvious.

1:14:20.804 --> 1:14:22.327
You've hated me for a very long time.

1:14:22.414 --> 1:14:23.981
- If you made mistakes
in that fight,

1:14:24.111 --> 1:14:25.678
if you said things you
wish you hadn't said,

1:14:25.765 --> 1:14:28.333
you gotta do it all like that, okay?

1:14:28.420 --> 1:14:29.465
- That's-
- You can't fix it.

1:14:30.770 --> 1:14:31.771
So if you feel like you've fucked up-

1:14:31.902 --> 1:14:33.294
- That sucks.
- No, it does.

1:14:33.381 --> 1:14:36.167
I know, but it's important
that it stays there, okay.

1:14:37.385 --> 1:14:39.170
How long was she in there?

1:14:39.300 --> 1:14:41.607
Not long, maybe 30 seconds.

1:14:41.738 --> 1:14:42.869
And then she stormed down the stairs

1:14:42.956 --> 1:14:44.610
and that was the last time I saw her.

1:14:44.741 --> 1:14:47.091
- And then I got this call.

1:14:47.178 --> 1:14:48.396
- Get the team together

1:14:48.527 --> 1:14:51.182
and meet me at the office in 45 minutes.

1:14:52.575 --> 1:14:54.054
I figured it out, Frank, I-

1:14:56.143 --> 1:14:57.667
- Here we are.

1:14:57.797 --> 1:14:58.972
- The next thing
that's going to happen

1:14:59.059 --> 1:15:00.800
is we're going to wake Jennifer up.

1:15:00.931 --> 1:15:02.323
Jason and I are going to be there.

1:15:02.410 --> 1:15:04.543
And based on her reaction,

1:15:04.674 --> 1:15:06.414
I'm going to decide

1:15:06.545 --> 1:15:08.634
whether or not we actually
go ahead with this, okay?

1:15:08.765 --> 1:15:10.636
If we go ahead, you're
going to be contacted.

1:15:13.334 --> 1:15:16.076
So what we have been doing

1:15:16.163 --> 1:15:18.688
and what you have been
experiencing for the last two days

1:15:20.385 --> 1:15:24.302
is a reconstruction of
those days that you lost.

1:15:24.389 --> 1:15:28.175
And we did that because our hope

1:15:28.262 --> 1:15:30.830
is that by moving you through that again,

1:15:30.961 --> 1:15:32.658
you would come to the same discovery.

1:15:32.789 --> 1:15:34.399
You would have that epiphany.
- Stop.

1:15:34.530 --> 1:15:35.400
And you would to remember.
- Stop.

1:15:35.531 --> 1:15:37.445
- That didn't happen, okay?
- Stop.

1:15:37.576 --> 1:15:38.229
- Yeah.

1:15:46.585 --> 1:15:47.760
- So you sent me here

1:15:50.154 --> 1:15:51.111
to put on a play?

1:15:53.331 --> 1:15:55.202
That's what you're telling me?

1:15:55.333 --> 1:15:57.553
That none of this was real?

1:15:57.640 --> 1:16:00.556
That 15 minutes ago didn't happen?

1:16:02.209 --> 1:16:02.906
That...

1:16:05.212 --> 1:16:06.866
You recreated this?

1:16:06.997 --> 1:16:08.564
- We didn't have a choice.

1:16:08.694 --> 1:16:10.783
You didn't have a choice?

1:16:10.870 --> 1:16:12.611
- We wanted you to
have the same thought

1:16:12.698 --> 1:16:15.614
and we wanted that to happen
as organically as possible.

1:16:15.701 --> 1:16:17.398
- How am I supposed to get
this out of my fucking head,

1:16:17.485 --> 1:16:18.530
what just happened to me?

1:16:18.617 --> 1:16:20.227
- It's okay, it's okay.

1:16:20.314 --> 1:16:22.490
You don't have to do
anything right now, okay?

1:16:22.621 --> 1:16:24.492
So can I tell you one more thing?

1:16:24.623 --> 1:16:26.233
- I don't care what
you want me to know.

1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:28.192
I don't care, I don't care, I don't care.

1:16:28.279 --> 1:16:29.802
This is so fucked up.

1:16:29.889 --> 1:16:32.196
You have no idea how fucked up this is.

1:16:32.283 --> 1:16:33.763
- No-

1:16:33.893 --> 1:16:34.285
- I don't
know what's in my head!

1:16:34.372 --> 1:16:35.112
- I know, you don't.

1:16:35.199 --> 1:16:36.287
I know you don't.

1:16:36.417 --> 1:16:37.723
But it is in there

1:16:37.854 --> 1:16:38.463
and we're going to help you get it out.

1:16:38.594 --> 1:16:40.160
- So what now?

1:16:40.291 --> 1:16:41.553
- This is what we're
going to figure out, okay?

1:16:41.684 --> 1:16:43.120
We are not going to do it right now.

1:16:43.250 --> 1:16:46.079
- You can take some time.

1:16:46.210 --> 1:16:47.777
Process all this.

1:16:49.430 --> 1:16:50.606
- You want to help me?

1:16:51.432 --> 1:16:52.695
- Yep.

1:16:52.825 --> 1:16:54.218
I do.

1:16:54.305 --> 1:16:55.523
- If you wanted to help me,

1:16:55.654 --> 1:16:57.917
you would have said
something in the first place.

1:16:58.048 --> 1:16:59.440
If you wanted to help me,

1:16:59.527 --> 1:17:00.616
you wouldn't have done...

1:17:02.922 --> 1:17:05.185
All of you can go fuck yourselves.

1:17:58.282 --> 1:17:59.718
- Okay, so I just
got off the phone

1:17:59.849 --> 1:18:01.459
with the best hypnotherapy
therapist around

1:18:01.589 --> 1:18:03.200
and she can be here in the morning.

1:18:03.330 --> 1:18:05.419
I think that is probably our
best bet now to go that route.

1:18:07.334 --> 1:18:10.120
- Hypnotherapy has been known
to implant false information.

1:18:10.207 --> 1:18:10.990
I can't trust it.

1:18:11.121 --> 1:18:12.339
- No, that's not going to happen

1:18:12.426 --> 1:18:13.819
with the hypnotherapy
therapist that I've got

1:18:13.950 --> 1:18:16.343
but I feel like you probably
have another idea, right?

1:18:16.474 --> 1:18:18.911
So what's your plan?

1:18:24.438 --> 1:18:25.875
Cytidol.

1:18:26.832 --> 1:18:28.138
- What?

1:18:28.225 --> 1:18:28.921
What is that?

1:18:30.618 --> 1:18:32.011
- You wouldn't know,
it's classified,

1:18:32.098 --> 1:18:35.145
but it's been known to
work in 90% of cases.

1:18:38.757 --> 1:18:40.585
- So, what have we been doing?

1:18:40.672 --> 1:18:43.022
Why'd you bring me here, 90%?

1:18:43.153 --> 1:18:45.111
Why didn't you just do
that in the first place?

1:18:45.198 --> 1:18:48.071
- Because 75% of
cases end up catatonic

1:18:48.201 --> 1:18:50.160
after successful extraction.

1:18:52.989 --> 1:18:54.642
- So what happens if
you're not successful?

1:18:54.773 --> 1:18:57.645
And then also now, Jennifer's catatonic?

1:18:57.733 --> 1:19:00.779
So you've just taken
the most important brain

1:19:00.866 --> 1:19:01.824
on the whole planet right now.

1:19:01.954 --> 1:19:03.347
And you've destroyed it.

1:19:03.477 --> 1:19:05.305
- There's something else.

1:19:05.436 --> 1:19:08.656
We've told everyone, they have five years.

1:19:08.787 --> 1:19:11.442
The truth is, it's less than that.

1:19:13.009 --> 1:19:13.923
A lot less.

1:19:19.798 --> 1:19:21.582
- Jesus Christ.

1:19:45.824 --> 1:19:47.478
- Yeah, I understand.

1:19:50.611 --> 1:19:51.438
I don't know.

1:19:54.354 --> 1:19:55.355
No, I don't know.

1:20:00.404 --> 1:20:00.926
How long?

1:20:03.320 --> 1:20:04.669
Uh, I'm going to call you back.

1:20:06.497 --> 1:20:07.454
- Hi.
- Hey.

1:20:09.065 --> 1:20:10.544
Can I come in?
- Yeah.

1:20:22.034 --> 1:20:23.819
- So how long have
we known each other?

1:20:25.342 --> 1:20:26.647
- Almost two years.

1:20:26.734 --> 1:20:28.562
- Well, after
getting to know you

1:20:28.649 --> 1:20:31.000
over the last couple years,

1:20:33.654 --> 1:20:36.657
I realized that you

1:20:36.744 --> 1:20:39.051
never ask anyone to do anything

1:20:41.140 --> 1:20:42.925
outside of their comfort zone,

1:20:43.012 --> 1:20:46.319
unless you think it's really necessary.

1:20:46.406 --> 1:20:48.669
And while what you did
to me was fucked up,

1:20:50.889 --> 1:20:51.934
I recognize that you thought

1:20:52.064 --> 1:20:53.413
it was absolutely necessary, so.

1:20:56.416 --> 1:20:57.069
I'm here.

1:20:59.680 --> 1:21:00.725
And I want to help you.

1:21:00.856 --> 1:21:01.857
I want to do whatever

1:21:03.162 --> 1:21:04.424
it is you need me to do.

1:21:08.211 --> 1:21:10.604
- Well, we have to go
to the next option.

1:21:13.129 --> 1:21:13.738
- Which is?

1:21:15.783 --> 1:21:19.918
- There is a drug
that's classified.

1:21:21.311 --> 1:21:22.616
It's called Cytidol.

1:21:37.196 --> 1:21:37.893
- Okay.

1:21:43.724 --> 1:21:44.900
What happens if I say no?

1:21:49.513 --> 1:21:50.253
- You can't.

1:21:53.386 --> 1:21:54.083
- Frank.

1:21:55.606 --> 1:21:58.783
- You have information
locked in your brain

1:21:59.958 --> 1:22:01.742
that could save the human race.

1:22:03.005 --> 1:22:05.616
If we don't get it in 18
months, we're all gone.

1:22:11.143 --> 1:22:12.666
- When is this
supposed to happen?

1:22:15.931 --> 1:22:18.890
- They authorized me
to give you 24 hours

1:22:18.977 --> 1:22:20.413
to get your affairs in order.

1:22:28.552 --> 1:22:30.597
- 24 hours?

1:22:38.475 --> 1:22:39.171
Thank you.

1:22:57.276 --> 1:22:57.973
- Hey.

1:23:02.499 --> 1:23:04.153
So what are you going to do?

1:23:06.807 --> 1:23:08.809
I don't know.

1:23:10.072 --> 1:23:12.335
I think you do.

1:23:13.858 --> 1:23:15.512
- I feel like I haven't
been home in 20 years.

1:23:17.514 --> 1:23:18.515
- Yeah, me too.

1:23:24.390 --> 1:23:26.175
- Actually, that's not
true 'cause I feel like

1:23:28.046 --> 1:23:29.134
work is my home.

1:23:32.746 --> 1:23:33.834
- Hmm hmm.

1:23:38.926 --> 1:23:41.233
- And the one constant
thing about that has been,

1:23:43.496 --> 1:23:44.019
um...

1:23:48.632 --> 1:23:49.372
You.

1:23:53.245 --> 1:23:55.856
I need you to promise me

1:23:55.943 --> 1:23:58.598
that you are going to go off and be happy

1:24:00.165 --> 1:24:01.819
with your wife and your new baby.

1:24:01.949 --> 1:24:04.909
And live a very happy life
because you owe that to me.

1:24:15.180 --> 1:24:16.616
You're not promising.

1:24:16.703 --> 1:24:17.922
- I promise.

1:24:18.053 --> 1:24:18.705
- Thank you.

1:24:25.234 --> 1:24:26.061
I have to go.

1:24:30.108 --> 1:24:31.718
I want you to finish up.

1:24:34.895 --> 1:24:36.114
Don't fuck it up.

1:25:18.417 --> 1:25:19.984
- I don't want to bother
telling you how ashamed I am

1:25:20.071 --> 1:25:21.768
because I think that's really obvious.

1:25:24.380 --> 1:25:26.773
And this might be the weirdest thing to say

1:25:26.860 --> 1:25:29.167
but this had nothing to do with you.

1:25:32.431 --> 1:25:34.259
I've just been alone
for a really long time.

1:25:36.043 --> 1:25:37.654
It's no excuse, but it's the truth.

1:25:39.830 --> 1:25:41.788
I can see how you were lonely.

1:25:43.181 --> 1:25:46.706
And I can see how Jason was lonely.

1:25:49.056 --> 1:25:51.146
- The worst part about this is,

1:25:51.233 --> 1:25:52.669
I think I betrayed you the most

1:25:54.932 --> 1:25:58.718
and I wouldn't dream of
asking you to forgive me.

1:25:58.805 --> 1:26:00.590
More than anything,

1:26:00.677 --> 1:26:01.721
I hope you can find it in
your heart to forgive him.

1:26:03.984 --> 1:26:05.943
You're his whole world.

1:26:06.030 --> 1:26:07.727
He loves you more than anything.

1:26:10.034 --> 1:26:11.992
- I think the thing that
has come out of all of this

1:26:12.079 --> 1:26:13.429
is that I realized

1:26:13.516 --> 1:26:15.648
that there are so many
different ways to love.

1:26:16.823 --> 1:26:18.216
You have hope.

1:26:21.176 --> 1:26:22.220
With or without me.

1:26:23.613 --> 1:26:25.397
Just know that I want you to be happy.

1:26:28.095 --> 1:26:29.706
And I'll see you on the other side.

1:26:35.799 --> 1:26:37.540
I miss you already.

1:26:55.688 --> 1:26:56.428
Hi.

1:26:57.516 --> 1:26:58.213
- Hey.

1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:09.224
They told me,

1:27:11.051 --> 1:27:12.618
they told me I couldn't call you.

1:27:12.705 --> 1:27:14.881
So I didn't call.

1:27:15.012 --> 1:27:15.621
- I know.

1:27:24.848 --> 1:27:25.892
- I'm...

1:27:30.070 --> 1:27:31.246
I'm really sorry about

1:27:33.030 --> 1:27:33.987
all of this.

1:27:35.685 --> 1:27:36.425
- I know.

1:27:41.038 --> 1:27:42.257
I don't have a lot of time.

1:27:50.134 --> 1:27:51.831
Last year when I was in the hospital,

1:27:53.137 --> 1:27:55.922
when I called you

1:27:58.360 --> 1:28:00.405
and I told you that I
had had a miscarriage,

1:28:02.581 --> 1:28:03.452
I was...

1:28:08.326 --> 1:28:11.808
I didn't have a miscarriage, Jason.

1:28:15.594 --> 1:28:17.857
We didn't have a miscarriage.

1:28:28.303 --> 1:28:30.870
I had to make a choice.

1:28:33.133 --> 1:28:34.091
I couldn't do both.

1:28:34.178 --> 1:28:35.658
I couldn't be a mother

1:28:37.268 --> 1:28:40.010
and then do what I was expected to do.

1:28:40.140 --> 1:28:44.014
So I made a choice
and I chose and I...

1:28:44.144 --> 1:28:44.797
And I'm sorry.

1:28:53.850 --> 1:28:54.546
Please.

1:29:12.782 --> 1:29:13.435
No.

1:29:19.005 --> 1:29:19.702
- You...

1:29:21.965 --> 1:29:22.922
- I remember.

1:29:25.055 --> 1:29:26.056
- Jenn.

1:29:27.057 --> 1:29:29.233
Jenn, you have to go.

1:29:29.320 --> 1:29:31.061
- No, no, no, no,
I'm not leaving.

1:29:34.499 --> 1:29:35.935
- I'll follow you.
