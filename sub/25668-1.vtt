00:31.466 --> 00:33.816
Deep in the concrete canyons
of Harlem, New York

00:33.990 --> 00:35.774
stands a basketball court

00:35.948 --> 00:38.734
where the legends of
the game are born.

00:38.908 --> 00:40.475
Rucker Park.

00:40.649 --> 00:42.955
Between the lines of
this battleground,

00:43.130 --> 00:46.046
a great many tales of
warriors have come and gone.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.960
But there was one player

00:48.135 --> 00:50.833
whose talent soared
far above the rest.

00:51.007 --> 00:53.575
His name, Uncle Drew.

00:54.750 --> 00:56.186
- So good.
- Incredible.

00:56.360 --> 00:57.405
Like, scary good.

00:57.579 --> 00:59.189
- Dominating.
- Dangerous.

00:59.363 --> 01:01.104
- Best of the best.
- Bananas.

01:01.278 --> 01:03.039
I mean, you knew he just
brought things to the game

01:03.063 --> 01:04.498
that the game had
never seen before.

01:04.673 --> 01:05.913
Changed the face of basketball.

01:06.022 --> 01:07.632
Drew been dangerous since birth.

01:07.806 --> 01:10.418
My pops played him one-on-one
in the seventh grade.

01:10.592 --> 01:12.550
He broke my pop's ankle.

01:14.248 --> 01:15.814
True story. Gym teacher
gave him a "D."

01:15.988 --> 01:17.348
You know, he'll
show you one trick,

01:17.468 --> 01:19.209
then beat you with
another trick.

01:19.383 --> 01:21.664
Shakin' people's sneakers off.
They fallin' out the trees.

01:24.693 --> 01:25.868
He was a bad man.

01:26.042 --> 01:26.869
He went to one end of the court,

01:27.043 --> 01:28.305
shot the lights out,

01:28.479 --> 01:29.674
went to the other
end of the court,

01:29.698 --> 01:31.047
shot it back on again.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.744
Man, he was good
enough to be the logo.

01:32.918 --> 01:34.616
Wait, I thought you
were the NBA logo.

01:34.790 --> 01:37.271
It's actually Uncle Drew. They
just shaved his afro off.

01:38.881 --> 01:40.491
One time, he took
on "The Destroyer"

01:40.665 --> 01:42.493
and beat him only
with his left hand.

01:42.667 --> 01:44.408
And then, hold on. Wait for it.

01:44.582 --> 01:47.411
With his right hand, he was
eating a ham sandwich.

01:47.585 --> 01:51.894
Was there anyone out there
better than Uncle Drew?

01:52.068 --> 01:53.852
With word of Sandwichgate

01:54.026 --> 01:56.464
and Black Ankle Sunday both
spreading like wildfire,

01:56.638 --> 01:58.944
Uncle Drew and his
childhood friends

01:59.119 --> 02:02.644
shot to the top of the first
Rucker Classic in '68.

02:02.818 --> 02:06.561
But it was not long before
it all came crashing down.

02:06.735 --> 02:08.127
It had to be something

02:08.301 --> 02:09.800
concerning him and a female.
We knew that.

02:09.824 --> 02:12.654
Uncle Drew and the ladies? Yeah.

02:12.828 --> 02:15.135
Man, the rumor was
Drew slept with

02:15.309 --> 02:18.616
one of his teammate's girl
the night before the finals.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.316
And when it came time
to play in the finals,

02:22.490 --> 02:26.058
they were all a complete
and total no-show.

02:26.233 --> 02:28.322
And after that he
just disappeared.

02:28.496 --> 02:30.498
Despite the mysterious
disappearance

02:30.672 --> 02:32.195
of its greatest player,

02:32.369 --> 02:34.632
the fabled park is
still the epicenter

02:34.806 --> 02:36.634
of the streetball universe.

02:36.808 --> 02:39.985
The question is, will this
year's Rucker Classic

02:40.160 --> 02:43.032
see the birth of a new
playground legend?

03:05.663 --> 03:07.012
Give me that.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.623
- Yo, what's up?
- What was that?

03:08.797 --> 03:09.624
Hey, what's the problem, man?
Mario was open.

03:09.798 --> 03:11.016
Maybe Mario was open,

03:11.191 --> 03:12.844
maybe he wasn't.
But you know what

03:13.018 --> 03:14.411
- the problem with that is?
- Huh?

03:14.585 --> 03:15.954
Mario. Hey, I don't
know what you doin'...

03:15.978 --> 03:17.414
- Close your ears!
- Mmm-hmm.

03:17.588 --> 03:19.851
Mario is terrible. Okay?
Look at him.

03:20.025 --> 03:21.766
I just told a grown man
to cover his ears,

03:21.940 --> 03:23.570
- and that's what he just did.
- Coach, what are you saying?

03:23.594 --> 03:24.943
Grab the ball, Casper.

03:26.249 --> 03:29.339
- You are my Beyonce. Okay?
- Beyonce?

03:29.513 --> 03:33.213
Not Dantay, not White
Dantay, not Regular Jeff,

03:33.387 --> 03:35.476
not Little Melvin, not Little
Melvin's stunt double.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.105
Okay, they're just
Destiny's Children.

03:37.129 --> 03:39.480
You are the star.
You are my Queen B.

03:39.654 --> 03:41.395
- All right.
- Let's make Lemonade, man.

03:41.569 --> 03:42.831
Score the rock.

03:43.005 --> 03:44.528
All right, now look
here, everybody.

03:44.702 --> 03:46.550
I'mma say this once. Nobody
else shoot the ball.

03:46.574 --> 03:49.011
Just Casper. Let's go.

03:50.882 --> 03:53.929
Dax Winslow. Sal
Masekela, SlamMagazine.

03:54.103 --> 03:55.887
- SlamMagazine, huh?
- Yes, sir.

03:56.061 --> 03:57.701
You mind if I get a
couple of sound bites?

03:57.759 --> 03:59.935
Do I mind? No, you shoulda
been talking to me.

04:00.109 --> 04:02.720
Um...

04:02.894 --> 04:06.071
How does a guy who
works at Foot Locker

04:06.246 --> 04:08.073
get a beast like Casper Jones

04:08.248 --> 04:09.814
to play for him in Rucker Park?

04:09.988 --> 04:13.905
Game recognize game.
He's the best player.

04:14.079 --> 04:15.079
I'm the best coach.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.603
We gonna take it all.

04:16.778 --> 04:18.146
I'm telling you, this
dude is amazing, man.

04:18.170 --> 04:19.519
Put me and Casper on the cover.

04:21.478 --> 04:22.934
- You know who that is, right?
- Know who who is?

04:22.958 --> 04:25.177
Who Mookie Bass is.

04:25.352 --> 04:27.397
A.k.a. that
Macklemore-lookin' dude

04:27.571 --> 04:29.834
that's makin' eyes at
your meal ticket, man.

04:32.315 --> 04:33.969
The hell is he doing here?

04:34.143 --> 04:36.145
Hey, what's up, Dix?

04:36.319 --> 04:38.103
First of all, you
know my name is Dax.

04:38.278 --> 04:39.888
A "bag of Dax" don't
make no sense.

04:40.062 --> 04:43.239
What is that? What's that smell?

04:43.413 --> 04:45.154
Is that a grudge?

04:45.328 --> 04:47.567
Are you still holdin' a grudge
'cause I blocked your shot?

04:47.591 --> 04:48.940
I have no recollection

04:49.114 --> 04:50.570
or even know what you
even talkin' about.

04:50.594 --> 04:52.117
Okay, let me refresh
your memory, then.

04:52.292 --> 04:53.692
You're about to hit
a three-pointer.

04:53.858 --> 04:55.618
Outta nowhere, a little
white boy comes up...

04:55.773 --> 04:58.254
Bam! Blocked that shot, I
think, with my armpit.

04:58.428 --> 05:00.909
Well, but I do remember,
there was that Spalding...

05:01.083 --> 05:02.626
You didn't even jump that high.
So like nipple...

05:02.650 --> 05:04.010
It was high enough
that I could see

05:04.042 --> 05:05.482
your face like this.
You were like...

05:05.653 --> 05:07.655
Okay, stop! That's not...
I didn't do that.

05:07.829 --> 05:09.221
What are you doin'? Stop.

05:11.963 --> 05:14.139
Casper, take it from the top.
Do something, y'all.

05:14.314 --> 05:16.316
Defense, Dantays, figure it out.

05:16.490 --> 05:17.839
Casper Jones, huh?

05:18.013 --> 05:20.015
Could you just literally
give me some space, man?

05:20.189 --> 05:21.930
Yo, you seen this tat
though, right here?

05:22.104 --> 05:23.821
That's the one where I blocked
your shot and won the game.

05:23.845 --> 05:25.518
And then these are the only
ones that really matter.

05:25.542 --> 05:29.285
Bam! Seven of nine
Rucker Championships.

05:29.459 --> 05:31.026
But don't you worry, Dix.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.134
I got plenty of length on
my Dax for the next one.

05:33.158 --> 05:35.378
I don't care. I don't wanna
hear about your man junk.

05:35.552 --> 05:36.901
Is there a point to all this?

05:37.075 --> 05:38.425
Yeah, I guess my point is,

05:38.599 --> 05:39.619
when you have a
history of winning

05:39.643 --> 05:40.949
as many titles as I do,

05:41.123 --> 05:42.559
cats like Casper Jones,

05:42.733 --> 05:44.779
they have a way of
gravitating towards you.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.349
So I'll see you when
I see you, Dix.

05:55.485 --> 05:57.202
Hey, Casper. Hey, man, let
me talk to you real quick.

05:57.226 --> 05:58.666
- What's up, coach?
- We good, right?

05:58.836 --> 06:00.229
You know what I mean?
Me and you.

06:00.403 --> 06:02.076
- Yeah, we all right.
- Do you need anything?

06:02.100 --> 06:03.928
You know what'd be dope?
The new Space Jams.

06:04.102 --> 06:06.583
They are amazing. They
pretty expensive, like $225.

06:06.757 --> 06:08.629
- Straight fire, though.
- They fire.

06:08.803 --> 06:10.239
But you know what?

06:10.413 --> 06:11.632
I just thought about it.

06:11.806 --> 06:13.126
I sold the last
pair this morning.

06:14.591 --> 06:16.351
The good news is, in
another week and a half,

06:16.419 --> 06:18.421
we get new stock, and I
got a pair just for you.

06:18.595 --> 06:20.275
- Okay. I like that.
- Yeah. You like that?

06:20.423 --> 06:21.946
Yeah, yeah, we all right.

06:22.120 --> 06:23.446
I got you, brother. So
it's me and you, we good?

06:23.470 --> 06:24.790
- Yeah, we rollin'.
- You with me.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.019
- I'm with you, dog.
- Forever.

06:26.168 --> 06:27.648
- Forever.
- Dax and Casper.

06:27.822 --> 06:29.190
- Yeah, you my bro.
- All right, man. I love you.

06:29.214 --> 06:30.738
- Love you, too, man.
- We good, right?

06:30.912 --> 06:32.130
Yeah, no doubt. All right.

06:32.304 --> 06:33.304
Cool.

06:40.356 --> 06:41.357
Don't worry, Dax.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.667
Don't worry, Dax. We'll
find you a family.

06:47.755 --> 06:50.497
- Yes.
- All right!

06:50.671 --> 06:52.281
We'll find you a family.

06:53.761 --> 06:55.153
Yes!

06:55.327 --> 06:57.068
Yes! Yes!

06:59.680 --> 07:01.421
Oh! What a move by Jordan!

07:06.338 --> 07:07.862
Jordan with the moves!

07:08.863 --> 07:11.039
Man, what an inspiration!

07:11.213 --> 07:14.042
Just listen to the crowd!
They love him!

07:14.216 --> 07:15.304
They love him!

07:18.829 --> 07:20.483
They love him! They love him!

07:26.881 --> 07:27.969
Yes!

07:33.322 --> 07:34.454
Yo, can we run with you?

07:34.628 --> 07:35.628
Yes, yes.

07:48.946 --> 07:51.035
No!

07:51.209 --> 07:52.646
You need to be on the bench!

07:52.820 --> 07:54.343
- He's worthless!
- You suck, Dax!

07:54.517 --> 07:55.755
- You need new glasses!
- He's the worst!

07:55.779 --> 07:57.477
You suck!

07:57.651 --> 08:01.437
Dax, that was unbearable!

08:01.611 --> 08:02.656
Dream sequence...

08:04.919 --> 08:07.225
Boy, you better than cable.

08:07.399 --> 08:08.899
Look, you wouldn't
even understand, okay?

08:08.923 --> 08:10.185
It's terrible.

08:10.359 --> 08:11.684
Dreamin' about that
little white boy

08:11.708 --> 08:13.014
slappin' that ball
out your hand?

08:13.188 --> 08:14.861
- Now, how do I look?
- You look expensive.

08:14.885 --> 08:16.765
Man, you know I can't
afford Gucci on my salary.

08:16.844 --> 08:19.934
Which is why when you and
Casper win the Rucker

08:20.108 --> 08:22.197
and the $100,000 check
that come with it,

08:22.371 --> 08:24.199
we'll be just fine.

08:24.373 --> 08:25.592
Baby, I thought that 100K,

08:25.766 --> 08:26.960
we was gonna use
to start a family.

08:26.984 --> 08:29.726
I want a Tesla.

08:29.900 --> 08:32.294
I would look so cute in a Tesla.

08:32.467 --> 08:34.514
And I'd have the little
screen on the side

08:34.688 --> 08:36.143
and then I could be like,
"Boop, boop, boop, boop!"

08:36.167 --> 08:38.039
And all my homegirls
gonna be like,

08:38.212 --> 08:41.259
"Look at Jess killin'
'em in a Tesla."

08:41.433 --> 08:43.479
Well, I mean, this sounds like

08:43.653 --> 08:46.177
a beautiful, beautiful
dream and everything,

08:46.351 --> 08:47.918
but I didn't hear
my name one time.

08:48.092 --> 08:49.548
You didn't say, "Oh, Dax
was in the Tesla with me."

08:49.572 --> 08:50.723
Baby, you gonna be there, too.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.749
It's gonna be me and you,

08:52.923 --> 08:54.664
and we just gonna be
one big happy family.

08:54.838 --> 08:56.274
I love that.

08:56.448 --> 08:58.233
Well, don't let the
ghost of white boy past

08:58.407 --> 08:59.843
scare you out of
gettin' this money.

09:00.017 --> 09:02.106
You win this game, and
you win this money,

09:02.280 --> 09:03.804
and bring it back home.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.588
- I'm motivated, baby!
- Whoo!

09:07.590 --> 09:10.724
Bam! That's right. These shoes
right here are classic.

09:10.898 --> 09:12.179
I wore these shoes last
night, little man,

09:12.203 --> 09:13.422
and I had a quadruple-double.

09:13.596 --> 09:15.250
- Look.
- That's right.

09:15.424 --> 09:18.514
I didn't want to say this,
but he isn't even that good.

09:18.688 --> 09:21.038
Why would you say
that about your baby?

09:21.212 --> 09:22.736
Are you a stepmother
or something?

09:22.910 --> 09:24.433
- You the real mother?
- Yeah.

09:24.607 --> 09:25.607
You shouldn't...

09:27.175 --> 09:28.437
Oh, you know something?

09:28.611 --> 09:30.178
Matter of fact,
Larry, help her out.

09:36.880 --> 09:38.447
- Hey, baby.
- Oh! Hey, girl!

09:38.621 --> 09:39.990
I thought we were
goin' to lunch today.

09:40.014 --> 09:41.252
You right. We supposed
to have lunch.

09:41.276 --> 09:42.494
Yeah, I'm very hungry.

09:42.669 --> 09:44.322
I been shoppin' all day.
Look it.

09:44.496 --> 09:46.387
I know. Look, do me a favor, babe.
Just give me a second.

09:46.411 --> 09:47.563
Just go look at some
shoes or something.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.110
Do they got them new RiRis?

09:49.284 --> 09:51.001
RiRis, BeeBees, whoever you
need, it's over there.

09:51.025 --> 09:52.959
Do they got 'em? Because,
you know, I do not wanna

09:52.983 --> 09:55.072
be shoppin' unless I can
get them new RiRis.

09:57.422 --> 09:58.422
'Cause she a savage, too.

09:58.467 --> 09:59.507
You a savage and you fine.

09:59.555 --> 10:00.556
- I'm fine?
- Yeah.

10:00.730 --> 10:01.949
Well, boy, you better shut up.

10:02.123 --> 10:03.559
Over there, look at those RiRis,

10:03.733 --> 10:05.387
you know what I mean?
I see you, boo.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.389
- She ready. Yeah!
- She ready.

10:09.957 --> 10:12.742
Oh. Do you see the
RiRis over here?

10:12.916 --> 10:14.788
Yo, my main man, Casper.
What up, brother?

10:14.962 --> 10:16.441
What up, Dax? How
you doin', man?

10:16.616 --> 10:18.443
The myth, the legend
in the makin'.

10:18.618 --> 10:20.228
Hold that thought.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.380
Man, I'm confused. I thought
these were out of stock.

10:22.404 --> 10:24.841
Bruh, the truck
came this morning

10:25.015 --> 10:26.495
and dropped off a
new stock of shoes.

10:26.669 --> 10:27.801
I was gonna call you.

10:27.975 --> 10:29.454
So you gonna hook us up, then?

10:29.629 --> 10:31.935
Oh, so you want me to get
shoes for everybody.

10:32.109 --> 10:33.110
Everybody.

10:33.284 --> 10:35.156
This dude, and this guy...

10:35.330 --> 10:36.829
If you can't do it, I got
plenty of people that...

10:36.853 --> 10:38.899
I got you. I'mma
take care of you,

10:39.073 --> 10:40.944
and your whole squad.

10:41.118 --> 10:43.033
Yeah, okay. Yeah,
that's a lot better.

10:43.207 --> 10:44.469
Taxes included.

10:44.644 --> 10:46.689
After I put in my
employee discount,

10:46.863 --> 10:50.040
which will probably
get me fired...

10:50.214 --> 10:52.216
The total is $833.50.

10:52.390 --> 10:53.870
Everybody, it's on Dax.

10:54.044 --> 10:56.743
It's on... It's on Dax.
Shoes for all y'all.

10:56.917 --> 10:58.135
Oh, hey, Casper.

10:58.309 --> 10:59.528
Oh, hey, baby, how you doin'?

10:59.702 --> 11:01.573
Good, how you doin'?

11:01.748 --> 11:03.334
Oh, baby, that's our
meal ticket right there.

11:03.358 --> 11:04.751
Oh, my goodness.

11:04.925 --> 11:07.144
Let me show you what
I found on Zillow.

11:07.318 --> 11:09.756
I found a really
cute brownstone.

11:09.930 --> 11:12.367
Two bedroom, hardwood floors...

11:12.541 --> 11:13.542
Transaction denied.

11:13.716 --> 11:15.065
Damn it!

11:15.239 --> 11:16.608
- Excuse me, what's goin' on?
- Damn what?

11:16.632 --> 11:17.938
Marty, don't worry about it.

11:18.112 --> 11:19.591
Aw, hell no.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.245
If the money for these shoes

11:21.419 --> 11:22.788
that just magically
flew out of here

11:22.812 --> 11:24.074
don't come up in 60 seconds,

11:24.248 --> 11:25.815
you and Miss Belly
Out goin' to jail.

11:25.989 --> 11:27.269
What the hell you talkin' about?

11:27.425 --> 11:29.253
First off, I didn't
do nothin' wrong,

11:29.427 --> 11:30.907
so I ain't goin' to jail.

11:31.081 --> 11:32.363
But thank you for noticin'
that my belly's out.

11:32.387 --> 11:32.822
Come here, come here, come here.

11:32.996 --> 11:33.996
What?

11:37.087 --> 11:38.238
That kid that just left here...

11:38.262 --> 11:39.568
Mmm-hmm?

11:39.742 --> 11:41.067
He's gonna change
our lives forever.

11:41.091 --> 11:42.223
50 percent.

11:43.920 --> 11:46.227
I mean, at the most, I
could do 49 percent.

11:46.401 --> 11:47.576
You got 30 seconds, brother!

11:47.750 --> 11:49.752
All right, 50 percent.

11:49.926 --> 11:51.711
Cool!

11:51.885 --> 11:54.104
It's nice doin'
business with you, boo.

11:54.278 --> 11:56.933
50 percent. I'm
gettin' 50 percent.

11:57.107 --> 11:58.979
Marty, did you hear that?
50 percent.

12:02.504 --> 12:03.723
Yo, yo, yo, yo!

12:05.986 --> 12:08.553
Look at this, man. Fresh
off the presses, y'all.

12:08.728 --> 12:09.990
Harlem Money, you see that?

12:10.164 --> 12:11.600
Come on, y'all, look!

12:11.774 --> 12:13.384
Go grab your jersey, come on.

12:13.558 --> 12:15.318
I didn't know you got
money for second place.

12:18.868 --> 12:20.696
Hey, man, what the
hell you doin' here?

12:20.870 --> 12:22.959
Why don't you enlighten
this fool, C-Dawg?

12:23.133 --> 12:24.744
- C-Dawg?
- I'm C-Dawg now.

12:24.918 --> 12:26.354
New team, new nickname.

12:26.528 --> 12:28.269
- Wait, what?
- Wait, what?

12:28.443 --> 12:29.923
That's what I said to him.
I was like,

12:29.966 --> 12:31.533
"C-Dawg, don't you
wanna be coached

12:31.707 --> 12:33.448
by a dude who looks like an M&M?

12:33.622 --> 12:35.818
What about a dude who looks
straight up like a basketball?

12:35.842 --> 12:38.192
Like a Syracuse Orange man."

12:49.246 --> 12:51.466
I've spent my life savings

12:51.640 --> 12:53.424
just to get in this tournament.

12:53.598 --> 12:55.862
I gotta give my girlfriend
half the winnings

12:56.036 --> 12:57.820
or she's gonna leave me.

12:57.994 --> 13:02.390
I took three buses and a train
just to pick up those jerseys.

13:02.564 --> 13:04.914
Those Jordans, man! You
know how much that cost me?

13:05.088 --> 13:07.177
Yo, by the way, thank
you for the kicks.

13:07.351 --> 13:08.613
They are mad expensive.

13:08.788 --> 13:10.228
There was no way I
was gonna buy 'em.

13:10.354 --> 13:11.616
All right, boys, let's roll.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.574
Come back here!

13:12.748 --> 13:14.489
Dantay! Other Dantay!

13:14.663 --> 13:16.663
- Casper, take off those shoes.
- I'mma hold these.

13:16.708 --> 13:17.927
You hear me, Casper?

13:18.101 --> 13:21.191
Take off those shoes!

13:22.236 --> 13:23.803
And comin' in at number one

13:23.977 --> 13:26.153
onSportsCenter's "Not
Top Ten" list...

13:26.327 --> 13:28.808
With the Rucker 50 right
around the corner,

13:28.982 --> 13:30.897
we have a meltdown
from New York City.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.943
I'm told the man you see here
is a coach named Dax Winslow.

13:34.117 --> 13:35.597
And, Dax, the good news is

13:35.771 --> 13:36.293
you're onSportsCenter.
The bad news is...

13:36.467 --> 13:37.817
Dax!

13:37.991 --> 13:39.511
What's up, girl?
What'd I do wrong now?

13:39.557 --> 13:40.994
I have so many questions.

13:41.168 --> 13:42.568
You're rolling around
on the ground,

13:42.691 --> 13:43.711
trying to take
somebody's sneakers

13:43.735 --> 13:45.389
off their sweaty feet?

13:45.563 --> 13:47.522
Is this your team? Are
these even your players?

13:47.696 --> 13:49.350
Come on, man!

13:49.524 --> 13:52.657
Dax, this is Rucker, man.
Have some respect.

13:52.832 --> 13:54.355
Damn you, Scott Van Pelt!

13:54.529 --> 13:56.139
Give me the shoe, Casper!
Right now!

13:56.313 --> 13:57.682
Flopping around on the
ground like fish.

13:57.706 --> 13:58.770
Everything gonna be
all right, okay?

13:58.794 --> 13:59.534
I'mma figure something out.

13:59.708 --> 14:00.970
I can't do this anymore.

14:02.102 --> 14:03.407
Excuse me?

14:03.581 --> 14:05.061
Do you think that I'm
countin' on you?

14:05.235 --> 14:08.717
'Cause I'm not. No, I
was counting on Casper.

14:08.891 --> 14:11.459
And you lost him. You
can't even do that right.

14:11.633 --> 14:14.592
Go in there, pack your
stuff up, and leave.

14:14.766 --> 14:16.206
You can't just kick
me out our house.

14:16.333 --> 14:17.857
This is my apartment.

14:18.031 --> 14:20.990
Do you even remember the
last time you paid rent?

14:21.164 --> 14:24.124
Okay, every Taco Tuesday,
who buy the $2 tacos?

14:24.298 --> 14:26.822
Don't nobody care
about no damn tacos!

14:26.996 --> 14:28.215
Okay, I paid the water bill

14:28.389 --> 14:29.825
- that one time.
- Get out my house!

14:31.392 --> 14:33.873
Jess, I ain't got nowhere to go.
You know?

14:34.047 --> 14:37.006
I didn't have no family.
And then I met you.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.792
And you took me in. And
you changed my life.

14:40.967 --> 14:45.885
Baby, we in this together.
You're my everything.

14:46.059 --> 14:50.585
Please, just let me stay
here and figure things out.

14:59.681 --> 15:02.162
Hey! Don't leave
with my bag, fool.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.661
Where I'm supposed
to put my stuff?

15:03.685 --> 15:05.034
Leave with what you came with!

15:05.208 --> 15:07.341
Fine, I'll give you back
your stupid, fake bag.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.909
It's not stupid, you stupid.

15:10.083 --> 15:12.085
My bag is smarter than you!

15:22.486 --> 15:24.010
Give my shoes back!

15:25.750 --> 15:27.187
This is Rucker, man.

15:27.361 --> 15:28.801
You're supposed to
have some respect.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.451
You're rolling around
on the ground...

15:30.494 --> 15:31.278
trying to take
somebody's sneakers

15:31.452 --> 15:33.106
off their sweaty feet?

15:33.280 --> 15:34.910
I know y'all think this is
all fun and games and stuff.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.774
But I used everything I
got on this tournament.

15:36.805 --> 15:38.415
Did you get a receipt? Huh?

15:38.589 --> 15:40.374
No, man, the money's
non-refundable.

15:40.548 --> 15:42.202
That's cold.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.944
This a perfect opportunity
for Dax to meet Uncle Drew!

15:47.033 --> 15:50.688
Don't start that in here with
the old and the Uncle Drews.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.710
You're trying to throw a
toothpick in a lumberyard.

15:52.734 --> 15:55.215
The man is the greatest
blacktop player

15:55.389 --> 15:56.999
I ever seen in my life.

15:57.173 --> 15:58.542
He's real. I've seen
that boy put up

15:58.566 --> 16:00.002
40 points against
The Destroyers.

16:00.176 --> 16:01.961
Using just his left
hand and his chin.

16:02.135 --> 16:03.745
His other hand, he
had a ham sandwich

16:03.919 --> 16:04.920
with extra cheese on it.

16:05.094 --> 16:06.791
And mayo. He likes mayonnaise.

16:06.966 --> 16:08.271
Okay, come on, man,

16:08.445 --> 16:09.969
that's just like
talking about Bigfoot.

16:10.143 --> 16:11.990
Bigfoot. You can't compare
Bigfoot to Uncle Drew.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.537
Son of a bitch used
to date my sister.

16:13.711 --> 16:15.278
He used to date my
sister and my mother.

16:15.452 --> 16:16.627
He actually hit

16:16.801 --> 16:18.586
- my eighth grade teacher.
- Ooh!

16:18.760 --> 16:20.912
Ain't none of my business what
that man does in his bedtime.

16:20.936 --> 16:22.546
I know he had a foot fetish.

16:22.720 --> 16:24.722
All right. The '60s was a wild time.
Okay? So what?

16:25.941 --> 16:27.073
Remember them Buicks?

16:27.247 --> 16:28.726
Everybody had them damn Buicks.

16:28.900 --> 16:29.921
You'd ride around, had
them big old back seat.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.164
You can't move your hips.

16:31.338 --> 16:32.618
But you can still
move your lips.

16:32.730 --> 16:34.297
Hey, I ain't gonna
go no further.

16:34.471 --> 16:38.171
All you need is some Viagra,
and some dress socks.

16:38.345 --> 16:39.911
Ain't have no damn
Viagra back then!

16:40.086 --> 16:42.436
You had to get two ice-cream
sticks and a rubber band

16:42.610 --> 16:44.916
to make the stuff
stand up like that.

16:45.091 --> 16:46.633
I don't have time for this, man.
I gotta go.

16:46.657 --> 16:47.857
Hey, whoa, whoa. Hold on, Dax,

16:47.963 --> 16:49.660
hold on. Now, look.

16:49.834 --> 16:52.533
You need to go holler at Uncle Drew.
Okay?

16:52.707 --> 16:54.578
He's a Zen master of basketball.

16:54.752 --> 16:56.189
But you gotta believe.

16:56.363 --> 16:58.147
Hey, look. Maybe he was good.

16:58.321 --> 17:01.020
But you think this old man can still ball?
Come on, bruh.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.631
I'm good, man. I gotta
find some players, man.

17:03.805 --> 17:06.460
You'll be sorry, Dax. Don't
do that to yourself.

17:06.634 --> 17:08.940
Get with Drew! Get with Drew!

17:44.759 --> 17:46.674
Welcome to the jungle, baby.

17:46.848 --> 17:48.848
Get out of here. Go corner,
corner, corner! Corner!

17:50.852 --> 17:52.212
Over here, over
here, hold on, son!

17:52.245 --> 17:53.550
See, that right there,

17:53.724 --> 17:55.422
that's the problem
with your generation.

17:55.596 --> 17:58.207
Million dollar move and
a five cent finish.

17:58.381 --> 17:59.556
You haven't made a shot yet.

17:59.861 --> 18:00.861
- Come back!
- Come on!

18:02.516 --> 18:04.344
- I was open.
- I had to shoot it, man,

18:04.518 --> 18:06.694
I've taken out trash that
don't stink as bad as that.

18:08.609 --> 18:10.654
Dr. Naismith would be
rolling in his grave

18:10.828 --> 18:12.371
if he knew what these
bums is up to out here.

18:12.395 --> 18:15.006
You talk a lot of smack
for a geriatric.

18:15.181 --> 18:16.680
It's a shame you can't
back any of it up.

18:16.704 --> 18:19.185
And who's to say I can't?

18:21.100 --> 18:22.797
All right, then, what's the bet?

18:24.233 --> 18:26.061
If you win...

18:26.235 --> 18:27.995
I'll leave the park and
I'll never come back.

18:28.150 --> 18:29.630
- Good.
- Real good.

18:29.804 --> 18:31.458
But if I win, you and your crew

18:31.632 --> 18:33.653
start playing the game the
way it's meant to be played.

18:33.677 --> 18:35.375
Oh, how's that? On
a peach basket?

18:37.377 --> 18:40.815
It's like a perfectly
orchestrated symphony.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.338
What?

18:43.948 --> 18:46.516
Not any instrument is more
important than another.

18:46.690 --> 18:47.822
And what's in it for you?

18:47.996 --> 18:50.259
Love, youngblood. Only love.

18:50.433 --> 18:51.713
What is this dude talking about?

18:51.782 --> 18:53.306
What the hell does
that even mean?

18:53.480 --> 18:54.611
What are you talking about?

18:54.785 --> 18:56.091
Hold my nuts.

18:56.265 --> 18:58.267
Hold your nuts?

18:58.441 --> 18:59.766
Hey, J! Look at
this dude out here.

18:59.790 --> 19:01.531
Everybody off the court.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.986
Get off the court, man. Get
your big behind off the court.

19:04.708 --> 19:06.493
Hey, man. Give him the business.

19:08.016 --> 19:09.409
Ball up.

19:09.583 --> 19:12.063
Hey, young fella, you
better watch that.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.174
Aren't you gonna get
in your stance?

19:16.198 --> 19:17.721
I am in my stance.

19:21.856 --> 19:23.379
Don't worry, grandpa.

19:23.553 --> 19:25.512
Gonna have you home in
plenty of time for NCIS.

19:25.686 --> 19:27.253
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

19:27.427 --> 19:30.473
Hey. For the show I know though,

19:30.647 --> 19:33.259
even a bum ain't as broke
as your jump shot.

19:33.433 --> 19:34.673
- Give it to him, J.
- Prove it.

19:34.782 --> 19:36.131
You wanna see it rain?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.176
Let it rain.

19:38.220 --> 19:39.352
Raindrops. 2-0.

19:41.267 --> 19:42.529
Next basket wins it.

19:42.703 --> 19:44.463
It's getting to be about
that time, ain't it?

19:50.232 --> 19:51.320
Yeah, give it to him.

19:51.494 --> 19:52.930
This game is over.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.183
It's time for you to
change your PIN number.

20:05.247 --> 20:06.422
'Cause you just got robbed.

20:12.646 --> 20:14.474
- Come on back.
- J, come on, son!

20:14.648 --> 20:16.103
You want me to tell you
your first mistake

20:16.127 --> 20:17.520
or your second?

20:17.694 --> 20:18.478
What's the matter, you
forgot the score?

20:18.652 --> 20:21.089
One. You got too cocky.

20:21.263 --> 20:22.612
There's a fine line between

20:22.786 --> 20:24.614
confidence and
arrogance, youngblood.

20:27.791 --> 20:29.532
Come on back. Come on back.

20:29.706 --> 20:32.100
And then, two, you're
giving up your lead hip.

20:32.274 --> 20:33.710
You might as well
unlock the door

20:33.884 --> 20:37.018
and have your wife show
me where the china is.

20:37.192 --> 20:38.846
I wouldn't do that
either if I was you.

20:40.369 --> 20:42.502
Come on, J! No, no!

20:45.113 --> 20:46.897
He cookin' your boy.

20:47.071 --> 20:47.855
Man, you need to go back there
and play with them kids, man.

20:48.029 --> 20:49.509
I get buckets.

20:49.683 --> 20:51.032
Shut up, old man.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.468
Go on, youngblood.

20:53.382 --> 20:54.470
Check ball.

20:54.644 --> 20:57.343
This game is all mental.
All mental.

21:02.304 --> 21:04.654
Hand down, man down.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.482
- Anybody got a GPS?
- Come on, J!

21:06.656 --> 21:08.776
You know, gonna need a whole
new zip code on that one.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.053
Game point, youngblood.

21:12.227 --> 21:13.228
Whatever.

21:13.794 --> 21:14.794
You ready?

21:15.926 --> 21:17.232
Yo, I'll give you that.

21:17.406 --> 21:19.060
Nah. Nah, don't give him that.

21:19.234 --> 21:20.670
You still don't believe, do you?

21:20.844 --> 21:22.063
Get your hand up!

21:22.237 --> 21:23.557
No, don't give it to him.
Don't...

21:25.240 --> 21:26.633
Don't do him like
that, Uncle Drew!

21:27.895 --> 21:28.939
Youngblood.

21:30.158 --> 21:31.159
Good game.

21:33.509 --> 21:34.771
Who is that dude?

21:35.990 --> 21:37.339
Hey! Hey! Hey!

21:37.513 --> 21:38.688
Oh...

21:38.862 --> 21:40.516
Oh, my God, man.

21:40.690 --> 21:42.015
That was a pretty amazing
show you put on back there.

21:42.039 --> 21:43.319
It was one of the
greatest things

21:43.432 --> 21:44.955
I've ever seen, honestly.

21:45.129 --> 21:46.411
How're you doing?
M-my name is Dax.

21:46.435 --> 21:47.915
I'm not interested.

21:48.089 --> 21:49.109
I haven't even told you
what I'm trying to do.

21:49.133 --> 21:50.613
Okay, okay.

21:50.787 --> 21:52.199
You can't believe someone
that looks like me

21:52.223 --> 21:53.592
can play like Jordan,
Magic, or Bird.

21:53.616 --> 21:54.976
You want to take
advantage of that.

21:55.052 --> 21:56.682
See if you can cash in somehow.
I know your MO.

21:56.706 --> 21:58.273
What? No, no. You got
me all wrong, man.

21:58.447 --> 21:59.468
Look, I just want to talk to you

21:59.492 --> 22:00.057
about the Rucker, you know?

22:00.231 --> 22:02.495
The Rucker?

22:02.669 --> 22:04.869
You don't know nothing about
no real Rucker, youngblood.

22:07.587 --> 22:09.589
Exactly. You right. I
don't know anything

22:09.763 --> 22:11.634
about the Rucker. A
lot of us don't.

22:11.808 --> 22:14.115
But someone like you
could help us, man.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.527
We could combine the old school

22:15.551 --> 22:16.813
with the new school, right?

22:16.987 --> 22:18.511
Like a old school,
new school remix.

22:18.685 --> 22:20.382
Where you can educate
all the youngbloods

22:20.556 --> 22:22.036
who are lost in
their way, right?

22:22.210 --> 22:23.666
And show 'em what they're
really doing wrong.

22:23.690 --> 22:25.126
You can do that.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.041
Is a lot of lost youngbloods
out there, huh?

22:27.215 --> 22:30.044
It is so many lost youngbloods
out here, it is ridiculous.

22:30.218 --> 22:31.567
If I could help them, I would,

22:31.741 --> 22:33.153
but I don't know,
because I'm lost, too.

22:33.177 --> 22:35.223
Okay? And that's
why we need you.

22:35.397 --> 22:36.548
Look, look, look.
Perfect example.

22:36.572 --> 22:37.921
This is, this is who you are.

22:38.095 --> 22:41.882
You a lonely lighthouse
in a sea of fog.

22:43.623 --> 22:44.928
I actually kind of like that.

22:45.102 --> 22:46.471
- I like that.
- That's good, ain't it?

22:46.495 --> 22:47.516
Yeah, yeah, that's
good, that's good.

22:47.540 --> 22:48.758
That's what I'm telling you.

22:48.932 --> 22:50.717
You are coming to
the rescue, man.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.999
You get a chance to teach this
in front of a bigger audience.

22:53.023 --> 22:55.896
At the Rucker. The Rucker.

22:57.245 --> 22:58.246
Rucker.

23:00.030 --> 23:02.468
The Rucker would be nice.

23:02.642 --> 23:05.732
I'll tell you what. I'll
do it on one condition.

23:05.906 --> 23:07.255
Yes!

23:09.475 --> 23:11.999
Anything you want. I don't
care what it is. I got you.

23:12.173 --> 23:13.522
It's gotta be my team.

23:14.131 --> 23:15.219
My boys.

23:16.003 --> 23:17.396
Okay. Anything but that.

23:17.570 --> 23:19.136
No. Because it's my team.

23:19.310 --> 23:20.660
Yeah, I guess we done here.

23:20.834 --> 23:22.488
Dax whatever...

23:22.662 --> 23:24.490
Okay, okay, okay.

23:24.664 --> 23:28.537
I'm in, okay? My team.
Your roster.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.235
It's my team, my roster.

23:31.975 --> 23:34.108
Look, where you goin'?

23:34.282 --> 23:36.240
It's a long drive
to Chocolate City.

23:36.415 --> 23:38.721
Wait, Chocolate City?
What's in D.C.?

23:38.895 --> 23:42.769
Preacher. He's the best power
forward I ever played with.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.743
I mean, you don't know
no local power forward?

23:44.858 --> 23:46.425
Somebody that stay
in the neighborhood?

23:48.078 --> 23:50.690
Here she is. Yeah.

23:51.473 --> 23:52.753
You know, so if
Billy Dee Willams

23:52.909 --> 23:54.345
and Diana Ross had a love child,

23:54.520 --> 23:56.240
it would've definitely
been inside this van.

23:56.391 --> 23:57.958
Go on and look way back there.

23:58.132 --> 23:59.849
Go ahead. Take a look. Take
a look way back there.

23:59.873 --> 24:02.179
That right there is
the boom boom room.

24:02.353 --> 24:05.356
Boom boom room come
with one rule.

24:05.531 --> 24:07.228
No shoes in the boom boom room.

24:07.968 --> 24:09.230
So, I could wear shoes

24:09.404 --> 24:11.450
throughout the rest of
the part of this van,

24:11.624 --> 24:13.930
but if I go a couple feet back,

24:14.104 --> 24:15.628
I gotta take my shoes off?

24:15.802 --> 24:17.543
Why do I gotta take my
shoes off back there?

24:17.717 --> 24:19.893
And I can leave my shoes
on, like right here?

24:20.067 --> 24:21.329
It's the same space.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.809
Well, it's the living room,

24:22.983 --> 24:24.680
and then it goes to
the boom boom room.

24:24.854 --> 24:26.854
See, that don't even make
sense because it's a van.

24:26.943 --> 24:28.312
Everything is right
next to each other.

24:28.336 --> 24:29.661
Let's go over the
rest of the rules.

24:29.685 --> 24:30.965
No, but I'm saying that don't...

24:32.471 --> 24:34.690
Hey, don't be slamming my door.

24:34.864 --> 24:36.910
Oh, I'm sorry about that.

24:37.084 --> 24:38.191
Hey, man, you just
did the same...

24:38.215 --> 24:39.652
Now, let's go over the rules.

24:39.826 --> 24:42.872
One. I'm the pilot.
Means I steer the ship.

24:43.046 --> 24:46.441
Two. I'm the weatherman.
I control the heat.

24:46.615 --> 24:47.615
Did you just say heat?

24:47.660 --> 24:49.183
I don't know if you know.

24:49.357 --> 24:50.856
It's the middle of summer,
so maybe you should...

24:50.880 --> 24:52.534
Three. Don't be
questioning one and two.

24:52.708 --> 24:54.643
Can't help it if I'm running
a little cold these days.

24:54.667 --> 24:57.583
Four, I'm the DJ, which
means I control the music.

24:57.757 --> 25:00.542
Whoo!

25:00.716 --> 25:02.805
What's that? Is that a Game Boy?

25:02.979 --> 25:05.678
- Electronic book?
- Mmm-hmm.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.680
You gonna see.

25:07.854 --> 25:11.466
Oh, yeah! You hear that?
You hear that?

25:11.640 --> 25:13.903
- That's a eight track?
- You hear that?

25:15.644 --> 25:16.993
Come on, come on take a ride

25:17.167 --> 25:18.386
That ain't no jive

25:18.560 --> 25:20.083
Can't we just go
to Chocolate City?

25:21.563 --> 25:22.782
Don't even have to drive

25:22.956 --> 25:23.696
Can you at least
turn down the heat?

25:23.870 --> 25:25.045
Slippity-slide

25:26.046 --> 25:27.047
My glasses are sweating.

25:27.221 --> 25:28.527
Just sail on

25:28.701 --> 25:30.243
That's what I do Just
sail on, that's what I do

25:30.267 --> 25:31.897
How you dancing like
that in a jogging suit?

25:31.921 --> 25:32.921
Are you not hot?

25:34.924 --> 25:36.230
I'm really creeped out.

25:36.404 --> 25:38.014
Gotta get the boys.

25:38.188 --> 25:39.862
I gotta turn up the heat a
little bit though. Yeah.

25:39.886 --> 25:41.540
Please don't turn the heat up!

25:54.248 --> 25:55.528
We've been listening
to this song

25:55.684 --> 25:57.425
since this morning.
It is nighttime!

25:58.948 --> 26:00.689
Oh, yeah.

26:00.863 --> 26:03.692
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

26:03.866 --> 26:05.389
What you know about this, Drew?

26:05.564 --> 26:06.889
I thought this was gonna
be a boring road trip.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.392
You got the classics
playing, man!

26:08.567 --> 26:09.848
What you know about the
classics, youngblood?

26:09.872 --> 26:11.395
I know a lot, man.

26:11.570 --> 26:12.938
How did you get Biggie
Smalls on a eight track?

26:12.962 --> 26:15.835
That's crazy, man!
Junior M.A.F.I.A.!

26:16.009 --> 26:17.445
Junior what?

26:17.619 --> 26:21.057
You know what I said.
You know who they are.

26:21.231 --> 26:22.798
To all my ladies in the place

26:22.972 --> 26:24.844
With style and grace,
allow me to...

26:25.018 --> 26:26.672
Okay. Okay.

26:26.846 --> 26:28.282
New rule, youngblood.

26:28.456 --> 26:30.284
None of this
rappity-hippity-hop nonsense.

26:30.458 --> 26:31.720
You understand?

26:31.894 --> 26:33.374
What you mean
rappity-hippity-hop?

26:33.548 --> 26:34.288
That's not what it's called.
It's called hip-hop.

26:34.462 --> 26:35.985
My car, my version.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.292
Talking about styling.
What is that?

26:38.466 --> 26:39.965
First of all, I can tell
you don't have style.

26:39.989 --> 26:41.401
'Cause you always got
on jogging suits.

26:41.425 --> 26:43.471
Talkin' from the hustler
with the fake chains.

26:43.645 --> 26:45.365
These are real. I got
these for my birthday,

26:45.473 --> 26:46.668
- so go about your business.
- Yeah, right. Those cost...

26:46.692 --> 26:47.867
- Three checks!
- Those cost

26:48.041 --> 26:49.409
- fifty cent a piece.
- Three checks!

26:49.433 --> 26:50.957
My teeth cost more than that.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.524
This is real music. Now
listen to the words.

26:53.699 --> 26:55.309
At least as far as I can see

26:55.483 --> 26:57.006
Oh, yeah.

26:57.180 --> 27:01.489
Can see, I want to keep you here

27:01.663 --> 27:03.230
Laying next to me

27:03.404 --> 27:05.338
That's what I tell my girls
in the boom boom room.

27:05.362 --> 27:09.062
Love between the sheets

27:09.236 --> 27:10.890
Ooh, this is my favorite part.
Go ahead.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.980
- My baby, ooh - Okay.
I'm sorry.

27:14.154 --> 27:16.722
- Baby, baby, my love
- I'm sorry.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.506
Stop sing... You're ruining it!

27:18.680 --> 27:20.290
First off. Watch your tone.

27:20.464 --> 27:22.464
Look, here we go. Just listen to it.
Give it a try.

27:23.990 --> 27:25.556
Come on.

27:25.731 --> 27:27.056
You see how quick I did that?
I just pushed play.

27:27.080 --> 27:29.430
I ain't have to take
out an Atari cartridge

27:29.604 --> 27:31.998
- and stuff it in the radio.
- Okay, okay. Pause, pause.

27:32.172 --> 27:33.564
How do you pause it?

27:34.478 --> 27:35.958
Okay, youngblood.

27:36.132 --> 27:38.439
There ain't gonna be
none of that nonsense

27:38.613 --> 27:40.093
here in my car right now.

27:40.267 --> 27:41.703
You gonna call this nonsense.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.246
This is one of the
greatest MCs of all time.

27:43.270 --> 27:44.670
Yeah, what about the
Isley Brothers?

27:44.793 --> 27:46.292
I don't know too much
of their history,

27:46.316 --> 27:48.076
- but I'll Google it later.
- What is Google?

28:01.070 --> 28:02.419
Hey, man, is this a church?

28:02.593 --> 28:04.247
Heck else it's gonna be?

28:04.421 --> 28:06.119
Did we road trip all
the way out here

28:06.293 --> 28:07.816
to pick up an actual preacher?

28:07.990 --> 28:09.339
You got a problem with that?

28:09.513 --> 28:11.013
No, I don't have a
problem with it, man.

28:11.037 --> 28:12.557
But I thought it was,
like, a nickname,

28:12.691 --> 28:14.571
like "Hot Sauce" or "Crazy
Legs" or "The Glove."

28:18.044 --> 28:20.350
Amen. Amen, Amen.

28:20.524 --> 28:24.180
We're gathered here
today to bear witness

28:24.354 --> 28:26.182
to the anointing... Ha!

28:27.009 --> 28:29.272
The christening... Ha!

28:29.446 --> 28:31.622
The blessing... Ha!

28:31.797 --> 28:34.147
Of this young rookie soul.

28:35.844 --> 28:39.718
And it is with the
purity of heart we pray

28:39.892 --> 28:42.111
that he will one day grow

28:42.851 --> 28:44.026
to drive the paint...

28:44.200 --> 28:45.636
Why is he holding him like that?

28:45.811 --> 28:48.030
Crash the boards of
moral righteousness.

28:49.684 --> 28:50.990
No, no, please, no.

28:51.164 --> 28:52.426
My man Kevin Durant started

28:52.600 --> 28:54.080
a new beginning in Golden State.

28:54.254 --> 28:55.472
You preach, Preacher.

28:55.646 --> 28:56.865
He's gonna dunk a baby.

28:57.039 --> 28:59.085
One for the money

29:00.042 --> 29:01.783
Two for the show

29:02.610 --> 29:04.394
Three to get ready

29:06.135 --> 29:07.658
Whoa, whoa, wait, wait!

29:07.833 --> 29:09.419
Hey! Man! What are you
doing with that baby, man?

29:09.443 --> 29:11.203
You can't baptize a baby.
You cannot do that.

29:11.358 --> 29:12.838
- You cannot...
- Hey, Dax.

29:13.012 --> 29:13.795
- Dax, sit down.
- Drew, let me go. I got this!

29:13.969 --> 29:15.623
That is a baby, okay?

29:15.797 --> 29:17.930
You christen a baby, right?
You hold the baby, right?

29:18.104 --> 29:19.603
Maybe splash a little
water on his face.

29:19.627 --> 29:21.170
He gonna cry a little
bit but no big deal.

29:21.194 --> 29:24.023
You don't dunk a baby
in a baptismal pool.

29:24.197 --> 29:26.112
What type of parents
are y'all to let this

29:26.286 --> 29:28.462
really large man
pick your baby up?

29:28.636 --> 29:29.724
He did it like this.

29:29.898 --> 29:31.595
He put your baby
behind his back.

29:31.770 --> 29:34.076
You gonna let this man
Steph Curry your baby?

29:34.250 --> 29:35.250
That's insane!

29:35.382 --> 29:36.557
Uh, maybe the midget's right.

29:36.731 --> 29:38.167
Yeah. Can we have our baby back?

29:38.341 --> 29:40.561
Is there something I can
help you with, son?

29:40.735 --> 29:42.650
Dax. Give it a break.

29:42.824 --> 29:44.347
- No!
- Sit down!

29:44.521 --> 29:46.108
I'm not sitting down, Drew!
I'm taking a stand.

29:46.132 --> 29:47.176
- All right.
- Thank you.

29:47.350 --> 29:48.395
All right, I warned you.

29:48.569 --> 29:50.353
Where you from, son?

29:50.527 --> 29:51.722
I'll tell you where I'm from.
I'm from New York City, okay?

29:51.746 --> 29:53.313
Look here, Tiny Tim.

29:53.487 --> 29:55.924
Took me almost an hour
to fill up that pool.

29:56.098 --> 29:58.231
Somebody's getting
baptized, you understand?

29:58.405 --> 30:00.886
Dunk this potbelly Teletubby!

30:01.060 --> 30:02.713
You can't talk to me like that.

30:02.888 --> 30:04.019
Y'all wanna baptize him?

30:04.193 --> 30:05.412
- Yeah!
- What?

30:05.586 --> 30:07.109
Bring him on up.

30:07.283 --> 30:09.111
Dunk him like a fat donut.

30:09.285 --> 30:10.828
- Dunk him, Preacher.
- What are you doing, man?

30:10.852 --> 30:13.028
- That my boy, Drew.
- Mmm-hmm.

30:13.202 --> 30:15.378
Drew, you gotta make him
take one for the team.

30:15.552 --> 30:16.553
For the team!

30:16.727 --> 30:18.207
No, no, no.

30:18.381 --> 30:20.181
Gonna have to take one for the team.
Oh, yeah.

30:20.209 --> 30:21.732
What you mean, "Take
one for the team"?

30:24.692 --> 30:26.259
Drew,

30:26.433 --> 30:29.697
just like back in the day
when we used to hoop,

30:29.871 --> 30:32.047
you could still throw
the alley-oop.

30:32.221 --> 30:35.007
Thank you for throwing
me this lost soul.

31:01.947 --> 31:03.905
One last run at the Rucker?

31:04.775 --> 31:05.994
Hmm.

31:06.168 --> 31:07.648
50th anniversary.

31:07.822 --> 31:11.130
You know this is more
than a 50th anniversary.

31:11.304 --> 31:14.916
This here, divine intervention.

31:15.090 --> 31:16.352
I wouldn't call it all that.

31:16.526 --> 31:17.852
I'm gonna have to run
it by Betty Lou though.

31:17.876 --> 31:19.268
Run what by Betty Lou?

31:19.442 --> 31:20.487
Drew's putting the squad

31:20.661 --> 31:22.228
- back together.
- Yep.

31:22.402 --> 31:24.042
You forget what happened
to you, Preacher,

31:24.186 --> 31:25.884
when you get between them lines?

31:26.058 --> 31:28.408
No, no, no. I just
ain't laced 'em up

31:28.582 --> 31:29.844
in a while, that's all.

31:30.018 --> 31:31.585
And there is a reason for that.

31:31.759 --> 31:32.759
Quick question.

31:32.847 --> 31:34.631
What exactly is "a while"?

31:34.805 --> 31:36.285
I mean, is that like
a few weeks or...

31:36.416 --> 31:37.808
30.

31:37.983 --> 31:40.376
- 35 years. Still nice, though.
- 35 years.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.858
Wait, 35 years? Come on,
man, that's ridiculous.

31:44.032 --> 31:46.556
Our little hobbit is right.
It's ridiculous.

31:46.730 --> 31:49.298
It's God's work that matters now.
Not basketball.

31:49.472 --> 31:51.170
Just because it's God's work,

31:51.344 --> 31:52.823
don't mean it's not still work.

31:52.998 --> 31:54.695
His work is never done.

31:54.869 --> 31:56.229
Now, I've had about
enough of this.

31:58.133 --> 32:01.658
Book of Psalms, chapter
62, verse one and two.

32:01.832 --> 32:06.098
Fool, please. Book of Psalms,
chapter 23, verse four.

32:06.272 --> 32:10.537
Ephesians five,
chapter 22, boom!

32:10.711 --> 32:14.541
Book of Betty Lou, chapter
one, verse "I said so."

32:16.804 --> 32:19.328
You heard the woman. I can't go.

32:19.502 --> 32:21.417
One, it wasn't no
black hobbits, right?

32:21.591 --> 32:23.593
And, two, that is one
mean churchwoman.

32:23.767 --> 32:25.310
She ain't supposed to be
calling me ugly like that.

32:25.334 --> 32:26.596
Okay, and I'm handsome.

32:26.770 --> 32:28.170
I'm the short version
of Idris Elba.

32:28.207 --> 32:29.607
The ladies say it
all the time, man.

32:29.773 --> 32:30.949
And is he even coming?

32:31.123 --> 32:32.733
- He's coming.
- How do you know?

32:32.907 --> 32:35.431
Basketball is in his blood.
Same as it is in mine.

32:35.605 --> 32:37.085
Both of y'all old as hell, okay?

32:37.259 --> 32:38.579
And I at least saw
you play first.

32:38.608 --> 32:39.958
I need to see him
shoot at least.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.742
Youngblood, you can't
teach seven feet.

32:41.916 --> 32:43.415
What you mean you can't
teach seven feet?

32:43.439 --> 32:44.959
- What are you talking...
- Hallelujah!

32:45.093 --> 32:47.400
Man can only take
so much nagging

32:47.574 --> 32:48.792
before he done had enough.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.359
I told ya.

32:50.533 --> 32:51.641
He could have got in
here without yelling

32:51.665 --> 32:53.362
"Hallelujah" in my ear, right?

32:53.536 --> 32:55.340
Preacher, you're supposed
to take your shoes off

32:55.364 --> 32:56.975
in the boom boom room.

32:57.149 --> 32:58.865
You're gonna tell me the
rules of the boom boom room?

32:58.889 --> 33:00.969
I'm just trying to make sure
we're clear, that's all.

33:01.022 --> 33:02.415
Oh, Lord.

33:03.416 --> 33:04.417
Spoke too soon.

33:08.116 --> 33:09.161
Why are we slowing down?

33:09.335 --> 33:10.945
Light just turned red.

33:11.119 --> 33:13.382
So? Run it, fool! You know
how worked up she can get.

33:13.556 --> 33:15.341
Oh, no, I ain't trying
to get no ticket now.

33:20.650 --> 33:21.651
Preacher!

33:22.522 --> 33:23.871
I know you in that van!

33:24.045 --> 33:25.645
She got a baseball bat
in a church dress?

33:31.487 --> 33:32.880
I am Betty to the Lou.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.230
They don't even know
who they messing with.

33:35.404 --> 33:36.536
Don't you know any players

33:36.710 --> 33:38.103
that don't require a road trip?

33:38.277 --> 33:39.017
And what's the deal
with Betty Lou anyway?

33:39.191 --> 33:40.409
It's just one weekend.

33:40.583 --> 33:42.281
Is it me? Or is
it nippy in here?

33:42.455 --> 33:44.065
It ain't just you.

33:44.239 --> 33:46.043
What is wrong with you two?
I am melting over here.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.765
Good. Looks like you could
stand to lose a few.

33:48.939 --> 33:50.506
Is it just me, or is
little man's head

33:50.680 --> 33:52.726
abnormally large for his body?

33:52.900 --> 33:55.337
Hey, youngblood, how much does
your neck hate your head?

33:55.511 --> 33:57.339
- Big head, little neck.
- Funny jokes.

33:57.513 --> 33:58.862
He was a baby bobblehead doll.

33:59.037 --> 34:00.473
Wobble, wobble, wobble.

34:00.647 --> 34:02.953
Actually, my head is the
most normalest size

34:03.128 --> 34:04.670
you could think of.
I've measured my head.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.914
Well, you sure got some
little ass ears then.

34:07.088 --> 34:10.264
Mama deserve a purple heart,
passin' a melon that big.

34:12.005 --> 34:13.790
Anybody else use a disco nap?

34:13.964 --> 34:16.402
See, now that is a
good idea, Preacher.

34:16.576 --> 34:18.491
My eyelids been heavy all day.

34:26.716 --> 34:27.761
Seriously?

34:29.632 --> 34:31.547
These two are unbelievable.

34:32.112 --> 34:33.112
You good?

34:33.158 --> 34:34.768
All set.

34:34.942 --> 34:36.639
Still a little nippy
in here though.

34:36.813 --> 34:38.380
That's strike two, youngblood.

34:38.554 --> 34:40.426
The next one, you gonna
be riding on the roof.

34:40.600 --> 34:42.254
Not with that big
ass head, he can't.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.299
Too much wind resistance.

35:09.281 --> 35:10.847
Hey, Preacher, can I
ask you a question?

35:11.500 --> 35:12.980
Can I say no?

35:13.154 --> 35:14.392
What happened to y'all
back in the day, man?

35:14.416 --> 35:15.983
Why did all y'all disappear?

35:16.157 --> 35:17.419
Gotta ask him that.

35:19.073 --> 35:20.770
So, Drew, what happened in 1968?

35:21.510 --> 35:23.382
Nothing a few Ws can't fix.

35:23.556 --> 35:25.514
You really think
basketball could fix

35:25.688 --> 35:27.473
what happened with
you and Big Fella?

35:27.821 --> 35:28.822
Why not?

35:30.476 --> 35:32.565
Play the game the right
way, it fixes everything.

35:33.827 --> 35:35.307
You say so.

35:37.396 --> 35:39.702
Come on, man. Okay, could
you get a jug or something?

35:44.142 --> 35:45.839
You really love
basketball, don't you?

35:47.754 --> 35:49.756
What's there not to love?

35:49.930 --> 35:52.324
Basketball's the most
reliable thing in the world.

35:53.455 --> 35:56.763
Don't complain, don't
ask any questions.

35:56.937 --> 36:00.070
You bounce it, comes
right back up.

36:01.811 --> 36:03.451
What about you, youngblood?
You ever play?

36:05.554 --> 36:06.555
Nah, not really.

36:06.990 --> 36:08.035
Why not?

36:09.210 --> 36:10.211
'Cause I don't.

36:10.385 --> 36:11.995
What's that supposed to mean?

36:12.170 --> 36:14.215
It means what I said, okay?
I just coach, all right?

36:14.389 --> 36:16.478
- I don't believe you.
- I don't play, okay?

36:18.698 --> 36:20.221
All right. Well, you're up.

36:20.395 --> 36:21.764
Wait a minute, I thought
you was the pilot.

36:21.788 --> 36:23.224
I need you to
co-pilot for a spell.

36:23.398 --> 36:24.965
Address is on the dash.

36:27.359 --> 36:28.360
Don't mess up my car.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.405
Aw, snap!

36:30.579 --> 36:32.451
Prostate ain't what
it used to be.

36:32.625 --> 36:34.453
How many times you gonna
use the bathroom?

36:34.627 --> 36:38.457
Jesus, man. Need like a
built-in toilet in his shorts.

36:38.631 --> 36:41.590
Now, please enjoy the
latest in sports.

36:41.764 --> 36:43.026
Let's go to Rucker Park

36:43.201 --> 36:44.463
where our man, Scoop Jackson

36:44.637 --> 36:46.517
is interviewing seven-time
winner, Mookie Bass.

36:46.639 --> 36:48.249
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

36:48.423 --> 36:49.966
Scoop Jackson at the
Rucker 50, Harlem, USA.

36:49.990 --> 36:51.470
Here with my man, Mookie Bass.

36:51.644 --> 36:53.385
- Damn, Mookie.
- So, why do you keep

36:53.559 --> 36:54.710
doing this, man? You have
a history of just winnin'

36:54.734 --> 36:55.885
and winnin' and winnin' this.

36:55.909 --> 36:57.606
When is it ever gonna stop?

36:57.780 --> 36:59.620
Hey, that's a great question, Scoop.
It's like,

36:59.652 --> 37:00.759
"What keeps you motivated?"
You know what I mean?

37:00.783 --> 37:02.220
And for me, it's a rivalry.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.700
Its power is derived
from rivalry, you know?

37:04.874 --> 37:06.702
-Seriously? -What is
your source of power?

37:06.876 --> 37:10.010
When Thomas Jefferson sent
car keys up in the sky,

37:10.184 --> 37:11.490
and then it got
hit by lightning,

37:11.664 --> 37:12.969
and that started the first car.

37:13.143 --> 37:14.841
This don't even make sense.

37:15.015 --> 37:16.862
Now, I'm no scientist, so
don't quote me on this.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.324
Although I do have a degree
from Trump University.

37:19.498 --> 37:23.153
But every power has a
source for that power.

37:23.328 --> 37:25.155
So, what's your source, then?

37:25.330 --> 37:27.854
He know who he is and we'll
just leave it at that.

37:28.028 --> 37:30.073
Bam!

37:30.248 --> 37:32.119
Shoutout to Pepsi.
Shoutout to Oberto.

37:32.293 --> 37:33.990
Shoutout to Aleve,

37:34.164 --> 37:35.620
the number one painkiller
in the game right now.

37:35.644 --> 37:36.644
And there it is.

37:36.732 --> 37:38.256
I'mma just get out of here.

37:38.430 --> 37:40.301
Rucker 50, Tournament
of Champions,

37:40.475 --> 37:42.192
all going down in three days,
here in Harlem. Three days.

37:42.216 --> 37:43.739
I'm coming.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.193
Three days, you going down, Dix.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.922
Damn, there's a lot of trees.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.770
Hey, man, you're not
kidnapping me, are you?

37:54.794 --> 37:56.448
I'm serious. I saw
the movieGet Out.

37:56.622 --> 37:58.062
The only reason I'm
still in this van

37:58.232 --> 38:00.392
'cause you're a old black man.
But if you was white...

38:02.584 --> 38:04.024
Drew, could you tell
your girlfriends

38:04.107 --> 38:05.195
to get across the street?

38:13.595 --> 38:15.155
Something I can help
you gentlemen with?

38:16.337 --> 38:18.252
Looking for an old friend.

38:18.426 --> 38:20.254
First name, Wilbur,
last name, Wallace.

38:20.428 --> 38:22.212
You mean, Lights?

38:22.387 --> 38:23.910
Check the D&B across the street.

38:24.084 --> 38:26.216
He likes to get his
shots up before lunch.

38:26.391 --> 38:28.306
Yeah, that is Lights.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.587
See, that's what I
am talking about.

38:29.611 --> 38:31.047
Somebody actually practicing.

38:33.702 --> 38:35.530
Oh!

38:35.704 --> 38:37.489
Yeah, that's it.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.360
- Swish!
- Oh, that was all net.

38:42.102 --> 38:44.060
- Good job.
- Boom, baby!

38:46.062 --> 38:47.542
Buckets.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.588
Girl, you should've seen
me back in the day.

38:49.762 --> 38:51.633
Whoo-hoo!

38:51.807 --> 38:53.200
Well, how'd I do?

38:53.374 --> 38:54.917
It's the highest score
of the year, Lights.

38:54.941 --> 38:56.048
That means you buying
drinks, right?

38:56.072 --> 38:57.136
That's exactly what that means.

38:57.160 --> 38:58.771
Means she's too nice to tell

38:58.945 --> 39:01.426
a old turkey like
yourself the truth.

39:01.600 --> 39:02.644
Wait a minute.

39:03.689 --> 39:04.385
Drew!

39:04.559 --> 39:06.605
- Lights.
- Drew!

39:06.779 --> 39:07.954
What's going on, man?

39:08.128 --> 39:09.323
I'm right here, I'm right here.

39:09.347 --> 39:10.173
What's going on?

39:10.348 --> 39:11.566
Okay, now.

39:11.740 --> 39:13.133
How's the release?

39:13.307 --> 39:15.135
Oh, come on, Drew. Just
get me to my spot.

39:15.309 --> 39:16.963
Once a shooter,
always a shooter.

39:17.137 --> 39:19.115
What do you mean, "Once a
shooter, always a shooter"?

39:19.139 --> 39:20.706
This dude shot
nothin' but bricks.

39:20.880 --> 39:24.710
Damn, Preach. I didn't
even notice you over here.

39:24.884 --> 39:26.538
Who else did you
roll in here with?

39:26.712 --> 39:28.278
He's right there.

39:28.453 --> 39:29.691
Hey, man. Brother! Okay,
this is my personal space.

39:29.715 --> 39:30.977
Sorry.

39:31.151 --> 39:32.587
Now, I got a question, because

39:32.761 --> 39:34.086
I've been seeing a lot
since I've been here.

39:34.110 --> 39:35.110
Are you blind?

39:35.242 --> 39:36.983
Legally or actually?

39:37.157 --> 39:39.289
That don't even make any...
You know something?

39:39.464 --> 39:41.422
I'mma... I'mma chill out.

39:41.596 --> 39:43.196
Drew, can I talk to
you for five seconds?

39:43.250 --> 39:45.078
Yeah, yeah. You chill out.

39:45.252 --> 39:46.906
Trying to find my boy, Boots.

39:47.080 --> 39:49.778
Oh, I'm Maya. Boots
is my grandfather.

39:49.952 --> 39:52.912
Oh. Boots. Great
to meet you, Maya.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.435
Where's the little
shrimp, anyway?

39:55.349 --> 39:57.917
Not good, Drew. Not good.

40:00.267 --> 40:01.355
Grandpa.

40:02.791 --> 40:05.533
Grandpa, you have some
friends here to see you.

40:08.101 --> 40:09.711
Right over there.
You want to say hi?

40:22.855 --> 40:24.204
Heads up, little man.

40:24.378 --> 40:26.511
Yeah. O.G.

40:26.685 --> 40:28.687
- He still got it.
- Yeah.

40:29.470 --> 40:30.602
There he is.

40:30.776 --> 40:33.343
How you doing, Boots? Ah, man.

40:35.911 --> 40:37.826
Band back together, huh?

40:39.698 --> 40:41.308
Nah, I love you, too, bro.

40:41.482 --> 40:43.702
It's good to see you now.

40:43.876 --> 40:46.574
Hey, little lady,
everything okay?

40:46.748 --> 40:48.588
It's just been years since
he smiled like that,

40:48.750 --> 40:50.709
and even longer since
he tried to stand.

40:50.883 --> 40:53.842
Excuse me. You said this man
hasn't walked in years?

40:54.016 --> 40:55.540
Yeah. A lot of years.

40:55.714 --> 40:57.126
Look here, Drew. I ain't
trying to break up

40:57.150 --> 40:58.519
your bromance,
brother, but, come on.

40:58.543 --> 40:59.935
It's no time for
that, youngblood.

41:00.109 --> 41:01.783
Gotta get Boots here
packed and ready to go.

41:01.807 --> 41:04.331
I'm sorry. Packed for what
and ready to go where?

41:04.505 --> 41:05.787
You didn't think
that we was gonna

41:05.811 --> 41:07.091
leave here without him, did you?

41:07.116 --> 41:08.683
Okay, look, Drew, right?

41:08.857 --> 41:10.511
- Uncle Drew.
- Uncle Drew.

41:10.685 --> 41:12.805
Can I just talk to you for a
second over here, please?

41:13.471 --> 41:14.752
Okay, here's the deal.
I am all for him

41:14.776 --> 41:16.212
getting a break from this place

41:16.386 --> 41:18.106
'cause, quite frankly,
I could use one, too.

41:18.258 --> 41:21.870
But his doctors have him on a
full psychiatric lockdown.

41:22.044 --> 41:23.829
So, that means no trips.

41:24.003 --> 41:25.154
Just means we gotta
break him out.

41:25.178 --> 41:26.614
No, that's illegal.

41:26.788 --> 41:28.747
Break out? Do you
even hear yourself?

41:28.921 --> 41:30.313
You are insane!

41:30.488 --> 41:32.168
You're the coach, ain't you?
Figure it out.

41:33.752 --> 41:35.425
Now, look, everybody.
Just like on the court,

41:35.449 --> 41:37.277
- it's all about timing.
- Okay.

41:37.451 --> 41:38.844
And I got the plan. Here we go.

41:39.018 --> 41:40.698
Lights, I need you to
go in, and I need you

41:40.759 --> 41:42.848
to distract these
nurses here and here.

41:43.022 --> 41:44.414
Once that happens, Preacher,

41:44.589 --> 41:46.765
I need you to go in and penetrate.
Right?

41:46.939 --> 41:48.979
All the way to the psych
ward and set a back pick...

41:49.115 --> 41:50.527
- What is a back pick?
- On the security guard.

41:50.551 --> 41:51.833
But make sure you do
that, a good pick.

41:51.857 --> 41:53.423
A good forward does a good pick,

41:53.598 --> 41:55.164
and that's what I
need you to do.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.925
Once that happens, Drew,
you're my all-star, brother.

41:56.949 --> 41:58.341
I need you to sneak in there,

41:58.516 --> 42:00.648
right, and get Boots
undiscreetly...

42:00.822 --> 42:02.084
- Undiscreetly?
- Take him to

42:02.258 --> 42:03.366
the freight elevator all
the way to the roof.

42:03.390 --> 42:04.913
You know he's in a wheelchair?

42:05.087 --> 42:06.151
Once you get to the roof,
guess who's there? Me.

42:06.175 --> 42:07.437
Your boy. I'mma have a rope...

42:07.612 --> 42:08.937
- Rope?
- What do we do with that rope?

42:08.961 --> 42:10.416
We tie the rope securely
on the wheelchair.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.659
We will lower him down

42:11.833 --> 42:13.313
- nice and slow...
- Whoa, lower?

42:13.487 --> 42:14.619
Until...

42:15.402 --> 42:17.360
Who is it?

42:17.535 --> 42:19.058
You know, I don't
mind you being here,

42:19.232 --> 42:20.755
but I had to draw all this up

42:20.929 --> 42:22.670
for you just to roll
down here on your own?

42:22.844 --> 42:24.280
Look, just get in the van.

42:30.330 --> 42:31.810
Pure magic.

42:35.248 --> 42:37.206
Think I don't know what
you're up to, little man?

42:37.380 --> 42:38.730
You think you're
slick, don't you?

42:38.904 --> 42:41.167
This ain't nothing but
a full-court press.

42:41.994 --> 42:44.562
I'll just take your rook, boom!

42:50.219 --> 42:53.048
Hold up. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

42:53.222 --> 42:54.615
Run that back, man.

42:54.789 --> 42:55.897
Run that back. Double
or nothing this time.

42:55.921 --> 42:57.662
Double or nothing this time.

42:57.836 --> 42:59.316
So, you sure you
really wanna do this?

42:59.446 --> 43:01.056
You know, this van is
full of old people,

43:01.230 --> 43:03.276
and it's already smelling
like pee and Poligrip.

43:03.450 --> 43:08.063
That is true. But I wanna see
my grandpa happy, you know?

43:08.237 --> 43:09.761
Why do they call
your grandpa Boots?

43:09.935 --> 43:11.240
Well, it's an interesting story.

43:11.414 --> 43:12.914
He wore the same worn
out pair of kicks

43:12.938 --> 43:14.306
every time he stepped
foot on the court.

43:14.330 --> 43:15.941
He refused to play
in anything else.

43:16.115 --> 43:18.857
He would tell people that
they were his work boots.

43:19.988 --> 43:21.183
You know, I think
it's really sweet

43:21.207 --> 43:22.861
what you're doing for them.

43:23.035 --> 43:25.080
We all need something
to look forward to,

43:25.254 --> 43:26.995
even if it is just a pipe dream.

43:27.169 --> 43:30.172
What do you mean, pipe dream?
Uncle Drew is the real deal.

43:30.346 --> 43:32.627
Yeah, but you don't actually
think they could win, do you?

43:32.740 --> 43:34.220
I mean, that's what
makes it so sweet,

43:34.394 --> 43:36.135
is that you're doing it anyway.

43:36.309 --> 43:37.527
You're basically just setting

43:37.702 --> 43:40.530
$5,000 on fire to
see them happy.

43:42.837 --> 43:45.535
If you ask me,
that's pretty noble.

43:45.710 --> 43:49.670
Exactly who I am, you know?
Dax the Noble.

43:53.326 --> 43:56.068
We got a blind guy, a guy
who can't even walk,

43:56.242 --> 43:58.592
and a preacher who still
keep a perm in his head.

43:58.766 --> 44:00.115
What's wrong with this next guy?

44:00.289 --> 44:01.595
You wanna tell him or should we?

44:01.769 --> 44:03.075
Tell me what?

44:03.249 --> 44:04.642
Don't even worry about it.

44:04.816 --> 44:06.513
Oh. Sure you don't want
us to go with you?

44:06.687 --> 44:09.603
Some songs are best sung solo.

44:09.777 --> 44:12.737
Dibs on the van if he
actually kills you.

44:18.656 --> 44:20.005
Hold stance.

44:29.057 --> 44:31.059
Remember, my young grasshoppers,

44:31.233 --> 44:32.757
without the proper focus,

44:32.931 --> 44:34.771
you will never truly
master your mind and body.

44:34.933 --> 44:36.064
Yes, Sifu.

44:38.806 --> 44:40.460
It is also important
to remember,

44:40.634 --> 44:44.029
without a good defense,
your offense means nothing.

44:44.203 --> 44:46.335
Yes, Sifu.

44:46.509 --> 44:49.251
Now, go in peace.
Get out of here.

44:56.606 --> 44:59.044
Look like a scene out
of Game of Death.

44:59.218 --> 45:01.394
All these years, and you
still ain't figured out

45:01.568 --> 45:04.179
that the best defense
is good offense, huh?

45:04.353 --> 45:05.633
It's good to see you, Big Fella.

45:07.095 --> 45:08.203
- Oh, my God, they're fighting.
- What happened?

45:08.227 --> 45:09.227
- Okay.
- Go get him.

45:09.271 --> 45:10.316
Drew got knocked out, man.

45:11.926 --> 45:13.232
I got to be the getaway driver.

45:13.406 --> 45:15.451
I brought my driving gloves.

45:15.625 --> 45:16.801
That dude is a giant.

45:16.975 --> 45:19.325
Best drop step in the business.

45:21.022 --> 45:23.372
Sup, Big Fella?

45:23.546 --> 45:25.810
That sucker punch is the first
free throw you ever made.

45:30.075 --> 45:31.772
Putting the team back together.

45:31.946 --> 45:34.340
I can't do that unless
you're on board.

45:34.514 --> 45:36.646
How about we play
one-on-one for it?

45:36.821 --> 45:40.302
Can't always play your
way out your problems.

45:40.476 --> 45:41.956
It's worked out
pretty good so far.

45:42.130 --> 45:43.784
- Has it though?
- Okay, okay. Hey, hey.

45:43.958 --> 45:44.958
Time out!

45:45.046 --> 45:46.526
Large karate man, excuse me.

45:46.700 --> 45:49.050
You look like Wolverine's
grandfather.

45:49.224 --> 45:50.984
That's none of my business,
that's your look.

45:51.052 --> 45:54.055
Okay, I get it. Uncle
Drew is annoying.

45:54.229 --> 45:57.232
He's been getting on my
nerves for the last few days.

45:57.406 --> 45:59.539
So, you don't have to do
this for him, that's cool.

45:59.713 --> 46:01.193
But what about the
rest of these cats?

46:01.367 --> 46:03.064
One last time around
the block, Big Fella.

46:03.238 --> 46:04.238
What about Lights?

46:04.283 --> 46:05.414
In the van with Boots.

46:05.588 --> 46:06.588
Boots?

46:14.380 --> 46:15.773
I'll sweeten the deal for you.

46:15.947 --> 46:17.775
You can do whatever
you want to this man.

46:17.949 --> 46:19.428
- Wait, what?
- You can slap him,

46:19.602 --> 46:21.953
you could karate chop him,
you can nunchuck him.

46:22.127 --> 46:23.693
Knock him out again, kick him.

46:23.868 --> 46:27.045
Okay, you can have a step
show on his old ass body.

46:27.219 --> 46:29.699
I don't care. But come
play with us, man.

46:30.831 --> 46:32.006
Come on, man.

46:38.360 --> 46:41.450
I mean, what does that mean in kung fu?
Is that a yes?

46:41.624 --> 46:43.148
Yeah, he's coming.

46:43.322 --> 46:46.281
Yes. We got a giant on our team!

46:46.455 --> 46:48.631
And I hope he can
play basketball.

46:48.806 --> 46:50.329
Hey, man, what are
you doing, man?

46:50.503 --> 46:51.697
You ain't supposed to
be behind the wheel.

46:51.721 --> 46:53.027
I'm the getaway driver.

46:53.201 --> 46:54.526
What you mean, you
the getaway driver?

46:54.550 --> 46:55.638
Dude, we ain't rob a bank.

46:55.813 --> 46:57.249
I got this, young
fella, I got this.

46:57.423 --> 46:58.859
Oh, come on now, Lights,

46:59.033 --> 47:00.271
you know you're not
supposed to be driving.

47:00.295 --> 47:01.993
Come on, man. Not
even a block or two?

47:02.167 --> 47:03.951
No, no, you can't drive.

47:06.475 --> 47:07.650
Is that who I think it is?

47:10.653 --> 47:12.481
Where the hell she come from?

47:12.655 --> 47:14.657
- What's happening? What?
- Betty Lou is happening.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.032
- Come on.
- Why are we scared?

47:16.181 --> 47:17.621
- Who is Betty Lou?
- That's my wife.

47:17.660 --> 47:19.140
I wasn't supposed
to leave the house.

47:19.314 --> 47:21.031
Come on, Lights. You gotta
get out the car now.

47:21.055 --> 47:22.895
- Drew, it's stuck.
- Wait, where is Big Fella?

47:23.057 --> 47:24.232
Come on, we gotta move.

47:24.406 --> 47:25.686
Shut up, I'm not talking to you.

47:25.843 --> 47:27.123
Come on now, Betty Lou's coming.

47:27.235 --> 47:28.584
- Who?
- Betty Lou's coming.

47:29.150 --> 47:31.022
I'm gonna kill him.

47:31.196 --> 47:32.695
Lights, don't worry
about the seat belt.

47:32.719 --> 47:34.416
- I can drive?
- Gas it before she kill us!

47:34.590 --> 47:35.611
Not a scratch, you hear me?

47:35.635 --> 47:36.679
I got you, Drew.

47:40.770 --> 47:42.163
- Buckle up.
- Punch it, fool!

47:42.337 --> 47:43.512
Whoo-hoo!

47:43.686 --> 47:44.949
You're going the wrong way!

47:45.123 --> 47:46.776
You're going in reverse!

47:46.951 --> 47:49.344
Lights, turn, turn!

47:51.564 --> 47:53.305
Lights!

47:53.479 --> 47:54.741
One voice, all right?

47:54.915 --> 47:56.786
Ears can't take all
that hollering.

47:59.354 --> 48:01.356
Incoming!

48:03.968 --> 48:05.815
You got a old pickup to your left.
Just curl around it

48:05.839 --> 48:07.279
like you're jumping
off to your spot.

48:11.758 --> 48:12.758
Brace for impact!

48:17.503 --> 48:18.939
Jesus, take the wheel.

48:19.113 --> 48:20.593
- Pull over!
- No!

48:20.767 --> 48:22.725
You don't know who you're
messing with, hobbit!

48:22.900 --> 48:24.727
I'm not a hobbit, lady!
I'm a man!

48:27.426 --> 48:29.384
Hit the freeway! She won't
drive on no highway!

48:30.211 --> 48:31.473
Spin it to win it.

48:31.647 --> 48:33.171
What?

48:45.748 --> 48:47.446
Oh, y'all want me
to keep driving?

48:47.620 --> 48:49.100
No!

48:49.274 --> 48:51.015
I thought I did okay myself.

49:01.112 --> 49:02.417
Here goes nothing.

49:16.779 --> 49:19.260
Let's go, ladies. On the bus.
On the bus.

49:19.434 --> 49:21.088
Hey, hey, Coach. Excuse me.

49:21.262 --> 49:22.862
How you doin', man?
Dax Winslow, brother.

49:23.003 --> 49:24.526
Are these girls just
wearing uniforms

49:24.700 --> 49:26.833
just to be wearing them?
Or are they any good?

49:28.226 --> 49:29.705
You're not from
around here, are you?

49:29.879 --> 49:32.882
Two time, back-to-back
state champions.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.754
I got $100 that say my guys

49:34.928 --> 49:38.062
right here could destroy
these prom queens.

49:38.236 --> 49:40.499
You got life insurance
policies on these guys, right?

49:40.673 --> 49:43.023
Hopefully, you got their
parents' permission.

49:43.197 --> 49:46.200
It would be impolite of
me not to take your bet.

49:46.896 --> 49:49.160
- $100, man.
- Sold.

49:49.334 --> 49:51.510
Look, guys, we need
to practice, okay?

49:51.684 --> 49:53.599
What do you mean? Right now?

49:53.773 --> 49:55.577
Look, this might be the
only opportunity we get.

49:55.601 --> 49:56.950
What about Grandpa?

49:57.124 --> 49:58.734
You know he can't
actually play, right?

49:58.908 --> 50:00.538
Yeah, I figured the little
hobbit could take his spot.

50:00.562 --> 50:02.608
Look here, Papa Smurf, okay?
Nobody asked you.

50:02.782 --> 50:04.325
And, look, if we just gotta
play with four people,

50:04.349 --> 50:05.872
then we'll do just four-on-four.

50:06.046 --> 50:08.962
We got one day, one damn
day, until the Rucker.

50:09.136 --> 50:12.096
We need to be prepared.
Meet me outside, guys.

50:12.270 --> 50:13.836
Come on, Big Fella.

50:14.011 --> 50:15.534
Let's go, Trojans.
Match up, now.

50:18.102 --> 50:19.538
Pass the ball.

50:19.712 --> 50:21.496
I'm open! Pass the ball!

50:21.670 --> 50:23.237
Yeah, Preach.

50:23.411 --> 50:24.195
Oh, yeah.

50:24.369 --> 50:25.718
Make it rain!

50:25.892 --> 50:27.633
That's a ladies' ball.

50:28.634 --> 50:29.634
I'm open.

50:33.247 --> 50:34.379
Come on.

50:37.773 --> 50:38.773
Wait a minute.

50:40.428 --> 50:41.821
Come on, guys, come on!

50:41.995 --> 50:43.823
- Get down.
- Pass the ball.

50:43.997 --> 50:47.000
- Hurry up!
- Move those old bodies!

50:47.174 --> 50:48.306
Let me get some of that.

50:49.220 --> 50:50.569
Wave me over. Match up.

50:50.743 --> 50:52.223
Up top, up top.

50:52.397 --> 50:53.920
Oh, this is bringing
back memories now!

50:54.399 --> 50:56.401
- Got this.
- Goddamn!

50:56.575 --> 50:57.575
Big Fella!

50:58.142 --> 50:59.143
You mother...

51:01.841 --> 51:03.384
Not exactly what you
were expecting, huh?

51:03.408 --> 51:04.670
No, they are garbage.

51:04.844 --> 51:06.367
Yeah, but they're smiling.

51:06.541 --> 51:08.804
I mean, that's gotta count
for something, right?

51:08.978 --> 51:10.110
Look at these guys. I mean,

51:10.284 --> 51:11.459
Lights couldn't make a basket

51:11.633 --> 51:13.070
if he had a braille trail to it.

51:13.244 --> 51:14.636
Raindrop!

51:14.810 --> 51:16.450
Big Fella and Uncle
Drew, they're talkin'.

51:16.595 --> 51:18.640
- You're not open to me.
- Pass the ball, Kobe.

51:18.814 --> 51:19.946
Come on, guys!

51:20.120 --> 51:21.469
I got it.

51:21.643 --> 51:23.950
Lights out, baby. Wait a minute.

51:24.124 --> 51:25.908
You see? That's good basketball.

51:26.083 --> 51:27.443
Barbeque chicken,
barbeque chicken.

51:27.562 --> 51:29.042
Lobster in the house.

51:29.216 --> 51:30.739
Big Fella! There you go!
There you go!

51:32.089 --> 51:33.525
Better step out.

51:34.656 --> 51:36.528
- Come on.
- Time out!

51:36.702 --> 51:37.809
See the way they move
without the ball?

51:37.833 --> 51:39.008
They're all connected as one.

51:39.183 --> 51:40.532
Reminds me of us
back in the day.

51:40.706 --> 51:42.229
Of us?

51:42.403 --> 51:44.283
If they score one more
point, fellas, that's it.

51:44.405 --> 51:46.285
Come on, Drew, you told
me these dudes can play.

51:46.320 --> 51:47.680
This guy right here
can't even see.

51:47.843 --> 51:49.203
Look, I'm standing
here doing this.

51:49.367 --> 51:50.735
He don't even know I'm doing that.
Okay?

51:50.759 --> 51:52.631
And this dude,
he's a karate man.

51:52.805 --> 51:54.502
He's meditating right now.

51:54.676 --> 51:56.896
Y'all gotta get it together.
Drew, it's on you now, man.

51:57.070 --> 51:59.246
Stop passing the ball.

51:59.420 --> 52:02.510
You are the lead singer,
the leader of this team.

52:02.684 --> 52:04.684
You are Gladys Knight and
these dudes are the Pips.

52:04.817 --> 52:07.298
It's just a scrimmage, youngblood.
That's all it is.

52:07.472 --> 52:09.604
It's not just a scrimmage! Okay?

52:11.345 --> 52:12.955
Look, I bet $100 on the game.

52:13.130 --> 52:14.490
- What?
- What am I supposed to do?

52:14.609 --> 52:16.220
Man, we don't have
no more gas left.

52:16.394 --> 52:18.328
We're just runnin' on fumes.
What you want me to do?

52:18.352 --> 52:20.093
Look, guys, they need to score

52:20.267 --> 52:21.877
one more time. Just stop 'em.

52:22.051 --> 52:23.531
You're really tall.

52:23.705 --> 52:25.425
Just put your arms up,
they're little girls.

52:32.453 --> 52:33.585
Come on, man!

52:35.674 --> 52:40.853
Good job, guys. Stayin' alive, breathing.
Good effort.

52:41.027 --> 52:42.811
Great teamwork, girls.
Great teamwork.

52:42.985 --> 52:44.552
Good game, good game.

52:44.726 --> 52:45.727
Good game, ladies.

52:47.468 --> 52:49.253
Hey, Coach.

52:49.427 --> 52:50.950
Pleasure doing
business with you.

52:54.954 --> 52:57.086
Yeah. Me and the
fellas teamed up

52:57.261 --> 52:58.479
to take care of that for you.

52:59.567 --> 53:00.873
I just don't understand

53:01.047 --> 53:02.567
why you ain't ask us
for the gas money?

53:04.093 --> 53:07.271
It's not a big deal.
Just had to tell us.

53:07.445 --> 53:08.924
And, remember,

53:09.098 --> 53:11.231
Gladys Knight ain't
nothing without the Pips.

53:18.499 --> 53:21.198
Listen, Drew, I really
appreciate you guys

53:21.372 --> 53:23.635
having my back
back there, right?

53:23.809 --> 53:25.265
But that doesn't take
away from the fact

53:25.289 --> 53:26.409
that we got our butts kicked

53:26.464 --> 53:27.856
by some teenage girls.

53:28.030 --> 53:29.641
Matter of fact, maybe
we should look

53:29.815 --> 53:31.935
- to get some more players.
- Forget that, youngblood.

53:33.079 --> 53:34.863
My roster, my team.

53:42.306 --> 53:43.568
Mind if we talk for a minute?

53:46.832 --> 53:48.766
I was thinking about the way
we used to run pick and roll.

53:48.790 --> 53:50.227
Might make sense if...

53:55.493 --> 53:56.494
Fine.

53:58.844 --> 54:00.237
Everything good
back there, Preach?

54:00.411 --> 54:02.848
Just thinking about
my Betty Lou is all.

54:04.371 --> 54:06.460
You'll be back in her
arms before you know it.

54:40.189 --> 54:42.322
Yes! It may have took
us a while to get here,

54:42.496 --> 54:45.499
but we are finally
here at the Rucker.

54:45.673 --> 54:47.193
Some of the greatest
basketball players

54:47.240 --> 54:48.981
you've ever seen have
played in this...

54:49.155 --> 54:51.113
You mind giving us a
minute, youngblood?

54:52.898 --> 54:55.204
Okay. Sure.

54:58.077 --> 54:59.296
We're here, fellas.

55:01.254 --> 55:02.386
Oh, man.

55:05.519 --> 55:07.565
I played on damn near
every outdoor court

55:07.739 --> 55:09.262
in the country over the years,

55:09.436 --> 55:11.133
but battling between the lines,

55:11.308 --> 55:13.962
with you fellas here,
always felt like home.

55:14.136 --> 55:16.356
Feel you, Drew. I feel you.

55:17.792 --> 55:19.707
I got each of you a
little something.

55:24.016 --> 55:26.975
Now, I know you never liked
the way they looked,

55:27.149 --> 55:30.022
but Doc put a lens in
there for a reason.

55:34.200 --> 55:35.549
Take your time, now.

55:35.723 --> 55:37.986
Now, go help him put it on.
Put it on.

55:43.818 --> 55:45.820
Why didn't y'all say anything?

55:48.562 --> 55:53.132
Man, y'all look so... So old.

55:53.306 --> 55:54.873
I think he can see.

55:55.047 --> 55:59.617
And, Preach. That face!

55:59.791 --> 56:02.881
I can see! Lights out, baby!

56:03.055 --> 56:04.752
Whoo-hoo!

56:04.926 --> 56:08.452
Oh, yeah! Yeah, Drew.

56:08.626 --> 56:10.932
Welcome home, Lights.
Welcome home.

56:12.107 --> 56:14.153
I know you remember this one.

56:14.327 --> 56:16.547
Gave it to me when we was nine.

56:17.939 --> 56:19.201
You told me...

56:19.376 --> 56:20.701
Told you it would
give you a strength

56:20.725 --> 56:22.248
you didn't even
know that you had.

56:22.422 --> 56:26.121
And it did. Now it's your turn.

56:38.786 --> 56:41.615
Oh, come finish this, Preach.
Come finish it.

56:41.789 --> 56:43.008
All right, Preacher!

56:43.182 --> 56:44.966
Aw, yeah, baby.

56:45.140 --> 56:47.839
Boots, you ain't think I
forgot about you, did you?

56:48.970 --> 56:50.972
Left 'em back in the van in '68.

56:51.146 --> 56:53.186
Figured they might still got
a little spring to 'em.

56:58.371 --> 56:59.416
Yeah.

57:01.200 --> 57:02.897
Just like you left 'em. Hmm?

57:10.252 --> 57:11.252
I love you, too, bruh.

57:12.951 --> 57:14.474
Easy now.

57:14.648 --> 57:16.128
Let's see if they fit
before you start

57:16.258 --> 57:18.217
going and getting all
emotional on me.

57:33.624 --> 57:34.668
No, wait. Is he...

57:36.365 --> 57:37.715
He can't get up. He...

57:45.374 --> 57:46.898
Yeah. Yeah.

57:47.725 --> 57:49.074
Oh, nice.

57:50.858 --> 57:52.860
Look as good as the first
time you put 'em on.

58:00.477 --> 58:01.826
Yeah.

58:02.000 --> 58:03.305
Yeah, Bootsie!

58:05.569 --> 58:07.396
That's it, Boots. That's it.

58:07.571 --> 58:11.313
Kinda like breathing. Couldn't
forget how even if you tried.

58:18.364 --> 58:20.235
I saved the best for last.

58:24.370 --> 58:26.067
Brick City Two-on-Two
Tournament,

58:26.241 --> 58:27.721
when we was 15 years old.

58:27.895 --> 58:30.245
First tournament we
ever won together.

58:44.956 --> 58:46.174
Yeah.

58:51.528 --> 58:53.138
This ain't no apology.

58:53.312 --> 58:54.531
Don't even try it.

59:03.540 --> 59:06.020
Big Fella. Big Fella.

59:13.288 --> 59:15.508
Hey, Jess. Come on, open up, it's me.
It's Dax.

59:15.682 --> 59:16.727
Yeah, I got a team now.

59:16.901 --> 59:18.729
I really think we got a chance.

59:18.903 --> 59:21.470
Did it ever occur to
you to call first?

59:21.645 --> 59:23.124
It did occur to
me to call first.

59:23.298 --> 59:25.779
But I couldn't because you
cut my cell phone off.

59:25.953 --> 59:28.608
That's because I broke up
with your pathetic ass.

59:28.782 --> 59:30.262
But you know what?

59:30.436 --> 59:32.830
My new boyfriend, he
took care of everything.

59:33.004 --> 59:34.416
Wait, what you mean, you
got a new boyfriend?

59:34.440 --> 59:35.440
We just broke up...

59:36.747 --> 59:38.487
Hey, what's up?

59:38.662 --> 59:40.054
What's that facial expression?

59:40.228 --> 59:42.230
You look like someone
just took your girl.

59:42.404 --> 59:43.754
Oh, that's right.

59:43.928 --> 59:45.383
Oh, I think that's
what happened, though.

59:45.407 --> 59:46.670
Yeah.

59:46.844 --> 59:48.280
Sorry we couldn't
hear you knocking

59:48.454 --> 59:50.108
- 'cause we was in the shower.
- Mmm-hmm.

59:50.282 --> 59:51.564
We weren't gettin'
clean, were we?

59:51.588 --> 59:53.154
No, we weren't.

59:53.328 --> 59:55.374
- No, we were getting dirty.
- Dirty. You so dirty.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.332
Y'all know I'm
standing here, right?

59:57.506 --> 59:58.875
Can I just get my uniforms
and get out of here?

59:58.899 --> 59:59.900
- Uniforms?
- Uniforms.

01:00:00.074 --> 01:00:01.162
- How come?
- I got a team.

01:00:01.336 --> 01:00:02.686
- You got a team?
- Yes.

01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:05.645
- Aw, that's cute, bruh.
- Mmm-hmm.

01:00:05.819 --> 01:00:07.168
- That's real cute.
- Here ya go.

01:00:07.342 --> 01:00:09.823
Good luck. Hey, will
you cook me breakfast?

01:00:09.997 --> 01:00:11.317
Mmm, I'll make you
an omelet, boo.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:13.218
Oh, I'mma scramble your eggs.

01:00:13.392 --> 01:00:15.568
Welcome, ladies and
gentlemen, boys and girls,

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:17.875
to the Rucker 50th
Tournament of Champions.

01:00:18.049 --> 01:00:20.355
I am yours truly, Duke Tango.

01:00:20.529 --> 01:00:22.619
Today we bring you
the best of the best

01:00:22.793 --> 01:00:26.057
of the Rucker crowd
and $100,000.

01:00:26.231 --> 01:00:28.233
That's right, $100,000,

01:00:28.407 --> 01:00:32.063
and it's all here
in Harlem, US of A!

01:00:32.237 --> 01:00:33.760
This is where it happens.

01:00:33.934 --> 01:00:35.762
This will make you,
this will break you.

01:00:35.936 --> 01:00:38.069
Here we go! Game one.

01:00:38.243 --> 01:00:40.549
Hilltop Mavericks versus
Homecourt Advantage.

01:00:40.724 --> 01:00:43.683
Let's do this! Let's do this!
Oh, yeah!

01:01:22.330 --> 01:01:24.289
It's one of those days

01:01:24.463 --> 01:01:25.769
when the crowd is a little thin.

01:01:29.686 --> 01:01:33.298
Now, is it me or is
it empty in here?

01:01:33.472 --> 01:01:35.126
Nah, Preach, it ain't you.

01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:38.172
We used to ball out in front
of twice as many people.

01:01:38.346 --> 01:01:39.946
Youngblood, I don't
know about this name.

01:01:40.044 --> 01:01:41.698
Bruh, I'm straight
from Chocolate City.

01:01:41.872 --> 01:01:43.458
Yeah, I think, guys, it's more
about where we are now...

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:45.614
Stop! Look, it's not
about the name.

01:01:45.789 --> 01:01:48.095
We don't have a
fifth player, guys.

01:01:48.269 --> 01:01:50.030
If we don't get nobody
else, we gotta forfeit.

01:01:50.054 --> 01:01:51.490
We need Big Fella.
Where is he at?

01:01:51.664 --> 01:01:53.013
He'll be here.

01:01:53.187 --> 01:01:55.276
Yeah, but what if he's not?

01:01:55.450 --> 01:01:57.278
I'm pretty sure those
basketball shoes.

01:01:57.452 --> 01:01:59.411
Although, your
calf-to-shoe ratio

01:01:59.585 --> 01:02:00.934
is not all that great.

01:02:01.108 --> 01:02:02.303
Yeah, and his body's really bad.

01:02:02.327 --> 01:02:03.807
It's not built for jumping.

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:04.677
Okay. Okay. Let me tell
y'all something...

01:02:04.851 --> 01:02:06.200
I don't play basketball.

01:02:06.374 --> 01:02:08.637
And, yes, my calves
don't match my body.

01:02:08.812 --> 01:02:10.452
I done had these calves
since I was seven.

01:02:10.509 --> 01:02:12.226
Went to a doctor, saw
somebody, and he was, like,

01:02:12.250 --> 01:02:13.444
"Hey, man, we don't know
what we can do about it."

01:02:13.468 --> 01:02:15.601
Yes! He is here.

01:02:15.775 --> 01:02:19.387
The Black Messiah. Grandfather.
Okay.

01:02:19.561 --> 01:02:20.921
- Don't. He is here...
- He's here.

01:02:21.041 --> 01:02:22.062
Everybody get on the court.

01:02:22.086 --> 01:02:24.001
Let's go.

01:02:28.309 --> 01:02:30.050
What are you doing? Move!

01:02:30.224 --> 01:02:31.332
Something you wanna say to me?

01:02:31.356 --> 01:02:33.184
We're in the middle of a game!

01:02:33.358 --> 01:02:34.552
Can we get some help out here?

01:02:34.576 --> 01:02:36.404
I don't know what's going on

01:02:36.578 --> 01:02:37.405
at the half court position,
but it ain't helping 'em.

01:02:37.579 --> 01:02:38.929
Are they fighting?

01:02:39.103 --> 01:02:40.254
I'm not running down
until you say it.

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:41.540
- Say what?
- You know what.

01:02:41.714 --> 01:02:42.889
I'm not talking about her.

01:02:43.063 --> 01:02:43.803
Hey, hey, hey, timeout.

01:02:43.977 --> 01:02:46.153
Yo, yo, yo! Hey, hey.

01:02:46.327 --> 01:02:48.044
Come here, bring it in.
What are you two doing?

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:49.591
I ain't run out on my old lady

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:50.549
just so we can come out
here and play like this.

01:02:50.723 --> 01:02:52.072
I'm out.

01:02:52.246 --> 01:02:53.354
Hey, nah, you're not
going nowhere, Drew.

01:02:53.378 --> 01:02:54.727
You will stay right here.

01:02:54.901 --> 01:02:56.183
And I don't know what
you two are doing.

01:02:56.207 --> 01:02:57.487
You said you wanna
teach the kids

01:02:57.599 --> 01:02:59.340
how to play the
game the right way.

01:02:59.514 --> 01:03:01.536
But this is not the right way,
arguin' with your teammate.

01:03:01.560 --> 01:03:04.519
Let's play some basketball!
We are a team.

01:03:04.693 --> 01:03:06.870
Bring it in, guys. Come on.

01:03:07.044 --> 01:03:09.524
Whatever y'all got going on,
work it out after the game.

01:03:09.698 --> 01:03:12.571
Bring it in. Harlem
Money on three.

01:03:12.745 --> 01:03:13.485
- One...
- Let's go get this money, man.

01:03:13.659 --> 01:03:14.659
Come on.

01:03:15.617 --> 01:03:17.141
Well, just play.

01:03:17.315 --> 01:03:18.315
Back to live action,

01:03:18.446 --> 01:03:19.447
here we go!

01:03:19.621 --> 01:03:21.362
This is Boots with the ball.

01:03:21.536 --> 01:03:25.497
Over to my man, Uncle. Uncle Drew, yes!
Uncle Drew!

01:03:25.671 --> 01:03:27.934
This is The Mosquito
with the handle.

01:03:28.108 --> 01:03:30.241
Oh, no, no, no! Steal
away for Uncle!

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:33.505
Look at the handle.

01:03:37.944 --> 01:03:39.990
75 years old and still
can't admit it.

01:03:47.258 --> 01:03:48.694
Selfish son of a bitch.

01:03:48.868 --> 01:03:51.697
Uncle Drew doing it once again.

01:03:53.612 --> 01:03:56.833
It's the third period, baby.
The Uncle Drew Show continues.

01:04:06.103 --> 01:04:08.105
Harlem Money is running
away with this one.

01:04:08.279 --> 01:04:10.847
Another basket and they will
be going to the next round.

01:04:11.021 --> 01:04:12.694
How come you just can't
admit you messed up?

01:04:12.718 --> 01:04:13.850
We hardly even knew her.

01:04:14.024 --> 01:04:15.088
Matter of fact, I bet you can't

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.287
even remember her dang name.

01:04:16.461 --> 01:04:17.854
You don't remember
her dang name?

01:04:20.465 --> 01:04:21.640
I married her, punk.

01:04:26.384 --> 01:04:28.473
Come on, baby. Come on.

01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:29.953
You really wanna
make this right?

01:04:30.127 --> 01:04:31.432
Stop running from the truth.

01:04:49.059 --> 01:04:50.099
Can't believe you ended up

01:04:50.147 --> 01:04:52.149
marrying her anyway.

01:04:52.323 --> 01:04:53.430
Can't believe you slept with her

01:04:53.454 --> 01:04:54.760
the night before the finals.

01:04:57.981 --> 01:04:59.199
I loved her.

01:05:00.418 --> 01:05:01.858
I don't know if you
knew this, but...

01:05:01.941 --> 01:05:03.464
Yeah, I knew.

01:05:04.509 --> 01:05:06.337
I always knew.

01:05:06.511 --> 01:05:09.644
Spent five decades
pretending like I didn't.

01:05:09.818 --> 01:05:10.970
But I saw the way
you looked at her

01:05:10.994 --> 01:05:12.517
when she walked in the park.

01:05:12.691 --> 01:05:14.301
So, why'd you do it, then?

01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.349
I loved her, too.

01:05:22.048 --> 01:05:25.051
Look, Big Fella, I'm sorry.

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:30.709
I've been sorry my
whole damn life.

01:05:32.929 --> 01:05:34.321
You mean that?

01:05:34.495 --> 01:05:36.106
I mean that with
everything I got.

01:05:39.718 --> 01:05:41.938
If I can go back and
change it, I would.

01:05:43.243 --> 01:05:44.288
Believe me.

01:05:53.166 --> 01:05:54.863
I need you to feed me.

01:05:55.429 --> 01:05:56.691
Excuse me?

01:05:56.865 --> 01:05:58.171
You may not understand this,

01:05:58.345 --> 01:06:00.521
but, uh, I can really
shoot the ball.

01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:02.959
Let the Big Fella eat, huh?

01:06:03.133 --> 01:06:05.004
Like The Last Supper, baby.

01:06:05.787 --> 01:06:07.615
Oh, too slow, too slow.

01:06:07.789 --> 01:06:09.878
Hey, that ain't no figment
of my imagination.

01:06:10.053 --> 01:06:11.663
Somebody 'bout to
eat their words.

01:06:11.837 --> 01:06:14.927
That's Drew there.
Hey, Drew, hey!

01:06:15.101 --> 01:06:17.036
Look at that face! Go ahead,
scratch and smell him.

01:06:17.060 --> 01:06:17.886
Scratch and smell him.

01:06:18.061 --> 01:06:19.714
- You real.
- Yeah.

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:22.239
He real. He real man.
This ain't no hologram.

01:06:22.413 --> 01:06:23.651
Been a minute, Angelo.
What's goin' on?

01:06:23.675 --> 01:06:25.155
Oh, been a minute.

01:06:25.329 --> 01:06:27.002
Good to see you, Drew.
Always good to see you.

01:06:27.026 --> 01:06:30.116
What you gonna do with all
that money when you win?

01:06:30.290 --> 01:06:32.989
- Come again?
- The purse. The purse, Drew.

01:06:33.163 --> 01:06:35.730
The hundred stacks of
high society at stake.

01:06:35.904 --> 01:06:37.167
You know, the duckets.

01:06:37.341 --> 01:06:38.864
Wasn't ever no purse
back in the day.

01:06:39.038 --> 01:06:40.953
No, it wasn't ever
nothin' like that.

01:06:41.127 --> 01:06:44.087
But $100,000 of cash, baby.

01:06:44.261 --> 01:06:47.655
I'd sign up, you know
what I'm saying?

01:06:52.791 --> 01:06:54.071
You think I'm
stupid, youngblood?

01:06:54.140 --> 01:06:55.881
Hundred grand is a
whole lot of money.

01:06:57.622 --> 01:06:58.816
Look, man, I was gonna
talk to you about...

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:01.365
Yeah, when? When?

01:07:01.539 --> 01:07:05.108
You just don't get it, do you, youngblood?
This game...

01:07:05.282 --> 01:07:09.982
The love I got for it,
it's all sacred to me.

01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:11.592
You told me that
you love the game.

01:07:11.766 --> 01:07:13.638
You don't love the game.

01:07:13.812 --> 01:07:16.597
You use it just like you use
everything else in your life.

01:07:16.771 --> 01:07:18.425
You ain't nothing but a hustler.

01:07:22.299 --> 01:07:24.083
Hey, man, who you
talking to, man?

01:07:24.257 --> 01:07:26.259
Hey! Talkin' to you, man.

01:07:26.433 --> 01:07:27.826
Watch your tone, youngblood.

01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.543
You don't think I got
love for this game?

01:07:29.567 --> 01:07:31.167
Don't nobody love this
game more than me.

01:07:31.308 --> 01:07:33.832
Talkin' about Jordan, 63 against Boston.
I saw that.

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:35.616
Laettner's turnaround
against Kentucky.

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.357
Bird steals the ball to win

01:07:37.531 --> 01:07:39.794
the Eastern Conference
Finals to beat the Pistons.

01:07:39.968 --> 01:07:41.970
I saw all of that
and I loved it.

01:07:42.145 --> 01:07:44.712
But guess what, the game
never loved me back.

01:07:46.932 --> 01:07:48.064
So, then what happened then?

01:07:52.851 --> 01:07:54.331
I missed a shot.

01:07:56.333 --> 01:07:57.986
I shot it, it got blocked.

01:07:59.423 --> 01:08:02.687
I was humiliated. Everybody
walked out on me.

01:08:07.779 --> 01:08:10.260
Now, that's the first real
thing you've done said.

01:08:11.043 --> 01:08:12.653
That's the real Dax.

01:08:14.916 --> 01:08:18.268
Now, come on, let's
go play this game.

01:08:18.442 --> 01:08:21.140
It's about the love,
youngblood, nothin' else.

01:08:36.850 --> 01:08:38.679
- Yes!
- Get it, Grandpa!

01:08:38.853 --> 01:08:40.899
This Big Fella. This
is the Big Fella.

01:08:42.118 --> 01:08:43.902
Ooh!

01:08:44.076 --> 01:08:45.859
Ah, shit, I'm loose.

01:08:46.033 --> 01:08:48.167
Uncle looking at it. What
he gonna do with it?

01:08:52.258 --> 01:08:54.346
- The Preacher!
- Oh, in the name of Jesus!

01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:56.087
Finally gettin' my
legs back, y'all.

01:08:57.742 --> 01:09:00.223
This is Uncle Drew to Lights.

01:09:02.616 --> 01:09:03.747
- Money!
- All right, Lights!

01:09:03.921 --> 01:09:05.358
The reason they call me Lights.

01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.102
Yeah!

01:09:11.451 --> 01:09:12.850
Don't bring your
little ass in here.

01:09:50.707 --> 01:09:52.752
- And that's it?
- That's right.

01:09:52.926 --> 01:09:56.888
You swipe right if you like
'em, left if you don't.

01:09:57.062 --> 01:09:58.977
You couldn't even see the
day before yesterday.

01:09:59.151 --> 01:10:00.413
Mmm-hmm. Exactly.

01:10:00.587 --> 01:10:02.415
That's why I'm always
swipin' right.

01:10:02.589 --> 01:10:04.200
It's more of a numbers game.

01:10:08.029 --> 01:10:10.728
Looks a little different
these days, don't it?

01:10:10.902 --> 01:10:13.426
She gonna get him pregnant if
she keep dancing like that.

01:10:14.949 --> 01:10:16.473
If I wasn't so sore,

01:10:16.647 --> 01:10:18.779
we'd get out there and
show 'em our old routine.

01:10:21.086 --> 01:10:23.306
Excuse me, son, do we amuse you?

01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:26.961
Yo, you're in the club, and
you're pushin' 80, bro.

01:10:27.135 --> 01:10:29.094
And what's up with your
boy, Frederick Douglass?

01:10:29.268 --> 01:10:30.791
Hey!

01:10:30.965 --> 01:10:33.098
Heard he was doing great things.

01:10:37.015 --> 01:10:38.016
Hold my beer.

01:10:38.190 --> 01:10:39.190
Grandpa!

01:10:39.278 --> 01:10:42.194
Don't hurt nobody, pop.

01:10:42.368 --> 01:10:45.937
Ah, yeah! Gonna get real
grody up in this joint now!

01:11:24.976 --> 01:11:26.194
Oh, my God!

01:11:39.686 --> 01:11:42.298
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:12:28.822 --> 01:12:30.583
You know somethin', man? I did
not think your grandfather

01:12:30.607 --> 01:12:32.391
would ever get up out
that wheelchair.

01:12:32.565 --> 01:12:33.740
Me neither. I heard stories,

01:12:33.914 --> 01:12:35.414
but I never knew he
could play like that.

01:12:35.438 --> 01:12:36.502
So how much your
parents paying you

01:12:36.526 --> 01:12:37.831
to watch your grandfather?

01:12:38.005 --> 01:12:39.616
Why does anybody have
to be paying me?

01:12:39.790 --> 01:12:41.724
Why can't I just enjoy
spending time with my family?

01:12:41.748 --> 01:12:43.247
Well, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

01:12:43.271 --> 01:12:44.795
'Cause I never had one. So...

01:12:44.969 --> 01:12:46.797
What do you mean you
never really had one?

01:12:46.971 --> 01:12:48.320
What do you call those guys?

01:12:57.634 --> 01:12:59.200
I honestly had a lot
of fun tonight.

01:12:59.375 --> 01:13:00.550
Me too.

01:13:05.032 --> 01:13:06.556
Well, I guess it's time to go.

01:13:06.730 --> 01:13:09.689
Yeah, we should go ahead
and get up out of...

01:13:13.606 --> 01:13:15.086
He ain't gonna do it.

01:13:16.261 --> 01:13:17.480
Hey.

01:13:17.654 --> 01:13:19.177
- Hey.
- It's you!

01:13:19.351 --> 01:13:21.092
No! Mmm-mmm.

01:13:21.266 --> 01:13:22.746
- You open!
- Take a shot!

01:13:26.010 --> 01:13:28.665
Sorry. I'mma go. I
need some water.

01:13:28.839 --> 01:13:30.928
- Sure.
- 'Cause my throat is dry.

01:13:31.102 --> 01:13:33.670
Yeah, I know how that is.
I'll take care of this.

01:13:33.844 --> 01:13:35.364
Take a gap? Thank
you, appreciate that.

01:13:35.454 --> 01:13:36.890
Yeah, yeah. Don't
worry about it.

01:13:37.064 --> 01:13:38.501
Anybody give him some training

01:13:38.675 --> 01:13:40.416
on how to talk to a lady?

01:13:42.330 --> 01:13:43.941
Okay, look, man, I
don't wanna hear that.

01:13:44.115 --> 01:13:46.422
Anything, okay? Not one
single freakin' word.

01:13:46.596 --> 01:13:48.989
Maybe she should've
taken her heels off.

01:13:49.163 --> 01:13:51.078
I'll tell ya, youngblood,
last time I checked,

01:13:51.252 --> 01:13:54.038
you miss 100% of the
shots you don't take.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:55.492
Yeah, let's get
out of here, man.

01:13:57.781 --> 01:13:58.999
Let's give him a piggyback.

01:13:59.173 --> 01:14:00.566
Big Fella, what are you doing?

01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:02.394
We'll give him a
little piggyback.

01:14:02.568 --> 01:14:04.568
That's right. Two down, two to go.
We almost there.

01:14:10.576 --> 01:14:12.926
Yo, how's that geriatric
team of yours, bro?

01:14:13.100 --> 01:14:15.407
You get 'em all individual
Life Alert bracelets?

01:14:15.581 --> 01:14:17.061
Hey, man, are you
wearing my clothes?

01:14:17.235 --> 01:14:19.063
- What?
- Yes, that's my shirt.

01:14:19.237 --> 01:14:20.456
You got on my shirt, man.

01:14:20.630 --> 01:14:22.980
That's right, I got
on your shirt.

01:14:23.154 --> 01:14:25.156
Or maybe you got my shirt on.

01:14:25.330 --> 01:14:27.245
- What? Wait, wait.
- What? Wait, wait.

01:14:27.419 --> 01:14:28.899
- That's my shirt.
- That's my shirt.

01:14:29.073 --> 01:14:30.746
- You got on my clothes.
- You got on my clothes.

01:14:30.770 --> 01:14:32.356
- Stop it! You're crazy.
- Stop it! You're crazy.

01:14:32.380 --> 01:14:35.340
That's right. I'm crazy.
I'm being you.

01:14:35.514 --> 01:14:37.298
The only way to
defeat one's enemy

01:14:37.473 --> 01:14:38.909
is to become one's enemy.

01:14:40.606 --> 01:14:41.726
- You're nuts!
- You're nuts!

01:14:43.696 --> 01:14:45.524
- You're psycho!
- You're psycho!

01:14:45.698 --> 01:14:49.572
I'll see you in the finals, Dax.
Psycho.

01:15:08.852 --> 01:15:09.983
All day.

01:15:15.336 --> 01:15:16.860
Yes! There you go, Big Fella!

01:15:17.034 --> 01:15:18.634
That's what I'm talking
about, Big Fella!

01:15:19.602 --> 01:15:21.908
Off shot! Handled it.

01:15:22.082 --> 01:15:23.562
- Good rebound!
- All right.

01:15:25.346 --> 01:15:28.219
Oh, shot, shot, shot.
Get that out of here!

01:15:28.393 --> 01:15:30.264
- What do I do, what do I do?
- Just back up.

01:15:31.918 --> 01:15:33.311
Oh, yeah. I remember this play.

01:15:34.617 --> 01:15:36.444
Too late. Got 'em.

01:15:36.619 --> 01:15:38.534
Yes! That's what I'm
talkin' about, Lights.

01:15:38.708 --> 01:15:40.100
You are the man!

01:15:41.711 --> 01:15:44.365
This is Boots. Boots
goin' down death valley!

01:15:44.540 --> 01:15:46.629
Uh-huh! Baby!

01:15:46.803 --> 01:15:49.066
Harlem Money is going
to the finals,

01:15:49.240 --> 01:15:51.677
with only seconds
left in the ballgame!

01:15:53.244 --> 01:15:55.202
- Still hungry, huh?
- Just a little dessert.

01:15:55.376 --> 01:15:57.204
Hey, take the three,
Big Fella, why not?

01:15:57.378 --> 01:15:59.555
This is to send 'em.
They're already there.

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:01.208
That's all right, Big Fella.

01:16:05.082 --> 01:16:06.562
Big Fella.

01:16:06.736 --> 01:16:08.259
Big Fella. Big Fella. Big Fella.

01:16:08.433 --> 01:16:09.956
- Somebody get a doctor.
- Big Fella.

01:16:10.740 --> 01:16:11.740
Come on!

01:16:13.264 --> 01:16:14.676
Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me.
Let me in here.

01:16:14.700 --> 01:16:16.093
The Big Fella is down.

01:16:16.267 --> 01:16:17.747
Stay here, Big Fella.
Stay in it.

01:16:17.921 --> 01:16:19.226
- Beginning CPR.
- Oh, Lord,

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:20.920
give him some room,
give him some room.

01:16:21.402 --> 01:16:22.969
You're okay, boss.

01:16:23.143 --> 01:16:26.233
Come on, Big Fella.
Come on, Big Fella.

01:16:32.413 --> 01:16:33.632
Doctor already said

01:16:33.806 --> 01:16:35.126
he's been through
the worst of it.

01:16:36.330 --> 01:16:38.811
So, what... What do we do now?

01:16:42.162 --> 01:16:44.121
You don't stop playing
'cause you get old.

01:16:45.557 --> 01:16:47.341
You get old 'cause
you stop playing.

01:16:50.301 --> 01:16:51.868
Preacher!

01:16:54.958 --> 01:16:57.264
Hi. And I'm so sorry

01:16:57.438 --> 01:16:59.615
about the Big Fella.
Is he gonna be okay?

01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:03.836
But I've been missing
you so much.

01:17:04.010 --> 01:17:05.316
Come here, come here.

01:17:05.490 --> 01:17:06.796
I missed you too, baby.

01:17:06.970 --> 01:17:09.189
Now, look.

01:17:09.363 --> 01:17:11.483
If you don't want me to go
ball, I don't have to ball.

01:17:11.583 --> 01:17:15.065
Fool, please, after all this?
You're playing.

01:17:15.239 --> 01:17:16.544
Matter of fact...

01:17:18.721 --> 01:17:20.201
You saying what I
think you're saying?

01:17:20.374 --> 01:17:22.899
I'm saying what you think
I'm saying, Preacher.

01:17:23.073 --> 01:17:23.900
So we gonna ball?

01:17:24.074 --> 01:17:26.163
So we gonna ball.

01:17:28.034 --> 01:17:29.394
That's what I'm
talkin' about, boo.

01:17:33.300 --> 01:17:36.347
Welcome! This is what we've
all been waiting for.

01:17:36.521 --> 01:17:38.349
The new be versus the old.

01:17:38.523 --> 01:17:41.569
The old be versus the new.
The good be versus the bad.

01:17:41.744 --> 01:17:44.834
Are they gonna be a no-show
like they did in 1968?

01:17:45.008 --> 01:17:46.792
But, no, they're not.

01:17:46.966 --> 01:17:49.577
Here they come! They're here!
Here they come, baby!

01:17:49.752 --> 01:17:51.754
Here they come! Aw, yeah!

01:17:51.928 --> 01:17:53.364
We got a game on our hands!

01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.342
Okay, Grandpa, you
gotta take your pills

01:18:15.516 --> 01:18:16.561
before you start, okay?

01:18:16.735 --> 01:18:18.084
Preacher, we gotta
take our pills.

01:18:18.258 --> 01:18:20.783
Not the blue ones. Save
those for tonight.

01:18:20.957 --> 01:18:22.567
It's all right.
What we gonna do?

01:18:22.741 --> 01:18:24.240
- We gonna get this win.
- We gonna get this win, right?

01:18:24.264 --> 01:18:25.704
Look, this one's for
Big Fella, okay?

01:18:25.788 --> 01:18:27.746
So, Big Fella on three.
One, two, three.

01:18:27.920 --> 01:18:29.269
Big Fella!

01:18:29.443 --> 01:18:31.141
Here we go, C-Dawg!
Let's do this, baby.

01:18:31.315 --> 01:18:33.273
You got this, Drew.
You the man, bruh.

01:18:33.447 --> 01:18:34.990
You put this team
together, remember that.

01:18:35.014 --> 01:18:36.624
Your roster, my team.

01:18:36.799 --> 01:18:39.236
That's right, your team.
Last week, I took your team.

01:18:39.410 --> 01:18:41.455
Yesterday, I took your girl.

01:18:41.629 --> 01:18:43.501
Today, I'm gonna
take your heart.

01:18:43.675 --> 01:18:44.937
Man, you've...

01:18:45.111 --> 01:18:46.286
Okay.

01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:48.549
- Stop it!
- Stop what?

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:51.044
- Folding your arms like me.
- Folding your arms like that.

01:18:53.293 --> 01:18:55.208
Let's get this win, baby.

01:18:55.382 --> 01:18:56.993
Good luck, youngblood.

01:18:57.167 --> 01:18:58.884
Oh, luck ain't got nothing
to do with it, Old Dusty.

01:18:58.908 --> 01:18:59.952
"Old Dusty"?

01:19:02.172 --> 01:19:04.043
Pastor Wrinkles,
what's the word, man?

01:19:04.217 --> 01:19:06.872
Young fella got jokes.

01:19:07.046 --> 01:19:08.446
- Shoe ain't tied.
- What shoe? Huh?

01:19:08.569 --> 01:19:10.441
- Lights!
- Championship time!

01:19:10.615 --> 01:19:12.071
Oh, that's the oldest
trick in the book!

01:19:12.095 --> 01:19:13.575
You gonna let him...
Oh, come on, now!

01:19:13.661 --> 01:19:15.968
Over to Uncle. Jumper.

01:19:16.142 --> 01:19:16.969
In and out.

01:19:17.143 --> 01:19:19.580
That's okay, guys!

01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:22.061
The bounce pass to Casper.
Casper, oh, my God!

01:19:22.235 --> 01:19:24.194
Oh, yeah, I need you to see me.

01:19:24.368 --> 01:19:26.259
Wipe your goggles, old fella.
I need you to see me.

01:19:26.283 --> 01:19:28.174
- You gotta see me all night.
- Man, move. Fool, please.

01:19:28.198 --> 01:19:29.852
- That's right, Casper!
- Come on, Drew!

01:19:30.026 --> 01:19:31.418
This is Uncle.

01:19:31.592 --> 01:19:33.159
Cross the mid-court line.
Betty...

01:19:34.204 --> 01:19:36.336
Lights out! No good!

01:19:36.510 --> 01:19:38.077
Oh, man!

01:19:38.251 --> 01:19:39.771
That's right, old
people are overrated!

01:19:43.213 --> 01:19:44.954
Over to Casper the
Friendly Ghost.

01:19:45.128 --> 01:19:46.235
Nothin' but the
bottom of the net.

01:19:46.259 --> 01:19:47.826
Wake up! Come on!

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:53.266
Up! Up! Up!

01:19:56.139 --> 01:19:57.793
- You gotta love it!
- Yes!

01:19:57.967 --> 01:19:59.167
Mario, comin' back down court,

01:19:59.316 --> 01:20:01.274
kickin' it over to Beazy!

01:20:01.448 --> 01:20:02.885
We makin' baskets!

01:20:03.059 --> 01:20:05.017
That's right, we
makin' buckets, baby.

01:20:05.191 --> 01:20:07.715
Uncle Drew the other way.
This is Betty!

01:20:07.890 --> 01:20:09.761
Betty Lou jumper no good.

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:11.855
They fightin' for it, baby!
They fightin' for it!

01:20:11.981 --> 01:20:14.505
Betty Lou wins it!
Get it, Betty Lou!

01:20:14.679 --> 01:20:16.159
There you go, Betty Lou.
There you go!

01:20:16.202 --> 01:20:17.813
You know that's really a man.

01:20:18.857 --> 01:20:20.250
I got Drew.

01:20:20.424 --> 01:20:22.078
Slow it down. Slow it down.

01:20:22.252 --> 01:20:25.385
They tired, yo. They tired.
The fatigue's settin' in.

01:20:25.559 --> 01:20:27.399
- Betty Lou. Switch it!
- Fatigue's settin' in.

01:20:27.474 --> 01:20:30.129
You can hear their
knee caps grinding.

01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:34.699
Uncle, Betty Lou.

01:20:35.178 --> 01:20:36.570
Downtown!

01:20:36.744 --> 01:20:38.311
You gonna let a
girl score on you?

01:20:38.485 --> 01:20:40.879
This is Casper the
Friendly Ghost.

01:20:41.053 --> 01:20:42.925
Oh, my God!

01:20:43.099 --> 01:20:45.275
Oh, that's right.
That's right, baby.

01:20:47.103 --> 01:20:48.582
- Oh!
- Oh...

01:20:51.934 --> 01:20:53.805
Turnaround, once again.

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:56.764
The friendly one. What a goal!
Oh, baby!

01:20:56.939 --> 01:20:58.810
Somebody get on
Casper, come on, man!

01:21:00.812 --> 01:21:02.292
Casper!

01:21:04.729 --> 01:21:06.339
Damn, man!

01:21:06.513 --> 01:21:07.873
Homecourt Advantage
is running away

01:21:08.037 --> 01:21:09.037
with the first half.

01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:34.628
My TV ain't working.

01:21:36.108 --> 01:21:37.544
Do I look like an electrician?

01:21:44.073 --> 01:21:45.073
I know, right?

01:21:45.204 --> 01:21:47.076
Oh, yeah, that was him. Brian.

01:21:50.731 --> 01:21:52.429
Y'all got a TV?

01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.697
Just judgin'. Me and her,

01:21:59.871 --> 01:22:01.264
we're talkin' about Rachel.

01:22:01.438 --> 01:22:03.005
Where you from?
What's your name?

01:22:03.179 --> 01:22:04.896
I'm Kathy from Staten Island.
How you doin'?

01:22:04.920 --> 01:22:05.940
Thank you. How you doin'?
Oh, wait. Come on.

01:22:05.964 --> 01:22:07.444
You're my victim.

01:22:07.618 --> 01:22:08.924
- I mean... I mean, my patient.-

01:22:14.146 --> 01:22:16.168
That's my team right there. I
used to play on that team.

01:22:16.192 --> 01:22:17.758
Okay, guys, bring it in.

01:22:18.629 --> 01:22:19.935
Let's turn this game around.

01:22:20.109 --> 01:22:22.154
So, on three, Big Fella.
One, two, three.

01:22:22.328 --> 01:22:24.243
- Big Fella!
- Let's go, guys.

01:22:24.417 --> 01:22:27.159
Harlem Buckets down by 16
at the start of the third.

01:22:27.333 --> 01:22:29.814
Here we go!

01:22:29.988 --> 01:22:34.036
Casper, the Friendly
Ghost from downtown!

01:22:34.210 --> 01:22:36.473
Get in front of your man.

01:22:36.647 --> 01:22:38.518
Boots with the ball.
Lookin' at it.

01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:41.739
Boots makin' his move.
To Lights from downtown.

01:22:41.913 --> 01:22:43.436
Not this time.

01:22:46.526 --> 01:22:48.659
Reynolds Wrap to Casper.

01:22:48.833 --> 01:22:51.183
Not today. Give me that.

01:22:51.357 --> 01:22:52.663
Please, not in my house.

01:22:52.837 --> 01:22:54.534
Come on, now. That's a foul!

01:22:54.708 --> 01:22:56.164
- That's what I'm talkin' about.
- You know that's a foul.

01:22:56.188 --> 01:22:57.644
Where I'm from, it's
no blood, no foul.

01:22:57.668 --> 01:22:59.308
- Where you from?
- I just came from Hell,

01:22:59.365 --> 01:23:00.821
whooping the Devil's ass,
that's where I'm from.

01:23:00.845 --> 01:23:01.909
- Break it up.
- That's not godly.

01:23:01.933 --> 01:23:03.456
They gangbangin' for Jesus.

01:23:03.630 --> 01:23:05.545
Back to live action! Here we go!

01:23:05.719 --> 01:23:07.721
Deflected! Goin' the other way!

01:23:07.895 --> 01:23:09.636
Good block. Come on,
y'all, let's get it.

01:23:09.810 --> 01:23:12.683
Uncle, look at him! Off the
backboard to Preacher!

01:23:14.206 --> 01:23:15.526
Damn, man! Get the
ball, let's go!

01:23:15.686 --> 01:23:16.948
My backboard, my house, sucker.

01:23:17.122 --> 01:23:18.471
That's what I'm talkin' about!

01:23:18.645 --> 01:23:19.864
Put it home, Preach!

01:23:20.038 --> 01:23:21.648
That what I'm talking about!

01:23:21.822 --> 01:23:23.781
This is Casper with it.
Kicks it over to Mario.

01:23:23.955 --> 01:23:25.478
Jump shot. No good!

01:23:25.652 --> 01:23:29.265
Yes! That's right,
y'all, we got this.

01:23:29.439 --> 01:23:33.225
He kicks it over, right
side to Betty Lou!

01:23:34.052 --> 01:23:35.052
Oh, my!

01:23:36.489 --> 01:23:37.534
- Oh, my!
- Yeah!

01:23:37.708 --> 01:23:38.926
Yes!

01:23:39.101 --> 01:23:40.624
Uncle to the rescue!

01:23:40.798 --> 01:23:42.452
Get on that old man!

01:23:42.626 --> 01:23:44.889
Harlem Buckets are
trying to come back.

01:23:45.063 --> 01:23:47.109
This is Casper with it.
Casper, looking at it.

01:23:49.154 --> 01:23:50.154
Come on, now!

01:23:51.461 --> 01:23:52.723
I got this.

01:23:52.897 --> 01:23:54.290
B-B-B-B-B-B-Boots with it.

01:23:54.464 --> 01:23:55.615
Booty through the
defender's legs.

01:23:55.639 --> 01:23:57.423
Look at Boots.

01:23:58.685 --> 01:24:00.252
Yes! Way to finish, man.

01:24:00.426 --> 01:24:01.819
I can't believe it.

01:24:01.993 --> 01:24:03.342
They're trying to
make a comeback.

01:24:03.516 --> 01:24:06.867
Reynolds Wrap to Casper. For 30!

01:24:07.564 --> 01:24:08.913
It's shut down time.

01:24:10.654 --> 01:24:12.177
Now shoot, Betty Lou. Get 'em.

01:24:12.351 --> 01:24:15.702
Over to Betty Lou! Good!

01:24:17.052 --> 01:24:18.444
Get your head out your ass.

01:24:18.618 --> 01:24:20.316
I knew I married you
for a reason, girl.

01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:22.883
Game recognize game, big daddy.

01:24:23.058 --> 01:24:25.495
Here we go. This is Uncle
Drew with the ball.

01:24:25.669 --> 01:24:28.541
It's him and you, you and him.
What you gonna do?

01:24:28.715 --> 01:24:29.715
What you gonna do?

01:24:31.109 --> 01:24:33.720
Drew steps back.
Left-handed jumper...

01:24:33.894 --> 01:24:35.418
What'd I tell you?
What'd I tell you?

01:24:35.592 --> 01:24:37.159
Harlem Buckets, baby.

01:24:37.333 --> 01:24:38.812
Kicks it out over.

01:24:38.986 --> 01:24:41.032
Oh, I got this. My board, my board.
Let's go.

01:24:41.206 --> 01:24:42.599
Are you kidding me?

01:24:42.773 --> 01:24:46.472
Here he go. Light the light.

01:24:47.038 --> 01:24:48.692
- Bang!
- Lights out, baby.

01:24:48.866 --> 01:24:50.106
That makes it a two point lead.

01:24:50.998 --> 01:24:53.088
Here we go! The fast break!

01:24:53.262 --> 01:24:54.350
There we go, there we go!

01:24:54.524 --> 01:24:56.439
- Whoa.
- I got ya now!

01:24:56.613 --> 01:24:58.223
That's what I'm talking
about, Lights!

01:24:58.397 --> 01:25:00.375
- Get that outta here!
- That's a foul! Come on now!

01:25:00.399 --> 01:25:01.748
- Lights?
- You see that defense?

01:25:01.922 --> 01:25:04.099
You all right, Lights?
Get up, man. Get up.

01:25:04.273 --> 01:25:07.406
Lights. Lights,
where does it hurt?

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:10.061
- Ankle.
- Okay, okay. Sit up.

01:25:10.235 --> 01:25:11.628
Yo, that's bush league, Winslow.

01:25:11.802 --> 01:25:12.977
You took out my player.

01:25:13.151 --> 01:25:14.674
Man, what are you talking about?

01:25:14.848 --> 01:25:16.937
Your boy, James Unworthy,
just knocked my boy out.

01:25:17.112 --> 01:25:20.767
Cheatin'-ass cheaters. Y'all
need to cheat to cheat.

01:25:20.941 --> 01:25:22.702
It's gonna be all right,
it's gonna be all right.

01:25:22.726 --> 01:25:24.902
I'm getting too old for this.

01:25:25.076 --> 01:25:26.251
What are we gonna do, bruh?

01:25:26.425 --> 01:25:28.035
Lights is out. What we gonna do?

01:25:28.210 --> 01:25:29.970
- What you mean?
- What you mean, "What I mean"?

01:25:29.994 --> 01:25:31.256
We have no more players left.

01:25:31.430 --> 01:25:32.823
It's your moment, ain't it?

01:25:32.997 --> 01:25:35.217
No. I've already told
you a million times.

01:25:35.391 --> 01:25:36.870
I'm not playing, okay?

01:25:37.044 --> 01:25:38.872
Plus, I ain't played
in decades, bruh.

01:25:39.046 --> 01:25:40.439
And they have?

01:25:40.613 --> 01:25:42.006
Drew, it's different, okay?

01:25:42.180 --> 01:25:43.964
They were actually
good when they played.

01:25:44.878 --> 01:25:46.228
Listen to me, youngblood.

01:25:46.402 --> 01:25:48.708
You think you're the only one

01:25:48.882 --> 01:25:50.928
that made that mistake
that defined their life.

01:25:52.016 --> 01:25:53.800
I've been on the
road my whole life.

01:25:53.974 --> 01:25:55.541
I got no real friends.

01:25:55.715 --> 01:25:58.370
I'm bouncin' city to city.
And you wanna know why?

01:25:58.544 --> 01:26:00.894
Because I got too much
pride to say I'm sorry.

01:26:01.068 --> 01:26:02.418
You know how that sounds?

01:26:02.592 --> 01:26:04.004
Have too much pride
to say you're sorry

01:26:04.028 --> 01:26:05.769
to the people that love you?

01:26:05.943 --> 01:26:07.597
Don't you dare be like
that, youngblood.

01:26:07.771 --> 01:26:09.076
You be better than that.

01:26:10.339 --> 01:26:11.514
This is the moment.

01:26:11.688 --> 01:26:13.124
You gonna run away from it,

01:26:13.298 --> 01:26:15.257
or you gonna step
up and take it?

01:26:15.431 --> 01:26:16.823
Choice is yours.

01:26:18.912 --> 01:26:21.350
That's right, bruh.
Championships.

01:26:21.524 --> 01:26:23.221
This is destiny now.

01:26:28.313 --> 01:26:29.793
I'll play under one condition.

01:26:29.967 --> 01:26:31.534
And what's that?

01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:35.233
Let me guard the white boy.

01:26:36.103 --> 01:26:37.844
Let's roll!

01:26:38.018 --> 01:26:40.151
It's a minute and nine
second left, folks.

01:26:40.325 --> 01:26:43.763
Excuse me. Timeout, timeout.

01:26:43.937 --> 01:26:46.070
- Timeout, timeout!
- Who are you?

01:26:46.244 --> 01:26:47.767
I'm the assistant coach.

01:26:47.941 --> 01:26:49.919
I'm here to make sure that
he's tall enough to ride

01:26:49.943 --> 01:26:53.077
the ride that my man
about to put him on.

01:26:53.251 --> 01:26:54.644
What are you doing, man?

01:26:54.818 --> 01:26:55.925
This should be a technical
foul or something.

01:26:55.949 --> 01:26:57.124
I'mma kick you off this court

01:26:57.299 --> 01:26:58.648
like I kicked you out my house.

01:26:58.822 --> 01:27:00.432
- That's right.
- That's mean, okay?

01:27:00.606 --> 01:27:01.955
Excuse me? I don't know

01:27:02.129 --> 01:27:03.609
who you are or what
this is about,

01:27:03.783 --> 01:27:05.239
but could you please take
it back to the stands

01:27:05.263 --> 01:27:06.903
- so we can play some ball?
- Who are you?

01:27:07.047 --> 01:27:08.503
If you keep talking,
you're gonna find out.

01:27:08.527 --> 01:27:09.920
Oh, you about to
find out, honey.

01:27:10.094 --> 01:27:12.139
I come from a long
line of choir members.

01:27:12.314 --> 01:27:13.619
So, we gonna clap back!

01:27:13.793 --> 01:27:15.447
- Yeah, that's right.
- I bet you do.

01:27:15.621 --> 01:27:17.541
Just clap you up out of here.
Don't play with me.

01:27:17.710 --> 01:27:18.774
- I will not!
- I love you, baby.

01:27:18.798 --> 01:27:20.104
I love you, too.

01:27:20.278 --> 01:27:22.237
We believe in you guys.
Be aggressive.

01:27:22.411 --> 01:27:23.771
- All right.
- What am I doing now?

01:27:23.847 --> 01:27:25.172
Brought your girl,
playin' mind games.

01:27:25.196 --> 01:27:26.304
Ain't nobody scared of you, man.

01:27:26.328 --> 01:27:28.068
Oh, ain't nobody scared of me?

01:27:28.243 --> 01:27:30.323
- Let's do this, man.
- What's Dax doing in the game?

01:27:31.289 --> 01:27:33.248
I got your back.
I got your back.

01:27:33.422 --> 01:27:34.249
- Trail, Dax, trail.
- All right.

01:27:34.423 --> 01:27:35.250
Yo help Uncle Drew.

01:27:35.424 --> 01:27:37.600
No, move. Come on.

01:27:37.774 --> 01:27:39.360
It's him and you, baby.
What you gonna do?

01:27:39.384 --> 01:27:42.692
Let's go, baby. Let's ball, baby.
Vanilla Sky!

01:27:43.823 --> 01:27:45.651
Oh, it's a four point lead now.

01:27:45.825 --> 01:27:47.265
Come on, youngblood.
That's too easy.

01:27:47.436 --> 01:27:49.220
Look, it won't happen
next time, okay?

01:27:49.394 --> 01:27:52.310
Uncle gently across
the mid-court line,

01:27:52.484 --> 01:27:53.920
with seconds left.

01:27:54.094 --> 01:27:56.009
He's gotta foul whoever
may be guardin' him.

01:27:56.183 --> 01:27:57.707
Uncle to Preacher.

01:27:57.881 --> 01:28:00.840
It's the Preacher, man.
Oh, baby, hallelujah!

01:28:01.014 --> 01:28:02.886
Praise the Lord, Preacher,
praise the Lord.

01:28:03.060 --> 01:28:04.888
Here we go now.

01:28:05.062 --> 01:28:07.064
Harlem Money in desperate
need of a turnover.

01:28:07.238 --> 01:28:10.981
If not, Homecourt Advantage
can walk away and win it all.

01:28:11.155 --> 01:28:13.113
Here we go.

01:28:13.288 --> 01:28:14.985
What that white boy
doing with that ball?

01:28:15.159 --> 01:28:16.223
Oh, he's doing his shaky-shake.

01:28:16.247 --> 01:28:17.379
That's right.

01:28:19.468 --> 01:28:20.860
Good steal, Dax, good steal.

01:28:21.034 --> 01:28:22.034
Go on, Dax, shoot it!

01:28:22.122 --> 01:28:23.167
Let it fly, Dax!

01:28:23.341 --> 01:28:25.038
Shoot it, shoot it! Put it up.

01:28:25.212 --> 01:28:27.092
- Come on, Dax! Shoot it!
- Take that shot, bro!

01:28:27.171 --> 01:28:28.171
Shoot it!

01:28:28.303 --> 01:28:29.391
Timeout.

01:28:29.565 --> 01:28:30.765
Timeout? You gonna make me have

01:28:30.870 --> 01:28:32.350
another heart attack, boy.

01:28:32.524 --> 01:28:34.570
Hey, he fouled me on that.

01:28:34.744 --> 01:28:35.527
You're saying he didn't foul me?

01:28:35.701 --> 01:28:37.094
That was a reach, ref.

01:28:39.662 --> 01:28:41.141
Let's go.

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.187
Okay, relax. Listen, I got this.

01:28:43.361 --> 01:28:45.711
Drew, they can't guard you, man.

01:28:45.885 --> 01:28:47.123
All we need you to do is just
penetrate to the bucket,

01:28:47.147 --> 01:28:48.366
do what you've been doing,

01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:50.020
the defense will
collapse on you.

01:28:50.194 --> 01:28:51.693
Once they do that, you
kick it out to Betty Lou.

01:28:51.717 --> 01:28:53.328
Betty Lou will take the three.
That's it.

01:28:53.502 --> 01:28:55.547
Game over. Game plan. That's it.

01:29:00.073 --> 01:29:02.772
What? Seriously, what's
wrong with that play?

01:29:02.946 --> 01:29:04.164
You'll make it.

01:29:04.339 --> 01:29:05.775
Excuse me?

01:29:05.949 --> 01:29:07.669
Drew's right. They're
not even guarding you.

01:29:07.820 --> 01:29:09.300
It's a reason for that, Lights.

01:29:09.474 --> 01:29:11.346
Leave the past in
the past, move on.

01:29:12.085 --> 01:29:13.783
You got this, Dax.

01:29:13.957 --> 01:29:15.698
We don't need you to
be great all the time.

01:29:15.872 --> 01:29:17.874
We need you to be
great this one time.

01:29:19.658 --> 01:29:22.357
Can you do that?
We believe in you.

01:29:23.227 --> 01:29:24.315
What if I miss?

01:29:24.489 --> 01:29:25.751
What if you don't?

01:29:25.925 --> 01:29:26.925
You got this.

01:29:29.755 --> 01:29:31.801
Come on now.

01:29:31.975 --> 01:29:33.498
Let's go. Let's bring it in.

01:29:33.672 --> 01:29:34.804
We in this together.

01:29:38.721 --> 01:29:41.637
You got this. Buckets on three.
One, two, three.

01:29:41.811 --> 01:29:43.073
Buckets!

01:29:43.247 --> 01:29:44.988
Preach, Preach, Preach.

01:29:45.162 --> 01:29:48.295
In case something happens, we
got no more timeouts, okay?

01:29:48.470 --> 01:29:49.775
You sure?

01:29:49.949 --> 01:29:51.908
Yeah, I'm sure. We
used our last one.

01:29:52.082 --> 01:29:54.476
I could have swore
we had one more.

01:29:54.650 --> 01:29:57.043
This is it. This is for
the money in the bank.

01:29:57.217 --> 01:29:58.741
This is for all the marbles.

01:29:58.915 --> 01:30:00.525
Come on, come on, Dax.

01:30:00.699 --> 01:30:03.136
Buckets, down by two,
a three can win.

01:30:03.310 --> 01:30:05.661
Eight seconds left
in the ball game.

01:30:05.835 --> 01:30:08.315
This is Uncle with it.
Uncle, looking at it.

01:30:09.142 --> 01:30:11.275
Uncle over to Hobbit.

01:30:40.739 --> 01:30:43.829
Yes, we won the Rucker, baby!
We won the Rucker.

01:30:44.003 --> 01:30:45.570
That's what I'm
talkin' about, baby!

01:30:45.744 --> 01:30:47.398
We did this, man! We did that!

01:30:47.572 --> 01:30:48.572
You the man!

01:30:49.356 --> 01:30:51.446
Mookie! Hey, Mookie!

01:30:55.145 --> 01:30:55.972
Good game, man.

01:30:56.146 --> 01:30:57.147
Good game, bro.

01:30:59.062 --> 01:31:02.021
I see what you're doing now.
Playing mind games with me.

01:31:02.195 --> 01:31:06.330
Okay. I'll see you next year, bruh.
The cycle continues.

01:31:08.637 --> 01:31:10.247
Fellas, we did that, y'all.

01:31:10.421 --> 01:31:11.421
Pick him up!

01:31:11.553 --> 01:31:12.902
Pick me up? Hey! No, no, no.

01:31:13.076 --> 01:31:14.164
He's way too heavy, boy.

01:31:14.338 --> 01:31:15.557
His head too big.

01:31:15.731 --> 01:31:17.080
Head weigh about a
hundred pounds.

01:31:19.517 --> 01:31:20.736
I'll be back, y'all.

01:31:23.042 --> 01:31:24.043
Hey.

01:31:24.479 --> 01:31:25.480
Hey.

01:31:31.442 --> 01:31:33.444
Oh. This is nice.

01:31:47.153 --> 01:31:49.068
- I'll be back.
- Okay.

01:31:50.330 --> 01:31:51.549
There ya go. That's what

01:31:51.723 --> 01:31:53.203
I'm talking about, young fella.

01:31:56.249 --> 01:31:58.513
The hero, Dax.

01:31:59.905 --> 01:32:03.996
Man, I'm damn proud of you.

01:32:06.216 --> 01:32:07.739
You took that last shot.

01:32:09.524 --> 01:32:11.830
You miss a hundred percent
of the shots you don't take.

01:32:13.658 --> 01:32:15.355
Game ball goes to you.

01:32:17.488 --> 01:32:20.665
Your team. Your roster.

01:32:25.627 --> 01:32:28.412
Nah. My family.

01:32:42.774 --> 01:32:46.038
Big Fella, man, I'm really
happy that you're okay, man.

01:32:51.609 --> 01:32:52.610
And if anything...

01:32:55.482 --> 01:32:58.007
We were all really...

01:33:00.618 --> 01:33:03.360
Okay, look, I paid the bill.

01:33:03.969 --> 01:33:05.231
Thanks.

01:33:05.405 --> 01:33:06.972
I had to pay the bill.
You know why?

01:33:07.146 --> 01:33:08.210
That's what you do for family.

01:33:08.234 --> 01:33:10.193
Shh! You still talking?

01:33:10.367 --> 01:33:12.630
Hey, check it out,
we're on SportsCenter.

01:33:12.804 --> 01:33:14.414
Everyone was clowning
him, including us.

01:33:14.589 --> 01:33:16.068
Well, you're number one tonight

01:33:16.242 --> 01:33:18.288
in the right top ten
for this right here.

01:33:18.462 --> 01:33:20.943
Dax Winslow, all three of these,

01:33:21.117 --> 01:33:24.599
and the Harlem Buckets
win the Rucker 50.

01:33:24.773 --> 01:33:27.166
I'm still baffled by a
lot of this guy's story.

01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:31.475
I don't understand a lot,
frankly, but I know this much.

01:33:31.649 --> 01:33:33.608
He went from a
punchline to a hero,

01:33:33.782 --> 01:33:35.222
getting carried off
on his teammates'

01:33:35.305 --> 01:33:36.915
shoulders in Rucker.

01:33:37.089 --> 01:33:38.613
Way to go, Dax.

01:33:45.141 --> 01:33:46.838
Yo, yo, yo,

01:33:47.012 --> 01:33:48.424
here's the coach of the year.
Dax is here, baby.

01:33:48.448 --> 01:33:49.798
I be the Rucker champ.

01:33:49.972 --> 01:33:51.277
Just leave a message, you know,

01:33:51.451 --> 01:33:52.531
when I give you the chance.

01:33:52.583 --> 01:33:54.367
Hey, Dax, it's, uh, me, Jess.

01:33:54.541 --> 01:33:56.221
When you get a chance,
give me a call back.

01:33:56.369 --> 01:33:58.502
Hey, Dax, it's me again.

01:33:58.676 --> 01:33:59.851
Your phone must be dead,

01:34:00.025 --> 01:34:01.461
'cause it went right
to voicemail.

01:34:01.636 --> 01:34:03.004
Do you remember when I
made that investment

01:34:03.028 --> 01:34:04.428
in them shoes? Do
you remember that?

01:34:04.551 --> 01:34:06.379
You remember that? Do
you remember that?

01:34:06.553 --> 01:34:08.381
Do you remember that?
Do you remember that?

01:34:08.555 --> 01:34:10.340
I wanted to let you
know that I went ahead

01:34:10.514 --> 01:34:12.211
and kicked Mook to the curb.

01:34:12.385 --> 01:34:15.737
Uh, I noticed the phone went
straight to voicemail again.

01:34:15.911 --> 01:34:20.219
Do you remember that? Hey.
Dax, do you remember that?

01:34:20.393 --> 01:34:22.613
I am affiliated with
several gangsters.

01:34:22.787 --> 01:34:23.962
I will find out where you at.

01:34:24.136 --> 01:34:25.790
We gonna come over
to your house.

01:34:25.964 --> 01:34:29.402
I let you stay in my house
rent-free for all that time.

01:34:29.576 --> 01:34:31.100
I hate you, Dax.

01:34:31.274 --> 01:34:32.884
But I love you so much.

01:34:33.058 --> 01:34:35.365
I don't know why you're
doing me like this.

01:34:36.758 --> 01:34:38.237
- You know what?
- You, Dax!

01:34:41.110 --> 01:34:42.790
Gotta make sure I get
the behind the scene,

01:34:42.894 --> 01:34:44.069
behind the scene.

01:34:45.767 --> 01:34:48.073
Yeah.

01:34:48.247 --> 01:34:49.572
I appreciate you guys
following me to makeup.

01:34:49.596 --> 01:34:51.163
But now, you gots to go.

01:34:59.215 --> 01:35:00.216
Wow!

01:35:10.356 --> 01:35:11.516
Kyrie's under here somewhere.

01:35:15.144 --> 01:35:17.189
Uh-huh. No.

01:35:19.844 --> 01:35:22.412
Hey, girl. Lights
just called me.

01:35:22.586 --> 01:35:25.197
Preacher, you put your Bible
in the club and can't find it?

01:35:28.723 --> 01:35:31.421
Hold up. Wait a minute. Hold on.

01:35:31.595 --> 01:35:33.162
I can't play in that tourney

01:35:33.336 --> 01:35:35.183
and let that little white
boy block my shot again.

01:35:35.207 --> 01:35:36.794
Give me a pudding even though
it's gonna give me diarrhea.

01:35:36.818 --> 01:35:37.969
Hey, I don't mean
to grab your face.

01:35:37.993 --> 01:35:39.429
I'm sorry.

01:35:39.603 --> 01:35:41.736
Hold up, hold up. Run
it back, run it back.

01:35:41.910 --> 01:35:43.520
Don't you wanna go with a coach

01:35:43.694 --> 01:35:45.130
who straight up looks like Urkel

01:35:45.304 --> 01:35:47.437
got put in a trash compactor?

01:35:47.611 --> 01:35:50.048
Isn't that what you want?

01:35:50.222 --> 01:35:52.790
Wait a minute. Run that back.
Just run it back.

01:35:52.964 --> 01:35:54.139
Don't you wanna be coached

01:35:54.313 --> 01:35:55.593
by a dude who looks like an M&M?

01:35:57.186 --> 01:35:58.448
Double or nothin' this time.

01:35:58.622 --> 01:36:00.624
Double or nothin',
double or nothin'.

01:36:00.798 --> 01:36:02.017
Hey, man, you don't

01:36:02.191 --> 01:36:03.409
blow no whistle in my gym.

01:36:08.980 --> 01:36:10.721
Okay, that's... Okay... Stop!

01:36:10.895 --> 01:36:13.158
Or little hobbit here
could take his spot.

01:36:13.332 --> 01:36:14.943
Who you callin' a
hobbit, Uncle Ben?

01:36:15.117 --> 01:36:16.596
Uncle Ben?

01:36:16.771 --> 01:36:18.331
You heard what I said.
Get me some rice.

01:36:18.424 --> 01:36:20.818
No, no, no...

01:36:20.992 --> 01:36:23.865
Youngblood, I can't take this
rappity-hippity-hop nonsense.

01:36:24.039 --> 01:36:25.301
You say "hippity-hoppity."

01:36:25.475 --> 01:36:26.258
That's something
rabbits would make.

01:36:26.432 --> 01:36:27.651
If rabbits made music,

01:36:27.825 --> 01:36:29.479
it would be called
hippity-hoppity.

01:36:29.653 --> 01:36:31.655
You know how old this van is?
Older than you.

01:36:31.829 --> 01:36:33.048
I assume it is, brother.

01:36:33.222 --> 01:36:35.485
Lots gone down in here.

01:36:35.659 --> 01:36:37.400
Somethin' went down here,
stained that seat.

01:36:38.227 --> 01:36:40.664
Feel good about that.

01:36:40.838 --> 01:36:44.624
Got a microwave in here,
you got carpet everywhere.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:46.039
Ain't no tellin' what old women

01:36:46.191 --> 01:36:47.453
you'd have back there.

01:36:47.627 --> 01:36:48.866
Probably had your
momma back there.

01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:50.108
- You ever say...
- Ooh!

01:36:50.282 --> 01:36:51.762
I'm an orphan, for
your information.

01:36:51.936 --> 01:36:53.459
So I don't know who my momma is.

01:36:55.244 --> 01:36:58.073
This is what we call a ditty now.
Ooh.

01:36:58.247 --> 01:37:02.947
My lady... That ditty just crazy.
Mmm!

01:37:03.121 --> 01:37:04.644
I got it. This is
the real version.

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:06.951
We not goin' be disrespecting
a classic like that.

01:37:07.125 --> 01:37:08.365
That came out before you was...

01:37:08.474 --> 01:37:10.085
- You have to drive.
- Oh, I forgot.

01:37:14.002 --> 01:37:17.483
Get out of here. Go!

01:37:17.657 --> 01:37:20.269
Courses. I've come a
long way since Kazaam.

01:37:21.357 --> 01:37:22.706
That is sick!

01:37:34.544 --> 01:37:35.744
I found him in a grocery store

01:37:35.893 --> 01:37:37.173
putting cans on the top shelves.

01:37:37.286 --> 01:37:38.940
That's all he's good for.

01:37:40.332 --> 01:37:41.464
I'm sorry.

01:37:45.511 --> 01:37:47.557
You are my Beyonce, okay?

01:37:47.731 --> 01:37:51.039
Not Dantay, not White
Dantay, not Jeff,

01:37:51.213 --> 01:37:54.129
and not the dude who look like
he sang with New Addition.

01:37:54.303 --> 01:37:55.434
I'm so sorry.

01:37:55.608 --> 01:37:56.783
I'm so sorry.

01:38:10.188 --> 01:38:12.364
Rapid fire. I gotta
go rapid fire.

01:38:36.084 --> 01:38:37.912
Here we go. Watch
this right here.

01:38:38.086 --> 01:38:39.217
Ow! Ow!

01:38:42.612 --> 01:38:43.787
What is this, man?

01:38:43.961 --> 01:38:46.224
That look like a dead inch worm.

01:38:48.531 --> 01:38:49.971
Who you trying to be?
Morgan Freeman?

01:38:53.275 --> 01:38:55.755
You played a heck of
a game today, sir.

01:38:55.930 --> 01:38:57.279
Appreciate you
saying that, Coach.

01:38:57.453 --> 01:38:59.498
You ever think about
re-taking those SATs?

01:38:59.672 --> 01:39:02.327
You have four years left
of eligibility, right?

01:39:02.501 --> 01:39:04.181
I'm more of a Blue Devil
man myself, Coach.

01:39:06.766 --> 01:39:07.942
Come on, Dax!

01:39:10.118 --> 01:39:12.381
Oh, too late, Drew. Too late.

01:39:12.555 --> 01:39:14.339
Your old-ass legs broke
up on you, Drew.
