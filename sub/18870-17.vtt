00:01.067 --> 00:02.502
<i>Previously, on "Being Mary Jane..."</i>

00:02.802 --> 00:05.372
<i>How many zeroes do we think
Mary Jane's producer-bae has?</i>

00:05.438 --> 00:08.074
But Miss Mary Jane Paul
is definitely not dating down.

00:08.375 --> 00:11.077
Is it really so bad that people know
that you have 30 million dollars?

00:11.511 --> 00:13.346
How did you know
it was 30 million dollars?

00:13.646 --> 00:14.848
This is wrong.

00:15.882 --> 00:18.017
Hashtag JustinKissedALotOfFrogs?

00:18.084 --> 00:20.286
- What's this?
- His ex-girlfriend, apparently.

00:20.353 --> 00:22.288
- This is Simone?
- Please, don't go.

00:22.555 --> 00:24.758
I'm not going anywhere. This is for you.

00:25.091 --> 00:26.426
I'm going to Paris. Tonight.

00:26.493 --> 00:28.795
Garrett's sending you
to cover the hacking story?

00:28.862 --> 00:29.796
I asked to go.

00:37.470 --> 00:40.073
You know, for your first warehouse party
in Bushwick,

00:40.373 --> 00:41.941
you didn't embarrass me too much.

00:42.242 --> 00:44.411
Girl, I still party like it's 1999.

00:45.044 --> 00:47.580
You sure do,
with that Will Smith reference.

00:48.281 --> 00:51.117
It's actually a Prince reference.
Damn millennials.

00:54.954 --> 00:56.890
Justin's flowers are still looking good.

00:58.291 --> 00:59.459
Flowers you sent.

01:00.326 --> 01:02.662
You have to keep the romance alive somehow.

01:02.729 --> 01:07.734
Well, unfortunately, it's not detracted
from hashtag JustinKissedALotOfFrogs.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.638
How's Justin taking it?

01:11.704 --> 01:14.374
It has been radio silence
since he got to Paris.

01:15.108 --> 01:18.912
I'm just afraid that I'm making
matters worse, especially for his ex.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.748
What if they find her?
What if she's reading these?

01:22.482 --> 01:24.117
You know what? Let me... Let me...

01:25.084 --> 01:26.286
What are you doing?

01:26.352 --> 01:29.889
Apologizing, and telling him to warn her.

01:31.658 --> 01:33.560
He says she has no digital footprint.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.929
Who was he dating? Dave Chappelle?

01:36.896 --> 01:38.331
Tell me you didn't text him that.

01:46.306 --> 01:47.507
What's he saying?

01:52.512 --> 01:53.546
He sent me a link.

01:57.550 --> 01:58.551
What?

01:58.618 --> 02:03.056
"Simone Norton, 32, succumbed
to her battle with cancer in 2010".

02:03.122 --> 02:06.593
Justin's ex who's getting dragged
on social media is dead?

02:07.861 --> 02:08.828
My God.

02:13.800 --> 02:15.468
It's that bitch from the Dugout Club,

02:15.535 --> 02:18.471
the one that winks at him when he goes up
to the deck, he's with her.

02:18.538 --> 02:19.606
- Sexy Sasha?
- Yes.

02:19.672 --> 02:21.307
- No. Carmelo's hittin' that.
- No?

02:21.641 --> 02:23.243
- Yeah? Then which hoe is it?
- Yes.

02:23.309 --> 02:26.412
I know he's with one of those hoes.
So which one is it? Which one is it?

02:27.547 --> 02:29.449
He'd tell me if he was cheating.

02:29.516 --> 02:31.851
I'd know.
He wouldn't be dodging me like this.

02:31.918 --> 02:33.520
- That's not an answer.
- Right?

02:33.586 --> 02:34.954
You need to leave right now

02:35.021 --> 02:36.923
and don't come back here
until you find him!

02:43.863 --> 02:45.031
You can come out now.

02:47.166 --> 02:49.502
I deserve an Oscar for that performance.

02:49.802 --> 02:51.437
Gosh, thanks. I owe you big time.

02:52.539 --> 02:55.308
Why on earth didn't you just tell him
that you were busy tonight

02:55.375 --> 02:57.343
prepping for your GDU interview?

02:57.710 --> 02:59.178
My boys don't care about that.

02:59.679 --> 03:02.015
They only care
about me playing out on that field.

03:02.549 --> 03:04.951
So what? You're gonna play forever
to appease them?

03:05.018 --> 03:07.186
Of course not.
I'm gonna get out while I'm on top.

03:07.253 --> 03:09.522
Yeah, now with all these eyes on you,

03:09.589 --> 03:12.258
and you and your teammates
taking a stand on immigration.

03:12.325 --> 03:14.894
- It's the perfect time to pivot. I know.
- Yes.

03:17.330 --> 03:19.799
You said that Gumbel's producers
asked about me, right?

03:20.166 --> 03:21.267
They sure did.

03:21.534 --> 03:23.503
You think you can get them
to watch my segment?

03:24.337 --> 03:25.705
Sure. Are you ready for that?

03:26.005 --> 03:28.775
- It'd be huge, right?
- I think you'd be the next Gumbel,

03:28.841 --> 03:30.577
- for crying out loud.
- Talk to them.

03:30.944 --> 03:32.412
Invite them over to "GDU".

03:33.446 --> 03:34.547
I'll talk to Marco.

03:35.848 --> 03:38.251
Good, because I'm tired
of lying for your ass.

03:38.685 --> 03:41.154
You wanted this, papi, okay?
So this is on you.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.462
Kara, I found out
how Justin got his money.

03:50.697 --> 03:52.031
The plot thickens.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.166
His ex-girlfriend.

03:55.034 --> 03:56.402
- She died?
- Yeah.

03:56.970 --> 03:58.271
She left him stock options

03:58.338 --> 04:01.541
at a multibillion-dollar tech start-up
that she founded.

04:02.141 --> 04:04.143
She's a genius and, apparently, a saint.

04:04.644 --> 04:06.846
It says she was
on the board of several charities

04:06.913 --> 04:08.014
and volunteered a lot.

04:08.781 --> 04:09.816
Okay.

04:10.717 --> 04:12.652
She had standing room only
at her funeral,

04:13.319 --> 04:14.754
in a church that seats thousands.

04:15.021 --> 04:18.024
We have a show to do. We don't have time
to compare you to a dead woman.

04:27.367 --> 04:29.869
Whose idea was it
to do this racist segment, again?

04:38.144 --> 04:39.646
That was fantastic!

04:39.712 --> 04:43.182
You can catch Mario and his mariachi band
on "Dancing Around the World."

04:43.249 --> 04:47.053
Season 12 premieres
next Tuesday at 10 p.m. on CTS.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.855
It's a shame Justin's gonna miss this.

04:48.921 --> 04:50.256
You'll watch it without him?

04:50.323 --> 04:52.792
I have to, otherwise,
you're gonna ruin it for me.

04:54.527 --> 04:58.431
He's doing such important work in Paris.
That hacking story will not go away.

04:58.965 --> 05:02.435
I'll speak with the reporter that broke
that story via satellite later on.

05:02.935 --> 05:06.339
But, first, we're gonna talk
to Hollywood A-lister Jessie Lords

05:06.406 --> 05:09.942
about her tips for raising kids
in the age of entitlement.

05:10.009 --> 05:12.211
All that, and more, on "Great Day USA."

05:12.545 --> 05:13.613
Mary Jane.

05:13.680 --> 05:16.182
Your story about voter suppression,
we've gotta cut it.

05:16.749 --> 05:17.717
The...

05:18.951 --> 05:20.620
The dance segment went on too long.

05:20.887 --> 05:26.292
Okay, great. We'll dance a two-step
while basic human rights are violated.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.028
But the Jessie Lords interview,
that's still a go.

05:29.529 --> 05:30.563
Fantastic.

05:30.630 --> 05:34.434
And great job working
in the Justin banter. Keep that up.

05:34.767 --> 05:37.203
Yeah... Garrett, about that,

05:37.970 --> 05:40.673
I don't know if I wanna keep... doing it.

05:40.973 --> 05:43.076
Don't you think
it's kind of old news by now?

05:43.142 --> 05:45.578
You can't stop the train
once it's been picking up steam.

05:46.112 --> 05:48.781
Garrett, if I keep talking
about my relationship on air,

05:49.282 --> 05:51.751
I'm not gonna have a relationship.
You know what I mean?

05:51.818 --> 05:54.587
Look, we haven't seen
numbers like this since...

05:54.654 --> 05:56.489
Yeah, since Ronda's departure, right?

05:56.789 --> 06:00.426
Yeah. So we've gotta milk this cow
until the thing runs dry, got it?

06:01.360 --> 06:02.328
Got it.

06:05.331 --> 06:07.266
I'm sure you must have had
some kind of help.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.902
If I had a ghostwriter,
it wouldn't have taken me two years

06:09.969 --> 06:10.970
to write the damn thing.

06:11.237 --> 06:14.006
I can't imagine how you managed
with your crazy schedule.

06:14.640 --> 06:16.609
Jessie, hi. Mary Jane Paul.

06:18.077 --> 06:19.145
Mary Jane.

06:20.012 --> 06:21.013
Nice to meet you.

06:21.748 --> 06:24.951
I've gotta say, I devoured
your book in record time.

06:25.017 --> 06:26.185
You don't have to do that.

06:28.287 --> 06:31.858
Pretend to be genuinely interested.
It's... It's okay.

06:32.792 --> 06:35.528
No, when I do an interview,
I do the research.

06:35.595 --> 06:37.964
I mean, I read cover to cover.

06:38.231 --> 06:39.866
An advice guide for parents?

06:39.932 --> 06:40.900
Yeah.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.804
Did you tweet about it or...?

06:45.838 --> 06:49.175
I'm sorry, it's just that I noticed
that you are always out there on Twitter,

06:49.575 --> 06:53.913
and it's one of the things
I warn parents against.

06:54.547 --> 06:57.016
Some of us use social media for our jobs.

06:57.750 --> 07:00.920
But I did appreciate you promoting
selflessness over narcissism.

07:00.987 --> 07:02.822
- You did read it.
- I did.

07:03.656 --> 07:05.224
Excuse me, Miss Lords,

07:05.858 --> 07:07.627
- I can take you to the green room.
- Great.

07:09.829 --> 07:10.797
Nice to meet you.

07:17.069 --> 07:18.037
Okay...

07:19.272 --> 07:21.374
I'm not sure, but I believe that woman

07:21.440 --> 07:23.576
just threw a whole hell
of a lot of shade at me.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.279
Like blot-out-the-sun shade.

07:26.345 --> 07:30.750
All right, we haven't confirmed it yet,
but Ty heard

07:32.251 --> 07:33.553
that she's dating Lee.

07:37.323 --> 07:38.991
You gotta be freakin' kidding me.

07:39.725 --> 07:41.961
That's why the woman was so salty.

07:42.028 --> 07:44.897
Lee wouldn't talk shit
about you like that, would he?

07:45.998 --> 07:47.900
- All he'd have to do is talk to you.
- Okay.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.203
She could be salty with everybody.

07:51.003 --> 07:52.071
Yeah.

07:52.138 --> 07:55.041
Mary Jane, I can't believe
that they're throwing this at me now.

07:55.107 --> 07:56.943
- What?
- The Jessie Lords interview.

07:57.009 --> 07:58.678
Apparently, they want me to do it.

08:00.947 --> 08:03.282
Salty. The bitch is salty.

08:03.349 --> 08:04.483
Look who's salty.

08:05.084 --> 08:08.654
Her! 'Cause she has to follow me.
I'll be salty too.

08:14.527 --> 08:15.561
Morning, dad.

08:16.128 --> 08:17.129
Morning, son.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.568
Mom's on strike or something?

08:24.270 --> 08:25.404
She's not here.

08:27.306 --> 08:29.575
Your mother and I decided
to take some time apart.

08:30.142 --> 08:32.545
You finally had it out about that leak
in the guest room?

08:33.112 --> 08:34.614
I told you to call a repairman.

08:36.949 --> 08:38.851
No, no, it's not about the leak, son.

08:40.586 --> 08:41.554
What's goin' on?

08:43.689 --> 08:45.224
I think you should ask your mother.

08:52.531 --> 08:57.003
Jessie, look, I know why you requested
Emma for the interview.

08:57.336 --> 08:59.105
Obviously, Lee gave you all the dirt

08:59.171 --> 09:00.273
- about me, so...
- No.

09:00.339 --> 09:02.475
- There are two sides to every story.
- Hold on.

09:02.541 --> 09:03.843
I didn't ask for Emma.

09:04.577 --> 09:06.012
The producer guy, Garrett,

09:06.078 --> 09:09.015
said he wanted to pair me
with a correspondent who has kids.

09:10.349 --> 09:12.451
Right. Emma has kids.

09:13.085 --> 09:14.887
Lee hasn't said much about you.

09:15.521 --> 09:16.789
At all, actually.

09:16.856 --> 09:19.659
I think he worked through his issues
with his comedy routine.

09:19.725 --> 09:22.428
That's part for the course, right?
I'm sure half of New York

09:22.495 --> 09:23.930
has heard about our break-up.

09:23.996 --> 09:25.631
That audience will get a lot wider.

09:25.698 --> 09:27.700
- What do you mean?
- It all happened so fast.

09:27.767 --> 09:29.702
One minute he's doing stand-up about you,

09:30.069 --> 09:33.572
the next, he's selling
a pilot to a major studio.

09:34.807 --> 09:37.710
- That's Hollywood for you, right?
- Wait, I'm sorry. Hold...

09:38.077 --> 09:41.647
Hold up, Jessie.
So, Lee is making a TV show?

09:41.714 --> 09:43.449
- Yes.
- About our break-up?

09:43.749 --> 09:44.717
Yes.

10:01.367 --> 10:02.368
What did I miss?

10:03.169 --> 10:04.670
We are in full crisis mode.

10:05.705 --> 10:07.974
Don't tell me
another bomb was dropped on you.

10:08.040 --> 10:09.842
It's like World War III up in this bitch.

10:09.909 --> 10:13.846
Lee wrote a TV pilot based
on his stand-up about our break-up.

10:13.913 --> 10:15.181
What? Are you kidding me?

10:15.247 --> 10:18.584
Even the assistants at CAA are buzzing.
They claim your character said,

10:18.651 --> 10:21.287
"Tell me you love me" on the first night.
Who's gonna buy that?

10:24.023 --> 10:27.226
Okay, no one will believe it's true.
Anyway, let's just figure this out.

10:27.293 --> 10:30.930
I just wanna step out of the spotlight,
and I keep getting pulled back in.

10:30.997 --> 10:33.099
You're a celebrity.
There's no stepping out.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.701
Maybe the show won't go,
and I won't have to talk about it.

10:35.768 --> 10:39.071
No, the rumor mill is in full effect.
It's already generating publicity.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.974
So what do I do?
How do I get in front of the story?

10:42.041 --> 10:43.209
Control the narrative.

10:43.275 --> 10:45.811
Your story with Lee's gonna be told
with our without you.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.546
So I tell the story first.

10:47.847 --> 10:51.150
In fact, Ryan Seacrest
has been asking for an interview.

10:51.717 --> 10:53.619
All you have to do is congratulate Lee

10:53.686 --> 10:56.622
on his ability to find the humor
in a mundane break-up.

10:57.857 --> 10:59.158
Or you could do a statement.

10:59.492 --> 11:03.662
No Seacrest. I want my core audience
to know how I get down.

11:04.263 --> 11:06.532
Let's do the interview
with "The Breakfast Club."

11:06.599 --> 11:09.268
Yeah, yeah, and then let
the other media outlets pick it up.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.239
I can do this
because I genuinely wish Lee well.

11:13.305 --> 11:14.707
Yeah, honey, you know,

11:14.774 --> 11:18.144
I'm sure you feel that way,
but this is shock jock radio.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.146
- Yeah.
- They'll bait you to dish the dirt.

11:20.212 --> 11:22.381
I'm a journalist.
I know how to play the game.

11:24.316 --> 11:27.520
All right. I'll set it up.
We should definitely run through

11:27.586 --> 11:29.021
talking points before you go on.

11:29.088 --> 11:30.523
- Yes.
- I'm always prepared.

11:30.589 --> 11:33.692
I will have them so wrapped tightly
around my little finger

11:33.759 --> 11:35.227
they're gonna think I'm the saint.

11:37.997 --> 11:41.267
Orlando's here. I'm sorry, baby girl,
I wish I could help more,

11:41.333 --> 11:43.769
but you know what?
Your public image is in good hands

11:43.836 --> 11:45.271
with this smart one right here.

11:45.337 --> 11:46.272
Okay.

11:55.181 --> 11:56.816
There'll be time for that soon.

11:56.882 --> 11:59.085
Right now,
we have to work on your segment.

11:59.151 --> 12:00.586
You'll kill it in the ratings.

12:00.653 --> 12:03.589
Everybody's talking about
how brave you and your teammates are.

12:03.656 --> 12:04.723
- Really?
- Yep.

12:04.790 --> 12:08.094
I figured everyone would think
we were ripping off Kaepernick's protest.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.996
Please. If every Latino player
did what you're doing,

12:11.063 --> 12:12.998
you'd be getting calls
from world leaders.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.634
I'm trying to figure out
how to retire, not start a civil war.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.438
- Does that mean you...?
- Spoke to Marco? Yeah.

12:19.972 --> 12:21.107
And he's down with it.

12:21.173 --> 12:22.141
The segment.

12:22.975 --> 12:24.410
And retirement, yes.

12:24.777 --> 12:26.712
Once I told him
it's what I wanted, he got it.

12:26.779 --> 12:28.114
I'm so proud of you.

12:29.515 --> 12:31.951
- And Gumbel's people? Are they coming?
- They sure are.

12:32.251 --> 12:34.320
Big things are gonna happen for us, papi.

12:36.489 --> 12:37.990
You can't put me back on the board.

12:38.891 --> 12:39.992
Look,

12:40.059 --> 12:42.928
I went too far with that interview
with the school board member,

12:42.995 --> 12:46.765
but I can learn from my mistakes.
All I'm asking for is one story.

12:46.832 --> 12:49.435
With what you pulled,
getting benched was an act of mercy.

12:49.935 --> 12:53.639
I'm sorry. If there's anything
I can do to convince you, I'll do it.

12:54.373 --> 12:58.043
I appreciate that, but for now,
my decision stands.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.660
That's 15 stitches
for your bitches, playboy.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.496
Put the phone down, old man.

13:17.563 --> 13:19.365
Get ready to get your ass whooped.
Come on.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.568
Twenty.

13:23.602 --> 13:25.271
All right. All right. Damn.

13:25.337 --> 13:27.673
If you ever gonna talk smack,
now's your chance.

13:27.740 --> 13:30.643
Talking smack doesn't make you better
at anything. Practice does.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.145
Fifteen.

13:33.212 --> 13:34.747
So you play this a lot?

13:34.813 --> 13:36.482
Every addict needs his diversions.

13:36.949 --> 13:39.185
Even after all that time,

13:39.485 --> 13:42.021
you're still worried
that people look at you differently?

13:42.588 --> 13:43.589
Ten, old boy.

13:43.856 --> 13:46.926
I lost some friends along the way,
but my family stuck by me.

13:46.992 --> 13:48.060
That's all that matters.

13:48.327 --> 13:49.929
Wish my family was like that.

13:49.995 --> 13:50.963
Well.

13:51.964 --> 13:54.833
The thing is,
other people can support you too.

13:55.467 --> 13:57.036
It doesn't matter if it's your kin.

13:57.102 --> 14:00.139
What matters is you get
the support you need, however it comes.

14:01.473 --> 14:03.909
What I'm trying to say is
I got your back.

14:04.743 --> 14:07.313
But it doesn't mean I'll stop
whoopin' your ass at this game.

14:08.113 --> 14:09.114
Domino, son!

14:13.219 --> 14:16.789
I'll be in your ear the whole time.
Whatever you need, I'm gonna talk to you.

14:16.855 --> 14:19.558
- I'll guide you.
- What's Hamptons doing with Agent Smith?

14:20.926 --> 14:24.096
Dani's fans called Garrett out online
for benching her.

14:24.163 --> 14:25.931
So he's feeling a little threatened.

14:25.998 --> 14:28.667
She sicced her rabid supporters on him?
That's gangsta.

14:29.768 --> 14:33.105
Well, I can't prove it.
But she's definitely not denouncing it.

14:34.807 --> 14:37.476
"Garrett Keswick is an alt-left libtard

14:37.843 --> 14:40.613
who should stick to modeling J. Crew
and stay out of fake news."

14:41.714 --> 14:43.616
- What? That's it?
- We covered a dance show

14:43.682 --> 14:45.784
and a celebrity self-help book today.

14:46.352 --> 14:49.355
Political extremism
is definitely new territory for him.

14:49.955 --> 14:52.191
You should tell him
to try being a black woman on TV.

14:53.125 --> 14:54.760
Or any woman with an opinion.

14:54.827 --> 14:57.396
<i>Lesley Jones' trolls make his
look like Christmas elves.</i>

14:57.463 --> 15:00.566
If she'd got a bodyguard
every time someone threatened to drive

15:00.633 --> 15:02.801
a spike up her vagina,
she'd have an army.

15:03.135 --> 15:05.037
What's got you all up in arms, girl?

15:05.104 --> 15:06.605
<i>I got ahold of Lee's script.</i>

15:07.506 --> 15:08.941
Was it worse than you thought?

15:09.008 --> 15:11.176
Let's just say my character
makes Cookie Lyon's

15:11.243 --> 15:13.279
look like a Sunday school teacher.

15:13.712 --> 15:14.980
Hold on one second, M.J.

15:15.047 --> 15:16.382
I need to tell you something.

15:16.448 --> 15:17.783
<i>- Should I let you go?
- No, no.</i>

15:19.952 --> 15:22.454
Is Marco coming
to join us again for dinner?

15:22.521 --> 15:24.423
No, that's what I'm trying to tell you.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.861
<i>What's going on?</i>

15:29.328 --> 15:30.596
Hi. Can I help you?

15:30.663 --> 15:31.797
Orlando!

15:37.036 --> 15:39.505
Kara, I want you to meet my mom.

15:43.242 --> 15:44.209
<i>Kara?</i>

15:45.344 --> 15:49.615
Mary Jane, I've gotta call you back.
Orlando's mother just walked in.

15:49.682 --> 15:50.783
<i>Holy shit!</i>

15:50.849 --> 15:54.420
Mom, dessert is on its way, you
gonna tell me what's going on?

15:57.089 --> 15:58.757
Well, what did your father tell you?

15:59.224 --> 16:00.559
He told me to talk to you.

16:10.903 --> 16:12.905
Before I was with your father,

16:14.740 --> 16:17.776
I fell in love with a young serviceman

16:20.346 --> 16:21.847
and that man was Frank.

16:24.016 --> 16:25.851
- Dad's friend who just showed up?
- Right.

16:26.285 --> 16:30.389
It has been 44 years
since I've laid eyes on Frank.

16:31.156 --> 16:35.461
I just never expected
those feelings to come rushing back.

16:35.527 --> 16:36.628
Wait, wait.

16:38.097 --> 16:39.098
You're not saying...

16:40.332 --> 16:41.867
You're not steppin' out on dad.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.469
It's more complicated than that.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.105
If you were so in love,
how did you and dad end up together?

16:46.171 --> 16:47.406
Your father was a good man.

16:48.941 --> 16:50.476
And he always cared for me.

16:52.144 --> 16:53.579
That doesn't answer my question.

16:54.380 --> 16:58.951
Patrick, you've gotta understand
that this was a different time, the '70s.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.455
Now when Frank re-enlisted,

17:05.357 --> 17:06.759
I was in a bind.

17:07.760 --> 17:08.727
A bind?

17:09.128 --> 17:10.062
And

17:11.697 --> 17:12.898
your father stepped up.

17:13.332 --> 17:14.400
What kind of bind?

17:16.935 --> 17:17.903
Pregnant?

17:19.772 --> 17:21.073
Man, I don't wanna hear this.

17:21.540 --> 17:22.841
But, Patrick...

17:24.042 --> 17:27.346
Paul will always be your father. Always.

17:28.580 --> 17:29.782
But Frank...

17:32.251 --> 17:33.385
He's your blood.

17:34.319 --> 17:35.254
Blood?

17:36.155 --> 17:37.289
- Patrick.
- Look, no!

17:38.991 --> 17:40.392
- Patrick.
- No! No!

17:43.562 --> 17:44.763
I'm sorry.

17:46.765 --> 17:49.635
Delphine. My goodness!

17:50.269 --> 17:52.838
It's so great to meet you.

17:54.907 --> 17:56.341
Well, we would have met sooner,

17:56.408 --> 17:59.411
but Orlando might've mentioned
I was in Miami the past few months,

17:59.478 --> 18:01.213
helping my sister with her newborn.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.515
My goodness,
you have a sister with a newborn?

18:03.582 --> 18:04.550
Yes!

18:09.221 --> 18:10.122
Cute.

18:11.423 --> 18:14.259
But Marco tells me
you're the woman behind my son

18:14.326 --> 18:17.196
speaking on all these sports shows.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.831
Kara's a great producer.

18:18.897 --> 18:20.432
Well, if everything works out,

18:20.499 --> 18:23.268
Orlando's gonna be
the face of a new show very soon.

18:23.335 --> 18:27.139
Are you? Well, something more
to celebrate this afternoon.

18:27.473 --> 18:28.841
- Yes.
- This afternoon?

18:29.975 --> 18:31.143
I hope you don't mind.

18:31.210 --> 18:34.847
I planned a little reunion celebration
at the park in our neighborhood.

18:35.347 --> 18:38.450
I always like to do it
whenever he's been away for a stretch.

18:38.517 --> 18:39.618
It'll be fun.

18:39.685 --> 18:42.488
I'm sure you'll be very surprised
to see where Orlando came from.

18:43.522 --> 18:44.756
I'm already surprised.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.326
- To Orlando.
- To Orlando.

18:56.869 --> 18:59.238
Mr. Lagos, Mr. Lagos!
Will you sign my ball?

18:59.304 --> 19:00.272
Yes, sure.

19:01.206 --> 19:03.842
It's like watching
a whole team of little Orlandos.

19:04.276 --> 19:06.812
I wish he would make a team
of mini-Orlandos himself,

19:06.879 --> 19:07.846
you know what I mean?

19:10.415 --> 19:12.885
I already have two of my own.
They're teenagers.

19:12.951 --> 19:14.653
They live in Atlanta with their father.

19:14.953 --> 19:16.388
Your kids aren't here with you?

19:17.789 --> 19:18.957
I go back and forth.

19:20.259 --> 19:22.227
That's why I don't see you at the games.

19:22.661 --> 19:25.731
Well... I have to work, you know?

19:26.498 --> 19:27.466
Too bad.

19:28.333 --> 19:30.769
I never missed any of Orlando's games
when he was a boy.

19:31.870 --> 19:34.339
Really? Gosh, that's great.

19:36.408 --> 19:38.143
I knew he was born to play baseball

19:38.210 --> 19:40.646
from the time
he was old enough to hold a bat.

19:41.613 --> 19:42.581
That young?

19:42.881 --> 19:45.651
In high school he got distracted
by girls here and there.

19:46.585 --> 19:47.986
But you kept him on track.

19:48.987 --> 19:50.055
And that's why I'm here.

19:50.722 --> 19:51.823
To keep him on track?

19:51.890 --> 19:56.528
My son won't be retiring from baseball
any time soon.

20:03.502 --> 20:04.436
Hi, papi!

20:10.842 --> 20:13.011
You saw those kids' faces today.
They look up to me.

20:13.712 --> 20:16.748
And they will still look up to you
when you're a broadcaster.

20:17.049 --> 20:20.218
Wearing a suit and tie on TV
ain't inspiring, not to those kids.

20:20.285 --> 20:23.422
Orlando, they have a much better chance
of wearing a suit and tie

20:23.488 --> 20:25.157
than they do baseball cleats.

20:27.492 --> 20:28.527
Papi,

20:28.594 --> 20:30.929
you don't think
I see how envious you look

20:30.996 --> 20:33.031
when you see those guys
at "Sports Center"

20:33.098 --> 20:34.633
doing what you wanna be doing?

20:35.300 --> 20:36.602
But what if it doesn't work out?

20:37.169 --> 20:39.638
Look at Tiki Barber.
He went for it, and now where is he?

20:39.705 --> 20:42.841
I know it's a big risk, baby,
but listen to me.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.676
Look how far you've come.

20:45.777 --> 20:48.280
I remember when you first got
in front of an anchor desk.

20:48.347 --> 20:51.383
You could barely get two words out.
Come on!

20:51.917 --> 20:55.687
And look at you. You've got
major networks knocking on your door.

20:55.754 --> 20:58.423
- Are you gonna choke?
- Look, I'm not choking. It...

21:00.392 --> 21:01.560
Do you want this?

21:04.096 --> 21:05.197
What about you?

21:06.832 --> 21:09.935
If I remember well, I'm not the only one
who's trying to get somewhere.

21:10.202 --> 21:11.336
You had big plans too.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.939
I know. I've been a bit gun shy
since I got back to "GDU".

21:14.006 --> 21:16.208
Yes, and meanwhile,
Justin's making all the moves.

21:19.378 --> 21:20.946
- Well...
- Mama?

21:22.881 --> 21:24.483
I can start to plan my future

21:24.549 --> 21:27.319
if you agree to go through
with the segment tomorrow.

21:28.954 --> 21:30.756
- Game on.
- Game on.

21:31.056 --> 21:34.092
All right, and do you know what?
Why don't we invite Delphine

21:34.159 --> 21:35.761
so she can watch you in action.

21:37.596 --> 21:38.530
Okay.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.102
Kara! Kara!

21:44.536 --> 21:47.539
And you must be Mary Jane Paul!

21:50.442 --> 21:52.844
You look so pretty!

21:53.178 --> 21:57.182
It's so great to meet
a real life famous person!

21:58.016 --> 22:01.119
I put my heels on one at a time,
like everybody else.

22:01.787 --> 22:03.055
- Begrudgingly.
- Hi.

22:03.121 --> 22:05.190
I'm Aaliyah, Mary Jane's publicist.

22:05.857 --> 22:08.026
And I'm Ty, her hairstylist.

22:08.093 --> 22:11.663
So does Orlando get
his own stylist and publicist too?

22:11.730 --> 22:14.399
If he knocks this segment
out of the park, he just may.

22:14.466 --> 22:17.836
Delphine, I thought maybe we could do
a little quick tour around the place,

22:17.903 --> 22:20.405
- to show you how everything operates.
- Sounds good.

22:20.739 --> 22:23.675
I really need to caffeinate here.
It's way too early for me.

22:23.975 --> 22:26.578
- It's right over there. Help yourself.
- Yes, yes.

22:27.746 --> 22:29.214
This is genius.

22:29.915 --> 22:31.450
She's basically you.

22:31.717 --> 22:34.486
I have nothing in common with that woman.

22:35.387 --> 22:36.521
Thanks, mama!

22:36.588 --> 22:37.556
See?

22:38.824 --> 22:40.125
Stop it. Delphine!

22:41.259 --> 22:43.495
We're gonna go look
at the control room, okay?

22:43.562 --> 22:44.596
Yeah, yeah.

22:44.863 --> 22:47.232
- They even walk alike.
- It's so creepy.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.969
- You ready to prep for the interview?
- To the Batcave.

22:54.606 --> 22:56.274
Okay, the goal is

22:57.109 --> 22:58.210
to make me look good.

22:58.944 --> 23:01.480
I wanna be
as clean as a Sunday school teacher.

23:01.546 --> 23:02.714
- Got it?
- Got it.

23:02.781 --> 23:04.750
I'll play Charlemagne, and you be you.

23:05.050 --> 23:08.186
I know you can handle the softballs
so let's get right to the dirt.

23:09.621 --> 23:12.924
Is it true? Are you the girlfriend
in Lee's new sitcom?

23:12.991 --> 23:16.695
First, let me point out that this is
loosely based on our relationship,

23:17.095 --> 23:20.365
and that there are some creative licenses

23:20.432 --> 23:23.568
to be taken into account
on these types of projects.

23:23.635 --> 23:25.570
You're not mad
at being portrayed like a hoe?

23:25.837 --> 23:28.540
That's... What? That's what you took away
from the script?

23:28.607 --> 23:30.876
It's a potential question
that could come up.

23:31.510 --> 23:32.544
Back to the interview.

23:32.611 --> 23:35.547
- Okay.
- So, is it opinion or fact?

23:35.614 --> 23:37.315
There's two sides to every story.

23:37.382 --> 23:41.553
Did you step out on your man,
your loyal man, your black unicorn?

23:41.620 --> 23:44.990
Okay, first of all, he wasn't a unicorn,
and we were practically broken up...

23:45.056 --> 23:48.026
- When you cheated.
- There's always a reason

23:48.693 --> 23:50.629
for why we do what we do.

23:51.062 --> 23:52.597
I jumped into things with Lee,

23:53.365 --> 23:57.302
but I was still dealing
with a broken mindset

23:58.303 --> 24:00.605
from years of heartbreak
from past relationships.

24:00.872 --> 24:04.109
Okay, that just sounds
like you're not taking responsibility

24:04.176 --> 24:05.877
- for your actions.
- I'm happy for Lee.

24:06.178 --> 24:07.813
You know? I really am.

24:07.879 --> 24:10.849
But let's admit his project
is trafficking in

24:10.916 --> 24:14.820
the same tired-ass tropes
that Black women are crazy.

24:15.153 --> 24:18.356
Black women are promiscuous.
Black women are angry.

24:18.423 --> 24:21.359
But have black men ever
taken responsibility

24:21.426 --> 24:22.861
for driving us to that?

24:22.928 --> 24:26.264
We live in a society that treats us
like we're the bottom of the barrel

24:26.331 --> 24:27.566
when it comes to romance.

24:27.632 --> 24:31.036
Couple that with having
to constantly prove ourselves

24:31.102 --> 24:33.371
as worthy enough, right?

24:33.672 --> 24:37.542
Be confident, girl, but not intimidating.
Be smart, but not emasculating.

24:37.609 --> 24:39.811
Never enough, but too much.

24:39.878 --> 24:42.147
Too damn much all at the same damn time.

24:42.214 --> 24:45.417
Men are encouraged
to objectify our bodies,

24:45.483 --> 24:47.853
but the second we search
for sexual satisfaction,

24:48.253 --> 24:50.055
baby, we are called whores.

24:50.121 --> 24:53.859
Okay, Mary Jane, I think
we should stop right there.

24:54.259 --> 24:57.529
- I don't think you're ready for this.
- Somebody needs to say this,

24:57.596 --> 24:59.464
and it might as well be me.
I'm qualified.

24:59.531 --> 25:02.000
Okay,
but you're all over the place right now.

25:02.067 --> 25:04.402
I mean, you're heated,
emotional, defensive.

25:04.803 --> 25:07.505
- Girl, you sound bitter.
- And you sound like everybody else.

25:09.374 --> 25:11.009
When they talk about black women...

25:13.645 --> 25:14.880
Nobody ever asks,

25:15.747 --> 25:16.982
"How? Why?

25:18.984 --> 25:20.285
Why do they feel like this?"

25:22.053 --> 25:23.355
Look at my relationship.

25:24.656 --> 25:27.492
I was tempted to cheat on Lee
before Justin. Never did it.

25:29.127 --> 25:30.962
But how did I get to that point?

25:32.631 --> 25:33.732
Is it because I...

25:34.466 --> 25:37.269
I think I don't deserve a guy like Lee?

25:38.436 --> 25:39.571
And if that's the case,

25:39.638 --> 25:42.073
what does that say
about my relationship with Justin?

25:42.340 --> 25:43.341
Okay, look...

25:45.210 --> 25:46.978
I know you have a lot on your mind now.

25:47.045 --> 25:48.146
Well, yeah.

25:48.213 --> 25:51.149
But if you say
any of this during the interview,

25:51.216 --> 25:53.351
people will think you're crazy.
As your friend.

25:53.418 --> 25:54.386
Don't get it twisted.

25:55.654 --> 25:59.457
Right now,
you are my publicist, not my friend.

26:00.358 --> 26:03.461
Can you get this done, Aaliyah,
or do I need to find someone else?

26:04.996 --> 26:07.565
I always get the job done and I will.

26:07.999 --> 26:11.069
But remember
why you hired me in the first place.

26:11.436 --> 26:12.771
I'm not a yes woman.

26:13.371 --> 26:15.540
So, if that's the kind of company
you wanna keep,

26:16.274 --> 26:17.742
I might not be right for the job.

26:22.881 --> 26:25.917
So, my son wears make-up now?

26:26.584 --> 26:28.486
It's just part of being on camera, ma.

26:28.553 --> 26:30.155
I don't want him to look foolish.

26:30.555 --> 26:32.724
Didn't you say
you wanted him to have a stylist?

26:32.791 --> 26:35.593
To do his hair,
not to make him look like a girl.

26:35.660 --> 26:38.830
You know what?
Michael Strahan is not complaining,

26:38.897 --> 26:41.533
and he's making
twenty million on GMA right now.

26:41.599 --> 26:42.834
Twenty million dollars?

26:43.568 --> 26:46.371
And he's more recognizable now
than he ever was in the NFL.

26:47.639 --> 26:49.841
Don't worry, your boy's in good hands.
I got him.

26:49.908 --> 26:50.842
Yes, I am.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.413
You know what?

26:55.480 --> 26:57.682
Why don't I have Hopper
take you to the green room.

26:57.749 --> 27:00.285
They have tons of snacks.
It's a wonderful room.

27:00.352 --> 27:03.621
Hopper, can you take Delphine
to the green room for me?

27:03.688 --> 27:05.557
- Sure.
- Show her around a little bit.

27:05.623 --> 27:06.624
I'll see you in a bit.

27:07.158 --> 27:08.259
- Kara?
- Yes?

27:08.326 --> 27:10.929
I need to speak with you and Orlando
before the segment.

27:10.996 --> 27:12.230
- Okay. Yeah.
- Sure.

27:12.297 --> 27:16.901
How would you two feel
if Dani sat in on Orlando's interview?

27:16.968 --> 27:19.738
No. You're doing this
because the trolls are getting to you,

27:19.804 --> 27:22.640
- It's not the way to handle it.
- I think this is the perfect place

27:22.707 --> 27:25.477
to put Dani's brand of celebrity
to good use,

27:25.844 --> 27:29.147
and it will also be approaching the story
from both sides of the debate.

27:29.214 --> 27:30.215
Garrett,

27:30.582 --> 27:34.786
if you give in to Dani's demands,
you empower her trolls.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.889
Wait, Dani... She's the
conservative one, right?

27:37.956 --> 27:38.923
Yes.

27:39.524 --> 27:42.060
I think it'd be a good idea
to have her ask me some questions.

27:42.660 --> 27:44.095
No, no.

27:44.162 --> 27:46.765
- She'll tear you apart.
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.

27:47.032 --> 27:51.269
Look, Dani knows that she'll have to keep
her opinions in check.

27:51.336 --> 27:54.072
If she would have known that,
you wouldn't have had to bench her.

27:54.906 --> 27:58.543
Besides, Orlando's not prepared
for this kind of an interview.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.380
But if I can take her on,
that will embolden the protest.

28:06.785 --> 28:07.752
Gosh.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.522
Garrett, will you give us a minute?

28:10.989 --> 28:11.956
Yeah, of course.

28:17.562 --> 28:18.663
- Okay.
- It's fine.

28:18.730 --> 28:19.697
No.

28:20.565 --> 28:21.566
I have to ask.

28:21.900 --> 28:25.036
Are you looking for a way
to sabotage this interview

28:25.103 --> 28:26.938
to give your mother what she wants?

28:27.505 --> 28:29.441
Damn, Kara. Have a little faith.

28:31.176 --> 28:35.013
Okay, but Bryant Gumbel's producers
are in there right now.

28:35.080 --> 28:37.382
Your whole future is riding on this.

28:38.083 --> 28:39.117
I'll survive.

28:43.154 --> 28:44.122
Okay.

28:52.530 --> 28:55.967
In today's political environment,
"protest" has become an everyday word,

28:56.034 --> 28:59.270
and it's hitting the baseball diamond
as some of the top Latino players

28:59.337 --> 29:01.673
are refusing to stand
during the National Anthem.

29:02.307 --> 29:04.375
And one of those players
is here with us today.

29:04.442 --> 29:07.579
New York second baseman, Orlando Lagos.
Thank you for being here.

29:07.645 --> 29:09.914
- Thank you for having me.
- Orlando, tell us,

29:09.981 --> 29:11.483
your team's doing great right now.

29:12.117 --> 29:13.585
- Why do this?
- We're standing up

29:13.651 --> 29:16.087
'cause we believe that Latinos
are unfairly targeted

29:16.154 --> 29:18.289
<i>- for deportation.
- Come on, you can tell me.</i>

29:18.356 --> 29:19.757
<i>You hate America, don't you?</i>

29:20.658 --> 29:23.128
- Who is this bitch?
- You don't wanna know.

29:23.194 --> 29:26.197
But, really, do you think
this is the right way to make a change?

29:26.498 --> 29:29.000
I do. I do. It doesn't
mean that it's the only way.

29:29.501 --> 29:32.303
You can donate money
to the ACLU and other organizations,

29:32.370 --> 29:36.040
but it seems that sitting
gets people's attention a lot quicker.

29:36.107 --> 29:38.510
So do you mean
that you're out to seek attention

29:38.576 --> 29:40.345
at the cost of your own patriotism?

29:41.079 --> 29:42.981
- I'm patriotic, I...
- Let me just step in

29:43.047 --> 29:46.417
and say that we can all be patriotic
and have concerns for our government.

29:46.484 --> 29:48.186
- Right.
- Of course. But sitting down

29:48.253 --> 29:50.155
during your nation's anthem?

29:50.221 --> 29:53.491
Some Americans would say that would be
the equivalent of flag burning.

29:53.558 --> 29:54.759
Which is legal, isn't it?

29:54.826 --> 29:57.495
Yeah, ISIS does it all the time,
but does that make it right?

29:57.562 --> 29:59.831
Did she just compare
my son to a terrorist?

30:00.532 --> 30:03.034
<i>The protest
has nothing to do with terrorism.</i>

30:03.101 --> 30:04.235
I wanna talk to him.

30:04.302 --> 30:05.336
Orlando?

30:06.638 --> 30:08.806
You need to change the conversation
right now.

30:08.873 --> 30:11.943
Talk about your upbringing,
your version of America.

30:12.577 --> 30:13.845
Talk to her about your mom.

30:14.479 --> 30:15.446
Dani,

30:16.181 --> 30:17.582
you like Ronald Reagan, right?

30:17.649 --> 30:19.450
He was a great republican.

30:19.517 --> 30:21.386
And what about his stance on immigration?

30:21.719 --> 30:24.856
My mom was one of three million people
granted amnesty back in 1986

30:24.923 --> 30:27.458
when he passed
his Immigration Reform and Control Act.

30:27.525 --> 30:30.528
But it's not 1986. We have terrorists

30:30.595 --> 30:32.697
- streaming into our country.
- No, it isn't.

30:32.764 --> 30:35.400
But that was the time
when even conservative politicians

30:35.466 --> 30:37.869
saw immigration for what it is,
a humanitarian issue.

30:37.936 --> 30:39.938
My mom risked her life
because she believed

30:40.004 --> 30:41.639
the words on the Statue of Liberty.

30:41.706 --> 30:43.374
But she did break the law.

30:44.142 --> 30:47.212
Yes, but if Reagan had looked at it
that way, I wouldn't be here today.

30:47.278 --> 30:49.614
- Because your mom would've been deported.
- Exactly.

30:50.014 --> 30:54.185
But if she can defy those odds
and crawl her way to a better life,

30:54.252 --> 30:55.753
<i>then certainly I can weather</i>

30:55.820 --> 30:58.423
sitting before a game
and dealing with internet trolls.

30:58.489 --> 31:01.326
<i>In my mind, standing up for an America
that models the words</i>

31:01.392 --> 31:03.795
"Give me your tired, your poor,
your huddled masses,

31:03.861 --> 31:05.230
yearning to breathe free,"

31:05.663 --> 31:07.599
that's the most patriotic thing I can do.

31:07.665 --> 31:08.700
Inspiring.

31:09.367 --> 31:12.203
How would your mom feel
about you besmirching a country

31:12.270 --> 31:14.739
that she worked so hard to get to?

31:15.440 --> 31:18.610
Some people would say
the fact you don't realize your privilege

31:18.910 --> 31:20.645
is the greatest tragedy of all.

31:20.712 --> 31:22.513
We all live with privilege, Dani.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.949
At least I'm trying to use mine for good.

31:25.750 --> 31:26.851
<i>And we're clear.</i>

31:29.120 --> 31:30.221
Kara. Kara.

31:30.288 --> 31:33.191
You know, I always hoped
Orlando would be like Bo Jackson,

31:33.258 --> 31:36.027
dominating two pro sports
at the same time.

31:36.094 --> 31:38.329
- Delphine, I know...
- But this is even better.

31:38.396 --> 31:41.032
I mean, what I just saw
was one big contact sport.

31:41.099 --> 31:45.169
And that little firecracker
was as scary as any linebacker.

31:45.937 --> 31:47.005
Yeah.

31:47.071 --> 31:48.873
But he held his own.

31:49.207 --> 31:50.642
And he seemed to enjoy doing it.

31:51.976 --> 31:52.944
So?

31:58.016 --> 31:59.984
You were amazing.

32:00.385 --> 32:03.221
Orlando, a player is nothing
without his coaches,

32:03.288 --> 32:07.492
and this lady here is a damn good coach.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.362
I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for her.

32:15.667 --> 32:17.035
Congratulations.

32:17.535 --> 32:20.805
I just heard Orlando
kick Dani's ass back to Ponca City.

32:20.872 --> 32:22.206
Yes, he did.

32:22.674 --> 32:25.943
You know, it feels so good
to fight for the important stuff and win.

32:26.978 --> 32:30.982
But, listen, we have to talk
about your "Breakfast Club" interview.

32:32.050 --> 32:34.085
Aaliyah told me
about your little prep session.

32:34.852 --> 32:37.555
She needs to be scheduling the interview,
not running to you.

32:37.622 --> 32:39.691
- Don't be mad at her.
- She called me crazy.

32:39.757 --> 32:40.892
Well, you are crazy.

32:41.192 --> 32:43.061
I can say that, and you can say that,

32:43.127 --> 32:45.096
but she hasn't earned
the right to say that.

32:45.163 --> 32:48.599
Look, just go easy on her.
We both know that she's smart as a whip.

32:48.666 --> 32:51.235
She's pretty much been right
about everything, Mary Jane.

32:52.337 --> 32:56.641
All this stuff that you're dealing with,
like Simone's death, and Lee's ex,

32:56.708 --> 32:59.911
and the TV show, and Justin being gone,

32:59.977 --> 33:03.047
this is all getting in your head,
and you're spiraling.

33:03.314 --> 33:04.549
- It's that obvious?
- Yes.

33:04.816 --> 33:08.853
You need to focus on yourself
and what you care about: your work.

33:08.920 --> 33:10.922
My work wearing sombreros

33:11.255 --> 33:13.191
and making up stories about my boyfriend?

33:13.257 --> 33:15.593
We need to get back
to the real Mary Jane.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.029
The old Mary Jane.

33:18.096 --> 33:19.630
Well, yeah, I would love that.

33:19.897 --> 33:24.402
I would love to do a deep dive
into an important story like we used to.

33:24.469 --> 33:27.572
But the problem is
we signed up for morning TV

33:27.638 --> 33:29.040
where fluff always wins.

33:29.107 --> 33:32.543
Well, then, you know what?
Let's get us a prime time special.

33:34.278 --> 33:38.149
A one-hour, in-depth story
about something you really care about.

33:38.216 --> 33:39.317
That would be amazing.

33:39.817 --> 33:42.854
But it takes most anchors years
before they get something like that.

33:43.154 --> 33:44.255
You just leave that to me.

33:44.889 --> 33:48.126
In the meantime,
you need to apologize to Aaliyah.

34:08.379 --> 34:09.547
Where have you been?

34:11.115 --> 34:12.383
You movin' out too?

34:14.185 --> 34:15.253
Why didn't you tell me?

34:19.757 --> 34:23.294
I raised you as my own son.
That's all that matters.

34:23.361 --> 34:24.729
That's not all that matters!

34:25.563 --> 34:28.065
This was your mother's secret to tell,
not mine.

34:28.733 --> 34:31.335
My entire life is a lie,
a lie that you created!

34:31.803 --> 34:33.104
Why would you do this to me?

34:34.305 --> 34:37.208
I'm in just as much pain as you are, son.

34:37.275 --> 34:40.411
Don't...! Don't call me that!
Don't call me son!

34:40.478 --> 34:44.649
You don't think that I'm not mad
that she chose that degenerate addict

34:44.715 --> 34:45.750
- over me?
- What?

34:47.452 --> 34:48.586
Frank was an addict too?

34:49.487 --> 34:51.656
Alcohol. Gambling. Who knows what?

34:52.290 --> 34:54.625
What? All these years
I struggled with drugs,

34:54.692 --> 34:56.294
you nearly disowned me,

34:56.360 --> 34:58.529
and you didn't think
to tell me it was in my blood?

34:58.596 --> 35:00.031
That would not have helped.

35:00.531 --> 35:03.034
It would be just another excuse.

35:05.403 --> 35:07.171
I am still your father.

35:12.743 --> 35:15.279
And I'm just as mad at her as you are.

35:29.494 --> 35:32.530
Aaliyah. You were right.
Is it too late to cancel the interview?

35:33.331 --> 35:36.667
I'm sure I can find a way out of it.
You really don't wanna do it now?

35:36.734 --> 35:40.371
No, and I owe you an apology.
I was too harsh before.

35:40.438 --> 35:42.340
- You don't have to apologize.
- No, I do,

35:42.406 --> 35:46.377
'cause even when this place
forces me into survival mode,

35:46.444 --> 35:49.113
I still want to be your mentor,
not a tyrant.

35:49.413 --> 35:51.716
I don't need yes people
or just a publicist.

35:51.782 --> 35:54.385
I want a friend, someone
who's honest with me. That's you.

35:55.086 --> 35:56.187
I appreciate that.

35:56.521 --> 35:58.823
I also decided
no more M.J.-Justin updates.

35:59.357 --> 36:02.293
I get it. What's good for the brand
ain't always good for you.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.494
You read my mind.

36:06.797 --> 36:09.300
Sorry I was so rough
on your boyfriend earlier.

36:12.169 --> 36:13.704
I think he held his own.

36:13.771 --> 36:16.207
Really?
That's not what my peeps are sayin'.

36:31.188 --> 36:32.823
You realize you just proved me right.

36:33.224 --> 36:35.459
What are you talking about?
Orlando did great,

36:35.526 --> 36:37.194
and Dani's trolls stopped trolling.

36:37.795 --> 36:39.397
I don't have to pay for bodyguards.

36:39.463 --> 36:41.299
- It's a win-win all around.
- Not for you.

36:41.732 --> 36:42.900
You created a monster.

36:43.801 --> 36:47.572
Her fans are going nuts
tweeting about how she creamed Orlando.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.942
That doesn't make sense.

36:51.008 --> 36:54.211
Red and blue watch the same debate
and see it two very different ways.

36:55.313 --> 36:56.814
I hate politics.

36:56.881 --> 37:00.284
I warned you, Garrett.
You gave in to the terrorists.

37:03.054 --> 37:05.189
- What should we do?
- Let me handle it.

37:06.257 --> 37:07.692
I can help keep Dani at bay.

37:08.526 --> 37:09.460
How?

37:11.295 --> 37:13.431
A producer never reveals her secrets.

37:14.465 --> 37:15.433
But...

37:16.100 --> 37:19.136
If I pull this off,
I need something from you.

37:21.172 --> 37:23.641
I wanna do
a prime time show with Mary Jane,

37:23.941 --> 37:25.643
one night, in the fall.

37:25.710 --> 37:27.545
But that's a big ask.

37:29.013 --> 37:32.149
You're the guy hand-picked
to run the show before turning 30.

37:32.216 --> 37:34.218
I'm sure you have futures up your sleeve.

37:38.990 --> 37:40.658
Okay, if you contain Dani,

37:41.525 --> 37:43.060
I'll do my best to make it happen.

37:43.828 --> 37:45.096
Great. Thank you.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.068
I can't believe you did it.

37:51.135 --> 37:53.471
- Are you doubting my negotiation skills?
- Never.

37:54.872 --> 37:57.508
Now we can get back
to doing the stories that really matter.

37:57.575 --> 37:59.143
Only with a much wider audience.

38:02.013 --> 38:04.015
The idea of doing this interview

38:04.682 --> 38:08.386
has got me thinking a lot about the past.
But if I'm being brutally honest,

38:09.453 --> 38:12.490
I've tanked every relationship I've had,
and I don't know why.

38:12.990 --> 38:14.392
Mama, that's...

38:16.027 --> 38:17.795
That's a question only you can answer.

38:22.633 --> 38:23.768
Hi, I'm Patrick.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.202
- Hi, Patrick.
- Hi, Patrick.

38:26.337 --> 38:27.605
And I'm a drug addict.

38:30.474 --> 38:33.277
I've been sober one year,
two months, and one week.

38:36.647 --> 38:40.518
But lately, I've been wanting to get high
more than I ever have in a long time.

38:42.586 --> 38:44.288
I was starting to get my life in order,

38:44.355 --> 38:46.857
but I got some bad news
that sent me into a tailspin.

38:47.124 --> 38:51.395
I always felt like an outcast
in my own family, and now I see

38:52.730 --> 38:54.198
there might be a reason for that.

38:55.499 --> 38:57.001
I thought I was lost before.

38:59.036 --> 39:00.004
But now...

39:01.439 --> 39:02.673
I'm so far gone,

39:03.874 --> 39:05.609
I don't know if I'll ever get back.

39:22.860 --> 39:24.128
Hopper, it's 9:30 p.m.

39:24.829 --> 39:27.698
These came for you after you left
so I thought I'd drop 'em by.

39:27.765 --> 39:28.733
Did Aaliyah send them?

39:29.734 --> 39:31.802
No, they're from Justin.

39:36.907 --> 39:38.309
- Careful.
- It's heavy.

39:38.375 --> 39:39.944
- Got it?
- Yeah, thank you.

39:40.010 --> 39:41.212
- Can you close my door?
- Yes.

39:41.278 --> 39:42.213
Thanks.
