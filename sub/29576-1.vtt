return to the icebox *

00:44.812 --> 00:46.347

the worries of the day *

01:10.238 --> 01:13.274
- Hey, you touching
the merchandise,

01:13.274 --> 01:14.908
are you gonna buy something?

01:14.908 --> 01:17.811
- Gino, put these
on my tab, okay?

01:17.811 --> 01:19.580
- Not until you
pay your back bill.

01:20.748 --> 01:21.915
I'll take it in trade.

01:22.783 --> 01:24.552
- Oh, blow me Gino, come on.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.122
- Hello, how are you?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.126
- Hi.

01:32.126 --> 01:33.394
- Would you like anything else?

01:33.394 --> 01:34.828
- Yes, the usual, please.

01:37.231 --> 01:38.699
- You're here every day.

01:38.699 --> 01:41.068
Why don't you buy a big
bottle and save some money?

01:41.068 --> 01:43.271
- Because I like
that size, Gino.

01:51.945 --> 01:54.615
- Here, a little gift from me.

01:55.816 --> 01:56.850
- Oh, thank you.

02:01.155 --> 02:02.390
- Have a great day.

02:02.390 --> 02:04.057
- Thanks, you too.

02:04.057 --> 02:05.593
- Hey, and you,
what are you doing?

02:05.593 --> 02:07.295
- This is the best part.

02:07.295 --> 02:08.895
- Would you pack up this stuff?

02:08.895 --> 02:10.330
- There's like, nobody in here.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.900
- If I wasn't banging your
mother, you'd be so outta here.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.237
- I heard that yesterday.

* The story never starts
until you break your heart *

03:46.560 --> 03:48.729

nothing kills my pain *

04:01.975 --> 04:06.814
* And I know there's
no one else to blame *

(sighing)

04:58.231 --> 04:59.232
Okay, purse.

05:00.167 --> 05:01.769
Just let me grab it.

05:07.875 --> 05:08.709

05:08.709 --> 05:10.911

coming at your feet *

05:24.558 --> 05:27.861
* And you're holding
everybody that you meet *

05:27.861 --> 05:29.597
* You know you better change

05:29.597 --> 05:32.165
* Change to something
better, something better *

05:32.165 --> 05:35.569
* Yeah, something
better there within *

05:35.569 --> 05:38.839
* You know you better change,
change to something better *

05:38.839 --> 05:40.774
* Something better,
something better *

05:40.774 --> 05:44.645
* Yeah, something better here

05:44.645 --> 05:49.650
* There's something
better here within *

05:54.388 --> 05:55.589
- Oh!
- How you doing?

05:55.589 --> 05:57.858
- Shit.
- Did I scare ya?

05:57.858 --> 05:59.026
- Yeah. (laughs)

05:59.026 --> 06:00.394
- No need to hide the alcohol.

06:00.394 --> 06:01.395
- What do you?

06:01.395 --> 06:02.896
Oh wow.

06:02.896 --> 06:04.465
- Do me a favor, do you
want to shut the car off?

06:04.465 --> 06:05.332
- Officer.
- Ma'am.

06:05.332 --> 06:06.166
- Yes, sir.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.167
- Did you hear me?

06:07.167 --> 06:08.101
You wanna shut the car off?

06:08.101 --> 06:09.369
- Would you like my license?

06:09.369 --> 06:10.003
- I'd like you to shut
the car off right now.

06:10.003 --> 06:11.204
- Okay.

06:11.204 --> 06:11.872
- Take the keys out
of the ignition.

06:11.872 --> 06:12.806
- Shit, um, yes.

06:12.806 --> 06:14.374
- Put the keys on the dash.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.414
- Thank you, license
and registration.

06:23.851 --> 06:25.385
- There you go.

06:25.385 --> 06:26.887
There you go, sir.

06:28.188 --> 06:31.291
- This is your medical
marijuana license you handed me.

06:31.291 --> 06:32.860
- Really? (laughs nervously)

06:32.860 --> 06:33.694
Huh.
- Yeah.

06:33.694 --> 06:34.895
- Yeah, I've--

06:34.895 --> 06:35.829
- Do you want to
step out of the car?

06:35.829 --> 06:36.830
- I've had a really bad day.

06:36.830 --> 06:38.131
- Huh, really?
- Yeah.

06:38.131 --> 06:40.901
- It's about to get worse.
- Why?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.670
- You can button up
your shirt, I'm gay.

06:45.005 --> 06:46.239
- I wasn't driving.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.575
- Put your hands
behind your back.

06:47.575 --> 06:48.809
- Whoa, dude!

06:48.809 --> 06:50.544
- Put your hands
behind your back.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.445
- Oh, fuck!

06:58.285 --> 06:59.787
Ugh, you can't open the car?

06:59.787 --> 07:01.622
- Yeah, yeah, funny.

07:01.622 --> 07:03.123
Get in.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.057
-  Ah!

07:04.057 --> 07:05.425
- I'm not gonna tell you again.

07:05.425 --> 07:07.060
-  Ow!

07:07.060 --> 07:09.763
- Okay, before we proceed
I've got some announcements.

07:10.898 --> 07:12.365
You know, there's an
old coffee can outside.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.067
It's been there
for a couple years,

07:14.067 --> 07:16.436
that's for your cigarette
butts, smokers, okay?

07:16.436 --> 07:18.205
So please, throw them in there.

07:18.205 --> 07:20.407
There's a Smokers Anonymous
meeting here in the mornings,

07:20.407 --> 07:23.877
and all that temptation for
those sick fuckers, come on.

07:23.877 --> 07:27.280
All right, also Panda Express,

07:27.280 --> 07:29.817
they're kind enough to give us
food for the meeting, right?

07:29.817 --> 07:31.519
You'd think we'd be kind enough

07:31.519 --> 07:34.855
to throw their containers in
the trash and not in the alley.

07:34.855 --> 07:36.890
Also that alley is not a toilet.

07:36.890 --> 07:39.392
(door slams shut)

07:39.392 --> 07:40.594
Come on in, come on in.

07:41.595 --> 07:43.163
You got a seat right there.

07:43.163 --> 07:44.397
- Here's a seat.

07:44.397 --> 07:47.067
- Very good, just grab a seat.

07:47.067 --> 07:49.202
There you go, there you go.

07:49.202 --> 07:51.271
Okay, who wants to
start the shares?

07:51.271 --> 07:54.975
(light guitar music)

07:54.975 --> 07:56.309
- I'm Larry, and I'm alcoholic.

07:56.309 --> 07:57.911
- Hi Larry.
- Hey Larry.

07:59.680 --> 08:01.615
- People say the
stupidest shit at work,

08:01.615 --> 08:03.283
and I get so frustrated,

08:03.283 --> 08:07.120
like I blurt out
these inappropriate
remarks and it's...

08:07.120 --> 08:08.522
It's like I have Tourette's.

08:09.923 --> 08:11.625
- I finally decided to
makes amends with my wife.

08:11.625 --> 08:14.828
- The truth is, my wife left
me 'cause I was an alcoholic.

08:16.196 --> 08:18.131
- Shit, I don't even
know where to start, man.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.802
(sighs)

08:22.936 --> 08:26.306
So much blow and
hookers. (chuckles)

08:26.306 --> 08:27.841
Look man, fuck this, man.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.342
Look, look, look, when
she finds out about this,

08:29.342 --> 08:31.344
she's just gonna divorce
me and use it against me.

08:31.344 --> 08:32.379
Man, forget it.

08:32.379 --> 08:34.514
I'm done, forget this.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.152
- My name's John,
I'm an alcoholic.

08:39.152 --> 08:40.419
-  Hi, John.

08:41.488 --> 08:44.191
- And I had a great day today.

08:44.191 --> 08:46.493
I woke up, I didn't come to,

08:46.493 --> 08:49.062
I didn't have to wonder
where my car was.

08:49.062 --> 08:50.864
Like some, I don't
have a car right now,

08:50.864 --> 08:54.334
but that's, I did my little
morning spiritual thing,

08:54.334 --> 08:55.703
you know, and then I meditated.

08:55.703 --> 08:56.904
- Meditate?

08:56.904 --> 08:58.105
You don't meditate,
that's bullshit.

08:58.105 --> 09:00.674
- Yeah, right.
(group chattering)

09:00.674 --> 09:01.474
- Please.

09:02.375 --> 09:03.210
- Thank you.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.780
And, I mean, it's a
beautiful day, right?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.481
And there's a beautiful
swell in the water.

09:08.481 --> 09:12.119
I got some really nice waves,
and I got a new student.

09:12.119 --> 09:15.355
A new client that feels
good, it's a rich kid,

09:15.355 --> 09:19.960
and sometimes when I sense
a little disrespect from

09:19.960 --> 09:21.662
like, a rich, entitled kid,

09:21.662 --> 09:26.634
it's like they have
this condensation
attitude towards me.

09:28.001 --> 09:29.870
Just like, I let the
ocean just kick their ass,

09:29.870 --> 09:32.205
and I enjoy it, and
that's probably bad,

09:32.205 --> 09:35.075
and I should do some
inventory work on that, but,

09:35.075 --> 09:38.111
but I had this revelation
that surfing and life,

09:38.111 --> 09:39.312
they're not that
different really.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.648
I mean, some days.
- Okay, okay.

09:40.648 --> 09:42.149
- I'll wrap it up,
so anyway, I just,

09:42.149 --> 09:44.284
I loved, I loved
being alive today,

09:44.284 --> 09:46.987
and I love AA and thanks
for calling on me.

09:46.987 --> 09:48.689
- You say the same
shit every week, bro.

09:48.689 --> 09:49.957
- That's my life, man.

09:49.957 --> 09:51.725
- Very good, John, thank you.

09:51.725 --> 09:53.627
New girl, would
you like to share?

09:55.262 --> 09:56.229
- Uh, hi.

09:57.330 --> 09:58.165
Uh...

09:59.432 --> 10:00.267
I'm Jane.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.703
-  Hi, Jane.

10:02.703 --> 10:07.540
- I got a DUI, so the
courts made me come here.

10:08.976 --> 10:10.911
- So Jane, do you think
you might be an alcoholic?

10:12.512 --> 10:14.381
- No, I think I'm lonely,

10:16.083 --> 10:18.919
but I don't know if
I'm an alcoholic.

10:18.919 --> 10:22.122
- Well, if you have to think
about it, you probably are.

10:22.122 --> 10:24.424
You know, normal people
don't end up here,

10:24.424 --> 10:25.625
but if you're not an alcoholic,

10:25.625 --> 10:27.127
I'm afraid you
can't share today.

10:28.028 --> 10:30.363
- No, that's, that's okay.

10:30.363 --> 10:32.565
I didn't really have
anything to say anyway.

10:35.302 --> 10:37.905
-  The courage to
change the things I can,

10:37.905 --> 10:41.341
and the wisdom to know
the difference, amen.

10:41.341 --> 10:43.243
-  There you go.

10:43.243 --> 10:44.077
- Jane?

10:44.077 --> 10:45.478
Uh, Rose.

10:45.478 --> 10:46.747
- Hey, how's my hair look?

10:46.747 --> 10:48.381
- It looks like
shit, who cut it?

10:48.381 --> 10:49.616
- I did.

10:49.616 --> 10:50.450
- You look like
one of The Monkees.

10:50.450 --> 10:51.284
(laughing)

10:51.284 --> 10:52.552
- Oh my god.

10:52.552 --> 10:56.656
- This form tells you
if you're an alcoholic.

10:57.624 --> 11:00.427
- Great, thanks.

11:00.427 --> 11:02.095
- You only need to
get three right.

11:03.764 --> 11:05.766
- That's my dream
girl, my dream girl.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.634
- Asshole, that's
everybody's dream girl.

11:07.634 --> 11:10.503
And besides, she's way
above your pay grade.

11:10.503 --> 11:12.005
-  Yeah, you can't
afford a girl like that.

11:13.473 --> 11:15.042
- Don't fuck with my hair.

11:17.911 --> 11:19.279
Hey, you want me to
rub that out for you?

11:19.279 --> 11:20.613
I'm a pretty good masseuse.

11:21.782 --> 11:23.050
- Masseur.

11:23.050 --> 11:27.120
Masseuse is feminine,
masseur is masculine.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.688
- Masseur, masseur.

11:29.957 --> 11:30.791
How's that feel?

11:32.425 --> 11:33.493
- Um, pretty good.

11:35.395 --> 11:39.366
- Jesus, your whole
back is so tight.

11:41.001 --> 11:44.838
- Yeah, well, I'm a little
stressed out at work.

11:44.838 --> 11:46.406
-  I'll say.

11:46.406 --> 11:49.309
- Oh lord, he's not
gonna go there is he?

11:49.309 --> 11:50.143
- What do you do?

11:50.143 --> 11:51.411
Are you a model?

11:51.411 --> 11:52.813
- Apparently he's
making the attempt.

11:52.813 --> 11:55.248
- Listen, did you
get her number?

11:55.248 --> 11:56.683
- I'm not gonna give it to you.

11:56.683 --> 11:57.951
- What?

11:57.951 --> 11:59.186
- I always wanted to
learn how to surf.

11:59.186 --> 12:00.420
- Oh, it's so easy.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.588
I could give you
a lesson sometime.

12:01.588 --> 12:02.790
-  Really?

12:02.790 --> 12:04.024
- Yeah, I'll let
you guys talk, okay?

12:04.024 --> 12:06.159
Hey, it was nice
to meet you, Jane.

12:07.260 --> 12:08.095
- Thanks.

12:10.630 --> 12:12.432
- I can't believe
you got to touch her.

12:12.432 --> 12:14.301
- Yeah, I can't believe
it either, poor girl.

12:14.301 --> 12:15.869
- I deserve a girl like that.

12:15.869 --> 12:17.637
- Please, please, you
don't deserve shit.

12:17.637 --> 12:20.240
- Yeah, you don't deserve shit.

12:21.508 --> 12:24.077
* Simple man

12:24.077 --> 12:27.580
* What dirty hands I have

12:28.648 --> 12:31.184
(Jane sighs)

12:31.184 --> 12:34.087
(light rock music)

12:42.362 --> 12:44.697
- Hmm, are you an alcoholic?

12:46.166 --> 12:50.403
Is drinking make your
whole life unhappy?

12:50.403 --> 12:53.173
I don't have a whole life.

12:55.508 --> 12:57.444
Do you drink alone?

12:57.444 --> 12:59.346
(laughs)

12:59.346 --> 13:00.713
Have you ever had a blackout?

13:01.882 --> 13:03.383
Well, isn't that
just called sleep?

13:06.153 --> 13:08.989
Do you miss time from
work due to drinking?

13:10.157 --> 13:11.925
Very interesting.

13:11.925 --> 13:13.827
Do you want to drink
the next morning?

13:16.763 --> 13:17.597
Yeah.

13:25.338 --> 13:26.907
Hey Adam, it's me.

13:28.441 --> 13:30.810
You should call me.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.246
Call me, call me, call me, bye.

13:37.350 --> 13:40.787
(cellphone ringing)

13:40.787 --> 13:42.155
Hi, Adam?

13:43.323 --> 13:46.493
- No, it's Rose
from the meeting.

13:46.493 --> 13:47.727
Who's Adam?

13:47.727 --> 13:49.529
- Oh, hi, sorry.

13:49.529 --> 13:54.534
He's just some guy who's
never around when I need him.

13:55.302 --> 13:56.736
- Why don't I come over?

13:56.736 --> 13:57.770
We can hang out.

13:57.770 --> 13:59.739
We can play cards.

13:59.739 --> 14:00.908
- Play cards, huh?

14:00.908 --> 14:02.609
-  Backgammon,
watch a movie.

14:04.411 --> 14:07.180
- Okay, yeah, you can come over,

14:07.180 --> 14:09.016
but you gotta bring
some vodka, okay?

14:10.783 --> 14:11.952
- What's your address?

14:11.952 --> 14:13.420
- I'll text you.

14:13.420 --> 14:14.087
-  Why don't you just
tell me your address right now?

14:14.087 --> 14:14.687
- I'll text you.

14:16.089 --> 14:17.891
* I don't wanna feel
like a loser anymore *

14:17.891 --> 14:22.896
* And I don't think that
I can take another 24 *

14:29.036 --> 14:30.503
(coughing)

14:30.503 --> 14:33.240
- Dude, the hottest chick
came into the meeting tonight.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.808
It's like she doesn't
know how hot she is.

14:35.808 --> 14:37.710
She must be from the
Midwest or something.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.347
- I knew you only went to those
meetings to pick up chicks.

14:40.347 --> 14:43.383
Sign me up for the
next one, bro. (laughs)

14:43.383 --> 14:45.118
- Do you have to drink beer

14:45.118 --> 14:47.654
right in front of
me in our room?

14:47.654 --> 14:49.622
- What's the difference
between beer and weed, Cheech?

14:49.622 --> 14:51.358
- I'm not drinking
beer right now.

14:51.358 --> 14:53.026
- All right, chill out, man.

14:53.026 --> 14:57.197
Look, spark this up,
take a hit, cool out.

15:01.301 --> 15:04.137
What step is that
in your program?

15:04.137 --> 15:05.705
- It's called
Marijuana Maintenance.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.107
It's got a name.

15:07.107 --> 15:08.108
It's like, I'm on the
Marijuana Maintenance program.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.876
- That's a good name,

15:09.876 --> 15:11.578
that actually would
be a good band name,

15:11.578 --> 15:12.679
Marijuana Maintenance.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.081
- Marijuana Maintenance.
- Yeah, right?

15:14.081 --> 15:15.682
- I wanna be on the
Marijuana Maintenance team.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.050
- I'm not alone, there's a lot
of people on like the pill,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.351
the Vicodin program, you know?

15:18.351 --> 15:20.587
Like if they don't
drink, they do Vicodin.

15:20.587 --> 15:21.621
- And it's cool?

15:21.621 --> 15:22.855
- No, it's not cool.
- No?

15:22.855 --> 15:24.457
- Don't tell anybody
I'm smoking weed.

15:24.457 --> 15:25.692
I don't tell any people.

15:25.692 --> 15:27.360
I don't, like, "Hey,
I'm smoking weed."

15:27.360 --> 15:28.561
But there's a name for
it, Marijuana Maintenance.

15:28.561 --> 15:30.430
- I tell everyone
that I'm smoking weed.

15:33.666 --> 15:35.935
(wave crashing)

15:35.935 --> 15:38.705
(water bubbling)

15:42.309 --> 15:44.711
* I know that people talk

15:44.711 --> 15:48.415
* Some tell me what they say

15:48.415 --> 15:53.420
* It used to get to me, but
I won't change my ways *

15:53.420 --> 15:58.425
* As time goes by,
I will never lie *

15:59.326 --> 16:03.063
* I don't care if anyone knows

16:04.964 --> 16:07.500
-  Suicide
Hotline, hello?

16:07.500 --> 16:08.335
- Hi.

16:08.335 --> 16:09.936
- Hi.

16:09.936 --> 16:10.803
Hi, who's this?

16:12.772 --> 16:13.973
- Jane.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.042
- Jane, okay.

16:15.042 --> 16:16.576
Jane, what are you doing, Jane?

16:17.744 --> 16:19.146
- What am I doing,
or what do I do?

16:19.146 --> 16:20.980
- What do you do, Jane?

16:22.049 --> 16:25.852
- I'm a legal assistant.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.589
- Okay, so why'd you
call Suicide Hotline?

16:29.589 --> 16:31.058
You okay?

16:31.058 --> 16:32.559
- Well, that's an
interesting question.

16:32.559 --> 16:36.196
I mean, what kind of responses
do you get to that question?

16:36.196 --> 16:37.430
- Bitch.

16:37.430 --> 16:39.266
Well, it's what I'm
told to ask, Jane.

16:39.266 --> 16:41.501
I just wanna know,
and plus, I do care.

16:41.501 --> 16:42.869
That's why I do
this fucking job.

16:42.869 --> 16:44.937
I do it 'cause I
care about people.

16:44.937 --> 16:45.972
(phone ringing)

16:45.972 --> 16:47.174
- Can you hold, please?

16:47.174 --> 16:48.075
- Wait, hey Jane!

16:50.043 --> 16:51.611
- Hi, Tate and Associate.

16:51.611 --> 16:53.246
- Fuck, I hate this fucking job.

16:53.246 --> 16:54.581
This shit sucks.

16:56.216 --> 16:59.219
Hold this call all
the fucking time.

17:00.653 --> 17:02.789
- I'm sorry about that, I
had to take a work call.

17:03.790 --> 17:05.992
- Yeah, well, you're working.

17:05.992 --> 17:07.194
Most people are
looking for jobs.

17:07.194 --> 17:08.694
It's good you got a job, Jane.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.098
- I don't want to be here.

17:12.098 --> 17:13.031
- Well, then go take a break.

17:13.031 --> 17:14.300
Take a lunch break.

17:14.300 --> 17:16.569
- No, no, I don't
want to be here.

17:18.003 --> 17:21.241
- Well shit, I mean, how
can I help you with that?

17:22.375 --> 17:25.178
You sound a little
drowsy, are you okay?

17:25.178 --> 17:28.214
I mean, are you drinking
or something, Jane?

17:28.214 --> 17:29.282
(Jane laughs)

17:29.282 --> 17:31.584
- Yeah, yep.

17:31.584 --> 17:35.922
- Okay well, so
that's all right.

17:35.922 --> 17:37.657
- Oh, this is stupid.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.491
(cellphone ringing
with rap ringtone)

17:38.491 --> 17:39.626
- Oh fuck, Jane.

17:43.430 --> 17:44.364
Yeah, I'm sorry.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.065
I have a life too, Jane.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.967
I'm sorry, excuse me.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.169
- I gotta go.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.837
- No Jane, don't hang
up, don't hang up!

17:51.938 --> 17:54.107
(Jane sighs)

17:54.107 --> 17:56.008
Bitch, fucking.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.612
(coughing)

18:00.847 --> 18:01.814
- Hey, John?

18:04.050 --> 18:05.118
What are you doing?

18:05.118 --> 18:06.353
-  Nothing.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.887
- Bullshit, I just
saw you smoking.

18:07.887 --> 18:08.821
Why are you denying it?

18:08.821 --> 18:09.656
- What are you doing, man?

18:09.656 --> 18:10.490
Why aren't you at work?

18:10.490 --> 18:11.691
- I'm on my lunch break.

18:11.691 --> 18:12.959
If you had a job, you'd
know what that was.

18:12.959 --> 18:14.361
You know he's trying
to get sober, right?

18:14.361 --> 18:15.595
- Yeah, so?

18:15.595 --> 18:16.496
Why are you barging
in my mom's house,

18:16.496 --> 18:18.131
harshing my buzz, bro?

18:18.131 --> 18:18.965
- Good friend.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.367
- He is a good friend.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.768
- Yeah, I don't see you
letting him live at your house.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.203
- He has.
- Not now.

18:25.672 --> 18:27.540
- You've been
taking dirty chips.

18:27.540 --> 18:28.708
- No, that's I've--

18:28.708 --> 18:29.409
- You've been
taking dirty chips.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.643
You're lying.

18:30.643 --> 18:31.911
You're lying, I
know you're lying!

18:31.911 --> 18:32.845
You're lying, you're
taking dirty chips!

18:32.845 --> 18:34.314
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, hey bro.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.248
You're getting a little too
"Sex and the City" for my taste,

18:35.248 --> 18:36.716
and not even the good one,

18:36.716 --> 18:38.318
it's like the sequel where
they go to Zimbabwe and shit.

18:38.318 --> 18:41.821
Hey man, if you need it, and
Carrie, take care of Samantha.

18:41.821 --> 18:42.922
You know how she gets.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.161
- Don't look at
me like that, man.

18:48.161 --> 18:51.331
If you had my life,
you'd kill yourself.

18:52.765 --> 18:53.566
- Just listen, John, you
can do whatever you want.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.067
I'm not gonna judge you.

18:55.067 --> 18:58.070
I'm still your friend, but you
know the path it goes down.

18:58.938 --> 19:00.240
It's smoking, drinking, coke.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.274
- Relax, okay.

19:01.274 --> 19:02.775
It's just a hit of pot.

19:02.775 --> 19:03.910
It's not gonna kill me.

19:05.044 --> 19:06.446
- Listen man, I'm there for you.

19:06.446 --> 19:07.514
Will you please
come to a meeting?

19:07.514 --> 19:08.515
- I am coming, I'll come.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.716
I am coming to the meeting.

19:09.716 --> 19:10.917
- Look at me, promise?
- Yeah, I promise.

19:10.917 --> 19:11.851
I promise!

19:11.851 --> 19:12.785
Give me some water will ya?

19:12.785 --> 19:14.487
You got a sippy cup in there?

19:14.487 --> 19:16.289
- I do not know why
I'm your friend.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.826
- Don't help me, man.

19:19.826 --> 19:20.927
I'm not taking a
newcomer chip, all right?

19:20.927 --> 19:23.863
I don't want judgmental
Billy's eyes,

19:23.863 --> 19:25.732
like, trying to shame me.

19:25.732 --> 19:28.100
I just want to see
if Jane comes back.

19:28.100 --> 19:28.935
- Jane, why?

19:28.935 --> 19:30.403
- Why?

19:30.403 --> 19:33.072
'Cause, fuck, I mean, she's
the hottest chick in the world.

19:33.072 --> 19:35.174
She's beautiful and I had a
dream about her last night.

19:35.174 --> 19:37.210
- Yeah, I creamed
about her last night.

19:37.210 --> 19:39.212
- Hey, respect my girl, man.

19:39.212 --> 19:40.813
-  You think you
got a shot with her?

19:40.813 --> 19:42.282
- I know I do.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.750
- I bet you all the money
you owe me you can't.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.852
- You'll bet me all the money
I owe you I can't get her.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.387
-  I will bet you
all the money you owe me,

19:47.387 --> 19:49.088
you can't get her.

19:49.088 --> 19:50.990
- Define get her?

19:50.990 --> 19:54.461
- The 13th step,
and all rules apply.

19:54.461 --> 19:55.695
But don't act like a baby.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.163
Last time Larry and I
destroyed you with Anna,

19:57.163 --> 19:59.065
now Anna's all on your
shit, and Anna all in you,

19:59.065 --> 20:00.833
and now she hates you and
you complain to Larry and I.

20:00.833 --> 20:03.169
- Anna, don't, Anna's
fucking nuts, right?

20:03.169 --> 20:04.437
Anna does not count.

20:04.437 --> 20:06.273
Anna, no Anna.

20:06.273 --> 20:07.173
This is Jane.

20:09.175 --> 20:11.210
Bet.
- Bet.

20:11.210 --> 20:12.612
Money in the bank.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.517
- You haven't
called me in awhile.

20:17.517 --> 20:19.151
You know, if you want
me to be your sponsor,

20:19.151 --> 20:21.153
I said you had to
check in occasionally.

20:22.322 --> 20:24.257
So, what's going on with you?

20:24.257 --> 20:25.224
- Nothing, I'm good.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.726
- Really?
- Yeah.

20:26.726 --> 20:27.894
- Really, you can't even
look me in the eye, buddy.

20:27.894 --> 20:31.298
What's happening, huh?

20:31.298 --> 20:32.999
I'm serious about this,
if I don't hear from you,

20:32.999 --> 20:34.634
I'm gonna assume you're
not taking it seriously,

20:34.634 --> 20:36.068
you don't need me
as a sponsor, okay?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.137
'Cause I don't want
to sponsor people

20:38.137 --> 20:40.273
who don't take the
program seriously, right?

20:40.273 --> 20:41.308
You got it?
- Okay.

20:41.308 --> 20:42.609
- You got it?

20:42.609 --> 20:44.944
- I'm gonna miss you,
but I'm in the cards.

20:46.779 --> 20:49.148
- They're all assholes, eh?

20:49.148 --> 20:51.784
All right, meeting
time everybody.

20:51.784 --> 20:53.219
I only have one announcement.

20:54.621 --> 20:57.890
Somebody had their dog
shit in the neighbor's yard

20:57.890 --> 20:59.091
and did not clean it up,

20:59.091 --> 21:01.361
and I got in big
trouble because of it.

21:01.361 --> 21:05.131
So, let's not do
that anymore, okay?

21:05.131 --> 21:06.333
I mean, who has the audacity

21:06.333 --> 21:08.868
to not clean up their
dog's shit, right?

21:08.868 --> 21:10.503
If we don't clean
up our dog's shit,

21:10.503 --> 21:12.605
the world's gonna be
covered with dog shit.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.774
- That's the type of shit
I'm always complaining about.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.209
- Right, it's like a
metaphor, but it's...

21:17.209 --> 21:19.111
And by the way, I'm
assuming it was dog shit.

21:19.111 --> 21:22.315
Knowing you guys, who knows?

21:22.315 --> 21:24.451
Anyway, subject of
tonight's meeting,

21:24.451 --> 21:27.053
surrendering to
your higher power.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.622
- Look who decided to
grace us with her presence.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.424
- At least I made it.

21:31.424 --> 21:34.160
- Ugh, so superior.
- What?

21:36.996 --> 21:39.332
- All right, who'd like
to start the shares

21:39.332 --> 21:41.033
on tonight's subject?

21:41.968 --> 21:43.202
Who wants to share next

21:43.202 --> 21:45.271
that was not super
late for the meeting?

21:45.271 --> 21:47.039
- I had a good reason.

21:47.039 --> 21:48.575
- What, were you getting stoned?

21:48.575 --> 21:50.710
- No, but I'm sure you'd
like to burn one with me.

21:50.710 --> 21:51.978
- Respect the meeting.

21:51.978 --> 21:53.112
- Well, she started it.

21:54.347 --> 21:55.648
- Who wants to share?

21:55.648 --> 21:59.786
- I've seen a lot of
people like you, Roxy,

21:59.786 --> 22:01.388
and that's why I'm upset.

22:01.388 --> 22:04.757
I'm upset for you because I
feel like if you don't clean up,

22:04.757 --> 22:09.762
I'm gonna see you and then
you're gonna be in the hospital,

22:10.930 --> 22:12.365
and you'll be in jail,
and then you'll be dead,

22:12.365 --> 22:15.902
and I, I'm just scared
for you, that's why.

22:15.902 --> 22:18.938
I'm resentful and afraid.

22:18.938 --> 22:22.274
- Well, if you'd let me share,
maybe I won't kill myself.

22:22.274 --> 22:25.044
- Oh my god!
- Come on, really?

22:25.044 --> 22:26.646
- Rose, don't jump into this.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.314
How do you know it's
drama and not real?

22:28.314 --> 22:32.619
- All right ladies, Roxy,
would you please share.

22:32.619 --> 22:33.553
- I would like to share.

22:33.553 --> 22:34.587
- Okay, please do.

22:34.587 --> 22:36.122
- I mean, come on, man.

22:36.122 --> 22:38.991
I thought we were supposed to
be able to be vulnerable here.

22:38.991 --> 22:41.994
I can relate to you,
and you, and you,

22:41.994 --> 22:44.931
and you, and you, and
you, and you, and you.

22:44.931 --> 22:46.065
What you just said,

22:47.634 --> 22:49.368
I feel it.

22:49.368 --> 22:50.637
Now listen, man,

22:50.637 --> 22:52.839
my mom died like about
a month and a half ago.

22:52.839 --> 22:56.108
You guys don't know that because
you don't know me at all,

22:56.108 --> 22:57.944
but I was very close to her,

22:59.345 --> 23:03.115
and since then I've been really
spiraling out of control,

23:03.115 --> 23:06.285
and I'm scared and I don't
know what to fucking do.

23:06.285 --> 23:10.156
I don't want to end up alone
like my mother with nothing,

23:10.156 --> 23:12.592
except my guitar, and that's it.

23:12.592 --> 23:14.894
You know, my guitar's
my best friend.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.295
I mean, how lame is that?

23:16.295 --> 23:17.597
I mean, come on, man.

23:18.565 --> 23:19.966
I'm done, I'm done sharing.

23:19.966 --> 23:22.669
Share away. (sighs)

23:24.336 --> 23:25.672
-  Okay, thank you, Roxy.

23:25.672 --> 23:27.073
Thank you.

23:27.073 --> 23:30.342
Um, Deen, what's going on today?

23:31.778 --> 23:34.346
-  To accept the
things I cannot change,

23:34.346 --> 23:36.783
the courage to change
the things I can,

23:36.783 --> 23:39.151
and the wisdom to
know the difference.

23:39.151 --> 23:41.821
(phone buzzing)

23:43.289 --> 23:44.356
- So I can call you?

23:45.458 --> 23:48.194
I mean, I will call you.
- Yes, yes, John.

23:48.194 --> 23:49.596
- I will call you.

23:49.596 --> 23:51.531
- You can call me.
- Okay thanks, goodnight.

23:59.271 --> 24:00.740
- Bro, I'm trying to eat here.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.010
- I have a hot chick's
phone number in my phone.

24:04.010 --> 24:05.512
She gave me her number,
she put it in my phone,

24:05.512 --> 24:07.013
and she said I could call her.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.081
I should call her.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.583
She's probably
just sitting around

24:10.583 --> 24:11.784
waiting for me to call her.
- Dude, just call her already!

24:11.784 --> 24:12.952
It's been like, three
days of this shit.

24:12.952 --> 24:14.120
You're like an
eight year old girl

24:14.120 --> 24:15.688
trapped in my
grandfather's body.

24:15.688 --> 24:17.857
- You don't know what
it's like to be my age.

24:17.857 --> 24:19.091
- I don't.

24:19.091 --> 24:20.326
- But I know what it's
like to be your age,

24:20.326 --> 24:21.594
'cause I've been there.
- True.

24:21.594 --> 24:22.829
- These kids these days are,

24:22.829 --> 24:24.564
all you ever do are
you're looking at,

24:24.564 --> 24:25.865
it's all porn for you.

24:25.865 --> 24:26.699
- Yeah.

24:28.200 --> 24:29.435
- Maybe she's calling me.

24:31.938 --> 24:32.939
Nope.

24:32.939 --> 24:35.975
(light guitar music)

24:35.975 --> 24:37.376
- I will, yes.

24:37.376 --> 24:38.377
I will tell him right away.

24:38.377 --> 24:39.211
(phone ringing)

24:39.211 --> 24:40.279
Best to you.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.315
(phone ringing)

24:43.315 --> 24:44.651
Hello?

24:44.651 --> 24:47.687
- Jane, it's John
from the meeting.

24:47.687 --> 24:50.022
- Oh, hi.
- Hey.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.359
What are you doing?

24:53.359 --> 24:54.794
- I am working.

24:54.794 --> 24:55.728
- Ooh, sorry.

24:55.728 --> 24:57.429
I was just calling just to see

24:57.429 --> 25:00.967
if you wanted to watch
that movie with me tonight.

25:00.967 --> 25:02.869
- Uh, yeah, sure.

25:02.869 --> 25:04.904
Fine, I don't have any plans.

25:04.904 --> 25:07.273
- Great, what's your address?

25:07.273 --> 25:09.909
-  Why are we
going to my place?

25:09.909 --> 25:12.478
- Oh well, I mean,
I, I have a roommate.

25:12.478 --> 25:14.280
I share a room with a roommate.

25:14.280 --> 25:15.514
-  You share a room?

25:15.514 --> 25:18.885
- It's, um, he's
my surfing buddy,

25:18.885 --> 25:20.720
and we share a beach
house, you know?

25:20.720 --> 25:21.954
It's like--

25:21.954 --> 25:23.756
- Fine, I'll text
you my address.

25:23.756 --> 25:25.558
- Yes, cool, great!

25:25.558 --> 25:27.159
I'll bring popcorn.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.294
-  Wait, wait, wait, wait.

25:28.294 --> 25:29.228
Um, we're just watching
a movie, right?

25:29.228 --> 25:30.229
- Oh no, yeah, no.

25:30.229 --> 25:32.031
I know, I'm not,
I don't do that.

25:32.031 --> 25:33.399
I can't do that, I mean,
I don't even know you,

25:33.399 --> 25:34.867
but we should just get
to know each other.

25:34.867 --> 25:36.803
Like maybe I'll massage
your neck or something.

25:36.803 --> 25:38.571
Okay, I'll see you at eight.

25:39.405 --> 25:42.675
(energetic rock music)

25:48.080 --> 25:50.750
(bong bubbling)

25:54.553 --> 25:56.255
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane.

25:56.255 --> 25:57.690
Jane, Jane, Jane,
Jane, Jane, Jane.

25:57.690 --> 25:58.625
How's my hair?

25:58.625 --> 25:59.525
- Solid.

25:59.525 --> 26:00.927
- Nose hairs?
- Check.

26:00.927 --> 26:03.062
- Tongue flash?
- Check.

26:03.062 --> 26:03.963
- How's my hair look?

26:03.963 --> 26:05.197
- Still solid, bro.

26:05.197 --> 26:06.465
You could be like a
Solid Gold dancer.

26:06.465 --> 26:08.400
- Exactly.
- Flex your pecs for me.

26:08.400 --> 26:09.902
You can't wear that shirt,
you wore it yesterday.

26:09.902 --> 26:11.871
It smells like wet
dog and low tide.

26:11.871 --> 26:13.640
- Oh, good call,
good catch, man.

26:14.974 --> 26:18.510
(energetic rock music)

26:18.510 --> 26:20.512
(sighs)

26:22.214 --> 26:23.382
-  Solid.

26:23.382 --> 26:24.851
- Bag?
- Check.

26:24.851 --> 26:26.485
- Movie?
- Check.

26:26.485 --> 26:27.286
- See ya.

26:27.286 --> 26:28.454
- You're all set.

26:28.454 --> 26:30.522
You're like an Eagle Scout.

26:30.522 --> 26:32.625
* The dance on stars
and fly on vibes *

26:32.625 --> 26:35.728
* And scream on trains

26:35.728 --> 26:38.564
(sniffing)

26:38.564 --> 26:40.833
(coughing)

26:43.836 --> 26:45.371
-  Hi.

26:45.371 --> 26:46.873
- I brought porn.

26:46.873 --> 26:49.408
Corn, I brought the movie and
some popcorn and some soda.

26:50.609 --> 26:53.145
- Great, um, please come in.

26:53.145 --> 26:54.313
-  Okay.

27:00.619 --> 27:03.089
- You can, you can have
a seat if you want.

27:08.861 --> 27:13.866
Did you pop this at home or
did you get it from a theater?

27:15.167 --> 27:17.269
- Which would be
the best answer?

27:17.269 --> 27:18.404
- The truth.

27:18.404 --> 27:19.338
(John laughs)

27:19.338 --> 27:20.740
- I get it from a theater.

27:20.740 --> 27:22.909
It's just a day old,
they're gonna throw it away,

27:22.909 --> 27:24.476
and I'm a freegan, so it's free.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.045
- You know, it's okay.

27:26.045 --> 27:28.681
I'm just gonna out
this right here, okay.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.757
Did you seriously

27:37.757 --> 27:41.527
bring an open box of condoms?

27:41.527 --> 27:43.395
- No, that's my roommate
must've put that in the bag, I--

27:43.395 --> 27:44.897
- No, no, no, shh!

27:45.998 --> 27:47.934
What were you
expecting to happen?

27:47.934 --> 27:50.803
- Nothing, I know nothing's
gonna happen here.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.805
Let's just, let's
just eat some porn.

27:52.805 --> 27:54.040
- What?

27:54.040 --> 27:56.108
Just eat some popcorn
and watch the movie.

27:58.444 --> 28:00.046
You have a really
nice apartment.

28:00.046 --> 28:01.580
How long have you lived here?

28:01.580 --> 28:03.049
I mean, there's nothing in here.

28:03.049 --> 28:06.719
- I'm just, I like things
around me to be neat.

28:07.754 --> 28:08.955
I'm OCD.

28:08.955 --> 28:10.256
- Me too.

28:10.256 --> 28:11.557
Wait, what does that mean?

28:12.491 --> 28:14.560
- Obsessive compulsive disorder.

28:14.560 --> 28:15.561
- I know, but what?

28:15.561 --> 28:16.729
I mean, what?

28:16.729 --> 28:17.964
Are you a neat
freak or something?

28:17.964 --> 28:19.131
You like to clean,
that's awesome.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.066
You like to cook?

28:21.167 --> 28:22.802
- I cook.
- Ah, nice.

28:22.802 --> 28:24.336
You want to have kids?

28:24.336 --> 28:26.105
- Stop talking.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.706
Please, sit down.

28:27.706 --> 28:29.075
Just sit down on the couch.

28:30.843 --> 28:33.145
- That's a firm couch.
- Yes it is.

28:34.213 --> 28:35.047
- Hmm.

28:43.589 --> 28:44.390
I'll be good.

28:45.291 --> 28:46.692
- Oh no, no, no.

28:46.692 --> 28:47.960
You're not gonna be good.

28:50.763 --> 28:52.098
(sighs)

28:52.098 --> 28:53.399
- It's good.

28:53.399 --> 28:58.404
* I need someone

28:59.638 --> 29:04.576
* Whoa, I need someone

29:06.045 --> 29:10.316
* I need someone,
someone like you *

29:11.450 --> 29:14.086
Ah jeez, you're
really good at that.

29:14.086 --> 29:16.255
(moaning)

29:18.825 --> 29:19.992
-  Whoa.

29:25.731 --> 29:26.565
- You all right?
- Open your mouth.

29:26.565 --> 29:28.667
Open your mouth.

29:28.667 --> 29:30.837
(moaning)

29:33.372 --> 29:34.706
I can do this all night, baby.

29:34.706 --> 29:35.541
Oh yeah.

29:37.443 --> 29:39.678
(mumbling)

29:44.183 --> 29:45.017
Oh yeah.

29:46.752 --> 29:48.921
(moaning)

29:49.989 --> 29:51.090
- Oh yeah, oh!

29:51.090 --> 29:52.091
Ow!

29:52.091 --> 29:53.459
Yeah!

29:53.459 --> 29:56.195
(moaning)

29:56.195 --> 29:59.798
- Oh my god, I haven't
done this in awhile.

30:01.367 --> 30:02.835
All right.

30:02.835 --> 30:05.504
I'm coming, oh,
I'm fucking coming.

30:05.504 --> 30:07.173
- Oh yeah.
- Oh my god!

30:07.173 --> 30:08.908
Oh, I'm coming!

30:08.908 --> 30:10.977
Oh, I'm coming.
- Yeah.

30:10.977 --> 30:12.044
- Oh my god!

30:12.044 --> 30:13.312
Wow, oh my god.

30:18.684 --> 30:19.518
Oh my god.

30:21.353 --> 30:22.188
- Oh.

30:27.426 --> 30:29.595
(snoring)

30:45.244 --> 30:46.545
- Oh, thank god.

30:56.255 --> 30:58.991
- I'm really not
a morning person.

30:58.991 --> 31:00.592
I've gotta get ready for work.

31:00.592 --> 31:02.561
- I wanna make you
feel good again.

31:02.561 --> 31:03.930
- Oh, I don't want to feel good.

31:03.930 --> 31:06.398
I just want to sleep.

31:06.398 --> 31:07.766
- It's okay, I like that.

31:07.766 --> 31:09.701
You be asleep.

31:09.701 --> 31:12.171
I'll go so quick, you
won't feel a thing.

31:15.774 --> 31:19.011
(energetic rock music)

31:20.479 --> 31:21.981
- Laundry day, sweet.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.549
He shoots he scores.

31:23.549 --> 31:25.684
- If I do your laundry,
it's 100 bucks.

31:27.119 --> 31:28.387
- Dude, you're cleaning like
you got laid or something.

31:28.387 --> 31:29.221
What's up?

31:29.221 --> 31:30.156
- I did!

31:30.156 --> 31:31.890
- Oh shit, that's headline news.

31:31.890 --> 31:32.858
When's the parade?

31:32.858 --> 31:34.226
- It was awful.

31:34.226 --> 31:35.427
He was like a jackhammer
and he was just,

31:37.163 --> 31:42.168
he kept going and going, and
going, and going, and going.

31:43.069 --> 31:43.902
- Oh, that sounds terrible.

31:43.902 --> 31:44.870
Why didn't you stop?

31:44.870 --> 31:46.738
- You can do that?

31:46.738 --> 31:48.107
- I cannot bring her over here.

31:48.107 --> 31:50.242
This is a pig sty,
man, and she's OCD.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.345
- Whoa, this must be some
Superfly Jimmy Snuka pussy

31:53.345 --> 31:54.880
if it got you cleaning
like this. (laughs)

31:54.880 --> 31:57.984
- Yeah, she's the best pussy
I've ever had in my life.

31:57.984 --> 32:00.152
- Boys will be
boys in any circle.

32:00.152 --> 32:02.554
(Jane coughs)

32:03.755 --> 32:07.326
- Wait, does he have a
disease or something?

32:07.326 --> 32:10.396
- No, just, um, well,

32:11.497 --> 32:13.599
John is...

32:13.599 --> 32:14.400
-  What?

32:15.467 --> 32:16.468
- He's a loser.

32:18.004 --> 32:20.906
(moody rock music)

32:23.709 --> 32:25.377
- Hey.
- Hi gorgeous.

32:27.646 --> 32:28.480
The usual?

32:29.348 --> 32:30.716
- Uh, no.

32:30.716 --> 32:33.119
The big one, please.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.854
- Ooh, upgrade.
- Yep.

32:35.854 --> 32:37.456
- There you go.

32:37.456 --> 32:38.390
48, please.

32:52.438 --> 32:55.407
(ice cubs rattling)

33:02.514 --> 33:04.683
(exhales)

33:13.659 --> 33:16.062
- Okay, I've only got
one announcement tonight.

33:16.062 --> 33:17.329
You know why we love

33:17.329 --> 33:18.964
having homeless people
come to this meeting?

33:18.964 --> 33:22.468
I mean, besides the fact
they're inspirational and,

33:22.468 --> 33:25.003
it's because they never
ever park their fucking cars

33:25.003 --> 33:27.373
in front of the
neighbor's driveway, ever.

33:27.373 --> 33:28.607
They never do that.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.009
So please, stop that, okay?

33:31.009 --> 33:32.544
- That's what I'm talking about.

33:32.544 --> 33:33.812
- Oh shoot.

33:33.812 --> 33:35.614
Okay, who wants to
start the shares?

33:36.882 --> 33:38.517
Anna?

33:38.517 --> 33:40.086
- I'm Anna and I'm an alcoholic.

33:40.086 --> 33:41.720
-  Hi Anna.

33:41.720 --> 33:45.457
- I'm seriously starting
to wonder, what matters?

33:45.457 --> 33:47.159
Like I mean, I'm
really spiritual.

33:48.560 --> 33:50.596
I think I just need a new
boyfriend, a real one.

33:50.596 --> 33:52.631
Not some loser,

33:52.631 --> 33:54.433
always after a new piece
of ass, talking about,

33:54.433 --> 33:56.235
"Baby, if I owned the world,
it would be all yours."

33:56.235 --> 33:58.304
But all he ever has
is a pending tab and,

33:58.304 --> 34:01.873
(speaking in foreign language)

34:01.873 --> 34:04.543
Mama didn't raise no fool.

34:04.543 --> 34:05.777
I got my head on right,

34:05.777 --> 34:08.580
and I'm coochie real
tight, thank you.

34:08.580 --> 34:13.051
- Ooh, did she just say
she had a tight coochie?

34:13.051 --> 34:14.219
- Okay, thank you, Anna.

34:14.219 --> 34:14.886
- Thank you, Anna.
- Thank you.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.289
- Hey Anna.
- Hey.

34:18.757 --> 34:19.991
-  Hilda?

34:19.991 --> 34:21.659
- Hi, I'm Hilda,
I'm an alcoholic.

34:21.659 --> 34:23.228
-  Hi Hilda.

34:23.228 --> 34:24.530
- I'm really having a hard time.

34:24.530 --> 34:26.665
You know, I know what I'm doing.

34:27.533 --> 34:30.668
For months now, I have been,

34:30.668 --> 34:34.005
um, hiding vodka in my shower,

34:35.407 --> 34:37.443
in the shampoo bottle.

34:37.443 --> 34:38.909
I take showers like
three times a day.

34:38.909 --> 34:43.081
It's the stupid, I'm the
cleanest alcoholic probably.

34:44.216 --> 34:46.051
I'm so ashamed.

34:47.253 --> 34:50.822
I just couldn't sit
here and not tell you.

34:53.159 --> 34:54.393
That's all.

34:54.393 --> 34:56.362
You're only as sick as
your secrets, right?

34:57.263 --> 34:58.197
Thanks.

34:58.197 --> 34:59.631
- Thanks Hilda.
- Thank you.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.134
- John?

35:03.335 --> 35:04.903
- My name's John,
I'm an alcoholic.

35:04.903 --> 35:06.705
-  Hi John.

35:06.705 --> 35:09.141
- And also as sick
as my secrets.

35:09.141 --> 35:11.076
Thank you for that share.

35:11.076 --> 35:13.312
I've been taking dirty chips.

35:13.312 --> 35:16.848
I've been smoking pot and
I'm just fucking sick of it.

35:16.848 --> 35:18.317
I'm sick of my own bullshit.

35:18.317 --> 35:21.787
I'm just, I'm not, I'm
like a 40 year old child.

35:21.787 --> 35:22.854
- You're still lying.

35:23.722 --> 35:25.391
- I'm like a 42 year old child.

35:25.391 --> 35:26.925
- You're still lying.

35:28.694 --> 35:30.262
- I can't fucking
tell the truth, man.

35:30.262 --> 35:34.366
I'm like, I come to
these meetings, I share,

35:34.366 --> 35:36.001
like I think I'm
trying to be cute

35:36.001 --> 35:37.236
or I'm trying to be
cool or something,

35:37.236 --> 35:40.005
but I'm just a fucking
scared little kid, man.

35:40.005 --> 35:41.173
I'm afraid to grow up.

35:41.173 --> 35:42.508
I'm afraid of the feelings.

35:43.842 --> 35:46.278
My mom gave me everything
I have, you know?

35:46.278 --> 35:49.815
She gave me everything I'll
ever be and I'm ever gonna be.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.683
I just fucking wasted it.

35:55.421 --> 35:59.625
She's not gonna live
to see me do anything.

35:59.625 --> 36:02.994
(crying softly)

36:02.994 --> 36:06.432
And I'm gonna fucking
bury her or something,

36:06.432 --> 36:07.966
burn her fucking shit.

36:07.966 --> 36:12.804
I'm just gonna be a fucking
drunk, a fucking street guy,

36:16.141 --> 36:18.076
but look, you know, fuck!

36:19.545 --> 36:21.847
I just wanna fuckin' take
responsibility for myself.

36:21.847 --> 36:24.250
You guys, I've been
depending on you,

36:24.250 --> 36:25.784
and you guys have
been carrying me,

36:25.784 --> 36:28.220
but I'm gonna take some actions
and be accountable for like,

36:28.220 --> 36:29.921
little simple
things like my time.

36:29.921 --> 36:31.290
I got three days.

36:31.290 --> 36:32.524
I'm three days sober.

36:35.160 --> 36:35.994
-  Thanks, John.

36:38.330 --> 36:41.267
(light rock music)

36:57.182 --> 36:59.651
- I'm fucking
lying to everybody.

36:59.651 --> 37:01.152
I tell everybody I'm
sober, but I'm not.

37:01.152 --> 37:03.655
I fucking leave here and
go get a fifth, you know?

37:06.392 --> 37:08.226
I know it's tough.

37:11.797 --> 37:13.164
- Really?

37:13.164 --> 37:18.169
* Something's gonna happen

37:19.505 --> 37:24.510
* You're staring
off now to the sky *

37:25.411 --> 37:29.080
* We're staring off now

37:29.080 --> 37:32.351
(energetic drum music)

37:51.703 --> 37:53.339
- Fuck Roxy, you scared me.

37:53.339 --> 37:54.940
- Hey dude, can I have
a bite of that, please?

37:54.940 --> 37:56.207
I'm starving, come on.

37:56.207 --> 37:58.209
- You can have it,
have the whole thing.

37:59.210 --> 38:00.946
- You want a roach for it?

38:00.946 --> 38:02.247
- Okay.

38:02.247 --> 38:04.049
Hey, thanks for
never ratting on me.

38:06.718 --> 38:08.286
I don't need this
anymore though, thanks.

38:08.286 --> 38:10.221
You keep it, if you want it.

38:10.221 --> 38:11.857
- Really?
- Yeah.

38:11.857 --> 38:12.858
- All right.

38:12.858 --> 38:13.959
- All right.
- Your loss.

38:13.959 --> 38:14.993
- Have a good day.
- Okay.

38:27.072 --> 38:28.173
- Hey, man.

38:28.173 --> 38:28.974
- Hey, John.

38:29.875 --> 38:30.809
- Hey, you were right, man.

38:30.809 --> 38:32.277
You were right about everything.

38:32.277 --> 38:33.712
I'm not okay.

38:33.712 --> 38:36.615
I'm obsessing about the girl,
I'm obsessing about her.

38:36.615 --> 38:37.983
What should I do?

38:37.983 --> 38:39.250
(Billy sighs)

38:39.250 --> 38:41.387
- Meditate and pray to
remove the obsession.

38:42.688 --> 38:44.623
- Yeah, does that work though?

38:45.791 --> 38:46.658
- John, you know what?

38:46.658 --> 38:48.026
We've been having

38:48.026 --> 38:49.160
this same fucking
conversation for four years.

38:49.160 --> 38:51.129
You sound like a
goddamn 12 year old boy.

38:51.129 --> 38:52.864
- You say the same
thing every time too,

38:52.864 --> 38:54.299
that's all you ever say.

38:54.299 --> 38:56.101
You say the same shit to
me and it doesn't work.

38:56.101 --> 38:57.335
- You're wasting
my fucking time.

38:57.335 --> 38:59.170
There's 50 other guys
that I could be helping.

38:59.170 --> 39:01.339
If you want to be dishonest,
this is bullshit, John!

39:01.339 --> 39:04.543
This is fucking bullshit,
everything you say is bullshit.

39:04.543 --> 39:05.811
I have to play along with it.

39:05.811 --> 39:07.278
If you don't want my help,

39:07.278 --> 39:08.780
if you don't want to be
sober, I don't give a fuck!

39:08.780 --> 39:10.315
If you don't want to
live, I don't give a fuck.

39:10.315 --> 39:12.784
That's your life, but don't
fucking waste my time, John!

39:12.784 --> 39:15.521
- I do it, I'm on
my knees saying it,

39:16.388 --> 39:18.156
and it's like I'm stupid.

39:18.156 --> 39:19.458
It's like math, it's
like hocus, I don't--

39:19.458 --> 39:21.660
- People that actually
fucking listen to me,

39:21.660 --> 39:23.629
and they get better,
but you don't,

39:23.629 --> 39:25.464
and you're just doing the same
goddamn shit over and over,

39:25.464 --> 39:28.534
and the same fucking stupid
questions about pussy.

39:28.534 --> 39:30.001
- But what did you do?

39:30.001 --> 39:31.670
Just tell me what you did,
what do you think I should do?

39:31.670 --> 39:32.971
Just tell me what you
did, I don't care.

39:32.971 --> 39:34.205
Don't tell me what
you think I should do,

39:34.205 --> 39:35.941
just tell me what
you did that worked.

39:35.941 --> 39:39.310
- Meditate and fucking pray
to remove the obsession, John!

39:39.310 --> 39:40.145
Got it?

39:41.680 --> 39:42.514
- Okay.

39:44.349 --> 39:46.585
All right, I get it, thank you.

39:47.486 --> 39:49.988
- Okay, call me later.

40:04.069 --> 40:07.372
(breathing heavily)

40:07.372 --> 40:09.641
(inhaling)

40:11.042 --> 40:11.877
- Hey God,

40:14.646 --> 40:16.414
I want to thank you in advance

40:16.414 --> 40:19.117
for putting Jane in
my life and helping,

40:19.117 --> 40:22.488
helping me get her, and
we can get Jane together.

40:23.889 --> 40:28.560
So, if I do get Jane, I
won't ever smoke weed again,

40:30.361 --> 40:33.064
and I'll try to think of others

40:33.064 --> 40:34.866
instead of just
myself all the time.

40:36.602 --> 40:37.903
I feel better already.

40:40.238 --> 40:41.039
Thank you.

40:44.342 --> 40:49.314
* Oh, my gun is in my hand

40:50.582 --> 40:55.320
* I'll have to make my
stand in the highlands *

40:57.523 --> 41:02.427
* And Lord, it's
getting hard to ride *

41:04.195 --> 41:09.200
* The bullet in my
side took its toll *

41:11.336 --> 41:16.341
* Oh, the sheriff
spoiled my plan *

41:17.576 --> 41:22.347
* To be the richest
man in the highlands *

41:25.150 --> 41:27.318
- Hey Rose, yeah, it's me.

41:30.255 --> 41:35.260
* Now I have to say
goodbye to my girl *

41:37.328 --> 41:39.898
* Oh, oh, oh

41:39.898 --> 41:43.935
* Give me the time to spend

41:43.935 --> 41:48.574
* One more night with
the lover of mine *

41:55.747 --> 41:56.548
- Hey Mom.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.687
- What do you want?

42:01.687 --> 42:02.921
- I just came over to see you.

42:02.921 --> 42:03.755
I miss you.

42:04.756 --> 42:05.624
- Yeah, right.

42:08.093 --> 42:10.495
- It's pretty obvious.

42:10.495 --> 42:11.930
- Anytime you come
over unannounced,

42:11.930 --> 42:13.131
it's always about money.

42:15.166 --> 42:17.869
- I just need 500 bucks
for rent this month.

42:17.869 --> 42:20.305
It's been a really slow month.

42:21.973 --> 42:24.042
- It's always a slow month.

42:24.042 --> 42:25.343
When are you gonna
get a real job?

42:25.343 --> 42:26.945
- I have a real job, Mom.

42:26.945 --> 42:28.980
I just, I need more clients.

42:28.980 --> 42:33.919
It's summer, so it's a slow
season for surf lessons.

42:33.919 --> 42:35.020
It's not for drugs.

42:36.187 --> 42:38.023
It's just for rent.

42:38.023 --> 42:43.028
I don't drink, I smoke
a little pot sometimes.

42:43.629 --> 42:44.162
A little pot.

42:45.263 --> 42:47.232
I'm trying, I'm
doing the best I can.

42:48.934 --> 42:53.171
I just gotta get, I just
gotta get over this month.

42:53.171 --> 42:55.106
- It's the last
time I'm doing this.

42:56.074 --> 42:56.875
I mean it.

42:59.077 --> 43:00.411
You're a 45 year old baby.

43:02.247 --> 43:03.081
- Ouch.

43:04.683 --> 43:05.516
See ya.

43:08.620 --> 43:09.454
- John!

43:12.290 --> 43:13.692
Come back and sit down.

43:33.244 --> 43:36.815
What's gonna happen
to you when I'm gone?

43:36.815 --> 43:39.417
You know, I'm gonna be fumigated
and stuck in the ground.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.319
There's not gonna be any
big inheritance coming.

43:41.319 --> 43:42.520
- I know, I know.

43:42.520 --> 43:44.255
- You gotta get
your shit together.

43:45.323 --> 43:47.025
You gotta find a good woman.

43:47.025 --> 43:50.628
Be a good husband
and be something.

43:51.629 --> 43:52.898
Otherwise you're just gonna be

43:52.898 --> 43:56.501
some loser son of a
bitch like your dad.

44:05.944 --> 44:07.979
It's long overdue
that you stand up

44:07.979 --> 44:11.382
and take responsibility
for yourself.

44:11.382 --> 44:12.751
Stop poaching off of me.

44:13.852 --> 44:15.721
You just, shape up and be a man,

44:15.721 --> 44:18.724
'cause that's the last goddamn
check I'm gonna write to you.

44:31.870 --> 44:33.138
- Your sponsors are
constantly here.

44:33.138 --> 44:34.706
Oh, there she is.

44:34.706 --> 44:36.975
Hey Jane, Jane!

44:38.209 --> 44:39.044
Hey.

44:40.411 --> 44:41.980
- Oh god, there he is.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.582
- Don't let it get to you.

44:44.582 --> 44:45.817
Just ignore him,
come on, come on.

44:47.652 --> 44:49.120
- That was smooth.

44:49.120 --> 44:51.556
- I don't know,
she didn't call me.

44:51.556 --> 44:55.526
She didn't write me, she
didn't text me, that's weird.

44:56.795 --> 44:58.629
- Hey Rose.
- Hey Rosie.

44:58.629 --> 44:59.564
- Hi guys.
- Hey Rose.

44:59.564 --> 45:00.966
-  Hey Jane, what's up?

45:02.000 --> 45:02.834
- Screw you.

45:02.834 --> 45:04.369
- Whoa.
- What?

45:04.369 --> 45:06.304
Hey, hey, what's with the
Jekyll and Hyde attitude?

45:06.304 --> 45:07.138
- Yeah.

45:08.940 --> 45:09.875
- You're a rapist.

45:09.875 --> 45:11.309
- What?
- Whoa, hey.

45:11.309 --> 45:12.911
Wait a minute, John's a
loser, but he's not a rapist.

45:12.911 --> 45:14.412
- Hold on, I didn't rape her.

45:14.412 --> 45:16.481
I did not rape you,
take that back.

45:16.481 --> 45:17.515
-  Take it back.

45:17.515 --> 45:19.017
- You're right, you're right.

45:19.017 --> 45:22.487
You didn't rape me, but you
certainly helped yourself

45:22.487 --> 45:25.423
to seconds the next morning
while I was trying to sleep.

45:25.423 --> 45:26.992
- Nothing wrong with that.

45:26.992 --> 45:29.795
- My recollection, Jane,
is that we came together,

45:29.795 --> 45:32.363
and it was real
hard and beautiful.

45:33.664 --> 45:35.600
- Oh, I faked it.

45:35.600 --> 45:38.336
- Ooh, she faked it.
- No, no, no, no.

45:39.504 --> 45:41.106
- You didn't come?

45:41.106 --> 45:41.973
Not even a little squirt?

45:41.973 --> 45:43.574
- Jesus.
- Hey, hey, hey!

45:43.574 --> 45:45.911
- Look, I'm calling DQ, okay?

45:45.911 --> 45:47.879
You lost the bet, you
still owe us money.

45:47.879 --> 45:49.147
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

45:49.147 --> 45:50.548
Did you bet on me?

45:50.548 --> 45:51.382
- No.

45:51.382 --> 45:52.717
-  Yes, you did.

45:52.717 --> 45:53.551
- Ugh!

45:55.253 --> 45:58.656
- Don't ever talk to me again.
- Just come back.

46:02.093 --> 46:03.161
- You guys are fired.

46:04.229 --> 46:06.097
- Fired, for what?

46:08.699 --> 46:09.700
How's this my fault?

46:11.069 --> 46:12.403
You didn't make her
come and it's my...

46:12.403 --> 46:13.238
John!

46:13.238 --> 46:14.472
- Yeah, you're pathetic.

46:14.472 --> 46:15.874
- John!
- You guys are so uncool.

46:15.874 --> 46:19.444
- Uh, hi, my name's Deen
and I'm an alcoholic.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.746
-  Hi Deen.

46:21.746 --> 46:23.514
- Yeah, how do you do?

46:24.682 --> 46:29.320
I've been sober for
like, four hours,

46:29.320 --> 46:31.823
and I got, I had this sponsor,

46:31.823 --> 46:36.828
and he fuckin' told me that
I had to get off all my meds,

46:37.996 --> 46:41.066
and it's like, I got
subscriptions to like,

46:41.066 --> 46:44.702
Adderall and suboxone, and like,

46:46.137 --> 46:47.572
I don't know how I could
fucking cope without them.

46:47.572 --> 46:49.807
I don't even know how I
could wake up in the morning,

46:49.807 --> 46:51.943
or even go to sleep,
and it's like,

46:51.943 --> 46:54.045
he told me that's how I
had to be really sober

46:54.045 --> 46:55.746
to get off of those
and it's like,

46:56.747 --> 46:57.916
I just, anyway I lost him.

46:57.916 --> 47:00.218
I lost that sponsor
and it's, uh,

47:00.218 --> 47:01.887
(sighs)

47:01.887 --> 47:03.521
it's been a hard day.

47:03.521 --> 47:06.524
(crickets chirping)

47:08.026 --> 47:10.561
- Hey Jane, hey Jane, Jane!

47:10.561 --> 47:11.496
- Don't!

47:11.496 --> 47:12.330
Don't touch me.

47:13.264 --> 47:14.832
- I just want to talk.

47:14.832 --> 47:16.801
I just want to talk to you.

47:16.801 --> 47:18.303
- You okay?
- Yeah.

47:19.570 --> 47:21.372
What do you want to talk about?

47:21.372 --> 47:22.507
- I just want to know why

47:22.507 --> 47:23.741
you said those terrible
things about me.

47:25.977 --> 47:27.145
- Did you even know

47:27.145 --> 47:30.015
there was another human
being in the room?

47:30.015 --> 47:32.783
- It's been so long since
there's been another human being

47:32.783 --> 47:34.619
in the room with me. (laughs)

47:34.619 --> 47:36.821
It was, hey, let's
watch another movie.

47:36.821 --> 47:38.756
I'll make it up to you.

47:38.756 --> 47:40.258
- No way, John.

47:40.258 --> 47:41.392
- Jane, give me another chance.

47:41.392 --> 47:42.527
- No!

47:42.527 --> 47:43.761
You know why, John?
- Why, why?

47:43.761 --> 47:45.730
- Because you are
totally undateable.

47:47.565 --> 47:48.666
- What does that mean?

47:52.070 --> 47:54.973
- It means please stay
the fuck away from me.

48:01.046 --> 48:02.213
- You missed a
good meeting, bro.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.414
- Hey Brutus, come here.

48:05.183 --> 48:06.017
- Brutus?
- It's okay, come on back.

48:06.017 --> 48:07.885
I'm not gonna hit you.

48:09.854 --> 48:14.325
Brutus, hey, Jane just
called me undateable.

48:14.325 --> 48:15.260
What does that mean?

48:15.260 --> 48:16.061
- Yeah, so what?

48:16.061 --> 48:16.894
You are.

48:16.894 --> 48:18.396
- But what?

48:18.396 --> 48:20.498
I'm smart, I'm funny, I
got a nice body, big dick.

48:20.498 --> 48:21.466
What's the problem?

48:23.834 --> 48:26.104
- First of all, you
don't have a car.

48:27.005 --> 48:28.806
You don't have a job.

48:28.806 --> 48:31.009
You share a room with
a dude named Fishbone.

48:33.278 --> 48:36.547
- Hey, he didn't even
ask me out on a date.

48:36.547 --> 48:40.185
He just assumed that
he was gonna come over.

48:40.185 --> 48:41.886
- He can't afford
to take you out.

48:41.886 --> 48:44.155
He borrows money
from his mother.

48:44.155 --> 48:49.160
- What a guy, you
don't want that.

48:50.061 --> 48:50.895
What?

48:51.829 --> 48:53.298
- It's Adam.

48:53.298 --> 48:55.033
- Crack is calling.

48:55.033 --> 48:56.801
- You got a crack dealer?

48:56.801 --> 48:59.937
- No, it's my ex.

48:59.937 --> 49:01.606
He's just...

49:03.608 --> 49:07.312
You know, I occasionally sleep
with, I really liked him.

49:12.583 --> 49:16.154
- I am an old, broke,

49:16.154 --> 49:19.757
no car, no house,
no health insurance,

49:19.757 --> 49:22.360
surf instructor,
alcoholic, drug addict.

49:23.328 --> 49:26.397
I do not look good on paper.

49:26.397 --> 49:29.967
So, what do I
bring to the table?

49:36.241 --> 49:41.246
I am smart, I am funny, I have
a nice body, and a big dick,

49:42.413 --> 49:47.085
and I bake fantastic cookies.

49:48.853 --> 49:51.289
So, what is the plan?

49:51.289 --> 49:52.190
- Hey, John.

49:52.190 --> 49:53.658
- Get out of my house.

49:53.658 --> 49:54.825
- Man, you're
acting like a baby.

49:54.825 --> 49:55.993
You know the rules

49:55.993 --> 49:57.328
when it comes to betting
on the 13th step.

49:57.328 --> 49:59.297
- Were you up inside
of her vagina?

49:59.297 --> 50:00.765
Were you inside of her vagina?

50:00.765 --> 50:02.600
- No John, I was not
inside her vagina.

50:02.600 --> 50:04.835
- Okay good, because I
was inside of her vagina.

50:04.835 --> 50:05.670
(Scott laughs)

50:05.670 --> 50:06.904
- Okay.

50:06.904 --> 50:09.340
- I was in her vagina
when she had an orgasm.

50:09.340 --> 50:10.275
Who are you gonna believe?

50:10.275 --> 50:11.209
- Listen, it doesn't matter.

50:11.209 --> 50:12.543
There's a foreigner in the game,

50:12.543 --> 50:14.412
and he's definitely
not on the team.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.713
- How do you know?

50:15.713 --> 50:17.615
- Jane got a text, a booty call.

50:17.615 --> 50:19.517
- Jane got a booty call text?

50:19.517 --> 50:21.186
- Yeah, from some
guy named Adam.

50:21.186 --> 50:23.288
I think he's a
crackhead, crack dealer.

50:23.288 --> 50:24.555
- Okay, wait a minute.

50:24.555 --> 50:25.890
Is he a crackhead
or a crack dealer?

50:25.890 --> 50:26.857
- He's rich.

50:26.857 --> 50:28.393
- He's rich?

50:28.393 --> 50:29.227
- And younger.

50:30.495 --> 50:32.163
- He's younger than I am?
- Yeah.

50:32.163 --> 50:33.331
- And he's richer than I am?

50:33.331 --> 50:34.565
- Yeah, and I think
she loves him.

50:36.134 --> 50:38.169
- Why do you think
she loves him?

50:38.169 --> 50:41.806
- Because she said, quote,
"He would be a great father."

50:42.840 --> 50:43.641
- She said that?

50:44.875 --> 50:45.643
- Yeah.

50:46.777 --> 50:48.713
- Okay, where is she?

50:48.713 --> 50:50.915
- Probably putting
on something sexy.

50:50.915 --> 50:53.384
- Give me your keys, give
me the keys to your car.

50:58.022 --> 51:00.191
That was a good choice.

51:00.191 --> 51:01.759
Now you can have a cookie,

51:01.759 --> 51:04.262
and you're back on
the team, buddy.

51:04.262 --> 51:05.463
- Oh, and she said
one more thing.

51:05.463 --> 51:08.166
It's Saturday night
and she wants good sex.

51:09.467 --> 51:12.703
(energetic rock music)

51:19.110 --> 51:20.878
(sighs)

51:20.878 --> 51:22.147
* Wanna be bright but I
confess I never cared *

51:22.147 --> 51:23.914
* Terminal boredom,
terminal boredom *

51:23.914 --> 51:26.384
* A pee-chee stained with
drool is lying on the stairs *

51:26.384 --> 51:29.019
* Terminal boredom,
terminal boredom *

51:29.019 --> 51:31.622
* Feet don't move
any other way *

51:31.622 --> 51:34.192
* Arms lie still,
eyes begin to glaze *

51:34.192 --> 51:36.727
* And just last night
I heard my baby say *

51:36.727 --> 51:39.297
* Terminal boredom, boredom

51:39.297 --> 51:41.766
* Terminal boredom, boredom

51:41.766 --> 51:43.100
* Tell me something dumb

51:43.100 --> 51:44.402
* Or something cute
over the telephone *

51:44.402 --> 51:46.904
* Terminal boredom,
terminal boredom *

51:46.904 --> 51:49.374
* I need to be distracted,
I don't want to be alone *

51:49.374 --> 51:52.009
* Terminal boredom,
terminal boredom *

51:52.009 --> 51:54.645
* Can't stay fixed,
every single day *

51:54.645 --> 51:58.949
* Boredom creeps,
ain't even afraid *

52:00.151 --> 52:01.519
- Just a little.

52:01.519 --> 52:02.753
* Terminal boredom, boredom

52:02.753 --> 52:06.424
* Terminal boredom, boredom

52:08.125 --> 52:08.959
- Oh!

52:22.507 --> 52:24.675
(moaning)

52:33.017 --> 52:34.852
- Oh my god.

52:34.852 --> 52:36.120
-  Oh shit!

52:36.120 --> 52:37.922
- Is this what you do
when I'm out of town?

52:37.922 --> 52:40.358
- No babe, this isn't happening.

52:40.358 --> 52:41.526
- This isn't happening?

52:42.993 --> 52:46.364
I just saw you eating out
this whore in my kitchen.

52:46.364 --> 52:47.932
- I am not a whore.

52:47.932 --> 52:49.166
Who are you?

52:49.166 --> 52:52.603
- This is my house and
this was my fiance.

52:52.603 --> 52:54.639
- Fiance, what?

52:54.639 --> 52:58.476
You told me this was your
house for the last year.

52:58.476 --> 53:00.711
- Wait, you've been sleeping
with her for a year?

53:00.711 --> 53:01.646
- It was not that long.

53:01.646 --> 53:02.580
- What the fuck, you bitch!

53:02.580 --> 53:04.515
(shouting)

53:04.515 --> 53:05.683
You whore!

53:05.683 --> 53:06.684
- You bitch!

53:08.152 --> 53:10.755
- Okay, that's it,
I am done with this!

53:10.755 --> 53:13.358
- No, no, no!
- Babe, no babe, no!

53:13.358 --> 53:14.859
No, shit!

53:14.859 --> 53:16.994
- No, no, no, no, no, no.
- I am done, I am done!

53:16.994 --> 53:19.597
Don't you ever call
me babe again, ever!

53:19.597 --> 53:21.799
Just get your whore and get
the fuck out of my house.

53:21.799 --> 53:23.000
- Okay!

53:23.000 --> 53:24.302
- Don't call my
girlfriend a whore.

53:24.302 --> 53:25.570
- What?
- Who the fuck are you?

53:25.570 --> 53:27.004
- I'm her boyfriend.

53:27.004 --> 53:28.406
She's my girlfriend.

53:28.406 --> 53:29.840
- I'm not your girlfriend.

53:29.840 --> 53:31.776
Why the hell did you get here?

53:31.776 --> 53:33.511
- Baby, I was making us
chocolate chip cookies

53:33.511 --> 53:35.546
with the sea salt like you
like, and Scott came over,

53:35.546 --> 53:37.882
and said you were getting a
booty call from some crackhead.

53:37.882 --> 53:41.118
So I got upset because you are
my girlfriend, and you know,

53:41.118 --> 53:42.820
I called you but you
didn't pick up your phone,

53:42.820 --> 53:44.188
so I took his car
and I followed you.

53:44.188 --> 53:45.089
- No, no, no.
- You have to stop talking!

53:45.089 --> 53:46.023
Just stop talking.

53:46.023 --> 53:48.125
- Stop and get the fuck out.

53:48.125 --> 53:50.127
- Thank you.
- Go, go, go, go!

53:50.127 --> 53:51.296
-  Walk.

53:53.898 --> 53:55.400
-  Seriously,
get the fuck out!

53:55.400 --> 53:56.634
-  Babe, babe--

53:56.634 --> 53:57.602
- What the fuck
were you thinking?

53:57.602 --> 53:58.436
-  Babe, come on, come on.

53:58.436 --> 53:59.504
It was only one time!

53:59.504 --> 54:00.738
- You fucking bitch!
- Oh!

54:00.738 --> 54:02.940
- How dare you follow me!

54:02.940 --> 54:03.874
- I care about you.

54:03.874 --> 54:05.009
Baby, you shouldn't be driving.

54:05.009 --> 54:05.876
I don't want you
sleeping with that jerk.

54:05.876 --> 54:07.011
You are my girlfriend.

54:08.245 --> 54:10.515
- I am not your girl.

54:10.515 --> 54:11.482
- I got your purse.

54:13.217 --> 54:14.385
- That's not mine.

54:18.055 --> 54:19.590
- That guy doesn't even surf!

54:24.194 --> 54:26.697
(car engine revving)

54:26.697 --> 54:28.065
Goddamn it.

54:28.065 --> 54:31.001
(light rock music)

54:38.376 --> 54:39.344
- What is this?

54:40.511 --> 54:42.079
What kind, like is it real?

54:42.079 --> 54:43.381
'Cause I can't have dairy.

54:45.015 --> 54:47.952
(light rock music)

54:50.921 --> 54:52.089
- Hey, what happened?

54:52.089 --> 54:52.923
- She hates me.

54:55.125 --> 54:56.961
You ate all the cookies.

54:56.961 --> 54:58.062
Those were for Jane.

54:58.062 --> 55:00.030
- They were pretty good.

55:00.030 --> 55:01.131
- That's my private journal.

55:01.131 --> 55:02.066
- Yeah, I see that.

55:02.066 --> 55:03.368
You know, I'm really touched.

55:03.368 --> 55:05.169
You wrote some nice
things about me.

55:10.875 --> 55:12.377
- Anything I can
do to get her back?

55:12.377 --> 55:13.210
-  No.

55:14.912 --> 55:17.815
(light rock music)

55:22.252 --> 55:24.522
(sniffing)

55:54.184 --> 55:55.586
- Now what is it?

56:01.559 --> 56:02.727
John.

56:02.727 --> 56:04.061
"I wish we could
start all over again.

56:04.061 --> 56:05.963
"Please accept my apology,

56:05.963 --> 56:09.767
"and let me take you
out for a nice dinner.

56:09.767 --> 56:11.802
"Please say yes."

56:11.802 --> 56:14.004
- That was really sweet.

56:14.004 --> 56:15.540
Are you gonna go
to dinner with him?

56:17.274 --> 56:18.075
- We'll see.

56:21.078 --> 56:24.381
(bus engine revving)

56:24.381 --> 56:27.452
(background chatter)

56:30.421 --> 56:32.122
- I ended up working on
Santa Monica Boulevard

56:32.122 --> 56:35.693
with some other runaways
and we did tricks,

56:35.693 --> 56:38.028
that's what they're called.

56:38.028 --> 56:40.865
We sucked guys' dicks, you know?

56:40.865 --> 56:43.801
And there was one
guy in particular, we
called him Old Spice

56:43.801 --> 56:45.736
'cause he smelled like his
balls smelled like Old Spice,

56:45.736 --> 56:48.238
like he put it on and then
he put it in his pants,

56:48.238 --> 56:50.007
one of those fuckin' dudes.

56:50.007 --> 56:55.012
And I mean, I could
tolerate the dick sucking,

56:56.180 --> 57:00.050
but the Old Spice
was gagging me.

57:00.050 --> 57:02.987
Hey guys, guy, hey John!

57:02.987 --> 57:04.722
It's a meeting, please.

57:04.722 --> 57:05.990
- I'm just trying to see

57:05.990 --> 57:06.791
if she's gonna go
to dinner with me.

57:06.791 --> 57:08.392
I'm sorry, Billy.

57:08.392 --> 57:09.860
- Okay.

57:09.860 --> 57:11.095
- Did you have to say
that in front of everyone?

57:11.095 --> 57:11.929
- Say yes.

57:15.265 --> 57:17.902
- Say you'll go to dinner with
him and then we can move on.

57:20.805 --> 57:22.907
- I will go to dinner with you.

57:22.907 --> 57:25.342
- All right, all right.
- That's gonna cost me.

57:25.342 --> 57:27.712
- Okay, back to the meeting.

57:27.712 --> 57:29.279
All right, amends.

57:29.279 --> 57:30.748
- Screw amends, man.

57:32.382 --> 57:36.320
I'm so sick of you people and
all your honesty bullshit.

57:38.122 --> 57:39.757
I told my wife, okay?

57:39.757 --> 57:41.358
I told her everything and
you know what she did?

57:41.358 --> 57:43.027
She left me.

57:43.027 --> 57:44.361
What am I supposed
to do now, huh?

57:44.361 --> 57:46.263
Her lawyer's about
to scrape me clean.

57:47.665 --> 57:48.999
And what, I'm supposed
to go back to some hooker

57:48.999 --> 57:50.467
at some seedy hotel room?

57:57.542 --> 57:58.475
- Thanks, Larry.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.344
That's good, that's good.

58:00.344 --> 58:01.979
Yeah Larry, right.

58:01.979 --> 58:03.648
All right, who's next?

58:03.648 --> 58:05.115
- She said yes!

58:05.115 --> 58:07.985
Can I get that 100 bucks
that you said you'd loan me?

58:07.985 --> 58:09.186
- I'm suicidal, man.

58:09.186 --> 58:11.188
I don't have no
more money for you.

58:11.188 --> 58:13.223
- Can't you see he's
suicidal, asshole?

58:13.223 --> 58:14.424
His wife hates him.

58:14.424 --> 58:15.760
She's probably gonna
sleep with another man.

58:15.760 --> 58:17.427
- What?
- I'm sorry.

58:17.427 --> 58:19.496
- Sorry, sorry, man.

58:19.496 --> 58:21.732
Scott, please?
- No.

58:21.732 --> 58:23.167
- I'll wash your car.
- No.

58:23.167 --> 58:24.201
- I'll clean your house.
- No.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.369
- I'll do your laundry?

58:26.503 --> 58:27.738
- Will you do my
daughter's laundry?

58:27.738 --> 58:28.939
- I'll be your slave.

58:28.939 --> 58:30.608
- Wait, don't say that.
- That's disturbing.

58:30.608 --> 58:32.242
- Don't say that.

58:32.242 --> 58:33.310
- Yes!

58:33.310 --> 58:34.712
What would I do without you?

58:35.913 --> 58:36.747
- You'll pay me back, right?

58:36.747 --> 58:37.582
- Oh yeah, totally.

58:40.217 --> 58:43.087
Um, I don't have any
clean shirts or anything.

58:43.087 --> 58:44.555
- What do you want me to
do, lend you a fucking suit?

58:44.555 --> 58:46.390
- Yes, awesome!

58:46.390 --> 58:47.224
- Rapist.

58:50.260 --> 58:52.563
- How about this one?

58:52.563 --> 58:53.831
This is the one.

58:53.831 --> 58:55.265
- I don't like it.
- Yeah, I like it.

58:55.265 --> 58:56.066
- No, it doesn't suit me.
- No, it's this one.

58:56.066 --> 58:57.367
- No, it's not me, man.

58:58.268 --> 58:59.203
I don't like it.

58:59.203 --> 59:00.871
- Pick something you want.

59:00.871 --> 59:02.239
- Anything I want?

59:02.239 --> 59:05.576
(Scott sighs)

59:05.576 --> 59:06.410
- Hey.

59:06.410 --> 59:07.344
- What is he doing?

59:07.344 --> 59:08.579
He didn't finish my laundry yet.

59:08.579 --> 59:10.581
- Uncle John's on
his lunch break.

59:10.581 --> 59:11.816
He's got a date.

59:11.816 --> 59:12.783
Want to help us find
something to wear?

59:12.783 --> 59:14.785
- With a girl.
- Okay.

59:14.785 --> 59:16.020
- How's this look?

59:16.020 --> 59:17.087
- Goofy.

59:17.087 --> 59:17.755
You don't look good.
- Goofy.

59:19.289 --> 59:20.758
- Okay.

59:20.758 --> 59:22.627
- He hasn't been on
a date since Anna.

59:22.627 --> 59:23.828
- Oh, okay.

59:25.529 --> 59:26.363
Wow.

59:28.633 --> 59:30.935
You look fat, you look fat.

59:30.935 --> 59:31.802
- I look fat?

59:31.802 --> 59:32.937
- You look fat in this.

59:32.937 --> 59:33.738
- Do I look fat?
- You look fat in this.

59:33.738 --> 59:34.705
- Have I gotten fat?

59:34.705 --> 59:35.640
Do you think I'm fat?

59:35.640 --> 59:36.573
- I don't think you're fat.

59:36.573 --> 59:37.507
You look fat in this suit.

59:37.507 --> 59:38.609
- You look fat, change it.

59:39.644 --> 59:40.878
- I don't know what to wear!

59:40.878 --> 59:41.812
- Try the black one.

59:41.812 --> 59:43.047
- No, that's my favorite suit.

59:43.047 --> 59:44.682
-  Black one?

59:44.682 --> 59:46.283
- It's his first date in awhile.

59:48.018 --> 59:48.853
Come on already.

59:51.421 --> 59:52.589
That looks nice.

59:52.589 --> 59:53.824
- It's nice, it's nice?

59:53.824 --> 59:55.225
- Even I would date
you in that suit.

59:55.225 --> 59:56.526
- No, you wouldn't.
- Really?

59:56.526 --> 59:57.628
- Okay.

59:57.628 --> 59:59.797
- It's really nice.
- Yeah.

01:00:01.398 --> 01:00:02.633
- I'm just nervous, dude.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:03.768
I don't know how
to act on a date.

01:00:03.768 --> 01:00:05.002
- Just be yourself.

01:00:05.002 --> 01:00:06.737
- No Dad, he can't be himself!

01:00:06.737 --> 01:00:08.673
He can't be goofy,
he has to be nice.

01:00:08.673 --> 01:00:11.408
He was to treat her like a
lady and tell her she's pretty,

01:00:11.408 --> 01:00:12.643
and chew with your mouth closed,

01:00:12.643 --> 01:00:14.044
and you can't fart
in front of her

01:00:14.044 --> 01:00:16.613
and pull out your underwear
to let the wind out.

01:00:16.613 --> 01:00:19.283
- You noticed that?
- Duh, you do it all the time.

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.417
- You do it all the time.

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:21.886
- What else should I do?

01:00:21.886 --> 01:00:22.953
- You have to walk on the
outside of the street,

01:00:22.953 --> 01:00:23.788
right, Daddy?

01:00:23.788 --> 01:00:25.089
- That's correct.

01:00:25.089 --> 01:00:26.523
- Are you gonna kiss her?
- I hope so.

01:00:26.523 --> 01:00:28.625
- Daddy says good girls
don't kiss on the first date.

01:00:28.625 --> 01:00:29.459
- That's correct.

01:00:30.661 --> 01:00:32.529
- And you have to open
the car door for her.

01:00:32.529 --> 01:00:34.264
- That's correct, the car door.

01:00:34.264 --> 01:00:36.233
I need your car.
- No.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.334
- Yeah.
- No.

01:00:37.334 --> 01:00:38.302
- Come on, Daddy.
- No.

01:00:38.302 --> 01:00:39.636
- I'm not taking a bus, dude.

01:00:39.636 --> 01:00:40.771
- He can't take her on the bus.

01:00:40.771 --> 01:00:42.372
What would you do?

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:44.775
- Your 10 year old,
10 year old daughter!

01:00:44.775 --> 01:00:46.243
- Okay, take the car.

01:00:46.243 --> 01:00:48.979
- Hey Lanie, you're my
favorite baby girl forever.

01:00:48.979 --> 01:00:49.947
Number one!

01:00:49.947 --> 01:00:51.749
- You have to finish my laundry.

01:00:51.749 --> 01:00:54.251
- You're just a little
troublemaker too, my car, huh?

01:00:54.251 --> 01:00:55.519
(Lanie laughs)

01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:57.354
- No!
- Little smartypants.

01:00:57.354 --> 01:01:01.258
(restaurant patrons chattering)

01:01:02.259 --> 01:01:03.961
- For the lady.
- Thanks.

01:01:05.595 --> 01:01:07.064
- For you, sir.
- Thank you.

01:01:08.465 --> 01:01:12.002
- May I start you guys off
with a bottle of wine tonight?

01:01:12.002 --> 01:01:14.905
Perhaps a light
peppery Sangiovese?

01:01:15.973 --> 01:01:17.908
Or my personal favorite
is the Amarone.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:21.111
It's a spicy, yet subtle--

01:01:21.111 --> 01:01:22.646
- Just two glasses
of water, please.

01:01:22.646 --> 01:01:23.480
- Oh, water.

01:01:23.480 --> 01:01:25.615
No, that's perfect.

01:01:25.615 --> 01:01:28.953
(upbeat acoustic music)

01:01:38.495 --> 01:01:39.429
- I think you already said
you were gonna get it,

01:01:39.429 --> 01:01:40.831
so I'm gonna get garlic too.

01:01:40.831 --> 01:01:42.733
- We both have garlic.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:44.869
- Not that that means anything.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:45.803
- No, I know.

01:01:45.803 --> 01:01:47.037
No, it doesn't.

01:01:47.037 --> 01:01:48.638
- But we'll be
around each other.

01:01:49.706 --> 01:01:52.042
- Um, so...

01:01:54.444 --> 01:01:55.645
Mm.

01:01:55.645 --> 01:01:57.214
- Okay, do you
taste all that food?

01:01:59.316 --> 01:02:00.650
- It tastes great.

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:03.888
People who don't drink
aren't bad. (laughs)

01:02:05.355 --> 01:02:06.456
- Twirling, twirling, twirling.

01:02:06.456 --> 01:02:08.725
Yeah, and lift, ah!

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:09.994
Perfect bite.

01:02:09.994 --> 01:02:11.295
- That was a perfect bite.

01:02:11.295 --> 01:02:13.430
I like learning new things.

01:02:13.430 --> 01:02:14.865
- I really like this restaurant.

01:02:14.865 --> 01:02:17.567
- It's got a nice ambiance.

01:02:17.567 --> 01:02:18.836
Is that right?

01:02:18.836 --> 01:02:20.070
- You have a car,
I have a license.

01:02:20.070 --> 01:02:21.605
I don't have a car, you
don't have a license.

01:02:21.605 --> 01:02:22.807
I should drive your car.

01:02:22.807 --> 01:02:24.141
- A little bit, right here.

01:02:24.141 --> 01:02:25.742
- I have stuff on my face?
- Right here.

01:02:25.742 --> 01:02:27.311
(Jane gasps)

01:02:27.311 --> 01:02:28.145
- Oh my god!

01:02:29.513 --> 01:02:30.480
Oh my god!

01:02:30.480 --> 01:02:31.415
- It's okay, it's okay.

01:02:31.415 --> 01:02:32.649
- No, I have to clean this.

01:02:34.118 --> 01:02:35.019
Will you marry me?

01:02:37.654 --> 01:02:39.756
- Wow, on our first date.

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:40.825
- That was not a no.

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:43.127
That's wasn't a no.

01:02:44.194 --> 01:02:47.197
(upbeat rock music)

01:02:50.234 --> 01:02:51.068
I'll say.

01:03:02.112 --> 01:03:03.380
- I had a really nice time.

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:06.216
- So did I.

01:03:06.216 --> 01:03:09.319
- So, you don't
want me to come up?

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:13.557
- I thought we were
supposed to start again.

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:15.492
- Yes.

01:03:15.492 --> 01:03:16.493
- That's what you wanted.

01:03:16.493 --> 01:03:18.896
- I know, I want, I said it.

01:03:18.896 --> 01:03:19.830
You're right.

01:03:19.830 --> 01:03:20.931
I mean it too, I meant it.

01:03:22.833 --> 01:03:24.801
Well, when can I see you again?

01:03:24.801 --> 01:03:25.735
- At a meeting.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.272
- No, no, that doesn't count.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.339
That's not the same.

01:03:31.976 --> 01:03:33.777
Would you come surfing with me?

01:03:33.777 --> 01:03:35.880
You said you wanted to try it.

01:03:38.682 --> 01:03:39.516
- Okay.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:40.450
- Oh, good.

01:03:40.450 --> 01:03:41.385
- Okay, let's go surf Sunday.

01:03:41.385 --> 01:03:42.219
- Let's go surfing Sunday.

01:03:42.219 --> 01:03:43.453
- I'd love to go.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:44.588
- It's on then.
- Okay.

01:03:44.588 --> 01:03:45.589
- All right.

01:03:47.724 --> 01:03:49.059
- On the cheek.

01:03:49.059 --> 01:03:50.360
- On the cheek.

01:03:50.360 --> 01:03:53.297
(bright pop music)

01:04:02.406 --> 01:04:05.242
(water splashing)

01:04:10.380 --> 01:04:13.083
-  Jesus, John,
obviously the date went great.

01:04:13.083 --> 01:04:15.319
- It's a little stain, I got
a little stain on the suit.

01:04:15.319 --> 01:04:16.253
- It's not a little stain.

01:04:16.253 --> 01:04:17.287
You gotta get it dry cleaned.

01:04:17.287 --> 01:04:18.655
- Put it on my tab.
- Tab?

01:04:18.655 --> 01:04:19.890
You don't have a tab, no.

01:04:19.890 --> 01:04:20.790
- I'm gonna pay
you back, come on.

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:21.691
- Pay me back?

01:04:21.691 --> 01:04:22.626
Who have you paid back?

01:04:22.626 --> 01:04:23.593
Name one person you paid back.

01:04:23.593 --> 01:04:25.195
- My life's together, man.

01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:26.063
I got a girlfriend now.

01:04:26.063 --> 01:04:27.564
(Scott laughs)

01:04:27.564 --> 01:04:28.798
- Get your life together,
you've got a girlfriend now.

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:30.000
You've gone out on one date,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.635
that really doesn't
constitute a girlfriend.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:32.869
- I'm gonna give
her surf lessons.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:34.538
- What a scammer,
you're so cheap.

01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:38.008
- I can see her in a bathing
suit, all wet and beautiful.

01:04:38.008 --> 01:04:39.209
- Yeah, they all
get old eventually.

01:04:39.209 --> 01:04:40.911
- She's different.

01:04:40.911 --> 01:04:42.512
I think I'm in love with her.

01:04:42.512 --> 01:04:44.148
- Oh my god, I'm
in love with her?

01:04:44.148 --> 01:04:46.283
Oh, I'm in love with her
one date, that's called--

01:04:46.283 --> 01:04:48.218
- What do you mean, they
all get old eventually?

01:04:48.218 --> 01:04:49.153
Did Mom get old on you?

01:04:49.153 --> 01:04:50.654
That's why you kicked her out?

01:04:53.323 --> 01:04:55.359
- No, no, Daddy
didn't kick Mommy out.

01:04:55.359 --> 01:04:56.226
Mommy left me.

01:04:56.226 --> 01:04:57.894
- You mean she left us?

01:04:57.894 --> 01:05:00.197
- Well, shes a drunk.
- Hey, hey, hey!

01:05:00.197 --> 01:05:02.599
- Just, she wasn't a bad person.

01:05:02.599 --> 01:05:03.833
It's not her fault.

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.269
She was a sick person
like me and your daddy.

01:05:05.269 --> 01:05:06.136
- That's enough.

01:05:09.974 --> 01:05:11.608
- I'll get your
suit dry cleaned.

01:05:13.978 --> 01:05:15.045
You're out of gas.

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:28.758
- It's not like I didn't know.

01:05:28.758 --> 01:05:31.495
Just like you thought I
didn't know what a hickey was.

01:05:31.495 --> 01:05:32.696
- You know what a hickey is?

01:05:32.696 --> 01:05:34.864
- Yeah, it's where
you suck on the neck.

01:05:34.864 --> 01:05:36.533
- Okay. (laughs)

01:05:36.533 --> 01:05:38.368
That's enough.

01:05:38.368 --> 01:05:40.370
(sighs)

01:05:41.505 --> 01:05:42.339
I'm sorry.

01:05:45.742 --> 01:05:48.212
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

01:05:48.212 --> 01:05:51.948
- I wish I had a rich husband,

01:05:51.948 --> 01:05:53.717
so I could lay by
the pool all day.

01:05:53.717 --> 01:05:55.319
(Rose laughs)

01:05:55.319 --> 01:06:00.090
- Well, it can be boring being
a tossed aside trophy wife.

01:06:00.090 --> 01:06:01.558
(laughs)

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:02.392
- Okay.

01:06:02.392 --> 01:06:04.161
- So, how was the date?

01:06:05.729 --> 01:06:07.631
- He was so cute!

01:06:07.631 --> 01:06:10.200
He wore a suit.
- No?

01:06:10.200 --> 01:06:11.701
- Yeah.

01:06:11.701 --> 01:06:13.403
- I've never seen
him in anything

01:06:13.403 --> 01:06:16.706
other than flip-flops and
a dirty T-shirt. (laughs)

01:06:16.706 --> 01:06:17.774
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

01:06:19.843 --> 01:06:22.646
- He's taking me for a
surfing lesson tomorrow.

01:06:22.646 --> 01:06:25.182
- Oh no, you're dating
Undateable John.

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:29.253
- Oh, he's growing on me.

01:06:29.253 --> 01:06:30.654
He likes me.

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.591
- Jane.

01:06:34.591 --> 01:06:38.228
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:06:38.228 --> 01:06:39.429
-  If you could do
one or the other thing

01:06:39.429 --> 01:06:40.630
for the rest of your
life, which would it be?

01:06:40.630 --> 01:06:43.100
Surf or have sex with
a beautiful woman?

01:06:43.100 --> 01:06:44.301
-  Surf.

01:06:44.301 --> 01:06:45.702
-  That how I felt
when I was your age.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:47.003
Now I'd rather be with a
beautiful woman than just surf,

01:06:47.003 --> 01:06:48.572
so I can share surfing with her.

01:06:48.572 --> 01:06:49.706
I want to share things with her,

01:06:49.706 --> 01:06:50.940
and surfing's a beautiful thing,

01:06:50.940 --> 01:06:52.742
and I want to share it
with my beautiful woman.

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:54.144
-  So, it's
like community service?

01:06:54.144 --> 01:06:55.345
- Yeah, you're being of service.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:56.746
- So you're like,
helping other people,

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.548
by having sex with them?
- Yes, that's what I do.

01:06:58.548 --> 01:07:00.550
That's what, exact, that's
what teaching surfing is,

01:07:00.550 --> 01:07:02.052
and that's what
having good sex is.

01:07:02.052 --> 01:07:03.187
You're helping the other person.

01:07:03.187 --> 01:07:04.454
- Now see, that I can get with.

01:07:04.454 --> 01:07:05.955
- Yeah.

01:07:05.955 --> 01:07:07.857
- That I can go out at night,
and feel good about myself,

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:09.826
knowing that I'm gonna
help these girls.

01:07:09.826 --> 01:07:11.528
- I used to think that way.
- You did?

01:07:11.528 --> 01:07:13.230
- Yeah.
- So, you used to be cool?

01:07:13.230 --> 01:07:15.799
- Yeah, a long time ago.
- What happened, man?

01:07:15.799 --> 01:07:17.134
- I grew up.

01:07:17.134 --> 01:07:20.970
(light acoustic guitar music)

01:07:26.210 --> 01:07:29.546
(bus brakes screeching)

01:07:32.149 --> 01:07:33.417
Hide that, you gotta hide that.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:34.351
She's coming over right now.

01:07:34.351 --> 01:07:35.285
In fact, you should hide too.

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:36.620
Just, can you just disappear?

01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:37.821
- No way, bro.

01:07:37.821 --> 01:07:39.089
I'm a check out
this toothless loser

01:07:39.089 --> 01:07:40.357
you got coming over
from rehab. (laughs)

01:07:40.357 --> 01:07:41.891
- Put a shirt on at least.

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.760
- This is my look,
I'm getting some sun.

01:07:45.362 --> 01:07:46.563
- Hello, hello, knock, knock.

01:07:46.563 --> 01:07:47.764
Hello, hello, hello.
- She's here.

01:07:47.764 --> 01:07:49.766
- Knock, knock, knock.
- Hey, hey, Jane!

01:07:49.766 --> 01:07:50.600
Hi.

01:07:50.600 --> 01:07:51.768
- Hi!

01:07:51.768 --> 01:07:52.436
-  You look great,
thanks for coming.

01:07:52.436 --> 01:07:53.837
-  Thanks.

01:07:53.837 --> 01:07:55.372
- This is my roommate, Fishbone.

01:07:55.372 --> 01:07:57.607
- Hi, Fishbone.
- Just call me Bone.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:58.775
Nice to meet you,
not so plain Jane.

01:07:58.775 --> 01:08:00.177
I heard a lot about ya.

01:08:00.177 --> 01:08:01.911
- Easy.
- Really, what?

01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:06.483
- Oh, just that you make our
friend Johnny here so happy.

01:08:07.684 --> 01:08:08.852
-  That's sweet.

01:08:08.852 --> 01:08:11.421
- You're late for
spinning or butt class.

01:08:11.421 --> 01:08:12.356
What do you do?

01:08:12.356 --> 01:08:13.423
- Yeah, today's abs and butt.

01:08:13.423 --> 01:08:15.425
You should come by, Janie.

01:08:15.425 --> 01:08:17.527
- No.
- Nice to meet ya.

01:08:17.527 --> 01:08:19.328
- Yeah, and you.

01:08:19.328 --> 01:08:21.064
- Okay, thank you.
- No, I'm just saying.

01:08:21.064 --> 01:08:22.232
- Thanks for
everything, all right?

01:08:22.232 --> 01:08:23.733
I mean that, do that thing.

01:08:23.733 --> 01:08:24.901
Okay, he's a kid.

01:08:24.901 --> 01:08:26.203
He's a nice kid.

01:08:26.203 --> 01:08:28.438
Okay, this is for you, ready?

01:08:28.438 --> 01:08:30.274
- Well, I don't
know how ready I am.

01:08:30.274 --> 01:08:34.611
It's small, but I'm as
ready as I'll ever be.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:35.812
- Nothing to be scared of.

01:08:35.812 --> 01:08:38.448
I'm gonna take really
good care of you.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:39.983
You're in really good hands.

01:08:39.983 --> 01:08:41.484
- That's a huge board.

01:08:41.484 --> 01:08:43.353
-  I know, it's perfect
for what we're doing today.

01:08:43.353 --> 01:08:45.555
Perfect tool for the job.

01:08:50.126 --> 01:08:51.361
-  Why do I stay cooped up

01:08:51.361 --> 01:08:53.263
in my apartment all day long?

01:08:53.263 --> 01:08:55.198
- Yeah, the ocean's
my higher power.

01:08:55.198 --> 01:08:57.466
Riding waves is like
conscious contact

01:08:57.466 --> 01:08:58.868
with a power
greater than myself.

01:08:58.868 --> 01:09:00.504
I just don't like when
they trash it out,

01:09:00.504 --> 01:09:01.604
do you know what I mean?

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:07.444
Okay, I'm gonna give you a
beginning standup surf lesson.

01:09:09.145 --> 01:09:10.947
Are you a regular
foot or a goofy foot?

01:09:13.317 --> 01:09:14.350
Okay great, perfect.

01:09:14.350 --> 01:09:15.419
You're a regular foot.

01:09:15.419 --> 01:09:16.786
I'm a goofy.

01:09:16.786 --> 01:09:18.587
- Uh-huh.
- Bring your feet up.

01:09:18.587 --> 01:09:21.558
- Good, press your back
foot down, stand up.

01:09:21.558 --> 01:09:23.760
That's perfect, that's
exactly what we're gonna do.

01:09:23.760 --> 01:09:27.029
(energetic rock music)

01:09:35.305 --> 01:09:37.807
(Jane shouts)

01:09:41.377 --> 01:09:43.880
(shouting)

01:09:43.880 --> 01:09:46.750
* So screwed up

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:49.586
* So screwed up

01:09:49.586 --> 01:09:51.421
* So screwed up

01:09:51.421 --> 01:09:53.990
(Jane moaning)

01:10:12.709 --> 01:10:15.979
(energetic rock music)

01:10:19.649 --> 01:10:22.919
- Excellent, awesome,
oh, that's great.

01:10:24.388 --> 01:10:26.323
Perfect, you're the best
surfer in the whole world.

01:10:26.323 --> 01:10:27.557
- I can't believe.

01:10:27.557 --> 01:10:29.493
I can't believe you did that.

01:10:29.493 --> 01:10:30.627
- What?

01:10:30.627 --> 01:10:31.795
- You came inside me.

01:10:31.795 --> 01:10:32.729
- What's the problem?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:34.097
You're my girlfriend.

01:10:34.097 --> 01:10:35.499
We can have sex, baby,
it's good, it's okay.

01:10:35.499 --> 01:10:36.900
- I could get pregnant.

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.502
- No, you cannot get
pregnant in the ocean, baby.

01:10:38.502 --> 01:10:39.336
Everybody knows that.

01:10:39.336 --> 01:10:40.537
- What?

01:10:40.537 --> 01:10:41.371
- You can't get
pregnant in the water.

01:10:41.371 --> 01:10:42.606
I thought you knew that.

01:10:42.606 --> 01:10:44.508
- Are you sure?
- Yes, positive.

01:10:45.675 --> 01:10:46.876
And I would never
have sex with a woman

01:10:46.876 --> 01:10:49.045
I wouldn't want to
have a kid with anyway.

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.748
You're the best first
time surfer I've
ever seen in my life.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:53.317
Awesome, want to go do it again?

01:10:54.784 --> 01:10:55.619
- No, I'm okay.

01:10:55.619 --> 01:10:56.586
Are you sure?

01:10:56.586 --> 01:10:57.454
- Yeah, I'm positive, baby.

01:10:57.454 --> 01:10:58.455
Everybody knows that.

01:10:59.389 --> 01:11:02.125
(water splashing)

01:11:03.460 --> 01:11:04.294
I told you, you
were safe with me.

01:11:04.294 --> 01:11:08.131
- Ha, no one's safe.

01:11:11.234 --> 01:11:13.036
- You want to take a hot shower?

01:11:13.036 --> 01:11:14.504
- Uh, no, I don't think so.

01:11:14.504 --> 01:11:15.672
I think I'm gonna go home.

01:11:15.672 --> 01:11:17.106
- Oh, don't go home, Jane.

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.207
Please, don't go.

01:11:20.076 --> 01:11:21.077
- Oh, score!

01:11:23.179 --> 01:11:24.414
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:11:24.414 --> 01:11:25.682
God, you shouldn't
have seen that.

01:11:25.682 --> 01:11:26.716
That's my roommate's.

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:29.653
- Oh, I've been dying for a hit.

01:11:29.653 --> 01:11:31.521
- I can't, I can't
let you do that.

01:11:31.521 --> 01:11:32.689
I'm sorry.
- What?

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:37.427
Well, I can find my own weed.

01:11:38.595 --> 01:11:42.231
But if you'd like, we
can smoke here together.

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:44.368
- Oh, that's really
manipulative.

01:11:47.270 --> 01:11:48.972
- Jane, I can't
watch you get high.

01:11:50.374 --> 01:11:52.742
I'd rather let you leave
than watch you hurt yourself.

01:11:54.110 --> 01:11:55.612
- Hurt myself?

01:11:55.612 --> 01:11:57.313
- Yeah, you smoke pot,
you're gonna drink again,

01:11:57.313 --> 01:11:58.582
and if you drink again,

01:11:58.582 --> 01:11:59.883
you're gonna start
taking those pills.

01:11:59.883 --> 01:12:01.585
It's a vicious cycle.

01:12:01.585 --> 01:12:04.888
So, I'd rather you stayed sober,

01:12:04.888 --> 01:12:07.591
even if it meant that I
never got to see you again.

01:12:13.597 --> 01:12:15.432
Do you want to watch
a movie instead?

01:12:18.635 --> 01:12:19.669
- Yeah.

01:12:21.438 --> 01:12:23.272
- My roommate's not home.

01:12:23.272 --> 01:12:25.509
(laughing)

01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:35.018
- Wow, you really
do share a room.

01:12:35.018 --> 01:12:36.820
- Yeah, I think the maid came.

01:12:39.489 --> 01:12:43.827
- Hey, this is really,
this is really tight.

01:12:43.827 --> 01:12:44.861
- I know.

01:12:44.861 --> 01:12:46.095
- I know.

01:12:46.095 --> 01:12:46.530
- Want me to help
you take it off?

01:12:47.664 --> 01:12:49.132
I can help you.

01:12:49.132 --> 01:12:50.333
I've done it before, I've done
it a million times before.

01:12:50.333 --> 01:12:51.200
It's no big deal, I'll do it.

01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:52.469
- Okay, yeah.

01:12:52.469 --> 01:12:53.937
But just halfway, halfway,

01:12:53.937 --> 01:12:55.839
'cause the bathing
suit's gonna come off.

01:12:55.839 --> 01:12:57.373
- You want to hold
the bathing suit down?

01:12:57.373 --> 01:12:58.675
- Yeah, I'm gonna hold it.
- Okay, I'll do it from.

01:12:58.675 --> 01:12:59.809
I'll do it from behind.

01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.045
Okay, you ready?

01:13:02.045 --> 01:13:02.912
- Okay.
- Ready?

01:13:02.912 --> 01:13:03.713
- Yep.
- Here we go.

01:13:04.814 --> 01:13:07.083
- Oh okay, hold on, hold on.

01:13:07.083 --> 01:13:09.419
I gotta put up my hands.

01:13:09.419 --> 01:13:12.055
Oh, oh, I'm stuck!

01:13:12.055 --> 01:13:13.389
- Wait, hold on.

01:13:14.558 --> 01:13:15.425
- I'm stuck!

01:13:15.425 --> 01:13:17.527
What are you doing?

01:13:17.527 --> 01:13:19.429
Don't do that.

01:13:19.429 --> 01:13:21.097
- Do you like that?

01:13:21.097 --> 01:13:24.768
- I don't like it,
it hurts right now.

01:13:24.768 --> 01:13:25.935
- Okay, ready?

01:13:28.772 --> 01:13:31.374
- One more time, one more time.

01:13:33.276 --> 01:13:35.178
(Jane shouting)

01:13:35.178 --> 01:13:36.446
- I'm so sorry!

01:13:37.814 --> 01:13:38.848
It's gonna hurt.

01:13:38.848 --> 01:13:40.383
You do it, you do it, you do it.

01:13:40.383 --> 01:13:41.651
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:43.052
- Oh!
- Oh my god.

01:13:45.889 --> 01:13:46.723
I'm sorry.

01:13:48.758 --> 01:13:50.026
- Ow!

01:13:50.026 --> 01:13:51.795
- We should make a
porno after this.

01:13:51.795 --> 01:13:52.629
I'm just kidding.

01:13:52.629 --> 01:13:53.463
Oh, I'm sorry!

01:13:53.463 --> 01:13:54.531
Okay, I'm such a klutz.

01:13:54.531 --> 01:13:55.799
Here, sit down on my bed.

01:13:55.799 --> 01:13:57.233
It's the only safe
place in the room.

01:13:57.233 --> 01:14:00.236
I swear to God, it's the
only safe place in this room.

01:14:00.236 --> 01:14:03.540
I am a klutz and you're perfect.

01:14:03.540 --> 01:14:06.510
Just, you don't even have to
lay down if you don't want to.

01:14:06.510 --> 01:14:08.177
Do you want me to
get you something?

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:09.412
- Can I have a shirt, maybe?

01:14:09.412 --> 01:14:10.747
- Yeah, you can have
one of my shirts.

01:14:12.148 --> 01:14:14.050
-  It
was you and your flapping jaw

01:14:14.050 --> 01:14:16.686
that got Jesse into this mess.

01:14:16.686 --> 01:14:19.689
(upbeat rock music)

01:14:41.511 --> 01:14:42.411
- I'm gonna talk to you
about something serious.

01:14:43.780 --> 01:14:46.650
I started taking classes
because I hate my job,

01:14:46.650 --> 01:14:48.618
and I want to be a teacher.

01:14:48.618 --> 01:14:50.419
I want to be a
kindergarten teacher.

01:14:51.788 --> 01:14:54.390
- Oh my god, that's exactly,

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:57.260
that is the perfect job for you.

01:14:57.260 --> 01:14:58.962
That's so good, Jane.

01:14:58.962 --> 01:15:00.730
You're gonna be the best
kindergarten teacher.

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.365
Those little kids are gonna be,

01:15:02.365 --> 01:15:06.235
oh, they're all gonna fall in
love with you just like I did.

01:15:12.375 --> 01:15:13.977
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:13.977 --> 01:15:14.978
- You love me?

01:15:16.279 --> 01:15:18.214
- Yeah, Jane, I love you.

01:15:22.018 --> 01:15:22.986
Do you love me?

01:15:30.193 --> 01:15:31.027
(Fishbone sighs)

01:15:31.027 --> 01:15:33.429
Hey man, ta-da!

01:15:33.429 --> 01:15:34.263
- What'd you do?

01:15:35.364 --> 01:15:37.701
- Things are looking up, Fish.
- Nice!

01:15:38.602 --> 01:15:39.836
Yes, they are.

01:15:39.836 --> 01:15:41.070
You got a beautiful girlfriend,

01:15:41.070 --> 01:15:45.441
and I got three boxes
of cereal. (laughs)

01:15:45.441 --> 01:15:46.576
Hey, are you gonna move out?

01:15:48.011 --> 01:15:50.914
- Eventually, right?

01:15:50.914 --> 01:15:54.083
I mean, we, you knew this
was temporary, right?

01:15:54.083 --> 01:15:56.620
- I most certainly did not
know this was temporary.

01:15:56.620 --> 01:15:58.688
I was, I was committed to this.

01:15:58.688 --> 01:16:01.057
I thought we were
bro-ing together.

01:16:01.057 --> 01:16:03.593
Like bros do, they bro together.

01:16:03.593 --> 01:16:05.361
They don't bro apart.

01:16:05.361 --> 01:16:06.429
- You don't need me here.

01:16:06.429 --> 01:16:07.864
You don't want me here.

01:16:07.864 --> 01:16:10.233
I'm like a grand piano
chained to your waist, dude.

01:16:10.233 --> 01:16:12.602
You're gonna be fine,
you're gonna be great.

01:16:12.602 --> 01:16:14.270
Thank you though,
for everything.

01:16:15.138 --> 01:16:16.072
- You mean that?
- Yes!

01:16:16.072 --> 01:16:17.807
You're gonna be fantastic.

01:16:17.807 --> 01:16:21.144
- So, I'll just be here
bro-ing by myself, okay.

01:16:21.144 --> 01:16:24.113
- Okay, I'm gonna read, okay?

01:16:24.113 --> 01:16:27.150
- I'll just drink
then, by myself.

01:16:28.384 --> 01:16:29.886
- I love you.
- You're leaving.

01:16:29.886 --> 01:16:31.688
- Dude, I just said I loved you.

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:33.089
I, I, I love you.

01:16:33.089 --> 01:16:34.924
You've been awesome.
- I love you.

01:16:34.924 --> 01:16:35.759
- I'm not leaving
'cause I don't like you.

01:16:35.759 --> 01:16:36.960
We're not breaking up.

01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:37.761
You're my friend,
we're in it for life.

01:16:37.761 --> 01:16:38.962
We're friends forever.

01:16:38.962 --> 01:16:39.796
Friends forever.

01:16:43.066 --> 01:16:47.270
- I love you too, man.
- I know you do.

01:16:47.270 --> 01:16:50.273
(light piano music)

01:17:08.925 --> 01:17:11.327
(Jane sighs)

01:17:21.604 --> 01:17:23.773
- Okay, I have one announcement
before we get started.

01:17:23.773 --> 01:17:27.210
Rose, would you please bring
the candies starting next week?

01:17:27.210 --> 01:17:28.878
- Sure.
- Okay.

01:17:28.878 --> 01:17:32.581
Larry, I appreciated
you bringing the
candy last week but,

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.350
and it was sugar-free,
which was good,

01:17:34.350 --> 01:17:36.185
but whatever made it sugar-free

01:17:36.185 --> 01:17:37.854
also caused it to
be super gassy,

01:17:37.854 --> 01:17:39.422
and somebody in this meeting

01:17:39.422 --> 01:17:41.390
accidentally sharted
their fucking pants.

01:17:41.390 --> 01:17:42.859
So, don't even.

01:17:42.859 --> 01:17:44.427
You know, candy's
important here, Larry.

01:17:44.427 --> 01:17:45.929
I'm telling you,

01:17:45.929 --> 01:17:47.831
I bet there's been 12 people
that have come to this meeting

01:17:47.831 --> 01:17:49.365
'cause they heard
about the candy

01:17:49.365 --> 01:17:50.466
and then they stuck around,

01:17:50.466 --> 01:17:53.903
so, no offense, you're done.

01:17:53.903 --> 01:17:55.604
You're on it, okay.

01:17:55.604 --> 01:17:57.741
All right, who wants to
start the share tonight?

01:17:57.741 --> 01:17:58.674
Rose?

01:17:58.674 --> 01:18:00.276
- I had a bit of a revelation.

01:18:01.444 --> 01:18:05.949
I've been holding onto
the hope that my husband

01:18:05.949 --> 01:18:09.652
would eventually
put down the bottle,

01:18:09.652 --> 01:18:12.455
and remember that he loves me,

01:18:12.455 --> 01:18:17.293
and I'm, I've been so
proud of my sponsee, Jane,

01:18:17.293 --> 01:18:18.995
and how she's been
actually taking

01:18:18.995 --> 01:18:21.030
some steps in getting
her life together,

01:18:21.030 --> 01:18:26.035
and I realized that
I can't control them.

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:32.308
I looked in the
mirror yesterday and--

01:18:32.308 --> 01:18:35.945
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

01:18:35.945 --> 01:18:37.613
- I'm pregnant.
- Oh.

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:41.617
- Who's the father?

01:18:44.153 --> 01:18:45.654
- You son of a bitch!

01:18:45.654 --> 01:18:48.191
You told me we couldn't
get pregnant in the water!

01:18:49.225 --> 01:18:50.760
- Oh no.
- That guy's brain dead.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:52.862
Of course you can get
pregnant in the water.

01:18:52.862 --> 01:18:53.863
- Holy shit!

01:18:55.298 --> 01:18:56.800
- I'm a father.

01:18:56.800 --> 01:18:59.035
That's the greatest thing
that's ever happened to me.

01:18:59.035 --> 01:19:00.269
- Oh, fuck my life!

01:19:00.269 --> 01:19:01.504
- Oh baby, I'll
take care of you.

01:19:01.504 --> 01:19:03.139
- Let's get married, Jane.

01:19:03.139 --> 01:19:04.040
Let's get married.

01:19:05.041 --> 01:19:07.476
- What?
- Let's get married.

01:19:08.477 --> 01:19:10.980
- John!
- Marry me.

01:19:10.980 --> 01:19:12.181
- You don't even know me.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:13.950
- I know I love you.

01:19:13.950 --> 01:19:15.751
I'm gonna love you for
the rest of my life.

01:19:15.751 --> 01:19:17.220
You're the mother of my child.

01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.589
I felt like I knew you the
second you walked in the room.

01:19:20.589 --> 01:19:22.558
(Jane crying)

01:19:22.558 --> 01:19:23.559
It's okay.

01:19:23.559 --> 01:19:25.995
- You don't even have a ring!

01:19:27.063 --> 01:19:28.164
- I do.

01:19:28.164 --> 01:19:29.132
I do have a ring.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:32.902
It's an octopus.

01:19:32.902 --> 01:19:34.570
- I know it's an octopus.

01:19:34.570 --> 01:19:36.105
- He can't afford a diamond.

01:19:36.105 --> 01:19:37.040
- He can't afford a wife.

01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.507
- Okay, hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:19:38.507 --> 01:19:39.375
Like, stop!

01:19:39.375 --> 01:19:41.410
Stop!

01:19:41.410 --> 01:19:43.579
This isn't meeting
appropriate, number one.

01:19:43.579 --> 01:19:46.049
Number two, who gives a
shit about the ring, right?

01:19:46.049 --> 01:19:47.583
You guys are having a baby.

01:19:47.583 --> 01:19:51.120
It's grow up time for
both of you guys, okay?

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:54.190
Alcoholics are the
most narcissistic,

01:19:54.190 --> 01:19:57.260
self-centered people
on the planet.

01:19:57.260 --> 01:19:58.995
You guys, seriously.

01:19:58.995 --> 01:20:03.332
Your life is over as
you know it, all right?

01:20:03.332 --> 01:20:04.167
Effective now.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:16.712
- Be my wife.

01:20:23.987 --> 01:20:25.354
Say yes.

01:20:25.354 --> 01:20:28.291
(light rock music)
