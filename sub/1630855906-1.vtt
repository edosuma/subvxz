00:51.708 --> 00:56.322
The origin of the word
"psychology" is greek.

00:56.322 --> 00:59.977
It means science of the soul.

01:01.936 --> 01:07.072
A new form of medicine that seeks
to explain the phenomena of the mind,

01:08.856 --> 01:12.381
a much-misunderstood part
of the human body,

01:12.381 --> 01:16.168
which for some has greatly
compounded their suffering.

03:25.122 --> 03:28.996
You can leave that right there.
Thank you.

03:28.996 --> 03:31.390
- Gracias.
- Thank you so much.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.397
Excuse me?

03:38.397 --> 03:40.529
Excuse me!

03:40.529 --> 03:43.184
You're from the Marquez Ranch?

03:45.317 --> 03:49.798
Dear Isabella,
your son's case is intriguing.

03:49.798 --> 03:52.628
I'm eager to learn more.

03:52.628 --> 03:56.719
I believe the abnormalities
to be related to the mind, not
the body.

03:57.764 --> 04:00.070
I would like to come in person.

04:00.070 --> 04:03.204
With proper time
and the latest in mental science,

04:03.204 --> 04:08.775
I am confident that we can come
to understand his peculiar intellect

04:08.775 --> 04:12.039
and integrate your son
back into society.

04:13.258 --> 04:15.999
I look forward to meeting you.

04:15.999 --> 04:17.740
Grace.

04:54.516 --> 04:56.301
Maria!

05:06.006 --> 05:08.661
Doctor Grace Victoria Burnham.

05:08.661 --> 05:11.533
- Pleased to meet you.
- I am Maria.

05:11.533 --> 05:13.579
- You are here to save us?
- Shh!

05:14.971 --> 05:17.322
How was your trip?

05:17.322 --> 05:20.194
Very agreeable.
Thank you.

05:20.194 --> 05:23.197
Come, I'll show you
to your room.

05:27.201 --> 05:32.032
I would like to see the boy
as soon as possible. Is he still
awake?

05:32.032 --> 05:34.948
It is best to see the Don first.

05:36.515 --> 05:39.561
Temo will come with your things.

05:39.561 --> 05:42.521
Very good.
Shall I meet Isabella then?

05:42.521 --> 05:45.045
You should speak to
the Don first.

06:16.250 --> 06:20.559
Señor Marquez, it's a pleasure
to finally make your acquaintance.

06:21.647 --> 06:23.518
Señora...

06:27.783 --> 06:31.091
I am Doctor Burnham.

06:31.091 --> 06:32.397
Hmm.

06:34.355 --> 06:36.270
I see.

06:38.881 --> 06:42.363
Temo will return you
to the station tomorrow.

06:42.363 --> 06:45.366
- We have no need of a nurse.
- Excuse me?

06:45.366 --> 06:48.063
I'm sorry you came all this way.

06:49.370 --> 06:53.461
Come.

06:57.073 --> 07:01.295
If there is a sick patient in
this home,
I will see to him.

07:02.514 --> 07:05.168
No matter how ignorant
his father is.

07:24.405 --> 07:27.016
You may see the boy tonight.

07:45.600 --> 07:48.168
I'm sorry for that.

07:48.168 --> 07:53.303
It's a bitter man who puts his prejudices
before the welfare of his own child.

07:54.479 --> 07:57.873
- He has good reason.
- Is that so?

07:57.873 --> 08:01.616
He doesn't seem
like a man moved by reason.

08:02.530 --> 08:05.751
I'm assuming
it was Isabella who taught the boy.

08:05.751 --> 08:08.623
Martín taught himself.

08:15.325 --> 08:18.981
- You keep him like this?
- It is best.

08:36.869 --> 08:40.741
It's all right.
This is Doctor Burnham.

08:47.575 --> 08:50.839
Look, Martín.
She's from Nueva York.

08:51.840 --> 08:55.670
- It's a pleasure to meet you.
- Your music was lovely.

08:56.758 --> 08:59.369
Was that Paganini?

09:00.719 --> 09:02.938
May I sit?

09:05.332 --> 09:07.421
Thank you, Martín.

09:12.600 --> 09:16.604
Father Antonio,
thank you, but you may leave us now.

09:16.604 --> 09:19.607
I'm sorry, Señora, I must stay.

09:23.176 --> 09:25.352
Can you read to me?

09:36.276 --> 09:41.455
Yes. But first,
I'd like to ask you some questions.

09:41.455 --> 09:43.979
Would that be all right?

09:47.679 --> 09:52.379
- And do you like cowboys?
- They're called gauchos here or vaqueros.

09:52.379 --> 09:54.903
That's what I'm going to be.

09:57.732 --> 09:59.952
You are quite the enthusiast.

10:00.822 --> 10:03.956
You'd make Buffalo
Bill very proud.

10:06.088 --> 10:09.048
You've been as well to a show?

10:09.048 --> 10:11.180
I have.

10:11.180 --> 10:14.183
During the World's
Fair in Chicago.

10:15.445 --> 10:17.534
You're very lucky.

10:18.666 --> 10:22.801
Mama says Buffalo Bill
is almost a good cowboy as papá.

10:22.801 --> 10:24.672
I'm sure she's right.

10:24.672 --> 10:27.544
Did she buy you all these books?

10:28.328 --> 10:30.635
Some.

10:30.635 --> 10:33.768
But she won't buy
any more books for me.

10:33.768 --> 10:36.510
And why is that?

10:36.510 --> 10:39.078
Because I killed her.

10:54.963 --> 10:56.486
Martín...

10:57.531 --> 10:59.794
Can you tell me what happened?

11:04.756 --> 11:06.714
Martín?

11:08.281 --> 11:10.413
Would you like me to
read to you now?

11:45.274 --> 11:47.712
Isabella, no!

11:51.759 --> 11:53.674
Martín!

11:54.153 --> 11:55.894
Martín!

11:57.765 --> 12:02.552
Why have you allowed him
to perpetuate this idea that he
killed his mother?

12:02.552 --> 12:04.119
Because that is what happened.

12:08.645 --> 12:10.996
He's always been like this.

12:10.996 --> 12:14.390
The very day Martín was born,
that's when the locusts came.

12:14.390 --> 12:16.610
It is like "Exodus 10".

12:16.610 --> 12:19.352
"The Lord sent a plague onto Egypt,
and that plague was death."

12:19.352 --> 12:21.658
Father Antonio...

12:22.094 --> 12:26.098
before we begin Martín's
treatment,
let me be clear.

12:26.098 --> 12:30.015
We are dealing with a disorder.
A disease of the mind.

12:30.015 --> 12:33.018
Religion is not a factor.

12:33.018 --> 12:36.717
It is a matter of science
and we'll solve it as one.

12:38.719 --> 12:40.416
Sí, señora.

13:42.261 --> 13:46.134
If we say we have no sin,

13:46.134 --> 13:51.705
we deceive ourselves,
and the truth is not in us.

13:51.705 --> 13:54.490
And who decides what is a sin?

13:54.490 --> 13:59.147
Martín, I would like to visit
your mother's grave.

13:59.974 --> 14:01.976
Would you mind taking me?

14:02.063 --> 14:04.718
It's better if we stay
in the hacienda.

14:04.805 --> 14:07.416
No! She should see my mother.

14:09.679 --> 14:11.725
It's not safe.

14:13.509 --> 14:15.685
I will take you.

14:23.868 --> 14:26.131
Do you miss your mother?

14:28.742 --> 14:31.136
Shall we pray, Martín?

14:50.938 --> 14:53.071
Father Antonio.

15:02.645 --> 15:04.430
Padre Gavira.

15:16.790 --> 15:19.401
- That is quite enough!
- Grace.

15:21.099 --> 15:23.057
You're scaring him.

15:35.548 --> 15:37.245
He is a child.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.045
Martín, no!

16:01.139 --> 16:04.969
- Martín, come! Come!

16:15.327 --> 16:17.546
Go, Grace!

16:19.418 --> 16:22.987
We'll get the demon later!
We purify the Jesuit's soul.

16:47.228 --> 16:49.230
What have they done?

16:49.230 --> 16:52.277
Hold this. I need my bag.

16:54.844 --> 16:56.933
My bag. Now.

17:10.512 --> 17:12.645
I need clean bandages.

17:22.611 --> 17:27.225
What was that Temo said?
Satch-ak?

17:29.792 --> 17:35.015
Sach'aqa.
It's Quechua, it means
"savages".

17:42.240 --> 17:45.765
Gavira came
when Martín was only months old.

17:46.331 --> 17:49.247
The Lord had spoken to him.

17:49.247 --> 17:55.470
He said we had to exorcise Martín
to get the devil out of him.

17:55.470 --> 17:57.777
I refused.

17:57.777 --> 18:01.955
And now they blame Martín
for everything bad that happens here.

18:04.523 --> 18:06.177
You were right.

18:09.484 --> 18:12.008
They say Martín is evil.

18:14.881 --> 18:16.752
Maybe he is.

19:02.668 --> 19:06.324
- I was praying for you.
- Do you know who that is?

19:10.850 --> 19:14.332
- Satan.
- He was once God's favourite angel.

19:16.290 --> 19:19.685
But he wanted to be like God
so he was cast out of heaven.

19:21.991 --> 19:24.907
Satan hides in our world...

19:26.082 --> 19:28.389
until regains his strength.

19:28.911 --> 19:31.436
Then he will rise again
and wage his final war.

19:31.436 --> 19:35.570
Martín, would you warm
some water for me, please?

19:35.570 --> 19:38.094
Sí, señora.

19:38.094 --> 19:42.925
- Do you actually believe those
things?
- It's the word of God.

19:45.624 --> 19:48.279
But I won't be
of much help in their great war,

19:50.759 --> 19:52.674
because I am weak.

19:52.674 --> 19:55.111
You don't have to tell me.

19:55.199 --> 19:58.767
Gavira broke me with
just a few lashes.

19:58.767 --> 20:01.379
I confessed everything he asked.

20:04.643 --> 20:07.776
"Is the boy in league with
Lucifer?"
"Yes."

20:07.776 --> 20:11.258
"Did he conspire
to bring famine to this valley?"
"Yes."

20:28.754 --> 20:30.451
Don Marquez!

20:32.453 --> 20:35.021
This is no place for your son.

20:36.805 --> 20:39.025
I think you know that.

20:44.987 --> 20:46.685
Can you hear me?

20:47.512 --> 20:51.777
He died this morning.
Half of my herd is already afflicted.

21:01.656 --> 21:03.832
Unquy llaqta utaq.

21:06.095 --> 21:11.100
The animals in the village
are sick as well. They will
blame Martín.

21:11.100 --> 21:14.582
Well, you must leave.
You've got to go to someplace safe.

21:14.582 --> 21:16.584
You can leave if you want.

22:26.350 --> 22:28.743
That was very nice of you, Martín.

22:41.713 --> 22:43.454
Señora.

22:45.151 --> 22:47.849
I see you are still here.
- I am.

22:49.460 --> 22:52.724
So you think you can still heal,
Martín?

22:53.333 --> 22:55.248
Of course.

22:56.031 --> 22:57.642
Hmm.

23:04.910 --> 23:10.350
Let me tell you about Martíne's
sister.
She was stillborn.

23:11.960 --> 23:13.832
I'm sorry.

23:15.703 --> 23:18.924
No, she wasn't...

23:39.466 --> 23:43.035
- !¡Nicolás! Déjame verla.
- I wanted her buried with the family.

23:43.035 --> 23:44.558
Nicolás!

23:44.558 --> 23:47.256
But Father Gavira
wouldn't allow it.

23:47.256 --> 23:52.523
She wasn't baptised,
so I buried her by the stream.

23:54.089 --> 23:57.223
- I see.
- No, you don't.

23:58.790 --> 24:02.707
Martín didn't like
the sound of his mother crying,

24:04.448 --> 24:06.928
so he tried to make her stop.

24:22.944 --> 24:26.426
No! No!

24:26.426 --> 24:29.473
- No!
- Martín!

24:34.086 --> 24:36.262
Who would do
something like that?

24:39.874 --> 24:45.532
I believe that Martín has what
John Langdon Down called "savant
syndrome".

24:45.532 --> 24:47.621
It's a disorder.

24:47.621 --> 24:51.190
It is modern medicine
that will help Martín.

24:51.190 --> 24:55.673
Not priests or myths
or delusions of omens.

25:05.117 --> 25:07.641
There is always an explanation.

26:37.035 --> 26:38.950
Father Gavira!

26:39.820 --> 26:42.257
I'm...

26:42.257 --> 26:44.303
I'm so sorry.

26:45.652 --> 26:47.741
What happened?

26:47.741 --> 26:50.048
- You're arrogant to come here.
- I came to make peace.

26:51.440 --> 26:54.182
And to help you understand.

26:54.182 --> 26:57.490
See, Martín isn't like
other children.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.971
He's got a sort of sickness.

27:00.928 --> 27:04.802
See, I am an alienist, a doctor.

27:04.802 --> 27:10.285
And I treat patients like Martín
who are alienated from their
human nature.

27:11.939 --> 27:15.029
I baptised
this boy when he was only days old.

27:15.029 --> 27:17.510
I look in his father's eyes,

27:17.510 --> 27:21.296
and I ask him to let me hold
this baby's head under the water.

27:21.296 --> 27:24.952
- He trust me, and I failed him.
- No.

27:24.952 --> 27:28.826
The Lord sent me
a warning when Martín was born.

27:30.262 --> 27:34.962
- I didn't listen.
- Martín is different. But he's
no demon.

27:34.962 --> 27:37.486
Satan disguised
himself as an angel.

27:38.270 --> 27:42.666
Martín has a condition,
an illness.

27:42.666 --> 27:46.974
Look, if you just see right here,
you will understand.

27:46.974 --> 27:49.803
It is all right here. Look.

27:50.674 --> 27:52.284
See?

27:52.284 --> 27:55.635
Please. You'll see.

27:58.769 --> 28:02.773
Our book also
has a name for this condition.

28:02.773 --> 28:04.557
El Maligno.

28:06.777 --> 28:08.996
I'm no child you can scare.

28:09.431 --> 28:13.261
No fue Adán
quien fue engañado, sino una
mujer llamada Eva.

28:13.261 --> 28:15.263
Amen!

28:25.230 --> 28:30.322
- !¡Malditos! !Bruja!
- Get off of me! Let me go! Let
me go!

28:30.322 --> 28:34.500
- Let me go!
- !¡Bruja!

28:34.500 --> 28:37.416
Get off of me! Get off of me!

28:37.416 --> 28:40.027
- Let me go!

28:40.027 --> 28:45.511
Get off of me!

28:53.258 --> 28:55.651
You will confess?

28:58.872 --> 29:01.005
I do this to save you.

29:04.182 --> 29:06.140
Bastard.

29:06.140 --> 29:08.273
You bastards!

29:12.799 --> 29:14.409
Andrés.

32:10.977 --> 32:12.718
Fourteen.

32:14.502 --> 32:16.852
Fourteen qué?

32:17.897 --> 32:22.858
You'll have to slaughter
fourteen head.
Better do it now before they starve.

33:09.905 --> 33:13.431
There is no right or wrong answer.
All right?

33:14.562 --> 33:16.782
What do you see?

33:20.264 --> 33:23.484
- There is nothing.
- Really?

33:24.181 --> 33:29.055
This inkblot was made by
Justinus Kerner,
a German physician.

33:29.055 --> 33:31.144
Like you.

33:33.016 --> 33:37.020
He was also a poet,
inspired by this very picture.

33:37.020 --> 33:39.196
So, tell me, Martín...

33:41.024 --> 33:43.200
do you still see nothing?

33:44.114 --> 33:46.333
That's not a shape.

33:51.164 --> 33:56.735
I see a lake in the mountains
because it reminds me of home.

33:58.911 --> 34:01.392
Does it remind you of anything?

34:02.480 --> 34:04.830
Anything at all.

34:26.677 --> 34:28.548
Perhaps I see a butterfly.

34:31.335 --> 34:33.076
Very well.

34:37.297 --> 34:39.385
How about this one?

34:40.952 --> 34:43.738
What do you see?

34:43.738 --> 34:46.132
I see a moth.

34:58.405 --> 35:02.714
- Everything all right, Father?
- I can't
remember the last time I've seen rain.

35:08.198 --> 35:11.157
You really seem
to have made a connection.

35:11.723 --> 35:13.725
If I may...

35:14.552 --> 35:16.815
what do you see in him?

35:20.210 --> 35:24.127
I see a boy born with
special abilities.

35:25.476 --> 35:29.262
Music, mathematics, language.

35:29.262 --> 35:35.747
A boy born with the ability to
access parts
of the brain that others don't
even know exist.

35:36.574 --> 35:38.793
A boy touched by God.

35:40.186 --> 35:42.580
That's one way to say it.

35:45.670 --> 35:47.846
What else?

35:51.980 --> 35:55.375
I see a... confused,

35:56.202 --> 35:58.900
lost child

35:58.900 --> 36:01.120
with no place in this world,

36:02.295 --> 36:05.951
born incapable of normal
social behaviour.

36:07.170 --> 36:09.259
Incapable of empathy.

36:12.218 --> 36:14.438
And do you believe you
can cure him?

36:18.006 --> 36:19.747
No.

36:22.054 --> 36:28.147
But I can help Martín
imagine what it's like to feel

36:28.147 --> 36:30.323
what other people are feeling.

36:31.194 --> 36:33.935
I believe that only God can
change, Martín.

36:43.423 --> 36:45.556
But who knows, Grace?

36:46.861 --> 36:49.560
Perhaps he works through you.

37:21.983 --> 37:23.811
Not yet.

37:28.816 --> 37:30.601
Thank you.

37:34.779 --> 37:37.216
I didn't know you were
waiting for me.

37:37.216 --> 37:41.568
It would be nice to eat together,
as a family would.

37:42.352 --> 37:47.357
!¡Claro!
It's nice to have a woman at our
table again.

37:47.357 --> 37:50.838
- Thank you, Don Marquez.
- Nicolás, please.

37:52.405 --> 37:55.408
The east field is ready
to be replanted.

37:56.888 --> 37:58.890
Wheat will grow there now.

38:05.897 --> 38:10.771
"The dusty cowboy rode
into town astride his giant
black steed."

38:12.033 --> 38:16.821
"Outnumbered and surrounded,
he faced down the cattle
rustlers."

38:16.821 --> 38:21.173
"His wife, still in the grips
of these bandits, called out,

38:21.173 --> 38:25.743
'William, run! Save yourself!'."

38:25.743 --> 38:29.573
"But Bill Cody would do
no such thing."

38:29.573 --> 38:34.839
"He drew his two Colt revolvers
and galloped into the bandits."

38:34.839 --> 38:42.020
"And when the dust settled,
there was only one man still set
atop his horse."

38:42.020 --> 38:46.633
"The West's most wild cowboy,
a true gaucho."

38:47.634 --> 38:50.942
- Like my father.
- Like your father.

38:51.856 --> 38:53.814
Now it's bedtime.

38:56.774 --> 38:58.341
Good night.

39:27.892 --> 39:30.547
You know this is
just loneliness.

39:32.026 --> 39:34.681
You know that, right?

39:34.681 --> 39:36.814
Maybe.

41:24.095 --> 41:26.097
You keep the boy inside.

41:27.968 --> 41:32.016
No, that's wrong.
He's supposed to say the
benediction next.

41:32.843 --> 41:37.108
Fear not, for I have redeemed you.
I have called you by name, you
are mine.

41:37.108 --> 41:39.197
- You are mine, you are mine.
- Martín. Martín.

42:06.703 --> 42:08.531
Martín, I need you...

42:39.953 --> 42:44.828
So, Martín, I need to go help.

42:44.828 --> 42:49.528
Will you stay here for me?
Please? All right?

43:08.634 --> 43:12.725
- Nicolás! Where's Nicolás?
- He went inside.

43:17.643 --> 43:19.340
Nicolás!

43:19.340 --> 43:21.081
No!

43:21.081 --> 43:23.954
Nicolás! Nicolás!

43:24.824 --> 43:27.871
Nicolás! Nicolás!

43:50.154 --> 43:51.721
No!

44:54.914 --> 44:57.134
Martín. Martín.

44:58.265 --> 45:00.746
Get up now, and
follow me outside.

45:00.877 --> 45:02.792
Hurry!

45:05.795 --> 45:07.492
Temo!

45:08.711 --> 45:10.930
Antonio!

45:16.370 --> 45:18.285
Stay here.

45:31.472 --> 45:33.431
Go! Go!

46:31.532 --> 46:33.621
Nicolás...

46:38.365 --> 46:40.193
Martín...

46:42.805 --> 46:44.676
The fire, he...

46:48.985 --> 46:53.467
Yesterday, in the field,
Martín took my hand.

47:06.611 --> 47:08.743
You'll need stitches.

47:11.007 --> 47:13.009
Later.

48:51.020 --> 48:52.978
I saw something.

48:55.067 --> 48:57.417
During the fire.

48:59.550 --> 49:04.120
Something... impossible.

49:09.690 --> 49:11.257
If I...

49:12.345 --> 49:14.565
If my reason...

49:17.350 --> 49:24.183
If I of all people
can't see Martín without prejudice,

49:27.273 --> 49:30.233
then how am I to help him?

49:31.843 --> 49:36.239
God works through us.
It is by his hand you came here.

49:38.589 --> 49:40.852
God didn't send me, Father.

49:42.941 --> 49:47.815
If he exists,
God abandoned us a long time ago.

49:57.956 --> 50:00.350
Do you know what "grace" means?

50:02.004 --> 50:07.966
Grace is when... God reaches out
to us
in moments when we want nothing
to do with him.

50:07.966 --> 50:12.405
When he puts his faith in us,
even when we've lost it in ourselves.

50:14.538 --> 50:16.366
What I'm trying to say

50:16.366 --> 50:21.501
is that perhaps it is you
we needed here in this hour of darkness.

50:21.501 --> 50:25.897
Not in spite of your beliefs,
but because of them.

50:38.127 --> 50:42.044
Good morning.
Good morning.

50:46.265 --> 50:47.745
Martín...

50:48.659 --> 50:50.748
Look at me.

50:52.532 --> 50:57.494
Martín, it's time for
our morning talk.

51:01.324 --> 51:05.110
Papá should plant amaranth
in the east field.

51:05.110 --> 51:07.025
Is that so?

51:07.025 --> 51:11.508
Amaranth is more tolerant
to blight and drought. We had
both this year.

51:13.031 --> 51:16.295
All right. We'll tell
him tonight.

51:17.209 --> 51:19.864
We should tell
the other farmers in the
village, too.

51:19.864 --> 51:22.388
And why would you
like to do that?

51:24.042 --> 51:26.827
So they don't burn
our house down.

51:26.827 --> 51:28.960
Only that?

51:29.917 --> 51:34.922
Or could it be that you also
don't
want them to go hungry? - No,
only that.

51:38.012 --> 51:42.321
Why do you think that they burned
down your stables? - To punish me.

51:43.540 --> 51:45.498
- Why?
- Because I killed their crops.

51:46.978 --> 51:50.808
Martín, did you kill
their crops?

51:50.808 --> 51:54.768
Did you sneak out in the middle
of the night and release the
locusts?

51:54.768 --> 51:57.075
Maybe.

51:57.075 --> 52:02.646
And did you also cast a spell
on their animals and make them
sick and die?

52:02.646 --> 52:05.518
- Martín, did you?
- No.

52:05.518 --> 52:09.783
- Well, then it can't be true,
can it?
- What about the man last night?

52:10.958 --> 52:16.442
Hey, Martín, you did
nothing to him.

52:16.442 --> 52:19.489
You didn't do anything.

52:19.489 --> 52:21.665
Do you hear me?

52:21.665 --> 52:24.450
He started a fire and
it killed him.

52:27.497 --> 52:30.064
That's what happened.

52:30.064 --> 52:35.200
Martín,
those people are scared, all
right?

52:35.200 --> 52:37.463
They're scared, and they
need something to blame for that fear,

52:37.463 --> 52:42.207
and it's going to be you,
because you are different.

52:42.207 --> 52:44.209
All right?

52:44.992 --> 52:47.081
Do you understand me?

52:49.954 --> 52:51.782
Yes.

53:26.730 --> 53:28.862
How's Martín?

53:30.908 --> 53:33.215
He understands what happened.

53:34.781 --> 53:36.914
He blames himself.

53:38.829 --> 53:40.831
What can I do?

53:42.136 --> 53:44.182
Treat him like a son.

53:46.228 --> 53:48.360
Love him...

53:49.274 --> 53:51.015
without judgement.

53:53.060 --> 53:56.455
He mentioned planting amaranth.
Perhaps you could take him back
with you.

53:56.455 --> 53:58.457
No.

53:58.457 --> 54:02.679
But he needs that. He needs
to spend time with you, working
in the fields.

54:02.679 --> 54:05.072
He will work with me.

54:07.945 --> 54:10.643
But we cannot plant
together again.

54:12.863 --> 54:17.650
They've sown my land with salt.
Nothing will grow now.

54:31.185 --> 54:33.971
In the case of common hysteria,

54:34.972 --> 54:40.107
it not infrequently happens
that instead of a single major trauma,

54:40.978 --> 54:47.854
we find a number of partial traumas,
forming a group of provoking causes.

54:49.029 --> 54:55.035
They are components
of a single story of suffering.

55:02.434 --> 55:07.004
We must presume,
then, that the cyclical trauma,

55:07.004 --> 55:11.182
or, more precisely,
the memory of that trauma,

55:12.226 --> 55:15.534
acts as a foreign body

55:17.144 --> 55:18.624
which...

55:20.147 --> 55:26.676
long after its entry must continue
to be regarded as an agent still
at work,

55:27.546 --> 55:31.550
only disappearing once the memory
has been vividly provoked.

55:32.334 --> 55:36.816
The process must be
brought back to its "status
nascendi",

55:38.035 --> 55:40.864
its state of birth.

55:50.134 --> 55:52.179
Can you hear it, Martín?

55:53.746 --> 55:59.796
Each click in rhythm
like the one before and the one after.

56:00.753 --> 56:08.370
Each moment no longer
and no shorter than any other.

56:09.153 --> 56:13.070
Time passing in
perfect symmetry.

56:17.291 --> 56:21.557
I'm going to name a thing, and
you're going
to tell me how it makes you feel.

56:22.819 --> 56:26.779
- Horses.
- I like to ride horses.

56:26.779 --> 56:28.912
But they smell very bad.

56:31.088 --> 56:34.483
- Yellow clovers.
- I hate them.

56:34.483 --> 56:38.312
- Why?
- Because they remind me of Mama.

56:39.313 --> 56:41.272
Tell me about her.

56:45.232 --> 56:51.413
She smelled like lavender
and her hair was the colour of
burnt coffee.

56:51.413 --> 56:55.765
- How did she make you feel?
- Safe.

56:58.071 --> 57:00.813
That sounds very nice.

57:00.813 --> 57:04.208
Why would you dislike
that feeling, Martín?

57:04.208 --> 57:07.994
Because it's a lie.
We're not safe.

57:07.994 --> 57:09.996
We're all going to die
because of me.

57:15.262 --> 57:17.830
- What is your lie?
- What?

57:21.878 --> 57:24.010
What is your lie?

57:27.710 --> 57:33.150
What-is-your-lie?

57:34.368 --> 57:40.592
What is your lie?

57:45.597 --> 57:47.773
That I'm a fraud.

57:49.209 --> 57:54.954
That I repeat the teachings
of great men, but I'm not one of them.

58:00.264 --> 58:05.399
That I'll travel to the edge
of the world to prove myself,
only to fail.

58:25.942 --> 58:27.900
Those aren't lies.

58:33.427 --> 58:35.995
They're fears.

58:54.579 --> 58:57.539
- Temo?
- Uma wakcha kunan.

58:57.669 --> 58:59.628
What is it?

01:00:12.962 --> 01:00:15.051
I believe it to be typhus.

01:00:16.095 --> 01:00:19.446
- Plague.
- It's spread by lice.

01:00:19.446 --> 01:00:23.581
I need you to go inside and burn everything
that she could have touched in
the last few days.

01:00:23.581 --> 01:00:28.107
Linens, blankets, clothing...
Anything that could spread the disease.

01:00:28.107 --> 01:00:30.283
Do you understand?

01:01:40.484 --> 01:01:46.751
Through this Holy Unction of oil
and through the great goodness
of his mercy...

01:02:23.048 --> 01:02:24.746
Nicolás!

01:02:25.616 --> 01:02:27.966
I can't... do this.

01:02:33.885 --> 01:02:37.149
I'm not who you think I am.

01:02:38.063 --> 01:02:39.325
No.

01:02:40.762 --> 01:02:42.372
No.

01:02:43.460 --> 01:02:50.119
I'm a fraud. - For the first time,
I know my son and he knows me.

01:02:51.381 --> 01:02:56.603
This...
This is just science, a disease.

01:02:56.603 --> 01:03:00.477
But what you have done
with my son is a miracle.

01:03:03.001 --> 01:03:04.046
She's gone.

01:03:07.745 --> 01:03:09.660
It's God's will.

01:03:19.452 --> 01:03:24.849
...committed
by evil use of sight, hearing,

01:03:24.849 --> 01:03:28.331
smell, taste and speech, touch,

01:03:29.593 --> 01:03:31.813
ability to walk.

01:03:34.119 --> 01:03:35.817
Amen.

01:05:26.449 --> 01:05:31.323
- Which books would you like me
to pack?
- We won't have room.

01:05:36.763 --> 01:05:40.289
The violin, then. We
must bring this.

01:05:44.423 --> 01:05:46.599
I'm sorry.

01:05:46.599 --> 01:05:49.037
- I'm sorry.
- What?

01:05:49.037 --> 01:05:51.387
I'm sorry.

01:05:51.387 --> 01:05:53.432
I didn't mean to hurt Maria.

01:05:57.001 --> 01:06:00.874
I don't want to leave.
I'll be better, I promise.

01:06:00.874 --> 01:06:04.574
Please. I'll think whatever
you want me to think. I just
want to stay!

01:06:10.884 --> 01:06:14.584
Martín, look at me.

01:06:22.113 --> 01:06:28.598
I can only imagine
how confusing this must be for you.

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:34.343
This is not your fault.

01:06:37.476 --> 01:06:40.914
None of this is your fault.

01:06:44.396 --> 01:06:46.137
None of it.

01:06:48.618 --> 01:06:50.446
Now come help me pack.

01:07:22.695 --> 01:07:24.958
- Padre.
- I'm ready.

01:07:30.486 --> 01:07:32.488
Your things?

01:07:33.619 --> 01:07:35.665
I have all that I need.

01:07:37.232 --> 01:07:39.234
Very good.

01:07:44.195 --> 01:07:49.548
- They're coming for him.
- Martín, come inside. Come.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:55.337
If the worst should happen.

01:07:56.860 --> 01:07:58.427
No.

01:08:00.690 --> 01:08:02.953
They would be cruel.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:40.947
You know what? Martín...

01:08:42.688 --> 01:08:45.778
Why don't you play some music
for me?
I think that would...

01:08:46.649 --> 01:08:50.131
- That would make me feel better.
- Sí, señora.

01:09:35.567 --> 01:09:37.221
Martín!

01:09:46.796 --> 01:09:48.928
Martín...

01:09:50.495 --> 01:09:52.149
Let's go.

01:09:57.328 --> 01:09:59.330
Let's get him to the horses.

01:10:04.988 --> 01:10:06.424
Come!

01:10:19.263 --> 01:10:20.917
Come!

01:10:23.049 --> 01:10:26.662
These take you to the
cold cellar. Here.

01:10:30.970 --> 01:10:32.972
Antonio!

01:10:34.278 --> 01:10:36.411
Good luck, Doctor.

01:12:15.640 --> 01:12:17.686
Nicolás?

01:12:28.479 --> 01:12:30.176
Temo!

01:12:39.185 --> 01:12:42.319
- Mátalo!
- Sach'aqa.

01:12:43.494 --> 01:12:45.582
Yes.

01:12:51.849 --> 01:12:53.852
Sach'aqa.

01:13:00.729 --> 01:13:02.383
Martín.

01:13:22.272 --> 01:13:24.709
Get behind me, Martín!

01:13:24.709 --> 01:13:26.537
Mátalo!

01:13:32.412 --> 01:13:34.763
Martín! No!

01:14:23.899 --> 01:14:26.031
Amen!

01:15:03.460 --> 01:15:05.201
!¡Papá!

01:15:12.425 --> 01:15:16.299
Mátalo! Mátalo! Mátalo!

01:15:16.299 --> 01:15:18.126
!¡Papá!

01:15:19.607 --> 01:15:21.522
!¡Papá!

01:15:23.872 --> 01:15:26.962
Mátalo! Mátalo! Mátalo!

01:15:26.962 --> 01:15:29.138
!¡Papá!

01:15:30.356 --> 01:15:32.662
!¡Papá!

01:15:46.721 --> 01:15:48.679
!¡La mato yo, la bruja!

01:16:06.653 --> 01:16:08.742
Martín!

01:16:24.236 --> 01:16:25.934
!¡Papá!

01:16:31.242 --> 01:16:33.115
!¡Papá!

01:16:33.942 --> 01:16:35.596
!¡Papá!

01:17:55.023 --> 01:17:56.501
Nicolás...

01:18:01.638 --> 01:18:03.640
People...

01:18:05.598 --> 01:18:07.862
They won't understand.

01:18:12.780 --> 01:18:14.999
I killed those men.

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:22.224
That's not what I saw.

01:18:23.573 --> 01:18:28.143
I killed them. That's
what you saw.

01:18:29.013 --> 01:18:31.059
Nothing else.

01:18:38.805 --> 01:18:41.330
What will become of him?

01:18:44.289 --> 01:18:46.421
I will protect him.

01:18:55.910 --> 01:18:57.867
He will be safe...

01:19:00.915 --> 01:19:02.917
and happy.

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:36.559
Martín...

01:19:41.519 --> 01:19:43.957
It's time we take our trip.
