The Ghost Riders, the Wild Hunt.

00:04.672 --> 00:07.101
<i>They come by storm and they take people.</i>

00:07.177 --> 00:08.365
<i>Steigen!</i>

00:08.413 --> 00:10.327
He's a Nazi. He wants
the Hunt for himself.

00:10.375 --> 00:11.703
Everyone from the bunker has been taken.

00:11.750 --> 00:13.101
Everyone?

00:13.741 --> 00:17.117
I have a son. We call him Stiles.
I remember.

00:17.335 --> 00:20.093
If we can bring Stiles back.
We can bring everyone back.

02:23.613 --> 02:25.418
Give the boy some room.

Dad? Dad?

02:32.824 --> 02:34.768
Oh, God.

02:34.816 --> 02:37.582
Oh, I found you.

02:39.613 --> 02:41.129
I can't believe I found you.

02:41.176 --> 02:44.095
Dad, I can hear Lydia.

02:44.276 --> 02:45.375
I think... I think I can get to her.

02:45.380 --> 02:46.996
I think she can get us out of here.

02:51.222 --> 02:54.315
You need to get out of here.
Don't worry about me.

02:54.409 --> 02:56.176
- What, you're kidding, right?
- Go.

02:56.277 --> 02:58.145
Get help. Find your friends.

02:58.246 --> 02:59.989
Yeah, and what about you?

03:02.383 --> 03:04.146
We'll find each other again.

03:07.422 --> 03:09.323
- Dad.
- Stiles...

03:09.424 --> 03:10.524
I'll hold them back.

03:11.069 --> 03:12.606
Now get the hell out of here.

03:12.794 --> 03:14.935
Go. Go!

03:50.865 --> 03:53.258
<i>I can see you, Stiles, don't stop!</i>

04:04.015 --> 04:05.875
Stiles?

04:09.217 --> 04:10.951
Lydia...

04:12.353 --> 04:14.078
Where is he?

04:15.089 --> 04:16.781
It was working.

04:18.358 --> 04:21.514
You saw him, right?

04:21.765 --> 04:23.532
We didn't see anyone.

04:25.066 --> 04:26.133
No.

04:26.554 --> 04:28.514
He was here.

04:28.776 --> 04:30.217
I know it.

04:32.307 --> 04:34.037
Stiles was here.

Liam...

05:31.246 --> 05:33.142
- There's something you need to see.
- You're still here.

05:33.189 --> 05:34.367
But everyone else is gone.

05:34.469 --> 05:35.623
All of them. They're all gone.

05:35.670 --> 05:37.738
- Look, you have to come with me.
- What is it?

05:37.839 --> 05:41.120
I can't explain it.
I have to show you.

05:41.476 --> 05:43.348
Uh, all right. You guys stay here.

05:43.350 --> 05:45.712
Just in case. In case
Stiles Ecomes back?

05:45.813 --> 05:49.172
If there's any hope, you
need to keep trying.

05:52.991 --> 05:55.454
Scott? Scott.

05:57.978 --> 05:59.438
Scott?

06:27.761 --> 06:28.794
What are you doing?

06:28.895 --> 06:30.029
We're gonna go find Stiles.

06:30.130 --> 06:31.970
Scott told us to stay in
case he shows up here.

06:32.032 --> 06:33.866
Stiles isn't coming here.

06:33.945 --> 06:37.205
If he was, he would've, and
he hasn't, so he's not.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.291
You still think it worked, right?

06:39.506 --> 06:40.539
I know I saw him.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.608
And you're never wrong
about these things.

06:42.709 --> 06:44.176
I wouldn't say never.

06:44.675 --> 06:46.176
But right now?

06:46.780 --> 06:48.614
Right now, I'm not wrong.

06:48.715 --> 06:50.749
Stiles is out there. I can feel it.

06:50.851 --> 06:52.518
Then what are we doing standing here?

07:07.949 --> 07:09.902
This is happening everywhere?

07:10.003 --> 07:12.753
Here, the school lacrosse field.

07:18.784 --> 07:20.363
What does this mean?

07:20.468 --> 07:21.935
It means...

07:23.878 --> 07:25.480
It's working.

07:27.368 --> 07:28.911
This looks fresh.

07:29.012 --> 07:31.380
It's from Stiles' Jeep.
It must have just left.

07:31.481 --> 07:32.681
Without his keys?

07:32.782 --> 07:35.551
Well, half the time he got it
started with a screwdriver.

07:36.282 --> 07:38.721
Then he's here. We have to tell Scott.

07:39.122 --> 07:41.756
We should probably tell
Scott about that, too.

08:03.479 --> 08:05.113
He can't take both of us?

08:05.214 --> 08:06.615
No way.

08:06.716 --> 08:08.250
<i>Hollenhund.</i>

08:14.238 --> 08:15.494
Parrish.

08:15.566 --> 08:18.660
Parrish, you don't wanna do this. Stop!

08:18.761 --> 08:20.582
The train is coming, boys.

08:20.676 --> 08:22.864
There's no stopping the Wild Hunt.

08:22.966 --> 08:25.324
You'll make a fine Ghost Rider, Scott.

08:25.935 --> 08:27.669
And I'll have a true Alpha by my side.

08:27.770 --> 08:29.304
Parrish! Stop!

08:30.807 --> 08:33.597
And then a Banshee, a were-coyote...

08:33.727 --> 08:35.128
- A Stiles.
- What?

08:37.638 --> 08:39.260
Bad guy, right? I didn't misread that?

08:39.307 --> 08:41.095
Oh, God!

08:51.242 --> 08:52.475
Oh!

08:54.473 --> 08:55.464
Buddy!

08:55.565 --> 08:57.232
Oh, man!

08:57.333 --> 08:59.564
- Oh, it's so good to see you.
- Hey, hey, hey! Uh...

08:59.612 --> 09:01.867
- Big Liam! It's so good to see you too!
- Yeah, no, yeah!

09:01.914 --> 09:03.805
Good to see you, Stiles. But, uh...

09:05.707 --> 09:07.672
Okay. Yeah, we should go. Go. Go, go.

09:41.210 --> 09:42.437
Why is there a train station

09:42.485 --> 09:44.557
in the middle of the library?

09:45.408 --> 09:48.267
There's also a train
station in the Wild Hunt.

09:48.445 --> 09:50.583
Any chance they're connected?

09:50.721 --> 09:53.478
I would say high. Like 100%.

09:56.206 --> 09:58.336
If there's a train station,

09:58.507 --> 10:01.434
then there's probably a train.

10:01.718 --> 10:05.779
And if there's a train...
It's going to the Wild Hunt.

10:06.077 --> 10:07.279
They're all gonna be taken.

10:07.327 --> 10:08.623
They can't get on that train.

10:08.682 --> 10:10.316
Um...

10:11.287 --> 10:13.284
Okay. Listen up, everybody.

10:13.332 --> 10:14.381
We've all got to get out of here.

10:14.428 --> 10:16.925
We gotta go right now.

10:18.114 --> 10:20.282
It's bad, we have to go!

10:21.818 --> 10:23.552
Hello?

10:23.851 --> 10:26.419
Uh, hello? Sir?

10:30.045 --> 10:32.677
How do we get them to leave
if they can't hear us?

10:32.769 --> 10:34.536
Uh...

10:37.269 --> 10:39.403
Maybe there's someone who can.

10:45.532 --> 10:46.895
Corey?

10:53.999 --> 10:55.466
Corey.

10:57.604 --> 10:59.667
How many rooms does this place have?

10:59.851 --> 11:02.249
Beyond the 57 we've already searched?

11:02.505 --> 11:04.651
Probably enough for all of Beacon Hills.

11:05.714 --> 11:07.484
We're never gonna find him.

11:07.539 --> 11:09.375
Just keep looking.

11:09.447 --> 11:11.008
Attention, all passengers.

11:11.055 --> 11:14.086
<i>The train will be
arriving in 19 minutes.</i>

11:14.376 --> 11:15.681
Okay, we're running out of time.

11:15.762 --> 11:18.519
- Mason. You always know where he is.
- Yeah, except for right now.

11:18.567 --> 11:20.823
But you find him eventually.

11:21.481 --> 11:23.545
Just clear your mind, focus.

11:23.853 --> 11:25.427
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

11:25.579 --> 11:28.715
<i>The train will be
arriving in 19 minutes.</i>

11:31.518 --> 11:33.285
It's him.

11:39.420 --> 11:40.718
Can't believe
I'm gone a couple days,

11:40.765 --> 11:42.014
the whole place falls apart.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.335
No, you were gone for three months.

11:44.383 --> 11:45.617
I was... What?

11:45.683 --> 11:47.844
Okay, if they don't let me
graduate, I swear to God...

11:47.892 --> 11:50.423
- What are you looking for?
- Ah! This.

11:53.758 --> 11:54.887
And him.

11:56.460 --> 11:59.415
Grab him. Grab him now.

12:12.346 --> 12:13.506
Okay.

12:13.511 --> 12:15.528
- God, ow!
- Liam, you're fine.

12:15.606 --> 12:17.606
God, that doesn't feel good. You know?

12:17.692 --> 12:20.052
Stiles? What are you doing here?

12:20.130 --> 12:21.782
Buddy, love you, but we're
way past that, okay?

12:21.829 --> 12:23.372
You gotta fill us in. What's going on?

12:23.420 --> 12:25.496
Douglas... He's merging the worlds

12:25.544 --> 12:27.302
so the Ghost Riders can cross over.

12:27.358 --> 12:29.606
Yeah, he wants his supernatural
army in our world.

12:29.694 --> 12:30.997
How do we stop him?

12:31.075 --> 12:33.966
The train. It's coming.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.833
Okay, and how do we stop that?

12:37.901 --> 12:39.668
You can't stop it.

12:40.005 --> 12:42.571
But you can divert it.

12:54.479 --> 12:56.057
Okay, how the hell do
you "merge worlds?"

12:56.128 --> 12:58.781
Okay, nowhere in the manual does it
say that werewolves can do that.

12:58.828 --> 13:00.420
And Scott and I pretty
much wrote the manual.

13:00.467 --> 13:01.935
We can't even move
between them, all right?

13:01.982 --> 13:03.804
Look what it took to break you out.

13:05.029 --> 13:06.740
We can't move between worlds.

13:06.788 --> 13:08.087
But Corey can.

13:08.135 --> 13:10.032
He can exist in both worlds.

13:10.080 --> 13:11.400
And he can take people with him.

13:11.448 --> 13:14.203
At Scott's house, he pulled a
Ghost Rider into our world.

13:14.263 --> 13:16.548
At the lacrosse game he
brought us into theirs.

13:16.596 --> 13:18.590
What if that's how Douglas is doing it?

13:18.646 --> 13:20.309
What if Corey's the key?

13:20.380 --> 13:22.472
Interesting theory, okay? Solid logic.

13:22.520 --> 13:25.528
It is, but he's in there
and we're out here.

13:25.586 --> 13:27.440
So the only way to save everyone now

13:27.488 --> 13:28.875
is to just divert the train.

13:28.923 --> 13:30.325
We have to find him.

13:30.391 --> 13:31.824
How?

13:33.127 --> 13:34.390
I'm going into the Hunt.

13:34.438 --> 13:36.457
No, no, no. Liam, I
think you're confused,

13:36.505 --> 13:38.442
we're trying to get
people out of the Hunt.

13:38.505 --> 13:40.186
He can get taken by a Ghost Rider.

13:40.234 --> 13:41.931
It's just... That's not
a pleasant option.

13:41.979 --> 13:43.356
I'm speaking from experience.

13:43.404 --> 13:46.051
I don't need to get
taken to get into the Hunt.

13:46.107 --> 13:48.204
Okay. Seems like you got
an idea, let's disc...

13:48.255 --> 13:50.443
Where are you going? I'll be back.

13:50.514 --> 13:52.281
Were we like that?

13:53.017 --> 13:54.587
Worse.

13:55.181 --> 13:57.171
- We just have to follow the tracks?
- Yeah, well...

13:57.218 --> 14:00.863
Those lead into the woods.
This way back into school.

14:01.316 --> 14:02.609
You wanna split up?

14:02.657 --> 14:03.877
Never again.

14:04.401 --> 14:05.825
Thank God.

14:14.417 --> 14:16.051
I hate horses.

14:18.266 --> 14:19.864
Nice horse...

14:19.940 --> 14:21.614
Oh!

14:33.721 --> 14:34.785
Hey, you made it out!

14:34.855 --> 14:37.586
Yeah, barely! What's the plan?

14:37.634 --> 14:39.345
Uh, steal the horse and get to the Hunt.

14:39.473 --> 14:40.942
You're kidding, right?

14:41.051 --> 14:43.883
I went through all this to
keep you from being taken.

14:44.430 --> 14:45.572
You need a hand?

14:45.784 --> 14:47.461
I'm good.

14:50.918 --> 14:53.172
Then go already! Go!

15:09.056 --> 15:10.743
You know how to ride a horse?

15:10.791 --> 15:12.078
Not really.

15:19.270 --> 15:20.867
Peter!

15:21.469 --> 15:23.754
- Malia.
- What?

15:24.051 --> 15:27.040
The only way we were able
to break through the Hunt

15:27.754 --> 15:31.291
is with an emotional connection.

15:31.588 --> 15:33.709
Dang. Wish I could help.

15:35.915 --> 15:38.580
I'm not saying it. I'm not saying it.

15:38.628 --> 15:40.481
Okay, well, I guess everyone dies.

15:47.027 --> 15:48.324
Dad.

15:49.930 --> 15:51.410
<i>Dad.</i>

15:51.473 --> 15:54.793
- Dad.
- Say it like you mean it.

16:04.979 --> 16:06.612
Dad.

16:07.084 --> 16:09.051
Please wake up.

16:09.733 --> 16:11.634
<i>Dad.</i>

16:34.074 --> 16:36.778
The train will
be arriving <i>in 17 minutes.</i>

16:36.934 --> 16:38.754
Are you sure it's him?

16:38.946 --> 16:40.731
I know his smile,

16:40.809 --> 16:42.278
I know his touch...

16:42.418 --> 16:45.748
And I know that that's his voice.

16:45.981 --> 16:47.650
It has to come from somewhere.

16:50.200 --> 16:53.043
Mason. We have to go.

16:54.628 --> 16:57.908
- Just give me a minute, I can find it...
- We don't have a minute. They're coming.

17:18.079 --> 17:19.512
Liam?

17:27.448 --> 17:29.353
When did you learn how to ride a horse?

17:29.548 --> 17:30.993
Just now.

17:34.101 --> 17:36.002
Wait, wait. Down.

17:36.624 --> 17:38.087
Why're we stopping?

17:38.272 --> 17:40.041
It's there.

17:40.441 --> 17:42.885
- It can't be this easy.
- Yes, it can, Scott.

17:42.977 --> 17:44.173
It can be this easy.

17:44.244 --> 17:47.246
- For once, let's do easy.
- Okay.

17:49.139 --> 17:50.569
Oh, God.

17:52.695 --> 17:54.201
Or not.

18:08.002 --> 18:10.169
Nope, not easy at all.

18:14.351 --> 18:16.413
<i>Attention, all passengers,</i>

18:16.505 --> 18:19.171
<i>the train will be
arriving in 12 minutes.</i>

18:21.852 --> 18:23.367
Me?

18:23.586 --> 18:27.195
You want me to stop them?

18:27.497 --> 18:29.125
You know how many there are?

18:29.403 --> 18:31.133
Yeah. A lot of them. So get going.

18:31.211 --> 18:34.647
There are hundreds of waiting
rooms in this train station

18:34.695 --> 18:38.805
which apparently now also serves
as a high school library.

18:38.891 --> 18:40.719
- It's impossible.
- We can try.

18:40.881 --> 18:43.234
Where do you get this
implausible optimism?

18:43.282 --> 18:44.562
Definitely not from my father.

18:44.651 --> 18:45.773
We don't have time for this.

18:45.853 --> 18:47.937
We need someone to just hear us.

18:48.000 --> 18:50.422
I think we already did.

19:04.582 --> 19:06.222
Stiles?

19:06.270 --> 19:08.551
Damn! Man! Are you okay?

19:08.674 --> 19:10.800
I think so. I finally saw
the girls' locker room.

19:10.848 --> 19:13.106
It's not that different.
It's kind of disappointing.

19:13.364 --> 19:15.403
- What just happened?
- I don't know. I think the worlds...

19:15.450 --> 19:16.886
I think they're collapsing
in on each other.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.629
Attention, all passengers.

19:18.684 --> 19:20.941
<i>The train will be
arriving in 11 minutes.</i>

19:21.043 --> 19:23.129
- We gotta get back to the diverter.
- Yeah.

19:54.011 --> 19:55.965
Get behind me. They
won't take a Banshee.

19:56.021 --> 19:57.651
You sure about that?

20:19.450 --> 20:20.984
Malia!

20:21.737 --> 20:23.166
Lydia...

20:33.483 --> 20:35.330
He did it.

21:02.147 --> 21:04.515
Malia, go!

22:01.144 --> 22:02.644
Whoa!

22:18.726 --> 22:20.710
<i>Attention, all passengers.</i>

22:20.799 --> 22:23.593
<i>The train will be
arriving in nine minutes.</i>

22:42.954 --> 22:44.546
Attention, all passengers.

22:44.639 --> 22:47.140
The train will be arriving
in eight minutes.

22:50.756 --> 22:52.373
Damn it!

23:04.376 --> 23:06.030
Scott, I can't fight this guy.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.364
I didn't say it back.

23:31.490 --> 23:33.400
You don't have to.

23:59.377 --> 24:00.728
God!

24:01.299 --> 24:03.166
They're all sealed shut.

24:06.980 --> 24:09.887
Bet you wouldn't mind having a
werewolf around right now...

24:10.052 --> 24:12.420
to rip them off their hinges.

24:18.093 --> 24:20.791
Like to have one around for
another reason right now.

24:20.839 --> 24:22.606
Get back.

24:31.106 --> 24:32.403
Oh, God!

24:39.624 --> 24:41.858
I gotta get me one of these.

24:45.584 --> 24:47.258
Argent!

25:40.209 --> 25:43.344
- What was that for?
- That was so hot.

25:51.253 --> 25:54.355
I'd almost say
you enjoy this, Scott.

25:55.291 --> 25:58.989
The pursuit of utterly futile endeavors.

25:59.037 --> 26:01.229
Step back from the diverter.

26:01.687 --> 26:03.217
Or I'll make you step back.

26:04.529 --> 26:07.268
Now that's the German
way of doing things.

26:08.919 --> 26:11.739
You would've made an
excellent Nazi Youth.

26:12.662 --> 26:14.609
Maybe you didn't hear me.

26:15.162 --> 26:17.098
I said step back.

26:19.841 --> 26:22.483
And maybe you didn't hear me.

26:51.208 --> 26:52.880
<i>Stiles.</i>

26:55.310 --> 26:57.040
<i>Stiles? Is that you?</i>

26:57.380 --> 26:58.474
Mom?

26:58.560 --> 27:00.709
Stiles, that's not your mom.

27:00.779 --> 27:02.240
I know who it is. I know her voice.

27:02.365 --> 27:05.012
No, that's the Wild Hunt.
They're tricking you.

27:05.107 --> 27:07.124
Stiles, please believe me.

27:07.201 --> 27:09.630
The Wild Hunt brought her
back, but she's not real.

27:10.699 --> 27:12.139
What do you mean "brought her back?"

27:12.201 --> 27:13.734
Stiles.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.167
I know what you've been through.

27:17.443 --> 27:20.146
I know how much you love your father.

27:26.902 --> 27:28.903
But I love him more.

27:37.020 --> 27:38.278
Okay, we need to unplug him.

27:38.326 --> 27:39.966
We need to just get him
out of this thing.

27:40.013 --> 27:42.185
I'll start with the big one.
I'll pull it quick.

27:42.233 --> 27:44.662
It'll hurt, but Corey can heal.

27:44.779 --> 27:46.310
We can't.

27:46.445 --> 27:48.107
Not until Scott diverts the train.

27:48.373 --> 27:50.990
If we stop the merging, Scott won't
be able to find the diverter.

27:51.106 --> 27:52.506
You wanna just leave him like this?

27:52.584 --> 27:54.261
We have to give Scott more time.

27:54.309 --> 27:57.411
Look at him. We... We
need to do something.

27:57.736 --> 27:59.369
Not yet...

28:03.329 --> 28:05.997
You have to try to save everyone.

28:06.453 --> 28:08.123
How do we save you?

28:11.951 --> 28:14.415
Unbelievable.

28:14.677 --> 28:18.334
Even in the face of insurmountable odds.

28:18.998 --> 28:22.717
I don't know if it's
suicide or stupidity.

28:22.943 --> 28:25.068
Maybe both.

28:25.170 --> 28:26.685
Either way, I'm getting
to that diverter.

28:26.732 --> 28:31.248
You of all people, Scott, should
know what happens to a lone wolf.

28:31.989 --> 28:34.029
He's not alone.

28:36.748 --> 28:37.948
He's got a pack.

28:39.088 --> 28:41.322
And Theo's not in it.

28:41.857 --> 28:43.435
But I am.

28:43.492 --> 28:45.255
I'm not in the pack.

28:45.303 --> 28:48.005
But no one likes a Nazi.

29:52.550 --> 29:55.558
Your little friends are no
match for the Wild Hunt.

29:55.831 --> 29:59.323
There are too many of
us and too few of you.

30:00.547 --> 30:02.144
Even from the Hunt,

30:02.247 --> 30:05.127
you somehow wormed your
way back into his memory.

30:05.175 --> 30:07.561
Yeah, worming is one of my skills.

30:07.609 --> 30:10.674
That thing is conjured
from your dad's pain.

30:10.800 --> 30:14.645
If he remembers you, he
can't believe in her.

30:14.693 --> 30:16.750
That's why you have to go.

30:21.557 --> 30:23.453
You shouldn't
treat your mother that way.

30:23.458 --> 30:25.893
You're not my mother.

31:55.111 --> 31:57.017
You missed your train.

32:09.838 --> 32:11.605
Now!

32:12.605 --> 32:14.138
It's okay.

32:14.619 --> 32:15.766
I'll heal.

32:16.013 --> 32:17.446
Promise?

32:36.970 --> 32:38.947
He believes in me.

32:39.904 --> 32:42.902
Dreams. So hard to kill.

32:43.065 --> 32:45.080
But not impossible.

32:46.947 --> 32:48.197
Noah.

32:48.276 --> 32:50.337
Your bullets can't hurt me.

32:53.022 --> 32:54.489
Fire again.

34:00.038 --> 34:02.072
Where are you going?

34:02.773 --> 34:04.274
Stop.

34:05.113 --> 34:07.047
<i>Zuruckkommen.</i>

34:09.663 --> 34:11.585
Come back and kill them.

34:11.646 --> 34:13.347
<i>Tote sie.</i>

34:15.569 --> 34:17.648
Yeah, call your army back.

34:18.214 --> 34:20.181
Or don't they listen to you?

34:21.377 --> 34:22.540
I am your leader.

34:22.804 --> 34:24.663
<i>Ich bin dein Anfuhrer!</i>

34:25.132 --> 34:26.592
Obey me.

34:26.735 --> 34:28.902
Gehorcht mir.

34:37.627 --> 34:39.161
Kill them.

34:42.951 --> 34:44.437
All of them.

34:44.518 --> 34:48.722
<i>Tote sie. Tote sie.</i>

34:56.188 --> 34:58.018
Riders don't bow.

34:58.133 --> 34:59.968
They have no leader.

36:20.063 --> 36:21.730
Let's go.

36:28.754 --> 36:29.805
Okay.

36:29.918 --> 36:31.053
Can you fix this?

36:31.101 --> 36:32.405
Oh, she knows what she's doing.

36:32.453 --> 36:34.599
Have you ever heard of the Nine Herbs?

36:34.738 --> 36:38.042
The nine sacred herbs of the Saxons
used to cure poison and infections?

36:38.090 --> 36:39.676
Yeah, of course.

36:39.743 --> 36:41.083
Did you need to know
what they are, or...

36:41.130 --> 36:43.364
No. I think I've got it.

36:54.431 --> 36:56.052
Have a great
summer, everyone.

36:56.100 --> 36:57.232
- No.
- To the Seniors,

36:57.280 --> 36:58.783
I'll see you at graduation.

36:58.831 --> 37:01.708
No, no, no, no. That's it? What?

37:01.787 --> 37:03.421
Last day ever.

37:03.905 --> 37:06.603
Well, it just feels so anti-climactic.

37:06.757 --> 37:09.036
Well, there's the whole
graduation thing.

37:09.084 --> 37:10.225
I've gotta go to summer school

37:10.272 --> 37:12.319
or I can't do the whole
graduation thing.

37:13.545 --> 37:15.068
Let's do it.

37:15.161 --> 37:17.255
No. Come on, wait...

37:17.534 --> 37:19.435
Guys?

37:22.233 --> 37:24.367
This can't be it.

37:35.810 --> 37:38.544
I can't believe we're
not in high school anymore.

37:39.154 --> 37:41.657
Kind of feels like
nothing's really changed.

37:52.999 --> 37:54.724
Everything's changed.

38:00.377 --> 38:02.603
Okay! So, Liam, since
you're the new Alpha...

38:02.666 --> 38:03.547
I'm not an Alpha.

38:03.595 --> 38:05.134
Right, but, you know, Alpha-in-training.

38:05.181 --> 38:06.520
Well, I'd have to kill an Alpha.

38:06.583 --> 38:09.014
Liam. Since you're taking over,

38:09.161 --> 38:10.606
the most important
thing you can remember

38:10.653 --> 38:12.803
is that Mason is always gonna be the one

38:12.851 --> 38:14.748
who's there to save
your ass all the time.

38:14.849 --> 38:15.919
Well, not all the time.

38:15.973 --> 38:17.294
Most of the time though.

38:17.380 --> 38:19.328
Which is why...

38:21.317 --> 38:22.482
I think you're gonna need this.

38:22.529 --> 38:24.159
Uh, I don't play baseball.

38:24.201 --> 38:26.865
Right, neither do I. It's...
It's not the point.

38:26.973 --> 38:29.671
- Okay. Thanks.
- Here you go.

38:30.569 --> 38:32.106
Love you guys.

38:32.194 --> 38:33.834
Right.

38:35.212 --> 38:37.013
I leave you with this.

38:37.881 --> 38:40.578
You know, hurt her and I'll kill you.

38:40.686 --> 38:41.772
You sure you won't need it?

38:41.820 --> 38:43.452
It's okay. Lydia's gonna
drive me down to D.C.

38:43.499 --> 38:46.121
She wants to help me
move into my dorm, so...

38:46.990 --> 38:48.757
You know she's starting MIT as a Junior?

38:48.806 --> 38:51.491
- How do you even do that?
- I... She's a genius.

38:51.647 --> 38:53.561
Real question is how'd
you get into UC Davis?

38:54.678 --> 38:56.343
How did you get into George Washington?

38:56.391 --> 38:57.991
I don't know. Uh, your dad.

38:58.077 --> 39:02.324
The, uh, big FBI pops made a call
to the little pre-FBI program.

39:03.094 --> 39:04.728
Pre-FBI.

39:07.218 --> 39:08.807
Well, I guess we're not the same kids

39:08.855 --> 39:10.209
running around the woods
looking for a body.

39:10.256 --> 39:11.980
No, we're not.

39:16.460 --> 39:17.849
You know, you can keep the Jeep.

39:17.897 --> 39:20.355
No, I... I want you to have it.

39:23.116 --> 39:25.327
Oh... Stiles.

39:25.375 --> 39:26.506
These aren't the keys to the Jeep.

39:26.553 --> 39:27.850
Well, that's one to your house,

39:27.905 --> 39:30.522
another to your room, uh, it's
the master key to the school,

39:30.570 --> 39:33.532
Animal Clinic, key to
the Sheriff's station.

39:33.663 --> 39:36.436
Just figured you should have all
the copies I secretly made. So...

39:36.484 --> 39:38.118
Yeah.

39:43.962 --> 39:45.702
They still need us.

39:49.569 --> 39:51.336
They'll always need us.

39:52.202 --> 39:53.616
And, you know, I...

39:53.707 --> 39:55.445
I need you.

39:55.592 --> 39:57.392
You know that.

39:59.064 --> 40:00.765
I need you too.

40:01.620 --> 40:03.254
I'm gonna miss you.

40:06.894 --> 40:09.491
No, really, I need you though, uh...

40:09.663 --> 40:12.888
I lost my license in the Hunt.
So you have to drive.

40:13.380 --> 40:14.358
Your dad is the Sheriff.

40:14.444 --> 40:17.839
I'm sure he'll let it slide. You drive.

40:24.862 --> 40:26.125
<i>Unit Four, repeat.</i>

40:26.256 --> 40:29.153
<i>You're telling me there's
a body in the woods?</i>

40:29.205 --> 40:30.628
<i>That's exactly what I'm saying.</i>

40:30.675 --> 40:32.934
<i>There's a body in the woods...</i>
