00:00.134 --> 00:02.835
♪♪

00:06.841 --> 00:11.710
A) every human being
is a unique collection of atoms.

00:11.712 --> 00:15.814
B) some of you in this room
might be human beings.

00:17.752 --> 00:21.820
C) when you mess with atoms,
or human beings, they blow up.

00:21.822 --> 00:23.956
Belgium, 1831!

00:23.958 --> 00:25.924
Okay, everybody,
it's happening right now.

00:25.926 --> 00:27.760
Under your desks.
Farkle's gonna blow.

00:27.762 --> 00:30.195
I know everything
except belgium, 1831.

00:30.197 --> 00:31.864
And once i know that,
i'll know everything!

00:31.866 --> 00:33.265
And then my name goes
on the board with those
three idiots!

00:36.904 --> 00:39.238
-Breathe, farkle.
-Too late.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.939
I taste blue.

00:43.778 --> 00:45.878
You know, with anybody else,
that would've been strange.

00:45.880 --> 00:48.914
But with farkle,
we don't even lift him
off the floor anymore.

00:48.916 --> 00:50.749
Oh, here's your book.

00:50.751 --> 00:51.917
Ugh.

00:53.788 --> 00:54.987
Sorry to interrupt,
mr. Matthews,

00:54.989 --> 00:56.789
I'm here to speak
with farkle minkus.

00:56.791 --> 00:58.791
Farkle, guidance counselor.

00:58.793 --> 01:00.826
Well, it's about time.

01:02.997 --> 01:04.930
Are you finally
taking him away?

01:04.932 --> 01:06.599
He goes, we all go.

01:06.600 --> 01:08.267
I'm here, so it's not
just the girls.

01:09.003 --> 01:10.936
There are no secrets
in our group.

01:10.938 --> 01:11.937
Nothing can come between--

01:11.939 --> 01:13.238
-(bell rings)
-okay.

01:14.708 --> 01:15.908
Farkle, i have
the results...

01:15.910 --> 01:17.709
Of my i.Q.
And aptitude test?

01:17.711 --> 01:19.745
I'm a genius, right?
You know how i know?
'cause i'm a genius.

01:19.747 --> 01:21.680
It's not conceited
when it's true.
Right, mr. Matthews?

01:21.682 --> 01:23.248
I wouldn't know.
I'm barely literate.

01:24.819 --> 01:27.753
Your parents have given
me permission to tell you
that yes,

01:27.755 --> 01:29.855
You scored in
the superior range.

01:29.856 --> 01:31.956
And my aptitude test says
i should consider a career in...

01:31.959 --> 01:34.293
"ruling the world."

01:34.295 --> 01:36.996
Never seen that one.
(laughs)

01:36.997 --> 01:39.698
The rest of the class falls
within a more traditional
range of careers.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.867
Although, we did get one
bunny farmer...

01:41.869 --> 01:44.303
Riley: Yay.

01:44.304 --> 01:46.738
...And "armpit sniffer #5"
in a deodorant factory.

01:46.740 --> 01:47.940
Maya: I got a job!

01:47.942 --> 01:52.778
But i would expect there's
going to be further testing,
is that right, ms. Oben?

01:52.780 --> 01:55.013
Yes. When someone scores
this high,

01:55.015 --> 01:56.982
The experts usually want
to confirm the testing.

01:56.984 --> 01:59.017
And then, more
specialized schools

01:59.019 --> 02:01.987
With gifted programs,
like einstein academy,
might approach you.

02:01.989 --> 02:03.789
Now, farkle says...

02:03.791 --> 02:04.957
I'd never leave
my friends behind.

02:04.959 --> 02:06.758
Who's a good genius?

02:06.760 --> 02:08.727
I am!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.028
One more thing, farkle.

02:10.030 --> 02:11.930
It's important not
to react to your score

02:11.932 --> 02:13.866
In any way that might
make your friends feel--

02:13.868 --> 02:16.001
Inferior.
Of less value.
Like dum-dums.

02:16.003 --> 02:17.970
We're talking
about my daughter!

02:17.972 --> 02:19.338
Whose fault is that?

Welcome to our farkle
genius party.

03:22.803 --> 03:25.037
I'm stuart minkus,
the original genius,

03:25.039 --> 03:27.406
Very proud to welcome
my son to the club.

03:28.876 --> 03:31.043
I'm sure his mother,
who is unexceptional,

03:31.045 --> 03:34.379
Would like to say a few words
representing her people.

03:34.381 --> 03:37.115
Yeah. I'm unexceptional.

03:37.117 --> 03:38.917
Who does what i say?

03:38.919 --> 03:40.152
Everybody.

03:40.154 --> 03:41.920
Hi, corey.

03:41.922 --> 03:43.822
Nyah!

03:43.824 --> 03:44.957
Stop it.

03:44.959 --> 03:45.958
Look at her.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.560
What? I like her now.

03:47.561 --> 03:49.161
She's a lot less scary
than she was in high school.

03:49.163 --> 03:50.862
Uh-huh.

03:50.864 --> 03:53.916
Are you not looking at her?

03:53.917 --> 03:56.969
I hold in my hand the answer
to the question that everyone's
been asking.

03:56.971 --> 04:00.138
Is farkle a clone? A robot?
Or a real boy?

04:00.140 --> 04:02.908
Real boy, real boy,
real boy, real boy.

04:02.910 --> 04:05.177
This is the birth certificate
of farkle minkus.

04:05.179 --> 04:07.012
Real boy!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.147
(cheering)

04:10.918 --> 04:12.918
Thanks for having me, mom.

04:12.920 --> 04:14.119
Any time, kiddo.

04:14.121 --> 04:17.889
You make me proud
every day.

04:17.891 --> 04:20.959
Stuart and i want to thank
all of farkle's friends
who care about him.

04:20.961 --> 04:23.529
You're all he ever
talks about.

04:23.530 --> 04:26.098
We hope you'll keep encouraging
him to be as unique as he's
always been.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.068
The minkuses have always been
simple, incredibly rich people.

04:30.070 --> 04:33.038
Please enjoy our party,
and don't forget your
complimentary penguin.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.606
(penguins squeak)

04:37.978 --> 04:40.012
Hey, minkus, great party.

04:40.014 --> 04:41.947
Nice shirt.
I don't care about
any of that.

04:41.949 --> 04:44.516
You married jennifer bassett.
Did you know that?

04:46.153 --> 04:48.020
We fell in love.

04:48.022 --> 04:49.221
She told me.

04:49.223 --> 04:50.922
Maya, when i rule the world,

04:50.924 --> 04:52.224
I'll give you half
because you're my lovely
fake wife.

04:52.226 --> 04:54.092
Hey, i want some
of that!

04:54.094 --> 04:56.028
Yeah, farkle,
you love them equally.

04:56.030 --> 04:58.196
Marry them both.
Wouldn't that be
the genius thing to do?

04:58.198 --> 05:00.999
See why i keep you around!
Make it happen, face.

05:01.969 --> 05:03.068
Here we go.

05:05.072 --> 05:07.039
-Riley matthews?
-Yes.

05:07.041 --> 05:08.474
-Would you...
-Absolutely.

05:08.475 --> 05:09.908
-...Do me the honor...
-Any time at all.

05:09.910 --> 05:11.043
-...Of becoming...
-Whatever you want.

05:11.045 --> 05:12.944
-...Mrs...
-Do you not
understand "yes"?

05:12.946 --> 05:14.246
...Farkle minkus?

05:14.248 --> 05:15.748
You're gonna
be there, right?

05:15.749 --> 05:17.249
-A yes is a yes.
Here's your ring.
-Hey!

05:17.251 --> 05:19.201
-You get two penguins.
-Okay.

05:19.202 --> 05:21.152
Maya, marry us quick
while she's still distracted
by the sparkles.

05:22.256 --> 05:23.555
Okay.

05:24.992 --> 05:26.224
Blah, blah blah.

05:26.226 --> 05:27.492
I do.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.194
Blah, blah blah.

05:29.196 --> 05:30.996
There it is.

05:32.232 --> 05:34.182
What do you want?

05:34.183 --> 05:36.133
If anyone has any reason
why these two shouldn't
be joined--

05:36.136 --> 05:37.169
I object, yes.

05:37.171 --> 05:39.154
Smackle.

05:39.155 --> 05:41.138
You made it to
the wedding, smackle!

05:43.010 --> 05:45.077
Still having trouble
with the hugging thing,
aren't you?

05:45.079 --> 05:48.113
The average middle schooler
spends nine minutes a day
engaged in hugs.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.015
Do you know what
i accomplish in those
nine minutes?

05:50.017 --> 05:51.516
-No.
-Ask nasa.

05:53.220 --> 05:56.054
Smackle, here to mock
my recent membership
into the genius club?

05:56.056 --> 05:57.255
On the contrary, farkle.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.157
I welcome you
with open arms.

06:03.063 --> 06:04.262
My arms.

06:04.264 --> 06:06.064
They are open.

06:06.066 --> 06:07.599
What do you want me
to do with that?

06:09.269 --> 06:11.069
We are both
geniuses now.

06:11.071 --> 06:13.238
Yup. That makes us
even more alike that
we were.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.272
And as we both know...

06:14.274 --> 06:16.141
Like forces repel.

06:16.143 --> 06:18.009
Yes, science says
we may never be together.

06:18.011 --> 06:19.244
And science never
makes a mistake.

06:19.246 --> 06:24.049
Really? Have you seen
the blobfish?

06:24.051 --> 06:27.052
Why, science? Why?

06:29.289 --> 06:32.190
I'm here to ask you
to consider transferring
to einstein academy.

06:32.192 --> 06:33.191
That's not happening.

06:33.193 --> 06:34.292
Stop hitting on me.

06:34.294 --> 06:36.261
Ha. Okay.

06:38.098 --> 06:40.031
What would be the benefits
of my going to einstein?

06:40.033 --> 06:42.033
To develop
your magnificent brain

06:42.035 --> 06:44.019
So the world is not cheated
of your full potential.

06:44.020 --> 06:46.004
Are you suggesting that
my dum-dums hold me back?

06:46.006 --> 06:48.573
I am a blobfish.

06:48.575 --> 06:51.276
Yeah... Tell me more
about einstein academy.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.583
Farkle, what are you?

06:58.585 --> 07:01.219
Genius. I'm on the board.

07:01.221 --> 07:02.621
Wrong.

07:02.623 --> 07:04.222
Riley, what are you?

07:04.224 --> 07:06.258
Bunny farmer.

07:06.260 --> 07:08.126
Wrong.

07:08.128 --> 07:12.097
Then don't go
into my room.

07:12.099 --> 07:14.633
All these things that you
guys have been told
you are this week?

07:14.635 --> 07:18.103
That's only a piece
of what makes you an individual.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.305
This i.Q. Test
produces a number

07:20.307 --> 07:22.140
That puts you in a category.

07:22.142 --> 07:23.241
A label.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.210
Don't live under a label.

07:25.212 --> 07:27.179
It just gets in the way
of who you are.

07:27.181 --> 07:29.347
But if you get called something
enough, don't you start
believing it?

07:29.349 --> 07:32.217
Believe in what
you contribute to others.

07:32.219 --> 07:34.352
We expect great things
from you, farkle.

07:34.354 --> 07:37.055
I'll try my best, sir.

07:37.057 --> 07:41.226
But, i also expect
great things from
everybody else.

07:41.228 --> 07:45.096
Remarkable people have
i.Q.'s all across the board.

07:45.098 --> 07:47.265
Everyone has great gifts,

07:47.267 --> 07:49.100
And everyone in this class

07:49.102 --> 07:52.103
Has the potential
to impact our world.

07:52.105 --> 07:54.206
So just be yourself.

07:54.208 --> 07:56.208
It's the only label
that matters.

07:57.344 --> 07:59.344
Mr. Matthews?

07:59.345 --> 08:01.345
If it's all right with you,
i need a moment with farkle.

08:01.348 --> 08:03.248
Okay. Farkle?

08:17.364 --> 08:19.164
So, they did more testing on me.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.132
How big a genius
are you?

08:21.134 --> 08:24.236
Riley, they're considering
some behavioral traits
in farkle

08:24.238 --> 08:26.404
That warrant a more
specific kind
of testing.

08:26.406 --> 08:29.307
What? They just noticed
farkle's a little farkly?

08:29.309 --> 08:31.409
I could have told them that.

08:31.411 --> 08:33.445
They want to see
if i have autism.

08:34.715 --> 08:36.381
You don't.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.316
Let's go tell them
you don't.

08:38.318 --> 08:41.186
I might have a type of autism
called asperger's syndrome.

08:41.188 --> 08:42.420
You don't.

08:42.422 --> 08:44.306
What is it?

08:44.307 --> 08:46.191
It's a disorder that affects
a person's behavior.

08:47.327 --> 08:50.228
Farkle, when i said that
you were a little farkly,
what i meant was...

08:50.230 --> 08:52.297
Yeah, that you behave
just like a perfectly
normal farkle.

08:52.299 --> 08:54.249
You do.

08:54.250 --> 08:56.200
We'll get the results
from today's interview,
and we'll know.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.302
We know.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.820
We don't know.

08:58.821 --> 09:00.337
Guys, i've passed every
single test i've ever taken.

09:00.340 --> 09:02.791
He made us come right over.

09:02.792 --> 09:05.243
He didn't want to go home,
he didn't want to do anything
except be with you.

09:05.245 --> 09:06.411
Of course.

09:06.413 --> 09:08.713
That's who he is.

09:08.715 --> 09:10.415
I see it
in my classroom every day.

09:12.419 --> 09:15.220
The most important thing
to him was that you're
a part of this.

09:15.222 --> 09:17.289
Because he's farkle.

09:17.291 --> 09:18.390
That's who you are,

09:18.392 --> 09:20.258
No matter what
anybody says.

09:27.501 --> 09:30.368
Could you please give us
one of your wonderful little
riley pick-me-ups?

09:30.370 --> 09:32.804
Whatever happens, at least
you're in better shape
that maya.

09:34.308 --> 09:36.474
Okay, that wasn't what
i was going for, but sure,
let's turn on me.

09:36.476 --> 09:38.443
You think you got stuff?

09:38.445 --> 09:40.512
Look at this!
This is a bag of cats.

09:40.514 --> 09:42.314
Okay there,
little helper.

09:42.316 --> 09:45.383
All right, this website lists
symptoms of asperger's.

09:45.385 --> 09:47.752
Uh, the first one they mention
is social awkwardness.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.220
Check.

09:49.222 --> 09:50.455
You don't do anything awkward.

09:51.758 --> 09:53.792
Ha!

09:53.794 --> 09:56.328
Well, that's just something
you do and you're gonna
stop doing that.

09:56.330 --> 09:57.762
He's gonna
stop doing that.

09:57.764 --> 09:59.331
"narrowed interests.

09:59.333 --> 10:01.283
"going on about a subject

10:01.284 --> 10:03.234
"even if the people he's
talking to don't have
a shared interest."

10:03.236 --> 10:04.786
Check.

10:04.787 --> 10:06.337
Farkle, we're interested
in everything you're
interested in.

10:06.340 --> 10:07.856
Belgium, 1831!

10:07.857 --> 10:09.373
Stop doing that.
He's gonna stop doing that.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.244
Guys, whatever this is,
i got it.

10:13.246 --> 10:15.280
And i need you
to let that be okay.

10:15.282 --> 10:18.249
"some people with asperger's
are uncomfortable
being touched

10:18.251 --> 10:20.251
"or receiving affection.

10:20.253 --> 10:23.221
"they may struggle
to fully understand
emotion or love."

10:23.223 --> 10:25.557
Check, check,
checky-check, check.

10:25.559 --> 10:27.325
Farkle, what are you
talking about?

10:27.327 --> 10:29.527
You love riley and me
since the day we met.
You married us.

10:29.529 --> 10:30.562
It wasn't real.

10:30.564 --> 10:32.330
Oww.

10:33.567 --> 10:35.533
But it's very sweet.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.369
And it's all
about emotions.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.471
You guys are my
best friends. Please promise
me one thing.

10:39.473 --> 10:42.307
Anything.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.409
Please don't ever let me
not understand love.

10:49.449 --> 10:52.317
Nothing's ever been
out of our control before.

10:52.319 --> 10:55.420
We usually control everything
with money and penguins.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.873
(laughing)

10:57.874 --> 11:00.325
You guys are gonna get
the results, and no matter
what they say,

11:00.327 --> 11:03.328
You're gonna keep being
the same great parents
you've always been.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.963
You'll figure this out.

11:04.964 --> 11:06.597
-You sure?
-Of course, i'm sure, stuart.

11:06.600 --> 11:08.600
I mean, you are almost
as smart as me.

11:08.602 --> 11:11.302
Oh, thanks.

11:11.304 --> 11:13.371
Jennifer, you're pretty strong.

11:13.373 --> 11:15.407
Nothing stands
a chance against you.

11:15.409 --> 11:17.475
All my life,
nothing's ever frightened me.

11:17.477 --> 11:19.661
Then i had a child,

11:19.662 --> 11:21.846
And the thought of something
happening to him frightens
me every day.

11:24.317 --> 11:25.583
No matter what
they tell you,

11:25.585 --> 11:28.286
He's farkle,
and we love him.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.587
Thanks for being here
for us, guys.

11:29.589 --> 11:31.489
Every day.

11:35.896 --> 11:38.463
Would you guys be upset
if i transferred
to einstein academy?

11:39.433 --> 11:40.432
Yes.

11:40.434 --> 11:41.934
Would you still
be my friends?

11:41.935 --> 11:43.435
Boy, for someone who's
gonna rule the world,

11:43.437 --> 11:45.403
You sure ask
some dum-dum questions.

11:50.444 --> 11:51.543
Farkle.

11:51.545 --> 11:52.577
People who aren't farkle.

11:52.579 --> 11:53.645
Hey, smackle.

11:53.647 --> 11:55.513
Stop smothering me.

11:55.515 --> 11:56.881
Okay.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.520
Friends. Hugging.

12:02.522 --> 12:05.623
I suppose this is all
very important to people
like you.

12:05.625 --> 12:08.626
You love us, smackle,
you just don't know it yet.

12:08.628 --> 12:10.995
Noted.

12:10.996 --> 12:13.363
Farkle, i'm here to see
how you enjoyed your tour
of einstein academy.

12:13.366 --> 12:15.533
-You went?
-He spent the day with us.

12:15.535 --> 12:17.435
He fit.

12:17.437 --> 12:18.570
And so will this.

12:21.408 --> 12:22.440
How does it look?

12:22.442 --> 12:25.376
I'm swooning.

12:25.378 --> 12:28.480
Perhaps we could indulge
in our established ritual
of sharing a smoothie?

12:28.482 --> 12:30.515
Thanks, but i'm not really
thirsty right now.

12:30.517 --> 12:34.486
Nor am i really interested
in the consumption of
a frozen treat...

12:36.923 --> 12:38.490
What are you doing?
What is she doing?

12:38.492 --> 12:39.624
Who do we call?

12:40.694 --> 12:42.494
I believe
she's winking at me.

12:42.496 --> 12:43.695
How do you like it?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.633
Yeah, let's see it
with one eye.

12:50.637 --> 12:53.438
-Two, yes, two eyes.
-Please, don't...

12:53.440 --> 12:55.707
Why don't i get us
a table outside?

13:05.519 --> 13:08.520
Farkle, isadora smackle
loves you!

13:08.522 --> 13:11.123
But i'm loyal
to both of you.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.725
Well, your two fake wives
want you to spend time
with one real smackle.

13:13.727 --> 13:15.693
Go get 'em, tiger.

13:15.695 --> 13:17.629
Why are you doing this?

13:17.631 --> 13:19.631
Did you ask us
to help you understand love?

13:19.633 --> 13:20.632
Yeah.

13:20.634 --> 13:21.699
Then go figure it out.

13:21.701 --> 13:23.668
Yeah, we heard
you're a genius.

13:34.548 --> 13:36.748
It feels strange to be together
not in a spelling bee,
or something.

13:36.750 --> 13:40.485
Well, i am more comfortable
saying things in spelling bees.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.420
Like you in that blazer: Hunk.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.721
H-u-n-k. Hunk.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.492
Uh, could you use that
in a sentence, please?

13:47.494 --> 13:49.994
You look great
in that blazer, hunk.

13:54.467 --> 13:56.467
This is new.

13:56.469 --> 13:57.635
New is interesting.

13:57.637 --> 13:59.437
What else is new?

13:59.439 --> 14:00.772
My blazer is new.

14:00.774 --> 14:02.774
Me being called
a hunk is new.

14:05.445 --> 14:07.478
I may have a form
of autism.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.513
Really?

14:08.515 --> 14:10.548
Asperger's syndrome.

14:10.550 --> 14:11.783
This may be
too much for you.

14:11.785 --> 14:13.551
I understand
if you wish to leave.

14:13.553 --> 14:15.453
I would never leave.

14:15.455 --> 14:16.487
This doesn't scare you?

14:16.489 --> 14:17.589
Not at all.

14:17.591 --> 14:19.591
May i tell you
that it scares me?

14:21.027 --> 14:22.594
You are holding my hand.

14:24.064 --> 14:25.730
Is that okay?

14:25.732 --> 14:27.565
It's the hunk move.

14:29.603 --> 14:31.069
Thank you, isadora.

14:31.071 --> 14:33.037
For what?

14:33.039 --> 14:35.607
For liking me
for whatever i am.

14:47.821 --> 14:51.556
(bell rings)

14:51.558 --> 14:53.558
-Farkle.
-Hello, smackle.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.560
You observed me
in my natural habitat,

14:55.562 --> 14:59.631
So i asked mr. Matthews
if i could observe you
in mediocreville.

14:59.633 --> 15:01.633
-I hope that's not offensive.
-Of course, it is.

15:01.635 --> 15:02.767
I have no remorse.

15:05.105 --> 15:06.671
Glad you could
join us, smackle.

15:06.673 --> 15:10.108
Lucas, you have to stop.

15:10.110 --> 15:12.610
It's never gonna happen.

15:13.747 --> 15:16.581
Lucas, take a hint.

15:19.619 --> 15:20.718
Wow.

15:22.689 --> 15:24.656
Farkle

15:24.658 --> 15:26.374
May we speak privately?

15:26.375 --> 15:28.091
There's no need, ms. Oben.
I understand what i have.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.594
I'll be fine.

15:29.596 --> 15:32.096
Well, i understand
i'm talking to a genius,

15:32.098 --> 15:34.632
But i don't think
you understand at all.

15:34.633 --> 15:37.167
I've spoken with your parents
and they're okay if we have
a conversation.

15:45.779 --> 15:47.545
Farkle time?

15:47.547 --> 15:48.613
Absolutely.

15:51.685 --> 15:54.652
Asperger's syndrome
is an autism spectrum disorder.

15:54.654 --> 15:56.721
A.S.D.

15:56.722 --> 15:58.789
This is a pretty complicated
label, so i wanna explain
it to you.

15:59.893 --> 16:03.728
People with a.S.D. Can fall
anywhere on a spectrum
of different behaviors.

16:03.730 --> 16:05.830
They talked to me
for a long time.

16:05.832 --> 16:07.699
And you know what?

16:07.701 --> 16:09.634
I don't have asperger's.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.903
But they also said
they don't know what
to make of me.

16:13.773 --> 16:16.140
And i like that.

16:16.142 --> 16:17.909
So, what am i?

16:17.911 --> 16:20.912
I'm farkle!
Thank you.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.859
We're all a unique
collection of atoms,

16:34.861 --> 16:36.894
And there's only one
of each of us.

16:36.896 --> 16:39.931
The only label you
should wear

16:39.933 --> 16:41.866
Is your name.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.736
Let your actions define you.

16:44.738 --> 16:46.904
Because there's
another spectrum.

16:46.906 --> 16:49.941
How you live your life,

16:49.943 --> 16:52.210
What you do with
whatever you're given.

16:54.214 --> 16:57.215
How you treat
the other people around you.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.717
These are your actions.

16:59.719 --> 17:01.819
This is your name.

17:01.821 --> 17:03.821
That's who you are.

17:04.891 --> 17:06.724
Thanks for the way
you treat me.

17:06.726 --> 17:08.259
And thanks for studying
all of it.

17:09.729 --> 17:10.795
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

17:10.797 --> 17:11.963
You guys studied?

17:13.900 --> 17:15.767
Hey, our friend
was worried about something.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.736
So, we learned about it.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.704
If i knew it was studying,
i wouldn't have done it.

17:22.776 --> 17:25.377
Ms. Smackle?

17:25.378 --> 17:27.979
I believed that farkle would
be better off attending
einstein academy.

17:27.981 --> 17:31.783
Observing him in
your inferior class
was to be my proof.

17:31.785 --> 17:34.719
Don't hold back, smack,
just say what's on your mind.

17:34.721 --> 17:36.954
My findings are contradictory
to my hypothesis.

17:36.956 --> 17:39.724
Also, please talk down to us.

17:41.728 --> 17:44.796
This class teaches lessons
you cannot find in a textbook.

17:46.800 --> 17:50.301
There are friendships here
that can't be created
in a laboratory.

17:51.938 --> 17:53.671
Farkle,

17:53.673 --> 17:54.906
You are where
you belong.

17:56.676 --> 17:58.709
I, on the other hand,

17:58.711 --> 17:59.944
Should leave.

18:13.693 --> 18:15.026
Hey, remember when
we were in high school,

18:15.028 --> 18:16.528
And you thought
i was a monster

18:16.529 --> 18:18.029
Just because i was bigger
and different than everybody,

18:18.031 --> 18:19.964
And i handcuffed shawn
to a boathouse?

18:21.968 --> 18:24.268
Yeah.

18:24.270 --> 18:25.937
Well, it never mattered
what people said about me.

18:25.939 --> 18:27.839
I've always been
comfortable with myself

18:27.841 --> 18:29.907
No matter what
anybody else called me.

18:29.909 --> 18:32.276
I think that's a good way
to go through life, monster.

18:32.278 --> 18:35.746
Even if farkle had been
diagnosed with something,

18:35.748 --> 18:37.315
It never would have
changed how much
we love him.

18:37.317 --> 18:39.984
Or each other.

18:39.986 --> 18:41.953
Thank you for my son.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.754
Thank you
for marrying me.

18:43.756 --> 18:46.023
Yeah, well,
you told me to.

18:46.025 --> 18:47.992
Hey, guys,
we appreciate you
going through this with us.

18:47.994 --> 18:49.894
Yeah, that's what
friends do.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.796
Hey, monster?

18:51.798 --> 18:53.064
Yeah?

18:53.066 --> 18:54.932
You don't scare me anymore.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.075
I'm okay.

19:04.077 --> 19:05.877
I will go
though life alone.

19:05.879 --> 19:08.079
Isadora, you haven't
lost farkle.

19:08.081 --> 19:09.847
He doesn't want me now.

19:09.849 --> 19:11.315
Why?

19:11.317 --> 19:13.017
Because he doesn't
have asperger's...

19:13.019 --> 19:15.086
Like you?

19:15.088 --> 19:17.955
How did you know?

19:17.957 --> 19:19.056
We studied.

19:19.058 --> 19:20.892
We're studiers.

19:20.894 --> 19:21.993
She made me.

19:23.930 --> 19:27.899
I was diagnosed
when i was five years old.

19:27.901 --> 19:30.868
I... Struggle with it.

19:30.870 --> 19:33.804
Isadora, i don't think
there's anybody we respect
more than you.

19:33.806 --> 19:35.106
I'm not like
everybody else.

19:35.108 --> 19:37.008
But who wants that?

19:37.010 --> 19:40.077
The strangest thing
is that i feel so comfortable
with farkle.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.780
But he's not quite
like me anymore.

19:42.782 --> 19:45.116
But i thought that's what
you guys always wanted.

19:45.118 --> 19:47.885
You were like forces
and like forces repel.

19:47.887 --> 19:50.004
Yeah, smackle.

19:50.005 --> 19:52.122
Science dictates that you
guys can be together now.

19:52.125 --> 19:53.357
You think he knows that?

19:53.359 --> 19:56.060
Ladies!

19:57.063 --> 19:58.896
Farkle, my arch nemesis.

19:58.898 --> 20:00.982
Smackle, my arch nemesis.

20:00.983 --> 20:03.067
Riley, maya,
my wives who i will
adore forever.

20:03.069 --> 20:05.002
I want a divorce.
Make it a double.

20:06.906 --> 20:09.974
This is the longest
relationship i've ever had.

20:11.377 --> 20:12.944
You will love again, riley.

20:19.018 --> 20:21.886
Oh, i'm gonna leave
you twos alone now.

20:26.125 --> 20:28.092
Isadora, i'm
a single man now.

20:29.896 --> 20:31.829
Farkle, before
we continue,

20:31.831 --> 20:33.965
There's something
i need to tell you.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.867
-I have--
-i know you do.

20:36.869 --> 20:40.037
I also know you showed me
understanding and compassion.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.405
Of course.

20:41.407 --> 20:43.107
Please, let me do the same.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.944
May i hug you?

20:46.946 --> 20:48.045
Yes.

20:54.988 --> 20:56.120
I don't like this at all.

20:56.122 --> 20:57.421
I know.

20:58.925 --> 20:59.957
Don't stop.

20:59.959 --> 21:01.192
Okay.

21:10.003 --> 21:11.168
These are my friends, isadora.

21:11.170 --> 21:12.937
They like me
for who i am.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.106
They make me feel
like i could rule the world.

21:15.108 --> 21:18.175
Yeah, so forget trying
to steal farkle over
to einstein.

21:18.177 --> 21:19.977
You come
to john quincy adams.

21:19.979 --> 21:21.946
What would be
the benefits?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.214
You would have
good friends here.

21:25.485 --> 21:27.051
But, i'm not good at that.

21:27.053 --> 21:29.086
Yeah, but...

21:29.088 --> 21:31.105
We are.

21:31.106 --> 21:33.123
Maybe if you were in
a place where you had
some good friends...

21:33.126 --> 21:35.092
You wouldn't
struggle as much.

21:35.094 --> 21:36.961
People change people.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.062
Secret of life.

21:43.202 --> 21:45.102
You just won't
give up, will you?

21:46.105 --> 21:47.471
Nope.

21:47.473 --> 21:49.073
Looks good on you,
though, smackle.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.978
Okay. I have
a question for everybody,

21:53.980 --> 21:56.981
And i want you guys to answer
as honestly as you can.

21:56.983 --> 21:59.016
Who here is normal?

22:01.521 --> 22:03.521
And who here wants to be?

22:11.064 --> 22:12.263
