WEBVTT

00:46.129 --> 00:48.131
Stop! Please!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.134
You have to help me!

00:52.511 --> 00:55.764
My name is Eric Cresswell.

00:56.390 --> 00:58.141
Someone's trying to kill me.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.161
Any more on Eric Cresswell?

02:00.329 --> 02:01.330
Yeah, nothing official.

02:01.413 --> 02:03.665
But we did some deep background
with local agencies,

02:03.749 --> 02:05.334
and it seems that in the 1990s,

02:05.417 --> 02:08.961
there were some rumors about Professor
Cresswell's professional conduct.

02:09.045 --> 02:10.047
Underage girls.

02:10.130 --> 02:13.550
Well, more inappropriate relationships
with female students.

02:13.634 --> 02:16.970
They were of age,
but there were certainly concerns.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.682
- Any evidence?
- Not that we're aware.

02:21.266 --> 02:23.727
And we're still not sure
whether he's alive or dead, right?

02:23.810 --> 02:24.978
Right.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.189
- Anything from the asset?
- Not yet.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.691
There's also the trackers
we put in their bags at the airports.

02:29.775 --> 02:31.860
Which helps us if they carry them.
If they don't--

02:31.944 --> 02:34.738
And both teams monitoring cameras
across the city.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.073
He will be in touch.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.408
- We've got a hell of a lot riding on that.
- I know.

02:38.492 --> 02:39.952
Not as much as the Newmans.

02:41.578 --> 02:42.955
We can rely on him.

02:44.957 --> 02:47.626
Why one of the most popular
landmarks in Manhattan?

02:48.126 --> 02:49.795
I thought you didn't know New York.

02:49.878 --> 02:53.131
I don't. So if I've heard of
Washington Square Park, it's popular.

02:53.215 --> 02:55.509
Surely a back alley in Queens would
draw less attention.

02:55.592 --> 02:57.928
Well, that's the point, right,
according to Sean?

02:58.011 --> 03:00.264
And this does seem to be
his specialist subject.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.891
Back alleyways are suspicious,

03:02.975 --> 03:05.727
so you meet in a well-known,
high-traffic spot,

03:05.811 --> 03:07.271
and nobody notices anyone.

03:07.354 --> 03:10.816
They're all too busy taking in the sights
or looking at their phones.

03:13.193 --> 03:14.820
Was he there when you woke up?

03:14.903 --> 03:15.904
No.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.534
Did he tell you how he's planning on
getting us in front of Copeland?

03:20.617 --> 03:21.702
No.

03:23.537 --> 03:24.913
Do you trust him?

03:26.415 --> 03:29.334
I don't trust anyone,
but it was our idea to follow him.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.839
This time last week, I was a university
lecturer doing the department a favor.

03:33.922 --> 03:34.923
Now I'm…

03:37.134 --> 03:38.552
headline news.

03:40.053 --> 03:42.431
- Let's not panic.
- Too late.

03:42.514 --> 03:45.267
The last place they'll expect us
to be is New York.

03:46.560 --> 03:47.936
Maybe we should split up.

03:48.645 --> 03:49.897
Sean said to stay together.

03:49.980 --> 03:52.065
At least until the others get here,
we'll stay local.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.736
What happened to
"This seems to be his specialist subject"?

03:55.819 --> 03:58.739
What happened to being an independent
woman who has a mind of your own?

04:31.021 --> 04:32.189
Eddie.

04:52.835 --> 04:53.961
This is him.

04:55.003 --> 04:56.004
Hello?

04:58.090 --> 04:59.758
The gang are about to rendezvous
with Tilson

04:59.842 --> 05:01.051
outside Washington Square Park.

05:01.134 --> 05:02.594
Where are you headed?

05:02.678 --> 05:04.513
- Yeah, I have no idea.
- To Leo?

05:04.596 --> 05:06.098
- Sorry, who's that?
- Never mind.

05:07.391 --> 05:08.517
As far as I'm aware,

05:08.600 --> 05:10.435
Tilson hasn't told anyone
where we're going.

05:10.519 --> 05:14.314
- Do you know which of them is involved?
- No. No, I don't yet.

05:14.398 --> 05:16.984
But Monique Thompson,
that wasn't anything to do with us.

05:17.067 --> 05:19.528
Them.
It wasn't anything to do with them.

05:19.611 --> 05:21.363
And Tilson's keeping
a pretty hard eye on me,

05:21.446 --> 05:22.698
but I think I'm okay.

05:23.198 --> 05:25.993
And listen, Copeland--
I know the FBI have run a check on him,

05:26.076 --> 05:28.370
but… it needs to be done
more thoroughly,

05:28.453 --> 05:30.539
because all four have had
dealings with him.

05:30.622 --> 05:32.082
And I'm pretty sure--

05:33.208 --> 05:34.835
- Fuck.
- Shit.

05:34.918 --> 05:36.503
Aadesh. Aadesh.

05:36.587 --> 05:37.963
What's happening?

05:39.173 --> 05:40.174
Shit.

05:40.257 --> 05:42.467
- Oh, shit. Sorry. Sorry.
- Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

05:42.551 --> 05:44.178
Aadesh, listen to me.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.680
- Listen. You're gonna get us caught.
- Fuck you. Fuck--

05:46.763 --> 05:48.724
- Whatever you heard back there--
- Who are you?

05:48.807 --> 05:51.143
Would you just calm down?
You're gonna get us both caught.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.769
Caught by who? The police?

05:53.478 --> 05:55.314
You are the police.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.191
- No, I'm not.
- Bullshit, man.

05:57.274 --> 05:58.442
- Do you--
- Bullshit.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.861
You've been lying to me from the start.

06:01.528 --> 06:02.529
No, I haven't.

06:02.613 --> 06:04.615
I haven't been playing you.

06:04.698 --> 06:06.116
- I trusted you.
- I know.

06:07.159 --> 06:08.619
I'm sorry. I should have told you.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.370
- Told me what?
- It's just-- I couldn't.

06:11.038 --> 06:12.497
Told me what?

06:14.041 --> 06:16.960
I am working undercover,
just not for the police.

06:19.171 --> 06:20.547
It's for Katherine Newman.

06:22.591 --> 06:23.800
- For Katherine Newman?
- Yeah.

06:24.384 --> 06:29.723
She hired me to find out which one of you
was involved in Leo's kidnapping.

06:30.224 --> 06:31.308
Why you?

06:32.893 --> 06:35.729
Because I'd had security service training
when I was back home.

06:37.606 --> 06:39.816
And I'm better at being other people
than being myself.

06:39.900 --> 06:40.901
No, man.

06:42.528 --> 06:44.196
No, man. Why should I believe you now?

06:44.780 --> 06:46.240
Because we're friends.

06:47.282 --> 06:48.659
How can we be friends?

06:50.035 --> 06:52.704
- I don't even know who you are.
- Yeah, you do.

06:52.788 --> 06:53.997
- No, man.
- Yes.

06:54.081 --> 06:55.457
You're a liar, Eddie.

06:56.875 --> 06:57.876
So are you.

06:58.836 --> 06:59.837
Everybody is.

07:01.755 --> 07:05.008
Aadesh, it's the others
you need to be worried about, not me.

07:07.594 --> 07:10.556
- Do the police know about you?
- No. Nobody knows anything.

07:11.056 --> 07:13.642
Copeland doesn't even know.
Dude, she doesn't trust anybody.

07:16.770 --> 07:19.606
Aadesh, I can protect you,
but this has to stay between us.

07:25.112 --> 07:26.488
Show me the phone.

07:26.572 --> 07:29.324
- Dude.
- Eddie, show me the phone.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.123
You're telling me,

07:37.374 --> 07:39.793
if I redial the last number
you called on that device,

07:40.669 --> 07:42.421
Katherine Newman will pick up?

07:44.506 --> 07:45.716
Listen…

07:47.301 --> 07:49.428
I know you've got nothing to do with this.

07:50.721 --> 07:53.265
And I promise I'll make sure
everybody else knows that too.

07:53.348 --> 07:56.476
But the only way this really ends
is if we get to Leo.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.646
You just have to trust--

08:07.446 --> 08:09.031
Is the asset's cell still live?

08:09.114 --> 08:11.283
- Yes.
- Then we assume he's fine.

08:11.366 --> 08:13.577
And as far as Copeland goes,
we're always thorough.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.038
It was the first thing we did.
There was nothing there.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.956
We're still monitoring his communications.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.750
Fine. But with all due respect,

08:19.833 --> 08:22.169
you didn't know he has links
to all four suspects, did you?

08:22.252 --> 08:24.129
All right. Let's stay in touch.

09:21.144 --> 09:22.145
Hey.

09:24.147 --> 09:25.190
Come here.

09:29.194 --> 09:30.529
What is this?

09:33.323 --> 09:35.701
Get in. Yeah?

09:35.784 --> 09:37.494
- Come here.
- Seriously, Sundance?

09:38.078 --> 09:39.663
After everything we've
been through together?

09:41.790 --> 09:42.875
Sit in the front.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.793
Keep an eye on him.

09:47.045 --> 09:48.172
Hey.

09:49.339 --> 09:50.340
Hey.

09:55.429 --> 09:56.513
What's this?

09:59.683 --> 10:01.602
It's not…

10:05.105 --> 10:07.691
- I got it at the airport, just in case.
- In case of what?

10:08.984 --> 10:10.110
I don't know.

10:11.737 --> 10:14.156
In case I found myself
running around a foreign city

10:14.239 --> 10:16.158
with four strangers
accused of a federal crime.

10:20.495 --> 10:22.706
- Why the bullet phone?
- The what phone?

10:22.789 --> 10:26.418
Minimal metal components
so they don't set off alarms,

10:26.502 --> 10:28.462
and small enough
to be packed you-know-where.

10:30.255 --> 10:31.465
Hey, look at me.

10:33.592 --> 10:35.260
All I know is it was the cheapest.

10:39.181 --> 10:42.100
Excuse me. You need a permit to park here.

10:42.184 --> 10:43.894
Sure. Sorry. Okay.

10:44.561 --> 10:45.687
Get in the car.

11:01.828 --> 11:04.248
We need to hold our nerve and not panic.

11:05.707 --> 11:08.460
And in London? Any word from your guy?

11:08.544 --> 11:10.754
They're still focused
on the British suspects.

11:10.838 --> 11:13.799
I stressed the importance
of finding Eric Cresswell.

11:13.882 --> 11:18.011
Good. Well, if they or my guys get to
Cresswell and sit on him long enough,

11:18.095 --> 11:20.430
hopefully this conversation becomes
hypothetical.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.308
But as worst-case scenarios
are our business

11:23.392 --> 11:24.685
and the clock is ticking,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.813
Kate asked me
to look into prime-time interviewers

11:27.896 --> 11:30.399
so that she can answer questions direct.

11:30.482 --> 11:31.984
It's the last thing I'd advise,

11:32.067 --> 11:35.404
but just for the record,
they're all interested.

11:35.487 --> 11:37.114
Okay. Good.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.949
So we're in the driver's seat.

11:39.032 --> 11:41.243
Neil DiMarco is particularly keen.

11:41.326 --> 11:43.495
I bet he is.
Have you seen his latest ratings?

11:43.579 --> 11:44.746
What about Nancy Harper?

11:46.874 --> 11:48.584
That is not a good idea, Kate.

11:48.667 --> 11:51.044
That pit bull would maul her own mother.

11:51.128 --> 11:53.255
We get caught out
going with someone friendly on this,

11:53.338 --> 11:54.882
and it could backfire.

11:54.965 --> 11:57.509
Excuse me, folks. Sorry to interrupt.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.804
- What is it?
- Oh, it's nothing to worry about.

12:00.888 --> 12:03.182
But I do need to talk to you
for a few minutes.

12:10.731 --> 12:12.900
You've worked with Mr. Copeland
for a long time?

12:12.983 --> 12:13.984
What is this?

12:14.067 --> 12:16.361
Any particular disagreements
in the past year or so?

12:16.445 --> 12:18.238
We've been through all this.

12:18.322 --> 12:19.990
Several, on most days.

12:20.073 --> 12:21.742
That's why we're still working together.

12:21.825 --> 12:24.453
Martin's the only person I can trust
to be honest with me.

12:25.829 --> 12:27.623
Will you get to the point, please?

12:27.706 --> 12:29.625
So you do? Trust him?

12:29.708 --> 12:31.251
Still not the point.

12:32.044 --> 12:34.129
Leo doesn't have time for this,
Mr. Neilssen.

12:34.213 --> 12:35.464
Right.

12:36.757 --> 12:38.175
We've received some information

12:38.258 --> 12:44.014
that Mr. Copeland may have had dealings
with some, if not all, of the UK suspects.

12:44.097 --> 12:46.308
What kind of dealings?
Personal or professional?

12:46.934 --> 12:48.352
We're looking into that.

12:48.977 --> 12:52.022
- You don't know anything about it?
- No, I don't.

12:53.148 --> 12:54.983
- Okay.
- Where does this information come from?

12:56.193 --> 12:58.862
Well, we're getting fresh leads
all the time, Ms. Newman.

12:59.530 --> 13:02.574
You have to let us do our work
before we can brief you. You understand.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.285
- You think it's reliable?
- No reason to doubt.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.373
You were preparing to step away
from the business,

13:09.456 --> 13:11.041
taking on the ambassador's role.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.752
Leo was officially charged
with running the foundation.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.799
How involved is Mr. Copeland
in the company's future planning?

13:19.299 --> 13:22.427
Martin is involved in everything.

13:23.512 --> 13:24.888
Right.

13:29.351 --> 13:31.270
Thank you, Mr. Neilssen.

13:44.950 --> 13:45.951
What was that about?

13:46.785 --> 13:49.246
- Alice, can you give us a second?
- Sure.

13:54.751 --> 13:57.045
- Kate?
- The British suspects.

13:57.129 --> 13:58.755
Is there anything you didn't tell me?

14:00.215 --> 14:02.134
I told you everything you needed to know.

14:03.468 --> 14:04.636
What did Neilssen want?

14:05.429 --> 14:06.889
You sure there's nothing else?

14:06.972 --> 14:10.142
Kate, I'm positive. It's all handled.

14:10.726 --> 14:12.603
There's nothing for you to worry about.

14:15.314 --> 14:16.315
Good.

14:28.911 --> 14:30.329
Where exactly are we going?

14:34.458 --> 14:35.792
Is something bothering you?

14:37.044 --> 14:38.921
When are you gonna tell us
what the plan is?

14:39.004 --> 14:40.631
The less you know, the safer you are.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.758
That worked out so well for me last time,
didn't it?

14:42.841 --> 14:44.218
Well, he's got us this far.

14:44.301 --> 14:46.345
He could be taking us anywhere.

14:46.428 --> 14:48.138
What if it's not Copeland we're going to?

14:48.222 --> 14:49.973
What if it's where he's hiding Leo,

14:50.057 --> 14:51.683
and him and Copeland are setting us up?

14:52.476 --> 14:54.269
You can get out anytime you like, Natalie.

14:54.353 --> 14:56.188
I'm not sure how much we needed him
to get here.

14:56.271 --> 14:57.731
It was way easier than I thought.

15:01.902 --> 15:02.945
That's it.

15:03.654 --> 15:05.864
That's what's bothering you.
It was too easy.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.201
Why are you so quiet?

15:10.077 --> 15:11.078
Guys. Look!

15:12.371 --> 15:13.372
We're famous.

15:14.456 --> 15:17.042
Yeah, except it's not us, is it?

15:17.626 --> 15:20.003
I saw a guy on the street selling masks.

15:20.087 --> 15:22.548
- Of us?
- Of the royals. The kidnappers.

15:24.216 --> 15:26.426
They're heading southwest on FDR Drive.

15:29.346 --> 15:32.599
Chopra still has his bag
with the tracker. So far so good.

15:34.351 --> 15:36.061
This is all upside down, man.

15:36.144 --> 15:38.981
- They're criminals, not superheroes.
- We don't know what they are.

15:39.064 --> 15:42.317
- Did someone legalize kidnapping?
- They haven't asked for money.

15:42.401 --> 15:45.153
If they did it to expose lies,
people can get behind that.

15:45.237 --> 15:47.614
- I can get behind that.
- Yeah, I could too.

15:47.698 --> 15:49.575
If it hadn't ruined my life.

15:49.658 --> 15:51.368
You're not so innocent, you know.

15:51.451 --> 15:53.829
Whatever you were a week ago, the fact is

15:53.912 --> 15:58.292
you're now a fugitive traveling
with a fake passport in a stolen vehicle

15:58.375 --> 15:59.668
with a trained killer.

16:01.837 --> 16:03.005
It's not stolen.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.883
Right.
Vehicle is not registered as stolen.

16:05.966 --> 16:08.010
Tilson will have contacts
all over the state.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.262
Any idea where they're heading yet?

16:10.888 --> 16:13.807
If I was a betting man,
I'd say over the river into Brooklyn.

16:13.891 --> 16:17.811
As for why,
I know who I hope they're taking us to.

16:18.687 --> 16:21.273
- What is it?
- We lost the asset's mobile.

16:21.899 --> 16:23.108
Okay, so he turned it off.

16:23.192 --> 16:24.902
No, the signal disappeared
from the network,

16:24.985 --> 16:26.904
which means the phone
or the SIM's been destroyed.

16:26.987 --> 16:29.156
Look. You saw him yourself in the park.
He's fine.

16:31.283 --> 16:32.326
We gotta let them run.

17:07.277 --> 17:08.278
What's this for?

17:08.362 --> 17:11.031
Contact Copeland using the same system
they were using on the laptop.

17:13.032 --> 17:14.617
- The trace?
- Yeah, whatever.

17:14.701 --> 17:16.203
- I can't.
- But you have to.

17:17.037 --> 17:20.165
He was already logged in on that machine.
On this one, it would take hours.

17:20.249 --> 17:24.127
g_host_global@letmail.com.
Do it now. Okay?

17:24.962 --> 17:27.714
- Why would Copeland come here?
- Yeah, is that your plan?

17:28.339 --> 17:29.883
Seriously, why would he trust that?

17:30.634 --> 17:33.887
- He won't. That's why he'll come.
- Yeah, but why here?

17:33.971 --> 17:36.640
Do you see any cameras around here?
We need him on safe ground.

17:36.723 --> 17:39.434
And you better stop staring at me
and start working.

17:39.518 --> 17:40.978
You remembered his email address.

17:42.104 --> 17:43.230
So? We were all there.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.234
Any of you remember it?

17:48.402 --> 17:49.528
No.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.407
So I've got a good memory.

17:54.074 --> 17:56.451
- Now, what are you waiting for?
- Sean.

17:59.955 --> 18:01.623
Do you know Martin Copeland?

18:03.876 --> 18:05.043
I knew it.

18:05.544 --> 18:06.628
No.

18:07.337 --> 18:10.507
- We told you everything.
- Oh, man.

18:10.591 --> 18:11.800
All right, enough!

18:11.884 --> 18:13.093
I'm not one of you.

18:13.177 --> 18:14.970
I never said that we were
in this together.

18:15.512 --> 18:19.099
The deal is I take you to Copeland,
and that's what I'm gonna do.

18:19.183 --> 18:20.934
Now, you hurry the fuck up.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.775
All right.

18:29.401 --> 18:30.569
Have we lost them?

18:30.652 --> 18:33.614
No, not lost. Our tracker has them
inside the warehouse complex.

18:33.697 --> 18:34.698
Hey.

18:34.781 --> 18:37.409
Hey, as soon as you get the floor plan,
we need to see it too.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.204
Yeah, and details
on whoever owns the place.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.872
Right.

18:41.955 --> 18:44.416
He took us to the perfect place
to hide someone.

18:44.499 --> 18:45.709
Time to call in backup.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.385
When he starts getting nervous, that's
when I start getting really nervous.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.479
Okay. You lot. Get in, quickly.

19:07.272 --> 19:08.273
Get in the van.

19:12.653 --> 19:14.905
You stay in the van. You don't move. Okay?

19:25.415 --> 19:27.251
What the fuck?

19:27.334 --> 19:29.670
- What's he doing?
- Where the fuck is he going?

19:29.753 --> 19:31.505
Shit.

19:42.683 --> 19:43.684
See you later.

19:46.228 --> 19:47.437
Hi, Erin. How are you?

19:47.521 --> 19:49.022
- I'm okay.
- Good.

19:53.068 --> 19:56.113
I just got off the phone
with Nancy Harper's people.

19:58.031 --> 20:00.200
They seem to think we're doing this today.

20:00.284 --> 20:01.368
I had Barbara set it up.

20:01.952 --> 20:04.162
- But I thought we agreed--
- No, you and Alice agreed.

20:04.246 --> 20:06.498
I listened to your advice
like I always do.

20:06.582 --> 20:08.041
And I decided to go another way.

20:08.876 --> 20:09.877
Can I ask why?

20:09.960 --> 20:11.962
Right now
this is the only thing I can control.

20:12.546 --> 20:15.299
- You sure about that?
- It's not exactly an unfamiliar scenario.

20:15.799 --> 20:17.843
- I should know the rules.
- Right.

20:18.719 --> 20:21.680
But isn't rule number one
avoid Nancy Harper?

20:23.765 --> 20:26.727
Didn't you say
you needed to go out this morning?

20:30.022 --> 20:31.565
We need to stay together on this, Kate.

20:33.108 --> 20:37.070
This goes wrong,
it could destroy everything we've built.

20:37.154 --> 20:38.822
Nothing can take that away.

20:38.906 --> 20:40.407
I'm talking about the future.

20:40.490 --> 20:42.367
Without Leo, there is no future.

20:43.493 --> 20:44.953
I thought you understood that.

21:00.219 --> 21:01.220
Hi.

21:01.303 --> 21:04.264
I'm sorry, but I don't think
I'm gonna be able to get away after all.

21:05.724 --> 21:07.935
Right. As discussed. Exactly.

21:08.685 --> 21:09.686
Let me know.

21:13.732 --> 21:15.943
I knew this would happen. I'm leaving.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.861
- Do what?
- No.

21:17.945 --> 21:19.238
What if we're safer in here?

21:19.821 --> 21:23.200
In here? Sitting ducks, more like it.

21:23.283 --> 21:25.118
- Right, Eddie?
- He's taken the keys.

21:25.202 --> 21:26.537
And the gun.

21:50.811 --> 21:53.564
I'm telling you,
we need to get out of here now.

21:54.815 --> 21:56.525
I think we should trust him.

21:56.608 --> 21:57.609
Out!

21:57.693 --> 21:58.986
Fuck.

22:03.574 --> 22:06.285
Sounds like your pal found them,
as agreed.

22:11.081 --> 22:12.082
Move it!

22:19.381 --> 22:22.301
Move it. Slowly.

22:23.927 --> 22:25.137
What else is in that bag?

22:27.014 --> 22:28.807
Out! Now!

22:39.526 --> 22:41.987
- Game on.
- Okay.

22:43.322 --> 22:45.574
New York says
best approach is from the river.

22:50.162 --> 22:51.455
What if there are more?

22:51.538 --> 22:54.499
- Whoever sent him--
- We know who sent him. Copeland.

22:54.583 --> 22:56.376
Yes, but how did he know we were here?

22:56.460 --> 22:58.587
- 'Cause it was a setup.
- How do you know?

23:01.340 --> 23:03.175
Because you set it up.

23:03.258 --> 23:05.719
- Backstabbing bastard.
- I just saved your life.

23:05.802 --> 23:08.263
It only needed saving because of you.

23:08.347 --> 23:11.016
- I told you we shouldn't trust him.
- Looks like I got it wrong.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.476
Let me get this straight.

23:12.559 --> 23:15.145
So you've let us think
that we've persuaded you to bring us here,

23:15.229 --> 23:16.730
when all this time…

23:17.731 --> 23:19.733
And you accused me of shithousery.

23:21.068 --> 23:23.028
- Why?
- Why what?

23:24.154 --> 23:25.447
Why didn't you let him kill us?

23:26.114 --> 23:29.243
Because delivering you for execution
wasn't the deal that we made.

23:29.326 --> 23:30.661
So what was the deal?

23:31.870 --> 23:32.996
Sean.

23:33.789 --> 23:35.290
What was the deal?

23:36.667 --> 23:39.837
We meet here, and Copeland questions you
about the whereabouts of Leo Newman.

23:39.920 --> 23:43.173
Then, depending on your answers,
either you go free or you don't.

23:43.257 --> 23:44.967
That's none of my business.

23:48.220 --> 23:49.763
Why would you do that to us?

23:50.347 --> 23:52.850
- Why? After everything--
- Why do you think?

23:52.933 --> 23:56.895
- What's the only reason he does anything?
- Copeland pays me when I bring you to him.

23:56.979 --> 23:58.021
That was the deal.

23:58.814 --> 23:59.815
Still can be.

24:01.149 --> 24:03.235
- What are you saying?
- He thinks you're dead.

24:03.861 --> 24:06.196
I'm prepared to get you to him,
but you need to decide quickly,

24:06.280 --> 24:09.157
because I'm pretty sure
the only reason we've made it this far is

24:09.241 --> 24:10.534
because we've been allowed to.

24:11.827 --> 24:12.828
Why?

24:13.871 --> 24:16.540
- Is backup on the way?
- First team is approaching.

24:17.875 --> 24:19.710
Thought I was supposed to be
the impatient one.

24:32.723 --> 24:35.976
They're going in blind.
All they have is the element of surprise.

24:37.394 --> 24:39.438
We don't want any dead bodies in there.

24:51.033 --> 24:52.451
Zebra-two standing by.

24:54.661 --> 24:57.706
Zebra-one in position.
Eyes on. No movement.

24:59.082 --> 25:02.294
Aviation-one
in a holding pattern over location.

25:05.297 --> 25:07.549
How can we trust
a single thing he says after this?

25:07.633 --> 25:09.343
I don't need your trust.

25:09.426 --> 25:11.345
Now, we can all go
our separate ways right now,

25:11.428 --> 25:14.932
but I am going to Copeland
with or without you.

25:15.015 --> 25:16.225
I'm not gonna ask again.

25:18.101 --> 25:20.437
He's still the only person
that can answer our questions.

25:20.521 --> 25:23.899
- Yeah, but the only way to get to him is--
- Where exactly is Copeland? Do we know?

25:23.982 --> 25:25.234
The Park Madison Hotel.

25:25.817 --> 25:29.446
Which we can all agree would be
pure fucking madness given the--

25:42.876 --> 25:44.127
Hey, buddy.

25:44.920 --> 25:45.963
Hey, I'm so sorry.

25:47.673 --> 25:48.715
I'm so sorry.

25:53.512 --> 25:54.847
Go, go, go, go, go.

25:58.725 --> 26:00.394
Adam-eight, we are in position.

26:01.562 --> 26:02.604
Boy-eight, in position.

26:03.397 --> 26:04.940
Aviation-one, holding.

26:15.742 --> 26:16.994
They're in position.

26:17.536 --> 26:19.705
On my signal. Stand by to advance.

26:19.788 --> 26:21.123
Look, the tracker.

26:23.375 --> 26:25.169
- They're moving.
- Zebra-two, can you confirm?

26:25.252 --> 26:28.505
- No. Can you confirm, aviation-one?
- We have movement.

26:28.589 --> 26:31.383
- The van is on the move.
- Permission to engage.

26:31.466 --> 26:33.302
Does anybody have eyes on Leo?

26:34.344 --> 26:36.054
Negative, boy-eight.

26:36.138 --> 26:38.348
Vehicle moving east along dry dock.

26:39.099 --> 26:40.684
Is the asset inside the vehicle?

26:40.767 --> 26:43.520
Repeat, is the asset inside the vehicle?

26:44.688 --> 26:46.064
Is Leo with them?

27:05.209 --> 27:08.462
Suspect vehicle
approaching Manhattan Bridge.

27:08.545 --> 27:09.922
There has to be some trace of Leo.

27:10.005 --> 27:11.757
What the hell else were they doing
in there?

27:13.008 --> 27:14.676
Yeah, besides killing people, right?

27:15.511 --> 27:16.720
They're not killers.

27:16.803 --> 27:18.931
Sure leaving a lot of bodies behind them.

27:19.014 --> 27:20.390
No IDs on the bodies?

27:22.392 --> 27:23.977
What the hell are they doing?

27:24.061 --> 27:26.605
Suspects' vehicle approaching
Brooklyn Bridge, westbound.

27:28.398 --> 27:30.400
Requesting LMSI support.

27:32.736 --> 27:35.864
Vehicle passing City Hall Park.
Approaching Chambers Street.

27:35.948 --> 27:37.741
LMSI to aviation-one,

27:37.824 --> 27:40.035
we have your vehicle
heading for Foley Square.

27:40.118 --> 27:41.495
What the hell?

27:42.663 --> 27:43.664
What?

27:44.414 --> 27:47.209
They parked at 26 Federal Plaza.

27:48.377 --> 27:49.962
FBI headquarters.

27:50.671 --> 27:53.298
I want a two-block perimeter
cleared around Foley Square.

27:53.382 --> 27:55.968
Have all traffic diverted
from Broadway and Centre Street

27:56.051 --> 27:57.261
and Chambers and Canal.

27:57.344 --> 28:00.514
Maintain firearms control.
Clear all civilians out.

28:00.597 --> 28:03.183
Bomb squad operational in three minutes.

28:10.732 --> 28:12.860
TAG team two in position.

28:12.943 --> 28:14.987
Emergency ADAM-one in position.

28:19.533 --> 28:21.034
No visual on Leo.

28:22.327 --> 28:23.620
If they wanted to turn themselves in,

28:23.704 --> 28:25.581
they would've gotten out
of the vehicle already.

28:25.664 --> 28:27.332
Not if they're worried about getting shot.

28:27.416 --> 28:28.792
Well, it's a little late for that.

28:29.585 --> 28:31.461
Don't worry.
No one's getting trigger-happy,

28:31.545 --> 28:33.338
especially if Leo might be in there.

28:40.345 --> 28:43.473
Occupants of the blue van,
police approaching.

28:43.557 --> 28:45.475
Do not move.

28:47.060 --> 28:50.314
Driver, lower your window
and throw the keys out.

28:53.901 --> 28:55.944
Lower your window right now!

29:00.199 --> 29:01.200
Keys out!

29:01.950 --> 29:04.494
I'm looking right at you.
Throw it out now!

29:05.704 --> 29:07.956
Good. I wanna see both hands.

29:09.917 --> 29:11.960
I want to see that right hand now!

29:12.544 --> 29:13.587
Move it!

29:21.261 --> 29:22.846
He gave me $200.

29:23.722 --> 29:27.351
Told me to drive around, and at exactly
2:00 p.m., park outside that coffee shop.

29:27.434 --> 29:30.145
He said, "Stay in the car, and someone
will come take the keys off you."

29:30.229 --> 29:31.396
Oh, God.

29:32.481 --> 29:33.815
Son of a bitch.

29:34.691 --> 29:35.776
Son of a…

29:50.499 --> 29:51.500
Hey.

29:51.583 --> 29:54.336
- Hey, Martin. Good to see you again.
- You too, Nancy.

29:59.758 --> 30:01.134
- Nancy.
- Hey.

30:01.218 --> 30:03.095
Thank you for doing this
on such short notice.

30:03.178 --> 30:04.638
Oh, I'm glad you thought of me.

30:05.222 --> 30:06.348
How you holding up?

30:06.431 --> 30:09.268
- Bill and the family okay?
- Same old. So…

30:11.603 --> 30:14.022
Right. Here we go.

30:14.731 --> 30:17.025
Okay, folks. Final checks.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.763
Aadesh better have done his thing.

30:54.271 --> 30:56.273
I can't believe I forgot our key card.

30:57.566 --> 30:59.776
It's 1409, Lomax.

31:00.319 --> 31:02.446
It's spelled I-D-I-O-T.

31:02.529 --> 31:04.323
I'm… so sorry.

31:04.865 --> 31:07.534
I-- Yeah, I can see
where in the room I left it.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.288
- There we go.
- Thank you.

31:12.289 --> 31:16.335
Katherine,
there can't be a mother in America

31:16.418 --> 31:19.087
whose heart isn't breaking
for you right now.

31:20.255 --> 31:21.340
Thank you, Nancy.

31:21.423 --> 31:25.969
And thanks to all the people
who sent messages of support.

31:26.803 --> 31:28.180
I really do appreciate it.

31:28.263 --> 31:31.350
I cannot imagine
what you're going through at the moment,

31:31.433 --> 31:33.602
but I do know you want your boy back

31:33.685 --> 31:36.230
and that you will do anything
to make that happen.

31:36.897 --> 31:39.525
- I'm a mom first.
- Of course.

31:40.317 --> 31:42.819
So, what's taken you so long?

31:43.403 --> 31:46.281
I only mean that,
from the outside looking in,

31:46.365 --> 31:49.535
here's Katherine Newman,
queen of communications,

31:49.618 --> 31:54.081
being asked to communicate
in order to free her only child.

31:54.164 --> 31:56.667
But she doesn't seem to be
saying anything.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.460
Why not?

31:58.544 --> 32:02.422
I was advised by the FBI
not to engage with whoever's holding Leo.

32:02.506 --> 32:05.008
Again, Nancy, in this situation,

32:05.092 --> 32:07.344
I'm no different to any mother
whose child is missing.

32:07.427 --> 32:09.513
So, now you've stopped taking advice?

32:10.264 --> 32:11.265
I'm incredibly grateful…

32:11.348 --> 32:13.141
…to the people trying to find Leo

32:13.225 --> 32:15.310
and bring this nightmare to an end.

32:15.394 --> 32:18.230
But I'm also aware that, ultimately,

32:18.981 --> 32:20.649
Leo is my responsibility.

32:20.732 --> 32:23.819
I get that, but whoever these people are,

32:23.902 --> 32:26.321
what they want is pretty simple, isn't it?

32:26.405 --> 32:30.200
They simply want you to tell the truth.

32:30.284 --> 32:33.620
And that really seems to have struck
a chord with people, doesn't it?

32:33.704 --> 32:36.206
Particularly younger people.
Are you aware of that?

32:36.290 --> 32:38.792
I have told the truth,
to the best of my knowledge.

32:38.876 --> 32:41.003
Well, there's the ambassadorship issue

32:41.086 --> 32:43.630
that, clearly, you were
less than honest about.

32:43.714 --> 32:45.132
Which is why I made a statement.

32:45.215 --> 32:48.302
That must have been particularly
humiliating for you, Katherine.

32:48.385 --> 32:51.638
- Tell me, did the president--
- I'm not here to comment on that.

32:53.140 --> 32:56.768
My only son has been missing
for almost a week.

33:02.566 --> 33:04.484
Let's talk about Eric Cresswell.

33:05.861 --> 33:08.447
What is your relationship to him,
Katherine?

33:08.530 --> 33:10.574
There is no relationship, Nancy.

33:11.074 --> 33:13.452
The only connection, such as it is,

33:13.535 --> 33:16.997
is that, in 1995,
International Oil and Petroleum Energy

33:17.080 --> 33:19.541
commissioned Professor Cresswell
to write a report.

33:19.625 --> 33:22.211
A report, on what exactly?

33:22.711 --> 33:24.588
Well, it's really not
my area of expertise,

33:24.671 --> 33:26.757
but I believe it was a very general study.

33:27.674 --> 33:29.051
There was an ongoing debate

33:29.134 --> 33:31.386
about the environmental impact
of fossil fuels.

33:31.470 --> 33:33.597
So, it was a report on climate change?

33:35.766 --> 33:39.269
IOP Energy were Cooper Newman's
first client, weren't they?

33:40.979 --> 33:42.439
And they remain one of your biggest.

33:42.523 --> 33:43.941
Yes.

33:50.405 --> 33:52.491
To give him his full title,

33:52.574 --> 33:57.204
Mr. Cresswell was Professor of Mathematics
and Climate Modeling

33:57.287 --> 34:00.123
at Cambrook University in the UK

34:00.207 --> 34:02.292
with a reputation
in the scientific community…

34:02.376 --> 34:03.377
I'm in. I did it.

34:03.460 --> 34:06.004
- …as a skeptic regarding climate change.
- I got access to the CCTV network.

34:07.464 --> 34:10.259
What did Professor Cresswell's report say?

34:11.969 --> 34:15.222
What's absolutely essential
to remember, Nancy,

34:15.304 --> 34:19.059
is that 1995 was another world entirely.

34:19.141 --> 34:20.643
You did read the report?

34:21.478 --> 34:23.438
I don't believe it was ever
actually published.

34:23.522 --> 34:27.400
Right. And to this day, it remains
almost impossible to find a copy,

34:27.484 --> 34:29.152
but somehow we did.

34:29.235 --> 34:32.406
Would you like to see it now, Katherine,
to jog your memory?

34:32.489 --> 34:33.489
No, thank you.

34:34.491 --> 34:36.368
Maybe I'll just remind you.

34:36.451 --> 34:40.163
In this report,
written more than 25 years ago,

34:40.246 --> 34:42.498
Professor Cresswell proves

34:42.583 --> 34:45.002
that the upward temperature trend
of the earth's climate

34:45.085 --> 34:49.422
wasn't just part of normal,
long-term fluctuations.

34:50.007 --> 34:52.176
And he makes a series of predictions.

34:52.259 --> 34:53.760
Do you remember any of them, Katherine?

34:54.719 --> 34:56.847
To put this in perspective, Nancy,

34:56.929 --> 34:59.641
our problem,
or rather our client's problem…

34:59.725 --> 35:02.477
- IOP.
- …was that at that particular time,

35:02.561 --> 35:06.148
several other reports surfaced
reaching very different conclusions,

35:06.231 --> 35:08.567
offering alternative predictions.

35:08.650 --> 35:10.110
So to use the word "proves"--

35:10.194 --> 35:12.613
Who commissioned
those other studies, Katherine?

35:13.113 --> 35:14.281
Again, it's not my area,

35:14.364 --> 35:17.576
but I believe it was
a variety of reputable sources.

35:17.659 --> 35:19.661
Paid for by IOP

35:19.745 --> 35:23.540
or by companies affiliated
to Cooper Newman on behalf of IOP?

35:24.458 --> 35:27.753
There were also aggressive publicity
and advertising campaigns

35:27.836 --> 35:30.923
run around this time by the oil industry,
weren't there?

35:31.006 --> 35:33.842
I know you understand
that I can't speak for IOP

35:33.926 --> 35:36.303
let alone the entire oil industry.

35:36.386 --> 35:39.264
If you have questions for them,
you should address them directly.

35:39.348 --> 35:43.393
And if you really wanna know who funds
scientific research in this country,

35:43.477 --> 35:46.063
I am definitely not the person
you need in this chair.

35:46.146 --> 35:50.400
Sure, but having commissioned an expert
to find the truth,

35:51.026 --> 35:54.363
if one of your clients didn't then like
that truth,

35:54.446 --> 35:58.492
isn't it the case that they'd then turn
to you to help them bury it?

35:59.576 --> 36:01.078
Let me provide some context.

36:01.161 --> 36:06.166
Part of my company's responsibility,
which we take very seriously,

36:06.250 --> 36:09.169
is to be sure,
before we go out with any story,

36:09.253 --> 36:11.630
we've looked at all sides of an argument.

36:11.713 --> 36:13.382
This could have saved lives, couldn't it?

36:13.465 --> 36:16.260
It's really not my area of expertise.

36:16.760 --> 36:18.929
But I think it's vital to remember

36:19.012 --> 36:21.306
that its conclusions are
the opinion of one man.

36:22.015 --> 36:25.310
- And there were lots of other opinions.
- But this one was right.

36:26.979 --> 36:32.025
"Temperature change in the Philippines
will force millions from their homes.

36:32.109 --> 36:36.029
The most severe heat wave of the last
half millennia will hit Europe,

36:36.113 --> 36:39.908
leading to thousands
of heat-related fatalities.

36:39.992 --> 36:41.702
Water shortages, crop failures

36:41.785 --> 36:46.373
and livestock fatalities will force
upwards of a million people

36:46.456 --> 36:49.877
from rural areas of Syria to the cities,

36:50.377 --> 36:53.630
potentially creating severe civil unrest."

36:55.257 --> 36:56.300
It's uncanny, isn't it?

36:56.842 --> 36:58.969
He even suggests a solution.

36:59.052 --> 37:03.932
Take the five percent of the world's GDP
that goes towards fossil fuel subsidies

37:04.016 --> 37:06.018
and, of course, the likes of IOP,

37:06.101 --> 37:09.646
- and put that into decarbonization.
- It's really not my--

37:09.730 --> 37:11.607
Area of expertise, right.

37:11.690 --> 37:14.610
- If we knew then what we know now--
- This report would have been published?

37:16.111 --> 37:19.323
I think I've made it clear
that was never my decision to make.

37:20.324 --> 37:23.744
It's also important to be clear
that IOP today--

37:23.827 --> 37:25.329
Many would say that, given this,

37:25.412 --> 37:31.835
whatever they are doing today
is way too little, way too late.

37:41.220 --> 37:44.598
I'm here as a mom, Nancy.

37:46.642 --> 37:48.101
Just a mom.

37:49.978 --> 37:52.940
I love my son, and I want him back.

37:55.108 --> 37:57.486
That much I don't doubt, Katherine.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.614
Thank you for your time.

38:00.697 --> 38:04.451
All right, get ready.
Here we go. Let's go.

38:09.915 --> 38:11.458
And we're clear.

38:25.013 --> 38:27.516
Wow.
Nancy, that was quite something.

38:32.980 --> 38:33.981
Hey,

38:35.691 --> 38:38.277
this just came in
from Gloucestershire constabulary.

38:39.236 --> 38:40.404
Cresswell.

38:41.572 --> 38:42.698
It's him.

38:46.618 --> 38:48.328
How did she get that paper?

38:48.412 --> 38:50.414
- Somebody must have sent it.
- Who?

38:50.956 --> 38:52.082
How? Nobody had access.

38:52.165 --> 38:55.085
How does taking Leo help save
the goddamn planet?

38:55.169 --> 38:57.671
This isn't about fucking climate change.

38:57.754 --> 38:58.881
It could have been anything.

38:58.964 --> 39:00.591
This is about the truth.

39:01.175 --> 39:03.844
Things have changed, and we didn't notice.

39:04.344 --> 39:07.306
They took Leo
to show us that things have changed,

39:07.389 --> 39:09.766
and we didn't even fucking notice.

39:09.850 --> 39:12.394
I told you it was a risk.

39:14.313 --> 39:16.148
So, what aren't you telling me?

39:17.357 --> 39:19.318
We'll be lucky to be left
with a single client.

39:19.401 --> 39:22.237
What don't I know, Martin?

39:23.322 --> 39:24.364
What are you talking about?

39:25.991 --> 39:27.034
What did you do?

39:28.285 --> 39:29.286
I've done--

39:31.496 --> 39:32.706
What did I--

39:35.918 --> 39:37.211
This is us, Kate.

39:37.294 --> 39:38.962
Me and you.

39:40.130 --> 39:43.425
The UK suspects, what's your connection?

39:46.345 --> 39:48.805
Listen, there's plenty you don't know,

39:48.889 --> 39:50.766
but only because
that's the way you wanted it.

39:50.849 --> 39:52.809
Whatever I did, you did too.

39:52.893 --> 39:55.687
You need to tell me
everything you know about Leo.

39:55.771 --> 39:57.105
I know as much as you.

40:04.321 --> 40:05.656
You don't believe me.

40:11.161 --> 40:12.579
You don't believe me.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.477
You've reached
Special Agent Owen Neilssen.

40:35.561 --> 40:37.187
Leave a message,
and I'll get right back to you.

40:37.271 --> 40:40.232
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

40:40.315 --> 40:42.943
And we're here at the hotel…

40:43.026 --> 40:44.278
Tell the truth!

40:44.361 --> 40:49.366
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

40:49.449 --> 40:52.077
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

41:14.099 --> 41:17.352
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

41:18.562 --> 41:19.855
I see him.

41:33.660 --> 41:35.204
Go!

41:37.414 --> 41:40.709
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.

41:44.463 --> 41:45.464
Go on.

41:50.636 --> 41:52.804
You heard them. Tell the truth.

42:04.566 --> 42:06.360
Mr. Cresswell,

42:06.443 --> 42:08.654
we have some questions
we need to ask you, sir,

42:08.737 --> 42:10.072
about Leo Newman.

42:11.615 --> 42:13.116
And while it remains to be seen

42:13.200 --> 42:16.453
whether that performance is enough
to secure the release of her son,

42:16.537 --> 42:19.373
it's done nothing to enhance
Katherine Newman's reputation

42:19.456 --> 42:21.542
or that of the industry she represents.

42:22.042 --> 42:24.628
PR specialists prefer
to maintain a low profile

42:24.711 --> 42:26.296
and operate behind the scenes,

42:26.380 --> 42:29.800
so becoming the story will be
uncomfortable for Ms. Newman,

42:29.883 --> 42:33.971
even without the gnawing fear that
all this could be too little, too late.

42:34.054 --> 42:36.473
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

42:36.557 --> 42:38.976
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

42:39.059 --> 42:44.731
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!
Tell the truth! Tell the truth!

42:45.941 --> 42:49.862
- I have nothing to say to any of you.
- Transfer my money.

42:49.945 --> 42:51.905
- Now.
- Why us?

42:51.989 --> 42:53.240
What are you talking about?

42:54.700 --> 42:55.784
You were gonna kill us.

42:55.868 --> 42:58.745
My job is to protect the company

42:58.829 --> 43:01.665
by neutralizing anything
that could harm our reputation.

43:01.748 --> 43:05.002
You could have all done real damage.

43:05.085 --> 43:06.336
Still can.

43:06.420 --> 43:07.421
Who took Leo Newman?

43:10.674 --> 43:12.301
- You tell me.
- Stop lying.

43:12.384 --> 43:13.427
Why would I lie?

43:14.845 --> 43:16.180
I have nothing left to protect.

43:17.890 --> 43:22.561
If anybody knows where Leo is,
it's at least one of you.

43:24.229 --> 43:25.230
Isn't it?

43:30.485 --> 43:31.945
You don't even trust each other.

43:32.029 --> 43:34.031
Just tell us the truth, man.

43:34.114 --> 43:37.034
If I had all the answers,
why would I send a plane to England?

43:37.117 --> 43:39.786
Get my fucking money! Hey!

43:40.370 --> 43:42.247
- Where is Leo?
- Nobody had to die.

43:44.291 --> 43:45.375
The truth is--
