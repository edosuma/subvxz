00:29.396 --> 00:31.694
(water sloshing)

00:34.634 --> 00:37.535
(gasps and coughs)

00:37.604 --> 00:39.765
(eerie whispering)

00:42.075 --> 00:43.770
Oh!

00:44.778 --> 00:47.076
Ow!

00:49.616 --> 00:52.244
(screaming)
Help! Help!

00:52.318 --> 00:53.546
Am I dead?

00:53.620 --> 00:56.214
(distorted Southern male voice):
You're not dead.

00:56.289 --> 00:58.655
You've been taken
against your will.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.625
Kobe? Who is that?

01:00.693 --> 01:03.821
(electrical crackling)

01:05.364 --> 01:08.266
Dr. Phil?
What the hell's going on?

01:08.334 --> 01:12.031
I don't know. I was doing a show
on teens with abandonment issues...

01:12.105 --> 01:13.834
and suddenly, I woke up here.

01:13.907 --> 01:17.001
Man, those kids
are gonna be pissed.

01:17.077 --> 01:18.271
(static crackles)

01:18.344 --> 01:19.936
MALE VOICE:
Hello, gentlemen.

01:20.013 --> 01:22.573
You don't know me,
but I know you.

01:22.649 --> 01:25.880
You both play games
with other people for a living...

01:25.952 --> 01:28.853
but, today, you play a game
for your lives.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.790
Right now, you are both
breathing in a deadly nerve gas.

01:32.859 --> 01:35.828
You have 120 seconds to reach
the antidote...

01:35.895 --> 01:37.192
or you die.

01:37.263 --> 01:39.288
Oh, my God!
We better get out of here!

01:39.365 --> 01:41.458
Let the game begin.

01:41.534 --> 01:42.523
(static crackles)

01:42.602 --> 01:44.467
There!

01:51.277 --> 01:54.212
Hit the metal arm
with something.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.872
There.

02:05.058 --> 02:08.118
- (gasps, grunts)
- Damn it!

02:09.062 --> 02:10.723
Sorry.

02:10.797 --> 02:14.130
Shaquille, I'm not angry at you...

02:14.200 --> 02:17.033
but we are one minute
away from death.

02:17.103 --> 02:19.503
Just shut out the "No" voice.

02:19.572 --> 02:22.006
Own your success.

02:25.645 --> 02:26.839
Oh!

02:28.281 --> 02:31.580
Just make the damn basket!

02:34.320 --> 02:35.981
What the hell was that for?

02:36.055 --> 02:37.750
You hurt my feelings.

02:37.824 --> 02:40.884
Your feelings?
To hell with your feelings!

02:40.960 --> 02:43.087
Everybody with their feelings!

02:43.163 --> 02:46.189
(whining) "I'm obese."
"My kid's a brat." "Help me. Help me."

02:46.266 --> 02:47.528
Just shut up!

02:47.600 --> 02:49.591
(crying)
Why can't I fix anyone?

02:49.669 --> 02:54.129
I'm so dumb and worthless!
Mama was right! Mama was right!

02:54.207 --> 02:57.904
Hey, hey! Pull yourself together.
You're a brilliant doctor.

02:57.977 --> 03:00.002
(sniffling)
Not exactly.

03:00.079 --> 03:04.209
- What?
- L-I just tell people to "get real."

03:04.284 --> 03:06.718
I'm not even a psychologist.

03:06.786 --> 03:08.515
I'm... an electrician.

03:09.689 --> 03:13.022
I failed you, Shaq.
I failed you.

03:21.334 --> 03:22.892
- Booyah!
- Yes!

03:26.272 --> 03:27.864
DR. PHI L:
30 seconds left!

03:27.941 --> 03:29.909
(Shaq screams)

03:30.677 --> 03:33.145
This will never work.

03:33.213 --> 03:36.273
Of course- he wants us
to cut through our feet.

03:37.450 --> 03:39.384
You go first.

03:39.452 --> 03:41.750
Bullshit.

03:41.821 --> 03:43.755
Yeah.

03:43.823 --> 03:45.814
You're probably not man enough.

03:45.892 --> 03:47.587
I guess your mama was right.

03:49.829 --> 03:51.387
Never!

03:51.464 --> 03:54.797
Who's the coward now, Mama?
(grunts)

03:54.867 --> 03:56.801
Candy from a baby.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.632
(whimpering)

04:00.540 --> 04:03.998
- Oh, my God!
- I did it. We're saved.

04:04.077 --> 04:06.637
- What's wrong?
- Wrong foot.

04:10.817 --> 04:12.444
Motherfu-

04:13.953 --> 04:16.444
(heavy metal rock music plays)

04:24.998 --> 04:26.761
JAMES EARLJONES:
No one believed

04:26.833 --> 04:29.563
in the early years
of the 21 st century

04:29.636 --> 04:31.661
that our world was being
watched...

04:31.738 --> 04:35.640
the way a man with a microscope
might scrutinize the creatures

04:35.708 --> 04:37.471
in a drop of water.

04:37.543 --> 04:39.841
# I like big butts
and I cannot lie #

04:39.912 --> 04:41.675
#You other brothers can't deny #

04:41.748 --> 04:43.682
#That when a girl walks in
with an itty-bitty waist #

04:43.750 --> 04:47.379
#And round thing in your face,
you get sprung #

04:47.453 --> 04:50.251
#Wanna pull up tough
'Cause you noticed that butt was stuffed #

04:50.323 --> 04:51.915
# Deep in the jeans she's wearin' #

04:51.991 --> 04:53.925
# I'm hooked,
and I can't stop starin' #

04:53.993 --> 04:56.223
# Oh, baby #

04:56.296 --> 04:58.059
(song fades)

04:58.131 --> 05:01.123
JONES:
Yet across the gulf of space

05:01.200 --> 05:04.761
a terrible evil prepared
to unleash itself

05:04.837 --> 05:08.739
upon an unsuspecting human race.

05:08.808 --> 05:10.639
(cars passing, horns honking)

05:21.154 --> 05:24.089
You're up early.
Come back to bed.

05:25.391 --> 05:27.757
Come on.

05:29.395 --> 05:31.090
Please.

05:46.612 --> 05:48.603
(sets picture down)

05:52.585 --> 05:54.576
Hello? Hello?

05:56.489 --> 05:58.389
Tom! Oh!

05:58.458 --> 06:00.221
(groans)

06:00.293 --> 06:04.127
I know you missed me.
Oh, I missed you too. God, you look great.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.688
I wanted to come by to thank you
for setting up that job interview for me.

06:06.766 --> 06:10.293
This isn't a good time.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.930
I just need something to keep me busy
now that Cody's out of the house.

06:13.005 --> 06:14.973
He just turned 11.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.770
I enrolled him in military
school last year.

06:16.843 --> 06:19.107
It's supposed to be
a great program.

06:19.178 --> 06:22.238
Boy, kids, you know,
they just grow up so fast.

06:22.315 --> 06:24.783
So I heard
that you were dating again.

06:24.851 --> 06:27.081
Knowing you,
I bet she's brainy.

06:27.153 --> 06:28.643
"Quixotic."

06:28.721 --> 06:30.348
90 points!

06:30.423 --> 06:32.414
(whooping, giggling)

06:43.936 --> 06:47.064
Oh, you know, your work with
the elderly really inspired me, Tom.

06:47.140 --> 06:50.769
I mean, they have
so much to teach us...

06:50.843 --> 06:52.970
and we have so much
to teach them.

06:53.045 --> 06:55.980
You know, ultimately, they...
really are just like us...

06:56.048 --> 06:58.608
only... older.

06:58.684 --> 07:02.176
Anyway, I'm hoping that
a new career will help

07:02.255 --> 07:05.782
keep my mind off of...
bad memories.

07:05.858 --> 07:10.022
I'm sure you have memories, too.
He's the kind of person you never forget.

07:10.096 --> 07:12.121
Sometimes, I wake up in
the middle of the night

07:12.198 --> 07:14.928
wondering where he is,
and then I remember.

07:15.001 --> 07:19.461
I know you miss him, too,
but it's really been hardest on me.

07:19.539 --> 07:21.507
I'm rattling on, but if you
don't vent your emotions...

07:21.574 --> 07:25.237
they just well up inside of you
and burst out.

07:25.311 --> 07:28.041
The harder you try,
the harder it all gets...

07:28.114 --> 07:30.412
till you just can't
shake it off anymore.

07:30.483 --> 07:31.472
Oh!

07:31.551 --> 07:34.543
Like you're carrying around
this enormous burden.

07:34.620 --> 07:36.645
Sometimes your problems
get so big.

07:36.722 --> 07:38.212
(meows, screeches)

07:38.291 --> 07:39.485
(screams)

07:39.559 --> 07:42.027
- And then what do you say to yourself?
- Jesus!

07:42.094 --> 07:45.495
Yes, you can turn to religion
or family and friends...

07:45.565 --> 07:48.159
but in the end,
you're still in agony.

07:48.234 --> 07:50.725
Maybe that's why
I want to become a nurse.

07:50.803 --> 07:54.705
I'm just- I'm so in tune
with everyone's emotions.

07:54.774 --> 07:57.504
I guess I've always had
a knack for being-

07:57.577 --> 07:59.340
(screaming, then splat)

07:59.412 --> 08:01.175
Oh, my-

08:08.387 --> 08:09.718
(wind whistling)

08:17.697 --> 08:19.665
(seagulls screeching)

08:19.732 --> 08:21.825
(engine rumbling)

08:26.606 --> 08:29.905
MAN: Ryan, go home.
You've been working 16 straight hours.

08:29.976 --> 08:32.240
Come on, I need the overtime.

08:32.311 --> 08:34.211
Don't worry. Okay?

08:34.280 --> 08:36.748
I'm wide-

08:36.816 --> 08:38.784
(alarm buzzes)

08:38.851 --> 08:43.288
MAN:
Ryan! What are you doing?

08:44.757 --> 08:47.157
That was gold bullion-

08:49.295 --> 08:51.286
No, not the monkeys!

08:51.364 --> 08:53.696
(toots)

08:56.602 --> 08:59.070
- (screeching)
- MAN: They're loose!

08:59.138 --> 09:03.268
(ship's horn bellows)

09:03.342 --> 09:05.674
Damn it, Tom!
What the hell happened back there?

09:05.745 --> 09:07.838
Aw, come on, Ed.
That could've happened to anyone.

09:07.914 --> 09:10.508
Oh, yeah?
You know what your problem is?

09:10.583 --> 09:13.643
As soon as the going gets tough,
you give up.

09:13.719 --> 09:16.085
You're right. I quit.

09:16.155 --> 09:17.816
Ah, you don't get it, do you?

09:17.890 --> 09:20.859
You could be the best,
if only you'd see things through.

09:20.927 --> 09:23.418
- I don't know.
- Give me a break.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.624
What can I tell you, Ed?
I guess I'm no good.

09:26.699 --> 09:28.428
- Maybe I just don't have what it takes.
- (hooting)

09:28.501 --> 09:32.403
What are you talking about?
You secured that tricky H-500 unit, didn't you?

09:32.471 --> 09:34.268
Aw, come on. That was easy.

09:37.009 --> 09:39.842
(rockabilly music plays)

09:42.582 --> 09:44.982
Tom Ryan.
I haven't seen you in a while.

09:45.051 --> 09:49.249
Well, I spend every waking minute
of my life operating a crane.

09:49.322 --> 09:51.313
God, I hate my job.

09:56.028 --> 09:58.087
Yo, Tom! Where you been?

09:58.164 --> 09:59.654
Mahalik.

09:59.732 --> 10:01.563
Yo, C.J.,
this is my boy Tom Ryan.

10:01.634 --> 10:03.795
We used to work together
down at the docks.

10:03.869 --> 10:05.029
Ya-hi! Ya-hi! Ya-hi!

10:05.104 --> 10:07.766
- Hey, Tom. How's the family, man?
- You remember Marilyn?

10:07.840 --> 10:10.365
- Your lovely wife- how could I forget?
- She dumped me.

10:10.443 --> 10:13.378
Yeah, I know.
I slept with her a few times.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.879
- What?
- Me too.

10:14.947 --> 10:17.973
You guys talking about Marilyn?
Great lay.

10:18.050 --> 10:20.314
My pops introduced me to her.

10:20.386 --> 10:22.411
Ever since the divorce,
it's like my life has no purpose.

10:22.488 --> 10:24.285
Half the time I walk around
feeling like a zombie.

10:24.357 --> 10:26.723
Yo, don't joke about zombies.
That shit there- that's real.

10:26.792 --> 10:29.226
Yo, you know Nashawn,
down on 120th Street?

10:29.295 --> 10:30.284
Yeah.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.127
She told me that she heard a zombie
going through her trash the other day.

10:33.199 --> 10:35.030
The next morning,
she turned up missing.

10:35.101 --> 10:37.228
- Uh-
- What? Okay, back up.

10:37.303 --> 10:39.237
How in the hell
do you "turn up missing"?

10:39.305 --> 10:42.001
'Cause nobody knows where you are
when they realize you ain't there!

10:42.074 --> 10:43.336
Guys, I'm trying to ask-

10:43.409 --> 10:46.503
So you telling me that you can appear
and disappear at the same time.

10:46.579 --> 10:49.104
No, man. You can't appear
and disappear at the same time.

10:49.181 --> 10:51.206
- The bitch ain't David Copperfield!
- Uh, guys-

10:51.283 --> 10:52.682
Mmm. No, no.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.186
But you can't be gone from one place
and show up somewhere else entirely.

10:55.254 --> 10:57.245
So when you turn up,
you're never missing.

10:57.323 --> 10:59.689
And when you're missing,
you never turn up.

10:59.759 --> 11:02.387
Unless... you a zombie.

11:02.461 --> 11:03.894
Damn!

11:03.963 --> 11:06.898
Hey, that's some plausible shit right there.
You should blog about that.

11:06.966 --> 11:09.867
- I'm gonna put that on MySpace.
- You do that!

11:09.935 --> 11:11.596
(grunts)
Hey, Tom.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.697
You know what you need to do, man?
You need to get away from all this.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.675
- You need to take a break.
- Oh, I don't know.

11:17.743 --> 11:21.235
No, no. He's right, man. You should
come fishing with us one weekend.

11:21.313 --> 11:24.282
Me and Mahalik, we found
this great spot last summer.

11:24.350 --> 11:26.682
Yeah. A great spot.

11:29.588 --> 11:31.317
(sheep bleating)

11:33.993 --> 11:36.291
Hey. You cold?

11:38.030 --> 11:40.260
- L-Little bit.
- Hmm.

11:48.641 --> 11:50.438
Hey. Look, man, um-

11:50.509 --> 11:52.374
I'm not on the down-low
or nothing, all right?

11:52.445 --> 11:55.881
Oh, that's cool, man.
Me, neither.

11:59.185 --> 12:01.449
- Hey, what you doing?
- Relax, man.

12:01.520 --> 12:03.954
I'm just trying to grab some nuts.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.754
C.J., what are you doin'?

12:13.833 --> 12:16.461
- I just wanna eat some peanuts.
- Huh?

12:16.535 --> 12:19.868
See? Peanuts.

12:27.780 --> 12:33.844
# I've been alone with you
inside my mind #

12:33.919 --> 12:36.945
#And in my dreams,
I've kissed your lips #

12:38.390 --> 12:40.915
(whispering)
#A thousand times #

12:42.161 --> 12:48.657
# I sometimes see you pass
outside my door #

12:48.734 --> 12:51.965
BOTH:
# Hello #

12:52.037 --> 12:55.529
# Is it me you're looking for? #

12:55.608 --> 12:59.601
# I can see it in your eyes #

12:59.678 --> 13:02.943
# I can see it in your smile #

13:03.015 --> 13:06.280
#You're all I ever wanted #

13:06.352 --> 13:09.685
#And my arms are open wide #

13:09.755 --> 13:12.053
# 'Cause you know just what to say #

13:12.124 --> 13:14.319
(sighs)

13:14.393 --> 13:17.123
#And you know just what to do #

13:17.196 --> 13:19.391
Ooh, baby.

13:19.465 --> 13:22.696
#And I want to tell you so much #

13:22.768 --> 13:23.928
(crackles)

13:26.138 --> 13:28.800
BOTH:
# I love you. #

13:28.874 --> 13:31.968
(rattling)

13:33.145 --> 13:35.238
Yeah...
we caught a lot of fish.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.804
Yeah.

13:36.882 --> 13:38.372
(inhales deeply)

13:38.450 --> 13:40.315
Black cod.

13:40.386 --> 13:42.479
Damn.

13:42.555 --> 13:45.456
Tom, you don't-
I don't want you thinking that-

13:45.524 --> 13:47.355
Hopefully, this doesn't
affect your opin-

13:47.426 --> 13:49.724
Why would you do that,
and that's my first time meeting him?

13:49.795 --> 13:52.286
(tires screeching)

13:52.364 --> 13:54.855
(rock music blares from radio)

13:59.271 --> 14:01.899
(music stops)

14:01.974 --> 14:04.272
(sighs)
Late again, Tom.

14:04.343 --> 14:07.540
- Hey, Marilyn.
- I thought you were moving.

14:07.613 --> 14:11.515
It's all I can afford right now. You took
everything in the divorce except my name.

14:11.584 --> 14:13.848
No, actually, the judge
granted me that yesterday.

14:13.919 --> 14:16.217
You're now officially known
as "Horace P. MacTitties."

14:17.456 --> 14:20.357
I'm sure your new husband is pleased.

14:20.426 --> 14:23.088
He's a good man.
A provider, unlike you.

14:23.162 --> 14:24.993
You never cared
about our children.

14:25.064 --> 14:27.555
Hey, that's not true.
I'm a great dad.

14:27.633 --> 14:30.101
Kids!

14:30.169 --> 14:31.193
Dad?

14:37.343 --> 14:39.208
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, Rachel.

14:39.278 --> 14:42.042
How's it going there,
uh... Princess?

14:43.048 --> 14:44.913
- (door knob rattling)
- It's locked.

14:48.153 --> 14:49.677
Hey! Let me help you
with that, muffin.

14:49.755 --> 14:51.245
- I should do that.
- It's no problem.

14:51.323 --> 14:53.314
- I honestly don't mind.
- Neither do I.

14:53.392 --> 14:55.257
- Fine. You take it.
- (screaming)

14:55.327 --> 14:57.727
I'll see you on Tuesday.

14:57.796 --> 14:59.127
Hey, Marilyn.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.429
That's a good look for you,
being pregnant.

15:03.836 --> 15:06.100
I'm not pregnant!

15:06.171 --> 15:09.163
I didn't meant to-
I'm sorry.

15:09.241 --> 15:12.108
If you want to make things right,
maybe you should start with our kids.

15:12.177 --> 15:15.112
You're right. Those kids
are all I have in this world.

15:15.180 --> 15:17.842
Well, the kids... and my car.

15:17.917 --> 15:20.579
(Rachel grunting)
Ow!

15:23.222 --> 15:27.249
Mr. Koji, looks like we need
someone new for the Norris account.

15:27.326 --> 15:28.816
Again?

15:28.894 --> 15:31.954
Every day we don't have someone looking
after this woman, I lose big money.

15:32.031 --> 15:35.489
- What happened to last girl?
- Yoko. Take a look.

15:35.567 --> 15:38.001
MR. KOJl:
Holy shit!

15:38.070 --> 15:40.664
Someone put a towel under her
or something. Christ!

15:40.739 --> 15:44.641
It's the Norris house, Mr. Koji.
They say it's cursed.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.701
There no such thing as a curse.

15:46.779 --> 15:48.440
Don't be ridiculous.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.880
Those just old wives' tales.

15:50.950 --> 15:54.613
I need someone there today
or I'm in big trouble.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.177
(doorbell jingles)

15:57.623 --> 15:59.614
Hello. I'm Cindy Campbell.

15:59.692 --> 16:01.956
I'm looking for a job
in home health care.

16:03.395 --> 16:05.886
I was recommended by a family friend,
but unfortunately, he committed-

16:05.965 --> 16:08.729
Oh, my God!

16:08.801 --> 16:10.860
Don't mind her.
She slip and fall.

16:10.936 --> 16:14.235
You my new best employee.
Ready start today?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.240
Oh, it's so fast. I don't know.

16:16.308 --> 16:18.572
Oh, trust me.
Uh, you're gonna love this job.

16:18.644 --> 16:21.078
Come on, I show you.
We can be there 10 minutes.

16:26.618 --> 16:28.609
(wind whooshing)

16:33.325 --> 16:35.259
Come! Come!

16:45.904 --> 16:48.600
Mr. Koji?

16:50.943 --> 16:53.707
Hello?

16:57.783 --> 17:00.445
(squeaking)

17:03.756 --> 17:06.054
Oh, my God! Oh!

17:06.125 --> 17:07.455
Okay, oh.

17:07.526 --> 17:09.892
- Oh, let's get you up and-
- Oh!

17:09.962 --> 17:12.556
Okay, come on.
Here we go.

17:12.631 --> 17:15.259
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- There you are.

17:15.334 --> 17:17.131
I see you've met Mrs. Norris-
she catatonic.

17:17.202 --> 17:19.670
Yes, I was just trying
to get her back up on the bed.

17:19.738 --> 17:21.797
I was afraid
that she would be hurt.

17:21.874 --> 17:24.069
You know, when I came in,
I just saw her lying here on the floor.

17:24.143 --> 17:26.873
Of course, of course. I help.
You grab her legs, I grab her arms.

17:26.944 --> 17:29.243
Mrs. Norris,
I'm here to take care of you.

17:29.314 --> 17:30.474
(whimpering)

17:30.549 --> 17:33.143
Yes, I'm very happy
to meet you, too.

17:33.218 --> 17:34.742
(groaning)

17:34.820 --> 17:38.221
See? This job perfect for you.
Let me show you rest of house.

17:38.290 --> 17:40.383
Right this way.

17:40.459 --> 17:42.427
So, what do you think?

17:42.494 --> 17:48.399
I don't know. There's something
strange about this house.

17:48.467 --> 17:51.231
- A presence.
- A presence? Don't be silly.

17:51.303 --> 17:53.066
- Nothing wrong with this house.
- It's funny.

17:53.138 --> 17:56.574
I always dreamt I would live
in a house like this with my husband...

17:56.642 --> 17:59.770
but I guess that's all just in the...

18:01.046 --> 18:02.104
past.

18:02.181 --> 18:04.274
Who wants to see upstairs?

18:05.350 --> 18:08.615
It's a nice neighborhood
close to schools and shopping.

18:08.687 --> 18:12.123
There are hardwood floors throughout.
Passed almost every inspection.

18:12.191 --> 18:15.752
Big backyard goes back 100 feet.

18:15.828 --> 18:17.819
(Mr. Koji continues indistinctly)

18:21.333 --> 18:23.301
And in here is the bathroom.

18:23.368 --> 18:24.995
Very big, very...

18:26.672 --> 18:28.833
nice.

18:28.907 --> 18:30.465
It is nice.

18:30.542 --> 18:32.772
It seems like
it'd be a great place to work...

18:32.845 --> 18:35.643
but I just can't shake
this feeling of... evil.

18:35.714 --> 18:37.682
Evil? That crazy talk.

18:42.421 --> 18:44.981
Do you know anything about
the people who used to live here?

18:45.057 --> 18:48.686
People? No, nothing about people.
I don't remember anything.

18:48.760 --> 18:52.196
Mr. Koji, did something strange
happen in this house?

18:52.264 --> 18:53.856
Strange? Don't be silly.

18:53.932 --> 18:55.832
This house perfectly normal.

18:55.901 --> 18:59.667
I'm sure you're right, and yet...
it's as if someone's watching us.

18:59.738 --> 19:02.639
(screeching)

19:02.708 --> 19:04.699
Mr. Koji?

19:04.776 --> 19:08.143
That was me...
just excited about hiring you.

19:08.213 --> 19:11.148
Very, very enthusiastic!

19:11.216 --> 19:16.916
We offer medical and dental
and two weeks' paid vacation!

19:16.989 --> 19:20.516
I'm hoping...
you can start today!

19:20.592 --> 19:22.651
Maybe get in a whole week!

19:22.728 --> 19:24.423
You put in for this job...

19:24.496 --> 19:26.691
we got wonderful opportunities for you.
(screams)

19:26.765 --> 19:30.223
Mr. Koji, is there something
you're not telling me about this?

19:33.472 --> 19:35.633
(gurgling)

19:35.707 --> 19:38.870
I was... dirty.

19:40.179 --> 19:44.013
So... the job?

19:44.082 --> 19:45.709
I'll take it.

19:48.120 --> 19:50.418
(yowls)

19:50.956 --> 19:53.789
TOM: Get your glove!
I'm in the backyard!

19:53.859 --> 19:56.794
Robbie, come on.
Let's go!

19:56.862 --> 19:59.695
That's not how you're going
to get through to him.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.960
Look, Rach, this is guy stuff.

20:02.034 --> 20:05.231
- You got to trust me.
- (sighs)

20:05.304 --> 20:08.239
All right, Robbie, you ready
for the <i>Tom Ryan Express?</i>

20:18.650 --> 20:22.086
Yeah, maybe, one day,
I can grow up to be just like you.

20:22.154 --> 20:25.214
All right,
I know I let you kids down...

20:25.290 --> 20:27.986
but you have no idea
how hard it is to be a father.

20:28.060 --> 20:31.655
Well, when you start,
let me know.

20:41.073 --> 20:42.768
You okay?

20:42.841 --> 20:44.433
My eyes! My eyes!

20:44.509 --> 20:48.001
(panting)

20:48.080 --> 20:52.244
Oh, much... better.

20:53.352 --> 20:55.445
- I'm so sorry.
- Oh, that's okay.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.647
I've taken balls
to the face before.

20:57.723 --> 21:00.521
Hi. I'm Cindy Campbell,
your new neighbor.

21:00.592 --> 21:02.560
Tom, Tom Ryan.

21:02.628 --> 21:05.096
You, uh, live here
all by yourself?

21:05.163 --> 21:07.154
Well, I'm-I'm taking care
of Mrs. Norris...

21:07.232 --> 21:10.963
but... yes, for the first time
in my life, I'm on my own.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.469
I know that feeling.

21:13.538 --> 21:16.837
- It wasn't always that way.
- I know.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.035
You thought you'd found
your soul mate.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.045
Yes.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.104
And then one day
you come home...

21:23.181 --> 21:26.480
and find your so-called soul mate
in bed with a complete stranger.

21:26.551 --> 21:29.816
Well, not a complete stranger-
Sammy Sosa.

21:31.023 --> 21:33.150
Sound familiar?

21:34.760 --> 21:36.352
No, not at all.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.596
But I do know what it's like
to be in that much pain...

21:39.665 --> 21:42.498
and the worst part is
you have to suffer through it-

21:42.567 --> 21:44.967
- Alone?
- It looks like we have a lot in-

21:45.037 --> 21:47.505
Common.

21:47.572 --> 21:50.268
- We're already finishing each other's-
- Dinner.

21:51.610 --> 21:53.771
Sentences.

21:54.946 --> 21:58.973
Well... maybe all we really need
is a friend.

21:59.051 --> 22:01.611
I'd like that.

22:01.687 --> 22:03.951
Well, I better get back
to Mrs. Norris.

22:04.022 --> 22:06.490
It's time to put her catheter in,
and then after that...

22:06.558 --> 22:08.549
I've got to scrub
in between her fat folds...

22:08.627 --> 22:10.754
and I've got to lance her boils.

22:10.829 --> 22:12.592
I've got to open her up
and then-

22:12.664 --> 22:15.258
(voice fades out
under light, romantic theme)

22:43.328 --> 22:45.592
...empty the colostomy bag and...

22:45.664 --> 22:47.859
(sighs)
Mop up the drool.

22:47.933 --> 22:49.798
That's wonderful.

22:49.868 --> 22:52.530
- I'll see you around?
- Definitely.

22:52.604 --> 22:54.697
Okay.
(giggles)

22:56.274 --> 22:58.765
Okay, Mrs. Norris,
time to dig out that doody bubble.

22:58.844 --> 23:00.038
(gurgling, suctioning)

23:00.645 --> 23:02.943
(water running)

23:10.956 --> 23:12.685
(gasps)

23:12.758 --> 23:15.352
(panting)

23:22.000 --> 23:24.161
(sighs)

23:24.236 --> 23:25.726
(humming)

23:30.275 --> 23:33.301
(gasps)

23:33.378 --> 23:35.539
(gasping)

23:35.614 --> 23:39.175
(door creaking)

23:55.634 --> 23:57.898
(crackling and thumping)

24:02.441 --> 24:03.772
(gasps)

24:03.842 --> 24:06.936
Whoa... Oh! Ow!

24:07.012 --> 24:09.776
(clattering)

24:13.318 --> 24:15.309
(crickets chirping)

24:22.861 --> 24:24.886
- Mrs. Norris?
- (whines)

24:24.963 --> 24:27.523
Have you noticed anything
strange about this house?

24:27.599 --> 24:30.534
- (muffled) Yes! Yes!
- No?

24:30.602 --> 24:31.569
(muffled)
Yes!

24:31.636 --> 24:34.434
Oh, you're probably right.
Guess I'm just being silly.

24:34.506 --> 24:36.565
- (groans)
- (chuckling)

24:36.641 --> 24:38.472
Just relax now.

24:38.543 --> 24:41.273
- Here we go. Okay.
- (mutters)

24:41.346 --> 24:44.577
Oh, you poor thing.
You don't have to be scared.

24:44.649 --> 24:47.743
I'm here to take care of you.

24:47.819 --> 24:51.186
You know, I think you and I
are going to be wonderful friends.

24:51.256 --> 24:55.056
- (groaning)
- I do. That's right. Just relax.

24:55.126 --> 24:57.526
Let's get in those ears.

24:57.596 --> 25:00.463
Okay. All right.

25:00.532 --> 25:04.161
That's right.
Oh, it feels good.

25:04.236 --> 25:06.261
(retching)

25:06.338 --> 25:08.806
Okay.

25:08.874 --> 25:11.365
You love this, don't you?

25:11.443 --> 25:14.742
It's nice and warm.
Feels good, doesn't it?

25:15.313 --> 25:17.975
Oh, my God! Oh! Oh!

25:18.049 --> 25:20.415
I'm so sorry!

25:20.485 --> 25:22.419
(shrieks, then body thuds)

25:22.487 --> 25:24.682
(screeches)

25:24.756 --> 25:26.485
(grunting)

25:26.558 --> 25:29.049
(clattering)

25:32.831 --> 25:37.200
(creaking)

25:44.276 --> 25:45.971
(yowling)

25:48.380 --> 25:50.780
(screeching)

26:14.472 --> 26:17.339
(low, guttural sounds)

26:25.250 --> 26:27.013
(shrieking)

26:34.759 --> 26:37.421
(panting)

26:39.497 --> 26:42.398
Robbie!

26:42.467 --> 26:44.401
Come on!

26:44.469 --> 26:46.733
Let's toss the old pigskin!

26:46.805 --> 26:49.365
(mouthing word)

26:51.977 --> 26:53.911
(gasps, then thud)

26:53.979 --> 26:55.537
Ooh.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.515
I'm so sorry. I didn't see you there.
Are you all right?

26:58.583 --> 27:01.177
(weakly) It's okay.
My throat cushioned the blow.

27:01.252 --> 27:04.847
Thank God.
I lost my temper. My son's-

27:04.923 --> 27:07.187
What's wrong?
You look scared.

27:07.258 --> 27:09.123
Oh, nothing. It's just-

27:09.194 --> 27:11.628
(sighs) There's something
going on in this house.

27:11.696 --> 27:13.960
Last night, I saw a face.

27:14.032 --> 27:16.694
- Did it have a nose?
- Yes.

27:16.768 --> 27:18.531
That does sound like a face.

27:18.603 --> 27:22.061
And then there was
this weird hand in the shower...

27:22.140 --> 27:24.404
and this horrible thing
on the stairs.

27:24.476 --> 27:26.808
I can't go through
this all again.

27:26.878 --> 27:29.870
Oh, I get it.
There's some other guy.

27:29.948 --> 27:33.111
You still love him, don't you?
I wish you both the best.

27:33.184 --> 27:36.210
Wait! You don't understand.

27:36.287 --> 27:40.155
It's painful to talk about,
but you deserve to know.

27:42.027 --> 27:44.427
I was married once.

27:44.496 --> 27:48.728
- Get out the way, bitch!
- Don't call me no bitch! You ain't shit!

27:48.800 --> 27:50.665
Shut your ass up, snow ho!

27:53.138 --> 27:56.801
Well... actually, married twice.

27:58.576 --> 28:00.635
(voice-over): My husband and I
were living our dream.

28:00.712 --> 28:04.375
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen,
your challenger, Cindy Campbell.

28:04.449 --> 28:06.314
(crowd cheering)

28:06.384 --> 28:09.649
Stay loose, Cindy.
Remember your training. Keep your focus.

28:09.721 --> 28:11.746
(grunts)

28:11.823 --> 28:14.792
Always think, where's
the next punch coming- (shouts)

28:14.859 --> 28:17.487
CI NDY (voice-over):
After 20 fights, I was undefeated.

28:17.562 --> 28:19.689
Only one fighter stood
between me and the belt.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.755
You got this chick.
She's nothing.

28:21.833 --> 28:23.562
ANNOUNCER:
Tiffany Stone!

28:23.635 --> 28:25.125
(crowd booing)

28:29.240 --> 28:30.673
Cindy, listen to me.

28:30.742 --> 28:33.438
I know you're scared, but I believe in you.
You can win this.

28:33.511 --> 28:36.810
And if I do win, George, then will you
tell me what my nickname means?

28:36.881 --> 28:38.815
Yes. I promise.

28:38.883 --> 28:41.613
Okay. Now just stick with the jab
and lead with your right.

28:41.686 --> 28:43.711
Watch your footwork.

28:43.788 --> 28:46.313
- (bell ringing)
- Let's go!

28:46.391 --> 28:49.053
(crowd exclaiming)

28:54.799 --> 28:58.496
Whoa, whoa! You do that one more time,
I'm taking a point off, you hear me?

28:58.570 --> 29:01.004
- (screams)
- (spits)

29:01.072 --> 29:03.973
BOY: I got it, I got it!
Dude, check it out!

29:04.042 --> 29:05.236
(crowd cheering)

29:05.310 --> 29:07.744
(Cindy grunting)

29:07.812 --> 29:09.746
(crowd boos)

29:09.814 --> 29:11.213
(panting)

29:11.282 --> 29:13.978
- I can't take it anymore!
- (groans)

29:17.088 --> 29:19.181
(Cindy grunting)

29:20.391 --> 29:22.052
(crowd exclaiming)

29:22.127 --> 29:24.186
(cheering)

29:24.262 --> 29:26.355
CI NDY (voice-over):
And that's when I lost my cool

29:26.431 --> 29:28.729
and made the biggest mistake
of my life.

29:28.800 --> 29:30.734
Cindy, no!

29:31.970 --> 29:33.437
Ooh, a nickel!

29:33.505 --> 29:37.202
(yelling)

29:40.011 --> 29:43.003
No!

29:54.793 --> 29:57.785
- (crunching)
- (crowd exclaims)

29:59.798 --> 30:02.562
- (crunching)
- (crowd exclaims)

30:04.936 --> 30:07.029
- (crunching)
- (crowd exclaims)

30:08.306 --> 30:11.366
- (crunching)
- (crowd exclaims)

30:11.442 --> 30:14.468
- (whooshing)
- (thwack, then crunch)

30:14.546 --> 30:16.207
(crowd exclaims)

30:16.281 --> 30:17.578
(grunts)

30:18.983 --> 30:21.747
(flesh ripping, then spitting)

30:23.188 --> 30:25.588
MAN:
Get out of the way!

30:25.657 --> 30:27.955
George!

30:28.026 --> 30:31.621
(echoing)
No!

30:31.696 --> 30:35.029
If I hadn't have thrown that punch,
none of it would've happened.

30:35.099 --> 30:37.897
- I blame myself for it all.
- As well you should.

30:37.969 --> 30:41.905
But, Cindy, the past is the past.

30:41.973 --> 30:44.635
Maybe you ought to think
about your future.

30:44.709 --> 30:46.700
If I'm ever going to love again...

30:46.778 --> 30:49.212
it has to be with somebody
who'll be there for me.

30:49.280 --> 30:52.613
Well, I don't have a great track record
in that department. Just ask my son.

30:52.684 --> 30:55.380
I have.
What's an "cock monger"?

30:56.855 --> 30:58.948
Uh... that's not really important.

30:59.023 --> 31:01.548
What matters is
I've let a lot of people down.

31:01.626 --> 31:04.026
Oh.

31:04.095 --> 31:07.258
- I should go.
- Wait!

31:08.833 --> 31:11.859
Maybe I'm just not meant
to be happy...

31:13.638 --> 31:17.199
but something about you
makes me want to try.

31:26.251 --> 31:28.481
(wind whistling)

31:30.722 --> 31:32.917
(wind howling)

31:32.991 --> 31:35.653
(thunder rumbling)

31:35.727 --> 31:37.922
- What's happening?
- I don't know!

31:40.832 --> 31:43.323
Why is the sky so dark?

31:43.401 --> 31:45.494
Why is the wind moving
towards the storm?

31:45.570 --> 31:47.231
(Mrs. Norris grunting)

31:47.305 --> 31:49.773
Why don't any of us have driers?

31:49.841 --> 31:53.299
I've never seen clouds
like that before!

31:53.378 --> 31:55.812
(zapping)

31:55.880 --> 31:57.541
(shrieks)

31:58.883 --> 32:02.046
(panting)

32:02.120 --> 32:04.054
- You okay?
- Yeah.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.056
- Can you believe that thunder?
- No.

32:06.124 --> 32:09.093
That storm is so fierce.
I've never seen anything like it.

32:09.160 --> 32:11.890
- I haven't either.
- Imagine being out there.

32:11.963 --> 32:15.330
(gasps)
That last one sounded really close.

32:15.400 --> 32:18.528
Don't worry- lightning never
strikes in the same place twice.

32:20.505 --> 32:23.303
- Where's Rachel?
- I thought she was with you.

32:23.374 --> 32:25.672
(thunder crashing)

32:27.512 --> 32:29.412
Oh, there you are.

32:37.922 --> 32:40.186
Okay. That's it. We're fine.

32:40.258 --> 32:42.783
That last bolt of lightning
smelled like a-

32:42.860 --> 32:45.021
Giant turd.

32:45.096 --> 32:49.089
Yes, the... lightning.

32:49.167 --> 32:51.658
I'll go look for Robbie.

32:55.506 --> 32:57.599
MAN: Turn it again,
see if it'll start.

32:57.675 --> 33:00.803
MAN 2: I don't know what's going on.
The car's not working, it's just not working.

33:00.878 --> 33:03.870
- (crowd murmuring)
- MOTORCYCLIST: Start!

33:03.948 --> 33:06.280
- Go!
- (bell dings)

33:06.351 --> 33:07.841
(skateboarder grunts)

33:07.919 --> 33:11.355
My bowels have stopped moving!
Why?

33:11.422 --> 33:14.516
- How's it going, Marvin?
- I just had this car working; now it's dead.

33:14.592 --> 33:17.186
- Try changing the solenoid.
- Good idea.

33:17.261 --> 33:19.525
(yelling)
Death to America!

33:19.597 --> 33:21.258
(clicking)

33:21.332 --> 33:23.698
Aw, shit!
(grunts)

33:25.536 --> 33:27.527
(crowd shouting)

33:44.188 --> 33:45.678
MAN:
Run!

33:45.757 --> 33:49.352
(eerie metallic groaning)

33:51.429 --> 33:54.193
(metal creaking)

33:59.337 --> 34:01.771
(deep electronic whirring)

34:01.839 --> 34:03.329
(bell dings)

34:03.408 --> 34:05.342
(chirps, then clicks)

34:05.410 --> 34:08.402
# Karma, karma, karma, karma,
karma chameleon... #

34:08.478 --> 34:09.946
(crowd murmurs approval)

34:10.014 --> 34:11.914
(click, then boom)

34:11.983 --> 34:15.179
- (crowd gasping)
- (whirring)

34:15.253 --> 34:18.245
(deep grinding and whirring)

34:18.322 --> 34:22.053
(low, eerie, metallic groaning)

34:26.797 --> 34:29.062
(crowd screaming)

34:31.235 --> 34:33.601
(screaming)

34:33.670 --> 34:35.228
(shrieks)

34:35.306 --> 34:38.331
Beautiful outfit!

34:38.409 --> 34:40.400
Thanks.
(screams)

34:41.545 --> 34:44.447
- Where's your ride, G?
- Move it, dawg!

34:46.451 --> 34:49.750
(wind whipping)

34:49.821 --> 34:51.755
(rumbling)

34:51.822 --> 34:54.587
(Cindy panting)

34:54.659 --> 34:58.151
(gasps, screams)

35:00.565 --> 35:03.329
Hello?

35:04.535 --> 35:06.469
"Haro"?

35:07.738 --> 35:09.729
Hibachi. Benihana. Teriyaki.

35:09.807 --> 35:13.004
Nagasaki. Okinawa.
Hokkaido. Yokohama.

35:13.077 --> 35:17.013
(sighs)
Karate. Judo. Sumo. Samurai.

35:17.081 --> 35:21.017
Nissan. Honda. Mitsubishi. Subaru.

35:21.085 --> 35:24.919
Hara-kiri. Tsunami.
Kamikaze. Banzai.

35:24.989 --> 35:29.119
Yamaha. Nikon. Casio. Aiwa.

35:30.495 --> 35:34.363
Minolta. Hitachi. Seiko. Toshiba.

35:34.432 --> 35:36.923
Buddha! Shitake kimono!

35:37.001 --> 35:41.870
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

35:41.939 --> 35:43.668
Fujitsu!

35:44.742 --> 35:46.209
(sighs)

35:46.277 --> 35:47.801
(eerie scraping, gurgling)

35:50.448 --> 35:52.814
I can't read that.

35:52.884 --> 35:55.444
(sighs) That's better.

35:58.389 --> 36:00.323
(gasps)

36:00.391 --> 36:02.291
MAN: Let's go, honey!
Let's go! Let's go!

36:03.694 --> 36:05.286
Robbie, Dad's home!

36:05.363 --> 36:07.024
(shrieks)

36:09.233 --> 36:11.565
What is it?
What's going on?

36:11.636 --> 36:13.866
Death.

36:19.410 --> 36:22.038
(blows)

36:22.113 --> 36:23.637
(spits)

36:25.550 --> 36:28.576
- Dad, talk to me. What's happening?
- There's no time to explain.

36:28.653 --> 36:30.382
Alien attack!

36:30.454 --> 36:33.321
Well, actually,
that about sums it up.

36:33.391 --> 36:35.825
Fill this up with food.
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds.

36:37.662 --> 36:41.564
- (gunshot)
- My ass!

36:44.135 --> 36:46.000
(strained)
Penis.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.031
We gotta go.

36:48.105 --> 36:49.595
(screaming)

36:53.277 --> 36:55.438
- Cindy!
- Tom!

36:55.513 --> 36:57.413
- Run for it!
- Where are you going?

36:57.481 --> 37:01.383
Someone's out there, somebody
who knows a way to stop all of this.

37:01.452 --> 37:03.545
- Oh, you wouldn't understand.
- I understand.

37:03.621 --> 37:07.113
- Come with me.
- Oh, I'd like to, but my kids.

37:07.191 --> 37:10.092
I... guess this is good-bye.

37:10.161 --> 37:13.653
When this is all over, promise me that
you'll find me, that you'll never forget me...

37:13.731 --> 37:16.632
that you won't give up
until I'm back in your arms.

37:16.701 --> 37:19.033
- Alive?
- Yes.

37:19.103 --> 37:20.866
I promise.

37:24.442 --> 37:26.069
Good-bye, Cindy.

37:26.143 --> 37:29.374
(gasping, stammering)

37:31.115 --> 37:32.810
Hey, wait!

37:32.883 --> 37:36.614
A solenoid... for luck.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.752
(dog barking)

37:47.298 --> 37:49.789
Marvin!
You put a solenoid in?

37:49.867 --> 37:52.199
Yeah, I got one
from that crackhead over there.

37:52.270 --> 37:53.931
- Get in.
- Why should we?

37:54.005 --> 37:57.839
Because you're my responsibility now,
and like it or not, I'm all you've got.

37:58.409 --> 38:00.877
(screams)
Ow!

38:01.879 --> 38:04.143
- Hey. Hey!
- Thank God.

38:04.215 --> 38:06.342
Hey! What are you doing?

38:06.417 --> 38:09.352
- Get in the car, Marvin.
- Come on, Tom, stop joking around.

38:09.420 --> 38:11.945
Get in the car, Marvin,
or you're gonna die.

38:12.023 --> 38:14.423
Okay, fine.

38:17.328 --> 38:20.195
- No, wait for me to-
- Still locked.

38:20.264 --> 38:22.858
- Why are you reaching at the same time?
- What do you mean?

38:22.933 --> 38:24.730
- All right, on three.
- You counting now?

38:24.802 --> 38:26.827
One, two, three, open the door!

38:26.904 --> 38:29.236
- Okay, on three.
- One, two-

38:29.307 --> 38:31.002
(both)
Three.

38:31.075 --> 38:33.373
- Don't do that. You're trying to annoy me.
- It's still locked.

38:33.444 --> 38:35.435
I'm going on three. One, two-

38:35.513 --> 38:37.105
Don't count when I count.
I have a problem with that.

38:37.181 --> 38:38.978
- What's the matter with you?
- Turn your mouth sideways.

38:39.050 --> 38:41.245
- If you look at me I lose count.
- What are you crazy?

38:41.319 --> 38:43.651
- One, two, three!
- Two, three!

38:43.721 --> 38:46.053
- Don't do it the same time.
- You said "three."

38:46.123 --> 38:47.647
- You go on "four." Can you count?
- Four.

38:47.725 --> 38:50.159
- So on your "three" or my "four"?
- There's only one "three."

38:50.227 --> 38:52.525
- I'm tryin' to get in the car.
- Then you do it on "four."

38:52.596 --> 38:55.292
You said, "three." So are you doin' it
on "three" or am I doin' it on "two"?

38:55.366 --> 38:57.197
- For Christ's sake!
- I heard "three."

38:57.268 --> 38:58.826
If the count is "three,"
you do it on "four."

38:58.903 --> 39:00.495
- Now it's "four."
- Why would you go on "four"?

39:00.571 --> 39:02.436
You gave me "four" first
and you stole my "four."

39:02.506 --> 39:04.167
- But I have to count to "three" first.
- You stole my "four."

39:04.241 --> 39:06.641
- Just let me say "three."
- I've got wait on you now, huh?

39:06.711 --> 39:08.269
- You want the black man to wait again?
- Do whatever you want.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.281
- That's what I've been doin'.
- Why would you do that?

39:11.349 --> 39:13.874
Why would you reach for it when
I say "three"? That's what this is about.

39:13.951 --> 39:15.418
Do I still go on "four"?

39:15.486 --> 39:17.681
When I say "three,"
don't worry about "four."

39:17.755 --> 39:19.188
You got all the time in the world!

39:19.256 --> 39:23.352
You can go home, watch television
and come back and then open the door!

39:23.427 --> 39:24.621
- Fine.
- One-

39:24.695 --> 39:27.255
No. No "one." I'm out.
No thank you.

39:27.331 --> 39:30.892
I'll take the next one.
Does that work for you?

39:30.968 --> 39:33.198
- Jesus.
- Attitude.

39:33.270 --> 39:35.238
(tires screech)

39:35.306 --> 39:37.069
Seriously, I'd rather be dead.

39:37.141 --> 39:38.631
(screams, debris clatters)

39:39.143 --> 39:41.270
GI RL (voice-over):
"A girl had a pet duck.

39:41.345 --> 39:43.540
"She fed and took care
of her pet duck.

39:43.614 --> 39:48.278
"But one day, the duck got loose
and ran away from the girl.

39:48.352 --> 39:50.912
"The duck ran down the road
and kept running...

39:50.988 --> 39:52.649
until he found a pond."

39:52.723 --> 39:56.352
Mr. President,
we've just received word...

39:56.427 --> 39:58.725
the planet is under attack by aliens.

39:58.796 --> 40:00.388
Oh. Okay.

40:00.464 --> 40:02.227
"The duck went back"-

40:02.299 --> 40:05.200
Sir? They've already wiped out
some of our cities.

40:05.269 --> 40:07.669
If nothing is done,
they'll kill us all.

40:07.738 --> 40:09.933
I see. Well, I'll handle that
in a minute.

40:10.007 --> 40:13.602
But right now, I need to find out
what's happening with the duck.

40:13.677 --> 40:17.408
Sir, with each passing moment,
more people will die.

40:17.481 --> 40:19.915
The people are gonna die
regardless...

40:19.984 --> 40:22.578
but this duck still has
a fighting chance.

40:22.653 --> 40:27.317
(sighs)
I've read the story before, Mr. President.

40:27.391 --> 40:29.416
The duck dies.

40:29.493 --> 40:30.858
(groaning)

40:30.928 --> 40:33.419
My God!
That's horrible.

40:33.497 --> 40:36.523
Mr. President, the aliens?
We're under attack.

40:36.600 --> 40:39.433
You mean, right now all of these
children's parents could be dead?

40:40.971 --> 40:43.496
- (screaming)
- Kids! Kids, please!

40:43.574 --> 40:45.940
It's not as bad as it seems.

40:46.010 --> 40:49.605
They didn't die alone. I'm sure they
died with all the other people you loved.

40:51.248 --> 40:53.546
Even Santa Claus?

40:53.617 --> 40:56.586
No, of course not.
There's no such thing as Santa Claus.

41:00.057 --> 41:02.525
Just like the Tooth Fairy,
completely made up.

41:03.427 --> 41:05.952
Easter Bunny-
Never existed.

41:07.131 --> 41:09.326
The female orgasm.

41:09.400 --> 41:12.369
Wait and see what happens
when you try to find it.

41:13.471 --> 41:16.372
What's wrong? Your parents
all getting divorces?

41:16.440 --> 41:19.637
I can give them a little advice,
if you'd like.

41:19.710 --> 41:22.543
Oh, I forgot.
They're all dead.

41:22.613 --> 41:25.878
All right now, let's go on to
another story, "Rumpelforeskin."

41:25.950 --> 41:28.646
"Stiltzkin," sir.
We have to get you to the White House.

41:28.719 --> 41:30.380
I just don't get kids.

41:30.454 --> 41:33.514
- Remind me to sign that abortion bill.
- Yes, sir.

41:40.297 --> 41:43.130
(blades squeaking)

41:46.036 --> 41:47.799
STEWARDESS: You may leave
through the forward exit doors...

41:47.872 --> 41:50.136
or the gaping hole
in the side of the plane.

41:50.207 --> 41:52.198
We realize you have
a choice in airlines...

41:52.276 --> 41:55.439
and we appreciate
you flying with Southern Coast Air.

41:55.513 --> 41:56.810
- Thank you.
- Hello?

41:58.549 --> 42:00.039
(screams)

42:00.117 --> 42:03.052
Hey! That's mine! I found it!

42:04.421 --> 42:07.185
- Cindy?
- Brenda?

42:07.258 --> 42:10.750
Oh, my God.
It's been so long.

42:10.828 --> 42:13.228
Yeah, too long.

42:13.297 --> 42:15.197
I thought you were dead.

42:15.266 --> 42:17.257
Oh, I thought
you were dead, too.

42:17.334 --> 42:19.734
What are you doing here?
Were you on this plane?

42:19.803 --> 42:21.862
No, I'm trying to get a good story.

42:21.939 --> 42:24.669
I'm a reporter now.
I work for the local news.

42:24.742 --> 42:26.334
Wow, you're really doing
well for yourself.

42:26.410 --> 42:29.937
I was on assignment.
Take a look at this.

42:30.014 --> 42:31.709
Here's Detroit.

42:31.782 --> 42:33.409
(sirens blaring, gunfire)

42:33.484 --> 42:36.009
And here's Detroit after the attack.

42:36.086 --> 42:38.680
(sirens blaring, gunfire)

42:38.756 --> 42:40.553
Oh, my God.

42:40.624 --> 42:43.286
The attack was devastating.

42:43.360 --> 42:46.056
It's over, Cindy.
Humanity has lost the war.

42:46.130 --> 42:48.121
No, no. There's still hope.

42:48.198 --> 42:50.996
I have reason to believe that there's
someone here that has the answers...

42:51.068 --> 42:54.333
maybe even a way for us to fight back.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.738
Come on.
It would make a great story.

42:57.808 --> 43:00.140
Maybe. But how are
we supposed to get there?

43:00.210 --> 43:02.144
None of these cars work.

43:02.212 --> 43:04.077
Wait. See if this works.

43:05.249 --> 43:07.012
(horn honks)

43:07.084 --> 43:10.383
Hey! I got the last working car
in New York!

43:10.454 --> 43:13.389
This is our road, bitches! Ha-ha!

43:14.391 --> 43:16.359
(shouts)

43:16.427 --> 43:18.054
(horn honking)

43:18.128 --> 43:20.824
You're right, Cindy.
That worked pretty well.

43:20.898 --> 43:22.229
L-

43:30.541 --> 43:32.168
(people moaning)

43:32.242 --> 43:34.107
CI NDY:
Look at all the injured.

43:34.178 --> 43:35.770
It's so sad.

43:37.047 --> 43:39.538
Big-ass rat, man!

43:39.617 --> 43:41.517
Oh! That sewer took forever to fix!

43:41.585 --> 43:44.281
Man, I'm gonna need
a hot bath after all of that-

43:44.355 --> 43:46.016
What the hell happened here?

43:46.090 --> 43:48.388
(moaning and wailing)

43:50.594 --> 43:53.290
- Zombies!
- Damn!

43:53.364 --> 43:54.763
(groans)

43:54.832 --> 43:56.231
Let's go!

43:56.300 --> 43:57.631
(grunts)

43:57.701 --> 43:59.362
Don't let 'em bite you!

43:59.436 --> 44:02.234
Good news!
They can still feel electricity.

44:02.306 --> 44:05.434
Grandma?
The zombies have got my grandma!

44:05.509 --> 44:08.239
Die, Grandma! Die! Die!

44:08.312 --> 44:11.975
- I loved you! I loved you!
- Mahalik?

44:12.049 --> 44:14.415
Look what they did
to my grandmama!

44:14.485 --> 44:17.886
Whoa! (screaming)

44:17.955 --> 44:19.252
(distant splash)

44:19.323 --> 44:21.257
That woman raised me from birth.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.885
(crickets chirping)

44:29.033 --> 44:31.831
MAN:
Hey, he's got a car. He's got a car.

44:31.902 --> 44:33.893
Give us the car and the keys!

44:33.971 --> 44:37.566
This isn't my car.
I would, but I can't. It's not my car.

44:37.641 --> 44:41.475
It's not my car. Don't worry, kids.
The doors are locked.

44:41.545 --> 44:43.240
There's no possible way they can-

44:43.313 --> 44:46.908
Pull the robot out of chocolate.
But that's just common sense. Oh, waiter!

44:46.984 --> 44:48.144
(clamoring)

44:48.218 --> 44:50.448
- Daddy!
- Kids!

44:50.521 --> 44:52.148
(screams)

44:55.059 --> 44:57.619
HANG-GLI DI NG MAN:
Whoa!

44:58.696 --> 45:00.960
Why?

45:01.031 --> 45:03.090
Well.

45:03.167 --> 45:06.136
Get back! Get back!

45:06.203 --> 45:08.501
(screams)

45:08.572 --> 45:10.062
(gun cocks)

45:10.140 --> 45:12.734
Gimme the gun.
I'm taking the car.

45:12.810 --> 45:14.801
What do I do about him?

45:14.878 --> 45:17.210
I don't want the car.
I just need a gun.

45:17.281 --> 45:19.545
No way I'm giving up the gun.
I want the car.

45:19.616 --> 45:23.609
So, you need a gun,
and you want a car.

45:23.687 --> 45:26.884
- What do you want?
- Well, I've never owned a knife.

45:26.957 --> 45:29.619
Okay. Let's all switch on three.

45:29.693 --> 45:32.560
One, two, three.

45:34.565 --> 45:36.533
Is this right?

45:36.600 --> 45:39.728
I don't think so.

45:41.371 --> 45:44.499
Dad, they're taking the car.

45:44.575 --> 45:48.238
Yes, well, uh, let's keep going.

45:48.312 --> 45:51.247
What?
That's it? You're giving up?

45:51.315 --> 45:53.647
Yeah, that's right. I'm giving up.

45:53.717 --> 45:56.049
You want a hero?
Go find someone else.

45:56.120 --> 45:58.520
(groans)
Why?

45:59.923 --> 46:02.551
Let's go.

46:02.626 --> 46:04.992
PRESI DENT:
Now, let me get this straight:

46:05.062 --> 46:08.964
The girl hugged the duck,
and then it dies?

46:09.032 --> 46:11.592
Mr. President,
the nation is under attack.

46:11.668 --> 46:13.363
Get me Homer Landsquiddy.

46:13.437 --> 46:15.928
You mean, "Homeland Security."

46:17.508 --> 46:20.204
Sir, this woman was an eyewitness
to one of the attacks.

46:20.277 --> 46:22.871
- What can you tell us?
- They're indestructible.

46:22.946 --> 46:25.608
The clothing was burned off
everyone's bodies.

46:25.682 --> 46:28.310
There were naked people
everywhere.

46:28.385 --> 46:30.853
- Were you naked?
- No.

46:30.921 --> 46:32.718
Thank God.
Some good news at last.

46:32.790 --> 46:34.621
Get her a souvenir.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.037
(gasps, sighs)

46:52.109 --> 46:54.577
(grunting)

46:54.645 --> 46:58.206
Lil' Kim-
Lil' Kim got my sandwich.

46:59.683 --> 47:02.447
Look out-
Russell Crowe's got a phone!

47:02.519 --> 47:05.079
R. Kelly, don't pee on me!

47:06.190 --> 47:08.249
My lovely lady lumps!

47:08.325 --> 47:10.316
Where are we?

47:10.394 --> 47:13.591
I'm not sure,
but I think we're close.

47:13.664 --> 47:17.122
It's supposed to be near mile 62.

47:17.201 --> 47:18.930
Is something wrong?

47:19.002 --> 47:21.300
No, it's just...

47:21.371 --> 47:24.807
I met this guy,
and I wonder if he's safe.

47:24.875 --> 47:26.809
Oh, you'd love him, Brenda.

47:26.877 --> 47:29.937
What's his name?
I might've already loved him.

47:30.013 --> 47:31.776
Tom Ryan.

47:31.849 --> 47:34.977
Yeah, did him.
Big, fat Chinese guy?

47:35.052 --> 47:38.146
No... No.

47:38.222 --> 47:41.589
But he is the kind of guy that I'd like
to share the rest of my life with.

47:41.658 --> 47:43.592
- (shrieks)
- (screams)

47:44.862 --> 47:46.659
(gasping)

47:46.730 --> 47:48.755
Cindy! Look!

47:56.773 --> 47:58.468
What is this place?

47:58.542 --> 48:01.272
I don't know, but the boy's father's
somewhere in there.

48:01.345 --> 48:03.279
We'll have to sneak our way in.

48:03.347 --> 48:05.338
But we're not gonna
blend in dressed like this.

48:05.415 --> 48:08.350
- Brenda, look.
- He's a wonderful boy.

48:10.621 --> 48:12.748
(yelping)

48:12.823 --> 48:15.951
(punching, grunting)

48:19.930 --> 48:22.831
(groaning)

48:36.680 --> 48:38.910
- (door creaking)
- WOMAN: Ezekiel?

48:38.982 --> 48:40.916
Ezekiel, where are you?

48:43.086 --> 48:45.247
(goofy laughter)

48:46.490 --> 48:50.756
Ezekiel,
shall we have a foot race?

48:50.827 --> 48:52.761
No cheating.

48:53.830 --> 48:56.128
(laughing, grunts)

49:01.471 --> 49:03.530
(indistinct conversations)

49:15.652 --> 49:17.210
That's him!

49:17.287 --> 49:19.585
- He's cute.
- (horn blows)

49:22.592 --> 49:27.427
Friends, friends. Do not fear the noise
of those of whom we do not speak.

49:27.497 --> 49:29.692
There is a gentle truce
between our village

49:29.766 --> 49:32.291
and the creatures
beyond their borders.

49:32.369 --> 49:34.234
Now, who would like to say grace?

49:34.304 --> 49:36.204
Ooh!

49:36.273 --> 49:38.104
Ah, Ezekiel.

49:39.409 --> 49:41.400
Pee-pee.
(chuckling)

49:41.478 --> 49:44.413
Pee-pee vagina.

49:46.650 --> 49:48.743
ALL:
Amen.

49:50.287 --> 49:52.585
(gasping)

49:56.893 --> 49:59.123
- (grunts)
- Father?

49:59.196 --> 50:01.858
Holly.

50:01.932 --> 50:04.264
For what purpose
do you interrupt

50:04.334 --> 50:08.737
the celebration
of the domestic partnership

50:08.805 --> 50:11.103
of Mordecai and Hoss?

50:11.174 --> 50:13.108
The guards caught
two outsiders near the cabin.

50:19.816 --> 50:21.249
Who are you?

50:21.318 --> 50:24.378
I must speak with you.
I was sent by your son.

50:24.454 --> 50:26.513
Don't be ridiculous.

50:26.590 --> 50:28.854
- I have no son.
- That's not true!

50:28.925 --> 50:31.223
I know who you are.
I've seen the pictures.

50:31.294 --> 50:34.422
- I was young. I needed the work.
- No.

50:34.498 --> 50:36.090
At Mrs. Norris's house.

50:36.166 --> 50:38.566
I didn't know whose house it was.

50:38.635 --> 50:41.069
They drugged me.
Never mind that.

50:41.138 --> 50:45.268
You're outsiders.
The council will decide your fates.

50:47.310 --> 50:49.403
(gavel banging)

50:51.381 --> 50:54.908
The question of the outsiders
is now at hand.

50:54.985 --> 50:58.580
But first, Martha,
have you some tidings?

50:58.655 --> 51:01.021
Nathaniel Winston
and Alice Smith

51:01.091 --> 51:03.059
have informed me
of their intentions.

51:03.126 --> 51:06.323
He intends to have sex with her
as soon as possible.

51:06.396 --> 51:10.457
She intends to put up a mild fight
and then give in.

51:10.534 --> 51:12.001
(villagers murmuring)

51:16.973 --> 51:19.999
Amos, something does trouble you?

51:21.044 --> 51:25.447
We now have a majority
of those who wish to say "I'm"...

51:25.515 --> 51:27.847
instead of"I am."

51:27.918 --> 51:30.250
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

51:31.388 --> 51:33.686
- (gavel rapping)
- Silence!

51:33.757 --> 51:35.622
We have more important matters
to discuss.

51:35.692 --> 51:39.150
I fear that the presence
of the outsiders

51:39.229 --> 51:42.687
will attract those of whom
we do not speak.

51:42.766 --> 51:45.963
If you talk about those
of whom we do not speak...

51:46.036 --> 51:48.334
have you not spoken of that

51:48.405 --> 51:50.202
about which we do not talk?

51:50.273 --> 51:53.208
Do not speak of that
of about which

51:53.276 --> 51:58.077
we talk of not speaking...
about.

52:07.390 --> 52:11.053
Elder Hale. We should welcome
the outsiders among us.

52:11.128 --> 52:14.586
Jeremiah, ought not
your tongue be held?

52:14.664 --> 52:17.394
I am sorry, Elder Hale...

52:17.467 --> 52:21.665
but sometimes my tongue wiggles
beyond my ability to control it.

52:21.738 --> 52:23.501
(gasping)

52:23.573 --> 52:27.373
This is a problem with which
I have had much experience.

52:27.444 --> 52:30.538
Maybe I could help him in a room
in which there are no others.

52:31.915 --> 52:34.145
Or you can all watch.
I don't give a shit.

52:34.217 --> 52:37.050
- (gasping)
- Silence.

52:38.522 --> 52:40.683
(breathing heavily)

52:40.757 --> 52:45.217
After this, how about you take
your thing of which we do not speak...

52:45.295 --> 52:47.490
and slide it up in my place
of which I like-

52:47.564 --> 52:49.498
Silence!

52:49.566 --> 52:51.898
The elders will consult.

53:00.443 --> 53:02.104
Ah. Much better.

53:11.988 --> 53:14.786
(loudly passing gas)

53:14.858 --> 53:16.951
(farting, gurgling)

53:22.732 --> 53:25.963
(splashing, farting)

53:30.073 --> 53:32.473
(clears throat)

53:32.542 --> 53:35.204
(farting)

53:35.312 --> 53:39.248
I'm not in my house, am I?

53:39.316 --> 53:41.216
No.

53:41.284 --> 53:43.377
(farts)

53:44.387 --> 53:49.120
Outsiders, we have decided
to let you stay with us...

53:49.192 --> 53:52.491
so that you'll be safe from
those from of whom we do not-

53:52.562 --> 53:54.689
Or don't.

53:54.764 --> 53:56.254
Speak.

53:56.333 --> 53:59.359
But now that you are
a part of our village...

53:59.436 --> 54:01.495
understand this:

54:01.571 --> 54:03.698
You may never leave.

54:03.773 --> 54:07.004
No! No!

54:07.077 --> 54:09.602
How did your son die?

54:09.679 --> 54:12.204
- The fate of the world is at stake.
- You know what to do.

54:12.282 --> 54:13.943
Was it you? Did you kill him?

54:14.017 --> 54:15.951
This is some shit
up with which we will not put.

54:16.019 --> 54:18.510
- I'm for that.
- I am against it.

54:19.856 --> 54:21.790
(moaning, slurping)

54:21.858 --> 54:25.123
This village isn't
what it used to be.

54:27.530 --> 54:30.897
Just hours after
the devastating alien attack...

54:30.967 --> 54:34.266
world leaders have gathered
at the United Nations.

54:34.337 --> 54:37.033
In this, mankind's darkest hour...

54:37.107 --> 54:39.439
the human race has turned, as one...

54:39.509 --> 54:41.443
to the wisdom and leadership

54:41.511 --> 54:44.036
of the President
of the United States.

54:44.114 --> 54:48.050
Ladies and gentlemen,
the President of the United States.

54:48.118 --> 54:50.086
Go get 'em, tiger.

54:50.153 --> 54:52.144
They mean you, sir.

54:52.222 --> 54:54.019
Oh, yes, of course.

54:58.862 --> 55:00.454
(clears throat)

55:03.033 --> 55:07.231
So... an Indian, a Frenchman
and the Pope are all on a plane.

55:07.304 --> 55:11.206
The pilot says,
"Hey, are any of you not circumcised?"

55:11.274 --> 55:14.209
So the Pope lifts up
his robe and says...

55:14.277 --> 55:16.973
"Shut up, stupid.
You don't even speak English."

55:17.047 --> 55:18.514
(laughing)

55:18.581 --> 55:20.913
The Israeli asked theJapanese guy
to open his eyes...

55:20.984 --> 55:23.418
but theJapanese man says,
"I'm not squinting, you crazyJew.

55:23.486 --> 55:26.853
You're the one who sold me
these cheap glasses."

55:26.923 --> 55:29.585
What's the difference between
a Belgian and a lump of dog shit?

55:29.659 --> 55:33.220
The Belgian drinks wine,
but the dog shit smells good.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.561
(President laughing)

55:37.634 --> 55:41.536
But, on a serious note,
I'm here today at the, uh...

55:42.305 --> 55:45.103
"un"...because the Earth
has been attacked.

55:45.175 --> 55:48.042
I'm happy to report that we may
have found a way to fight back.

55:48.111 --> 55:50.602
My military advisers
at the Pentagram

55:50.680 --> 55:52.443
have managed
to do the impossible.

55:52.515 --> 55:56.178
They have captured one
of the alien heat ray guns.

55:56.252 --> 56:00.518
As you know, the heat ray destroys the body,
leaving behind nothing but clothes.

56:00.590 --> 56:03.753
Our engineers have managed to reverse
the polarity of the weapon

56:03.827 --> 56:07.126
in the hopes that it can now
be turned against

56:07.197 --> 56:09.256
the alien invaders.

56:13.536 --> 56:16.562
- (gasping)
- Well, where was I?

56:16.639 --> 56:19.802
Ah, yes. We expect that the
alien shields will be vulnerable

56:19.876 --> 56:22.367
to this reconfigured weapon.

56:22.445 --> 56:24.276
(clamoring)

56:24.347 --> 56:27.714
- People, please! Please!
- (shocked gasping)

56:27.784 --> 56:33.120
Please, people. Now, I know that this
new technology may seem frightening...

56:33.189 --> 56:36.625
but I believe that deep down
inside this heat cannon

56:36.693 --> 56:38.126
is our best chance.

56:38.194 --> 56:40.628
Let me give you a demonstration.

56:40.697 --> 56:43.393
Now let's see if this thing
is plugged in.

56:43.466 --> 56:45.900
(groaning)

56:45.969 --> 56:48.130
Uh... it's not a very pretty sight.

56:48.204 --> 56:50.468
Everything's loose
and flapping around.

56:50.540 --> 56:52.508
Look at this little pink thing.

56:53.610 --> 56:55.544
(retching)

56:56.713 --> 56:59.477
(grunting)

56:59.549 --> 57:02.609
Someone get some lubricant,
and we'll slather it around in here.

57:02.685 --> 57:05.017
There.

57:05.088 --> 57:07.921
(screaming)

57:09.058 --> 57:11.117
(shrieking)

57:17.700 --> 57:20.863
Harper. Good God,
these people are all naked.

57:20.937 --> 57:24.304
Have you no shame?
Have you no decency?

57:24.374 --> 57:26.638
- Sir, you're naked, too.
- I am?

57:26.709 --> 57:29.371
- I thought this was a wrinkly leather coat.
- Sir!

57:29.446 --> 57:31.038
- These aren't buttons?
- No!

57:31.114 --> 57:33.446
I've been pulling this thing
up and down like a zipper.

57:33.516 --> 57:35.177
Mr. President, please.

57:35.251 --> 57:37.685
- (farts)
- There goes that duck again.

57:43.760 --> 57:45.694
Yo, man, you see this red weed?

57:45.762 --> 57:47.753
(coughs)
Nope.

57:47.831 --> 57:49.765
Dad, how much further till Mom's?

57:49.833 --> 57:51.664
I don't know.

57:51.734 --> 57:54.328
I'm not sure how much longer
I can carry your sister.

57:54.404 --> 57:57.703
I've been walking
this entire time.

57:57.774 --> 58:00.368
- Then who the hell is-
- I'll pay you.

58:00.443 --> 58:03.037
- (gasps)
- Stay close, Rachel.

58:03.112 --> 58:06.548
- Dad, look!
- (screaming)

58:06.616 --> 58:09.414
Hey! Hey! You guys!
I want to help!

58:09.486 --> 58:11.420
Robbie! Oh, no.

58:13.056 --> 58:16.423
Don't move. For God's sake,
stay right there. I'll be right back!

58:16.493 --> 58:19.485
Hey! Hey, you guys!
I want to help.

58:19.562 --> 58:21.826
(screams)

58:21.898 --> 58:23.661
Awesome!

58:23.733 --> 58:26.327
- Wait!
- Are you crazy?

58:26.402 --> 58:28.529
No!
They'll pay for half my college.

58:28.605 --> 58:29.867
(screaming)

58:29.939 --> 58:31.804
Kick ass.

58:31.875 --> 58:33.706
Robbie!

58:33.776 --> 58:35.710
- Yes!
- What's the matter with you?

58:35.778 --> 58:39.043
Hey, look at that guy.
This is so cool!

58:41.117 --> 58:44.848
Robbie! Robbie!

58:50.326 --> 58:52.851
Rachel! Rachel!

58:52.929 --> 58:55.227
Little girl, are you alone?

58:55.298 --> 58:57.357
You need to come with me.

58:57.433 --> 58:59.424
I'll keep you safe, right, kids?

58:59.502 --> 59:00.935
KI DS:
Uh-uh.

59:01.004 --> 59:03.063
- Do you have a little brother?
- Get away from her!

59:03.139 --> 59:06.472
(deep, booming trumpeting)

59:06.543 --> 59:08.204
Run away, kids!

59:09.045 --> 59:10.740
Toward the tripod,
if you have to!

59:10.813 --> 59:13.145
Don't go! I've got a Ferris wheel
and a chimp...

59:13.216 --> 59:15.650
and a big, soft bed
we can all get in.

59:15.718 --> 59:20.121
(panting)

59:20.189 --> 59:22.589
No, please!

59:22.659 --> 59:23.956
Not my real face!

59:24.027 --> 59:25.892
Not my real face!

59:25.962 --> 59:27.987
No!

59:30.833 --> 59:33.563
(rapid gunfire, explosions)

59:33.636 --> 59:35.228
Over here.

59:35.305 --> 59:38.399
Follow me to safety.

59:38.474 --> 59:41.602
- Ow!
- Follow me to safety.

59:41.678 --> 59:44.613
- I don't know about this.
- I'm an excellent judge of character.

59:44.681 --> 59:47.172
All right. Yeah.

59:54.424 --> 59:56.915
(owl hooting)

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.271
(man, woman breathing heavily)

01:00:12.342 --> 01:00:15.277
MAN:
That's it.

01:00:15.345 --> 01:00:16.573
Oh, Brenda.

01:00:16.646 --> 01:00:21.015
Yes! You did it!
(laughs)

01:00:21.084 --> 01:00:24.781
You have learned quickly
and produced splendid butter.

01:00:24.854 --> 01:00:27.322
Are you sure you have not
churned before?

01:00:27.390 --> 01:00:29.881
Well, we don't call it churning
where I come from.

01:00:29.959 --> 01:00:31.586
(bell tolling)

01:00:33.830 --> 01:00:35.195
(man shouting)

01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:39.397
Pee-pee vagina.

01:00:39.469 --> 01:00:40.959
(grunts)

01:00:46.309 --> 01:00:48.709
(creaking sound)

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:51.611
(chuckles, grunting)

01:00:53.583 --> 01:00:55.517
Quick! Into the cellar.

01:00:55.585 --> 01:00:58.110
No!

01:00:58.187 --> 01:01:01.213
This is the cellar.
That's the cesspool.

01:01:01.290 --> 01:01:02.882
Damn it!

01:01:05.428 --> 01:01:06.759
Quick!

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:23.043
(sneezes)

01:01:25.948 --> 01:01:27.575
(gasps)

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.118
BOTH:
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

01:01:30.186 --> 01:01:32.347
Boogedy-boogedy-boogedy-boogedy.

01:01:32.422 --> 01:01:35.255
Hey! You're not monsters.

01:01:37.527 --> 01:01:39.085
Old Lady Henderson?

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:41.562
And Pig-FaceJoe!

01:01:41.631 --> 01:01:43.690
(woman screaming)

01:01:46.769 --> 01:01:48.634
What happened?

01:01:48.705 --> 01:01:50.195
It is Henry.

01:01:50.273 --> 01:01:52.833
He has suffered a heart attack

01:01:52.909 --> 01:01:54.900
brought on by this knife.

01:01:56.345 --> 01:01:58.245
Who did this?

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.248
It was... Ezekiel.

01:02:02.085 --> 01:02:04.076
Henry, you need a hospital.

01:02:04.153 --> 01:02:06.644
It's not too late.
We can help you.

01:02:06.723 --> 01:02:09.851
Perhaps you could start by
not leaning on the knife.

01:02:09.926 --> 01:02:12.588
(gasps)

01:02:12.962 --> 01:02:14.623
Do not be concerned for him,
Cindy.

01:02:14.697 --> 01:02:18.155
We have sent our most qualified
villager for medicines.

01:02:31.247 --> 01:02:33.238
I am so dead.

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:35.910
Please, leave me alone
with Cindy and Brenda.

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:37.577
I have much to tell them.

01:02:40.923 --> 01:02:43.016
Listen carefully to me.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:45.083
I am not long for this world.

01:02:45.161 --> 01:02:47.129
- Pussy.
- Brenda!

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:50.996
What? 50 Cent got shot nine times.
He's still walking around.

01:02:51.067 --> 01:02:54.127
Tell me, Henry, who killed the boy?
Was it you?

01:02:54.203 --> 01:02:58.037
No, I loved him and his mother
very much.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:03:00.098
I should have been with him
when he died.

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:02.440
It was horrible.

01:03:02.512 --> 01:03:04.537
What happened?
You must tell me.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.775
They went to a boxing match.

01:03:06.849 --> 01:03:09.283
It was a women's
championship title fight.

01:03:10.753 --> 01:03:13.586
And there was
a terrible accident.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.817
Oh, my God.

01:03:23.733 --> 01:03:26.634
(yelling)

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.636
Only in America!

01:03:28.704 --> 01:03:31.070
(bones cracking)

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:36.038
All this time, I've been
searching for his killer

01:03:36.112 --> 01:03:38.080
when it was me, Brenda.

01:03:38.147 --> 01:03:40.081
It was all my fault.

01:03:40.149 --> 01:03:42.879
Henry, your son told me
that if I found his killer...

01:03:42.952 --> 01:03:44.920
I would know how
to defeat the aliens.

01:03:44.987 --> 01:03:47.922
And he was right.
Don't you see?

01:03:47.990 --> 01:03:51.118
All you have to do is-
(screams)

01:03:51.194 --> 01:03:52.855
(chuckling)

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:56.523
Who the hell
let his ass out of jail?

01:03:56.599 --> 01:03:58.362
His brother, the sheriff.

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:01.665
(goofy laughter)

01:04:01.737 --> 01:04:04.706
Fuckin' "A."

01:04:04.941 --> 01:04:07.205
(gunfire, explosions in distance)

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:11.842
(softly)
There you go, sweetie.

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:13.848
We're gonna die, aren't we?

01:04:13.916 --> 01:04:18.046
Hey, nothing's gonna happen to you.
I haven't lost anyone yet.

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:21.578
- You've lost Robbie.
- Except Robbie.

01:04:21.657 --> 01:04:26.060
None of that matters right now.
What's important is that I'm here with you.

01:04:26.128 --> 01:04:28.062
Try and get some sleep, okay?

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:31.391
Sing me
"Lullaby and Good Night"?

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.535
I don't know that one.

01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:38.130
Sing me "Hushabye Mountain"?

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:40.266
I'm sorry, Rachel,
I don't that one, either.

01:04:45.248 --> 01:04:46.579
(sighs)

01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.988
(off-key)
#You want this money #

01:04:53.055 --> 01:04:55.489
#Then you gotta be a bad bitch #

01:04:57.159 --> 01:05:00.720
# Shake that ass for a tip
if you a bad bitch #

01:05:00.796 --> 01:05:04.254
# Drop down to the floor
if you a bad bitch #

01:05:04.333 --> 01:05:06.995
# Oh, no, she ain't no ho #

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:09.435
# She a bad... bitch #

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.905
(loud snoring)

01:05:17.013 --> 01:05:19.447
Hey. Come on in.

01:05:19.515 --> 01:05:22.109
Have a seat.

01:05:22.184 --> 01:05:25.176
- The name's Oliver.
- Tom Ryan.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:29.887
I found this place.
Plenty of food-

01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:33.727
Along with two freshly killed
busybodies upstairs...

01:05:33.796 --> 01:05:36.993
who "owned" the place.
We could stay here forever.

01:05:37.066 --> 01:05:39.830
- Are you afraid?
- Of course I'm afraid.

01:05:39.902 --> 01:05:42.063
I'm not.
I've been around death plenty.

01:05:42.138 --> 01:05:44.629
I used to drive an ambulance
in the city...

01:05:44.707 --> 01:05:48.302
but, apparently, I wasn't
a very strong driver.

01:05:48.377 --> 01:05:50.709
It seems I was killing more people
than I was saving.

01:05:50.780 --> 01:05:53.476
Something about that siren
got me excited.

01:05:53.549 --> 01:05:57.110
Wham! Carnage.

01:05:57.186 --> 01:05:59.620
But this is different.
This is a war.

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.987
No, it's an extermination.

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:04.822
It's no more of a war than there's a war
between men and maggots...

01:06:04.894 --> 01:06:07.226
or dragons and wolves...

01:06:07.296 --> 01:06:11.426
or men riding dragons,
throwing wolves at maggots.

01:06:11.500 --> 01:06:15.197
Damn it, Tom. Can't you understand
what I'm trying to tell you?

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:17.762
These aliens must have a weakness.

01:06:17.840 --> 01:06:20.240
I heard that theJaps killed
a few of'em over in Kikkoman.

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:23.142
Kikkoman.
That's-That's soy sauce.

01:06:23.212 --> 01:06:24.975
Right, yeah. Low sodium.

01:06:25.047 --> 01:06:28.210
What I'm trying to say, Tom, is that you
and I should be fighting these things.

01:06:28.284 --> 01:06:30.684
It's us that should be coming up
from under the ground.

01:06:30.753 --> 01:06:32.812
Of course, we'll have to
bury ourselves first...

01:06:32.888 --> 01:06:34.219
but it'll be worth it.

01:06:34.290 --> 01:06:36.417
Cool breeze. No sunblock. Worms.

01:06:36.492 --> 01:06:39.484
When we build our own tripods,
they'll have four legs.

01:06:39.562 --> 01:06:41.530
I gotta show ya something.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:47.892
We'll tunnel up from behind
and scare the piss out of'em.

01:06:52.908 --> 01:06:55.399
Wish we had some shovels,
don't you?

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:57.969
(whirring)

01:06:59.815 --> 01:07:01.248
(electronic tones)

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:06.817
(whispers)
Dad.

01:07:33.482 --> 01:07:35.780
(laughing)

01:07:36.552 --> 01:07:37.951
(contented sigh)

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.390
(screams)
Daddy!

01:08:15.458 --> 01:08:17.085
Rachel!

01:08:17.158 --> 01:08:19.559
(Rachel screaming)

01:08:19.627 --> 01:08:23.462
Rachel! Rachel!

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:27.296
(screaming)

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.462
(owl hooting)

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:35.743
What's the secret, Brenda?
What am I missing?

01:08:35.810 --> 01:08:37.870
(bell clanging)

01:08:37.947 --> 01:08:40.916
Oh, please!
More fake monsters?

01:08:43.586 --> 01:08:46.612
(deep trumpeting)

01:08:48.823 --> 01:08:52.453
- Cindy!
- (screaming)

01:08:53.929 --> 01:08:57.194
(people screaming)

01:08:57.265 --> 01:08:59.928
(man yelling)

01:09:03.906 --> 01:09:05.430
(screaming)

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:08.170
(gasping)

01:09:08.243 --> 01:09:11.441
(muffled)
Help! Help!

01:09:12.814 --> 01:09:15.807
- I promised I'd find you, didn't I?
- (gasps)

01:09:29.598 --> 01:09:32.395
Where are we?
What is this?

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:35.528
Some kind of basket
attached to the tripod.

01:09:35.604 --> 01:09:37.265
Jesus!

01:09:37.339 --> 01:09:40.240
I know, it's horrible.
But why?

01:09:40.309 --> 01:09:42.140
What are the aliens
gonna do to us?

01:09:42.211 --> 01:09:44.145
I don't know,
but they're taking everyone-

01:09:44.212 --> 01:09:46.908
young, old, rich, poor, Chingy.

01:09:46.982 --> 01:09:49.974
# Let's ride,
then I drop the top #

01:09:50.051 --> 01:09:53.078
(gasping)

01:09:58.093 --> 01:10:00.186
- Daddy!
- Rachel!

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:03.663
- No!
- Daddy! Help!

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.632
Tom!

01:10:07.736 --> 01:10:10.102
(screaming)

01:10:15.477 --> 01:10:18.139
(pants)
Am I dead?

01:10:18.214 --> 01:10:20.307
BRENDA:
You're not dead.

01:10:23.485 --> 01:10:26.215
(gasping)

01:10:26.288 --> 01:10:29.951
(gasping)

01:10:30.025 --> 01:10:32.459
- Brenda!
- Cindy!

01:10:32.528 --> 01:10:35.326
Hey... could be worse.

01:10:38.133 --> 01:10:41.398
- You want to switch?
- Okay.

01:10:41.470 --> 01:10:44.371
Brenda, look!

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:48.035
BRENDA: I don't believe it!
The aliens killed a dinosaur!

01:10:48.110 --> 01:10:49.975
(footsteps thundering)

01:10:52.214 --> 01:10:56.310
DISTORTED MALE VOICE: Hello, humans.
Welcome to the inside of the command tripod.

01:10:57.119 --> 01:10:59.587
Where's Rachel? What have
you done with my daughter?

01:10:59.655 --> 01:11:03.523
All in good time, Tom.
But first, I want to play a game.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:07.392
The devices you wear
will trigger in 60 seconds.

01:11:07.463 --> 01:11:11.923
The switch on the wall
behind Cindy will disable them.

01:11:12.001 --> 01:11:13.866
But where is the key?

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.528
I'll give you a hint, Cindy.

01:11:16.972 --> 01:11:18.701
Let the game begin.

01:11:18.774 --> 01:11:22.505
I... I don't get it.

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:27.208
Okay...
maybe this will help you "see."

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:37.751
You want me to... cut something?

01:11:37.826 --> 01:11:41.091
That should be obvious, yes.

01:11:43.132 --> 01:11:44.599
No.

01:11:46.735 --> 01:11:49.761
No! (growls)
The key is behind your eye, okay?

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:52.830
(Cindy gasps)

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:59.111
Zoltar, get in here!
This one's gonna do it!

01:12:00.516 --> 01:12:03.076
(squishing, then pop)

01:12:03.152 --> 01:12:05.416
Fake eye.

01:12:05.487 --> 01:12:07.819
Bad bar fight in '96.

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.551
(all gasp)

01:12:11.627 --> 01:12:14.061
- Oh.
- (squishing)

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:16.154
(panting)

01:12:16.231 --> 01:12:20.167
Oh... oh, I hope this doesn't
come between us.

01:12:20.235 --> 01:12:22.226
Of course not.

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:27.333
- (squishy squeak)
- (sighs)

01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:31.639
Is it too late
for me to try this on?

01:12:31.714 --> 01:12:33.579
Silence!
The game is not yet over.

01:12:33.649 --> 01:12:36.015
(whirring, clanking)

01:12:36.085 --> 01:12:37.746
- Rachel!
- Daddy!

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:40.254
- Robbie!
- RACHEL: Daddy!

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:48.425
The only thing keeping
your children alive, Tom, is you.

01:12:48.497 --> 01:12:50.988
Well, we had a good run.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:53.697
(both screaming)

01:12:54.670 --> 01:12:57.332
Ha! You weren't expecting that,
were you?

01:12:57.406 --> 01:13:00.341
On the contrary,
I was counting on it.

01:13:06.115 --> 01:13:08.811
I call it..."the nutcracker."

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.818
Why?

01:13:10.886 --> 01:13:13.616
(grunts)
(strained) Of course.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:24.459
Tempura. Sushi. Sashimi!

01:13:26.268 --> 01:13:28.327
(sloshing)

01:13:28.404 --> 01:13:30.668
Oh, my- Oh, my gosh.

01:13:30.739 --> 01:13:34.334
Of course. Follow the blood.
Henry was his stepdad.

01:13:34.410 --> 01:13:36.901
You're the little boy's real father!

01:13:36.979 --> 01:13:38.879
Where did you even meet her?

01:13:38.947 --> 01:13:41.415
ALI EN:
It was spring break in Cabo. So what?

01:13:41.483 --> 01:13:43.815
I blended in.
Seriously, who gives a crap?

01:13:43.886 --> 01:13:45.217
What's this?

01:13:47.723 --> 01:13:49.657
Enjoy your purple nurple, Tom.

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:51.522
(groaning)

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:55.021
Please, your son
wouldn't want this.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.895
His soul walks the Earth because
of the pain you've caused him.

01:13:57.966 --> 01:14:00.594
No. I have crossed a galaxy
for revenge.

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.864
But it's my fault.
Let the others go.

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:06.101
Oh, I don't think so.
Look upon him as he writhes!

01:14:06.175 --> 01:14:09.576
Hey, Cindy!
Look, I'm on TV, y'all! Check it out!

01:14:09.645 --> 01:14:11.738
I'm gonna give a shout out
to all my peeps!

01:14:11.814 --> 01:14:14.112
(gasps)

01:14:14.183 --> 01:14:15.878
BRENDA:
Have you lost your mind?

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:18.385
No one... bitch slaps... Brenda!

01:14:18.454 --> 01:14:20.615
Zoltar, help!

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:24.125
Oh, oh!
This is some bullshit!

01:14:24.193 --> 01:14:27.560
I know you hold a grudge against humanity
for your son's death, but-

01:14:27.629 --> 01:14:29.961
Oh, wet willy!

01:14:30.032 --> 01:14:33.263
(gasps) Killing us won't bring
your little boy back.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:36.236
No. You will all pay
for what you have done.

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:38.398
Besides,
I've already built this thing.

01:14:39.842 --> 01:14:42.902
When the trap closes on you,
it will lock the chain in place.

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.969
Your children will be saved...

01:14:45.047 --> 01:14:47.641
but you will suffer a terrible death.

01:14:47.716 --> 01:14:50.378
Can you hang on
to the ones you love?

01:14:50.452 --> 01:14:52.579
You have 60 seconds.

01:14:52.654 --> 01:14:54.087
(metal creaking)

01:14:54.156 --> 01:14:57.819
- No.
- Don't worry, kids. I won't quit on you.

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:01.295
It's okay to let go, Dad.

01:15:01.363 --> 01:15:03.923
All you ever had to do
was show that you loved me.

01:15:05.200 --> 01:15:07.464
And show me what it means
to be a man.

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:10.061
And show me
that I could love again.

01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:12.969
We forgive you, Dad.

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:16.101
(metal creaking, chains clanking)

01:15:16.178 --> 01:15:17.668
(gasps)

01:15:21.750 --> 01:15:24.116
(metallic creaking)

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.154
The spikes- they stopped!

01:15:29.825 --> 01:15:32.191
- Kids!
- Daddy!

01:15:36.532 --> 01:15:39.501
Are you... sparing our lives?

01:15:39.568 --> 01:15:41.502
Anyone can hold a grudge...

01:15:41.570 --> 01:15:43.868
but it takes real courage to forgive.

01:15:43.939 --> 01:15:47.875
- The invasion is over.
- And?

01:15:47.943 --> 01:15:51.003
And I guess I'm sorry or something.
I don't know.

01:15:51.079 --> 01:15:52.706
Like you mean it.

01:15:52.781 --> 01:15:54.715
(sighing)
Okay.

01:15:54.783 --> 01:15:57.377
I'm sorry for killing millions of people.
Whatever!

01:15:57.452 --> 01:16:00.114
Wait... where's Brenda?

01:16:02.724 --> 01:16:04.351
BRENDA:
What?

01:16:04.426 --> 01:16:06.826
We're at peace now.
I was just sealing the deal.

01:16:08.096 --> 01:16:11.429
Come on, Brenda. Let's go.

01:16:11.500 --> 01:16:15.402
Bye, Zoltar!
Don't lose my number!

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:19.497
Tell me you didn't catch something.

01:16:19.575 --> 01:16:22.476
Nah, it's cool.
She said she was a virgin.

01:16:24.680 --> 01:16:27.046
We are so fucked.

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:29.709
(engines powering down)

01:16:42.264 --> 01:16:44.198
Mommy!

01:16:49.071 --> 01:16:50.368
Thank you.

01:16:52.774 --> 01:16:54.503
Hey, look, kids- Grandpa.

01:16:56.478 --> 01:16:58.207
No, that's my new husband.

01:17:02.351 --> 01:17:04.911
(passionate moaning)

01:17:04.987 --> 01:17:09.617
Oh, I think it's romantic-
the way love can find anyone.

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:16.986
JAMES EARLJONES (voice-over):
And so, love triumphed in the end...

01:17:17.065 --> 01:17:19.363
and the invaders were destroyed.

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:22.164
For this world, our world...

01:17:22.237 --> 01:17:24.205
- is the world of man.
- (crying)

01:17:24.272 --> 01:17:27.298
We have earned the right
to live here...

01:17:27.376 --> 01:17:31.745
and as long as we love,
humanity will prevail.

01:17:31.813 --> 01:17:35.647
Each of our enemies has failed
in their quest to defeat us...

01:17:35.717 --> 01:17:40.450
each has been undone
by their own nefarious plans.

01:17:40.522 --> 01:17:43.980
Among all worlds,
across all galaxies...

01:17:44.059 --> 01:17:47.722
we stand above, we stand alone.

01:17:47.796 --> 01:17:52.426
None can threaten our existence,
none can challenge our spirit.

01:17:52.501 --> 01:17:54.435
And why?

01:17:54.503 --> 01:17:57.802
Of all the qualities
that make us unique...

01:17:57.873 --> 01:18:00.535
it is love that is
our greatest strength...

01:18:00.609 --> 01:18:03.237
and because of love, mankind-

01:18:04.946 --> 01:18:07.210
(cheering and applause)

01:18:07.282 --> 01:18:10.513
Thank you.
Hello, and welcome to the show.

01:18:46.154 --> 01:18:49.146
(laughing)

01:18:50.292 --> 01:18:53.659
- So, you're in love.
- I am. I'm in love.

01:18:53.729 --> 01:18:56.698
(laughing)

01:18:56.765 --> 01:18:58.733
(audience laughing)

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.200
He's lost it.
The boy's lost it.

01:19:01.269 --> 01:19:03.897
Yeah!
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:19:03.972 --> 01:19:06.998
(screeches)

01:19:07.075 --> 01:19:09.475
(whoops, laughs)

01:19:09.544 --> 01:19:12.138
- You are adorable when you are in love.
- Thank you.

01:19:12.214 --> 01:19:15.513
- Tell us all about her.
- She's great. She's really terrific.

01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.245
So it's complicated.

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:19.583
Yeah, you were saying
that-that she's complex, I guess.

01:19:19.654 --> 01:19:21.485
Shut up!

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:27.261
(crowd cheering)

01:19:30.098 --> 01:19:33.363
- Ow!
- You're insane. Tom Ryan is insane!

01:19:33.435 --> 01:19:35.460
- I'm insane!
- Are you happy?

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:37.505
- You're happy?
- I'm so happy. Hey! Look!

01:19:37.572 --> 01:19:42.305
Whoa!
(blubbering)

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:44.368
Tom. Okay, you've got balls.

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:50.509

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:56.185

(snarling)

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.447
Okay, um, Tom...

01:20:23.518 --> 01:20:26.282
I know she's here.
Cindy, I know you're in the building.

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:28.686
- (muffled) Cindy! Cindy!
- (audience chanting) Cindy! Cindy!

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:33.751
