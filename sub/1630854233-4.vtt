00:01.523 --> 00:04.134
<i>Previously on
"Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:04.221 --> 00:05.918
What is it that you want, Maurice,

00:06.006 --> 00:07.616
out there in the world?

00:07.703 --> 00:10.706
<i>Don't be a stranger,
young solider.</i>

00:10.793 --> 00:12.838
I remember
we were gonna break them.

00:12.925 --> 00:14.579
Who you breaking now?

00:14.666 --> 00:15.580
Wait and see.

00:15.667 --> 00:17.017
<i>What happened to Angela?</i>

00:17.104 --> 00:18.496
<i>I don't wanna talk about Angela.</i>

00:18.583 --> 00:20.107
You will take part

00:20.194 --> 00:22.718
in the Vampiric Ability
and Potential Assessment,

00:22.805 --> 00:25.199
henceforth known as
The Assessment.

00:25.286 --> 00:28.332
We can't let just anyone
join our ranks.

00:28.419 --> 00:31.074
I'm not the only one
who dies if I fail.

00:31.161 --> 00:32.597
My sire dies too.

00:32.684 --> 00:34.121
Look, we're in this together.

00:34.208 --> 00:35.948
I believe in you.

00:36.036 --> 00:39.213
<i>Reginald Andres
has a unique gift.</i>

00:39.300 --> 00:41.954
Reginald can Glamour
other vampires.

00:42.042 --> 00:43.695
Reggie,
I told you not to do this,

00:43.782 --> 00:45.175
and that means not doing it

00:45.262 --> 00:47.308
without fully understanding
the consequences.

00:47.395 --> 00:49.136
<i>Yeah.
She's the problem, isn't she?</i>

00:49.223 --> 00:50.267
Sarah's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:50.354 --> 00:51.529
Well, that's over with.

00:51.616 --> 00:53.488
No matter how much
you love a human,

00:53.575 --> 00:54.793
you will hurt them,

00:54.880 --> 00:57.796
ad you'll never
forgive yourself.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.771
I gotta thank you.

01:15.858 --> 01:18.861
Again?

01:18.948 --> 01:21.081
When I came to Oakland...

01:22.647 --> 01:25.824
I thought
I was gonna change the world.

01:25.911 --> 01:28.827
You're adorable.

01:28.914 --> 01:30.655
Never said I wasn't.

01:42.885 --> 01:45.105
But progress...

01:45.192 --> 01:46.976
it hasn't been easy.

01:49.892 --> 01:52.721
It seems like for every good
the Panthers do,

01:52.808 --> 01:54.940
there's two, three...

02:00.120 --> 02:01.643
Five setbacks.

02:04.472 --> 02:07.823
Yes, but you're...
strong now.

02:07.910 --> 02:11.043
You're powerful.

02:11.131 --> 02:15.744
But strength, speed,

02:15.831 --> 02:17.833
power...

02:17.920 --> 02:20.227
those weren't the greatest
of your gifts.

02:20.314 --> 02:22.142
Oh, yeah?

02:22.229 --> 02:23.926
What was?

02:24.013 --> 02:25.057
Time.

02:27.408 --> 02:28.713
Time?

02:32.326 --> 02:34.806
This new world
we're trying to build,

02:34.893 --> 02:36.373
it won't be built overnight.

02:38.201 --> 02:41.073
But you...

02:41.161 --> 02:43.902
you've given me a longer life
than I ever thought possible.

02:43.989 --> 02:47.079
I mean, think of everything
we can do with all those years.

02:49.734 --> 02:51.780
We will change the world.

02:54.217 --> 02:56.524
And then
we'll live long enough

02:56.611 --> 03:00.354
to watch it change again.

03:27.729 --> 03:29.774
Whoa, whoa! Mike!

03:29.861 --> 03:32.299
This is an employees-only area.
What are you doing here?

03:32.386 --> 03:33.691
Little jumpy?

03:35.824 --> 03:37.434
You'd be jumpy too if you were
booked for an Assessment

03:37.521 --> 03:40.916
that'll almost certainly
guarantee a painful death.

03:41.003 --> 03:43.962
And Maurice ghosted me
a couple days ago.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.747
So there's not much training
going on either.

03:45.834 --> 03:48.750
- Do you know where he went?
- Not a clue. You?

03:48.837 --> 03:50.404
Mm-mm.

03:52.797 --> 03:54.364
Usually my vampire GPS
lets me know.

03:54.451 --> 03:57.541
Like, you know, when I found
him in Angela's basement?

03:57.628 --> 03:59.891
But now, I have nothing.

03:59.978 --> 04:01.284
What if he's dead?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.155
Sire bond diminishes
with distance,

04:03.243 --> 04:06.333
but peril has a way
of overcoming that,

04:06.420 --> 04:09.118
so if Maurice was in danger,
you'd know.

04:09.205 --> 04:10.859
Reggie.

04:10.946 --> 04:13.731
I think you should leave Akron.
Go away from here.

04:13.818 --> 04:15.820
You trying to get rid of me?

04:15.907 --> 04:17.909
I'm trying to save you.
I mean, you said it yourself:

04:17.996 --> 04:20.085
The Assessment's
a death sentence.

04:20.172 --> 04:22.479
So why stay here
and submit to that?

04:22.566 --> 04:24.002
Because Maurice
made it pretty clear

04:24.089 --> 04:26.091
that they're gonna find me
wherever I go.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.832
Doesn't mean
it's not worth trying.

04:27.919 --> 04:29.312
Think about it.

04:29.399 --> 04:31.923
I think I'm the reason
Maurice left.

04:32.010 --> 04:34.274
I made him a promise
and I broke it.

04:34.361 --> 04:36.450
Yeah, Maurice doesn't do well
with that kind of thing.

04:36.537 --> 04:38.495
Yeah, I noticed.

04:38.582 --> 04:41.846
Maybe...

04:41.933 --> 04:45.023
I should stay here in Akron
and train.

04:45.110 --> 04:48.853
Maybe you could help me train.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.248
Save me, Mike Choi.
You're my only hope.

04:52.335 --> 04:54.250
Sorry, Reg.
This isn't my fight.

04:55.773 --> 04:57.645
You totally missed
a "Star Wars" reference!

04:58.950 --> 05:01.518
Do vampires even watch movies?

05:07.872 --> 05:09.483
Maurice?

05:22.757 --> 05:24.672
What the---- have you done?

05:24.759 --> 05:26.413
He shot me.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.632
Who? Who shot you?

05:28.719 --> 05:30.330
The cop.

05:32.157 --> 05:34.334
The one that came at me
with the nightstick.

05:34.421 --> 05:35.987
What have you done?

05:36.074 --> 05:39.208
I killed him.

05:39.295 --> 05:41.210
The bullets, they...

05:41.297 --> 05:44.692
they popped right back out
of my chest.

05:44.779 --> 05:48.260
I healed... and I fed.

05:48.348 --> 05:51.133
I gave him what he deserved, but...

05:51.220 --> 05:53.265
I just couldn't stop.

05:53.353 --> 05:54.789
Are you sure that he's dead?

05:54.876 --> 05:56.704
Maybe you just...

05:56.791 --> 06:00.098
I------- ripped his head off.

06:07.105 --> 06:09.238
Take off those clothes.

06:09.325 --> 06:12.154
I swear,
I--I didn't mean to do it.

06:12.241 --> 06:14.983
I--I wasn't gonna do anything.

06:15.070 --> 06:17.855
Look, he has been harassing
the neighborhood since day one.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.161
Oh, so what you did
was justice?

06:19.248 --> 06:20.597
Yeah! Maybe it------- was.

06:20.684 --> 06:22.382
That isn't justice.
That's vengeance.

06:22.469 --> 06:23.383
And if you don't know
the difference,

06:23.470 --> 06:24.906
we're gonna have a big problem.

06:26.995 --> 06:27.909
What's this?

06:27.996 --> 06:29.258
Think.

06:29.345 --> 06:32.130
You killed a pig
in a Black neighborhood.

06:34.394 --> 06:36.874
There's gonna be hell to pay.

06:36.961 --> 06:38.833
Yes, and we'll be long gone
when that happens.

06:38.920 --> 06:40.312
We're leaving?

06:40.400 --> 06:41.792
What about the Panthers?

06:41.879 --> 06:44.404
Are not your problem anymore.

06:44.491 --> 06:46.928
Maurice, you can live forever,

06:47.015 --> 06:49.060
but that doesn't mean
you can't die.

06:49.147 --> 06:51.411
And sometimes survival
means that you need to cut ties

06:51.498 --> 06:54.109
and disappear.

06:54.196 --> 06:56.328
We can't.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.113
The cops are gonna be
on a warpath.

06:58.200 --> 06:59.288
Yeah, well,
you should have thought of that

06:59.375 --> 07:00.724
before you killed one.

07:00.811 --> 07:02.073
What if they blame
someone innocent?

07:02.160 --> 07:03.988
Are you joking?

07:04.075 --> 07:05.860
Of course they're gonna blame
someone innocent!

07:05.947 --> 07:08.689
They're gonna blame 50 someones
while they're at it!

07:12.606 --> 07:15.347
I never meant
for this to happen.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.654
----!
- Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

07:17.741 --> 07:19.656
I know. I know.

07:19.743 --> 07:21.919
But it did.

07:22.006 --> 07:25.183
And I know
that you wanna fix it...

07:25.270 --> 07:27.185
but if you get involved
in whatever comes next,

07:27.272 --> 07:28.796
you are only gonna
make things worse.

07:28.883 --> 07:30.101
No.

07:30.188 --> 07:33.322
I promise
I won't lose control again.

07:33.409 --> 07:36.107
But you will.

07:36.194 --> 07:40.024
And that is not your fault.
Okay?

07:40.111 --> 07:44.072
You're still getting used
to this new life and...

07:44.159 --> 07:46.204
and your body's still
adjusting to the changes,

07:46.291 --> 07:48.990
and the cravings are a part
of that process.

07:49.077 --> 07:50.687
The best thing you can do
for the community

07:50.774 --> 07:52.428
is get as far away from it
as possible.

07:52.515 --> 07:55.083
You understand that, right?

07:55.170 --> 07:57.607
You get that, right?

08:00.001 --> 08:01.916
Okay.

08:02.003 --> 08:04.484
Okay, so pack your bag,
and with any luck,

08:04.571 --> 08:07.051
we'll be in Paris
by the end of the week.

08:07.138 --> 08:08.488
We're going to France?

08:08.575 --> 08:10.141
Yes.
We need to lay low,

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
but that doesn't mean
we need to live like animals.

08:12.622 --> 08:14.798
- How long?
- Not long.

08:14.885 --> 08:17.105
A decade. Maybe two.

08:19.324 --> 08:21.109
Oh, but you're gonna love it.

08:23.938 --> 08:26.506
Just wait
till you try the bread.

08:26.593 --> 08:27.550
Okay.

08:27.637 --> 08:29.117
Okay, Paris.

08:31.293 --> 08:35.166
But first... there's somewhere
we need to go.

08:40.998 --> 08:44.175
Angie, we can't just walk
around in the sunlight.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.352
What sun? Portland overcast
is our umbrella.

08:55.273 --> 08:57.885
We shouldn't be here.

08:57.972 --> 09:00.061
If I'ma disappear,

09:00.148 --> 09:02.890
I need to see my mama
one more time.

09:02.977 --> 09:05.414
She's your family,
and I get that.

09:05.501 --> 09:07.155
Hey!

09:07.242 --> 09:10.506
But you gave that up the moment
you agreed to be turned.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.643
You smell that?

09:16.730 --> 09:18.993
She made étouffée.

09:19.080 --> 09:21.386
And how could you know that?
Hmm?

09:21.473 --> 09:23.867
How could you possibly smell
that from all the way out here?

09:23.954 --> 09:25.826
- You know how I know.
- Exactly.

09:27.958 --> 09:31.701
You are no longer
the son that she knew.

09:33.311 --> 09:36.837
Look, you don't
have to come with me,

09:36.924 --> 09:39.013
but I owe her a goodbye.

09:41.798 --> 09:45.149
Of course
I'm coming with you.

09:45.236 --> 09:47.369
If I left you alone,
who knows the trail of bodies

09:47.456 --> 09:48.762
you'd leave behind.

09:48.849 --> 09:50.198
And then
that would be another mess

09:50.285 --> 09:52.330
that I'd have to clean up.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.941
Okay...

09:54.028 --> 09:56.857
<i>Hey, Mama.</i>

10:31.239 --> 10:33.023
<i>Mama?</i>

10:33.110 --> 10:36.026
<i>Angela... Angela!</i>

10:55.480 --> 10:59.876
<i>Please, everyone, sit down
while the food's still hot.</i>

10:59.963 --> 11:03.010
<i>We're grateful the good Lord
saw fit to bring you home.</i>

11:03.097 --> 11:05.012
<i>Junior, please.</i>

11:05.099 --> 11:07.841
Next time, a little warning
would be nice.

11:07.928 --> 11:10.713
Junior?

11:10.800 --> 11:12.759
My father was Maurice Senior.

11:14.064 --> 11:16.414
May the Lord
protect his soul.

11:20.941 --> 11:24.466
So, young man I don't know...

11:24.553 --> 11:26.468
He lives next door,

11:26.555 --> 11:28.775
and he helps me out when
I've made too much of a meal.

11:30.385 --> 11:32.909
Does the boy talk?

11:32.996 --> 11:36.478
Don't be rude.

11:36.565 --> 11:39.786
Looks like
you've been replaced, Junior.

11:41.918 --> 11:44.138
So Angela,

11:44.225 --> 11:46.488
do you know that you are
the first young woman

11:46.575 --> 11:49.360
that Maurice has seen fit
to introduce to his mama?

11:49.447 --> 11:51.101
I did not.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.190
It's true.

11:53.277 --> 11:55.845
And I look forward
to finding out everything

11:55.932 --> 11:57.542
there is to know about you.

12:00.371 --> 12:02.634
Would you care
to offer us the grace?

12:03.984 --> 12:06.116
I'll pass.

12:07.901 --> 12:10.947
Angela's just joking, Ma.

12:11.034 --> 12:14.211
I was hoping
maybe I could say it myself.

12:14.298 --> 12:16.213
That would be lovely.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.483
Bless us, oh Lord,
for these Thy gifts

12:25.570 --> 12:28.312
in which we are about
to receive from Thy bounty.

12:28.399 --> 12:31.663
Through Christ our Lord, amen.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.448
Mm, amen.

12:41.238 --> 12:43.066
Oh, Mama, one scoop's enough, please.

12:43.153 --> 12:45.677
Oh, look at you.
You're too skinny.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.636
What are they feeding you
down there in California?

12:47.723 --> 12:50.291
Pig.

12:50.378 --> 12:51.771
Mostly.

12:55.644 --> 12:59.387
Well, at least someone
enjoys my cooking, hmm?

12:59.474 --> 13:02.172
I'm not in an eating contest
with the neighbor boy, Ma.

13:02.259 --> 13:04.566
It's a good thing,
because you'd lose.

13:07.917 --> 13:12.226
So where are you from,
Angela Hibbert?

13:12.313 --> 13:14.706
The British West Indies.

13:14.794 --> 13:18.754
Surely no one called them
that when you were a child.

13:20.538 --> 13:22.671
Uh, so, Ma.

13:22.758 --> 13:25.065
How's St. Andrew's?

13:25.152 --> 13:27.719
They ever get
that broken step fixed?

13:27.807 --> 13:28.982
No, they keep saying
they're going to,

13:29.069 --> 13:30.940
but nothing ever happens.

13:31.027 --> 13:33.160
Maybe now that you're home
you can walk over there.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.596
Lend a hand.

13:34.683 --> 13:36.598
And that reminds me,
after dinner,

13:36.685 --> 13:38.861
why don't you put the cot
in the living room?

13:38.948 --> 13:41.255
That way Angela can sleep
in the bedroom.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.213
That won't be necessary.

13:45.215 --> 13:47.435
We won't be staying.

13:48.566 --> 13:50.090
Just one night.

13:53.528 --> 13:55.269
Can I talk to you for a second?

13:57.184 --> 14:00.361
Privately.

14:00.448 --> 14:01.710
Excuse me, Mom.

14:06.584 --> 14:08.195
Here.

14:13.461 --> 14:15.811
Look, I know this isn't
what we agreed to but--

14:15.898 --> 14:17.291
Yo, wait. What are you doing?

14:17.378 --> 14:19.859
Relieving some stress.

14:19.946 --> 14:22.774
But my mother
is right through that wall.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.429
We did not come here
to play------- house.

14:25.516 --> 14:28.780
Say what you need to say,
and let's go.

14:41.358 --> 14:43.447
That's a nice little
greenhouse you got there.

14:45.972 --> 14:49.453
Uh, yeah.
It's just a hobby.

14:49.540 --> 14:51.194
Name's Landry.

14:51.281 --> 14:54.632
Maurice.

14:54.719 --> 14:56.156
Yeah, that "For Sale" sign's
been out there

14:56.243 --> 14:57.635
for some time now.

14:57.722 --> 14:59.028
You must be the new owner.

14:59.115 --> 15:00.769
I don't wanna be too nosy,

15:00.856 --> 15:04.033
but I hope you didn't pay
market price for that.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.862
Rumor is that some
pretty crazy shit

15:06.949 --> 15:09.125
happened there back in the day.

15:09.212 --> 15:10.648
Mm.

15:12.650 --> 15:14.217
Yeah, maybe, uh,

15:14.304 --> 15:15.784
maybe you could help me out
with something.

15:15.871 --> 15:17.786
I'm happy to oblige, neighbor.

15:17.873 --> 15:19.309
Last time I was in town,

15:19.396 --> 15:21.790
there was a root shop
in Albina.

15:21.877 --> 15:24.097
You ever heard of it?

15:24.184 --> 15:26.099
I was wondering
if it's still open.

15:26.186 --> 15:27.317
I saw the greenhouse

15:27.404 --> 15:29.711
and figured
you might be familiar.

15:29.798 --> 15:32.714
Root shop, huh?

15:32.801 --> 15:34.977
You mean like hoodoo
and what have ya?

15:35.064 --> 15:36.892
I'm looking
for a particular herb.

15:36.979 --> 15:38.589
You need it fresh to make tea.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.156
Ah.

15:40.243 --> 15:42.811
So you're a fancy tea drinker, huh?

15:42.898 --> 15:44.682
Yeah, something like that.

15:44.769 --> 15:47.250
Well, I got no idea,
to be honest.

15:47.337 --> 15:49.818
I only bought this place
a few years back.

15:49.905 --> 15:53.387
I'm not what you'd call
a... a local.

15:53.474 --> 15:55.258
Worth a shot.

15:55.345 --> 15:56.607
Thanks for your time.

15:56.694 --> 15:58.522
All right.

16:09.838 --> 16:13.537
How long that neighbor boy
been eating dinner over here?

16:13.624 --> 16:15.539
Three months.

16:15.626 --> 16:17.237
His mother passed.

16:17.324 --> 16:19.717
Poor child
hasn't spoken a word since.

16:21.110 --> 16:22.503
I'm sure it doesn't help

16:22.590 --> 16:24.896
that his father
is too committed to his drink

16:24.984 --> 16:27.421
to remember three square meals.

16:32.643 --> 16:36.778
So you gonna tell me,
or are you gonna make me ask?

16:36.865 --> 16:38.214
Is she pregnant?

16:38.301 --> 16:41.783
Angela? No, no.

16:41.870 --> 16:43.045
So I'm not planning
a wedding?

16:43.132 --> 16:45.134
- Jesus Christ.
- Hey!

16:45.221 --> 16:47.963
I raised you better
than to take His name in vain.

16:48.050 --> 16:49.747
Sorry.

16:49.834 --> 16:51.619
And as for the other thing,

16:51.706 --> 16:56.189
you show up here with a girl
I've heard bo-peep about.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.321
What am I supposed to think?
- No one is getting pregnant

16:58.408 --> 16:59.453
and no one is getting married.

16:59.540 --> 17:00.584
Good.

17:04.023 --> 17:06.329
Here we go.
- Well, can you blame me?

17:06.416 --> 17:08.201
The girl did not want
to say grace.

17:08.288 --> 17:10.159
I'm not here
to talk about Angela.

17:12.118 --> 17:14.729
Why are you here?

17:33.530 --> 17:35.054
Did you bring it?

17:35.141 --> 17:36.316
Unregistered and loaded

17:36.403 --> 17:38.144
with the Butcher's
phone number.

17:38.231 --> 17:39.841
Her name is Nikki.

17:39.928 --> 17:42.583
Are you sure bringing on
Nikki is a good idea?

17:42.670 --> 17:44.280
She's unpredictable
and extreme.

17:44.367 --> 17:46.326
She's crazy.

17:46.413 --> 17:48.632
Yes, you can aim her
at the Blob,

17:48.719 --> 17:51.940
but can you be sure
he will be her only victim?

17:52.027 --> 17:54.986
- Okay. You're being dramatic.
- Am I?

17:55.074 --> 17:58.251
You were in Buenos Aires
when she earned her moniker.

17:58.338 --> 18:01.906
She ripped out that man's
spine and fed it to his wife.

18:05.432 --> 18:07.390
If you think
you can control her,

18:07.477 --> 18:10.524
by all means, call her.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.366
Wow, Mama.

18:26.453 --> 18:27.845
Oh, oh.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.891
Oh, this looks amazing.

18:29.978 --> 18:31.371
Oh, man.

18:31.458 --> 18:32.372
Ah!

18:35.070 --> 18:39.814
Maurice, is everything okay?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.555
I--
Yeah.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.948
Yeah, I'm just, uh...

18:44.035 --> 18:45.863
I'm not feeling too good.

18:45.950 --> 18:48.562
Think I'ma go lay down
for a bit.

18:48.649 --> 18:50.607
- What?
- Yeah.

18:54.133 --> 18:57.005
Don't worry, Irma.
I'll take good care of him.

19:03.403 --> 19:05.753
You're being careless.

19:05.840 --> 19:08.451
It was an accident.

19:08.538 --> 19:12.847
And how long before
she notices we avoid the sun?

19:12.934 --> 19:16.416
I know it's hard to accept,
but you don't belong here.

19:16.503 --> 19:18.548
She's still my mama.

19:18.635 --> 19:20.246
If she finds out
what you are,

19:20.333 --> 19:22.204
she will try to kill you.

19:22.291 --> 19:24.467
We need to go.

19:24.554 --> 19:26.556
Tonight.

19:26.643 --> 19:28.167
And we will.

19:28.254 --> 19:29.733
Soon.

19:29.820 --> 19:31.735
But not tonight.
- Maurice.

19:31.822 --> 19:34.042
Look, I just need
a little more time.

19:43.617 --> 19:45.793
Hey, you find
what you were looking for?

19:47.360 --> 19:48.752
Not yet.

19:48.839 --> 19:50.841
Well, maybe I can help.

19:50.928 --> 19:55.324
What sort of, uh, spooky kabuki
were you trying to find?

19:55.411 --> 19:57.196
It's called
Herb of the Cross.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.719
You ever heard of it?

19:58.806 --> 20:01.069
Can't say I have,

20:01.156 --> 20:03.245
but why don't you come on
up here and share a drink

20:03.332 --> 20:05.900
with an old man and you can
tell me all about it?

20:05.987 --> 20:07.467
That's very kind,
but no thank you.

20:07.554 --> 20:08.772
Are you sure?

20:08.859 --> 20:11.384
I mean, it's--
it's not your fancy tea,

20:11.471 --> 20:14.038
but it's... it's good.

20:14.125 --> 20:16.302
Maybe next time.

20:25.006 --> 20:27.051
Long time no see, Eve.

20:27.138 --> 20:29.750
Ange, I love your home.

20:29.837 --> 20:32.100
Oh, I'm sure
the Council provided you

20:32.187 --> 20:33.362
with adequate
living arrangements

20:33.449 --> 20:34.711
in your own district.

20:34.798 --> 20:36.278
Uh, too many windows
for my taste,

20:36.365 --> 20:38.324
but the locals are delicious.

20:38.411 --> 20:41.849
Climate like that requires
an extra layer of fat.

20:41.936 --> 20:45.940
Eve, what are you doing here?

20:46.027 --> 20:48.508
Being regional manager
of the Yukon was a promotion,

20:48.595 --> 20:50.597
but do you have any idea
how long the days are

20:50.684 --> 20:52.076
in the summer?

20:52.163 --> 20:54.165
Too long.

20:54.253 --> 20:56.429
So you're on vacation?

20:56.516 --> 20:58.953
In Akron.

20:59.040 --> 21:01.782
Call it "stopping by
on my way to the big city."

21:01.869 --> 21:05.786
Eve, there's something
you're not telling me.

21:05.873 --> 21:07.309
Might be.

21:09.703 --> 21:11.444
Well, you know how I am
about rumors,

21:11.531 --> 21:13.010
especially the scandalous kind.

21:13.097 --> 21:14.708
Oh, I remember.

21:14.795 --> 21:17.624
Well, rumor has it

21:17.711 --> 21:19.756
Maurice Miller
is back in your life,

21:19.843 --> 21:23.151
and that is something I had
to see up close and personal.

21:23.238 --> 21:25.762
Maurice is a recent arrival
but has yet to file

21:25.849 --> 21:27.373
for official
district citizenship.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.027
Ange, please.

21:30.114 --> 21:33.248
This is Eve you're talking to.

21:33.335 --> 21:36.251
If anyone understands
how thankless the work is,

21:36.338 --> 21:38.862
it's me.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.560
Give a little.

21:40.647 --> 21:42.083
That son of a bitch

21:42.170 --> 21:43.432
tried to bring Angel's Blood
into my city.

21:47.654 --> 21:50.309
Angel's Blood.

21:50.396 --> 21:52.136
Whatever for?

21:52.223 --> 21:53.486
It's Maurice.

21:53.573 --> 21:55.183
Who knows what the hell
he was thinking?

21:55.270 --> 21:56.619
What happened
to the supplier?

21:56.706 --> 21:58.882
He paid
the appropriate price.

21:58.969 --> 22:00.971
But believe it or not,
I have an even bigger problem

22:01.058 --> 22:02.321
on my plate.

22:04.279 --> 22:05.976
Oh, don't be such a tease.

22:06.063 --> 22:08.065
Give.

22:08.152 --> 22:11.199
Reginald Andres.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.855
They call him
"the Fat Vampire."

22:14.942 --> 22:16.770
Bail on me in my time
of need, Maurice?

22:16.857 --> 22:18.511
Not cool.

22:18.598 --> 22:20.556
Do I need you? Yes.

22:20.643 --> 22:21.818
Am I gonna pretend
that I don't?

22:21.905 --> 22:23.472
Also yes,
because it's time to train,

22:23.559 --> 22:25.561
and I am fully capable
of training myself.

22:25.648 --> 22:28.172
Although, if you were here,

22:28.259 --> 22:29.217
I probably wouldn't have
to talk to myself,

22:29.304 --> 22:31.915
but--nothing.
But nothing!

22:32.002 --> 22:33.090
Forget that noise.

22:35.092 --> 22:37.225
You got this.

22:37.312 --> 22:38.922
You are this.

22:42.752 --> 22:44.885
One. Yeah.

22:44.972 --> 22:46.321
Two.

22:46.408 --> 22:47.931
Come on.

22:48.018 --> 22:49.411
Ooh.

22:49.498 --> 22:50.934
Ow.

23:48.514 --> 23:49.950
Hey, Mike Choi.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.213
I saw "Star Wars"
the night it premiered,

23:52.300 --> 23:55.129
and I prefer my Joseph Campbell
in book form.

23:55.216 --> 23:57.914
Counterpoint.
Common misperception.

23:58.001 --> 23:59.176
Lucas and Campbell
were actually friends.

23:59.263 --> 24:00.874
In fact, did you know Lucas--

24:00.961 --> 24:02.832
Oh, okay, fine!

24:02.919 --> 24:05.966
I'll train you. Okay?

24:07.968 --> 24:09.360
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

24:11.928 --> 24:13.582
What happened
to this not being your fight?

24:13.669 --> 24:15.845
You and I have
something in common.

24:15.932 --> 24:17.368
What, nice cheekbones?

24:17.456 --> 24:18.979
A second chance.

24:19.066 --> 24:20.546
We both want one.

24:20.633 --> 24:21.982
And I figure helping you

24:22.069 --> 24:24.027
is a step
in the right direction.

24:24.114 --> 24:26.029
But why do you need
a second chance?

24:26.116 --> 24:27.422
We get through this thing
in one piece,

24:27.509 --> 24:30.512
and I'll tell you
the whole sad story.

24:34.342 --> 24:35.561
Copy that.

24:40.740 --> 24:43.699
You call that chopping?

24:43.786 --> 24:47.007
Matter of fact.

24:47.094 --> 24:50.053
Well, watch me.

24:50.140 --> 24:52.186
Maybe you'll learn
a thing or two.

24:52.273 --> 24:54.449
First thing with a pepper,
you gotta cut half an inch

24:54.536 --> 24:58.845
off the top and the bottom.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.717
And then you save these
for later.

25:01.804 --> 25:04.503
Mama, can I talk to you
for a second?

25:04.590 --> 25:05.721
There's something
I need to tell you.

25:05.808 --> 25:08.115
I'm working here, Junior.

25:08.202 --> 25:11.771
Then you slice the flesh,
and you take out the core.

25:11.858 --> 25:14.513
No, Mama, please.
Just a second.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.518
Well, what is it?

25:19.605 --> 25:22.825
I'm leaving.

25:22.912 --> 25:24.131
- Already? You haven't even...
- No.

25:24.218 --> 25:26.829
- Had dinner.
- No, Mama. I'm leaving.

25:26.916 --> 25:29.528
Angela and I,
we're going on a trip.

25:29.615 --> 25:31.791
A long trip and...

25:31.878 --> 25:34.271
I'm not sure when
I'm gonna be back.

25:34.358 --> 25:35.969
And where are you headed to?

25:36.056 --> 25:38.362
France maybe. I'm not sure.

25:38.449 --> 25:40.408
We might be moving around
a bit.

25:42.715 --> 25:45.500
I take it things
in Oakland didn't work out?

25:51.245 --> 25:53.900
There was a guy I knew
over there.

25:53.987 --> 25:56.424
I thought he was the hippest
brother in town.

25:56.511 --> 25:58.818
He'd see cops bothering kids

25:58.905 --> 26:01.081
for just playing in the spray
of a hydrant and--

26:01.168 --> 26:03.474
and he'd step in.

26:03.562 --> 26:06.956
He'd get knocked down,
but he always got back up.

26:07.043 --> 26:10.264
Thought he was invincible.

26:10.351 --> 26:13.354
That dumb fool thought
he would change the world.

26:15.443 --> 26:20.317
"Blessed are those who mourn,
for they shall be comforted."

26:23.712 --> 26:25.888
Gospel of Matthew.

26:25.975 --> 26:29.413
Seems I raised you right
after all.

26:31.851 --> 26:36.246
There is no shame
in catching your breath.

26:36.333 --> 26:39.423
Whether it is
for one night or one year,

26:39.510 --> 26:42.775
you can stay here
as long as you'd like.

26:45.429 --> 26:47.736
Now get back to chopping.

26:47.823 --> 26:50.086
Exactly like I demonstrated.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.786
Come on.

26:53.873 --> 26:55.352
Good.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.582
Angela.

27:07.669 --> 27:11.194
Hey, look, we need to talk.

27:11.281 --> 27:13.806
To say you wanna stay
in Portland with your mother.

27:13.893 --> 27:15.155
Don't you?

27:15.242 --> 27:17.070
You knew.

27:17.157 --> 27:18.637
She needs you.

27:20.987 --> 27:24.425
And you need her.

27:24.512 --> 27:26.688
Would I rather you prioritized
your own safety

27:26.775 --> 27:27.994
and came with me?

27:28.081 --> 27:30.997
Yes.

27:31.084 --> 27:33.956
But I'm not gonna force you
to leave.

27:34.043 --> 27:36.655
Wow, um...

27:36.742 --> 27:38.308
I really thought
this conversation

27:38.395 --> 27:39.353
was gonna be a lot harder.

27:41.311 --> 27:42.530
Thank you for understanding.

27:42.617 --> 27:43.662
Of course.

27:45.968 --> 27:49.885
And I brought you
a little parting gift.

27:57.414 --> 27:58.764
Who--who is this?

27:58.851 --> 28:02.811
I think I'm your dinner.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.291
Oh, don't worry, she won't
remember anything tomorrow.

28:04.378 --> 28:05.640
Are you crazy?

28:05.727 --> 28:08.208
My mother
is right down those stairs.

28:08.295 --> 28:11.385
She could walk up here
any minute.

28:11.472 --> 28:13.126
I'll make sure she doesn't.

28:15.737 --> 28:18.566
Come on.
You haven't fed in days.

28:18.653 --> 28:21.264
I can't leave you
on an empty stomach,

28:21.351 --> 28:25.355
especially considering
what happened in Oakland.

28:25.442 --> 28:28.750
And I am hungry.

28:36.410 --> 28:37.716
Watch the door.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.543
You bet I will.

28:39.630 --> 28:41.589
Mmm...

28:41.676 --> 28:44.984
Good boy.

29:04.699 --> 29:06.745
That's a good boy.

29:06.832 --> 29:08.050
Drink.

29:09.704 --> 29:11.445
She tastes good, doesn't she?

29:11.532 --> 29:13.926
Mmm.

29:14.013 --> 29:15.797
Drink.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.473
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

29:39.560 --> 29:41.649
Get out of my house.

29:41.736 --> 29:43.477
Monster!
- Hmm.

29:43.564 --> 29:45.218
So you know what I am?

29:45.305 --> 29:47.350
I know you don't belong here.

29:47.437 --> 29:48.874
The love of a mother

29:48.961 --> 29:51.093
is a incredible thing,
isn't it?

29:51.180 --> 29:54.444
Unconditional. Dangerous.

29:54.531 --> 29:56.359
Blind.

29:56.446 --> 29:58.884
Take Oakland, for example.

29:58.971 --> 30:00.973
Do you have any idea
why we really left?

30:01.060 --> 30:03.584
A friend of Maurice's died.

30:03.671 --> 30:06.239
I don't think that cop
he killed was a friend of his.

30:06.326 --> 30:07.718
No. You're lying!

30:07.806 --> 30:09.895
Ripped his head clean off
with his teeth.

30:09.982 --> 30:12.071
No. Maurice is not a killer!

30:12.158 --> 30:13.855
See what I mean?

30:13.942 --> 30:15.248
Blind.

30:15.335 --> 30:16.249
No matter what
he may have done,

30:16.336 --> 30:18.251
he is never so far gone

30:18.338 --> 30:19.687
he can't come home to me.

30:19.774 --> 30:21.080
He's my son.

30:21.167 --> 30:23.343
Was your son.

30:23.430 --> 30:25.780
And now he belongs to me.
- No!

30:25.867 --> 30:27.303
No!

30:27.390 --> 30:28.478
Aah!

30:44.799 --> 30:47.193
What was Maurice thinking?

30:47.280 --> 30:49.412
A plus-size vampire?

30:49.499 --> 30:50.936
How precious.

30:51.023 --> 30:53.373
A problem
that will soon be solved.

30:53.460 --> 30:55.070
To you, Angela.

30:55.157 --> 30:57.377
For breaking the rules
without a second thought.

30:59.118 --> 31:00.597
I didn't turn him.

31:00.684 --> 31:03.078
But you are
regional director.

31:03.165 --> 31:04.863
Whether you had a hand in it
or not,

31:04.950 --> 31:07.430
an abomination was born
on your watch.

31:07.517 --> 31:09.389
If you weren't under
a microscope before,

31:09.476 --> 31:10.869
you are now.

31:10.956 --> 31:12.305
Thanks for sharing.

31:12.392 --> 31:14.263
Mm.

31:14.350 --> 31:17.527
I take it his Assessment
must already be in the works?

31:17.614 --> 31:19.442
Of course it is.

31:19.529 --> 31:21.227
I can't wait to hear
what the Council thinks

31:21.314 --> 31:23.403
of you wasting
Logan the Hellbender's time

31:23.490 --> 31:24.665
with this.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.754
How utterly delightful.

31:26.841 --> 31:29.061
I thought
you were on vacation.

31:29.148 --> 31:31.280
I am. In New York.

31:31.367 --> 31:34.109
For my performance review.

31:34.196 --> 31:38.722
I'm hoping for a promotion,
but you know how it works.

31:38.809 --> 31:41.073
For one to rise,
another must fall.

32:34.256 --> 32:35.954
Mama.

32:38.130 --> 32:39.958
Mama. Mama!

32:40.045 --> 32:43.439
No. Angela!

32:43.526 --> 32:45.354
Angela,
what the---- did you do?

32:45.441 --> 32:46.747
Mama.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.749
- Junior.
- Oh!

32:48.836 --> 32:50.881
Stop squeezing me.

32:50.969 --> 32:54.233
Maurice, what happened to you?

32:54.320 --> 32:56.975
You're--you're alive.

32:57.062 --> 32:58.498
What kind of a question
is that?

32:58.585 --> 33:00.500
Of course I'm alive.

33:00.587 --> 33:03.111
I'm--I'm just...

33:03.198 --> 33:04.765
I'm hungry.

33:07.768 --> 33:10.597
Why are you looking
at me like that?

33:10.684 --> 33:13.165
Ow.

33:13.252 --> 33:14.862
My teeth.

33:14.949 --> 33:17.386
What--why are they?

33:17.473 --> 33:18.909
Angela.

33:18.997 --> 33:20.868
What did she do to me?

33:20.955 --> 33:24.306
Why do--why do I feel so alive?

33:24.393 --> 33:27.570
You were never gonna
leave her.

33:27.657 --> 33:30.443
And now you don't have to.

33:30.530 --> 33:34.621
I've given you your mother
in the only way possible.

33:34.708 --> 33:37.015
What did you do to me?

33:37.102 --> 33:38.103
I freed you.

33:38.190 --> 33:40.757
Don't you dare talk to her.

33:40.844 --> 33:43.586
She was gonna die anyways.

33:43.673 --> 33:46.111
Sooner than later.

33:47.547 --> 33:50.767
You're still so young.

33:50.854 --> 33:54.336
You don't understand
how brief humans are.

33:54.423 --> 33:56.817
I found a way
to keep you two together.

33:56.904 --> 33:59.254
You actually believe that?

33:59.341 --> 34:01.300
Why aren't you happy?

34:04.955 --> 34:07.436
Wait, Mama! Mama, wait!

34:07.523 --> 34:08.829
You can't leave.

34:08.916 --> 34:10.700
No, I can't--
I can't stay.

34:10.787 --> 34:11.962
Not with her.

34:12.050 --> 34:13.486
Father John
will know what to do.

34:13.573 --> 34:15.096
No, no,
you aren't going anywhere.

34:15.183 --> 34:16.532
Okay? Not while the sun's out.

34:16.619 --> 34:17.838
If you do, you'll burn.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.753
- I'm gonna burn anyway.
- No, no!

34:19.840 --> 34:21.233
I mean you'll burn.

34:25.715 --> 34:28.327
Look. Look at me.

34:28.414 --> 34:30.590
Things are different
for you now.

34:30.677 --> 34:33.593
Okay? You have to adjust
to a whole new way of life.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.986
But I'll be here for you. Okay?

34:36.074 --> 34:38.946
I'll be here to help you
every step of the way.

34:39.033 --> 34:42.210
Did you kill
that police officer?

34:42.297 --> 34:45.039
Tell me she made you do it.

34:45.126 --> 34:49.391
Tell me this change
didn't turn you into a killer.

34:49.478 --> 34:51.306
Mom, Mama.

34:51.393 --> 34:53.178
Mama, it's more complicated
than that.

34:53.265 --> 34:55.267
Oh, no. I can't.

34:55.354 --> 34:57.747
I can't be what you've become.

34:57.834 --> 34:59.445
I can't, Maurice.

34:59.532 --> 35:01.273
I won't. I won't.
- No, Mama.

35:01.360 --> 35:02.578
- No.
- Please don't do this.

35:02.665 --> 35:04.580
Listen, it's gonna be okay.

35:04.667 --> 35:06.321
It's gonna be okay.

35:08.236 --> 35:12.284
The--the Lord just needs me
to take a few more steps.

35:20.422 --> 35:22.859
"Come to me,

35:22.946 --> 35:27.212
"all you who are weary
and burdened,

35:27.299 --> 35:29.997
and I will give you rest."

35:37.439 --> 35:39.398
Mama, I c--I can't.

35:42.227 --> 35:45.534
It's okay.

35:45.621 --> 35:47.971
Your father and I
will be waiting for you...

35:49.886 --> 35:52.759
When you're ready.

35:54.152 --> 35:57.111
No. No, Ma-Mama, please.

35:57.198 --> 35:58.678
Mama, please don't do this!

36:01.202 --> 36:02.290
Mom.

36:04.597 --> 36:06.381
Please don't do this.

36:10.080 --> 36:11.256
Mom!

36:11.343 --> 36:13.345
- Aah!
- Mama!

36:35.323 --> 36:38.021
Time to go.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.113
I'm gonna kill you.

36:44.941 --> 36:47.596
Don't be cute.

36:47.683 --> 36:50.730
I let you sit there
like a sad little rag doll

36:50.817 --> 36:52.558
all day long.

36:52.645 --> 36:54.386
But the sun is down,

36:54.473 --> 36:56.257
and we have a lot of ground
to cover,

36:56.344 --> 36:59.086
so get up.

37:00.914 --> 37:03.438
I don't know how

37:03.525 --> 37:06.702
and I don't know when...

37:06.789 --> 37:10.315
but the one thing I do know

37:10.402 --> 37:13.143
is that I have time.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.797
I made you.

37:18.627 --> 37:20.412
But you made me too.

37:43.043 --> 37:46.307
Pardon the intrusion, neighbor.

37:46.394 --> 37:48.483
But I got
a particularly beefy wardrobe

37:48.570 --> 37:50.398
that needs moving,
and my old back isn't sure

37:50.485 --> 37:51.834
it can take it today.

37:51.921 --> 37:53.923
Any chance I could offer you
a liquid bribe

37:54.010 --> 37:55.621
for some help?

37:55.708 --> 37:58.754
No bribe necessary.

37:58.841 --> 38:01.453
All right.

38:10.026 --> 38:11.332
Okay.

38:11.419 --> 38:13.334
Oh, come on in.

38:16.772 --> 38:20.080
I'll have the lights up
in two shakes of a maraca.

38:26.826 --> 38:28.958
Do you remember me now?

38:32.962 --> 38:34.747
You're the neighbor boy.

38:34.834 --> 38:37.706
And you are a vampire.

38:39.795 --> 38:41.841
Everyone thought I was crazy.

38:41.928 --> 38:44.322
That I didn't see her
burst into flame.

38:45.845 --> 38:47.803
But I know what I saw.

38:47.890 --> 38:49.544
And I know what you are.

38:51.590 --> 38:54.506
And I knew you'd be back.

38:56.812 --> 38:58.814
Holy water.

38:58.901 --> 39:00.903
Ordered it from the Vatican.

39:00.990 --> 39:04.167
Blessed by the pope.

39:04.254 --> 39:10.173
Sticks carved from trees
in Jerusalem.

39:10.260 --> 39:13.002
Daggers edged in wood.

39:17.616 --> 39:21.315
And this.

39:23.752 --> 39:27.800
You know, at first I considered
building a cage of silver.

39:27.887 --> 39:32.935
Then I discovered
the Devil's Trap.

39:33.022 --> 39:35.068
And what better way to catch
a creature of the night

39:35.155 --> 39:36.896
than to use its own dark energy
against it?

39:39.594 --> 39:45.600
You'll never leave this room
without my permission.

39:45.687 --> 39:49.430
Uh, not that you'll live
long enough for it to matter.

39:49.517 --> 39:52.868
I'm sorry.

39:52.955 --> 39:56.219
I'm sorry that hate
consumed you.

39:56.306 --> 39:58.613
That you never got
to live your life.

39:58.700 --> 40:01.703
That all you had was revenge.

40:01.790 --> 40:04.271
I lost my mother that day.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.795
Trust me.

40:06.882 --> 40:08.797
I know how that feels.

40:08.884 --> 40:12.888
You're sorry?

40:12.975 --> 40:16.326
You're------- sorry?

40:16.414 --> 40:19.460
I was left alone...

40:19.547 --> 40:21.549
with <i>him.</i>

40:24.726 --> 40:26.249
Your father.

40:26.336 --> 40:28.861
Oh, that man was no father.

40:28.948 --> 40:31.298
Not like you had.

40:31.385 --> 40:33.648
Your parents loved each other.

40:33.735 --> 40:36.738
Your mother loved you like
a parent's supposed to.

40:39.349 --> 40:42.440
She was the closest thing
I had to family.

40:42.527 --> 40:46.487
And you took her from me.

40:50.578 --> 40:52.101
But...

40:52.188 --> 40:53.755
the Devil's Trap.

40:53.842 --> 40:56.323
That's just some shit
they made up in movies.

40:58.368 --> 40:59.979
Listen to me.

41:00.066 --> 41:01.676
You're gonna forget
about vampires,

41:01.763 --> 41:04.679
about me, my mother,

41:04.766 --> 41:07.247
and you're gonna
move on with your life.

41:07.334 --> 41:09.597
Oh.

41:09.684 --> 41:11.904
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:11.991 --> 41:13.601
Yeah, that's right.

41:13.688 --> 41:15.473
Your mind control
won't work on me.

41:15.560 --> 41:17.605
- You have Herb of the Cross.
- And don't even dare

41:17.692 --> 41:19.955
try and suck my blood.

41:20.042 --> 41:23.219
I've been drinking the Herb
every day for decades.

41:23.306 --> 41:25.134
Not only am I immune,

41:25.221 --> 41:26.919
I'm toxic.

41:27.006 --> 41:28.573
Where did you get it?

41:30.792 --> 41:32.664
You've been growing it,
haven't you?

41:32.751 --> 41:34.579
It's been here the whole time.

41:34.666 --> 41:36.537
And why do you wanna know
about that herb?

41:36.624 --> 41:37.973
Huh?

41:38.060 --> 41:40.193
It's protection
against monsters like you.

41:40.280 --> 41:42.630
I wish you hadn't drank
that herb.

41:42.717 --> 41:44.980
If I could've glamoured you,
this would've been easy.

41:45.067 --> 41:47.548
But nothing's ever easy.

42:29.503 --> 42:30.765
Nikki?

42:30.852 --> 42:33.246
Hey, it's Angela.

42:33.333 --> 42:36.031
I have a problem

42:36.118 --> 42:39.731
that requires
your special... touch.

42:41.123 --> 42:44.431
His name is Reginald Andres.
