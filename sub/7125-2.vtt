00:03.166 --> 00:06.333
[Samantha] I had this dream.
I was hit by a car.

00:06.333 --> 00:10.417
I lost my memory
and moved in with my parents.

00:10.417 --> 00:13.291
Rise and shine!
Wake up, sleepyhead.

00:13.291 --> 00:16.417
You're not in a coma anymore.
Come on. Get up.

00:16.417 --> 00:19.542
We got a busy day. We're gonna
get our hair cut, just alike!

00:21.792 --> 00:23.959
[Samantha] Oh, please
let it be a dream.

00:23.959 --> 00:24.959
[groans]

00:31.667 --> 00:33.000
[door opens]

00:33.959 --> 00:37.750
Oh, it's OK. I'm your father.

00:37.750 --> 00:41.750
- Yeah, I know. You told me.
- [Regina] Samantha, breakfast.

00:41.750 --> 00:44.667
And that's your mother.
She's in the kitchen.

00:44.667 --> 00:47.000
Yeah, see, I remember
what I know now.

00:47.000 --> 00:50.000
It's just not anything that
I knew before the accident.

00:50.000 --> 00:53.917
And the kitchen
is where we keep the food.

00:53.917 --> 00:57.208
Oh, that's good to know.
Excuse me.

00:57.208 --> 00:58.959
Oh, there she is.

00:58.959 --> 01:02.500
Samantha, you remember your
childhood friend, Dena.

01:02.500 --> 01:07.375
Well, I had off from work so
I thought I'd see if you wanted
to do something.

01:07.375 --> 01:10.959
- I'm sorry,
she's busy with me today.
- Uh, actually, I was going to

01:10.959 --> 01:13.959
- be busy with me today.
- That doesn't sound
like any fun.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.542
If we're not gonna
get to know each other again,

01:16.542 --> 01:20.125
- what was the point
of you getting hit?
- Um, that's very true, but,

01:20.125 --> 01:22.458
I was in this coma
and I have no memories.

01:22.458 --> 01:25.000
I kind of just
want to find out who I am.

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
I mean, I don't even
know what I do.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.166
- I don't know what my job is.
- I don't know.

01:29.166 --> 01:32.041
- You haven't spoken
to me in two years.
- Twenty for me.

01:32.041 --> 01:34.083
I think it was something
in a building.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.166
Oh, well, I guess that
rules out astronaut then.

01:37.166 --> 01:39.542
Hey, you know what?
Maybe I have some sort of

01:39.542 --> 01:41.959
business card
or something like that.

01:41.959 --> 01:43.250
Let's see. What do we got?

01:43.250 --> 01:45.709
I have a doctor's appointment
card. For today.

01:45.709 --> 01:46.959
Who's Dr. Kegoshian?

01:46.959 --> 01:50.417
Wait, from the hospital?
Oh, is he the brain doctor?

01:50.417 --> 01:52.625
Or the guy who got us
to donate her organs?

01:52.625 --> 01:54.834
Oh, I liked him. He was funny.

01:54.834 --> 01:57.333
All right. Well, so,
I'll keep this appointment.

01:57.333 --> 02:00.667
You and I can get to know
each other when you drive me
into the city.

02:00.667 --> 02:04.083
Don't you remember? I told you
I'm getting my hair trimmed.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.834
Howard, she's starting
to forget things again.

02:10.166 --> 02:13.000
Sorry. You must have
berries in your shampoo.

02:13.000 --> 02:15.166
- Mr. Cellophane, no!
- [dog groans]

02:15.166 --> 02:19.875
No, it's fine. Thank you
for the ride, Dena. It's just...

02:19.875 --> 02:21.834
Oh, God, mothers, right?

02:21.834 --> 02:24.041
It's like...
What is that, you know?

02:24.041 --> 02:28.458
It's like, enough already,
just go away. Right?

02:28.458 --> 02:30.208
Mine's dead.

02:30.208 --> 02:35.083
- My God. I'm sorry.
- No, please, you have amnesia.

02:35.083 --> 02:37.500
But you were real sweet
when you found out.

02:37.500 --> 02:41.500
You even insisted that we move
the day of the funeral so you
could be there.

02:41.500 --> 02:42.959
Oh. I did that?

02:42.959 --> 02:48.417
Yeah. You still didn't come, but
you sent some beautiful flowers.

02:48.417 --> 02:51.750
Well, there's that.

02:55.959 --> 02:58.000
I didn't send
any flowers, did I?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.959
- Not really.
- Yeah.

03:03.583 --> 03:05.709
All things considered,
I feel fine.

03:05.709 --> 03:07.834
- I mean, physically.
- Open, please?

03:07.834 --> 03:09.125
Maybe my mom's right.

03:09.125 --> 03:12.125
Maybe I am too eager to
get back into my life, you know,

03:12.125 --> 03:15.166
but when everything is a
mystery, you really want to...

03:15.166 --> 03:18.750
...grab hold and squeeze...

03:18.750 --> 03:20.959
You're not a neurologist,
are you?

03:20.959 --> 03:23.500
So have you decided
to go up one cup size or two?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.166
Is there a three?
I mean, just...

03:34.750 --> 03:37.000
Hey, Andrea! AndrÃ©a.

03:37.000 --> 03:39.166
- Whatever it is. Hey.
- Hi.

03:39.166 --> 03:42.291
I was around the corner. You
know I was getting a boob job?

03:42.291 --> 03:44.375
Yeah. I think it's
a fantastic idea.

03:44.375 --> 03:47.208
Really? Why did I want one?
Do you think I need one?

03:47.208 --> 03:50.083
Who cares? I get your
old shirts when they don't fit.

03:50.083 --> 03:52.208
Hey, here,
I'll just ride up with you.

03:52.208 --> 03:54.959
One good thing about
your bonk on the head, huh?

03:54.959 --> 03:57.083
- What?
- Got rid of your
fear of elevators.

03:57.083 --> 03:58.125
Number two.

03:59.083 --> 04:03.625
[Samantha screaming, muffled]

04:05.041 --> 04:08.250
- Yeah. Oh... OK.
- Come on. It's all right.

04:08.250 --> 04:13.000
OK. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. OK.

04:13.000 --> 04:14.417
[sighs]

04:14.417 --> 04:16.000
Yeah, it's cool. It's cool.

04:16.000 --> 04:19.000
That's valuable information.
That's what I wanted.

04:19.000 --> 04:20.375
To find things out,
get back in my life.

04:20.375 --> 04:24.000
I want to too, but don't you
think it's soon to go back
to work?

04:24.000 --> 04:28.125
That's the thing.
I never asked where I work
or what I do for a living.

04:28.125 --> 04:30.792
I mean, so where do I work?
Do you know?

04:30.792 --> 04:32.917
- Hmm.
- [whispers] What? What?

04:34.959 --> 04:37.000
Uh-huh. [gasps]

04:38.417 --> 04:40.959
- That's me?
- Yeah.

04:40.959 --> 04:43.125
I work here! I work here!
This is my office!

04:43.959 --> 04:45.792
Oh...

04:45.792 --> 04:47.125
I'm a vice president?

04:48.917 --> 04:53.000
Ah, sookie sookie. VP! VP!

04:58.125 --> 05:00.875
OK, now we are
getting somewhere. All right.

05:00.875 --> 05:03.417
What do we do? Wait.
You're a lawyer. Am I a lawyer?

05:03.417 --> 05:05.083
Is that hard? That sounds hard.

05:05.083 --> 05:07.417
Time for you to go,
but no more questions.

05:07.417 --> 05:10.417
No one should know about
your little memory problem.

05:10.417 --> 05:13.125
Any sign of weakness
is sniffed out and destroyed.

05:13.125 --> 05:15.166
Where do they think
that I've been?

05:15.166 --> 05:18.625
- I don't know. Maybe rehab.
- You told them I was in rehab?

05:18.625 --> 05:20.959
Rehab is trendy,
it makes you seem young.

05:20.959 --> 05:23.000
OK, but wait a minute.
What do we do here?

05:23.000 --> 05:25.291
Oh, my God!
It's you. Hi. Sorry.

05:25.291 --> 05:26.792
- Your secretary.
- Sorry.

05:26.792 --> 05:29.959
I didn't expect you in today,
but welcome back. Your apple.

05:29.959 --> 05:33.917
- Oh, thank you.
- Forgot to start it
for you. Sorry.

05:35.458 --> 05:37.542
I make her start my apple?

05:37.542 --> 05:40.375
Get out of here before
anyone else knows you're back,

05:40.375 --> 05:41.959
and I'll fill you in later.

05:41.959 --> 05:44.750
- Like what we do.
- Yes. Good morning,
Mr. Chapman.

05:44.750 --> 05:46.959
Have the documents?
Need them before 11:00.

05:46.959 --> 05:49.625
- Right away, sir. Of course.
- Thanks.

05:49.625 --> 05:54.959
- So... back from rehab?
- Oh, yep.

05:54.959 --> 05:58.041
Is that dog hair? Be back
in time for the 11 o'clock.

05:58.041 --> 05:59.750
[sighs] Oh, God.

06:03.125 --> 06:06.959
And I'm a vice president of
something, and I have my own
office,

06:06.959 --> 06:10.125
and I got a big chair and
a coffee cup and a secretary

06:10.125 --> 06:13.625
who's completely afraid of me.
I mean, I am a big damn deal!

06:13.625 --> 06:14.959
Oh! And you know what?

06:14.959 --> 06:16.834
Found out I'm getting
a boob job,

06:16.834 --> 06:18.375
and I'm afraid of elevators.

06:18.375 --> 06:20.417
How was your day?

06:20.417 --> 06:23.250
- I ate a Pop-Tart.
- Sorry to barge in on you.

06:23.250 --> 06:26.041
I need something to wear
to this 11 o'clock something.

06:26.041 --> 06:29.500
I don't mean to make anything
any weirder than they are
between us.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.291
Think my bra's
gonna show through?

06:31.291 --> 06:33.417
You do remember
we broke up, right?

06:33.417 --> 06:35.208
Yeah. Duh!

06:35.208 --> 06:38.083
Yeah, I thought so before,
then back you came.

06:38.083 --> 06:41.917
I know. I'll be out in just
two seconds. Hey, by the way,
what do I do?

06:41.917 --> 06:44.250
- Something at Chapman and Funk.
- Yeah, I know.

06:44.250 --> 06:46.750
- I was at Chapman and Funk.
- Don't get mad at me.

06:46.750 --> 06:49.959
I tried to take interest, but
every time I asked what you did,

06:49.959 --> 06:52.166
you spoke to me slowly
like I was a monkey.

06:52.166 --> 06:54.875
There's no need
to speak slowly to a monkey.

06:55.959 --> 06:57.333
Um...

06:57.333 --> 06:59.125
I know I'm going
to miss the cake.

06:59.125 --> 07:01.041
- Cake?
- Birthday cake.

07:01.041 --> 07:04.250
To save money, you suggested
they ban employee birthdays.

07:04.250 --> 07:06.500
We had a freezer
full of confiscated cakes.

07:06.500 --> 07:10.875
- God. I really hated birthdays.
- Or loved cake.

07:10.875 --> 07:13.959
I got to get to this 11 o'clock,
but I'd love to hear more.

07:13.959 --> 07:16.083
Know what?
I don't mean to complain,

07:16.083 --> 07:19.959
but I just really feel like
I am doing all the work in this
breakup.

07:24.291 --> 07:27.333
Hey, hey, Frank. I'm not really
sure about this outfit.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.583
You know me. Is this me?

07:29.583 --> 07:31.583
- Yes, it is.
- You didn't look.

07:32.959 --> 07:35.250
It's an improvement
over the usual, I'd say.

07:35.250 --> 07:36.917
Really? How?

07:36.917 --> 07:40.250
Coco Chanel said that
to avoid over-accessorizing,

07:40.250 --> 07:43.917
women should look in the mirror
and remove one thing.

07:43.917 --> 07:46.542
With you, it was
often your dignity.

07:46.542 --> 07:49.208
Well, thank you
for your honesty.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.583
Hey, should I get a boob job?

07:51.583 --> 07:53.583
- We are not friends.
- Right.

07:57.875 --> 07:59.417
Twenty floors. [panting]

08:01.959 --> 08:03.208
OK. OK.

08:03.208 --> 08:05.208
Hi. Thank you, secretary.

08:05.208 --> 08:07.959
Listen, I have ten seconds
before this meeting.

08:07.959 --> 08:12.250
Now just don't ask me,
but just tell me: What do we do?

08:12.250 --> 08:15.333
Exactly what we're told.
I know now. Won't happen again.

08:15.333 --> 08:19.333
No. Andrea! Listen, I'm about
to fake my way through this
meeting, OK?

08:19.333 --> 08:21.709
It'd be really nice
if I knew what it is...

08:21.709 --> 08:23.250
It's 11 o'clock, let's do it.

08:23.250 --> 08:25.750
- I just want to do it.
Right now.
- Let's do it.

08:29.375 --> 08:32.125
- No.
- No? No. OK. Oh, I'm sorry.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.667
- Let's get started. Anyone?
- Got us a City Council hearing

08:45.667 --> 08:47.583
- on that church property.
- Anyone?

08:47.583 --> 08:51.500
CRA meeting. Don't want us
turning a retirement home
into condominiums.

08:51.500 --> 08:54.041
- The play? Zoning commission?
- Impact hearing.

08:54.041 --> 08:55.667
Real estate! [laughs]

08:58.959 --> 09:01.667
It's, uh... It's what we do.

09:01.667 --> 09:04.792
Rehab. She's not
used to her own serotonin.

09:04.792 --> 09:07.583
I know what Sam means.
"Real estate: It's what we do."

09:07.583 --> 09:10.959
Get it? Not having meetings,
negotiating, but taking
real estate

09:10.959 --> 09:13.959
and developing it so the city
we love is the best. Am I right?

09:13.959 --> 09:15.542
Oh, yeah, yeah. Very.

09:15.542 --> 09:18.417
- How do we get
rid of the church?
- Don't get rid of a church!

09:18.417 --> 09:21.458
She's right. We add a church.
There's a mini-mall next door.

09:21.458 --> 09:24.750
We buy it, move in a made-up
church, say it wants to expand.

09:24.750 --> 09:28.375
Great idea because the council
can't take sides in a religious
dispute.

09:28.375 --> 09:31.041
- I didn't say to buy a mall.
- We don't need to. I get it.

09:31.041 --> 09:34.709
Lease a storefront, put up
a sign that says Immigration
Department.

09:34.709 --> 09:38.125
- Place empties out,
pick it up for nothing.
- Now we are talking!

09:38.125 --> 09:41.542
I don't know why I'm running
this meeting. Look at Sam.
Check it.

09:41.542 --> 09:45.625
She comes back, she's clean
as a whistle, sharper than ever,
claws out.

09:45.625 --> 09:48.834
Anyone who does not sign up
for rehab is fired.

09:48.834 --> 09:52.750
I need new ideas on my desk by
midnight, maybe we'll sneak out
of here early.

09:52.750 --> 09:54.083
Great meeting.

09:56.250 --> 10:00.375
Well... this job sucks.

10:14.917 --> 10:17.250
Knock-knock!

10:17.250 --> 10:20.750
You know saying "knock-knock"
isn't actually knocking. Right?

10:20.750 --> 10:22.750
- What were you looking at?
- Nothing.

10:22.750 --> 10:24.250
Are you curious about your body?

10:24.250 --> 10:26.500
No, I'm not curious
about my body.

10:26.500 --> 10:29.667
I'm just trying to understand
why I would want a boob job.

10:29.667 --> 10:32.000
- Well, let me see.
- No. God. No.

10:32.000 --> 10:34.792
They're nothing
I haven't seen a thousand times.

10:34.792 --> 10:37.333
I made them, for heaven's sakes.
Come on. Open up.

10:39.333 --> 10:40.667
- Knock-knock.
- Oh!

10:40.667 --> 10:42.750
Oh! Jiminy Christmas!

10:42.750 --> 10:44.333
Um, can you go?
I have to dress.

10:44.333 --> 10:46.375
There's nothing wrong
with your breasts.

10:46.375 --> 10:49.625
They're great. They're gonna
stay great. You have the genes.

10:49.625 --> 10:52.959
- Here, look at these.
- No, stop. Just...

10:52.959 --> 10:55.542
It's not about
if I need a boob job.

10:55.542 --> 10:59.291
It's just about... [groans]
It's just about who I am.

10:59.291 --> 11:04.083
I found out what I do for
a living today, and I really
don't like it.

11:04.083 --> 11:07.000
- So quit.
- I can't quit. And do what?

11:07.000 --> 11:10.875
I don't even know how to do
what it is that I do do.

11:10.875 --> 11:14.000
[Howard] Don't tell her to quit!
How's she gonna get insurance?

11:14.000 --> 11:16.458
Howard, go away!

11:16.458 --> 11:20.125
I know. Tomorrow we'll go
to that new game store Marjorie
Law opened

11:20.125 --> 11:23.959
with money the city gave her
from when the fireworks came
down on her.

11:23.959 --> 11:27.750
It's called I'm Game If You Are.
She's getting a new jigsaw
puzzle.

11:27.750 --> 11:29.959
I don't want to do a puzzle.
I am a puzzle.

11:29.959 --> 11:33.959
When I was a little girl, I
mean, what did I dream of doing?

11:33.959 --> 11:36.333
- Puzzles.
- OK, and we will do puzzles.

11:36.333 --> 11:38.208
I think right now
I should find out

11:38.208 --> 11:40.959
- what it is that I love.
- Not me, that's for sure.

11:40.959 --> 11:42.166
Oh, for God's sakes.

11:42.166 --> 11:44.041
No, you do. You hate me.
It's fine.

11:44.041 --> 11:46.959
We will do puzzles, OK?
It's just...

11:46.959 --> 11:50.000
You're the one who said this
morning that this is a new life.

11:50.000 --> 11:53.583
And maybe I should have
a new life that I want.

11:53.583 --> 11:55.542
Well, maybe you should.
I don't know.

11:55.542 --> 11:57.709
This morning you didn't
have time for me,

11:57.709 --> 12:00.083
'cause you were trying
to find out who you were.

12:00.083 --> 12:03.709
Now you don't have any time
for me, you're trying to
find out who you are.

12:03.709 --> 12:06.959
Well, from where I sit, this
new life looks like the old one,

12:06.959 --> 12:09.000
because neither one includes me.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.959
So have fun tonight
and, uh, wear a short skirt.

12:12.959 --> 12:15.333
It'll take attention away
from your chest.

12:17.625 --> 12:20.000
[samba music playing]

12:24.792 --> 12:26.959
You are my hero.

12:26.959 --> 12:29.792
No, you are. You're really
just going to quit?

12:29.792 --> 12:32.875
- No.
- Maybe. I mean, am I crazy?

12:32.875 --> 12:34.959
- Yes.
- And here you are.

12:34.959 --> 12:37.583
I mean, what would you do,
anyway, if you quit?

12:37.583 --> 12:39.000
She can do whatever she wants.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.959
You could do whatever
you dream of in the whole world.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.959
You could rescue Newfies.
You could...

12:43.959 --> 12:46.166
Oh! Oh, uh...

12:47.041 --> 12:49.667
No, that's all I got. Newfies.

12:49.667 --> 12:52.917
How'd she get in here, really?
Is there no one at the door?

12:52.917 --> 12:56.834
No, no, no. She's right.
I can do whatever I want.

12:56.834 --> 12:59.500
I mean, I can write.
I could paint.

12:59.500 --> 13:02.625
I could open up a cupcake shop
or a coffee shop.

13:02.625 --> 13:05.333
- Or a coffee shop
that has cupcakes.
- That one.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.834
- OK.
- Do that.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.875
The point is, is that
this thing happened to me,

13:09.875 --> 13:13.083
- this near-death experience.
- Oh, my God, when?

13:13.083 --> 13:16.959
- Oh, when I got hit by a car.
- Oh, that. Yeah. OK, go on.

13:16.959 --> 13:21.000
Anyway, if things happen
for a reason, then what was
the reason, right?

13:21.000 --> 13:24.583
Maybe it's that I'm supposed
to do something important
in my life,

13:24.583 --> 13:27.000
like improve the world,
help the little people.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.959
What little people? Dwarves?

13:29.959 --> 13:31.750
The dwarves are fine.

13:31.750 --> 13:34.291
Or maybe just not be unhappy
with what I do.

13:34.291 --> 13:37.959
I mean, come on, Andrea. Do you
really, really love what you do?

13:37.959 --> 13:41.500
I don't know. Who cares?
If everyone asks do they love
what they do,

13:41.500 --> 13:44.959
the economy'll collapse. And
how is that helping the dwarves?

13:46.375 --> 13:48.125
I'm doing it. I'm quitting.

13:48.125 --> 13:52.083
Oh, God, that feels so right.
Don't know why I didn't do this
before.

13:52.083 --> 13:54.834
I'm sorry. I guess your
credit card's declined.

13:56.000 --> 13:59.333
What's that about?

13:59.333 --> 14:03.667
Thirty thousand dollars
in credit card debt? I mean,
how does this happen?

14:03.667 --> 14:05.959
Would it help if I said
you bought me a kidney?

14:05.959 --> 14:10.959
I'll tell you how this happens:
Hair, makeup, nails.

14:10.959 --> 14:14.000
But you know what?
Mostly... shoes.

14:14.000 --> 14:16.083
Oh, my God.

14:16.083 --> 14:19.083
Oh, my God, was I hoarding
shoes? [chuckling]

14:19.083 --> 14:23.000
Was the country converted
to some sort of shoe-based
currency?

14:23.000 --> 14:25.166
I mean, God.
I know what I'm gonna do.

14:25.166 --> 14:28.125
I'll take them all back.
Yep, that's what I'm gonna do.

14:28.125 --> 14:32.041
They have to take them back,
right? Some of these haven't
even been worn.

14:32.041 --> 14:34.125
And then I can
pay off this debt,

14:34.125 --> 14:36.875
and I can quit
that stupid job,

14:36.875 --> 14:39.375
and I can follow my dreams
and help the dwarves.

14:39.375 --> 14:42.000
- What about these?
- Not those. Those are cute.

14:42.000 --> 14:44.041
- Sam...
- No, listen, listen, listen.

14:44.041 --> 14:46.166
I can do this.
I can do this, all right?

14:46.166 --> 14:49.125
Just tell me, where do
I keep the receipts?

14:49.125 --> 14:51.750
You'll find them
in the matching purses.

14:51.750 --> 14:52.959
[groans]

14:56.333 --> 14:58.583
Stupid Old Me.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.959
I mean, Old Me really screwed
New Me over, didn't she?

15:01.959 --> 15:04.875
I mean, how am I supposed
to start fresh when my past

15:04.875 --> 15:08.625
just keeps reaching into
my future and pulling me
into my present?

15:09.417 --> 15:11.000
That's very true.

15:11.000 --> 15:15.875
And now I can't quit my job,
and I have to work.
It is so unfair!

15:15.875 --> 15:18.000
Unfair how?

15:18.000 --> 15:22.125
[sobbing] That I have to work
so I can pay my bills!

15:22.125 --> 15:26.000
So that I can make money!

15:26.000 --> 15:31.125
OK, so it sounded a lot more
unfair in my head than it did
out loud.

15:32.959 --> 15:36.041
- And who are these dwarves?
- Never mind.

15:36.041 --> 15:41.333
Anyway, no. No dwarves,
no writing, no painting,
no cupcakes.

15:42.834 --> 15:45.709
Well, then I guess a boob job's
out of the question.

15:47.333 --> 15:49.542
Ow!

15:49.542 --> 15:52.542
There's more where
that came from, mister.

15:55.792 --> 15:59.667
- Here's my thought.
I think you're gonna like it.
- I think I'm gonna love it.

15:59.667 --> 16:04.000
So, now I haven't gotten
all the details worked out,
but when I, um...

16:04.000 --> 16:08.000
When I was in rehab,
we had these amazing speakers.

16:08.000 --> 16:11.000
And there was this one guy.
He was very, very wealthy.

16:11.000 --> 16:14.291
I can't tell you his name
because the whole anonymous
thing.

16:14.291 --> 16:19.250
But he said that the secret
to success is to do what the
other guys don't.

16:19.250 --> 16:22.959
So instead of getting rid
of that church... Are you ready?

16:23.709 --> 16:25.125
We don't.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.875
Not sure I follow.

16:29.875 --> 16:34.875
What we do is we start to get
the name Chapman and Funk
associated with...

16:34.875 --> 16:37.625
- The poor.
- Yes! Yes, helping the poor.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.750
No, being poor.
Have you lost your mind?

16:39.750 --> 16:42.000
No. Y... Yes. No, listen.

16:42.000 --> 16:46.000
Or what we do is, we don't do
development. We, um, diversify.

16:46.000 --> 16:49.417
Open a bakery because,
you know, people love cupcakes.

16:49.417 --> 16:51.333
Shh. Mm-mm. Listen.

16:51.333 --> 16:55.166
This rehab of yours, I do not
know what they took out of your
system,

16:55.166 --> 16:58.959
but right now I want you
to stand up, I want you
to go back there,

16:58.959 --> 17:01.083
and I want you
to pay whatever it takes

17:01.083 --> 17:03.417
to just shove that crap
back in your mouth.

17:03.417 --> 17:05.458
- OK.
- Good meeting.

17:10.959 --> 17:13.750
- Didn't go so well, huh?
- He's an ass.

17:13.750 --> 17:16.208
So? You used to know
how to play him.

17:16.208 --> 17:19.083
Next time you go in there,
smile, open a button or two,

17:19.083 --> 17:21.458
- and it'll go fine.
- I'm not gonna open...

17:21.458 --> 17:22.875
Oh, my God.

17:25.000 --> 17:28.375
I can't believe you walk up 20
flights of stairs every morning.

17:28.375 --> 17:30.750
- I so admire that.
- Well, it keeps me strong

17:30.750 --> 17:33.709
and two sizes below
my body's natural comfort level.

17:33.709 --> 17:35.959
You should try it.
Do you have the reports?

17:35.959 --> 17:38.250
I need you to start
redoing my new office.

17:38.250 --> 17:42.000
Have the painters come in first
thing so that there are no fumes
tomorrow.

17:42.000 --> 17:44.333
Sleep there tonight
to make sure it's safe.

17:44.333 --> 17:46.959
- Thank you.
- What are you doing
in my office?

17:46.959 --> 17:49.959
Didn't hear? I got it for
landing Sternwood Properties.

17:49.959 --> 17:54.917
Sternwood is mine. How did
you... Oh, you did not.

17:54.917 --> 17:57.375
Chapman didn't fall
for a move that cheap.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.959
Whose idea do you
think these were?

18:07.000 --> 18:10.000
Excuse me. I have to
get something off my chest.

18:10.000 --> 18:11.000
Ooh.

18:12.625 --> 18:14.291
All right, maybe I wasn't clear.

18:14.291 --> 18:17.542
What I meant to say was that
we both know that you have

18:17.542 --> 18:21.458
encouraged and rewarded
at least one woman here
to have her boobs done.

18:21.458 --> 18:26.792
So if you ever talk to any woman
in this company about any body
part ever again,

18:26.792 --> 18:28.875
by the time you
and I are out of court,

18:28.875 --> 18:32.667
this place is going to be called
Chapman, Funk and Newly.

18:32.667 --> 18:38.000
Or just Funk and Newly.
Newly and Funk. Either way.

18:38.000 --> 18:41.750
- Bottom line it for me.
Church stays?
- It's a start.

18:46.500 --> 18:47.917
One more thing.

18:47.917 --> 18:53.625
âª Happy birthday, dear Tracy âª

18:54.834 --> 18:59.625
âª Happy birthday to you âªâª

18:59.625 --> 19:02.041
- Whoo!
- [cheering]

19:02.041 --> 19:03.417
Happy birthday, Trace.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.458
Oh, so you're honestly
telling me

19:05.458 --> 19:08.375
that your secretary's birthday
happens to be today?

19:08.375 --> 19:10.417
No, no, but I had
to send a message.

19:10.417 --> 19:14.500
She was like, "No, I can't do
that." I said, "Look, do I have
to command you

19:14.500 --> 19:18.166
to have a good time?
Eat a piece of cake.
Have two pieces." Poor thing.

19:18.166 --> 19:20.959
- She's diabetic, you know.
- Oh, for heaven's sake.

19:20.959 --> 19:22.959
No, no, spit, spit!

19:37.750 --> 19:39.959
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.

19:41.959 --> 19:44.166
Went back to work, I see.

19:44.166 --> 19:49.166
Yep. I'm a working girl.

19:49.166 --> 19:53.083
I mean, not like a hooker
or something... like that.

19:56.417 --> 19:57.959
[sighs]

19:57.959 --> 20:00.250
- Here's an edge piece.
- Yeah, I saw it.

20:00.250 --> 20:03.166
You know, it doesn't
have to be all work.

20:03.166 --> 20:08.959
I mean, I hear those 80 hour
weeks, they can be hard on other
stuff, too.

20:10.083 --> 20:12.959
Like friends and family.

20:15.917 --> 20:18.000
And it doesn't
have to be forever.

20:18.000 --> 20:20.083
But people work, right?

20:20.083 --> 20:23.000
And I think that I can
do some good over there.

20:24.542 --> 20:28.166
- In a lot of debt, huh?
- Just do the puzzle.

20:28.166 --> 20:32.792
[Samantha] I had this dream,
and I woke up clean and white
as snow,

20:32.792 --> 20:36.166
my debts forgiven,
and my sins all washed away.

20:36.166 --> 20:41.000
That sounds awesome,
but it's a bunch of crap.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.875
I mean, yesterday can't be
unlived, it's part of today.

20:46.875 --> 20:49.166
We drag it along
like a big, old dog.

20:53.625 --> 20:57.000
Today is all we can control.
We do today right...

20:57.000 --> 20:59.959
...we may even have
a shot at tomorrow.

21:01.959 --> 21:04.250
By the way, I'm not going
to get that boob job.

21:04.250 --> 21:05.750
No? Good.

21:07.125 --> 21:10.333
Then you really should
start sleeping in a bra.
