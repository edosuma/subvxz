WEBVTT

00:22.350 --> 00:23.681
[woman] 50, what was it like?

00:25.100 --> 00:27.352
All you ever hear on the news
is just how bad it is,

00:27.440 --> 00:30.227
but_it has t9 _be at_ least
a little eXCItIng, right?

00:31.150 --> 00:33.857
Traveling all across the world
for your country?

00:35.950 --> 00:37.190
I'd sure be excited.

00:39.030 --> 00:42.329
Then again, I've never really
even left Missouri, so...

00:43.040 --> 00:45.827
[sighs] Five more minutes
listening to her,

00:45.920 --> 00:48.127
you're gonna wish you'd died
in a ditch in Hue.

00:48.670 --> 00:49.830
Excuse me.

00:49.920 --> 00:51.160
Oh, you heard me.

00:51.250 --> 00:55.425
Sure, she's pretty and all,
but that's only gonna get you so far.

00:55.510 --> 00:57.216
Now, miss, what gives you
the right to come in here

00:57.300 --> 00:59.461
and insult a respectable young woman?

00:59.550 --> 01:01.552
[chuckles] "Respectable"?
Is that what they say

01:01.640 --> 01:03.676
when they mean more boring
than a church social?

01:03.770 --> 01:04.634
I'm not boring.

01:04.730 --> 01:07.642
Ooh! Anyone tells you they're not boring's
got one foot in the grave.

01:08.190 --> 01:10.727
Or are you telling me
you made it back from 'Nam unscathed

01:10.820 --> 01:12.811
just to come home and run out the clock?

01:15.030 --> 01:18.773
Drop a ten on the table,
follow me out that door,

01:19.700 --> 01:22.362
I promise I'll at least
make it interesting.

01:26.870 --> 01:31.660
And I need you
More than want you

01:32.590 --> 01:37.618
And I want you for all time...

01:40.760 --> 01:43.513
[woman] A gentleman
never lets a lady go in alone.

01:43.600 --> 01:46.171
Miss, what makes you so sure
I'm a gentleman?

01:46.270 --> 01:47.225
I'm Darlene.

01:48.850 --> 01:51.182
Got the feeling
you're all kinds of trouble, Darlene.

01:51.270 --> 01:52.897
Only the best kinds.

01:54.650 --> 01:55.890
[Darlene shouts]

02:16.590 --> 02:17.830
[Darlene] Hold on, baby.

02:19.800 --> 02:23.588
Please, please, please, just hold on.

02:27.600 --> 02:28.680
[rapid gunfire]

02:28.770 --> 02:30.431
Drive, you idiot.

02:31.480 --> 02:32.890
[tires screeching]

02:40.990 --> 02:46.235
Jacob. Oh, God.
Don't you go and die on me, baby.

02:49.500 --> 02:51.821
Oh, God, don't you die on me.

03:14.940 --> 03:15.929
Thank you.

03:16.020 --> 03:19.353
[Wendy inhales, exhales]

03:19.610 --> 03:20.599
What's going on?

03:21.240 --> 03:23.947
-Your sister is upset.
-Upset?

03:24.530 --> 03:25.656
Okay, more than upset.

03:25.740 --> 03:27.947
She doesn't wanna be a member
of this family anymore.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.150
-What are you talking about?
-I'm emancipating.

03:30.250 --> 03:31.456
You are not emancipating.

03:32.790 --> 03:34.030
I don't... I don't understand.

03:34.130 --> 03:36.086
It just means I'll be in charge
of my own decisions.

03:36.170 --> 03:41.335
We are so close to working out
what I admit is a terrible situation.

03:41.420 --> 03:44.173
But right now,
you are being really fucking selfish.

03:45.720 --> 03:47.210
-That's not helpful.
-[scoffs] Well...

03:47.850 --> 03:51.092
-We're gonna get through this, okay?
-Oh, is that a clich or a platitude?

03:51.180 --> 03:52.340
[Wendy] Mmm.

03:52.440 --> 03:54.089
I'm trying to see your side here.

03:58.480 --> 04:01.938
You're scared. You both are.

04:02.990 --> 04:07.108
You know I'm right.
You're scared, and you should be.

04:09.910 --> 04:12.617
So, you understand how this works, right?
That's what you're saying?

04:13.250 --> 04:14.569
That's part of the threat?

04:15.170 --> 04:18.333
So, you're really gonna get a lawyer
who's gonna ask questions?

04:18.420 --> 04:22.538
Who's gonna file papers in court stating
exactly why you wanna be emancipated?

04:26.090 --> 04:28.467
that's gonna keep us
from all being arrested?

04:29.810 --> 04:30.799
Or killed?

04:35.350 --> 04:37.011
Jonah, pass the pancakes.

04:37.940 --> 04:38.759
Now!

04:39.940 --> 04:40.929
Thank you.

04:43.110 --> 04:44.316
[sighs]

04:46.070 --> 04:47.310
[Jacob]
What happened?

04:49.530 --> 04:55.321
[Darlene] The Mexicans tried to kill you,
but God had another plan.

04:57.960 --> 05:03.250
He sent that bullet straight through
your shoulder, clean entry and exit.

05:04.010 --> 05:06.046
Now, you lost a lot of blood,

05:06.130 --> 05:11.215
but you will be out of that bed
and up in a day.

05:13.180 --> 05:14.420
[straining] Where am I?

05:15.520 --> 05:16.976
You're at home.

05:18.230 --> 05:24.237
Hospitals mean police reports,
and police attention limits our options.

05:27.320 --> 05:28.400
[Jacob grunts]

05:31.120 --> 05:33.031
-Darlene.
-What?

05:34.410 --> 05:38.619
Don't you be making
any reckless moves without me.

05:38.710 --> 05:43.830
Don't you worry about me, baby.
You just rest.

05:43.920 --> 05:46.252
If you do anything foolish...

05:46.340 --> 05:48.331
[shushing]

05:49.510 --> 05:53.389
You just worry about
getting your strength back.

05:54.810 --> 05:59.429
I am perfectly capable
of handling the rest.

05:59.520 --> 06:01.010
[breathing heavily]

06:02.020 --> 06:05.353
[hip hop music playing]

06:18.250 --> 06:20.411
Try to at least pretend
like you're a professional.

06:20.500 --> 06:21.660
Yeah, I thought you were off today.

06:21.750 --> 06:23.456
Well, somebody's gotta feed
the fucking animals.

06:23.540 --> 06:25.292
-[man] Everybody on the ground!
-[gunshot]

06:25.380 --> 06:27.007
[all screaming]

06:27.090 --> 06:27.909
[Sam] It's okay. It's okay.

06:28.010 --> 06:31.332
Hey. Hey.
No reason anybody needs to get hurt, okay?

06:31.430 --> 06:33.751
We totally understand
that you have all the power--

06:33.850 --> 06:34.965
-[grunts]
-[a|| scream]

06:35.060 --> 06:36.925
[man] Who's in fucking charge?

06:40.440 --> 06:41.839
[Ruth breathing heavily]

06:42.940 --> 06:43.929
You don't wanna be doing this!

06:44.020 --> 06:46.397
You're next, sweetie.
Don't make this fucking hard.

06:46.480 --> 06:48.732
Move. Anybody moves, you shoot.

06:51.610 --> 06:53.362
[man] Move, girl! I said move.

06:54.200 --> 06:56.191
What the fuck are you doing?

06:58.660 --> 07:00.742
And what are you doing
dragging Wyatt to it? You keep dragging my ass
on a wild-goose chase,

07:03.000 --> 07:04.911
this is what you get. [inhales deeply]

07:06.210 --> 07:08.451
Now, open the goddamn safe.

07:09.260 --> 07:12.172
There's cameras all over the main floor.

07:12.260 --> 07:14.421
You think a mask from the dollar store

07:14.510 --> 07:16.171
is gonna stop the cops
from figuring it out?

07:16.260 --> 07:19.388
I don't give a shit! Now open the safe!

07:21.140 --> 07:22.471
[inhales sharply]

07:24.810 --> 07:26.766
You don't wanna do this, Daddy.

07:26.860 --> 07:28.179
Oh...

07:28.990 --> 07:31.197
I already am, baby girl.

07:33.570 --> 07:35.117
Now, open the safe.

07:41.660 --> 07:44.458
[siren wailing]

07:44.540 --> 07:48.658
[Nix] Okay. So, two men.
One older, one younger.

07:49.420 --> 07:55.757
And the older one, white male, dark eyes,
gravelly voice? You ever seen him before?

07:56.680 --> 07:58.841
No, I-- No, I didn't.

08:01.730 --> 08:03.937
How much money was in the safe,
do you think?

08:04.980 --> 08:07.642
[Ruth scoffs] I don't know.

08:07.730 --> 08:10.483
Fifteen, 20 grand,
or something like that.

08:10.570 --> 08:12.197
Mm-hmm. That normal?

08:12.280 --> 08:16.114
I mean, I didn't deposit it yet.
From the weekend.

08:16.910 --> 08:19.902
[sighs] Is there anyone you might've told
how much was in the safe?

08:19.990 --> 08:23.244
Like, I don't know,
maybe someone out on parole?

08:25.710 --> 08:28.497
Look, I know what you're thinking.

08:29.210 --> 08:31.952
How do you know what I'm thinking
if I'm just now thinking it?

08:32.050 --> 08:34.041
[Marty] You're thinking that
it was an inside job.

08:36.340 --> 08:37.750
Ruth, you know who did this?

08:40.010 --> 08:44.094
No. I swear to fucking God, I don't.

08:45.060 --> 08:47.893
There you go. There you have it.

08:48.940 --> 08:50.225
[Nix sighs]

08:50.980 --> 08:55.394
I'm gonna go talk to some witnesses.
We'll talk again.

09:03.870 --> 09:06.327
I promise,
I didn't know he was gonna do this.

09:07.920 --> 09:11.549
I believe you. Who was that with him?
Was that Wyatt? Hmm?

09:11.630 --> 09:14.121
My dad dragged him into this.
He's not a criminal.

09:14.220 --> 09:17.087
I'll get you your money back,
every fucking penny of this.

09:17.180 --> 09:19.466
-This just can't come out, Marty, okay?
-[cell phone ringing]

09:19.550 --> 09:22.303
Please. You gotta protect him.

09:22.930 --> 09:23.806
Hello.

09:28.150 --> 09:30.766
Jesus Christ. All right.
I'll be right there.

09:31.610 --> 09:32.770
Stick to your story.

09:38.070 --> 09:39.776
[chattering]

09:44.580 --> 09:45.706
[Marty] Hi, there.

09:45.790 --> 09:47.667
Excuse me. You mind telling me
what the hell's going on?

09:47.750 --> 09:49.126
No one goes through.

09:49.210 --> 09:50.120
Right. Well, look.

09:50.210 --> 09:51.666
I got all these workers,
all this equipment.

09:51.750 --> 09:53.160
They should've been on that land
three hours ago.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.502
-We have an access road to build.
-Not my problem.

09:56.090 --> 09:59.048
Okay. You mind radioing Jacob, at least?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.176
Or someone who can tell me
what the fuck IS gorng on?

10:01.260 --> 10:03.467
[Darlene] Jacob is indisposed.

10:03.560 --> 10:04.629
Hey, Darlene.

10:04.720 --> 10:09.089
He's been temporarily laid up
by one of your boss' bullets.

10:11.480 --> 10:12.469
What are you talking about?

10:13.270 --> 10:14.726
Oh, poor thing.

10:15.650 --> 10:18.858
Did they not tell you
that they were gonna try and kill us?

10:21.870 --> 10:22.905
What?

10:23.490 --> 10:26.823
Suffice to say, our little deal is dead.

10:27.410 --> 10:30.538
You best start sniffing elsewhere
for your casino.

10:39.590 --> 10:41.717
[Marty] Since when is it prudent
to try to off your partners

10:41.800 --> 10:43.791
before a deal is even finalized?

10:43.890 --> 10:47.212
I must have missed that issue
of the
Harvard Business Review.

10:47.310 --> 10:50.552
[Helen] I told you, the cartel is gonna do
what the cartel is gonna do.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.550
-[Marty] Right.
-[Helen] Your job was to find a way

10:52.650 --> 10:54.311
to make this deal without the Snells.

10:54.400 --> 10:57.278
I was in the middle of trying
to figure out if that's even possible.

10:57.360 --> 10:58.645
I did not say it was done.

10:58.740 --> 11:00.446
The Snells poisoned my client's product.

11:00.530 --> 11:02.737
My client couldn't allow
such brazen disrespect

11:02.820 --> 11:03.900
without a proportional response.

11:03.990 --> 11:05.730
We completely understand
your client's need for respect.

11:05.830 --> 11:07.149
-Are you fucking kidding me?
-[Wendy] Marty--

11:07.240 --> 11:11.028
I mean, your client's
little ego trip just completely fucked us.

11:11.120 --> 11:13.247
It fucked the casino,
and he pissed away $50 million.

11:13.330 --> 11:15.412
It wasn't my decision.
I wasn't even informed of it.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.546
How do we salvage this?

11:16.630 --> 11:20.009
Find a way to immediately
cut the Snells out of this deal.

11:20.090 --> 11:21.421
We're not salvaging shit.

11:21.510 --> 11:23.080
[Helen] It's the first
law of power, Marty.

11:23.180 --> 11:26.718
Those who can, shit on others.
Those who can't, clean it up.

11:27.520 --> 11:29.340
I'm not playing
your fucking games anymore.

11:29.430 --> 11:31.842
-[Helen] You don't have an option.
-Neither do you.

11:31.940 --> 11:34.306
And neither does your client,
if he wants to keep his $50 million.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.470
You think I'm the only one
over a fucking barrel?

11:36.570 --> 11:37.719
Clean up your own shit.

11:42.740 --> 11:43.729
He'll do it.

11:47.910 --> 11:49.116
[Wyatt] Ruth, I love this sweatshirt--

11:49.200 --> 11:52.533
Just take it off and throw it
in the fucking fire. Now!

11:52.620 --> 11:56.329
If you get popped for armed robbery,
they throw you away for 15 years.

11:56.420 --> 11:57.489
[Three] Nah, more like ten.

11:57.590 --> 12:01.219
Shut up, Three.
And you can fucking forget about college.

12:01.300 --> 12:03.928
I don't see what the big deal is.
They didn't even break and enter.

12:04.010 --> 12:05.921
There were people in a club, Three,

12:06.010 --> 12:08.672
which makes it robbery,
as opposed to burglary.

12:08.760 --> 12:11.172
And Wyatt had a deadly weapon
in his hands.

12:11.980 --> 12:13.720
What the fuck's the matter with you?

12:13.810 --> 12:16.051
Cade said you were in on it.
How am I supposed to know?

12:16.150 --> 12:17.640
[Ruth] And you believed him?

12:19.400 --> 12:21.231
How much money did he give you?

12:21.860 --> 12:22.736
Why?

12:22.820 --> 12:24.447
'Cause I'm giving it back to Marty.

12:25.240 --> 12:28.482
Fuck that.
I'm not giving him a fucking thing.

12:28.580 --> 12:31.037
He just promised not
to rat you out, dipshit.

12:31.120 --> 12:32.610
He just got you back into school.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.860
Yeah, 'cause he feels guilty
about killing my dad.

12:36.380 --> 12:38.371
-He didn't kill your dad.
-You don't know that.

12:38.460 --> 12:40.542
Just shut the fuck up about it, okay?

12:44.430 --> 12:45.966
Just stay away from Cade, all right?

12:46.510 --> 12:48.967
What's he supposed to do?
Uncle Cade lives right there.

12:51.180 --> 12:53.307
What do you think I'm about to say?

12:55.690 --> 12:57.601
[sighs] "Shut up, Three"?

13:01.320 --> 13:03.686
So, how much money'd Cade give you?

13:04.570 --> 13:05.696
Five grand.

13:08.200 --> 13:13.365
Okay. This is where you give it back.
Right now.

13:33.430 --> 13:35.978
-I've got this, okay?
-[door opens]

13:38.310 --> 13:41.859
Mr. and Mrs. Byrde.
I'm Gena Bracken.

13:42.610 --> 13:44.396
I'll be representing Charlotte.

13:45.900 --> 13:47.356
I'm sorry, who are you?

13:47.450 --> 13:50.738
Your daughter's attorney
in her emancipation case.

13:51.660 --> 13:55.653
I've gone to the trouble of drawing up
Charlotte's emancipation papers.

13:56.410 --> 13:58.207
As soon as you and your husband sign them,

13:58.290 --> 14:00.838
Charlotte_will become
an emancrpated mInor.

14:01.500 --> 14:02.956
We can put all this behind us.

14:04.760 --> 14:06.125
Why would we do that?

14:07.260 --> 14:08.079
Well...

14:08.840 --> 14:13.675
Charlotte has painted a picture for me
of a deeply unstable home.

14:14.640 --> 14:21.182
One marred by marital infidelity
and much, much worse.

14:21.270 --> 14:22.680
[Zeke crying]

14:22.770 --> 14:24.852
Jonah, can you go to your room, please?

14:24.940 --> 14:26.680
Jonah already knew.

14:26.780 --> 14:27.815
[Marty] Thank you.

14:29.200 --> 14:34.024
The precise details of my conversation
with Charlotte are protected by privilege.

14:34.120 --> 14:38.238
They will never see the light of day,
if you sign these papers.

14:38.830 --> 14:42.243
Otherwise, we will be forced
to initiate legal proceedings

14:42.330 --> 14:44.161
and her statement goes
into the public record.

14:44.250 --> 14:46.548
Charlotte, do you
really wanna go through with this?

14:46.630 --> 14:48.040
No, have you really thought this through?

14:48.130 --> 14:51.338
Mrs. Byrde, Charlotte has asked
that I speak for her.

14:51.430 --> 14:52.749
Just so we can keep the tone civil--

14:52.850 --> 14:54.886
Oh, I'm sorry.
Are you a member of this family?

14:56.350 --> 14:57.305
No, ma'am.

14:57.390 --> 14:58.766
Then why should I give a fuck
what you think?

14:58.850 --> 14:59.839
Okay, Wendy...

14:59.940 --> 15:02.056
Uh, Charlotte, how about
you and I talk one-on-one?

15:02.150 --> 15:03.686
-No, bravo, Charlotte.
-No lawyers. Just you and me.

15:03.770 --> 15:05.101
-No, bravo.
-Wendy--

15:05.190 --> 15:06.396
You were trying to get our attention.

15:06.480 --> 15:08.641
-Congratulations, because you got it.
-Please... Wendy. Come on.

15:08.740 --> 15:09.559
Charlotte.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.904
Two days. You have two days.

15:19.250 --> 15:21.070
[Zeke continues crying]

15:42.980 --> 15:44.971
[objects clattering]

15:46.190 --> 15:47.396
[car door slams]

15:49.280 --> 15:51.396
Hey! What the fuck are you doing in here?

15:51.490 --> 15:52.946
Where's the fucking money?

15:55.280 --> 15:58.283
Well, I sure as shit
won't be telling you, baby girl.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.706
[cocks gun]

16:04.540 --> 16:06.121
[sighs] Put down the gun, Ruth.

16:09.050 --> 16:12.258
Come on, put it down.

16:14.430 --> 16:16.341
You ain't gonna kill your daddy.

16:19.140 --> 16:20.300
Why not?

16:21.520 --> 16:23.010
You killed yours.

16:24.140 --> 16:25.687
You're not getting my money.

16:25.770 --> 16:29.183
It's not yours,
and I'm giving it back to Marty.

16:29.270 --> 16:31.568
Now, why the fuck would you be doing that?

16:31.650 --> 16:33.606
Because he knows you took it,

16:35.240 --> 16:37.401
and he still vouched for you with Nix.

16:39.160 --> 16:42.903
But if you want,
I can call him up right now and un-vouch.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.149
[inhales sharply]

16:44.250 --> 16:47.879
You know, if I go down,

16:49.040 --> 16:50.587
Wyatt goes down with me.

16:57.510 --> 17:02.971
Wyatt's going to college,
so you can stay the fuck away from him.

17:03.060 --> 17:05.847
You act like he's Albert Einstein
or some shIt.

17:06.480 --> 17:09.643
He's a criminal,
just like you fucking are.

17:11.400 --> 17:12.606
[Cade sighs]

17:14.900 --> 17:15.889
Ruth...

17:18.450 --> 17:21.237
that kid made more money today
than he has his entire life,

17:21.330 --> 17:23.241
and you'd take that away from him?

17:23.950 --> 17:24.860
Hmm?

17:27.750 --> 17:28.705
[Cade] Hmm?

17:30.340 --> 17:31.625
I already did.

17:33.340 --> 17:34.830
And now I'm taking yours.

17:35.760 --> 17:36.966
Mm-hmm.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.505
[grunts]

17:43.520 --> 17:45.590
I thought you were gonna kill me.

17:54.820 --> 17:56.481
[engine turns over]

18:12.380 --> 18:13.540
[Marty] Want some company?

18:17.880 --> 18:18.869
Listen.

18:19.720 --> 18:22.541
We messed up, okay? I messed up.

18:24.930 --> 18:27.672
But we are the only family
that you're ever gonna have.

18:31.310 --> 18:33.687
I'll have my own family one day.

18:43.830 --> 18:44.979
Do you trust me?

18:46.290 --> 18:48.406
Me? Your dad?

18:48.500 --> 18:49.819
Trust you how? To get us out of this.

18:53.460 --> 18:54.996
Please trust me, Charlotte.

18:55.590 --> 19:00.425
It is the one promise that I can make you,
that you can always trust me.

19:01.680 --> 19:05.423
And I am figuring a way out of this.
You know, we're gonna make this right.

19:06.220 --> 19:07.460
[exhales sharply]

19:10.810 --> 19:14.268
Listen, parents are people, Charlotte.
We are... we're flawed.

19:14.360 --> 19:16.100
And I know it's hard
for kids to understand.

19:16.190 --> 19:18.431
-I didn't before I became a parent.
-I'm gonna go now.

19:20.030 --> 19:20.985
Charlotte.

19:24.910 --> 19:27.731
[sighs] Look, I'm not asking you to stay.

19:27.830 --> 19:32.073
I just need you to acknowledge
that you know that I love you.

19:33.420 --> 19:34.739
That's it.

19:35.460 --> 19:38.008
That your mom and I love you
more than anything in the world.

19:38.090 --> 19:39.045
Can you do that?

19:52.770 --> 19:54.226
[Wendy]
How do we fix this?

19:55.190 --> 19:58.227
She knows way too much.
There is no way we can let her emancipate.

19:58.320 --> 20:00.060
She cannot be trusted out there
on her own.

20:00.150 --> 20:03.654
I mean, who knows who she'll talk to?
Who she'll think she can trust?

20:03.740 --> 20:05.981
I mean, God only knows
what that lavwer knows.

20:08.120 --> 20:11.032
She already knows about the affair
and much, much more.

20:11.120 --> 20:13.497
Did you hear how she said that?

20:14.290 --> 20:18.044
Like she's proud to be able to pick
through the sordid details of our lives.

20:20.170 --> 20:21.080
Marty?

20:21.840 --> 20:23.922
Yeah, listen.
There's nothing to fix, okay?

20:24.010 --> 20:27.423
This isn't some political scandal
that you can just paper over

20:27.510 --> 20:30.638
with a press conference
and a halfhearted apology.

20:30.720 --> 20:32.381
This is our family falling apart, Wendy.

20:33.190 --> 20:34.259
-Okay.
-Yeah.

20:34.350 --> 20:35.681
Well, then what do we do?

20:37.400 --> 20:38.810
We said six months.

20:40.610 --> 20:41.645
What if we leave earlier?

20:41.740 --> 20:44.698
_What if we leave the second the casino
IS approved and the cartel leaves town?

20:44.780 --> 20:46.020
-Okay, well, that's insane.
-Why?

20:46.110 --> 20:48.943
Because we don't have the time
or the cash to be able to pull that off.

20:49.700 --> 20:50.985
What if I could go to that lawyer?

20:51.080 --> 20:52.866
I could get her to drop Charlotte
as a client,

20:52.960 --> 20:54.860
or maybe at least I could find out
what Charlotte said to her.

20:54.960 --> 20:57.997
No, that's a terrible idea.
After that little show that you pulled,

20:58.630 --> 21:00.746
she's even more likely
to believe Charlotte.

21:00.840 --> 21:03.331
And if you go see her, you're gonna be
just as angry as you were tonight.

21:04.380 --> 21:06.120
I wasn't angry. I was right.

21:06.220 --> 21:08.347
Do not go see her.
We have enough problems.

21:08.430 --> 21:12.059
Just go talk to Wilkes and see
if he's found a way around the report,

21:12.720 --> 21:15.302
and I'll try to figure out a way
to force Snells' hand.

21:22.030 --> 21:24.487
[woman] Got hard evidence
on that Ozark-Chicago pipeline?

21:24.570 --> 21:26.526
[Petty] Something better: a new strategy.

21:26.610 --> 21:29.158
These photos suggest
the Navarro cartel and the KC mob

21:29.240 --> 21:30.867
might've gone in together in this casino.

21:30.950 --> 21:33.157
[woman] And how's that supposed to lower
my blood pressure?

21:33.250 --> 21:36.117
It gives you the chance
to bring down both at once.

21:38.500 --> 21:41.412
If the gaming commission votes no
on this license,

21:41.500 --> 21:42.956
Byrde's dead to the cartel.

21:43.050 --> 21:46.122
You can swoop in,
offer him a lifeline he can't refuse.

21:46.220 --> 21:48.211
And if the gaming commission votes yes,

21:48.300 --> 21:51.929
the casino has to hire a thousand workers
in a few short weeks.

21:52.760 --> 21:56.059
You can easily slip in a bunch
of undercover agents,

21:56.140 --> 22:00.895
gut the cartel's money-laundering
apparatus and the KC mob at the same time.

22:00.980 --> 22:02.106
This casino...

22:03.440 --> 22:05.237
it can be your Trojan horse.

22:06.070 --> 22:07.059
Mine? Yours.

22:11.200 --> 22:13.236
I just-- I'd like to request a transfer.

22:13.830 --> 22:15.070
Back to Chicago.

22:17.370 --> 22:20.282
I’ve got some personal stuff"
that’s come up.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.745
I need to be closer to home.

22:43.820 --> 22:44.809
Ma.

22:51.820 --> 22:54.527
-Mom? Hey, hey.
-[gasps] Oh!

22:55.410 --> 22:57.446
It's me. Hey. [shushes]

23:00.210 --> 23:02.917
-[crying] Roy, is that really you?
-It's me.

23:04.500 --> 23:05.489
Promise.

23:06.090 --> 23:09.503
[sighs] I missed you, Roy.

23:11.010 --> 23:12.170
[groans]

23:15.470 --> 23:16.459
Well...

23:18.600 --> 23:20.761
you don't have to miss me anymore.

23:23.690 --> 23:26.602
I'm gonna move home full-time.

23:29.030 --> 23:30.691
That sounds wonderful.

23:30.780 --> 23:31.735
So...

23:33.450 --> 23:38.615
you know, maybe you could move in
with me and we could try to...

23:42.670 --> 23:45.207
Yeah. Yeah.

23:46.710 --> 23:47.836
[Barb sniffles]

23:47.920 --> 23:50.047
Okay, so I just... Mom?

23:50.720 --> 23:52.256
-No.
-[grunts]

23:53.430 --> 23:57.173
I just need to go out of town,
get my stuff...

23:58.930 --> 24:00.340
and then I'll come home.

24:01.520 --> 24:06.219
So, I need you to promise me
that you will not go anywhere

24:06.900 --> 24:10.358
-until I get back. Okay?
-[crying] Sure. Yes.

24:10.440 --> 24:12.692
Yes, sweetie, I promise.

24:13.820 --> 24:15.196
I promise.

24:19.910 --> 24:20.899
Okay.

24:22.620 --> 24:25.748
Okay. [sighs]

24:29.380 --> 24:30.586
[elevator bell dings]

24:34.220 --> 24:37.963
[Marty] Hey, excuse me. This photo here,
this was taken before the dam, right?

24:38.560 --> 24:42.599
Yes. And this handsome fella
is my great-grandfather.

24:43.230 --> 24:44.299
-Is that right?
-Yeah.

24:44.390 --> 24:47.143
Okay. Well, then,
your family was flooded out, too, huh?

24:47.230 --> 24:48.436
-Oh, yeah. Yeah.
-Yeah?

24:48.520 --> 24:50.272
You don't seem that upset about it.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.230
Should I be?

24:52.320 --> 24:54.732
Well, a lot of people
are still pretty upset about it.

24:55.780 --> 24:57.987
Yeah, well, the government
just wanted to give them electricity.

24:58.070 --> 24:59.367
Mm-hmm. Yeah, that's true.

24:59.450 --> 25:03.159
Les. Les McAlister. In-house counsel,
Jackson Power District.

25:03.250 --> 25:05.411
-You're Les. Okay. Well, I'm Marty Byrde.
-I am.

25:05.500 --> 25:08.333
I'm your nine o'clock. Thanks for meeting
with me on such short notice.

25:08.420 --> 25:09.830
Oh, the pleasure's all mine.

25:09.920 --> 25:12.252
I expect we'll be doing
quite a bit of business together

25:12.340 --> 25:13.796
if your casino gets approved.

25:13.880 --> 25:17.088
[chuckles] That's the plan.
Yeah, no, we will, for sure.

25:17.180 --> 25:19.421
-Shall we?
-Mm-hmm. Yeah, please.

25:19.510 --> 25:21.842
Um... You know, Les,
what I wanted to ask about

25:21.930 --> 25:23.306
was something
completely different, though.

25:23.390 --> 25:25.847
-It's actually about the dam.
-Mm-hmm.

25:25.940 --> 25:29.103
You know, the size of it
is so impressive, the scale...

25:29.190 --> 25:31.067
It kind of makes you wonder
how they got away with it.

25:31.780 --> 25:32.815
[Les] Got away with what?

25:33.570 --> 25:36.391
[Marty] Moving thousands of people
so quickly.

25:40.370 --> 25:41.359
Charles.

25:42.790 --> 25:43.609
Hey.

25:45.000 --> 25:47.867
All right, so it looks like I managed
to neutralize

25:47.960 --> 25:49.279
Beecher's report to the commission.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.200
Now at least you're
on a level playing field.

25:51.840 --> 25:52.909
How'd you manage that?

25:53.000 --> 25:54.911
He's being investigated for bribery.

25:55.630 --> 25:57.837
And if I had to guess,
your hunch was right.

25:57.930 --> 25:59.716
The FBI was setting you up. And
you leaked that to the commission?

26:03.270 --> 26:06.728
Well, they couldn't turn a blind eye
to corruption, could they?

26:09.270 --> 26:10.476
Thank you.

26:10.560 --> 26:12.608
In the absence of a credible report,

26:12.690 --> 26:14.317
the commissioners will have
some questions.

26:14.400 --> 26:16.231
You and Marty should be prepared
to answer them.

26:16.320 --> 26:17.275
VVhen?

26:18.030 --> 26:21.318
Well, they wanna announce by the weekend,
so later today at five.

26:21.410 --> 26:22.229
-Today?
-Mm-hmm.

26:22.330 --> 26:26.494
They agreed to come here and meet
with all parties involved. Informally.

26:27.210 --> 26:29.166
-[Wendy] So this is our smoke-filled room?
-Yeah.

26:29.250 --> 26:32.162
You wanted me because
people would come to the lake house.

26:32.790 --> 26:35.509
Well, I can get 'em here,
but after that, it's up to you.

26:36.840 --> 26:40.082
Oh. And there's one more thing.

26:41.260 --> 26:42.545
Of course there is.

26:42.640 --> 26:43.629
If all goes well,

26:43.720 --> 26:46.177
the chairman of the gaming commission
will ask something of you.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.635
Something like what?

26:48.730 --> 26:51.346
I have no idea, but it won't be small.

26:51.980 --> 26:55.472
And whatever it is, you need to grant it.
You don't have a choice.

26:59.110 --> 27:00.350
So, extortion.

27:01.200 --> 27:04.988
It's the way they do business.
Like you said, nothing personal.

27:19.470 --> 27:21.040
[door chime jingles]

27:25.970 --> 27:26.800
[Marty] Jacob.

27:35.690 --> 27:37.521
Excuse me if I don't shake your hand.

27:39.030 --> 27:41.021
I'm fine skipping pleasantries.

27:45.160 --> 27:46.866
Let's make this overture brief.

27:47.620 --> 27:52.034
The Almighty himself could not convince us
to lift our blockade.

27:52.120 --> 27:53.747
[Marty] What about the federal government?

27:54.500 --> 27:56.707
You know who I spent the morning with?

27:56.800 --> 27:58.756
Your friends over at the power company.

27:58.840 --> 28:02.833
I wanted to know how it was that
they were able to get your ancestors off

28:02.930 --> 28:06.252
of their land so quickly back in 1929.

28:07.010 --> 28:10.264
No mystery there.
Lies, theft, intimidation.

28:11.140 --> 28:15.099
[Marty] Well, they got an assist from
a little thing called riparian rights.

28:15.190 --> 28:16.350
Pardon me.

28:17.480 --> 28:22.486
Riparian rights are the laws that say
who owns the land under a body of water.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.315
It's kind of crazy, right?

28:25.410 --> 28:29.733
I mean, who ever stops to consider
the land under a lake?

28:30.410 --> 28:33.459
Or, in this case, the Missouri River.

28:34.250 --> 28:37.913
Which last time I checked
was a federal waterway.

28:39.130 --> 28:42.918
What this means, Jacob,
is that the instant you flooded your land

28:43.010 --> 28:44.716
and connected it to the Missouri,

28:45.970 --> 28:50.464
you ceded all of that flooded land
to the US government.

28:50.560 --> 28:54.849
[Helen] Which is how I managed to obtain
this written order

28:54.940 --> 28:57.101
guaranteeing our workers access
to the boat.

28:57.190 --> 29:02.139
Now, if you defy this order,
we can have the US Marshals escort them.

29:05.450 --> 29:10.865
And the land that you need
for access roads and parking lots

29:11.580 --> 29:14.071
to get the people to your precious boat.

29:15.540 --> 29:16.950
We own all of it.

29:18.750 --> 29:22.789
What's to stop us from parking guards
all around the water's edge?

29:24.260 --> 29:25.466
[Marty] Eminent domain.

29:26.380 --> 29:28.792
The feds are gonna giveall
the surrounding land

29:28.890 --> 29:30.096
to our business partners

29:30.180 --> 29:35.766
to build shopping malls and hotels
and, yes, access roads.

29:35.850 --> 29:38.057
Because it's in their financial interest.

29:38.150 --> 29:42.519
The tax revenue from said development
is gonna be massive,

29:42.610 --> 29:44.487
just like it was in 1929.

29:45.950 --> 29:51.115
They own it all. Above, around and below.

30:01.290 --> 30:05.374
There is a sermon to be had here,
but I don't feel much like praying.

30:06.590 --> 30:11.596
If you try to fight this, it will cost you
a lot more than a bullet in the shoulder.

30:12.600 --> 30:15.171
Which is why you asked to meet me alone.

30:16.480 --> 30:20.223
You were afraid Darlene_
wouldn't be qUIte so receptive.

30:31.660 --> 30:33.616
I'll need assurances...

30:36.580 --> 30:38.787
if we're expected to stand down,

30:41.960 --> 30:43.916
that you will never, ever

30:45.510 --> 30:48.297
try and hit me or my wife ever again.

30:50.050 --> 30:53.429
You have them,
so long as you keep Darlene in line.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.099
Jacob...

31:08.860 --> 31:11.863
tell Darlene that the casino profits

31:11.950 --> 31:14.657
are gonna make you richer
than you ever imagined.

31:14.740 --> 31:18.699
That you can use them to buy
twice the land that you have now.

31:20.710 --> 31:23.668
She's the same woman now
as when I married her.

31:25.460 --> 31:29.169
Same woman that slipped into this booth
45 years ago,

31:29.260 --> 31:34.630
took my beating heart in both her hands
and took off quicker than a mare.

31:36.600 --> 31:38.841
Same woman I've been chasing ever since.

31:43.860 --> 31:45.316
They'll kill you, Jacob.

31:49.490 --> 31:50.980
What do you do, Martin,

31:52.780 --> 31:54.987
when the bride who took your breath away

31:57.450 --> 32:02.319
becomes the wife who makes you
hold your breath in terror?

32:20.270 --> 32:21.669
[door chime jingles]

32:41.790 --> 32:42.950
It's from Mizzou.

32:44.580 --> 32:46.411
[exhales]

32:47.920 --> 32:48.875
I know it's...

32:50.340 --> 32:54.049
it's fucking skinny,
and maybe it's a no, but...

32:55.130 --> 32:57.098
I also want you to know

32:57.180 --> 33:00.468
that there's a buttload
of other colleges out there.

33:06.400 --> 33:08.015
[breathes deeply]

33:15.990 --> 33:18.618
Okay, can you do it? I can't.

33:20.450 --> 33:21.610
[sniffles]

33:32.010 --> 33:33.375
[clears throat]

33:36.130 --> 33:37.427
"Dear Wyatt Langmore,

33:38.510 --> 33:40.671
I am delighted to inform you

33:40.760 --> 33:45.015
that the University of Missouri
Committee on Admissions

33:45.100 --> 33:49.355
has accepted you into the class of 2022."

33:51.110 --> 33:52.225
[sobs]

33:52.320 --> 33:53.730
[chuckles]

33:55.110 --> 33:56.395
[mumbling]

34:02.540 --> 34:04.030
"Just wanted to let you know
that your essay

34:04.120 --> 34:06.577
was among the most inspiring
we've seen all year."

34:08.170 --> 34:09.706
[both chuckle]

34:12.380 --> 34:14.166
Maybe it can wait a year.

34:16.920 --> 34:18.330
[inhales] What? Why?

34:21.640 --> 34:23.346
I can't leave Three.

34:24.640 --> 34:27.768
Three will be fine.
I'll take care of him.

34:32.020 --> 34:33.260
I don't know, Ruth.

34:34.440 --> 34:35.520
What's not to know?

34:35.610 --> 34:37.350
This is everything
YOU've been working for--

34:37.450 --> 34:40.021
I know. I just feel stuck, okay?

34:40.110 --> 34:44.979
Okay, so get the fuck unstuck.
There's no curse, Wyatt.

34:46.330 --> 34:49.993
I need to understand
what happened to my dad, okay?

34:50.080 --> 34:54.198
Was it an accident? Was he murdered?
Then what the fuck happened?

35:09.020 --> 35:10.339
[door shuts]

35:10.440 --> 35:13.307
What deals did you just make
behind my back?

35:16.440 --> 35:20.353
Only the ones to protect your life.

35:21.780 --> 35:24.613
I've been doing just fine with that
on my own.

35:24.700 --> 35:26.031
Yes, well... [grunts]

35:30.210 --> 35:33.031
I think my right arm might beg to differ.

35:33.790 --> 35:36.998
I told you, God has bigger plans.

35:41.090 --> 35:42.830
We're beat, Darlene.

35:45.600 --> 35:49.388
We were beat
the second we flooded that land.

35:54.230 --> 35:58.644
Land now owned by US government.

35:58.730 --> 36:01.528
The second you flooded that land.

36:01.610 --> 36:06.479
I told you, we should never have
shaken hands with those Mexicans.

36:09.450 --> 36:10.781
And you were right.

36:12.790 --> 36:15.167
You were right. But, right now,

36:17.380 --> 36:20.042
they don't need us alive for their casino.

36:21.550 --> 36:28.058
So the only thing keeping us that way
is my promise that we'll stand down.

36:29.220 --> 36:34.510
Until no one's looking,
then they'll go ahead and kill us anyway.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.760
No, Darlene.

36:36.860 --> 36:41.354
They just wanna keep us
smiling and happy and stupid

36:41.440 --> 36:43.271
until their casino comes through.

36:43.360 --> 36:44.486
You don't know that.

36:44.570 --> 36:45.867
It's what I'd do.

36:47.620 --> 36:50.999
They'll want one of our heads
as a price for those poisoned drugs

36:51.080 --> 36:52.206
and you know it.

36:52.290 --> 36:54.918
Is that why you met with them alone?

36:55.000 --> 36:58.538
I met with them alone _
because the last tIme you undermined me,

36:58.630 --> 37:00.086
it nearly got me killed.

37:02.050 --> 37:04.041
Just like you killed Ash.

37:04.130 --> 37:06.257
Your temper killed Ash.

37:09.220 --> 37:14.340
It's like it's killing everything
we spent our lives working for.

37:16.900 --> 37:22.315
But I swear, Darlene, if you ever
even think to undermine me again...

37:25.820 --> 37:26.775
What?

37:29.910 --> 37:31.195
Tell me, Jacob.

37:33.000 --> 37:37.949
What the fuck happens if I undermine you?

37:39.790 --> 37:41.667
Don't push me, Darlene. It will not end well for you.

37:56.730 --> 37:57.845
[door closes]

38:05.360 --> 38:06.600
Ms. Bracken?

38:10.280 --> 38:11.235
Oh, hi.

38:11.950 --> 38:14.828
-I'm sorry if I'm disturbing you.
-No, no. Not at all.

38:14.910 --> 38:17.663
Family law is about
attending to people's feelings,

38:17.750 --> 38:21.242
and feelings never follow rules
or wait for appointments.

38:22.090 --> 38:24.547
Especially when those feelings
come from a teenager. [chuckles]

38:24.630 --> 38:26.291
Or their parents. [chuckles]

38:28.760 --> 38:33.595
I wanted to apologize
for my reaction yesterday.

38:35.810 --> 38:38.051
And offer a little context. Um...

38:38.140 --> 38:42.144
I'm sure that Charlotte has mentioned
to you our move from Chicago.

38:42.230 --> 38:46.189
And she's taken it harder than my husband
and I could've ever anticipated.

38:47.070 --> 38:49.482
I'm sure you understand
how difficult it is to...

38:50.570 --> 38:53.733
to watch a bright,
promising child struggle.

38:53.830 --> 38:56.037
And even how more difficult it is to admit

38:56.120 --> 38:59.362
that you don't always know how
to respond to that. So...

39:01.460 --> 39:05.794
I'm genuinely sorry
for my reaction yesterday,

39:06.800 --> 39:08.711
and for how much of your time
we've wasted.

39:08.800 --> 39:10.756
I just want you to know
that my husband and I

39:10.840 --> 39:12.296
are willing to pay your hourly rate--

39:12.390 --> 39:16.053
I've been doing this
for a very long time, Mrs. Byrde.

39:16.810 --> 39:19.938
Long enough to see scores of teenagers
come through here,

39:20.020 --> 39:23.808
asking for their emancipation because
mommy and daddy took away their car keys

39:23.900 --> 39:26.277
-and their cell phones.
-[chuckles] I can imagine.

39:26.360 --> 39:28.851
Charlotte is not one of them.

39:29.740 --> 39:31.480
She is terrified of
the person she'll become

39:31.570 --> 39:33.526
if she has to stay in that house.

39:33.620 --> 39:37.033
It is clear to me that she's responding
to something extremely...

39:38.830 --> 39:40.821
troubling at home.

39:41.500 --> 39:45.459
But I just don't have any idea
what she's talking about.

39:46.880 --> 39:52.295
If you could shed just some light
on what she has said, then I don't know.

39:52.390 --> 39:56.178
Maybe I could offer a little perspective,
or at least understand why she's so upset.

39:56.260 --> 39:59.889
I can't reveal any more of the specifics.

40:00.520 --> 40:02.135
And I hope I never have to,

40:03.310 --> 40:06.518
because you and your husband
signed those papers without a fight.

40:17.160 --> 40:21.199
You know, the kind of people who do
the troubling things you think we're doing

40:21.290 --> 40:24.168
are the kind of people who will do
anything to protect their children.

40:26.090 --> 40:29.548
Judges don't look kindly
on people who threaten lavwers.

40:29.630 --> 40:31.120
Oh, no, no, no, no.

40:32.010 --> 40:34.888
I'm just saying,
I'll do anything to protect my daughter.

40:35.800 --> 40:38.507
And I know she's safest at home,
with her family.

41:03.460 --> 41:06.532
-Sheriff.
-Cade. Whatcha doing?

41:07.130 --> 41:10.668
Swapping out the thermostat and plugs
on this engine,

41:10.750 --> 41:12.251
which I pulled off that skiff.

41:12.970 --> 41:15.370
Mm-hmm. Who owns the skiff?

41:17.720 --> 41:19.256
That's above my pay grade.

41:22.140 --> 41:25.348
You know, boats have been going missing
since about the time you got paroled.

41:26.810 --> 41:28.971
Uh-huh. Well...

41:30.270 --> 41:32.989
I don't wanna tell you your job, Sheriff,

41:34.320 --> 41:36.606
but it looks like it could be coincidence.

41:38.450 --> 41:40.577
You're selling stolen boat parts.

41:40.660 --> 41:42.400
And you robbed the strip club.

41:42.500 --> 41:44.570
Hit that guy in the head
with the butt of your gun,

41:44.660 --> 41:46.070
sent him to the hospital.

41:47.170 --> 41:48.376
That's what I'm thinking.

41:49.000 --> 41:49.910
You know...

41:51.800 --> 41:55.839
if thinking were a cupcake,
I'd eat that shit.

41:57.010 --> 41:59.251
I was you, I'd be looking over
my shoulder, brother.

42:00.180 --> 42:02.000
Because I will catch you in the act

42:02.720 --> 42:04.597
and I will send you back to prison.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.305
You understand me?

42:09.020 --> 42:10.180
[grunts]

42:12.320 --> 42:13.309
Good luck with that.

42:21.450 --> 42:24.328
[man] Well, you gotta put yourself
in the commission's shoes, Mr. Byrde.

42:24.410 --> 42:28.164
You own four small businesses,
and you wanna open a casino.

42:28.250 --> 42:29.410
With two partners.

42:30.000 --> 42:32.241
One of whom isn't even based
in this country.

42:33.210 --> 42:34.620
[scoffs] You gotta imagine,

42:34.710 --> 42:38.259
we're normally inclined
to grant licenses to native Missourians.

42:38.340 --> 42:39.716
Of course. Jacob.

42:40.180 --> 42:42.592
Um... as you should.

42:42.680 --> 42:44.887
It's why it was so important
for my wife and I

42:44.970 --> 42:48.269
to partner with Jacob
and his wife Darlene.

42:48.350 --> 42:52.309
The Snell family has been on this land
since before there was even a lake, right?

42:52.400 --> 42:53.685
That's right. That's right.

42:53.770 --> 42:57.433
There's more Snell blood in that land
than any other family in Missouri.

42:57.530 --> 42:58.440
[man] Jacob.

42:59.490 --> 43:01.310
I see you're still
working the farm every day.

43:02.030 --> 43:05.238
Yeah, well, hazard of the job, I guess.
Still, it keeps you young.

43:05.330 --> 43:06.285
[man] Yep.

43:11.290 --> 43:13.497
You over here pulling strings?

43:14.460 --> 43:16.758
Watching people's mouths flap?

43:18.130 --> 43:22.385
Hey, tell me. Once the casino's open,

43:22.470 --> 43:25.382
how long before you try
to take us out again?

43:25.470 --> 43:28.052
You won't be touched.
I gave your husband my word.

43:28.140 --> 43:29.767
[scoffs] What's that worth?

43:31.650 --> 43:34.767
You know, you'll catch more flies
with honey than with vinegar.

43:35.270 --> 43:38.569
Mmm! What do I catch with tar?

43:38.650 --> 43:39.639
Excuse me.

43:41.910 --> 43:43.775
Speak to me kind/y

43:43.870 --> 43:47.158
I’m the type of girl you call wifey

43:47.700 --> 43:48.610
Yeah

43:49.160 --> 43:50.821
I ain ’t no side piece

43:52.790 --> 43:54.166
[Jonah] Can you turn down the music?

43:54.840 --> 43:56.876
I'm gonna put the baby down for a nap.

44:00.800 --> 44:02.290
[volume lowers]

44:05.300 --> 44:07.052
I think what you're doing is wrong.

44:10.100 --> 44:14.093
How do you think this ends?
Happily ever after?

44:14.190 --> 44:15.726
No, but they're getting
the casino approved.

44:15.810 --> 44:18.187
-That was the plan.
-We're bad guys.

44:18.280 --> 44:21.067
I mean, we're criminals.
You see that, don't you?

44:22.150 --> 44:24.732
You almost killed someone,
and Mom asked you to do it,

44:24.820 --> 44:26.651
and you're not even freaked out about it?

44:26.740 --> 44:28.196
That's what freaks me out.

44:29.410 --> 44:30.650
[sighs]

44:35.420 --> 44:36.830
[Zeke cooing]

44:39.670 --> 44:40.750
I'm sorry.

44:42.590 --> 44:44.831
Yeah, well, you didn't have to tell
that lawyer about the affair.

44:44.930 --> 44:46.090
-Jonah...
-[Zeke crying] [Marty] How we looking?

44:52.480 --> 44:55.597
There's one definite no. [sighs]
There's two that are leaning our way

44:55.690 --> 44:56.850
and two that are still on the fence.

44:56.940 --> 44:58.760
-Mm-hmm. Could I have a water, please?
-Sure.

44:59.320 --> 45:02.949
Do you think that Wilkes
will be able to sway the undecideds?

45:03.030 --> 45:04.566
Honestly? I think he's still figuring out

45:04.660 --> 45:07.447
if he's gonna save his own ass
or take us down with him.

45:14.210 --> 45:15.199
IfI may. Pardon me.

45:20.380 --> 45:21.699
Is she staying in line?

45:27.390 --> 45:30.211
Why don't you just worry
about your own business?

45:30.310 --> 45:31.208
Iam.

45:32.680 --> 45:34.682
But if you don't keep up
your end of the bargain,

45:34.770 --> 45:36.055
I can't keep up mine.

45:51.660 --> 45:53.992
Don't look now,
but I think here comes our ask.

45:55.710 --> 45:58.201
-Mr. and Mrs. Byrde.
-[Marty] Commissioner Hodges.

45:58.290 --> 46:00.281
I must say,
you've made quite the impression.

46:00.880 --> 46:04.008
The fact that you succeeded in overturning
the casino cap in the first place,

46:04.090 --> 46:07.833
well, that in and of itself
is an accomplishment.

46:07.930 --> 46:09.170
Well, obviously, from our end,

46:09.260 --> 46:11.751
we'd hate to think
that we lifted the cap in vain.

46:11.850 --> 46:14.671
-[Wendy and Hodges chuckle]
-I believe in being direct.

46:14.770 --> 46:16.010
Please do.

46:16.100 --> 46:20.719
I believe I could assuage
the other commissioners' fears

46:21.770 --> 46:23.522
ifI had certain assurances.

46:24.690 --> 46:26.396
What kind of assurances?

46:27.950 --> 46:30.111
What's your relationship
with Frank Cosgrove?

46:32.280 --> 46:35.943
Uh, his company is gonna be involved
in some of the construction.

46:36.500 --> 46:38.365
Because there's obviously concerns

46:38.460 --> 46:41.839
about organized crime
infiltrating the gaming industry.

46:41.920 --> 46:45.208
Commissioner, I can promise you
that he is not going to be involved

46:45.300 --> 46:48.007
with the business outside
of the initial construction.

46:48.090 --> 46:49.500
I'd be happy to put that in writing.

46:50.470 --> 46:54.008
Keeping Missouri a right-to-work state
is a priority for me.

46:54.970 --> 46:56.301
Please, be direct.

46:58.480 --> 47:00.300
The casino can't be a union shop.

47:01.310 --> 47:02.641
Under any circumstances.

47:10.570 --> 47:11.650
Um...

47:12.620 --> 47:16.078
Then it won't be. You have my word.

47:17.540 --> 47:20.077
Great. Thank you.

47:31.130 --> 47:33.849
Did we just betray the Kansas City mafia?

47:47.070 --> 47:48.776
[Charlotte exhales sharply]

47:51.820 --> 47:53.481
[Marty]
What the hell do you think you're doing?

47:54.370 --> 47:55.610
You want a hit?

47:58.750 --> 48:00.115
Suit yourself.

48:00.620 --> 48:01.666
Where's your brother?

48:02.460 --> 48:04.701
I don't know.
Probably laundering money in his room.

48:04.790 --> 48:05.700
Put that out!

48:11.050 --> 48:13.041
Why should I even pretend
to not break the law

48:13.140 --> 48:14.630
when no one else does?

48:15.430 --> 48:17.307
You know Wendy here
threatened my lavwer today?

48:17.390 --> 48:20.018
-That is not what happened.
-Oh, that's what she told me.

48:20.100 --> 48:21.306
Yes, I went to her,

48:21.390 --> 48:23.688
because I wanted to understand
why you were so upset.

48:23.770 --> 48:25.931
-You went to her?
-Like it's some big fucking mystery?

48:26.020 --> 48:28.352
I said I would do anything in the world
for you because I loved you.

48:28.440 --> 48:29.930
Now, clearly, she has taken that,

48:30.030 --> 48:32.567
she's twisted it and made it sound like
some sort of a threat.

48:32.650 --> 48:35.062
Because you know what, Charlotte?
Lawyers are dishonest. You know who's dishonest? Drug lords.

48:37.660 --> 48:40.151
Okay, let's all just calm down
for a second, okay?

48:40.250 --> 48:41.285
[Charlotte] Why?

48:41.370 --> 48:44.453
So you can emotionally blackmail me

48:44.540 --> 48:47.168
with this bullshit about
how you're trying so hard to fix this?

48:47.250 --> 48:48.877
Do not disrespect your father.

48:48.960 --> 48:51.201
He's not my father,
and you're not my mother.

48:51.300 --> 48:52.119
Charlotte!

48:52.220 --> 48:53.619
[Charlotte] And as far as I'm concerned,

48:53.720 --> 48:56.632
the two of you can both dissolve
in a fucking vat of acid.

48:58.390 --> 48:59.505
[scoffs]

49:02.100 --> 49:02.976
Fine.

49:04.900 --> 49:06.049
Fine.

49:06.810 --> 49:10.029
You wanna emancipate? Fine.
You emancipate.

49:16.320 --> 49:18.823
You wanna go, Charlotte? Go!

49:18.910 --> 49:21.071
You be my guest!

49:23.620 --> 49:25.167
Just go!

49:32.800 --> 49:33.915
[door shuts]

49:35.130 --> 49:36.961
[breathing heavily]

49:40.810 --> 49:42.175
[Marty] Why did you talk to her lawyer?

49:42.270 --> 49:44.226
I told you that would make things worse,
didn't I?

49:44.310 --> 49:46.187
Somebody had to do something.

49:47.310 --> 49:49.767
We can't just cross our fingers
and wish it away.

49:49.860 --> 49:51.600
I did do something. I talked to her.

49:51.690 --> 49:53.988
Oh! Well, clearly it did
a whole lot of good. Because you undermined me, Wendy.

50:04.040 --> 50:05.951
Why are you taking her side?

50:07.460 --> 50:09.917
Because she's right.
We're not fit to be parents.

50:11.210 --> 50:12.586
It's not even a family.

50:13.630 --> 50:15.336
It's a goddamn group of criminals.

50:16.220 --> 50:17.369
[door shuts]

50:18.180 --> 50:19.420
God.

50:22.890 --> 50:24.460
God damn it!

50:26.100 --> 50:28.591
God damn it!

50:39.450 --> 50:41.987
Nix thinks I fucking robbed
the strip club.

50:42.080 --> 50:42.978
You did.

50:43.080 --> 50:45.651
You hold on, girl. What'd you say to him?

50:45.750 --> 50:46.956
Nothing. Fuck off.

50:47.040 --> 50:49.998
Why don't you tell Nix
a couple of Mexicans did it, huh?

50:50.080 --> 50:53.049
You really think that's a good idea?
To go to the sheriff and say,

50:53.130 --> 50:56.167
"Hey, you know what? Now I remember.
It was a couple of Mexicans."

50:56.260 --> 51:00.333
Maybe I'll go to that fucking fed, Petty,
and drop a dime on all your asses. Hmm?

51:00.430 --> 51:02.751
You're putting this on me? Hmm?

51:03.350 --> 51:05.966
'Cause last I checked,
I didn't rob anybody.

51:06.060 --> 51:07.766
I didn't violate parole.

51:07.850 --> 51:09.386
I'm your fucking father.

51:09.480 --> 51:13.974
-Now, you will fucking get me out--
-Or what? Or you'll kill me?

51:27.870 --> 51:29.280
I'm sorry.

51:33.960 --> 51:36.087
Sorry to bother you so late.
I can't find Charlotte.

51:37.210 --> 51:39.417
She left in her van with Wyatt.

51:40.800 --> 51:41.676
Van? What van?

51:41.760 --> 51:44.422
The one she bought with her own money.

51:46.970 --> 51:48.221
Do you know where they went?

51:48.310 --> 51:50.266
[Ruth] All I know is that
they're not here.

52:04.450 --> 52:05.860
[engine turns over]

52:11.670 --> 52:14.457
[Marty] Yes, four of us,
going from Sunrise Beach

52:14.540 --> 52:16.997
to a location near Little Rock, Arkansas.

52:20.050 --> 52:21.256
That's right, one way.

52:22.510 --> 52:23.795
[beeps]

52:24.890 --> 52:27.802
Uh, sir, can I call you right back,
please? Thank you.

52:29.810 --> 52:31.721
-Hi.
-[ Wendy sighs]
I found her.

52:31.810 --> 52:34.017
She’s with Wyatt; in a van.

52:35.810 --> 52:38.108
A van? Whose van?

52:38.820 --> 52:40.776
I don't know. I think hers.

52:41.650 --> 52:43.527
I'm gonna wait here until she comes out.

52:44.070 --> 52:46.118
-Be nice to her, okay?
-Yeah.

52:53.540 --> 52:56.373
-Is Mom okay?
-Yeah. She found Charlotte.

52:57.290 --> 52:59.292
I'm not so sure she wanted to be found.

53:12.180 --> 53:15.479
What were you and the lawyer
whispering about at that party?

53:16.940 --> 53:20.148
Eh... Just small talk. Playing nice.

53:23.360 --> 53:26.193
Figured we might go for a walk
before breakfast.

53:26.780 --> 53:27.940
This early?

53:29.740 --> 53:33.039
Workers start building that road today.

53:36.710 --> 53:40.339
Don't you think we ought
to see the land one last time?

53:41.380 --> 53:43.166
While it's still unspoiled?

53:59.230 --> 54:01.061
Let's take the long ways.

54:03.400 --> 54:05.482
Drink it all in before it's gone.

55:10.550 --> 55:12.381
[cell phone vibrating]

55:18.940 --> 55:19.804
Hello.

55:19.890 --> 55:21.938
[VI/likes]
You got it; Wendy. You won.

55:22.020 --> 55:25.808
Barring any fuck-ups, the commission ’5
gonna grant your license in 48 hours.

55:26.860 --> 55:27.895
Oh. [chuckles]

55:27.990 --> 55:29.389
I don ’t know how the fuck you do it;

55:29.490 --> 55:31.981
but you always manage
to get what you want; don’t you?

55:32.070 --> 55:33.367
[line clicks]

56:08.070 --> 56:11.562
Petty. You're that fed, ain't you?

56:13.570 --> 56:15.947
I wanna talk to you about Marty Byrde.

56:35.930 --> 56:36.919
What is it?

56:39.310 --> 56:40.720
It's a badger, looks like.

56:41.480 --> 56:42.549
[Jacob] Hmm.

56:43.140 --> 56:44.266
Best leave it.

56:45.230 --> 56:48.188
His family will find it
and drag it back to the den.

56:48.900 --> 56:52.609
Pups will feed on the worms
and eat the corpse.

56:54.530 --> 56:56.407
That way its death has meaning.

56:57.330 --> 56:59.321
Brings nourishment to the family.

57:39.450 --> 57:40.610
[knock on door]

57:46.250 --> 57:48.582
I'm gonna need you
to take over the whole operation.

57:50.090 --> 57:53.378
The second the casino is approved,
I'm getting my family out of here.

57:56.340 --> 57:58.547
And if you can run things by yourself,

57:59.430 --> 58:02.137
we'll be long gone
before the cartel knows we've left.

58:02.220 --> 58:03.346
With me out of the picture,

58:03.430 --> 58:06.479
they'll have no choice
but to hand everything to you.

58:09.940 --> 58:12.568
But if this is gonna work,
no one can know.

58:12.650 --> 58:14.277
Not the kids, not Wendy.

59:12.500 --> 59:13.797
[Jacob grunting]

59:16.800 --> 59:20.258
Shh. It'll be quick. I promise.

59:24.010 --> 59:28.049
Cyanide in your coffee,
from ground-up cherry pits.

59:29.980 --> 59:32.141
[both chuckle]

59:34.980 --> 59:37.778
[straining] I never could keep up
with you, Darlene.

59:39.700 --> 59:42.737
It's okay, baby. Just rest.

59:43.830 --> 59:44.979
[kisses]

59:47.540 --> 59:48.825
I love you, Jacob.

59:51.080 --> 59:52.411
You just rest.

59:53.170 --> 59:55.456
I'll make sure it means something.

1:00:18.820 --> 1:00:23.655
I am a lineman for the county

1:00:24.780 --> 1:00:28.819
And I drive the main roads

1:00:29.830 --> 1:00:36.622
Searching in the sun
For another overload

1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:43.538
I hear you sing/n ’in the wire

1:00:44.840 --> 1:00:49.265
I can hear you through the whine

1:00:50.730 --> 1:00:55.019
And the Wichita lineman

1:00:56.560 --> 1:01:01.816
Is 5177/ on the line

1:01:07.410 --> 1:01:12.655
I know I need a small vacation

1:01:13.620 --> 1:01:17.624
But it don ’t look l/ke rain

1:01:18.170 --> 1:01:20.957
And if it snows
That stretch down south

1:01:21.050 --> 1:01:25.919
Won ’t ever stand the strain

1:01:27.430 --> 1:01:31.844
And I need you more than want you

1:01:33.310 --> 1:01:37.849
And I want you for all t/me

1:01:39.270 --> 1:01:43.354
And the Wichita lineman

1:01:44.950 --> 1:01:50.946
Is 5177/ on the line

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:19.649
And I need you more than want you

1:02:21.190 --> 1:02:26.059
And I want you for all t/me

1:02:27.240 --> 1:02:31.074
And the Wichita lineman
