(WHISTLES) We got some straight-up freaks
coming through this place.

16:55.682 --> 16:58.435
Are you the one looking for the samurai?

16:58.977 --> 16:59.978
Yes.

17:00.395 --> 17:02.022
Are you his friend?

17:04.775 --> 17:05.901
Yes.

17:05.984 --> 17:08.153
Follow the path north.

17:11.281 --> 17:12.407
Who?

17:18.997 --> 17:21.416
(BIRD CAWING)
(INSECTS CHITTERING)

17:35.264 --> 17:36.306
(GASPS)

17:36.390 --> 17:37.766
(EERIE MUSIC PLAYING)

17:51.071 --> 17:52.197
(GASPS)

17:54.408 --> 17:55.450
Samurai

17:58.036 --> 17:59.162
Jack?

17:59.246 --> 18:00.497
(HORSE WHINNIES)

18:13.802 --> 18:17.848
You may witness,
but you cannot proceed any further.

18:18.098 --> 18:19.808
Witness what?

18:19.891 --> 18:20.934
The end.

18:21.226 --> 18:23.604
(DRAMATIC MUSIC PLAYING)

18:33.155 --> 18:36.825
Great warriors of past, I welcome you.

18:37.451 --> 18:43.624
This samurai has failed his purpose
and has accepted his fate.

19:03.435 --> 19:04.686
Stop!

19:06.229 --> 19:07.230
(GRUNTS)

19:07.314 --> 19:09.274
This does not concern you.

19:09.900 --> 19:11.818
There is no hope.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.905
ASHI: No! (GROANS)

19:14.988 --> 19:17.324
Hope lives. It is everywhere.

19:17.616 --> 19:21.912
I've seen it, everyone you have touched,
the people you have helped.

19:21.995 --> 19:23.330
You saved them!

19:23.664 --> 19:25.290
Enough! (GRUNTS)

19:38.345 --> 19:40.931
Hope is just a fleeting sentiment.

19:41.306 --> 19:43.892
Your failure is real.

19:44.351 --> 19:48.647
You must face the consequences
or continue to bear the guilt

19:48.855 --> 19:52.317
of your dishonor for all eternity.

19:54.486 --> 19:57.447
(GRUNTS) Jack, don't listen!

19:57.531 --> 19:58.657
You're being misguided!

19:59.533 --> 20:03.036
I've seen it.
You've saved countless innocents.

20:03.620 --> 20:04.746
And most of all...

20:04.830 --> 20:05.872
(GRUNTS)

20:06.873 --> 20:08.709
...you showed me the truth!

20:12.003 --> 20:13.213
(GRUNTS)

20:13.630 --> 20:16.007
You made me see
that there's so much more to me

20:16.091 --> 20:17.592
than I knew existed.

20:19.052 --> 20:21.930
You made me way more than what I was.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.765
(GROANS)

20:29.104 --> 20:32.274
The hope you gave me saved my life!

20:33.608 --> 20:34.693
(GRUNTS)

20:34.943 --> 20:41.283
Death follows in your wake,
men, women, children.

20:43.618 --> 20:44.953
Yes.

20:45.370 --> 20:48.749
All those children dead because of you.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.503
No! The children, they're alive!

20:53.795 --> 20:55.088
You saved them!

20:58.550 --> 21:00.844
No more words!

21:02.679 --> 21:03.889
(CLANGING)

21:04.806 --> 21:06.558
(UPBEAT MUSIC PLAYING)

21:40.884 --> 21:42.219
I, uh...

21:42.302 --> 21:43.428
I like your hair.

21:44.054 --> 21:45.138
And dress.

21:48.475 --> 21:49.810
What now?

21:51.478 --> 21:54.356
It's time to find my sword.
