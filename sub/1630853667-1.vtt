WEBVTT

00:45.220 --> 00:49.585
- Here we stand,
on the shoulders of giants.

00:49.620 --> 00:51.488
These are our words

00:51.523 --> 00:55.657
and our sacred charge.

00:55.692 --> 00:59.364
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

00:59.399 --> 01:02.433
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

01:02.468 --> 01:04.534
Tame the world to our will,

01:04.569 --> 01:08.901
and spread across the stars
at the speed of light.

01:08.936 --> 01:12.542
That same greatness may be in
you.

01:12.577 --> 01:16.546
Now it's time to find out.

01:16.981 --> 01:19.417
Your Academies have nominated
you

01:19.452 --> 01:20.583
for your ambition,

01:20.618 --> 01:24.224
your drive, your potential for
greatness.

01:24.259 --> 01:26.457
It's time to prove yourself
worthy

01:26.492 --> 01:31.495
in the Sol Invictus games...

01:32.130 --> 01:35.499
You and your team will
be cast across the stars

01:35.534 --> 01:36.896
to a pre-selected planet.

01:36.931 --> 01:39.800
Your mission is a race against
time

01:39.835 --> 01:42.308
and a triumph of will.

01:42.343 --> 01:44.310
You are to set up camp

01:44.345 --> 01:46.543
establish a foothold for your
Academy

01:46.578 --> 01:49.810
and use all the tools at your
disposal.

01:49.845 --> 01:52.747
You are to search the sky and
pinpoint

01:52.782 --> 01:54.749
out of all the stars in the sky

01:54.784 --> 02:00.194
which is Earth's sun: Sol.

02:05.366 --> 02:07.894
But be warned: only one team can
win

02:07.929 --> 02:10.798
and each Academy has sent their
best

02:10.833 --> 02:13.636
and brightest to compete against
you.

02:13.671 --> 02:15.902
Your team Captain will lead you.

02:15.937 --> 02:18.278
Your Astronomer will search the
skies.

02:18.313 --> 02:20.511
And your team must form a
cohesive unit

02:20.546 --> 02:22.843
to have any hope of victory.

02:22.878 --> 02:27.947
We're strong together, broken
apart.

02:27.982 --> 02:31.324
Eternal glory awaits the winner.

02:31.359 --> 02:33.524
Use all the tools and wits you
have

02:33.559 --> 02:35.427
to prove your greatness.

02:35.462 --> 02:37.330
But move quickly.

02:37.365 --> 02:40.531
Only the victorious team may
return home.

02:40.566 --> 02:43.435
The cosmos are dark and
dangerous.

02:43.470 --> 02:47.241
There's no room for mediocrity.

02:47.969 --> 02:51.773
Return a champion or not at all.

02:51.808 --> 02:55.480
Winning is the only rule.

02:58.419 --> 03:01.453
- Welcome to Sol Invictus...

03:10.431 --> 03:12.266
We have to turn it off!

03:12.301 --> 03:13.762
What about the rest of them?

03:13.797 --> 03:15.764
They haven't made it out yet!

03:15.799 --> 03:19.273
Leave 'em! The Slip Gate's gonna
collapse!

03:23.774 --> 03:25.774
I can fix this!

03:27.481 --> 03:29.745
Take this!

03:35.423 --> 03:36.587
They're still inside!

03:36.622 --> 03:38.688
Look out!

03:38.923 --> 03:40.690
That's all I can do!

03:40.725 --> 03:43.495
Clear out! Run!

04:14.858 --> 04:16.022
Okay listen up.

04:16.057 --> 04:17.826
Something must have happened to
the gate.

04:17.861 --> 04:19.828
The rest of our teams haven't
come through.

04:19.863 --> 04:22.864
Am I the only Team Captain?

04:23.570 --> 04:25.405
Eli?

04:26.001 --> 04:28.639
What are you doing here?

04:28.841 --> 04:30.608
I came out.

04:30.643 --> 04:32.379
With Virgo Academy.

04:32.414 --> 04:35.448
Is anyone here a Team Engineer?

04:35.750 --> 04:36.944
What's your name?

04:36.979 --> 04:39.815
Ira. From Aries Academy.

04:39.850 --> 04:41.817
Come with me.

04:57.670 --> 05:00.440
The rest of my team,
they hadn't come through yet!

05:00.475 --> 05:01.771
My brother was with them.

05:01.806 --> 05:03.773
Mine too. Listen to me, Ira.

05:03.808 --> 05:05.511
Can you get the rest of my team
through?

05:05.546 --> 05:08.514
I don't know.
I've never worked a Slip Gate
before.

05:08.549 --> 05:09.812
They don't teach us how.

05:09.847 --> 05:11.583
I need you to try. Try hard.

05:11.618 --> 05:14.355
I still have a competition to
win.

05:15.721 --> 05:17.457
I think...

05:17.492 --> 05:19.756
I think it's broken on our end.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.671
Hey!

05:33.706 --> 05:35.068
Pick it up.

05:35.103 --> 05:36.740
What?

05:36.775 --> 05:39.446
You're a Team Chronicle.
You need to record this!

05:39.481 --> 05:40.645
There's nothing to record.

05:40.680 --> 05:42.647
My team didn't make it through.

05:42.682 --> 05:44.616
There's enough of my team to
compete.

05:44.651 --> 05:47.553
We need a Chronicle to prove our
win.

05:47.588 --> 05:48.851
You're one of us now, shrimp.

05:48.886 --> 05:49.918
My name's Kit!

05:49.953 --> 05:51.458
Kyle Ian Troy.

05:51.493 --> 05:54.725
Well now you're a Gemini, Kit.

05:54.760 --> 05:57.156
Now pick it up!

06:02.702 --> 06:04.702
Lee?

06:05.672 --> 06:07.936
What about the rest of them?

06:07.971 --> 06:09.938
Leave 'em.

06:09.973 --> 06:11.940
They're just dead weight.

06:11.975 --> 06:14.074
A lot of our team didn't make it
through.

06:14.109 --> 06:16.780
We could use the extra hands.

06:16.815 --> 06:19.750
The rest of you, you're coming
with us.

06:19.785 --> 06:22.654
You're all from Gemini now.

06:22.689 --> 06:25.591
I'm not on your team.

06:26.627 --> 06:28.462
Why should I follow you?

06:28.497 --> 06:29.925
Your teammates aren't coming.

06:29.960 --> 06:31.597
Face it.

06:31.632 --> 06:35.029
Come with us and you may
get credit as part of our team.

06:35.064 --> 06:37.097
Don't want to be one of us? Then
stay.

06:37.132 --> 06:39.473
You can be our competition...

06:39.508 --> 06:41.640
Your call.

06:59.055 --> 07:00.857
This isn't right.

07:00.892 --> 07:04.025
The games are supposed
to be on a forest world.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.500
Make sure to include
that in your Chronicle.

07:06.535 --> 07:09.162
Judges won't believe this
unless they see proof.

07:09.197 --> 07:14.134
Maybe we'll get a special
honor for winning out here.

07:14.169 --> 07:17.203
Do you think this happened
to the girl's Games too?

07:17.238 --> 07:20.646
We'd have heard wouldn't we?

07:25.851 --> 07:29.281
If we're going to find Sol
first we need to set up,

07:29.316 --> 07:31.283
learn the area.

07:31.318 --> 07:33.285
Scouts, this way. Scour the
place.

07:33.320 --> 07:35.529
Find anything that might be
useful.

07:37.962 --> 07:39.797
I know you!

07:39.832 --> 07:41.667
You're the guy that won last
year.

07:41.702 --> 07:43.570
You won Sol Invictus!

07:43.605 --> 07:47.134
But... You were disqualified
weren't you?

07:47.169 --> 07:50.643
That's right! You were DQ'd for
cheating.

07:50.678 --> 07:53.239
Must have been embarrassing
to have that taken away.

07:53.274 --> 07:55.241
I'd watch what I was saying

07:55.276 --> 07:58.013
if I didn't have my team here
to back me up...

07:58.048 --> 07:59.619
Maybe you should.

07:59.654 --> 08:02.754
You two, you know each other?

08:04.153 --> 08:05.185
We used to.

08:05.220 --> 08:06.219
What class are you?

08:06.254 --> 08:07.594
Astronomer.

08:07.629 --> 08:09.024
I'm Eli from Virgo.

08:09.059 --> 08:11.026
We've already got an Astronomer.

08:11.061 --> 08:13.028
Lee, should we drop this one?

08:13.063 --> 08:14.161
What about you?

08:14.196 --> 08:15.162
Me?

08:15.197 --> 08:16.801
You're scouts now.

08:16.836 --> 08:18.902
Find everything you can about
this place.

08:18.937 --> 08:21.740
But we don't have weapons.
What if it's dangerous?

08:21.775 --> 08:23.742
Then you'll be the first to
know.

08:23.777 --> 08:25.744
Strength in numbers, right?

08:25.779 --> 08:28.076
Rest of you scouts, let's move
out!

08:28.111 --> 08:30.243
I want camp set up before
sunset!

08:30.278 --> 08:33.983
We've got a lot of stars to
search through.

08:38.759 --> 08:40.792
This could go on for miles.

08:40.827 --> 08:43.256
And I think the air is thinner
out here.

08:50.131 --> 08:53.739
They're not going to send
any search parties.

08:53.774 --> 08:55.741
They don't send help.

08:55.776 --> 08:58.106
But we're on the wrong planet.
Won't they come looking?

08:58.141 --> 09:01.846
You sure they know something's
wrong?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.047
Did you hear that? Listen...

09:09.119 --> 09:11.658
Eli, wait!

09:19.701 --> 09:21.899
An ocean?!

09:21.934 --> 09:25.001
I've never seen a real one
before...

09:31.746 --> 09:34.846
How much do you think
this is worth back home?

09:34.881 --> 09:36.980
Hard to tell.

09:37.015 --> 09:39.213
It could go on forever.

09:39.248 --> 09:42.018
But it's fresh water that they
need.

09:42.053 --> 09:44.988
What should we do about the
Geminis?

09:45.023 --> 09:47.023
Should we run?

09:47.729 --> 09:49.927
Then what?

09:55.704 --> 09:57.231
Don't say that to me!

09:57.266 --> 09:59.233
What do you mean there's no
food?

09:59.268 --> 10:00.432
You're the Chef.

10:00.467 --> 10:03.039
It's your job to make sure
everyone is fed!

10:03.074 --> 10:05.041
I know that.

10:05.076 --> 10:08.209
It's just: all our food
was with the Porters.

10:09.078 --> 10:13.181
I've got a few essentials but
nothing else.

10:14.921 --> 10:17.889
There's not enough for
everyone...

11:25.288 --> 11:28.157
Kit! What are you doing?!
Record this!

11:38.499 --> 11:40.466
We have to go!

11:40.501 --> 11:42.875
If we get to water maybe they
can't swim!

11:42.910 --> 11:44.844
I'm not going out there!

11:44.879 --> 11:46.406
If we get to the ocean we might
make it!

11:46.441 --> 11:49.409
We can't make it!

13:37.123 --> 13:39.519
You made it! How?

13:39.554 --> 13:41.356
Spent the night in a tree.

13:41.391 --> 13:44.326
Those - whatever they are -
hunters

13:44.361 --> 13:46.625
lost interest in me a few hours
ago.

13:46.660 --> 13:49.903
Took the rest and left.

13:55.471 --> 13:57.471
It's still running!

14:00.146 --> 14:02.509
Maybe we can see... what
happened.

14:02.544 --> 14:05.446
No one should see what those
things do.

14:08.253 --> 14:10.484
Just the four of us?

14:10.519 --> 14:12.519
We're all that made it?

14:12.554 --> 14:14.257
What are you doing?!

14:14.292 --> 14:16.028
You can't just leave.

14:16.063 --> 14:18.294
Look what staying in a group
got the rest of them.

14:18.329 --> 14:20.329
I'm going solo.

14:20.364 --> 14:22.331
I got to camp first so this
stuff is mine.

14:22.366 --> 14:24.333
That's not fair you were
the first to run too!

14:24.368 --> 14:25.367
This stuff is mine!

14:25.402 --> 14:26.940
You want to prove it, shrimp?

14:26.975 --> 14:28.007
My name is Kit!

14:28.042 --> 14:28.975
Keep quiet!

14:29.010 --> 14:30.977
We're not splitting up.

14:31.012 --> 14:34.574
If the Geminis can put
together a team so can we.

14:34.609 --> 14:37.247
They didn't know about
the Hunters but now we do.

14:37.282 --> 14:38.644
We don't even have half a team.

14:38.679 --> 14:41.086
You know the rules...

14:41.121 --> 14:45.618
There's still a team
as long as there's a Captain.

14:45.653 --> 14:47.620
I know the rules.

14:47.655 --> 14:50.128
You're an Astronomer.
I don't have to listen to you.

14:50.163 --> 14:52.427
Don't listen to me then.

14:53.265 --> 14:55.133
Listen to Tyl.

14:55.168 --> 14:57.938
He's the only Team Captain now.

15:01.438 --> 15:02.976
What are you doing!?

15:03.011 --> 15:06.078
I want as many eyes watching
my back as possible.

15:06.113 --> 15:08.542
The best chance we have
is if we stick together, right?

15:08.577 --> 15:09.741
Yeah but-

15:09.776 --> 15:12.183
Then you have to force them into
a team!

15:12.218 --> 15:14.218
But I'm not a Captain!

15:21.623 --> 15:23.491
You are now.

15:23.526 --> 15:26.230
So start acting like it.

15:28.036 --> 15:29.497
The games are over!

15:29.532 --> 15:32.104
There's gotta be someone
here with a communicator.

15:32.139 --> 15:33.468
I'm calling home.

15:33.503 --> 15:35.767
If someone was out here
we'd have seen them.

15:35.802 --> 15:37.505
We're alone.

15:37.540 --> 15:39.177
Then what are we supposed to do?

15:39.212 --> 15:40.378
We still have a telescope.

15:40.413 --> 15:42.741
We followed the Geminis because
they were supposed to win

15:42.776 --> 15:44.413
and get us picked up.

15:44.448 --> 15:45.645
We'll just do the same.

15:45.680 --> 15:46.713
And those Hunters?

15:46.748 --> 15:50.221
We'll stick to the shore
so we can see them coming.

15:50.256 --> 15:51.717
Maybe they can't swim.

15:51.752 --> 15:54.225
Scorpius team is still out
there...

15:54.260 --> 15:57.162
They'll finish what those
Hunters started.

15:57.197 --> 15:59.428
I'm safer hiding on my own.

15:59.463 --> 16:03.630
Do me a favor and stay away from
me.

16:08.076 --> 16:11.374
Just because we're in this
together
doesn't mean we're a team.

16:11.409 --> 16:13.475
I'm only following you
because you have the scope.

16:13.510 --> 16:15.741
I don't think so...

16:16.243 --> 16:18.249
Tyl, the lens is cracked.

16:18.284 --> 16:20.251
What?!

16:20.586 --> 16:23.518
See? Crack runs the whole
length.

16:23.553 --> 16:26.257
Great! You couldn't spot shit
with that!

16:26.292 --> 16:27.753
Now what, Team Captain!?

16:29.229 --> 16:30.723
Rescue party!

16:36.632 --> 16:39.138
Do you see anything!?

16:42.143 --> 16:44.440
Guys?

16:44.475 --> 16:46.574
We're not alone out here...

16:49.513 --> 16:52.184
What do you mean?

16:52.686 --> 16:55.451
See for yourself.

16:57.521 --> 16:59.851
Doesn't look like a rescue
party.

16:59.886 --> 17:01.391
Should we talk to him?

17:01.426 --> 17:02.459
I don't know.

17:02.494 --> 17:05.692
I've heard stories about
strange people off-world.

17:05.727 --> 17:08.332
What's he doing here?

17:11.634 --> 17:16.571
Whatever you do, you better
hurry.

17:23.712 --> 17:25.250
Where are you from!?

17:25.285 --> 17:26.449
Scorpius? Virgo? Corona?

17:26.484 --> 17:27.517
I'm not from any of those!

17:27.552 --> 17:29.716
Did you kill somebody who was
and take his gear?

17:29.751 --> 17:31.157
It's nothing like that!

17:31.192 --> 17:32.818
I'll be the judge of that!

17:35.328 --> 17:37.295
You don't know what you're
doing!
Let go of me!

17:37.330 --> 17:38.626
You don't know what you're
doing!

17:38.661 --> 17:40.694
You can't trust the other
Academies!

17:40.729 --> 17:43.433
I know! But he's not from an
Academy.

17:47.802 --> 17:48.935
How'd you get here?

17:48.970 --> 17:52.409
I was late for the start so
they just sent me through.

17:52.444 --> 17:54.642
Did they say anything about
trouble with the Gates?!

17:54.677 --> 17:57.414
No it was business as usual.
Why?

17:57.449 --> 17:59.812
Do you have a communicator?

17:59.847 --> 18:02.881
My teammates have all that.

18:03.554 --> 18:05.884
Where's my team?

18:06.419 --> 18:09.822
They didn't make it.

18:10.424 --> 18:13.595
You can be sad later.
We need to find a way home.

18:13.630 --> 18:16.334
Do you have any equipment we can
use?

18:16.369 --> 18:19.469
It was all broken when I got
here
so I dropped it.

18:19.504 --> 18:21.537
Where did you leave it?

18:21.572 --> 18:23.803
There was nothing worthwhile
left.

18:23.838 --> 18:25.409
I'm positive.

18:25.444 --> 18:27.774
We'll be the judge of that.

18:34.288 --> 18:36.915
There it is.

18:40.393 --> 18:42.492
That's close enough!

18:46.762 --> 18:48.366
Where's the rest of your team?

18:48.401 --> 18:49.895
I hid.

18:49.930 --> 18:52.205
The rest didn't.

18:52.240 --> 18:54.834
But it looks like my fortunes
have turned.

18:54.869 --> 18:56.572
Step back.

18:56.607 --> 18:58.277
How'd you get a gun through the
Gate?

18:58.312 --> 19:00.279
Made it with his stuff.

19:00.314 --> 19:02.974
That's all the valuables the
half-wit left.

19:03.009 --> 19:05.515
Gate must have ruined the rest.

19:05.550 --> 19:08.254
But you seem like a guy
with a lot more to give.

19:08.289 --> 19:09.453
What do you want?

19:09.488 --> 19:11.455
Your telescope for starters.

19:11.490 --> 19:13.325
Mine needs some parts

19:13.360 --> 19:15.228
and you're gonna give them to
me.

19:15.263 --> 19:17.230
Is this all in your party?

19:17.265 --> 19:19.595
You got a camp nearby?

19:19.630 --> 19:21.927
You're gonna give me all your
belongings

19:21.962 --> 19:25.271
and I'll consider letting
you live to be rescued.

19:25.306 --> 19:27.900
We're dead without our stuff
and you know it.

19:27.935 --> 19:29.308
Not my problem.

19:29.343 --> 19:31.673
No. You can't have it.

19:31.708 --> 19:34.445
Show me your camp or I can just

19:34.480 --> 19:37.514
kill you and find it myself!

19:40.321 --> 19:41.087
He's a kid!

19:41.122 --> 19:42.618
He'll just die on his own
anyway.

19:42.653 --> 19:45.357
You need parts and so do we.

19:45.392 --> 19:48.261
Does your telescope have a lens?

19:48.296 --> 19:51.429
Put it in ours and we can work
together.

19:51.464 --> 19:54.465
We can all go home tonight.

19:58.834 --> 20:01.967
Tell your friend to come over.

20:18.291 --> 20:21.789
You didn't bring a tent
but you brought that?

20:22.458 --> 20:25.397
It helps me when I'm nervous.

20:25.632 --> 20:27.960
Tyl, you're Team Captain.

20:27.995 --> 20:29.995
You get first try.

20:50.490 --> 20:53.557
Let me show you how it's done!

21:00.401 --> 21:02.368
There it is.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.065
What?!

21:07.100 --> 21:08.836
This thing is broken!

21:08.871 --> 21:10.101
You rigged it!

21:10.136 --> 21:12.840
Would we really rig it to cheat
ourselves?

21:26.823 --> 21:30.363
We can't do this without
the rest of our teams.

21:30.398 --> 21:32.365
We need their equipment.

21:32.400 --> 21:35.896
What else can we do? We have to
try.

21:39.407 --> 21:42.705
I have no idea where Sol is. Do
you?

21:49.879 --> 21:51.846
Why can't you just find it?

21:51.881 --> 21:53.386
We have no tools!

21:53.421 --> 21:54.849
No idea where we are

21:54.884 --> 21:57.852
and no idea where our sun is
hiding!

21:57.887 --> 21:59.590
You're so smart?

21:59.625 --> 22:01.526
Find it yourself.

22:14.739 --> 22:16.706
Can I sleep in here?

22:22.846 --> 22:25.077
Come on, Kit.

22:25.112 --> 22:27.178
We need to rest.

22:44.065 --> 22:48.573
Come on Kit, we'll look again
tomorrow.

23:08.760 --> 23:11.827
Do you think rescue ships
will scout this area soon?

23:11.862 --> 23:14.192
I don't think they know
anything's wrong.

23:14.227 --> 23:16.194
Even if they did

23:16.229 --> 23:19.197
it could take months for them to
find us.

23:19.599 --> 23:22.068
Maybe years...

23:22.403 --> 23:25.874
We'll just have to survive
long enough to win.

23:25.909 --> 23:29.713
They put us in teams
for the best chance of survival.

23:29.748 --> 23:31.715
We're gonna keep doing it that
way.

23:31.750 --> 23:33.013
Hal, you're a cook right?

23:33.048 --> 23:34.817
It's your job to make sure we
can eat.

23:34.852 --> 23:36.984
But there's nothing out there!
I can't work like this!

23:37.019 --> 23:38.249
None of us should have to.

23:38.284 --> 23:41.021
We all have to pickup duties
we didn't want.

23:41.056 --> 23:44.024
Adrian, you're offense?
Find anything you can out here.

23:44.059 --> 23:45.564
Especially water...

23:45.599 --> 23:47.566
I'm Security against other
teams.

23:47.601 --> 23:49.568
That makes me second in command.

23:49.603 --> 23:50.899
You can't reassign me.

23:50.934 --> 23:53.605
All the other teams are dead.

23:53.640 --> 23:55.607
You're a Scout now.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.609
Lex, you're a Technician.

23:57.644 --> 23:59.611
Kit, you're a Chronicle?

23:59.646 --> 24:00.445
Keep recording.

24:00.480 --> 24:03.747
If we do get back you're the
only one

24:03.782 --> 24:05.782
that can prove we didn't cheat.

24:05.817 --> 24:07.817
We're all a team now.

24:32.844 --> 24:34.910
Gone...

24:34.945 --> 24:36.912
It's all gone.

24:36.947 --> 24:39.112
There has to be good water
somewhere.

24:39.147 --> 24:40.883
We just have to find it.

24:40.918 --> 24:42.951
What are we supposed to do till
then?

24:42.986 --> 24:44.953
Stop sweating?

24:45.155 --> 24:48.220
I can't keep going on like this.

24:50.829 --> 24:52.191
He's got water!

24:52.226 --> 24:53.192
What?

24:53.227 --> 24:54.963
There! In his jacket!

24:54.998 --> 24:56.965
I don't have any water!

24:57.000 --> 24:58.736
If I did I wouldn't share it
with you...

24:58.771 --> 24:59.935
His lips are wet.

24:59.970 --> 25:01.574
You think I've got water?

25:01.609 --> 25:02.839
Try and take it.

25:02.874 --> 25:04.874
See what happens.

25:14.215 --> 25:17.282
Howard, wait!

25:23.224 --> 25:28.029
Don't drink that!
You're gonna make it worse!

25:29.263 --> 25:32.638
It's fresh...

25:34.675 --> 25:36.235
Fresh! It's fresh!

25:36.270 --> 25:38.237
Fresh water!

25:38.272 --> 25:40.239
Can you imagine what
this is worth back home?

25:40.274 --> 25:42.109
They could stop drilling the
moon.

25:42.144 --> 25:43.682
And Europa...

25:43.717 --> 25:45.981
This could change everything!

25:47.853 --> 25:49.820
How could they have missed this?

25:49.855 --> 25:52.790
The Gate must have been built
before the oceans dried.

25:52.825 --> 25:54.660
They weren't looking.

26:18.345 --> 26:20.312
Lex!

26:21.953 --> 26:23.183
Hold him down!

26:23.218 --> 26:25.185
Kit! Water now!

26:25.220 --> 26:27.693
Kit, come on!

26:33.030 --> 26:35.096
What happened?

26:35.131 --> 26:38.429
I don't know. I don't know...

26:38.464 --> 26:41.300
I was just trying to find Sol

26:41.335 --> 26:44.204
and the damn thing shocked me!

26:44.239 --> 26:46.206
Nice job putting it together.

26:46.241 --> 26:48.208
You trying to kill me?!

26:48.243 --> 26:50.782
What's this for?

26:51.719 --> 26:54.313
Part of the scope is open.

26:55.250 --> 26:58.053
You were trying to cheat!

26:58.088 --> 27:00.825
You tried tricking it
to think you found Sol!

27:00.860 --> 27:02.354
But scopes are tamper proof!

27:02.389 --> 27:04.895
Yeah it shocked him in defense!

27:04.930 --> 27:06.864
Does it still work!?

27:09.902 --> 27:11.132
Yeah.

27:11.167 --> 27:13.134
We should throw him out.

27:13.169 --> 27:15.741
Before he pulls something like
this again.

27:15.776 --> 27:16.973
Lex?

27:17.008 --> 27:20.845
Do it! I dare you!

27:20.880 --> 27:26.884
You need me as much as I need
your stuff.

27:29.020 --> 27:32.285
That's what I thought.

27:34.454 --> 27:36.828
Thanks for the water!

27:36.863 --> 27:39.259
You're not letting him get
away with that are you?

27:39.294 --> 27:41.261
You have to kick him out!

27:41.296 --> 27:42.460
I'm not doing that!

27:42.495 --> 27:44.737
What if he cheats again, or does
worse?

27:44.772 --> 27:45.671
What will you do?

27:45.707 --> 27:48.037
Maybe we'll need his help! I
don't know-

27:48.072 --> 27:49.775
What do you know?!

27:49.810 --> 27:51.942
Have you ever led anyone?

27:51.977 --> 27:54.373
How long have you even been a
Team Captain?

27:55.211 --> 27:57.178
No.

27:57.213 --> 27:59.213
You can't handle this.

28:21.369 --> 28:23.534
Look for a clearing.

28:23.569 --> 28:26.207
Any opening big enough to gather
logs.

28:26.242 --> 28:28.308
But we have a light,
we don't need to build a fire.

28:28.343 --> 28:29.540
Not for that!

28:29.575 --> 28:30.948
Then what?

28:30.983 --> 28:33.412
We're not making a fire, kid.

28:33.447 --> 28:34.820
It's for a boat.

28:34.855 --> 28:36.085
Why?

28:36.120 --> 28:38.087
We're leaving.

28:38.122 --> 28:42.421
Do you really want to stay
with those Hunters?

28:43.358 --> 28:45.061
What if this is the only land?

28:45.096 --> 28:46.799
You'd rather wait here to be
eaten?

28:46.834 --> 28:48.064
Look...

28:48.099 --> 28:51.199
This can't be the only land.

28:51.234 --> 28:53.971
Someone's gotta be out there.

28:54.006 --> 28:55.335
And we can find 'em.

28:55.370 --> 28:58.371
And contact home.

28:59.209 --> 29:00.912
Now go.

29:00.947 --> 29:04.410
Find logs. Get good ones.

29:28.634 --> 29:31.338
I can't hold on!

29:32.979 --> 29:33.978
Lex!

29:34.013 --> 29:35.375
I'm slipping!

29:35.410 --> 29:37.377
Somebody help me!

29:37.412 --> 29:39.049
Anybody!

29:39.084 --> 29:40.215
Help!

29:41.889 --> 29:43.856
Hang on!

29:43.891 --> 29:45.858
It's gonna pull us in too!

29:45.893 --> 29:47.222
Help!

30:19.157 --> 30:21.058
Tyl, help us!

30:21.093 --> 30:24.094
We need your help! Hurry!

30:32.537 --> 30:34.874
I think he's poisoned.

30:35.701 --> 30:37.943
It's killing him.

30:40.442 --> 30:42.343
What do we do?!

30:44.512 --> 30:46.578
Right here!

30:47.013 --> 30:49.383
The med-pack!

30:51.959 --> 30:53.959
Here!

30:54.861 --> 30:58.458
The venom's bad.
I don't know if he'll make it!

30:58.493 --> 31:01.692
Here, you clean the wound!

31:09.669 --> 31:11.702
Where's the sting kit!?

31:11.737 --> 31:13.946
I'm looking!

31:14.281 --> 31:16.542
Oh no. It's broken!

31:16.577 --> 31:18.544
Are there more?

31:18.579 --> 31:20.546
Hurry!

31:20.581 --> 31:23.153
This is our last one.

31:23.188 --> 31:26.420
Wait! We gotta save it.

31:26.455 --> 31:27.421
What?!

31:27.456 --> 31:28.994
What if one of us gets stung?

31:29.029 --> 31:30.424
He's right.

31:30.459 --> 31:33.130
Use it now and you won't
have one for yourself later.

31:33.165 --> 31:36.001
But he's hurt now!

31:36.465 --> 31:39.103
Use it, Tyl!

31:49.280 --> 31:52.985
Think there could be
more of those things, Lex?

31:53.020 --> 31:57.220
If we're stuck here
it's not long till we find out.

32:04.493 --> 32:07.593
We're not going to
make it out of here are we?

32:22.208 --> 32:24.709
How long will this last?

32:30.783 --> 32:32.750
They're coming!

32:38.791 --> 32:40.725
I'm not staying here. Not again!

32:40.760 --> 32:42.298
Me neither!

32:42.333 --> 32:44.300
He'll bring the Hunters right to
us!

32:45.303 --> 32:46.135
Leave him!

32:46.171 --> 32:48.304
Someone has to stay and keep him
quiet

32:48.339 --> 32:50.306
or they'll find him for sure!

32:52.840 --> 32:55.212
Eli's the only one that
doesn't do his job anymore.

32:55.247 --> 32:56.642
He's least essential.

32:56.677 --> 32:57.509
Hey! I-

32:57.545 --> 33:01.350
I record, Hal cooks, Lex fixes
things

33:01.385 --> 33:02.747
and Tyl saves people.

33:02.782 --> 33:05.750
Have you found Sol yet?

33:05.785 --> 33:08.588
No but I try every night!

33:08.623 --> 33:10.161
He's right, Eli.

33:10.196 --> 33:12.163
You're the least important.

33:12.198 --> 33:14.495
Stay here with Adrian.

33:14.530 --> 33:16.794
Okay...

33:16.829 --> 33:18.796
Lex, is that gun still in your
pack?

33:18.831 --> 33:20.798
No, stay out of my pack!

33:20.833 --> 33:22.800
Leave it! No time!

33:49.895 --> 33:52.500
There! At our camp.

33:57.408 --> 33:59.375
What are you doing?

34:09.717 --> 34:14.687
If they go after Eli then
they won't come after us.

34:33.675 --> 34:35.345
You tried to kill me!

34:35.380 --> 34:38.447
Don't pity yourself too much.
You look fine...

34:38.482 --> 34:40.680
Whatever you did to chase them
off worked.

34:40.715 --> 34:42.550
I didn't do anything!

34:42.585 --> 34:46.158
Something kept them away...

34:51.924 --> 34:53.759
The light!

34:53.794 --> 34:54.694
What?

34:54.729 --> 34:57.664
Maybe they're afraid of it.

34:59.338 --> 35:02.273
We have only seen them at night.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.737
Maybe the light hurts them.

35:04.772 --> 35:06.541
Burns them.

35:06.576 --> 35:08.510
Do you think it's just the
lantern?

35:08.545 --> 35:09.940
I don't know.

35:09.975 --> 35:14.318
But it's not gonna last
forever...

35:29.368 --> 35:31.929
As long as there are people on
this island

35:31.964 --> 35:36.208
there will be a fire...

36:16.745 --> 36:18.910
Are we sure this will work?

36:18.945 --> 36:21.286
Will fire really keep them away?

36:21.321 --> 36:22.617
I don't know.

36:22.652 --> 36:24.619
When will we know!?

36:24.654 --> 36:28.656
When the Hunters come and eat us
or not!

36:29.494 --> 36:32.297
We should get some rest.

36:32.332 --> 36:34.596
I can't sleep like this.

36:34.631 --> 36:37.434
Me neither.

37:02.791 --> 37:05.792
Where's Lex?

37:05.827 --> 37:07.926
Who cares.

37:07.961 --> 37:10.434
We're almost out of wood.

37:12.768 --> 37:15.340
Who's coming with?

37:15.375 --> 37:18.277
I can't go back out there.

39:04.550 --> 39:07.584
Guess you were right about the
light.

39:31.577 --> 39:33.775
What? What happened?!

39:33.810 --> 39:36.811
We found something!

39:41.917 --> 39:44.918
I've never seen one before
but...

39:44.953 --> 39:46.623
I think it's a Stormrunner!

39:46.658 --> 39:48.053
Can't be! That would mean it's

39:48.088 --> 39:51.221
Over two hundred years old...

39:58.637 --> 40:01.539
Where's the rest of it?

40:07.041 --> 40:08.810
It's still intact!

40:08.845 --> 40:09.778
What is?

40:09.813 --> 40:13.045
The computer core, it's still
functional!

40:13.080 --> 40:17.148
But the control element's gone.

40:17.183 --> 40:18.985
Without that it's useless.

40:19.020 --> 40:20.987
Just needs a jump-start huh?

40:21.022 --> 40:22.989
This is a waste of our time,
Tyl.

40:23.024 --> 40:25.761
I didn't bring you here for
nostalgia.

40:25.796 --> 40:28.533
I need help carrying something.

40:28.568 --> 40:30.535
What are we supposed to do with
this junk?!

40:30.570 --> 40:32.537
Look how old it is!

40:32.572 --> 40:34.869
That's not junk you're looking
at.

40:34.904 --> 40:37.641
There's a Trans-Conduit relay in
there.

40:37.676 --> 40:38.939
You sure?

40:38.974 --> 40:42.646
Checked it myself. Still works.

40:42.681 --> 40:44.714
I know what you're thinking.

40:44.749 --> 40:47.651
But if we screw this up
it could ruin the telescope.

40:47.686 --> 40:50.819
Isn't it worth the risk?

41:04.065 --> 41:08.573
This was a Hyperion ship...

41:09.108 --> 41:11.774
If the Hyperions couldn't
survive here

41:11.809 --> 41:15.745
how are we supposed to?

41:24.921 --> 41:27.658
A Trans-Conduit relay lets any
computer

41:27.693 --> 41:30.694
connect to the network
that links every system.

41:30.729 --> 41:32.696
If we hook it to the scope

41:32.731 --> 41:36.095
we might be able to
send a message back to Earth.

41:36.130 --> 41:37.195
Let me do it.

41:37.230 --> 41:38.702
It's not that simple.

41:38.737 --> 41:39.934
Overload the conductor and

41:39.969 --> 41:41.936
the whole thing's cooked!

41:41.971 --> 41:43.333
That's why I'm doing it...

41:43.368 --> 41:45.203
How long will it take to contact
home?

41:45.238 --> 41:48.338
It's not as easy as calling mom
and dad...

41:48.373 --> 41:50.076
Connecting with Terra-Net only
lets us

41:50.111 --> 41:53.277
transmit messages to individual
addresses.

41:53.312 --> 41:56.247
If a message actually makes
it...

41:56.282 --> 41:58.249
They'll have to record their own
reply

41:58.284 --> 42:01.626
and hope it finds its way
back to the scope.

42:01.661 --> 42:03.089
Which it won't.

42:03.124 --> 42:04.354
If someone responds

42:04.389 --> 42:06.895
we can triangulate our position

42:06.930 --> 42:09.194
and have them send help.

42:10.736 --> 42:12.901
Here we go...

42:14.806 --> 42:15.673
Did you break it?

42:15.708 --> 42:16.839
Can we fix it?

42:16.874 --> 42:18.368
It's fine, I just need my
splicer.

42:18.403 --> 42:19.369
Where is it?

42:19.404 --> 42:20.645
My pack, I'll get it.

42:20.680 --> 42:23.307
No you keep working on it.
Howard?

42:56.749 --> 42:58.078
What are you doing with that?!

42:58.113 --> 43:00.344
Shut your goddamn mouth!

43:00.379 --> 43:01.312
What's the matter?

43:01.347 --> 43:03.215
Day- Assessed Slip Gate.

43:03.250 --> 43:05.184
Unable to establish return
portal

43:05.219 --> 43:07.725
for more than three seconds.

43:07.760 --> 43:09.727
Replaced coupler. No
improvement.

43:09.762 --> 43:12.224
Day- Gemini telescope battery

43:12.259 --> 43:14.798
unable to jump-start Gate.

43:14.833 --> 43:17.702
Day- Energy source to power
Gate

43:17.737 --> 43:19.297
needs to be larger.

43:19.332 --> 43:20.903
Day- Found crashed ship.

43:20.938 --> 43:22.806
Should be able to salvage parts

43:22.841 --> 43:24.038
to stabilize Gate.

43:24.073 --> 43:25.402
He has been sneaking off

43:25.437 --> 43:28.977
and working on the Slip Gate all
this time!

43:29.848 --> 43:31.947
Can you fix it?

43:32.279 --> 43:33.982
No.

43:34.017 --> 43:35.984
We don't have the parts.

43:36.019 --> 43:36.985
Why didn't you tell us?

43:37.020 --> 43:40.087
Because he didn't
want to bring us with him!

43:40.122 --> 43:42.386
He was going to leave us here

43:42.421 --> 43:44.828
so that he can go home
and win the games on his own.

43:44.863 --> 43:46.830
I would have sent help when I
got back!

43:46.865 --> 43:49.129
You've been lying to us this
whole time!

43:49.164 --> 43:51.131
How do you know so much
about Slip Gates, Lex?

43:51.166 --> 43:52.968
Nobody's allowed to learn how
they work-

43:53.003 --> 43:54.937
You did this, didn't you?

43:54.972 --> 43:56.939
Didn't you!?

43:56.974 --> 43:59.711
You sabotaged the Slip Gate
network...

43:59.746 --> 44:01.174
You rigged it so we'd be stuck

44:01.209 --> 44:03.440
on this backwater planet
with no chance of winning.

44:03.475 --> 44:05.981
But you did too good of a job.

44:06.016 --> 44:07.785
Your team crashed the network so
bad

44:07.820 --> 44:09.413
that it sucked everyone in.

44:09.448 --> 44:11.415
You fell into your own trap.

44:11.450 --> 44:12.757
Is he right?

44:12.792 --> 44:13.923
Tell us!

44:13.958 --> 44:14.957
Why'd you do it!?

44:14.992 --> 44:17.927
Because I have to win!

44:20.228 --> 44:23.867
If I don't bring back that
Hyperion coin...

44:25.167 --> 44:27.299
You wouldn't understand.

44:27.334 --> 44:29.466
I had to do it!

44:29.501 --> 44:31.743
Everything that's happened...

44:31.778 --> 44:33.745
Everything!

44:33.780 --> 44:34.944
It's all your fault.

44:34.979 --> 44:36.473
That night with the Hunters

44:36.508 --> 44:39.014
you tried killing me to hide the
journal.

44:39.049 --> 44:40.510
Instead I saved you!

44:40.545 --> 44:44.184
Where would we be if we didn't
learn what light can do?!

44:44.219 --> 44:45.757
And the rest?

44:45.792 --> 44:48.793
This is Sol Invictus.

44:48.828 --> 44:51.125
Winning's the only rule.

44:51.160 --> 44:53.457
They should have known
what they were getting in to.

44:53.492 --> 44:55.294
Wrap it however you want.

44:55.329 --> 44:58.198
If you hadn't done that, we'd be
home now!

44:58.233 --> 45:02.301
And innocent people would still
be alive.

45:02.870 --> 45:06.503
I feel sorry for you.

45:17.417 --> 45:19.021
What are we gonna do with him?

45:19.056 --> 45:20.792
Can't trust him anymore.

45:20.827 --> 45:22.959
Before you do anything rash,

45:22.994 --> 45:24.895
afraid I need him over here.

45:25.997 --> 45:28.558
The relay's almost done.

45:28.593 --> 45:30.395
Go.

45:50.021 --> 45:51.515
The signal's too weak.

45:51.550 --> 45:53.088
That's as good as we're gonna
get.

45:53.123 --> 45:55.123
That won't get the messages
half way to Earth!

45:55.158 --> 45:58.192
Then we'll try anyway!

46:02.368 --> 46:06.266
This is Lex of Scorpius
to anyone at command.

46:06.301 --> 46:08.906
Hi, Mom and Dad...

46:09.241 --> 46:12.239
By now you've probably heard
from school.

46:12.274 --> 46:15.143
We've no idea where we are.

46:15.178 --> 46:17.145
Nobody does.

46:17.180 --> 46:19.147
My assignment

46:19.182 --> 46:22.513
did more than we could have
imagined.

46:22.548 --> 46:25.318
Trapping me on the same

46:25.353 --> 46:28.288
unknown planet as the rest of
them.

46:28.323 --> 46:31.093
Why did I come out here?

46:31.595 --> 46:34.228
Was I wrong about all this?

46:34.263 --> 46:36.593
Everything I did,

46:36.628 --> 46:39.332
I did for the mission.

47:52.407 --> 47:55.210
Please respond.

47:55.245 --> 47:57.707
Please...

47:57.742 --> 48:00.380
Say anything.

48:00.415 --> 48:03.152
I'll win.

48:03.587 --> 48:05.649
One way or the other.

48:05.684 --> 48:08.025
I can't wait to get home.

48:08.060 --> 48:10.456
I love you guys.

48:10.491 --> 48:12.491
See you soon.

48:13.329 --> 48:16.231
Say anything...

48:16.266 --> 48:19.234
I just want to hear from you.

48:34.647 --> 48:36.647
Let's send these things!

48:37.617 --> 48:39.991
Enter the address here.

48:49.035 --> 48:51.134
This is it!

49:00.607 --> 49:01.540
That's it?

49:01.575 --> 49:04.510
What were you expecting,
an instant response?

49:04.545 --> 49:06.512
It could take hours
for them to reach everyone.

49:06.547 --> 49:07.480
Then leave it on all night.

49:07.515 --> 49:10.714
I want to know the instant we
get a reply!

49:21.560 --> 49:25.597
I wonder what it looks like from
up there.

49:26.666 --> 49:30.206
From all those other fires.

49:46.290 --> 49:49.291
Want to check yours?

49:52.494 --> 49:54.263
That's enough.

49:54.298 --> 49:55.693
Time to turn it off.

49:55.728 --> 49:56.793
Wait!

49:56.828 --> 49:58.729
I want to know when they hear
from me.

49:58.764 --> 50:01.105
If we leave it on any longer
we'll kill the battery.

50:01.140 --> 50:03.041
No!

50:03.276 --> 50:05.472
Wait! I want to hear back!

50:05.507 --> 50:07.243
Turn it off or we're really
screwed!

50:07.278 --> 50:08.409
Give it to me!

50:08.444 --> 50:10.444
Let it go!

50:20.654 --> 50:22.225
Give it to me.

50:22.260 --> 50:24.656
So you're gonna shoot me now!?

50:25.725 --> 50:27.428
Give me the gun, Kit!

50:27.463 --> 50:28.561
No!

50:28.596 --> 50:30.233
Kit, give me the gun!

50:30.268 --> 50:31.696
Kit!

50:31.731 --> 50:33.599
Give me the gun!

50:33.634 --> 50:35.601
No!

50:52.158 --> 50:53.388
What'd you do!?

50:53.423 --> 50:54.686
It was an accident!

50:54.721 --> 50:56.589
I- I didn't...

50:56.624 --> 50:58.624
What have you done?!

50:59.259 --> 51:02.397
Eli, please just hold still.

51:02.432 --> 51:04.366
Just give me a second!

51:04.401 --> 51:06.467
Eli!

52:26.846 --> 52:28.384
Of course it was his fault!

52:28.419 --> 52:30.386
Okay! You're right. But...

52:30.421 --> 52:31.750
He didn't mean to-

52:31.785 --> 52:34.786
He feels even worse about it
than you do.

52:35.121 --> 52:38.691
You can't make him sleep outside
forever.

52:50.309 --> 52:52.606
You got us into this mess,

52:52.641 --> 52:54.971
it's your job to get us out.

52:55.974 --> 52:58.348
You're in charge now.

53:03.586 --> 53:06.653
Time to stop waiting.

53:22.033 --> 53:24.000
No way...

53:29.678 --> 53:31.381
Message received?

53:31.416 --> 53:32.778
Message received?!

53:32.813 --> 53:34.780
Message received!

53:34.815 --> 53:36.584
We got one! We got a reply!

53:36.619 --> 53:37.717
Somebody sent a response!

53:37.752 --> 53:40.049
Somebody heard from us!?

53:43.362 --> 53:45.626
Tyl, somebody sent a reply!

53:47.927 --> 53:49.564
Eli- Hi, Mom and Dad.

53:49.599 --> 53:50.895
We haven't received a response.

53:50.930 --> 53:53.304
It's one of our own messages
bounced back to us.

53:53.539 --> 53:55.537
It didn't even make it out of
the system.

53:57.574 --> 53:59.310
No one received any messages.

53:59.345 --> 54:01.345
No one ever will!

54:01.680 --> 54:03.941
I can't believe we thought
this thing would work.

54:05.978 --> 54:07.714
Wait a second!

54:07.749 --> 54:09.716
Just one of the messages bounced
back.

54:09.751 --> 54:11.685
Others could still make it
through!

54:11.720 --> 54:14.820
But if you break the telescope
we'll never know!

54:14.855 --> 54:16.822
To think I let you

54:16.857 --> 54:19.462
get my hopes up, Hal.

54:19.497 --> 54:21.464
You couldn't even check the
message.

54:21.499 --> 54:25.369
You just started dancing
around like a fat fool!

54:25.738 --> 54:27.767
You broke my gun.

54:27.802 --> 54:30.770
We lost our food because of you!

54:30.805 --> 54:33.069
How could anybody be so stupid

54:33.104 --> 54:35.071
and yet still be alive?!

54:35.106 --> 54:36.776
You've gotta be the most hapless
oaf

54:36.811 --> 54:38.745
I've ever seen in my life!

54:42.883 --> 54:45.521
Stop it! Hal, stop!

54:52.423 --> 54:55.498
I shouldn't be here.

54:55.533 --> 54:57.830
I want to go home.

54:59.636 --> 55:01.603
I want to go home!

55:03.101 --> 55:07.378
None of this was supposed to
happen...

55:07.413 --> 55:10.513
What was I thinking?

55:30.568 --> 55:32.062
We can't build a boat!

55:32.097 --> 55:34.702
Haven't you seen what's out
there?
We'd never make it!

55:34.737 --> 55:35.670
We're trapped!

55:35.705 --> 55:36.738
It's our only option.

55:36.773 --> 55:39.608
Would you rather die here
or trying to find help?!

55:39.643 --> 55:41.775
There's no one out there to help
us!

55:41.810 --> 55:43.777
It's up to us to make it back!

55:43.812 --> 55:45.779
You put me in charge, remember?

55:45.814 --> 55:47.649
Or do you think you can do
better?

55:47.684 --> 55:49.882
Tyl might listen to you, but I'm
not.

55:49.917 --> 55:52.522
I'm not going out there!
I'm not making a boat!

55:52.557 --> 55:53.952
Then you can live on your own.

55:53.987 --> 55:57.725
If you're not working
I'm kicking you out of my camp!

55:57.760 --> 55:59.595
This wouldn't be such a problem

55:59.630 --> 56:01.597
if you hadn't murdered our only
Astronomer!

56:03.634 --> 56:05.964
Hey!

56:11.840 --> 56:15.006
You look like shit.

56:15.712 --> 56:18.075
What's going on?

56:21.179 --> 56:23.652
Here that long, huh?

56:24.354 --> 56:27.557
Any more ideas how we got here?

56:30.694 --> 56:32.463
No.

56:32.498 --> 56:34.465
There is

56:34.500 --> 56:36.731
one other option.

56:36.999 --> 56:38.931
Every year the Board of
Governors

56:38.966 --> 56:42.033
sends out a judge in each team
to observe.

56:42.368 --> 56:44.640
No one ever knows about it.

56:44.675 --> 56:47.170
The judges pick a contestant
from every team,

56:47.205 --> 56:49.205
make sure they can trust him,

56:49.540 --> 56:53.011
and assign him to report back on
the games.

56:53.046 --> 56:56.718
Sometimes I bet they even rig
it.

57:00.625 --> 57:02.790
How'd you find this out?

57:02.825 --> 57:05.595
I talked it out of someone last
year.

57:06.928 --> 57:08.059
Now.

57:08.094 --> 57:10.930
No one can come home till
someone's won.

57:11.165 --> 57:13.504
These judges do it all the time.

57:13.539 --> 57:16.606
Pop home to report then slip
right back.

57:16.641 --> 57:18.608
Say they'd gone to
the bathroom or something.

57:18.643 --> 57:21.138
I know how to contact the Gate
Ops.

57:21.540 --> 57:23.877
Tell 'em you're a student judge,

57:23.912 --> 57:25.648
and they'll bring you home.

57:25.683 --> 57:27.650
If you were right

57:27.685 --> 57:29.652
I would have heard about it.

57:29.687 --> 57:31.786
How can we believe you?

57:31.821 --> 57:34.019
Because Shrimp,

57:34.588 --> 57:37.528
that's how I got home first.

57:37.930 --> 57:40.597
That's how I cheated.

57:40.632 --> 57:42.225
I told the Slip Gate Operators

57:42.260 --> 57:43.534
that I was a judge.

57:43.569 --> 57:45.800
When I came out I raised my
scope

57:45.835 --> 57:48.033
and said I'd found Sol.

57:48.635 --> 57:51.135
The Gate Ops don't talk but

57:51.170 --> 57:53.269
the judges figured it out.

57:53.304 --> 57:56.140
There's no way to contact home
or I'd have done it.

57:56.175 --> 57:57.812
There's one.

57:57.847 --> 58:01.651
That Hyperion ship
still has a working core.

58:01.686 --> 58:04.115
Your scope is programmed for the
Gate Ops.

58:04.150 --> 58:05.820
If you run it through the ship

58:05.855 --> 58:07.184
it'll let you call for a
pick-up.

58:07.219 --> 58:08.889
No.

58:09.826 --> 58:11.826
The control element's missing.

58:11.861 --> 58:14.092
We'd never find it out here.

58:17.900 --> 58:20.065
You knew a way home

58:20.100 --> 58:21.803
and you didn't tell us?

58:21.838 --> 58:23.640
What were you waiting for?!

58:23.675 --> 58:25.741
When they realize we cheated
they'll come after us

58:25.776 --> 58:27.743
with everything they have.

58:27.778 --> 58:30.141
We'd be better off staying here.

58:30.376 --> 58:32.242
You made it back...

58:32.277 --> 58:33.914
It took

58:33.949 --> 58:37.720
everything my family had to get
me back in.

58:39.691 --> 58:41.658
I'd never do it again either.

58:41.693 --> 58:43.957
If not for all this.

58:43.992 --> 58:46.223
But look at all that's happened.

58:46.491 --> 58:48.632
Wouldn't they understand?

58:48.667 --> 58:50.095
Believe me,

58:50.130 --> 58:52.603
they won't care.

58:52.905 --> 58:55.001
If you try and explain
beforehand

58:55.036 --> 58:56.640
you'll just blow your cover.

58:56.675 --> 58:58.268
Is it really that bad?

58:58.303 --> 59:00.270
When you stand before them

59:00.305 --> 59:03.746
and see your entire future
slipping away.

59:05.112 --> 59:07.376
Remember how you felt today.

59:07.411 --> 59:09.378
Cause whoever gives them their
name

59:09.413 --> 59:12.590
that's the one they'll come
after worst.

59:13.021 --> 59:15.153
He's done.

59:16.024 --> 59:17.694
We'll do it.

59:17.729 --> 59:19.355
No.

59:19.390 --> 59:21.027
No we won't.

59:21.062 --> 59:23.029
I'm in charge now remember?

59:23.064 --> 59:25.636
I just want to go home.

59:25.671 --> 59:26.901
More than anything.

59:26.936 --> 59:28.199
I'm sorry. I am.

59:28.234 --> 59:30.168
I want to go home too
but there's another way

59:30.203 --> 59:32.203
off this planet and I'm gonna
find it.

59:32.238 --> 59:36.042
You can't have the scope. I'm
sorry.

59:36.913 --> 59:37.978
Wait, Lex-

59:38.013 --> 59:39.683
No!

1:00:16.348 --> 1:00:18.315
Where's the scope?!

1:00:18.350 --> 1:00:19.415
It's gone!

1:00:19.450 --> 1:00:21.252
Could he have gone to look for
Sol?

1:00:21.287 --> 1:00:22.385
We gotta find him!

1:00:22.420 --> 1:00:24.255
He could be anywhere by now. How
can we-

1:00:24.290 --> 1:00:26.257
Quiet!

1:00:26.292 --> 1:00:28.798
Listen.

1:00:31.697 --> 1:00:34.870
Your camera's still connected to
it.

1:00:36.874 --> 1:00:39.171
I see something.

1:00:39.877 --> 1:00:41.844
Hal? Hal?

1:00:41.879 --> 1:00:44.044
Hal, what's going on!?

1:00:45.949 --> 1:00:47.212
I'm taking the scope.

1:00:47.247 --> 1:00:49.082
I won't let your ruin this. I'm
going home!

1:00:49.117 --> 1:00:51.381
But we need the scope.
You can't just take it!

1:00:51.416 --> 1:00:53.383
You know we'll never find Sol!

1:00:53.418 --> 1:00:56.254
But at least if I call home
we can finally leave.

1:00:56.289 --> 1:00:59.422
What about us?
Somebody has to take the fall!

1:00:59.457 --> 1:01:01.160
Don't we get a say in it?!

1:01:01.195 --> 1:01:02.359
I'm sorry,

1:01:02.394 --> 1:01:04.834
but I don't care about the
tournament.

1:01:04.869 --> 1:01:06.165
I can live with the
consequences,

1:01:06.200 --> 1:01:08.365
my family needs me home.

1:01:08.400 --> 1:01:09.773
You wouldn't understand.

1:01:09.808 --> 1:01:10.841
It's easy for you to talk big

1:01:10.876 --> 1:01:13.040
when you're the one
running with our telescope!

1:01:13.075 --> 1:01:14.305
What would you know?

1:01:14.340 --> 1:01:16.472
I'm doing it to help someone.

1:01:16.507 --> 1:01:17.979
You guys have never thought

1:01:18.014 --> 1:01:20.014
about anybody but yourselves!

1:01:20.412 --> 1:01:21.818
No...

1:01:25.850 --> 1:01:27.252
Hal! Do you have a light?

1:01:27.287 --> 1:01:29.518
You need to get back to camp.
Hurry!

1:01:29.553 --> 1:01:31.355
I think I hear something.

1:01:31.390 --> 1:01:33.258
Where are you, Hal?

1:01:33.293 --> 1:01:34.930
I'm in the forest.

1:01:34.965 --> 1:01:36.767
That's their forest.
That's where they live!

1:01:36.802 --> 1:01:39.198
Listen! Hide.
We're coming for you right now.

1:01:41.367 --> 1:01:42.872
Hal, run!

1:02:01.090 --> 1:02:03.090
You had your chance!

1:02:03.125 --> 1:02:05.323
You don't know what you're
doing!

1:02:05.358 --> 1:02:07.930
Why should we trust you now?

1:02:09.494 --> 1:02:12.099
Because I know what to do.

1:02:14.169 --> 1:02:16.400
I'm getting us home.

1:02:17.106 --> 1:02:19.106
It's Tyl's team.

1:02:19.141 --> 1:02:21.471
I'm with him.

1:02:36.961 --> 1:02:39.390
If I do this,

1:02:39.425 --> 1:02:43.064
do you promise you'll get us
home?

1:02:46.498 --> 1:02:49.367
I promise.

1:02:59.214 --> 1:03:01.951
It's not safe to split up.

1:03:01.986 --> 1:03:04.349
We'll just have to comb the
whole forest.

1:03:10.456 --> 1:03:13.325
No point delaying the
inevitable.

1:03:41.388 --> 1:03:44.257
It's quiet here.

1:03:44.292 --> 1:03:46.897
I don't like it.

1:04:00.242 --> 1:04:02.572
There it is.

1:04:04.213 --> 1:04:06.917
Let's make a break for it.

1:04:06.952 --> 1:04:08.314
Wait.

1:04:08.349 --> 1:04:11.317
Whatever did this could still be
here.

1:04:56.199 --> 1:04:57.968
The telescope!

1:04:58.003 --> 1:04:59.200
Is it okay?!

1:04:59.235 --> 1:05:00.399
It's fine!

1:05:00.434 --> 1:05:02.434
But look...

1:05:11.511 --> 1:05:13.313
I think-

1:05:13.348 --> 1:05:16.349
I think they took Hal down
there.

1:05:18.683 --> 1:05:20.254
Can you see anything?

1:05:20.289 --> 1:05:22.091
There are tunnels inside.

1:05:22.126 --> 1:05:23.752
Long ones...

1:05:23.787 --> 1:05:26.359
I can't see the ends.

1:05:26.994 --> 1:05:30.330
It must be where they go during
the day.

1:05:30.365 --> 1:05:32.761
There could be a whole world
down there.

1:05:32.796 --> 1:05:35.434
Even bigger than the island.

1:05:36.635 --> 1:05:40.340
Then let's keep it down there.

1:05:46.150 --> 1:05:48.645
This is the only way out.

1:05:49.747 --> 1:05:52.088
Are you sure?

1:05:52.390 --> 1:05:55.190
Unless those things can fly.

1:05:59.328 --> 1:06:02.065
Do you think it'll be able to
stop 'em?

1:06:03.563 --> 1:06:06.168
I don't know.

1:06:18.809 --> 1:06:21.315
Stop! Listen!

1:06:22.252 --> 1:06:24.516
They're not coming!

1:06:30.623 --> 1:06:33.129
It worked.

1:06:33.164 --> 1:06:35.098
It works!

1:06:35.633 --> 1:06:38.200
Are we sure it'll last all
night?

1:06:38.532 --> 1:06:40.466
I hope.

1:06:40.501 --> 1:06:42.468
We'll have to keep the fire
going.

1:06:42.503 --> 1:06:43.799
I'll take tomorrow.

1:06:43.834 --> 1:06:46.241
Then Lex. Then you, Kit.

1:06:46.276 --> 1:06:48.441
We'll keep them trapped forever.

1:06:49.840 --> 1:06:51.807
I wonder if they'll start to eat
each other

1:06:51.842 --> 1:06:54.282
when they realize they're never
leaving.

1:07:12.401 --> 1:07:15.534
Are you sure you're ready?

1:07:18.572 --> 1:07:21.276
Then let's go home.

1:07:45.599 --> 1:07:47.632
The core's still intact.

1:07:47.667 --> 1:07:49.766
All we need is the control
element.

1:07:49.801 --> 1:07:51.372
No.

1:07:51.640 --> 1:07:53.539
Not like this.

1:07:53.574 --> 1:07:55.145
I can't go home like that.

1:07:55.180 --> 1:07:57.609
It's time to go home!

1:08:22.306 --> 1:08:23.734
Tyl, that's not gonna work.

1:08:23.769 --> 1:08:25.439
Main power's offline.

1:08:26.706 --> 1:08:28.805
Then what can we do?

1:08:28.840 --> 1:08:30.708
I can do it.

1:08:30.743 --> 1:08:31.709
Let me try.

1:08:31.744 --> 1:08:33.315
One wrong wire

1:08:33.350 --> 1:08:35.317
and he could fry the whole
computer.

1:08:35.352 --> 1:08:38.749
If he ever wanted to
screw us over it would be now.

1:08:39.554 --> 1:08:41.488
Can you get it to work?

1:08:41.523 --> 1:08:42.322
No!

1:08:42.357 --> 1:08:44.722
I'm sorry but how can we trust
him?

1:08:44.757 --> 1:08:46.757
Because.

1:08:47.661 --> 1:08:49.925
He's better than that.

1:08:50.796 --> 1:08:53.401
Fix it.

1:09:34.312 --> 1:09:36.840
Slip Gate - Come in,
this is Slip Gate Control.

1:09:36.875 --> 1:09:37.774
Hello?

1:09:37.810 --> 1:09:39.843
Gate - Who's this? Identify
yourself.

1:09:39.878 --> 1:09:41.845
I'm a student judge in the
Sol Invictus games.

1:09:41.880 --> 1:09:43.847
Requesting immediate transit
back to Earth

1:09:43.882 --> 1:09:44.781
for a report.

1:09:44.817 --> 1:09:47.818
Gate - Sol Invictus? That was
weeks ago.

1:09:47.853 --> 1:09:49.556
We thought you were all dead.

1:09:49.591 --> 1:09:50.887
We're not.

1:09:50.922 --> 1:09:51.855
Not yet.

1:09:51.890 --> 1:09:53.021
Gate - I don't believe it.

1:09:53.056 --> 1:09:54.759
We need to get you back for
debrief.

1:09:54.794 --> 1:09:55.727
What's your name?

1:09:55.762 --> 1:09:56.695
My name?

1:09:56.730 --> 1:09:58.598
Gate - Every portal needs
a record on file

1:09:58.633 --> 1:10:02.338
for who authorized it.
Especially student judges.

1:10:02.373 --> 1:10:05.407
Give me your name.

1:10:05.709 --> 1:10:08.740
Kit. Kit of Capricorn.

1:10:08.775 --> 1:10:10.841
I take full responsibility.

1:10:10.876 --> 1:10:13.349
I need a portal back to Earth
immediately.

1:10:13.384 --> 1:10:14.746
The Gate here was damaged.

1:10:14.781 --> 1:10:16.319
I can't get a portal up.

1:10:16.354 --> 1:10:17.782
I need you to open one on your
end.

1:10:17.817 --> 1:10:19.520
We can still activate one from
Earth.

1:10:19.555 --> 1:10:21.456
All I need is your planet code.

1:10:21.491 --> 1:10:23.557
Give it to me and we'll
have you home by nightfall.

1:10:23.592 --> 1:10:24.756
Can't you tell me where I am?

1:10:24.791 --> 1:10:26.329
We don't know where you landed.

1:10:26.364 --> 1:10:27.759
Now we can open a portal

1:10:27.794 --> 1:10:30.399
but only if we know which one to
use.

1:10:30.434 --> 1:10:32.599
Without that there's
no way to get you home.

1:10:32.634 --> 1:10:34.062
Then open all the Gates in the
system!

1:10:34.097 --> 1:10:35.833
Do you have any idea how many
that is?

1:10:35.868 --> 1:10:37.736
The resources that would waste?!

1:10:37.771 --> 1:10:39.309
You know we can't do that.

1:10:39.344 --> 1:10:40.937
What about a rescue party?

1:10:40.972 --> 1:10:42.510
Can you send anyone?

1:10:42.545 --> 1:10:43.478
We can't.

1:10:43.513 --> 1:10:46.778
You could be in any corner of
the galaxy.

1:10:46.813 --> 1:10:49.451
What are you saying?

1:10:49.486 --> 1:10:51.453
You know what I'm saying.

1:10:51.488 --> 1:10:52.949
If we don't know what planet
you're on,

1:10:52.984 --> 1:10:55.424
there's nothing we can do.

1:10:55.459 --> 1:10:57.855
I know this is hard to hear

1:10:57.890 --> 1:10:59.923
but you're not coming home.

1:10:59.958 --> 1:11:01.463
I'm sorry.

1:11:01.498 --> 1:11:03.465
Gate Control out...

1:11:09.066 --> 1:11:11.836
We got so close...

1:11:12.138 --> 1:11:15.774
Now we're even further
than when we started.

1:11:15.809 --> 1:11:18.480
How could this have happened to
us?

1:11:18.682 --> 1:11:20.009
I'm sorry.

1:11:21.716 --> 1:11:23.749
I'm really sorry.

1:11:23.784 --> 1:11:26.081
We're never going home.

1:11:27.590 --> 1:11:29.755
What is home?

1:11:29.790 --> 1:11:31.790
This isn't.

1:11:32.092 --> 1:11:34.331
It could never be.

1:11:40.768 --> 1:11:42.834
The fire's almost out.

1:11:42.869 --> 1:11:44.869
Maybe you should put some wood
on it.

1:11:44.904 --> 1:11:46.904
What's the point?

1:11:47.808 --> 1:11:48.741
Where are you going?

1:11:48.776 --> 1:11:51.480
Does it even matter anymore?!

1:12:23.580 --> 1:12:26.174
My name is Tyl of Libra.

1:12:26.209 --> 1:12:28.176
The date?

1:12:28.211 --> 1:12:30.651
I don't even know.

1:12:30.686 --> 1:12:32.785
If you found this telescope then
you're

1:12:32.820 --> 1:12:34.490
probably stranded here too.

1:12:34.525 --> 1:12:36.085
If that's the case,

1:12:36.120 --> 1:12:39.429
then I'm sorry.

1:12:39.959 --> 1:12:41.563
My only advice is-

1:12:45.503 --> 1:12:47.866
No...

1:12:50.508 --> 1:12:53.575
Message- Eli?
Eli, I just saw your message.

1:12:53.610 --> 1:12:56.171
Where are you? What happened?

1:12:56.206 --> 1:12:58.173
We're so worried.

1:12:58.208 --> 1:13:00.208
Your father and I
have been trying to find you

1:13:00.243 --> 1:13:02.452
and no one will tell us
anything.

1:13:02.487 --> 1:13:04.080
They just said there was an
accident

1:13:04.115 --> 1:13:05.818
with the Slip Gates.

1:13:05.853 --> 1:13:07.490
We thought you were lost...

1:13:07.525 --> 1:13:10.053
I am so glad you're okay!

1:13:10.088 --> 1:13:12.220
We'll never give up on finding
you.

1:13:12.255 --> 1:13:15.795
Even if we have to search
every planet ourselves.

1:13:15.830 --> 1:13:17.863
We will find you.

1:13:17.898 --> 1:13:20.536
I'll see you soon, son.

1:13:20.571 --> 1:13:21.834
I love you.

1:13:23.970 --> 1:13:26.135
What do you want me to do?

1:13:26.170 --> 1:13:28.676
I don't know what to tell her!

1:13:28.711 --> 1:13:31.107
If I send a response...

1:13:32.649 --> 1:13:34.110
Wait...

1:13:34.512 --> 1:13:36.519
Send a response!

1:13:36.554 --> 1:13:37.817
Trace that message!

1:13:37.852 --> 1:13:40.050
Point of origin.

1:13:41.988 --> 1:13:43.955
Ignore!

1:13:46.795 --> 1:13:48.960
You're all the way over there?

1:13:58.609 --> 1:14:00.609
Oh come on!

1:14:08.278 --> 1:14:11.147
Not yet you're not! Come on!

1:14:46.217 --> 1:14:48.591
There you are...

1:14:49.693 --> 1:14:51.286
Wait.

1:14:51.321 --> 1:14:53.288
If you're Sol...

1:14:53.323 --> 1:14:56.533
You can be my reference point!

1:14:56.902 --> 1:14:59.635
Triangulate position.

1:14:59.670 --> 1:15:02.737
Point of reference.

1:15:02.772 --> 1:15:06.136
Using that star.

1:15:06.171 --> 1:15:09.711
As Sol...

1:15:17.149 --> 1:15:19.952
Cygnus B-7.

1:15:19.987 --> 1:15:22.317
Cygnus B-7!

1:15:24.992 --> 1:15:27.762
Gate - Gate Control.
Come in this is Gate Control.

1:15:27.797 --> 1:15:28.961
I'm a Sol contestant!

1:15:28.996 --> 1:15:30.259
I need immediate transit-

1:15:30.294 --> 1:15:31.964
Gate - Kid, I'm sorry.

1:15:31.999 --> 1:15:33.735
But unless you've got a planet
code

1:15:33.770 --> 1:15:34.802
I've got nothing else-

1:15:34.837 --> 1:15:36.804
Cygnus B-7!

1:15:36.839 --> 1:15:37.871
We're on Cygnus B-7!

1:15:37.906 --> 1:15:40.335
Gate - Cygnus B-7...

1:15:40.370 --> 1:15:42.337
Cygnus B-7?!

1:15:42.372 --> 1:15:43.844
You're all the way out there!?

1:15:44.079 --> 1:15:47.617
That's an H Class planet.
Unsafe for human habitation!

1:15:47.652 --> 1:15:48.651
How did you-

1:15:48.686 --> 1:15:49.949
Never mind! Listen!

1:15:49.984 --> 1:15:52.083
Get to the Slip Gate as fast as
you can.

1:15:52.118 --> 1:15:54.085
I just sent through the
activation command.

1:15:54.120 --> 1:15:55.691
A portal will be up soon.

1:15:55.726 --> 1:15:57.121
Wait! You gotta delay it!

1:15:57.156 --> 1:15:58.628
I have to find my friends first!

1:15:58.663 --> 1:16:00.861
That gate's not stable
enough to hold for long!

1:16:00.896 --> 1:16:03.765
A few minutes tops
and it's gonna collapse for
good!

1:16:03.800 --> 1:16:06.229
Come home now while you still
can!

1:16:25.520 --> 1:16:27.855
Take Adrian and get to the Slip
Gate!

1:16:27.890 --> 1:16:29.219
What about you?!

1:16:29.254 --> 1:16:31.254
I gotta find Lex!

1:16:43.202 --> 1:16:44.971
We don't have any time! You go
ahead!

1:16:45.006 --> 1:16:46.973
No! We're all going home!

1:16:47.008 --> 1:16:48.337
Give him to me!

1:16:48.372 --> 1:16:50.372
Go!

1:16:57.315 --> 1:16:59.282
Let's go! Hurry!

1:17:03.156 --> 1:17:04.892
Did you hear that?

1:17:04.927 --> 1:17:06.091
Don't worry about it!

1:17:06.126 --> 1:17:07.224
They do that every night

1:17:07.259 --> 1:17:09.292
when they're burned by the fire!

1:17:09.327 --> 1:17:11.459
Should be ready in a few
minutes!

1:17:12.935 --> 1:17:14.935
Wait!

1:17:16.774 --> 1:17:19.071
That one didn't come from the
forest.

1:17:19.106 --> 1:17:21.073
How did they-

1:17:22.340 --> 1:17:23.845
Kit! You didn't-

1:17:23.880 --> 1:17:25.715
I'm sorry!

1:17:25.750 --> 1:17:27.915
I didn't think we'd make it.

1:17:27.950 --> 1:17:29.917
It's not gonna form in time!

1:17:31.954 --> 1:17:34.185
If we run we might
be able to get away from them!

1:17:34.220 --> 1:17:35.483
The portal's gonna collapse!

1:17:35.518 --> 1:17:37.089
It can't re-open after this!

1:17:37.124 --> 1:17:39.993
We can try and fix it
later but right now we have to-

1:17:41.293 --> 1:17:42.226
Run!

1:17:42.261 --> 1:17:43.425
No!

1:17:43.460 --> 1:17:45.867
We're not running anymore!

1:17:45.902 --> 1:17:46.967
You're going home.

1:17:47.002 --> 1:17:47.902
What?!

1:17:47.937 --> 1:17:49.101
No we can't leave you!

1:17:49.136 --> 1:17:50.839
I'll buy you some time.

1:17:50.874 --> 1:17:52.203
Take Adrian with you.

1:17:52.238 --> 1:17:54.436
Take Adrian!

1:17:55.912 --> 1:17:57.912
Take it!

1:18:00.510 --> 1:18:01.949
Go home.

1:18:01.984 --> 1:18:03.313
What are you doing, Tyl?!

1:18:03.348 --> 1:18:06.151
Have you even thought about
this?!

1:18:13.061 --> 1:18:15.358
Go home, guys.

1:19:47.386 --> 1:19:49.991
- Here we stand,

1:19:50.026 --> 1:19:52.961
on the shoulders of giants.

1:19:53.263 --> 1:19:55.260
These are our words.

1:19:55.295 --> 1:19:57.867
And our sacred charge.

1:19:58.603 --> 1:20:01.596
Greatness is the foundation of
our world.

1:20:01.831 --> 1:20:05.105
Greatness let us survive
centuries of strife.

1:20:05.140 --> 1:20:07.371
Tame the physical world to our
will.

1:20:07.406 --> 1:20:09.472
And spread across the stars

1:20:09.507 --> 1:20:12.541
at the speed of light.

1:20:12.576 --> 1:20:16.248
That same greatness may be in
you.

1:20:16.283 --> 1:20:19.251
Now, it's time to find out...

1:20:44.245 --> 1:20:48.643
Welcome to Sol Invictus...
