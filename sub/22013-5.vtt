WEBVTT

00:01.235 --> 00:03.404
You're witnessing
the power of Empire.

00:03.437 --> 00:05.906
I'm Cookie Lyon, baby.
I'm unforgettable.

00:05.939 --> 00:07.675
Catch all-new episodes
Wednesdays.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
And check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.243 --> 00:12.012
Star, The Gifted,
and Lethal Weapon.

00:12.046 --> 00:14.548
That was the best idea
you've had all day.

00:14.582 --> 00:15.749
Only on Fox.

00:18.619 --> 00:20.488
-Previously on Empire...
-Lucious, what are you doing?

00:20.521 --> 00:22.256
(sighs)
It relaxes me.

00:22.290 --> 00:23.891
He only ever comes here
with Eddie.

00:23.924 --> 00:25.593
-Eddie?
-Eddie Barker.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.428
You don't know
the great super producer?

00:27.461 --> 00:28.929
He doesn't remember me, Cook.

00:28.962 --> 00:30.264
He has a traumatic brain injury.

00:30.298 --> 00:31.732
He can't remember anything.

00:31.765 --> 00:33.834
While Lucious continues
his sabbatical,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.869
we will produce and release
a new album

00:35.903 --> 00:38.706
for every year we have been
in operation.

00:38.739 --> 00:40.174
They work fast.

00:40.208 --> 00:42.176
The final edition
will be lethal.

00:42.210 --> 00:44.445
You can choose a different path
right now.

00:44.478 --> 00:47.181
-Would you come with me?
-Yes.

00:47.215 --> 00:49.350
Angelo is here as my attorney.

00:49.383 --> 00:52.453
I am suing for sole custody
of Bella.

00:54.054 --> 00:55.856
Listen, we have two days
until your hearing,

00:55.889 --> 00:58.359
so take me through this
one more time.

00:58.392 --> 01:02.596
Ms. Calhoun, Bella's mom,
was engaged to your father?

01:02.630 --> 01:04.732
-Yes.
-No. He had already broke it off

01:04.765 --> 01:05.966
with her before they hooked up.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.301
I would like to hear
Hakeem tell it.

01:07.335 --> 01:09.103
Oh, you want to hear Hakeem
tell you

01:09.137 --> 01:10.971
how he played hisself from jump?

01:11.004 --> 01:12.473
THIRSTY: Listen,
Skip is the best custody lawyer

01:12.506 --> 01:14.475
in the city-- just answer him.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.110
Go ahead, Hakeem.
Tell 'em.

01:16.144 --> 01:17.945
All right, look, me and Anika,
we hooked up as payback.

01:17.978 --> 01:20.214
But we both was mad at my father
at the time.

01:20.248 --> 01:23.151
-Right, Mom?
-Yes, boy.

01:23.184 --> 01:24.485
The second time...

01:24.518 --> 01:27.221
-Oh... so there was more
than one. -COOKIE: Oh...

01:27.255 --> 01:29.723
you think I was being sarcastic
for no reason?

01:29.757 --> 01:33.794
I was messed up in the head.
Things wasn't going good.

01:33.827 --> 01:36.230
Then I found out she was
pregnant six months later.

01:36.264 --> 01:37.798
THIRSTY: Yeah, too late
to do anything about it,

01:37.831 --> 01:39.099
if you know what I mean.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.734
Yo, Thirsty, watch how you talk
about Bella, man.

01:40.768 --> 01:42.803
-Calm down. -Relax, young Simba,
that's not what I meant.

01:42.836 --> 01:44.905
All right, and you
and Ms. Brown here

01:44.938 --> 01:47.007
have been raising the child?

01:47.040 --> 01:49.843
Yes. Well, only while
Anika was locked up.

01:49.877 --> 01:52.980
But it's not like I'm trying
to be her mother or anything.

01:53.013 --> 01:54.915
HAKEEM: And Bella's now totally
attached to Tiana.

01:54.948 --> 01:57.351
She hardly knows Anika.

01:57.385 --> 01:58.919
(phone chiming)

01:58.952 --> 02:02.456
Porsha, what?
I'm in a meeting.

02:02.490 --> 02:05.426
What?

02:05.459 --> 02:06.460
Okay.

02:06.494 --> 02:10.331
Somebody turn on TMZ.

02:10.364 --> 02:12.366
MAN (on TV): Years of
struggling and straining.

02:12.400 --> 02:13.767
*

02:13.801 --> 02:16.637
Now we come to the lowdown
on Lucious Lyon,

02:16.670 --> 02:19.039
who is getting ready to
celebrate the 20th anniversary

02:19.072 --> 02:20.674
of Empire.
According to reports,

02:20.708 --> 02:23.811
he has been suffering
from post-traumatic amnesia.

02:23.844 --> 02:26.380
CHARLES: Yeah, we're hearing
he doesn't remember his sons

02:26.414 --> 02:28.616
or even his ex-wife,
Cookie Lyon,

02:28.649 --> 02:30.451
and he's been lying about it
for months.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.386
So he has been defrauding, uh,

02:32.420 --> 02:34.555
all of the Empire shareholders?

02:34.588 --> 02:36.490
CHARLES: Uh, kind of like
a black Bernie Madoff.

02:36.524 --> 02:38.158
The guy's already lost a leg.

02:38.192 --> 02:39.993
Uh, if he's playing
with people's money,

02:40.027 --> 02:42.363
he is about to lose
something else.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.705
Morning, Detective.

02:56.444 --> 02:58.312
Oh...

02:58.346 --> 03:01.349
I did not mean
to spend the night.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.051
Yeah, it was a really big
imposition.

03:04.084 --> 03:06.053
Mm.

03:07.288 --> 03:10.558
This, we're not doing.

03:10.591 --> 03:12.426
We are not doing sleepovers.

03:12.460 --> 03:16.397
Absolutely right.
Get out.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.466
Well, since I'm here...

03:21.134 --> 03:22.636
(phone vibrates)

03:26.374 --> 03:28.208
I was just going
to hand it to you.

03:28.242 --> 03:29.577
Now you don't have to.

03:36.717 --> 03:38.419
Something about
my father's case?

03:38.452 --> 03:41.955
Now, you know I can't
talk to you about that.

03:41.989 --> 03:43.791
Well, you're doing a lot
of things that you, uh,

03:43.824 --> 03:45.459
shouldn't be doing.

03:45.493 --> 03:47.361
I guess we both just like

03:47.395 --> 03:50.298
to live on the edge,
now, don't we?

03:52.900 --> 03:55.803
And I'm not talking to you
about your father's case,

03:55.836 --> 03:59.973
unless, of course, there's
something you want to confess.

04:01.575 --> 04:03.076
Hmm.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.557
Dwight, I...

04:16.590 --> 04:19.327
I crossed a line with you.

04:19.360 --> 04:23.631
And I really need to get
a handle on my feelings.

04:23.664 --> 04:25.132
Why?

04:25.165 --> 04:28.168
Because it's... (sighs)
unprofessional.

04:28.201 --> 04:31.238
Some would say unethical.

04:31.271 --> 04:32.673
And if anybody were
to find out...

04:32.706 --> 04:35.476
Like who? Cookie?

04:35.509 --> 04:37.445
You're worried she's going
to find out about this?

04:37.478 --> 04:39.279
N-No, I'm not afraid of Cookie.

04:39.313 --> 04:41.782
(groans)
This...

04:43.317 --> 04:46.654
...it's just, um...

04:46.687 --> 04:47.921
it's my commitment,

04:47.955 --> 04:50.758
it's my responsibility.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.460
My sole purpose for being here

04:52.493 --> 04:54.428
is to help you recover
your memory.

04:54.462 --> 04:57.865
I owe that to you.
I owe it to your family.

04:57.898 --> 05:00.901
I want to remember, but...

05:05.573 --> 05:09.209
...then again,
I don't want to remember.

05:09.242 --> 05:13.213
I think the reason
I'm so conflicted

05:13.246 --> 05:15.916
is I want to help you
recover your memory...

05:18.251 --> 05:20.120
...but I want to help you
to become the man

05:20.153 --> 05:22.456
you want to be.

05:22.490 --> 05:25.793
I want to help you
to become Dwight.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.229
Is there...

05:29.262 --> 05:31.532
is there anything about Lucious

05:31.565 --> 05:35.235
you think you could embrace?

05:35.268 --> 05:38.038
His music.

05:39.840 --> 05:42.242
Lucious, we have us a problem.

05:42.275 --> 05:46.046
And I bet you that bitch Anika
leaked the damn story.

05:46.079 --> 05:48.382
Wait a minute, you paid her
$25 million.

05:48.416 --> 05:50.117
Well, that's what it got us.

05:52.052 --> 05:54.688
Then, good. Then nobody has
to pretend anymore.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.690
Lucious, yes, it is
a big problem, okay,

05:56.724 --> 05:59.593
because the board is up my ass.

05:59.627 --> 06:02.195
Okay, for months, I've been
fighting to protect

06:02.229 --> 06:04.765
the legacy you built,
but I can't do it anymore.

06:04.798 --> 06:07.367
So you're gonna have to come
with me and tell these people

06:07.401 --> 06:08.669
that this is fake news.

06:08.702 --> 06:09.670
Sorry, Claudia.

06:09.703 --> 06:11.572
No problem.

06:15.308 --> 06:17.377
*

06:23.951 --> 06:26.520
-(reporters clamoring)
-Lucious! -Mr. Lyon!

06:26.554 --> 06:30.090
Uh, I may need you to make
a statement about his condition.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.460
As long as you don't
expect me to lie.

06:32.493 --> 06:33.594
Hello.

06:33.627 --> 06:35.295
MAN:
Morning.

06:35.328 --> 06:36.897
COOKIE:
Thank you.

06:36.930 --> 06:39.032
Shareholders are bombarding us
with questions.

06:39.066 --> 06:41.034
EDNA: Investors are
threatening to sue.

06:41.068 --> 06:42.470
And if we've been defrauding
our stockholders...

06:42.503 --> 06:44.304
No one's defrauding anyone here.

06:44.337 --> 06:45.973
Can you all just give us
a chance to speak?

06:46.006 --> 06:47.508
SHINE:
I want to hear Lucious speak.

06:49.342 --> 06:52.212
Seem like he been absent.
Like he's hiding.

06:52.245 --> 06:55.148
How you feeling, L?
Been back in the studio?

06:55.182 --> 06:59.286
Moonshine.
My dear old friend.

06:59.319 --> 07:02.089
It's not about friendship now.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.957
It's about you losing
your marbles,

07:03.991 --> 07:05.759
and my 25% percent
right along with it.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.394
Hey, okay, look, you wouldn't
have a percentage

07:07.427 --> 07:08.629
if it wasn't for Lucious,

07:08.662 --> 07:10.263
so if I was you,
I'd stay in my lane.

07:10.297 --> 07:12.099
LEONARD:
We just need straight answers.

07:12.132 --> 07:16.369
Lucious, what, exactly,
is your medical condition?

07:20.841 --> 07:25.646
I'm sorry,
I don't answer to you.

07:25.679 --> 07:28.982
Nor do I answer to you or
anybody else in this room.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.853
Now, the last time I checked,

07:32.886 --> 07:36.657
Empire's stock was worth more
than it's ever been,

07:36.690 --> 07:40.193
Thanks to sale of my catalog,
thanks to the kindness

07:40.227 --> 07:43.263
of someone who wanted
to blow me up.

07:43.296 --> 07:45.866
So, I think y'all can skip me

07:45.899 --> 07:48.268
with these questions.

07:48.301 --> 07:51.271
Okay, all right,
thank you, Lucious.

07:51.304 --> 07:52.640
So, are we done here?

07:52.673 --> 07:54.942
We'd still like
a medical evaluation.

07:54.975 --> 07:57.144
Bitch, I would like a medical
evaluation of everybody

07:57.177 --> 07:59.847
on this board, but I can't
have that, can I?

07:59.880 --> 08:02.516
You know what, we are too busy
running this Empire

08:02.550 --> 08:04.518
to do this with y'all.

08:04.552 --> 08:07.387
Lucious is here to oversee
the remixes

08:07.420 --> 08:10.023
for the first 20 For 20--
we don't have time for this.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.859
REPORTER: Mr. Lyon, can you give
a quick statement...?

08:11.892 --> 08:14.361
WOMAN: What are we gonna tell
those reporters, Cookie?

08:14.394 --> 08:18.398
What if I invite the press...

08:18.431 --> 08:20.568
to follow him for 48 hours?

08:20.601 --> 08:23.370
Hmm?
The album drops right on time.

08:23.403 --> 08:26.640
Will that be enough for everyone
to calm the hell down?

08:26.674 --> 08:28.075
-I guess so.
-That could be good.

08:28.108 --> 08:29.843
SHINE:
Seems risky.

08:29.877 --> 08:32.412
-Is that good for you, Lucious?
-Damn good.

08:32.445 --> 08:34.447
Looks like we got us a deal.

08:39.920 --> 08:44.057
* I think she love me, 'cause I
got the check on me *

08:44.091 --> 08:46.594
* Wan' spend the day
and flex on me *

08:46.627 --> 08:48.195
* Put a curse and hex on me

08:48.228 --> 08:50.998
* Scratch out my name,
put the "X" on me... *

08:51.031 --> 08:53.100
Sorry I can't get coffee
with you,

08:53.133 --> 08:56.436
but the board is freaking out,
my mom's rallying the troops.

08:56.469 --> 08:58.005
So I got to get my ass
in the studio.

08:58.038 --> 09:00.107
Ah, don't worry about it.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.575
That's what I love about
your family.

09:01.609 --> 09:03.276
Dave, you can drop me
right here

09:03.310 --> 09:05.512
and then drop Warren off
to his office.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.047
WARREN: Don't worry about it.
I'll get out with you.

09:07.080 --> 09:08.048
-I'm gonna catch the subway.
-All right.

09:08.081 --> 09:09.082
All right.

09:11.885 --> 09:14.021
Jamal, what luck.

09:14.054 --> 09:16.123
Now I don't have to worry
about talking my way inside.

09:16.156 --> 09:17.357
You dropped that.
Ah, got you.

09:17.390 --> 09:19.126
That's actually a subpoena.

09:19.159 --> 09:22.529
So I guess I'll be seeing you
at, uh, Bella's custody hearing.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.298
-Call security.
-Hey, easy. Easy now.

09:25.332 --> 09:27.067
You know you don't need
any more legal problems.

09:27.100 --> 09:28.435
Look, you gave him the subpoena,
so why don't you

09:28.468 --> 09:29.436
just get the hell out of here?

09:29.469 --> 09:31.104
Okay. Who is this,

09:31.138 --> 09:32.806
your latest rent boy?

09:32.840 --> 09:36.043
'Cause he's, uh, he's taller
and dumber than I thought.

09:36.076 --> 09:38.812
Okay, take care.

09:38.846 --> 09:41.414
Oh, shoot, I almost forgot.

09:41.448 --> 09:43.116
Have you ever wondered
how the press got

09:43.150 --> 09:45.819
all those dirty little
details about your pops?

09:49.189 --> 09:52.960
Your trick looks thirsty.

09:52.993 --> 09:55.829
-Jamal...
-Just ignore what he said.

09:55.863 --> 09:59.132
He's been salty since my mom
dropped his stupid ass.

10:02.502 --> 10:04.204
Good looking out.

10:06.606 --> 10:08.809
This is so risky, Cookie.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.410
I know that Dwight's gonna
want to do this

10:10.443 --> 10:11.411
because he cares
about his family...

10:11.444 --> 10:13.013
Wait, you go by Dwight now?

10:13.046 --> 10:14.848
Never mind, child.

10:14.882 --> 10:16.249
But he hasn't even reconnected
with his musicality.

10:16.283 --> 10:17.484
I don't even know if you know

10:17.517 --> 10:19.687
your way around
a recording studio.

10:19.720 --> 10:21.755
That's why Becky is here.
She can help him.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.423
-Becky?!
-Yeah, Becky.

10:23.456 --> 10:25.125
You want me to teach
Lucious Lyon

10:25.158 --> 10:27.427
how to produce music? How?

10:27.460 --> 10:29.162
-You are being so dramatic.
-Well,

10:29.196 --> 10:31.031
you don't really have
to teach me anything, Becky.

10:31.064 --> 10:34.001
I just need you
to navigate the room.

10:34.034 --> 10:35.602
Like a Sherpa.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.338
And the studio is our mountain.

10:38.371 --> 10:40.373
And what if I'm afraid
of heights?

10:40.407 --> 10:42.042
You've spent more time with him

10:42.075 --> 10:44.211
in the studio
than anyone, Becky, okay?

10:44.244 --> 10:45.713
Just give him a few tips
about how he rolls,

10:45.746 --> 10:47.948
and let us know it's safe
to bring the press in here.

10:47.981 --> 10:49.316
-Press?
-COOKIE: Exactly. Yes.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.951
Yes! You can do, you can do.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.619
CLAUDIA:
Okay, then, I think that I need

10:52.652 --> 10:54.287
to stick close by him this time.

10:54.321 --> 10:55.522
COOKIE: Okay, look, you may not
know how to lie,

10:55.555 --> 10:57.290
but Lucious is good at it.

10:57.324 --> 11:00.828
I don't care-- long as those
reporters buy it, I'm good.

11:00.861 --> 11:03.997
So, Bella's mother,
your one-time stepmother,

11:04.031 --> 11:07.034
was charged with the murder
of your father's brother?

11:07.067 --> 11:09.336
-Half brother. okay?
-THIRSTY: Look, FYI.

11:09.369 --> 11:12.039
Anika's lawyer, Angelo Dubois,

11:12.072 --> 11:13.140
he used to kick it
with Hakeem's mom.

11:13.173 --> 11:14.708
-(chuckles)
-Pretty.

11:14.742 --> 11:16.309
I can't make this up.
Just to add

11:16.343 --> 11:18.378
a little, you know,
gasoline to the fire.

11:18.411 --> 11:19.646
Look, man, I need your word
they're not gonna try

11:19.679 --> 11:21.214
to take my baby
away from me again.

11:21.248 --> 11:22.515
Well, any more
twisted relationships

11:22.549 --> 11:23.851
between your two families?

11:23.884 --> 11:25.418
Anything you're leaving out?

11:25.452 --> 11:26.920
I need to know everything.

11:28.889 --> 11:30.590
That's it.

11:30.623 --> 11:33.260
Then you have my word.

11:34.427 --> 11:35.495
ZOE:
That's great, Bella.

11:35.528 --> 11:37.765
Y'all been granted
access behind the scenes

11:37.798 --> 11:40.167
to get a sneak peak into
the mind of a musical genius.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.002
Oh, excuse me, Cookie.

11:42.035 --> 11:44.237
Uh, these are Lucious' top ten
choices for the album cover.

11:44.271 --> 11:46.339
Uh, narrow it down to three,

11:46.373 --> 11:48.909
-and make sure you get him
to sign off on it. -Copy.

11:48.942 --> 11:51.244
Oh, and you did
have him sign off

11:51.278 --> 11:53.113
on Titan and Delphine's remix?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.547
You mean the one you d...

11:54.581 --> 11:55.682
Hey.

11:55.715 --> 11:56.750
Yes.
(chuckles)

11:56.784 --> 11:58.952
-Yes, I did.
-Okay, so...

11:58.986 --> 12:01.188
our first 20 For 20
is a compilation

12:01.221 --> 12:03.023
of Lucious's number one hits.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.592
Who's ready to see history
be remade?

12:05.625 --> 12:07.227
-Oh, yeah.
-Follow me.

12:07.260 --> 12:09.329
-(Cookie chuckles)
-(door opens)

12:11.598 --> 12:15.969
* It's so hard to believe

12:16.003 --> 12:19.106
* That you're not here with me

12:20.673 --> 12:24.444
* I really missed my chance

12:24.477 --> 12:28.949
* It's so hard to understand

12:28.982 --> 12:32.786
* But now I'm wondering,
would you *

12:32.820 --> 12:37.124
* Let me try again?

12:37.157 --> 12:39.059
Wow.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.627
-Are you okay?
-* Do you remember me?

12:40.660 --> 12:42.395
I just realized something.

12:42.429 --> 12:44.397
* Do you still think of me?

12:44.431 --> 12:47.000
It's like a door opened up. Hmm.

12:47.034 --> 12:50.137
Okay. But do you remember
what we planned?

12:50.170 --> 12:52.639
* At night

12:52.672 --> 12:56.409
* Every time you dream...

12:56.443 --> 12:58.478
Veronica, stop.
Stop, stop, stop.

12:59.813 --> 13:01.248
(Lucious chuckles)

13:01.281 --> 13:04.684
That little part right there,
that deserves...

13:04.717 --> 13:06.619
that deserves all of your power.

13:06.653 --> 13:07.855
Not just some of it.

13:07.888 --> 13:09.957
Now, I need you to imagine

13:09.990 --> 13:12.625
that if, after all these years,

13:12.659 --> 13:16.830
if everything you've
ever sacrificed,

13:16.864 --> 13:20.633
of being able to sing
in front of the world,

13:20.667 --> 13:23.270
if this moment was going to be
taken away from you,

13:23.303 --> 13:27.040
because you didn't give it
everything you've got.

13:27.074 --> 13:29.609
And I need you to sing
like you're gonna lose it

13:29.642 --> 13:31.344
at this moment.

13:31.378 --> 13:33.646
REPORTER:
Knows his stuff.

13:33.680 --> 13:35.682
-REPORTER 2: It's incredible.
-REPORTER 3: Wow.

13:35.715 --> 13:38.218
BECKY:
That's his genius.

13:38.251 --> 13:42.189
Take her back to the beginning.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.557
Take her back.

13:44.591 --> 13:47.494
* Here I sit

13:47.527 --> 13:48.996
* All alone

13:49.029 --> 13:53.967
* Wondering what went wrong

13:54.001 --> 13:56.003
* It's so hard

13:56.036 --> 13:58.638
* To believe

13:58.671 --> 14:00.908
* That you're not here

14:00.941 --> 14:03.376
* With me.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.103
Getting greedy, aren't we?

14:30.137 --> 14:32.005
PAMELA:
Not so fast, big boy.

14:32.039 --> 14:33.573
I'm here on business.

14:33.606 --> 14:35.375
Ah, what kind of business?

14:35.408 --> 14:37.410
Your boy, Shine Johnson.

14:37.444 --> 14:39.412
-He's not my boy.
-Vegas Metro's

14:39.446 --> 14:42.682
got video cam footage
of him near the garage

14:42.715 --> 14:45.285
where your father was getting
his car detailed the night of.

14:45.318 --> 14:46.519
So?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.854
My father and Shine are friends.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.522
They go way back.

14:49.556 --> 14:52.792
Our investigation says
they're more like rivals.

14:52.825 --> 14:55.963
You know, they've had
their ups and downs.

14:55.996 --> 14:57.797
I highly doubt Shine
had anything to do

14:57.830 --> 14:59.632
with my father's car bombing.

14:59.666 --> 15:02.469
Well, that's what he said
when we questioned him today.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.205
I asked you about my dad's case,
and you got all tight-lipped.

15:05.238 --> 15:08.441
Why the sudden change?

15:08.475 --> 15:11.144
-He threw shade your way, Andre.
-Shade?

15:11.178 --> 15:12.245
I'm just giving you
an opportunity

15:12.279 --> 15:13.380
to get in front of it.

15:13.413 --> 15:14.982
Get in front of it?

15:15.015 --> 15:19.419
Look, I already told Vegas Metro
everything I know.

15:19.452 --> 15:21.054
Okay.

15:21.088 --> 15:22.755
You're in front of it, then.

15:23.991 --> 15:25.425
(sighs)

15:25.458 --> 15:27.494
-I got to get back to work.
-So soon?

15:34.501 --> 15:36.503
Yeah.

15:41.108 --> 15:42.675
Hey.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.614
BECKY: Tony and Jamal
are remaking "You Won't,"

15:47.647 --> 15:49.516
which was made famous
in the '90s

15:49.549 --> 15:51.651
by Lucious and Schoolly D.

15:51.684 --> 15:54.087
Uh, interesting choice
for Jamal.

15:54.121 --> 15:56.356
Uh, Lucious, do you still
stand by those lyrics?

15:56.389 --> 15:58.325
A lot of people find them
pretty offensive.

15:58.358 --> 15:59.492
LUCIOUS:
I stand behind everything

15:59.526 --> 16:01.294
I've ever done, lady.

16:01.328 --> 16:03.630
Yeah, you know what? We're
actually still working on it.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.932
So, Dad, maybe everybody could
come back a little bit later?

16:05.965 --> 16:07.200
Good idea. Okay.

16:07.234 --> 16:08.601
BECKY:
Oh, yeah, and you know what?

16:08.635 --> 16:10.503
Shine actually needs your ear
in studio three,

16:10.537 --> 16:12.472
-so why don't we all just go...
-Uh, Cookie,

16:12.505 --> 16:14.707
-I don't, um...
-What is the pr...?

16:14.741 --> 16:17.610
Uh, no problem.
Just Shine, maybe we can wait.

16:17.644 --> 16:20.347
-LUCIOUS: It's fine.
-Seems a little tense in here.

16:20.380 --> 16:23.683
Is there any truth to the rumors
about Lucious's memory?

16:23.716 --> 16:26.453
Oh, no, no. There's no truth
about any rumors.

16:26.486 --> 16:27.954
And if that's what
y'all are snooping around for,

16:27.987 --> 16:29.222
you're in the wrong place.
You know what?

16:29.256 --> 16:31.191
-Let's go. Let's go...
-Everyone,

16:31.224 --> 16:33.460
-just follow me. -Mm-hmm, don't
be cutting your eyes at me,

16:33.493 --> 16:34.494
little Annie.

16:34.527 --> 16:36.229
Come on.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.537
As we were.

16:44.571 --> 16:46.073
Hey.

16:46.106 --> 16:47.974
Remember, you would say,

16:48.007 --> 16:49.409
"What you got for me, Shine?"

16:49.442 --> 16:52.011
-Not "Moonshine." Shine. Okay?
-(stopper squeaks)

16:54.514 --> 16:56.516
You better not play me
in front of the press

16:56.549 --> 16:57.984
like you did in the boardroom.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.686
Only thing I'm playing
is the music, Cookie.

16:59.719 --> 17:03.490
Yeah, and it'd better
be good, Shine.

17:03.523 --> 17:05.525
Welcome.

17:05.558 --> 17:08.361
-What you got for me, Shine?
-You guys ready for this?

17:08.395 --> 17:10.930
Yes, we're on a deadline.

17:10.963 --> 17:12.432
Ant, turn me up.

17:12.465 --> 17:14.467
(beat starts playing)

17:24.211 --> 17:25.912
Let's go.

17:25.945 --> 17:28.881
* Black mask, red eyes,
green case, no face *

17:28.915 --> 17:31.184
* Cold heart, tribe on my mind

17:31.218 --> 17:32.619
* Got to take it back,
it's go time *

17:32.652 --> 17:35.722
* Black mask, red eyes,
green case, no face *

17:35.755 --> 17:38.558
* Cold heart, tribe on my mind,
got to take it back *

17:38.591 --> 17:41.594
* It's go time,
black mask, red eyes *

17:41.628 --> 17:43.363
* Green case, no face

17:43.396 --> 17:44.964
-* Cold heart, tribe on
my mind... * -CLAUDIA: Hey.

17:44.997 --> 17:46.966
I saw that.

17:46.999 --> 17:49.302
Tell me what you're seeing.

17:49.336 --> 17:51.904
* No face, cold heart, tribe on
my mind, got to take it back *

17:51.938 --> 17:53.573
-* It's go time...
-Red.

17:53.606 --> 17:57.244
Crimson red.

17:57.277 --> 17:59.312
Like blood.

17:59.346 --> 18:02.149
* These pigs done really
got beside they self... *

18:02.182 --> 18:03.383
Come on, L. Let's turn up!

18:03.416 --> 18:05.585
Just ignore him.

18:05.618 --> 18:07.587
Are you seeing any other colors?

18:07.620 --> 18:08.921
* But they's counterfeit...

18:08.955 --> 18:10.257
Come on, turn it off.

18:10.290 --> 18:11.991
Turn it off!

18:12.024 --> 18:13.993
-* From the last young brother
that they... * -(music stops)

18:16.296 --> 18:18.665
It's just anger with no purpose.

18:18.698 --> 18:21.501
Keep working on it, Shine,
and do better.

18:24.371 --> 18:26.606
I know what I'm doing, okay? I'm
going to get one of my people.

18:26.639 --> 18:29.842
Okay, Lucious, why don't you
work with Veronica, huh?

18:29.876 --> 18:30.910
You seem to be comfortable
with that.

18:30.943 --> 18:32.111
I-If I can just have

18:32.145 --> 18:33.313
a little bit of time
alone with him,

18:33.346 --> 18:34.747
I think I could really help.

18:34.781 --> 18:36.916
I-I know what
I need to do, okay?

18:36.949 --> 18:39.152
Uh, Lucious, you can't just...

18:39.186 --> 18:40.987
CLAUDIA: Okay, I said
I would stick close.

18:41.020 --> 18:43.256
I'm gonna bring him back.

18:43.290 --> 18:45.091
Uh, that's-that's-that's
off the record.

18:45.124 --> 18:46.693
Yeah, off the record. Delete.

18:46.726 --> 18:48.661
You heard him. He's bringing in
one of his O.G.s.

18:48.695 --> 18:49.896
Go get coffee, take a break.

18:52.699 --> 18:54.201
-ANDRE: Yeah, I say
we send them home. -COOKIE: No.

18:54.234 --> 18:55.535
Claudia promised
she would bring him back.

18:55.568 --> 18:57.103
Just give them
a couple of minutes.

18:57.136 --> 18:59.138
-All right? Patience.
-Look, I don't like

18:59.172 --> 19:01.708
to be the bearer of bad news,
but the board is saying that...

19:01.741 --> 19:03.543
Look, I don't give a damn
what the board says.

19:06.413 --> 19:08.448
-Okay, what is the board saying?
-(chuckles)

19:08.481 --> 19:10.517
If the album doesn't drop
as scheduled,

19:10.550 --> 19:12.151
and Empire takes another hit
in the press...

19:13.486 --> 19:14.687
...they're gonna ask you
to step down.

19:16.723 --> 19:18.325
Damn.

19:18.358 --> 19:21.361
Oh, if Lucious was here,
he could finesse those fools,

19:21.394 --> 19:24.697
and lace them tracks if he could
remember a damn thing.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.502
Okay, go ahead, send them home.

19:31.371 --> 19:34.307
-THIRSTY: That's the best you
can do at this point... -Just...

19:34.341 --> 19:36.008
-REPORTER: Hey, guys, look.
-(gasps)

19:36.042 --> 19:37.710
REPORTER 2:
Is that Eddie Barker?

19:37.744 --> 19:40.680
-I'm-a go check on Hakeem
and the lawyer. -Okay. Bye.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.848
REPORTER 2:
That's Eddie Barker.

19:41.881 --> 19:43.049
-Hey.
-COOKIE: Eddie.

19:43.082 --> 19:44.050
Hey.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.018
Hey.
(laughing): Hey.

19:46.052 --> 19:47.587
-Lucious told me we were going
to make some music. -Yes!

19:47.620 --> 19:49.389
I pushed off
my trip to Barbados.

19:49.422 --> 19:52.024
-Thank you. -And then meet me
in the conference room.

19:52.058 --> 19:53.192
He may not remember this place,

19:53.226 --> 19:54.761
but he knows
you care about it, so...

19:54.794 --> 19:56.863
LUCIOUS: I told y'all
I was bringing an O.G.

19:56.896 --> 19:59.031
See? I told you.

19:59.065 --> 20:00.600
I told you Lucious
was pulling together

20:00.633 --> 20:02.669
some of the most
incredible producers

20:02.702 --> 20:04.003
to finish this album.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.905
And only he could get
Eddie Barker

20:05.938 --> 20:07.507
back in the booth.

20:07.540 --> 20:09.676
I told Lu that I might need him
to nudge me a little bit

20:09.709 --> 20:10.710
'cause it's been a while
since I've been

20:10.743 --> 20:11.944
-back in the studio.
-(laughter)

20:11.978 --> 20:13.680
(quietly):
I love you so much for this.

20:13.713 --> 20:14.881
I love you, too. Come on.

20:14.914 --> 20:16.048
Let's go make some music.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.851
(overlapping chatter)

20:18.885 --> 20:20.620
COOKIE:
Tiana, baby.

20:20.653 --> 20:21.954
I would like for you
to meet Eddie Barker.

20:21.988 --> 20:24.023
He's gonna produce
your track with Lucious.

20:24.056 --> 20:27.694
Yo, Lucious Lyon
and Eddie Barker?

20:27.727 --> 20:30.129
All right, now, sit your ass
down, babe. That's enough.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.299
-Wow. -EDDIE: I love
your stuff, Tiana.

20:32.332 --> 20:34.033
I'm honored to be
working with you.

20:34.066 --> 20:35.935
Oh, my God. Um, seriously.

20:35.968 --> 20:37.370
Y-You're a legend.

20:37.404 --> 20:38.938
No, sweetheart, tonight,
it's all about

20:38.971 --> 20:40.640
this legend right here.

20:40.673 --> 20:42.309
What's the megahit
that we're gonna be remixing

20:42.342 --> 20:44.577
for this lovely, amazing woman?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.813
Um, actually,
Lucious is insistent

20:46.846 --> 20:49.582
on having Tiana and Hakeem
do "Hate the Game"

20:49.616 --> 20:50.783
from Paid in Cash, right?

20:50.817 --> 20:53.219
COOKIE:
Great, so where's Hakeem?

20:53.252 --> 20:55.154
Um, he needs a minute.

20:55.187 --> 20:56.823
He had, like, 136, though,

20:56.856 --> 20:59.158
so what's the problem?

20:59.191 --> 21:01.928
Uh, how about we hear your part
while we wait for Hakeem?

21:01.961 --> 21:03.162
You okay with that, Lu?

21:03.195 --> 21:04.764
Yeah, I mean, if you're good,
I'm good.

21:05.932 --> 21:07.166
-Jump in the booth?
-Cool.

21:07.199 --> 21:08.968
-(chuckles)
-(beat starts playing)

21:19.779 --> 21:23.616
* When you out here in the cold,
you can't trust a soul *

21:23.650 --> 21:26.453
* Got to play your cards,
you can never fold *

21:26.486 --> 21:29.622
* If you call yourself a man,
you got to hold your ground *

21:29.656 --> 21:33.660
* Make a plan and don't let
nobody hold you down... *

21:33.693 --> 21:35.962
Quiet as it's kept, this, uh,

21:35.995 --> 21:38.130
is one of Cookie's favorites.

21:38.164 --> 21:39.699
Ain't that right, Cook?

21:39.732 --> 21:41.834
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.603
* That gon' getcha killed...

21:43.636 --> 21:45.872
Look, don't be modest.

21:45.905 --> 21:48.508
Look, you've shared so much
with these fine people.

21:48.541 --> 21:51.978
Why not share
why this is your favorite?

21:52.011 --> 21:54.347
Well, because y'all always like
to give Lucious all the credit.

21:54.381 --> 21:55.815
I guess 'cause he's a man.

21:55.848 --> 21:57.517
But I pimped this bitch.
All of it.

21:57.550 --> 22:00.219
(laughter)

22:00.252 --> 22:02.188
* Because a pimp
gon' be a pimp *

22:02.221 --> 22:06.659
* A player gonna play the game

22:06.693 --> 22:09.228
* A pimp gon' be a pimp

22:09.261 --> 22:12.164
* Don't hate the player,
hate the game *

22:12.198 --> 22:14.967
* Don't hate the
player, hate the game *

22:15.001 --> 22:19.472
* Don't hate the player,
hate the game *

22:19.506 --> 22:22.875
* Don't hate the player, hate
the game *

22:22.909 --> 22:26.078
* Don't hate the player,
hate the game... *

22:26.112 --> 22:28.014
LUCIOUS:
I'm starting to understand

22:28.047 --> 22:30.517
what's happening
when I hear music.

22:32.552 --> 22:36.188
Yes, I know,
I know, I know, you said that.

22:36.222 --> 22:37.890
All right, let me call you back.

22:37.924 --> 22:40.192
A prostitute just wandered in.

22:40.226 --> 22:43.329
All right.
What do you want?

22:43.362 --> 22:45.064
Just what was you trying
to do out there, Angelo?

22:45.097 --> 22:47.567
-Blow my cover in front of
Jamal? -I was just making sure

22:47.600 --> 22:49.902
you were keeping your eyes
on the prize, cuz.

22:49.936 --> 22:52.405
Well, I don't need you
to do that, cuz.

22:52.439 --> 22:54.273
You know, you were looking
really passionate

22:54.306 --> 22:57.410
for a brother who's supposed
to pretend he's in love.

22:57.444 --> 23:00.246
Well, if I'm convincing you,
then I'm doing my job.

23:00.279 --> 23:02.048
You're sprung.
I'm telling Mama

23:02.081 --> 23:03.082
and then
you're gonna kick rocks.

23:03.115 --> 23:04.584
Ain't nobody afraid of your mama

23:04.617 --> 23:05.785
but your bitch ass.

23:05.818 --> 23:07.286
You're Mama's boy.

23:07.319 --> 23:09.956
You got the whole family
messed up, anyway.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.123
And you should be
helping me help...

23:11.157 --> 23:12.425
-(knocking at door)
-Diana! It's Hakeem Lyon.

23:12.459 --> 23:14.627
-We need to talk.
-Go.

23:14.661 --> 23:16.563
-(muttering): It ain't over.
-Go.

23:19.165 --> 23:20.399
Can I help you?

23:20.433 --> 23:21.601
No. I need to talk
to your mother.

23:21.634 --> 23:22.935
Ah, she's unavailable.

23:22.969 --> 23:24.303
Uh, does this drive-by

23:24.336 --> 23:27.139
have anything to do
with your custody hearing?

23:27.173 --> 23:29.308
Look, Hakeem,
do yourself a favor.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.578
Just grant Anika full custody.

23:31.611 --> 23:32.912
To hell with you.

23:32.945 --> 23:34.380
I'm a way better parent
than Anika.

23:34.413 --> 23:37.116
All right, well,
I guess you can blame your ego

23:37.149 --> 23:41.153
when you hear, uh, little Bella
calling some other dude "Daddy."

23:41.187 --> 23:42.589
Oh.

23:42.622 --> 23:44.256
(grunts)

23:44.290 --> 23:46.559
(Angelo laughs)

23:46.593 --> 23:48.828
Okay.

23:48.861 --> 23:50.497
Did you know that judges frown

23:50.530 --> 23:53.833
upon fathers that can't
really control their temper?

23:53.866 --> 23:55.134
Yeah, so,

23:55.167 --> 23:58.137
I'll see your dumb ass in court.

24:01.841 --> 24:04.143
SHINE:
I'll be home when I get ready.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.311
(chuckles)
All right.

24:05.344 --> 24:07.013
Stop blowing up my phone, woman.

24:07.046 --> 24:08.080
All right, I love you.

24:08.114 --> 24:09.849
Don't blow up my...

24:09.882 --> 24:10.883
You talking to the cops?!

24:11.951 --> 24:13.319
You trying to get shot?

24:13.352 --> 24:14.587
I'm not going down
for what you did, Shine.

24:14.621 --> 24:15.655
-What I did?
-Yeah, what you did.

24:15.688 --> 24:16.689
What we did!

24:19.659 --> 24:21.828
You the only one running around,
talking to the cops

24:21.861 --> 24:23.763
when they hemmed your ass up
a few weeks ago.

24:23.796 --> 24:26.365
You didn't talk
to the police today?

24:26.398 --> 24:29.468
Not today. Not yesterday.
Not ever!

24:29.502 --> 24:32.438
You confusing me with somebody
who talks to the police.

24:32.471 --> 24:35.274
Now boss up.

24:35.307 --> 24:38.144
And stop running around here,
scared like a little bitch.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.846
You're right.

24:41.881 --> 24:44.551
You're not pitting me
against my family anymore.

24:44.584 --> 24:47.687
You want to tell 'em
what we did?

24:47.720 --> 24:50.156
Tell 'em.

24:50.189 --> 24:51.724
SHINE:
Yo, Andre.

24:56.896 --> 25:00.032
Yo, Keem.
Uh, according to my dude,

25:00.066 --> 25:01.300
these passports right here,

25:01.333 --> 25:02.301
they'll take care of you
and baby girl,

25:02.334 --> 25:03.502
all right, man?

25:06.072 --> 25:07.707
And we got a jet on standby?

25:07.740 --> 25:10.042
-Yeah, gassed and ready.
-This card right here,

25:10.076 --> 25:11.811
that's the number for the dude
in Cuba.

25:11.844 --> 25:12.979
Call him when you get there.

25:13.012 --> 25:14.313
He'll take care of you guys.

25:14.346 --> 25:15.682
CHICKEN:
Look, man, once you flex,

25:15.715 --> 25:18.217
they can't bring you back.
No extradition.

25:18.250 --> 25:19.986
You're gonna be good.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.688
You and Bella.

25:34.967 --> 25:37.503
There she is.

25:37.536 --> 25:38.905
What's up?

25:38.938 --> 25:40.072
"What's up?"

25:40.106 --> 25:42.842
Why you been ignoring my texts?

25:42.875 --> 25:45.778
Hmm? What's going on?

25:45.812 --> 25:47.614
I'm going to Cuba with Bella, T.

25:47.647 --> 25:50.549
Cuba? Hakeem... is this a joke?

25:50.583 --> 25:52.785
'Cause I don't have time
for this.

25:52.819 --> 25:55.087
Look, if I don't leave now,
they'll take Bella for good.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.689
I want you to come with us.

25:56.723 --> 25:58.891
-Come inside, this sounds crazy.
-No, what's crazy

25:58.925 --> 26:01.293
was letting her get away with
taking Bella in the first place.

26:01.327 --> 26:02.729
She did it before,
she'll do it again, T.

26:02.762 --> 26:04.864
She who? Anika?

26:04.897 --> 26:09.235
Look, T, I know it's a lot
to ask for,

26:09.268 --> 26:13.439
but I can't be without Bella
or you.

26:17.009 --> 26:20.379
Please.
We'll leave in the morning.

26:20.412 --> 26:21.848
(cell phone chimes)

26:23.750 --> 26:25.584
They need me back in the studio.

26:25.618 --> 26:30.122
Look, um, let me wrap this up
and I'll cover for you.

26:30.156 --> 26:32.959
And I'll meet you
at the airport.

26:34.994 --> 26:36.929
You for real?

26:36.963 --> 26:38.297
Promise.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.032
I promise.

26:44.170 --> 26:46.138
-Don't leave without me, okay?
-All right, babe.

26:46.172 --> 26:47.406
(engine starts)

26:47.439 --> 26:49.375
(car door closes)

26:53.045 --> 26:56.816
* Baby, do you remember me?

26:56.849 --> 26:58.084
* Yeah

26:58.117 --> 27:00.920
* I'll do anything

27:00.953 --> 27:02.989
* To make you

27:03.022 --> 27:06.859
* Understand

27:06.893 --> 27:08.460
* Oh, that I'll...

27:08.494 --> 27:10.930
-You good, Lu?
-Yeah.

27:10.963 --> 27:12.999
EDDIE: I remember
when you wrote this song.

27:13.032 --> 27:14.500
Was right after Cookie
went away.

27:14.533 --> 27:16.468
* Again...

27:16.502 --> 27:20.406
You built this empire to show
Cookie how much you loved her.

27:21.473 --> 27:23.609
Listen to this.

27:23.642 --> 27:25.511
* Oh...

27:25.544 --> 27:27.046
EDDIE:
Feel the love

27:27.079 --> 27:28.514
just pouring
out of every, every note.

27:28.547 --> 27:30.983
* The same...

27:31.017 --> 27:32.151
I feel it.

27:32.184 --> 27:34.854
* Do you remember me?

27:34.887 --> 27:39.191
Was that good for you, Lucious?

27:39.225 --> 27:40.226
It's so beautiful, V.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.394
I felt every single note.

27:45.031 --> 27:46.833
Hey. Why don't you take a break?

27:46.866 --> 27:48.134
Grab yourself something to eat.

27:48.167 --> 27:49.568
I got to get these fools
out of here.

27:49.601 --> 27:51.537
They've heard enough already.

27:56.208 --> 27:59.378
Okay, well, that is that.

27:59.411 --> 28:01.981
Thank you for coming.
Write something good. All right.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.182
-REPORTER: Thank you.
-I got to get back to work.

28:03.215 --> 28:04.383
REPORTER 2:
Thank you.

28:04.416 --> 28:06.485
That was good, V.
That was beautiful.

28:06.518 --> 28:08.087
-Thanks. -We're gonna do it
one more time.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.521
Just-just fall into it,
trust your power.

28:09.555 --> 28:11.257
It's all right, it's coming.
It's there.

28:11.290 --> 28:13.292
-Let's do it.
-Just relax into it. Yeah.

28:24.436 --> 28:28.074
Why is it when I hear music,
I see color?

28:28.107 --> 28:30.376
Have you ever heard
of synesthesia?

28:30.409 --> 28:34.881
I want you to listen to this
and tell me what color you see.

28:34.914 --> 28:38.417
(piano ballad playing)

28:40.619 --> 28:43.222
Key of "G."

28:43.255 --> 28:44.824
Blue.

28:52.231 --> 28:54.901
This is my song.

29:02.641 --> 29:05.978
I'm holding my music in my hand.

29:06.012 --> 29:07.746
Yes, you are.

29:27.099 --> 29:28.868

Can you describe what it is?

30:03.202 --> 30:05.504
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

And what the hell
is going on in here?

30:11.077 --> 30:12.711
CLAUDIA:
He has synesthesia.

30:12.744 --> 30:14.613
I already know
about his amnesia.

30:14.646 --> 30:16.448
No, no, synesthesia.

30:16.482 --> 30:19.785
It's where he listens to music
and sees colors.

30:19.818 --> 30:21.787
His brain's been rewired.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.689

listening to no music.

30:23.722 --> 30:25.892
CLAUDIA: No, he asked me
to turn it off.

30:25.925 --> 30:27.326
The only music
he's listening to is

30:27.359 --> 30:29.761
the music in his head right now.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.599
COOKIE:
Lucious.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.735
Lucious?

No, that's not what
he's doing at all.

31:10.769 --> 31:13.539
I know that look in his eyes.

31:13.572 --> 31:15.507
He's not listening to music.

31:15.541 --> 31:18.610
He's making music.

31:29.121 --> 31:32.124
*

31:37.063 --> 31:39.398
* 'Cause you won't
bring me down *

31:39.431 --> 31:41.934
* I won't be pulled down

31:41.968 --> 31:44.370
* You won't push me out

31:44.403 --> 31:46.905
* You won't, you won't

31:46.939 --> 31:49.308
* Your words can't kill my joy

31:49.341 --> 31:51.543
* My light won't be destroyed

31:51.577 --> 31:54.913
* My love won't be ignored

31:54.947 --> 31:57.783
* And if there's
an eye for an eye *

31:57.816 --> 32:00.086
* It'll leave both men blind

32:00.119 --> 32:02.488
* Dr. King said it clearly

32:02.521 --> 32:05.157
* I know it's hard,
but believe me *

32:05.191 --> 32:07.926
* If we let go our faith

32:07.960 --> 32:10.762
* Love will never
win the race, no *

32:10.796 --> 32:12.498
* Peace and truth
is the healing *

32:12.531 --> 32:15.701
* Shed your light
on your enemy. *

32:18.704 --> 32:20.506
-(door opens)
-Well, there he is. (laughs)

32:20.539 --> 32:22.108
-Here I am.
-How you doing?

32:22.141 --> 32:23.575
-What's up, Uncle Eddie?
-All right. Ah.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.277
-How you doing, man?
-Good.

32:25.311 --> 32:27.313
So, that was almost
a complete reverse

32:27.346 --> 32:29.115
of Lucious's arrangement, right?

32:29.148 --> 32:30.682
Yes, sir. You like it?

32:32.951 --> 32:34.420
The track's cool.

32:34.453 --> 32:37.423
The lyrics, not so much.

32:37.456 --> 32:40.926
There's a difference
between a remix and a remake.

32:40.959 --> 32:43.329
I broke that song on the radio
for your dad 20 years ago.

32:43.362 --> 32:44.963
Yeah, but Uncle Eddie,
what am I supposed to do?

32:44.997 --> 32:46.365
I'm supposed
to sing lyrics like,

32:46.398 --> 32:47.966
uh, "Won't catch me
with no fairy"

32:48.000 --> 32:50.669
or "Shoot 'em down
like a sniper"?

32:50.702 --> 32:53.772
You youngsters still take
everything so literally.

32:53.805 --> 32:57.543
Your father wrote that song in
response to a political assault

32:57.576 --> 32:59.445
on hip-hop at that time.

32:59.478 --> 33:00.946
I know. I know.

33:00.979 --> 33:02.614
Tipper Gore was snatching
rappers' wigs

33:02.648 --> 33:04.450
in a congressional hearing.
Still...

33:04.483 --> 33:07.819
And Lu responded with that song,
using his voice

33:07.853 --> 33:11.390
as a declaration
of his right to free speech.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.492
Yeah, and free speech
does not have to be hateful.

33:13.525 --> 33:15.961
So with all due respect,
I'm not buying it.

33:15.994 --> 33:18.330
(laughs softly)

33:18.364 --> 33:20.166
You were always too smart
for your own damn good.

33:20.199 --> 33:21.367
(both laugh)

33:21.400 --> 33:23.235
All right, what about this?

33:23.269 --> 33:25.204
You make that

33:25.237 --> 33:28.074
the intention behind
your singing on that song.

33:28.107 --> 33:30.976
We lay in some of the tracks
from the hearing.

33:31.009 --> 33:35.647
And we make it clear that you're
commenting on free speech.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.283
I mean, that could be dope.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.252
Yeah.

33:40.286 --> 33:41.820
All right.
Damn you, Uncle Eddie.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.255
(both laugh)

33:43.289 --> 33:45.524
-Be waiting on that.
-All right, I got you.

33:45.557 --> 33:46.858
All right.

33:46.892 --> 33:49.728
We got work to do.

33:49.761 --> 33:51.597
(chuckles)

33:51.630 --> 33:53.299
*

33:55.934 --> 33:58.003
Lucious stayed up all night

33:58.036 --> 33:59.605
so that we could complete
this album.

33:59.638 --> 34:01.207
He went home exhausted.

34:01.240 --> 34:04.343
But as promised,
I present to you:

34:04.376 --> 34:06.312
Lucious Lyon, Memory.

34:08.914 --> 34:10.349
It's incredible.

34:10.382 --> 34:12.451
JAMAL:
And with this painting

34:12.484 --> 34:16.755
as the cover art for the first
of Empire's 20 For 20 albums

34:16.788 --> 34:18.357
produced by my father,

34:18.390 --> 34:19.458
we have been
exclusively launched

34:19.491 --> 34:21.293
on Empire XStream this morning.

34:21.327 --> 34:23.061
A whole 24 hours early.

34:23.095 --> 34:24.696
And based on our early tracking,
it's already set

34:24.730 --> 34:26.098
to break several records.

34:26.132 --> 34:28.066
Without spending one dime
on promotion,

34:28.100 --> 34:29.468
thanks to the nosy media.

34:29.501 --> 34:30.769
You're welcome.

34:30.802 --> 34:31.970
Well, according
to one of the bloggers

34:32.003 --> 34:34.206
you had up in here,

34:34.240 --> 34:37.976
and I quote, "Lucious
is not right in the head."

34:38.009 --> 34:39.578
Getting tired, Shine.

34:39.611 --> 34:41.079
(knocking on table)

34:41.113 --> 34:43.815
Um...

34:43.849 --> 34:46.818
I'm gonna be honest with you.

34:46.852 --> 34:50.222
Lucious is suffering from a TBI,

34:50.256 --> 34:51.657
a traumatic brain injury.

34:51.690 --> 34:54.426
But he has made
tremendous progress.

34:54.460 --> 34:58.264
Uh... This album is proof
of that progress.

34:58.297 --> 35:01.267
And he will be back
to 100% very soon.

35:01.300 --> 35:02.834
You have my word.

35:02.868 --> 35:04.102
EDNA:
We hope so, Cookie.

35:04.136 --> 35:06.972
And we appreciate your honesty,
finally.

35:07.005 --> 35:10.842
But we must protect this company
from stockholder liability.

35:10.876 --> 35:13.279
Given everything that's
happened, it's imperative

35:13.312 --> 35:15.247
that we bring in someone
from the outside.

35:15.281 --> 35:18.184
COOKIE: I knew you bitches
were gonna say that.

35:19.685 --> 35:20.852
(scoffs)

35:23.522 --> 35:28.194
I'm sure you all know
who the great Eddie Barker is.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.095
I don't need
to run down his résumé.

35:30.128 --> 35:32.498
He's one of the most revered
executives in the history

35:32.531 --> 35:34.333
-of the music business.
-Yes.

35:34.366 --> 35:36.502
Mm-hmm. Your mouth
is dropped. Pick it up.

35:36.535 --> 35:39.505
Since you don't want me
to do this alone,

35:39.538 --> 35:42.374
you got to have a man
standing over me or beside me,

35:42.408 --> 35:44.310
how about Eddie Barker?
He's family.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.711
'Cause, see,
what you're not gonna do

35:45.744 --> 35:48.013
is bring somebody from
the outside who's not family

35:48.046 --> 35:49.381
and force them on us.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.716
LEONARD:
Are you saying Mr. Barker

35:50.749 --> 35:53.452
would come on board at Empire?

35:53.485 --> 35:56.054
Eddie?

35:56.087 --> 35:57.689
I don't think
there's a person alive

35:57.723 --> 35:59.325
who could refuse this woman.

35:59.358 --> 36:00.626
In what capacity?

36:00.659 --> 36:03.362
Special advisor to your CEO,

36:03.395 --> 36:05.831
-Cookie Lyon.
-(applause)

36:05.864 --> 36:07.999
-That makes me very happy.
-That I can get on board with.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.235
-Yes.
-Amazing.

36:11.537 --> 36:13.138
(mouthing)

36:13.171 --> 36:15.006
(piano playing)

36:15.040 --> 36:16.174
LUCIOUS:
I need yellow.

36:16.208 --> 36:17.409
-I need yellow.
-Here.

36:17.443 --> 36:19.345
Here's some yellow.

36:20.912 --> 36:22.147
LUCIOUS:
Bring this in.

36:22.180 --> 36:24.049
Give me the red.

36:24.082 --> 36:25.517
Give me drums and give me bass.

36:25.551 --> 36:27.185
Do you hear that?
Do you see that?

36:27.219 --> 36:29.555
I want the strings
to come in just like that.

36:29.588 --> 36:31.690
Make sure it's strong.

36:31.723 --> 36:33.859
Let me just swirl it around
a bit. Yellow.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.294
Yeah, it's... I'm in a room.
It's familiar, it's...

36:36.462 --> 36:37.596
Is the yellow bringing up

36:37.629 --> 36:40.632
any particular memory?

36:46.405 --> 36:47.839
-I remember...
-LUCIOUS: To the Empire.

36:47.873 --> 36:49.341
CROWD:
To the Empire!

36:49.375 --> 36:52.244
I remember this... feeling.

36:52.278 --> 36:53.445
I remember.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.981
I remember what this is.

36:59.150 --> 37:02.454
All the memories.

37:05.090 --> 37:06.792
I remember.

37:10.296 --> 37:12.298
Andre.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.533
They took her away.

37:14.566 --> 37:17.803
Do you understand
what's happening?

37:17.836 --> 37:19.305
Your synapses are reawakening

37:19.338 --> 37:22.441
because your connection
between the music

37:22.474 --> 37:24.343
and the color.
This is amazing.

37:25.444 --> 37:27.379
LUCIOUS:
I fought for them.

37:27.413 --> 37:30.449
I remember you.

37:30.482 --> 37:34.119
I remember...

37:54.139 --> 37:57.108
You're my muse.

37:59.878 --> 38:02.113
-LUCIOUS: It's you.
-COOKIE: Lucious.

38:02.147 --> 38:03.515
It's me.

38:04.550 --> 38:05.651
(laughs)

38:12.023 --> 38:14.360
I love you.

38:33.979 --> 38:35.981
*

38:51.930 --> 38:53.532
(door opens)

38:53.565 --> 38:55.367
Hakeem?

38:55.401 --> 38:57.235
-Baby, hey.
-Thanks for coming, baby.

38:57.268 --> 38:59.070
Where's Bella?

38:59.104 --> 39:01.006
She's okay. She's in
the carriage. She's asleep.

39:01.039 --> 39:02.841
-Okay.
-T, I love you.

39:02.874 --> 39:04.876
-Let's go. -Yeah,
I love you, too. And that's why

39:04.910 --> 39:06.378
-we can't go...
-COOKIE: Boy!

39:06.412 --> 39:08.146
-Where are you going?
-Mom.

39:08.179 --> 39:09.915
Don't you see what's happening?

39:09.948 --> 39:11.082
They're trying to take Bella,
and I can't let that

39:11.116 --> 39:12.551
-happen again.
-Come here. Come here.

39:12.584 --> 39:14.520
-Uh-uh.
-Mom, let go!

39:14.553 --> 39:15.821
I can't lose Bella, Mom.

39:15.854 --> 39:17.022
And I can't lose you.

39:17.055 --> 39:18.590
Look.

39:18.624 --> 39:21.326
We are Lyons.

39:21.359 --> 39:23.194
We don't run, okay?

39:23.228 --> 39:25.196
We stick together and we fight.

39:25.230 --> 39:28.567
And when we do that,
nobody can beat us.

39:28.600 --> 39:31.102
I did some things.

39:31.136 --> 39:33.104
I don't care
what you did, Hakeem.

39:33.138 --> 39:34.706
You are my son.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.875
You are my blood,
and I love you.

39:36.908 --> 39:39.445
I will ride with you
until the end of time.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.447
Don't you know that?

39:41.480 --> 39:43.048
Come here.

39:59.665 --> 40:01.667
LUCIOUS:
Good morning to you.

40:03.635 --> 40:05.070
Don't look at my scars.

40:07.673 --> 40:09.575
Why you covering up the scars?

40:09.608 --> 40:12.711
You ashamed of them?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.746
You shouldn't be.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.417
Well, they're not very pretty.

40:21.419 --> 40:23.221
Well, that's what you say.

40:23.254 --> 40:24.956
They're beautiful to me.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.430
Thank you.

40:32.464 --> 40:34.032
For really seeing me.

40:35.033 --> 40:36.234
I was so surprised

40:36.267 --> 40:39.437
when you said it before.

40:39.471 --> 40:42.340
But I love you, too.

40:42.373 --> 40:44.275
-(laughing): Really?
-I love what we're creating.

40:44.309 --> 40:47.445
I mean, this... breakthrough,

40:47.479 --> 40:49.848
the excitement of it,
I-I mean...

40:49.881 --> 40:52.518
(exhales)

40:52.551 --> 40:55.887
What do you think
about me writing a book?

40:59.891 --> 41:02.628
I think you misunderstood.

41:02.661 --> 41:05.096
I mean, I... don't mean
like I'm gonna take ownership.

41:05.130 --> 41:06.698
You're the artist.

41:06.732 --> 41:10.836
And I'm... just so happy
to be your muse.

41:17.475 --> 41:19.077
Claudia...

41:22.514 --> 41:24.583
You're not my muse.

41:27.352 --> 41:29.688
Cookie's my muse.

41:29.721 --> 41:32.390
That's what I remembered
last night in the painting.

41:32.423 --> 41:35.493
I mean, it...
it all came back to me.

41:35.527 --> 41:39.731
I don't think you can trust
all of your memories yet.

41:39.765 --> 41:42.734
I mean, we...
we were at the lion.

41:42.768 --> 41:45.837
And you said,

41:45.871 --> 41:47.472
would I come with you.

41:47.505 --> 41:49.708
Dwight, remember? You...

41:49.741 --> 41:52.010
I love Cookie.

41:53.444 --> 41:55.146
You and me. Dwight, remember?

41:55.180 --> 41:56.548
Stop calling me Dwight.

41:56.582 --> 41:58.483
My name is Lucious.

41:58.516 --> 42:00.251
No. No, there is no Lucious.

42:00.285 --> 42:01.519
Lucious is gone.

42:01.553 --> 42:02.921
-(door opens)
-It's Dwight.

42:02.954 --> 42:05.023
-No, my name is Lucious.
-(door closes)

42:05.056 --> 42:07.859
Uh, what the hell
is going on here?

42:07.893 --> 42:10.596
I think you should go
and I need to be alone with him.

42:10.629 --> 42:12.864
I think he's a little bit
confused right now.

42:12.898 --> 42:14.900
I think the only one
confused here is you.

42:14.933 --> 42:16.434
You don't give orders
in my house.

42:16.467 --> 42:17.936
Now, you did a wonderful job.

42:17.969 --> 42:19.771
I feel great.

42:19.805 --> 42:22.440
My office will send you a check.
You may leave now.

42:26.778 --> 42:29.715
Uh, well, you heard the man.

42:29.748 --> 42:31.783
(Cookie clears throat)

42:31.817 --> 42:34.519
Is there anyone you would like
for me to call for you?

42:34.552 --> 42:35.721
Hello?

42:35.754 --> 42:38.790
Webb! Juanita?

42:38.824 --> 42:39.958
Can you take Claudia

42:39.991 --> 42:41.526
up to her room
so she can pull it together?

42:41.559 --> 42:43.261
Yes, ma'am.

I'll take care of it.

42:52.337 --> 42:53.839
I know you will.

42:55.907 --> 42:56.942
