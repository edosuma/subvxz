00:01.835 --> 00:02.168
This is th

00:02.168 --> 00:04.237
the
Evergreen forest.

00:04.237 --> 00:06.639
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:08.208 --> 00:10.543
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.543 --> 00:12.278
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

00:13.913 --> 00:15.815
Yeeeehaaaa!

00:16.449 --> 00:17.550
Yikes!

00:18.485 --> 00:19.819
Yaaaah...

00:22.622 --> 00:23.890
Yeaaaah!

00:23.890 --> 00:26.860
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:34.034 --> 00:36.603
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:38.204 --> 00:39.539
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.876 --> 00:45.311
And his life would be simple
except for...

00:46.379 --> 00:47.714
the Raccoons!!

00:47.714 --> 00:48.515
♪ (show theme music) ♪

01:02.262 --> 01:04.864
Everyone loves
a good ghost story,

01:04.864 --> 01:06.666
but if you're Cyril Sneer,

01:06.666 --> 01:10.703
and at times find past coming
back to haunt you,

01:10.703 --> 01:14.908
chances are it's by a ghost
you created yourself.

01:14.908 --> 01:16.409
I'm telling you, Cedric,

01:16.409 --> 01:20.413
this play of yours is a
guaranteed smash hit.

01:20.413 --> 01:21.648
Listen to this.

01:21.648 --> 01:24.017
By-line Bert Raccoon.

01:24.017 --> 01:27.887
Sneer Mansion Music
Hall set to re-open

01:27.887 --> 01:29.789
with fabulous new play

01:29.789 --> 01:33.193
by budding genius, Cedric Sneer.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.394
Ah, Bert.

01:34.394 --> 01:36.596
The padlock is rusty.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.298
Don't you, overstuffed
pork bellies,

01:38.298 --> 01:40.133
ever oil anything around here?

01:40.133 --> 01:43.136
Pig 1: But boss, after
what happened the last time

01:43.136 --> 01:45.572
you did a show here,
you told us...

01:45.572 --> 01:46.606
Never mind that.

01:46.606 --> 01:48.741
Cedric needs a place
to perform his play.

01:48.741 --> 01:51.811
And if you three did a little
work around here for a change,

01:51.811 --> 01:53.246
I could let him in here.

01:53.246 --> 01:54.881
Gee, Pop,
how come you stopped

01:54.881 --> 01:57.083
producing shows here anyway?

01:57.083 --> 01:59.853
Why? Uh,
because the theater

01:59.853 --> 02:02.355
is no place for
making money, Cedric.

02:03.089 --> 02:04.124
Got it!

02:05.692 --> 02:09.295
Pig 3: I-It's k-kind
of creepy in there, boss.

02:09.295 --> 02:10.663
Oooh, yeah!

02:10.663 --> 02:13.733
This place will be great
for Cedric's play!

02:15.068 --> 02:18.004
You don't suppose
it's haunted, do you?

02:18.004 --> 02:21.608
Hoo, boy. What a story
that would make!

02:21.608 --> 02:23.776
It is kinda spooky.

02:23.776 --> 02:25.411
He-he, nonsense.

02:25.411 --> 02:27.614
All it needs is a good cleaning.

02:29.349 --> 02:31.251
Uh, what was that, Pop?

02:31.251 --> 02:32.852
Just the wind boys...

02:32.852 --> 02:35.121
Nothing
to be afraid of.

02:35.121 --> 02:38.324
Afraid? Who's afraid?

02:38.324 --> 02:41.294
Aahhh!!

02:42.662 --> 02:44.831
Um, boss, when we said,

02:44.831 --> 02:47.867
we wanted to be in the theatre...

02:47.867 --> 02:50.637
Pig2: This isn't exactly,
what we meant.

02:50.637 --> 02:52.172
What are you
complaining about?

02:52.172 --> 02:54.140
You're in this
theatre, aren't you?

02:54.140 --> 02:57.544
And you get to stay here until
that lighting grid is gleaming.

02:57.544 --> 02:58.578
Understand?

02:58.578 --> 03:00.947
Everyone on the
list has auditioned so,

03:00.947 --> 03:03.550
now I'll call on our
playwright and director,

03:03.550 --> 03:06.452
Cedric Sneer, to
announce the cast list

03:06.452 --> 03:08.922
for the Mystery of
the Haunted Treasure.

03:08.922 --> 03:11.324
Excuse me, sir...

03:11.324 --> 03:14.294
but I trust we are not too late.

03:14.294 --> 03:15.562
Lady Baden-Baden:
I have come to audition

03:15.562 --> 03:17.230
for your play, Cedric.

03:17.230 --> 03:20.500
I hope this won't take
long, my little rose bush.

03:20.500 --> 03:25.305
I do have a meeting
for our latest big deal.

03:25.305 --> 03:27.840
Lady Baden-Baden:
Oooh, Knoxie, I shall be,

03:27.840 --> 03:31.411
as the bard said,
tedious brief.

03:31.411 --> 03:34.480
Knox old pal, I
couldn't help but overhear

03:34.480 --> 03:36.216
you mention a big deal?

03:36.216 --> 03:38.451
Frankly, Sir,
dealing with you

03:38.451 --> 03:41.321
always ends up
costing me money.

03:41.321 --> 03:45.058
Not that money can buy
happiness, of course.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.392
It can't?!

03:46.392 --> 03:49.429
Now take my
little cabbage leaf.

03:49.429 --> 03:53.967
Why, she has her heart set
on a part in your boy's play.

03:53.967 --> 03:55.668
And frankly, Sir,

03:55.668 --> 03:58.438
what makes my little
grapevine happy,

03:58.438 --> 04:01.040
makes me happy.

04:02.709 --> 04:07.914
Lady Baden-Baden: Straight to
the very heart of my heart.

04:07.914 --> 04:11.184
Gee, that was swell,
Lady Baden-Baden,

04:11.184 --> 04:14.220
but, uh, based on
all the auditions,

04:14.220 --> 04:17.223
I think the lead
should go to Melissa.

04:17.223 --> 04:19.959
Hey, Melissa,
you're gonna be a star!

04:19.959 --> 04:23.730
This is going to
hurt my little turnip green

04:23.730 --> 04:26.065
a great deal, Sir.

04:26.065 --> 04:27.700
Uh, heh heh,

04:27.700 --> 04:30.103
hold on Knox... uh, Cedric?

04:30.103 --> 04:33.439
But there is the part of
the innkeeper, Lady Baden-Baden.

04:33.439 --> 04:36.276
It doesn't have any lines, but...

04:36.276 --> 04:38.044
Lady Baden-Baden:
I should be honored, Cedric.

04:38.044 --> 04:41.648
After all, there
are no small parts,

04:41.648 --> 04:44.284
merely small actors.

04:44.284 --> 04:45.918
Cedric,
don't be a fool!

04:45.918 --> 04:49.289
This play needs Lady Baden-Baden
in a featured part.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.357
But, Pop...
No buts!

04:51.357 --> 04:55.094
As producer of this show,
I know what's best for me...

04:55.094 --> 04:56.329
I mean, you. He!

04:56.329 --> 04:58.998
She needs lines, lots of lines.

04:58.998 --> 05:02.168
Well...
I guess I can try.

05:02.168 --> 05:03.670
Good boy, Cedric.

05:03.670 --> 05:06.739
He-eh! Knox, old buddy...

05:07.240 --> 05:10.243
Where are those
bungling bacon bits?

05:10.243 --> 05:12.478
Pigs!
Aaaaa!!

05:12.478 --> 05:13.680
Ahhh!

05:13.680 --> 05:15.648
Pig 1: You wanted
to see us, boss?

05:15.648 --> 05:18.384
I want the full
red carpet treatment

05:18.384 --> 05:19.919
for Lady Baden-Baden!

05:19.919 --> 05:22.255
So roll out that
crate of costumes

05:22.255 --> 05:24.524
and find her the
best in the house.

05:24.524 --> 05:26.893
Stop hanging around
and get to work!

05:26.893 --> 05:29.796
By the time I'm finished,
Lady Baden-Baden

05:29.796 --> 05:32.432
is going to have the
best part in this play,

05:32.432 --> 05:36.135
and I am going to have a
great part in Knox's big deal.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.203
Uaaaah!
Lady Baden-Baden: Huh?

05:37.203 --> 05:38.371
Huh? Oooff. Ouch.

05:38.371 --> 05:39.605
I say, Sir...

05:39.605 --> 05:42.308
Ahhhhhhhhhh.

05:42.308 --> 05:44.344
You blundering bacon buffoons!

05:44.344 --> 05:46.012
Gee, Pop, this time,

05:46.012 --> 05:48.314
I don't think
it was their fault.

05:48.314 --> 05:50.850
Pig 3: Who was
driving that crate?

05:50.850 --> 05:52.985
I guess it
was just an accident.

05:54.153 --> 05:57.190
Sorry, Cedric,
but this was no accident.

05:57.190 --> 05:58.791
Read this.

05:59.459 --> 06:02.061
Oh my gosh. It says...

06:02.061 --> 06:03.529
Beware!

06:05.665 --> 06:08.835
Pop says adding new lines
will make the play better.

06:08.835 --> 06:12.038
So why am I finding
them so hard to write?

06:12.038 --> 06:14.607
Ah, Cedric,
you're just nervous,

06:14.607 --> 06:16.876
cause it's your
first day of rehearsal.

06:16.876 --> 06:18.411
But look at Broo and me,

06:18.411 --> 06:22.148
we're off to see if that
theatre really is haunted.

06:22.148 --> 06:23.916
And are we nervous?

06:23.916 --> 06:27.320
You don't think it
really could be haunted, do you?

06:27.320 --> 06:29.889
Well, if it is,

06:29.889 --> 06:32.992
Bert Raccoon, ace reporter,

06:32.992 --> 06:34.727
will get the story.

06:34.727 --> 06:37.697
Now, c'mon Cedric,
your public awaits.

06:38.364 --> 06:40.967
now in this scene
Lady Baden-Baden enters

06:40.967 --> 06:44.737
as the innkeeper and leads
Melissa into the empty basement.

06:44.737 --> 06:47.540
Cedric wrote you a new line
here, Lady Baden-Baden.

06:47.540 --> 06:49.976
Lady Baden-Baden: And here
is the empty basement. Hmm.

06:49.976 --> 06:52.078
You exit,
and Melissa looks around

06:52.078 --> 06:53.279
for the treasure chest,

06:53.279 --> 06:56.282
but be careful not to step
on that button, Melissa.

06:56.282 --> 06:59.352
It's set to open the trap
door in a later scene.

06:59.352 --> 07:02.522
Then Schaeffer as the ghost
to frighten Melissa away.

07:02.522 --> 07:04.424
I'll be there
as soon as I figure out

07:04.424 --> 07:06.025
this ghost sheet, Ralph.

07:07.226 --> 07:09.395
Hello? Oh, sure.

07:09.395 --> 07:11.531
Uh, for you. Mr. Sneer.

07:11.531 --> 07:13.800
Who is it?
It's Mr. Knox.

07:13.800 --> 07:16.936
Knox? Of course, Knox.

07:16.936 --> 07:20.473
We're making a big deal
out of everything she does.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.577
Lady Baden-Baden: And here
is the empty basement.

07:24.577 --> 07:27.079
In fact,
she's never off the stage.

07:27.079 --> 07:29.115
Thanks,
Lady Baden-Baden.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.350
We'll call you when we need you.

07:33.152 --> 07:34.821
Ta-taaa!

07:34.821 --> 07:37.390
Uh, I'll get back to you.

07:39.158 --> 07:42.762
Cedric, the innkeeper needs
more lines in this scene.

07:42.762 --> 07:44.664
Long lines, with big words.

07:45.298 --> 07:47.233
Ooooh!
Not now, Schaeffer.

07:47.233 --> 07:48.568
Watch out for
that button, Schaeffer!

07:48.568 --> 07:50.002
Ahhhhh!

07:50.002 --> 07:51.804
Pop!
Mr. Sneer?

07:51.804 --> 07:53.339
Are you okay?

07:53.339 --> 07:56.642
I'm fine.
Just get me out of here!

07:57.710 --> 08:01.581
It's no use, this
ghost costume doesn't fit.

08:01.581 --> 08:02.682
Cedric/Ralph/Melissa: What?

08:02.682 --> 08:04.650
You mean,
you weren't just in here?

08:04.650 --> 08:06.953
Who me? No, why?

08:06.953 --> 08:08.154
I...

08:08.154 --> 08:11.858
I think, this place
is haunted by a real ghost.

08:13.459 --> 08:16.229
Oh, Lady Baden-Baden,

08:16.229 --> 08:20.032
I had no idea you had such a
background in the theatre.

08:20.032 --> 08:23.836
You've performed at the
Royal Victorian Theatre.

08:23.836 --> 08:25.972
Lady Baden-Baden:
Ever so long ago.

08:25.972 --> 08:30.510
Ah, Melissa, the
magic of the theatre.

08:30.510 --> 08:33.813
Its world touched
a shy young girl

08:33.813 --> 08:37.850
and made her believe in
herself for the first time.

08:37.850 --> 08:40.987
It dressed her, like Cinderella,

08:40.987 --> 08:42.889
in beautiful gowns...

08:42.889 --> 08:46.492
Let her express
her innermost soul.

08:46.492 --> 08:50.196
And made so many
dreams come true.

08:51.831 --> 08:53.799
I have often wondered, Melissa,

08:53.799 --> 08:58.504
had I not left the theatre
for the rigours of society,

08:58.504 --> 09:01.007
what might I have become?

09:01.007 --> 09:03.943
Lady Baden-Baden,
I've got some ideas on

09:03.943 --> 09:06.646
how we can beef up
your part in the show.

09:06.646 --> 09:08.014
Now in scene one...

09:08.014 --> 09:09.882
Excuse me, Mr. Sneer,

09:09.882 --> 09:11.918
but isn't this Cedric's play?

09:11.918 --> 09:15.154
Cedric's play,
maybe, but my theatre.

09:15.154 --> 09:17.890
And only I have
the big deal, uh, eh,

09:17.890 --> 09:20.026
uh, the big picture in mind.

09:20.026 --> 09:23.429
Lady Baden-Baden: Melissa's
point is well taken, Cyril...

09:23.429 --> 09:26.365
We must look deep
into ourselves, and...

09:26.365 --> 09:28.935
Oooh dear!
What's wrong?

09:28.935 --> 09:33.873
Remember
the voices from beyond.

09:33.873 --> 09:35.608
The voices from beyond?

09:35.608 --> 09:37.543
Who said that? Aaaah?

09:37.543 --> 09:40.046
Beware the phantom.

09:47.219 --> 09:48.754
Just you wait, Melissa.

09:48.754 --> 09:50.556
With this new equipment of mine,

09:50.556 --> 09:53.626
that phantom is
as good as found.

09:53.626 --> 09:56.662
You know, it's
funny about that phantom.

09:56.662 --> 10:01.133
He only shows up when Mr. Sneer
is interfering in Cedric's play.

10:01.133 --> 10:03.836
Yeah, well, I guess
everyone's a critic.

10:03.836 --> 10:05.871
But look out, phantom.

10:05.871 --> 10:09.809
Bert Raccoon, ace
investigative reporter,

10:09.809 --> 10:11.377
is on the job!

10:11.377 --> 10:14.580
There's something fishy
about that phantom.

10:14.580 --> 10:17.850
I just can't quite
put my finger on what.

10:18.484 --> 10:20.386
Pigs!!
- Huh?

10:20.386 --> 10:22.655
It's time we fixed
that phantom's wagon.

10:22.655 --> 10:24.757
You three get over
to that theatre,

10:24.757 --> 10:26.859
find the phantom
and get rid of it.

10:26.859 --> 10:30.863
I'm going to be part of Knox's
big deal, even if it kills me!

10:30.863 --> 10:34.767
Pig 3: Hm, he means,
even if it kills us.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.803
Okay Broo, we've
got one super duper

10:37.803 --> 10:40.139
spook-sensitive tape recorder.

10:40.139 --> 10:44.243
Pig2: Two garlands of garlic
to stave off evil spirits.

10:44.243 --> 10:48.581
An XL3-33 special
phantom camera filter...

10:48.581 --> 10:51.684
Pig 3: Four wooden
stakes to drive through

10:51.684 --> 10:53.986
the hearts of vampires.

10:53.986 --> 10:56.756
A five pound bag
of flour for the old

10:56.756 --> 11:00.359
'throw the flour on the
ectoplasm' routine.

11:00.359 --> 11:04.764
Pig 1: And a slick vacuum to
suck up ghostly apparitions.

11:04.764 --> 11:07.800
It says so in
the guarantee. Oops.

11:07.800 --> 11:10.403
I tell ya, Broo,
we have the will,

11:10.403 --> 11:12.638
we have the technology.

11:12.638 --> 11:16.375
And soon we will
have the phantom.

11:18.544 --> 11:20.746
Huh. What was that?

11:20.746 --> 11:25.685
♪ I can feel the charge
across the air ♪

11:25.685 --> 11:35.194
♪ I can read your thoughts when
you're not there ♪

Pig 1: I got him. Aghhhh.

12:40.059 --> 12:41.260
Pig 2: Need a hand?

12:41.260 --> 12:42.762
Melissa/Cedric/Pig 3: Huh?

12:42.762 --> 12:43.796
Pig 1: Yieee.

12:44.597 --> 12:47.967
Pig 2: Look, boss. It's got
an old script stuck to it

12:47.967 --> 12:51.270
called, The
Voices From Beyond.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.738
But that's
what the phantom said

12:52.738 --> 12:54.073
in our dressing room.

12:54.073 --> 12:55.074
Give me that.

12:56.041 --> 12:57.376
Pop, what's wrong?

12:57.376 --> 12:59.145
You look like you
just saw a ghost.

12:59.145 --> 13:01.213
Saw ghost, saw ghost!

13:01.213 --> 13:03.849
You'll pay
for this, Sneer.

13:03.849 --> 13:07.286
Someday I'll make
you pay for this.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.621
Pop?

13:08.888 --> 13:10.923
Lady Baden-Baden:
Excuse me, but I seem to have

13:10.923 --> 13:12.825
misplaced my script.

13:12.825 --> 13:15.294
Ah, Cyril thank
you so very much.

13:15.294 --> 13:17.463
Hey! Come back here and...

13:17.463 --> 13:18.931
Lady Baden-Baden:
I beg your pardon?

13:18.931 --> 13:21.100
Oh..h, Lady Baden-Baden.

13:21.100 --> 13:22.668
What I meant was..uh...

13:22.668 --> 13:24.970
come back here and perform

13:24.970 --> 13:26.572
any time. Heh he.

13:26.572 --> 13:28.440
Lady Baden-Baden:
You're too kind, I'm sure.

13:28.440 --> 13:31.577
Heheh. Pigs!
Yes, boss?

13:31.577 --> 13:33.279
I want that phantom.

13:33.279 --> 13:35.781
And I want him now. Capeesh?

13:35.781 --> 13:37.416
Yes, boss!

13:37.416 --> 13:40.719
Uh, let's rehearse the
second act finale everyone.

13:40.719 --> 13:44.123
Bert, could you ask Lady
Baden-Baden to meet us onstage?

13:44.123 --> 13:46.125
Sure, Ralphie.
C'mon, Broo.

13:46.125 --> 13:47.426
Lady Baden-Baden: Wait a minute.

13:47.426 --> 13:48.694
This isn't my script.

13:48.694 --> 13:53.299
It's, goodness, it's by my
old friend Edward Miller.

13:53.299 --> 13:57.403
Act 1, Scene 1: Is my
heart not aquiver?

13:57.403 --> 14:00.005
Is my soul not aflame?

14:00.005 --> 14:03.509
Am I not they Queen,
and a woman?

14:03.509 --> 14:05.211
Ohhhh, Lady Baden-Baden...

14:05.211 --> 14:07.546
A part you were born to play.

14:09.815 --> 14:11.350
Lady Baden-Baden?

14:11.350 --> 14:13.385
Lady Baden-Baden: Yesssss?
Is that you, Knoxie?

14:13.385 --> 14:14.987
No ma'am, it's Bert.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.890
Uh, we kind of need
you onstage. Okay?

14:17.890 --> 14:19.191
Lady Baden-Baden:
Of course, Bert...

14:19.191 --> 14:20.492
I shall be right there...

14:20.492 --> 14:21.660
Oooooh.

14:23.696 --> 14:25.231
Lady Baden-Baden!?!

14:26.532 --> 14:28.901
I am appalled, Sir.

14:28.901 --> 14:31.604
I am shocked and outraged.

14:31.604 --> 14:35.674
You mean to tell me my little
sugar apple has disappeared?

14:35.674 --> 14:37.977
Don't you worry, Mr. Knox.

14:37.977 --> 14:43.482
Bert Raccoon, ace reporter and
super sleuth is on the case!

14:43.482 --> 14:46.852
Now, what do we know?
Nothing.

14:46.852 --> 14:48.254
Nothing. Excellent.

14:48.254 --> 14:50.723
We can start with a clean slate.

14:50.723 --> 14:55.160
Mr. Sneer,
someone is responsible

14:55.160 --> 14:58.130
for this outrage!!

14:58.130 --> 15:00.499
Exactly, Mr. Knox.

15:00.499 --> 15:02.902
And I think I know, who.

15:03.569 --> 15:05.437
Bert/Cedric/Cyril/Knox:
Hey? What? Huh?

15:05.437 --> 15:08.207
We've looked for
Lady Baden-Baden everywhere.

15:08.207 --> 15:11.377
But it's like she just
vanished into thin air.

15:11.377 --> 15:12.544
I know, Schaeffer.

15:12.544 --> 15:15.281
First Mr. Sneer has
all those accidents.

15:15.281 --> 15:19.585
Then my little
key lime pie disappears.

15:19.585 --> 15:22.221
And now
the lights go out.

15:22.221 --> 15:23.722
No problem, Melissa.

15:23.722 --> 15:26.959
For the lights are
on where it counts,

15:26.959 --> 15:31.063
in the fertile brain
of Bert Raccoon.

15:31.063 --> 15:32.131
Ouch.

15:33.866 --> 15:36.702
Who is now going
to break the story

15:36.702 --> 15:39.905
of the phantom wide open.

15:39.905 --> 15:46.779
The key to the whole mystery is
the voices from beyond.

15:46.779 --> 15:51.050
But whose voice?
And beyond where?

15:51.050 --> 15:53.052
Clue number one.

15:53.052 --> 15:55.487
When the crate
ran into Mr. Sneer

15:55.487 --> 15:57.823
the first day of rehearsal,

15:57.823 --> 16:01.293
whose voice came from beyond,

16:01.293 --> 16:03.996
from beyond the stage?

16:03.996 --> 16:06.732
I say, Sir, look out.

16:06.732 --> 16:08.334
Clue number two.

16:08.334 --> 16:11.537
When Mr. Sneer fell
through the trap door,

16:11.537 --> 16:14.506
whose voice came from beyond...

16:14.506 --> 16:17.910
from beyond the theatre,
by telephone?

16:17.910 --> 16:21.413
Knox...
Uh, of course, Knox.

16:21.413 --> 16:24.917
What is this
leading to, Sir?

16:24.917 --> 16:28.587
It's leading, sir,
to clue number three.

16:28.587 --> 16:32.358
Just before
Lady Baden-Baden disappeared,

16:32.358 --> 16:38.063
whose voice did she think she
heard from beyond that door?

16:38.063 --> 16:40.432
Lady Baden-Baden: Yes?
Is that you, Knoxie?

16:40.432 --> 16:43.535
And why didn't
she call for help?

16:43.535 --> 16:45.337
Well, that's...

16:45.337 --> 16:47.673
Pig 3: That's the phantom.

16:47.673 --> 16:49.975
Because she went
with someone she knew.

16:49.975 --> 16:50.976
Pig 1: Quick.

16:50.976 --> 16:53.445
...and whose
true identity is...

16:53.445 --> 16:56.382
Aiiieeee!
What's going on?

16:56.382 --> 16:59.618
Pig 3: I've got him!
Pig 2: That's my nose, Lloyd!

16:59.618 --> 17:01.153
Hey!
Pig 1: Let go!

17:01.153 --> 17:02.154
Pig 3: Ooops.

17:02.154 --> 17:05.357
You..you,
incompetent ham hocks!

17:05.357 --> 17:07.626
This is an outrage!

17:07.626 --> 17:10.462
I shall see you in court, Sir.

17:10.462 --> 17:14.066
Lady Baden-Baden:
Noooo! You shall see this.

17:14.066 --> 17:17.870
This was to have been
the love scene in my play,

17:17.870 --> 17:21.673
until a callous producer
had his way.

17:21.673 --> 17:22.708
What..?

17:22.708 --> 17:25.377
And this is
what had once begun

17:25.377 --> 17:29.214
as a touching reunion
of father and son.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.316
And now Cyril Sneer,

17:31.316 --> 17:35.754
prepare to meet thy phantom!

17:35.754 --> 17:38.924
Right!
And the phantom is...

17:38.924 --> 17:40.893
Ahh!!

17:44.363 --> 17:47.399
Edward Miller.
Precisely!

17:47.399 --> 17:48.901
Uh...

17:48.901 --> 17:50.502
Edward who?

17:50.502 --> 17:54.006
The man who wrote
The Voices From Beyond.

17:54.006 --> 17:55.941
You're the phantom?

17:55.941 --> 17:58.277
Buy why have you been
frightening everyone?

17:58.277 --> 17:59.411
Yeah!

17:59.411 --> 18:03.015
I only meant
to frighten Cyril Sneer.

18:03.015 --> 18:04.349
But why?

18:04.349 --> 18:05.617
Justice.

18:05.617 --> 18:07.152
You see, Cedric,

18:07.152 --> 18:09.421
we have something in common.

18:09.421 --> 18:12.224
For I too once had a play
produced here,

18:12.224 --> 18:14.526
where a greedy producer

18:14.526 --> 18:16.728
turned my playwright's dream

18:16.728 --> 18:18.897
into a nightmare!

18:18.897 --> 18:20.666
Is that true, Pop?

18:20.666 --> 18:22.701
Uh, oh...

18:22.701 --> 18:24.736
So when
I read that Cyril was now

18:24.736 --> 18:26.772
going to produce your play,

18:26.772 --> 18:29.041
I stole into the theatre

18:29.041 --> 18:30.976
to try and stop him!

18:30.976 --> 18:34.146
But that
does not explain, Sir,

18:34.146 --> 18:38.150
your abduction of my
little honey bee.

18:38.150 --> 18:39.551
Lady Baden-Baden: But Knoxie,

18:39.551 --> 18:41.220
I went with him willingly.

18:41.220 --> 18:43.055
I was reading his play,

18:43.055 --> 18:46.725
when suddenly a
secret passage opened,

18:46.725 --> 18:48.460
and voila!

18:48.460 --> 18:50.562
I saw there the greying,

18:50.562 --> 18:52.631
yet distinguished figure

18:52.631 --> 18:56.001
of the promising young
playwright I had once known.

18:56.001 --> 18:58.270
And she
read my play for me

18:58.270 --> 19:01.640
so..so beautifully.

19:01.640 --> 19:06.011
Lady Baden-Baden was
born to play the lead.

19:06.011 --> 19:08.647
Lady B-B: The play is brilliant,

19:08.647 --> 19:11.116
and must be produced!

19:11.116 --> 19:13.785
Don't you agree, Cyril?

19:13.785 --> 19:15.254
Are you crazy?

19:15.254 --> 19:16.989
Produce the script again?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.925
I nearly lost a fortune
on it in the first place?

19:19.925 --> 19:24.029
It would mean a great deal

19:24.029 --> 19:26.165
to all of us, Sir.

19:26.165 --> 19:30.002
Well, I suppose
with a few rewrites.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.370
Rewrites?

19:31.370 --> 19:34.039
(laughs) Just a
little producer humor...

19:34.039 --> 19:36.742
Well, what's everybody
standing around for?

19:36.742 --> 19:38.210
Onstage, everyone!

19:38.210 --> 19:39.545
Uh, Cedric?

19:39.545 --> 19:40.779
Yeah, Pop?

19:40.779 --> 19:43.682
Eh, speaking
of rewrites...

19:43.682 --> 19:46.385
I'm still working
on them, Pop, honest.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.719
Well, stop.

19:47.719 --> 19:50.689
I refuse to have you ruin
a perfectly good play

19:50.689 --> 19:52.558
with a lot of mindless revision.

19:52.558 --> 19:54.226
But, Pop,
the changes were your...

19:54.226 --> 19:57.062
I'm the producer
and I'm telling you,

19:57.062 --> 20:00.866
you put on the play you started
with, or the whole deal's off.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.734
Got it?
Got it, Pop!

20:04.536 --> 20:05.804
Yay!

20:05.804 --> 20:08.907
As for you three, you've
got a little work to do.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.209
Huh?

20:10.209 --> 20:11.977
That's right!
I want this set

20:11.977 --> 20:13.879
rebuilt better than new.

20:13.879 --> 20:17.516
Everything has to be
perfect for my son's play.

20:17.516 --> 20:19.885
Yes, sir. Yes, sir!

20:19.885 --> 20:21.820
There's an old saying
in the theatre

20:21.820 --> 20:24.389
that the rockiest rehearsals
often make

20:24.389 --> 20:26.525
the most rewarding openings.

20:26.525 --> 20:28.393
For Cedric and Cyril Sneer

20:28.393 --> 20:32.231
theirs was finally to be an
opening night to remember.

20:38.503 --> 20:40.405
That's my boy!

20:40.405 --> 20:41.773
Mr. Sneer?

20:41.773 --> 20:44.509
Bert Raccoon, for the
Evergreen Standard here.

20:44.509 --> 20:48.447
Having obviously spared no
expense on this production, sir,

20:48.447 --> 20:50.949
do you expect to see a profit?

20:50.949 --> 20:53.852
A profit?
I always make a profit!

20:53.852 --> 20:56.755
Ha, I am going to make
a profit, aren't I, Knox?

20:56.755 --> 20:59.591
I mean, on this
big deal of ours?

20:59.591 --> 21:03.629
Why, the highest
profit of all, Mr. Sneer,

21:03.629 --> 21:06.798
the profit of having
done a good deed.

21:06.798 --> 21:08.033
A good deed?

21:08.033 --> 21:09.768
Exactly, Sir.

21:09.768 --> 21:11.703
The biggest charity event

21:11.703 --> 21:14.706
ever to hit the
Evergreen forest!

21:14.706 --> 21:16.808
Ch..charity event?!

21:16.808 --> 21:18.777
I thought you knew, Sir.

21:18.777 --> 21:22.781
You're sponsoring a
luxury retirement home

21:22.781 --> 21:26.985
for Lady Baden-Baden's
old friends in the arts.

21:26.985 --> 21:29.321
You mean,
instead of making money,

21:29.321 --> 21:32.224
I'm going to be...
giving it away?

21:32.224 --> 21:35.661
Oh, and a great deal
of it too, Sir!

21:35.661 --> 21:38.063
There's no business

21:38.063 --> 21:40.465
like show business!

21:40.465 --> 21:42.434
