00:28.111 --> 00:32.762
- And the kid with the bell?
- What kid? What bell?

00:32.908 --> 00:37.729
The kid. After the mine caves in,
he rings the bell to alert the town.

00:37.829 --> 00:42.400
- Is that in the script?
- What if we gave him a disease?

00:42.501 --> 00:46.113
- A disease?
- Leg braces, that sort of thing.

00:46.213 --> 00:48.657
- But he runs.
- He could hobble.

00:48.757 --> 00:51.576
A How Green Was My Valley thing.

00:51.677 --> 00:53.700
Is that McDowall kid available?

00:53.845 --> 00:56.494
- Too old. Plus, he's English.
- So?

00:56.598 --> 00:59.877
- The script's set in Tennessee.
- Did I get that page?

00:59.977 --> 01:03.627
Forget the disease.
Nobody wants it. It's depressing.

01:03.730 --> 01:07.255
- Boss is right. Who needs it?
- It's horrible.

01:07.401 --> 01:09.720
- I hate disease.
- Box-office poison.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.182
Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

01:13.282 --> 01:16.351
What if we give the character...?
What's his name?

01:16.451 --> 01:18.770
- Floyd.
- Terrible name. Change it.

01:18.870 --> 01:22.224
- Say we give no-name a dog.
- A dog?

01:22.332 --> 01:25.060
A dog. No-name's faithful companion.

01:25.168 --> 01:28.818
Toils at his master's side
in the coal mine.

01:28.922 --> 01:32.075
Cave-in happens, only the dog gets out.

01:32.175 --> 01:34.653
Because dogs are smaller, usually.

01:34.761 --> 01:39.492
And it's the dog that runs
up the hill and rings the bell.

01:39.641 --> 01:41.460
Holy crap, that's beautiful.

01:41.560 --> 01:43.795
- I'm choked up.
- I got goose bumps.

01:43.895 --> 01:46.999
Lassie pictures always gross high.

01:47.107 --> 01:49.801
Instead of a disease,
we give the kid a dog?

01:49.901 --> 01:56.183
- No more kid. The kid's a dog.
- Could be what the movie needs.

01:56.283 --> 02:00.104
Let's ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

02:04.750 --> 02:09.196
Wow. That's just...

02:10.505 --> 02:12.733
amazing.

02:18.347 --> 02:21.792
Of course, it's not like
the postcards say it is.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.245
It's not glamour everywhere you look.

02:26.146 --> 02:29.716
I should know. I live here.

02:30.984 --> 02:32.711
This is my town.

03:29.251 --> 03:32.237
It seems like everyone
here's from someplace else.

03:32.337 --> 03:35.407
The reason? Movies.

03:35.507 --> 03:38.235
Everybody loves the movies...

03:38.343 --> 03:41.204
which makes Hollywood everybody's town.

03:41.304 --> 03:44.248
They come here by the busload.

03:44.349 --> 03:48.454
The next show will be starting
in five minutes.

03:48.562 --> 03:53.543
Please step up
to purchase your tickets...

04:09.082 --> 04:10.809
Here you go.

04:20.051 --> 04:22.162
Candy.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.989
Treats.

04:26.433 --> 04:28.085
- Bonbons.
- There you go.

04:28.185 --> 04:30.587
For most, Grauman's Chinese Theater...

04:30.687 --> 04:34.041
is the most exciting place
on the planet.

04:34.149 --> 04:37.128
For me, it's that and more.

04:38.111 --> 04:41.260
It's the theater playing
my first film credit.

04:41.656 --> 04:43.679
No, not that one.

04:43.784 --> 04:45.727
I wish.

04:46.912 --> 04:51.858
No, I'm the B movie tonight.
Sand Pirates of the Sahara.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.358
Not a bad picture, if I say so myself.

04:56.379 --> 04:58.072
You gotta start somewhere.

05:02.552 --> 05:06.282
God, I love seeing my name on a poster.

05:08.767 --> 05:11.920
Four years ago,
in film land's darkest hour...

05:12.020 --> 05:14.089
the so-called Hollywood 10...

05:14.189 --> 05:18.427
testified before the House Committee
on Un-American Activities...

05:18.527 --> 05:21.676
investigating the Communist menace
in Hollywood.

05:21.780 --> 05:25.225
Have you ever been a member
of the Communist Party?

05:25.325 --> 05:28.679
Communism is not related to this.

05:28.787 --> 05:30.939
Refusing to answer questions...

05:31.039 --> 05:34.609
the 10 writers dared
Congress to come after them.

05:34.709 --> 05:38.734
After years of wrangling,
it's time to pay the piper.

05:38.839 --> 05:42.614
It's off to jail.
The charge: contempt of Congress.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.828
A new round of hearings
begins this fall.

05:44.928 --> 05:49.204
The mandate: Get the Reds
out of Hollywood!

05:49.307 --> 05:53.002
- Miss me?
- Every second.

05:54.604 --> 05:59.084
That's my girlfriend, Sandra Sinclair.
This is her town too.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.804
She's from Cleveland.
She came out here to be an actress.

06:02.904 --> 06:05.302
And that's what she's doing.

06:05.448 --> 06:08.268
The first picture
she ever appeared in...

06:09.578 --> 06:11.601
was the first picture I ever wrote.

06:14.916 --> 06:18.896
The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

06:23.592 --> 06:27.196
Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

06:27.637 --> 06:31.116
- Hands off, Khalid!
- Roland!

06:32.350 --> 06:37.081
- You! I thought you were dead.
- You thought wrong.

06:44.195 --> 06:45.638
Hyah!

06:49.242 --> 06:54.223
- Let her go.
- I find your persistence tiresome.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.850
I get that a lot.

06:58.168 --> 07:00.529
Roland, look out!

07:07.093 --> 07:09.996
This time I'll make sure you're dead.

07:10.096 --> 07:11.915
This time I'll make sure you're dead.

07:12.015 --> 07:14.668
Taste my steel, you dog.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.621
Taste my steel, you dog.

07:17.729 --> 07:20.423
We were young, we were in love...

07:20.523 --> 07:24.845
and we were working
in the pictures. Life was good.

07:26.237 --> 07:29.683
I was walking along, minding my business

07:29.783 --> 07:32.936
When out of that orange-colored sky

07:33.036 --> 07:36.606
Flash! Bam! Alakazam!

07:36.706 --> 07:39.685
Wonderful you came by

07:46.800 --> 07:50.996
Louise, what gives?

07:51.096 --> 07:53.949
They gave everyone the day off.

07:54.057 --> 07:57.878
- What about my pages? Are they typed?
- Pages?

07:57.978 --> 07:59.671
I'm on a deadline, I need my pages.

08:01.022 --> 08:05.093
- Those men took them.
- What men? Those pages aren't ready.

08:05.193 --> 08:08.422
Pete, I'm not even supposed
to be talking to you.

08:18.289 --> 08:22.235
They say you attended those meetings
while in college.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.652
Who's they?

08:23.753 --> 08:27.699
Congress, FBI, Red Channels.
It doesn't matter.

08:27.799 --> 08:32.495
They know who they are,
that's enough. Answer the question.

08:32.595 --> 08:36.541
Meetings, meetings.
How the hell should I know?

08:36.640 --> 08:40.666
It was a long time ago.
I went to college on the G.I. Bill.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.664
The Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

08:46.818 --> 08:50.138
They were Communists? What do I know?

08:50.238 --> 08:53.350
I couldn't figure out
what they were saying.

08:53.450 --> 08:57.437
- Why did you go, Peter?
- There was this girl.

08:57.537 --> 09:00.436
You consorted with Communists
for a girl?

09:00.540 --> 09:04.486
I went to poetry readings too.
That doesn't make me Carl Sandburg.

09:04.586 --> 09:08.073
Leo, you know me. I'm non-political.

09:08.173 --> 09:11.152
Republicans, Democrats, Communists.
They all look alike to me.

09:11.259 --> 09:12.702
Peter?

09:12.802 --> 09:15.746
As legal counsel for this studio...

09:15.847 --> 09:18.291
I strongly advise you
to watch what you say.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.713
Leo, put your agent hat on.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.759
- There must be an angle you can work.
- I'm out of angles.

09:27.859 --> 09:32.135
We're in the middle of negotiating
my new contract.

09:32.238 --> 09:36.309
The studio suspended
negotiations this morning.

09:36.659 --> 09:40.434
I've been blacklisted?
I've been goddamn blacklisted?

09:40.538 --> 09:44.268
- There is no blacklist.
- Right. No blacklist.

09:44.375 --> 09:49.231
Studio just doesn't wanna know you
with this hanging over your head.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.910
I can't leave.
We're shooting in three weeks.

09:54.010 --> 09:56.738
Ashes to Ashes has been pulled.

09:57.097 --> 10:00.497
- You believe it?
- I'm sorry, Peter.

10:00.600 --> 10:03.624
So, what does this mean?
I have to testify?

10:04.187 --> 10:05.505
Assuming they let you.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.834
The least they can do
is let me defend myself.

10:08.942 --> 10:12.797
The studio will lobby on your behalf.
That's all I can promise you.

10:14.364 --> 10:16.558
No guarantees.

10:19.661 --> 10:23.231
- You up for testifying?
- What choice do I have?

10:23.331 --> 10:27.527
They feed on names.
You'll have to give them some.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.321
I'm a writer.
I'll make up names if I have to.

10:30.421 --> 10:34.576
We're talking about my career, my life.

10:34.676 --> 10:37.495
Christ, I'll give them anything
they want.

11:03.454 --> 11:05.932
Come on, toast with me.

11:07.917 --> 11:10.315
To the land of the free
and the home of the brave.

11:16.259 --> 11:19.158
Hey, Pete.
Think maybe you've had enough?

11:20.972 --> 11:25.627
Tell me something, Jerry.
You tight with J. Edgar Hoover?

11:25.727 --> 11:29.089
I wouldn't know Hoover if he walked
in here wearing a dress.

11:29.189 --> 11:34.045
Too bad. He says I'm a Communist.

11:34.402 --> 11:38.973
In fact, at this very moment
some gray little FBI guy...

11:39.073 --> 11:41.517
in a gray little FBI suit...

11:42.410 --> 11:48.188
is hunched over my screenplay,
checking it, line by line...

11:49.125 --> 11:55.698
for the poisonous Marxist
propaganda which surely lurks therein.

11:55.798 --> 11:58.526
Hope they check for spelling.

11:58.635 --> 12:02.035
- I can always use help with that.
- You're babbling.

12:02.138 --> 12:05.708
Ashes to Ashes, my movie!

12:09.312 --> 12:14.088
Could've been good.
Even with the stupid dog.

12:14.776 --> 12:16.844
My Grapes of Wrath.

12:16.945 --> 12:20.595
My shot at doing something
really good, something...

12:22.408 --> 12:24.010
Something.

12:24.911 --> 12:29.649
- What's it about?
- Pain, nobility.

12:29.749 --> 12:32.443
The human condition.

12:35.505 --> 12:36.823
Truth.

12:42.804 --> 12:47.535
It was my chance to get out
of B movies and onto the A list.

12:47.642 --> 12:52.881
Go home. Why don't I call
that gal of yours, Sandy?

12:52.981 --> 12:56.381
Can't, she dumped me.

12:58.486 --> 13:00.964
Don't you worry about me.

13:01.072 --> 13:05.768
Hey, I'm gonna give you
a little extra something...

13:05.868 --> 13:11.099
because you took a
big chance talking to me.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.937
Pete, you're not gonna drive
in this condition, are you?

13:17.213 --> 13:22.365
I can't take this constant nagging.
I'm leaving you, Jerry.

13:22.468 --> 13:26.948
I'm leaving, and I'm taking
the monkey with me.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.206
Hey, I got a "what if."

14:12.310 --> 14:16.711
What if you and me
just drive up the coast...

14:16.814 --> 14:21.094
till the sun comes up
or the gas runs out?

14:21.194 --> 14:26.596
We change our names, start new lives...

14:28.326 --> 14:30.645
never come back.

14:32.121 --> 14:37.148
Sound good? Oh, you're just saying that.

14:40.838 --> 14:43.532
I'm talking to the monkey.

16:07.467 --> 16:11.412
Oh, my God! Okay. Okay, come on.

16:13.681 --> 16:15.124
It's okay. It'll be fine.

16:15.224 --> 16:19.420
It's gonna be fine. It's gonna be fine.

16:21.355 --> 16:22.627
It's gonna be...

16:27.987 --> 16:32.388
fine. Oh, shit!

16:32.492 --> 16:35.266
Come on. Come on!

16:41.792 --> 16:43.815
We got it. We got it.

16:50.134 --> 16:54.205
Jesus, no! God! Oh, God!

16:57.433 --> 17:02.505
Come on. What the hell?! Let me out!

17:07.026 --> 17:08.218
Help!

18:32.278 --> 18:38.226
Teddy, what you got there?
Teddy! Knock it off! Get out of there!

18:38.326 --> 18:40.349
What in God's name...?

18:45.374 --> 18:47.977
What in the hell happened to you, son?

18:49.128 --> 18:54.116
- I'm not exactly sure.
- You think you can sit up?

18:54.216 --> 18:56.159
I could try.

18:56.844 --> 18:59.038
Easy. Easy.

18:59.722 --> 19:01.119
Easy. All right.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.751
Oh, my God.

19:03.851 --> 19:06.879
Wait a minute.
Maybe you shouldn't stand.

19:06.979 --> 19:08.548
Do you wanna try it?

19:08.648 --> 19:10.132
Great God.

19:10.232 --> 19:12.969
Lordy, lordy, lordy.

19:13.069 --> 19:15.968
What in the hell...?

19:17.281 --> 19:21.561
The town is a fair piece down there.

19:21.661 --> 19:25.766
Do you wanna try walking?

19:26.832 --> 19:29.735
- Okay.
- You sure?

19:29.835 --> 19:32.863
All right, take it easy. Now, just go slow.

19:32.963 --> 19:35.236
Go slow, damn it.

19:39.553 --> 19:42.532
Oh, easy. Easy. Here, here.

19:42.640 --> 19:45.994
- Use that. I think it's clean.
- Thank you.

19:46.977 --> 19:51.958
You know, you seem an odd bit
familiar to me.

19:52.650 --> 19:55.128
Do I know you?

19:57.488 --> 20:02.264
I don't know. Do you?

20:08.249 --> 20:12.069
- It's so quiet.
- Yeah, well, it's early yet.

20:12.169 --> 20:17.696
Most folks is just waking up.
It's usually pretty quiet even then.

20:32.857 --> 20:37.383
That's Ernie Cole's place.
He's our druggist and mayor.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.929
Lost two boys in the war.

20:39.029 --> 20:42.224
Joe at Anzio and Willy at Bastogne.

20:43.826 --> 20:48.932
- They were good boys, both of them.
- There's so many.

20:49.039 --> 20:52.234
All told, this town gave 62...

20:52.334 --> 20:55.813
of its young men to the war.

20:55.921 --> 20:58.991
More than our share.
Seventeen of them at Normandy alone.

20:59.884 --> 21:02.988
Even got a letter from Roosevelt.

21:03.095 --> 21:06.248
They commissioned this town
a war memorial.

21:06.348 --> 21:10.669
Been in the basement of the
town hall for years now.

21:10.770 --> 21:13.419
Folks never had the heart to put it up.

21:14.064 --> 21:16.838
Mabel over at that diner...

21:16.942 --> 21:22.264
her husband Max was killed
in action on Okinawa.

21:24.784 --> 21:29.640
Say, son?
The woman does wonders with an egg.

21:30.706 --> 21:36.484
- You hungry?
- Yes. Very.

21:41.300 --> 21:45.287
Doc Stanton pops in every morning
on his way to the office.

21:45.387 --> 21:48.036
Let's have breakfast while we wait.

21:55.231 --> 21:57.333
Morning, Mabel.

21:58.943 --> 22:02.172
- My gosh.
- Doc been by yet?

22:02.279 --> 22:06.680
He should be along any moment.
Has there been an accident?

22:07.368 --> 22:11.564
I found him down by the wash.
He was lying there like a landed trout.

22:12.581 --> 22:13.816
Who is he?

22:13.916 --> 22:17.566
We're still working on that.
The boy could use a meal.

22:17.670 --> 22:19.943
Are those eggs spoken for?

22:20.631 --> 22:25.032
- Harry, you mind?
- No, not at all. I can wait.

22:35.187 --> 22:38.336
You trying to set a record?

22:41.777 --> 22:44.130
- It's good.
- Like you could tell.

22:50.035 --> 22:54.265
- Have you ever been in here before?
- I'd remember these eggs.

22:54.582 --> 22:59.358
- It's just that you look sort of...
- Familiar? I said the same thing.

23:00.170 --> 23:04.450
Hello, Stan. Mabel.
My bearclaw ready to go?

23:04.550 --> 23:07.494
There's someone you should say hello to.

23:07.595 --> 23:09.572
Hello, son.

23:10.598 --> 23:14.578
- How'd that happen?
- I have no idea.

23:18.606 --> 23:23.303
Perhaps you better come along with me.
Let me take a closer look at you.

23:34.496 --> 23:37.145
- On my tab?
- Of course.

23:41.629 --> 23:45.324
Food was wonderful. Thank you.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.401
My pleasure.

23:48.552 --> 23:50.871
Come again.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.959
Watch your step, son.

24:10.449 --> 24:14.679
Follow my finger. Just with your eyes.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.060
That's it.

24:28.509 --> 24:32.034
Muriel, call the sheriff.
Tell him we could use him.

24:32.137 --> 24:36.287
- Yes, doctor.
- So? Doc?

24:36.976 --> 24:39.420
What do you think?

24:39.520 --> 24:44.626
- I think he looks strangely...
- Familiar?

24:45.776 --> 24:50.006
- I'm getting that a lot lately.
- That's what Mabel and I said.

24:50.864 --> 24:56.846
- Vexing, isn't it?
- Aside from vexing, how am I?

24:56.954 --> 25:00.399
You took a pretty good knock
on the head. No doubt about that.

25:00.499 --> 25:03.569
Good news is, you'll live.

25:04.586 --> 25:06.905
Go ahead and put your shirt...

25:07.673 --> 25:10.117
Better yet... Excuse me, Stan.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.783
Take one of mine.

25:14.138 --> 25:17.538
Big, but it's clean.

25:19.893 --> 25:23.714
That's very kind. Thank you.

25:32.072 --> 25:36.473
- She's very pretty.
- That's my daughter, Adele.

25:36.577 --> 25:38.562
My pride and joy.

25:38.662 --> 25:42.392
Charms the fish right
out of the river, she does.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.403
Sorry, I didn't mean to stare.

25:46.503 --> 25:53.452
It's just that your face
really does seem familiar.

25:59.266 --> 26:02.119
Wish I could say the same thing.

26:16.575 --> 26:18.803
Cecil! Cecil, listen to me.

26:18.911 --> 26:22.686
Harry, you wanna give me
a heart attack right here?

26:23.040 --> 26:26.568
- There's a young man...
- I know, I'm here to investigate.

26:26.668 --> 26:29.446
Anything interesting
will be in the paper...

26:29.546 --> 26:33.150
Listen to me! It's Luke.

26:36.678 --> 26:42.000
You have no recollection
prior to waking up on our beach?

26:42.142 --> 26:45.045
No idea who you are or how you got here?

26:45.145 --> 26:51.048
I remember a dog licking my face.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.253
Before that...

26:55.489 --> 26:56.636
blank.

26:57.241 --> 27:00.811
There's someone who might
be able to shed light on this.

27:01.161 --> 27:03.889
- Is it okay if I bring him in?
- Please.

27:39.241 --> 27:40.433
It is you.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.934
It is.

27:45.581 --> 27:50.482
Oh, Luke. I never gave up hoping.

27:50.794 --> 27:56.071
You're alive! My boy! God!

27:58.677 --> 28:00.700
My son.

28:15.194 --> 28:17.388
Break it to her gently.

28:22.159 --> 28:23.852
Sir?

28:24.369 --> 28:28.895
- What did you say your name was?
- Harry.

28:29.458 --> 28:32.607
Harry Trimble. And you're Luke.

28:32.753 --> 28:35.606
Everybody's called you Luke
since you were a baby.

28:37.424 --> 28:40.619
Where exactly are we going?

28:40.719 --> 28:44.744
Where do you think, son?
I'm taking you home.

28:46.350 --> 28:48.953
You fellas have a good rest of the day.

28:49.061 --> 28:54.258
- If you need anything, call me.
- Bless you, Cecil, for everything.

29:05.827 --> 29:08.225
What are we doing here?

29:08.956 --> 29:10.933
This is it.

29:15.879 --> 29:18.778
"Hem Jesti."

29:18.882 --> 29:21.280
The Majestic.

29:22.094 --> 29:24.868
A few of the letters are missing.

29:26.932 --> 29:29.000
We live in a movie theater?

29:29.351 --> 29:33.797
No. In the apartment above it.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.235
Harry?

29:57.713 --> 30:00.407
How long have I been gone?

30:00.507 --> 30:03.156
Nine and a half years.

30:07.889 --> 30:11.038
Nine and a half years?

30:15.522 --> 30:17.750
That was high school.

30:18.567 --> 30:21.466
You ran 11 touchdowns that season.

30:30.078 --> 30:32.021
My mother?

30:32.748 --> 30:35.021
You remember?

30:36.168 --> 30:39.488
Just a guess.

30:42.591 --> 30:47.242
- She's beautiful.
- Yes, she was, rest her soul.

30:55.270 --> 30:59.716
I'm sorry. It's so much to take in.

31:00.317 --> 31:03.591
Me blathering away like a fool.

31:04.654 --> 31:07.303
Why don't I make some coffee?

31:36.645 --> 31:40.716
Harry, why did you close The Majestic?

31:40.816 --> 31:45.887
After the war, people here just
didn't feel like going to the movies.

31:45.987 --> 31:49.557
Some moved away. Los Angeles...

31:50.200 --> 31:53.429
Sacramento, San Francisco.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.186
You still take cream, no sugar?

32:00.794 --> 32:02.692
Luke?

34:23.645 --> 34:25.964
Just us, son.

34:26.731 --> 34:31.303
- How long have I been asleep?
- Since yesterday.

34:31.402 --> 34:34.052
You slept through the night
and most of this morning.

34:36.324 --> 34:40.929
I'd like to reintroduce you
to the staff of The Majestic.

34:41.036 --> 34:46.735
- Irene Tenuilliger, our candy lady.
- So glad to have you back, Luke.

34:46.835 --> 34:48.983
He's even more handsome now.

34:49.295 --> 34:53.071
This is Emmett Smith,
our head usher and fix-it man.

34:53.216 --> 34:55.569
Tell him about the watch.

34:55.677 --> 34:58.872
One step at a time.
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

34:58.972 --> 35:03.418
Luke...

35:03.685 --> 35:08.507
Fact is, we've been talking it over
while you slept, and...

35:08.607 --> 35:11.051
Well, good news, son.

35:11.151 --> 35:13.845
Now that you're back,
we've decided to reopen.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.553
Reopen?

35:17.949 --> 35:21.849
How hard can it be?
We fix the place up, sell tickets.

35:21.953 --> 35:24.977
Harry. Look around.

35:25.749 --> 35:28.147
- It's a dump.
- Told you so.

35:28.251 --> 35:32.697
I am looking around,
and all I see is potential.

35:32.797 --> 35:38.529
The place is ready to fall down.
All you'd have to do is give it a shove.

35:38.637 --> 35:44.459
You're wrong. You are.
I know she doesn't look like much now...

35:44.559 --> 35:47.913
but once...
Once, this place was like a palace.

35:48.021 --> 35:51.250
- Palace.
- That's why we called her Majestic.

35:51.358 --> 35:54.962
Any man, woman, child could buy
a ticket, walk in.

35:55.070 --> 36:00.301
Here they'd be, here we'd be.
Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. Enjoy the show.

36:00.408 --> 36:04.888
In they'd come, entering a palace.
Like a dream. Like in heaven.

36:04.996 --> 36:08.851
Maybe you had worries and problems,
but once you came in...

36:08.958 --> 36:12.483
they didn't matter anymore.
And you know why?

36:15.882 --> 36:20.658
Chaplin, that's why.
And Keaton, and Lloyd.

36:21.429 --> 36:25.955
Garbo, Gable, and Lombard.
And Jimmy Stewart, Jimmy Cagney.

36:26.101 --> 36:29.045
Fred and Ginger. They were gods!

36:29.604 --> 36:31.581
And they lived up there.

36:32.023 --> 36:34.342
That was Olympus.

36:34.484 --> 36:37.713
We felt so lucky just to be here.

36:38.113 --> 36:41.638
To have the privilege of watching them.

36:41.741 --> 36:45.141
This TV thing,
why stay home and watch a box?

36:45.245 --> 36:49.395
Convenience? You don't have
to dress up, you can sit there?

36:49.499 --> 36:53.445
You call that entertainment?
Alone in your living room?

36:53.545 --> 36:57.900
Where's the other people?
Where's the audience?

36:58.007 --> 37:00.109
Where's the magic?

37:00.969 --> 37:06.576
I'll tell you. In a place like this,
the magic is all around you.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.372
The trick is to see it.

37:10.645 --> 37:12.793
Luke...

37:12.897 --> 37:17.173
I think you loved The Majestic
even more than I did.

37:17.277 --> 37:20.677
- You've got to remember that.
- I don't.

37:22.532 --> 37:27.308
It sounds crazy, but I promise
we can make this place like it was!

37:27.412 --> 37:31.107
I don't know how it was.
Don't you get that?

37:31.207 --> 37:36.438
- None of this means anything to me!
- It used to mean so much.

37:36.546 --> 37:42.449
It doesn't. How can it?
Harry, I don't even know who I am.

37:44.304 --> 37:46.077
No.

37:48.808 --> 37:50.535
No.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.499
Come with me.

38:02.822 --> 38:06.059
Bobby Rilke. Red hair and freckles.

38:06.159 --> 38:10.435
Always charging up and down the street
on his bike, screaming.

38:10.538 --> 38:14.268
Scaring the crap out of the old ladies.

38:15.710 --> 38:17.938
Brad Hendersen.

38:19.047 --> 38:24.324
Virgil Toynbee. And Patrick Vitger.
He was on the football team with you.

38:26.763 --> 38:28.786
Stevie Wardlow.

38:30.266 --> 38:33.495
His old man was a drinker,
used to beat him.

38:33.603 --> 38:37.173
You'd bring him home,
we'd give him a hot meal.

38:37.398 --> 38:40.798
Kid practically lived with us
for a few years.

38:42.362 --> 38:47.263
He died on Saipan.
Silver Star for bravery.

38:48.743 --> 38:51.016
Teddy Parker.

38:51.120 --> 38:53.097
Jimmy Trask.

38:54.916 --> 38:57.735
And this boy over here...

38:59.546 --> 39:03.241
bright kid. Honor student.

39:03.633 --> 39:06.532
Joined up right after Pearl Harbor.

39:06.636 --> 39:11.708
Parachuted into France on D-Day,
June 6th, 1944.

39:12.642 --> 39:17.714
Three days later, his platoon
got pinned down by German artillery.

39:18.273 --> 39:23.925
They were nearly wiped out. Most boys
dead or wounded, torn up by the shells.

39:24.028 --> 39:26.301
But this fella here...

39:26.406 --> 39:31.512
carried the injured back
to safety, one by one.

39:32.203 --> 39:35.648
Always going back
till all men were accounted for.

39:35.790 --> 39:39.770
He never wavered. He just kept doing
what he had to do...

39:39.919 --> 39:42.488
until it got done.

39:52.223 --> 39:56.373
He was reported missing
in action a month later.

39:56.477 --> 39:59.501
His body was never found.

39:59.981 --> 40:06.009
Congress gave him the Medal of Honor
for saving the lives of eight men...

40:06.154 --> 40:07.801
without thought to himself.

40:23.922 --> 40:26.150
His name...

40:26.257 --> 40:29.987
was Albert Lucas Trimble.

40:31.846 --> 40:37.578
We called him Luke. He was my son.

40:42.649 --> 40:44.422
That's who you are.

40:49.197 --> 40:52.892
- Well, I'll be!
- Morning, Ernie.

40:53.034 --> 40:57.935
I heard about it, couldn't believe it.
I had to come see for myself.

40:58.039 --> 41:01.063
There he stands.
I still can't believe it!

41:01.167 --> 41:04.111
- It's really him.
- I can see that!

41:04.212 --> 41:09.409
My God, Luke, it sure is good
to see you again.

41:10.551 --> 41:14.076
- Luke, this is Ernie Cole, our mayor.
- Mayor Cole.

41:14.180 --> 41:18.660
You don't have to go that far, son.
You can just call me Ernie.

41:19.060 --> 41:22.664
- Care to join us for lunch?
- I'd love it.

41:22.772 --> 41:24.374
Good.

41:26.109 --> 41:28.011
Oh, my God!

41:31.572 --> 41:33.470
Watch your step.

41:39.247 --> 41:43.477
- Oh, I missed you.
- Not as much as I missed you.

41:43.584 --> 41:48.360
- Well? How did it go?
- Not so bad. I think I passed.

41:48.464 --> 41:54.871
- That's my girl! What about the...?
- Hiccups? Not a trace, thank goodness.

41:54.971 --> 41:57.081
Who wants an attorney who hiccups
when she's nervous?

42:00.017 --> 42:03.218
Like I always said, honey,
it's all up here.

42:04.605 --> 42:08.255
It's so good to be home.

42:10.653 --> 42:12.130
Dad, what is it?

42:14.782 --> 42:18.978
- Oh, my God. Did somebody die?
- Well...

42:19.662 --> 42:23.358
somewhat the opposite, actually.

42:23.458 --> 42:26.027
Look at you! Look at you!

42:29.505 --> 42:31.824
Great to have you back, son!

42:32.383 --> 42:33.868
Wonderful to have you back.

42:33.968 --> 42:40.451
Luke! Remember the time, you and me,
we were playing with firecrackers?

42:40.558 --> 42:44.295
One of them went off too soon
and singed all the hair off my head?

42:48.941 --> 42:50.964
No. What happened?

42:52.236 --> 42:55.966
Well, all the hair
got singed off my head...

42:57.283 --> 42:59.226
it was pretty funny.

43:00.369 --> 43:02.892
You really don't remember?

43:04.665 --> 43:06.642
I'm sorry.

43:07.543 --> 43:11.114
Heck, that's okay. It's good
to have you back, that's all.

43:13.049 --> 43:15.117
Ain't that right, Bob?

43:15.218 --> 43:20.074
Luke, you remember my cousin Bob?
You two joined up the same day.

43:20.181 --> 43:21.874
Bob, nice to meet you.

43:26.062 --> 43:28.130
Welcome back.

43:33.861 --> 43:35.929
Thank you.

43:41.202 --> 43:43.350
- More coffee?
- No, I'm fine.

43:43.454 --> 43:47.483
- What are your plans?
- We're gonna reopen The Majestic.

43:49.085 --> 43:51.779
- Is that right?
- We were discussing it.

43:51.879 --> 43:56.735
That's the spirit, fellas!
We need a little more of that.

43:58.886 --> 44:00.909
Where is Spencer Wyatt?

44:01.222 --> 44:03.324
- Spence?
- Spencer!

44:03.432 --> 44:06.456
- There he is.
- Come here.

44:08.813 --> 44:12.800
- Hey, Luke.
- Hi, Spencer.

44:12.900 --> 44:16.721
- Is your big band ready to play?
- Yes, sir.

44:16.821 --> 44:18.548
What are you thinking?

44:18.656 --> 44:24.479
This town has had a blessing
of good fortune after a long dry spell.

44:24.620 --> 44:27.482
I'm thinking that we ought to celebrate.

44:28.875 --> 44:32.695
So, what do you say?
Saturday night, out at the point...

44:32.795 --> 44:35.648
a big welcome-home celebration for Luke.

44:43.639 --> 44:45.161
No, it's too much.

44:56.903 --> 44:58.721
Luke?

45:05.620 --> 45:07.563
Adele?

45:10.917 --> 45:12.894
I saw your picture.

45:22.011 --> 45:24.239
Do you remember me?

45:25.973 --> 45:29.077
No, but I'll sure try.

45:38.778 --> 45:41.757
- Adele?
- Yes?

45:42.073 --> 45:44.676
It may just be my imagination...

45:46.160 --> 45:49.184
but I feel like we're not alone.

45:53.918 --> 45:57.488
Go about your business.
He's not going anywhere.

45:57.672 --> 46:02.278
It's okay, folks. Go ahead home.
And thanks for the welcome.

46:03.010 --> 46:06.535
You two have a lot
to catch up on, I expect.

46:11.060 --> 46:14.630
I think we'd better... Go on.

46:19.860 --> 46:21.837
You handled that well.

46:22.363 --> 46:24.010
Thanks.

46:25.366 --> 46:29.187
So, where to?

46:37.128 --> 46:39.822
Town hall?

46:42.091 --> 46:43.818
Come on.

46:48.514 --> 46:50.491
You first.

46:51.183 --> 46:52.535
Why me?

46:52.685 --> 46:55.459
In case the vicious guard dogs
haven't been fed.

46:56.856 --> 46:59.342
So you can be a gentleman
and help me down.

47:11.912 --> 47:13.514
Careful.

47:13.914 --> 47:16.062
There you go.

47:20.338 --> 47:22.361
I got you.

47:36.479 --> 47:38.627
Big, gloomy basement.

47:39.273 --> 47:41.296
Nice.

47:41.400 --> 47:44.549
It was a lot roomier before they put
the monument down here.

47:48.240 --> 47:54.473
The gift from Roosevelt.
Stan Keller told me about it.

48:08.302 --> 48:09.745
Your name's on there.

48:12.348 --> 48:14.875
So are the others.

48:14.975 --> 48:17.624
I knew all these guys?

48:18.687 --> 48:20.585
We both did.

48:20.940 --> 48:26.342
We went to school with most of them.
You really don't remember?

48:32.451 --> 48:34.474
I'm sorry.

48:34.703 --> 48:37.727
We used to sneak in here
when we were kids.

48:37.832 --> 48:41.527
This was our secret place.

48:41.627 --> 48:45.106
You, me, Stevie Wardlow...

48:46.006 --> 48:47.232
Tully Wentworth.

48:53.180 --> 48:58.127
- That's why you brought me here?
- It's a stroll down memory lane.

48:58.227 --> 49:01.171
Dad said if I took you places
we used to go...

49:01.272 --> 49:06.674
and showed you things only we
knew about, it might help you remember.

49:07.528 --> 49:11.053
So we're here for...

49:11.157 --> 49:14.477
purely medical reasons?

49:16.036 --> 49:18.605
Not entirely.

49:19.123 --> 49:23.148
I'm trying to make up my own mind
about you being Luke.

49:23.419 --> 49:25.738
Join the club.

49:26.881 --> 49:28.449
So, what do you think?

49:29.884 --> 49:32.407
The jury's still out.

49:33.429 --> 49:34.906
Fair enough.

49:38.601 --> 49:41.124
Any other secret places
I should know about?

49:48.068 --> 49:51.547
- Really, it fueled my dream.
- That can't be true.

49:51.655 --> 49:54.224
I'm serious.

49:55.367 --> 49:58.767
You'll have to start making sense
sometime soon.

49:58.871 --> 50:02.691
You wanted to be a lawyer
because of The Majestic?

50:02.791 --> 50:05.690
We used to go to the movies
all the time.

50:05.794 --> 50:10.616
Once, when I was 11, the movie
playing was The Life of Emile Zola.

50:10.758 --> 50:13.782
About the Dreyfus affair. Great picture.

50:13.928 --> 50:16.952
You remember movies,
but you don't remember your life?

50:20.351 --> 50:22.078
Yeah.

50:23.771 --> 50:27.125
- Weird, huh?
- It's unbelievable.

50:28.108 --> 50:34.341
In the movie, Zola stood up in court
and accused the French government...

50:34.448 --> 50:38.803
of forfeiting its honor
for wrongly accusing an innocent man.

50:38.953 --> 50:43.065
Zola wasn't a lawyer, of course,
but the way he spoke...

50:44.917 --> 50:48.772
I decided right then
that's what I wanted to be.

50:48.879 --> 50:53.109
- Just from that?
- Just? Come on, it was great!

50:53.217 --> 50:58.448
"In the presence of this tribunal,
the representative of human justice...

50:58.556 --> 51:03.252
before you, gentlemen of the jury,
before France, before the world...

51:03.352 --> 51:05.921
I swear that Dreyfus is innocent!

51:06.021 --> 51:10.376
By all I've won, all I've written
to spread the spirit of France...

51:10.484 --> 51:12.712
I swear, Dreyfus is innocent."

51:12.820 --> 51:18.051
"May all that melt away, may my name
perish if Dreyfus not be innocent."

51:18.158 --> 51:20.269
"He is innocent."

51:22.162 --> 51:24.481
It's pretty good stuff, huh?

51:25.666 --> 51:27.643
Not bad at all.

51:31.213 --> 51:35.193
The sun's going. Come on.

51:50.774 --> 51:52.626
Watch your eyes.

52:12.463 --> 52:16.659
- Is this another secret place?
- Our special one.

52:18.093 --> 52:21.868
We used to come up here all the time
to watch the sunset.

52:25.726 --> 52:28.249
And that's what made it special?

52:31.231 --> 52:34.130
This is also where we had
our first kiss.

52:36.111 --> 52:38.589
We were 14.

52:40.574 --> 52:42.267
Wow.

52:43.077 --> 52:44.804
That is special.

52:45.537 --> 52:47.856
Wish I could remember that.

52:50.042 --> 52:51.985
Me too.

52:53.921 --> 52:55.398
We were in love, weren't we?

52:57.424 --> 52:59.492
Yeah.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.997
- What was that?
- Oh. Nothing.

53:09.770 --> 53:12.339
- I'm fine. Really.
- You don't sound fine.

53:12.439 --> 53:15.418
Just ignore it. It's going away.

53:19.655 --> 53:21.632
So were we gonna be married?

53:22.991 --> 53:25.264
When you got back from overseas.

53:25.494 --> 53:26.645
We were engaged...

53:27.955 --> 53:29.557
just before you shipped out.

53:29.998 --> 53:32.897
Anything I can do to help you with that?

53:34.336 --> 53:38.532
Yeah. But it's something
that only we knew about.

53:38.632 --> 53:43.738
- Tell me.
- No. I think I'd rather die first.

53:43.846 --> 53:46.449
Your father said any little thing
could jog my memory.

54:06.785 --> 54:08.762
Hey.

54:10.080 --> 54:11.477
It still works.

55:29.076 --> 55:33.021
- Found me.
- Sorry. I didn't know who was here.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.974
Just me and the dog.

55:38.418 --> 55:41.397
- What's his name?
- Dog.

55:42.047 --> 55:45.447
- Simple. I like it.
- Come on in.

55:57.729 --> 56:03.507
- Is that you? In the first World War?
- Yeah. 1917, thereabouts.

56:04.236 --> 56:08.307
- It's okay with you that I live here?
- Why wouldn't it be?

56:08.699 --> 56:12.352
Just checking.
Think I'll get me a watch?

56:12.452 --> 56:17.308
Oh. Right, the watch. What's that for?

56:17.416 --> 56:23.023
So I make sure the shows always
start on time. That's important.

56:23.171 --> 56:26.696
- I'll see what I can do.
- Thank you.

56:27.634 --> 56:31.238
I had me a nice watch once.

56:31.847 --> 56:35.042
The pocket watch kind, with a chain.

56:35.142 --> 56:37.961
Kept good time until it broke.

56:38.687 --> 56:41.415
Never had the money to get it fixed.

56:42.065 --> 56:45.886
By then, the theater closed down,
I didn't think I needed it.

56:46.361 --> 56:49.089
I put it away somewhere for safekeeping.

56:49.364 --> 56:51.808
But that was years ago...

56:52.200 --> 56:55.349
and I can't remember where.

56:55.454 --> 57:00.355
Lost me a medal for bravery once too,
back during the Great War.

57:01.001 --> 57:05.652
Lost it in the hospital, I think.

57:06.590 --> 57:09.489
I forget things sometimes...

57:10.385 --> 57:12.829
since the war.

57:14.348 --> 57:16.166
Yeah...

57:16.850 --> 57:19.123
me too.

57:21.939 --> 57:26.260
Trash. Vile, despicable trash.

57:26.360 --> 57:30.090
It's about the West Virginia
coal miners' strike of 1920.

57:30.197 --> 57:33.597
The plight of the downtrodden worker
and all that.

57:33.700 --> 57:37.304
- Communist propaganda, start to end.
- That bad?

57:37.412 --> 57:40.937
There's a dog in it I like,
but aside from that...

57:41.041 --> 57:44.941
- Tell me about Appleton.
- His agent reported him missing.

57:45.045 --> 57:47.656
He's been gone four or five days.

57:47.756 --> 57:52.452
Four or five days? Gentlemen, we may
be onto something here.

57:52.552 --> 57:55.872
What kind of man hides
after being implicated?

57:55.973 --> 58:00.168
Not an innocent one. What if Appleton
is more than he seems?

58:00.268 --> 58:04.623
Not just another schmuck,
but an important Communist operative.

58:04.731 --> 58:06.799
One with lots of secrets to spill.

58:08.443 --> 58:11.387
The Reds would do anything
to keep him out of our hands.

58:14.199 --> 58:16.893
We have one of two scenarios here.

58:16.994 --> 58:22.851
Number one: His Communist friends
killed him to shut him up.

58:25.919 --> 58:29.944
Number two: They're trying to get him
out of the country as we speak.

58:32.384 --> 58:35.537
I don't intend
to open a copy of Pravda...

58:35.637 --> 58:38.911
and see him get a hero's welcome
in Red Square.

58:39.016 --> 58:42.916
- What shall we tell Mr. Hoover?
- Tell him this has top priority.

58:47.607 --> 58:50.551
You find him. Living or dead.

58:50.652 --> 58:52.971
Whatever it takes.

58:53.071 --> 58:56.425
His trail will lead us
to a nest of Communists...

58:56.533 --> 59:01.480
that will make the Rosenbergs
look like Ma and Pa Kettle.

59:03.874 --> 59:05.400
Adele!

59:05.500 --> 59:07.273
Got it!

59:11.840 --> 59:13.817
Hi.

59:17.387 --> 59:21.742
- Do I have a stain? What?
- Nothing.

59:22.476 --> 59:25.705
Seeing you there gave me
a weird feeling.

59:26.354 --> 59:30.584
- You wore that when we last went out.
- I could go change it.

59:30.692 --> 59:35.093
- Don't be silly. It still fits.
- You kids ready?

59:36.531 --> 59:37.883
Shall we?

59:49.127 --> 59:50.237
Hi.

59:50.337 --> 59:53.190
- Good evening.
- How are you?

59:55.050 --> 59:56.402
- Hi.
- Good evening.

59:56.510 --> 59:58.908
Smells good. I caught it from here.

01:00:05.519 --> 01:00:07.917
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

01:00:18.240 --> 01:00:20.843
Pennsylvania 6-5000!

01:00:21.701 --> 01:00:23.729
Luke's here!

01:00:23.829 --> 01:00:26.603
Here he comes! Here he comes!

01:00:26.706 --> 01:00:28.683
I'll be right back.

01:00:33.004 --> 01:00:35.607
Hey, buddy. We'll take it from here.

01:01:12.419 --> 01:01:14.487
I'll get you for that.

01:01:15.297 --> 01:01:19.868
I think Luke and Adele should lead
the first dance, don't you?

01:01:41.198 --> 01:01:43.096
Care to dance?

01:01:44.492 --> 01:01:48.187
- I think we'd better.
- PETER:

01:02:19.319 --> 01:02:21.672
You're pretty good.

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:23.423
Thanks.

01:02:23.949 --> 01:02:25.642
You too.

01:02:27.327 --> 01:02:29.896
When did you learn to dance?

01:02:47.847 --> 01:02:50.450
That was nerve-racking.

01:02:50.558 --> 01:02:54.788
I'd kill that Spencer kid,
except he's really good.

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:59.130
- Looks like your investment paid off.
- Investment?

01:02:59.276 --> 01:03:02.550
In high school,
you saved up for a clarinet.

01:03:02.654 --> 01:03:05.507
You wanted to be Benny Goodman
in the worst way.

01:03:06.366 --> 01:03:08.810
- And?
- You were Benny Goodman...

01:03:08.910 --> 01:03:11.638
- ...in the worst way.
- Ouch.

01:03:11.955 --> 01:03:14.399
You gave the clarinet to Spencer.

01:03:14.499 --> 01:03:19.355
He used to drive you crazy,
following you around like a lost puppy.

01:03:19.462 --> 01:03:24.113
I gave him the clarinet.
He started practicing and left me alone.

01:03:24.259 --> 01:03:28.830
- Did you remember that, or...?
- Just filling in the blanks.

01:03:58.084 --> 01:04:00.232
Aren't they a sight?

01:04:01.129 --> 01:04:03.357
So they are, Harry.

01:04:04.591 --> 01:04:05.738
Something wrong?

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.295
Something is troubling me.

01:04:17.437 --> 01:04:19.960
What could trouble you
on a night like this?

01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:24.386
Just look.
Your daughter, dancing with my son.

01:04:24.486 --> 01:04:28.636
Everything the way it should be.
God's in his heaven, Ben.

01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:33.687
Still, I can't help wondering,
where has Luke been all this time?

01:04:33.787 --> 01:04:38.733
- I mean, 9-and-a-half years!
- What's it matter? He's home now.

01:04:38.833 --> 01:04:41.937
He went missing during the war, right?

01:04:42.045 --> 01:04:46.616
So he must have been injured overseas,
lost his memory then.

01:04:46.716 --> 01:04:52.118
So, what happened when he came back,
not knowing who he was?

01:04:52.222 --> 01:04:56.498
Did he start a new life for himself?
Career?

01:04:56.601 --> 01:05:02.299
What if Luke spent the last decade
actually thinking he's somebody else?

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.760
I don't care.
I care about his life here.

01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:10.215
But don't you see?
He might have people looking for him.

01:05:10.323 --> 01:05:14.599
People who care about him.
Maybe even a wife and family.

01:05:15.495 --> 01:05:19.190
You could be a grandfather
and not even know it.

01:05:20.583 --> 01:05:25.063
I'm not trying to step on your joy.
My joy too.

01:05:26.172 --> 01:05:29.367
But what happens
if his memory does come back?

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:32.454
Which life will he remember?

01:05:33.555 --> 01:05:35.828
Which would he choose?

01:06:01.249 --> 01:06:05.111
- So are you proud of your boy, Avery?
- What?

01:06:06.671 --> 01:06:10.241
Oh, yeah!
I couldn't be any more proud, Ernie.

01:06:10.341 --> 01:06:14.954
I think Spencer's got a big future
ahead of him. What do you say?

01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.208
Whoo!

01:06:21.227 --> 01:06:25.048
You know, folks, here in Lawson...

01:06:25.148 --> 01:06:28.468
we gave a lotto our country. A lot.

01:06:28.568 --> 01:06:31.922
And we never complained.

01:06:32.030 --> 01:06:34.383
And we never faltered.

01:06:35.116 --> 01:06:37.514
And we never forgot.

01:06:39.954 --> 01:06:42.648
We never forgot.

01:06:42.957 --> 01:06:46.482
And so, when one of our own...

01:06:46.628 --> 01:06:49.356
came back to us, it was like a miracle.

01:06:49.464 --> 01:06:51.237
Luke...

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:56.864
seeing you walk down
the street, it was...

01:06:57.472 --> 01:07:01.543
it was kind of like seeing
one of my own boys alive again.

01:07:02.268 --> 01:07:06.589
I think I speak for all of us here
when I say...

01:07:06.689 --> 01:07:09.008
that not a day goes by...

01:07:09.108 --> 01:07:12.508
that we don't keep
our boys' memories alive.

01:07:13.738 --> 01:07:17.718
But, Luke, having you back among us...

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:22.021
that helps us keep
their spirits alive too.

01:07:22.121 --> 01:07:24.599
God bless you, son. God bless you.

01:07:32.674 --> 01:07:35.573
Now, on a lighter note...

01:07:35.677 --> 01:07:39.873
we've had a special request
from one of Lawson's luminaries...

01:07:39.973 --> 01:07:44.169
Irene Terwilliger. Irene, come up here.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:48.248
There you are.

01:07:49.983 --> 01:07:52.632
I've tutored music in this town...

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:56.089
for more years than I care to say.

01:07:56.906 --> 01:08:02.353
In fact, many of you here tonight have
been my students through the years.

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:05.602
And as talented as you all were...

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:09.107
the most talented pupil I ever taught...

01:08:09.377 --> 01:08:12.321
was Luke Trimble.

01:08:20.013 --> 01:08:24.243
Luke, you played the piano
like an angel.

01:08:24.350 --> 01:08:28.421
It would do my heart a world of good
to hear you play again.

01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:30.715
Won't you come up?

01:08:30.857 --> 01:08:33.551
- Yes, come up!
- Come on!

01:08:33.651 --> 01:08:35.053
Come.

01:08:40.783 --> 01:08:45.104
- You never told me about the piano.
- Go. Anything could jog your memory.

01:08:49.584 --> 01:08:51.527
That's right.

01:09:08.603 --> 01:09:13.675
I'm not sure I remember ever playing.

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:19.176
Music is in the soul, Luke.
Just put your fingers on the keys...

01:09:19.656 --> 01:09:22.054
and let it all come back to you.

01:09:22.158 --> 01:09:27.229
Franz Liszt. Hungarian Rhapsody No. 2.

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.814
Like this. Follow me.

01:09:48.309 --> 01:09:50.411
Now you.

01:11:25.072 --> 01:11:29.803
Really, Luke! That's no way
to treat Mr. Liszt. Stop that!

01:11:30.369 --> 01:11:32.767
Stop it, I say!

01:11:32.872 --> 01:11:37.022
Who taught you to play like that?
I demand to know!

01:11:37.126 --> 01:11:40.651
Where did you learn
to play such a thing?

01:11:40.755 --> 01:11:43.574
I taught him that!
When you weren't looking.

01:12:12.954 --> 01:12:16.023
- I think Spencer was loopy.
- No.

01:12:16.123 --> 01:12:20.444
He was blowing some bad notes
there at the end.

01:12:46.112 --> 01:12:48.214
Good night.

01:12:50.241 --> 01:12:52.184
Good night.

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:31.136
Bob?

01:13:36.454 --> 01:13:39.440
Bob Leffert.
You work for Mabel at the diner.

01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:42.484
That's who I am.
Question is, who are you?

01:13:43.544 --> 01:13:47.023
- I'm not sure what you mean.
- I knew Luke Trimble.

01:13:48.424 --> 01:13:50.618
I didn't like him much.

01:13:50.718 --> 01:13:54.539
Not saying he's bad,
just rubbed me the wrong way.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:59.373
You know the feeling? Someone rubs you
the wrong way, you can't explain why?

01:14:00.394 --> 01:14:04.340
You kind of rub me that way.
Not that that makes you Luke.

01:14:05.232 --> 01:14:09.758
What I want to know is, what game
are you running? Who are you?

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.385
Just a guy trying to figure things out.

01:14:13.783 --> 01:14:16.306
This town's had enough heartbreak.

01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.222
Too much.

01:14:20.039 --> 01:14:23.313
Me, I think you're setting
everybody up for more.

01:14:26.837 --> 01:14:29.360
I hope I'm wrong.

01:14:29.507 --> 01:14:32.907
I haven't had to kill anybody
since the war.

01:14:38.265 --> 01:14:40.959
Why didn't you dance with her?

01:14:41.894 --> 01:14:44.088
Excuse me?

01:14:45.314 --> 01:14:48.964
Mabel. Why didn't you dance with her?

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:52.012
Seems to me, a pretty girl asks you
to dance and you say no...

01:14:53.406 --> 01:14:55.634
you came home more crippled
than you thought.

01:15:06.711 --> 01:15:08.529
Hero.

01:15:27.189 --> 01:15:29.337
Welcome home, Luke.

01:17:00.366 --> 01:17:03.891
This was the first movie
we ever showed here.

01:17:03.994 --> 01:17:06.768
Your mother loved it.
I bought the print.

01:17:06.872 --> 01:17:10.351
Cost us our first month's profits.

01:17:10.459 --> 01:17:13.187
That was back in 1925.

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:17.738
Before sound.
You were just a little kid then.

01:17:19.218 --> 01:17:21.787
Dad, I...

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:24.790
What?

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:29.291
That's the first time you've called me
Dad since you've been back.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.725
You know...

01:18:09.393 --> 01:18:10.540
Harry.

01:18:13.397 --> 01:18:15.340
Dad.

01:18:16.942 --> 01:18:18.840
Wake up.

01:18:19.570 --> 01:18:22.719
- What time is it?
- 6:30.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:26.059
I thought we'd get an early start.

01:18:26.660 --> 01:18:28.307
Candy counter.

01:18:40.007 --> 01:18:42.280
Display wiring needs help.

01:18:44.553 --> 01:18:47.122
Should have stayed in bed.

01:19:04.073 --> 01:19:08.553
The livestock were reportedly uninjured,
but very frightened.

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:13.482
The council acknowledged that
a bake sale should be scheduled.

01:19:13.582 --> 01:19:17.562
The motion was carried.
The meeting was adjourned.

01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:19.443
Thank you, Vera.

01:19:19.546 --> 01:19:23.116
The chair notes the presence
of the Trimbles...

01:19:23.384 --> 01:19:27.705
and the rest of The Majestic staff.
Come on up, folks.

01:19:30.599 --> 01:19:34.545
What brings you here?
An interest in Lawson politics?

01:19:34.645 --> 01:19:37.919
No, sir.
We're here on business of a sort.

01:19:38.023 --> 01:19:42.299
Point of order, this comes under
the heading of "new business."

01:19:42.653 --> 01:19:48.101
- We can make an exception, Daley.
- But it has to be moved and seconded.

01:19:52.454 --> 01:19:55.228
- Motion to hear the speaker.
- Seconded.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:59.278
Motion on the floor. Discussion open
and closed. Those in favor say "aye."

01:19:59.378 --> 01:20:00.650
Aye.

01:20:00.754 --> 01:20:03.733
Hearing no opposition,
the motion is carried.

01:20:04.425 --> 01:20:05.822
Go ahead, son.

01:20:06.510 --> 01:20:11.957
The Majestic needs a lot of repairs,
and we can't possibly afford them all.

01:20:12.057 --> 01:20:17.459
We'd like permission to scrounge
around for surplus materials.

01:20:17.563 --> 01:20:22.801
I could donate things from the
hardware store and Spencer could help.

01:20:22.901 --> 01:20:25.221
Thanks, Avery. That's kind.

01:20:25.321 --> 01:20:29.892
Oh, please. That clarinet's the best thing
that ever happened to my boy.

01:20:29.992 --> 01:20:32.515
- Brought him out of his shell.
- Sure.

01:20:32.619 --> 01:20:35.518
Motion to encourage
the citizens of Lawson...

01:20:35.622 --> 01:20:38.150
to help out The Majestic if they can.

01:20:38.250 --> 01:20:39.360
Seconded.

01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:44.406
Motion on the floor. Discussion open
and closed. Those in favor say "aye."

01:20:44.506 --> 01:20:45.653
Aye.

01:20:46.050 --> 01:20:50.371
Congratulations, Luke, Harry.
Where would you like to start?

01:20:50.804 --> 01:20:52.747
Your basement.

01:20:52.848 --> 01:20:55.747
Paint, paint and more paint.

01:20:56.643 --> 01:21:01.294
I didn't even know all this stuff
was down here. Take what you can use.

01:21:04.860 --> 01:21:07.804
Harry, Emmett, grab the other end.

01:21:11.158 --> 01:21:14.102
It should be outside
where it can be seen.

01:21:14.203 --> 01:21:16.351
Luke, we're good on this end.

01:21:18.707 --> 01:21:21.651
Ready? Let's go.

01:21:46.276 --> 01:21:48.629
Thank you!

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:01.149
For me?

01:22:11.427 --> 01:22:15.953
- Ready?
- Yeah. One, two, three.

01:22:21.228 --> 01:22:22.796
Shut it off!

01:23:02.895 --> 01:23:04.542
Oh, yeah!

01:23:06.523 --> 01:23:09.718
- Pull!
- Come on, move!

01:23:09.985 --> 01:23:12.759
- Pull!
- It's a heavy one!

01:23:12.863 --> 01:23:16.263
- Pull!
- Come on, guys, help me out.

01:23:16.783 --> 01:23:18.180
I pulled something!

01:23:26.168 --> 01:23:27.861
Come on.

01:24:25.185 --> 01:24:28.414
Joey, come look at this!

01:24:28.522 --> 01:24:31.842
Joey! Quick, come look!

01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:52.730
There's no way that that car
was driven onto this beach.

01:24:52.838 --> 01:24:56.067
- There's no access.
- So how did it get here?

01:24:56.216 --> 01:24:59.570
It fell in the river
and was washed out here.

01:24:59.678 --> 01:25:02.247
- River?
- We got two or three of them...

01:25:02.347 --> 01:25:06.327
dumping into this ocean along
the coast. Up north of here.

01:25:15.360 --> 01:25:17.212
Thanks.

01:25:18.030 --> 01:25:23.101
Oh. Thanks. Got something nice
to wear for the big reopening?

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:24.644
You bet.

01:25:25.746 --> 01:25:29.396
I don't think Bob's
doing anything that night.

01:25:29.541 --> 01:25:34.021
- Pretty sure I'm busy.
- Oh. Too bad.

01:25:34.129 --> 01:25:37.699
You should see the place,
it's coming together.

01:25:40.594 --> 01:25:43.868
- Come on, Carl, don't tease us.
- Go ahead.

01:25:55.776 --> 01:25:57.878
We did it, Dad.

01:25:59.488 --> 01:26:00.931
It's beautiful!

01:26:10.207 --> 01:26:12.105
Nifty?

01:26:12.626 --> 01:26:14.478
Yeah.

01:26:30.977 --> 01:26:34.081
Let us all join together now...

01:26:34.648 --> 01:26:37.877
in silent reflection...

01:26:39.611 --> 01:26:42.339
in loving memory...

01:26:42.698 --> 01:26:46.473
of those not with us.

01:27:58.315 --> 01:28:02.170
- Where is he? We have to open.
- He's a little nervous.

01:28:02.277 --> 01:28:05.256
- He's nervous?
- I think he's coming.

01:28:06.364 --> 01:28:07.557
Give this to him.

01:28:07.657 --> 01:28:10.306
- No, no, no.
- You bought it.

01:28:13.914 --> 01:28:15.061
Wow.

01:28:16.583 --> 01:28:18.731
- Damn.
- You think?

01:28:18.835 --> 01:28:20.903
Fits you like always.

01:28:21.004 --> 01:28:24.984
I put on a few pounds since.
Adele let it out.

01:28:25.091 --> 01:28:27.489
She did a fine job.

01:28:28.804 --> 01:28:32.625
Oh. Emmett...

01:28:33.892 --> 01:28:38.998
- ...this is really Luke's doing.
- It's from all of us.

01:28:46.154 --> 01:28:47.506
Oh, my!

01:28:49.950 --> 01:28:52.769
So you can make sure
we always get started on time.

01:28:54.955 --> 01:28:56.853
This is...

01:28:57.082 --> 01:28:58.855
This is very fine.

01:29:04.714 --> 01:29:06.657
Very fine, indeed.

01:29:08.677 --> 01:29:09.994
Ready to man your post?

01:29:37.497 --> 01:29:40.976
- Let's show some movies.
- All right.

01:29:43.044 --> 01:29:46.573
- Ernie, Joanne.
- Good evening. How are you, Harry?

01:29:46.673 --> 01:29:48.775
Thanks.

01:29:52.554 --> 01:29:54.748
I have the honor of being first.

01:29:54.848 --> 01:29:57.542
- Two adults?
- That's right.

01:30:01.396 --> 01:30:03.999
- Enjoy the movie.
- Thank you.

01:30:14.451 --> 01:30:17.475
- Two, please.
- You old enough for this one?

01:30:17.704 --> 01:30:23.106
Good evening, Dolores. How are you?
Fred, it's good to see you. Enjoy.

01:30:23.877 --> 01:30:25.945
Thank you for coming, Tom.

01:30:26.046 --> 01:30:29.992
- How are you? How are the children?
- They're fine.

01:30:30.300 --> 01:30:33.074
Good evening, how are you?

01:30:38.224 --> 01:30:41.749
Better hurry in there.
The movie is about to begin.

01:30:41.853 --> 01:30:44.877
- You'll like this one.
- Okay.

01:30:52.697 --> 01:30:53.969
Two, please.

01:31:01.873 --> 01:31:03.725
Yes, sir.

01:31:07.295 --> 01:31:08.738
Enjoy the show.

01:31:20.225 --> 01:31:23.579
- Hi. Two, please.
- How are you tonight?

01:31:31.027 --> 01:31:36.429
We have come to visit you in peace,
and with goodwill.

01:32:14.446 --> 01:32:15.672
Hey.

01:32:16.031 --> 01:32:17.428
Hey.

01:32:19.743 --> 01:32:20.890
What are you up to?

01:32:25.415 --> 01:32:29.861
"Adele Louise Stanton has passed
the State Bar Examination."

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:31.196
Wow!

01:32:31.296 --> 01:32:33.649
Does this mean you're qualified
to tend bar?

01:32:36.885 --> 01:32:38.533
You.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.833
I'm so proud of you.

01:33:24.891 --> 01:33:28.666
Luke, dear, we need to
order some more Raisinets.

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.839
And Jujubes.

01:33:30.939 --> 01:33:34.509
Raisinets and Jujubes. Check.

01:33:37.529 --> 01:33:41.179
Oh, and Moon Pies.

01:33:41.699 --> 01:33:43.597
MoonPies.

01:33:47.163 --> 01:33:51.894
- Having a run on candy?
- People have a sweet tooth at movies.

01:33:52.001 --> 01:33:54.069
Speaking of which...

01:33:59.717 --> 01:34:03.538
- Father, did we lose them?
- I think so.

01:34:03.638 --> 01:34:06.617
Let's see about getting
those manacles off.

01:34:09.894 --> 01:34:13.423
- Where are we?
- The inner chamber.

01:34:13.523 --> 01:34:16.092
We found it at last.

01:34:16.234 --> 01:34:17.506
Gosh!

01:34:18.528 --> 01:34:20.005
Who is that?

01:34:20.655 --> 01:34:27.104
That, my dear, is Horus.
The falcon-headed god of the heavens!

01:34:35.128 --> 01:34:37.606
The lovely Emily. My desert dove.

01:34:41.467 --> 01:34:45.371
Did you think you could
just fly away from me?

01:34:45.471 --> 01:34:48.825
- Hands off, Khalid!
- Roland!

01:34:50.393 --> 01:34:54.543
- You! I thought you were dead.
- You thought wrong.

01:35:03.448 --> 01:35:08.429
- Let her go.
- I find your persistence tiresome.

01:35:08.536 --> 01:35:10.354
I get that a lot.

01:35:17.795 --> 01:35:20.148
Roland, look out!

01:35:32.227 --> 01:35:37.549
- Come on, Khalid.
- I'll make sure you're dead.

01:35:37.649 --> 01:35:43.506
- Taste my steel, you dog.
- Taste my steel, you dog.

01:35:54.374 --> 01:35:56.772
- Curses on you...
- Curses on you...

01:35:56.876 --> 01:35:58.649
- ...infidel.
- ...infidel.

01:36:09.514 --> 01:36:12.117
- Oh, Roland.
- Oh, Emily.

01:36:12.517 --> 01:36:14.540
Oh, shit!

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:43.031
- Father, are you all right?
- Just a nasty bump. I'll be fine.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:44.866
- Khalid?
- He's dead.

01:36:44.966 --> 01:36:48.036
Brave work. Does he have the map?

01:36:48.720 --> 01:36:54.452
- Here. Right here.
- This is the inner chamber!

01:36:55.768 --> 01:37:00.920
Which means that in that statue lies
the secret of the Pharaoh's jewel.

01:37:08.448 --> 01:37:10.391
Luke, something's wrong!

01:37:11.034 --> 01:37:13.019
- Harry missed the reel change.
- What?

01:37:13.119 --> 01:37:16.223
Harry missed the reel change.

01:37:24.088 --> 01:37:25.485
Harry?

01:37:30.720 --> 01:37:33.539
Harry. Jesus!

01:37:38.269 --> 01:37:40.212
Go get Doc!

01:37:43.107 --> 01:37:47.383
Doc! Doc! Harry's in trouble!
Come quick!

01:37:47.487 --> 01:37:49.305
Excuse me.

01:37:49.697 --> 01:37:55.270
- Oh, no. No.
- What, Harry? What?

01:37:55.787 --> 01:38:01.235
- I missed the damn reel change.
- It's all right.

01:38:03.044 --> 01:38:07.991
You just lay still. Doc's on his way.

01:38:09.884 --> 01:38:11.861
I'm here.

01:38:29.529 --> 01:38:31.597
He's asking for you.

01:38:37.245 --> 01:38:40.019
- How is he?
- Well...

01:38:41.040 --> 01:38:45.611
He's had a massive heart attack.
His lungs have filled with fluid.

01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:50.362
His whole body is just shutting down.

01:38:51.509 --> 01:38:53.953
Can we get him to a hospital?

01:38:54.053 --> 01:38:59.205
Even if we could, there's nothing
they can do for him that we can't.

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:05.627
There's not much time.

01:39:32.717 --> 01:39:34.535
Did you?

01:39:35.845 --> 01:39:37.288
Did you?

01:39:38.973 --> 01:39:44.045
- Did I what?
- Get the last reel up?

01:39:44.353 --> 01:39:47.423
Oh. Oh, no.

01:39:51.152 --> 01:39:54.096
- Everybody went home.
- Oh.

01:39:55.740 --> 01:40:02.064
How will people know how the movie ends?
Good little picture too.

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:04.015
Damn shame.

01:40:04.123 --> 01:40:06.271
Now I'll never...

01:40:06.542 --> 01:40:09.145
see how it turns out.

01:40:11.964 --> 01:40:14.112
The good guy wins.

01:40:16.469 --> 01:40:20.824
Good. That's good.

01:40:22.808 --> 01:40:25.787
Good guys should always win.

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:34.796
Don't think about the movie.
You just hang on, okay?

01:40:35.238 --> 01:40:40.094
- Hang on, Harry.
- It's okay.

01:40:42.370 --> 01:40:44.472
If I have to go...

01:40:44.580 --> 01:40:49.231
at least I'm going in my own bed...

01:40:50.753 --> 01:40:56.030
and knowing my son is alive.

01:40:58.970 --> 01:41:01.744
That's not too shabby, is it?

01:41:06.561 --> 01:41:08.459
Harry...

01:41:10.398 --> 01:41:12.796
I'm not...

01:41:21.701 --> 01:41:24.270
Not ready to say goodbye.

01:41:26.497 --> 01:41:28.224
It's all right.

01:41:30.001 --> 01:41:36.484
It's all right. You're here.
And that's all that matters.

01:41:38.509 --> 01:41:40.703
Oh, God.

01:41:43.055 --> 01:41:45.908
I love you, son.

01:41:53.274 --> 01:41:54.842
I love you...

01:41:59.322 --> 01:42:01.140
Dad.

01:42:15.546 --> 01:42:19.822
So much...

01:42:24.388 --> 01:42:26.365
lighter.

01:42:54.293 --> 01:42:58.739
Surely goodness and mercy will
follow me all the days of my life...

01:42:58.839 --> 01:43:04.036
and I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

01:43:42.133 --> 01:43:43.450
Hey.

01:43:45.636 --> 01:43:47.283
Hey, yourself.

01:43:48.222 --> 01:43:50.416
I was looking for you.

01:43:51.559 --> 01:43:53.081
You okay?

01:43:54.895 --> 01:43:58.465
Well, I may be many things...

01:43:59.024 --> 01:44:02.253
but "okay" is far from one of them.

01:44:03.362 --> 01:44:05.885
Well, you want to talk about it?

01:44:28.679 --> 01:44:30.122
Luke...

01:44:32.349 --> 01:44:34.668
Look, I know this...

01:44:34.977 --> 01:44:38.251
I know this can't be
an easy day for you...

01:44:38.355 --> 01:44:40.799
You have no idea.

01:44:46.363 --> 01:44:51.560
Your father said I would
start to remember things.

01:44:55.206 --> 01:44:57.149
And?

01:44:58.918 --> 01:45:01.020
He was right.

01:45:03.464 --> 01:45:09.287
Adele, Harry wasn't my father.

01:45:10.554 --> 01:45:12.873
I'm not Luke.

01:45:26.737 --> 01:45:28.259
I'm sorry.

01:45:31.951 --> 01:45:34.224
Oh, my God.

01:45:35.704 --> 01:45:37.681
I knew.

01:45:39.291 --> 01:45:42.440
I knew, I knew it from the start.

01:45:44.922 --> 01:45:47.525
I wanted you to be Luke.

01:45:49.635 --> 01:45:52.079
I wanted you to be alive.

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:56.580
God, you are so much like him.
You have no idea.

01:45:59.061 --> 01:46:01.539
You don't know what you...

01:46:02.147 --> 01:46:04.466
What Luke...

01:46:05.568 --> 01:46:10.720
What Luke meant to this town,
suddenly being alive.

01:46:12.491 --> 01:46:15.595
You don't know what this town lost.

01:46:23.586 --> 01:46:26.781
God! I feel so stupid.

01:46:27.131 --> 01:46:28.824
I knew you weren't Luke.

01:46:29.717 --> 01:46:32.616
I let myself think that...

01:46:35.514 --> 01:46:39.001
And I tried not to fall
in love with you, I did!

01:46:39.101 --> 01:46:40.999
I don't even know your name.

01:46:41.103 --> 01:46:44.173
- I'll tell you.
- No, don't! Whoever you are...

01:46:44.523 --> 01:46:49.345
I can't. I just...
I need to be by myself, okay?

01:46:49.445 --> 01:46:50.592
Adele, please.

01:46:51.989 --> 01:46:53.636
Adele!

01:47:30.027 --> 01:47:31.136
That's him.

01:47:31.236 --> 01:47:34.135
- Just stay back, folks.
- There he is.

01:47:45.417 --> 01:47:48.942
I'm Sheriff Coleman.
What's going on here?

01:47:49.046 --> 01:47:53.242
Federal agents.
We're here to serve a subpoena on him.

01:47:53.342 --> 01:47:54.534
Luke Trimble?

01:47:54.677 --> 01:47:58.998
I don't know what he's told you,
but he's not Luke Trimble.

01:48:06.647 --> 01:48:12.970
You are commanded to appear before the
Committee on Un-American Activities...

01:48:13.070 --> 01:48:15.764
in special session in Los Angeles...

01:48:16.073 --> 01:48:20.929
and there testify on matters of
Communist conspiracy and subversion.

01:48:21.912 --> 01:48:23.685
Herein fail not.

01:48:31.755 --> 01:48:35.485
- Am I under arrest?
- If you're not on that train.

01:48:35.592 --> 01:48:39.868
Fellas, I'm here to guarantee
his return. That was the deal.

01:48:40.514 --> 01:48:43.914
Now, unless there's some law
that's been broken...

01:48:44.018 --> 01:48:47.998
I'd have to say that doesn't
appear to be the case.

01:48:48.105 --> 01:48:50.424
Appearances are tricky.

01:48:50.524 --> 01:48:55.930
We'll just canvass the town,
ask questions, check backgrounds.

01:48:56.030 --> 01:48:57.973
That sort of thing.

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.552
Come on, son.

01:49:50.375 --> 01:49:53.854
Come on, Mabel. Come on.
It's not worth it.

01:50:38.173 --> 01:50:41.948
Well, why don't we call it a night?

01:50:43.220 --> 01:50:45.322
I'll close up.

01:50:48.058 --> 01:50:51.958
- Come on, Irene, I'll walk you home.
- Thank you, Emmett.

01:50:52.062 --> 01:50:54.798
What did you expect? Big turnout?

01:50:56.275 --> 01:51:00.721
These aren't your people.
This isn't your town. L.A. is.

01:51:00.821 --> 01:51:06.268
- Not when the Committee gets through.
- I've been on with our lawyers all day.

01:51:06.368 --> 01:51:09.392
- They've been on with their lawyers.
- So?

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:14.818
They hate to admit it, but you're
not the top Commie spy they thought.

01:51:14.960 --> 01:51:18.314
- Gee, there's a relief.
- Hey, a break's a break.

01:51:18.422 --> 01:51:22.823
They're anxious to save face
after the big stink they made...

01:51:22.926 --> 01:51:25.779
which means they might be
in a mood to compromise.

01:51:28.098 --> 01:51:31.452
The studio lawyers had this drawn up.

01:51:35.606 --> 01:51:41.588
"I, Peter Appleton, by way of purging
myself of my indiscretions...

01:51:41.695 --> 01:51:45.675
renounce my membership
in the Communist Party...

01:51:45.782 --> 01:51:48.977
and provide the names
of fellow members...

01:51:49.077 --> 01:51:54.066
that those persons may have
the opportunity to do as I have done."

01:51:54.166 --> 01:51:58.817
Boilerplate, kid.
They even provided the list of names.

01:52:00.088 --> 01:52:05.911
- I don't know any of these people.
- Doesn't matter. They're already named.

01:52:06.011 --> 01:52:11.083
All you do is show up,
read the statement, salute the flag.

01:52:11.225 --> 01:52:14.169
- I won't be a Communist anymore?
- That's it.

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:20.217
- Does it matter that I never was one?
- Don't split hairs. This is a game.

01:52:20.317 --> 01:52:22.215
But it's their game.

01:52:22.319 --> 01:52:25.923
You play by their rules,
or they'll destroy you.

01:52:26.031 --> 01:52:28.350
I thought this was a democracy.

01:52:28.450 --> 01:52:32.054
The Declaration of Independence?
The Constitution?

01:52:32.162 --> 01:52:35.812
Just pieces of paper
with signatures on them.

01:52:35.916 --> 01:52:39.736
And you know what
a signed paper is? A contract.

01:52:39.836 --> 01:52:43.657
Something that can be
renegotiated at any time.

01:52:43.757 --> 01:52:49.955
Just so happens HUAC is renegotiating
the contract this time around.

01:52:50.055 --> 01:52:54.626
Next time it'll be somebody else,
but it'll always be somebody.

01:52:54.726 --> 01:52:56.999
You want your life back?

01:52:57.771 --> 01:52:59.418
Read the statement.

01:53:03.694 --> 01:53:07.469
I'll see you at the station, kid,
bright and early.

01:53:32.681 --> 01:53:36.251
You think they'll come back?
The customers?

01:53:36.935 --> 01:53:40.960
Sure they will. Emmett, we need to talk.

01:53:50.782 --> 01:53:54.352
- I'm leaving tomorrow morning.
- Why?

01:53:55.912 --> 01:54:00.392
Were you on Main Street today,
when those men came into town?

01:54:03.587 --> 01:54:06.110
I hate to be the one to tell you this...

01:54:09.343 --> 01:54:10.660
but I'm not Luke.

01:54:11.928 --> 01:54:15.202
- Yeah, I knew that.
- You did?

01:54:15.349 --> 01:54:18.544
Since the welcome-home dance,
when you played the piano.

01:54:19.603 --> 01:54:22.081
- You're kidding!
- Let me tell you...

01:54:22.189 --> 01:54:25.589
Luke played the classics
like nobody's business...

01:54:25.692 --> 01:54:29.717
but when it come to getting jazz,
he was a lost boy.

01:54:30.447 --> 01:54:35.644
When I heard that fine roadhouse boogie,
I knew you wasn't Luke.

01:54:35.869 --> 01:54:37.604
You didn't say anything?

01:54:37.704 --> 01:54:40.648
Nobody else had to know.

01:54:40.749 --> 01:54:44.695
This town needed you to be Luke,
so you were Luke.

01:54:46.254 --> 01:54:48.197
But I'm not Luke anymore.

01:54:50.759 --> 01:54:55.789
- That's why I'm going back to L.A.
- For how long?

01:54:55.889 --> 01:55:00.369
- For good.
- But who's gonna run The Majestic?

01:55:02.479 --> 01:55:03.796
You are.

01:55:04.147 --> 01:55:06.875
- Me?
- You and Irene.

01:55:10.362 --> 01:55:12.806
I don't know about that.

01:55:16.451 --> 01:55:20.806
Harry would have wanted you to keep
this place going. You'll need those.

01:56:25.312 --> 01:56:27.665
I didn't know you were here.

01:56:28.773 --> 01:56:30.170
I was just...

01:56:32.194 --> 01:56:34.012
saying goodbye.

01:56:44.748 --> 01:56:48.227
Adele, I'm sorry the way
things turned out.

01:56:48.335 --> 01:56:52.235
I never meant to hurt anyone,
least of all you.

01:56:52.339 --> 01:56:55.864
People get hurt sometimes,
we can't always help it.

01:56:55.967 --> 01:56:58.161
It's just the way things are.

01:57:01.389 --> 01:57:04.501
So are you really a Communist?

01:57:05.810 --> 01:57:08.333
No, I'm really not.

01:57:08.438 --> 01:57:13.635
I didn't think so. Only a capitalist
could get The Majestic up and running.

01:57:13.735 --> 01:57:16.463
Great endorsement.
Can I call you as a witness?

01:57:17.030 --> 01:57:20.509
- Well, if it helps.
- Thanks.

01:57:22.577 --> 01:57:27.808
- So, what will you tell the Committee?
- Tell them what they want to hear:

01:57:28.250 --> 01:57:30.978
"Sorry, I won't do it again,
blah, blah."

01:57:31.086 --> 01:57:33.029
You're not serious.

01:57:33.129 --> 01:57:35.323
- What's wrong with it?
- Everything.

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:38.159
Be more specific.

01:57:38.260 --> 01:57:43.457
Aside from the fact that this is a free
country, and you can be a Communist...

01:57:43.557 --> 01:57:48.503
if you want to be, leaving that aside,
if you're accused falsely...

01:57:48.603 --> 01:57:54.130
you have a duty as well as a right
to stand up and suggest they drop dead.

01:57:54.526 --> 01:57:56.924
Emile Zola,
you feel strongly about this.

01:57:57.028 --> 01:57:58.380
Damn right!

01:57:58.989 --> 01:58:03.970
It doesn't make it any less rigged.
It's called a witch-hunt.

01:58:04.077 --> 01:58:07.355
And there's burden of proof,
innocence before guilt.

01:58:07.455 --> 01:58:11.685
In law school, but the rest of us
live in the real world.

01:58:11.793 --> 01:58:14.442
I mess with these guys, I go to jail.

01:58:14.546 --> 01:58:16.899
All the more reason to fight them.

01:58:17.257 --> 01:58:21.908
Like Luke would have done?
Go ahead, say it.

01:58:22.012 --> 01:58:27.250
- Yes, like Luke would have done.
- God, here it comes.

01:58:27.350 --> 01:58:32.506
Tell me again what a great guy Luke was.
I haven't heard that enough!

01:58:32.606 --> 01:58:36.009
- He would have stood up.
- Well, he's not here...

01:58:36.109 --> 01:58:39.387
to vouch for that.
We have to take your word!

01:58:39.487 --> 01:58:43.016
Everybody's memory of Luke
is a little rose-colored.

01:58:43.116 --> 01:58:45.894
Besides, I'm not Luke.

01:58:45.994 --> 01:58:49.724
While he was liberating Europe,
I was running the PX.

01:58:49.831 --> 01:58:53.151
He couldn't wait to save the world!
I was happy not to go!

01:58:53.251 --> 01:58:55.987
- Why?
- I didn't want to end up like him.

01:58:56.087 --> 01:59:00.363
I wanted to survive!
You stand up for a cause...

01:59:00.467 --> 01:59:04.663
you get mowed down. Look. Look!

01:59:05.972 --> 01:59:07.540
That's the real world.

01:59:11.186 --> 01:59:16.258
I want my goddamn life back.
Is that so hard to understand?

01:59:17.817 --> 01:59:19.134
Wow.

01:59:20.737 --> 01:59:24.057
I really did have you two confused.

01:59:42.258 --> 01:59:48.498
Last call, California West to L.A.
and all points south.

01:59:48.598 --> 01:59:51.076
Where the hell have you been?

01:59:52.727 --> 01:59:56.047
- Walking.
- Walking? For two hours?

01:59:56.189 --> 01:59:59.543
Don't do this to me, kid.
I got a nerve condition.

02:00:01.861 --> 02:00:04.464
Come on. Come on.

02:00:21.548 --> 02:00:23.283
How is she?

02:00:23.383 --> 02:00:29.707
She came back from the cemetery
a bit upset. But she'll be fine.

02:00:30.640 --> 02:00:35.462
She wanted you to have this.

02:00:37.981 --> 02:00:43.087
- What is it?
- I didn't think to ask.

02:00:49.033 --> 02:00:52.057
All aboard!

02:01:36.581 --> 02:01:40.481
Dearest Adele: I have a feeling
we'll be moving out soon...

02:01:40.627 --> 02:01:44.280
so I may not get a chance
to write for some time.

02:01:44.380 --> 02:01:46.908
Thank you for all your letters.

02:01:47.008 --> 02:01:50.612
I can't tell you how much they
cheer me and make me think of home.

02:01:51.221 --> 02:01:52.580
I'm not trying to frighten you.

02:01:52.680 --> 02:01:57.585
I'm going into this having accepted
that I may not be back.

02:01:57.685 --> 02:02:02.674
If that should happen, promise
you will not mourn my passing.

02:02:02.774 --> 02:02:08.176
Move on, live your life to the fullest
in order to give mine meaning...

02:02:08.279 --> 02:02:11.808
and to honor the cause
we're fighting to achieve.

02:02:11.908 --> 02:02:17.939
When bullies rise up, we have
to beat them down, whatever the cost.

02:02:18.039 --> 02:02:23.396
That's a simple idea, I suppose,
but one worth giving everything for.

02:02:24.170 --> 02:02:28.408
The only thought that saddens me,
aside from failing at our task...

02:02:28.508 --> 02:02:31.161
is the thought of never seeing you.

02:02:31.261 --> 02:02:34.914
Not holding you,
not seeing our children grow...

02:02:35.014 --> 02:02:38.209
not spending the passing years with you.

02:02:38.309 --> 02:02:43.461
If I should not come back,
know that I will never truly leave you.

02:02:44.148 --> 02:02:47.878
Should you be walking years from now
on a spring day...

02:02:47.986 --> 02:02:51.010
and feel a warm breeze
graze your cheek...

02:02:51.114 --> 02:02:55.094
that warm breeze will be me,
giving you a kiss.

02:02:55.368 --> 02:02:58.221
Remember, finally, above all...

02:02:58.329 --> 02:03:00.431
that I love you.

02:03:00.623 --> 02:03:02.691
Luke.

02:03:19.517 --> 02:03:21.790
Mr. Appleton?

02:03:49.380 --> 02:03:50.823
Are you a Communist?

02:03:53.384 --> 02:03:55.703
Anything you want to say?

02:04:03.603 --> 02:04:04.955
Is it true you're a Communist?

02:04:28.753 --> 02:04:31.732
The Committee will come to order.

02:04:33.758 --> 02:04:37.408
We'll have order in the chamber!

02:04:40.598 --> 02:04:43.918
Let me begin by saying
we have a full agenda.

02:04:44.185 --> 02:04:49.917
I admonish those here to view
testimony today to keep order...

02:04:50.024 --> 02:04:53.219
or this chamber will be cleared.

02:04:55.613 --> 02:05:00.264
The witness will please stand
and raise his right hand.

02:05:04.288 --> 02:05:07.984
Do you swear the testimony
you're about to give...

02:05:08.084 --> 02:05:13.486
will be the truth, the whole truth
and nothing but the truth?

02:05:13.589 --> 02:05:15.862
- I do.
- Be seated.

02:05:17.510 --> 02:05:20.204
State your full name and residence.

02:05:20.722 --> 02:05:23.496
Peter Appleton, Hollywood, California.

02:05:23.641 --> 02:05:28.212
I'm informed you have a prepared
statement you'd like to read.

02:05:28.312 --> 02:05:30.255
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Chairman...

02:05:30.356 --> 02:05:34.757
before he reads his statement,
I'd like to ask a few questions.

02:05:34.861 --> 02:05:36.463
Just to clear the air.

02:05:38.031 --> 02:05:43.058
Americans deserve to know the extent
of the Communist conspiracy...

02:05:43.161 --> 02:05:45.684
that threatens our way of life.

02:05:45.788 --> 02:05:50.109
We were told the witness would
be allowed to read a statement.

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:54.072
So he will, but he'll answer
a few questions first.

02:05:54.172 --> 02:05:58.027
Mr. Appleton, you mentioned
your home is Hollywood.

02:05:58.176 --> 02:06:03.453
But for the last several months you
made your home in the town of Lawson?

02:06:03.890 --> 02:06:05.663
Yes, that's true.

02:06:06.184 --> 02:06:09.254
Have you ever met
an Albert Lucas Trimble?

02:06:11.773 --> 02:06:13.420
No, sir.

02:06:13.524 --> 02:06:16.886
That's not possible.
Luke Trimble is dead.

02:06:16.986 --> 02:06:22.684
That didn't prevent you from
masquerading as Luke while in Lawson.

02:06:26.996 --> 02:06:28.973
Order!

02:06:29.082 --> 02:06:30.934
I wasn't masquerading.

02:06:31.042 --> 02:06:34.772
I was mistaken for Luke.
There was an accident.

02:06:34.879 --> 02:06:40.326
I'm sure anyone who reads the paper
is familiar with your accident.

02:06:40.426 --> 02:06:45.748
An accident which came hard upon
being named by this Committee.

02:06:45.848 --> 02:06:52.296
What I find hard to understand is why
you were in such a hurry to leave L.A.

02:06:52.396 --> 02:06:55.670
One might view that
as a flight from authority.

02:06:55.858 --> 02:06:57.710
I wasn't fleeing, sir.

02:06:57.819 --> 02:07:02.598
I simply went for a drive and had
an accident that affected my memory.

02:07:07.161 --> 02:07:08.934
Order!

02:07:09.163 --> 02:07:11.982
What is the state of your memory now?

02:07:12.291 --> 02:07:14.944
- My memory is fine.
- I'm glad to hear that.

02:07:15.044 --> 02:07:17.897
You might recall the item before you.

02:07:18.005 --> 02:07:23.111
It's the attendance roster
for the Bread Instead of Bullets Club...

02:07:23.219 --> 02:07:25.822
dated October 3rd, 1945.

02:07:26.389 --> 02:07:31.461
Referring to line 37, does your name
and signature appear there?

02:07:31.561 --> 02:07:33.796
- It does.
- Mr. Appleton...

02:07:33.896 --> 02:07:36.749
tell us about
the Bread Instead of Bullets Club.

02:07:37.650 --> 02:07:42.013
If the Committee will note line 36
of the document.

02:07:42.113 --> 02:07:48.311
- Thirty-six? "Lucille Angstrom"?
- I was courting Miss Angstrom.

02:07:48.411 --> 02:07:52.186
I attended the meeting
only to be with her.

02:07:52.582 --> 02:07:56.437
Are you asking us to believe
you attended a meeting...

02:07:56.544 --> 02:08:00.694
of a Communist organization
because of a girl?

02:08:01.841 --> 02:08:02.988
Yes, sir.

02:08:03.217 --> 02:08:08.331
Even someone like yourself
must be familiar with the concept.

02:08:15.271 --> 02:08:20.548
- Please confine your answers.
- I'm sorry.

02:08:20.651 --> 02:08:24.972
I'm having trouble reconciling
your testimony here.

02:08:25.072 --> 02:08:30.099
You're prepared to purge yourself
of Communist ties.

02:08:30.244 --> 02:08:34.394
Yet when questioned,
you claim not to have gone as a member.

02:08:34.498 --> 02:08:37.898
- I didn't.
- Then what did you attend as?

02:08:39.253 --> 02:08:41.105
I'm hesitant to say.

02:08:41.297 --> 02:08:45.402
You agreed to be forthcoming.
I insist you do so.

02:08:47.470 --> 02:08:51.370
Well, I went as...

02:08:53.100 --> 02:08:55.703
a horny young man.

02:09:01.108 --> 02:09:04.178
Order in the chamber!

02:09:05.821 --> 02:09:07.093
Order!

02:09:07.490 --> 02:09:10.719
He doesn't want to spar with these boys.

02:09:10.826 --> 02:09:13.520
- They'll eat him alive.
- Yes, they will.

02:09:13.621 --> 02:09:14.768
Good.

02:09:15.665 --> 02:09:20.191
This is a legally constituted Committee.
Believe me, you do not want to incur our wrath!

02:09:20.336 --> 02:09:22.530
What is the purpose of this?

02:09:22.630 --> 02:09:26.075
Mr. Appleton came here
to cooperate fully with you.

02:09:26.175 --> 02:09:29.119
Yet he's treated as a hostile witness.

02:09:29.220 --> 02:09:34.542
Point taken. Let's cut to the chase
and have him read his statement.

02:09:34.642 --> 02:09:39.748
If he's not pleading the 5th,
I do have further questions.

02:09:39.855 --> 02:09:43.718
Elvin. Let's not open this any further.

02:09:43.818 --> 02:09:48.048
I want this little turd to read
his statement and get out of here.

02:09:49.407 --> 02:09:53.011
The Committee sees no
cause for further questions.

02:09:53.119 --> 02:09:56.894
Mr. Appleton may proceed
with his statement.

02:10:15.558 --> 02:10:17.911
"I, Peter Appleton...

02:10:19.395 --> 02:10:22.214
by way of purging myself...

02:10:23.816 --> 02:10:26.419
of my indiscretions..."

02:10:28.863 --> 02:10:30.965
Mr. Appleton?

02:10:31.073 --> 02:10:33.596
I'm sorry, Mr. Chairman.

02:10:36.746 --> 02:10:38.439
I think I need some water.

02:10:38.789 --> 02:10:40.436
Go ahead, son.

02:11:08.986 --> 02:11:10.508
I can't do this.

02:11:10.613 --> 02:11:12.306
I'll make this simple.

02:11:12.406 --> 02:11:16.636
You read that statement,
or go straight to jail for contempt.

02:11:17.203 --> 02:11:21.979
- Jail?
- Jail. Just read the damn statement.

02:11:31.717 --> 02:11:35.287
"I, Peter Appleton..."

02:11:39.642 --> 02:11:44.873
Mr. Appleton, the Committee's patience
is wearing thin.

02:11:44.980 --> 02:11:47.959
I understand that, Mr. Chairman.

02:11:49.318 --> 02:11:51.591
I'm sorry.

02:12:02.832 --> 02:12:04.684
I'm sorry.

02:12:05.000 --> 02:12:10.857
It occurs to me there's a bigger issue
than whether or not I'm a Communist.

02:12:10.965 --> 02:12:14.410
Bigger issue? There is no bigger issue.

02:12:14.552 --> 02:12:17.826
Actually, not to be contrary,
I think there is.

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.421
Gosh, I don't quite know what to say.

02:12:31.819 --> 02:12:33.466
Fact is, I...

02:12:34.655 --> 02:12:38.430
I've never been a man
of great conviction.

02:12:39.535 --> 02:12:42.434
I never saw the percentage in it.

02:12:42.830 --> 02:12:45.103
And quite frankly...

02:12:45.207 --> 02:12:47.810
I suppose...

02:12:48.711 --> 02:12:51.155
I lacked the courage.

02:12:52.006 --> 02:12:54.985
See, I'm not like Luke Trimble.

02:12:55.092 --> 02:12:58.196
He had the market cornered
on those things.

02:12:58.345 --> 02:13:03.201
I never met the guy,
but I feel like I've gotten to know him.

02:13:03.309 --> 02:13:07.004
The thing is, I can't help wondering
what he'd say...

02:13:08.272 --> 02:13:11.421
if he were standing here right now.

02:13:13.861 --> 02:13:16.680
I think he'd probably tell you...

02:13:16.864 --> 02:13:20.685
the America represented in this room...

02:13:21.744 --> 02:13:25.348
is not the America he died defending.

02:13:26.665 --> 02:13:28.813
I think he'd say your
America is bitter...

02:13:30.169 --> 02:13:32.363
and cruel and small.

02:13:32.922 --> 02:13:34.365
Come to order!

02:13:34.465 --> 02:13:38.866
I know his America was big.
Bigger than you can imagine!

02:13:39.011 --> 02:13:40.454
With a wide-open heart!

02:13:41.972 --> 02:13:44.495
Where every person has a voice!

02:13:44.600 --> 02:13:46.998
Even if you don't like what they say...

02:13:47.102 --> 02:13:49.671
Enough! You are out of order!

02:13:49.772 --> 02:13:53.217
If he were here,
I wonder how you'd respond...

02:13:53.317 --> 02:13:58.048
if you could explain to him
what happened to his America.

02:13:58.155 --> 02:14:01.384
You are skating on the edge of contempt!

02:14:01.492 --> 02:14:05.396
That's the first thing
I've heard today that I agree with!

02:14:07.498 --> 02:14:11.978
My client is clearly under
an enormous strain as a result...

02:14:12.086 --> 02:14:16.862
of the questioning of Mr. Clyde.
He's not responsible for his comments.

02:14:16.966 --> 02:14:20.411
- We wish to invoke the 5th Amendment.
- No, we don't.

02:14:20.511 --> 02:14:23.455
- We do.
- No, we don't, so knock it off!

02:14:25.474 --> 02:14:30.956
Shut up and let me get through this.
The 5th Amendment is off the table.

02:14:31.605 --> 02:14:35.084
But there is another Amendment
I'd like to invoke.

02:14:36.485 --> 02:14:40.931
I wonder if anyone here
is familiar with it.

02:14:41.031 --> 02:14:46.388
"Congress shall make no law respecting
an establishment of religion."

02:14:46.495 --> 02:14:48.097
You're out of order!

02:14:48.205 --> 02:14:50.148
"Shall make no law...

02:14:50.249 --> 02:14:54.479
- ...respecting..."
- My chamber will come to order!

02:14:54.587 --> 02:14:57.281
"An establishment of religion...

02:14:57.381 --> 02:14:59.859
or prohibiting free exercise thereof...

02:14:59.967 --> 02:15:03.617
or abridging freedom of speech,
or of the press...

02:15:03.721 --> 02:15:09.168
or of the right to petition
for a redress of grievances."

02:15:09.268 --> 02:15:12.338
Do not presume to lecture
this Committee!

02:15:12.438 --> 02:15:16.926
The First Amendment. It's what
we're about, if we'd live up to it.

02:15:17.026 --> 02:15:19.094
Let him talk. He's hanging himself.

02:15:19.194 --> 02:15:23.265
It's the most important part of the
contract every citizen has here.

02:15:23.365 --> 02:15:27.470
Even though the Constitution
and the Bill of Rights...

02:15:27.578 --> 02:15:31.899
are just pieces of paper
with signatures on them...

02:15:31.999 --> 02:15:37.196
they're the only contracts we have
that are definitely not subject...

02:15:37.296 --> 02:15:38.989
to renegotiation.

02:15:39.298 --> 02:15:42.368
- Not by you, Mr. Chairman.
- Mr. Appleton!

02:15:42.468 --> 02:15:44.995
- Not by you, Mr. Clyde.
- Stand down!

02:15:45.095 --> 02:15:48.165
Not by anyone, ever.

02:15:48.265 --> 02:15:51.039
Too many people have paid in blood.

02:15:51.143 --> 02:15:54.213
Enough, sir! You are out of order!

02:15:59.193 --> 02:16:01.091
People like Luke Trimble...

02:16:04.865 --> 02:16:07.593
and all the sons of Lawson, California.

02:16:15.542 --> 02:16:17.770
Damn right.

02:16:17.920 --> 02:16:20.864
And they deserve better than this.

02:16:21.215 --> 02:16:23.693
All you boys do.

02:16:26.387 --> 02:16:30.749
I will have order
or I will clear this chamber!

02:16:30.849 --> 02:16:33.952
When you get right down to it, fellas...

02:16:36.855 --> 02:16:39.879
that's all I have to say to you.

02:16:46.656 --> 02:16:48.142
You are not excused!

02:16:51.537 --> 02:16:55.733
The witness will resume his seat!
You are not excused!

02:16:56.458 --> 02:16:58.401
You will resume your seat!

02:16:58.502 --> 02:16:59.898
You...

02:17:51.847 --> 02:17:53.244
Sir?

02:18:18.582 --> 02:18:21.401
I'm going to the studio.
Where can I drop you?

02:18:21.959 --> 02:18:23.486
Home.

02:18:23.587 --> 02:18:26.656
- Gotta pack.
- Pack?

02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:30.490
I'm going to prison.
I'll need a toothbrush.

02:18:30.593 --> 02:18:32.617
Why do you think you're going to prison?

02:18:32.721 --> 02:18:36.791
You saw it. I just told them
to screw themselves.

02:18:36.892 --> 02:18:38.459
That's one way to see it.

02:18:38.559 --> 02:18:41.163
- What other way is there?
- Try this one.

02:18:41.939 --> 02:18:46.093
They made a hero out of you.
Think they'll promote you to martyr?

02:18:46.192 --> 02:18:51.093
No, I don't think so.
This is about them saving face.

02:18:51.198 --> 02:18:54.142
If you're gonna be a hero,
you'll be theirs.

02:18:54.243 --> 02:18:58.147
While you talked to reporters,
a flack came up talking deal.

02:18:58.246 --> 02:19:01.691
- What kind of a deal?
- You know, deal.

02:19:01.791 --> 02:19:06.897
They thrive on names.
With a witness like you, any name will do.

02:19:07.004 --> 02:19:08.991
I didn't give them any names.

02:19:09.091 --> 02:19:11.114
Suddenly Lucille Angstrom isn't a name?

02:19:12.886 --> 02:19:18.243
I didn't give them her name. It was
right in front of them. They had it.

02:19:18.517 --> 02:19:22.041
- That's not how they see it.
- Does it matter?

02:19:22.145 --> 02:19:26.716
She's just a girl I knew in college,
not even in show business.

02:19:27.692 --> 02:19:31.468
- Is she?
- She's Lucille Hirschfield now...

02:19:31.572 --> 02:19:35.017
and she happens to be a producer
for Studio One on CBS.

02:19:40.289 --> 02:19:43.313
- Oh, my God!
- Which puts you in the clear.

02:19:43.416 --> 02:19:47.522
At this very moment, Chairman Doyle
is in front of the press...

02:19:47.629 --> 02:19:50.278
thanking you for purging yourself.

02:19:50.382 --> 02:19:55.078
- For what? Ruining this woman's life?
- You're not ruining anyone's life.

02:19:55.178 --> 02:20:00.034
The Committee already knew about her.
She was named six months ago.

02:20:00.142 --> 02:20:01.710
Hell...

02:20:01.810 --> 02:20:03.583
who do you think named you?

02:20:05.772 --> 02:20:09.376
- She named me?
- That's water under the bridge.

02:20:09.484 --> 02:20:13.088
The point is, the studio
is picking up your contract.

02:20:13.196 --> 02:20:15.557
Your movie is back in production.

02:20:15.657 --> 02:20:18.055
Congratulations, Pete.

02:20:18.160 --> 02:20:20.103
You got your life back.

02:20:24.416 --> 02:20:28.362
What about the end of the movie?
It's not loaded enough.

02:20:28.462 --> 02:20:31.990
It doesn't feel like he went
through enough anguish.

02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:35.410
Guy makes a speech...

02:20:35.510 --> 02:20:38.204
how do we know
how noble he is unless he suffers?

02:20:38.305 --> 02:20:42.581
How about an injury? He breaks
his arm, but what if it's worse?

02:20:42.684 --> 02:20:46.914
- We could break his leg.
- That's a bad showbiz joke.

02:20:47.022 --> 02:20:49.216
What if he's in an iron lung?

02:20:49.316 --> 02:20:53.887
He should go to the rally in
an iron lung? They roll him up?

02:20:53.987 --> 02:20:57.432
Hold on. I think I got a "what if."

02:20:57.532 --> 02:21:00.269
What if the main character...?
What's his name?

02:21:00.369 --> 02:21:02.688
- Heywood.
- Terrible. Change it.

02:21:02.788 --> 02:21:07.894
What if, during the cave-in,
he gets hit on the head and goes blind?

02:21:08.001 --> 02:21:12.447
That way, during the rally,
his faithful dog who saved him...

02:21:12.547 --> 02:21:17.077
- leads him there to give the speech.
- Oh, my God, I'm choked up.

02:21:17.177 --> 02:21:21.498
- I got tears. It's great.
- Better than great. It sings.

02:21:21.598 --> 02:21:24.793
Not a dry eye in the house.

02:21:24.893 --> 02:21:28.497
Let's ask the writer.
What do you think, Pete?

02:21:30.107 --> 02:21:32.630
Wow, that's just...

02:21:37.406 --> 02:21:40.601
Just about the dumbest thing
I've ever heard.

02:21:44.413 --> 02:21:46.231
Hey.

02:21:47.165 --> 02:21:49.438
I got a "what if."

02:22:05.100 --> 02:22:09.421
- May I help you, sir?
- I'd like to send a telegram, please.

02:22:09.521 --> 02:22:11.840
Yes, sir, go ahead.

02:22:12.357 --> 02:22:15.006
Dear Adele, stop.

02:22:16.778 --> 02:22:21.850
Am coming back to Lawson
to return what I borrowed, stop.

02:22:25.120 --> 02:22:30.147
Would very much like
to ask you a question, stop.

02:22:31.418 --> 02:22:36.945
If you're not on the platform
when I arrive, I will understand, stop.

02:22:38.133 --> 02:22:43.080
I will leave your book and Luke's medal
with the stationmaster...

02:22:43.221 --> 02:22:48.043
get back on the train
and just keep going...

02:22:48.643 --> 02:22:50.620
stop.

02:23:49.830 --> 02:23:51.978
Let me get that for you.

02:23:52.874 --> 02:23:54.817
Welcome back!

02:24:10.308 --> 02:24:12.753
Welcome home. I'm so happy to see you.

02:24:12.853 --> 02:24:17.003
I knew you couldn't stay away.
I knew it all along.

02:24:21.486 --> 02:24:23.805
Look at you!

02:24:35.876 --> 02:24:37.603
Welcome home.

02:24:39.462 --> 02:24:41.530
You too.

02:24:49.764 --> 02:24:52.162
Welcome back again.

02:25:16.374 --> 02:25:18.943
So, what was your question?

02:25:22.088 --> 02:25:24.361
I forget.

02:26:02.045 --> 02:26:05.649
That's yours. Thank you.

02:26:05.757 --> 02:26:08.986
Have a good night. Enjoy the show.

02:26:14.516 --> 02:26:16.618
Two adults?
