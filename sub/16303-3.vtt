about some threeway.

there was three girls and one-

to hear everything!

01:20.881 --> 01:22.516
- Everything that's pertinent.

01:22.516 --> 01:24.652
- Pertinent to what?!

01:24.652 --> 01:26.854
- To whatever the hell it is
you did in that lab to

01:26.854 --> 01:28.822
create that black fucking hole!

01:28.822 --> 01:29.923
- This is what we did
in the lab!

01:29.923 --> 01:31.225
- Fourways?

01:31.225 --> 01:33.161
- No.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.728
Lucid dreaming.

Do you guys realize that
you spend 220,000 hours

01:41.335 --> 01:44.305
out of your life asleep?

01:44.305 --> 01:46.840

Completely unconscious.

You try to make sense of the
cold scary world,

out a little bit of happiness.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.824
You never even know.

That with just a
few simple tricks.

02:39.493 --> 02:40.728
What'd you do with my dick?

02:40.728 --> 02:41.962
- Uh... I don't know.

02:41.962 --> 02:44.565
I can't seem to find
it in the simulation.

02:44.565 --> 02:46.867

02:46.867 --> 02:48.135

at the movie theater.

02:49.470 --> 02:50.238
What do you mean?

02:50.238 --> 02:51.772

Yeah, I see what I did there.

You don't need those.

03:24.905 --> 03:25.939
You know about the business.

Couple of nights back, around
four in the a.m., I'm in bed.

And I'm with my wife,

Who, bless her heart,
has a deviated septum,

05:08.876 --> 05:11.545

sound like...

complete dream land.

05:22.756 --> 05:27.761

upright by a phone call.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.597
Building-wide power surges.

05:29.597 --> 05:30.598
Random blackouts.

05:30.598 --> 05:32.065
All caused by...

05:33.801 --> 05:35.202
Your lab.

05:35.202 --> 05:38.706
- Do you mean the building with
his father's name on it?

05:39.540 --> 05:41.174
- You're on full scholarship,
is that correct?

05:41.174 --> 05:43.043
- Actually, it's a
research grant.

05:43.043 --> 05:46.547
- And you'd like to keep that
research grant.

05:46.547 --> 05:49.082
Because what happens oftentimes
with research grants...

05:49.082 --> 05:50.217
They just disappear.

05:50.217 --> 05:52.986
They just dissipate
like the wisps-

05:52.986 --> 05:54.021
- Okay. What do you want?

05:54.021 --> 05:57.425
- I want $18,730.

05:57.425 --> 05:59.960
Because that's what it cost me
to replace the transformers

05:59.960 --> 06:01.962

06:01.962 --> 06:04.732

06:15.443 --> 06:16.444
- Yeah, puppies.

06:16.444 --> 06:17.711
- Brain waves.

06:17.711 --> 06:20.848
- You know, there's an
old academic saying...

shit, it's probably

06:22.716 --> 06:25.853

06:28.889 --> 06:29.790

06:29.790 --> 06:30.658
- Then I need that
$20,000.

06:30.658 --> 06:32.192

06:32.192 --> 06:33.561

Do not call...

06:38.231 --> 06:39.099

It's, uh...

06:40.067 --> 06:41.201
Sorry. I'm sorry.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.570
It's just...

06:42.570 --> 06:44.071
There's only one thing that
my dad hates more than

06:44.071 --> 06:47.074
my failures, and that is hearing
about my failures secondhand,

06:47.074 --> 06:48.509
so uh...

06:48.509 --> 06:49.777
Don't worry about it.

06:49.777 --> 06:51.044
I'll get you the money.

06:51.044 --> 06:52.746
Okay?

06:53.013 --> 06:55.483
- That's be great.

06:55.483 --> 06:56.717
You've got one week.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.018
You get me that money.

up with $20,000?

calling your father?

07:18.238 --> 07:19.006
- Hell no.

07:19.006 --> 07:19.873
No way.

07:19.873 --> 07:21.208
- What about your allowance?

07:21.208 --> 07:22.442
- It was a lump sum, we blew
through it with the lab.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.211
- And the thousand dollar
dinners you've been

07:24.211 --> 07:25.579
taking Hannah on?

07:25.579 --> 07:27.715
- I know and she mostly just
ordered salads and water.

I'm gonna be blunt with you.

07:30.618 --> 07:32.085
You're becoming an impediment
to my research.

07:32.085 --> 07:33.186
- Oh, I'm an impediment?

07:33.186 --> 07:34.454
You're an impediment.

07:34.454 --> 07:36.957
- I don't think you know what
impediment means.

07:36.957 --> 07:38.025
- Does it mean asshole?

07:38.025 --> 07:38.826
Because that's
what you're being.

07:38.826 --> 07:39.560
I funded your research.

07:39.560 --> 07:40.694
- Your father funded it.

07:40.694 --> 07:42.329
- Whatever; I'll come up
with something.

07:42.329 --> 07:43.597
- You better.

07:43.597 --> 07:45.999
Because I swear to God,
if I lose my grant,

07:45.999 --> 07:48.869
I'm naming you in
my suicide note.

07:48.869 --> 07:50.771
- God, you are dark sometimes.

07:54.842 --> 07:56.143

in that adorable little

07:57.310 --> 07:59.146

07:59.146 --> 08:00.781
Probably a bunch of
kibble, but...

08:00.781 --> 08:02.082
we'll give it a try.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.317
Hey, guys!

08:04.317 --> 08:05.152
Look at Mr. Peanuts.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.187
- Shut the hell up, Larry.

08:07.187 --> 08:08.622
Sam has something he
needs to tell you.

08:08.622 --> 08:09.156
- Oh.

08:09.156 --> 08:10.323
Cool.

08:10.323 --> 08:11.992
What's up, Sam?

08:11.992 --> 08:13.927
- We've gotta sell like...

08:13.927 --> 08:15.295
half the lab.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.597
- Why?

08:16.597 --> 08:17.330
Oh no.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.131

08:18.131 --> 08:18.766

fault, but...

you are a big factor.

08:24.071 --> 08:25.105
Start packing everything up.

08:25.105 --> 08:26.574
- No, no, no!

08:26.574 --> 08:29.109
Guys, we were just starting
to work together as a team!

08:29.109 --> 08:30.343
Everyone had their role.

08:30.343 --> 08:31.679
A girl came into the lab.

08:31.679 --> 08:33.046
That was kinda nice.

08:33.046 --> 08:35.048
Connor, you started making
consistent eye contact.

08:35.048 --> 08:36.750
- Sorry, Larry.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.951
The dream is dead.

08:37.951 --> 08:39.019
You loaded the gun.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.721
Sam pulled the trigger.

08:40.721 --> 08:42.289
We're selling everything.

08:42.289 --> 08:43.624
Starting with Mr. Peanuts.

08:43.624 --> 08:44.191
- Sam.

08:44.191 --> 08:45.025
No.

08:45.025 --> 08:45.726
Sam.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.326
- Not Mr. Peanuts.

08:46.326 --> 08:46.960
Come on, Connor.

08:46.960 --> 08:47.561
- Nope, nope.

08:47.561 --> 08:49.963
- Mr. Peanuts...

08:53.133 --> 08:55.368
- The hospital was very nice.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.138
But there was this Latino
woman who always seemed

08:58.138 --> 09:00.207
to fluff my pillows wrong.

09:00.207 --> 09:03.276
- I think she was Filipino,
but I'm glad you're home.

sleeping lately.

09:36.944 --> 09:38.946

09:38.946 --> 09:40.781
- It's just a lot of...

09:40.781 --> 09:42.415
life changes.

09:42.415 --> 09:44.652
Bad dreams.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.887
I'm thinking about quitting
the Masters program.

09:46.887 --> 09:47.888
- Oh no, honey.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.456
Why?

09:49.456 --> 09:52.993
- It's just so much debt with
all these student loans, and...

09:52.993 --> 09:54.194
for what?

09:54.194 --> 09:57.197
A piece of paper that says
I have a Masters?

09:57.197 --> 10:00.367
- But college is the
best time of your life.

10:00.367 --> 10:02.435
What I'd do to go back.

10:02.435 --> 10:04.004
Take exciting courses.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.338
Write fun papers.

10:05.338 --> 10:07.741
Go through another
lesbian phase.

10:07.741 --> 10:10.778
I'd pay anything to have
that experience again.

10:10.778 --> 10:12.445
- Wait.

10:12.445 --> 10:14.114
Say that again.

10:14.114 --> 10:15.949
- I want another
lesbian phase?

10:15.949 --> 10:16.784
- No, no, no.

10:16.784 --> 10:18.118
The other thing.

10:18.118 --> 10:22.022
- I'd pay anything to have
that experience again.

10:22.022 --> 10:29.997
- [music]

10:29.997 --> 10:31.231
- How much is this worth?

10:31.231 --> 10:32.833
- Oh, we could get like
50 bucks for that.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.001
- Okay.

10:34.001 --> 10:36.269
- [glass breaking]

10:36.269 --> 10:37.204
- Put it in the dollar bin.

10:37.204 --> 10:38.205
- Knock knock.

10:38.205 --> 10:38.972
- Hannah!

10:38.972 --> 10:39.673
Hey, it's good to see ya.

10:39.673 --> 10:40.307
How have you been?

10:40.307 --> 10:41.641
- Just great.

10:41.641 --> 10:42.242
Definitely not dreading
every time I go to bed.

10:42.242 --> 10:45.212
- Uh, good.

10:45.212 --> 10:46.847
- The hell's going on here?

10:46.847 --> 10:48.181
- We're having a garage sale.

10:48.181 --> 10:48.916
- What?

10:48.916 --> 10:50.117
Why?

10:50.117 --> 10:51.952
- Because your boyfriend
turns every dream into a

10:51.952 --> 10:53.386
god forsaken nightmare.

10:53.386 --> 10:54.755
- He's not my boyfriend.

10:54.755 --> 10:57.124
- Well, technically, you did
promise me one more date.

10:57.124 --> 10:58.391
- That's how you remember it.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.227
- We are out of money.

11:00.227 --> 11:02.796
And after a power surge
from the Brain Frame

11:02.796 --> 11:05.432
fried a transformer, we're stuck
in the hole 20 grand.

11:05.432 --> 11:06.800
- Only eighteen thousand seven-

11:06.800 --> 11:08.235
- I'm rounding up.

11:08.235 --> 11:12.039
- What if I said you could
keep the lab, pay your debt,

11:12.039 --> 11:14.875
and make some on the side?

11:14.875 --> 11:16.476
- So.

11:16.476 --> 11:18.511
It was your idea.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.880
- I don't want to
take sole credit.

11:19.880 --> 11:21.048
But...

11:21.048 --> 11:22.950
Yeah, it was my idea.

11:24.051 --> 11:24.952
Solely.

11:24.952 --> 11:29.156
- [chalk scratching on board]

11:32.025 --> 11:33.160
- One thousand what?

11:33.160 --> 11:34.427
- Dollars.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.897
One thousand dollars.

11:36.897 --> 11:38.298
- For what?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.869
- For people to use the
Brain Frame recreationally.

11:42.269 --> 11:43.570
For fun.

11:43.570 --> 11:45.939
For people to have experiences
that they can't

11:45.939 --> 11:48.776
have in the real world.

11:49.542 --> 11:50.944
Yes? Larry.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.112
- Are puppies involved?

11:52.112 --> 11:53.246
- I guess.

11:53.246 --> 11:55.382
If people want dreams
with puppies.

11:55.382 --> 11:56.016
- Cool.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.818
Cool, cool, cool.

11:58.218 --> 11:59.519
- What do you think?

11:59.519 --> 12:01.388
- Like all of your ideas,
I think it's fantastic.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.123
Multa bella!
[kiss smack]

12:03.123 --> 12:04.257
- Connor.

12:04.257 --> 12:04.792
- I hate it.

12:04.792 --> 12:05.492
- What?

12:05.492 --> 12:06.726
Why?

12:06.726 --> 12:09.362
- Because it goes against
everything I believe in.

12:09.362 --> 12:11.431
- Everything you believe in.

12:11.431 --> 12:14.267
Coming from the guy who
used my aunt's cancer

12:14.267 --> 12:16.003
to get me to take back
that troll.

12:16.003 --> 12:17.871
- She's kidding.

12:17.871 --> 12:19.339
- Listen.

12:19.339 --> 12:21.508
The night you guys hooked me
up to that machine may have

12:21.508 --> 12:24.812
been the most terrifying
experience of my life,

12:24.812 --> 12:26.246
and you're not forgiven.

12:26.246 --> 12:27.915
But...

12:27.915 --> 12:30.050
It was real.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.119
It was so...

12:32.119 --> 12:32.853
real.

12:32.853 --> 12:34.287
I can still feel it.

12:34.287 --> 12:39.459
Just... imagine if we could
offer people an experience

12:39.459 --> 12:43.063
that they actually wanted...

12:43.063 --> 12:44.898
We could change the world.

12:46.433 --> 12:48.068
And make a shitload of money.

12:49.136 --> 12:51.104
- I didn't create this
to make money.

12:51.104 --> 12:53.573
I created it to push the
boundaries of science.

12:53.573 --> 12:55.375
Not so we could watch you
ride the train to bone town

12:55.375 --> 12:56.844
with Casper Van Dien.

12:56.844 --> 12:59.479
- Casper Van Dien?

12:59.479 --> 13:00.981
Who else did you guys
see inside my head?

13:00.981 --> 13:02.149
- Who else would we have seen?

13:02.149 --> 13:03.250
- Well, for one, not you.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.584
- Ooo.

13:04.584 --> 13:05.485
- Look, Hannah.

13:05.485 --> 13:06.954
You're smart and you're savvy.

13:06.954 --> 13:08.355
I'll give you that.

13:08.355 --> 13:10.323
But this would never work with
my strict code of ethics.

13:10.323 --> 13:11.191
- Fine.

13:11.191 --> 13:15.328
Then, I tell Dean Samuelson.

13:15.328 --> 13:16.596
- So how's the money
gonna work?

13:16.596 --> 13:19.399
Is it gonna be like a
threeway split evenly?

13:19.399 --> 13:20.233
- What about me?

13:20.233 --> 13:21.902
- You're an intern, Larry.

13:21.902 --> 13:22.936
- Can I keep Mr. Peanuts?

13:22.936 --> 13:24.271
- Sure.

13:24.271 --> 13:25.205
- Yes.

13:25.205 --> 13:26.439
- Alright.

13:26.439 --> 13:28.608
Obviously it goes without
saying this is a secret.

13:28.608 --> 13:30.243
- Of course.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.079
- And the second something
goes wrong.

13:32.079 --> 13:34.347
- We stop it.

13:34.347 --> 13:34.882
- Alright.

13:34.882 --> 13:36.183
I'm in.

13:36.183 --> 13:37.885
- Yeah!

13:37.885 --> 13:47.594
- [chaotic stormy music]

13:50.563 --> 14:01.108
- [church bells ringing]

14:01.108 --> 14:03.510
[tape rips]

14:03.510 --> 14:04.811
[upbeat music]

14:04.811 --> 14:08.015
- Hey, would you want
to take a second, okay.

14:08.015 --> 14:09.983
- Could you just take a
second of your time to-

14:09.983 --> 14:19.159
- [music]

14:19.159 --> 14:20.393
- Hi, could you just-

14:21.161 --> 14:22.162
- You want a flier?

14:22.162 --> 14:23.596
OK, you get a flier.

14:23.596 --> 14:28.201
- [laughter]

14:28.201 --> 14:30.503
- Hey, you look like someone who
could use some cheering up.

14:30.503 --> 14:33.040
- I'm not going to your
Bible study, bitch.

14:33.040 --> 14:33.573
- Excuse me!

14:33.573 --> 14:35.642
Fellas!

14:35.642 --> 14:37.044
- Do you dare to dream?

14:37.044 --> 14:37.610
Ow!

14:37.610 --> 14:38.545
- Ahem!

14:38.545 --> 14:40.047
Hey.

14:40.047 --> 14:42.382
How would you like to have the
time of your life all while

14:42.382 --> 14:45.518
being unconscious in my lab?

14:46.719 --> 14:48.088
- You're gonna love this.

14:48.255 --> 14:49.356
Tell your friends!

14:49.356 --> 14:50.490
- You have to pay me.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.292
Of course, it's a
business proposition.

14:52.292 --> 14:53.293
- Oh yeah. Right.

14:53.293 --> 14:54.161
Okay, fuck you.

14:54.161 --> 14:55.228
- Oh! Come on!

14:55.228 --> 14:56.229
- Fucking creep.

14:56.229 --> 14:57.730
- Oh! Really?!

14:57.730 --> 14:58.932
God!

15:00.067 --> 15:01.668
- [car alarm]

15:01.668 --> 15:05.105
[music]

15:05.105 --> 15:07.340
- Have you no respect for
science?!

15:07.340 --> 15:08.475
- [panicked yelling]

15:08.475 --> 15:09.977
- [car alarm]

15:09.977 --> 15:11.311
- Hey, hey, hey!

15:11.311 --> 15:15.615
- [car alarm]

15:15.615 --> 15:16.849
- Damn it!

15:16.849 --> 15:18.285
- Well, that couldn't
have gone any worse.

15:18.285 --> 15:20.553
- Hey, at least Larry passed
out all the fliers, right?

15:20.553 --> 15:21.388
- Yeah.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.189
All of them.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.024
Every last one of them.

15:24.024 --> 15:26.226
- So I guess we just wait?

15:26.759 --> 15:27.760
- [door opening]

15:27.760 --> 15:31.631
- What in the living fuck
is this?!

15:35.468 --> 15:37.104
- You guys stole
my idea again!

15:37.104 --> 15:38.305
- What?

15:38.305 --> 15:39.039
- Oh, you're all just
gonna pretend like

15:39.039 --> 15:39.639
you don't remember.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.340
- Remember what?

15:40.340 --> 15:40.974
- The other night?

15:40.974 --> 15:43.243
In Hannah's head?

15:43.243 --> 15:43.876
- When you acted like a doctor
and tried to make

15:43.876 --> 15:45.112
a move on me?

15:45.112 --> 15:46.313
- I was kidding.

15:46.313 --> 15:47.514
But for the record,
she was all for it.

15:47.514 --> 15:48.281
- No I wasn't.

15:48.281 --> 15:49.282
- Not talking about that.

15:49.282 --> 15:49.916
I'm talking about
in the alley.

15:49.916 --> 15:51.351
When I said...

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
- Guys, I know this is very
scary, but once it's over,

15:53.620 --> 15:56.056
I think we should make
a business out of it.

15:56.056 --> 15:58.158
- (speaking Spanish)

15:58.158 --> 15:59.326
- (speaking Spanish)

15:59.326 --> 16:01.128
- Okay, that definitely
didn't happen.

16:01.128 --> 16:02.562
- It doesn't matter.

16:02.562 --> 16:04.464
The point is, you guys are
doing this completely wrong.

16:04.464 --> 16:06.333
- Care to enlighten us,
Berkman?

16:06.333 --> 16:07.200
- I would love to.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.701
First of all, who made this?

16:08.701 --> 16:09.602
- Well, that'd be me.

16:09.602 --> 16:10.703
- Okay.

16:10.703 --> 16:12.039
I just got a couple
notes for you.

16:12.039 --> 16:14.341
Why don't you go back to the
1800s, say hello to your

16:14.341 --> 16:17.077
great grandfather, and
bite his dick off.

16:17.077 --> 16:20.047
Because this makes me wish that
you were never even born.

16:20.047 --> 16:23.650
I mean, "Live your
dreams for real"?

16:23.650 --> 16:25.618
This sounds like a club
where you circle jerk

16:25.618 --> 16:26.686
to motivational posters.

16:26.686 --> 16:27.820
- Okay.

16:27.820 --> 16:29.422
You try selling it.

16:29.422 --> 16:31.058
- [paper crinkling]

16:31.058 --> 16:32.225
- I already have.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.793
In fact, I've got our
first customer.

16:33.793 --> 16:35.062
- What?

16:35.062 --> 16:36.096
- You got a customer?

16:36.096 --> 16:36.829
- Yep.

16:36.829 --> 16:38.398
He's right outside.

16:38.398 --> 16:42.435
And he's willing to pay $200.

16:42.435 --> 16:44.837
- Well, we were gonna
charge a thousand.

16:44.837 --> 16:46.206
But I guess we could
bring it down.

16:46.206 --> 16:47.407
For beta testing.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.175
- Good.

16:48.175 --> 16:49.809
But!

16:49.809 --> 16:51.611
I want credit.

16:51.611 --> 16:52.812
- Yeah. Why not?

16:52.812 --> 16:53.646
Sure.

16:53.646 --> 16:55.248
It was your idea, Berkman.

16:55.248 --> 16:56.516
- It was a great idea.

16:56.516 --> 16:57.517
- Well played, Berkman.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.486
- You're very smart.

16:59.486 --> 17:00.587
- Thanks, guys.

17:00.587 --> 17:01.788
Alright.

17:01.788 --> 17:03.090
I'm gonna bring him in.

17:03.090 --> 17:04.391
And I'm gonna warn you.

17:04.391 --> 17:06.359
He is one sick puppy.

17:06.359 --> 17:07.760
- Puppy.

17:07.760 --> 17:10.230
- So no judging.

17:10.797 --> 17:12.665
- Come on in, Elijah.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.368
- [door creaking]

17:15.368 --> 17:16.703
- Hey, guys.

17:17.604 --> 17:19.606
I'm Elijah.

17:19.606 --> 17:21.441
You can call me Eli.

17:21.441 --> 17:23.176
- Hi, Eli.

17:23.176 --> 17:24.777
- Alright, why don't you
tell them the fantasy

17:24.777 --> 17:26.713
you were telling me?

17:26.713 --> 17:28.215
- I, uh...

17:28.215 --> 17:29.382
I have this girlfriend.

17:29.382 --> 17:30.783
I had this girlfriend.

17:30.783 --> 17:31.651
Who dumped me.

17:31.651 --> 17:33.420
- You want to win her back?

17:33.420 --> 17:34.887
- No, she's long gone.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.190
Lives in Scottsdale.

17:37.190 --> 17:40.360
But, Berkman said he had
this idea where you guys

17:40.360 --> 17:43.396
could do something up here.

17:43.396 --> 17:47.267
And maybe I could experience
some intimacy again.

17:47.267 --> 17:48.868
- Oh, a coital fantasy.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.170
- Exactly.

17:50.170 --> 17:53.773
A fantasy where we make
love like we used to.

17:53.773 --> 17:55.375
- In front of her husband.

17:55.742 --> 17:56.776
- What's that?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.178
- Her husband, Paul.

17:58.178 --> 17:59.812
He's crazy successful.

17:59.812 --> 18:02.815
Seems like a great guy
and everything, but...

18:02.815 --> 18:04.517
- And when did the
relationship end?

18:04.517 --> 18:06.486
- In high school.

18:06.486 --> 18:09.222
Yeah, she dumped
me really good.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.724
And I just want to
experience the rush.

18:11.724 --> 18:14.261
Of being with her
one more time.

18:14.261 --> 18:18.331
In front of Paul, her family,
I mean her extended family:

18:18.331 --> 18:20.733
aunts, uncles, cousins.

18:20.733 --> 18:23.703
Our entire graduating
class of 2003.

18:24.304 --> 18:26.373
And what the hell?

18:26.373 --> 18:29.576
Former Houston Rocket center
Hakeem Olajuwon.

18:29.576 --> 18:31.144
I'm a huge fan.

18:33.813 --> 18:34.514
- Okay.

18:34.514 --> 18:35.515
Let's hook him up.

18:36.749 --> 18:38.918
- Okay, that part was
definitely not my idea.

18:38.918 --> 18:41.688
- He was... um...

18:41.688 --> 18:44.123
a unique client.

18:44.324 --> 18:45.558
- What can I say?

18:45.558 --> 18:47.760
We got a freak.

18:48.895 --> 18:51.431
- As if you have never
had a dirty dream

18:51.431 --> 18:53.433
about an old fling.

18:53.433 --> 18:55.435
Give me a break.

18:56.369 --> 18:57.570
- CONNOR: Okay, remember.

18:57.570 --> 18:58.905
We need three of us
to keep him stable.

18:58.905 --> 19:01.874
We've got ex-girlfriend,
her husband, and watch out.

19:01.874 --> 19:03.810
His recurring nightmare is...

19:03.810 --> 19:05.378
pretty weird.

19:05.378 --> 19:06.813
How we looking, Larry?

19:06.813 --> 19:08.981
- I've got fantasy land and
all her players dialed in.

19:08.981 --> 19:09.882
- Okay.

19:09.882 --> 19:10.983
His theta levels are spiking.

19:10.983 --> 19:12.051
He must already be in the
Brain Frame.

19:12.051 --> 19:12.919
Larry, which hatch
are we in, again?

19:12.919 --> 19:15.622
- Hatch número three, boss.

19:15.622 --> 19:17.557
- This isn't exactly what I
had in mind for our business.

19:17.557 --> 19:18.825
- Oh.

19:18.825 --> 19:21.528
Says the girl who negotiated
him up to $500.

19:21.528 --> 19:22.662
- Touché.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
- But, look, after we're
done with sick Eli,

19:25.565 --> 19:27.099
I have some ideas I want to
talk to you guys about.

19:27.099 --> 19:28.601
- Yeah, I actually have a few
things I wanted to talk to you

19:28.601 --> 19:32.239
about also, maybe we could get
coffee or some Italian food-

19:32.239 --> 19:33.240
- [click]

19:35.742 --> 19:38.645
- [liquid gurgling]

19:38.645 --> 19:40.880
- What is this?

19:40.880 --> 19:43.483
- Where am I?

19:43.483 --> 19:44.217
- Linda?!

19:44.217 --> 19:45.352
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.254
Easy. Easy, Eli.

19:47.254 --> 19:48.521
Remember, we talked
about this.

19:48.521 --> 19:49.989
Okay, this is just the
simulation that helps

19:49.989 --> 19:52.525
partition your dreams for you.

19:52.525 --> 19:53.593
It's ingenious, really.

19:53.593 --> 19:54.861
- Looks like a shitty sewer
in here.

19:54.861 --> 19:56.028
- It's not a shi-

19:56.028 --> 19:56.896
- We're working on
upgrading it, buddy.

19:56.896 --> 19:58.431
But don't worry about that.

19:58.431 --> 20:01.968
All you've got to concentrate
on now is sweet, sweet Linda.

20:01.968 --> 20:02.702
- I really do miss her.

20:02.702 --> 20:03.836
- Of course you do.

20:03.836 --> 20:04.937
And you should.

20:04.937 --> 20:06.406
But you can tell her
that yourself.

20:06.406 --> 20:09.576
Because, she is waiting for
you right behind this door.

20:09.576 --> 20:11.878
- [dental drill whirs,
pained screaming]

20:11.878 --> 20:12.445
- What was that?

20:12.445 --> 20:13.480
- Nothing.

20:14.814 --> 20:15.982
- Hey, Larry?

20:15.982 --> 20:16.716
I thought you said
hatch number three.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.917
- Oh, that's my bad.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.319
Yeah.

20:19.319 --> 20:20.720
Sorry, sometimes the, uh,
dyslexia gets the best of me.

20:20.720 --> 20:21.888
That's uh, one hatch.

20:21.888 --> 20:23.923
One... hatch.

20:23.923 --> 20:24.791
- Spit it out, bud.

20:24.791 --> 20:25.758
- Ha...

20:25.758 --> 20:26.493
Hatch one!

20:26.493 --> 20:27.627
- Hatch number one.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.261
- What's behind
hatch number three?

20:28.261 --> 20:29.095
- Oh, nothing.

20:29.095 --> 20:29.862
It's... that one's broken.

20:29.862 --> 20:32.064
So we use it for storage.

20:32.064 --> 20:33.065
Here we go.

20:33.065 --> 20:34.734
Linda awaits.

20:35.635 --> 20:36.869
- Okay.

20:36.869 --> 20:38.338
Oh God...

20:42.575 --> 20:49.449
- [music builds]

20:49.449 --> 20:58.458
[dramatic music]

20:58.458 --> 21:03.863
[audience cheers]

21:03.863 --> 21:04.931
- ELI: Oh God.

21:04.931 --> 21:06.766
She's just like
I remember her.

21:06.766 --> 21:08.968
- Of course she is, Eli.

21:10.002 --> 21:11.571
Are you ready?

21:11.571 --> 21:18.378
- [audience cheering]

21:18.378 --> 21:19.479
- This is wrong, right?

21:19.479 --> 21:20.980
- Of course it is.

21:20.980 --> 21:21.781
But if this is the only way I
can keep my research going,

21:21.781 --> 21:23.350
then we're gonna do it.

21:23.350 --> 21:24.250
- I don't like it.

21:24.250 --> 21:24.951
I don't think Hannah likes it.

21:24.951 --> 21:26.886
- Nobody likes it.

21:26.886 --> 21:28.521
Except maybe Berkman.

21:32.592 --> 21:36.596
- Imaginary ladies and gentlemen
of Eli's subconscious!

21:36.596 --> 21:37.730
How you feelin' tonight?

21:37.730 --> 21:38.965
- [cheering]

21:38.965 --> 21:40.733
- You think Hannah's really
committed to this

21:40.733 --> 21:42.001
whole break-up thing?

21:42.001 --> 21:43.370
I mean, she came back,
which is a good sign.

21:43.370 --> 21:43.870
But she, she's been acting
pretty cold towards me.

21:43.870 --> 21:44.371
- Sam!

21:44.371 --> 21:46.639
Relax.

21:46.639 --> 21:49.108
Don't let your anxiety
bleed into this dream.

21:49.108 --> 21:50.577
- Okay, cool.

21:50.577 --> 21:51.711
Cool

21:51.711 --> 21:52.845
- May I have your attention,
please.

21:52.845 --> 21:56.583
- Are you ready for the
main event?

21:56.583 --> 21:58.418
- [cheering]

21:58.418 --> 22:00.387
- Center stage!

22:00.387 --> 22:03.823
Lying down in her
childhood bed.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.792
Put you hands together...

22:05.792 --> 22:07.026
For...

22:07.026 --> 22:08.461
Linda!

22:08.461 --> 22:12.532
- [cheering]

22:12.532 --> 22:18.037
- And to my left: the sickest,
twistedest piece of shit I know.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.906
Eli!

22:22.709 --> 22:24.511
- Yeah!

22:24.844 --> 22:26.112
- We have a special guest
with us tonight,

22:26.112 --> 22:27.747
ladies and gentlemen...

22:27.747 --> 22:29.949
Linda's husband.

22:29.949 --> 22:31.651
Neurosurgeon.

22:31.651 --> 22:33.820
- [laughter]

22:33.820 --> 22:35.187
- Father of three.

22:35.187 --> 22:36.689
One's adopted.

22:36.689 --> 22:38.157
- [jeering]

22:38.157 --> 22:41.193
- The guy who just beat cancer.

22:41.193 --> 22:45.465
- [laughter and jeering]

22:45.465 --> 22:48.200
- Audience, why don't you tell
him what you think of Paul?!

22:48.200 --> 22:53.606
- [overpowering boos]

22:53.606 --> 22:54.774
- But tonight's
not about Paul.

22:54.774 --> 22:57.176
It's Eli's night.

22:57.176 --> 22:59.946
Eli.

22:59.946 --> 23:01.781
The stage is yours.

23:02.549 --> 23:04.851
- [inspirational music]

23:04.851 --> 23:06.719
- Linda?

23:08.755 --> 23:10.056
You ready to do this?

23:10.056 --> 23:11.591
- Oh, Eli.

23:11.591 --> 23:13.059
You know I am!

23:13.693 --> 23:14.894
Hey, Paul!

23:14.894 --> 23:18.164
Get ready to see how
a real man does it!

23:18.164 --> 23:19.732
- Linda, why would you do this?

23:19.732 --> 23:21.000
We- we have a
wonderful marriage!

23:21.000 --> 23:24.136
- [clothes tearing]

23:24.136 --> 23:24.937
- Yeah!

23:24.937 --> 23:26.539
Woo!

23:26.539 --> 23:27.507
- No!

23:27.507 --> 23:28.608
- Yeah!

23:28.608 --> 23:29.408
- [cheering]

23:29.408 --> 23:31.010
- You like this, Paul?!

23:31.010 --> 23:34.681
- No, no! No!

23:34.681 --> 23:36.248
- Linda!

23:36.248 --> 23:38.084
- [pleasured moans]

23:38.084 --> 23:39.118
- Linda, no!

23:39.118 --> 23:40.152
I love you so much!

23:40.152 --> 23:41.253
- I want a divorce!

23:41.253 --> 23:42.021
- Oh!

23:42.021 --> 23:44.624
Shots fired by Linda!

23:44.624 --> 23:50.630
- [music and cheering]

23:50.630 --> 23:52.231
[muffled music and cheering]

23:52.231 --> 23:59.672
- SAM: [panicked breathing]

23:59.672 --> 24:02.041
- Yeah!

24:02.041 --> 24:04.944
- Ah!

24:04.944 --> 24:06.278
- Who are you?!

24:06.278 --> 24:07.514
- Sam Wittington.

24:07.514 --> 24:09.749
What is it that you can't
understand about the

24:09.749 --> 24:12.284
Pythagorean Theorem?

24:12.284 --> 24:13.820
Why can't you be smart?

24:13.820 --> 24:14.754
Like your father?

24:14.754 --> 24:15.488
- Sam.

24:15.488 --> 24:16.756
Who is that woman?!

24:16.756 --> 24:19.025
- Oh, it's just my fifth grade
math teacher.

24:19.025 --> 24:20.359
- Ladies and gentlemen!

24:20.359 --> 24:21.794
We're having some minor
technical difficulties,

24:21.794 --> 24:24.764
please, uh, stick with us,
we'll be right back shortly.

24:24.764 --> 24:25.832
- Larry.

24:25.832 --> 24:26.799
What the hell's going on?

24:26.799 --> 24:27.667
- I have no idea.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.702
His brainwaves are still stable.

24:31.904 --> 24:33.472
- It's Sam.

24:34.674 --> 24:35.942
- He's causing this.

24:37.309 --> 24:38.477
- Damn it, Sam!

24:38.477 --> 24:39.478
Stop making everything
about yourself!

24:39.478 --> 24:41.180
- I don't know
what's happening.

24:42.949 --> 24:44.684
- Oh!

24:44.684 --> 24:46.185
What's happening to me?!

24:46.185 --> 24:47.319
- [screaming]

24:47.319 --> 24:49.021
- Let's have a look
at those fangs.

24:49.021 --> 24:50.823
I mean teeth.

24:50.823 --> 24:51.724
- No!

24:51.724 --> 24:52.925
No!

24:53.993 --> 24:54.761
- Larry!

24:54.761 --> 24:55.261
Cancel the simulation!

24:55.261 --> 24:55.995
- No!

24:55.995 --> 24:56.729
Get me out of here!

24:56.729 --> 24:59.031
Get me out of here!

24:59.031 --> 25:01.300
Ah!

25:01.300 --> 25:02.134
- [vomiting]

25:02.134 --> 25:03.603
- What the hell was that?!

25:03.603 --> 25:05.905
- Just a minor hiccup.

25:05.905 --> 25:07.273
- Then why is my
dick bleeding?!

25:07.273 --> 25:08.541
- Well, that's a
new side effect.

25:08.541 --> 25:10.076
- I will be able to help you
with that, sir.

25:10.076 --> 25:11.578
- Get the fuck away from me!

25:12.144 --> 25:12.912
- Whoa.

25:12.912 --> 25:13.813
Eli.

25:13.813 --> 25:15.848
Hey, hey.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.083
- We don't take Discover.

25:17.083 --> 25:17.850
Yet.

25:17.850 --> 25:18.585
- I'm not paying you.

25:18.585 --> 25:20.286
You people are sick!

25:20.286 --> 25:22.121
Sick!

25:22.121 --> 25:23.990
- [door slams shut]

25:23.990 --> 25:25.858
[door opens]

25:25.858 --> 25:28.728
- And you couldn't
even get Hakeem.

25:30.963 --> 25:32.531
- [door closes]

25:34.100 --> 25:35.702
- [vomiting]

25:36.769 --> 25:38.638
- Anyone else have
a bloody penis?

25:40.206 --> 25:41.874
- I guess...

25:41.874 --> 25:43.676
you could say it
was Sam's fault.

25:43.676 --> 25:44.510
- It was definitely
Sam's fault.

25:44.510 --> 25:47.747
- It's always Sam's fault.

25:51.317 --> 25:52.652
- Sam.

25:52.652 --> 25:54.220
What do you think triggered
your anxieties to invade

25:54.220 --> 25:55.788
Eli's dream?

25:58.925 --> 25:59.992
- Sam!

25:59.992 --> 26:00.660
- I don't know.

26:00.660 --> 26:01.460
- Come on, man.

26:01.460 --> 26:02.695
That's not good enough.

26:02.695 --> 26:04.831
I can't have you back
in the Brain Frame.

26:04.831 --> 26:05.732
- What?

26:05.732 --> 26:07.166
Why?

26:07.166 --> 26:08.668
- Because you just cost us
half a grand, and now I have

26:08.668 --> 26:11.804
to make sure that Eli doesn't
quit my co-ed soccer league.

26:11.804 --> 26:13.172
- You guys said you need
three people in there

26:13.172 --> 26:14.040
to guide the dreamer.

26:14.040 --> 26:15.407
Who else are you gonna get?

26:15.407 --> 26:16.208
- Not Larry.

26:16.208 --> 26:17.243
- Definitely not Larry.

26:17.243 --> 26:18.144
- Yeah.

26:18.144 --> 26:20.179
I'd be a trainwreck in there.

26:20.179 --> 26:21.981
I've got some serious demons.

26:21.981 --> 26:22.749
- See?

26:22.749 --> 26:24.216
I'm your only option.

26:30.790 --> 26:31.991
- No, no, no.

26:31.991 --> 26:33.993
No.

26:33.993 --> 26:35.161
No.

26:35.161 --> 26:35.795
Not me.

26:35.795 --> 26:37.163
I'm not doing it.

26:37.163 --> 26:38.798
I'm the one who got us almost
killed by Mexican Santa,

26:38.798 --> 26:40.166
remember?

26:40.166 --> 26:43.169
- Whoa, first of all, the
proper term is Latino Santa.

26:43.169 --> 26:45.404
Second of all, you're the
only one of us who's been

26:45.404 --> 26:46.773
under that thing.

26:46.773 --> 26:48.174
- Yeah, he's right, Hannah.

26:48.174 --> 26:50.176
Your empathy could be the
critical component needed for

26:50.176 --> 26:51.443
keeping the dreamers stable.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.278
- No way.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.279
No.

26:53.279 --> 26:54.146
Way.

26:54.146 --> 26:54.814
- What else are we gonna do?

26:54.814 --> 26:55.614
- I don't care.

26:55.614 --> 26:57.349
Look, I'm not doing it.

26:57.349 --> 26:58.718
- We'll pay you more.

26:58.718 --> 26:59.418
- What are you talking about?

26:59.418 --> 27:00.152
- I'm negotiating.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.121
She is a business woman.

27:02.121 --> 27:03.089
- You don't have the
power to negotiate.

27:03.089 --> 27:04.957
- How much more?

27:04.957 --> 27:08.060
- Well, after the jackoffs
pay the Dean their 20k.

27:08.060 --> 27:10.697
You get...

27:10.697 --> 27:11.297
thirty percent.

27:11.297 --> 27:11.931
- Forty percent.

27:11.931 --> 27:12.464
- Thirty five.

27:12.464 --> 27:12.932
- Deal.

27:12.932 --> 27:13.666
But.

27:13.666 --> 27:16.068
I get the CFO title.

27:16.068 --> 27:16.903
- Touché.

27:16.903 --> 27:18.204
- Alright.

27:18.204 --> 27:19.672
All this negotiating is
fantastic, but it doesn't

27:19.672 --> 27:22.809
change the simple fact that
we don't have any customers.

27:22.809 --> 27:24.143
- Oh.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.211
That's our three o'clock.

27:25.211 --> 27:26.212
He's early.

27:26.212 --> 27:27.546
- Come again?

27:27.546 --> 27:30.216
- Oh, you guys didn't think
I just got one customer?

27:30.216 --> 27:30.950
No.

27:30.950 --> 27:32.484
Check the iCal I set up.

27:32.484 --> 27:35.087
We have two more today, three
tomorrow and one on Saturday.

27:35.087 --> 27:36.022
- At 200 bucks a pop?

27:36.022 --> 27:36.789
- Yeah.

27:36.789 --> 27:37.990
I think you're right.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.225
We can probably bump
it up a little bit.

27:39.225 --> 27:41.761
Oh, but this guy doesn't
want any weird sex stuff.

27:41.761 --> 27:45.164
He just wants to ride a dragon
that sounds like Sean Connery.

27:45.164 --> 27:48.100
So why don't we pull up some
clips from DragonHeart?

27:48.100 --> 27:48.868
- Okay.

27:48.868 --> 27:50.236
Larry, let's get to work.

27:51.270 --> 27:51.771
- (in a Sean Connery voice)
Sit down.

27:51.771 --> 27:53.272
Sit down.

27:53.272 --> 27:54.807
Sit down.

27:54.807 --> 27:57.309
Hello.

27:57.309 --> 28:00.412
- [door closes]

28:00.412 --> 28:00.913
- Okay.

28:00.913 --> 28:02.314
Um...

28:02.314 --> 28:06.452
Look, it's not that I was hurt
that Hannah took my role.

28:06.452 --> 28:09.756
It's just that she never even
acknowledged my feelings.

28:09.756 --> 28:10.489
You know what I mean?

28:10.489 --> 28:11.323
I have feelings too.

28:11.323 --> 28:12.424
The thing about Hannah is-

28:12.424 --> 28:13.059
- [door opening]

28:13.059 --> 28:14.360
- Mullins, Hobbs.

28:14.360 --> 28:14.994
We need you now.

28:14.994 --> 28:18.264
It's the lab.

28:18.264 --> 28:19.999
- But you...

28:21.901 --> 28:22.969
- [door closes]

28:22.969 --> 28:28.074
[alarms]

28:28.074 --> 28:29.341
- Where the hell is our feed?

28:29.341 --> 28:31.110
- We lost it 10 minutes ago.

28:31.110 --> 28:32.711
- Who do we have in the field?

28:36.783 --> 28:37.950
- Oh my God!

28:37.950 --> 28:39.285
Come on!

28:39.285 --> 28:41.120
Open the door!

28:44.523 --> 28:48.294
[screaming]

28:48.294 --> 28:55.534
- [mysterious music]

28:55.534 --> 28:58.104
- [silence]

28:58.104 --> 29:08.080
[instrumental music]

29:08.080 --> 29:18.090
* *

29:18.090 --> 29:28.100
* *

29:28.100 --> 29:38.110
* *

29:38.110 --> 29:48.120
* *

29:48.120 --> 29:58.130
* *

29:58.130 --> 30:09.141
* *

30:09.141 --> 30:20.152
* *

30:20.152 --> 30:31.163
* *
