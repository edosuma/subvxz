00:35.580 --> 00:38.850
'What do we see when
we look in the mirror?

00:38.900 --> 00:40.690
'Our truest selves?

00:40.740 --> 00:46.500
'Or a faint approximation
of someone we'd rather be?

00:48.220 --> 00:50.050
'The mirror sees it all.

00:50.100 --> 00:55.130
'Our fears, our little triumphs,
and keeps our secrets,

00:55.180 --> 00:57.720
'holds our disappointments in.'

01:04.340 --> 01:06.650
Nuns are supposed to be frugal.

01:06.700 --> 01:10.570
~ Maybe I shouldn't have bought cut flowers.
~ It's only a few dahlias!

01:10.620 --> 01:13.170
They might think I'm extravagant.

01:13.220 --> 01:16.290
Maybe I should have bought
a pot plant instead.

01:16.340 --> 01:18.530
They've invited us to tea
to celebrate our news.

01:18.580 --> 01:21.290
~ You don't have to give them anything.
~ But, Fred, it's an honour.

01:21.340 --> 01:23.730
People like them inviting
people like us.

01:23.780 --> 01:25.690
You'd understand if you was a woman.

01:25.740 --> 01:28.740
If I was a woman, we
wouldn't be engaged.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.410
Fred!

01:31.500 --> 01:32.770
I'm nervous.

01:32.820 --> 01:34.610
Don't be.

01:34.660 --> 01:37.690
It's just one big, happy family.

01:37.740 --> 01:40.370
SISTER EVANGELINA COUGHS

01:40.420 --> 01:42.730
It's not working, Sister Evangelina.

01:42.780 --> 01:44.300
BOTH: Oh!

01:45.740 --> 01:47.810
I think the chimney must be blocked.

01:47.860 --> 01:52.500
Blocked, no doubt, because of
a certain handyman's negligence.

01:53.700 --> 01:55.530
Pass me the poker.

01:55.580 --> 01:59.090
I think it likely it is
trammelled by a bird's nest.

01:59.140 --> 02:05.210
According to its species, doom
of several aspects might ensue.

02:05.260 --> 02:09.570
I should shudder more were
it to prove a jackdaw.

02:09.620 --> 02:11.650
Or a magpie.

02:11.700 --> 02:16.020
It's probably a stork with
a slightly singed backside.

02:17.610 --> 02:18.610
Oh!

02:18.660 --> 02:19.890
SHE SIGHS

02:19.940 --> 02:21.450
Ugh!

02:21.500 --> 02:23.610
SHE SPLUTTERS

02:23.660 --> 02:28.730
Fred should have had this
chimney swept in September

02:28.780 --> 02:32.010
when we didn't need a fire,
instead of mooning about like

02:32.060 --> 02:36.060
~ Billy Bunter struck by Cupid's dart.
~ DOORBELL RINGS

02:37.500 --> 02:39.930
Fred. Mrs Gee.

02:39.980 --> 02:43.210
It's so good of you to come and
share your happiness with us.

02:43.260 --> 02:45.130
It's good of you to invite us.

02:45.180 --> 02:47.850
Oh, dahlias, how very extravagant!

02:52.020 --> 02:56.690
~ Excuse me, what's that?
~ It's an engagement cake.

02:56.740 --> 02:59.730
Decorated with buttercream
and crystallised violets.

02:59.780 --> 03:02.450
A sort of pun on Mrs
Gee's first name.

03:02.500 --> 03:04.530
I meant underneath it.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.970
It's, um, silver board.

03:07.020 --> 03:10.410
It's a silver board that went
under my engagement cake.

03:10.460 --> 03:14.250
~ I thought it had been thrown out.
~ Why would we do that?

03:14.300 --> 03:17.650
~ It cost 2 and 11.
~ Don't worry, Trixie.

03:17.700 --> 03:21.300
I'm sure it won't bring them
bad luck, or anything.

03:25.460 --> 03:27.770
This little piggy went to market.

03:27.820 --> 03:29.770
This little piggy stayed at home.

03:29.820 --> 03:32.170
This little piggy had roast beef.

03:32.220 --> 03:34.570
And this little piggy had none.

03:34.620 --> 03:39.210
And this little piggy
went "Wee, wee, wee,"

03:39.260 --> 03:42.570
all the way to Walton-on-the-Naze
to see his grandparents.

03:42.620 --> 03:46.610
~ Camilla, can we steer clear of the W word?
~ What, Walton-on-the-Naze?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.210
No, wee-wee.

03:48.260 --> 03:52.610
~ He's going to get confused and
we've two hours' drive ahead of us.
~ Sorry.

03:52.660 --> 03:55.450
I'm aware there are better
times for me to be going off

03:55.500 --> 03:58.170
to do a fortnight's
course at the London.

03:58.220 --> 04:02.130
But we've made great leaps forward
with this little lavatory seat.

04:02.180 --> 04:05.330
~ Simple pleasures, eh?
~ Have faith.

04:05.380 --> 04:08.580
He'll be running for gold at
the potty Olympics in no time.

04:09.740 --> 04:11.210
Come here.

04:15.580 --> 04:18.209
Camilla? You've forgotten something.

04:18.260 --> 04:20.019
Good Lord.

04:24.340 --> 04:26.730
~ I love you.
~ I love you.

04:26.780 --> 04:28.460
ENGINE STARTS

04:33.420 --> 04:35.570
Oh... Peter!

04:35.620 --> 04:37.100
Peter!

04:38.300 --> 04:39.940
SHE SIGHS

04:44.740 --> 04:48.890
~ May you both be happy always.
~ Thank you.

04:48.940 --> 04:52.090
So, have you established a date
for these nuptials, Mrs Gee?

04:52.140 --> 04:53.810
Well, it won't be far off.

04:53.860 --> 04:57.090
My son lives in Plymouth and he's
due some leave from the Navy,

04:57.140 --> 04:58.810
so I'd like it to be then.

04:58.860 --> 05:00.930
What about your daughters, Fred?

05:00.980 --> 05:04.010
Oh, Dolly and Marlene? Dolly's
moved to Australia.

05:04.060 --> 05:07.570
~ She'd have only just got the letter.
~ Oh, I thought she lived in Canada.

05:07.620 --> 05:13.610
No, that's Marlene. She's back home
now. She's settled in Birmingham.

05:13.660 --> 05:17.210
I imagine she's already browsing
the catalogue for outfits.

05:17.260 --> 05:20.860
~ We haven't heard anything yet, have we?
~ I'm sure we will.

05:23.500 --> 05:25.170
DOORBELL RINGS

05:27.900 --> 05:30.090
Nurse Noakes!

05:30.140 --> 05:33.700
You are restored to us!

05:35.980 --> 05:39.690
Ah! And you have come supplied.

05:39.740 --> 05:44.450
Which is just as well for we have
guests of uncommon appetite today.

05:44.500 --> 05:46.450
I'm frightfully vexed at being late.

05:46.500 --> 05:49.290
I was rather hoping for
a morsel of pork pie.

05:49.340 --> 05:52.050
Dost thou think that because
thou art virtuous

05:52.100 --> 05:54.970
there should be no
more cakes and ale?

05:56.420 --> 05:58.130
Sorry, Sister Monica Joan.

05:58.180 --> 06:00.320
It's my mother's ashes.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.250
They are of comfort to you perhaps.

06:08.300 --> 06:09.900
Yes, and no.

06:10.980 --> 06:15.930
Let's not take her to the party. She
was such a stickler for etiquette.

06:15.980 --> 06:19.280
She'd never go anywhere
without an invitation.

06:37.620 --> 06:41.450
~ Long time no see, Maureen.
~ Hello, Carole.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.450
How's life since you got rehoused?

06:43.500 --> 06:47.250
I swear, that tower block
wobbles when it's windy.

06:47.300 --> 06:50.810
~ What are you doing here, dare I ask?
~ In the family way again.

06:50.860 --> 06:53.770
They reckon there's going to be a pill
soon that can stop it happening.

06:53.820 --> 06:57.370
~ There's a pill for everything nowadays.
~ Is Ted pleased?

06:57.420 --> 07:01.490
~ Over the moon. He's away
now, though, at sea.
~ Oh, of course.

07:01.540 --> 07:03.290
I'd forgotten.

07:03.340 --> 07:09.450
Baby Cohen, Baby Kelly,
Baby Singh, Baby Prichard.

07:09.500 --> 07:10.970
Doctor's been delayed

07:11.020 --> 07:14.450
so the vaccination appointments have
all been put back by half an hour.

07:14.500 --> 07:19.690
~ Sorry, ladies.
~ I may as well feed him
here. He's ever so obliging.

07:19.740 --> 07:24.210
He never minds if it's cold. You'd
be a fool to feed them fresh, really.

07:24.260 --> 07:28.450
Listen to what's in this.
Macaroni, bacon, and tomato.

07:28.500 --> 07:30.290
SHE RETCHES

07:30.340 --> 07:33.650
Nurse! Nurse!

07:33.700 --> 07:36.170
Hello, my love, you all right?

07:37.980 --> 07:39.850
All right, fellas?

07:41.580 --> 07:43.320
Hello, darling.

07:45.620 --> 07:47.900
Morning.

07:55.540 --> 07:59.890
~ Talk about a sight for sore eyes.
~ Marlene!

07:59.940 --> 08:03.370
I'm hardly the Avon Lady, Dad.

08:03.420 --> 08:06.450
Although, judging by the smell
of you, she's been here already.

08:06.500 --> 08:09.620
Oh, it's only a bit of Old Spice.
Got to keep the standards up now.

08:10.620 --> 08:16.060
~ Did you get the letter,
about my lady friend?
~ Yes, Dad... I did.

08:18.420 --> 08:20.970
I'll take this away, if
the moment has passed.

08:21.020 --> 08:24.250
Nothing brings on sickness faster
than staring at the empty bowl.

08:24.300 --> 08:28.370
A tea leaf... in my tea brought
it on this morning.

08:28.420 --> 08:30.890
I've been like this since
I missed my first monthly.

08:30.940 --> 08:34.650
If I was a gambling woman,
I'd put five bob on a girl.

08:34.700 --> 08:37.770
I've rinsed out Mrs Gadsby's handbag
and brought her a nice cup of tea.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.450
Thanks.

08:39.500 --> 08:43.299
~ Would you mind just putting it over there?
~ Of course.

08:44.260 --> 08:46.930
Would you like a Polo mint?
I've got some in my pocket.

08:46.980 --> 08:49.580
~ I didn't hear that.
~ Yes, please.

08:51.620 --> 08:53.410
Mind over matter.

08:53.460 --> 08:56.500
And Polo mints. That's what'll
get you through this.

09:03.220 --> 09:05.620
~ Knock knock!
~ Come in.

09:07.420 --> 09:10.050
Poor thing. Have you got a hangover?

09:10.100 --> 09:11.610
How could I be hungover?

09:11.660 --> 09:13.810
I haven't even been to bed yet,

09:13.860 --> 09:16.610
let alone had anything
stronger than Bournvita.

09:16.660 --> 09:18.650
I got rather a shock when I realised

09:18.700 --> 09:21.700
Nonnatus House had moved
on from Horlicks.

09:24.740 --> 09:27.330
Still, the bathroom
smells just the same.

09:27.380 --> 09:29.370
Palmolive and Izal.

09:29.420 --> 09:32.720
The girls at the mother
and baby home use Lux.

09:39.220 --> 09:41.210
Whatever are you doing?

09:41.260 --> 09:43.400
Applying a protein mask.

09:44.460 --> 09:48.540
My complexion appears to be at the
crossroads of youth and old age.

09:49.660 --> 09:52.010
This morning, I found the
beginnings of a pimple.

09:52.060 --> 09:54.450
And a line beneath each eye.

09:54.500 --> 09:57.170
I don't even look in the
mirror with my glasses on.

09:57.220 --> 09:59.890
My whole face is sort
of sliding downwards,

09:59.940 --> 10:02.610
like a rather exhausted blancmange.

10:03.460 --> 10:05.730
Do you suppose it would
be as effective to take on

10:05.780 --> 10:08.370
the protein in the form of,
say, a fried egg sandwich?

10:08.420 --> 10:09.850
Or some custard?

10:09.900 --> 10:11.380
No.

10:17.980 --> 10:20.970
Yours is the one without the spoon.

10:21.020 --> 10:23.730
No sugar cos you're sweet enough.

10:23.780 --> 10:26.370
She's keeping your dust
down, at any rate.

10:26.420 --> 10:29.570
I don't have Violet coming around
here doing my housework, Marlene.

10:29.620 --> 10:31.890
She's got a business to
run and a home of her own.

10:31.940 --> 10:33.530
Where does that leave you, Dad?

10:33.580 --> 10:35.810
Well, I've handed notice
on this place,

10:35.860 --> 10:39.060
so when we're married,
I'll move in with her.

10:40.580 --> 10:43.250
I thought she'd come and live here.

10:44.260 --> 10:46.130
Well, she lives over her shop.

10:46.180 --> 10:49.690
~ It would be a bit handier.
~ Well, handy for who?
~ Marlene!

10:49.740 --> 10:52.210
I knew you hadn't thought
this through, Dad.

10:52.260 --> 10:55.700
That's why I brought an overnight bag,
so I can stay here until you do.

10:57.300 --> 11:00.050
Mater would thoroughly
approve of this.

11:00.100 --> 11:02.900
She always wanted me to slenderise.

11:04.300 --> 11:07.570
Then, when she was dying, she pushed
a plate of scones towards me

11:07.620 --> 11:10.770
and said, "Camilla,
look after your face.

11:10.820 --> 11:13.900
"The other end's for sitting
on, nobody will ever see it."

11:18.260 --> 11:20.330
It's her anniversary coming up.

11:20.380 --> 11:23.370
I'm going to scatter her
ashes in commemoration.

11:23.420 --> 11:25.850
Somewhere where she was happy.

11:25.900 --> 11:28.130
I can't take them back to India.

11:28.180 --> 11:30.850
And they'd take a rather dim
view of it all in the food hall

11:30.900 --> 11:32.840
at Fortnum & Mason.

11:33.700 --> 11:36.940
Burnt cinder crunching underfoot.

11:38.460 --> 11:42.380
The truth is I haven't the
first idea where to put her.

11:43.740 --> 11:47.770
She floated through life
like a beautiful scarf.

11:47.820 --> 11:49.940
Or a trace of perfume.

11:51.660 --> 11:54.610
I'm not sure anywhere
left its mark on her.

11:54.660 --> 11:56.800
Or, indeed, vice versa.

12:00.300 --> 12:01.900
BRAKES SQUEAL

12:05.140 --> 12:07.280
Hello, midwife calling.

12:09.780 --> 12:13.580
I see someone's dashing away
with the smoothing iron.

12:20.580 --> 12:22.260
Sorry.

12:27.500 --> 12:30.420
Yes, I'd absolutely adore one.

12:35.060 --> 12:37.740
Bourbons, my favourite.

12:46.060 --> 12:49.360
Did you have regular checkups
with your old GP?

13:02.180 --> 13:03.610
Forgive me.

13:03.660 --> 13:06.760
When was the last time
you saw your doctor?

13:26.820 --> 13:28.660
Dr Cartmell...

13:30.340 --> 13:32.370
.. Manchester.

13:32.420 --> 13:33.970
DOOR CLOSES

13:34.020 --> 13:36.260
Hello, beautiful.

13:37.780 --> 13:40.730
Apologies, Nurse. I did promise her
I'd be home before you got here

13:40.780 --> 13:43.130
but the chief clerk
wouldn't let me go.

13:43.180 --> 13:44.890
I'm Kevin Dillen.

13:44.940 --> 13:49.530
Nurse Franklin. Do you speak
sign language, Mr Dillen?

13:49.580 --> 13:52.250
The minute I clapped eyes
on June, I made up my mind

13:52.300 --> 13:54.490
to learn sign language,

13:54.540 --> 13:56.340
and learn I did.

14:00.740 --> 14:04.090
She says I won't win
any prizes, but I'm OK.

14:04.140 --> 14:05.250
Oh!

14:05.300 --> 14:10.450
And did Mrs Dillen's husband
translate adequately?

14:10.500 --> 14:14.650
We had a certain amount of fun and
games with "cervix" and "vagina".

14:14.700 --> 14:17.650
But, all in all, I think
we did quite well.

14:17.700 --> 14:20.490
I explained how we'd help
her with her home delivery,

14:20.540 --> 14:22.210
and she seemed frightfully keen...

14:22.260 --> 14:25.570
especially when I said her
husband could stay with her.

14:25.620 --> 14:27.610
Can you pass the pickles,
please, Barbara?

14:27.660 --> 14:29.810
We've been through this,
time and time again.

14:29.860 --> 14:32.410
There is no need for a man
to be in the delivery rooms!

14:32.460 --> 14:34.170
We don't even need
them to boil water,

14:34.220 --> 14:36.410
so many people have
got immersion heaters.

14:36.460 --> 14:39.210
Nurse Crane, do you have a view?

14:39.260 --> 14:43.290
I've seen it done once, in
an artistic family in Leeds.

14:43.340 --> 14:46.370
Suffice to say, there
was a fainting episode.

14:46.420 --> 14:49.010
And it wasn't the mother.

14:49.060 --> 14:51.650
Well, June's husband doesn't
look like a fainter to me.

14:51.700 --> 14:54.570
He seems extremely sensible.

14:54.620 --> 14:57.450
And if he's the only person
who can communicate with her,

14:57.500 --> 15:00.450
~ she's going to need his
help when the baby's born.
~ And so will we.

15:00.500 --> 15:01.970
I learned some sign language,

15:02.020 --> 15:03.930
when I helped with
the Girls' Brigade,

15:03.980 --> 15:06.050
and I can teach a little to Trixie.

15:06.100 --> 15:10.570
But June needs at least one person
who truly understands her,

15:10.620 --> 15:12.250
and that person...

15:12.300 --> 15:15.170
happens to be the
father of her child.

15:15.580 --> 15:20.260
I rather think that Nurse
Franklin is right.

15:25.060 --> 15:27.000
SLOW ROMANTIC MUSIC

15:33.220 --> 15:36.090
~ Do you want to hear my news?
~ You've given it quite the build-up,

15:36.140 --> 15:38.410
I'm rather afraid it's
going to disappoint.

15:38.460 --> 15:41.450
~ They're knocking down the nurses' home.
~ Really?
~ Well, half of it.

15:41.500 --> 15:43.290
Those of us who
volunteered to move out

15:43.340 --> 15:45.570
and find private digs will
be given a rent allowance.

15:45.620 --> 15:48.090
And I've put my name down.

15:48.140 --> 15:50.850
Oh, Delia, you don't want to
end up in some filthy hole,

15:50.900 --> 15:54.970
~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.
~ No, I don't.

15:55.020 --> 15:58.410
I want to live in a spotless
flat... with you.

15:58.460 --> 16:00.930
Say you will, Pats.

16:00.980 --> 16:02.690
Think of the fun we'd have.

16:02.740 --> 16:05.010
Think how we'd wave each
other off each morning,

16:05.060 --> 16:08.010
and then come home and
close the door at night.

16:08.060 --> 16:09.890
And how we'd talk and talk,

16:09.940 --> 16:12.890
and maybe get a record player.
It would be so easy.

16:12.940 --> 16:16.690
Would it? Are you sure there aren't
any rules saying you can't?

16:16.740 --> 16:20.850
No, there aren't, I checked.
Are there any saying you can't?

16:20.900 --> 16:22.770
I don't have to live at Nonnatus,

16:22.820 --> 16:25.760
it was offered to me
as a sort of perk.

16:26.100 --> 16:28.730
Lots of girls share flats.

16:28.780 --> 16:31.450
Not even a nun would bat an eyelid.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.210
BELL TINKLES

16:38.260 --> 16:40.260
Good morning, madam.

16:41.340 --> 16:43.370
I'm your fiance's daughter.

16:43.420 --> 16:47.170
Marlene Dooley, nee Buckle.
You remember me?

16:47.220 --> 16:49.930
Yes! Yes, I do.

16:49.980 --> 16:52.650
~ Oh, what a lovely surprise.
~ Good.

16:52.700 --> 16:56.570
Because I ain't come in for
two yards of knicker elastic.

16:56.620 --> 17:01.250
I used to come in here with
my mum. Hair ribbons, mostly.

17:01.300 --> 17:03.970
She was hard-pressed to keep
me and Dolly looking nice,

17:04.020 --> 17:08.170
but she made a point about
ribbons. Even during the war.

17:08.220 --> 17:11.010
Blue for your sister,
and yellow for you.

17:11.060 --> 17:12.609
Cigarette?

17:12.660 --> 17:15.290
I don't care for smoking in the shop.

17:15.339 --> 17:17.609
The smell clings to the wool,

17:17.660 --> 17:20.250
and I'm not convinced it
comes out in the wash.

17:20.300 --> 17:22.250
These are mentholated.

17:22.300 --> 17:24.440
Quite a pleasant aroma.

17:35.340 --> 17:40.260
My dad always said no woman could
ever take my mother's place.

17:41.540 --> 17:44.170
And he's absolutely right.

17:44.220 --> 17:48.060
And no man could ever
replace my husband.

17:49.500 --> 17:51.690
You were quite a double
act, you and Mr Gee.

17:51.740 --> 17:55.730
Him with his tripe shop,
and you with this.

17:55.780 --> 17:57.690
We worked hard.

17:57.740 --> 18:00.170
It's what you do when
you want to get on.

18:00.220 --> 18:03.520
Shame my dad never took
a leaf from your book.

18:03.660 --> 18:07.980
Still, he knows a steady
business when he sees it.

18:09.180 --> 18:12.490
Proper little gold mine.

18:12.540 --> 18:14.850
That was the phrase he used.

18:14.900 --> 18:18.850
I believe he's moving in here
after you've done the deed.

18:18.900 --> 18:22.330
It was what we discussed, yes.

18:22.380 --> 18:25.730
I wish I could say I was surprised.

18:25.780 --> 18:29.570
But he's always had an eye
for the main chance, my dad.

18:29.620 --> 18:31.250
BELL TINKLES

18:31.300 --> 18:35.490
~ Good morning, Mrs Becker. Your
dress shields have arrived.
~ Oh, good.

18:35.540 --> 18:38.140
I'll leave you to your clientele.

18:38.860 --> 18:41.850
And, by the way, it was
the other way around.

18:41.900 --> 18:44.690
~ What was?
~ Hair ribbons.

18:44.740 --> 18:46.930
Dolly's were yellow.

18:46.980 --> 18:48.690
Mine were blue.

18:48.740 --> 18:52.690
My dad used to say, "Sky-blue,

18:52.740 --> 18:55.010
"like your mother's eyes."

18:57.620 --> 18:59.380
BELL TINKLES

19:01.060 --> 19:04.690
As this is the first in a new series
of classes, Sister Mary Cynthia

19:04.740 --> 19:09.130
has set up a suggestions box so you
can inform us of our shortcomings.

19:09.180 --> 19:12.650
Comments on the refreshments
are not encouraged.

19:12.700 --> 19:17.900
Mr and Mrs Dillen, how nice
to see you both. Oh...

19:18.900 --> 19:20.340
Hello.

19:21.820 --> 19:24.940
You can lie here.

19:26.980 --> 19:28.530
You're welcome.

19:28.580 --> 19:31.290
Excuse me, what's going on here?

19:31.340 --> 19:34.690
~ June uses sign language to communicate.
~ I don't mean that.

19:34.740 --> 19:37.050
I mean, what's her
old man doing here?

19:37.100 --> 19:40.930
~ If I'd known men were invited,
I'd have brought mine, too!
~ Me, too!

19:40.980 --> 19:44.010
I'm sure we don't want to distract
anyone from honest toil.

19:44.060 --> 19:46.810
I have got to take a load of
book-keeping home with me tonight,

19:46.860 --> 19:49.450
~ make up for lost time.
~ It's a shame my Jack can't do the same

19:49.500 --> 19:52.170
but he can hardly unload crates
of bananas in the parlour.

19:52.220 --> 19:53.450
LAUGHTER

19:53.500 --> 19:56.500
Don't worry, everyone's lovely.

19:59.610 --> 20:00.610
BELL TINKLES

20:00.660 --> 20:04.290
I'm not stopping. The chimney
at Nonnatus is still giving gyp.

20:04.340 --> 20:08.570
Only I was passing the baker's and
they put a tray of meringues out

20:08.620 --> 20:10.050
and I know you love 'em.

20:10.100 --> 20:12.650
~ Yes, I do.
~ They came out a little bit squashed,

20:12.700 --> 20:16.300
so they were selling 'em
two for the price of one.

20:17.060 --> 20:20.530
See you tomorrow morning for
our little constitutional.

20:20.580 --> 20:24.080
Cor. We'll be papering
the parlour with that lot.

20:24.940 --> 20:26.540
BELL TINKLES

20:34.620 --> 20:36.250
Why do you want to move into a flat?

20:36.300 --> 20:37.770
Aren't you happy here?

20:37.820 --> 20:40.820
I'm as happy as I've
ever been in my life.

20:41.820 --> 20:45.220
But there is something that
I find hard to acknowledge.

20:46.220 --> 20:51.570
I have a dark secret. I've
never lived independently.

20:51.620 --> 20:54.290
I've never paid a bill
or bought a pint of milk

20:54.340 --> 20:56.890
or put up a bookshelf in my life.

20:56.940 --> 21:00.500
I have a dark secret
too. Neither have I!

21:02.940 --> 21:07.260
Miss Mount, you will still
join us for lunch each day?

21:08.340 --> 21:09.370
Of course.

21:09.420 --> 21:13.610
A small amount of change is good
for a community. Too much isn't.

21:13.660 --> 21:15.860
Besides, you'd be missed.

21:16.940 --> 21:20.970
I've added a little bit of sugar.
Even a few sips will help.

21:21.020 --> 21:23.250
No, I can't. I'm sorry.

21:23.300 --> 21:24.770
Oh, don't be.

21:24.820 --> 21:26.810
One of the reasons we
make booking-in visits

21:26.860 --> 21:29.610
is to make sure all is well
and, clearly, it isn't.

21:29.660 --> 21:31.340
CHILD GRIZZLES

21:35.780 --> 21:39.250
Have you managed to prepare
any food for Neil today?

21:39.300 --> 21:42.730
I've given him Farley's rusks,
but he don't like them dry

21:42.780 --> 21:44.450
and I can't...

21:45.380 --> 21:48.340
~ I can't face boiling m...
~ Milk?

21:49.420 --> 21:50.960
SHE RETCHES

21:52.060 --> 21:55.330
Is there someone close by who
can... who can call in each day

21:55.380 --> 21:57.690
and help? Your mother, perhaps?

21:57.740 --> 22:00.010
She's over in Bermondsey.

22:00.060 --> 22:03.690
~ We don't speak.
~ What about your husband?

22:03.740 --> 22:08.980
He's in Wormwood Scrubs, love.
Doing three years for burglary.

22:10.100 --> 22:11.890
Doctor has a very busy round today -

22:11.940 --> 22:15.290
I really don't think he can visit
just for morning sickness.

22:15.340 --> 22:18.050
Oh, this is more than morning
sickness, Mrs Turner.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.290
Maureen's been vomiting all day long.

22:20.340 --> 22:24.410
Tell her to pop into clinic next
Tuesday. It's probably all nerves.

22:24.460 --> 22:27.660
I'm sure Doctor will
be able to reassure her.

22:32.020 --> 22:35.130
I love it when you don't
wear a hat or a scarf

22:35.180 --> 22:39.010
and the sun gets the chance
to shine down on your hair.

22:39.060 --> 22:42.850
Shame it don't get a chance
to shine down on mine, eh?

22:42.900 --> 22:47.090
I had an interesting chat in
the shop yesterday about hair.

22:47.140 --> 22:50.010
~ Hair ribbons.
~ Did you? Who with.

22:50.060 --> 22:52.290
Marlene.

22:52.340 --> 22:54.330
I'm sorry, Violet.

22:54.380 --> 22:57.250
Marlene can be a right madam
when she has a mind to be.

22:57.300 --> 22:59.570
I wouldn't have said
she was being a madam.

22:59.620 --> 23:01.930
I would've said she was
trying to be honest.

23:01.980 --> 23:06.050
Honest? What do you mean honest?
She's talking codswallop.

23:06.100 --> 23:08.650
It's not even true codswallop.

23:08.700 --> 23:12.420
Fred, have you or have you not made
any provision for your old age?

23:13.820 --> 23:16.290
I'm looking into setting
up a mushroom farm.

23:16.340 --> 23:19.650
And I haven't given up
on fireworks altogether.

23:19.700 --> 23:22.690
Well, none of them's exactly what
you'd call a little gold mine,

23:22.740 --> 23:24.900
~ though, is it?
~ No.

23:25.900 --> 23:27.610
Fred, why did you ask to marry me

23:27.660 --> 23:29.610
when we could've just stayed friends?

23:29.660 --> 23:32.970
I've got loads of friends - well,
mates - and acquaintances.

23:33.020 --> 23:37.010
~ I haven't had a missus for nearly 20 years.
~ And you're getting on a bit.

23:37.060 --> 23:40.290
Well, old. Whichever
way you want to put it.

23:40.340 --> 23:43.330
Well, yeah, I'm no spring chicken,
but then again, neither are you.

23:43.380 --> 23:45.170
We can look after each
other now, can't we?

23:45.220 --> 23:48.050
I don't need anyone to look
after me, thank you very much.

23:48.100 --> 23:50.090
And if you do, well...

23:50.140 --> 23:55.970
~ Fred, I'm not sure that you're
doing this for the right reasons.
~ I...

23:56.020 --> 23:59.130
I'm doing this because I
thought we fitted together.

23:59.180 --> 24:02.820
~ I thought you were missing
things and so was I.
~ Exactly.

24:04.980 --> 24:09.260
Let's put an end to this. We're
too old to make mistakes.

24:22.540 --> 24:24.210
Morning, Fred.

24:36.540 --> 24:38.540
This'll cheer you up.

24:39.300 --> 24:42.820
Mum always used to say the smell
of bacon made a house a home.

24:46.340 --> 24:47.940
HUBBUB

24:49.700 --> 24:53.770
We'll have people and prams
coming in single file, please.

24:53.820 --> 24:56.760
This isn't the chariot
race in Ben Hur.

24:58.500 --> 25:03.650
Thank you. I'll call in and
collect the registration form.

25:03.700 --> 25:04.690
Yes!

25:04.740 --> 25:08.530
Since when is this hall your
personal wastepaper basket?

25:08.580 --> 25:10.770
I'm sorry, Sister.
I was just pleased.

25:10.820 --> 25:13.410
I managed to find a council nursery
space for Maureen Gadsby's

25:13.460 --> 25:15.610
~ little boy.
~ Oh, you have, have you?

25:15.660 --> 25:18.050
I decided that if her problem
really was nerves,

25:18.100 --> 25:21.810
with more rest and more support, she
might find her sickness resolves.

25:21.860 --> 25:23.410
Well, it's hardly scientific,

25:23.460 --> 25:26.010
but it is full of compassion
and common sense.

25:26.060 --> 25:30.460
And much of the time, that's
all a midwife needs. You'll do.

25:31.460 --> 25:33.450
Now, go and lend a hand
at the weighing table

25:33.500 --> 25:35.640
and put that in the bin.

25:50.660 --> 25:54.370
I feared you had not yet
succeeded in your task.

25:54.420 --> 25:59.370
I looked for a lightness about
you, the sense of a burden gone.

25:59.420 --> 26:02.780
~ But I could not perceive it.
~ No?

26:05.260 --> 26:08.010
Sister Julienne's given me
permission to keep the ashes here,

26:08.060 --> 26:10.330
until I decide what to do.

26:11.100 --> 26:13.250
It didn't seem quite right
keeping her under my bed,

26:13.300 --> 26:14.930
like a pair of slippers.

26:14.980 --> 26:18.380
I shall be eternally glad
when I am transmogrified.

26:19.420 --> 26:22.160
The burden of the flesh is so heavy.

26:22.580 --> 26:25.680
It is no marvel that
the soul feels trapped.

26:26.420 --> 26:30.060
Sister Monica Joan,
I rather suspect...

26:31.500 --> 26:35.690
.. if anything's trapping
poor Mater, it's me.

26:35.740 --> 26:38.010
Then you must release her.

26:39.940 --> 26:41.300
I know.

26:42.300 --> 26:46.060
But where? It's the last
thing I'll ever do for her.

26:47.220 --> 26:50.580
I have to make sure everything's
top-notch and tickety-boo.

26:51.860 --> 26:55.260
All done properly.
Or... or never let go.

27:29.730 --> 27:30.730

27:30.780 --> 27:33.340

Oh, Maureen!

27:41.540 --> 27:43.140
MAUREEN MOANS

27:44.460 --> 27:46.450
Maureen, you need to see a doctor.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.250
SHE MOANS

27:48.300 --> 27:51.300
And this time, he's
going to come to you.

27:58.780 --> 28:01.770
Nonnatus House, midwife
speaking, how may I help you?

28:01.820 --> 28:04.570
'H-hello, this is Kevin Dillon.

28:04.620 --> 28:06.690
'I think June's labour's
just started.'

28:06.740 --> 28:08.080
Dillon.

28:10.140 --> 28:13.570
Of course, the little
deaf and dumb lady.

28:13.620 --> 28:16.560
I shall dispatch her
personal midwives.

28:18.940 --> 28:21.010
And how many times
a day do you vomit?

28:21.060 --> 28:22.780
20 or 30.

28:24.180 --> 28:26.370
Let me put a little Vaseline
on your lips, Maureen,

28:26.420 --> 28:27.770
to soothe them.

28:27.820 --> 28:31.410
I'll be running some blood
tests and some urine tests.

28:31.460 --> 28:35.530
But I don't need either to see
that you're extremely dehydrated.

28:35.580 --> 28:37.810
People keep saying it's my nerves.

28:37.860 --> 28:40.010
It seems to me that
you have a condition

28:40.060 --> 28:43.290
called hyperemesis gravidarum.

28:43.340 --> 28:45.940
It's rare, but very debilitating.

28:46.660 --> 28:49.210
Will I lose it, Doctor? The baby?

28:49.260 --> 28:52.810
Babies are tough little
things, Mrs Gadsby.

28:52.860 --> 28:54.930
But if we can't sort out some fluids,

28:54.980 --> 28:57.450
we're more likely to lose you.

29:02.420 --> 29:04.450
I'm sorry, June.

29:04.500 --> 29:08.140
Can you tell her I don't think
things are on the move just yet?

29:09.860 --> 29:11.530
Not ready yet.

29:12.220 --> 29:14.890
I know, I know, it's disappointing.

29:16.260 --> 29:18.570
~ False alarm, I'm afraid.
~ Oh.

29:18.620 --> 29:22.740
Baby will come soon,
just... not today.

29:26.900 --> 29:28.570
Tell me, June.

29:32.260 --> 29:34.060
You can tell me.

29:36.140 --> 29:38.810
She says, "I want to meet my baby."

29:39.820 --> 29:43.120
She says, "I thought I
would meet him tonight.

29:43.420 --> 29:44.770
"I feel him kick.

29:44.820 --> 29:47.290
"I feel him turn inside of me.

29:48.580 --> 29:50.290
"I put my hand here,

29:50.340 --> 29:53.340
"here where I feel
his fist, or his foot.

29:54.330 --> 29:55.330
"And we are one."

29:55.380 --> 29:59.060
She says, "Will we understand
each other when he's born?"

30:00.620 --> 30:02.330
"If he's like you,

30:02.380 --> 30:05.140
"I have no voice for him to hear."

30:07.300 --> 30:09.440
"And if he's like me...

30:10.260 --> 30:12.600
".. he'll live in silence."

30:13.900 --> 30:16.090
She says, "I need to hold him.

30:16.140 --> 30:18.490
"I want to look into his face,

30:18.540 --> 30:21.570
"because, until I do,

30:21.620 --> 30:23.810
"I won't know how to tell him

30:23.860 --> 30:25.730
"that he's loved."

30:32.060 --> 30:33.810
Oh, goodness me, Sister Monica Joan.

30:33.860 --> 30:36.130
You look like Mrs Hiawatha
all wrapped up like that.

30:36.180 --> 30:37.810
I would respond in verse,

30:37.860 --> 30:41.820
but my brain is too jellied to
recall the scantest couplet.

30:42.860 --> 30:45.410
And I doubt Minnehaha
would be obliged

30:45.460 --> 30:49.010
to secrete a bottle of hot
water underneath her scapula.

30:49.060 --> 30:50.450
It is frightfully nippy.

30:50.500 --> 30:52.490
I might get you a
vest after luncheon.

30:52.540 --> 30:54.450
The boiler has died.

30:54.500 --> 30:56.300
From inattention.

30:57.140 --> 30:59.730
I may yet suffer the same fate.

30:59.780 --> 31:01.690
Has Fred stopped coming altogether?

31:01.740 --> 31:05.690
He has not been seen since his
liaison with the haberdasher

31:05.740 --> 31:07.450
wilted on the vine.

31:07.500 --> 31:09.370
He must be distraught.

31:09.420 --> 31:10.410
SHE SCOFFS

31:10.460 --> 31:14.980
He would be more so if he could see
the tinge of blue upon my hands.

31:21.700 --> 31:24.210
I've come to take your
blood pressure, Maureen.

31:24.260 --> 31:25.610
What's happened to Neil?

31:25.660 --> 31:27.730
Did Nurse Gilbert take
him to the nursery?

31:27.780 --> 31:29.050
She did.

31:29.100 --> 31:32.380
And they agreed he could
stay until five o'clock.

31:33.420 --> 31:36.410
To give us time to make
arrangements with social services.

31:36.460 --> 31:38.330
Social services?

31:38.380 --> 31:39.370
Oh.

31:39.420 --> 31:44.130
Maureen, he needs to be looked
after while we take care of you.

31:44.180 --> 31:46.650
The foster mother we've
found for him is lovely.

31:46.700 --> 31:48.210
Foster mother?

31:48.260 --> 31:50.000
I'm his mother.

31:51.260 --> 31:54.580
He cries for his dad already, I
don't need him crying for me too.

31:56.460 --> 31:59.410
He can't do without me for
weeks and weeks. He can't.

31:59.460 --> 32:03.290
I promise you, children are
more resilient than you think.

32:03.340 --> 32:05.770
What does "resilient" mean?

32:05.820 --> 32:07.530
It means...

32:07.580 --> 32:09.220
strong.

32:10.500 --> 32:12.640
I wish I was resilient.

32:13.220 --> 32:15.930
Cos if I was, Neil
wouldn't have to be.

of everything I've told them
during cycling proficiency.

33:34.220 --> 33:36.770
What's the alternative? Me with
the mop across my shoulders

33:36.820 --> 33:39.330
and the buckets hanging from
each end of it, like a milkmaid?

33:39.380 --> 33:42.170
Why not? It'd be much safer
and you'd look quite fetching.

33:42.220 --> 33:44.360
Not as fetching as you.

33:44.660 --> 33:46.490
Go on, I'll take the bike.

33:46.540 --> 33:48.450
You can see to the
brushes and buckets.

33:48.500 --> 33:51.130
~ But it's my work bike
and there's a knack to it.
~ Oh, go on!

33:51.180 --> 33:52.490
I need the practice anyway.

33:52.540 --> 33:54.610
I'll need a bike of my own
once we're in the flat.

33:54.660 --> 33:57.020
~ BELL RINGS
~ Ooh! Gangway!

34:02.940 --> 34:04.930
~ Ooh!
~ SHE LAUGHS

34:04.980 --> 34:06.300
Sorry!

34:13.980 --> 34:16.120
Ding-dong, Avon calling.

34:17.860 --> 34:20.090
Don't you flamin' well start.

34:20.139 --> 34:21.130
Sorry.

34:21.179 --> 34:23.610
I have an uncanny knack
for misplaced jollity.

34:23.659 --> 34:26.130
Feel free to shy a plimsoll at me.

34:26.179 --> 34:27.929
I called in at the corner shop.

34:27.980 --> 34:32.380
They said you hadn't picked up
the Sporting Life since Monday.

34:33.460 --> 34:36.290
I shouldn't be entertaining
you in my vest.

34:36.340 --> 34:38.530
We've all got our vests
on in Nonnatus.

34:38.580 --> 34:40.650
Some of us are wearing two.

34:40.699 --> 34:42.130
The boiler broken?

34:42.179 --> 34:45.210
Yes, because no-one's come
to see to it for days.

34:45.260 --> 34:47.929
And the chimney's choked with soot.

34:48.900 --> 34:53.000
You know, the fella before me
warned me about that boiler.

34:53.780 --> 34:55.370
He said,

34:55.420 --> 34:57.930
"You'll have to sweet-talk
it every day.

34:57.980 --> 35:00.780
"It's like a bad-tempered woman."

35:01.940 --> 35:06.540
Those contraptions have been giving
me the runaround for 15 years.

35:08.900 --> 35:12.820
I never knew what he meant about
bad-tempered women until this week.

35:14.300 --> 35:17.210
Do you mean Violet or your daughter?

35:17.260 --> 35:19.730
Both.

35:19.780 --> 35:22.290
~ I thought Marlene was staying with you.
~ No.

35:22.340 --> 35:25.010
She's gone to stay with
her friend, Norah.

35:25.060 --> 35:27.570
Says she's fed up with
looking at my long face.

35:27.620 --> 35:29.420
Does she, indeed?

35:30.620 --> 35:32.810
Don't stop her coming round
every day to check to see

35:32.860 --> 35:35.260
if the flat's still standing.

35:35.620 --> 35:38.560
It's like she's fixated
with the place.

35:45.020 --> 35:49.210
Patrick. Is there nothing at all
that we can do for Maureen Gatsby?

35:49.260 --> 35:52.370
I've seen hyperemesis before,
but never like this.

35:52.420 --> 35:55.770
Is it cooked through when the mince
is bubbling through the potato?

35:55.820 --> 35:58.050
Looks slightly like volcanic lava.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.140
I'm sure it will taste
perfectly delicious.

36:03.540 --> 36:04.850
Really, Patrick.

36:04.900 --> 36:07.890
Of all the drugs salesmen
knocking on our door,

36:07.940 --> 36:11.180
hasn't there been one who's offered
some sort of anti-emetic?

36:12.940 --> 36:16.580
Yes, I think there was someone.
A month or two ago.

36:17.740 --> 36:20.540
I think we were busy with diphtheria.

36:21.220 --> 36:23.620
I will look it up in the log.

36:24.620 --> 36:26.810
HE GASPS

36:26.860 --> 36:29.730
Oh, I forgot to say
- it's really hot.

36:37.740 --> 36:41.130
I want yellow walls in here.
And china with a modern pattern.

36:41.180 --> 36:43.730
I don't want roses or violets on it.

36:43.780 --> 36:45.980
I want geometric designs.

36:46.820 --> 36:49.570
I want the only flowers
to be real flowers.

36:49.620 --> 36:51.850
Over there, on that windowsill,

36:51.900 --> 36:55.810
where they'll catch the light each
morning when the sun comes up.

36:55.860 --> 36:58.810
We'll have to find something
better than that ghastly jug.

36:58.860 --> 37:00.050
Oh, I like it.

37:00.100 --> 37:04.650
It's as though somebody left
it for us, like a little gift.

37:04.700 --> 37:07.700
And I want to smell
coffee when I wake up.

37:08.380 --> 37:11.690
And bleach, because that
will mean you're here.

37:11.740 --> 37:13.610
Or that you've just gone out.

37:13.660 --> 37:17.170
And when you come back
in, I can say...

37:17.220 --> 37:18.960
"Welcome home."

37:29.460 --> 37:31.260
Ah, this is it.

37:33.100 --> 37:35.170
Has to be worth a try.

37:40.060 --> 37:42.850
~ Shall I take the keys
and get a set cut for you?
~ Yes.

37:42.900 --> 37:46.370
~ I'd come with you, but I'll
be late on duty if I don't fly.
~ Gosh, yes.

37:46.420 --> 37:49.900
~ It's 20 to.
~ 20 to? I thought it was about quarter past.

37:50.900 --> 37:54.370
~ Oh, I must have got water in my watch.
~ Take my bike.

37:54.420 --> 37:57.370
~ Are you sure?
~ Park it outside the nurses' home.

37:57.420 --> 38:00.900
I'll fetch it before my shift
tonight. No-one will ever know.

38:02.020 --> 38:04.890
Take this as well. I don't
want you catching cold.

38:04.940 --> 38:07.610
You really are a sort of angel.

38:07.660 --> 38:11.260
The tragedy is, no-one will
ever know that either.

38:29.860 --> 38:31.980
TYRES SQUEAL Agh!

39:17.300 --> 39:20.170
Good afternoon. I'm enquiring
about a Miss Delia Busby.

39:20.220 --> 39:23.970
We believe she may have been brought
to you following a cycling accident.

39:24.020 --> 39:26.890
'Of course. Please hold.'

39:26.940 --> 39:29.340
Such a nice young woman, too.

39:29.700 --> 39:32.730
Her mother and father will
be beside themselves.

39:32.780 --> 39:35.320
They live miles away. In Wales.

39:36.620 --> 39:39.020
~ Hello?
~ 'Are you a relative?'

39:40.140 --> 39:41.570
No, I'm a friend.

39:41.620 --> 39:45.100
'Information can only be given
to the patient's next of kin.'

39:47.620 --> 39:49.780
Of course. Thank you.

39:55.300 --> 39:57.610
~ Any news?
~ No.

39:57.660 --> 40:01.290
Would you like me to run
you to the London in my car?

40:01.340 --> 40:04.090
They're only letting her
see her nearest and dearest.

40:04.140 --> 40:06.740
You know what the rules are like.

40:16.620 --> 40:19.210
~ Sugar?
~ No, thank you.

40:19.260 --> 40:22.410
Like my pa always says,
I'm sweet enough.

40:22.460 --> 40:25.770
And I don't know why you've
come round interfering.

40:25.820 --> 40:28.860
Because I know what it's like
to find oneself in a jam.

40:30.580 --> 40:33.680
How hard it is to say
the things one should.

40:34.980 --> 40:36.580
Or wishes to.

40:38.100 --> 40:40.850
This is our family home, Dad.

40:40.900 --> 40:43.100
This is where we grew up.

40:43.300 --> 40:44.770
Marlene...

40:46.100 --> 40:48.730
.. we didn't move in here until
I was demobbed in 1946.

40:48.780 --> 40:51.090
Your mother never even lived here.

40:51.140 --> 40:55.610
~ It was just you, me, Dolly
and that terrier we had.
~ I know.

40:55.660 --> 40:58.410
But this is where we
came together again,

40:58.460 --> 41:00.770
where we put the Blitz behind us.

41:00.820 --> 41:04.690
And for that very reason,
Mum was everywhere.

41:04.740 --> 41:07.170
How could she be, Marlene?

41:07.220 --> 41:10.220
We lost everything when
that bomb dropped.

41:13.340 --> 41:15.610
I went back to the bombsite,

41:15.660 --> 41:18.610
with my Auntie Peg after the funeral.

41:18.660 --> 41:20.600
I made her take me.

41:22.340 --> 41:26.370
I thought there'd be stuff
lying round in the rubble.

41:26.420 --> 41:28.530
Like souvenirs.

41:28.580 --> 41:31.050
It had already been bulldozed.

41:34.300 --> 41:35.450
Every time I come home,

41:35.500 --> 41:38.800
there's another gap where
something used to be.

41:40.940 --> 41:42.940
Ain't that the truth.

41:44.100 --> 41:47.100
Sometimes I think it's only
the river that stays the same.

42:11.940 --> 42:14.090
Can I help you, dear?

42:14.140 --> 42:17.140
~ Are you Delia's mother?
~ Yes, I am.

42:18.620 --> 42:22.130
I was hoping to see her. I'm Patsy.

42:22.180 --> 42:25.450
Patsy? Oh, of course.

42:25.500 --> 42:28.540
You're the lady she helps at Cubs.

42:29.540 --> 42:31.770
I had to ring for the nurse.

42:31.820 --> 42:33.930
She has these...

42:33.980 --> 42:37.080
spells - seizures, the
doctors call them...

42:37.660 --> 42:40.600
.. on account of the
knock to her head.

42:50.500 --> 42:52.090
Oh.

42:52.140 --> 42:56.050
~ Hello, Marlene.
~ I'm not going to ask you
to be nice to me, Violet.

42:56.100 --> 42:59.490
I was selfish and I was in the wrong.

42:59.540 --> 43:03.130
You could fill a whole page of your
ledger adding up the wrongs I done.

43:03.180 --> 43:06.130
I don't think we've got
anything to discuss.

43:06.180 --> 43:08.780
I'd like you to talk to my dad.

43:09.900 --> 43:12.010
Because my mum would tan my hide

43:12.060 --> 43:15.160
if she knew I tried to
stop him being happy.

43:29.380 --> 43:33.180
I believe in the films they
say, "Your place or mine?"

43:34.860 --> 43:37.290
I'd live in a ditch
if it was with you.

43:37.340 --> 43:39.080
Correct answer.

43:46.060 --> 43:49.330
There's still some dirt from the
road around your fingernails.

43:49.380 --> 43:51.850
It's by that little graze.

43:51.900 --> 43:54.490
When they next give you
a bedbath, just get them

43:54.540 --> 43:57.810
to rub it away with the
corner of the flannel.

43:57.860 --> 44:00.810
A spot of antiseptic
wouldn't go amiss.

44:00.860 --> 44:03.260
You sound a bit like a nurse.

44:04.940 --> 44:06.500
Do I?

44:07.860 --> 44:09.890
Are you a friend of mine?

44:09.940 --> 44:12.290
Yes.

44:12.340 --> 44:14.700
Have we been friends long?

44:15.900 --> 44:18.410
A little while.

44:18.460 --> 44:20.060
That's nice.

44:23.380 --> 44:25.780
Have you got lots of friends?

44:28.540 --> 44:29.780
No.

44:34.460 --> 44:36.730
Are you a nurse?

44:36.780 --> 44:38.420
No, cariad.

44:41.460 --> 44:43.610
I'm your mum.

44:43.660 --> 44:45.260
Oh.

44:47.740 --> 44:50.290
Can you help this girl?

44:50.340 --> 44:52.410
This is Patsy, cariad.

44:53.940 --> 44:55.890
What's the matter?

44:55.940 --> 44:58.140
She says she's my friend.

44:59.780 --> 45:01.920
And it's making her cry.

45:05.460 --> 45:09.610
The adverts make all sorts of claims
for these paper handkerchiefs.

45:09.660 --> 45:12.290
But I don't think they'll
ever catch on.

45:12.340 --> 45:14.740
Tears just seem to melt them.

45:18.540 --> 45:20.340
PHONE RINGS

45:21.700 --> 45:24.300
Nonnatus House, midwife speaking.

45:27.140 --> 45:30.140
Will her memory come back?

45:32.500 --> 45:35.100
No-one will make us any promises.

45:36.900 --> 45:40.500
So we're having to settle for hope.

45:41.700 --> 45:43.770
She's dozing, and the moment.

45:43.820 --> 45:46.330
Her father's sitting
with her for a bit.

45:46.380 --> 45:49.320
He used to do that
when she was a baby.

45:49.780 --> 45:53.050
Sit there looking at
her while she slept.

45:53.100 --> 45:56.260
There will be a lot of that
when we get her home to Wales.

45:59.980 --> 46:02.450
Will the hospital let you do that?

46:02.500 --> 46:04.840
The specialist suggested it.

46:05.860 --> 46:08.970
She'll need looking after
all the hours God sends.

46:09.020 --> 46:11.330
For a while, at least.

46:11.380 --> 46:14.930
And we still don't know if the
seizures will be permanent.

46:14.980 --> 46:16.780
May I come visit?

46:18.780 --> 46:22.810
Delia always says Pembridge is
lovely when it's not raining.

46:22.860 --> 46:25.000
Let's see how she does.

46:26.900 --> 46:30.010
May I call, from time to time?

46:30.060 --> 46:33.060
We aren't on the telephone.
I dare say you can write.

46:41.820 --> 46:44.090
I know where these can go.

46:53.540 --> 46:55.090
That's right.

46:55.140 --> 46:58.090
That's right, sweetie, just rest.

46:58.140 --> 47:01.620
~ I keep forgetting that
talking to her won't help.
~ It helps me.

47:54.260 --> 47:56.610
Little pushes now, June.

47:56.660 --> 48:00.330
~ Little pushes.
~ Little pushes. Little pushes.
~ That's it!

48:00.380 --> 48:02.450
That's it! That's it.

48:02.500 --> 48:04.810
I love you. I love you, June Dillon.

48:04.860 --> 48:06.570
Success!

48:06.620 --> 48:08.290
Baby's head's born.

48:08.340 --> 48:11.260
The head's born.

48:16.940 --> 48:18.690
Baby's just turning.

48:18.740 --> 48:21.490
One last big push for me, June.

48:21.540 --> 48:24.080
That's it! That's it! Well done!

48:28.340 --> 48:30.490
It's a boy, June.

48:30.540 --> 48:32.290
It's a boy!

48:32.340 --> 48:35.810
BABY CRIES

48:35.860 --> 48:37.860
Oh, shh, little one.

48:41.740 --> 48:43.810
She wants him held up.

49:01.780 --> 49:03.850
She says, "I love you.

49:04.860 --> 49:07.200
"And your father loves you.

49:08.260 --> 49:11.250
"And if you never hear his voice,

49:11.300 --> 49:13.640
"or if I never hear yours...

49:16.460 --> 49:19.410
".. just know that we love you...

49:19.460 --> 49:22.000
"from the bottom of our hearts."

49:46.300 --> 49:50.650
~ Evening, Trixie.
~ Or should I say "good morning"?

49:50.700 --> 49:53.040
Sometimes I can hardly tell.

49:53.900 --> 49:55.640
You look tired.

49:56.860 --> 49:59.200
I've just delivered a baby.

49:59.780 --> 50:03.890
And I'm off to sit with a dying man.

50:03.940 --> 50:06.620
That's life, really. Isn't it?

50:09.260 --> 50:10.800
Must hurry.

51:22.460 --> 51:25.300
Is that the Samaritans?

51:28.580 --> 51:31.880
Is it all right to call
if I don't want to die?

51:32.380 --> 51:35.380
Because all I really want
is just to stop drinking.

51:39.260 --> 51:42.050
Thank you, but there's
someone with her now.

51:42.100 --> 51:44.640
And she's in a place of safety.

51:47.620 --> 51:49.890
You are not alone, Trixie.

51:51.140 --> 51:54.450
I promise you, you are not alone.

51:54.500 --> 51:57.050
If you say you'll start praying,

51:57.100 --> 52:00.610
I guarantee you now that
would not stop me crying.

52:00.660 --> 52:04.690
The world is full of healing,
Trixie, and people who care,

52:04.740 --> 52:07.280
and who'll help you to find it.

52:58.620 --> 53:01.610
I don't want to go overboard
on fold rolls.

53:01.660 --> 53:05.450
I've got a blind spot for
trimmings, being a haberdasher!

53:05.500 --> 53:08.210
You were frightfully disciplined
about the rickrack braid.

53:08.260 --> 53:10.850
And I'm bally certain, no-one
will begrudge a bride a rose.

53:10.900 --> 53:13.850
Well, Coco Chanel used to say that
in order to be elegant, before you

53:13.900 --> 53:17.170
leave the house you should take
off the last thing you put on.

53:17.220 --> 53:20.160
What if the last thing
was one's skirt?

53:23.220 --> 53:26.500
Oh, you're right, though,
Violet. This is too plain.

53:33.780 --> 53:34.810
Oh.

53:34.860 --> 53:37.530
Sky-blue, like your mother's eyes.

53:47.540 --> 53:49.930
Maureen, look who it is!

53:49.980 --> 53:52.580
~ My little man!
~ Go to your mummy.

54:00.980 --> 54:04.330
One as necessary. Just as
you've been taking them.

54:04.380 --> 54:07.010
I tell you what, every
woman in the family way's

54:07.060 --> 54:09.610
going to be banging your
doors down for these.

54:09.660 --> 54:11.890
What's that magic stuff
in them, again?

54:11.940 --> 54:14.010
Er, the tablets are
known as Distaval.

54:14.060 --> 54:16.370
The magic ingredient
is called thalidomide.

54:16.420 --> 54:20.250
Well, better get some more in.
I'm going to spread the word.

54:20.300 --> 54:21.770
Shall we?

54:36.100 --> 54:38.900
I am the daughter of a man who drank.

54:40.420 --> 54:43.720
I am the daughter of a
man who fought in a war.

54:45.020 --> 54:47.420
I heard him yelling at night.

54:48.860 --> 54:50.860
And I saw him crying.

54:56.740 --> 54:59.340
But I knew how to make him smile.

55:00.460 --> 55:02.930
I knew how to make him better.

55:06.900 --> 55:09.410
And there are only two
things that could do that.

55:09.460 --> 55:11.460
Me.

55:13.020 --> 55:15.780
And a bottle of Scotch.

55:16.820 --> 55:18.930
I became a nurse.

55:18.980 --> 55:20.650
And a midwife.

55:22.380 --> 55:23.980
I was needed.

55:28.660 --> 55:30.530
And I needed them.

55:31.220 --> 55:34.220
Because every time
I delivered a baby...

55:35.540 --> 55:39.380
.. I was right in the heart of a
happy family for one or two hours.

55:41.940 --> 55:45.540
No matter that I always
have to go home on my own.

55:51.740 --> 55:53.730
No matter that...

55:53.780 --> 55:57.130
the one thing that makes
me feel better...

55:57.180 --> 55:59.180
is a glass of Scotch.

56:00.220 --> 56:02.220
Or something like it.

56:03.700 --> 56:07.210
There are so many things like it.

56:07.260 --> 56:09.000
Looking back...

56:09.900 --> 56:13.600
.. it seems to me my father
was quite unadventurous.

56:19.100 --> 56:21.240
Do I have to say it now?

56:28.340 --> 56:31.250
My name is Beatrix.

56:31.300 --> 56:34.060
But people call me Trixie.

56:37.140 --> 56:39.210
And I am an alcoholic.

56:43.860 --> 56:46.370
'Sometimes it's hard to distinguish

56:46.420 --> 56:48.820
'between ends and beginnings.

56:50.220 --> 56:53.050
