WEBVTT

00:01.520 --> 00:03.476
Previouslyon Seal Team...Alan Cutter.

00:03.520 --> 00:07.047
Hey.He's the founder
of Xeon Tactical Security.

00:07.090 --> 00:08.819
CU'I'I'ER: What Steve found, we all found.

00:08.870 --> 00:10.826
Tracesof lanthanides, yes.

00:10.880 --> 00:14.520
But traces only.
That's the history of Xeon's

00:14.570 --> 00:16.834
failed exploration in this area.

00:16.880 --> 00:19.314
Steve went to him to talk
about these rare earth metals.

00:19.360 --> 00:21.089
A few days later,
Steve is dead.

00:21.150 --> 00:22.833
I just think
that there's

00:22.890 --> 00:24.232
something else that's
going on here.

00:24.280 --> 00:26.054
This is Abad Halani.

00:26.110 --> 00:28.101
My brother, Nouri Halani,

00:28.150 --> 00:30.106
blew up your commandos
some weeks ago.

00:30.160 --> 00:32.151
I want to deliver him to you.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.895
Abad says he can give us
Nouri Halani.

00:33.940 --> 00:36.408
_He's asked _
for an In-person meeting.

00:38.160 --> 00:40.333
My name is Abad Halani.

00:40.380 --> 00:42.075
I know who you are.Your commandos

00:42.120 --> 00:45.248
burned a poppy field belonging
to one of my brother's people.

00:45.300 --> 00:48.349
Now, let me tell you
how to kill him.

00:48.390 --> 00:50.346
MANDY:
Our friend Abad convinced

00:50.390 --> 00:53.268
his brother to make the visit
to the village of Ayub Kheyl.

00:53.310 --> 00:55.483
That's Taliban country.

00:55.530 --> 00:57.304
So if you guys get caught
on the ground...

00:57.360 --> 00:58.258
Then we better move fast.

00:59.790 --> 01:01.519
Jackpot.DAVIS: Bravo 1,

01:01.580 --> 01:02.740
confirming positive ID.
on Nouri Halani.

01:02.800 --> 01:04.142
How do you know
about Cutter?

01:04.190 --> 01:06.624
The Englishman.Yeah, the Englishman. Cutter.

01:17.380 --> 01:20.463
PILOT:
Flare! Flare!

01:26.210 --> 01:27.199
No!

01:40.440 --> 01:42.613
DAVIS: Bravo 1, this is TOC.
Do you copy?

01:42.660 --> 01:46.005
Say again, do you copy?

01:46.060 --> 01:47.186
Bravo 6, do you copy?

01:47.230 --> 01:48.709
ERIC: Call the
Quick Reaction Force,

01:48.760 --> 01:50.239
the Combat, Search
and Rescue birds

01:50.280 --> 01:51.838
on standby and
tell 'em to launch.

01:51.890 --> 01:53.585
Do you want to spin up
an extra medevac, too?

01:53.630 --> 01:56.417
Not till we know if the
operation IS rescue or recovery.

01:56.460 --> 01:58.587
Sorry.

01:58.640 --> 02:00.676
Shouldn't have trusted Abad.

02:00.720 --> 02:03.154
The idea that he would just
hand over his brother.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.155
We don't have time
for that right now.

02:05.210 --> 02:07.508
Besides, we were gonna go
after an HVT like Nouri Halani

02:07.560 --> 02:09.164
no matter what
call you made.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.518
Bravo 2, this is TOC.

02:10.560 --> 02:12.551
Have Avenger 2-6 move
to the crash site.

02:12.610 --> 02:14.168
RAY:
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

02:14.220 --> 02:16.165
We're already doubling
back. Five minutes out.

02:16.220 --> 02:18.256
ERIC: We don't know
what took 2-4 out.

02:18.310 --> 02:20.301
They went down hard.
Stay alert.

02:20.350 --> 02:21.601
RAY:
Roger that. We'll get to 'em.

02:21.660 --> 02:23.173
All right, boys,

02:23.230 --> 02:24.561
we're gonna secure a perimeter
at the crash site,

02:24.620 --> 02:26.178
exfil the injured, then wait

02:26.230 --> 02:29.222
for the Quick Reaction Force
to get the rest of us out. Copy?

02:29.270 --> 02:32.353
Heads on a swivel, boys.
Heads on a swivel!

02:40.370 --> 02:44.067
: Avenger 2-6,
this is Bravo 4, come in.

02:44.120 --> 02:49.023
I repeat: Avenger 2-6, this is
Bravo 4. Do you read me?

02:49.080 --> 02:52.117
TOC, this Bravo 4. Come in.

02:52.170 --> 02:55.389
Repeat: this is Bravo 4.
Come in.

02:55.430 --> 02:59.867
Avenger 2-6, this is Bravo 4.
Come in.

02:59.910 --> 03:02.299
TRENT: Clay,
I need a hand with Jason.

03:02.350 --> 03:05.262
Jason?!

03:05.310 --> 03:08.222
Jason

03:08.270 --> 03:10.318
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

03:10.360 --> 03:12.316
Jason, can...?
What's going on?!

03:12.360 --> 03:14.442
He got hit in the head
while we were spinnin' out.

03:14.490 --> 03:16.276
We got shot down, man.

03:16.320 --> 03:17.924
Hey! Jace?

03:19.930 --> 03:21.238
TRENT:
Hey, we lost the satcom.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.929
We got no comms with TOC.

03:22.980 --> 03:25.198
Hoping they got eyes on us.

03:27.420 --> 03:29.069
DAVIS: We got multiple survivors
down there.

03:29.120 --> 03:30.542
Get that medevac launched.

03:30.600 --> 03:32.556
Bravo 2, there are survivors.
How far out are you?

03:32.600 --> 03:35.501
Two minutes out!
Two minutes out!

03:35.560 --> 03:37.778
Okay, boys?
We got two mikes out!

03:37.820 --> 03:39.253
TRENT:
Pilot's dead.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.291
The co-pilot's in trouble.
We got to move him.

03:41.350 --> 03:43.215
CLAY: All right, this is
what we're gonna do, okay?

03:43.260 --> 03:44.511
We're gonna stabilize
the wounded here, okay?

03:44.570 --> 03:46.253
Then we're gonna push
to an L2 and wait

03:46.310 --> 03:48.005
for the QRF to get us
the hell out of here.

03:48.050 --> 03:50.746
That sound good, y'all?Good.

03:50.790 --> 03:53.258
Medders?
Hey, you all right?

03:53.320 --> 03:55.356
Yeah?
Yeah.

03:55.400 --> 03:56.958
Hey, you good?Yeah.

03:57.010 --> 03:58.443
I'm good. I'm good.You good?

03:58.490 --> 03:59.889
Hey, where's Nouri?

03:59.930 --> 04:01.886
He got tossed out
prior to impact.

04:01.930 --> 04:03.579
We didn't strap him down.

04:03.630 --> 04:05.450
It's fine. We got
bigger issues right now.

04:05.500 --> 04:06.842
We're sitting ducks out here.
T

04:06.890 --> 04:08.369
We're... we're gonna
set up a CCP.

04:08.420 --> 04:09.978
Trent, let's-let's
move Jason now.

04:10.030 --> 04:11.930
And then we'll come back and get
the rest of the wounded guys.

04:11.990 --> 04:13.469
You ready?
You good to walk?

04:13.510 --> 04:15.284
Yeah.You good to walk?
Let's go, brother. Come on.

04:15.340 --> 04:17.205
Hey. Hey.

04:17.250 --> 04:18.376
My leg.

04:18.430 --> 04:20.557
My leg's burning up.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.295
My leg's burning up.
Give me the morphine.

04:22.340 --> 04:23.773
Morphine.Here, here.
I got you. I got you.

04:23.820 --> 04:25.378
Come on!I got you!

04:38.100 --> 04:39.658
I'm gonna go clear this house
and make sure it's secure.

04:39.710 --> 04:41.223
Roger that.

04:41.280 --> 04:42.486
Medders, move your ass!

04:48.540 --> 04:50.496
Derek, cover me!

04:54.550 --> 04:55.892
Take cover!

04:57.420 --> 04:59.331
DAVIS:
Now who the hell are these guys?

04:59.380 --> 05:01.723
Nouri's men can't have
made It up there already
from the village.

05:01.770 --> 05:03.465
Neighborhood they went down
in is Taliban territory.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.329
We don't have a lot
of fans up there.

05:17.830 --> 05:19.388
They're in combat!

05:21.400 --> 05:22.355
Get us down now!

05:25.840 --> 05:27.535
RPG!

05:30.670 --> 05:32.103
I got you.We're taking fire!

05:32.150 --> 05:33.105
Damn it!

05:37.550 --> 05:39.598
Jace, stay down!

06:04.450 --> 06:06.611
You're gonna get yourself killed
doing this, come on.

06:07.710 --> 06:09.189
Trent!

06:09.230 --> 06:12.882
Trent!
Jason! Jason!

06:12.930 --> 06:14.750
Come on, brother, let's move.
Come on, brother.

06:14.800 --> 06:17.496
Go, go, go.
Go! Go! Derek!

06:17.550 --> 06:20.417
Get Medders.
Movmg!

06:33.690 --> 06:35.294
We're going back
for the others, okay?

06:35.350 --> 06:36.692
Yeah, go.

06:36.740 --> 06:38.514
Jason's down!
Put us In!

06:38.570 --> 06:39.787
Get us down now!

06:39.830 --> 06:42.219
We got a SAM lock.
We got to go.

06:42.270 --> 06:44.215
Our boys need us!
Put us down now!

06:44.270 --> 06:45.783
They'll have to
fend for themselves.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.353
We're out of here.

07:29.100 --> 07:30.613
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

07:30.660 --> 07:32.002
We just dropped down about
two klicks below the crash site.

07:32.060 --> 07:34.483
LZ was too hot.
We had a SAM lock onto us.

07:34.540 --> 07:36.485
Copy that. Haul ass
up that mountain.

07:36.540 --> 07:38.235
Those boys cannot
hold off forever.

07:38.280 --> 07:39.884
We're certain
that Jason's helo got taken out

07:39.930 --> 07:41.409
by a surface

07:41.460 --> 07:43.678
Seems like an awful lot
of firepower for local Taliban.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.676
Probably looking at
a Russian SA-7.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.506
Older, still one
of the most lethal

07:47.550 --> 07:49.586
air defense systems
in the world.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.335
Got a two-mile range,
deadly accuracy.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.280
What the hell are they
doing with that up there?

07:53.340 --> 07:55.422
It's a miracle that anybody's
walking away from that crash.

07:55.470 --> 07:57.426
It's a miracle that is not
likely to happen again.

07:57.470 --> 07:59.938
We are not sending
any more helos into that area.

08:00.000 --> 08:02.605
You're calling off the QRF?

08:02.650 --> 08:05.255
We have survivors under fire.

08:05.310 --> 08:07.733
Helos don't have a shot against
heat-seeking missiles.

08:07.790 --> 08:10.429
We'd be sending 20 men
into a suicide mission.

08:10.490 --> 08:12.697
We can't just leave them there.

08:12.750 --> 08:14.786
QRF, this is TOC.
Be advised that...

08:14.840 --> 08:16.489
...there_ are_ _
surface-to-alr mIssHes

08:16.530 --> 08:18.134
in the vicinity
of the crash site.

08:18.190 --> 08:20.317
Need you to take up a loiter
pattern four klicks out

08:20.360 --> 08:22.794
and hold that pattern until
we can cool off the L2.

08:22.850 --> 08:24.499
PILOT: Copy, TOC.
Moving to loiter pattern now.

08:24.540 --> 08:25.939
Davis, I need you

08:25.980 --> 08:27.322
to find out where that
missile was shot from.

08:27.370 --> 08:29.235
Until we can eradicate
the SAMs as a threat,

08:29.290 --> 08:31.190
our boys are all alone
up there on that mountain.

08:33.420 --> 08:36.412
Candy-ass pilot should have
dropped us off at the L2.

08:36.470 --> 08:38.244
Candy-ass pilot
saved our lives.

08:38.300 --> 08:40.552
Every Talimonster in
the region's gonna want a piece

08:40.600 --> 08:42.556
of that bird,
and we're down here.

08:42.600 --> 08:44.477
What good would we
be to Jason and Clay

08:44.520 --> 08:46.215
blown to pieces all
over the mountain?

08:46.260 --> 08:48.956
Our boys are still under attack!

08:49.000 --> 08:51.434
And still putting up one
hell of a fight. Let's go!

09:00.400 --> 09:03.528
I'm good.

09:03.580 --> 09:05.536
I'm good.Go, go.

09:12.980 --> 09:14.629
Jason, you okay?

09:22.770 --> 09:24.590
All right, how are we
with air support?

09:24.650 --> 09:26.948
MANDY: We can't launch any close
air support because of the SAMs.

09:27.000 --> 09:29.685
Spectre gunships won't
operate in daylight.

09:29.740 --> 09:32.561
The best I can find is
an unmanned reaper drone.

09:32.610 --> 09:34.737
How far is it?40 minutes at least.

09:40.750 --> 09:42.615
Ready? Let's go.

09:46.450 --> 09:48.145
TRENT: Okay, wounded are
all secure in the house.

09:48.190 --> 09:49.794
Sounds like we're starting
to push 'em back a little bit.

09:53.020 --> 09:55.625
You were saying?

09:56.630 --> 09:57.972
Let's go.

10:10.080 --> 10:12.128
Got him! Got him!

10:17.700 --> 10:20.396
I've got two fighters retreating
over the hill into dead space!

10:20.440 --> 10:23.000
All right, we're gonna
Alamo up! Let's go!Roger that!

10:24.530 --> 10:26.578
All right, so it looks like
Ray's helo

10:26.620 --> 10:28.315
couldn't touch down near us,
okay, so we're gonna have to

10:28.360 --> 10:29.964
wait for the boys
to come get us.

10:30.020 --> 10:32.409
We're gonna hold out till then.
Hey, how y'all doing on ammo?

10:32.450 --> 10:33.667
I got three mags left.

10:33.720 --> 10:36.666
Down to my last mag,
then I'm Winchester.

10:37.500 --> 10:39.582
CLAY:
Okay. All right.

10:39.630 --> 10:42.758
Let's get some ammo and weapons
off the wounded, all right?

10:42.810 --> 10:45.540
Hey. Hey, that Huey's got
that M240 on board, right?

10:45.600 --> 10:47.636
Yeah.
Okay.
We're gonna...

10:47.690 --> 10:49.726
we're gonna use that
to fortify our position here.

10:49.770 --> 10:51.203
You take care
of the wounded guys.

10:51.250 --> 10:52.512
We're gonna go resupply,
all right?

10:52.560 --> 10:53.777
Okay, grab the aid bag
while you're at it.

10:53.820 --> 10:57.608
Check.
JASON:
TOC, TOC, this is 1.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.641
TOC, this is 1.
We got eyes on Nouri?

10:59.700 --> 11:02.567
TOC, this is 1.
Do we have any eyes on Nouri?

11:02.610 --> 11:04.305
Jason knows TOC
can't hear us, right?

11:04.350 --> 11:06.306
Yeah, the concussion's
got him a little loopy.

11:06.360 --> 11:09.488
JASON: TOC...We have to cut
the guy some slack.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.572
We got some eyes on Nouri?

11:14.630 --> 11:17.315
Anyone got eyes on Nouri?

11:17.370 --> 11:19.270
TOC. TOC.

11:25.770 --> 11:29.331
It's Medders, right?
Medders.

11:29.380 --> 11:32.338
Yeah, that's right.

11:32.380 --> 11:35.429
You got a first name?

11:35.470 --> 11:37.995
Yeah. I mean,
of course.
Of course.

11:38.040 --> 11:41.123
Are you gonna
tell me what it is?

11:41.170 --> 11:44.606
Yeah, sorry.
It's, uh, Dave.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.911
Dave.

11:45.960 --> 11:47.951
Yeah, Dave.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.917
Dave.Yeah.

11:52.970 --> 11:55.438
That's my dad's name.

11:55.490 --> 11:57.219
That's my dad's name.

11:57.280 --> 11:58.531
Dave Hayes?

11:58.580 --> 12:01.538
Yeah.

12:01.590 --> 12:05.105
Wait.

12:05.150 --> 12:06.674
Wait a second.

12:06.720 --> 12:08.676
Wait, have we met before?

12:08.720 --> 12:10.722
About ten seconds ago.

12:10.770 --> 12:13.238
Yeah, you're Jason Hayes.

12:13.290 --> 12:17.249
I'm Jason Hayes.

12:17.300 --> 12:18.904
Hey.

12:18.950 --> 12:20.736
Look, you ever been shot?

12:20.780 --> 12:24.250
To be honest, it's my first
time even getting shot at. Yeah.

12:24.300 --> 12:26.256
Four years in the Corps,
I never once got

12:26.310 --> 12:28.346
to step outside the wire.

12:29.400 --> 12:31.914
You ever get
used to this?

12:31.960 --> 12:34.520
Which part?

12:35.530 --> 12:37.009
I don't know.

12:37.060 --> 12:38.539
Getting shot at?

12:38.580 --> 12:41.447
Getting shot?

12:41.490 --> 12:44.015
Getting shot at,

12:44.060 --> 12:47.757
well, you get used to that.

12:49.110 --> 12:51.578
Getting shot pretty much sucks.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.850
It sucks.Yeah, well,

12:55.900 --> 12:58.812
hurts less than I
thought it would.Yeah.

12:58.860 --> 13:00.418
Maybe that's 'cause
of the morphine.

13:02.390 --> 13:07.259
It's crazy how the pain just
kind of, like, eases up, right?

13:11.440 --> 13:13.396
Dave?

13:13.440 --> 13:15.692
Yeah.Dave.

13:15.750 --> 13:17.968
Hey. Yo.

13:18.010 --> 13:21.616
I'm really sorry
we got you into this.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.615
I really am.

13:23.670 --> 13:27.015
I told you, I was looking
for a way into the fight.

13:27.060 --> 13:28.584
Yeah.

13:28.630 --> 13:31.622
Well, it looks
like you found a way in.

13:31.680 --> 13:34.410
MANDY:
Okay, this isn't good.

13:34.460 --> 13:35.631
We're getting
signal intelligence.

13:35.680 --> 13:37.636
We have armed men on the way
from the village

13:37.680 --> 13:40.376
to our crash site.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.468
That terrain,
we're talking 30 minutes tops

13:42.510 --> 13:44.944
till they get to our guys.All right, I'm gonna try
to find them on the ISR.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.685
How many guys are
we talking about?
Unclear.

13:46.730 --> 13:48.379
Everyone in that village
is a Halani

13:48.430 --> 13:50.034
or a cousin of a Halani.

13:50.090 --> 13:52.081
They're not going up there
to help our guys.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.825
And we've got no way
to warn 'em.

13:53.870 --> 13:55.826
RAY:
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.519
How close are_ we
to the crash srte?

13:57.570 --> 14:00.175
Bravo 2, estimate you're
less than ten minutes out.

14:00.230 --> 14:02.619
But be advised, you may have
a large group of fighters

14:02.660 --> 14:03.786
heading up to the crash site

14:03.840 --> 14:04.738
from the other side
of the mountain.

14:04.800 --> 14:06.791
May have?

14:06.840 --> 14:08.273
DAVIS:
ISR hasn't picked 'em up yet.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.754
We'll let you know as soon
as we've got a visual.

14:10.800 --> 14:13.234
Should we deviate from course?
Cut 'em off?

14:15.370 --> 14:17.281
Negative. Make your way
up to that farmhouse

14:17.330 --> 14:19.378
and help 'em hold till
we locate the SAMs.

14:19.420 --> 14:21.285
We need to get our helos
in there.

14:21.330 --> 14:22.809
Yeah. Roger that.

14:22.860 --> 14:25.897
I hope we see
Halani's boys again.

14:25.950 --> 14:27.759
Got some unfinished business
for 'em.

14:29.780 --> 14:31.077
Down, down, down, down!Down, down, down!

14:31.130 --> 14:32.552
SONNY:
Get your asses down!

14:32.610 --> 14:34.737
Get your asses on the ground!

14:34.780 --> 14:38.045
SONNY: Watch the hands!
Watch the hands!

14:44.400 --> 14:45.617
We don't got time for this.
We gotta get to the crash site.

14:45.660 --> 14:47.969
These are Tali scouts
for sure.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.051
That's a hunting rifle.Yeah, and we're their prey.

14:53.100 --> 14:55.921
So let's take care
of 'em and move on.Take care of 'em?

14:55.980 --> 14:57.789
We let 'em go,
they'll start squawking,

14:57.850 --> 14:59.806
and the entire mountain's
gonna know what our path IS.

14:59.850 --> 15:03.149
It'll be Operation Red Wing
all over again.

15:03.200 --> 15:06.852
Tell you what, there's
one less rifle in this war.

15:06.900 --> 15:09.892
This rifle is probably all
these kids have in the world.

15:09.950 --> 15:11.201
Are you kidding me right now?

15:11.250 --> 15:14.208
You did not just do that.Yes, I did.

15:14.260 --> 15:16.558
Like you said, we don't
have time for this-- let's go!

15:16.610 --> 15:18.862
Golden Horde's charging
our men right now

15:18.910 --> 15:20.218
while we're sitting here
playing grab-ass

15:20.260 --> 15:22.649
with Future Taliban
of Afghanistan Club!

15:22.700 --> 15:23.826
That's great, Ray.

15:26.570 --> 15:28.265
Stop!

15:29.450 --> 15:30.838
SONNY:
Shoot him!

15:30.880 --> 15:31.869
Let him go, let him go.

15:33.230 --> 15:35.960
What the hell was that, Ray?Good judgment.

15:36.020 --> 15:37.885
That kid's not a threat, and
we don't have time to chase him.

15:37.930 --> 15:39.147
CID may have cleared you

15:39.190 --> 15:40.976
for killing that kid
with the grenade,

15:41.020 --> 15:42.328
but you're still
in your head, Ray.

15:42.370 --> 15:44.975
You've gone trigger-shy.Wrong.

15:45.030 --> 15:46.452
You've got revenge
in your head,

15:46.510 --> 15:47.932
and it's clouding
your thinking.

15:47.990 --> 15:49.981
Smoking that goat herder
isn't gonna do anything

15:50.030 --> 15:52.555
for anybody at that crash site.
Now, I made the right call.

15:52.600 --> 15:54.682
If it was the wrong call, we're
gonna be too dead to realize it.

15:54.730 --> 15:58.552
You... are emotional.

15:58.600 --> 16:01.125
It was the right call.
Let's go!

16:03.740 --> 16:04.911
I am not emotional!

16:10.270 --> 16:13.262
Hey.

16:15.490 --> 16:18.402
Looks like we're gonna have
some visitors pretty soon.

16:21.060 --> 16:24.018
Yeah, no worries, huh?

16:24.070 --> 16:26.061
We can take 'em.
Right?

16:26.110 --> 16:27.805
I like your attitude.

16:27.850 --> 16:29.806
You got a good attitude.

16:29.850 --> 16:31.283
Hey...

16:31.330 --> 16:33.981
you got any family back home?

16:34.030 --> 16:36.112
A wife or kids waiting on you?

16:38.560 --> 16:39.982
Got a girlfriend.

16:40.040 --> 16:42.031
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:42.950 --> 16:44.679
Is it serious?

16:44.740 --> 16:47.254
I'm gonna ask her
to marry me.

16:47.310 --> 16:49.778
Yeah, you know,
high school sweethearts.

16:49.830 --> 16:50.785
You know the story.

16:50.830 --> 16:53.526
Yeah, yeah, I've heard it.

16:53.570 --> 16:55.913
Yeah, she's tough.Yeah.

16:55.970 --> 16:59.053
Yeah, my girl,
she's really tough.

16:59.100 --> 17:03.139
This one time, we were
in a quarry near school,

17:03.190 --> 17:05.442
and I wanted to impress her
or something, and I tried

17:05.500 --> 17:07.718
to do this, like,
triple flip thing,

17:07.760 --> 17:12.060
and I crashed a belly
slam from 35 feet,

17:12.110 --> 17:15.113
and it knocked
me right out.

17:15.160 --> 17:18.505
Next thing I know, I'm
headed for the bottom.

17:18.550 --> 17:20.245
Next thing after that,
Alana's right there,

17:20.300 --> 17:22.291
and she's helping me up.

17:22.340 --> 17:24.296
What did you say her name was,
your girlfriend?

17:24.340 --> 17:27.070
Anna. Her name's Anna.

17:27.130 --> 17:28.472
What did you think I said?

17:28.520 --> 17:30.647
I don't know. Go ahead.

17:32.090 --> 17:35.696
Anyway, I'm coughing
and I'm choking on water,

17:35.750 --> 17:38.526
and I look over,
and she's...

17:38.570 --> 17:41.004
she's grinning.

17:41.060 --> 17:44.530
You know, I...
knew right there

17:44.580 --> 17:46.138
she was gonna be my wife.

17:50.060 --> 17:52.585
What about you,
are you married?

17:54.940 --> 17:57.841
Yeah.

17:57.900 --> 18:00.027
I was.

18:00.070 --> 18:03.198
We got two kids.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.037
You got kids?
Yeah.

18:06.080 --> 18:08.298
Yeah, I want kids.
You do?

18:08.340 --> 18:10.729
Yeah. I come from
a big family.

18:10.780 --> 18:12.554
Three boys, two girls.
Mm.

18:12.610 --> 18:15.124
I wouldn't mind an even
half dozen myself.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.357
What are you doing here?

18:21.400 --> 18:23.652
What do you mean?

18:23.710 --> 18:27.055
Go back to sleep, will you?

18:31.630 --> 18:33.495
Go back to sleep.

18:47.210 --> 18:49.553
Ray's almost to the farmhouse.

18:49.600 --> 18:52.160
Gives me some relief knowing
they'll all be together soon.

18:52.210 --> 18:54.075
We're not out of the woods yet.
Still can't get to them

18:54.130 --> 18:56.166
till we clear a path
for the QRF.

18:56.220 --> 18:57.517
RAY:
TOC, this is Bravo 2.

18:57.570 --> 18:59.049
We're getting close
to the crash site.

18:59.090 --> 19:01.138
You got eyes on any enemy
in the area?

19:01.180 --> 19:03.648
You're clear for now,
Bravo 2.

19:03.700 --> 19:05.520
Have you established comms
with the other guys yet?

19:07.320 --> 19:11.006
Negative. Hopefully we will
when we get line of sight.

19:11.060 --> 19:14.052
Come on, boys, just
over this ridge. Go! Go!

19:26.730 --> 19:27.765
Let's go.

19:47.140 --> 19:49.131
Wow.

19:49.180 --> 19:52.183
It's amazing anybody
walked away from this.

19:57.320 --> 19:59.231
Any Bravo element,
this is 2.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.975
Comms check, over.

20:06.240 --> 20:08.982
CLAY:
About time.

20:09.030 --> 20:11.373
Copy that, Bravo 6.There we go.

20:12.470 --> 20:13.858
Let's go get our boys.

20:13.900 --> 20:15.333
Let's move.

20:15.380 --> 20:17.166
RAY: Coming to you.
Do not fire to the west.

20:17.210 --> 20:19.121
Say again, do not fire
to the west.

20:25.870 --> 20:27.349
Hey, brother.What's up, boys?

20:27.400 --> 20:29.743
Like what you've done
with the place.

20:29.790 --> 20:30.870
It reminds me
of Pottery Barn.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.091
What's going on?

20:32.140 --> 20:33.391
Blown out wall's
a nice touch.

20:33.440 --> 20:34.657
Well, now she doesn't
look like much,

20:34.710 --> 20:36.268
but she's worked
this far, huh?

20:36.320 --> 20:38.220
You good?I'm good.

20:38.280 --> 20:40.089
Want to bring us up to speed?

20:40.150 --> 20:43.404
We took five casualties between
the ambush and the crash.

20:43.450 --> 20:45.099
Any KIA?

20:45.150 --> 20:46.708
Yeah.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.359
And Jason?

20:49.420 --> 20:51.980
Jason took a hard hit.

20:52.030 --> 20:53.190
How hard?

20:53.250 --> 20:54.376
JASON:
Not hard enough.

20:57.900 --> 21:00.425
Hey.

21:00.470 --> 21:02.256
Took you long enough.Ran a mile uphill

21:02.300 --> 21:04.200
to get to your ass and
that's the welcome we get?

21:04.260 --> 21:06.160
What's the status
on the QRF?

21:06.220 --> 21:09.087
Circling.

21:09.130 --> 21:10.438
No one's coming for us
until we clear

21:10.480 --> 21:11.913
the mountain of those SAMs
that took you guys out.

21:11.960 --> 21:13.871
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

21:13.920 --> 21:16.912
We can't exfil on your bird?

21:16.970 --> 21:20.315
Huh?Like I said, the area's too hot
right now to land.

21:20.360 --> 21:22.089
Boss, you sure you're okay?

21:22.150 --> 21:25.233
Yeah. What is the status
of the QRF?

21:27.020 --> 21:30.274
MANDY:
Bravo 2, this is TOC.

21:30.330 --> 21:31.888
Go for 2.

21:31.940 --> 21:33.362
I hate to break up the reunion,

21:33.420 --> 21:35.240
but we finally found
those fighters.

21:35.290 --> 21:37.929
Nouri's men are closing in
on you fast.

21:39.950 --> 21:41.338
Copy, TOC.

21:51.390 --> 21:53.346
Okay, boys, according to TOC,
this is the situation.

21:53.390 --> 21:57.269
This is us.

21:57.310 --> 21:58.652
ISR shows a force of about 20

21:58.700 --> 22:00.611
to 25 combatants heading
from the southwest.

22:00.660 --> 22:02.616
A bunch more Nouri guys.Got to assume
they've been tipped

22:02.660 --> 22:04.924
to the location of the helo.

22:04.970 --> 22:06.619
That's how it looks.

22:06.670 --> 22:07.659
They originally massed
at AK village

22:07.710 --> 22:09.666
after our assault
on his compound.

22:09.710 --> 22:12.019
Mandy's guess puts them
15 minutes out.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.140
Bring it on.

22:13.200 --> 22:15.100
How we looking for ammo?

22:15.150 --> 22:16.845
Looking about three
cans for the 240,

22:16.900 --> 22:18.549
what we all got on us,

22:18.590 --> 22:20.114
plus we got an
additional 15 mags

22:20.160 --> 22:21.411
from the go bag
on the bird.

22:21.470 --> 22:23.722
We got some pirate guns
and a couple Claymores.

22:23.770 --> 22:27.069
Yes, sir. Also got that
satchel charge off the helo.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.862
And I figure, we got,
what, another dozen or so

22:29.910 --> 22:31.775
frag grenades between us?

22:31.820 --> 22:33.515
Depending on how
well equipped they are,

22:33.560 --> 22:35.118
what type of casualties
they're willing to take,

22:35.170 --> 22:37.388
we can hold them off
say 45 minutes?

22:37.440 --> 22:39.396
I'll prep the 240.

22:39.440 --> 22:41.522
Hell yeah. That'll keep
the enemy at distance.

22:41.570 --> 22:42.787
Don't want our helos landing

22:42.830 --> 22:44.138
in the middle
of a bullet circus.

22:44.180 --> 22:45.579
CLAY:
Yeah, look,

22:45.620 --> 22:46.655
we're not getting
any helos in here

22:46.710 --> 22:47.745
unless we take out the SAMs.

22:52.150 --> 22:54.106
TOC.

22:54.150 --> 22:55.538
This is Bravo 2.

22:55.590 --> 22:56.625
We got a 20
on where those missiles

22:56.670 --> 22:57.887
are coming from yet?Confirm.

22:57.940 --> 22:58.929
Mandy's gonna be having
something for you

22:58.980 --> 23:00.026
in a few minutes.

23:00.070 --> 23:02.026
How's he doing?

23:02.070 --> 23:05.506
He's a little woozy but luckily,
the guy's got a hard head.

23:06.860 --> 23:08.816
Uh, who, Jason?

23:08.860 --> 23:09.940
Look, you take care of him.

23:09.990 --> 23:12.254
Copy.
MANDY:
Okay, here we go.

23:12.300 --> 23:14.165
Hold on, hold on,
Bravo 2.

23:14.210 --> 23:16.212
So_ it turns out that
the UniverSIty of Vancouver

23:16.260 --> 23:17.693
is doing a global study

23:17.740 --> 23:19.958
on atmospheric
temperature fluctuations.

23:20.000 --> 23:21.865
DAVIS:
Which we care about why?

23:21.920 --> 23:23.694
As part of the study,
our Canadian friends

23:23.750 --> 23:26.696
were collecting fairly
continuous satellite imagery

23:26.750 --> 23:28.786
from Khost Province
in Afghanistan.

23:28.840 --> 23:30.091
DAVIS:
Thermal imagery?

23:30.140 --> 23:31.664
Have a look.

23:33.100 --> 23:35.273
Hey, Perry, we got 'em.

23:35.320 --> 23:36.708
Tell me you found

23:36.760 --> 23:38.239
the heat signature
of that missile launch.

23:38.280 --> 23:40.328
We found the heat signature
from the missile launch.

23:40.370 --> 23:42.235
It looks like it's coming
from a gully about 750 yards

23:42.290 --> 23:45.191
due north of you, which is why
our drone didn't pick it up.

23:47.160 --> 23:48.718
Copy that. Great job, guys.

23:48.770 --> 23:51.728
Bravo 2, you're gonna
need to hustle.

23:51.770 --> 23:53.681
We're looking at bad guys
six minutes out.

23:53.730 --> 23:55.209
Copy that.

23:55.250 --> 23:57.070
Okay, boys, we found the
location of the SAM site.

23:57.130 --> 23:58.427
All right. Yeah?Clay.

23:58.480 --> 23:59.777
You and Sonny
want to take Brock,

23:59.820 --> 24:00.821
Full Metal, head on
over there, show them

24:00.870 --> 24:01.950
what happens
when they mess with us?

24:02.000 --> 24:03.820
Frog's ass watertight?

24:03.870 --> 24:04.859
Yeah, man.Let's get it, baby. Hey.

24:04.920 --> 24:06.171
Keep hammering.

24:06.220 --> 24:07.391
Hey, Sonny.

24:07.440 --> 24:09.396
Yeah?

24:09.440 --> 24:10.520
Give 'em hell,
all right, brother?

24:10.570 --> 24:11.571
I want to go home.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.440
Roger that.

24:15.840 --> 24:17.398
Hey, boss.

24:17.450 --> 24:19.145
How's the head feeling?

24:21.930 --> 24:24.364
Boss?

24:24.410 --> 24:27.413
Hey, remember that, uh,

24:27.460 --> 24:31.635
that HALO night...
j-jump that we did

24:31.680 --> 24:34.148
25 knots out in Misrata
last

24:34.210 --> 24:36.770
Oh, yeah.

24:36.820 --> 24:40.039
Just feel like my brain is still
waiting for the chute to deploy.

24:40.080 --> 24:41.559
Oh.

24:41.610 --> 24:43.828
Yeah, well, it shouldn't
be too much longer.

24:43.870 --> 24:45.167
We've located the SAMs.

24:45.220 --> 24:46.778
Once we get them neutralized,

24:46.830 --> 24:49.173
we can get that QRF in here
and go home, brother.

24:51.830 --> 24:53.832
Yeah.

24:53.880 --> 24:58.613
Ray, QRF, right?

24:58.670 --> 25:01.093
Yeah.

25:01.150 --> 25:02.924
Where-where are we
with Nouri?

25:02.970 --> 25:04.528
Noun.

25:04.590 --> 25:06.797
Must've got thrown from
the helo before the crash.

25:06.850 --> 25:08.499
So far, the drone hasn't
been able to pick him up.

25:08.550 --> 25:09.847
Let me tell you something:
if he's out there alive,

25:09.890 --> 25:10.936
I want him.

25:10.980 --> 25:12.766
I think you may be too late.

25:12.810 --> 25:14.323
I think the fall probably
finished him off.

25:14.380 --> 25:15.859
Well, listen,
let me tell you something:

25:15.900 --> 25:17.982
if he's out there,
I want to talk to him.

25:18.030 --> 25:19.509
About what"

25:19.560 --> 25:21.778
You heard what he said
before we boarded the helos.

25:21.820 --> 25:23.640
He said he knew Alan Cutter.

25:23.690 --> 25:26.477
Actually, I heard
yousay "Cutter."

25:26.520 --> 25:29.034
Far as I recall,
all Nouri did was repeat it.

25:29.090 --> 25:30.864
No.

25:30.920 --> 25:33.957
He said he knew
"The Englishman."

25:34.010 --> 25:35.568
He said he knew
the Englishman.

25:35.620 --> 25:37.303
Okay, okay.Alan Cutter.
Yeah, Ray.

25:37.360 --> 25:39.316
Okay, Jason?

25:39.360 --> 25:41.703
Alan Cutter's one of the biggest
military contractors

25:41.750 --> 25:43.092
in this whole country.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.356
Listen to me.You know, maybe Nouri

25:44.410 --> 25:45.752
saw him on TV.

25:45.800 --> 25:46.835
Listen.
Huh?

25:46.890 --> 25:48.107
Listen to what I'm saying.

25:48.150 --> 25:51.062
Steve Porter...

25:51.110 --> 25:55.809
knew Alan Cutter was
into some bad stuff.

25:55.850 --> 25:57.670
Like what"
Maybe, uh,

25:57.730 --> 25:59.595
getting his contractors to burn
the poppy fields so-so...

25:59.640 --> 26:01.289
so Salim Hakan or the Halanis

26:01.340 --> 26:03.808
could buy up the land
for the mining rights.

26:03.860 --> 26:05.942
Hmm?You know you're not making
any sense right now.

26:05.990 --> 26:07.514
What I am saying
right now

26:07.560 --> 26:10.120
makes complete sense.

26:11.430 --> 26:13.386
Brother, why don't we focus
on getting out of here, okay?

26:13.440 --> 26:14.862
Don't patronize me.

26:14.920 --> 26:18.083
Don't do that.
I know what I'm talking about.

26:18.140 --> 26:20.096
What, that Xeon Tactical is
in bed with the Halani brothers?

26:20.140 --> 26:22.222
Why is it that we could never
figure out why anyone

26:22.270 --> 26:23.658
wanted to take out Echo Team.

26:23.710 --> 26:25.052
Maybe that's the question

26:25.100 --> 26:27.011
they wanted us
to be asking ourselves,

26:27.060 --> 26:29.312
instead of focusing
on the real target.

26:29.370 --> 26:30.621
The one target.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.626
Steve Porter.

26:32.670 --> 26:34.456
You know what

26:34.500 --> 26:36.627
In this moment,
I don't care if Nouri Halani

26:36.680 --> 26:38.454
told you he was on
the damn grassy knoll.

26:38.500 --> 26:40.639
You are gonna sit down and
you're gonna close your eyes.

26:40.680 --> 26:42.898
And I will get you
when we're set for exfil.

26:42.940 --> 26:46.979
'Cause we got 25 bad guys
on their way to us,

26:47.040 --> 26:49.986
and I'm gonna make sure
we're ready for them.Ray. Ray.

26:50.040 --> 26:51.689
Get some rest.

27:13.060 --> 27:15.233
What you got there,
three eyes?

27:15.280 --> 27:17.976
Camouflaged bunker.

27:18.020 --> 27:19.100
Ah.

27:19.150 --> 27:21.846
Well, this looks
like a barrel of laughs.

27:24.120 --> 27:26.759
TOC, this is Bravo 3.

27:26.810 --> 27:29.153
We've located
the suspected mIssHe nest.

27:29.210 --> 27:30.939
I was wondering
if you could do me a solid

27:30.990 --> 27:33.117
and send some Hellfire
up this way?

27:33.170 --> 27:35.991
Considered it, but one
of those SAMs could take out

27:36.040 --> 27:37.860
our ISR before we get
to pull the trigger.

27:37.910 --> 27:40.174
Bravo 3, I suggest you come up
with another option.

27:42.000 --> 27:44.218
How the hell did I know
she was gonna say that?

27:49.750 --> 27:50.967
Standard bunker takedown?

27:51.010 --> 27:52.739
Yeah.

27:52.800 --> 27:54.358
Let's spur this pony.

27:54.410 --> 27:55.889
Brock, let's go.

28:03.110 --> 28:05.715
Hey, guys, I think
that you should see this.

28:08.680 --> 28:10.159
MANDY: Is that
who I think it is?

28:10.210 --> 28:11.689
He wasn't there
two minutes ago.

28:12.950 --> 28:14.724
Bravo 2, this is TOC.

28:14.780 --> 28:17.123
We believe we have a positive
ID. on Nouri Halani.

28:17.170 --> 28:19.388
A couple hundred meters
southeast of your location.

28:19.430 --> 28:20.818
What are your instructions, TOC?

28:22.220 --> 28:23.699
Leave him be.

28:23.740 --> 28:25.082
You're about
to come under attack.

28:25.130 --> 28:26.779
Say again,
under no circumstances

28:26.830 --> 28:28.912
are you to try
to retrieve Nouri Halani.

28:28.960 --> 28:30.177
Copy.

28:30.230 --> 28:32.004
What the hell's
that all about?

28:32.050 --> 28:33.779
Halani.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.523
He's still out there.
TOC spotted him.

28:35.580 --> 28:36.706
Not moving, probably dead.

28:36.750 --> 28:37.921
So?

28:37.970 --> 28:39.187
So under no circumstances

28:39.230 --> 28:40.367
are we to attempt
to retrieve him.

28:40.410 --> 28:42.059
Ray.Jason, what part

28:42.110 --> 28:44.977
of "under no circumstances"
do you not understand

28:47.420 --> 28:48.933
Bravo 6, this is Bravo 2.

28:48.980 --> 28:50.504
How are you doing
with those SA

28:50.550 --> 28:52.939
Prepping to assault.

28:52.990 --> 28:54.810
Well, we're taking fire.
Cowboy up and get it done.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.202
Check.

29:08.260 --> 29:09.989
ERIC: We got to
take out that SAM site,

29:10.050 --> 29:12.439
get our boys some help.

29:14.490 --> 29:16.173
Hey, Sonny,

29:16.230 --> 29:18.130
why don't you lay down some
heavy covering fire, okay?

29:18.190 --> 29:19.794
Brock and I are gonna flank them
down here on the right.

29:19.840 --> 29:22.058
Roger that. In position.

29:22.100 --> 29:23.317
Ready?

29:23.370 --> 29:27.101
Three, two, one, let's go.

29:49.350 --> 29:51.306
TOC, this is Bravo 6.

29:51.350 --> 29:52.305
Bunker's destroyed.

29:57.270 --> 30:00.262
Bravo, this is Lieutenant
Commander Blackburn,

30:00.320 --> 30:01.355
we are clear for QRF.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.960
I say again,
we are clear for QRF.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.369
Reload!

30:08.410 --> 30:10.184
Move on your left!

30:24.170 --> 30:27.207
Hey, Chief Hayes?

30:27.260 --> 30:30.559
What you said before about
having a family, you mean that?

30:30.610 --> 30:32.123
What'd I say?

30:32.170 --> 30:34.559
'Cause I-I love Anna.

30:37.180 --> 30:38.829
Tell you what, kid.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.950
Go get married.

30:41.010 --> 30:45.219
Have a bucketload of kids.

30:45.270 --> 30:47.613
Go on vacations.

30:47.670 --> 30:49.149
Get that house in the suburbs.

30:49.190 --> 30:51.010
I hope you have that boy.

30:51.060 --> 30:52.664
I want to defend my country,
huh? I want to fight.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.108
You want to fight? Yeah.Yeah.

30:54.150 --> 30:57.449
You want to be a hero.

31:00.510 --> 31:03.502
That's easy. That's real easy.

31:03.550 --> 31:05.199
You want to be a hero?
That's easy.

31:05.250 --> 31:06.899
Just don't give a damn.

31:06.950 --> 31:08.508
A bomb, a bullet.

31:08.560 --> 31:11.996
Something's gonna get you
eventually, so who cares?

31:12.040 --> 31:13.996
I don't know if I can
think that way.

31:14.040 --> 31:15.348
Sure you can.

31:15.390 --> 31:17.642
You know, fearlessness
is a habit.

31:17.700 --> 31:19.656
You get used to it
after a while.

31:19.700 --> 31:20.860
You'll be all right.Anna would care.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.262
Huh
Anna.

31:22.310 --> 31:24.619
Anna
She'd care.
IfI died, she'd care.

31:24.660 --> 31:26.218
Yeah. Aren't you
afraid of that?

31:26.270 --> 31:27.658
No, I'm not afraid of that.You'd be leaving

31:27.710 --> 31:29.314
your kids without a father.I can't be afraid of that.

31:29.360 --> 31:30.793
I cannot be afraid.
I wouldn't be afraid of that.Why

31:30.840 --> 31:32.182
'Cause if I would,
I would not...Because why?

31:32.230 --> 31:34.664
You wouldn't be what?!
'Cause you're Jason Hayes?

31:34.710 --> 31:37.668
Jason Hayes isn't afraid
of anything, huh?

31:44.510 --> 31:46.728
What are you laughing at?

31:49.210 --> 31:50.154
What are you laughing at?

31:50.210 --> 31:52.553
You. I'm laughing at you.

31:52.600 --> 31:54.420
You can't admit you're afraid
of failure.

31:54.470 --> 31:57.644
You can't admit that
you're afraid of failure!

31:57.690 --> 31:59.339
Oh, no, you can't be afraid
of failure

31:59.390 --> 32:00.345
'cause you already failed.

32:00.390 --> 32:02.346
Yeah, you did.

32:02.390 --> 32:05.393
Alana. Huh? That friend
you got killed, Nate.

32:05.440 --> 32:08.432
That little Syrian boy
with his lungs on fire.

32:08.490 --> 32:13.439
How about those 46 numbers you
still got in your cell phone?

32:13.490 --> 32:14.832
They're dead men!What'd you say?

32:14.880 --> 32:16.484
They're all dead men!What'd you say to me?

32:25.240 --> 32:27.196
Prepare to exfil.

32:27.240 --> 32:29.504
I'm gonna see you again.
I'm gonna see you again.

32:43.300 --> 32:45.996
Reload!

32:56.400 --> 32:58.743
Yes, sir.
That's great news.

32:58.800 --> 33:00.574
Thank you.

33:00.630 --> 33:03.360
Got two helos on the way.

33:03.410 --> 33:05.275
Bravo, this is TOC.

33:05.330 --> 33:07.139
QRF is on the way.

33:07.200 --> 33:10.363
Esti_ma_ted arrival time
is five minutes.

33:10.420 --> 33:11.671
RAY:
Copy that.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.369
Hold it down.
I'm going in.

33:13.420 --> 33:16.116
Jason!

33:16.160 --> 33:17.593
QRF is inbound. Jason!

33:17.640 --> 33:20.336
Get ready for exfil.

33:24.950 --> 33:27.475
Jason!

33:32.880 --> 33:34.745
DAVIS:
Bravo 2, this is TOC.

33:34.790 --> 33:36.269
I think we may
have a problem.

33:42.360 --> 33:44.533
We do.

34:26.280 --> 34:29.056
I'd hoped you were
all killed in the crash.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.578
Yeah. No such luck.

34:33.630 --> 34:38.067
My brother's men
shot down your helicopter.

34:38.110 --> 34:41.329
Abad must have made sure

34:41.380 --> 34:44.372
he had men waiting here
to make sure

34:44.430 --> 34:47.331
I never left this valley.

34:47.380 --> 34:50.645
Always a thinker, my brother.Listen to me.

34:50.690 --> 34:52.385
Listen to me.

34:52.430 --> 34:54.125
Before we got on the chopper,

34:54.170 --> 34:57.219
you said something
about the Englishman.

34:57.260 --> 34:59.137
Alan Cutter. Was
that Alan Cutter?

34:59.180 --> 35:01.398
Huh?

35:01.440 --> 35:05.399
Hey, hey. Not yet.

35:05.450 --> 35:09.147
What do you know
about Cutter?

35:09.190 --> 35:14.492
My father and I hid in these
mountains fighting Russians.

35:14.540 --> 35:16.974
Tell me about Cutter.
Tell me about Cutter.

35:17.020 --> 35:19.898
Or you're gonna die.
You're gonna die here.

35:19.940 --> 35:22.283
You think you frighten me?

35:22.330 --> 35:24.639
I know my death is coming.

35:26.210 --> 35:30.943
Perhaps I am not the only one

35:30.990 --> 35:33.254
who will die in this valley.

35:33.300 --> 35:36.519
If you die, your
brother wins.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.516
Don't let Abad win.

35:42.050 --> 35:43.347
Cutter. Tell me about Cutter.

35:43.400 --> 35:44.697
Don't let him win.

35:46.750 --> 35:49.184
Cutter, the Englishman...Yeah.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.482
...came by here last year.

35:51.540 --> 35:54.794
He talked about mining.

35:54.840 --> 35:57.491
Dirt worth lots of money.

35:57.540 --> 36:01.579
I knew Abad was tempted
by all this money.

36:01.630 --> 36:03.586
You're telling me your brother
made a deal with Cutter?

36:03.630 --> 36:06.190
Your brother made a deal
with Cutter?

36:06.250 --> 36:07.899
Tell me where he is.

36:09.640 --> 36:10.982
Parachinar.

36:11.030 --> 36:12.110
VVhat

36:12.170 --> 36:13.979
Parachinar.Parachinar, what?

36:14.040 --> 36:16.463
Across the border.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.772
Where my brother took sick.

36:18.820 --> 36:21.254
If you move quickly...
Yeah.

36:21.300 --> 36:23.473
...maybe you'll find him there.

36:27.180 --> 36:30.559
Hey, hey,
hey. Hey.

36:39.670 --> 36:41.581
RAY: What's happening,
boss man?

36:43.410 --> 36:45.878
Boss.

36:49.510 --> 36:52.593
Remember when we said we
weren't gonna go after Nouri...

36:52.640 --> 36:55.336
'cause it's too
dangerous out here?

36:55.380 --> 36:56.551
He's probably dead already.

37:02.300 --> 37:03.380
He's dead.

37:03.430 --> 37:05.512
Something we need to discuss?

37:05.570 --> 37:08.391
No. What you need to do
is you got to get to TOC.

37:08.440 --> 37:12.228
You got to tell them that
Abad is underground...

37:14.230 --> 37:16.619
...in Parachinar.

37:16.660 --> 37:17.968
You sure you're okay?

37:18.010 --> 37:20.752
Huh?

37:20.800 --> 37:23.360
Make the call.

37:25.800 --> 37:29.019
DAVIS: All Bravo call signs,
ISR shows a substantial number

37:29.070 --> 37:30.935
of enemy approaching
your position.

37:30.980 --> 37:33.289
Yeah, TOC.

37:33.330 --> 37:34.809
We're on the move.

37:43.340 --> 37:45.160
Looks like we're
okay for now.

37:45.210 --> 37:47.258
Main force has held up
about 700 meters out.

37:47.300 --> 37:48.517
All right.
You know that'll change

37:48.570 --> 37:49.867
as soon as they see our birds.

37:49.910 --> 37:52.265
SONNY: Parachinar.That's what Nouri said.

37:52.310 --> 37:54.039
Any chance we can get
the exfil birds

37:54.090 --> 37:55.523
to take us there
on the way home?

37:55.570 --> 37:57.561
Not enough fuel.Or firepower.

37:57.620 --> 37:59.747
All y'all are a bunch
of can't people.

37:59.790 --> 38:01.929
Plus we got wounded we got
to get to a field hospital.

38:01.970 --> 38:04.143
Look, I'm fine.
I'm fine. I'm fine.
TRENT:
I was talking about Shawford

38:04.190 --> 38:06.658
from Alpha.
He's got a fractured pelvis.

38:06.710 --> 38:09.361
Can't risk having
that thing displace.JASON: What about the, uh...

38:09.410 --> 38:12.368
crew chief?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.718
Um, what is his name?
Medders.

38:16.380 --> 38:17.369
What about Medders?

38:17.420 --> 38:19.502
He's gonna make it, right?

38:21.560 --> 38:23.505
Right?

38:23.560 --> 38:26.290
Jace, he took an AK round
through both of his lungs.

38:26.340 --> 38:28.558
That's not possible.

38:28.610 --> 38:30.214
RAY:
How come?

38:33.520 --> 38:36.216
'Cause he wouldn't have been
able to make a sound.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.783
He hasn't made a sound.

38:37.830 --> 38:40.355
The kid was dead from the time
we brought him in the house.

38:40.400 --> 38:41.708
Let's go, boys.Come on, guys.

38:44.400 --> 38:45.799
Come on, man. Let's go.

38:55.280 --> 38:57.840
Let's go, boss.
All right...
