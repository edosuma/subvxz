WEBVTT

00:23.690 --> 00:24.942
Aight, I'ma walk from here.

00:25.025 --> 00:26.068
Me too.

00:26.151 --> 00:27.236
I'm gonna Lyft.

00:27.319 --> 00:28.612
I'm rolling with you, right?

00:28.695 --> 00:29.821
-Yeah.
-All right.

00:31.073 --> 00:32.156
Hey, wait.

00:41.667 --> 00:43.502
-All right, Mus. We out.
-All right. Bet.

00:43.585 --> 00:46.880
Two first responders
have tested positive for the virus:

00:46.964 --> 00:51.218
a police officer, and a member
of the Baltimore Fire Department.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.263
As of right now, we feel
that there's nothing to worry about.

00:55.097 --> 00:56.098
Hey, boys.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.267
…in quarantine and are well cared for.

00:58.350 --> 01:00.519
Our departments are confident that…

01:01.228 --> 01:02.563
Hey, Mom. Hey, Dad.

01:03.188 --> 01:04.690
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Murphy.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.775
Hi, Phil. Hey.

01:06.859 --> 01:08.694
Drew, what happened to your face?

01:10.696 --> 01:12.573
It's nothing. It's just--

01:12.656 --> 01:15.158
-Got a little rough in practice tonight.
-Yeah.

01:15.242 --> 01:18.412
Phil caught you with one of
his legendary swinging elbows, huh?

01:18.495 --> 01:20.455
Yeah, I got him pretty good.

01:21.206 --> 01:24.751
But I hope it's okay
if I stay the night again.

01:24.835 --> 01:26.044
Your parents are fine with it?

01:26.628 --> 01:28.046
Yeah. My dad's working late tonight,

01:28.130 --> 01:30.799
but he wants to try to call you
in the morning.

01:30.883 --> 01:34.303
-You're welcome. Let me get ice for your…
-Thank you.

01:34.887 --> 01:35.971
cheek.

01:36.054 --> 01:38.348
Anthony Fauci,
the nation's top infectious di--

01:40.642 --> 01:41.977
Hey, man. You okay?

01:42.060 --> 01:43.854
No, man, I'm not.

01:43.937 --> 01:45.772
What did your parents say?

01:46.356 --> 01:49.985
I told them we were playing two on two
on the blacktop by Jace's house

01:50.068 --> 01:51.945
and I caught Phil's elbow.

01:52.696 --> 01:55.199
Man, why does it always have to be me?

01:55.282 --> 01:58.702
What the hell do we do?
I'm kinda freaking out right now.

01:58.785 --> 02:00.204
Yeah, I know. Me too.

02:00.287 --> 02:01.955
It's gonna be fine.

02:02.039 --> 02:04.708
How do you know?
Someone easily could have seen it.

02:06.210 --> 02:07.669
I gotta get outta here.

02:07.753 --> 02:08.753
Wait, Musa, come on.

02:08.836 --> 02:10.172
No, man. I can't talk.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.256
-Bro, where you going?
-Bro.

02:12.508 --> 02:14.551
What does he mean,
he's gotta get outta here?

02:16.386 --> 02:17.804
He's probably just nervous.

02:17.888 --> 02:19.598
I mean, we all are.

02:19.681 --> 02:21.475
Why did you hit that man like that?

02:24.520 --> 02:26.396
It looked like you were never gonna stop.

02:32.569 --> 02:34.112
I didn't want his ass to get up.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.697
Ever?

02:38.367 --> 02:40.285
He was hurting one of Jace's friends.

02:44.289 --> 02:47.084
That's all I know.
And we a family, right?

02:48.752 --> 02:49.753
Yeah.

02:50.504 --> 02:53.966
So, we had to have his back.

03:04.643 --> 03:06.395
But who the hell was that?

04:57.422 --> 05:00.551
I heard ol' boy got molly whopped
for cheating with his side piece.

05:00.634 --> 05:04.221
He was on the ground begging for his life.
I heard they all had on masks.

05:04.304 --> 05:07.474
Maybe they didn't want him
to get the coronavirus.

05:08.225 --> 05:11.562
-Who y'all talking about?
-Warrick, your coach. I thought you heard.

05:11.645 --> 05:13.105
-Wait, what?
-Yeah, girl.

05:13.188 --> 05:15.190
I can't believe they took down
a whole-ass coach.

05:15.274 --> 05:18.819
He's a legend. Three of his former players
made it to the WNBA.

05:18.902 --> 05:20.571
For real. They beat him so bad,

05:20.654 --> 05:22.781
they gave a new meaning
to bent out of shape.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.700
You okay?

05:26.368 --> 05:28.161
Yeah. I'm good.

05:31.123 --> 05:32.165
Yo, Jace. Wait up.

05:34.042 --> 05:35.252
You hear about the attack?

05:36.503 --> 05:38.964
-I might've.
-You might have what?

05:39.882 --> 05:41.592
Look, I gotta get to class.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.094
Jace, do you know something about this?

05:49.224 --> 05:50.392
Look, I did it.

05:52.311 --> 05:54.188
Coach Warrick. I handled him.

05:54.771 --> 05:56.231
Who else was there?

05:56.815 --> 05:58.150
It doesn't matter.

05:59.067 --> 06:02.279
It does matter.
I told you not to say anything.

06:02.362 --> 06:04.239
And I said I wouldn't say anything.

06:04.948 --> 06:06.617
I didn't say I wouldn't do anything.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.669
Ike. Ike!

06:19.087 --> 06:21.131
Hey, Lewis is running a little bit late.

06:21.215 --> 06:23.008
I'ma need you back on the floor
until he gets in.

06:23.091 --> 06:26.094
It's not really my problem, Sheila.
I got a game to get to.

06:26.178 --> 06:28.096
Well, it is now.

06:28.764 --> 06:30.182
Isaac, this is not a request.

06:30.265 --> 06:31.266
Like that?

06:32.142 --> 06:33.477
You'll get overtime.

06:45.197 --> 06:47.824
Your friend still coming to
my Holly Ann color consultation tomorrow?

06:47.908 --> 06:49.868
Yeah, she's coming.
And she's bringing her daughter.

06:50.452 --> 06:52.538
-I'll make sure they're on time.
-You know the deal.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.456
The district manager is gonna be there,

06:54.540 --> 06:56.917
and this will be
the biggest class I've ever done.

06:57.000 --> 06:59.086
Girl, you moving up.

06:59.169 --> 07:01.046
And you walking fast as hell.

07:01.129 --> 07:02.506
I gotta get to my son's game.

07:02.589 --> 07:05.342
He's got some prep school coaches coming
to watch him ball out.

07:05.425 --> 07:06.760
-Hey y'all.
-Hey.

07:06.844 --> 07:08.929
Let's see. Tasha.

07:09.012 --> 07:10.597
-Thank you.
-Here you go.

07:13.016 --> 07:16.228
-Tyrone, your facial kit.
-Yes. Right on time. Damn.

07:16.311 --> 07:18.188
-Jasmine, here's yours.
-Thank you.

07:18.272 --> 07:20.649
-Titi, here's your order.
-Thanks.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.484
Okay, I gotta run.
I'll see you later, girls.

07:22.568 --> 07:23.986
All right, bye.

07:31.034 --> 07:32.202
Man, where is he?

07:33.829 --> 07:35.205
I don't know.

07:48.051 --> 07:49.303
Fellas, bring it in.

07:51.138 --> 07:53.640
Yo, listen up.
I need y'all's focus. All right?

07:53.724 --> 07:54.808
Yes, sir.

07:54.892 --> 07:58.437
Aight. Coach Ike got held up at work,
but he'll be here in a few,

07:58.520 --> 08:01.899
so just make sure
you're on point, all right?

08:02.482 --> 08:05.235
Musa's on a plane to California
with his mom.

08:05.319 --> 08:09.656
His grandfather's in the hospital.
They're going out to help his grandmother.

08:09.740 --> 08:11.325
Is the grandfather gonna be all right?

08:12.242 --> 08:14.661
Inshallah. He will.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.331
He's got the coronavirus.

08:18.916 --> 08:20.584
When is Musa coming back?

08:21.585 --> 08:22.586
We're not sure.

08:23.795 --> 08:25.464
But in terms of this game,

08:26.131 --> 08:29.510
Jace, Nick,
you're splitting point guard duty today.

08:29.593 --> 08:30.594
Bet.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.095
Okay.

08:33.013 --> 08:36.475
One more thing. Police are investigating
an attack on Coach Warrick.

08:37.100 --> 08:38.184
He coaches girls basketball.

08:38.268 --> 08:41.563
Now, if any of you hear anything
that can aid in that investigation,

08:41.647 --> 08:45.400
I need you to tell me, or Coach Ike,
or Coach Meg. Clear?

08:45.484 --> 08:46.485
Yes, Coach.

08:46.568 --> 08:49.863
All right. All right. Come on.
Let's go. Let's get it. Be ready in three.

09:04.378 --> 09:05.921
What the hell are you doing?

09:06.588 --> 09:08.131
Studying Vince's tendencies.

09:09.132 --> 09:11.009
Okay, but why?

09:11.635 --> 09:14.888
I learn different from everybody else.
So, it's easy for me to memorize things.

09:14.972 --> 09:16.515
I know one of your tendencies too.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.725
Oh, yeah? What is it?

09:19.560 --> 09:21.728
Anytime you go one-on-one from the left,

09:21.812 --> 09:26.650
cross over twice and then attack the lane,
or do a step-back three.

09:28.110 --> 09:30.445
-I do? Damn.
-Yeah.

09:32.197 --> 09:33.740
Maybe I need to add to my bag.

09:35.117 --> 09:36.952
I'm not trying to go to jail, man.

09:37.953 --> 09:39.872
We're good. Aight?

09:41.123 --> 09:43.542
-Just act normal.
-You ready to tell us what this is about?

09:43.625 --> 09:47.045
Hey, we hoopin' today,
or you gonna stand around talking shit?

09:48.589 --> 09:50.632
Hey man,
I know we got off on the wrong foot.

09:50.716 --> 09:53.260
That's my bad. You like comic books?

09:53.343 --> 09:54.344
Yeah, I guess so.

09:54.428 --> 09:58.432
Cool. And just so we're clear, I'm Batman.

09:58.515 --> 09:59.933
Play your role, Robin.

10:00.517 --> 10:01.602
Yeah.

10:23.624 --> 10:25.876
I'm just now leaving.
I'll be there as quick as I can.

10:26.710 --> 10:27.878
This sucks.

10:27.961 --> 10:29.463
Yeah. Who are you telling?

10:29.546 --> 10:31.298
You know what else sucks?

10:31.381 --> 10:34.468
Ever since Royale's dad's
been helping out Nick and his mom,

10:34.551 --> 10:36.887
we're on our own
with a few other outstanding bills.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.972
Bills? What bills?

10:39.056 --> 10:42.893
Upcoming tournament fees.
We still owe money on our uniforms.

10:44.228 --> 10:46.313
Might have to defer our salaries
for the week.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.315
Damn.

10:51.693 --> 10:53.737
Fine. That's fine.

10:54.905 --> 10:56.823
Looks like you're not the only one
running late.

10:57.824 --> 10:58.825
-Sup?
-How you doing, my man?

10:58.909 --> 11:00.702
There's hardly anyone here.

11:00.786 --> 11:03.247
They're just waiting for me
to make my grand entrance.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.082
Glad you cleared that up.

11:11.380 --> 11:13.048
-Hello. Hey.
-Hey.

11:13.131 --> 11:15.592
-Hey. How are you?
-I'm good, thank you.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.679
So, I'm planning on
taking Hope Hill Academy to elite status.

11:18.762 --> 11:21.265
From what I hear,
your son could really help us out.

11:21.348 --> 11:25.769
But we both know Westgate Prep,
perfect fit for Jace.

11:25.853 --> 11:29.731
Gentlemen, my son and I have
the highest respect for both programs.

11:29.815 --> 11:32.568
-I look forward to future conversations.
-Sure.

11:33.110 --> 11:35.529
-We supposed to hit elbows now.
-Yeah.

11:37.406 --> 11:38.991
Yo, this is crazy.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.159
He got it too?

11:43.620 --> 11:44.788
Let me see.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.380
That's my boy. Good job. Let's hustle.

11:57.801 --> 11:58.802
Here!

12:02.264 --> 12:03.891
Move! Move!

12:04.808 --> 12:06.059
Come on, y'all, look alive!

12:11.565 --> 12:12.566
Nicolás!

12:14.902 --> 12:17.362
-Bro, give me the ball. Give me the ball.
-Give me it.

12:25.037 --> 12:26.622
Slow it down! Slow it down!

12:26.705 --> 12:28.624
Yo, take it all the way!

12:28.707 --> 12:29.917
Damn.

12:31.668 --> 12:33.629
You can't dream of having hops like that.

12:44.515 --> 12:45.599
Come on, Drew!

12:52.439 --> 12:55.567
Where the hell is our heads at?
Come on! Lock in!

13:08.789 --> 13:09.790
Offensive foul.

13:09.873 --> 13:12.292
Yo! Ref!

13:12.376 --> 13:13.752
Royale, Sidney.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.337
Ricky, get in.

13:15.963 --> 13:17.297
Let's go. Show up!

13:17.381 --> 13:18.924
Drew! Phil! Jace!

13:44.575 --> 13:45.826
Yeah!

13:46.577 --> 13:49.454
Dropping dimes, son!
Good finish, Nick!

13:54.626 --> 13:55.836
You and me both.

14:10.392 --> 14:13.061
So glad you could join us today, Coach.

14:13.145 --> 14:15.439
Was that the new offense
you were telling me about?

14:16.064 --> 14:19.067
New offense doesn't account for
three of our starters having off games

14:19.151 --> 14:20.903
and us not having our point guard.

14:20.986 --> 14:22.863
It's your job to account for that.

14:23.864 --> 14:26.825
So, I account for Jace missing dunks?

14:26.909 --> 14:30.746
Before your offense,
he hadn't missed a dunk since he was 12.

14:31.622 --> 14:35.334
Look. I just need everyone
to trust the process.

14:36.335 --> 14:38.545
It's gonna take a little time to jell.

14:39.171 --> 14:40.964
About how much time you talking about?

14:41.048 --> 14:42.382
A little.

14:46.720 --> 14:49.848
Search online
and see if you can find anything

14:49.932 --> 14:52.351
about him having some problems
with some teammates

14:52.434 --> 14:54.269
or his father who had coached him.

14:54.353 --> 14:55.729
Ma, are you serious?

14:55.812 --> 14:57.689
I heard some stuff.

14:59.566 --> 15:02.152
Look, if you can spend all your free time

15:02.236 --> 15:04.947
digging up everything there is to know
about Solange and Drake,

15:05.030 --> 15:06.240
you can do this for me.

15:12.412 --> 15:15.123
We got the win,
but that ain't how we play.

15:15.791 --> 15:19.419
It was sloppy as hell,
undisciplined, and unfocused.

15:20.712 --> 15:24.007
Some of y'all played with heart.
Some of y'all just didn't show up.

15:25.259 --> 15:26.718
And that can't happen.

15:30.222 --> 15:32.683
Nick, take us out today.

15:40.357 --> 15:42.985
-Hard work on three. One. Two. Three.
-Hard work!

15:44.403 --> 15:46.280
You three. Wait.

15:55.247 --> 15:56.957
Y'all wanna tell me
what the hell is going on?

15:57.791 --> 15:59.042
We just had an off game.

16:00.586 --> 16:02.212
It happens, Coach.

16:02.296 --> 16:04.631
Nothing just happens. Not like that.

16:04.715 --> 16:08.427
You tell us to show up,
but you show up late.

16:08.510 --> 16:10.762
That was my boss's decision, not mine.

16:12.055 --> 16:15.225
Y'all made the decision to not give a damn
about what happened on the court.

16:15.309 --> 16:17.686
And the decisions you make
come with consequences.

16:18.478 --> 16:22.566
If you decide to keep playing that way,
get used to riding the bench. You got me?

16:24.193 --> 16:26.236
My mom's waiting outside, Coach.

16:29.156 --> 16:30.157
Can I go?

16:31.158 --> 16:32.576
Y'all get home safe.

16:33.911 --> 16:37.289
I think that new offense
took you off your game and rhythm tonight.

16:37.372 --> 16:39.208
You only scored nine points.

16:39.291 --> 16:42.794
I can't remember
the last time you scored single digits.

16:43.670 --> 16:46.131
I mean, you have no idea
who was there tonight.

16:47.966 --> 16:49.885
We don't have to talk about it right now.

16:50.469 --> 16:51.470
Thanks.

16:52.471 --> 16:54.598
Can we get wings or something?

16:55.349 --> 16:56.391
Sure, baby.

17:01.271 --> 17:03.982
It's devastating. It really is.

17:04.066 --> 17:08.569
But due to his injuries, Coach Warrick
will not be with us for several weeks.

17:08.654 --> 17:11.198
Vida's mother, Gloria,
who played college ball,

17:11.281 --> 17:14.409
is gonna be stepping in
to take over his duties until he returns.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.328
It's only temporary, ladies.

17:16.912 --> 17:20.082
I know this is difficult news
for all of us.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.669
But we cannot let it get in the way
of the progress that we've made.

17:23.752 --> 17:26.839
Coach Warrick would want all of you
to keep going.

17:28.006 --> 17:29.299
Rise above this.

17:30.551 --> 17:32.886
Ms. Russell,
may I lead a prayer for Coach?

17:32.970 --> 17:34.221
Absolutely.

17:36.849 --> 17:40.644
Holy Father, we come to you
with heavy hearts and pure souls.

17:40.727 --> 17:44.106
We ask that you protect Coach Warrick
and grant him a full recovery.

17:44.189 --> 17:47.359
We ask that you bring the people
who harmed him to justice.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.237
In your name, we pray. Amen.

17:50.320 --> 17:51.822
Amen.

18:04.209 --> 18:06.378
After every practice…

18:09.256 --> 18:15.679
the only one out of the locker room
faster than me was you.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.518
I thought I was the only one.

18:23.937 --> 18:27.900
But I saw the way he looked at you,
the way he hyped you up.

18:30.319 --> 18:32.529
That's how he treated me
when I first joined the team.

18:36.450 --> 18:38.118
He promised me South Carolina.

18:39.119 --> 18:40.621
For me, it was Maryland.

18:41.205 --> 18:45.667
He told me I was the best player
to join the team in ten years.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.004
Me too.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.134
And the car rides were the worst, right?

18:59.556 --> 19:00.849
The first time,

19:00.933 --> 19:03.644
I thought he was really trying
to get me a new pair of shoes.

19:04.686 --> 19:06.980
I mean, I had been wearing
the same sneakers for months.

19:08.732 --> 19:09.733
And he noticed.

19:10.567 --> 19:12.110
When we first got to Footaction,

19:13.070 --> 19:16.031
he told me I could get
any pair of kicks I wanted.

19:17.991 --> 19:21.370
I picked the Kyrie 5's
with pink and purple laces for good luck.

19:21.954 --> 19:23.705
He even threw in a pair of socks.

19:29.628 --> 19:30.921
He drove me home…

19:38.387 --> 19:39.388
and then…

19:45.978 --> 19:47.437
I didn't know what to do.

19:51.358 --> 19:54.319
He told me I was so special.

19:54.903 --> 19:56.989
And no other player was on my level.

20:00.492 --> 20:01.493
I guessed I believed him.

20:02.828 --> 20:07.374
I know I shouldn't feel like this,
but I'm glad someone beat his ass.

20:22.514 --> 20:24.558
Yo, what the hell.
You can't answer my texts, bro?

20:24.641 --> 20:27.728
You just dip out on us
when things get hard, huh?

20:27.811 --> 20:29.438
Look, y'all, I--

20:33.066 --> 20:34.443
My grandfather's sick.

20:34.526 --> 20:36.486
-Is that the real reason you left?
-Yo.

20:37.821 --> 20:39.031
It's his grandfather.

20:39.948 --> 20:41.408
And it doesn't even matter.

20:41.491 --> 20:42.868
Hey, how's he doing?

20:43.493 --> 20:44.828
They got him on a ventilator.

20:47.080 --> 20:50.375
You know, I don't know why we did that.

20:52.711 --> 20:54.796
I've never been in a fight
in my entire life.

20:55.380 --> 20:56.673
He's not a good guy.

20:56.757 --> 20:58.717
Well, I don't believe in violence at all.

20:58.800 --> 21:01.094
And not to mention,
we beat down another brother.

21:01.178 --> 21:03.096
What if we get arrested?
What happens then?

21:03.180 --> 21:06.308
That would ruin our chances
of going to a good school.

21:07.267 --> 21:11.605
That could possibly ruin our shot at D1.

21:11.688 --> 21:13.941
Hey, Warrick's Crystal's coach, right?

21:16.568 --> 21:18.237
What did he do to her?

21:18.946 --> 21:20.155
Can't talk about it.

21:20.989 --> 21:23.617
You tellin' me you put all our asses
on the line for some girl

21:23.700 --> 21:24.868
and you can't talk about it?

21:24.952 --> 21:26.495
She is not just some girl!

21:28.956 --> 21:30.832
Then what are we supposed to do, huh?

21:30.916 --> 21:33.210
Just sit here and wait for this
to come back on us?

21:33.293 --> 21:36.797
If we get busted, I'll take the heat.
I'll tell the cops I made us do it.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.674
I mean, I did throw the most punches.

21:38.757 --> 21:41.260
No, you're already been taking
too much heat at home.

21:42.386 --> 21:45.138
-What are y'all talking about?
-They need to know.

21:46.223 --> 21:48.934
Phil… he's got some bruises.

21:49.518 --> 21:50.936
Aight.

21:51.019 --> 21:52.187
So do I.

21:52.771 --> 21:54.731
I don't think Phil's are from basketball.

21:55.524 --> 21:57.192
-You aight?
-Come on, y'all.

21:58.110 --> 22:00.821
Haven't you ever been whooped before?
I'm fine.

22:00.904 --> 22:02.281
Nah, Phil.

22:03.365 --> 22:06.243
Look, man, it's just us, okay?
You can be real.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.373
My dad's cool and all, but…

22:13.000 --> 22:15.752
you know, sometimes he goes too far.
I don't know.

22:16.461 --> 22:22.009
Musa, you've never been in a fight before,
but I feel like my whole life's a fight.

22:22.092 --> 22:24.595
We got you. Aight?

22:26.930 --> 22:29.057
None of y'all are
taking the heat for anything.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.436
If we get caught, it was my plan.

22:33.020 --> 22:34.563
All we gotta do is act normal.

22:34.646 --> 22:37.941
We don't even talk.
We don't even comment on the situation.

22:38.025 --> 22:40.527
Aight, this stays between us. Aight?

22:41.278 --> 22:42.654
Hey, we family, right?

22:42.738 --> 22:43.864
-Family.
-Family.

22:44.531 --> 22:45.532
Family.

22:50.204 --> 22:53.332
You know, most people would
schedule a meeting before just showing up.

22:53.415 --> 22:54.416
I would assume so.

22:56.627 --> 22:58.212
-After you.
-Thank you.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.007
Water?

23:02.633 --> 23:03.634
Sure.

23:04.510 --> 23:05.761
Okay.

23:09.806 --> 23:11.433
So, what can I do for you?

23:13.810 --> 23:16.063
You made a play
to get Nick back on the Dominion Ballers.

23:17.397 --> 23:18.899
Sorry that didn't work out for you.

23:19.483 --> 23:21.652
Yeah, you seem really broken up about it.

23:23.487 --> 23:27.157
How'd you do it? Honestly--
Come out of pocket?

23:27.241 --> 23:29.660
-I don't know what you mean.
-I mean, I know his family isn't rich,

23:29.743 --> 23:31.954
and I know they need a place
to rest their heads.

23:32.037 --> 23:34.957
Alonzo, he's with us now. Deal with it.

23:35.916 --> 23:37.084
Perhaps we can talk about

23:37.167 --> 23:39.086
the win-win situation
we find ourselves in.

23:39.169 --> 23:42.214
Wow. You sound very sure of yourself.

23:43.549 --> 23:45.634
So, question: how long do you think

23:45.717 --> 23:50.389
Jace Carson will stick around
playing Pippen to Nick's MJ?

23:51.098 --> 23:53.225
Long enough for us to dominate the DMV.

23:55.185 --> 23:57.271
We take on the Dominion Ballers next week.

23:57.855 --> 24:01.191
You're gonna wanna be
on the winning side of that slaughter.

24:01.275 --> 24:04.152
I have five teams and five locales
for this launch.

24:04.236 --> 24:07.614
The Dominion Ballers is
Gladiator's team for the DMV.

24:08.115 --> 24:11.618
So, switching area allegiance mid-season?

24:11.702 --> 24:13.370
It's not a good corporate look for us.

24:13.453 --> 24:15.706
But backing a loser is?

24:18.333 --> 24:20.294
Okay. Real talk?

24:21.378 --> 24:24.256
-Please.
-I would love to sponsor Swagger.

24:24.923 --> 24:26.133
Seriously.

24:26.216 --> 24:31.805
But if a kid, a Black kid,
isn't practically flawless,

24:32.347 --> 24:35.434
it doesn't check off all of the boxes
that I need to make it work.

24:35.517 --> 24:37.436
I mean, it's not right,

24:37.519 --> 24:40.272
but that's the corporate-ass structure
that I work in.

24:40.355 --> 24:43.108
My kids get A's and B's. Check.

24:43.192 --> 24:45.527
They don't do drugs. Check.

24:45.611 --> 24:47.446
You don't want kids
that have tattoos. Check.

24:48.655 --> 24:50.407
How much more choirboy
do you need them to be?

24:50.490 --> 24:53.869
Your head coach got into a altercation
with another coach.

24:53.952 --> 24:58.540
And Jace Carson apparently attacked
a player during a game.

24:58.624 --> 25:00.000
Attacked?

25:00.083 --> 25:02.586
It's in the scouting report. I'm sorry.

25:03.295 --> 25:05.631
Yeah. You are.

25:12.346 --> 25:13.680
Meg.

25:16.600 --> 25:19.478
The NBA is going to announce
that they're suspending the season.

25:19.561 --> 25:22.147
-What?
-Yeah. We got tipped off.

25:22.814 --> 25:25.984
And there's a strong chance
that the youth teams will follow suit.

25:26.068 --> 25:28.111
So, if that happens,

25:29.321 --> 25:30.614
will you guys be able to stay afloat?

25:30.697 --> 25:31.949
What do you care?

25:32.032 --> 25:34.826
You just have to ask yourself,
if you guys go under,

25:35.494 --> 25:37.621
will that be fair
to Nick and the other players?

25:46.964 --> 25:51.468
When the Step Queens
Hit the stage

25:51.552 --> 25:54.179
You know we 'bout to go off

25:54.263 --> 25:59.560
So sit back, relax, and watch us go hard
If you--

25:59.643 --> 26:01.562
Go… Go.

26:01.645 --> 26:03.689
Go hard. If you…

26:05.148 --> 26:08.569
-Come on, Jack. You gotta get this. Okay.
-You will.

26:08.652 --> 26:09.736
Mom, you don't understand.

26:09.820 --> 26:12.072
If I don't come tight,
I might not get to do another solo.

26:12.155 --> 26:13.323
So come tight then.

26:13.407 --> 26:16.743
But just know if you don't get the solo,
it's not the end of the world.

26:17.327 --> 26:20.080
Mom, everyone is gonna be there.

26:20.747 --> 26:22.833
We're competing against top teams,

26:22.916 --> 26:25.419
and the next competition is
four months away.

26:26.670 --> 26:28.046
I gotta show up for this one.

26:28.130 --> 26:29.381
You got it.

26:31.967 --> 26:33.177
Just keep going.

26:35.679 --> 26:38.098
Here, let's do it together. Slowly.

26:38.807 --> 26:40.517
Okay. You ready?

26:41.768 --> 26:44.730
Five, six, seven, eight.

26:45.480 --> 26:50.527
When the Step Queens hit the stage

26:50.611 --> 26:54.072
You know we 'bout to go off

26:54.656 --> 26:57.367
So sit back, relax, and watch--

26:58.118 --> 27:01.663
-Left, right. Yeah.
-Okay, wait.

27:01.747 --> 27:04.541
Okay, come--
Can we do it again, but faster this time?

27:04.625 --> 27:05.459
…eight.

27:05.542 --> 27:09.671
When the Step Queens hit the stage

27:09.755 --> 27:12.633
You know we 'bout to go off

27:13.217 --> 27:17.262
So sit back, relax
And watch us go hard

27:18.013 --> 27:20.307
Girl, you get this from your mama.

27:20.390 --> 27:21.391
Okay.

27:21.475 --> 27:23.936
At one time I thought
I could be a dancer or something.

27:24.019 --> 27:25.020
Wait, really?

27:25.103 --> 27:27.147
I met your dad dancing at a party.

27:27.731 --> 27:30.108
He was doing this little tired two-step,

27:30.192 --> 27:32.778
and I was doing my dance
in the middle of the floor

27:32.861 --> 27:34.696
and had everyone watching me.

27:34.780 --> 27:36.281
I guess he felt brave that night,

27:36.365 --> 27:38.742
'cause he came up
and he asked if he could join me.

27:39.952 --> 27:42.037
And we danced for a long time.

27:42.120 --> 27:43.497
And then what happened?

27:46.583 --> 27:47.584
Don't matter.

27:48.210 --> 27:50.087
Come on, let's get this move down, baby.

27:51.046 --> 27:53.465
So the stomp, stomp, clap, clap?

27:53.549 --> 27:54.800
-Okay.
-Okay, ready?

27:54.883 --> 27:57.386
Five, six, seven, eight.

27:59.096 --> 28:00.722
So watch us go hard

28:02.474 --> 28:03.934
Show us your moves, Jace.

28:04.810 --> 28:07.104
-Show us your moves.
-Mom.

28:09.189 --> 28:11.024
So watch us go hard.

28:12.192 --> 28:13.652
-Come on.
-Six, seven, eight.

28:15.153 --> 28:17.447
Boy, you need to stick to basketball.

28:17.531 --> 28:20.075
Come on, girl.
Show us how it's done once more.

28:22.244 --> 28:25.122
It was Armageddon at that supermarket.

28:25.205 --> 28:27.249
Yeah, but 24 rolls of toilet paper, baby?

28:28.250 --> 28:30.377
I would've got 50, but they sold out.

28:30.961 --> 28:33.755
I'll go to another market,
get some more supplies tonight.

28:35.716 --> 28:38.218
-Tonight?
-It's not like we got plans.

28:38.302 --> 28:40.304
Do not even try.
You know tonight is the step show.

28:40.971 --> 28:43.307
-Babe.
-Don't give me that. Don't give me that.

28:43.390 --> 28:46.143
My line sister coached one of the teams,
and it's the championships.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.437
It'll be fun. Just…

29:00.115 --> 29:01.450
Can I help you?

29:01.533 --> 29:03.118
Yeah, I'm looking for my son.

29:04.453 --> 29:05.454
Excuse me?

29:05.537 --> 29:06.747
I'm Phil's father.

29:07.331 --> 29:08.624
You're Mr. Marksby?

29:08.707 --> 29:10.501
I always see you on the team emails,

29:10.584 --> 29:13.378
but I was wondering
when I'd see you at one of our games.

29:13.462 --> 29:17.007
I either pay your dues by going to work
or come to games.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.509
I'd love to do both.

29:19.092 --> 29:20.844
But all of us
don't got that choice, now do we?

29:22.971 --> 29:24.056
Mr. Marksby.

29:26.266 --> 29:27.267
Phil.

29:27.351 --> 29:29.228
I'm Tonya, Ike's wife.

29:29.811 --> 29:30.854
Good to meet you.

29:31.396 --> 29:32.397
Come in.

29:33.106 --> 29:34.107
It's okay.

29:49.540 --> 29:50.749
You know where my son is?

29:52.042 --> 29:53.043
Naw.

29:55.462 --> 29:57.798
Has Phil's mother seen or heard from him?

29:57.881 --> 30:00.133
His mom doesn't stay around here.

30:01.051 --> 30:05.180
Phil said he was staying with a teammate.
I thought you might know something.

30:05.264 --> 30:08.934
No, I don't. He was at our game,
I can tell you that.

30:09.017 --> 30:10.435
Well, how'd he seem?

30:11.311 --> 30:12.396
He's fine.

30:13.480 --> 30:16.275
He's a strong player.
He always pulls through.

30:16.859 --> 30:18.443
When's the last time you heard from him?

30:19.278 --> 30:20.612
Day before yesterday.

30:21.405 --> 30:22.781
I know he came home the other night

30:22.865 --> 30:25.659
'cause he ate my food
and changed his clothes.

30:27.286 --> 30:29.496
Listen, if you see him, just…

30:31.164 --> 30:32.666
tell him he needs to call me.

30:41.925 --> 30:43.218
What was that?

30:43.302 --> 30:46.889
Meg told me that Phil's mom
caught a drug charge a while back.

30:46.972 --> 30:48.432
I think she's still locked up.

30:50.267 --> 30:51.560
Does he talk about her?

30:51.643 --> 30:52.644
No.

30:53.270 --> 30:54.646
Not to me.

31:02.696 --> 31:03.864
Phil, where you at?

31:05.449 --> 31:08.160
Hey, Coach.
I'm at Drew's house right now.

31:08.243 --> 31:10.037
Does your father know that?

31:10.746 --> 31:11.747
Yeah.

31:12.414 --> 31:14.416
I just spoke to him a little while ago.

31:14.499 --> 31:15.667
When, exactly?

31:17.920 --> 31:19.630
An hour or something.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.175
But, look. Look, we're about to eat,

31:23.675 --> 31:25.594
so I gotta go.

31:25.677 --> 31:26.678
All right.

31:27.387 --> 31:28.388
All right.

31:35.812 --> 31:40.817
Go, you got it!
Go, go, go, go! Let's go! You got it!

31:40.901 --> 31:42.819
Run, run, run! Go, go, go!

31:44.905 --> 31:47.074
Yes! That's my baby!

31:47.157 --> 31:48.367
That's my boy!

31:53.288 --> 31:56.124
I'm gonna be a wide receiver
for Washington when I grow up.

31:56.208 --> 31:58.794
Well, you did good
out there today, Phil, but…

32:00.295 --> 32:02.506
I mean, tackling is way too dangerous.

32:02.589 --> 32:05.425
I ain't scared, Dad.
See the way I dipped on those fools?

32:05.509 --> 32:07.886
When I'm running like that,
it feels like I'm flying.

32:07.970 --> 32:09.429
Like I'm floating or something.

32:09.513 --> 32:12.432
You are, baby.
You fly past all them haters.

32:12.516 --> 32:15.227
We know you love it, but I mean,

32:16.353 --> 32:17.729
what if something were to happen to you?

32:18.772 --> 32:20.107
What would we do?

32:30.075 --> 32:31.076
Phil.

32:31.827 --> 32:33.287
Is there anything you want to tell us?

32:35.247 --> 32:36.248
No.

32:37.082 --> 32:40.711
Drew, will you go to your room
so we can talk to Phil privately?

32:40.794 --> 32:43.297
-But Mom--
-Drew. Go.

32:52.681 --> 32:55.809
So, what's going on, man?

32:56.435 --> 32:57.436
Nothing.

32:59.980 --> 33:02.232
Your father stopped by my place earlier.

33:03.275 --> 33:04.651
He said he hadn't seen you.

33:04.735 --> 33:07.738
You told us
he was fine with you being here.

33:12.492 --> 33:14.703
Why wouldn't you tell him you're here?

33:14.786 --> 33:16.288
Is there something going on?

33:16.371 --> 33:17.789
I don't know.

33:17.873 --> 33:20.459
Look, we all just want
to make sure you okay.

33:20.542 --> 33:22.127
I didn't ask y'all to come over here.

33:23.587 --> 33:24.796
All right.

33:25.797 --> 33:29.676
All of this sitting has got
my back hurting, and I need a walk.

33:35.974 --> 33:37.809
Your father seems like a hard worker.

33:40.562 --> 33:41.563
Yeah.

33:42.397 --> 33:43.440
He works night shifts.

33:45.901 --> 33:47.653
My dad used to work long hours too.

33:49.363 --> 33:55.410
And then he'd come home,
and he used to chop wood in our backyard.

33:57.788 --> 34:03.252
I never understood why he chopped wood,
because we never used our fireplace.

34:03.335 --> 34:04.503
But…

34:06.129 --> 34:09.132
almost every day, after work…

34:11.385 --> 34:12.803
that's where he'd be.

34:12.886 --> 34:15.264
And then one day I asked him why. And…

34:17.516 --> 34:18.766
And he told me he chopped wood

34:18.851 --> 34:24.690
because after working for a boss
who treated him like garbage all day…

34:26.859 --> 34:28.443
he had to do something.

34:30.487 --> 34:34.616
He had to take his anger out on something.

34:37.995 --> 34:40.539
He needed a productive way to release.

34:40.621 --> 34:42.373
We all do, sometimes.

34:42.456 --> 34:47.295
Basketball's really the only place
I feel like I can truly let my guard down.

34:49.630 --> 34:50.716
I feel free.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.302
Like I can fly.

34:56.804 --> 34:58.765
My moms used to love it when I'd say that.

34:58.849 --> 35:02.227
I get that your mom's not around.
And I know that's not easy.

35:05.606 --> 35:06.607
No.

35:11.069 --> 35:12.821
How do you feel
about living with your dad?

35:20.370 --> 35:21.705
My mom's already locked up.

35:22.414 --> 35:26.001
Do you feel safe with your dad?

35:26.752 --> 35:27.753
I mean…

35:32.049 --> 35:34.218
My dad's just under
a lot of pressure right now.

35:41.183 --> 35:42.267
It's okay.

35:45.187 --> 35:47.940
It's okay. It's all right.

35:56.532 --> 35:57.533
Come on.

35:59.993 --> 36:03.247
If Phil won't tell us what's wrong,
what can we do?

36:03.330 --> 36:05.207
He loves his father.

36:06.416 --> 36:08.210
But something's off. I could feel it.

36:08.877 --> 36:12.840
And without any obvious signs of abuse,
it's tough.

36:12.923 --> 36:15.676
I could check in with my coworkers at CPS,

36:15.759 --> 36:20.013
see if there's a open case or a file
on Mr. Marksby, and go from there.

36:27.104 --> 36:28.146
Damn.

36:29.731 --> 36:30.858
I missed it.

36:30.941 --> 36:33.235
Don't be so hard on yourself, baby.

36:33.318 --> 36:36.864
It's just--
Here I am thinking my kids are immature.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.075
And they dealing with some grown-up shit.

36:40.158 --> 36:41.618
They looking out for each other.

36:41.702 --> 36:44.162
And maybe you having
more of an impact on them than you think.

36:44.246 --> 36:46.623
Besides, you are here now.

36:47.457 --> 36:49.001
And that's gotta count for something.

36:51.670 --> 36:53.255
You know what? Let's just…

36:56.383 --> 36:57.718
forget it.

36:57.801 --> 37:01.555
Let's just skip the step show
and call it a night.

37:02.890 --> 37:05.976
No, I think we need this.

37:06.810 --> 37:07.728
Let's go.

37:08.312 --> 37:10.272
-Yeah?
-Oh, yeah.

37:44.056 --> 37:45.224
Sup, Mus?

37:47.768 --> 37:48.852
What's up, man?

37:50.521 --> 37:51.980
Your grandfather okay?

37:52.898 --> 37:54.191
Nah. They…

37:56.485 --> 37:57.861
They don't think he's gonna make it.

37:58.570 --> 37:59.696
Damn.

38:01.031 --> 38:02.366
Damn, man, I'm sorry.

38:02.950 --> 38:03.992
Thanks.

38:06.370 --> 38:09.498
But have y'all heard
any more about the investigation?

38:10.791 --> 38:12.125
Nah.

38:12.209 --> 38:14.211
Well, my pops said

38:14.294 --> 38:18.131
the cops think Warrick was beat up
by four angry fans who were pissed at him

38:18.215 --> 38:19.633
because he left his starters in a game.

38:19.716 --> 38:21.677
They already crushed the other team by 40.

38:22.845 --> 38:24.763
Though they still can't prove it.

38:27.140 --> 38:29.518
I don't know, Jace. Maybe we'll be fine.

38:30.310 --> 38:31.311
Yeah.

38:32.354 --> 38:33.355
Think so.

38:33.438 --> 38:35.482
I guess I'll talk to you later.

38:35.983 --> 38:37.693
All right, man, I'll get with you.

38:39.319 --> 38:40.320
All right, yo.

38:48.120 --> 38:51.248
Hey, girl.
It's usually standing room only in here.

38:52.499 --> 38:54.168
Didn't know you was into stepping, Coach.

38:55.335 --> 38:58.964
-This baby's stepping already.
-Dope. My sister's on one of the teams.

39:01.300 --> 39:02.301
Look, Jace.

39:03.594 --> 39:04.761
I know what you did.

39:05.345 --> 39:06.430
You do?

39:07.514 --> 39:09.558
Phil hasn't been
getting along with his pops,

39:09.641 --> 39:11.059
and you guys covered for him.

39:11.977 --> 39:15.355
That's why your head wasn't right
the last game.

39:16.732 --> 39:19.902
Sometimes other things in life
feel more important than basketball.

39:21.361 --> 39:22.487
That okay?

39:22.571 --> 39:24.448
Yeah. Yeah, it is.

39:25.032 --> 39:27.201
Twenty-four-hour person, right, Coach?

39:27.784 --> 39:29.077
Right.

39:29.745 --> 39:33.040
Look, I just got some news
I haven't really had a chance to share.

39:33.123 --> 39:34.708
This COVID stuff is…

39:36.960 --> 39:39.254
It's gonna be
ending our season for a while.

39:39.338 --> 39:41.465
-For how long?
-I don't know.

39:42.341 --> 39:43.717
Maybe a few weeks.

39:43.800 --> 39:46.178
Nobody really seems
to know anything for sure.

39:46.261 --> 39:49.765
But we should know more answers tomorrow.

40:02.611 --> 40:04.905
It's Crystal Jarrett.
Sorry I missed your call,

40:04.988 --> 40:07.074
but why you callin'
when you can be ballin'?

40:08.700 --> 40:09.785
Yo, Crys.

40:11.745 --> 40:13.372
I'm at my sister's step show.

40:15.290 --> 40:17.125
Everything just feels crazy right now.

40:18.001 --> 40:21.547
Coach just said
we're shutting down our season, and…

40:25.300 --> 40:29.221
I just wanna say I'm sorry
if I upset you for doing what I did.

40:30.597 --> 40:32.891
If you don't wanna talk right now,
I get it.

40:35.185 --> 40:38.480
Just know I always got your back.

41:07.926 --> 41:11.763
That's my baby.
Show 'em what you workin' with!

41:17.102 --> 41:19.730
Jackie was supposed to be on
30 minutes ago.

41:21.273 --> 41:23.192
I gotta get to my color consultation.

41:23.275 --> 41:25.944
Tell Jackie I love her, and I'm sorry,

41:26.028 --> 41:28.697
and I'll watch her performance
on your phone. Record it for me.

41:28.780 --> 41:31.366
Come on, Mom. There's only one team left,
and then she gets on.

41:31.450 --> 41:33.493
I can't.
The district manager will be there.

41:33.577 --> 41:34.828
I can't keep her waiting.

41:35.662 --> 41:37.664
Bye, babe. Cheer good for me.

41:41.960 --> 41:43.253
Come on!

42:54.491 --> 42:56.702
Five, six, seven, eight.

42:57.828 --> 43:02.374
When the Step Queens hit the stage

43:02.457 --> 43:05.377
You know we 'bout to go off

43:05.460 --> 43:09.089
So sit back, relax
And watch us go hard

43:09.173 --> 43:13.218
If you move your eyes
You just might miss

43:13.302 --> 43:17.556
So hold on to your seats
There is no defeat

43:17.639 --> 43:21.643
When it come to queens
We cannot be beat

43:21.727 --> 43:22.728
What

43:45.626 --> 43:47.085
Go get it, Jackie!

43:47.669 --> 43:48.879
Yeah!

43:54.551 --> 43:55.552
Okay.

43:56.136 --> 43:57.304
All right.

44:01.850 --> 44:03.268
Go get it, Jackie!

44:06.522 --> 44:07.564
Let's go!

44:07.648 --> 44:09.483
I heard about your grandfather.

44:10.275 --> 44:12.819
Is he gonna be okay?

44:14.655 --> 44:15.489
It's…

44:15.989 --> 44:17.658
You know, doesn't look too good.

44:18.450 --> 44:19.451
I'm sorry.

44:20.035 --> 44:21.036
Thanks.

44:21.787 --> 44:24.373
And I hope you don't mind me calling.

44:24.456 --> 44:26.250
Nah, nah. It's cool. I just--

44:27.084 --> 44:28.752
I mean, I don't know,
I guess I'm a little surprised

44:28.836 --> 44:31.255
'cause you kinda ghosted me
after you went to my game.

44:31.338 --> 44:32.548
What?

44:32.631 --> 44:35.676
No, I tried to say bye to you
after that game.

44:35.759 --> 44:38.178
Wait. For real? I thought you just left.

44:38.262 --> 44:41.098
I wouldn't do that.
I was waving from the stands.

44:41.181 --> 44:42.307
I even yelled your name,

44:42.391 --> 44:44.685
but you were so in your feelings
that you didn't look up.

44:44.768 --> 44:45.936
Damn.

44:46.728 --> 44:49.731
Look, Tamika, I'm really sorry about that.

44:50.399 --> 44:51.567
It's okay.

44:52.901 --> 44:53.986
Are you a Cancer?

44:54.069 --> 44:56.989
Yeah, yeah. Cancer pride. What's up?

44:57.573 --> 44:59.157
You guys are moody.

45:00.826 --> 45:03.120
Wow. Okay. All right.

45:03.203 --> 45:06.748
But, I mean,
you have a good reason to be right now.

45:06.832 --> 45:09.543
My grandfather,
he would always tell me, you know,

45:09.626 --> 45:12.337
"In life, make sure
you live it to the fullest."

45:13.589 --> 45:16.508
So with that in mind
I got a little surprise for you.

45:17.092 --> 45:18.093
Really?

45:18.802 --> 45:21.680
Hey, Tamika
Butterflies every time I see ya

45:21.763 --> 45:23.974
Lookin' at you
Should be lookin' at the teacher

45:24.057 --> 45:26.476
But it's hard to focus
When I see your pretty features

45:26.560 --> 45:28.187
Your smile, warm as the bay

45:28.270 --> 45:30.480
I'm tryin' to kick it with you, queen
No, sensei

45:30.564 --> 45:32.900
You're so, so clean
And your heart full of grace

45:32.983 --> 45:35.485
Girl, you a shootin' star
And I want you in my space

45:35.569 --> 45:38.447
Yo, honestly? That was hella dope.

45:39.198 --> 45:41.575
Yes! Yes. Oh, my goodness.

45:41.658 --> 45:44.995
You know, I'm glad you like it
'cause that took me forever.

45:48.373 --> 45:51.585
As we are adjusting to the virus thing,

45:51.668 --> 45:53.754
I'll have to talk you through
the demonstrations.

45:54.546 --> 45:57.049
So, for the eye shadow,

45:57.132 --> 45:59.551
you wanna go from light to dark.

46:00.010 --> 46:01.136
Like this.

46:03.597 --> 46:04.598
Now you try.

46:14.358 --> 46:15.651
How could you do that, Mom?

46:17.361 --> 46:19.112
Jackie, I'm sure this can wait.

46:19.196 --> 46:21.949
So if it's not an issue with Jace,
it can wait. Is that it?

46:24.326 --> 46:26.703
It looks like you need your space.

46:27.496 --> 46:29.873
No, it's fine. My daughter was just going.

46:29.957 --> 46:31.917
No, Jenna. We're gonna end this.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.335
Good night, ladies.

46:36.421 --> 46:37.798
Thank you all for coming.

46:38.882 --> 46:39.925
All right.

46:42.636 --> 46:45.848
We'll continue this next week.
Look out for my email.

46:49.977 --> 46:52.271
I can't believe
you would embarrass me like that.

46:52.354 --> 46:55.732
It's bad enough
that most of my group canceled.

46:55.816 --> 46:57.818
And then you come in here
yelling like that?

46:57.901 --> 46:59.111
What's wrong with you?

46:59.194 --> 47:00.779
You promised me you would be there.

47:00.863 --> 47:03.323
I was there. Your show was late.

47:03.407 --> 47:04.491
So?

47:04.575 --> 47:08.203
-Tonight was important to me, Jackie.
-Tonight was important to me, Mom.

47:08.829 --> 47:10.914
All of my teammates had
their parents there,

47:10.998 --> 47:14.209
cheering and telling them
how good they did. Why not mine?

47:14.293 --> 47:15.711
Because I had to work.

47:16.378 --> 47:17.462
I finally found a way

47:17.546 --> 47:21.592
to help pay for the clothes,
the sneakers, the step show costumes,

47:21.675 --> 47:25.179
and all the things
my little gas company job can't cover.

47:25.262 --> 47:28.265
And for the first time,
I'm doing something I love.

47:28.348 --> 47:30.475
And you come in here
and throw a temper tantrum.

47:30.559 --> 47:32.186
Because you weren't there for me!

47:33.520 --> 47:38.066
But doing research for Jace's coach
and making sure he has scouts at the game.

47:38.150 --> 47:39.902
That is top priority, right?

47:42.321 --> 47:45.824
You would never leave Jace's game
for a stupid-ass meeting.

47:45.908 --> 47:48.160
You watch the way
you talk to me, little girl.

47:49.119 --> 47:51.788
I am the only one
doing shit around here for you.

47:51.872 --> 47:53.373
The only one.

48:12.559 --> 48:13.560
Hey.

48:15.229 --> 48:16.188
Hey.

48:18.273 --> 48:19.858
Feels like the world is ending.

48:20.609 --> 48:24.029
I know. And we may not be able
to come within six feet of each other.

48:26.490 --> 48:27.991
That would be nice, actually.

48:30.577 --> 48:31.662
You a fool.

48:34.998 --> 48:36.041
So, you okay?

48:37.125 --> 48:38.085
Me?

48:39.253 --> 48:40.838
I wanna know if you're okay.

48:40.921 --> 48:44.967
I talked to another teammate yesterday.

48:46.718 --> 48:49.847
Turns out our asshole coach was
messing with her too.

48:49.930 --> 48:51.598
Are you serious?

48:51.682 --> 48:52.683
Yeah.

48:58.397 --> 48:59.565
Well…

49:01.608 --> 49:03.986
I'm glad you found someone to talk to.

49:04.069 --> 49:05.195
It made me think.

49:05.779 --> 49:10.367
Why'd you beat him up if you knew
it could ruin everything for you?

49:20.252 --> 49:21.587
I just had to.
