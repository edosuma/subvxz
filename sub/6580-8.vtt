00:02.444 --> 00:06.147
<i></i>

00:06.149 --> 00:08.783
This is the main entrance,
though it's not really private.

00:08.785 --> 00:10.551
So this is where he's--
you can take a look.

00:10.553 --> 00:12.453
Hi.
Oh, my god.

00:12.455 --> 00:13.754
Is that really you?

00:13.756 --> 00:15.256
Aww.

00:15.258 --> 00:16.824
And look at you,

00:16.826 --> 00:18.225
Like you were never
even pregnant.

00:19.228 --> 00:20.494
How are your boobs
feeling?

00:20.496 --> 00:21.695
Besieged.

00:21.697 --> 00:23.030
That'll happen.
Mm-hmm.

00:24.400 --> 00:25.733
Cover this side.

00:26.936 --> 00:28.769
What's with all the suits?

00:28.771 --> 00:30.371
Some mucky-muck
flying into town

00:30.373 --> 00:31.739
For heart surgery.

00:31.741 --> 00:34.241
This is what they call
an advance team.

00:34.243 --> 00:35.810
And here i thought
you were rolling out

00:35.812 --> 00:37.011
The red carpet for me.

00:37.013 --> 00:38.112
Sorry.

00:38.114 --> 00:40.114
But i'm glad to see you.

00:40.116 --> 00:42.183
I'm surprised you didn't ask
for a couple more weeks.

00:42.185 --> 00:43.184
Well, it's been a month.

00:43.186 --> 00:44.351
I was just joking.

00:44.353 --> 00:46.153
You mean you don't think
i'm a bad mom?

00:46.155 --> 00:47.621
Juvie.
Respiratory distress.

00:47.623 --> 00:48.622
All right.

00:48.624 --> 00:49.890
Welcome back,
dr. Manning.

00:49.892 --> 00:50.891
Thank you.

00:50.893 --> 00:51.892
Trauma 2.

00:51.894 --> 00:53.260
I'll get your stuff.
Thanks.

00:53.262 --> 00:54.628
<i>- All tenens to the ed.</i>

00:54.630 --> 00:56.230
13-year-old female,
michelle.

00:56.232 --> 00:57.832
Worsened on the ride.
This is her father.

00:57.834 --> 01:00.000
Michelle, i'm dr. Manning.
I'm gonna take care of you.

01:00.002 --> 01:01.469
When did this start?
20 minutes ago.

01:01.471 --> 01:02.636
Is she asthmatic?
No.

01:02.638 --> 01:03.871
Bee sting?
Something she ate?

01:03.873 --> 01:05.306
Definitely not
something she ate.

01:05.308 --> 01:06.340
How can you be sure?

01:06.342 --> 01:07.675
Because she never
eats anything

01:07.677 --> 01:08.943
I don't prepare for her.

01:08.945 --> 01:10.711
All right, we're gonna
move her on my count.

01:10.713 --> 01:12.246
One, two, three.

01:14.383 --> 01:15.816
Call respiratory
for a vent, stat,

01:15.818 --> 01:17.017
And get a crash cart in here.

01:17.019 --> 01:18.919
Yes, dr. Manning.
She's in bronchospasm.

01:18.921 --> 01:20.387
Breathe, breathe.

01:20.389 --> 01:22.656
Draw up .3 milligrams of epi,
1/1000, and give it im.

01:22.658 --> 01:24.058
Got it.
I'm not sure that's safe.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.993
She's on other medications.
What medications?

01:25.995 --> 01:27.795
Metoprolol, and tegretol
for her seizures,

01:27.797 --> 01:29.330
Methadone for her pain--
methadone?

01:29.332 --> 01:30.631
She has mitochondrial disease.

01:30.633 --> 01:32.133
It affects her body's ability
to produce--

01:32.135 --> 01:33.701
I'm familiar with mito.
Stats are dropping.

01:33.703 --> 01:35.402
All right, we can't wait
for respiratory.

01:35.404 --> 01:36.704
We need to intubate.

01:36.706 --> 01:38.739
Get me 20 of etomidate,
80 of sux.

01:40.076 --> 01:41.742
She's spasmed down.
Where are the drugs?

01:41.744 --> 01:43.511
I lost the iv.
I'm trying again on this side.

01:43.513 --> 01:45.112
We don't have time.
We need to crich her.

01:45.114 --> 01:48.048
Get me a 10cc syringe
and a 16-gauge needle, now.

01:48.050 --> 01:49.950
What is happening?
Sir, i need you to step out.

01:49.952 --> 01:51.152
Don't tell me what to do.

01:51.154 --> 01:52.920
My daughter is dying
and you're letting her.

01:52.922 --> 01:54.054
Now!
Sir, step back.

01:54.056 --> 01:55.456
No, look--
it's all right, kiddo.

01:55.458 --> 01:56.924
Needle, now.
Here, doctor.

01:56.926 --> 01:58.626
Go ahead and hang
another liter.

01:58.628 --> 01:59.927
Stand by.

02:02.431 --> 02:03.430
I'm okay.

02:03.432 --> 02:04.698
I'm okay!

02:04.700 --> 02:06.333
Hold off.

02:08.738 --> 02:10.337
I'm okay.

02:12.375 --> 02:14.041
Sats are improving.

02:14.043 --> 02:15.743
Let's get a face mask on her.
Yes, doctor.

02:15.745 --> 02:17.444
Oh, thank god
you pulled out of it.

02:17.446 --> 02:19.180
Sorry i scared you, dad.

02:19.182 --> 02:20.181
Are you okay?

02:20.183 --> 02:21.182
Am<i> i</i> okay?

02:22.185 --> 02:24.818
Listen to you.

02:24.820 --> 02:27.488
Oh, you silly girl.

02:27.490 --> 02:29.089
Deep breaths,
deep breaths.

02:29.091 --> 02:31.559
I've never seen someone
improve like that so quick.

02:31.561 --> 02:32.560
You?

02:32.562 --> 02:35.095
No.

02:41.328 --> 02:41.360
.

02:43.497 --> 02:45.097
You had a g-tube implanted?

02:45.099 --> 02:46.499
Helps with her
nutrition.

02:46.501 --> 02:48.467
She's not the greatest eater.

02:48.469 --> 02:50.669
We iv her supplements
and vitamins.

02:50.671 --> 02:52.004
My smoothie.

02:52.006 --> 02:52.972
And the, uh...

02:52.974 --> 02:54.273
Central line catheter?

02:54.275 --> 02:55.808
It's for all her meds.

02:55.810 --> 02:57.777
Mm.

02:57.779 --> 02:59.045
She's good to go.

02:59.047 --> 03:01.013
You are a very brave girl.

03:01.015 --> 03:02.748
Got that from her mother.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.283
My wife died four years ago.

03:04.285 --> 03:05.418
Breast cancer.

03:05.420 --> 03:07.019
I'm sorry.

03:07.021 --> 03:08.554
Not long after that's
when kiddo here

03:08.556 --> 03:10.056
Started getting sick.

03:10.058 --> 03:11.524
Migraines, fatigue, ibs.

03:11.526 --> 03:12.525
For a while, i figured

03:12.527 --> 03:14.093
It was just part
of the mourning process,

03:14.095 --> 03:16.162
But it kept happening.

03:16.164 --> 03:17.430
I got that.

03:17.432 --> 03:20.299
I took her to--
i don't know how many doctors,

03:20.301 --> 03:21.901
But nobody knew what was wrong,

03:21.903 --> 03:23.269
So i went online

03:23.271 --> 03:24.870
And found out about mito.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.272
You went online for that?

03:26.274 --> 03:27.773
For the first time,

03:27.775 --> 03:30.376
What michelle was going through
finally made sense.

03:30.378 --> 03:32.111
Good news,
we know what it is.

03:32.113 --> 03:33.779
Bad news,
there's no cure.

03:33.781 --> 03:35.648
So we manage.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.116
Okay.

03:37.118 --> 03:38.384
Well, i'd like to do
a full workup

03:38.386 --> 03:39.552
Before discharging her.

03:39.554 --> 03:41.687
See if we can find
what caused those spasms.

03:41.689 --> 03:42.755
Could take a couple of hours.

03:42.757 --> 03:44.090
You guys okay with that?

03:44.092 --> 03:45.057
Do what you do.

03:45.059 --> 03:46.692
We're old pros.

03:46.694 --> 03:48.427
Never leave home unprepared,

03:48.429 --> 03:50.629
Just in case
we end up in the hospital.

03:53.468 --> 03:54.500
This way.

03:57.271 --> 04:00.339
Well, it looks like
royalty's arrived.

04:00.341 --> 04:03.642
You're referring to him...

04:03.644 --> 04:05.377
Or him?

04:05.379 --> 04:06.345
Princes come and go,

04:06.347 --> 04:08.914
But there's only one
king downey.

04:08.916 --> 04:09.949
Ah, yes,
your highness.

04:09.951 --> 04:11.117
Welcome.

04:11.119 --> 04:13.252
Guy's a surgical rock star.

04:13.254 --> 04:14.954
This prince flies halfway
around the world

04:14.956 --> 04:16.455
To have him replace his valve.

04:16.457 --> 04:17.656
This is the place
we want to be.

04:17.658 --> 04:18.691
Come on, your room's ready.

04:18.693 --> 04:21.861
Downey, number one
with a bullet.

04:21.863 --> 04:23.395
Although, i suppose
if that were true,

04:23.397 --> 04:26.465
You'd be yanking it out of him,
wouldn't you?

04:26.467 --> 04:27.600
Doctor rhodes,

04:27.602 --> 04:29.001
They're ready for you
in or 2.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.269
Thank you, maggie.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.273
This woman stabbed her husband
in the right flank

04:34.275 --> 04:35.641
With a pair of scissors.

04:35.643 --> 04:37.776
Sounds like they could use
a marriage counselor.

04:43.684 --> 04:45.484
Mr. Mason,

04:45.486 --> 04:47.219
I'm dr. Halstead.

04:47.221 --> 04:49.588
So, tell me,
when did this pain start?

04:54.061 --> 04:55.661
Who let this man
in the hospital?

04:55.663 --> 04:58.864
Who let this man
become a doctor?

04:58.866 --> 04:59.832
Whoa, gentlemen.

05:02.870 --> 05:04.436
I take it you two kids
know each other?

05:04.438 --> 05:05.738
I had the pleasure

05:05.740 --> 05:07.373
Of serving time on a carrier
with this man,

05:07.375 --> 05:09.074
Chief petty officer mason.

05:09.076 --> 05:10.276
Choi.

05:10.278 --> 05:11.877
Great to see you, chief.

05:11.879 --> 05:13.646
What are you doing in chicago?

05:13.648 --> 05:15.881
I retired two years ago,
and, uh...

05:15.883 --> 05:18.017
Let's catch up after we let
the doc here do his thing.

05:18.019 --> 05:18.984
Nothing doing.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.086
You come to chicago med,
you get me.

05:21.088 --> 05:22.688
Chart, please.

05:22.690 --> 05:24.790
You're in good hands.

05:24.792 --> 05:26.058
Honor to meet you.

05:28.996 --> 05:30.896
So...

05:30.898 --> 05:32.097
What brings you in here?

05:32.099 --> 05:33.732
I feel like
i swallowed a fishhook.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.336
Well, let's take a look.

05:41.442 --> 05:42.708
There you are.

05:42.710 --> 05:44.610
Heard you were back.
Hey.

05:44.612 --> 05:45.711
Hey.

05:45.713 --> 05:46.679
How's owen?

05:46.681 --> 05:48.747
He liking that mobile thing
i hung up?

05:48.749 --> 05:50.716
Mesmerized.
He can't stop staring at it.

05:50.718 --> 05:53.385
Success.

05:53.387 --> 05:54.987
Wasn't the same without you.

05:54.989 --> 05:56.155
I'm glad to be back.

05:56.157 --> 05:57.523
I just hope my son forgives me.

05:57.525 --> 05:58.490
Of course he will.

05:58.492 --> 06:00.292
Absence makes the heart
grow fonder.

06:00.294 --> 06:03.195
I'm not that absent.

06:03.197 --> 06:04.296
Oh, no, i didn't--

06:04.298 --> 06:05.598
I didn't mean any--

06:05.600 --> 06:06.799
I'm sorry;
i'm exhausted.

06:06.801 --> 06:09.101
I--it's just--
it's our first day apart.

06:09.103 --> 06:11.637
Absolutely.
First day.

06:11.639 --> 06:14.406
What's all this?

06:14.408 --> 06:17.009
My 13-year-old's
medical history.

06:17.011 --> 06:19.812
Dad keeps a copy of everything
in the car just in case.

06:19.814 --> 06:21.447
This is all
for a 13-year-old?

06:21.449 --> 06:23.048
Girl presents
with bronchospasm.

06:23.050 --> 06:24.483
I get this close
to criching her.

06:24.485 --> 06:26.352
The moment her father
leaves her side...

06:26.354 --> 06:27.886
she catches her breath.

06:27.888 --> 06:29.088
Like magic.

06:29.090 --> 06:30.856
The kid's
a budding harry potter.

06:30.858 --> 06:32.224
She has mitochondrial disease.

06:32.226 --> 06:33.259
Mito?

06:33.261 --> 06:35.027
We really are
talking fiction here.

06:35.029 --> 06:37.296
You don't think it exists?

06:37.298 --> 06:39.298
Always felt like
a wastebasket diagnosis to me.

06:39.300 --> 06:41.300
Doctor can't figure out
what's really going wrong,

06:41.302 --> 06:42.468
Says it's mito,
calls it a day.

06:42.470 --> 06:43.435
Hmm.

06:43.437 --> 06:44.703
What did
the muscle biopsy say?

06:44.705 --> 06:46.138
That i don't know,

06:46.140 --> 06:48.540
Because i haven't found it yet.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.675
Want a second set of eyes?

06:49.677 --> 06:52.111
Yes, thank you.

06:52.113 --> 06:53.412
You're welcome.

07:01.222 --> 07:02.655
Okay, here you go.
Okay. Yeah.

07:02.657 --> 07:04.290
Yeah.

07:04.292 --> 07:06.125
See you.
Okay, bye.

07:10.464 --> 07:12.798
Oh, my god.
You guys are so cute.

07:12.800 --> 07:13.966
We're just friends.

07:13.968 --> 07:14.933
Uh-huh.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.837
Another dating app?

07:18.839 --> 07:20.339
Why? You go to any bar,
and there's a line

07:20.341 --> 07:21.740
Around the block
to buy you a drink.

07:21.742 --> 07:24.009
Oh, well, at least
these guys know how to type,

07:24.011 --> 07:25.311
For the most part.

07:25.313 --> 07:26.278
Look at this one.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.048
Profile name,
"windy city winner."

07:29.050 --> 07:30.015
Nope.

07:31.619 --> 07:35.187
Another idiot without a shirt.

07:35.189 --> 07:36.588
Oh.

07:36.590 --> 07:37.923
That's...

07:40.294 --> 07:42.027
Joey.

07:42.029 --> 07:43.595
"cold tech, warm heart."

07:43.597 --> 07:45.264
It says his favorite thing is

07:45.266 --> 07:47.266
Watching the chicago skyline
at night

07:47.268 --> 07:48.867
From promontory point.

07:48.869 --> 07:51.470
Please, he hardly ever
leaves his computer.

07:52.807 --> 07:55.874
Hate to drag you two ladies
away from electronic romance...

07:55.876 --> 07:57.176
<i> Oh, my gosh!</i>
<i></i>

07:57.178 --> 07:58.277
But treatment five awaits.

07:58.279 --> 08:01.280

08:02.350 --> 08:04.350
Have fun.

08:08.055 --> 08:09.288
Okay.

08:09.290 --> 08:11.290
I need everything
to stop spinning.

08:11.292 --> 08:12.358
Okay.
You brought her in?

08:12.360 --> 08:13.359
Sloane's my girl.

08:13.361 --> 08:14.626
Ride or die
since junior high,

08:14.628 --> 08:15.961
And we're college roommates.

08:15.963 --> 08:17.696
She appears inebriated.

08:17.698 --> 08:19.231
I only had
two glasses of wine.

08:19.233 --> 08:20.733
She told me
she was staying in to study

08:20.735 --> 08:22.267
For her environmental studies
final.

08:22.269 --> 08:23.769
Soil bacteria.

08:23.771 --> 08:25.938
Yes, look--going over things
from her field trips.

08:25.940 --> 08:27.740
I'm so sorry, ames.

08:27.742 --> 08:30.376
Don't deserve you.
It's okay, sloaney.

08:30.378 --> 08:31.577
Her knee appears swollen.

08:31.579 --> 08:34.413
Well, she did fall
in the shower this morning.

08:34.415 --> 08:35.714
Well, often, in college,

08:35.716 --> 08:37.316
People find out
their actual limits,

08:37.318 --> 08:38.751
And she exceeded hers.

08:38.753 --> 08:40.085
You got wasted like this
a lot?

08:40.087 --> 08:41.887
No, not me.
Never once.

08:44.091 --> 08:45.290
Maybe once.

08:45.292 --> 08:47.926
All right, let's draw some labs,
start an iv,

08:47.928 --> 08:49.294
Get her on a liter
of normal saline,

08:49.296 --> 08:50.562
See if we can't sober her up.

08:50.564 --> 08:52.398
Yep.

08:54.402 --> 08:55.834
99.3.

08:55.836 --> 08:57.736
A little hot,
that's all.

08:57.738 --> 08:58.737
That's it?

08:58.739 --> 09:00.105
That, my friend, is it.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.274
You don't want to
run a cat scan or something?

09:02.276 --> 09:03.342
Cat scan?

09:03.344 --> 09:04.843
It's pretty standard,
isn't it?

09:04.845 --> 09:06.378
Not with what i'm seeing,

09:06.380 --> 09:08.380
Unless there's something
you haven't told me.

09:10.184 --> 09:12.451
When i go to the bathroom,

09:12.453 --> 09:13.952
There's blood in my stool.

09:17.291 --> 09:19.258
Blood.

09:19.260 --> 09:20.259
Bright red?
Dark?

09:20.261 --> 09:22.461
Dark.

09:22.463 --> 09:24.229
How long has that
been going on?

09:24.231 --> 09:25.497
About three months.

09:25.499 --> 09:27.399
And you're just
seeing a doctor now?

09:32.072 --> 09:33.372
Can you roll over
on your side?

09:36.210 --> 09:37.776
You know what's coming.

09:39.713 --> 09:42.047
But it'll just be
for a few seconds.

09:44.852 --> 09:47.686
We call this the chicago med
handshake.

09:52.493 --> 09:53.892
Okay, done.

09:56.597 --> 09:57.796
Chief,

09:57.798 --> 10:00.032
We are gonna do
that cat scan after all.

10:08.900 --> 10:08.932
.

10:11.403 --> 10:13.604
Not a scratch on the liver,
but a hole in the diaphragm.

10:13.606 --> 10:15.172
She got him good.

10:16.375 --> 10:17.608
Uh, doctor downey.

10:17.610 --> 10:19.943
Good morning.
What's he doing here?

10:19.945 --> 10:21.979
The patient, marty.

10:21.981 --> 10:24.448
<i></i>

10:24.450 --> 10:26.383
<i></i>

10:28.954 --> 10:30.220
Hmm.

10:30.222 --> 10:32.323
Do you know this patient?

10:32.325 --> 10:35.125
No.

10:39.165 --> 10:40.264
Ah.

10:40.266 --> 10:41.865
Are there any concerns,
dr. Downey?

10:41.867 --> 10:43.467
No.

10:46.772 --> 10:51.375
And we are...Done.

10:55.214 --> 10:56.180
What did he want?

10:56.182 --> 10:58.082
I have no idea.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.624
Excuse me.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.793
Excuse me.

11:09.795 --> 11:11.028
Sorry.

11:11.030 --> 11:12.963
It's a fricking
rose bowl parade in here.

11:12.965 --> 11:16.200
Well, the prince
has a lot of well-wishers.

11:16.202 --> 11:18.836
Is he gifting david
a polo pony this time?

11:18.838 --> 11:20.671
I thought i saw
a saddle back there.

11:20.673 --> 11:22.740
Do i sense a tinge
of jealousy,

11:22.742 --> 11:23.707
Or are you just upset

11:23.709 --> 11:25.676
Because i let him use
your parking spot?

11:25.678 --> 11:26.910
Look, hawaiian shirts aside,

11:26.912 --> 11:29.046
I think david is a lovely man.

11:29.048 --> 11:32.015
It's, frankly, our priorities
that i tend to question.

11:32.017 --> 11:33.917
Look at this ed, daniel.

11:33.919 --> 11:36.787
You don't get this
without that.

11:36.789 --> 11:40.257
Downey helps make chicago med
a destination hospital.

11:40.259 --> 11:42.226
Yeah, like disneyland.

11:44.530 --> 11:45.963
Right?

11:48.033 --> 11:49.800
Hi, michelle.

11:49.802 --> 11:50.901
How are you feeling?

11:50.903 --> 11:53.137
Well...
Not great, to be honest.

11:53.139 --> 11:55.439
I'm wondering if we should
adjust her iv fluids?

11:55.441 --> 11:57.274
Okay.
Well, we'll look into that.

11:57.276 --> 12:00.010
This is dr. Halstead;
i've asked him to join us.

12:00.012 --> 12:01.345
Thank you,
by the way, for keeping

12:01.347 --> 12:03.414
Such a detailed account
of michelle's history.

12:03.416 --> 12:06.550
Yeah, well, sometimes
it feels like a full-time job.

12:06.552 --> 12:08.051
I bet.

12:08.053 --> 12:09.686
Well, we were looking over
her records

12:09.688 --> 12:12.723
And didn't come across
any results for a muscle biopsy.

12:12.725 --> 12:15.025
Do you know if one
was ever performed?

12:15.027 --> 12:16.160
No, we haven't done a biopsy.

12:16.162 --> 12:17.494
Uh-huh.

12:17.496 --> 12:19.196
I highly recommend one.

12:19.198 --> 12:22.633
It's really the only way
to confirm a diagnosis of mito.

12:22.635 --> 12:24.635
Well, no,
the doctor was concerned

12:24.637 --> 12:27.004
How michelle would react
to the anesthesia.

12:27.006 --> 12:28.305
What's he talking about,
daddy?

12:28.307 --> 12:30.707
Nothing, kiddo.

12:30.709 --> 12:33.177
You know, she should rest.

12:33.179 --> 12:35.446
I'll be right outside.

12:35.448 --> 12:36.713
Can we chat outside?

12:43.055 --> 12:44.254
What are you doing?

12:44.256 --> 12:46.457
Just trying to confirm--
michelle has mito.

12:46.459 --> 12:48.592
If i wanted her retested,
i'd ask.

12:48.594 --> 12:50.661
I came here because she was
having trouble breathing

12:50.663 --> 12:52.029
And this was
the closest hospital.

12:52.031 --> 12:53.664
I didn't come here
to debate her diagnosis.

12:53.666 --> 12:54.865
We're just trying
to find a way

12:54.867 --> 12:56.600
To help your daughter start
feeling better.

12:56.602 --> 12:59.503
No, dr. Halstead thinks
he knows better than her father.

12:59.505 --> 13:01.638
I was not questioning--
oh, the hell you weren't.

13:01.640 --> 13:03.307
Daddy?

13:03.309 --> 13:06.210
My stomach...

13:06.212 --> 13:07.177
Michelle?

13:07.179 --> 13:08.278
Are you okay?

13:08.280 --> 13:09.880
Pulse is strong.
Pupils are equal.

13:09.882 --> 13:10.948
Iv?

13:10.950 --> 13:12.483
It's good.
April, ammonia ampule.

13:12.485 --> 13:14.084
Got it.
Anything you need?

13:14.086 --> 13:15.085
Thanks, we got it.

13:15.087 --> 13:17.588
We need to take a look
at that hand.

13:17.590 --> 13:18.655
Do something.

13:18.657 --> 13:19.957
Dr. Halstead.

13:19.959 --> 13:21.191
Thank you.

13:24.296 --> 13:25.462
michelle?

13:25.464 --> 13:28.332
okay, michelle?

13:28.334 --> 13:29.333
It's okay, kiddo.

13:29.335 --> 13:30.434
It's okay.

13:30.436 --> 13:31.635
I'm here.
Daddy's right here.

13:31.637 --> 13:33.070
daddy!

13:33.072 --> 13:34.538
Yeah.

13:34.540 --> 13:36.039
You still want to
convince yourselves

13:36.041 --> 13:37.407
There's nothing wrong with her?

13:43.682 --> 13:45.682
I'm guessing,
by your expression,

13:45.684 --> 13:48.652
It doesn't look good.

13:48.654 --> 13:50.420
It doesn't.

13:50.422 --> 13:51.588
You have a large mass

13:51.590 --> 13:53.423
Partially obstructing
your right colon,

13:53.425 --> 13:57.060
Which explains the symptoms
you've been experiencing.

13:57.062 --> 13:59.730
I can't be sure, but...

13:59.732 --> 14:00.697
In all likelihood, i--

14:00.699 --> 14:03.333
Colon cancer, right?

14:03.335 --> 14:04.468
My doctor at the va,

14:04.470 --> 14:05.903
She thought this might
be what it was.

14:05.905 --> 14:07.337
Wait, you have a doctor
at the va

14:07.339 --> 14:09.406
Who knew your symptoms
and hasn't had you scanned yet?

14:09.408 --> 14:12.109
Dr. Glass, but it--
it wasn't her fault, okay?

14:12.111 --> 14:13.977
She's been beating the drum
for me.

14:13.979 --> 14:16.747
it's that va.

14:16.749 --> 14:19.283
They got their own special pace.

14:19.285 --> 14:20.817
Slow.

14:20.819 --> 14:22.152
Hey,

14:22.154 --> 14:24.421
You think i'll make it
another week?

14:26.258 --> 14:27.691
What happens in a week?

14:27.693 --> 14:29.660
Reunion.

14:29.662 --> 14:31.495
You know, all the chiefs
from the vinson

14:31.497 --> 14:32.896
Who were deployed to haiti,

14:32.898 --> 14:35.232
Helping out after the quake.

14:35.234 --> 14:38.035
I remember.

14:38.037 --> 14:40.237
You'll be at that reunion,
chief.

14:49.381 --> 14:51.982
How's that feel?
Is that okay, michelle?

14:51.984 --> 14:54.284
How's your stomach
feeling now?

14:54.286 --> 14:55.519
A little better.

14:55.521 --> 14:58.221
It never feels great,
though.

14:58.223 --> 15:00.958
That's why i'm so lucky
to have my dad.

15:00.960 --> 15:02.626
He's always there
to take care of me.

15:02.628 --> 15:04.895
Now, where else
would i be, kiddo?

15:12.438 --> 15:14.171
Hey.

15:14.173 --> 15:16.306
How's that, uh...

15:16.308 --> 15:17.474
Young lady doing?

15:17.476 --> 15:19.910
I wish there was
a simple answer to that.

15:19.912 --> 15:21.678
How about the un-simple one?

15:25.050 --> 15:27.417
So something's clearly
wrong with her,

15:27.419 --> 15:28.418
But mito?

15:28.420 --> 15:29.453
I'm not buying it.

15:29.455 --> 15:31.588
Could it just be
all the medication?

15:31.590 --> 15:33.023
The girl's
a walking pharmacy.

15:33.025 --> 15:35.492
Who knows how she's reacting
to all those drugs?

15:35.494 --> 15:37.461
Ideally, i'd wean michelle
off everything

15:37.463 --> 15:38.595
And establish a new baseline.

15:38.597 --> 15:39.997
You think the dad
would go for that?

15:39.999 --> 15:41.398
Not a chance.

15:41.400 --> 15:44.701
The guy is dead set
it's mito.

15:44.703 --> 15:46.403
I--i got a weird feeling
here, doc.

15:46.405 --> 15:47.871
It--it's like...

15:47.873 --> 15:50.207
They've built their lives
around this disease.

15:50.209 --> 15:52.843
Huh.

15:52.845 --> 15:54.411
I don't know, will.

15:54.413 --> 15:57.280
It feels like something
worth investigating to me.

15:57.282 --> 15:59.082
Yeah, i think it'd be great

15:59.084 --> 16:00.250
If you went
and talked to them.

16:00.252 --> 16:02.185
What, i walk in there?
A shrink?

16:02.187 --> 16:03.954
No, it'd change
the whole dynamic.

16:03.956 --> 16:05.822
You'd never get a clean read.

16:05.824 --> 16:07.257
I need to watch them

16:07.259 --> 16:08.925
Without them knowing
i'm watching them.

16:08.927 --> 16:11.862
<i></i>

16:14.199 --> 16:16.033
Dr. Rhodes, your presence
has been requested

16:16.035 --> 16:17.467
On the fifth floor.

16:17.469 --> 16:19.369
Dr. Downey wants
to speak with you.

16:23.008 --> 16:24.741
Yeah, yeah,
i'll come up.

16:24.743 --> 16:27.010
He'll be right up.

16:27.012 --> 16:30.013
Well, let me know
what he wants.

16:30.015 --> 16:31.148
Yeah.

16:33.452 --> 16:34.618
Hey--

16:35.587 --> 16:37.287
How's our patient in five?

16:37.289 --> 16:39.423
Still sleeping it off.

16:39.425 --> 16:41.658
Um...About that profile?

16:41.660 --> 16:42.926
I'm wondering if it's something

16:42.928 --> 16:45.362
Joey just had up
and forgot to take down.

16:45.364 --> 16:46.930
Does it say the last time
he was on?

16:46.932 --> 16:49.299
Mm...

16:49.301 --> 16:53.103
He was last active...

16:53.105 --> 16:54.271
Today.

16:54.273 --> 16:55.739
Today?
Mm-hmm.

16:55.741 --> 16:57.040
Excuse me.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.909
I had a question
i wanted to ask you.

16:58.911 --> 17:00.677
What's it like
being a doctor?

17:00.679 --> 17:02.412
Oh, not a doctor.
Fourth-year med student.

17:02.414 --> 17:03.714
Oh, i'm premed.

17:03.716 --> 17:05.515
Does the work load
ever calm down?

17:05.517 --> 17:07.050
No, just gets worse.

17:07.052 --> 17:09.886
Miles, my boyfriend,
is about ready to dump my ass.

17:09.888 --> 17:12.155
Last night, he begs me
to go see some band at metro,

17:12.157 --> 17:13.957
And i blew him off to study.

17:13.959 --> 17:18.061
Well, in my experience,
med school and guys don't mix.

17:18.063 --> 17:19.763
Most of them
are liars and cheats anyway.

17:19.765 --> 17:21.331
You say,
"let's take it slow,"

17:21.333 --> 17:23.366
And for them, that means
a license to sleep around.

17:24.770 --> 17:26.269
<i>- Seizure in five!</i>

17:28.173 --> 17:29.906
<i></i>

17:32.311 --> 17:34.578
Get one milligram of ativan,
and grab the attending.

17:34.580 --> 17:36.513
Thank you.
I've got her airway.

17:36.515 --> 17:39.015
Oh, my god.

17:39.017 --> 17:40.817
Have you ever seen her
have a seizure before?

17:40.819 --> 17:42.519
No.

17:42.521 --> 17:43.720
Where's that ativan?

17:50.496 --> 17:51.928
How often does she
drink like this?

17:51.930 --> 17:53.263
Is it possible
she's detoxing?

17:53.265 --> 17:54.731
No way
sloane's a closet alkie.

17:54.733 --> 17:56.266
We don't keep secrets
from each other.

17:56.268 --> 17:57.801
All of this
from one night of drinking

17:57.803 --> 17:59.736
Doesn't make sense.

18:07.503 --> 18:07.536
.

18:08.438 --> 18:11.440
<i></i>

18:11.442 --> 18:13.709
Dr. Rhodes.

18:13.711 --> 18:16.878
Nice work down there.

18:16.880 --> 18:18.113
Thank you.

18:18.115 --> 18:22.050
So my angels tell me

18:22.052 --> 18:23.185
You spent time in riyadh?

18:23.187 --> 18:25.520
Your angels are correct.

18:25.522 --> 18:28.490
I was there last year
helping injured oil workers.

18:28.492 --> 18:29.891
How's your arabic?

18:31.462 --> 18:32.527
Sounds good to me.

18:32.529 --> 18:34.529
Come on, i want you
to meet somebody.

18:42.272 --> 18:45.340
So here it is.

18:45.342 --> 18:46.508
Hyponatremia?

18:46.510 --> 18:48.176
Yeah, her sodium levels
are pretty low.

18:48.178 --> 18:49.978
119.

18:53.550 --> 18:54.549
Her...

18:55.619 --> 18:58.086
Glucose is 74,
so she's not diabetic.

18:58.088 --> 18:59.254
Her blood alcohol is negative.

18:59.256 --> 19:00.255
What caused her--
hey.

19:00.257 --> 19:01.623
Her seizure?

19:01.625 --> 19:02.958
Is everything okay?

19:02.960 --> 19:04.493
You know, with us?

19:08.332 --> 19:10.132
You on that app too?

19:10.134 --> 19:11.733
What?
No.

19:11.735 --> 19:13.001
What are you doing on it?

19:13.003 --> 19:14.036
I mean...

19:14.038 --> 19:15.437
You said you like
to take it slow

19:15.439 --> 19:16.805
And get to know a person.

19:16.807 --> 19:18.040
Yeah, get to know
one person,

19:18.042 --> 19:20.475
Not get to know me
while you date half of chicago.

19:20.477 --> 19:21.643
No,
i'm not dating half of--

19:21.645 --> 19:24.479
And the chicago skyline?

19:24.481 --> 19:26.915
When's the last time
you were even outside at night?

19:31.522 --> 19:33.655
There'll be a pulmonary
thromboendarterectomy,

19:33.657 --> 19:35.624
Full bypass,
hemodilution.

19:35.626 --> 19:36.892
Now, i like it
because it gives us

19:36.894 --> 19:40.162
A clear field, so we can
completely remove the blockage.

19:40.164 --> 19:42.364
Would you like me
to translate this into arabic?

19:42.366 --> 19:45.100
Why would you need to do that?

19:45.102 --> 19:47.202
I see that i don't.

19:47.204 --> 19:49.538
So surgery's set for 3:00.

19:49.540 --> 19:53.141
Make yourself comfortable
while my team preps.

19:53.143 --> 19:55.510
Stop worrying.

19:57.047 --> 19:58.613
You're making me nervous.

19:58.615 --> 20:01.783
You certainly don't want that
while i'm operating.

20:01.785 --> 20:03.218
We'll see you in a bit.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.325
I'm not a ct surgeon,

20:10.327 --> 20:12.194
But bypass
for pulmonary thrombus

20:12.196 --> 20:14.062
Isn't common, is it?

20:14.064 --> 20:16.164
Who wants common?
I know my patient doesn't.

20:16.166 --> 20:17.232
You okay with common?

20:17.234 --> 20:19.234
Dr. Downey, what exactly
am i doing here?

20:19.236 --> 20:21.203
You're helping me
prep for surgery.

20:23.373 --> 20:25.273
I guess so.

20:25.275 --> 20:27.209
Did he eat?

20:27.211 --> 20:29.244
Oh, okay, good.
Good.

20:29.246 --> 20:31.379
And you're sure
you have enough milk?

20:31.381 --> 20:33.014
Okay, because you know,
i'm really close;

20:33.016 --> 20:35.617
I could always come...

20:35.619 --> 20:37.018
Okay.

20:37.020 --> 20:39.054
All right, well,
call me if you need anything.

20:39.056 --> 20:40.255
You know, i'm, um...

20:40.257 --> 20:43.091
Just ten minutes away.

20:43.093 --> 20:44.893
I'll call you
in a little bit, okay?

20:44.895 --> 20:46.528
Give owen a kiss for me.

20:46.530 --> 20:47.829
Okay, bye.

20:49.466 --> 20:50.999
There's something
you need to see.

20:55.639 --> 20:57.873
<i> That feel okay?</i>

20:57.875 --> 20:59.441
<i>Do you need anything?</i>

20:59.443 --> 21:01.409
<i>- No, water's fi</i>

21:01.411 --> 21:03.345
Notice how normal she is
with april,

21:03.347 --> 21:05.447
And then--and then
her dad walks in.

21:05.449 --> 21:08.250
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>How you doing, kiddo?</i>

21:08.252 --> 21:10.252
<i>- Hanging in the</i>

21:10.254 --> 21:12.154
And her smile disappears.

21:12.156 --> 21:13.822
<i>- Hey, dad.</i>

21:13.824 --> 21:15.724
<i>I can't hold that cup.</i>

21:15.726 --> 21:16.758
<i>Can you bring it</i>

21:16.760 --> 21:18.260
<i>- Of course, sweetheart.</i>

21:18.262 --> 21:19.928
See, so before,
she's drinking on her own,

21:19.930 --> 21:22.030
And now, all of a sudden,
she needs her dad's help.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.767
It's like she's instantly
self-infantilizing.

21:25.769 --> 21:27.435
Why would you do this?

21:27.437 --> 21:28.503
Because i asked him to.

21:28.505 --> 21:29.838
Without consulting me?

21:29.840 --> 21:31.673
This is my patient.

21:31.675 --> 21:33.441
You know, i ought to
haul your ass up

21:33.443 --> 21:35.443
In front of the ethics
committee.

21:35.445 --> 21:37.712
This is an absolute violation
of patient rights,

21:37.714 --> 21:38.680
And you know that.

21:38.682 --> 21:40.248
I do, sharon,

21:40.250 --> 21:41.449
But we could be
looking at a case

21:41.451 --> 21:42.651
Of medical child abuse here.

21:42.653 --> 21:43.919
Child abuse?

21:43.921 --> 21:45.287
Mr. Joffe is overbearing,

21:45.289 --> 21:47.189
But he's clearly not intending
to hurt michelle.

21:47.191 --> 21:48.156
Of course not.

21:48.158 --> 21:49.758
He's trying to save her,

21:49.760 --> 21:52.060
But that's precisely why
we would refer to this

21:52.062 --> 21:53.795
As a conversion disorder.

21:53.797 --> 21:55.764
My gut is telling me

21:55.766 --> 21:59.000
This entire relationship
is driven by her being sick

21:59.002 --> 22:00.402
And him taking care of her.

22:00.404 --> 22:01.903
Hold on.

22:01.905 --> 22:03.271
Even if it's not mito,

22:03.273 --> 22:06.107
Her symptoms could still
be explained by something else.

22:06.109 --> 22:08.543
A chiari malformation, maybe?

22:08.545 --> 22:10.412
Before i call this guy
an abuser,

22:10.414 --> 22:12.447
I want to
rule everything else out.

22:12.449 --> 22:13.815
As soon as michelle can stand,

22:13.817 --> 22:15.984
He's gonna take her home,
and then we're out of options.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.819
Okay.

22:17.821 --> 22:20.856
You erase that footage
immediately.

22:20.858 --> 22:23.391
Dr. Manning,
i understand how you feel,

22:23.393 --> 22:26.194
And i want you to run whatever
tests you deem necessary

22:26.196 --> 22:28.096
To narrow your differential
diagnosis;

22:28.098 --> 22:32.667
However, if there is even
a 1% chance of abuse

22:32.669 --> 22:35.136
Taking place,
we have an obligation here.

22:35.138 --> 22:39.374
So what do you need
to make a clear call?

22:39.376 --> 22:43.245
I need to talk with michelle
without her father present.

22:44.481 --> 22:45.947
All right.

22:45.949 --> 22:47.983
This is how
we're gonna make that happen.

22:50.487 --> 22:52.220
All right, michelle.

22:52.222 --> 22:54.356
Here's the mri machine
we're gonna be using.

22:54.358 --> 22:57.492
It's still warming up,
but we have dr. Charles here

22:57.494 --> 22:59.427
To keep us company
until it's ready.

22:59.429 --> 23:01.129
Are you okay with that?

23:01.131 --> 23:02.330
Hi, michelle.

23:02.332 --> 23:04.132
Hi.

23:04.134 --> 23:06.167
What kind of doctor are you?

23:06.169 --> 23:09.037
I am the kind of doctor

23:09.039 --> 23:11.873
Whose job it is to make sure
you don't get nervous

23:11.875 --> 23:14.109
About getting in that machine.

23:14.111 --> 23:15.443
I'm not scared.

23:15.445 --> 23:17.479
I'm used to this kind of stuff.

23:17.481 --> 23:19.614
Me and my dad are in hospitals
all the time.

23:19.616 --> 23:21.383
Hmm.

23:21.385 --> 23:22.984
Well, we're hoping to
make it so that

23:22.986 --> 23:24.986
You don't have to be
in them so much.

23:24.988 --> 23:26.187
How does that sound?

23:28.025 --> 23:29.925
Okay.

23:29.927 --> 23:31.459
Good.

23:38.335 --> 23:41.436
Six teaspoons
of gunpowder green tea.

23:41.438 --> 23:42.971
Boiling water.

23:45.075 --> 23:47.943
<i></i>

23:49.947 --> 23:52.981
<i></i>

23:54.785 --> 23:55.817
Gently.

23:55.819 --> 23:57.619
Arabic tea.

23:57.621 --> 23:59.587
This helps you prep for surgery?

24:01.692 --> 24:05.393
Swirl.

24:05.395 --> 24:08.296
Pour.

24:08.298 --> 24:10.932
Make sure the tea
stays in the pot.

24:17.941 --> 24:19.641
Sugar.

24:23.013 --> 24:24.846
Mint.

24:25.849 --> 24:27.315
Stir.

24:31.021 --> 24:33.855
Slowly.

24:33.857 --> 24:37.225
Don't want to change
the viscosity.

24:37.227 --> 24:38.960
Viscosity?

24:40.831 --> 24:42.897
Wait; that's why
you use hemodilution

24:42.899 --> 24:45.867
To allow bypass
without reperfusion injury?

24:47.137 --> 24:49.270
Should be done.

24:52.109 --> 24:53.174
Tea with mint.

24:53.176 --> 24:56.011
That's moroccan, not saudi.

24:56.013 --> 24:59.647
It's not for the prince.

24:59.649 --> 25:00.915
Thank you, dr. Rhodes.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.283
You can go.

25:02.285 --> 25:03.752
That's it?

25:06.089 --> 25:07.822
You did a nice job.

25:07.824 --> 25:10.792
<i></i>

25:21.538 --> 25:25.440
I remember dad got tickets
to a play that day, "wicked."

25:25.442 --> 25:27.876
Oh, my daughter wanted me
to take her to that.

25:27.878 --> 25:28.910
Was it good?

25:28.912 --> 25:31.179
I don't know;
i never saw it.

25:31.181 --> 25:34.682
I went into my dad's room
to see if he was ready,

25:34.684 --> 25:36.651
But he was looking
at pictures of my mom

25:36.653 --> 25:39.354
And being sad, so...

25:39.356 --> 25:42.323
I went back to my room.

25:42.325 --> 25:43.792
Then what happened?

25:49.866 --> 25:51.433
I have got to confess,

25:51.435 --> 25:54.469
I am so jealous
of those socks.

25:54.471 --> 25:57.572
Those hedgehogs are fantastic.

25:57.574 --> 25:59.741
Okay, so you went back
to your room,

25:59.743 --> 26:01.576
And...

26:03.146 --> 26:05.713
Oh, i just waited

26:05.715 --> 26:07.549
For a long time,

26:07.551 --> 26:10.085
And then my stomach
started to hurt,

26:10.087 --> 26:11.119
And i got dizzy,

26:11.121 --> 26:12.687
And i yelled out for my dad,

26:12.689 --> 26:14.656
And then...

26:14.658 --> 26:16.458
And he came?

26:16.460 --> 26:18.426
Yeah, he came.

26:18.428 --> 26:21.963
He picked me up
and took me to the hospital.

26:21.965 --> 26:25.733
Since then,
it's been like this a lot.

26:25.735 --> 26:27.102
And how's your dad been doing?

26:27.104 --> 26:29.270
Does, uh--
does he still get sad?

26:29.272 --> 26:32.540
Not so much.

26:32.542 --> 26:36.211
I guess
i keep him pretty busy.

26:36.213 --> 26:39.647
Makes sense.

26:39.649 --> 26:40.648
So.

26:40.650 --> 26:42.717
We, uh...We good?

26:42.719 --> 26:44.686
We should be all set.

26:44.688 --> 26:45.820
Thank you, mr. Joffe.

26:45.822 --> 26:50.191
Now, if you can sign
just three more forms,

26:50.193 --> 26:52.794
I promise you'll be done.

26:52.796 --> 26:54.796
Dr. Manning's
been down in radiology

26:54.798 --> 26:56.965
With my daughter
for over an hour.

26:56.967 --> 26:58.633
Would you like me
to page her?

26:58.635 --> 26:59.868
No.

26:59.870 --> 27:01.236
I'll just go down there.

27:01.238 --> 27:02.737
Oh, i'm sorry,
you can't be in the room

27:02.739 --> 27:04.305
While your daughter's
having an mri.

27:04.307 --> 27:05.473
Yeah,
that's what she said,

27:05.475 --> 27:07.709
But i'm not waiting around
anymore.

27:07.711 --> 27:08.910
Mr. Joffe?

27:08.912 --> 27:10.345
I'm dr. Charles.

27:10.347 --> 27:11.846
Could i talk to you
for a second?

27:11.848 --> 27:12.847
Yeah, why?

27:12.849 --> 27:14.149
Well,
it's about your daughter.

27:14.151 --> 27:15.850
There's a consultation room
right over here

27:15.852 --> 27:16.951
If you have a couple minutes.

27:16.953 --> 27:17.986
No, you know what?

27:17.988 --> 27:19.120
If you have something to say,

27:19.122 --> 27:20.955
Can you just say it?

27:20.957 --> 27:23.124
There is a strong possibility

27:23.126 --> 27:25.193
That your daughter's
medical issues

27:25.195 --> 27:27.762
Have a psychological
component to them.

27:27.764 --> 27:29.197
What the hell
are you talking about?

27:29.199 --> 27:30.999
It's very important
that you understand that

27:31.001 --> 27:32.901
I wouldn't be telling you this
unless i perceived

27:32.903 --> 27:35.703
Significant risk
to both you and your daughter,

27:35.705 --> 27:37.572
But i want you
to consider the possibility

27:37.574 --> 27:39.007
That when your wife died,

27:39.009 --> 27:40.608
Your daughter
might have misunderstood

27:40.610 --> 27:43.511
Your attempts to protect her
from your grief.

27:43.513 --> 27:46.281
Her isolation--
wait, what?

27:46.283 --> 27:48.149
So i've been making her sick?

27:48.151 --> 27:49.584
That's what you're
accusing me of?

27:49.586 --> 27:51.152
It's much more complicated
than that.

27:51.154 --> 27:52.754
No, but it's my fault.
I'm to blame.

27:52.756 --> 27:54.255
That's actually
not what i'm saying.

27:54.257 --> 27:55.256
If you'd hear me out--

27:55.258 --> 27:56.491
I cannot believe you people.

27:56.493 --> 27:58.593
I am not going to stand here
and listen to this.

27:58.595 --> 28:01.329
I'm going to get my daughter
and get here out of here.

28:06.269 --> 28:08.269
<i>Michelle!</i>

28:08.271 --> 28:10.338
Excuse me,
my daughter's having an mri.

28:10.340 --> 28:12.907
Where is that?
Right over there, sir.

28:12.909 --> 28:13.975
Where's my daughter?

28:13.977 --> 28:15.910
She's still
in the mri machine.

28:15.912 --> 28:17.612
Well, turn it off.
I'm taking her home now.

28:17.614 --> 28:19.047
I'm sorry, sir,
but we can't do that.

28:19.049 --> 28:20.515
No, please--
mr. Joffe!

28:21.585 --> 28:23.017
Please, mr. Joffe.
Open this door.

28:23.019 --> 28:24.652
Please, mr. Joffe.
Open this door!

28:24.654 --> 28:26.054
Mr. Joffe?
Madeline gastern.

28:26.056 --> 28:28.556
We are from the department
of child and family services.

28:28.558 --> 28:30.191
What the hell
is going on here?

28:30.193 --> 28:31.826
A charge
of medical child abuse

28:31.828 --> 28:33.828
Has been brought against you
by this hospital.

28:33.830 --> 28:34.963
Child abuse?

28:34.965 --> 28:36.731
That is a legal term only,
mr. Joffe--

28:36.733 --> 28:38.666
Michelle will be taken
into custody by the state

28:38.668 --> 28:40.401
While the charge
is investigated.

28:40.403 --> 28:41.669
What are you talking about?

28:41.671 --> 28:43.805
I'm sorry;
i know this must be confusing,

28:43.807 --> 28:46.074
But we need to sit down
with you and explain

28:46.076 --> 28:47.609
Why this has happened.

28:49.679 --> 28:51.479
You.
You set this up, didn't you?

28:51.481 --> 28:52.680
No--
shame on you.

28:52.682 --> 28:54.782
Mr. Joffe--
you...

28:54.784 --> 28:57.819
Stay away from me.

28:57.821 --> 28:58.820
Let me tell you something.

28:58.822 --> 29:01.155
You people have
picked the wrong battle.

29:01.157 --> 29:04.158
<i></i>

29:10.207 --> 29:10.239
.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.075
Dr. Ethan choi
from chicago med.

29:13.077 --> 29:14.577
I've left a few messages
for dr. Glass.

29:14.579 --> 29:16.111
We have a patient of hers here
who needs--

29:16.113 --> 29:17.713
Please don't put me
on hold again.

29:17.715 --> 29:19.582
I'm aware of that, but--

29:20.651 --> 29:22.551
Unbelievable.

29:22.553 --> 29:24.320
Maggie, i'm taking an hour
of personal time.

29:24.322 --> 29:26.021
I wouldn't do it
if it wasn't important.

29:26.023 --> 29:27.523
Why are you still here?

29:28.726 --> 29:30.859
Hey, heard one of your
old shipmates was here.

29:30.861 --> 29:31.994
How's he doing?
Not good.

29:31.996 --> 29:33.562
I'm headed to the va
to crack some heads.

29:33.564 --> 29:35.197
You want me to come with?
Power in numbers?

29:35.199 --> 29:37.233
I'll be okay.
Thanks.

29:43.708 --> 29:44.940
You look a little lost.

29:44.942 --> 29:47.209
I'm not sure what's going on
with my patient.

29:47.211 --> 29:49.945
Her labs are inconsistent
with how she presents.

29:49.947 --> 29:51.947
Whenever i get confused,
i always go back

29:51.949 --> 29:53.482
To the history
and the physical.

29:53.484 --> 29:55.317
It's the best place
to find answers.

30:00.024 --> 30:02.157
I need to know everything
you ate and drank last night.

30:02.159 --> 30:03.125
I already told you.

30:03.127 --> 30:04.426
Two glasses of white wine.

30:04.428 --> 30:05.761
That's it.

30:05.763 --> 30:08.230
And a ton of water
'cause i didn't want a hangover.

30:08.232 --> 30:09.331
What's a "ton"?

30:09.333 --> 30:12.268
Like, six or seven
of those bottled waters.

30:12.270 --> 30:14.136
I would have had more
if it wasn't so expensive.

30:14.138 --> 30:16.705
Expensive?
You said you were at home.

30:16.707 --> 30:18.507
I was.
What is this?

30:21.312 --> 30:23.646
"metro"?
Were you there last night?

30:23.648 --> 30:24.613
No.

30:24.615 --> 30:26.849
You went to metro?

30:26.851 --> 30:27.983
Oh, my god.

30:27.985 --> 30:29.985
You were there with miles,
weren't you?

30:29.987 --> 30:31.520
Did you hook up with him?

30:34.392 --> 30:35.624
Oh, my god.
I can't believe it.

30:35.626 --> 30:37.092
I'm so stupid.

30:38.696 --> 30:39.662
Amy...

30:39.664 --> 30:40.896
You're a liar

30:40.898 --> 30:42.631
And a bitch.

30:42.633 --> 30:43.699
Amy...

30:43.701 --> 30:46.235
I hope you get an std
and it kills you.

30:59.116 --> 31:00.816
Let's get a urine tox.

31:00.818 --> 31:02.951
If she took ecstasy,
that would explain her thirst.

31:02.953 --> 31:04.253
Right.

31:04.255 --> 31:05.788
By the way...

31:05.790 --> 31:07.122
Wow.

31:19.937 --> 31:21.837
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

31:21.839 --> 31:23.972
I'm looking for dr. Vicky glass.

31:25.476 --> 31:26.875
Over there.

31:30.881 --> 31:32.047
Dr. Glass?
Yes.

31:32.049 --> 31:33.816
Lieutenant commander choi,
naval reserve.

31:33.818 --> 31:35.451
I'm a resident at chicago med.

31:35.453 --> 31:37.653
Chief mason came into our ed
complaining of stomach pains.

31:37.655 --> 31:38.987
We did a ct and found this.

31:38.989 --> 31:40.022
This cancer could kill him,

31:40.024 --> 31:41.623
Something that
could have been prevented

31:41.625 --> 31:42.991
If you'd run a scan
three months ago

31:42.993 --> 31:44.626
When he first told you
about his symptoms.

31:44.628 --> 31:46.395
Well, i couldn't get him in
for the scan.

31:46.397 --> 31:47.563
Believe me, i wanted to.

31:47.565 --> 31:49.264
I did everything i could
to make it happen,

31:49.266 --> 31:51.667
But as you can see,
there's a huge backlog here--

31:51.669 --> 31:53.402
And you're underfunded
and understaffed.

31:53.404 --> 31:55.170
I don't care.
These guys deserve better.

31:55.172 --> 31:57.339
You can't get a scan approved;
go through back channels.

31:57.341 --> 31:58.474
Oh, you mean screw protocol?

31:58.476 --> 31:59.575
Yes, screw protocol.

31:59.577 --> 32:01.143
Hey, that's an idea.

32:01.145 --> 32:02.978
After all, the va pays
for er care

32:02.980 --> 32:05.214
If a patient can't get
to a va hospital.

32:05.216 --> 32:07.516
Well, i could just tell him
what to say to get a cat scan

32:07.518 --> 32:09.017
And send him to you.

32:11.188 --> 32:14.056
That what you mean?

32:14.058 --> 32:15.758
Yeah.
Good.

32:15.760 --> 32:17.426
We done chatting here?

32:17.428 --> 32:19.661
'cause i've got to get mason in
to see a surgeon.

32:19.663 --> 32:21.230
It might be too late.

32:29.173 --> 32:30.939
I just got the results.

32:30.941 --> 32:34.510
Wanted to bring them
as soon as i got them.

32:34.512 --> 32:36.912
You didn't have to do that.

32:36.914 --> 32:38.414
Wow.

32:38.416 --> 32:41.650
Her utox is negative.
No drugs.

32:42.620 --> 32:45.220
I am out of ideas.

32:45.222 --> 32:46.722
I need to talk to an attending.

32:46.724 --> 32:49.258
I'm taking down
my online profile.

32:49.260 --> 32:50.259
Whatever.

32:50.261 --> 32:51.860
Don't do it on my account.
Go have fun.

32:51.862 --> 32:53.028
"fun"?

32:53.030 --> 32:55.230
I--i've been on one awful date.

32:55.232 --> 32:56.432
She asked me to go on a hike,

32:56.434 --> 32:58.700
And i got bit by a spider.

33:01.071 --> 33:02.604
It still hasn't healed.

33:04.909 --> 33:07.242
Did you hear me?

33:07.244 --> 33:10.512
Do you care?

33:10.514 --> 33:11.814
Environmental studies,

33:11.816 --> 33:15.584
Dehydrated,
the puffy knee...

33:15.586 --> 33:17.019
We have one more test to run.

33:20.257 --> 33:21.623
What happened?

33:21.625 --> 33:24.293
Massive lower gi bleed.
We're taking him to surgery now.

33:24.295 --> 33:26.395
Ethan, he could lose his colon.
Maybe worse.

33:26.397 --> 33:28.664
I promised he'd make
a naval reunion next week.

33:28.666 --> 33:30.466
I'll do my best.

33:30.468 --> 33:32.000
Hang in there, chief.

33:38.742 --> 33:39.908
Michelle's mri?

33:39.910 --> 33:42.244
No sign
of a chiari malformation.

33:42.246 --> 33:45.514
Just add it to the long list
of things i got wrong today.

33:45.516 --> 33:46.548
Come on, nat.

33:46.550 --> 33:49.051
Look, i know something
had to be done.

33:49.053 --> 33:50.819
I just think
we had other options.

33:50.821 --> 33:51.820
Like what?

33:51.822 --> 33:53.188
Like not breaking up a family.

33:53.190 --> 33:54.423
I know how i'd feel

33:54.425 --> 33:56.024
If someone tried to take owen
away from me.

33:56.026 --> 33:57.893
Look,
this was the only way.

33:57.895 --> 33:59.428
Remove the parent
and monitor the kid.

33:59.430 --> 34:00.596
See what's really going on.

34:00.598 --> 34:02.531
What about the trauma
of separation?

34:02.533 --> 34:03.832
I mean,
the guy loses his wife,

34:03.834 --> 34:07.369
And now he's gonna
lose his daughter too?

34:07.371 --> 34:08.904
It is traumatic,

34:08.906 --> 34:09.938
But not fatal.

34:09.940 --> 34:10.939
We don't step in,

34:10.941 --> 34:12.741
Michelle could end up
in the morgue

34:12.743 --> 34:14.309
From medication alone.

34:16.046 --> 34:18.013
This hospital kidnapped
my daughter,

34:18.015 --> 34:19.114
And i want her back.

34:19.116 --> 34:20.949
Mr. Joffe, you can't--
and those two.
