14:51.659 --> 14:53.829
- Oh, my God.
Come here. Come here.
- (John whimpers)

14:53.829 --> 14:56.035
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

14:59.971 --> 15:03.641
(Barry panting)

15:03.975 --> 15:06.211
(guns rattling)

15:14.619 --> 15:17.022
(sighs)

15:24.662 --> 15:26.098
(sighs)

15:37.008 --> 15:38.643
(footsteps echo, fade)

15:51.956 --> 15:53.592
Sally:
John!

15:53.891 --> 15:55.758
- (Noho Hank sighs)
- Sally: John!

15:55.758 --> 15:57.760
(weak breathing)

15:57.760 --> 15:59.762
Sally:
John! Barry!

15:59.762 --> 16:02.226
(weak breathing)

16:02.226 --> 16:03.735
(grunting)

16:04.769 --> 16:06.505
(groans, gasps)

16:07.405 --> 16:09.141
(gasping)

16:10.308 --> 16:11.376
(gasps)

16:12.743 --> 16:15.644
(wheezing, shallow breathing)

16:15.644 --> 16:16.977
(gasps)

16:17.982 --> 16:20.619
(wheezing)

16:22.553 --> 16:23.588
(wheeze)

16:26.757 --> 16:29.024
(whimpering)

16:29.024 --> 16:31.330
- (clang)
- (gasps)

16:33.097 --> 16:34.333
(whimpers)

16:35.528 --> 16:38.070
(gasping, whimpering)

16:39.404 --> 16:40.603
(whimpers)

16:40.603 --> 16:42.307
(exhales)

16:45.405 --> 16:48.447
(birds chirping)

17:14.005 --> 17:16.572
(birds fade out, silence)

17:16.572 --> 17:19.311
(shower running)

17:22.079 --> 17:25.750
(shower continues)

17:27.918 --> 17:29.154
(sighs)

17:33.190 --> 17:36.428
(insects chirping)

17:45.002 --> 17:46.805
I spoke to Cousineau.

17:48.139 --> 17:50.138
I went to his house.

17:50.138 --> 17:51.776
You went to his house?

17:53.077 --> 17:55.680
He might go to jail
for Janice's murder.

18:00.150 --> 18:02.454
You need to turn yourself in.

18:05.351 --> 18:06.791
Yeah.

18:12.563 --> 18:14.965
I don't think that's
what God wants for me.

18:15.832 --> 18:19.604
- (sighs)
- I went in there tonight
prepared to die, and...

18:21.238 --> 18:23.442
for some reason, he spared me.

18:24.575 --> 18:25.977
Honey.

18:26.377 --> 18:28.613
I've been redeemed.

18:29.742 --> 18:31.280
The only way to be redeemed

18:31.280 --> 18:34.586
is by taking responsibility
for what you did.

18:38.189 --> 18:40.425
And the only way
to do that is...

18:42.426 --> 18:43.926
by turning yourself in.

18:43.926 --> 18:45.728
You're tired.

18:45.728 --> 18:47.329
I'm tired.

18:47.329 --> 18:49.564
It's been a long day.

18:49.564 --> 18:53.435
In the morning,
we'll get out of LA. Regroup.

18:53.435 --> 18:56.741
We'll figure out
the next chapter of our lives.

19:01.579 --> 19:03.215
Okay?

19:08.753 --> 19:10.189
(Sally sighs)

19:13.553 --> 19:15.194
(Barry sighs)

19:19.397 --> 19:22.634
- (birds chirping)
- (quiet traffic noise)

19:26.871 --> 19:29.909
(motorcycle drives by)

19:30.775 --> 19:31.810
(sighs)

19:34.712 --> 19:35.747
(groans)

19:39.116 --> 19:40.552
Sally?

19:41.051 --> 19:42.518
(bed creaks)

19:42.518 --> 19:44.223
John?

19:46.457 --> 19:48.424
- (knocks on bathroom door)
- Sally, you in there?

19:48.424 --> 19:50.562
(opens bathroom door)

19:51.028 --> 19:53.461
- Shit.
- (footsteps running)

19:53.461 --> 19:56.064
- (opens door)
- (traffic noise gets louder)

19:56.064 --> 19:57.569
Sally!

20:00.905 --> 20:01.974
Fuck.

20:03.808 --> 20:05.807
(rattles doorknob)

20:05.807 --> 20:07.643
Gene?

20:07.643 --> 20:10.280
- (rattling doorknob)
- Tom: Gene?

20:10.280 --> 20:11.779
It's me. Listen,

20:11.779 --> 20:14.753
I-I hope you're not still on
the internet. Are you okay?

20:17.388 --> 20:19.755
Those news trucks went away,
so, uh,

20:19.755 --> 20:21.961
you can come out now,
if-if you want.

20:24.027 --> 20:27.428
I made, uh, I made a bit of
a mess in the kitchen there.

20:27.428 --> 20:29.298
I, uh, I owe you
a new Vitamix.

20:29.298 --> 20:31.166
So, so, listen,
I'm gonna run out.

20:31.166 --> 20:33.468
Uh, I'm gonna get you
a brand new one, so, uh,

20:33.468 --> 20:35.774
I'm gonna be right back.
Okay?

20:37.108 --> 20:39.274
Listen, buddy, everything's
gonna be fine, I promise you.

20:39.274 --> 20:41.710
J-Just keep
your pecker up, okay?

20:41.710 --> 20:44.616
Remember, you're not alone, alright?

20:53.157 --> 20:54.393
(suitcase rattling)

20:57.461 --> 20:59.531
- Jesus!
- Who the fuck are you?

21:00.865 --> 21:03.032
- Barry: Sally! Sally!
- Jesus Christ.

21:03.032 --> 21:04.466
Barry: Sally!

21:04.466 --> 21:06.934
Tom:
Who are you looking for?
There's no one here.

21:06.934 --> 21:08.970
Barry:
I know she's in here. Sally!
Get outta my way.

21:08.970 --> 21:11.106
- Tom: Easy, easy.
Please don't hurt me.
- Barry: Sally!

21:11.106 --> 21:14.742
John? John, it's Dad!

21:14.742 --> 21:17.045
- Tom: J-Just calm down, please.
- Where's my family?

21:17.045 --> 21:20.115
Hey, I know they're here.
Sally Reed. Blonde girl.

21:20.115 --> 21:21.316
She's got a little boy
with her.

21:21.316 --> 21:22.817
I swear on my life,
they've never come here.

21:22.817 --> 21:25.286
They've been
talking to Cousineau.
I know they're here.

21:25.286 --> 21:27.088
Tom:
Please believe me,
they're not here.

21:27.088 --> 21:30.395
- (panting)
- (distant dog barking)

21:31.796 --> 21:33.832
Listen. Uh...

21:34.765 --> 21:36.197
Maybe, uh...

21:36.197 --> 21:38.367
maybe it's a good thing
that you...

21:38.367 --> 21:40.703
that you came now, Barry.

21:40.703 --> 21:42.638
You know, Gene

21:42.638 --> 21:45.841
is in a desperate situation.

21:45.841 --> 21:47.675
Gene's gonna go to jail.

21:47.675 --> 21:51.483
He's being accused of all
the things th-that you did.

21:53.517 --> 21:56.686
You're the only one
who can save him, Barry.

21:56.686 --> 21:59.791
(Tom panting)

22:00.559 --> 22:02.794
This is an opportunity...

22:03.528 --> 22:05.764
to do the right thing.

22:19.343 --> 22:21.580
A-And you haven't seen
a little boy here?

22:22.246 --> 22:23.882
Tom:
I haven't.

22:34.259 --> 22:35.894
I see.

22:50.008 --> 22:51.873
You should call the cops.

22:51.873 --> 22:53.578
Tom:
The cops?

22:54.378 --> 22:56.212
- I'm gonna turn myself in--
- (gunshot)

22:56.212 --> 22:57.946
Ah...

22:57.946 --> 22:59.484
Jeez...

23:03.654 --> 23:05.024
- Oh, wow.
- (gunshot)

23:14.994 --> 23:18.037
(insects, birds chirping)

23:27.111 --> 23:29.845
Tom (muffled):
The address, uh,
it, it's 331 Everwood!

23:29.845 --> 23:31.579
It's the corner of
Everwood and Steiner!

23:31.579 --> 23:33.885
Look, we need an ambulance
right now, okay?!

23:48.433 --> 23:52.167
(applause)

23:52.167 --> 23:55.204
(applause continues)

23:55.204 --> 23:58.510
(crowd cheering)

24:03.348 --> 24:04.713
(indistinct)

24:04.713 --> 24:08.020
- (audience cheering)
- (giggles)

24:09.053 --> 24:10.419
Thank you!

24:10.419 --> 24:11.848
(indistinct whisper)

24:11.848 --> 24:13.558
(giggles, sniffs)

24:14.124 --> 24:15.290
(laughs)

24:15.290 --> 24:17.092
How amazing are they?
(laughs)

24:17.092 --> 24:20.199
(applause, cheering continue)

24:23.301 --> 24:26.568
- (crowd chatter)
- Student 1: Hey, that was
so wonderful, Ms. Reed.

24:26.568 --> 24:29.104
Sally:
Oh, thank you, guys.
Thanks for coming.

24:29.104 --> 24:31.539
Hey, I wanna see
you audition next spring!

24:31.539 --> 24:34.246
- Student 2: Okay, got it.
- Sally: Bye! Drive safe.

24:37.281 --> 24:39.151
Okay, let's go home.

24:40.952 --> 24:43.152
Sally Reed?

24:43.152 --> 24:44.720
- Hi.
- Sally: Yeah? Hi.

24:44.720 --> 24:46.021
It was
a great show tonight.

24:46.021 --> 24:47.688
Oh, thank you so much.

24:47.688 --> 24:50.959
I love "Our Town."
I'm actually a big
"Our Town" head.

24:50.959 --> 24:52.061
- (laughs)
- Oh.

24:52.061 --> 24:53.262
Oh, Robert. Uh,

24:53.262 --> 24:56.331
- I'm the new, uh,
AP history teacher.
- Oh, hey!

24:56.331 --> 24:57.767
Hey, Robert.
Nice to meet you.

24:57.767 --> 24:59.101
Robert: I try to get
my students to come out

24:59.101 --> 25:00.935
and support the theater kids.

25:00.935 --> 25:03.538
It's, you know,
it's a hell of a lot easier
when it's this good.

25:03.538 --> 25:06.541
Aw, well, that's so nice
of you to say.

25:06.541 --> 25:08.443
I mean,
not all year groups
are created equal,

25:08.443 --> 25:10.745
so they're a really great bunch. Thanks.

25:10.745 --> 25:13.243
- Thanks for coming.
- Hey, uh, do you wanna
go get a drink

25:13.243 --> 25:15.988
or maybe a cup of coffee
or something?

25:17.455 --> 25:19.421
No.

25:19.421 --> 25:20.756
O-Of course.

25:20.756 --> 25:22.853
Cool, okay.
Nice to meet you, Robert.

25:22.853 --> 25:25.064
Let's go, John!

25:25.930 --> 25:27.365
Mom...

25:27.731 --> 25:29.899
Is it cool if I stay
at Eric's tonight?

25:29.899 --> 25:31.767
Yeah, it's fine.

25:31.767 --> 25:35.037
- (opens car door)
- You'll be okay?

25:35.037 --> 25:37.609
Yeah. I'll be fine.

25:38.776 --> 25:41.076
Okay. I love you.

25:41.076 --> 25:42.314
Hey, John?

25:44.515 --> 25:46.247
Was it okay?

25:46.247 --> 25:48.787
Yeah, of course.
It always is.

25:49.353 --> 25:51.387
- It was good, right?
- Yes.

25:51.387 --> 25:52.691
(sighs)

25:54.058 --> 25:56.295
Okay. Yeah, have fun.
Be good.

25:57.095 --> 25:58.130
(shuts car door)

25:58.891 --> 25:59.861
She say yes?

25:59.861 --> 26:02.131
- (car engine starts)
- Yeah.

26:02.131 --> 26:03.835
You ready for this?

26:04.401 --> 26:06.963
- (car driving away)
- Yeah. Yeah.

26:06.963 --> 26:08.673
Come on. Let's go.

26:10.208 --> 26:13.245
(soft breathing)

26:42.406 --> 26:44.707
Alright.
You want a drink, bro?

26:44.707 --> 26:47.412
Uh, no. Thank you.
I-I don't drink.

26:48.279 --> 26:51.116
- (puts down glass)
- Eric: (sighs) Ready for this?

26:52.649 --> 26:54.984
I don't know
if I wanna watch it.

26:54.984 --> 26:57.185
Eric:
D-Don't listen to
your mom, alright?

26:57.185 --> 26:58.687
You deserve to see this.

26:58.687 --> 27:01.460
- Filename MC.
- (monitor beeps)

27:02.026 --> 27:05.561
(dramatic music playing on TV)

27:05.561 --> 27:06.865
(lights click)

27:11.069 --> 27:13.105
(dramatic sting)

27:16.374 --> 27:17.409
(sighs)

27:18.809 --> 27:21.709
- (car honking)
- (bus doors hiss)

27:21.709 --> 27:24.747
Marine (narrating):
<i>I'm a soldier. A Marine.</i>

27:24.747 --> 27:26.414
(street chatter)

27:26.414 --> 27:29.887
<i>Just gettin' back from
a long tour in Afghanistan.</i>

27:30.520 --> 27:33.258
<i>I got no job.
Got no family.</i>

27:33.758 --> 27:36.119
<i>- Got no friends.</i>
- (bus drives away)

27:36.119 --> 27:38.493
<i>I need a community.</i>

27:38.493 --> 27:40.429
I keep having all
these nightmares.

27:40.429 --> 27:42.898
All the terrible shit
I saw in combat.

27:42.898 --> 27:44.970
It's really fucked me up.

27:45.870 --> 27:48.107
I just wanna feel
human again.

27:49.334 --> 27:52.041
And I'm sick
of takin' orders.

27:52.041 --> 27:54.610
(British accent)
No orders from me.

27:54.610 --> 27:56.916
But you will get a few notes.

27:58.883 --> 28:01.611
Gene Cousineau.

28:01.611 --> 28:05.190
- (dramatic music continues)
- (tense breathing)

28:06.190 --> 28:08.423
(stilted)
She should have died.

28:08.423 --> 28:11.230
(normal)
Sorry, let me do it again.
(clearing throat)

28:12.496 --> 28:15.897
(soft exhale, getting louder)

28:15.897 --> 28:19.067
- (gunfire)
- (soldiers screaming)

28:19.067 --> 28:20.769
(choking)

28:20.769 --> 28:23.475
Ambush!
(echoing, fading)

28:28.144 --> 28:30.946
- There would have been
a time for such a word.
- (heartfelt piano plays)

28:30.946 --> 28:33.982
Tomorrow and tomorrow
and tomorrow

28:33.982 --> 28:36.888
creeps in this petty pace
from day to day.

28:37.722 --> 28:40.359
It is a tale told by an idiot.

28:41.559 --> 28:44.029
Full of sound and fury

28:44.829 --> 28:47.332
signifying nothing.

28:48.733 --> 28:50.365
(panting)

28:50.365 --> 28:52.101
Barry, that was wonderful.

28:52.101 --> 28:53.436
(music swells)

28:53.436 --> 28:55.540
The passion, the intensity.

28:56.140 --> 28:58.110
You just had
your first breakthrough.

28:58.810 --> 29:00.742
I did what you taught me,
Mr. Cousineau.

29:00.742 --> 29:02.311
All that terrible stuff
I told you?

29:02.311 --> 29:03.949
I used it, and it worked.

29:06.284 --> 29:09.318
I'm so proud of you.

29:09.318 --> 29:12.521
What you did up there
today was amazing!

29:12.521 --> 29:16.091
Oh, thanks.
I'm still learning.
I'm Barry, by the way.

29:16.091 --> 29:17.359
Sally Reed.

29:17.359 --> 29:19.094
Movie Barry:
<i>Yeah, I know who you are.
You're like,</i>

29:19.094 --> 29:20.729
<i>one of the best
students in class.</i>

29:20.729 --> 29:22.732
Mr. Cousineau,
you'll never guess...

29:22.732 --> 29:24.267
(dramatic music)

29:24.267 --> 29:25.801
Ryan Madison?

29:25.801 --> 29:27.403
Who are these two guys?
Mr. Cousineau?

29:27.403 --> 29:29.165
We're busy, Barry.

29:29.165 --> 29:31.440
(music crescendos)

29:31.440 --> 29:32.577
(door shuts)

29:33.043 --> 29:35.977
I'm sorry to tell you all
this but your classmate,

29:35.977 --> 29:37.579
Ryan Madison,
has been killed.

29:37.579 --> 29:40.316
- (dramatic gasps)
- If any of you have
any information,

29:40.316 --> 29:41.684
please talk to me.

29:41.684 --> 29:44.990
- (dramatic music)
- (murmuring)

29:46.857 --> 29:49.094
I'll help you
solve this case...

29:50.194 --> 29:51.927
if you'll let me
take you out to dinner.

29:51.927 --> 29:54.129
(music crescendos)

29:54.129 --> 29:56.865
Mr. Cousineau,
what was that noise?

29:56.865 --> 29:59.038
Oh, my God!
What happened?

30:00.037 --> 30:01.637
It doesn't matter.
I need your help.

30:01.637 --> 30:02.938
We need to get rid of the body.

30:02.938 --> 30:05.607
What?
I thought you loved her!
How could you?

30:05.607 --> 30:07.943
They'll put me away for this.
Is that what you want?

30:07.943 --> 30:09.778
I knew something was
up with you, Cousineau!

30:09.778 --> 30:11.113
You owe me.

30:11.113 --> 30:13.081
I took you in
and helped you
become human again.

30:13.081 --> 30:15.317
I fought for you.
Now, it's your turn.

30:15.317 --> 30:16.685
You're a soldier.

30:16.685 --> 30:19.555
Now, do your duty!

30:19.555 --> 30:21.089
(sighs)

30:21.089 --> 30:22.892
I can't.

30:22.892 --> 30:24.662
Not like this.

30:25.062 --> 30:27.299
You're going to regret this,

30:27.999 --> 30:29.965
Barry Berkman.

30:29.965 --> 30:32.133
<i>Barry Berkman...</i>

30:32.133 --> 30:35.007
<i>murdered Janice Moss
in cold blood.</i>

30:35.539 --> 30:38.239
- That son of a bitch.
- Movie Cousineau:
<i>Then he kidnapped me,</i>

30:38.239 --> 30:40.141
<i>threw me in
the trunk of a car...</i>

30:40.141 --> 30:42.977
- (gate bangs open)
- On your feet, Berkman.

30:42.977 --> 30:46.214
- Sorry, brother. I know
you're just doing your job.

30:51.923 --> 30:55.160
(dramatic music,
struggling continue)

30:56.588 --> 30:58.463
What are you
gonna do with us?

30:59.364 --> 31:00.862
(speaking Russian)

31:00.862 --> 31:03.098
- (gunshots)
- (Movie Sally gasps)

31:03.098 --> 31:05.434
- Barry! No!
- I got you. I got you.
It's okay.

31:05.434 --> 31:08.303
- It's okay. I got you.
Is he okay? Is he okay?
- (crying) He's okay.

31:08.303 --> 31:10.406
Alright, we gotta move.
We gotta move. Stay behind me.

31:10.406 --> 31:12.074
- Okay?
- Okay.

31:12.074 --> 31:15.380

31:16.280 --> 31:20.082

31:20.082 --> 31:23.388
(melodramatic screaming)

31:24.755 --> 31:27.623
- (dramatic sting)
- You shouldn't have
come back, Barry.

31:27.623 --> 31:29.761
You ruffled
a lot of feathers.

31:30.327 --> 31:33.262
- You're finished, Cousineau.
- (Movie Cousineau laughs)

31:33.262 --> 31:34.964
You know, Barry,
none of this would've happened

31:34.964 --> 31:37.332
if you'd helped me clean up
that Janice mess.

31:37.332 --> 31:40.338
I thought soldiers knew
how to take orders.

31:40.704 --> 31:44.643
Sometimes,
being a good soldier means
not taking orders.

31:46.977 --> 31:49.578

31:49.578 --> 31:53.218
