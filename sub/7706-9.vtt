WEBVTT

00:02.336 --> 00:03.569
[door opens]

00:05.439 --> 00:08.841
Hey, Kate, guess what I am.

00:08.843 --> 00:10.376
Is it something
that begins with "couch"

00:10.378 --> 00:12.778
and ends with "potato"?

00:12.780 --> 00:15.180
Cheap shot, Kate-mandu.

00:15.182 --> 00:17.549
I'm a Type T personality.

00:17.551 --> 00:21.220
Okay, ALF.
What is a Type T personality?

00:21.222 --> 00:23.022
Well, according to this article

00:23.024 --> 00:25.557
a Type T is a thrill-seeker.

00:25.559 --> 00:27.626
Someone who looks for danger

00:27.628 --> 00:29.862
who laughs in the face of death.

00:29.864 --> 00:31.230
Ha-ha-ha.

00:31.232 --> 00:32.631
Is this from the same person

00:32.633 --> 00:34.133
who watched the movie "Aliens"

00:34.135 --> 00:36.235
from under the couch?

00:36.237 --> 00:38.937
Hey, I thought I owed
one of those guys money.

00:40.408 --> 00:42.508
Am I a Type T?

00:42.510 --> 00:45.844
Well, do you enjoy
hand gliding off cliffs

00:45.846 --> 00:48.147
into rock filled gorges?

00:48.149 --> 00:49.248
I don't know.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.649
Well, let's find out!

00:50.651 --> 00:52.718
What do you say
we jump off the roof?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.421
You land feet-first,
you're a wimp.

00:55.423 --> 00:57.389
I'll go get the ladder!

00:57.391 --> 01:00.893
No one is jumping off the roof.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.561
Hey, Kate, let me know

01:02.563 --> 01:04.797
when you'll let your son
act like a man.

01:07.234 --> 01:09.935
Aah! Paper cut, paper cut!

01:09.937 --> 01:11.470
Ooh!

01:12.840 --> 01:15.441
[theme music]

01:35.930 --> 01:38.530
[music continues]

01:51.545 --> 01:54.513
[music continues]

02:15.069 --> 02:17.402
[instrumental music]

02:22.576 --> 02:24.676
(ALF)
'How was work today, honey?'

02:26.814 --> 02:28.947
What are you doing in my bed?

02:28.949 --> 02:32.651
Your bed?
It happens to be half Kate's!

02:33.687 --> 02:35.988
Did Kate say
you could lie there?

02:35.990 --> 02:38.590
Does that sound
like something Kate would say?

02:38.592 --> 02:40.759
Get out of my bed.

02:40.761 --> 02:43.395
Now, that sounds like Kate.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.532
ALF, did you take my pillow?

02:46.534 --> 02:48.734
Yeah, it's under my tushie.

02:50.337 --> 02:53.772
- Keep it.
- Don't go! I'm depressed!

02:53.774 --> 02:55.974
And Willie's
kicking me out of bed.

02:55.976 --> 03:00.445
I'm sorry. I-I didn't know you
were depressed. What's wrong?

03:00.447 --> 03:03.448
Well, I was looking through
my photos.

03:03.450 --> 03:06.185
Seeing all the adventures
I used to have.

03:06.187 --> 03:07.619
Hm.

03:07.621 --> 03:10.222
Here, that's me
climbing Mt. Floppy

03:10.224 --> 03:11.857
on the planet Griphard.

03:11.859 --> 03:14.860
Climbing? That mountain
looks flat.

03:14.862 --> 03:15.861
It is flat.

03:15.863 --> 03:19.031
It's the planet that's tilted.

03:19.033 --> 03:20.899
The planet..

03:20.901 --> 03:23.068
...is tilted.

03:23.070 --> 03:25.237
That's amazing!

03:25.239 --> 03:27.206
Try playing golf there sometime.

03:27.208 --> 03:30.576
You're lucky if you shoot
in the low 600s.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.511
What are you doing
in this barrel?

03:32.513 --> 03:34.146
Oh, there I was getting ready

03:34.148 --> 03:37.482
to go up Widow-maker Falls.

03:37.484 --> 03:39.885
You went up a waterfall?

03:39.887 --> 03:42.321
Yeah, and the ride was so rough

03:42.323 --> 03:44.056
I almost threw down!

03:45.025 --> 03:47.893
You really did have
an exciting life.

03:47.895 --> 03:50.362
<i> "Did"</i> is the operative word.

03:50.364 --> 03:53.565
Those days are over,<i> ma cherie.</i>

03:53.567 --> 03:56.768
Well, you had
a pretty exciting day yesterday.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.238
How do you figure that?

03:59.240 --> 04:02.107
You built that big bonfire
in our backyard.

04:02.109 --> 04:04.443
And you got to see
the fire engines again.

04:04.445 --> 04:07.679
Well, that gets old.
Right, Willie?

04:07.681 --> 04:11.550
No, I get a lump in my throat
every single time.

04:11.552 --> 04:14.920
Look who I'm talking to
about excitement.

04:14.922 --> 04:17.256
Now, look here, I'm not gonna be
put down by some guy

04:17.258 --> 04:20.225
who climbed the flat mountain.

04:20.227 --> 04:22.194
I-I know my life may appear

04:22.196 --> 04:23.562
a bit routine at times

04:23.564 --> 04:25.764
but I've had
my share of adventure.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.599
I've lived on the edge.

04:27.601 --> 04:28.900
That's right.

04:28.902 --> 04:30.269
When I was born,
mom and dad lived

04:30.271 --> 04:31.970
on the edge of Bakersfield.

04:33.440 --> 04:35.741
Now, you listen to me,
young lady.

04:35.743 --> 04:38.043
There's plenty about me
that you, uh..

04:38.045 --> 04:39.278
...you don't know.

04:39.280 --> 04:41.046
Like what?

04:41.048 --> 04:44.583
Well, nothing you really
need to know about right now.

04:44.585 --> 04:45.884
Does it have anything to do

04:45.886 --> 04:47.452
with you wearing
Kate's red pumps?

04:47.454 --> 04:49.221
No, it's..

04:51.458 --> 04:52.824
Why would you..

04:52.826 --> 04:55.294
Why would you
say something like that?

04:57.731 --> 04:59.197
I'm an instigator.

05:01.068 --> 05:02.901
[laughs]
Dad, tell us what you did.

05:02.903 --> 05:03.935
No.

05:03.937 --> 05:06.571
Oh, please.
I really wanna know.

05:06.573 --> 05:08.974
Well, uh..

05:08.976 --> 05:11.343
When I was 17
I hopped a freight train.

05:11.345 --> 05:14.079
I took it right straight
across the whole country.

05:14.081 --> 05:15.847
You're kidding!

05:15.849 --> 05:17.516
What did you do for money?

05:17.518 --> 05:19.651
I did odd jobs, I, uh..

05:19.653 --> 05:21.119
I washed dishes..

05:21.121 --> 05:22.521
I-I played the piano

05:22.523 --> 05:25.290
in a honky-tonk place
in Texas.

05:25.292 --> 05:27.693
- Does mom know about all this?
- Oh, yeah, sure.

05:27.695 --> 05:29.995
But...she doesn't like me
to talk about it

05:29.997 --> 05:33.332
because she doesn't want
you and Brian getting any ideas.

05:33.334 --> 05:35.300
- How come?
- Well, uh..

05:35.302 --> 05:37.336
She doesn't want them
hopping trains.

05:37.338 --> 05:38.870
- How come?
- Well..

05:38.872 --> 05:41.173
That's not something
you want your children to do.

05:41.175 --> 05:43.375
How come?

05:43.377 --> 05:45.010
I don't know, it's just Kate

05:45.012 --> 05:47.879
laying down
these arbitrary rules.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.881
Well, that's Kate for ya.

05:51.318 --> 05:53.285
[crickets chirping]

05:54.855 --> 05:56.788
[toy train chugging]

06:01.562 --> 06:03.662
Hey, Willie,
is this the kind of train

06:03.664 --> 06:05.130
you used to hop?

06:05.132 --> 06:07.833
Well, the others were bigger,
of course

06:07.835 --> 06:10.369
and they-they didn't just
run around in circles.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.204
But, uh..

06:12.206 --> 06:14.306
...basically, yeah.

06:15.342 --> 06:17.042
How'd you do it?

06:17.044 --> 06:18.243
Well..

06:20.247 --> 06:21.813
Here's what I'd do, you see.

06:21.815 --> 06:24.249
I'd case the yard,
I-I'd hide in the bush.

06:24.251 --> 06:26.551
I'd wait until dark and when
I saw my train was pulling out

06:26.553 --> 06:29.054
I would just go
make a run for it.

06:29.056 --> 06:31.022
Whoa! Well, did it ever get
so dark

06:31.024 --> 06:32.891
you jumped on the wrong thing

06:32.893 --> 06:35.060
like a bus or a parade?

06:35.062 --> 06:38.063
Try to ask
some sensible questions, ALF.

06:38.065 --> 06:39.865
Okay.

06:39.867 --> 06:41.099
Which one is the kitchen car?

06:41.101 --> 06:44.503
[laughs]
There wasn't any kitchen car.

06:44.505 --> 06:47.873
Yes, I sat in the boxcar,
I-I ate beans out of a can.

06:47.875 --> 06:51.176
That's how I got
my traveling name!

06:51.178 --> 06:52.310
Bean head?

06:55.249 --> 06:56.915
Boxcar Willie.

06:56.917 --> 06:59.084
Wow, what a cool name!

06:59.086 --> 07:00.585
Hey, can I have your autograph?

07:00.587 --> 07:02.254
- No!
- Come on, come on!

07:02.256 --> 07:03.655
I guess.

07:05.592 --> 07:06.925
[door opens]

07:06.927 --> 07:08.193
Willie, are you sure
you don't want to go

07:08.195 --> 07:09.261
to my mother's with us?

07:09.263 --> 07:11.129
Oh, yeah, I'm positive.

07:11.131 --> 07:13.932
If dad doesn't have to go,
why do I?

07:13.934 --> 07:16.902
Because you're my son
and I can tell you what to do.

07:16.904 --> 07:19.137
Well, there you have it.

07:21.742 --> 07:25.377
- What's this?
- Oh, it's, uh, my autograph.

07:25.379 --> 07:27.813
Uh, ALF wanted it.

07:27.815 --> 07:30.081
It's for a friend.

07:30.083 --> 07:31.950
Well, we'll be back
in a couple of hours.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.985
Now, don't get into any trouble.

07:33.987 --> 07:36.922
Don't worry about Willie.
I'll keep an eye on him.

07:36.924 --> 07:39.424
I was talking to you.

07:39.426 --> 07:42.627
I know. I was being playful.

07:42.629 --> 07:44.496
- See you later, Willie.
- Okay.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.031
- Buh-bye.
- Bye.

07:49.269 --> 07:50.836
Now's our chance.

07:50.838 --> 07:54.005
Let's go down to the train yard.

07:54.007 --> 07:56.107
No, we're not hopping any train.

07:56.109 --> 07:59.311
I'm not talking
about riding the rails!

07:59.313 --> 08:01.146
I just wanna see them!

08:01.148 --> 08:03.815
Please, Willie. Ple-e-ease?

08:03.817 --> 08:05.917
No, we can't!
Really, ALF, we can't.

08:05.919 --> 08:08.820
Alright. Tell me
when this gets annoying.

08:08.822 --> 08:11.289
Yeah, yeah. You hopped
the freight train.

08:11.291 --> 08:12.624
Sure. Oh, right. Yeah.

08:12.626 --> 08:15.427
Yeah, I almost believed that.
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

08:15.429 --> 08:16.695
Look at Mr. Excitement.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.998
Forget it, ALF.
It's not working!

08:20.000 --> 08:22.701
Okay, I'll try something else.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.470
Willie, please take me
to see the trains.

08:25.472 --> 08:28.173
I haven't had an adventure
in a long time.

08:29.510 --> 08:32.811
Alright, maybe this will work.

08:32.813 --> 08:34.379
Willie, I'm dying.

08:34.381 --> 08:35.914
[coughs]

08:37.184 --> 08:40.852
I've only got 24 hours to live,
25, tops.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.387
Okay, come on.

08:42.389 --> 08:44.389
You bought that?

08:44.391 --> 08:46.491
I bought
the second thing you said.

08:46.493 --> 08:48.026
Oh! Well, what was it?

08:48.028 --> 08:49.728
I might wanna
use it again some time.

08:49.730 --> 08:50.962
Come on.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.031
- Bring a sweater.
- Okay.

08:53.033 --> 08:56.268
[instrumental music]

08:58.872 --> 09:02.941
[sighs]
Boy, there's nothing
like a train yard at night!

09:03.710 --> 09:06.878
Yeah. It is peaceful.

09:06.880 --> 09:08.046
[train honking]

09:08.048 --> 09:10.315
Whoa! What's that thing?

09:10.317 --> 09:13.218
[chuckles]
That's the train!

09:13.220 --> 09:16.321
It makes the one you have
look like a toy!

09:16.323 --> 09:18.557
That's really something,
isn't it?

09:18.559 --> 09:22.360
You know that engine alone
weighs about 75 tons?

09:22.362 --> 09:26.364
You know what would happen
if I put a penny on that track?

09:26.366 --> 09:31.770
The train'd derail and all the
bums would spill their beans.

09:31.772 --> 09:34.739
That penny would be flat.

09:34.741 --> 09:38.743
Wille, pennies are already flat.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.512
(male #1)
'Hey, who's out there?'

09:40.514 --> 09:42.747
Uh-oh, that's the guard.

09:42.749 --> 09:45.250
You mean, that guy
with the Seeing Eye dog?

09:45.252 --> 09:47.552
Duh! Big deal!

09:47.554 --> 09:48.954
No. That's no Seeing Eye dog.

09:48.956 --> 09:50.789
That's a Doberman pinscher.

09:50.791 --> 09:52.891
Yikes! Don't let him pinch me!

09:52.893 --> 09:54.259
[dog barking]

09:54.261 --> 09:55.827
ALF!

09:57.264 --> 10:00.198
(male #1)
'Hey, get away from that train!'

10:00.200 --> 10:02.601
ALF, jump!

10:02.603 --> 10:04.369
Run, Boxcar, run!

10:07.474 --> 10:08.974
All aboard!

10:08.976 --> 10:10.909
Hey, I always
wanted to say that.

10:10.911 --> 10:12.777
Well, you got your wish!

10:12.779 --> 10:14.813
And you got yours, too!

10:14.815 --> 10:16.948
We're riding the rails, Willie.

10:16.950 --> 10:19.284
- Ain't it grand?
- No, it ain't.

10:19.286 --> 10:22.220
Now the train's going too fast,
we can't get off!

10:22.222 --> 10:23.622
[panting]

10:23.624 --> 10:26.257
You're acting like
this is all my fault.

10:26.259 --> 10:27.492
Well, isn't it?

10:27.494 --> 10:29.361
I was hoping we could share.

10:34.267 --> 10:38.303
¶ Good morning America
how are ya? ¶

10:38.305 --> 10:39.738
¶ Don't you know me ¶

10:39.740 --> 10:42.073
¶ I'm your native son ¶¶

10:43.810 --> 10:45.810
What's the next line?

10:45.812 --> 10:48.446
Just be quiet.

10:48.448 --> 10:52.217
Really? I'm surprised
that song was such a big hit.

10:53.153 --> 10:55.954
¶ Just be quiet
just be quiet ¶

10:55.956 --> 10:58.089
¶ Just be quiet ¶

11:06.099 --> 11:08.400
Who do you think
is on "Letterman" tonight?

11:11.104 --> 11:13.271
Probably Teri Garr.

11:15.776 --> 11:19.511
Maybe hopping the train
was a bad idea.

11:19.513 --> 11:22.714
Maybe? Maybe..

11:22.716 --> 11:24.983
Whatever possessed you

11:24.985 --> 11:27.552
to do such a thing?

11:27.554 --> 11:29.521
I am not sure.

11:29.523 --> 11:31.523
Isn't impetuosity a word?

11:31.525 --> 11:32.957
Yes, it is.

11:32.959 --> 11:36.828
Then I did it
because I'm impetuosity.

11:36.830 --> 11:38.630
I couldn't help myself.

11:38.632 --> 11:43.201
You made riding the rails
sound so exciting!

11:43.203 --> 11:44.669
Well..

11:44.671 --> 11:45.737
[chuckles]

11:45.739 --> 11:47.072
As long as we're here

11:47.074 --> 11:49.040
we might as well
enjoy ourselves, eh?

11:49.042 --> 11:51.142
Yeah, that's the spirit.

11:51.144 --> 11:54.546
Come on. Let's crack open
a can of beans.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.881
What beans?
We've got no beans.

11:56.883 --> 12:00.151
This trip
was totally misrepresented.

12:00.153 --> 12:03.088
Look, let's just
look out the door

12:03.090 --> 12:06.091
and-and-and
watch the world go by.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.028
It's dark out.

12:10.030 --> 12:14.099
Let's just stare
at the darkness.

12:14.101 --> 12:17.068
Stare at the darkness?

12:17.070 --> 12:19.304
What are you? A beatnik?

12:20.574 --> 12:23.108
Listen, this was your idea
to ride the rails.

12:23.110 --> 12:24.409
Don't you think
the least you could do

12:24.411 --> 12:26.745
is to try to make
the most of it?

12:26.747 --> 12:30.014
Alright! Alright! I'll stare.

12:31.752 --> 12:33.318
[train chugging]

12:34.888 --> 12:36.855
(male #1)
'Litchfield? Flatcar?'

12:36.857 --> 12:38.089
'Is that you?'

12:38.091 --> 12:39.924
Willie! Willie, it's a hobo.

12:39.926 --> 12:41.359
Hide me.

12:49.302 --> 12:52.904
Uh, no, I'm sorry. We're not
Litchfield and Flatcar.

12:52.906 --> 12:56.007
Don't be sorry.
They got no teeth.

12:57.644 --> 12:59.944
- Where's your buddy?
- Well, he's there.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.479
Just-just there
behind the crates.

13:01.481 --> 13:02.947
He's...he's shy.

13:02.949 --> 13:04.616
He's terribly shy
around strangers.

13:04.618 --> 13:08.286
Strangers? Hey, I'm no stranger.
You are the stranger!

13:08.288 --> 13:11.122
I know everybody
who rides the Rock Island line.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.457
Mighty good line.

13:12.459 --> 13:14.893
What?

13:14.895 --> 13:17.595
Never mind.
Nothing, I-I, noth..

13:17.597 --> 13:19.998
- You're a funny guy.
- Oh.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.633
- Gravel Gus.
- Willie Tanner.

13:21.635 --> 13:22.801
H-how do you do?

13:22.803 --> 13:24.669
Uh, say, Gravel Gus

13:24.671 --> 13:27.172
I guess you got your name
because of your voice there.

13:27.174 --> 13:28.840
- Right?
- No.

13:28.842 --> 13:31.643
It's because the first six times
I tried to hop a freight

13:31.645 --> 13:34.679
I landed facedown
in the gravel.

13:34.681 --> 13:36.648
Oh-oo-oo.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.551
It could be worse.
Ask Cesspool Steve.

13:41.521 --> 13:43.388
Oh, double ooh.

13:48.662 --> 13:52.263
- How long you been riding?
- Uh, since I was about 17.

13:52.265 --> 13:54.766
Of course, I took
a break there for 30 years.

13:54.768 --> 13:59.070
30 years. That's how long
I've been riding.

14:00.340 --> 14:03.174
I used to work
on Madison Avenue.

14:03.176 --> 14:07.612
And one day I decided to chuck
the A game.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.714
Here I am.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.283
That's a fascinating story.

14:12.285 --> 14:15.520
Yeah. Too bad it's not true.

14:15.522 --> 14:19.224
Hm. Actually I've always been
a bum.

14:19.226 --> 14:21.192
Well, there's dignity in that.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.094
Not the way I done it.

14:24.030 --> 14:26.865
Hey, you guys want some beans?

14:26.867 --> 14:28.867
I do! I do!

14:28.869 --> 14:30.735
Ahh! A loose kangaroo!

14:30.737 --> 14:33.271
[screaming]

14:36.076 --> 14:37.675
Hey! Is he alright?

14:37.677 --> 14:41.279
Well, he fell facedown
in a pile of gravel.

14:42.349 --> 14:44.549
Well, this is a fine
how-do-you-do.

14:44.551 --> 14:48.186
No matter what happens,
I get no beans.

14:48.188 --> 14:50.822
You know, I'm really getting
tired of you whining.

14:50.824 --> 14:54.225
I'm getting tired of whining.
So there!

14:54.227 --> 14:56.594
I guess I won't mention
how cold it is.

14:56.596 --> 14:58.129
Thank you.

14:59.733 --> 15:02.567
Is it okay if I put my foot
under your armpit?

15:02.569 --> 15:03.601
No, it's not!

15:03.603 --> 15:06.137
- Aren't you cold?
- Yes, I am.

15:08.074 --> 15:12.644
Wouldn't you like to wrap your
armpit around my nice warm foot?

15:14.614 --> 15:18.349
Look, ALF,
if we don't think about the cold

15:18.351 --> 15:21.052
it's not going to be so bad.

15:21.054 --> 15:24.389
Fine. Live in a fantasy world.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.258
- Whoa!
- Ow, ooh, Willie.

15:27.260 --> 15:29.727
- I bumped my head.
- Oh, here, let me see.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.362
Ow, you're hurting me.

15:32.766 --> 15:34.565
Do you know, for someone
who's traveled all the way

15:34.567 --> 15:37.268
across this universe
and had all kinds of adventures

15:37.270 --> 15:39.037
climbed a flat mountain?

15:39.039 --> 15:42.674
You are an incredible baby.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.278
I never climbed Mount Floppy.

15:48.548 --> 15:50.882
What are you talkin' about?
I saw you in the picture.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.452
It was taken at a carnival.

15:54.454 --> 15:57.755
I stuck my head
through a cardboard cutout.

15:57.757 --> 16:00.091
It cost me a wernick.

16:00.093 --> 16:01.626
- A wernick?
- Yeah.

16:01.628 --> 16:04.595
That's ten dollars on Melmac.

16:04.597 --> 16:06.264
Well, what about, what about

16:06.266 --> 16:08.266
that picture of you
in that barrel?

16:08.268 --> 16:11.502
- I paid a matter for it.
- What's a matter?

16:11.504 --> 16:14.138
Well, for one thing,
I've got this bump on my head.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.307
Ha ha ha!

16:16.309 --> 16:17.909
Good one, huh?

16:19.646 --> 16:22.513
This was back when
you were dating Rhonda?

16:22.515 --> 16:26.451
Yeah, but there was no such
thing as dating on Melmac.

16:26.453 --> 16:29.253
If you liked a girl,
you took her to dinner

16:29.255 --> 16:30.521
and a movie.

16:32.158 --> 16:34.826
Just sounds
remarkably like dating.

16:34.828 --> 16:38.830
We called it taking a girl
to dinner and a movie.

16:38.832 --> 16:41.132
Uh, just like
there were no telephones.

16:41.134 --> 16:45.336
They were called those plastic
things on the counter that ring.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.539
Of course. Of course.

16:48.541 --> 16:51.376
It's just as plain as this
breathing apparatus on my face.

16:52.846 --> 16:54.545
That's your nose, Willie.

16:54.547 --> 16:59.183
Why must you needlessly
complicate everything?

16:59.185 --> 17:00.284
Please continue.

17:00.286 --> 17:01.652
[clears throat]

17:01.654 --> 17:04.856
Well, I just started
going out with Rhonda

17:04.858 --> 17:06.524
when my planet blew up.

17:07.694 --> 17:10.194
Unlucky in love.

17:10.196 --> 17:12.663
Unlucky in Armageddon.

17:12.665 --> 17:14.198
I'm sorry, ALF.

17:14.200 --> 17:16.968
Hey, at least
I don't worry anymore.

17:16.970 --> 17:21.039
When my planet blew up,
I realized one thing.

17:21.041 --> 17:23.941
You have to live every moment
to the fullest.

17:25.879 --> 17:27.478
Oh, look, Willie

17:27.480 --> 17:29.881
that's where Melmac used to be.

17:29.883 --> 17:31.382
Where?

17:31.384 --> 17:33.051
That spot up there
where it looks like

17:33.053 --> 17:34.552
there should be a planet.

17:36.689 --> 17:39.590
Oh, look, ALF,
it's a shooting star.

17:39.592 --> 17:41.726
Make a wish.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.294
Okay.

17:46.066 --> 17:47.632
Well, what did you wish?

17:48.735 --> 17:50.935
I wished I had my planet back.

17:50.937 --> 17:52.570
Oh.

17:52.572 --> 17:53.938
ALF.

17:53.940 --> 17:56.974
[harmonica music]

18:00.413 --> 18:03.114
Well, cheer up, ALF,
because at least you know

18:03.116 --> 18:04.682
your friends
are still out there.

18:04.684 --> 18:06.584
Maybe-maybe
you'll meet up someday.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.586
May-maybe you and Rhonda
will get together.

18:08.588 --> 18:10.588
Maybe you'll get married.

18:10.590 --> 18:14.092
Yeah. Hey, I'm still young.

18:14.094 --> 18:18.896
If I'm not married by the time
I hit the big four-O-O

18:18.898 --> 18:20.498
then I'll panic.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.634
Maybe I'll marry Lynn.

18:23.636 --> 18:26.938
- What?
- I'm kidding. Cool down.

18:26.940 --> 18:30.308
Okay, I'm cool, I'm cool.

18:30.310 --> 18:31.476
Uh, you are kidding about that?

18:31.478 --> 18:33.678
- Yes!
- Okay, I'm cool.

18:35.115 --> 18:37.281
I guess you always knew
you were gonna get married

18:37.283 --> 18:38.816
and settle down, huh?

18:38.818 --> 18:40.284
Well, actually, uh..

18:40.286 --> 18:43.254
...I didn't really
ever think I really would.

18:43.256 --> 18:44.455
No luck with the babes?

18:44.457 --> 18:47.425
No, I had babes.
I mean, I had girlfriends.

18:47.427 --> 18:50.761
I just, uh, I didn't think I..

18:50.763 --> 18:53.097
I wanted to do the things
my father did.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.432
[train horn blowing]

18:54.434 --> 18:55.766
What was he like?

18:55.768 --> 18:57.802
Well.

18:57.804 --> 19:01.606
You know, he was married,
two kids, lived in the suburbs.

19:01.608 --> 19:04.709
Wow. And you're his son.

19:06.746 --> 19:08.913
I'm sorry, Willie, go on.

19:08.915 --> 19:12.350
I just, I wanted my life to be
more exciting than his was.

19:12.352 --> 19:14.986
That's all.
That's why I started..

19:14.988 --> 19:17.922
That's why I started
riding the rails.

19:17.924 --> 19:19.490
So what happened?

19:19.492 --> 19:22.693
Well, I met a girl in Colorado.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.529
We were working
in this restaurant.

19:24.531 --> 19:26.497
She-she was saving her money
to go to California.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.000
She wanted to be an actress.

19:29.002 --> 19:31.502
And I don't know,
we started going out together

19:31.504 --> 19:33.304
and before I knew it, I..

19:33.306 --> 19:36.440
...I-I fell in love.

19:36.442 --> 19:38.342
Why, I never knew Kate
wanted to be an actress.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.677
No. It wasn't Kate.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.512
It was Linda Evans.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.550
That's the truth.

19:45.552 --> 19:48.085
Really? You dated her?

19:50.023 --> 19:53.191
Well, way to go, Willie.

19:53.193 --> 19:55.026
What happened?

19:55.028 --> 19:56.627
Oh, I don't know.

19:56.629 --> 19:59.697
She set out to find
the footlights

19:59.699 --> 20:04.302
and I set out to find the sky.

20:04.304 --> 20:07.205
Boy, you showed her.

20:07.207 --> 20:09.874
Well, it's just as well,
I found the girl of my dreams

20:09.876 --> 20:13.377
I found that girl, that one girl
I wanted to spent the whole

20:13.379 --> 20:15.680
rest of my life with.

20:15.682 --> 20:19.383
- Joan Collins?
- Kate.

20:19.385 --> 20:22.053
- Kate.
- Oh, right. Yeah.

20:22.055 --> 20:24.388
Well, you married
the right girl.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.057
Linda's much too busy.

20:26.059 --> 20:29.193
She'd never be home in time
to tuck me in.

20:29.195 --> 20:31.128
Well, I'm so glad you approve.

20:32.599 --> 20:36.067
Kate's made me
a very happy man, you know.

20:36.069 --> 20:39.604
Yeah, but you better face it,
Willie.

20:39.606 --> 20:43.040
You did follow
in your father's footsteps.

20:43.042 --> 20:44.709
Yeah, but I found out

20:44.711 --> 20:48.379
there's a lot of adventure
out there in the suburbs.

20:48.381 --> 20:49.447
There is.

20:49.449 --> 20:50.581
Buying our house

20:50.583 --> 20:52.216
having our first Christmas

20:52.218 --> 20:55.519
seeing Lynne come out
of the delivery room..

20:55.521 --> 20:58.689
...hearing Brian say "Dad,"
you know?

20:59.559 --> 21:01.125
Hey. Hey.

21:01.127 --> 21:05.596
What about that pesky alien
crashing through your roof?

21:05.598 --> 21:07.598
That's certainly
been an adventure.

21:07.600 --> 21:09.934
Yeah, for me too.

21:13.239 --> 21:14.639
Willie..

21:15.975 --> 21:19.176
...do you ever wish I hadn't
crashed through your roof?

21:24.484 --> 21:26.183
Never.

21:27.787 --> 21:29.153
Thanks..

21:30.323 --> 21:31.622
...dad!

21:32.925 --> 21:34.859
[laughs]

21:37.130 --> 21:38.229
Yeah.

21:38.231 --> 21:39.797
[laughing]

21:39.799 --> 21:41.999
[instrumental music]

21:45.738 --> 21:49.307
[instrumental music]

21:49.309 --> 21:52.310
[phone ringing]

21:52.312 --> 21:55.313
Hello? Willie!

21:55.315 --> 21:57.014
Willie, where are you?

22:00.353 --> 22:02.953
You're kidding.

22:02.955 --> 22:07.325
well, honey, I'll be there
as soon as I can.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.694
I'm glad I married you too.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.697
Are dad and ALF alright?

22:12.699 --> 22:17.168
They are Barstow.
They've been riding the rails.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.936
That's fantastic.

22:20.673 --> 22:23.674
I mean that's terrible. Bad dad.

22:23.676 --> 22:26.177
- Bad ALF.
- I'll pick them up.

22:28.715 --> 22:31.382
What's riding in the rails?

22:31.384 --> 22:35.286
Uh, something that your father
did a long time ago

22:35.288 --> 22:37.855
and that you will never do.

22:37.857 --> 22:41.125
Oh, you mean like dating
Linda Evans?
