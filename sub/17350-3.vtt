-What is your situation?
-(SHUDDERING) Breakdown.

Thunderbirds are go!

02:11.667 --> 02:13.067
(CHEERFUL WHISTLING)

02:17.567 --> 02:20.300
Good morning,
International Rescue!

02:20.367 --> 02:22.067
-Hi, Virgil.
-Hey, what's up?

02:22.100 --> 02:24.233
Uh... Oh, look, bagels!

02:24.300 --> 02:26.467
Did you order them
for a special occasion?

02:26.533 --> 02:29.167
"Order"? They were
meant to be pancakes,

02:29.233 --> 02:30.400
but they didn't
turn out right.

02:30.467 --> 02:31.633
Oh.

02:31.700 --> 02:33.900
-Today is a very important day.
-It is!

02:33.967 --> 02:37.567
We're installing the new
ram jet in Thunderbird 1
this morning.

02:37.633 --> 02:39.400
I get to test it.

02:39.467 --> 02:42.500
Which means there's
a 34% chance I'll be
trying out Tracy Island's

02:42.567 --> 02:44.600
new firefighting
equipment as well.

02:44.667 --> 02:45.767
Hey!

02:45.833 --> 02:48.100
Hmm, August 15th...
Does that date ring a bell?

02:48.167 --> 02:52.433
Absolutely! It's my
meeting with the top
brass at GDF. Ugh.

02:52.500 --> 02:55.733
-Wish me luck.
-Good luck. Er...

02:55.800 --> 02:58.067
Gordo, have you guys
forgotten something?

02:58.067 --> 02:59.833
I don't think so.

02:59.900 --> 03:03.567
Wait, yes, of course!
Thunderbird 4's
necells need cleaning.

03:03.633 --> 03:05.500
Thanks for reminding
me, Virgil.

03:05.567 --> 03:08.667
Hmm, one of the hazards
of being in the world's
most elite rescue team.

03:08.733 --> 03:11.600
Life doesn't stop just
because it's your birthday.

03:11.667 --> 03:14.567
(SIGHS) They could at least
have left me a bagel.

03:14.633 --> 03:15.700
(BEEPS)

03:15.767 --> 03:17.100
Thanks, Max.

03:17.167 --> 03:20.633
Hmm, not exactly
birthday cake,
but I'll take it.

03:20.700 --> 03:21.800
(ALARM BLARING)

03:21.867 --> 03:23.200
Virgil, good.

03:23.267 --> 03:25.067
Thunderbird 2 is needed.
It's time to move.

03:25.100 --> 03:27.867
Looks like Grandma's tooth
buster will have to wait, Max.

03:27.933 --> 03:31.800
-(BEEPS)
-Wait, John, you do know
what day it is, don't you?

03:31.867 --> 03:33.400
Of course I do. It's Sunday.

03:34.200 --> 03:36.200
(SIGHS) Best birthday ever.

04:50.200 --> 04:52.767

04:58.400 --> 05:00.533
VIRGIL: Thunderbirds are go.

05:07.433 --> 05:09.633
We've intercepted an
incomplete distress call.

05:09.700 --> 05:12.600
-All I got was a single
word, "Breakdown."
-VIRGIL: "Breakdown"?

05:12.667 --> 05:15.867
Thunderbird 2 is a
state-of-the-art rescue
vehicle, not a tow truck.

05:15.933 --> 05:18.333
The call came from
a priority emergency beacon

05:18.400 --> 05:22.100
on the glacial ice shelf
800 miles inside
the Arctic Circle.

05:22.167 --> 05:23.767
Now that makes a difference.

05:23.833 --> 05:26.933
-Thunderbirds go where
other tow trucks can't.
-Precisely.

05:27.067 --> 05:29.233
It'll be a quick one.
You'll be there and back
before lunch.

05:29.300 --> 05:30.500
VIRGIL: F-A-B.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.467

(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

05:40.867 --> 05:42.133

05:42.200 --> 05:44.367
Okay, guys,
Thunderbird 2 is away.

05:44.433 --> 05:46.067
Virgil doesn't
suspect a thing.

05:46.133 --> 05:48.167
Ugh, I was worried I was
gonna have to eat this.

05:48.233 --> 05:50.433
We've got about two hours
before he gets back.

05:50.500 --> 05:52.900
Virgil totally thinks
we forgot his birthday.

05:52.967 --> 05:55.900
Now, let's get this island
ready for a party,
Tracy style.

05:55.967 --> 05:57.367
Yes! Ooh, cake.

05:57.433 --> 05:59.133
Uh, someone else
made this, right?

05:59.200 --> 06:00.633
Straight from Paris.

06:00.700 --> 06:02.500
And not until
Virgil gets back.

06:02.567 --> 06:04.733
(GRUNTS) Virgil better hurry.

06:09.867 --> 06:12.767
JOHN: You're approaching
the ice shelf now.
Do you have visual?

06:12.833 --> 06:15.100
Wow, it's beautiful.

06:15.167 --> 06:17.200
It looks like... Like a...

06:17.267 --> 06:19.167
Like a huge frosted
birthday cake.

06:19.233 --> 06:21.400
-JOHN: What was that?
-VIRGIL: Er, nothing.

06:24.333 --> 06:26.067
I've located
the emergency beacon.

06:26.133 --> 06:27.467
I'm putting her
down on the ice.

06:57.567 --> 07:01.167
(BEEPS)

07:01.233 --> 07:02.567
I think I found our guy.

07:05.200 --> 07:06.567
(GROANING)

07:08.700 --> 07:12.800
Hey there, buddy.
It's a bit cold to be
taking a nap out here.

07:12.867 --> 07:15.100
Breakdown.

07:15.167 --> 07:17.067
VIRGIL: Yeah, sounds
like our man, all right.

07:17.133 --> 07:18.500
-(GROANING)
-Uploading vitals.

07:18.567 --> 07:20.533
JOHN: Pulse is
weak but stable.

07:20.600 --> 07:22.700
Core temperature
is dangerously low.

07:22.767 --> 07:24.100
Get him on board
Thunderbird 2

07:24.167 --> 07:25.733
and put him into
a hypo chamber stat.

07:25.800 --> 07:28.267
We'll soon have you
toasty as a teacake.

07:29.200 --> 07:31.433
Mmm, cake.

07:37.267 --> 07:39.067
-(GROANS)
-Blood pressure's rising.

07:39.133 --> 07:41.167
He's warming up nicely.

07:41.233 --> 07:43.667
JOHN: Now just drop your
guest off at the Nuke Medical
Center and return to base.

07:43.733 --> 07:46.833
-I said this was just a
quick breakdown call.
-"Breakdown"?

07:46.900 --> 07:49.567
Doesn't a breakdown usually
involve some kind of vehicle?

07:49.633 --> 07:52.200
I didn't see anything
out there, not even
a pair of ice skates.

07:52.267 --> 07:55.067
I'll scan the area
for vehicle readings.

07:55.067 --> 07:57.567
Negative, nothing
for 200 miles.

07:57.633 --> 07:59.833
Looks like your job here
is done. Come on home.

07:59.900 --> 08:01.133
F-A-B.

08:01.633 --> 08:02.900
Hmm.

08:02.967 --> 08:04.167
Thunderbird 5,

08:04.233 --> 08:06.567
can you redo that scan,
but this time

08:06.633 --> 08:08.133
focus it down?

08:08.200 --> 08:09.600
(BEEPING)

08:12.100 --> 08:13.267
Good call, Virgil.

08:13.333 --> 08:15.067
I'm picking up
a vehicle signature

08:15.133 --> 08:17.067
and there's two
life signals as well.

08:17.133 --> 08:19.133
VIRGIL: In the ice?
How far down?

08:19.200 --> 08:21.700
Approximately 2,000 meters.

08:21.767 --> 08:23.133
Better prepare a pod.

08:23.200 --> 08:25.500
Looks like this won't be such
a quick rescue after all.

08:44.400 --> 08:46.500
All right, Pod Explorer is go.

08:59.533 --> 09:00.767
Cool.

09:04.200 --> 09:06.600
900 meters.

09:06.667 --> 09:08.133
1,600 meters.

09:08.200 --> 09:10.067
1,700 meters.

09:10.133 --> 09:12.500
Sheesh, this thing
goes down forever.

09:13.633 --> 09:14.733
Whoa!

09:14.800 --> 09:15.800
(TIRES SCREECHING)

09:20.233 --> 09:21.800
Deploy grappling hooks!

09:24.967 --> 09:26.233
VIRGIL: Argh!

09:26.300 --> 09:27.967
JOHN: Pod Explorer,
are you okay?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.200
(PANTING) Yeah.

09:29.267 --> 09:31.367
I think I found
the cause of the breakdown.

09:41.933 --> 09:43.800
(POWERING DOWN)

09:50.067 --> 09:51.200
Hello?

09:53.467 --> 09:56.167
-(MAN GROANING)
-Did someone call a tow truck?

09:57.767 --> 09:59.367
Finally!

09:59.433 --> 10:01.533
We've been waiting forever.

10:01.600 --> 10:04.367
The fall knocked our laser
out of alignment.

10:04.433 --> 10:06.367
It's incredibly inconvenient!

10:06.433 --> 10:09.800
I am Professor Gonchorov
and this is Dr. Peck.

10:09.867 --> 10:11.900
We are on
a scientific expedition

10:11.967 --> 10:13.667
when we hit this chamber.

10:13.733 --> 10:17.233
Our crew leader
volunteered to climb up
to the distress beacon.

10:17.300 --> 10:19.100
We got his call.
He's a brave man.

10:19.167 --> 10:21.500
A bit chilly
but he's going to be fine.

10:21.567 --> 10:24.500
Now, let's get you
two out of this
oversized ice cube.

10:24.567 --> 10:27.900
No, not happening.
Our research is too important.

10:27.967 --> 10:31.033
Just fix this thing and
we'll continue on our way.

10:31.100 --> 10:33.033
I'm not really a repairman.

10:33.100 --> 10:35.200
This is non-negotiable.

10:35.267 --> 10:37.700
Well, I am pretty handy

10:37.767 --> 10:39.333
with an electron
monkey wrench.

10:39.400 --> 10:41.267
Give me a minute
and I'll see what I can do.

10:41.333 --> 10:43.100
Good! And be quick about it!

10:44.233 --> 10:45.700
Pod Explorer,
what's your status?

10:45.767 --> 10:47.967
Seems like they don't really
want to be rescued.

10:48.033 --> 10:51.367
Perhaps we should
just change our name to
International Breakdown.

10:51.433 --> 10:53.967
International Breakdown,
we have a situation.

10:54.033 --> 10:56.333
Hmm, doesn't quite have
the same ring to it.

11:02.067 --> 11:03.500
Let's see.

11:03.567 --> 11:05.600
You know how important
it is to keep going on.

11:05.667 --> 11:09.233
-We cannot stop,
this is far too important.
-(RUMBLING)

11:09.300 --> 11:11.500
-VIRGIL: What was that?
-What? I didn't hear anything.

11:11.567 --> 11:12.700
Yeah.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.433
(RUMBLING)

11:14.500 --> 11:15.733
Ah...

11:15.800 --> 11:18.133
-You had to hear it that time.
-Oh, that, er, it's nothing.

11:18.200 --> 11:19.800
Just glacial shift.

11:19.867 --> 11:21.533
Don't worry,
it's completely normal.

11:21.600 --> 11:23.667
Now, hurry up,
I don't have all day.

11:23.733 --> 11:25.467
(GRUNTS) That's got it.

11:25.533 --> 11:26.567
(POWERING UP)

11:32.067 --> 11:33.533
Come on, we've got to hurry.

11:33.600 --> 11:34.667
You're welcome?

11:34.733 --> 11:35.933
(RUMBLING)

11:36.067 --> 11:37.133
Uh-oh.

11:38.267 --> 11:39.600
Get out of there!
It's not safe!

11:39.667 --> 11:43.300
-(GRUNTS)
-No! We have to keep digging!

11:43.367 --> 11:44.800
(DR. PECK YELLING)

11:45.933 --> 11:48.067
Run! Run!

11:51.367 --> 11:53.500
I'm picking up major
seismic disturbances

11:53.567 --> 11:55.067
in the ice shelf.
Give me a sitrep.

11:55.100 --> 11:57.533
This is a little more than
my repair skills can handle.

11:57.600 --> 11:58.833
It's a disaster.

11:58.900 --> 12:01.367
Looks like the end of the road
for this research trip, Doc.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.700
We'll have to continue
into the fissure network
on foot.

12:03.767 --> 12:06.100
But we decided it wasn't
safe without the drill.

12:06.167 --> 12:08.167
This time we really don't
have a choice.

12:08.233 --> 12:09.733
Thunderbird 5, we're okay,

12:09.800 --> 12:11.567
but our friends
have lost their ride.

12:11.633 --> 12:13.367
JOHN: Then you better get
them out of there fast.

12:13.433 --> 12:15.767
My scans are showing the
ice shelf is highly unstable

12:15.833 --> 12:17.700
and in danger of
imminent collapse.

12:17.767 --> 12:19.567
There's less time
than I thought.
We have to hurry.

12:19.633 --> 12:22.367
Doc, no science is worth
risking your life for.

12:22.433 --> 12:24.233
You can tunnel
into the ice another time.

12:24.300 --> 12:27.633
I must complete my
research before
the shelf disintegrates.

12:27.700 --> 12:29.500
I'm going to evacuate
you in the pod.

12:29.567 --> 12:32.100
-But... (SIGHS)
-This is non-negotiable!

12:32.167 --> 12:34.900
I can only take one
of you at a time.
Who's first?

12:34.967 --> 12:36.433
Professor Gonchorov, I insist.

12:36.500 --> 12:39.467
-Hmm.
-Okay, Doc,
I'll be right back.

12:42.167 --> 12:46.067
Your associate is, um,
how shall I say it?
Very determined.

12:46.133 --> 12:49.100
It's what makes him
an excellent scientist,

12:49.167 --> 12:51.833
and somewhat a difficult
human being.

12:51.900 --> 12:54.867
-But I believe in
what we are doing...
-(GRUNTS)

12:54.933 --> 12:56.300
And that helps.

12:58.133 --> 12:59.567
(POWERING UP)

13:20.233 --> 13:21.433
VIRGIL: Steady now.

13:22.067 --> 13:23.567
Easy does it.

13:32.267 --> 13:35.600
-What's so important
down here, anyway?
-It's complicated.

13:35.667 --> 13:38.300
-You'll be safe in here.
-Thank you. Arthur.

13:38.367 --> 13:41.267
Just got to pick up Dr. Peck
and we'll be on our way.

13:41.333 --> 13:44.167
Be quick, Virgil.
That ice shelf could
collapse any minute.

13:44.233 --> 13:47.400
Trust me,
I won't take a moment
longer than I have to.

13:47.467 --> 13:50.100
Hi, guys, Virgil's got one
more round-trip to make,

13:50.167 --> 13:51.400
then he'll be on his way back.

13:51.467 --> 13:54.200
-Uh, hmm. He-he.
-(GRUNTS)

13:54.267 --> 13:57.133
You wanna lose that finger,
young man?

13:57.200 --> 13:59.067
-Try me.
-(UNEASY LAUGH)

14:01.733 --> 14:02.767
Mmm. (CHUCKLES)

14:08.933 --> 14:11.400
Come on, Doc,
we've got to get out of here.

14:12.300 --> 14:14.333
(SIGHS) Where'd he go?

14:14.400 --> 14:15.800
JOHN: Infrared scans show

14:15.867 --> 14:17.967
Peck has gone into
the fissure maze on foot.

14:18.067 --> 14:19.667
I'm going in after him.

14:19.733 --> 14:21.567
I'll drag him out kicking
if I have to.

14:38.067 --> 14:40.067
(ECHOING) Dr. Peck, hold up.

14:40.067 --> 14:41.400
You're being
rescued, remember?

14:41.467 --> 14:42.500
(RUMBLING)

14:50.767 --> 14:52.600
I've got to keep going.

14:52.667 --> 14:54.667
I can't stop. (PANTING)

14:54.733 --> 14:56.200
I've got to find it.

15:07.067 --> 15:08.367
Got you now, Doc.

15:13.667 --> 15:15.633
Oh-oh-oh-whoa!

15:16.133 --> 15:18.167
(YELLING)

15:20.067 --> 15:21.867
Virgil, that was
a major ice quake.

15:21.933 --> 15:23.467
-(ALARM BLARING)
-Virgil, are you there?

15:23.533 --> 15:24.600
Virgil?

15:25.633 --> 15:28.500
Pod Explorer,
respond. Virgil?

15:28.567 --> 15:31.967
Don't worry, I'm still
hanging in here.

15:32.067 --> 15:33.600
(CRACKING)

15:35.067 --> 15:36.267
(GRUNTING)

15:40.233 --> 15:42.067
Dr. Peck.

15:42.100 --> 15:43.767
Help, quick. I'm trapped.

15:43.833 --> 15:45.233
(GRUNTS)

15:47.433 --> 15:48.733
Ah, ah.

15:51.400 --> 15:53.500
When you said you could
go on, on foot,

15:53.567 --> 15:55.567
I don't think you actually
meant one foot.

15:55.633 --> 15:57.433
Maybe now you'll agree
to be rescued?

15:57.500 --> 16:01.267
Hey... No, I must complete
my research. It's non...

16:01.333 --> 16:04.500
I know, I know,
it's non-negotiable.

16:04.567 --> 16:07.133
Er, Thunderbird 5,
does the Big Book
of Saving People

16:07.200 --> 16:08.500
say anything about
rescuing someone

16:08.567 --> 16:11.500
who doesn't actually
want to be rescued?

16:11.567 --> 16:13.067
Does he seem like
he's lost his mind

16:13.100 --> 16:14.433
or is acting against his will?

16:14.500 --> 16:16.733
He's weird and rude
and kind of frustrating,

16:16.800 --> 16:18.333
but that's about it.

16:18.400 --> 16:20.200
Well, whatever you decide,
you better choose soon.

16:20.267 --> 16:23.167
-That ice shelf is about to
dive into the ocean.
-F-A-B.

16:23.233 --> 16:26.733
I'll be out of here
in a few minutes,
with or without Dr. Peck.

16:28.467 --> 16:30.500
Just what is
so important down here

16:30.567 --> 16:32.800
that it's worth risking
your life for?

16:32.867 --> 16:34.533
Bacterium C Platensis.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.433
Right, now
I know you're crazy.

16:36.500 --> 16:38.167
Okay, you're coming with me.

16:38.233 --> 16:40.167
Stop! Put me down! I...

16:40.233 --> 16:43.067
(PANTING) It's a matter
of life or death.

16:43.067 --> 16:45.433
Explain yourself, quickly.

16:45.500 --> 16:49.467
This glacier is
110,000 years old.

16:49.533 --> 16:51.933
Core drilling revealed
this ancient bacterium

16:52.067 --> 16:55.067
has been trapped
inside the ice for
all those millennia.

16:55.067 --> 16:56.700
When the ice shelf collapses,

16:56.767 --> 16:59.900
this bacterium
will be lost forever.

17:00.067 --> 17:03.367
And? What's so important
about a bunch of old germs?

17:03.433 --> 17:06.067
It's my daughter.
She's got Chiver's disease.

17:06.100 --> 17:08.100
(RUMBLING)

17:08.167 --> 17:10.367
I've dedicated my life
to finding a cure

17:10.433 --> 17:12.700
for her and
all the others like her.

17:12.767 --> 17:15.333
The bacterium holds
the secret to that cure

17:15.400 --> 17:18.367
if I can get
a large enough sample.

17:18.433 --> 17:22.300
That's why I can't go back,
that's why I've got to go on.

17:22.367 --> 17:25.867
I've got to complete
my research for her.

17:25.933 --> 17:29.900
You're on a rescue mission.
Why didn't you say?

17:29.967 --> 17:32.967
This wasn't authorized
by the foundation
that owns the drill.

17:33.067 --> 17:34.900
I was afraid
you'd shut us down.

17:34.967 --> 17:36.200
I don't have that authority.

17:36.267 --> 17:38.600
I'm just the tow truck
driver, remember?

17:38.667 --> 17:43.100
And I could really use
a lift right now. Please.

17:43.167 --> 17:45.500
Thunderbird 5,
this is Pod Explorer.

17:45.567 --> 17:47.533
I'm going to be
a few more minutes.

17:47.600 --> 17:49.133
JOHN: Virgil, you don't
have a few more minutes.

17:49.200 --> 17:50.600
You've got to get
out of there now.

17:50.667 --> 17:53.733
Sorry, but there's more than
just two lives at stake here.

17:54.400 --> 17:55.900
Trust me.

17:55.967 --> 17:58.233
(INDISTINCT CHATTERING)

18:02.700 --> 18:05.400
-(ALARM BLARING)
-Guys, it's Virgil.

18:05.467 --> 18:07.433
-Finally.
-He's gonna be a bit longer.

18:07.500 --> 18:09.800
He's going deeper
into the glacier.

18:09.867 --> 18:12.300
What? But you said it was
going to collapse.

18:12.367 --> 18:15.067
I know, it is, but he
wants us to trust him.

18:15.133 --> 18:17.300
Oh, time for cake.

18:17.367 --> 18:20.067
I always eat when I'm
worried about you boys.

18:20.067 --> 18:22.100
So do I. Huh.

18:22.167 --> 18:23.400
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

18:26.500 --> 18:28.067
It's close.

18:28.100 --> 18:29.600
It's very close.

18:32.133 --> 18:34.667
Bacterium C Platensis.

18:36.433 --> 18:37.600
Ah.

18:39.767 --> 18:43.067
Okay, gather what you need
and let's get out of here.

18:43.067 --> 18:44.300
(GROANING)

18:46.767 --> 18:47.800
(SIGHS)

18:49.533 --> 18:50.733
(RUMBLING)

18:51.433 --> 18:52.500
Got it.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.333
Whoa!

18:56.400 --> 18:59.667
Pod Explorer returning
to Thunderbird 2 pronto.

19:19.933 --> 19:21.200
(GRUNTS)

19:23.067 --> 19:25.867
-(ALARM BLARING)
-Virgil, the ice shelf
is collapsing.

19:25.933 --> 19:27.300
Get out of there now.

19:29.333 --> 19:31.267
We're going as fast as we can.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.733
200 meters.

19:36.867 --> 19:40.133
100 meters.
There's the entrance.

19:40.200 --> 19:41.367
We're not gonna make it.

19:41.433 --> 19:43.133
I made us stay down
here too long.

19:43.200 --> 19:45.600
Don't give up, I'm due
a little birthday luck.

19:45.667 --> 19:47.367
Engaging booster.

19:47.433 --> 19:49.733
-Woo-hoo!
-(DR. PECK SCREAMING)

20:20.167 --> 20:22.967
VIRGIL: This is
Thunderbird 2.
Mission complete.

20:23.033 --> 20:24.533
I'm on my way home.

20:26.967 --> 20:28.300
(MUSIC PLAYING ON SPEAKERS)

20:29.900 --> 20:32.467
Okay, guys, get ready.
He's on his way back.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.300
(ALL EXULTING)

20:34.367 --> 20:37.700
(YAWNS) It's about time!
He's been gone all day.

20:37.767 --> 20:40.400
-Where can I drop you?
-Mercy Hospital.

20:40.467 --> 20:41.700
You got it.

20:58.033 --> 20:59.533
Looks like
I missed a good party.

20:59.600 --> 21:02.267
Still, at least
there's cake...

21:02.333 --> 21:04.433
Crumbs. They ate it all?

21:04.500 --> 21:07.267
-(BEEPING)
-This better be
a birthday message.

21:07.333 --> 21:09.800
Virgil, this is Dr. Peck.

21:09.867 --> 21:13.067
We've begun synthesis
of a treatment
using the bacterium

21:13.133 --> 21:14.967
and it looks like
we found a cure.

21:15.067 --> 21:18.333
Daddy, you promised
to read me Torchy.

21:18.400 --> 21:20.467
Sorry, got to go.

21:20.533 --> 21:22.333
That one was my favorite, too.

21:23.067 --> 21:24.333
Thank you again.

21:24.400 --> 21:26.500
Oh, and happy birthday.

21:26.567 --> 21:29.533
(CHUCKLES) Best birthday ever.
