00:07.882 --> 00:11.720
Why is love intensified
by absence?

00:11.803 --> 00:13.346
How does it feel?

00:13.430 --> 00:16.933
Hmm.
How does it feel?

00:21.062 --> 00:25.900
Normal. You know. Like nothing.

00:25.984 --> 00:29.154
Like your attention wandered
for a moment, and...

00:29.237 --> 00:32.699
suddenly the book you're reading
is gone, your coffee's gone,

00:32.782 --> 00:33.783
the room is gone,

00:33.867 --> 00:35.952
and you're ankle-deep
in a ditch...

00:38.788 --> 00:40.123
...or in the middle
of a highway...

00:41.791 --> 00:44.127
-HENRY, Oh, shit!

00:45.003 --> 00:46.546
...or in a field full of cows.

00:51.509 --> 00:53.344
And of course...
...you're naked.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.181
Back in time, and naked.

01:03.354 --> 01:05.315
The bedsheets will go slack.

01:05.398 --> 01:09.110
Or the shower will keep running,
or the bacon will keep frying,

01:09.194 --> 01:12.614
or you'll hear
a coffee cup smash on the floor,

01:12.697 --> 01:15.116
and you realize, he's gone.

01:15.200 --> 01:17.660
-CLARE, It's happened again.

01:19.204 --> 01:21.247
He's just a pile of clothes.

01:35.929 --> 01:38.306
CLARE, And then it starts.

01:39.349 --> 01:40.391
The waiting.

01:44.521 --> 01:47.607
Time travel.
It's not a superpower.

01:47.690 --> 01:50.735
It's a disability.
It's what's wrong with me.

01:50.819 --> 01:55.031
I can't keep hold
of the current moment, I just...

01:56.241 --> 02:00.036
slide off. I fall back in time.

02:00.119 --> 02:03.248
When he's gone,
I wait and I worry.

02:04.207 --> 02:07.836
I wonder where he is,
when he is.

02:09.420 --> 02:10.547
If he's in danger.

02:12.465 --> 02:14.676
Now, sometimes you ping
straight back to where you were.

02:14.759 --> 02:17.470
You know, to your book,
to your coffee, and it's fine.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.138
It's nothing.
Five minutes, a nap.

02:27.772 --> 02:33.444
Sometimes it's days, weeks,
months, and you have to survive.

02:34.821 --> 02:40.118
Now, three things I got good at.
Running, fighting, and stealing.

02:41.411 --> 02:43.371
You have to be good at those,
when wherever you go,

02:43.454 --> 02:44.622
you're naked.

02:47.000 --> 02:49.627
-Fuck.

02:59.637 --> 03:02.932
Well,
that's a difficult question.

03:03.016 --> 03:04.726
Seriously,
you're asking me that?

03:04.809 --> 03:06.519
When did we first meet?

03:06.603 --> 03:08.396
First meet?

03:09.814 --> 03:11.232
Define "first."

03:11.316 --> 03:14.944
I married a time traveler.
It's complicated.

04:47.578 --> 04:49.789
CLARE, If you're not
a time traveler, the past

04:49.872 --> 04:51.541
is what you're stuck with.

04:51.624 --> 04:54.711
If you're an artist,
or think you might be,

04:54.794 --> 04:57.255
the future
is what you're gonna make.

04:57.338 --> 05:00.800
Sometimes, you can see
the future in a bowl of slop.

05:03.136 --> 05:04.220
Other times...

05:05.638 --> 05:08.850
-Clare? You okay?
-You know what I need?

05:12.145 --> 05:14.355
Dr. Felman, I need to go
to the library.

05:14.439 --> 05:16.315
-Okay.
-The Newberry Library.

05:17.859 --> 05:19.527
-What's there?
-Porn.

05:21.446 --> 05:24.032
CLARE, Other times...

05:24.115 --> 05:26.743
...other times, you remember
that the future is just

05:26.826 --> 05:28.036
what shows up
when you're looking

05:28.119 --> 05:29.287
for something else.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.920
People think
libraries are quiet places.

05:38.004 --> 05:40.131
To me a library is a crowd.

05:40.214 --> 05:42.759
If you're a time traveler,
the past is alive.

05:42.842 --> 05:45.720
It's still happening,
still dangerous.

05:45.803 --> 05:47.722
All those books
on all those shelves

05:47.805 --> 05:49.390
are like the bars on a cage,

05:50.349 --> 05:52.310
and the beast inside is pacing.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.398
For everybody else,
the past is over.

05:57.482 --> 06:00.276
For me, well,
I'm still trying to survive it.

06:00.359 --> 06:03.237
Are these yours?
I found them in the stacks.

06:03.321 --> 06:05.323
Uh... yeah, thanks.

06:05.406 --> 06:06.699
Henry. I've been meaning
to ask you.

06:06.783 --> 06:08.910
Why do you leave piles
of clothes all over the place?

06:08.993 --> 06:10.495
-Doesn't everyone?
-No.

06:12.288 --> 06:13.456
It's complicated.

06:15.249 --> 06:17.668
Okay. I'm listening.

06:17.752 --> 06:21.297
-It's a long story.
-Time isn't a problem for me.

06:22.340 --> 06:23.341
Lucky you.

06:24.842 --> 06:27.762
-Henry.

06:31.349 --> 06:32.308
Hey.

06:37.146 --> 06:40.274
-...the language of--
-Ah, excuse me.

06:40.358 --> 06:41.442
You okay?

06:41.526 --> 06:43.694
Yeah, no, I'm good.
What's going down here?

06:43.778 --> 06:45.446
Presentation
on rare dictionaries.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.865
Oh, God. I love dictionaries.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.534
You know the best thing
about a dictionary?

06:50.868 --> 06:52.787
It's the only book with words
in the right order.

06:52.870 --> 06:55.832
Yeah, we're good here.
Thanks, Henry.

06:55.915 --> 06:57.625
-The right order
is very important.

06:57.708 --> 06:58.835
You can trust me on that.

07:00.086 --> 07:02.630
If you wait just one moment,
perhaps Mr. DeTamble

07:02.713 --> 07:04.423
-can help you.
-CLARE, Thank you.

07:12.140 --> 07:14.058
-Ah, Isabelle?
-Hmm?

07:14.142 --> 07:16.894
There is a young woman
in Presentation Two.

07:16.978 --> 07:19.647
Could you maybe shake her awake
when Tom's done boring her

07:19.730 --> 07:22.150
and kind of mention my name
with general overtones

07:22.233 --> 07:24.443
-of enthusiasm?

07:24.527 --> 07:26.904
-The Kelmscott Press Chaucer.
-What about it?

07:26.988 --> 07:28.072
You know what it is?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.991
Yeah. It's Chaucer.
Illustrated.

07:30.074 --> 07:31.450
Basically porn,

07:31.534 --> 07:34.203
but you're allowed to read it
on a train. Why?

07:34.287 --> 07:37.373
That young lady would like
to see the porn.

07:43.838 --> 07:45.006
Okay.

07:48.301 --> 07:50.469
Hi. Can I help you?

07:55.099 --> 07:57.685
HENRY, Uh, The Kelmscott
Press Chaucer, right?

08:01.606 --> 08:02.982
-Henry.
-HENRY, Oh...

08:04.358 --> 08:05.776
hello.

08:06.903 --> 08:09.155
-Sorry I-- I don't know--
-Clare.

08:10.239 --> 08:11.282
Abshire.

08:13.618 --> 08:14.785
Clare Abshire.

08:17.121 --> 08:18.206
You okay?

08:19.874 --> 08:22.293
I think so, yeah, why?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.837
Uh, you've got a, kinda look
on your face.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.422
-What kind of a look?
-HENRY, Um...

08:26.505 --> 08:28.299
Trying to think of a better word
than concussion.

08:29.008 --> 08:31.260
Sorry. I, uh...

08:31.344 --> 08:34.305
I wasn't expecting
to meet you today, um.

08:34.388 --> 08:36.891
I mean definitely not
in a library. Wh--

08:37.850 --> 08:39.018
You're a librarian?

08:40.228 --> 08:41.562
Well...

08:41.646 --> 08:43.314
-Yeah.
-A librarian.

08:43.397 --> 08:44.398
Uh-huh.

08:44.482 --> 08:46.651
CLARE, And your name
is DeTamble.

08:46.734 --> 08:48.903
That's gonna take
a bit of getting used to.

08:51.906 --> 08:53.699
Sorry, I--
I don't really understand--

08:53.783 --> 08:54.909
CLARE, You have a birthmark?

08:56.202 --> 08:57.912
Like a strawberry?

08:57.995 --> 09:00.748
Like you stood on a strawberry,
and squished it?

09:01.999 --> 09:03.125
On your left foot?

09:08.297 --> 09:10.675
Also, you've got a scar
just below your hairline.

09:10.758 --> 09:13.636
You can't see it right now,
your hair is too long.

09:13.719 --> 09:15.638
Actually, your hair
is really long.

09:15.721 --> 09:17.557
Is that on purpose?

09:17.640 --> 09:19.433
You've never told me
how you got the scar.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.936
I've asked, but I don't think
you like talking about it.

09:25.147 --> 09:27.108
So, we've met then?

09:27.191 --> 09:29.110
-Yes.

09:29.193 --> 09:32.280
Well, no. I've met you.

09:34.699 --> 09:37.576
I saw that birthmark
14 years ago.

09:37.660 --> 09:40.621
I've known you for 14 years,
and now...

09:40.705 --> 09:42.623
...you're standing there looking
like you've never

09:42.707 --> 09:44.417
-seen me before.
-I haven't.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.793
I know.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.088
You're so young.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.633
You're younger
than I've ever seen you.

09:56.679 --> 10:00.182
Okay, do you understand
why I don't recognize you?

10:00.266 --> 10:02.226
-Yes.
-So, you know about my,

10:02.310 --> 10:05.521
-uh, you know...
-Problem. Yes.

10:05.604 --> 10:07.315
-HENRY, Who told you?
-You told me.

10:08.941 --> 10:11.319
Okay, we can't talk here,
we should get a coffee.

10:11.402 --> 10:12.987
-Or a drink.
-Okay, a drink.

10:13.654 --> 10:14.655
Dinner!

10:15.489 --> 10:16.949
That escalated quickly.

10:17.742 --> 10:18.784
Fourteen years.

10:23.914 --> 10:26.292
-So, tonight?
-Uh, yeah.

10:27.209 --> 10:28.961
-Yeah, tonight.
-HENRY, Yeah.

10:30.963 --> 10:32.381
Sorry, I'm not exactly sure
how to--

10:32.465 --> 10:34.091
No, me neither.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.843
Usually I'm pretty good
at reading women.

10:35.926 --> 10:37.303
-Women?
-Uh, people.

10:38.054 --> 10:39.096
Both.

10:40.097 --> 10:41.849
Okay.

10:43.476 --> 10:44.644
Yeah, later.

10:46.937 --> 10:47.938
Both.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.606
All right.

12:50.603 --> 12:52.730
-Hi.
-CLARE, Hi.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.982
You've never brought me
flowers before.

12:55.065 --> 12:57.651
-Do you think that's gonna work?
-Work in what sense? I mean...

12:57.735 --> 13:00.362
...what
are we trying to achieve?

13:00.446 --> 13:02.364
Is this a date?
Are we on a date right now?

13:06.076 --> 13:07.286
What's that?

13:07.369 --> 13:10.789
Dates, 152 of them.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.094
A hundred and fifty-two.

13:28.057 --> 13:29.225
Have you been in a fight?

13:29.308 --> 13:31.936
Sure. How do you think
I got the flowers?

13:32.019 --> 13:33.062
Uh...

13:35.189 --> 13:38.025
Who uh...
who wrote this list?

13:38.108 --> 13:42.821
Me. When I was a kid.
You, uh, you dictated it to me.

13:42.905 --> 13:44.198
-I did?
-Mm-hmm.

13:46.951 --> 13:48.786
So, I'd know
when you'd be showing up.

13:48.869 --> 13:51.372
Oh, you told me a few years ago
that you memorized it

13:51.455 --> 13:53.207
from the list that
I'm giving you now,

13:53.290 --> 13:56.168
which you dictated to me
in the first place so,

13:56.252 --> 13:58.087
I'm really not too sure
how the information

13:58.170 --> 13:59.755
even exists.
It's just like some kind

13:59.838 --> 14:02.258
-of Möbius list--
-Okay, just stop! Please.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.386
Just slow down.

14:05.469 --> 14:08.013
Sorry, it's, uh, it's confusing.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.349
I've had longer
to think about it.

14:10.432 --> 14:12.518
So, has this never happened
to you before?

14:12.601 --> 14:14.311
Like meeting someone
in the wrong order?

14:14.395 --> 14:15.604
HENRY, No.

14:15.688 --> 14:18.232
CLARE, Didn't he warn you
about this kind of thing?

14:18.315 --> 14:20.359
-Didn't who warn me?
-The guy who trained you.

14:21.652 --> 14:23.404
I know there was a guy who,

14:23.487 --> 14:25.364
like taught you
all the time-travel stuff.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.032
Like all the rules,
when you were little.

14:27.116 --> 14:28.659
Another time traveler.

14:28.742 --> 14:32.621
-Did I tell you who it was?
-Not so far. No.

14:35.666 --> 14:37.293
-Right.

14:42.715 --> 14:45.301
So...
...getting this straight.

14:45.384 --> 14:46.844
-Hmm.
-HENRY, In the future...

14:46.927 --> 14:50.472
...in my future I'm gonna start

14:50.556 --> 14:52.516
-showing up in your past.
-Yes.

14:52.600 --> 14:53.642
For 14 years.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.811
One hundred and fifty-two times.

14:55.894 --> 14:57.730
Uh, how old was I? Back then?

14:57.813 --> 15:01.442
I mean, oldest I've seen you
is like 40 something.

15:01.525 --> 15:03.694
And youngest... maybe about 30.

15:04.695 --> 15:06.322
-How old are you now?
-Uh...

15:07.031 --> 15:08.115
I'm 28.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.286
You look so different.

15:12.369 --> 15:15.748
It's like you've been all,
tightened, you know.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.166
Renovated.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.336
-That must be kind of weird?
-Hot.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.837
-Hot?
-Yeah, hot.

15:21.920 --> 15:23.005
Somebody pimped my date.

15:23.088 --> 15:24.923
Is that what we're doing here?
We're on a date?

15:25.007 --> 15:26.342
-Yes.
-Like a date-date?

15:26.425 --> 15:28.427
-Yes.
-Oh, how am I doing?

15:28.510 --> 15:30.429
-Astonishingly well.
-Oh.

15:30.512 --> 15:31.722
Well, I mean, about as well

15:31.805 --> 15:33.349
as it's possible
for a human being

15:33.432 --> 15:35.225
-to do, in fact.

15:35.309 --> 15:37.645
Great.

15:41.440 --> 15:42.483
No more questions?

15:42.566 --> 15:44.693
Hmm, all of a sudden,
I'm distracted.

15:45.861 --> 15:47.488
Concentrate.

15:47.571 --> 15:49.031
-Ask me something.
-HENRY, Okay.

15:51.158 --> 15:52.743
Why you?

15:52.826 --> 15:54.912
Why would I go
see you so many times?

15:56.747 --> 15:58.415
We're gonna have to come back
to that one.

15:58.499 --> 16:01.418
-But there is a reason?
-There's a reason. Yeah.

16:02.795 --> 16:03.921
Next question.

16:06.131 --> 16:07.216
Okay, uh...

16:08.634 --> 16:10.427
Any hobbies? Any favorite books?

16:10.511 --> 16:13.889
Any unusual sexual proclivities
I should be aware of?

16:13.972 --> 16:15.516
One.

16:16.684 --> 16:17.810
What's that?

16:18.477 --> 16:19.687
I'm going to marry you.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.236
I was gonna build up to that.
But, uh...

16:28.320 --> 16:29.363
there it is.

16:30.823 --> 16:33.242
I'm your future wife.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.160
-Who said it?
-CLARE, You do.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.746
You told me.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.707
You explained,
you were visiting me

16:39.790 --> 16:42.960
from a time in the future,
when we're married.

16:43.043 --> 16:46.797
I'm sorry, I-- I don't mean to,
uh, spring it on you like that,

16:46.880 --> 16:49.550
but, in the future,
we're a married couple.

16:55.973 --> 16:57.474
Congratulations.

16:59.059 --> 17:00.728
-Seriously? Congratulations?
-What--

17:00.811 --> 17:02.771
-What am I supposed to say?
-Ah, you don't think much
of yourself, do you?

17:02.855 --> 17:04.732
I don't know,
I can't even begin to answer
something like--

17:04.815 --> 17:06.900
-"Congratulations" though?
-There is literally no precedent

17:06.984 --> 17:08.819
-for this conversation
-That's for sure.

17:08.902 --> 17:10.946
I'm sorry, it's just a lot to--
to process.

17:11.029 --> 17:12.865
Take my hand
when you say process.

17:14.825 --> 17:16.243
-I've been married?
-Yes.

17:16.326 --> 17:17.494
-You're my...
-Yes, I am.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.914
-You're my wife?
-Your future wife. Yes.

17:20.998 --> 17:23.375
I met you four hours ago,
we haven't even ordered yet.

17:26.044 --> 17:31.258
I know. I know. I do.
I mean I-- I get it.

17:31.341 --> 17:34.428
I get it. It's like
14 years for me.

17:34.511 --> 17:37.723
Just earlier today for you,
it's-- it's a lot.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.475
HENRY, Yeah.

17:40.601 --> 17:45.147
-So, ask me questions.

17:45.230 --> 17:47.316
Okay, well.

17:47.399 --> 17:50.110
Seeing as we're gonna
be married, and, uh,

17:50.194 --> 17:51.862
no offence, I've only got
your word for that.

17:51.945 --> 17:54.406
Well, technically, I've only got
your word for that,

17:54.490 --> 17:57.826
but, if you think about it
what does any couple ever have--

17:57.910 --> 17:59.745
-Please, don't do that.
-Do what?

17:59.828 --> 18:01.789
Swallow, when I say
the word "couple."

18:01.872 --> 18:03.540
-Did I just swallow?
-CLARE, Yeah, audibly.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.584
-The next table looked over.
-Oh.

18:07.711 --> 18:10.088
So, come on, questions.

18:14.676 --> 18:15.719
How did we meet?

18:18.889 --> 18:21.433
You mean, how was it for me?

18:58.470 --> 18:59.596
Hmm.

19:21.702 --> 19:22.744
CLARE, Mark.

19:23.704 --> 19:25.080
Mark, is that you?

19:29.293 --> 19:30.586
This is my place.

19:30.669 --> 19:32.588
You're not supposed
to come here.

19:46.685 --> 19:47.728
HENRY, Ow!

19:51.481 --> 19:53.317
Hello, Clare.

19:53.400 --> 19:55.903
-Who are you?
-HENRY, Well, it's Henry.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.821
Henry?

19:57.905 --> 19:59.907
HENRY, Yeah, I'm just, uh,
being sick.

19:59.990 --> 20:02.034
Travelling makes me sick
sometimes, you know that.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.953
Who are you?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.872
HENRY, Uh, don't you
know me yet, Clare?

20:06.955 --> 20:08.415
Haven't we met yet?

20:08.498 --> 20:10.417
-No.
-HENRY, Oh, well.

20:10.500 --> 20:13.795
That's okay. That's okay.
Uh, 'cause you're meeting me now

20:13.879 --> 20:15.130
and you know I'm a friend, okay?

20:15.213 --> 20:18.091
I promise you I'm a friend.
My name's Henry.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.719
I don't have any friends
called Henry.

20:20.802 --> 20:22.763
HENRY, Well, you do now.

20:22.846 --> 20:25.432
Hey, could you do me a favor
and go and get me some clothes?

20:25.515 --> 20:26.516
Why?

20:26.600 --> 20:27.809
HENRY,
'Cause I don't have any.

20:27.893 --> 20:30.812
And I bet you are amazing
at choosing clothes.

20:42.032 --> 20:43.617
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:43.700 --> 20:46.078
What's all this
running around indoors?

20:46.161 --> 20:48.872
Nell, you know
what an imaginary friend is.

20:48.956 --> 20:50.540
-True.
-I found one in the woods

20:50.624 --> 20:52.918
and I'm gonna dress him up
'cause he's naked.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.508
-CLARE, Hi.
-Hi.

21:11.144 --> 21:12.562
So, right there.

21:12.646 --> 21:15.315
Yeah, just label it,
Earth's axis.

21:15.399 --> 21:16.400
Oh, okay.

21:16.483 --> 21:19.194
-Earth's axis.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.750
HENRY, Okay, I'm ready.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.718
-CLARE, That was quick.
-I've had a lot of practice.

22:26.553 --> 22:28.555
You're bleeding.

22:28.638 --> 22:31.516
-Well, you threw a shoe at me.
-I'm not saying sorry.

22:31.600 --> 22:32.684
Why should you?

22:33.477 --> 22:35.312
What's that mark?

22:35.395 --> 22:37.397
HENRY, Oh, that?
That's just a birthmark.

22:37.481 --> 22:38.690
Don't worry, it doesn't hurt.

22:40.484 --> 22:43.278
It looks like you stood
on a strawberry and squished it.

22:44.404 --> 22:45.614
Someone else said that.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.408
No.

22:48.492 --> 22:51.495
-What's wrong?
-Well, it wasn't someone else.

22:55.040 --> 22:57.084
Have you seen dinosaurs?

22:57.167 --> 22:59.586
I tickled
a dinosaur's tummy once.

22:59.669 --> 23:02.339
Twice actually, but it was
in the Natural History Museum.

23:02.881 --> 23:04.466
Real ones.

23:04.549 --> 23:07.803
Well, I travel in time,
but not that far back.

23:07.886 --> 23:10.472
I tend to stay in the same time
since I was born.

23:10.555 --> 23:13.767
-Is that not dinosaurs?
-No, Clare.

23:13.850 --> 23:15.268
That is not dinosaurs.

23:16.061 --> 23:17.687
Do you have kids in the future?

23:18.688 --> 23:19.773
Uh...

23:20.941 --> 23:22.109
No. I'm afraid not.

23:23.026 --> 23:24.277
Do you have a wife?

23:25.445 --> 23:26.988
-Yeah
-Is she pretty?

23:27.072 --> 23:29.282
-She's very pretty.
-What's her name?

23:29.366 --> 23:32.410
Well, funnily enough,
her name's Clare.

23:32.494 --> 23:35.372
-Like me.
-Yeah. Like you.

23:35.455 --> 23:37.541
Was it love at first sight?

23:37.624 --> 23:40.335
-God, I hope not.
-Do you kiss her?

23:40.418 --> 23:43.588
-Uh... ...yeah.
-Why?

23:45.340 --> 23:49.511
Because it's nice,
and because I love her.

23:49.594 --> 23:51.263
Why do you like kissing people?

23:51.346 --> 23:53.140
Why do you like brushing
your horse's hair?

23:53.223 --> 23:57.644
It's not brushing,
I'm grooming her.

23:57.727 --> 24:00.480
Okay, moving on. Uh, Clare,

24:00.564 --> 24:02.858
in a little while,
I'm gonna disappear.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.734
-Can I watch?
-Yeah, you can.

24:04.818 --> 24:06.319
But I'd like you to do me
a little favor.

24:06.403 --> 24:08.113
See when I go, I'm gonna leave
my clothes behind.

24:08.196 --> 24:10.657
But I'd like you to take them,
and put them somewhere safe.

24:10.740 --> 24:12.659
Maybe, um, under this rock.

24:12.742 --> 24:14.619
And if you could put them
in a box for me,

24:14.703 --> 24:17.247
-they'll be nice and dry.
-Are you coming back?

24:17.330 --> 24:19.666
Yeah, I'll be back
lots of times.

24:19.749 --> 24:21.793
Some of those times
have already happened for me,

24:21.877 --> 24:24.462
you'll see me looking younger.
Maybe older.

24:24.546 --> 24:26.423
Can't you bring
your own clothes?

24:26.506 --> 24:28.717
I can't bring anything.
Those are the rules.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.552
Why are there rules?

24:30.635 --> 24:32.554
-I don't know.
-Who told you the rules?

24:34.014 --> 24:35.724
You ask a lot of questions,
don't you?

24:35.807 --> 24:37.225
-You said I could.
-Well,

24:37.309 --> 24:38.768
the very first time
it happened to me,

24:38.852 --> 24:41.646
-there was, uh, a man.
-Who?

24:42.355 --> 24:43.815
Another...

24:43.899 --> 24:47.611
another time traveler, but,
it's a very long story, Clare.

24:47.694 --> 24:48.737
Good.

24:49.779 --> 24:50.947
I like stories.

24:54.367 --> 24:56.578
Come on, Henry.
It's closing in a minute.

24:57.746 --> 25:00.123
-And Chicago's...

25:00.207 --> 25:01.625
Come on, you two. Let's go.

25:01.708 --> 25:03.543
We will be closing shortly.

25:03.627 --> 25:06.713
Please make your way
toward the exit at this time.

25:06.796 --> 25:09.132
-Ah!
-RICHARD, Let's go.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.176
What do you think, Henry?
First museum, you like it?

25:11.259 --> 25:12.844
-Mm-hmm.
-Oh, he loved it.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.429
-Didn't you, Henry?
-Mm-hmm.

25:14.512 --> 25:15.513
HENRY, Yeah.

25:15.597 --> 25:16.973
...toward the exit at this time.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.066
-Can we go back?
-Of course, we can.

25:26.149 --> 25:29.444
-Tonight?
-Soon.

25:34.157 --> 25:35.283
Sleep tight.

25:56.096 --> 25:57.639
-HENRY, Hey, kid! Henry.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.599
Put this on.

25:59.683 --> 26:02.435
You've time traveled back,
about three hours.

26:02.519 --> 26:03.895
There's a trash can
in front of you.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.689
Now, I say that because
in a minute,

26:06.356 --> 26:07.524
you're gonna be sick.

26:14.364 --> 26:16.574
How did you know I'd be sick?

26:16.658 --> 26:18.285
'Cause I'm a time traveler, too.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.747
I've had a lot of practice.

26:23.832 --> 26:25.917
Thought you might look
a bit more surprised.

26:26.001 --> 26:28.461
-About what?
-Suddenly showing up here.

26:28.545 --> 26:30.088
It's my first museum.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.173
I thought I might have a dream
about it.

26:32.257 --> 26:34.467
Sorry, Henry, no.
This isn't a dream.

26:35.510 --> 26:38.179
-Do you work here?
-No, I don't work here.

26:38.263 --> 26:41.349
I stole these clothes
like I stole you that t-shirt.

26:41.433 --> 26:43.184
See, I time travel, too.

26:43.268 --> 26:46.646
You came back about three hours.
I came back, uh...

26:47.772 --> 26:50.400
-Remind me, what year is this?
-1987.

26:51.151 --> 26:53.278
Yeah, 21 years.

26:55.530 --> 26:57.615
Are there lots of time
travelers?

27:00.827 --> 27:04.039
Hey, big guy.
Hey, how you doing up there?

27:06.082 --> 27:07.792
Tickle, tickle, tickle.

27:09.294 --> 27:11.838
He's not really ticklish,
is he? You wanna try?

27:12.881 --> 27:13.882
Come on.

27:14.758 --> 27:16.718
Whoop!

27:16.801 --> 27:21.097
No sense of humor.
No wonder they all died out.

27:24.684 --> 27:28.480
When do I meet the other ones?
The other time travelers.

27:30.482 --> 27:31.941
You're hungry now, right?

27:32.025 --> 27:34.152
Time travel always makes you
hungry. Come on.

27:50.835 --> 27:51.920
HENRY, Okay.

27:52.837 --> 27:53.838
Eat up.

27:55.048 --> 27:56.925
In a minute you're gonna feel
a little sick again

27:57.008 --> 27:58.718
and then you're gonna snap
right back home.

27:58.802 --> 27:59.844
That's how it works.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.931
-HENRY, Okay.

28:08.645 --> 28:10.105
So.

28:10.188 --> 28:12.107
Today's the day,
I'm gonna start teaching you.

28:12.190 --> 28:16.152
I must be feeling very grown up.

28:16.236 --> 28:18.113
-How do I get back home?

28:19.364 --> 28:20.532
It'll just happen.

28:21.658 --> 28:23.243
Sometimes you don't go
straight back.

28:23.326 --> 28:24.869
You go to another time first.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.246
Once I went
to three different times

28:26.329 --> 28:29.499
in a row, but mostly you ping
straight back home.

28:29.582 --> 28:31.835
-Can I go to the future, too?
-Yeah.

28:31.918 --> 28:34.254
Sometimes.
Not so often, but it happens.

28:35.463 --> 28:36.631
What do we do?

28:36.714 --> 28:38.299
What do you mean,
"What do we do?"

28:40.718 --> 28:43.471
We're time travelers.
Do we solve crimes?

28:44.431 --> 28:47.308
Uh, no, Henry, sorry.

28:47.392 --> 28:50.395
We don't solve crimes,
we... ...commit them.

28:50.478 --> 28:53.148
We run, we steal, we fight.

28:56.025 --> 28:58.528
Wherever we show up in time,
we're naked...

28:58.611 --> 29:00.530
...and we're sick.
We don't get a choice.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.575
Are we the bad guys?

29:05.034 --> 29:06.703
Survivors are always
the bad guys.

29:07.495 --> 29:09.122
That's why it's my job,

29:09.205 --> 29:11.374
to teach you how to be
the baddest guy out there.

29:12.500 --> 29:14.252
So, I'm gonna see you again?

29:15.170 --> 29:16.421
Yeah, lots of times.

29:17.839 --> 29:21.718
-Do you promise?
-Yeah, I promise.

29:21.801 --> 29:25.305
In fact, when I was your age,
exactly your age,

29:25.388 --> 29:27.640
there was a guy who came back
in time and he trained me.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.143
So now,
it's my turn to train you.

29:30.226 --> 29:31.895
So, there's lots of us?

29:32.812 --> 29:33.897
Yeah.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.484
There's lots of us
time travelers.

29:38.026 --> 29:39.527
Good.

29:39.611 --> 29:42.113
How does that all sound, Henry?
Me training you.

29:44.115 --> 29:45.325
Scary.

29:45.408 --> 29:47.994
Well, the world's a scary place.

29:48.077 --> 29:51.206
So, you know what you gotta be?
You gotta be scarier.

29:52.373 --> 29:55.251
Yeah, suddenly I'm not sure.
I think that...

29:55.335 --> 29:59.130
I am having a very grown-up day.
What is up with that?

29:59.214 --> 30:02.258
-It's okay.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.385
You're going home. Next time.

30:11.643 --> 30:15.355
-Okay.

30:15.438 --> 30:18.483
-HENRY, Oh, shit.

30:24.239 --> 30:25.949
Oh, shit. Carry on.
Don't mind me.

30:26.032 --> 30:27.116
What the fuck are you doing?

30:27.200 --> 30:28.910
Now, just-- just give me
a moment, okay?

30:28.993 --> 30:30.870
-What the fuck?

30:30.954 --> 30:33.957
Yeah. Could you give me the date
and the time, please?

30:34.040 --> 30:35.917
-What are you saying?
-Uh, just the date

30:36.000 --> 30:38.169
and the fucking time,
that's all I need.

30:38.253 --> 30:42.674
Oh, shit. This is gonna be
a big one--

30:42.757 --> 30:45.426
-Uh... June 26.
-Thank you.

30:45.510 --> 30:47.136
Yeah, it's15 p.m.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.347
Shut up talking to him.
He's naked!

30:49.806 --> 30:51.266
2008?

30:51.349 --> 30:53.226
Huh, okay, okay. That's uh...

30:53.309 --> 30:55.478
I've been gone two hours,
my clothes won't still be here.

30:55.562 --> 30:57.272
-Your clothes?

30:57.355 --> 31:00.942
I'm gonna need yours.

31:01.025 --> 31:03.319
-You're gonna need what?
-This is gonna hurt.

31:03.778 --> 31:04.821
You, not me.

31:08.032 --> 31:11.035
-Oh, my God!

31:14.998 --> 31:16.040
Ah!

31:16.124 --> 31:19.252
-What's your name?
-Donna.

31:19.335 --> 31:22.297
HENRY, Uh, Donna.

31:22.380 --> 31:24.007
What's gonna happen now
is I'm gonna take

31:24.090 --> 31:26.467
your boyfriend's clothes
and just go.

31:26.551 --> 31:29.137
If you like, you can put him
in the recovery position

31:29.220 --> 31:30.305
and call the cops.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.098
Give them
my description by all means,

31:32.181 --> 31:35.310
but I'm naked, you'll find
details surprisingly difficult

31:35.393 --> 31:37.478
to remember.

31:37.562 --> 31:38.980
Did he give you those flowers?

31:40.189 --> 31:42.442
-Yeah.
-Oh, that's nice.

31:42.525 --> 31:44.444
-He doesn't seem like the type.

31:44.527 --> 31:45.778
Seeing as he's kind
of an asshole

31:45.862 --> 31:47.864
and this is a shitty date
anyway.

31:47.947 --> 31:51.743
Mind if I take them?
I'm late for someone.

31:51.826 --> 31:53.828
-Hi.
-CLARE, Hi.

31:53.911 --> 31:56.122
You've never brought me
flowers before.

31:56.205 --> 31:59.042
-Do you think that's gonna work?
-No, I just think

31:59.125 --> 32:01.544
that your apartment
might be a bit nicer.

32:01.628 --> 32:04.005
-Well, what's wrong with yours?
-Well, I live in it.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.966
I live really badly in it,
it's like a farm for one human.

32:08.968 --> 32:10.928
You know it's funny,
I've known you almost

32:11.012 --> 32:14.807
all my life and you're not what
I was expecting.

32:14.891 --> 32:16.017
Am I a disappointment?

32:16.100 --> 32:20.647
No, no. Oh, you're just uh--
Well, you're different.

32:20.730 --> 32:22.523
Well, different good or bad?

32:23.399 --> 32:24.442
Just different.

32:28.071 --> 32:30.490
Oh, no. It's got a lot worse.

32:30.573 --> 32:33.868
You are gonna have to count
to a million.

32:33.951 --> 32:37.705
Eighty-five,
86, 87...

32:37.789 --> 32:41.542
...88, 89, 90,
hurry up.

32:41.626 --> 32:44.504
-Keep counting.
-Jesus! Fourteen years.

32:44.587 --> 32:46.047
Count, come on.
Count, count, count.

32:46.130 --> 32:48.841
Ninety, 91,

32:48.925 --> 32:50.718
92, 93...

32:50.802 --> 32:55.807
-...94, 95, 96,

32:56.349 --> 32:58.935
97, 98.

33:02.730 --> 33:05.692
-You still there?
-Yeah, one more minute.

33:05.775 --> 33:09.320
-Count, come on.
-Ninety-- I mean where? What?

33:09.404 --> 33:11.489
Ninety-seven, 98,

33:12.407 --> 33:16.411
-99, 100.
-Shit.

33:16.494 --> 33:20.123
CLARE, One hundred and one,
102, 103,

33:20.540 --> 33:23.209
104, 105,

33:23.292 --> 33:26.838
-106, 107...

33:26.921 --> 33:30.425
CLARE,...108, 109, 110.

33:59.620 --> 34:01.622
This is not the apartment
of a grown-up.

34:01.706 --> 34:03.040
Oh, that's not fair.

34:04.208 --> 34:05.918
This is the most grown-up
I've ever been.

34:24.395 --> 34:25.980
Always been me
who makes that move.

34:26.063 --> 34:28.274
Yeah, it never will be again.

34:35.740 --> 34:37.241
Wait, is that what I think
it is?

34:40.036 --> 34:42.079
Oh, yeah. That's one
of my baby teeth.

34:42.163 --> 34:45.541
-Wait, you kept your baby teeth?
-No, it just appeared.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.668
It'll go in a minute.
Back under my pillow

34:47.752 --> 34:49.170
from when I was a kid.

34:49.253 --> 34:52.840
All of me time travels.
Even my nail clippings.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.343
-Hmm, that's gross.
-You know what's even grosser?

34:55.426 --> 34:56.928
The haircut
that follows you home.

34:57.011 --> 34:59.347
-Is that why you keep it long?
-Well, I like it long.

35:00.264 --> 35:02.183
And, uh, sometimes...

35:02.266 --> 35:03.559
I should probably
warn you about this,

35:03.643 --> 35:06.020
sometimes there's blood.

35:06.103 --> 35:08.648
Just, like, a pool of blood.
Which means somewhere out there,

35:08.731 --> 35:11.067
in another time,
I've been hurt, or,

35:11.150 --> 35:12.568
you know,
maybe I got a nosebleed--

35:12.652 --> 35:15.154
-I know.

35:15.238 --> 35:18.241
-Wait, you know. How?
-I, uh, one time, I--

35:18.324 --> 35:20.493
-I assumed--
-Uh, no. Stop, stop, stop.

35:20.576 --> 35:23.162
If it's something I'm not
supposed to know yet, it's...

35:23.246 --> 35:24.622
probably best I don't.

35:25.790 --> 35:27.542
That's what you said
the last time.

35:28.751 --> 35:29.794
Good old me.

35:33.047 --> 35:35.258
Why aren't you
permanently terrified?

35:37.134 --> 35:39.303
There's always gonna
be days that you bleed, right?

35:39.387 --> 35:41.889
That's true
for everyone, not just me.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.935
All you can do is be happy
it's not today.

35:47.311 --> 35:48.604
-Henry.
-Yeah.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.857
It's not today.

35:56.779 --> 35:58.698
Wow, she's forceful, isn't she?

35:58.781 --> 36:01.576
Mm-hmm. Well, I decided we need
a change of mood.

36:01.659 --> 36:03.286
Yeah. Do you always get
what you want?

36:03.369 --> 36:05.454
Oh, always, I mean,
I am horrible.

36:05.538 --> 36:07.623
It's okay, you're horrible, too.

36:07.707 --> 36:09.041
-I'm horrible?
-Yeah.

36:09.125 --> 36:13.045
You have been a perfect
gentleman for 14 years.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.256
-Are you sure that was me?
-Yeah, homework,

36:15.339 --> 36:19.427
board games, heart-to-hearts,
French verbs, and checkers.

36:19.510 --> 36:21.220
You have been unbearable company

36:21.304 --> 36:22.930
throughout a very horny
adolescence.

36:23.014 --> 36:24.891
-It was a whirlwind.

36:24.974 --> 36:27.018
Well, you know, you were a kid.

36:33.107 --> 36:34.233
Haven't I grown?

36:37.194 --> 36:39.238
-I'm not the only one.

36:40.531 --> 36:41.824
-You think?
-Yeah.

36:43.743 --> 36:46.662
I'd say, tall enough
to do the scary rides

36:46.746 --> 36:48.205
at Disney without a parent.

36:49.624 --> 36:51.667
Oh, Henry! You're so young!

37:14.190 --> 37:15.441
-Hey.
-Hey.

37:15.524 --> 37:17.193
I'm going to the bathroom.

37:17.276 --> 37:19.528
-Okay. It's over there.

37:19.612 --> 37:21.697
I fully understand
if you put the lights on.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.491
-Hmm, why?
-CLARE, Hmm.

37:25.159 --> 37:27.662
-I'm naked.
-Oh, yeah.

37:28.829 --> 37:29.997
Good tip. Thanks.

38:00.361 --> 38:03.489
For the record, Henry.
For future reference,

38:03.572 --> 38:07.284
the bottom drawer
was the very first one
I looked in.

38:07.368 --> 38:08.619
-Uh--

38:08.703 --> 38:10.454
I'm not going to ask her name,
I don't need to know.

38:10.538 --> 38:12.248
-Okay.
-CLARE,
That's your business.

38:12.331 --> 38:14.834
HENRY, Uh, it's not like you
asked if I was seeing anyone.

38:14.917 --> 38:17.169
Uh, yeah. But you are allowed
to mention the fact.

38:17.253 --> 38:20.381
Preferably somewhere between
the restaurant and the mattress.

38:20.464 --> 38:22.049
I didn't wanna do that
for a very good reason.

38:22.133 --> 38:23.926
-CLARE, Oh, which was?
-I really wanted to have

38:24.010 --> 38:26.095
-sex with you.
-Oh! What, are you joking now?

38:26.178 --> 38:28.139
-You trying to be funny?
-Bit funny, bit flattering.

38:28.222 --> 38:29.724
Flattering? Jesus!

38:29.807 --> 38:30.975
-HENRY, Ingrid.
-What?

38:31.058 --> 38:33.853
Her name is Ingrid
and she's my girlfriend.

38:33.936 --> 38:36.313
Well, bad luck, Ingrid,
'cause I'm here now.

38:36.397 --> 38:38.482
Jesus Christ,
do you know how you sound?

38:38.566 --> 38:40.067
How I sound? How I sound?

38:40.151 --> 38:41.485
I've never seen you before
in my life,

38:41.569 --> 38:42.945
and now you're telling me
you're my wife.

38:43.029 --> 38:44.947
Doesn't that sound a tiny bit
scary mad to you?

38:45.031 --> 38:47.158
Well, if I'm a scary mad person,
why did you have sex with me?

38:47.241 --> 38:49.118
Well, to be honest I'd
never need that good a reason.

38:49.201 --> 38:50.327
-Fuck you!

38:50.411 --> 38:52.204
So, you're happy
to fuck crazy women?

38:52.288 --> 38:54.415
Well, it would seriously
limit my options if I wasn't.

38:54.498 --> 38:55.708
-Wouldn't it!
-Fuck you!

38:55.791 --> 38:58.711
None of which means
I don't wanna see you again.

38:58.794 --> 39:01.047
-When will I see you again?
-Soon. Six days.

39:01.130 --> 39:02.923
September 29th.
Now, don't worry.

39:03.007 --> 39:05.051
I always get like this
when I'm about to disappear.

39:05.134 --> 39:07.386
But you'll get used to it.
You'll see it lots of times.

39:07.470 --> 39:09.597
Bring a notebook next time,
I'll give you a list of dates--

39:19.648 --> 39:22.485
Fuck.

39:27.073 --> 39:28.783
-CLARE,- Fuck you!
-HENRY,- Ah! Jesus Christ...

39:28.866 --> 39:30.409
CLARE, So, you're happy
to fuck crazy women?

39:30.493 --> 39:32.870
HENRY, Well,
it would seriously limit
my options if I wasn't.

39:32.953 --> 39:33.954
CLARE, Fuck you!

39:34.038 --> 39:36.123
-Fuck, fuck, fuck...

39:36.207 --> 39:38.167
-Fucking men.

39:45.633 --> 39:47.134
Fucking asshole.

39:48.052 --> 39:49.178
-HENRY, Clare!
-Clare!

39:49.261 --> 39:50.429
-Asshole.

39:51.972 --> 39:53.557
-Asshole.

39:56.268 --> 39:57.436
Asshole.

40:11.992 --> 40:13.119
Here you go.

40:15.454 --> 40:16.455
Thank you.

40:25.756 --> 40:27.508
-Hey.
-No.

40:45.526 --> 40:46.569
No.

40:48.529 --> 40:51.282
HENRY, Well, I didn't mean
any of those things I said.

40:54.952 --> 40:56.579
Yeah, you did.

40:56.662 --> 40:58.205
HENRY,
So, I ran all the way here

40:58.289 --> 40:59.874
to tell you that,
but then, uh...

41:01.458 --> 41:03.711
being stupid, I just stood
outside and watched you

41:03.794 --> 41:05.588
at the window
for about ten minutes.

41:05.671 --> 41:08.716
Ten minutes?
I only just sat down.

41:16.015 --> 41:17.016
Hi.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.859
How are
those French verbs coming?

41:30.446 --> 41:33.157
-I've missed you.
-Well, you just slept with me.

41:33.240 --> 41:37.745
-No. No, I didn't.
-Hey, come on.

41:37.828 --> 41:39.580
You just got yourself
a new young man.

41:39.663 --> 41:41.207
What kind of guy
do you think I am?

41:41.290 --> 41:42.875
As it turns out, an asshole.

41:44.376 --> 41:46.086
Was that the big secret,
you were keeping from me

41:46.170 --> 41:49.089
all these years?
You're a secret asshole?

41:49.840 --> 41:51.175
It's kind of every man's secret.

41:55.012 --> 41:56.680
-Was that me?
-Oh.

41:57.806 --> 42:00.893
Yeah. The first time
you threw a shoe at me.

42:02.853 --> 42:05.105
CLARE, I'm still not sorry.

42:05.189 --> 42:08.400
I grew up waiting for you.
Longing for you.

42:08.484 --> 42:10.152
-I know.
-No, you don't.

42:12.321 --> 42:16.575
I formed myself around you.
The idea of you.

42:18.077 --> 42:19.912
And you're an asshole.

42:22.790 --> 42:24.917
-Well here's the thing.

42:25.751 --> 42:27.920
The man you formed
yourself around,

42:28.003 --> 42:30.756
shock twist,
formed himself around you.

42:30.839 --> 42:32.800
-That's fucked up.
-Yep. So fucked up,

42:32.883 --> 42:35.135
it has a name. Marriage.

42:37.346 --> 42:39.390
Two people trying to be
the person the other one

42:39.473 --> 42:41.767
already thinks they are.
Love, basically.

42:41.850 --> 42:43.227
You didn't hear
what he just said.

42:43.310 --> 42:47.439
Clare, I said what he just said.
You wanna know why I said it?

42:47.523 --> 42:50.734
Because time travel is awful.
It is shit scary.

42:50.818 --> 42:52.611
It is waiting for the next storm
to hit.

42:52.695 --> 42:54.321
Wondering if this time
it's gonna kill you.

42:54.405 --> 42:57.116
That boy out there.
Time travel has never

42:57.199 --> 42:58.826
done one nice thing for him.

43:00.869 --> 43:02.329
Until today.

43:02.413 --> 43:04.915
Today he gets the winning
lottery ticket.

43:04.999 --> 43:07.501
-So, why is he being such--
-You know, what's even worse,

43:07.585 --> 43:09.461
than being terrified
all the time?

43:10.462 --> 43:11.505
The future.

43:12.589 --> 43:14.258
The future is the scariest thing
in the world.

43:14.341 --> 43:16.093
Because suddenly,
you are all in.

43:17.303 --> 43:20.180
-No choice.

43:20.264 --> 43:23.517
Anyone can stand any kind
of torture, except hope.

43:23.600 --> 43:25.060
Why didn't he just say all that?

43:27.146 --> 43:28.188
He did.

43:29.356 --> 43:31.483
It just took me a while.

43:40.200 --> 43:42.870
-That's a shit jacket.

43:43.245 --> 43:44.330
Well...

43:44.413 --> 43:49.877
Muggers can't be choosers.

43:49.960 --> 43:51.879
And now you're off home.

43:51.962 --> 43:55.382
In a minute, yeah.

43:55.466 --> 43:58.719
-To older me?
-To my wife.

43:58.802 --> 44:00.804
-Bitch.
-HENRY, Sorry?

44:00.888 --> 44:03.807
Older me gets you.
And I get younger you,

44:03.891 --> 44:05.017
who's a dick. It's not fair.

44:05.100 --> 44:07.561
No, he's not a dick.
And you know that.

44:07.644 --> 44:08.687
He's not you.

44:10.856 --> 44:13.317
Seriously,
how does he get to be you?

44:14.109 --> 44:15.527
What happens to him? Does he--

44:15.611 --> 44:17.237
Does he get hit
by a fucking meteorite?

44:17.321 --> 44:19.073
Yeah, going by the name
of Clare.

44:22.534 --> 44:23.702
That a compliment?

44:23.786 --> 44:25.829
I just called you a meteorite.
Take it any way you like.

44:28.207 --> 44:32.252
Hey. Look on the bright side.
He is way hotter than me.

44:33.337 --> 44:35.047
-No, he's not.
-Sure, he is.

44:41.512 --> 44:44.723
It's okay. I don't mind.
In fact, I agree with you.

44:44.807 --> 44:45.933
I've fucked him, too.

44:49.812 --> 44:51.438
I'll have a whiskey and soda.

45:01.073 --> 45:02.533
-Henry.
-Henry.

45:03.242 --> 45:04.910
-How's Ingrid?
-Good.

45:04.993 --> 45:07.746
Might go see her tonight, since
this isn't working out.

45:07.830 --> 45:09.665
I thought it was working out
pretty well already.

45:09.748 --> 45:11.291
Mind your own business.

45:11.834 --> 45:13.544
Hey!

45:13.627 --> 45:15.504
-Not that I'd ever offer advice.
-God forbid.

45:15.587 --> 45:17.339
HENRY, But a boring old man
told me something

45:17.423 --> 45:18.757
a very long time ago.

45:18.841 --> 45:20.759
He said you have two things to
do with your time on this Earth.

45:20.843 --> 45:24.138
One, find the love of your life.
Two, die as slowly as possible.

45:24.221 --> 45:26.640
You did part one tonight.
Part two starts now.

45:26.723 --> 45:28.600
Play time is over.

45:28.684 --> 45:30.477
Do you ever get bored
of hearing yourself talk?

45:30.561 --> 45:32.396
I don't know.
You tell me.

45:33.188 --> 45:35.524
No more time to waste, junior.

45:35.607 --> 45:37.526
You've seen the blood,
you know something's coming.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.654
-Yeah. But not today.

45:40.737 --> 45:43.449
Oh. Time for you
to fuck off then.

45:43.532 --> 45:45.033
-Get a haircut.

46:40.297 --> 46:42.591
-When were you?

46:49.556 --> 46:51.433
-Oh.

46:52.309 --> 46:54.228
I'm sorry
I threw my shoe at you.

46:57.856 --> 46:59.858
-Well, it's about time.
-Hmm.

47:37.729 --> 47:38.730
Hello.

47:40.148 --> 47:41.149
Henry?

48:02.212 --> 48:04.423
CLARE, Long ago,
men went to sea

48:04.506 --> 48:06.633
and women waited for them.

48:06.717 --> 48:08.677
Standing on the edge
of the water,

48:08.760 --> 48:11.179
scanning the horizon
for the tiny ship.

48:13.932 --> 48:17.185
Now, I wait for Henry.

48:21.189 --> 48:24.943
Not today.
Not today.

48:26.862 --> 48:29.281
I hate to be where she is not.

48:29.364 --> 48:32.326
And yet I'm always going
and she can't follow.

48:35.037 --> 48:37.706
Why does he always go
where I cannot follow?
