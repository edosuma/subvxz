00:54.480 --> 00:56.079
Help me, please!

00:58.960 --> 01:00.959
- What happened?
- Help me.

01:01.080 --> 01:04.679
I was attacked, they dumped me here,
my car won't start.

01:04.800 --> 01:06.239
Don't move, arsehole!

01:06.360 --> 01:08.999
Keep still, go back.

01:09.120 --> 01:10.639
Go back, eyes forward!

01:12.840 --> 01:14.519
Eyes forward!

01:19.800 --> 01:21.239
Get in!

01:25.040 --> 01:26.439
Shut it.

01:29.800 --> 01:31.799
Good girl.

01:31.920 --> 01:34.879
- I gotta go, Carmela's looking for me.
- Go.

02:23.040 --> 02:24.799
This stuff's ready.

03:00.360 --> 03:02.479
These are better than the originals.

03:02.600 --> 03:04.559
Whatever,
the Chinese don't understand shit.

03:04.680 --> 03:08.359
No, they're intelligent,
wherever they go they learn the trade.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.319
You're an idiot! They're all the same.

03:11.440 --> 03:14.519
They can't even recognise each other,
you think they can recognise drills?

03:16.680 --> 03:20.319
The Chinese girl who works
for my uncle, I recognise her perfectly.

03:20.440 --> 03:22.919
Pure 'n' Simple likes pussy!

03:23.040 --> 03:25.279
I'll twist your head off, get outta here.

03:29.960 --> 03:32.319
Two, four, five... that makes 15.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.079
Your wallet, please.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.039
Pasquale...

04:24.680 --> 04:27.639
When you report this,
you're gonna forget me, right?

04:28.760 --> 04:30.519
Don't make me come to your house.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.159
This is to buy your wife a dress.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.799
They really worked you over.

06:24.400 --> 06:26.119
Why'd you come back?

06:29.800 --> 06:31.359
I was homesick.

06:33.040 --> 06:35.079
But this isn't our house anymore.

06:36.440 --> 06:38.799
This city chewed us up and spat us out.

06:45.800 --> 06:49.039
They kicked me out of Secondigliano
like a sack of rubbish.

06:49.160 --> 06:50.479
Me!

06:52.360 --> 06:54.079
They all gotta die.

07:03.000 --> 07:04.919
Where are Azzurra and Pietro?

07:37.640 --> 07:39.399
Deborah was right.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.959
The last night I saw her

07:45.920 --> 07:47.719
she said, stop, Ciro.

07:49.240 --> 07:50.919
Think about us.

07:53.120 --> 07:54.839
But I didn't listen to her.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.879
I had to journey through hell
to understand.

08:27.200 --> 08:30.399
After everything they've done to us,
we're still here,

08:31.720 --> 08:33.359
just you and me.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.438
You gotta get them back.

08:43.559 --> 08:45.399
If you do it for them, I'm with you.

09:22.560 --> 09:23.959
Hey, handsome!

09:24.080 --> 09:27.919
- Blue Blood! 'Sup?
- All good, thank God.

09:30.240 --> 09:31.879
- You're good?
- Yeah.

09:33.080 --> 09:34.959
They just came in.

09:35.080 --> 09:37.399
- Show me.
- You wanna see 'em, eh?

09:46.320 --> 09:48.599
- Let's try.
- I got the same one at home.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.199
The only thing I haven't drilled
is my sister's head.

09:51.320 --> 09:53.559
It's as hard as marble.

09:55.080 --> 09:58.279
Luckily, in my town
the walls are made of shit.

09:59.720 --> 10:02.599
For people in my town,
as long as the brand's from the West...

10:03.600 --> 10:05.199
I'll take it, I like it.

10:16.120 --> 10:17.799
Guys, let's load up!

11:00.720 --> 11:02.719
Come in, I wanna show you something.

11:39.960 --> 11:43.039
There's 80,000 so now we're cool.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.359
There was no rush.

11:44.480 --> 11:47.479
A guy like you has to see
that I work with money in hand.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.959
What do you say?

11:52.080 --> 11:53.359
Not bad.

11:54.360 --> 11:56.359
Must have cost a ton.

11:57.480 --> 12:00.239
But with this
you only spend money once.

12:02.040 --> 12:04.639
There's even an irrigation system
with a thermostat.

12:06.680 --> 12:09.039
So, this is your business.

12:09.160 --> 12:10.399
And then?

12:10.520 --> 12:12.959
There's something even bigger,
know what it is?

12:15.840 --> 12:18.319
The emotional investment.

12:18.440 --> 12:21.039
To keep a dealing spot it takes brains,

12:21.160 --> 12:24.439
to keep these, you need this.

12:24.560 --> 12:27.159
I've learned to love these plants,

12:27.280 --> 12:29.679
I know how to grow them from A to Z.

12:29.800 --> 12:33.759
At three weeks, you need a light,
at six, another one, at nine, another.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.879
So, why is it all off now?

12:39.000 --> 12:40.239
They're sleeping.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.919
It's all regulated with a timer.

12:44.040 --> 12:46.239
A midnight, it all comes back on.

12:46.360 --> 12:49.199
How do you know when they wake up
and when they go to sleep?

12:52.920 --> 12:54.519
I know them very well.

13:01.040 --> 13:03.839
What do you wanna be, Enzo?

13:03.960 --> 13:05.359
A farmer?

13:08.080 --> 13:11.479
Or you wanna do something truly big
like you said?

13:15.360 --> 13:16.959
I wanna grow.

13:27.360 --> 13:29.039
I've been thinking.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.479
If you wanna make real money,
you need to listen to me.

13:36.160 --> 13:38.399
You gotta do everything I say.

14:20.680 --> 14:21.879
A coffee.

14:36.600 --> 14:37.919
A coffee, thanks.

14:45.640 --> 14:48.559
The money gets moved
one minute after closing time.

14:50.320 --> 14:51.999
I'll pay for the gentleman.

15:02.080 --> 15:04.519
This place is abandoned
because it's unsafe.

15:06.720 --> 15:09.519
- We go in from here.
- What if it falls on us?

15:11.160 --> 15:14.719
If it falls after we've gone in,
we won't give a shit.

15:14.840 --> 15:17.319
- We come out somewhere else.
- Why?

15:19.080 --> 15:23.799
If you wanna survive, you gotta stay
one step ahead of the guy chasing you.

15:23.920 --> 15:25.999
We don't just want to survive.

15:30.080 --> 15:31.519
We'll deal with that.

15:37.600 --> 15:38.879
We come out here.

15:40.000 --> 15:42.039
On the square, behind the market.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.319
Then we'll need some guns,

15:45.440 --> 15:47.719
but you gotta take care of that, guys.

16:08.320 --> 16:09.519
Hey.

19:23.120 --> 19:24.359
Guys, here!

20:06.120 --> 20:07.399
Well?

20:09.920 --> 20:11.879
I think the guys are ready.

20:13.840 --> 20:15.359
So soon?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.639
They're like we were, you and me,

20:20.760 --> 20:22.519
they're hungry.

20:27.240 --> 20:29.159
That's what we need.

21:52.840 --> 21:54.239
Go on, open it.

22:08.360 --> 22:09.759
What's happening?

22:20.320 --> 22:21.959
Face down!

22:22.080 --> 22:23.439
Go, go!

22:25.440 --> 22:27.199
C'mon!

22:27.320 --> 22:28.759
Quick!

22:30.480 --> 22:31.919
Take this!

22:33.040 --> 22:34.639
Hurry up!

22:36.520 --> 22:39.519
- C'mon!
- Hurry up! Open here!

22:42.080 --> 22:45.279
- Get him off my arse, hurry up.
- Come with me.

22:45.720 --> 22:47.959
Everybody on the floor.

22:49.320 --> 22:52.999
- Less than a minute forty to go! Quick!
- Hurry up!

22:53.120 --> 22:55.919
- We haven't got all day!
- Gimme a minute!

22:56.040 --> 22:57.599
We gotta go!

22:57.720 --> 22:59.039
Go!

22:59.160 --> 23:01.759
We're done, put it in here!

23:02.760 --> 23:04.279
Go!

23:05.360 --> 23:06.559
Go!

23:09.320 --> 23:10.639
Quick!

24:06.440 --> 24:07.759
Maria...

24:44.840 --> 24:46.319
Let me know how it is.

25:15.720 --> 25:19.359
I swear on my mother's head,
he was shitting his pants.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.239
That's a lot of money!

25:23.360 --> 25:24.799
Look!

25:26.640 --> 25:27.759
Guys!

25:28.720 --> 25:30.439
We did it.

25:46.400 --> 25:47.759
Quiet!

25:54.320 --> 25:56.319
Pleased with yourselves, huh?

25:58.440 --> 26:00.919
So, what you wanna do with this money?

26:02.560 --> 26:05.879
Split it up and spend it?

26:06.880 --> 26:09.239
And then start over like before?

26:09.360 --> 26:11.599
That's what robbers do.

26:13.360 --> 26:15.359
Not people who want to grow.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.239
People who want to grow
need to invest their money

26:22.960 --> 26:24.999
to become stronger.

26:29.200 --> 26:30.799
What do you wanna be?

26:37.360 --> 26:39.119
You gotta decide.

26:55.800 --> 26:57.039
Bro!

28:27.200 --> 28:28.959
Now we can start.

29:00.320 --> 29:01.599
Maria...

29:04.200 --> 29:07.679
I'm sick of waitressing, it's not for me.

29:09.160 --> 29:11.879
Hold on a while longer, do it for her.

29:13.960 --> 29:16.159
Does she know what you're doing?

29:16.280 --> 29:19.239
I'm doing what's best for all of us.

29:19.360 --> 29:22.679
I know that, but your sister doesn't.

29:22.800 --> 29:25.319
And she's not stupid.

29:25.440 --> 29:27.159
You gotta tell her.

29:50.720 --> 29:52.199
Where'd you get that?

29:53.400 --> 29:56.999
Don't tell me it's from the stuff
you sell on our street,

29:57.120 --> 29:58.519
it's too much.

29:58.640 --> 30:00.399
I pulled a heist.

30:01.840 --> 30:04.879
- Where?
- Don't worry, no one noticed.

30:05.000 --> 30:07.799
So you can pay the City
to do the veranda.

30:12.360 --> 30:14.079
But now you gotta calm down.

30:14.200 --> 30:18.039
I'm already taking packages to my
husband, all I need is you in jail too.

30:21.040 --> 30:23.999
Carmela, I'll take the kid home.

30:25.560 --> 30:27.039
Enzo...

30:28.320 --> 30:30.279
You and Cosimo are my life.

31:40.680 --> 31:42.039
Genny?

31:44.320 --> 31:45.719
Have a seat.

31:50.720 --> 31:52.399
Thanks for meeting me.

31:54.760 --> 31:58.799
We've got good memories of your father,
we did good business with him.

32:00.680 --> 32:02.479
And you'll do it with me too.

32:06.160 --> 32:08.079
Good.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.279
It's 366,000 euros, to start.

32:23.520 --> 32:25.559
Then we can do it for 33 a kilo.

32:26.160 --> 32:28.399
Friends' discount.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.879
All right.

32:31.280 --> 32:32.839
When's the delivery?

32:36.680 --> 32:37.799
Tomorrow.

33:52.840 --> 33:53.999
Good.

34:05.280 --> 34:08.079
This shit's good
even if we cut it four times.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.998
We'll cut it by half.

34:12.120 --> 34:14.639
Our stuff's gotta be second to none.

34:14.760 --> 34:18.918
They need to see straight off it's not
the usual shit, they gotta come to us.

34:19.040 --> 34:22.159
- What are we selling it for?
- Less than them.

34:23.239 --> 34:25.679
Sorry, but that way we'll earn fuck all.

34:25.800 --> 34:28.438
For now that's how it's gotta be.

34:28.560 --> 34:31.399
We gotta earn the most important thing.
The dealing spot.

34:33.000 --> 34:36.639
Once they've all fucked off,
we do what we want.

35:00.240 --> 35:01.959
Hey, dude.

35:03.240 --> 35:06.319
- You wanted to meet him?
- Sure.

35:06.440 --> 35:09.919
- Are you Valerio?
- Yes, can I get you a drink?

35:10.040 --> 35:12.839
We'll drink later,
can we talk for a moment?

35:12.960 --> 35:14.639
Sure.

35:14.760 --> 35:16.479
I'll be right there.

35:24.800 --> 35:27.399
Pure 'n' Simple said
you're always selling out of weed.

35:27.520 --> 35:29.119
There's a high demand.

35:30.320 --> 35:33.599
If I told you we can do more,
would you be up to it?

35:36.120 --> 35:38.559
We can give you coke too.

35:38.680 --> 35:40.199
How much?

35:40.320 --> 35:41.839
As much as you want.

35:43.280 --> 35:45.639
That is what I hoped you would say.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.959
Hear how he speaks good?

35:49.320 --> 35:52.639
Pure 'n' Simple, what do you say
we call him Vocabulary?

35:54.360 --> 35:56.439
Fits like a glove.

35:57.440 --> 35:59.399
Now you're one of us, Vocabulary.

36:18.560 --> 36:20.399
Ciao, tutto a posto?

37:41.400 --> 37:42.999
Bro...

37:43.120 --> 37:45.999
It went like you said,
we didn't touch the streets.

37:46.120 --> 37:50.119
We'll screw 'em in the arse and they
won't even know where it came from.

37:51.200 --> 37:54.199
If they don't know today,
they'll know tomorrow.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.679
We gotta be ready.

37:56.800 --> 37:58.759
But do you know who they are?

38:03.600 --> 38:05.759
Do you know who you are?

38:05.880 --> 38:07.799
Or have you forgotten?

38:15.520 --> 38:17.439
This city is full of Ciros.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.559
But you're not just any Ciro,

38:32.680 --> 38:34.360
you're the Immortal
from Secondigliano, eh?

38:38.200 --> 38:39.919
The Immortal is dead.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.999
But that was what you went by, right?

38:45.360 --> 38:47.319
Is it so important?

38:51.160 --> 38:53.119
Blue Blood...

38:53.240 --> 38:55.719
that's me and that's it.

38:57.560 --> 38:59.199
If I have to fight for you,

38:59.320 --> 39:02.039
I need to know who you are
and who you were.

39:15.240 --> 39:17.199
That was what they called me.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.519
Enemy of the Republic...

39:47.640 --> 39:50.879
who has to disband the army...

39:52.680 --> 39:54.199
Look at me.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.079
Withdraw the...?

39:58.400 --> 39:59.599
Weapons.

39:59.720 --> 40:01.799
If you fail,
there's going to be hell to pay.

40:03.720 --> 40:05.999
- What are you doing?
- Nothing, why?

40:08.000 --> 40:11.639
They tolerate you only if you deal
a bit of dope in this street...

40:11.760 --> 40:14.599
Your attitude seems to be changing.

40:14.720 --> 40:16.599
That's not good.

40:16.720 --> 40:19.159
Keeping my head down's
giving me a pain in the neck.

40:19.280 --> 40:23.639
Me and you are breathing only because
Mum asked Don Arenella for a pardon.

40:25.000 --> 40:28.079
- Don't ever forget it.
- Mum wasn't right in the head.

40:28.200 --> 40:30.759
I was 14 when I buried Mum.

40:32.240 --> 40:35.519
I gave my word to Don Arenella
that it ended there,

40:35.640 --> 40:37.519
now I have to keep it,

40:37.640 --> 40:40.479
because a man's only got his word.

40:40.600 --> 40:41.919
You're not a man.

40:43.520 --> 40:45.839
But that's what I was, the man.

40:47.600 --> 40:49.559
A man and a mother.

40:49.680 --> 40:54.519
First for you and now for Cosimo,
because your head's full of air.

40:54.640 --> 40:57.279
I didn't make that deal,
but now I'm stuck to it,

40:57.400 --> 41:00.119
it was your word, and you gave it
for a bullshit reason.

41:00.240 --> 41:02.039
It's what Mum wanted

41:02.880 --> 41:05.439
and it meant we lived.

41:05.560 --> 41:09.239
What do you care? You don't respect
anyone or anything anymore.

41:09.360 --> 41:13.479
They killed your father and
they didn't even leave you a body to bury.

41:23.360 --> 41:26.599
We're children of ghosts

41:26.720 --> 41:29.639
and ghosts don't find peace.

41:29.760 --> 41:31.879
But war's worse...

41:33.280 --> 41:35.799
you know where it starts
but not where it ends.

42:36.800 --> 42:38.919
COMING UP
