- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

19:22.965 --> 19:25.758
I mean, what is wrong with you?

19:25.827 --> 19:29.448
That is nothing like
the bracelet you made me!

19:29.517 --> 19:31.413
- What are you talking about?

19:31.482 --> 19:33.517
And stop using the memory arm
for emphasis.

19:33.586 --> 19:35.551
It is for
nostalgia purposes only.

19:36.793 --> 19:38.241
- This is a fake.

19:38.310 --> 19:41.206
I've been freaking out about a
replacement bracelet all day,

19:41.275 --> 19:42.896
and you don't even remember
what it looks like.

19:42.965 --> 19:45.275
- Why would you need
a replacement bracelet?

19:46.137 --> 19:47.620
- I'd prefer not to say.

19:49.103 --> 19:50.758
- You have been acting weird
all day.

19:50.827 --> 19:52.206
What is going on?

19:53.620 --> 19:55.448
- Remember ten years ago,
when my family spent a week

19:55.517 --> 19:57.482
at arts and crafts camp?

19:57.551 --> 19:59.413
Well, I knew I was
going to miss you,

19:59.482 --> 20:01.413
so I lied about putting
the friendship bracelet

20:01.482 --> 20:02.931
in the lunch box,
and I wore it to camp.

20:03.000 --> 20:06.517
- Hey, that is a violation
of our lunchbox agreement.

20:06.586 --> 20:08.724
- I accidentally baked
your bracelet into a mug.

20:08.793 --> 20:10.517
I had my dad make
a replacement bracelet

20:10.586 --> 20:12.379
that was supposed to be
identical.

20:12.448 --> 20:14.827
- Wow, so you distracted me
all day

20:14.896 --> 20:17.310
with what I'm now realizing
were really bad lies

20:17.379 --> 20:19.275
while you had
a fake bracelet made

20:19.344 --> 20:21.551
just so my feelings
wouldn't be hurt?

20:21.620 --> 20:22.965
- Yeah.

20:23.034 --> 20:25.034
I'm sorry.

20:25.103 --> 20:27.241
Feel free to hit me
with the arm.

20:35.000 --> 20:36.551
Are you patting me
on the head?

20:36.620 --> 20:39.758
- Yes. Because you've had
a very hard day.

20:41.379 --> 20:44.034
These bracelets
aren't what's important to me.

20:44.103 --> 20:45.379
It's the memories.

20:45.448 --> 20:47.068
And that bracelet,
built on your lies,

20:47.137 --> 20:49.000
is now a new special memory.

20:49.068 --> 20:50.241
So it's going on the arm.

20:53.379 --> 20:55.241
- Lex! Lex, I did it!

20:55.310 --> 20:57.000
Get ready to love me.

20:57.068 --> 20:58.965
- You won little Reggie?

20:59.034 --> 21:00.965
- Not exactly. He got so upset
he couldn't win,

21:01.034 --> 21:02.344
he grabbed a chair,
threw it through the machine,

21:02.413 --> 21:04.620
grabbed the dog, and ran.

21:04.689 --> 21:07.172
- Wasn't Spenders upset
you smashed his claw machine?

21:07.241 --> 21:09.793
- Nope. Fisher dropped $200
in quarters on the machine,

21:09.862 --> 21:12.862
which more than paid
for the damage.

21:12.931 --> 21:14.241
- For you.

21:17.931 --> 21:19.310
It got caught
on the broken glass

21:19.379 --> 21:20.965
when I snatched it
out of the machine.

21:22.137 --> 21:23.965
- Thank you, Fisher.
I know exactly

21:24.034 --> 21:26.758
what I'm going to do with it.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.655
Our friendship is like
the two pieces of this dog.

21:29.724 --> 21:31.379
When we're separated,
it's sad

21:31.448 --> 21:34.103
and a little bit disturbing.

21:34.172 --> 21:35.793
But when we're together,

21:35.862 --> 21:38.965
It's happy and whole,
just like this doggie.

21:39.896 --> 21:41.620
Woof, woof.

21:41.689 --> 21:43.620
Woof, woof, woof, woof.

21:43.689 --> 21:46.931
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof--
- Okay.

21:47.000 --> 21:48.275
Let's put it in the lunch box

21:48.344 --> 21:49.931
and find it again
in ten years.

21:50.000 --> 21:52.758
- Great idea, because we'll
still be best friends.

21:53.689 --> 21:56.517
- Hey, Presley, I finally
cleaned up all the beads!

22:03.586 --> 22:06.310
Could someone please
get me a lemonade?
