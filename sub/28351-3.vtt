00:01.233 --> 00:01.433
.

00:10.800 --> 00:12.367
'The Geordies are back!'

00:12.433 --> 00:13.967
Hello!

00:14.033 --> 00:15.633
'Doing the things we love.'

00:16.467 --> 00:18.267
'But this time...'

00:18.333 --> 00:20.867
'...man's gonna mix things
right up.'

00:24.967 --> 00:26.067
(knocking)
(gasps)

00:26.133 --> 00:27.500
'With four newbies!'

00:27.567 --> 00:29.200
Oh, my God!

00:29.267 --> 00:30.833
It's gonna be fuckin' mint.

00:32.500 --> 00:35.600
'Anna's given the Geordie squad
a naughty facelift.'

00:35.667 --> 00:37.400
'I love a bit of change, me.'

00:38.633 --> 00:40.767
'But some things never change.'

00:43.367 --> 00:45.667
'I love this family.'

00:46.933 --> 00:49.467
(bell rings)
'Ding-fucking-ding, you dicks.'

00:49.533 --> 00:50.800
(cheering)

00:50.867 --> 00:52.867
Take it all in, bitch.

00:53.767 --> 00:57.233
'I know I'm packing a
double-decker,
but this is ridiculous!'

00:57.300 --> 00:59.267
This is your home away from
home.

00:59.333 --> 01:02.467
'Maybes being single
isn't as bad as I thought.'

01:02.533 --> 01:04.533
'Sam would never do that.'

01:07.733 --> 01:11.167
'Gonna give her that much
attention,
she won't know what to do.'

01:11.233 --> 01:14.233
All that matters is just me and
you.
Why am I here?

01:14.300 --> 01:17.033
Having Jay here made us realise
how much I miss him.

01:18.067 --> 01:20.867
I fancy the lad.
Tahlia and Beau, neck on.

01:20.933 --> 01:23.367
What the fuck?
Girls always blame the girl.

01:23.433 --> 01:25.333
(cheering)
He is a bit of me.

01:26.633 --> 01:29.700
'What've I done, man?'
'It's all kicking off.'

01:29.767 --> 01:32.367
We've been friends since day
one!
Fuck off, man.

01:33.667 --> 01:35.367
(squeaking)

01:36.400 --> 01:37.533
Fucking brilliant.

01:38.633 --> 01:40.533
I'm preened to perfection.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.733
I'm totally crackers, me, like.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.700
I'm a lad who's got more cheek
than a girl with fillers.

01:45.767 --> 01:47.833
Sometimes bubbly, sometimes
bitchy.

01:47.900 --> 01:49.333
I'm all over the place.

01:49.400 --> 01:52.133
I'm that good-looking,
I'd even neck on myself.

01:52.200 --> 01:54.933
I can talk the back legs
off a donkey.

01:55.000 --> 01:57.800
I might dance like a granddad,
but I'm proper radge.

01:57.867 --> 02:00.500
I'm fit, I'm flirty,
and I've got double-Fs.

02:00.567 --> 02:04.000
I might look rough and ready,
but I'm a massive softie.

02:04.067 --> 02:07.333
I cannae believe anyone
would put me in charge of this
lot.

02:07.400 --> 02:09.600
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

02:24.533 --> 02:27.067
(groans) Oh, God...

02:27.133 --> 02:29.767
Come on, girls. Get up, now.

02:29.833 --> 02:31.967
I am awake. Good morning.

02:32.033 --> 02:34.667
Did anyone notice Sam last
night?
Did you have sex?

02:34.733 --> 02:38.200
I'm up at dawn's crack this
morning,
ready to take on the world,

02:38.267 --> 02:40.533
cos last night,
me and Sam finally had sex.

02:40.600 --> 02:44.067
How long did it last? Quite a
while?
No, about five minutes.

02:44.133 --> 02:46.300
'Although,
we can't even do that right.'

02:46.367 --> 02:49.867
It was so nice to see Abbie.
Youse got to meet her,

02:49.933 --> 02:53.200
did you get to speak to her?
Yeah, she was proper nice.

02:53.267 --> 02:56.200
Last night was so good
to see my girl, Abbie.

02:56.267 --> 02:57.800
Until it went tits up.

02:57.867 --> 03:00.933
I swilled Beau last night,
I was livid.

03:01.000 --> 03:04.000
I was fuming, man.
Honestly, I was raging.

03:04.067 --> 03:06.900
I think it's cos he's saying
one thing to me, mate...

03:06.967 --> 03:09.000
...and then going and doing
another.

03:09.067 --> 03:11.900
And I'm sorry,
but I don't like that kind of
shit.

03:11.967 --> 03:15.400
'Beau said that he likes us,
but then he necked on with
Abbie.'

03:15.467 --> 03:18.533
'I fancy Beau, but I need to
walk away before I get hurt.'

03:18.600 --> 03:20.900
I feel like he'll wake up like,
"Oh, shit."

03:21.000 --> 03:22.267
Oh, 100%.

03:22.333 --> 03:25.300
Aye, I know. I hope he has
the worst fuckin' beer fear

03:25.367 --> 03:26.967
that he's ever had in his life.

03:32.033 --> 03:34.167
Beau, how do you feel today,
brother?

03:34.233 --> 03:36.433
I feel rough as tits
about the night.

03:36.500 --> 03:38.567
I feel like a little bit of
a bellend.

03:38.633 --> 03:40.700
'I'm one of the lads
and I love banter.'

03:40.767 --> 03:42.567
But I do things without
thinking.

03:42.633 --> 03:45.533
'Yes, it is daft,
but I just had a bit of a
shocker.'

03:45.600 --> 03:49.033
Can I just say, I did not force
youse to neck on with each
other.

03:49.100 --> 03:50.133
I know.

03:50.200 --> 03:53.767
'I mean, I kind of did, but
everyone
seems to have forgotten.'

03:53.833 --> 03:55.567
You did what you wanted.

03:55.633 --> 03:57.933
I don't agree with
when Chloe swilled you.

03:58.000 --> 04:01.367
Not at all. I was just scared
in case my fake tan ran.
(laughs)

04:01.433 --> 04:04.233
'Usually, I'd have Chloe's back
whatever the case,

04:04.300 --> 04:06.167
but she was wrong to swill Beau,

04:06.233 --> 04:09.200
and she was definitely wrong
for having a go at Nathan.'

04:09.267 --> 04:12.900
All jokes aside,
do you regret kissing Abbie?

04:12.967 --> 04:14.633
I don't regret kissing Abbie.

04:14.700 --> 04:18.433
What I do regret is saying
what I'm saying to the girls,

04:18.500 --> 04:21.899
and then doing what I want to
do...
That's the part you went wrong.

04:21.966 --> 04:26.100
'I'm so glad I've come into this
house already in a
relationship.'

04:26.167 --> 04:29.933
It stopped me from getting in
the
trouble Beau has found himself
in.

04:30.000 --> 04:33.500
Tell you what, get the brews on,
lad.
Sound, happy days.

04:33.567 --> 04:36.433
(groans) Oh, God, my body is
fucked.

04:44.267 --> 04:46.033
Morning.
(Chloe) Morning.

04:47.267 --> 04:48.900
(clears throat)
(laughs)

04:48.967 --> 04:51.800
So, obviously, I want to
apologise
for swilling you.

04:51.867 --> 04:54.533
No, I understand why.
Do you?

04:54.600 --> 04:58.700
'Beau actually looks guilty.
At least he knows he messed up.'

04:58.767 --> 05:02.167
I'm just a little bit annoyed,
you've gotta understand.

05:02.233 --> 05:05.833
That's my best friend, you can't
be
saying "I like Bethan,"

05:05.900 --> 05:08.333
and then do the opposite.
I know.

05:08.400 --> 05:11.600
The reason I get so angry
is cos I've been in that
position.

05:11.667 --> 05:14.367
It's not nice at all.
I know. I can imagine.

05:14.433 --> 05:18.300
'Chloe's made me think my snog
with
Abbie, which meant nothing to
me,

05:18.367 --> 05:20.233
has really confused Bethan.'

05:20.300 --> 05:23.267
'I'm definitely not going
out of my way to hurt Bethan.'

05:23.333 --> 05:25.867
I know I am in the wrong,
I will make it up to her.

05:25.933 --> 05:28.733
Just try and stick to what you
say.

05:28.800 --> 05:31.900
The way Beau has handled this,
I'm impressed.

05:31.967 --> 05:34.267
'Maybe he's not a fuckboy after
all!'

05:34.333 --> 05:37.767
If you need anything, come to
me,
I'm the best for advice.

05:37.833 --> 05:39.700
Sound, I appreciate that.

05:46.267 --> 05:47.633
Yo.
Oi-oi, mate.

05:47.700 --> 05:49.833
'Beau could do with
clearing his head,

05:49.900 --> 05:52.233
so I'm going to take him
for some fresh air.'

05:52.300 --> 05:55.700
'It'll also be a good chance to
catch up with one of my best
mates.'

06:00.500 --> 06:01.600
Come on, then.

06:08.567 --> 06:10.900
Ew... is that your milk?
Where?

06:10.967 --> 06:13.900
Or is that one of the girls'?
I would never drink milk.

06:13.967 --> 06:16.367
I know who that is.
Wouldn't dare. Who is it?

06:16.433 --> 06:19.433
Chloe fucking Ferry.
My butthole's wet again.

06:21.300 --> 06:24.667
I feel bad cos, Chloe, you had
a bit of an argument with
Nathan.

06:24.733 --> 06:28.200
You know, we're all right, I
just
got a bit mad cos me and Nathan

06:28.267 --> 06:30.033
come in the house together.

06:30.100 --> 06:34.067
How are you sticking up for
Beau,
who's treated these girls like
shit?

06:34.133 --> 06:36.000
'I was only sticking up for
Bethan,

06:36.067 --> 06:38.133
and the fact that Nathan
can't see that

06:38.200 --> 06:40.800
makes us think
we aren't the friends I
thought.'

06:43.433 --> 06:45.567
Why don't we have pre drinks
at my house?

06:45.633 --> 06:48.700
Fuckin' girls' night.
(both gasp) Yes!

06:49.567 --> 06:52.300
And then we go out
and meet the lads in the club!

06:54.033 --> 06:57.033
(all) Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, Ivy, Ivy!

06:57.100 --> 07:00.300
'What a cracking idea. I hope
Chloe's mam's gonna be there,

07:00.367 --> 07:03.600
cos she is a right laugh,
and Tahlia will love her.'

07:03.667 --> 07:06.733
With it being a girls' night,
we should invite Natalie.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.433
Us girls, and Natalie.

07:08.500 --> 07:12.033
'It's really unlike Chloe not
to invite Nathan for pre
drinks.'

07:12.100 --> 07:14.867
'Usually, when they argue,
they sort it out.'

07:14.933 --> 07:17.600
I just hope that Nathan
doesn't take it too badly.

07:17.667 --> 07:21.800
Tonight, we're gonna
go to Chloe's for pre drinks,

07:21.867 --> 07:25.367
just the girls, and you've got
a vagina, so you're gonna come.

07:25.433 --> 07:27.600
(cheers) Yeah, buddy!

07:27.667 --> 07:28.833
'What?'

07:28.900 --> 07:30.867
Chloe's not inviting me to
drinks?

07:30.933 --> 07:35.433
I know we had an argument, but
surely
she's not still pissed off?

07:35.500 --> 07:36.967
Girls' night!

07:37.033 --> 07:40.267
# SURVIVOR: Eye of the Tiger

07:48.800 --> 07:50.367
(laughs)

07:50.433 --> 07:53.033
'I'm buzzing to have
this time out with Sam,

07:53.100 --> 07:56.333
and we're meeting one of his
mates.
I hope he's sound as Sam.'

07:56.400 --> 07:57.967
One, two, left hook...

07:58.033 --> 08:00.533
What are youse doing?
About time, mate!

08:00.600 --> 08:02.533
How are youse?
Nice to meet you.

08:02.600 --> 08:05.367
God, you're a big fucker,
aren't you?

08:05.433 --> 08:09.233
Way-hey!
Get them fucking ropes, mate.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.633
It's so nice to see Adam,

08:10.700 --> 08:13.833
and it looks like he's been so
busy
since leaving the house.

08:13.900 --> 08:16.467
'Working for Willy Wonka,
judging by his tan!'

08:16.533 --> 08:19.167
You all right?
I'm good. Enjoying it?

08:19.233 --> 08:21.333
Beau's having a nightmare.
What?

08:21.400 --> 08:25.533
Bethan, Chloe's best mate, came
in
the house. They've been cracking
on.

08:25.600 --> 08:28.100
Beau admitted to Chlo
that he did like Bethan,

08:28.167 --> 08:29.933
and he's gonna see where it
goes,

08:30.000 --> 08:32.732
but on the same night
he kissed Tahlia at work...

08:32.799 --> 08:35.232
Then, on the same night,
when Abbie came,

08:35.299 --> 08:38.100
necking on with Abbie
in front of Bethan and Tahlia.

08:38.167 --> 08:40.900
Take it from me, necking on
with more than one bird

08:40.967 --> 08:43.866
is a recipe for disaster.
Especially if one's Abbie.

08:43.933 --> 08:47.100
I'm in a tricky situation.
I don't want a relationship,

08:47.167 --> 08:51.033
cos it's hard work, but at
the same time, I've got
feelings.

08:51.100 --> 08:53.733
You can't fight your feelings.
You cannot.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.767
The more I fight, the worse it
gets.

08:55.833 --> 08:57.967
Fucking howay, then.
Know what I mean?

08:58.033 --> 09:01.967
'Beau looks like a lad, but it
seems
like he's caught some feelings.'

09:02.900 --> 09:05.600
Right, that'll do.
Pack up, it's freezing.

09:05.667 --> 09:07.467
Fucked me.
Fucked? You were late!

09:07.533 --> 09:09.267
You need to finish what we done.

09:09.333 --> 09:11.400
What did youse do?
Hundred press-ups.

09:11.467 --> 09:12.833
Just do 50...
Aye, sound.

09:12.900 --> 09:16.033
Do inclined, we'll pack the
stuff up,
then leave together.

09:16.100 --> 09:17.300
All right.

09:18.133 --> 09:19.933
Keep going mate, good start.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.500
(indistinct)

09:25.533 --> 09:28.967
'Falling for that has made Adam
look even more ridiculous

09:29.033 --> 09:31.700
than his barber
could ever dream of doing.'

09:45.233 --> 09:46.433
Well...
Now, then.

09:46.500 --> 09:48.233
Oi-oi.
Where's everyone?

09:48.300 --> 09:49.833
How's it going?
All right?

09:49.900 --> 09:52.800
Girls are getting ready,
they're going to your house.

09:52.867 --> 09:55.033
My house?
For pre-drinks.

09:55.100 --> 09:57.867
'I was hoping to apologise.
That'll have to wait.'

09:57.933 --> 09:59.933
Are you going with the girls?
Aye.

10:00.000 --> 10:02.700
Is it just us three?
We're gonna have drinks here.

10:02.767 --> 10:03.800
That's sound.

10:08.633 --> 10:12.367
I've never been so excited
for girls' night in my life!

10:12.433 --> 10:14.000
I've got my horns on!

10:14.067 --> 10:17.367
Come on, Natalie,
what better night would you
have,

10:17.433 --> 10:20.000
with loads of girls or boys?
Come on.

10:20.067 --> 10:23.500
Before I had a bird,
I'd honestly say girls' night.

10:23.567 --> 10:26.900
Yeah, exactly.
Youse get your tits and fannies
out,

10:26.967 --> 10:30.100
so I'd enjoy that usually,
but now I've got a girlfriend,

10:30.167 --> 10:33.433
I have to say boys' night.
Seeing a cock doesn't bother us.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.533
'I don't know what kind of
girls' nights you've been on.'

10:36.600 --> 10:39.133
The only thing we're getting out
are the drinks.

10:39.200 --> 10:42.967
Lasses, I'm gonna grab my kit.
Don't take forever, will you?

10:43.033 --> 10:46.333
Never say that to a woman when
she's contouring her nose.
Never!

10:57.733 --> 10:59.533
Right, come on, girls, let's go.

10:59.600 --> 11:03.233
'I'm not gonna lie, a girly
girls'
night is out of my comfort zone,

11:03.300 --> 11:06.133
but I like the girls in the
house,
so it should be fun.'

11:06.200 --> 11:07.400
Bye, girls.

11:08.533 --> 11:10.767
Oh, sorry. (laughs) Bye, bitch.

11:10.833 --> 11:12.133
Thanks for the invite.

11:12.200 --> 11:14.833
In the past,
Chloe would have put beef behind
her

11:14.900 --> 11:16.833
and invited us to the girls'
night.

11:16.900 --> 11:19.367
'If I'm honest,
it's making me a bit sad.'

11:19.433 --> 11:20.867
Bye!

11:24.567 --> 11:26.867
'There's Ivy. I'm so excited.'

11:28.300 --> 11:30.700
'Bethan is making me work
for this apology.'

11:30.767 --> 11:32.767
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

11:35.967 --> 11:36.167
.

11:38.700 --> 11:38.900
.

11:46.767 --> 11:49.500
Youse actually go in the shower,
this is what I do.

11:49.567 --> 11:51.567
(laughs) That's disgusting.

11:51.633 --> 11:53.567
That how you're getting
showered?

11:53.633 --> 11:55.667
'A quick spray
of your cock and balls,

11:55.733 --> 11:58.100
also known as a Geordie shower.'

11:58.167 --> 12:00.433
You and Chloe obviously
have got a bit...

12:00.500 --> 12:03.433
It wasn't nice, getting left.
Yeah. I am sorry, mate.

12:03.500 --> 12:06.900
'The more I think about it,
why wasn't I invited to
Chloe's?'

12:06.967 --> 12:11.067
Obviously I'm gonna speak to
Chloe.
I don't want to argue with her.

12:11.133 --> 12:14.300
Youse argue over
the stupidest things, though.

12:14.367 --> 12:16.300
You've never argued for a
reason.

12:16.367 --> 12:18.833
You argue over
somebody else's argument.

12:18.900 --> 12:21.833
You've hit the nail on the head,
we do. That is the truth.

12:21.900 --> 12:24.200
'I can understand
why Nathan's annoyed.'

12:24.267 --> 12:27.400
'He's done nothing wrong.
Chloe's being a bit harsh.'

12:27.467 --> 12:31.200
How would you feel if we went to
the club, and Bethan was with a
lad?

12:31.267 --> 12:34.267
I don't know. I haven't been
in that situation before.

12:34.333 --> 12:37.700
It's probably gonna happen.
If you're gonna say one thing,

12:37.767 --> 12:40.333
and then do another,
you are on your own.

12:40.400 --> 12:43.100
So, the onus... is on you.

12:43.167 --> 12:44.533
The what?
Onus.

12:44.600 --> 12:46.533
I've heard of anus, not onus.

12:46.600 --> 12:48.667
What the fuck's an onus?
Like, the...

12:48.733 --> 12:51.900
Are you making up words?
The main point. The onus is on
you.

12:51.967 --> 12:54.833
Someone's swallowed a dictionary
today. (laughs)

13:04.000 --> 13:06.867
Right, youse, come on.
Come on, then.

13:10.100 --> 13:13.433
Cheers to Beau not kissing any
girls
or causing any arguments.

13:13.500 --> 13:14.733
Cheers to that.

13:14.800 --> 13:16.733
Shall we go, then?
Howay, then.

13:16.800 --> 13:18.433
Weird without the girls.

13:18.500 --> 13:21.367
'I can't wait to get to the
club,
cos I want to see Bethan

13:21.433 --> 13:23.433
and clear the air.'
(flatulence)

13:29.567 --> 13:31.600
(doorbell rings)

13:31.667 --> 13:34.233
(cheering)

13:35.133 --> 13:38.267
'We get to the house,
and there's Ivy. I'm so
excited.'

13:38.333 --> 13:40.067
I'm excited to see my mam, too.

13:40.133 --> 13:41.667
(chatter)

13:41.733 --> 13:44.733
To party.
I wish you'd give us some
notice!

13:44.800 --> 13:47.600
'I cannot believe
all these lasses have turned up,

13:47.667 --> 13:51.267
and I'm in the middle
of watching Coronation Street.'

13:51.333 --> 13:54.700
We'll sit down and relax
while you get us a feast.

13:54.767 --> 13:56.267
Right...
Ivy!

13:56.333 --> 13:58.800
This house is naughty!
It feels mad to be out.

13:58.867 --> 14:00.900
'Buzzing to be invited to
Chloe's.'

14:00.967 --> 14:03.700
'It's so nice to meet her mam
and her dog, Ivy.'

14:09.467 --> 14:13.867
Don't worry. The proper Geordie
mam
can get a feast made up in
seconds.

14:17.267 --> 14:19.200
Is that beans?
Is that jelly beans?

14:19.267 --> 14:20.900
'I am made up to see Liz.'

14:20.967 --> 14:24.633
She's like a second mam to me,
and
she puts on a banging spread,
too.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.267
To company!
(laughs)

14:27.333 --> 14:29.500
Ooh, that's fucking lush, that.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.933
Where's the drinks?

14:31.000 --> 14:32.800
What's that?
Cocktail maker.

14:32.867 --> 14:36.233
(cheering)
Cocktail shaker!

14:36.300 --> 14:38.967
Can anyone make cocktails?
Me, I can.

14:39.033 --> 14:41.033
Cocktail making is my party
trick.

14:41.100 --> 14:43.933
I make the best cocktails,
I'll blow their heads off.

14:44.000 --> 14:47.667
Go on, Mam, you can put your
feet up.
Thank you for the cheese.

14:47.733 --> 14:51.067
Take Ivy with you,
cos she's greedin'.

14:51.133 --> 14:52.733
Right, come on.
Bye, girl!

14:52.800 --> 14:55.133
Now these girls
have been fed and watered,

14:55.200 --> 14:58.633
me and Ivy can get back
and watch Coronation Street.

14:58.700 --> 14:59.767
(chuckles)

15:04.567 --> 15:07.133
Faster! Faster!
(yells)

15:07.200 --> 15:09.233
Wank it off.
(cheering)

15:10.100 --> 15:12.333
Put a bean in it.
Shall we put a flamingo?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.133
'I love Sex on the Beach.'

15:14.200 --> 15:17.333
And that just happens
to be the name of the cocktail,
too.

15:17.400 --> 15:18.867
Here you go, drink up.

15:18.933 --> 15:20.567
To the girls!

15:20.633 --> 15:22.200
Oh, I lost my straw...

15:22.267 --> 15:25.500
Tahlia, d'you like the house,
then?
It's fucking amazing.

15:25.567 --> 15:27.500
It's nice.
I walked in and I felt like

15:27.567 --> 15:29.600
I was in one of
the Kardashian houses.

15:29.667 --> 15:31.767
Didn't think
I'd have a house like this!

15:31.833 --> 15:36.133
I'm having a canny time, but
I'm not used to necking
cocktails.

15:36.200 --> 15:38.200
At least they're not that
alcoholic.

15:38.267 --> 15:40.933
Chlo, you know you defended
Bethan
than night?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.233
I feel like you and Nathan
had this argument when we got
back.

15:44.300 --> 15:46.933
I think he was defending Beau...

15:47.000 --> 15:50.367
I feel like he would love
tonight,
I did, but, I dunno...

15:50.433 --> 15:53.467
If you'd invited him, it...
it would've been awkward.

15:53.533 --> 15:55.167
'I do wish Nathan was here,

15:55.233 --> 15:58.933
but he stuck up for someone he's
known for a few days over my
friend.'

16:00.867 --> 16:03.700
Obviously, I love Nathan,
I love him so much...

16:03.767 --> 16:06.867
I think you and Nathan
are always gonna have that bond

16:06.933 --> 16:08.533
that nobody else can get.

16:08.600 --> 16:10.367
But I think talk to him.
I will.

16:10.433 --> 16:13.333
'I feel really sad that Nathan
wasn't here tonight,

16:13.400 --> 16:16.433
and I really hope that him and
Chloe
can sort things out,

16:16.500 --> 16:18.433
because I don't wanna leave him
out.

16:18.500 --> 16:21.467
I think you're smitten with
Beau.
I think he likes you.

16:21.533 --> 16:23.633
Really?
I'm gonna put it out there.

16:23.700 --> 16:25.000
Don't get us excited.

16:25.067 --> 16:27.700
'It does make us happy
to hear Beau might like us.'

16:27.767 --> 16:30.800
'But I need to hear it from him
before I believe it.'

16:30.867 --> 16:32.833
(cheering)

16:32.900 --> 16:35.700
'It's been so lovely,
hanging out in Chloe's house.'

16:35.767 --> 16:38.833
'Me and the girls
are getting to know each other.'

16:38.900 --> 16:40.667
(all) Bye!

16:40.733 --> 16:45.233
Though we're heading to the
club,
I'm gonna miss my baby so much.

16:55.867 --> 16:59.900
'We've arrived at the club and
the girls are nowhere to be
seen.'

16:59.967 --> 17:02.100
'Let lads' night commence!'

17:02.167 --> 17:04.500
(cheering)

17:25.800 --> 17:28.633
'I don't know how Bethan's
gonna take my apology.'

17:28.700 --> 17:30.833
'But I am also excited to see
her.'

17:30.900 --> 17:32.367
(laughs)

17:36.133 --> 17:40.633
'I am raring for tonight. All
the
girls are absolutely plastered.'

17:40.700 --> 17:42.000
'It's gonna be lit.'

17:50.933 --> 17:54.900
'Chloe said she wanted more
attention, so I give her more.'

17:54.967 --> 17:56.567
And it seems to be working.

18:04.000 --> 18:07.267
I do really appreciate
Sam giving me more attention.

18:07.333 --> 18:09.433
I just wish I didn't have to
ask.

18:21.700 --> 18:23.367
Normally I'm not bothered.

18:23.433 --> 18:26.667
But something about Bethan
makes me wanna get this right.

18:34.600 --> 18:36.867
'Right, there's no time
like the present.'

18:36.933 --> 18:39.700
'I need to talk to her
and sort out our friendship.'

18:57.333 --> 19:01.233
I thought that Nathan was gonna
apologise to us for last night.

19:01.300 --> 19:04.300
'But instead, he's going in.
I don't want to fight.'

19:10.300 --> 19:12.767
Me and Chloe have been best
friends
for ages.

19:12.833 --> 19:16.267
And it's stupid we're arguing
over other people's arguments.

19:16.333 --> 19:19.333
We don't have anything bad to
say
about each other.

19:41.800 --> 19:45.600
There was a time when me and
Nathan
were best friends. Things
change.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.300
I've got a house, a dog
and a boyfriend.

19:48.367 --> 19:50.700
I don't understand
how I grew up so quickly.

20:13.533 --> 20:16.100
'I need to go talk to Bethan.
Wish me luck.'

20:18.533 --> 20:22.600
'I can see Beau approaching
Bethan.
I was impressed earlier,

20:22.667 --> 20:25.767
but I'm scared in case
he's gonna mug her off once
again.'

20:42.067 --> 20:45.900
'Bethan is looking so fit
tonight,
and she's making me work for
this.'

21:07.633 --> 21:10.333
'Oh, my God,
I've got butterflies in my
stomach.'

21:10.400 --> 21:13.233
'But I need to remember
that Beau's got a long way to go

21:13.300 --> 21:15.633
to prove to me
he's not gonna hurt us.'

21:22.600 --> 21:25.467
(cheering)

21:45.233 --> 21:48.000
I am honestly having
the best time tonight.

21:48.067 --> 21:50.400
'And I feel like me and Chloe
are bonding.'

22:11.900 --> 22:13.767
'Tonight has been great.'

22:13.833 --> 22:16.800
I've made up with Chloe,
and Beau made things right.

22:16.867 --> 22:20.000
'Now, let's end on a high
and get the fuck out of here.'

22:31.467 --> 22:34.300
'Thanks to Tahlia's
Sex on the Beach drinks,

22:34.367 --> 22:38.367
I've now got pizza on the
pavement.
I can hear my bed calling me!'

22:42.933 --> 22:45.533
Are you cracking on with my best
pal
or what?

22:45.600 --> 22:47.533
Listen, if you brush your
teeth...

22:47.600 --> 22:49.867
...we'll have a cuddle.
(cheering)

22:49.933 --> 22:52.900
Get in the toilet!
Beau, Beau, Beau, quick!

22:52.967 --> 22:55.733
It's so amazing,
first getting with someone.

22:55.800 --> 22:58.267
'So much excitement
and so much passion!'

22:58.333 --> 23:01.400
Brush your teeth. Brush your
teeth.
Run, run, run!

23:07.900 --> 23:10.633
Have you touched the cock, yet?
No, definitely not.

23:10.700 --> 23:14.500
It's not happening, so everyone
get that out their head.

23:14.567 --> 23:16.867
'Whatever me and Beau's got
is very new.'

23:16.933 --> 23:21.167
'I don't need commentary on
whether
I've touched the cock. I
haven't.'

23:28.600 --> 23:31.867
'I know I'm being dramatic,
but don't sleep in someone's bed

23:31.933 --> 23:36.400
when they've put fresh bedding
on
for themselves, not for you!'

23:38.433 --> 23:41.167
(laughs) You!

23:41.233 --> 23:43.367
'This morning,
I was in bed with Nathan.'

23:43.433 --> 23:46.700
'Now I'm in the shag pad with
Bethan. I did not see this
coming.'

23:49.967 --> 23:51.800
(laughter)

23:57.533 --> 23:59.433
Sex?
I got further than I thought.

23:59.500 --> 24:01.567
'Woof, woof, you divvies.'

24:01.633 --> 24:03.700
'Oops. I dropped my towel.'

24:03.767 --> 24:05.733
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

24:08.467 --> 24:08.667
.

24:11.200 --> 24:11.400
.

24:25.967 --> 24:28.100
(yawns)

24:30.167 --> 24:31.467
(groans)

24:33.367 --> 24:36.900
Morning.
I had the best night's sleep...

24:36.967 --> 24:38.967
Me and Chloe sorted our shit
out,

24:39.033 --> 24:42.800
Beau and Bethan had a neck on,
and I'm not even hungover!

24:42.867 --> 24:44.200
Hello.
Oh, here she is.

24:44.267 --> 24:45.667
Hello, doll.
How are you?

24:45.733 --> 24:47.900
I'm all right.

24:47.967 --> 24:51.400
Tell us all.
Nothing. Just had a little kiss.

24:51.467 --> 24:52.667
Shut up, man.

24:52.733 --> 24:56.000
Did you sexy grind on top?
I didn't do nothing like that.

24:56.067 --> 24:58.567
Oh, no, nothing like that,
Jesus.

24:58.633 --> 25:02.600
I admire Bethan's control. Me
and
Jay slept together the first
night,

25:02.667 --> 25:04.933
and if I was with him in this
house,

25:05.000 --> 25:07.567
we'd take over the shag pad
permanently.

25:07.633 --> 25:09.600
Did you touch the penis?

25:09.667 --> 25:11.200
I could feel it in my back.

25:11.267 --> 25:14.200
And I was like... (hums)
(laughs)

25:14.267 --> 25:18.433
But then I was like, "No, make
sure
you're doing the right thing

25:18.500 --> 25:21.100
with the right person..."
At the right time.

25:21.167 --> 25:22.900
I was just having a neck on.

25:22.967 --> 25:25.333
'With Bethan and Beau
getting together,

25:25.400 --> 25:27.300
this is the house of couples.'

25:27.367 --> 25:29.600
'Me and Nathan
are the only single ones.'

25:30.533 --> 25:33.967
We obviously seen you and Chloe
having a debate last night.

25:34.033 --> 25:37.167
We looked like we were arguing,
but we weren't.

25:37.233 --> 25:41.000
It was, like... At the end of
the day, we don't want to argue.

25:41.067 --> 25:43.133
Let's just hug and make up,
and we did.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.400
'I'm so glad that me and Chloe
managed to talk last night.'

25:46.467 --> 25:48.533
I've missed having her as my
friend,

25:48.600 --> 25:50.967
especially now
I'm learning to be single.

25:51.033 --> 25:54.400
How did you leave it? Good?
We literally cuddled.

25:54.467 --> 25:55.900
Good.

25:58.733 --> 26:01.033
(cheering)
Here he is, top shagger!

26:01.100 --> 26:02.733
Here he is, the dirty stop-out!

26:03.867 --> 26:05.033
(groans)

26:05.100 --> 26:07.067
Let's get to the nitty-gritty.

26:07.133 --> 26:09.000
Did you have sex?
No, no.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.967
I got further than I thought.

26:11.033 --> 26:13.300
At least she's shared a bed
with you.

26:13.367 --> 26:15.167
Exactly.
We're moving forward.

26:15.233 --> 26:18.433
'I'm glad I picked up the
courage
to tell Bethan I like her,

26:18.500 --> 26:20.533
and it looks like
she feels the same.'

26:20.600 --> 26:22.967
Go on, make the bacon butties.
Go on, baby.

26:23.033 --> 26:25.567
Go on, stop thinking,
go get some bacon.

26:25.633 --> 26:27.900
All right.
Do youse think I'm gonna move?

26:27.967 --> 26:29.167
Aye.
Yes.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.900
Well, I could get used to this.
(laughs) Don't.

26:36.967 --> 26:39.633
You gonna make me breakfast
every morning?

26:39.700 --> 26:42.133
Depends what you do for me
in the night-time.

26:42.200 --> 26:44.133
(laughs)

26:44.200 --> 26:45.700
What's going on there?!

26:45.767 --> 26:48.100
Just flirting.
Over a sausage.

26:48.167 --> 26:51.367
'Watching Beau make breakfast
with Bethan is so cute.'

26:51.433 --> 26:53.600
'I've been with Sam
for a year and a half

26:53.667 --> 26:55.467
and he hasn't grilled me a
sausage!

26:55.533 --> 26:57.533
Sam, pass us a sausage.
(phone rings)

26:57.600 --> 26:59.300
Phone!
Phone!

26:59.367 --> 27:01.400
(laughs) For God's sake,
Nathan...

27:01.467 --> 27:03.867
Trust you!
I haven't finished wiping my
bum!

27:03.933 --> 27:06.500
'I'm on the shitter,
and the phone's ringing.'

27:06.567 --> 27:08.733
I've got toilet roll
attached to my foot!

27:08.800 --> 27:09.900
Hello?

27:09.967 --> 27:11.900
"Hi, Nathan, it's Anna."
Hi, Anna.

27:11.967 --> 27:14.900
'It's Anna,
which means one thing. Work.'

27:15.000 --> 27:19.700
"If you tell Sam, Bethan, Nat
and
Beau they're gonna go flyering,

27:19.767 --> 27:21.400
so they need to dress up warm."

27:21.467 --> 27:24.967
"I expect a good job, so
I'm sending Scott to keep an
eye."

27:25.033 --> 27:26.733
Oh, God. OK.

27:26.800 --> 27:31.067
I can't wait to rub it in the
others'
face that I'm not going to work.

27:31.133 --> 27:35.167
That was Anna.
Sam, Bethan, Beau and Natalie,

27:35.233 --> 27:38.300
she said wrap up warm,
and youse are going to flyer.

27:38.367 --> 27:40.333
(laughs)

27:40.400 --> 27:44.633
What're we gonna do?
We got the day off!

27:44.700 --> 27:46.967
'I am so happy
that I'm not at work today.'

27:47.033 --> 27:50.200
'Flyering in this weather?
That would be shit.'

27:50.267 --> 27:52.067
Go on, piss off and get dressed.

28:03.400 --> 28:05.833
What is yoghurt?
Milk.

28:05.900 --> 28:10.267
You know what milk is? Cows'
pus.
Do you know you get steak off a
cow?

28:11.767 --> 28:13.100
Sam.
What?

28:13.167 --> 28:14.900
Come on.
You can't be that thick.

28:14.967 --> 28:16.233
He is thick.

28:16.300 --> 28:19.033
Sam is as daft as a brush.
Bless him, though.

28:19.100 --> 28:21.900
Come on, we're going to work.
Let's get this done.

28:22.000 --> 28:25.300
'This is my first day at work
and I'm looking forward to it.'

28:25.367 --> 28:27.833
See youse all later!
Bye!

28:40.433 --> 28:43.100
Surely, it's not just us?
I think it is, like.

28:43.167 --> 28:46.733
We've arrived in the Toon,
and there's nobody. What's going
on?

28:48.300 --> 28:49.600
(laughter)

28:49.667 --> 28:52.667
How're youse doing?
Mate, it was all right...

28:52.733 --> 28:53.967
Well, listen...

28:54.033 --> 28:56.533
'So, Anna's asked me
to meet the crew in town,

28:56.600 --> 29:00.333
cos they've got some work to do
to promote a dog-walking
business.'

29:00.400 --> 29:03.300
'I thought, I'm gonna have
a fuckin' frisk with this.'

29:03.367 --> 29:06.967
So, I've got some lovely
costumes
which I need youse to wear...

29:07.033 --> 29:09.267
Mate...
Poochie-poos!

29:09.333 --> 29:10.600
(laughter)
Mate...

29:10.667 --> 29:14.400
'Wait a minute. I'm being forced
to
spend the whole day dressed as a
dog

29:14.467 --> 29:17.033
in front of the lad I fancy?
This is so cringey.'

29:19.000 --> 29:21.500
'Woof, woof, you fuckin'
divvies.'

29:22.933 --> 29:26.800
'Scuse me, is your dog in need
of
a walk? No? Nay bother, mate.

29:28.200 --> 29:30.267
Fancy your dog walked by
radgies?

29:30.333 --> 29:33.967
Would you let me walk your dog?
Got a dog at home?

29:34.033 --> 29:36.833
Ooh!
(laughter)

29:36.900 --> 29:40.633
'Just when I thought I had
a customer, his dog attacks me!'

29:40.700 --> 29:42.700
(barks)
Business is closed!

29:43.867 --> 29:46.667
(laughs)

29:47.567 --> 29:51.167
'Even thought I'm wearing a dog
outfit, Beau's still flirting.'

29:55.300 --> 30:00.167
Will you take this just to make
it
look like I'm working? Thank
you.

30:00.233 --> 30:04.300
'Are they radge? All you need to
do
is go, "Want your dog walked?"'

30:04.367 --> 30:07.300
'"Yes? There you go."
Sorted. Job's a good 'un.'

30:07.367 --> 30:10.833
Oh, my God...
I'm really happy with my tail.

30:13.533 --> 30:15.133
Has he gone? Is he gone?

30:15.200 --> 30:17.033
Right, I've got an idea.

30:17.100 --> 30:19.100
Bin.
(Beau) Howay, then, fuck it.

30:21.467 --> 30:25.633
Tell you what, we have done well
to get rid of all of them.

30:25.700 --> 30:26.767
So well.

30:36.033 --> 30:38.100
(barks)

30:38.167 --> 30:39.600
(barks)

30:39.667 --> 30:42.000
(Sophie) Fuck off.
(Nathan) No.

30:42.067 --> 30:43.800
So...
(Chloe) What am I seeing?

30:43.867 --> 30:45.100
So embarrassed.

30:45.167 --> 30:48.233
The most embarrassed...
Are all of youse dressed?

30:48.300 --> 30:51.000
Not being funny, but, Sam,
why do you look the worst?

30:51.067 --> 30:54.033
'Sam, that outfit
is doing you no favours.'

30:54.100 --> 30:56.700
'It has definitely
not made my fanny flutter.'

30:56.767 --> 30:58.900
Why're you dressed
like you're in E17?

30:58.967 --> 31:03.067
Don't comment on the way I'm
dressed
when you're dressed like that.

31:03.133 --> 31:04.767
Fat dog, there.

31:05.800 --> 31:08.433
'I can't take them serious
in these outfits.'

31:08.500 --> 31:11.767
Get the fuck upstairs, get
changed,
cos I want to go out.

31:11.833 --> 31:14.233
Youse are all dressing nice
tonight!

31:19.200 --> 31:20.267
Wagwan, son?

31:20.333 --> 31:23.133
'Fuck me.
Beau has got tattoos
everywhere.'

31:28.733 --> 31:30.500
Oh, here she is...

31:30.567 --> 31:33.033
Oi, oi!
Stalker coming in!

31:33.100 --> 31:35.267
There is two boys in this world.

31:35.333 --> 31:37.667
'Beau, sexy and naked,

31:37.733 --> 31:40.300
and Sam, with no top lip,
brushing his teeth.'

31:40.367 --> 31:41.633
I know which I'd choose.

31:41.700 --> 31:43.867
Oh, for fuck's sake...

31:43.933 --> 31:45.900
'Oops. I dropped my towel.'

31:45.967 --> 31:48.433
And on that note,
that's enough for me.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.200
So, Bethan. You got in the shag
pad,
you didn't do fuck all.

32:02.267 --> 32:03.633
What about tonight?

32:03.700 --> 32:05.933
Think you're playing
a bit too hard to get?

32:06.000 --> 32:08.733
There's no such thing
as too hard to get.

32:08.800 --> 32:11.733
What if he gets bored?
If he's right for us, he'll
wait.

32:11.800 --> 32:15.033
What about touching him?
Well, that's a different story.

32:16.067 --> 32:20.333
'Howay, lasses. Beau might be
fit,
but he's got some grafting to
do.'

32:20.400 --> 32:23.333
Tahlia, if you want to pull,
Tup Tup is the place,

32:23.400 --> 32:25.200
cos that's where the worldies
go.

32:25.267 --> 32:27.367
You need to find someone
to neck on with.

32:27.433 --> 32:30.033
Just neck on! (laughs)

32:30.100 --> 32:32.167
'As the only single girl
in the house,

32:32.233 --> 32:36.067
I'm gonna have some fun. So
tonight,
this lass is on the pull.'

32:36.133 --> 32:38.667
I just wanna have a good night
with no drama,

32:38.733 --> 32:40.167
and I want to get mortal.

32:43.967 --> 32:46.300
(laughs)

32:46.367 --> 32:48.467
Erm, excuse me. I'm doing my
makeup.

32:48.533 --> 32:51.200
(laughs) Actually, bitch,
I'm doing my makeup.

32:51.267 --> 32:52.633
So, Beau.
Aye.

32:52.700 --> 32:55.800
How're you gonna play it?
Cos you're in the good books.

32:55.867 --> 32:57.600
I'm gonna play it as it is,

32:57.667 --> 33:00.833
I enjoy her company,
she's a good laugh,

33:00.900 --> 33:03.633
like, why fuckin' rattle the
cage,
know what I mean?

33:03.700 --> 33:06.667
'Not trying to rush.
I wish these lot would stop
asking,

33:06.733 --> 33:08.700
and let things develop
naturally.'

33:08.767 --> 33:11.300
Ever since you've got
in Bethan's good books,

33:11.367 --> 33:13.533
it's changed the dynamics
of the house.

33:13.600 --> 33:16.233
I've been able
to spend more time with Chloe...

33:16.300 --> 33:19.233
That's it, that's all
I'm bothered about. (laughs)

33:30.433 --> 33:34.333
Oh, Nathan Henry,
how are you single, baby girl?

33:34.400 --> 33:36.400
I don't know, baby girl.

33:36.467 --> 33:39.300
I am loving the vibe
in the house tonight.

33:39.367 --> 33:41.167
I can't wait to have a mint
night.

33:41.233 --> 33:45.733
A cheers to Bethan and Beau,
to looking like Barbie and Ken.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.467
(all) Barbie and Ken!

33:49.900 --> 33:51.800
'What the fuck?'

33:51.867 --> 33:54.200
'What is happening?'
(clattering)

33:55.033 --> 33:57.067
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

33:59.967 --> 34:00.167
.

34:02.667 --> 34:02.867
.

34:16.533 --> 34:20.132
'We get to the club, and
everyone's
in such a good mood tonight.'

34:20.199 --> 34:23.100
'I just know
we're gonna have the best time.'

34:33.766 --> 34:35.567
Me and Bethan are getting on
well.

34:35.632 --> 34:38.233
I'm happy about
where things are going.

34:42.699 --> 34:44.433
'Yay! Tequila!'

35:06.567 --> 35:10.033
I came to have fun, and me and
Nathan are the only single
people.

35:10.100 --> 35:11.267
So, let's pull.

35:20.867 --> 35:24.600
It's one thing, pecking someone
at work or at my house party,

35:24.667 --> 35:27.300
but the thought of
putting myself out there

35:27.367 --> 35:30.667
and chatting up complete
strangers
in a club is terrifying.

35:55.333 --> 35:58.833
Sophie is the only person
that understands how hard it is

35:58.900 --> 36:02.533
to see these couples together
when your other half isn't here.

36:13.433 --> 36:15.767
'It's hard,
being away from your partner,

36:15.833 --> 36:18.567
especially when
you're in the honeymoon stage,

36:18.633 --> 36:20.867
and you want to see them
all the time.'

36:48.067 --> 36:51.500
Obviously, when anyone finishes
with you or breaks up with you,

36:51.567 --> 36:54.667
you feel rejected, and you feel
like you're not good enough,

36:54.733 --> 36:57.067
and that's the point
that I'm at right now.

37:06.867 --> 37:09.533
I hate seeing Nathan like this,
low on confidence.

37:09.600 --> 37:11.933
Anybody would be lucky to have
him.

37:21.067 --> 37:24.433
This is probably the nicest
thing
Sam has ever said to me,

37:24.500 --> 37:27.800
and if he keeps on going,
I'm gonna burst out crying.

37:51.133 --> 37:55.033
When we came back, I never
thought
that Sam Gowland of all people

37:55.100 --> 37:58.767
would be the one that really
gets me
the way Chloe used to.

38:07.700 --> 38:10.367
'It is nice,
seeing Nathan and Sam really
close,

38:10.433 --> 38:13.267
but at the minute,
they look like they're on a
date.'

38:13.333 --> 38:17.167
'Hello! Remember me? Your
girlfriend
you live with that's got a dog?'

38:34.900 --> 38:38.133
'I might not go on the pull,
but I'll come with you, Tahlia.'

38:38.200 --> 38:39.533
That's what friends do.

38:45.100 --> 38:48.300
'There's absolute loads of
worldies
in Tup Tup tonight.'

38:48.367 --> 38:50.567
'The problem is, they're all
birds.'

38:57.067 --> 38:59.700
'Tahlia is determined
to pull tonight.'

38:59.767 --> 39:03.233
Lasses, lock up your lads.
There's a radgie on the loose!

39:06.300 --> 39:07.533
That lad is fit as fuck.

39:08.467 --> 39:11.333
Nathan, Sophie,
your work here is done.

39:20.800 --> 39:24.700
(cheering)

39:27.933 --> 39:29.933
Who's that? Has Tahlia pulled?

39:30.033 --> 39:31.567
'Get in!'

39:41.833 --> 39:44.933
'Natalie and Sophie are so keen
for me to pull.'

39:45.000 --> 39:46.567
But I'm just not ready.

39:46.633 --> 39:50.067
Maybes if I neck on with
Natalie,
they'll both just shut up.

39:50.900 --> 39:52.600
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

39:57.900 --> 39:59.133
What the fuck?

39:59.200 --> 40:03.067
This is not what I had in mind
when I gave Nathan that pep
talk.

40:05.733 --> 40:06.767
That was a laugh,

40:06.833 --> 40:10.100
but Nathan isn't as good a
kisser
as my girlfriend.

40:10.167 --> 40:14.000
'Let's get out of here before
this night goes off the rails!'

40:24.500 --> 40:27.200
If anyone wants chili sauce,
it's on my arm.

40:27.267 --> 40:28.667
Family time again!

40:29.600 --> 40:32.233
You've had a good night, Tahlia.
You played well.

40:32.300 --> 40:34.033
Man of the match.

40:34.100 --> 40:36.967
Are you all right?
Yeah, why? Why wouldn't I be?

40:37.033 --> 40:40.000
'It looks like Bethan's lost
interest
since we left.'

40:40.067 --> 40:42.967
I'm gonna remind her
why she fancies me. Be right
back.

40:43.033 --> 40:45.867
Take your jeans off, promise.
I've got you.

40:45.933 --> 40:49.400
Beau looks like he wants to
impress
Bethan with some sexy moves.

40:49.467 --> 40:52.267
'Luckily, my middle name
is Sexy Moves.'

40:53.700 --> 40:54.833
It's Ian, really.

40:55.733 --> 40:57.967
You go like this...
This is how you do it.

40:58.967 --> 41:01.033
I'm not doubting that.
Then you go...

41:01.100 --> 41:03.100
One step... oh, shit.

41:03.167 --> 41:04.867
Two step, and then...

41:04.933 --> 41:06.433
'Beau is a natural.'

41:06.500 --> 41:09.833
'But there is one thing
he does need a hand with.'

41:09.900 --> 41:12.367
D'you want that?
Mate, I think you need that.

41:14.633 --> 41:17.300
Natalie, can I ask a question?
Not being personal.

41:17.367 --> 41:20.767
But your girlfriend won't get
mad
that you and Nathan necked on?

41:20.833 --> 41:22.967
Gonna be honest,
I'm not entirely sure.

41:23.033 --> 41:24.933
'Chloe has got me thinking.'

41:25.000 --> 41:26.967
Have I just cheated on her?

41:27.033 --> 41:29.367
Enough of the fucking shite.

41:29.433 --> 41:33.533
Introducing the shamazing...
Beau-Beau!

41:33.600 --> 41:36.467
(cheering)

41:38.267 --> 41:41.300
'Oh, my God. What is happening?'

41:49.433 --> 41:53.133
'Oh, dear. This is not as
shamazing
as Sam said it was gonna be.'

41:57.533 --> 41:59.967
Oh, this is like watching
a horror movie.

42:02.100 --> 42:03.167
Whee!

42:04.933 --> 42:06.400
(all groan)

42:07.667 --> 42:10.267
This is an epic fucking fail.

42:11.300 --> 42:13.833
Was that supposed to impress
Bethan?
Yeah.

42:13.900 --> 42:16.067
(laughs)
Did that impress you?

42:16.133 --> 42:17.967
I am lost for words.

42:18.033 --> 42:19.967
I need to get him away from
everyone

42:20.033 --> 42:23.367
before he embarrasses himself
and me any more.

42:32.633 --> 42:34.433
(laughs)

42:38.900 --> 42:42.033
'There was a time when me and
Sam
used to own that shag pad.'

42:42.100 --> 42:45.167
'But look at wuh now!
We're like an old, married
couple.'

42:46.433 --> 42:49.467
'If I'm honest, the fact
I had to ask Sam for attention,

42:49.533 --> 42:52.633
since we've been back
we've only had sex for five
minutes,

42:52.700 --> 42:54.100
it's making me feel shit.'

43:00.633 --> 43:03.133
I want youse to see
what Belfast has to offer.

43:03.200 --> 43:06.100
I'm buzzing off my little
man-tits
to go to Belfast!

43:06.167 --> 43:07.900
Let's just have a wicked night!

43:07.967 --> 43:10.800
It's good to be away
with this lot for the first
time!

43:10.867 --> 43:12.600
Where are the boys?

43:14.067 --> 43:16.333
I'm sure I can hear
Bethan and Beau...

43:17.133 --> 43:20.267
'Sam and Nathan are making me
feel like a third wheel.'

43:20.333 --> 43:21.767
I don't want to be with you!

43:21.833 --> 43:23.700
What the hell has got into
Chloe?

43:23.767 --> 43:25.333
Psycho Chloe is back.

43:25.400 --> 43:27.933
I need to tell him how I feel.
Why'd you kick off?

43:28.000 --> 43:29.600
I think we should go on a break.

43:31.200 --> 43:32.400
(sobs)

43:58.433 --> 43:58.633
.
