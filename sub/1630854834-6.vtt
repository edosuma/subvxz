00:38.288 --> 00:40.540
Hey, Rick!

00:40.540 --> 00:42.167
Oh. Hey, Herb.

00:42.167 --> 00:45.211
So, you know what
this week is, right?

00:45.211 --> 00:47.172
Um, is it Easter?

00:47.172 --> 00:49.883
No, it's my spring break!

00:49.883 --> 00:52.010
No school for seven days!

00:52.010 --> 00:54.304
And guess what?
Go pack your things

00:54.304 --> 00:57.474
because you and I are going
on a big, romantic trip!

00:57.474 --> 00:58.767
Really?

00:58.767 --> 01:00.602
I just came
from the travel agent.

01:00.602 --> 01:02.145
We're gonna spend five nights

01:02.145 --> 01:05.273
in Myrtle Beach,
South Carolina.

01:06.483 --> 01:07.859
Oh.

01:07.859 --> 01:10.737
- Well, what's the matter?
- Myrtle Beach? Really?

01:10.737 --> 01:12.989
We all know what goes on
down there.

01:12.989 --> 01:15.408
I don't do that stuff anymore,
and neither should you.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.037
Rick, I don't wanna
go down there to rage.

01:19.037 --> 01:22.081
I just wanna sit on a beach
with you and watch the sunset.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.001
Yeah, but isn't Myrtle Beach
where those places are?

01:25.001 --> 01:27.754
I don't wanna go into
one of those places.

01:27.754 --> 01:29.506
I don't think they even exist anymore.

01:29.506 --> 01:31.925
Don't you think this is
just what we need, Rick?

01:31.925 --> 01:34.344
You don't even wanna
go into one of those places?

01:34.344 --> 01:35.845
Rick, I'm a little old
for that.

01:35.845 --> 01:38.056
It'd be pretty pathetic
if I did.

01:38.056 --> 01:39.516
Well...

01:39.516 --> 01:41.226
Okay.
- Ohh, Rick!

01:41.226 --> 01:42.852
We're gonna have the best time!

01:42.852 --> 01:44.270
I can't wait to spoil you.

01:44.270 --> 01:45.939
I really do need a vacation.

01:45.939 --> 01:50.109
Oh, we're gonna have the best
spring break of anyone!

01:51.069 --> 01:53.571
All right, guys.
You sure you packed everything?

01:53.571 --> 01:55.198
Yeah, that should be
all of it.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.951
Well, I hope you and Shelley
have a great spring break trip.

01:57.951 --> 01:59.911
I still feel bad,
us going on a trip

01:59.911 --> 02:01.621
while you and Stan stay home.

02:01.621 --> 02:03.081
You guys have fun
in Santa Fe.

02:03.081 --> 02:05.291
We're gonna do
some dad and son stuff.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.459
Goodbye, Shelley!

02:06.459 --> 02:09.045
Have fun! I'll miss you!

02:10.046 --> 02:12.215
There should be food enough
to last you the week.

02:12.215 --> 02:14.384
Yes, yes, don't worry.
We'll be fine.

02:14.384 --> 02:16.427
- Bye, Stan! Love you!
- Love you, Mom!

02:16.427 --> 02:19.514
- Okay, guys, be safe.
- Bye!

02:23.560 --> 02:25.728
Aww, jeah!

02:25.728 --> 02:28.231
Bitches are gone!

02:28.231 --> 02:31.067
Spring break!
Spring break! Spring break!

02:31.067 --> 02:33.152
This is gonna be
the best spring break ever.

02:33.152 --> 02:35.113
They're gonna be gone
the whole week!

02:36.364 --> 02:38.575
Bro, what are you doing?

02:38.575 --> 02:40.368
I'm painting miniatures.

02:40.368 --> 02:41.953
Painting min--

02:41.953 --> 02:43.580
Dude, do you not understand?

02:43.580 --> 02:45.415
Your mom and Shelley are gone.

02:45.415 --> 02:48.501
We can do whatever we want
without any stupid rules.

02:48.501 --> 02:49.586
Whatever I want?

02:49.586 --> 02:50.670
Yeah, dude!

02:50.670 --> 02:51.963
That's what this is all about.

02:51.963 --> 02:54.090
Let's do some
spring break shit!

02:54.090 --> 02:55.425
Can I see if any of the guys
wanna come over

02:55.425 --> 02:56.926
to do "40k" all week?

02:56.926 --> 02:58.761
Hell, yeah,
let's do some "40k."

02:58.761 --> 02:59.762
What is that?

02:59.762 --> 03:01.306
You don't know
"Warhammer 40k"?

03:01.306 --> 03:03.600
Oh, yeah,
"Warhammer 40k," of course.

03:03.600 --> 03:04.934
I'm down.
Let's do it.

03:04.934 --> 03:06.603
- Really? All week?
- Yeah, dude!

03:06.603 --> 03:07.770
You're old enough.

03:07.770 --> 03:10.106
Sweet! I'm gonna call
Tolkien!

03:18.698 --> 03:20.450
Oh, Rick.

03:20.450 --> 03:23.161
Isn't this nice?
This place is incredible.

03:23.161 --> 03:24.787
Yeah, it's really nice.

03:24.787 --> 03:26.831
I just don't know
if I deserve all this.

03:26.831 --> 03:28.583
You do deserve it, Rick.

03:28.583 --> 03:30.793
You've made me really happy.

03:30.793 --> 03:32.337
Are you almost done?

03:32.337 --> 03:35.298
Yeah, all done.
Here you go.

03:35.298 --> 03:38.134
Oh, Rick.
Look at how happy we are.

03:39.886 --> 03:42.722
Oh, that salt water air
is just so good.

03:42.722 --> 03:44.307
Can't wait to try
some Southern food.

03:44.307 --> 03:46.809
You hungry?
- Yeah, sure. I could eat.

03:46.809 --> 03:48.770
A lot of things are different
here in the South.

03:48.770 --> 03:50.480
Kinda hard to figure out
what's good.

03:50.480 --> 03:51.898
Yeah, all the stores

03:51.898 --> 03:53.566
and restaurants here
aren't like Colorado.

03:53.566 --> 03:55.234
It's almost like
another culture.

03:56.653 --> 03:57.654
Herb?

03:58.863 --> 04:00.239
Herb?

04:05.453 --> 04:07.455
Oh, no.
- Geez.

04:07.455 --> 04:09.040
It's still here.

04:13.169 --> 04:15.380
You said you wouldn't
go into one of these places.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.548
I don't wanna go in.
I just...

04:17.548 --> 04:19.634
can't believe some of these
places are still here.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.844
Whoa! Look who's here!

04:21.844 --> 04:23.763
What are you doing in town?

04:23.763 --> 04:26.015
Oh, I'm just on vacation.

04:26.015 --> 04:27.183
This is Rick.

04:27.183 --> 04:28.643
Well, do you wanna
come inside

04:28.643 --> 04:29.727
and rally a little bit?

04:29.727 --> 04:31.854
Oh, no thanks.
I don't rally anymore.

04:31.854 --> 04:33.731
You sure?
Everyone would love

04:33.731 --> 04:34.941
to rally with you again.

04:34.941 --> 04:36.985
I'm sure.
I don't need to rally.

04:36.985 --> 04:38.861
I'm just here to relax.
Take care.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.155
Well, if you change
your mind, we'll be here!

04:41.155 --> 04:42.615
America number one!

04:42.615 --> 04:44.826
Number one, yep.

04:44.826 --> 04:47.286
Some people, huh? Geez.

04:50.248 --> 04:52.875
Okay, so I'm gonna have
my Retributor Squad

04:52.875 --> 04:54.877
attack your
Stormhawk Interceptor.

04:54.877 --> 04:56.504
Okay, that has
a toughness of 7

04:56.504 --> 04:58.464
and a -1
to your hit rolls.

05:00.216 --> 05:02.218
Okay, so that's
three, four, five hits.

05:02.218 --> 05:04.345
Okay, I'm gonna roll
my saving throw, which is 3+.

05:04.345 --> 05:06.139
What in the actual fuck

05:06.139 --> 05:07.724
are you guys doing?

05:07.724 --> 05:09.183
We're playing "40k."

05:09.183 --> 05:12.020
You guys have wasted
another day of spring break

05:12.020 --> 05:14.814
with this stupid shit.

05:14.814 --> 05:17.900
Do you guys know
what spring break is about?

05:17.900 --> 05:20.820
Wet t-shirt contests,
mud wrestling.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.739
Don't you wanna get
some bitches over here?

05:22.739 --> 05:24.824
I thought you were happy
'cause the bitches were gone?

05:24.824 --> 05:26.284
I'm happy
the bitches are gone

05:26.284 --> 05:27.952
so we can have bitches over!

05:27.952 --> 05:30.246
Spring break is dude time.

05:30.246 --> 05:31.914
But you know what,

05:31.914 --> 05:34.042
today's society
has ruined it all.

05:35.752 --> 05:38.921
They've taught you boys
to be ashamed of being boys.

05:38.921 --> 05:43.426
Convinced you that your natural
innate male desires are toxic.

05:44.677 --> 05:46.804
No matter what the liberals
try to tell you, boys,

05:46.804 --> 05:49.348
you shouldn't be ashamed
of your gender.

05:49.348 --> 05:52.101
Okay, Dad. So I've got
an Imperium infantry unit

05:52.101 --> 05:53.311
within six inches
of Celestine,

05:53.311 --> 05:55.063
so they have a +6 save.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.607
My God.

05:57.607 --> 06:00.401
What are we going to do?

06:07.909 --> 06:09.786
I'm going to sleep.

06:09.786 --> 06:11.454
I'm gonna go to sleep now.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.004
Yeah, just browsing.

07:02.004 --> 07:04.340
You guys, it's him!
He's here!

07:04.340 --> 07:05.466
- Oh, wow, it is him!
- It's him?

07:06.592 --> 07:07.844
Is that really you?

07:07.844 --> 07:09.220
What are you doing here?

07:09.220 --> 07:10.763
Could I get
a selfie with you?

07:10.763 --> 07:12.723
Hey, uh, since you're here,

07:12.723 --> 07:14.100
you wanna rally a little bit?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.852
No, no. I can't rally

07:15.852 --> 07:18.271
I've got a serious boyfriend.
I'm just looking around.

07:18.271 --> 07:20.398
Oh, come on. When are you
gonna be here again?

07:20.398 --> 07:21.566
Live a little!

07:21.566 --> 07:24.026
Well, maybe I could do
just a little bit.

07:24.026 --> 07:25.862
I mean, wha--

07:25.862 --> 07:28.865
What the hell is up
with all these Mexicans? Huh?

07:30.533 --> 07:33.119
Yeah! I mean--I mean,
Joe Biden obviously thinks

07:33.119 --> 07:34.954
immigrants are made of gold
or something.

07:34.954 --> 07:37.206
Piece of shit!

07:37.206 --> 07:39.584
Yeah! Yeah!

07:45.298 --> 07:46.924
Hey, Steven.
You know your son's

07:46.924 --> 07:48.759
been over at my house
for spring break?

07:48.759 --> 07:50.553
Yeah, of course I know.

07:50.553 --> 07:53.055
Well, you should see
what they're doing,

07:53.055 --> 07:55.892
'cause it's a little hrrrp.

07:55.892 --> 07:57.393
Well--well,
what are they doing?

07:57.393 --> 07:59.937
Look, I just think
we better talk with our boys

07:59.937 --> 08:02.398
to counteract all the ways
in which society

08:02.398 --> 08:05.193
has been pathologizing masculinity.

08:05.193 --> 08:07.570
I mean, you went balls-out
on spring break, right?

08:07.570 --> 08:10.281
Tried to see chicks' boobs
and stuff?

08:10.281 --> 08:12.325
Mm, no I didn't.

08:12.325 --> 08:14.410
Well, no, I mean,
you weren't ashamed

08:14.410 --> 08:15.995
of being a guy, right?

08:15.995 --> 08:17.246
Like, you went out to the lake

08:17.246 --> 08:19.582
and tried to play grab ass
with girls, right?

08:19.582 --> 08:22.501
No, I did not.

08:22.501 --> 08:25.087
Why--why are you saying that?

08:25.087 --> 08:27.924
Why are you making
those words with your mouth?

08:27.924 --> 08:30.301
Oh, hey, Randy.
Everything okay with the boys?

08:30.301 --> 08:32.386
Ohh, right.

08:32.386 --> 08:34.472
Sorry--sorry, yeah,
everything's great.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.183
They're playing a little
table miniatures game.

08:37.183 --> 08:39.352
It's great.

08:39.352 --> 08:41.812
Just, uh, came to let you know
they're good.

08:41.812 --> 08:42.939
Don't worry.

08:42.939 --> 08:44.982
I'm gonna take care of it.

08:46.609 --> 08:47.777
I'll tell you what else.

08:47.777 --> 08:49.820
This whole situation
in the Ukraine,

08:49.820 --> 08:51.572
that wouldn't be happening
on my watch.

08:53.032 --> 08:56.410
The problem is now we all have
a president who's afraid.

08:56.410 --> 08:59.497
And that's why Joe and the ho
have got to go!

09:00.831 --> 09:02.667
And I'll tell you
another thing.

09:02.667 --> 09:04.460
It's--oh, hang on a second.

09:06.045 --> 09:07.213
Oh, crap.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.631
Ho--hold on a second, everybody.

09:08.631 --> 09:10.800
Uh--

09:13.010 --> 09:14.971
Oh, hey, Rick!

09:14.971 --> 09:16.180
Where are you?

09:16.180 --> 09:17.557
I couldn't sleep, Rick.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.891
I was just tossing and turning

09:18.891 --> 09:20.142
and I didn't wanna wake you up,

09:20.142 --> 09:22.645
so I decided to come out
and buy some sunscreen

09:22.645 --> 09:24.313
and stuff
for our beach day tomorrow.

09:24.313 --> 09:26.023
Oh, okay.

09:26.023 --> 09:28.567
I got scared
that you were out rallying.

09:28.567 --> 09:30.861
Ohh, geez,
well, that's silly.

09:30.861 --> 09:33.072
Last thing I wanna do
is rally.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.532
Listen up--
get back to sleep, Rick.

09:34.532 --> 09:35.950
I'll--I'll be right home, okay?

09:35.950 --> 09:38.536
Okay. Sorry for panicking. Bye.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.329
Bye-bye.

09:40.329 --> 09:41.789
Okay, uh, nice to meet you, everybody.

09:41.789 --> 09:43.165
I need to get going.

09:43.165 --> 09:44.959
Oh, come on. Just rally
with us a little bit more.

09:44.959 --> 09:46.252
No, I really can't.

09:46.252 --> 09:48.254
Just a few more minutes.
Come on!

09:49.338 --> 09:52.174
All right, I guess I can
rally just a little bit longer.

09:52.174 --> 09:54.051
I mean, after all,
I am here for you.

09:54.051 --> 09:56.345
I am your warrior!

09:56.345 --> 09:57.763
Liberal left!

09:57.763 --> 09:59.473
Hunter Biden laptop!

10:00.850 --> 10:03.311
Yeah! Yeah!

10:15.197 --> 10:16.532
Uh--

10:16.532 --> 10:18.868
Ugh. Oh, geez.

10:18.868 --> 10:20.828
Herb?
Herb, you gotta get up.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.872
We're gonna miss
our whole beach day.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.875
Oh, it's--it's just
the time change, Rick.

10:25.875 --> 10:27.043
You enjoy the beach.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.587
I just gotta sleep
a little longer.

10:29.587 --> 10:31.088
Okay.

10:49.732 --> 10:50.941
Dude, it's so awesome
being able

10:50.941 --> 10:52.234
to leave "Warhammer"
set up all night

10:52.234 --> 10:53.361
and come back to it
in the morning.

10:53.361 --> 10:55.363
I know, it's great.

10:55.363 --> 10:58.240
Hey, hey, you guys.
What did you do?

10:58.240 --> 11:00.242
- What do you mean?
- I mean the cops are here.

11:00.242 --> 11:01.827
What did you guys do?

11:03.037 --> 11:05.498
We're just continuing our
game of "40k" from last night.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.916
Okay, you guys,
just stop

11:06.916 --> 11:09.085
'cause the police wanna ask you
some questions.

11:09.085 --> 11:10.419
Come on in, officers.

11:10.419 --> 11:12.588
Hello, gentlemen.

11:12.588 --> 11:13.756
Hands up.

11:13.756 --> 11:16.175
We heard somebody in here's
been bad.

11:16.175 --> 11:18.844
Oh, no, guys. Looks like
you're in big trouble.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.638
You better read 'em
their rights.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.306
Hey, whoa, whoa!
Don't touch the models.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.599
We spent a long time on this.

11:23.599 --> 11:25.017
Stan, stop with that shit.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.185
Come on, get into it.

11:26.185 --> 11:28.354
Wet t-shirt contest!

11:28.354 --> 11:30.106
Hey, what the fuck?

11:30.106 --> 11:32.400
- What?
- Hey, you fuck guy!

11:32.400 --> 11:34.151
You do not harass the ladies!

11:34.151 --> 11:36.445
Well, I wanted strippers,
not prudes.

11:36.445 --> 11:38.739
You wanna talk, big man? Huh?

11:38.739 --> 11:40.366
You wanna be big man?

11:40.366 --> 11:41.742
Whoa, whoa, okay. I--

11:41.742 --> 11:44.328
I think I need to explain
something to you, okay?

11:44.328 --> 11:46.622
Look, I'm just trying to combat
the messages

11:46.622 --> 11:48.624
that the liberal left
is putting out to young men

11:48.624 --> 11:51.460
about their male instincts
being toxic.

11:51.460 --> 11:52.837
The fuck you talking?

11:52.837 --> 11:54.463
You know,
I'm trying to show my son

11:54.463 --> 11:56.507
and his nerdy little friend
what a real party is

11:56.507 --> 11:58.551
'cause society wants them
to be ashamed

11:58.551 --> 12:00.678
of their masculine natures.

12:00.678 --> 12:03.097
- You want real party?
- Yeah!

12:03.097 --> 12:05.558
Truth is, I got a whole barn
full of weed.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.811
I will call some friends.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.652
<i>The person you are
trying to reach</i>

12:16.652 --> 12:18.154
<i>cannot be located.</i>

12:18.154 --> 12:20.448
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

12:20.448 --> 12:21.699
Where are you?

12:21.699 --> 12:23.742
I got back from the beach
and you were gone.

12:23.742 --> 12:25.244
Please pick up.

12:39.383 --> 12:42.094
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

12:46.390 --> 12:48.350
And we're gonna take Georgia,

12:48.350 --> 12:51.061
and--and we're gonna
take Arizona this time!

12:52.521 --> 12:55.191
And when I say we're gonna take
Arizona in the election,

12:55.191 --> 12:56.734
I--I mean we're gonna
take it again.

12:56.734 --> 12:59.069
'cause we all know
I won it last time, too!

12:59.069 --> 13:03.365
Oh. Hey, everybody.

13:03.365 --> 13:04.742
This is Rick.

13:08.954 --> 13:11.373
Rick! Rick,
will you just wait!

13:12.124 --> 13:13.751
You know it's 2:00
in the morning?

13:13.751 --> 13:16.545
I was alone at the hotel
while you were out rallying!

13:16.545 --> 13:19.215
I just wanted to rally
for a little bit.

13:19.215 --> 13:21.675
Yeah, you really look like
you just rallied a little bit.

13:21.675 --> 13:24.053
I got a text
that Tucker was in town,

13:24.053 --> 13:26.514
and I just wanted to go rally
for a little bit.

13:26.514 --> 13:29.016
You really think those people
care about you, Herb?

13:29.016 --> 13:31.769
They don't.
They just wanna do that.

13:31.769 --> 13:34.563
Rick, I got it
out of my system now.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.232
We can still have
a great vacation.

13:36.232 --> 13:37.900
Let's just start over tomorrow.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.610
Okay?

13:48.702 --> 13:51.330
Right, all right,
let's do this!

13:51.330 --> 13:52.373
Okay, you ready?

13:52.373 --> 13:54.917
Three, two, one. Go!

13:54.917 --> 13:57.253
Check it out, guys!

13:58.629 --> 14:00.297
Ahh!

14:00.297 --> 14:01.590
Huh? Whoa!

14:05.427 --> 14:07.263
Sir, do you think
you can walk?

14:07.263 --> 14:09.098
No, I don't think so.

14:09.098 --> 14:11.433
Sir, we think you've had
too much to drink,

14:11.433 --> 14:13.269
and we should probably
take you to the hospital.

14:13.269 --> 14:15.312
No, I can't.
I have to stay here

14:15.312 --> 14:17.022
'cause I'm in charge
of my son.

14:17.022 --> 14:19.483
Today's woke culture
has vilified his manhood

14:19.483 --> 14:21.193
and made him ashamed
of himself.

14:21.193 --> 14:23.904
Okay, sir, but it appears
you have a broken arm

14:23.904 --> 14:25.447
and several fractured ribs.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.074
Yeah, but I can't leave

14:27.074 --> 14:29.618
because my son's natural
instincts are being suppressed

14:29.618 --> 14:31.704
and it's leading
to behavioral problems.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.289
You see the shit he's doing?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.958
He's over there
playing with dolls.

14:43.215 --> 14:45.342
It's pretty good fondue, right?

14:46.760 --> 14:48.721
We should probably
just go back to the hotel.

14:48.721 --> 14:50.723
You've got the shakes
from rallying all night.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.350
No, no, Rick.
This is our vacation.

14:53.350 --> 14:54.977
I want us to have a nice

14:54.977 --> 14:56.812
romantic lunch.

14:56.812 --> 14:59.064
Maybe we should
just go back to Colorado.

14:59.064 --> 15:02.026
No, Rick.
I'm gonna make this up to you.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.611
I don't wanna rally anymore.

15:03.611 --> 15:05.154
There's just a lot of people
out there

15:05.154 --> 15:07.156
who won't let it go, you know?

15:07.156 --> 15:08.824
Yes, and you can't
be around them.

15:08.824 --> 15:10.826
I know, I know.

15:10.826 --> 15:12.244
Let me just--

15:12.244 --> 15:14.997
Let me just go throw up
because I'll feel much better.

15:14.997 --> 15:17.166
Okay, go throw up, Herb.

15:28.469 --> 15:29.553
Oh, God.

15:29.553 --> 15:31.764
Come on, just stop. Stop.

15:31.764 --> 15:33.349
The country is fine.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.017
You have better things to do.

15:55.663 --> 15:58.874
Yeah, oh yeah!
That's it! Yeah!

15:58.874 --> 16:01.293
We're gonna get abortion rights
thrown the hell out

16:01.293 --> 16:04.338
so those dirty lesbians
can't keep having abortions!

16:04.338 --> 16:06.131
Yeah! Oh, yeah, man!

16:06.131 --> 16:08.592
We're gonna get those Black
Lives Matter protestors

16:08.592 --> 16:10.469
off the streets
with a fire hose!

16:10.469 --> 16:12.721
Yeah, America!
both: Yeah!

16:12.721 --> 16:13.889
Rick!

16:13.889 --> 16:15.849
Fuck you.

16:17.768 --> 16:19.436
Well, to hell with you!

16:19.436 --> 16:21.063
Nobody controls me!

16:21.063 --> 16:24.274
- Yeah!
- Yeah! America! Yeah!

16:37.705 --> 16:39.373
Can I help you?

16:39.373 --> 16:41.083
We've had some complaints
about a party

16:41.083 --> 16:43.001
that's been going on
for three days here.

16:43.001 --> 16:44.420
Hey, what's going on?

16:46.046 --> 16:48.424
All right, guys,
who ordered the stripper?

16:48.424 --> 16:50.551
Can we come in
and look around, sir?

16:50.551 --> 16:52.594
Oh, yeah! Come on in.

16:52.594 --> 16:54.596
Honk honk!

16:54.596 --> 16:55.973
All right,
get down on the ground!

16:55.973 --> 16:58.016
Whoa, whoa! No, no, no.
It's okay.

16:58.016 --> 16:59.309
I'm just helping my boy

16:59.309 --> 17:00.978
through the media assault
on manliness.

17:00.978 --> 17:04.189
Ahh! Ahh! Ahh!

17:04.189 --> 17:05.774
I need to see some ID, sir.

17:05.774 --> 17:08.777
Uh! Okay!
Okay, Stan! Stan!

17:08.777 --> 17:10.696
Yeah?

17:10.696 --> 17:13.115
Can you get my wallet
from the upstairs?

17:13.115 --> 17:15.284
Yeah, soon as we're done
with this psyker phase.

17:15.284 --> 17:16.702
I have five psyker units.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.038
Oh, my God.
This is so embarrassing.

17:20.456 --> 17:23.167
Hey! Freeze!
You, right there!

17:23.167 --> 17:26.295
That's Alonzo Fineski,
the Romanian sex trafficker!

17:26.295 --> 17:27.713
Fuck you, big man!

17:30.466 --> 17:32.176
Ahh! Oh, my God!

17:32.176 --> 17:34.011
Ahh!

17:37.097 --> 17:39.975
Stan? Stan?

17:48.776 --> 17:50.694
<i>And now,
ladies and gentlemen,</i>

17:50.694 --> 17:52.613
<i>here he is,</i>

17:52.613 --> 17:54.990
<i>the once and future president</i>

17:54.990 --> 17:56.992
<i>of the United States
of America!</i>

18:03.165 --> 18:06.460
<i>Thank you.
I am here today</i>

18:06.460 --> 18:08.712
for those who have
been wronged.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.425
For those who have been betrayed.

18:13.425 --> 18:15.719
And let me tell you

18:15.719 --> 18:19.681
that nobody in this country
has been betrayed more

18:19.681 --> 18:21.975
than my Ricky Rick.

18:21.975 --> 18:23.936
Huh? What?

18:23.936 --> 18:27.523
Rick, I am so sorry.

18:27.523 --> 18:29.358
<i>And if you are out there,</i>

18:29.358 --> 18:32.194
<i>I want you to know
that I love you.</i>

18:32.194 --> 18:34.279
<i>You are the only thing
that keeps me from doing</i>

18:34.279 --> 18:36.740
<i>all this stupid stuff.</i>

18:36.740 --> 18:39.701
<i>When I met you,
I felt in control of myself</i>

18:39.701 --> 18:41.620
<i>for the first time.</i>

18:41.620 --> 18:45.415
There has never been anyone
who calmed me down more

18:45.415 --> 18:48.544
than my little Ricky Bear.

18:48.544 --> 18:50.587
You are my boo.

18:50.587 --> 18:54.591
Did he just say
that Rick is his boo?

18:54.591 --> 18:58.720
<i>The truth is, some of us
simply can't be alone.</i>

18:58.720 --> 19:03.725
<i>We need a relationship so that
we're accountable to someone.</i>

19:03.725 --> 19:06.812
<i>I realize now
how broken I am</i>

19:06.812 --> 19:11.400
<i>without that person who keeps
me from destroying myself.</i>

19:11.400 --> 19:12.901
Sh-Sharon?

19:12.901 --> 19:16.613
<i>And all I've ever done
was take you for granted</i>

19:16.613 --> 19:19.324
<i>and wished I wasn't
being controlled.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:22.286
Hi, Sharon.

19:22.286 --> 19:25.414
Will you please come home?

19:25.414 --> 19:29.001
<i>Rick, I am a giant
piece of shit without you.</i>

19:29.001 --> 19:31.587
<i>I don't deserve
another chance.</i>

19:31.587 --> 19:33.297
<i>You have been wronged.</i>

19:33.297 --> 19:35.757
<i>You have been betrayed.</i>

19:35.757 --> 19:40.929
And the only person
who deserves retribution is me.

19:41.889 --> 19:46.101
I know you all really want
to rally and rage, but...

19:46.101 --> 19:49.271
the only thing
I have to say is...

19:49.271 --> 19:53.400
is that I love Rick.

19:53.400 --> 19:58.238
I love Rick!
I love Rick!

19:58.238 --> 20:02.367
I love Rick.

20:02.367 --> 20:06.997
I love Rick!
I love Rick!

20:06.997 --> 20:10.876
I love Rick!
- I love you, Rick!

20:10.876 --> 20:14.004
all: I love Rick!
I love Rick!

20:14.004 --> 20:16.131
I love Rick!
- Yeah!

20:16.131 --> 20:18.759
all: I love Rick!

20:18.759 --> 20:20.969
I love Rick!
I love Rick!

20:20.969 --> 20:23.805
I love Rick! I love Rick!

20:23.805 --> 20:25.015
I love Rick!

20:25.015 --> 20:26.934
Oh, crap.
Here we go again!

20:26.934 --> 20:28.685
all: I love Rick!
I love Rick!

20:28.685 --> 20:29.853
I love--

20:43.075 --> 20:45.118
It's okay, Randy.
We're back.

20:45.118 --> 20:49.039
I'm sorry
I cut your trip short.

20:49.039 --> 20:50.707
It's okay, Randy.

20:50.707 --> 20:53.126
You made it longer
than last spring break.

20:58.924 --> 21:00.884
- Oh. Hey, Mom.
- Stanley,

21:00.884 --> 21:02.552
what have I told you
about playing "Warhammer"

21:02.552 --> 21:05.138
on the kitchen table?
- Aw!

21:21.613 --> 21:23.573
Oh, Rick!

21:26.243 --> 21:28.912
I don't wanna go
through all that again.

21:28.912 --> 21:32.290
I just wanna stay
in South Park with you.

21:32.290 --> 21:36.169
Well, I guess we'll just
have to see what happens.
