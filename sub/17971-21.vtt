00:00.967 --> 00:02.701
♪

00:02.703 --> 00:04.870
Oh, Donna,
I'm so excited.

00:04.872 --> 00:06.372
I thought this day
would never come.

00:06.374 --> 00:10.109
Cleveland, it's the reading
of your ex-wife's will.

00:10.111 --> 00:11.276
I know!

00:11.278 --> 00:12.711
How you holding up,
big man?

00:12.713 --> 00:13.412
Well, I'm okay,

00:13.414 --> 00:15.681
but a part of me wishes
Mom would come back

00:15.683 --> 00:17.516
so I could say
a proper good-bye.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.651
Well, she's been gone
for three months.

00:19.653 --> 00:21.420
I mean, if she
came back now,

00:21.422 --> 00:23.422
her skin would be
all gray and rotten,

00:23.424 --> 00:26.558
and she'd need to feast
on the living to survive.

00:26.560 --> 00:27.960
But you remember
what to do

00:27.962 --> 00:29.395
if she <i>does</i>
<i>come back, right?</i>

00:29.397 --> 00:32.531
Destroy the head
or remove the brain.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.232
Mm-hmm.

00:33.234 --> 00:34.900
Well, I've looked over
Loretta's will,

00:34.902 --> 00:36.769
and it's pretty
straightforward.

00:36.771 --> 00:39.638
"I, Loretta Marie Callender
Brown, blah-blah-blah,

00:39.640 --> 00:42.908
"do hereby leave my entire
estate to my son,

00:42.910 --> 00:45.978
"Cleveland Orenthal Brown, Jr.,
blah-blah-blah.

00:45.980 --> 00:47.679
"He is to have
unfettered access

00:47.681 --> 00:50.749
to all assets
in the amount of..."

00:50.751 --> 00:52.885
Hey, hey, hey!

00:52.887 --> 00:53.952
Let me see that!

00:53.954 --> 00:55.854
I'm sorry, Cleveland,
but the will stipulates

00:55.856 --> 00:59.425
that you were to have
no knowledge of its details.

00:59.427 --> 01:02.327
Look at these
juicy details.

01:02.329 --> 01:02.861
Oh!

01:02.863 --> 01:04.797
Cleveland,
I know how difficult

01:04.799 --> 01:05.764
this must be for you;

01:05.766 --> 01:07.232
your cheating ex-wife
got everything

01:07.234 --> 01:08.534
in the divorce
and gave it all

01:08.536 --> 01:11.870
to your dim-witted
or possibly brilliant son.

01:11.872 --> 01:12.704
Dang!

01:12.706 --> 01:15.874
Now, you could contest the will
and sue Junior for the money.

01:15.876 --> 01:19.611
In the law profession,
we call that a "dick" move.

01:19.613 --> 01:20.479
It's okay, Daddy.

01:20.481 --> 01:22.648
I'll lend you all
the money you need.

01:22.650 --> 01:23.816
I'm rich!

01:23.818 --> 01:27.619
Ee... Unfortunately, Junior,
the will also states

01:27.621 --> 01:29.555
that if you give a single penny
to your father,

01:29.557 --> 01:33.892
Loretta's entire estate will go
to a Mr. Glenn Quagmire

01:33.894 --> 01:35.360
of Quahog,
Rhode Island.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.295
What?!

01:36.297 --> 01:37.830
Or you can risk it all

01:37.832 --> 01:40.566
for whatever's behind
door #2!

01:40.568 --> 01:42.534
ALL:
Take the money!
Take the money!

01:42.536 --> 01:45.704
Len, I'm gonna keep the contents
of the will.

01:45.706 --> 01:50.909
Then let's take a look
at what you didn't choose!

Mm, these times.

02:58.412 --> 02:59.378
Morning, Dad.

02:59.380 --> 03:00.679
Check out
my new Eddie Bauer

03:00.681 --> 03:03.048
limited edition
Boba Fett costume.

with a safari vest

03:04.051 --> 03:06.118
and a contrived sense
of adventure.

03:06.120 --> 03:07.953
I also got
a shawarma machine

03:07.955 --> 03:11.990
so I can have succulent
lamb meat 24/7!

03:11.992 --> 03:15.794
Mmm! If I ever did switch
to the Dark Side,

03:15.796 --> 03:18.797
I'll call myself
"Darth Shawarma."

03:18.799 --> 03:19.865
(giggles)

03:19.867 --> 03:20.799
Mmm, I had to pay

03:20.801 --> 03:22.901
my cell phone bill
with nickels.

03:22.903 --> 03:25.037
How was your shopping spree,
Miss Donna?

03:25.039 --> 03:25.971
It was great, Junior,

03:25.973 --> 03:28.006
and thank you
for letting me use

03:28.008 --> 03:29.041
your new AMEX card.

03:29.043 --> 03:31.476
Cleveland only has
a prepaid debit card

03:31.478 --> 03:32.844
for Magic Johnson's bank.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.814
Yeah, everyone thought
they'd be gone years ago,

03:35.816 --> 03:37.216
but they're still kicking.

03:37.218 --> 03:38.217
Doing well, too!

03:38.219 --> 03:39.952
God bless you, Magic!

03:39.954 --> 03:42.621
Hey, Junior,
do you have my check?

03:42.623 --> 03:43.522
Here you go.

03:43.524 --> 03:45.490
What are you giving
her money for?

03:45.492 --> 03:47.159
So I can buy
another new hat.

03:47.161 --> 03:48.560
That's my thing.

03:48.562 --> 03:49.394
I wear hats now.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.163
Beep-beep!
Move it or lose it.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.431
Hey, Donald Plump,

03:52.433 --> 03:53.565
is my barbershop chair
here yet?

03:53.567 --> 03:57.169
Not yet, but I'll let you know
as soon as it arrives.

03:57.171 --> 03:57.736
Cool.

03:57.738 --> 04:00.572
Hey, old man,
you got change
for a hundred?

04:00.574 --> 04:01.173
(laughs)

04:01.175 --> 04:02.474
I'm just joshin'.

04:02.476 --> 04:03.609
I know you don't.

04:03.611 --> 04:05.277
Okay, enough of
this bullcrap!

04:05.279 --> 04:07.679
How much money did
your mother leave you?

04:07.681 --> 04:09.514
Well, I'm not allowed
to tell you,

04:09.516 --> 04:11.750
but suffice it to say,
it was substantial.

04:11.752 --> 04:15.220
With the sale of your deli,
Mom's life insurance policy,

04:15.222 --> 04:17.656
and the reckless homicide
settlement I got

04:17.658 --> 04:19.725
from Peter Griffin,
I did just fine.

04:19.727 --> 04:20.759
Apparently, to pay for it,

04:20.761 --> 04:23.095
Mr. Griffin had to get
a series of new jobs.

04:23.097 --> 04:25.998
I didn't see it, but I heard
it was hilarious.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.766
Not as hilarious
as it would have been

04:27.768 --> 04:28.800
two or three years ago,

04:28.802 --> 04:31.069
but there was still some
solid laughs there.

04:31.071 --> 04:34.806
Daddy, if this money's
gonna come between us,

04:34.808 --> 04:37.843
I'll give it all back.

04:37.845 --> 04:40.812
Better not make he
give all back.

04:40.814 --> 04:42.914
Kill you mo, take my money.

04:42.916 --> 04:45.484
No, Junior,
I don't want you

04:45.486 --> 04:47.753
to give back the money.

04:49.455 --> 04:52.691
Good call, old man.

Mom! What are you
doing in town?!

05:03.737 --> 05:06.838
Hello, dear! I wanted to come by
and thank Junior in person

05:06.840 --> 05:08.607
for the beautiful gift
he sent me.

05:08.609 --> 05:10.142
(whistles appreciatively)

05:10.144 --> 05:12.210
That is swe-et!

05:12.212 --> 05:14.112
Oh, Cookie,
it's you.

05:14.114 --> 05:14.780
I thought I felt

05:14.782 --> 05:17.316
the joy being sucked
out of my life.

05:17.318 --> 05:17.849
Grandma!

05:17.851 --> 05:19.751
There's my little
chameleon-aire.

05:19.753 --> 05:22.821
Well, well, well,
look at you.

05:22.823 --> 05:23.555
Your kid's rich,

05:23.557 --> 05:25.223
and you're still
a broke-ass little chump.

05:25.225 --> 05:27.859
And good morrow
to you, Father.

05:27.861 --> 05:29.161
What are you guys
doing here?

05:29.163 --> 05:31.063
We have some very
exciting news.

05:31.065 --> 05:33.131
Cleveland, your father
and I are moving back

05:33.133 --> 05:36.935
into our old house
right here in Stoolbend.

05:36.937 --> 05:37.769
What?!
Yay!

05:37.771 --> 05:39.271
Sweet greens
and submarines!

05:39.273 --> 05:40.238
Why are you doing that?!

05:40.240 --> 05:43.275
Because your mama and I
are getting remarried.

05:43.277 --> 05:45.010
Get used to this
face, C cup,

05:45.012 --> 05:47.646
'cause you gonna see it
all the damn time.

05:47.648 --> 05:48.280
(both gasp)

05:48.282 --> 05:51.516
And that is what we call
an "uh-oh moment."

05:51.518 --> 05:52.351
Any questions?

05:52.353 --> 05:54.786
Have you ever had
a screenplay produced?

05:54.788 --> 05:56.221
Yes, I had a play produced.

05:56.223 --> 05:58.657
I said screenplay.
Class dismissed.

06:02.862 --> 06:04.663
Remarrying Dad?

06:04.665 --> 06:06.798
Excuse me.

06:10.203 --> 06:11.370
What are you doing?

06:11.372 --> 06:12.971
I'm looking for your marbles

06:12.973 --> 06:16.274
because apparently,
you've lost them!

06:16.276 --> 06:17.943
Now, Cleveland,
I know your father and I

06:17.945 --> 06:21.780
have had our problems,
but those days are behind us.

06:21.782 --> 06:23.215
So you're just gonna forget

06:23.217 --> 06:24.716
about the Waffle House
waitresses

06:24.718 --> 06:26.718
and the JetBlue
stewardesses

06:26.720 --> 06:28.186
and Greta Van Susteren?

06:28.188 --> 06:30.021
That's all in the past, tubby.

06:30.023 --> 06:30.822
I've changed.

06:30.824 --> 06:32.758
9/11 will do that to a man.

06:32.760 --> 06:34.926
9/11 was a decade ago!

06:34.928 --> 06:36.094
I ain't got no Internet.

06:36.096 --> 06:38.397
Besides, I don't want
to die alone.

06:38.399 --> 06:38.997
Did you know

06:38.999 --> 06:40.999
that not a single man
in our family

06:41.001 --> 06:43.034
has lived past
the age of 63?

06:43.036 --> 06:43.869
(gulps)

06:43.871 --> 06:44.636
I did not.

06:44.638 --> 06:47.973
And I'm gonna need someone
to take care of me.

06:47.975 --> 06:48.807
How romantic.

06:48.809 --> 06:50.876
What the hell you know
about romance, Clarissa?

06:50.878 --> 06:53.745
You been with, what,
five women in your whole life?

06:53.747 --> 06:56.615
I pleasured over 500 ladies
in my time.

06:56.617 --> 06:58.683
And one guy.

06:58.685 --> 06:59.885
I think we all

06:59.887 --> 07:00.986
just need
to calm down.

07:00.988 --> 07:04.389
Just because you put on weight
doesn't make you Oprah.

07:04.391 --> 07:05.190
(angry grunt)

07:05.192 --> 07:06.324
I think it's great

07:06.326 --> 07:07.993
you two are
getting remarried.

07:07.995 --> 07:08.927
It's like recycling,

07:08.929 --> 07:12.664
except this isn't a complete
waste of time and effort.

07:12.666 --> 07:13.999
See? Beanbag chair
gets it.

07:14.001 --> 07:16.234
Ooh! I just had
a brainstorm!

07:16.236 --> 07:19.137
And not the bad kind
I take medication for.

07:19.139 --> 07:21.339
You should have
the wedding here

07:21.341 --> 07:22.140
in the backyard,

07:22.142 --> 07:24.242
and I'll pay
for the whole thing.

07:24.244 --> 07:25.510
Oh, Junior,
we couldn't.

07:25.512 --> 07:27.345
Bup-bup-bup!
Not another word.

07:27.347 --> 07:29.080
It's my gift to you.

07:29.082 --> 07:30.849
I'm doing it.
It's done.

07:30.851 --> 07:34.052
This is gonna be
the best wedding ever!

07:35.154 --> 07:38.089
Okay, that was one
of the bad brainstorms.

07:38.091 --> 07:41.293
For a second, I thought
I was a falcon.

07:41.295 --> 07:42.661
But I'm okay now.

07:42.663 --> 07:46.231
I'm gonna go lie down.

07:48.100 --> 07:50.368
Now we have to host
the wedding?!

07:50.370 --> 07:51.203
I don't know why

07:51.205 --> 07:53.371
she'd still want
to be with him.

07:53.373 --> 07:55.307
The man's a grade-A heel.

07:55.309 --> 07:58.443
Mm, now <i>there's</i> a crease.

07:58.445 --> 08:00.645
I don't think
it's so surprising.

08:00.647 --> 08:02.080
Every woman loves
a bad boy.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.416
They're dangerous,
passionate, unpredictable.

08:04.418 --> 08:06.952
Just when you're
about to yell at him

08:06.954 --> 08:08.386
for punching out
a cop's horse,

08:08.388 --> 08:09.454
he does something
nice for you

08:09.456 --> 08:12.257
like shave your name
in the side of his head.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.826
You try to tame him,
but you can't.

08:14.828 --> 08:16.828
He's a wild animal.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.296
(sighs)
But eventually,

08:18.298 --> 08:20.398
you settle for stable
and predictable.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.900
I bet you
can't predict

08:21.902 --> 08:23.635
what I'm gonna
try tonight.

08:23.637 --> 08:26.638
(sighs)
I bet I can.

08:27.206 --> 08:28.840
No, Cleveland!

08:28.842 --> 08:29.841
I love you.

08:29.843 --> 08:30.876
I love you, too.

08:30.878 --> 08:32.143
Cut it out!
Why?!

08:32.145 --> 08:34.346
Good night, Cleveland.

08:34.348 --> 08:36.281
Damn it, I said
good night!

08:36.283 --> 08:38.149
I heard you
the first time!

08:38.151 --> 08:40.151
Junior, you need
my help.

08:40.153 --> 08:42.521
No one knows more about
weddings than I do.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.155
I even saw most
of <i>Bride Wars</i>

08:44.157 --> 08:46.324
until my body shut down
to protect itself.

08:46.326 --> 08:47.792
I'm kind of busy
right now!

08:47.794 --> 08:51.429
Yeah, crème brulée
is a great dessert.

08:51.431 --> 08:53.131
Maybe I'll also order
a time machine

08:53.133 --> 08:55.901
to take this wedding
back to 1998!

08:55.903 --> 08:57.469
Honestly, Roberta,

08:57.471 --> 08:59.471
I don't know how
your mother ended up

08:59.473 --> 09:01.273
with such an
attractive daughter.

09:01.275 --> 09:03.542
Look, I'll tell you
the same thing

09:03.544 --> 09:05.510
I told my P.E. teacher
Miss Rayborn.

09:05.512 --> 09:09.180
Look at 'em all you want,
but if you try to touch 'em,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.850
I will take a bat
to your hairy knees.

09:11.852 --> 09:14.052
Mm! Lord help
these children today.

09:14.054 --> 09:17.022
No, I was just wondering
if you would make my wedding

09:17.024 --> 09:19.157
more beautiful
by being a bridesmaid.

09:19.159 --> 09:21.393
Oh, Miss Cookie,
I would love to!

09:21.395 --> 09:24.863
(whispers):
You can touch one.

09:26.532 --> 09:27.232
You know, Cookie,

09:27.234 --> 09:28.533
I know we've had
our differences,

09:28.535 --> 09:30.468
but if there's
anything I can do

09:30.470 --> 09:31.436
to help you...

09:31.438 --> 09:33.038
You <i>can</i> try to make me
some coffee

09:33.040 --> 09:36.041
that doesn't taste
like a fart in the face.

09:37.276 --> 09:39.511
So tomorrow's
your wedding night,

09:39.513 --> 09:41.580
and you know
what that means.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.281
Yes, I do.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.416
What does it mean?

09:44.418 --> 09:45.517
(laughs)

09:45.519 --> 09:47.919
And what have
you boys been up to?

09:47.921 --> 09:49.287
Just talking
to black Stewie here.

09:49.289 --> 09:51.856
How about being our ring boy
on Saturday?

09:51.858 --> 09:52.524
Honored. All right, Dad,

09:52.526 --> 09:55.527
I'm gonna go practice my strut
down the aisle.

09:55.529 --> 09:56.161
Check this.

09:56.163 --> 09:59.931
Oh, yeah, a little something
like that right there.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.099
Mm-hmm.

10:01.101 --> 10:02.133
So the only thing left

10:02.135 --> 10:03.568
for you to do
is ask Cleveland

10:03.570 --> 10:04.803
to be your best man.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.504
Puh! Now, why
would I do that?

10:06.506 --> 10:08.673
Do it for me, LeVar.

10:08.675 --> 10:11.309
And after all,
he <i>is</i> your only son.

10:11.311 --> 10:14.279
(bell chiming punctuating
scene changes)

10:19.518 --> 10:23.221
(bell chiming faster)

10:25.124 --> 10:27.859
(tiger growls, birds tweeting)

10:27.861 --> 10:31.396
(bell chiming rapidly)

10:32.331 --> 10:36.234
Yeah, he is my only son.

10:37.903 --> 10:42.574
You might just be
the blackest fellow I ever met.

10:42.576 --> 10:43.608
"Freight Train." Cool name.

10:43.610 --> 10:44.676
How'd you get it?

10:44.678 --> 10:47.479
I destroyed your mama
on a train track.

10:48.180 --> 10:49.347
Okay, who's up

10:49.349 --> 10:52.117
for some beer pong?

10:52.119 --> 10:53.585
So, getting
married, huh?

10:53.587 --> 10:54.653
That's neat.

10:54.655 --> 10:57.622
Yeah. Well, you know,
usually at a wedding,

10:57.624 --> 10:58.523
there's a best man,

10:58.525 --> 11:01.626
and since you're my son and all,

11:01.628 --> 11:03.261
I was wondering...

11:03.263 --> 11:04.329
Oh, my God!

11:04.331 --> 11:06.431
Are you asking me
to be your best man?

11:06.433 --> 11:07.499
Well, not if you're gonna be

11:07.501 --> 11:08.733
a crying little
piss-pants about it.

11:08.735 --> 11:11.636
I'm crying because
I peed my pants.

11:11.638 --> 11:13.872
Oh, and it's on the chair!

11:13.874 --> 11:16.341
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

11:18.110 --> 11:21.913
My dad asked me
to be his B.M.
What?

11:21.915 --> 11:22.681
His best man.

11:22.683 --> 11:24.249
Get it?
(chuckles)

11:24.251 --> 11:25.350
Yes, I do. Cleveland,

11:25.352 --> 11:27.552
and I'm very
happy for you.

11:27.554 --> 11:28.186
(sighs)

11:28.188 --> 11:30.255
I wish I could get a little
respect from your mother.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.425
I've done everything I can think
of to get her to like me,

11:33.427 --> 11:35.527
but she just won't
give me a chance.

11:35.529 --> 11:38.163
I'll be honest:
it's hurtful, Cleveland.

11:38.165 --> 11:40.632
Ha! Women and
their problems.

11:40.634 --> 11:41.966
Speaking of women
with problems,

11:41.968 --> 11:47.038
I got to call that strip club
about the bachelor party. Mm...

11:50.476 --> 11:53.044
(techno-pop playing)

11:56.082 --> 11:59.184
Yeah!
Yeah, that's right.

12:01.987 --> 12:04.022
Great seeing
you, sis.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.123
Call Mom.

12:05.125 --> 12:07.025
She worries.

12:08.127 --> 12:10.361
Hey, Dad, what do you
say we take a break

12:10.363 --> 12:12.630
from borderline cheating
on our ladies

12:12.632 --> 12:14.899
and hit the gross
nacho bar.

12:14.901 --> 12:16.401
Sounds like a plan.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.368
We're bonding!

12:17.370 --> 12:19.337
Hey, Doughboy,
what you doin' here?

12:19.339 --> 12:23.108
They don't got men
dancing here. (laughs)

12:23.110 --> 12:24.209
(laughing)

12:24.211 --> 12:28.546
Mm. Dad, this is Donna's
ex-husband, Robert.

12:28.548 --> 12:31.282
Robert, my dad,
Freight Train.

12:31.284 --> 12:32.350
Damn, that's
a good grip.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.453
See, Cleveland, that's how
you shake a man's hand.

12:35.455 --> 12:36.554
(slap)
(gasps)

12:36.556 --> 12:38.890
And that's how you
shake a loose can.

12:38.892 --> 12:40.725
(both laughing)

12:40.727 --> 12:43.561
Where you been
hiding this one at?

12:43.563 --> 12:45.296
He's hilarious.

12:45.298 --> 12:48.500
Hey, I got two-for-one coupons
for the champagne room.

12:48.502 --> 12:50.602
What do you say we pick
one of these ladies

12:50.604 --> 12:53.271
and make her regret
coming to work tonight?

12:53.273 --> 12:54.639
(both laughing)

12:54.641 --> 12:55.707
I like how you think.

12:55.709 --> 12:58.176
Catch you later, Doughboy.

13:01.247 --> 13:03.581
Why are you sitting
all by yourself?

13:03.583 --> 13:06.718
Strip clubs aren't ideal
for a guy like me

13:06.720 --> 13:09.754
who doesn't, um,
wear pants.

13:09.756 --> 13:10.855
Where's your dad?

13:10.857 --> 13:13.091
With Robert,
disrespecting
some poor girl

13:13.093 --> 13:15.794
who's probably just
a struggling college student

13:15.796 --> 13:17.862
who works here for
the tuition money

13:17.864 --> 13:20.598
and not at all because
she was molested.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.567
Oh, I guess I should
just be grateful

13:22.569 --> 13:23.802
we're finally
getting along.

13:23.804 --> 13:26.638
The father-son relationship
is tricky.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.473
My dad and I didn't talk
for years

13:28.475 --> 13:30.775
after I stole Arianna
away from him.

13:30.777 --> 13:31.609
What?! You did?!

13:31.611 --> 13:34.579
(sighs) I've told you
that story, like, six times.

13:34.581 --> 13:37.816
You know, you don't,
you don't listen too good.
You really should...

13:37.818 --> 13:40.151
Hey, look,
my dad's back.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.553
(laughing)
Oh, man.

13:41.555 --> 13:43.688
Ha, ha, ha, why
are we laughing?

13:43.690 --> 13:44.789
What's the joke?

13:44.791 --> 13:46.291
You're the joke.

13:46.293 --> 13:46.925
I'm out.

13:46.927 --> 13:48.560
See you tomorrow.
1:00.

13:48.562 --> 13:50.795
You-you invited Robert
to the wedding?

13:50.797 --> 13:52.530
He did one more
than that.

13:52.532 --> 13:55.200
Your dad asked me
to be his best man.

13:55.202 --> 13:55.700
What?!

13:55.702 --> 13:57.502
But I'm your best man.

13:57.504 --> 13:59.504
How could he do this to me?

13:59.506 --> 14:04.242
If it's any consolation,
you're the best man I know.

14:04.244 --> 14:05.210
Tim, uh...

14:05.212 --> 14:06.978
No, no, it's okay.
No, it's okay.

14:06.980 --> 14:08.646
Cleveland, come
here, buddy.

14:08.648 --> 14:11.249
Uh, uh, uh,
uh. Oh.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.722
(playing classical music)

14:17.724 --> 14:20.925
A bunch of people here
think I'm a dentist,

14:20.927 --> 14:24.062
so if it comes up,
play it cool.
(giggling)

14:24.064 --> 14:26.264
Stupid, dumb wedding!

14:26.266 --> 14:27.065
Where's Grandpa?

14:27.067 --> 14:30.568
The wedding's supposed
to start any minute,
and no one's seen him.

14:30.570 --> 14:31.936
I don't know where he is.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.738
Why don't you ask
his best man.

14:33.740 --> 14:35.440
Well, he's not
here either.

14:35.442 --> 14:37.008
And they'd better
show up soon.

14:37.010 --> 14:38.343
That Mickey Rourke
ice sculpture

14:38.345 --> 14:39.911
can't much more
of this heat.

14:39.913 --> 14:42.413
That's not an
ice sculpture.

14:44.116 --> 14:46.985
(sobbing)

14:50.389 --> 14:52.257
He's not coming, is he?

14:52.259 --> 14:54.759
No, Cleveland,
I don't think he is.

14:54.761 --> 14:56.261
I'm sorry, Mom.

14:56.263 --> 14:58.863
Dad always treated
you so terribly.

14:58.865 --> 15:00.331
He never deserved you.

15:00.333 --> 15:01.232
He's a son of a bitch.

15:01.234 --> 15:05.136
Oh, Cleveland, you don't know
your father as well as I do.

15:05.138 --> 15:08.172
Whenever I needed something
fixed around the house,

15:08.174 --> 15:08.940
he'd be there.

15:08.942 --> 15:12.744
And when I was feeling low,
he'd fry some fish for me.

15:12.746 --> 15:15.380
And well, I know you're my son,
but, my word,

15:15.382 --> 15:20.351
that man can tag it, bag it,
and sell it to the butcher. Mm!

15:20.353 --> 15:20.952
Okay.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.921
We've been having booty calls
for years.

15:22.923 --> 15:25.790
So I finally said, "LeVar, if
you want to keep hitting this,

15:25.792 --> 15:27.759
you'd better put a ring on it."

15:27.761 --> 15:28.660
Please stop talking.

15:28.662 --> 15:31.462
(voice breaking):
I love your father, Cleveland,

15:31.464 --> 15:35.633
but I guess he just doesn't feel
the same way about me.

15:35.635 --> 15:36.334
Where you going?

15:36.336 --> 15:39.137
I'm taking the 4:15
back to Petersburg.

15:39.139 --> 15:41.873
There's too many
painful memories here.

15:41.875 --> 15:43.441
I'm so sick of this!

15:43.443 --> 15:46.411
We've been taking crap
from Dad our whole lives

15:46.413 --> 15:47.578
and I've never
said a word!

15:47.580 --> 15:50.848
I'm going to find him and
give him a piece of my mind.

15:50.850 --> 15:53.017
Stay away from his grits,
Cleveland.

15:53.019 --> 15:55.920
A woman needs
what a woman needs.

15:55.922 --> 15:58.289
(groans)

16:02.761 --> 16:04.829
Show time.

16:07.533 --> 16:08.299
Wake up!

16:08.301 --> 16:09.334
What the hell you
think you're doing?

16:09.336 --> 16:13.705
You left Mom at the altar, and
I'm going to make you regret it.

16:13.707 --> 16:15.340
You think you're ready?

16:15.342 --> 16:16.341
Damn right.

16:16.343 --> 16:18.343
Then let's dance, chubby.

16:18.345 --> 16:19.911
(yelling)

16:19.913 --> 16:21.646
(grunting)

16:23.148 --> 16:24.315
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

16:24.317 --> 16:27.585
Oh, I hate that.
Stop it! Stop it!

16:27.587 --> 16:28.119
Fine.

16:28.121 --> 16:30.955
You know, Dad, you might
be bigger than me

16:30.957 --> 16:32.390
and stronger than me,

16:32.392 --> 16:35.360
but I'm more of a man
than you'll ever be.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.260
How you figure?

16:36.262 --> 16:37.795
Because you're a coward.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.331
You're afraid to go
all in with Mom,

16:40.333 --> 16:42.567
because if you ever
let your guard down

16:42.569 --> 16:44.602
and show her
who you really are,

16:44.604 --> 16:46.771
she might not like
what she sees.

16:46.773 --> 16:49.974
And then you'd be
the one getting hurt.

16:49.976 --> 16:51.876
You're right, Cleveland.

16:51.878 --> 16:52.844
I am afraid.

16:52.846 --> 16:53.878
Your mama's a good woman.

16:53.880 --> 16:57.749
What if I'm a worse husband
to her than I was the last time?

16:57.751 --> 16:59.217
Isn't possible.

16:59.219 --> 17:00.018
(chuckles)

17:00.020 --> 17:01.986
All right, but if
she don't take me back,

17:01.988 --> 17:03.855
I'm gonna make
you my wife.

17:03.857 --> 17:06.824
And you shall
be my husband.

17:08.260 --> 17:11.496
Mom's gonna catch
a bus in 15 minutes.

17:11.498 --> 17:12.296
Oh, hell no.

17:12.298 --> 17:13.998
She gonna be riding
on the Freight Train.

17:14.000 --> 17:14.966
I'm gonna tear
your mama up.

17:14.968 --> 17:19.270
What's up with you and Mom
talking to your child that way?

17:19.272 --> 17:20.805
Both of you.

17:20.807 --> 17:22.040
(engine starting)

17:22.042 --> 17:23.775
(tires squealing)

17:28.514 --> 17:29.914
Why is everyone
still here?

17:29.916 --> 17:32.050
The wedding was supposed
to be hours ago.

17:32.052 --> 17:33.151
You're right,
Cleveland.

17:33.153 --> 17:35.420
We're invited to lots
of weddings with an open bar

17:35.422 --> 17:37.989
and no one shooing us away
from the free shrimp.

17:37.991 --> 17:41.192
We're gonna leave just 'cause
the groom don't show up!

17:41.194 --> 17:42.260
(all laughing)

17:42.262 --> 17:44.395
Yeah, that's
who we are.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.530
(all laughing)

17:45.532 --> 17:46.998
Cookie, listen...

17:47.000 --> 17:48.566
No, LeVar, you listen.

17:48.568 --> 17:51.436
If you don't care enough
to be on time for our wedding,

17:51.438 --> 17:54.505
then you don't deserve
to be my husband.

17:56.275 --> 17:56.941
Mom, wait.

17:56.943 --> 18:00.978
We all know Freight Train sucks,
but he loves you,

18:00.980 --> 18:03.381
and he wants to grow old
with you.

18:03.383 --> 18:05.383
And there's something
very important

18:05.385 --> 18:07.852
he wants to say to you.

18:07.854 --> 18:09.454
Cookie, I'm sorry.

18:09.456 --> 18:15.493
LeVar, in 41 years,
you've never apologized
to me for anything.

18:15.495 --> 18:18.262
Never did anything
wrong up to now.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.630
(both laughing)

18:19.632 --> 18:21.866
Looks like we're
getting married.

18:21.868 --> 18:22.500
(cheering)

18:22.502 --> 18:24.902
But I don't need this
big fancy wedding.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.871
Let's just go
down to city hall.

18:26.873 --> 18:28.473
CLEVELAND JR.:
The hell you will.

18:28.475 --> 18:30.908
You are getting married
here today.

18:30.910 --> 18:33.111
Now everybody get your ass
in the backyard

18:33.113 --> 18:35.313
before I turn this
into a funeral.

18:35.315 --> 18:37.014
(backup warning beeps)

18:37.016 --> 18:39.417
Nice work, tubby.

18:39.419 --> 18:40.451
I was wondering--

18:40.453 --> 18:42.687
how'd you like to be
my best man again?

18:42.689 --> 18:43.888
I appreciate you asking,

18:43.890 --> 18:48.926
but I've been asked to play
a more important role
in this wedding.

18:48.928 --> 18:52.463
("Wedding March" playing)

19:00.439 --> 19:01.939
Ugh.

19:01.941 --> 19:03.107
Oh, no...

19:03.109 --> 19:03.875
Ugh.

19:03.877 --> 19:05.476
I'm not gonna make it.

19:05.478 --> 19:07.512
