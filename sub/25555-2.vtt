08:10.857 --> 08:12.758
Codi has to understand
if somebody don't like you,

08:12.825 --> 08:14.827
they just don't like you.
Keep it moving.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.830
You have six other people
in the house that do like you.

08:17.897 --> 08:22.268
What the (bleep) is wrong?
What did you do to Codi?

08:22.335 --> 08:23.436
{\an1}I told him
to shut the (bleep) up

08:23.502 --> 08:25.304
because I was trying
to calm down Kortni,

08:25.371 --> 08:26.906
{\an1}and he apparently
took it the wrong way.

08:26.973 --> 08:29.075
{\an5}What happened? I was
already here, so I don't
know what happened.

08:29.141 --> 08:30.409
All I know is,
somebody better

08:30.476 --> 08:32.044
make me something to eat,
'cause I'm hungry.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.347
{\an5}Codi, come here.

08:32.111 --> 08:34.347
{\an3}Yes.

08:34.413 --> 08:36.849
What happened? Why are
you so mad about Jeremiah?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.417
I'm not. I don't
give a (bleep).

08:38.484 --> 08:39.552
{\an1}Shocker.

08:39.619 --> 08:42.520
{\an5}Who gives a (bleep),
man?

08:39.619 --> 08:42.520
{\an1}I don't.

08:42.587 --> 08:46.726
{\an5}(Nilsa)
I don't think Codi and
Jeremiah will ever get along,

08:46.792 --> 08:48.094
'cause it's the first day
in the house

08:48.160 --> 08:49.996
and (bleep)
is already going down.

08:50.062 --> 08:52.665
Come on, guys.
Let's pace ourselves.

08:52.732 --> 08:54.867
Piece of (bleep) ass
mother(bleep).

08:54.934 --> 08:56.235
(laughs)

08:56.302 --> 08:58.671
(bleep) that
mother(bleep).

08:58.738 --> 09:02.475
Somebody say I won't
beat his (bleep) ass.

09:02.541 --> 09:04.710
Son of a bitch, tell him
to (bleep) with me.

09:04.777 --> 09:05.945
Who are you fighting with?

09:06.012 --> 09:07.747
{\an1}I'm not fighting
with nobody.

09:07.813 --> 09:09.315
Dude! Bro! I'm naked
in here, bro!

09:09.382 --> 09:12.485
{\an4}I'll tear this--
I'll tear this mother down.

09:09.382 --> 09:12.485
Hi.

09:12.551 --> 09:14.754
Oh, (bleep).

09:14.820 --> 09:16.222
{\an1}How the (bleep)
did you get here?

09:16.289 --> 09:19.825
{\an5}I'm here. Hi.

09:16.289 --> 09:19.825
{\an1}Hi.

09:19.892 --> 09:21.494
I was nervous
because she's so small,

09:21.560 --> 09:23.663
I thought I done broke her.

09:23.729 --> 09:25.865
I thought I done squashed her
like a pancake.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.302
(laughter)

09:29.368 --> 09:33.072
Gus gonna say,
"no two pumps and a dump"?

09:33.139 --> 09:34.740
He's an all nighter.

09:34.807 --> 09:38.945
Gus gushy-goo!
You go, Gus!

09:39.011 --> 09:41.380
You go, Gus!

09:39.011 --> 09:41.380
{\an3}Hey, Gus,

09:41.447 --> 09:46.519
{\an5}go say no two pumps
and a dump, huh?

09:41.447 --> 09:46.519
{\an1}Go, Gus!

09:46.585 --> 09:47.820
What's going on?

09:47.887 --> 09:49.455
(laughter)

09:49.522 --> 09:51.824
Y'all want some snacks?

09:51.891 --> 09:53.192
(laughter)

09:53.259 --> 09:54.493
What's the (bleep) up?

09:54.560 --> 09:57.296
{\an8}You'll find that guys
can't (bleep) in peace,

09:57.363 --> 09:58.364
but girls can.

09:58.431 --> 09:59.765
(Aimee)
Well, you know what?

09:59.832 --> 10:02.368
I've seen him (bleep) a long
time ago, and you know what?

10:02.435 --> 10:04.603
I just walked downstairs
peacefully,

10:04.670 --> 10:06.639
'cause I'm a good person
with a good heart.

10:06.706 --> 10:08.541
Proud sister moment!

10:08.607 --> 10:11.944
Gus is not two pumps
and a dump.

10:12.011 --> 10:14.180
It's typical that the girls
are obviously, you know,

10:14.246 --> 10:16.649
trying to, like, ruin
what Gus is doing up there.

10:16.716 --> 10:18.918
You know,
let the man do his thing.

10:18.985 --> 10:21.687
{\an5}Oh, my God!
He's butt naked!

10:18.985 --> 10:21.687
That's all
(bleep) up.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.956
{\an5}She likes it.

10:21.754 --> 10:23.956
{\an5}(Gus)
Oh, come on.
Just leave me alone.

10:24.023 --> 10:26.759
Let me do my thing.
Y'all go down to the kitchen.

10:26.826 --> 10:28.794
Eat some pizza rolls,
eat some pizza, whatever.

10:28.861 --> 10:30.629
Just leave me alone.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.733
{\an5}Your life is crazy.

10:30.696 --> 10:33.733
Trust me, I know.

problem last night?

10:39.705 --> 10:41.273
{\an7}Are you gonna have a
conversation with Jeremiah?

10:41.340 --> 10:43.709
{\an8}You're not gonna come in this

{\an8}This conversation
is not getting anywhere.

22:41.393 --> 22:43.995
Codi's too drunk to be
confronting Jeremiah right now,

22:44.062 --> 22:45.597
and I'm too drunk
to listen to it.

22:45.664 --> 22:47.265

Anyway, I gotta pee.
Hold on, let me be right back.

22:47.332 --> 22:49.034
(Codi)
Let's go pee together.

22:49.101 --> 22:51.837

Let's go pee together.

Hey, here's where
Codi's coming from.

He thinks you don't
have his back

22:56.975 --> 22:58.210
but you have
everyone else's.

{\an1}I tried to console Codi
after his granddad passed.

23:00.645 --> 23:03.381
{\an1}Right now, we're here
for Codi in this situation

23:03.448 --> 23:05.784
{\an1}and we want to make sure that
he gets through this all right.

23:05.851 --> 23:09.354

just to look like a good guy.

There has been so many counts

23:11.223 --> 23:13.358

to connect with Codi.

23:13.425 --> 23:15.026
He has literally
slandered my name

23:15.093 --> 23:16.795
when it comes to protecting
people in the house

23:16.862 --> 23:18.396
and it's frankly bull(bleep).

23:18.463 --> 23:19.564
All right, you go do
your thing.

the same way as you,

{\an1}just for whatever reason,
I don't know.

23:27.706 --> 23:30.008
He's never came at me like
the way he's came at you.

23:30.075 --> 23:31.143
{\an1}I just wanted to
make sure we were good

23:31.209 --> 23:32.344

hear that (bleep).

23:32.410 --> 23:33.478

38:22.266 --> 38:23.601
Better start!

38:23.668 --> 38:27.505
Get that sexual tension out,
just let whatever be be.

38:27.571 --> 38:30.074
{\an1}This is gonna be
an interesting summer.

38:31.308 --> 38:33.044
{\an1}Listen to me, though.
If you even see me

38:33.110 --> 38:34.478
{\an1}try to go down
that road at all,

38:34.545 --> 38:35.913
{\an1}you cut it off
right then and there.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.481
{\an1}Snatch me by the hair
if you got to.

38:37.548 --> 38:39.383
Facts. So, I mean, you don't
want to (bleep) let me sleep.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.519
I can already see Nilsa
in the corner,

38:41.585 --> 38:43.654
sipping her drink,
looking at Gus talk to girls,

38:43.721 --> 38:47.158
like, just jealous as (bleep).
So don't do it.

38:47.224 --> 38:48.292
Like, it's that simple.

38:48.359 --> 38:49.960
{\an3}Deals?

38:51.262 --> 38:52.530
{\an7}(Codi)
You want some ribs?

38:52.596 --> 38:55.166
{\an5}(Gus)
I never thought
I'd see this day,

38:55.232 --> 38:57.501
but, I mean, when it's
completely thrown at you

38:57.568 --> 38:59.203
and you've got this pretty girl
sitting on your lap

38:59.270 --> 39:01.238
and you've got a little bit of
liquor in your system,

39:01.305 --> 39:02.740
it's kind of hard to say no

39:02.807 --> 39:04.375
to a little smooching action,
you know?

39:04.442 --> 39:07.311
Even if it is Nilsa and we do
have the history that we have.

39:07.378 --> 39:09.580
{\an1}Dude, let's go outside
and eat those.

39:09.647 --> 39:13.451
{\an5}Agreed. We gotta go now.

39:09.647 --> 39:13.451
{\an1}Yeah?

39:13.517 --> 39:16.153
I right now know that Nilsa's
interested in Gus.

39:16.220 --> 39:18.022
Now I want to have
a conversation with Gus

39:18.089 --> 39:19.757
to find out,
are you interested

39:19.824 --> 39:21.492
or are you not, brother?

39:21.559 --> 39:23.227
{\an4}So...

39:21.559 --> 39:23.227
I don't know
where to start, dude.

39:23.294 --> 39:25.563
{\an1}I heard that Nilsa
made out with you, bro.

39:25.629 --> 39:26.831
It wasn't a makeout.

39:26.897 --> 39:28.132
I sat there
while she kissed me.

39:28.199 --> 39:31.602
But you weren't mad about it.

39:31.669 --> 39:33.037
If you puckered back, bro,

39:33.104 --> 39:35.039
{\an1}you know that you
actually wanted it.

39:35.106 --> 39:36.540
So, like, for instance,

39:36.607 --> 39:38.609
if she decided to
hunch you tonight,

39:38.676 --> 39:42.646
{\an1}and she said, I'm cool with you
not wanting a relationship,

39:42.713 --> 39:44.181
{\an1}would you hunch
or would you not hunch?

39:44.248 --> 39:47.752
Prob... Maybe.

39:44.248 --> 39:47.752
{\an1}You would.

39:47.818 --> 39:49.987
If there's no worry
about drama, yeah.

39:50.054 --> 39:52.056
I mean, I'm a dude.
She's a good looking girl.

39:52.123 --> 39:53.657
Like, from a looks--
as far...

39:53.724 --> 39:55.993
I mean, she's been sweet
since we've got here.

39:56.060 --> 39:58.329
Like, she's not acting the
same as she was last time.

39:58.395 --> 39:59.630
I was attracted to her
from the start.

39:59.697 --> 40:01.098
It's not a secret.

40:01.165 --> 40:05.536
{\an1}It's just very, very
dangerous to go down that road.
