00:56.435 --> 00:58.782
Thank you for inviting me.

00:58.782 --> 01:01.440
In-vi-ting me.
Why does that sound weird?

01:01.440 --> 01:05.651
Thank you for "in-vi-ting" me.

01:05.651 --> 01:07.067
I'm screwed.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.068
Don't worry
about that, Miranda.

01:08.068 --> 01:09.586
I'll take care of it.

01:09.586 --> 01:10.760
Right. Yes, yes.

01:10.760 --> 01:12.072
I'll see you soon.

01:17.284 --> 01:18.250
Hey.
- Hey.

01:18.250 --> 01:19.527
Thank you for staying.

01:19.527 --> 01:22.703
It was good
to feel safe with you.

01:22.703 --> 01:25.430
Yeah, it was--
it was good, wasn't it?

01:25.430 --> 01:27.984
Yeah.

01:27.984 --> 01:31.953
Uh, so we slept
in the same room last night.

01:31.953 --> 01:33.921
It was nice,
but we shouldn't let it be

01:33.921 --> 01:35.681
something more than that.

01:35.681 --> 01:37.304
Of course. Of course.

01:37.304 --> 01:39.271
We were just sleeping
in the same room.

01:39.271 --> 01:41.101
Thank you for understanding.

01:43.241 --> 01:46.485
Carina,
should we do this again?

01:46.485 --> 01:49.695
Uh, is it okay
if we talk later,

01:49.695 --> 01:50.938
see how the day goes?

01:50.938 --> 01:54.286
Later. Yes. Great.

01:54.286 --> 01:55.563
- Okay.
- Bye.

02:01.914 --> 02:04.124
Oh, come on now. No.
That is not what I'm saying.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.884
The clinic is important,
all right?

02:05.884 --> 02:07.127
Your work is important.

02:07.127 --> 02:08.921
But you poked the bear, Miranda.

02:08.921 --> 02:10.337
What, do you want me
to back down?

02:10.337 --> 02:12.201
I don't want you to get hurt,
or worse.

02:12.201 --> 02:15.480
The bigger picture is
your safety, the kids' safety.

02:15.480 --> 02:18.828
Wait, you think I don't see
the bigger picture?

02:18.828 --> 02:20.830
An entire group of people

02:20.830 --> 02:23.143
have just lost their rights
in this country.

02:23.143 --> 02:24.834
You, me, the kids.

02:24.834 --> 02:26.180
You may not feel it, Ben,

02:26.180 --> 02:27.906
but while we are
an important picture,

02:27.906 --> 02:29.908
we are the smaller picture.

02:29.908 --> 02:31.427
Okay, okay, well, as someone

02:31.427 --> 02:34.050
who is in that smaller picture
with you,

02:34.050 --> 02:37.433
could you at least please take
steps to protect yourself?

02:37.433 --> 02:39.020
Okay, well,
what does that look like?

02:42.679 --> 02:44.267
It's mace.

02:44.267 --> 02:45.717
Ben Warren,
you know I'll just end up

02:45.717 --> 02:46.683
spraying myself with that.

02:46.683 --> 02:48.375
Come in.

02:48.375 --> 02:49.997
Hi. Hi--

02:49.997 --> 02:52.379
Uh, he took a personal day

02:52.379 --> 02:54.967
to try to convince me
to arm myself.

02:54.967 --> 02:56.728
Did you get the stuff?
- I got the stuff.

02:56.728 --> 02:57.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa, okay.

02:57.798 --> 02:59.800
You--you two are
up to something.

02:59.800 --> 03:02.561
Okay, there--there are tones.
- Tones?

03:02.561 --> 03:04.529
Okay, see, Miranda,
this is what I'm talking about.

03:04.529 --> 03:07.704
Just tell me what's going--
tell me what's going on.

03:07.704 --> 03:09.706
- Um...
- Okay.

03:09.706 --> 03:11.191
See, you two look like

03:11.191 --> 03:12.226
you're about to get
into some trouble.

03:12.226 --> 03:14.573
No, we're not
getting into trouble.

03:14.573 --> 03:17.473
I'm gonna cause trouble.

03:17.473 --> 03:19.371
Bye.

03:24.652 --> 03:26.723
Oh, no.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.415
No, no, no.

03:28.415 --> 03:29.933
I thought we said
no first-day shenanigans.

03:29.933 --> 03:31.383
It's just a little
light razzing.

03:31.383 --> 03:33.661
Yeah, and razzing
the new captain is tradition.

03:33.661 --> 03:35.249
If we don't do it,
who knows what could happen?

03:35.249 --> 03:36.906
We didn't razz Beckett.

03:36.906 --> 03:39.080
Thank you, Travis,
bringer of darkness.

03:40.427 --> 03:42.567
- Oh, what happened?
- You guys.

03:42.567 --> 03:44.845
- Okay, okay. You got me.
- It's not that funny.

03:44.845 --> 03:46.260
It's his first day.

03:46.260 --> 03:49.263
Shh, shh, shh.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.885
Very funny, gang.

03:50.885 --> 03:52.577
All right. Let's line up.

03:55.718 --> 03:58.410
Hello. Line up.

04:06.625 --> 04:09.110
Ah, all right. Yeah.
- Yeah.

04:09.110 --> 04:11.596
The jokes keep coming, right?
All right.

04:11.596 --> 04:13.080
That's the last one.
That's the last one.

04:13.080 --> 04:14.771
That's the best one.

04:14.771 --> 04:16.601
All right, all right.
Get it all out of your system.

04:16.601 --> 04:18.844
Last one.
That was--that was fun.

04:18.844 --> 04:21.295
So, 19,

04:21.295 --> 04:23.435
morning.

04:23.435 --> 04:24.988
You all know my feelings

04:24.988 --> 04:27.301
about how Captain Beckett
ran this house.

04:27.301 --> 04:29.993
I'm gonna be running things
a little different.

04:29.993 --> 04:33.376
I really want us to talk more,
have better communication.

04:33.376 --> 04:34.998
The better informed I am,

04:34.998 --> 04:36.310
the better I can lead
this team.

04:36.310 --> 04:39.624
So let's keep those comms
open and frequent.

04:39.624 --> 04:43.559
Also, I am not going to be
hiding behind my tablet.

04:43.559 --> 04:46.113
I'm gonna be in it with
all of you as much as I can.

04:46.113 --> 04:47.494
All right?

04:47.494 --> 04:50.738
Let's do it. 19.
all: 19!

04:50.738 --> 04:52.809
Oh. I almost forgot.
Fresh bagels in the Beanery.

04:52.809 --> 04:53.879
- Oh!
- Nice.

04:53.879 --> 04:55.950
Oh!

04:55.950 --> 04:58.298
Oh, baby.

04:59.782 --> 05:01.956
No bagel for you?

05:01.956 --> 05:03.820
I don't eat bagels.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.719
Yeah, I know.
That was a joke.

05:07.099 --> 05:08.515
Now, if something's going on--

05:08.515 --> 05:11.414
I'm just--I'm just trying
to finish up here.

05:11.414 --> 05:13.347
That's all.

05:13.347 --> 05:14.831
Okay.

05:21.942 --> 05:24.151
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:24.151 --> 05:26.533
How's it feel?

05:26.533 --> 05:28.673
It feels good.

05:28.673 --> 05:31.020
Yeah, I've learned a lot
since last time I was captain.

05:31.020 --> 05:32.159
Grown a lot.

05:32.159 --> 05:33.574
That's because of Vic

05:33.574 --> 05:36.128
and you.

05:36.128 --> 05:37.267
I'ma get it right
this time, man.

05:37.267 --> 05:38.924
I know you are.

05:38.924 --> 05:40.443
And listen,

05:40.443 --> 05:42.272
even though I'm not gonna be
out there with you

05:42.272 --> 05:43.895
on your first day,
you're gonna be great.

05:43.895 --> 05:45.621
What do you mean you're not
going to be out there?

05:45.621 --> 05:47.243
Well, 'cause the town hall
thing, the debate thing.

05:47.243 --> 05:48.693
Oh, yeah.
It's not on my calendar, so...

05:48.693 --> 05:49.970
What? No.

05:49.970 --> 05:51.178
I--I put the request in
weeks ago.

05:51.178 --> 05:52.869
I guess Beckett lost it.

05:52.869 --> 05:54.388
What? No. Oh, no.

05:54.388 --> 05:55.941
This is so bad, man.

05:55.941 --> 05:57.218
How am I gonna prep?

05:57.218 --> 05:58.461
I was gonna have
desk duty to memorize

05:58.461 --> 05:59.462
a bunch of the stuff.

05:59.462 --> 06:01.050
Eli's gonna kill me.

06:01.050 --> 06:03.880
Oh, you got jokes.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.744
Hey, you all got jokes.
I got jokes too.

06:05.744 --> 06:07.056
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

06:10.577 --> 06:11.819
That's the last one.

06:11.819 --> 06:13.649
Yeah, keep laughing.
Keep laughing.

06:13.649 --> 06:15.098
After you clean up
all this confetti,

06:15.098 --> 06:16.410
you're cleaning turnouts, Montgomery.

06:16.410 --> 06:17.584
Yeah.

06:17.584 --> 06:18.826
That's the last one?

06:18.826 --> 06:19.793
No. Not a joke.

06:19.793 --> 06:21.242
You're on desk,

06:21.242 --> 06:22.589
and the turnouts need
some love.

06:22.589 --> 06:24.073
I thought we were friends.

06:24.073 --> 06:26.075
That's--that's fair.

06:26.075 --> 06:29.181
<i>All units
to 2650 Greenwood Avenue.</i>

06:29.181 --> 06:30.390
Hey, you're gonna be
great tonight.

06:30.390 --> 06:31.908
Hoping we'll be able
to swing by.

06:31.908 --> 06:33.151
Yeah, you're gonna be great
out there, Captain.

06:33.151 --> 06:35.256
Kick some ass for Mikey.
- Hell yeah.

06:39.847 --> 06:41.504
That's the last one.

06:52.860 --> 06:55.449
Sullivan and Herrera,
you're on B side.

06:55.449 --> 06:57.417
Larsson and Wiggins, C side.

06:57.417 --> 06:59.695
Bishop and Cutler,
you're on D side.

06:59.695 --> 07:02.111
Hughes, Gibson,
see the cars in the driveway?

07:02.111 --> 07:05.286
Excuse me. I saw smoke.

07:05.286 --> 07:07.634
The boys are making
so much noise,

07:07.634 --> 07:10.637
sawing and drilling
all hours of the day and night.

07:10.637 --> 07:12.535
It's a disaster.
You need to stop them.

07:12.535 --> 07:15.124
Okay.
Where did you see the smoke?

07:15.124 --> 07:16.815
Thank you, ma'am.

07:16.815 --> 07:19.059
Hughes, Gibson, see if anyone's
inside and get more details.

07:19.059 --> 07:19.991
Take a med kit just in case.

07:19.991 --> 07:21.371
They're home, all right.

07:21.371 --> 07:22.614
I heard them yelling
this morning.

07:22.614 --> 07:24.098
All right, everyone know
what they're doing?

07:24.098 --> 07:25.479
Yes, sir.

07:25.479 --> 07:27.550
Those Neely boys
are gonna ruin

07:27.550 --> 07:29.966
the whole block.

07:29.966 --> 07:32.313
This should be fun.

07:32.313 --> 07:34.384
Hello? Hello?

07:34.384 --> 07:36.386
Hello?
Seattle FD, Seattle FD.

07:36.386 --> 07:38.181
Get out of my way!

07:38.181 --> 07:39.631
Watching YouTube doesn't
make you a contractor!

07:39.631 --> 07:41.081
- Yeah?
- No, no, no!

07:41.081 --> 07:42.151
Just because you're older
doesn't make you Dad.

07:42.151 --> 07:43.152
- You need to calm down.
- No!

07:43.152 --> 07:44.429
I'm going anywhere!

07:44.429 --> 07:46.189
Can you please
turn the music off, please?

07:46.189 --> 07:47.190
- All right, hey!
- Suit yourself!

07:47.190 --> 07:48.985
Hello. Whoa, whoa!

07:48.985 --> 07:50.331
- Whoa.
- Are you crazy?

07:50.331 --> 07:52.402
- Whoa. Whoa.
- If I was crazy,

07:52.402 --> 07:53.852
I wouldn't have
given you a warning.

07:53.852 --> 07:54.957
- Sir, please--
- Move!

07:54.957 --> 07:56.027
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:56.027 --> 07:57.511
Watch out!

07:57.511 --> 07:58.892
Whoa!
- Whoa, whoa!

07:58.892 --> 08:01.273
Okay.

08:01.273 --> 08:02.999
Bishop, Clyde,
I need an assist.

08:02.999 --> 08:04.691
- Please, put down the sledge--
- Please put down the--

08:04.691 --> 08:06.658
No, stop!

08:06.658 --> 08:07.694
Is there blood?

08:07.694 --> 08:09.696
It feels like there's blood.

08:09.696 --> 08:10.766
I got it, Captain.

08:10.766 --> 08:12.871
I'm calling the police.

08:12.871 --> 08:16.254
You Neely boys are going
straight to jail, you hear me?

08:16.254 --> 08:19.222
Straight to jail!

08:19.222 --> 08:21.052
Stop poking at me.
- Ma'am, ma'am.

08:21.052 --> 08:22.398
I need to take you
to the hospital

08:22.398 --> 08:23.882
so you can be evaluated
by an eye surgeon, okay?

08:23.882 --> 08:25.608
- What was that?
- Are you good, Captain?

08:25.608 --> 08:28.024
No. We're good.
Get back to B side.

08:28.024 --> 08:29.888
Bishop, Clyde, she needs
to go to the hospital.

08:29.888 --> 08:32.132
Get her to the aid car and go
back to inspect the D side.

08:32.132 --> 08:33.202
I'm worried
about the foundation.

08:33.202 --> 08:35.376
Uh, yes, sir.

08:35.376 --> 08:37.551
I'm sending
the Neely boys a bill.

08:37.551 --> 08:39.035
This whole place could
come down any second.

08:39.035 --> 08:40.312
Hughes, Gibson, status?

08:46.422 --> 08:48.562
Crisis Pregnancy Center.
May I help you?

08:48.562 --> 08:49.805
Yeah, no problem.

08:53.049 --> 08:55.086
You followed us here?

08:55.086 --> 08:57.157
Didn't really give me
much of a choice, now, did you?

08:57.157 --> 08:58.296
- No.
- What is this place?

08:58.296 --> 09:01.920
A crisis pregnancy center.

09:01.920 --> 09:04.233
It's almost got
the same name as your clinic.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.097
Yeah, that's how they trick
all these women

09:06.097 --> 09:08.237
into thinking they're providing
abortion care.

09:08.237 --> 09:10.342
Okay, okay, well, hurry up
and give out the cards

09:10.342 --> 09:11.723
to your clinic,
and let's get out of here.

09:11.723 --> 09:12.931
That's not the plan.

09:12.931 --> 09:14.381
- Okay. Well, what is the plan?
- Shh.

09:14.381 --> 09:15.900
- Do you even have a plan?
- Stop.

09:15.900 --> 09:17.246
You gals came all the way
down here without a plan?

09:17.246 --> 09:20.007
- Shh!
- Ben!

09:20.007 --> 09:21.906
Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry.

09:21.906 --> 09:25.737
This husband of mine,
always nag, nag, nag.

09:26.980 --> 09:28.775
Look.

09:28.775 --> 09:32.433
All we need to do is get them
to give medical advice,

09:32.433 --> 09:34.470
and then we can shut
this place down.

09:34.470 --> 09:36.610
Well, actually, no,
that's just a $1,000 fine.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.439
But it's a start.

09:38.439 --> 09:40.441
We need to know what
they're saying to the patients

09:40.441 --> 09:42.133
to better arm ourselves

09:42.133 --> 09:44.445
as we try
to get them shut down.

09:44.445 --> 09:45.515
Have you two
even thought this through?

09:45.515 --> 09:46.965
Look,
I think you need to leave.

09:46.965 --> 09:48.139
- I think you need a plan.
- I think that--

09:48.139 --> 09:49.589
Hi.

09:51.349 --> 09:53.938
Carina?
- Yeah. Carina DeLuca.

09:53.938 --> 09:56.112
And I'm Ben DeLuca.

09:56.112 --> 09:57.113
- Oh.
- Yeah.

09:57.113 --> 09:58.632
My wife and I

09:58.632 --> 10:01.152
and our
very supportive friend here

10:01.152 --> 10:04.638
would like to get some
information about an abortion.

10:04.638 --> 10:07.158
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Well, Right this way.

10:07.158 --> 10:08.608
- Oh, thank you.
- Oh, thanks. Darling.

10:08.608 --> 10:11.058
Friend.

10:11.058 --> 10:13.233
Not gonna be
friends for long.

10:13.233 --> 10:14.717
You have no idea
what you're doing!

10:14.717 --> 10:16.650
- Sullivan, you see this?
- You're so stupid!

10:16.650 --> 10:17.893
I know how to do this!

10:17.893 --> 10:19.273
Captain,
the foundation of this house

10:19.273 --> 10:20.999
is severely compromised.

10:20.999 --> 10:23.346
<i>Several large cracks,
at least 2 inches wide.</i>

10:23.346 --> 10:25.072
<i>We're seeing signs
of water erosion.</i>

10:25.072 --> 10:26.695
The house is clearly sliding.

10:26.695 --> 10:28.662
Same here, Captain.
I've never seen it this bad.

10:28.662 --> 10:31.182
Copy.
I'll double-check to be sure.

10:31.182 --> 10:32.735
<i>Just in case, Bishop,
turn off the water.</i>

10:32.735 --> 10:35.496
Sullivan and Herrera,
same for the gas and power.

10:35.496 --> 10:36.912
Well, I'm not a math major,

10:36.912 --> 10:39.190
but if I'm checking
and Bishop's checking,

10:39.190 --> 10:41.157
now Ruiz is
checking our checks,

10:41.157 --> 10:42.745
it's more like
quadruple-checking, right?

10:42.745 --> 10:44.367
New captain, new math.

10:44.367 --> 10:45.334
All right, all right,
all right!

10:45.334 --> 10:46.507
Are you trying to kill me?

10:46.507 --> 10:47.750
I told you
to get out of the way!

10:47.750 --> 10:49.510
Okay, stop. Hey, hey, hey.
We are with SFD,

10:49.510 --> 10:50.650
and we need you guys
to calm down.

10:50.650 --> 10:52.617
Hughes, Gibson,
you need to evac.

10:52.617 --> 10:55.171
The house is showing signs
of structural compromise.

10:55.171 --> 10:56.172
All right,
copy that, Captain.

10:56.172 --> 10:57.691
<i>It's chaos in here.</i>

10:57.691 --> 10:59.175
Okay, we need to get you guys
to come with us.

10:59.175 --> 11:00.383
- Did you call them?
- No.

11:00.383 --> 11:01.522
- I wish I had.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:01.522 --> 11:02.834
Listen, listen. Starting over.

11:02.834 --> 11:04.836
We are with SFD,

11:04.836 --> 11:06.838
and we need to get you
out to safety right now.

11:06.838 --> 11:08.219
<i>Hughes, Gibson, status.</i>

11:08.219 --> 11:09.841
This idiot's gonna
bring down the entire house.

11:09.841 --> 11:11.222
What do you want me
to do, Jim?

11:11.222 --> 11:12.706
- All right, I understand.
- I'm a grown-ass man!

11:12.706 --> 11:14.121
- All right, you need to--
- And I can do what I want.

11:14.121 --> 11:16.054
Stop, stop, stop!

11:16.054 --> 11:17.607
- No, no, stop!
- Whoa! Whoa!

11:17.607 --> 11:19.195
Stop! No, no, no!

11:19.195 --> 11:21.232
Make sure it's secured first.

11:21.232 --> 11:23.406
You know, Robel's got
an impressive pedigree.

11:23.406 --> 11:24.891
You know, he did his undergrad
at Yale

11:24.891 --> 11:26.237
but did his grad school
at U-Dub,

11:26.237 --> 11:28.239
so he's got Seattle cred.

11:28.239 --> 11:30.759
He's been on city council
for over a decade.

11:30.759 --> 11:32.899
I mean, there's no issue that
he's not already dealt with.

11:32.899 --> 11:35.556
In fact, he might--he might be
the most intelligent politician

11:35.556 --> 11:37.144
I've ever met.

11:37.144 --> 11:38.663
Sounds like you should be
working for him.

11:38.663 --> 11:40.907
Oh, no, I mean,
Robel's a brilliant policy guy,

11:40.907 --> 11:43.323
and, you know, he looks
the part, but he's dull.

11:43.323 --> 11:46.360
And he doesn't have a good
campaign manager like me

11:46.360 --> 11:48.052
to get him to inspire people.

11:48.052 --> 11:50.986
Once he starts talking tonight,
it'll be Snoozeburg.

11:52.815 --> 11:54.265
You look like you're--

11:54.265 --> 11:55.887
Overwhelmed? Intimidated?

11:55.887 --> 11:57.751
Thinking about ways
to get a Canadian passport?

11:57.751 --> 11:59.270
Okay. Yeah.

11:59.270 --> 12:00.443
I mean,
I'd be worried if you weren't

12:00.443 --> 12:01.997
absolutely terrified,
to be honest.

12:01.997 --> 12:04.413
Okay, well, great,
'cause nerves are high.

12:04.413 --> 12:06.380
- Right. Just breathe.
- Yeah.

12:06.380 --> 12:08.244
And, uh--and, uh--

12:08.244 --> 12:10.005
Seattle has seen
an increase in crime rates.

12:10.005 --> 12:11.661
As mayor, what will you do?

12:11.661 --> 12:15.355
We...

12:15.355 --> 12:18.530
have to remember
to separate out the felonies

12:18.530 --> 12:20.774
from the misdemeanors
in order to capture

12:20.774 --> 12:22.776
a more accurate picture.

12:26.642 --> 12:28.437
Once we've confirmed
that you're pregnant,

12:28.437 --> 12:30.473
we can discuss options.

12:30.473 --> 12:32.924
I don't need options.
I need an abortion.

12:32.924 --> 12:34.270
I understand, Mommy.

12:34.270 --> 12:36.410
It's a scary time.

12:36.410 --> 12:38.447
We have a lot to talk about.

12:41.622 --> 12:43.348
What?

12:43.348 --> 12:46.662
- Okay.
- Okay.

12:46.662 --> 12:48.146
Do you usually carry urine
in your pocket,

12:48.146 --> 12:49.285
or just on special days?

12:49.285 --> 12:50.631
Pregnant lady urine.

12:50.631 --> 12:52.702
Sheila from radiology
owed me a favor.

12:52.702 --> 12:54.049
You know this is insane?

12:54.049 --> 12:55.982
You are correct.

12:55.982 --> 12:57.707
This is insane!

12:57.707 --> 12:59.157
Look at this place.

12:59.157 --> 13:02.126
Designed to look like
an actual abortion clinic,

13:02.126 --> 13:03.334
but then once you're in here,

13:03.334 --> 13:04.818
they're playing politics
with health care.

13:04.818 --> 13:06.716
Abortion is
inherently political.

13:06.716 --> 13:08.304
What did you just say?

13:08.304 --> 13:09.823
You are
a health care professional.

13:09.823 --> 13:11.342
Oh, no, no.

13:11.342 --> 13:13.240
Okay, you--you know
what I meant, all right?

13:13.240 --> 13:15.346
I just meant
that in this political climate,

13:15.346 --> 13:16.796
you can't remove
the political part of it

13:16.796 --> 13:19.143
from any conversation,
which brings me back

13:19.143 --> 13:21.593
to my point from this morning:
your safety.

13:21.593 --> 13:23.319
It is naive of you to think
that you could do this--

13:23.319 --> 13:25.011
Naive?
Are you serious right now?

13:25.011 --> 13:26.184
Yes, I'm serious.
Very serious.

13:26.184 --> 13:27.703
You want to explain to me?
Mansplain?

13:27.703 --> 13:29.325
Obviously, I need to--
it's not mansplaining.

13:29.325 --> 13:30.499
Shh!

13:30.499 --> 13:32.363
Guys, whatever this is,

13:32.363 --> 13:34.158
it's not about your issues, okay?

13:34.158 --> 13:35.745
We're on a mission.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.851
You keep scoffing,
I swear to God.

13:37.851 --> 13:39.542
Hey, focus.

13:39.542 --> 13:41.199
All we need is for this woman
to come back

13:41.199 --> 13:42.718
and give us
actual medical advice

13:42.718 --> 13:45.514
so we can make some noise
and bring this to the city.

13:45.514 --> 13:46.653
What?
- Okay.

13:46.653 --> 13:48.689
How are we going to get her

13:48.689 --> 13:51.900
to give you medical advice
when she knows it's illegal?

13:51.900 --> 13:54.834
Look, if three doctors can't
figure out the right questions

13:54.834 --> 13:56.663
to get this woman
to give medical advice,

13:56.663 --> 13:58.216
then we're idiots.

13:58.216 --> 14:01.012
Not one word, Benjamin Warren.

14:02.531 --> 14:05.292
The responsibility

14:05.292 --> 14:07.363
for educating our children

14:07.363 --> 14:09.227
should fall between--

14:09.227 --> 14:12.230
should be divided
between the federal,

14:12.230 --> 14:14.854
the state, and the local.

14:14.854 --> 14:16.614
Nailed it, mostly.

14:16.614 --> 14:18.858
Okay.

14:18.858 --> 14:20.411
- "Okay" what?
- Okay.

14:20.411 --> 14:22.137
You're not gonna like this.

14:22.137 --> 14:25.657
What is it? Show it to me.

14:25.657 --> 14:28.488
<i>In Travis Montgomery's
Seattle, anything goes.</i>

14:28.488 --> 14:31.215
- No.
<i>- Drug addicts in the streets,</i>

14:31.215 --> 14:32.733
<i>cutting funds
to fight homelessness...</i>

14:32.733 --> 14:34.252
Oh, my God.

14:34.252 --> 14:35.426
<i>And threats
to abolish police</i>

14:35.426 --> 14:38.049
<i>and turn Seattle
into a war zone.</i>

14:38.049 --> 14:40.224
<i>And as a supporter of CHOP,</i>

14:40.224 --> 14:42.916
<i>Travis Montgomery cheered on
anarchy and lawlessness.</i>

14:42.916 --> 14:44.814
<i>Travis Montgomery,
the wrong choice for Seattle.</i>

14:44.814 --> 14:46.678
Okay, that's from
Emmett's birthday party.

14:46.678 --> 14:49.750
<i>I'm Michael Dixon,
and I approve this ad.</i>

14:49.750 --> 14:51.718
Is he allowed
to just do that?

14:51.718 --> 14:54.272
He is, yeah,
and he, uh--he did.

14:59.277 --> 15:01.245
Hughes, Gibson,
I don't see you out here.

15:01.245 --> 15:02.729
Update, please.

15:02.729 --> 15:04.282
The homeowners
are not cooperating.

15:04.282 --> 15:06.112
Okay, guys, guys,
these floors are unstable,

15:06.112 --> 15:08.114
and all of this is
making it worse, okay?

15:08.114 --> 15:09.943
If we don't leave now, this
could all come tumbling down

15:09.943 --> 15:11.186
and make the choice for us,
all right?

15:11.186 --> 15:12.118
- I'm finishing what I started.
- Okay.

15:12.118 --> 15:13.809
<i>Hughes, I need an update.</i>

15:13.809 --> 15:16.122
- Look, we are working on it!
- Mom wanted me to fix it.

15:16.122 --> 15:17.468
Fix it up?
You're destroying it!

15:17.468 --> 15:18.952
Whoa, whoa!

15:18.952 --> 15:21.127
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa!
- Hey. Hey!

15:21.127 --> 15:23.198
Hey. No, no, no, no!

15:23.198 --> 15:25.476
Hey! No, hey!

15:25.476 --> 15:27.857
Hey, this doesn't look good.

15:27.857 --> 15:29.135
This whole house is
gonna come down.

15:29.135 --> 15:30.619
Oh, no, no, no.

15:30.619 --> 15:31.965
Come on, come on. Stop.

15:31.965 --> 15:33.311
<i>Hughes.</i>

15:33.311 --> 15:34.795
I need an update.
I'm still not seeing you.

15:34.795 --> 15:36.314
- Hey!
- You know what, Captain?

15:36.314 --> 15:37.660
I need to focus, so I am
signing off, all right?

15:37.660 --> 15:38.972
- Look what you did!
- Guys. Hey.

15:38.972 --> 15:41.630
- Come on!
- Whoa.

15:45.875 --> 15:47.153
Ugh, that one hurt me.

15:47.153 --> 15:48.464
Hughes!

15:55.161 --> 15:57.646
Here we go.
The moment of truth.

15:57.646 --> 15:58.888
Go ahead, read it.

15:58.888 --> 16:00.304
Why don't you read it?

16:00.304 --> 16:03.583
Oh, no.

16:03.583 --> 16:06.310
This is
your exciting fortune cookie.

16:06.310 --> 16:08.070
You read the fortune.

16:08.070 --> 16:10.831
You are the health care
professional, right?

16:10.831 --> 16:13.386
We prefer
if the mom-to-be does it.

16:15.491 --> 16:16.492
Um...

16:19.012 --> 16:20.634
It's positive.

16:20.634 --> 16:22.982
Congratulations, Mommy!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.673
And Daddy.

16:24.673 --> 16:26.675
Friend.

16:26.675 --> 16:29.091
You're having a baby!

16:35.856 --> 16:37.617
Oh, I'm sorry.

16:37.617 --> 16:41.724
I knew I was pregnant,
but just hearing it out loud...

16:41.724 --> 16:43.761
I have some additional
material for you.

16:43.761 --> 16:45.625
- Mm-hmm.
- I'll be right back.

16:45.625 --> 16:47.178
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.
- Okay.

16:49.318 --> 16:50.699
She clearly knows
it's illegal for her

16:50.699 --> 16:52.218
to dispense
a medical diagnosis.

16:52.218 --> 16:53.943
I mean, fortune cookie?

16:53.943 --> 16:55.221
Are you kidding me with this?

16:55.221 --> 16:56.705
You okay?

16:58.534 --> 17:01.641
Mm-mm.

17:01.641 --> 17:04.885
My first
positive pregnancy test,

17:04.885 --> 17:06.715
and it isn't real.

17:15.689 --> 17:17.760
He didn't give any context.

17:17.760 --> 17:20.556
And what wasn't out of context
was just completely untrue.

17:20.556 --> 17:22.041
I mean, he photoshopped
one picture of me

17:22.041 --> 17:23.421
to make me look scary,
and the other one

17:23.421 --> 17:25.423
he just stole
from social media.

17:25.423 --> 17:26.873
We should sue him for that.
Can we sue him for that?

17:26.873 --> 17:28.323
The silver lining?

17:28.323 --> 17:29.945
This ad tells me they're
actually quite scared of you.

17:29.945 --> 17:31.843
Okay, you're talking about
politics, which is your job.

17:31.843 --> 17:33.224
I'm talking about
right and wrong.

17:33.224 --> 17:34.570
Right and wrong.

17:34.570 --> 17:36.883
That should matter.
Decency should matter.

17:36.883 --> 17:38.678
Character should matter.

17:38.678 --> 17:40.680
And what is your plan
to address the housing crisis?

17:42.440 --> 17:43.752
I know all these problems

17:43.752 --> 17:45.892
that we're talking about
tonight seem complicated.

17:45.892 --> 17:47.583
I mean, they are complicated.

17:47.583 --> 17:50.586
But fires are complicated.
Each one is different.

17:50.586 --> 17:52.105
How do you fight a fire?
What's the solution?

17:52.105 --> 17:53.624
It's actually not complicated.

17:53.624 --> 17:55.419
You just cut off
the oxygen supply,

17:55.419 --> 17:56.903
and that's it.

17:56.903 --> 17:59.354
The way I see it,
the housing crisis

17:59.354 --> 18:01.287
is a complicated problem,
but it has a simple solution.

18:01.287 --> 18:03.254
We need more housing.

18:03.254 --> 18:05.222
Ask me another one.
- Okay, I was totally wrong

18:05.222 --> 18:07.155
in trying to stuff your head
full of facts and figures.

18:07.155 --> 18:08.949
You just need to talk
like you're talking to me now.

18:08.949 --> 18:10.365
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:10.365 --> 18:11.642
It's kind of like
what I did on the radio.

18:11.642 --> 18:13.264
That seemed to work out
pretty good.

18:13.264 --> 18:14.955
I will need my cards, though.

18:14.955 --> 18:17.199
Those factoids are
pretty important.

18:17.199 --> 18:18.890
I like the facts.
- Let's do this.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.203
Honestly, combined with the--
whoa, whoa, whoa!

18:21.203 --> 18:22.446
Hey, what are you doing?

18:22.446 --> 18:24.137
Put it down!
Oh, my God, man!

18:24.137 --> 18:25.794
What are you doing, man?
My cards!

18:25.794 --> 18:28.141
You burned my cards!
In a firehouse!

18:28.141 --> 18:29.625
Well, technically,
it is the safest place

18:29.625 --> 18:31.144
to burn something.

18:31.144 --> 18:33.457
Travis, you don't need
the cards.

18:33.457 --> 18:36.736
Just be you.
Just have a conversation.

18:36.736 --> 18:38.876
- An angry conversation.
- Yes.

18:38.876 --> 18:40.326
Let's watch the ad again.

18:41.948 --> 18:43.950
Captain, the basement.

18:43.950 --> 18:45.158
We can shore it up
to help stabilize

18:45.158 --> 18:46.642
the floor from underneath.

18:46.642 --> 18:48.127
You went down there
without telling me?

18:48.127 --> 18:49.818
You're supposed to be
securing the perimeter.

18:49.818 --> 18:51.406
The foundation could give
any minute.

18:51.406 --> 18:52.959
Exactly, which is why
we're waiting for USAR

18:52.959 --> 18:54.409
to stabilize the building.

18:54.409 --> 18:56.307
Stand down.
We are following protocol.

18:56.307 --> 18:58.447
We are not losing
any lives today on my watch.

19:05.696 --> 19:07.870
I brought
these illustrations.

19:07.870 --> 19:10.356
They'll let you know
what size the baby would be

19:10.356 --> 19:12.081
according to your last
menstrual period.

19:12.081 --> 19:13.876
Okay.

19:13.876 --> 19:16.327
- Um, Dr. Nancy--
- Oh, Nancy is fine.

19:16.327 --> 19:18.157
Doctor is so formal.

19:18.157 --> 19:21.332
Dr. Nancy,
how far along is she?

19:21.332 --> 19:22.678
It's hard to be exact.

19:22.678 --> 19:24.611
Try.

19:24.611 --> 19:26.095
This might help.

19:28.443 --> 19:30.030
Oh, wow.

19:30.030 --> 19:33.551
Does baby raspberry
already have a face?

19:33.551 --> 19:35.139
Ah, yeah. This--

19:35.139 --> 19:38.694
Well, this really should be
about what Mommy wants.

19:38.694 --> 19:40.869
Well, Mommy wants
an abortion.

19:42.836 --> 19:44.459
Is that what Daddy wants too?

19:44.459 --> 19:46.530
Daddy wants
whatever Mommy wants.

19:46.530 --> 19:51.051
Okay, and I want you to just
please stop talking to us

19:51.051 --> 19:53.399
like we're kittens
in some storybook

19:53.399 --> 19:56.574
and not
in a crisis pregnancy center.

19:56.574 --> 19:59.232
I'm sorry, Nancy,
my friend and husband

19:59.232 --> 20:00.889
are very protective of me.

20:00.889 --> 20:02.235
But--

20:02.235 --> 20:03.409
Would you like
to talk in private?

20:03.409 --> 20:04.755
No, that's okay, but please,

20:04.755 --> 20:06.412
I came here for an abortion.

20:06.412 --> 20:09.863
I don't want to carry
this embryo to term.

20:09.863 --> 20:12.832
Look at you. So technical.

20:12.832 --> 20:15.662
And while I hear you,
I do need to tell you

20:15.662 --> 20:18.769
about some of the risks
that nobody talks about.

20:18.769 --> 20:22.497
For instance, did you know that
studies are being conducted

20:22.497 --> 20:25.948
investigating the link between
women who abort their fetuses

20:25.948 --> 20:28.330
and an increased risk
of developing cancer?

20:28.330 --> 20:30.263
Are these medical studies?

20:30.263 --> 20:31.609
Wait, "studies are
being conducted"

20:31.609 --> 20:33.093
is different from studies
showing something.

20:33.093 --> 20:34.957
Breast cancer is
also a risk factor

20:34.957 --> 20:36.649
that could increase
after abortion.

20:36.649 --> 20:37.891
No, it's not!

20:37.891 --> 20:41.240
Hey, Nancy, Nancy.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.172
Are you a doctor?

20:43.172 --> 20:44.760
I'm a pregnancy professional.

20:44.760 --> 20:46.624
Well, I'm a doctor.

20:46.624 --> 20:49.282
And in my spare time,

20:49.282 --> 20:52.630
when I'm not supporting
my dear friends

20:52.630 --> 20:55.115
going through
a crisis of pregnancy

20:55.115 --> 20:57.739
that they did not plan
and do not want,

20:57.739 --> 20:59.637
I am a doctor.

20:59.637 --> 21:03.779
And abortion does not
increase the risk

21:03.779 --> 21:07.300
of any kind of cancer.

21:07.300 --> 21:08.991
I'm sorry,
I'm gonna have to ask you

21:08.991 --> 21:10.303
to wait outside for the rest
of this appointment.

21:10.303 --> 21:11.546
What? No, no.

21:11.546 --> 21:13.306
I violated
all sorts of protocols

21:13.306 --> 21:15.308
even letting you be
a part of my consultation

21:15.308 --> 21:16.965
with the mama-to-be as it is.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.864
Well, what protocols?
This isn't a medical facility.

21:19.864 --> 21:21.625
Or is it?
- Oh.

21:23.834 --> 21:27.113
We help mommies
and daddies and babies.

21:27.113 --> 21:30.116
And I can show you
just how much

21:30.116 --> 21:31.945
if you'd like to see
the next phase

21:31.945 --> 21:33.982
of the pre-baby experience.

21:37.813 --> 21:41.161
Lead the way.

21:41.161 --> 21:43.819
I told you to leave me alone.

21:43.819 --> 21:45.994
When I leave you alone,
this is what happens.

21:45.994 --> 21:47.858
It's okay. It's okay.

21:47.858 --> 21:50.032
Ah, okay.

21:50.032 --> 21:52.518
Yep, your collarbone's broken.
Okay. Let's get you up.

21:52.518 --> 21:54.830
Slow, slow. Take your time.
- Look at that.

21:54.830 --> 21:56.936
This is how it always ends,
with him playing the victim.

21:56.936 --> 21:58.213
What are you
even talking about?

21:58.213 --> 21:59.525
Okay, you know what, guys?
I think we've had

21:59.525 --> 22:01.043
enough fighting for one day.
- Shut up!

22:01.043 --> 22:03.011
This house was never
just yours to have,

22:03.011 --> 22:05.358
and all of this is exactly why!

22:05.358 --> 22:06.359
Seriously,
you guys need to stop.

22:06.359 --> 22:07.429
- Enough.
- Enough of this.

22:07.429 --> 22:08.637
Gabe.

22:10.018 --> 22:12.641
Gabe!
Gabe, no!

22:12.641 --> 22:14.850
Gabe!

22:14.850 --> 22:17.094
Oh my God. Gabe? Gabe!

22:21.305 --> 22:22.893
Floor collapsed, Cap.

22:22.893 --> 22:25.378
<i>And we now have not one
but two injured civilians.</i>

22:25.378 --> 22:27.000
- Copy.
- Captain.

22:27.000 --> 22:28.381
You see your team out there?

22:28.381 --> 22:30.210
You think this is
their first day on the job?

22:30.210 --> 22:31.902
No.
So quit treating us like it is.

22:31.902 --> 22:33.248
- Oh, excuse me?
- Lieutenant.

22:33.248 --> 22:35.975
Trust us. Trust your team.
Trust yourself.

22:35.975 --> 22:38.115
People inside are in danger.
We need to act fast.

22:38.115 --> 22:41.912
Ruiz, use your team.

22:41.912 --> 22:44.363
Look, you were chosen
to be captain for a reason.

22:44.363 --> 22:45.743
Trust that.

22:49.264 --> 22:50.748
You think
your basement plan will work?

22:50.748 --> 22:52.819
We can use the 4x4s
from the DIY construction

22:52.819 --> 22:53.924
to shore up the floor
from below.

22:53.924 --> 22:55.615
That can buy us some time.

22:57.583 --> 22:59.205
All right.

22:59.205 --> 23:00.551
If you get the floor
stable enough,

23:00.551 --> 23:02.242
we can push a ladder
through the window,

23:02.242 --> 23:03.934
pull the victims to safety.
- Okay.

23:03.934 --> 23:06.902
Take Bishop with you.
both: Yes, sir.

23:06.902 --> 23:09.940
My plan shifts the burden
to Seattle's highest earners,

23:09.940 --> 23:11.942
giving a little more
breathing room

23:11.942 --> 23:13.392
to the middle
and lower classes.

23:13.392 --> 23:15.497
Now, it's not
without some controversy.

23:15.497 --> 23:17.913
But that's the kind of heat
I'm willing to take.

23:17.913 --> 23:19.328
Great to meet you.

23:19.328 --> 23:22.055
Likewise,
Council Member Osman.

23:22.055 --> 23:23.850
He's good. You're better.

23:23.850 --> 23:26.508
Hey, Montgomery.

23:26.508 --> 23:27.992
I'm surprised
you showed your face.

23:27.992 --> 23:29.269
You saw the ad?

23:29.269 --> 23:30.961
Just wait till you see
the next one.

23:30.961 --> 23:32.583
We did some digging,
and we have

23:32.583 --> 23:36.104
some really interesting stories
about your dad, your mom--

23:36.104 --> 23:38.140
You know, you using
my relationship with your son

23:38.140 --> 23:40.453
to dig up dirt on my family
makes you even more disgusting

23:40.453 --> 23:42.144
than I thought,
which is saying something.

23:42.144 --> 23:43.801
Well, the people of Seattle
deserve the truth.

23:43.801 --> 23:45.527
Emmett gets that.

23:45.527 --> 23:47.080
Maybe now's a good time
for you to drop out.

23:49.945 --> 23:51.637
Okay.

23:51.637 --> 23:53.639
Remember, your experiences,
your feelings.

23:53.639 --> 23:56.883
Use the anger.
Just don't throw things.

23:56.883 --> 23:58.471
How much do you think
Dixon weighs?

23:58.471 --> 24:00.128
Come on.

24:00.128 --> 24:03.234
Let's go get ready.

24:03.234 --> 24:05.305
I'm sorry
we got off to a bumpy start.

24:05.305 --> 24:07.825
I get that emotions
are running high.

24:07.825 --> 24:09.724
That's why we save this
for last.

24:09.724 --> 24:13.003
It helps you leave here knowing
just how supported you are

24:13.003 --> 24:16.834
on the magical journey
of motherhood.

24:16.834 --> 24:18.215
Voilà.

24:18.215 --> 24:20.182
We're fully prepared
to help you

24:20.182 --> 24:21.667
for the first year
of the child's life.

24:21.667 --> 24:24.842
We have everything
you could ever need here.

24:24.842 --> 24:27.983
Formula, diapers, bottles.

24:27.983 --> 24:29.502
What?

24:29.502 --> 24:30.814
You know,
not everybody in the world

24:30.814 --> 24:32.367
wants to have children.

24:32.367 --> 24:34.818
We have options
for those kinds of people.

24:34.818 --> 24:36.509
They can just give
the baby up for adoption.

24:36.509 --> 24:37.959
- Ooh!
- Oh, here we go.

24:37.959 --> 24:39.512
"Just adopt," huh?

24:39.512 --> 24:41.031
Do you have any idea
how overburdened

24:41.031 --> 24:42.515
the foster care system is?

24:42.515 --> 24:44.034
I mean, do you ever go see
how those kids

24:44.034 --> 24:46.208
that you force women to have
are doing?

24:46.208 --> 24:47.865
Do you know
that the U.S. has the highest

24:47.865 --> 24:50.350
maternal mortality rate
of any high income country?

24:50.350 --> 24:52.180
You didn't even ask me if I had

24:52.180 --> 24:53.353
a previous problem
with a pregnancy.

24:53.353 --> 24:54.838
You didn't ask me
if I had a condition

24:54.838 --> 24:56.529
that might lead
to serious complication.

24:56.529 --> 24:58.704
Nothing. I'm an OB.

24:58.704 --> 25:01.327
I've seen those complications.
I've seen women bleed out.

25:01.327 --> 25:03.053
But of course,
you don't even know

25:03.053 --> 25:06.056
because you're just wearing
a white coat, playing doctor.

25:06.056 --> 25:08.058
Everything we do here
is legal.

25:08.058 --> 25:10.370
If you don't like it,
call your congressperson.

25:10.370 --> 25:12.269
This is your tax dollars
hard at work.

25:12.269 --> 25:13.719
Oh, say what?

25:13.719 --> 25:16.066
Oh, that's the first
true thing she's said today.

25:16.066 --> 25:17.792
<i>- Security to the...</i>
- Oh.

25:17.792 --> 25:19.518
So they're tricking women
into going to what they think

25:19.518 --> 25:21.692
is your clinic,
but it's with fake doctors

25:21.692 --> 25:24.868
and fake nurses
and people like Nancy here

25:24.868 --> 25:27.905
who pretend to care,
and I'm paying for it?

25:27.905 --> 25:30.874
Oh, no, no. No. Nope.

25:30.874 --> 25:32.461
Hey, how do you do it?

25:32.461 --> 25:35.810
How do you lie
to vulnerable people?

25:35.810 --> 25:37.708
I care about life.

25:37.708 --> 25:40.262
- Okay. Let's go.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

25:40.262 --> 25:42.264
- Hey! Get your hands off me.
- Hey, don't touch me.

25:42.264 --> 25:44.646
You're gonna want to do
what she says.

25:44.646 --> 25:47.200
No touching.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.273
Wow.

25:51.273 --> 25:53.897
All right.

25:53.897 --> 25:55.450
This will buy us some time

25:55.450 --> 25:57.348
until Hughes and Gibson can
get out with the vice.

25:57.348 --> 25:58.936
Hughes, Gibson,
the floor is secure for now,

25:58.936 --> 26:00.110
but we don't know how long.

26:00.110 --> 26:01.387
Ruiz wasted so much time.

26:01.387 --> 26:02.561
We've all been there.

26:06.288 --> 26:07.600
If that floor shifts
any more...

26:07.600 --> 26:09.775
The whole house is
gonna come down on him.

26:09.775 --> 26:10.948
We have to secure him
until they can get

26:10.948 --> 26:12.087
the ladder in here.

26:12.087 --> 26:14.745
Uh... okay.

26:14.745 --> 26:16.782
I can get to him.
Give me your webbing.

26:16.782 --> 26:18.266
If he slips through there
and the floor falls on him,

26:18.266 --> 26:19.267
he's a goner.

26:19.267 --> 26:21.580
Gabe, you good?

26:21.580 --> 26:22.788
Wake up.

26:26.136 --> 26:28.172
Gabe, you gotta wake up.
Please be okay, bud.

26:28.172 --> 26:29.277
Please be okay.

26:29.277 --> 26:30.934
I'm so sorry.

26:30.934 --> 26:32.970
It's gonna be okay, Jim.

26:32.970 --> 26:34.972
Ready?
- Steady.

26:34.972 --> 26:37.526
Okay.

26:38.942 --> 26:43.463
Okay.

26:55.544 --> 26:57.650
Whoa, whoa, Gabe?

26:57.650 --> 26:59.479
Hey, hey.
Want me to pull you back?

26:59.479 --> 27:00.998
Just wait till I secure him.

27:00.998 --> 27:02.482
Just wait till I secure him,
and then I'll tell you

27:02.482 --> 27:04.312
when to pull me up, okay?

27:04.312 --> 27:06.141
Okay.

27:13.148 --> 27:15.150
Okay. Okay.

27:15.150 --> 27:17.463
Okay.

27:17.463 --> 27:20.190
All right.

27:20.190 --> 27:21.674
Please don't let
my brother die.

27:21.674 --> 27:23.849
Please don't let him die.
- Okay.

27:26.852 --> 27:28.992
- You got him?
- Give me a little more slack.

27:28.992 --> 27:30.994
How's he doing? Is he okay?

27:30.994 --> 27:32.478
Is he okay?

27:32.478 --> 27:34.169
It's okay, Jim.

27:37.276 --> 27:38.691
All right. I got him.
Coming up.

27:38.691 --> 27:40.348
All right. Come on.

27:40.348 --> 27:42.488
You got it. I got you.

27:42.488 --> 27:44.593
Okay.

27:44.593 --> 27:46.595
Steady.

27:46.595 --> 27:48.356
Easy.

27:51.600 --> 27:53.430
Okay, okay.

27:53.430 --> 27:55.674
- Yeah.
- Okay, hold.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.537
Okay.

27:57.537 --> 27:59.367
We got him, Jim. Okay.

29:43.816 --> 29:46.232
When our mom was alive,

29:46.232 --> 29:49.304
a fight never lasted long.

29:49.304 --> 29:51.479
She loved this house.

29:51.479 --> 29:53.343
You just wanted to sell it.

29:53.343 --> 29:56.311
Renovating the house is not
gonna bring her back, Gabe.

- Yes.

30:20.646 --> 30:21.854
- What?
- All right.

30:21.854 --> 30:23.476
Oh, is that--

30:25.030 --> 30:26.479
crowd:
Hey, hey, ho, ho!

30:26.479 --> 30:28.757
Fake doctors have got to go!

30:28.757 --> 30:30.759
Ha! Nice touch.

30:30.759 --> 30:34.004
They protest us,
we protest them.

30:34.004 --> 30:36.765
We gotta let
the truth be known.

30:36.765 --> 30:38.940
- Hey.
- Hi.

30:38.940 --> 30:40.459
- You guys are the best.
- Good.

30:40.459 --> 30:42.185
Good to see you. Yeah.
- Hey!

30:42.185 --> 30:43.842
crowd:
Fake doctors have got to go.

30:43.842 --> 30:46.051
Hey, hey, ho, ho.

30:46.051 --> 30:47.776
Fake doctors have got to go.

30:47.776 --> 30:50.020
Hey, hey, ho, ho.

30:50.020 --> 30:51.539
- Thank you.
- Hey.

30:51.539 --> 30:53.541
Um...

30:53.541 --> 30:55.784
that is a real clinic.

30:55.784 --> 30:58.132
Go there.

30:58.132 --> 30:59.788
crowd:
Fake doctors have got to go.

30:59.788 --> 31:02.205
Hey, hey, ho, ho.

31:02.205 --> 31:03.896
Fake doctors have got to go.
- Turn it up, turn it up!

31:03.896 --> 31:06.140
crowd:
Hey, hey, ho, ho.

31:06.140 --> 31:08.038
Fake doctors have got to go.

31:13.837 --> 31:15.632
Tough first day, Captain?

31:19.256 --> 31:21.741
You know, I thought--

31:21.741 --> 31:23.329
I had one thought this morning.

31:23.329 --> 31:26.263
It was just,
"Don't be like him.

31:26.263 --> 31:28.714
Don't be like Beckett."

31:28.714 --> 31:30.543
Well, that's easy.

31:30.543 --> 31:31.717
You're not drunk.

31:31.717 --> 31:33.477
Also, you care.

31:33.477 --> 31:35.272
Too much.

31:35.272 --> 31:37.930
No. I got in the way.

31:37.930 --> 31:40.070
I overdid it. That's--

31:40.070 --> 31:43.280
Look, we all knew
you could do this job.

31:43.280 --> 31:45.731
And at the end,
you made the right call.

31:45.731 --> 31:50.080
We're all safe, all together.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.496
Let's call today a win.

32:02.472 --> 32:06.545
And while Seattle does have
some different DNA

32:06.545 --> 32:09.548
in its makeup, I do think
a Denmark-style model

32:09.548 --> 32:12.102
could offer
a satisfactory solution.

32:15.968 --> 32:17.866
Can I speak to that?

32:17.866 --> 32:21.318
Mr. Dixon,
you have the floor.

32:21.318 --> 32:24.977
My opponent,
Mr. Osman, has been

32:24.977 --> 32:28.636
behind the scenes of this city
for over a decade now.

32:28.636 --> 32:31.639
Why, then, hasn't he done
anything by now?

32:31.639 --> 32:33.848
It's very suspicious timing
that he suddenly has

32:33.848 --> 32:37.231
all these great ideas
when he's running for mayor.

32:37.231 --> 32:40.717
Then you have
the other guy in this race.

32:40.717 --> 32:44.169
Zero ideas, no experience.

32:44.169 --> 32:46.654
It'd be like handing
the keys of a Ferrari

32:46.654 --> 32:48.621
to a toddler.

32:51.521 --> 32:55.490
Travis Montgomery,
you have time to comment.

32:55.490 --> 32:57.354
Uh--

33:02.497 --> 33:06.018
Um, Mr. Montgomery?

33:06.018 --> 33:07.571
Do you have
any electrical tape?

33:07.571 --> 33:09.884
Over here.

33:09.884 --> 33:12.818
Yes, thank you.
Sorry, that's a fire hazard.

33:16.995 --> 33:19.549
I'd rather spend 90 seconds
and stop a problem

33:19.549 --> 33:21.447
before it got,
you know, bigger.

33:21.447 --> 33:23.656
You know, more dangerous,
more destructive.

33:23.656 --> 33:25.555
And I know--I know--

33:25.555 --> 33:28.730
I know we're talking about
spending and taxes and money.

33:28.730 --> 33:31.492
And I did study all that stuff.
I swear. I promise.

33:33.183 --> 33:35.910
But, uh,

33:35.910 --> 33:38.223
I couldn't even start
that conversation

33:38.223 --> 33:40.949
without first making sure

33:40.949 --> 33:44.229
that we were all safe.

33:44.229 --> 33:45.678
That's it.

33:45.678 --> 33:49.475
All done. Not too painful.

33:49.475 --> 33:51.477
Was there a question?
I didn't--

33:54.722 --> 33:56.965
Let's go, Travis!

33:56.965 --> 33:58.415
Great job, Trav!

33:58.415 --> 34:00.314
- Whoo-hoo!
- All right, Travis!

34:06.354 --> 34:08.253
I get it now.
Why you had to see it.

34:08.253 --> 34:10.082
If you told me
some of the things Nancy said,

34:10.082 --> 34:11.911
I'd have never believed you.

34:11.911 --> 34:14.259
All right, I help women

34:14.259 --> 34:16.606
bring life into this world
screaming in agony

34:16.606 --> 34:18.504
as their bodies are
twisted inside out.

34:18.504 --> 34:21.266
It's the kind of decision
that requires certainty,

34:21.266 --> 34:24.062
and I say that as somebody
who wants to have a baby.

34:24.062 --> 34:25.684
This world is going crazy.

34:25.684 --> 34:28.342
Which is why I think
you need to take me seriously.

34:28.342 --> 34:29.998
All right?
It's not safe anymore, Miranda.

34:29.998 --> 34:31.517
And that terrifies me.

34:31.517 --> 34:34.037
I'm terrified
every time you go to work.

34:34.037 --> 34:36.281
Whenever you're on shift,
I have to talk myself

34:36.281 --> 34:38.904
out of all sorts of thoughts.

34:38.904 --> 34:41.596
But I know
you're not gonna quit.

34:41.596 --> 34:43.460
And you're not gonna quit.
I--I wouldn't want you to.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.117
I just--

34:45.117 --> 34:47.085
I just want you to be safe.

34:47.085 --> 34:50.847
I need you to protect yourself.

34:50.847 --> 34:52.676
I love you, Ben Warren.

34:52.676 --> 34:55.714
All right.

34:55.714 --> 34:59.787
But if you try to put
a bedazzled taser in my hand,

34:59.787 --> 35:02.755
so help me.

35:02.755 --> 35:04.792
Okay. I have to go.

35:04.792 --> 35:06.621
I have to go
tell Maya something.

35:06.621 --> 35:08.658
Okay.

35:08.658 --> 35:10.108
- Thank you for dinner.
- Bye-bye.

35:11.971 --> 35:14.629
I'll bedazzle anything
I think will make you safe.

35:16.735 --> 35:18.944
Oh, my--you still haven't
texted him back yet?

35:18.944 --> 35:20.842
Andy!
- I'm allowed to take my time.

35:20.842 --> 35:22.741
Okay, well, if this guy were
a firefighter,

35:22.741 --> 35:25.709
you would have said "hell yes"
or "hell no" by now, okay?

35:25.709 --> 35:27.055
You're just--

35:27.055 --> 35:29.161
hon, you're being
careful with Eli.

35:29.161 --> 35:31.370
Tell me,
why do you think that is?

35:31.370 --> 35:32.751
Okay.

35:32.751 --> 35:34.408
You spent way too much time
with Diane.

35:34.408 --> 35:36.168
Oh, yeah,
but it's working, right?

35:36.168 --> 35:38.032
Looks good.

35:38.032 --> 35:39.999
God, is it just me
or is Theo being, like...

35:39.999 --> 35:41.484
- Oof!
- "Ugh" today?

35:41.484 --> 35:43.417
Look, he got through it.

35:43.417 --> 35:44.970
Yeah, I'm not sure
I'm through it yet.

35:48.249 --> 35:51.873
Okay, just being selfish,

35:51.873 --> 35:55.705
I rely on Eli to make your life
a rom-com roller coaster.

35:55.705 --> 35:57.603
And I know he's really busy
with Travis or whatever,

35:57.603 --> 35:58.846
but just text him back.

35:58.846 --> 36:00.365
You like him. He likes you.

36:00.365 --> 36:02.367
Don't overthink it.

36:02.367 --> 36:05.370
Just please don't--
don't take this away from me.

36:05.370 --> 36:06.543
I need it.
<i>- Hughes, can you come</i>

36:06.543 --> 36:07.510
<i>to the captain's office?</i>

36:07.510 --> 36:09.132
I need it!

36:13.654 --> 36:17.554
So things got a little heated
between you and Ruiz.

36:17.554 --> 36:20.661
Well, I just, uh, did
what needed to be done.

36:20.661 --> 36:23.215
Mm.

36:23.215 --> 36:25.528
Why didn't Ross ask you
to do the job?

36:26.943 --> 36:28.220
Why didn't she ask you?

36:28.220 --> 36:31.568
She did, and I said no.

36:31.568 --> 36:33.846
I've earned a real promotion
when it comes up,

36:33.846 --> 36:34.882
not a babysitting gig.

36:34.882 --> 36:38.265
So again,
why didn't she ask you?

36:40.888 --> 36:42.407
You'd have to ask her.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.388
Maya?

36:58.388 --> 37:00.079
Hey.

37:00.079 --> 37:02.081
Ah, I am glad you're here.

37:02.081 --> 37:03.600
I was gonna call you,

37:03.600 --> 37:07.259
but you're here,
which is even better

37:07.259 --> 37:08.433
because I had a whole day
to think.

37:08.433 --> 37:11.781
I know I seemed
disappointed earlier,

37:11.781 --> 37:16.095
and I was,
but I understand something now.

37:16.095 --> 37:18.960
We never finished
our foundation.

37:18.960 --> 37:21.273
And I made things worse
by trying to build

37:21.273 --> 37:26.451
this whole huge,
amazing structure on...

37:26.451 --> 37:28.729
this foundation
that couldn't support it.

37:28.729 --> 37:30.455
Hmm.

37:30.455 --> 37:34.976
But, Carina,
I want to fix it.

37:34.976 --> 37:39.118
<i>♪ Hide
in a splintered shelter ♪</i>

37:39.118 --> 37:41.224
I want to fix it too.

37:41.224 --> 37:43.537
I know you're trying
and you have been trying.

37:43.537 --> 37:46.988
I haven't been clear with you.

37:46.988 --> 37:49.370
And although
you'll keep trying,

37:49.370 --> 37:52.235
I know you can't read my mind, so...

37:54.962 --> 37:56.757
I want to be with you.

37:56.757 --> 37:57.792
I want that a lot.

37:57.792 --> 37:59.104
A lot.

37:59.104 --> 38:00.968
And every time I'm near you,

38:00.968 --> 38:03.488
I just want to let gravity
pull me back to you,

38:03.488 --> 38:06.491
but I need to know

38:06.491 --> 38:09.977
that this foundation
you're talking about is real.

38:09.977 --> 38:12.600
I need you to win me back.

38:12.600 --> 38:15.845
Slowly.

38:15.845 --> 38:19.400
Uh, and what does that mean?

38:19.400 --> 38:20.574
Wait, wait, wait.

38:20.574 --> 38:22.990
Okay, how about this
for slowly?

38:22.990 --> 38:25.199
Hmm.

38:25.199 --> 38:29.341
Carina DeLuca,
will you go on a date with me?

38:29.341 --> 38:31.343
All you had to do was
tell me over the radio

38:31.343 --> 38:33.172
that you were busy.
- I did. I did!

38:33.172 --> 38:35.002
And you just kept going
and going and going.

38:35.002 --> 38:36.348
Yeah, things were
happening fast.

38:36.348 --> 38:38.350
I know, I know.

38:38.350 --> 38:40.318
I was trying to keep two guys
from killing each other,

38:40.318 --> 38:41.871
and it was just like,
"Hughes, update.

38:41.871 --> 38:42.906
Hughes, update.
Hughes, update."

38:42.906 --> 38:44.080
Every three seconds.

38:44.080 --> 38:45.184
And Gibson was
right there, Theo.

38:45.184 --> 38:46.841
It's not like I went dark.

38:46.841 --> 38:48.533
The job is
to keep the comms open.

38:48.533 --> 38:49.706
That's the one thing I asked.
- Oh, God. Yeah.

38:49.706 --> 38:51.190
I forgot, I forgot.
I'm sorry the guy

38:51.190 --> 38:52.364
who can't even talk
to his girlfriend

38:52.364 --> 38:53.883
is now suddenly
all about communication.

38:53.883 --> 38:55.022
I'm an open book.
You know that.

38:55.022 --> 38:58.197
You were an open--

38:58.197 --> 38:59.371
never mind.
- No, no, no, no.

38:59.371 --> 39:00.993
- No, I--
- Say what's on your mind.

39:00.993 --> 39:03.548
I don't--

39:03.548 --> 39:06.378
You--

39:06.378 --> 39:09.347
you weren't an open book
when Chief Ross gave you

39:09.347 --> 39:11.107
all the credit
for the arson investigation.

39:11.107 --> 39:12.350
Theo, we did that.

39:12.350 --> 39:13.696
We did that together,

39:13.696 --> 39:15.525
and you didn't say a word
to her about it.

39:15.525 --> 39:16.733
And that's why you're upset?

39:16.733 --> 39:18.252
I mean, I'll call
and tell her right now

39:18.252 --> 39:19.287
if that's what you want.
- No, I don't want--stop.

39:19.287 --> 39:20.875
I don't--I don't want that.

39:20.875 --> 39:22.049
I'm just--I don't know--

39:27.226 --> 39:28.469
Yeah, I don't know.

39:28.469 --> 39:30.954
You just don't seem
even remotely interested

39:30.954 --> 39:34.026
in sharing you with me

39:34.026 --> 39:36.926
unless I drag it out of you.

39:36.926 --> 39:40.067
Theo, I can't help you
unless you let me help you.

39:40.067 --> 39:43.070
Look, you are not
my therapist.

39:43.070 --> 39:44.761
Just--
- Wow.

39:44.761 --> 39:46.763
Just--just don't turn
your radio off, Hughes.

39:46.763 --> 39:49.317
<i>♪ That was the deal</i>

39:49.317 --> 39:51.250
Okay. Yep.

39:51.250 --> 39:55.427
<i>♪ Bird in the hand</i>

39:55.427 --> 39:57.325
<i>♪ Heart on a sleeve</i>

39:57.325 --> 39:59.569
Did you see
the look on his face

39:59.569 --> 40:00.846
when I talked
about his time at FD?

40:00.846 --> 40:02.607
He was truly vexed.

40:02.607 --> 40:04.505
And how about when Robel
and I both called him out?

40:04.505 --> 40:05.782
This is what
I'm talking about, man!

40:05.782 --> 40:07.266
Speaking truth to power.

40:07.266 --> 40:08.682
Keeping the forces
of evil at bay.

40:08.682 --> 40:10.477
And you're 100% right, okay?

40:10.477 --> 40:12.789
When I talk about what I know,
and I'm pretty good at that--

40:12.789 --> 40:14.757
- You're very good, I'd say.
- You know what?

40:14.757 --> 40:16.621
If the people want me, then--
then I guess that's what--

40:16.621 --> 40:17.932
I think
the people do want you.

40:17.932 --> 40:19.934
Well, good. Good.

40:19.934 --> 40:21.660
It's good to be wanted.

40:40.955 --> 40:43.199

40:48.480 --> 40:53.140
<i>♪ Ooh, fly away</i>

41:15.473 --> 41:16.750
Brought you coffee.

41:16.750 --> 41:18.027
I'm about to go to bed.

41:18.027 --> 41:19.338
I drink coffee all day long.

41:19.338 --> 41:20.754
I never have trouble sleeping.

41:20.754 --> 41:22.410
Yeah, one of your many
red flags.

41:22.410 --> 41:25.172
Hey.

41:25.172 --> 41:27.312
I know you have problems
with Chief Ross,

41:27.312 --> 41:28.520
how she does things,

41:28.520 --> 41:29.935
who she promotes,
who she doesn't.

41:29.935 --> 41:31.937
I just want to go to bed.

41:31.937 --> 41:33.767
Come on.
Just open the envelope.

41:33.767 --> 41:36.183
I know you're at least
a little bit curious.

41:45.054 --> 41:49.368
If the Union saw those,
it'd be pretty good for me.

41:49.368 --> 41:51.888
And if it's good for me,

41:51.888 --> 41:53.890
it'll be good
for you too, Bishop.

42:41.248 --> 42:43.215
<i>Fantastic.</i>
