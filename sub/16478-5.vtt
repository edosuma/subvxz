09:31.301 --> 09:33.335
wanting answers.

09:33.337 --> 09:36.571
Would a bullet to
the pilot's head help?

09:38.000 --> 09:44.074

09:51.408 --> 09:53.417
LASALLE: <i>The pilot wasn't killed</i>
<i>by the crash,</i>

09:53.418 --> 09:55.652
<i>but by a gunshot wound</i>
<i>to the head?</i>

09:55.654 --> 09:58.722
Not only the pilot, but
the co-pilot was shot too.

09:58.724 --> 10:01.324
Except Mr. Varela was shot
in the chest.

10:01.326 --> 10:03.126
Neither wound
was initially apparent

10:03.128 --> 10:05.094
to the M.E.'s on scene because

10:05.096 --> 10:07.630
the bodies had been
so badly burned.

10:07.632 --> 10:08.731
Best I can tell,

10:08.733 --> 10:09.999
they were shot at close range.

10:10.001 --> 10:12.168
So, two dead pilots
at the stick,

10:12.170 --> 10:14.370
I guess we can rule out
mechanical failure.

10:14.372 --> 10:16.739
What about these other
passengers?

10:16.741 --> 10:20.409
Loadmaster and sailors
died from severe

10:20.411 --> 10:22.711
head trauma, broken spines

10:22.713 --> 10:26.482
and just all manner of other
catastrophic injuries.

10:26.484 --> 10:28.183
But no gunshot wounds.
WADE: No.

10:28.185 --> 10:30.753
The shots were apparently
limited to the cockpit.

10:31.322 --> 10:32.421
Murder-suicide?

10:32.423 --> 10:33.889
It's likely,

10:33.891 --> 10:36.160
but the results are still
very preliminary.

10:36.184 --> 10:37.160
Well,

10:37.161 --> 10:38.994
any way to figure out
which one pulled the trigger?

10:38.996 --> 10:41.229
That's early to tell,
but all things being equal,

10:41.231 --> 10:45.033
it is easier to shoot yourself
in the head than the chest.

10:45.035 --> 10:46.201
So our pilot,

10:46.203 --> 10:48.937
Rodriguez, shoots his copilot

10:48.939 --> 10:50.438
so no one can save the plane,

10:50.440 --> 10:52.040
and then takes himself out?

10:52.042 --> 10:54.075
I mean, that's a heck of
a dramatic way to go out.

10:54.077 --> 10:55.543
Yeah and if that's
what happened,

10:55.545 --> 10:57.345
he took a lot of innocent lives
with him,

10:57.347 --> 10:58.746
including three sailors.

10:58.748 --> 11:00.748
Cartel?
Maybe.

11:00.750 --> 11:04.285
But the question is: why?

11:06.623 --> 11:09.290
I was married to Juan
for five years.

11:09.292 --> 11:11.158
(crying)

11:11.160 --> 11:13.227
Thank you.

11:13.229 --> 11:14.561
(sniffles)

11:14.563 --> 11:17.364
Did you and Juan first
meet in Colombia?

11:17.366 --> 11:20.500
No, uh, we met in Rio.

11:20.502 --> 11:22.203
I was visiting from here.

11:22.205 --> 11:26.941
I saw him at a bar,
he was so handsome.

11:26.943 --> 11:29.275
I bought him a drink.

11:29.277 --> 11:33.146
How much do you know about
Juan's life before you two met?

11:33.148 --> 11:35.181
Before?

11:35.183 --> 11:38.084
I don't know... n-not much,
I guess, why?

11:38.086 --> 11:40.019
Please understand,
Mrs. Rodriguez...

11:40.021 --> 11:41.020
Maria.

11:41.022 --> 11:43.523
Maria...

11:43.525 --> 11:45.358
We're trying to find out

11:45.360 --> 11:47.493
what caused your husband's
plane to go down.

11:47.495 --> 11:49.095
We have to look at everything.

11:49.097 --> 11:50.730
But...

11:50.732 --> 11:53.333
what does when we first met
have to do with anything?

11:53.335 --> 11:54.767
Do you know who Juan flew for

11:54.769 --> 11:56.569
before he started working for
Everglades Air?

11:56.571 --> 11:58.204
We can't find much history
on him,

11:58.206 --> 12:00.473
other than he freelanced.

12:02.209 --> 12:04.910
If you want to ask me something,

12:04.912 --> 12:06.945
why don't you just come out
and say it?

12:06.947 --> 12:08.981
GREGORIO:
Okay.

12:08.983 --> 12:11.149
Mrs. Rodriguez,
do you know whether or not

12:11.151 --> 12:12.785
your husband ever flew for,

12:12.787 --> 12:16.655
or had any connection to
the Ciudad Natal cartel?

12:16.657 --> 12:18.891
(scoffs)

12:18.893 --> 12:20.292
What?

12:20.294 --> 12:21.659
MARIA:
You said you wanted to help,

12:21.661 --> 12:23.929
and now you're
accusing my husband?

12:23.931 --> 12:25.830
(crying)

12:28.635 --> 12:30.335
Well, that didn't go well,
I take it.

12:30.337 --> 12:33.305
She's understandably upset,
but we had to ask.

12:33.307 --> 12:35.473
Does she know anything?
Don't think so, which means

12:35.475 --> 12:37.542
she didn't know her husband was
working for the cartel...

12:37.544 --> 12:38.743
Or he wasn't.

12:39.746 --> 12:41.813
Recovery team locate
the murder weapon yet?

12:41.815 --> 12:43.515
Shallow waters,
near the cockpit.

12:43.517 --> 12:44.883
Couldn't salvage any prints.

12:44.885 --> 12:46.284
And it's a ghost gun.

12:46.286 --> 12:48.352
No serial numbers,
no way of tracing it.

12:48.354 --> 12:50.421
Doesn't exactly let Rodriguez
off the hook.

12:50.423 --> 12:52.856
I mean, pilot could sneak a gun
on board easily,

12:52.858 --> 12:54.358
especially in Brazil
and especially on charters.

12:54.360 --> 12:56.093
Still,

12:56.095 --> 12:58.329
if he's not Natal and he has
no other obvious motives,

12:58.331 --> 12:59.663
why would he do it?
(phone chirps)

12:59.665 --> 13:01.565
Sebastian got the black boxes,

13:01.567 --> 13:03.634
maybe he's got something.

13:05.071 --> 13:07.404
Hoping the cockpit voice
recorder gave you something

13:07.406 --> 13:08.639
that can help, Sebastian.

13:08.641 --> 13:10.307
Uh, yeah, well,
as you might expect,

13:10.309 --> 13:12.443
the black boxes were
pretty badly burned,

13:12.445 --> 13:14.812
which makes me wonder why
they don't make a outer shell

13:14.814 --> 13:17.047
with a higher thermal
conductivity than titanium.

13:17.049 --> 13:18.281
You know, like a....

13:18.283 --> 13:19.917
These tangents of his common?

13:20.719 --> 13:21.785
It's a lovable quirk.

13:21.787 --> 13:22.753
Oh.

13:22.755 --> 13:24.054
Oh, thanks, Percy.

13:24.056 --> 13:25.322
Black boxes, Sebastian...

13:25.324 --> 13:27.857
Right, yeah, uh...
they're useless.

13:27.859 --> 13:29.625
I mean, it would take months of
digital wizardry

13:29.627 --> 13:30.626
to recover anything.

13:30.628 --> 13:31.928
Well, why'd you text?

13:31.930 --> 13:33.296
No, it wasn't about
the black boxes,

13:33.298 --> 13:34.297
it was about your shooter.

13:34.299 --> 13:35.565
The pilot, Rodriguez?

13:35.567 --> 13:37.633
Oh, uh, I don't think that
it was the pilot.

13:37.635 --> 13:39.069
Because when I ran forensics
on all the victims,

13:39.071 --> 13:41.337
the only gunshot residue that
I did find

13:41.339 --> 13:43.473
was on Petty Officer Saad's
right forearm.

13:43.475 --> 13:44.707
Our navy guy?

13:44.709 --> 13:46.075
Yeah, I'm still trying
to reconstruct

13:46.077 --> 13:47.409
exactly what went down, but

13:47.411 --> 13:49.311
P.O. Saad definitely
pulled the trigger.

13:49.313 --> 13:51.013
So much for the cartel.

13:51.015 --> 13:52.281
Yeah, and your fast pass
out of here.

13:52.283 --> 13:54.016
Hold on, why would
our petty officer,

13:54.018 --> 13:55.250
hitching a ride home,

13:55.252 --> 13:56.918
bring down a plane?

13:56.920 --> 14:00.089
Saad was recently demoted
from chief for anger issues,

14:00.091 --> 14:02.891
altercations with his C.O.

14:02.893 --> 14:05.361
Could be that he was hoping
to hit the navy base.

14:05.363 --> 14:08.397
Just... crashed a little early.

14:08.399 --> 14:12.134
So, what, he was trying to
get revenge against the navy?

14:12.136 --> 14:14.335
Just for being busted down
a couple ranks?

14:14.337 --> 14:15.737
That doesn't make sense.

14:15.739 --> 14:18.106
Does Saad have any
family members we can talk to,

14:18.108 --> 14:20.174
help us with motives?

14:20.176 --> 14:22.777
A daughter,
his only living relative.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.581
Gregorio said she's got a chip
on her shoulder, too.

14:26.583 --> 14:28.683
Wonder if it's connected.

14:29.552 --> 14:31.519
(piano playing)

14:41.697 --> 14:43.498
My father tried calling,

14:43.500 --> 14:45.966
left some voice mails,
but I wasn't really interested.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.701
We didn't really talk much.

14:47.703 --> 14:49.737
Well, seems like he was trying
to reach out to you, though.

14:49.739 --> 14:51.906
Probably to make sure I was
watering the lawn,

14:51.908 --> 14:53.774
taking care of the house.

14:53.776 --> 14:57.711
Look, he abandoned me and my mom
a long time ago,

14:57.713 --> 15:00.981
and then didn't even bother
to show up at her funeral.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.350
I wasn't really interested
in “reaching out.”

15:03.352 --> 15:05.818
Still, you're his child,

15:05.820 --> 15:07.587
his only family
in New Orleans.

15:07.589 --> 15:09.356
He was coming back for a reason.

15:09.358 --> 15:12.059
Like I said, I wouldn't know,

15:12.061 --> 15:13.893
and I don't care.

15:16.298 --> 15:19.165
(piano playing continues)

15:19.167 --> 15:20.499
And you don't care that
he might be responsible

15:20.501 --> 15:22.134
for what happened either?

15:22.136 --> 15:23.937
Only that I'll probably have
to change my name now

15:23.939 --> 15:25.004
so I don't have to spend
the rest of my life

15:25.006 --> 15:26.338
running away from what he did.

15:26.340 --> 15:28.140
Oh, yeah, well let me tell you
something.

15:28.142 --> 15:29.842
Changing your name won't
change jack.

15:29.844 --> 15:31.177
And while we're at it,
this whole little

15:31.179 --> 15:32.344
“I don't give a crap” facade

15:32.346 --> 15:33.880
isn't going to do you
or us any good,

15:33.882 --> 15:35.381
so let's just get real here.

15:35.383 --> 15:37.583
We're trying to figure out
why six people died.

15:37.585 --> 15:41.220
Now, maybe you don't care,
but other people do.

15:44.024 --> 15:45.224
Okay?

15:48.162 --> 15:50.696
Okay.
(sniffs)

15:52.232 --> 15:55.233
Is there anything

15:55.235 --> 15:56.802
you can help us with, Emily?

15:56.804 --> 15:58.770
Anything at all about your dad?

16:00.741 --> 16:02.507
His voice mails, maybe?

16:02.509 --> 16:05.543
You had to listen to
some of 'em.

16:10.650 --> 16:13.551
He kept saying he was trying
to get transferred

16:13.553 --> 16:16.588
back to New Orleans,
but that none were approved.

16:18.091 --> 16:19.924
He kept promising that

16:19.926 --> 16:21.226
he wouldn't give up,

16:21.228 --> 16:22.460
that he'd find a way.

16:22.462 --> 16:24.562
Back to you.

16:26.565 --> 16:28.666
Yeah.

16:33.506 --> 16:36.373
PRIDE: <i>Man wants to make amends</i>
<i>with his daughter,</i>

16:36.375 --> 16:38.175
doesn't make sense he'd
take down the very plane

16:38.177 --> 16:39.543
that brings him to her.

16:39.545 --> 16:41.578
Still, Sebastian found
gun residue on Saad.

16:41.580 --> 16:43.647
He's got anger issues,
got demoted.

16:43.649 --> 16:45.582
Maybe he wanted to get demoted.

16:45.584 --> 16:48.051
So they'd have to bring him back
for a navy review.

16:48.053 --> 16:49.620
Emily said he was desperate
to find a way home,

16:49.622 --> 16:51.054
that's a sure way.

16:51.056 --> 16:53.790
So, what is that famous instinct
of yours saying?

16:53.792 --> 16:56.059
That we're still looking for
what brought that plane down,

16:56.061 --> 16:58.494
and it wasn't
Petty Officer Saad.

16:59.698 --> 17:01.698
Good job opening up
his daughter back there.

17:03.035 --> 17:06.036
Wouldn't have found out
about the transfer,

17:06.038 --> 17:08.905
or Saad's possible
innocence if you hadn't.

17:08.906 --> 17:10.674
Yeah, well, guess I can
relate to Emily

17:10.675 --> 17:13.376
a little more than
I care to admit.

17:14.779 --> 17:16.612
Don't ask.

17:16.614 --> 17:18.281
Wasn't gonna.

17:21.919 --> 17:23.486
LASALLE:
<i>What do you mean you were wrong</i>

17:23.488 --> 17:25.119
<i>about Petty Officer Saad?</i>

17:25.122 --> 17:26.589
It's a plane crash, okay?

17:26.590 --> 17:28.357
There're a lot of moving pieces
to untangle

17:28.358 --> 17:30.326
and you guys keep pressuring me
for definitive answers.

17:30.328 --> 17:33.662
Yeah, because everybody's
pressuring us for answers,

17:33.664 --> 17:34.863
including the media.

17:34.865 --> 17:36.298
Look, they're chomping
at the bit.

17:36.300 --> 17:38.767
I.e., what do you got?
Yeah.

17:38.769 --> 17:41.403
All right, well, I analyzed
the bullet fragmentation

17:41.405 --> 17:43.739
along with the, uh,
wounds sustained

17:43.741 --> 17:45.708
by both the co-pilot
and the pilot,

17:45.710 --> 17:48.109
plotted bullet trajectories,
and that's when I discovered

17:48.111 --> 17:50.412
that there's no way Saad
could've shot the pilot.

17:50.414 --> 17:51.713
(sighs)

17:51.715 --> 17:53.615
Are you playing with dolls
again, Sebastian?

17:53.617 --> 17:54.882
All right, first of all,
they're not dolls,

17:54.884 --> 17:56.585
they're collectibles. Okay?

17:56.587 --> 17:58.152
And I didn't have time to
do a computer reenactment.

17:58.154 --> 17:59.454
Okay, guys, wait.

17:59.456 --> 18:02.457
Are you saying
Petty Officer Saad

18:02.459 --> 18:05.159
didn't shoot the pilot?
Then who did?

18:05.161 --> 18:07.161
Well, based on the angle
of the entry wound,

18:07.163 --> 18:09.063
co-pilot Varela had to be
the one that shot him.

18:09.065 --> 18:10.531
Well, then, who shot Varela?

18:10.533 --> 18:12.266
That was Petty Officer Saad.

18:12.268 --> 18:13.901
(Sonja sighs, groans)

18:13.903 --> 18:15.603
All right, all right,
check it out.

18:15.605 --> 18:18.139
So, co-pilot shoots
pilot, right? Bang.

18:18.141 --> 18:20.441
But Saad hears the gunshot...

18:21.810 --> 18:23.910
<i>then the plane starts</i>
<i>its death dive.</i>

18:23.912 --> 18:26.079
Saad somehow makes his way
into the cockpit,

18:28.484 --> 18:31.017
wrestles the gun
away from Varela,

18:31.019 --> 18:33.086
then shoots him in the chest.

18:33.922 --> 18:36.123
Well, do you have any
gunshot residue

18:36.125 --> 18:37.457
on the co-pilot to back that up?

18:37.459 --> 18:39.192
Yeah, I did a, uh,
closer examination

18:39.194 --> 18:41.694
using X-Ray spectroscopy
to test my theory,

18:41.696 --> 18:44.664
and that's when I found trace
amounts of GSR on the co-pilot.

18:44.666 --> 18:46.099
Which means what?

18:46.101 --> 18:48.401
Petty Officer
Saad is a hero?

18:48.403 --> 18:50.137
At least, he tried to be.

18:50.139 --> 18:51.704
It's not easy to pull
a transport plane

18:51.706 --> 18:53.673
from a dive with two
dead pilots at the stick.

18:53.675 --> 18:55.341
Well, it looks like
we need to do a

18:55.343 --> 18:57.843
deeper dive on our co-pilot,
Varela.

18:57.845 --> 19:00.045
(computer trilling)
What is that?

19:00.047 --> 19:02.014
It's satellite imagery
of the crash site.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.383
I'm trying to get an overview.

19:03.385 --> 19:07.052
You see this, uh--
look at this shadow here.

19:07.054 --> 19:10.355
It keeps moving back and forth
over the crash zone.

19:10.357 --> 19:11.590
Weird, right?

19:11.592 --> 19:13.259
Yeah, what do you think that is?

19:16.197 --> 19:17.696
PRIDE:
<i>A high-altitude</i>

19:17.698 --> 19:19.631
drone, are you sure?

19:20.467 --> 19:22.802
Any idea who it belongs to?

19:23.671 --> 19:24.670
All right, well, just,

19:24.672 --> 19:26.205
keep at it, Sebastian.

19:26.207 --> 19:27.906
Have Christopher and Sonja
head on back.

19:27.908 --> 19:29.240
(phone beeps)
What's a drone doing hovering

19:29.242 --> 19:30.609
over our crash site?

19:30.611 --> 19:32.744
Only one thing:
looking for something.

19:32.746 --> 19:35.314
Yeah, but looking for what?
And who's looking?

19:35.316 --> 19:37.416
All I know is this case keeps
taking more curious turns

19:37.418 --> 19:40.218
all the time. And while we're
chasing our tails,

19:40.220 --> 19:41.553
I just can't shake the feeling
there's something

19:41.555 --> 19:43.121
more going on
than meets the eye.

19:43.123 --> 19:45.423
Yeah. Well, at least we cleared
Petty Officer Saad,

19:45.425 --> 19:46.457
(phone beeps)
that's something.

19:46.459 --> 19:47.758
Especially for Emily.

19:47.760 --> 19:48.827
Maybe not.

19:48.829 --> 19:50.695
News just broke.

19:50.697 --> 19:54.132
Media's blaming Saad
for the crash,

19:54.134 --> 19:56.500
calling him
“a homegrown terrorist”.

19:56.502 --> 19:58.669
That's not true, he's innocent!

19:58.671 --> 20:00.137
Who told the media that?

20:01.006 --> 20:03.140
That's a good question.

20:13.111 --> 20:16.747
NTSB isn't confirming, but
multiple sources have reported

20:16.798 --> 20:18.830
that Navy Petty Officer
Amir Saad

20:18.832 --> 20:20.999
shot the pilots and crashed
the Everglades Air charter...

20:21.001 --> 20:22.600
- Morning.
- Morning.

20:22.602 --> 20:23.835
That's a bunch of bull.

20:23.837 --> 20:26.003
We gotta find out
who those sources are.

20:26.005 --> 20:27.572
Sebastian double-check
his findings yet?

20:27.574 --> 20:28.973
He triple-checked.

20:28.975 --> 20:31.676
Says he's 100% sure
that co-pilot Varela

20:31.678 --> 20:33.445
is the one that
brought down the plane.

20:33.447 --> 20:34.746
So we still don't know
who's trying to pin it

20:34.748 --> 20:36.514
on Petty Officer Saad.

20:36.516 --> 20:39.050
Gotta be someone with
access to the media, drones.

20:39.052 --> 20:41.052
Yeah, well, we better
find out who they are, and fast,

20:41.054 --> 20:42.353
'cause if we don't clear him,

20:42.355 --> 20:43.720
Emily's gonna have
to live with that.

20:43.722 --> 20:45.990
We're not gonna
let that happen, okay?

20:45.992 --> 20:48.225
We're not gonna let anybody
pin this on her father.

20:48.227 --> 20:50.394
First things first--
What'd you find out

20:50.396 --> 20:51.795
about our co-pilot,
Varela?

20:51.797 --> 20:53.564
Possible cartel
connection.

20:53.566 --> 20:54.832
At least with his wife.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.568
Isabel Varela just got
out of surgery

20:57.570 --> 20:59.870
at Clínica De la Paz,
Medellín.

20:59.872 --> 21:00.640
Surgery for what?

21:00.665 --> 21:02.574
Liver transplant Monday.

21:02.575 --> 21:06.076
And then her co-pilots
a suicide run three days later?

21:06.078 --> 21:07.845
It might have something
to do with the fact

21:07.847 --> 21:10.714
that his wife mysteriously
leapfrogged the donor list.

21:10.716 --> 21:11.970
Suddenly got bumped
to the top.

21:12.141 --> 21:14.584
The Natal could absolutely
make that happen.

21:14.586 --> 21:18.188
So Varela ends his life
to save his wife's? Why?

21:18.190 --> 21:21.424
Nobody on the plane
merited a cartel killing.

21:21.426 --> 21:24.594
Do we know what kind
of cargo was on board yet?

21:24.596 --> 21:26.796
Well, apparently
a manifest was filed

21:26.798 --> 21:29.431
before takeoff, but
it suddenly disappeared.

21:29.433 --> 21:30.933
And the cargo that was
found at the crash site

21:30.935 --> 21:32.969
was all but incinerated.

21:32.971 --> 21:35.337
Still, the drone's looking
for <i>something</i> out there.

21:35.339 --> 21:38.808
We find out what, maybe
we'll find out who.

21:38.810 --> 21:42.044
Drone's being controlled
by someone.

21:42.046 --> 21:43.445
Patton's still
out of town, right?

21:43.447 --> 21:44.512
Yeah.

21:44.536 --> 21:45.915
Do you think maybe
the FBI

21:45.916 --> 21:48.617
could, uh...
hack their signal?

21:48.619 --> 21:52.354
U.S. court ruled we can.
So let's.

21:55.893 --> 21:58.193
Gotta give 'em credit.
Whoever's operating this thing,

21:58.195 --> 22:00.862
pretty sophisticated
firewall.

22:00.864 --> 22:04.132
But I can hack into it.

22:06.870 --> 22:08.670
No wonder.

22:08.672 --> 22:10.104
No wonder what?

22:10.106 --> 22:11.372
It's not just <i>a</i> drone,

22:11.374 --> 22:13.542
it's a swarm
of micro-drones.

22:13.544 --> 22:16.077
I thought they were still
in the research stages.

22:16.079 --> 22:17.512
You saying
they belong to us?

22:17.514 --> 22:19.914
Could be NSA, CIA, FSB,

22:19.916 --> 22:21.149
the Chinese-- who knows?

22:21.151 --> 22:22.550
Half our toys
are stolen before

22:22.552 --> 22:24.252
they're even fully
operational now.

22:24.254 --> 22:25.719
Still, this is
pretty high-level.

22:25.721 --> 22:27.655
They're dropped
from high-altitude jets,

22:27.657 --> 22:29.890
parachute open,
then coordinate together.

22:29.892 --> 22:32.360
They're so small, though,
they usually escape detection.

22:32.362 --> 22:34.728
Can you tell us
who's controlling them?

22:34.730 --> 22:36.564
Too many levels
of encryption.

22:36.566 --> 22:38.498
Whoever they are, they don't
want anybody to know

22:38.500 --> 22:40.333
what they're looking for, and
they don't want to be found out.

22:40.335 --> 22:43.236
So what, that's it?
Dead end?

22:44.440 --> 22:45.873
Unless you want to know

22:45.875 --> 22:48.508
where the drones are
transmitting their signals to.

22:48.510 --> 22:49.877
<i>That</i> I can do.

22:49.879 --> 22:52.011
(keyboard clattering)

23:04.826 --> 23:07.026
LASALLE (over radio): Pretty modest
neighborhood to be receiving

23:07.028 --> 23:09.028
encrypted drone signals.

23:09.030 --> 23:11.030
Is your guy sure?

23:11.032 --> 23:13.099
Traced it right
to that van.

23:13.101 --> 23:14.400
PRIDE: We don't know
who's inside the van

23:14.402 --> 23:16.368
or what to expect,
so be careful.

23:16.370 --> 23:17.870
SONJA (over radio):
Copy that.

23:17.872 --> 23:20.272
PRIDE:
Let's go.

23:20.274 --> 23:22.374
NCIS!

23:24.145 --> 23:26.312
GREGORIO: Getting signals,
but nobody's home?

23:31.018 --> 23:33.219
Still hot.
Someone was.

23:33.221 --> 23:35.254
Pride.

23:36.657 --> 23:38.491
PRIDE: CIA.

23:38.493 --> 23:40.859
CIA? What the hell?
Is it their drones?

23:40.861 --> 23:43.228
Any idea what
they're looking for?

23:43.230 --> 23:46.331
GREGORIO:
Yeah. Emily.

23:51.639 --> 23:53.038
(muffled shrieks)

23:53.040 --> 23:55.306
Don't scream.
Nod if you understand.

23:56.709 --> 23:58.610
NCIS!
Don't move.

23:58.612 --> 24:01.179
Wait, the Everglades Air guy?

24:02.115 --> 24:03.681
Last I heard, it's illegal

24:03.683 --> 24:06.651
for CIA to operate on
domestic soil, Mr. Jenkins.

24:09.289 --> 24:10.988
You need to let her go,

24:10.990 --> 24:14.659
and then put your hands
in the air, now.

24:17.630 --> 24:18.829
Come on.

24:35.619 --> 24:37.933
Look, do yourself
a favor.

24:38.033 --> 24:39.533
Just let me go.

24:39.535 --> 24:40.934
You don't want to
get involved with this.

24:40.936 --> 24:42.770
I'm already involved.

24:42.772 --> 24:46.640
So are six grieving families.

24:50.279 --> 24:51.779
I'm Director Isler.

24:51.781 --> 24:54.014
National Security Branch,
FBI.

24:54.016 --> 24:58.484
And you are in violation
of Executive Order 12333.

24:58.486 --> 25:01.154
Which makes it a crime
for CIA operatives

25:01.156 --> 25:04.057
to conduct operations
inside American borders.

25:04.059 --> 25:06.059
I don't know what
you're talking about.

25:06.061 --> 25:07.593
I work for Everglades Air.

25:07.595 --> 25:10.530
Give me a break, that's a CIA
cover-- we all know it.

25:10.532 --> 25:12.398
PRIDE: Prints are all over
the van, Jenkins.

25:12.400 --> 25:14.033
So is your handwriting,
files.

25:14.035 --> 25:16.368
Tell us what you were doing
in Emily Saad's house.

25:16.370 --> 25:18.604
I work for Everglades Air.

25:18.606 --> 25:20.039
You should know that
I placed a call

25:20.041 --> 25:21.607
to my counterpart
at Langley.

25:21.609 --> 25:23.075
How'd that work out for you?

25:25.313 --> 25:27.246
Above your pay grade.
Trust me.

25:27.248 --> 25:28.747
Sounds like
an admission to me.

25:28.749 --> 25:30.615
I'm telling you
you're wasting your time.

25:30.617 --> 25:32.383
And I'm telling you
I don't give a rat's ass

25:32.385 --> 25:35.420
about you or
the damn CIA.

25:35.422 --> 25:38.323
All I care about is what's
going on with that plane crash,

25:38.325 --> 25:40.458
and why you're trying
to turn Petty Officer Saad

25:40.460 --> 25:42.060
into some kind of scapegoat.

25:42.062 --> 25:44.462
Making him look guilty
doesn't just destroy his name,

25:44.464 --> 25:46.064
it destroys
his daughter's, too.

25:46.066 --> 25:49.467
Which begs the question...
why'd you attack her?

25:49.469 --> 25:51.836
I didn't attack her, and I
wasn't going to hurt her either.

25:51.838 --> 25:53.571
Then what were you gonna do?

25:53.573 --> 25:56.173
GREGORIO: We know CIA drones
send signals to your van.

25:56.175 --> 25:58.576
Information gathered
from the site

25:58.578 --> 25:59.777
which obviously had
something to do

25:59.779 --> 26:01.078
with the crash and Saad,

26:01.080 --> 26:04.014
otherwise, you wouldn't
have been there.

26:04.016 --> 26:05.983
PRIDE:
Oh, come on, Jenkins.

26:05.985 --> 26:09.019
What are you looking
so hard to find?

26:11.923 --> 26:15.192
I work for Everglades Air.

26:20.565 --> 26:23.099
Talk about your <i>company</i> man.

26:23.101 --> 26:24.968
Even if we can't
prove he's CIA,

26:24.970 --> 26:26.836
NOPD can hold him
for aggravated assault.

26:26.838 --> 26:28.304
Try and squeeze him
for answers.

26:28.306 --> 26:30.106
It won't work. CIA will
have him out of jail

26:30.108 --> 26:31.941
by the end of the day--
been down that road before.

26:31.943 --> 26:34.443
He never mentioned
Ciudad Natal.

26:34.445 --> 26:35.879
Still think they're
somehow involved?

26:35.881 --> 26:37.146
I don't know how else
to explain

26:37.148 --> 26:39.515
why co-pilot Varela
did what he did.

26:39.517 --> 26:41.717
Still, CIA could have
moved his wife up the donor list

26:41.719 --> 26:43.452
just as easily as Natal.

26:43.454 --> 26:45.488
The best way to find who wanted
to bring down that plane

26:45.490 --> 26:47.856
and why is to find out what
Jenkins wanted

26:47.858 --> 26:49.691
from Saad's daughter.

26:52.963 --> 26:54.429
Drink.

26:56.400 --> 26:59.535
Is Loretta making you
drink that awful tea?

26:59.537 --> 27:01.469
It's not awful,
it's healing.

27:01.471 --> 27:03.438
Be honest.

27:04.441 --> 27:05.841
Sorry.
(chuckles)

27:05.843 --> 27:07.543
Well, perhaps it could use
a little kick.

27:07.545 --> 27:09.912
Well, you know
where it is.

27:11.314 --> 27:12.647
How you holding up?

27:12.649 --> 27:15.216
Head's still spinning.
Sure.

27:15.218 --> 27:17.218
But you should know we think
your father's innocent.

27:17.220 --> 27:18.819
Especially because of you.

27:18.821 --> 27:20.888
We know he came back
to NOLA to make amends,

27:20.890 --> 27:22.290
not take down a plane.

27:22.292 --> 27:25.626
Yeah, well, try telling that
to my friends.

27:25.628 --> 27:27.528
They're already
texting me about it.

27:27.530 --> 27:29.797
It's all over the news.

27:29.799 --> 27:34.068
Add just a little whiskey
and call it a hot toddy.

27:37.106 --> 27:39.840
Whether you know it
or not, Emily,

27:39.842 --> 27:43.343
you have something
that man wanted.

27:43.345 --> 27:45.845
Something that could
blow this case wide open.

27:45.847 --> 27:48.014
You sure you don't have
any ideas?

27:48.016 --> 27:50.817
I wish I could help.
I really do.

27:50.819 --> 27:52.419
It's okay.

27:52.421 --> 27:54.221
We'll take care of it.

27:56.858 --> 27:59.059
We're gonna be searching
your dad's house for a while.

27:59.061 --> 28:01.194
You got someplace
you can stay tonight,

28:01.196 --> 28:04.497
so you won't be alone?

28:04.499 --> 28:06.733
She could stay with me.

28:06.735 --> 28:09.302
Better whiskey there,
anyway.

28:09.304 --> 28:10.470
It might be better
to get her into

28:10.472 --> 28:12.438
an FBI safe house,
you know?

28:12.440 --> 28:14.440
WADE:
You're adorable,

28:14.442 --> 28:17.743
but I can handle
myself just fine, thank you.

28:17.745 --> 28:19.312
Copy that.

28:19.314 --> 28:21.447
Come on, dear.

28:21.449 --> 28:22.948
She's tough.

28:22.950 --> 28:24.283
Trust me,

28:24.285 --> 28:26.152
you do not want
to mess with Miss Loretta.

28:26.154 --> 28:28.654
No, I don't.

28:28.656 --> 28:30.856
LASALLE: I'm telling you,
Percy, more agents are

28:30.858 --> 28:32.925
just gonna
mess things up.

28:32.927 --> 28:34.059
I mean, look at the FBI.

28:34.061 --> 28:35.694
Gregorio is always
complaining

28:35.696 --> 28:38.063

it is over there.

28:38.065 --> 28:39.632

28:39.634 --> 28:42.968

ex-ATF here.

Look, I like what
we got going on, I do.

28:45.139 --> 28:46.672
It's just, a little help

28:46.674 --> 28:48.507
with some of this
leg work wouldn't hurt.

28:48.509 --> 28:49.774
You know what I'm saying?

28:49.776 --> 28:51.843
Well, a hero's work
is never done.

28:53.780 --> 28:56.748
I'm still not even sure
what we're looking for.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.216
I'm not sure, either.

28:58.218 --> 29:00.051
But I'm sure we'll know
when we find it.

29:00.053 --> 29:02.854
The CIA wasn't after Saad's
daughter for no reason.

29:02.856 --> 29:04.489
SEBASTIAN:
Bingo!

29:04.491 --> 29:05.723
You find something?

29:05.725 --> 29:06.958
Uh, no, not much.

29:06.960 --> 29:08.693
Just, uh, what
the CIA was after, so...

29:08.695 --> 29:10.327
I don't want to brag,
but I'm kind of

29:10.329 --> 29:12.063
on a roll here
after last week.

29:12.966 --> 29:15.299
Last week was the prison break?

29:16.636 --> 29:19.070
The one that I...
helped thwart.

29:20.006 --> 29:21.139
No? Okay, it's a tough crowd.

29:21.141 --> 29:23.740
Come on in here.

29:26.979 --> 29:28.812
All right,
so news flash--

29:28.814 --> 29:30.481
the CIA is really good
at what they do.

29:30.483 --> 29:32.483
They managed to locate
a microwave signal

29:32.485 --> 29:33.884
that was transmitted
from the crash site

29:33.886 --> 29:35.118
right after the crash.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.350
Microwave as in cell phone?

29:36.374 --> 29:37.121
Exactly.

29:37.122 --> 29:40.256
Except this signal was sent
from Petty Officer Saad's phone,

29:40.258 --> 29:41.591
then was transmitted
to the cloud

29:41.593 --> 29:43.026
right before the phone,
uh, burned up.

29:43.028 --> 29:44.928
Uh, yeah, De-geek
your speak.

29:44.930 --> 29:47.397
All right, look, every
mobile device these days

29:47.399 --> 29:48.631
connects to the cloud, right?

29:48.633 --> 29:50.000
Which is basically
just a server.

29:50.002 --> 29:52.102
But every file that
gets sent to the cloud

29:52.104 --> 29:53.636
automatically downloads
to every other device

29:53.638 --> 29:55.072
that's part of that account.

29:55.074 --> 29:57.407
Okay, so we're talking
laptops, tablets.

29:57.409 --> 29:59.041
Anything on the family plan,

29:59.043 --> 30:01.544
including desktops.

30:01.546 --> 30:03.779
So cell to cloud
to family desktop?

30:03.781 --> 30:05.281
Right. But even if the CIA
could delete

30:05.283 --> 30:07.217
whatever was sent
to Saad's cloud file,

30:07.219 --> 30:09.319
the only way to erase
all the evidence

30:09.321 --> 30:11.521
would be to delete
all the backup hard drives, too.

30:11.523 --> 30:13.889
Which brings us back
to Mr. Desktop here.

30:13.891 --> 30:16.064

I'm on a roll. Check this out.

30:56.432 --> 30:57.465
Any idea who it is?

30:57.467 --> 30:59.500
GREGORIO:
I think I might know.

31:00.570 --> 31:02.035
Osiel Esparza,

31:02.037 --> 31:05.105
chief accountant
to the Ciudad Natal.

31:07.477 --> 31:10.144
He knows the structure
of the entire organization.

31:10.146 --> 31:11.345
FBI's been working with

31:11.347 --> 31:12.946
regional authorities
for years

31:12.948 --> 31:14.382
to try and locate him.

31:14.384 --> 31:16.083
So, it looks like Isler
was right after all,

31:16.085 --> 31:18.152
this <i>is</i> about the cartel.

31:18.154 --> 31:20.420
CIA wants the same win
and got Esparza first.

31:20.422 --> 31:22.189
They must have been
bringing him in.

31:22.191 --> 31:24.992
Except, somehow Natal
found out about it first,

31:24.994 --> 31:27.094
and they got the co-pilot
to crash the plane

31:27.096 --> 31:29.129
before they could.
Yeah. Here's the thing.

31:29.131 --> 31:31.165
Six bodies were recovered
from the crash,

31:31.167 --> 31:33.200
and all were identified, so...

31:33.202 --> 31:34.867
Where's Esparza?

31:34.869 --> 31:36.469
He must've survived.

31:36.471 --> 31:39.739
Which means the CIA drones
are looking for him.

31:39.741 --> 31:42.241
GREGORIO: Cartel's probably
looking for him, too.

31:42.243 --> 31:44.076
I mean, CIA's obviously
got a leak, otherwise Natal

31:44.078 --> 31:46.279
wouldn't have known
to turn the co-pilot.

31:46.281 --> 31:48.114
The bayou's rough terrain.

31:48.116 --> 31:50.717
Esparza won't last long
out there either way.

31:50.719 --> 31:52.718
But if we don't find him first
and clear

31:52.720 --> 31:53.718
Petty Officer Saad's name...

31:53.742 --> 31:54.922
PRIDE:
He'll take the fall,

31:54.923 --> 31:57.456
and Emily's gonna
have to live with it.

38:29.579 --> 38:32.180
I didn't even know
who I was yet.

38:32.182 --> 38:33.814
Last I heard,

38:33.816 --> 38:35.816
McKinley's still on the run.

38:35.818 --> 38:37.518
Yep.

38:37.520 --> 38:39.319
Me, too, in my own way.

38:41.056 --> 38:44.224
Couldn't get out of NOLA
fast enough afterwards.

38:45.395 --> 38:48.429
Took back my maiden name.

38:50.432 --> 38:53.100
(softly):
I'm sorry.

38:54.169 --> 38:55.869
I'm gonna go.

38:58.274 --> 39:00.173
Aren't you tired
of running?

39:02.011 --> 39:04.577
(exhales)

39:05.714 --> 39:08.448
Yes, I am.

39:10.218 --> 39:11.918
The problem is,
everywhere I turn,

39:11.920 --> 39:14.788
I see what my husband
did to this place.

39:14.790 --> 39:17.857
So, what, you up
and joined the FBI?

39:17.859 --> 39:19.592
Make amends for
what he did?

39:19.594 --> 39:22.694
Yeah. Something like that.

39:24.532 --> 39:28.100
So, what, you're gonna
tell the others, now?

39:29.170 --> 39:31.870
Not my story to tell.

39:31.872 --> 39:34.173
But you should know...

39:34.175 --> 39:37.143
NOLA's been through
a lot more than just...

39:37.145 --> 39:38.477
Katrina. It's...

39:38.479 --> 39:42.213
a pretty forgiving city,
if you let it be.

39:44.552 --> 39:47.820
Take my word for it.
