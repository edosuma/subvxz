Listen!

40:29.102 --> 40:32.136
Listen to me, please.

40:32.635 --> 40:35.301
Once we're together again, we'll...

40:37.902 --> 40:41.136
I... I don't believe that.

40:43.802 --> 40:45.901
Lloyd, I have told you.

40:45.902 --> 40:47.601
It's all decided about Georgie.

41:55.735 --> 41:58.834
I've just had another
peek in the nursery.

41:58.835 --> 42:00.501
Why are you still here?

42:00.502 --> 42:02.501
I wanted to reassure you that this...

42:02.502 --> 42:04.401
this breathing issue
seems to be improving.

42:04.402 --> 42:07.367
It isn't just a breathing issue.

42:07.368 --> 42:09.968
If it's HMD or pulmonary hypoplasia,

42:09.969 --> 42:14.367
25% of premature babies at his
stage die in the first week.

42:14.368 --> 42:15.868
Well, I heard the nurse telling Jack

42:15.869 --> 42:18.634
that he's been breathing on his
own for the past half an hour...

42:18.635 --> 42:20.435
off the ventilator.

42:21.102 --> 42:22.167
What do you need?

42:22.168 --> 42:23.634
For you to go.

42:23.635 --> 42:26.268
Jack's doing his rounds.
He'll be here soon.

42:29.902 --> 42:31.802
Have you thought of a name yet?

42:34.835 --> 42:36.335
No.

42:37.568 --> 42:40.301
And he'll be Nordmann on
the birth certificate.

42:41.902 --> 42:44.635
- That's not why I asked.
- Of course it is.

42:45.568 --> 42:49.634
What you truly care about is
that on paper he's a Bligh.

42:49.635 --> 42:51.300
A bastard Bligh is better than none,

42:51.301 --> 42:54.168
but not in my books, as you well know.

42:58.335 --> 43:00.367
I didn't come here to upset you.

I'm trying to do the right thing by her.

But my name <i>should</i> be on
the birth certificate.

43:26.102 --> 43:28.901
Your timing is appalling, George.

43:28.902 --> 43:31.701
I don't want to adopt my
own child after we marry.

43:31.702 --> 43:33.234
<i>If</i> you marry.

43:33.235 --> 43:35.802
Let's not forget, this
was the child that...

43:36.602 --> 43:37.934
that she wanted to abort.

43:37.935 --> 43:39.601
Oh, please.

43:39.602 --> 43:41.701
It would simply put him...

43:41.702 --> 43:44.568
it would put us on a good
footing for the future.

43:45.201 --> 43:47.567
I understand that... that she's worried

43:47.568 --> 43:49.634
that the child would be
labeled illegitimate.

43:49.635 --> 43:51.635
And that is a very real concern.

43:52.168 --> 43:54.801
It would affect him his whole life.

the Jewish community.

44:00.502 --> 44:02.635
All of that I understand.

44:03.635 --> 44:05.768
Must the child be Jewish?

44:05.769 --> 44:07.501
Apparently yes.

44:07.502 --> 44:09.501
Not that I have a say in that, either.

44:09.502 --> 44:12.835
It's all rather a... a one-way street.

44:17.702 --> 44:21.969
Perhaps we, uh... we
should go our own ways.

44:23.402 --> 44:27.235
W-Why not take this one day at a time?

44:30.602 --> 44:31.635
Regina was right.

44:32.635 --> 44:34.968
I should have stayed in Canberra.

44:34.969 --> 44:36.934
She should not be involved in this.

For all of Regina's
shortcomings, Mother,

44:40.136 --> 44:43.335
her advice over the past couple
of months has been exemplary.

44:43.969 --> 44:45.835
I can't fault her in that.

44:46.368 --> 44:49.567
And her expertise in
policy negotiations,

44:49.568 --> 44:52.835
quite frankly, has been invaluable.

to her apparent charms.

know what we do...

the child doesn't survive,
