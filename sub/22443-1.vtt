01:42.689 --> 01:44.191
Do you want to run away?

01:45.160 --> 01:46.566
Sometimes I...

01:46.923 --> 01:48.445
I think about escape.

01:49.132 --> 01:50.250
From what?

01:51.031 --> 01:52.480
Everything.

01:53.599 --> 01:54.542
Life.

01:55.906 --> 01:57.287
What would you do?

01:58.416 --> 01:59.729
I don't know.

02:01.113 --> 02:02.586
Nothing maybe.

02:03.555 --> 02:04.944
That's legitimate.

02:05.291 --> 02:07.613
Is it legitimate... to hide?

02:07.824 --> 02:09.247
I'm not hiding.

02:10.377 --> 02:13.189
Nobody knows you're here
seeing me today, do they?

02:15.900 --> 02:18.443
Perhaps you're trying to
sabotage your own life.

02:19.192 --> 02:21.323
- Fuck you.
- No, fuck you.

02:27.883 --> 02:30.022
Change the subject, please.

02:33.313 --> 02:35.106
What about your family,

02:35.485 --> 02:37.262
if you went...

02:37.776 --> 02:39.199
Went where?

02:39.666 --> 02:41.132
A desert island.

02:42.229 --> 02:43.942
Under the wheels of a train.

02:45.003 --> 02:45.866
Jean.

02:46.324 --> 02:47.639
Your family.

02:48.663 --> 02:51.270
They're young. They'd adapt. I did.

02:51.291 --> 02:52.731
Look how you turned out.

02:53.091 --> 02:55.962
- Again, fuck you.
- Very defensive.

02:56.919 --> 02:58.320
No, I'm not.

03:00.719 --> 03:02.889
Did you see any dead people today?

03:05.983 --> 03:07.638
Wanna talk about it?

03:13.152 --> 03:14.470
I had

03:14.938 --> 03:17.289
a great fucking day.

03:21.844 --> 03:23.454
You, cleaning guy.

03:23.574 --> 03:24.671
Sorry.

03:25.441 --> 03:27.639
- Who is he?
- Some maintenance.

03:27.680 --> 03:29.999
Iraqi, Turkish, something.

03:30.270 --> 03:32.169
Just sign at the bottom, please.

03:34.550 --> 03:37.120
Isn't this an outrageous amount
of money for a bit of mopping up.

03:37.131 --> 03:40.280
Well, your jumper fell
eight floors, head first.

03:40.400 --> 03:41.615
Big impact.

03:41.735 --> 03:44.856
Blood borne pathogens, brain
matter, skull fragments,

03:44.873 --> 03:46.696
hair, teeth, feces.

03:46.816 --> 03:49.080
10 meter radius. 15 maybe.

03:49.440 --> 03:52.910
A breeding ground for disease:
hep B and C, HIV, God forbid...

03:57.153 --> 03:58.570
Why did he jump?

03:59.287 --> 04:00.526
Who gives a shit?

04:03.700 --> 04:05.040
Here you go.

04:51.094 --> 04:53.274
Do you think you're obsessed with death?

04:54.983 --> 04:57.135
I've been near it all my life.

04:57.885 --> 04:59.079
Seen it.

05:00.920 --> 05:02.875
It impacts on everybody around.

05:03.092 --> 05:05.560
You're not responsible for everybody.

05:08.331 --> 05:11.362
- I said, you're not responsible for everybody.
- I heard you.

05:12.080 --> 05:14.749
- I'm not sure this is working for me.
- Why do you have a mistress?

05:19.355 --> 05:21.462
I wouldn't call her a "mistress".

05:22.130 --> 05:23.545
What would you call her?

05:26.335 --> 05:28.500
- A woman.
- Your wife's a woman.

05:29.330 --> 05:31.058
My wife's a great woman.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.859
So why do you fuck the mistress?

05:34.450 --> 05:35.960
Is she

05:36.029 --> 05:37.216
a trophy?

05:39.003 --> 05:42.412
- A reward for all your success?
- I don't think of people like that.

05:44.860 --> 05:46.249
She's...

05:48.120 --> 05:50.386
- a secret.
- A damaging secret.

05:52.267 --> 05:53.124
Maybe.

05:54.351 --> 05:56.093
You keep a lot of secrets.

05:57.192 --> 05:59.000
I don't want to talk about me anymore.

05:59.751 --> 06:01.152
Let's talk about you.

06:07.177 --> 06:08.265
What do you wanna know?

06:13.531 --> 06:15.383
What's going on in your head right now?

06:19.226 --> 06:20.997
I'm thinking...

06:22.843 --> 06:24.770
I'm tired of this game.

06:25.587 --> 06:27.802
And I want to fuck your right now.

06:31.153 --> 06:32.438
I'm thinking

06:32.785 --> 06:35.673
you might be the second
best lover I've ever had.

06:39.560 --> 06:41.000
Second best?

06:41.605 --> 06:43.949
- Well, not so bad.
- I don't know.

06:44.297 --> 06:45.882
It's a very short list.

06:48.487 --> 06:50.392
You're a little  passive-aggressive today.

06:50.440 --> 06:52.278
I get like that when I'm horny.

07:20.920 --> 07:22.547
Maybe you should consider a real therapy.

07:22.572 --> 07:23.871
_

07:23.880 --> 07:24.862
Seriously.

07:25.920 --> 07:26.973
I have to go.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.636
Run along then.

07:29.880 --> 07:31.238
Do you have a shift right now?

07:31.585 --> 07:34.321
I work in a shop. If I lose
this job I'll get another one.

07:35.113 --> 07:36.192
That simple, uh?

07:36.613 --> 07:39.924
I owe nothing. I own nothing.
And I'm free as a bird.

07:40.613 --> 07:42.554
Work to live, baby. Don't live to work.

07:46.999 --> 07:47.790
Go on.

07:48.045 --> 07:49.911
Run along. Bills to pay.

07:56.534 --> 07:58.903
Body has lain inside all summer.

07:58.931 --> 08:01.001
It's a full-mask job.

08:02.205 --> 08:03.507
A hundred years from now,

08:03.536 --> 08:07.015
Lady Gaga will be mentioned in the
same breath as Mozart or Beethoven.

08:07.038 --> 08:10.169
- She's a fucking dancer who got lucky.
- She's an icon!

08:10.187 --> 08:11.989
Her face looks like my foot.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.949
If we're gonna start judging
people on how they look,

08:13.966 --> 08:15.070
you better duck for cover.

08:15.100 --> 08:17.421
You're discriminating against
people of the ginger persuasion.

08:17.440 --> 08:19.308
Don't talk to me about discrimination, man.

08:19.360 --> 08:20.378
You're pulling the black card.

08:20.390 --> 08:22.346
The Irish were the original blacks.

08:22.577 --> 08:24.560
The blacks were the original blacks.

08:24.680 --> 08:25.951
Old man,

08:26.235 --> 08:29.088
died in the armchair. Been there 7 weeks.

08:29.679 --> 08:31.415
Postman noticed the smell.

08:31.913 --> 08:33.904
- Bodily fluids pulled inside the chair.

08:33.933 --> 08:36.022
- Leakage to the carpet and sub floor.

08:36.090 --> 08:38.238
Rodents have been at him on the right side.

08:38.626 --> 08:39.852
Ring finger.

08:40.264 --> 08:41.363
What remains of it.

08:42.075 --> 08:43.590
Fucking rats!

08:43.799 --> 08:45.108
The chair goes,

08:45.400 --> 08:47.550
this whole section of
carpet up to the wall.

08:48.407 --> 08:50.334
skirting, get a mini-skip.

08:50.971 --> 08:52.858
Do we really have to do the sub floor?

08:53.442 --> 08:55.613
- It's a condemned house.
- This was someone's life.

08:55.636 --> 08:56.909
Show some respect.

09:44.751 --> 09:46.013
I'm really sorry.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.656
I was so busy.

09:47.917 --> 09:49.618
I couldn't just drop everything, you know.

09:50.486 --> 09:51.915
You know why we're here?

09:51.921 --> 09:54.062
Maddy, us, all these
people? Why are we all here?

09:55.156 --> 09:57.465
Uh, 'cause it's a great school,

09:57.489 --> 09:59.370
and we want Maddy to get in.

10:00.747 --> 10:03.073
- And, school is important.
- No, fuck you,

10:03.090 --> 10:04.830
you don't get to be the
fun one. You were late.

10:04.861 --> 10:06.609
And it was me standing like
an idiot in the corridor,

10:06.632 --> 10:08.745
because both parents have to
be present for the interview.

10:08.760 --> 10:11.160
- Let's go now.
- No, they're done for the day.

10:11.280 --> 10:12.472
I'll talk to them.

10:13.080 --> 10:15.337
- You know what, it's our last
chance. You fucked it up before.

10:15.355 --> 10:17.430
- Oh, come on.
- You did, Dad, you fucked up.

10:17.490 --> 10:18.441
Maddy!

10:18.989 --> 10:21.350
I'm really, really sorry.

10:21.703 --> 10:24.198
I know they want to see commitment
from parents, I get that.

10:25.610 --> 10:28.440
Well, I told you had an
unforeseen emergency. But...

10:28.560 --> 10:30.101
we need to make an impression.

10:30.130 --> 10:32.682
You know, the sooner we make the
music room donation, the better.

10:33.160 --> 10:33.960
What?

10:34.303 --> 10:37.370
They're raising funds for a new
music room. We agreed Â£2,000.

10:38.453 --> 10:40.674
- That's now?
- When did you think it was?

10:40.675 --> 10:42.255
- Kendrick: Meet me at the bar in 45min.
-  I don't know.

10:42.375 --> 10:44.230
- Now?
- Yes, fucking now! What are you doing?

10:44.350 --> 10:47.129
- I gotta go. I can't cancel this guy.
- No no no. Come on, no!

10:47.152 --> 10:48.541
OK, uh...

10:48.784 --> 10:49.728
Two grand?

11:27.450 --> 11:28.598
Maureen ?

11:30.940 --> 11:34.268
- Is that it?
- Unless they've cloned themselves.

11:34.974 --> 11:36.592
Well, it's not enough.

11:36.837 --> 11:39.450
I can't pay what I need to pay with this.

11:40.275 --> 11:43.006
Could I top off of personal funds.

11:43.386 --> 11:47.329
You may have less in your
personal account than you think.

11:58.640 --> 12:01.800
- Everybody's going.
- Well, you're not.

12:01.969 --> 12:03.645
It's just a sleepover.

12:03.816 --> 12:06.734
Alcohol, boys, and God knows what else.

12:06.800 --> 12:08.310
God you're so annoying.

12:08.331 --> 12:09.952
It's my job to be annoying.

12:10.030 --> 12:11.280
There's a man in the kitchen.

12:11.443 --> 12:12.355
What?

12:13.583 --> 12:14.674
Stay here.

12:27.805 --> 12:30.617
Two-rounds single malt,
Detective Inspector.

12:33.764 --> 12:35.870
Why do you bother drinking?

12:35.871 --> 12:36.989
You're terrible at it.

12:36.990 --> 12:40.436
Bullshit. I love this fucking...

12:41.107 --> 12:44.335
distilled engine oil you cops drink.

12:45.221 --> 12:46.790
It's a little light.

12:47.437 --> 12:50.313
I'll make it up to you.
Temporary cash flow.

12:50.433 --> 12:52.655
- You know I'm good for it.
- It's not that.

12:54.391 --> 12:58.400
There's a mandatory renegotiation
of all procurement contracts.

12:58.406 --> 13:00.450
- Internal audit, best practice..
- Tom...

13:00.456 --> 13:04.096
- Come on, English is my second language.
- They're canceling your contract.

13:06.997 --> 13:09.514
- They can't do that!
- They can do what they want, John.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.013
They're the fucking police.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.185
You're invited to bid on a

13:14.305 --> 13:17.240
- job by job basis.
- You're a senior officer. Stop them!

13:17.600 --> 13:20.520
I'm a DCI. Decisions like
that are above my head.

13:21.054 --> 13:23.760
Accounts, business affairs...

13:23.776 --> 13:26.818
The value of each contract will drop 40%.

13:26.823 --> 13:28.588
Maybe even 2/3.

13:28.708 --> 13:31.301
40% kills us.

13:31.583 --> 13:33.270
We won't even cover costs.

13:54.360 --> 13:55.296
You all right, John?

13:56.309 --> 13:57.431
Of course.

13:57.752 --> 13:59.760
I have a lust for life.

14:00.628 --> 14:02.520
You know how the French are.

14:02.760 --> 14:04.209
You still good for the rest, yeah?

14:04.933 --> 14:06.316
Absolutely.

14:35.679 --> 14:39.000
Yeah, I train on Saturdays,
and I play on Sundays.

14:39.025 --> 14:41.119
You do? What are you good at?

14:41.239 --> 14:42.320
I like sport.

14:42.370 --> 14:44.920
- Sport? What kind of sport?
- Tennis is fun.

14:44.967 --> 14:47.630
- Hey, brother!
- Dad! Look who's here?

14:48.163 --> 14:49.940
Look who's come to visit.

14:50.060 --> 14:52.638
Surprise! Shocked you?

14:53.769 --> 14:55.234
Yeah, you shocked me.

14:57.023 --> 14:59.224
Told you, didn't I? Like a carp.

15:00.810 --> 15:04.752
- So, how... how did you?
- He came in through the little window.

15:05.088 --> 15:06.883
You know, the one that you
said doesn't need fixing.

15:06.894 --> 15:09.325
I was like 80% sure it was the right house.

15:09.371 --> 15:10.598
Look at this one.

15:11.402 --> 15:13.914
How could a supermodel like this

15:15.396 --> 15:18.902
come from an ugly old man
like you? Look at his face.

15:20.558 --> 15:21.837
Look at his nose.

15:22.167 --> 15:23.720
He can't be your real father.

15:23.723 --> 15:25.552
Get a DNA test!

15:26.269 --> 15:27.640
And you didn't tell me

15:27.880 --> 15:30.818
we had a real life superhero in the family.

15:30.876 --> 15:32.763
Did you leap any tall buildings today?

15:32.792 --> 15:34.100
Save any babies?

15:34.806 --> 15:36.560
Very smart!

15:36.601 --> 15:39.200
Always keep your real identity secret.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.328
And remember

15:40.448 --> 15:43.350
only rescue rich and beautiful women.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.151
I like your family.

15:48.534 --> 15:49.669
Yeah, me too.

15:50.360 --> 15:53.100
So, when... how did you get here?

15:54.009 --> 15:55.033
I drove.

15:55.340 --> 15:56.347
Le Renault ?

15:56.671 --> 15:57.834
Cool, right?

15:58.766 --> 15:59.964
Retro.

16:00.542 --> 16:01.920
What are your plans?

16:02.417 --> 16:04.947
A holiday. Change of scene.

16:05.607 --> 16:07.240
Seven years is too long.

16:07.610 --> 16:08.564
And you,

16:08.975 --> 16:10.272
haven't changed a bit.

16:19.567 --> 16:22.497
We... we didn't have a shower.

16:23.018 --> 16:25.480
So every Sunday, it was a bath.

16:25.507 --> 16:27.779
Well, I'm the older brother
so I use the water first.

16:27.793 --> 16:29.110
And what I would do,

16:29.320 --> 16:33.190
- I would peak a little piss in the water...
- OK, you know what? It's bed time!

16:33.226 --> 16:34.637
Mom, it's Friday!

16:35.000 --> 16:36.840
- It's so bed time.
- I can't say "piss"?

16:36.862 --> 16:38.291
Say goodnight to your uncle.

16:38.915 --> 16:40.981
- Good night, Uncle Martin.
- Good night, buddy.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.640
- Night.
- Faster, faster.

16:46.307 --> 16:47.597
Can I leave you to clear up?

16:55.400 --> 16:58.155
- Something wrong?
- Nah, just wondering if you

16:58.164 --> 17:01.085
hang your balls by the door
when you come in from work.

17:04.674 --> 17:06.212
I know it

17:06.332 --> 17:08.925
won't have reached the VendÃ©e, or

17:09.680 --> 17:10.839
Napoli, or

17:11.125 --> 17:12.599
wherever you've been lately...

17:12.849 --> 17:13.665
Jail?

17:16.760 --> 17:18.875
But you know, it's the 21st century

17:18.893 --> 17:20.143
in the rest of the world.

17:21.063 --> 17:21.964
Outside.

17:22.569 --> 17:23.574
Out.

17:34.320 --> 17:35.320
What's going on?

17:38.541 --> 17:39.907
I had to take a trip.

17:41.122 --> 17:41.961
Why?

17:44.440 --> 17:46.169
Stayed too long in one place.

17:50.527 --> 17:51.708
You in trouble?

17:53.331 --> 17:54.651
Always.

18:07.483 --> 18:09.165
You got a nice life.

18:17.379 --> 18:19.404
You ever think about Mom?

18:20.652 --> 18:22.705
- No.
- I do.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.230
More as I get older.

18:25.237 --> 18:28.855
- I'm not getting sentimental over this.
- She is in the hospital.

18:30.627 --> 18:33.485
- Sometimes she remembers.
- I'm through with that.

18:33.747 --> 18:35.360
I went to the house.

18:36.314 --> 18:37.987
It's suffering.

18:40.061 --> 18:41.830
The roof needs attention.

18:42.413 --> 18:44.710
Don't tell me you don't think about it.

18:48.608 --> 18:50.416
You can stay the week-end,

18:51.257 --> 18:53.482
play happy families.

18:54.730 --> 18:56.729
Then I need you to go.

19:07.650 --> 19:08.945
I'm sorry.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.960
He'll be gone by Monday.

19:10.981 --> 19:12.889
I can get through a couple days.

19:14.365 --> 19:16.028
He can stay longer,

19:16.291 --> 19:18.850
if you want to... build bridges

19:21.328 --> 19:23.227
When we were kids,

19:23.673 --> 19:25.400
my mom has this belt,

19:25.520 --> 19:26.800
an old one,

19:27.194 --> 19:29.600
my grandfather's I think.

19:30.558 --> 19:32.927
It hanged on the back of the kitchen door.

19:34.249 --> 19:36.085
Anytime we did something bad,

19:36.526 --> 19:38.000
she'd beat us with it.

19:39.123 --> 19:41.067
I'd fall in the corner,

19:41.791 --> 19:43.120
on my back.

19:44.151 --> 19:45.880
Pull myself up into a ball,

19:46.000 --> 19:47.569
a smaller target.

19:49.958 --> 19:52.481
Martin would just stand there, and take it.

19:54.371 --> 19:56.578
She'd hit him, hit him.

19:57.561 --> 19:58.890
He wouldn't fall.

19:59.664 --> 20:01.020
He was brave.

20:01.373 --> 20:04.249
He always wanted to be
the little big man for her.

20:05.377 --> 20:07.160
Ådipe bullshit.

20:11.933 --> 20:13.280
Why has he come?

20:14.213 --> 20:15.624
He's out of options.

20:16.547 --> 20:17.822
Needs my help.

20:18.916 --> 20:20.164
What help?

20:21.675 --> 20:23.185
I don't know yet.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.289
You know, he had an
erection in the kitchen.

20:31.409 --> 20:33.240
After dinner, when I was making coffee.

20:34.132 --> 20:35.520
Are you sure?

20:35.640 --> 20:38.680
Either that or he needs to see a
doctor. I don't know, the whole time

20:38.690 --> 20:40.320
he was standing at the counter,

20:40.440 --> 20:45.075
insisting only French know how to make
decent coffee, with a huge erection.

20:45.677 --> 20:48.598
- Maybe he didn't know.
- Oh, he fucking knew.

21:49.561 --> 21:51.120
What the fuck are you doing?

21:51.240 --> 21:52.355
Nothing.

21:53.121 --> 21:55.320
I'm just trying to get my
freezer inside the garage.

21:55.440 --> 21:57.709
- It's the middle of the night!
- I know.

21:58.713 --> 22:01.037
I have a generator in
the van, it broke down.

22:01.055 --> 22:04.102
And, these things are maybe
good for 10h without power.

22:04.222 --> 22:06.160
- What? Your ice-cream is melting?
- No.

22:06.173 --> 22:08.080
I have a little problem.

22:09.914 --> 22:11.720
Maybe not that little.

22:16.602 --> 22:18.429
She was a drug mule.

22:19.686 --> 22:21.504
What the fuck?!

22:22.250 --> 22:25.180
I used shrimp to cover
the body inside the boat.

22:25.596 --> 22:28.400
We better get her inside
quick, I think she's defrosting.

22:28.436 --> 22:30.977
No! No! No! No!

22:31.023 --> 22:33.021
Come on, we're already halfway!

22:33.040 --> 22:35.173
It's not a matter of distance!

22:35.409 --> 22:37.352
- Take it back!
- Not "it".

22:38.419 --> 22:41.692
- Her name was Lydia.
- What is going on?

22:44.866 --> 22:46.160
Nothing, Gareth.

22:46.177 --> 22:49.315
It's me, Jean. My brother is visiting.

22:49.435 --> 22:51.629
I'm helping him move.

22:51.828 --> 22:54.080
- This is his freezer.
- It's 3AM!

22:54.120 --> 22:56.857
I'm on a conference call
to the Far East at 7!

22:56.880 --> 22:57.598
Sorry.

22:57.625 --> 23:00.570
Then stop moaning like a
little bitch and go to bed.

23:01.152 --> 23:02.997
Lorraine, call the police.

23:03.358 --> 23:04.896
Just fucking do it!

23:05.483 --> 23:07.753
We'll see how you like
that, you French prick!

23:07.771 --> 23:09.516
Damn right I'm a French prick!

23:09.636 --> 23:12.280
You know what? Your wife might life it!

23:12.301 --> 23:14.000
Hey, Lorraine!

23:14.250 --> 23:16.325
What? Why?

23:16.445 --> 23:20.330
- You've got a dead body!
- No, now, we've got a dead body.

23:22.328 --> 23:24.598
Listen, I've been to jail.

23:24.607 --> 23:26.960
You wouldn't make it. You're too pretty.

23:32.095 --> 23:33.316
Fuck!

23:33.605 --> 23:35.233
Wait! Stop!

23:35.568 --> 23:37.400
We're making noise.

23:37.520 --> 23:38.497
Pull!

23:49.729 --> 23:52.270
God, your neighbor is such an asshole.

23:52.970 --> 23:54.240
Should we be worried about the police?

23:54.360 --> 23:56.200
How the fuck should I know?

23:56.431 --> 23:58.104
You better start explaining.

23:58.347 --> 24:00.040
Well, it's not that complicated.

24:00.280 --> 24:03.149
Some very bad people in St-Nazaire
owe me money. A lot of money.

24:07.334 --> 24:10.440
- You killed their drug mule?
- No, she was already dead.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.241
But why should I give her to
them when they stole from me?

24:13.680 --> 24:15.376
But the drug is still inside?

24:15.593 --> 24:16.895
Yes.

24:17.015 --> 24:19.834
Heroin. A lot.

24:19.954 --> 24:21.536
I want you to cut her open,

24:21.560 --> 24:23.273
get the drugs out.

24:23.481 --> 24:27.052
I sell it. I get my money, and go.

24:28.044 --> 24:29.753
I froze her up as soon as I could.

24:29.873 --> 24:32.760
I don't know nothing about biology,

24:33.330 --> 24:34.966
dead bodies is your thing.

24:35.301 --> 24:37.829
- Dead bodies are not my thing!
- Yes it is. That's what you do.

24:37.838 --> 24:38.959
No, it's not!

24:39.230 --> 24:41.554
I have a crime scene cleaning business.

24:42.033 --> 24:44.560
We attend incidents after the police leave.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.066
The bodies are gone.

24:46.508 --> 24:49.700
We only remove risk of
infection, contamination.

24:49.820 --> 24:51.066
We clean.

24:51.598 --> 24:53.240
That's a real job?

24:55.052 --> 24:56.360
Yes, it is.

24:57.078 --> 24:59.772
You know, the last thing a
grieving family wants to do is

24:59.892 --> 25:02.760
wipe the remains of their
loved one off the walls.

25:03.227 --> 25:05.596
You know, vacuum their
guts out of the carpet.

25:05.641 --> 25:08.870
So you're not a CSI, laser
beams, ballistics and shit?

25:08.880 --> 25:10.714
I'm a crime scene cleaner.

25:11.094 --> 25:13.370
Mops, and bleach, and shit.

25:17.343 --> 25:19.866
Well, it doesn't matter.
You need to help me.

25:20.480 --> 25:23.015
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do, I have nowhere else.

25:24.408 --> 25:28.052
You brought a dead body into my home.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.253
That changes everything.

25:34.716 --> 25:36.597
Be gone by the morning.

25:39.328 --> 25:40.992
God.

25:48.380 --> 25:49.760
Rooney!

26:13.058 --> 26:15.536
You parked on a resident spot.

26:15.656 --> 26:17.846
Everything I own was in that van.

26:18.152 --> 26:19.626
My clothes,

26:20.303 --> 26:21.705
my board,

26:21.940 --> 26:23.179
my weed.

26:23.704 --> 26:25.476
You brought weed across the border?

26:26.117 --> 26:30.051
Well, I thought if they found a dead
body, they would let the weed slide.

26:30.530 --> 26:33.306
I loved that fucking
board. I had it 15 years.

26:33.320 --> 26:36.080
Now, I'm sorry you lost
your little skateboard,

26:36.200 --> 26:40.242
but you'll excuse me if the dead body with
all the drugs inside is still my priority!

26:43.561 --> 26:45.233
You need to help me.

26:47.395 --> 26:50.840
- I need money. I need money now!
- I need money too.

26:53.236 --> 26:55.400
- Fuck you! You think I own all this?
- Yeah.

26:55.406 --> 26:58.173
I don't own anything. The bank does!

26:58.761 --> 27:00.640
The bank owns the house,

27:00.643 --> 27:02.560
the clothes on my kids' backs!

27:03.527 --> 27:06.566
Well, we have the money right here.

27:07.054 --> 27:08.600
You don't understand that?

27:08.720 --> 27:10.882
The money is right here, right now,

27:10.900 --> 27:13.025
- inside Lydia.
- Whoa, hey! Hey!

27:14.002 --> 27:16.009
I don't want you to do anything!

27:16.299 --> 27:17.420
All right?

27:19.165 --> 27:20.774
Let me figure this out.

27:27.336 --> 27:28.680
Take it.

27:29.212 --> 27:30.966
You're a very important man.

27:45.130 --> 27:47.768
How can you be in this
job and be afraid of rats?

27:48.121 --> 27:49.170
They're sinister.

27:49.290 --> 27:51.765
They go around in gangs rounding
people with switch blades now?

27:51.800 --> 27:53.239
Everybody's got something.

27:53.359 --> 27:55.715
I can't do underground. Claustrophobic.

27:55.835 --> 27:57.668
Thank god I don't pay
you a lot by the hour.

27:57.901 --> 28:00.090
Sitting around, praying for death, Chief.

28:00.307 --> 28:02.341
- Job
- I'll take it.

28:02.674 --> 28:04.646
That way I don't have to pay anyone.

28:19.688 --> 28:21.108
You have a...

28:21.587 --> 28:23.713
a lovely home. I'm sorry to disturb it.

28:23.922 --> 28:26.070
It's fine. There's no disturbance.

28:27.484 --> 28:30.694
I thought I would apologize, since
you like to control things so much.

28:30.720 --> 28:32.160
I don't like to control things.

28:33.136 --> 28:34.653
You seem a little uptight.

28:34.689 --> 28:36.015
Well, I'm not.

28:36.016 --> 28:39.695
- Well, it's cool, you know, sometimes, it's OK to let go.
- Oh, I know.

28:44.787 --> 28:46.586
Just wanted to apologize.

29:31.990 --> 29:33.916
Hi. Everything all right?

29:33.952 --> 29:35.246
Yeah.

29:36.032 --> 29:37.760
Is that cement?

29:37.880 --> 29:39.720
Brain matter.

29:40.581 --> 29:43.927
When it dries, the texture is
a little like plaster of Paris.

30:36.872 --> 30:39.360
- Are you working?
- Yeah, I'm almost done.

30:39.610 --> 30:41.000
What are you up to?

30:41.120 --> 30:42.705
Job applications.

30:43.465 --> 30:44.720
Anything good?

30:44.960 --> 30:46.086
Not really.

30:46.674 --> 30:48.293
We got a letter from the school.

30:48.709 --> 30:51.440
- Maddy is on the reserve list.
- That's great.

30:52.272 --> 30:54.866
- Isn't it?
-  I know they're holding off.

30:54.986 --> 30:57.010
The sooner we make the
donation, the better.

30:58.275 --> 31:01.585
I'm on it. Definitely next week.

31:03.394 --> 31:04.813
Why were you calling?

31:07.797 --> 31:09.800
I wanted to tell you I'm...

31:11.793 --> 31:14.240
- I love you.
- Your bother's pissing in the garden.

31:15.330 --> 31:18.270
- Why?
- I... because it's there.

31:23.440 --> 31:25.106
What happened to you two?

32:13.116 --> 32:16.335
I get the drugs out of this
dead girl, you leave immediately.

32:18.633 --> 32:19.763
OK.

32:21.888 --> 32:24.120
And we split the money, 50/50.

32:25.895 --> 32:27.143
No.

32:30.044 --> 32:31.160
60/40.

32:31.280 --> 32:33.346
This isn't a negotiation.

32:33.355 --> 32:35.236
Split even or nothing.

32:39.050 --> 32:42.551
I may need one more day to set up the deal.

32:42.671 --> 32:44.206
You know someone?

32:44.531 --> 32:45.635
Yeah.

32:47.290 --> 32:48.619
I found a place.

32:48.828 --> 32:50.528
A job we did in West Ham.

32:50.835 --> 32:53.040
The house is due to be
demolished. We can do it there.

32:53.042 --> 32:54.560
Why can't we do it at your place?

32:55.067 --> 32:57.002
I'm not gonna do this
at my place, you idiot!

32:57.011 --> 32:58.730
Hey, don't call me an idiot.

33:02.898 --> 33:04.680
Get the check, please.

33:10.088 --> 33:12.394
- Under no circumstances.
- What?

33:12.394 --> 33:14.120
- Mom!
- Mom, just please!

33:14.148 --> 33:15.280
Yeah, come on.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.458
Maddy knows her way around, and

33:17.494 --> 33:21.080
me and Oliver, we can take any
bad guys who gives us trouble.

33:21.591 --> 33:24.132
- You know your dad would kill me.
- Mom, you're just so paranoid.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.400
Let us go!

33:25.520 --> 33:27.152
Kids. kids, kids, kids...

33:27.523 --> 33:29.600
Listen to her. She's right.

33:29.650 --> 33:31.846
Your mother is not comfortable letting go.

33:32.162 --> 33:33.709
We have to respect that.

33:45.850 --> 33:49.838
We thought these dragons were real, so...

33:49.850 --> 33:52.190
We... we found these igloos, and we

33:52.207 --> 33:54.459
- we thought this was his house...
- Hey hey hey hey.

33:54.579 --> 33:56.412
I think this is my meeting.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.131
So why don't you go out

33:58.493 --> 34:01.079
- and do kid stuff, uh?
- Like what?

34:01.098 --> 34:02.761
I don't know. You're 13, do you smoke?

34:02.762 --> 34:04.462
- No.
- What do you do for kicks?

34:04.498 --> 34:07.350
- Hmm, burn stuff.
- All right. Don't burn stuff here. Look,

34:07.356 --> 34:10.087
that woman over there, is
doing tattoos of henna. Get one.

34:10.120 --> 34:11.400
She's not clean.

34:11.520 --> 34:12.830
Build your immune system.

34:13.137 --> 34:14.918
You're with your uncle. Have fun!

34:15.520 --> 34:17.347
Come on, come on. Go go go go go go!

35:49.937 --> 35:52.813
- So where did you say it comes from?
- I didn't.

35:54.829 --> 35:56.873
Our friend in Oslo does vouch for you.

35:56.993 --> 35:59.875
I worked with Stefan a
long time on the Ritz.

36:00.640 --> 36:01.928
You can trust me.

36:06.597 --> 36:08.216
This address.

36:08.858 --> 36:09.960
2AM?

36:10.739 --> 36:14.654
- You know London pretty well.
- I know people who know London.

36:15.513 --> 36:17.339
It's a condemned house.

36:17.993 --> 36:18.960
It's safe.

36:22.189 --> 36:23.554
You mind if we talk?

36:24.658 --> 36:26.576
Gotta check on the kids.

36:30.799 --> 36:32.996
Hey, guys. Hey.

36:34.127 --> 36:36.713
- What did you get?
- She did a snake on my neck. Look.

36:37.997 --> 36:41.352
Your father will be so
pleased. What about you, buddy?

36:41.669 --> 36:44.300
Well, maybe not the one that says "Fuck".

36:44.562 --> 36:47.755
Hey, how much for the skull and the tattoo?

36:47.954 --> 36:50.006
Both of them, ah, 10 pounds.

36:50.040 --> 36:52.936
10 pounds? Perfect. Uh, can
you watch them for a second?

36:52.963 --> 36:54.360
- Sure.
- Thank you, thank you.

36:54.364 --> 36:56.480
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, guys, guys!

36:56.490 --> 36:58.040
Where are you going?

36:59.031 --> 37:00.686
I think we're gonna pass.

37:00.884 --> 37:04.185
- What do you mean?
- Yeah, thanks for making contact, but, uh...

37:05.650 --> 37:07.667
We got processes to follow.

37:07.676 --> 37:09.702
- Yeah.
- Checks and balances.

37:09.822 --> 37:11.628
Better luck next time.

37:12.333 --> 37:15.444
Come on, guys! It's a great deal! I mean...

37:16.800 --> 37:18.720
It's half-price!

37:35.764 --> 37:37.280
Excuse me?

37:37.682 --> 37:40.756
Sorry. Could I please have one of those?

37:41.073 --> 37:42.926
- Certainly.
- Thank you.

37:47.114 --> 37:48.470
Thank you.

37:55.768 --> 37:58.074
Thank you. Thank you.

38:12.752 --> 38:15.139
- Hey.
- Hey.

38:16.297 --> 38:17.920
How was your day?

38:22.356 --> 38:23.800
Good.

38:28.730 --> 38:30.340
Where are the kids?

38:30.973 --> 38:32.560
What, they're not here?

38:32.680 --> 38:34.788
- Uh?
- Well, they're with Martin.

38:34.908 --> 38:37.872
- What?
- I didn't... they said they wanted to spend time with their uncle.

39:08.825 --> 39:10.616
Cover your ears.

39:11.131 --> 39:12.400
Do it.

39:13.609 --> 39:16.262
Hello, English cocksuckers.

39:16.870 --> 39:19.800
How do I find the toughest
motherfucker in this shithole?

39:21.728 --> 39:23.356
Maddy, it's Mom.

39:23.476 --> 39:25.217
Again, uh, listen...

39:25.227 --> 39:27.225
Dad and I are waiting to
hear from you, all right?

39:27.240 --> 39:30.179
So please, please, call us the minute
you get this. We won't be angry.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.539
All right? The second you get
this, please, give us a call.

39:32.770 --> 39:33.965
All right.

39:36.132 --> 39:38.029
You know I think we
need to call the police.

39:40.088 --> 39:41.360
W... wait, wait.

39:42.570 --> 39:44.359
There's something I need to tell you.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.193
Oh my god!

39:55.208 --> 39:57.128
Well, I tired them up for you.

39:57.460 --> 39:59.627
- Where have you been?
- All over London.

39:59.643 --> 40:01.571
- Exploring.
- Until 11 o'clock!

40:01.586 --> 40:03.920
It was a lovely day, Mom, don't spoil it.

40:04.578 --> 40:07.400
You get upstairs. And you, now.

40:08.302 --> 40:09.589
Hey.

40:10.280 --> 40:11.520
Move.

40:16.891 --> 40:19.019
- Do you need all that stuff?
- Uh-huh.

40:19.405 --> 40:20.507
Put it on.

40:21.494 --> 40:22.840
What is it?

40:24.764 --> 40:26.314
Are you shitting me?

40:26.892 --> 40:30.000
If we get stopped, you'll look
like a professional, not a gorilla.

40:31.918 --> 40:34.201
Don't smoke here. They're chemicals.

40:47.833 --> 40:49.252
Fuck!

41:16.362 --> 41:18.868
- She's still frozen.
- No, just cold.

41:18.920 --> 41:20.533
She's stiff with rigor mortis.

41:20.549 --> 41:22.330
Can you just help me with the legs?

41:23.278 --> 41:24.273
Just like that.

41:25.144 --> 41:26.463
There you go.

41:30.156 --> 41:31.845
She was beautiful.

41:32.960 --> 41:34.065
You fucked her.

41:35.160 --> 41:36.556
Of course I fucked her.

41:37.327 --> 41:38.661
Wait, when she was alive.

41:40.781 --> 41:43.788
In fact, I think I might
have burst a balloon inside.

41:44.799 --> 41:46.217
You know, I'm pretty big.

41:48.040 --> 41:49.818
- She swallowed the balloons?
- Right.

41:49.826 --> 41:52.841
So the drugs are... still in her stomach.

41:52.872 --> 41:54.777
Yes, but I fucked her up the ass.

41:56.865 --> 41:58.647
Trust me big guy,

41:58.870 --> 42:02.720
your penis won't have traveled up her
colon, through her small intestine,

42:02.960 --> 42:05.560
into her stomach to pop a little balloon.

42:07.267 --> 42:10.120
We were doing it. She screamed.

42:10.159 --> 42:13.280
I felt like she came
inside. I thought it was me.

42:13.400 --> 42:15.880
But no, turns out she was dead.

42:17.769 --> 42:19.473
You put her jeans back on.

42:19.931 --> 42:22.042
Yeah. To give her some dignity.

42:37.926 --> 42:40.413
- Anything?
- Almost.

42:41.531 --> 42:43.208
Be gentle.

42:43.584 --> 42:45.425
I will, thank you.

42:58.399 --> 43:00.066
How many are there?

43:00.336 --> 43:02.380
I don't know, maybe fifty.

43:09.475 --> 43:10.750
Do you love your wife?

43:12.087 --> 43:15.490
Of course I love my wife.
What kind of question is that?

43:15.610 --> 43:18.449
I don't know. I was just
wondering, you know, the same woman

43:18.449 --> 43:21.320
for 15 years. You must be tired?

43:25.559 --> 43:27.191
Julie and I are great.

43:27.451 --> 43:29.755
- Better than great.
- Yeah.

43:29.875 --> 43:31.981
She's got fantastic tits.

43:32.858 --> 43:34.844
- Excuse me?
- Julie,

43:34.964 --> 43:36.713
fantastic tits.

43:36.833 --> 43:39.280
I didn't know that English
women had tits like that.

43:39.520 --> 43:42.268
- Stop talking about my wife.
- What? It's a compliment.

43:42.388 --> 43:43.720
You should be flattered.

43:44.929 --> 43:48.953
Tell me, were your kids
vaginal or caesarian delivered?

43:49.606 --> 43:51.647
Hey, come on! That's 2 grand, man!

43:51.680 --> 43:53.680
Stop talking about my wife!

44:03.282 --> 44:04.480
Thanks.

44:04.946 --> 44:06.200
Hello?

44:06.320 --> 44:07.885
- It's my buyers.
- What?

44:07.920 --> 44:09.182
My buyers for the gear.

44:09.200 --> 44:11.597
- What? What?
- Hey, guys!

44:13.182 --> 44:15.480
If he doesn't stand up, shoot him.

44:15.600 --> 44:17.690
I'm up. I'm up! Hey, guys.

44:17.810 --> 44:20.875
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Who're you? Hannibal Lecter?

44:20.912 --> 44:22.600
I'm his brother.

44:23.103 --> 44:24.559
His brother.

44:24.929 --> 44:26.640
Guys, I thought you were not interested.

44:26.654 --> 44:29.177
Yeah, we, uh, changed our minds.

44:29.600 --> 44:30.447
That's great.

44:30.476 --> 44:32.167
I apologize.

44:32.654 --> 44:35.050
Sometimes you have to tell
a little white lie, you know,

44:35.249 --> 44:37.483
you know, to stay ahead of the competition.

44:39.166 --> 44:40.884
It is an ugly game.

44:42.148 --> 44:43.540
I feel for you.

44:44.409 --> 44:46.036
My name's Joey Samson.

44:46.073 --> 44:48.920
I work for a gentleman by
the name of Nelson Clay.

44:49.160 --> 44:50.756
- This the product?
- Yeah.

44:51.932 --> 44:55.739
50 heroin balloons fresh from Tunisia.

44:55.760 --> 44:58.239
- Thank you. I won't be a moment.
- Okay.

45:03.977 --> 45:07.350
Your, uh... your accent is
different from your brother's.

45:07.470 --> 45:09.647
Yeah, I've been here for 17 years.

45:09.692 --> 45:14.390
- It's his first time in the UK.
- Bullshit! No, no. I've been here.

45:14.422 --> 45:16.240
- I spent two years in...
- Scotland.

45:16.266 --> 45:17.495
Ah, I like the jocks.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.600
I can't understand a fucking word though.

45:19.606 --> 45:22.602
Yeah, so "r" and "ach". "Ach, no, please!"

45:23.730 --> 45:25.110
Yeah!

45:26.480 --> 45:27.836
It looks good.

45:28.120 --> 45:30.718
- We have ourselves a deal.
- Don't fucking move!

45:30.734 --> 45:32.099
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

45:33.259 --> 45:34.887
Stop shout, everybody.

45:39.363 --> 45:42.230
Now, these are the guys I was expecting.

45:44.925 --> 45:46.120
Put your guns down.

45:50.440 --> 45:51.414
Lower them.

45:54.987 --> 45:56.814
Th... there's no good end to this.

45:57.364 --> 45:59.163
Joey, put it down.

45:59.283 --> 46:01.677
- No way.
- They're not gonna shoot.

46:01.982 --> 46:03.285
Aren't you lads?

46:05.467 --> 46:07.375
You don't want to kill anybody tonight.

46:18.491 --> 46:20.679
- What do you wanna do?
- I'm thinking.

46:20.697 --> 46:24.269
- Well, I trusted him and I put my gun down.
- Talk.

46:26.808 --> 46:28.830
- Care to explain?
- Yeah.

46:30.073 --> 46:31.547
It's very simple.

46:31.556 --> 46:34.052
Uh, I came to these guys first,

46:34.088 --> 46:37.320
- and they said no.
- Uh uh uh, we said "maybe not".

46:38.069 --> 46:40.310
Maybe not. And then, I came to you guys...

46:40.339 --> 46:41.840
And you gave them the location?

46:42.090 --> 46:44.915
Well, it was a great deal.
You should have accepted it.

46:45.305 --> 46:48.470
Yeah, you don't give us the
location. Or if you do, you change it.

46:48.487 --> 46:51.272
Well, I don't know London.
It's my first time here.

46:52.010 --> 46:53.560
So what now?

46:55.668 --> 46:58.381
- We can divide by two...
- What the fuck?!

47:09.430 --> 47:10.396
Well,

47:10.731 --> 47:12.680
we came out to do some business.

47:12.693 --> 47:15.740
Show initiative, score some brown,
get on our employer's good side.

47:15.760 --> 47:18.065
Instead of which we got
a huge fucking problem:

47:18.080 --> 47:21.456
two dead bodies, and two witnesses.

47:21.929 --> 47:23.200
Come on.

47:27.490 --> 47:30.779
- Fuck you!
- What if we find a solution that benefits everyone?

47:32.279 --> 47:33.771
Shoot us now,

47:34.593 --> 47:36.718
you're guilty of four murders,

47:37.485 --> 47:39.430
and implicated in hers.

47:39.903 --> 47:41.811
No matter how much you try,

47:42.199 --> 47:44.496
cut us to pieces, burn
this place to the ground,

47:44.520 --> 47:46.840
you will leave trace evidence.

47:48.457 --> 47:51.151
- You will get caught.
- Yes you will.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.555
I can make it go away.

47:58.331 --> 47:59.561
I'm the best.

47:59.850 --> 48:01.200
Yes, he is.

48:02.695 --> 48:04.802
You only killed two people, not four.

48:05.121 --> 48:06.920
I clean the whole scene.

48:06.961 --> 48:08.760
Every spot of blood,

48:08.880 --> 48:10.656
every latent print.

48:11.123 --> 48:12.606
The bodies disappear.

48:13.312 --> 48:15.129
Like they've never been here.

48:15.500 --> 48:18.231
You get to take the
heroin back to your boss.

48:19.160 --> 48:20.908
Everybody wins.

48:29.970 --> 48:31.000
No.

48:31.589 --> 48:34.817
- Well, what if he can?
- It's been a long night.

48:35.920 --> 48:38.985
- I would like it to be over.
- Yeah, but what if he can do it?

48:39.861 --> 48:41.625
Well, I'm not gay or nothing,

48:42.056 --> 48:45.800
but I don't feel right killing
people unless I absolutely have to.

48:46.654 --> 48:48.715
Well, I saw a thing on National Geographic,

48:49.692 --> 48:52.640
bad karma, yin and yang, uh,

48:52.893 --> 48:55.440
the Hindus are really big
in it, maybe Buddhists.

48:55.904 --> 48:58.640
If you chose to do something
bad, instead of having to,

48:58.760 --> 49:01.610
it increases the universal
sum of negative energy.

49:01.916 --> 49:04.140
Shut the fuck

49:04.482 --> 49:05.558
up!

49:16.472 --> 49:17.973
No promises.

52:23.843 --> 52:25.208
You do good work.

52:26.836 --> 52:29.296
I really don't think
the killing is justified.

52:33.440 --> 52:34.790
It's been educational.

52:36.560 --> 52:37.560
What about my money?

52:38.403 --> 52:40.040
I brought you a lot of product.

52:40.160 --> 52:42.523
Yeah, you made it harder than
it should have been as well.

52:42.530 --> 52:44.941
- You didn't even sweat you son of...
- Hey, hey, hey!

52:44.969 --> 52:46.388
- Calm down!
- Listen.

52:47.003 --> 52:49.572
You have a bad temper, OK?

52:50.749 --> 52:53.680
- That's never a good thing.
- It's... it's gonna be all right.

53:30.523 --> 53:32.539
We don't tell anyone about this.

53:51.901 --> 53:53.990
Promise you'll never say anything, OK?

54:12.000 --> 54:13.560
You Jean BastiÃ¨re?

54:17.280 --> 54:20.317
For a job well done. Mr. Clay
may call upon you in the future.
