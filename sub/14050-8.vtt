WEBVTT

00:11.800 --> 00:13.960
I really should be going soon, you know.

00:11.800 --> 00:13.960
Juliet will start to worry.

00:14.000 --> 00:15.120
And how long has she got to go?

00:15.160 --> 00:16.280
Two weeks.

00:16.320 --> 00:17.840
Oh!

00:17.880 --> 00:20.000
You know, my mother said that first babies are always late.

00:20.040 --> 00:22.920
Oh, we'll see, mmm.

00:22.960 --> 00:25.040
How's things going with the new stepdaddy?

00:25.080 --> 00:26.920
Not funny, Dwayne. They're just friends.

00:26.960 --> 00:29.280
Yeah, right.

00:30.640 --> 00:32.680
-Dwayne, no. -One more!

00:33.600 --> 00:35.080
Uh-oh. I'm in trouble.

00:52.440 --> 00:54.200
You're late.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.480
And good morning to you, too.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.320
I know I agreed to do more small talk,

00:58.440 --> 01:01.320
particularly in the mornings,

01:01.360 --> 01:04.440
but that doesn't mean I can't point out when you're late.

01:04.480 --> 01:09.120
I'm late because there's been a murder.

01:04.480 --> 01:09.120
Up in the hills.

01:09.160 --> 01:10.520
RICHARD: So what do we know?

01:10.560 --> 01:12.440
CAMILLE: Not much. Nadia Selim, 30 years old.

01:12.480 --> 01:14.880
Lived at this address for a little under two years.

01:17.240 --> 01:19.520
Quiet, Harry, quiet! These are friends.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.920
Sorry. He's Nadia's dog and he's very distressed.

01:19.560 --> 01:22.920
Come here.

01:22.960 --> 01:26.360
-Georgie Westcott.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.720
I live across there.

01:27.760 --> 01:29.440
And you're the lady who made the call?

01:29.480 --> 01:31.760
Yes, well, um...

01:31.800 --> 01:34.840
Nadia and I travel into work together every morning.

01:34.880 --> 01:37.640
But this morning, she was late,

01:34.880 --> 01:37.640
which isn't like her.

01:37.680 --> 01:40.520
And I rang, and...

01:40.560 --> 01:42.520
When there was no answer,

01:42.560 --> 01:45.360
I used my spare key and went in and...

01:45.400 --> 01:47.040
and that's when I found her.

02:01.720 --> 02:03.240
CAMILLE: Hey, I found the bedroom.

02:04.080 --> 02:06.360
You know, where the body is? You're worried

02:08.160 --> 02:10.440
the furniture's not straight?

02:12.440 --> 02:13.440
Yeah.

02:16.360 --> 02:19.200
Your neighbour's late for picking you up.

02:19.240 --> 02:22.600
Do you really use your spare key to enter her house?

02:22.640 --> 02:25.160
Why would she have coins stuffed in her mouth?

02:27.240 --> 02:29.720
-That's interesting...

02:29.760 --> 02:34.160
I've got a body up here and somebody has stuffed coins

02:29.760 --> 02:34.160
in her mouth.

02:35.440 --> 02:37.840
What have you got that's so interesting?

02:39.840 --> 02:42.280
Dwayne's police shield.

03:19.680 --> 03:20.800
Dwayne's outside.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.480
Sir, the medics want to know about moving the body.

03:31.520 --> 03:33.280
I'll go and talk to them, Fidel.

03:33.320 --> 03:34.760
Photograph the scene for me, if you would.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.200
Yes, sir.

03:37.240 --> 03:40.800
Can you tell us how your shield ended up

03:37.240 --> 03:40.800
at a murder scene?

03:44.000 --> 03:46.800
When we finished last night, we all went for a drink.

03:46.840 --> 03:49.960
-Me, Fidel and Camille.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.560
I see. You didn't invite anyone else?

03:52.600 --> 03:54.240
No.

03:54.280 --> 03:57.040
Or think to invite anyone else?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.560
Never mind. Carry on.

04:00.600 --> 04:04.040
We had something to eat, a few beers, some rum.

04:04.080 --> 04:07.120
Then I met her. Nadia. Outside the bar.

04:10.200 --> 04:11.200
<i>Bonsoir.</i>

04:13.240 --> 04:15.520
We talked. Sort of hit it off, you know?

04:15.560 --> 04:18.520
She said she wanted to go for a walk and

04:15.560 --> 04:18.520
she was very pretty.

04:19.640 --> 04:21.800
In the end, I walked her all the way home.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.560
CAMILLE:<i> What time was this?</i> DWAYNE:<i> About 10:00.</i>

04:23.600 --> 04:26.280
<i>You want to come in</i> <i>for coffee?</i>

04:26.320 --> 04:30.320
That, um, mark on your neck. How'd you get it?

04:30.360 --> 04:34.760
We were messing around. She asked me to teach her

04:30.360 --> 04:34.760
some self-defence moves.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.640
-No.

04:36.680 --> 04:39.480
Like I said, I was showing her some moves,

04:39.520 --> 04:41.920
she said she was nervous about walking home alone.

04:44.320 --> 04:45.320
Okay.

04:47.160 --> 04:48.360
We had a bit of a cuddle.

04:48.400 --> 04:49.960
-Yes.

04:51.600 --> 04:55.200
-I left just after midnight.

04:55.240 --> 04:57.240
You didn't see anyone on the way home?

04:57.800 --> 04:59.800
No.

04:59.840 --> 05:01.560
And when you left her, the victim was alive and well?

05:01.600 --> 05:03.760
-Yes. -What kind of question

05:01.600 --> 05:03.760
is that?

05:03.800 --> 05:06.120
The kind of question you ask a witness in a murder inquiry.

05:06.160 --> 05:08.240
-No, this is Dwayne. -He's still a witness.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.200
You just asked him if he killed her.

05:10.240 --> 05:11.640
No, I didn't.

05:11.680 --> 05:13.960
You asked if she was still alive when he left.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.280
Look, it's okay. I know you have to ask me

05:16.320 --> 05:18.600
this stuff.

05:18.640 --> 05:21.400
It's procedure. Right?

05:21.440 --> 05:24.520
-I've got photos, sir. -Thank you, Fidel.

05:24.560 --> 05:26.520
Right, I want door-to-door inquiries.

05:26.560 --> 05:28.520
Start taking statements from all the neighbours,

05:28.560 --> 05:30.200
anyone who knew her.

05:30.240 --> 05:33.080
Particularly if anyone saw her or anyone else last night.

05:33.120 --> 05:35.280
-Yes, sir. -Not you, Dwayne.

05:35.320 --> 05:36.760
-Chief... -You're a witness,

05:36.800 --> 05:38.840
quite possibly the last person to see the victim alive.

05:38.880 --> 05:41.400
I can't have you knocking on people's doors

05:38.880 --> 05:41.400
asking them questions.

05:41.440 --> 05:43.320
Why not?

05:43.360 --> 05:45.680
Because if he asks them whether they saw the victim

05:43.360 --> 05:45.680
with anyone last night,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.480
and they say, "Yes, Officer, I saw her with you,"

05:47.520 --> 05:51.320
then it muddies the water just a little,

05:47.520 --> 05:51.320
don't you think?

05:51.360 --> 05:53.760
Go back to the station and write up your statement.

05:53.800 --> 05:55.080
Yes, Chief.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.680
What?

05:59.720 --> 06:02.000
Fidel, go and start talking to the neighbours.

06:07.080 --> 06:09.600
Please tell me you don't believe

06:07.080 --> 06:09.600
Dwayne is involved in this.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.440
He was the last person to see her alive.

06:11.480 --> 06:13.040
Apart from the killer.

06:13.080 --> 06:15.240
He has a scratch mark on his neck he admits

06:13.080 --> 06:15.240
came from the victim.

06:15.280 --> 06:18.040
-He explained that. -I'm simply doing things

06:15.280 --> 06:18.040
by the book.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.840
I don't care about your stupid book.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.600
I want to know if you think Dwayne killed this girl,

06:19.880 --> 06:23.600
yes or no.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.320
Based purely on my knowledge of Dwayne

06:25.360 --> 06:26.760
and the fact that everything points towards

06:26.800 --> 06:28.440
this being a premeditated murder,

06:28.480 --> 06:30.640
while Dwayne clearly only met the victim

06:28.480 --> 06:30.640
hours before she was killed,

06:30.680 --> 06:32.720
therefore making it difficult to corroborate

06:30.680 --> 06:32.720
such a premeditation,

06:32.760 --> 06:34.960
I'd say that, on balance, it's unlikely.

06:36.080 --> 06:37.160
Was that yes or no?

06:37.200 --> 06:38.960
-No! -Good!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.480
Although strictly speaking, that doesn't mean

06:39.000 --> 06:41.480
he didn't do it.

06:41.520 --> 06:45.320
Look, we owe it to the victim to conduct

06:41.520 --> 06:45.320
a thorough investigation.

06:45.360 --> 06:46.560
Why are you being so grumpy? -I'm not being grumpy.

06:46.600 --> 06:47.800
-Yes, you are.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.400
I'm simply doing my job.

06:49.440 --> 06:51.520
Then let's stop talking about Dwayne and

06:49.440 --> 06:51.520
find the real killer.

06:51.560 --> 06:53.600
There has to be a connection.

06:53.640 --> 06:56.280
Dwayne left his badge behind, so he must have been

06:53.640 --> 06:56.280
in uniform, right?

06:56.320 --> 06:57.400
Yes.

06:57.440 --> 06:58.880
Okay, so you're a girl in a bar, fine.

06:58.920 --> 07:01.600
So you invite a policeman back to your house, fine.

07:01.640 --> 07:04.120
Then you're killed the moment he leaves?

07:01.640 --> 07:04.120
It's connected. It has to be.

07:05.080 --> 07:07.600
Okay. But why?

07:07.640 --> 07:11.440
Well, at the risk of being called grumpy again, that's

07:07.640 --> 07:11.440
what I intend to find out!

07:14.320 --> 07:16.120
-Morning, sir.

07:16.160 --> 07:19.040
Is that right

07:19.080 --> 07:20.640
Yes. Do you live here?

07:20.680 --> 07:23.120
Me? Oh, no, no. I was just passing.

07:23.160 --> 07:25.120
I saw a commotion.

07:25.160 --> 07:27.320
-If you'll excuse me.

07:27.360 --> 07:28.520
Burglar, was it?

07:28.560 --> 07:31.680
I'm sorry. I can't discuss that with you.

07:40.840 --> 07:42.560
This is about last night, isn't it?

07:42.600 --> 07:44.080
What?

07:44.120 --> 07:45.680
Why you're being so grumpy.

07:45.720 --> 07:47.160
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:47.200 --> 07:49.160
Because we all went for a drink last night...

07:49.200 --> 07:51.120
No, no, no. Not "we all". Just you three.

07:51.160 --> 07:53.000
I knew that's what it was. Okay, look...

07:53.040 --> 07:57.280
No, just discovering the words "we all" doesn't seem

07:53.040 --> 07:57.280
to include me?

07:57.320 --> 07:58.920
A little bit chastening, that's all.

07:58.960 --> 08:02.280
How can it include you? You never come

07:58.960 --> 08:02.280
out for a drink.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.440
You never ask me.

08:03.480 --> 08:05.440
No, no, no. We stopped asking.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.440
There's a difference. And you tell me, who's more rude,

08:08.480 --> 08:12.080
the person who stops asking or the person who never

08:08.480 --> 08:12.080
once says yes?

08:34.600 --> 08:36.920
Okay, I'm sorry I snapped.

08:40.200 --> 08:41.720
-English. -And you're very French.

08:41.760 --> 08:44.080
Now, can we please get on with the task in hand?

08:46.960 --> 08:49.840
Why did the killer fill her mouth with money?

08:50.320 --> 08:51.320
Hmm.

08:52.240 --> 08:53.320
Repaying a debt?

08:55.000 --> 08:57.000
Looks like asphyxiation.

08:57.040 --> 08:59.240
No other sign of trauma, as far as I can see.

09:00.040 --> 09:01.920
Doesn't make sense.

09:04.760 --> 09:06.480
Why are these drawers sticking out?

09:23.080 --> 09:25.080
Okay, so she's murdered,

09:25.120 --> 09:27.320
coins symbolically placed into her mouth,

09:27.360 --> 09:29.680
but you're still on the furniture, aren't you?

09:31.160 --> 09:34.600
"Nadia Selim, Finance Director,

09:31.160 --> 09:34.600
JIT Shipping."

09:34.640 --> 09:36.280
You ever heard of JIT Shipping?

09:36.320 --> 09:40.520
No. So go on, then. What's so interesting about

09:36.320 --> 09:40.520
the furniture?

09:40.560 --> 09:44.880
I think that after Nadia was killed, the house was

09:40.560 --> 09:44.880
searched, thoroughly.

09:44.920 --> 09:46.560
This cushion was unzipped,

09:47.640 --> 09:49.080
this cover wasn't straight,

09:50.720 --> 09:53.760
the corner of this carpet's folded over,

09:53.800 --> 09:59.200
the books aren't quite flat against the shelves.

09:59.240 --> 10:03.000
Everything's been checked and put back, done so you almost

09:59.240 --> 10:03.000
wouldn't notice,

10:03.040 --> 10:05.160
unless you knew what you were looking for.

10:05.200 --> 10:08.400
Okay. So the killer was looking for something?

10:08.440 --> 10:11.240
-That's good. -No, it's not good.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.560
It's illogical.

10:13.600 --> 10:17.560
The smashed glass, the lamp knocked over like this

10:13.600 --> 10:17.560
suggests she was in her bed.

10:17.600 --> 10:20.720
She lashed out, but she was suffocated before she could

10:17.600 --> 10:20.720
do anything.

10:20.760 --> 10:22.560
What's illogical about that?

10:22.600 --> 10:25.480
Well, she was killed first, then the house was searched.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.040
Why not keep your victim alive so she can tell you

10:28.080 --> 10:29.880
where to find what you're looking for?

10:29.920 --> 10:32.560
As I said, it's illogical.

10:32.600 --> 10:36.080
So what did Nadia have in her house

10:32.600 --> 10:36.080
that was worth killing over?

10:36.120 --> 10:38.800
And did the killer find it?

10:38.840 --> 10:40.280
Were any of these windows open?

10:40.320 --> 10:41.640
No.

10:41.680 --> 10:43.440
Or have they been forced in any way?

10:43.480 --> 10:45.120
Not as far as we can see.

10:45.160 --> 10:48.760
No sign of a break

10:48.800 --> 10:50.560
Maybe the victim opened the door, but why would she?

10:50.600 --> 10:51.920
We know it was past midnight.

10:53.520 --> 10:55.080
The neighbour had a key.

11:23.200 --> 11:26.480
Shh. Good boy.

11:26.520 --> 11:28.760
Do we really believe the neighbour let herself in

11:28.800 --> 11:30.880
just because the victim was late for work?

11:30.920 --> 11:33.120
Agreed.

11:33.160 --> 11:36.840
How did the killer get inside without breaking any locks?

11:36.880 --> 11:40.080
Why did he fill the victim's mouth with coins?

11:40.120 --> 11:42.160
What was he looking for when he searched the house?

11:42.200 --> 11:44.320
Why did he kill her before he started looking,

11:44.360 --> 11:48.240
and having killed her, did he find what

11:44.360 --> 11:48.240
he was looking for?

11:48.280 --> 11:51.320
And is her death in any way linked to her taking

11:48.280 --> 11:51.320
home a policeman?

11:52.640 --> 11:55.520
Ah, Fidel. What do the neighbours say?

11:55.560 --> 11:56.920
Not very much.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.720
It seems like the victim kept herself

11:56.960 --> 11:58.720
to herself mostly,

12:01.040 --> 12:02.840
Two of them heard her dog barking around 10:00.

12:02.880 --> 12:05.440
That must have been her and Dwayne arriving at the house.

12:05.480 --> 12:07.960
But no one saw or heard anything suspicious.

12:08.000 --> 12:10.320
And those that knew her say that she was a very nice lady

12:10.360 --> 12:12.200
and they can't think of why anyone would want to harm her.

12:12.240 --> 12:14.760
Hmm. Yet someone did.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.880
Where next?

12:23.640 --> 12:26.920
I'm John Taylor. I own the company.

12:28.240 --> 12:29.560
Thank you for seeing us.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.120
Anything that can help catch Nadia's killer.

12:32.160 --> 12:36.080
I couldn't believe when I heard. It's hit everybody

12:32.160 --> 12:36.080
here very hard.

12:36.120 --> 12:37.640
Of course.

12:37.680 --> 12:39.800
What line of business are you in, Mr Taylor?

12:39.840 --> 12:41.760
Import-export.

12:41.800 --> 12:43.920
Throughout the Caribbean, USA and Europe.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.280
What sort of goods?

12:45.320 --> 12:48.120
Oh, whatever I can make a profit on.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.320
I understand Nadia was your finance director.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.280
That's right.

12:52.320 --> 12:54.520
Is that her desk? -Yes.

12:58.080 --> 12:59.800
Nadia dealt with our finances,

12:59.840 --> 13:03.720
but her real skill was finding loopholes in tax regimes.

13:03.760 --> 13:06.680
She could get a subsidy in one country by

13:03.760 --> 13:06.680
taking goods out of it

13:06.720 --> 13:10.160
and a rebate in another by bringing them in.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.800
RICHARD: How long had she worked for you?

13:11.840 --> 13:14.440
TAYLOR: A couple of years.

13:14.480 --> 13:16.560
I don't know how we're going to get on without her.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.760
Or have any debts elsewhere?

13:22.800 --> 13:25.480
No, I... I don't think she even had a credit card.

13:25.520 --> 13:26.800
She didn't approve of debt.

13:29.920 --> 13:32.640
What about her next

13:32.680 --> 13:34.440
She also works with you, doesn't she?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.480
That's right. Georgie's my PA.

13:36.520 --> 13:39.200
And how did Nadia and she get on?

13:43.520 --> 13:44.520
Yes?

13:46.320 --> 13:47.400
Georgie...

13:49.200 --> 13:52.000
I think she felt a little overshadowed

13:49.200 --> 13:52.000
when Nadia arrived.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.920
Jealous, even.

13:53.960 --> 13:57.040
Nadia really was a remarkable woman.

13:57.080 --> 13:58.920
So they didn't get on?

13:58.960 --> 14:01.040
They weren't natural friends.

14:01.080 --> 14:05.200
And Nadia could be withering if she thought you weren't

14:01.080 --> 14:05.200
pulling your weight.

14:09.080 --> 14:11.640
Can I ask where you were last night?

14:11.680 --> 14:13.400
I was at home.

14:13.440 --> 14:15.720
-Yes.

14:16.560 --> 14:17.760
Anyone with you?

14:19.200 --> 14:21.240
-No, I live alone. -Hmm.

14:22.520 --> 14:26.800
So you're not married or in a relationship?

14:27.640 --> 14:28.640
No.

14:31.360 --> 14:32.440
Anything?

14:36.000 --> 14:37.760
CAMILLE: Is this her personal laptop?

14:37.800 --> 14:39.280
Yes.

14:41.840 --> 14:43.720
I'm sorry. I can't allow that.

14:43.760 --> 14:45.080
Why is that?

14:45.120 --> 14:46.640
It's got a lot of sensitive information on it.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.600
We're used to handling sensitive information.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.360
That may well be, but the computer belongs to

14:48.640 --> 14:51.360
the company and I...

14:51.400 --> 14:54.680
Would you rather we got a warrant and took if from

14:51.400 --> 14:54.680
you by force?

15:05.240 --> 15:09.600
Whether or not he killed Nadia, John Taylor

15:05.240 --> 15:09.600
is hiding something.

15:09.640 --> 15:11.960
CAMILLE: I'll start with checking Nadia's laptop.

15:17.520 --> 15:20.200
-Here's my statement, Chief. -Thank you.

15:25.720 --> 15:27.360
Dwayne.

15:31.480 --> 15:34.000
Does it say anything other than you met

15:31.480 --> 15:34.000
the victim in a bar,

15:34.040 --> 15:36.840
walked her home, taught her a few self-defence moves,

15:36.880 --> 15:38.960
during which you sustained a small injury

15:39.000 --> 15:42.280
and gave her a little bit of a "cuddle" before leaving

15:39.000 --> 15:42.280
around midnight?

15:42.320 --> 15:44.360
No, Chief.

15:44.400 --> 15:48.560
You didn't argue or asphyxiate her or fill her

15:44.400 --> 15:48.560
mouth with loose change?

15:48.600 --> 15:49.800
Of course I didn't.

15:49.840 --> 15:52.480
Then I'm eliminating you from our inquiries.

15:52.520 --> 15:54.280
DWAYNE: What about procedure?

15:54.320 --> 15:56.560
We work better as a team, so you can start by

15:54.320 --> 15:56.560
looking through the files

15:56.600 --> 15:59.360
and seeing if we've got anything previous

15:56.600 --> 15:59.360
on Nadia Selim

15:59.400 --> 16:00.960
or JIT Shipping.

16:01.840 --> 16:03.000
Thanks, Chief. I'm on it.

16:11.560 --> 16:14.080
So what kind of name is Selim?

16:14.120 --> 16:17.400
Sounds Turkish or Middle Eastern.

16:32.960 --> 16:34.840
FIDEL: According to this, you were right.

16:34.880 --> 16:37.880
Selim is Arabic. It means "safe".

16:37.920 --> 16:40.200
CAMILLE: There were 26 coins in all.

16:40.240 --> 16:42.560
-Not even $3. -Hmm.

16:43.240 --> 16:45.160
Hardly a debt repaid.

16:46.800 --> 16:51.040
Which leaves us with it being symbolic,

16:46.800 --> 16:51.040
a message to someone.

16:51.600 --> 16:53.000
But who?

16:53.040 --> 16:55.160
Only one thing on file, Chief.

16:55.200 --> 16:57.240
About five weeks ago, one of the victim's neighbours

16:57.280 --> 17:00.080
made an official complaint about her dog barking.

17:00.120 --> 17:01.720
Thought it looked vicious.

17:01.760 --> 17:04.880
-It's a beautiful dog. -Till it takes your arm off.

17:04.920 --> 17:06.720
Who made the complaint?

17:06.760 --> 17:09.680
Uh, a Jacko Gardiner.

17:09.720 --> 17:10.880
I interviewed him this morning.

17:10.920 --> 17:12.800
And?

17:12.840 --> 17:16.600
Well, he complained about the dog again, but other than

17:12.840 --> 17:16.600
that he said that

17:16.640 --> 17:18.480
he didn't see or hear anything

17:18.520 --> 17:21.240
and that he didn't know the victim

17:18.520 --> 17:21.240
particularly well.

17:21.280 --> 17:23.480
He knew her well enough to make a complaint about her.

17:23.520 --> 17:27.320
You're not going to kill someone because their dog

17:23.520 --> 17:27.320
barks too much.

17:27.360 --> 17:29.840
I once investigated a murder where a husband killed a wife

17:29.880 --> 17:32.400
because she refused to pass him

17:29.880 --> 17:32.400
the TV remote control.

17:32.440 --> 17:34.400
Yeah, that is annoying.

17:34.440 --> 17:36.960
At the moment, if we're ruling you out,

17:38.080 --> 17:39.600
it's all we've got.

17:48.880 --> 17:50.240
RICHARD: That's interesting.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.200
Hmm.

17:54.680 --> 17:55.800
Hmm. Hmm.

18:18.400 --> 18:22.160
Barking dogs, neighbours snitching

18:18.400 --> 18:22.160
on one another, vendettas...

18:23.640 --> 18:25.840
I may have been transplanted a few thousand miles,

18:25.880 --> 18:28.160
surrounded by jungle and, um,

18:28.200 --> 18:30.800
that is quite clearly a goat crossing

18:28.200 --> 18:30.800
the road, even as I speak,

18:30.840 --> 18:32.360
but I recognise this place.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.440
This

18:35.960 --> 18:37.520
is suburbia.

18:37.560 --> 18:41.760
Your version of it, perhaps, but suburbia.

18:41.800 --> 18:44.360
These are my people.

18:48.400 --> 18:49.560
What do you want?

18:51.800 --> 18:54.680
Mr Gardiner, could we have a quick word?

18:54.720 --> 18:58.400
I understand you made a formal complaint against

18:54.720 --> 18:58.400
your neighbour, Nadia Selim.

18:58.440 --> 19:00.360
That dog of hers should be shot.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.440
It's vicious. She didn't control it.

19:02.880 --> 19:06.440
She let it run wild.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.880
It's a danger to others and it barked day and night.

19:09.920 --> 19:13.800
The postman turn up, it bark. Somebody walk past, it bark.

19:13.840 --> 19:15.680
-Yes, I did.

19:15.720 --> 19:17.680
Just as I was getting into my bath.

19:19.200 --> 19:20.400
And what time was that?

19:20.440 --> 19:23.400
Like I told the boy you sent earlier, 10:00.

19:23.440 --> 19:26.560
I always take my bath at 10:00.

19:26.600 --> 19:30.240
Did you ever argue with Miss Selim about her dog

19:26.600 --> 19:30.240
at her house?

19:30.280 --> 19:32.240
-No. -You never went to her house

19:30.280 --> 19:32.240
last night?

19:33.440 --> 19:34.800
I said no, didn't I?

19:36.320 --> 19:38.400
Have you seen anyone in the area

19:36.320 --> 19:38.400
recently you don't know?

19:39.160 --> 19:40.320
Yeah.

19:40.360 --> 19:42.440
-You two.

19:42.480 --> 19:44.120
Is that it?

19:44.160 --> 19:46.240
RICHARD: Yeah, well, um...

19:48.200 --> 19:49.720
We may be back.

19:50.920 --> 19:52.320
"My people."

20:00.480 --> 20:02.480
The statements taken by Fidel, did you read them?

20:02.520 --> 20:03.680
Yes.

20:03.720 --> 20:06.320
Well, some of them, including Mr Gardiner,

20:06.360 --> 20:09.280
reported a dog barking at or around 10:00 pm.

20:09.320 --> 20:11.680
When we think she and Dwayne arrived back at the house.

20:11.720 --> 20:13.720
Exactly.

20:13.760 --> 20:15.920
But none of them mentioned anything about it

20:13.760 --> 20:15.920
barking later. Why not?

20:15.960 --> 20:19.080
I mean, the killer must have arrived after Dwayne left.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.040
It's past midnight, someone arrives at the house,

20:21.080 --> 20:23.240
possibly breaking in, somehow.

20:23.280 --> 20:27.200
Why didn't the dog, that seemingly

20:23.280 --> 20:27.200
barks at everything, bark?

20:28.440 --> 20:30.400
You're right. It doesn't make any sense.

20:30.440 --> 20:31.920
Mmm.

20:31.960 --> 20:35.560
The curious incident of the dog who didn't

20:31.960 --> 20:35.560
bark in the night.

20:35.600 --> 20:37.360
Sorry?

20:40.160 --> 20:42.280
When Fidel went to interview Georgie Westcott,

20:42.320 --> 20:43.840
there was no answer.

20:43.880 --> 20:47.080
So why is she now watching us from behind her net curtains?

20:56.440 --> 20:57.440
Hello?

21:02.120 --> 21:03.200
Hello?

21:10.680 --> 21:12.520
-I wasn't.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.240
Not really.

21:16.280 --> 21:19.120
An officer came to your door this morning,

21:16.280 --> 21:19.120
but you didn't answer.

21:19.160 --> 21:21.880
-I must have been out.

21:22.360 --> 21:23.480
Walking Harry.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.040
Sorry.

21:27.080 --> 21:28.600
Do you mind if we, um...

21:31.080 --> 21:32.080
Yep.

22:02.360 --> 22:04.760
It's good of you to look after Miss Selim's dog.

22:04.800 --> 22:06.400
He's not a nuisance for you at all?

22:06.440 --> 22:09.320
Of course not. We had a pact.

22:09.360 --> 22:11.760
If anything happened to me, Nadia would look after my cat

22:11.800 --> 22:13.480
and if anything happened to her...

22:13.520 --> 22:16.040
You have a cat?

22:16.080 --> 22:18.880
She's in hiding. She doesn't much like Harry.

22:18.920 --> 22:21.240
Well, dogs in general.

22:21.280 --> 22:24.120
We went to see your employer, Mr Taylor.

22:24.160 --> 22:26.680
You're his personal assistant, is that right?

22:26.720 --> 22:27.720
Yes.

22:29.120 --> 22:31.280
And you don't seem very happy about it.

22:31.720 --> 22:32.720
He's...

22:35.640 --> 22:37.440
What?

22:40.640 --> 22:43.400
First it was me. That was bad enough.

22:43.440 --> 22:46.240
But all that changed when Nadia came along.

22:48.000 --> 22:51.200
He fell for her hook, line and sinker.

22:51.240 --> 22:53.280
He'd send inappropriate emails the whole time

22:53.320 --> 22:55.480
and when he talked to her, you could tell he was...

23:00.400 --> 23:02.120
Undressing her with his eyes.

23:03.360 --> 23:05.400
Why did Nadia put up with it?

23:05.440 --> 23:07.640
She said it was nothing compared to what she'd put up

23:05.440 --> 23:07.640
with in the past.

23:07.680 --> 23:10.840
-I assumed she had

23:07.680 --> 23:10.840
boyfriend trouble.

23:10.880 --> 23:12.880
But she never really talked about it.

23:14.440 --> 23:16.560
Whenever I tried to talk to her about her past,

23:16.600 --> 23:18.080
she'd stick her head in one of her crosswords

23:18.120 --> 23:19.600
and pretend she wasn't listening.

23:23.760 --> 23:24.760
Look.

23:26.840 --> 23:29.200
I didn't know whether to give you this,

23:29.240 --> 23:32.440
whether I'd be betraying her, but...

23:38.240 --> 23:39.680
Yesterday,

23:39.720 --> 23:42.920
she seemed really on edge. She brought me this envelope,

23:42.960 --> 23:45.080
asked if I'd look after it for a few days.

23:45.120 --> 23:47.880
That's why you went into her house this morning.

23:47.920 --> 23:50.240
You were already worried about her, weren't you?

23:51.200 --> 23:52.880
What is it?

23:52.920 --> 23:57.400
Looks like an emergency escape plan. Money and

23:52.920 --> 23:57.400
an Antiguan passport.

23:57.440 --> 23:59.880
What would she be planning to escape from?

24:01.400 --> 24:03.120
Oh, what's that?

24:05.400 --> 24:06.920
A vet's bill.

24:06.960 --> 24:10.200
Why would she keep a vet's bill

24:06.960 --> 24:10.200
that's two years old?

24:10.240 --> 24:11.960
Knowing how much Nadia loved Harry,

24:12.000 --> 24:14.480
it was to let me know the name of his vet?

24:14.520 --> 24:16.040
Hmm.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.760
Miss Westcott, have you ever heard the name Rose Duchamp?

24:18.800 --> 24:20.400
No. Why?

24:20.440 --> 24:23.560
Because according to this passport,

24:20.440 --> 24:23.560
that was Nadia's name.

24:28.320 --> 24:31.120
RICHARD: So who was Rose Duchamp? Watch out...

24:31.160 --> 24:34.000
And why was she living on Saint-Marie under

24:31.160 --> 24:34.000
a false name?

24:39.520 --> 24:42.880
Okay, let's run the passport through the computer,

24:39.520 --> 24:42.880
see if it's real or not.

24:44.560 --> 24:47.800
Looks like Nadia Selim could be a fake identity.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.560
Fidel, did you speak to any witnesses

24:47.840 --> 24:50.560
who heard the victim's dog

24:50.600 --> 24:52.520
-No.

24:52.560 --> 24:55.280
Far as I can make out, he only barks at strangers.

24:55.320 --> 24:58.360
He didn't bark at all when we went to see

24:55.320 --> 24:58.360
Georgie Westcott just now,

24:58.400 --> 24:59.800
'cause he'd seen us once today already.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.440
Well, he barked at me last night.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.680
Yeah, that's the point. You were a stranger,

25:01.480 --> 25:03.680
and people heard that.

25:03.720 --> 25:05.160
FIDEL: So why didn't he bark at the killer?

25:05.200 --> 25:06.760
Precisely.

25:06.800 --> 25:08.520
Because the dog must have known the killer.

25:08.560 --> 25:10.320
A friend or a neighbour.

25:10.360 --> 25:11.720
Unless you've got a better explanation.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.720
Well, I've been through her laptop.

25:11.760 --> 25:14.720
Nothing special.

25:14.760 --> 25:20.040
Photo and music files and some racy emails

25:14.760 --> 25:20.040
from someone called Big John.

25:20.080 --> 25:21.400
Her employer.

25:21.440 --> 25:25.120
Well, I tell you, some of them even made me blush.

25:25.160 --> 25:27.480
CAMILLE: Okay, that's weird.

25:27.520 --> 25:29.400
Her passport's authentic.

25:29.440 --> 25:32.200
She is Rose Duchamp from Antigua,

25:32.240 --> 25:35.680
but her details are on an intelligence list.

25:35.720 --> 25:37.520
And there's a number we've got to ring

25:37.560 --> 25:39.960
if we have any information about her whereabouts.

25:40.000 --> 25:42.720
-Uh, SOCA.

25:42.760 --> 25:45.480
-SOCA!

25:45.520 --> 25:48.000
Serious Organised Crime Agency, based in London.

25:48.040 --> 25:52.440
But why would they be interested in a finance

25:48.040 --> 25:52.440
director from the Caribbean?

25:52.480 --> 25:54.520
This is Detective Sergeant Camille Bordey

25:54.560 --> 25:57.200
calling from the Honore Police Station on Saint-Marie.

25:57.240 --> 26:01.600
We've got some information about Rose Duchamp and...

26:01.640 --> 26:04.840
Uh, yes, I'll hold.

26:04.880 --> 26:06.400
So what do this SOCA do, exactly?

26:06.440 --> 26:07.640
Serious crime.

26:07.680 --> 26:10.200
The Mafia, Eastern European gangs...

26:10.240 --> 26:12.200
And if she's involved in serious crime,

26:12.240 --> 26:14.640
it goes a long way to explain why she left

26:12.240 --> 26:14.640
Antigua in a hurry

26:14.680 --> 26:17.600
and why she's been living here under a false name.

26:17.640 --> 26:21.240
Until yesterday, when her past may well have caught up

26:17.640 --> 26:21.240
with her.

26:21.280 --> 26:23.920
Uh, okay...

26:25.480 --> 26:26.880
Well?

26:26.920 --> 26:28.840
They said they wouldn't tell me anything

26:26.920 --> 26:28.840
over the phone.

26:30.040 --> 26:32.600
That's, um, a little patronising.

26:32.640 --> 26:36.600
And they've got a case officer on the island already.

26:36.640 --> 26:39.000
What, there's someone already here

26:46.720 --> 26:50.240
DI Chris Ricketts. Sorry I haven't

26:46.720 --> 26:50.240
come forward sooner.

26:50.280 --> 26:53.360
But I just wanted to take stock of everything,

26:50.280 --> 26:53.360
see what was what.

26:53.400 --> 26:55.040
So how long have you been here?

26:58.400 --> 26:59.840
How's London?

26:59.880 --> 27:02.840
Winter's just settling in. You can smell the damp leaves.

27:06.120 --> 27:08.120
It was bitter the morning that I left.

27:08.160 --> 27:11.920
The grass stiff with white frost. You could feel it

27:08.160 --> 27:11.920
crunching underfoot.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.240
It's not like this inferno.

27:14.280 --> 27:15.800
What season is this?

27:18.440 --> 27:21.280
They don't have seasons. It's this hot all year round.

27:21.320 --> 27:22.880
From January to December.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.280
They don't have seasons? How can you have a year

27:22.920 --> 27:25.280
without seasons?

27:25.320 --> 27:27.520
-They don't.

27:27.560 --> 27:30.720
Excuse me. We've got a case to discuss. Remember?

27:30.760 --> 27:33.880
Ah, yes. We were getting to that. It's, um...

27:33.920 --> 27:37.600
well, you know, good manners to exchange

27:33.920 --> 27:37.600
a few pleasantries first.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.160
-Camille's French. -Ah.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.160
So. To business.

27:41.200 --> 27:46.840
Right. Well, two years ago, a woman contacted us

27:41.200 --> 27:46.840
anonymously from Antigua

27:46.880 --> 27:49.600
saying she had information about a money-laundering ring

27:49.640 --> 27:51.440
but didn't know what to do with it.

27:51.480 --> 27:52.920
This was Nadia?

27:54.760 --> 27:56.520
That's right.

27:56.560 --> 27:58.760
She got herself involved with a guy who turned out to be

27:56.560 --> 27:58.760
a money launderer,

27:58.800 --> 28:00.400
quite a big player.

28:00.440 --> 28:02.640
She admitted she'd stolen files

28:00.440 --> 28:02.640
from her boyfriend

28:02.680 --> 28:05.040
that could blow the ring sky-high.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.720
-Well, somebody got to her.

28:07.760 --> 28:10.480
And whoever it was must have frightened the

28:07.760 --> 28:10.480
living daylights out of her,

28:10.520 --> 28:11.960
because she just disappeared.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.760
Vanished into thin air.

28:13.800 --> 28:18.240
That was until two days ago, when she called me

28:13.800 --> 28:18.240
out of the blue.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.960
This man, the one she was going to tell you about,

28:21.000 --> 28:22.280
you think he found her?

28:22.320 --> 28:24.200
She rang off before she could say where she was,

28:24.240 --> 28:28.200
so we put a trace on the call, my boss put me on

28:24.240 --> 28:28.200
a plane and, well,

28:28.240 --> 28:30.600
-here I am. -So she never gave you

28:28.240 --> 28:30.600
the information?

28:30.640 --> 28:34.680
No. You've not found anything, have you?

28:34.720 --> 28:37.920
Files CD?

28:37.960 --> 28:40.400
Laptop, even?

28:40.440 --> 28:45.040
No, we, uh... We checked her work laptop,

28:40.440 --> 28:45.040
but just music.

28:45.080 --> 28:47.520
Some inappropriate emails from her boss.

28:47.560 --> 28:50.680
We're also pretty sure her house was searched

28:47.560 --> 28:50.680
after she was murdered.

28:50.720 --> 28:52.520
RICKETTS: That's it.

28:52.560 --> 28:55.080
Whoever killed her probably took the information

28:52.560 --> 28:55.080
she was holding.

28:55.120 --> 28:58.560
Well, we can't be sure, but it's certainly

28:55.120 --> 28:58.560
a reasonable assumption.

28:58.600 --> 29:00.880
Well, the ex-boyfriend has to be the murderer.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.680
Has there never been anyone else since

29:04.160 --> 29:07.680
you've been here?

29:07.720 --> 29:11.960
Oh, the occasional holiday romance.

29:07.720 --> 29:11.960
Nothing serious.

29:12.000 --> 29:13.760
And was that out of choice

29:14.720 --> 29:16.840
or just how things turned out?

29:16.880 --> 29:18.840
I don't know.

29:18.880 --> 29:22.640
Maybe bite-sized pieces of romance are easier to

29:18.880 --> 29:22.640
digest at my age.

29:23.920 --> 29:26.600
Besides, I enjoy my own company.

29:26.640 --> 29:28.120
I have lots of friends.

29:28.160 --> 29:31.440
So there's nothing you miss about being a couple?

29:32.960 --> 29:34.320
Sometimes.

29:37.240 --> 29:41.080
When I see something funny or read something

29:37.240 --> 29:41.080
in the newspapers,

29:41.120 --> 29:44.040
I turn to tell someone, but there's no one there.

29:44.080 --> 29:45.720
AIDAN: For me it's always the mornings, you know?

29:45.760 --> 29:47.200
I'm still putting two cups on the table,

29:47.240 --> 29:50.920
still putting four slices of bread in the toaster.

29:50.960 --> 29:55.000
That's nothing to do with being lonely. It's just

29:50.960 --> 29:55.000
going senile.

29:58.320 --> 30:01.760
This is DI Chris Ricketts from SOCA in London.

30:01.800 --> 30:03.920
-I saw you this morning. -Yeah, sorry about that.

30:05.400 --> 30:08.920
Autopsy report's in, sir. Death by asphyxiation.

30:08.960 --> 30:11.480
Embedded fibres seem to confirm the pillow was used.

30:11.520 --> 30:13.440
Bruising on her chest suggests that a knee or

30:11.520 --> 30:13.440
forearm was used

30:13.480 --> 30:15.000
to hold her down.

30:15.040 --> 30:17.600
And there were some more coins found lodged down her throat.

30:17.640 --> 30:19.560
Four, to be precise, I'd imagine.

30:19.840 --> 30:21.280
Yes.

30:21.320 --> 30:25.040
As we know, the victim's real name was Rose Duchamp.

30:25.080 --> 30:28.040
And it seems her killer was a man from her past.

30:28.080 --> 30:32.360
We think he's based in Antigua, part of a

30:28.080 --> 30:32.360
money-laundering ring worth...

30:32.400 --> 30:34.320
Hundreds of millions of dollars.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.680
Rose had information that could have

30:34.360 --> 30:37.680
put this man behind bars

30:37.720 --> 30:43.080
and she called London after two years of living

30:37.720 --> 30:43.080
a new life, new identity.

30:43.120 --> 30:45.040
-She was in fear of her life.

30:46.040 --> 30:47.200
You think she saw him?

30:47.240 --> 30:48.760
Do we have a description of this man?

30:48.800 --> 30:50.040
Nothing.

30:50.080 --> 30:52.280
And even if we did, I doubt it would help.

30:52.320 --> 30:53.320
Why not?

30:55.160 --> 30:58.280
For two years, this guy's been one step ahead of us.

30:58.320 --> 31:02.080
If he killed Rose Duchamp in the early hours

30:58.320 --> 31:02.080
of this morning,

31:02.120 --> 31:04.480
he's probably left the island by now.

31:04.520 --> 31:06.200
RICHARD: Not necessarily.

31:06.240 --> 31:09.040
Look, you don't get it. The man is a ghost.

31:09.080 --> 31:12.200
We don't know what he looks like, we don't even know

31:09.080 --> 31:12.200
what he's called.

31:12.240 --> 31:16.560
And the only person who could positively identify him

31:12.240 --> 31:16.560
was murdered this morning.

31:16.600 --> 31:18.600
I think he's almost certainly still on the island.

31:18.640 --> 31:21.440
He's a professional. He's hardly going

31:18.640 --> 31:21.440
to hang around.

31:21.480 --> 31:23.480
RICHARD: That's precisely why he will.

31:23.520 --> 31:25.880
Only an amateur would try to leave the island

31:23.520 --> 31:25.880
within hours

31:25.920 --> 31:29.840
of the murder taking place, thereby drawing

31:25.920 --> 31:29.840
attention to himself.

31:29.880 --> 31:32.880
No. He's still here.

31:32.920 --> 31:35.400
That's why this case has never really got started.

31:35.440 --> 31:37.160
CAMILLE: What?

31:37.200 --> 31:39.360
There was no traction,

31:39.400 --> 31:42.120
no one who quite hit the spot,

31:42.160 --> 31:43.680
because the killer's a professional.

31:43.720 --> 31:45.360
RICKETTS: We don't even know who we're looking for.

31:45.400 --> 31:48.080
Ah, but we do.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.720
We may not know his name or what he looks like,

31:50.760 --> 31:54.120
but we know why he killed Rose Duchamp,

31:50.760 --> 31:54.120
we know how and we know when.

31:54.160 --> 31:56.600
We also know he's still on the island.

31:57.280 --> 31:59.040
Which means,

31:59.080 --> 32:02.680
quite possibly for the first time, we're one step

31:59.080 --> 32:02.680
ahead of him.

32:03.280 --> 32:05.240
DI Ricketts,

32:05.280 --> 32:08.040
can you give us access to the existing files and help us

32:05.280 --> 32:08.040
to know what you know?

32:08.080 --> 32:09.280
Yes, yes, of course.

32:09.320 --> 32:12.280
-You can use my desk, sir.

32:12.320 --> 32:14.080
RICHARD: Check with the airlines.

32:14.120 --> 32:16.120
See if you can get a passenger list

32:14.120 --> 32:16.120
for all flights from Antigua

32:16.160 --> 32:17.520
-during the past month. -Okay.

32:17.560 --> 32:20.200
Dwayne, background. Run checks on

32:17.560 --> 32:20.200
all the neighbours.

32:20.240 --> 32:23.080
See if any of them have links to Antigua just in case

32:20.240 --> 32:23.080
he wasn't working alone.

32:23.120 --> 32:24.760
-Yes, Chief. -Anyone needs me,

32:24.800 --> 32:26.080
I'll be at the crime scene.

32:37.680 --> 32:40.760
Detective Inspector. Just the man.

32:40.800 --> 32:42.960
Actually, I'm in something of a hurry, sir.

32:43.000 --> 32:45.360
-Five minutes. -Well, I...

32:47.440 --> 32:49.560
-All right. -Not in there.

32:50.640 --> 32:53.200
Come on. I'll buy you a cold drink.

33:02.960 --> 33:04.560
Hi!

33:04.600 --> 33:07.080
You'll have to get yourself your drinks.

33:07.120 --> 33:10.160
Aidan's cooked me a farewell lunch.

33:10.200 --> 33:11.640
He flies home tomorrow.

33:11.680 --> 33:14.840
AIDAN: Yeah, well, I'm sure I'll be back, you know.

33:14.880 --> 33:16.200
It's very beautiful here.

33:18.800 --> 33:20.280
Oh, sorry. My manners.

33:20.320 --> 33:24.560
Aidan, this is Camille's boss, Inspector Poole.

33:24.600 --> 33:26.320
-Inspector. -Richard, please.

33:29.320 --> 33:32.800
Camille likes to talk, um, a lot.

33:32.840 --> 33:34.920
Family trait.

33:34.960 --> 33:38.760
And this is Selwyn Patterson, the Police Commissioner

33:34.960 --> 33:38.760
for Saint-Marie.

33:38.800 --> 33:40.400
Aidan Miles, pleasure to meet you.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.400
Please, don't let us disturb your lunch.

33:49.200 --> 33:52.200
This is all a bit cloak-and-dagger,

33:49.200 --> 33:52.200
isn't it?

33:53.840 --> 33:59.760
I, uh... I have something I need to talk to you about.

33:59.800 --> 34:01.000
Oh?

34:02.240 --> 34:03.760
What's this?

34:03.800 --> 34:08.120
I've been talking to your superintendent

34:03.800 --> 34:08.120
in London.

34:08.160 --> 34:10.280
The detective they have brought in to cover for you

34:10.320 --> 34:12.080
has finished his attachment.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.560
Sorry, I don't understand.

34:15.600 --> 34:17.720
It's a Human Resources thing.

34:17.760 --> 34:21.240
Before they can offer him the position permanently,

34:21.280 --> 34:27.080
the Met guidelines state that you must be offered

34:21.280 --> 34:27.080
the position first.

34:28.360 --> 34:29.760
What?

34:29.800 --> 34:32.560
That's the number for the Human Resources officer

34:32.600 --> 34:35.080
dealing with the case.

34:35.120 --> 34:38.680
If you ring up, you can have your old job back.

34:44.120 --> 34:47.000
I can have my old job back?

34:47.040 --> 34:50.480
I can go back to London and not be hot or

34:47.040 --> 34:50.480
have sand everywhere?

34:50.800 --> 34:52.760
Yes.

34:52.800 --> 34:55.760
Or, of course, you could stay here.

34:58.080 --> 35:00.400
I could go to the White Hart,

35:00.440 --> 35:03.400
sit in the snug with a pint in my hand.

35:03.440 --> 35:05.080
Yes, you could.

35:07.120 --> 35:11.760
I thought it best I told you alone to give you time

35:07.120 --> 35:11.760
to make your decision.

35:12.600 --> 35:16.280
No. Yeah, yeah. Absolutely.

35:16.320 --> 35:18.640
No, I shall have to think long and hard. Yep.

35:19.880 --> 35:21.320
Ooh, it's a tough one.

35:21.360 --> 35:25.440
But, um, you'll have to phone today.

35:27.280 --> 35:29.160
What?

35:29.200 --> 35:33.360
The last day they can keep the job offer

35:29.200 --> 35:33.360
open for you is today,

35:33.400 --> 35:36.440
6 p.m., UK time.

35:36.480 --> 35:39.320
That's in, um, two hours.

35:39.360 --> 35:41.120
Whoa, whoa. What?

35:42.680 --> 35:45.880
And when exactly did the Super ring you with this news?

35:45.920 --> 35:47.760
-Uh...

35:47.800 --> 35:50.160
not as such. No.

35:50.200 --> 35:52.040
And it wasn't yesterday, was it?

35:52.800 --> 35:54.240
No.

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
It was long before today, but you didn't want

35:54.280 --> 35:56.280
me to know.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.080
You were hoping it would go away.

35:58.120 --> 36:00.760
You're leading a good team here,

35:58.120 --> 36:00.760
Detective Inspector.

36:00.800 --> 36:02.080
That's no excuse.

36:03.000 --> 36:04.240
I'd like you to stay.

36:08.000 --> 36:09.640
I want to go home.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.920
I know.

36:13.960 --> 36:16.640
Then I suggest you make the call.

36:22.120 --> 36:23.320
-Oh! -Oh!

36:23.360 --> 36:24.800
-Sorry. Can't stop! -I was just...

36:24.840 --> 36:27.280
There's a call I've got to make!

36:28.640 --> 36:30.720
DWAYNE: Oh, you'll be the best dad, Fidel.

36:30.760 --> 36:33.440
But he'll need his Uncle Dwayne to teach

36:30.760 --> 36:33.440
him about a few things.

36:33.480 --> 36:35.160
FIDEL: Oh, really

36:35.200 --> 36:38.560
Women, motorbikes, climbing trees.

36:38.600 --> 36:42.040
I can climb trees. Hello? Sorry. Yes.

36:42.080 --> 36:44.760
This is Officer Fidel Best calling from

36:42.080 --> 36:44.760
Honore Police Station.

36:44.800 --> 36:47.320
That was quick, Chief.

36:47.360 --> 36:50.320
If we cross-reference the passenger list

36:47.360 --> 36:50.320
against the hotels,

36:50.360 --> 36:51.800
see where they were staying,

36:51.840 --> 36:54.280
we can find out who can account for their movements

36:54.320 --> 36:56.800
and we can dismiss a huge amount of them.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.080
-CAMILLE: Women, children,

36:56.840 --> 37:00.080
elderly.

37:00.120 --> 37:01.680
DWAYNE: Good thinking.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.360
But the truth is we've no way of knowing

37:03.400 --> 37:06.080
whether he got the information Rose was hiding or not.

37:06.120 --> 37:07.600
We have to assume he has.

37:07.640 --> 37:10.160
I'm sorry, but how can we expect to solve this puzzle

37:10.200 --> 37:12.800
if Inspector Ricketts has been on it for years

37:10.200 --> 37:12.800
and not got anywhere?

37:14.440 --> 37:16.200
Wait.

37:16.240 --> 37:17.240
You get something? Ooh.

37:24.880 --> 37:26.080
Well, that's, um...

37:30.000 --> 37:31.960
Ooh!

37:32.000 --> 37:34.040
FIDEL:<i> Selim. It means "safe".</i>

37:34.600 --> 37:35.760
Uh...

37:35.800 --> 37:37.600
CAMILLE:<i> Nadia Selim,</i> <i>30 years old.</i>

37:37.640 --> 37:39.560
<i>Lived at this address</i> <i>for a little under two years.</i>

37:39.600 --> 37:40.800
Of course.

37:43.800 --> 37:44.800
Mmm.

37:47.360 --> 37:49.880
Why would she keep a vet's bill that's

37:47.360 --> 37:49.880
two years old?

37:51.760 --> 37:54.360
Oh ho!

37:54.880 --> 37:56.440
Oh!

37:56.480 --> 37:58.000
Oh, that's brilliant!

38:00.160 --> 38:01.960
Oh, that's superb!

38:06.160 --> 38:08.440
Nearly two hours.

38:08.480 --> 38:11.560
I've got time. Uh, right. Um, exciting news.

38:11.600 --> 38:14.160
Well, at least, exciting for me.

38:14.200 --> 38:18.840
Uh, so I'll stop being English and buy you all a drink.

38:18.880 --> 38:22.760
Meet me across the road to say<i> bon voyage.</i>

38:22.800 --> 38:24.600
Yeah.

38:24.640 --> 38:27.040
In one hour. Only, I've got to go pick up Georgie Westcott

38:24.640 --> 38:27.040
first, yeah?

38:27.080 --> 38:29.840
So I'll see you there. Drinks are on me!

38:39.880 --> 38:41.480
CATHERINE: Thank you.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.600
I wouldn't mind, you know.

38:47.640 --> 38:50.640
-If you wanted him to move in.

38:50.680 --> 38:52.040
I can find a place.

38:52.080 --> 38:54.080
Thank you, but we're a little way from that yet.

38:54.800 --> 38:56.360
Just a little way?

38:57.840 --> 38:59.680
I heard he cooked you lasagne.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.240
Which was very nice.

39:01.280 --> 39:03.000
I'm happy you're not alone.

39:03.040 --> 39:05.360
Hearing you laugh, watching you dance.

39:05.400 --> 39:07.280
Oh, I always dance.

39:07.320 --> 39:10.560
Why are you arguing with me? I'm trying to give you

39:07.320 --> 39:10.560
my blessing here.

39:11.280 --> 39:12.800
I know.

39:14.240 --> 39:17.080
-Thank you. -But I'm not calling him Dad.

39:17.120 --> 39:18.880
Ah.

39:18.920 --> 39:21.160
Sorry, everyone. Sorry.

39:22.400 --> 39:24.080
Half an hour left. Perfect.

39:24.120 --> 39:27.280
Uh, I might have to jump around a bit

39:27.320 --> 39:31.280
because, uh, well, I never really looked at it

39:27.320 --> 39:31.280
the way it was designed,

39:31.320 --> 39:32.480
as a puzzle.

39:32.520 --> 39:35.560
Once I did, I got it. -At least I think I have.

39:38.680 --> 39:40.600
I think I know where to find our killer.

39:40.640 --> 39:43.560
-How exciting! -Should we really be

39:40.640 --> 39:43.560
doing this here?

39:43.600 --> 39:45.440
Well, yes, because as soon as we're done,

39:45.480 --> 39:46.840
then I've got an announcement to make,

39:46.880 --> 39:48.240
so we'd only have to come back here anyway,

39:48.280 --> 39:50.600
so I thought we may as well, um, you know...

39:50.640 --> 39:54.040
-Hey, that's the Chief.

39:54.080 --> 39:59.480
This case has been a puzzle right from the start,

39:54.080 --> 39:59.480
quite literally.

39:59.520 --> 40:01.680
Firstly, the murderer of Nadia as you knew her,

40:01.720 --> 40:03.880
Rose Duchamp as she really was,

40:03.920 --> 40:06.880
was carried out with the kind of professional attention

40:03.920 --> 40:06.880
to detail

40:06.920 --> 40:09.800
none of the suspects we could find were capable of.

40:09.840 --> 40:12.560
But according to Inspector Ricketts,

40:12.600 --> 40:17.240
we know that Rose came to Saint-Marie to run away

40:12.600 --> 40:17.240
from her past,

40:17.280 --> 40:22.920
more specifically, the lover she discovered

40:17.280 --> 40:22.920
to be a criminal.

40:22.960 --> 40:26.160
She at first intended to hand him over to the police,

40:26.200 --> 40:29.880
but was clearly got to before arrangements could be made.

40:29.920 --> 40:31.720
Um...

40:31.760 --> 40:34.280
it's strange that someone managed to get to her

40:31.760 --> 40:34.280
so easily

40:34.320 --> 40:38.000
if she was under police protection,

40:34.320 --> 40:38.000
don't you think?

40:38.040 --> 40:42.240
But can we be sure that it was Rose's criminal ex-lover

40:38.040 --> 40:42.240
that murdered her

40:42.280 --> 40:47.480
and not the lascivious boss or the cranky neighbour,

40:42.280 --> 40:47.480
Jacko Gardiner,

40:47.520 --> 40:51.440
or the somewhat resentful friend,

40:47.520 --> 40:51.440
Georgie Westcott?

40:53.000 --> 40:54.440
I think we can.

40:54.480 --> 40:59.280
You see, the biggest clue to the identity of the killer

40:59.320 --> 41:03.000
was the coins found stuffed in the victim's mouth.

41:03.040 --> 41:05.000
On the surface, something of a random act.

41:05.040 --> 41:08.400
Until you realise there were 26 coins,

41:08.440 --> 41:11.080
plus a further four found lodged in her throat.

41:11.120 --> 41:13.400
Thirty pieces of silver.

41:13.440 --> 41:17.840
Judas. So this was a message that she was killed

41:13.440 --> 41:17.840
for betraying someone.

41:17.880 --> 41:19.680
Exactly that.

41:19.720 --> 41:22.680
Someone who wanted others to know the penalty for

41:19.720 --> 41:22.680
such a betrayal.

41:23.720 --> 41:25.960
And we have mystery number two.

41:26.000 --> 41:28.760
The house was searched, so the killer was

41:26.000 --> 41:28.760
clearly looking for something.

41:28.800 --> 41:29.800
But what?

41:31.400 --> 41:33.160
Logically, it had to be the information

41:33.200 --> 41:35.440
we're told Rose had promised the police.

41:35.480 --> 41:37.760
-Makes sense. -Hmm.

41:37.800 --> 41:43.720
But Rose gave an envelope to her neighbour

41:37.800 --> 41:43.720
for safekeeping.

41:43.760 --> 41:46.720
So it occurred to me, if she knew that

41:43.760 --> 41:46.720
she was in danger,

41:46.760 --> 41:48.080
that her past had caught up with her,

41:48.120 --> 41:51.840
then why leave the information in the house?

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
Why not give it to her neighbour for safekeeping

41:51.880 --> 41:53.880
as well?

41:55.080 --> 41:58.360
And then it hit me. That's exactly what she did.

41:58.400 --> 42:01.200
When the killer broke into Rose's house last night,

42:01.240 --> 42:04.880
he had no idea that the key piece of information

42:01.240 --> 42:04.880
he needed wasn't there.

42:07.320 --> 42:11.560
I think he saw Rose with a policeman and

42:07.320 --> 42:11.560
knew he had to act.

42:15.720 --> 42:18.760
Obviously the locks on the door didn't prove too much

42:15.720 --> 42:18.760
of an obstacle to him.

42:24.040 --> 42:26.640
We know that Harry, Rose's dog,

42:24.040 --> 42:26.640
barked at strangers,

42:26.680 --> 42:30.680
yet none of the witnesses heard a dog barking

42:26.680 --> 42:30.680
after midnight.

42:30.720 --> 42:32.840
So we can be sure that Harry knew the killer.

42:37.440 --> 42:39.680
And as Rose brought the dog with her from Antigua,

42:39.720 --> 42:41.680
I'm assuming he recognised the killer instantly.

42:42.520 --> 42:45.560
In fact, I'd hazard a guess

42:45.600 --> 42:48.040
that Harry here will run straight to the killer.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.480
CAMILLE: You mean, the killer's here?

42:50.520 --> 42:52.080
RICHARD: Oh, yes.

42:52.120 --> 42:55.840
In fact, he was here last night, which is why

42:52.120 --> 42:55.840
Rose was frightened.

42:55.880 --> 42:58.400
Why, when she saw a police officer,

42:58.440 --> 43:01.880
she made sure she made him take her home.

43:01.920 --> 43:05.080
Wait, you said Rose left some information

43:01.920 --> 43:05.080
with a neighbour.

43:05.120 --> 43:07.640
I thought it was just cash and a passport.

43:07.680 --> 43:08.680
Yeah.

43:10.880 --> 43:11.920
And this.

43:14.560 --> 43:15.720
A vet's bill.

43:15.760 --> 43:19.640
$75 for identity-chipping Harry.

43:19.680 --> 43:21.160
But if you accept that the victim

43:21.200 --> 43:23.480
gave her neighbour all her most valued possessions,

43:23.520 --> 43:26.680
then the very thing that brought her to Saint-Marie

43:23.520 --> 43:26.680
must also be in there.

43:26.720 --> 43:28.800
And if it wasn't the passport or the cash,

43:28.840 --> 43:33.160
then it had to be this vet's bill.

43:33.200 --> 43:37.440
It wasn't until an hour ago that it occurred to me

43:33.200 --> 43:37.440
how she did it.

43:37.480 --> 43:40.440
So Georgie and I took Harry to see the vet,

43:40.480 --> 43:42.960
to have the chip removed.

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
Only to discover that it wasn't a pet identity chip,

43:43.000 --> 43:48.000
it was a memory chip,

43:48.040 --> 43:50.520
no doubt containing all the incriminating files

43:50.560 --> 43:53.480
Rose had told the police in Antigua about.

43:53.520 --> 43:56.800
I'm sure the identity of Rose Duchamp's killer

43:53.520 --> 43:56.800
is on here,

43:56.840 --> 43:58.560
along with enough evidence to convict him.

43:58.600 --> 44:01.480
So all we have to do is run it through the computer?

44:01.520 --> 44:06.040
Yes. But, uh, she left us one last clue.

44:06.080 --> 44:09.760
You see, uh, Rose was incredibly bright.

44:09.800 --> 44:14.440
She loved to play games, solve puzzles.

44:16.720 --> 44:20.520
And the final clue is the most damning of all.

44:20.560 --> 44:23.920
It's also the simplest to solve, once you know how.

44:23.960 --> 44:25.480
RICKETTS: So what is it?

44:25.520 --> 44:28.800
She knew that if anything

44:25.520 --> 44:28.800
happened to her,

44:28.840 --> 44:33.120
it was the last chance she had to expose the person

44:28.840 --> 44:33.120
she was running from.

44:33.160 --> 44:36.080
It was the name she gave herself when she came

44:33.160 --> 44:36.080
to Saint-Marie.

44:36.840 --> 44:37.840
Nadia...

44:40.160 --> 44:42.080
Selim.

44:47.680 --> 44:48.680
Anyone?

44:54.120 --> 44:55.840
You see, any good crossword enthusiast,

44:55.880 --> 44:58.440
as Rose was, knows to look out for an anagram.

44:58.480 --> 45:00.400
Or, as in this case,

45:02.160 --> 45:04.880
words that work equally well

45:05.880 --> 45:07.640
when spelt backwards.

45:13.320 --> 45:15.000
It was you, Aidan, wasn't it?

45:17.400 --> 45:18.400
You killed Rose Duchamp.

45:19.880 --> 45:21.520
<i>It was you who approached her</i> <i>in her sleep</i>

45:21.560 --> 45:23.360
<i>and killed her</i> <i>before searching her house.</i>

45:23.400 --> 45:24.960
<i>You're the man</i> <i>she was running from,</i>

45:25.000 --> 45:27.520
<i>the ex-boyfriend at the heart</i> <i>of the money-laundering ring</i>

45:27.560 --> 45:29.560
<i>who she's finally exposed.</i>

45:31.880 --> 45:33.640
You came to Saint-Marie almost two weeks ago,

45:33.680 --> 45:36.840
you've been looking for Rose ever since you got here.

45:36.880 --> 45:38.200
You found her last night.

46:01.800 --> 46:03.000
Take him away.

46:06.120 --> 46:08.360
-Took us one day.

46:09.800 --> 46:11.480
Well, at least I get to go home.

46:13.320 --> 46:14.800
Home!

46:14.840 --> 46:16.360
What did I do with the paper?

46:16.400 --> 46:18.920
Hold on, wait. Hold on. Sir? Uh, the baby's coming.

46:18.960 --> 46:21.200
-Juliet, you know, she's...

46:21.240 --> 46:22.360
The baby, it's coming!

46:22.400 --> 46:25.480
-Then go! -Yeah! Go, go, go!

46:25.520 --> 46:27.200
You process him, I'll bring the car round.

46:27.240 --> 46:28.760
-No, no. I'll process him,

46:28.800 --> 46:30.240
you bring the car round.

46:30.280 --> 46:32.240
I'll lock him up, then we'll follow Fidel.

47:03.440 --> 47:05.560
I don't seem to have any signal. Uh...

47:05.600 --> 47:07.880
I don't suppose anybody else has got any, have they?

47:07.920 --> 47:09.640
What's more important than Fidel's baby?

47:10.960 --> 47:13.640
Sir

47:18.480 --> 47:20.000
No, sorry.

47:27.880 --> 47:29.280
-I'm a daddy! -Oh!

47:29.320 --> 47:31.800
-DWAYNE: Well done, Fidel.

47:43.440 --> 47:44.440
So.

47:46.000 --> 47:48.880
-You know I didn't.

47:50.000 --> 47:53.440
Good. You decided to stay.

47:53.480 --> 47:55.360
No, not exactly, I just couldn't...

47:57.560 --> 47:59.360
I'm sorry, sir, but you've tricked me again.

47:59.400 --> 48:01.160
I find that very underhand.

48:01.200 --> 48:04.080
Would you like to make an official complaint?

48:04.120 --> 48:06.720
-The Police Commissioner.

48:06.760 --> 48:09.200
-Yes.

48:34.880 --> 48:36.920
Congratulations, Fidel. Very happy for you.

48:36.960 --> 48:38.400
Thank you, sir.

48:38.440 --> 48:40.520
There's nothing quite as glorious as a new life.

48:40.560 --> 48:42.240
No.

48:42.280 --> 48:44.080
You can hold her, sir, if you want.

48:44.120 --> 48:46.640
Oh, uh, actually...

48:46.680 --> 48:48.480
Never held a baby before, so...

48:48.520 --> 48:50.120
Then it's about time you did.

48:50.160 --> 48:51.160
Uh...

48:52.480 --> 48:54.160
Yes. Great.

48:54.200 --> 48:56.200
Oh, hello.

48:59.360 --> 49:00.560
Aww.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.600
Oh, God, she's just been sick on me.

49:02.680 --> 49:05.600
Sorry, what do I do now?

49:05.640 --> 49:06.920
It's okay. I'll take her.

49:06.960 --> 49:09.640
Yeah, yeah. Please do. Please. Sorry. So sorry.

49:09.680 --> 49:11.920
I made her sick. Oh.

49:11.960 --> 49:15.400
Murderers! I'm so much more comfortable with murderers

49:11.960 --> 49:15.400
than I am with babies.

49:15.440 --> 49:17.240
FIDEL: Don't worry, I'll take her back to her mother.

49:23.840 --> 49:25.000
<i>Maman?</i>

49:26.920 --> 49:30.200
-I'm always all right.

49:30.240 --> 49:32.160
-Good night, Richard. -Good night.

49:42.040 --> 49:43.040
Hello? Over here!

50:00.000 --> 50:01.120
Thanks.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.600
Aren't you going to sit down?

50:05.800 --> 50:08.800
-Uh, yeah.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.240
-Yes.

50:16.280 --> 50:18.480
I was starting to think you'd loosened up a bit.

50:18.880 --> 50:20.480
I have.

50:20.520 --> 50:24.320
I mean, sitting on the beach, beer in hand, free spirit...

50:24.360 --> 50:25.640
I'm virtually feral.

50:26.200 --> 50:27.200
Hardly.

50:29.520 --> 50:33.200
All the time you've been here, have you learnt anything?

50:33.240 --> 50:34.400
You've changed your opinion maybe?

50:39.240 --> 50:40.680
Yeah, there is something I've realised.

50:40.720 --> 50:44.240
Something I suppose it's taken me a long time to notice.

50:44.760 --> 50:46.400
Yes?

50:46.440 --> 50:48.480
Something I've really come to appreciate

50:46.440 --> 50:48.480
more than I thought I would.

50:49.520 --> 50:52.160
-My own company.

50:58.600 --> 51:01.240
-Nothing.

51:02.800 --> 51:04.440
That is so annoying.

51:04.480 --> 51:06.320
-Yes.

51:06.360 --> 51:07.800
You're so English!

51:07.840 --> 51:09.720
Being English doesn't mean you're annoying.

51:09.760 --> 51:11.720
Oh, yes, it does.

51:11.760 --> 51:15.880
Well, if you don't mind me saying so, I think

51:11.760 --> 51:15.880
that's very childish.

51:18.520 --> 51:20.240
And what has being French got to do with it?

51:20.280 --> 51:22.320
-You started it. -No, I didn't.

51:27.840 --> 51:30.200
Stop laughing! I'm dying here! I've got sand in my eye!

51:30.240 --> 51:31.520
CAMILLE: Oh, stop being a baby.
