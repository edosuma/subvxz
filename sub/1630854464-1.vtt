[speaking French] Bonjour.

00:53.458 --> 00:57.666
[Pip] Once upon a time
in a magical kingdom called Andalasia,

00:57.750 --> 01:00.291
a baby was found in the forest.

01:01.083 --> 01:03.375
With no mother or father to speak of,

01:03.458 --> 01:08.583
the baby was raised by the animals,
who loved her as one of their own.

01:08.666 --> 01:11.958
-[babbles]
-[Pip] And her name was Giselle.

01:13.041 --> 01:15.916
Giselle grew into a beautiful young lady…

01:16.000 --> 01:19.166
with a loving heart and a secret desire.

Until one day, she won the love

01:33.458 --> 01:39.250
But then, Giselle was pushed
through a portal by an Evil Queen

01:39.333 --> 01:43.583
and landed in a strange
and extremely confusing kingdom called…

who was a lawyer with dreamy eyes

01:52.458 --> 01:57.083
and a daughter named Morgan,
who saw magic everywhere she went.

01:57.166 --> 01:59.583
So Giselle and Robert fell in love.

What if I told you that "ever after"
wasn't the end of their story?

-[grunts]
-Oh!

02:18.083 --> 02:20.083
We've heard this story a million times.

That's how it always ends.

02:21.958 --> 02:24.041
Uh, uh, uh.
You only heard part of the story.

02:25.041 --> 02:27.916
See, it turns out, New York wasn't
Giselle's happily-ever-after after all.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.041
-Huh?
-What? Huh?

02:29.125 --> 02:31.625
Well, I'm not too proud
of my part in this one,

I'll read it to ya.

02:33.958 --> 02:34.958
[both giggle]

02:35.041 --> 02:38.166
This story begins
where the old one left off:

02:38.250 --> 02:41.916
in the kingdom of New York
after "happily ever after."

02:42.000 --> 02:45.791
After? But there is no after,
after "happily ever after."

02:45.875 --> 02:51.250
Yeah. You just get married
then nothing ever happens to you again.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.166
Oh, not in this world.

02:53.250 --> 02:55.791
Over there,
things would never stop happening.

02:55.875 --> 02:58.166
For Giselle, a few years went by.

02:58.250 --> 03:02.875
Morgan sprouted up, and eventually,
Robert and Giselle had a baby.

03:02.958 --> 03:05.583
A beautiful girl named Sofia.

03:05.666 --> 03:08.916
And for one moment,
Giselle truly had it all.

03:10.958 --> 03:13.375
And that's when things began to change.

03:13.916 --> 03:18.416
First, with all the baby stuff,
their castle in the sky shrunk two sizes.

03:18.500 --> 03:20.375
Then, life got so busy,

03:20.458 --> 03:23.833
it felt like a sleeping curse
fell over them every single night.

03:24.416 --> 03:27.166
But the hardest part of all was Morgan.

03:27.666 --> 03:31.791
She became what that world calls
a "teenager."

03:32.541 --> 03:36.041
And it felt to Giselle
that she had set out to a faraway place

03:36.125 --> 03:37.750
where she could never go.

03:38.375 --> 03:41.041
With so much change,
Giselle started feeling

03:41.125 --> 03:45.000
that life in the kingdom of New York
wasn't such a fairy tale after all.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.583
And that's when she saw… a sign.

03:49.666 --> 03:51.375
And, suddenly, she realized

03:51.458 --> 03:54.458
their happily-ever-after
might be somewhere else.

03:55.125 --> 03:59.541
So, Giselle and Robert began their quest
for a new happily-ever-after.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.375
All right. Next stop: "Monroeville."

04:08.458 --> 04:10.000
Where the hell's Monroeville?

04:12.000 --> 04:13.000
I don't know.

04:13.958 --> 04:15.625
It's got to be better than here.

04:18.666 --> 04:23.166
[Giselle] I know that change can be scary,
but it can also be exciting.

04:23.250 --> 04:26.083
Think of all of the wonderful new people
you're going to meet

04:26.166 --> 04:28.583
who will love you just as much as I do.

04:29.291 --> 04:32.958

[clears throat]

04:56.916 --> 04:59.791
-Morgan, can you try and help out here?
-[typing]

04:59.875 --> 05:03.125
I am helping. I'm literally telling
the entire Internet about my kidnapping.

05:03.208 --> 05:04.583
Everyone agrees it's a tragedy.

05:04.666 --> 05:07.291
You know, a lot of people move
to the suburbs from the city,

05:07.375 --> 05:08.833
and they're wildly happy.

05:08.916 --> 05:11.416
Yeah, well, I was wildly happy here.

05:11.500 --> 05:13.083
Can you back me up on this, Sofia?

05:13.166 --> 05:14.500
[babbles]

05:14.583 --> 05:15.875
You are no help.

05:15.958 --> 05:18.333
So, who's excited for our new adventure?

05:18.416 --> 05:19.791
-Very excited.
-[gasps]

05:20.958 --> 05:24.000
-Oh, that's… sarcasm.
-Sarcasm, yeah.

05:24.583 --> 05:29.000
But, Morgan, I promise,
Monroeville is the perfect place.

05:29.083 --> 05:31.791
Perfect for you, maybe.
Not so much for me.

05:32.541 --> 05:35.000
-Morgan--
-Ah, ah, ah. No speeches.

05:35.083 --> 05:37.083
If we're gonna do this, let's just go.

05:38.708 --> 05:40.875
Teenagers are like this. She'll be fine.

05:42.041 --> 05:44.000
I hope so. [sighs]

05:44.875 --> 05:47.458
We really did have magic memories here,
didn't we?

05:47.541 --> 05:49.250
We did. And we'll have more.

05:49.958 --> 05:53.583
Trust me, if I learned anything
from meeting a princess on a billboard,

05:53.666 --> 05:56.291
it's that sometimes
you just have to take a leap.

22:00.166 --> 22:02.833
[Rosaleen] Her son Tyson's won prince
three years in a row.

22:02.916 --> 22:05.291
Even when he broke both his legs,
he still won.

-It's not rigged. I promise.
-Mm-mmm.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.500
I think it sounds wonderful.

22:10.000 --> 22:12.916
I love festivals. We have them
all the time where I come from.

22:13.000 --> 22:14.000
-Mmm.
-Ah!

22:14.083 --> 22:16.541
They were usually interrupted
by evil forces of some kind,

22:16.625 --> 22:19.708
but when they weren't,
it really brought people together.

22:19.791 --> 22:22.583
-Aha.
-I would love to help if you need it.

22:22.666 --> 22:24.791
You actually should take her up on that.

22:24.875 --> 22:27.125
This one time she made a forest
entirely out of M&M's

22:27.208 --> 22:28.916
and had it delivered
to my class by pigeon.

22:29.000 --> 22:30.541
-[Giselle] That's right.
-[Morgan laughs] Yeah.

22:30.625 --> 22:32.541

I'd love to buy you a coffee

As you can see, Giselle,
our town is really just one big family.

24:36.375 --> 24:39.833
And like a family,
everyone has their place in it.

24:39.916 --> 24:40.916

It was fine.

[Morgan sighs]

25:25.083 --> 25:26.708
Does this mean it didn't go well?

25:26.791 --> 25:30.833
Well, no one talked to me all day,
so I got a lot of me-time. That was nice.

25:30.916 --> 25:31.750
Oh.

25:31.833 --> 25:33.708
Yes, that was sarcasm. My day sucked.

25:38.458 --> 25:41.958
Well, this isn't anything
a little glitter couldn't fix.

25:42.041 --> 25:43.625
It's old anyway. What's the point?

25:43.708 --> 25:48.041
The point is, is that it's a memory tree,
and as we say in Andalasia--

25:48.125 --> 25:51.125
"Memories are the most powerful magic
of all." I know.

25:51.208 --> 25:53.125

it works the same way here.

it will get better.

26:04.875 --> 26:05.875
What if it doesn't?

26:05.958 --> 26:08.750
I should go back to school in New York.
I can take the train with Dad.

-It'll be fine.
-It's only been a day.

26:11.750 --> 26:15.041
We just have to figure out
where you fit in.

We won't do anything, okay?

26:17.708 --> 26:20.541

27:37.875 --> 27:40.416
in Andalasia,
we have festivals all the time,

27:40.500 --> 27:43.041
and everybody knows
the prince and the princess.

27:43.125 --> 27:44.375
And now everyone will know you.

27:44.458 --> 27:47.833

that I could figure this out on my own.

I'm sorry, Giselle, but you can't have
a table on school property

unless you're an official member
of a committee.

28:00.416 --> 28:02.500
Oh, well, I'm sorry. I didn't know.

28:02.583 --> 28:04.083
Well, now you do.

-Gladly.

She used to beg me for stories
from Andalasia every night,

28:32.000 --> 28:35.500
and her favorite ones were always
about the Magical Memory Tree.

28:35.583 --> 28:37.416
She used to love those.

28:38.958 --> 28:40.291
I don't know what happened.

28:40.375 --> 28:42.041
Oh, nothing happened.

28:42.125 --> 28:44.666

29:28.500 --> 29:30.083
It's not that I'm unhappy.

29:31.375 --> 29:32.833

29:35.250 --> 29:36.625
if time's just slipping away,

29:36.708 --> 29:42.333

and over again for the rest of my life.

-I went to New York.
-By yourself?

I've been riding the subway alone
since I was 13. Let's calm down, please.

29:52.083 --> 29:54.375
Don't tell me to calm down.

29:54.458 --> 29:56.125
-What were you thinking?
-I don't know, Dad.

29:56.208 --> 29:58.791
I was thinking, though, maybe
you should have left me where I belong.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.166
You belong here.

30:00.250 --> 30:01.708
No, I don't!

Look, I know that you want to live in some
perfect fairy-tale land, but we don't.

-Okay? We live here…
-If you want to be mad, you be mad at me.

30:09.541 --> 30:12.791
-…in this stupid town, and I hate it!
-But do not talk to your mother like that!

30:12.875 --> 30:14.083
My mother?

30:14.166 --> 30:15.083
Mm-hmm.

-Okay, well, I'm off to market,

46:57.625 --> 47:00.666
and then I'll have plenty of time
to get ready for the festival.

47:00.750 --> 47:02.083
-[Morgan chuckles]
-Mm-hmm.

47:03.083 --> 47:04.291
-Oh!
-Hmm?

47:05.333 --> 47:07.208
Thank you for everything, Stepmother.

47:13.375 --> 47:14.458
Stepmother?

47:15.083 --> 47:16.333
[gasps]

47:17.541 --> 47:18.750
Oh, no.

47:19.375 --> 47:20.375
What?

47:20.458 --> 47:21.541
[gasps]

47:21.625 --> 47:23.541
-What?
-Oh! [gasps]

47:23.625 --> 47:26.333
My hair, it's so high,
and my dress is so low.

47:26.416 --> 47:28.791
And of course,
I want that dress to be made of rags.

47:28.875 --> 47:30.416
People like me always do.

47:30.500 --> 47:32.375
People like who?
What are you talking about?

47:33.000 --> 47:34.125
Oh, no, Pip.

47:35.000 --> 47:37.375
I'm afraid that my wish
is turning me into a-- [gasps]

47:37.458 --> 47:38.291
A what?

47:39.250 --> 47:40.708
It's turning me into a… [gasps]

47:40.791 --> 47:41.666
A what?

47:41.750 --> 47:43.083
[breathes shakily]

47:44.166 --> 47:45.833
A wicked stepmother. [gasps]

47:45.916 --> 47:48.041
What? Come on!

47:48.625 --> 47:49.833
[gasps]

47:49.916 --> 47:52.166
Oh, actually. Yeah. No.
No, no, I can totally see it.

47:52.750 --> 47:54.791
Oh, no. [gasps] Oh, Pip!

47:56.041 --> 47:58.625
[Pip] Uh, hey, slow down!
Where are we going?

48:00.708 --> 48:01.708
[gasps]

48:07.750 --> 48:09.375
Who lives in this rat hole?

48:09.958 --> 48:11.208
Morgan does.

48:11.875 --> 48:14.750
Stepdaughters always live
in attics or dungeons.

48:14.833 --> 48:17.000
Oh, Pip, do you know what this means?

48:17.083 --> 48:19.416
I am the villain of Monrolasia!

48:19.500 --> 48:21.416
Well, you're not the only villain.

48:21.500 --> 48:24.458
Well, that's silly.
There can only ever be one villain.

48:25.083 --> 48:27.541
Not counting minions or pets.

48:28.375 --> 48:30.916
Or villains that you don't know
are villains until it's too late.

48:31.000 --> 48:32.875
[Pip] Well, Monrolasia might be different.

48:32.958 --> 48:37.125
'Cause there's you,
and then there's that evil queen you made.

48:37.208 --> 48:39.333
Who, Malvina? She's not evil. She's--

48:39.416 --> 48:41.375
Uh, did you see that outfit?

48:41.458 --> 48:45.375
With the big gestures and the crazy eyes!

48:46.666 --> 48:48.166
Oh, no.

48:48.250 --> 48:51.416
So, you better unwish that wish quick
before she, uh--

48:51.500 --> 48:52.958
-[stomach rumbling]
-[groans]

48:53.041 --> 48:54.041
-[Pip burps]
-Pip?

48:54.125 --> 48:56.750
[grunts, groans] I don't feel so--

48:56.833 --> 48:58.833
-[stomach rumbling]
-[burps]

48:58.916 --> 49:00.125
What's wrong?

49:00.208 --> 49:01.708
[grunts, burps]

49:01.791 --> 49:04.750
[groans, screams]

49:04.833 --> 49:05.833
[grunts]

49:05.916 --> 49:08.291
-Oh! Oh.
-[Pip groaning, meowing]

49:08.375 --> 49:09.333
[hisses]

49:09.416 --> 49:10.791
[groans, hisses]

49:10.875 --> 49:11.875
[screams]

49:11.958 --> 49:13.791
-[grunting, groaning]
-[Giselle] Oh, Pip.

49:13.875 --> 49:17.166
Wicked stepmothers don't have
cute chipmunks as friends. They have--

49:17.250 --> 49:20.208
Cats! [meows] And evil ones! [yowls]

49:20.291 --> 49:24.958
Oh, I can't be an evil cat.
They eat chipmunks!

49:25.041 --> 49:27.083
Oh, I'm gonna be sick!

49:27.166 --> 49:28.375
[retching]

49:28.458 --> 49:29.583
[Pip retches]

49:32.916 --> 49:35.875
Surely there's an adventure
out here somewhere.

49:36.583 --> 49:37.791
[villager screams]

49:37.875 --> 49:39.375
A bellow of distress.

49:39.958 --> 49:41.041
[grunts]

49:41.125 --> 49:42.666
Finally! [chuckles]

49:42.750 --> 49:44.333
[villager 1] What are we to do?

49:45.000 --> 49:46.666
[villager 2] I'm not going in there.
You go in.

49:46.750 --> 49:48.708
[villager 3]
Well, I'm certainly not going in there.

49:48.791 --> 49:50.083
Are you a dragon slayer?

49:50.166 --> 49:51.166
I believe I am.

49:52.500 --> 49:53.833
-[villagers scream]
-Ooh.

49:53.916 --> 49:57.125
Never fear. I shall slay the beast.

49:57.208 --> 49:59.750
I wouldn't if I were you.
It is very large.

49:59.833 --> 50:02.083
-Oh.
-And cranky.

50:02.166 --> 50:06.791
Hmm. A very large and cranky dragon is
just what I've been looking for.

50:07.458 --> 50:08.458
Won't be a moment.

50:08.541 --> 50:11.708
-Onward, my sweetness.
-[villagers chattering]

50:14.083 --> 50:15.583
[dragon snarling]

50:15.666 --> 50:18.333
[sword swishing]

50:18.416 --> 50:20.166
-[screams]
-[dragon snarls]

50:21.208 --> 50:22.958
-[grunts]
-[villagers gasp]

50:23.833 --> 50:25.291
Have you done this before?

50:25.375 --> 50:27.000
[chuckles]

50:27.083 --> 50:32.375
Have-- Of course, yes, I have--
I have slain many a dragon.

50:32.458 --> 50:33.916
[dragon snarls]

50:34.000 --> 50:35.708
-[villager 4] Good on you.
-[villager 5] Oh!

50:35.791 --> 50:38.083
[dragon snarling]

50:42.750 --> 50:44.000
[villagers scream]

50:44.083 --> 50:45.250
[screams]

50:47.041 --> 50:48.083
[screams]

50:48.791 --> 50:51.000
-[all gasp]
-[groans] Ow. Oh, oh.

50:51.083 --> 50:54.083
-[dragon laughing]
-Hot. That's hot.

50:55.583 --> 50:56.583
I shall persevere.

50:57.458 --> 50:59.750
I shall conquer the craven beast!

50:59.833 --> 51:01.208
-[stone rumbles]
-I shall--

51:03.416 --> 51:04.416
[villager 6] Hey!

51:04.500 --> 51:08.291
No offense, sir, but you might want
to find another profession.

51:08.375 --> 51:09.666
[villager chuckles]

51:19.250 --> 51:20.541
[gasps]

51:20.625 --> 51:22.125
Uh, what are you doing?

51:22.208 --> 51:25.791
Nancy said if we had any problems,
all we had to do was ask.

51:25.875 --> 51:29.291
Welcome to your magical
wishing wand experience!

51:29.375 --> 51:30.875
-If you should ever have a question…
-Oh.

51:30.958 --> 51:33.625
…just ask, and I shall appear.

51:33.708 --> 51:36.333
-[laughs] Hello!
-Hey, we got no time for this.

51:36.416 --> 51:37.750
[screams] Good kitty. Good kitty.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.208
I'm sorry. My friend's a little anxious

51:40.291 --> 51:43.291
because we need to undo a wish
as soon as possible.

51:43.375 --> 51:44.916
Oh. Didn't like what you got, huh?

51:45.000 --> 51:48.041
Well, I wished for a fairy-tale life,

51:48.125 --> 51:50.625
and it made my town
a place like Andalasia.

51:51.125 --> 51:54.208
And now I'm slowly turning
into a wicked stepmother.

51:54.291 --> 51:56.583
And I'm her soon-to-be-evil cat.

51:56.666 --> 51:58.791
-[groans]
-Oh! [laughs]

51:58.875 --> 52:02.250
Oh, you changed the world.
What? You changed the world!

52:02.333 --> 52:04.750
Do you know how much magic
it takes to make that happen?

52:04.833 --> 52:05.666
-[meows]
-Whoo!

52:05.750 --> 52:08.333
Where do you think
all that magic comes from, hmm?

52:08.416 --> 52:10.291
Andalasia, that's where.

52:10.375 --> 52:12.833
This is world-ending stuff.

52:12.916 --> 52:16.125
This is definitely a wish to be unwished.

52:16.791 --> 52:17.875
Good luck.

52:17.958 --> 52:19.833
-[gasps]
-Uh-oh!

52:19.916 --> 52:22.666
What we need to know
is how to unwish the wish!

52:22.750 --> 52:24.166
Welcome to the magical--

52:24.250 --> 52:26.541
Whoa, it's you. Okay. [laughs]

52:26.625 --> 52:30.166
See, we always build in a certain amount
of time to reverse the wish.

52:30.250 --> 52:31.875
You know, in case you change your mind.

52:31.958 --> 52:34.250
Thank goodness you are not
all villain yet.

52:34.333 --> 52:36.500
-Good.
-[stammers] Watch the tassels, please.

52:36.583 --> 52:39.208
So, how far along are we? Let's see.

52:39.291 --> 52:40.791
Stepmothers. Well, they're wicked.

52:40.875 --> 52:42.875
Wicked good. [gasps] Mmm.

52:42.958 --> 52:45.041
Check on that one. [laughs]

52:45.125 --> 52:46.875
The other three are, well, vain…

52:46.958 --> 52:50.041
I'm not vain.
I just look good in everything. [gasps]

52:50.125 --> 52:51.458
There it is. Okay.

52:51.541 --> 52:54.250
-Uh-oh.
-Cruel and ambitious.

52:54.333 --> 52:58.291
[laughs] Yes, I would say your clock
has not run out yet.

52:58.375 --> 53:00.041
-[Giselle] Good.
-What kinda clock do you mean?

53:00.125 --> 53:01.583
-It could be anything.
-[Giselle sighs]

53:01.666 --> 53:04.458
Have you seen
a flower dropping petals? Huh?

53:04.541 --> 53:05.625
-No?
-Mm-mmm.

53:05.708 --> 53:08.708
How about a clock
counting down to midnight

53:08.791 --> 53:10.875
-with an ominous-sounding chime?
-[gasps]

53:10.958 --> 53:14.208
I mean, it's pretty on the nose,
but it's a classic!

53:14.291 --> 53:17.000
You know, that's not a litter box.
That's where I live.

53:17.083 --> 53:18.541
-[meows]
-Not to worry, though.

53:18.625 --> 53:20.958
-As long as you unwish it before midnight…
-[gasps]

53:21.041 --> 53:22.333
…you'll be fine.

53:22.416 --> 53:23.541
What happens at midnight?

53:23.625 --> 53:27.166
On the last stroke of 12:00,
the spell is set,

53:27.250 --> 53:29.833
and nothing will be as it was before.

53:29.916 --> 53:32.875
It means your wish is permanent.

53:32.958 --> 53:36.916
For all time, 'ime, 'ime, 'ime!

53:37.000 --> 53:39.166
[chuckles] I did that for effect.

53:40.083 --> 53:41.208
Permanent.

53:41.291 --> 53:46.833
To unwish your wish, all you have to do
is use the wand, labeled "wand."

53:46.916 --> 53:49.416
-[Pip] Where is it?
-Yes, yes, yes. It's right--

53:51.208 --> 53:52.208
Uh… [gasps]

53:52.291 --> 53:53.916
-It's gone.
-[bell tolls]

53:54.000 --> 53:55.000
[gasps] Oh, no.

53:55.083 --> 53:57.708
[laughs] Well, good luck with all of this.
You need it.

53:58.791 --> 53:59.875
[Giselle] Oh. [sighs]

53:59.958 --> 54:03.125
-Hurry! It's already--
-Two o'clock.

54:03.208 --> 54:05.916
-[bell tolls]
-That means it's cruelty.

54:06.750 --> 54:08.458
[chuckles] No, no, no, no.

54:08.541 --> 54:10.625
We can't let this happen.
We have to fight it.

54:10.708 --> 54:13.500
I'm not an evil cat. I'm not an evil cat.
I'm not an evil cat.

54:13.583 --> 54:16.041
You stay here.
I have to find a way to stop this.

54:16.125 --> 54:18.625
[groans] And I have to lick this,
for some reason.

54:18.708 --> 54:19.541
Hmm.

54:19.625 --> 54:22.625
Ugh. Aw, yeah, that's real bad. [groans]

54:23.791 --> 54:27.208
It's all going to be okay.
We just need some magic.

54:27.291 --> 54:29.916
As we say in Andalasia,
"Magic fixes everything."

54:30.000 --> 54:31.000
Or breaks it?

54:31.083 --> 54:32.958
But then you find more magic
to undo the magic,

54:33.041 --> 54:34.833
-and then everything's fine again.
-Good day, madam.

54:34.916 --> 54:37.125
[gasps] Oh. Well, at least we look fine.

54:37.208 --> 54:39.666
[gasps] That is not important right now.

54:39.750 --> 54:40.958
Speak for yourself.

54:41.041 --> 54:43.750
But Robert will certainly appreciate it.

54:43.833 --> 54:45.875
If he isn't slain by something. [giggles]

54:45.958 --> 54:49.541
[gasps] Oh, no! She's right.
I mean, I'm right.

54:49.625 --> 54:54.375
He thinks he's a prince. With a sword.
Who knows what he'll find out there?

54:54.958 --> 54:55.958
Or Morgan.

54:57.083 --> 54:59.708
Although, nothing ever happens
to young girls in Andalasia.

54:59.791 --> 55:02.250
They just sing and pick flowers

55:02.333 --> 55:07.208
and sometimes get trapped in a tower
or a dungeon or get kidnapped by trolls.

55:07.291 --> 55:08.916
Or witches. Oh, my!

55:09.458 --> 55:11.500
[chattering]

55:11.583 --> 55:13.000
[villager 1] Oh, that's nice.

55:14.125 --> 55:15.500
[chattering]

55:15.583 --> 55:16.583
[villager 1 chuckling]

55:18.041 --> 55:19.041
-Thank you.
-Oh.

55:19.125 --> 55:21.541
-That's… quite a frock.
-[all laugh]

55:21.625 --> 55:23.541
-[villager 2] What is she wearing?
-[all laugh]

55:23.625 --> 55:26.625
Good morning, Morgan.
You ready for the big festival tonight?

55:26.708 --> 55:29.958
Of course. Uh, my stepmother
even bought me a new dress.

55:30.041 --> 55:31.291
She's never done that before.

55:31.375 --> 55:33.833

perhaps a poultice?

Well, that's an easy one.
It's Andalasian magic,

Aren't they beautiful?

The world is truly a miracle.

1:02:29.333 --> 1:02:33.500
Oh, the most wonderful thing happened.
Tyson asked me to the festival.

1:02:34.000 --> 1:02:35.666
Hmm. Thrilling.

1:02:36.916 --> 1:02:40.166
But I'm afraid you won't be attending
the festival tonight after all.

1:02:40.250 --> 1:02:41.958
You have far too many chores to do.

1:02:43.416 --> 1:02:44.833
But I've done all my chores.

1:02:44.916 --> 1:02:47.833
What about the carpets in the hall?
Awfully dusty.

1:02:48.333 --> 1:02:50.458
And the windows? I can't see a thing.

1:02:50.541 --> 1:02:53.750
And then there's the gardening
and the sewing and the mending.

1:02:53.833 --> 1:02:56.625
And don't forget about the chimneys.
Filthy business.

1:02:58.083 --> 1:03:01.541
Yes, perhaps there are a few
that I've missed.

1:03:01.625 --> 1:03:05.000
-Oh, but surely they can wait--
-Are you speaking back to me?

1:03:05.083 --> 1:03:07.958
No, of course not.
I would never do such a thing.

1:03:08.041 --> 1:03:10.750
Perhaps you need
to remember your place here.

1:03:10.833 --> 1:03:14.500
Until you do, you are not to leave
this room, except for chores.

1:03:14.583 --> 1:03:16.875
And then only when I say.

1:03:16.958 --> 1:03:19.583
But I promised Tyson
that I would be there.

1:03:19.666 --> 1:03:21.166
Oh, come now, Morgan.

1:03:21.250 --> 1:03:25.083
A boy like Tyson has plenty of options
and, frankly, better ones.

1:03:25.166 --> 1:03:26.875
But not to worry.

1:03:27.541 --> 1:03:31.541
You can enjoy your evening
from up here in your little perch.

1:03:32.083 --> 1:03:34.416

-Morgan, you have to listen to me.

1:07:53.375 --> 1:07:55.166
[gasps] Oh, yes, yes.

1:07:55.250 --> 1:07:57.833
Perfect little Morgan,
not so perfect now, is she?

1:07:57.916 --> 1:07:59.041
[gasps]

1:07:59.125 --> 1:08:00.875
Don't you dare!

1:08:02.083 --> 1:08:04.625
Oh, I'll dare all I like.

1:08:04.708 --> 1:08:07.208
Stop it! You're-- You're scaring me.

1:08:07.291 --> 1:08:08.291
I know.

1:08:08.375 --> 1:08:10.458
[pants] I wish I could do it myself,

1:08:10.541 --> 1:08:14.041
but who knows what would happen
if I went over there like this? [gasps]

1:08:14.958 --> 1:08:15.958
You have to go.

1:08:16.541 --> 1:08:17.375
[gasps]

1:08:17.458 --> 1:08:19.250
[chuckles] Yes!

1:08:19.750 --> 1:08:21.583
Get help before it's too late.

1:08:21.666 --> 1:08:23.166
[panting]

1:08:23.250 --> 1:08:26.916
-And you have to do it before midnight.
-Do what? [pants]

1:08:27.625 --> 1:08:28.958
Save us.

1:08:32.333 --> 1:08:33.500
[screams]

1:08:34.708 --> 1:08:35.708
Oh. [gasps]

1:08:38.583 --> 1:08:40.416
Wretched girl! [chuckles]

1:08:40.500 --> 1:08:42.208

-You three!
-[all gasp]

1:08:46.833 --> 1:08:48.791
[Giselle]
You look like you're good with children.

1:08:48.875 --> 1:08:52.583
My precious darling needs tending to.
See to it.

1:08:52.666 --> 1:08:54.666
[all whimpering]

1:08:56.583 --> 1:09:00.958
Mmm.
Oh, I feel superior to all living things.

1:09:01.041 --> 1:09:03.250
I don't know why we were fighting this.

1:09:03.333 --> 1:09:04.333
[Giselle] Indeed!

1:09:04.416 --> 1:09:09.583
Who knew that being a villain
could feel so… liberating?

1:09:10.375 --> 1:09:12.708
-Now, I just need to find that wand.
-[grunts, hisses]

1:09:12.791 --> 1:09:13.833

1:09:13.916 --> 1:09:14.916
[chuckles]

1:09:21.375 --> 1:09:23.875
What have we here?

1:09:36.208 --> 1:09:39.458
You know, stepmothers are many things.

1:09:39.541 --> 1:09:42.083
But one of the things we are not
is powerful.

1:09:42.166 --> 1:09:45.333
That's why we have to go through
all of these ridiculous manipulations.

1:09:45.416 --> 1:09:47.291
We have no power of our own.

1:09:48.250 --> 1:09:52.125
Now that Morgan's gone,
I'm not a stepmother anymore.

1:09:52.208 --> 1:09:53.041
[Pip yawns]

1:09:53.125 --> 1:09:56.208
So I think it's time
I took on a new role in this town.

1:09:57.625 --> 1:09:59.458
I'd like to be queen!

1:10:00.291 --> 1:10:01.916
Yeah, but there's already a queen,

1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.791
and I feel like
she is really attached to the job.

1:10:04.875 --> 1:10:07.541
[chuckles]
That should be easy enough to fix.

1:10:07.625 --> 1:10:13.250
A villain like Malvina can't resist
a chance to show the world how bad she is.

1:10:13.333 --> 1:10:15.291
Mmm. So, where are we going?

1:10:15.375 --> 1:10:16.625
I say we give it to her.

1:10:17.958 --> 1:10:21.375
And then I have a little job for you,
my pet.

1:10:21.458 --> 1:10:25.458
Ooh. Do I get to be evil now?

1:10:25.541 --> 1:10:26.708
-Oh, yes.
-[purring]

1:10:34.041 --> 1:10:35.125
Oh.

1:10:35.208 --> 1:10:36.583
Uh-uh. Oh.

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:40.916
[bell tinkles]

1:10:43.375 --> 1:10:44.375
[Giselle chuckles]

1:10:44.458 --> 1:10:47.375
-Hmm?
-[gasps] Mirror, mirror in her hand.

1:10:47.458 --> 1:10:50.208
Who is the most blatantly insecure woman,

1:10:50.291 --> 1:10:53.250
whose constant need
to ask her own reflection for validation

1:10:53.333 --> 1:10:56.458
suggests that what she really needs to do
is to love herself,

1:10:57.458 --> 1:10:58.833
in all the land?

1:10:58.916 --> 1:10:59.916
[chuckles]

1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:03.833
Giselle, a pleasure as always.

1:11:04.458 --> 1:11:07.333
Yes, I imagine it is. [gasps]

1:11:07.416 --> 1:11:12.041
Well, I was hoping that I'd run into you,
and look at this. It seems I have.

1:11:12.125 --> 1:11:13.791
[chuckles]

1:11:13.875 --> 1:11:16.291
So, what can I do for you then?

1:11:17.041 --> 1:11:19.250
I thought it only fair
to give you a chance

1:11:19.333 --> 1:11:24.166
to hand Monrolasia over to me peacefully
before any unpleasantness begins.

1:11:24.666 --> 1:11:25.750
-[gasps]
-Mmm?

1:11:25.833 --> 1:11:28.875
[laughs]

1:11:28.958 --> 1:11:31.000
And why would I do that?

1:11:31.083 --> 1:11:34.208
Because this town is mine.

1:11:35.125 --> 1:11:36.916
I think we both know that, don't we?

1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.458
Oh… [gasps]

1:11:40.041 --> 1:11:41.625
-[grunts]
-Oh.

1:11:42.916 --> 1:11:47.958
Sadly, I'm going to have to decline
your generous offer.

1:11:48.041 --> 1:11:51.791
Having had a chat
with your little scroll friend,

1:11:51.875 --> 1:11:55.666
it's clear that Monrolasia is everything
it was meant to be,

1:11:56.166 --> 1:11:59.125
however that might have occurred.

1:12:01.458 --> 1:12:02.583
Hmm.

1:12:02.666 --> 1:12:04.958
Well, I tried.

1:12:05.041 --> 1:12:08.375
But if you won't accept the offer,

1:12:09.208 --> 1:12:11.791
you know there's only one thing
that can happen.

1:12:11.875 --> 1:12:13.000
[Malvina] Indeed.

1:12:14.208 --> 1:12:15.208
Dance-off!

1:12:15.291 --> 1:12:16.958
You see what I gotta put up with?

1:12:17.833 --> 1:12:19.291
One of us has to die.

1:12:19.958 --> 1:12:23.041
Mmm. Say, midnight?

1:12:23.125 --> 1:12:24.333
Sounds about right.

1:12:24.833 --> 1:12:27.708
Again,
I'm so sorry to ruin your little party

1:12:27.791 --> 1:12:30.583
with all of this messy
"destroying you" business.

1:12:30.666 --> 1:12:32.625
Oh, Giselle.

I'm not sure.

1:16:52.833 --> 1:16:54.875
Something weird happened.

1:16:54.958 --> 1:16:58.666
Did it, by any chance,
include a giant hole in your sky?

1:16:58.750 --> 1:17:01.125
[Morgan] A what? What the heck is that?

1:17:01.625 --> 1:17:04.541
Last night,
that mysterious hole appeared in the sky

1:17:04.625 --> 1:17:08.750
and started pulling all of our magic
into some other place.

1:17:08.833 --> 1:17:09.958
[troll] Oh.

1:17:10.041 --> 1:17:13.000
Okay, Morgan, tell us what happened.

1:17:13.083 --> 1:17:18.000
Well, Giselle and I had
a pretty bad fight. And then, uh…

1:17:18.083 --> 1:17:19.208
[Nancy] And then what?

1:17:19.291 --> 1:17:21.833
-[gasps]
-[Morgan] I'm not sure, exactly.

1:17:21.916 --> 1:17:25.875
But the last thing I remember is
Giselle acting really, really cruel.

1:17:25.958 --> 1:17:29.833
And then she said something about
making a wish and that I had to fix it.

1:17:29.916 --> 1:17:33.583
Oh, Edward. The wishing wand.
She must have used it.

1:17:33.666 --> 1:17:37.125
But what could she have possibly
wished for that would have done all this?

1:17:37.208 --> 1:17:42.333
Well, whatever it was, it turned our whole
town into some kind of fairy-tale place.

1:17:42.416 --> 1:17:44.000
Just like Andalasia.

1:17:44.708 --> 1:17:47.458
Morgan, a wish so big
that it changes a world

1:17:47.541 --> 1:17:49.375
wouldn't need a little of our magic.

1:17:49.875 --> 1:17:53.250
Why, it would-- It would need all of it,
every last bit.

1:17:53.333 --> 1:17:56.541
Wait.
But everything here is made of magic.

1:17:56.625 --> 1:18:00.125
If it's all gone,
then what happens to Andalasia?

1:18:00.208 --> 1:18:01.833
If we can't reverse this,

1:18:01.916 --> 1:18:04.666

will be gone forever.

-No.

1:18:10.375 --> 1:18:11.875
There must be something we can do.

1:18:11.958 --> 1:18:17.250
Giselle just needs to remember who she is,
and then she can fix all of this.

1:18:17.333 --> 1:18:18.416
I know she can.

1:18:18.500 --> 1:18:20.916

-Unless you wanna get thrown off the roof.

1:18:50.916 --> 1:18:51.916
Hmm.

1:18:52.625 --> 1:18:53.875
[babbles]

1:18:54.416 --> 1:18:56.791
[sighs] Ah!

1:18:56.875 --> 1:19:00.333
Seems like the babysitters
have had quite the day.

1:19:00.416 --> 1:19:03.666
So have I, dear.

1:19:05.958 --> 1:19:06.958
Hmm.

1:19:07.750 --> 1:19:08.750
Hmm.

1:19:12.541 --> 1:19:16.000
We're really going to need
something more regal than this.

1:19:16.500 --> 1:19:17.666
And minions.

1:19:17.750 --> 1:19:20.791
We'll definitely need minions
if we want anything done right.

1:19:21.875 --> 1:19:23.875
Where did you say Morgan was again?

1:19:23.958 --> 1:19:25.333
Oh. [chuckles]

1:19:25.416 --> 1:19:26.500
Who knows?

1:19:26.583 --> 1:19:28.916
-Hmm.
-Probably singing to a mouse or something.

1:19:29.708 --> 1:19:31.833
But who cares? Tonight's about me.

1:19:34.750 --> 1:19:35.750
Stop the carriage.

1:19:35.833 --> 1:19:36.833
Whoa!

1:19:36.916 --> 1:19:37.791
[Giselle] Robert.

1:19:38.458 --> 1:19:40.500
Morgan wouldn't just disappear like this.

1:19:41.000 --> 1:19:42.750
Unless something's happened.

1:19:43.375 --> 1:19:45.791
Something's wrong.
I'm going to go find her.

1:19:45.875 --> 1:19:48.000
Oh, well, another fruitless quest,

1:19:48.083 --> 1:19:50.458
-but… [chuckles] …good luck with that.
-[grunts]

1:19:54.000 --> 1:19:55.000

1:20:05.875 --> 1:20:10.375
Okay, I knew it was a tree house,
but that's a "tree house."

1:20:10.458 --> 1:20:12.500
-We do whimsy really well.
-Huh.

1:20:12.583 --> 1:20:14.125
I think the tree is over here.

1:20:14.916 --> 1:20:16.041
[bird squawks]

1:20:19.875 --> 1:20:21.250
That's it. That's the tree!

1:20:27.666 --> 1:20:28.666
[sighs]

1:20:32.500 --> 1:20:33.666
Oh, no.

1:20:40.541 --> 1:20:41.583
It's dead.

1:20:43.208 --> 1:20:46.416
Never fear. We will come up with something
very smart at the very last minute

1:20:46.500 --> 1:20:47.958
that solves all our problems.

1:20:48.041 --> 1:20:49.083
Edward.

1:20:49.750 --> 1:20:51.333
What? That's how it works here.

1:20:51.416 --> 1:20:53.333
There has to be something we can do.

1:20:54.083 --> 1:20:58.791
You know, for a little girl with no mom,

1:20:58.875 --> 1:21:01.666
seeing a princess hanging from a billboard
was magic.

1:21:01.750 --> 1:21:04.583
I-I knew it was real.
I didn't even have to think about it.

1:21:04.666 --> 1:21:06.583
Things were so much easier back then.

1:21:06.666 --> 1:21:08.625
-[Giselle's voice] I'll never forget you.
-Whoa.

1:21:08.708 --> 1:21:09.791
What was that?

1:21:09.875 --> 1:21:11.791
You brought the flower back to life.

1:21:11.875 --> 1:21:12.916
I did?

1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:15.125
But how? I'm not magic.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:16.708
No, but these memories are.

1:21:17.208 --> 1:21:19.041
And they live inside you as well.

1:21:19.125 --> 1:21:20.708
Which means their magic does too.

1:21:20.791 --> 1:21:22.500
Morgan, you're the key.

1:21:22.583 --> 1:21:25.166
That's what Giselle meant
by telling you to save us.

1:21:25.250 --> 1:21:28.166
So, maybe if I can bring
some of this tree back,

1:21:28.250 --> 1:21:31.875
the magic in it will get her to remember
that who she really is, is good.

1:21:32.375 --> 1:21:33.583
Then she'll fix this.

1:21:34.458 --> 1:21:36.166
I think we're running out of time.

1:21:37.208 --> 1:21:38.750
But what if it doesn't work?

1:21:38.833 --> 1:21:40.458
[Nancy] Morgan, it will.

1:21:40.541 --> 1:21:43.750
You just have to remember
all the good in these moments

1:21:43.833 --> 1:21:45.375
because you're a part of them.

1:21:45.916 --> 1:21:48.083

1:31:59.375 --> 1:32:00.958
Speaking of toads.

1:32:01.041 --> 1:32:02.750

-Nancy!
-Robert!

1:32:22.250 --> 1:32:23.458
Have you seen Morgan?

1:32:23.541 --> 1:32:26.208
-Yes. She's here. She's fine.
-Oh, thank goodness.

1:32:26.291 --> 1:32:28.041
My God, people are going crazy.

1:32:28.125 --> 1:32:30.875
I know. I know. Listen, it's Giselle.
She's under a curse.

1:32:30.958 --> 1:32:33.375
We have to save her so she can stop this.

1:32:33.458 --> 1:32:34.333
A curse?

1:32:35.375 --> 1:32:36.375
Let's go!

[Morgan] Dad!

1:32:45.625 --> 1:32:46.625
Dad!

1:32:46.708 --> 1:32:48.166
How have you fared? Oh!

1:32:48.250 --> 1:32:50.166
I have searched both hither and yon.

1:32:50.250 --> 1:32:51.833
We need to get inside. Let's go.

1:32:51.916 --> 1:32:53.541
When did my daughter become so brave?

1:32:54.333 --> 1:32:55.416
Now we save Giselle.

1:32:55.500 --> 1:32:56.958
Time to be heroes.

Giselle, no!

1:33:53.166 --> 1:33:54.791
[Giselle's voice]
This is a very nice place.

1:33:54.875 --> 1:33:56.958
-[Robert's voice] Yeah.
-[Giselle's voice] This is a date.

1:33:57.041 --> 1:33:59.708
-She's very kind and very sweet.
-[Robert's voice] Yeah.

1:34:00.416 --> 1:34:03.041

-[Giselle's voice] I'm right here, Morgan.

1:34:04.333 --> 1:34:05.708
[Morgan's voice] Hey, wait for me!

1:34:07.041 --> 1:34:09.541
Mom, where are you going?

1:34:09.625 --> 1:34:11.500
[Giselle's voice] I'm not going anywhere.

1:34:13.750 --> 1:34:15.875
[Robert's voice]
You'll always be a princess to me.

1:34:18.416 --> 1:34:20.041

Higher! Higher, Mom!

1:34:20.875 --> 1:34:22.041

Uh-oh.
What the heck is going on around here?

1:34:30.625 --> 1:34:31.750
Uh, Giselle!

1:34:40.625 --> 1:34:41.625
[Giselle] Oh.

1:34:44.416 --> 1:34:45.416
[gasps]

1:34:55.708 --> 1:34:56.708
Robert.

1:34:57.875 --> 1:34:58.708

1:34:58.791 --> 1:34:59.625

1:35:00.833 --> 1:35:01.916
My sweet Giselle.

1:35:03.208 --> 1:35:04.583
You've come back to me.

1:35:05.666 --> 1:35:09.083
I'm so sorry. I don't want minions.

1:35:10.625 --> 1:35:12.125
[rumbling]

1:35:12.208 --> 1:35:13.541
[gasps]

1:35:13.625 --> 1:35:15.500
Nancy, where's Edward?

1:35:15.583 --> 1:35:17.666
He stayed behind to protect Andalasia.

1:35:17.750 --> 1:35:18.750
[Giselle] Oh, no.

1:35:18.833 --> 1:35:20.666
-Please, we have to hurry.
-[gasps]

1:35:22.833 --> 1:35:24.208
The magic is disappearing.

1:35:25.333 --> 1:35:28.500
We have to stop this
or everything Andalasian will die.

1:35:30.875 --> 1:35:32.416
And that means that you…

1:35:34.000 --> 1:35:35.000
will?

1:35:35.083 --> 1:35:36.083
No.

1:35:37.500 --> 1:35:38.625
No, I--

1:35:39.458 --> 1:35:40.541
I can fix this.

1:35:41.125 --> 1:35:42.375
[Malvina] Stop!

1:35:43.250 --> 1:35:45.166
I wouldn't if I were you.

1:35:47.291 --> 1:35:48.541
-[Malvina laughs]
-[Robert] Morgan.

1:35:48.625 --> 1:35:50.000
Morgan! [pants]

1:35:50.083 --> 1:35:52.875
-Mother, what are you doing?
-Oh, relax, darling.

1:35:52.958 --> 1:35:55.041
It's just a little sleeping potion.

1:35:55.125 --> 1:35:59.500
It was actually meant for Giselle,
but this'll do.

1:35:59.583 --> 1:36:01.125
Malvina, you have to undo it.

1:36:01.208 --> 1:36:02.333
[Malvina] Oh, and I shall.

1:36:02.416 --> 1:36:06.250
Your helpful scroll explained
at the last stroke of midnight,

1:36:06.333 --> 1:36:07.500
your wish is permanent.

1:36:07.583 --> 1:36:09.541
And I like this world.

1:36:09.625 --> 1:36:12.000
So you're going to drop that wand
and let the clock strike,

1:36:12.083 --> 1:36:14.291
and then, she'll be free.

1:36:14.375 --> 1:36:18.625
But if I do that, Andalasia dies.

1:36:19.541 --> 1:36:22.208
And if you don't do it, she dies.

1:36:23.375 --> 1:36:25.916
-No.
-Cease, evil witch.

1:36:26.000 --> 1:36:28.916
Oh, Robert. Don't you think
you're being a little harsh?

1:36:29.000 --> 1:36:30.208
Malvina, please.

1:36:31.333 --> 1:36:32.458
This isn't you.

1:36:32.541 --> 1:36:33.500
It is now.

1:36:33.583 --> 1:36:38.041
Just as you wished it.

1:36:38.125 --> 1:36:39.875
[gasps] No!

1:36:42.333 --> 1:36:43.708

1:37:13.083 --> 1:37:14.625
Giselle. Giselle.

1:37:14.708 --> 1:37:17.250
-[Morgan] What's happening?
-[groans, pants]

1:37:17.333 --> 1:37:19.375

-Huh.

1:38:10.458 --> 1:38:11.833
[Tyson] I'm coming with you.

1:38:56.125 --> 1:38:57.500
I'm so sorry.

1:38:57.583 --> 1:38:58.833
This is all my fault.

1:38:58.916 --> 1:39:02.000
No, no, no. There has to be
something else that we can do.

1:39:02.083 --> 1:39:03.708
-I just wish…
-No.

1:39:06.916 --> 1:39:09.250
That piece of wand. Grab it. [pants]

1:39:29.625 --> 1:39:30.833
Listen to me.

You have to make a new wish, Morgan.

1:39:34.791 --> 1:39:36.458
My magic is almost gone.

1:39:37.250 --> 1:39:40.916
Oh, according to your droll little scroll,

1:39:41.000 --> 1:39:45.416
no one but a true Andalasian
can use that broken piece of kindling.

1:39:45.500 --> 1:39:47.500
But go for it.

1:39:48.291 --> 1:39:53.333
She's right. [stammers] I can't.
I'm not a true daughter of Andalasia.

1:39:53.416 --> 1:39:56.250
You are a true daughter of Andalasia.

1:43:42.166 --> 1:43:44.208
-and defeated an evil queen.
-[Giselle laughs]

1:43:44.958 --> 1:43:47.250
-Good luck with that. [kisses]
-[Sofia giggles]

1:43:48.333 --> 1:43:50.333
[chattering]

1:43:55.833 --> 1:43:58.958
I had a horrible dream about toads.

1:43:59.625 --> 1:44:00.833
-Me too.
-[bell tinkling]

1:44:03.375 --> 1:44:04.375
Good morning, Edgar.

1:44:04.958 --> 1:44:06.583
Giselle, the usual?

1:44:07.083 --> 1:44:08.833
Oh, yes, please. Thank you.

1:44:14.666 --> 1:44:17.708
Good morning. I'm sorry to interrupt.

1:44:18.291 --> 1:44:19.625
I just thought I'd say hi.

1:44:20.125 --> 1:44:25.875
And I really wanted to apologize
for a lot of things. [chuckles]

1:44:27.250 --> 1:44:29.875
I just really wanted Morgan
to be happy here,

1:44:29.958 --> 1:44:32.333
and I guess I got a little carried away.
[chuckles]

1:44:36.291 --> 1:44:38.458
Okay. Enjoy your coffees.

1:44:41.583 --> 1:44:42.583
You know…

1:44:47.958 --> 1:44:48.958
Um,

1:44:50.125 --> 1:44:55.625
I have the tendency
to get carried away myself sometimes.

1:44:56.250 --> 1:44:57.625
[chuckles] No.

1:44:57.708 --> 1:45:04.083
It turns out we do have room on one
of our committees, if you'd be interested.

1:45:04.166 --> 1:45:05.458
Mmm. Hmm?

1:45:06.291 --> 1:45:09.625
I think our town could use
someone like you.

1:45:11.291 --> 1:45:13.625
I'd love that. [chuckles]

1:45:14.583 --> 1:45:16.041
-Oh!
-Oh, we're hugging.

1:45:16.125 --> 1:45:17.958
-[Giselle chuckles] Okay.
-[Malvina chuckles]

1:45:18.041 --> 1:45:20.291
-Not your chair.
-Oh, right. Nope. Okay.

1:45:20.375 --> 1:45:21.625
Mm-hmm. Yep.

1:45:22.541 --> 1:45:23.625
[Giselle chuckles]

1:45:24.916 --> 1:45:29.791
[Pip] And so, a new story for Giselle
and her family began in Monroeville.

1:45:30.500 --> 1:45:32.000
Without the magic this time.

1:45:32.833 --> 1:45:36.916
Robert opened a small practice in town,
and never rode the train again.

1:45:37.000 --> 1:45:39.083
Sofia sprouted up.

1:45:39.166 --> 1:45:40.833
-And Morgan…
-[Tyson] Hey, Morgan!

1:45:42.625 --> 1:45:43.958
[babbles]

1:45:46.166 --> 1:45:48.708
-Um, I'll be back in a sec.
-Mm-hmm.

1:45:48.791 --> 1:45:51.250
[Pip] Well, she was still a teenager.

1:45:51.333 --> 1:45:52.958
-Stop looking at me. It's creepy.
-No, I'm just--

1:45:53.041 --> 1:45:54.458
-Not looking!
-Gonna pour some--

1:45:54.541 --> 1:45:56.875
-[Nancy] I am so sorry I'm late.
-[chuckles] Oh!

1:45:56.958 --> 1:45:59.083
-There was a gaggle of hobgoblins…
-That's okay.

1:45:59.166 --> 1:46:00.291
…in the woods today.

1:46:00.375 --> 1:46:03.041
-They just wouldn't give up.
-[all laugh]

1:46:03.125 --> 1:46:05.291
It took the whole village
to drive 'em out.

1:46:05.375 --> 1:46:07.583
-[clears throat]
-Where is Edward? Did he stay behind?

1:46:07.666 --> 1:46:10.208
Oh, no, no, no. He's here.
He's engaged in battle.

1:46:10.291 --> 1:46:12.541
-Of course.
-Back, you wild beasts! Back!

1:46:12.625 --> 1:46:13.625
[groans]

1:46:13.708 --> 1:46:14.708
You're dead!

1:46:14.791 --> 1:46:16.416
No, I'm not. You merely grazed me.

1:46:16.500 --> 1:46:17.875
-You grazed me!
-[laughing]

1:46:17.958 --> 1:46:19.250
I'm not dead.

1:46:19.333 --> 1:46:20.791
Look, I have barely a limp!

1:46:20.875 --> 1:46:22.666
-[chuckling]
-[Edward groans, sighs]

1:46:23.458 --> 1:46:24.791
-[Nancy laughs]
-[giggles]

1:46:24.875 --> 1:46:27.125
[chuckles]
Your tiny peasants are quite fierce.

1:46:28.958 --> 1:46:30.875
-As are you, Robert…
-Oh, no.

1:46:30.958 --> 1:46:35.583
…who so grandly helped save the day
with my sword.

1:46:35.666 --> 1:46:39.416
Well, may your adventures
with my sword continue, my good man.

1:46:39.500 --> 1:46:43.708
-Actually, Edward. I've hung up the sword.
-Ah.

1:46:43.791 --> 1:46:46.166
I'm happy to say
I don't really need it here.

1:46:46.250 --> 1:46:47.625
-Really? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

1:46:47.708 --> 1:46:49.083
-Yeah.
-What a tragedy.

1:46:49.166 --> 1:46:50.291
Can I have it back?

1:46:50.375 --> 1:46:51.541
-Yes. Of course you can.
-[laughs]

1:46:51.625 --> 1:46:53.500
-Okay. Great.
-[Giselle] Shall we feast?

1:46:53.583 --> 1:46:55.041
-[Nancy] Absolutely.
-What can I get you?

1:46:55.125 --> 1:46:57.833
-But first, we have a very special gift.
-[Edward sighs]

1:46:57.916 --> 1:47:01.208
Whatever dish you wish
will appear on this plate.

1:47:01.291 --> 1:47:02.541
-Hmm?
-Oh. Oh.

1:47:02.625 --> 1:47:04.250
That's all that it does. That's--

1:47:04.333 --> 1:47:06.166
-Right? That's-- We're fairly certain.
-Yeah.

1:47:06.833 --> 1:47:08.541
-Maybe you should make the wish.
-Yes.

1:47:08.625 --> 1:47:10.666
-All right. [chuckles, groans]
-[Nancy] Oh!

1:47:10.750 --> 1:47:12.708
[grunts] Excuse me.
I must defend my honor.

1:47:12.791 --> 1:47:14.458
-I declare a do-over!
-I'll go deal with that.

1:47:14.541 --> 1:47:16.375
-Here. Let me help you.
-Yes, of course.

1:47:16.458 --> 1:47:17.625
I'm coming too!

1:47:17.708 --> 1:47:18.708
[Edward grunts]

1:47:19.291 --> 1:47:21.166
-[chuckles]
-[child grunts] Got you!

1:47:24.166 --> 1:47:25.166
[babbles]

1:47:27.083 --> 1:47:28.083
[chuckles]

1:47:33.208 --> 1:47:34.583
What was that for?

1:47:34.666 --> 1:47:36.125
-I just love you.
-Mmm.

1:47:36.208 --> 1:47:38.583
