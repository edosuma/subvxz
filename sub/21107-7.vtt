01:35.228 --> 01:38.330
Hi, guys.
Quasi, just wondering.

01:38.332 --> 01:41.133
Uh, you got any salt
around here?

01:41.135 --> 01:41.667
Gah!

01:41.669 --> 01:45.704
It's, uh, it's not for me.
It's for, uh, Aunt Lydia.

So, you and your
"Aunt Lydia..."

01:50.711 --> 01:52.678

01:52.680 --> 01:56.682

01:56.684 --> 01:59.852

02:00.921 --> 02:03.155

If Aunt Lydia finds out
Quasimodo quit

02:34.155 --> 02:36.455
and she doesn't get
her favorite breakfast
tomorrow,

02:36.457 --> 02:39.024
not only will I lose my
employee-of-the-month title,

02:39.026 --> 02:41.293

Come on.
You don't really care about
being employee of the month.

02:55.276 --> 02:57.843
It is the most important

02:57.845 --> 03:00.112
Nobody ever wins
except Gavin,

03:00.114 --> 03:06.018
and now, me.
My Dad will be so proud
of his little Mavy Wavy,

03:06.020 --> 03:09.087
and I'll be able to milk it
for months.

03:09.089 --> 03:10.222
That's so...sweet.

03:10.224 --> 03:13.025
But if Aunt Lydia finds out
what I've done,
she'll strip me

03:13.027 --> 03:16.495
of the award
and lord it over me for
the next thousand years.

03:16.497 --> 03:19.932
No, thanks.
I've got to get
Quasimodo back.

03:19.934 --> 03:21.733
Check it out,
my fiendish friends.

A fresh batch of tasty

There's no time for eating,
Pedro.

03:28.709 --> 03:33.045

03:33.047 --> 03:34.479
This is
really good.

03:34.481 --> 03:37.416
Well, thank you.
The secret is...

03:37.418 --> 03:38.283
That you can cook.

03:38.285 --> 03:40.252
This will solve
all of my problems.

03:40.254 --> 03:42.721
You can replace Quasimodo,
make the ghoul-ash,

never find out.

04:07.548 --> 04:09.648

I got Quasimodo to make you

04:13.387 --> 04:14.386
a special version.

04:14.388 --> 04:19.190
It looks different because
he's using imported
fungus breath.

04:19.192 --> 04:20.524
Imported?

04:20.527 --> 04:24.129
Hmm.

Hmm. The nose hairs
are well prepared.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.778
It's perfect!
Maybe even better than usual.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.282
You can really taste
that imported fungus breath.

04:43.284 --> 04:45.083
Yes!
It worked.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.719
I mean, uh, enjoy.

04:48.421 --> 04:49.121
Whew.

04:49.123 --> 04:51.790
Pedro, you are
the ghoul-ash ghoul.

04:51.792 --> 04:54.092
Well, I did have
a little help.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.427
I was just in it for the hat,

04:55.429 --> 04:57.195
but it was an honor
to be a part of the team.

04:57.197 --> 05:00.399
I spent most of the time
karate-chopping baguettes.

05:00.401 --> 05:02.000
Hii-ya!
Whoa.

05:02.002 --> 05:03.335
Yeah, sure,

05:03.337 --> 05:06.471
but I was actually
talking about Jerome.

05:06.473 --> 05:07.639
OTHERS:
Jerome?

05:07.641 --> 05:10.542
Jerome is the real reason
I can cook.

05:10.544 --> 05:12.177
He tells me what to do.

05:12.179 --> 05:15.213
Well, thanks to you guys
and Jerome,

05:15.215 --> 05:18.283

loves the ghoul-ash.

anyhow?

05:31.899 --> 05:34.099

05:34.101 --> 05:35.867
Pedro refuses to make it.

05:35.869 --> 05:39.371

He's an artiste,

05:39.373 --> 05:41.039
and like all great artistes,

05:41.041 --> 05:44.710
he never makes
the same dish twice.

05:44.712 --> 05:47.012
But you have to.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.114
Start cooking already!

Excuse me, Mavis.

05:53.454 --> 05:54.820

05:54.822 --> 05:59.024

is going to be yelling,
it's me.

You call that
a karate chop?

06:01.295 --> 06:03.628
This is
a karate chop!

06:03.630 --> 06:06.531

your eyes.

And now,
I'm not going
to make anything.

06:13.440 --> 06:15.440
Not only because
I'm an artiste,

06:15.442 --> 06:18.577

from all that yelling.

it'll probably work
again, right?
