peckers until you get mouth cancer.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.753
[ Laughing ]
Mouth cancer.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.338
- Can I come to the table?
- [ Adriano ] No!

08:25.422 --> 08:28.299
[ Whispers ] For some reason,
homophobia— I's awesome to these guys.

08:28.383 --> 08:30.552
I"m sewing myself in.
I'm doing this for us. Okay?

08:30.635 --> 08:32.220
What the hell
is she talking about?

08:32.303 --> 08:34.889
She's going to strike when the moment"s
right. She's doing it for us, dude.

08:34.972 --> 08:36.265
Really?
Yeah.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.727
Did you thank her? Of course
I thanked her. Absolutely.

08:38.852 --> 08:40.520
Oh, what's up, boys?
Hey.

08:40.602 --> 08:42.938
- All right, | got your name tags.
- Oh.

08:43.023 --> 08:45.150
- Hey, did you get on Mac about his?
- Yeah, he's got—

08:45.275 --> 08:47.485
It's not that— It's not
funny. That's so funny.

08:47.569 --> 08:51.281
- Adriano came over and blasted him about it.
- Oh, he did? Oh, good.

08:51.364 --> 08:53.533
So Adriano's probably gonna
tell everybody about it.

08:53.616 --> 08:55.201
That's going to get around
the whole reunion.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.329
Get going round and round. Probably
not. Probably getting old already.

08:58.413 --> 09:00.248
So, guys, this is where
we part ways, all right?

09:00.331 --> 09:02.083
So do not talk to me
for the rest of the night,

09:02.167 --> 09:04.669
and I won't be talking to you,
because you lower my stock.

09:04.753 --> 09:07.380
You guys get it. I'm going to go post
up one of these tables around here.

09:07.464 --> 09:10.675
Let my loyal subjects come
and kiss my ring. [ Laughs ]

09:10.759 --> 09:13.303
Listen, don't laugh
when people make fun of me.

Look. I got myself a name
tag. I"m Nicki Potnick. Mmm.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.295
Remember the time you crashed
my car into the tree?

09:47.420 --> 09:49.589
You went crazy and the tire
went— We had such a good time.

09:49.672 --> 09:51.716
Okay, Frank, first off,
Nicki Potnick is a girl, okay?

09:51.800 --> 09:53.510
And secondly,
she's not 65 years old.

09:53.593 --> 09:56.679
| don't want to talk to you. | don't want
to be around you. Go find Mac and Charlie.

Ooh.
Oh, goddamn.

10:08.441 --> 10:10.193
You're late on your alimony.

10:10.276 --> 10:12.237
Can we not talk about
alimony payments right now?

10:12.362 --> 10:14.989
We're at our reunion. Didn't think
you'd run into your ex-wife, huh?

10:15.073 --> 10:17.367
No, I didn't think about it, Maureen,
because I don't think about you.

Really?
No.

Ho! Ho!

10:23.039 --> 10:25.041
It wafted over here.
The dead tooth—

10:25.125 --> 10:26.918
I's burning my nose. It stinks.

10:27.043 --> 10:29.546
What is that supposed to be? That's
where your monthly payments are going.

10:29.629 --> 10:31.256
That's a diamond tooth, Dennis.

10:31.381 --> 10:34.092
A dead tooth, Maureen.
With a diamond in it.

10:34.175 --> 10:36.636
Put a diamond on anything that's
dead, and it's still dead, Maureen.

10:36.719 --> 10:38.304
It's rotting.
Get it out of your face.

10:38.388 --> 10:40.056
Look, I don't want to talk
about these things.

who cares though, right?

11:07.125 --> 11:10.086
'Cause it's high school.
Who cares?

welcomed back into the cloth.
