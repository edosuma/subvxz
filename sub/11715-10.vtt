Yo, yo, yo.

00:06.924 --> 00:07.967
Sir, I just put your sop
in your office,
it's very hot, so...

00:08.008 --> 00:12.011
(RUSSELL SCREAMS)

00:12.053 --> 00:14.014
...don't eat it yet. (S)

00:14.055 --> 00:14.974
(GROANS)

00:16.809 --> 00:18.018
Ah, it's too hot again.

00:20.354 --> 00:22.648
Sir, I've told you,
if you were a bit
more patient

00:22.690 --> 00:24.733
you wouldn't always
burn your tongue.

00:24.775 --> 00:25.985
I know,
but it looks so good
I want it right now.

00:26.025 --> 00:26.819
Sir, stop, stop.

00:27.277 --> 00:28.111
I can't!

00:29.780 --> 00:31.323
It's too good...
What are you doing?

00:31.365 --> 00:32.741
Here, I think this new n
will solve your problem.

00:32.783 --> 00:33.742
(GASPS)

00:34.910 --> 00:37.746
What, was it up
your butt or something?

00:37.788 --> 00:39.665
No, just try it.

00:47.589 --> 00:48.549
Mmm, perfect.

00:49.675 --> 00:50.968
Now try your spoon agai.

00:51.010 --> 00:51.802
Okay.

00:53.220 --> 00:54.095
(YELLS)

00:56.473 --> 00:57.516
Now mine.

00:59.768 --> 01:01.102
(SLURPS)
Mmm, yummy.

01:02.604 --> 01:03.480
And yours again.

01:07.651 --> 01:08.443
Ow!

01:10.654 --> 01:12.865
What's going on here?

01:12.907 --> 01:15.409
Well, sir, I grew tired
of you always
burning your mouth

01:15.450 --> 01:17.828
and spitting hot soup
into my face,

01:17.870 --> 01:20.247
so I had a friend who
works in manufacturing
make that spoon.

01:21.248 --> 01:22.624
How do it work?

01:25.044 --> 01:26.962
It's actually two small
spoons welded together

01:27.004 --> 01:28.505
with a liquid cooling at
in between.

01:28.547 --> 01:30.257
Now, the spoon
cools the soup

01:30.298 --> 01:32.091
as you bring it
to your mouth.

01:32.133 --> 01:32.843
(SLURPS)

01:34.553 --> 01:36.638
It works.
It really works.

01:37.180 --> 01:38.306
Yes, indeed.

01:39.433 --> 01:40.809
And now, you're able
to enjoy your soup

01:41.852 --> 01:44.855
and my face will
remain unscathed.

01:44.897 --> 01:46.481
See you later
and good riddance,
stupid old spoon.

01:47.024 --> 01:48.025

to say I love you?

to say that I'm not sc?

02:20.933 --> 02:23.184
So, it's getting close
to baby time.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.561
Do you have her room
all set up yet?

02:24.603 --> 02:26.647
No. As usual,
Jeff's dragging his fee.

02:27.564 --> 02:28.983
Getting him
to help is like

02:29.024 --> 02:31.443
trying to make
a pile of water.

02:31.485 --> 02:33.695
(AUDREY SIGHS)

02:33.737 --> 02:35.238
I need him to move
the old furniture down
to the storage area,

02:35.280 --> 02:36.949
and he keeps
getting distracted.

02:36.991 --> 02:38.700
Mmm, Adam starts
out distracted

02:38.742 --> 02:41.912
and just stays that way.

02:41.954 --> 02:44.164
I think I'm going
to have to resort
to my secret weapon,

02:44.205 --> 02:46.125
which, unfortunately, invols
great personal sacrific.

02:48.710 --> 02:52.506
Maybe you should
just give him sex inste.

02:52.547 --> 02:53.548
Sex is the sacrifice.

02:57.052 --> 02:59.429
Ah, so you tell him
if he does what you wan,
you'll give him some.

02:59.972 --> 03:01.389
Oh, God, no.

03:01.431 --> 03:03.350
If I set that precedent,

03:03.391 --> 03:07.395
he'd be demanding
sex every time I asked
him to pass the salt.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.939
The key is,
I give him some,

03:08.981 --> 03:10.607
then I ask him the favo.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.026
He's so relaxed
and agreeable,

03:12.067 --> 03:13.192
he always says yes.

03:14.695 --> 03:15.403
Hmm.

03:16.530 --> 03:18.073
I wonder if that
would work with Adam.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.534
I really want to get a ,
but he doesn't.

03:20.575 --> 03:22.410
Try my system.

03:22.452 --> 03:24.496
I don't know,
it sounds kind
of manipulative.

03:24.538 --> 03:28.249
Mmm.
Spoken like a woman
without a dog.

03:28.291 --> 03:30.460
All right, I'll try.

03:30.502 --> 03:32.587
Oh, here comes Jeff,
time to bait the trap.

03:32.629 --> 03:33.547
Hey.
(SIGHS) Hey.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.759
I just saw a guy
I thought was
Matthew Modine.

03:39.427 --> 03:40.220
Wasn't.

03:44.975 --> 03:47.435
So, uh, we going
to a movie tonight?

03:47.477 --> 03:49.146
Uh, actually,
I thought maybe
we'd stay in.

03:49.188 --> 03:50.814
I could cook dinner,

03:50.856 --> 03:52.900
maybe share
a bottle of wine?

03:52.941 --> 03:54.943
Oh, well, that sounds
like a roadmap

03:55.986 --> 03:57.779
whose destination
is the boudoir.

04:00.490 --> 04:01.783
Seems that way, huh?

04:02.576 --> 04:05.495
I hope you're watching.

about how to treat your man.

Good, you're here.

What was so urgent, sir?

04:23.764 --> 04:26.516
I can't stop thinking at
our soup spoon inventio.

04:26.558 --> 04:27.601
"Our" invention?

04:28.727 --> 04:30.311
Yes, I'm giving you
full half-credit.

04:32.898 --> 04:34.983
I've decided that
we can market it
and sell it.

04:35.025 --> 04:37.236
Sir, I just had
the one made for you.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.820
Yes, as usual you were
thinking too small.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.663
It's so catchy, man.

Bam!

04:52.292 --> 04:55.045
Sir, why do you
suddenly want to be
in the spoon business?

04:55.087 --> 04:56.880
Ah, I'm sick of riding
my father's coattails.

04:57.714 --> 04:58.966
It's time for me to shi.

04:59.007 --> 05:01.509
Good for you, sir.

I'm very pleased to hear you
so excited about such
a legitimate business ventu.

05:03.762 --> 05:04.846
Yeah, thank you, Tim.

have something

05:07.641 --> 05:11.061

for once, you know?

05:11.103 --> 05:12.187
Actually, ours.

05:13.563 --> 05:15.398
Easy, Tim, remember
there's no "you" in "te"

Nice work, sir.

05:41.091 --> 05:41.883
I know.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.595
Yeah, I, uh, I did that.

05:46.513 --> 05:48.515
(LAUGHING)
You certainly did.

05:51.226 --> 05:52.769

do you think maybe you could

05:52.811 --> 05:54.938
get to cleaning
the storage area,

05:54.980 --> 05:56.273
and moving
the second bedroom
furniture down there?

06:24.676 --> 06:26.636
Really?
Well, that's great.

06:26.678 --> 06:28.930
So I was thinking...
But not a dog.

06:28.972 --> 06:29.806
A bird.

06:30.598 --> 06:31.516
What?

06:32.475 --> 06:33.643
Why do you want
to get a bird?

06:33.685 --> 06:34.602
I don't know.

06:35.729 --> 06:36.813
Just 'cause.

going to sell spoons.

06:47.824 --> 06:50.660

06:50.702 --> 06:52.787

is what I'll need, I gu.

(LAUGHS) Making spoon deals,
Timmy, it's very exciti.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.215
Idea, contact Ricky Schroder
about endorsement deal.

07:06.927 --> 07:09.388
So, sir, I see
you've gone ahead and
formed a business plan.

07:09.428 --> 07:10.680
I have, we're gonna
launch a website,

07:10.722 --> 07:11.973
then post a sales video on .

07:13.641 --> 07:17.979
I'm gonna get more tail
than the guy that
invented the spork.

07:18.021 --> 07:19.898
And where exactly
are we getting
this sales video?

07:19.940 --> 07:20.941
Oh, we're gonna do it.

07:21.524 --> 07:23.235
We'll make it.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.028
I'll be the director
and executive producer.

07:25.070 --> 07:28.240
And what will I be?

07:28.282 --> 07:30.158
You're a good kid, Timm,
we'll find something fo.

07:30.200 --> 07:31.034
And, sir,

07:33.078 --> 07:34.704
you're confident you possess
the necessary skills to shot
a professional video?

07:34.746 --> 07:35.455
Of course.

07:37.207 --> 07:42.587
I learned quite a bit
that week I spent at
soft-core fantasy camp.

07:42.629 --> 07:46.007
And we'll shoot it
on the video equipment
we'll take from my bedroom.

07:46.049 --> 07:46.800
Your bedroom?

07:48.093 --> 07:50.762
But won't the camera
be ruined after I boil ?

07:50.804 --> 07:51.638
Ha, ha.

07:52.889 --> 07:54.433
Idea, try to bang new
receptionist in lobby.

07:55.267 --> 08:01.689
I can't turn it off, Ti.

08:01.731 --> 08:05.235
You know,
these storage lockers
would make great aviari.

08:05.277 --> 08:07.070
Let's try to focus.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.322
I've got to get this
all cleaned out for Aud.

08:08.363 --> 08:09.030
Gotcha.

08:10.740 --> 08:12.784
So, I've narrowed it don
to a macaw or
an African Grey parrot.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.372
Why don't you narrow
it down even further...

08:17.414 --> 08:18.290
to a dog.

08:20.208 --> 08:21.793
Dude, birds are great p.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.795
They're loyal,
they lick your face,

08:23.837 --> 08:25.464
they show up
at the front door

08:25.505 --> 08:28.716
with their little
tail feathers wagging.

a bird is, right?

08:31.094 --> 08:31.845
Yes.

08:34.055 --> 08:37.267
And Jen tried to get me
to agree to a dog
right after we had sex.

08:37.309 --> 08:39.519
Like I owe her
some big favor
after rocking her world.

08:40.603 --> 08:45.275
I don't know where
she got that idea.

08:45.317 --> 08:46.151
Wait a minute.

08:48.236 --> 08:49.946
Speaking of doing thing,
do you think maybe you could

08:49.988 --> 08:51.906
get to cleaning
the storage area,

08:51.948 --> 08:53.700
and moving
the second bedroom
furniture down there?

08:53.741 --> 08:58.579
Absolutely.
Consider it done.

08:58.621 --> 08:59.456
Really?

09:00.290 --> 09:01.791
Audrey uses that with y?

09:01.833 --> 09:03.418
Yeah, and, uh, you know,

09:04.919 --> 09:06.963
I think she's been
doing it for a hell
of a long time.

09:09.632 --> 09:11.218
Is it all right if
my parents stay with us
for a couple of weeks?

09:11.259 --> 09:12.219
Good by me.

09:16.056 --> 09:18.392

we shave this goatee?

09:27.901 --> 09:28.943
Shouldn't we get marrie?

Yeah, sure, why not?

09:33.156 --> 09:34.282

09:35.492 --> 09:37.244
Wow, that scam has
been pretty good to her.

09:39.454 --> 09:40.788
Are you going to go
bust her right now?

09:40.830 --> 09:41.498
No.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.376
Revenge is a dish
best served...

09:45.710 --> 09:46.711
after I get some.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.183
Oh, hey.
Hey.

10:00.225 --> 10:01.560
Did you, uh,
get the storage area
all cleaned up?

10:01.601 --> 10:02.477
As promised.

10:04.645 --> 10:06.773
So, did all the stuff
from the baby's room
fit down there?

10:06.814 --> 10:07.899
I don't know.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.486
I, uh, didn't move it.

10:14.448 --> 10:15.907
Are you gonna
do it soon?

10:15.949 --> 10:19.202
Nah, I kind of
ran out of steam.

10:19.244 --> 10:20.203
But I'll get to it.

10:21.371 --> 10:22.163
Maybe.

10:25.459 --> 10:26.501
Maybe? (LAUGHS)

10:27.710 --> 10:29.546
But last night, you kno,
after we, uh...

10:29.588 --> 10:30.880
Yeah, I know,
but listen...

10:34.675 --> 10:36.677
Cleaning out the locker
just got me a little te.

10:41.349 --> 10:44.769
Well, um, you want me
to get you
a couple of aspirin?

10:44.811 --> 10:46.146
I don't think
that will do it.

10:49.483 --> 10:50.233
(JEFF SIGHS)

10:51.359 --> 10:52.402
Well, why don't we go
to the bedroom,

10:52.444 --> 10:54.654
and I'll give you
a nice massage.

10:54.695 --> 10:56.406

and unexpected idea.

Hey, Timmy.

Oh, hello Mr. Rhodes.

11:10.462 --> 11:11.921
What brings you here?

11:11.963 --> 11:13.548
Oh, Russell told me
to come by.

11:13.590 --> 11:16.635
I'm starring in a movie
or something.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.219
Well, it's not
actually a movie,

11:19.387 --> 11:21.473
it's a web video
to try and sell spoons.

11:21.515 --> 11:22.849
Eh, still getting
my foot in the door.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.894
And this is the set.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.938
That's Hollywood talk fr
the place we'll be film.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.106
It's pretty maj.

11:30.148 --> 11:31.399
Wow.
Yeah.

11:33.234 --> 11:35.445
In fact, Meryl Streep
got her start in a video
very much like this one.

11:36.154 --> 11:38.573
Who's Meryl Streep?

11:38.615 --> 11:40.325
(LAUGHS) I don't know,
I'm too busy watching
the Twilight films,

11:40.367 --> 11:41.576
they're good.

11:42.410 --> 11:43.828
These guys are my lacke.

11:43.870 --> 11:44.871
Lackeys, this is Amber.

11:45.664 --> 11:47.207
Hi. It's Adam, actually.

11:47.582 --> 11:48.375
Hi.

11:49.459 --> 11:50.793
I gotta go potty.

11:50.835 --> 11:51.919
Oh, aren't you adorable?

11:52.795 --> 11:56.007
Well, it's right out th.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.800
Sir, who exactly is she?

11:59.093 --> 12:00.970
She was my counselor
at soft-core fantasy ca.

12:02.681 --> 12:04.474
I promised her
a role in the movie.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.309
Is she my co-star?

12:06.351 --> 12:10.104
'Cause I thought
we had great chemistry.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.024
Mr. Dunbar, I thought
you were taking this
business venture seriou.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.693
Timmy, are you
doubting Amber's ability

12:15.694 --> 12:18.655
to add value
to our sales video?

12:18.697 --> 12:20.865
Russell?
I couldn't find the pot,

12:20.907 --> 12:24.411
and I think
I lost one of my shoes.

12:24.452 --> 12:25.412
Well, are you?

12:31.876 --> 12:32.627
Whew.
Wow.

12:33.127 --> 12:34.254
(CHUCKLES)

12:36.339 --> 12:38.717
That massage got away
from you pretty quickly.

12:38.757 --> 12:40.260
Yeah. I just
couldn't control myself.

12:42.095 --> 12:43.137
Two days in a row.

12:44.805 --> 12:46.057
Haven't done that
in a while.

12:46.433 --> 12:47.267
Yup.

12:48.767 --> 12:51.229
It's going to be tough
to say good-bye
to that streak.

12:51.271 --> 12:52.980
Well, I owe you, hon.

12:53.772 --> 12:56.150
Oh, you don't have to...

12:56.192 --> 12:58.152
Mmm,
you know, actually,
it would be nice

12:58.194 --> 13:00.572
if you could move
that furniture into
the storage area.

13:00.614 --> 13:01.822
I could
definitely do that.

13:02.657 --> 13:03.658
But I don't feel like i.

13:03.700 --> 13:04.492
Great.

13:05.784 --> 13:06.661
Wait, what?

13:08.204 --> 13:11.082
Well, I don't...
(SIGHS)

13:11.124 --> 13:13.918
I don't feel like i.

13:13.960 --> 13:14.753
But...

13:16.630 --> 13:20.300
it would make me so hap,
my big, strong man.

13:21.050 --> 13:22.510
Drop the act, sister.

13:24.137 --> 13:25.096
I'm on to you.

13:27.599 --> 13:30.602
Whatever are
you talking about?

13:30.644 --> 13:32.228
You give me sex,
and then you ask me
to do things.

13:34.230 --> 13:36.357
(LAUGHS) Jeff,
I have no idea what you.

13:37.191 --> 13:39.486
Don't embarrass yoursel.

13:39.527 --> 13:40.903
You've had a good run,

13:41.488 --> 13:42.280
but it's over.

13:45.450 --> 13:46.409
Nicely played.

13:47.786 --> 13:51.164
You got the sex first.

13:51.205 --> 13:54.375
Well, I wasn't
married yesterday.

13:54.417 --> 13:55.251
I win.

13:56.419 --> 13:58.879
Mmm, except,
that most of the sex yot

14:00.256 --> 14:01.800
is based on my system
of needing you to do th,

14:01.840 --> 14:02.883
which is now over.

14:07.597 --> 14:14.771
I win a little less.

14:14.813 --> 14:16.648
What are you doing?

14:16.690 --> 14:20.151
Just reading this latest
issue of Birds USA.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.986
Hey, check out
the crest on this
Northern Lapland, huh?

14:23.946 --> 14:24.656
Whoa.

14:26.658 --> 14:27.534
Yeah, you like
what you see?

14:27.575 --> 14:28.284
I do.

14:30.077 --> 14:33.914
That plumage would
definitely attract a ma.

14:33.956 --> 14:34.708
Well, too bad.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.001
What do you mean?

14:37.043 --> 14:38.586
I mean that until
you agree to get a dog,

14:38.628 --> 14:40.129
I'm withholding sex.

14:40.171 --> 14:41.172
(SCOFFS)
Good luck.

14:44.551 --> 14:45.719
What do you mean,
"good luck"?

14:45.760 --> 14:48.054
You want it
as much as I do.

14:48.095 --> 14:49.556
Plus, I mean, come on.

14:50.765 --> 14:53.560
Look at this, huh?

14:53.601 --> 14:54.894
There's no way
you can resist this.

15:00.983 --> 15:01.984
Huh?

15:02.652 --> 15:03.944
Flat-ish stomach.

15:05.572 --> 15:06.865
Perfect amount
of chest hair.

15:11.952 --> 15:12.746
Oopsie.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.206
Did I drop something?

15:18.000 --> 15:18.668
Oh, yeah?

15:19.586 --> 15:20.795
Well, I can
drop stuff too.

15:26.634 --> 15:27.343
Huh?

15:30.930 --> 15:33.683
Check out these tight b.

15:33.725 --> 15:34.434
Oh, what?

15:35.643 --> 15:38.229
Did somebody say,
"silken, creamy thighs"?

15:39.397 --> 15:40.356
We're getting a bird.

15:40.398 --> 15:41.441
We're getting a dog.

15:41.482 --> 15:42.483
A bird.
Dog.

15:42.525 --> 15:43.359
Bird!
Dog!

15:54.579 --> 15:56.956
Aw, look at
this little guy,
hey, hey there.

15:59.459 --> 16:07.592
Just so you know,
neither of these are
allowed in the building.

16:07.634 --> 16:08.468
Oh, hey.
Hey.

16:10.595 --> 16:12.513
Listen, I've been thinkg
about my whole system

16:12.555 --> 16:15.308
of, you know,
me doing stuff,
so you'll do stuff,

16:15.349 --> 16:16.810
I don't know, maybe
it's good that it's ove.

16:16.851 --> 16:17.644
How so?

16:18.978 --> 16:20.521
Well, from now on,
if I ask you to do somethin,

16:21.773 --> 16:23.483
you'll do it because
you love and support me.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.735
And if we have sex,

16:25.777 --> 16:28.446
it will be solely
as an expression
of our love for each ot.

16:32.742 --> 16:33.701
(BOTH LAUGHING)

16:40.458 --> 16:41.334
Oh, my God,

16:42.877 --> 16:44.963
I can't believe
I got through that
with a straight face.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.840
Yeah, listen, I think
I've come up with, um,

16:47.966 --> 16:49.300
something a little
bit more realistic.

16:49.342 --> 16:50.468
Hmm.

16:52.178 --> 16:56.766
I have put together
a pretty comprehensive
"sex for chores" list.

16:59.978 --> 17:01.646
"Sex for chores"?
Isn't that a little cra?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.731
A little, yes.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.399
But I think it'll really
streamline our marriage

17:06.400 --> 17:10.237
all the way up
until we're dead.

17:10.279 --> 17:11.739
Hmm, all right,
whatever gets us there.

17:11.781 --> 17:12.657
Right? Okay.

17:14.492 --> 17:15.743
So, look, all right,

17:17.370 --> 17:18.872
I know that you want me
to move all the second
bedroom stuff

17:18.913 --> 17:19.455
down to the
storage locker.

17:19.497 --> 17:20.164
I do.

17:21.248 --> 17:25.085
Okay, well,
let's look at the chart.

17:25.127 --> 17:27.630
Under "Household
chores/heavy lifting"

17:28.923 --> 17:31.050
and this is the act that
you'd have to perform.

17:35.346 --> 17:38.766
That seems
a little excessive.

17:38.808 --> 17:40.768
Well, let's just check t
the conversion chart...

17:45.773 --> 17:49.652
and you'll see
that one of those
equals two of these.

17:53.031 --> 17:54.032
Lady's choice.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.123
I've never felt
more like a lady.

18:06.586 --> 18:08.629
How about instead
I give you this.

18:10.339 --> 18:15.344
Oh, please,
I can do that myself.

18:15.386 --> 18:18.806
In fact, let's just
cross this one out.

18:18.848 --> 18:20.058
I'm better at it anyway.

18:25.021 --> 18:28.524
You know, sometimes
you are so annoying,
I wish you'd just shut .

18:28.566 --> 18:29.943
I will...

18:30.568 --> 18:38.993
if you do this.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.954
All right, you guys have
the honor of seeing
the world premiere

18:42.371 --> 18:44.331
of the video that's goig
to launch my new busine.

18:44.373 --> 18:45.541
Our new business.

18:45.583 --> 18:47.418
My new business.

18:47.460 --> 18:48.252
Feast your eyes.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.797
You love
steaming hot soup.

18:57.011 --> 18:58.304
But hate the nightmare
of eating it.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.984
And waiting for it to c,
who has that kind of ti?

19:11.025 --> 19:12.151
(CLOCK TICKING)

19:21.786 --> 19:24.246
You try cooling it
with ice cubes.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.372
(HARP STRINGS CHIME)

19:26.540 --> 19:28.334
But that just makes
it cold and watery.

19:31.004 --> 19:35.299
We can use
the other shot again...

19:35.341 --> 19:37.635
The problem is
your old, outdated spoo.

19:38.136 --> 19:38.970
But wait,

19:40.304 --> 19:41.388
there's a better way.

19:42.015 --> 19:42.932
(MUSICAL CHIME)

19:44.391 --> 19:53.359
That's right,
it's Cool Hand Soup.

19:53.400 --> 19:54.735
The new Cool Hand Soup spoo.

19:56.112 --> 19:59.115
Don't let regular spoons
destroy your life anymo.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.335
Okay,
got the camera set up
on the tripod here.

20:12.628 --> 20:14.505
All right. Let's get
a little weird this tim.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.339
(GIGGLES)
Ooh!

20:19.010 --> 20:20.219
We can edit that out.

20:30.437 --> 20:31.605
All right, that really
didn't work for me.

20:31.647 --> 20:33.107
I think we need
a chunkier soup.

20:33.149 --> 20:39.238
Do we have a chowder?

20:39.279 --> 20:41.323
That's better, but, uh,
let's try a minestrone.

20:42.533 --> 20:47.580
All right, all righ,
just, wait, wait...

20:47.621 --> 20:49.456
You know, I liked that.

20:49.498 --> 20:51.042
But you know what,
let's do one more
tomato again.

20:51.084 --> 20:57.297
All right, I'm done...

20:57.339 --> 20:58.966
Okay, all right,
we're ready to shoot th.
