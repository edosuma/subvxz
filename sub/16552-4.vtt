00:15.807 --> 00:17.226
Come here, my love.

00:17.309 --> 00:18.769
What?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.020
This is it.

00:20.103 --> 00:21.647
-This one's it?
-This is it. I found it.

00:21.730 --> 00:23.649
- Are you serious?
- Yes

00:23.732 --> 00:24.900
I love it.

00:25.901 --> 00:27.569
Well, it's not bad.

00:27.653 --> 00:30.447
Not bad? What do you mean not bad?
It's real nice.

00:30.531 --> 00:32.699
It's one of those
that turns into a bed.

00:32.783 --> 00:34.326
Why do you want a bed?

00:34.409 --> 00:37.829
Well, if we get pregnant,
we're going to have a lot of visitors.

00:37.913 --> 00:39.164
Your parents, my mom.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.708
That is true.

00:41.792 --> 00:44.419
But I feel like it's too hard, right?

00:44.503 --> 00:46.421
Seems too basic.

00:46.505 --> 00:49.299
I don't know, it just seems... basic.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.926
But I like it.
I like the color.

00:51.009 --> 00:52.594
-The color's nice.
-Let me answer this.

00:53.512 --> 00:54.596
<i>Bueno?</i>

00:56.390 --> 00:58.267
- Hi, how are you?
- Hey.

00:58.350 --> 00:59.685
Is there anything
I could help you with?

00:59.768 --> 01:00.769
- Martin?
- Yeah.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.688
Um, I want to see the bed.

01:02.813 --> 01:04.481
Oh, sure,
it's really easy to operate.

01:04.565 --> 01:05.941
Okay.

01:06.024 --> 01:09.069
-You just pull these two tabs here.
-Yeah.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.279
No, nothing, why?

01:10.362 --> 01:12.114
You lift this piece up.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.532
-Oh.
-And then it transforms.

01:13.615 --> 01:14.866
That's really easy.

01:14.950 --> 01:17.160
Yes, I'm actually with her now.

01:17.244 --> 01:18.537
It is pretty big.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.249
- It's comfortable. I like it.
- Also very comfortable, as well.

01:22.332 --> 01:23.792
To Chicago?

01:24.793 --> 01:25.961
Ah.

01:27.504 --> 01:29.214
When do you arrive?

01:30.465 --> 01:33.093
Hey, let me call you back later.

01:33.176 --> 01:35.929
Yes, it's just that we're out shopping.

01:36.013 --> 01:37.055
<i>Adiós.</i>

01:37.139 --> 01:38.640
I actually like it.

01:38.724 --> 01:41.476
Looking at the bed convinced me.

01:41.560 --> 01:42.894
Who was that?

01:43.895 --> 01:45.772
You're not going to believe it.

01:45.856 --> 01:47.024
It was Martin.

01:47.107 --> 01:48.400
Martin?

01:48.483 --> 01:51.194
What did he say?
What does he want?

01:51.278 --> 01:53.405
That he's coming to Chicago.

01:53.488 --> 01:55.324
-He's coming to Chicago?
-Mmm-hmm.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.327
-That's weird.
-I know, right?

01:58.410 --> 02:01.663
But it's cool.
He can stay with us.

02:01.747 --> 02:03.707
-Are you kidding?
-Why not?

02:04.666 --> 02:06.376
We just moved in.

02:06.460 --> 02:07.961
And who cares?

02:08.045 --> 02:09.921
There's no furniture.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.923
There are boxes everywhere.

02:12.007 --> 02:13.925
-Well, but...
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

02:14.009 --> 02:15.427
<i>Sí.</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:17.721
If we buy this couch,
he can sleep here.

02:19.431 --> 02:21.016
-We'll see.
-He'll be the first to use it.

02:22.392 --> 02:25.562
But it's cool!
Come here, sit down.

02:25.687 --> 02:26.980
You like it?

02:27.064 --> 02:28.273
A lot.

02:28.357 --> 02:30.609
That's so weird about Martin.

02:30.692 --> 02:32.569
-I know, right?
-Mmm-hmm.

02:48.502 --> 02:52.839
Why don't you bring it around
the back and I can meet you over there?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.091
- All right.
- Does that work?

02:54.174 --> 02:55.550
- Yeah.
- Let's do it.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.973
Oh, just watch the counter, guys.
Uh, all right, yeah. Just this way.

03:02.057 --> 03:05.102
Right over here in this corner
would be best.

03:05.185 --> 03:06.228
Here, right?

03:06.311 --> 03:09.022
- Oh, oh, oh. Is that--
- Sorry about that, man.

03:09.106 --> 03:11.149
-It's okay, guys.
-All right, it's okay, it's okay.

03:11.233 --> 03:12.609
-Yeah.
-It's okay.

03:12.692 --> 03:14.111
Um, all right, great, that's it.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.278
I'm just gonna need you
to sign for that.

03:15.362 --> 03:16.446
-Sure.
-All right.

03:16.530 --> 03:19.282
-Sorry about that.
-Thank you, guys. Bye.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.879
Aye, no.
I never get it right.

03:35.257 --> 03:36.591
It's so...

03:42.681 --> 03:44.433
Ready.

03:44.516 --> 03:46.601
It says to wait ten seconds.

03:50.772 --> 03:52.524
I think I'm ovulating.

03:52.607 --> 03:54.401
We're due.

03:54.484 --> 03:55.986
So let's get to work.

04:03.285 --> 04:05.245
-Who's that?
-I don't know.

04:05.328 --> 04:06.872
-Are you waiting for someone?
-No.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.373
Mmm.

04:08.457 --> 04:09.833
-I'm going to finish.
-Mmm-hmm.

04:16.465 --> 04:18.216
What the fuck?

04:18.300 --> 04:20.343
Why don't you go check?

04:20.427 --> 04:21.845
I will go now...

04:21.928 --> 04:23.138
-Want me to go check?
-No, I'll go.

04:23.221 --> 04:24.681
Okay.

04:40.655 --> 04:41.823
-Hey!
-Hey!

04:41.907 --> 04:44.367
-How are you, Bernardo?
-How are you?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.535
You got here early.

04:45.619 --> 04:47.829
What's up with those shorts?

04:47.913 --> 04:49.581
Come in!
Were you smoking or what?

04:49.664 --> 04:51.792
You going to be in a show or what?

04:54.085 --> 04:55.587
It's because
they are reflective.

04:55.670 --> 04:57.547
Yeah, but I can't believe
you have them on.

04:57.631 --> 05:00.467
Make yourself at home.

05:00.550 --> 05:02.511
-So this is your new place?
-Yeah.

05:02.594 --> 05:04.012
Were you smoking?

05:04.095 --> 05:05.222
-What?
-Weed?

05:05.305 --> 05:06.348
- Yeah! Who cares?
- Who is it, my love?

05:06.431 --> 05:08.892
- Hey! <i>Hola!</i>
- Look who it is.

05:11.686 --> 05:14.397
-It's good to see you.
-Likewise. How are you?

05:14.481 --> 05:16.191
Good. I missed you guys.

05:16.274 --> 05:17.901
I thought you were arriving
in the evening.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.487
I was gonna arrive later...

05:20.570 --> 05:21.780
but I got here early.

05:47.556 --> 05:48.557
Do you want some?

05:48.640 --> 05:51.601
No, Bernie doesn't like me
to smoke pot.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.144
Since when?

05:53.228 --> 05:55.105
Since a good while.

05:55.230 --> 05:56.940
-Are you serious?
<i>-Sí.</i>

05:57.023 --> 05:59.359
Yes, and look at that mess you made.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.694
What are you talking about?

06:00.777 --> 06:01.945
What do you mean
what am I talking about?

06:02.028 --> 06:03.655
The sofa is new
and you're getting it all dirty.

06:05.031 --> 06:06.074
Mmm.

06:06.157 --> 06:09.202
No, no, do that outside! Please.

06:09.286 --> 06:12.122
-Are you serious?
-Yes, it's going to make the house smell.

06:12.205 --> 06:13.582
Why are you kneeling?

06:13.665 --> 06:16.585
Please, just go outside already.
This is not cool.

06:16.668 --> 06:18.795
Okay, okay, I'll go outside.

06:25.010 --> 06:27.262
How many women have you photographed?

06:27.345 --> 06:29.723
Oh, man, I don't know.
Haven't been keeping track.

06:29.806 --> 06:33.518
- But it's a lot?
- Yes, a lot. Cheers.

06:34.894 --> 06:38.857
- Let's toast to our friendship.
- Mmm-hmm.

06:38.940 --> 06:40.233
Cheers.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.526
I missed you.

06:43.695 --> 06:47.657
Ah! The night is young, right?

06:47.741 --> 06:49.409
- Let's celebrate.
<i>- Sí?</i>

06:49.492 --> 06:51.077
Sure.

06:52.203 --> 06:53.413
What do you want to do?

06:53.496 --> 06:55.373
I don't know.
I came to Chicago to visit you two,

06:55.457 --> 06:56.708
get to know the city.

06:56.791 --> 07:00.295
- Yes, it's still early.
- Let's go dancing! Hmm?

07:00.378 --> 07:04.633
Oh, wow, we haven't gone
out dancing in years, right?

07:04.716 --> 07:07.552
-Yes, it's been a long time.
<i>-Sí.</i>

07:08.928 --> 07:10.555
Actually, we've never gone out dancing.

07:12.474 --> 07:14.976
- At your cousin's wedding.
- You're right.

07:16.436 --> 07:20.732
You mean to tell me, Bernie,
you don't take her out dancing?

07:20.815 --> 07:23.777
You have to take her out!
You guys don't go out?

07:23.860 --> 07:26.196
It's just that in Chicago...

07:26.279 --> 07:28.156
He's always busy.

07:29.074 --> 07:32.410
Chicago is not a great city to go out.

07:32.494 --> 07:33.745
No?

07:33.828 --> 07:35.163
-I don't know.
-Bernie...

07:35.246 --> 07:36.915
You have to enjoy life!

07:38.541 --> 07:41.670
- Another toast.
- Oh, okay.

07:41.753 --> 07:43.588
To living life!

07:43.672 --> 07:46.466
To freedom!

07:47.676 --> 07:49.678
I'm sorry we're not going out.

07:49.761 --> 07:52.180
-But here are the keys.
-Okay.

07:52.263 --> 07:54.099
It's your house now.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.684
You two are like old people.

07:55.767 --> 07:56.851
-What, why?
-Thanks.

07:58.436 --> 08:01.272
I'm going to head out.
If anything, just text me.

08:01.356 --> 08:03.775
<i>-Sí...</i>
-Don't be home late.

08:03.858 --> 08:04.943
No, Mom!

08:07.070 --> 08:10.657
All these years go by and you think
someone's going to change...

08:10.740 --> 08:12.409
and they keep doing the same shit.

08:12.492 --> 08:14.536
Baby, why would you think
he's going to change?

08:14.619 --> 08:17.038
He's the most immature person we know.

08:18.373 --> 08:21.251
But he's very funny...

08:22.252 --> 08:24.421
I don't know, he makes me laugh.

08:24.504 --> 08:26.339
Yeah, I've noticed.

08:28.133 --> 08:30.510
What? It bothers you
that he makes me laugh?

08:32.429 --> 08:36.057
-I don't know. Give me that.
-What's wrong with you?

08:36.141 --> 08:41.479
Oh, nothing. I wanted to see
if you also noticed how sarcastic he is.

08:41.563 --> 08:46.026
But you know that's how he is.
I don't know why you let it bother you.

08:46.109 --> 08:49.529
-Why do you let it get to you?
-He never doubted... I don't know.

08:51.322 --> 08:53.324
You should just relax.

08:53.408 --> 08:56.036
What's so funny?

08:56.119 --> 08:57.370
Nothing.

08:59.914 --> 09:03.418
It feels like it's getting dry,
doesn't it?

09:04.836 --> 09:08.465
-Do you want to stop?
-No, it's fine. One second...

09:09.674 --> 09:12.552
-Okay, there.
-Okay.

09:12.635 --> 09:14.888
-Are you okay?
-Yes.

09:15.889 --> 09:19.601
-Want me to move a different way?
-No, you're fine.

09:19.684 --> 09:21.269
Okay.

09:23.772 --> 09:25.982
Just like that.

09:28.651 --> 09:30.236
Right there.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.047
Are you okay?

09:49.964 --> 09:51.633
Yes.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.009
Why?

09:53.093 --> 09:54.928
You're acting kind of weird.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.308
Do you still have feelings
when you see him?

10:00.391 --> 10:01.768
-Martin?
<i>-Sí.</i>

10:02.769 --> 10:06.231
No, my love.
Why would you think that?

10:06.314 --> 10:09.818
It's only natural.
You two were together for years.

10:09.901 --> 10:14.072
Yes, but...
that was the past.

10:14.155 --> 10:16.491
He did a lot of shitty things.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.660
I have no feelings for him.

10:19.702 --> 10:21.287
That was the past.

10:22.205 --> 10:24.249
You make me very happy.

10:24.332 --> 10:28.002
I have nothing against him,
he's very funny.

10:28.086 --> 10:31.047
He's a great friend.
But that's it.

10:31.965 --> 10:34.300
-I love you.
-Mmm.

10:34.384 --> 10:35.635
I love you.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.970
-Shall we sleep?
<i>-Sí.</i>

10:37.053 --> 10:38.263
Okay.

10:58.366 --> 11:00.743
Hey, wait, wait.
Wait for me.

11:10.962 --> 11:14.424
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with you?

11:17.927 --> 11:19.429
<i>Sí?</i>

11:19.554 --> 11:21.264
- Mmm-hmm.
- Mmm.

11:21.347 --> 11:24.100
<i>-Sí, señor.</i>
<i>-Sí. Sí, señorita.</i>

11:25.977 --> 11:28.521
Oh, man.

11:28.605 --> 11:30.940
- You awake?
- Mmm-hmm.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.611
-Do you hear this?
-Mmm-hmm.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.699
He's with someone, isn't he?

11:40.617 --> 11:43.077
-Mmm-hmm.
-Asshole.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.581
He has no respect.

11:58.301 --> 12:01.346
I want to kill him.

12:04.891 --> 12:08.436
Just stop, my love.
There's nothing we can do right now.

12:10.855 --> 12:13.358
Seriously, there's nothing we can do.

12:15.276 --> 12:17.820
Let's go to sleep.
It'll be okay, my love.

12:57.318 --> 13:00.196
Hey!
Sorry, were we being loud?

13:01.197 --> 13:03.074
Hey, I'm Molly.

13:03.157 --> 13:05.743
Nice to meet you.
Your house is great.

13:07.120 --> 13:08.955
Okay. Well, good night.

13:50.371 --> 13:52.999
I'm going to tell him he has to go.

13:53.082 --> 13:55.209
What?

13:55.293 --> 13:57.253
Babe, are you crazy?
He just got here.

13:57.336 --> 13:58.880
You can't just tell him to leave.

13:58.963 --> 14:00.882
I just don't want him here anymore.

14:00.965 --> 14:03.176
-It doesn't bother you?
-No.

14:03.259 --> 14:05.428
Of course not.
He's our friend.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.889
My love, don't say anything to him.

14:07.972 --> 14:09.348
Seriously.

14:09.432 --> 14:12.518
-I feel like you're acting weird.
-No, I'm fine. Let's drop it.

14:12.602 --> 14:14.062
You're all tensed.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.189
- I don't like it when--
- Mmm!

14:16.272 --> 14:18.900
- It smells delicious!
- Hmm?

14:20.485 --> 14:23.738
-What are you going to do today?
-I want to get to know the city.

14:23.821 --> 14:26.866
- I was told it has beautiful architecture.
- Mmm-hmm.

14:26.949 --> 14:30.286
We can take him to Millennium Park,
or downtown.

14:30.370 --> 14:33.331
Uh, I have a lot of work to do.
You guys go.

14:33.414 --> 14:35.083
My love, how do you have work?
It's Sunday.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.877
Yeah, Bernie, it's Sunday.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.630
I told you about the project
I have to finish.

14:41.381 --> 14:43.049
-I'll take you.
-You sure?

14:43.132 --> 14:45.051
- <i>Sí.</i>
- Okay. <i>Sí.</i>

14:45.635 --> 14:47.178
All right, let's go.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.596
That's fine.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.100
Sorry about that.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.477
I never asked,
how are your parents?

14:54.560 --> 14:56.896
They're good.
They send their regards.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.023
Give them my regards as well.

14:59.107 --> 15:01.109
Yes, I'll tell them.

15:03.152 --> 15:04.946
What's wrong with him?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.323
That's how he gets
when he has a big workload.

15:07.407 --> 15:09.617
-He stresses out.
-Hmm.

15:10.952 --> 15:12.245
-Shall we go?
<i>-Sí.</i>

15:12.328 --> 15:13.413
Are you ready to go?

15:13.496 --> 15:15.748
Just gotta put my boots on and I'm set.

15:15.832 --> 15:17.667
-Okay, let me change, five minutes.
<i>-Sí.</i>

15:29.011 --> 15:31.848
- So what's this?
- Millennium Park.

15:31.931 --> 15:33.975
Oh, this is Millennium Park?

15:35.226 --> 15:37.854
-It's really nice.
-Yes, it's beautiful.

15:37.937 --> 15:39.897
So what's happening?

15:39.981 --> 15:43.609
Are you going to stay here
your whole life?

15:43.693 --> 15:47.780
-Well... yeah, it's great.
-The city is incredible.

15:47.864 --> 15:49.615
I love it.

15:49.699 --> 15:50.950
What about you?
How are you?

15:51.033 --> 15:52.869
-I'm really happy.
-You're really happy?

15:52.952 --> 15:54.537
Mmm-hmm.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.205
I see otherwise.

15:56.289 --> 15:57.915
What do you see?

15:57.999 --> 16:01.210
I see you controlled.

16:02.253 --> 16:04.547
Controlled by what?

16:05.423 --> 16:07.842
Well, it's not that Bernardo is
completely controlling you.

16:07.925 --> 16:12.597
It's that you've decided to be
a different person, Gabi.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.724
This isn't you.

16:14.807 --> 16:16.559
This isn't me?
Then who am I?

16:16.642 --> 16:19.228
-I don't know.
-All right, then, tell me who I am.

16:19.312 --> 16:21.272
Well, you're free-spirited.

16:21.355 --> 16:24.901
You're fun, you're passionate.

16:24.984 --> 16:27.695
And I don't see any of that anymore.

16:27.778 --> 16:32.033
I'm still the same person.
I'm just a little more relaxed.

16:32.116 --> 16:36.287
I'm a little more serene,
with someone who is always there for me.

16:36.370 --> 16:38.414
- Are you listening to yourself?
- Yes.

16:38.498 --> 16:40.750
"A little more serene.
A little more relaxed

16:40.833 --> 16:42.251
with someone who..."

16:42.335 --> 16:45.463
I'm with someone
who gives me security,

16:45.546 --> 16:48.299
and someone who isn't going to leave me
or run out on me all the time.

16:48.382 --> 16:49.592
Like some people I know.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.219
- Like some people?
<i>- Sí.</i>

16:51.302 --> 16:53.054
You're referring to me?

16:53.137 --> 16:55.890
Yes! Who ran out every time?

16:55.973 --> 16:58.851
Well, I ran out because
that's what came naturally to me.

16:58.935 --> 17:01.479
-Oh, what came naturally?
-Learning, seeing...

17:01.562 --> 17:04.106
Well, you know what?
I'm with someone who cares about me.

17:04.190 --> 17:05.274
Who loves me.

17:05.358 --> 17:08.736
Who thinks I'm worthy enough.
And that feels good.

17:08.819 --> 17:11.280
What's wrong?
Why are you so serious?

17:11.364 --> 17:14.200
-Okay, pose.
-I'm fine.

17:14.283 --> 17:17.078
-"I'm fine."
-Okay, what do you want me to do?

17:17.161 --> 17:18.913
I don't know, I'm sorry.

17:20.581 --> 17:22.583
You know who misses you? Bear.

17:22.667 --> 17:23.751
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

17:23.834 --> 17:25.253
Okay, hold that pose.

17:26.587 --> 17:28.923
Come on, a little smile.

17:30.258 --> 17:31.801
-How's Bear?
-He's incredible.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.761
-Really?
<i>-Sí.</i>

17:33.844 --> 17:35.805
So big.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.848
He has a girlfriend.

17:37.932 --> 17:39.058
What? You bought another dog?

17:39.141 --> 17:42.186
-I didn't buy her. I adopted her.
-Uh-huh.

17:42.270 --> 17:45.606
You know I'm against buying dogs.

17:45.690 --> 17:48.150
What's she like?

17:48.234 --> 17:51.529
She's a mix between
a German shepherd and I don't know.

17:51.612 --> 17:52.655
<i>A selfie!</i>

17:52.738 --> 17:55.199
-A selfie?
-A selfie with an antique camera!

17:55.283 --> 17:56.325
Okay.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.536
Like and old-style selfie?

17:58.619 --> 18:00.538
How am I gonna focus that?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.748
-I don't know!
-Stay right there.

18:04.333 --> 18:07.545
- Let's see.
- A selfie with an Olympus.

18:07.628 --> 18:09.880
Let's see.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.260
What's wrong with the negatives?

18:14.343 --> 18:18.389
I just don't get it.
You say you're going to develop them.

18:18.472 --> 18:21.225
When have you ever developed
the pictures you've taken?

18:21.309 --> 18:22.893
What do you mean?
I develop my own negatives.

18:22.977 --> 18:24.145
I've never seen you
develop any rolls.

18:24.228 --> 18:26.355
What are you talking about?
Of course, I have!

18:27.315 --> 18:29.442
That's not true.
All the photos you've taken--

18:29.525 --> 18:32.153
-Don't you remember helping?
-Okay, yes, maybe.

18:32.236 --> 18:34.739
But out of the million photos
you have taken,

18:34.822 --> 18:36.824
you only developed a handful.

18:36.907 --> 18:39.785
What else did you guys do?

18:40.870 --> 18:42.872
What else did we do?

18:42.955 --> 18:44.749
That's all we did.

18:44.832 --> 18:46.000
We did a lot.

18:46.083 --> 18:48.544
- Park, zoo, lake...
- Yes!

18:48.628 --> 18:50.254
-Exactly. It was a lot of fun.
-Mmm-hmm.

18:50.338 --> 18:51.714
Felt like a little kid.

18:51.797 --> 18:54.925
I bet. No adult stuff.

18:55.009 --> 18:59.138
At the same time, why am I going
to take him to a museum?

18:59.221 --> 19:01.807
I know he could care less.
He doesn't even like them.

19:01.891 --> 19:03.476
He's kinda dumb.

19:03.559 --> 19:04.935
Dumb?

19:05.019 --> 19:07.480
I actually love art.

19:07.563 --> 19:11.108
-Oh, well, but you've seen many.
-Well, yes.

19:12.193 --> 19:14.612
That's great.

19:14.695 --> 19:15.946
Tonight, we're going out.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.367
We're going dancing.
And you can't say no.

19:19.450 --> 19:20.951
No, my love...

19:21.035 --> 19:22.536
Not tonight.

19:22.620 --> 19:26.248
-What do you mean we're not going out?
-No, no, no.

19:26.332 --> 19:29.001
You told me you were going
to help me convince him.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.630
No, I don't want to put
that type of pressure on him.

19:32.713 --> 19:34.715
What did we agree on last night?

19:34.799 --> 19:36.926
You too, what did we agree on last night?

19:37.009 --> 19:41.097
-He said we were going out tonight.
-Mmm-hmm.

19:41.180 --> 19:43.099
He didn't want to go out last night,
but tonight he would.

19:43.182 --> 19:45.017
You see?
And tonight, we're going dancing.

19:45.101 --> 19:47.353
-Yes or no?
-Okay.

19:47.436 --> 19:50.606
- Bernie, we don't have to go out.
- He already said yes.

19:50.690 --> 19:52.983
Don't tell him we don't have to go out.

19:53.067 --> 19:56.278
-No, that's fine, we'll go out.
<i>-Sí?</i>

19:56.362 --> 19:58.948
- Let's go somewhere close.
<i>- Sí.</i>

20:10.334 --> 20:12.378
Whoo! Ah!

20:13.421 --> 20:15.005
What's wrong, Bernie?

20:15.089 --> 20:17.633
-You look super bored.
-Don't be rude!

20:17.717 --> 20:19.260
Look at him!

20:19.343 --> 20:21.971
-Let's order another round.
-No, I'm done.

20:22.054 --> 20:24.849
One more! One more!
One more!

20:24.932 --> 20:27.309
Hey, man, can we...
can we have another round?

20:27.393 --> 20:29.562
- I'm good. Thank you.
- Thanks.

20:29.645 --> 20:32.314
- Fine, we can share one.
- No, no...

20:32.398 --> 20:34.275
Yo, Molly just got here.

20:34.358 --> 20:36.277
-You invited Molly?
-Yeah, I invited her

20:36.360 --> 20:40.781
to celebrate
and to have a great time together.

20:40.865 --> 20:41.907
Whoo!

20:41.991 --> 20:43.576
You know, I think I'm going to leave.

20:43.659 --> 20:46.162
-What do you mean you're going to leave?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.289
Bernardo, we came together.
You can't go alone.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.707
You can stay if you want.

20:49.790 --> 20:51.542
What do you mean
I can stay if I want?

20:51.625 --> 20:53.210
What's wrong with you?

20:53.294 --> 20:55.087
Whoo!

20:55.171 --> 20:56.630
-What happened?
-See you later.

20:56.714 --> 20:58.257
What happened?

20:58.340 --> 21:00.050
-Bernardo!
-I'll be right back.

21:00.134 --> 21:01.886
-You sure?
<i>-Sí.</i>

21:03.095 --> 21:05.556
Well, he's leaving.
She's coming back.

21:05.639 --> 21:07.183
I just don't get what's wrong with you.

21:07.266 --> 21:10.394
-Nothing's wrong. I just want to go home.
-What's with your attitude?

21:10.478 --> 21:12.938
What attitude?
I just want to go home.

21:13.022 --> 21:14.315
I'm really tired.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.484
Then why did you agree to go out?
We agreed on two hours.

21:16.567 --> 21:17.651
Gabriela, Gabriela...

21:17.735 --> 21:20.821
Just stay, dance, enjoy yourself.
I have no problem with that.

21:20.905 --> 21:24.074
Only thing I ask of you is
don't drink too much, please.

21:24.158 --> 21:26.827
If we're trying to have a baby,
that's not good.

21:26.911 --> 21:28.412
Are you being serious right now?

21:28.496 --> 21:31.081
Are you trying to control
the amount of alcohol I consume?

21:31.165 --> 21:33.083
Just in case I do end up getting pregnant?

21:33.167 --> 21:35.085
You're going to try
and control that, as well?

21:35.169 --> 21:37.004
I'm sick of you
always trying to control me!

21:37.087 --> 21:38.088
I'm tired of it!

21:38.172 --> 21:40.424
You know what? I'm going to
drink however much I feel like!

21:40.508 --> 21:42.301
That's what I'm going to do!

21:44.887 --> 21:46.222
- Come on, come on!
- Hey.

21:46.305 --> 21:47.598
- Hey, lady.
- Ready?

21:47.681 --> 21:49.266
-Now?
-Yes, now!

21:49.350 --> 21:52.895
- Okay.
- One, two, three!

21:52.978 --> 21:55.397
Cheers!

21:55.481 --> 21:57.441
Mmm! Whoo!

21:57.525 --> 21:59.485
- Let's dance.
- Let's go!

22:20.005 --> 22:21.423
More shots?

22:21.507 --> 22:23.467
- Yeah! You want another one?
- Yes.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.124
<i>- Salud!</i>
<i>- Cheers!</i>

22:56.000 --> 22:58.210
Mmm!

23:00.337 --> 23:02.840
<i>Vamos. </i>

23:56.101 --> 23:57.102
Gabi!

23:59.313 --> 24:00.439
Gabi!

24:01.732 --> 24:04.401
Wait for me!

24:04.485 --> 24:05.527
Gabi!

24:06.487 --> 24:08.364
What are you doing?

24:08.447 --> 24:11.367
-I wanted to leave. I'm tired.
-You aren't tired.

24:12.576 --> 24:16.580
What is wrong with you?
What are you doing?

24:16.664 --> 24:18.957
Why don't you go back?
You were having such a good time.

24:20.167 --> 24:22.378
You're jealous!

24:22.461 --> 24:25.255
Oh, please, give me a break!
You wish I was jealous.

24:26.465 --> 24:28.550
I can't believe this.

24:28.634 --> 24:31.053
You think everyone revolves around you.

24:34.640 --> 24:37.267
-That's enough. Stop it!
-Come here.

24:37.351 --> 24:38.936
Stop what?

24:39.061 --> 24:40.187
What are you doing?

24:40.270 --> 24:42.564
Are you crazy? You're crazy.

26:26.794 --> 26:28.420
I'll leave it here for you.

27:25.143 --> 27:27.855
He left without leaving a note.

27:28.981 --> 27:30.774
He didn't leave anything.

27:37.197 --> 27:38.532
That's funny.

27:39.449 --> 27:42.286
That he would have left
without saying goodbye.

27:43.203 --> 27:44.872
It's weird, right?

27:47.374 --> 27:49.209
It's better this way.

27:49.293 --> 27:50.919
I'd rather us be alone.

27:53.505 --> 27:54.965
<i>-Sí?</i>
<i>-Sí.</i>

27:59.887 --> 28:01.138
Me, too.

28:02.973 --> 28:05.559
How about we have a quickie?

28:06.768 --> 28:07.811
-Right now?
-Mmm-hmm.

28:07.895 --> 28:08.937
-Here?
<i>-Sí.</i>

28:09.021 --> 28:10.063
No.

28:10.147 --> 28:13.817
You're ovulating,
I have 30 minutes...

28:13.901 --> 28:15.777
-Mmm-mmm.
-...before I go to work.

28:18.238 --> 28:19.281
Mmm.

28:19.364 --> 28:20.532
Why not?

28:21.450 --> 28:23.785
The neighbors will see us
if we do it here.

28:23.869 --> 28:26.580
Who cares? Let them see.

28:26.663 --> 28:29.499
Are you crazy?

28:29.583 --> 28:32.127
I'd do that for you.

28:35.756 --> 28:39.676
Okay, fine, but in the bedroom.

28:41.345 --> 28:43.513
Come on, before you have to leave.
