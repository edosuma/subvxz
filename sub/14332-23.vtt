OF ENERGY,

09:02.174 --> 09:04.076
SO I'M GONNA FIGURE OUT
HOW TO POWER THINGS

09:04.143 --> 09:05.177
WITH SOMETHING ELSE.

09:05.244 --> 09:06.846
A POTATO, MAYBE.

09:06.913 --> 09:09.148
- WAIT, NO!
ELECTRICITY'S NOT BAD.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.350
I MEAN,
I'M THE WIND.

09:11.417 --> 09:13.319
- WHAT HAPPENED TO BENNY?
- WHO KNOWS?

09:13.386 --> 09:15.121
I MEAN, STOP BLAMING ME
FOR THINGS.

09:15.187 --> 09:16.589
WHO'S THE NEXT KID?

09:16.656 --> 09:19.792
- OH, THAT'S MEGAN BACON.

09:19.859 --> 09:22.628
- [screams]
NOT MEGAN BACON.

09:22.695 --> 09:25.164
- WHAT'S SO BAD ABOUT HER?
- NOTHING NOW.

09:25.231 --> 09:27.166
BUT WHEN SHE WAS A KID,
SHE WAS THE--

09:27.233 --> 09:29.035
OH, WHAT'S THE WORD?
OH, YEAH--

09:29.101 --> 09:30.803
EMBODIMENT OF EVIL.

09:30.870 --> 09:33.005
- SHE WASN'T THAT BAD, COSMO.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.507
YOU KNOW, TIMMY,

09:34.573 --> 09:36.642
SHE WENT ON TO OPEN
THE CAKE 'N BACON.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.645
- THAT'S MY FAVORITE RESTAURANT.
I WANT TO MEET HER!

09:39.712 --> 09:42.548
- TIMMY, YOU CAN'T INTERACT
WITH HER, REMEMBER?

09:42.615 --> 09:44.850
- OF COURSE NOT.
I'M THE WIND.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.819
LET'S GO!

09:49.221 --> 09:51.657
HEY, WHERE'S THE OLD VERSION
OF YOU GUYS?

09:51.724 --> 09:53.292
- WE WERE HIDING
IN THE CLOSET,

09:53.359 --> 09:54.961
WHICH I'M GONNA GO DO NOW.

09:55.027 --> 09:57.997
SHE'S TERRIFYING, TIMMY.
COME ON, SPARKY!

09:58.064 --> 10:00.833
- WILL YOU TWO MORONS
GET BACK HERE?

10:00.900 --> 10:04.170
- HEY, WHO ARE YOU?
- ME?

10:04.236 --> 10:06.172
OH, I'M, UH, THE MAILMAN.

10:06.238 --> 10:07.673
I JUST CAME IN YOUR ROOM
TO TELL YOU

10:07.740 --> 10:09.408
THERE'S NO MAIL TODAY.

10:09.475 --> 10:11.577
YOU KNOW, SOMEONE TOLD ME
YOU WERE TERRIFYING,

10:11.644 --> 10:12.979
BUT YOU LOOK HARMLESS.

10:13.045 --> 10:14.513
- I'M SWEET AS PIE.

10:14.580 --> 10:15.848
[laughs maniacally]

10:15.915 --> 10:17.350
I'M JUST MISERABLE

10:17.416 --> 10:19.151
'CAUSE MY FAIRIES ARE MAKING ME
DO MY HOMEWORK.

10:19.218 --> 10:20.853
THEY NEVER LET ME PLAY.
- REALLY?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.355
THAT'S CRAZY.

10:22.421 --> 10:24.023
KIDS SHOULDN'T BE OPPRESSED
BY HOMEWORK,

10:24.090 --> 10:25.858
CHORES,
AND RESPONSIBILITIES.

10:25.925 --> 10:28.694
YOU SHOULD DO
WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DO.

10:28.761 --> 10:30.830
- GREAT IDEA,
MR. MAILMAN.

10:30.896 --> 10:33.099
LET'S PLAY SUPER VILLAIN
AND VICTIM.

10:33.165 --> 10:35.501
I'LL BE THE DIABOLICAL
CAPED BACON,

10:35.568 --> 10:37.536
AND YOU'LL BE THE LOSER
I ANNIHILATE

10:37.603 --> 10:38.771
WITH MY BACON BLASTER.

10:38.838 --> 10:40.006
- OKAY.
WAIT, WHAT?

10:40.072 --> 10:41.240
- FEEL THE BURN!

10:41.307 --> 10:42.441
[gun zaps]

10:42.508 --> 10:44.877
- [screaming]

10:44.944 --> 10:46.178
HOT BACON!

10:46.245 --> 10:48.447
YOU'RE THE EMBODIMENT
OF EVIL!

10:48.514 --> 10:50.249
- THIS IS WAY MORE FUN
THAN HOMEWORK.

10:50.316 --> 10:52.752
MY REIGN OF TERROR BEGINS.

10:52.818 --> 10:56.889
- IS THE LITTLE DEMON GONE?
- NAH, HE'S STILL HERE.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.557
HOW'S IT HANGING, TIMMY?

10:58.624 --> 11:02.261
- SPORT, YOU DIDN'T INTERACT
WITH MEGAN, DID YOU?

11:02.328 --> 11:03.929
- ME? NO, WHAT?
MEGAN, WHAT, WHO?

11:03.996 --> 11:05.965
WHY DON'T WE FORGET
THE WHOLE SILLY TIME TRAVELING?

11:06.032 --> 11:08.200
LET'S GO CELEBRATE YOUR
ANNIVERSARY AT THE CAKE 'N BACON

11:08.267 --> 11:10.136
WITH YOUR BEST
FAIRY GODKID EVER.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.637
- WE CAN'T, TIMMY.

11:11.704 --> 11:13.639
LITTLE MAHATMA GANDHI
DIDN'T EAT BACON.

11:13.706 --> 11:16.142
- NO, ME.
I'M THE BEST FAIRY GODKID.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.711
- [laughing]
OH, GOOD ONE.

11:20.379 --> 11:23.149
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT HAPPENED TO DIMMSDALE?

11:28.821 --> 11:31.657
OH, NO, I TOTALLY MESSED UP
THE FUTURE.

11:31.724 --> 11:34.226
I'M THE WORST
FAIRY GODKID EVER!

11:34.293 --> 11:37.830
- IF YOUR DAD WAS HERE,
HE'D TOTALLY PUT A CONE ON YOU.

11:43.269 --> 11:45.504
- SPARKY,
DIMMSDALE GONE CRAZY!

11:45.571 --> 11:47.606
WHAT HAVE I DONE
TO THE WORLD?

11:47.673 --> 11:48.908
[explosion]

11:48.974 --> 11:50.876
- THAT IS MY CUE
TO BERATE YOU, TURNER.

11:50.943 --> 11:52.411
BECAUSE OF YOUR MEDDLING,

11:52.478 --> 11:55.381
LITTLE ERG THE CAVE BOY
NEVER INVENTED THE WHEEL!

11:55.448 --> 11:58.617
- SO THAT'S WHY ALL THE CARS
HAVE WEIRD TIRES.

11:58.684 --> 12:01.454
- EE--DRIVING, OW--
HURTS, OW!

12:01.520 --> 12:04.223
- AND BEN FRANKLIN
NEVER DISCOVERED ELECTRICITY.

12:04.290 --> 12:07.893
- WHICH EXPLAINS WHY DIMMSDALE
IS POWERED BY A GIANT POTATO.

12:09.428 --> 12:11.464
- AND, PERHAPS WORST OF ALL,

12:11.530 --> 12:14.800
THE EARL OF SANDWICH
NEVER INVENTED THE SANDWICH,

12:14.867 --> 12:16.802
WHICH IS WHY I'M EATING
A FISTFUL OF LUNCH MEAT

12:16.869 --> 12:18.704
AND SQUIRTING MUSTARD
INTO MY MOUTH.

12:21.540 --> 12:22.741
[groans]

12:22.808 --> 12:25.010
I WANTED DELI MUSTARD,
NOT DIJON!

12:25.077 --> 12:27.379
YOU DIDN'T MESS WITH THE KID
WHO INVENTED WITH DELI MUSTARD.

12:27.446 --> 12:29.215
DID YOU?
- RELAX, JORGEN.

12:29.281 --> 12:31.750
I'LL JUST GET MY FAIRIES
TO UN-WISH THE WHOLE MESS.

12:31.817 --> 12:33.385
COSMO, WANDA?

12:33.452 --> 12:35.221
- DON'T WASTE YOUR BREATH,
TURNER.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.522
BECAUSE THEY FAILED

12:36.589 --> 12:37.990
TO PREVENT YOU
FROM RUINING THE PAST,

12:38.057 --> 12:40.759
THEY HAVE BEEN FIRED
AS FAIRY GODPARENTS.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.928
- FIRED?
WHERE ARE THEY?

12:42.995 --> 12:46.499
- WELL, COSMO GOT A BIG JOB
IN ADVERTISING.

12:46.565 --> 12:47.833
[choral music]

12:50.402 --> 12:53.172
- 1/2 OFF
ON CELL PHONES!

12:53.239 --> 12:54.406
[shouts]

12:54.473 --> 12:55.941
- WHAT'S A MATTER YOU?

12:56.008 --> 12:58.611
I'M PAYING YOU TO ADVERTISE
MY RESTAURANT.

12:58.677 --> 13:01.747
THE SIGN--SHE CLEARLY SAYS
"PETE'S PIZZA."

13:01.814 --> 13:05.351
- I CAN'T READ THE SIGN.
IT KEEPS SPINNING.

13:05.417 --> 13:06.952
- YOU'RE FIRED!

13:07.019 --> 13:09.588
- YAY!
I HATED THIS JOB.

13:09.655 --> 13:12.324
NOW I CAN LIVE OUT MY DREAM
OF WORKING ON MY TAN

13:12.391 --> 13:14.160
AND SIPPING LEMONADE.

13:14.226 --> 13:17.196
- AND WANDA GOT A JOB
AT THE FAIRY WORLD LIBRARY,

13:17.263 --> 13:19.798
THOUGH I HAVE A FEELING
THAT WON'T LAST LONG.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.102
- [hushed]
EXCUSE ME.

13:23.169 --> 13:24.537
I'D LIKE
TO CHECK THIS BOOK OUT.

13:24.603 --> 13:26.539
- [shouting]
DO YOU HAVE YOUR LIBRARY CARD?

13:26.605 --> 13:30.009
all: SHH!
- USE YOUR INSIDE VOICE.

13:30.075 --> 13:33.212
- THIS IS MY INSIDE VOICE!

13:33.279 --> 13:36.048
- OH, NO, HOW AM I GONNA
FIX THIS WITHOUT MY FAIRIES?

13:36.115 --> 13:38.217
SPARKY,
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?

13:38.284 --> 13:41.320
OH!
I'VE LOST SPARKY TOO!

13:41.387 --> 13:44.623
- NAH, I JUST WENT BACK IN TIME
TO GET MORE BACON.

13:44.690 --> 13:47.126
- WAIT A MINUTE,
IF YOU CAN TRAVEL BACK IN TIME,

13:47.193 --> 13:49.461
THAT MEANS WE CAN FIX EVERYTHING
I MESSED UP.

13:49.528 --> 13:50.663
- WELL, HURRY UP.

13:50.729 --> 13:51.897
I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO

13:51.964 --> 13:53.832
WITH THIS HANDFUL
OF TUNA SALAD.

13:58.304 --> 14:01.540
[game device beeping tune]

14:01.607 --> 14:04.043
- ERG, GAME BAD.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.644
WHEEL GOOD.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.246
- YOU KNOW
I CAN SPEAK, RIGHT?

14:07.313 --> 14:09.215
I TOTALLY JUST BEAT
YOUR HIGH SCORE.

14:09.281 --> 14:10.749
- WHAT?
NO WAY.

14:10.816 --> 14:13.719
TWO-PLAYER MODE,
YOU AND ME, RIGHT NOW.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.754
I MEAN,
JUST FINISH THE WHEEL!

14:18.457 --> 14:20.893
- [grunting]

14:22.595 --> 14:24.830
- OKAY,
FIRST PROBLEM FIXED.

14:24.897 --> 14:27.833
- NEVER SAY "FIXED"
IN FRONT OF A DOG, TIMMY.

14:27.900 --> 14:30.703
- JUST POOF US
TO THE EARL OF SANDWICH.

14:32.972 --> 14:34.340
- THIS IS PERFECT.

14:34.406 --> 14:36.909
I CAN USE THE RYE BREAD
TO MOP UP THIS GRAVY

14:36.976 --> 14:40.212
AND THE PUMPERNICKEL
FOR THE REALLY TOUGH SPILLS.

14:40.279 --> 14:41.981
- OKAY, JUST STOP IT!

14:42.047 --> 14:44.283
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO USE THE BREAD
TO HOLD THE FOOD TOGETHER,

14:44.350 --> 14:45.551
LIKE THIS!

14:45.618 --> 14:46.885
WHERE'S THE ROAST BEEF?

14:46.952 --> 14:48.187
- [muffled]
I DON'T KNOW.

14:48.254 --> 14:49.622
- SPIT IT OUT, SPARKY.

14:49.688 --> 14:51.390
THE FATE OF THE WORLD
IS AT STAKE.

14:55.494 --> 14:59.698
- THIS IS FANTASTIC!
I'LL CALL IT THE SPORTS BRA.

14:59.765 --> 15:01.900
- JUST CALL IT
"THE SANDWICH," BOZO.

15:01.967 --> 15:04.236
- [gasps]
THE SANDWICH BOZO.

15:04.303 --> 15:05.638
THAT HAS A NICE RING
TO IT.

15:05.704 --> 15:07.740
THANK YOU, WEIRD KID
WITH A FEMININE HAT.

15:07.806 --> 15:09.475
- COME ON, SPARKY.

15:09.541 --> 15:12.745
LET'S GO PUSH BEN FRANKLIN
INTO A BOLT OF LIGHTNING.

15:16.615 --> 15:18.784
HEY, BEN,
TIME TO GO BACK OUTSIDE

15:18.851 --> 15:20.552
AND DISCOVER ELECTRICITY.

15:20.619 --> 15:22.921
- BUT POTATOES ARE
THE POWER SOURCE OF THE FUTURE

15:22.988 --> 15:25.958
AND THE PERFECT SIDE DISH
FOR SANDWICH BOZOS.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.926
MAYBE SOMEDAY
I'LL USE A GIANT POTATO

15:27.993 --> 15:30.996
TO POWER A WHOLE TOWN,
KIND OF.

15:31.063 --> 15:34.566
- SOUNDS LIKE THIS DUDE'S
ALREADY BEEN HIT BY LIGHTNING.

15:34.633 --> 15:36.902
- JUST GO.

15:36.969 --> 15:38.137
- [screams]

15:38.203 --> 15:41.006
- ARE YOU ALIVE?
- JUST BARELY.

15:41.073 --> 15:44.176
- GOOD ENOUGH.
OUR WORK HERE IS DONE.

15:47.913 --> 15:49.615
YEAH!
WE DID IT.

15:49.682 --> 15:51.517
DIMMSDALE'S BACK TO NORMAL.

15:51.583 --> 15:53.519
BUT WHY AREN'T
COSMO AND WANDA BACK?

15:53.585 --> 15:55.954
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
I STILL HAVEN'T FIXED.

15:56.021 --> 15:58.524
- PLEASE STOP SAYING "FIXED."

15:58.590 --> 16:01.327
- TIMMY TURNER,
WE MEET AGAIN.

16:01.393 --> 16:03.662
- MEGAN BACON?
IS THAT YOU?

16:03.729 --> 16:05.164
- THAT'S RIGHT, TIMMY,

16:05.230 --> 16:07.032
AND BECAUSE YOU ENCOURAGED ME
TO BE MYSELF,

16:07.099 --> 16:08.934
I NEVER OPENED
THE CAKE 'N BACON.

16:09.001 --> 16:12.271
INSTEAD, I LIVED OUT MY DREAM
OF BEING AN EVIL SUPER VILLAIN,

16:12.338 --> 16:13.939
THE CAPED BACON!

16:14.006 --> 16:15.174
- OKAY, SISTER.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.475
IT WAS CUTE
WHEN YOU WERE TEN,

16:16.542 --> 16:18.110
BUT AN ADULT
BACON-THEMED VILLAIN

16:18.177 --> 16:19.545
IS SUPER LAME.

16:19.611 --> 16:20.979
- REALLY?

16:21.046 --> 16:22.114
LET'S SEE IF YOU THINK
THIS IS LAME.

16:22.181 --> 16:23.649
GREASE RELEASE!

16:27.252 --> 16:28.854
- WHOA!

16:28.921 --> 16:31.390
- WOW, I DON'T KNOW
WHETHER TO BE TERRIFIED

16:31.457 --> 16:32.691
OR LICK THE HIGHWAY.

16:32.758 --> 16:34.693
- SPARKY, WE GOT TO GO
BACK IN TIME

16:34.760 --> 16:36.228
AND STOP HER
FROM BEING HERSELF,

16:36.295 --> 16:37.663
'CAUSE HERSELF STINKS.

16:37.730 --> 16:40.799
- YOU GOT IT, TIMMY.
- NOT SO FAST.

16:40.866 --> 16:42.668
YOUR FAIRY DOG
CAN'T HELP YOU.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.837
IN FACT, NO ONE CAN STOP ME
FROM FULFILLING

16:44.903 --> 16:47.239
MY HIGH-CHOLESTEROL EVIL PLAN.

16:47.306 --> 16:49.308
[laughing]

16:49.375 --> 16:51.744
- HANG ON, SPARKY!
I'LL SAVE YOU!

16:51.810 --> 16:54.713
- TAKE YOUR TIME, DUDE.
SHE'S GOT A LOT OF BACON.

16:54.780 --> 16:55.714
[screams]

16:55.781 --> 16:57.082
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.

16:57.149 --> 16:58.417
I GOT TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT SHE'S UP TO

16:58.484 --> 16:59.418
AND RESCUE SPARKY,

16:59.485 --> 17:02.054
BUT WHERE DID SHE TAKE HIM?

17:02.121 --> 17:05.324
AND I HAVE MY ANSWER.

17:05.391 --> 17:08.160
- HEY, NUT JOB,
I GOT TO WATCH MY CHOLESTEROL.

17:08.227 --> 17:09.494
YOU GOT AN TURKEY BACON?

17:09.560 --> 17:11.497
- TURKEY BACON'S
NOT REAL BACON!

17:11.563 --> 17:13.365
- I GOT TO STOP HER.
OH, I KNOW.

17:13.432 --> 17:15.501
I'LL JUST WAIT
UNTIL HER DIET KILLS HER.

17:15.567 --> 17:18.904
- SOON MY GIANT FRYING PAN
WILL COOK FAIRY WORLD,

17:18.971 --> 17:21.773
AND I'LL DESTROY COSMO AND WANDA
FOR TRYING TO STOP ME

17:21.839 --> 17:23.541
FROM BECOMING
THE EVIL SUPER VILLAIN

17:23.608 --> 17:25.544
I WAS MEANT TO BE.

17:25.611 --> 17:27.045
[cackles]

17:27.112 --> 17:30.215
- NOT SO FAST,
MEGAN BACON.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.617
WHOA!

17:31.683 --> 17:33.385
[grunts]

17:33.452 --> 17:34.953
- NICE TRY, TIMMY,

17:35.020 --> 17:37.689
BUT I'VE COATED THE FLOORS
WITH BACON GREASE.

17:37.756 --> 17:39.191
- WHY?

17:39.258 --> 17:41.026
- IT'S PART
OF MY BACON-THEMED VILLAINY.

17:41.093 --> 17:43.028
- COSMO AND WANDA
WERE ONLY TRYING TO HELP.

17:43.095 --> 17:44.696
THEY JUST WANTED YOU
TO USE YOUR LOVE

17:44.763 --> 17:47.099
OF DELICIOUS COMFORT FOODS
FOR GOOD INSTEAD OF EVIL.

17:47.166 --> 17:52.438
ANYWAY, MY MAGIC DOG AND I
ARE GONNA STOP YOU RIGHT NOW.

17:52.504 --> 17:55.808
GET HER, BOY!

17:55.874 --> 17:58.243
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
