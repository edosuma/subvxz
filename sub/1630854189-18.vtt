WEBVTT

00:03.746 --> 00:05.245
-KAT: Oh.
-Hey.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.063
Hi.

00:06.232 --> 00:07.231
I only have a few minutes

00:07.324 --> 00:08.990
till I have to open the cafe.

00:09.084 --> 00:10.492
How was your stud sesh?

00:11.237 --> 00:12.494
That's an abbreviation
for studio session.

00:12.588 --> 00:14.513
I was trying to save time,
which we have now wasted.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.073
(laughs)

00:16.091 --> 00:18.517
Stud sesh was a buh.

00:19.578 --> 00:21.094
A bust.

00:21.247 --> 00:23.247
I wrote this beautiful song
at 3:00 a.m.,

00:23.265 --> 00:24.672
and then I realized
it was just

00:24.841 --> 00:26.099
"Take Me Home, Country Road".

00:26.252 --> 00:27.601
And when I say "I realized,"

00:27.695 --> 00:30.029
I mean the sound guy said,
"Dude, you just stole that."

00:30.865 --> 00:32.089
Well, am I going
to see you tonight?

00:32.182 --> 00:33.106
I thought maybe
we could write, uh,

00:33.259 --> 00:35.592
"Let's Get It On" together.

00:35.685 --> 00:36.535
(sighs) I wish.

00:36.686 --> 00:38.353
I'm back in the studio.

00:38.522 --> 00:39.613
How about this?

00:39.765 --> 00:40.614
You go into work an hour late,

00:40.708 --> 00:43.042
and we write "Super Freak".

00:43.269 --> 00:44.935
I can't. Randi's coming in late,

00:44.953 --> 00:46.027
so I have to open up.

00:46.196 --> 00:47.454
But I could take an early lunch

00:47.531 --> 00:49.364
and we could have
a little "Afternoon Delight"?

00:49.458 --> 00:52.033
I can't, I've got to meet up
with this singer, Zoey Monroe.

00:52.053 --> 00:53.034
-Really?
-Yeah.

00:53.054 --> 00:54.035
Does it have to be today?

00:54.129 --> 00:55.128
I miss you so much,

00:55.281 --> 00:56.296
I've been leaving one leg hairy

00:56.373 --> 00:57.872
just so it feels
like you're there.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.208
(chuckles)
Aw, I miss you, too.

01:00.227 --> 01:02.895
No, she's coming in from
Tennessee just to meet me.

01:03.122 --> 01:04.045
-Oh.
-Oh, it's a good thing.

01:04.065 --> 01:05.289
She's got a little buzz going,

01:05.307 --> 01:06.807
and my manager is
hoping we get along,

01:06.959 --> 01:08.383
maybe record
some songs together.

01:08.552 --> 01:11.028
Hopefully, she hasn't
heard of John Denver.

01:12.556 --> 01:13.297
How about this?

01:13.465 --> 01:15.574
Tomorrow night, we go to dinner.

01:15.801 --> 01:16.742
Okay, perfect.

01:16.893 --> 01:18.151
Until then,

01:18.304 --> 01:21.305
got a sexy little surprise
to tide you over.

01:21.323 --> 01:24.750
-Mmm.
-It's a naughty picture of me.

01:25.902 --> 01:27.235
If that's you naked,

01:27.254 --> 01:29.313
maybe we should spend
some more time outside.

01:29.331 --> 01:32.332
No, I enlarged the picture,
cut it up into pieces

01:32.409 --> 01:34.151
and I hid the pieces all over.

01:34.169 --> 01:37.321
When you find them, you
assemble them on this board.

01:37.323 --> 01:39.247
It combines the fun
of a scavenger hunt

01:39.266 --> 01:41.433
with the sexiness
of a puzzle. Mmm.

01:41.660 --> 01:43.102
Boobs, boobs.

01:43.329 --> 01:45.495
Where would you hide the boobs?

01:45.589 --> 01:46.346
(Kat laughs)

01:46.498 --> 01:48.014
First clue: check the fruit bowl

01:48.167 --> 01:50.984
for a different kind of melon.

01:52.762 --> 01:54.729
This is your head.

01:54.840 --> 01:56.673
Also known as my melon.

01:56.692 --> 01:58.008
The game is afoot,

01:58.101 --> 01:59.693
which you might
find a picture of

01:59.845 --> 02:01.603
on the shoe rack.

02:01.622 --> 02:03.180
Ooh, I like this game.

02:03.273 --> 02:04.698
When I find the picture
of your feet,

02:04.850 --> 02:05.866
can I give it to the sound guy?

02:05.960 --> 02:08.001
I need to get back
on his good side.

02:17.363 --> 02:19.529
'Cause, according to
our 54 subscribers,

02:19.548 --> 02:20.697
I am still hot.

02:33.136 --> 02:36.730
Now it's time to show you
the pièce de résistance

02:36.882 --> 02:38.064
of our bathroom remodel:

02:38.217 --> 02:40.808
our fancy new Japanese toilet.

02:40.828 --> 02:44.054
<i> Domo arigato,</i> Toilet Roboto.

02:44.072 --> 02:47.407
(chuckles) Ooh, check out
this heated seat.

02:47.559 --> 02:49.459
BOTH:
Ooh.

02:50.320 --> 02:51.077
Now, when it's warm,

02:51.230 --> 02:52.913
I know it's not because this guy

02:53.007 --> 02:53.897
was sitting here
for half an hour,

02:54.066 --> 02:55.823
watching Illuminati videos.

02:55.918 --> 02:58.235
Who are they
and what do they want?

02:59.180 --> 03:00.995
All right, let's take you
into the kitchen

03:01.015 --> 03:03.182
and show you where we're putting
in our brand-new cabinets,

03:03.333 --> 03:05.575
right after a word
from our sponsors.

03:05.669 --> 03:08.470
Just kidding, Home Depot hasn't
responded to my DMs yet,

03:08.522 --> 03:09.930
but they will.

03:10.024 --> 03:12.173
Darren, go get ready to film us
crossing into the kitchen.

03:12.267 --> 03:14.842
Cool, but when
that camera's rolling,

03:14.862 --> 03:17.279
it's Frenzy Boy.

03:20.609 --> 03:22.284
Uh-oh.

03:23.520 --> 03:25.186
Oh, what the hell?

03:25.206 --> 03:26.187
Okay,

03:26.281 --> 03:27.614
I don't want
to point any fingers,

03:27.766 --> 03:29.023
but what did you do?

03:29.192 --> 03:30.858
Me? Why is this my fault?

03:30.878 --> 03:32.402
It's always your fault.

03:33.288 --> 03:35.047
You told me
to install the cabinets,

03:35.198 --> 03:37.699
so I installed the cabinets.

03:37.793 --> 03:39.776
But now there's water
coming out of them.

03:39.945 --> 03:42.036
And they're straight.

03:42.130 --> 03:43.889
Just go turn the water off!

03:44.040 --> 03:45.282
Well, stop yelling at me.

03:45.375 --> 03:48.060
You know I can't think
when my toes are wet.

03:50.122 --> 03:52.289
Hey, do you want to,
uh, come over tonight?

03:52.458 --> 03:54.975
Open some wine,
watch<i> Terms of Endearment.</i>

03:55.127 --> 03:57.218
You'll like it,
the daughter dies in the end.

03:57.312 --> 03:59.813
Oh, sweetheart,
I don't want you dead.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.148
I just want you
completely different.

04:03.469 --> 04:06.728
Unfortunately, I have plans.
Max working late again?

04:06.822 --> 04:08.580
Yeah, he writes all day,
records all night.

04:08.732 --> 04:10.640
He does leave me
cute little notes, though.

04:10.692 --> 04:12.642
"Miss you." "Love you."

04:12.736 --> 04:13.827
"Touch my last Choco Taco

04:13.996 --> 04:16.004
and I'll give you
bangs in your sleep."

04:16.665 --> 04:18.315
-Hey.
-KAT: Hey.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.333
You're wearing your
Kat's Café baseball cap.

04:20.486 --> 04:22.836
Does this mean our
kickball team is back on?

04:22.988 --> 04:24.078
It means I couldn't shower

04:24.098 --> 04:25.338
because we had
to turn our water off,

04:25.507 --> 04:26.914
and this hat has been
in my car since the day

04:26.934 --> 04:28.158
you gave it to me.

04:28.176 --> 04:29.843
Why'd you have
to turn your water off?

04:29.995 --> 04:32.938
Oh, well, I hate to spoil this
week's episode of<i> Hot Lots,</i>

04:33.165 --> 04:35.482
but long story short,
Carter's an idiot.

04:36.835 --> 04:37.943
I think kickball could be fun.

04:38.170 --> 04:40.337
It's hard to make friends
as an adult.

04:40.355 --> 04:42.489
Friends who kick together,
stick together.

04:43.933 --> 04:45.342
Carter punctured a pipe,

04:45.360 --> 04:46.934
and so now
our apartment is flooded.

04:47.029 --> 04:48.436
Oh, that's awful.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.362
Yeah, it's horrible.

04:49.439 --> 04:50.680
You know what's not horrible?

04:50.774 --> 04:52.624
Kickball against rival
neighborhood businesses.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.794
Anyway, now we have
to find some place to stay

04:55.963 --> 04:56.944
for a couple days.

04:56.964 --> 04:58.188
See, if we had a game against

04:58.206 --> 04:59.798
Courtyard by Marriott
in Clarkesville,

04:59.949 --> 05:01.191
we wouldn't even be having
this conversation.

05:01.209 --> 05:02.301
SHEILA:
I don't know how you feel about

05:02.452 --> 05:03.969
staying in a senior community,

05:04.120 --> 05:05.879
but I have an extra room.

05:06.031 --> 05:06.954
Oh, girl, I'm down.

05:06.974 --> 05:08.365
I love old people.

05:08.458 --> 05:09.883
They're the only ones
who don't feel the need

05:10.035 --> 05:10.976
to tell me
that they voted for Obama.

05:11.127 --> 05:12.719
Terrific,
we'll make a night of it.

05:12.871 --> 05:15.872
Wait, hold on, when I asked you
to hang out, you had plans.

05:15.891 --> 05:17.632
Yeah, I lied.

05:17.726 --> 05:20.710
Anyway, come over after work.

05:20.729 --> 05:21.728
You know,
I'm going to go upstairs

05:21.805 --> 05:23.363
and eat Max's last Choco Taco.

05:24.641 --> 05:26.900

I told you about?

Punxsutawney Phil
saw his shadow.

06:10.095 --> 06:11.761
You two actually have
a lot in common.

06:11.780 --> 06:13.263
Uh, Zoey likes cats.

06:13.281 --> 06:14.873

06:15.100 --> 06:17.542

06:20.196 --> 06:22.105

use your apartment.

you eat the fruit

06:26.720 --> 06:27.944

06:27.963 --> 06:29.170
I can't eat
anything with a face,

06:29.223 --> 06:31.932
which sucks because
I love Teddy Grahams.

06:44.721 --> 06:45.962
To be fair, when I Googled her,

06:46.055 --> 06:48.156
her pictures were not that hot.

but she's-she's really talented,

07:00.904 --> 07:02.236
and she's super connected.

07:02.314 --> 07:03.922
Last summer,
she opened for the guy

07:04.073 --> 07:05.239
who opened for the girl

07:05.259 --> 07:07.834
who opened for
Blake Shelton's opener.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.278
Uh, so this is a little awkward.

07:10.280 --> 07:11.245
I was drying my hands,

07:11.414 --> 07:13.765
and a boob fell out
of the towel.

07:14.826 --> 07:16.726

07:18.939 --> 07:21.064
I assume this goes...

07:22.000 --> 07:23.516
...here. (chuckles)

07:23.593 --> 07:26.319
Oh, great, she's good
at puzzles, too?

07:32.602 --> 07:33.893
Uh, Sheila,

07:34.045 --> 07:37.363
do you have any spices
that don't end in "oxodil"?

07:38.200 --> 07:40.292
I find a freshly
ground amphetamine

07:40.443 --> 07:43.853
really balances out
a citrus vinaigrette.

07:43.872 --> 07:45.538
How are your onions
coming, babe?

07:45.707 --> 07:47.132
Oh.

07:47.951 --> 07:49.542
Call me Johnson & Johnson

07:49.711 --> 07:51.452
'cause I've got no more tears.

07:52.531 --> 07:55.098
You look like if Detroit
had a space program.

07:56.960 --> 07:59.060
It's so nice
having you two here.

08:00.129 --> 08:01.721
Here's to the future newlyweds.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.648
Oh. (laughs)

08:03.725 --> 08:05.466
It's also refreshing

08:05.486 --> 08:07.486
to have a couple over
without the expectation

08:07.637 --> 08:08.728
of being their third.

08:08.822 --> 08:09.988
(laughs)

08:10.098 --> 08:12.991
So, how are
the wedding plans coming?

-Oh, I'm gonna kill myself.

08:14.978 --> 08:16.903
We just have so much going on

08:16.997 --> 08:18.388
between that and the reno.

08:18.406 --> 08:19.664
What faucets for the kitchen?

What tile for the bathroom?

08:21.001 --> 08:22.667
Do we invite Drake
to the wedding?

08:22.819 --> 08:24.744
I said no, but then I thought

08:24.896 --> 08:26.671
maybe he'd walk me
down the aisle.

08:27.566 --> 08:29.399
Have you picked a song
for your first dance?

08:29.492 --> 08:32.827
Oh, I want something romantic
like "At Last" by Etta James

08:32.846 --> 08:34.996
or "Baby Got Back"
by Sir Mix-a-Lot.

08:35.015 --> 08:37.349
We should skip
the formal dance altogether.

we have three left feet,

you won't let me lead.

it is to be dipped?

to be a math professor.

10:18.601 --> 10:22.679
Who's your favorite
mathematician, Purr-thagoras?

10:22.697 --> 10:24.013
What the hell?

I just want you to know,
I am only here for the work.

When I was in New Orleans,

10:47.130 --> 10:48.371
I went to Bourbon Street.

10:48.464 --> 10:50.223
I did not know what
the beads meant at first,

10:50.317 --> 10:52.225
and let me tell you, those frat
guys at S-A-E were S-A-D.

10:52.377 --> 10:55.136
My point is, I have no interest
in Max whatsoever.

10:55.230 --> 10:56.303
He's not my type.

10:56.323 --> 10:58.198
Okay, I'm liking her more.

10:58.900 --> 11:00.158
If I glance over again,

11:00.309 --> 11:01.976
it's just to make sure
people are still watching.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.995

who said I had pretty toes.

11:10.987 --> 11:12.653
So, Max said
you're from Tennessee?

11:12.673 --> 11:14.898

called Stinking Creek.

Whoa, look who's taking

16:13.047 --> 16:14.955
racy photos of themselves now?

16:15.049 --> 16:16.808
Oh, be careful around
the cats, though.

16:16.959 --> 16:19.018
They might think
that's a scratching post.

16:19.871 --> 16:20.720
(chuckles)

16:20.888 --> 16:22.205
So, are you coming home?

16:22.207 --> 16:25.057
Mmm, actually, Zoey and I...

16:25.210 --> 16:27.727
<i> MAX:</i>
<i> Snowball. Off. Not a toy.</i>

16:27.879 --> 16:28.878
Zoey and I

16:28.896 --> 16:29.970
are doing some karaoke,

16:30.048 --> 16:31.823
and I can confidently say

16:31.974 --> 16:33.716
we're the best
singers in the room.

16:33.735 --> 16:34.734
You want to join?

16:34.828 --> 16:35.885
Yeah, he can be Tony

16:35.887 --> 16:36.977
when we do Tony! Toni! Toné!

16:36.997 --> 16:38.070
Oh, no, but I want to be Tony.

16:38.239 --> 16:39.739
-The other Tony.
-Right, yes, great.

16:39.815 --> 16:41.557
Yeah. What do you think?

16:41.650 --> 16:43.835
Uh, I'm gonna pass.

16:44.062 --> 16:45.670
I mean, I've been singing
every night this week.

16:45.897 --> 16:47.188
Why would I want to do karaoke?

16:47.190 --> 16:49.173
Besides, you already
called the good Tony.

16:50.068 --> 16:52.251
Seriously, Max?
We've hardly seen each other,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.071
including tonight
when you blew off our dinner.

16:55.164 --> 16:56.347
I know we haven't
seen each other.

16:56.499 --> 16:58.257
That's why I was hoping
you would come home.

16:58.351 --> 17:00.910
Okay, well, I'm not
just gonna bail on Zoey

17:00.928 --> 17:02.002
because you
broke the soundboard.

17:02.096 --> 17:03.396
<i> I didn't break it.</i>

17:03.581 --> 17:05.081
But if you're not allowed
to have soda in that room,

17:05.099 --> 17:06.916
there should be a sign.

17:07.769 --> 17:10.102
So you'd really
rather hang out with Zoey?

17:10.255 --> 17:11.254
We're having fun.

17:11.272 --> 17:12.938
Cool, I guess
I'll see you whenever.

17:13.015 --> 17:15.015
<i> I guess so.</i>

17:15.035 --> 17:17.201
-Snowball, no!
-(Snowball yowls)

17:19.748 --> 17:21.039
It's fine
if you want to go home.

17:21.207 --> 17:22.948
Oh, please. I mean,
I'm supposed to drop everything

17:23.043 --> 17:24.450
just because his plans
fell through?

17:24.602 --> 17:27.211
I don't see him giving up
studio time for me.

17:28.030 --> 17:29.455
Trust me, I know how tough

17:29.607 --> 17:31.107
this business is
on relationships.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.776
You have to sacrifice
so much to make it.

17:33.869 --> 17:35.294
I don't want
to be an afterthought.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.221
You sure you don't
want to go home?

17:37.298 --> 17:39.465
I'll go tell Ice
to pull the car around.

17:39.559 --> 17:40.874
(laughs) No.

17:40.894 --> 17:42.727
I just want to sing.

Okay, Sheila,

18:07.236 --> 18:08.644
have you done your Ancestry.com?

18:08.663 --> 18:10.830
'Cause I think you've got
some Black in you.

18:10.982 --> 18:13.740
Ernie Hudson,
the Black Ghostbuster,

18:13.835 --> 18:15.242
told me the same thing.

18:15.261 --> 18:17.411
Ooh. All right, now that
I've wiggled my wobble,

18:17.430 --> 18:20.080
it's time to show y'all
my signature dance move.

18:20.100 --> 18:21.824
Oh, Lord, give him some room.

18:21.917 --> 18:24.051
(shouting)

18:24.604 --> 18:26.521
Oh, God. Okay. Ooh.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.850
You know who can do that?

18:31.002 --> 18:33.361
Ernie Hudson,
the Black Ghostbuster.

18:34.763 --> 18:35.929
Are you okay?

18:35.949 --> 18:37.523
Blink twice if you need me
to help you up.

18:37.617 --> 18:38.783
I can't blink.

18:39.010 --> 18:40.860
Then the tears will fall.

18:40.954 --> 18:42.286
Oh. Okay, okay, slow.

18:42.513 --> 18:44.180
-Okay. Okay, baby. Ah.
-Slow. Mm.

18:44.273 --> 18:46.182
Baby, can you run home
and get my medicine?

18:46.275 --> 18:47.867
-Okay.
-No. No, you don't
need to go home.

18:47.961 --> 18:50.202
I have a spice rack
full of medicine.

18:50.296 --> 18:52.371
Oh, we just have
a specific strain of

18:52.523 --> 18:54.781
"aspirin" that works well
in situations like this.

18:54.801 --> 18:56.634
Yeah, aspirin.

18:56.861 --> 18:58.027
Also, don't forget the weed.

18:58.087 --> 18:59.545
But, wait, you can't go home.

18:59.697 --> 19:00.863
Why not?

19:00.882 --> 19:02.548
Um...

19:02.642 --> 19:04.809
I can't remember.

19:05.036 --> 19:08.062
Oh, the ravages of age.

19:09.131 --> 19:10.982
Okay, Sheila, what's up?

19:11.133 --> 19:12.466
Randi, she just told you.

19:12.635 --> 19:14.527
She old.

19:15.897 --> 19:17.880
Your apartment is fine.

19:17.973 --> 19:19.565
You can go home anytime.

19:19.717 --> 19:22.843
Then why did you tell us
that we couldn't?

19:22.920 --> 19:23.977
(sighs)

19:23.997 --> 19:26.747
Well, this is
embarrassing to admit.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.816
I really like you guys.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.669
I can't have a threesome.

19:31.896 --> 19:32.837
I'm injured,

19:33.064 --> 19:34.463
but I can watch
you two do stuff.

19:35.991 --> 19:37.842
I mean I like this.

19:38.069 --> 19:40.252
Having you here.

19:40.346 --> 19:43.497
You make me feel... young.

19:44.017 --> 19:45.741
I mean, making friends
here is like...

19:45.834 --> 19:49.912
getting attached to the lobster
you pick out in the restaurant.

19:49.931 --> 19:52.081
Why didn't you just
ask us to hang out?

19:52.099 --> 19:53.249
I didn't think you'd want to

19:53.267 --> 19:55.084
if you didn't need
a place to stay.

19:55.102 --> 19:57.177
Oh, but Sheila, we love
spending time with you.

19:57.271 --> 19:59.554
And Carter's gonna spend a lot
more because he can't move.

19:59.607 --> 20:01.090
How about this?

20:01.108 --> 20:02.700
Why don't we just
make a standing date?

20:02.851 --> 20:04.927
Yeah. Yeah, every Thursday

20:05.020 --> 20:06.520
at your place.
Dinner and drinks.

20:06.539 --> 20:07.888
And you can show us
more of the moves

20:07.890 --> 20:09.448
that you dropped
on Ernie Hudson,

20:09.600 --> 20:11.292
the Black Ghostbuster.

20:12.103 --> 20:14.462
That would be wonderful.

CARTER:
Aw.

20:18.200 --> 20:20.125
This is such a sweet moment.

20:20.278 --> 20:22.611
