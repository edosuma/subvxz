09:43.709 --> 09:46.542

for areas suffering drought.

- Hmm.

So if someone ever asks you
what do you do,

09:56.250 --> 09:59.291
you just say "good." Ha-ha-ha.

09:59.291 --> 10:01.083
Yeah,
that's why I wanna get the building.

10:01.083 --> 10:04.917
Because I wanna convert it into
solar-powered green spaces,

10:04.917 --> 10:07.792

don't have to pay for energy.

on a plane once.

11:09.291 --> 11:11.291
But we crossed
the International Date Line

11:11.291 --> 11:13.291

being a two-night stand but--

11:13.291 --> 11:16.709
It was not a one-night stand, okay?

because you also hate Seth.

But I like basketball players.

11:37.750 --> 11:40.917

Someone who cares less
about what's out there,

19:07.917 --> 19:10.125
- more about what's inside.
- Don't touch me.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.375
And I'm gonna be there.

19:11.375 --> 19:13.750
Because I know it's right and so do you.

19:14.625 --> 19:16.834
- You're crazy.
- No, I'm right.

19:16.834 --> 19:19.083
No, you're gross.

19:20.583 --> 19:23.000
But this is really good and I'm taking it.

19:28.000 --> 19:29.333
Hey, that's mine.

19:29.875 --> 19:31.291
- Oh.
- Jeez, if I'd known

19:31.291 --> 19:32.959
you were gonna carry me for ten blocks,

19:32.959 --> 19:34.417
I wouldn't have had dessert.

19:34.750 --> 19:36.959
- Aah. Aah.
- Aah.

19:36.959 --> 19:38.000
No,

19:38.291 --> 19:40.000
it's my fault.

19:40.000 --> 19:43.917
I walk everywhere and I forget
that pretty girls like to wear pretty shoes.

19:54.959 --> 19:56.917
I'll call you tomorrow.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.250
SAM:
<i>One way to build self-respect</i>

20:01.250 --> 20:04.250
<i>is to surround yourself</i>
<i>with people you admire</i>

20:04.250 --> 20:06.834
<i>who also admire you.</i>

20:06.834 --> 20:08.750
I'm not carrying you to the elevator.

20:08.750 --> 20:10.458
Shh.

20:15.917 --> 20:17.291
<i>But at the end of the day,</i>

20:17.291 --> 20:19.917
<i>no matter how much</i>
<i>someone else cares about you,</i>

20:19.917 --> 20:22.625
<i>you have to respect yourself.</i>

20:22.917 --> 20:24.917
<i>To be able to look yourself</i>
<i>in the mirror.</i>

20:24.917 --> 20:26.000
TODD:
Sam, you're home late.

20:26.375 --> 20:28.000
Long day?

20:28.000 --> 20:29.417
Uh-- Yeah.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.667
Yeah, I was like, "Mom, I wanna go home"
and she was like:

20:33.333 --> 20:34.709
"No." Heh.

20:35.417 --> 20:37.417
Yeah, I'm exhausted.

20:37.417 --> 20:39.792
- Night.
- Night.

20:45.166 --> 20:46.709

has a roommate on the side.
