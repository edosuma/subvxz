00:04.921 --> 00:08.257
- Hey.
- Hey. So, what do you think?

00:09.134 --> 00:15.472
New haircut? Necklace? Dress?
Boots? Boots!

00:15.640 --> 00:21.603
Yes! They're a little more than
I usually spend on boots. Um, or rent.

00:21.771 --> 00:22.938
Oh, my God.

00:23.106 --> 00:27.109
- I know.
- I'll miss being able to afford food.

00:27.569 --> 00:31.363
I'm sorry. They just looked so good.
The saleswoman was like:

00:31.531 --> 00:34.783
- "These are too expensive for you."
- She had a point.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.830
- Hey.
- Hi. Oh, my God.

00:39.998 --> 00:45.586
- Oh, Monica, those boots are amazing!
- They're mine!

00:46.171 --> 00:52.176
- Too bad we'll have to return them.
- Return them? Shh! They're gonna hear you.

00:52.343 --> 00:53.635
I'm not returning them.

00:53.803 --> 00:57.473
I know they cost a lot,
but I'll wear them all the time. You'll see!

00:57.640 --> 01:00.726
Besides, I love the compliments.

01:00.894 --> 01:03.645
Have you ever had something
everyone wants?

01:03.813 --> 01:06.899
- I have you.
- Nice try. I'm keeping the boots.

01:47.565 --> 01:50.526
That's right. I love you.

01:50.693 --> 01:55.030
And I'm gonna play with you
all the time.

01:55.198 --> 01:59.201
How can you let him talk
to your crotch like that?

02:01.371 --> 02:05.374
- He's talking to the baby.
- Oh! Okay.

02:07.127 --> 02:10.419
Okay. When he said, "I can't wait
to hear your first words"...

02:10.588 --> 02:12.548
...I thought, "There's a trick."

02:14.968 --> 02:17.970
Okay, well I gotta go, you guys.
I'll see you later.

02:18.138 --> 02:19.221
- Okay.
- All right.

02:19.389 --> 02:20.472
Bye.

02:21.558 --> 02:23.100
- Oh, hey, Rach. Um...
- Hi.

02:23.268 --> 02:27.020
Can you do me a favor? My sister
knows you work at Ralph Lauren...

02:27.188 --> 02:30.357
Forget it! No way.
I'm not sending more clothes to prison.

02:30.525 --> 02:33.360
- It is a waste.
- No! Not her.

02:33.528 --> 02:37.072
My youngest sister, Dina.
She's interested in fashion.

02:37.240 --> 02:40.409
She wants to talk to someone successful
to give her some advice.

02:40.577 --> 02:44.413
- I'll talk to my supervisor.
- No, no. She wants to talk to you.

02:44.581 --> 02:48.876
Really? Oh, my God. I'm successful.

02:50.295 --> 02:53.255
- Would you meet with her?
- I'd love to. Have her come by.

02:53.423 --> 02:58.343
Great. You'll love her. She's the smartest
of all the Tribbiani children.

02:58.511 --> 02:59.970
- Yeah, you know the SATs?
- Yeah.

03:00.138 --> 03:02.181
She took them.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.643
Hey, Ross,
doesn't Ben go to Smithfield School?

03:06.811 --> 03:07.853
Yeah. Why?

03:08.021 --> 03:11.315
- Sting has a son that goes there.
- I know. He's in Ben's class.

03:11.482 --> 03:13.233
You knew and never said anything?

03:13.401 --> 03:17.154
With all the stupid
dinosaur stuff you tell us?

03:17.780 --> 03:21.909
Fine, no more dinosaur stuff.
Can I talk about fossils?

03:28.833 --> 03:31.793
"Sting's son, 7." There's a picture.

03:31.961 --> 03:36.632
What are you reading? "A Kidnapper's
Guide to Manhattan Private Schools?"

03:36.799 --> 03:40.552
It's New York Magazine, an article
about the best schools in the city.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.223
- So how well do you know Sting?
- I haven't met him.

03:44.390 --> 03:49.811
Uh-huh. That's too bad. I wanna go to
his concert Friday, but it's sold out.

03:49.979 --> 03:54.066
I know! Why don't you meet him
and get tickets?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.944
If you get two, I'll take you.

03:57.111 --> 03:59.613
I'm picking Ben up tomorrow.
Maybe he'll be there.

03:59.781 --> 04:04.409
There you go. Ugh, you're so lucky.
You might meet Sting tomorrow.

04:04.577 --> 04:07.246
That's why you have kids.

04:13.878 --> 04:15.337
- Hey, guys.
- Hey.

04:15.505 --> 04:19.091
Hi, Monica. Hi, boots.

04:20.426 --> 04:22.928
See? I'm getting a lot of use
out of them already.

04:23.096 --> 04:27.557
They're very practical. You can wear them
with dresses, skirts, pants...

04:27.725 --> 04:31.520
Wear them with shorts on the corner
and earn money to pay for them.

04:33.398 --> 04:37.567
- Wow, they're beautiful.
- They hurt so much.

04:37.735 --> 04:39.861
- What?
- The guy who made these...

04:40.029 --> 04:43.323
...hates feet
and wants to see them die.

04:43.491 --> 04:47.035
Give them to me.
I haven't felt my feet in years.

04:47.203 --> 04:51.331
I can't. I spent so much on them, and
told Chandler I'd wear them all the time.

04:51.499 --> 04:54.793
- I can't just give them away.
- Then get your money back, return them.

04:54.961 --> 04:56.044
I can't do that either.

04:56.212 --> 05:01.258
The soles are scuffed up, and the
insides are filled with my blood.

05:03.011 --> 05:04.052
- Hey.
- Hey.

05:04.220 --> 05:07.431
- Hey, I, uh, just picked up Ben from school.
- Oh.

05:07.598 --> 05:09.975
I don't think you did
a very thorough job.

05:11.352 --> 05:13.603
I dropped him off at Carol's.

05:13.771 --> 05:16.606
Anyway, I'm not gonna
get those tickets.

05:16.774 --> 05:18.608
Oh, no. Why not?

05:18.776 --> 05:22.154
Well, it turns out Ben and Sting's son
do not get along.

05:22.322 --> 05:25.324
- How come?
- Apparently, Sting's son made fun...

05:25.491 --> 05:28.869
...of the fact that Ben's moms
are "les-be-nims."

05:29.704 --> 05:33.332
Wait! If they don't get along,
you should smooth things over.

05:33.499 --> 05:37.252
- Make them be friends.
- You can't force kids to be friends.

05:37.420 --> 05:40.756
Sure you can. Give them some blocks.
Put them in a playpen.

05:41.507 --> 05:46.303
- Playpen? Ben's 7.
- Your kid is 7?

05:46.471 --> 05:48.638
He's really small.

05:50.350 --> 05:54.144
- Please! Please get the tickets.
- I'm sorry. I just can't do it.

05:54.312 --> 05:58.106
- Yes, you can. Sting says so himself.
- What?

05:58.274 --> 06:01.318
Ross can!

06:03.571 --> 06:04.905
Look, Pheeb, I'm sorry...

06:05.073 --> 06:08.325
Ross can!

06:09.869 --> 06:10.911
Phoebe?

06:11.079 --> 06:16.375
Ross can get me the tickets!

06:22.715 --> 06:25.717
Here she is.
Future fashion superstar.

06:25.885 --> 06:29.888
- Oh, Joey, I'm hardly...
- My little sister, Dina!

06:30.056 --> 06:32.057
- Right. Hi, Dina. Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

06:32.225 --> 06:35.519
Thanks for meeting me.
Joey's told me so much about you.

06:35.686 --> 06:37.437
This is exciting for her.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.815
Well, I'll let you two fash...

06:39.982 --> 06:42.692
...ists get down to business.

06:43.903 --> 06:46.238
Okay. All right, Dina.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.825
Let's talk about the different
areas of fashion...

06:49.992 --> 06:52.619
...you could get involved in.

06:52.787 --> 06:56.373
Let's see. There's design.
But you may need another degree for that.

06:56.541 --> 06:59.960
Uh, there's sales, which is great.
You get to travel.

07:00.128 --> 07:02.504
I don't care about fashion! I'm pregnant.

07:02.672 --> 07:04.798
And I know you are too,
so you gotta help me.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.220
And there's marketing.

07:17.728 --> 07:20.564
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

07:23.484 --> 07:26.111
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

07:32.910 --> 07:35.537
- What's wrong?
- Oh, nothing. I'm just... I just was yawning.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.959
Don't forget my office
holiday party tonight.

07:41.127 --> 07:43.462
We don't really have to go tonight,
do we?

07:43.629 --> 07:46.298
Sweetie, I know that you don't like
my office parties.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.718
- But you can wear your new boots.
- Ha, ha.

07:49.886 --> 07:53.597
See? Every cloud has
a supple leather lining.

07:54.932 --> 07:58.477
- I don't wanna wear the boots tonight.
- Why not?

07:58.644 --> 08:03.148
I'm worried your bosses might see them
and think they pay you too much money.

08:03.316 --> 08:06.776
Or your assistant will see them
and want a raise.

08:07.445 --> 08:11.072
Do you think I work at
a boot-pricing company?

08:11.240 --> 08:14.826
Anyway, I picked an outfit,
and the boots don't go with it.

08:14.994 --> 08:16.661
You said you paid all that money...

08:16.829 --> 08:19.831
...because those boots go with skirts,
dresses and pants.

08:19.999 --> 08:22.751
Fine, if you want me to wear the boots,
I'll wear the boots.

08:22.919 --> 08:25.795
In fact, I'll go in to my room now
and try the outfit on.

08:25.963 --> 08:27.130
- Okay.
- Okay.

08:29.634 --> 08:31.510
Ooh-wee! Ha, ha.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.471
Christmas party in my boots!

08:34.639 --> 08:36.640
Ha, ha, ow, ha, ha, ow.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.687
I can't go in there. I can't tell him.

08:42.855 --> 08:46.775
It'll be okay.
He's been incredibly supportive of me.

08:46.943 --> 08:51.738
And if he gets a little upset,
that's what the meatball sub is for.

08:52.281 --> 08:54.115
- Thank you.
- Okay.

08:55.326 --> 08:58.995
Hey! It's my fashion girls!

09:01.582 --> 09:03.708
- What's wrong?
- Why don't you sit down?

09:03.876 --> 09:06.169
Dina has something
that she wants to tell you.

09:06.379 --> 09:10.966
Oh. What's going on? Is it Mom?

09:11.133 --> 09:15.804
Is she sick? Is it Dad's heart?
Is that a sandwich?

09:18.975 --> 09:22.686
- Joe, Mom and Dad are fine.
- Is that a sandwich?

09:24.063 --> 09:30.068
Joey, there's something
that you should know. Dina?

09:31.153 --> 09:34.573
- I'm pregnant.
- What?

09:34.740 --> 09:37.033
Now. Give him the sandwich.
Give him the sandwich!

09:38.119 --> 09:41.705
Obviously, this is a mistake.
You can't be pregnant.

09:41.872 --> 09:44.374
You have to have sex to get pregnant.

09:45.293 --> 09:48.545
Joe, I tried to wait until
I was 25, like you did.

09:50.256 --> 09:52.424
- What? Dina...
- Bub!

09:52.633 --> 09:53.925
Sh...

09:55.261 --> 09:59.973
I can't believe this! You're
the good one. You went to college.

10:00.141 --> 10:02.809
Both years!

10:03.978 --> 10:07.856
- Who did this to you?
- Bobby Corso. But he's a real nice guy.

10:08.024 --> 10:09.858
I like him a lot. He's real funny.

10:10.026 --> 10:12.611
You got pregnant for "funny"?

10:12.778 --> 10:16.865
Dina, if he's funny, laugh!

10:19.619 --> 10:22.621
- I'll be back in a while. Stay here!
- Why?

10:22.788 --> 10:26.166
I can't look at you right now.

10:28.002 --> 10:31.630
- Wow.
- I know.

10:45.519 --> 10:48.146
Oh, there you are, Ben.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.523
Aunt Phoebe, what are you doing here?

10:50.691 --> 10:53.234
I heard you have a problem
with a boy in your class.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.570
And so I thought
I'd just come down here...

10:55.738 --> 10:58.948
...I'd sit you both down,
have a talk and make it all okay.

10:59.116 --> 11:02.952
Now, um, the boy's name is Sting's son.

11:03.871 --> 11:06.706
Jack? I hate him. He's a jerk.

11:06.874 --> 11:10.877
Now, Ben, sometimes people may seem
like jerks on the outside...

11:11.045 --> 11:13.588
...but they have famous fathers.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.384
I have to go.
My friend Doug is waiting for me.

11:17.551 --> 11:19.928
Him you're friends with.

11:25.226 --> 11:28.061
Excuse me,
can I help you with something?

11:28.229 --> 11:31.398
Yes. Yes you can.
I'm looking for Jack's parents.

11:31.565 --> 11:34.401
- Are you with a student?
- Uh-huh. I'm with Ben.

11:34.568 --> 11:38.697
- Are you one of Ben's mothers?
- I am one of Ben's mothers.

11:39.907 --> 11:42.283
I'm a lesbian.

11:42.451 --> 11:45.120
It was difficult coming out
to my parents.

11:45.287 --> 11:49.791
Heh, well, hi. I'm Jenny Boon.
I'm the new teacher here.

11:49.959 --> 11:52.252
- Oh.
- I've only met your partner, Carol.

11:52.420 --> 11:55.588
- Ah! Okay, that would make me Susan.
- Heh.

11:55.756 --> 11:59.676
Right. Are you looking
for Jack's parents to discuss...

11:59.844 --> 12:02.512
...the problems he's having with Ben?
Yeah.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.682
I think the parents should sit
down together and converse.

12:05.850 --> 12:08.393
Yeah, let's do that!

12:09.520 --> 12:12.355
That sounds good.
We should sit and talk.

12:12.523 --> 12:15.775
Just me, my lover, Carol, and the Stings.

12:15.943 --> 12:20.280
- How will I get in touch with them?
- Their number's on the contact sheet.

12:20.448 --> 12:26.786
Uh-huh. Um, could I get a copy of that?
Carol threw it out. She lost ours.

12:26.954 --> 12:31.791
She's such a scatterbrain.
But, man, what a hot piece of ass.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.760
- That wasn't bad.
- I didn't know there'd be dancing.

12:41.927 --> 12:44.471
That was a fun surprise!

12:44.638 --> 12:48.808
- I don't see any, uh, cabs. We should walk.
- No, we can't walk.

12:48.976 --> 12:51.853
It's, like, 15 blocks to the subway.
Let's go.

12:52.021 --> 12:57.108
Do you think we can get to the subway
if we climb through that manhole cover?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.737
- What's going on?
- I can't walk, okay? Okay?

13:00.905 --> 13:03.990
- These boots were a huge mistake.
- What?

13:04.158 --> 13:06.284
You were right.
I never should've bought them.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.245
They're killing me, one toe at a time.

13:09.413 --> 13:13.333
I was right. This is what
it feels like to be right.

13:14.502 --> 13:17.587
It's oddly unsettling.

13:17.755 --> 13:20.757
How are will gonna get home?
Maybe a piggyback ride?

13:20.925 --> 13:22.884
- Hop on.
- Okay, wait. Give me a second.

13:23.052 --> 13:25.220
Let me just get my boots off first.

13:27.348 --> 13:28.765
Ow.

13:31.393 --> 13:32.644
Oh, God.

13:37.817 --> 13:42.028
Honey, I know you're in pain
right now, but I'm a little turned on.

13:46.617 --> 13:51.538
Do you worry that you'll be walking
and your baby will slip out?

13:53.624 --> 13:56.793
What college was that, Dina?

13:58.003 --> 14:00.505
Oh, my God! Bobby?

14:00.673 --> 14:04.551
Hi, Dina. Good to see you.

14:04.718 --> 14:09.222
- Joey, what are you doing?
- Just what needs to be done.

14:09.390 --> 14:13.810
- Dearly beloved, we're gathered here...
- Ugh, Joey, this is crazy.

14:13.978 --> 14:17.230
Don't interrupt me
when I'm talking to God!

14:17.398 --> 14:21.067
- Where were we? Do you take this man...?
- No!

14:21.235 --> 14:23.236
- Oh, you'll take him.
- No I won't!

14:23.404 --> 14:25.446
- Hey, you don't get a say.
- Yes I do.

14:25.614 --> 14:28.533
Ah, I heard "I do." We're halfway there.
Okay, you.

14:28.701 --> 14:30.910
All right, Joey, that is enough!

14:31.078 --> 14:34.622
Listen, as beautiful and moving
as this ceremony is, this is not legal.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.710
They don't have a marriage license,
they don't have witnesses...

14:38.878 --> 14:41.254
...and the groom only has on one shoe.

14:41.422 --> 14:45.008
Yeah, he took the other one off
and hit me with it.

14:45.718 --> 14:46.926
What am I supposed to do?

14:47.094 --> 14:51.139
You're supposed to realize they are adults
and can make their own decisions.

14:51.307 --> 14:53.892
No, they can't.
They're stupid enough to get knocked up!

14:54.059 --> 14:56.102
Hey!

14:57.229 --> 15:00.690
Contraceptives are not always
effective. Right?

15:01.400 --> 15:07.614
- Yeah. We kind of didn't use any.
- Oh, come on, kids, a little help here.

15:11.827 --> 15:15.496
Wow! This place is incredible!

15:17.791 --> 15:22.629
Sting's pen. That he gave to Phoebe.

15:27.551 --> 15:31.596
Come on, secret passageway.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.600
- Hi.
- Hi.

15:35.809 --> 15:38.645
- I'm Trudie. You must be Ben's mum.
- Uh-huh.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.230
Why else would I be here?

15:41.398 --> 15:43.191
- Why don't you sit down?
- Uh-huh.

15:43.359 --> 15:45.610
I gather Jack and Ben
haven't been getting along.

15:45.778 --> 15:49.238
- Yeah.
- I'm sure there are two sides to this.

15:49.406 --> 15:53.117
But all I've heard is that Ben's
a bit of a "poo-poo head."

15:53.285 --> 15:56.329
Um, I'm sorry.
Won't Jack's father be joining us?

15:56.497 --> 15:58.665
I'm sorry, Jack's father's not available.

15:58.832 --> 16:00.792
Mm-hm. Okay.

16:00.960 --> 16:04.837
Well then could we reschedule
for Friday night, perhaps at 8:00?

16:05.005 --> 16:07.715
Oh, no, that wouldn't work.
My husband's in concert.

16:07.883 --> 16:13.846
Concert. Yeah.
Mm. That just put us in quite a pickle.

16:14.014 --> 16:16.891
Because I'm very busy before
and after the concert...

16:17.059 --> 16:18.810
...and he's obviously busy during.

16:18.978 --> 16:22.271
So you and I should talk about
Jack and Ben now.

16:22.940 --> 16:25.942
Unless... Unless, um...

16:26.110 --> 16:29.487
Okay, I would be willing
to go to the concert...

16:29.655 --> 16:33.199
...um, all the while
thinking about the children of course.

16:33.659 --> 16:38.037
- Are you here for tickets?
- Ugh, thanks. Four would be great.

16:39.081 --> 16:43.001
I'm not giving tickets to someone
who'd use their son like this.

16:43.168 --> 16:46.129
Oh, then you're in luck.
Ben's not my son.

16:47.297 --> 16:50.383
I've pressed a button
triggering an alarm.

16:50.551 --> 16:54.887
- Any minute now, the police will be here.
- The Police? Here?

16:55.055 --> 16:58.057
A reunion? Ooh!

17:04.314 --> 17:08.693
Okay, 10 blocks down, five to go.

17:08.861 --> 17:13.823
- Oh, wait! Stop!
- Oh, I'm sorry. Do you need a break?

17:14.992 --> 17:18.161
My boots in tan!
Get closer so I can see the price.

17:18.328 --> 17:22.832
I can see it from right here.
It'll cost you one husband.

17:23.000 --> 17:28.003
Okay, I think I can walk the rest
of the way now. Just give me my boots.

17:28.589 --> 17:32.216
- I don't have your boots.
- I don't either. Where are they?

17:32.384 --> 17:34.510
Why don't you check
in one of my saddlebags...

17:34.678 --> 17:37.388
...while I chew on a bale of hay?

17:38.348 --> 17:41.642
Okay. My God, we gotta go back
and get them!

17:41.810 --> 17:45.605
Are you seriously
ever gonna wear the boots again?

17:45.773 --> 17:51.903
Okay, I'll never wear them again.
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.822
Know what? You can say goodbye
to the tan ones.

17:54.990 --> 17:59.911
- Okay. All right. Unh.
- Okay.

18:00.079 --> 18:04.665
Bye, boots. Wait! Half off!

18:06.627 --> 18:08.836
Joey, because they're not
getting married...

18:09.004 --> 18:10.838
...doesn't mean this is a disaster.

18:11.006 --> 18:15.968
- Maybe they have a plan.
- Oh. Oh! Okay, let's hear their plan.

18:16.136 --> 18:19.305
What's the future look like
for Dina and Bobby?

18:19.473 --> 18:24.602
Well, I really have high hopes
for my band.

18:25.646 --> 18:29.232
You were right. He is funny.

18:29.399 --> 18:33.820
Wait! I bet when you told people
you wanted to act, they laughed at you.

18:33.987 --> 18:36.948
Bobby, tell us a little
about your band.

18:37.116 --> 18:42.120
It's just me and my pal, Rooster.
The band's name is Numbnuts.

18:45.749 --> 18:46.999
Really?

18:48.627 --> 18:51.921
Dina, if you're having a baby,
you should be married.

18:52.089 --> 18:55.967
Even if it is to Bobby.
Dude, that's not a compliment.

18:57.427 --> 19:01.139
- I knew you wouldn't be supportive.
- What are you gonna do?

19:01.306 --> 19:05.226
You're gonna have the baby and raise it
by yourself, without a husband?

19:05.394 --> 19:09.313
You can't be a single mother alone!
You're gonna ruin your life!

19:09.481 --> 19:13.985
- Excuse me. Am I ruining my life?
- No, no, it's different for you.

19:14.153 --> 19:15.528
You're strong and together.

19:15.696 --> 19:18.406
You're not some dumb kid
who doesn't know what she's doing.

19:18.574 --> 19:23.286
- Excuse me?
- One pregnant woman at a time, please!

19:24.663 --> 19:27.123
I just want you to be okay.

19:27.291 --> 19:29.876
Forcing her to marry Bobby
is gonna make that happen?

19:30.043 --> 19:32.128
Maybe.

19:33.714 --> 19:37.967
Yeah. So, uh, what kind of music
does Numbnuts...?

19:38.135 --> 19:40.803
Ah, forget it! I can't!

19:40.971 --> 19:43.764
Joey, I am scared to death
about this.

19:43.932 --> 19:46.642
But I think I can do it.
I just need some help.

19:46.810 --> 19:50.771
- And Bobby's gonna be here the whole time.
- You bet I am.

19:50.939 --> 19:55.943
To answer your earlier question,
we're straight-up gangster rap.

19:59.698 --> 20:03.284
Rachel's told me how much easier
you've made this on her.

20:03.452 --> 20:07.455
- Why can't you do that for me?
- Because!

20:07.623 --> 20:09.582
Because you're my baby sister!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.250
And you're my big brother.

20:11.418 --> 20:14.670
I mean, you're my favorite guy
in the whole world.

20:14.838 --> 20:20.426
I'm not even scared to tell Mom
and Dad. I was scared of telling you.

20:21.261 --> 20:24.138
I'd be scared of them, but all right.

20:24.306 --> 20:28.809
I can't stand the thought of
having this baby with you mad at me.

20:28.977 --> 20:31.938
I want him to have his uncle.

20:32.105 --> 20:34.523
Is my baby gonna have his Uncle Joey?

20:36.860 --> 20:40.655
Of course he's gonna have
his Uncle Joey.

20:41.281 --> 20:47.495
We'll be all right. Even if we're not
married, this baby is gonna be so loved.

20:47.663 --> 20:50.915
- And not just by us.
- That's right.

20:51.083 --> 20:56.712
- By his uncle too.
- And by you.

20:59.466 --> 21:04.887
Okay, Bobby, come over here and let them
have a little moment, okay?

21:08.684 --> 21:11.102
Come here!

21:12.396 --> 21:15.106
No, seriously, what's wrong with you?

21:19.945 --> 21:24.031
You're gonna love me so much.
I got Sting tickets!

21:24.199 --> 21:27.952
Oh, my God, I do love you!
How did you do it?

21:28.120 --> 21:30.121
Well, let's just say:

21:30.289 --> 21:33.416
Ross can!

21:33.834 --> 21:35.084
Ohh!

21:35.252 --> 21:37.378
- Where are the seats?
- Middle balcony.

21:37.546 --> 21:39.964
Would you say that that's
more than 50 yards away...

21:40.132 --> 21:43.926
...from Sting, his wife,
or a member of his family?

21:44.094 --> 21:45.970
- Yeah.
- Then that's not breaking the law!

21:46.138 --> 21:48.097
I'm there!
