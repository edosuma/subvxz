WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:01.450
Previously on The O.C.

00:01.460 --> 00:03.232
I thought you were going to be
a silent partner.

00:03.233 --> 00:04.433
Came to see my girlfriend.

00:04.434 --> 00:04.896
What?

00:04.897 --> 00:06.684
You need new recruits,
right? So sign us up.

00:06.685 --> 00:10.051
Your date doesn't pay you.
That... that's illegal.

00:10.086 --> 00:10.658
Right.

00:10.659 --> 00:13.596
I could put off RISD for a semester.
We could both go back together.

00:13.597 --> 00:15.091
You'd really put off college for me?

00:15.097 --> 00:17.070
- You take it...
- It's yours...

00:18.113 --> 00:18.997
I found you.

00:18.997 --> 00:20.300
I just had the weirdest dream.

00:20.305 --> 00:23.132
- You were in it, I think.
- I think you were in my dream, too.

00:23.139 --> 00:24.583
I'm really glad you're here.

00:29.215 --> 00:30.573
Hey, I asked you a question.

00:30.577 --> 00:33.903
Yeah, no, it's just some of these bugs
are really sort of stubborn.

00:33.936 --> 00:34.930
I was using that.

00:34.935 --> 00:37.183
Now you're not.
Gonna tell me what's going on?

00:37.338 --> 00:39.942
What if I told you it's New Year's Eve
and we're on our way to Vegas?

00:39.947 --> 00:42.170
I might hit you with this.
Why are the girls acting so strange?

00:42.178 --> 00:44.542
I don't... I mean...
you know, I don't know.

00:44.577 --> 00:45.871
How long is it supposed to take?

00:45.876 --> 00:47.300
Five minutes.
How long has it been?

00:47.305 --> 00:49.293
Okay-- four minutes and 47 seconds.

00:50.036 --> 00:51.832
You're lying. It's written all over you face.

00:51.838 --> 00:54.440
Well, then I shouldn't bluff
when we get to Las Vegas.

00:54.446 --> 00:56.742
Look... what... man, they're in the bathroom.
Why don't you just ask them.

00:56.745 --> 00:57.731
13 seconds left.

00:57.737 --> 00:59.850
Do I need to remind you
why you're even here right now?

00:59.856 --> 01:00.930
11 more seconds.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.520
Because you haven't killed me yet?

01:02.528 --> 01:03.571
What if there wasn't enough pee?

01:03.575 --> 01:06.223
No, because you didn't have any
New Year's Even plans so you hijacked mine.

01:06.227 --> 01:08.570
- How many bars am I looking for?
- Two, two bars.

01:08.576 --> 01:09.773
Six more seconds.

01:09.838 --> 01:11.803
- I told you I'd pay you back.
- Oh, my God, I can't look.

01:11.806 --> 01:13.660
And now I'm collecting.
So tell me what's happening.

01:13.668 --> 01:17.013
Oh, my God, three more seconds,
two more seconds, one more second...

01:23.616 --> 01:23.743
SEVEN

01:23.747 --> 01:24.043
SEVEN HOURS

01:24.045 --> 01:26.272
SEVEN HOURS EARLIER

01:26.966 --> 01:28.161
Here you go.

01:28.738 --> 01:30.260
Last coffee of '06.

01:30.698 --> 01:32.660
How much you hoping
I don't make that joke all day?

01:32.668 --> 01:33.792
Not like I'll be around to hear it.

01:33.798 --> 01:37.012
So walk me through your itinerary again.
You've got breakfast with Taylor.

01:37.017 --> 01:39.200
Back home to pack,
quick lunch, off to Vegas.

01:39.218 --> 01:40.652
She still doesn't know you're taking her?

01:40.658 --> 01:41.823
Well, that's why it's a surprise.

01:41.825 --> 01:44.212
He's told me nothing.
And I just thought, you know,

01:44.217 --> 01:48.612
since he went to all of this trouble it would
be nice for me to surprise him, too, and...

01:50.165 --> 01:51.802
Summer, are you even listening to me?

01:51.805 --> 01:53.623
What? No... yeah...
every word.

01:53.655 --> 01:57.031
- 'Cause you seem kind of out of it.
- I'm sorry, I'm just still waking up.

01:57.048 --> 01:58.890
You guys seem pretty serious, though?

02:01.775 --> 02:01.803
It's that old adage-- couples
who have comas together, stay together.

02:01.808 --> 02:03.563
She won't think Vegas is cheesy, will she?

02:03.568 --> 02:05.722
Do you think it's cheesy to get him lingerie?

02:05.726 --> 02:08.759
Obviously, I'm going to be wearing it,
but it's really for him.

02:08.764 --> 02:11.292
- Look, Taylor...
- You're right. It's way too soon for lingerie.

02:11.296 --> 02:14.032
Is he going to think I'm some kind
of kinky, sex-starved, divorcee?

02:14.035 --> 02:15.101
You're being paranoid.

02:15.106 --> 02:20.381
Still, be careful, 'cause people, they go
to Vegas and they come back married.

02:20.426 --> 02:21.850
What about you and Summer-- any plans?

02:21.858 --> 02:23.470
Well, if it's a typical night for us,

02:23.485 --> 02:29.301
I'm probably in for some Korean cinema,
manga and making new friends on MySpace.

02:29.348 --> 02:30.653
In other words...

02:30.697 --> 02:32.281
No "plans"-- that's a dirty word.

02:32.286 --> 02:34.933
That's right up there
with "responsibility" and "future."

02:34.935 --> 02:37.893
There'll be plenty of time for that
when we're in college.

02:38.246 --> 02:39.710
And she's on board with that?

02:40.565 --> 02:41.212
Totally.

02:41.218 --> 02:43.972
I  hope I don't have to kill him.
When are you meeting Ryan?

02:43.977 --> 02:46.573
Ooh, now.
All right, I will see you tomorrow.

02:46.805 --> 02:48.901
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year, Summer.

02:49.495 --> 02:52.552
Same to you. Good luck tonight.
I'm sure everything will just be great.

02:52.558 --> 02:53.912
Oh, speak of the devil.

02:53.916 --> 02:54.911
Summer.

02:55.625 --> 02:56.281
Atwood.

02:56.287 --> 02:57.481
- Taylor.
- Hi.

02:57.677 --> 02:59.601
You looking forward to your surprise tonight?

02:59.605 --> 03:02.331
I am. Are you looking forward to yours?

03:02.368 --> 03:03.070
I am.

03:03.076 --> 03:04.272
Ew. That's my cue.

03:05.277 --> 03:07.273
Okay, here it is.

03:07.318 --> 03:09.090
- What is it?
- Open it.

03:11.885 --> 03:13.163
- Hey.
- Hi.

03:13.607 --> 03:15.520
I wanted to talk to you
about what we're doing tonight.

03:15.526 --> 03:19.723
Why talk when actions speak
so much louder than words.

03:19.757 --> 03:20.711
What is it?

03:20.717 --> 03:22.163
I don't know.
Just open it.

03:22.405 --> 03:23.403
Okay.

03:24.307 --> 03:25.840
- Oh, my.
- Surprise.

03:27.557 --> 03:28.823
"Jamaican me crazy."

03:28.828 --> 03:30.483
It's funny because it's not.

03:34.178 --> 03:35.082
Do you think I'm a whore?

03:35.086 --> 03:36.320
What? No, no.

03:36.355 --> 03:38.681
It's just... I already have this.

03:39.598 --> 03:40.593
You nut.

03:40.986 --> 03:43.330
For a second there, I was like,
oh, major miscalculation.

03:43.335 --> 03:45.433
No, no, no.
It's going to be a great night.

03:46.316 --> 03:47.760
All right, come here.

03:48.917 --> 03:51.761
Yeah... You didn't make any plans
for us tonight, did you?

03:51.795 --> 03:54.733
- Well, I thought we would just...
- What "Jamaican" up as you go?

03:54.745 --> 03:58.143
You are such a baby. I'm done
baby-sitting you. Do you understand me?

03:58.367 --> 03:59.363
I'm done.

05:03.528 --> 05:05.682
I'm not questioning the fantasy, Spencer.

05:05.725 --> 05:08.172
We've all imagined doing it
with the delivery boy.

05:08.178 --> 05:10.920
I am questioning whether
we should be paying for the pizza.

05:10.925 --> 05:12.060
It's starting to add up.

05:12.068 --> 05:14.370
We're running a male prostitution ring, Julie.

05:14.685 --> 05:16.252
Pizza's the cost of business.

05:17.548 --> 05:20.182
Hey, who did we...?
Who'd we set Petrie Marchand up with?

05:20.185 --> 05:21.831
That guy you call the Mambo King.

05:23.167 --> 05:25.712
My real question--
what do you know about money laundering?

05:25.716 --> 05:27.342
That'd be nothing. Why?

05:27.378 --> 05:29.863
Because it's the holidays
and we're busy

05:29.865 --> 05:34.190
and I can't keep filing
all this cash under "extra money."

05:33.225 --> 05:36.422
- I'll, um... I'll see you later at the place.
- Yeah.

05:37.567 --> 05:40.443
That was Jimmy on the phone.
He's supposed to call Kaitlin at midnight?

05:40.448 --> 05:40.922
Yeah.

05:40.938 --> 05:43.272
Well, he's hosting a party on his boat.

05:43.308 --> 05:47.550
And he wanted you to tell Kaitlin he's sorry,
but he might be out of cell phone range.

05:47.646 --> 05:48.840
Poor Kaitlin.

05:50.166 --> 05:53.930
I know she doesn't show it,
but I think she really, really misses him.

05:54.947 --> 05:56.113
Can  I help you with something?

05:56.115 --> 05:57.113
No, no.

05:57.916 --> 05:58.831
No, I'm good.

05:58.836 --> 06:02.272
Julie, I appreciate you handling
the bookkeeping, but honestly,

06:02.305 --> 06:03.662
I probably have more experience.

06:03.667 --> 06:06.991
Well... all the more reason
for me to learn.

06:07.036 --> 06:10.130
I mean, what if you get hit
by a bus or something?

06:10.616 --> 06:11.810
God  forbid.

06:12.218 --> 06:13.912
Threre must be something I can do.

06:15.836 --> 06:18.632
Give me more coffee?
I got it at the place on the corner.

06:22.705 --> 06:25.112
Somebody going on a coffee run?
I'll take a latte.

06:25.656 --> 06:26.760
Hello, sweetheart.

06:26.768 --> 06:29.133
Just thought I'd drop off
an invite to my soiree.

06:29.138 --> 06:32.070
Yeah, Gordon, you know,
I received like 11 of these in the mail.

06:32.073 --> 06:34.537
Well, now you've got an even dozen.
So read it to me.

06:34.537 --> 06:39.170
"Gordon Bullit invites you and
a hot guest to start 2007 with a bang."

06:41.415 --> 06:43.112
That joke never gets old, does it?

06:43.149 --> 06:44.801
Been using it since 1989.

06:45.598 --> 06:46.590
So, uh...

06:46.638 --> 06:47.800
what time do you want me to send a limo?

06:47.805 --> 06:51.130
You know, honestly, I'm not sure
that I'll get through with everything here.

06:51.137 --> 06:56.230
Damn it, hotcakes, when I bankrolled this operation,
I thought I'd see you more, not less.

06:56.268 --> 06:57.980
Since I got back from Riyadh,

06:58.026 --> 07:01.052
we've had two dinner dates
and zero hanky-panky.

07:01.097 --> 07:03.013
Well, it's a new business, Gordon.

07:03.056 --> 07:08.320
Well, hey, look, at least let me get you a bean counter
to take care of some of the paperwork.

07:08.367 --> 07:10.271
Bullit, let me have that back.

07:11.147 --> 07:13.693
Wow, you girls eat a mess of pizza.

07:13.728 --> 07:15.953
We work through dinner a lot.

07:16.098 --> 07:20.862
Look, I really appreciate the gesture, Bullit,
but I would prefer to do this on my own, hmm?

07:22.356 --> 07:23.351
Okay.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.300
You coming tonight?

07:27.176 --> 07:28.172
If I can.

07:30.916 --> 07:32.111
Damn, woman.

07:35.546 --> 07:36.993
And he requested me?

07:37.877 --> 07:40.621
Yeah, all right, all right.
I'll see what I can do.

07:41.427 --> 07:42.420
Okay.

07:43.047 --> 07:44.441
Working on New Year's Eve?

07:44.446 --> 07:47.723
Yeah, one of your homeless guys
from Thanksgiving attacked a parking meter.

07:47.728 --> 07:50.622
He couldn't remember his name,
but he remembered mine.

07:50.667 --> 07:52.191
I was talking about the sandwiches.

07:52.196 --> 07:55.070
Oh, yeah, Ryan's putting
together a cooler for Vegas.

07:55.518 --> 07:56.623
I'm his sandwich guy.

07:56.628 --> 07:58.972
Cohens are natural sandwich artists.

07:59.238 --> 08:00.732
It's like our very own super power.

08:00.737 --> 08:04.132
Yeah, I don't know if it qualifies us
for the Justice League, though.

08:05.408 --> 08:06.602
What's up?

08:06.728 --> 08:08.652
You've got that "something's up"
look on your face.

08:08.657 --> 08:10.473
Well, you know, probably 'cause something's up.

08:10.478 --> 08:12.720
- What'd you do?
- More like what I didn't do.

08:13.088 --> 08:16.462
Turns out Summer's expecting me to make
some elaborate New Year's Eve plans.

08:16.465 --> 08:20.963
Oh, romantic holiday plans--
definitely not a Cohen super power.

08:21.005 --> 08:23.200
We've got nine months
until we go to college.

08:23.225 --> 08:25.641
This is the last time in our lives
we don't have to worry about stuff.

08:25.647 --> 08:28.612
Yeah, yeah, the ladies
don't really buy that line, though.

08:28.655 --> 08:31.551
You still have to show her
that you value her. My advice...

08:31.667 --> 08:35.613
Put some thought and effort into making
some real New Year's Eve plans, pronto.

08:36.385 --> 08:37.851
Well, my work here is done.

08:38.335 --> 08:40.289
I've got a date with a bail bondsman.

08:40.875 --> 08:43.421
And you and Summer have a wonderful New Year's Eve.

08:43.505 --> 08:45.740
And... be safe.

08:46.095 --> 08:49.223
- Hey.
- Hey. You be safe, too, in Vegas, will ya?

08:49.255 --> 08:49.822
Yeah.

08:49.827 --> 08:52.923
The sandwiches are ready. Good to go.
And if I do say so myself, they're great.

08:52.925 --> 08:53.791
Thank you, Sandy.

08:53.795 --> 08:55.843
The only thing you have to keep in mind--

08:55.936 --> 08:57.071
make it personal.

08:57.077 --> 08:59.503
I think I just got the purr-fect idea.

08:59.535 --> 09:00.532
Good man.

09:02.296 --> 09:03.411
What was that about?

09:03.416 --> 09:05.670
Oh, nothing-just Summer and I coming with yo to Vegas.

09:05.678 --> 09:06.152
What?!

09:06.157 --> 09:07.720
You may want to make some more sandwiches.

09:07.727 --> 09:09.421
I'm going to go upstairs and pack.

09:17.117 --> 09:18.153
You're late.

09:18.155 --> 09:20.343
Yeah. I've been looking for my book.

09:21.585 --> 09:22.783
What book?

09:22.905 --> 09:25.283
The one with everyone's names, phone numbers.

09:27.077 --> 09:30.673
I had it when I was talking to you.
I put it down for a sec, it was gone.

09:31.036 --> 09:32.662
This has got to be a sign.

09:33.178 --> 09:33.980
What are you talking about?

09:33.986 --> 09:36.891
Your father tried to saddle me
with an accountant today.

09:36.937 --> 09:39.541
What if he's finding out we've turned
his investment into a horehouse?

09:39.545 --> 09:41.962
Or if Kirsten finds out?
No, we need to shut is down now.

09:41.968 --> 09:45.810
Then... let's just do to, all right?
We both need the money.

09:46.455 --> 09:47.560
We can manage without.

09:47.566 --> 09:49.062
What if Neil sells your house?

09:49.076 --> 09:50.522
Where you going to live?

09:50.905 --> 09:53.532
We're going to make 40 ground each.

09:53.877 --> 09:59.153
Now, you want to close down shop
after that, cool, but let's do tonight. Come on.

10:01.316 --> 10:02.591
We'll burn everything tomorrow.

10:02.595 --> 10:04.042
I'll light the match myself.

10:12.697 --> 10:14.071
Frank, Frank, Frank.

10:14.076 --> 10:18.433
- Damn, damn, double damn. Good to see you.
- Good to see you. Come on in. Have a seat.

10:18.465 --> 10:20.413
- Can I fix you a drink?
- No, I'm fine.

10:21.248 --> 10:24.342
So, cowboy, what the hell you
doing in these neck of the woods?

10:24.756 --> 10:28.583
Well, you... you once said,
if I ever needed a job...

10:30.847 --> 10:33.483
Serious? Now, don't be jerking the Bullit around.

10:33.518 --> 10:34.362
I'm serious.

10:34.365 --> 10:35.801
Well, now, that's a good thing.

10:35.806 --> 10:38.900
And I happen to have a couple
of places I could use you pronto.

10:38.906 --> 10:41.553
But, knowing you, you've already
picked something out.

10:42.038 --> 10:45.833
You're not going to believe this,
but I saw you invested in a dating service.

10:46.856 --> 10:49.141
You're kidding, right?
A man of your talents?

10:49.176 --> 10:50.640
I think there's a future in it.

10:50.648 --> 10:54.941
Yeah, but the tricky thing there is,
my girlfriend, Julie-- she's kind of running that.

10:55.365 --> 10:56.611
- Really?
- I know what you're thinking,

10:56.627 --> 11:00.773
but it's not like that barmaid in Daytona.
Now, that one, she was a con artist.

11:00.808 --> 11:02.680
- And Julie's legit?
- Absolutely.

11:02.726 --> 11:07.370
I mean, Julie's problem is not thievery.
It's pride. She wants to do everything herself,

11:07.417 --> 11:09.001
and I get no chance to see her.

11:09.205 --> 11:11.143
Oh, wait. Bullit.

11:11.877 --> 11:15.412
Oh, right. The dress shop.
Okay. On the way.

11:16.185 --> 11:17.382
Sorry. I got to go.

11:17.957 --> 11:19.721
Well, it was good to see you.

11:19.758 --> 11:21.240
You're going to love Newport.

11:21.526 --> 11:22.740
I'm sure I will.

11:23.095 --> 11:26.073
Oh, and if Julie ever gets
less proud, you let me know.

11:26.116 --> 11:29.203
-  I'd love to help out.
- I'll do that. Happy New Year, partner.

11:29.208 --> 11:31.120
- Same to you.
- See you later.

11:31.165 --> 11:32.162
Right.

11:47.846 --> 11:51.330
Taylor, you look terrible.
What's the matter?

11:52.565 --> 11:54.011
Okay, can you keep a secret?

11:54.348 --> 11:57.773
But I mean a big secret.
Like, a really big secret.

11:57.807 --> 11:58.811
Yeah.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.590
I think you might be pregnant.

12:06.038 --> 12:07.820
Um... okay.

12:08.146 --> 12:10.943
First of all, if I were pregnant,
that would be my secret.

12:10.947 --> 12:13.321
And second of all,
I'm late, not pregnant.

12:13.368 --> 12:14.812
And how did you know that?

12:15.495 --> 12:18.681
Okay, when I went to visit you in Providence,
I remember that you had your period,

12:18.685 --> 12:21.993
which means you should have had it again a week and a half ago.

12:21.107 --> 12:24.901
But the box of tampons that you bought
two weeks ago hasn't even been opened.

12:25.068 --> 12:27.163
Summer, have you had unsafe sex?

12:28.225 --> 12:30.673
Well, there was that time where Seth visited...

12:30.717 --> 12:31.713
Summer...

12:31.788 --> 12:34.720
I didn't want the pharmaceutical companies
playing slumlord with my eggs.

12:34.728 --> 12:36.320
Well, what about condoms?

12:36.488 --> 12:37.592
Latex smells funny.

12:37.598 --> 12:38.983
- So do diapers.
- Taylor!

12:38.985 --> 12:42.840
What?  Don't pretend you're not worried about this,
because you've been preoccupied all day.

12:42.846 --> 12:44.043
I am not pregnant.

12:44.496 --> 12:46.982
Hmm. Well, prove it.

12:47.967 --> 12:48.813
Get that away from me.

12:48.905 --> 12:50.011
Hey, you decent?

12:50.775 --> 12:52.203
Seth, actually,

12:52.248 --> 12:54.012
Summer and I were just
having a little girl time,

12:54.017 --> 12:56.200
- so if you could just come back in 15...
- It's so good to see you!

12:56.207 --> 13:00.960
Hey, wow! Look at all this affection,
and I haven't even told you my surprise yet.

13:01.448 --> 13:04.680
Though, to be fair, it's really
more of Ryan's surprise.

13:04.685 --> 13:07.651
- Seth.
- But, yes, the four of us are going to Las Vegas.

13:07.695 --> 13:09.143
Ryan is in the car, waiting.

13:09.147 --> 13:10.503
Ryan's taking me to Vegas?

13:10.506 --> 13:13.720
And I'm taking you,
Mrs. What-Are-Our-Plans-For-New Year's.

13:13.755 --> 13:15.523
Now, why don't you to get packed
so we can get on the road.

13:15.527 --> 13:18.280
Actually, Summer and I just need to dash
into the bathroom really quick and...

13:18.287 --> 13:20.683
That is a great idea.
That is the best idea ever!

13:21.417 --> 13:22.820
Why don't you help me pick out what to bring?

13:22.828 --> 13:24.023
- Okay.
- Okay.

13:24.678 --> 13:29.890
Okay, well, I'm just going to pack
this toothpaste because we might want it in Vegas.

13:45.016 --> 13:47.230
Hey, Ryan, can we stop soon?
Summer and I have to pee.

13:47.238 --> 13:50.162
Oh, yeah? Sure. You know what?
Next chance we get, I'll get some gas.

13:50.176 --> 13:51.172
Great.

13:55.436 --> 13:58.702
Summer, I think, when we stop,
we should try out our new toothpaste.

13:58.708 --> 13:59.700
Um...

13:59.737 --> 14:01.201
Breath's a little stale.

14:08.625 --> 14:10.590
Ryan, are you ready for a sandwich?

14:12.058 --> 14:15.901
Hmm? Listen, I know we're crashing,

14:16.565 --> 14:18.111
but I promise you,
soon as we get to Vegas,

14:18.117 --> 14:22.101
I'm going to buy you the best room
Sandy Cohen's money can buy.

14:22.147 --> 14:24.441
You're rescuing me,
and I want to pay you back.

14:25.805 --> 14:27.001
Yeah, all right.

14:29.297 --> 14:30.493
Hey, Seth,

14:30.627 --> 14:32.321
hypothetically speaking,

14:32.355 --> 14:34.691
if I was your girlfriend,
and I had health issues,

14:34.697 --> 14:36.093
would you want to know about them?

14:36.095 --> 14:37.780
Um... I don't know.
What kind of health issues?

14:37.786 --> 14:39.232
Diarrhea of the mouth.

14:39.255 --> 14:43.282
Can we just, like, stop talking and turn
the music up and just drive, please?

14:47.436 --> 14:50.730
Summer, there is something in your hair.
Let me get it out for you.

14:52.015 --> 14:52.903
What are you doing?

14:52.905 --> 14:54.401
I think you need to tell Seth.

14:55.535 --> 14:56.992
No. I don't think he could handle it.

14:56.998 --> 14:58.972
- How do you know?
- Aw, crap!

15:00.135 --> 15:02.933
Forgot my toothbrush.
I'm going to have to use my finger.

15:03.185 --> 15:04.553
See? He's a child.

15:04.587 --> 15:06.541
What kind of toothbrush did you get ?

15:06.585 --> 15:07.710
- Seth!
- Don't...!

15:07.718 --> 15:08.712
Oh.

15:10.087 --> 15:10.660
Is this...?

15:10.676 --> 15:12.122
Mine! My toothpaste.

15:12.675 --> 15:13.493
What's going on?

15:13.497 --> 15:15.613
Nothing. It's just this is...

15:16.227 --> 15:18.600
extra whitening,
and Seth needs tartar control.

15:19.017 --> 15:20.013
Badly.

15:29.558 --> 15:30.751
Thank you.

15:38.618 --> 15:39.610
Mom?

15:41.416 --> 15:43.202
Okay, the coast is clear, dude.

15:43.487 --> 15:45.232
Yeah. She's probably still at work.

15:46.037 --> 15:49.891
You sure we did the right thing but not buying
that little number with rhinestones?

15:49.898 --> 15:53.472
You asked me for my help to pick out
a dress for my mother, so trust me.

15:53.516 --> 15:58.262
Well, I just want to make sure she feels like
a million dollars at my party tonight, that's all.

15:58.377 --> 16:00.680
That's assuming she finishes work on time.

16:00.728 --> 16:02.892
I offered to get someone in there
to help the woman out.

16:02.895 --> 16:04.450
She flat out refused me.

16:05.266 --> 16:06.660
You really like her, don't you?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.943
Oh, yeah, peanut.
She's under my skin.

16:09.355 --> 16:11.040
The whole time I was in Riyadh,

16:11.358 --> 16:13.680
didn't once try to peek under a girl's burkha.

16:14.166 --> 16:16.161
So, uh... what you got going on tonight?

16:16.207 --> 16:20.141
Well, I'm supposed to talk to my dad,
but his boat's out of cell phone range.

16:20.717 --> 16:22.800
So, whatever. It's no big.

16:22.847 --> 16:25.743
Well, dang, girl, if you're free,
why not come to my party?

16:25.885 --> 16:26.791
Because I'm 40?

16:26.797 --> 16:30.850
No, because it's New Year's Eve,
and I got not one prince, but two coming.

16:30.887 --> 16:32.732
- William and Harry?
- Mm-mm--

16:33.595 --> 16:35.742
Samir and Abbas. Saudis.

16:35.776 --> 16:39.392
About your age, and not a bad catch,
if you don't mind raisins in your chicken.

16:39.396 --> 16:40.840
You like two-steppin'?

16:41.955 --> 16:44.530
It's a dance we do in Texas--
I can show you tonight if you'd like.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.230
You can hold your breath for that.

16:48.786 --> 16:50.363
All  right. Well, I appreciate your help.

16:50.367 --> 16:51.563
You take care now.

16:53.267 --> 16:54.463
Ignore her.

16:55.928 --> 16:56.530
Come again?

16:56.548 --> 16:58.752
She refused your help,
so ignore her.

16:59.405 --> 17:00.810
It's what I always do.

17:03.827 --> 17:05.021
Here you go.

17:05.387 --> 17:06.121
What's this for?

17:06.137 --> 17:08.353
In case you change your mind,
come to the party,

17:08.356 --> 17:12.531
you might want to buy a dress
or a lollipop or something.

17:16.417 --> 17:17.609
Yo, Frank.

17:17.836 --> 17:19.030
Yeah, Bullit.

17:19.744 --> 17:21.292
What's going on this afternoon?

17:33.495 --> 17:34.692
It's up to you.

17:36.355 --> 17:37.423
You'll be there when I take it?

17:37.428 --> 17:38.622
Of course.

17:39.725 --> 17:40.723
Let's go.

17:50.505 --> 17:52.763
Hey, uh...
is everything all right?

17:53.365 --> 17:55.862
You, uh... were acting kind of strange in the car.

17:57.197 --> 17:59.541
Okay, I just wanted to, uh,
you know, apologize.

17:59.678 --> 18:01.613
I know this trip to Vegas
is supposed to be us,

18:01.615 --> 18:05.631
but Seth kind of hijacked it to get out
of the doghouse, so what are you going to do?

18:05.647 --> 18:06.452
Yeah, I know.

18:06.457 --> 18:09.583
Uh... anyway, you know, he, uh...
he's getting us a room.

18:09.967 --> 18:11.412
So at least we'll be alone.

18:12.475 --> 18:16.352
Yeah. Uh... I don't think
that we should do that.

18:17.395 --> 18:18.503
In fact, I know that we shouldn't.

18:18.518 --> 18:20.511
Uh... What...
what are you talking about?

18:21.145 --> 18:23.643
Obviously, we both thought
that we were going to...

18:23.957 --> 18:27.201
It's Vegas, and there's lingerie,
and it would be great, trust me,

18:27.368 --> 18:31.503
but I just want our first time to be special,
and tonight is just not the night.

18:32.465 --> 18:34.100
Okay? Sorry. I got to go.

18:44.035 --> 18:45.233
I have a question.

18:46.056 --> 18:47.650
And let's pretend I wasn't eavesdropping.

18:47.658 --> 18:51.553
Are you absolutely positive that
you haven't had sex yet with Taylor?

18:52.095 --> 18:53.292
Not even, like a,

18:53.798 --> 18:55.921
"I feel guilty about this
because you're kind of wasted,

18:55.927 --> 18:57.670
but how did that happen?" mistake?

18:58.748 --> 19:00.112
Okay, I'll take that as a no.

19:00.116 --> 19:01.620
Hey, look at that.

19:01.667 --> 19:05.813
It's a green alien. It's crazy. Well,
these windows aren't going to wash themselves.

19:06.976 --> 19:07.941
Seth, what's going on?

19:07.945 --> 19:10.781
Okay, "Remove the test stick
from the foiwrapper."

19:10.818 --> 19:12.010
Did that already.

19:12.365 --> 19:16.681
"Position the stick with the test windows
facing away from the urine stream,

19:16.716 --> 19:20.713
and place the absorbent tip
under the stream of urine."

19:21.716 --> 19:23.160
Stream of urine, Summer.

19:25.048 --> 19:26.041
Uh...

19:32.717 --> 19:33.913
You need something?

19:34.506 --> 19:36.012
Oh, no. Thank you.

19:36.636 --> 19:37.240
Who is it?

19:37.247 --> 19:38.833
A slutty alien. Did you pee?

19:40.866 --> 19:41.551
I'll go outside.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.000
Wait, wait. Don't leave me.

19:52.826 --> 19:54.021
May I help you?

19:54.225 --> 19:55.422
You must be Julie.

19:56.888 --> 19:58.082
And you are...?

20:01.698 --> 20:02.960
I told you she was hot.

20:02.967 --> 20:04.472
Julie, meet my buddy Frank.

20:04.918 --> 20:06.663
He's gonna put your books in order.

20:09.396 --> 20:10.360
Didn't I say no to this?

20:10.368 --> 20:13.150
Oh, yes, you did, but a little birdie
told me to ignore you,

20:13.158 --> 20:14.353
so that's what I'm doing.

20:14.356 --> 20:17.182
- Gordon...
- Is no longer willing to negotiate.

20:17.225 --> 20:18.973
Now, let's let Frank do his thing.

20:19.358 --> 20:20.280
Meantime,

20:20.285 --> 20:25.743
let's get you out of that Pilgrim outfit and
into a ball gown, which I happen to have bought you.

20:26.168 --> 20:29.592
And, Frank, if you get finished by midnight,
you come play with us, you hear?

20:29.595 --> 20:30.593
I will.

20:30.966 --> 20:32.160
Oh, Julie.

20:33.605 --> 20:35.053
It was nice meeting you.

20:37.055 --> 20:38.621
Nice meeting you, too, Frank.

20:39.005 --> 20:40.203
Come on, sweetie.

20:46.826 --> 20:48.562
Why are the girls acting so strange?

20:48.566 --> 20:51.530
- Dude, I don't, you know...
- 12 more seconds. 11 more seconds.

20:51.536 --> 20:53.210
- What if there wasn't engh pee?
- Ten seconds.

20:53.216 --> 20:54.410
Here, let's switch.

20:55.105 --> 20:57.051
- How many bars am I looking for?
- Two. Two bars.

20:57.055 --> 20:58.853
Oh, my God, four more seconds.
Oh, my God, I can't look.

20:58.857 --> 21:00.561
- Three more seconds. two more seconds...
- Oh, my god.

21:00.565 --> 21:02.963
- one more second.
- Okay, I can't do it. Just don't look at it,

21:02.968 --> 21:06.321
- I can't breathe...
- Okay, okay... Sit down. Sit down, sit down.

21:07.317 --> 21:10.411
- I can't breathe.
- Here, breathe, breathe. Breathe into this.

21:10.437 --> 21:11.883
Breathe deep breaths.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.282
Look, Summer, I'm not gonna
make you do anything.

21:14.285 --> 21:15.730
It's totally your decision.

21:16.006 --> 21:18.430
But whatever you do,
it doesn't change the truth,

21:18.476 --> 21:20.911
and-and in a few hours,
it's gonna be the new year.

21:20.915 --> 21:24.881
Do you want to start that year as an adult,
with your eyes wide open, or,

21:25.346 --> 21:26.792
with your head in the sand?

21:28.467 --> 21:29.660
Give it to me.

21:31.166 --> 21:31.821
Oh, my God.

21:31.825 --> 21:33.063
- What?
- It's gone.

21:33.095 --> 21:34.090
What?!

21:34.737 --> 21:35.640
I don't believe it.

21:35.646 --> 21:36.873
Well, do you think she cheated on you?

21:36.877 --> 21:39.391
No. I mean, I-I can't believe
she didn't tell me.

21:39.908 --> 21:42.022
Well, I'll wash the car
if you want to go smash something.

21:42.026 --> 21:43.520
Like maybe that big green bug.

21:44.908 --> 21:45.900
Hey!

21:46.067 --> 21:47.451
Excuse me! I...

21:49.605 --> 21:52.103
You... Follow that alien!
She stole my purse!

21:52.136 --> 21:54.153
- What?
- She just stole my purse.

21:54.195 --> 21:56.203
- What? Well...
- Get in the car!

21:56.237 --> 21:57.862
She just stole it
from underneath the bathroom.

21:57.868 --> 22:00.991
- Seth, hurry up!
- She's getting... She's right there! Go!

22:01.516 --> 22:03.002
Ryan, go! Go!

22:03.446 --> 22:04.440
Geez!

22:10.936 --> 22:13.773
Can't we just buy you a new purse
and cancel your credit cards?

22:13.775 --> 22:15.473
- No, we need that purse.
- Why?

22:15.927 --> 22:18.570
- Because...
- Of the pills that I have in there.

22:18.985 --> 22:21.172
For the allergy I have
but never told you guys about.

22:21.177 --> 22:22.611
It's just... nothing serious.

22:22.615 --> 22:24.662
And she needs to take
the pills before midnight.

22:24.667 --> 22:25.663
Right.

22:26.108 --> 22:27.840
And since we are
in the middle of the desert,

22:27.847 --> 22:31.483
and nowhere near a pharmacy,
it has to be the pills in that purse.

22:31.865 --> 22:32.860
Sorry.

22:35.388 --> 22:38.680
- You're being awfully quiet.
- There's a lot of that going around.

22:43.928 --> 22:45.370
Hey, I see brake lights.

22:45.586 --> 22:46.720
What is this place?

22:46.727 --> 22:48.271
Look like some kind of a party.

23:00.035 --> 23:01.520
Did anyone get a good look at her face?

23:01.528 --> 23:04.420
She's an alien-- it's not
an easy thing to lose in a crowd.

23:11.616 --> 23:14.000
- I don't believe it.
- Everyone is an alien.

23:14.876 --> 23:16.210
Hey, we're gonna go this way.

23:16.216 --> 23:17.660
Okay, we'll go this way.

23:18.895 --> 23:20.000
But...

23:20.415 --> 23:22.431
Come on. I promised you some alone time.

23:44.485 --> 23:45.083
Hey.

23:45.087 --> 23:46.511
Mm... hey.

23:47.158 --> 23:48.903
Spencer, let me ask you a question.

23:49.135 --> 23:51.533
When you paired these ladies
up with their dates,

23:51.558 --> 23:53.371
did you know they were coming to this party?

23:53.375 --> 23:56.420
You don't think Kirsten's
gonna smell something fishy, do you?

23:56.455 --> 24:00.350
No, no. I think we're taking the fish
and slapping her in the face with it.

24:00.397 --> 24:02.430
She knows these women are our clients.

24:02.466 --> 24:04.070
Maybe she won't notice--
isn't she an alcoholic?

24:04.075 --> 24:05.511
Recovering, unfortunately.

24:05.525 --> 24:07.800
So did you find anything out about Frank?

24:08.357 --> 24:09.231
Not a lot.

24:09.237 --> 24:11.250
He's a friend of my dad's.
I'm not sure where they met.

24:11.257 --> 24:14.741
He took series seven a month ago,
but before that, nothing.

24:14.786 --> 24:16.111
Doesn't exist.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.162
So what do you think?

24:18.588 --> 24:20.032
Well, I'm thinking maybe...

24:20.217 --> 24:21.853
CIA or Special Ops?

24:21.885 --> 24:24.033
No, Deep Throat, I mean,
what do you think we should do?

24:24.038 --> 24:26.081
Does he seem like someone we can bribe?

24:26.118 --> 24:28.660
Eh, I wouldn't bank on it--
my dad's big on loyalty.

24:29.008 --> 24:30.803
Speaking of... where is he anyway?

24:31.347 --> 24:34.261
He's over there introducing
Kaitlin to some Saudi princes.

24:34.296 --> 24:36.443
This is Samir--
and I call him Sam.

24:36.797 --> 24:39.433
And this is Abbas--
and I call him Boss.

24:40.115 --> 24:42.201
You are, uh,
Kait... Kaitland?

24:42.237 --> 24:42.910
Kaitlin.

24:42.915 --> 24:44.303
- Kaitlin.
- Kaitlin.

24:44.307 --> 24:46.281
- Kaitland.
- Okay, Kaitland.

24:58.025 --> 25:00.793
He says there's no coat-check,
and there's no one really in charge.

25:00.806 --> 25:05.403
Oh, then he invited me to party on his asteroid,
which I think means his trailer.

25:05.915 --> 25:08.192
Maybe we should just find Seth
and Summer and make sure they're okay.

25:08.195 --> 25:11.713
Taylor, I... I know. Seth told me.

25:12.755 --> 25:13.953
Told you what?

25:14.848 --> 25:16.943
You know... it, the thing.

25:18.537 --> 25:21.763
- Okay, let me explain...
- I just wish that you told me.

25:22.078 --> 25:25.710
That's what I'm mad about, not any of
the other stuff, just that you kept it from me.

25:25.717 --> 25:27.672
Wait, wh-what other stuff?

25:27.705 --> 25:31.651
Well, you know, that you were...
sleeping with someone before we started dating.

25:31.725 --> 25:32.721
Who says?

25:33.166 --> 25:35.382
Well, the math says,
but, look, I'm not mad about that.

25:35.387 --> 25:36.901
See, I knew you felt this way.

25:36.935 --> 25:38.460
Well, I'm not... I'm not
accusing you of anything.

25:38.466 --> 25:39.262
Yes, you are.

25:39.268 --> 25:42.143
You are saying that I had
random unsafe sex with someone

25:42.178 --> 25:44.802
in between my marriage annulment
and us making out at Kaitlin's.

25:44.807 --> 25:45.871
Do you know how many days that was, Ryan?

25:45.878 --> 25:48.580
So what are you saying? You're saying you were
sleeping with someone while we were dating?

25:48.585 --> 25:51.361
- Is that what you think?
- No! But if you were,

25:51.405 --> 25:53.243
I couldn't be mad because
we were never exclusive.

25:53.248 --> 25:57.742
Right. And why would you want to be, since
you clearly think I am a big fat divorcee whore!

26:06.226 --> 26:07.420
Oh, my God.

26:07.776 --> 26:08.742
Julie.

26:08.748 --> 26:09.882
Hi. Hey.

26:09.917 --> 26:11.043
Uh, where's Sandy?

26:11.045 --> 26:12.493
Julie, what's going on?

26:12.926 --> 26:13.560
What do you mean?

26:13.565 --> 26:18.370
Well, it's just that all our clients here are on dates
with people that look like they're college students--

26:18.376 --> 26:21.160
I mean, weren't we supposed to set up
Jessica Rogers with Dr. Weston?

26:21.168 --> 26:24.452
Yeah, you know, we were, but she called
yesterday and said she met someone--

26:24.456 --> 26:25.622
that's love.

26:25.627 --> 26:26.822
Hello, Julie.

26:27.656 --> 26:29.812
Frank... uh, you're here.

26:29.815 --> 26:32.653
Uh... Frank, this is Kirsten Cohen, my partner.

26:32.685 --> 26:35.932
- This is Frank...
- Perry. Frank Perry. Nice to meet you.

26:35.968 --> 26:38.280
Nice to meet you Frank Perry. Right. Um...

26:38.315 --> 26:40.523
Bullit hired him to put our books in order,

26:40.565 --> 26:43.212
and that's what he's been doing
all night so that I could be here.

26:43.217 --> 26:43.911
Oh.

26:43.915 --> 26:45.361
Does everything add up?

26:46.777 --> 26:48.431
Yeah. Looks good.

26:49.208 --> 26:51.650
And business seems to be booming, so...

26:51.698 --> 26:53.542
if I had a drink,
I-I would toast you.

26:54.646 --> 26:56.742
Well, I'll-I'll take it anyway. Thank you.

26:57.955 --> 26:59.773
All right, ladies, as you were.

27:00.257 --> 27:02.010
Kirsten, a pleasure to meet you.

27:04.875 --> 27:07.442
Ah, Kiki, do you ever feel invincible.

27:07.888 --> 27:08.882
Why?

27:09.288 --> 27:10.732
Oh... no reason.

27:11.505 --> 27:12.953
Happy New Year, sweetie.

27:22.356 --> 27:24.530
Remind me again
why we're looking for a purse

27:24.535 --> 27:28.431
when the larger issue seems to be
Taylor thinking she has a baby inside of her?

27:28.457 --> 27:30.871
And don't give me anything
about any allergy pills,

27:30.876 --> 27:31.843
'cause I'm not buying it.

27:31.847 --> 27:34.351
Seth, we need the purse,
because the pregnancy test is in it.

27:34.357 --> 27:36.801
The test that we have already taken
and haven't looked at yet.

27:36.808 --> 27:40.992
The test that we need to see before midnight
so we can start 2007 knowing exactly where we stand.

27:40.996 --> 27:42.261
Can I interrupt you for a second?

27:42.266 --> 27:44.220
I'm remembering something
I wanted to ask you

27:44.227 --> 27:47.001
for back in the car
when I found out the test was Taylor's.

27:47.006 --> 27:48.001
What?

27:48.936 --> 27:49.931
Paw.

27:51.016 --> 27:52.012
Up top.

27:52.157 --> 27:53.810
You're asking me for a high five?

27:53.857 --> 27:56.143
Can you imagine if it was
your test we're looking for?

27:56.146 --> 27:59.740
Now, I know it seems a little bit selfish,
but I think we're entitled to celebrate,

27:59.747 --> 28:02.120
so come on, up top, hit it.

28:03.826 --> 28:04.822
Hit it.

28:05.928 --> 28:07.201
God, Seth.

28:14.257 --> 28:15.381
Oh, God.

28:16.116 --> 28:18.262
Oh, my God! It's really you!

28:18.305 --> 28:20.630
Seth Cohen! I saw you
at Comic-Con years ago.

28:20.668 --> 28:24.741
- Oh.
- I'm a huge, huge... huge Atomic County fan!

28:24.785 --> 28:26.851
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.
- Check it out, man--

28:26.865 --> 28:27.732
I'm Kid Chino!

28:27.737 --> 28:29.702
Oh, wow, that is fantastic.
Listen, I'm looking...

28:29.707 --> 28:32.051
- We got to take a picture, man.
- Oh, oh, okay.

28:32.718 --> 28:35.263
This... is the greatest night
of my life, Mr. Cohen.

28:35.887 --> 28:38.532
- Wow, thanks a lot. Hey, oh, it's the alien!
- Smile!

28:38.847 --> 28:40.413
Thanks a lot.
Thanks, man.

28:46.807 --> 28:49.210
I didn't want to embarrass you
in front of your partner,

28:49.217 --> 28:51.203
but your so-called dating service...

28:51.976 --> 28:55.020
is not exactly what Bullit
thought he was investing in, is it?

28:57.597 --> 28:58.833
Why don't you wet your lips.

28:58.838 --> 28:59.801
Your mouth looks dry.

28:59.805 --> 29:00.861
Kaitland?

29:00.896 --> 29:01.891
What?

29:02.228 --> 29:03.560
We are boring you, yes?

29:03.566 --> 29:07.832
Maybe it will be more pleasing
to you if we make... kissing to each other.

29:08.436 --> 29:10.593
Yeah, y-you guys go do that.

29:12.405 --> 29:16.432
Okay, so just what do I have
to do to keep you quiet?

29:19.637 --> 29:21.621
Suite 522 at the Four Seasons.

29:22.655 --> 29:24.253
Say... half an hour.

29:39.266 --> 29:40.462
Oh, there you are.

29:40.485 --> 29:41.682
How's your client?

29:41.965 --> 29:42.623
Darrel?

29:42.627 --> 29:45.122
Well, he's better off than
the parking meter he beheaded.

29:45.127 --> 29:47.050
I sent him to a shalter.
How has your night been?

29:47.058 --> 29:49.190
Oh, it's just... it's just odd.

29:49.226 --> 29:51.012
Julie's acting strange, and...

29:51.805 --> 29:53.173
well, we have clients here--

29:53.177 --> 29:54.903
it's just they're not with the dates
that we set them up with.

29:54.905 --> 29:56.483
So if I'm a little tense I apologize.

29:56.486 --> 29:59.723
- Come on, let's work it out on the dance flor.
- Yeah.

30:00.397 --> 30:01.953
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

30:01.986 --> 30:03.181
No, my fault.

30:03.778 --> 30:04.972
Sandy Cohen.

30:05.818 --> 30:06.820
Uh, Frank Perry.

30:06.826 --> 30:07.953
Frank works for Bullit.

30:07.967 --> 30:09.161
Oh, is that right?

30:09.476 --> 30:11.091
Yeah, the Big Baimself.

30:11.778 --> 30:13.520
Well, it was nice bumping into you.

30:14.165 --> 30:15.613
And, uh, happy New Year.

30:16.597 --> 30:17.593
You, too.

30:21.518 --> 30:22.630
Sandy, something wrong?

30:22.646 --> 30:24.793
I feel like I know that guy from somewhere.

30:25.755 --> 30:27.441
Come on. How about that dance?

30:31.818 --> 30:33.260
Hey there, Miss Columbus.

30:33.397 --> 30:34.593
How are you?

30:34.926 --> 30:36.120
Good to see you.

30:36.738 --> 30:38.332
Hey, now, enjoy yourself.

30:43.268 --> 30:45.261
Mom, aren't you gonna stay for midnight?

30:45.938 --> 30:47.961
Oh, Kaitlin, your mom has a headache.

30:47.997 --> 30:50.691
But you should stay-- have Bullit
give you a ride home.

30:51.785 --> 30:54.882
This doesn't have anything
to do with that creepy guy, does it?

30:56.628 --> 30:57.432
What creepy guy?

30:57.445 --> 30:58.960
They guy I saw you talking to.

30:59.836 --> 31:01.272
You were gonna go meet him, weren't you?

31:01.278 --> 31:02.723
This is not what you think.

31:03.685 --> 31:05.562
But, please,
you can't tell Bullit about this.

31:05.567 --> 31:07.111
Mom, he really likes you.

31:07.155 --> 31:09.663
And-and I really like him, too.
It just...

31:11.975 --> 31:13.723
You have to trust me on this, okay?

31:15.535 --> 31:16.533
Okay.

31:17.106 --> 31:18.302
Happy Year, baby.

31:21.808 --> 31:22.800
Uh, Mom?

31:27.057 --> 31:28.642
I miss Dad sometimes.

31:30.495 --> 31:31.693
I know, honey.

31:32.246 --> 31:33.741
We'll call him tomorrow, okay?

31:34.326 --> 31:35.323
Okay.

31:50.328 --> 31:51.290
Taylor!

31:51.297 --> 31:52.071
Ryan.

31:52.076 --> 31:53.143
What are you doing? Let's go.

31:53.146 --> 31:55.892
Ryan, you think I'm a whore,
I'm gonna act like a whore.

31:55.918 --> 31:58.263
I don't think you're a whore, but I definitely
don't think you should be drinking.

31:58.268 --> 32:00.642
Why, because I might be pregnant
with my whore baby?

32:00.647 --> 32:01.642
Hey!

32:01.697 --> 32:04.011
How about giving that back
before I atomize your face?

32:04.016 --> 32:06.740
- How do you just back off?
- Hey, what's going on?

32:07.318 --> 32:08.103
What are you doing?

32:08.106 --> 32:10.291
I'm trying to figure out
why mylfriend is taking pregnancy tests

32:10.298 --> 32:13.120
and I'm the last one to find out about it.
How hat possible?

32:13.128 --> 32:15.113
Because it's not hers, okay? It's mine.

32:15.496 --> 32:17.442
It's my test that is in Taylor's purse.

32:17.737 --> 32:18.321
What?

32:18.326 --> 32:22.410
Great. This re I'm not a know
if I'm pregnant before midnight.

32:22.456 --> 32:27.050
There's nothing like starting off a new near
with something like this hanging over your head.

32:29.288 --> 32:30.220
Happy New Year, Ryan.

32:30.228 --> 32:31.420
- What?
- Ryan!

32:32.887 --> 32:35.173
Dude, it's Summer's.

32:35.206 --> 32:36.652
I know. Come on. Let's go.

32:36.686 --> 32:39.392
three, two, one.

32:39.427 --> 32:40.623
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

32:49.127 --> 32:52.201
Wait a minute, summer, wait !

32:54.356 --> 32:55.752
All right, thanks.

32:57.276 --> 32:58.822
Nearest cab company's in Baker.

32:59.158 --> 33:02.950
- What do you want to do now?
- Oh, curl up into the fetal position and weep.

33:03.377 --> 33:05.551
Although, perhaps
the unborn baby metaphor...

33:05.555 --> 33:07.002
Not really appropriate.

33:07.566 --> 33:09.650
I cannot believe Summer might be pregnant.

33:09.655 --> 33:10.851
Oh, my God.

33:14.678 --> 33:16.371
Uh, Seth.

33:23.876 --> 33:27.520
Don't worry, Summer. I'm sure we'll pass
a 24-hour pharmacy at some point.

33:28.008 --> 33:30.002
The symbolism window closed at midnight.

33:30.705 --> 33:31.753
We'll do it in the morning.

33:31.755 --> 33:32.752
Okay.

33:33.626 --> 33:36.180
Taylor, I really appreciate everything
you did for me today.

33:36.187 --> 33:39.032
I really hope it didn't cause
any permanent damage with you and Ryan.

33:39.035 --> 33:42.031
Oh, don't worry about me, please.

33:44.966 --> 33:46.161
How did I get here?

33:46.896 --> 33:50.722
How did I go from being
an Ivy League Al Gore in the making

33:50.758 --> 33:52.812
to a knocked-up college dropout
with a boyfriend

33:52.818 --> 33:55.412
that forgets to pack his toothbrush
when he travels?

33:56.988 --> 33:58.430
How did this happen?

34:00.625 --> 34:01.821
You know what?

34:02.007 --> 34:03.203
It's a new year.

34:03.407 --> 34:05.003
We all get a fresh start.

34:05.407 --> 34:09.522
Okay? You and me and Seth and Ryan,
we can all be whatever we want to be.

34:10.437 --> 34:13.051
And everything negative
will be left in last year.

34:15.257 --> 34:16.101
What's my name?

34:16.105 --> 34:17.891
- Zerk-nong.
- Spell it.

34:17.928 --> 34:19.380
Z-U...

34:19.876 --> 34:20.870
"E"!

34:21.007 --> 34:24.561
Oh. Z... Z-E-R-

34:25.128 --> 34:26.663
- K-N
- Hyphen.

34:26.697 --> 34:31.692
Hyphen, N-O-N-G.

34:32.768 --> 34:34.712
It was kind of mean leaving them
in there like that, wasn't it?

34:34.717 --> 34:35.713
Yeah.

34:36.786 --> 34:37.782
Yeah.

34:38.775 --> 34:40.532
I'll call 'em, see if they're okay.

34:41.627 --> 34:44.221
I need to borrow your phone.
I left mine in my purse.

34:45.097 --> 34:47.110
- What does that spell?
- Zerk-nong.

34:47.148 --> 34:48.882
- Again.
- Zerk-nong.

34:48.926 --> 34:50.342
Good girl.

34:52.245 --> 34:53.440
Oh, my God!

34:53.937 --> 34:54.929
Run!

34:58.306 --> 35:00.023
Hey, Mr. Cohen!

35:00.405 --> 35:02.562
Hey!

35:03.108 --> 35:05.310
Hey, these alien chicks are really easy.

35:05.348 --> 35:07.562
Hey, we need an emergency evacuation.

35:07.597 --> 35:11.221
You got it. Hey, too bad we don't have
Little Miss Vixen's magic scooter.

35:11.258 --> 35:12.390
We have to go!

35:12.395 --> 35:13.841
They stole my purse!

35:18.296 --> 35:20.352
- All set?
- What?

35:21.198 --> 35:22.540
You still thinking about Frank?

35:22.557 --> 35:24.691
I can't shake the feeling that I know him.

35:24.736 --> 35:25.732
I wish you did.

35:25.738 --> 35:28.310
I'd love to know who Julie
has going through our books.

35:28.317 --> 35:30.441
She never said anything.
Nothing about where Bullit found him?

35:30.446 --> 35:32.290
Knowing Bullit, it could be anywhere:

35:32.446 --> 35:34.342
the golf course, Saudi Arabia, prison.

35:34.617 --> 35:36.061
You going to follow me home?

35:36.397 --> 35:38.450
Yeah. No, no.

35:38.486 --> 35:41.012
I'm going to swing by the homeless shelter
make sure Daryl made it there.

35:41.018 --> 35:42.962
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, I won't be long.

35:45.978 --> 35:48.330
You just say where you want us
to drop you off, Mr. Cohen.

35:48.337 --> 35:50.710
The girls and I are honored
to be helping out.

35:53.497 --> 35:56.840
Look, as scared as you are,
I'm sure Summer's ten times more scared.

35:57.286 --> 35:59.540
Translation: I need to be there for her.

35:59.587 --> 36:02.400
Exactly. And you can start
by telling her how you feel.

36:04.097 --> 36:06.293
Well, kinda depends on what's in this purse.

36:07.247 --> 36:08.242
Does it?

36:08.858 --> 36:11.143
It is going to change whether
or not you want to be with her?

36:11.148 --> 36:12.341
No, of course not.

36:13.108 --> 36:16.252
And can you imagine
ever not wanting to be with her?

36:17.157 --> 36:18.151
No.

36:19.916 --> 36:21.113
That's your answer.

36:35.336 --> 36:36.931
Hey, great party.

36:37.516 --> 36:38.712
Thank you, Peanut.

36:39.216 --> 36:40.660
How'd it go with the Saudis?

36:42.867 --> 36:46.082
Well, they want to fly me
over to Dubai for their prom,

36:46.128 --> 36:49.653
but I said there's no way I want
to wear one of those Klan outfits.

36:50.255 --> 36:51.453
I don't blame you.

36:51.746 --> 36:54.562
Have you seen your mother?
I've been, I've been looking for her.

36:54.565 --> 36:55.761
Um, she went home.

36:57.967 --> 36:59.163
She had a migraine.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.993
Dang, I wish she'd have told me.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.501
Well, I hope she's okay.

37:06.248 --> 37:10.010
So what was that dance that you were
talking to me about this afternoon?

37:10.046 --> 37:11.492
The one with the number?

37:11.868 --> 37:13.322
That'd be the Texas Two-Step.

37:14.228 --> 37:15.212
Can you show it to me?

37:15.217 --> 37:16.662
Is the Pope Catholic?

37:16.927 --> 37:18.182
Oh, come on, lucky lady.

37:18.187 --> 37:19.993
It's your night. Here we go.

37:21.498 --> 37:22.432
Ready?

37:22.437 --> 37:24.233
And it's one, two,

37:24.718 --> 37:26.602
one, two, back step.

37:26.885 --> 37:30.202
One, two, one, two,
Texas Two-Step. We got it.

37:30.246 --> 37:32.060
- And you're turning.
- I'm turning?

37:32.108 --> 37:34.051
You're turning. Come on. Turn this way.

37:35.206 --> 37:37.110
That a girl. Whoa!

37:38.665 --> 37:39.860
I nearly lost you.

37:40.936 --> 37:42.440
We got it. Got it, got it.

37:51.767 --> 37:54.813
If you're here for sex, there's,
like, five guys ahead of you.

37:56.136 --> 38:00.052
Okay, look, I'm sorry
if I jumped to conclusions tonight.

38:00.507 --> 38:03.133
But you can't be paranoid either
about being divorced or any of it.

38:03.146 --> 38:04.692
It doesn't mean anything to me.

38:06.225 --> 38:07.523
So you don't think I'm a whore?

38:07.527 --> 38:10.483
No. No, of course not.

38:10.528 --> 38:12.213
Good, 'cause I'm not.

38:14.218 --> 38:17.542
Unless, of course,
you want me to be.

38:19.105 --> 38:20.823
- Is that my negligee?
- Mm-hmm.

38:20.858 --> 38:22.521
- Well, I want that back.
- Come on.

38:22.525 --> 38:23.791
Before I change my mind.

38:23.798 --> 38:26.841
- All right, but just to be clear...
- Everything but.

38:39.858 --> 38:42.450
Staring at that bunny thinking
of a baby, aren't you?

38:43.785 --> 38:45.571
I'm sorry I abandoned you in the desert.

38:45.578 --> 38:48.162
I deserved it.
And it worked out kind of well, too.

38:48.208 --> 38:50.750
I found something
that I thought might interest you.

38:51.168 --> 38:51.972
Oh, my God.

38:51.977 --> 38:53.672
But I want to say something first.

38:54.466 --> 38:56.220
When I found out it was your pregnancy test,

38:56.238 --> 38:59.432
I totally freaked out and I thought
"This will change everything,"

38:59.436 --> 39:03.502
but then Ryan asked me if I could imagine a time
when I'd ever not want to be with you,

39:03.508 --> 39:05.352
and I realized that the answer is no.

39:07.187 --> 39:08.471
I'm totally pregnant, aren't I?

39:08.477 --> 39:09.671
I don't know.

39:11.078 --> 39:12.671
What do you mean you don't know?

39:15.578 --> 39:17.562
Is that going to, like,
squirt invisible ink or something?

39:17.568 --> 39:19.523
No, but it will make you engaged to me.

39:21.037 --> 39:23.183
What? Are you insane?

39:23.758 --> 39:25.560
Possibly, but I'm certain of this.

39:26.837 --> 39:29.053
- No, Cohen, we can't.
- Sure, we can. We're both adults,

39:29.056 --> 39:31.710
we don't share DNA.
You just have to want to.

39:31.755 --> 39:32.953
- But...
- I do.

39:33.986 --> 39:35.512
Don't you think we should look at the test first?

39:35.517 --> 39:38.913
And have you wonder for the rest of your life
if I proposed to you because you're pregnant?

39:38.918 --> 39:42.861
I'm doing this because I love you,
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

39:44.168 --> 39:45.831
You know, once you do this,
you can't take it back?

39:45.837 --> 39:46.833
I know.

39:47.936 --> 39:49.581
Summer Roberts,
will you marry me?

39:55.345 --> 39:57.661
Yes, I'll marry you.

40:00.116 --> 40:01.312
All right.

40:05.128 --> 40:07.850
Okay, so should we look at the test now?

40:08.297 --> 40:12.773
Sure. Let's see what's in store
for the future Mr. and Mrs. Seth Cohen.

40:18.888 --> 40:20.330
How many bars is that?

40:20.705 --> 40:22.153
One. What's that mean?

40:22.367 --> 40:25.242
One means I'm not pregnant.

40:29.748 --> 40:32.240
I'm not pregnant.
Is it inappropriate to celebrate?

40:33.157 --> 40:34.710
No, please, please.

40:39.377 --> 40:41.262
Saves us from having
to have a shotgun wedding.

40:41.278 --> 40:43.372
Now we can just have a normal one instead.

40:44.987 --> 40:48.833
Yeah. You and me and our normal wedding.

40:54.758 --> 40:56.203
Should we hug again?

40:56.387 --> 40:57.383
Okay.

41:34.798 --> 41:35.961
Have a seat.

41:35.965 --> 41:37.953
I'm not trading sex for silence, Frank.

41:38.396 --> 41:40.571
I may be a madam, but I'm not a whore.

41:40.605 --> 41:44.422
Good to know, but
that's not why I brought you here.

41:50.637 --> 41:52.083
- It's not?
- Sit down.

42:02.347 --> 42:03.790
So, why did you bring me here?

42:03.798 --> 42:06.562
- For information.
- Information about what?

42:07.147 --> 42:08.591
About the Cohen family.

42:08.858 --> 42:09.852
Why?

42:12.678 --> 42:14.532
Because I'm not who I say I am.

42:15.408 --> 42:16.372
Breaking and entering.

42:16.375 --> 42:18.611
Drunk and disortderly conduct.

42:19.365 --> 42:20.922
DUI.

42:20.955 --> 42:22.751
Domestic dispute.

42:22.758 --> 42:24.022
And who are you?

42:28.997 --> 42:30.523
I'm Ryan's father.
