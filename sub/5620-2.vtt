WEBVTT

00:01.000 --> 00:03.208
So I took that baby and I ran.

00:03.291 --> 00:05.041
I ran like the wind
to that hospital,

00:05.125 --> 00:06.750
must've been five or six miles,

00:06.834 --> 00:09.458
and... when I got there,
I handed her to the doctor

00:09.542 --> 00:11.041
just in the nick of time.

00:11.125 --> 00:12.875
Or else she
wouldn't have made it?

00:12.959 --> 00:16.166
Let's just be glad
we didn't have to find out.

00:16.250 --> 00:19.000
And this is the daughter of
the son you didn't know you had?

00:19.083 --> 00:20.875
Yeah, that part's not important.

00:20.959 --> 00:22.875
So that makes you a grandfather?

00:22.959 --> 00:26.667
Does it? I don't really let
labels define me. (chuckles)

00:26.750 --> 00:28.041
That's an amazing story.

00:28.125 --> 00:29.834
(chuckles)

00:29.917 --> 00:31.333
Mm.

00:31.417 --> 00:32.959
♪ ♪

00:35.000 --> 00:37.875
Mmm. It's crazy, all these years

00:37.959 --> 00:39.875
your son never knew his father.

00:39.959 --> 00:42.208
I mean, it's basically
exactly my story.

00:42.291 --> 00:44.834
I wish I knew who my father was.

00:44.917 --> 00:46.000
He's out there somewhere.

00:46.083 --> 00:48.709
Mmm, mmm...

00:48.792 --> 00:50.959
You know anything
about your father?

00:51.041 --> 00:53.709
No. He was just some guy
who slept around a lot.

00:53.792 --> 00:54.709
Oh.

00:54.792 --> 00:57.625
Oh, I love your place.

00:59.041 --> 01:00.166
JIMMY:
So...

01:00.250 --> 01:02.834
where were you born?

01:02.917 --> 01:05.208
Right here, baby.

01:05.291 --> 01:07.083
That's very cool.

01:07.166 --> 01:09.166
So, your mom,
what was her story...

01:09.250 --> 01:10.542
back in the day?

01:10.625 --> 01:12.291
I think she was
a bartender.

01:12.375 --> 01:13.959
Ah.

01:14.041 --> 01:17.250
You know what, um, what bar
she worked at, by any chance?

01:18.792 --> 01:20.792
Why are we still
talking about my mom?

01:20.875 --> 01:22.166
It's kind of
killing the vibe.

01:22.250 --> 01:25.208
I don't mean
to kill the vibe.

01:25.291 --> 01:28.041
I just... thought
it'd be extra romantic

01:28.125 --> 01:30.250
if... I knew for sure

01:30.333 --> 01:32.917
that... you aren't
my daughter.

01:33.000 --> 01:34.417
What?

01:34.500 --> 01:35.875
I just found out that

01:35.959 --> 01:37.709
I have a son
that I didn't know about,

01:37.792 --> 01:40.041
and it's... you know, it's just
sort of in my head now.

01:40.125 --> 01:42.041
I mean, what if
there are others out there?

01:42.125 --> 01:44.208
I slept with a lot of bartenders
in the late '80s.

01:44.291 --> 01:45.625
I mean, there was
this movie called<i> Cocktail </i>

01:45.709 --> 01:47.208
that came out,
and for some reason

01:47.291 --> 01:49.041
it just made me extremely horny.

01:49.125 --> 01:50.458
Do you have a picture
of your mother?

01:50.542 --> 01:51.709
'Cause... No, you know what?

01:51.792 --> 01:53.041
No, that wouldn't
help at all.

01:53.125 --> 01:54.500
Send her my picture.

01:54.583 --> 01:56.291
No, I'm not sending my mom
your picture,

01:56.375 --> 01:58.208
and I'm not calling her
to find out what bar

01:58.291 --> 02:00.041
in Toronto she worked at
when I was conceived.

02:00.125 --> 02:02.041
Oh. Well...

02:02.125 --> 02:03.959
I've never been to Toronto.

02:04.041 --> 02:05.208
Problem solved.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.625
Good news.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.125
I'm not your father.

02:08.208 --> 02:10.250
Where were we?

02:10.333 --> 02:12.542
I'll just call you a cab, huh?

02:18.208 --> 02:19.875
Hey, kid. All right.

02:19.959 --> 02:21.083
(mumbles)

02:21.166 --> 02:22.709
Nice to see you. Frank.

02:24.208 --> 02:26.667
Hey, boss, you are
looking good tonight.

02:26.750 --> 02:29.458
Thanks, Ravi.

02:29.542 --> 02:30.875
ANNELISE:
Hey, boss.

02:30.959 --> 02:33.041
Looking good.
Hair's on point.

02:33.125 --> 02:35.333
What the hell's going on?

02:35.417 --> 02:37.000
'Cause you never compliment me
unless you want something.

02:37.083 --> 02:38.625
Hey, Jimmy?

02:38.709 --> 02:41.041
which you know is my weakness.
I mean...
Jimmy? Jimmy?

02:41.125 --> 02:42.750
...why don't you try a little
subtlety out? What, Ravi?

02:42.834 --> 02:44.041
No, I just wanted to reiterate

02:44.125 --> 02:45.333
that you're looking
good tonight.

02:45.417 --> 02:48.083
I know what's going on
with you two.

02:48.166 --> 02:50.709
You two want to be my plus one
for Diddy's White Party

02:50.792 --> 02:52.208
this Saturday,
so you're buttering me up.

02:52.291 --> 02:54.333
Let me tell you something.
I don't play that game.

02:54.417 --> 02:57.041
I play this game. Both of you
have to write a song about me.

02:57.125 --> 02:58.709
The better song gets you
into the party with me.

02:58.792 --> 03:00.208
I'm not writing a
song about you.

03:00.291 --> 03:01.792
♪ Funny thing about wishes ♪

03:01.875 --> 03:04.959
♪ Is sometimes they come true ♪

03:05.041 --> 03:08.917
♪ Now, Jimmy,
here's my wish for you. ♪

03:09.000 --> 03:11.208
And we have a winner!

03:11.291 --> 03:12.917
Annelise, you're in.

03:13.000 --> 03:14.959
Wait. What? Why?

03:15.041 --> 03:17.542
Oh, hey, you need to stop by
table 12 before they go.

03:17.625 --> 03:18.834
Ugh! Why?

03:18.917 --> 03:20.208
Because it's your family,

03:20.291 --> 03:22.000
and you invited them,
but you barely said

03:22.083 --> 03:23.333
so much as "hello"
the entire night.

03:23.417 --> 03:26.208
Right, my family. I forgot

03:26.291 --> 03:28.208
I have one of those now.

03:28.291 --> 03:29.875
How great is this?

03:29.959 --> 03:32.250
You know, our first
family dinner with my dad.

03:32.333 --> 03:35.709
Well, there's a lot of dinner,
not a lot of dad.

03:35.792 --> 03:37.250
He's around.

03:37.333 --> 03:38.625
You know, he showed us
to our table.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.208
He sent the crumb guy over.

03:40.291 --> 03:41.834
We saw him tell that joke.

03:41.917 --> 03:43.583
Couldn't hear it.
<i>Looked </i>hilarious.

03:43.667 --> 03:45.291
And besides,

03:45.375 --> 03:47.458
how often do my mama
and my baby mama

03:47.542 --> 03:48.709
get to have dinner together?

03:48.792 --> 03:52.125
Shell-fie! (laughs)

03:52.208 --> 03:55.041
All right, hashtag
wordplay, hashtag Jimmy's,

03:55.125 --> 03:56.917
hashtag-- oh--
strong-not-skinny.

03:57.000 --> 03:58.667
What's your user name?
I'll tag you.

03:58.750 --> 04:00.291
It's "I'm a 46-year-old woman."

04:00.375 --> 04:03.291
Hey! So good
to see you all again!

04:03.375 --> 04:04.583
It's great to be here.

04:04.667 --> 04:06.583
I only came because
Gerald wanted me to.

04:06.667 --> 04:07.959
Thank you for making that clear.

04:08.041 --> 04:09.917
And because I assume
the food is free.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.875
We'll see. (laughs)

04:15.166 --> 04:16.375
(sighs)

04:16.458 --> 04:18.375
Well, it was great
to see you all.

04:18.458 --> 04:19.959
I'm gonna go put out some fires.

04:20.041 --> 04:21.375
It's-it's crazy tonight.

04:21.458 --> 04:22.750
Oh, no, it's not.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.375
It's actually
really smooth.

04:24.458 --> 04:26.166
(whispering)
Stop talking?

04:26.250 --> 04:27.959
Okay. (laughs)
Oh.

04:28.041 --> 04:29.375
All right.

04:29.458 --> 04:30.959
Good-bye, pork chop.

04:31.041 --> 04:33.041
Great seeing your
cute little face.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.375
(laughs)

04:34.458 --> 04:36.166
We still don't allow
children here,

04:36.250 --> 04:38.750
so could you put a coat over
her head when you take her out?

04:38.834 --> 04:41.250
Or we could slide down
your garbage chute.

04:41.333 --> 04:42.834
No. We don't have
a garbage chute.

04:42.917 --> 04:45.083
We're on street level.

04:47.917 --> 04:50.375
Uh, you know, I'm gonna go talk
to Jimmy real quick.

04:50.458 --> 04:51.750
Talk amongst yourselves.

04:51.834 --> 04:53.458
Hi.

04:53.542 --> 04:55.917
How old did you
say you were?

04:56.000 --> 04:58.125
Oh, we don't need
to talk about that.

04:58.208 --> 05:00.375
Hey, Dad... or, uh, Jimmy.

05:00.458 --> 05:01.834
Hey!
Hey.

05:01.917 --> 05:03.750
Uh, you know, it was really fun
seeing you tonight.

05:03.834 --> 05:05.625
Yeah, uh, but I was thinking
it would be fun

05:05.709 --> 05:07.250
to see you sometime
when you're not working.

05:07.333 --> 05:08.542
Are you kidding me?
I'd love that.

05:08.625 --> 05:10.125
You tell me when,
and I'll be there.

05:10.208 --> 05:12.333
Great! Uh, come spend the day
with us on Saturday.

05:12.417 --> 05:16.375
Eh, Saturday's not good.

05:16.458 --> 05:17.458
Yeah, we're gonna go
to the beach,

05:17.542 --> 05:18.959
cruise through a drive-through

05:19.041 --> 05:20.750
or, you know, eat inside
if we're feeling crazy.

05:20.834 --> 05:22.750
I can't. I got to go
to this party.

05:22.834 --> 05:24.417
And it's not just any party.
It's Diddy's White Party.

05:24.500 --> 05:26.000
And it's not just any
Diddy's White Party.

05:26.083 --> 05:27.458
It's the first
Diddy's White Party

05:27.542 --> 05:28.917
to hit the West Coast
since 2009.

05:29.000 --> 05:30.917
Oh, like El Niño.

05:31.000 --> 05:33.458
The El Niño
Southern Oscillation?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.250
It's a weather pattern.
Yeah, it's a rapper.

05:35.333 --> 05:36.834
See, Gerald, this is
very important to me.

05:36.917 --> 05:38.542
I mean,
it's a good chance for me

05:38.625 --> 05:40.000
to do some networking
for the restaurant,

05:40.083 --> 05:41.250
there's a whole
charity component,

05:41.333 --> 05:42.542
Kate Upton might be there.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.709
I get it. Yeah,
I just thought it'd be fun

05:44.792 --> 05:47.000
for you to, uh, see
what a family weekend's like.

05:47.083 --> 05:49.000
But, uh, I'll send you pictures.

05:49.083 --> 05:50.792
Okay.
Okay.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.333
What, Ravi?

05:54.417 --> 05:56.417
Are you really gonna blow
off your kid like that?

05:56.500 --> 05:57.542
I'm not blowing him off.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.041
I'm just setting
some boundaries.

05:59.125 --> 06:01.291
Everybody thinks that, uh,
when you have a family,

06:01.375 --> 06:03.083
you have to give up
your old life.

06:03.166 --> 06:05.542
Well, guess what.
My old life is amazing.

06:05.625 --> 06:07.333
I don't know if I'm cut out
to be those dads

06:07.417 --> 06:09.875
I see on Sunday
when I drive by the zoo.

06:09.959 --> 06:11.542
It's like, uh...
Oh, you know what?

06:11.625 --> 06:13.959
I wrote down this really
smart observation. Hold on.

06:14.041 --> 06:16.792
One second.
Uh, it's like, um...

06:16.875 --> 06:20.208
"It's like those<i> people </i>
are the ones in cages."

06:20.291 --> 06:23.250
You were driving, and you
stopped to write that down?

06:23.333 --> 06:24.792
Hmm.
Look at me.

06:24.875 --> 06:27.166
I worked very hard
to be this kind of man.

06:27.250 --> 06:29.625
This is the kind of man people
see at Diddy's White Party

06:29.709 --> 06:32.208
and say, "Yes, he should be
at Diddy's White Party."

06:32.291 --> 06:33.750
Not the kind of man
that's sitting in the back

06:33.834 --> 06:35.625
of a station wagon,
singing songs, with a fanny pack

06:35.709 --> 06:38.041
full of wipes. That's
reasonable, right, Victor?

06:38.125 --> 06:40.583
A horse kicked me
in the penis when I was 16,

06:40.667 --> 06:41.959
and now I can't have children.

06:42.041 --> 06:44.208
Jimmy, when my wife
left me last autumn,

06:44.291 --> 06:47.291
it felt like I got kicked
in the penis by a horse.

06:47.375 --> 06:50.792
My point is,
seize every moment

06:50.875 --> 06:52.667
with your family,
Jimmy, trust me.

06:52.750 --> 06:54.625
You know, maybe you're right.

06:54.709 --> 06:57.709
I'm trying to set boundaries,
and maybe I don't even want to.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.542
I mean, they're not so bad,
right?

06:59.625 --> 07:02.375
I mean, I like that baby, and
the kid clearly needs my help.

07:02.458 --> 07:03.625
What's one more party?

07:03.709 --> 07:05.125
I've been to so many parties.

07:05.208 --> 07:06.709
And Kate Upton probably won't
even show up.

07:06.792 --> 07:08.625
She never shows up.

07:08.709 --> 07:11.917
Yeah, a family day would
be good. Maybe I'll do that.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.542
If you're not going to the
party, can I go instead?
No.

07:14.625 --> 07:16.041
Can I go?

07:20.208 --> 07:22.834
God, you guys ready? Jimmy said
he'll be here any minute.

07:22.917 --> 07:24.750
Just so you know, based on
when I was dating him,

07:24.834 --> 07:26.417
that could mean anything
from "he'll be here soon"

07:26.500 --> 07:28.000
to "we'll never see him again."

07:28.083 --> 07:30.917
He'll be here.
He texted that he's excited.

07:31.000 --> 07:32.834
No, you texted him,
"Are you excited?"

07:32.917 --> 07:36.000
And he texted back, "Okay."

07:36.083 --> 07:37.000
(singsongy):
What up? What up?

07:37.083 --> 07:38.875
(singsongy):
What up with you?

07:39.000 --> 07:41.083
Oh, sorry, that wasn't for
you. Got to do this again.

07:41.166 --> 07:43.083
What up? What up?

07:43.166 --> 07:46.083
It's family fun
day, bitches!

07:46.166 --> 07:47.792
Hey, I know

07:47.875 --> 07:50.083
you have a tremendous
soul-killing crush on her.

07:50.166 --> 07:52.250
Sure do.
Can I ask why?

07:52.333 --> 07:54.917
Aside from the fact that she's
the mother of your child?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.500
And that?

07:57.583 --> 08:00.583
Look, it's like an M. Night
Shyamalan movie, you know?

08:00.667 --> 08:02.792
You think you got it all
figured out, and bang!

08:02.875 --> 08:05.083
You know, it hits you
with a crazy awesome surprise

So Vanessa's been
dead the entire time?

08:09.166 --> 08:11.500
Just try to get
to know her, all right?

08:11.583 --> 08:13.583
No! Maybe.

08:13.667 --> 08:16.583
Oh, yeah!

Pop-Pop's here!

No. Jimmy. Jimmy's here.

08:22.000 --> 08:24.709
That is a bold hat choice
you got going there, kiddo.

08:24.792 --> 08:26.834
I got you one.

08:28.792 --> 08:30.458
Um, you ready to go?

08:30.542 --> 08:33.166
Uh, do you have your swimsuit on
under that actual suit?

08:33.250 --> 08:35.959
We're gonna take Edie into
the water for the first time.

08:36.041 --> 08:38.250
Oh, I don't swim.
Old football injury.

08:38.333 --> 08:40.166
He thinks his legs
are too skinny.

08:40.250 --> 08:42.333
He always has, and he
never played football.

08:42.417 --> 08:45.166
Yes, because
my legs are too skinny.

08:45.250 --> 08:46.500
No worries. (laughs)

08:46.583 --> 08:48.166
Family fun day, y'all!

08:48.250 --> 08:52.875

15:32.333 --> 15:34.166
You know, you girls are so cool

15:34.250 --> 15:36.166
You must have been very popular
in high school.

15:36.250 --> 15:38.959
No, I was
so awkward.
Really?

15:39.041 --> 15:39.959
Hey!

15:40.041 --> 15:41.333
Excuse me.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.291
What happened to your
pretty little lady friend?

15:45.375 --> 15:46.959
We had a really nice
conversation

15:47.041 --> 15:49.125
about the beef industry,
and then her and some guys

15:49.208 --> 15:50.291
started doing a ton of cocaine.

15:50.375 --> 15:52.125
That happens.
Yeah.

15:52.208 --> 15:53.667
Uh, well, as fun as this was,

15:53.750 --> 15:55.250
maybe we should
start heading back?

15:55.333 --> 15:57.458

to check out the water.

15:57.542 --> 15:59.625

is<i> definitely </i>

15:59.709 --> 16:01.667

16:03.000 --> 16:04.959

16:05.041 --> 16:07.000
No, it's...
I don't<i> want </i>to stay.

16:07.083 --> 16:08.500
I<i> have </i>to stay.

16:08.583 --> 16:10.625
I'm refereeing a chicken fight.

16:10.709 --> 16:12.583
Great! Stay.
Yeah, ref the chicken fight.

16:12.667 --> 16:15.333
I'm gonna go play with
your granddaughter in the ocean.

16:15.417 --> 16:16.917
What, you mad at me?

16:17.000 --> 16:19.417
Come on, I put in real
time to your family day.

16:19.500 --> 16:21.333
I thought it was
<i>our </i>family day.

16:21.417 --> 16:25.125
You-you have spent this entire
day being embarrassed by us.

16:25.208 --> 16:27.583

singing "This Old Man"

16:27.667 --> 16:29.417
500 times in my mom's hatchback?

16:29.500 --> 16:31.250

I like keeping track

16:31.333 --> 16:32.750
of how many baby wipes we have?

16:32.834 --> 16:34.750
I know I look like a dork
in this hat,

16:34.834 --> 16:37.208
but I have to wear it
because my daughter loves

16:37.291 --> 16:39.250
building sand castles,
but she sucks at it,

16:39.333 --> 16:42.250
and so, it takes forever,
and I get sunburned.

16:42.333 --> 16:45.458
You know, family is an endless
stream of just exhausting crap

16:45.542 --> 16:47.959
that makes you feel like
the least cool person on earth,

16:48.041 --> 16:50.500
but... but you do it
because you love your kid.

16:50.583 --> 16:53.291
I mean, 'cause sometimes,
you get these amazing moments,

16:53.375 --> 16:55.959
like watching her go
in the ocean for the first time.

16:56.041 --> 16:58.333
Which I'm not gonna miss
just explaining this to you.

16:58.417 --> 17:00.333
Okay, I get it.
Let's go back.

17:00.417 --> 17:02.333
Just stay, all right?
You don't have to do

17:02.417 --> 17:03.583
anything you don't want to do.

17:03.667 --> 17:05.291
That's the beauty
of this thing, right?

17:05.375 --> 17:06.709
We're adults. I'm 25.

17:06.792 --> 17:08.500
I'm 25 and a half.

17:08.583 --> 17:10.208
No one uses the fraction.

17:11.583 --> 17:13.083
Look, just stay, okay?

17:13.166 --> 17:14.667
You don't owe me anything,
seriously.

17:16.750 --> 17:19.458
Oh, by the way, I think
your pink shirt is dorky.

17:19.542 --> 17:21.458
Really?
No, it's...

17:21.542 --> 17:24.083
You pull it off really well.

17:29.625 --> 17:30.792
(laughter)

17:30.875 --> 17:32.542
How did you get in here?

17:32.625 --> 17:34.083
Gerald gave me
his wristband.

17:34.166 --> 17:35.834
So, are any
of these girls gay?

17:35.917 --> 17:37.417
Or mad at their parents?

17:37.500 --> 17:40.250
Damn it, now I know
how Victor felt.

17:40.333 --> 17:43.333
What?

17:43.417 --> 17:45.250
What?!

17:45.333 --> 17:48.458
Hey, do you think Edie's
gone in the water yet?

17:48.542 --> 17:50.500
I'll see if Vanessa
posted any photos.

17:50.583 --> 17:52.792
You follow her?
Since the day
I met her.

17:52.875 --> 17:54.417
That sounded creepy.

17:54.500 --> 17:57.041
Whatever. I'm fine with it.

17:57.125 --> 18:00.000
Guess who's getting
in the water for the first time!

18:00.083 --> 18:01.583
We are!

18:01.667 --> 18:04.125
ADRIANA:
Jimmy, get in here!

18:04.208 --> 18:06.667
I need man to sit on! (laughs)

18:08.709 --> 18:11.583
(sighs) Does anyone have a
bathing suit I could borrow?

18:11.667 --> 18:13.500
I have one for you.

18:17.959 --> 18:19.917
One, two, three!

18:20.000 --> 18:21.667
So if I can get a
big online fan base,

18:21.750 --> 18:24.166
I can make up to six figures
with the YouTube videos

18:24.250 --> 18:25.750
and work around
Edie's schedule.

18:25.834 --> 18:27.709
So that's why you take
all those pictures of yourself.

18:27.792 --> 18:30.875
That's smart. Let me know if
there's any way I can help you.

18:30.959 --> 18:33.250
Well, actually, uh,

18:33.333 --> 18:35.875
it is really hard to take
pictures of your own butt.

18:35.959 --> 18:38.208
I'd be honored
to take pictures of your butt.

18:38.291 --> 18:39.375
Really?

18:39.458 --> 18:40.667
Ready for the ocean, bubby?

18:40.750 --> 18:42.959
Come on. Come on, guys!
Let's do it!

18:45.083 --> 18:47.750
JIMMY:
Wait! Hold on!

18:47.834 --> 18:49.750
Wait for me!

19:08.417 --> 19:10.125
I got the wipes.

19:11.166 --> 19:12.458
Wow.

19:12.542 --> 19:14.500
You really do have skinny legs.

19:14.583 --> 19:16.291
I'm glad I got Mom's.
Hers are more...

19:16.375 --> 19:18.125
There's no good way
to finish that.
Sorry.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.750
I feel people staring
at my legs.

19:19.834 --> 19:21.458
I'm gonna go in the water.
