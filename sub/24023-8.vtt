WEBVTT

00:00.613 --> 00:02.252
Previously on Harrow...

00:02.567 --> 00:05.494
If Quinn is dead, you know
that Bryan will find the killer.

00:05.526 --> 00:07.845
That might not be Quinn.
-Well, we're diving again.

00:07.879 --> 00:10.131
If we find that skull,
it'll be a done deal.

00:10.312 --> 00:12.762
The Geneva Institute wants me.

00:12.807 --> 00:15.317
That says, "To
Professor Maxine Pavich."

00:15.342 --> 00:17.244
Are you stealing both
of their identities?

00:18.007 --> 00:19.465
Quinn's phone.

00:19.838 --> 00:22.486
We found a message on Quinn's
phone from Steph Tolson.

00:22.531 --> 00:23.876
That's it, I warned you.

00:23.900 --> 00:26.087
Now when I find you, I'm
gonna fucking kill you.

00:26.241 --> 00:28.365
Why are you here? What have you found?

00:28.407 --> 00:30.228
You know he always
took care of that car.

00:30.253 --> 00:32.996
In the last ten months, has there
been a claim made against it?

00:33.106 --> 00:34.982
I don't think we can
tell Harrow about this.

00:35.007 --> 00:37.237
It's a conflict of interest. He
was married to Quinn's wife.

00:37.299 --> 00:39.698
Quinn's car has come up.
-How do you know?

00:39.767 --> 00:40.927
I'm staring at it.

00:40.983 --> 00:42.836
And when were you going to
tell me about Quinn's car?

00:42.879 --> 00:44.119
Don't you trust me?

00:46.000 --> 00:52.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:15.807 --> 03:18.355
Using my exam room without
asking is one thing,

03:18.459 --> 03:20.578
but that album is a first pressing.

03:20.713 --> 03:24.032
And you're not rostered on
until midday. Why are you here?

03:24.127 --> 03:25.498
I work here.

03:25.567 --> 03:28.521
You, however, have an office
two flights up, remember?

03:28.652 --> 03:31.647
Do you know how long it's been
since I've picked up tools?

03:31.953 --> 03:33.232
Seven years.

03:33.287 --> 03:36.007
You know, they say you never
forget, they're right.

03:37.047 --> 03:39.465
This feels really good. Can
you pass me that dish?

03:39.532 --> 03:41.066
And I'm guessing the Geneva job

03:41.091 --> 03:43.156
doesn't involve picking up tools.

03:45.193 --> 03:47.841
No, it's pure academia.

03:47.961 --> 03:51.002
But it's an internationally
recognised institution,

03:51.027 --> 03:53.673
it's great pay and there's
Swiss chocolate on tap,

03:53.726 --> 03:56.765
and I don't have to listen
to you and Fairley fight

03:56.807 --> 03:58.141
like cats in a sack.

03:58.192 --> 04:00.236
Fairley's a bit more ferrety.

04:00.406 --> 04:03.085
My dysfunctional forensic family.

04:03.388 --> 04:06.514
You were prepared to walk away
from us, from all of this.

04:06.581 --> 04:08.246
For my actual family.

04:11.487 --> 04:14.218
What about Nichols? Does he know
you're thinking about Geneva?

04:14.253 --> 04:17.373
No. No, no, no. Don't
you dare say anything.

04:18.480 --> 04:20.725
Pick up, come on. Shit.

04:20.858 --> 04:22.520
Hi, you've reached Maxine Pavich.

04:22.545 --> 04:24.391
Leave a message and
I'll get back to you.

04:24.487 --> 04:27.404
Yeah, Max, hi. It's, Bryan.

04:27.666 --> 04:29.958
Um, just haven't heard from
you in the last couple of days

04:29.983 --> 04:32.094
and wondering if everything's OK.

04:32.607 --> 04:35.366
So, can you just give us a buzz?

04:35.552 --> 04:36.926
I miss ya, sweetheart.

04:39.287 --> 04:40.927
Get back to work.

04:44.019 --> 04:45.019
Sarge?

04:46.607 --> 04:49.852
Quinn's car?
-Yes. But look at the tyres.

04:50.172 --> 04:52.606
The ones on the left
side are badly worn,

04:52.700 --> 04:54.394
at least a couple of years old.

04:54.620 --> 04:57.260
But both tyres on the right side...

04:57.360 --> 04:58.963
Well, they look brand-new.

04:59.053 --> 05:01.452
Well, usually two new tyres'd
go on the front or the back,

05:01.500 --> 05:02.739
not on one side.

05:02.807 --> 05:05.135
OK, let's find out where
Quinn got those tyres.

05:05.453 --> 05:06.773
Good work.

05:09.520 --> 05:12.555
I didn't hear you get up.
What are you looking at?

05:13.055 --> 05:15.165
Sorry, I couldn't sleep.

05:15.219 --> 05:17.658
Ha, it's not too
late to go back to bed.

05:17.733 --> 05:19.132
You want some tea?

05:19.588 --> 05:21.276
Sure.

05:21.742 --> 05:24.378
Listen, I was thinking
about that camping trip.

05:24.487 --> 05:26.406
What camping trip?
-Exactly.

05:26.479 --> 05:28.412
The one we never got to take.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.240
How about we head up
to the coast on Friday

05:30.265 --> 05:31.826
and make a long weekend out of it?

05:31.913 --> 05:34.821
I'd love to, Jesse, but it's
just... It's not a good time.

05:35.194 --> 05:36.766
What is it?

05:36.920 --> 05:39.180
Is it work? Is it Fern?

05:39.206 --> 05:40.645
Is it...? Is it me?

05:40.799 --> 05:41.799
No.

05:41.824 --> 05:45.372
I just... I just need to be at
home right now, that's all.

05:51.840 --> 05:53.480
Is this for Robert?

05:55.027 --> 05:56.027
Yeah.

05:56.746 --> 05:59.505
No, I mean, I... I
don't know, actually.

05:59.647 --> 06:01.726
Do you want to talk about it?
-No.

06:01.993 --> 06:03.873
I'm fine. It's fine.

06:05.546 --> 06:06.812
OK.

06:07.037 --> 06:10.046
I'll probably skip tea and
get a jump on the traffic.

06:10.122 --> 06:11.191
OK.

06:11.233 --> 06:12.632
I'll call ya.

06:47.339 --> 06:49.498
What are you doing in here?
-What does it look like?

06:49.846 --> 06:50.846
But...

06:50.926 --> 06:52.519
But you haven't done an autopsy in...

06:52.559 --> 06:56.078
Seven years. I almost forgot
how good she looked in scrubs.

06:56.167 --> 06:57.726
But you... I mean you can't...

06:57.820 --> 06:59.581
You're not supposed to be in here...

06:59.606 --> 07:01.403
What are you concerned about, Lyle?

07:01.428 --> 07:02.769
Are you worried that I might have

07:02.794 --> 07:04.547
a change of heart about Geneva?

07:04.647 --> 07:05.828
What?

07:05.946 --> 07:07.185
No, of course not.

07:07.373 --> 07:08.493
Are you?

07:08.518 --> 07:11.277
Deputy Coroner told me you
rang him about my job.

07:12.207 --> 07:14.126
That's not very sporting of you, Lyle.

07:14.193 --> 07:15.405
I mean, why shouldn't I?

07:15.430 --> 07:17.789
I have just the right
attributes for the position.

07:17.846 --> 07:19.645
Is backstabbing an attribute?

07:20.386 --> 07:23.017
You know, I really don't
appreciate the pressure

07:23.042 --> 07:24.366
this puts me under, Lyle,

07:24.391 --> 07:27.791
and I certainly don't appreciate
you going over my head.

07:28.497 --> 07:30.323
Until I make a decision...

07:30.786 --> 07:34.106
this job is still mine.

07:35.300 --> 07:38.319
If you'd like me to write you
a letter of recommendation...

07:42.207 --> 07:43.807
Get out of my way.

07:46.246 --> 07:47.558
Should I ask?

07:47.647 --> 07:48.807
No.

07:48.883 --> 07:49.988
What are you doing here, anyway?

07:50.013 --> 07:52.357
I thought you were heading up the
coast for Vivienne's birthday?

07:52.382 --> 07:53.918
His name is still David,

07:54.019 --> 07:56.538
and I am taking him to a
resort for his 30th.

07:56.693 --> 07:57.733
We're leaving after lunch.

07:57.768 --> 08:00.127
Good. You can finish up here.

08:01.139 --> 08:02.299
Bye.

08:12.520 --> 08:13.992
Hey, it's me.

08:14.064 --> 08:15.943
Fancy getting out of the office?

08:37.767 --> 08:38.807
Hi.

08:38.979 --> 08:41.102
Hey. Early morning call for you.

08:41.192 --> 08:42.932
Sorry, I felt bad waking you up.

08:43.011 --> 08:45.045
I felt bad waking alone.

08:45.223 --> 08:46.582
Who's the boy?

08:46.607 --> 08:49.634
Rhys Weir, 17-year-old
Alderly High School student

08:49.659 --> 08:51.634
and member of the rowing squad.

08:51.883 --> 08:54.542
His body was spotted early
this morning by a rower.

08:54.753 --> 08:58.703
His backpack, clothes and phone
were in his car up there.

08:58.969 --> 09:00.589
He had a key to let himself into

09:00.614 --> 09:01.962
the rowing shed to get his scull,

09:01.987 --> 09:03.546
which was found downstream.

09:03.793 --> 09:05.529
It appears he's driven himself here

09:05.554 --> 09:07.176
to take an early morning row,

09:07.263 --> 09:11.804
slipped and hit his head as
he was trying to launch.

09:11.906 --> 09:14.426
Careful, there's algae.
It's pretty slippery.

09:18.207 --> 09:21.554
A single massive fracture
to the back of the skull.

09:21.672 --> 09:23.768
Consistent with a fall
onto a hard edge?

09:24.487 --> 09:26.148
Looks like it.

09:26.426 --> 09:28.426
But?
-Feel his face.

09:31.503 --> 09:32.663
Quite cold.

09:32.984 --> 09:35.222
I checked his temperature, ambient.

09:35.434 --> 09:37.280
He's been dead for at least five hours.

09:37.834 --> 09:41.055
So the time of death was...
-2am or earlier.

09:42.999 --> 09:44.199
I know.

09:44.248 --> 09:46.673
Who goes rowing at 2
o'clock in the morning?

09:47.286 --> 09:49.475
All the senior rowers
have a key to the shed,

09:49.567 --> 09:51.827
but they're not allowed
access before 5am.

09:52.052 --> 09:54.802
Is there any reason he would
have gone down there that early?

09:54.893 --> 09:57.607
Well, I suspect because of
what happened yesterday,

09:57.846 --> 09:59.165
State Rowing Carnival.

09:59.527 --> 10:02.126
All the local state and
private schools compete.

10:02.540 --> 10:04.915
We were defending the title
for the eighth year in a row.

10:05.006 --> 10:07.962
Unfortunately, Rhys lost
the single sculls event.

10:08.082 --> 10:09.749
Mistimed his stroke,

10:09.806 --> 10:12.045
and the school lost the
title by six points.

10:12.616 --> 10:13.923
How did Rhys take it?

10:14.136 --> 10:16.497
Did you see his Instagram
post from last night?

10:23.463 --> 10:24.929
He was gay?

10:25.039 --> 10:26.478
Yes, came out last year.

10:26.567 --> 10:28.227
But his schoolmates, and the faculty,

10:28.252 --> 10:30.052
have been nothing but supportive.

10:32.219 --> 10:34.458
Well, not everyone it seems.

10:35.273 --> 10:37.559
Who's Luke Chambers?

10:38.066 --> 10:40.706
One of Rhys's teammates from the quads.

10:42.606 --> 10:44.165
That's him on the far left.

10:44.246 --> 10:46.525
Luke's being eyed for a
scholarship at the Institute.

10:46.648 --> 10:47.959
Very driven kid.

10:48.007 --> 10:49.540
I've no doubt yesterday's loss

10:49.565 --> 10:51.300
will put his scholarship in jeopardy.

10:51.436 --> 10:54.040
Eight years in a row and
Rhys lost the trophy.

10:54.183 --> 10:55.622
He must have felt a bit of pressure.

10:56.047 --> 10:57.207
Not from the school.

10:57.247 --> 10:58.582
What about his family?

10:58.693 --> 11:00.140
You know it's just his father, right?

11:00.200 --> 11:02.073
Yeah, we contacted him in Dubai.

11:02.098 --> 11:03.866
He's returning on the next flight out.

11:04.038 --> 11:05.907
Rhys lived by himself most of the time,

11:05.992 --> 11:07.394
but he was very independent.

11:07.467 --> 11:09.000
Drove himself around.

11:09.087 --> 11:11.248
He was confident. Well liked.

11:11.413 --> 11:12.787
Feeling pretty low

11:12.853 --> 11:15.373
having ruined the school's
eight-year winning streak.

11:17.027 --> 11:20.215
So do you think Rhys went
to the river to try to... what?,

11:20.240 --> 11:22.079
redo the event he lost?

11:22.126 --> 11:23.565
At two o'clock in the morning?

11:23.607 --> 11:25.006
That's when the demons come, isn't it?

11:27.569 --> 11:29.270
You're kidding me.

11:30.346 --> 11:33.666
Is this you? Top of the class.

11:34.981 --> 11:37.140
I thought you went to a
private school with Fairley?

11:37.165 --> 11:38.187
I did.

11:38.212 --> 11:40.486
Until I dropped out and came here.

11:40.719 --> 11:42.026
Long story.

11:51.045 --> 11:53.302
Significant impact trauma

11:53.327 --> 11:56.110
visible on the posterior of the head.

11:56.209 --> 11:59.357
Breach of the scalp and
deep skin lacerations

11:59.382 --> 12:02.868
consistent with a fall
onto a hard surface.

12:03.100 --> 12:04.679
Do we have the CT scan?

12:07.266 --> 12:09.066
Significant depressed fracture

12:09.091 --> 12:11.180
in the occipital and parietal bones.

12:11.340 --> 12:12.340
And there...

12:12.417 --> 12:15.245
Bone fragments.
-Being driven into the brain tissue.

12:15.347 --> 12:17.866
Quick loss of consciousness
and rapid death

12:17.926 --> 12:19.868
from an intracerebral haemorrhage.

12:19.927 --> 12:22.846
So this poor kid blames
himself for losing the title,

12:22.900 --> 12:24.198
heads out in the early hours

12:24.253 --> 12:26.086
to prove to himself
that he's not a loser...

12:26.173 --> 12:27.899
Slips on the boat ramp and dies.

12:28.199 --> 12:30.606
Being gay, do you think
that added to the pressure?

12:30.748 --> 12:32.031
High school's hard enough

12:32.056 --> 12:34.632
without the added bonus of
coming out to your friends.

12:35.160 --> 12:37.439
Do you want me to swab
the wound? Do a full tox?

12:37.573 --> 12:39.686
Yes, then we'll turn the body.

12:42.543 --> 12:44.222
Healthy musculature,

12:44.247 --> 12:48.328
skin pallor consistent on
legs, arms and abdomen.

12:48.906 --> 12:50.986
What does this look like to you?

12:51.943 --> 12:53.342
Scratches.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.714
A cold sore, maybe?

12:54.773 --> 12:56.813
Endocam.

12:58.647 --> 13:00.527
Thank you.

13:04.439 --> 13:07.344
Look at the swelling of
his tongue and throat.

13:08.087 --> 13:10.678
His windpipe is almost
completely blocked.

13:10.800 --> 13:13.319
Anaphylaxis?
-Maybe.

13:13.621 --> 13:17.416
Let's do a histamine test and
get a beta-tryptase count,

13:17.441 --> 13:18.517
and we'll open his stomach

13:18.542 --> 13:21.309
and see if we can find
what triggered this.

13:21.463 --> 13:23.203
I don't get it.

13:23.313 --> 13:25.541
Going rowing at 2am is one thing,

13:25.579 --> 13:28.679
but who goes rowing while
they're suffering anaphylaxis?

13:32.180 --> 13:35.079
Well, the school nurse is
adamant Rhys had no allergies,

13:35.104 --> 13:36.936
at least none that he
told the school about.

13:37.028 --> 13:39.595
But we know that he was
exposed to something

13:39.620 --> 13:41.234
that triggered an allergic reaction,

13:41.259 --> 13:43.098
just before he slipped and fell.

13:43.301 --> 13:45.216
How long's it take for
anaphylaxis to kick in?

13:45.253 --> 13:48.612
A severe attack? Minutes,
seconds even, after exposure.

13:48.687 --> 13:49.923
So whatever the allergen was,

13:49.948 --> 13:52.134
he must have been exposed to it here.

13:53.346 --> 13:55.465
Was there any food or drink in his car?

13:55.684 --> 13:58.014
No. None in his backpack, either.

13:58.633 --> 14:00.273
Can we take a look in the shed?

14:05.019 --> 14:07.218
Do they keep any food or drink in here?

14:07.333 --> 14:09.333
Maybe in their lockers.

14:21.433 --> 14:22.913
No food.

14:25.607 --> 14:26.967
Water.

14:31.573 --> 14:33.099
Look at this.

14:34.427 --> 14:37.347
Leave who alone?
-Rhys was gay.

14:39.053 --> 14:42.049
Maybe it was written by a
jealous boyfriend or girlfriend?

14:42.127 --> 14:43.779
It doesn't help us solve the allergy.

14:47.303 --> 14:48.569
Did you find something?

14:48.636 --> 14:50.666
Rhys Weir's bloods have come back.

14:50.691 --> 14:54.050
His tryptase and histamine
counts are through the roof.

14:54.223 --> 14:55.742
Anaphylaxis.

14:55.809 --> 14:57.542
What about his stomach contents?

14:57.633 --> 14:59.479
Any idea what the
allergen could have been?

14:59.553 --> 15:01.828
There was no food in his
stomach or lower intestine,

15:01.933 --> 15:03.292
he hadn't eaten all day.

15:03.406 --> 15:07.126
But I did find traces of
undigested base proteins

15:07.173 --> 15:08.373
in his oesophagus.

15:08.488 --> 15:10.623
Such as?
-I'm still running the tests.

15:10.687 --> 15:12.082
Hey, but get this,

15:12.166 --> 15:14.885
his blood alcohol level was 0.02.

15:15.208 --> 15:16.902
So he'd been drinking.

15:17.137 --> 15:18.606
Yeah, one or two it seems.

15:18.706 --> 15:20.026
OK, thanks.

15:21.120 --> 15:24.181
Think he was drinking alone?
-Let's find out.

15:25.971 --> 15:28.142
We all came back to my
place after the carnival.

15:28.204 --> 15:29.418
Me, Sean, Luke and Rhys.

15:29.533 --> 15:31.172
Why?

15:31.620 --> 15:34.881
Mostly to make Rhys feel better.
He was feeling pretty sh...

15:36.453 --> 15:38.740
pretty low after the race.

15:38.932 --> 15:40.556
We thought we might cheer him up.

15:41.060 --> 15:42.700
What were you drinking?

15:46.447 --> 15:49.047
Answer the question please, Ash.

15:51.767 --> 15:53.567
A... a couple of beers.

15:55.100 --> 15:56.540
Vodka.

15:58.307 --> 16:01.192
Did Rhys ever have an allergic
reaction to anything?

16:01.833 --> 16:03.432
What, like sneezing?

16:03.553 --> 16:05.913
Choking. Shortness of breath.

16:09.007 --> 16:12.526
What'd Rhys drink?
-One or two vodkas, that's it.

16:12.700 --> 16:14.246
And he drove himself home?

16:14.441 --> 16:15.942
Yes. We...

16:16.083 --> 16:17.831
We were all too...

16:18.327 --> 16:20.004
We couldn't drive.

16:20.136 --> 16:21.296
When?

16:21.493 --> 16:23.046
Rhys left first.

16:23.114 --> 16:24.568
About one o'clock.

16:24.736 --> 16:27.206
OK... Did he say where he was going?

16:27.439 --> 16:29.790
No, we thought he was going home.

16:31.960 --> 16:34.920
How did he seem?
-He seemed pretty happy to me.

16:42.367 --> 16:45.688
Luke, did you write this?

16:46.668 --> 16:49.258
Yeah, look, I was pretty upset, too.

16:49.959 --> 16:53.212
OK? It was a mistake. It was stupid.

16:53.696 --> 16:55.108
I shouldn't have done it.

16:55.186 --> 16:58.726
We also found this in Rhys's locker.

16:59.826 --> 17:01.306
Do you know who wrote it?

17:02.146 --> 17:03.575
None of us wrote it.

17:03.687 --> 17:06.606
Ash? Luke?

17:06.772 --> 17:08.292
It wasn't us.

17:09.252 --> 17:11.174
Do you know who it's referring to?

17:13.607 --> 17:17.327
Did Rhys have a boyfriend? Boyfriends?

17:20.319 --> 17:21.679
What about you guys?

17:23.239 --> 17:24.734
No.

17:24.887 --> 17:27.421
I have a girlfriend. We
all have girlfriends.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.893
What's this got to do with how he died?

17:34.300 --> 17:35.740
Are we done?

17:37.100 --> 17:38.420
Yeah.

17:40.167 --> 17:42.366
Not quite the tight crew I expected.

17:42.424 --> 17:43.772
No.

17:43.807 --> 17:45.016
But it doesn't bring us any closer

17:45.041 --> 17:46.760
to knowing what triggered
his anaphylaxis.

17:47.948 --> 17:50.947
I have to go and lodge
some paperwork. Call me.

18:07.040 --> 18:08.400
Need a hand?

18:09.966 --> 18:11.446
Not from you.

18:13.287 --> 18:15.746
What was that about?
-None of your business.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.999
You still angry about
Rhys losing that race?

18:18.120 --> 18:20.279
Yeah... I am.

18:20.369 --> 18:23.238
I've worked really hard for this
scholarship to the Institute.

18:23.419 --> 18:25.378
I can't repeat again.

18:25.447 --> 18:27.196
I'm sorry that Rhys is dead,

18:27.221 --> 18:28.364
but him losing that race

18:28.389 --> 18:30.395
means that I'm probably
not going to get in.

18:39.113 --> 18:40.473
Psst, Harrow.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.508
Have you, um, spoken to Maxine

18:46.579 --> 18:48.698
since this morning
about, you know, Geneva?

18:49.594 --> 18:53.539
No, but what you said has
given me a chance to reflect,

18:53.580 --> 18:55.659
and I thought if the job's
good enough for Fairley,

18:55.826 --> 18:57.185
perhaps I should give it a shot.

18:57.247 --> 19:00.630
What? No. No. Absolutely not.

19:00.733 --> 19:02.892
You are not management material.

19:02.953 --> 19:05.112
Says who?
-Says me.

19:05.167 --> 19:06.735
You disregard protocols,

19:06.760 --> 19:09.299
you have nothing but contempt
for your colleagues,

19:09.478 --> 19:10.827
your office is a mess,

19:10.927 --> 19:12.800
and do you even know
what a razor looks like?

19:12.867 --> 19:15.935
I suggest that you leave
this one alone, Harrow.

19:16.573 --> 19:19.973
If anyone's getting
that head job, it's me.

19:20.353 --> 19:22.393
That's not what it sounded like.

19:23.820 --> 19:25.179
Again, should I ask?

19:25.452 --> 19:27.222
Again, no.

19:27.318 --> 19:28.505
Lab results are in.

19:28.537 --> 19:30.337
We found a mystery protein.

19:31.180 --> 19:32.499
Semen?

19:32.727 --> 19:35.956
Rhys had Seminal Plasma
Hypersensitivity,

19:36.047 --> 19:37.671
he was allergic to semen.

19:37.726 --> 19:38.750
But not all semen,

19:38.775 --> 19:41.453
just the prostate antigens
of one particular male.

19:41.500 --> 19:44.140
So he was giving oral sex...

19:44.807 --> 19:46.807
Moments later started choking.

19:50.020 --> 19:51.602
So if it happened that fast...

19:51.702 --> 19:54.188
The person he was with
would still be around.

19:57.240 --> 19:59.522
Those semen traces you recovered,

19:59.554 --> 20:00.912
do you think there's viable DNA?

20:00.968 --> 20:02.886
If there is, I can get it.

20:02.953 --> 20:04.993
What are you going to do?

20:08.627 --> 20:09.906
Thanks for coming in.

20:09.931 --> 20:12.170
We'll let you know if we
need anything further.

20:12.247 --> 20:14.847
Julian, Sean, come on through.

20:16.428 --> 20:17.488
Come on.

20:17.573 --> 20:18.573
Hi.

20:19.847 --> 20:22.726
We're asking all the boys who
were with Rhys the night he died

20:22.751 --> 20:25.230
to provide a saliva
swab for DNA testing.

20:25.505 --> 20:26.784
Why?

20:27.051 --> 20:32.693
Rhys had sexual contact with a
male, just before he died.

20:32.939 --> 20:34.926
And you're suggesting that
could have been my son?

20:35.026 --> 20:36.746
No...
-My boy isn't gay.

20:36.807 --> 20:39.447
It's OK, Dad. I'm happy to do it.
-No, you're not.

20:40.687 --> 20:45.369
That dead boy, Rhys, he was
gay and everyone knew it.

20:45.635 --> 20:47.377
They also knew he lived alone,

20:47.490 --> 20:50.423
he was unsupervised, he had a car,

20:50.586 --> 20:53.128
he could have gone to a club,
to a boyfriend's house,

20:53.153 --> 20:55.432
to God knows where.

20:55.527 --> 20:59.526
So why are you picking on my son
and maligning his reputation...

20:59.608 --> 21:02.181
Maligning now?
-I know how the world works.

21:02.359 --> 21:05.278
You start suggesting that
he is anything like that,

21:05.367 --> 21:06.883
you start slandering him....

21:06.967 --> 21:09.126
Someone's sexuality is slander?

21:09.193 --> 21:11.246
...doors will close on him

21:11.327 --> 21:12.966
and I won't let that happen.

21:13.052 --> 21:15.804
Your son said he was happy
to provide a sample.

21:15.880 --> 21:17.652
Well, I'm saying he's not.
-OK.

21:17.713 --> 21:20.452
Well, we're left with no
choice but to seek an order.

21:20.567 --> 21:24.126
Fine. Get it. See how you go.

21:27.173 --> 21:28.693
Sean.

22:04.140 --> 22:07.333
Robert Quinn. Did you know him?

22:07.647 --> 22:10.395
Doesn't ring a bell.
-Hey, hey, hey, hey.

22:11.487 --> 22:15.880
Have another look. '99 blue Commodore.

22:16.410 --> 22:17.480
Sorry.

22:17.505 --> 22:20.863
No, see that's funny, Leo,
because I have a receipt here

22:21.043 --> 22:24.900
for two tyres sold by you to
Robert Quinn 11 months ago.

22:25.527 --> 22:28.665
Now, unless you want to be charged
with obstruction of justice,

22:28.859 --> 22:31.179
I suggest you stop
pulling my middle leg.

22:33.935 --> 22:35.836
Alright, take Mr Little
down to headquarters.

22:35.914 --> 22:38.193
Wait, wait. OK.

22:38.287 --> 22:40.515
Yeah, I do remember Quinn
and his blue Commodore.

22:40.540 --> 22:42.019
That you fitted two tyres to?

22:42.247 --> 22:44.836
Yeah.
-On the same side of the car. Why?

22:44.967 --> 22:47.215
Someone hacked into the
sidewall with a screwdriver.

22:47.320 --> 22:50.129
Hey. Don't go away, Leo.

22:52.567 --> 22:54.086
Nichols.

22:54.421 --> 22:56.335
A skull? When?

22:56.454 --> 22:58.574
Is it on its way to Turbot Street?

23:00.447 --> 23:02.519
But why should I do it?

23:02.553 --> 23:05.552
Because I am telling you to.

23:05.640 --> 23:09.079
But it's Harrow's case. He
should identify the skull.

23:09.207 --> 23:12.015
You gave it to him.
-And now I'm giving it to you.

23:12.060 --> 23:14.659
Fine.

23:14.767 --> 23:16.326
And do me a favour?

23:16.466 --> 23:18.246
Don't mention this to Harrow.

23:18.373 --> 23:21.727
Why? What's this about, Maxine?

23:26.680 --> 23:28.440
Oooh.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.447
Shit.

24:14.163 --> 24:15.313
Hey, you.

24:15.380 --> 24:17.959
Yeah, you. Who the hell are you?

24:18.046 --> 24:19.946
I've told you a thousand times,

24:20.010 --> 24:23.349
that it's Robert's debt, not mine.

24:28.729 --> 24:31.372
Soroya Dass.
-Soroya, hi.

24:31.417 --> 24:33.177
It's Stephanie Tolson.

24:34.186 --> 24:35.879
I'm used to having debt collectors

24:35.904 --> 24:37.185
knock on the door at all hours,

24:37.213 --> 24:38.965
but these guys...

24:40.767 --> 24:43.802
Am I under surveillance?
-What?

24:44.288 --> 24:45.679
I don't know.

24:45.807 --> 24:48.118
We still haven't identified the
bones we found in the river

24:48.143 --> 24:50.773
as your husband, so... no.

24:51.479 --> 24:54.852
It's just I thought with his car
coming up and it looking like...

24:54.877 --> 24:56.132
Like, er...

24:57.280 --> 24:59.082
Robert was murdered.

25:01.339 --> 25:05.738
Is there any reason the police
might suspect you were involved?

25:06.073 --> 25:07.313
No.

25:08.959 --> 25:10.199
No.

25:11.367 --> 25:14.407
They probably were
just debt collectors. I'm sorry.

25:15.632 --> 25:19.058
Want one?
-Technically I'm still on duty.

25:19.512 --> 25:20.926
Tea?

25:21.160 --> 25:22.560
Sure.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.992
I'm sorry about the mess.

25:29.100 --> 25:34.172
I'm just sorting through stuff
that I don't wear anymore.

25:46.314 --> 25:48.349
This is Robert Quinn's.

25:49.322 --> 25:52.370
Where did you get this? You said
you didn't have any of his stuff.

25:54.727 --> 25:58.087
Steph, you need to tell Nichols
about this. This is important.

25:59.674 --> 26:01.153
Why?

26:01.602 --> 26:03.638
Why would you not tell
us that you had this?

26:03.927 --> 26:05.967
Because it's not your business.

26:20.067 --> 26:21.609
Shit.

26:21.987 --> 26:24.266
Why didn't you tell me you
had her under surveillance?

26:24.407 --> 26:25.873
You don't put someone
under surveillance

26:25.898 --> 26:27.937
without a good reason, Bryan.

26:28.127 --> 26:29.666
You've found something, haven't you?

26:29.767 --> 26:30.899
What is it?

26:30.968 --> 26:32.386
What? What's going on?

26:32.493 --> 26:36.098
Soroya, that's why we
brought you in here, OK?

26:36.780 --> 26:38.941
We figured you need to know.

26:40.624 --> 26:42.966
Stephanie Tolson is now
a person of interest

26:42.991 --> 26:44.903
in the disappearance of Robert Quinn.

26:46.880 --> 26:48.429
Steph?

26:48.647 --> 26:50.511
OK, Quinn's phone.

26:50.671 --> 26:53.206
We found it in his car and
we've accessed his voicemails.

26:53.550 --> 26:56.422
Soroya, this stays in this room.
-Yeah.

26:56.525 --> 26:58.129
This was left on Quinn's voicemail

26:58.154 --> 27:00.161
the day before his car
went into the dam.

27:01.998 --> 27:04.204
Fucking arsehole.
That's it. I warned you.

27:04.287 --> 27:06.887
Now when I find you,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

27:09.767 --> 27:11.987
Now Quinn was insured for half a mill.

27:12.111 --> 27:14.350
A payout like that would have
covered her debts nicely.

27:14.446 --> 27:17.023
We've also discovered that two of
Quinn's car tyres were slashed

27:17.048 --> 27:19.189
less than a week before the
car went into the dam.

27:19.314 --> 27:20.674
Pretty angry gesture.

27:21.647 --> 27:23.526
Now we know you went and saw Steph.

27:23.606 --> 27:26.496
Did she say or do anything to
make you think she was involved

27:26.521 --> 27:28.281
in Quinn's disappearance?

27:29.553 --> 27:30.873
Sergeant?

27:34.327 --> 27:37.266
She's got Quinn's wedding ring.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.196
It's in the house. I
read the inscription.

27:41.859 --> 27:43.498
Well, thank you, Soroya.

27:44.013 --> 27:45.279
Wait.

27:45.327 --> 27:47.582
I know the skeleton we found
had a ring finger cut,

27:47.607 --> 27:49.766
but we still don't know
if the bones are Quinn's.

27:50.311 --> 27:52.211
Our divers found a skull in the river.

27:52.327 --> 27:54.492
Turbot Street has confirmed
it's Robert Quinn.

27:54.640 --> 27:56.079
He was murdered.

27:56.147 --> 27:58.707
And Steph Tolson's looking
pretty good for it.

28:03.709 --> 28:07.204
Not a good time.
-Yeah, well, it's not great news.

28:07.367 --> 28:09.822
Good, I could use some cheering up.

28:09.995 --> 28:12.662
Julian Paulson's lawyer just rang.

28:12.714 --> 28:13.874
Let me guess,

28:13.928 --> 28:16.481
he's appealing our request
for his son's DNA sample?

28:16.593 --> 28:18.392
Yeah, and it gets worse.

28:18.453 --> 28:21.212
Now all the boys are
refusing to give samples.

28:21.461 --> 28:23.159
All of them?

28:23.208 --> 28:24.441
So we're going to have
to take this all the way

28:24.465 --> 28:25.500
to the Supreme Court,

28:25.525 --> 28:26.895
which means it's going
to be a few weeks

28:26.920 --> 28:29.712
before we can rule any of those
rowing squad boys in or out.

28:29.927 --> 28:32.446
Shit. OK.

28:32.946 --> 28:34.946
Look, I've gotta go.
-Daniel?

28:40.526 --> 28:43.166
Just don't do anything stupid, OK?

28:52.823 --> 28:55.186
Did you tell the other boys
not to give their DNA?

28:55.280 --> 28:56.395
You shouldn't be here.

28:56.561 --> 28:57.914
Did you?
-No.

28:57.959 --> 28:59.958
Then why have they changed their minds?

29:00.073 --> 29:01.834
Why have you changed yours?

29:03.371 --> 29:04.686
Is it your father?

29:04.727 --> 29:05.931
No.

29:05.967 --> 29:07.659
What's going on, Sean?

29:08.479 --> 29:09.705
Let go of the door.

29:09.778 --> 29:11.364
You don't need your father's permission

29:11.389 --> 29:12.628
to give a DNA sample.

29:12.653 --> 29:15.452
You can go to the police yourself.
-Let go.

29:15.673 --> 29:18.045
I just want to find out
what happened to Rhys.

29:18.087 --> 29:19.717
He hit his head, you said so yourself.

29:19.742 --> 29:24.903
Yes, but I know that someone
else was with him when he died.

29:25.090 --> 29:27.438
And I wanna find out who that was.

29:28.407 --> 29:29.839
I thought he was your friend?

29:29.946 --> 29:31.545
He was.

29:31.646 --> 29:33.951
Then surely you'd want
to know what happened?

29:35.393 --> 29:37.833
No. I don't. I don't want to know.

30:03.293 --> 30:07.452
Hi. Fern. Don't go. It's fine.

30:07.780 --> 30:11.469
Hi. I'm Soroya...
-I know who you are.

30:12.533 --> 30:15.001
You're the cop that found Robert's car.

30:16.147 --> 30:17.496
Yeah.

30:17.527 --> 30:19.522
Hey, can I ask you something, Fern?

30:19.660 --> 30:21.139
Your Mum and Robert,

30:21.709 --> 30:24.406
were things OK between
them, towards the end?

30:25.126 --> 30:26.393
What do you mean?

30:26.625 --> 30:29.206
Did they ever argue, or...?
How bad did it get?

30:29.275 --> 30:30.928
I wasn't at home. I wouldn't know.

30:31.095 --> 30:32.766
Fern, do you know if...?

30:32.913 --> 30:35.833
Do you know if things ever
got physical between them?

30:38.887 --> 30:41.287
You think my mum killed Robert.

30:42.658 --> 30:44.167
No, Fern.

30:45.687 --> 30:47.592
You don't have to go.

30:51.566 --> 30:53.006
Hello?

30:53.727 --> 30:55.303
You have to check in on Mum.

30:55.791 --> 30:57.578
The cops think she killed Robert.

30:57.678 --> 31:00.886
What? Why? What's going on?

31:01.140 --> 31:02.500
Fern.

31:20.447 --> 31:22.745
Where's Nichols? Is he inside?

31:23.330 --> 31:24.801
Is Nichols in there?
I need to know what's going on.

31:24.825 --> 31:26.258
I'm sorry, Doctor.
-My ex-wife is in there.

31:26.282 --> 31:27.521
Sir.
-I want to see her.

31:27.546 --> 31:29.065
If you don't leave the property,

31:29.090 --> 31:31.010
we'll have no choice but to detain you.

31:40.204 --> 31:42.388
I don't think you should answer that.

31:42.751 --> 31:45.692
Soroya Dass told you, didn't she?
-Why didn't you tell us?

31:45.717 --> 31:47.396
Because it's nobody's bloody business.

31:47.638 --> 31:49.717
Where did you get it, Steph?

31:50.351 --> 31:51.729
Where do you think?

31:51.765 --> 31:53.383
From Robert.
-When?

31:53.492 --> 31:55.380
How? I mean, come on, Steph.

31:55.405 --> 31:58.484
We can do this down at
the station if you want.

31:58.925 --> 32:01.004
I found it in my letterbox.

32:01.144 --> 32:02.623
OK. When?

32:02.951 --> 32:04.631
I don't remember.

32:05.151 --> 32:06.430
Did you see who put it there?

32:06.481 --> 32:08.295
No, but who else would
have put it there?

32:08.351 --> 32:09.750
Can you give me a date?

32:09.898 --> 32:12.217
No, because I didn't diarise it, Bryan.

32:12.298 --> 32:15.318
Steph, where you on the
3rd of October last year?

32:15.543 --> 32:17.653
That was a Tuesday night.
-Why?

32:17.785 --> 32:20.202
Just answer the question.
-I don't remember.

32:21.217 --> 32:23.529
Did you ever damage the
tyres on Robert's car?

32:23.554 --> 32:24.909
No.

32:25.016 --> 32:27.008
Did you ever have cause
to threaten him?

32:27.190 --> 32:29.161
Christ, did I threaten him?

32:29.192 --> 32:31.747
Yeah, maybe. I don't
know. I don't remember.

32:31.796 --> 32:33.417
Steph, you're gonna have
to give me something.

32:33.476 --> 32:35.728
Why? Are you gonna
arrest me for murder?

32:42.016 --> 32:45.335
You know what Robert put me
through. You know what he was...

32:45.929 --> 32:49.128
Bryan, I did not slash his tyres.

32:49.229 --> 32:51.388
I did not steal his ring.

32:51.449 --> 32:52.951
I did not put him in the river.

32:53.003 --> 32:56.443
I did not kill him.

33:03.243 --> 33:05.402
Steph. What happened?

33:05.523 --> 33:07.827
Where are you?
-At home.

33:08.357 --> 33:11.156
Why were the police
searching your house?

33:11.243 --> 33:13.514
Think you should ask your girlfriend.

33:26.970 --> 33:28.250
Hey.

33:31.116 --> 33:32.833
What did you tell them?

33:32.983 --> 33:33.983
What?

33:34.057 --> 33:36.935
The cops raided Steph's house.

33:37.090 --> 33:39.853
She said it was on your recommendation.

33:40.776 --> 33:43.434
Daniel...
-What did you tell them?

33:43.870 --> 33:46.931
She had Robert Quinn's
wedding ring at her house.

33:49.477 --> 33:52.519
And what? That makes her a criminal?

33:53.936 --> 33:55.495
I thought you liked her.

33:55.520 --> 33:57.800
I do. I do like her.

34:00.570 --> 34:02.410
I think you'd better go.

34:39.795 --> 34:41.395
You OK?

34:41.570 --> 34:42.803
I'm fine.

34:42.917 --> 34:44.516
You don't look fine.

34:45.397 --> 34:48.835
Why are you here at work?
You should be with David.

34:48.929 --> 34:52.351
I pushed through the DNA samples
on the seminal fluid we found.

34:54.322 --> 34:55.690
And?

34:56.250 --> 34:58.945
You pulled an all-nighter
to get these markers?

35:00.464 --> 35:01.983
I should have told you,

35:02.057 --> 35:04.176
all the boys have refused
to give samples.

35:04.729 --> 35:07.183
Sorry.
-You're kidding.

35:08.597 --> 35:10.357
Why the change of heart?

35:11.333 --> 35:14.572
I think Sean Paulson's father
talked them out of it.

35:14.903 --> 35:17.303
Alright, so where do we go from here?

35:21.603 --> 35:23.962
Is this from Police Scientific?
-Yeah.

35:24.203 --> 35:26.099
Yeah, there's nothing
unusual on Rhys's clothes.

35:26.190 --> 35:28.669
It's just algae, dirt and
saltwater from the river.

35:30.637 --> 35:31.884
What?

35:31.997 --> 35:34.590
Do we have the results
of Rhys's head wound?

35:35.317 --> 35:36.636
Yeah.

35:36.885 --> 35:38.236
Here.

35:38.583 --> 35:41.728
There's no traces of algae
in his skull tissue.

35:42.990 --> 35:44.829
Right, so...

35:45.830 --> 35:47.452
The ramp was covered in the stuff.

35:47.477 --> 35:50.130
It was all over his clothes,
but none in his wound.

35:51.363 --> 35:53.333
Let's shave his head and get a cast

35:53.358 --> 35:55.267
made of the back of his skull.

35:57.975 --> 35:59.356
Watch your step.

35:59.422 --> 36:00.749
Algae.

36:00.844 --> 36:02.324
Is this where he hit his head?

36:03.537 --> 36:05.456
This is where the police think.

36:05.523 --> 36:07.643
Have you got the cast?
-Yeah.

36:18.323 --> 36:21.003
This isn't the edge that
fractured his skull.

36:21.750 --> 36:23.390
It doesn't match. Look.

36:27.050 --> 36:28.710
This isn't where he fell.

36:29.550 --> 36:32.550
So if he didn't hit his
head here, then where?

36:40.077 --> 36:41.517
It's a match.

36:47.736 --> 36:50.816
What are you doing? You need to leave.

36:52.617 --> 36:56.411
Rhys was here the other night,
wasn't he, after the party?

36:56.884 --> 36:58.464
You said he left early.

36:58.517 --> 37:00.437
But you did too, right?

37:10.963 --> 37:12.882
Then he drove you home.

37:13.403 --> 37:15.283
Was he your boyfriend?

37:15.983 --> 37:17.869
Or was it your first time?

37:25.443 --> 37:27.203
He gave you oral sex.

37:30.003 --> 37:32.768
And then Rhys began to choke.

37:39.129 --> 37:40.503
What's wrong?

37:41.877 --> 37:44.433
Rhys didn't hit his
head on that boat ramp.

37:45.383 --> 37:46.910
It happened here, didn't it?

37:46.976 --> 37:50.464
The grass was wet yesterday,
someone had washed away his blood.

37:51.304 --> 37:53.863
Look, you don't have to lie anymore.

37:54.497 --> 37:57.783
If it was an accident, it's
not too late to admit it.

37:57.930 --> 38:01.079
So please, Sean, tell me.

38:01.423 --> 38:04.048
How did Rhys fall? Did he trip?

38:05.877 --> 38:07.129
Get back inside.

38:07.190 --> 38:09.063
And, you, get off my
property or I'll call the police.

38:09.088 --> 38:11.327
I think you should.
-Inside, Sean. Now.

38:11.911 --> 38:13.036
No.

38:13.061 --> 38:14.276
Get inside.

38:14.303 --> 38:15.463
No.

38:18.963 --> 38:20.783
You knew, didn't you?

38:21.243 --> 38:24.443
What's wrong? Hey, hey, hey, hey.

38:24.510 --> 38:26.511
Because you caught them together.

38:29.144 --> 38:30.932
Inside, Sean, now.
-It's too late, Dad.

38:30.957 --> 38:32.541
They know.
-They don't know anything.

38:32.624 --> 38:34.664
They need to.
-Shut up.

38:37.764 --> 38:39.476
You're right.

38:40.783 --> 38:42.263
Dad caught us.

38:43.790 --> 38:46.110
He was so angry.

38:48.561 --> 38:50.431
You just pushed him.

38:50.683 --> 38:52.290
I told you to leave.

38:54.256 --> 38:57.569
He was dying and we
could have saved him.

38:57.671 --> 38:59.203
We could have called an ambulance.

38:59.310 --> 39:02.510
But you made us stand there
and just watch him die.

39:05.758 --> 39:08.072
He's lying. He... he's very upset.

39:08.097 --> 39:10.518
Then you made me go with
you to the rowing shed.

39:10.550 --> 39:12.709
Sean, come on.
-We dumped his body...

39:12.870 --> 39:14.509
Hurry up.

39:14.603 --> 39:16.563
Get in the backseat and get his feet.

39:17.543 --> 39:19.138
I wanted to tell you the other day,

39:19.183 --> 39:22.700
but you still wouldn't
let the truth come out.

39:22.764 --> 39:24.843
Because it's not true.

39:24.903 --> 39:26.692
OK, that other boy was
gay, but you're not.

39:26.717 --> 39:28.185
I am, Dad.
-You're not.

39:28.210 --> 39:29.729
This is his fault.

39:30.273 --> 39:31.930
OK, I warned him to stay away from you.

39:31.955 --> 39:33.794
I told him not to go anywhere near you.

39:33.819 --> 39:35.407
You wrote that note.

39:35.493 --> 39:38.244
Hey. Hey, don't you
touch him. Let him go.

39:41.270 --> 39:42.570
Shit.

40:44.223 --> 40:46.342
You had trouble at
school, too, didn't you?

40:46.417 --> 40:47.653
Yeah.

40:47.744 --> 40:48.881
And you know what?

40:48.906 --> 40:50.481
I always thought a kid like Rhys

40:50.506 --> 40:52.718
would have had it easier than I did.

40:53.110 --> 40:55.072
But I guess the world
hasn't changed as much

40:55.097 --> 40:56.950
as we'd like to think it has.

40:57.304 --> 41:00.223
Look, Julian deserved
what he got today.

41:00.390 --> 41:02.399
But you don't want to turn out like me.

41:03.030 --> 41:05.149
No, I don't.

41:05.344 --> 41:07.904
But I'm not going to stop caring.

41:08.670 --> 41:10.562
I want you to take the night off.

41:12.063 --> 41:15.625
Take Gregory and drive
up the coast with David.

41:16.683 --> 41:20.203
You're giving me the Fiat?
-I'm loaning you the Fiat.

41:22.064 --> 41:24.327
Go on, quick, before
I change my mind.

41:26.503 --> 41:28.632
Hey, you know, this is
a really great incentive

41:28.657 --> 41:30.318
for me to get my manual licence.

41:30.791 --> 41:32.726
What? Wait.

41:32.917 --> 41:34.237
Simon.

41:36.544 --> 41:40.824
Steph. Steph.
-Please don't touch me.

41:40.970 --> 41:42.767
Steph, look, I know

41:42.792 --> 41:44.954
that you're not very happy
with me right now...

41:46.084 --> 41:48.375
but if there is anything that
you're keeping from the police,

41:48.460 --> 41:51.820
anything at all, you have to tell them.

41:53.437 --> 41:55.809
Steph, they think you did it.

41:56.061 --> 41:58.055
They think you killed Robert.

41:58.197 --> 42:00.756
They're looking for
anything to pin this on you

42:01.085 --> 42:02.679
and they're finding it.

42:02.750 --> 42:05.429
Look, if there's anything
you're not telling us,

42:05.650 --> 42:07.290
now's the time.

42:27.263 --> 42:30.303
Steph, what can I do for you?

42:35.664 --> 42:37.786
You wanted to see me?

42:38.183 --> 42:40.206
Yeah. Take a seat.

42:47.917 --> 42:49.676
What night was this?

42:49.877 --> 42:51.612
3rd of October last year.

42:51.730 --> 42:53.729
Same night Quinn's car
was driven into the dam.

42:53.783 --> 42:57.580
Yeah. Steph admitted herself into
hospital at 2pm that afternoon

42:57.605 --> 42:59.913
and wasn't discharged
till later the following day.

42:59.997 --> 43:01.570
Did she say what she was in for?

43:01.669 --> 43:03.709
She said she fell down the stairs.

43:04.077 --> 43:06.152
Hospital confirmed a fractured rib.

43:06.290 --> 43:09.050
So she didn't drive
Quinn's car into the dam.

43:09.950 --> 43:11.150
No.

43:11.438 --> 43:13.685
But that means we are
back to square one.

43:35.557 --> 43:38.396
Steph has an alibi for the
night Quinn went missing.

43:38.796 --> 43:41.163
Turns out she was in hospital.
-For what?

43:41.323 --> 43:42.595
Fractured rib.

43:42.721 --> 43:46.484
She's no longer a suspect. I
just thought you should know.

43:46.590 --> 43:48.510
What about the ring?

43:50.224 --> 43:52.611
The divers found a skull.

43:55.144 --> 43:56.870
It's Quinn's.

44:04.163 --> 44:07.670
That's you, who did that.

44:09.696 --> 44:11.424
You found his car.

44:13.370 --> 44:15.610
You found his phone.

44:17.964 --> 44:21.123
You forced them to dive more.

44:21.415 --> 44:22.975
That was all you.

44:24.511 --> 44:26.311
Sorry.

44:36.497 --> 44:38.407
Yep?

44:38.432 --> 44:39.835
Well...

44:39.897 --> 44:43.136
I just wanted to speak
with Max about...

44:43.398 --> 44:44.725
No, I get it.

44:44.768 --> 44:46.264
Geneva?

44:46.757 --> 44:49.277
Your secret is safe with me.

44:51.744 --> 44:53.784
Right. Yeah.

44:55.077 --> 44:57.357
Tremendous.

45:00.897 --> 45:02.176
Why are we out here?

45:02.257 --> 45:04.005
Well, it's just a little
bit more private.

45:04.030 --> 45:05.567
It's going to rain.

45:06.800 --> 45:09.100
What is so important?

45:09.517 --> 45:11.133
Geneva?

45:11.923 --> 45:14.480
Who told you? Was it Lyle?
I'm going to throttle him.

45:14.505 --> 45:16.199
Why didn't you tell me, Max?

45:16.317 --> 45:18.559
Because I haven't made a decision yet.

45:18.624 --> 45:20.479
What, and you didn't think you
should discuss it with me?

45:20.503 --> 45:24.245
Well, I just... I didn't... I
didn't want to complicate things.

45:24.270 --> 45:26.749
Alright, well, that worked out well.

45:27.004 --> 45:28.843
So, what are you thinking?

45:29.130 --> 45:30.890
Are you gonna take it?

45:31.711 --> 45:34.419
I told you, I... I don't know.

45:36.270 --> 45:37.988
I... I don't want you to go.
-Bryan...

45:38.013 --> 45:39.635
No, and I've been thinking...

45:41.136 --> 45:42.716
And this might seem a bit sudden,

45:42.741 --> 45:44.929
but I reckon we should get married.

45:47.630 --> 45:48.925
Married?

45:49.344 --> 45:50.595
Yeah.

45:50.723 --> 45:52.042
Why not?

45:52.163 --> 45:53.902
No, Max, I'm serious.

45:54.896 --> 45:57.456
I want you to be my wife.

46:11.696 --> 46:13.175
She's got her mother's looks.

46:13.254 --> 46:15.419
And her father's personality.

46:15.470 --> 46:18.230
Don't wish that on her.

46:22.877 --> 46:24.770
Is that your father?

46:25.123 --> 46:29.224
No, that's Jack Twine, the
man who saved my life.

46:31.070 --> 46:34.390
I never told you how
my father died, did I?

46:35.531 --> 46:37.290
I was 14 years old,

46:37.517 --> 46:41.397
an exceptional student at
an exclusive private school.

46:42.804 --> 46:44.944
And one day I came home

46:45.544 --> 46:47.519
to find my father...

46:47.970 --> 46:50.970
had hung himself in the dining room.

46:53.798 --> 46:55.127
I didn't take it very well.

46:55.230 --> 46:57.269
I acted up at school, got kicked out.

46:57.397 --> 47:00.756
But the man that got me back on
the straight and narrow was Jack.

47:00.903 --> 47:04.553
He was the pathologist that
did my father's autopsy.

47:04.990 --> 47:06.473
And he took me under his wing,

47:06.537 --> 47:08.252
taught me everything I know,

47:08.556 --> 47:11.315
that whisky is for drinking,

47:11.384 --> 47:15.653
that rules are there
to be skirted around,

47:16.797 --> 47:19.557
and that the dead deserve respect.

47:20.863 --> 47:24.303
Even my father, who I'd been
angry at for a long time.

47:25.510 --> 47:28.236
So if it wasn't for Jack,
I don't think I'd be here.

47:30.309 --> 47:34.049
So he knows all your
deepest, darkest secrets.

47:34.270 --> 47:35.790
Every single one of them.

47:37.657 --> 47:39.257
What's in the fancy box?

47:40.344 --> 47:43.162
It's an antique surgeon's kit.

47:43.251 --> 47:48.403
A gift from Jack, from
when I got my doctorate.

47:49.283 --> 47:51.736
But enough with the
self-indulgent melancholy.

47:51.884 --> 47:54.532
More wine?
-Yeah, sure.

48:26.809 --> 48:29.123
We're all out of wine.

50:04.889 --> 50:06.448
This commendation means a lot.

50:06.473 --> 50:09.752
But even though it's my name
on the award, it isn't just for me.

50:10.030 --> 50:12.829
It's for all of us that
have worked tirelessly

50:12.877 --> 50:14.716
to get ice off the streets.

50:15.006 --> 50:17.045
The trust I put in my team.

50:17.877 --> 50:19.893
The trust they put in me.

50:20.997 --> 50:23.636
That's the real reason
that I'm up here today.

50:23.717 --> 50:25.517
Sarge.

50:27.042 --> 50:28.668
OK, September 27th.

50:28.730 --> 50:31.001
Yes, the night before Quinn
bought those new tyres.

50:36.837 --> 50:38.317
Yes.

50:41.336 --> 50:42.976
You've enlarged it?

50:59.050 --> 51:00.730
Fern Harrow.

51:04.843 --> 51:06.482
Next on Harrow...

51:06.510 --> 51:08.789
We are compiling evidence
for a charge of murder.

51:08.856 --> 51:10.444
She had some help.

51:10.937 --> 51:12.176
What do you want?

51:12.316 --> 51:13.795
I want to talk to Fern Harrow.

51:13.857 --> 51:15.649
Give her a call and
ask her to meet you.

51:15.723 --> 51:17.001
You think he was involved?

51:17.056 --> 51:20.255
Harrow is capable of stupid things.

51:20.504 --> 51:21.776
Would he hurt someone?

51:21.878 --> 51:23.465
The cops found his skull in the river.

51:23.530 --> 51:24.911
Was it you?

51:25.263 --> 51:27.742
Do you know if anyone
wanted to harm your father?

51:28.012 --> 51:29.958
In plain English, you
miserable old Jew.

51:29.983 --> 51:31.524
I don't think she wants your help.

51:31.549 --> 51:33.577
You think he killed
Wagner? A hate crime?

51:34.305 --> 51:40.777
