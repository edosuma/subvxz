getting me in trouble with my max but

18:59.679 --> 19:04.659
his dad's been in heaven a long time and

19:02.140 --> 19:06.190
max didn't talk to his dad for 10 years

19:04.659 --> 19:10.210
because he thought is that was no good

19:06.190 --> 19:12.730
but you listen to me there's nothing he

19:10.210 --> 19:15.490
regrets more in his life than that so

19:12.730 --> 19:17.890
you let that guy tag along you want this

19:15.490 --> 19:27.940
just for the recognition maybe you

19:17.890 --> 19:33.850
shouldn't be wearing that good soup

19:27.940 --> 19:36.399
you're not going to believe this lake

19:33.849 --> 19:37.719
fishing for makes fire six months ago

19:36.398 --> 19:39.339
that's enough to shut him down right

19:37.720 --> 19:40.960
there there's only one problem

19:39.339 --> 19:43.449
technically he's not fishing this is

19:40.960 --> 19:45.399
operation as an eco-tourist just doing

19:43.450 --> 19:49.028
my part to save the environment

19:45.398 --> 19:51.428
fishings not what it used to be fewer

19:49.028 --> 19:54.278
fish shorter seasons or boats

19:51.429 --> 19:56.559
competition out there is intense

19:54.278 --> 19:58.089
sometimes small operators like me or

19:56.558 --> 20:01.658
forced to get created just to make a

19:58.089 --> 20:02.500
living spirits rash now Blake and be

21:19.259 --> 21:22.829
I'm not saying it's right but it's a

21:20.759 --> 21:25.140
natural reaction people are scared they

hey Brian how did your dad get the name

22:07.269 --> 22:12.339
Buffalo my family always been the ocean

22:10.000 --> 22:13.809
people growing up my father spent much

22:12.339 --> 22:16.659
of his time in the ocean

22:13.809 --> 22:18.940
my grandma used to say he's so much like

22:16.660 --> 22:20.410
a water buffalo his friends heard it and

22:18.940 --> 22:23.440
it kind of stuck

22:20.410 --> 22:25.480
Ryan's father is a coon that's why for

22:23.440 --> 22:28.240
Chief of Police means well-respected

22:25.480 --> 22:29.860
teacher the water has got a lot of

22:28.240 --> 22:31.660
weight on the silent people listen he's

22:29.859 --> 22:45.159
exactly what we need to get laid off the

22:31.660 --> 22:47.950
water and Alba is not a hunter and over

22:45.160 --> 22:50.769
cool protects you and I work

22:47.950 --> 22:51.460
he's not an evil spirit is here for a

22:50.769 --> 22:52.930
reason

22:51.460 --> 22:56.049
now I understand you want me to respect

22:52.930 --> 22:57.920
nama cool and your beliefs but a man's

22:56.049 --> 23:02.299
leg has been mangled

22:57.920 --> 23:05.840
you know what money is as i understand

23:02.299 --> 23:08.930
it it's a life force under is everywhere

23:05.839 --> 23:12.980
amanda is here in here

23:08.930 --> 23:16.279
owner makes us strong I'll do my body

23:12.980 --> 23:18.680
and make sure said the balance

23:16.279 --> 23:21.079
I used to believe in that type of thing

23:18.680 --> 23:23.720
and then my son died so i asked you

23:21.079 --> 23:27.259
where's the balance in that no

23:23.720 --> 23:29.779
disrespect but there's no greater force

23:27.259 --> 23:32.089
that's controlling anyone or anything

23:29.779 --> 23:33.740
fact is if we don't put a stop to Blake

23:32.089 --> 23:35.659
people are gonna die

23:33.740 --> 23:37.759
the reason why you can't believe is

23:35.660 --> 23:41.180
because your mind is closed

23:37.759 --> 23:46.849
you should try to see it the Hawaiian

23:41.180 --> 23:47.570
way I wish I could thank you for your

23:46.849 --> 23:51.250
time

23:47.569 --> 23:54.908
gotta get back to work

23:51.250 --> 23:57.009
can we

23:54.909 --> 24:04.920
take a minute consider my father said

23:57.009 --> 24:07.019
when you two guys getting married

24:04.920 --> 24:18.150

24:20.579 --> 24:24.869

24:23.970 --> 24:26.339
