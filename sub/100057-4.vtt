♪ Ave ♪

00:03.961 --> 00:09.189
♪ Maria ♪

00:09.214 --> 00:10.246
Stop!

00:10.248 --> 00:12.215
Tenors, I need more volume.

00:12.217 --> 00:13.701
I can't hear you over the sound

00:13.726 --> 00:17.656
of Franz Schubert thrashing
and wailing in his grave.

00:19.039 --> 00:22.750
Franz Schubert is the composer
of "Ave Maria."

00:23.428 --> 00:25.304
And he's angry.

00:25.935 --> 00:27.101
Because you suck...

00:27.126 --> 00:28.882
- Oh.
- Oh, I get it!

00:28.907 --> 00:31.764
If my name was Franz,
I'd want to be dead, too.

00:31.789 --> 00:33.236
Excuse me.

00:33.238 --> 00:34.632
I think we sound good.

00:34.657 --> 00:36.328
Ha, "good"!

00:36.708 --> 00:40.014
The lonely chubby stepsister of "great."

00:40.039 --> 00:41.772
If we're gonna qualify for state,

00:41.774 --> 00:43.914
"good" is not gonna cut it.

00:44.143 --> 00:46.390
I'm calling an emergency
rehearsal for tomorrow.

00:46.415 --> 00:48.289
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Tomorrow?

00:48.314 --> 00:49.947
No can do, Artie-poo.

00:49.949 --> 00:51.851
Don't ever call me that. Why not?

00:51.876 --> 00:54.195
Because tomorrow is the first
day of deer-hunting season.

00:54.220 --> 00:56.821
It's sort of a unofficial
holiday in Kentucky.

00:56.823 --> 00:59.062
Everything shuts down, even the schools.

00:59.087 --> 01:02.103
And this is the first year Cash
is old enough to come with me.

01:02.128 --> 01:06.507
It's a classic rite of passage
where a boy becomes a man.

01:06.532 --> 01:09.933
Or as you may call it, a bar mitzvah.

01:10.113 --> 01:11.946
I'm not Jewish.

01:12.171 --> 01:14.238
Wait, bar mitzvah's a Jewish thing?

01:15.265 --> 01:17.198
I always thought it
was a New York thing.

01:17.223 --> 01:21.265
Normally I have a year
to prepare for a major competition.

01:21.290 --> 01:22.724
I will not be embarrassed.

01:22.749 --> 01:26.584
So you can kill your woodland
creatures after the Regionals.

01:26.586 --> 01:27.685
No.

01:27.687 --> 01:29.654
- No?
- No.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.023
Are you questioning my authority?

01:31.048 --> 01:33.182
I'm denying its existence.

01:33.207 --> 01:35.882
You have no leverage over me.

01:35.907 --> 01:37.106
I'm a volunteer,

01:37.131 --> 01:40.065
not some neurotic student who
signed up for freshman choir

01:40.090 --> 01:42.726
because I need the approval
of Angry Santa.

01:43.243 --> 01:45.056
Angry Santa. That's you.

01:45.081 --> 01:48.209
Where are you going? Rehearsal is
not over until I say it's over.

01:48.234 --> 01:49.774
Oh, no!

01:49.776 --> 01:52.043
Dr. Cochran's mad at me.

01:52.045 --> 01:53.562
If I get kicked out of glee club,

01:53.587 --> 01:55.854
I might have time to lose my virginity.

01:58.538 --> 02:01.372
I think of you more as
an angry Wolf Blitzer.

02:04.244 --> 02:05.576
Okay, rehearsal's over.

02:05.601 --> 02:06.835
Awesome, thanks.

02:17.804 --> 02:19.718
Okay, this is gonna help your dyslexia.

02:19.743 --> 02:23.218
Just use your finger and
write a word in the sand.

02:23.388 --> 02:24.854
Any word?

02:24.879 --> 02:27.093
Nothing that starts with an F.

02:27.981 --> 02:28.982
Or an S.

02:29.007 --> 02:30.820
You know what? Just write "butt."

02:31.611 --> 02:33.194
Do I have to do this, Mom?

02:33.219 --> 02:35.398
Dad says no one listens to Angry Santa.

02:35.423 --> 02:36.423
Cash!

02:36.448 --> 02:38.866
It's not my fault Adams hit
Arthur with a sick burn.

02:38.891 --> 02:40.796
It doesn't matter how sick the burn was,

02:40.821 --> 02:43.546
Dr. Cochran is helping you,
so you better do what he says.

02:43.571 --> 02:44.781
This is how it starts.

02:44.806 --> 02:47.078
One singer disrespects you,
it spreads through the choir.

02:47.103 --> 02:48.103
Next thing you know,

02:48.128 --> 02:50.056
you're taking flak from a
booger-eating ten-year-old.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.179
- 11-year-old.
- Do your work.

02:52.744 --> 02:55.125
Oh, uh, Ginny, I hate to be a bother,

02:55.150 --> 02:57.053
but I placed my order 20 minutes ago,

02:57.078 --> 02:59.609
and I know it doesn't take
that long to warm milk.

02:59.634 --> 03:01.934
Sorry, I'm just worried
about Arthur and Adams.

03:01.959 --> 03:03.292
Oh, yes.

03:03.317 --> 03:04.446
That was quite a showdown.

03:04.470 --> 03:08.038
Like, Helen Hunt versus
the tornado in that film,

03:08.063 --> 03:10.703
"Don't Make God Angry,
or He'll Throw a Cow at You."

03:11.124 --> 03:13.758
I just... I can't afford
to have Adams run him off.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.926
Tutors cost 50 bucks an hour,

03:15.928 --> 03:18.468
and I pay him in day-old biscuits.

03:22.778 --> 03:25.146
Is she the only waitress
working tonight?

03:25.171 --> 03:27.554
Look at you, working hard!

03:27.742 --> 03:28.765
That's nice.

03:28.790 --> 03:30.556
Hey, you know what else would be nice?

03:30.581 --> 03:32.859
You going easy on Arthur
so he doesn't quit.

03:32.884 --> 03:34.484
I don't know, just a thought.

03:34.509 --> 03:35.851
Please.

03:35.876 --> 03:38.176
That man thinks he can
come into this town

03:38.201 --> 03:39.427
and push me around?

03:39.853 --> 03:41.428
I did not get the cover of

03:41.453 --> 03:43.431
"Bluegrass Businesswoman Magazine"

03:43.456 --> 03:44.554
by being a pushover.

03:44.579 --> 03:46.154
I thought it was because you owned it.

03:46.179 --> 03:50.320
I did. I also own this diner
and the bourbon distillery.

03:50.345 --> 03:51.773
Yes, you are very important...

03:51.798 --> 03:52.812
Important?

03:56.853 --> 04:00.398
I am a pillar of this community.

04:00.423 --> 04:02.690
But that egomaniac is too busy

04:02.715 --> 04:05.921
throwing his résumé in my
face to pay me my due respect.

04:06.117 --> 04:07.244
You know what's funny?

04:07.246 --> 04:09.398
You two actually have
more in common than...

04:10.448 --> 04:13.304
You like respect, got it.

04:17.946 --> 04:21.481
Look at you, helping
my son overcome his challenges!

04:21.505 --> 04:22.679
That's nice!

04:22.704 --> 04:23.906
You know what else would be nice?

04:23.930 --> 04:26.398
You showing Adams some respect.

04:26.423 --> 04:27.704
I don't know, just a thought.

04:28.540 --> 04:30.781
That was a snort. Of derision.

04:30.806 --> 04:31.836
I'm just saying,

04:31.838 --> 04:34.738
show some appreciation
for her accomplishments.

04:34.740 --> 04:36.040
Ooh, I know!

04:36.042 --> 04:37.156
Get her to sign a cover

04:37.181 --> 04:39.328
of "Bluegrass Businesswoman
Magazine" for ya!

04:39.353 --> 04:42.557
Adams is like the toughest
guy in the prison yard.

04:42.582 --> 04:44.727
You don't go up to that guy
and ask him for an autograph.

04:44.751 --> 04:46.210
You punch him in the face.

04:46.235 --> 04:47.335
With a...

04:47.360 --> 04:49.107
fist full of respect?

04:49.132 --> 04:51.188
You know,
when I was teaching at Princeton...

04:51.190 --> 04:53.290
Mm, I was wondering when
you were gonna work that in.

04:53.292 --> 04:57.027
I had a problem with the
president of Princeton.

04:57.029 --> 04:59.196
- Mm.
- The Princeton president.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.257
I'm sorry, where?

05:00.282 --> 05:01.641
- Princeton, New Jersey.
- I can't hear you.

05:01.665 --> 05:02.774
- Princeton?
- I never heard of it.

05:02.798 --> 05:04.671
Anyway, I invited him on a quail hunt.

05:04.696 --> 05:06.595
I totally outshot him,

05:06.620 --> 05:08.320
and I never had a
problem with him again,

05:08.345 --> 05:10.946
and that is exactly what I'm
gonna do with Adams tomorrow.

05:10.971 --> 05:13.148
You know, it's one thing to
shoot birds with some nerd,

05:13.173 --> 05:15.640
but Adams was on the cover of
"Kentucky Huntress" magazine,

05:15.665 --> 05:16.875
and she doesn't own that one!

05:17.924 --> 05:19.275
This is gonna be a disaster.

05:19.300 --> 05:20.408
I...

05:21.364 --> 05:22.698
Who do I need to bless around here

05:22.722 --> 05:24.494

06:33.726 --> 06:37.817
and scratch ourselves and burp
and fart wherever we want.

06:37.842 --> 06:39.464
You're a lucky woman, Ginny.

06:39.489 --> 06:41.131
Oh, actually, we're getting divorced.

06:41.133 --> 06:42.676
That's what I meant.

06:42.709 --> 06:46.210
Hey, son, do you realize that
you are the seventh generation

06:46.235 --> 06:48.622
of Hawlings men to hunt in these woods?

06:48.647 --> 06:49.679
Check this out.

06:49.704 --> 06:50.937
That's me when I was your age

06:50.962 --> 06:53.184
with my daddy and my first kill.

06:53.784 --> 06:55.645
Did you get many likes?

06:56.335 --> 06:58.387
How did you get this
picture off your phone

06:58.412 --> 07:00.215
and on this raggedy piece of paper?

07:01.002 --> 07:02.330
Magic, son.

07:02.355 --> 07:04.426
- Magic.
- Sorry I'm late.

07:04.630 --> 07:07.164
Oh, looking snazzy, Arthur,

07:07.189 --> 07:09.289
like a distinguished Elmer Fudd.

07:09.314 --> 07:11.715
- What is he doing here?
- I'm going hunting with you.

07:11.747 --> 07:12.810
She didn't tell you I was coming?

07:12.834 --> 07:14.387
You didn't tell me he was coming.

07:14.412 --> 07:15.611
Surprise.

07:15.636 --> 07:17.934
Isn't it great? It's gonna be great.

07:17.959 --> 07:19.726
You guys get to spend some time together

07:19.751 --> 07:20.817
and get to know each other better,

07:20.841 --> 07:23.008
and, plus, I hear Arthur's
a really good hunter.

07:23.033 --> 07:25.628
No, I am an excellent hunter.

07:25.653 --> 07:28.606
Put the gun down, jackass.
It's bow-hunting season.

07:28.631 --> 07:31.481
And don't you dare get in my way.

07:31.506 --> 07:35.668
That's how people get hurt,
accidentally or otherwise.

07:39.015 --> 07:40.577
It's gonna be great!

07:43.060 --> 07:44.606
Remember what I told you, son.

07:44.817 --> 07:46.717
It's just like that
game "Big Buck Hunter,"

07:46.719 --> 07:49.086
except now you got a bow
and there's better graphics,

07:49.088 --> 07:51.722
and we're bonding in the woods...

07:51.747 --> 07:53.059
instead of a bar.

07:53.759 --> 07:55.792
Cool dog. What's his name?

07:55.817 --> 07:57.317
Name's Boone.

07:57.342 --> 07:59.976
He's gonna help me find a
special kind of mushroom

08:00.001 --> 08:02.434
that grows underground called a truffle.

08:02.723 --> 08:05.270
Wait, you're not hunting deer like us?

08:05.295 --> 08:07.796
No, no, I don't believe in
killing any living creature,

08:07.821 --> 08:11.242
especially something as beautiful
and majestic as a deer.

08:12.391 --> 08:15.030
Oh, uh, but I do believe

08:15.055 --> 08:17.522
in spending time in the
beautiful Kentucky woods

08:17.547 --> 08:19.047
- with my best friend.
- Yep.

08:19.171 --> 08:21.675
There's no one else
I'd rather be out here with.

08:21.677 --> 08:23.210
Except for Dale Earnhardt Jr.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.052
I think that dude would
be such a cool hang.

08:26.077 --> 08:27.077
Ooh.

08:27.710 --> 08:30.139
Now, you sure you know
how to use one of these?

08:30.164 --> 08:31.897
Yeah, how hard can it be?

08:37.764 --> 08:39.164
Right, right, right, right. Got it.

08:39.188 --> 08:40.962
I liked his way better.

08:41.297 --> 08:44.054
You know,
Adams is a really great hunter.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.024
Maybe she could give you a few pointers.

08:46.049 --> 08:47.416
Does he strike you as the type of man

08:47.440 --> 08:49.241
that likes to have a woman
explain things to him?

08:49.265 --> 08:51.865
I don't mind, if the woman
has the proper credentials.

08:51.907 --> 08:53.719
You want credentials?

08:54.049 --> 08:56.618
I was Miss Pulaski County, 19...

08:56.643 --> 09:00.291
And my talent was hitting
ten bull's-eyes in a row

09:00.316 --> 09:02.549
while singing "America the Beautiful"

09:02.551 --> 09:04.657
in an evening gown.

09:33.682 --> 09:37.032
You're entering these woods
a boy and coming out a man...

09:37.184 --> 09:38.641
just like Mulan.

09:38.666 --> 09:41.332
Uncle Dwayne,
I think Boone found a truffle!

09:41.357 --> 09:43.590
Well, I got my truffle
shovel right here.

09:43.592 --> 09:45.266
Hey, Cash, hey!

09:45.291 --> 09:46.724
Stop messing around.

09:46.749 --> 09:48.782
Deer hunting is serious business.

09:48.807 --> 09:50.107
Step one...

09:50.132 --> 09:52.501
We mask our scent with deer urine.

09:52.627 --> 09:55.391
The trick is to spray it into the air...

09:56.025 --> 09:57.524
and just walk through the cloud.

09:59.541 --> 10:01.374
Yeah, that's nature's cologne.

10:07.385 --> 10:09.285
So here's a fun one.

10:09.310 --> 10:12.679
What is your least favorite
album from your favorite band?

10:12.704 --> 10:14.798
Shh, shh, shh.
You'll scare off the deer.

10:14.823 --> 10:16.990
It's not sound that scares them off,
it's scent.

10:16.992 --> 10:20.585
Mine is "Dig In Deep"
by Miss Bonnie Raitt.

10:20.610 --> 10:21.955
Let's hope they don't catch a whiff

10:21.979 --> 10:25.040
of your overpowering male arrogance.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.374
Stand down, Cochran.

10:29.399 --> 10:30.899
This one's mine.

10:35.641 --> 10:38.575
♪ Oh, beautiful ♪

10:38.600 --> 10:41.568
♪ For spacious skies ♪

10:41.593 --> 10:44.694
♪ Sky... sky... sky... sky ♪

10:44.719 --> 10:46.554
Oh! Damn it!

10:47.615 --> 10:49.703
- You got in my head.
- Well, obviously not.

10:49.728 --> 10:51.140
If I was in your head,
you would've known

10:51.164 --> 10:52.703
how to hit that C-sharp.

11:07.436 --> 11:10.860
Yeah, boy. What a beaut.

11:11.001 --> 11:12.612
All right, son.

11:12.614 --> 11:13.847
This is your moment.

11:13.849 --> 11:15.515
Pull it back and let it rip.

11:15.517 --> 11:17.551
Or as our neighbor Big Pat says

11:17.553 --> 11:19.790
about our Christmas lights in April...

11:20.155 --> 11:21.954
take 'er down.

11:24.327 --> 11:25.392
I can't do it.

11:25.417 --> 11:26.618
Huh?

11:27.696 --> 11:28.728
What?

11:28.730 --> 11:29.796
Why not?

11:29.798 --> 11:30.868
Like Uncle Dwayne said,

11:30.893 --> 11:32.774
why would you kill a beautiful animal?

11:33.469 --> 11:35.798
Because the ugly ones
don't taste as good.

11:35.823 --> 11:37.815
But it's not fun to
hurt a living creature.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.706
And Uncle Dwayne said the
only thing a truffle hurts

11:39.708 --> 11:42.087
is your wallet when you're
trying to impress a date.

11:42.373 --> 11:44.246
I did say that.

11:44.271 --> 11:45.304
That's a fun one.

11:45.329 --> 11:46.813
What the hell, man?

11:46.815 --> 11:49.015
I merely explained

11:49.017 --> 11:50.817
the benefits of
gathering versus hunting.

11:50.819 --> 11:52.712
There's three things
every man should know...

11:52.737 --> 11:54.891
How to hunt, how to make a fire,

11:54.916 --> 11:56.516
and how to pretend he didn't notice

11:56.541 --> 11:58.469
a Whitney Houston song just came on.

11:58.494 --> 12:01.161
You think a boy like
Cash is ready to process

12:01.163 --> 12:02.662
"I Will Always Love You"?

12:02.664 --> 12:04.097
Just living my truth.

12:04.099 --> 12:05.599
But I'm sorry if that interferes

12:05.601 --> 12:07.234
with what you're trying
to teach your boy.

12:07.236 --> 12:09.493
You're setting a bad example for Cash.

12:09.866 --> 12:12.462
Cash? Cash? Hey!

12:12.896 --> 12:13.896
Cash!

12:17.089 --> 12:19.089
I know I say this a lot, but...

12:19.114 --> 12:20.665
Ginny's not gonna like this.

12:22.784 --> 12:25.352
First the choir, now hunting?

12:25.377 --> 12:28.244
Congratulations,
you've ruined two things I love.

12:28.269 --> 12:30.237
Come on, give me a third.
I'll go for the hat trick.

12:30.261 --> 12:33.128
Okay, I'm sensing a lot of mutual...

12:33.153 --> 12:34.786
respect here.

12:34.811 --> 12:36.977
I'm gonna go retrieve my arrow.

12:37.002 --> 12:39.403
And when I get back, I want you gone!

12:39.428 --> 12:40.735
You can't make me go!

12:40.760 --> 12:43.032
- You don't own the woods.
- Uh...

12:43.057 --> 12:44.890
just everything the light touches

12:44.915 --> 12:46.594
and the mineral rights below it.

12:46.619 --> 12:48.618
Yeah, I own the woods.

12:55.628 --> 12:58.720
Oh, look, a Yankee piñata.

12:59.540 --> 13:02.110
And it's filled with crushed nuts.

13:05.783 --> 13:09.390
You know, on the way home
we could swing by Arthur's.

13:09.415 --> 13:11.115
It's never too late to mend fences.

13:11.117 --> 13:13.517
I am not apologizing.

13:13.519 --> 13:15.407
That man ruined my streak.

13:15.432 --> 13:18.666
I have bagged a buck on
opening day every year

13:18.691 --> 13:20.519
since 19...

13:21.183 --> 13:22.203
Wait.

13:22.228 --> 13:24.161
What's Arthur's car still doing here?

13:24.163 --> 13:25.562
He left an hour ago.

13:25.564 --> 13:26.780
Damn it.

13:26.805 --> 13:29.633
That big-city bastard
went and got himself lost.

13:31.137 --> 13:32.636
Arthur!

13:34.065 --> 13:35.072
Arthur.

13:35.074 --> 13:36.974
- Arthur!
- Arthur?

13:37.212 --> 13:38.375
Don't shoot!

13:38.377 --> 13:40.280
I'm not a deer. I'm a choral conductor.

13:40.305 --> 13:41.837
I'm just a little lost.

13:42.173 --> 13:44.852
But I-I have friends nearby.

13:44.877 --> 13:46.071
Over here.

13:46.266 --> 13:47.365
Thank God!

13:47.720 --> 13:51.288
I was unceremoniously
dismissed from the deer stand.

13:51.313 --> 13:52.572
I'm trying to get back to the cars.

13:52.596 --> 13:53.696
You know where they are?

13:53.774 --> 13:55.421
I have no idea.

13:55.446 --> 13:56.727
You're lost, too?

13:56.729 --> 13:57.921
Well, Reverend Jax says

13:57.946 --> 14:00.110
you're never lost if you
have God in your heart.

14:00.328 --> 14:02.024
- So we're lost.
- Yeah.

14:02.654 --> 14:04.930
- Cash!
- Cash, hey!

14:04.955 --> 14:08.241
Where are you, son? Come on, buddy!

14:08.266 --> 14:09.884
Cash!

14:09.909 --> 14:11.251
Damn it!

14:12.078 --> 14:14.217
You ruined my first
hunting trip with my son.

14:14.242 --> 14:15.532
I'm his dad.

14:15.557 --> 14:18.001
I'm supposed to be the one
teaching him how to be a man!

14:18.026 --> 14:20.694
But there are many ways to
express your masculinity.

14:20.719 --> 14:22.519
Like my fist in your face.

14:22.521 --> 14:23.720
Let's go.

14:23.722 --> 14:25.470
Come on. Huh?

14:26.235 --> 14:27.235
Playground rules...

14:27.260 --> 14:30.610
No pantsing, no wedgies,
no purple nurples.

14:30.635 --> 14:31.662
All right?

14:31.664 --> 14:33.697
Now get on your knees
so it's a fair fight.

14:33.699 --> 14:34.832
Come on!

14:36.751 --> 14:38.569
Can we stop? I'm tired.

14:38.571 --> 14:40.516
Uh, why not?

14:41.407 --> 14:43.140
By the way, how did you get lost?

14:43.142 --> 14:44.842
I thought you were with your dad.

14:45.024 --> 14:46.310
I was, but I left

14:46.312 --> 14:48.078
when him and Uncle
Dwayne got in a fight.

14:48.434 --> 14:50.634
I can guess who won that one.

14:50.958 --> 14:53.327
I also got in a fight today with Adams.

14:53.352 --> 14:56.153
- I can guess who won that one.
- Actually, she did.

14:56.532 --> 14:58.679
Yeah. That was my guess.

14:58.704 --> 14:59.734
What? She's tough.

14:59.759 --> 15:02.159
I've never had a singer I
couldn't get to fall in line.

15:02.161 --> 15:03.877
Do you want me to put
in a good word for you?

15:03.901 --> 15:05.391
These dimples buy a lot of goodwill.

15:05.416 --> 15:06.423
Nah.

15:09.290 --> 15:10.304
Maybe.

15:10.329 --> 15:11.704
Arthur!

15:12.394 --> 15:13.726
Arthur!

15:13.751 --> 15:15.818
- We got to find him.
- Do we?

15:15.843 --> 15:17.495
A night in the woods changes a man,

15:17.520 --> 15:19.845
and God knows he can't get any worse.

15:20.407 --> 15:21.689
Okay.

15:21.907 --> 15:24.891
Now, I say this with love
and a little bit of fear,

15:24.916 --> 15:27.416
but the way you've been acting lately,

15:27.441 --> 15:30.126
you should be on the cover of
"Bluegrass Bitch" magazine!

15:31.905 --> 15:33.604
Excuse you?

15:33.669 --> 15:36.604
And excuse me for trying to protect you

15:36.629 --> 15:39.157
from a disrespectful blowhard
who only cares about himself.

15:39.182 --> 15:41.976
Now, that's not true.
He's real good with Cash.

15:42.001 --> 15:43.300
Of course he is!

15:43.302 --> 15:46.136
Only a monster could
resist those dimples.

15:46.381 --> 15:47.381
Well...

15:47.406 --> 15:49.172
And I know you were taking a shot at me,

15:49.174 --> 15:52.449
but I think there could be
a real market for "Bluegrass Bitch."

15:53.458 --> 15:55.057
Merchandise.

15:55.277 --> 15:57.358
Ball caps, theme song.

15:57.383 --> 15:58.582
Arthur!

15:58.584 --> 15:59.983
Come on, man.

15:59.985 --> 16:01.199
You're not mad at me.

16:01.224 --> 16:04.566
You mad at that prison
that is toxic masculinity.

16:04.591 --> 16:05.733
Shut up!

16:05.758 --> 16:09.120
Your gentle-giant
mumbo-jumbo is no match

16:09.145 --> 16:11.338
for my crazed adrenaline strength.

16:14.533 --> 16:15.628
What was that?

16:15.653 --> 16:17.655
I took an online course in aikido,

16:17.680 --> 16:20.391
the Japanese art of self-defense.

16:20.416 --> 16:23.183
I learned how to blend
with your attack...

16:24.510 --> 16:27.444
And contain your macho energy.

16:29.363 --> 16:31.081
- Feels good, doesn't it?
- No!

16:31.083 --> 16:32.267
They say for happiness,

16:32.292 --> 16:34.751
a person needs about
12 hugs a day, mm-hmm.

16:34.753 --> 16:35.919
Really? No!

16:35.921 --> 16:39.033
I will not give in to your strong,
reassuring warmth.

16:43.762 --> 16:44.828
There it is.

16:44.830 --> 16:46.103
Man...

16:46.884 --> 16:49.009
I just wanted this trip to go well.

16:50.442 --> 16:52.123
I already...

16:52.148 --> 16:54.048
failed Ginny as a husband.

16:54.073 --> 16:56.167
I can't fail Cash, too.

16:56.486 --> 16:59.175
You know,
I don't have kids of my own, but...

16:59.712 --> 17:01.167
I know that being a great dad

17:01.192 --> 17:04.159
means allowing your children
to follow their own path.

17:05.060 --> 17:06.933
You know who I learned that from?

17:07.720 --> 17:09.286
Mr. Rogers?

17:10.371 --> 17:12.704
- You.
- Yeah?

17:12.729 --> 17:14.675
You know, my dad never got me.

17:14.700 --> 17:17.259
Always picked on me
because I wouldn't hunt,

17:17.284 --> 17:19.199
play football, or fight.

17:19.720 --> 17:23.032
You were the only
person who accepted me.

17:24.645 --> 17:26.946
And I know you can do the same for Cash.

17:35.784 --> 17:37.058
Thanks, man.

17:37.083 --> 17:38.581
Anytime, buddy.

17:39.560 --> 17:40.792
Guys?

17:40.817 --> 17:42.784
What's going on?

17:43.385 --> 17:45.167
Progress, Ginny.

17:45.331 --> 17:46.734
Progress.

17:46.759 --> 17:48.261
Where's Cash?

17:48.772 --> 17:51.206
Oh, yeah, uh, well, we kind of lost him,

17:51.231 --> 17:54.128
- but, uh, we searched all over...
- You lost Cash?

17:54.293 --> 17:56.127
What the crap, Wayne?

17:56.152 --> 17:57.184
Cash!

17:57.209 --> 17:58.545
- Cash!
- Cash!

17:58.570 --> 17:59.589
Cash!

17:59.614 --> 18:01.581
Yep, I told you she
wasn't going to like that.

18:01.606 --> 18:02.916
Yeah, at least it'll be easier

18:02.941 --> 18:04.841
than that time you lost
him in a corn maze.

18:04.843 --> 18:07.331
Yeah, that was a long Labor Day weekend.

18:08.120 --> 18:10.941
Maybe this is a sign I should
move back to New York.

18:10.966 --> 18:12.604
At least there,
somebody would've found us

18:12.628 --> 18:13.808
and mugged us by now.

18:13.833 --> 18:15.566
Hey, Huckleberry Finn.

18:15.698 --> 18:17.232
Careful where you're poking your stick.

18:17.256 --> 18:18.823
There might be something
living in there.

18:18.847 --> 18:21.091
Yeah, like a truffle!

18:22.404 --> 18:24.566
Uh, truffles don't move, do they?

18:25.170 --> 18:27.400
Cash, get back! It might be a snake!

18:27.425 --> 18:28.550
Oh.

18:29.201 --> 18:30.314
Oh.

18:30.339 --> 18:32.536
- Cash!
- Come on out, buddy!

18:32.538 --> 18:33.589
Cash!

18:33.909 --> 18:36.034
- Cash!
- Cash!

18:40.668 --> 18:42.963
Oh, my God, Cash!

18:43.464 --> 18:44.955
Honey, are you okay?

18:44.957 --> 18:46.284
Yeah, we heard a scream.

18:46.309 --> 18:47.341
That wasn't me.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.062
Yeah, look who's the soprano now.

18:52.064 --> 18:53.683
It's called a head voice.

18:54.010 --> 18:55.777
I was poking my stick at an animal,

18:55.802 --> 18:58.316
and it got mad, but Arthur protected me.

18:58.699 --> 19:01.949
What kind of an... Oh,
good Lord, that's a skunk.

19:01.974 --> 19:04.230
Ooh, let's get the H-E
double-hockey-sticks out of here.

19:04.471 --> 19:06.505
It got me in the... in the eyes.

19:06.530 --> 19:08.163
It's not as bad as it seems.

19:08.188 --> 19:11.519
It's just an oily compound they
spray from their anal glands.

19:12.116 --> 19:13.849
Which... what?

19:18.525 --> 19:20.701
Oh, how's that stew coming?

19:20.726 --> 19:22.826
I'm sorry no one killed a deer today.

19:22.828 --> 19:23.994
Actually, I love deer,

19:23.996 --> 19:25.129
and I don't wish to see them harmed,

19:25.153 --> 19:26.761
so in the words of
the great Demi Lovato,

19:26.786 --> 19:28.425
"Sorry, not sorry."

19:28.450 --> 19:30.855
The men are back from hunting...

19:30.880 --> 19:32.730
- Ooh.
- And we bring you...

19:32.755 --> 19:34.470
Mushrooms!

19:34.495 --> 19:36.150
Which aren't as fancy as truffles,

19:36.175 --> 19:37.341
but they're easier to find.

19:37.343 --> 19:40.589
- I am so proud of you, baby!
- That boy's a natural.

19:40.614 --> 19:41.941
Hey, Ginny, get a picture.

19:41.966 --> 19:44.135
I want to commemorate
our first hunt together.

19:44.160 --> 19:45.831
Oh, first of many, I bet.

19:45.856 --> 19:48.690
- Say "truffles."
- Truffles!

19:49.021 --> 19:50.058
All right, Dwayne.

19:50.083 --> 19:52.733
Clean 'em up,
and let's throw 'em in that stew.

19:52.758 --> 19:54.525
Uh, okay.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.859
Edible...

19:55.861 --> 19:57.542
poisonous...

19:57.567 --> 20:00.566
extremely hallucinogenic.

20:02.136 --> 20:03.534
Okay...

20:06.224 --> 20:09.083
You know,
I've performed baptisms in that tub,

20:09.108 --> 20:10.636
and tomato juice is mostly water,

20:10.661 --> 20:12.933
- so if you wanted to convert...
- Get away from me.

20:12.958 --> 20:15.105
Not the right time.
I completely understand.

20:17.459 --> 20:19.159
Are you here to gloat?

20:19.184 --> 20:21.675
No, I'm bringing a peace offering.

20:21.700 --> 20:24.324
Vodka to go with your tomato juice.

20:24.349 --> 20:26.249
I call it a "Bloody Arthur."

20:26.274 --> 20:27.434
Feels like gloating.

20:27.459 --> 20:29.652
I still think you're arrogant and rude,

20:29.677 --> 20:31.010
unnecessarily pretentious,

20:31.035 --> 20:33.613
couldn't hit a deer with your car.

20:33.638 --> 20:35.284
I'm waiting for a "but."

20:35.309 --> 20:37.175
You're always interrupting people.

20:37.433 --> 20:39.033
However...

20:39.058 --> 20:41.225
you're good for Cash, and who knows?

20:41.250 --> 20:43.450
Maybe you'll be good for
the rest of us, too.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.308
So, from now on,

20:45.333 --> 20:47.967
I will allow you to lead the choir.

20:47.992 --> 20:50.511
Because I am the choir leader?

20:50.536 --> 20:52.777
Because I allowed it.

20:54.330 --> 20:55.330
Deal.

20:55.869 --> 20:57.585
The vittles are ready!

20:57.610 --> 20:59.593
"Vittles" is a Southern word for "food."

20:59.618 --> 21:01.500
Yeah, I've seen
"The Beverly Hillbillies."

21:01.525 --> 21:03.351
Or as my missionary parents called it,

21:03.376 --> 21:06.062
"You Think They're Rich,
You Should See The Mansions In Heaven."

21:08.086 --> 21:09.546
Needs olives.

21:09.571 --> 21:11.851
I see a couple of
little olives right there.

21:18.565 --> 21:19.664
You wish.

21:19.689 --> 21:24.346
