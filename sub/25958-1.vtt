THERE ARE DRINKS INSIDE

01:52.494 --> 01:54.326
AND PLENTY OF FOOD
FOR EVERYONE.

01:54.395 --> 01:55.595
LEAVE IT TO LARRY

01:55.630 --> 01:57.797
TO INSIST ON BLACK TIE
FOR HIS BIRTHDAY PARTY.

01:57.832 --> 01:59.832
HE'S PROBABLY SPENDING
A FORTUNE.

01:59.901 --> 02:01.868
DAD, THIS IS NOT
THE PLACE.

02:01.903 --> 02:03.235
-[LARRY]: PETER?
-[PETER]: YEAH?

02:03.304 --> 02:05.270
-HELP THEM.
-SURE. FOLLOW ME.

02:05.306 --> 02:06.739
AND HE'S GOT PETER HARRELL
DOING THE CATERING?

02:08.509 --> 02:09.709
IT'S LIKE HE'S
SPITTING IN OUR EYE.

02:09.744 --> 02:10.675
OKAY, JUST STAY CALM.

02:10.711 --> 02:12.778
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.

02:12.814 --> 02:14.046
[LARRY]: TESS!

02:14.081 --> 02:15.381
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:15.416 --> 02:17.316
LARRY!
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

02:17.351 --> 02:18.651
WALTER,

02:18.720 --> 02:19.752
GLAD YOU COULD MAKE IT.

02:19.787 --> 02:21.020
IT WASN'T EASY.

02:21.055 --> 02:21.988
YOU KNOW WE HATE
TO TAKE TIME AWAY

02:22.023 --> 02:22.955
FROM THE RESTAURANT,

02:22.991 --> 02:24.356
ESPECIALLY NOW.

02:24.392 --> 02:26.626
I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE UPSET,

02:26.661 --> 02:27.693
BUT IF YOU COULD GIVE ME
SOME TIME,

02:27.729 --> 02:28.928
I'LL BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN...

02:28.963 --> 02:31.230
HEY, CAN I
GET A PHOTO?

02:31.265 --> 02:32.197
STAND TOGETHER.

02:32.233 --> 02:34.266
ONE, TWO, THREE.

02:34.301 --> 02:36.368
MAKE SURE YOU
GET MY GOOD SIDE.

02:37.705 --> 02:38.638
DO YOU HAVE A BAD ONE?

02:39.674 --> 02:41.306
THANKS, GUYS.

02:43.845 --> 02:46.278
THE RESTAURANT
HAS SOME BILLS COMING DUE.

02:46.313 --> 02:47.479
YOU HAVEN'T PAID
YOUR SHARE.

02:47.549 --> 02:49.248
WE NEED THAT MONEY,
LARRY.

02:49.316 --> 02:50.616
WALTER, I SWEAR,

02:50.652 --> 02:52.752
AS SOON
AS I FIGURE THINGS OUT...

02:52.787 --> 02:53.619
MIND IF I BORROW
MY FAVORITE CLIENT

02:53.688 --> 02:54.654
FOR A MOMENT?

02:54.689 --> 02:57.289
[LARRY]:
GO ON, ENJOY YOURSELF.

02:57.324 --> 02:58.591
EVERYTHING WILL BE OKAY.

02:58.626 --> 02:59.525
I PROMISE.

03:04.732 --> 03:06.599
IT'S A PARTY,
REMEMBER.

03:06.668 --> 03:09.501
LET'S AVOID ANY
UNPLEASANT CONVERSATION.

03:09.571 --> 03:10.703
WALLY'S MY FRIEND.

03:10.738 --> 03:12.371
I OWE HIM
AN EXPLANATION.

03:12.406 --> 03:14.640
WELL, HE'S NOT LOOKING
FOR AN EXPLANATION.

03:14.676 --> 03:16.442
HE'S LOOKING FOR A FIGHT.

03:16.477 --> 03:17.610
REMEMBER, I WARNED YOU

03:17.679 --> 03:19.344
AGAINST INVESTING
IN YOUR FRIENDS' PROJECTS.

03:19.380 --> 03:21.213
EASIER SAID THAN DONE.

03:21.248 --> 03:22.514
DID YOU BRING THOSE DOCUMENTS
I ASKED FOR?

03:22.550 --> 03:23.716
AH, YES.

03:23.751 --> 03:25.551
I'M HAVING MY SECRETARY
PULL ALL THE OLD FILES.

03:25.620 --> 03:26.485
WE'LL HAVE
SOMETHING FOR YOU

03:26.520 --> 03:27.653
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

03:27.722 --> 03:28.921
I'M SORRY,
BUT I CAN'T STAY.

03:28.957 --> 03:30.222
YOU'RE LEAVING?

03:30.291 --> 03:31.523
YEAH, WELL...

03:31.593 --> 03:32.625
YOU MAY BE
MY FAVORITE CLIENT,

03:32.660 --> 03:33.593
BUT YOU'RE NOT
MY ONLY ONE.

03:33.628 --> 03:36.696
MY ADVICE,
AS YOUR ATTORNEY...

03:36.731 --> 03:38.263
FOCUS ON YOUR BIRTHDAY.

03:38.299 --> 03:40.199
THE PAPERWORK

03:41.903 --> 03:43.736
HEY, UNCLE LARRY.

03:45.773 --> 03:46.872
TONY.

03:46.908 --> 03:47.807
SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE.

03:50.011 --> 03:50.943
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR DAD YET.

03:50.979 --> 03:52.411
YEAH, NO, UH...

03:52.480 --> 03:53.613
HE COULDN'T MAKE IT.

03:53.648 --> 03:54.947

HEY, GATHER UP.

03:54.983 --> 03:55.982
WE'RE GETTING
EVERYONE TOGETHER

03:56.050 --> 03:57.717
FOR A GROUP SHOT.

03:57.752 --> 03:58.818
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR BOW TIE?

04:00.922 --> 04:02.454
I MUST HAVE FORGOT IT INSIDE.

04:02.523 --> 04:03.689
DON'T TAKE ANY PICTURES
WITHOUT ME.

04:03.725 --> 04:05.390
OKAY.

04:05.459 --> 04:06.525
CAN I GET EVERYONE
TO STAND HERE?

04:06.594 --> 04:07.459
WE'RE GOING
TO GET A GROUP SHOT

04:07.495 --> 04:08.694

04:31.119 --> 04:31.951
[SHUTTER CLICKING]

04:57.311 --> 04:58.477
OKAY, GUYS, STAY PUT.

04:58.512 --> 04:59.611
I'M GOING TO RUSTLE
MR. BRADY OUT HERE, OKAY?

04:59.647 --> 05:01.047
ONE SEC.

05:03.517 --> 05:04.850
MR. BRADY?

05:04.886 --> 05:06.552
WE'RE WAITING.

05:06.587 --> 05:08.721
LARRY?

05:10.457 --> 05:11.557
LARRY?

05:14.195 --> 05:15.427
LARRY?

05:17.899 --> 05:19.732
LARRY!

05:19.801 --> 05:21.834
SOMEBODY CALL AN AMBULANCE!

05:24.538 --> 05:26.005
HELP!

05:29.243 --> 05:31.310
YOGA?

05:31.345 --> 05:34.046
I HAD NO IDEA IT COULD
BE SO... DAMAGING.

05:34.082 --> 05:36.415
WELL, IT IS
IF IT'S A NEW INSTRUCTOR

05:36.483 --> 05:38.150
AND THEY'RE SHOWING YOU
A COOL NEW POSE.

05:38.186 --> 05:39.351
WHAT NEW POSE?

05:39.420 --> 05:41.587
IT'S CALLED
"THE BRIDGE TO PEACE."

05:41.622 --> 05:43.723
-WHAT HAPPENED?
-MY BRIDGE COLLAPSED.

05:44.926 --> 05:46.525
ARE YOU GOING BACK
TO HIS CLASS?

05:46.560 --> 05:47.760
NO!

05:47.829 --> 05:49.995
NO, HE BLAMED ME
FOR SPRAINING MY WRIST.

05:50.031 --> 05:52.231
HE SAID IT WAS 'CAUSE MY CHAKRAS
WERE MISALIGNED.

05:52.266 --> 05:53.265
OH, THE NERVE!

05:53.334 --> 05:54.299
WELL, THAT'S JUST BAD KARMA.

05:55.636 --> 05:57.002
SO I GUESS THIS MEANS

05:57.071 --> 05:59.004
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO POSTPONE
THE SPRING INVENTORY.

05:59.040 --> 06:00.405
OH, YOU MEAN
THE SPRING INVENTORY

06:00.474 --> 06:02.108
THAT'S REALLY
OUR WINTER INVENTORY?

06:02.143 --> 06:03.209
TO BE FAIR,

06:03.244 --> 06:04.276
IT'S ACTUALLY
OUR FALL INVENTORY.

06:04.345 --> 06:05.344
OKAY, THAT'S IT.

06:05.379 --> 06:06.345
WE NEED TO HIRE
SOME HELP.

06:06.380 --> 06:07.479
YOU MEAN
A NEW EMPLOYEE?

06:07.514 --> 06:08.748
JUST TEMPORARY.

06:08.783 --> 06:10.182
SOMEONE WHO CAN HELP US
WITH THE INVENTORY,

06:10.218 --> 06:11.350
OH, AND ALSO BRING
UP THOSE BOXES

06:11.385 --> 06:12.384
FROM THE BASEMENT.

06:12.453 --> 06:13.652
OOH, IT WOULD BE GOOD
TO GET SOMEONE

06:13.687 --> 06:14.887
TO CHECK THE CRAWL SPACE.

06:14.922 --> 06:16.722
WE BETTER HURRY UP
AND HIRE THAT PERSON.

06:16.758 --> 06:17.990
THEY ARE ALREADY WAY BEHIND.

06:18.025 --> 06:19.491
[DOOR OPENING]

06:20.561 --> 06:22.161
HELLO, UM...

06:22.196 --> 06:23.695
I'M GUESSING
YOU'RE THE ANTIQUE DEALERS?

06:23.731 --> 06:25.597
WHAT GAVE US AWAY?

06:25.633 --> 06:27.666
I'M LOOKING
FOR JENNIFER SHANNON.

06:27.701 --> 06:28.868
OH, I'M JENNIFER SHANNON,

06:28.903 --> 06:29.701
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER, DANI.

06:29.771 --> 06:30.936
HELLO.

06:30.972 --> 06:31.971
I'M IAN HATHAWAY.

06:32.039 --> 06:33.038
[DANI]:
MR. HATHAWAY,

06:33.074 --> 06:35.307
UM, HOW CAN WE HELP YOU?

06:35.342 --> 06:36.308
WELL,
A CLIENT OF MINE, LARRY BRADY,

06:36.343 --> 06:38.577
PASSED AWAY LAST WEEKEND.

06:38.612 --> 06:40.646
HE HAD A HEART ATTACK
ON HIS 60TH BIRTHDAY.

06:40.681 --> 06:42.681
OH, I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

06:42.750 --> 06:44.083
THANK YOU.

06:44.118 --> 06:45.918
HIS ESTATE HAS PASSED ON
TO HIS YOUNGER BROTHER, SCOTT,

06:45.987 --> 06:49.155
AND SCOTT'S LOOKING TO SELL
SOME OF LARRY'S BELONGINGS.

06:49.223 --> 06:50.890
AND I'M GUESSING
THERE ARE A FEW ANTIQUES?

06:50.925 --> 06:52.124
THAT'S RIGHT.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.994
YEAH,
LARRY WAS AN AVID COLLECTOR.

06:55.062 --> 06:56.228
IN FACT, HE HAS
AN IMPRESSIVE COLLECTION

06:56.264 --> 06:57.096
OF ANTIQUE CAMERAS.

06:57.165 --> 06:58.998
WOW.

06:59.033 --> 07:01.033
WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS,

07:01.068 --> 07:02.601
BUT WE'RE GLAD
YOU SOMEHOW FOUND US.

07:02.670 --> 07:04.003
ACTUALLY,

07:04.038 --> 07:05.905
IT WAS LARRY'S NEPHEW, TONY,
THAT RECOMMENDED YOU.

07:05.940 --> 07:08.240
HE WENT TO SCHOOL
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER, I BELIEVE.

07:08.276 --> 07:09.675
HANNAH.

07:09.710 --> 07:12.377
I HAD NO IDEA
SHE WAS SO GOOD AT P.R.

07:12.413 --> 07:13.712
I KNOW THAT LARRY
WOULD WANT HIS COLLECTION

07:13.747 --> 07:14.880
WELL TAKEN CARE OF,

07:14.916 --> 07:16.515
SO I ASKED AROUND,
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU,

07:16.583 --> 07:18.417
YOUR SHOP HAS
AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION.

07:19.821 --> 07:20.953
I'LL BE AT HIS HOUSE
LATER TODAY

07:20.988 --> 07:22.654
IF YOU'D LIKE
TO STOP BY.

07:22.690 --> 07:23.923
THERE'S THE ADDRESS,
AND I CAN SHOW YOU THE CAMERAS.

07:23.958 --> 07:24.924
OH, THANK YOU.

07:24.959 --> 07:25.991
WE'LL BE THERE.

07:26.027 --> 07:26.826
ALL RIGHT.

07:26.861 --> 07:27.960
WELL, THANK YOU, LADIES.

07:27.995 --> 07:28.894
THANK YOU.

07:30.298 --> 07:31.496
WHOA...

07:31.532 --> 07:33.332
IS THAT WHAT I THINK IT IS?

07:33.367 --> 07:34.967
WELL, IF YOU'RE THINKING
IT'S A BIG CONSIGNMENT,

07:35.002 --> 07:36.035
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

07:36.070 --> 07:38.137
YEAH... OW.

07:38.172 --> 07:40.139
WE ARE DEFINITELY
HIRING SOMEONE.

07:54.989 --> 07:56.355
AH.

07:56.390 --> 07:57.522
OOH.

07:57.591 --> 07:58.958
THIS IS NICE.

07:59.026 --> 08:00.592
IT'S A LITTLE SMALL.

08:00.661 --> 08:02.027
WELL, SOMETHING TELLS ME

08:02.063 --> 08:04.463
IF YOU LIVED HERE,
YOU'D FIND A WAY TO MANAGE.

08:04.531 --> 08:05.530
WELL, I'D HAVE TO SEE

08:05.566 --> 08:07.132
WHAT THE CLOSET SPACE
LOOKS LIKE FIRST.

08:07.168 --> 08:08.200
[LAUGHS]

08:14.608 --> 08:17.409
[IAN]: THANK YOU FOR
COMING OUT TO THE HOUSE.

08:17.444 --> 08:19.044
[JENN]: IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

08:19.113 --> 08:21.646
[IAN]: YES, MR. BRADY TOOK
GREAT PRIDE IN HIS HOME.

08:21.715 --> 08:24.016
HE BOUGHT THIS HOUSE,
PLANNING ON HAVING A BIG FAMILY,

08:24.051 --> 08:25.751
BUT...

08:25.786 --> 08:27.086
LIFE WORKED OUT DIFFERENTLY.

08:27.121 --> 08:28.220
WELL...

08:28.256 --> 08:29.154
THAT HAPPENS.

08:30.358 --> 08:32.892
NOW, WE PLAN TO SELL MOST ITEMS
AT AUCTION,

08:32.927 --> 08:33.859
BUT WE THOUGHT
THE CAMERA COLLECTION

08:33.895 --> 08:35.361
MIGHT DO BETTER
ON CONSIGNMENT.

08:35.395 --> 08:37.796
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,
WHY THE RUSH TO SELL EVERYTHING?

08:37.831 --> 08:40.732
AH, YES, WELL...

08:40.768 --> 08:42.967
MR. BRADY WAS A GENEROUS MAN...
TO A FAULT.

08:43.004 --> 08:44.403
UNFORTUNATELY,

08:44.438 --> 08:46.005
HE LEFT HIS ESTATE
WITH QUITE A FEW DEBTS

08:46.040 --> 08:47.506
AND VERY LITTLE CAPITAL.

08:47.541 --> 08:50.209
I CAN RELATE.

08:50.244 --> 08:51.343
WELL, HIS YOUNGER BROTHER,
SCOTT,

08:51.379 --> 08:52.378
THOUGHT IT BEST
TO LIQUIDATE HIS ASSETS

08:52.413 --> 08:53.312
AND SELL THE HOUSE.

08:55.283 --> 08:58.017
WELL, WE APPRECIATE
THE BUSINESS, BUT...

08:58.052 --> 08:59.985
YOU WOULD PROBABLY GET
MORE MONEY FOR THE CAMERAS

09:00.021 --> 09:01.753
AT AUCTION, TOO.

09:01.789 --> 09:03.822
WELL, THAT'S TRUE,
BUT, UH...

09:03.857 --> 09:05.791
IT ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE MONEY.

09:05.826 --> 09:07.326
I MEAN, LARRY WAS MY FRIEND
AS WELL AS MY CLIENT.

09:08.996 --> 09:09.895
HE PUT HIS COLLECTION TOGETHER
HIMSELF,

09:09.931 --> 09:11.663
AND I JUST KNOW

09:11.698 --> 09:13.532
HE WOULD HAVE LOVED TO STUMBLE
ACROSS ITEMS LIKE THIS

09:13.567 --> 09:14.533
IN A SHOP LIKE YOURS.

09:16.137 --> 09:17.303
RIGHT THIS WAY,
PLEASE.

09:29.450 --> 09:32.451
WOW, THIS IS
QUITE A COLLECTION.

09:32.486 --> 09:33.785
LARRY TOOK UP
PHOTOGRAPHY

09:33.821 --> 09:36.588
AFTER HE SOLD
HIS INVESTMENT COMPANY.

09:36.623 --> 09:38.257
APPARENTLY,
IT WAS A CHILDHOOD LOVE

09:38.326 --> 09:39.658
HE SET ASIDE FOR WORK.

09:39.693 --> 09:41.593
WELL, THERE ARE
A LOT OF ITEMS.

09:41.628 --> 09:42.694
WE'LL NEED
TO COME BACK

09:42.729 --> 09:43.762
AND PACK EVERYTHING
UP FOR TRANSPORT.

09:43.831 --> 09:45.130
OF COURSE, YEAH,

09:45.166 --> 09:46.198
AND I CAN MAKE SURE
YOU HAVE ACCESS TO THE HOUSE.

09:46.267 --> 09:47.232
[POUNDING ON DOOR]

09:48.635 --> 09:51.303
UH...
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME...

09:52.539 --> 09:54.039
WHOA...

09:54.075 --> 09:55.841
WOW.

09:55.876 --> 09:58.177
THERE IS
A LOT OF STUFF.

09:58.245 --> 09:59.478
WE'RE DEFINITELY
GOING TO NEED...

09:59.546 --> 10:00.545
DON'T SAY IT.

10:00.581 --> 10:03.148
A HAND
GETTING IT BACK TO THE SHOP.

10:03.184 --> 10:04.283
[LAUGHING]

10:05.786 --> 10:06.952
HEY, WHAT'S THIS?

10:10.958 --> 10:12.224
WHAT?

10:12.259 --> 10:13.525
OH...

10:13.560 --> 10:14.826
DANI, LOOK AT THIS.

10:14.862 --> 10:16.595
WOW.

10:16.630 --> 10:18.663
I THINK THERE MIGHT STILL BE
FILM IN THERE.

10:18.699 --> 10:19.965
OH...

10:20.001 --> 10:21.633
I WONDER
IF THIS IS ONE OF THE ITEMS

10:21.668 --> 10:22.934
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO SELL.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.803
-[SHUTTER CLICKING]
-OH!

10:24.838 --> 10:27.039
I THINK I JUST TOOK A PHOTO.

10:27.074 --> 10:28.907
YOU MEAN
YOU JUST TOOK A PHOTO OF ME.

10:30.677 --> 10:32.544
WELL, WE BETTER HOPE
IT'S PART OF THE SALE.

10:33.881 --> 10:35.447
I'LL ASK IAN.

10:35.516 --> 10:37.349
I HOPE YOU GOT
MY GOOD SIDE.

10:38.652 --> 10:39.918
[IAN]:
HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

10:39.953 --> 10:41.286
THIS IS HIGHLY INAPPROPRIATE.

10:41.355 --> 10:43.022
[WALTER]: YOUR SECRETARY
TOLD ME WHERE YOU WERE.

10:43.057 --> 10:45.424
IF YOU'D STOP DUCKING MY CALLS,
I WOULDN'T HAVE TO DO THIS.

10:45.459 --> 10:48.360
LOOK, LARRY PROMISED THAT MONEY
TO THE RESTAURANT.

10:48.396 --> 10:49.928
WE NEED IT
TO STAY OPEN.

10:49.963 --> 10:50.896
DO YOU HAVE A CONTRACT?

10:50.931 --> 10:52.697
LARRY SIGN A CONTRACT?

10:52.733 --> 10:53.765
YOU'RE JOKING, RIGHT?

10:53.800 --> 10:56.135
WALTER, THERE IS NO MONEY.

10:56.170 --> 10:57.702
LARRY WAS COMPLETELY TAPPED OUT.

10:57.738 --> 10:59.171
EVERYTHING LEFT
IS SCOTT'S NOW.

10:59.206 --> 11:01.840
[WALTER]:
YOU KNOW, LARRY'S GONE.

11:01.909 --> 11:03.875
I SHOULD FINALLY GET WHAT'S DUE.

[CLEARING THROAT]

11:08.882 --> 11:10.549
OH.

11:10.584 --> 11:13.018
MRS. SHANNON,
I'M SORRY IF YOU HEARD THAT.

11:13.087 --> 11:15.054
I DON'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT.

11:15.089 --> 11:16.355
IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU HAVE
YOUR HANDS FULL.

11:16.390 --> 11:17.356
OH...

11:17.391 --> 11:19.324
IT'S ALL PART OF THE JOB.

11:19.360 --> 11:20.426
IS THERE SOMETHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

11:20.461 --> 11:21.593
YES, THIS CAMERA.

11:21.628 --> 11:22.761
IS IT PART OF THE CONSIGNMENT?

11:24.331 --> 11:26.065
I DON'T REMEMBER IT
AS PART OF HIS COLLECTION,

11:26.100 --> 11:27.332
BUT HE HAD SO MANY.

11:27.368 --> 11:30.035
WELL, WE ACCIDENTALLY
TOOK A PICTURE.

11:30.104 --> 11:31.002
THERE'S FILM IN IT.

11:31.072 --> 11:33.072
OH, I SEE.

11:33.107 --> 11:35.974
BEST TO GET IT DEVELOPED
BEFORE WE PUT IT UP FOR SALE,

11:36.009 --> 11:38.143
IN CASE ANY OF THE PHOTOS
HAVE SENTIMENTAL VALUE.

11:38.212 --> 11:39.545
OF COURSE.
I CAN HANDLE THAT.

11:39.580 --> 11:41.346
AH, THANK YOU.

11:41.382 --> 11:42.281
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

11:42.316 --> 11:43.215
OF COURSE.

11:48.255 --> 11:49.488
YOUR MOTHER'S GOING
TO BE SO IMPRESSED

11:49.523 --> 11:51.056
THAT WE TACKLED
DINNER ON OUR OWN.

11:51.092 --> 11:52.857
IT'S HARD TO MESS UP PASTA.

11:52.893 --> 11:54.159
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.

11:54.228 --> 11:56.228
ONE TIME IN COLLEGE,
I STARTED A FIRE,

TRYING TO MAKE

12:10.177 --> 12:11.577

WANTS TO PUBLISH

THIS PAPER THAT I DID
ON TENNESSEE WILLIAMS

12:15.983 --> 12:17.416

12:19.353 --> 12:20.986
THAT'S NOT GREAT?

I'M GOING TO DO IT.

ON A COLLEGE APPLICATION.

12:29.263 --> 12:30.829
YOU SHOULD PUBLISH IT.

12:30.864 --> 12:31.763
WE'LL SEE.

12:33.000 --> 12:34.032
HEY, EVERYONE,
SORRY I'M LATE,

HIS BAND PLAY ALL THE TIME.

PRETTY GOOD.

12:49.517 --> 12:51.016
BUT WE MIGHT BE SELLING
SOME OF HIS ANTIQUE CAMERAS.

MEANS HAPPY WIFE.

TOOK A PHOTO OF ME,

AND NOW I HAVE
TO GET THE FILM DEVELOPED.

TO BE DIFFICULT,

CONSIDERING EVERYTHING'S
DIGITAL THESE DAYS.

13:11.038 --> 13:12.070
I KNOW,

BUT THE CLIENT
DOESN'T WANT US

13:13.307 --> 13:14.939
TO SELL THE CAMERA
WITH A PICTURE OF ME IN IT.

13:14.975 --> 13:17.376
WELL, I'D SAY ANY CAMERA
WITH A PICTURE OF YOU IN IT

13:17.411 --> 13:18.410
IS WORTH DOUBLE.

13:18.479 --> 13:19.444

13:19.480 --> 13:21.647

13:21.715 --> 13:22.947
AND THIS LOOKS SO GOOD.

13:23.016 --> 13:24.283

13:24.318 --> 13:25.484
AS YOUR FLAMING

PICKING UP AT THE SHOP.

BUT WITH DANI'S
SPRAINED WRIST,

DOES THAT MEAN

THE EXPERIENCE.

13:57.984 --> 13:59.117

13:59.152 --> 14:00.151
WELL, ACTUALLY,
YOU'D BE DOING ME A FAVOR.

14:00.187 --> 14:01.587
I WANT TO FIND SOMEPLACE

14:01.622 --> 14:03.488
TO DEVELOP THE FILM
FROM THAT CAMERA TOMORROW.

14:03.524 --> 14:06.291
I DON'T USUALLY GET INVOLVED
IN SHOP BUSINESS.

14:06.327 --> 14:07.726
YOU SURE I WOULDN'T BE STEPPING
ON HER TOES?

14:07.761 --> 14:10.395
OH, NO, DANI WOULD LOVE IT
IF YOU HELPED HER,

14:10.464 --> 14:11.930
AND YOU KNOW WHAT TO LOOK FOR
IN A GOOD EMPLOYEE.

14:11.965 --> 14:13.732
YEAH, I GUESS I DO.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.434
AND BESIDES,
DANI HATES TO TELL PEOPLE NO.

14:15.502 --> 14:16.702
SHE'D WANT SOMEONE ELSE
TO DO THAT.

THIS THING IS IN GREAT SHAPE.

14:33.554 --> 14:34.319

14:34.355 --> 14:36.788
BUT NOT THIS NICE.

14:36.823 --> 14:38.990
WELL, THE OWNER WAS
A REAL CAMERA ENTHUSIAST.

14:39.025 --> 14:39.858
OH, WHAT'S

COME IN, HOPEFULLY.

15:08.789 --> 15:10.289

THIS MODEL IN DECADES.

15:10.324 --> 15:11.222

CAN BE VERY STRESSFUL.

16:37.878 --> 16:40.245
UNCLE LARRY AND I
WERE VERY CLOSE.

OF MY LIFE,

HE WAS BUSY
WITH HIS COMPANY,

16:44.117 --> 16:46.017
BUT THE LAST
FEW YEARS,

16:46.052 --> 16:47.952
WE REALLY GOT A CHANCE
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

BENEATH THE STRICT

WITH ONE OF HIS CAMERAS.

OF YOUR SHOP.

TALKS ABOUT YOU,

17:05.906 --> 17:07.372
I KNEW THAT YOU'D
FIND OWNERS

17:07.407 --> 17:09.207
THAT APPRECIATE IT
AS MUCH AS HE DID.

17:09.242 --> 17:10.509

17:10.544 --> 17:11.877

OF YOU TO SAY.

THAN YOU THINK.

TO MY CUSTOMERS,

17:23.089 --> 17:24.522
THAT THEY WILL ALWAYS HAVE
THE MEMORIES,

EVEN THOUGH THE OBJECT
HAS MOVED ON

17:26.226 --> 17:27.992

FOR NEW PEOPLE.

OF LOOKING AT IT.

17:45.446 --> 17:46.778
NOTHING FOR YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT.

17:46.814 --> 17:48.713
OH, WELL...

17:48.749 --> 17:50.649
I AM A VERY GOOD WORRIER.

17:50.684 --> 17:51.616
YOU JUST ASK HANNAH.

17:54.354 --> 17:55.487
DO YOU EVER GET SOMETHING

17:55.522 --> 17:56.922
BOUNCING AROUND
INSIDE YOUR HEAD,

17:56.957 --> 18:00.391
AND YOU JUST CAN'T LET IT GO
UNTIL YOU SAY IT OUT LOUD?

18:00.427 --> 18:02.160
YOU'VE JUST DESCRIBED
EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE.

18:03.630 --> 18:05.063
IT'S JUST...

18:05.098 --> 18:06.898
THERE HAS BEEN SOMETHING
THAT'S BEEN BOTHERING ME

18:06.967 --> 18:07.699
ABOUT LARRY'S DEATH.

18:09.069 --> 18:10.602
HE WAS AS HEALTHY
AS A HORSE.

18:10.637 --> 18:12.036
HE WOULDN'T DROP DEAD
OUT OF THE BLUE.

18:13.373 --> 18:14.840
SOMETIMES, THESE THINGS
ARE HARD TO PREDICT.

18:16.109 --> 18:18.076
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

18:18.144 --> 18:20.612
A WEEK BEFORE HE DIED,
LARRY CHANGED,

18:20.647 --> 18:22.113
AND HE WAS PUTTING
ON A GOOD SHOW,

18:22.182 --> 18:23.214
BUT I COULD SEE THROUGH IT.

18:23.249 --> 18:25.316
HE WAS WORRIED...
AND SCARED.

18:25.352 --> 18:26.818
SCARED OF WHAT?

18:28.856 --> 18:30.655
HE CALLED ME ONE NIGHT,

18:30.691 --> 18:33.291
AND HE SAID...

18:33.360 --> 18:35.360
HE SAID THAT SOMEBODY
WAS TRYING TO DESTROY HIM.

18:36.930 --> 18:38.563
TONY, IF YOU HAVE
ANY SUSPICIONS,

18:38.599 --> 18:39.731
YOU SHOULD GO
TO THE POLICE.

18:39.766 --> 18:41.299
I TOLD MY DAD.

18:41.334 --> 18:43.902
I TOLD IAN, LARRY'S LAWYER.

18:43.937 --> 18:46.037
THEY SAID
I WAS IMAGINING THINGS.

18:52.513 --> 18:53.512
YOU THINK I'M CRAZY, TOO.

18:53.547 --> 18:55.413
NO, NO,
I DON'T THINK YOU'RE CRAZY.

18:55.448 --> 18:57.415
BELIEVE ME, I HAVE MY SUSPICIONS
ALL THE TIME.

18:57.450 --> 18:59.918
I JUST WISH
I COULD HELP,

18:59.953 --> 19:00.986
BUT I'M NOT A DETECTIVE.

19:03.857 --> 19:05.957
WELL...
DON'T LET ME KEEP YOU.

19:05.993 --> 19:07.759
THANKS... FOR LISTENING.

19:07.794 --> 19:10.829
FEELS LIKE NO ONE ELSE DOES.

19:10.864 --> 19:12.463
OF COURSE.

19:22.809 --> 19:25.143
MANNY,
YOU WORK FAST.

19:25.211 --> 19:26.444
YEAH, YOU GOT LUCKY.

19:26.513 --> 19:29.147
THE FILM IN THE CAMERA'S
GOT TO BE OVER 50 YEARS OLD,

19:29.182 --> 19:30.815
AND YET SOMEHOW
IT DIDN'T CRUMBLE AWAY,

19:30.884 --> 19:32.383
AND, WELL, I WAS ABLE
TO GET IT DEVELOPED.

19:32.419 --> 19:33.685
OH... WOW.

19:33.720 --> 19:36.254
WELL, I'M NOTHING IF NOT LUCKY.

19:36.289 --> 19:38.322
SO THERE WERE JUST
THREE PHOTOS ON THE ROLL,

19:38.358 --> 19:39.223
AND YOU'RE ONE OF THEM.

19:40.293 --> 19:42.160
OOH.

19:42.228 --> 19:43.294
BLACK AND WHITE, HUH?

19:43.329 --> 19:44.495
PHOTOGRAPHERS LOVE IT.

19:44.531 --> 19:45.664
IT REALLY CAPTURES EMOTION WELL.

19:45.699 --> 19:47.799
WELL, IT DIDN'T CAPTURE
MY GOOD SIDE.

19:49.202 --> 19:50.168
WHAT ARE ON
THE OTHER TWO PICTURES?

19:50.203 --> 19:52.904
THIS IS WHERE
IT GETS INTERESTING.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.138
ONE'S A SHOT OF A WOMAN
HOLDING A CAMERA.

19:56.176 --> 19:57.208
HUH.

19:57.277 --> 19:58.910
THAT LOOKS LIKE IT WAS TAKEN

19:58.946 --> 20:00.445
ON THE DAY
OF LARRY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY.

20:01.982 --> 20:03.481
AND NOW THIS LAST SHOT,
UM...

20:03.516 --> 20:06.284
THIS LAST SHOT'S
A LITTLE... DISTURBING.

20:06.352 --> 20:08.019
JUST WARNING YOU.

20:08.055 --> 20:09.153
OH, DEAR.

20:09.189 --> 20:10.088
HOW DISTURBING?

20:15.762 --> 20:17.729
I THINK THAT'S LARRY BRADY.

20:17.764 --> 20:18.863
THE GUY WHO DIED?

20:20.634 --> 20:22.067
THEY SAID
IT WAS A HEART ATTACK,

20:22.102 --> 20:23.367
BUT THIS LOOKS
LIKE A STRUGGLE.

20:24.738 --> 20:26.037
I'LL TAKE THIS TO THE POLICE.

20:26.106 --> 20:27.005
THEY'LL HANDLE IT.

20:37.134 --> 20:38.067
HEY, DANI.

20:38.102 --> 20:38.968
JASON!

20:39.036 --> 20:40.436
-HI!
-HI.

20:40.505 --> 20:42.137
JENN ASKED ME
TO STOP BY.

20:42.173 --> 20:43.405
YEAH, SHE SAID

20:43.441 --> 20:44.941
YOU WERE GOING TO BE
MY INTERVIEW BUDDY TODAY.

20:44.976 --> 20:46.542
SO YOU'RE OKAY?

20:46.578 --> 20:48.845
I DIDN'T WANT YOU TO FEEL
LIKE I WAS INVADING YOUR TURF.

20:48.913 --> 20:50.312
OH, NO,
THE MORE, THE MERRIER!

20:50.381 --> 20:51.547
I'M GRATEFUL
FOR YOUR EXPERTISE.

20:51.583 --> 20:52.648
OKAY.

20:52.684 --> 20:53.449
WELL, HERE'S MY
INTERVIEW CHECKLIST.

20:54.519 --> 20:55.585
CHECKLIST?

20:55.620 --> 20:56.953
YOU NEVER WANT
TO HIRE THE WRONG PERSON.

20:57.021 --> 20:59.321
I FIND THESE 20 QUESTIONS
ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T.

20:59.357 --> 21:01.223
OF COURSE.

21:01.258 --> 21:02.625
GREAT,
SO WHERE SHOULD WE SET UP?

21:02.694 --> 21:03.493
I THOUGHT WE COULD USE
THIS TABLE.

21:04.629 --> 21:05.795
PERFECT.
YOU RELAX.

21:05.830 --> 21:07.062
OKAY.

21:18.643 --> 21:20.009
DON'T TELL JENN.

21:21.078 --> 21:22.678
OKAY.

21:25.717 --> 21:26.616
HEY, FRANK.

21:28.319 --> 21:29.652
HEY, JENN.

21:29.687 --> 21:30.653
WHAT BRINGS YOU DOWN HERE?

21:30.722 --> 21:32.688
WELL, I HAVE
A QUESTION FOR YOU.

21:32.724 --> 21:33.723
DO I HAVE TO ANSWER?

21:35.493 --> 21:37.560
DO YOU RECOGNIZE
THE NAME LARRY BRADY?

21:37.595 --> 21:38.828
YEAH.

21:38.863 --> 21:40.596
GOT A CALL OUT TO HIS
MANSION THREE DAYS AGO.

21:40.632 --> 21:42.297
AND HE WAS DEAD.
APPEARED TO BE A HEART ATTACK?

21:43.401 --> 21:44.433
WHERE ARE YOU GOING WITH THIS?

21:44.502 --> 21:46.602
I PICKED UP A CAMERA
AT LARRY'S ESTATE.

21:46.638 --> 21:48.638
WE'RE HANDLING THE SALE
OF SOME OF HIS THINGS,

21:48.706 --> 21:50.673
AND WHEN I GOT THE FILM
DEVELOPED,

21:50.708 --> 21:52.474
THIS IS WHAT I FOUND.

21:55.813 --> 21:57.479
WAS THIS PICTURE TAKEN
BY A DOG?

21:57.515 --> 21:59.782
IT'S AN ODD ANGLE,
BUT THAT IS LARRY BRADY,

21:59.817 --> 22:02.518
AND THAT IS SOMEONE ELSE
WITH THEIR HANDS AT HIS NECK.

22:02.554 --> 22:04.319
IF IT WAS
A STRANGULATION,

22:04.355 --> 22:05.922
THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN
RESIDUAL BRUISING,

22:05.957 --> 22:06.923
AND THERE WASN'T ANY.

22:06.991 --> 22:09.425
THE HANDS AREN'T
AROUND HIS NECK.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.626
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING.

22:10.662 --> 22:11.627
CAN I BORROW THIS?

22:12.697 --> 22:13.563
YEAH.

22:16.400 --> 22:17.533
IF YOU LOOK
RIGHT HERE,

22:17.569 --> 22:19.035
THERE'S A DESIGN
ON THE GLOVE...

22:22.607 --> 22:24.040
AND IF YOU LOOK CLOSELY
OVER HERE...

22:26.477 --> 22:27.610
RIGHT BETWEEN HIS FINGERS...

22:27.645 --> 22:29.946
THERE APPEARS TO BE A SYRINGE.

22:33.651 --> 22:35.184
HUH.

22:35.219 --> 22:37.152
YOU DON'T MISS A THING.

22:39.023 --> 22:41.824
WELL, THERE WAS NO
SYRINGE ON THE SCENE.

22:41.859 --> 22:42.892
I HAD COFFEE
WITH LARRY'S NEPHEW, TONY.

22:44.495 --> 22:46.395
HE SUSPECTS FOUL PLAY
IN LARRY'S DEATH.

22:46.430 --> 22:47.863
AND HE CAME TO YOU?

22:47.899 --> 22:49.331
OH, WELL,

22:49.366 --> 22:51.166
HE'S A FRIEND OF HANNAH'S
FROM SCHOOL,

22:51.235 --> 22:52.935
AND I TOLD HIM
TO COME TO THE POLICE,

22:53.004 --> 22:54.971
AND THEN WHEN I FOUND
THAT PHOTO,

22:55.006 --> 22:56.105
I BROUGHT IT STRAIGHT HERE
TO YOU.

22:57.475 --> 22:58.708
WELL, THIS PHOTO IS DISTURBING,

22:58.743 --> 22:59.976
BUT WE WON'T HAVE
ANY MORE INFORMATION

23:00.011 --> 23:01.443
UNTIL WE HEAR BACK
FROM THE AUTOPSY REPORT.

23:04.181 --> 23:05.414
IS LARRY'S BODY
STILL IN THE MORGUE?

23:06.784 --> 23:07.817
THAT'S A POLICE MATTER.

23:07.852 --> 23:09.585
YEP.

23:09.621 --> 23:10.552
WELL, I'LL LEAVE THAT WITH YOU.

23:10.588 --> 23:11.954
THANKS.

23:11.990 --> 23:13.956
AND, UH, CALL YOU LATER.

23:13.992 --> 23:14.890
I HOPE NOT.

23:20.865 --> 23:22.064
I GRADUATE IN JUNE,

23:22.100 --> 23:23.298
SO I'M LOOKING
TO MAKE A LITTLE MONEY

23:23.334 --> 23:24.934
BEFORE COLLEGE IN THE FALL.

23:24.969 --> 23:27.503
HAVE YOU EVER WORKED
WITH ANTIQUES BEFORE?

23:27.538 --> 23:28.904
I HAD A JOB
WITH A MOVING COMPANY

23:28.973 --> 23:30.305
LAST SUMMER.

23:30.341 --> 23:32.675
SOME OF THOSE BOXES
PROBABLY HAD ANTIQUES IN THEM.

23:32.710 --> 23:33.442
SO WHAT'S YOUR SCHEDULE LIKE
NOW?

23:33.511 --> 23:34.810

ALL WE NEED.

ANY QUESTIONS?

23:46.490 --> 23:48.991
WHERE DO YOU GUYS GET
ALL THIS... OLD STUFF?

23:50.828 --> 23:54.496
UM... AUCTIONS
AND GARAGE SALES.

JUST BRING IT IN.

WHAT'S AN ANTIQUE

24:02.239 --> 24:03.939
WELL, WE DO.

WE'RE ANTIQUE DEALERS.

24:05.076 --> 24:05.975
OH.

24:06.010 --> 24:07.276
THAT MAKES SENSE.

24:07.344 --> 24:09.845
WELL, THANK YOU
FOR YOUR TIME, TRAVIS.

24:09.881 --> 24:12.281
-WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.
-NO, THANK YOU.

24:16.520 --> 24:17.586
HE SEEMS LIKE A GOOD KID.

24:17.621 --> 24:20.022
HE DOESN'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT ANTIQUES.

24:20.058 --> 24:22.424
YOU'RE NOT HIRING SOMEONE
FOR THE FRONT OF THE SHOP.

24:22.459 --> 24:24.359
JUST SOMEONE
TO SORT AND MOVE BOXES.

24:24.395 --> 24:26.095
BUT SHOULDN'T YOU AT LEAST KNOW
SOMETHING

24:26.164 --> 24:27.863
ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE SORTING
AND MOVING?

24:27.932 --> 24:30.265
YOU CAN TEACH PEOPLE
ABOUT ANTIQUES,

24:30.301 --> 24:31.500
BUT YOU CAN'T TEACH THEM

HAVE EXPERIENCE.

REFERENCES.

SO YOU KNOW HE'S
A TEAM PLAYER.

24:43.715 --> 24:46.982

CONSIDER CONSIDERING HIM.

24:56.594 --> 24:58.327

24:58.395 --> 24:59.361
WELL, I DID,

24:59.396 --> 25:00.062

IT WAS GREAT.

25:01.632 --> 25:02.765
THANKS, HANNAH.

SO WHY WON'T YOU LET
YOUR TEACHER PUBLISH IT?

25:06.303 --> 25:07.402
I'D RATHER NOT TALK ABOUT IT.

25:07.438 --> 25:08.637

YOU DON'T WANT TO TELL ME?

SAME DISH THREE TIMES.

25:26.958 --> 25:28.423
ABOUT THAT MAN
THAT OWNED THAT CAMERA.

25:28.459 --> 25:31.293

MAY BE A MURDER.

25:33.131 --> 25:34.063

THE INTERVIEW GO TODAY?

FOR EXTRA COLLEGE MONEY.

26:42.800 --> 26:44.733
WELL, AT LEAST
IT WASN'T A PUN.

26:44.802 --> 26:46.635
NO, NOT AS MUCH "FUN".

26:47.805 --> 26:50.005
SO... LARRY...

26:50.041 --> 26:51.673
PROBABLY DIDN'T DIE
FROM NATURAL CAUSES.

26:51.709 --> 26:53.342
YOU KNOW
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO SAY.

26:53.377 --> 26:55.377
BUT YOU'RE GOING TO...
"ANYWAY"?

26:55.412 --> 26:58.113
VERY NICE.

26:58.149 --> 26:59.648
WELL, YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME

26:59.717 --> 27:01.350
ABOUT THE INJECTION MARK.

27:01.385 --> 27:02.985
NEAR HIS NECK.

27:03.020 --> 27:04.419
NOPE, DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU THAT.

27:04.455 --> 27:05.721
AND YOU DON'T HAVE
TO TELL ME

27:05.756 --> 27:07.356
ABOUT THE TRACE
ELEMENTS OF POISON

27:07.391 --> 27:08.657
YOU FOUND
IN HIS BLOODSTREAM.

27:08.692 --> 27:10.292
IF I TOLD YOU THAT,
I'D BE WRONG.

27:11.896 --> 27:13.495
REALLY?

27:13.530 --> 27:14.529
NO POISON?

27:14.565 --> 27:15.497
NOT POISON EXACTLY.

27:15.532 --> 27:17.066
POTASSIUM CHLORIDE.

27:17.101 --> 27:18.500
POTASSIUM CHLORIDE?

27:18.535 --> 27:20.870
NOTHING INHERENTLY UNUSUAL
ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE ITSELF.

27:20.938 --> 27:23.372
PEOPLE TAKE POTASSIUM CHLORIDE
SUPPLEMENTS ALL THE TIME.

27:23.407 --> 27:24.706
WHAT FOR?

27:24.742 --> 27:26.308
THEY HELP YOU MAINTAIN
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF POTASSIUM

27:26.344 --> 27:27.409
IN YOUR BLOOD.

27:27.444 --> 27:28.543
KEEPS YOUR KIDNEYS,
HEART, MUSCLES,

27:28.579 --> 27:31.646
BASICALLY EVERYTHING
WORKING RIGHT.

27:31.682 --> 27:34.283
NOW, IF YOU HAVE
A WELL-BALANCED DIET,

27:34.318 --> 27:35.851
DON'T NEED TO WORRY.

27:35.887 --> 27:37.452
IS THAT THE ONLY PLACE
YOU FIND IT, IN SUPPLEMENTS?

27:37.488 --> 27:40.122
NO, POTASSIUM CHLORIDE
HAS A LOT OF USES.

27:40.157 --> 27:41.223
IT FERTILIZES, DE-ICES...

27:41.259 --> 27:44.193
IT CAN EVEN BE
A SALT SUBSTITUTE.

27:44.262 --> 27:45.594
IT'S JUST
THE CONCENTRATED FORMS

27:45.629 --> 27:47.062
THAT YOU HAVE BE CAREFUL WITH.

27:47.098 --> 27:48.463
SO IT CAN BE INJECTED?

27:48.499 --> 27:49.631
THAT'S RIGHT,
SOME STATES USE IT

27:49.666 --> 27:52.034
WHEN ADMINISTERING
LETHAL INJECTIONS.

27:52.069 --> 27:53.168
IT CAN INDUCE A HEART ATTACK.

27:54.638 --> 27:57.706
SO I'M GUESSING LARRY BRADY'S
POTASSIUM CHLORIDE INTAKE

27:57.741 --> 27:59.174
WAS ABOVE SUPPLEMENT LEVEL.

27:59.210 --> 28:00.542
TO GET THOSE LEVELS,

28:00.611 --> 28:02.477
HE WOULD HAVE TO SWALLOW
AN ENTIRE BOTTLE OF SUPPLEMENTS,

28:02.546 --> 28:04.079
MAYBE MORE.

28:04.115 --> 28:05.047
THANK YOU, DR. TRAMELL.

28:05.082 --> 28:06.115
YOU'VE BEEN A BIG HELP.

28:06.150 --> 28:07.482
WAIT. AREN'T YOU
FORGETTING SOMETHING?

28:07.518 --> 28:09.584
DON'T YOU WANT
TO HEAR MY POEM?

28:09.620 --> 28:11.153
NEXT TIME.
I'M LATE.

28:11.188 --> 28:12.521
PERFECT.
IT'S A "DATE".

28:12.556 --> 28:13.522
HA-HAH!

28:13.590 --> 28:15.224
"CAN'T WAIT!"

28:15.259 --> 28:16.158
[CHUCKLING]

28:22.411 --> 28:23.643
I APPRECIATE YOU
TAKING THE TIME TO SEE ME TODAY.

28:23.678 --> 28:24.511
JUST HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS
FOR YOU.

28:24.579 --> 28:25.812
YES, OF COURSE.

28:25.847 --> 28:27.180
ANYTHING I CAN DO TO HELP.

28:27.216 --> 28:28.615
SO YOU WERE THE ONE

28:28.650 --> 28:29.616
WHO DISCOVERED MR. BRADY'S BODY
IN THE STUDY, CORRECT?

28:29.651 --> 28:31.784
YES, WE WERE
GATHERING EVERYONE UP

28:31.853 --> 28:32.919
FOR A BIG GROUP PHOTO,

28:32.988 --> 28:34.787
BUT HE WAS MISSING
HIS BOW TIE,

28:34.823 --> 28:36.589
SO HE WENT BACK
INSIDE TO FIND IT.

28:36.625 --> 28:38.591
AND HOW LONG WOULD YOU SAY
MR. BRADY WAS IN THE HOUSE?

28:38.660 --> 28:41.428
A COUPLE OF MINUTES AT MOST.

28:41.463 --> 28:42.329
PEOPLE WERE
GETTING ANTSY,

28:42.398 --> 28:44.064
SO I WENT INSIDE
LOOKING FOR HIM.

28:44.099 --> 28:45.532
AND DID YOU NOTICE
ANYTHING ELSE IN THE ROOM?

28:45.567 --> 28:47.501
JUST LARRY...

28:47.569 --> 28:50.203
UM...
MR. BRADY ON THE FLOOR.

28:50.239 --> 28:52.672
BUT DID YOU SEE
ANYTHING AROUND HIM,

28:52.741 --> 28:54.041
OR ANYTHING OUT OF PLACE?

28:54.076 --> 28:57.344
THERE WERE SOME THINGS
SCATTERED ON HIS DESK.

28:57.379 --> 29:00.047
HE MIGHT HAVE KNOCKED THEM
AROUND WHEN HE FELL, BUT...

29:00.082 --> 29:02.382
I WASN'T REALLY LOOKING
AT THE ROOM.

29:02.418 --> 29:04.684
I WAS LOOKING AT HIS BODY.

29:04.753 --> 29:06.520
WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

29:06.555 --> 29:09.156
I SHOUTED FOR SOMEONE
TO CALL AN AMBULANCE,

29:09.191 --> 29:10.823
AND PEOPLE CAME RUNNING IN
FROM OUTSIDE.

29:10.892 --> 29:12.092
DO YOU KNOW WHO SHOWED UP FIRST?

29:12.127 --> 29:13.393
IT'S ALL SUCH A BLUR.

29:13.429 --> 29:14.627
I CAN'T REMEMBER.

29:14.663 --> 29:15.828
DO YOU HAPPEN
TO HAVE ANY COPIES

29:15.864 --> 29:17.697
OF THE PHOTOS
FROM THE PARTY THAT DAY?

29:17.732 --> 29:19.232
I HAVE THEM ALL ON MY COMPUTER,

29:19.268 --> 29:21.134
BUT I, UH,
I MADE SOME PRINTS

29:21.170 --> 29:22.235
IN CASE THE FAMILY
EVER WANTED THEM.

29:25.340 --> 29:26.806
I COULDN'T FIND PARKING

29:26.841 --> 29:28.875
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S
BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY.

29:28.910 --> 29:29.909
WHO ARE YOU?

29:29.945 --> 29:32.612
THE GUY BLOCKING THE DRIVEWAY.

29:32.647 --> 29:33.846
PETER, THIS IS
DETECTIVE LYNWOOD.

29:33.882 --> 29:34.914
HE'S ASKING QUESTIONS

29:34.950 --> 29:37.217
ABOUT LARRY
BRADY'S DEATH.

29:37.286 --> 29:39.152
IT WAS A HEART ATTACK...
RIGHT?

29:39.188 --> 29:41.621
I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP.

29:41.656 --> 29:42.489
DID YOU KNOW MR. BRADY?

29:42.524 --> 29:43.890
NOT WELL.

29:43.925 --> 29:45.592
HE HIRED BOTH OF US
FOR HIS PARTY.

29:45.627 --> 29:47.394
SANDY TOOK PHOTOS,
I HANDLED CATERING,

29:47.429 --> 29:49.028
BUT I COULDN'T STAY.

29:49.064 --> 29:50.763
I HAD A CORPORATE EVENT
TO OVERSEE ACROSS TOWN.

29:50.799 --> 29:52.132
IS THIS YOUR HUSBAND?

29:52.201 --> 29:53.066
BOYFRIEND.

29:55.070 --> 29:56.736
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE?
WE'RE LATE FOR AN EVENT.

29:58.273 --> 29:59.473
NO.

29:59.508 --> 30:00.940
THANK YOU.

30:00.976 --> 30:01.808
I'LL LET YOU KNOW
IF I HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

30:07.649 --> 30:09.782
[JENN]: THANK YOU
FOR MEETING ME, TONY.

30:09.851 --> 30:11.218
[TONY]: OF COURSE.

30:11.253 --> 30:12.552
YOU SAID YOU HAD
NEW INFORMATION

30:12.621 --> 30:13.820
ABOUT MY UNCLE?

30:13.855 --> 30:15.555
I DEVELOPED A PHOTO
FROM YOUR UNCLE'S CAMERA.

30:17.092 --> 30:18.525
THERE MIGHT BE SOMETHING
TO YOUR SUSPICIONS.

30:20.329 --> 30:21.294
CAN I SEE THE PHOTO?

30:21.363 --> 30:23.130
I GAVE IT
TO THE POLICE.

30:26.901 --> 30:28.235
THAT'S AWFUL.

30:28.270 --> 30:29.236
YOU SAID YOU THOUGHT

30:29.304 --> 30:30.036
SOMEONE WAS OUT
TO GET LARRY?

30:30.105 --> 30:31.804
THAT'S WHAT HE SAID,

30:31.840 --> 30:33.406
AND NOW LOOK,
HE'S GONE...

30:33.442 --> 30:35.208
AND BANKRUPT,
APPARENTLY.

30:35.277 --> 30:37.010
DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT HIS FINANCES?

30:38.413 --> 30:40.413
I WAS SHOCKED
WHEN I HEARD.

30:40.482 --> 30:42.349
HE ALWAYS SEEMED
LIKE HE HAD MONEY.

30:42.417 --> 30:44.884
HE WAS ALWAYS
LENDING IT TO PEOPLE.

30:44.919 --> 30:47.120
MAYBE HE WAS JUST TRYING
TO KEEP UP APPEARANCES.

30:47.156 --> 30:48.888
YOU KNOW, IF YOU HAD SAID THAT
TWO WEEKS AGO,

30:48.923 --> 30:50.723
I NEVER WOULD HAVE BELIEVED YOU,

30:50.759 --> 30:53.360
BUT LARRY LOVED
HIS LITTLE SECRETS.

30:53.428 --> 30:55.562
DID LARRY HAVE ANY ENEMIES,

30:55.597 --> 30:57.430
ANYONE YOU CAN THINK OF
THAT WOULD WANT TO HURT HIM?

30:59.734 --> 31:00.800
HE HAD THE ONE MAJOR ENEMY.

31:00.835 --> 31:01.801
HE DID?

31:01.870 --> 31:03.303
I SHOULDN'T SAY THIS,

31:03.338 --> 31:04.971
BUT HE'S BEEN ACTING SO STRANGE.

31:05.006 --> 31:06.173
WHO?

31:06.241 --> 31:08.275
IT'S MY DAD.

31:10.979 --> 31:13.380
YOU DON'T THINK YOUR FATHER
WOULD KILL HIS OWN BROTHER,

31:13.415 --> 31:14.314
DO YOU?

31:14.349 --> 31:15.882
NO.

31:15.950 --> 31:17.817
MAYBE? I DON'T KNOW.

31:17.886 --> 31:19.352
IT'S CRAZY TO CONSIDER.

31:19.388 --> 31:21.721
WELL, DID SOMETHING HAPPEN
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU THINK THIS?

31:21.790 --> 31:24.424
MY DAD HAS ALWAYS
RESENTED UNCLE LARRY.

31:24.459 --> 31:25.525
HE WAS THE ONE
WITH THE COMPANY,

31:25.561 --> 31:26.660
THE BIG HOUSE.

31:26.695 --> 31:28.961
MY DAD WAS NEVER GOOD
AT BUSINESS.

31:28.997 --> 31:31.531
STILL, THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
TO SUSPECT HIM OF MURDER.

31:31.567 --> 31:34.100
BUT I THINK
THAT HE ALSO STOLE FROM LARRY.

31:34.135 --> 31:36.936
IT WOULD BE
FOR AN INVESTMENT

31:37.005 --> 31:38.371
OR A COMPANY
THAT HE WANTED TO START,

31:38.407 --> 31:40.507
AND I THINK MY DAD WOULD JUST
KEEP MOST OF THE MONEY,

31:40.576 --> 31:41.741
AND LARRY,
HE'D FALL FOR IT EVERY TIME.

31:44.179 --> 31:45.778
I THINK
HE FELT SORRY FOR MY DAD.

31:45.814 --> 31:47.714
HAVE YOU EVER HEARD YOUR DAD
THREATEN LARRY?

31:49.084 --> 31:51.984
NOT EXACTLY...

31:52.020 --> 31:54.421
BUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO,

31:54.489 --> 31:55.422
LARRY CUT HIM OFF.

31:55.457 --> 31:57.123
NO MORE MONEY.

31:57.158 --> 32:00.260
MY DAD,
HE STOPPED TALKING TO HIM.

32:00.329 --> 32:02.329
HE SAID
HE'D GET IT ALL EVENTUALLY...

32:02.364 --> 32:03.230
WHEN LARRY WAS DEAD.

32:07.502 --> 32:09.669
YOU HAVE A LOVELY SHOP.

32:09.738 --> 32:11.771
I'VE SEEN QUITE A FEW
IN MY TIME,

32:11.840 --> 32:13.139
AND YOU CAN REALLY TELL

32:13.174 --> 32:15.342
WHEN A SHOP IS RUN
BY PEOPLE WHO CARE

32:15.410 --> 32:17.410
ABOUT THE ITEMS
THEY SELL.

32:17.446 --> 32:18.511
WELL...

32:18.547 --> 32:20.347
WHEN DID YOU GET
INTO ANTIQUES?

32:20.415 --> 32:22.048
WHEN I WAS A CHILD...

32:22.083 --> 32:23.717
BUT THEY WEREN'T "ANTIQUES".

32:23.752 --> 32:27.053
THEY WERE JUST ITEMS
IN MY HOUSE.

32:27.088 --> 32:29.088
I HAD A SMALL SHOP FOR YEARS,

32:29.157 --> 32:31.658
FIXING AND RESTORING OLD ITEMS.

32:31.693 --> 32:33.393
FURNITURE,
MOSTLY,

32:33.428 --> 32:35.061
BUT I'D LOVE IT

32:35.096 --> 32:38.465
WHEN SOMEONE BROUGHT IN
AN OLD MUSIC BOX,

32:38.500 --> 32:40.166
OR A CUCKOO CLOCK.

32:42.036 --> 32:43.670
I COULD SPEND ALL DAY
FIDDLING WITH THEM.

32:43.739 --> 32:46.239
THE WAY THEY WORK...

32:46.275 --> 32:47.307
IT'S LIKE MAGIC.

32:48.677 --> 32:50.243
OKAY.

32:54.683 --> 32:56.616
WE HAVE THIS CUCKOO CLOCK

32:56.652 --> 32:59.886
THAT HASN'T WORKED
SINCE WE BROUGHT IT IN.

33:01.590 --> 33:02.422
CAREFUL.

33:04.159 --> 33:09.562
THIS LITTLE DARLING
IS FINICKY AS ALL GET OUT.

33:09.598 --> 33:10.797
MAY I?

33:10.832 --> 33:11.798
SURE.

33:11.833 --> 33:13.700
THE SECRET IS,

33:13.735 --> 33:16.235
YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW
EXACTLY WHERE TO TINKER.

33:16.305 --> 33:19.406
YOU TOUCH
THE WRONG GEAR,

33:19.441 --> 33:21.574
AND YOU'LL BE FIDDLING
FOR HOURS.

33:24.680 --> 33:26.346
A CLOCK JUST LIKE THIS ONE

33:26.381 --> 33:29.148
HUNG IN
MY DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY,

33:29.184 --> 33:31.785
AND I COULDN'T WAIT

33:31.853 --> 33:33.553
FOR THAT LITTLE BIRD

33:33.622 --> 33:35.922
TO POKE HIS HEAD OUT

33:35.957 --> 33:38.891
ON... THE...

33:38.927 --> 33:40.493
HOUR.
[CUCKOO SINGING]

33:40.529 --> 33:41.461
OH!

33:41.496 --> 33:42.429
THERE HE IS!

33:44.733 --> 33:45.732
OH!

33:45.801 --> 33:47.300
I'VE GOT IT, YEAH.

33:47.336 --> 33:48.802
YEAH.

33:48.870 --> 33:51.404
WELL, UM...
THANK YOU, KENNETH.

33:51.440 --> 33:53.239
WE'LL BE IN TOUCH.

34:00.315 --> 34:02.716
I LIKE HIM.

34:02.784 --> 34:04.484
HE TOOK MY PEN.

34:36.851 --> 34:39.150
[KNOCKING]

34:39.187 --> 34:40.152
OH!

34:40.221 --> 34:42.655
MRS. SHANNON.

34:42.690 --> 34:44.891
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING BY TODAY.

34:44.926 --> 34:45.958
WELL, I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

34:45.994 --> 34:47.059
AND I THOUGHT I'D STOP BY

34:47.094 --> 34:47.860
AND MAKE SURE
I DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING.

34:47.896 --> 34:49.195
AH, WELL,

34:49.230 --> 34:50.764
I'VE GOT THE APPRAISERS HERE
ALL DAY

34:50.799 --> 34:52.998
GOING OVER THE HOUSE
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM.

34:53.034 --> 34:54.166
I'M SURE THEY'LL LET ME KNOW

34:54.202 --> 34:56.002
IF THEY COME ACROSS
A STRAY CAMERA.

34:56.036 --> 34:57.404
[LAUGHING]

34:57.439 --> 34:58.605
YOU KNOW,

34:58.673 --> 35:00.807
I NEVER DID GET TO ASK YOU
ABOUT YOUR CLIENT.

35:00.842 --> 35:03.242
WOULD HE LIKE TO CONSULT
ON HOW THE ITEMS ARE SOLD?

35:03.278 --> 35:05.211
SCOTT? NO, NO.

35:05.246 --> 35:08.180
HE'S NOT REALLY INTO ANTIQUES
THE WAY LARRY WAS.

35:08.249 --> 35:10.917
NO, I'M SURE HE JUST WANTS
A FAIR AND QUICK SALE.

35:18.126 --> 35:19.325
LARRY CERTAINLY WAS

35:19.360 --> 35:21.027
A DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING
GENTLEMAN, WASN'T HE?

35:21.062 --> 35:22.829
YES, HE WAS.

35:22.864 --> 35:23.696
THAT'S LARRY
WITH HIS OLD BUSINESS PARTNER,

35:23.732 --> 35:24.664
WALTER...

35:24.699 --> 35:26.232
IN HAPPIER TIMES.

35:26.267 --> 35:27.600
OH, RIGHT.

35:27.669 --> 35:30.202
I RECOGNIZE HIM
FROM THE OTHER DAY.

35:30.271 --> 35:31.103
HE SEEMED QUITE UPSET.

35:31.139 --> 35:32.539
MM.

35:32.574 --> 35:33.673
THEY HAD QUITE A FALLING OUT

35:33.708 --> 35:35.274
WHEN LARRY SOLD
THEIR INVESTMENT COMPANY.

35:35.310 --> 35:36.609
LARRY GOT
ENOUGH MONEY

35:36.645 --> 35:38.545
TO DO NOTHING
FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE,

35:38.580 --> 35:41.280
AND WALTER GOT...
A LOT LESS.

35:41.316 --> 35:42.882
THEY RECENTLY
RECONCILED

35:42.918 --> 35:44.050
TO INVEST IN
A NEW VENTURE...

35:44.085 --> 35:46.285
THAT IS,
UNTIL THE MONEY RAN OUT...

35:46.321 --> 35:48.655
BUT LET'S NOT
LET THAT STOP YOU

35:48.723 --> 35:49.489
FROM GETTING
THOSE CAMERAS SOLD,

35:49.524 --> 35:51.390
HMM?

35:51.426 --> 35:52.459
OH, UM,

35:52.494 --> 35:54.093
SPEAKING
OF CAMERAS,

35:54.128 --> 35:56.028
I HAD THAT FILM THAT
WAS IN THAT CAMERA

35:56.064 --> 35:56.930
DEVELOPED
THE OTHER DAY.

35:56.998 --> 35:58.364
IN A LAB IN TOWN,

35:58.399 --> 36:00.099
AND THE TECHNICIAN SAID
HE MIGHT BE INTERESTED

36:00.134 --> 36:01.033
IN PURCHASING
LARRY'S COLLECTION.

36:01.069 --> 36:03.536
OH, WELL,
THAT'S SOME GOOD NEWS.

36:03.572 --> 36:04.804
DO YOU BY ANY CHANCE KNOW

36:04.840 --> 36:06.172
WHERE LARRY GOT HIS FILM
DEVELOPED?

36:06.240 --> 36:07.841
IT COULD BE
ANOTHER POTENTIAL BUYER.

36:07.876 --> 36:09.241
MM, THAT'S SMART THINKING,

36:09.310 --> 36:11.010
BUT I REALLY CAN'T REMEMBER

36:11.079 --> 36:12.579
HIM MENTIONING
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

36:12.614 --> 36:14.681
YOU KNOW,
I'LL CHECK HIS FILES.

36:14.716 --> 36:17.083
DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
ANY STONE UNTURNED.

36:17.118 --> 36:18.250
YOU KNOW,

36:18.286 --> 36:19.652
TONY HAS DEFINITELY MADE
HIS SHARE OF MISTAKES

36:19.688 --> 36:20.954
IN THE PAST,

36:20.989 --> 36:23.322
BUT HE'S MADE A GOOD CHOICE
WHEN HE RECOMMENDED YOU.

36:23.391 --> 36:24.390
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,

36:24.425 --> 36:27.460
TONY HAS MADE HIS
SHARE OF MISTAKES?

36:27.496 --> 36:28.561
I'M SORRY.

36:28.597 --> 36:30.096
THAT WAS
INAPPROPRIATE OF ME.

36:30.131 --> 36:31.698
TONY, HE'S...
HE'S A GREAT KID,

36:31.733 --> 36:33.967
BUT HE LIKES TO DAYDREAM
ABOUT BEING A MUSICIAN

36:34.002 --> 36:35.635
WHEN HE SHOULD BE
FIGURING OUT HIS BASIC NEEDS,

36:35.704 --> 36:37.904
HIS FOOD,
HIS SHELTER.

36:37.973 --> 36:40.907
YOU KNOW, HE'S BEEN EVICTED
FROM SEVERAL APARTMENTS.

36:40.942 --> 36:42.341
LARRY TRIED TO HELP HIM OUT
ON OCCASION,

36:42.377 --> 36:45.411
BUT THERE'S ONLY
SO MUCH YOU CAN DO.

36:45.446 --> 36:49.716
YOU KNOW, I HAD COFFEE
WITH TONY EARLIER TODAY.

36:49.751 --> 36:52.284
HE HAS A LOT OF SUSPICIONS
AROUND LARRY'S DEATH.

36:52.320 --> 36:54.487
LET ME GUESS.

36:54.523 --> 36:56.455
THOSE SUSPICIONS POINT
TO HIS FATHER?

36:56.491 --> 36:57.924
YES.

36:59.594 --> 37:01.027
YEAH, NO, IT'S TRUE

37:01.062 --> 37:03.095
LARRY AND SCOTT DIDN'T HAVE
THE GREATEST RELATIONSHIP,

37:03.131 --> 37:05.431
BUT WHAT KIND OF MAN
WOULD KILL HIS OWN BROTHER?

37:22.966 --> 37:24.132
HEY!

37:25.568 --> 37:27.736
WHAT'S GOING ON?

37:30.473 --> 37:32.907
HOW DO YOU DO WHAT YOU DO?

37:34.277 --> 37:35.176
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
SELL ANTIQUES?

37:35.245 --> 37:36.611
NO.

37:36.647 --> 37:38.513
GET PEOPLE
TO OPEN UP TO YOU.

37:38.548 --> 37:39.347
YOU'RE LIKE
EVERYONE'S FRIEND.

37:40.617 --> 37:41.716
OH, GOSH, I DON'T KNOW.

37:41.752 --> 37:43.384
IT KIND OF COMES NATURALLY,

37:43.419 --> 37:44.719
BUT I THINK

37:44.788 --> 37:47.388
PEOPLE WANT
TO TALK ABOUT THEMSELVES,

37:47.423 --> 37:48.790
SO IT'S GIVING THEM
THE OPPORTUNITY,

37:48.859 --> 37:50.491
OPENING THE DOOR.

37:50.527 --> 37:52.260
RIGHT, BUT HOW DO YOU KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT?

37:54.297 --> 37:55.864
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

37:55.899 --> 37:57.699
I'VE LEARNED A LOT
FROM READING MYSTERIES.

37:57.768 --> 37:59.734
FROM EDGAR ALLAN POE

37:59.770 --> 38:01.703
TO AGATHA CHRISTIE,

38:01.738 --> 38:04.505
ALL THOSE STORIES ARE ABOUT
GETTING PEOPLE TO OPEN UP,

38:04.541 --> 38:05.907
FINDING OUT
WHAT THEY'RE ALL ABOUT.

38:05.942 --> 38:07.542
HMM...

38:07.577 --> 38:08.609
I'LL GIVE IT A TRY.

38:08.645 --> 38:10.712
O...

38:10.747 --> 38:12.047
OKAY.

38:18.521 --> 38:19.487
DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT
YOUR BREAKFAST.

38:20.924 --> 38:22.623
SPILL IT.

38:22.693 --> 38:23.558
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?

38:23.593 --> 38:24.693
SCOTT BRADY.

38:24.728 --> 38:26.294
THE VICTIM'S BROTHER?

38:26.329 --> 38:27.628
YES, I THINK
YOU SHOULD TALK TO HIM.

38:27.664 --> 38:28.863
WELL, I JUST SPENT
ALL DAY YESTERDAY

38:28.899 --> 38:30.732
GOING OVER THE GUEST LIST
OF LARRY'S PARTY.

38:30.801 --> 38:31.800
HE WASN'T ON IT.

38:31.835 --> 38:33.634
WELL, I TALKED
TO TONY BRADY AGAIN,

38:33.704 --> 38:35.336
AND HE THINKS HIS FATHER
MIGHT HAVE HAD SOMETHING TO DO

38:35.371 --> 38:36.171
WITH LARRY'S DEATH.

38:36.206 --> 38:37.638
MOTIVE?

38:37.674 --> 38:38.973
WELL, APPARENTLY,

38:39.009 --> 38:40.274
THERE WAS A LOT OF BAD BLOOD
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

38:40.343 --> 38:41.642
AND THEY HAVEN'T TALKED

38:41.678 --> 38:43.044
SINCE LARRY CUT SCOTT OFF
FINANCIALLY.

38:44.581 --> 38:45.446
AND YOU SPOKE WITH HIM?

38:45.481 --> 38:47.015
WHO, SCOTT?

38:47.050 --> 38:48.449
-YEAH.
-NO.

38:49.786 --> 38:52.053
SO THIS IS ALL SECOND-HAND
OR CIRCUMSTANTIAL AT BEST.

38:52.089 --> 38:53.421
AND I THOUGHT
I'D TELL YOU FIRST.

38:56.259 --> 38:57.592
ALL RIGHT, I'LL PUT
HIM ON THE LIST,

38:57.627 --> 38:58.659
BUT YOU, YOU...

38:58.695 --> 38:59.961
I'M GOING TO GO
BACK TO MY ANTIQUE STORE

38:59.996 --> 39:00.829
AND LET YOU
HANDLE THE CASE.

39:00.864 --> 39:01.763
YOU PROMISE?

39:02.799 --> 39:03.765
YOU BETTER DIG IN.

39:03.834 --> 39:04.665
YOUR EGGS ARE GETTING COLD.

39:08.772 --> 39:09.570
HEY!

39:09.606 --> 39:11.172
HI!

39:11.208 --> 39:12.573
PRODUCTIVE DAY?

39:12.609 --> 39:14.709
YEAH, WE HAD A COUPLE
OF GOOD CANDIDATES.

39:14.745 --> 39:16.410
ONE SEEMED LIKE
HE MIGHT BE A LITTLE...

39:16.479 --> 39:18.346
BUT NO,
HE'S GOT SOME GOOD QUALITIES.

39:18.414 --> 39:20.115
HMM...
HOW'S THE ARM?

39:20.150 --> 39:21.082
BETTER AND BETTER.

39:21.118 --> 39:22.483
HERE, ALLOW ME.

39:22.518 --> 39:23.451
OH.

39:23.486 --> 39:24.786
WELL, LOOK AT YOU GO.

39:30.627 --> 39:31.793
AH, CAN I HELP YOU?

39:31.862 --> 39:33.027
ARE YOU
JENNIFER SHANNON?

39:33.063 --> 39:33.995
I AM.

39:34.030 --> 39:35.830
I'M SCOTT BRADY.

39:35.866 --> 39:36.731
I WANT TO KNOW
WHY YOU'RE TELLING PEOPLE

39:36.767 --> 39:37.598
I KILLED MY BROTHER.

39:41.805 --> 39:44.172
MAYBE WE SHOULD SIT DOWN
AND DISCUSS THIS CALMLY.

39:44.207 --> 39:46.207
I KNEW SOMETHING WAS UP

39:46.276 --> 39:47.942
WHEN TONY STARTED
AVOIDING ME.

39:47.978 --> 39:49.110
IAN MENTIONED

39:49.146 --> 39:51.179
THAT HE HAD CONTACTED
A LOCAL ANTIQUE SHOP

39:51.214 --> 39:53.614
TO SELL
LARRY'S CAMERA COLLECTION.

39:53.650 --> 39:55.049
DIDN'T TAKE MUCH
TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

39:55.085 --> 39:57.385
OKAY, TONY CAME TO ME,

39:57.453 --> 39:58.319
AND HE SAID
THAT HE HAD SOME CONCERNS.

39:58.354 --> 39:59.320
CONCERNS?

40:01.191 --> 40:02.257
I DIDN'T KILL MY BROTHER!

40:02.325 --> 40:04.625
IS EVERYTHING OKAY OUT HERE?

40:04.661 --> 40:06.127
YES, EVERYTHING IS FINE.

40:06.196 --> 40:07.162
RIGHT, SCOTT?

40:07.197 --> 40:08.229
I WANT TO SEE THIS PHOTO.

40:08.265 --> 40:09.063
[DOOR OPENING]

40:10.133 --> 40:11.232
SCOTT!

40:11.268 --> 40:12.300
I WARNED YOU
NOT TO COME HERE.

40:12.368 --> 40:13.168
I'M VERY SORRY
ABOUT THIS.

40:13.203 --> 40:14.535
SHE WON'T SHOW ME THE PHOTO.

40:14.570 --> 40:16.137
I DON'T HAVE THE PHOTO.

40:16.173 --> 40:17.205
IT'S WITH THE POLICE.

40:17.240 --> 40:18.840
OKAY, COME ON,
LET'S LEAVE.

40:18.875 --> 40:19.908
YOU TELL THE POLICE

40:19.976 --> 40:20.875
THERE ARE
PLENTY OF PEOPLE

40:20.944 --> 40:21.776
WHO WANT TO SEE
LARRY DEAD.

40:21.812 --> 40:22.977
[IAN]:
ALL RIGHT, OKAY, OKAY.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.745
AS THE ATTORNEY,
I HAVE TO STOP THIS RIGHT NOW.

40:24.781 --> 40:25.680
GOOD DAY.

40:34.157 --> 40:35.890
[VIDEO GAME NOISES]

40:35.926 --> 40:37.525
WHATCHA PLAYING?

40:37.560 --> 40:38.526
JUST A FLIGHT SIM.

40:38.594 --> 40:40.295
HMM.

40:40.330 --> 40:42.030
YOU KNOW, AFTER READING
YOUR SCHOOL PAPER,

40:42.065 --> 40:43.664
I'VE SUDDENLY GONE
ON THIS OLD LITERATURE KICK.

40:45.501 --> 40:47.768
HAVE YOU EVER READ
"THE TELL-TALE HEART"

40:47.838 --> 40:48.536
BY EDGAR ALLAN POE?

40:49.639 --> 40:51.172
NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

40:51.241 --> 40:52.606
IT'S REALLY CREEPY.

40:52.642 --> 40:53.774
I THINK YOU'D LIKE IT.

40:53.844 --> 40:56.277
IT'S ABOUT THIS GUY
WHO KILLS HIS ROOMMATE

40:56.313 --> 40:58.112
AND CHOPS HIM UP.

40:58.148 --> 40:59.347
HE BURIES THE PARTS

40:59.382 --> 41:00.381
UNDER THE FLOORBOARDS
OF THEIR HOUSE.

41:00.416 --> 41:03.151
THAT SOUNDS PRETTY INTENSE.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.853
THE POLICE SHOW UP
TO INVESTIGATE,

41:04.888 --> 41:06.054
AND THEY END UP
SITTING IN CHAIRS

41:06.089 --> 41:08.089
RIGHT OVER THE SPOT
WHERE THE BODY IS HIDDEN.

41:08.124 --> 41:09.757
THEY'RE TALKING
TO THE MURDERER,

41:09.792 --> 41:11.025
AND HE BECOMES CONVINCED

41:11.061 --> 41:13.261
HE CAN HEAR THE HEARTBEAT
OF THE DEAD GUY,

41:13.296 --> 41:14.595
BEATING AND BEATING...

41:14.630 --> 41:16.530
UNTIL FINALLY,

41:16.566 --> 41:19.334
HIS GUILT CAUSES HIM
TO CONFESS HIS CRIME.

41:19.369 --> 41:20.501
OKAY, WELL, UH...

41:20.570 --> 41:21.903
I GUESS I DON'T HAVE
TO READ THAT ONE NOW.

41:21.938 --> 41:23.504
WELL, IT'S MORE ABOUT
THE POINT THAT POE IS MAKING,

41:23.539 --> 41:25.039
ABOUT SECRETS

41:25.108 --> 41:26.274
AND NOT BEING ABLE TO REST

41:26.309 --> 41:28.409
WHILE HOLDING
ONTO THOSE SECRETS.

41:28.444 --> 41:30.678
A LOT OF PEOPLE
CAN RELATE TO THAT.

41:30.713 --> 41:31.679
THEY DO?

41:31.748 --> 41:33.014
OH, YEAH.

41:33.049 --> 41:35.816
REMEMBER LAST WEEK,
WHEN MOM BAKED THOSE COOKIES?

41:35.852 --> 41:37.118
WELL, I ENDED UP
EATING THE LAST ONE,

41:37.153 --> 41:38.953
AND THEN I FOUND OUT

41:39.022 --> 41:40.088
THAT DAD
DIDN'T GET ANY,

41:40.156 --> 41:42.590
AND I FELT SO BAD
THAT I HAD TO TELL HIM.

41:42.625 --> 41:44.092
YOU KNOW,

41:44.127 --> 41:46.961
"TELL-TALE COOKIE" DOESN'T HAVE
QUITE THE SAME RING TO IT.

41:46.997 --> 41:49.297
IT'S DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE.

41:49.332 --> 41:50.865
IF YOU HAVE ANY SECRETS

41:50.901 --> 41:52.033
YOU NEED TO GET OFF
YOUR CHEST...

41:53.836 --> 41:54.769
NOPE.

41:54.804 --> 41:56.670
I'M FINE.

42:00.310 --> 42:02.377
I'LL LET YOU GET BACK
TO YOUR GAME, THEN.

42:10.553 --> 42:12.253
I'M TOTALLY FINE.

42:12.289 --> 42:13.922
DID HE THREATEN YOU?

42:13.957 --> 42:15.856
NO, ALL HE DID
WAS RAISE HIS VOICE A LITTLE.

42:15.892 --> 42:17.792
WELL, IF HE COMES IN AGAIN,
YOU CALL ME.

42:17.827 --> 42:20.428
WELL, IF HE SHOWS UP AGAIN,
I'M GOING TO CALL THE POLICE.

42:20.496 --> 42:22.063
THAT'S EVEN BETTER.

42:22.098 --> 42:23.464
I'LL BE SAFE, DON'T WORRY.
LOVE YOU.

42:23.499 --> 42:24.966
LOVE YOU, TOO.

JASON'S IN PROTECTIVE
HUSBAND MODE.

42:31.341 --> 42:33.607
IT'S KIND OF CUTE
WHEN HE'S LIKE THAT.

42:33.643 --> 42:35.109
IS HE GOING TO PROTECT ME, TOO?

42:35.145 --> 42:36.311
WE WILL BE FINE.

42:36.379 --> 42:38.212
ARE YOU LOOKING UP
BULLET-PROOF VESTS?

42:38.248 --> 42:39.680
NO...

42:39.715 --> 42:42.050
BUT I WAS THINKING
ABOUT SOMETHING SCOTT SAID

42:42.085 --> 42:44.953
ABOUT OTHER PEOPLE
WANTING LARRY DEAD,

42:44.988 --> 42:46.654
AND IT REMINDED ME
OF THAT FIGHT

42:46.722 --> 42:48.256
THAT LARRY'S
FORMER BUSINESS PARTNER

42:48.291 --> 42:49.991
WAS HAVING WITH IAN
AT LARRY'S HOUSE.

42:50.026 --> 42:50.959
WHAT WAS HIS NAME?

42:50.994 --> 42:52.560
WALTER.

42:52.595 --> 42:53.394
I DON'T KNOW HIS LAST NAME.

42:57.000 --> 42:58.799
OH.

42:58.835 --> 43:00.601
MM, I KNOW THAT LOOK.

43:02.172 --> 43:03.804
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU WANT TO TELL ME?

43:05.708 --> 43:07.741
WELL, I WAS GOING OVER
THE PEOPLE

43:07.777 --> 43:09.110
THAT JASON AND I INTERVIEWED,

43:09.145 --> 43:10.411
AND UNFORTUNATELY,

43:10.447 --> 43:11.512
THERE WERE ONLY TWO APPLICANTS.

43:11.547 --> 43:13.348
HUH.

43:13.383 --> 43:15.350
WELL, THAT SHOULD MAKE
PICKING SOMEONE EASY.

43:15.418 --> 43:16.617
[LAUGHING]

43:16.652 --> 43:18.353
YEAH, WELL, THEY BOTH HAD
THEIR GOOD QUALITIES

43:18.388 --> 43:20.154
AND THEIR WEAKNESSES.

43:20.190 --> 43:21.922
WELL, WHO'D YOU HIRE?

43:21.958 --> 43:22.890
BOTH.

43:24.527 --> 43:26.827
I KNOW, I KNOW.

43:26.896 --> 43:28.096
WE CAN'T AFFORD BOTH,

43:28.131 --> 43:29.663
SO THIS IS...

I DON'T WANT YOU
TO WORRY ABOUT IT.

43:32.102 --> 43:33.934

43:40.843 --> 43:42.710
YOU ARE RIGHT ON TIME.

43:42.778 --> 43:45.279
KENNETH,
TRAVIS,

43:45.315 --> 43:46.280
THIS IS
JENNIFER SHANNON,

43:46.349 --> 43:47.648
YOUR NEW BOSS.

43:47.683 --> 43:50.218
WE'RE GOING TO GO
RIGHT TO THE BACK,

43:50.253 --> 43:53.354
AND I'LL FIND SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO DO.

43:53.390 --> 43:55.189
WELCOME.

43:56.959 --> 43:58.526
OH, DANI...

44:34.630 --> 44:36.297
OH, HI, HONEY.

44:36.332 --> 44:38.099
HOW WOULD YOU LIKE
TO GO TO DINNER TONIGHT?

44:42.773 --> 44:43.972
I'VE GOT TO SAY, JENN,

44:44.007 --> 44:47.576
THIS SPONTANEOUS DATE NIGHT
IS A NICE SURPRISE.

44:47.645 --> 44:48.610
WHERE'D YOU GET
THE IDEA?

44:49.647 --> 44:50.879
OH, I THOUGHT

44:50.914 --> 44:52.113
A CELEBRATION
WAS IN ORDER

44:52.183 --> 44:53.815
NOW THAT THE INTERVIEWS
AT THE SHOP ARE DONE.

44:53.850 --> 44:55.617
WE ONLY DID
TWO INTERVIEWS.

44:55.653 --> 44:57.719
I WOULDN'T THINK
THAT'S A CAUSE FOR CELEBRATION.

44:57.754 --> 44:58.987
WELL, SOMETIMES,

44:59.022 --> 45:01.089
THE LITTLE VICTORIES
DESERVE SOMETHING, TOO.

45:02.626 --> 45:05.294
THAT HAD TO BE
A TOUGH CHOICE FOR DANI.

45:05.329 --> 45:07.095
TRAVIS, HE SEEMED
LIKE A HARD WORKER,

45:07.130 --> 45:09.298
BUT HE DIDN'T KNOW MUCH
ABOUT ANTIQUES.

45:09.366 --> 45:11.700
KENNETH,
HE HAD THE KNOW-HOW,

45:11.735 --> 45:13.802
BUT I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH LIFTING HE COULD DO.

45:13.837 --> 45:15.537
SO WHO'D SHE CHOOSE?

45:15.573 --> 45:16.471
BOTH OF THEM.

45:16.507 --> 45:18.940
BOTH?

45:18.975 --> 45:20.141
WELL, YOU DID SAY

45:20.211 --> 45:21.176
SHE HAD A HARD TIME
GIVING PEOPLE BAD NEWS.

45:22.746 --> 45:24.580
WELL, SHE'LL HAVE TO TALK
TO ONE OF THEM EVENTUALLY,

45:24.615 --> 45:25.914
BUT FOR NOW,

45:25.949 --> 45:27.349
WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM BOTH
A TRIAL RUN.

45:27.384 --> 45:28.684
SO SHE'S JUST DELAYING
THE BAD NEWS.

45:28.719 --> 45:29.651
EXACTLY.

45:29.687 --> 45:31.587
NOT A BAD PLAN.

45:32.623 --> 45:33.689
[TESS]: HELLO.

45:33.724 --> 45:35.657
I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A COUPLE NEW FACES HERE.

45:35.693 --> 45:36.825
GUILTY AS CHARGED.

45:36.893 --> 45:38.560
I'M TESS MEADOWS,
THE HEAD CHEF.

45:38.596 --> 45:39.728
HI, TESS.

45:39.796 --> 45:40.729
I'M JENN,
AND THIS IS MY HUSBAND, JASON.

45:40.764 --> 45:42.897
NICE TO MEET YOU.

45:42.933 --> 45:45.567
DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE MENU?

45:45.636 --> 45:47.469
EVERYTHING LOOKS SO GREAT.

45:47.504 --> 45:48.604
I'D LIKE TO ORDER ALL OF IT.

45:48.639 --> 45:50.672
[LAUGHING]

45:50.708 --> 45:54.008
UM, DO YOU HAVE
ANY LOW-SODIUM OPTIONS?

45:54.077 --> 45:55.244
SALT SUBSTITUTE
IS FINE.

45:55.279 --> 45:56.511
OH, ABSOLUTELY.

45:56.547 --> 45:58.012
WE CAN ADJUST ANY ITEM
ON THE MENU.

45:59.149 --> 46:00.616
HOW DID YOU FIND OUT ABOUT US?

46:00.651 --> 46:01.916
OH, I READ
AN ARTICLE ONLINE

46:01.985 --> 46:03.151
AND WANTED TO CHECK IT OUT.

46:04.521 --> 46:05.920
AND I CAME ALONG
FOR THE RIDE.

46:05.956 --> 46:08.957
WELL, TAKE YOUR TIME
STUDYING THE MENU,

46:08.992 --> 46:11.960
AND, UH,
JULIA SHOULD BE AROUND

46:12.028 --> 46:14.162
TO TAKE YOUR ORDER

46:14.197 --> 46:16.331
OR ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS,
IF YOU HAVE ANY.

46:16.367 --> 46:17.966
I SHOULD CHECK
THE KITCHEN.

46:18.034 --> 46:19.200
ENJOY YOUR MEAL.

46:19.236 --> 46:20.168
THANK YOU.

46:20.203 --> 46:21.670
THANKS.

46:24.841 --> 46:26.007
WATCHING OUR SALT, ARE WE?

46:27.378 --> 46:28.610
NEVER TOO SOON
TO START EATING HEALTHY.

46:31.415 --> 46:32.381
WHY DO I GET THE SENSE

46:32.449 --> 46:34.115
THAT THIS
"SPONTANEOUS DATE NIGHT"

46:34.151 --> 46:35.150
IS MORE THAN IT APPEARS?

46:36.587 --> 46:37.686
THAT...

46:37.721 --> 46:39.321
MIGHT REQUIRE
A LITTLE EXPLANATION...

46:40.724 --> 46:42.424
BUT FIRST,
I'M GOING TO WASH UP.

46:42.493 --> 46:43.825
WILL YOU ORDER ME
A ROSE?

46:43.860 --> 46:45.327
SURE.

46:48.899 --> 46:51.065
OH, BOY...

46:52.436 --> 46:54.903
[WALTER]:
SO WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU?

46:54.971 --> 46:56.805
[TESS]: IT'S NOTHING.
I'M FINE.

46:56.840 --> 46:58.206
TESS...

46:58.241 --> 47:00.309
YOU CAN'T HIDE IT
FROM ME.

47:02.078 --> 47:05.079
DAD, I'M WORRIED
ABOUT THE MONEY.

47:05.115 --> 47:07.048
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY
ABOUT THE MONEY ANYMORE.

47:07.117 --> 47:08.917
[TESS]:
WHERE DID YOU GET IT?

47:08.952 --> 47:11.219
SCOTT BRADY
CAME THROUGH.

47:11.254 --> 47:13.221
[TESS]:
HE GAVE IT TO US?

47:13.256 --> 47:14.790
IT'S PAYBACK.

47:18.562 --> 47:19.994
[WALTER]: YOU DON'T HAVE
TO WORRY ANYMORE, TESS.

47:34.077 --> 47:35.043
HI, HANNAH!

47:35.078 --> 47:36.110
HEY. IS MY MOM HERE?

47:36.146 --> 47:37.278
NO, HONEY,
I'M SORRY.

47:37.314 --> 47:38.313
SHE JUST STEPPED OUT.

47:38.382 --> 47:40.482
NO WORRIES.

47:40.517 --> 47:42.451
IS THERE ANYTHING
I CAN HELP YOU WITH?

47:42.486 --> 47:44.285
UH...

47:44.321 --> 47:45.253
YEAH, ACTUALLY.

47:46.990 --> 47:50.024
HOW DO YOU GET PEOPLE
TO OPEN UP TO YOU?

47:50.060 --> 47:51.693
OH...

47:51.729 --> 47:52.961
WELL...

47:52.996 --> 47:54.128
I'M KIND OF AN OPEN BOOK,

47:54.164 --> 47:56.531
SO I JUST START TALKING,

47:56.567 --> 47:57.999
AND THEN PEOPLE
START TALKING BACK.

47:58.034 --> 48:00.101
YOU MAKE IT
SOUND SO EASY.

48:00.136 --> 48:01.236
BELIEVE ME,

48:01.271 --> 48:03.104
I WISH I WERE BETTER
AT KEEPING SECRETS.

48:03.173 --> 48:04.539
IS THERE SOMEONE IN PARTICULAR

48:04.575 --> 48:05.841
YOU'RE LOOKING
TO CONNECT WITH?

48:05.909 --> 48:06.908
MY BROTHER.

48:08.178 --> 48:09.678

HE'S SO CUTE.

48:09.713 --> 48:10.679
WELL...

48:10.714 --> 48:12.714
I'D SAY IN THAT CASE,

48:12.750 --> 48:14.349
HONESTY IS HARD
TO SAY NO TO.

48:15.386 --> 48:16.818
YEAH.

48:16.854 --> 48:18.253
THANKS,
IT'S GOOD ADVICE.

48:19.423 --> 48:20.722
STILL NEED
TO TALK TO YOUR MOM?

48:20.758 --> 48:22.624
I WAS HOPING TO PICK HER
BRAIN JUST A LITTLE MORE.

48:22.659 --> 48:24.493
OKAY.

48:24.561 --> 48:26.361
I'LL LET HER BRAIN KNOW
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IT.

48:26.397 --> 48:28.096
THANK YOU. BYE.

48:28.131 --> 48:29.097
BYE!

48:34.671 --> 48:35.604

48:35.639 --> 48:37.372
HEY! HOW'VE YOU BEEN?

48:37.408 --> 48:39.173
I HAVEN'T SEEN YOUR BAND
PLAYING AROUND LATELY.

48:39.209 --> 48:41.810
YEAH, KIND OF
ON A BREAK

48:41.879 --> 48:43.712
WHILE I FIGURE
SOME STUFF OUT.

48:44.815 --> 48:45.680
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

48:45.716 --> 48:47.248
YOU SEEM...

48:47.284 --> 48:48.784
I DON'T KNOW, UPSET.

48:48.852 --> 48:50.385
THERE'S NOTHING
THAT YOU CAN DO.

48:50.454 --> 48:52.287
IT'S MY UNCLE'S DEATH
HAS MESSED ME UP A BIT.

48:52.322 --> 48:53.922
I HEARD ABOUT THAT.

48:53.957 --> 48:55.056
I'M SO SORRY.

48:55.091 --> 48:56.224
THANKS.

48:56.293 --> 48:57.292

OF WEIRDNESS

48:58.261 --> 48:59.561
SURROUNDING
HIS DEATH.

48:59.596 --> 49:00.862

A LOT OF STRESS

49:00.898 --> 49:01.963
IN MY FAMILY,

49:01.998 --> 49:03.532
AND IT'S BEEN HARD
FOR ME TO SLEEP.

49:05.068 --> 49:06.835
WELL, I HEARD
YOU'VE BEEN TALKING TO MY MOM.

49:06.870 --> 49:08.269
SHE'S BEEN
VERY HELPFUL.

SHE IS REALLY GREAT
TO TALK TO.

49:11.074 --> 49:13.975
BEEN TRYING TO LEARN
HOW SHE DOES IT.

49:14.010 --> 49:15.577
I'M SO SORRY
ABOUT HER RUN-IN WITH MY DAD.

49:15.612 --> 49:16.745
RUN-IN?

49:16.780 --> 49:17.779
YEAH.

49:17.848 --> 49:19.280
SHE DIDN'T TELL YOU?

49:19.316 --> 49:21.349
NO, IT'S THE FIRST TIME
HEARING ABOUT IT.

49:21.418 --> 49:22.751
MY DAD SHOWED UP HERE
YESTERDAY,

49:22.786 --> 49:24.853
AND HE CAUSED A BIT OF A SCENE.

49:24.888 --> 49:26.354
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THAT SHE WAS OKAY.

49:26.423 --> 49:28.089
I HAD NO IDEA.

49:28.124 --> 49:29.324
I'M SURE SHE'S FINE,

49:29.359 --> 49:31.927
I JUST... STILL WANTED
TO APOLOGIZE TO HER

49:31.962 --> 49:33.862
ON BEHALF OF MY FAMILY.

49:33.897 --> 49:36.465
WELL,
I WILL DEFINITELY TELL HER

49:36.500 --> 49:37.532
AS SOON AS I SEE HER.

49:37.601 --> 49:38.467
I'D WAIT AROUND AND
I'D DO IT IN PERSON,

49:38.502 --> 49:39.601
BUT THERE'S A LOT
OF THINGS

49:39.636 --> 49:40.735

TAKEN CARE OF, AND...

49:40.771 --> 49:42.136

SHUT OFF THIS MORNING.

WITH THE BILL.

I'LL HAVE HER CALL YOUR HOUSE.

49:47.143 --> 49:48.944

49:48.979 --> 49:49.978

WE'RE NOT ON THE BEST OF TERMS,

49:53.650 --> 49:54.983

THAT I'M SORRY,

A DARK SUIT AND GLOVES.

PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE HAD
A DARK SUIT AT THE PARTY.

OWED WALTER A LOT OF MONEY?

50:38.128 --> 50:39.794
LARRY OWED
A LOT OF PEOPLE MONEY.

50:39.830 --> 50:41.763

GOING TO GET PAID.

IT WAS "PAYBACK."

TO DINNER LAST NIGHT

50:55.345 --> 50:57.078
AT WALTER'S RESTAURANT.

THEN WHY AM I THE ONE

50:58.314 --> 51:00.081
STARTING TO FEEL
LIKE I'VE GOT INDIGESTION?

51:00.116 --> 51:02.183

USES POTASSIUM CHLORIDE

51:02.218 --> 51:03.852
AS A SALT SUBSTITUTE.

ARE WORKING TOGETHER?

51:11.895 --> 51:13.161

51:13.196 --> 51:14.996
SCOTT WAS ANYWHERE
NEAR THE MURDER SCENE.

51:15.032 --> 51:16.197
JUST BECAUSE
HE WASN'T AT THE PARTY

51:16.266 --> 51:17.465
DOESN'T MEAN
HE WASN'T ON THE PROPERTY.

52:32.595 --> 52:33.861
I MEAN... IT'S AN ANTIQUE.

52:33.897 --> 52:35.529

MANY OUT THERE.

52:35.564 --> 52:37.531
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
HOW LARRY HAD IT ARRANGED

52:37.600 --> 52:39.133
WITH HIS OTHER CAMERAS.

52:39.168 --> 52:40.601
I'M PUTTING TOGETHER A DISPLAY,

52:40.669 --> 52:42.403
AND I WANT
TO SHOW THE COLLECTION

52:42.438 --> 52:43.637
AS IT WAS INTENDED
TO BE SEEN.

52:43.672 --> 52:45.139
SO WHAT DO YOU NEED
FROM ME?

52:45.208 --> 52:46.507
I UNDERSTAND

52:46.542 --> 52:48.109
YOU WERE TAKING PHOTOS
AT LARRY'S PARTY,

52:48.144 --> 52:50.278
AND I WAS HOPING
I COULD SEE THE PHOTOS,

52:50.313 --> 52:51.845
JUST SO I COULD RE-CREATE

52:51.881 --> 52:53.414
HOW THIS CAMERA
AND THE OTHER CAMERAS

52:53.482 --> 52:54.282
WERE SHOWN AT THE HOUSE.

52:54.317 --> 52:55.849
I...

52:55.885 --> 52:57.118
I WOULDN'T BOTHER.

52:57.186 --> 52:58.485
NO?

52:58.521 --> 53:00.955
THAT CAMERA WASN'T YET
PART OF HIS COLLECTION.

53:02.758 --> 53:05.192
IT WAS
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

53:05.228 --> 53:06.160
OH.

53:09.265 --> 53:10.631
FROM YOU?

53:10.666 --> 53:12.466
YEAH.

53:12.501 --> 53:13.667
I GOT IT ONLINE.

53:13.702 --> 53:15.102
IT TOOK A LITTLE
SEARCHING,

53:15.171 --> 53:16.904
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS WORTH IT.

53:19.775 --> 53:22.209
SANDY, I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU KNOW THIS, BUT...

53:22.245 --> 53:23.744
ONE OF THE LAST PHOTOS
THAT LARRY TOOK...

53:24.847 --> 53:25.947
IT WAS OF YOU.

53:25.982 --> 53:26.914
REALLY?

53:26.950 --> 53:28.349
YES.

53:28.384 --> 53:29.350
IT'S A VERY NICE PHOTO.

53:29.419 --> 53:32.019
WELL, HE ALWAYS HAD
A GREAT EYE.

53:33.957 --> 53:35.289
WERE YOU AND LARRY...

53:36.392 --> 53:37.358
IT STARTED VERY INNOCENT.

53:38.428 --> 53:39.493
LARRY AND I MET

53:39.528 --> 53:42.296
IN A PHOTOGRAPHY WORKSHOP
THAT I TAUGHT.

53:42.332 --> 53:44.098
WE REALLY CONNECTED.

53:44.167 --> 53:45.532
HE KNEW I HAD A BOYFRIEND,

53:45.568 --> 53:47.501
BUT HE TRIED EVERYTHING
TO WIN ME OVER.

53:47.570 --> 53:50.972
SO THAT'S WHY HE HIRED YOU
TO TAKE PHOTOS AT HIS PARTY.

53:51.007 --> 53:52.806
YEAH,
IT WAS LIKE A GAME TO HIM.

53:52.842 --> 53:55.276
HE LIKED THE IDEA OF FLIRTING
WITH ME IN FRONT OF EVERYONE

53:55.345 --> 53:57.445
WHEN NO ONE
KNEW THE TRUTH.

53:58.681 --> 54:00.147
HE ALSO HIRED PETER
TO CATER THE EVENT...

54:00.216 --> 54:01.082
PETER, MY BOYFRIEND.

54:02.518 --> 54:05.987
LARRY,
HE LOVED HIS SECRETS.

54:07.256 --> 54:09.056
I'M SORRY.

54:10.259 --> 54:11.658
I'VE BEEN HOLDING ALL THIS IN.

54:11.694 --> 54:12.759
THERE WAS NO ONE ELSE
I COULD TALK TO.

54:12.828 --> 54:14.161
IT'S OKAY, REALLY.

54:14.197 --> 54:15.329
I UNDERSTAND.

54:15.365 --> 54:17.698
I GOT LARRY THE CAMERA
AS PART OF HIS GIFT.

54:18.868 --> 54:21.035
I WAS GOING TO TELL
HIM AFTER THE PARTY

54:21.104 --> 54:22.403
THAT I WAS LEAVING PETER,

54:22.438 --> 54:25.339
BUT...
THEN I FOUND HIM IN HIS STUDY,

54:25.375 --> 54:26.273
DEAD.

54:29.578 --> 54:31.379
DID YOUR BOYFRIEND, PETER,
KNOW ABOUT LARRY?

54:31.414 --> 54:32.546
NO.

54:34.217 --> 54:35.682
I MEAN, I DON'T THINK SO.

54:40.689 --> 54:41.855

54:46.962 --> 54:48.429
I HAD NO IDEA

54:48.464 --> 54:49.963
HOW WE'D GET THAT UP
FROM THE BASEMENT.

54:49.999 --> 54:51.399
NO PROBLEM.

55:07.650 --> 55:08.982

NEED TO FIGURE OUT

55:09.052 --> 55:10.518
IF PETER KNEW ABOUT LARRY.

55:10.553 --> 55:12.119
AND SINCE THE MAN WAS A CHEF,

55:12.155 --> 55:13.320
I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT
EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM

56:38.374 --> 56:39.440
YEAH.

56:39.475 --> 56:41.575
DON'T FOCUS ON WHAT'S MISSING.

01:01:47.176 --> 01:01:48.443
IT'S DAD'S OLD CAMERA.

01:01:48.478 --> 01:01:50.077
I WONDER IF THERE'S
STILL FILM IN IT.

01:01:50.112 --> 01:01:51.646
OH, BE CAREFUL,
THE...

01:01:51.681 --> 01:01:53.147
RELEASE LATCH
IS BROKEN.

01:01:54.250 --> 01:01:56.651
GUESS I RUINED
THE FILM, HUH?

01:01:56.686 --> 01:01:57.852
IT'S PROBABLY
FOR THE BEST.

01:01:57.887 --> 01:01:58.853
[HANNAH]: MM-HMM.

01:02:01.090 --> 01:02:02.990
GOOD MORNING!

01:02:03.025 --> 01:02:04.124
HI. IS IT ALL CLEAR?

01:02:04.160 --> 01:02:05.927
YES, I DID AN EXTRA LAP
AROUND THE SHOP

01:02:05.962 --> 01:02:07.562
JUST TO BE SURE.

01:02:07.597 --> 01:02:09.630
I CAN'T BELIEVE SOMEONE
WAS SNEAKING AROUND HERE.

01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:10.631
I KNOW.

01:02:10.667 --> 01:02:12.199
IT'S SO SCARY.

01:02:12.234 --> 01:02:14.401
GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS
JUST THINKING ABOUT IT.

01:02:14.437 --> 01:02:15.837
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

01:02:15.872 --> 01:02:17.605
OH, I'M TRYING
TO GET AHOLD OF TONY.

01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:18.706
I'M REALLY STARTING
TO WORRY ABOUT HIM.

01:02:18.741 --> 01:02:20.140
WHY, DO YOU THINK
THE SAME PERSON

01:02:20.176 --> 01:02:21.175
MIGHT BE
AFTER HIM, TOO?

01:02:21.210 --> 01:02:22.443
I WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED.

01:02:22.479 --> 01:02:24.411
I MEAN, TONY SAID
LARRY THOUGHT

01:02:24.447 --> 01:02:25.980
SOMEONE WAS AFTER HIM
RIGHT BEFORE HE DIED.

01:02:26.015 --> 01:02:27.648
COULD IT BE MR. SHOUTY
FROM THE OTHER DAY?

01:02:27.684 --> 01:02:29.617
TONY'S DAD.

01:02:29.652 --> 01:02:31.185
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN
WHY TONY DIDN'T WANT TO GO HOME.

01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:32.487
THERE'S ALSO
WALTER MEADOWS,

01:02:32.522 --> 01:02:33.921
THE FORMER PARTNER.

01:02:36.225 --> 01:02:37.558
JUST FOR THE RECORD,

01:02:37.594 --> 01:02:38.993
I WILL NEVER MURDER YOU.

01:02:39.028 --> 01:02:40.995
THANK YOU.

01:02:41.063 --> 01:02:41.896
THAT IS GOOD TO KNOW.

01:02:43.199 --> 01:02:44.599
THEN THERE'S IAN THE LAWYER,

01:02:44.634 --> 01:02:45.933
ALTHOUGH THE KILLER
WAS IN BLACK,

01:02:45.969 --> 01:02:47.935
AND IAN WAS DRESSED
IN A BLUE SUIT.

01:02:48.004 --> 01:02:48.936
YOU SAW A PICTURE
OF THE MURDER.

01:02:48.972 --> 01:02:50.505
YOU'D THINK
THIS WOULD BE EASIER.

01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:52.874
EXCEPT ALMOST EVERYONE
WAS IN A BLACK SUIT.

01:02:52.909 --> 01:02:54.542
WASN'T THERE
A JEALOUS BOYFRIEND?

01:02:54.577 --> 01:02:55.943
PETER.

01:02:55.979 --> 01:02:56.911
SO WHAT ABOUT
A CRIME OF PASSION?

01:02:56.946 --> 01:02:58.646
I ALWAYS PUT MY MONEY
ON THOSE.

01:02:58.715 --> 01:02:59.947
FRANK IS LOOKING
INTO THAT.

01:03:00.016 --> 01:03:01.248
YOU KNOW WHAT I DO

01:03:01.283 --> 01:03:03.117
WHEN I'M TRYING TO WORK
SOMETHING OUT IN MY HEAD?

01:03:03.152 --> 01:03:05.119
OH, DEAR,
I'M AFRAID TO ASK.

01:03:05.187 --> 01:03:06.186
I GO BACK TO THE BEGINNING

01:03:06.222 --> 01:03:07.522
AND WORK THROUGH IT
STEP BY STEP.

01:03:09.025 --> 01:03:10.725
WELL, I WOULD LIKE
TO GET BACK IN THAT STUDY.

01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:12.159
WHY DON'T YOU CALL IAN?
HE COULD LET YOU IN.

01:03:12.194 --> 01:03:13.661
BUT I'D NEED A GOOD REASON.

01:03:14.664 --> 01:03:16.296
YOU KNOW,

01:03:16.365 --> 01:03:18.699
I THINK WE LEFT A LENS
FROM ONE OF THE ANTIQUE CAMERAS

01:03:18.735 --> 01:03:19.667
THERE.

01:03:21.137 --> 01:03:22.202
YOU KNOW,
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:03:22.238 --> 01:03:23.504
YEAH.

01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:24.972
AND WE WOULDN'T WANT
TO LEAVE ANYTHING BEHIND.

01:03:25.008 --> 01:03:26.941
NO.

01:03:28.545 --> 01:03:29.911
A LENS?

01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:33.313
YES, OF COURSE.

01:03:33.382 --> 01:03:34.982
BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY.

01:03:35.018 --> 01:03:36.050
LET ME WRAP UP A FEW THINGS,

01:03:36.118 --> 01:03:37.418
AND I'LL MEET YOU
AT THE HOUSE.

01:03:37.453 --> 01:03:38.318
WELL, THANK YOU, IAN.

01:03:38.387 --> 01:03:39.921
I'M ON MY WAY.

01:03:39.956 --> 01:03:40.855
I'LL CALL YOU LATER.

01:03:40.890 --> 01:03:41.856
OKAY.

01:03:51.935 --> 01:03:53.467
IAN?

01:04:07.450 --> 01:04:09.050
IAN?

01:04:54.797 --> 01:04:56.664
[GASPING]

01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:58.499
HEY.

01:04:58.567 --> 01:05:01.368
TONY?

01:05:01.403 --> 01:05:03.938
THIS IS, UH...
IT'S NOT WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

01:05:10.146 --> 01:05:11.045
MRS. SHANNON?

01:05:14.150 --> 01:05:16.250
[TONY]:
WE'RE IN HERE.

01:05:21.357 --> 01:05:22.890
TONY?

01:05:22.925 --> 01:05:24.491
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

01:05:24.527 --> 01:05:26.060
WHAT IS THIS SPACE?

01:05:26.129 --> 01:05:28.129
IT'S UNCLE LARRY'S DARK ROOM.

01:05:31.167 --> 01:05:32.299
TONY, ARE YOU
LIVING HERE?

01:05:34.137 --> 01:05:35.402
BEATS LIVING IN MY VAN.

01:05:35.437 --> 01:05:36.971
FIGURED NO ONE
WOULD NOTICE.

01:05:37.006 --> 01:05:38.405
TONY,
YOU SHOULD HAVE CALLED ME.

01:05:38.440 --> 01:05:39.807
I DIDN'T WANT YOU
TO TELL MY DAD.

01:05:39.876 --> 01:05:41.909
YES, I HEARD
YOU TWO WERE FIGHTING.

01:05:41.978 --> 01:05:43.544
YEAH,
I JUST NEEDED TO GET AWAY.

01:05:45.214 --> 01:05:47.281
DOES ANYONE ELSE KNOW
ABOUT THIS ROOM?

01:05:47.316 --> 01:05:49.050
MY UNCLE SAID

01:05:49.118 --> 01:05:50.985
THAT THE ONLY PEOPLE
WHO KNEW ABOUT IT

01:05:51.054 --> 01:05:51.886
WERE THE CONTRACTORS
WHO BUILT IT,

01:05:51.921 --> 01:05:52.920
HIM, AND ME.

01:05:52.955 --> 01:05:55.856
YOU DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT?

01:05:55.925 --> 01:05:57.124
LARRY LOVED
HIS SECRETS.

01:06:03.566 --> 01:06:05.299
WHAT, AM I IN TROUBLE NOW?

01:06:05.334 --> 01:06:06.233
[IAN]:
YOU'LL BE FINE.

01:06:06.268 --> 01:06:07.902
DON'T WORRY.

01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.538
YOU SHOULD TELL HER
ABOUT THE MEMORIAL.

01:06:11.574 --> 01:06:13.607
GO AHEAD.

01:06:13.642 --> 01:06:14.909
[TONY]:
IT DIDN'T FEEL RIGHT

01:06:14.944 --> 01:06:16.343
THAT WE'RE NOT HONORING
LARRY SOMEHOW.

01:06:16.378 --> 01:06:17.678
SO IAN ARRANGED
TO HAVE A GATHERING

01:06:17.714 --> 01:06:19.714
HERE AT THE HOUSE
LATER TODAY.

01:06:19.749 --> 01:06:20.748
YOU'RE WELCOME TO COME.

01:06:21.617 --> 01:06:22.516
THANK YOU.

01:06:26.789 --> 01:06:28.823
SEEMS LIKE YOU GOT
IN A LITTLE TROUBLE HERE.

01:06:28.858 --> 01:06:30.191
DRUNK AND DISORDERLY.

01:06:32.195 --> 01:06:34.461
YEAH, I'M NOT PROUD
OF ANY OF IT.

01:06:34.496 --> 01:06:35.796
THAT'S GOOD
TO KNOW.

01:06:36.833 --> 01:06:37.965
CARE TO EXPLAIN?

01:06:40.302 --> 01:06:41.969
MY GIRLFRIEND...
SANDY...

01:06:43.639 --> 01:06:46.073
SHE BROKE UP WITH ME LAST NIGHT.

01:06:46.142 --> 01:06:47.608
SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

01:06:49.245 --> 01:06:51.212
TURNS OUT SHE WAS IN LOVE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

01:06:52.481 --> 01:06:54.581
IF YOU DON'T MIND ME ASKING,

01:06:54.617 --> 01:06:55.382
ANY IDEA WHO?

01:06:55.417 --> 01:06:57.551
YEAH...

01:06:57.586 --> 01:06:59.086
LARRY BRADY.

01:07:00.957 --> 01:07:03.224
SHE SAID
THAT HE STOLE HER HEART,

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:05.359
AND NOW
HE'S GONE FOREVER.

01:07:06.629 --> 01:07:08.062
HOW DO I COMPETE WITH THAT?

01:07:08.097 --> 01:07:09.696
I UNDERSTAND.

01:07:11.067 --> 01:07:11.766
SPEAKING OF COMPETITION...

01:07:13.736 --> 01:07:15.069
LARRY HAS A FINANCIAL STAKE
IN ONE OF YOUR COMPETITORS,

01:07:15.138 --> 01:07:16.036
ISN'T THAT RIGHT?

01:07:16.105 --> 01:07:17.738
THE MEADOWS?

01:07:17.774 --> 01:07:19.173
YEAH.

01:07:19.208 --> 01:07:20.340
I HEARD YOU
USED TO WORK THERE.

01:07:20.376 --> 01:07:22.309
YEAH, YEAH,
THEN I STARTED MY OWN COMPANY.

01:07:22.344 --> 01:07:23.778
ANY HARD FEELINGS?

01:07:23.813 --> 01:07:25.880
OH, A FEW.

01:07:25.915 --> 01:07:27.547
WALTER AND TESS
DIDN'T WANT ME TO GO.

01:07:27.616 --> 01:07:29.449
AND LARRY?

01:07:29.485 --> 01:07:30.617
HE HIRED ME FOR HIS PARTY.

01:07:30.686 --> 01:07:32.153
I THOUGHT
EVERYTHING WAS OKAY.

01:07:34.257 --> 01:07:36.723
AND YOU WEAR
WHITE CATERING UNIFORMS?

01:07:36.759 --> 01:07:38.692
MY STAFF WEAR WHITE.

01:07:38.727 --> 01:07:40.060
I WEAR BLACK.

01:07:40.096 --> 01:07:40.961
YOU KNOW WHO'S IN CHARGE.

01:07:43.699 --> 01:07:44.832
AT THE PARTY,

01:07:44.867 --> 01:07:47.268
WALTER COULDN'T STOP
COMPLAINING ABOUT LARRY,

01:07:47.303 --> 01:07:49.336
HOW MUCH HE WAS SPENDING
ON HIS BIRTHDAY.

01:07:50.807 --> 01:07:52.239
AFTER A WHILE,
I HAD TO EXCUSE MYSELF.

01:07:52.275 --> 01:07:53.707
I HAD ANOTHER EVENT ACROSS TOWN.

01:07:53.742 --> 01:07:55.075
ANYONE BACK THAT UP?

01:07:55.144 --> 01:07:57.178
THERE WERE AT LEAST
A DOZEN PEOPLE WHO SAW ME THERE.

01:07:59.748 --> 01:08:00.514
OKAY.

01:08:02.819 --> 01:08:03.784
NAMES, PLEASE.

01:08:03.820 --> 01:08:06.720
AS MANY AS
YOU CAN REMEMBER.

01:08:23.011 --> 01:08:23.977
HUH.

01:08:24.011 --> 01:08:25.144
THAT'S A COOL SHOT.

01:08:25.179 --> 01:08:26.712
KIND OF ARTY.

01:08:26.747 --> 01:08:29.916
YES, IT'S A NEW ART STYLE
CALLED "ACCIDENTAL".

01:08:29.951 --> 01:08:31.183
HERE, THIS PHOTO IS MUCH BETTER.

01:08:31.252 --> 01:08:32.283
SHOT ON PURPOSE, IN FOCUS,

01:08:32.319 --> 01:08:33.419
AND YOU CAN SEE
THE DETAILS.

01:08:33.453 --> 01:08:34.386
MM-HMM.

01:08:37.692 --> 01:08:38.758
[HANNAH]: WHAT?
DID YOU FIND SOMETHING?

01:08:38.792 --> 01:08:40.392
NOT SOMETHING,

01:08:40.428 --> 01:08:42.294
BUT... SOMEONE.

01:08:42.330 --> 01:08:44.430
RIGHT THERE,
THAT'S SCOTT BRADY,

01:08:44.465 --> 01:08:45.898
AND HE'S NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE THERE.

01:08:47.568 --> 01:08:49.502
I DON'T KNOW
HOW I MISSED THAT.

01:08:51.538 --> 01:08:52.238
YOU KNOW WHAT,
LOOK AT THE TIME.

01:08:52.273 --> 01:08:53.372
I'D BETTER GO

01:08:53.407 --> 01:08:54.473
IF I'M GOING TO MAKE IT
TO LARRY'S MEMORIAL.

01:08:54.509 --> 01:08:55.707
OH, TELL TONY I SAY HI.

01:08:55.743 --> 01:08:56.743
I HOPE HE'S DOING BETTER.

01:08:56.778 --> 01:08:57.977
ME TOO.

01:09:05.286 --> 01:09:07.120
JASON!
WHAT'S UP, MAN?

01:09:07.154 --> 01:09:08.287
OH, HEY, TRAVIS...

01:09:08.356 --> 01:09:09.220
I WOULDN'T YELL
ACROSS THE ROOM,

01:09:09.256 --> 01:09:10.389
IF I WERE YOU.

01:09:10.457 --> 01:09:11.457
DANI AND JENN,

01:09:11.492 --> 01:09:13.425
THEY PREFER
IF PEOPLE SPEAK QUIETER,

01:09:13.461 --> 01:09:14.727
IF POSSIBLE.

01:09:14.763 --> 01:09:16.828
IT HELPS WITH THE WHOLE
ANTIQUE-Y FEEL, YOU KNOW?

01:09:16.865 --> 01:09:18.330
THANKS!

01:09:18.399 --> 01:09:19.631
[QUIETER] THANKS.
GOOD POINTER.

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.068
WHERE'S DANI?

01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:22.969
YEAH, SHE AND KENNETH
ARE JUST...

01:09:23.004 --> 01:09:23.836
[GLASS SHATTERING]

01:09:27.008 --> 01:09:28.675
I'M SO SORRY.

01:09:28.710 --> 01:09:29.942
NO, IT WAS MY FAULT.

01:09:29.978 --> 01:09:30.810
I SHOULD HAVE
LET YOU KNOW

01:09:30.879 --> 01:09:31.778
I WAS BEHIND YOU.

01:09:31.845 --> 01:09:33.412
ARE YOU SURE?

01:09:33.481 --> 01:09:34.513
I FEEL TERRIBLE.

01:09:34.549 --> 01:09:36.448
IT'S FINE,
IT'S FINE.

01:09:36.484 --> 01:09:37.448
EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:09:37.518 --> 01:09:39.118
YEAH, IT'S JUST
A LITTLE ACCIDENT.

01:09:39.154 --> 01:09:40.787
THEY HAPPEN.

01:09:40.822 --> 01:09:41.821
HERE, LET ME HELP.

01:09:41.890 --> 01:09:43.488
NO, I WILL TAKE
CARE OF THIS.

01:09:43.524 --> 01:09:44.523
WHY DON'T YOU
GO OUT FRONT

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:45.992
AND SEE IF TRAVIS
NEEDS SOME HELP?

01:09:47.395 --> 01:09:48.761
-OF COURSE.
-OKAY.

01:09:53.466 --> 01:09:54.667
SO...

01:09:54.703 --> 01:09:56.202
HOW ARE THE NEW HIRES
WORKING OUT?

01:09:58.606 --> 01:09:59.906
BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM,

01:09:59.941 --> 01:10:01.373
THEY MAKE
ONE REALLY GREAT EMPLOYEE.

01:10:03.144 --> 01:10:05.211
TRAVIS NEVER GETS TIRED
OF MOVING THINGS,

01:10:05.246 --> 01:10:07.013
AND KENNETH IS SO GOOD

01:10:07.048 --> 01:10:09.481
AT HANDLING
AND CATALOGUING EVERYTHING.

01:10:09.517 --> 01:10:10.883
CAN YOU KEEP BOTH OF THEM?

01:10:10.919 --> 01:10:12.752
THE SHOP'S DOING WELL,
BUT IT'S NOT DOING THAT WELL.

01:10:15.656 --> 01:10:16.889
JASON...

01:10:16.925 --> 01:10:20.693
I KNOW YOU HAVE EXPERIENCE
WITH HIRING PEOPLE,

01:10:20.762 --> 01:10:21.627
BUT WHAT ABOUT...

01:10:21.662 --> 01:10:22.895
FIRING?

01:10:22.931 --> 01:10:24.563
[SIGHING] YEAH.

01:10:24.599 --> 01:10:26.599
IT'S NEVER FUN.

01:10:26.634 --> 01:10:27.767
YOU'VE JUST GOT
TO RIP IT OFF QUICKLY,

01:10:27.802 --> 01:10:28.801
LIKE A BAND-AID.

01:10:30.739 --> 01:10:32.504
I GUESS IT'S OBVIOUS
WHICH ONE OF THEM NEEDS TO GO.

01:10:34.542 --> 01:10:35.441
I'LL DO ANYTHING I CAN
TO HELP.

01:10:37.078 --> 01:10:37.977
THANK YOU.

01:10:41.116 --> 01:10:43.515
IT'S NOT...

01:10:43.551 --> 01:10:45.551
WHAT I MEANT.

01:10:52.927 --> 01:10:54.127
ALL RIGHT.

01:10:54.162 --> 01:10:55.995
I GIVE UP.

01:10:56.064 --> 01:10:57.897
I'M GUESSING THIS IS
GOING TO REQUIRE ME

01:10:57.932 --> 01:10:59.799
TO STOP MAKING
MY SANDWICH.

01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:01.901
YOU KNOW, AT FIRST,
IT WAS JUST FUN,

01:11:01.936 --> 01:11:03.269
TRYING TO GET YOU
TO TELL ME YOUR SECRET.

01:11:03.304 --> 01:11:05.204
MY SECRET?

01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:08.007
ABOUT WHY YOU WOULDN'T PUBLISH
YOUR TENNESSEE WILLIAMS PAPER,

01:11:08.076 --> 01:11:10.176
AND NOW...

01:11:10.211 --> 01:11:11.077
I'M GETTING
A LITTLE WORRIED.

01:11:11.146 --> 01:11:12.211
WHY ARE YOU WORRIED?

01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.713
YOU USED TO TALK TO ME,

01:11:14.749 --> 01:11:15.748
BUT NOW THERE'S SECRETS,

01:11:15.784 --> 01:11:17.016
AND YOU WON'T GET PUBLISHED,

01:11:17.051 --> 01:11:18.584
AND...

01:11:18.619 --> 01:11:20.552
I GUESS I'M JUST
A LITTLE WORRIED FOR YOU.

01:11:20.588 --> 01:11:22.421
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE WORRIED, OKAY?

01:11:22.490 --> 01:11:24.590
IT'S JUST...

01:11:24.625 --> 01:11:26.058
THERE'S THIS GIRL AT SCHOOL,

01:11:26.094 --> 01:11:28.727
AND SHE WROTE THIS
REALLY AWESOME POEM,

01:11:28.797 --> 01:11:30.596
BUT IF THEY PUBLISH MY PAPER,

01:11:30.631 --> 01:11:32.198
THEN THERE WON'T BE AS MUCH ROOM
FOR POETRY,

01:11:32.233 --> 01:11:34.000
SO...

01:11:34.035 --> 01:11:36.335
I'M JUST LEAVING IT OUT
SO HER POEM CAN GET PUBLISHED.

01:11:38.039 --> 01:11:39.038
THAT'S YOUR BIG SECRET?

01:11:39.073 --> 01:11:40.239
YEAH.

01:11:40.308 --> 01:11:41.340
YEAH, THAT'S IT.

01:11:42.811 --> 01:11:45.678
I JUST DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT AT FIRST BECAUSE I...

01:11:46.948 --> 01:11:47.814
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

01:11:51.752 --> 01:11:53.786
HER POEM DESERVES TO BE READ.

01:11:53.822 --> 01:11:55.554
TENNESSEE WOULD HAVE WANTED IT
THIS WAY.

01:11:57.992 --> 01:11:59.091
THANKS FOR TELLING ME, LOGAN.

01:12:01.729 --> 01:12:02.661
SO...

01:12:04.866 --> 01:12:06.165
WHAT ARE WE MAKING?

01:12:18.512 --> 01:12:19.445
MRS. SHANNON?

01:12:21.482 --> 01:12:22.448
MR. BRADY...

01:12:22.483 --> 01:12:23.282
I DON'T WANT A SCENE.

01:12:23.318 --> 01:12:24.783
I JUST WANT TO TALK.

01:12:26.520 --> 01:12:27.753
OKAY.

01:12:27.788 --> 01:12:29.488
I'M SORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED
AT YOUR STORE.

01:12:29.557 --> 01:12:30.456
I LOST MY TEMPER.

01:12:30.524 --> 01:12:31.891
I JUST...

01:12:31.926 --> 01:12:33.792
I WANTED YOU TO BELIEVE ME
THAT I'M INNOCENT.

01:12:33.828 --> 01:12:37.463
MR. BRADY, I WOULD LIKE
TO BELIEVE YOU'RE INNOCENT,

01:12:37.498 --> 01:12:38.597
BUT WHY WON'T YOU ADMIT

01:12:38.632 --> 01:12:39.966
THAT YOU WERE
AT LARRY'S BIRTHDAY PARTY?

01:12:40.001 --> 01:12:41.200
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

01:12:45.173 --> 01:12:46.172
THIS PHOTO.

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:47.439
THAT'S YOU
IN THE BACKGROUND.

01:12:51.246 --> 01:12:52.578
I DIDN'T GO TO HIS PARTY.

01:12:52.613 --> 01:12:55.214
I WAS HERE THAT DAY,
BUT NOT FOR THE PARTY.

01:12:55.250 --> 01:12:57.783
LOOK...

01:12:57.818 --> 01:12:59.718
I UNDERSTAND YOU HAD
A COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIP

01:12:59.754 --> 01:13:00.586
WITH YOUR BROTHER...

01:13:02.323 --> 01:13:05.657
BUT IF YOU WANT PEOPLE
TO BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE INNOCENT,

01:13:05.693 --> 01:13:06.893
YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO BE HONEST.

01:13:10.932 --> 01:13:13.266
I WENT TO THE PARTY
TO FIND TONY AND DRAG HIM HOME.

01:13:15.569 --> 01:13:17.203
EVER SINCE LARRY RETIRED,

01:13:17.238 --> 01:13:19.438
HE'S GOT HIMSELF INVOLVED
IN TONY'S LIFE--

01:13:19.473 --> 01:13:22.041
GIVING HIM MONEY,
TELLING HIM WHAT TO DO.

01:13:22.076 --> 01:13:23.542
IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT CONTROL
WITH LARRY.

01:13:23.577 --> 01:13:26.012
I, UH...

01:13:26.080 --> 01:13:27.380
I GOT MYSELF WORKED UP,

01:13:27.415 --> 01:13:30.482
THINKING ABOUT TONY
AT LARRY'S PARTY.

01:13:30.518 --> 01:13:31.984
THE BOY'S GOT TO LEARN
TO STAND ON HIS OWN.

01:13:33.587 --> 01:13:34.753
SO I CAME HERE
TO THE HOUSE

01:13:34.822 --> 01:13:36.389
AND I SNUCK AROUND THE BACK,

01:13:36.457 --> 01:13:38.857
AND WHEN I COULDN'T SPOT LARRY,
I WAS GOING TO MARCH INSIDE,

01:13:38.893 --> 01:13:40.359
BUT I RAN INTO IAN.

01:13:40.395 --> 01:13:41.360
HE MUST HAVE SEEN
THE LOOK ON MY FACE

01:13:41.396 --> 01:13:42.528
BECAUSE HE GOT ME
TO LEAVE WITH HIM.

01:13:44.432 --> 01:13:46.966
TONY MENTIONED
THAT YOU TWO WERE FIGHTING.

01:13:47.001 --> 01:13:48.634
I'M SURE
THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU WANT.

01:13:48.669 --> 01:13:50.803
I JUST WANT
TO MAKE EVERYTHING RIGHT.

01:13:50.871 --> 01:13:52.004
I NEVER WANTED LARRY'S MONEY.

01:13:52.040 --> 01:13:53.039
THAT'S WHY
I'M SELLING EVERYTHING,

01:13:53.074 --> 01:13:54.673
INCLUDING THE HOUSE.

01:13:54.742 --> 01:13:57.609
I'M CLOSING OUT
ALL OF HIS DEBTS.

01:13:57.678 --> 01:13:59.345
LIKE WITH HIS OLD PARTNER,
WALTER?

01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.147
ESPECIALLY WALTER.

01:14:01.215 --> 01:14:02.514
LARRY OWED HIM MORE THAN ANYONE.

01:14:04.085 --> 01:14:06.352
I WISH
I COULD JUST BUY MY SON BACK.

01:14:08.923 --> 01:14:10.289
MR. BRADY,

01:14:10.325 --> 01:14:12.724
I THINK IF YOU WANT
TO MAKE THINGS RIGHT WITH TONY,

01:14:12.760 --> 01:14:14.060
YOU SHOULD GO INSIDE.

01:14:14.095 --> 01:14:15.561
WHY?

01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:18.464
BECAUSE MAYBE
IF YOU CAN FORGIVE LARRY,

01:14:18.499 --> 01:14:19.432
TONY CAN FORGIVE YOU.

01:14:25.206 --> 01:14:26.105
ALL RIGHT.

01:14:27.175 --> 01:14:29.308
AFTER YOU.

01:14:33.848 --> 01:14:35.814
UH, MR. BRADY?

01:14:35.883 --> 01:14:37.183
I'LL CATCH UP WITH YOU
IN ONE SECOND.

01:14:37.218 --> 01:14:39.118
SURE.

01:15:11.052 --> 01:15:12.918
LISTEN, I'M GOING TO TEXT YOU
A PHOTO.

01:15:12.987 --> 01:15:14.286
THERE'S A CAR PARKED

01:15:14.322 --> 01:15:16.288
OUT IN FRONT OF LARRY BRADY'S
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

01:15:16.324 --> 01:15:20.859
IT HAS A YELLOW PAINT SCRATCH
ON THE FENDER.

01:15:20.928 --> 01:15:23.295
I THINK THE KILLER
MIGHT BE HERE.

01:15:51.759 --> 01:15:54.193
OH...
MAYBE THIS WAS A MISTAKE.

01:15:54.228 --> 01:15:56.995

01:16:03.938 --> 01:16:06.038
WE...

01:16:06.107 --> 01:16:07.739
SHOULD TALK...

01:16:07.775 --> 01:16:08.707
IN PRIVATE.

01:16:35.553 --> 01:16:37.153
SANDY,
ARE YOU OKAY?

01:16:37.189 --> 01:16:38.121
YEAH.

01:16:39.757 --> 01:16:41.490
I WAS JUST LOOKING
AT LARRY'S PHOTOGRAPHY.

01:16:43.695 --> 01:16:45.461
THIS ONE...

01:16:45.530 --> 01:16:46.930
IT'S ONE OF
MY FAVORITES.

01:16:46.998 --> 01:16:48.331
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

01:16:48.366 --> 01:16:49.498
YEAH.

01:16:51.369 --> 01:16:52.235
IS THAT YOU?

01:16:53.872 --> 01:16:54.871
YEAH.

01:16:56.774 --> 01:16:58.208
PHOTOGRAPHY REALLY DID
BRING YOU TWO TOGETHER,

01:16:58.243 --> 01:16:59.375
DIDN'T IT?

01:16:59.410 --> 01:17:01.410
HE ALWAYS SAID
IT WAS HIS SECOND LOVE...

01:17:01.446 --> 01:17:02.578
AFTER ME.

01:17:06.952 --> 01:17:07.984
SANDY,

01:17:08.053 --> 01:17:10.386
YOU REALLY SHOULD HAVE THIS.

01:17:10.421 --> 01:17:12.621
IS THIS THE PHOTO
THAT YOU TOLD ME ABOUT?

01:17:12.657 --> 01:17:13.923
IT IS.

01:17:13.959 --> 01:17:15.491
THANK YOU.

01:17:15.526 --> 01:17:17.493
IT'S THE LEAST
I CAN DO...

01:17:17.528 --> 01:17:18.694
BESIDES, YOU LOOK
SO BEAUTIFUL

01:17:18.730 --> 01:17:19.863
IN THAT BLACK DRESS.

01:17:20.765 --> 01:17:22.999
BLACK DRESS?

01:17:23.034 --> 01:17:24.334
NO, I WORE BLUE TO THE PARTY
THAT DAY.

01:17:26.037 --> 01:17:27.270
A BRIGHT BLUE.
I REMEMBER IT VERY WELL.

01:17:37.682 --> 01:17:39.249
IT'S A RED FILTER.

01:17:39.317 --> 01:17:40.850
THAT EXPLAINS IT.

01:17:40.886 --> 01:17:42.651
ANYTHING BLUE WOULD
SHOW UP AS DARK BLACK

01:17:42.720 --> 01:17:43.887
WITH THAT FILTER,

01:17:43.922 --> 01:17:45.154
LIKE THIS DRESS.

01:17:45.190 --> 01:17:47.357
OR A BRIGHT-BLUE SUIT.

01:17:47.425 --> 01:17:49.292

01:17:49.361 --> 01:17:50.393

TO SAY A FEW WORDS.

01:17:58.169 --> 01:17:59.068
I SHOULD GO.

01:18:00.105 --> 01:18:01.104

01:18:01.139 --> 01:18:02.105

YES.

01:18:07.879 --> 01:18:09.946

WITH THE GLOVES.

01:18:09.981 --> 01:18:11.247
I WISH I WOULD'VE
THOUGHT OF THAT.

AH, WELL,

THESE AREN'T MUCH PROTECTION
AGAINST THE WEATHER.

01:18:16.121 --> 01:18:17.620
THEY'RE DRIVING GLOVES.

01:18:17.655 --> 01:18:19.155
THE DEALER THREW THEM IN
WHEN I GOT MY NEW CAR.

01:18:20.225 --> 01:18:21.157
ARE YOU COMING?

01:18:21.192 --> 01:18:22.558
I--I AM.

01:18:22.593 --> 01:18:23.960

AND ALL THIS TIME,

01:19:02.633 --> 01:19:03.766
I THOUGHT IT WAS SOMEONE
IN A BLACK SUIT

01:19:03.801 --> 01:19:05.234
WHO WAS OUT
TO GET LARRY.

01:19:05.270 --> 01:19:07.503

I WAS NEVER OUT TO GET HIM.

LARRY ASKED ME TO HANDLE
SOME BUSINESS MATTERS FOR HIM,

01:19:12.643 --> 01:19:14.510
BUT...

01:19:14.579 --> 01:19:17.413
I ENDED UP HANDLING HIS MONEY
ALL THE WAY TO MY BOOKIE.

01:19:18.516 --> 01:19:19.849

01:19:23.688 --> 01:19:25.788
I DIDN'T KNOW
YOU WERE COMING BY.

01:19:25.823 --> 01:19:28.524
[JENN]: SO LARRY HAD NO IDEA
HE WAS BROKE, DID HE?

01:19:28.559 --> 01:19:29.558
HE HAD NO IDEA

01:19:29.627 --> 01:19:30.793
THAT YOU GAMBLED
ALL HIS MONEY AWAY.

01:19:30.828 --> 01:19:33.596
OH, HE SUSPECTED
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

01:19:33.631 --> 01:19:35.664
THAT'S WHY HE ASKED TO SEE
ALL OF HIS FINANCIAL PAPERWORK,

01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.933
AND I KNEW
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE.

01:19:37.969 --> 01:19:38.968
SO YOU KILLED HIM.

01:19:39.037 --> 01:19:40.103
I DIDN'T HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

01:19:42.773 --> 01:19:43.973

WELL...

01:20:01.226 --> 01:20:02.525
LUCKY FOR ME,

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:04.027
HE WAS TOO CONSUMED
WITH HIS OWN FAMILY DRAMA

01:20:04.062 --> 01:20:05.361
TO WONDER
WHAT I WAS UP TO.

01:20:05.430 --> 01:20:07.363
AND THEN YOU CAME TO MY STORE
TO TRY TO SCARE ME.

01:20:07.399 --> 01:20:09.965
I SAW THE SCRAPE
ON YOUR CAR.

01:20:10.001 --> 01:20:11.200
THE YELLOW PAINT
REALLY STICKS OUT.

01:20:11.269 --> 01:20:12.335
WELL,

01:20:12.404 --> 01:20:14.037
DON'T SAY
I DIDN'T TRY TO WARN YOU.

01:20:14.072 --> 01:20:15.338
[GUN COCKING]

01:20:16.374 --> 01:20:17.940
BY THE WAY...

01:20:17.975 --> 01:20:19.608
DID I MENTION...

01:20:19.677 --> 01:20:20.543
THIS ROOM IS SOUNDPROOF.

01:20:20.578 --> 01:20:21.511
[PHONE RINGING]

01:20:22.847 --> 01:20:23.779
[GUN FIRING]

01:20:26.584 --> 01:20:28.518
FREEZE.

01:20:28.586 --> 01:20:30.786
PUT DOWN THE GUN.

01:20:34.526 --> 01:20:35.558
YEAH.

01:20:36.794 --> 01:20:37.693
WHOA...

01:20:46.104 --> 01:20:48.404
I GUESS YOU GOT MY VOICEMAIL.

01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.672
I RAN THE PLATES.

01:20:49.707 --> 01:20:51.307
WHEN I SAW IAN'S NAME,

01:20:51.342 --> 01:20:52.875
I COULDN'T GET HERE
FAST ENOUGH.

01:20:52.910 --> 01:20:54.743
GIVE ME FIVE MINUTES
ALONE WITH HIM.

01:20:54.779 --> 01:20:55.844
MAYBE DON'T SAY
THAT STUFF

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:56.812
WHEN I'M HERE.

01:20:56.847 --> 01:20:58.081
IT'LL BE OKAY.

01:20:58.116 --> 01:20:59.315
HE'S GOING TO GET
WHAT HE DESERVES.

01:20:59.384 --> 01:21:00.983
WE SHOULD HEAD HOME.

01:21:01.018 --> 01:21:02.051
ONE SECOND.

01:21:02.120 --> 01:21:03.453
I JUST WANT TO TALK
TO MRS. SHANNON.

01:21:03.488 --> 01:21:04.720
SURE.

01:21:04.755 --> 01:21:06.689
I'LL WAIT FOR YOU
IN THE CAR.

01:21:06.724 --> 01:21:08.224
DID YOU GET A CHANCE
TO SPEAK WITH HIM?

01:21:08.293 --> 01:21:09.459
YEAH.

01:21:09.494 --> 01:21:10.659
THINGS AREN'T PERFECT,

01:21:10.695 --> 01:21:12.861
BUT I THINK I UNDERSTAND HIM
A BIT BETTER NOW.

01:21:12.897 --> 01:21:14.530
THANKS.

01:21:14.599 --> 01:21:16.065
GOOD LUCK.

01:21:21.005 --> 01:21:22.605
YOU SOLVE A MURDER

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.340
AND HEAL A FAMILY.

01:21:24.375 --> 01:21:25.608
NOT BAD FOR
A DAY'S WORK.

01:21:25.643 --> 01:21:27.910
WELL, I'M JUST GLAD
YOU SHOWED UP WHEN YOU DID.

01:21:27.945 --> 01:21:29.979
I SHUDDER TO THINK
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED.

01:21:30.014 --> 01:21:31.046
GOOD.

01:21:31.116 --> 01:21:32.582
DON'T THINK ABOUT IT.

01:21:32.617 --> 01:21:35.251
WELL, I'M GOING BACK
TO MY NICE, SAFE ANTIQUES.

01:21:35.320 --> 01:21:37.286
NOW, THERE'S A PLAN
I CAN GET BEHIND.

01:21:40.258 --> 01:21:42.492
IAN HATHAWAY SWAPPED
HIS BLUE SUIT

01:21:42.527 --> 01:21:43.593
FOR AN ORANGE UNIFORM.

01:21:43.628 --> 01:21:44.793
GUESS WHO'S LOOKING
FOR A LAWYER NOW?

01:21:46.598 --> 01:21:47.863
I TALKED TO TONY.

01:21:47.898 --> 01:21:49.365
HE SAID HE'S MOVING BACK IN
WITH HIS FATHER,

01:21:49.434 --> 01:21:51.534
AND HIS BAND
IS REHEARSING AGAIN.

01:21:51.569 --> 01:21:53.068
MAYBE YOU AND I CAN GO
SEE ONE OF THEIR SHOWS.

01:21:53.138 --> 01:21:54.370
OH, THAT
WOULD BE GREAT,

01:21:54.439 --> 01:21:55.605
ALTHOUGH FOR NOW,

01:21:55.640 --> 01:21:57.440
I'M LOOKING FORWARD
TO GETTING BACK TO THE STORE

01:21:57.509 --> 01:21:58.541
AND TACKLING THAT INVENTORY.

01:21:58.576 --> 01:21:59.675
HEY, DID YOU GUYS DECIDE

01:21:59.710 --> 01:22:02.311
ON WHICH EMPLOYEE
WE'RE GOING TO KEEP?

01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:04.247
WELL, ACTUALLY,

01:22:04.315 --> 01:22:06.115
I THOUGHT DANI WAS
GOING TO FIRE TRAVIS,

01:22:06.151 --> 01:22:07.883
SO I GOT HIM A JOB
WITH A CONSTRUCTION COMPANY.

01:22:07.918 --> 01:22:09.218
SEE, I THOUGHT

01:22:09.254 --> 01:22:10.219
THAT JASON WAS GOING
TO FIRE KENNETH,

01:22:10.255 --> 01:22:11.354
SO I MADE A CALL,

01:22:11.389 --> 01:22:13.656
AND NOW HE'S A DOCENT
AT THE HISTORY MUSEUM.

01:22:13.724 --> 01:22:14.957
OH, SO WHAT
YOU'RE TELLING ME

01:22:15.026 --> 01:22:15.824
IS WE DON'T
HAVE ANY HELP?

01:22:15.860 --> 01:22:17.026
NO.

01:22:17.061 --> 01:22:18.194
I GUESS WE COULD HAVE
COORDINATED BETTER.

01:22:18.263 --> 01:22:19.562
[DANI]: FORTUNATELY,

01:22:19.597 --> 01:22:20.763
DREW WAS THERE
TO RESCUE ME.

01:22:20.798 --> 01:22:21.764
LUCKY FOR EVERYONE,

01:22:21.832 --> 01:22:22.865
I WAS SITTING
AT MY OWN SHOP

01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:23.966
WITHOUT ANYTHING
HEAVY TO MOVE,

01:22:24.001 --> 01:22:24.900
LOOKING FOR
AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:22:24.935 --> 01:22:26.769
WELL, THANK YOU, DREW.

01:22:26.837 --> 01:22:28.371
HEY, I HEAR
YOU ARE QUITE A WRITER.

01:22:28.406 --> 01:22:29.605
[LOGAN]:
UH, YEAH.

01:22:29.641 --> 01:22:32.275
IT'S JUST FOR
A SCHOOL ASSIGNMENT.

01:22:32.343 --> 01:22:33.309
[HANNAH]:
HE'S BEING MODEST.

01:22:33.344 --> 01:22:35.645
NOT ONLY
WAS HIS PAPER INCREDIBLE,

01:22:35.680 --> 01:22:37.280
HE'S DOING WHAT HE CAN
TO HELP OUT A CLASSMATE.

01:22:38.516 --> 01:22:39.649
I TOLD THE GIRL TODAY

01:22:39.684 --> 01:22:41.950
THAT HER POEM'S GOING
TO GET PUBLISHED.

01:22:41.986 --> 01:22:43.352
SHE GAVE ME THIS NOTE.

01:22:43.388 --> 01:22:45.321
[SALLY]:
THAT'S GREAT.

01:22:45.356 --> 01:22:46.455
LOGAN, I WOULD LOVE
TO READ YOUR PIECE,

01:22:46.491 --> 01:22:47.756
EVEN IF IT'S NOT
BEING PUBLISHED.

01:22:47.792 --> 01:22:49.358
SURE, MOM,

01:22:49.394 --> 01:22:51.060
BUT IT'S NOT STAYING
UNPUBLISHED.

01:22:51.128 --> 01:22:52.328
HANNAH ENCOURAGED ME,

01:22:52.363 --> 01:22:55.030
SO I SUBMITTED IT TO
THIS THEATER WEB SITE,

01:22:55.066 --> 01:22:56.532
AND THEY PUT IT UP ONLINE

01:22:57.602 --> 01:22:59.835
WOW! YOU'RE FAMOUS.

01:22:59.870 --> 01:23:01.571

01:23:01.606 --> 01:23:03.939
THAT'S GREAT, SON,

01:23:03.974 --> 01:23:05.474
AND HEY, I HAVE
A SURPRISE FOR EVERYONE.

01:23:05.543 --> 01:23:06.409
IT'S WAITING FOR US
IN THE LIVING ROOM

01:23:06.444 --> 01:23:08.244
WHEN WE'RE DONE EATING.

01:23:09.480 --> 01:23:11.280
WELL, NOW,

01:23:11.316 --> 01:23:13.182

[JASON]: COURSE.

01:23:21.292 --> 01:23:22.958
GENTLEMEN

01:23:22.993 --> 01:23:23.892
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

01:23:23.928 --> 01:23:25.361
I DON'T KNOW.

01:23:25.396 --> 01:23:26.929
I HAVE NO IDEA.

01:23:28.333 --> 01:23:29.398

01:23:31.969 --> 01:23:33.202
AS YOU KNOW,

01:23:33.271 --> 01:23:34.803
LOGAN FOUND MY OLD CAMERA

01:23:34.872 --> 01:23:36.872
AND I DECIDED IT'S TIME
TO INVEST IN A NEW ONE.

01:23:36.907 --> 01:23:37.973
IT'S ALL DIGITAL.

01:23:38.008 --> 01:23:40.610

SALVAGED A COUPLE OF PICTURES.

01:23:48.519 --> 01:23:49.985
