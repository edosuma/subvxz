[applause]

01:45.806 --> 01:47.072
LUCE:
So even though

01:47.074 --> 01:48.907
it appears as if
an evening like this

01:48.909 --> 01:51.276
is meant to honor us
for our academic achievements,

01:51.278 --> 01:54.079
I instead ask
my fellow classmates

01:54.081 --> 01:56.281
to honor the generals
that lead us.

01:56.283 --> 01:58.717
Without our parents
and our teachers,

01:58.719 --> 02:00.919
we would be troops
unprepared for the battles

02:00.921 --> 02:02.821
that lay ahead of us.

02:03.824 --> 02:05.991
We know the road won't be easy.

02:07.394 --> 02:09.828
But with your love
and your faith,

02:09.830 --> 02:11.697
we can be certain
we'll find a way.

02:13.167 --> 02:15.334
So I hope it's not going
too far out of line

02:15.336 --> 02:17.236
to ask my classmates to rise...

02:18.806 --> 02:23.142
and to take this opportunity
to thank you...

02:23.144 --> 02:25.444
our teachers...

02:25.446 --> 02:27.146
and our parents...

02:27.148 --> 02:30.516
for helping us become
who we're meant to be.

02:30.518 --> 02:36.989
[applause]

02:42.863 --> 02:45.464
I hope you enjoyed that
because tomorrow

02:45.466 --> 02:47.199
we'll be back
to driving you crazy.

02:47.201 --> 02:49.568
[laughter]

02:50.471 --> 02:51.937
It was incredible.

02:51.939 --> 02:54.139
Here's my question:
How do we clone this guy?

02:54.141 --> 02:56.175
[laughter]
How do we clone him?

02:56.177 --> 02:57.276
Great job.

02:57.278 --> 02:59.011
Thank you.
WOMAN: Excuse me.

02:59.013 --> 03:01.046
Mr. and Mr. Edgar?
LUCE: Ms. Wilson!

03:01.048 --> 03:02.514
Guys, this is Ms. Wilson,

03:02.516 --> 03:04.183
my history
and government teacher.

03:04.185 --> 03:05.551
A pleasure.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.052
We've heard
so much about you.

03:07.054 --> 03:08.954
Have you?
Well, your class.

03:08.956 --> 03:10.822
Luce can't stop
talking about it.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.457
Is that so?

03:12.459 --> 03:15.060
Ms. Wilson's tough,
but still one of my favorites.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.228
Did you like my speech?

03:16.230 --> 03:17.362
I did.

03:17.364 --> 03:18.830
Ms. Wilson's
always saying

03:18.832 --> 03:20.899
we should speak our minds
no matter the cost.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.801
Amen to that.

03:22.803 --> 03:24.836
Well, it's great
to finally meet you.

03:24.838 --> 03:26.972
You too.

03:26.974 --> 03:29.208
Luce is, uh, one of our best.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.677
He's an important
example to the school.

03:31.679 --> 03:32.844
We're very
proud of him.

03:32.846 --> 03:34.346
You should be.

03:34.348 --> 03:35.314
[Amy chuckles]

03:37.151 --> 03:39.084
Excuse me. Dan...

03:40.888 --> 03:42.821
LUCE:
I don't want
to give another one.

03:42.823 --> 03:45.224
Why? It makes sense
they asked you.

03:45.226 --> 03:46.558
You did
a great job.

03:46.560 --> 03:48.427
I literally just
gave a speech.

03:48.429 --> 03:50.329
The more public
speaking you do,

03:50.331 --> 03:51.964
the better it'll look
for college.

03:53.234 --> 03:54.833
You told them you'd do it,
right?

03:56.503 --> 03:58.103
What do you think?

03:58.105 --> 03:59.171
[Amy chuckles]

04:00.374 --> 04:02.107
So Ms. Wilson seems nice.

04:03.177 --> 04:05.010
Stern...

04:05.012 --> 04:07.012
Don't you mean a bitch?
Peter!

04:07.014 --> 04:09.948
When people say stern, they
mean bitch. You meant bitch.

04:09.950 --> 04:11.850
You didn't want to say bitch
No, I said stern.

04:11.852 --> 04:14.219
because you didn't want
to be politically incorrect

04:14.221 --> 04:15.887
but you meant bitch.
No.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.789
I know what stern
means, thank you.

04:17.791 --> 04:19.057
She is a bitch though.

04:19.059 --> 04:20.425
AMY:
Can we not denigrate a woman

04:20.427 --> 04:22.427
who probably had
to assume characteristics

04:22.429 --> 04:24.396
[snores]
[laughing] in order to attain

04:24.398 --> 04:27.132
a leadership role?

04:27.134 --> 04:29.801
Anyway, I thought you said
it was your favorite class.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.537
I like the subject.
He liked the subject.

04:32.539 --> 04:35.307
In spite of
the bitch thing.

04:35.309 --> 04:38.644
Okay, it's fine to
criticize powerful women.

04:38.646 --> 04:41.813
Just don't use
the sexist language.

04:41.815 --> 04:43.715
Strung together copy.

04:45.085 --> 04:47.552
PETER: Oh! Nice!

[keyboard clacking]

05:02.970 --> 05:04.136
[knocking at door]

05:08.075 --> 05:10.242
You should make it
personal.

05:10.244 --> 05:11.677
What?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.278
The next speech
they want you to give,

05:13.280 --> 05:14.479
make it about you.

05:16.250 --> 05:17.683
Okay. [chuckles]

05:19.253 --> 05:20.485
And listen...

05:22.690 --> 05:24.756
You're a really good
public speaker

05:24.758 --> 05:27.192
and you're an
excellent debater.

05:27.194 --> 05:28.994
But you have
your own story to tell

05:28.996 --> 05:30.495
and I think
you should tell it.

05:30.497 --> 05:32.864
It gives people
something to grab onto.

05:34.668 --> 05:36.335
Am I overstepping?

05:37.838 --> 05:39.604
It's good advice.
[chuckles]

05:40.474 --> 05:41.773
Just want to be helpful.

05:41.775 --> 05:42.741
You are.

05:44.945 --> 05:46.611
I'm going to get
back to work now.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.681
Okay.

05:52.486 --> 05:53.952
[both chuckle awkwardly]

05:55.789 --> 05:57.556
Sorry for interrupting.

ORLICKI: Whoa!

06:13.340 --> 06:14.973
You're gonna lose
a limb like that.

06:14.975 --> 06:16.641
See my trig textbook?
I stashed it here yesterday.

06:16.643 --> 06:18.543
No, it's not here, Orlicki.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.911
Fuck me.
You do realize

06:19.913 --> 06:21.580
everyone gets their
own locker, right?

06:21.582 --> 06:23.148
Mine's on the other
side of the building,

06:23.150 --> 06:26.585
makes me late all the time.
Ah, shit! Orlicki!

06:26.587 --> 06:29.721
Heard our boy here got asked to
give another speech last night?

06:29.723 --> 06:31.490
Seriously?
Oh, motherfucking

06:31.492 --> 06:33.392
Nelson Mandela over here!

06:33.394 --> 06:35.026
I don't get why
I never get asked.

06:35.028 --> 06:36.528
'cause you're a C+ student.

06:36.530 --> 06:38.830
The entire speech would be
about porn and blunts.

06:38.832 --> 06:40.399
ORLICKI: Ah! Fair enough.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.234

06:45.773 --> 06:48.340
Stephanie Kim, what's good?
Let's go.

06:49.576 --> 06:51.343
Why you staring at Luce,
Stephanie?

06:51.345 --> 06:52.544
I'm talking to you.

06:52.546 --> 06:54.212
Not everyone likes
your big mouth.

06:54.214 --> 06:55.447
Your mama does.

06:55.449 --> 06:56.848
She loves my big mouth.

06:56.850 --> 06:58.550
Loves it all
over that pussy!

06:58.552 --> 07:00.852
Man, you're so gross!

07:00.854 --> 07:02.554
Sorry, bro.

07:02.556 --> 07:04.589
Hey yo, I'll see you
all at practice.

FEMALE STUDENT:
A law is a law.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.696
Pole-tests used to be law.

07:11.698 --> 07:13.732
So was segregation.
Red lining.

07:13.734 --> 07:15.467
FEMALE STUDENT:
That's not the same.

07:15.469 --> 07:17.035
Explain why.

07:17.037 --> 07:18.470
FEMALE STUDENT:
It's just not.

07:18.472 --> 07:20.071
Things were
different back then.

07:20.073 --> 07:21.373
Different how?

07:21.375 --> 07:23.542
Well, like that was
a different time.

07:23.544 --> 07:24.943
Social norms were different.

07:24.945 --> 07:26.478
People's expectations,

07:26.480 --> 07:27.779
their attitudes...

07:34.455 --> 07:36.455
MS. WILSON:
Is this not important to you?

07:38.659 --> 07:39.658
Well?

07:40.494 --> 07:41.827
It is.

07:41.829 --> 07:43.962
You might want
to speak more clearly.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.063
I can't hear you.

07:46.834 --> 07:48.467
It is.

07:48.469 --> 07:51.736
Keep in mind,
that for her,

07:51.738 --> 07:53.772
this knowledge is
incidental but for you

07:53.774 --> 07:55.407
it can be
life or death.

07:55.409 --> 07:58.243
So you might want
to treat this material

07:58.245 --> 08:01.179
with the seriousness
it deserves, Mr. Meeks.

08:09.790 --> 08:13.625
Which reminds me,
I'm almost done

08:13.627 --> 08:15.694
grading your assignments.
I apologize,

08:15.696 --> 08:17.796
it's taking me a little
longer than usual but,

08:17.798 --> 08:19.130
you'll have them
back soon.

Let's have a look in here.
Okay...

08:44.391 --> 08:46.825
Let's see...
He-he! That feels funny!

08:46.827 --> 08:48.226
Oh yeah?

08:48.228 --> 08:49.494
What about that?
[laughs]

08:49.496 --> 08:51.696
Does that feel funny?
[laughs]

08:51.698 --> 08:53.665
Hey.

08:53.667 --> 08:56.334
How do you feel about
a weekend trip to Cornell?

08:56.336 --> 08:58.036
PETER: <i> This weekend? </i>
Yeah.

08:58.038 --> 09:01.139

a call and get Luce some

Oh my God!
PETER: <i> If you don't want to go,</i>

09:09.516 --> 09:11.216
<i> you should have said, right?</i>

09:11.218 --> 09:14.252
Yeah, well, it's not that
I don't want to go. I mean,

09:14.254 --> 09:16.988
<i> I don't want to go, but-- </i>
No, you just hate babies.

09:16.990 --> 09:18.523
AMY:
<i> I do not hate babies.</i>

09:18.525 --> 09:20.559
PETER:
I mean, I love babies!

09:20.561 --> 09:21.927
But you hate babies.

09:21.929 --> 09:24.930
Well, I'm just shocked
you're prioritizing

09:24.932 --> 09:28.033
your ex's sip-and-see over
your son's college education,

09:28.035 --> 09:29.434
but hey, that's just me.

09:29.436 --> 09:31.570
PETER:
<i>Okay. Punchline and point made.</i>

09:31.572 --> 09:33.104
[laughs]

09:33.106 --> 09:35.206
Okay, fine.
You're in charge of picking up

09:35.208 --> 09:37.876
whatever someone brings
to a sip-and-see.

09:37.878 --> 09:39.945
Got it. Okay,
see you at home.

Yo!

10:30.964 --> 10:33.031
Mrs. Edgar.
Hi.

10:34.468 --> 10:36.601
I appreciate you coming
back down here.

10:36.603 --> 10:39.070
Well, you have to make time
for what's important.

10:39.072 --> 10:40.338
Ain't that
the truth.

10:40.340 --> 10:43.274
Kids are lucky to have you.
Thank you.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.144
Luce too.
Oh, we're lucky to have him.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.913
We care a great deal
about his success.

10:48.915 --> 10:51.616
Peter and I too.
Of course.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.419
And I know
context matters.

10:54.421 --> 10:55.553
Please, sit.

10:56.923 --> 10:59.357
Given Luce's
background,

10:59.359 --> 11:02.961
you and Peter must have faced
quite a few challenges.

11:02.963 --> 11:04.963
the language barrier,
the culture shock.

11:04.965 --> 11:06.264
He's a resilient kid.

11:06.266 --> 11:08.133
He is.
But it's also

11:08.135 --> 11:09.601
a testament to
your parenting.

11:09.603 --> 11:11.703
Well, thank you.

11:11.705 --> 11:13.004
We had a lot of support,

11:13.006 --> 11:15.440
especially in the
early days. I mean,

11:15.442 --> 11:17.308
you don't pull a kid
out of a war zone

11:17.310 --> 11:19.611
and have him turn out like
Luce without a lot of help.

11:19.613 --> 11:21.146
I bet.

11:21.148 --> 11:23.214
Which is why this
is so difficult.

11:24.151 --> 11:25.116
Difficult?

11:29.623 --> 11:32.691
Last week, the class
was given an assignment

11:32.693 --> 11:35.694
to write in the voice
of an historical figure.

11:35.696 --> 11:39.798
Some students picked FDR at the
start of the Great Depression

11:39.800 --> 11:41.066
or even Fidel Castro

11:41.068 --> 11:43.134
at the Bay of Pigs.

11:43.136 --> 11:46.638
The goal was to get them
to think outside of the box.

11:46.640 --> 11:49.307
Want to make sure you understand
where I'm coming from.

11:51.578 --> 11:52.777

12:21.508 --> 12:24.509
Who is this Frantz Fanon?

12:24.511 --> 12:27.579
He was a pan-African
revolutionary.

12:27.581 --> 12:31.583
He argued that violence was
a necessary cleansing force,

12:31.585 --> 12:33.384
that it was needed to
free colonized people

12:33.386 --> 12:34.586
from their rulers.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.955
You-you teach this?
I don't.

12:37.891 --> 12:39.190
Look,

12:39.192 --> 12:41.860
I won't pretend
to know what it's like

12:41.862 --> 12:44.763
for Luce to confront
certain aspects of who he is

12:44.765 --> 12:47.098
and it's not
within my purview

12:47.100 --> 12:50.535
to say what a boy who spent
his first 10 years in...

12:50.537 --> 12:51.503
Eritrea.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.705
Right.

12:53.707 --> 12:55.206
What that might
have been like,

12:55.208 --> 12:57.742
what kind of adjustments
he must have made

12:57.744 --> 12:58.943
in order to fit in here.

12:58.945 --> 13:00.812
And I don't know

13:00.814 --> 13:03.414
the details of his treatment--
I'm sure you've heard

13:03.416 --> 13:05.150
he went through
years of recovery

13:05.152 --> 13:07.886
and he showed no signs of--
I-I didn't mean to imply--

13:07.888 --> 13:09.888
I just want to be clear
that whatever

13:09.890 --> 13:13.224
violence he both suffered and
inflicted during that time

13:13.226 --> 13:15.827
was dealt with,
it's been processed.

13:15.829 --> 13:17.228
Of course.

13:17.230 --> 13:20.165
But with the climate
around school security

13:20.167 --> 13:23.101
the way it is right now,
you can understand my concern.

13:23.103 --> 13:24.435
Yes.

13:24.437 --> 13:25.737
Which is why I felt

13:25.739 --> 13:27.739
I needed to search
his locker.

13:27.741 --> 13:29.741
I'm sorry?
Amy...

13:29.743 --> 13:31.109
He wrote a paper.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.144
A paper in which
he describes

13:33.146 --> 13:35.647
his belief that the solution
to a political problem

13:35.649 --> 13:37.749
is to gun down those
with whom you disagree.

13:37.751 --> 13:39.584
Right. But he was
assuming a character.

13:39.586 --> 13:41.986
The assignment called
for this and you--

13:45.926 --> 13:47.692
I found this in his locker.

13:51.665 --> 13:52.797
No.
Amy.

13:52.799 --> 13:53.798
No, I'm sorry.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.100
I respect my son's privacy.

13:56.102 --> 13:58.269
Now, he wrote a paper
that scared you. Fine.

13:58.271 --> 13:59.470
That's between
you and him.

13:59.472 --> 14:01.206
But I won't,
I will not violate

14:01.208 --> 14:03.341
his right to the privacy
he's owed.

14:03.343 --> 14:05.276
They're fireworks.

14:05.278 --> 14:07.779
Illegal and very dangerous
fireworks.

14:07.781 --> 14:10.014
They could put a hole
in the wall, let alone--

14:10.016 --> 14:11.983
Where are you going with this?

14:11.985 --> 14:14.485
Right now I'm the only one
who knows about them,

14:14.487 --> 14:16.888
but what if someone else
were to find them?

14:16.890 --> 14:19.958
If someone who didn't know
Luce the way you and I do

14:19.960 --> 14:22.994
were to stumble on this within
the context of his background

14:22.996 --> 14:24.596
having written this...

14:25.498 --> 14:26.531
Take them.

14:27.300 --> 14:28.266
Talk to him.

14:30.337 --> 14:33.204
Who he is is too important
to this school

14:33.206 --> 14:34.672
for him to fuck it up.

14:34.674 --> 14:36.941
He can't fuck it up.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.078
Talk to him, please.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.718
I will.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.822
ORLICKI:
You're the one who keeps
talking about Stephanie.

14:50.824 --> 14:52.323
COREY: I'm not!
The fuck is wrong with you?

14:52.325 --> 14:54.225
Shut it!
Get off me!

14:54.227 --> 14:56.327
COREY:
You should have kept
your mouth shut, little shit.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.495
ORLICKI:
I told you!

14:57.497 --> 14:58.997
Yo, what the hell! Come on!

14:58.999 --> 15:00.765
He told everybody!
Fuck you!

15:00.767 --> 15:04.168
[indistinct shouting]

15:04.170 --> 15:05.904
If this gets out,
it's on your two.

15:05.906 --> 15:07.338
Both of you!
COACH: Yo!

15:09.109 --> 15:11.743
Everything okay?
Everything's fine, coach.

15:14.714 --> 15:16.881
Luce, my office.

15:16.883 --> 15:18.116
Sure thing.

15:25.292 --> 15:26.758
AMY:
You read the whole thing?

15:26.760 --> 15:28.126
Yeah.

15:28.128 --> 15:30.595
Okay, yeah, kids get
taken with ideas.

15:30.597 --> 15:31.930
Look, he probably stumbled

15:31.932 --> 15:33.865
across Frantz Fanon
on the internet

15:33.867 --> 15:35.466
and went overboard.

15:35.468 --> 15:37.902
I read the Communist Manifesto
when I was an undergrad

15:37.904 --> 15:40.038
and called people
comrade for a month.

15:40.040 --> 15:42.874
Yeah, well, I think he's
a little too smart for that.

15:42.876 --> 15:45.443
Not too smart to have
explosives in his locker.

15:45.445 --> 15:47.645
They're fireworks.
Illegal fireworks

15:47.647 --> 15:49.614
Still--
that have explosive capacity,

15:49.616 --> 15:51.749
I Googled this,
of a shotgun blast.

15:51.751 --> 15:52.750
They're fireworks.

15:52.752 --> 15:54.953
It's not shocking.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.688
That is shocking.

15:58.091 --> 16:00.258
Okay, so what?

16:00.260 --> 16:02.994
So what?
What? What, our...

16:04.331 --> 16:07.031
teenage soon-to-be
valedictorian son is,

16:07.968 --> 16:09.734
secretly a radical?
No.

16:09.736 --> 16:10.802
A terrorist?
No.

16:10.804 --> 16:12.303
No. Of course not.
What then?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.472
I don't know. It's just
something's going on

16:14.474 --> 16:16.074
and I want to be
in front of it.

16:16.076 --> 16:18.409
[keys jangling]
Oh shit.

16:18.411 --> 16:19.877

Amy, what the fuck?

16:21.514 --> 16:22.747
Hey!
Hey.

16:22.749 --> 16:23.982
How was school?

16:29.089 --> 16:30.221
What's going on?

16:31.157 --> 16:32.357
Nothing.

16:32.359 --> 16:34.325
How was school?
How was practice?

16:34.327 --> 16:35.560

16:36.663 --> 16:37.662
Psy.

16:39.366 --> 16:41.866
Have you eaten?
Not yet.

16:41.868 --> 16:44.669
Oh good, because
your dad picked up curry.

16:44.671 --> 16:45.670
Sweet!

16:46.840 --> 16:47.839
[coughs]

16:50.710 --> 16:52.877
[slight chuckles]

16:52.879 --> 16:55.713
Okay, put your stuff down
so we can eat.

16:55.715 --> 16:58.016
Cool.
Great.

16:58.018 --> 16:59.884
Don't start without me.
We won't.

17:01.287 --> 17:02.687
Hey...

17:02.689 --> 17:04.821
What was that?
I don't want him to know

17:04.824 --> 17:06.891
we've gone through his things.
We didn't.

17:06.893 --> 17:09.660
Or make it seem we went behind
his back to his teachers.

17:09.662 --> 17:11.128
Amy...
Come on, Pete.

17:11.131 --> 17:13.131
How many years did it take us
to get him here?

17:13.133 --> 17:15.465
How many nights did I crawl
underneath that bed

17:15.468 --> 17:17.502
because he was too scared
to sleep in it?

17:17.503 --> 17:19.137
What we've built.
That trust.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.439
I won't risk it.
I won't.

I got everything ready.

17:39.359 --> 17:41.759
Yes, I'll be by to talk
with the doctors tomorrow

17:41.761 --> 17:42.827
and we'll be all set.

17:44.197 --> 17:45.730
Rose...

17:45.732 --> 17:47.398
Rose, I told you already, okay?

17:49.269 --> 17:51.769
Okay. I'll see you soon.

17:52.505 --> 17:53.771
I love you too.

[sighs]

18:17.363 --> 18:18.930
Okay, so who told you?

18:18.932 --> 18:22.200
Told us what?
You clearly know.

18:22.202 --> 18:23.468
What do we know?

18:23.470 --> 18:25.870
LUCE:
You don't-- You don't know?

18:25.872 --> 18:29.707
What is it that you think
we do or do not know, honey?

18:30.276 --> 18:31.442
Um...

18:33.480 --> 18:35.279
Coach Reeves
offered me Captain.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.314
Wow!
Whoa.

18:36.316 --> 18:38.416
Oh my God!
That's amazing!

18:38.418 --> 18:39.784
Yeah! It's dope.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.285
Says I'll be
good example

18:41.287 --> 18:43.588
for certain teammates.
But between track

18:43.590 --> 18:46.257
and debate prep, plus the extra
shit Wilson has us doing...

18:46.259 --> 18:47.492
What, how do you mean?

18:47.494 --> 18:49.827
Nothing. It's just...

18:51.064 --> 18:52.697
You really don't like her,
do you?

18:53.566 --> 18:54.732
It's complicated.

18:55.802 --> 18:57.034
Try me.

18:58.571 --> 19:00.805
Okay. You remember
Stephanie Kim, right?

19:02.809 --> 19:04.509
Sort of...
Not a clue.

19:04.511 --> 19:06.344
She came over one time last...

19:06.346 --> 19:08.412
AMY: Go on.
Anyway.

19:08.414 --> 19:10.348
There were rumors
going around about her

19:10.350 --> 19:11.983
after this party
a few weeks ago.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.352
What kind of rumors?
Oh, people were drinking

19:14.354 --> 19:16.787
and no one really knows
what happened, but, um...

19:16.789 --> 19:18.356
Stephanie got
kind of messed up.

19:18.358 --> 19:19.857
Something happened
with some guys.

19:19.859 --> 19:21.659
Then Wilson got involved

19:21.661 --> 19:23.794
and no one really
could prove anything

19:23.796 --> 19:26.631
but she kept using Stephanie
as like an example.

19:26.633 --> 19:28.166
turning her
into a victim.

19:28.168 --> 19:30.001
How?
Well,

19:30.003 --> 19:33.204
we'll be talking about women
in Middle East or something

19:33.206 --> 19:35.706
and she singles her out,
says some shit like,

19:35.708 --> 19:38.309
"We all know firsthand
how important it is for women

19:38.311 --> 19:40.978
to have the courage
to stand up, to fight."

19:40.980 --> 19:42.547
AMY: I don't understand.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.348
It's not exactly
singling her out.

19:44.350 --> 19:45.850
It's how she says it.

19:45.852 --> 19:47.451
Like everyone's
a symbol to her.

19:47.453 --> 19:49.720
Stephanie, Deshaun,
we all exist

19:49.722 --> 19:52.190
to confirm the world
is the way she sees it.

19:52.192 --> 19:53.991
AMY:
So does she do that
kind of thing with you?

19:53.993 --> 19:55.826
[scoffs]
Are you kidding?

19:55.828 --> 19:57.228
I'm a fucking
poster boy.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.730
Black kid who overcame
his tragic past,

19:59.732 --> 20:01.933
the example why America
works. It's bullshit.

20:03.169 --> 20:05.203
So you don't like her
labeling you?

20:05.205 --> 20:07.305
I don't like tokenism.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.640
What's the difference
between punishing someone

20:09.642 --> 20:12.577
for being a stereotype and
rewarding them if they're not?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.645
One of the two
comes with benefits.

20:14.647 --> 20:16.147
What you'd call a benefit,

20:16.149 --> 20:17.748
I'd call a responsibility
I didn't ask for.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.451
Okay, what about responsibility
to tell the truth?

20:21.521 --> 20:22.520
What?
Peter...

20:22.522 --> 20:23.754
So, one of the

20:23.756 --> 20:25.756
benefits you get
is benefit of the doubt.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.992
A chance to explain yourself.
Explain myself?

20:27.994 --> 20:29.327
AMY: Enough.
Whereas another student

20:29.329 --> 20:30.828
might not. So...

20:32.599 --> 20:34.498
You have anything
you want to tell us?

20:34.500 --> 20:36.300
AMY: Peter, stop.
About what?

20:40.373 --> 20:41.572
Ask your mom.

20:46.446 --> 20:47.845

23:32.378 --> 23:34.412
take it easy on me today.
How are you all doing?

23:34.414 --> 23:36.347
Ms. Wilson, so glad
you could join us.

23:36.349 --> 23:39.083
Luce was hoping to get some
help building his next case.

23:39.085 --> 23:41.519
I figure you and Principal Dan
are the all stars.

23:41.521 --> 23:43.888
We're going to nationals
again this year, right?

23:43.890 --> 23:45.856

Boom!

23:45.858 --> 23:47.892
That's why this one's
my thoroughbred.

23:47.894 --> 23:49.260
Okay, let's have it.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.095
Ms. Wilson...

23:51.097 --> 23:54.265
Of course. Let's, uh,
let's hear what you got.

23:59.539 --> 24:01.705
What are you doing?
Jesus, Pete!

24:03.209 --> 24:05.109
Doesn't it make sense
just to get rid of them?

24:05.111 --> 24:06.277
They're so dangerous.

24:06.279 --> 24:07.545
We hang on to them

24:07.547 --> 24:09.280
until we get to
the bottom of this.

24:11.884 --> 24:13.217
They'll be
safe here.

24:15.121 --> 24:16.120
What?

24:16.923 --> 24:17.888
What?

24:25.731 --> 24:26.831
LUCE:
My argument

24:26.833 --> 24:29.099
is premised on
two court cases:

24:29.101 --> 24:31.469
Goss v. Lopez,
1975,

24:31.471 --> 24:34.672
and New Jersey
v. T.L.O., 1985.

24:34.674 --> 24:37.842
In Goss, an Ohio school
suspended nine students

24:37.844 --> 24:39.143
for delinquent behavior,

24:39.145 --> 24:40.845
but the Supreme Court found

24:40.847 --> 24:43.414
that depriving students of
their right to an education

24:43.416 --> 24:44.582
without
due process

24:44.584 --> 24:46.784
is a violation
of their civil rights.

24:46.786 --> 24:48.486
Ms. Wilson,
do you agree with that?

24:48.488 --> 24:50.287
I'm sorry?

24:50.289 --> 24:51.956
LUCE:
Do you agree that those kids

24:51.958 --> 24:54.525
were deprived of
their civil rights?

24:54.527 --> 24:57.695
I don't know the specifics
of the case but

24:57.697 --> 25:00.264
the principal--
Principal makes sense, right?

25:00.266 --> 25:01.632
Education is a civil right.

25:01.634 --> 25:03.033
Everyone should have
civil rights.

25:03.035 --> 25:05.135
Right.
In the second case

25:05.137 --> 25:08.806
a student is accused of smoking
in the school bathroom,

25:08.808 --> 25:10.374
but there's no proof.

25:10.376 --> 25:12.877
The charge is premised
on a teacher's suspicion.

25:12.879 --> 25:16.113
So the principal searched
her purse and found cigarettes

25:16.115 --> 25:18.115
and marijuana-related
paraphernalia.

25:18.117 --> 25:19.450
Do you agree with that?

25:19.452 --> 25:21.218
What did the court say?

25:21.220 --> 25:22.720
The court found that students

25:22.722 --> 25:25.689
have a reduced expectation
of privacy in schools.

25:26.359 --> 25:27.358
It makes sense.

25:27.360 --> 25:28.792
Does it?

25:28.794 --> 25:33.564
A school is a unique
social institution.

25:33.566 --> 25:35.666
It's populated by people
who aren't adults

25:35.668 --> 25:38.402
in the eyes of the law.
People who have to be here.

25:38.404 --> 25:40.538
Students.
Yes.

25:40.540 --> 25:41.805
Students are half people.

25:41.807 --> 25:43.173
LENA:
Luce,

25:43.175 --> 25:45.142
is there a specific
question you have

25:45.144 --> 25:47.344
that Ms. Wilson
might be able to address?

25:47.346 --> 25:48.345
Totally.

25:48.347 --> 25:50.481
Thanks Ms. Tennyson.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.383
Um, basically my question

25:52.385 --> 25:54.518
that I hope Ms. Wilson
can help me with

25:54.520 --> 25:57.555
is around this idea
of reduced expectation

25:57.557 --> 26:00.758
versus the affirmation by the
court of student civil rights.

26:00.760 --> 26:02.760
Like what are the criteria
for evaluating

26:02.762 --> 26:04.528
what's a violation
of privacy?

26:04.530 --> 26:06.263
Is privacy a civil right?

26:06.265 --> 26:07.598
LUCE:
I think so.

26:07.600 --> 26:09.466
Maybe the law isn't so sure.

26:11.938 --> 26:14.338
If I went through your desk
without you knowing,

26:14.340 --> 26:16.307
would you feel like
your privacy was violated?

26:18.578 --> 26:20.377
Yes, I would.

26:20.379 --> 26:22.279
So?

26:22.281 --> 26:24.515
Feelings aren't
a legal argument.

26:24.517 --> 26:27.451
In the New Jersey case,
the teacher assumed

26:27.453 --> 26:29.720
the girl was guilty
because of her feelings.

26:29.722 --> 26:32.690
That's called
reasonable suspicion.

26:32.692 --> 26:35.593
It's all the police need
to search your car.

26:35.595 --> 26:38.128
LUCE:
So it's about what's reasonable.

26:38.130 --> 26:40.631
That's what courts are for.

26:42.234 --> 26:45.069
Really it's just about
people though, right?

26:45.071 --> 26:47.371
Whether they conform
to what we think they are.

26:49.041 --> 26:50.207
It's not that simple.

26:51.277 --> 26:52.610
Nothing ever is.

26:55.982 --> 26:57.648
[school bell rings]

26:57.650 --> 26:59.817
Thank you so much
for your help, Ms. Wilson.

26:59.819 --> 27:01.418
This was,
this was great, right?

27:01.420 --> 27:03.587
Any time.

27:03.589 --> 27:05.823
God, that kid is
something else, isn't he?

27:07.326 --> 27:11.729
[indistinct conversations]

27:16.135 --> 27:17.401
[school bell rings]

27:17.403 --> 27:19.036
All right, people,
phones away.

27:20.673 --> 27:21.939
I see you, Sasha.

27:21.941 --> 27:23.841
And you too,
Stephanie Kim.

27:25.578 --> 27:27.578
All right.
CHEERLEADERS: It's show time!

27:27.580 --> 27:29.079
You fucked up.
And bro,

27:29.081 --> 27:31.115
you can't just go slamming
Orlicki against a locker.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.516
He's out there
telling everybody.

27:32.518 --> 27:35.119
It's nothing half the school
didn't already know.

27:35.121 --> 27:37.121
Besides, I talked
to Stephanie.

27:37.123 --> 27:38.956
You two still talk?

27:38.958 --> 27:40.658
Not really, but someone
had to resolve this

27:40.660 --> 27:42.926
before it blows up.
Is she gonna be cool?

27:42.928 --> 27:44.261
Yeah.
Is she gonna be cool?

27:44.263 --> 27:45.929
Everything's going
to be cool, man.

27:45.931 --> 27:48.766
Just squash the beef
with Orlicki, all right?

27:48.768 --> 27:51.335
Corey!
All right, man. Whatever.

27:54.473 --> 27:57.441
Yo! Deshaun's
one bold-ass nigga.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.710
COREY:
Since Wilson got him
tossed off the team,

27:59.712 --> 28:00.944
he's been messed up.

28:05.651 --> 28:08.118
I'll catch you later, man.

28:08.120 --> 28:09.420
Yo.
Yeah.

28:11.724 --> 28:14.358
[phone chimes]

28:19.498 --> 28:21.165
MS. WILSON:
We agreed on this.

28:21.167 --> 28:24.301
If you live with me,
you have to be responsible for--

28:24.303 --> 28:27.304
All I ask is if you're staying
on top of your medication.

28:28.641 --> 28:30.507
I know what the doctor
said, Rosemary.

28:30.509 --> 28:32.910
It doesn't mean
I'm comfortable with it.

28:32.912 --> 28:35.045
MS. WILSON:
Out of everyone in this family,

28:35.047 --> 28:36.513
I've been there for you
time and time again.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.514
I resent that.

28:37.516 --> 28:39.083
[knocks on door]
Hey.

28:39.085 --> 28:41.752
I gotta go, Rose.
We'll talk tonight.

28:44.356 --> 28:46.890
Everything okay?
Everything's fine.

28:46.892 --> 28:48.826
Family stuff?

28:48.828 --> 28:50.327
Personal business, yes.

28:50.329 --> 28:51.295
Gotcha.

28:52.698 --> 28:54.765
Um, thanks for your
guidance this morning.

28:54.767 --> 28:56.667
It really helped
make my case.

28:56.669 --> 28:58.569
I'm glad.

28:58.571 --> 29:00.237
You wanted to see me?

29:00.239 --> 29:02.873
I wanted to talk to you about
your assignment, Luce.

29:02.875 --> 29:04.374
What about it?

29:04.376 --> 29:06.510
I assumed you spoke
to your mother...

29:06.512 --> 29:09.680
I haven't gotten it back yet.
How could I talk my mom of it?

29:11.383 --> 29:14.084
Well, I'll just say, uh...

29:14.086 --> 29:15.953
After reading it,
I have some concerns

29:15.955 --> 29:17.688
for some of
the arguments you made.

29:17.690 --> 29:19.356
Well they aren't mine.

29:19.358 --> 29:20.591
Excuse me?

29:20.593 --> 29:22.459
The arguments,
they're Frantz Fanon's.

29:22.461 --> 29:24.228
I realize that.

29:24.230 --> 29:25.929
The assignment was
to write in his voice.

29:25.931 --> 29:27.798
You really think
I believe that stuff?

29:27.800 --> 29:30.434
Well, I don't know.

29:30.436 --> 29:33.437
If I didn't know you, Luce,
it would be reasonable for me

29:33.439 --> 29:35.305
to read that assignment
and conclude--

29:35.307 --> 29:36.440
But you do know me.

29:39.278 --> 29:41.245
Look, um,

29:41.247 --> 29:43.247
I'm sorry if I scared you.

29:43.249 --> 29:45.549
I just wanted to do
a good job.

29:45.551 --> 29:47.651
You did do a good job.

29:47.653 --> 29:49.219
I mean, I get it.

29:49.221 --> 29:50.988
Get what?
Well, I get

29:50.990 --> 29:53.991
how someone who learned how to
shoot a gun before driving a car

29:53.993 --> 29:55.392
writing something like that

29:55.394 --> 29:57.161
might make someone
freaked out.

29:58.798 --> 30:01.398
I just hope you know me
better than that, Ms. Wilson.

30:03.002 --> 30:05.469
I like to think
that I do, Luce.

30:07.640 --> 30:09.840
Anything else you wanted
to talk to me about?

30:10.409 --> 30:11.809
No.

30:11.811 --> 30:13.510
Tell your mom
I'd like her to call me.

30:14.013 --> 30:15.012
Why?

30:16.515 --> 30:18.182
Because I want
to speak with her.

30:19.018 --> 30:20.951
What about? I mean,

30:20.953 --> 30:24.087
I guess it's about me unless you
guys are friends or something.

30:24.089 --> 30:25.622
Please have her
call me, Luce.

30:25.624 --> 30:27.157
Thank you for
stopping in.

30:27.159 --> 30:28.325
Of course.

30:33.632 --> 30:34.898
Hey, Ms. Wilson...

30:36.035 --> 30:37.634
What's your favorite holiday?

30:37.636 --> 30:41.171
Excuse me?
What's your favorite holiday?

30:41.173 --> 30:43.473
I don't know.
Christmas maybe.

30:43.475 --> 30:44.875
Mine is Independence Day.

30:44.877 --> 30:46.677
[¶¶¶]

30:46.679 --> 30:48.445
Before I came here,

30:48.447 --> 30:50.848
I didn't know
a single holiday and

30:50.850 --> 30:54.618
I remember my mom trying
to explain what they were.

30:54.620 --> 30:57.120
It's a hard concept to grasp
if you've never of it,

30:57.122 --> 30:58.722
but,

30:58.724 --> 31:01.158
once I learned them all,
my favorite, hands down,

31:01.160 --> 31:03.861
has always been
Independence Day.

31:03.863 --> 31:04.862
Why is that?

31:04.864 --> 31:06.730
I like what it represents.

31:08.234 --> 31:10.167
Freedom,

31:10.169 --> 31:11.201
strength,

31:12.671 --> 31:13.871
individuality.

31:15.541 --> 31:19.042
Also I love the fireworks.
The lights.

31:19.044 --> 31:20.244
Poof!

31:22.014 --> 31:25.148
Luce, I'd like to remind you
that you're still a student here

31:25.150 --> 31:27.317
and I am your teacher.

31:27.319 --> 31:31.521
And regardless of what you may
view as some sort of injustice

31:31.523 --> 31:33.523
What are you talking about?
...or unfair,

31:33.525 --> 31:36.260
just remember how things
are organized around here.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.130
Totally.
I'll see you around.

31:51.377 --> 31:54.211
The financials from Cusack.
Thanks, Beth.

31:54.213 --> 31:56.046
Quarter end payments
went out, right?

31:56.048 --> 31:59.950
Yes.
[cell phone vibrating]

32:02.855 --> 32:03.854
Yeah?

32:06.225 --> 32:08.825
Ms. Wilson.
How are you?

32:13.866 --> 32:15.632
Why is she calling you?

32:15.634 --> 32:18.201
Well, last I checked
I'm one of two parents.

32:18.203 --> 32:20.203
Yeah, but she was
communicating with me

32:20.205 --> 32:21.705
and now she's calling you?

32:21.707 --> 32:24.374
Well, we're both available
to talk about our son.

32:24.376 --> 32:28.045
This woman has some kind
of vendetta against Luce.

32:28.047 --> 32:29.479
Vendetta? Really?
Yeah.

32:29.481 --> 32:31.882
She has some <i> thing </i>
with him and now,

32:31.884 --> 32:33.917
now she's trying to
divide and conquer.

32:33.919 --> 32:35.385
Nice word choice.

32:35.387 --> 32:36.920
What she did
with Stephanie Kim

32:36.922 --> 32:38.989
and what she's trying
to do now with Luce,

32:38.991 --> 32:41.825
this woman holds different kids
to different standards based--

32:41.827 --> 32:44.328
Did you see or hear what
she did to that girl?

32:44.330 --> 32:47.130
I've heard enough to know.
From Luce, yeah.

32:47.132 --> 32:51.001
Yes, from our son, who has
always been honest with us.

32:51.003 --> 32:53.603
Except about having illegal
fireworks in his locker.

32:53.605 --> 32:55.305
He didn't lie about that.

32:55.307 --> 32:57.507
Is that so?
Not telling us

32:57.509 --> 32:59.676
and lying are two
different things.

32:59.678 --> 33:01.945
And what if there's
a pattern here?

33:01.947 --> 33:03.413
A pattern?
Yeah.

33:03.415 --> 33:05.282
The paper, the fireworks,
the threat--

33:05.284 --> 33:07.617
Peter...

33:07.619 --> 33:09.853
We have to be at least open to
Absolutely not.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.089
the possibility that
our son is capable of...

33:12.091 --> 33:14.992
Of what? Capable of what?

33:14.994 --> 33:16.927
Tell me you know
he's a good kid, Pete.

33:16.929 --> 33:18.628
Tell me if shit
hits the fan,

33:18.630 --> 33:20.330
we aren't about
to abandon our son.

33:20.332 --> 33:22.332
We're not going to abandon him.
Our black son to a system

33:22.334 --> 33:24.668
that already wants
to shit all over him.

33:26.605 --> 33:29.673
It's our job to protect him,
to have his back.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.274
That's part of it.
It's our job

33:31.276 --> 33:32.943
to do what's right.
By him.

33:32.945 --> 33:34.644
To do what's
right by him.

33:34.646 --> 33:36.146
[keys jangling]

33:36.148 --> 33:37.547
Luce!
Yeah?

33:37.549 --> 33:39.349
Got a minute?
You said you'd do this my way.

33:39.351 --> 33:41.184
PETER: Yeah.
What's up?

33:41.186 --> 33:42.652
Did you threaten
your teacher?

33:42.654 --> 33:43.687
Honey...
Excuse me?

33:43.689 --> 33:44.688
You heard me.

33:44.690 --> 33:45.689
Did I threaten...?

33:45.691 --> 33:47.958
Ms. Wilson called.

33:47.960 --> 33:49.559
Ms. Wilson said
I threatened her?

33:49.561 --> 33:50.794
Did you?

33:50.796 --> 33:52.162
What did she say?
She said--

33:52.164 --> 33:54.131
Never mind what she said.
What did you do?

33:54.133 --> 33:55.732
She asked me
to come and see her.

33:55.734 --> 33:57.300
And?

33:57.302 --> 33:59.669
I thanked her for helping
me with my debate case.

33:59.671 --> 34:01.838
She helped you?
Yeah, her and Principal Dan.

34:01.840 --> 34:03.907
Why would I
threaten her?

34:03.909 --> 34:05.909
What did she want
to talk to you about?

34:05.911 --> 34:08.011
A paper.
We had a misunderstanding.

34:08.013 --> 34:09.980
I apologized for it.

34:09.982 --> 34:11.882
You say anything about
the 4th of July?

34:11.884 --> 34:13.183
What?
Honey...

34:13.185 --> 34:15.185
About fireworks?
How is that a threat?

34:15.187 --> 34:17.654
Did you or did you not say
something about the 4th of July?

34:17.656 --> 34:19.688
I said the 4th of July
was my favorite holiday.

34:19.690 --> 34:21.058
Why would you say that?

34:21.060 --> 34:22.726
I thought we were
having a conversation.

34:22.728 --> 34:24.327
She says I threatened her?

34:24.329 --> 34:26.163
I need you to be straight
with me for a second.

34:26.165 --> 34:27.731
When am I not?
Hey!

34:31.335 --> 34:32.302
Sure.

34:34.572 --> 34:37.674
So is there anything
you want to tell us?

34:38.710 --> 34:40.043
No.
You sure about that?

34:40.045 --> 34:41.844
Am I sure about what?
Jesus, if you guys

34:41.847 --> 34:43.513
want to ask me--
Why did you have

34:43.514 --> 34:45.549
illegal fireworks
in your locker?

34:45.551 --> 34:46.917
LUCE: What?
Why did you have

34:46.918 --> 34:48.784
illegal fireworks
in your locker?

34:48.786 --> 34:51.054
I didn't.
Luce, don't lie to me.

34:51.056 --> 34:52.456
I'm not.
Luce!

34:52.458 --> 34:54.056
How would you know
what's in my locker?

34:54.059 --> 34:56.726
Harriet told us.
Harriet has a lot to say.

34:56.728 --> 34:59.096
Never mind what she said.
Did you or didn't you?

34:59.098 --> 35:01.698
Not that I know of.
Oh, you know what?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.367
Fuck this.
We share lockers.

35:04.369 --> 35:06.369
The guys on the team
share lockers.

35:06.371 --> 35:09.106
Half my shit is in Orlicki's,
half his shit is in mine.

35:09.108 --> 35:11.108
I don't know what 90%
of the crap at the bottom is,

35:11.110 --> 35:13.110
let alone who it belongs to.
So...

35:13.112 --> 35:15.278
So not everything in
my locker belongs to me.

35:16.448 --> 35:17.614
Okay, good.

35:19.051 --> 35:20.050
That's good.

35:20.052 --> 35:21.418
Now, you understand

35:21.420 --> 35:23.120
why it's important
to know

35:23.122 --> 35:25.789
not only what's in your locker,
but who it belongs to.

35:25.791 --> 35:27.224
Yes.
Right?

35:27.226 --> 35:28.558
You can't blindly
trust people to...

35:28.560 --> 35:31.795
Okay. You seriously
buy this shit?

35:34.399 --> 35:35.532
Seriously?

35:37.803 --> 35:40.937
So someone just happens to leave
a bag of illegal fireworks

35:40.939 --> 35:43.340
in your locker
and you have no idea?

35:43.342 --> 35:47.310
And then this teacher,
who you don't like,

35:47.312 --> 35:50.780
unjustifiably searches
your locker and finds them.

35:50.782 --> 35:52.349
You're just an
unlucky victim

35:52.351 --> 35:54.618
of circumstance, right?
It's the truth.

35:54.620 --> 35:56.586
That doesn't sound
like the truth to me.

35:56.588 --> 35:58.221
That sounds like bullshit.

36:05.664 --> 36:06.763
You believe me?

36:13.272 --> 36:14.704
We can figure this out.

36:18.110 --> 36:19.376
[sighs]

36:27.119 --> 36:30.554
[heavy beat]

36:56.381 --> 36:59.883

37:39.424 --> 37:44.127
[hip hop beat]

38:18.997 --> 38:22.132
ORLICKI:
I didn't tell anyone
about Stephanie or the party.

38:22.134 --> 38:24.567
Corey should calm
the fuck down.

38:24.569 --> 38:26.336
I talked to him,
everything's fine.

38:26.338 --> 38:28.772
Yeah, tell that to the bruise
on my fucking neck.

38:28.774 --> 38:30.940
You gotta understand
where he's coming from.

38:30.942 --> 38:32.642
Your dad went
to Dartmouth.

38:32.644 --> 38:34.244
Your granddad
went to Dartmouth.

38:34.246 --> 38:36.446
Your dog could probably
get into Dartmouth.

38:36.448 --> 38:38.315
[laughter]

38:38.317 --> 38:40.283
Corey
doesn't have that.

38:40.285 --> 38:43.186
A whiff of something up with him
and he's the next Deshaun.

38:45.123 --> 38:47.824
Can't be walking around
at night smelling high, bro.

38:47.826 --> 38:50.527
You seriously think
someone's gonna stop you?

38:50.529 --> 38:53.797
I'm not interested in being
the next Deshaun either.

38:53.799 --> 38:55.665
You're not like Deshaun.

38:55.667 --> 38:57.500
We're both black,
Orlicki.

38:57.502 --> 39:01.404
Yeah, but he's
like black-black.

39:03.175 --> 39:04.841
Then what am I?

39:04.843 --> 39:06.176
You're Luce.

39:06.178 --> 39:09.546
[laid-back

39:18.123 --> 39:21.157
[out-of-tune strum]

39:21.159 --> 39:23.360
[both chuckle]

39:33.805 --> 39:36.005
What are you doing?

39:36.007 --> 39:37.640
Where were you?

39:37.642 --> 39:40.577
I went for a run.
What do you want?

39:40.579 --> 39:42.512
I just wanted
to apologize

39:42.514 --> 39:44.147
for before.

39:44.149 --> 39:45.749
Your father...
...thinks I'm a liar?

39:45.751 --> 39:50.019
No, he-he's confused.
We both are.

39:50.021 --> 39:50.987
Confused about what?

39:52.724 --> 39:54.858
I told you the kind
of person Wilson is.

39:54.860 --> 39:56.559
You don't conform
to what she wants

39:56.561 --> 39:57.994
and suddenly
you're the enemy.

39:58.663 --> 40:00.697
Look...

40:00.699 --> 40:03.533
I know it can seem unfair
how much people expect of you.

40:03.535 --> 40:04.567
You don't, though.

40:05.570 --> 40:06.870
You can't.

40:06.872 --> 40:08.772
And sometimes
I'm working so hard

40:08.774 --> 40:10.106
to keep this
all together,

40:10.108 --> 40:11.841
it feels like it'll all just--
What?

40:11.843 --> 40:14.210
Just what?
I can't be perfect.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.779
No one expects you
to be perfect.

40:15.781 --> 40:17.514
Wilson does.

40:17.516 --> 40:20.383
Believe it or not, she's
just trying to protect you.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.386
She's trying to protect
her idea of me.

40:23.388 --> 40:25.355
Same as you and him.

40:26.124 --> 40:27.524
That's not fair.

40:27.526 --> 40:29.859
Unfair doesn't make it
untrue.

[cell phone chimes]

40:38.270 --> 40:39.269
Luce...

40:40.806 --> 40:43.573
I have to get up early
for practice in the morning.

40:43.575 --> 40:44.607
Good night, Amy.

41:53.178 --> 41:55.545
<i> I fucking hate it.</i>

41:55.547 --> 42:01.184

<i> a woman suffering in silence.</i>

42:01.186 --> 42:04.454
<i> So everyone</i>
<i> is gossiping again.</i>

42:04.456 --> 42:07.223

<i> for us to take a break.</i>

42:07.225 --> 42:10.860

42:10.862 --> 42:11.895

You look different.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.685
New weave.

42:35.687 --> 42:36.953
What kind?

42:37.923 --> 42:41.291
Indian.
Oh!

42:44.362 --> 42:45.628
Thank you.
Here you go.

42:50.001 --> 42:52.201
MS. WILSON:
What do they have you
taking now?

42:52.203 --> 42:53.870
Clozapine.

42:53.872 --> 42:56.005
Makes me sweat like the devil.

42:57.409 --> 42:58.408
Harriet,

42:59.911 --> 43:01.411
what is this?

43:01.413 --> 43:02.579
That's Greek yogurt.

43:03.949 --> 43:05.381
Just taste it.

43:05.383 --> 43:06.516
All right.

43:09.554 --> 43:10.720
Oh, it's good-No!

43:10.722 --> 43:12.589
[laughter]

43:13.858 --> 43:15.291
You looked so--

43:17.696 --> 43:21.464
[muzak playing]

43:26.237 --> 43:29.272
Ah! Now this
what I call breakfast.

43:31.076 --> 43:34.043
Shut your mouth. Since when
you ever turn down some bacon?

43:34.045 --> 43:36.946
[laughter]

43:54.299 --> 43:57.400
I know we ate this
our whole lives but,

43:57.402 --> 43:59.802
this instant shit's
made of poison.

43:59.804 --> 44:02.271
I don't know how
we made it through.

44:02.273 --> 44:03.640
[Rose laughing]
Rose?

44:06.111 --> 44:09.846
[both laughing]

44:13.685 --> 44:14.851
Ms. Wilson?

44:16.421 --> 44:19.756
You know Harriet?
Ms. Wilson's my teacher.

44:19.758 --> 44:22.358
Oh! Ain't the world

44:22.360 --> 44:25.194
tiny and great!
I just came here

44:25.196 --> 44:26.596
to pick up snacks
for the fundraiser.

44:26.598 --> 44:27.964
This young man
was just telling me

44:27.966 --> 44:29.499
about something
called paleo.

44:29.501 --> 44:31.668
It's a diet,
how the cavemen ate.

44:31.670 --> 44:33.870
Cavemen didn't
live long, Luce.

44:33.872 --> 44:35.438
Well, I bet
they went out

44:35.440 --> 44:38.341
with great abs.
[both laugh]

44:38.343 --> 44:39.542
Ain't he the cutest?

44:39.544 --> 44:41.377
[Rosemary laughs]
Ms. Wilson,

44:41.379 --> 44:44.881
Rosemary should come to our
Culture Month Gala at school.

44:44.883 --> 44:46.149
I'm giving a speech.

44:46.151 --> 44:48.317
Oh! Is that right?
Yeah.

44:48.319 --> 44:49.986
I don't normally get
to go places,

44:49.988 --> 44:51.554
so that would be
a treat for me.

44:51.556 --> 44:52.955
She should come.
Right, Ms. Wilson?

44:54.959 --> 44:56.192
We'll talk about it.

44:58.663 --> 45:00.630
Cool.

45:00.632 --> 45:02.198
It was nice meeting you,
Rosemary.

45:02.200 --> 45:03.833
ROSE: Mm-hm!

45:03.835 --> 45:05.702
And, um, I hope
you can make it.

45:05.704 --> 45:06.869
Me too!

45:08.373 --> 45:09.972
Bye.
Bye.

of black name is Luce?

Hey, Pete.

45:22.587 --> 45:24.587
Pete, you want
to give him a whirl?

Hey! Who is that?
Who is that?

45:30.261 --> 45:34.030
[Pete makes cooing sounds]

45:34.032 --> 45:37.266
Thank you. I'm really glad
you guys could make it.

[Pete makes cooing sounds]

45:48.079 --> 45:49.912
[baby giggles]

45:52.951 --> 45:56.285
How you doing?
[baby coos]

45:56.287 --> 45:58.821
[baby laughs]

46:03.361 --> 46:05.361
How many times
do I have to tell you no?

46:05.363 --> 46:07.096
You have to start talking
to a little kid.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.098
It's a fucking car wash.
What are you arguing about?

46:09.100 --> 46:10.633
What the hell's
he doing here?

46:10.635 --> 46:13.035
COACH:
Come on, man, look.
No team events.

46:13.037 --> 46:14.537
It's a...
This has been explained to you.

46:14.539 --> 46:16.873
Bro, I'm not arguing
with you over no car wash.

46:16.875 --> 46:18.875
What's your problem?
It's a fundraiser for the team.

46:18.877 --> 46:21.310
Coach Reeves, it's my fault.
I invited Deshaun.

46:21.312 --> 46:23.279
I didn't realize
it violated

46:23.281 --> 46:24.881
the terms of his agreement
with the school.

46:24.883 --> 46:26.883
Do you mind if we talk about
an assignment real quick

46:26.885 --> 46:27.884
before he goes?

46:29.754 --> 46:31.454
As long
as it's quick.

46:31.456 --> 46:34.257
Cool. Thanks, Coach.
Come on, bro.

46:34.259 --> 46:37.226
Sorry about that.
No, fuck his bitch ass, man.

46:37.228 --> 46:40.830
That nigga always undermining
with me, bro, from day one.

46:40.832 --> 46:42.732
Well we're getting killed
on these distance events

46:42.734 --> 46:45.768
without you, bro.
Corey can't run for shit

46:45.770 --> 46:48.271
unless there's pussy
waiting at the finish line.

46:48.273 --> 46:51.140
[both chuckle]

46:51.142 --> 46:53.509
Don't know. If it's anything
like his sister's pussy,

46:53.511 --> 46:56.078
that shit got stains on it.
[laughs]

46:56.080 --> 46:58.815
So I've heard.

46:58.817 --> 47:00.950
What's going on with you
and Mike Jeffs?

47:00.952 --> 47:02.985
I've been seeing you hanging
with him and his boys.

47:02.987 --> 47:05.221
I didn't know you all
were tight like that.

47:07.826 --> 47:11.928
I don't know. It ain't like
future Nobel Laureates and shit.

47:11.930 --> 47:13.863
You don't have to be
a Nobel Laureate

47:13.865 --> 47:16.599
to know that Mike Jeffs
is bad news, bro.

47:16.601 --> 47:18.601
Why you getting mixed up
with those guys?

47:18.603 --> 47:21.304
What the fuck? Chill out,
all right? I'm good.

47:21.306 --> 47:23.372
Damn, my pants
too low, too?

47:23.374 --> 47:25.641
I gotta hike them up if I want
to make something of myself?

47:25.643 --> 47:28.144
Na, my nigga, don't come over
here and try to patronize me.

47:28.146 --> 47:29.512
Come on, man.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.214
I don't know if you've
been busy distracted

47:31.216 --> 47:33.716
with Wilson and the rest of
these fake-ass motherfuckers

47:33.718 --> 47:36.519
sucking your dick 24/7
but my shit is done, bro.

47:36.521 --> 47:37.887
It's finished.

47:39.557 --> 47:42.191
As a matter of fact, how many
time we smoke together, Luce?

47:43.728 --> 47:45.928
How many times you come
to my crib and blaze?

47:47.699 --> 47:50.900
Yo, Wilson finds weed in my
locker and now I'm off the team.

47:50.902 --> 47:52.935
That's my scholarship gone.

47:55.206 --> 47:56.772
Why me and not you, my nigga?

47:58.910 --> 48:00.877
Answer the question.
Why me and not you?

48:00.879 --> 48:02.678
I don't know.
You don't know.

48:02.680 --> 48:04.313
You know what the fuck
I'm talking about.

48:04.315 --> 48:06.082
It's because
they want you to win.

48:06.084 --> 48:10.152
Otherwise, all their little up
by your own bootstraps bullshit,

48:10.154 --> 48:11.120
it don't apply.

48:12.891 --> 48:14.957
But then again,
why am I trippin'?

48:16.761 --> 48:18.761
Gotta have at least
one Obama, right?

48:18.763 --> 48:20.496
I didn't ask
for this, man.

48:20.498 --> 48:22.098
Oh, you didn't
ask for this.

48:22.100 --> 48:25.234
Word. So, what, you want
to trade or something?

48:29.774 --> 48:30.773
Yeah.

48:30.775 --> 48:32.508
Yeah, I didn't think so.

48:33.711 --> 48:34.810
Deshaun...

48:37.282 --> 48:38.648
I want to make this right.

48:47.125 --> 48:48.524
[glass shattering]

48:50.028 --> 48:51.594
Ro?

48:53.298 --> 48:54.664
Ro?

49:00.538 --> 49:01.837
Ro?

49:03.541 --> 49:05.174
Oh, God.

49:14.719 --> 49:18.120
[crunching underfoot]

49:33.438 --> 49:35.271
Hey.

49:35.273 --> 49:37.273
No, no...
Shhh.

49:37.275 --> 49:39.241
I was--

49:39.243 --> 49:43.746
I was walking and I was trying
to make it there and then...

49:43.748 --> 49:46.849
the food, the food was...

49:46.851 --> 49:48.284
Shhh!

49:48.286 --> 49:51.187
I'll clean it. I'll clean up.
You're okay.

49:51.189 --> 49:54.457
I'll clean it up.
Shhh.

49:54.459 --> 49:57.593
Breathe. Breathe.

49:57.595 --> 49:59.462
[Ms. Wilson exhales]

49:59.464 --> 50:00.930
[TV on in background]

50:00.932 --> 50:04.433
[door opens and closes]

50:04.435 --> 50:06.002
Hey! Sorry I'm late.

50:06.004 --> 50:08.838
No. Please, sit.

50:10.375 --> 50:12.875
They screwed up the order.
I asked for cappuccinos

50:12.877 --> 50:14.510
and they gave us
Frappuccinos.

50:14.512 --> 50:16.379
I like these more.
Oh, you do?

50:16.381 --> 50:19.215
Can't make it to the dinner
without at least three of them.

50:19.217 --> 50:22.351
Okay.
[both laugh awkwardly]

50:22.353 --> 50:25.855
Thank you.
No, thank you for, um,

50:25.857 --> 50:28.457
meeting me.
This must be a little weird.

50:28.459 --> 50:30.459
It is.

50:30.461 --> 50:33.195
Okay. Um, yeah, well
I guess I was hoping

50:33.197 --> 50:36.532
you could help me with
something to do with Luce.

50:36.534 --> 50:38.234
We don't really
talk a lot anymore.

50:38.236 --> 50:42.838
Oh, you don't?
Not since we broke up.

50:42.840 --> 50:44.206
What?

50:44.208 --> 50:45.975
You didn't know
we broke up?

50:45.977 --> 50:47.743
I didn't know you dated.

50:48.546 --> 50:49.612
Oh.

50:51.382 --> 50:53.449
Um, for how long?

50:55.753 --> 50:57.586
Um... Mrs. Edgar,

50:57.588 --> 50:59.155
I don't feel
comfortable

50:59.157 --> 51:00.923
telling you about me and Luce.
Yeah, of course.

51:00.925 --> 51:04.160
Because I don't know
why you want to know.

51:04.162 --> 51:07.363
Okay. Let me explain myself.
Yeah.

51:07.365 --> 51:10.366
This is about Harriet Wilson.
What?

51:10.368 --> 51:12.568
I need to know
what she did to you.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.203
Because Luce told us

51:14.205 --> 51:17.106
that when she found out
what happened at the party...

51:17.108 --> 51:20.076
Luce swore he wouldn't tell
what happened at the party.

51:20.078 --> 51:22.178
I thought he didn't know
what happened.

51:24.382 --> 51:25.414
I should go.

51:25.416 --> 51:27.283
No, wait.
Stephanie, please.

51:27.285 --> 51:29.051
Listen to me.

51:29.053 --> 51:32.521
I just want to know
the truth, Okay?

51:32.523 --> 51:35.791
Now, if Ms. Wilson made you
feel like whatever happened

51:35.793 --> 51:39.061
should be some kind of
a political statement,

51:39.063 --> 51:40.596
then that's wrong of her.

51:40.598 --> 51:44.100
As women what we need to do
is support each other.

51:44.102 --> 51:45.201
Do you understand?

51:47.038 --> 51:48.270
I'm not sure.

51:48.272 --> 51:50.406
I want to support you.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.341
You deserve to be supported.

51:57.048 --> 51:58.047
Okay.

52:02.386 --> 52:05.421
But for me to do that
I need to know what happened.

52:05.423 --> 52:08.257
It's easy to say that.

52:08.259 --> 52:11.794
But once you know something,
you can't un-know it.

52:11.796 --> 52:14.497
I want to know,
no matter what.

52:16.067 --> 52:17.333
Please.

52:23.407 --> 52:27.209
[crickets chirping]

52:31.282 --> 52:33.048
[engine cuts]

52:37.355 --> 52:40.789
Harriet, please...

52:40.791 --> 52:43.826
I'm sorry. I can't think of
any other way to resolve this.

52:43.828 --> 52:47.029
You suffer from
a condition, Ro.

52:47.031 --> 52:50.032
And it's clear my home is no
longer an ideal environment.

52:50.034 --> 52:51.534
You sound like
one of them doctors

52:51.536 --> 52:52.868
she about to
dump me with again.

52:52.870 --> 52:55.337
I'm not dumping you.
Oh really?

52:55.339 --> 52:56.906
That's what it
feels like, Harriet!

52:59.143 --> 53:00.809
[whimpers]
Come on, now.

53:00.811 --> 53:03.045
Don't make a scene.
Don't make a scene.

53:03.047 --> 53:04.847
Harriet!

53:06.284 --> 53:07.616
Ro...
It's fine.

53:07.618 --> 53:09.218
It's fine, it's fine...

53:09.220 --> 53:10.452
It's fine!

53:20.064 --> 53:23.899
Harriet!
[whimpering]

53:28.506 --> 53:30.039
Orlicki had a party.

53:32.810 --> 53:34.376
I was drunk.

53:34.378 --> 53:36.745
I had gone with two friends.
All three of us were drunk.

53:36.747 --> 53:39.181
Please don't tell anyone
this, it's embarrassing.

53:39.183 --> 53:42.218
No, no, this is between us.
I promise.

53:43.854 --> 53:49.024
People kept having shots of
stuff that tasted like syrup

53:49.026 --> 53:52.995
and I just kept drinking it
because it was easy

53:52.997 --> 53:55.731
but I got dizzy.

53:56.734 --> 53:58.334
I lost my friends.

54:00.204 --> 54:02.938
Orlicki found me and told me
to go lie down in the basement.

54:05.176 --> 54:07.076
It was dark.

54:07.078 --> 54:08.611
I couldn't see.

54:10.214 --> 54:11.780
I felt my way
over to the couch

54:11.782 --> 54:13.682
but there were
people there.

54:15.753 --> 54:18.587
Next, someone said we should
play the Santa Claus game.

54:18.589 --> 54:19.588
What's that?

54:20.791 --> 54:24.226
It's this stupid game
that guys play

54:24.228 --> 54:27.229
where a girl gets passed
around from lap to lap

54:27.231 --> 54:29.131
and depending on how far
she lets them go

54:29.133 --> 54:31.467
or how much they like you
sitting on them,

54:31.469 --> 54:33.702
they rate you
from one to three.

54:33.704 --> 54:34.970
Ho ho hos.

54:34.972 --> 54:36.538
My God, that can't be real.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.275
There are worse games.

54:40.911 --> 54:41.877
Anyway,

54:43.247 --> 54:44.980
they started
passing me around.

54:46.317 --> 54:49.618
I kept thinking,
"God,

54:49.620 --> 54:51.820
what if I throw up
right now?

54:51.822 --> 54:53.722
How embarrassing
would that be?"

54:55.993 --> 54:58.527
When they started,
they were laughing.

54:59.563 --> 55:01.330
But the longer
it went on...

55:03.067 --> 55:07.202
And it felt like
it went on forever.

55:09.407 --> 55:12.975
All I could hear
was breathing.

55:15.179 --> 55:17.079
Breathing,

55:17.081 --> 55:19.915
and counting.

55:19.917 --> 55:22.051
One, two,

55:23.254 --> 55:24.920
two,

55:24.922 --> 55:26.088
three...

55:26.991 --> 55:29.858
One, two...

55:31.128 --> 55:32.127
At some point

55:32.129 --> 55:33.495
I definitely said

55:33.497 --> 55:34.963
I wanted them to stop.

55:34.965 --> 55:37.132
But maybe it sounded
like I was joking

55:37.134 --> 55:40.336
or maybe it was just something
I said to myself in my head...

55:42.373 --> 55:46.075
There were hands
everywhere.

55:48.379 --> 55:50.746
It was like
they were swallowing me.

55:53.884 --> 55:56.385
And sometimes
in their laps

55:58.022 --> 56:01.256
I could feel...
[sniffles]

56:02.693 --> 56:04.093
Oh!
[sniffling]

56:04.962 --> 56:05.928
Oh.

56:07.465 --> 56:08.897
Gross.
[nervous chuckle]

56:11.969 --> 56:13.502
Um.

56:13.504 --> 56:17.072
When I woke up,
Luce was there.

56:17.074 --> 56:19.007
He said he found them
and told them to stop.

56:19.009 --> 56:20.509
[laughs nervously]

56:20.511 --> 56:22.778
And he stayed with me
the rest of the night.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.249
Is it possible that...?

56:28.853 --> 56:30.152
Was Luce one of the guys?

56:30.154 --> 56:31.987
He wouldn't do that.

56:31.989 --> 56:33.655
But he...
He just wouldn't.

56:39.497 --> 56:40.996
What happened
with Ms. Wilson?

56:42.533 --> 56:45.100
There were
a lot of rumors.

56:46.704 --> 56:48.370
It was
at the same time

56:48.372 --> 56:50.205
Deshaun Meeks got
kicked off the team

56:50.207 --> 56:53.242
because Wilson found
weed in his locker.

56:53.244 --> 56:56.578
She searched
Deshaun's locker?

56:56.580 --> 56:58.514
And called
the cops.

56:58.516 --> 57:01.583
I didn't want that.
What would I say?

57:01.585 --> 57:03.118
I couldn't
remember anything

57:03.120 --> 57:07.089
and I definitely didn't tell
everyone I was drunk.

57:07.091 --> 57:08.257
What did Luce say?

57:09.360 --> 57:12.261
He said I was right
not to tell.

57:13.631 --> 57:15.898
Because he was protecting
his friends.

57:15.900 --> 57:17.733
Because he was
protecting me.

57:17.735 --> 57:20.436
He didn't want me to do
anything I didn't want to do.

57:25.876 --> 57:27.309
Why did you two break up?

57:28.746 --> 57:29.778
I don't know.

57:31.615 --> 57:32.848
I miss him.

57:34.251 --> 57:36.351
He's the best boyfriend
I ever had.

57:40.458 --> 57:41.490
[sniffles]

57:43.761 --> 57:45.127
Stephanie...

57:46.330 --> 57:48.497
I'm really sorry
for what happened.

57:48.499 --> 57:49.498
Don't be.

57:49.500 --> 57:50.499
[chuckles]

57:52.002 --> 57:53.402
Everything is fine now.

Oh, really?

58:54.832 --> 58:57.065
Karen seems good.
Yeah, she is.

58:58.302 --> 58:59.568
They're happy.

59:00.571 --> 59:02.838
The baby fidgets.

59:02.840 --> 59:05.874
Mm-hm. I think that's
just a baby thing.

59:07.578 --> 59:09.411
[Amy giggles]

59:10.514 --> 59:11.747
Are you drunk?

59:11.749 --> 59:13.048
[Peter chuckles]

59:15.352 --> 59:19.187
So you don't think it's
that baby in particular.

59:19.189 --> 59:20.222
How would I know?

59:21.492 --> 59:23.592
I mean,
I don't know, so...

59:24.328 --> 59:26.028
how would I know?

59:26.030 --> 59:27.095
Yeah.

59:27.831 --> 59:29.331
PETER: Right?

59:29.333 --> 59:32.434
Mm, yeah,
I guess you wouldn't.

59:32.436 --> 59:33.669
PETER:
No.

59:34.939 --> 59:37.372
AMY:
You know, it's not Luce's fault

59:37.374 --> 59:39.575
you were denied diaper
changing privileges.

59:39.577 --> 59:41.810
No.
[chuckles]

59:44.214 --> 59:45.914
Thanks.

59:45.916 --> 59:47.549
Look, we made a choice.

59:47.551 --> 59:50.419
I'm okay with that as long
as you recognize it cost us.

59:51.355 --> 59:52.421
Which means?

59:53.691 --> 59:56.291
I did want something
different once.

59:56.293 --> 59:57.859
Ten years and
you're trapped.

59:58.562 --> 01:00:00.095
Your words.

01:00:00.097 --> 01:00:02.631
Well, you said it.
You wanted something different.

01:00:02.633 --> 01:00:05.233
I did, yeah.
Like what?

01:00:05.235 --> 01:00:09.104
Look, I'm proud of our son.

01:00:10.541 --> 01:00:13.809
Okay, I love him.
I love him

01:00:13.811 --> 01:00:17.212
more than I'll ever
understand, okay?

01:00:17.214 --> 01:00:20.415
But we spent years
with him in therapy

01:00:20.417 --> 01:00:22.217
and rehabilitation.

01:00:22.219 --> 01:00:23.752
Our friends
couldn't understand

01:00:23.754 --> 01:00:26.622
why we didn't just
have a kid of our own.

01:00:26.624 --> 01:00:28.256
And so while they
fell away doing

01:00:28.258 --> 01:00:31.493
what normal
fucking people do,

01:00:31.495 --> 01:00:33.962
we worked our asses off
to give him a life,

01:00:33.964 --> 01:00:37.432
at the expense of our own.
So to pretend that

01:00:37.434 --> 01:00:39.267
that didn't
cost us anything

01:00:39.269 --> 01:00:40.636
is bullshit.
I wasn't pretending.

01:00:40.638 --> 01:00:43.138
You are!
Amy.

01:00:44.842 --> 01:00:45.841
You are.

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:49.177
You want so
desperately for him

01:00:49.179 --> 01:00:50.912
to be what you want him to be,
you're ignoring

01:00:50.914 --> 01:00:52.781
what's right
in front of you.

01:00:52.783 --> 01:00:54.149
What he is, is

01:00:55.119 --> 01:00:57.319
our son.
Right.

01:00:57.321 --> 01:00:59.087
And nothing's going
to change that.

01:01:00.124 --> 01:01:01.256
Right.

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.393
So...

01:01:06.263 --> 01:01:07.329
fuck this.

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:08.664
Fuck you.

[¶¶¶]

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.542
[sighs]

01:01:23.814 --> 01:01:25.013
I came here

01:01:25.849 --> 01:01:27.849
to America,

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:29.418
to this school,

01:01:30.988 --> 01:01:32.387
and I found myself.

01:01:36.727 --> 01:01:39.695
When I first met my mother,
she couldn't pronounce my name.

01:01:41.131 --> 01:01:44.566
She tried over and over
to get the emphasis

01:01:44.568 --> 01:01:47.402
on the syllables
correct, but...

01:01:47.404 --> 01:01:48.637
she just couldn't.

01:01:51.341 --> 01:01:54.042
So my father suggested
that they rename me.

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:04.886
They picked Luce,

01:02:04.888 --> 01:02:06.154
and, uh...

01:02:10.260 --> 01:02:12.360
[breath trembles]

01:02:12.362 --> 01:02:14.529
I thought about that
when I was figuring out

01:02:14.531 --> 01:02:16.331
what to say
to you all tonight.

01:02:18.902 --> 01:02:21.903
And I realized how lucky
I am to be an American.

01:02:25.342 --> 01:02:27.509
Because here I got
the chance to start over.

01:02:29.279 --> 01:02:30.979
To redefine myself.

01:02:33.183 --> 01:02:35.484
Here we can be who we choose.
Here...

01:02:40.290 --> 01:02:44.659
[somber low strings]

01:03:11.221 --> 01:03:14.990
[heavy breathing]
[bed knocking]

01:03:14.992 --> 01:03:17.726
[knocking continues]

01:03:19.730 --> 01:03:22.964
[sighs]

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:32.541
Remember that fish
we got him for his birthday?

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:40.282
Dennis.
Yeah, that's right.

01:03:40.284 --> 01:03:42.818
Yeah. Poor Dennis.

01:03:44.955 --> 01:03:47.989
Yeah. The way he just
pulled him out

01:03:47.991 --> 01:03:50.525
and threw him across
the room like that.

01:03:50.527 --> 01:03:52.894
Like a piece
of deli meat.

01:03:55.098 --> 01:03:57.232
"I just wanted
to see him fly, mom."

01:04:03.841 --> 01:04:05.740
We didn't screw up,
did we?

01:04:08.512 --> 01:04:09.611
No.

01:04:12.516 --> 01:04:14.049
Everything's fine.

01:04:15.452 --> 01:04:17.552
[¶¶¶]

01:04:17.554 --> 01:04:20.121
[Peter and Amy
talking indistinctly]

01:04:22.226 --> 01:04:24.059
[cell phone chimes]

01:04:27.698 --> 01:04:30.232
[typing]

01:04:49.152 --> 01:04:50.485
[phone clicks off]

01:04:52.556 --> 01:04:55.323
[school bell rings]

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:03.265
So, what does it mean
to speak in code?

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:06.334
Well, it tells you about
a particular group.

01:05:06.336 --> 01:05:08.403
The necessity to have
a shared vocabulary.

01:05:08.405 --> 01:05:09.604
[door opens]
LUCE: Sorry.

01:05:12.242 --> 01:05:17.112
To have common struggles
in a society.

01:05:17.114 --> 01:05:19.014
You see,
language is a bond.

01:05:19.016 --> 01:05:21.182
It's how we tell each other
apart, but more importantly,

01:05:21.184 --> 01:05:22.550
it's how we stick together.

01:05:22.552 --> 01:05:24.619
[knock at door]
Excuse me, Ms. Wilson,

01:05:24.621 --> 01:05:26.421
I need you to come
with me please.

01:05:26.423 --> 01:05:27.656
Right now.

01:05:28.926 --> 01:05:31.793
[murmuring]

01:05:34.398 --> 01:05:37.699
[commotion grows louder]

01:05:39.436 --> 01:05:41.803
ROSE: Where's my sister?

01:05:41.805 --> 01:05:43.471
She works here. She is here.

01:05:43.473 --> 01:05:44.873
Rosemary!
Where's my sister?

01:05:44.875 --> 01:05:49.144
Rosemary! I'm right here.
I'm right here.

01:05:49.146 --> 01:05:50.478
Now come on,
let's go home.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.814
You don't want me at home.
That's not true.

01:05:52.816 --> 01:05:56.418
You won't...
You're ashamed of me.

01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:57.819
I am not.

01:05:57.821 --> 01:06:01.122
[stuttering]
You hate me.

01:06:01.124 --> 01:06:02.958
Don't talk nonsense, Ro.
You hate me.

01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.160
Shh. Look at me.

01:06:05.162 --> 01:06:06.995
DAN:
Hey, hey!
Put those phones away.

01:06:06.997 --> 01:06:10.598
You're embarrassed.
You're embarrassed!

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.834
You're embarrassed!
Stop this!

01:06:12.836 --> 01:06:14.235
Stop it right now, Rose!

01:06:14.237 --> 01:06:18.006
She's embarrassed!
She's embarrassed of me!

01:06:18.008 --> 01:06:19.474
You're embarrassed of me!

01:06:19.476 --> 01:06:23.511
I am your black
nigger bitch sister!

01:06:23.513 --> 01:06:27.115
This your blood.
Not these white folk.

01:06:27.117 --> 01:06:29.851
I am your blood.
You can't get rid of blood.

01:06:29.853 --> 01:06:35.323
You can't run from blood!
I am your sister! You...

01:06:35.325 --> 01:06:36.825
COP:
Hey!

01:06:36.827 --> 01:06:39.828
She's-she's sick officers.
Don't run!

01:06:39.830 --> 01:06:42.197
Relax! Calm down!

01:06:42.199 --> 01:06:43.264
Relax.

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:44.632
Get off of me!
Get off of me!

01:06:44.634 --> 01:06:46.167
Calm down.
Get off of me!

01:06:46.169 --> 01:06:47.602
Relax or
you'll be tased.

01:06:47.604 --> 01:06:49.437
MS. WILSON: Calm down.
Get off of me!

01:06:49.439 --> 01:06:50.805
I'm going to tase you!

01:06:50.807 --> 01:06:53.174
Calm down! Please!
Relax!

01:06:53.777 --> 01:06:55.443
Please.

01:06:55.445 --> 01:06:57.379
[taser crackles]
[screaming]

01:06:57.881 --> 01:06:59.280
No!

01:06:59.282 --> 01:07:02.817
ROSE:
Harriet, Harriet...
Harriet!

01:07:02.819 --> 01:07:04.819
Calm down!

01:07:04.821 --> 01:07:07.188
Can you cover her up?

01:07:07.190 --> 01:07:09.524
Can you please
just cover her up?

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:12.027
DAN:
Put the phones down.
Get back to class now.

01:07:12.029 --> 01:07:14.162
Give me your phone.
Come on!

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:16.798
I want every single phone
in this hallway

01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:18.867
in my office
right now.

01:07:18.869 --> 01:07:20.301
Every cell phone!

01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:26.341
[police siren wails]

01:07:26.343 --> 01:07:28.743
[footsteps recede]

01:07:34.985 --> 01:07:39.421
GIRL:
My God! I've never seen anything
like it in my entire life.

01:07:39.423 --> 01:07:42.424
It was insane.

01:07:42.426 --> 01:07:45.126
Who knew that Ms. Wilson's
family was so fucked up?

01:07:49.833 --> 01:07:51.533
<i> I am your black, nigger...</i>

01:07:51.535 --> 01:07:53.835
This was today?
Yeah, it's crazy, huh?

01:07:56.606 --> 01:07:57.972
AMY:
Oh my God!

01:07:59.342 --> 01:08:01.409
AMY: Oh, come on.
PETER: Oh, fuck.

01:08:03.013 --> 01:08:04.612
Where's Harriet?

01:08:04.614 --> 01:08:06.714
Um, I think she spent
most of the day

01:08:06.716 --> 01:08:09.017
at the police station
with her sister.

01:08:09.019 --> 01:08:10.585
Just goes to show you.

01:08:11.288 --> 01:08:12.287
What?

01:08:12.289 --> 01:08:14.556
Nothing, it's just...

01:08:14.558 --> 01:08:17.358
You never really know what's
going on with people.

01:08:17.359 --> 01:08:20.962
Like, in life.
Outside of what you know.

01:08:20.964 --> 01:08:22.997
I shouldn't have said
she was a bitch.

01:08:26.603 --> 01:08:29.970
Well, I think I owe you
an apology, Luce.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:32.740
For what?
Really.

01:08:32.742 --> 01:08:34.742
You've never given me any
reason to doubt your integrity.

01:08:34.743 --> 01:08:37.578
You should know
we got your back.

01:08:37.581 --> 01:08:40.948
No matter what?
No matter what. Asshole.

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.290

<i> get back to class now.</i>

[crickets chirping]

[dog barking]

01:09:25.162 --> 01:09:26.861

01:10:04.868 --> 01:10:06.067
[lock clicks]

01:10:10.473 --> 01:10:11.739
[knock at door]

01:10:13.476 --> 01:10:14.742
Who is it?

01:10:20.016 --> 01:10:21.616
I need to talk to you
about Luce.

01:10:32.162 --> 01:10:34.562
Harriet, if you Googled
"model student"

01:10:34.564 --> 01:10:37.031
Luce Edgar's picture would
come up on the computer

01:10:37.033 --> 01:10:40.168
and now you're telling me that
this kid, graffiti-ed your home?

01:10:40.170 --> 01:10:41.736
It's not just
the graffiti, Dan.

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.571
No, he also wrote
an upsetting paper.

01:10:43.573 --> 01:10:44.772
He argued violence--
A paper

01:10:44.774 --> 01:10:46.241
that you no longer
have a copy of.

01:10:46.243 --> 01:10:47.442
I gave it to his mother.

01:10:47.444 --> 01:10:49.043
An upsetting paper
where it sounds

01:10:49.045 --> 01:10:51.713
like he did exactly what the
assignment asked him to do.

01:10:51.715 --> 01:10:53.781
I know the difference
between miscommunication

01:10:53.783 --> 01:10:56.517
and provocation. I can tell
the difference between them.

01:10:56.519 --> 01:10:58.886
Isn't there a chance,
just maybe,

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:02.690
that what he wrote
just went over your head?

01:11:02.692 --> 01:11:04.659
I don't mean that
as a dig.

01:11:05.962 --> 01:11:07.762
Come on,
I think you're brilliant.

01:11:07.764 --> 01:11:09.864
I think you're articulate,
you're a great teacher,

01:11:09.866 --> 01:11:13.534
but you know, we all misread
signals from time to time.

01:11:15.572 --> 01:11:17.772
There's an allegation
of sexual assault.

01:11:19.709 --> 01:11:21.709
A student
came to me and said

01:11:21.711 --> 01:11:24.045
Luce sexually assaulted
her at a party.

01:11:25.882 --> 01:11:27.181
[exhales]

01:11:31.221 --> 01:11:32.387
Which student?
Dan...

01:11:32.389 --> 01:11:33.988
You're talking
about a crime now.

01:11:35.759 --> 01:11:37.892
I'm not gonna ruin a kid's
life because you come here

01:11:37.894 --> 01:11:41.095
with some unsubstantiated
accusations and hunches.

01:11:41.097 --> 01:11:42.563
Then let me prove it.

01:11:44.100 --> 01:11:46.067
[water bubbling]

01:11:47.570 --> 01:11:49.170
Hey, what's up?

01:11:51.941 --> 01:11:54.142
I didn't buy it before but
maybe you're right, maybe

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:56.477
she has some kind of weird
vendetta thing for Luce.

01:11:56.479 --> 01:11:58.012
<i> Okay, hold on.</i>

01:11:58.014 --> 01:11:59.814
<i> She doesn't get</i>
<i> what she wants out of you</i>

01:11:59.816 --> 01:12:01.149
<i> so then she comes to me.</i>

01:12:01.151 --> 01:12:03.418
Then when that doesn't
work she goes to Dan.

01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:06.587
She's having a personal crisis,
she's taking it out on our son.

01:12:06.589 --> 01:12:08.356
<i> Just let me handle it.</i>
<i> Just let me.</i>

01:12:08.358 --> 01:12:11.993
<i> Okay. </i>
Okay. Bye.

01:12:41.291 --> 01:12:42.557
What are you
doing home?

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:46.027
Hey! I, uh,

01:12:46.029 --> 01:12:48.730
just needed to pick up
a few things before practice.

01:12:51.901 --> 01:12:53.634
You see Dan's email?
Yeah.

01:12:53.636 --> 01:12:55.036
I'm not sure
what it's about.

01:12:56.306 --> 01:12:57.905
I guess we'll just
wait and see.

01:12:57.907 --> 01:12:59.040
Guess so.

01:13:00.744 --> 01:13:03.211
I'm, um, I'm taking
your advice you know.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:05.413
About what?

01:13:05.415 --> 01:13:07.248
The speech.

01:13:07.250 --> 01:13:10.818
I'm making it more personal.
I think you'll be proud.

01:13:12.856 --> 01:13:14.122
I'm sure I will be.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.158
So, um,

01:13:17.160 --> 01:13:18.526
I'll see you
at the meeting.

01:13:18.528 --> 01:13:20.428
Six o'clock sharp.
Great.

01:13:26.336 --> 01:13:28.636
Why didn't you tell me
you talked to Stephanie?

01:13:30.273 --> 01:13:32.273
You didn't think
she would tell me?

01:13:34.577 --> 01:13:36.677
I don't think either of us
have been great

01:13:36.679 --> 01:13:38.246
at keeping each other
in the loop, Luce.

01:13:38.248 --> 01:13:39.947
What are you
trying to prove?

01:13:39.949 --> 01:13:41.349
What are you
trying to hide?

01:13:41.351 --> 01:13:42.917
I'm not trying
to hide anything.

01:13:42.919 --> 01:13:45.553
That's not the impression
I got from Stephanie.

01:13:45.555 --> 01:13:47.455
What did she say?
You tell me.

01:13:47.457 --> 01:13:49.123
You're the one
that talked to her.

01:13:49.125 --> 01:13:50.124
Stop it.
Stop what?

01:13:50.126 --> 01:13:51.726
This game.
What game?

01:13:51.728 --> 01:13:54.195
What did you do to that girl?
What, you think I--?

01:13:54.197 --> 01:13:56.230
Never mind what I think.
What did you do to her?

01:13:56.232 --> 01:13:58.399
I did the right thing.
By lying?

01:13:58.401 --> 01:14:00.301
She threatened to kill herself.
Ms. Wilson kept pushing...

01:14:00.303 --> 01:14:02.737
By protecting
the people who hurt her?

01:14:02.739 --> 01:14:04.038
I wanted her
to get better.

01:14:04.040 --> 01:14:05.473
Then why didn't you
ask for help?

01:14:05.475 --> 01:14:07.108
She was better.
I think you're lying.

01:14:07.110 --> 01:14:08.743
I'm not lying.
Tell me the truth.

01:14:08.745 --> 01:14:10.912
I'm telling you the truth.
Stop lying to me.

01:14:10.914 --> 01:14:13.648
I'm not lying.
Tell me the fucking truth!

01:14:21.825 --> 01:14:23.825
Why did you write that paper?

01:14:26.296 --> 01:14:28.996
What if I told you
it's what I believed?

01:14:29.766 --> 01:14:30.898
You believe in

01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:33.401
hurting people
to make a point?

01:14:33.403 --> 01:14:35.636
You wouldn't know.
You never read it, right?

01:14:39.242 --> 01:14:40.208
[exhales]

01:14:41.277 --> 01:14:42.577
Luce...

01:14:49.619 --> 01:14:50.918
I feel like...

01:14:53.289 --> 01:14:55.890
you're all waiting for me
to confirm this thing...

01:14:57.327 --> 01:14:59.227
that no one wants
to say aloud.

01:15:00.630 --> 01:15:02.497
And I'm trying
so hard

01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:05.166
not to be that.

01:15:07.170 --> 01:15:09.537
But after a while you can't
help but think that maybe

01:15:09.539 --> 01:15:11.506
you're fighting a losing battle.
What do you mean?

01:15:11.508 --> 01:15:12.940
I mean

01:15:12.942 --> 01:15:15.343
it's like I only get
to be a saint or a monster.

01:15:15.345 --> 01:15:18.045
That's not true.
We always accepted you

01:15:18.047 --> 01:15:19.347
for whoever you are.

01:15:19.349 --> 01:15:20.948
I don't believe you, Amy.

01:15:22.719 --> 01:15:26.354
And I feel like I'm suffocating.
Like I can't breathe.

01:15:26.356 --> 01:15:29.457
That's why I'm here,
to help you and to protect you.

01:15:29.459 --> 01:15:31.959
What if you're part of what
I need protecting from?

01:15:34.464 --> 01:15:36.063
[cell phone chimes]

01:15:45.375 --> 01:15:46.941
I'm gonna be late, um...

01:15:48.811 --> 01:15:50.211
I'll see you
at the meeting.

01:15:56.886 --> 01:16:00.421
[door opens and closes]

01:16:01.391 --> 01:16:02.557
[sobs]

01:16:18.341 --> 01:16:21.242
I promise it'll be as
painless as possible.

01:16:21.244 --> 01:16:23.344
We'll be just
down the hall.

01:16:23.346 --> 01:16:26.213
When the time comes,
I'll escort you in and

01:16:26.215 --> 01:16:28.249
you just tell them
what you told me.

01:16:28.251 --> 01:16:29.850
And then that's it,
you're done.

01:16:29.852 --> 01:16:31.419
Luce will be there?

01:16:31.421 --> 01:16:33.588
I can have him step out when
it's time for you to speak.

01:16:33.590 --> 01:16:35.690
What about his mom?

01:16:35.692 --> 01:16:36.691
She'll be there.

01:16:36.693 --> 01:16:38.259
Yes.

01:16:38.261 --> 01:16:40.094
Hey, hey, hey!

01:16:40.897 --> 01:16:41.996
You're brave.

01:16:43.399 --> 01:16:45.299
It's because you show
courage today, that

01:16:45.301 --> 01:16:47.802
someone else doesn't suffer
like you did tomorrow.

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:50.972
You understand?

01:16:53.576 --> 01:16:54.809
Good.

01:16:56.079 --> 01:16:57.211
Good.

01:16:58.247 --> 01:16:59.213

Five, six, seven, eight.

DAN:
Hey, guys. Come on in.

01:17:47.664 --> 01:17:48.963
How you doing, Amy?

01:17:48.965 --> 01:17:50.831
How you doing, Peter?
Good to see you.

01:17:50.833 --> 01:17:52.700
Hey, Dan.
Dan.

01:17:52.702 --> 01:17:54.502
You all right?
Been better.

01:17:54.504 --> 01:17:56.470
How's the clinic?
Busy. Always busy.

01:17:56.472 --> 01:17:58.272
Busy is good.
Yeah.

01:17:58.274 --> 01:17:59.907
Busy is always good.
[laughs]

01:18:01.344 --> 01:18:03.010
Here she is.

01:18:04.814 --> 01:18:06.547
Harriet Wilson.

01:18:06.549 --> 01:18:08.616
You know
Peter and Amy Edgar.

01:18:08.618 --> 01:18:10.284
Good to see you, Amy. Peter.
Good to see you, too.

01:18:10.286 --> 01:18:12.119
Good to see you.

01:18:12.121 --> 01:18:15.189
So we're just, uh, missing
the man of the hour here.

01:18:16.826 --> 01:18:18.626
He should be along here.

01:18:18.628 --> 01:18:19.627
Ah-ha!

01:18:19.629 --> 01:18:21.796
Hey!
Hey. Sorry, sorry.

01:18:21.798 --> 01:18:24.165
I lost track of time.
Lost track at the track.

01:18:24.167 --> 01:18:26.200
Sounds like the Luce I know.
[chuckles]

01:18:26.202 --> 01:18:28.202
How are you?
I'm great, Principal Towson.

01:18:28.204 --> 01:18:29.837
How are you?
Principal Towson.

01:18:29.839 --> 01:18:32.406
Notice he's all formal
now that he's a senior.

01:18:32.408 --> 01:18:34.041
Getting ready
for college, right?

01:18:34.043 --> 01:18:37.311
That's right.
Smart man. Smart man.

01:18:37.313 --> 01:18:39.113
Have a seat, guys.
Come on, sit down.

01:18:40.683 --> 01:18:42.216
[sighs]

01:18:42.218 --> 01:18:43.350
So...
I'd like to...

01:18:43.352 --> 01:18:44.318
[crosstalk]

01:18:45.254 --> 01:18:46.721
Go ahead.
You first.

01:18:46.723 --> 01:18:49.490
Well, I guess
first things first.

01:18:49.492 --> 01:18:53.027
There have been a series
of miscommunications

01:18:53.029 --> 01:18:56.597
and I think rather than try
to hash all that out,

01:18:56.599 --> 01:19:01.202
it's probably more productive
to just acknowledge

01:19:01.204 --> 01:19:03.671
some tension has developed
between Luce and me.

01:19:03.673 --> 01:19:05.206
MS. WILSON:
It happens.

01:19:05.208 --> 01:19:07.241
Signals get crossed
and we have to find

01:19:07.243 --> 01:19:09.043
a way to untangle the knots,

01:19:09.045 --> 01:19:12.179
even if we're not sure how those
knots got there in first place.

01:19:12.181 --> 01:19:13.414
LUCE:
Definitely. And, um.

01:19:13.416 --> 01:19:15.583
Um, I just want to apologize

01:19:15.585 --> 01:19:18.052
for making you feel
disrespected.

01:19:18.054 --> 01:19:19.720
I've taken on a lot
this semester,

01:19:19.722 --> 01:19:22.356
and not that that's an excuse,
it's not but...

01:19:22.358 --> 01:19:25.993
I haven't been my best self
lately and I'm sorry for that.

01:19:28.264 --> 01:19:29.864
Thank you, Luce.
You're welcome.

01:19:31.367 --> 01:19:33.300
This is going really
well, I think, so far.

01:19:33.302 --> 01:19:34.902
Let's talk about
the threat.

01:19:34.904 --> 01:19:37.104
Oh, I'm sorry for that too,
Ms. Wilson.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:38.105
Sorry?

01:19:38.107 --> 01:19:39.473
Are you admitting it now?

01:19:39.475 --> 01:19:40.975
Like I was saying, uh,

01:19:40.977 --> 01:19:42.643
given the stress
I've been under,

01:19:42.645 --> 01:19:44.612
I'm sure what I said
sounded a bit--

01:19:44.614 --> 01:19:47.548
No, no, no. I'm sorry,
but this isn't about some

01:19:47.550 --> 01:19:49.750
stress-induced
problem of tone.

01:19:49.752 --> 01:19:50.985
This is about
one person

01:19:50.987 --> 01:19:52.586
suggesting violence
against another.

01:19:52.588 --> 01:19:54.488
Excuse me?
You weren't there, Mr. Edgar.

01:19:54.490 --> 01:19:56.724
There are interactions
that must be experienced

01:19:56.726 --> 01:19:58.325
in order to appreciate
their intent.

01:19:58.327 --> 01:19:59.827
Respectfully,

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:02.062
I think you should choose
your words more carefully.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:04.565
My son has just apologized.
Has he?

01:20:04.567 --> 01:20:07.501
I-I think in the interest
of moving forward, Harriet,

01:20:07.503 --> 01:20:10.171
it would be helpful for you to
acknowledge Luce did in fact

01:20:10.173 --> 01:20:12.573
apologize.
Where were you last night?

01:20:12.575 --> 01:20:15.776
LUCE: What?
My home was vandalized.

01:20:15.778 --> 01:20:17.178
Uh, just a second--

01:20:17.180 --> 01:20:18.612
I want to know
where you were between

01:20:18.614 --> 01:20:20.481
when school let out
and I got back to my house.

01:20:20.483 --> 01:20:22.917
I was out.
Where?

01:20:22.919 --> 01:20:24.351
Is my son being
accused of a crime?

01:20:24.353 --> 01:20:25.786
He sure as hell
is about to be.

01:20:25.788 --> 01:20:27.087
Because if he is,

01:20:27.089 --> 01:20:28.589
if he is being
accused of a crime,

01:20:28.591 --> 01:20:29.757
I want a lawyer.

01:20:29.759 --> 01:20:31.025
It's fine.
I didn't do anything.

01:20:31.027 --> 01:20:32.693
This woman's sister,

01:20:32.695 --> 01:20:35.296
this woman's sister has just
gone through a very public

01:20:35.298 --> 01:20:37.665
mental breakdown.
All right.

01:20:37.667 --> 01:20:39.266
How do you know
she's not responsible?

01:20:39.268 --> 01:20:40.634
My sister wouldn't do that.
Neither would my son.

01:20:40.636 --> 01:20:41.635
All right, okay.

01:20:41.637 --> 01:20:43.771
Everybody just... Luce,

01:20:44.774 --> 01:20:46.473
Can you help us out here?

01:20:46.475 --> 01:20:48.576
Can you tell us where you
were after school yesterday?

01:20:51.147 --> 01:20:52.646
I don't want to say.
Where were you?

01:20:56.285 --> 01:20:57.852
With friends.
MS. WILSON: Who?

01:20:59.722 --> 01:21:01.021
See, he's lying, Dan.

01:21:01.023 --> 01:21:02.690
Harriet!

01:21:02.692 --> 01:21:04.291
Principal Towson,
I can explain where I was

01:21:04.293 --> 01:21:06.627
but I do not want to
get people in trouble.

01:21:06.629 --> 01:21:08.562
I respect
your discretion, but,

01:21:08.564 --> 01:21:10.798
Luce, your mom,
your dad, Ms. Wilson,

01:21:10.800 --> 01:21:15.169
we're all just trying to pin
down what's going on here, okay?

01:21:15.171 --> 01:21:17.905
And if you know anything,
if you could help us with that,

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:19.540
it's-it's only going
to help you.

01:21:21.010 --> 01:21:22.543
It's embarrassing for me.

01:21:22.545 --> 01:21:24.144
[scoffs]
You gotta be kidding.

01:21:24.146 --> 01:21:25.746
Harriet.

01:21:28.384 --> 01:21:29.917
DAN:
Go ahead, Luce.

01:21:39.729 --> 01:21:42.196
Please don't tell anyone
I'm showing you this.

01:21:42.198 --> 01:21:43.664
It's a violation of trust.

01:21:49.772 --> 01:21:52.406
<i> Yeah! What up?</i>

01:21:52.408 --> 01:21:54.341

01:22:13.062 --> 01:22:14.361
I don't want them
to get in trouble.

01:22:14.363 --> 01:22:16.196
DAN:
No one's gonna get in trouble.

01:22:16.198 --> 01:22:17.698
All right, you guys
are good kids.

01:22:17.700 --> 01:22:18.966
We all know that.
This is bullshit.

01:22:18.968 --> 01:22:20.567
Hey, Harriet.
Excuse me.

01:22:20.569 --> 01:22:21.535
Harriet!

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:23.337
Harriet!

01:22:28.077 --> 01:22:29.043
Steph--

01:22:32.148 --> 01:22:34.581
I think that's
a really good choice for you.

01:22:34.583 --> 01:22:37.151
I know it wasn't on your
original list but I--

01:22:38.754 --> 01:22:40.421
You told her
to come to me.

01:22:40.423 --> 01:22:42.723
LUCE: I'm sorry?
You told her what to say.

01:22:42.725 --> 01:22:44.391
Dan, what is she talking about?

01:22:44.393 --> 01:22:45.960
DAN:
Please, explain, Harriet.

01:22:45.962 --> 01:22:48.329
I think Ms. Wilson's
just been through a lot.

01:22:48.331 --> 01:22:51.098
Between what's happened
with her sister's breakdown

01:22:51.100 --> 01:22:52.766
and someone
vandalizing her house.

01:22:52.768 --> 01:22:53.968
She's confused.

01:22:53.970 --> 01:22:56.570
Right, Ms. Wilson?
You're confused.

01:22:56.572 --> 01:22:58.339
Luce, I'm going to need you
to step out for a moment.

01:22:58.341 --> 01:23:00.774
LUCE:
I thought this meeting
was to get together

01:23:00.776 --> 01:23:01.976
and figure things out.

01:23:01.978 --> 01:23:03.844
I need to speak
with your parents

01:23:03.846 --> 01:23:06.647
and Principal Towson alone.
Please.

01:23:07.984 --> 01:23:09.750
Sure.
AMY: No.

01:23:09.752 --> 01:23:10.918
He can stay.

01:23:10.920 --> 01:23:11.986
Whatever you have
to say to us,

01:23:11.988 --> 01:23:13.654
you can say
in front of him.

01:23:15.257 --> 01:23:18.492
Your son brought illegal
fireworks onto school property.

01:23:18.494 --> 01:23:20.127
DAN: Excuse me?
I searches Luce's locker

01:23:20.129 --> 01:23:21.495
and I found illegal fireworks.

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:23.330
Why didn't you tell
me this, Harriet?

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:26.600
AMY: Well, hold on.
The kids share lockers, right?

01:23:26.602 --> 01:23:29.837
Well, it makes sense that given
the kind of student Luce is

01:23:29.839 --> 01:23:31.939
someone would think his
was the safe hiding place.

01:23:31.941 --> 01:23:34.108
The fireworks could have
belonged to anyone.

01:23:35.277 --> 01:23:36.543
LUCE:
I've learned my lesson.

01:23:36.545 --> 01:23:37.945
I'm going to change
my combination

01:23:37.947 --> 01:23:40.147
and we won't share
lockers anymore.

01:23:40.149 --> 01:23:43.684
Okay. Harriet,
where are the fireworks now?

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:46.286
Amy?

01:23:47.456 --> 01:23:48.422
Yes?

01:23:49.125 --> 01:23:50.557
Where are they?

01:23:50.559 --> 01:23:53.193
AMY: What do you mean?
I gave them to you.

01:23:55.998 --> 01:23:58.032
I don't know what
she's talking about.

01:23:58.034 --> 01:23:59.366
MS. WILSON:
What?

01:23:59.368 --> 01:24:00.968
Nope. She called me

01:24:00.970 --> 01:24:02.536
and she claimed
she found these fireworks.

01:24:02.538 --> 01:24:04.204
She claimed my son
threatened her.

01:24:04.206 --> 01:24:05.706
Amy!
And then she drags us

01:24:05.708 --> 01:24:07.875
down here in front of you,
Dan, and threatens

01:24:07.877 --> 01:24:09.309
legal action
against my son

01:24:09.311 --> 01:24:11.311
for a crime he clearly
didn't commit.

01:24:11.313 --> 01:24:13.680
I mean, I'm sorry
but are we done here?

01:24:13.682 --> 01:24:15.249
Can my son go back to
being the student he was

01:24:15.251 --> 01:24:17.818
before this woman
decided to go after him

01:24:17.820 --> 01:24:19.853
on some kind of insane
witch hunt?

01:24:19.855 --> 01:24:21.088
No, Peter...

01:24:21.857 --> 01:24:23.657
I think

01:24:23.659 --> 01:24:26.427
we're done here,
Harriet.

01:24:26.429 --> 01:24:28.729
No, no, no. Dan...

01:24:28.731 --> 01:24:29.730
Yeah, Harriet.

01:24:29.732 --> 01:24:32.499
We're done.
We are done.

01:24:32.501 --> 01:24:34.168
Amy, Peter,
thank you for coming.

01:24:34.170 --> 01:24:37.237
I'm very sorry about this.
I will make it up to you.

01:24:37.239 --> 01:24:39.940
I promise.
Luce, thank you.

01:24:39.942 --> 01:24:41.842
Good night, Principal Towson.
Thank you.

01:24:41.844 --> 01:24:43.510
All right, Ms. Wilson...

01:24:44.346 --> 01:24:45.345
Dan,

01:24:45.347 --> 01:24:46.580
Stephanie Kim was in my office.

01:24:46.582 --> 01:24:48.248
Just don't say anything.
No, Dan--

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:51.118
We're going to talk
tomorrow. okay?

01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:52.820
It's okay, we'll talk tomorrow.
No.

I can heat up leftovers
if anyone wants.

01:25:24.653 --> 01:25:26.053
PETER:
No, I'm good.

01:25:26.055 --> 01:25:28.555
Is he mad at me?
No, he's fine.

01:25:29.625 --> 01:25:30.624
He's just...

01:25:31.927 --> 01:25:33.594
Are you hungry?

01:25:33.596 --> 01:25:35.462
I should probably
get to my speech.

01:25:35.464 --> 01:25:39.099
Okay. Well, can't
wait to hear it.

01:25:39.101 --> 01:25:42.035
Thanks, Amy.
Good night.

Whoa! That smells good.

01:26:32.488 --> 01:26:35.656
I'm capable of a certain
level of domesticity.

01:26:41.497 --> 01:26:42.796
No, thanks.

01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:54.908
And the man period
continues unabated.

01:26:57.580 --> 01:26:59.079
Can I get a ride to school?

01:27:00.516 --> 01:27:01.882
You want me to drive you?

01:27:02.585 --> 01:27:03.917
Yeah, why not?

01:27:05.354 --> 01:27:06.320
Okay.

01:27:19.034 --> 01:27:20.434
I wonder what happened.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.840

I guess I'll let you know
if school gets canceled.

[indistinct

01:27:35.584 --> 01:27:38.118
This is an impossible situation.

01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:40.854
If you hadn't of hidden
those fireworks, Harriet...

01:27:42.191 --> 01:27:44.524
I've given this school
everything, Dan.

01:27:46.862 --> 01:27:48.362
For 15 years I've

01:27:48.364 --> 01:27:50.731
given everything
I have to these kids.

01:27:50.733 --> 01:27:51.965
They're my life.

01:27:53.402 --> 01:27:56.703
And you know I'm not
a liar. You know it.

01:27:58.907 --> 01:28:00.707
We'll start with
a leave of absence.

01:28:01.977 --> 01:28:03.577
There will be
an investigation.

01:28:03.579 --> 01:28:05.245
Then, Harriet, I have
to tell you this school

01:28:05.247 --> 01:28:06.813
can't stand
behind you.

01:28:23.098 --> 01:28:24.631

[Amy panting]
What?

01:28:45.187 --> 01:28:47.821
Was anyone hurt?
PETER: Mm-mm. No.

01:28:49.191 --> 01:28:53.260
Good. That's good.

01:28:55.297 --> 01:28:57.597
I think we have
an obligation here.

01:28:58.467 --> 01:29:00.033
What does that mean?

01:29:01.203 --> 01:29:03.103
Harriet's going
to lose her job.

01:29:04.807 --> 01:29:06.406
There was a fire.

01:29:08.477 --> 01:29:10.010
People might
have been hurt.

01:29:11.313 --> 01:29:12.713
No one was.

01:29:14.450 --> 01:29:16.550
Could have been Luce. Amy.

01:29:16.552 --> 01:29:18.719
He was with us
all night, Pete.

01:29:18.721 --> 01:29:20.454
So if you're accusing--
Really?

01:29:20.456 --> 01:29:21.955
No, if you're accusing him,

01:29:21.957 --> 01:29:25.058
just think carefully about
who's side you're on.

01:29:25.060 --> 01:29:27.728
Jesus...
We both wanted this.

01:29:27.730 --> 01:29:29.029
No, I wanted
a family.

01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:35.402
I wanted something simple
and sane and normal.

01:29:35.404 --> 01:29:38.372
Our lives didn't have to be
a political fucking statement.

01:29:39.208 --> 01:29:40.440
I didn't want...

01:29:43.512 --> 01:29:44.711
Him?

01:29:46.014 --> 01:29:48.548
Oh, I think there has to be...

01:29:50.185 --> 01:29:51.485
some kind of limit.

01:29:51.487 --> 01:29:53.754
AMY:
A limit to what? Tell me.

01:29:53.756 --> 01:29:56.022
To how much
I love him?

01:29:56.024 --> 01:29:58.525
To how hard
I've worked?

01:29:58.527 --> 01:30:01.528
To ensure he had a chance
at life, at success?

01:30:01.530 --> 01:30:02.729
No, Pete, I disagree.

01:30:02.731 --> 01:30:04.498
There is no limit to that

01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:06.233
and some random
accident at school--

01:30:06.235 --> 01:30:08.034
PETER: Ah, fuck, Amy!
Listen to me!

01:30:08.036 --> 01:30:12.339
Some random accident at school
is not going to change that.

01:30:16.211 --> 01:30:17.911
So just tell me...

You put me in a box.

After you busted him,

01:32:43.926 --> 01:32:46.560
you had that meeting
with me and Corey

runners on the squad.

And I remember them all
looking at me.

01:33:05.514 --> 01:33:07.180
They weren't jealous.

01:33:08.684 --> 01:33:10.784
They were just trying
to figure it out.

01:33:11.587 --> 01:33:13.286
How do I get that?

01:33:15.290 --> 01:33:17.591
And all I can think about
was Deshaun.

01:33:17.593 --> 01:33:19.926
All he had was that
athletic scholarship

01:33:19.928 --> 01:33:21.595
and you took it
from him.

01:33:21.597 --> 01:33:23.396
You took it from him
because he wasn't me.

01:33:23.398 --> 01:33:25.031
Yes.
Why?

01:33:25.033 --> 01:33:27.367
Because for every Deshaun
Meeks I don't come down on,

01:33:27.369 --> 01:33:29.035
there's a Luce Edgar
I can't lift out.

No, you're so
desperate for approval

just to get it.

Who do you think?

Everyone who made you feel like
being black wasn't good enough.

01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:47.721
But I don't need their approval.
I'm not going to be

make them feel better.

and it's not about me.

whether you like it or not.

And only so much light
gets in that box, Luce.

Some people get it,
and some people don't.

But it's not on you to decide
who gets it and who doesn't.

You're damn right
it's on you!

little man.

Now you get the fuck
out of my house.

01:34:59.561 --> 01:35:01.227

01:35:13.075 --> 01:35:15.341
[insects chirping]

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:18.411
[low airy music]

01:35:40.569 --> 01:35:43.269
[birds chirping]

01:36:03.725 --> 01:36:06.126
Shit! Shit!

01:36:25.714 --> 01:36:28.948
[children's voices playing]

01:36:41.329 --> 01:36:43.296
[basketballs bouncing]

01:37:08.623 --> 01:37:11.758
[music grows tense]

01:37:55.971 --> 01:37:58.404
[heavy moaning]

01:38:12.153 --> 01:38:15.922
[moaning continues]

01:38:29.371 --> 01:38:30.970
[door opens]

01:38:55.630 --> 01:38:58.131
[items clattering]

01:39:15.550 --> 01:39:16.816
[door opens]

01:39:23.258 --> 01:39:24.691
[door closes]

01:39:27.429 --> 01:39:29.662
[footsteps approach]

01:39:35.904 --> 01:39:37.070
Hey.

01:39:39.941 --> 01:39:41.007
Hey.

01:39:53.588 --> 01:39:55.855
[items clattering]

01:40:04.099 --> 01:40:05.898
Are you hiding
Christmas presents?

01:40:08.937 --> 01:40:11.771
That's where you used
to hide my Christmas presents.

01:40:15.443 --> 01:40:17.377
You were always
so surprised.

01:40:19.047 --> 01:40:21.047
I'm good at
acting surprised.

01:40:22.717 --> 01:40:23.850
[Luce gasps]

01:40:26.154 --> 01:40:27.120
[Luce chuckles]

01:40:32.694 --> 01:40:34.427
[zipper unzips]

01:40:38.166 --> 01:40:39.632
Here.

01:41:12.000 --> 01:41:13.466
LUCE: Remember Dennis?

01:41:14.269 --> 01:41:15.601
AMY:
Yeah.

01:41:17.539 --> 01:41:19.806
Of course
I remember Dennis.

01:41:23.344 --> 01:41:25.478
I thought
we could try again.

01:41:31.386 --> 01:41:33.152
Thanks...

01:41:35.023 --> 01:41:36.456
Mom.

01:41:42.964 --> 01:41:45.798
You have your whole
future ahead of you.

01:41:47.435 --> 01:41:49.202
Full of potential.

01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:53.539
Hope you're right.

01:41:54.409 --> 01:41:55.875
I know I'm right, honey.

01:41:58.313 --> 01:41:59.946
I know.

01:42:03.785 --> 01:42:05.318
[sniffles]

01:42:08.890 --> 01:42:10.990
[weeps]

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:23.136
[applause]

01:42:35.850 --> 01:42:37.917
Hi, everyone.

01:42:37.919 --> 01:42:41.254
I want thank Principal Towson
for giving me this opportunity.

01:42:41.256 --> 01:42:43.990
It means a lot to be able
to talk with each of you

01:42:43.992 --> 01:42:45.658
about my story,

01:42:45.660 --> 01:42:47.660
which I'm told
is pretty unique,

01:42:47.662 --> 01:42:49.695
even though I still feel
pretty regular.

01:42:51.799 --> 01:42:56.536
I'm lucky enough to have
two amazing parents

01:42:56.538 --> 01:42:57.937
who when they saw
my picture

01:42:57.939 --> 01:43:00.439
at seven years old
weren't scared.

01:43:00.441 --> 01:43:03.643
Or if they were they did a
good job of hiding it because

01:43:03.645 --> 01:43:06.179
the parents I grew up with were
nothing but loving and brave.

01:43:06.181 --> 01:43:08.080
AUDIENCE:
Aww!

01:43:09.984 --> 01:43:12.885
I came here
to America,

01:43:13.821 --> 01:43:15.188
to this school,

01:43:16.157 --> 01:43:17.790
and I found myself.

01:43:20.695 --> 01:43:24.697
When I first met my mother,
she couldn't pronounce my name.

01:43:24.699 --> 01:43:27.533
She tried over and over
to get the emphasis

01:43:27.535 --> 01:43:30.203
on the syllables correct,
but she just couldn't

01:43:30.205 --> 01:43:33.206
so my father suggested
that they rename me.

01:43:34.542 --> 01:43:37.977
They picked Luce,
which means light.

01:43:39.013 --> 01:43:40.646
Because my mom always said that

01:43:40.648 --> 01:43:43.516
there was a little beam
of light shone inside me.

01:43:43.518 --> 01:43:45.051
If only they could
sweep the darkness

01:43:45.053 --> 01:43:46.619
of those first
seven years away.

01:43:48.323 --> 01:43:50.089
I thought of that
as I was figuring out

01:43:50.091 --> 01:43:52.158
what to say to you all tonight.

01:43:54.095 --> 01:43:58.497
And I realized how lucky
I am to be an American.

01:44:01.569 --> 01:44:03.769
Because here I got
the chance to start over.

01:44:05.406 --> 01:44:08.040
Here we get to be who we are
and still be accepted

01:44:08.042 --> 01:44:09.175
despite our flaws.

01:44:10.511 --> 01:44:12.345
Here we get to tell
our own story.

01:44:14.882 --> 01:44:16.215
This is mine.

01:44:16.217 --> 01:44:17.850
[low airy music]

01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:20.886
When they first told me
my new name,

01:44:20.888 --> 01:44:22.955
I was still just
learning English,

01:44:22.957 --> 01:44:24.624
so I took it to be
the word "loose,"

01:44:24.626 --> 01:44:27.593
L-O-O-S-E,
[audience laughs]

01:44:27.595 --> 01:44:29.562
which is defined
as something detachable,

01:44:29.564 --> 01:44:32.531
not easily fixed in
place, or pinned down...

01:44:32.533 --> 01:44:34.333
[airy music continues]

01:44:45.647 --> 01:44:47.980
[inaudible]

01:44:50.318 --> 01:44:54.387
[crickets chirping]
[flagpole clanging]

01:44:56.758 --> 01:44:59.659
[panting]

01:45:05.300 --> 01:45:08.401
[panting increases]

01:45:13.775 --> 01:45:16.475
[music intensifies]

01:45:20.682 --> 01:45:22.915
[panting intensifies]

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:26.886
[grunts]

01:45:28.122 --> 01:45:29.889
[music stops]

01:45:33.461 --> 01:45:36.195
[low electronic beat]
