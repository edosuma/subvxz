He's got a playstyle
that I actually want

01:50.806 --> 01:52.112

He's so aggressive and he's

01:52.155 --> 01:53.809
mechanically talented.

01:53.852 --> 01:54.853
KOBE:
Exactly. And you've got
to get aggressive

01:54.897 --> 01:55.898
if you're losing every game.

01:55.941 --> 01:56.899
You got to find a way in!

01:56.942 --> 01:58.292
Honestly, if Organizm

01:58.335 --> 01:59.945
and Creamcheese
can get on the same page,

01:59.989 --> 02:01.512
they might actually
become a tough team to beat.

02:53.608 --> 02:55.436

02:55.479 --> 02:58.178

The flashy rookie Organizm has

02:58.221 --> 03:01.703
been turning heads despite some
questionable decision-making.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.835
But I hope he doesn't lose
that aggressiveness.

03:03.879 --> 03:05.446
And Creamcheese is able
to work with him.

03:05.489 --> 03:07.230
And level them up,
maybe they'll find a rhythm.

03:07.274 --> 03:10.277
So, how are the Golden
Guardians-- they any good?

03:10.320 --> 03:12.801
They're usually good, but it's
been a rough year for them.

03:14.498 --> 03:16.587

03:16.631 --> 03:19.068

03:19.111 --> 03:21.549
But of course the only way
pick and ban works

is if the players are
on board with the picks.

08:32.599 --> 08:34.209
APRIL:
Our tiny apartment

08:34.252 --> 08:36.124
became... gamer barracks.

08:36.167 --> 08:37.647
CREAMCHEESE:
I was sleeping on the couch.

08:37.691 --> 08:38.822
There were bunk beds.

08:38.866 --> 08:40.607
There was an air mattress.

08:40.650 --> 08:41.956
Everyone was sleeping
in the same room.

08:41.999 --> 08:43.392
-Come on, baby.
-Fuck out of here.

08:43.435 --> 08:45.046
-You want a little kiss?
-It was tough.

08:45.089 --> 08:47.048
I mean, the space was
definitely tight for six people.

08:47.091 --> 08:49.137
But you just get used to
everyone's masturbation schedule

08:49.180 --> 08:50.442
and we made it work.

08:50.486 --> 08:51.618
APRIL:
It was disgusting.

08:51.661 --> 08:53.228
But it was also...

08:53.271 --> 08:55.447
grassroots, authentic.

08:55.491 --> 08:57.406
My friends from college
were working 9:00 to 5:00.

08:57.449 --> 08:58.755
I was doing something crazy.

08:58.799 --> 09:01.105

April! April! April!

09:01.149 --> 09:02.585

09:02.629 --> 09:04.239
KYLE:
We were crazy. We were fun.

09:04.282 --> 09:06.633
We were all, you know--
We were nuts.

09:06.676 --> 09:09.244
Creamcheese went by Nutmilk.
[chuckles] You know?

09:09.287 --> 09:12.682
FRUGGER:
The guy used to call himself
Nutmilk.

09:12.726 --> 09:15.206
[giggles, coughs]
I've heard it a billion times,

09:15.250 --> 09:17.252
and it still sounds like I'm
hearing it for the first time.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.950
I was Nutmilk, wasn't I?
When I started playing.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.778
OTHERS:
Nutmilk! Nutmilk! Nutmilk!

09:21.822 --> 09:23.475
CREAMCHEESE: But the league
made me change that,

09:23.519 --> 09:25.129
actually, when I went pro,
which is...

09:25.173 --> 09:27.610
I... I honestly don't know why.

09:27.654 --> 09:28.611
I think...

09:28.655 --> 09:30.091
I mean, I think-- What I--

09:30.134 --> 09:31.962
If I had to guess,
what I think is--

09:32.006 --> 09:33.877
I think that they thought
I was talking about...

09:33.921 --> 09:35.575
one type of milk

09:35.618 --> 09:38.578
that comes from one type of nut,
you know?

09:38.621 --> 09:40.188
But I wasn't. I really wasn't.

09:40.231 --> 09:43.234
I was talking about just, um...

09:43.278 --> 09:45.149
dairy-free, organic milk.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.281
Nut milk.

09:46.324 --> 09:47.412
Almond milk, for example.

09:47.456 --> 09:49.197
Cashew milk. Hemp milk.

09:49.240 --> 09:51.199
I don't know if hemp actually--

09:51.242 --> 09:53.070
Now that I think about it,
I don't know if hemp is a nut.

09:53.114 --> 09:55.072
I don't know
what hemp is exactly,

09:55.116 --> 09:56.639
but it probably is a nut.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.337
Right?
And it's definitely a milk.

09:59.381 --> 10:00.643
[laughs]

10:00.687 --> 10:02.427
It's definitely a milk.
[chuckles]

10:02.471 --> 10:04.212
But the names and shit,

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
that's the small stuff.

10:05.953 --> 10:08.042
Like, we were playing
like fucking monsters.

10:08.085 --> 10:09.652
And no matter
what they threw at us,

10:09.696 --> 10:11.436
whatever corporate bullshit
they, like,

10:11.480 --> 10:12.829
put in our face,

10:12.873 --> 10:15.223
we were still the animals
we always were,

10:15.266 --> 10:17.268
Nutmilk or not.

10:17.312 --> 10:18.966
ORGANIZM:
I mean, they started it
all by themselves.

10:19.009 --> 10:21.446
No fancy training facility.

10:21.490 --> 10:23.884
Just them and the game.
That's all I had.

10:23.927 --> 10:26.103
So it made me feel like
I could do that, too.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.105
[quietly]: Okay, so Braxton
wanted to thank our friends

10:28.149 --> 10:30.238

ORGANIZM: I didn't know
these guys, but...

10:48.735 --> 10:50.737
they made me feel like...

10:50.780 --> 10:52.390
we were really friends
or something.

10:52.434 --> 10:53.783
Uh-oh! Uh-oh!

10:53.827 --> 10:55.350
Look at that. I'm in your lane.

10:57.221 --> 10:58.745
SIMONE:
The more he watched
people play the game,

10:58.788 --> 11:00.964
the more serious he got
about playing it.

11:01.008 --> 11:02.792
I remember, um...

11:02.836 --> 11:04.707
he asked us to get him

11:04.751 --> 11:06.187
-a new computer.
-Mm-hmm.

11:06.230 --> 11:08.232
Um, and he had
a perfectly good computer.

11:08.276 --> 11:10.800
I mean, the computer
he was using worked fine.

11:10.844 --> 11:12.933
Um, and I saw
the cost of that computer

11:12.976 --> 11:14.238
and I said no.

11:14.282 --> 11:16.501
When it came to...

11:16.545 --> 11:19.113
you know, trying to get
a new graphics card

11:19.156 --> 11:21.593
or a new processor
or a motherboard,

11:21.637 --> 11:24.205
you know, that's where
I really put all my energy.

11:24.248 --> 11:26.294
Like, I'll mow your damn lawn.

11:26.337 --> 11:28.470
-I'll shovel the snow.
-RUDY: Remember he pulled

11:28.513 --> 11:30.864
-that-that rat ou-out
of Miss Renee's crawl space.
-Mm.

11:30.907 --> 11:32.953
It was so nasty.

11:32.996 --> 11:35.259
-Just for... ten dollars.
-For a tenner. [laughs] Yeah.

11:35.303 --> 11:38.480
RUDY JR.:
He built his own computer, like,

11:38.523 --> 11:41.875
-with his own hands.
-ORGANIZM:
I got a refurbished GTX 770,

11:41.918 --> 11:44.225

about $400.

KYLE:
What you got to remember is,
he was playing for years

11:47.271 --> 11:49.230
on a computer
that only gave him,

11:49.273 --> 11:51.275

It wasn't the greatest, but...

11:58.500 --> 12:01.677
it was enough for me
to beat Guru.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.858
You know who I've got my eyes
on? Guru.

12:08.902 --> 12:10.947
-Guru.
-Don't even get me started
on Guru.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.471
Guru, oh!

12:13.515 --> 12:17.432
CHRIS:
By 2019, 2020,
Guru at this point

12:17.475 --> 12:20.652
had long since left Fugitive
to become a full-time streamer.

12:20.696 --> 12:24.265
And we had all just seen him
absolutely blow up.

12:24.308 --> 12:27.964
Why not start the day
with a win? Neverlost.

12:28.008 --> 12:29.574
FRUGGER: Not only did he get
60K-plus viewers

12:29.618 --> 12:31.315
every time he streamed,

12:31.359 --> 12:32.664
he would solo-queue against
some pretty heavy hitters,

12:32.708 --> 12:34.797
and he would always
destroy them.

12:34.841 --> 12:37.582
The showboating is whatever,
but his talent,

12:37.626 --> 12:38.714
you got to respect it.

12:38.758 --> 12:40.063
Guru coming at you.

12:40.107 --> 12:42.805
Guru knows where
your mom lives.

I need her most.

I-I know exactly what's
happening. She's cheating.

13:05.306 --> 13:06.524
She has two phones.

He was on the cover

13:07.656 --> 13:10.006
ofPC Mag's body issue.

13:10.050 --> 13:14.054
Guru was one of the first people
to understand

13:14.097 --> 13:17.013
that it was good to have fans

13:17.057 --> 13:19.624
but even better to have
people that hate you.

13:19.668 --> 13:21.496
APRIL:
He was a must-watch streamer.

13:21.539 --> 13:23.193
And then, all of a sudden,

13:23.237 --> 13:27.023
this unknown ADC named Organizm
comes out of nowhere

13:27.067 --> 13:28.808
and starts going
head-to-head with him.

13:40.080 --> 13:41.385

wasn't even close.

13:41.429 --> 13:43.039
Organizm destroyed him.

this is purely a pro player

on a smurf account
just trolling Guru.

13:54.224 --> 13:56.400
And somehow they face off
for a second time,

14:06.976 --> 14:09.065
who-who the fuck
this Organizm kid was.

14:09.109 --> 14:10.850
So, here's-here's what you need
to understand, is that

14:10.893 --> 14:15.550
at this time Org had beat
better players than Guru.

14:15.593 --> 14:20.076
But none were as popular
and as public as Guru.

Organizm, for the third time,

14:30.957 --> 14:35.135
bests Guru on stream
in front of everyone.

14:35.178 --> 14:37.659
And the biggest reason
it was getting under his skin

14:37.702 --> 14:39.400
is because this kid
refused to talk.

that would become
absolutely legend.

Organizm came out of nowhere,

16:46.222 --> 16:49.269
and no one really knew
anything about him.

16:49.312 --> 16:51.010
I think that there were a lot
of rumors that it was

16:51.053 --> 16:53.577
different players
using a pseudo-name

16:53.621 --> 16:54.665
climbing up the ladder.

16:56.711 --> 16:59.409
EMMA:
Was it Tinky using
a smurf account?

16:59.453 --> 17:01.324
Everyone was wondering
who it was.

17:01.368 --> 17:05.111
KYLE: And then to find out
that the person that did it

17:05.154 --> 17:09.202
was some 16-year-old
in his basement

17:09.245 --> 17:12.379
playing on a fax machine?
Come on.

17:19.516 --> 17:22.519
Just that.
It was accurate.

17:22.563 --> 17:23.955
EMMA:
It got to the point
that Organizm was

17:23.999 --> 17:25.740
a much-watched streamer.

17:25.783 --> 17:28.177
Now he's got a camera,
now he's got an audience.

17:28.221 --> 17:30.745
Everybody needed to see the kid
who slayed Guru.

17:32.268 --> 17:34.749
JATT:
He used this to kind of
kickstart his streaming career.

17:34.792 --> 17:37.099
And he was totally different
than a Guru stream.

17:37.143 --> 17:40.189
A Guru stream is loud,
It's obnoxious.

17:40.233 --> 17:45.064
Here we go.
First blood goes to Guru!

17:45.107 --> 17:46.848
I put you in a body cast.

17:46.891 --> 17:49.590
Organizm stream is all business.

17:49.633 --> 17:54.812
He's like the Kawhi Leonard
of esports.

17:54.856 --> 17:56.640
And there's an audience
for that.

17:56.684 --> 17:59.121
Got him.

17:59.165 --> 18:01.123
By this point, all of the pro
teams had heard of him,

18:01.167 --> 18:03.038
and the offers started
coming his way.

18:03.082 --> 18:04.866
CHRIS:
Yeah, the offers were hot,

18:04.909 --> 18:07.608
but the thing you got
to understand about Organizm

18:07.651 --> 18:09.740
is that he really only had eyes
for one team.

18:09.784 --> 18:12.178
He wanted to play with Fugitive.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.831
ORGANIZM:
Deciding was easy.

18:13.875 --> 18:16.138
Join my favorite team
and win us a championship.

18:16.182 --> 18:18.184
CREAMCHEESE:
Honestly, when I first heard
we were gonna sign Org,

18:18.227 --> 18:19.750
I was, like, pretty stoked.

18:19.794 --> 18:21.752
The kid was a fucking hero.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.233
ADC of the future.
What's up, dude?

18:25.800 --> 18:28.629
"It's okay, I still think
you're a good player."

18:28.672 --> 18:31.153
FRUGGER:
It was so cool.
It was so dope.

18:31.197 --> 18:35.592
And... yeah, and then, you know,
I mean, and then he, uh...

18:35.636 --> 18:37.072
and then he took my job.

18:37.116 --> 18:39.161
JATT:
It all happened so quick,

18:39.205 --> 18:40.815
and so we were all
left wondering

18:40.858 --> 18:43.034
if this big bet on a kid

18:43.078 --> 18:45.124
with absolutely
no team experience

18:45.167 --> 18:46.777
would pan out,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.997
or would it be
a colossal failure?

18:57.962 --> 19:01.401
Heimerdinger?!
Are you fucking kidding?

19:01.444 --> 19:03.664
APRIL:
So, Organizm picks Heimerdinger,

19:03.707 --> 19:06.406
which is a fine pick
in solo queue.

19:06.449 --> 19:09.322
But this is the pro stage,
and Heimerdinger hasn't

19:09.365 --> 19:11.280
been picked in pro play
since 2018.

19:11.324 --> 19:14.631
To say it was a bold choice
is a vast

19:14.675 --> 19:15.937
understatement.

19:15.980 --> 19:19.070
[players muttering]

19:19.114 --> 19:20.811
We're fucking losing.

19:20.855 --> 19:22.161
ANNOUNCER: And Fugitive
is picking up a 4v5

19:22.204 --> 19:23.988
at blue buff without Organizm!

19:24.032 --> 19:25.947
It's gonna be hard to win.
Already a kick-flash on the bot.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.470
Fugitive are screwed
in this battle.

19:27.514 --> 19:29.646
Basically 3v5
for the first kill.

19:29.690 --> 19:32.214
Creamcheese able
to trade one back,

19:32.258 --> 19:33.302
but there's
no reinforcements coming.

19:33.346 --> 19:35.478
He's going for the mid wave.

19:35.522 --> 19:37.785
This is gonna be a slaughter.
Fugitive are down.

19:37.828 --> 19:39.830
So that game was
a really sloppy game

19:39.874 --> 19:41.789
between two teams
at the bottom of the standings.

19:41.832 --> 19:43.617
And you could just tell
that Fugitive

19:43.660 --> 19:45.314
were not on the same page.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.403
All right, Buckets, it's been
a 4v5 since level one.

19:47.447 --> 19:49.710
ANNOUNCER:
Here comes Storm Grenade.
Stuns two...

19:49.753 --> 19:52.626
JATT: If this was TSM, they'd
punish Org for that Heimer pick,

19:52.669 --> 19:53.975
and Fugitive gets blown out.

19:54.018 --> 19:55.498
But against Golden Guardians,

19:55.542 --> 19:57.283
Organizm's donger was sublime.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.894
ANNOUNCER: Organizm walks up
into a one versus five.

19:59.937 --> 20:01.635
He has already killed three.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.158
He's gonna get the fourth.
Leona's gonna fall.

20:03.202 --> 20:05.943
Enough of the zone.
His Ori's out!

20:06.901 --> 20:09.251
This is so fucking...
Fuck this.

20:09.295 --> 20:11.253
This is so fucking dumb.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.081
ANNOUNCER:
Creamcheese is walking
off the stage.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.474
The game's not even over yet.

20:14.517 --> 20:16.258
I can't believe
what we're seeing.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.434
After securing the victory,

20:18.478 --> 20:20.262
what a terrible display
of sportsmanship.

20:22.917 --> 20:24.875
To see the team, like,
winning the game,

20:24.919 --> 20:27.138
and then Creamcheese
just gets up before

20:27.182 --> 20:28.444
the Nexus has exploded...

20:30.229 --> 20:32.622
Like, the amount
of disrespect there

20:32.666 --> 20:34.276
was immeasurable.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.235
-Where did he go, though?
-Yeah, where's Cream?

20:36.278 --> 20:37.279
[phone line ringing]

20:40.239 --> 20:43.285
-FORESITE: When you're
a veteran and you're a leader...
-Fucking shit...

20:43.329 --> 20:44.765
You know, it's, um...

20:44.808 --> 20:47.115
That's just something
that you can't do.

20:47.158 --> 20:49.509
And, you know,
it's heartbreaking to see him

20:49.552 --> 20:50.814
walk off that stage because

20:50.858 --> 20:52.816
I know that he's
better than that.

20:52.860 --> 20:53.991
[indistinct chatter]

20:54.035 --> 20:55.384
FRUGGER:
Bro, I would've done--

20:55.428 --> 20:56.907
I would've done
the exact same thing.

20:56.951 --> 20:58.953
Hey, hey, what are you doing?

21:00.824 --> 21:03.262
Hey, uh, it's Creamcheese.
I'm just calling to tell you

21:03.305 --> 21:04.480
that you're fucking this team

21:04.524 --> 21:05.916
by making us start that kid.

21:05.960 --> 21:08.745
Okay?

21:08.789 --> 21:10.834
Yeah, because I cleaned up
his mess,

21:10.878 --> 21:12.314
which is your mess,
by the way.

21:14.185 --> 21:16.057
No, it's not just "still a win."

21:16.100 --> 21:17.972
We should have destroyed
that team.

21:21.367 --> 21:23.107
I do not trust you.

21:23.151 --> 21:24.544
Honestly, all you care about
is money. It's so obvious.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.197
The only reason that
you're starting this kid

21:26.241 --> 21:27.329
is because you think
he'd look good in a fucking

21:27.373 --> 21:29.549
Totino's Pizza Roll commercial.

21:31.899 --> 21:34.118
Okay, so... Okay.

21:34.162 --> 21:35.337
So you do want...

21:35.381 --> 21:36.425
I could be in a Totino's
commercial

21:36.469 --> 21:37.992
within the fucking hour.

21:38.035 --> 21:41.343
Radio, television, a billboard.

21:43.650 --> 21:45.434
Oh, my God. Fuck you!

21:45.478 --> 21:47.654
Fuck you, bro!
Fuck you, Resnick.

21:47.697 --> 21:50.134
Get off of me.
Fucking shit!

21:50.178 --> 21:52.093
-Ow! Fuck.
-Dude, are you okay?

21:52.136 --> 21:54.313
-Ow. Fuck. Oh, shit.
-Are you all right?

21:54.356 --> 21:56.184
-I hit a stud. No, I definitely
fucking hit a stud.
-Out. Let's go.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.838
Let's go. Out. Out!

21:57.881 --> 21:59.492
I just fucking hurt my hand.
I need to see a medic.

21:59.535 --> 22:01.537
Well, find one outside.

22:10.677 --> 22:13.375
Listen, bro, you're chill,
but if you ever want him

22:13.419 --> 22:14.898
to love you like he loves me,

22:14.942 --> 22:17.684
you don't go fucking picking
Heimerdinger.

22:22.297 --> 22:24.038
I don't see why
you're defending him.

22:24.081 --> 22:25.474
I'm not defending him.

22:25.518 --> 22:26.910
But isn't this our team?

22:26.954 --> 22:28.999
Like, didn't we create Fugitive?

22:29.043 --> 22:33.003
Cream, Fugitive is not
our team anymore.

22:33.047 --> 22:34.309
Don't put that on me.

22:34.353 --> 22:35.789
I'm not putting that on you.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.660
That's not on anyone.
That's just a fact.

22:37.704 --> 22:39.923
Oh, my God, is this
all my blood here?

22:39.967 --> 22:44.275
-Fuck, ow, it really hurts.
-Put some pressure on it.

22:44.319 --> 22:46.234
Look, I-I'm not blaming
anyone here.

22:46.277 --> 22:48.715
Ow, I really think
I fucked up my hand, honestly.

22:48.758 --> 22:51.065
We got to just deal with
what we can deal with. You know?

22:51.108 --> 22:52.849
Y-You've played
with rookies before.

22:52.893 --> 22:56.810
Is Org, uh, you know,
any worse than Spaghetti?

22:56.853 --> 23:00.596
No. Spaghetti's fucking
terrible.

23:00.640 --> 23:03.425
Right?

23:03.469 --> 23:05.427
A-Actually, you know what?

23:05.471 --> 23:07.603
Like, honestly, I would...

23:07.647 --> 23:09.562
I would rather play
with Spaghetti.

23:09.605 --> 23:12.129
-You'd rather play
with Spaghetti?
-Yeah, I would fucking...

23:12.173 --> 23:13.609
I would rather play
with Spaghetti,

23:13.653 --> 23:14.958
-now that I think about it.
-With Spaghetti?!

23:15.002 --> 23:17.483
-Yeah, he was a-a bad laner.
-Yeah.

23:17.526 --> 23:19.572
But he was a fucking good guy,
and he listened.

23:19.615 --> 23:21.443
We almost went to Worlds
with Spaghetti.

23:21.487 --> 23:23.750
It was a different--
It was a team.

23:23.793 --> 23:26.579
I can fucking do that.

23:26.622 --> 23:29.451
It's not like that with Org.
I can't play with him.

23:29.495 --> 23:31.584
We deal with what
we can control.

23:31.627 --> 23:34.325
-And we can-- you can control
how you play.
-No, you're right.

23:34.369 --> 23:35.805
That's good. You're right.

23:35.849 --> 23:38.155
I can, I can only deal
with what I can control.

23:38.199 --> 23:41.245
JATT:
The AD Carry and support
position

23:41.289 --> 23:43.552
have to be just
incredibly in sync.

23:43.596 --> 23:46.599
It's like a quarterback
and a wide receiver

23:46.642 --> 23:48.427
running an option route.

23:48.470 --> 23:51.908
If either one of them
sees the play differently,

23:51.952 --> 23:53.649
it's disastrous.

23:53.693 --> 23:55.738
They both have to make
the same read in the same moment

23:55.782 --> 23:58.480
in order for the play to work.
And I feel like

23:58.524 --> 24:00.351
the AD Carry and support
are very similar.

24:00.395 --> 24:03.354
You kind of just have to know
when the moment to go in is,

24:03.398 --> 24:05.139
and then they both do it
at the same time.

24:10.274 --> 24:13.495
[actress speaking
foreign language]

24:13.539 --> 24:15.715
BGOLBKTOFWTR:
And don't even get me started
about the fact that

24:15.758 --> 24:18.108
I didn't hear a single thing
from him the entire game.

24:18.152 --> 24:19.588
NIGHTFALL:
I don't know. Organizm...

24:19.632 --> 24:21.460
BAP: He didn't use a ping
when he play solo queue.

24:21.503 --> 24:23.636
-That-that still triggers me,
like...
-[laughter]

24:23.679 --> 24:26.552
What are you doing? You're doing
fucking competition game,

24:26.595 --> 24:29.032
and you're not even using ping.

24:30.730 --> 24:32.688
[girl laughing]

24:32.732 --> 24:36.170
I gotcha. I gotcha. I gotcha.

24:36.213 --> 24:38.520
-Can you say "ulti"?
-Ulti.

24:38.564 --> 24:40.653
-Ulti.
-Yeah. That's right.
-Yeah.

24:40.696 --> 24:42.350
-They got the buff.
-They did.

24:42.393 --> 24:43.873
They got the buff.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.746
Look, I mean, obviously
I'd rather start Frugger

24:46.789 --> 24:49.749
and have Org refine his skills
in Academy,

24:49.792 --> 24:52.534
but it's not my call, is it?

24:52.578 --> 24:55.145
You and Cream have been through
thick and thin, baby.

24:55.189 --> 24:57.974
-It's gonna be fine.
-Hey, see this jersey?

24:58.018 --> 25:00.455
-Yeah.
-I'm never wearing it again.

25:00.499 --> 25:02.109
What are you talking about?

25:02.152 --> 25:04.024
I'm demanding a trade.

25:07.767 --> 25:09.595
Frugger.

25:18.299 --> 25:19.953
Oh, my God.

25:21.345 --> 25:23.173
-You ready for this?
-Yeah.

25:23.217 --> 25:27.351
-Where's the switch?
-It's on the other side.
Right there.

25:27.395 --> 25:29.049
-Do you have a lighter?
-Do I have a li--

25:29.092 --> 25:30.833
-It's not turning on, dude.
-No, you need a lighter.

25:30.877 --> 25:32.748
-Just hold on.
-No, it's just, you turn this

25:32.792 --> 25:33.923
-and it's supposed to light.
-Hold on. Hold on.

25:33.967 --> 25:35.795
There's a button.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.318
-You twisted it too many times.
-I twisted it. It's broken.

25:37.361 --> 25:38.754
All right, well, back up.
I don't want to burn

25:38.798 --> 25:40.321
-my eyebrows off.
-Obvi it wouldn't turn on.

25:40.364 --> 25:41.496
You're not gonna burn yourself,
it's broken.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.106
I burned my eyebrows off
one time.

25:43.150 --> 25:44.107
It took eight months
to grow back. Just hold on.

25:45.500 --> 25:48.459
-Oh. Whoa, dude.
-Oh! Got it.

25:48.503 --> 25:49.765
-That was sick.
-I told you, dude.

25:49.809 --> 25:51.071
Dude, that was
fucking sick, bro.

25:51.114 --> 25:52.594
I told you.
You just need a lighter.

25:52.638 --> 25:54.248
Okay.

25:54.291 --> 25:56.642
-I can't believe
you fixed that.
-Yeah.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.165
Dude...

26:00.123 --> 26:03.431
-Okay, we should do this, right?
-You gonna do it? Do it.

26:03.474 --> 26:04.911
Fuck, dude.
