I was happy to walk away
and never see you again.

03:02.443 --> 03:04.009
But you didn't let me.

03:04.009 --> 03:06.838
You kissed me, and--
and you told me you were sorry

03:06.838 --> 03:08.449

to see me again.

03:36.346 --> 03:38.479
It's everything from
our first night together.

03:38.479 --> 03:41.308
It's the same lingerie,
the same lavender flowers.

03:41.308 --> 03:43.701
It's...

03:43.701 --> 03:45.747
I love you.

03:45.747 --> 03:47.401

we're going through,

03:47.401 --> 03:48.489
we'll get
through it together

03:48.489 --> 03:50.708

03:50.708 --> 03:53.320

want to lose it.

03:53.320 --> 03:54.756

What's up, ladies?

04:34.099 --> 04:36.319
It's your girl Vic,
uh, Hughes.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.191
Um, I'm just inviting you all
to join our girls' fire camp

04:39.191 --> 04:40.497
where you to learn
life-saving tips

04:40.497 --> 04:43.326
and moves from the women
of Seattle FD.

04:43.326 --> 04:45.372
Uh, it's gonna be fun.
We're gonna be out in the park,

04:45.372 --> 04:49.463
just running around,
we're playing catch.

04:49.463 --> 04:51.421
We're not playing catch.
Why-- That's--

04:51.421 --> 04:53.162
Did you start talking
to the girls like puppies again?

04:53.162 --> 04:54.816
Why am I
so bad at this?

04:54.816 --> 04:56.470
Nah, I wouldn't
say bad, but... Well...

04:56.470 --> 04:58.559
...maybe stop
- offering them treats.
- Ugh.

04:58.559 --> 05:00.038
What are you up to?

05:00.038 --> 05:02.476
Oh, you know, checking
smoke detectors,

05:02.476 --> 05:04.260
sprinklers.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.175
- Oh.
- Usual inspection stuff.

05:06.175 --> 05:07.611
Look at you,
staying on top of things.

05:07.611 --> 05:09.613
Yeah, well, we sure don't
have a captain who is.

05:09.613 --> 05:12.616
Okay. Um, do you need
any help at all?

05:12.616 --> 05:14.488
No. You have enough
going on today.

05:14.488 --> 05:16.925
Don't you have to meet Travis
about his union thing later?

05:16.925 --> 05:18.927
Oh, God. See, you having to
remind me of that

05:18.927 --> 05:21.364
is probably not
a good sign, right?

05:21.364 --> 05:22.713
Thank you.

05:27.457 --> 05:30.068
Whoa!
It's a whole feast.

05:30.068 --> 05:31.418
What, did somebody
lose a bet?

05:31.418 --> 05:32.941
I'm not sure what
got into Bishop,

05:32.941 --> 05:34.464
but we need to bottle it.

05:34.464 --> 05:36.379
I'm going for seconds,
but if I were you,

05:36.379 --> 05:38.381
I'd make a plate before Ruiz
or Hughes come walking in.

05:38.381 --> 05:39.817
Ooh, that's
a fair point.

05:39.817 --> 05:41.515
Today's a clinic day,
and this might be my last chance

05:41.515 --> 05:43.430
at a good meal.

05:43.430 --> 05:46.520
So, it looks like a couple
of days off served you well.

05:46.520 --> 05:50.175
I enjoyed my time off, yes.

05:50.175 --> 05:52.177
- Hey, Bishop.
- Yes, sir?

05:52.177 --> 05:53.744
Nice breakfast.

05:53.744 --> 05:58.532
Thank you for being such a--
an asset to your team.

06:01.448 --> 06:03.580
Who was that?

06:03.580 --> 06:06.583
That may be the first time
I could use the word "casual"

06:06.583 --> 06:10.195
to describe Beckett without
adding the word "misogyny."

06:10.195 --> 06:12.589
This bacon is so good.
You should try it.

06:12.589 --> 06:15.331
I like my smoothies.

06:15.331 --> 06:18.116
In the mornings
and at night.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.336
I mean, what if you just
make yourself a plate

06:20.336 --> 06:21.555
and then throw it
in the blender?

06:21.555 --> 06:23.208
Sounds good.

06:25.341 --> 06:28.562
No.
No, no, no!

06:28.562 --> 06:30.215
Oh, my gosh.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.827
"Travis Montgomery was arrested
for public intoxication

06:32.827 --> 06:36.483
and the assault
of a fellow firefighter."

06:36.483 --> 06:38.659
Oh. That is low.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.008
I mean, that is low
even for Dixon.

06:40.008 --> 06:41.575
Is it?
Because ruining my life

06:41.575 --> 06:43.794
before breakfast
seems pretty on brand.

06:43.794 --> 06:45.361
I can fix this!
I can fix this.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.449
Where is he?
I can fix this.

06:46.449 --> 06:47.711
Hey, Travis,
Travis, I got this.

06:47.711 --> 06:49.452
- We got this, okay?
- Okay, great.

06:49.452 --> 06:51.585
You have a contingency plan
for this kind of situation?

06:51.585 --> 06:53.587
Vic? Please tell me
there's any kind of plan.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.502
Okay. Okay.
So we're gonna, um...

06:55.502 --> 06:58.722
I think we should make
a video statement, and then...

06:58.722 --> 07:00.507
we're gonna do
a-a press conference.

07:00.507 --> 07:02.247
I think we should just be honest
about it, okay?

07:02.247 --> 07:04.336
That drags my name
through the mud

07:04.336 --> 07:05.947
as well as
the entire FD.

07:05.947 --> 07:08.253
We're lucky that it didn't
include you, too.

07:08.253 --> 07:11.082
And this drops right before
I have to meet the Union Board?

07:11.082 --> 07:13.955
We should've seen
this coming.

07:13.955 --> 07:16.653
How did we not
see this coming?

07:57.868 --> 07:59.653
Mm. Okay, I--

07:59.653 --> 08:02.307
I went on a date with
a massage therapist last night.

08:02.307 --> 08:03.874
Because you
need a massage?

08:03.874 --> 08:05.659

a massage.

08:05.659 --> 08:08.662
I mean, I-- I hinted at it
all night, and finally--

08:08.662 --> 08:09.663
He tells you what
he charges.

08:09.663 --> 08:11.578
Yeah, 140 bucks an hour!140 bucks?!

08:11.578 --> 08:13.580
Can you believe that?
Right! So-- So--

08:13.580 --> 08:15.320
Well, you need to break up
with this dude.

08:15.320 --> 08:18.585
So, what I learned is,
if I want a massage,

08:18.585 --> 08:20.587
- I need to book a massage.
- Yeah.

08:20.587 --> 08:24.591
Okay. All I'm saying is,
if you really like this lady

08:24.591 --> 08:26.462
and you want more,
you should tell her.

08:26.462 --> 08:28.725
You--
Ask for what you want.

08:28.725 --> 08:31.902
Yeah, well, that's...

08:31.902 --> 08:33.338
good advice.

08:33.338 --> 08:34.949
And you've been
stepping it up, too.

Crisis One volunteer.

09:17.426 --> 09:18.993
This is Raphael.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.386
We got a report from staff
saying that he was pacing

09:21.386 --> 09:23.693
and yelling
and talking to himself.

09:23.693 --> 09:25.695
He's calmed down a bit,

10:51.912 --> 10:53.522
- Hey, good morning, Ben.
- Hey.

10:53.522 --> 10:56.699
Hey, Grey-Sloan came through
with a donation of gloves.

10:56.699 --> 10:58.875
Oh, good. Did any of
the saline bags come in?

10:58.875 --> 11:01.051
Yeah, we'll just have
to make do today.

11:01.051 --> 11:03.053
Okay.

11:03.053 --> 11:05.055
Is Jack Gibson
volunteering today?

11:05.055 --> 11:06.840
Yeah. Sure,
let's call it that.

11:06.840 --> 11:08.276
Okay, good.

11:08.276 --> 11:11.192
Because I got us
some volunteers, too.

11:11.192 --> 11:12.759
Do you remember
Peggy and Dayna?

11:12.759 --> 11:15.196
Peggy was my patient, and--And Dayna's her wife, yeah.

11:15.196 --> 11:17.067
Yeah.
I remember how
accident-prone they are.

11:17.067 --> 11:19.504
Gonna have to put cones
around their table.

11:19.504 --> 11:21.071
Okay, they are my friends,
and they're wonderful,

11:21.071 --> 11:22.420
and they really
want to help.

11:22.420 --> 11:23.944
Yeah, cones
and yellow caution tape.

11:23.944 --> 11:24.988
Stop it.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.338
Yeah, and don't let them
bake anything.

11:33.214 --> 11:35.390
You have enough there?5, 6, 7, 8, 9...

11:35.390 --> 11:37.609
Hi! Welcome to
the Station 19 Clinic.

11:37.609 --> 11:39.742
It's the Dean Miller
Memorial Clinic.

11:39.742 --> 11:42.179
Is it?
Babe, there is
a ginormous sign

11:42.179 --> 11:44.225
that is screaming it
behind you.

11:44.225 --> 11:45.661
Oh. Sorry.
First-day jitters.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.576
Um, how can we help you?

11:47.576 --> 11:49.621
Let me guess--
it's your wrist.

11:49.621 --> 11:51.232
Ooh. Ouch!
What happened?

11:51.232 --> 11:52.929
Didn't you used
to work here?

11:52.929 --> 11:54.888
Sorry, uh,
doctor-patient confidentiality.

11:54.888 --> 11:57.455
- Uh, I get it.
- Fill out these forms,

11:57.455 --> 12:01.459
and then you will be seen
in the order that you arrived.

12:01.459 --> 12:04.027
And there might be a wait. Sorry.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.942
No, I-I'm-- I'm sorry.
W-What the hell?

12:05.942 --> 12:08.118
T-This clinic
doesn't h-have forms.

12:08.118 --> 12:10.730
Uh, it does,
according to Dr. Warren.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.428
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

12:13.428 --> 12:14.864
- Sorry.
- Do you think I should

12:14.864 --> 12:15.996
- help him fill out those forms?
- Maybe.

12:15.996 --> 12:17.606
I can write
faster than him.

12:21.088 --> 12:23.264
Montgomery, thank you for
helping with the clinic today.

12:23.264 --> 12:26.789
Okay, what's-- what's going on
with you today, Captain?

12:26.789 --> 12:29.792
Please, just-- What stage
of mind games is this?

12:29.792 --> 12:31.489
It's because
I'm here today.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.230
- Chief.
- Yeah.

12:33.230 --> 12:34.666
Montgomery,
drop those off.

12:34.666 --> 12:36.233
Come see me in
the conference room, please.

12:36.233 --> 12:38.192
This is just a perfect day.

12:45.852 --> 12:47.592
Chief, I'm very sorry.

12:47.592 --> 12:50.813
I know you are very busy and
you don't need any of my mess,

12:50.813 --> 12:53.250
and you don't need
any more managerial crap.

12:53.250 --> 12:55.296
Montgomery, I'm here
'cause today's the day

12:55.296 --> 12:56.819
that I start
my new pilot program

12:56.819 --> 12:59.082
where I rotate stations
to monitor

12:59.082 --> 13:00.692
their units
reporting to incidents.

13:00.692 --> 13:03.086
It's just a coincidence
that I'm starting out

13:03.086 --> 13:04.871
in the same house
as a local celebrity.

13:04.871 --> 13:07.047
Right, and I-- I-I'm--
I'm gonna make things right.

13:07.047 --> 13:10.093
I've already started
strategizing about
a publicly apologize--

13:10.093 --> 13:11.703
I don't care.

13:11.703 --> 13:14.619
- I-I'm sorry?
- Montgomery, this is politics.

13:14.619 --> 13:16.186
You're not gonna walk away
with your hands clean.

13:16.186 --> 13:18.536
Do you know how much mud
I get slung at me every day?

13:18.536 --> 13:19.842
No, ma'am.

13:19.842 --> 13:21.017
More than
what should be allowed.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.889
I have to keep a composure
that is pristine

13:22.889 --> 13:26.066
so that that mud
slides right off.

13:26.066 --> 13:29.765
You and I both know from the
backgrounds that we have that

13:29.765 --> 13:31.506
to be half of anything is
never enough.

13:31.506 --> 13:33.116
You got to be double.

13:33.116 --> 13:35.858
That's right.

13:35.858 --> 13:38.556
Now, you are
an exceptional firefighter.

13:38.556 --> 13:41.124
But you are still only half
a mayoral candidate.

13:41.124 --> 13:43.692
You want to beat Dixon,
you cannot hide.

13:43.692 --> 13:45.912
You cannot
let the mud stick.

13:45.912 --> 13:49.002
You gotta throw
some of your own.

13:49.002 --> 13:50.699
Or you find someone
to do it for you.

13:50.699 --> 13:53.223
<i>Ladder 19 on scene,</i>

13:53.223 --> 13:55.008
<i>Arkine battery recycling plant,</i>

13:55.008 --> 13:57.010
<i>requesting additional resources.</i>

13:57.010 --> 14:00.013
Hey, Raphael, let's try
and center ourselves, okay?

14:00.013 --> 14:02.798
We're gonna take
some deep breaths.

14:02.798 --> 14:04.452
If you exhale longer
than you inhale,

14:04.452 --> 14:05.888
it helps calm down
your nervous system.

14:05.888 --> 14:07.281
I don't want to take
deep breaths.

14:07.281 --> 14:09.674
Okay. That's okay.
How 'bout we talk?

14:09.674 --> 14:11.459
Do you want to talk?

14:11.459 --> 14:14.723
I, uh

14:14.723 --> 14:18.031
I used to come here all the time
with my dad.

14:18.031 --> 14:21.121
I mean, we would--
we would watch fireworks here,

14:21.121 --> 14:23.471
listen to concerts nearby.

14:23.471 --> 14:25.690
He used to call this place
the cheap seats.

14:25.690 --> 14:26.953
We would have picnics
on the car,

14:26.953 --> 14:29.869
and we had the whole place
to ourselves.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.482
C-Can you guys
leave me alone?

14:34.482 --> 14:36.614
Like, t-this is my place.

14:36.614 --> 14:38.399
It's-- It's my place.

14:38.399 --> 14:40.140
- Crisis One to SFD One.
- Leave me alone.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.969
Subject Raphael
is a potential jumper.

14:42.969 --> 14:44.840
Got the harness ready.

14:44.840 --> 14:47.016
Keep additional aid
on standby.

14:48.844 --> 14:50.933
A good campaign manager would've
seen this coming, right?

14:50.933 --> 14:53.022
I mean, every time I think
I have a grasp on this,

14:53.022 --> 14:56.025
something happens
that makes me look like a kid.

14:56.025 --> 14:58.201
You know, honestly, I've never
seen you be bad

14:58.201 --> 15:01.944
at anything you really wanted,
so is that the problem?

15:03.032 --> 15:04.555
What do you mean?

15:04.555 --> 15:06.122
Well, do you really want
to keep doing this?

15:06.122 --> 15:08.951
Travis would be devastated
if I quit now,

15:08.951 --> 15:11.171
and he really needs the help,
so I'm not gonna--No, no, I'm not asking
about Travis.

15:11.171 --> 15:13.434
I'm asking what <i>you</i> want.

15:13.434 --> 15:16.132
Okay.
Well, how about you don't?

15:16.132 --> 15:18.308
Why don't we talk about
what's going on with you?

15:18.308 --> 15:19.788
- With me?
- Yeah, I saw you check

15:19.788 --> 15:21.311
that one smoke detector
three times,

15:21.311 --> 15:23.183
and it wasn't
even beeping.

15:23.183 --> 15:26.186
Alright! Look alive back there!
We've arrived!

15:30.973 --> 15:35.673
Here! Here!

15:35.673 --> 15:38.198
- Oh, finally! Thank God!
- Did you put the call in, ma'am?

15:38.198 --> 15:39.460
Yes-- eight of my co-workers
are trapped

15:39.460 --> 15:41.157
in the smelting room!

15:41.157 --> 15:42.985
That's where they melt the
batteries down for recycling!

15:42.985 --> 15:44.378
A giant chemical
furnace room, right?

15:44.378 --> 15:46.206
Why haven't you shut
the equipment down?

15:46.206 --> 15:47.903
We can't shut it down!
The lab and the vent system

15:47.903 --> 15:49.470
are both
electronically sealed.

15:49.470 --> 15:52.125
Please, the heat and the sulfur
are only getting hotter!

15:52.125 --> 15:54.170
Alright, team, we're gonna
need forcible entry on this one!

15:54.170 --> 15:55.693
Everyone in breathers!

15:55.693 --> 15:58.348
Bring gas meters
and entry tools!

15:58.348 --> 16:01.177
Dispatch, requesting
a Hazmat unit to our location.

16:03.266 --> 16:04.572
Crisis One, this is SFD One.

16:04.572 --> 16:06.574
What's the status
of your situation?

16:06.574 --> 16:08.402
<i>SFD One,
Crisis One is on scene</i>

16:08.402 --> 16:10.230
and engaged with subject.

16:10.230 --> 16:12.058
Male, late 20s. Raphael.

16:12.058 --> 16:13.798
Showing signs
of self-harm.

16:13.798 --> 16:15.496
It seems like you have
a great relationship

16:15.496 --> 16:17.063
with your dad, Raphael.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.848
Where is he now?

16:19.848 --> 16:22.285
Um, he's with God.

16:22.285 --> 16:26.159
Yeah, that's what my Mom
says is, "He's with God."

16:26.159 --> 16:28.596
He-- He died
when I was 14.

16:28.596 --> 16:33.949
Just... dropped right
in front of me.

16:33.949 --> 16:35.385
It's-- It's crazy.

16:35.385 --> 16:38.258
I-I would--
I would shake all the time.

16:38.258 --> 16:40.173
I mean, in-- in class.

16:40.173 --> 16:42.610
And-- And, you know,
kids are the worst.

16:42.610 --> 16:45.526
But I just--
I could never stop shaking.

16:45.526 --> 16:48.268
And my mom, she would--
she would always say,

16:48.268 --> 16:51.184
"It's okay, baby.
Your Papa's with God now."

16:51.184 --> 16:53.316
Like that was supposed
to make me feel better,

16:53.316 --> 16:56.493
but I was 14!

16:56.493 --> 17:00.845
I didn't want my dad with God.
I wanted him with me!

17:00.845 --> 17:02.847
My mom faked her own death

17:02.847 --> 17:05.024
to get away from me and my dad
when I was a kid.

17:06.373 --> 17:08.766
And I'm not--
I'm not saying that to compete

17:08.766 --> 17:12.553
with your story
or to compete with your pain,

17:12.553 --> 17:15.773
but I'm--
I'm-- I'm saying I get it.

17:15.773 --> 17:18.124
I feel you, Raphael.

17:18.124 --> 17:21.214
I know what it feels like
to survive,

17:21.214 --> 17:24.347
and I sure as hell know what it
feels like to miss my dad

17:24.347 --> 17:26.262
and to want
to see him again.

17:26.262 --> 17:29.352
But I also know that
if I was sick,

17:29.352 --> 17:31.354
my dad would want me
to fight for my life, not--

17:31.354 --> 17:33.791
not get wasted at his favorite
place and throw it all away.

17:33.791 --> 17:36.794
There's nothing left
to fight for!

17:36.794 --> 17:39.232
I'm not even 35,
and I'm in heart failure

17:39.232 --> 17:41.234
'cause of the toxins
in my blood,

17:41.234 --> 17:44.193
the toxins that I was exposed to
at my job.

17:44.193 --> 17:45.194
I'm sorry--Every day!

17:45.194 --> 17:47.892
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

17:47.892 --> 17:49.981
Did your mom even--
even fake her own death?

17:49.981 --> 17:52.158
I wish I could say
I was making that up.

17:52.158 --> 17:55.378
Get back!
Everybody get back!

17:55.378 --> 17:56.988
Okay, okay!
No, no, no!

17:56.988 --> 17:59.339
Sir, it's just
a preliminary screening.

17:59.339 --> 18:01.471
Hi. Over here.

18:01.471 --> 18:04.300
Welcome to the Dean Miller
Memorial Clinic.

18:04.300 --> 18:05.736
How can we help you?

18:05.736 --> 18:09.131
Um, actually,
I'm just here to--

18:09.131 --> 18:10.828
Jack Gibson?

18:14.484 --> 18:16.269
I get dragged in here,
and then I have to wait.

18:16.269 --> 18:17.748
How rude is that?

18:17.748 --> 18:19.272
You're sitting in
a familiar place

18:19.272 --> 18:20.751
with a stable roof
over your head.

18:20.751 --> 18:23.624
Oh, what a tragedy.
Come on.

18:23.624 --> 18:25.234
Come on!

18:25.234 --> 18:26.801
Mm-hmm. Yep.

18:28.237 --> 18:29.978
He's a looker,
isn't he?

18:29.978 --> 18:31.849
He used to work here.
Mm-hmm.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.591
Sorry, um, what
can we do for you?

18:34.591 --> 18:37.203
Um, lately, I notice it burns
when I pee.

18:37.203 --> 18:39.248
Oh, yeah, been there.

18:39.248 --> 18:42.425
Um, I'm not a doctor, but if it
is what I think it is,

18:42.425 --> 18:44.166
it's not a big problem.

18:44.166 --> 18:46.777
Thank you.

18:48.039 --> 18:49.563
Can you explain why
the machines can't shut off?

18:49.563 --> 18:52.261
Our new owners digitized
all of our systems,

18:52.261 --> 18:54.220
from the ventilation
to the smelting engines

18:54.220 --> 18:56.004
to the door locks.

18:56.004 --> 18:57.745
It requires our engineer's palm
print for emergency access.

18:57.745 --> 18:59.834
- Where's your engineer?
- I don't know.

18:59.834 --> 19:02.315
He didn't show up this morning,
and I called management,

19:02.315 --> 19:04.012
and they said the process
was "basically automated"

19:04.012 --> 19:05.796
and we should do it
without him.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.320
So they threw them in
with no exit plan?

19:07.320 --> 19:10.453
I guess they think a few lives
are worth a quick buck.

19:10.453 --> 19:12.412
It's right here.
It's right there.

19:12.412 --> 19:13.369
Good, they're
still conscious.

19:13.369 --> 19:14.979
But how thick
are these doors?

19:14.979 --> 19:16.546
It's reinforced to protect
everyone outside

19:16.546 --> 19:18.418
from the chemical
and heat exposure.

19:18.418 --> 19:20.333
It can get to over
1,000 degrees Celsius.

19:20.333 --> 19:22.378
How long do we expect
their gear to hold up?

19:22.378 --> 19:24.032
Their gear isn't great.

19:24.032 --> 19:26.469
I mean, they have filtration
systems, but no oxygen.

19:26.469 --> 19:28.341
And this is a green company
that put them in there?

19:28.341 --> 19:30.430
I'm ready to breach
the window, Captain.

19:30.430 --> 19:32.910
That's layers of
polycarbonate glass.
You'll never get through.

19:32.910 --> 19:35.783
There's acid!
Acid in the air!

19:35.783 --> 19:38.046
No, he's saying acid!

19:38.046 --> 19:40.353
- Stop, there's acid!
- There's acid in the air!

19:40.353 --> 19:42.833
Hughes, Ruiz, get on the roof!
Cut me a hole for ventilation!

19:42.833 --> 19:44.357
Copy, Captain!

19:44.357 --> 19:46.010
If we don't get to them
in the next 20 minutes,

19:46.010 --> 19:47.098
they're done!

19:54.541 --> 19:58.588
It is a super simple test,
just like Dr. DeLuca explained.

19:58.588 --> 20:00.286
So here's the cup.

20:00.286 --> 20:02.157
When we were in college... And-- Peggy, don't.

20:02.157 --> 20:04.464
...the unofficial slogan
of our college was

20:04.464 --> 20:06.117
"Queer in a year
or your money back."

20:06.117 --> 20:07.380
Neither of us got
our money back,

20:07.380 --> 20:08.511
but do you know
what we did get?

20:08.511 --> 20:09.947
- The clap.
- No, it wasn't the clap.

20:09.947 --> 20:11.384
We got chlamydia.

20:11.384 --> 20:12.298
Isn't that
the same thing?

20:12.298 --> 20:14.256
No, the clap
is gonorrhea.

20:14.256 --> 20:16.519
We were just comforting her
through storytelling.

20:16.519 --> 20:18.478
Yeah, and I'm sure
she appreciates it,

20:18.478 --> 20:19.740
but what I really
need you to do

20:19.740 --> 20:21.394
is to help
sorting our inventory.

20:21.394 --> 20:23.265
Yep.
Thank you.

20:23.265 --> 20:24.745
Did we just get fired
from talking to patients?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.181
I think she did
what she needed to do.

20:26.181 --> 20:27.835
Hi, Brooke.

20:27.835 --> 20:29.445
So the bathroom is gonna be
down the hall to the right.

20:29.445 --> 20:31.360
Thank you.
Yeah, no problem.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.930
- Come on through.
- Come right over here.

20:38.367 --> 20:40.717
You really wrapped tape
around the brace?

20:40.717 --> 20:43.720
It became loose
in a heated exchange.

20:43.720 --> 20:45.156
I say this
with brotherly love

20:45.156 --> 20:46.723
and all the respect
in the world--

20:46.723 --> 20:49.335
Please do not do
a Warren speech right now.

20:49.335 --> 20:50.945
I can't take it.

20:50.945 --> 20:53.730
So you are sleeping in your
truck right outside of 19

20:53.730 --> 20:55.341
because you
<i>don't</i> want help?

20:55.341 --> 20:57.168
- Got it.
- I parked my truck there

20:57.168 --> 20:58.735
because I know
the parking laws there

20:58.735 --> 21:00.955
and I can't afford
another ticket, so...

21:00.955 --> 21:02.435
You need to pull it together, alright?

21:02.435 --> 21:04.350
Because you made the mistake
of showing up here

21:04.350 --> 21:07.962
on Halloween and reminding
Pru that you exist,

21:07.962 --> 21:09.877
so now it's "Uncle Jack this"
and "Uncle Jack that,"

21:09.877 --> 21:11.574
and "When is Uncle Jack
coming over?"

21:11.574 --> 21:13.750
and "Why is Uncle Jack
dressed like a boxer?"

21:13.750 --> 21:15.317
She loves you, man, alright?

21:15.317 --> 21:17.885
And she has lost enough,
so when you disappoint Pru,

21:17.885 --> 21:20.714
you disappoint me,
and I get to give you a lecture.

21:20.714 --> 21:22.019
You know what's
disappointing to me?

21:22.019 --> 21:23.369
What?

21:23.369 --> 21:25.414
What you've done
to this clinic.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.112
Yeah, it was supposed
to be accessible,
bare bones, you know?

21:28.112 --> 21:32.334
But what you've done is added
intake forms and white coats,

21:32.334 --> 21:35.468
which basically makes it
another hospital.

21:35.468 --> 21:37.600
Yeah, Peggy and Dayna
would never be allowed
to work in a hospital.

21:37.600 --> 21:40.124
Okay, fine, Gibson.

21:40.124 --> 21:41.474
Look, i-i-if you think
that we got it wrong,

21:41.474 --> 21:43.432
then come back
and help us get it back

21:43.432 --> 21:46.566
to what it used to be,
'cause I'm not gonna do it.

21:46.566 --> 21:48.002
Hey, that's manipulative.

21:48.002 --> 21:50.134
Nope, that's the truth.

21:50.134 --> 21:53.790
Because I was trained
as a doctor, and so was Carina.

21:53.790 --> 21:56.271
With you gone,
we reverted to what we know.

21:56.271 --> 21:57.707
You were the one with
the lived experience

21:57.707 --> 21:59.187
of growing up
on the streets

21:59.187 --> 22:00.797
and fearing
the medical establishment.

22:00.797 --> 22:02.364
If you think that we've
gotten away from your vision,

22:02.364 --> 22:04.148
then come back.

22:04.148 --> 22:06.803
But in the meantime,
why don't you get a shower

22:06.803 --> 22:08.936
and a shave and take a nap
in your old bunk?

22:08.936 --> 22:10.720
I can't.
It's against the rules.

22:10.720 --> 22:13.680
Screw the rules.
It's doctor's orders.

22:16.639 --> 22:18.249
I'm sor-- sorry.
I'm--

22:18.249 --> 22:20.774
- No, it's my-- My fault.
- Fault-- My-- Sorry.

22:21.862 --> 22:23.429
Oh, hi.
Do you have your sample?

22:23.429 --> 22:28.521
No. I...forgot where you told me
the bathroom was.

22:28.521 --> 22:30.479
To the right.

22:30.479 --> 22:32.568
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

22:37.834 --> 22:40.315
Bishop, check it again!

22:40.315 --> 22:43.100
Please tell me it made any kind
of hole we can put air through.

22:43.100 --> 22:45.276
Nothing!
Let's go again!

22:45.276 --> 22:47.453
Whoa! Wait!

22:47.453 --> 22:50.456
Hey! What's happening
to them in there?

22:50.456 --> 22:52.675
It must be
the sulfuric acid rising!

22:52.675 --> 22:54.808
If it's increasing in the air,
it can eat through their suits!

22:54.808 --> 22:56.026
Hey, hey!
Hey, get down!

22:56.026 --> 22:57.332
- Get down!
- Lay down on the floor!

22:59.421 --> 23:02.468
This is evil.
These owners are evil.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.121
Yeah, evil
or incredibly stupid.

23:04.121 --> 23:05.993
Either way, let's go.

23:05.993 --> 23:10.780
Ladder 19 to SFD!
O2 concentration's at 16%!

23:10.780 --> 23:13.479
Sulfuric acid levels
are almost critical!

23:13.479 --> 23:17.308
Do we have any word on shutting
down the power to this plant?!

23:17.308 --> 23:18.788
Negative, Ladder 19.

23:18.788 --> 23:20.660
I'm still waiting for a response
from the power company.

23:20.660 --> 23:24.577
Hughes, Ruiz, what's the status
on that ventilation system?!

23:24.577 --> 23:26.535
Captain, we've
popped three vents,

23:26.535 --> 23:28.450
but there's still
a metal seal underneath.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.713
This room is a fortress,
but we're prying down
to the next level.

23:30.713 --> 23:33.324
Pick it up, Ruiz
and report back with progress!

23:33.324 --> 23:35.457
Dispatch, we need
another Hazmat unit!

23:35.457 --> 23:37.459
The acid levels
are increasing... Liz: I can't do this!

23:37.459 --> 23:39.330
...and we don't have
much time before--I don't know.

23:39.330 --> 23:40.897
Ma'am, who are
- you talking to?
- I'm sorry. I just--

23:40.897 --> 23:42.464
It's my manager!
He said he can't help!

23:42.464 --> 23:43.813
I don't know
what to do!

23:43.813 --> 23:45.336
I need you to put him
on speaker.

23:45.336 --> 23:47.251
Put him on speaker.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.471
<i>Captain, what are
your latest exposure readings?</i>

23:49.471 --> 23:51.125
Dispatch, stand by!

23:51.125 --> 23:52.692
This is Captain Beckett
with the SFD.

23:52.692 --> 23:54.476
If you don't come down here
in the next 10 minutes

23:54.476 --> 23:56.609
and give us access
to this room,

23:56.609 --> 23:58.611
you will be criminally liable

23:58.611 --> 23:59.655
for the deaths
of your employees!

23:59.655 --> 24:01.396
Is that understood?!

24:01.396 --> 24:03.354
<i>No, I don't have access!
I don't need to!</i>

24:03.354 --> 24:05.705
<i>This is a foolproof process
with an engineer!</i>

24:05.705 --> 24:07.402
<i>Rafi was the one
who abandoned his post!</i>

24:07.402 --> 24:09.709
You ordered them to start
the process without Rafi!

24:09.709 --> 24:11.537
<i>You are going to prison!</i>

24:11.537 --> 24:12.842
Rafi.

24:19.762 --> 24:22.330
Rafi.

24:22.330 --> 24:24.419
Let's think
- this through.
- Look, I don't want
to think about it!

24:24.419 --> 24:26.595
What do you want?

24:26.595 --> 24:29.337
I-I want
to be a person.

24:29.337 --> 24:30.686
Okay.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.558
I want to not be a thing
that a company can just use

24:32.558 --> 24:34.298
and then throw away
when it doesn't work anymore.

24:34.298 --> 24:36.083
I get that.

24:36.083 --> 24:39.652
I had a co-worker, man--
no, a friend--

24:39.652 --> 24:43.394
who got me this job
when I was down bad and
I needed it the most.

24:43.394 --> 24:45.701
I mean, he was such
a stand-up dude, man.

24:45.701 --> 24:47.790
I-I saw what the contamination
did to him.

24:47.790 --> 24:50.401
I-I-I watched
him deteriorate.

24:50.401 --> 24:53.622
And the company, they just--
they just shrugged.

24:53.622 --> 24:56.146
Told him to make
sure his replacement
was properly trained.

24:56.146 --> 24:57.583
You have every right
to be angry.

24:57.583 --> 24:59.976
I just said goodbye to him
a week ago.

24:59.976 --> 25:01.761
I watched them kill my friend
and I did nothing.

25:01.761 --> 25:03.327
<i>Herrera, come in.</i>

25:03.327 --> 25:04.764
Listen, I-I'm sorry
about your friend.

25:04.764 --> 25:06.156
<i>I read you, Chief.</i>

25:06.156 --> 25:08.115
I need you to back out of
earshot of the scene, please.

25:08.115 --> 25:10.247
Copy that. Clear.

25:10.247 --> 25:11.684
<i>Herrera, what's the name
of the individual</i>

25:11.684 --> 25:13.120
<i>you're speaking
to on this call?</i>

25:13.120 --> 25:14.774
Raphael, ma'am.

25:14.774 --> 25:15.905
Is he a battery plant
engineer?

25:15.905 --> 25:17.603
Did he leave his job
this morning?

25:17.603 --> 25:19.822
Yeah, he works at a factory
that has chemicals.

25:19.822 --> 25:21.258
What--
What's going on?

25:21.258 --> 25:23.696
<i>19 is on a call at
a battery recycling plant,</i>

25:23.696 --> 25:25.785
<i>and their engineer didn't
come in today.</i>

25:25.785 --> 25:28.048
That man may be the key
to saving eight other lives

25:28.048 --> 25:29.702
on another call.

25:29.702 --> 25:32.618
Raphael, I know what it's like
to feel like you

25:32.618 --> 25:34.271
belong to an institution.

25:34.271 --> 25:36.056
I-I know what it's like to feel
like you're being

25:36.056 --> 25:37.840
used and discarded.

25:37.840 --> 25:39.842
It's hard.
I-It's scary.

25:39.842 --> 25:41.844
But listen, you quit them.

25:41.844 --> 25:44.934
You quit those institutions,
you don't quit on yourself.

25:44.934 --> 25:46.632
Look, you deserve to live.

25:46.632 --> 25:50.679
You-- You deserve to figure out
who you are outside of them.

25:50.679 --> 25:52.638
You deserve to reclaim
your life,

25:52.638 --> 25:55.292
not just your death, brother,
your-- your life.

25:55.292 --> 25:57.599
Sullivan... What-- What are you whispering?
Don't whisper about me!

25:57.599 --> 25:59.166
Hey!
No, no, no, no!

25:59.166 --> 26:00.733
Raphael,
are you an engineer

26:00.733 --> 26:02.256
at a battery recycling
plant?

26:02.256 --> 26:03.692
How'd you know that?

26:03.692 --> 26:04.998
Your-- Your people
are in trouble.

26:04.998 --> 26:06.869
They're locked in.

26:06.869 --> 26:08.567
Wait, what?
Hey!

26:17.880 --> 26:19.708
No!

26:22.493 --> 26:24.800
No!

26:25.758 --> 26:26.976
Clarke!
Clarke, I need your help!

26:26.976 --> 26:28.674
- Okay, I'm coming!
- Pull, hard!

26:28.674 --> 26:29.979
- I'm not trained for this.
- Pull.

26:29.979 --> 26:32.112
- I'm not trained for this!
- Just dig deeper!

26:35.681 --> 26:37.683
I don't want to die.
I don't want to die.

26:37.683 --> 26:38.771
Sullivan, you got him?

26:38.771 --> 26:40.860
Lower us
down a few feet.

26:40.860 --> 26:43.253
Listen to me.
I'm gonna go downstairs.

26:43.253 --> 26:44.907
What I need you to do

26:44.907 --> 26:46.866
is open up this clamp
- when I say so.
- Okay.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.998
It's gonna give the rope
- some slack.
- Okay.

26:48.998 --> 26:50.696
When I say close it,
I need you to shut it.

26:50.696 --> 26:51.784
Okay. Okay.
Alright?

26:51.784 --> 26:52.828
You got it?
I got it!

26:52.828 --> 26:54.743
You sure?
I got it!

26:54.743 --> 26:56.136
I don't want to die like this.
Please. Please!

26:56.136 --> 26:58.138
I got you.
Okay? I got you.

26:58.138 --> 26:59.922
Hold on.

26:59.922 --> 27:03.447
Alright, start lowering it,
Clarke! Go ahead!

27:03.447 --> 27:06.146
I'm not trained for this.

27:06.146 --> 27:07.843
Just a few feet.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.584
I don't want to die, man.
I don't want to die like this.

27:09.584 --> 27:11.151
I got you.

27:11.151 --> 27:12.892
Please, please.

27:12.892 --> 27:15.024
Sullivan,
- I'm right here.
- Yeah.

27:15.024 --> 27:18.724
Okay, Clarke,
that's enough! Stop!

27:18.724 --> 27:19.942
I got you.

27:19.942 --> 27:21.509
- Grab his legs.
- I got his legs.

27:26.906 --> 27:28.951
Dispatch, this is Crisis One.

28:29.664 --> 28:30.883
- Ready?
- Let's go.

28:30.883 --> 28:32.362
♪ Meet me on the other side

28:32.362 --> 28:34.669
♪ Underneath the cold,
underneath the rain ♪

28:34.669 --> 28:46.028
♪ There will be a way

28:46.028 --> 28:47.813
♪ Underneath the cold,
underneath the rain ♪

28:47.813 --> 28:50.685
♪ There will be a way,
there will be a way ♪

28:50.685 --> 28:53.079
♪ There will,
there will be a way ♪

28:54.733 --> 28:56.212
The results are negative.

28:56.212 --> 28:58.998
No UTIs and a negative
pregnancy test.

28:58.998 --> 29:01.261
Great. Yay, me.

29:03.045 --> 29:04.481
Hey,
are you sure this is

29:04.481 --> 29:05.874
the real reason
why you came in today?

29:05.874 --> 29:07.354
Because usually when
college girls

29:07.354 --> 29:08.921
find out
they're not pregnant,

29:08.921 --> 29:11.924
they're a lot more relieved
than you are right now.

29:11.924 --> 29:16.624
No.

29:16.624 --> 29:18.582
Have you ever thought
that even though someone

29:18.582 --> 29:21.020
has made it very clear they want
nothing to do with you,

29:21.020 --> 29:23.196
that you could
change their mind?

29:23.196 --> 29:25.981
Like, if they could just see
what they were missing,

29:25.981 --> 29:28.375
but, like, you could show them,
that then they would just--

29:28.375 --> 29:29.942
see how different
things could be?

29:29.942 --> 29:31.595
I'm sorry.
I'm lost.

29:31.595 --> 29:34.033
Uh, did you maybe come in
for mental health services?

29:34.033 --> 29:35.251
Because we can help.

29:35.251 --> 29:36.426
- No.
- Okay.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.993
No.

29:37.993 --> 29:40.735
No, if-- if you
love someone,

29:40.735 --> 29:43.216
you honor their
boundaries, right?

29:43.216 --> 29:45.087
Huh.
Don't answer that.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.394
I know I'm right.
I wasted your time.

29:47.394 --> 29:52.616
Thank you, and please thank
your over-sharing volunteers.

29:52.616 --> 29:54.662
I will.
And here.

29:54.662 --> 29:56.664
Would you deliver this, please?

29:56.664 --> 29:59.014
Sure.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.799
To who?

30:09.982 --> 30:12.027
I'll be okay. Okay.

30:13.159 --> 30:14.943
Okay, got you.

30:17.903 --> 30:19.121
Is he gonna be okay?

30:19.121 --> 30:21.036
Liz?

30:21.036 --> 30:22.690
We're giving him O2 now,
and we're gonna transfer him

30:22.690 --> 30:24.126
Grey-Sloan Memorial, okay?

30:24.126 --> 30:25.345
Oh, he's having
a seizure!

30:25.345 --> 30:27.042
We need to dose him
with benzos immediately!

30:27.042 --> 30:28.696
He must have breathed in
too many chemicals.

30:28.696 --> 30:30.263
Ma'am, hang back.
We have to let them work.

30:30.263 --> 30:34.484
- No, no! No!
- No, no, no, no, no.

30:34.484 --> 30:36.530
- No, this-- this is my fault.
- Hey, hey, hey!
Wait, wait, wait.

30:36.530 --> 30:37.836
What's going on, Dev?!

30:43.189 --> 30:46.018
Alright, buddy, we got you.
We got you.

30:46.018 --> 30:47.236
- Please do something!
- Okay, he's stabilizing,

30:47.236 --> 30:48.324
but we got to get him
out of here now!

30:48.324 --> 30:50.152
Now, now, now,
now, now!

30:50.152 --> 30:51.893
Devin!

30:54.504 --> 30:56.506
Liz, I'm so sorry, okay?

30:56.506 --> 30:58.595
I didn't mean to hurt anybody
except me today.

30:58.595 --> 31:00.162
I didn't know that
they were gonna make--

31:00.162 --> 31:01.947
Liz!

31:07.735 --> 31:09.215
Hey, miss.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.176
I shouldn't have started
this process without you!

31:14.176 --> 31:17.397
It's my fault!
This is my fault if Devin dies!

31:17.397 --> 31:19.965
Hey, it is not
your fault, okay?

31:19.965 --> 31:22.054
Do you hear me?
It is their fault.

31:22.054 --> 31:25.057
It's their fault.
It is not your fault.

31:25.057 --> 31:27.189
It's not your fault,
I promise, okay?

31:27.189 --> 31:29.409
Look, I swear to God,
I'm gonna spend whatever days

31:29.409 --> 31:32.368
I have left making sure
these bastards pay.

31:32.368 --> 31:34.109
Okay?
It's not your fault.

31:36.024 --> 31:39.332
I'm taking it back.
I'm taking it back.

31:42.074 --> 31:43.118
It's not your fault.

31:48.254 --> 31:50.038
You know what?

31:50.038 --> 31:52.040
Don't get me wrong,
I am grateful for the help,

31:52.040 --> 31:53.955
but Peggy and Dayna are like
a two-headed bull

31:53.955 --> 31:55.348
in a china shop in here.

31:55.348 --> 31:57.002
Hey, I don't even
have the energy

31:57.002 --> 31:59.395
to translate
that expression right now.

31:59.395 --> 32:02.094
- Is Jack still here?
- Yeah, yeah.

32:02.094 --> 32:04.835
He's taking a nap
in his old bunk.

32:04.835 --> 32:06.098
What's that?
I don't know,

32:06.098 --> 32:09.057
but a patient came in to
drop this for him today.

32:09.057 --> 32:11.755
Okay, so, they just came by
to drop it off for Gibson?

32:11.755 --> 32:16.935
Actually, she came in for a UTI
and a pregnancy test.

32:18.197 --> 32:21.591
Okay, I-I don't know if he can
take any more bad news.

32:21.591 --> 32:24.029
He's--They were both negative.

32:24.029 --> 32:26.031
Oh, well, okay, then.

32:26.031 --> 32:27.380
Uh...

32:27.380 --> 32:29.121
What--

32:30.731 --> 32:34.474
Hey, uh, Travis?
Can I grab you for a second?

32:34.474 --> 32:35.779
Look--

32:35.779 --> 32:37.564
Uh, no, I just
wanted to say,

32:37.564 --> 32:40.349
I should have anticipated
this move by Dixon.

32:40.349 --> 32:42.003
- No, you shouldn't have.
- It was not--

32:42.003 --> 32:43.222
You shouldn't have
because it was disgusting.

32:43.222 --> 32:44.832
It was a disgusting move.

32:44.832 --> 32:46.268
Yeah, I should have anticipated

32:46.268 --> 32:48.792
this disgusting
move by Dixon, but I--

32:48.792 --> 32:50.794
Um, I think that would have
required me

32:50.794 --> 32:54.668
to unearth
some of my Ripley stuff,

32:54.668 --> 32:56.844
and I have been
compartmentalizing that far away

32:56.844 --> 32:58.933
from my thinking mind,
so that--

32:58.933 --> 33:00.413
What someone should have
done was locked

33:00.413 --> 33:02.719
Travis' records
since day one.

33:02.719 --> 33:05.026
Yeah, that is what
I should have thought of.

33:05.026 --> 33:07.246
And what you need now
is a spin.

33:07.246 --> 33:09.900
Okay, I'm sorry.
- Who are you?
- Vic, meet Eli.

33:09.900 --> 33:13.165
Eli is, uh, trying to be
my campaign manager.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.297
Trying, but I told him.

33:15.297 --> 33:18.126
Okay, so how exactly do you
spin aggravated assault?

33:18.126 --> 33:20.520
He's trying to appeal
to firefighters, right?

33:20.520 --> 33:22.043
I read the arrest report.

33:22.043 --> 33:23.392
Travis got into that fight
standing up

33:23.392 --> 33:26.178
for another firefighter
after disparaging remarks

33:26.178 --> 33:28.528
were made about a recently
deceased fire chief.

33:28.528 --> 33:31.966
Yeah, um...
he was defending me, actually.

33:31.966 --> 33:33.402
That's even better.

33:33.402 --> 33:36.275
So he's wiling to fight
for women in the field.

33:36.275 --> 33:39.191
A sobering perspective that'll
have you praised by firefighters

33:39.191 --> 33:41.541
and the union alike.

33:41.541 --> 33:43.978
This might be the first time
you've actually done something
they can relate to.

33:43.978 --> 33:46.111
Okay, well, he's good.

33:46.111 --> 33:47.721
I'm only as good as you
allow me to be.

33:47.721 --> 33:49.244
I can't do that much
from the sidelines.

33:49.244 --> 33:50.985
Yes, and thank you.

33:50.985 --> 33:52.117
Thank you, Eli,
for all of this.

33:52.117 --> 33:53.770
Truly, thank you.

33:53.770 --> 33:55.207
But like I said, I did--You know what, Travis?

33:55.207 --> 33:57.165
Actually, I don't think
I will have time

33:57.165 --> 33:59.341
to manage
your campaign anymore.

33:59.341 --> 34:00.342
I'm gonna be busy
recruiting the future

34:00.342 --> 34:02.170
female firefighters
of Seattle.

34:02.170 --> 34:04.433
- No, Vic, no, no.
- No, I'm serious.
You're fired.

34:04.433 --> 34:06.479
<i>I'm</i> fired?

34:06.479 --> 34:08.002
I'm fired.
I'm fired.

34:08.002 --> 34:11.223
I don't care.
I'm just saying you need... him.

34:11.223 --> 34:13.225
You need him.

34:13.225 --> 34:15.792
Whenever you're done with this,
we should talk strategy.

34:20.406 --> 34:23.235
I am so happy
that you are still here.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.324
How was the call?

34:25.324 --> 34:28.457
It was almost really awful
and really devastating,

34:28.457 --> 34:30.459
and then it wasn't.

34:30.459 --> 34:33.680
Kinda like us.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.247
Did you take
a pregnancy test?

34:35.247 --> 34:37.771
No. I wouldn't do that
without you.

34:37.771 --> 34:39.251
Good.
So what's wrong?

34:39.251 --> 34:41.818
I still need
you to get help.

34:41.818 --> 34:45.909
I want us to be in love and--
and have sex and make a baby,

34:45.909 --> 34:48.782
and I need you
to be getting help.

34:48.782 --> 34:50.131
I'm holding on
to this boundary,

34:50.131 --> 34:52.264
and I'm just asking you
to honor it.

34:54.222 --> 34:57.007
My love, I think that
growing up with your dad,

34:57.007 --> 34:59.358
you developed
some control issues.

34:59.358 --> 35:01.838
And I feel like you're
using the truth

35:01.838 --> 35:04.145
in a way that makes it
impossible for me to argue.

35:04.145 --> 35:06.234
I don't want to argue
anymore, okay?

35:06.234 --> 35:08.149
I want you to understand
that I'm helping myself

35:08.149 --> 35:10.282
in a way
that works for me.

35:10.282 --> 35:12.153
Talking doesn't work
for me, okay?

35:12.153 --> 35:14.547
I'm working through my anger
and my pain in my way.

35:14.547 --> 35:17.289
And if that makes you angry,
if that hurts you,

35:17.289 --> 35:20.379
then you should work
on that your way.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.989
But trying
to control me,

35:21.989 --> 35:24.644
that's not gonna work
for either of us.

35:37.047 --> 35:39.615
What Dixon did is just
normal politics.

35:39.615 --> 35:41.269
In fact, he respected you enough
to take the kid gloves off

35:41.269 --> 35:43.837
and get his hands dirty.
So now, we return the favor.

35:43.837 --> 35:46.579
Oh, Travis, did you let
this guy talk you over

35:46.579 --> 35:48.102
to the dark side?

35:48.102 --> 35:49.538
Yeah, about that.

35:49.538 --> 35:51.758
How dark side
are we talking?

35:51.758 --> 35:53.977
Nothing illegal
or unethical.

35:53.977 --> 35:56.415
Ha.
Define "unethical,"

35:56.415 --> 35:58.547
because I think
your standards may be different.

35:58.547 --> 36:00.419
Do you see the boost
in Dixon's ratings?

36:00.419 --> 36:02.203
It's time to get serious.

36:02.203 --> 36:03.552
Yeah, but serious
doesn't mean

36:03.552 --> 36:05.815
Travis starts twirling
his little mustache

36:05.815 --> 36:07.382
behind closed doors.

36:07.382 --> 36:09.993
Yeah, if we hit the point
where we're tying Kitty Dixon

36:09.993 --> 36:11.821
up to railroad tracks,
I think I'm out.

36:11.821 --> 36:13.127
Sounds like a deal.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.389
A deal with the devil.

36:14.389 --> 36:16.261
You can think what you like,
but I don't intend

36:16.261 --> 36:17.827
to sit idly by while
Michael Dixon

36:17.827 --> 36:19.481
runs this city
into the ground.

36:19.481 --> 36:22.136
This city? Wow.
This city is our city.

36:22.136 --> 36:24.356
We grew up here.
This-- This isn't your city.

36:24.356 --> 36:26.358
Oh, I see.
So you're a fan of Dixon?

36:26.358 --> 36:27.446
Don't do that?
Do what?

36:27.446 --> 36:29.448
- Spin me.
- Wouldn't dream of it.

36:31.145 --> 36:33.278
This station has taken
too many hits lately.

36:33.278 --> 36:35.932
I'm not gonna watch you turn
Travis into someone he's not.

36:35.932 --> 36:38.108
You mean
a winning candidate?

36:38.108 --> 36:41.024
Wow,
you really don't quit.

36:41.024 --> 36:42.374
Correct.
It's why I win.

36:42.374 --> 36:45.203
Mm.
That's why I walk away.

36:46.421 --> 36:48.031
You're probably better
at diplomacy

36:48.031 --> 36:49.381
when you're
working, right?

36:57.519 --> 36:59.478
I-I can't believe that you
just dove off the side

36:59.478 --> 37:01.262
of that building.

37:01.262 --> 37:02.742
That is something you would
have yelled at me for.

37:02.742 --> 37:04.091
- Hey, Chief.
- Hey.

37:04.091 --> 37:05.875
- Chief. How you doing?
- Gentlemen.

37:05.875 --> 37:08.313
Sounds like you had a rough one
out there, huh, Sullivan?

37:08.313 --> 37:10.271
- Yeah.
- But the way you connected
those two dots,

37:10.271 --> 37:13.187
that was,
um... impressive.

37:13.187 --> 37:16.408
I appreciate that.

37:16.408 --> 37:18.366
Hey, Chief.

37:18.366 --> 37:19.672
Can I walk with you?

37:19.672 --> 37:21.064
Yeah, what's up, Ruiz?

37:21.064 --> 37:23.153
I assume
you know my history.

37:23.153 --> 37:24.720
I was a captain.

37:24.720 --> 37:27.201
I made a bad call that cost
my best friend his life.

37:27.201 --> 37:29.508
I do. I do.

37:29.508 --> 37:31.510
Well,
19 is my home now.

37:31.510 --> 37:34.339
It's my family, and I refuse
to see it at risk

37:34.339 --> 37:36.776
because of a captain who has
no interest in seeing us united.

37:36.776 --> 37:39.735
Those-- Those are some
major accusations, Ruiz.

37:39.735 --> 37:41.433
We had
a rough call, Chief.

37:41.433 --> 37:43.913
- Today wasn't on Beckett.
- Well, maybe not.

37:43.913 --> 37:46.438
Maybe not, but we've had
a lot of rough calls.

37:46.438 --> 37:50.006
You know, morale is low,
and it's making me itchy.

37:50.006 --> 37:52.531
You know, I'm checking batteries
on the smoke alarms.

37:52.531 --> 37:54.359
I'm double checking his work,
you know?

37:54.359 --> 37:56.665
'Cause I don't-- I don't want
to go through it again.

37:56.665 --> 37:58.580
I don't want to lose
anyone else.

37:58.580 --> 38:00.539
Ruiz, listen.

38:00.539 --> 38:03.019
I'm not saying he's a bad
firefighter, okay? I'm not.

38:03.019 --> 38:06.371
But he's a crap leader,
and in this house,

38:06.371 --> 38:10.462
when everyone has big
personalities and big opinions,

38:10.462 --> 38:11.941
we need a leader.

38:11.941 --> 38:14.901
I don't like coming to you,
but I got a bad feeling.

38:33.223 --> 38:37.576
Well, well, look at you.

38:37.576 --> 38:39.142
Look at <i>you.</i>

38:39.142 --> 38:40.709
Warren wanted me
to give this to you.

38:40.709 --> 38:42.145
It's not another
lecture, is it?

38:42.145 --> 38:43.495
'Cause he's been on
fire today.

38:43.495 --> 38:45.366
No, no, it's not
a lecture.

38:45.366 --> 38:48.151
But it might be
a paternity test?

38:48.151 --> 38:49.805
Are you serious?

38:49.805 --> 38:52.504
Yeah. Some gorgeous lady
dropped it off.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.506
There's a betting pool downstairs.

38:54.506 --> 38:58.640
This house has missed you.
I've missed you.

38:58.640 --> 39:02.731
You are so loved.

39:02.731 --> 39:07.519
And no, this is not a lecture.
It's just a welcome home.

39:07.519 --> 39:10.739
I'm not quite home.

39:10.739 --> 39:12.437
Yeah, but you could be.

39:12.437 --> 39:15.614
I mean, you could
talk to Chief Ross.

39:15.614 --> 39:16.876
I will.

39:16.876 --> 39:20.445
You will?

39:20.445 --> 39:22.272
Yes.

39:24.492 --> 39:30.106
I could cheer or...
I could cry,

39:30.106 --> 39:32.892
but, um [clears throat] I had
a really intense call today,

39:32.892 --> 39:37.984
so I think I'm just
gonna go downstairs.

39:37.984 --> 39:42.902
Unless you wanna open
the envelope and settle the bet.

39:42.902 --> 39:44.469
What'd you bet?

39:44.469 --> 39:48.211
A grown daughter
you never knew about?

39:48.211 --> 39:49.909
I'll keep you posted.
