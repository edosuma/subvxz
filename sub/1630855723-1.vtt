01:16.185 --> 01:18.476
-You're late, Jacques.
-Sorry, Father.

01:18.611 --> 01:19.843
Go fetch the wine.

01:20.112 --> 01:20.754
[Jacques under his breath]
Why don't

01:20.889 --> 01:22.054
you go fetch the wine?

01:22.190 --> 01:23.817
-Pardon?
-[Jacques] Er, nothing.

01:24.717 --> 01:26.358
[tolling continuing]

01:50.715 --> 01:53.177
[priest] Let your spirit
come upon these gifts

01:53.312 --> 01:57.081
to make them holy
so that they may become for us,

01:57.216 --> 02:01.891
the body and blood of our Lord,
Jesus Christ.

02:02.160 --> 02:03.692
[bell tinkles]

02:06.834 --> 02:08.063
Body of Christ.

02:08.199 --> 02:09.236
[woman] Amen.

02:12.338 --> 02:13.900
-The blood of Christ.
-Amen.

-Yes?

04:25.669 --> 04:27.334

-Where?

05:02.339 --> 05:03.701
Who's there?

05:03.837 --> 05:05.235
[objects clattering]

05:05.371 --> 05:09.246
Whoever you are,
whatever you are here for,

05:09.382 --> 05:10.516
you are in a house of God.

05:12.384 --> 05:13.380
And He's watching you.

05:13.516 --> 05:14.850
[soft groans]

07:20.544 --> 07:22.549
[all laughing]

07:35.862 --> 07:39.225
[Reverend Mother] Sister Irene!
Sister Irene!

07:41.565 --> 07:42.431
Sister Debra.

07:42.566 --> 07:44.438
It's Sister Debra.

07:44.573 --> 07:45.536
[Reverend Mother]
<i> She's trouble.</i>

07:45.671 --> 07:48.399
Every day she's making trouble.

07:48.534 --> 07:51.076
And now, she refused
to go to confession.

07:51.211 --> 07:53.807
[speaks Italian]

07:53.943 --> 07:55.572
[in English] And you know why?

07:55.707 --> 07:59.750
She did not think
she had anything to confess.

07:59.886 --> 08:02.787
For that alone,
she should be confessing.

08:02.922 --> 08:04.585
I will have a talk with her,
Reverend Mother.

08:04.721 --> 08:06.021
<i> Grazie,</i> Sister.

08:16.897 --> 08:18.033
Sister Debra?

08:19.207 --> 08:20.574
Sister Irene.

08:21.936 --> 08:23.577
This about confession?

08:23.712 --> 08:25.106
You're going to give the Mother
a heart attack.

08:25.242 --> 08:27.581
Well, then maybe
I'll have something to confess.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.783
[stifles laugh]

08:38.055 --> 08:39.560
Your father
sent you here, right?

08:41.725 --> 08:44.525
Yes. I was different.

08:44.660 --> 08:48.162
Sending me away was easier than
trying to understand who I was.

08:49.901 --> 08:51.671
What'd your mama
say about that?

08:57.906 --> 08:59.239
I barely remember her.

09:00.981 --> 09:03.177
But my father always said
I was just like her.

09:05.677 --> 09:07.247
I don't think he meant it
as a compliment.

09:11.660 --> 09:15.662
Well, my family's
from Mississippi,

09:15.797 --> 09:18.128
but we ran into some trouble
down there.

09:18.264 --> 09:21.531
When I was four, white folks,
they found where we were,

09:21.666 --> 09:22.867
burned our house down.

09:24.696 --> 09:27.806
After that,
my brothers joined the army.

09:27.941 --> 09:30.970
My dad figured,
"My boys can serve country,

09:31.105 --> 09:33.306
my daughter can serve God."

09:34.882 --> 09:36.479
Never in my wildest dreams
did I think

09:36.615 --> 09:38.146
I was gonna end up here.

09:41.855 --> 09:43.723
Do I still have
to go to confession?

09:46.121 --> 09:47.694
I think
you've confessed enough.

09:49.563 --> 09:50.762
[elder sister] One by one,

09:50.898 --> 09:54.063
the sisters
found themselves murdered.

09:54.198 --> 09:58.863
Hanging from windows.
Throats slit open.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.934
Acts of suicide.

10:01.069 --> 10:03.534
[whispers] Sometimes worse.

10:03.669 --> 10:06.708
They learned
that beneath their remote abbey

10:06.843 --> 10:09.842
was a terrible secret.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.719
A gateway to hell.

10:12.854 --> 10:17.889
And from this gateway,
a demon had escaped.

10:19.928 --> 10:23.126
Now, we know that a demon
can take any form,

10:23.261 --> 10:27.565
but they choose their form
to challenge your faith

10:27.700 --> 10:29.736
and to weaken your spirits.

10:31.706 --> 10:35.872
Now, for the nuns
of Saint Carta,

10:36.007 --> 10:40.038
this demon
chose the most ungodly,

10:40.174 --> 10:43.814
the most blasphemous form.

10:43.950 --> 10:47.413
It chose
to look like one of them.

10:49.119 --> 10:51.055
[Sister Debra]
And then what happened?

10:51.191 --> 10:54.722
Well, the Vatican sent in
a pair of demon hunters.

10:54.858 --> 10:59.064
A priest and a nun.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.929
-And how did they stop it?
-[elder sister] Great question.

11:02.064 --> 11:04.761
They used an ancient relic,

11:04.896 --> 11:11.603
a vial which contained
the blood of Jesus Christ.

11:11.738 --> 11:15.810
So, they returned as heroes,
kissed the Pope's ring.

11:15.946 --> 11:18.608
Priest was made a bishop.

11:18.743 --> 11:20.952
[sister 2]
What happened to the nun?

11:21.087 --> 11:23.415
[elder sister]
Well, no one really knows.

11:23.650 --> 11:26.254
They say the experience
was too much for her.

11:27.287 --> 11:30.753
Some say that she went mad.

11:30.889 --> 11:34.427
The Vatican had to lock her up
in an asylum.

11:49.341 --> 11:52.047
[Celeste] Gotcha! Quick!

11:52.182 --> 11:53.983
Why does Madame
have so much wine?

11:54.118 --> 11:55.213
[girl] This used
to be a monastery.

11:55.349 --> 11:57.023
The monks were all fat drunks.

11:57.159 --> 11:58.253
[laughs]

12:01.428 --> 12:02.763
[both giggling]

12:04.992 --> 12:06.129
[both laughing]

12:16.145 --> 12:19.311
Everyone downstairs, please.
It's nearly eight o'clock.

12:19.447 --> 12:20.506
Come on, now.

12:22.451 --> 12:23.850
[indistinct chatter]

12:26.048 --> 12:27.183
[Celeste] I got 'em.

12:29.150 --> 12:30.450
Took you long enough.

12:56.380 --> 12:57.846
[Madame Laurent]
Hail Mary, full of grace,

12:57.981 --> 12:58.881
the Lord is with thee.

12:59.017 --> 13:00.381
Blessed art thou among women,

13:00.516 --> 13:03.847
and blessed is the fruit
of thy womb, Jesus.

13:03.982 --> 13:07.089
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

13:07.224 --> 13:08.954
and at the hour
of our-- [screams]

13:09.090 --> 13:10.263
Jesus Christ!

13:10.398 --> 13:11.392
Bloody hell!

13:30.175 --> 13:31.049
Kate.

13:32.877 --> 13:35.319
-Good morning.
-Hard at work already?

13:35.455 --> 13:36.516
Always.

13:39.385 --> 13:40.421
Good morning, Maurice.

13:41.923 --> 13:42.896
Captain!

13:45.259 --> 13:46.526
Come on now, Sophie.

13:49.529 --> 13:51.736
-Hi, Maurice.
-Morning.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.963
-Morning, Maurice.
-Ladies.

13:54.098 --> 13:56.433
Hey, Maurice, do you wanna play
baseball with us today?

13:56.568 --> 13:58.275
Course, I do. You know what?

13:58.410 --> 14:02.147
I'll teach you how
to throw a knuckleball. [blows]

14:02.282 --> 14:04.580
-[Sophie] Maurice. Maurice.
-Oh. Captain Sophie.

14:04.815 --> 14:06.579
Lieutenant.

14:06.814 --> 14:09.586
I made this for you.
It's a friendship bracelet.

14:09.822 --> 14:10.956
Each bead represents

14:11.092 --> 14:12.287
a different quality
of a good friend.

14:12.423 --> 14:14.156
Wow. It's beautiful, Sophie.
Thank you.

14:14.291 --> 14:17.129
[girls laughing]
Woo-hoo! Woo! Woo!

14:17.265 --> 14:20.131
Are you proposing to
your boyfriend, little Sophie?

14:24.070 --> 14:25.763
-Give it back.
-You can't make me.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.271
You're not a teacher.
You're the servant.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.943
Even the servant knows

14:40.078 --> 14:43.389
you should treat everyone
with kindness and respect.

14:43.524 --> 14:45.090
[whistle blows]

14:46.927 --> 14:48.359
-Girls.
-[girls] Oui, Madame.

14:48.495 --> 14:53.999
What do you think you're doing?
This is not a playground!

14:54.134 --> 14:56.033
-Get to class!
-<i> Oui,</i> Madame.

14:56.169 --> 14:59.038
-And you, Maurice.
-[Maurice] Mm?

14:59.174 --> 15:01.638
There was a cockroach
in my quarters again.

15:01.874 --> 15:02.974
Ah, that's unfortunate.

15:03.110 --> 15:05.304
It's an infestation.
It's disgusting.

15:05.439 --> 15:08.143
I'll tend to it right away.

15:08.278 --> 15:10.181
-You'd better.
-I promise.

15:12.214 --> 15:14.647
Captain! Captain! Wait.

15:20.362 --> 15:21.225
[blows]

15:25.359 --> 15:26.426
How did you do that?

15:26.561 --> 15:28.298
Skills I learned
from another life.

15:29.329 --> 15:31.199
How do I look?

15:31.334 --> 15:33.039
Come on, get to class. Come on.

You're fine. You're fine.

You have a visitor.

[Cardinal Conroy] Sister Irene.

21:28.556 --> 21:29.857
Your Eminence.

21:31.522 --> 21:33.366
[Cardinal Conroy]
There has been an incident.

21:34.364 --> 21:36.533
A series of them.

21:36.669 --> 21:40.266
Szeleste, a small village
in Hungary.

21:40.401 --> 21:43.776
A 90-year-old nun shot herself
on the steps of her church.

21:43.912 --> 21:45.873
Graz, Austria.

21:46.008 --> 21:48.211
A priest cut his throat open
with a rosary

21:48.346 --> 21:49.815
during Christmas mass.

21:49.951 --> 21:51.307
Edolo, Italy.

21:51.442 --> 21:54.545
A novitiate threw herself
out a window.

21:54.680 --> 21:56.718
Sound familiar?

21:56.854 --> 21:59.458
Just a month ago,
in Tarascon, France,

21:59.593 --> 22:01.926
another priest,
murdered inside his church.

22:02.061 --> 22:03.727
Immolated.

22:03.862 --> 22:07.662
Notice a pattern?
It's moving west across Europe.

22:07.798 --> 22:09.895
But its origins point
to Romania.

22:10.031 --> 22:13.635
-It can't be.
-The demon lives.

22:13.770 --> 22:14.941
Have you spoken
with Father Burke?

22:15.076 --> 22:16.640
Father Burke is dead.

22:18.410 --> 22:20.777
-How?
-Cholera.

22:20.912 --> 22:22.448
[Cardinal Conroy] You are
the only person alive

22:22.583 --> 22:24.407
who has dealt
with something like this.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.586
The Church would like
<i> you</i> to investigate.

22:27.721 --> 22:31.820
Find out what it wants
and where it's going next.

22:32.794 --> 22:33.723
No.

22:35.490 --> 22:37.092
I'm sorry?

22:37.328 --> 22:39.430
I said, "No."

22:39.565 --> 22:41.599
-I can't do it.
-Can't, or won't?

22:41.734 --> 22:44.633
You don't know what happened
at Saint Carta.

22:44.769 --> 22:46.430
I was lucky
to make it out alive.

22:46.565 --> 22:49.432
You're right. I don't know
what you faced back there.

22:49.567 --> 22:53.606
But in that abbey, Sister,
you performed a miracle.

22:53.742 --> 22:55.646
The Church needs another.

23:05.685 --> 23:07.592
[whistle blows]

23:11.527 --> 23:13.598
[breath exhaling]

23:15.636 --> 23:17.129
-[Sister Debra] Here you are.
-Sister?

23:17.364 --> 23:19.367
Was afraid I almost hopped
on the wrong train.

23:19.503 --> 23:20.797
What are you doing here?

23:20.932 --> 23:22.641
Looking after you.

23:22.776 --> 23:25.005
-Someone's gotta.
-Sister, you could be expelled.

23:25.937 --> 23:27.106
Why are you here?

23:35.813 --> 23:36.786
My mama.

23:38.456 --> 23:40.025
She died in the fire.

23:40.160 --> 23:41.791
She was my church.

23:43.793 --> 23:46.728
I want to believe in miracles.

23:46.863 --> 23:48.491
But when I see
the priest stand up

23:48.626 --> 23:51.029
and say he turned the wine
into the blood of Christ,

23:51.165 --> 23:53.534
I mean,
it's kind of hard to believe.

23:53.669 --> 23:54.935
It's an act of faith.

23:55.071 --> 23:57.369
He just says a bunch
of words to wine.

23:57.505 --> 24:01.580
The wine becomes the blood
of Christ because we believe.

24:01.715 --> 24:03.439
The most extraordinary
parts of our faith

24:03.574 --> 24:05.716
are only real
because we believe in them.

24:07.747 --> 24:08.851
I guess so.

24:10.718 --> 24:11.821
You're not ready.

24:12.553 --> 24:13.923
Why?

24:14.058 --> 24:17.025
An entire convent of nuns died
facing this thing.

24:17.160 --> 24:19.924
Women who dedicated
their lives to their faith.

24:20.059 --> 24:21.567
Then sacrificed their lives

24:21.703 --> 24:22.931
because they believed
in something greater.

24:24.665 --> 24:25.736
You need me.

24:29.734 --> 24:32.171
I just hope you can find
your faith when the time comes.

24:40.177 --> 24:42.181
[church bell tolling]

24:48.226 --> 24:50.553
[Sophie] "Why, get you gone.
Who is't that hinders you?"

24:50.688 --> 24:52.595
[Kate] "A foolish heart
that I leave here behind."

24:52.730 --> 24:54.230
[Sophie] "What, with Lysander?"

24:54.465 --> 24:55.899
"With Demetrius."

24:56.035 --> 24:58.837
"Be not afraid. She shall not
harm thee, Helena."

24:58.973 --> 25:02.574
[girl] "No, sir, she shall not,
though you take her part."

25:02.710 --> 25:06.676
"O, when she is angry,
she is keen and shrewd.

25:06.812 --> 25:09.010
She was a vixen
when she went to school.

25:09.145 --> 25:12.447
And though she be but little,
she is fierce."

25:12.583 --> 25:14.083
[girl 2] "Little again!

25:14.219 --> 25:18.084
Nothing but low and little!
Why will you suffer her--"

25:18.219 --> 25:20.824
Uh, let's take a break.
Fifteen minutes.

25:20.959 --> 25:22.923
[girl 2] I was just getting
into character.

25:23.058 --> 25:25.827
[girl 3] Yeah,
an awful character.

25:25.963 --> 25:27.692
[Kate] All right, girls.
Slowly, now.

25:27.827 --> 25:28.963
[Maurice] Girls.

25:29.099 --> 25:31.065
Sweetheart,
take these to the office.

25:37.071 --> 25:38.138
[whispering] You're the best.

25:42.245 --> 25:44.584
I heard there was
a faulty cabinet in the area?

25:46.243 --> 25:47.813
The latch won't open.

25:47.949 --> 25:49.281
-May I?
-Oh, please.

25:56.186 --> 25:57.862
Yeah. It's stuck.

25:57.998 --> 26:01.066
Can you just, please,
put a little pressure here?

26:01.201 --> 26:03.196
Yeah. Just here.

26:04.271 --> 26:05.869
All right. Thanks.

26:09.271 --> 26:11.270
Looks like we share
the latest fashion.

26:14.105 --> 26:15.109
I guess we do.

26:15.841 --> 26:16.880
Okay.

26:22.717 --> 26:23.788
[Kate] Oh!

26:25.290 --> 26:26.686
Voila!

26:26.821 --> 26:28.093
Thanks a million.

26:28.228 --> 26:29.288
All right.

26:30.955 --> 26:32.060
Okay.

26:35.703 --> 26:39.133
She's a great kid.
You must be proud.

26:40.338 --> 26:41.641
I am.

27:00.150 --> 27:01.155
Need some help?

27:02.989 --> 27:04.927
No, I'm okay.

27:05.063 --> 27:08.030
Relax, Sophie.
We're not going to do anything.

27:09.665 --> 27:10.670
Cross my heart.

27:13.202 --> 27:16.705
That was pretty mean
of us earlier.

27:16.841 --> 27:18.942
-I was a bitch.
-[girls laugh]

27:22.183 --> 27:23.078
It's okay.

27:24.244 --> 27:25.978
What are you doing after this?

27:26.113 --> 27:27.980
We have to go back to class.

27:28.115 --> 27:29.949
Not for another ten minutes.

27:30.085 --> 27:31.856
Do you want to have some fun?

27:33.757 --> 27:35.761
[indistinct chatter]

27:42.870 --> 27:45.236
Madame says
the chapel is off limits.

27:45.371 --> 27:46.398
[Simone] I know.

28:09.395 --> 28:11.126
[wood creaking]

28:39.019 --> 28:40.287
[distant clatter]

28:47.963 --> 28:48.834
[ominous music playing]

28:59.814 --> 29:02.910
-What are we doing here?
-Playing a game.

29:03.046 --> 29:06.115
It's called "Defy the Devil."

29:07.953 --> 29:11.186
-I don't see any devil.
-[girls scoff]

29:12.384 --> 29:14.683
The Devil is always here.

29:14.819 --> 29:17.192
You're just not looking
carefully enough.

29:20.958 --> 29:26.300
It depends on where you stand
and when you look.

29:28.202 --> 29:30.876
At the right time of day...

29:31.011 --> 29:36.011
the sun hits the glass
at just the right angle.

29:36.147 --> 29:38.515
And if you're watching
carefully,

29:38.750 --> 29:40.347
he looks right at you.

29:41.986 --> 29:44.914
The rumor is, if you look away,

29:45.050 --> 29:50.060
the Devil will appear in
the form of a monstrous goat.

29:56.167 --> 29:58.904
[whispering] See?
He's watching you.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.902
Whatever you do,

30:03.037 --> 30:05.376
whatever you hear,

30:05.511 --> 30:07.374
don't look away.

30:29.063 --> 30:31.101
[deep rumble]

30:37.477 --> 30:39.472
[heart thumping]

30:59.565 --> 31:01.230
[clatter]

31:03.163 --> 31:05.096
[breath exhaling]

31:05.232 --> 31:06.103
[intense music playing]

31:11.071 --> 31:12.340
[laughing]

31:15.081 --> 31:17.612
-[laughter]
-[pounding, shouting]

31:17.847 --> 31:19.107
Let me out!

31:19.243 --> 31:21.349
[crash]

31:22.951 --> 31:24.484
[creaking]

31:26.460 --> 31:28.026
[panting]

31:31.498 --> 31:34.362
[loud creaking]

31:40.507 --> 31:42.139
[rustling]

31:48.141 --> 31:49.146
[snarling]

31:56.023 --> 31:59.248
Sophie? What's going on?
What happened?

31:59.383 --> 32:01.290
[panting]

32:02.520 --> 32:05.030
Hey, hey. It's okay.

32:06.457 --> 32:07.494
What happened?

32:09.328 --> 32:10.827
What happened?

32:10.963 --> 32:13.163
Of course, her boyfriend comes
to her rescue.

32:13.299 --> 32:14.567
[girls laugh]

32:16.908 --> 32:18.307
Do you think it's funny?

32:21.141 --> 32:22.179
[yells] Do you?

32:31.989 --> 32:34.994
It's okay. It's over.

32:37.995 --> 32:39.328
What happened in there?

32:40.666 --> 32:42.034
You can tell me.

32:45.367 --> 32:47.006
-Nothing.
-[Kate] Sophie?

32:50.040 --> 32:51.907
Why aren't you in class?

32:52.043 --> 32:53.538
Oh, this isn't her fault.

32:53.674 --> 32:55.205
The older girls
were playing some--

32:55.340 --> 32:56.543
I'm sorry, Mom.

32:58.376 --> 32:59.447
Excuse us.

33:00.345 --> 33:01.916
[Maurice] Sure.

33:02.051 --> 33:03.187
Are you all right?

33:19.104 --> 33:20.268
[Sister Irene] Sister Astrid?

33:20.404 --> 33:21.330
[Sister Astrid]
Welcome to Tarascon.

33:21.465 --> 33:23.766
Please come in.

33:24.035 --> 33:27.307
We still have mass,
but no one comes.

33:27.443 --> 33:29.775
People believe
it was the Devil.

33:30.044 --> 33:34.548
They say our church is cursed,
that God has abandoned us.

33:48.627 --> 33:49.996
This is where we found him.

33:50.131 --> 33:52.104
[breath exhales]

33:54.171 --> 33:56.801
[footsteps echoing nearby]

34:00.076 --> 34:01.509
[door closes]

34:13.287 --> 34:14.159
[wind blowing]

34:39.479 --> 34:43.122
[door creaking open]

35:00.806 --> 35:03.005
[creaking]

35:03.140 --> 35:04.242
[Sister Debra] Sister?

35:08.375 --> 35:09.511
Are you okay?

35:12.213 --> 35:13.251
I'm fine.

35:17.756 --> 35:19.752
[Sister Debra] Can we see
Father Noiret's room, please?

35:21.489 --> 35:22.557
[Sister Astrid] Of course.

35:31.572 --> 35:32.501
Creepy.

35:33.831 --> 35:35.103
[Sister Irene] Saint Lucy.

35:35.239 --> 35:37.205
Patron Saint of the blind.

35:37.340 --> 35:38.639
She was murdered by pagans.

35:38.775 --> 35:40.642
They lit her on fire,
but she wouldn't burn.

35:40.777 --> 35:43.142
Before killing her,
they gouged out her eyes.

35:43.278 --> 35:44.573
[keys rattle]

35:44.709 --> 35:47.252
Found them. Please.

35:49.415 --> 35:50.717
[lock turns]

35:55.688 --> 35:57.691
[traffic rumbling outside]

36:00.257 --> 36:02.661
There was a boy that night?
A witness?

36:02.797 --> 36:05.402
Yes. Jacques.
He saw everything.

36:06.533 --> 36:07.768
Where can we find him?

36:07.903 --> 36:10.374
His mother doesn't want him
talking about it.

36:11.775 --> 36:14.640
But you might find him
playing football in town.

36:14.776 --> 36:16.748
Was there anyone else
in the church?

36:16.883 --> 36:18.413
We had a handyman.

36:18.548 --> 36:20.511
He left the day
after it happened.

36:20.647 --> 36:22.412
Do you know where he went?

36:22.548 --> 36:24.587
I don't know.

36:24.723 --> 36:28.192
But he was a world traveler.
He came from Romania.

36:28.328 --> 36:30.091
That is where he got
his nickname.

36:30.227 --> 36:32.425
They used to call him...

36:32.561 --> 36:33.925
-"Frenchie."
-Frenchie.

36:36.326 --> 36:37.929
[Sister Irene] Where are you
headed next?

36:38.164 --> 36:40.501
Well, I have enough money
to get me to Hungary,

36:40.637 --> 36:42.802
and from there,
the world is my oyster.

36:44.274 --> 36:46.168
At least Hungary is.

36:46.303 --> 36:49.371
-You saved my life.
-That? That was nothing.

36:49.507 --> 36:52.979
No, you've just fell into a...
what do you call it? Um...

36:53.248 --> 36:54.418
a life debt.

36:55.185 --> 36:56.619
It's very simple.

36:56.754 --> 36:59.918
You and I will be bound
together for all eternity.

37:02.424 --> 37:03.520
[train whistle blows]

37:03.656 --> 37:05.162
[conductor shouting]

37:05.297 --> 37:06.559
[Sister Irene] I almost forgot.

37:06.694 --> 37:09.532
It's nothing, just a thank you.

37:13.501 --> 37:15.801
Tomato seeds. Thank you.

37:15.936 --> 37:18.207
You said you wanted a farm
some day.

37:18.342 --> 37:19.608
You have to start somewhere.

37:21.876 --> 37:24.640
-I'll miss you, Irene.
-[whistle blows]

37:24.776 --> 37:26.780
[conductor shouting]

37:39.659 --> 37:40.629
[Sister Debra] Irene?

37:42.630 --> 37:44.336
Who is this Frenchie guy?

37:46.402 --> 37:48.570
His name is Maurice.

37:48.706 --> 37:50.837
Back at Saint Carta,
he was our guide.

37:50.972 --> 37:55.314
When I faced the demon,
he came back for me.

37:58.381 --> 37:59.549
<i> He saved my life.</i>

38:02.356 --> 38:04.723
[gasps] That's when
it happened.

38:04.858 --> 38:06.853
[screams]

38:09.756 --> 38:12.054
It's how the demon escaped.

38:12.323 --> 38:15.263
That's how it's moving,
doing these things.

38:15.398 --> 38:17.600
So, he's... possessed.

38:20.700 --> 38:22.704
[indistinct shouting]

38:28.409 --> 38:29.073
[Kate] Maurice.

38:30.675 --> 38:32.846
Hi. Hello again.

38:34.585 --> 38:37.212
I realized
I never said thank you.

38:37.348 --> 38:39.620
-Sophie told me what you did.
-Oh. No.

38:39.756 --> 38:42.457
Those girls
are little monsters.

38:42.592 --> 38:45.694
They're not all bad. Just some.

38:50.529 --> 38:53.905
Look... the chapel, why does
Madame keep it locked up?

38:54.041 --> 38:56.607
Uh, it's dangerous.

38:56.742 --> 38:59.543
Her son was killed inside
during the bombings.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.107
Cedric. He was an altar boy.

39:04.547 --> 39:06.248
I didn't know she had a son.

39:06.384 --> 39:07.915
She doesn't talk about it.

39:08.050 --> 39:11.918
Madame is a hard woman,
but she's been very good to us.

39:18.565 --> 39:21.631
Ah. I should get back
to the children.

39:21.766 --> 39:24.403
Sure, yes. And I should
get back to my work.

39:29.967 --> 39:31.938
[indistinct chatter]

39:45.123 --> 39:46.425
Caught you!

39:47.424 --> 39:49.392
What were you doing?

39:49.528 --> 39:51.925
-Nothing.
-You were spying.

39:53.594 --> 39:55.828
-Maybe.
-Maybe?

39:55.964 --> 39:58.629
Maybe, probably,
absolutely definitely.

39:58.764 --> 40:00.835
[Sophie chuckles]

40:00.970 --> 40:04.036
-What were you talking about?
-Nothing.

40:05.469 --> 40:07.842
It was something.
He was making you laugh.

40:09.041 --> 40:10.845
That is none of your business.

40:12.484 --> 40:15.619
Now, let's go. No more spying.

40:21.658 --> 40:22.828
-[crows cawing]
-[Maurice] Hey!

40:22.963 --> 40:24.793
[shooing]

40:33.865 --> 40:34.968
[Kate] Sophie?

40:40.881 --> 40:41.876
Mom?

40:50.685 --> 40:52.084
[footsteps upwards]

40:56.589 --> 40:57.496
Mom?

41:05.997 --> 41:08.672
[footsteps continues]

41:17.841 --> 41:18.781
Mom?

41:35.629 --> 41:37.635
[deep rumbling]

41:41.734 --> 41:43.740
[creaking]

41:46.078 --> 41:47.205
Mom?

42:12.238 --> 42:13.671
[Sophie gasps]

42:18.935 --> 42:20.942
[cawing]

42:29.847 --> 42:30.754
[gasps]

42:33.852 --> 42:35.790
[creaking]

42:35.925 --> 42:38.293

did you have a rosary?

but I can't place it.

57:27.581 --> 57:29.553

on one of the victims.

57:36.522 --> 57:37.528
Look.

57:38.427 --> 57:39.695
It's a connection.

57:47.736 --> 57:49.068
If we find out what this means,

57:49.203 --> 57:50.932
we might be able to find out
where it's headed.

57:51.068 --> 57:52.840
How are we gonna do that?

into the chapel.

I don't know why
she went in there last night.

01:00:36.237 --> 01:00:38.104
There's something wrong
with this school.

there's something here...

N-no.

01:01:05.866 --> 01:01:07.232
It's just a feeling.

Hey, it's okay to be scared.

01:01:14.037 --> 01:01:16.072
I'm scared, too.

01:01:16.208 --> 01:01:18.779

No one would buy it.

I've been speaking
to the Vatican.

01:02:35.985 --> 01:02:38.961
They tell me the demon
of Saint Carta has returned.

01:02:40.356 --> 01:02:41.990
It's a family crest.

01:02:42.126 --> 01:02:43.163
Whose family?

01:02:46.472 --> 01:02:49.332
Saint Lucy of Syracuse.

01:02:49.468 --> 01:02:52.209
These victims
must be her descendants.

01:02:52.344 --> 01:02:53.338
Saint Lucy?

01:03:00.081 --> 01:03:01.412
I think I know what it wants.

01:03:03.915 --> 01:03:04.822
What?

01:03:05.885 --> 01:03:07.248

01:03:07.383 --> 01:03:10.357
The eyes? W-What eyes?

01:03:10.492 --> 01:03:13.858
When Lucy was murdered
by pagans, her family escaped.

01:03:13.993 --> 01:03:15.261
They were hunted.

01:03:17.933 --> 01:03:19.529
Scattered across the globe.

01:03:19.764 --> 01:03:22.195
All this time, they've been
protecting a secret.

01:03:22.331 --> 01:03:23.335
A holy relic.

01:03:24.510 --> 01:03:26.437
The eyes of Saint Lucy.

01:03:29.344 --> 01:03:34.949
So, the demon
is after a... pair of eyes?

01:03:35.085 --> 01:03:38.582
-Why would it want that?
-It's a demon.

01:03:38.851 --> 01:03:42.189
I'm just a glorified librarian,
I couldn't begin to guess.

01:03:43.423 --> 01:03:47.263
But, if we're
sharing theories...

01:03:47.398 --> 01:03:52.298
you might like to consider that
this demon was once an angel.

01:03:56.298 --> 01:03:57.567
Rejected by God.

01:03:58.974 --> 01:04:00.273

01:04:00.408 --> 01:04:03.073
that God so casually
gave to His saints.

01:04:03.209 --> 01:04:04.979
It wants that power back.

[librarian]
Demons are infinite.

01:04:06.982 --> 01:04:08.348
It was there with Saint Lucy

01:04:08.483 --> 01:04:11.018
and it's been hunting
the bloodline ever since.

01:04:11.154 --> 01:04:14.155
This relic is an item
of great power.

01:04:14.290 --> 01:04:17.191
In the hands of a demon,
it would be unthinkable.

01:04:17.326 --> 01:04:19.854
But in your hands,
it could be a weapon.

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:23.324
Just as you used the blood
of Christ at Saint Carta.

01:04:23.460 --> 01:04:25.133
This is the way you do it.

01:04:26.929 --> 01:04:30.974
This is the way you send
that thing back to hell.

01:04:34.571 --> 01:04:36.111
We just don't know where it is.

01:04:38.141 --> 01:04:39.081

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:45.656

serves me correct,

01:04:45.925 --> 01:04:47.991

According to letters
that he wrote to the Vatican,

01:04:54.364 --> 01:04:57.462
he buried the eyes
somewhere within his monastery.

it's a boarding school.

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:17.383
[intense music playing]

01:05:27.366 --> 01:05:32.002
Irene, wait. Whatever happens
tonight, don't hesitate.

01:05:32.137 --> 01:05:34.495
We don't really know
what this relic can do.

01:05:34.630 --> 01:05:36.703
The same goes for the demon.

01:05:36.972 --> 01:05:39.000
<i> It will take any form,</i>

01:05:39.136 --> 01:05:42.209
<i> and it will choose its form</i>
<i> to prey on your fears,</i>

01:05:42.345 --> 01:05:44.940
<i> and the fears</i>
<i> of those around you.</i>

01:05:45.076 --> 01:05:48.678
<i> You must be prepared</i>
<i> to stop it, at all costs.</i>

01:06:00.496 --> 01:06:03.262
-What are you making?
-It's called feijoada.

01:06:03.398 --> 01:06:06.168
-It's a Portuguese stew.
-What's in it?

01:06:09.166 --> 01:06:10.172
Slugs.

01:06:12.005 --> 01:06:13.010
And snails.

01:06:26.185 --> 01:06:27.189
I lied to you.

01:06:28.516 --> 01:06:29.893
About what?

01:06:30.028 --> 01:06:31.688
I said I didn't remember
my mother.

01:06:33.631 --> 01:06:34.625
But I do.

01:06:37.564 --> 01:06:39.366
I remember everything
about her.

01:06:41.071 --> 01:06:43.469
<i> She was deeply religious.</i>

01:06:43.605 --> 01:06:45.907
<i> She said that God</i>
<i> spoke directly to her,</i>

01:06:46.043 --> 01:06:47.609
<i> that He showed her things.</i>

01:06:47.744 --> 01:06:48.705
<i> Visions.</i>

01:06:50.449 --> 01:06:51.312
Like me.

01:06:52.610 --> 01:06:54.584
My father didn't believe her.

01:06:54.720 --> 01:06:56.251
He said she was insane.

01:06:58.315 --> 01:06:59.348
Heretical.

01:06:59.483 --> 01:07:01.124
What happened to her?

01:07:02.391 --> 01:07:04.226
My father brought her
to a doctor.

01:07:06.396 --> 01:07:08.196
Then they came back
and took her away.

01:07:08.332 --> 01:07:10.727
-I will always be with you.

Mom, it's your turn.

01:07:49.432 --> 01:07:51.033
No, I shouldn't.

01:07:51.169 --> 01:07:52.274
Please?

01:07:56.779 --> 01:07:57.675
Please?

Yeah. It's... It's nothing.

in that direction.

looking for?

named Jean-Paul Redar.

through the window,

glow red.
