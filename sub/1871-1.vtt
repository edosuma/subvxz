WEBVTT

01:18.125 --> 01:24.325
Take it easy.

01:30.708 --> 01:32.039
Elder fellow brother, you've returned?

01:32.042 --> 01:35.785
Fellow brothers, why don't you use
your power together?

01:35.958 --> 01:38.199
A strange thing happened 3 days ago.

01:38.208 --> 01:39.744
So we dare not use our power together.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.865
What is it?

01:41.458 --> 01:42.743
Stop him!

01:42.875 --> 01:44.035
Don't let him go!

01:44.125 --> 01:46.366
Stop moving!

01:49.542 --> 01:51.783
Who are you? Where're you taking me?

01:51.792 --> 01:53.532
What do you want? Say!

01:53.542 --> 01:54.657
Catch him!

01:57.583 --> 01:59.949
Said he was eunuch wei of the ming dynasty.

02:07.708 --> 02:08.618
Your majesty?!

02:08.625 --> 02:12.447
Why don't you go down on your knees
when you see me?

02:12.792 --> 02:14.908
Your majesty, I'm very sorry.

02:15.083 --> 02:16.323
Catch him!

02:34.167 --> 02:35.953
Maybe he's really from the ming dynasty.

02:36.917 --> 02:40.865
You were beaten by the "Saint of gamblers"
in Hong Kong.

02:40.875 --> 02:43.036
That's why I came back.

02:45.292 --> 02:47.157
Four fellow brothers together...

02:47.167 --> 02:49.158
May help me to beat him.

02:49.167 --> 02:52.000
He's the disciple of "god of gamblers".
Somebody may help him.

02:52.042 --> 02:54.909
Don't worry. I've found a gang...

02:54.917 --> 02:56.999
Who will erase those who help him.

02:57.000 --> 02:59.867
The 5 of us will concentrate on beating
"Saint of gamblers".

03:00.125 --> 03:04.073
We'll help you to kill "Saint of gamblers".

03:14.375 --> 03:15.285
What do you want?

03:15.292 --> 03:17.749
Are you ready? We're waiting for you.

03:17.750 --> 03:18.865
Close the door.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.160
What?

03:22.250 --> 03:23.285
Let's get going.

03:25.292 --> 03:26.247
It's tight.

03:26.250 --> 03:29.447
I've told you not to eat
these a several times.

03:29.458 --> 03:31.824
You should behave yourself,
you're the "Saint of gamblers".

03:31.833 --> 03:33.243
That's why I hide in the washroom and eat.

03:33.250 --> 03:34.490
You're...

03:34.833 --> 03:37.620
Keep a cigar in your mouth.
It spells notability.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.323
Alright, alright.

03:39.542 --> 03:41.157
Where did you take your cigar?

03:41.333 --> 03:42.914
From my dad.

03:43.833 --> 03:48.281
Hello reporters, hello relatives.

03:48.292 --> 03:50.328
May I introduce to you

03:50.333 --> 03:54.281
this insurmountable, unbeatable...

03:54.292 --> 03:56.533
The wonderful partner of mine...

03:56.542 --> 04:01.036
The disciple of "god of gamblers"-
the " Saint of gamblers".

04:01.042 --> 04:02.498
Wonderful!

04:03.750 --> 04:05.035
This is not a good speech.

04:05.042 --> 04:06.452
I learn from my mentor.

04:06.458 --> 04:09.040
Great guys maintain low profile
when giving speeches.

04:09.167 --> 04:17.166
Ladies and gentlemen, I, Saint of gamblers

04:24.667 --> 04:28.706
Am extremely honoured to meet you.
Thank you.

04:28.708 --> 04:30.744
Wonderful!

04:31.542 --> 04:34.614
Besides having breakfast
daily with my mentor.

04:34.625 --> 04:37.742
I learn from him the art of the unbeatable.

04:37.750 --> 04:39.957
The most skilful part
of the art of winning.

04:39.958 --> 04:42.370
I can beat all opponents.

04:42.375 --> 04:44.707
I can beat all competitors.

04:44.708 --> 04:46.744
Show us your skill.

04:46.750 --> 04:48.490
I will. I must find an opponent.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.081
- I'll be the one.
- Great.

04:51.500 --> 04:53.331
Shuffle the cards yourselves. Watch.

04:53.333 --> 04:54.072
Come on.

04:54.083 --> 04:55.368
What is it?

04:55.500 --> 04:56.615
Here.

04:58.583 --> 04:59.572
I've got stomach ache.

04:59.583 --> 05:00.493
My stomach...

05:00.500 --> 05:03.412
- Here.
- It's alright.

05:03.625 --> 05:04.910
Something is wrong.

05:04.917 --> 05:05.497
What?

05:05.500 --> 05:06.990
Your throat.

05:07.000 --> 05:07.830
You've almost scared me.

05:07.833 --> 05:08.868
Here.

05:10.583 --> 05:11.789
There's an extra one.

05:11.792 --> 05:12.656
Fine.

05:12.667 --> 05:14.067
It's gallstone. You call that fine?

05:14.833 --> 05:16.824
What's this art?

05:16.833 --> 05:18.869
Didn't you learn the art of gambling
from "god of gamblers".

05:18.875 --> 05:21.287
This is one of the greatest art
of "god of gamblers".

05:21.292 --> 05:23.453
The art of massage on the sole.

05:24.458 --> 05:27.245
My mentor has given up all his leisure

05:27.250 --> 05:29.832
and taught me this skill,
so that I can help others.

05:29.833 --> 05:32.996
What a great man he is.

05:33.000 --> 05:36.072
This is an invaluable picture.
Please feel free to take photos.

05:36.125 --> 05:38.616
The art of massage on the sole?

05:38.625 --> 05:41.662
You've gone away 6 months.

05:41.667 --> 05:43.783
Haven't you learnt anything
from the god of gamblers?

05:44.125 --> 05:45.331
Yes.

05:45.333 --> 05:47.164
Yes.

05:47.167 --> 05:51.206
I collected rubbish in the backyard
of the "god of gamblers" every night.

05:52.667 --> 05:54.407
Bullshit!

05:54.458 --> 05:55.368
Hey! â€œWhat?

05:55.375 --> 05:56.911
- I'm hungry.
- Alright.

05:57.292 --> 05:58.782
Where's your shark fin?

05:58.792 --> 06:00.077
What do you want it for?

06:00.083 --> 06:02.495
Since you know the invaluable skill
of massaging on the sole.

06:02.500 --> 06:03.990
Have instant noodles instead.

06:04.958 --> 06:06.823
Can't I have some luncheon meat?

06:12.083 --> 06:14.415
Uncle, is it my birthday?

06:14.417 --> 06:15.532
No.

06:16.333 --> 06:18.574
What a big piece of meat this time.

06:19.667 --> 06:24.161
It's for celebrating our reunion.

06:24.542 --> 06:26.908
It takes me 5 meals to finish these.

06:27.250 --> 06:28.740
Is it too big?

06:29.375 --> 06:30.160
It doesn't matter.

06:30.167 --> 06:31.247
Mr. ding will give a speech.

06:31.250 --> 06:32.035
Don't eat too fast.

06:32.042 --> 06:32.827
Alright.

06:32.833 --> 06:37.372
I, ding lik,
am very glad to meet you in Shanghai.

06:37.417 --> 06:38.998
Is this the "Shanghai" show?

06:39.542 --> 06:41.248
Is it?

06:41.250 --> 06:42.456
Maybe!

06:43.667 --> 06:45.328
I like this name - ding lik!

06:45.333 --> 06:46.869
Who figure that out?

06:46.917 --> 06:50.455
There's a real person called ding lik then.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.949
He's a great friend of your grandpa.

06:52.958 --> 06:54.914
They started a business together.

06:55.417 --> 06:56.702
Really?

06:56.708 --> 06:57.788
Yes.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.077
What's the name of my grandpa?

06:59.083 --> 07:00.789
Chow tai fook.

07:00.917 --> 07:01.781
Really?

07:01.792 --> 07:02.577
Yes.

07:02.583 --> 07:06.246
Do I have a share
in the chow tai fook jewellery co.?

07:06.250 --> 07:09.367
The 2 chow tai fooks are not the same.

07:09.417 --> 07:12.989
Your grandpa and ding lik
sold buns together in Shanghai.

07:13.000 --> 07:16.322
Why did they sell buns
instead of jewellery?

07:16.333 --> 07:17.448
That's it.

07:17.458 --> 07:19.540
He's so stupid. He must look horrible.

07:19.583 --> 07:23.496
You're wrong. He's handsome.

07:23.500 --> 07:26.242
- Really?
- Look at the picture.

07:26.292 --> 07:28.874
This is your grandpa and your grandma.

07:28.875 --> 07:30.831
Nice looking, like me.

07:30.833 --> 07:31.948
Look exactly the same.

07:31.958 --> 07:32.697
Right.

07:32.708 --> 07:33.948
Damn!

07:34.458 --> 07:36.449
You look like this when you're old.

07:36.458 --> 07:37.413
I don't believe it.

07:37.417 --> 07:39.157
I didn't too.

07:45.583 --> 07:47.164
Reading blue magazines?

07:47.292 --> 07:48.292
Shut up!

07:48.417 --> 07:49.281
- What?
- My mentor told me

07:49.292 --> 07:51.999
this is the French "god of gamblers".

07:52.083 --> 07:53.698
A famous guy in Shanghai then.

07:53.708 --> 07:55.744
He was unbeatable then.

07:55.833 --> 07:56.743
That great?

07:56.750 --> 07:59.992
He gambled well, and he had special power.

08:00.208 --> 08:01.539
So he won every time?

08:01.542 --> 08:04.955
No. This book says...

08:06.125 --> 08:08.616
He was beaten once by a mysterious guy.

08:08.625 --> 08:11.037
Called "comment allez-vous".

08:11.042 --> 08:13.579
Strange name. I can't believe it.

08:16.708 --> 08:19.745
Hey! So you've come back to Hong Kong?

08:20.833 --> 08:23.791
The mentor has something to give me?
Fine, I'll wait for you.

08:24.083 --> 08:25.948
This is our ancestral house.

08:25.958 --> 08:27.448
Your grandpa passed it to me.

08:27.458 --> 08:29.039
I'll pass it to you.

08:29.042 --> 08:32.659
It's got a history of over 100 years.

08:32.667 --> 08:35.909
But it still stands here. Like me.

08:36.667 --> 08:38.407
You can't standing it.

08:38.417 --> 08:39.623
Shut up.

08:46.583 --> 08:51.282
I have a feeling that
we'll have a strange experience tonight.

08:51.542 --> 08:53.783
Something incredible will happen.

08:53.875 --> 08:55.081
What is it?

08:55.167 --> 08:56.247
No idea.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.410
Will you play a part?

08:57.417 --> 08:58.577
You decide.

08:58.667 --> 08:59.782
You should.

08:59.792 --> 09:00.952
You're smart.

09:09.125 --> 09:10.490
- This is a wonderful world.
- What?

09:10.500 --> 09:11.865
I heard that grandpa was shy.

09:11.875 --> 09:12.580
Correct.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.244
You never feel shy.

09:15.792 --> 09:17.874
That's what I am. What the hell can you do?

09:17.875 --> 09:20.082
Nothing. I admire you.

09:20.333 --> 09:23.040
Frankly, grandpa was so effeminate.

09:23.042 --> 09:25.124
But then he was able to find a woman,
my grandma.

09:25.125 --> 09:28.162
A son-of-a-bitch united them.

09:28.167 --> 09:29.407
Son-of-a-bitch?

09:39.083 --> 09:40.414
What did you see?

09:41.542 --> 09:43.908
Nothing. How about you?

09:43.958 --> 09:45.494
Me neither.

09:48.792 --> 09:50.657
Can you go inside and take a can...

09:51.042 --> 09:55.490
There're 5 here. Can you take them all?

09:55.500 --> 09:57.286
Let's do it together.

09:58.083 --> 10:02.656
As I expected, something
incredible happens.

10:02.667 --> 10:03.782
Damn it.

10:03.792 --> 10:05.828
I'm coming!

10:06.375 --> 10:10.994
Don't behave like that.
You'll scare them away.

10:16.208 --> 10:17.869
It's just an illusion. Let's go.

10:33.125 --> 10:34.205
What?

10:34.792 --> 10:36.282
You're always like this.

10:48.292 --> 10:50.203
Abracadabra, abracadabra!

10:55.125 --> 10:57.161
Objects move in this air. Amazing!

11:04.083 --> 11:05.448
Out!

11:14.042 --> 11:16.033
Why forcing me?

11:16.375 --> 11:20.414
Why? Why?

11:31.708 --> 11:32.948
Catch hold of him.

11:32.958 --> 11:34.289
I am.

11:34.292 --> 11:37.705
Boxing of the "Saint of gamblers".

11:41.750 --> 11:42.580
Are you alright?

11:42.583 --> 11:44.039
I've beaten you yp. Will your mouth foam?

11:44.042 --> 11:45.031
You're foaming at the mouth.

11:45.042 --> 11:46.407
- Me?
- Yes.

11:46.750 --> 11:47.455
Just saliva.

11:47.458 --> 11:49.164
Saliva? Call it piss.

11:49.167 --> 11:51.999
You kid, you're so weak.

11:52.000 --> 11:54.912
I'm old and am still fit
after somebody's giving me a punch.

11:54.917 --> 11:56.077
You threw up like hell last time.

11:56.083 --> 11:59.246
This time I haven't. I'd rather fall down.

11:59.250 --> 12:00.239
Are you alright?

12:00.250 --> 12:03.617
I'm falling down.

12:09.667 --> 12:10.873
What is burning?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.953
Me...

12:26.917 --> 12:28.157
It's burning.

12:34.750 --> 12:36.206
Water!

13:07.500 --> 13:08.706
Your majesty.

13:09.458 --> 13:12.655
This eunuch has beard.
His castration must be incomplete.

13:13.750 --> 13:14.535
Servants!

13:14.542 --> 13:15.452
Yes.

13:15.458 --> 13:17.323
Go castrate him again.

13:17.333 --> 13:17.867
Go!

13:17.875 --> 13:19.615
No! Your majesty!

13:19.625 --> 13:21.581
Don't castrate me, your majesty!

13:21.583 --> 13:24.120
Don't castrate me, don't...

13:24.625 --> 13:29.949
Don't castrate me, don't...

13:29.958 --> 13:30.947
Here!

13:30.958 --> 13:35.907
It's over! Give it back to me.
Give it back...

14:05.500 --> 14:06.364
Uncle!

14:06.375 --> 14:07.375
Brother five!

14:07.667 --> 14:08.247
Where's sing?

14:08.250 --> 14:10.332
He was with me.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.289
Then somebody hit me and I fainted.

14:12.375 --> 14:13.706
What do you want sing for?

14:13.917 --> 14:15.726
The "god of gamblers" wants him
to have this telephone.

14:15.750 --> 14:17.286
He'll call him over something urgent.

14:18.417 --> 14:19.202
What can we do?

14:19.208 --> 14:20.208
Look for him.

14:26.083 --> 14:27.414
Chow sing Cho!

14:29.125 --> 14:31.207
I knew it's you.

14:31.458 --> 14:33.494
You insulted me on the gambling boat.

14:33.500 --> 14:35.491
I am revenging this time.

14:36.208 --> 14:38.199
There's no end to revenging.

14:38.208 --> 14:41.450
I don't mind if you can revenge.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.915
But I'm afraid you'll lose again.

14:49.625 --> 14:51.661
If you're more powerful than me...

14:51.667 --> 14:54.079
It's me instead of you who's revenging.

14:57.500 --> 14:58.500
My god!

15:16.708 --> 15:19.745
The 5 of us will use our power together.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.786
You'll be dead.

15:31.375 --> 15:32.956
Sing! Sing!

15:33.208 --> 15:34.823
Don't come over here.

15:34.958 --> 15:37.870
Your mentor calls you.

15:38.875 --> 15:40.206
Go away.

15:40.208 --> 15:42.244
I'll say you're busy.

15:43.792 --> 15:47.580
Something has got me stuck...

17:07.791 --> 17:09.248
Uncle's telephone?

17:11.291 --> 17:11.997
Hello!

17:12.000 --> 17:13.240
What's happened?

17:13.250 --> 17:15.411
It's a long story. Where're you?

17:15.416 --> 17:18.374
In the police headquarters.
I'm invited here for a meeting.

17:18.375 --> 17:19.535
So much for this conversation.

17:19.541 --> 17:21.498
To deal with the robbers
with powerful arms...

17:21.625 --> 17:23.240
And you? Where're you?

17:23.250 --> 17:25.036
No idea. The new territories, maybe.

17:25.041 --> 17:25.781
I'm having a meeting!

17:25.791 --> 17:27.498
Give it to me!

17:27.500 --> 17:28.785
Brother five...

17:29.583 --> 17:31.164
Who's there interrupting?

17:31.167 --> 17:32.657
Me. Who are you?

17:32.667 --> 17:35.784
I'm chow sing Cho,
the "Saint of gamblers". And you?

17:35.792 --> 17:38.829
I'm commissioner wong,
nicknamed "scissors' legs".

17:38.833 --> 17:39.447
What legs?

17:39.458 --> 17:44.077
"Scissors' legs", they'll smash your head.

17:45.125 --> 17:47.457
Ask him to be smart
or his head will be smashed.

17:47.458 --> 17:49.494
Your friend is so cheeky.

17:49.500 --> 17:52.082
Sing, are you alright?

17:52.083 --> 17:54.324
I'm fine. Are you in the
police headquarters?

17:54.333 --> 17:56.574
I'll take a taxi and come to you.

17:56.583 --> 17:58.949
0o.k. See you later. Bye-bye!

17:59.167 --> 18:02.489
Ask him to be smart or I'll smash his head.

18:02.792 --> 18:03.872
Come in!

18:04.292 --> 18:06.078
Commissioner, have you used the phone?

18:06.083 --> 18:07.493
Can't I use it?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.866
All other phones broke
down while you're using one.

18:09.875 --> 18:12.116
That's the telephone company's business.

18:12.125 --> 18:13.706
Are you nuts?

18:37.750 --> 18:40.708
Excuse me. What is this place?

18:42.417 --> 18:43.497
I didn't mean it.

18:43.500 --> 18:46.697
Where can I take a taxi?

18:47.792 --> 18:48.656
Miss!

18:48.667 --> 18:50.999
Miss!...miss!

19:01.042 --> 19:02.031
Uncle.

19:02.042 --> 19:03.748
Uncle, what're you doing?

19:05.417 --> 19:07.533
Hey, are you crazy?

19:09.708 --> 19:11.994
Are you hanging yourself?

19:12.000 --> 19:15.037
What are you doing? What did you say?

19:20.417 --> 19:22.453
What are you doing?

19:22.750 --> 19:23.910
What are you doing?

19:23.917 --> 19:25.578
Get back down there first.

19:30.917 --> 19:33.784
Why lying on top of me? Shame to you.

19:34.625 --> 19:36.741
You're so effeminate,
and in such strange clothes.

19:36.750 --> 19:38.911
Have you gone crazy?

19:39.042 --> 19:40.248
I don't know what you're saying.

19:40.250 --> 19:43.162
You've interrupted my killing myself.

19:44.208 --> 19:46.369
Why do you want to kill yourself?

19:46.375 --> 19:48.115
I'm out of love the 37th time.

19:48.125 --> 19:49.410
You're always out of love.

19:49.417 --> 19:52.124
It's nothing to be out of love 37 times
in one's life.

19:52.125 --> 19:55.492
I'm out of love 37 times in a week.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.831
That's worth killing yourself.
I'll help you go up.

19:56.833 --> 19:58.869
I don't want to die now.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.491
You must be crazy. Stop kidding.

20:01.500 --> 20:02.990
Tell me, what's this place?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.865
What's happened? Uncle?

20:05.167 --> 20:07.658
Why calling me "uncle"? I'm so young.

20:07.667 --> 20:09.032
My name's chow tai fook.

20:09.250 --> 20:10.615
What's your job?

20:11.375 --> 20:12.831
I'm selling Shanghai buns.

20:22.500 --> 20:23.910
What's this board mean?

20:24.875 --> 20:26.661
No spitting around.

20:26.667 --> 20:29.329
What does "the Shanghai government" mean?

20:29.333 --> 20:31.039
This is Shanghai.

20:31.417 --> 20:32.247
This is Shanghai?

20:32.250 --> 20:33.250
Yes.

20:34.500 --> 20:36.115
The Shanghai where hui man-keung

20:36.125 --> 20:37.956
- and ding lik existed?
- Yes.

20:37.958 --> 20:39.869
But hui man-keung was shot last night.

20:39.875 --> 20:41.490
You mean he was dead in the t. V. Episode?

20:41.500 --> 20:44.412
No, it's in the news. Look.

20:45.042 --> 20:48.079
Hui man-keung was killed by 46 shots.

20:48.083 --> 20:51.325
July 19377 today is July 1937?

20:51.333 --> 20:52.573
Right. The year of the cow.

20:52.583 --> 20:55.040
Uncle! Uncle!

20:55.417 --> 20:56.976
- Who're you calling?
- Why don't you tremble?

20:57.000 --> 20:58.536
Why should I?

20:58.833 --> 20:59.993
Are you really my grandpa?

21:00.000 --> 21:01.240
Grandpa?

21:02.875 --> 21:04.581
You want to be my grandson?

21:04.792 --> 21:06.373
What's your name?

21:07.167 --> 21:09.328
Son-of-a-bitch!

21:09.750 --> 21:13.868
Mr. bitch. What is it?

21:14.708 --> 21:18.576
Damn it. So what I've heard is turn.

21:18.583 --> 21:20.119
What have you heard?

21:21.500 --> 21:24.492
The highest level of special power...

21:24.500 --> 21:26.957
Will change time and space.

21:27.333 --> 21:32.578
The person who uses special power
will travel back and forth in time.

21:32.958 --> 21:34.744
What are you saying?

21:36.125 --> 21:36.989
The phone!

21:37.042 --> 21:38.157
What phone?

21:38.917 --> 21:41.374
What's this? It's interesting.

21:46.000 --> 21:48.491
- Engaged.
- What is it?

21:48.750 --> 21:50.741
I must figure this out.

21:50.750 --> 21:51.750
Hey!

21:55.500 --> 21:57.411
Good grandson...

21:57.875 --> 22:01.367
Grandson...

22:01.833 --> 22:02.833
What is it?

22:03.792 --> 22:06.909
This is incredible.

22:07.083 --> 22:09.119
I can't believe this.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.832
Why not? I'm still unmarried.

22:11.833 --> 22:14.074
And I believe you're my grandson.

22:19.083 --> 22:20.948
Are the police coming?

22:20.958 --> 22:22.164
No idea.

22:24.417 --> 22:25.827
It's got nothing to do with me.

22:27.083 --> 22:28.539
Nothing to do with me.

22:28.875 --> 22:30.285
Over there!

22:30.625 --> 22:31.865
In red?

22:34.958 --> 22:36.619
You beat me up because I'm in red?

22:36.625 --> 22:39.742
Right! To revenge for brother keung.

22:42.042 --> 22:42.827
What?

22:42.833 --> 22:44.994
I'm not in red. I don't have to run.

22:45.875 --> 22:47.206
Then I'll stay here too.

22:47.208 --> 22:48.869
- Why?
- Because I'm a good fighter.

22:48.875 --> 22:49.705
Really?

22:49.708 --> 22:50.288
Really!

22:50.292 --> 22:51.532
Is that so?

22:51.625 --> 22:53.081
Great...

22:53.083 --> 22:54.744
Your grandson is a great fighter.

22:54.750 --> 22:55.239
Really?

22:55.250 --> 22:56.114
Right.

22:56.125 --> 22:56.784
Great! Great!

22:56.792 --> 22:59.249
I can beat 9 at a time.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.706
Great! Great!

23:00.875 --> 23:02.411
Why don't you sit down.

23:02.417 --> 23:03.577
Have a sugar cane, and watch me.

23:03.583 --> 23:04.789
Fine! Finel...

23:04.792 --> 23:05.406
0o.k.!

23:05.417 --> 23:06.702
What "k"?

23:09.375 --> 23:11.081
Wonderful!

23:11.083 --> 23:13.199
Wonderful!

23:25.500 --> 23:27.115
Prepare for the funeral.

23:27.458 --> 23:29.164
Fall down!

23:29.750 --> 23:32.583
Get to the hospital immediately. Stop!

23:32.792 --> 23:35.033
You'll get nothing by that.

23:40.750 --> 23:41.910
Grandson, finished your performance?

23:41.917 --> 23:43.498
Not yet, sit back first.

23:51.083 --> 23:53.699
Many guys in black over there.
Deal with them.

23:53.958 --> 23:55.448
It doesn't hurt when I
beat people up today.

23:55.458 --> 23:56.994
No, so what?

23:57.000 --> 23:57.955
You go!

23:57.958 --> 23:59.164
Fine.

24:03.458 --> 24:05.665
I'll finish this one,
you go for the others.

24:05.667 --> 24:06.782
Fine.

24:09.625 --> 24:12.207
Who, are you? Why don't I know you?

24:12.292 --> 24:14.283
Because I'm your senior.

24:14.292 --> 24:15.577
The secret code!

24:15.583 --> 24:16.413
What secret code?

24:16.417 --> 24:18.954
Listen. Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.

24:18.958 --> 24:20.994
High up in the world above. What's next?

24:21.000 --> 24:23.241
Like a diamond in the sky.

24:23.250 --> 24:25.536
Wrong, it's London bridge is falling down.

24:25.542 --> 24:27.874
I don't get it.

24:27.958 --> 24:29.198
Damn it.

24:29.667 --> 24:31.578
Change the colour and it'll be fine.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.448
It's lucky that grandpa
has gone away early.

24:33.458 --> 24:35.164
Should've known that.

24:38.667 --> 24:39.998
The guys in red have it now.

24:40.000 --> 24:41.206
Yes, yes.

24:41.208 --> 24:42.869
It maybe fine.

24:43.208 --> 24:44.118
What can we do?

24:44.125 --> 24:46.992
Walk slowly and we won't alert them.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.285
But we're in black.

24:48.292 --> 24:50.123
They won't know if you don't tell.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.081
- Really?
- Kill him!

25:41.542 --> 25:42.782
- Does it hurt?
- Yes.

25:42.792 --> 25:43.952
It's strange.

25:47.750 --> 25:49.615
The kung-fu of "in-between"?

25:53.458 --> 25:56.165
The more in between the
more powerful it is.

25:58.125 --> 26:00.491
So this is the lost
kung-fu of "in-between".

26:00.500 --> 26:01.865
Disperse!

26:09.292 --> 26:11.078
You should let one stay in between.

26:25.958 --> 26:29.371
You still want to run?

26:33.792 --> 26:35.999
Big brother, are you alright?

26:36.000 --> 26:37.536
Are you alright?

26:38.583 --> 26:41.370
Nine in between. You're
in trouble this time.

26:48.167 --> 26:51.739
Can't reach the end of the street. Damn it.

26:54.708 --> 26:57.541
Big brother... are you alright?

26:57.542 --> 26:59.407
Big brother, big brother...

27:08.000 --> 27:09.115
Where's tiger lui?

27:09.125 --> 27:10.740
He's dead!

27:11.250 --> 27:12.535
Here!

27:12.542 --> 27:14.032
Who killed him?

27:14.458 --> 27:15.948
I don't know...

27:24.583 --> 27:26.369
Mr. ding, tiger lui is dead.

27:27.333 --> 27:28.163
How?

27:28.167 --> 27:30.283
A kid killed him by a punch.

27:30.458 --> 27:32.744
Good grandson, are you alright?

27:32.958 --> 27:34.243
Ding lik, ding lik!

27:34.250 --> 27:35.581
The boss ding?

27:39.375 --> 27:40.831
Mr. ding, how are you?

27:41.125 --> 27:45.494
Buddy, thank you for
revenging for brother man.

27:45.792 --> 27:48.864
Brother man? You mean hui man-keung?

27:50.000 --> 27:53.492
He was killed by tiger lui yesterday.

27:54.292 --> 27:55.452
Serves him right.

27:55.458 --> 27:58.200
I said it serves tiger lui right.

27:59.417 --> 28:01.499
I've sent a lot of men
here for the revenge.

28:01.500 --> 28:02.740
But I can't find him.

28:03.583 --> 28:06.120
You did it. Smart young man.

28:06.125 --> 28:07.490
Somebody dead here?

28:07.500 --> 28:09.286
Mr. ding, the guys are checking around.

28:09.375 --> 28:12.572
Ching, you finish him off.
We go home first.

28:12.583 --> 28:13.583
Yes.

28:16.792 --> 28:19.249
We can just walk away
when so many are dead?

28:19.375 --> 28:20.831
This is Shanghai!

28:30.708 --> 28:34.246
I've sworn that anybody who revenges
for brother man.

28:35.667 --> 28:37.532
Can have 3 wishes come true.

28:37.833 --> 28:40.620
I've got only one wish left.

28:40.625 --> 28:42.581
To return to Hong Kong in 1991.

28:42.583 --> 28:44.119
No, no...

28:44.125 --> 28:47.322
You said you came from Hong Kong 1991.

28:47.750 --> 28:49.661
This is incredible.

28:57.458 --> 29:00.040
You can't find this watch in your time.

29:00.042 --> 29:01.077
And...

29:02.083 --> 29:04.574
This is a mobile phone, a product for 1991.

29:04.583 --> 29:06.039
You call this a phone?

29:06.250 --> 29:08.130
I'll believe you if
somebody answers your call.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.740
I can even let you speak to them.

29:12.417 --> 29:14.408
Show me.

29:15.625 --> 29:16.740
Still engaged.

29:17.875 --> 29:20.082
But you can hear it.

29:20.083 --> 29:21.414
Somebody speaking english.

29:24.333 --> 29:26.915
It's just something making a strange noise.

29:26.917 --> 29:28.578
You can't prove it's a telephone.

29:31.667 --> 29:33.828
I've really talked to somebody
in 1991 through it.

29:33.833 --> 29:35.869
It's just being engaged.

29:37.083 --> 29:39.540
I'll show you later.

29:40.083 --> 29:42.665
It doesn't matter from when you came.

29:43.958 --> 29:46.665
Even if you really come from h.K. 1991.

29:46.750 --> 29:48.706
Now that you're in Shanghai, 1937.

29:48.792 --> 29:50.373
There's no way back.

29:50.958 --> 29:52.289
Why not stay and help me?

29:52.833 --> 29:54.573
Good! Good!

29:54.583 --> 29:58.747
Grandson, thank Mr. ding
for thinking highly of you.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.285
That means I have to join the traids?

30:00.292 --> 30:02.658
Everybody in Shanghai is a triad member.

30:02.667 --> 30:05.283
Everybody! He, you, me.

30:05.583 --> 30:06.447
You're not.

30:06.458 --> 30:07.493
I am!

30:07.500 --> 30:09.866
You're effeminate. You
can't be a triad member.

30:10.833 --> 30:11.868
Come back!

30:13.375 --> 30:18.119
I hate people saying that I'm effeminate.

30:18.292 --> 30:19.077
You are.

30:19.083 --> 30:20.619
I'm a triad member.

30:20.708 --> 30:21.993
So you're an effeminate triad member.

30:22.000 --> 30:24.707
No! I'm the top killer
of the triad society.

30:25.583 --> 30:26.538
Look at him.

30:26.542 --> 30:29.705
No. I'm a triad top killer.

30:29.708 --> 30:30.993
O.k. You're a top killer.

30:31.000 --> 30:32.080
And you're an effeminate top killer.

30:32.083 --> 30:33.914
No, I'm not effeminate.

30:33.917 --> 30:34.952
- You are!
- I'm not!

30:34.958 --> 30:36.323
I hate people calling me effeminate.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.493
Don't call me effeminate.

30:37.500 --> 30:38.740
You really are.

30:39.083 --> 30:40.789
What are you doing?

30:40.792 --> 30:42.874
Listen to me!

30:43.000 --> 30:45.491
You're extremely effeminate.

30:45.500 --> 30:47.536
Face it!

30:48.583 --> 30:49.948
I'm a triad member.

30:50.292 --> 30:50.906
What a nuisance!

30:50.917 --> 30:51.997
I'm really a triad member.

30:52.000 --> 30:53.456
Throw him onto the street, please.

30:53.458 --> 30:55.915
Throw him out.

30:55.917 --> 30:56.997
Yes, Mr. ding!

30:57.000 --> 30:58.661
Don't come closer or I'll beat you.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.283
Grandson, help!

31:01.333 --> 31:02.573
No! I didn't mean it.

31:02.583 --> 31:05.325
You should mean what you say to me.

31:06.208 --> 31:07.539
This is your first wish.

31:07.542 --> 31:11.364
Hold it! I want him to be healthy.

31:11.375 --> 31:12.239
Fine.

31:12.250 --> 31:13.535
Let him off!

31:14.417 --> 31:15.076
Please!

31:15.083 --> 31:16.448
This is your second wish.

31:17.583 --> 31:20.245
What an egghead! You've wasted 2 wishes.

31:20.250 --> 31:23.367
Tell us your third wish.

31:24.417 --> 31:26.032
I wish we have a lot of jewellery.

31:26.042 --> 31:26.827
A lot of beautiful women.

31:26.833 --> 31:28.414
A lot of macho guys to protect us.

31:28.417 --> 31:29.702
4 Mercedes.

31:30.417 --> 31:33.079
Greed will get you nowhere.

31:33.083 --> 31:34.368
Mr. ding, it's simple.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.616
My wish is that I can have 3 more wishes.

31:37.542 --> 31:41.455
Good! Greed is the driving force for man.

31:41.708 --> 31:43.414
I like greedy guys like you.

31:43.708 --> 31:45.869
Better than hypocrites.

31:49.875 --> 31:51.456
Hold this gold coin.

31:51.625 --> 31:53.991
Return it to me when you're in need.

31:54.042 --> 31:55.498
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

31:56.750 --> 31:58.490
What's your name?

31:58.500 --> 31:59.706
Son-of-a-bitch!

32:00.875 --> 32:01.660
You're called son-of-a-bitch?

32:01.667 --> 32:04.033
Damn you, my name's chow sing Cho!

32:04.792 --> 32:07.499
Sing, stay in Shanghai,

32:07.833 --> 32:11.496
you can become a great
personage in Shanghai.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.410
What do you say?

32:13.417 --> 32:14.827
Since you're so greedy.

32:16.083 --> 32:17.698
Thanks. But, Mr. ding,

32:18.000 --> 32:19.831
I don't want to be
a great personage in Shanghai.

32:19.833 --> 32:21.994
You must believe what I've said,

32:22.000 --> 32:23.740
I only want to be back to my time.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.832
I must figure out a way to go back...

32:25.833 --> 32:28.825
Sing, let it be.

32:29.417 --> 32:32.864
We'll talk it over
after man's funeral tomorrow.

32:38.792 --> 32:39.827
Nobody answers?

32:40.875 --> 32:43.912
Are you kidding?
Always engaged in these 2 days?

32:43.917 --> 32:45.623
What exactly is this?

32:47.333 --> 32:48.539
I don't know why...

32:51.208 --> 32:52.448
I want to piss.

32:54.083 --> 32:58.031
Be patient, there's not even a tree around.

32:59.292 --> 33:01.157
I've been very patient, but its unbearable.

33:02.000 --> 33:04.082
I've got a treasure handed
down in our family.

33:04.083 --> 33:06.449
- It can cure your desire to piss.
- Really?

33:06.458 --> 33:07.914
- Yes.
- Give it to me, quick!

33:11.542 --> 33:13.498
I've been using it since I was a kid.

33:14.625 --> 33:18.493
Mr. ding, the mayor and miss yu-San arrive.

33:34.333 --> 33:35.618
I've seen her before.

33:35.625 --> 33:36.625
What is it?

33:37.167 --> 33:38.727
The treasure handed down in our family.

33:39.083 --> 33:40.243
Is it nice?

33:40.458 --> 33:42.574
I've seen the girl in
black with a hat before.

33:42.583 --> 33:43.572
When?

33:43.583 --> 33:44.663
Before you hanged yourself.

33:44.667 --> 33:45.952
I've seen her before,
though she looks different now.

33:45.958 --> 33:47.573
But it's the same person.

33:47.625 --> 33:48.284
So what?

33:48.292 --> 33:49.292
Nothing.

33:53.667 --> 33:57.706
I'm sorry about Mr. hui.

33:58.458 --> 34:00.289
What a loss to us.

34:00.375 --> 34:01.581
Thank you mayor.

34:01.583 --> 34:04.825
Please don't call me mayor.

34:06.250 --> 34:06.830
Yu-San!

34:06.833 --> 34:07.833
Lik!

34:14.958 --> 34:18.780
Let me introduce you to my new friend.

34:18.917 --> 34:20.578
Where is he?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.447
Sing, come here.

34:22.792 --> 34:23.792
Yes.

34:24.000 --> 34:25.489
He revenged for brother man,

34:25.500 --> 34:28.286
the hero who killed tiger lui.

34:29.125 --> 34:30.331
Mr. chow, nice to meet you.

34:30.333 --> 34:32.870
We know each other.

34:33.250 --> 34:34.364
You know each other?

34:34.375 --> 34:36.706
Mr. chow, I'm afraid I don't know you.

34:36.833 --> 34:39.119
Remember the riverside last time?

34:39.125 --> 34:42.081
Yu-San is the daughter of the mayor.

34:42.083 --> 34:42.697
Mayor!

34:42.708 --> 34:43.743
My best friend.

34:43.750 --> 34:44.489
Really?

34:44.500 --> 34:46.706
She doesn't seem to know you.

34:46.708 --> 34:48.322
Mr. ding, wong kam-kwai arrives.

34:55.542 --> 34:56.952
What is this guy?

34:56.958 --> 34:58.619
A hypocrite!

34:59.875 --> 35:05.165
He's the sworn brother of tiger lui.

35:05.167 --> 35:06.873
The enemy of ding lik.

35:06.875 --> 35:10.242
He's the man behind the
death of hui man-keung.

35:10.417 --> 35:12.749
I'm sorry I'm late, Mr. ding!

35:12.750 --> 35:15.913
It's alright. Nobody here will mind.

35:17.583 --> 35:20.120
Mr. ding, you're indeed frank.

35:20.375 --> 35:22.616
I want to talk business with you.

35:22.667 --> 35:24.828
I hope it's not the one
you talked with man.

35:26.042 --> 35:29.079
A Japanese spy admires your talent.

35:29.250 --> 35:32.697
Hui man-keung is a fool.
Mr. ding, you are clever.

35:32.958 --> 35:36.826
I think you know how to
seize the opportunity.

35:37.833 --> 35:39.573
His looks tell he's a cunning guy.

35:39.583 --> 35:41.323
His mouth betrays his words.

35:41.333 --> 35:43.164
Go and tell the Japanese,

35:43.458 --> 35:46.200
I, ding lik, will never betray my country.

35:46.208 --> 35:48.574
Don't make me force you.

35:48.792 --> 35:50.498
Don't make me force you.

35:50.500 --> 35:52.411
How dare you talk to me like that!

35:52.417 --> 35:54.499
Ha! Hal...

35:54.583 --> 35:56.574
Ha! Hal...

35:56.958 --> 35:57.993
Good! Let's go!

35:58.042 --> 35:59.828
Good! Let's go!

36:03.708 --> 36:06.165
You're great, you know
what he wants to say.

36:06.292 --> 36:08.078
There's a standard formal
for cunning guys' words.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.165
All t.V. Episodes in our time show that.

36:19.292 --> 36:20.577
Go! Mr. ding!

36:26.333 --> 36:28.614
Hairy, you protect Mr. ding.
I'll shield you against them.

36:40.958 --> 36:42.073
Danger!

36:46.792 --> 36:48.498
Very dangerous, don't move.

36:51.292 --> 36:54.534
Hairy! Hairy!

36:55.333 --> 36:58.951
Mr. ding, machine guns are
in the rocks over there.

37:04.792 --> 37:06.407
Over there, kill him!

37:10.083 --> 37:11.619
Try and rescue brother lik!

37:11.625 --> 37:13.456
Don't worry, nobody can hurt him.

37:16.208 --> 37:19.905
Nobody can see him... nobody can see him.

37:21.792 --> 37:22.406
How come?

37:22.417 --> 37:23.417
I can't see him.

37:26.750 --> 37:27.739
How about over there?

37:27.750 --> 37:28.364
No.

37:28.375 --> 37:29.831
Over here?

37:40.167 --> 37:41.167
How are you?

37:41.750 --> 37:43.365
I've overused my power.

37:43.625 --> 37:45.581
Good grandson, good grandson...

37:46.000 --> 37:47.206
How are you?

37:48.167 --> 37:50.954
Good grandson!

37:54.792 --> 37:56.453
- Fine, no...
- Don't be afraid!

37:56.458 --> 37:57.288
Don't go...

37:57.292 --> 37:59.533
I won't go...

38:01.083 --> 38:01.788
You've seen a ghost?

38:01.792 --> 38:02.792
Damn you!

38:05.083 --> 38:06.118
How are you?

38:06.917 --> 38:08.407
I'm sick.

38:11.333 --> 38:12.789
Do you really know magic?

38:12.792 --> 38:15.989
You've made them impossible
to see Mr. ding.

38:16.875 --> 38:21.699
This is called...

38:26.208 --> 38:28.950
If I say I know magic, will you believe me?

38:29.208 --> 38:30.038
I willl

38:30.042 --> 38:31.373
- will you?
- Yes.

38:31.375 --> 38:34.082
I come from another age,
will you believe me?

38:34.083 --> 38:34.697
Yes.

38:34.708 --> 38:36.118
How about I'm your grandson?

38:36.125 --> 38:36.830
I believe you too.

38:36.833 --> 38:39.290
Don't you think this is very stupid?

38:39.292 --> 38:40.327
Extremely stupid.

38:40.333 --> 38:40.992
So you believe it?

38:41.000 --> 38:42.240
I do.

38:42.292 --> 38:43.156
Why?

38:43.167 --> 38:49.288
I don't know. I liked you
the first time I saw you.

38:49.292 --> 38:50.828
You won't hurt me.

38:52.083 --> 38:53.539
- Really?
- Really!

38:54.083 --> 38:56.870
I won't hurt you
because you're indeed my grandpa.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.080
Good grandson!

38:59.250 --> 39:00.250
Grandpa!

39:00.708 --> 39:01.948
Good grandson!

39:02.792 --> 39:03.952
Grandpa!

39:07.833 --> 39:09.039
Where's miss yu-San?

39:09.083 --> 39:13.031
She's gone. She said she didn't know you.

39:15.583 --> 39:18.325
Impossible. Maybe she's shy to admit.

39:19.292 --> 39:22.125
Damn you. You're in love.

39:23.208 --> 39:26.245
Stop talking nonsense.

39:26.250 --> 39:29.617
You are. Your looks betray you.

39:29.625 --> 39:30.159
Really?

39:30.167 --> 39:31.202
Indeed!

39:32.333 --> 39:33.618
Can you tell now?

39:33.625 --> 39:34.956
No difference!

39:34.958 --> 39:36.573
- How about this?
- Even more so!

39:36.917 --> 39:38.407
I think this is fine.

39:38.500 --> 39:40.491
This is the worst.

39:40.875 --> 39:43.287
So miss yu-San can tell too.

39:43.292 --> 39:44.372
Of course she can.

39:44.375 --> 39:47.037
Well, I have to remove all obstacles.

39:47.042 --> 39:50.614
Clear all enemies, and...

39:51.458 --> 39:52.538
Date her!

39:54.833 --> 39:55.822
Hold it! Hold it!

39:55.833 --> 39:56.868
Why?

39:56.875 --> 39:59.036
I should figure out how
to return to my time.

39:59.042 --> 40:00.578
Stop worrying too much!

40:00.583 --> 40:01.368
Have you figured out?

40:01.375 --> 40:01.955
Not yet.

40:01.958 --> 40:03.539
Then date her first.

40:03.708 --> 40:04.618
Not yet.

40:04.625 --> 40:05.785
Why?

40:05.792 --> 40:09.364
Mr. ding is so kind
to start a business.

40:09.500 --> 40:12.867
And he's so fond of miss yu-San.

40:12.875 --> 40:13.739
If I date her...

40:13.750 --> 40:17.538
Don't be silly. It's fair to compete.

40:17.542 --> 40:18.622
What's more important.

40:18.625 --> 40:19.364
What?

40:19.375 --> 40:21.366
You're too ugly to date her.

40:29.917 --> 40:33.159
Father, I've sinned.

40:34.583 --> 40:36.869
Everybody is a sinner.

40:37.250 --> 40:39.866
But I want to commit sin now.

40:39.958 --> 40:42.074
And I can't help it.

40:42.250 --> 40:45.993
Pray and ask god to give you strength,

40:46.000 --> 40:47.536
so that you can help yourself.

40:47.542 --> 40:50.409
If I really commit a sin,

40:50.708 --> 40:51.948
will god forgive me?

40:51.958 --> 40:56.327
If you've sinned and
if you regret it sincerely,

40:56.333 --> 40:58.039
god will surely forgive you.

40:59.542 --> 41:00.873
That ease my mind.

41:04.333 --> 41:05.539
Don't you think

41:05.542 --> 41:06.942
- it's crowded in here?
- I'm sorry!

41:11.792 --> 41:13.032
How's it going? Alright?

41:13.042 --> 41:17.411
Everything's alright.

41:17.667 --> 41:20.124
Does miss yu-San come
here at this time daily?

41:20.125 --> 41:21.331
Yes, she's coming.

41:26.042 --> 41:27.452
Start, start!

41:37.125 --> 41:38.331
Thanks, father!

41:38.875 --> 41:40.285
You're coming for a confession?

41:40.292 --> 41:43.455
This father is really great.

41:43.458 --> 41:45.494
I'll leave you too alone.

41:46.792 --> 41:48.999
Spring, wait for me outside.

41:49.000 --> 41:50.000
Yes.

41:56.333 --> 41:58.745
Father, I've sinned.

42:02.250 --> 42:04.332
Everybody is a sinner.

42:04.750 --> 42:07.867
Father, your voice has changed.

42:08.875 --> 42:12.914
I dreamt and saw god last night.

42:12.917 --> 42:16.364
And I saw holy Mary too.

42:16.375 --> 42:19.287
We've talked a lot and my throat is sore.

42:19.292 --> 42:20.452
We've talked about you.

42:20.458 --> 42:21.493
Me?

42:22.458 --> 42:24.574
You are a fallen angel.

42:24.917 --> 42:29.411
You have to choose the right man for you.

42:29.792 --> 42:32.124
And he's already there.

42:32.125 --> 42:35.162
Have I seen him?

42:35.167 --> 42:38.705
Yes, he's rescued you once.

42:39.042 --> 42:43.331
Have you noticed a handsome man
who's rescued you?

42:43.333 --> 42:46.825
A handsome man? No!

42:47.083 --> 42:49.620
The one who rescued me looks stupid.

42:49.625 --> 42:52.822
He looks quite handsome
and a little stupid.

42:52.833 --> 42:55.324
You're destined to love him.

42:55.333 --> 42:57.995
Don't make god disappointed.

43:01.625 --> 43:02.410
What is it here?

43:02.417 --> 43:05.784
Sing is great in dating girls.

43:05.792 --> 43:08.499
Miss yu-San believes him completely.

43:09.125 --> 43:10.865
Isn't it father who's inside?

43:10.875 --> 43:12.456
Of course not!

43:19.500 --> 43:22.287
You two will have 7 sons and 8 daughters.

43:22.292 --> 43:26.285
You'll live in jardine's
lookout in Hong Kong.

43:26.292 --> 43:27.372
You'll have 5 cars...

43:27.375 --> 43:30.867
Father, your dream's
getting longer and longer.

43:30.875 --> 43:34.447
Believe me and you'll be fine.

43:34.583 --> 43:37.780
The one inside isn't the father.

43:38.167 --> 43:39.873
Let me finish.

43:42.458 --> 43:43.072
Who is it?

43:43.083 --> 43:44.289
I want to sit inside.

43:44.292 --> 43:45.657
No, it's crowded in here.

43:46.500 --> 43:49.697
You sex maniac, disguise as the father?

43:49.833 --> 43:52.119
Who's the sex maniac? Is it you?

43:52.125 --> 43:53.615
Stop pretending.

43:56.083 --> 43:57.414
Spring, let's go.

43:58.292 --> 43:59.452
Miss yu-San!

44:00.542 --> 44:02.954
Sorry, I didn't mean it...

44:02.958 --> 44:05.370
I won't tell this to Mr. ding.

44:05.375 --> 44:06.364
Thank you so much. Thanks.

44:06.375 --> 44:08.536
But this won't happen again.

44:11.500 --> 44:12.455
Good grandson!

44:12.458 --> 44:14.289
We're getting too far.

44:14.292 --> 44:16.704
I've got kicked because of this.

44:16.708 --> 44:18.619
I like her.

44:18.625 --> 44:19.159
Who?

44:19.167 --> 44:20.703
The one who kicked me.

44:21.375 --> 44:22.615
So what?

44:23.208 --> 44:24.664
I think it's hopeless.

44:56.750 --> 44:59.708
My casino is very popular
in these 10 years.

44:59.917 --> 45:02.033
If you don't mind come and help me.

45:02.042 --> 45:03.373
0.k., oh, no, Mr. ding.

45:06.375 --> 45:07.205
Small!

45:07.208 --> 45:09.199
Large 18 times. Why bet on small?

45:10.583 --> 45:15.373
I can see through that.

45:16.500 --> 45:20.664
14 points, large.

45:22.500 --> 45:26.914
I want to lose, Mr. ding, would you mind?

45:26.917 --> 45:28.032
Fine, come on.

45:29.750 --> 45:32.992
Sing!

45:33.000 --> 45:34.456
What's so exciting?

45:34.833 --> 45:36.698
What if I don't tell you?

45:36.708 --> 45:37.117
No.

45:37.125 --> 45:38.535
So I don't tell you, sing!

45:38.542 --> 45:41.989
14 points, large.

45:42.083 --> 45:43.493
Does he really see through it?

45:43.500 --> 45:44.500
Mr. ding!

45:46.500 --> 45:47.910
Congratulations! Congratulations!

45:47.917 --> 45:49.309
I'm honoured to have the mayor here.

45:49.333 --> 45:50.368
It's my pleasure.

45:52.833 --> 45:53.833
Sing!

45:54.833 --> 45:57.666
How come the two of them are here?

45:59.833 --> 46:01.073
Never mind.

46:01.458 --> 46:03.323
I've talked it over with wong kam-kwai.

46:03.333 --> 46:06.075
He denied everything between you and him
in the cemetery.

46:06.708 --> 46:07.993
I expected that.

46:08.583 --> 46:10.699
Mr. ding, wong kam-kwai's here.

46:11.208 --> 46:13.164
Congratulations, Mr. ding!

46:13.667 --> 46:17.910
I wish your casino every success.

46:18.000 --> 46:19.490
You're not welcome in here.

46:20.417 --> 46:23.454
You can refuse me.

46:23.833 --> 46:25.619
But you can't refuse...

46:25.625 --> 46:29.994
Our Japanese vip.

46:38.333 --> 46:39.948
Nice to meet you, Mr. ding!

46:40.000 --> 46:44.198
You're indeed very talented, madam.

46:44.250 --> 46:45.250
I'm impressed.

46:47.000 --> 46:48.786
Thanks! Thanks!

46:54.292 --> 46:57.534
I'm so tired. I can't stand it.

46:58.250 --> 47:02.289
I just thought her kung fu is great
but found that it was her stand-in.

47:04.458 --> 47:05.618
Stay aside!

47:06.333 --> 47:08.949
Mr. ding, I'm being direct.

47:08.958 --> 47:11.290
You want your casino to make money.

47:11.292 --> 47:13.408
And I want to win money.

47:13.417 --> 47:14.623
What do you want to bet on?

47:14.667 --> 47:15.667
Large-small.

47:16.583 --> 47:18.790
How many chips can I exchange
for 2 boxes of gold?

47:20.292 --> 47:22.408
Give her 10 million francs.

47:22.417 --> 47:23.623
Yes.

47:24.000 --> 47:27.288
Sing, wake up!

47:28.792 --> 47:30.578
Please, madam.

47:31.625 --> 47:32.660
Tai-kun!

47:41.542 --> 47:43.658
8 points, small!

47:43.667 --> 47:45.749
All bet small.

47:46.250 --> 47:48.081
8 points, small!

47:53.250 --> 47:55.366
She's won! Shake well!

48:09.833 --> 48:12.245
1, 2, 3. 6 points, small!

48:12.792 --> 48:13.792
Open!

48:14.167 --> 48:15.998
1, 2, 3. 6 points, small!

48:18.417 --> 48:19.452
She's won!

48:20.250 --> 48:22.707
Mr. ding, we've got to find a solution.

48:22.792 --> 48:24.783
It seems he can see through it.

48:25.583 --> 48:29.030
What? Try and wake sing!

48:29.042 --> 48:30.042
Yes.

48:30.917 --> 48:32.498
Sing, sing!

48:32.500 --> 48:34.331
This is the most powerful awakening pill.

48:34.333 --> 48:36.449
Anybody can wake after taking it.

48:36.458 --> 48:38.665
Give it to him, quick.

48:38.833 --> 48:41.245
Wakel...

48:42.500 --> 48:43.205
He's awake.

48:43.208 --> 48:43.913
What is it?

48:43.917 --> 48:44.576
A guy outside

48:44.583 --> 48:46.369
- has won a lot of money.
- Is he?

48:47.208 --> 48:48.448
Tai-kun!

48:49.000 --> 48:53.118
Sing... what's that pill of yours?
He fell asleep again.

48:53.125 --> 48:54.410
It's like that.

48:54.708 --> 48:56.573
We've got to risk.

48:58.125 --> 49:00.787
Miss yu-San, please go over there and help.

49:00.792 --> 49:02.498
Or Mr. ding will lose all his money.

49:02.500 --> 49:03.535
How can I help?

49:03.542 --> 49:05.157
Come over here! I...

49:05.958 --> 49:06.868
Hey, wake up...

49:06.875 --> 49:09.582
Come over, please help us.

49:09.583 --> 49:10.322
How can I help?

49:10.333 --> 49:11.789
Lower your head.

49:13.208 --> 49:15.699
Sing, I'm yu-San, how are you?

49:18.458 --> 49:21.370
Miss yu-San, are you kissing me?

49:22.083 --> 49:24.950
Can you rinse your mouth first next time?

49:27.833 --> 49:31.121
Mr. ding, I can win easily in your casino.

49:31.125 --> 49:34.993
You may have to close your business
after this game.

49:35.708 --> 49:39.451
You're opening and closing your business
on the same day.

49:40.042 --> 49:41.828
I won't be afraid of your winning.

49:42.333 --> 49:43.869
I'm afraid you won't bet all.

49:43.958 --> 49:47.075
I'm betting all on this game.

49:48.708 --> 49:49.538
Shake!

49:49.542 --> 49:53.080
Hold it! Tai-kun, how come you're alive?

49:53.083 --> 49:54.323
That's great!

49:54.333 --> 49:55.448
How come you're not dead?

49:55.667 --> 49:56.281
Stay aside.

49:56.292 --> 49:57.202
How come you're still alive?

49:57.208 --> 49:58.414
We're friends.

49:58.500 --> 49:59.660
Fine.

50:00.375 --> 50:01.495
How come you're still alive?

50:01.542 --> 50:03.453
You're alive too. Why can't I?

50:03.458 --> 50:05.414
Let's stop fighting.

50:05.750 --> 50:07.581
I didn't expect to see you here.

50:07.583 --> 50:08.789
We should be on the same boat.

50:08.792 --> 50:10.874
Try and return to 1991.

50:10.875 --> 50:12.866
I'm not going with you.

50:12.917 --> 50:14.999
I'm important in here.

50:15.000 --> 50:17.412
I'm rich in here.

50:17.500 --> 50:18.831
If I go back to 1991.

50:18.833 --> 50:22.655
I only get around 100 renminbi each month.

50:22.792 --> 50:25.078
You don't want it here. I want.

50:25.250 --> 50:26.365
Please help me.

50:26.375 --> 50:27.831
Let's use our power together.

50:28.583 --> 50:31.165
I'm coming here to win
all money of ding lik...

50:31.167 --> 50:33.374
And not kidding with you.

50:35.208 --> 50:38.245
Fine, then you can't win ding lik.

50:42.958 --> 50:44.949
Sing, are you sure?

51:19.792 --> 51:20.792
Bet!

51:24.875 --> 51:27.833
Damn it, I can't see the one below.

51:28.292 --> 51:29.657
Isit1 or 67

51:31.042 --> 51:34.409
1 is small, 6 is large. Small or large?

51:35.375 --> 51:39.163
It's small, believe me.

51:39.458 --> 51:41.289
Large or small?

51:41.292 --> 51:42.498
Don't bet on this game.

51:42.792 --> 51:46.034
Why not? You want me to lose face?

51:46.583 --> 51:48.289
Large or small?

51:48.333 --> 51:50.073
I can't see through it this time.

51:52.083 --> 51:53.414
Stop bullshitting.

51:53.792 --> 51:55.874
I've never and won't lose face.

51:56.208 --> 51:58.369
Perhaps it's large.

51:59.167 --> 52:01.203
Bet on large.

52:04.625 --> 52:06.365
8 points, small!

52:08.333 --> 52:09.914
Wonderful!

52:10.417 --> 52:13.909
I told you. And you betted it wrong.

52:14.083 --> 52:15.789
I shouldn't have asked you.

52:16.958 --> 52:19.415
Your men have got special power.

52:19.417 --> 52:21.658
I'm so impressed.

52:21.667 --> 52:23.658
But you should give me
a chance to win back.

52:23.667 --> 52:26.409
We'll play cards in your casino
in 10 days time.

52:26.417 --> 52:29.375
Mr. ding, I fully support you.

52:30.333 --> 52:32.870
I'll wait and see.

52:32.958 --> 52:34.994
If I lose again.

52:35.000 --> 52:37.491
Wong kam-kwai and I will leave Shanghai.

52:37.500 --> 52:39.456
And vice-versa for Mr. ding.

52:39.458 --> 52:41.369
The mayor is out witness.

52:42.167 --> 52:43.873
Mr. ding, don't buy that.

52:45.083 --> 52:48.746
If she wins, I can never stay here.

52:48.833 --> 52:50.744
Fine, deal!

52:50.833 --> 52:51.948
Let's go!

52:53.875 --> 52:57.163
Hold it! Where's my uncle?

52:57.917 --> 52:59.498
You'll know.

53:00.958 --> 53:02.448
Hey, tai-kun!

53:03.167 --> 53:05.283
Let's give our applause to sing.

53:05.292 --> 53:09.365
Wonderful... good...

53:09.958 --> 53:11.368
Thanks...

53:11.667 --> 53:13.749
Good... good...

53:27.000 --> 53:30.117
Our nightclub wishes Mr.
Ding lik every success in his casino.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.491
And wishes he beats all Japanese,

53:32.500 --> 53:34.491
and finds his true love.

53:35.083 --> 53:37.699
Sing's really great.

53:39.625 --> 53:40.956
Want to have a toast?

54:02.833 --> 54:04.039
Cheers!

54:11.833 --> 54:14.996
Sing's got special power. Great.

54:15.167 --> 54:17.408
It's he who's got it, not you.

54:17.750 --> 54:19.490
I've got it too...

54:19.500 --> 54:21.081
You're kidding!

54:21.542 --> 54:25.330
No! I'll show you...

54:26.833 --> 54:28.789
Is your ear real?

54:28.833 --> 54:29.948
Comel...

54:29.958 --> 54:31.619
Sing, I'm sorry!

54:31.625 --> 54:32.625
What?

54:32.750 --> 54:33.750
Come!

54:34.167 --> 54:34.906
What is it?

54:34.917 --> 54:36.578
You can only work
when something's "in-between"?

54:36.583 --> 54:37.948
Yes, what is it?

54:37.958 --> 54:39.914
Give me a punch.

54:39.917 --> 54:40.872
Come on!

54:40.875 --> 54:41.955
You're a nuisance!

54:47.125 --> 54:50.117
Yu-San's kiss made you forget "in-between".

54:50.458 --> 54:51.743
I'll go over and see.

54:52.917 --> 54:54.407
- Are you alright?
- No.

54:54.417 --> 54:55.657
- How is it?
- It hurts...

54:55.667 --> 54:56.656
You're really not alright?

54:56.667 --> 54:58.498
Yes...

55:00.333 --> 55:01.743
You're naughty.

55:02.167 --> 55:04.533
Spring, spring...

55:05.792 --> 55:07.623
Making money is important for a man.

55:08.042 --> 55:10.658
I'll give you money.
What business will you start?

55:11.583 --> 55:13.539
A chow tai fook jewellery co.

55:13.542 --> 55:16.614
I only know the business of selling buns.

55:16.917 --> 55:18.282
You can't make a lot by selling buns.

55:18.292 --> 55:19.281
You're right.

55:19.292 --> 55:22.705
But I know one who becomes rich
by selling buns.

55:22.708 --> 55:24.539
- Who?
- McDonalds.

55:25.375 --> 55:26.581
What a strange name.

55:27.417 --> 55:28.748
It's a household word.

55:28.750 --> 55:30.581
We've got a director called mak dong-Hong.

55:30.583 --> 55:31.618
And a singer called Madonna.

55:31.625 --> 55:34.082
They're so rich.

55:34.208 --> 55:35.664
I'll call myself mcdonfook.

55:35.833 --> 55:38.199
I'll be richer than ever.

55:38.208 --> 55:40.351
- I'll set up a mcdonfook bakery.
- Thank you, Mr. ding!

55:40.375 --> 55:41.160
Try your best.

55:41.167 --> 55:42.167
I will.

55:42.500 --> 55:45.742
I'm so happy today.
Sing helped me beat the Japanese.

55:46.792 --> 55:51.206
I've got a girl friend yu-San,
and a lot of good friends.

55:52.125 --> 55:54.036
I've got something to announce.

55:54.042 --> 55:55.452
What?

55:55.542 --> 55:58.614
Miss yu-San and I will
be engaged next month.

55:58.625 --> 56:00.536
Good...

56:03.417 --> 56:08.787
Sing... are you alright?

56:08.792 --> 56:11.374
Don't scare me.

56:16.250 --> 56:19.822
He's seen several doctors.
Still no progress.

56:20.250 --> 56:22.457
Why?

56:24.542 --> 56:26.578
I know a very good German doctor.

56:27.583 --> 56:28.993
I'll ask him to come over.

56:29.000 --> 56:31.867
A doctor can't heal love-sick.

56:31.875 --> 56:32.955
What did you say?

56:33.750 --> 56:37.447
I think we need ginseng to cure him.

56:37.792 --> 56:39.908
I've got a lot.

56:40.000 --> 56:42.491
He can have it every meal.

56:43.917 --> 56:46.829
I can do anything to have him recover.

56:47.542 --> 56:50.284
The future of Shanghai depends on him.

56:51.458 --> 56:52.743
Look after him carefully.

56:55.708 --> 56:57.244
Miss spring! Miss spring!

56:57.250 --> 56:58.410
What is it?

56:58.708 --> 57:02.451
Sing has got love-sick.

57:02.875 --> 57:04.285
Who does he love?

57:04.375 --> 57:06.616
Don't tell the others.

57:06.625 --> 57:07.990
Sure.

57:09.125 --> 57:11.582
He loves miss yu-San.

57:11.750 --> 57:13.365
He wants

57:13.375 --> 57:15.206
- the girl friend of ding lik?
- No, no.

57:15.625 --> 57:17.536
The first time he saw
miss yu-San by the river.

57:17.542 --> 57:20.705
She's all in white, riding a horse.

57:20.708 --> 57:22.198
She smiled at him.

57:22.208 --> 57:24.870
But she didn't want to talk to him
the second time.

57:24.875 --> 57:26.786
So he's at a loss.

57:27.042 --> 57:28.623
Is it... â€œWhat?

57:29.500 --> 57:30.330
Nothing!

57:30.333 --> 57:34.281
If we can ask miss yu-San
to keep him companyfor a day.

57:34.292 --> 57:35.407
Do you think he can get better?

57:35.417 --> 57:36.953
Yes.

57:37.333 --> 57:38.869
Do you think he can regain his power?

57:38.875 --> 57:40.331
Sure!

57:40.625 --> 57:42.661
Fine. Tomorrow I...

57:44.125 --> 57:46.207
No, I'll ask now.

57:48.375 --> 57:49.455
Wet-nurse!

57:50.042 --> 57:51.452
Miss yu-San is not in.

57:51.458 --> 57:53.164
I'm coming for yu-mong.

57:53.208 --> 57:55.540
She's in the room playing.

57:55.542 --> 57:57.908
A German doctor has examined her brains.

57:57.917 --> 57:58.872
What did he say?

57:58.875 --> 58:02.038
He said she suffered from meningitis
when she was small.

58:02.042 --> 58:03.498
That obstructed her growth.

58:03.500 --> 58:07.197
She's only got a 5 year old mentality.

58:07.208 --> 58:08.573
She's incurable.

58:08.583 --> 58:09.493
Let me see her.

58:09.500 --> 58:10.500
O.k.

58:16.667 --> 58:17.827
Yu-mong!

58:19.458 --> 58:20.789
Spring!

58:21.458 --> 58:23.039
You know her?

58:25.417 --> 58:28.033
Let me bring you to her.

58:28.833 --> 58:29.993
Thanks.

58:37.750 --> 58:39.456
Come out, everybody.

58:39.458 --> 58:40.117
What?

58:40.125 --> 58:41.125
Look!

58:45.375 --> 58:47.411
Sweet bean bun, anybody?

58:47.500 --> 58:49.161
Here.

58:49.792 --> 58:51.032
This one for you.

59:00.958 --> 59:03.415
Sing, grandpa's store opens today.

59:03.417 --> 59:05.203
Why do you look so stupid?

59:06.792 --> 59:09.249
She's married somebody else.

59:09.958 --> 59:12.870
Find another one.

59:12.875 --> 59:13.864
It's over! It's over!

59:13.875 --> 59:15.081
Can you say something else?

59:15.083 --> 59:16.493
It's over!

59:17.125 --> 59:18.240
Fook!

59:18.583 --> 59:19.823
Spring!

59:20.000 --> 59:21.536
Look who's here.

59:25.333 --> 59:26.698
Look who's here.

59:36.083 --> 59:37.243
- Fook!
- Spring!

59:37.292 --> 59:38.907
I've brought her here.

59:38.917 --> 59:40.498
You're really engaged?

59:42.042 --> 59:43.452
No.

59:43.458 --> 59:45.949
Mr. ding's just kidding.

59:46.583 --> 59:47.413
Really?

59:47.417 --> 59:49.282
Positive.

59:55.667 --> 59:58.454
Did you hear that? She isn't engaged.

01:00:03.917 --> 01:00:06.829
Go dance and celebrate.

01:00:14.833 --> 01:00:19.156
"Pork buns. Who loves pork buns most?"

01:00:19.167 --> 01:00:21.999
"Who loves freshly baked pork buns?"

01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.787
"And lotus buns, lard buns, shark fin buns"

01:00:24.792 --> 01:00:27.704
"smashed bean buns. Guangdong buns"

01:00:27.708 --> 01:00:30.495
"if you don't love guangdong buns"

01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:33.332
"try the Shanghai buns"

01:00:33.333 --> 01:00:36.200
"there're also steamed bread, pork buns"

01:00:36.208 --> 01:00:37.698
"little steamed bread vegetable buns"

01:00:37.708 --> 01:00:42.532
"my friend, which one would you taste?"

01:00:42.542 --> 01:00:46.239
"No matter which one you will taste?"

01:00:46.250 --> 01:00:50.744
"Guangdong buns, Shanghai buns..."

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:53.913
"Some like guangdong buns"

01:00:54.125 --> 01:00:56.992
she's only yu-San's sister.

01:00:57.000 --> 01:00:59.036
She's only got a 5 year old mentality.

01:00:59.042 --> 01:01:01.158
She's only a kid!

01:01:29.625 --> 01:01:37.625
"My friend, which one would you taste?"

01:01:55.625 --> 01:02:00.540
Let's dance.

01:02:15.375 --> 01:02:19.948
Want to kill me?
Stand it for a while.

01:02:20.833 --> 01:02:23.870
It's tasteless.

01:02:24.208 --> 01:02:25.448
I think this one's better.

01:02:25.458 --> 01:02:26.493
Spring!

01:02:26.583 --> 01:02:27.663
What?

01:02:29.792 --> 01:02:31.657
Look how happy sing and yu-San are.

01:02:31.667 --> 01:02:33.157
I've told you, she's yu-mong.

01:02:33.167 --> 01:02:35.123
She's only a 5 year old kid.

01:02:35.125 --> 01:02:36.615
But they're happy.

01:02:37.792 --> 01:02:40.864
"Mong" means dream. It's a romantic name.

01:02:41.125 --> 01:02:42.160
What "-tic"?

01:02:42.333 --> 01:02:44.039
Romantic.

01:02:46.833 --> 01:02:49.245
I have a name in mind which suits you.

01:02:49.250 --> 01:02:50.035
What?

01:02:50.042 --> 01:02:50.827
"Withered - dream"!

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:52.289
Damn you.

01:02:53.167 --> 01:02:54.532
Just kidding.

01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.991
Look, how beautiful.

01:03:06.208 --> 01:03:07.948
Don't go away.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.494
- Spring!
- I'll kill you.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:10.740
Spring! Spring!

01:03:11.417 --> 01:03:12.532
Yu-San seems so strange.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:14.914
How strange?

01:03:14.917 --> 01:03:17.249
She doesn't talk, just smile.

01:03:19.125 --> 01:03:21.992
She speaks French.

01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.707
Really? Teach me French.

01:03:24.708 --> 01:03:27.780
But you should have a French name first.

01:03:27.792 --> 01:03:28.952
Give me one.

01:03:29.375 --> 01:03:31.832
You're called
"comment allez-vous". O.K. O.K.!

01:03:31.833 --> 01:03:32.822
Is there another which sounds better?

01:03:32.833 --> 01:03:35.950
This one is fine. Don't go away.

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:42.991
Comment allez-vous. Comment allez-vous.

01:03:44.958 --> 01:03:46.164
Kar-lun.

01:04:13.167 --> 01:04:18.116
Give me a kiss, will you?

01:04:18.125 --> 01:04:22.289
If only you kiss me, everything...

01:04:24.792 --> 01:04:25.872
Return so early.

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:26.875
Yes.

01:04:27.500 --> 01:04:29.866
Sing, come here and have some tea.

01:04:29.875 --> 01:04:30.990
O.k.

01:04:33.625 --> 01:04:34.660
Mr. ding!

01:04:35.333 --> 01:04:37.699
Sing, what happens to your mouth?

01:04:39.792 --> 01:04:41.748
A cat bit me.

01:04:42.458 --> 01:04:43.664
Where've you been today?

01:04:44.167 --> 01:04:47.785
Outing. I'm so happy.

01:04:48.333 --> 01:04:49.493
You've got to be careful.

01:04:49.708 --> 01:04:52.370
The Japanese woman and
wong kam-kwai are cruel.

01:04:52.375 --> 01:04:53.535
They can do everything.

01:04:54.042 --> 01:04:56.579
I count on you for the
gamble 10 days later.

01:04:57.375 --> 01:04:59.115
Don't worry, Mr. ding.

01:04:59.708 --> 01:05:02.415
Yu-San, something for you.

01:05:03.042 --> 01:05:04.532
New from France.

01:05:17.375 --> 01:05:18.740
Change your plaster.

01:05:18.750 --> 01:05:19.785
- Sure, sure.
- Come... come...

01:05:19.792 --> 01:05:21.202
Mr. ding, excuse me.

01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:28.163
Sing is very talented,
an excellent gambler.

01:05:28.542 --> 01:05:30.578
But he appears crazy most of the time.

01:05:30.792 --> 01:05:33.124
I must find him a girl friend.

01:05:33.667 --> 01:05:35.623
Which type of girls does he like?

01:05:35.792 --> 01:05:37.407
How do I know?

01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:45.991
Don't. Not here.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:47.581
She's coming...

01:05:48.708 --> 01:05:49.993
Miss yu-San!

01:05:52.125 --> 01:05:53.740
I understand. Because Mr. ding's here.

01:05:53.750 --> 01:05:56.366
You dare not talk to me.

01:05:56.375 --> 01:05:58.912
Do you have time tomorrow?
Let's go out again.

01:05:58.917 --> 01:06:00.373
What are you saying? I don't get in.

01:06:00.375 --> 01:06:02.081
Nobody's around. Don't treat me like that.

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:03.698
We're so happy together today.

01:06:05.333 --> 01:06:06.823
Please don't go too far.

01:06:09.083 --> 01:06:12.075
It serves you right.

01:06:12.083 --> 01:06:13.243
They're 2 different persons.

01:06:13.250 --> 01:06:14.410
Right...

01:06:14.417 --> 01:06:16.783
No, your grandpa said...

01:06:16.792 --> 01:06:17.907
Of course you say that.

01:06:17.917 --> 01:06:19.657
You've neglected me since you found spring.

01:06:19.667 --> 01:06:21.749
You're wrong.

01:06:21.750 --> 01:06:23.581
I don't know what spring's thinking.

01:06:23.583 --> 01:06:25.448
Let me tell you, spring's my grandma.

01:06:25.458 --> 01:06:26.288
So she's your...

01:06:26.292 --> 01:06:27.281
Mom.

01:06:27.292 --> 01:06:28.748
Your wife.

01:06:29.458 --> 01:06:30.743
Your wedding picture...

01:06:30.750 --> 01:06:32.911
Is still hung in my home in 1991.

01:06:32.917 --> 01:06:34.032
Really?

01:06:34.167 --> 01:06:36.499
Believe it or not.

01:06:38.417 --> 01:06:39.122
What is it?

01:06:39.125 --> 01:06:40.205
I want to throw up.

01:06:40.208 --> 01:06:41.243
You should.

01:06:42.333 --> 01:06:43.994
What's this noise?

01:06:45.333 --> 01:06:46.948
- The phone's ringing.
- Indeed.

01:06:46.958 --> 01:06:49.449
Mr. ding... Mr. ding...

01:06:49.458 --> 01:06:50.948
Mr. ding...

01:06:50.958 --> 01:06:53.244
Mr. ding's notaround. You answer it.

01:06:54.542 --> 01:06:55.201
Hello!

01:06:55.208 --> 01:06:57.119
Sing, I'm brother five.

01:06:57.458 --> 01:06:59.995
You finally called me.

01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.706
I couldn't get through these 2 days.

01:07:01.708 --> 01:07:03.494
Me too.

01:07:03.875 --> 01:07:05.331
Listen carefully.

01:07:06.333 --> 01:07:08.244
I'm in Shanghai. It's 1937 now.

01:07:08.250 --> 01:07:09.250
When?

01:07:09.750 --> 01:07:11.615
It's ridiculous. But
you've got to believe me.

01:07:11.625 --> 01:07:14.332
I'm in Shanghai in 1937.

01:07:14.333 --> 01:07:15.197
How come?

01:07:15.208 --> 01:07:17.244
Because I challenged tai-kun with my power.

01:07:17.750 --> 01:07:18.660
As far as I know.

01:07:18.667 --> 01:07:21.204
The power at its height
will change the time.

01:07:21.208 --> 01:07:23.290
And I was sent many years back.

01:07:23.667 --> 01:07:24.702
What should I do?

01:07:24.708 --> 01:07:27.370
Try and find some men with special power.

01:07:27.375 --> 01:07:28.205
Use the same method.

01:07:28.208 --> 01:07:29.823
See if they can bring me back.

01:07:30.125 --> 01:07:31.285
I see.

01:07:33.417 --> 01:07:36.124
Our latest anti-terrorists equipment.

01:07:36.375 --> 01:07:38.286
5 feet 7 human body.

01:07:38.542 --> 01:07:42.706
Automatic pistol, grenade, gas mask.

01:07:42.708 --> 01:07:43.743
- Hey!
- One more.

01:07:43.750 --> 01:07:44.409
Hold it!

01:07:44.458 --> 01:07:46.323
They can't escape.

01:07:46.333 --> 01:07:48.665
Pistol with infrared detector. Take it.

01:07:48.667 --> 01:07:49.497
Wait!

01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:50.865
Sing, I'll rescue you.

01:07:50.875 --> 01:07:52.456
Don't talk too much with him.

01:07:52.458 --> 01:07:53.948
I'm commissioner wong. Who are you?

01:07:53.958 --> 01:07:57.951
I'm the Shanghai "Saint
of gamblers" in 1937.

01:07:57.958 --> 01:07:59.539
I'm "scissors' legs".

01:07:59.542 --> 01:08:01.248
Bet it 1937 or 1997.

01:08:01.250 --> 01:08:03.616
I'm hurrying to a meeting.

01:08:03.833 --> 01:08:04.948
I want to talk to brother five.

01:08:04.958 --> 01:08:06.744
Or I'll smash your head with a punch.

01:08:06.750 --> 01:08:07.865
You'll smash my head?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:09.490
My legs will break your neck.

01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:11.286
Keep it short with him.

01:08:11.458 --> 01:08:13.619
Don't hang up yet. Hello...

01:08:13.625 --> 01:08:15.661
He's really in Shanghai in 1937.

01:08:15.750 --> 01:08:19.493
You can call him from here?

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:22.366
Don't take me for an idiot.

01:08:47.167 --> 01:08:51.911
He's not sing? How come
yu-mong has seen him?

01:09:03.125 --> 01:09:06.572
And ding lik will surely die.

01:09:07.207 --> 01:09:12.532
Of course. If my daughter marries ding lik.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:14.786
He won't be on the defensive.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:19.622
We can kill him before the wedding banquet.

01:09:20.832 --> 01:09:22.915
We the Japanese are indeed proud of you.

01:09:22.917 --> 01:09:26.488
We let you be the mayor,
and you're indeed helpful.

01:09:27.417 --> 01:09:30.705
Thank you.

01:09:31.375 --> 01:09:34.242
We have to kill ding lik first.

01:09:34.250 --> 01:09:36.912
That chow sing Cho is not an obstacle.

01:09:50.292 --> 01:09:51.292
Hey!

01:09:53.250 --> 01:09:54.865
You've heard all we've said.

01:09:56.667 --> 01:09:59.374
I don't want to talk to a traitor.

01:09:59.375 --> 01:10:01.912
I'm a traitor. What about your dad?

01:10:02.833 --> 01:10:04.198
He's not a traitor.

01:10:04.208 --> 01:10:06.620
Right, he's not a traitor.

01:10:06.750 --> 01:10:08.240
He's a dog of the traitors.

01:10:12.333 --> 01:10:13.413
You hit me?

01:10:23.167 --> 01:10:24.373
Yu-San!

01:10:25.292 --> 01:10:26.657
Why did you push my daughter down there?

01:10:26.667 --> 01:10:28.123
- She's heard all.
- Stop it!

01:10:28.125 --> 01:10:29.925
This is no time for
asking who's responsible.

01:10:31.208 --> 01:10:33.494
Your daughter's dead. Who
will ding lik marry?

01:10:33.708 --> 01:10:34.708
Her!

01:10:37.250 --> 01:10:38.114
Her?

01:10:38.167 --> 01:10:41.204
She's my daughter, a
little mentally retarded.

01:10:43.875 --> 01:10:47.663
Doesn't matter. She looks like yu-San.

01:10:53.417 --> 01:10:54.998
Be good, drink.

01:10:55.292 --> 01:10:59.490
You're not yu-mong now. You're yu-San.

01:10:59.917 --> 01:11:01.782
Ding lik's your flance.

01:11:02.708 --> 01:11:06.121
I'll kill you if you don't follow my words.

01:11:06.667 --> 01:11:07.667
Drink.

01:11:07.708 --> 01:11:08.993
Mayor!

01:11:10.083 --> 01:11:11.083
Lik!

01:11:11.292 --> 01:11:12.657
How's miss yu-San?

01:11:12.792 --> 01:11:15.158
Not serious. Just got a flu.

01:11:18.417 --> 01:11:20.749
Yu-San, how are you?

01:11:23.917 --> 01:11:26.408
Yu-San, are you alright?

01:11:29.750 --> 01:11:30.580
Miss yu-San!

01:11:30.583 --> 01:11:31.663
Yu-San!

01:11:32.833 --> 01:11:34.744
Though sing is our very good friend.

01:11:34.750 --> 01:11:36.286
You can't do that.

01:11:36.583 --> 01:11:38.583
She acted strangely
because she's not feeling well.

01:11:38.792 --> 01:11:39.827
Don't.

01:11:40.167 --> 01:11:42.374
Mr. ding!

01:11:42.375 --> 01:11:42.955
Lik!

01:11:42.958 --> 01:11:43.492
Mr. ding!

01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:44.535
Lik!

01:11:45.958 --> 01:11:46.993
Though I'm very handsome.

01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:49.412
You shouldn't do that in front of Mr. ding.

01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:50.535
You got that?

01:11:54.333 --> 01:11:56.369
I hope you won't go that far.

01:11:58.583 --> 01:12:00.119
Please, don't.

01:12:00.125 --> 01:12:02.161
You've got a strange temper. I'm at a loss.

01:12:02.167 --> 01:12:04.249
What do you want? Tell me!

01:12:06.333 --> 01:12:07.698
- Where's Mr. ding?
- Gone.

01:12:07.708 --> 01:12:09.824
He asked you to meet him at the club.

01:12:09.833 --> 01:12:11.915
Something important to discuss with you.

01:12:23.375 --> 01:12:27.038
Sing, why did Mr. ding ask for you?

01:12:27.042 --> 01:12:28.922
It's been several hours,
he's still not arrived.

01:12:29.458 --> 01:12:31.494
Why?

01:12:33.833 --> 01:12:37.781
Is he mad with you since
his girl loves you?

01:12:38.167 --> 01:12:40.658
Don't be silly.

01:12:40.833 --> 01:12:42.949
Let's play safe. Let's go.

01:12:43.375 --> 01:12:44.581
This isn't a good idea.

01:12:44.583 --> 01:12:45.163
What?

01:12:45.167 --> 01:12:47.499
When hui man-keung stepped out of here
the other night.

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.956
He got shot.

01:12:48.958 --> 01:12:51.700
If we stepped out, maybe...

01:12:52.583 --> 01:12:55.290
Let's wait here a bit longer.

01:12:58.875 --> 01:13:00.456
Until when?

01:13:06.958 --> 01:13:07.993
Anybody?

01:13:08.708 --> 01:13:09.788
No.

01:13:11.333 --> 01:13:12.072
No!

01:13:12.083 --> 01:13:13.198
- No!
- Look carefully.

01:13:13.208 --> 01:13:15.119
No, don't worry.

01:13:15.875 --> 01:13:17.035
Nothing happened.

01:13:17.042 --> 01:13:18.782
We should be careful.

01:13:18.792 --> 01:13:19.792
You're right.

01:13:29.458 --> 01:13:30.573
Wong kam-kwai?

01:13:32.167 --> 01:13:34.453
Don't touch me yet.

01:13:34.458 --> 01:13:35.823
So it's wong kam-kwai.

01:13:36.833 --> 01:13:38.323
How come the mayor's with him?

01:13:38.333 --> 01:13:40.244
The mayor is also a traitor.

01:13:40.250 --> 01:13:44.243
So it's wong instead of ding
who asked you to come.

01:13:44.625 --> 01:13:46.081
So you're the traitor too.

01:13:46.125 --> 01:13:47.615
I would've beaten the hell out of you.

01:13:47.625 --> 01:13:48.625
Yes.

01:13:48.792 --> 01:13:50.953
You won't do it? I will.

01:13:52.792 --> 01:13:53.451
Hey!

01:13:53.458 --> 01:13:54.743
Why...

01:13:54.750 --> 01:13:56.490
You've got no using value.

01:13:57.417 --> 01:13:58.417
Hey!

01:14:05.208 --> 01:14:06.072
Who is it?

01:14:06.083 --> 01:14:10.201
He's a brilliant fighter of Japan.

01:14:16.375 --> 01:14:21.540
Sing, help! Help!

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.282
Rescue him.

01:14:24.250 --> 01:14:26.081
Are you grandpa or uncle?

01:14:27.792 --> 01:14:28.998
He's my uncle.

01:14:29.167 --> 01:14:32.034
He and tai-kun are in my hand.

01:14:34.625 --> 01:14:35.330
Good grandson!

01:14:35.333 --> 01:14:36.539
What do you want?

01:14:36.833 --> 01:14:40.951
You must know.

01:14:45.042 --> 01:14:48.000
Uncle, grandpa, to rescue you.

01:14:48.333 --> 01:14:51.405
I have to give up myself
to this female beast.

01:14:51.542 --> 01:14:53.407
Come over!

01:14:54.667 --> 01:14:56.123
Damn you.

01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:59.697
You thought I liked you?

01:15:00.167 --> 01:15:01.873
I want you to kill ding lik.

01:15:01.958 --> 01:15:04.290
That's impossible.

01:15:04.292 --> 01:15:06.954
He's very kind to me. I can't.

01:15:07.083 --> 01:15:07.993
Can you?

01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:09.956
Wong kam-kwai, the punishment.

01:15:09.958 --> 01:15:11.323
- Pull!
- Don't!

01:15:11.333 --> 01:15:13.039
- Yes.
- Watch out!

01:15:18.292 --> 01:15:21.284
It's been lengthened! Don't...

01:15:21.292 --> 01:15:22.532
You don't know him.

01:15:22.542 --> 01:15:24.248
My uncle's a hero.

01:15:24.250 --> 01:15:27.162
He won't give in.

01:15:27.958 --> 01:15:31.621
Dad, I can't believe he said such things.

01:15:31.625 --> 01:15:35.197
You should try the ounishment.

01:15:35.375 --> 01:15:36.740
Take them out.

01:15:39.083 --> 01:15:39.822
Fook!

01:15:39.833 --> 01:15:41.869
Yu-San! Spring!

01:15:42.167 --> 01:15:43.167
Spring!

01:15:43.542 --> 01:15:45.498
Sing, don't believe them.

01:15:45.500 --> 01:15:48.992
She's yu-mong, mentally retarded.

01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:50.240
What did you say?

01:15:50.625 --> 01:15:52.206
They're twins.

01:15:52.208 --> 01:15:56.281
Ding lik loves the elder sister.
You love the idiot.

01:15:59.792 --> 01:16:02.374
Idiot? Where's yu-San?

01:16:02.375 --> 01:16:04.457
She's killed.

01:16:04.708 --> 01:16:08.906
Right. I killed her.

01:16:12.375 --> 01:16:14.787
Let him off!

01:16:14.833 --> 01:16:16.494
Take the 2 of them to...

01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:19.242
Don't. They can't stand it.

01:16:19.458 --> 01:16:22.996
Let her finish.

01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.457
They really can't stand it.

01:16:28.292 --> 01:16:30.078
I promise you, let them off.

01:16:30.625 --> 01:16:32.490
Take them inside, let chow tai fook off.

01:16:32.500 --> 01:16:33.865
How about me?

01:16:33.875 --> 01:16:34.785
Stay and continue.

01:16:34.792 --> 01:16:36.453
Don't!

01:16:43.458 --> 01:16:46.291
I've loosen you. Go away.

01:16:46.792 --> 01:16:48.748
Use your hands, please.

01:16:49.208 --> 01:16:50.664
Stupid.

01:16:51.458 --> 01:16:52.413
Haven't they cracked?

01:16:52.417 --> 01:16:53.417
What do you say?

01:16:53.792 --> 01:16:54.747
- Come on!
- Yes.

01:16:54.750 --> 01:16:55.750
Loosen him!

01:16:59.708 --> 01:17:02.040
What do you want from us?

01:17:02.125 --> 01:17:04.332
Kill ding lik.

01:17:04.333 --> 01:17:05.664
Kill him?

01:17:05.667 --> 01:17:07.407
It's no use to force me.

01:17:07.417 --> 01:17:08.702
I just can't kill him.

01:17:08.708 --> 01:17:09.493
Right.

01:17:09.500 --> 01:17:11.161
Hypnotize yourself.

01:17:11.167 --> 01:17:14.124
You can kill him when you hate him.

01:17:14.125 --> 01:17:16.662
- Hypnotize?
- Tell me how.

01:17:17.750 --> 01:17:20.913
I must kill this fucking ding lik!

01:17:21.208 --> 01:17:23.995
Kill this fucking ding lik.

01:17:30.792 --> 01:17:32.828
She shouted like that in front of me.

01:17:33.542 --> 01:17:37.080
She sounded hysterical and looked horrible.

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:39.365
And I found she was a fool.

01:17:39.375 --> 01:17:41.115
And I walked out of there.

01:17:41.833 --> 01:17:45.405
You just walked out?

01:17:46.375 --> 01:17:48.331
Because I have special power.

01:17:48.833 --> 01:17:50.323
You can't see me, you can't see me.

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:51.664
And I was out of there.

01:18:00.667 --> 01:18:02.328
Mr. ding, sit here.

01:18:08.750 --> 01:18:11.287
The Japanese must have a set-up.

01:18:11.292 --> 01:18:13.624
We can't lose in the gamble
the day after tomorrow.

01:18:28.333 --> 01:18:31.200
Sing, it's too noisy.

01:18:31.208 --> 01:18:34.575
What did you say? Again!

01:18:35.167 --> 01:18:36.828
I can't hear you!

01:18:36.833 --> 01:18:38.323
What?

01:18:38.500 --> 01:18:39.660
Oh, sorry!

01:18:41.500 --> 01:18:42.910
Mr. ding, don't worry.

01:18:42.917 --> 01:18:45.749
I know the Japanese
will surrender 8 years later.

01:18:45.750 --> 01:18:48.537
Because the Americans bombed...

01:19:02.375 --> 01:19:04.115
It's hard.

01:19:04.625 --> 01:19:05.740
Want to try some?

01:19:06.250 --> 01:19:09.083
Sing, what do you want to say?

01:19:09.500 --> 01:19:12.788
The milk is in your study room.

01:19:41.750 --> 01:19:44.662
Let's play some chess.

01:19:44.667 --> 01:19:47.659
Sing, answer me.

01:19:47.917 --> 01:19:48.917
What?

01:19:49.083 --> 01:19:51.039
Do you love miss yu-San very much?

01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.785
Why?

01:19:54.292 --> 01:19:58.205
I treasure friends more than women.

01:19:59.875 --> 01:20:02.161
And the country's now depends on you.

01:20:03.375 --> 01:20:08.324
I'll let you have yu-San if you love her.

01:20:09.333 --> 01:20:11.745
So that you can concentrate
to fight the Japanese.

01:20:13.750 --> 01:20:15.911
Sing, are you alright?

01:20:16.250 --> 01:20:19.572
Yes, you're so very kind to me.

01:20:19.917 --> 01:20:21.953
I'm so sorry.

01:20:27.083 --> 01:20:28.163
Mr. ding!

01:20:29.500 --> 01:20:31.661
I'm a bit thirsty.

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:38.823
You seem to be very thirsty.

01:20:38.833 --> 01:20:40.869
You can drink in whatever
manner you want here.

01:20:41.917 --> 01:20:43.453
But behave yourself outside.

01:20:44.542 --> 01:20:48.865
The Japanese have a kind of drug

01:20:48.875 --> 01:20:51.116
to poison important Chinese persons.

01:20:52.083 --> 01:20:55.621
Many great fighters died because of this.

01:20:57.375 --> 01:20:59.787
This drug has several features.

01:21:00.792 --> 01:21:04.330
First, you'll feel extremely excited.

01:21:05.167 --> 01:21:08.125
Second, mist will come out of you.

01:21:09.542 --> 01:21:14.332
Third, you can't control your limbs.

01:21:15.500 --> 01:21:19.618
Then you'll deel cold,
get a cramp, and die.

01:21:31.208 --> 01:21:32.823
Sing, are you alright?

01:21:32.833 --> 01:21:35.745
I'm... fine.

01:21:38.083 --> 01:21:39.038
Fine?

01:21:39.042 --> 01:21:40.407
- I'm fine.
- You look pale.

01:21:40.417 --> 01:21:41.998
I'll be fine.

01:21:44.042 --> 01:21:45.077
Are you sure?

01:21:45.083 --> 01:21:46.038
Much better.

01:21:46.042 --> 01:21:47.498
You do look pale.

01:21:47.625 --> 01:21:49.115
I'll call a doctor.

01:22:07.250 --> 01:22:08.330
Sing!

01:22:10.833 --> 01:22:14.872
I'm cool in this leather tie.

01:22:17.333 --> 01:22:19.995
Come on in!

01:22:20.792 --> 01:22:22.999
Why don't you kill him?

01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:26.037
Sing, are you helping the Japanese?

01:22:26.167 --> 01:22:27.407
I can't help it.

01:22:27.417 --> 01:22:29.032
That woman caught my uncle and yu-mong.

01:22:29.042 --> 01:22:30.452
Threaten to kill them.

01:22:31.250 --> 01:22:32.410
Yu-mong?

01:22:32.917 --> 01:22:35.374
She's the twin sister of yu-San.

01:22:35.375 --> 01:22:37.366
I've been taking her for yu-San.

01:22:37.708 --> 01:22:39.869
The mayor is a traitor.

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.116
Yu-San was killed by wong kam-kwai.

01:22:43.125 --> 01:22:46.913
The one we visited was yu-mong, not yu-San.

01:22:49.250 --> 01:22:50.615
Then you come back to kill me.

01:22:51.708 --> 01:22:54.199
You know I just can't kill you.

01:22:54.250 --> 01:22:58.323
You've been so nice. I don't want to do it.

01:23:01.625 --> 01:23:03.741
Sing, take this.

01:23:06.250 --> 01:23:07.706
You're a smart guy.

01:23:08.625 --> 01:23:11.162
If killing me can save them.

01:23:11.917 --> 01:23:13.123
Take it.

01:23:13.792 --> 01:23:15.657
I hope after you rescue them,

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:20.326
kill the woman and wong
for me, and for yu-San.

01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:26.036
Take it, take it.

01:23:31.667 --> 01:23:32.782
Top killer!

01:23:32.792 --> 01:23:33.656
Sing!

01:23:33.667 --> 01:23:34.952
Quick!

01:23:36.708 --> 01:23:40.451
I'm sorry, Mr. ding, he's my son.

01:23:40.750 --> 01:23:41.830
Hold it!

01:23:41.833 --> 01:23:43.539
There must be some other way.

01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.207
If only we can take something from Mr.
Ding...

01:23:46.208 --> 01:23:47.994
And take it to her.

01:23:48.000 --> 01:23:50.116
And then announced the death of Mr. ding.

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.615
Maybe this is the way out.

01:23:52.542 --> 01:23:54.032
So what will you take from me?

01:24:05.750 --> 01:24:08.241
These teeth are the only thing left.

01:24:08.833 --> 01:24:09.697
Only these teeth are left?

01:24:09.708 --> 01:24:10.948
Yes! Yes!

01:24:10.958 --> 01:24:14.655
We've bombed him. It's in the news.

01:24:14.875 --> 01:24:17.161
Please let my son off.

01:24:17.167 --> 01:24:19.032
And also yu-mong and spring?

01:24:19.083 --> 01:24:21.916
Don't! Ding lik's still alive.

01:24:22.875 --> 01:24:24.285
Sing...

01:24:26.583 --> 01:24:27.698
Say it again!

01:24:28.042 --> 01:24:29.042
Sing...

01:24:30.125 --> 01:24:31.706
Sing...

01:24:31.708 --> 01:24:32.823
Fook...

01:24:32.958 --> 01:24:34.038
- Spring!
- Fook!

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:36.533
- Spring, how are you?
- Sing...

01:24:36.542 --> 01:24:38.624
She can speak your name.

01:24:39.042 --> 01:24:40.452
- Sing...
- Spring...

01:24:40.458 --> 01:24:44.576
- Fook!
- Sing...

01:24:48.458 --> 01:24:50.540
Why don't you speak to yu-mong?

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.457
How can I? She's mentally retarded.

01:24:53.458 --> 01:24:56.655
She's just a 5 year old kid.

01:24:57.250 --> 01:25:00.947
You should've told me earlier.

01:25:00.958 --> 01:25:02.698
Why are you staring at me?

01:25:03.375 --> 01:25:04.831
She takes me for a brother.

01:25:04.833 --> 01:25:07.495
Or a father.

01:25:08.708 --> 01:25:10.949
And you can take her for
a daughter or sister.

01:25:10.958 --> 01:25:12.414
Be kind to her.

01:25:12.417 --> 01:25:14.453
Datingis not the only thing between you.

01:25:17.333 --> 01:25:18.038
Really?

01:25:18.042 --> 01:25:19.282
Sure.

01:25:19.292 --> 01:25:20.782
Sing...

01:25:21.375 --> 01:25:24.867
Don't cry, stop crying...

01:25:24.875 --> 01:25:27.742
Sing, she's crying.

01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.285
Talk to her.

01:25:32.708 --> 01:25:35.996
Yu-mong! Yu-mong!

01:25:37.750 --> 01:25:39.240
Sing...

01:25:39.250 --> 01:25:40.456
Yu-mong...

01:25:42.750 --> 01:25:43.990
Sing...

01:25:48.542 --> 01:25:49.907
Don't be afraid!

01:25:57.792 --> 01:26:00.955
Dad, dinner's ready.

01:26:02.042 --> 01:26:04.829
How dare you!

01:26:04.833 --> 01:26:06.869
Dad, don't be mad.

01:26:06.875 --> 01:26:08.035
Stop it!

01:26:08.292 --> 01:26:10.374
You traitor!

01:26:10.375 --> 01:26:13.412
Listen. If you stop now and let us off.

01:26:13.417 --> 01:26:14.702
I still take you as my son.

01:26:14.708 --> 01:26:17.450
A lot of Japanese are outside.

01:26:17.458 --> 01:26:19.369
You've got no way out
even if I let you off.

01:26:19.583 --> 01:26:22.120
How come you've got caught by them?

01:26:22.375 --> 01:26:25.333
The other night I tried to find you.

01:26:25.458 --> 01:26:29.030
Suddenly I was here.

01:26:29.042 --> 01:26:31.408
The Japanese woman has
caught me and tai-kun.

01:26:31.417 --> 01:26:32.827
Have they stolen your phone?

01:26:32.833 --> 01:26:33.447
How do you know?

01:26:33.458 --> 01:26:35.119
I saw it and I used it.

01:26:35.125 --> 01:26:36.410
And I could put it through h.K.

01:26:36.417 --> 01:26:36.997
You could?

01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:37.659
Yes.

01:26:37.667 --> 01:26:38.656
Who did you call?

01:26:38.667 --> 01:26:40.077
The weather forecast!

01:26:40.583 --> 01:26:44.030
Damn you. You should've
called brother five.

01:26:44.042 --> 01:26:45.498
Asked him to rescue us.

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:46.114
Listen.

01:26:46.125 --> 01:26:48.457
That damn phone doesn't always work.

01:26:48.458 --> 01:26:49.243
So?

01:26:49.250 --> 01:26:50.615
Call until somebody answers.

01:26:50.708 --> 01:26:53.541
I'll castrate myself if
you don't regret it.

01:26:53.542 --> 01:26:55.999
Don't do that.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.706
I'm trying to call.

01:27:00.667 --> 01:27:04.831
It must put through.

01:27:05.292 --> 01:27:06.873
Mr. long, your call.

01:27:07.250 --> 01:27:08.160
Who is it?

01:27:08.167 --> 01:27:10.374
Brother five, I'm tat.

01:27:10.500 --> 01:27:11.831
Where are you?

01:27:11.833 --> 01:27:13.869
We're back in time.

01:27:13.875 --> 01:27:15.581
We're in Shanghai in 1937.

01:27:15.583 --> 01:27:18.996
We were caught by a Japanese woman.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.913
It's 76, ha fei road.

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:26.072
Tell sing that I've found men
who've got special power

01:27:26.083 --> 01:27:27.072
to come and rescue you.

01:27:27.083 --> 01:27:28.198
Quicker then...

01:27:30.667 --> 01:27:31.782
Hello!

01:27:40.625 --> 01:27:42.161
You said you can take objects
in different space,

01:27:42.167 --> 01:27:43.282
why doesn't it work?

01:27:43.292 --> 01:27:45.123
But I can't take off my pants.

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:46.456
They're tight.

01:27:48.000 --> 01:27:50.082
I know how to hypnotize.

01:27:50.083 --> 01:27:51.493
I can influence the mind of others.

01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:52.956
And make them follow my words.

01:27:52.958 --> 01:27:54.414
But I must pick those who look stupid.

01:27:54.417 --> 01:27:55.202
Why?

01:27:55.208 --> 01:27:58.166
Smart guy've strong will power.
Difficult to manipulate.

01:28:02.208 --> 01:28:04.073
This one is great.

01:28:05.875 --> 01:28:08.537
Take the key and let us out.

01:28:10.333 --> 01:28:14.326
Open the door! Open the door!

01:28:14.708 --> 01:28:16.448
What?

01:28:18.417 --> 01:28:19.577
Open the door right away!

01:28:19.625 --> 01:28:21.206
Quick! Open the door!

01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.161
Quick! I can't stand it.

01:28:29.458 --> 01:28:30.698
Oh god!

01:28:30.708 --> 01:28:34.656
Damn it! Damn it!

01:28:38.958 --> 01:28:41.574
Force is the most practical thing.

01:28:42.417 --> 01:28:43.998
Indeed a top killer.

01:28:44.417 --> 01:28:45.657
You bet!

01:28:45.750 --> 01:28:48.207
You're still an effeminate top killer.

01:28:57.125 --> 01:28:57.739
Top killer.

01:28:57.750 --> 01:28:58.489
Yes.

01:28:58.500 --> 01:28:59.785
You protect them and go first.

01:28:59.792 --> 01:29:00.781
Any further mission?

01:29:00.792 --> 01:29:01.497
Watch your steps.

01:29:01.500 --> 01:29:02.500
O.k.

01:29:02.750 --> 01:29:03.535
Go! Go!

01:29:03.542 --> 01:29:04.748
- Don't look, go!
- Go, quick...

01:29:04.750 --> 01:29:05.956
Sing!

01:30:50.250 --> 01:30:51.740
Punch yourself.

01:30:52.167 --> 01:30:53.953
Another punch.

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:03.163
You can't manipulate me.

01:31:04.417 --> 01:31:05.497
Hey!

01:31:06.375 --> 01:31:07.581
My call...

01:31:08.583 --> 01:31:09.583
Hello!

01:31:11.083 --> 01:31:12.083
Quick!

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.500
Fine!

01:31:17.292 --> 01:31:18.292
Stop it.

01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.707
I want to speak to long five.

01:31:28.875 --> 01:31:31.617
Shit, call me this late.

01:31:31.625 --> 01:31:34.992
Tell him I'll arrest him soon.

01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.366
He stole the police equipment.

01:31:37.375 --> 01:31:40.412
And took all the men
with special power away.

01:31:40.667 --> 01:31:43.079
I'm now being locked.

01:31:43.083 --> 01:31:44.072
I can't stand it anymore.

01:31:44.083 --> 01:31:46.244
No big deal.

01:31:46.250 --> 01:31:50.573
Use your fingers and stab!

01:31:53.083 --> 01:31:55.074
Have you stabbed his eyes?

01:31:55.375 --> 01:31:57.832
No, I've stabbed into his nostrils.

01:31:57.833 --> 01:32:01.121
Scratch until all the air comes out.

01:32:02.458 --> 01:32:04.119
It's off, great!

01:32:04.375 --> 01:32:05.455
You bet.

01:32:05.458 --> 01:32:08.495
I've taught kung-fu through the phone
years ago.

01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:09.500
Where's long five?

01:32:10.667 --> 01:32:13.499
I'm locked by a so-called ghost lock.

01:32:13.500 --> 01:32:16.572
This is difficult.

01:32:18.292 --> 01:32:19.873
Ask all senior cops to come in.

01:32:19.875 --> 01:32:20.910
Yes, sir!

01:32:21.292 --> 01:32:23.749
Any idea?

01:32:24.208 --> 01:32:26.699
This kind of lock is very powerful.

01:32:26.708 --> 01:32:28.198
Let's find a way.

01:32:28.208 --> 01:32:29.118
Stab his eyes!

01:32:29.125 --> 01:32:30.706
- Surrender!
- Damn you!

01:32:31.250 --> 01:32:32.285
You're now in trouble.

01:32:32.292 --> 01:32:33.498
How can you save yourself.

01:32:33.500 --> 01:32:36.082
I can use the kung-fu of stealing.

01:32:36.708 --> 01:32:38.323
Steal! Steal!

01:32:44.958 --> 01:32:45.617
Have you stolen it?

01:32:45.625 --> 01:32:47.365
Yes, it's big.

01:32:47.958 --> 01:32:49.198
Stop talking...

01:32:49.208 --> 01:32:51.790
I'll teach you "scissors' legs".

01:32:51.792 --> 01:32:54.033
You jump, with legs touching the wall.

01:32:54.042 --> 01:32:57.034
Turn 180, legs gripping his neck.

01:32:58.750 --> 01:33:00.035
- Is he who shouts?
- It's me.

01:33:00.042 --> 01:33:02.624
Haven't you used "scissors' legs"?

01:33:03.042 --> 01:33:04.623
I'll save that for future use.

01:33:04.625 --> 01:33:08.573
I was caught by a so-called twist lock.

01:33:08.583 --> 01:33:11.370
That's even more powerful.

01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:14.286
Any solutions?

01:33:14.292 --> 01:33:15.657
Shoot him...

01:33:15.667 --> 01:33:17.123
Shoot him.

01:33:17.792 --> 01:33:18.907
I haven't got a plstol.

01:33:18.917 --> 01:33:21.533
What have you got?

01:33:21.583 --> 01:33:23.198
Just a phone.

01:33:23.208 --> 01:33:24.823
Hit him with it.

01:33:30.500 --> 01:33:34.072
You've broken my phone, give me a new one.

01:33:38.083 --> 01:33:39.448
Sing!

01:33:41.917 --> 01:33:43.157
Sing!

01:33:43.833 --> 01:33:45.073
Why are you coming back?

01:33:50.458 --> 01:33:52.744
Hit me, don't hit her.

01:33:53.542 --> 01:33:57.740
I'm cutting your "scissors' legs".

01:34:02.417 --> 01:34:03.372
Impressed?

01:34:03.375 --> 01:34:04.205
Very impressed.

01:34:04.208 --> 01:34:05.744
Say sorry then.

01:34:05.917 --> 01:34:06.747
Sorry!

01:34:06.750 --> 01:34:09.116
Say to her.

01:34:09.125 --> 01:34:10.990
Sorry, miss!

01:34:12.208 --> 01:34:13.448
Fine.

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:17.741
Hello!

01:34:19.750 --> 01:34:22.662
"Scissors' legs" are indeed great.

01:34:23.500 --> 01:34:24.831
Yu-mong, how are you?

01:34:25.458 --> 01:34:27.665
Fine... since he said sorry.

01:34:27.667 --> 01:34:30.704
Don't be afraid, stop crying.

01:34:36.042 --> 01:34:38.784
There's no reason for her to love me.

01:34:38.792 --> 01:34:39.827
I don't get it.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.536
Don't worry, nobody's around.

01:34:45.542 --> 01:34:47.498
I've said there's no way out.

01:34:47.958 --> 01:34:49.789
- Don't...
- Shake... shake...

01:34:52.458 --> 01:34:54.619
Save that.

01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:56.365
Go!

01:35:09.208 --> 01:35:12.530
Mr. ding, how come sing hasn't returned?

01:35:17.458 --> 01:35:21.246
The "Saint of gamblers"
seems dare not appear.

01:35:21.250 --> 01:35:22.535
Give us another 15 minutes.

01:35:22.542 --> 01:35:26.990
Fine, then you'll lose with, no regrets.

01:35:27.125 --> 01:35:30.037
He'll be treated as a loser
if he doesn't show up.

01:35:30.417 --> 01:35:33.705
Remember if you lose,

01:35:33.708 --> 01:35:35.949
you have to leave Shanghai.

01:35:41.875 --> 01:35:44.082
Sing, can special power resist bullets?

01:35:44.083 --> 01:35:44.742
Sure.

01:35:44.750 --> 01:35:45.330
Fine.

01:35:45.333 --> 01:35:46.118
But you'll die afterwards.

01:35:46.125 --> 01:35:47.125
Fuck you!

01:35:47.250 --> 01:35:48.250
Shoot!

01:35:55.125 --> 01:35:56.160
Get down!

01:36:08.875 --> 01:36:09.875
Go!

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:51.989
Brother five, time's up!

01:36:52.000 --> 01:36:53.000
I know!

01:37:16.333 --> 01:37:17.333
Sing!

01:37:18.208 --> 01:37:20.369
Brother five, you're on time.

01:37:20.375 --> 01:37:21.080
Where's uncle?

01:37:21.083 --> 01:37:22.414
He's in the punishment room.

01:37:22.417 --> 01:37:23.577
- Go quickly!
- Yes, sir!

01:37:23.583 --> 01:37:24.948
The one who's 7 feet tall.

01:37:25.167 --> 01:37:26.282
How do you come here?

01:37:26.500 --> 01:37:28.036
I've found the association
of special power.

01:37:28.042 --> 01:37:30.909
45 members used their special power
and sent me here.

01:37:31.125 --> 01:37:32.240
But after 15 minutes,

01:37:32.250 --> 01:37:34.332
they'll use power again and bring me back.

01:37:34.333 --> 01:37:35.322
Let's go!

01:37:35.333 --> 01:37:36.618
No, not now.

01:37:36.625 --> 01:37:37.159
Why?

01:37:37.167 --> 01:37:38.873
Brother five! Sing!

01:37:39.625 --> 01:37:40.705
You go back with brother five right away.

01:37:40.708 --> 01:37:42.039
Yu-mong and I are going to the casino.

01:37:42.042 --> 01:37:43.122
Look after dad for me.

01:37:43.125 --> 01:37:43.864
Sure.

01:37:43.875 --> 01:37:45.581
Sing, how are you getting back?

01:37:45.875 --> 01:37:48.082
You ask those members to use power
after an hour.

01:37:48.083 --> 01:37:49.038
I'll use mine here.

01:37:49.042 --> 01:37:51.078
If we can connect, I may go back.

01:37:51.083 --> 01:37:52.539
Go with us now.

01:37:52.542 --> 01:37:54.498
No, I've got something to do.

01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:55.489
That's it.

01:37:55.500 --> 01:37:56.500
Hello...

01:37:57.375 --> 01:37:59.866
It's already half an hour, Mr. ding,

01:38:00.250 --> 01:38:02.662
there's nothing you can do.

01:38:03.750 --> 01:38:07.072
Fine, I'll gamble it myself.

01:38:11.125 --> 01:38:13.036
What's so funny?

01:38:13.042 --> 01:38:14.828
He overestimates himself.

01:38:26.875 --> 01:38:28.206
I'm here, fine.

01:38:28.292 --> 01:38:31.364
Please look after yu-mong for me.

01:38:31.375 --> 01:38:32.375
And...

01:38:42.167 --> 01:38:43.373
Sorry, Mr. ding, I'm late.

01:38:43.375 --> 01:38:44.831
Alright, sit down.

01:38:47.750 --> 01:38:50.457
Give me vitasoy, no, a cup of tea,

01:38:50.458 --> 01:38:51.538
with ice, please.

01:38:51.625 --> 01:38:53.490
Let's see how you're going to win.

01:38:56.833 --> 01:38:57.663
What?

01:38:57.667 --> 01:39:00.739
Who said you're gambling today? Get lost!

01:39:00.750 --> 01:39:02.115
Who's going to gamble?

01:39:02.125 --> 01:39:05.697
A famous French.

01:39:05.833 --> 01:39:09.781
The French god of gamblers, Pierre cashon!

01:39:20.333 --> 01:39:21.743
The French god of gamblers?

01:39:24.125 --> 01:39:25.911
So what am I doing here?

01:39:26.750 --> 01:39:28.206
Take my shoes.

01:39:32.833 --> 01:39:35.119
The French god of gamblers
has special power.

01:39:39.833 --> 01:39:40.868
He seem more powerful than tai-kun.

01:39:40.875 --> 01:39:41.614
Yes.

01:39:41.833 --> 01:39:42.948
Can you manage?

01:39:43.708 --> 01:39:44.993
I'll do my best.

01:39:48.833 --> 01:39:50.994
Each side has chips worth
10 million francs.

01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:52.536
The one who lose all is the loser.

01:39:57.625 --> 01:39:59.115
I've to test the cards.

01:40:07.167 --> 01:40:08.327
Wonderful!

01:40:11.667 --> 01:40:13.123
The cards are fine.

01:40:15.833 --> 01:40:16.913
My turn!

01:40:34.083 --> 01:40:35.619
That's no big deal.

01:40:44.167 --> 01:40:45.577
Fine for me too.

01:40:48.875 --> 01:40:50.331
The gamble starts.

01:41:01.750 --> 01:41:07.120
French god of gamblers,
with all your chips!

01:41:08.667 --> 01:41:10.498
The same move.

01:41:10.500 --> 01:41:13.287
This is me.

01:41:16.458 --> 01:41:18.198
Fine.

01:41:48.792 --> 01:41:50.282
Well?! â€œWhat?

01:41:51.167 --> 01:41:52.167
Nothing.

01:41:52.958 --> 01:41:55.995
Mutual interference of special power.

01:41:56.333 --> 01:41:59.871
Again, queen! I want queen!

01:42:12.125 --> 01:42:14.207
Who's that? Looks ridiculous!

01:42:15.583 --> 01:42:18.575
I don't want a girl, I want queen.

01:42:18.583 --> 01:42:20.039
Q!

01:43:04.708 --> 01:43:08.075
Damn, I've used up all my power.

01:43:12.208 --> 01:43:14.324
Open the cards.

01:43:14.708 --> 01:43:16.369
Fine, you first!

01:43:16.375 --> 01:43:17.535
You first!

01:43:17.875 --> 01:43:18.864
You first!

01:43:18.875 --> 01:43:20.706
So you're not opening your cards?

01:43:20.708 --> 01:43:22.744
You first!

01:43:22.750 --> 01:43:24.240
I don't want to go first.

01:43:24.333 --> 01:43:27.075
Let's not gamble. Let's
divide the money up.

01:43:27.958 --> 01:43:29.289
That's good idea!

01:43:30.292 --> 01:43:31.532
What are you two doing?

01:43:31.542 --> 01:43:34.284
Kids shouldn't interfere
with adults' business.

01:43:35.083 --> 01:43:37.074
We're not opening the cards. Break even.

01:43:37.208 --> 01:43:38.368
Stop the cards, another game.

01:43:40.125 --> 01:43:41.125
Are you alright?

01:43:42.042 --> 01:43:43.703
My power has used up for the moment.

01:43:43.708 --> 01:43:44.447
What?

01:43:44.625 --> 01:43:47.332
Don't worry, the same for him.

01:43:47.875 --> 01:43:50.207
I have to bet with him without using power.

01:43:50.208 --> 01:43:51.414
See who's the lucky one.

01:43:58.458 --> 01:43:59.368
You bid.

01:43:59.375 --> 01:44:01.115
All your chips out.

01:44:01.125 --> 01:44:02.706
Sorry, it's not your turn yet.

01:44:03.208 --> 01:44:04.493
Yours only a "2".

01:44:05.958 --> 01:44:06.697
Please bid!

01:44:06.708 --> 01:44:07.868
All chips out!

01:44:07.875 --> 01:44:11.868
Good.

01:44:12.083 --> 01:44:14.369
Fine. Chips out too.

01:44:15.792 --> 01:44:17.828
Can I hold half of them?

01:44:17.833 --> 01:44:18.913
No way!

01:44:19.500 --> 01:44:21.661
Of course I know.

01:44:32.208 --> 01:44:33.948
Hold it, I want something larger.

01:44:34.708 --> 01:44:36.790
Large? My head!

01:44:36.792 --> 01:44:39.784
You're right. I want your head.

01:44:40.250 --> 01:44:43.788
Miss yu-San was killed by this beast.

01:44:43.792 --> 01:44:47.910
So I'm betting with my head on hers.

01:44:48.292 --> 01:44:49.281
You're cr az y!

01:44:49.292 --> 01:44:51.749
Afraid? So we're the winners.

01:44:55.083 --> 01:44:57.199
Fine, bet on your head.

01:44:57.375 --> 01:44:58.205
Miss...

01:44:58.208 --> 01:44:59.539
Stop it!

01:44:59.542 --> 01:45:02.158
You should prepare to risk your life.

01:45:02.167 --> 01:45:03.703
Since we've paid you so much.

01:45:14.083 --> 01:45:18.247
Stop looking around, it's with me.

01:45:18.250 --> 01:45:20.081
A suit is larger, my friend.

01:45:21.375 --> 01:45:23.036
How about this?

01:45:33.042 --> 01:45:39.322
I want you, your family,

01:45:39.958 --> 01:45:42.791
that Japanese lady over there,

01:45:42.792 --> 01:45:47.331
all your relatives...

01:45:47.333 --> 01:45:53.829
Your ancestors, and all
their heads, excuse me!

01:45:55.708 --> 01:45:57.573
Use your power and change the card.

01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:00.115
Quick!

01:46:00.292 --> 01:46:01.828
You'll get rewards if I win.

01:46:04.375 --> 01:46:06.115
Fine, I'll use my power.

01:46:21.500 --> 01:46:22.535
Don't.

01:46:27.167 --> 01:46:28.748
Remember me?

01:46:30.917 --> 01:46:33.357
I've used my power and given your "heart 3"
to the other side.

01:46:33.708 --> 01:46:36.450
They've got a suit. You take care.

01:46:43.333 --> 01:46:46.575
Fine, you curse my relatives. Same to you.

01:46:46.583 --> 01:46:47.789
A suit.

01:46:47.792 --> 01:46:51.114
Mr. chow sing Cho, please open your cards.

01:47:07.833 --> 01:47:08.868
Open...

01:47:09.792 --> 01:47:12.158
Open your cards!

01:47:12.167 --> 01:47:13.407
Ready to open?

01:47:22.417 --> 01:47:24.533
I will, but wait.

01:47:25.125 --> 01:47:27.332
Ladies and gentlemen, anybody here...

01:47:27.333 --> 01:47:29.949
Called "comment allez-vous"?

01:47:29.958 --> 01:47:32.199
Please stand up!

01:47:32.583 --> 01:47:34.164
Mr. ding, do you know such person?

01:47:34.167 --> 01:47:35.247
What do you want him for?

01:47:35.750 --> 01:47:36.705
It's difficult to explain.

01:47:36.708 --> 01:47:38.573
I must have him to win this game.

01:47:38.583 --> 01:47:40.323
You yourself is "comment allez-vous"?

01:47:40.375 --> 01:47:42.286
Stop kidding. My head
will be cut if we lose.

01:47:42.292 --> 01:47:44.248
Who's kidding? Look!

01:47:45.625 --> 01:47:47.206
French god of gamblers Pierre cashon

01:47:47.208 --> 01:47:49.950
versus Chinese Saint of gamblers
"comment allez-vous".

01:47:52.667 --> 01:47:53.998
When did I have such a name?

01:47:54.083 --> 01:47:55.698
Spring told me that...

01:47:55.708 --> 01:47:57.539
You're called "comment allez-vous".

01:47:57.542 --> 01:47:58.782
Don't you know?

01:47:58.917 --> 01:48:00.123
I am?!

01:48:03.042 --> 01:48:05.829
The book says "comment allez-vous" won.

01:48:06.125 --> 01:48:08.161
They won't lie to me.

01:48:08.167 --> 01:48:10.658
Tai-kun knows how to change cards.

01:48:10.708 --> 01:48:13.780
How can I win? The book doesn't say.

01:48:13.917 --> 01:48:16.750
Open or you'll lose. And
lose your heads too.

01:48:16.792 --> 01:48:19.534
Mr. chow sing Cho, open or you'll lose.

01:48:20.000 --> 01:48:22.332
It can't be wrong.

01:48:22.333 --> 01:48:23.573
What are you saying?

01:48:23.708 --> 01:48:26.780
Maybe Jesus gives me back a suit.

01:48:26.792 --> 01:48:27.907
Are you crazy?

01:48:27.917 --> 01:48:31.705
I think only Jesus can help you now.

01:48:35.208 --> 01:48:38.450
That's the only way.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:43.118
Jesus, help me.

01:48:52.750 --> 01:48:56.038
You want a "3", mine's a "3".

01:48:56.042 --> 01:48:59.455
It's "3", aqj23 large or "two pair" large?

01:48:59.458 --> 01:49:01.414
He's got "two pair", yours aqj23.

01:49:01.417 --> 01:49:02.497
Of course he's winning.

01:49:04.458 --> 01:49:06.119
Thank you Jesus!

01:49:06.125 --> 01:49:07.535
I'm not Jesus.

01:49:10.458 --> 01:49:11.698
Do I look like him?

01:49:12.417 --> 01:49:15.033
Why did you change cards again and again?

01:49:16.250 --> 01:49:17.535
What about this game?

01:49:17.542 --> 01:49:19.828
I'm setting you up.

01:49:21.750 --> 01:49:24.412
How much did they pay you?

01:49:24.417 --> 01:49:27.284
That's not the point.
I can't stand you anymore.

01:49:32.500 --> 01:49:34.616
I'm not a man if I don't hit you.

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:38.331
Bitch!

01:49:38.333 --> 01:49:40.369
Wong kam-kwai, give me your head!

01:49:44.333 --> 01:49:46.790
Don't move any closer.

01:49:47.083 --> 01:49:49.916
Or I'll blow his brains off.

01:49:56.000 --> 01:49:57.865
Sing expected this.

01:50:17.833 --> 01:50:19.039
I'll let you decide.

01:50:19.042 --> 01:50:21.704
Later, I won't win if not for you.

01:50:25.292 --> 01:50:26.077
How come it's so windy?

01:50:26.083 --> 01:50:28.415
They're using their power to bring me back.

01:50:28.542 --> 01:50:30.533
But I've used up all my power.
I can't connect.

01:50:31.042 --> 01:50:32.873
I'll help you one more time.

01:50:33.208 --> 01:50:34.664
Thank you so much.

01:50:35.125 --> 01:50:37.741
Mr. ding, people from my time
are bringing me back.

01:50:37.750 --> 01:50:39.490
I must go now, goodbye!

01:50:40.250 --> 01:50:40.864
Really?

01:50:40.875 --> 01:50:41.875
Yes.

01:50:43.750 --> 01:50:45.786
Sing, take care.

01:50:45.792 --> 01:50:46.792
I will.

01:50:47.792 --> 01:50:49.578
I'll tell everybody,

01:50:49.583 --> 01:50:52.541
the real ding lik is handsomer
than the one in t.V.

01:50:53.792 --> 01:50:54.827
What are you saying?

01:50:56.042 --> 01:50:57.042
I've finished my words.

01:50:59.500 --> 01:51:01.661
Tai-kun, you've helped
me, what about yourself?

01:51:01.833 --> 01:51:04.370
I'd rather stay and be rich.

01:51:04.375 --> 01:51:06.661
I'm using my power, you get prepared.

01:51:25.333 --> 01:51:27.870
Go with me, yu-mong!

01:51:30.042 --> 01:51:31.077
Quick!

01:51:40.833 --> 01:51:42.073
You're really sending him back?

01:51:42.958 --> 01:51:45.495
Yes, back to the 90's.

01:51:45.500 --> 01:51:47.456
Back to her normal self.

01:51:56.917 --> 01:51:58.327
No!

01:51:59.292 --> 01:52:00.156
What?

01:52:00.167 --> 01:52:01.498
Look.

01:52:08.875 --> 01:52:09.864
How come?

01:52:09.875 --> 01:52:11.115
She lives in the 30's.

01:52:11.125 --> 01:52:13.116
She'll die of old age in the 90's.

01:52:13.125 --> 01:52:15.081
Push her away.

01:52:22.792 --> 01:52:25.408
Sing...

01:52:31.042 --> 01:52:32.077
Mr. ding!

01:52:41.708 --> 01:52:43.198
My final wish,

01:52:43.417 --> 01:52:46.705
please take care of yu-mong for me.

01:53:05.375 --> 01:53:08.447
Don't worry, I will.

01:53:51.375 --> 01:53:52.375
Yu-mong! Yu-mong!

01:54:52.292 --> 01:54:53.657
You have to go back to U.S.A.?

01:54:53.875 --> 01:54:56.867
Yes, I'll learn gambling
from the "god of gamblers".

01:54:56.875 --> 01:54:57.990
And forget the past.

01:54:58.292 --> 01:55:01.034
Go and learn, but don't find girls.

01:55:01.042 --> 01:55:02.202
I won't.

01:55:03.375 --> 01:55:06.367
I don't think I'll fall in love again.

01:55:15.833 --> 01:55:16.833
Yee-mong?!

01:55:25.833 --> 01:55:28.074
- Yee-mong!
- Damn you!

01:55:28.083 --> 01:55:30.620
Wait for me.

01:55:30.625 --> 01:55:35.415
"Moments together, a long road ahead"

01:55:35.417 --> 01:55:39.911
"dreams flee, pain follows"

01:55:39.917 --> 01:55:44.707
"we are miles apart"

01:55:44.917 --> 01:55:48.910
"lost in tears and laughter"

01:55:51.417 --> 01:55:56.457
"and we meet again, clinging to memories"

01:55:56.458 --> 01:56:01.873
"we can but extinguish our passion"

01:56:03.333 --> 01:56:08.407
"but we meet again,
my heart has long been broken"

01:56:08.417 --> 01:56:13.616
"alas, love is bitter!"

01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:21.621
"Alas, love is bitter!"
