WEBVTT

00:03.670 --> 00:06.381
- DOUGHNUTS!
YOU'RE A SAINT.

00:06.464 --> 00:07.465
- I ATE THEM ALL.

00:07.549 --> 00:10.427
- YOU BITCH.

00:10.510 --> 00:12.887
THAT WAS TOO STRONG.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.432
I--I JUST REALLY
WANTED A DOUGHNUT.

00:15.515 --> 00:18.893
- I JUST REALLY
WANTED A DOUGHNUT.

00:18.977 --> 00:22.105
- HE REPEATS
EVERYTHING I SAY.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.940
- THEY'RE EMERGENCY DOUGHNUTS.

00:24.023 --> 00:26.151
I WAS UP ALL NIGHT,
OBSESSING ABOUT KYLE.

00:26.234 --> 00:28.945
- JOY'S PATHETIC.
SHE'LL DIE ALONE.

00:29.028 --> 00:30.113
- [laughs]

00:30.196 --> 00:33.283
WHERE DOES HE GET
THIS STUFF?

00:33.366 --> 00:37.454
- I TEXTED KYLE, EXPLAINING WHY
I DIDN'T SHOW UP LAST NIGHT

00:37.537 --> 00:40.123
AND HE TEXTED BACK,
"MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST."

00:40.206 --> 00:41.958
WHAT COULD THAT
POSSIBLY MEAN?

00:42.041 --> 00:44.294
- THAT HE THINKS
IT'S FOR THE BEST.

00:44.377 --> 00:45.962
- BUT HE SAID "MAYBE".

00:46.045 --> 00:49.090
"MAYBE IT'S FOR THE BEST,"
WHICH MEANS, "MAYBE IT WASN'T."

00:49.174 --> 00:51.968
{\an1}AND UNTIL I FIGURE THAT OUT, I
HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TO WRITE BACK.

00:52.051 --> 00:54.429
- I'M SURE YOU'LL THINK
OF THE RIGHT THING TO SAY.

00:54.512 --> 00:57.932
- JOY WILL SCREW IT UP.

00:58.016 --> 01:02.187
- THAT'S ONE BIRD'S OPINION.

01:02.270 --> 01:05.690
- GOOD MORNING.
GUESS WHY I AM IN MEN'S CLOTHES.

01:05.774 --> 01:09.194
- YOU WENT NAKED TO SEE A GUY,
YOU SLEPT WITH HIM,

01:09.277 --> 01:11.821
AND YOU BORROWED
HIS CLOTHES.

01:11.905 --> 01:15.200
- WELL IN MY MIND,
IT DIDN'T SOUND SO CHEAP.

01:15.283 --> 01:17.160
BUT IN MY DEFENSE,
I DID NOT SLEEP

01:17.243 --> 01:18.203
WITH THE MAN
I GOT NAKED FOR.

01:18.286 --> 01:21.331
I SLEPT WITH ANOTHER MAN.

01:24.584 --> 01:27.712
THAT SOUNDED EVEN SLUTTIER.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.339
BUT WE DID CLICK.

01:29.422 --> 01:30.715
- WELL, IF YOU'RE
JUST GETTING IN,

01:30.799 --> 01:34.677
YOU MUST HAVE CLICKED
MORE THAN ONCE.

01:34.761 --> 01:36.805
I GOT BACK TOGETHER
WITH MAX.

01:36.888 --> 01:39.307
- [gasps]
ELKA, THAT'S WONDERFUL!

01:39.390 --> 01:40.809
CONGRATULATIONS.

01:40.892 --> 01:41.851
JOY, HOW DID IT GO WITH KYLE?

01:41.935 --> 01:43.228
- I JUST ATE 12 DOUGHNUTS.

01:43.311 --> 01:46.481
- YOU BITCH.

01:46.564 --> 01:49.901
I'M SORRY,
I'M STILL MAD.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.362
- OH, HONEY,
I'M SO SORRY.

01:52.445 --> 01:53.363
- GOOD MORNING.

01:53.446 --> 01:57.033
- HAG ALERT,
HAG ALERT.

01:57.116 --> 01:59.661
- OH, SHUT YOUR SEED HOLE.

01:59.744 --> 02:00.787
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

02:00.870 --> 02:02.831
I THOUGHT YOU WERE GOING
TO SOUTH AMERICA WITH CLARK.

02:02.914 --> 02:04.332
- OH, I WAS.
AND IT WAS SO EXCITING.

02:04.415 --> 02:06.709
I WAS ACTUALLY FALLING
FOR HIM AGAIN.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.711
BUT THEN HE ACCUSED ME
OF BRINGING TOO MUCH LUGGAGE

02:08.794 --> 02:10.045
AND I SAID, "WELL THAT
WAS NEVER A PROBLEM

02:10.128 --> 02:11.631
FOR GINGER
FROM <i> GILLIGAN'S ISLAND."</i>

02:11.714 --> 02:13.675
AND THEN HE WANTED TO KNOW,
"WHERE IS THIS ISLAND?"

02:13.758 --> 02:15.760
AND I SAID, "WELL NOBODY KNEW,
THAT WAS THE WHOLE POINT."

02:15.844 --> 02:18.346
AND THEN, LONG STORY SHORT,
HE LEFT ME.

02:18.429 --> 02:20.431
- OH, VICTORIA, I'M SORRY.

02:20.515 --> 02:21.641
- WELL, THANK YOU.

02:21.724 --> 02:23.518
BUT AS IS CUSTOMARY
AFTER A BREAKUP,

02:23.601 --> 02:25.270
I HAVE REVENGED MYSELF.

02:25.353 --> 02:27.730
I HAVE STOLEN ONE
OF CLARK'S RARE SPIDERS

02:27.814 --> 02:32.068
WHOSE POISONOUS VENOM INSTANTLY
PARALYZES YOU FOR A FEW HOURS.

02:32.151 --> 02:33.361
- WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT?

02:33.444 --> 02:36.197
- BECAUSE IT ALSO TIGHTENS
A WOMAN'S SKIN.

02:36.281 --> 02:39.617
WHY, JUST NOW,
I ACCIDENTALLY BRUSHED A FANG

02:39.701 --> 02:44.747
WHILE MILKING HER
AND...SEE?

02:44.831 --> 02:47.542
- OH, IT'S AS SOFT
AS A BABY'S BOTTOM.

02:47.625 --> 02:51.546
- TUT-TUT-TUT,
AS A BABY'S POISON BOTTOM.

02:51.629 --> 02:53.923
HERE, GO AHEAD AND POKE IT.
I CAN'T FEEL A THING.

02:54.007 --> 02:57.093
- OH, TO NOT FEEL ANYTHING.
I WANT THAT SPIDER TO BITE ME.

02:57.176 --> 02:59.470
- WELL, INTERESTINGLY, UH,
THE CHANCES OF THAT HAPPENING

02:59.554 --> 03:02.473
HAVE GONE UP SIGNIFICANTLY
IN THE LAST HALF HOUR.

03:02.557 --> 03:05.226
- DON'T YOU DARE SAY
A SPIDER'S LOOSE.

03:05.310 --> 03:07.937
- THERE'S A SPIDER LOOSE.

03:08.021 --> 03:11.357
- WELL, I DIDN'T SAY IT.

03:19.657 --> 03:23.620
{\an8}- ELKA, MAX'S LAKE HOUSE
IS BEAUTIFUL.

03:23.703 --> 03:25.955
{\an8}WE SHOULD GET OUR HOUSE
FUMIGATED MORE OFTEN.

03:26.039 --> 03:28.791
{\an8}- OH, PLEASE,
I'M STILL IN MOURNING.

03:28.875 --> 03:32.295
{\an8}WE LEFT THAT MAGICAL SPIDER
BEHIND TO DIE BEFORE ITS--

03:32.378 --> 03:35.840
{\an8}ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO SKIN CARE
COULD BE FULLY EXPLOITED.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.926
{\an8}[phone beeps]

03:38.009 --> 03:39.928
{\an8}- OH, IT'S CASEY.
HE'S ALMOST HERE.

03:40.011 --> 03:41.304
{\an8}THANKS, YOU GUYS,
FOR LETTING ME INVITE HIM.

03:41.387 --> 03:43.932
{\an8}- I WISH MAX
COULD BE HERE.

03:44.015 --> 03:47.143
{\an8}WITHOUT A MAN THERE'S NOTHING
TO DO UP HERE BUT DRINK.

03:47.226 --> 03:49.687
{\an8}- AH, THERE'S THE MAGIC WORD.

03:49.771 --> 03:51.814
{\an8}LET'S DUMP THESE GROCERIES
AND PICK SOME BOYFRIENDS

03:51.898 --> 03:55.652
{\an8}OUT OF THE LIQUOR CABINET.

03:55.735 --> 03:57.362
{\an8}- OOH, I THINK THAT'S CASEY.

03:57.445 --> 04:00.490
{\an8}OH, I CAN'T WAIT
FOR YOU TO MEET HIM.

04:01.699 --> 04:04.035
{\an8}- THERE'S A SPIDER LOOSE.

04:04.118 --> 04:07.246
{\an8}- YOU NEED A NEW CATCHPHRASE,
BARRY.

04:07.330 --> 04:11.834
{\an8}- EAT ME.

04:11.918 --> 04:15.463
{\an8}- HI.
- HEY.

04:15.546 --> 04:18.800
{\an8}IS IT POSSIBLE YOU'VE GOTTEN
SEXIER IN THE LAST FIVE HOURS?

04:18.882 --> 04:21.511
{\an8}- WHY THANK YOU.
- HI, I'M VICTORIA.

04:21.594 --> 04:24.681
{\an8}- HI, I'M--
- KYLE!

04:24.764 --> 04:27.684
{\an8}- JOY?
- YES, IT'S ME.

04:27.767 --> 04:29.852
{\an8}OH, MY GOD,
IT'S REALLY YOU.

04:29.936 --> 04:32.397
{\an8}THIS IS KYLE,
<i>THE</i> KYLE.

04:32.480 --> 04:35.817
{\an8}- UH, WELL, UH, BUT I'M NOT
GOING BY KYLE ANYMORE.

04:35.900 --> 04:38.194
I GO BY MY INITIALS,
K.C.

04:38.277 --> 04:40.530
- OH.
WOW.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.365
INTERESTING.

04:42.448 --> 04:44.659
- I'LL SAY.

04:44.742 --> 04:46.703
- HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

04:46.786 --> 04:50.248
- UH, WELL, IT'S A--IT'S A--IT'S
A FUNNY--IT'S A FUNNY--

04:50.331 --> 04:51.874
IT'S A FUNNY STORY.

04:51.958 --> 04:55.336
- I--I GOT A HOLD
OF HIM AND--

04:55.420 --> 04:57.380
AND BROUGHT HIM UP HERE
TO SURPRISE YOU.

04:57.463 --> 04:58.715
- RIGHT, YEAH.

04:58.798 --> 05:01.050
IT--IT'S REALLY
NOT SO FUNNY "HA HA"

05:01.134 --> 05:03.594
AS IT IS FUNNY, UH...

05:03.678 --> 05:06.180
WELL, HERE WE ARE.

05:06.264 --> 05:07.557
[knock at door]

05:07.640 --> 05:09.892
- AND WHO'S THAT?
- THAT MUST BE CASEY, RIGHT?

05:09.976 --> 05:12.562
- UH, MY NEW BOYFRIEND'S NAME
IS CASEY,

05:12.645 --> 05:17.233
WHICH IS FUNNY 'CAUSE CASEY
AND K.C. ARE EASILY CONFUSED.

05:17.316 --> 05:19.444
SO WE BETTER CALL YOU "KYLE."

05:19.527 --> 05:24.240
- GOOD, 'CAUSE WE WOULDN'T WANT
THINGS TO BE CONFUSING.

05:24.323 --> 05:28.745
- HI, HAVE YOU HEARD
THE GOOD TIDINGS?

05:28.828 --> 05:31.330
- YES, YOU'RE HERE.

05:31.414 --> 05:33.583
MY NEW BOYFRIEND, CASEY.

05:33.666 --> 05:38.171
I CERTAINLY CALL
THAT GOOD TIDINGS.

05:44.886 --> 05:45.803
- I'M NOT REALLY SURE
WHAT'S HAPPENING.

05:45.887 --> 05:49.599
- WHAT'S HAPPENING IS
YOU MUST BE STARVING.

05:49.682 --> 05:54.812
SO LET'S GET YOU
IN THE KITCHEN...BABY.

05:54.896 --> 05:56.564
- THE RAPTURE
IS RAPIDLY APPROACHING.

05:56.647 --> 05:57.899
- [chuckles]

05:57.982 --> 05:59.734
OH,
YOU AND THOSE DOUBLE-ENTENDRES.

05:59.817 --> 06:02.737
YOU SEE WHY I'M CRAZY
ABOUT HIM?

06:02.820 --> 06:06.491
- OH, HELLO MA'AM,
HAVE YOU HEARD THE GOOD NEWS?

06:06.574 --> 06:10.828
- I THINK
I'M LOOKING AT IT.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.081
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.
YOUR NAME IS CASEY.

06:13.164 --> 06:15.458
WE MET LAST NIGHT,
AND NOW YOU'RE MY BOYFRIEND.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.085
- IS THIS A CULT?

06:17.168 --> 06:19.253
THE HIGH MASTER
WARNED US ABOUT CULTS.

06:19.337 --> 06:22.965
- OH, NO, NO, I PROMISE
THIS ISN'T A CULT, NO.

06:23.049 --> 06:24.425
YOU JUST HAVE TO FOLLOW
MY ORDERS EXACTLY,

06:24.509 --> 06:27.970
AND YOU CAN'T LEAVE.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.098
- LOOK, JOY, UH...

06:30.181 --> 06:34.769
I OWE YOU A--
A LONG OVERDUE APOLOGY AND, UH,

06:34.852 --> 06:36.687
MORE IMPORTANTLY,
AN EXPLANATION.

06:36.771 --> 06:40.149
- ACTUALLY, I'M STILL
OVERWHELMED BY THE SURPRISE.

06:40.233 --> 06:41.651
I DON'T THINK I'M READY
TO DO THAT JUST YET.

06:41.734 --> 06:43.277
- OH, THANK GOD.

06:43.361 --> 06:46.155
I MEAN...
WHEN YOU'RE READY.

06:46.239 --> 06:47.323
- I STILL DON'T GET IT.

06:47.406 --> 06:48.991
- OKAY,
THAT GUY OUT THERE

06:49.075 --> 06:51.119
WAS "A LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT"
THING FOR ME LAST NIGHT.

06:51.202 --> 06:52.161
BUT IT TURNS OUT HE'S THE GUY
THAT LEFT MY FRIEND

06:52.245 --> 06:53.371
MY FRIEND JOY
AT THE ALTAR.

06:53.454 --> 06:58.292
- BEFORE YOU TELL JOY, YOU MIGHT
WANNA SOFTEN IT WITH A JOKE.

06:58.376 --> 07:00.044
LIKE, UH...

07:00.128 --> 07:04.674
IT SEEMS THERE WAS
AN ASSAULTED PEANUT--

07:04.757 --> 07:07.510
OH, CRAP,
I TOLD IT WRONG.

07:07.593 --> 07:09.137
- I'M NOT GONNA TELL HER.

07:09.220 --> 07:12.181
NOBODY IS EVER AND IT'S ALL
GONNA TURN OUT JUST FINE.

07:12.265 --> 07:13.349
- THIS IS A DISASTER.

07:13.432 --> 07:15.226
HOW COULD YOU NOT KNOW
THAT CASEY WAS KYLE?

07:15.309 --> 07:20.106
- SWEET GREATNESS IN THE SKY,
IT'S VICTORIA CHASE.

07:22.108 --> 07:23.359
- LAST NIGHT WHEN I MET HIM--

07:23.442 --> 07:26.279
- IN A MINUTE.

07:26.362 --> 07:27.572
ARE YOU A FAN?

07:27.655 --> 07:29.740
- I USED TO RUSH
THROUGH MY WOOD-CHOPPING CHORES

07:29.824 --> 07:31.367
SO I WOULDN'T MISS A SECOND
OF <i> EDGE OF TOMORROW.</i>

07:31.450 --> 07:33.494
- OH, WHAT A...

07:33.578 --> 07:35.413
POWERFUL STORY.

07:35.496 --> 07:37.707
- OKAY, LISTEN UP.
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO.

07:37.790 --> 07:38.916
THIS NICE RELIGIOUS PERSON--

07:39.000 --> 07:40.668
- HEAVENLY WITNESS, MA'AM.
- SUPER.

07:40.751 --> 07:43.921
IS GOING TO SPEND THE NIGHT
AND BE MY BOYFRIEND, CASEY.

07:44.005 --> 07:47.008
- UH, I'M SORRY.
I AM SO CONFUSED.

07:47.091 --> 07:49.343
I SHOULD ASK A HIGHER POWER.

07:49.427 --> 07:51.345
WHAT WOULD YOU DO,
VICTORIA CHASE?

07:51.429 --> 07:52.346
- I WOULD DO IT.

07:52.430 --> 07:54.891
- THEN I'M IN.

07:54.974 --> 07:56.851
- I CAN HELP YOU
WITH THOSE, MELANIE.

07:56.934 --> 07:58.269
- NO, NO, THAT'S OKAY.
YOU STAY HERE WITH JOY.

07:58.352 --> 08:00.354
CASEY WILL HELP ME.
CASEY. CASEY!

08:00.438 --> 08:04.650
- UH, I'M CASEY.

08:08.029 --> 08:10.114
- OKAY.

08:10.198 --> 08:12.074
ALL THROUGH DINNER,
I WAS HOLDING THIS IN,

08:12.158 --> 08:15.411
BUT I'M JUST GONNA SAY IT.
I AM SO MAD AT YOU.

08:15.494 --> 08:17.079
- I KNOW.

08:17.163 --> 08:19.749
- BUT NOT FOR WHAT YOU THINK
I'M MAD AT YOU FOR.

08:19.832 --> 08:21.751
I'M MAD
BECAUSE I CAN'T GET MAD AT YOU.

08:21.834 --> 08:25.379
FOR 25 YEARS I'VE BEEN CARRYING
AROUND ALL THIS ANGER,

08:25.463 --> 08:28.758
AND NOW ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
IS HOW GOOD YOU LOOK.

08:28.841 --> 08:31.093
COULDN'T YOU BE
BALD AND FAT?

08:31.177 --> 08:34.804
- WELL, I'VE HAD TWO DESSERTS,
GIVE IT TIME.

08:36.349 --> 08:41.729
- I JUST HAVE SO MANY
MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT YOU...

08:41.812 --> 08:45.274
ALTHOUGH IT'S KIND OF OBVIOUS
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT ME.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.734
- IT IS?

08:46.817 --> 08:49.737
- I MEAN, A GUY WOULDN'T
DRIVE ALL THE WAY UP HERE

08:49.820 --> 08:52.073
TO SEE A GIRL UNLESS
HE REALLY CARED ABOUT HER.

08:52.156 --> 08:54.283
- I GUESS THAT'S TRUE.

08:54.367 --> 08:56.827
- AND I GUESS
SHE WOULDN'T LET HIM STAY

08:56.911 --> 09:00.414
UNLESS SHE FELT
A LITTLE SOMETHING TOO.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.501
- I'M SORRY,
WHAT WAS THAT?

09:03.584 --> 09:04.669
- GOOD NIGHT, ALL.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.254
CASEY, I'LL SHOW YOU
TO YOUR ROOM.

09:06.337 --> 09:08.506
- I CAN HANDLE IT, VICTORIA.

09:08.589 --> 09:09.799
- WELL, IF YOU GET
LOST IN THE NIGHT,

09:09.882 --> 09:14.345
I CAN HANDLE IT
RIGHT NEXT DOOR.

09:14.428 --> 09:17.473
- WELL, I GUESS
WE SHOULD TURN IN TOO.

09:17.557 --> 09:19.350
ME...UP THERE.

09:19.433 --> 09:20.977
ALL ALONE.

09:21.060 --> 09:24.939
YOU, HERE ON THE COUCH,
EQUALLY ALONE.

09:25.022 --> 09:28.025
WELL,<i> BUONA NOTTE.</i>

09:31.487 --> 09:34.865
I THINK I MIGHT BE GETTING
A LITTLE COMPANY TONIGHT.

09:34.949 --> 09:37.910
OH, WOULDN'T IT BE GREAT IF
I HAD WHAT YOU HAVE WITH CASEY?

09:37.994 --> 09:39.829
- OH, YEAH, GOOD OL--
CASEY!

09:39.912 --> 09:42.915
- THAT'S ME!

09:45.084 --> 09:48.129
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

10:05.980 --> 10:08.065
- JUST THINK,
TONIGHT I'M GOING TO HAVE

10:08.149 --> 10:10.860
STRONG SEX
WITH VICTORIA CHASE.

10:10.943 --> 10:12.028
- JUST DON'T GET CAUGHT.

10:12.111 --> 10:15.531
- OH, BEFORE I LEAVE, I NEED
TO MENTALLY PREPARE MYSELF.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.034
HAVE YOU EVER SEEN
VICTORIA CHASE NAKED?

10:18.117 --> 10:22.204
- UH, YEAH, BUT SHE WAS
COVERED IN MUD AT A SPA.

10:22.288 --> 10:27.376
- OH, TO BE A WORM
IN THAT MUD.

10:27.460 --> 10:31.630
- YEAH.
PLEASE JUST GO.

10:45.686 --> 10:48.481
- STRONG SEX
WITH VICTORIA CHASE.

11:03.746 --> 11:06.415
[knock on door]

11:06.499 --> 11:09.919
- KYLE, YOU CAME--

11:10.002 --> 11:11.837
GO AWAY.

11:11.921 --> 11:14.006
- THERE'S NO HEAT
IN MY ROOM.

11:14.090 --> 11:17.760
I NEED SOME PLACE TO PUT
MY COLD, ANCIENT FEET.

11:17.843 --> 11:19.470
- SADLY, I'VE FALLEN
FOR THAT LINE BEFORE.

11:19.553 --> 11:24.100
COME IN.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.768
BUT IF KYLE SHOWS UP,
YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

11:25.851 --> 11:28.604
- I'LL TAKE THOSE ODDS.

11:36.862 --> 11:38.948
- KYLE,
GET OUT OF MY BED!

11:39.031 --> 11:41.075
- I--I--I JUST WANNA
TALK TO YOU.

11:41.158 --> 11:42.785
OH, YEAH,
AND KISS YOU...

11:42.868 --> 11:45.371
AND HAVE SEX WITH YOU.

11:45.454 --> 11:46.747
- NO, YOU'VE ALREADY
TURNED ME

11:46.831 --> 11:49.250
INTO SOME SLUTTY
HIGH-SCHOOL GIRL WHO'S CHEATING

11:49.333 --> 11:50.459
WITH HER
BEST FRIEND'S BOYFRIEND.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.795
- WELL, IF YOU'RE TRYING TO TURN
ME OFF, IT'S NOT WORKING.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.463
- NO, STOP BEING CUTE
AND FUNNY.

11:54.547 --> 11:57.174
- OW.
OW.

11:57.258 --> 11:58.676
- OH, COME ON, I DIDN'T
HIT YOU THAT HARD.

11:58.759 --> 12:01.971
- NO, NO.
SOMETHING JUST BIT ME.

12:02.054 --> 12:06.434
I CAN'T MOVE MY LEGS.

12:06.517 --> 12:11.147
- AND THEY'RE GETTING
SO SMOOTH AND YOUTHFUL.

12:11.230 --> 12:14.942
OH, MY GOD,
VICTORIA'S SPIDER.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.319
GUYS,
YOU HAVE TO HELP ME.

12:17.403 --> 12:19.196
KYLE'S IN MY ROOM,
STIFF AS A BOARD.

12:19.280 --> 12:22.533
- WELL, WHAT A COINCIDENCE.

12:22.616 --> 12:25.244
- YOUR SPIDER BIT HIM.
HE'S PARALYZED.

12:25.327 --> 12:26.662
- MY SPIDER--
SHE'S HERE?

12:26.745 --> 12:28.831
- YES, WE HAVE TO GET KYLE
OUT OF MY ROOM.

12:28.914 --> 12:30.499
IT'LL CRUSH JOY
IF SHE FINDS HIM IN THERE.

12:30.583 --> 12:31.834
SO I'M GONNA KEEP
A LOOKOUT FOR HER

12:31.917 --> 12:33.169
AND THEN YOU GUYS DRAG
HIM DOWN TO THE SOFA.

12:33.252 --> 12:35.379
- WELL, WHY CAN'T I KEEP
A LOOKOUT AND YOU DRAG?

12:35.463 --> 12:38.174
- BECAUSE YOU'RE STRONGER THAN
I AM. LOOK AT YOUR TONED ARMS.

12:38.257 --> 12:40.176
- OH, THESE ARMS
ARE FOR SHOW.

12:40.259 --> 12:41.051
THE ONLY THINGS
THEY CARRY

12:41.135 --> 12:44.513
ARE LESSER ACTORS
THROUGH BIG SCENES.

12:46.599 --> 12:50.186
- YOU KNOW, BETWEEN THIS
AND JAIL AND THE ZOO,

12:50.269 --> 12:52.354
WE SURE SLEEP TOGETHER
A LOT.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.524
- THAT THOUGHT IS SCARIER
THAN THIS BOOK.

12:58.611 --> 13:02.239
YOU IDIOT,
DON'T GO IN THERE.

13:02.323 --> 13:04.492
CALLED IT.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.745
OH, YOU DESERVE TO HAVE
YOUR BRAINS EATEN.

13:07.828 --> 13:10.039
OH, I HATE THIS BOOK.

13:10.122 --> 13:13.209
- THEN WHY DON'T YOU
STOP READING IT?

13:13.292 --> 13:16.545
- IT'S BAD FOR ME,
BUT I'M ATTRACTED TO IT.

13:16.629 --> 13:20.591
REMIND YOU OF ANYBODY?

13:20.674 --> 13:22.551
- POINT TAKEN.

13:22.635 --> 13:24.845
BUT I DON'T KNOW IF KYLE
IS GOOD OR BAD FOR ME.

13:24.929 --> 13:27.056
- HE STOOD YOU UP
AT THE ALTAR.

13:27.139 --> 13:29.934
- AND I STILL DON'T KNOW WHY...

13:30.017 --> 13:31.685
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID TO ASK.

13:31.769 --> 13:35.898
I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ALL THE REASONS I WAS UNLOVABLE.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.275
I JUST WANT HIM
TO WANT ME AGAIN.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.777
- AND THIS GUY
JUST WANTS

13:39.860 --> 13:42.446
TO SMEAR A LITTLE BRAINS
ON A CRACKER.

13:42.530 --> 13:45.866
EVERYBODY
HAS THEIR DREAMS.

13:45.950 --> 13:47.785
- I'M SORRY ABOUT THIS,
AND I'M SORRY

13:47.868 --> 13:49.453
ABOUT VICTORIA DROPPING
YOU ON THE STAIRS.

13:49.537 --> 13:53.123
- I TOLD YOU THESE ARMS
WERE FOR SHOW.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.751
- GOOD NIGHT.
- GOOD NIGHT.

13:55.834 --> 13:57.419
- CAN I KEEP CASEY?

13:57.503 --> 13:59.630
- YES, HAVE STRONG SEX
WITH CASEY.

13:59.713 --> 14:02.508
- LET'S DO IT RIGHT HERE.

14:08.138 --> 14:09.890
- UH, GUYS?

14:09.974 --> 14:13.060
I'M STILL ALIVE.

14:13.143 --> 14:14.770
- OH, UH,
HE'S RIGHT.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.481
WE SHOULD PROBABLY GO TO
OUR ROOM BUT NOT EMPTY-HANDED.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.566
- A BOTTLE OF WINE?

14:18.649 --> 14:21.610
- AMEN.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
- UH, EXCUSE ME?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.823
COULD YOU HELP PROP ME UP
ON MY PILLOWS, PLEASE?

14:25.906 --> 14:28.701
- OH, YEAH, SURE.

14:31.579 --> 14:33.122
- I'M NOT GONNA DIE,
AM I?

14:33.205 --> 14:35.457
- I DOUBT IT, BUT IF YOU DO,
AFTER WHAT YOU DID TO JOY,

14:35.541 --> 14:36.500
YOU'D PROBABLY DESERVE IT.

14:36.584 --> 14:40.296
YOU KNOW, PEOPLE TEND
TO GET WHAT THEY DESERVE.

14:40.379 --> 14:45.259
OH, SOMETHING BIT ME.

14:47.428 --> 14:49.471
- THERE'S A SPIDER LOOSE.

14:49.555 --> 14:53.142
- YEAH, BARRY,
WE GOT THAT.

14:53.225 --> 14:55.728
- BARRY, ARE YOU OKAY?
- CLARK.

14:55.811 --> 14:57.271
- VICTORIA!

14:57.354 --> 15:01.483
- UH, CLARK...IT ISN'T
WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE.

15:01.567 --> 15:05.321
- STRONG SEX
WITH VICTORIA CHASE.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.947
- HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

15:07.031 --> 15:08.991
- TRACKING CHIP
IN BARRY.

15:09.074 --> 15:11.118
AND TO THINK
I CAME BACK FOR YOU.

15:11.201 --> 15:14.079
- OH, LOOK, CLARK, UM,
THIS MAN IS NOT MY LOVER.

15:14.163 --> 15:15.497
- I DON'T EVEN
FIND HER ATTRACTIVE.

15:15.581 --> 15:17.833
- ALL RIGHT, THAT IS NOT
NECESSARY INFORMATION.

15:17.916 --> 15:20.628
- SHE IS THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
WOMAN IN THE WORLD,

15:20.711 --> 15:24.131
AND I WILL FIGHT ANY MAN
WHO TRIES TO TAKE HER FROM ME.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.549
- WELL, THEN YOU'LL
HAVE TO FIGHT ME.

15:25.633 --> 15:28.344
- OH...UH...

15:28.427 --> 15:31.221
WELL I MIGHT HAVE TO DO
A BIT OF STRETCHING FIRST.

15:31.305 --> 15:33.307
- CLARK, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO FIGHT ANYONE.

15:33.390 --> 15:37.353
LOOK AT YOU,
SOUNDING ALL JEALOUS AND SEXY.

15:37.436 --> 15:40.022
- OH, VICTORIA,
GIVE ME A HUG.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.150
- UH, A LITTLE HELP
WITH THE ARMS.

15:43.233 --> 15:45.694
- WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU'RE PARALYZED.

15:45.778 --> 15:46.987
- NO, I'M NOT.

15:47.071 --> 15:49.782
- YOU STOLE MY SPIDER!
- NO, I DIDN'T.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.325
- THEN STAND UP.

15:51.408 --> 15:55.537
- I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT.

15:55.621 --> 15:59.375
- YOU SELFISH, SPIDER-STEALING
SHE-DEMON!

15:59.458 --> 16:01.377
- DON'T YOU TALK TO THE WOMAN
I LOVE THAT WAY.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.630
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"THE WOMAN YOU LOVE"?

16:04.713 --> 16:08.050
- COULD SOMEBODY GET THE WOMAN
THEY LOVE OFF OF ME?

16:08.133 --> 16:09.677
- WHAT IS GOING ON OUT HERE?

16:09.760 --> 16:11.887
OH...BOY.

16:11.970 --> 16:13.931
- YOUR BOYFRIEND JUST SAID
HE'S IN LOVE WITH VICTORIA.

16:14.014 --> 16:15.349
- I'M NOT HER BOYFRIEND.

16:15.432 --> 16:17.226
- WELL, OF COURSE NOT,
NOW THAT I KNOW

16:17.309 --> 16:18.769
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH VICTORIA!

16:18.852 --> 16:21.647
HOW COULD YOU?!

16:23.816 --> 16:25.901
OKAY, THAT'S DONE,
GOOD NIGHT, EVERYBODY.

16:25.984 --> 16:27.403
- ALL RIGHT,
WHAT'S GOING ON?

16:27.486 --> 16:29.238
EVERYONE SEEMS
TO KNOW EXCEPT ME.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.282
- [sighs]
JOY--

16:32.366 --> 16:34.076
- I'VE GOT THIS.

16:34.159 --> 16:37.788
JOY, THESE TWO PEANUTS
WENT ON A SALTY--

16:37.871 --> 16:41.375
CRAP,
THAT'S NOT RIGHT EITHER.

16:41.458 --> 16:43.627
- WOULD SOMEBODY
PLEASE JUST TELL ME?

16:43.711 --> 16:47.047
- OKAY, BUT IT'S GONNA HURT,
SO I'M GONNA TELL IT FAST,

16:47.131 --> 16:49.800
LIKE PULLING OFF
A BAND-AID.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.052
LAST NIGHT I MET KYLE, BUT I
THOUGHT HE WAS CASEY, NOT K.C.,

16:52.136 --> 16:53.554
AND HE CAME UP HERE
TO SEE ME, NOT YOU,

16:53.637 --> 16:54.513
AND AS SOON AS I FOUND OUT
WHO HE WAS,

16:54.596 --> 16:55.305
I DIDN'T WANNA HAVE ANYTHING
TO DO WITH HIM.

16:55.389 --> 16:58.559
I'M SO, SO, SO SORRY.
- ME TOO.

16:58.642 --> 17:01.311
THE LAST THING I WANTED
TO DO WAS HURT YOU...

17:01.395 --> 17:02.563
AGAIN.

17:02.646 --> 17:04.064
- AND I'M ONLY
ON TOP OF HIM

17:04.147 --> 17:07.943
BECAUSE WE BOTH GOT BIT
BY MY SPIDER.

17:08.026 --> 17:10.863
NOW COULD SOMEONE PLEASE MOVE ME
INTO A MORE DIGNIFIED POSITION?

17:10.945 --> 17:13.323
- I'LL DO IT.
- I'LL DO IT.

17:13.406 --> 17:14.907
- NO, I'VE GOT HER.

17:14.992 --> 17:17.493
- I'VE GOT HER.
- NO, I'VE GOT HER.

17:17.578 --> 17:20.789
GIVE HER TO ME!
SHE'S MINE.

17:20.873 --> 17:23.459
[grunting]

17:23.541 --> 17:24.792
- THERE.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.130
THERE.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.966
- LEGS TOGETHER, PLEASE.
- YEAH.

17:38.974 --> 17:41.143
- CONTINUE.

17:41.226 --> 17:43.979
- I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.981
WHY DID YOU AGREE TO MEET ME
ON TOP OF THE TOWER?

17:46.064 --> 17:48.525
- WELL, I WAS IN A CONFUSED
AND DESPERATE PLACE,

17:48.609 --> 17:49.610
AND WHEN YOU GOT IN TOUCH
WITH ME,

17:49.693 --> 17:51.987
I THOUGHT,
"MAYBE IT'S A SIGN."

17:52.070 --> 17:55.491
SO I CALLED OFF MY MARRIAGE
AND I--I CAME TO SEE YOU.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.659
- YOU LEFT SOMEONE ELSE
AT THE ALTAR?

17:57.743 --> 18:00.621
- I CAN'T HELP IT.
I PANIC.

18:00.704 --> 18:03.123
I THOUGHT MAYBE IF WE
RECONNECTED, YOU COULD FIX ME.

18:03.207 --> 18:05.834
AND THEN WHEN YOU WEREN'T
THERE AND I MET MELANIE,

18:05.918 --> 18:08.670
I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WAS
A SIGN AND SHE COULD FIX ME.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.548
- I KNOW A VET
WHO COULD FIX YOU.

18:14.092 --> 18:15.844
- HOW MANY TIMES
HAVE YOU DONE THIS?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.888
- OH...FOUR.

18:17.971 --> 18:20.474
FIVE IF YOU INCLUDE JOY.

18:20.557 --> 18:24.061
- SO, FOR THE PAST 25 YEARS,
YOU'VE JUST BEEN JUMPING

18:24.144 --> 18:26.021
FROM WOMAN TO WOMAN,
HOPING THE NEXT ONE

18:26.105 --> 18:27.648
WILL SOLVE
ALL YOUR PROBLEMS?

18:27.731 --> 18:30.234
- I GUESS I'M JUST
A HOPELESS ROMANTIC.

18:30.317 --> 18:33.195
- YOU'RE NOT A ROMANTIC,
YOU'RE PATHETIC.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.864
JOY, I'M SORRY.
- ARE YOU KIDDING?

18:35.948 --> 18:38.200
THIS IS FANTASTIC.

18:38.283 --> 18:42.496
ALL THESE YEARS, I THOUGHT IT
WAS ME, BUT IT'S YOU!

18:42.579 --> 18:45.332
YOU'RE A SELFISH,
EMOTIONALLY STUNTED BASTARD.

18:48.126 --> 18:50.379
- YES, YOU GET IT.
YOU CAN FIX ME.

18:50.462 --> 18:52.714
WE CAN PUT THE MISTAKES
OF OUR PAST BEHIND US

18:52.798 --> 18:54.174
NOW THAT WE'RE FINALLY
GETTING CLOSURE.

18:54.258 --> 18:59.012
- OH, KYLE, I HAVE WAITED
SO LONG TO HEAR THAT.

19:01.181 --> 19:05.227
I WANT YOU OUT OF THIS HOUSE
RIGHT NOW.

19:05.310 --> 19:08.063
BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEST
KIND OF CLOSURE IS?

19:08.146 --> 19:10.899
DOOR CLOSURE.
- WHAT, IT'S OVER?

19:10.983 --> 19:13.944
- YOU HEARD ME.
DOOR CLOSURE.

19:14.027 --> 19:17.906
- BUT I STILL CAN'T MOVE.

19:17.990 --> 19:20.200
- WELL,
AS SOON AS YOU CAN,

19:20.284 --> 19:21.910
WE'RE GOING RIGHT BACK
TO THIS POSITION

19:21.994 --> 19:24.121
BECAUSE I JUST CAME UP
WITH THAT DOOR CLOSURE LINE,

19:24.204 --> 19:26.999
AND I OBVIOUSLY
REALLY LIKE IT.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.256
- THERE'S A SPIDER LOOSE.
- OH, SHUT UP.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.550
- SHUT UP.
- OH, QUIT IMITATING ME.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.511
- QUIT IMITATING ME.
- BARRY IS AN IDIOT.

19:39.595 --> 19:43.974
- NICE TRY, HAG.

19:44.057 --> 19:45.934
- OH, I STILL FEEL
TERRIBLE ABOUT THIS.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.145
I HOPE I DIDN'T HURT YOU.
- OH, THANK YOU.

19:48.228 --> 19:49.730
BUT I'M NOT HURT
AT ALL.

19:49.813 --> 19:54.109
OW, SOMETHING JUST BIT ME.

19:54.192 --> 19:56.778
- OH, VICTORIA'S SPIDER.
- MY SPIDER?

19:56.862 --> 19:58.113
- MY SPIDER?

19:58.196 --> 20:00.115
- OH, MY GOD,
LOOK AT HER FACE.

20:00.198 --> 20:01.241
- WHAT?

20:01.325 --> 20:03.952
- YOU LOOK 19.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.787
- I'LL GET THE ANTIVENIN.

20:05.871 --> 20:09.666
- WAIT!
- DON'T YOU DARE!

20:09.750 --> 20:11.877
JUST BRUSH MY HAIR
AND PROP ME UP

20:11.960 --> 20:14.963
IN FRONT OF THE NEAREST
FIRE STATION.
