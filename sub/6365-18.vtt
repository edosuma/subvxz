WEBVTT

00:00.001 --> 00:02.401
<i>Previously on</i> reign...

00:02.403 --> 00:05.471
They believe I'm blessed
and took me in.

00:05.473 --> 00:06.739
How did you heal
that woman's son?

00:06.741 --> 00:10.009
You saved someone
at a cost to another.

00:10.011 --> 00:11.377
Not always.

00:11.379 --> 00:13.512
Many times,
there are no consequences.

00:13.514 --> 00:14.780
Who left those marks
on your face?

00:14.782 --> 00:16.215
She earns every mark she gets.

00:16.217 --> 00:18.117
You are hereby
stripped of your title.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.052
(grunting)

00:21.554 --> 00:23.389
I want to live.
There could be a price.

00:23.391 --> 00:26.091
(grunting, groaning)

00:26.093 --> 00:28.293
You are free to be with condÃ©,

00:28.295 --> 00:30.529
But I can't control my mother's
appetite for vengeance.

00:30.531 --> 00:34.033
You are my choice,
and this is our moment.

00:34.035 --> 00:36.402
Promise me that when the day
comes, we'll get on that boat,

00:36.404 --> 00:38.504
And you'll leave
all this all behind.
Yes.

00:38.506 --> 00:40.773
Francis, you must stop her
for both of your sakes.

00:40.775 --> 00:43.108
Francis? Francis!

00:43.110 --> 00:45.244
The vision.
Nostradamus's vision.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.646
He saw how francis died.

00:47.648 --> 00:49.248
It's all coming true.

00:50.250 --> 00:52.618
(crow cawing)

00:58.625 --> 01:00.426
Catherine: Why won't
his ear stop bleeding?

01:00.428 --> 01:01.794
Is there nothing
you can do for him?

01:01.796 --> 01:03.395
It's the infection.

01:03.397 --> 01:05.364
Until his body
overcomes the disease,

01:05.366 --> 01:07.800
It will keep pushing
blood into the ear.

01:07.802 --> 01:09.301
What if he can't?

01:09.303 --> 01:11.703
Will he never stop bleeding?

01:12.806 --> 01:15.307
Will he never wake up?

01:15.309 --> 01:16.708
Tell me the truth.

01:16.710 --> 01:18.477
Well, if he can't
overcome it,

01:18.479 --> 01:20.679
If his fever won't
break, and soon,

01:20.681 --> 01:22.314
The king will die.

01:29.255 --> 01:31.690
(fast tempo acoustic
intro playing)

01:34.427 --> 01:36.862
â™ª they all need something

01:36.864 --> 01:41.733
â™ª to hold on to,
they all mean well â™ª

01:41.735 --> 01:45.304
â™ª you could never
feel my story â™ª

01:45.306 --> 01:49.241
â™ª it's all you know... Oh!

01:49.243 --> 01:52.344
â™ª

01:58.284 --> 02:00.352
(condÃ© sighs)

02:00.354 --> 02:01.787
What is it?

02:01.789 --> 02:04.289
I can't believe
I'm here with you.

02:04.291 --> 02:06.125
That you're mine.

02:06.127 --> 02:08.160
Yes, I am.

02:08.162 --> 02:10.162
But...?

02:10.164 --> 02:11.763
Do I sense regrets?

02:11.765 --> 02:15.434
No. No regrets.

02:15.436 --> 02:18.370
You helped me
find myself again.

02:18.372 --> 02:20.539
Part of myself
I thought I'd lost.

02:20.541 --> 02:22.374
Why do I feel
like a servant

02:22.376 --> 02:25.277
Who's located some
missing earring for you?

02:25.279 --> 02:27.546
Don't be like that, louis.

02:27.548 --> 02:29.648
I love you.
You must know that.

02:29.650 --> 02:33.685
You've risked your life and your
future for me time and again.

02:33.687 --> 02:38.557
You turned down elizabeth,
the chance to be a king for me.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.560
I know that you feel
my husband's presence

02:41.562 --> 02:43.562
While we're here in France,

02:43.564 --> 02:46.565
But soon we'll be gone,
in scotland together.

02:46.567 --> 02:48.934
I promise.

02:48.936 --> 02:51.436
Well, then,

02:51.438 --> 02:54.740
The sooner we get back,
the sooner we'll be on our way.

02:58.178 --> 03:00.245
(bird squawks)

03:03.616 --> 03:05.884
Lola, what's wrong?

03:05.886 --> 03:07.386
It's francis.

03:07.388 --> 03:08.887
He fell terribly ill
last night.

03:08.889 --> 03:10.622
How? Tell me everything.

03:10.624 --> 03:12.791
Apparently, he collapsed.

03:12.793 --> 03:15.460
He was burning up
and fell into unconsciousness.

03:15.462 --> 03:17.896
He hasn't woken.
Is it an infection?

03:17.898 --> 03:19.398
Are they worried he has

03:19.400 --> 03:20.632
Some kind of brain fever?

03:20.634 --> 03:21.967
I don't know,

03:21.969 --> 03:23.769
But everyone's very worried.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.837
Then I must go to him.

03:31.811 --> 03:34.546
(gasping)

03:34.548 --> 03:36.848
Welcome back.
(panting)

03:38.218 --> 03:39.618
What is this place?

03:39.620 --> 03:41.653
Where I live and work sometimes.

03:41.655 --> 03:44.223
When I'm not
with the nuns.

03:44.225 --> 03:46.391
You cleaned my wound.

03:46.393 --> 03:47.793
Stitched it myself.

03:47.795 --> 03:49.895
You're lucky that blade
stuck you where it did.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.598
A few inches difference...

03:52.600 --> 03:55.834
Well, even my gift
has its limits.

03:55.836 --> 03:59.404
Was it your gift...
Or your medicine that healed me?

03:59.406 --> 04:00.706
I saved your life.

04:00.708 --> 04:02.708
Does it matter
that much to you how?

04:02.710 --> 04:05.010
Yes, it does.

04:05.012 --> 04:06.979
Was I awake when you healed me?

04:06.981 --> 04:08.647
I saw my wound,
delphine.

04:08.649 --> 04:10.382
I should have died.

04:10.384 --> 04:11.717
Do you wish you had?

04:11.719 --> 04:14.253
You didn't when I found you.

04:14.255 --> 04:16.855
All you did was beg
for the pain to stop.

04:16.857 --> 04:18.390
I just want to know

04:18.392 --> 04:20.459
What the price will be
and who will pay it.

04:20.461 --> 04:23.595
If there is an answer to that,
I don't know it.

04:23.597 --> 04:25.530
The rules are unwritten.

04:25.532 --> 04:27.466
There's no way to know for sure

04:27.468 --> 04:30.602
If or when a price will be paid,
or by whom.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.271
I'm sorry.
(groans)

04:32.273 --> 04:33.805
Where's my shirt?

04:33.807 --> 04:35.407
Where do you think you're going?

04:35.409 --> 04:38.010
To find the man
who tried to kill me.

04:38.012 --> 04:39.678
He's already
been caught.

04:39.680 --> 04:41.546
What?

04:41.548 --> 04:46.785
There were witnesses
to your argument in the village.

04:46.787 --> 04:49.688
Loyal people who fear
the king and his deputy.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.757
Go there and confirm his guilt.

04:51.759 --> 04:54.626
You will see
your enemy hang.

04:59.699 --> 05:00.799
Mary:
Can he hear us?

05:00.801 --> 05:02.401
No.

05:06.839 --> 05:10.776
The physician was asking how the
king seemed before he collapsed.

05:10.778 --> 05:13.345
He says it could help him
treat francis.

05:13.347 --> 05:15.447
Was he eating? Did he seem weak?

05:15.449 --> 05:17.716
How was he sleeping?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.518
You don't know the answers,
do you?

05:20.620 --> 05:21.920
Knowing a husband's well-being--

05:21.922 --> 05:23.021
That's a wife's job.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.589
And you have chosen

05:24.591 --> 05:27.726
Not to be a wife to my son.
Catherine...

05:27.728 --> 05:29.995
Where were you last night, mary,
when the king collapsed?

05:29.997 --> 05:32.331
I was away from the castle to...

05:32.333 --> 05:33.999
I know about you and condÃ©.

05:35.335 --> 05:36.735
Do you know what told me

05:36.737 --> 05:39.338
That your infidelity
was fact and not rumor?

05:39.340 --> 05:42.474
The look of pain on my son's
face when he lied for you.

05:42.476 --> 05:45.877
To protect the woman that
he loved more than anything.

05:45.879 --> 05:47.879
We had come to an agreement.

05:47.881 --> 05:49.915
I doubt that agreement included
you abandoning your marriage

05:49.917 --> 05:51.750
And running off to scotland.

05:51.752 --> 05:53.919
Yes, I know
about that, too.

05:53.921 --> 05:55.620
So does francis.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.824
The truth of your betrayal
was the last thing that he heard

05:58.826 --> 06:00.559
Before he collapsed.

06:01.994 --> 06:05.397
Oh, I'm sorry.
Am I upsetting you?

06:05.399 --> 06:07.666
Should I not have suggested
that you did this to him?

06:07.668 --> 06:12.003
Because you make no mistake--
this is on your head.

06:12.005 --> 06:14.072
Nostradamus always said

06:14.074 --> 06:16.908
That you would be the cause
of my son's death.

06:16.910 --> 06:18.610
I never imagined
that you would

06:18.612 --> 06:20.946
Kill him by breaking his heart.

06:23.716 --> 06:26.518
(door opens, closes)

06:31.524 --> 06:33.458
(sniffles)

06:33.460 --> 06:35.427
Don't know if you can hear me,

06:35.429 --> 06:38.096
But please know,
wherever you are,

06:38.098 --> 06:41.900
I am so sorry for the pain
we've caused each other.

06:41.902 --> 06:43.969
(sniffles)

06:43.971 --> 06:46.838
I want you to live.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.441
Please, please live.

06:54.781 --> 06:56.715
(sighs)

06:59.919 --> 07:01.019
That's a good look for you.

07:01.021 --> 07:02.687
(chuckles)

07:02.689 --> 07:03.955
You going somewhere?

07:03.957 --> 07:05.857
Yes, thank goodness,

07:05.859 --> 07:07.826
And leaving
this rat trap behind.

07:07.828 --> 07:10.562
I've rented a townhouse
not far from here,

07:10.564 --> 07:11.930
And it's rather grand.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.932
A grand townhouse?

07:13.934 --> 07:15.700
How did you get the money?

07:15.702 --> 07:18.437
The business is growing, leith,
and it will grow even more

07:18.439 --> 07:19.971
Once I give it
the right setting.

07:19.973 --> 07:21.139
A brothel.

07:21.141 --> 07:23.542
The lease came up,
and I took it.

07:23.544 --> 07:26.878
I only just have enough money
for the first week's rent,

07:26.880 --> 07:28.814
But there's a group of
rich merchants arriving in town,

07:28.816 --> 07:31.082
And if I can get them there for
a party I'm throwing tonight,

07:31.084 --> 07:32.717
I will make a killing,

07:32.719 --> 07:34.453
And the business will be
off and running.

07:34.455 --> 07:36.588
But if you didn't need
to do any of this,

07:36.590 --> 07:39.624
If we could get an annulment
and marry

07:39.626 --> 07:40.892
And start a family,

07:40.894 --> 07:42.894
Would you not want
to leave all this behind?

07:42.896 --> 07:45.964
Leith... We've been over this.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.599
It's not possible.

07:47.601 --> 07:49.601
What if it was?

07:49.603 --> 07:52.471
What if I told you that I have
a very powerful friend

07:52.473 --> 07:54.005
Who could help us?

07:54.007 --> 07:57.008
I only have to do
a few tasks for him.

07:57.010 --> 07:58.743
What tasks?

07:58.745 --> 08:00.145
They'd have to be
dangerous tasks,

08:00.147 --> 08:02.013
Or they wouldn't be worth
such a favor.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.183
Leith, I never asked you
for this.

08:05.185 --> 08:06.551
Because you don't want it?

08:06.553 --> 08:08.820
I want what I have.

08:08.822 --> 08:10.522
A man I love,

08:10.524 --> 08:12.257
Not a man I have to depend on.

08:13.960 --> 08:16.795
(church bell tolling)

08:16.797 --> 08:19.531
Catherine:
Mary, a word.

08:19.533 --> 08:21.833
It's as I feared.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.702
Rumors of the king's
health have started

08:23.704 --> 08:25.504
To spread through
the castle.

08:25.506 --> 08:28.206
If news of his condition should
fall into the wrong hands...

08:28.208 --> 08:30.542
The throne room is full
of potential threats--

08:30.544 --> 08:32.978
Lords, diplomats,
all waiting for francis.

08:35.548 --> 08:37.983
I'm afraid I can't hide
the truth from my face.

08:37.985 --> 08:40.051
Catherine, wait.
Don't!

08:40.053 --> 08:41.786
Please listen.

08:41.788 --> 08:44.289
We may never know what
caused francis's illness.

08:44.291 --> 08:47.158
If I'm as responsible
as you say,

08:47.160 --> 08:48.860
I will never
forgive myself.

08:48.862 --> 08:50.929
So let me do this
one thing for you.

08:50.931 --> 08:53.231
I will talk to
the advisors.

08:53.233 --> 08:55.700
You go back to francis.

08:55.702 --> 08:59.538
When he wakes up, he would
rather see your face than mine.

09:00.840 --> 09:03.608
Mary.

09:06.679 --> 09:08.213
I'm so sorry.

09:08.215 --> 09:10.682
Is there anything
I can do?
There is.

09:10.684 --> 09:12.083
Find bash.

09:12.085 --> 09:13.752
If these are
the final hours,

09:13.754 --> 09:16.121
Bash needs to say good-bye
to his brother.

09:23.930 --> 09:25.797
Gentlemen.

09:25.799 --> 09:27.699
I'm sorry
you've been kept waiting.

09:27.701 --> 09:30.835
I fear you've been misinformed
as to our king's situation.

09:30.837 --> 09:33.705
It seems a rather
magnificent stag

09:33.707 --> 09:35.707
Did not check
the royal calendar,

09:35.709 --> 09:38.176
So our king and his
hunting companions have been met

09:38.178 --> 09:39.844
On a chase
through the woods.

09:39.846 --> 09:44.182
I will be handling any
urgent matters until his return.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.117
So if there isn't anything
terribly pressing...?

09:46.119 --> 09:47.953
No, your highness.
No.
No, your majesty.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.689
Well, I will let you know
when the king is back.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.924
Your grace.

09:56.829 --> 09:59.364
That was a fine performance.

09:59.366 --> 10:02.133
I don't doubt your concern
for your husband is real.

10:02.135 --> 10:04.803
Pity I can't say the
same for your lover.

10:04.805 --> 10:06.805
If francis dies,
condÃ© could marry you.

10:06.807 --> 10:08.873
He could become
king of scotland.

10:08.875 --> 10:11.977
But I'm sure that's the
furthest thing from your mind.

10:11.979 --> 10:14.179
Or his.

10:34.967 --> 10:36.968
I just wanted my own life.

10:36.970 --> 10:38.970
A chance to feel my heart again.

10:38.972 --> 10:41.272
I-I knew my leaving would never

10:41.274 --> 10:42.774
Be painless, but...

10:42.776 --> 10:44.643
Louis, do you really think

10:44.645 --> 10:46.978
That my betrayal has done this
to francis?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.781
He's saddened,
as any man would be.

10:49.783 --> 10:52.183
But sadness doesn't
make men bleed. Mary.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.854
Thank you, louis,
but it doesn't feel right

10:55.856 --> 10:58.189
To take comfort
in your touch right now.

10:58.191 --> 10:59.691
(doors open)

11:00.726 --> 11:02.260
Admiral sinet.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.796
Queen mary,
I'm sorry to arrive unannounced,

11:04.798 --> 11:07.666
But there's been urgent news
regarding scotland.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.401
What's happened?
The protestant
rebels in scotland

11:09.403 --> 11:11.670
Are mobilizing for
a military offensive.

11:11.672 --> 11:12.837
Against whom?

11:12.839 --> 11:14.205
Against your supporters.

11:14.207 --> 11:16.808
We expect that all
regions and lords

11:16.810 --> 11:18.343
Loyal to you
are in imminent danger.

11:18.345 --> 11:19.844
The killings have
already started

11:19.846 --> 11:21.413
As they overtake the land.

11:21.415 --> 11:24.883
Lords and ladies beheaded,
bodies left behind as a warning.

11:24.885 --> 11:27.152
How many men do these
protestants have on their side?

11:27.154 --> 11:28.920
Our intelligence indicates
that at least a thousand

11:28.922 --> 11:30.255
Are gathering
for the attack.

11:30.257 --> 11:32.190
And my half-brother, james?

11:32.192 --> 11:33.925
He explains in his dispatch.

11:33.927 --> 11:35.927
He's worked hard,
in your name,

11:35.929 --> 11:40.065
Building alliances with catholic
and protestant lords, both.

11:40.067 --> 11:42.200
Fighting to prop up
a crumbling peace.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.402
(scoffs)
England doesn't want peace.

11:44.404 --> 11:47.205
They want scottish blood
and my crown.

11:47.207 --> 11:49.340
James can't hold back the tide
any longer.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.943
He needs some show of strength
to deter your enemies

11:51.945 --> 11:54.279
And to persuade your friends
that they can win.

11:54.281 --> 11:57.816
I will bring this
to king francis's attention

11:57.818 --> 11:59.117
As soon as he returns.

11:59.119 --> 12:01.352
Your majesty.

12:06.459 --> 12:08.259
Louis, what do I do?

12:08.261 --> 12:10.795
If I don't act, then my allies
will be slaughtered

12:10.797 --> 12:12.130
And my country will be lost.

12:12.132 --> 12:13.798
Maybe we should leave now.

12:13.800 --> 12:15.066
Your people will rally
when they see their queen.

12:15.068 --> 12:17.335
We'd be sailing
into a civil war.

12:17.337 --> 12:19.170
I don't have enough men.

12:19.172 --> 12:21.372
I would need
thousands of soldiers.

12:21.374 --> 12:23.208
The only person who can command
a force of that size

12:23.210 --> 12:24.209
Is the king.

12:24.211 --> 12:27.278
Mary...

12:27.280 --> 12:31.249
With francis as he is,
right now the king is you.

12:40.826 --> 12:42.527
Your majesty,
I received your request.

12:42.529 --> 12:43.795
Good.

12:43.797 --> 12:45.497
But I wonder
if some other guard

12:45.499 --> 12:47.232
Might look after
claude today.

12:47.234 --> 12:49.200
I have an urgent matter in
town I need to attend to.

12:49.202 --> 12:50.435
Something to do
other than your job?

12:50.437 --> 12:52.036
It will only
take a few hours.

12:52.038 --> 12:53.972
Take claude with you.
That wouldn't be wise.

12:53.974 --> 12:56.374
The section of town I'm headed
is ill-suited for princesses.

12:56.376 --> 12:58.476
You don't seem
to be hearing me, leith.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.979
I trust you to do this
and not ask questions.

13:00.981 --> 13:03.848
Which is more discretion
than I trust my daughter with.

13:03.850 --> 13:06.151
Hence, in part, my request.

13:06.153 --> 13:07.519
Do you understand?

13:07.521 --> 13:10.255
Of course, your majesty.

13:10.257 --> 13:12.290
Your daughter will be kept
safe today and occupied

13:12.292 --> 13:14.125
Outside the castle walls.

13:14.127 --> 13:15.393
Francis is grateful.

13:15.395 --> 13:17.462
As am I.

13:25.037 --> 13:26.971
(groaning)

13:28.174 --> 13:31.910
(horses neighing)

13:31.912 --> 13:34.179
Driver!

13:34.181 --> 13:35.847
Driver, what's
going on?

13:36.482 --> 13:38.550
(shouts)

13:39.318 --> 13:40.518
(grunts)

13:42.154 --> 13:44.823
(grunting)

13:48.928 --> 13:50.995
(sighs)

13:53.465 --> 13:55.834
Mary: 2,000 french soldiers
to scotland

13:55.836 --> 13:58.203
Means fewer soldiers
facing England,

13:58.205 --> 13:59.904
Less on our borders
with navarre,

13:59.906 --> 14:01.339
The italian
and german territories,

14:01.341 --> 14:03.208
And those are just
our foreign threats.

14:03.210 --> 14:04.843
The potential threats.

14:04.845 --> 14:06.845
Unlike the threats
that scotland faces

14:06.847 --> 14:08.246
That are real and immediate.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.114
How can I betray
my husband's wishes,

14:10.116 --> 14:11.516
Endanger his country?

14:11.518 --> 14:13.384
A country
I have come to love, too.

14:13.386 --> 14:14.586
How can I do this?

14:14.588 --> 14:16.588
Mary, how can you not?

14:16.590 --> 14:18.456
Scotland is our home.

14:18.458 --> 14:20.859
The loyalists you'd be
protecting, many are friends.

14:20.861 --> 14:22.493
Some are family.

14:22.495 --> 14:23.995
If these rebels aren't stopped,

14:23.997 --> 14:26.431
We may not have
a country to go back to.

14:26.433 --> 14:29.133
I know it's grim logic,
but if francis were to die,

14:29.135 --> 14:31.302
In that moment,
you'd lose all power in France.

14:31.304 --> 14:33.137
The crown goes
to charles.

14:33.139 --> 14:34.973
You will have lost your chance
to send help.

14:34.975 --> 14:36.241
(doors open)

14:37.543 --> 14:40.044
I would like a moment
with my daughter-in-law.

14:40.046 --> 14:41.246
Alone.

14:47.887 --> 14:49.888
I've heard what is happening
in scotland,

14:49.890 --> 14:52.523
And while I sympathize
with your situation,

14:52.525 --> 14:54.893
I'm aware of what you
must be considering,

14:54.895 --> 14:56.394
Sending french troops.
I don't like it.

14:56.396 --> 14:58.196
Think about your allies
in scotland.

14:58.198 --> 15:01.532
Why should I stand by while
you steal my son's army

15:01.534 --> 15:03.635
To run off
with your bourbon prince?

15:03.637 --> 15:05.637
Elizabeth is building
a protestant campaign

15:05.639 --> 15:07.639
To take over scotland;
France could be next.

15:07.641 --> 15:09.107
I don't believe that.

15:09.109 --> 15:10.608
I am trying to save my country!

15:10.610 --> 15:12.610
Your country is all but lost!

15:12.612 --> 15:14.545
Do not drag us down with you!

15:14.547 --> 15:16.014
I understand
that you want to get

15:16.016 --> 15:17.282
As far away from here
as possible,

15:17.284 --> 15:20.018
But I won't let this
happen to France,

15:20.020 --> 15:21.019
To you.

15:21.021 --> 15:22.620
You may have the authority,

15:22.622 --> 15:25.056
I will move heaven and earth
to stop you.

15:28.360 --> 15:30.428
(crowd clamoring)

15:38.437 --> 15:40.405
It's the
king's deputy!

15:40.407 --> 15:41.706
He lives!

15:41.708 --> 15:44.042
My lord, is this him?

15:44.044 --> 15:45.510
Is this the villain who
tried to murder you?

15:47.112 --> 15:49.314
That's him.

15:49.316 --> 15:51.249
Magistrate: You have
been found guilty for

15:51.251 --> 15:52.717
The attempted murder
of the king's deputy.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.053
God have mercy
on your soul.

15:56.055 --> 15:57.622
(crowd cheers)

15:59.458 --> 16:00.591
Who's next?

16:00.593 --> 16:02.193
Bring out the witch!

16:07.599 --> 16:09.334
Let them see her face!

16:09.336 --> 16:11.269
A face kissed
by the devil.

16:13.973 --> 16:15.406
My god.

16:16.375 --> 16:17.742
Clarissa.

16:23.449 --> 16:27.251
I'm not a witch! I'm
not a witch, please!

16:27.253 --> 16:29.454
Bash! Bash,
you know me!

16:29.456 --> 16:31.255
Please help me.
Man:
Beat the evil from her!

16:31.257 --> 16:33.624
What proof do you have
that she's a witch?

16:33.626 --> 16:35.760
My lord, look at her face.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.296
She passed my
farm on Sunday,

16:38.298 --> 16:40.365
And by Wednesday,
my salt pork

16:40.367 --> 16:43.668
That proves nothing.
What are her crimes?

16:43.670 --> 16:45.370
This witch was
a servant, my lord.

16:45.372 --> 16:47.005
She stole from the
family she served,

16:47.007 --> 16:48.239
And fled in the night.

16:48.241 --> 16:49.707
Clarissa: I was
no servant.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.242
I was more like
a prisoner.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.111
Kept beneath the floorboards
and treated

16:53.113 --> 16:55.380
Like an animal!
No! Not today.

16:55.382 --> 16:58.783
There will be no hanging
or stoning of this girl.

16:58.785 --> 17:00.251
But she's satan's spawn!

17:00.253 --> 17:01.552
And I'm the king's deputy.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.087
So I will take her
to french court

17:03.089 --> 17:04.088
To face the king's justice.

17:04.090 --> 17:05.156
Please make way.

17:06.225 --> 17:08.159
If you take me
back to court,

17:08.161 --> 17:09.494
You haven't
saved my life.

17:09.496 --> 17:10.495
I will die there.

17:10.497 --> 17:12.030
By catherine's hand.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.032
Perhaps that's
what you deserve.

17:14.034 --> 17:15.800
You kidnapped her children;
have you forgotten?

17:15.802 --> 17:19.570
I was monstrous,
it's true.

17:19.572 --> 17:21.439
But you don't know
what it was like,

17:21.441 --> 17:23.708
Living hidden
my whole life.

17:23.710 --> 17:25.343
To have to
watch the love

17:25.345 --> 17:28.046
That those boys were
given by their mother.

17:28.048 --> 17:30.815
To realize that I had been
watching my own family.

17:30.817 --> 17:32.750
I was watching
my own mother.

17:32.752 --> 17:34.352
I went mad.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.788
You almost killed those boys,
my brothers.

17:36.790 --> 17:40.291
I regret what I did,

17:40.293 --> 17:43.194
And I will not
hurt another soul.

17:43.196 --> 17:45.063
Are you going to
let them kill me?

17:45.065 --> 17:46.731
I haven't decided
what to do yet.

17:47.733 --> 17:49.700
For now, you're coming with me.

17:49.702 --> 17:51.803
(both grunting)

17:56.842 --> 17:58.843
(panting)

17:58.845 --> 18:01.312
You're training.

18:01.314 --> 18:04.248
When we get to scotland,
I want to be ready to fight.

18:08.687 --> 18:11.122
Catherine guessed what you had
in mind, didn't she?

18:14.860 --> 18:17.462
Mary, I know you're torn,

18:17.464 --> 18:19.831
But don't let this decision
be about me or francis

18:19.833 --> 18:21.699
Or love or guilt.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.201
It's about your duty

18:23.203 --> 18:24.469
As queen of scotland.

18:24.471 --> 18:26.771
It's about all
of those things.

18:26.773 --> 18:30.274
None of which make it the
right choice to weaken France.

18:32.111 --> 18:34.879
Louis, catherine is
worried for France

18:34.881 --> 18:37.181
If I send those troops,
and she should be.

18:37.183 --> 18:38.616
I'm worried as well.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.219
There must be some other
way to stop the slaughter

18:41.221 --> 18:43.221
Of those loyal to me.

18:43.223 --> 18:45.456
Mercenaries, a private militia.

18:45.458 --> 18:47.325
There is.

18:47.327 --> 18:49.894
I know of a private army,
run by a general named renaude.

18:49.896 --> 18:51.462
With our combined forces,

18:51.464 --> 18:53.731
We might have enough men
to overtake the rebels.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.733
And why didn't you mention
this renaude to me before?

18:55.735 --> 18:57.602
Because he used
to serve narcisse,

18:57.604 --> 18:59.370
And rumor has it
he still does.

18:59.372 --> 19:03.241
If you want those men, you'll
have to go through narcisse.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.711
I still don't understand

19:06.713 --> 19:09.347
Why we keep circling
this dreary village.

19:09.349 --> 19:12.850
We've been to the jeweler
and the dressmaker.

19:12.852 --> 19:15.153
I'm just looking for
that tapestry shop.

19:15.155 --> 19:16.621
Claude:
<i>We've passed it.</i>

19:16.623 --> 19:18.756
<i>Why are you deliberately</i>
<i>wasting my time?</i>

19:18.758 --> 19:20.825
Mother asked you to, didn't she?

19:20.827 --> 19:22.360
I don't know what you mean.

19:22.362 --> 19:24.262
Why does she want me
out of the castle?

19:24.264 --> 19:26.364
Is it because
she's bedding narcisse?

19:26.366 --> 19:28.432
She wants me away from him,
doesn't she?

19:31.170 --> 19:32.236
Driver:
Whoa!

19:32.238 --> 19:33.437
I've got to run a quick errand.

19:33.439 --> 19:35.273
I'll be right back.

19:35.275 --> 19:37.275
Stay in the carriage.

19:50.389 --> 19:51.822
You.

19:51.824 --> 19:54.425
Do you know this town?
I do, majesty.

19:54.427 --> 19:57.228
Where's the last place
you'd take a princess?

20:00.299 --> 20:01.732
You.

20:01.734 --> 20:04.569
You owe the cardinal
three months' dues,

20:04.571 --> 20:06.671
And I'm here to collect.

20:06.673 --> 20:08.339
The cardinal's demands
for protection--

20:08.341 --> 20:09.941
I have nothing left to give.

20:11.843 --> 20:14.679
I enjoy this no
more than you do,

20:14.681 --> 20:17.648
But the fact is
that you owe the money.

20:25.557 --> 20:28.292
Where is princess claude?

20:30.729 --> 20:32.263
The moment I saw her,

20:32.265 --> 20:34.899
I felt a terrible
sense of dread.

20:34.901 --> 20:37.868
You considered letting those
savages stone her to death.

20:37.870 --> 20:40.371
I was pulled back from death,

20:40.373 --> 20:42.773
And then there she was,
pushed toward it

20:42.775 --> 20:44.875
In almost
the same time and place.

20:44.877 --> 20:46.777
A woman
connected to me.

20:46.779 --> 20:48.546
A woman whose fate
is also connected

20:48.548 --> 20:50.314
To someone I love by a prophecy.

20:50.316 --> 20:51.449
Connected to whom?

20:51.451 --> 20:53.017
My brother, francis.

20:53.019 --> 20:55.720
And you're afraid
now that you've spared her,

20:55.722 --> 20:57.922
You've brought a deadly prophecy

20:57.924 --> 20:59.757
Closer to the
king of France.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.759
I don't know, but I don't dare
ignore the coincidence.

21:01.761 --> 21:04.629
I need to get to the castle and
make sure he's not in danger--

21:04.631 --> 21:06.497
Danger I might have
put him in.

21:06.499 --> 21:07.898
Clarissa's not safe there.
Can she stay with you?

21:07.900 --> 21:10.568
I'll be back for her soon.
Yes.

21:16.441 --> 21:17.908
Your majesty.

21:17.910 --> 21:19.744
I don't mean
to interrupt,

21:19.746 --> 21:22.046
But I was told
you wanted to see me.

21:22.048 --> 21:23.881
Let's not waste time

21:23.883 --> 21:26.484
By pretending you don't
know what's happening.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.486
As surely catherine
has told you,

21:28.488 --> 21:29.987
I need an army.

21:29.989 --> 21:32.056
I've been informed
that you have access to one.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.524
As you're well aware,

21:33.526 --> 21:35.459
My armies were taken
by the king,

21:35.461 --> 21:38.329
Along with my lands
and my titles.

21:38.331 --> 21:40.665
You promised francis

21:40.667 --> 21:44.602
Your loyalty and your usefulness
in exchange for your life.

21:44.604 --> 21:45.936
Buying the allegiance

21:45.938 --> 21:48.539
Of a secret army
behind the king's back

21:48.541 --> 21:50.374
Is not loyalty.

21:50.376 --> 21:51.676
It's treachery.

21:51.678 --> 21:54.078
And don't try
to deny that either.

21:54.080 --> 21:56.013
Once I start looking,
I know I will find

21:56.015 --> 21:57.415
Proof of that and more.

21:57.417 --> 21:59.417
All of which
francis will hear about

21:59.419 --> 22:00.685
When he wakes.

22:00.687 --> 22:03.754
If... He wakes.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.557
You're right.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.093
Francis could die at any moment.

22:09.095 --> 22:11.562
Which is why time
is of the essence.

22:11.564 --> 22:14.765
You will deliver renaude to me
by dawn.

22:14.767 --> 22:17.702
You will tell him
that he and his men will answer

22:17.704 --> 22:20.571
To me, because today I am king.

22:20.573 --> 22:23.674
And I will punish
those who defy me.

22:24.976 --> 22:26.844
Remember your son.

22:26.846 --> 22:29.914
Do not test my power,

22:29.916 --> 22:32.983
And do not tempt my fury.

22:40.659 --> 22:42.560
(crowd chattering nearby)

22:47.799 --> 22:50.534
Get back there, wench!

22:50.536 --> 22:51.936
Woman:
No!

22:51.938 --> 22:53.738
I said no!

22:53.740 --> 22:56.073
(quietly):
Hey.

22:56.075 --> 22:58.008
Hello, friend.

22:58.010 --> 23:00.811
Come on. Come on.

23:08.053 --> 23:09.687
(gasps)

23:09.689 --> 23:11.922
Did you need a ride?

23:11.924 --> 23:13.791
I'm afraid that won't do you
much good, you little thief.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.960
I'm not a thief!
Unhand me at once!

23:15.962 --> 23:19.630
I'm on a mission from the crown
to find the king's brother.

23:19.632 --> 23:22.032
And the crown didn't bother
to give you a horse?

23:22.034 --> 23:24.602
Not too many highborn
ladies are tasked

23:24.604 --> 23:27.772
With important missions, or
travel these woods alone.

23:28.740 --> 23:31.709
Please, just let me go.

23:31.711 --> 23:32.943
Don't pass me off
to those savages

23:32.945 --> 23:34.812
Like those common whores.

23:34.814 --> 23:35.813
(laughs)

23:35.815 --> 23:37.548
Whores?

23:37.550 --> 23:39.183
Those ladies are
my lieutenants' wives,

23:39.185 --> 23:41.685
So you'd do well
not to repeat that.

23:41.687 --> 23:42.853
Wives?

23:42.855 --> 23:44.922
(laughter)

23:44.924 --> 23:47.491
I'm sorry. I thought...

23:47.493 --> 23:48.692
I know what you thought.

23:48.694 --> 23:50.561
I also know that
you're not a thief--

23:50.563 --> 23:53.631
Not with that lofty
gaze of judgment,

23:53.633 --> 23:54.598
Lady...?

23:54.600 --> 23:56.734
Kenna. Lady kenna.

23:56.736 --> 23:59.103
Those men are members
of my private army, lady kenna.

23:59.105 --> 24:01.939
I've been summoned by the castle
and will soon leave them

24:01.941 --> 24:03.808
To ride there and
take my orders.

24:03.810 --> 24:05.843
Be happy to give you
safe escort home.

24:05.845 --> 24:07.111
I can't go home.

24:07.113 --> 24:08.979
Not until I find
the king's brother.

24:08.981 --> 24:10.781
I can't leave
a beautiful noblewoman

24:10.783 --> 24:12.583
To wander out here all alone.

24:12.585 --> 24:14.051
It's far too
dangerous.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.953
What if I promise to ask
for your king's brother

24:15.955 --> 24:17.221
On the way?

24:17.223 --> 24:18.522
Will that satisfy you?

24:20.859 --> 24:23.461
What did the doctors say?

24:23.463 --> 24:25.563
Mary:
The next few hours are critical.

24:25.565 --> 24:29.033
The bleeding from his ear
has slowed, but... They fear

24:29.035 --> 24:31.469
The fever alone
might take him, and soon.

24:31.471 --> 24:33.137
This may seem like an odd
question, but when did

24:33.139 --> 24:34.872
This happen to him?
Is it in the last day?

24:34.874 --> 24:36.874
Yes.

24:36.876 --> 24:39.844
Why? Does that
mean something?

24:39.846 --> 24:42.713
Just wondering.

24:42.715 --> 24:44.748
Keep praying for him, mary.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.718
I just wish
I knew it helped.

24:47.720 --> 24:50.087
You never know what might help.

24:51.723 --> 24:54.091
We have to try everything,
don't we?

24:56.728 --> 24:58.662
â™ª

25:01.900 --> 25:03.200
Lord honoret!

25:03.202 --> 25:06.737
Is that you hiding
behind a whore?

25:06.739 --> 25:10.140
How lovely to walk in
and find I know so many people.

25:10.142 --> 25:11.642
Count desalle!

25:11.644 --> 25:12.877
Remember me?

25:12.879 --> 25:14.745
We met at your wedding.

25:15.814 --> 25:16.814
Greer.

25:16.816 --> 25:18.582
What is claude doing here?

25:18.584 --> 25:19.884
She's shaming my
very best customers

25:19.886 --> 25:21.151
Out of the party.

25:21.153 --> 25:22.653
Leith:
I'll get her out of here.

25:24.990 --> 25:27.157
Oh.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.626
You're here?

25:28.628 --> 25:29.793
Fancy a turn with me?

25:29.795 --> 25:31.028
A wha...?

25:31.030 --> 25:32.897
A dance, you dirty bird.

25:32.899 --> 25:37.034
â™ª as you walk toward the door

25:37.036 --> 25:40.671
â™ª well, I know you've danced
a hundred songs â™ª

25:40.673 --> 25:44.141
â™ª but stay with me one more

25:46.611 --> 25:49.313
â™ª didn't know
how I could tell you â™ª

25:50.782 --> 25:52.783
â™ª but you can already tell

25:52.785 --> 25:55.719
â™ª I don't need anybody

25:55.721 --> 25:57.655
â™ª I'm fine here
on my own, but... â™ª

25:57.657 --> 25:59.590
Hands off, I'm a princess.

25:59.592 --> 26:01.559
Well, a princess has no business
in a house of ill repute.

26:01.561 --> 26:03.694
You're such a prude.

26:03.696 --> 26:05.663
Woman: Nice to see
you again, leith.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.832
Looking fine,
soldier boy.

26:10.302 --> 26:12.202
Oh, they know you.

26:12.204 --> 26:14.171
Maybe you're not
such a prude after all.

26:16.775 --> 26:19.910
The doctor said it may be
any hour now.

26:22.714 --> 26:24.715
My son is dying.

26:24.717 --> 26:27.985
Catherine,
I'm so sorry.

26:27.987 --> 26:29.587
I meant what I said last night.

26:29.589 --> 26:31.055
You don't have to be
alone in this.

26:31.057 --> 26:32.656
You have my loyalty.

26:32.658 --> 26:34.258
And my protection.

26:34.260 --> 26:35.593
Protection?

26:35.595 --> 26:37.127
Mary has ordered

26:37.129 --> 26:40.064
That I deliver
a private army to her.

26:40.066 --> 26:41.966
A general named renaude--
he's a friend of mine.

26:41.968 --> 26:42.967
I've summoned him.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.735
Why are you telling me this?

26:44.737 --> 26:46.837
Last night, you told me
that you were afraid

26:46.839 --> 26:50.007
Of what would happen to you
if francis dies.

26:50.009 --> 26:52.743
Of your enemies
descending

26:52.745 --> 26:54.144
Upon you
and your young children.

26:54.146 --> 26:55.613
I can't think
about this now.

26:55.615 --> 26:58.983
Well, you need to,
because you were right.

26:58.985 --> 27:02.753
If you become regent, your
enemies will move against you.

27:02.755 --> 27:04.722
But even if mary takes
renaude's forces

27:04.724 --> 27:05.956
To scotland,

27:05.958 --> 27:07.291
I still have
the french army here.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.127
Most of whom you can trust,
but not all.

27:10.129 --> 27:13.697
When a crown changes heads,
power shifts.

27:13.699 --> 27:16.700
Nothing is certain,
and no one is safe.

27:16.702 --> 27:20.771
You and your sons
will need extra protection.

27:23.775 --> 27:27.244
Renaude's army should be
for you, catherine,

27:27.246 --> 27:29.780
Not mary.

27:29.782 --> 27:32.116
Why are you so keen
to protect me?

27:32.118 --> 27:33.851
This is just a bet

27:33.853 --> 27:36.387
To see which queen
you think will win.

27:36.389 --> 27:38.255
I'm flattered as
a queen, of course...

27:38.257 --> 27:40.391
Catherine...

27:40.393 --> 27:42.760
I care about you.

27:42.762 --> 27:46.997
If you deny her renaude's army,
mary will destroy you.

27:46.999 --> 27:49.933
And still may resort
to french troops.

27:49.935 --> 27:53.203
It may not come to that
if we can stall.

27:53.205 --> 27:54.405
We may only need hours,

27:54.407 --> 27:55.873
As you say.

27:55.875 --> 27:59.743
If francis dies,
then mary loses her power.

27:59.745 --> 28:01.879
But if the king survives,

28:01.881 --> 28:04.014
Then he'll put a stop
to her plans by himself.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.417
Arrange to stall her, then.

28:09.888 --> 28:11.822
This could cost mary her nation.

28:11.824 --> 28:13.691
Well, she shouldn't
have forgotten

28:13.693 --> 28:17.695
That by marrying your son,
her nation became France.

28:28.473 --> 28:29.773
You're a skilled rider,
lady kenna.

28:29.775 --> 28:31.008
Never discount a woman's skills.

28:31.010 --> 28:33.811
Our daily lives
consist of making

28:33.813 --> 28:34.945
Hardship seem effortless.

28:34.947 --> 28:36.480
I have a feeling I've just begun

28:36.482 --> 28:38.282
To learn the extent
of your skills.

28:38.284 --> 28:39.950
You know, I don't
even know your name.

28:39.952 --> 28:41.151
Man:
General renaude.

28:41.153 --> 28:43.187
I have an urgent message
from court.

28:43.189 --> 28:46.123
General, is it?

28:46.125 --> 28:48.425
Lady kenna, your husband
has returned safely

28:48.427 --> 28:49.426
From his journey.

28:49.428 --> 28:51.295
You're married?

28:51.297 --> 28:53.297
I didn't know.

28:53.299 --> 28:56.467
Please bring lady kenna the rest
of the way to the castle.

28:56.469 --> 28:57.868
I thought you said
that these woods

28:57.870 --> 28:59.403
Were too dangerous for me alone.

28:59.405 --> 29:00.904
And now you're sending me off
with a messenger?

29:00.906 --> 29:03.207
He made it here safely.

29:03.209 --> 29:05.275
The woods between here and
the castle are well-patrolled.

29:05.277 --> 29:06.777
As it happens,
I have other reasons

29:06.779 --> 29:08.312
For not riding on with you.

29:08.314 --> 29:10.414
I'm not headed
where you are anymore.

29:10.416 --> 29:13.150
Oh. I suppose that is
somewhat honorable.

29:13.152 --> 29:17.387
Unless of course I am savagely
murdered here in these woods.

29:17.389 --> 29:19.890
Enjoy your reunion
with your husband.

29:19.892 --> 29:21.492
I'm sure he will.

29:24.295 --> 29:26.797
Clarissa: Is this
wine from the castle?

29:26.799 --> 29:28.799
It's to relax you.

29:28.801 --> 29:32.402
And to thank delphine for
sharing her comforts with us.

29:32.404 --> 29:34.171
Very kind.

29:34.173 --> 29:36.774
It's been so long
since anyone's

29:36.776 --> 29:38.976
Offered me more
than brown water.

29:49.554 --> 29:50.554
(grunting)

29:50.556 --> 29:53.190
Bash, what have you done?

29:53.192 --> 29:55.092
What's-what's happening to me?

29:55.094 --> 29:58.095
Clarissa,
I'm so sorry.

29:58.097 --> 29:59.797
(grunting)

29:59.799 --> 30:02.900
I didn't know
bash had left the castle.

30:02.902 --> 30:05.335
If I had, I never would have
sent you to find him.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.237
But I'm glad you're both safe.

30:08.439 --> 30:10.974
Any word on renaude?

30:10.976 --> 30:12.476
He sent you this message.

30:12.478 --> 30:14.077
He's saying he's two days away.

30:14.079 --> 30:15.479
Two days?

30:15.481 --> 30:17.214
Weren't we told he was closer?

30:17.216 --> 30:19.850
Wait a minute. Mary, renaude
is the man who helped me.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.051
He escorted me
back to the castle.

30:21.053 --> 30:22.820
General renaude is here?

30:22.822 --> 30:24.822
Well, not here. But he said
he was summoned to court,

30:24.824 --> 30:26.089
And then he received a message,

30:26.091 --> 30:28.225
Read it and
turned back around.

30:28.227 --> 30:30.227
Which means
someone told him to lie.

30:30.229 --> 30:33.096
To pretend he was
farther away than he is.
By two days.

30:33.098 --> 30:36.099
Enough time to see whether
the king will live or die.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.534
If he dies,

30:37.536 --> 30:39.236
Catherine will
take power,

30:39.238 --> 30:40.237
She'll stop us.

30:40.239 --> 30:41.371
If he lives,

30:41.373 --> 30:43.106
Francis will most likely
do the same.

30:43.108 --> 30:45.943
This is narcisse's doing.

30:45.945 --> 30:47.377
Tell the guards
to fetch narcisse

30:47.379 --> 30:49.479
And drag him to the dungeons.

30:49.481 --> 30:51.849
I will tear him
in half for this.

30:51.851 --> 30:53.550
Why? Did catherine
make you to do this?

30:53.552 --> 30:55.252
Bash: I'm so sorry.
I'm her child!

30:55.254 --> 30:56.854
I'm doing this
for her other child,

30:56.856 --> 30:59.122
Your brother,
the king.

30:59.124 --> 31:00.424
He's gravely ill.

31:00.426 --> 31:02.993
I... I don't understand.

31:02.995 --> 31:05.896
Your friend, nostradamus,
had a vision.

31:05.898 --> 31:07.297
Mary's return to court

31:07.299 --> 31:09.499
Would cost catherine
her firstborn.

31:09.501 --> 31:12.102
We all thought
that meant francis,

31:12.104 --> 31:14.104
But you were her firstborn.

31:14.106 --> 31:16.440
To those who of us
who believe in such magic,

31:16.442 --> 31:18.275
Your death satisfied the fates.

31:18.277 --> 31:20.310
Do you believe
in such magic?

31:20.312 --> 31:21.478
Bash:
Yes.

31:21.480 --> 31:22.880
Clarissa:
So do I.

31:22.882 --> 31:24.948
If not, the devil
take my soul.

31:29.320 --> 31:31.355
(exhales softly)

31:34.959 --> 31:38.362
You saved her from so much
suffering in her future.

31:46.304 --> 31:49.973
(door opens, closes)

31:51.442 --> 31:55.045
Francis, I am sending
french forces to scotland.

31:56.447 --> 31:58.515
I'm sorry, but
it's the only way.

32:02.587 --> 32:04.655
I know you can't
hear me,

32:04.657 --> 32:08.458
But I wish, if you could,
that you would understand.

32:08.460 --> 32:11.395
I hope that you would
forgive me my choice.

32:11.397 --> 32:15.265
I have forgiven you for yours.

32:15.267 --> 32:18.201
I know that you never meant
for any harm to come to me.

32:24.175 --> 32:27.177
I remember when I couldn't
be this close to you

32:27.179 --> 32:29.947
Or even hear the sound
of your breath.

32:32.617 --> 32:34.618
I cling to that sound now.

32:34.620 --> 32:37.254
I don't want it to end.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.159
(sobbing softly)

32:47.065 --> 32:48.565
(sighs weakly)

32:48.567 --> 32:49.700
Francis?

32:52.704 --> 32:53.971
Catherine!

32:59.010 --> 33:00.510
He's regained
consciousness.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.580
Apparently, he's upright,
and he's even speaking.

33:03.582 --> 33:04.715
Oh, thank god.

33:04.717 --> 33:06.583
I'm so relieved.

33:06.585 --> 33:08.452
Mary, what
about scotland?

33:08.454 --> 33:09.753
Will you still be going?

33:09.755 --> 33:11.188
Are you sending men?

33:11.190 --> 33:13.290
That is for francis
to decide.

33:16.728 --> 33:19.463
You should know
that I informed him of your plan

33:19.465 --> 33:21.198
To send his men to your country.

33:21.200 --> 33:23.133
He already knew,
of course,

33:23.135 --> 33:25.435
That you were willing
to betray and abandon him.

33:33.544 --> 33:35.145
Francis, thank god.

33:36.114 --> 33:38.215
The fever's broken.

33:38.217 --> 33:41.485
Doctors say
I'll be on my feet soon.

33:41.487 --> 33:43.620
My mother's told me
about the crisis in scotland.

33:43.622 --> 33:45.622
I need to explain.
No, there's no need.

33:45.624 --> 33:47.257
I've already made my decision.

33:47.259 --> 33:48.759
And it's final.

33:50.695 --> 33:53.797
I have ordered 2,000 french
troops to sail to scotland...

33:53.799 --> 33:55.132
Francis!

33:55.134 --> 33:56.166
...To defend
your supporters.

33:56.168 --> 33:57.434
You can't!
I have faith

33:57.436 --> 33:58.769
That France can withstand

33:58.771 --> 34:00.504
The temporary absence of troops

34:00.506 --> 34:03.040
As well as the cost
in gold to send them.

34:03.042 --> 34:07.677
Let our enemies observe
this display of french power.

34:07.679 --> 34:10.213
Why would you do this
after such a betrayal?

34:10.215 --> 34:11.648
I said my decision was final.

34:12.717 --> 34:14.317
Leave us, mother.

34:20.625 --> 34:24.561
I am grateful...
But I have to ask

34:24.563 --> 34:27.130
The same question. Why?

34:27.132 --> 34:31.101
You mean why, when you were
about to leave France?

34:31.103 --> 34:34.304
To turn your back on the country
that sheltered you as a child

34:34.306 --> 34:36.673
And abandon the crown
you were given?

34:36.675 --> 34:40.577
And me, the husband
you swore an oath to?

34:40.579 --> 34:42.679
Yes.

34:42.681 --> 34:46.316
Because my country
made yours a promise,

34:46.318 --> 34:47.517
That's why.

34:47.519 --> 34:49.419
France and scotland
are allies.

34:49.421 --> 34:52.289
We are both stronger
when we honor our promises.

34:52.291 --> 34:54.391
Unlike your wife, you mean.

34:54.393 --> 34:55.759
Make of that what you will,

34:55.761 --> 34:57.694
But I have been given
a second chance at life,

34:57.696 --> 35:00.430
And I intend
to live it more wisely.

35:00.432 --> 35:03.700
So the next time I'm staring
at death, I can have no regrets.

35:03.702 --> 35:05.669
And do you regret marrying me?

35:10.441 --> 35:13.777
I think you should leave.

35:13.779 --> 35:16.880
Leave this room?

35:16.882 --> 35:18.748
Or leave France?

35:18.750 --> 35:20.817
That's up to you.

35:22.120 --> 35:23.787
You got what you wanted--

35:23.789 --> 35:27.691
Your freedom,
your country's salvation.

35:27.693 --> 35:31.695
Just don't expect
a fond farewell from me.

35:31.697 --> 35:33.697
Or my trust.

35:33.699 --> 35:35.665
Ever again.

35:42.707 --> 35:45.542
(door opens, closes)

35:45.544 --> 35:48.411
Could the driver have taken
a longer way back to the castle?

35:48.413 --> 35:50.280
And was there a single
kingsguard errand

35:50.282 --> 35:51.748
You left unfinished?

35:51.750 --> 35:54.451
You should thank me for
giving you time to sober up.

35:54.453 --> 35:56.820
I wanted my mother
to see me drunk, you idiot.

35:56.822 --> 35:59.189
Claude.
Hello, leith.

35:59.191 --> 36:00.690
Lady kenna.

36:00.692 --> 36:02.359
I was so sorry to hear
about your brother.

36:02.361 --> 36:04.895
But you must be so relieved
now that he's awake.

36:04.897 --> 36:06.763
Awake?
What are you on about?

36:06.765 --> 36:08.465
Well, francis.

36:08.467 --> 36:10.700
He was so ill, and...

36:10.702 --> 36:12.736
You didn't know.

36:12.738 --> 36:14.671
How long was he ill?

36:14.673 --> 36:19.209
He fell unconscious the
night before last, and...

36:19.211 --> 36:22.245
Well, I'm sure someone
was supposed to tell you.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.815
Just not me.

36:25.817 --> 36:28.351
Please save your rage
for after I leave.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.892
You kept me away from the
castle purposely, didn't you?

36:35.894 --> 36:39.896
So I didn't make a family crisis
worse than it already was.

36:39.898 --> 36:41.898
Well, don't be so stoic.

36:41.900 --> 36:43.500
This isn't a
military tribunal.

36:44.936 --> 36:47.470
Why do they treat me
like a child?

36:47.472 --> 36:49.306
Like a problem
that needs to be managed.

36:49.308 --> 36:51.575
You tell me.

36:51.577 --> 36:55.212
I get into trouble.

36:55.214 --> 36:57.347
I go for the wrong men.

36:57.349 --> 36:58.915
I suppose you could argue

36:58.917 --> 37:01.651
That I only want the things
that I can't have.

37:03.454 --> 37:04.854
But I can change.

37:04.856 --> 37:08.258
I mean,
you're a promising fellow.

37:08.260 --> 37:11.394
Except for the bit about
all the whores knowing you.

37:11.396 --> 37:12.929
Uh...

37:12.931 --> 37:16.866
Their madam and I are together.

37:18.669 --> 37:21.271
So much for breaking a pattern.

37:24.242 --> 37:27.944
â™ª one hand on the throne

37:27.946 --> 37:31.948
â™ª and one on your heart...

37:31.950 --> 37:35.285
Bash:
Your majesty.

37:35.287 --> 37:36.686
Brother, I'm fine.

37:36.688 --> 37:40.557
â™ª love is the mercy
covering me... â™ª

37:40.559 --> 37:42.259
It was rather
a miracle.

37:42.261 --> 37:43.660
I was told to
call for charles,

37:43.662 --> 37:45.362
But in the middle
of the night,

37:45.364 --> 37:48.365
Francis's condition
suddenly reversed itself.

37:48.367 --> 37:51.301
Middle of the night,
just like that.

37:52.703 --> 37:54.704
Yes, a miracle.

37:54.706 --> 37:56.706
â™ª so don't...

37:56.708 --> 37:59.276
Yes, I suppose it was.

37:59.278 --> 38:00.644
â™ª don't let me go

38:04.982 --> 38:07.984
â™ª don't...

38:07.986 --> 38:09.853
â™ª don't let me go...

38:09.855 --> 38:11.855
Ships have set sail
for scotland.

38:11.857 --> 38:15.358
Francis's troops.

38:15.360 --> 38:18.361
But we won't be leaving
any time soon, will we?

38:18.363 --> 38:20.063
I can't.

38:20.065 --> 38:22.065
Not now, of course, but...

38:22.067 --> 38:24.501
When francis
has fully recovered?

38:24.503 --> 38:27.337
When I leave, I will weaken him
in the eyes of europe,

38:27.339 --> 38:29.539
Just when he has
weakened himself

38:29.541 --> 38:31.908
By upholding the alliance
between France and scotland.

38:31.910 --> 38:33.410
I don't understand.

38:33.412 --> 38:35.879
How long do you
mean to remain?

38:35.881 --> 38:38.048
Did he make this a
condition of his order,

38:38.050 --> 38:41.051
That you need to
stay here in France?

38:41.053 --> 38:42.986
No, he did not.

38:44.355 --> 38:46.022
Then why are you
doing this, mary?

38:46.024 --> 38:47.957
I love you, and
you love me.

38:47.959 --> 38:49.526
Our love will die here.

38:49.528 --> 38:50.694
You must know that.

38:50.696 --> 38:52.028
Please try to understand.

38:52.030 --> 38:54.497
I'm not my own person
in this.

38:54.499 --> 38:56.366
I'm not just responsible
to you or me.

38:56.368 --> 38:58.034
I am responsible
to two countries.

38:58.036 --> 38:59.836
Do you think I've
forgotten that, mary?

38:59.838 --> 39:03.606
I'm a prince with my own people,
my own responsibilities.

39:05.643 --> 39:09.512
No, I don't suppose
you did forget.

39:09.514 --> 39:11.748
But maybe I did.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.451
My feelings for you
are so strong that...

39:14.453 --> 39:16.753
I couldn't
see past them at times.

39:16.755 --> 39:19.756
And what do you see now?

39:19.758 --> 39:22.025
An affair under your husband's
roof and nothing more?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.060
It's all I can offer you.

39:25.730 --> 39:28.631
I once told you that my heart
was all I had to give.

39:30.000 --> 39:31.668
Is that not enough anymore?

39:31.670 --> 39:34.571
Honestly, I don't know.

39:35.539 --> 39:37.607
â™ª don't let me go

39:40.778 --> 39:44.013
â™ª don't...

39:44.015 --> 39:47.016
â™ª don't let me go...

39:47.018 --> 39:48.551
How is the king?

39:48.553 --> 39:49.619
Resting.

39:50.921 --> 39:52.989
I would like to stay
for a while.

39:53.958 --> 39:57.627
â™ª don't let me go

40:00.765 --> 40:07.003
â™ª run to me in the rising dawn

40:10.508 --> 40:13.510
â™ª forever we'll be holding on.
