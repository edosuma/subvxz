- Look for someone.
Got it.

17:01.076 --> 17:03.510
- Bye.

17:03.512 --> 17:04.544
- Ooh.

17:04.546 --> 17:06.179
- Mom, I'm sorry
I've given you

17:06.181 --> 17:08.181
so much [Bleep]
these past few months.

17:08.183 --> 17:09.950
- Matty, watch your language.

17:09.952 --> 17:13.086
You've put me through
the [Bleep] wringer.

17:13.088 --> 17:13.887
- Mom.

17:13.889 --> 17:14.921
- Don't tell your father.

17:14.923 --> 17:19.526
But after a few Pinot Grigios,
I turn into Chris Rock.

17:19.528 --> 17:22.829
I'm the one
who should be sorry.

17:22.831 --> 17:26.333
I really--I could've handled
things so much better.

17:26.335 --> 17:29.569
I'm not exactly
a perfect mother.

17:29.571 --> 17:33.907
- Well, I'm not exactly
the perfect son.

17:33.909 --> 17:37.277
- Thanks.

17:37.879 --> 17:40.113
- Midnight was approaching,
and no sign of Matty.

17:40.115 --> 17:43.617
He said he wanted to be
together, but where was he?

17:43.619 --> 17:44.251
Hey.

17:44.253 --> 17:45.552
Have you guys seen Matty?

17:45.554 --> 17:46.486
- No.
- I did.

17:46.488 --> 17:48.321
He took off with
some older chick.

17:48.323 --> 17:49.022
- His mom?

17:49.024 --> 17:51.157
- I think his mom's
with your mom.

17:51.159 --> 17:52.192
Hello, hell frozen over.

17:52.194 --> 17:53.460
Anyone have a fire popsicle?

17:53.462 --> 17:54.494
- It was some hot cougar chick

17:54.496 --> 17:57.998
who was totally hammered
and so ready to throw down.

17:58.000 --> 17:59.332
- Pete, focus.

17:59.334 --> 18:01.134
- Not only did Matty
not care about being together

18:01.136 --> 18:03.570
at midnight, but he clearly
wasn't really worried

18:03.572 --> 18:05.171
about our
no-hook-up pact either.

18:05.173 --> 18:07.874
All I knew was I didn't want
to start a new year

18:07.876 --> 18:09.242
feeling rejected by him.

18:09.244 --> 18:10.143
Been there, done that.

18:10.145 --> 18:15.015
And the new year is supposed
to be...New.

18:15.017 --> 18:17.517
- [Plays piano]

18:17.519 --> 18:19.185
[Music stops]

18:19.187 --> 18:23.023
- Do you take requests?

18:24.258 --> 18:27.127
- Have you guys seen Jenna?

18:27.129 --> 18:27.961
- Mm.

18:27.963 --> 18:29.663
- Ten seconds to midnight!

18:29.665 --> 18:34.634
All: Ten, nine,
eight, seven, six,

18:34.636 --> 18:38.038
five, four, three,

18:38.040 --> 18:39.306
two, one!

18:39.308 --> 18:40.140
Happy new year!

19:22.216 --> 19:24.250
Matty and I had both failed
at our no-hook-up pact,

19:24.252 --> 19:25.452
but not at renewing
our friendship.

19:25.454 --> 19:29.422
Owen and I hadn't exchanged
numbers or even last names.

19:29.424 --> 19:31.391
He was
the perfect midnight kiss--

19:31.393 --> 19:32.325
no complications.

19:32.327 --> 19:33.593
And we only went
to second base,

19:33.595 --> 19:35.195
so as far
as I was concerned,

19:35.197 --> 19:36.563
I had a very clean slate.

19:36.565 --> 19:38.164
Oh, look
who came up for air.

19:38.166 --> 19:41.067
- My face is actually sore
from making out with Pete.

19:41.069 --> 19:42.569
He is crossed off
my "[Bleep] it" list.

19:42.571 --> 19:45.338
- Gross. I'm glad my
midnight kiss wasn't like that.

19:45.340 --> 19:47.507
- You broke
the no-hook-up pact?

19:47.509 --> 19:49.943
- Well, if you call kissing
my mom on the cheek

19:49.945 --> 19:50.577
breaking the pact.

19:50.579 --> 19:52.245
Which I wouldn't,
because it's gross.

19:52.247 --> 19:55.048
- Yeah, I wouldn't want
to be kissing any old moms.

19:55.050 --> 19:57.317
- Wait, your mom?
- Yeah, I talked to her.

19:57.319 --> 19:59.119
It was really good.
- Good.

19:59.121 --> 20:00.353
- Where were you
at midnight, Jenna?

20:00.355 --> 20:03.089
- Yeah, I was looking for you.

20:03.091 --> 20:05.358
- Uh...

20:06.027 --> 20:08.862
Does that guy go
to our school?

20:08.864 --> 20:09.396
- Owen?

20:09.398 --> 20:10.263
Sophomore in orchestra.

20:10.265 --> 20:12.499
Who cares?
Where were you at midnight?

20:12.501 --> 20:14.167
[Gasps] Oh, my God,
did you break the pact?

20:14.169 --> 20:17.037
- My clean slate had suddenly
become a bit dirty.

20:17.039 --> 20:19.406
Not only did I break
the no-hook-up pact,

20:19.408 --> 20:21.041
but I did it with
a sophomore.

20:21.043 --> 20:23.643
No, I was
with my mom also.

20:23.645 --> 20:25.211
- [Laughs]
- Outside.

20:25.213 --> 20:26.312
She was puking.
- Mm.

20:26.314 --> 20:29.015
Wow.
Looks like we did it.

20:29.017 --> 20:31.284
Although you owe me
a midnight kiss.

20:31.286 --> 20:35.155
- Make that a very dirty slate.

20:37.992 --> 20:39.125
- Next on <i>Awkward...</i>
- Jenna!

20:39.127 --> 20:40.493
You had no idea I went here,
did you?

20:40.495 --> 20:41.494
- What are you doing here?

20:41.496 --> 20:43.063
- We are helping out
at the career fair.

20:43.065 --> 20:44.564
- There's something
I've got to tell you.

20:44.566 --> 20:46.232
- For the love of Christ,
just say it, darling.

20:46.234 --> 20:47.567
- This is a lot harder
than I thought.

20:47.569 --> 20:48.468
- Today was the day that

20:48.470 --> 20:50.370
SCU sent out
their admissions decissions.

20:50.372 --> 20:52.505
Any minute now,
I'd receive an email

20:52.507 --> 20:54.507
that could change
my life forever.

20:54.509 --> 20:57.310
- I'm in! Jenna?
- Um...
