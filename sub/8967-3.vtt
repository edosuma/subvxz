This is the
Evergreen Forest.

00:03.436 --> 00:04.170
Quiet, peaceful, serene.

00:07.774 --> 00:10.210
That is, until
Bert Raccoon wakes up.

00:10.210 --> 00:11.878
Bert Raccoon: Yahoooo!

Yeeeehaaaa!

Yikes!

Yaaaah...

00:21.988 --> 00:23.490
Yeaaaah!

00:23.490 --> 00:26.459
Luckily, he has some
good friends to help him out.

00:33.967 --> 00:36.269
Life would be simple
in the forest except for...

00:37.837 --> 00:39.372
Cyril Sneer!

00:42.709 --> 00:44.911
And his life would be simple
except for...

the Raccoons!!

01:01.628 --> 01:05.031
It's a beautiful sunny day in

01:05.031 --> 01:07.267
And everyone is enjoying baseball,

01:07.267 --> 01:09.469
skateboarding and barbecues.

01:09.469 --> 01:12.005
Everyone that is

01:12.005 --> 01:13.740
who has the unfortunate job

01:13.740 --> 01:16.409
of delivering the
Evergreen Standard.

01:16.409 --> 01:19.412
Ah! Oh boy, Broo.

01:19.412 --> 01:23.183
Ever since that subscription
drive doubled circulation,

01:23.183 --> 01:26.686
it takes us twice as long to
finish this paper route.

01:26.686 --> 01:28.988
Woof-woof!
We've got more customers,

01:28.988 --> 01:31.925
than Cyril Sneer's
got bank accounts!

01:31.925 --> 01:34.894
And my bike wasn't built
for this kind of work.

01:34.894 --> 01:37.230
It can barely hold
the two of us.

01:37.230 --> 01:38.331
Woof-woof!

01:38.331 --> 01:41.101
And with customers
like old hose nose,

01:41.101 --> 01:43.970
it hardly makes
the work worth it.

01:43.970 --> 01:46.773
Hey Broo, what's the difference

01:46.773 --> 01:49.709
between Cyril Sneer and a canoe?

02:03.223 --> 02:04.491
More bills?

The Pig: There's some
pretty exciting stuff, Sir.

All you have to do is
buy three records a week

02:10.263 --> 02:11.764

Finally,
something of substance.

Let's hope it's a check!

Thank goodness we're
almost finished, Broo.

serious work of demolishing

Wow! Hey look, Broo!

03:32.979 --> 03:34.681
Look at that!

This is incredible!

I knew that we were
meant for each other.

Why, I'll be able to
fly all over the forest,

03:57.203 --> 03:59.639
dropping newspapers everywhere.

03:59.639 --> 04:02.742
Well... it does
need a lot of work, Bert.

04:02.742 --> 04:04.744
The tail rotor looks unstable.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.246
The ball joints look loose

04:06.246 --> 04:09.249
and the motor needs
a total overhaul.

04:09.249 --> 04:12.385
But we should have it
flying in no time.

04:12.385 --> 04:13.820
Yaaaahooo!

04:13.820 --> 04:15.622
Look! Up in the sky!

Hi guys,
what's going on?

04:21.060 --> 04:23.229
We can hear you clear back
to the raccoon-dominium.

04:23.229 --> 04:25.198
Wow, what's this?

04:25.198 --> 04:30.236
This is the latest in
newspaper delivery technology.

04:30.236 --> 04:33.606
Just liberated
from our local junkyard.

04:33.606 --> 04:38.444
Why, it's, it's
a 1947 Whirlyboy Stubbs.

04:38.444 --> 04:41.114
This is a classic
in aviation history.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.282
It is?!

04:42.282 --> 04:44.617
Where did you
learn about flying, Ralph?

04:44.617 --> 04:46.185
Are you kidding?!

04:46.185 --> 04:50.056
My family was there the day the
Wright brothers made history.

04:50.056 --> 04:53.559
Flying has got to be the
greatest thing in the world!

04:53.559 --> 04:55.561
Well, as soon as
Cedric and I have

04:55.561 --> 04:57.764
whipped this baby into shape,

04:57.764 --> 05:00.433
I'll take
everybody for a test spin

05:00.433 --> 05:03.136
into the wild blue yonder.

05:03.136 --> 05:06.406
I can hardly wait!
How about you, Melissa?

05:07.473 --> 05:09.075
Sure, Ralph,

05:09.075 --> 05:11.210
it should be some kind of fun.

05:12.445 --> 05:13.579
Auuu!

05:13.579 --> 05:15.782
The Pig 1:
Did gold prices crash?

05:15.782 --> 05:17.650
Worse, worse!

05:17.650 --> 05:19.752
Far more disastrous!!

05:19.752 --> 05:21.721
The Pig 2: A chain letter?
No!

05:21.721 --> 05:24.957
The Pig 2: Gee, what could be
worse than a chain letter?

05:24.957 --> 05:27.126
Getting a
letter from Karl Snarl!

05:27.126 --> 05:29.162
The Pigs: Karl Snarl?!

05:29.162 --> 05:30.730
The Pig 2: Who's Karl Snarl?

05:30.730 --> 05:32.765
A man with no scruples!

05:32.765 --> 05:35.134
Greedy, backbiting, unsympathetic,

05:35.134 --> 05:37.437
lecherous and a lout.

05:37.437 --> 05:39.472
He seemed to be
the perfect partner.

05:39.472 --> 05:41.741
The Pig 1:
You had a partner, Sir?!

05:41.741 --> 05:45.345
40 years ago,
we had a small business then.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.946
It was going bankrupt.

05:46.946 --> 05:48.481
No orders were coming in.

05:48.481 --> 05:51.684
It was failing, and you know
how much I hate failure.

05:51.684 --> 05:53.052
So I.. I, I...

05:53.052 --> 05:55.254
The Pig 3: Oh,
what did you do, Sir?

05:55.254 --> 05:57.757
I did the
only honorable thing!

05:57.757 --> 06:01.494
I skipped town and left Snarl
holding the bag.

06:01.494 --> 06:04.130
And now after 40 years,
he's found me.

06:04.130 --> 06:08.201
The Pig 1: (reading) I'm coming
to give you what you deserve.

06:08.201 --> 06:11.471
He's coming to get his
revenge, and ruin my empire.

06:11.471 --> 06:14.040
The Pig 2: What could
he possibly do, Sir?

06:14.040 --> 06:17.944
Do?! Why, he could
strike at my cash reserves,

06:17.944 --> 06:20.179
or separate me from my gold.

06:20.179 --> 06:22.949
No, he'll be far more
devious than that.

06:22.949 --> 06:24.884
He'll undermine my stocks,

06:24.884 --> 06:27.720
block my deals,
garnishee my wages.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.123
There's no telling
where he'll strike first!

06:30.123 --> 06:31.891
Remember the old saying boys?

06:31.891 --> 06:33.693
'You should always
look both ways,

06:33.693 --> 06:35.528
before crossing your partner.'

06:35.528 --> 06:37.563
Oh, woe is me!

06:39.298 --> 06:42.235
This trunk belonged
to my uncle Rocky.

06:42.235 --> 06:44.971
Who is he?
He was a bush pilot,

06:44.971 --> 06:48.374
one of the greatest to ever slip
into the cockpit of a plane.

06:48.374 --> 06:50.543
This scarf, in fact,
belonged to him.

06:50.543 --> 06:53.579
He wore it on every single
mission he ever flew.

06:53.579 --> 06:54.781
He gave it to me, hoping

06:54.781 --> 06:57.250
that I would carry on
the family tradition.

06:57.250 --> 07:00.353
Well, I'll never fly.
What?!

07:00.353 --> 07:02.355
You know me
Ralph, I get dizzy

07:02.355 --> 07:04.557
looking out the upstairs window.

07:04.557 --> 07:08.094
But honey, once you get
in and see how easy it is,

07:08.094 --> 07:10.229
there'll be no holding you back.

07:10.229 --> 07:13.933
All you have to do is
confront your fears head on!

07:13.933 --> 07:16.936
Gee, I wish I shared
your confidence, Ralph,

07:16.936 --> 07:20.406
but I don't think I'll ever
set foot in that helicopter.

07:21.274 --> 07:23.176
So you see, Melissa,

07:23.176 --> 07:25.678
it's no more
complicated than that.

07:25.678 --> 07:27.780
It's quite easy, right Ralph?

07:27.780 --> 07:30.850
Relax Melissa,
there's nothing to it!

07:30.850 --> 07:32.952
That's
easy for you to say, but

07:32.952 --> 07:36.155
I'd rather keep my feet
on the ground, thank you.

07:36.155 --> 07:39.892
Ah! That just
about does it, gang.

07:39.892 --> 07:41.461
First thing tomorrow morning,

07:41.461 --> 07:44.197
we can have our very
first test flight.

07:44.197 --> 07:46.432
Yahooo!

07:48.501 --> 07:50.970
Please, please!! No!

07:50.970 --> 07:53.272
No, stop! Not that!

07:53.272 --> 07:56.742
Stop Karl! Stop! My gold bars!

07:56.742 --> 08:00.246
(in dream) I'm coming to
give you what you deserve!

08:00.913 --> 08:03.049
What you deserve!

08:03.049 --> 08:06.419
Deserve!!

08:06.419 --> 08:07.920
No!!!

08:08.955 --> 08:12.124
No!! Stop!
Pop, Pop, are you okay?

08:12.124 --> 08:14.494
Can you hear me, Pop?
Wha- wha-where am I?

08:14.494 --> 08:16.562
Cedric? What are you doing here?

08:16.562 --> 08:19.398
I heard
those terrible screams!

08:19.398 --> 08:21.701
Did gold prices
crash, Pop?

08:21.701 --> 08:25.338
Oh Cedric,
I'm so glad it's you.

08:25.338 --> 08:29.041
I can't begin to tell you
the.. nightmare I've had!

08:29.041 --> 08:30.476
Nightmare, Pop?!

08:30.476 --> 08:32.478
You see Cedric,
many years ago

08:32.478 --> 08:35.781
I had a, a partner,
Karl Snarl.

08:35.781 --> 08:39.118
We had a small business
together 'Sneer and Snarl',

08:39.118 --> 08:40.353
Catchy, Pop.

08:40.353 --> 08:44.023
Well, for various reasons
I had to leave the company.

08:44.023 --> 08:46.125
That was 40 years ago.

08:46.125 --> 08:49.662
Then yesterday,
I received this letter.

08:49.662 --> 08:53.299
Really Pop!
Keeping it under your
pillow!

08:53.299 --> 08:54.667
Hmmm...

08:54.667 --> 08:57.837
You're going
to get what you deserve.

08:57.837 --> 09:01.107
Snarl's never forgiven
me for leaving, Cedric.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.376
I know it. He's on my trail!

09:03.376 --> 09:06.178
He's got my number,
he's out for my hide.

09:06.178 --> 09:10.116
You've been working very
hard lately, haven't you Pop?

09:10.116 --> 09:12.251
That Snarl's
a monster, Cedric!

09:12.251 --> 09:15.955
The kind that doesn't rest
until the debt is collected!

09:15.955 --> 09:17.657
Try to get
some rest, Pop.

09:17.657 --> 09:19.292
You'll feel better
in the morning.

09:23.396 --> 09:26.866
Isn't she something, gang?

09:26.866 --> 09:29.835
How'd you like to take
the very first ride, Schaeffer?

09:29.835 --> 09:31.804
Thanks for the offer,

09:31.804 --> 09:34.073
but I'm just a little
too big to fit.

09:34.073 --> 09:36.842
Well, um...
how about you then Cedric?

09:36.842 --> 09:39.178
Well.. okay, Bert...

09:39.178 --> 09:41.747
All right! Ha-haa!

09:41.747 --> 09:44.617
Time to take to the sky!

09:44.617 --> 09:46.319
Not until you learn

09:46.319 --> 09:49.121
how to run the chopper
properly, Bert.

09:49.121 --> 09:51.290
Now pay attention, everybody.

09:51.290 --> 09:53.593
This lever is for up and down,

09:53.593 --> 09:56.495
this lever is for
backward and forward.

09:56.495 --> 09:58.064
That
seems easy enough.

09:58.064 --> 10:00.766
It's a breeze. Uncle
Rocky could have flown this

10:00.766 --> 10:02.335
with his eyes closed.

10:02.335 --> 10:06.505
Okay Bert, the first
test flight is about to begin.

10:06.505 --> 10:09.375

Are you certain all

11:17.076 --> 11:19.512
security precautions
have been taken?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.247
The Pig 1:
No need to worry, Sir.

11:21.247 --> 11:25.351
This place is sealed tighter
than leftovers in Tupperware.

11:25.351 --> 11:28.054
The Pig 2: Yes Sir,
even tighter than your wallet.

11:28.054 --> 11:29.155
All right then!

11:29.155 --> 11:32.358
To your post and keep
your eyes peeled!

11:32.958 --> 11:35.327
Yahoooo! Ha-haaa!

11:35.327 --> 11:37.997
Isn't this the greatest, Cedric?

11:37.997 --> 11:41.133
Cedric? Cedric? Are you OK?

11:41.133 --> 11:42.468
Lookout, Bert!

11:48.207 --> 11:51.143
So I'll sell
4,800 shares of...

11:51.143 --> 11:53.612
What the... auaaaa!

11:56.015 --> 11:58.150
Get to the roof, immediately!

11:58.150 --> 12:00.152
Do you hear me?
The Pig: Yes, Sir!

12:00.152 --> 12:02.455
There's something
funny going on.

12:02.455 --> 12:04.457
The Pig 2: It's your
satellite dish, Sir.

12:04.457 --> 12:05.791
It's been hit!
Hit?!

12:05.791 --> 12:08.861
The Pig 1: By a helicopter!
A helicopter?!

12:08.861 --> 12:11.731
Snarl, that crafty devil!!

12:11.731 --> 12:14.400
He's seen right through
our security devices.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.001
He's attacking by air!

12:16.001 --> 12:19.438
I want anti-chopper devices
set-up immediately!

12:19.438 --> 12:21.006
The Pigs: Y-yes, Sir.

12:21.006 --> 12:23.175
Next time,
that snake Snarl

12:23.175 --> 12:25.244
can blow us to smithereens!

12:25.244 --> 12:27.446
We have to be ready
for him, understand?

12:27.446 --> 12:29.181
We're under siege!

12:29.181 --> 12:30.716
The Pig: We're underpaid!

12:33.085 --> 12:36.122
Let her down easy,
- Bert!
- Uaaaah!

12:36.122 --> 12:37.423
Ua-aaah-ah!

12:40.926 --> 12:42.094
How did it go, guys?

12:42.094 --> 12:43.696
Was she easy to handle?

12:43.696 --> 12:44.730
Woof-woof!

12:44.730 --> 12:45.931
Ooohh!

12:52.071 --> 12:53.672
The Pig: Sir! Sir!

12:53.672 --> 12:55.374
What is it? What is it?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.943
The Pig 2: It's a telegram, Sir.

13:02.114 --> 13:05.518
(reading) On my way,
be there in a matter of hours.

13:05.518 --> 13:08.888
Ohh, Snarl, you sly fox!

13:08.888 --> 13:10.856
This is a ruse.

13:10.856 --> 13:14.593
The Pig 2: He sent you
a ruse, sir? How romantic!

13:14.593 --> 13:16.896
Sounds like he wants to make up.

13:16.896 --> 13:20.199
Ruse, air head!
R-U, as in,

13:20.199 --> 13:22.601
are you really that stupid?

13:22.601 --> 13:25.237
It's a red herring,
a false clue, a trick!

13:25.237 --> 13:27.139
To make me believe that
he isn't already

13:27.139 --> 13:28.641
right here in the forest.

13:28.641 --> 13:30.776
Increase surveillance!

13:30.776 --> 13:33.913
I want you to throw a security
net over this place

13:33.913 --> 13:35.781
a guppy couldn't get through!

13:37.616 --> 13:41.387
My life is in serious danger!

13:43.589 --> 13:44.256
Gee Bert, the collision with

13:44.256 --> 13:46.325
Gee Bert, the collision
with the satellite dish

13:46.458 --> 13:46.959
pretty well destroyed the

13:46.959 --> 13:48.961
pretty well destroyed
the stabilizer.

13:48.961 --> 13:52.731
It's such a tiny part.
Who needs it?

13:52.731 --> 13:55.301
Without it, this
helicopter would fly around

13:55.301 --> 13:57.736
like a frog in a windstorm.

13:57.736 --> 14:00.306
Anyway, I've got a
replacement at the house.

14:00.306 --> 14:02.141
We'll be back in awhile!

14:02.141 --> 14:06.011
Oh, don't try to operate the
chopper. It needs a part.

14:06.011 --> 14:09.081
Just when I wanted
to take this baby up.

14:09.081 --> 14:12.284
Oh well, Melissa, I'll
show you how this works.

14:12.284 --> 14:15.654
The gyro here indicates the
pitch of the blade,

14:15.654 --> 14:18.090
which in turn controls
your rotor speed.

14:18.090 --> 14:21.126
But Cedric says that
controls the rotor pitch.

14:21.126 --> 14:22.761
Oh...

14:22.761 --> 14:25.865
Boy, this is fantastic.

14:25.865 --> 14:26.999
Aren't you gonna get in?

14:30.336 --> 14:32.838
The Pig 1: I've never
seen the boss like this.

14:32.838 --> 14:36.442
The Pig 2: This Snarl
must be one mean dude.

14:36.442 --> 14:39.478
The Pig 3: Shhh!
Here comes the boss now.

14:43.015 --> 14:44.683
The Pig 1: Another hanky, Sir?

14:44.683 --> 14:46.385
Hang the hanky ham head!

14:46.385 --> 14:48.621
What about my security systems?

14:48.621 --> 14:51.357
The Pig 3: Everything
is booby trapped, Sir!

14:51.357 --> 14:53.459
The Pig 2: Why, a mouse
couldn't get in here?

14:53.459 --> 14:54.994
Who cares about a mouse?

14:54.994 --> 14:57.196
Can it keep out that 7-foot rat?

14:57.196 --> 14:59.665
Yeaaaah. Ah-oh!

14:59.665 --> 15:03.068
It's, it's just a shadow.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.804
The Pigs:

15:05.804 --> 15:08.574
It's locked. I guess
Dad must have stepped out,

15:08.574 --> 15:11.076
but there's always
a key under the doormat.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.344
What's this?!

15:12.344 --> 15:14.747
Beat it,
scram, get lost.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.248
No one lives here.

15:19.051 --> 15:20.519
The Pig 1: I'll get it.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.688
Ow!!

15:22.688 --> 15:24.723
You absent minded swine!

15:24.723 --> 15:27.426
Don't you realize, that
it's Snarl out there.

15:27.426 --> 15:30.029
It's okay,
I know another way in.

15:31.897 --> 15:34.667
I used to use this route
when I was younger.

15:38.103 --> 15:41.740
Um, ah.. a-are
you sure this is safe?

15:41.740 --> 15:45.010
Sure, I've come up
this way a thousand times.

15:48.514 --> 15:50.783
I always leave my
bedroom window open.

15:58.223 --> 15:59.525
Ugh?!

15:59.525 --> 16:02.261
I don't
remember this being here.

16:03.595 --> 16:06.398
Cedric/Bert: Uaaaah!

16:07.232 --> 16:10.069
Broo, go fetch
Melissa and Ralph!

16:10.069 --> 16:11.403
And bring some rope!

16:11.403 --> 16:12.905
Rope's nothing!

16:12.905 --> 16:16.709
Bring the whole fire
department, and hurry up!

16:16.709 --> 16:18.978
This ledge is shrinking fast!

16:18.978 --> 16:21.613
♪ (dramatic music) ♪

16:23.148 --> 16:24.416
What's
wrong, little fellah?

16:25.751 --> 16:27.953
What??
Cedric and Bert?

16:27.953 --> 16:30.622
We'll have to use the
helicopter to save them.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.791
Ralph, you can fly this thing!

16:32.791 --> 16:36.161
I.. uh,
I'm.. uh.. rusty.

16:36.161 --> 16:38.330
Nonsense!
You're a pro!

16:38.330 --> 16:41.266
Actually,
I never really.. I ne...

16:41.266 --> 16:44.069
had formal training.

16:44.069 --> 16:45.637
What?!
Ralph,

16:45.637 --> 16:47.940
you're not afraid
of flying, are you?

16:47.940 --> 16:49.942
I.. I.. um...

16:49.942 --> 16:52.845
You are
afraid of flying!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.313
Aaaaah!

16:54.313 --> 16:55.647
Can you do it?

16:55.647 --> 16:57.349
I guess
I'll have to do it.

16:57.950 --> 16:59.518
Come on, Broo!

17:00.152 --> 17:02.588
Now, what did Cedric say?

17:03.022 --> 17:05.624
Which lever operates
the going up part?

17:12.765 --> 17:14.600
Uhg?
Good luck Melissa!

17:14.600 --> 17:15.801
Oooh!

17:19.471 --> 17:21.974
The Pig 1:
Intruders, Sir!
Intruders!!

17:21.974 --> 17:24.476
Brilliant deduction,
Swine-stein!

17:24.476 --> 17:27.546
It's Snarl and one of his
henchman trying to bust in!

17:27.546 --> 17:29.281
Where's that security?

17:29.281 --> 17:30.783
The Pig 1: Calm down, Sir!

17:30.783 --> 17:33.318
The ledge is receding,
just like in the manual

17:33.318 --> 17:35.220
just a few more minutes, Sir.

17:35.220 --> 17:37.556
And...

17:37.556 --> 17:39.391
Ha-haa!

17:39.391 --> 17:41.460
Now, what
does this leaver do?

17:41.460 --> 17:44.863
Uuuuu-aaaah!

17:46.298 --> 17:47.933
Sorry about that, Broo.

17:47.933 --> 17:51.036
Uuuuh! Aaaah! Help!!
I'm slipping!!

17:51.036 --> 17:53.372
Do you hear
something Cedric?

17:53.372 --> 17:56.341
Look! It's Ralph, we're
saved!

17:56.341 --> 17:57.810
Maybe not.

17:57.810 --> 17:59.845
There's no stabilizer.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.314
Land before it's too late!

18:02.314 --> 18:03.715
Just hold on!

18:03.715 --> 18:05.417
Cedric/Bert: Melissa?!?

18:05.417 --> 18:07.219
He's a madman,
I tell you!

18:07.219 --> 18:09.354
He'll stop at nothing to get me!

18:09.354 --> 18:12.391
The Pig: Have no fear, Sir!
I'll have to make the fans.

18:12.391 --> 18:14.093
Fear! Fear!

18:14.093 --> 18:15.727
I'm afraid of nothing!

18:15.727 --> 18:18.897
Look at my hand,
steady as the economy!

18:18.897 --> 18:20.866
I won't be taken
alive I tell you!

18:30.776 --> 18:32.111
Yeah.

18:33.112 --> 18:36.115
Yeaaaaah! Aaaauuuuu!

18:36.115 --> 18:39.351
What?! It's Cedric!
Shut down all systems!

18:39.351 --> 18:41.386
The Pig: But Sir, security!

18:41.386 --> 18:42.955
That's my son out there,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.858
and his security is the only
thing I'm worried about.

18:49.361 --> 18:50.629
Cedric/Bert: Yauuuuu!

18:53.799 --> 18:55.601
Are you two all right?

18:55.601 --> 18:59.371
Sure, but the question is,
are you all right?

18:59.371 --> 19:01.607
I'm fine,
why wouldn't I be?

19:02.774 --> 19:04.476
I-I did it!

19:04.476 --> 19:06.545
I was flying!

19:06.545 --> 19:09.615
Flying?! You were soaring.

19:09.615 --> 19:12.284
You conquered the sky!

19:12.284 --> 19:13.919
And your fear!

19:13.919 --> 19:16.488
That was some
display of courage.

19:16.488 --> 19:19.158
You know,
I never even thought about it.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.326
I.. just did it.

19:21.326 --> 19:25.631
Cedric! Cedric,
my son, are you all right?

19:25.631 --> 19:27.966
Sure, Pop. I was just...

19:27.966 --> 19:30.435
Wait a minute! No Snarl?!

19:30.435 --> 19:33.939
You mean to tell me that
this is just a false alarm?

19:33.939 --> 19:36.141
What's the idea of
fooling around like this?

19:36.141 --> 19:39.411
Don't you realize that
I'm under maximum security?

19:39.411 --> 19:41.313
You're tomfoolery
could have left me

19:41.313 --> 19:43.448
totally exposed.
The Pigs: B-b-but...

19:43.448 --> 19:45.584
While Karl Snarl
could have simply

19:45.584 --> 19:48.020
marched by here with
an army of a thousand men,

19:48.020 --> 19:50.322
without so much as a
finger being laid on him.

19:52.157 --> 19:54.660
Long time no see, Cyril.

19:57.029 --> 20:00.499
Hey Karl, baby, you
haven't changed a bit!

20:00.499 --> 20:01.767
When did you get in?

20:01.767 --> 20:05.370
The Pig 1: This is
Carl Snarl, the monster?!

20:05.370 --> 20:07.172
The Pigs:

20:07.172 --> 20:09.942
I've been hunting
you down for years, Cyril.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.710
and now finally,

20:11.710 --> 20:14.780
you're going to get
what you deserve.

20:14.780 --> 20:18.784
(laughs) Now, now,
wait a minute, Snarl.

20:18.784 --> 20:21.453
I..um...
Many years ago, Cyril,

20:21.453 --> 20:23.121
you left the company.

20:23.121 --> 20:25.891
I've never forgotten that.
Thank you.

20:25.891 --> 20:27.359
Ah.. what?!

20:27.359 --> 20:29.328
Well, you knew
it wasn't enough

20:29.328 --> 20:31.897
for the two of us to survive on.

20:31.897 --> 20:33.332
Well, I..I...

20:33.332 --> 20:36.735
But the business
proved to be a big success.

20:36.735 --> 20:40.005
I sold it recently for millions!

20:40.005 --> 20:43.408
And I've come
to give you your share.

20:43.408 --> 20:46.178
Really?! A big success?

20:46.178 --> 20:48.513
And you've come
to give me my share?

20:48.513 --> 20:50.816
Well, let's have it, Snarl.

20:50.816 --> 20:53.752
Yeah, this is your
share of the company, Cyril.

20:53.752 --> 20:58.590
Five dollars and
seventy five cents!

20:58.590 --> 20:59.725
What?!

20:59.725 --> 21:02.027
Your share at
the time you left, Cyril.

21:02.027 --> 21:04.129
It's a shame, you
didn't stick around.

21:04.129 --> 21:05.764
The morning you left, I landed

21:05.764 --> 21:08.567
one of the biggest
deals of all time.

21:11.403 --> 21:13.005
Uaaaaah!

21:17.242 --> 21:21.380
It's really
very simple to operate, Ralph.

21:21.380 --> 21:23.382
This lever is for up and down.

21:23.382 --> 21:26.585
I.. I-I can't do it, Melissa.

21:26.585 --> 21:27.953
I don't want to do it.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.422
...and this one is
for forward and backward.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.090
Don't make
us go backwards!

21:32.090 --> 21:34.259
Uaaaaaah!

21:34.259 --> 21:37.763
Try to relax Ralph.
Look at the details below.

21:37.763 --> 21:39.631
To heck with
the details, Melissa.

21:39.631 --> 21:42.134
I'm not taking my
hands away from my eyes.

21:42.134 --> 21:44.469
(barks happily!

21:44.469 --> 21:46.805
Uaaaaaah!

21:51.376 --> 21:55.314
I love it when Cyril
and his gold get separated.

21:56.281 --> 21:59.217
You know, nothing like
a fool and his money.
