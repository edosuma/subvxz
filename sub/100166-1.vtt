Ah. Kimmy Gibbler's growing up.

12:45.139 --> 12:46.307
I'm right behind you.

12:47.641 --> 12:49.643
I will not survive this day.

12:51.687 --> 12:53.355
Remember me as I was--

12:53.439 --> 12:55.483
the most beautiful boy in the world.

13:00.029 --> 13:01.280
Incoming!

13:01.363 --> 13:03.365
Aah. Aah. Aah. Aah.

13:03.449 --> 13:05.701
[clattering and crashing]

13:08.329 --> 13:11.457
Ah, to be young and in love and a Gibbler.

13:13.834 --> 13:16.003
Aren't you all three of those things?

13:17.797 --> 13:20.800
Grandpa, do you know where
we keep the family's baby-naming gown?

13:20.883 --> 13:23.594
-Yeah, I'd try the attic.
-We have an attic?

13:24.804 --> 13:26.722
Trust me, we have an attic.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.475
Just keep heading up the stairs
until you hit the roof.

13:32.061 --> 13:35.940
Ah, to be young and confused
and looking for baby clothes.

13:36.023 --> 13:37.107
[snickers]

13:38.317 --> 13:41.195
What... do... you... want?

13:43.155 --> 13:47.743
Okay. You know I think Steph
is the most incredible girl I've ever met,

13:47.827 --> 13:49.411
and with that in mind,

13:49.495 --> 13:50.663
-I was hoping that--
-Ow!

13:52.957 --> 13:54.375
Don't cry, Dan the Man.

13:57.920 --> 13:59.296
What did you want to ask?

13:59.880 --> 14:03.342
I think the better question would be
why are you hammering a screw?

14:05.177 --> 14:06.178
<i>♪ Ooh, ooh, ooh ♪ </i>

14:06.262 --> 14:07.388
<i>♪ La, la, la, la ♪</i>

14:10.140 --> 14:14.603
Hmm. We do have an attic.
Grandpa has not completely lost it.

14:15.354 --> 14:17.147
I found it. Aha.

14:17.231 --> 14:18.774
The baby-naming gown?

14:18.858 --> 14:20.776
No. An 8-track from the band a-ha.

14:23.529 --> 14:26.031
What can I say?
I'm a fan of Norwegian synth-pop.

14:29.910 --> 14:31.370
What's this old thing?

14:32.872 --> 14:36.375
Old thing? You're holding
a piece of cherished family history.

14:37.501 --> 14:40.713
This is Rigby,
Aunt Michelle's beloved stuffed rhino.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.133
How would you know that?

14:45.092 --> 14:47.761
We have eight years
of carefully curated home movies.

14:50.139 --> 14:51.640
It's almost like a TV show.

14:53.434 --> 14:56.353
You know, for a family
that prides itself on being normal,

14:56.437 --> 14:58.397
we have a lot of crazy stuff up here.

14:59.273 --> 15:01.066
I mean, Fred Flintstone outfit?

15:02.318 --> 15:04.028
Some... portrait of Fernando.

15:05.946 --> 15:07.615
Whatever... this thing is.

15:11.118 --> 15:13.287
That's Uncle Jesse's invention--

15:13.370 --> 15:15.080
the Spray Guard 2001.

15:16.957 --> 15:19.335
You guys really have to watch
these home movies.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.504
They get pretty crazy towards the end.

15:23.964 --> 15:25.424
Aunt Michelle got amnesia.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.930
You know what else is crazy?

15:31.013 --> 15:33.599
Someday, that kid downstairs
is gonna be up here,

15:33.682 --> 15:36.685
pawing through our junk
and making fun of how weird we were.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.188
We're not weird.

15:40.105 --> 15:43.525
Oh, look. It's my King Jaguarito mask
from my Mexican wrestling days.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.740
Oh, found it.

15:52.910 --> 15:54.578
I remember Tommy wearing that.

15:54.662 --> 15:56.747
Yeah, I remember you wearing that.

15:56.830 --> 15:58.207
Apparently, I wore it, too.

15:58.916 --> 16:03.545
I was born in the back of a rental car,
so my baby-naming gown was a floor mat.

16:05.547 --> 16:07.549
Look at us. Couple of crazy kids

16:07.633 --> 16:10.052
eating club sandwiches
in the middle of the day.

16:11.470 --> 16:12.680
With avocado.

16:15.015 --> 16:16.517
Mm-hmm. Avocado.

16:18.102 --> 16:20.604
Wait, you--
You're not on eHarmony, are you?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.816
I knew I should start working out.

16:24.984 --> 16:28.696
No. I'm watching a video feed
of the doula taking care of the baby.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.533
Oh, look at her. She is totally
gonna use the wrong nipple.

16:34.284 --> 16:36.578
The doula has her shirt off?
There's kids in the house.

16:36.662 --> 16:39.790
Wha-- I'm talking about the bottles.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.876
I switched the nipples
to try to trick the doula.

16:44.586 --> 16:45.921
Oh, she figured it out.

16:46.005 --> 16:48.090
Oh, she is good.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.845
You tried to trick the doula?
What's going on with you?

16:53.595 --> 16:54.596
Nothing. I...

16:55.723 --> 16:58.392
I just think it's crazy
that Stephanie hired a doula.

16:59.518 --> 17:03.689
Um... you tried to pull a sting
with a rubber nipple, so...

17:04.815 --> 17:06.525
not sure who the crazy one is.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.820
I always imagined that
when Stephanie brought the baby home,

17:09.903 --> 17:15.034
I'd be the one helping her through it,
not... some lady she met in a mosh pit.

17:15.117 --> 17:17.327
Yeah. Well, technically, it was a mud pit.

17:18.996 --> 17:20.622
I mean, I hate her.

17:24.209 --> 17:28.380
Look, I-I get it. You feel displaced,
but... she's only here for a week.

17:28.464 --> 17:31.675
And besides, you know Stephanie.
She's gonna do things her own way.

17:31.759 --> 17:33.385
Yeah, but I'm her big sister.

17:33.469 --> 17:35.888
It's my job to tell her what her way is.

17:36.930 --> 17:39.391
[muffled screaming]

17:43.979 --> 17:44.897
Oh, hey, guys.

17:47.441 --> 17:49.526
What are you doing with the pillow?

17:49.610 --> 17:52.071
Uh, what... what pillow?

17:54.239 --> 17:55.991
Why are you hiding your phone?

17:56.075 --> 17:59.495
Hiding? I'm not hiding.
I'm-I'm calling Steve.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.916
I don't know why he's not picking up.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.545
Uh, Steve Hale. Who's this?

18:12.049 --> 18:13.592
We're a great team, aren't we?

18:15.219 --> 18:17.096
How much longer
till we're done with this?

18:18.097 --> 18:21.683
Well, I think
just one more screw here, and...

18:21.767 --> 18:23.310
-<i>♪ Ta-da ♪</i>
-No, wait.

18:24.436 --> 18:25.521
Let me turn it on.

18:26.146 --> 18:27.147
I need a win.

18:28.899 --> 18:30.901
["Rock-a-bye Baby" playing]

18:33.695 --> 18:36.907
Huh. Doesn't make me
feel as important as I thought it would.

18:39.284 --> 18:40.285
[Danny sighs]

18:43.831 --> 18:45.582
There's other seats in the room.

18:46.583 --> 18:48.460
I know. I have something to ask you.

18:50.337 --> 18:52.631
Is it "Why am I
sitting so close to Danny?"

18:53.757 --> 18:56.468
'Cause I would like to know
the answer to that as well.

18:59.054 --> 19:02.015
You may not know this about me,
but I'm a pretty old-fashioned guy,

19:02.099 --> 19:04.351
and... I wanna do this right.

19:08.397 --> 19:10.899
Somehow this doesn't feel old-fashioned.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.986
I love Stephanie,

19:14.069 --> 19:16.405
and... I'd like to ask your permission

19:16.488 --> 19:18.949
to spend the rest of my life
as your son-in-law.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.077
[laughs]

19:23.078 --> 19:26.331
What? Did I say something wrong?
Did I call her Shpepanie by mistake?

19:26.415 --> 19:30.169
Sometimes I do that when I get nervous,
but I do know that her name is Shpepanie.

19:31.628 --> 19:33.297
No, you big goofball.

19:33.380 --> 19:36.675
I'm laughing because I know
you already asked her.

19:36.758 --> 19:39.595
Whoa. How did you see the past?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.180
Are you the Three-Eyed Raven?

19:42.556 --> 19:43.557
-Yes.
-Really?

19:43.640 --> 19:44.641
-No.
-Oh.

19:46.351 --> 19:48.979
She walked into the house
wearing an engagement ring.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.356
Darn, I told her to wear mittens.

19:54.484 --> 19:59.406
Listen. Jeremiah Jeffcoat
Johnson Jimmy Gibbler...

20:00.699 --> 20:03.160
I hereby give you my permission

20:03.243 --> 20:06.330
to... already have asked my daughter
to marry you.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.541
Aw, thanks, Dad.

20:12.502 --> 20:14.087
Or do you prefer Dan the Man?

20:15.547 --> 20:19.718
I prefer that you just make Shpephanie
as happy as you always have.

20:22.221 --> 20:25.682
By the way, how much
Eternity by Calvin Klein are you wearing?

20:26.516 --> 20:27.643
All of it.

20:31.146 --> 20:33.190
Whee! Whoo!

20:33.273 --> 20:35.317
Whoo! Hee hee hee.

20:35.400 --> 20:38.779
I'm not pregnant anymore. Ha ha.

20:45.661 --> 20:47.079
Aah-aah-aah!

20:49.206 --> 20:52.459
Kimberlina,
I don't want to die in a unitard.

20:55.128 --> 20:58.340
Nobody's dying today, Fernando.
Not on my watch.

20:58.423 --> 21:01.635
Oh, I haven't felt this alive
in nine months.

21:01.718 --> 21:03.971
Oh, I think I get it.

21:04.054 --> 21:06.473
You are running, rollerblading,

21:06.556 --> 21:08.934
and dangling away from your true feelings.

21:09.017 --> 21:11.353
No. I'm having a great time.

21:11.436 --> 21:13.480
Just enjoying my baby-free body.

21:14.147 --> 21:17.234
Nobody doting on me,
giving me their seat on the bus,

21:17.317 --> 21:19.319
or stomping on my bladder.

21:20.862 --> 21:22.406
You miss being pregnant.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.200
I miss it so much.

21:27.869 --> 21:29.663
I miss the night sweats.

21:29.746 --> 21:32.374
I miss the revulsion
at the smell of tandoori chicken.

21:33.083 --> 21:36.211
I miss the shoes that fit on one foot
but not the other.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.549
You'll always have stretch marks.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.468
Thank you, Fernando.

21:44.386 --> 21:46.513
That's so sweet of you to say.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.767
This past year, it's just been so exciting

21:50.851 --> 21:53.061
to be a part of something
bigger than myself.

21:53.854 --> 21:58.025
And now, I'm afraid my work is done,
and I'm not gonna be needed anymore.

21:58.567 --> 22:01.611
You're still going to be
a huge part of this baby's life.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.948
It won't be like it was,
but... think how great it'll be

22:05.032 --> 22:07.242
watching this girl grow up, huh?

22:07.326 --> 22:10.037
And it wouldn't have been possible
without you. Mwah.

22:10.120 --> 22:11.330
Thank you, honey.

22:15.417 --> 22:16.835
Aah!

22:16.918 --> 22:17.919
[thud]

22:26.386 --> 22:28.263
Yeah, funny story. Uh...

22:28.347 --> 22:31.808
my great-great-grand-cousin,
Hekekiah J. Tanner,

22:31.892 --> 22:35.062
he was thrown from a moving stagecoach
wearing that very gown.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.606
You could still see the hoof print
on the back. [laughs]

22:39.107 --> 22:40.108
It's not...

22:42.486 --> 22:46.323
You know, I... I really appreciate
all that you're doing for me,

22:46.406 --> 22:49.993
but, uh, I've got this baby-naming thing,
in, like, half an hour,

22:50.077 --> 22:51.995
and I still don't have a name yet.

22:52.079 --> 22:54.456
I thought maybe
spending time with the baby would--

22:54.539 --> 22:56.041
Shh. All done.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.046
But... But...

23:01.963 --> 23:05.342
No, but... I'm gonna wind up
calling this baby Hekekiah.

23:12.599 --> 23:16.269
-Hey, you need some help?
-No. No, it's fine. I've got it.

23:16.353 --> 23:18.313
Don't be ridiculous.
Let me help you with that.

23:18.397 --> 23:20.315
Deej, really. It--
I said I don't need help.

23:20.399 --> 23:23.819
Really. No. Deej, it's fine.
I can do it. D.J.

23:31.201 --> 23:32.452
Look what you did.

23:33.078 --> 23:35.664
I'm sorry. I just-- I was trying to help.

23:35.747 --> 23:38.708
Look, the last thing I need
is more help, okay?

23:38.792 --> 23:40.502
I have-I have more than enough help.

23:40.585 --> 23:43.046
I want to do something on my own
for my own baby.

23:43.630 --> 23:44.464
What do you mean?

23:44.548 --> 23:47.050
I thought you and your doula
were doing what doulas do.

23:47.759 --> 23:50.595
That's the problem.
She won't let me do anything.

23:50.679 --> 23:52.139
But you already know that

23:52.222 --> 23:54.766
'cause you've been watching us
on the nanny cam.

23:55.642 --> 23:57.769
That's right. I've been spying on the spy.

23:59.062 --> 24:02.607
Well, I was just making sure
that baby TBD

24:02.691 --> 24:05.485
was being cared for
in the way that I would care for her.

24:05.569 --> 24:08.947
If you let me care for her,
but you didn't.

24:09.030 --> 24:10.198
'Cause you don't care.

24:11.324 --> 24:13.452
And I ate a whole club sandwich!

24:18.331 --> 24:19.875
I know why I'm upset.

24:20.834 --> 24:22.043
Why are you upset?

24:23.753 --> 24:26.756
'Cause I just...
I wanted to be there for you

24:26.840 --> 24:29.676
the way that you were there for me
five years ago.

24:30.510 --> 24:33.388
You gave up your entire life
to come rescue mine.

24:34.306 --> 24:36.099
Just trying to repay the kindness.

24:38.393 --> 24:39.394
Oh.

24:40.437 --> 24:42.272
Why'd you have to go and be so D.J.?

24:43.440 --> 24:47.152
I feel awful for hiring this mean doula
to shield me from your goodness.

24:49.946 --> 24:53.492
-Wait. You don't like your doula?
-I hate her.

24:53.575 --> 24:57.412
Me too. Yeah, I think I saw her
bend a spoon with her mind.

24:59.080 --> 25:01.791
You know, it's funny.
I have spent my entire adult life...

25:02.459 --> 25:05.045
thinking that I couldn't have
children of my own, and...

25:05.795 --> 25:09.549
now she's here, and I just
hand the baby off to the Mistress of Fire.

25:11.301 --> 25:12.761
Yeah, she frightens me.

25:13.553 --> 25:15.305
Hey, we should set her up with Dad.

25:16.181 --> 25:18.183
[both chuckle]

25:20.227 --> 25:21.603
Oh.

25:21.686 --> 25:25.065
You know, this is
just not what I expected.

25:25.148 --> 25:28.193
I feel unprepared and overwhelmed
all at once.

25:29.152 --> 25:30.737
I haven't even named my baby yet.

25:32.030 --> 25:36.618
Yeah. You should probably do that
'cause I really need a name for the cake.

25:39.079 --> 25:41.081
What if my mom instincts never kick in?

25:42.332 --> 25:44.793
I mean, it all seemed
to come so naturally for you.

25:44.876 --> 25:47.379
Oh. [laughs]

25:47.462 --> 25:49.548
-What?
-Oh, man.

25:49.631 --> 25:51.550
When I had Jackson, I was a disaster.

25:52.217 --> 25:55.011
Yeah, I ended up
walking home with him from the hospital,

25:55.095 --> 25:58.223
because I wasn't sure
if the car seat was installed safely.

25:58.306 --> 26:01.309
So I walked the entire length
of Golden Gate Park

26:01.393 --> 26:04.062
with a newborn through a reggae festival.

26:05.188 --> 26:07.774
Man, Jackson
smelled like patchouli for a week.

26:10.026 --> 26:12.654
Uh, Deej... that wasn't patchouli.

26:17.242 --> 26:20.370
Look, the truth is, all parents
are a disaster in the beginning.

26:21.162 --> 26:25.750
Just don't measure yourself against
what you think someone else did.

26:25.834 --> 26:30.088
Just be you,  and I promise you,
you're gonna figure it out your own way.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.134
Thanks, Deej. I needed that.

26:36.761 --> 26:37.804
You're right.

26:38.805 --> 26:41.725
I'm gonna get rid of this doula
before she ruins all the spoons.

26:41.808 --> 26:43.059
Oh, let me! Let me!

26:43.143 --> 26:45.729
I have been daydreaming
about firing her all day.

26:47.606 --> 26:48.565
Be my guest.

26:48.648 --> 26:50.900
Yes, I'm gonna go dump the doula.

26:50.984 --> 26:54.237
Oh, I hope she back talks me,
'cause I can't wait to shush her.

26:56.489 --> 26:58.658
-Shush.
-What did I do?

26:58.742 --> 27:00.201
Sorry. I was just practicing.

27:03.913 --> 27:05.040
Wow.

27:05.123 --> 27:05.957
Hi, Dad.

27:06.750 --> 27:08.001
How's it going down here?

27:09.294 --> 27:11.546
Well, it's, uh, better than it was.

27:12.213 --> 27:15.925
Yeah, I was watching you guys fight
on the baby monitor,

27:16.009 --> 27:18.803
and then I come down here,
and you're already made up.

27:20.347 --> 27:22.515
It's like nobody needs me anymore.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.602
Dad.

27:27.687 --> 27:30.482
I had no idea how you were gonna
make this about you.

27:32.609 --> 27:34.861
Well, it's kind of my superpower.

27:36.279 --> 27:40.367
You know, I spent all day
basically feeling sorry for myself.

27:40.450 --> 27:42.619
Like I was no longer needed as a parent.

27:43.787 --> 27:47.666
But then when I saw you guys
resolving your own issues,

27:47.749 --> 27:49.668
that pretty much confirmed it for me.

27:51.878 --> 27:55.882
It's ironic that one of the hardest parts
about being a parent...

27:55.965 --> 27:59.844
is that if you're good at it,
eventually you're out of a job.

28:01.554 --> 28:03.973
Did you just call yourself a good parent?

28:04.057 --> 28:06.601
Well, I did say it was my superpower.

28:07.602 --> 28:09.562
[Stephanie chuckles]

28:09.646 --> 28:10.647
Dad...

28:12.190 --> 28:15.193
I might not need you the same way I did
when I was young, but...

28:16.236 --> 28:17.487
I'll always need you.

28:20.073 --> 28:20.907
Thanks, Steph.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.244
I am so proud of you.

28:25.286 --> 28:26.287
Thanks, Dad.

28:27.497 --> 28:29.708
It's 'cause of everything you did for me.

28:31.334 --> 28:32.335
You know?

28:33.962 --> 28:37.090
I've been a parent for two days,
and I have... no idea

28:37.173 --> 28:38.591
how you raised three of us.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.635
But thank you.

28:46.266 --> 28:47.767
Ooh, sorry.

28:47.851 --> 28:49.519
Oh, don't-don't worry about it.

28:49.602 --> 28:53.314
Oh, by the way,
I-I gave my blessings to your fiancé.

28:54.232 --> 28:56.526
So not only are you an amazing couple,

28:56.609 --> 28:59.362
but now you are going to be
an amazing family.

29:00.113 --> 29:03.450
Oh, crap. I totally forgot
I'm getting married, too.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.454
Would now be a bad time
to ask you for $50,000?

29:10.749 --> 29:13.126
See? Told you I'll always need you.

29:17.297 --> 29:18.465
Okay, everybody.

29:18.548 --> 29:22.177
All right, I'd like to take a moment,
if I could, to make this all about me.

29:24.387 --> 29:27.140
It was my great-great-grand-cousin
Hekekiah who said...

29:27.223 --> 29:29.058
-[all groan]
-Okay, fine.

29:29.142 --> 29:31.352
I'm gonna need
everybody's neck pillows back.

29:33.646 --> 29:36.065
Well, thank you all for being here.

29:36.149 --> 29:39.152
Everyone in this room
holds a special place in our hearts.

29:39.235 --> 29:42.906
But none more so than the person
that we've named this baby after.

29:42.989 --> 29:45.617
Baby Ramona, baby Ramona, baby Ramona.

29:48.119 --> 29:49.621
You know, to be honest,

29:49.704 --> 29:52.707
I had no idea what this baby's name
was gonna be 28 minutes ago.

29:54.125 --> 29:55.251
But then I realized.

29:55.960 --> 29:57.879
There's been one constant in my life.

29:58.755 --> 30:00.590
Somebody who loved me no matter what.

30:01.549 --> 30:07.013
And... every day, through his example,
he showed me what it means to be a parent.

30:07.931 --> 30:11.100
So I'd like to introduce you
to our daughter Danielle.

30:11.935 --> 30:15.104
Or as we like to call her--Dani Tanner.

30:17.857 --> 30:19.442
It is about me.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.073
That is so sweet.
Thank you so much, honey.

30:32.080 --> 30:33.873
Well, it's not just about you, Dad.

30:33.957 --> 30:36.960
You're not the only person in this room
that I've looked up to my entire life.

30:38.002 --> 30:40.088
Our baby's middle name will be Jo.

30:40.171 --> 30:44.509
So... if someone someday
wants to call her D.J...

30:45.343 --> 30:47.095
there'd be no better honor.

30:47.971 --> 30:49.973
It's about me, too.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.060
Oh. Thank you.

30:55.687 --> 30:57.564
I love you so much.

30:58.648 --> 31:01.109
I am gonna try really hard
not to cry on the baby.

31:02.110 --> 31:03.111
Too late.

31:05.446 --> 31:08.616
Well, save your crying.
I'm not done passing out tears yet.

31:08.700 --> 31:10.743
I don't think I can take any more.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.662
I did not properly pace myself.

31:15.748 --> 31:18.418
I bet they're gonna name me
the baby's foot doctor.

31:20.795 --> 31:24.173
Finally... there is one person here who...

31:24.841 --> 31:28.678
although not born into the family
is as much a part of it as all of you are,

31:28.761 --> 31:30.263
and without whom...

31:31.222 --> 31:33.266
this truly would not have been possible.

31:34.058 --> 31:36.436
So... my baby's godmother...

31:37.270 --> 31:38.438
is Kimmy Gibbler.

31:39.981 --> 31:42.692
She likes me. She really, really likes me.

31:45.111 --> 31:46.404
-Thanks, Steph.
-Yeah.

31:47.113 --> 31:48.865
Okay, Ramona.

31:48.948 --> 31:51.367
-Whisper she-wolf howl on three?
-Okay.

31:51.451 --> 31:53.453
One, two, three.

Kid, you and I

32:04.839 --> 32:08.509
have had some pretty special times
over the last nine months,

32:08.593 --> 32:11.721
and just because you're not gonna be
riding around in my belly anymore,

32:11.804 --> 32:14.349
I want you to know
that that's not gonna end.

32:15.058 --> 32:16.976
I will always be there for you.

32:27.320 --> 32:29.864
If you ever want to learn how
to ride a unicycle...

32:30.865 --> 32:32.492
or dress up as Mrs. Doubtfire...

32:33.493 --> 32:34.953
or box a kangaroo...

32:35.870 --> 32:36.871
I'm here.

32:37.705 --> 32:40.625
And, you know,
you picked a really fun place to live.

32:40.708 --> 32:44.295
There's lots of hugging
and singing and dancing...

32:44.379 --> 32:45.797
and that's just at breakfast.

32:50.551 --> 32:52.887
You guys did good.

32:52.971 --> 32:54.180
We all did.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.814
I don't think there'll be a baby
more loved than this one.

33:03.773 --> 33:06.359
But for the record,
my baby is not boxing any kangaroos.

33:08.444 --> 33:11.906

she is half Gibbler.
