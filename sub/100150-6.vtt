WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:09.301
(watch ticking)

00:15.850 --> 00:17.435
You're making a quick getaway.

00:17.476 --> 00:20.271
Yeah, I've got to get
to Greensboro.

00:20.312 --> 00:23.315
I've got some sales calls
that just won't wait.

00:41.584 --> 00:44.545
I kind of wanted to say goodbye
to Thomas before I left.

00:44.587 --> 00:45.713
ALT-HELEN:
He was gone already

00:45.796 --> 00:48.632
when I got up, with no word.

00:48.674 --> 00:52.887
He usually leaves a note
when he's gone fishing.

00:52.928 --> 00:54.555
Here.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.059
-Thank you.
-What's got you so anxious?

01:01.103 --> 01:03.439
Uh, I guess my head's

01:03.481 --> 01:06.317
is in work already, you know?

01:06.358 --> 01:10.696
Uh, yeah, I may be,
um, on the road

01:10.738 --> 01:11.947
a little longer than usual,

01:11.989 --> 01:13.240
might be difficult
to make calls.

01:13.282 --> 01:15.451
Are you gonna tell me
what's going on?

01:15.493 --> 01:18.579
What? No. I just...

01:18.621 --> 01:22.124
Uh... My work numbers are down

01:22.166 --> 01:25.169
and I just got to put in
a few more hours, that's all.

01:25.211 --> 01:26.670
That's not what
I'm talking about, John.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.632
-Well, what, then?
-The fight

01:29.673 --> 01:31.634
last night with Thomas,

01:31.675 --> 01:34.720
and then Daniel.

01:34.762 --> 01:37.097
You've never been this dark.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.102
-I'm the same as I always was.
-If there's something

01:42.144 --> 01:43.938
going on, you can tell me.

01:43.979 --> 01:46.315
Whatever it is.
We've always had that.

01:46.357 --> 01:50.653
We have, and that's why
you should believe me now.

01:50.694 --> 01:53.322
But I don't.

01:55.366 --> 01:57.868
(chuckles) Well, then...
(stammers)

01:57.910 --> 01:59.912
We definitely got to talk,
but right now

01:59.954 --> 02:01.831
it's just got to wait
'cause I...

02:01.872 --> 02:03.541
-Sales calls...
-Yeah.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.126
I'm-I'm glad I saw you
before you left.

02:06.168 --> 02:08.754
-Listen...
-I did it.

02:10.130 --> 02:12.967
I thought we were
gonna talk about this.

02:13.008 --> 02:15.344
I didn't really see any reason
to drag it out any longer.

02:15.386 --> 02:17.638
My recruiter's coming by
in a little while to give me

02:17.680 --> 02:19.515
and a group of other guys
a ride to Parris Island.

02:19.557 --> 02:21.100
-What?
-I need to get my bag packed.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.436
Jesus, whoo...
No, it's too soon. John...

02:24.478 --> 02:26.146
It's okay. We can handle this.

02:26.188 --> 02:27.731
I'm gonna put in a call
to the recruiter.

02:27.773 --> 02:29.191
You acted rashly, Thomas.
I shouldn't have

02:29.233 --> 02:31.026
-said those thing. I'm sorry.
-No, no, no, no, no.

02:31.068 --> 02:34.446
I've been thinking about this
for a long time now.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.490
This is my choice.

02:42.872 --> 02:46.292
ALT-HELEN:
Oh, this is all
happening so quickly.

02:46.333 --> 02:48.586
John, if you had just
spoken to him calmly

02:48.627 --> 02:49.837
last night, you could've

02:49.879 --> 02:52.423
-talked some sense into him.
-What are you implying?

02:52.464 --> 02:54.258
Well, that you of all people

02:54.300 --> 02:56.385
would know how to speak
to our son.

02:56.427 --> 02:59.263
Oh, so this is all my fault?
This had nothing to do with you?

02:59.305 --> 03:01.515
What are you talking about?

03:07.646 --> 03:11.400
I-I-I got to get some air...

03:11.442 --> 03:14.653
-and think this through.
-(door opens, closes)

03:31.587 --> 03:34.924
(van doors closing)

03:34.965 --> 03:36.550
Gentlemen.

03:36.592 --> 03:39.178
I'm sorry to say there's been
a misunderstanding here.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.764
Um, my son Thomas, he's, uh,

03:41.805 --> 03:45.476
reconsidered his decision.

03:45.517 --> 03:47.770
Don't worry, Mr. Smith. We'll
take good care of your boy.

03:47.811 --> 03:49.980
-No, you won't.
-Excuse me?

03:50.022 --> 03:52.107
You think I don't know
how this ends?

03:52.149 --> 03:54.401
I understand, Mr. Smith.

03:54.443 --> 03:57.196
It's only natural
to be concerned about your son.

03:57.237 --> 03:59.406
Yes, it is.

03:59.448 --> 04:01.867
I'm sorry, sir. He's 18.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.621
-He signed the papers.
-I won't let you take him.

04:05.663 --> 04:08.207
Dad, it's done. I'm going.

04:08.248 --> 04:09.792
I won't let you.

04:09.833 --> 04:11.126
My boy.

04:11.168 --> 04:13.796
-I love you.
-Bye.

04:16.340 --> 04:17.549
Thomas.

04:17.591 --> 04:20.135
Is there anything that
I could've said yesterday

04:20.177 --> 04:22.888
that would have made you
change your mind?

04:22.930 --> 04:24.974
It doesn't matter now.

04:25.015 --> 04:27.017
Be proud of me.

04:28.394 --> 04:31.355
But I've always been proud
of you, Thomas.

04:32.398 --> 04:33.983
Goodbye.

It might actually
be good for him.

06:06.909 --> 06:08.327
And this-this thing in Vietnam,

06:08.368 --> 06:10.412
-it's gonna blow over quickly.
-(watch ticking)

06:10.454 --> 06:14.124
He might not even have
to be sent into combat.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.335
(normal voice):
John.

06:16.376 --> 06:19.755
John, say something.

06:19.797 --> 06:23.217
It's-it's like
some terrible joke.

06:23.258 --> 06:24.718
A joke?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.136
What does that mean?

06:29.181 --> 06:31.225
I got to get back.

06:31.266 --> 06:32.559
I-I have to leave.

06:33.602 --> 06:35.437
What?

06:35.479 --> 06:37.147
Our son just went to war,

06:37.189 --> 06:38.690
a-and you're
leaving me here alone?

06:38.732 --> 06:40.192
Listen, I can fix this, Helen.

06:40.234 --> 06:43.028
There's a way, somehow,
and I'm gonna find it.

06:43.070 --> 06:45.405
But I'm running out of time.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.366
What are you talking about? What
could possibly be more important

06:47.407 --> 06:48.700
-than this right now?
-I'm gonna go away. Listen.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.744
You may not hear from me
for a while, but I'm not gone.

06:50.786 --> 06:53.580
Okay? I can't explain.

06:53.622 --> 06:57.918
Just understand
I'm not gonna let this happen.

06:57.960 --> 07:00.879
I d... I don't understand.

07:01.922 --> 07:03.882
I'm sorry, Helen.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.760
(engine starts)

07:25.028 --> 07:27.823
(indistinct chatter over P.A.)

07:27.865 --> 07:29.908
Welcome back, Reichsmarschall.

07:29.950 --> 07:32.870
Get my clothes.

07:32.911 --> 07:34.872
I want to talk to Abendsen.

07:36.248 --> 07:38.208
ABENDSEN:
Rachel Chrisalms

07:38.250 --> 07:41.295
thought elections
were a keen idea.

07:41.336 --> 07:44.131
Why not decide the fate
of America

07:44.173 --> 07:46.633
with a popularity contest?

07:46.675 --> 07:49.261
Rachel's dalliance

07:49.303 --> 07:51.471
with democracy has earned her

07:51.513 --> 07:53.599
a tailor-made straitjacket

07:53.640 --> 07:56.768
and a ticket on a bullet train

07:56.810 --> 07:59.354
-bound for Crazytown.
-BELLOWS: Yep.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.481
-They turned him.
-Population one.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.442
-Poor bastard.
-Quiet. Shh.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.360
One second, please.

08:05.402 --> 08:08.780
Join me, your host,
Hawthorne Abendsen,

08:08.822 --> 08:12.201
aboard that patrol
as it hurtles

08:12.242 --> 08:15.954
towards its final destination:
the High Castle.

08:15.996 --> 08:18.540
JULIANA:
Turn it off.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.294
I'm trying to write it down.
I...

08:22.336 --> 08:24.504
It's the Ministry of Propaganda
writes this shit,

08:24.546 --> 08:26.089
-not Abendsen.
-You don't know him.

08:26.131 --> 08:27.674
You don't know
how his mind works.

08:27.716 --> 08:30.969
He thrives on riddles
and puzzles and paradoxes.

08:31.011 --> 08:33.263
"Straitjacket." "Dalliance."

08:33.305 --> 08:35.265
"Crazytown."

08:35.307 --> 08:36.850
"Bullet."

08:36.892 --> 08:38.852
But...

08:38.894 --> 08:41.438
Abendsen wrote this.

08:41.480 --> 08:42.731
What does it mean?

08:42.773 --> 08:44.691
That I don't know.

08:47.778 --> 08:49.780
(alarm blares, door opens)

08:56.703 --> 08:59.706
Didn't go how you expected, huh?

09:00.832 --> 09:04.503
Well, you're not the first one

09:04.544 --> 09:07.673
to try to steal fire

09:07.714 --> 09:09.716
from the gods, John.

09:12.177 --> 09:15.138
There were complications.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.474
Course there were.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.268
But they can be dealt with.

09:19.309 --> 09:21.645
Hmm.

09:22.688 --> 09:25.857
What happened over there, John?

09:25.899 --> 09:30.404
You found him, your boy,
alive and well.

09:30.445 --> 09:33.031
Helen and the girls.

09:34.408 --> 09:37.786
Uh, no, um...

09:37.828 --> 09:40.247
In that world,

09:40.289 --> 09:43.125
my girls were never born.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.585
Something found,

09:45.627 --> 09:48.213
something lost.

09:48.255 --> 09:50.799
Did you imagine

09:50.841 --> 09:53.385
slipping away to that world
for good?

09:53.427 --> 09:55.304
Of course you did.

09:55.345 --> 09:58.140
But it isn't that easy, is it?

09:58.181 --> 10:02.060
Now you're caught betwixt,
in between.

10:02.102 --> 10:05.105
I have
unfinished business there.

10:07.107 --> 10:10.068
My son may need my help.

10:10.110 --> 10:13.697
But first, I need to understand

10:13.739 --> 10:15.866
the repercussions

10:15.907 --> 10:18.076
if I interfere.

10:18.118 --> 10:20.078
You already have, John.

10:20.120 --> 10:21.747
You're already living
with the repercussions.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.290
Yes, but I can fix it.

10:23.332 --> 10:24.708
You sure about that?

10:24.750 --> 10:27.169
I'm not gonna lose my son again.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.883
(breathing heavily)

10:32.924 --> 10:35.135
(man screaming)

10:35.177 --> 10:37.054
-(gunshots)
-(whimpering)

10:37.095 --> 10:39.181
(woman screams)

10:41.391 --> 10:42.893
-(woman screams)
-(baby crying)

10:42.934 --> 10:46.021
(grunting)

10:49.441 --> 10:50.984
-(grunting)
-(man groans)

10:51.026 --> 10:53.028
(panting)

11:11.880 --> 11:14.299
(panting)

11:21.515 --> 11:24.851
You owe Mr. Okami.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.271
(wind gusting)

11:36.446 --> 11:39.533
KIDO (on tape):
We found a partial print

11:39.574 --> 11:42.786
on the clip inside the pistol.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.622
It is yours.

11:45.664 --> 11:48.250
IIJIMA:
Next time, I promise
to be more vigilant.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.744
(keys jangling)

12:31.835 --> 12:34.713
(bird cawing in distance)

12:50.520 --> 12:53.857
I remember you, Kido Taisa.

12:53.899 --> 12:56.401
Since we first met

12:56.443 --> 12:59.613
all those years ago
in Singapore.

12:59.654 --> 13:02.908
Admiral Inokuchi,
you are facing court-martial.

13:02.949 --> 13:06.536
Are there any witnesses you wish
to call for your defense?

13:06.578 --> 13:09.664
-What has become of you, Taisa?
-It is my duty

13:09.706 --> 13:11.917
to remind you of your rights.

13:11.958 --> 13:14.669
Your military command
and your freedom are at stake.

13:14.711 --> 13:16.713
This court-martial is a sham.

13:16.755 --> 13:18.131
Under Japanese law,

13:18.173 --> 13:20.926
I have a right to a Navy
court-martial in Tokyo.

13:20.967 --> 13:24.930
You are on trial
for consorting with the enemy.

13:24.971 --> 13:27.599
You know the sentence
this charge carries.

13:27.641 --> 13:30.060
I do.

13:33.396 --> 13:35.941
Did you undertake this meeting

13:35.982 --> 13:39.152
with Equiano Hampton
on your own...

13:39.194 --> 13:41.738
or did you have allies?

13:41.780 --> 13:44.783
I keep my promises.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.160
Do you keep yours?

13:50.956 --> 13:54.084
I am freer man
inside this jail cell

13:54.125 --> 13:57.087
than you are out there.

13:57.128 --> 14:01.091
You are a puppet dancing
on Yamori's strings.

14:01.132 --> 14:03.093
Enough!
Shut your mouth, traitor!

14:06.054 --> 14:09.724
You do not remember
when Japan was starving,

14:09.766 --> 14:13.103
when our families
could not provide for us.

14:14.479 --> 14:17.148
You have conspired
against your own people.

14:17.190 --> 14:20.318
Now you will face justice alone.

14:28.201 --> 14:30.203
KIDO:
Admiral Inokuchi refuses

14:30.245 --> 14:32.080
to call witnesses on his behalf.

14:32.122 --> 14:33.957
As good as admitting
he's guilty.

14:33.999 --> 14:36.084
This court-martial
should be in Tokyo

14:36.126 --> 14:38.920
-with a jury of naval officers.
-We do not have that luxury.

14:38.962 --> 14:42.215
It could be seen in Japan
as illegitimate.

14:42.257 --> 14:45.051
That is why
we have to move quickly.

14:45.093 --> 14:46.469
Your Highness.

14:49.222 --> 14:51.057
Where is Admiral Inokuchi?

14:52.851 --> 14:55.020
The admiral has been arrested.

14:55.061 --> 14:57.480
He stands accused
of colluding with the terrorist

14:57.522 --> 14:59.608
-Equiano Hampton.
-He was there

14:59.649 --> 15:01.651
on my instruction.

15:01.693 --> 15:05.739
YAMORI:
Your compassion for the accused

15:05.780 --> 15:07.240
is noble, Your Highness, but...

15:07.282 --> 15:10.368
Are you suggesting
I am lying to protect him?

15:13.413 --> 15:15.373
For your own protection,

15:15.415 --> 15:17.334
we are confining you
to your quarters.

15:20.128 --> 15:23.006
And if I refuse?

15:23.048 --> 15:25.717
The emperor would not forgive me
if I did not protect you

15:25.759 --> 15:28.428
during these volatile times.

15:40.357 --> 15:41.733
SAITO:
Iijima.

15:44.027 --> 15:46.446
Disconnect her phone lines.

15:50.617 --> 15:53.828
Stiffen your spine, Kido Taisa.

15:54.954 --> 15:57.165
Remember the cause.

16:04.047 --> 16:05.840
JUNIOR:
Peace talks?

16:05.882 --> 16:08.259
L.A. never signed off on this.

16:08.301 --> 16:10.970
Now, who decided
we could trust this admiral?

16:11.012 --> 16:13.640
-ELIJAH: Equiano did.
-Nah. You got set up.

16:13.682 --> 16:15.475
Man, shut the fuck up.
You don't know shit.

16:15.517 --> 16:17.102
Inokuchi's men
was getting shot at, too.

16:17.143 --> 16:18.395
Fuck you know about that, huh?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.939
He didn't know this was coming
any more than we did.

16:20.980 --> 16:23.983
There'll be plenty of time
to hand out blame later.

16:24.025 --> 16:25.735
We got bigger problems now.

16:25.777 --> 16:28.363
Empire Radio says we're beaten.

16:28.405 --> 16:30.448
Soon our own people
are going to believe them.

16:30.490 --> 16:32.534
Sister, if you want
to serve the revolution,

16:32.575 --> 16:34.869
why don't you start
by getting us something to eat.

16:34.911 --> 16:37.664
I am not here
to serve you, brother.

16:37.706 --> 16:40.375
The next stage
has to happen right now.

16:40.417 --> 16:43.461
We have got to send a message
that we are still here,

16:43.503 --> 16:46.506
-or this all falls apart.
-We need to hear from China.

16:46.548 --> 16:48.466
-From Ch...?
-LEON: Is that where we're at?

16:48.508 --> 16:49.551
We're trading one master
for another?

16:49.592 --> 16:51.219
There's more to this
than you understand.

16:51.261 --> 16:52.971
JUNIOR:
You stepping
into Equiano's shoes, Pops?

16:53.012 --> 16:56.224
Because maybe it's time
for L.A. to run things.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.401
Here you go.

17:11.781 --> 17:15.660
Seems they always wind up
fighting each other.

17:15.702 --> 17:18.121
That's what men do when
they're scared-- they fight.

17:18.163 --> 17:20.582
I'm scared, too.

17:21.624 --> 17:23.293
You're not wrong.

17:27.005 --> 17:29.090
What camp were you in?

17:33.678 --> 17:35.305
(sets cup down)

17:38.600 --> 17:40.935
Like knows like, honey.

17:44.522 --> 17:46.232
(sniffs)

17:46.274 --> 17:48.026
(sets cup down)

17:52.489 --> 17:55.074
Moulton, Alabama.

18:00.538 --> 18:03.958
The day I turned 13...

18:04.000 --> 18:06.252
one of the Aufseherin
at the camp

18:06.294 --> 18:09.172
told me to step out of line
and follow her.

18:10.715 --> 18:13.927
I was still a child.

18:13.968 --> 18:16.971
Thought it was a surprise
for my birthday.

18:19.641 --> 18:22.185
Nurse told me I was gonna be...

18:22.227 --> 18:24.938
fixed...

18:24.979 --> 18:28.483
so I could work
but I couldn't breed.

18:28.525 --> 18:32.111
I didn't know what
she was talking about.

18:32.153 --> 18:34.447
I remember I just said,

18:34.489 --> 18:37.325
"Thank you."

18:37.367 --> 18:41.079
'Cause that's what my mama
had always taught me to say.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.331
We escaped the camp.

18:43.373 --> 18:45.333
The wound was infected.

18:45.375 --> 18:47.752
By the time
the truck got to Oakland,

18:47.794 --> 18:49.754
I was close to dying.

18:49.796 --> 18:51.965
They brought me
to an underground hospital.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.884
The movement brought me back,

18:54.926 --> 18:57.679
fed me, clothed me, educated me.

18:57.720 --> 18:58.972
All of us.

18:59.013 --> 19:01.140
They saved all of us.

19:01.182 --> 19:05.353
It was years before I met
the man who started it.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.399
Now he's dead.

19:18.366 --> 19:21.870
How many tactical units
we have up here?

19:21.911 --> 19:23.663
Twenty-two.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.668
What's our operational reach?

19:30.628 --> 19:34.382
San Jose to the south...

19:34.424 --> 19:37.260
Eureka to the north,
east to the Neutral Zone.

19:46.603 --> 19:48.938
-Man, you can go it alone.
-And I'll take
my troops with me.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.982
Ain't no reason for L.A.
to answer to Oakland.

19:51.024 --> 19:53.735
Portland. Eureka. Santa Rosa.

19:53.776 --> 19:56.446
Oakland. San Jose.

19:56.487 --> 19:58.031
You know what they have
in common?

19:58.072 --> 19:59.490
I'm not sure what you're saying.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.659
BELL:
This...

20:01.701 --> 20:03.661
is the Crimson Pipeline.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.623
Carries oil to the Port of
Oakland for transport to Japan.

20:06.664 --> 20:09.834
That oil is the lifeblood
of the Empire's war with China.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.045
With enough explosives,
we can cut that vein.

20:12.086 --> 20:13.755
Stops them in their tracks.

20:13.796 --> 20:16.716
Everyone thinks
the movement died with Equiano.

20:16.758 --> 20:19.427
We have to show them
we're still here.

20:19.469 --> 20:21.930
(sighs)

20:25.141 --> 20:27.101
(chuckles):
Well, look at you.

20:27.143 --> 20:29.103
You're a natural
with that icing.

20:29.145 --> 20:31.397
The best part is licking
the knife when it's over.

20:31.439 --> 20:33.608
(chuckles)
I think so, too.

20:33.650 --> 20:36.110
I'm so glad to be back.
Aren't you?

20:36.152 --> 20:37.528
Sure.

20:37.570 --> 20:40.239
I hated the Neutral Zone.

20:40.281 --> 20:43.660
Well, I suppose you are
a real city girl.

20:43.701 --> 20:45.912
-I'm an Aryan girl.
-(chuckles)

20:45.954 --> 20:48.289
That you are.

20:48.331 --> 20:50.792
What... Amy, you
can't make them all vanilla.

20:50.833 --> 20:52.794
Vanilla's Daddy's favorite.

20:52.835 --> 20:56.381
Yes, but your father's not
the only one who likes cupcakes.

20:56.422 --> 20:59.634
(helicopter blades whirring
in distance)

20:59.676 --> 21:01.344
Mom?

21:01.386 --> 21:03.513
Yeah?

21:03.554 --> 21:05.974
Do you still love Daddy?

21:07.475 --> 21:10.228
What makes you ask that?

21:10.269 --> 21:12.897
You don't seem happy
when he's around.

21:15.233 --> 21:16.526
(sighs):
Well...

21:16.567 --> 21:18.528
we can't be happy all the time.

21:18.569 --> 21:20.571
But you're supposed to be.

21:20.613 --> 21:22.991
If not, something's wrong.

21:24.033 --> 21:26.369
I don't know about that.

21:26.411 --> 21:29.664
I think that people's feelings
are complicated.

21:29.706 --> 21:31.749
What if you went to one
of those reeducation camps?

21:33.376 --> 21:35.753
Why would I do that?

21:35.795 --> 21:38.256
You can't love your family
if you don't love your race.

21:38.297 --> 21:40.049
Everybody knows that.

21:42.969 --> 21:45.346
Where did you hear
about these camps?

21:45.388 --> 21:47.807
Everybody at school
knows about them.

21:47.849 --> 21:49.475
Mr. Phipps,
the chemistry teacher,

21:49.517 --> 21:51.060
he went to one.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.354
Why?

21:53.396 --> 21:56.149
He was a degen...

21:56.190 --> 21:57.900
-Degenerate?
-That's it.

21:57.942 --> 21:59.444
I don't know
what it means exactly,

21:59.485 --> 22:00.820
but I know it's bad.

22:02.238 --> 22:04.240
Where is Mr. Phipps now?

22:10.747 --> 22:13.124
You know, most people
who go to those camps--

22:13.166 --> 22:15.418
they never come back.

22:17.503 --> 22:20.339
I'm gonna make a special cupcake
just for Daddy.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.430
WYATT:
Forget about Helen Smith.

22:27.472 --> 22:29.849
She's never gonna help us.
It's not worth the risk.

22:29.891 --> 22:32.560
Look, I'm going to New York.
You're not gonna change my mind.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.145
I wouldn't let any of my people

22:34.187 --> 22:35.646
-pull something like this.
-Well, you know what?

22:35.688 --> 22:37.065
I'm not one of your people.

22:37.106 --> 22:38.983
And what makes you think
we can turn her?

22:39.025 --> 22:41.611
-I know Helen.
-Yeah, she's the wife
of an SS officer.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.488
The other version of her
is a churchgoing woman

22:43.529 --> 22:45.615
who devotes her days to helping
others. She helped me.

22:45.656 --> 22:48.326
In that world, maybe,
but not in this one.

22:48.367 --> 22:49.744
No, in this one, too.

22:49.786 --> 22:51.537
Look, I've seen her in both.

22:51.579 --> 22:54.415
That quality is in her, and
I know what she's capable of.

22:54.457 --> 22:56.751
She's one of the most protected
women in the Reich.

22:56.793 --> 22:59.045
-You're one of the most wanted.
-Yeah. I'll figure it out.

22:59.087 --> 23:02.006
And even if we put a bullet in
John Smith, what will it change?

23:02.048 --> 23:03.382
There'll just be another general

23:03.424 --> 23:04.801
waiting in line
to take his place.

23:04.842 --> 23:06.260
Well, he's not just a general.

23:06.302 --> 23:08.429
He's the key.

23:08.471 --> 23:10.389
Whoever controls the portal
controls the future.

23:10.431 --> 23:11.849
Do you understand that?

23:11.891 --> 23:15.311
All of this is based on visions
that you've had.

23:15.353 --> 23:18.356
And I believe you,
but for some of my men,

23:18.397 --> 23:20.566
it's a stretch.

23:20.608 --> 23:22.360
Yeah, well, I'm going.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.738
I won't let you.

23:27.448 --> 23:29.450
Look, Liam...

23:31.828 --> 23:33.830
All right.

23:35.915 --> 23:37.917
But I'm going with you.

23:42.755 --> 23:44.924
You have really beautiful
cursive writing, Amy.

23:44.966 --> 23:46.634
I practice it a lot.

23:46.676 --> 23:48.386
I'm not surprised.

23:48.427 --> 23:51.180
You have to practice things
if you want to get good at them.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.599
I agree.

23:53.641 --> 23:56.811
What do you have to learn to
become a Staatspolizei officer?

23:56.853 --> 23:58.563
Would you like to become one?

23:58.604 --> 24:00.398
That or a veterinarian.

24:00.439 --> 24:03.401
Hmm. Maybe some day I'll take
you to visit our headquarters.

24:03.442 --> 24:05.695
-How does that sound?
-I'd like that.

24:09.115 --> 24:11.450
All the girls in school
are wearing German braids,

24:11.492 --> 24:13.744
but my mom won't make them
for me.

24:13.786 --> 24:16.038
Maybe that's 'cause
she doesn't know how.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.416
They had different styles
when she was a girl.

24:18.457 --> 24:20.418
I grew up with them.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.712
-I can make them for you.
-You can?

24:22.753 --> 24:24.755
Sure. Slide back.

24:34.974 --> 24:36.976
Maybe another time, Amy.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.897
(helicopter blades whirring)

24:46.694 --> 24:48.279
(mouse squeaking)

24:48.321 --> 24:50.156
(man shouting indistinctly
in distance)

24:50.198 --> 24:52.491
(distant bells tinkling)

24:52.533 --> 24:54.869
(mouse squeaking,
distant shouting)

24:56.579 --> 24:58.289
YUKIKO:
Robert?

24:58.331 --> 25:00.541
(footsteps approaching)

25:00.583 --> 25:03.002
(indistinct shouting continues
in distance)

25:07.298 --> 25:09.467
I've come full circle.

25:09.508 --> 25:11.552
I'm back to eating mice.

25:11.594 --> 25:13.596
I'm a mouse-eater.

25:13.638 --> 25:16.432
I made a bowl of udon for you

25:16.474 --> 25:18.976
to keep up your strength.

25:20.019 --> 25:21.979
I can get us food.

25:22.021 --> 25:23.981
I can move freely.

25:24.023 --> 25:27.818
Yeah, well, I can't.

25:27.860 --> 25:29.487
(Childan sighs)

25:29.528 --> 25:32.114
If the BCR found out
I was alive, they'd kill me.

25:32.156 --> 25:33.783
The Kempeitai think
I collaborated,

25:33.824 --> 25:35.493
so they're hunting me.

25:35.534 --> 25:37.286
I can't go to my apartment,

25:37.328 --> 25:39.330
can't show my face
in my own shop.

25:41.540 --> 25:43.584
I have to clear my name.

25:43.626 --> 25:45.086
How?

25:45.127 --> 25:46.837
I'll go to Kido,

25:46.879 --> 25:49.090
and I'll explain what happened.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.175
Look, I was a victim, okay?

25:51.217 --> 25:53.344
-He'll see that I'm innocent.
-Childan-san.

25:53.386 --> 25:57.014
-No, I can explain to him.
-Your optimism is so American.

25:58.057 --> 26:00.059
What do you mean?

26:01.894 --> 26:04.480
When I was 14,

26:04.522 --> 26:07.525
a man came to our village
to collect the young girls.

26:07.566 --> 26:09.527
He told us

26:09.568 --> 26:13.364
we'd be nurses in the city
and work with the war effort.

26:13.406 --> 26:15.366
I was excited.

26:15.408 --> 26:17.368
I wanted to go,

26:17.410 --> 26:19.370
but my father knew
what he meant.

26:19.412 --> 26:21.372
They made the girls...

26:21.414 --> 26:23.416
(speaking Japanese)

26:25.668 --> 26:27.920
Prostitutes.

26:27.962 --> 26:29.964
My father took me
to the local authority--

26:30.006 --> 26:32.717
Sergeant Tanaka--
a man he trusted.

26:32.758 --> 26:35.553
Tanaka scared off the man
from the city,

26:35.594 --> 26:38.347
and I felt safe.

26:38.389 --> 26:42.268
And I'm working in the field,
and Tanaka came.

26:44.186 --> 26:46.188
He took me in the field.

26:47.982 --> 26:49.942
My face in the dirt.

26:49.984 --> 26:53.070
I told my father
what Tanaka had done to me.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.906
My father demanded
my honor be restored.

26:55.948 --> 26:57.450
Your father killed him?

26:57.491 --> 26:59.744
No, Robert.

26:59.785 --> 27:01.871
He made me marry him.

27:01.912 --> 27:04.874
My father shook Tanaka's hand
at the wedding,

27:04.915 --> 27:08.461
and I was married with the man
for 12 years.

27:08.502 --> 27:12.465
The day Tanaka died
was the day I was born.

27:13.507 --> 27:16.469
Never be ashamed of eating mice.

27:18.471 --> 27:20.431
We're survivors.

27:20.473 --> 27:23.267
We will outlive these men.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.269
(elevator bell dings)

27:25.311 --> 27:28.189
All their honor, all their
ribbons and medals are there

27:28.230 --> 27:30.649
to disguise
who they really are.

27:32.568 --> 27:34.653
But their crimes
are always revealed.

27:40.910 --> 27:44.246
Guard, halt.

27:44.288 --> 27:47.124
YAMORI:
In the name
of the Heavenly Sovereign,

27:47.166 --> 27:51.545
I convene
this military court-martial.

27:53.422 --> 27:55.633
SAITO:
This court-martial

27:55.674 --> 27:59.095
summons as witness
Chief Inspector Takeshi Kido.

28:07.395 --> 28:09.355
Tell us what happened
in the course

28:09.397 --> 28:11.440
of your surveillance
of the accused.

28:11.482 --> 28:14.693
My officers followed
Admiral Inokuchi

28:14.735 --> 28:18.489
to an abandoned sawmill
in a town outside of Moraga.

28:18.531 --> 28:22.034
There, I saw him meet
with Equiano Hampton.

28:22.076 --> 28:24.745
The terrorists responsible
for the gala auction massacre.

28:24.787 --> 28:27.164
Kido Taisa, I was present

28:27.206 --> 28:29.500
when the crown princess
asked you to find

28:29.542 --> 28:30.876
-Tagomi's murderers.
-SAITO: You are not

28:30.918 --> 28:32.545
to speak to the witness.

28:32.586 --> 28:34.088
What did you find, Taisa?

28:34.130 --> 28:35.673
Are you afraid

28:35.714 --> 28:37.800
to tell the truth?

28:42.721 --> 28:45.766
YAMORI:
I will allow
the admiral's question.

28:45.808 --> 28:47.268
Did you search

28:47.309 --> 28:50.771
for Minister Tagomi's murderers,
Chief Inspector?

28:50.813 --> 28:54.900
I conducted
a complete investigation, yes.

28:54.942 --> 28:56.610
SAITO:
And what individual

28:56.652 --> 28:58.737
did you determine
was Tagomi's killer?

29:01.532 --> 29:02.950
Say it, Taisa.

29:07.121 --> 29:08.956
Colonel Kido?

29:11.292 --> 29:12.877
Captain Iijima!

29:17.923 --> 29:20.259
It was Mingus Jones, sir.

29:20.301 --> 29:21.844
Whose testimony is this?!

29:21.886 --> 29:24.180
The evidence, Captain Iijima.

29:52.750 --> 29:54.126
(gunshots, glass breaking)

29:54.168 --> 29:56.253
SAITO:
Colonel Kido,

29:56.295 --> 30:01.634
there was a conspiracy to murder
Minister Tagomi, was there not?

30:03.636 --> 30:05.971
Yes.

30:06.013 --> 30:08.807
There was.

30:22.696 --> 30:24.698
What the fuck are you doing?

30:24.740 --> 30:26.951
A fine morning to you, too.

30:26.992 --> 30:28.994
I heard
you're heading to New York.

30:29.036 --> 30:30.412
I am.

30:30.454 --> 30:32.206
Well, D.C.'s gonna need
these weapons

30:32.248 --> 30:34.583
if we're ever gonna mount
an assault on the portal.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.210
D.C. can spare 'em.

30:36.252 --> 30:37.962
I shipped in enough
to go around.

30:38.003 --> 30:39.380
You're driving a bread truck

30:39.421 --> 30:41.715
with a cache of guns
into Manhattan?

30:41.757 --> 30:43.300
(sighs)

30:43.342 --> 30:44.969
Yes.

30:45.010 --> 30:47.680
Jesus Christ. What has
she talked you into?

30:47.721 --> 30:50.558
What are you doing, man?
You realize her plan is nuts.

30:50.599 --> 30:53.978
I earned my stripes!
Don't question my judgment!

31:08.200 --> 31:10.244
Fuck.

31:28.262 --> 31:30.222
Admiral Inokuchi,

31:30.264 --> 31:33.267
this court-martial finds you
guilty of high treason

31:33.309 --> 31:37.813
and conspiracy to murder
Trade Minister Nobusuke Tagomi.

31:44.403 --> 31:48.574
Admiral Inokuchi did not kill
Trade Minister Tagomi.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.868
He conspired
with Tagomi's murderers.

31:50.909 --> 31:53.704
We both know
who killed the trade minister,

31:53.746 --> 31:55.831
and it is not the BCR.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.542
Remember the cause you serve,
Taisa.

32:03.547 --> 32:06.884
Admiral Inokuchi,

32:06.925 --> 32:09.762
this military court-martial

32:09.803 --> 32:12.556
sentences you to death.

32:13.599 --> 32:15.100
SAITO:
We are prepared to offer you

32:15.142 --> 32:17.728
the courtesy of a firing squad.

32:17.770 --> 32:19.647
Chief Inspector...

32:21.106 --> 32:24.151
...the duty and honor
of rendering justice

32:24.193 --> 32:26.945
falls to you.

32:32.618 --> 32:35.287
Escort the prisoner
to the execution yard.

32:52.971 --> 32:55.307
Kido.

32:55.349 --> 32:57.059
Have you fallen this low?

33:10.072 --> 33:11.156
No!

33:14.243 --> 33:15.953
I will die with my eyes open.

33:19.707 --> 33:21.709
(engine turns off)

33:32.428 --> 33:34.430
(dog barking in distance)

33:39.768 --> 33:40.769
Riflemen!

33:41.895 --> 33:43.021
Ready!

33:47.151 --> 33:48.652
Load!

33:48.694 --> 33:50.070
(rifles clicking)

33:50.112 --> 33:52.030
Aim!

34:00.038 --> 34:01.081
Stop!

34:14.845 --> 34:16.221
General Yamori.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.933
I arrest you for the murder of
Minister Nobusuke Tagomi.

34:19.975 --> 34:21.894
Captain Iijima!

34:22.936 --> 34:24.104
-(gunshot)
-(groaning)

34:33.113 --> 34:34.448
Riflemen!

34:34.490 --> 34:35.949
About face.

34:38.827 --> 34:40.996
Take the General into custody.

34:43.540 --> 34:44.541
Do it.

34:46.168 --> 34:48.170
(shouts in Japanese)

34:53.091 --> 34:55.302
(Iijima groaning)

34:55.344 --> 34:59.348
You will not survive this, Kido.

35:01.391 --> 35:03.393
(handcuffs clacking)

35:07.606 --> 35:10.484
(gurgling, grunting)

35:12.694 --> 35:15.197
(door opens)

35:16.240 --> 35:17.950
(door closes)

35:17.991 --> 35:19.701
(exhales)

35:35.300 --> 35:37.302
(brakes squeaking)

35:39.471 --> 35:41.849
(engine turns off)

35:45.310 --> 35:47.729
(creaking)

35:55.487 --> 35:57.489
(latch clicks)

36:02.452 --> 36:04.454
Boom.

36:11.044 --> 36:13.338
This file holds the evidence

36:13.380 --> 36:17.342
that Captain Iijima was the man
who shot Trade Minister Tagomi.

36:17.384 --> 36:22.222
Iijima was working under
the orders of General Yamori.

36:24.224 --> 36:25.809
I am shocked.

36:27.895 --> 36:29.396
But I am not surprised.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.986
This occupation...

36:36.028 --> 36:39.072
has turned our people...

36:39.114 --> 36:40.782
against themselves.

36:46.079 --> 36:49.541
I understand your son

36:49.583 --> 36:52.002
served in Manchuria.

36:55.297 --> 36:58.133
Yes, Your Highness.

36:59.134 --> 37:01.511
I hope for a day

37:01.553 --> 37:06.183
we no longer need
to send our sons to war.

37:10.187 --> 37:12.105
I will see that this information

37:12.147 --> 37:15.233
is delivered
to the Emperor himself.

37:15.275 --> 37:18.111
There will be consequences.

37:19.321 --> 37:21.949
Chief Inspector,

37:21.990 --> 37:25.619
I know where
your political sympathies lie.

37:25.661 --> 37:30.499
My loyalties will always lie
with the emperor.

37:33.251 --> 37:34.836
(exhales)

37:34.878 --> 37:38.548
This must not have been easy.

37:39.883 --> 37:42.886
It was my duty.

37:45.097 --> 37:47.766
Nothing more.

37:51.269 --> 37:52.479
(elevator bell dings)

37:55.107 --> 37:57.025
Daddy.

38:01.279 --> 38:03.490
(exhales)

38:06.201 --> 38:08.370
It's good to see you.

38:08.412 --> 38:10.288
I have a surprise for you.
Close your eyes.

38:11.289 --> 38:12.916
Okay.

38:12.958 --> 38:15.127
(exhales sharply)

38:22.342 --> 38:24.261
Open them.

38:28.890 --> 38:30.267
It's wonderful.
Thank you.

38:30.308 --> 38:32.519
I told Mom you'd like it.

38:35.522 --> 38:37.441
Good night.

38:38.442 --> 38:40.444
Good night.

39:07.471 --> 39:09.639
Is everything all right?

39:09.681 --> 39:11.641
Yeah, of course.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.936
Did something happen
on your trip?

39:14.978 --> 39:16.897
No. Why?

39:18.774 --> 39:20.734
You seem...

39:20.776 --> 39:22.778
different.

39:24.780 --> 39:26.990
Do I?

39:27.991 --> 39:30.410
Uh...

39:35.624 --> 39:37.793
Well...
(exhales)

39:37.834 --> 39:39.544
I guess I've been, um...

39:39.586 --> 39:41.880
I've been missing the girls.

39:41.922 --> 39:44.216
And, uh...

39:44.257 --> 39:47.511
I've been thinking a lot
about you.

39:53.642 --> 39:57.229
Were you gonna tell me
about Martha?

39:58.230 --> 39:59.773
Who?

39:59.815 --> 40:02.734
The Staatspolizei agent.

40:03.735 --> 40:05.570
Ah.
(exhales)

40:05.612 --> 40:06.571
Okay.

40:06.613 --> 40:08.615
(grunts, chuckles)

40:09.783 --> 40:11.576
Listen, I...

40:11.618 --> 40:13.995
What can I say? I...

40:14.037 --> 40:16.414
I asked them to...
provide someone

40:16.456 --> 40:19.668
who wasn't gonna interfere
with your daily life...

40:19.709 --> 40:21.920
I'm under surveillance. That
interferes with my daily life.

40:21.962 --> 40:24.172
It's security, Helen.
I have bodyguards, too.

40:24.214 --> 40:25.715
Oh, come on.

40:25.757 --> 40:28.468
Let's at least be honest
with each other, John.

40:28.510 --> 40:31.138
Oh, you want me to be honest?
I don't like it either, Helen.

40:31.179 --> 40:34.057
But the fact is I-I don't know
that I can trust you

40:34.099 --> 40:36.309
-not to do anything rash again.
-I don't ask you

40:36.351 --> 40:38.645
where you go or who you're with.

40:38.687 --> 40:42.065
Even when you leave for
"Reich business" on a weekend

40:42.107 --> 40:44.901
and tell me
that you can't be reached.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.654
SMITH:
What's that supposed to mean?

40:47.696 --> 40:49.072
I can read you, John.

40:49.114 --> 40:51.700
I know
when something has happened.

40:54.536 --> 40:57.414
Helen...

40:57.455 --> 40:59.499
th...
(exhales)

40:59.541 --> 41:03.086
there's no one else.

41:03.128 --> 41:06.214
It's just you.

41:08.884 --> 41:10.760
We were apart for a year.

41:10.802 --> 41:13.096
I mean, I'm not a fool, John.

41:14.139 --> 41:15.599
That's different.

41:19.436 --> 41:21.479
(exhales)

41:21.521 --> 41:23.690
I don't object.

41:23.732 --> 41:25.609
It's been 20 years.

41:25.650 --> 41:27.652
We're both adults.
All I ask

41:27.694 --> 41:30.447
is you grant me the same measure
of privacy that I grant you.

41:30.488 --> 41:32.657
Listen, Helen...
(exhales)

41:32.699 --> 41:35.327
if you're not happy with Martha,

41:35.368 --> 41:37.078
then we can get her replaced.

41:37.120 --> 41:38.413
-But the fact...
-I don't want

41:38.455 --> 41:39.497
someone else.

41:39.539 --> 41:41.166
I don't want another guard.

41:41.208 --> 41:44.920
I want out of this fucking cell.

41:44.961 --> 41:47.422
How does it end?

41:47.464 --> 41:48.840
John, all of this.

41:48.882 --> 41:51.343
I mean, where does it end?

42:01.269 --> 42:03.647
(insects trilling)

42:09.277 --> 42:11.655
(creaking)

42:13.365 --> 42:16.743
You still racking your head
over that thing?

42:16.785 --> 42:18.245
Yeah.

42:18.286 --> 42:20.247
Getting close.

42:20.288 --> 42:24.251
Oh, yeah, uh,
Richie says he's got a...

42:24.292 --> 42:26.836
squat house for us in Harlem.

42:26.878 --> 42:29.464
The-the pornographer?

42:29.506 --> 42:31.967
Judge not.

42:32.008 --> 42:33.343
Look.

42:34.427 --> 42:37.055
Look.
"Rachel Chrisalms"

42:37.097 --> 42:38.890
-becomes "Reichsmarshall."
-Yeah.

42:38.932 --> 42:39.975
"Join me, your host"

42:40.016 --> 42:41.059
becomes "John Smith."

42:41.101 --> 42:42.894
"Patrol" becomes "portal."

42:42.936 --> 42:44.646
And then "bullet train."

42:44.688 --> 42:48.441
He's telling us Smith travels
to the portal by train.

42:48.483 --> 42:51.444
(laughs)

42:51.486 --> 42:53.989
The old bugger's torturing you.

42:54.030 --> 42:55.907
It's one-- yeah, you laugh.
It's one long string of code.

42:55.949 --> 42:58.660
By the time you crack it,
this war will be over.

42:58.702 --> 42:59.911
(sighs)

42:59.953 --> 43:02.497
Fuck. It's freezing in here.

43:02.539 --> 43:05.458
We getting close to the city?

43:10.547 --> 43:13.300
What is that?

43:14.592 --> 43:15.969
Pull over.

43:18.596 --> 43:21.016
(brakes squeak)

43:22.309 --> 43:23.685
(panting)

43:23.727 --> 43:25.520
(engine turns off)

43:25.562 --> 43:27.355
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, shit.

43:27.397 --> 43:29.733
That's right.
You weren't here.

43:30.900 --> 43:33.194
Where's the Statue of Liberty?

43:33.236 --> 43:35.864
They destroyed it.

43:35.905 --> 43:40.076
That is what they built
in its place.
