WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:03.804
(bell dings)
Oh, you're dead.

00:03.837 --> 00:06.040
JIMMY:
Over the years, my parents'
backyard had been home

00:06.074 --> 00:07.675
to rabid raccoons,
a hive of killer bees,

00:07.708 --> 00:09.677
and a chunk
of frozen blue airplane poop

00:09.710 --> 00:11.712
that cannonballed
into the hot tub.
(Barney screeches)

00:11.745 --> 00:14.748
All these were more pleasant
than what was going on here.

00:14.782 --> 00:17.551
It all started
because of a bad smell.

00:19.453 --> 00:21.755
(gasps) Oh.
Ooh.

00:21.789 --> 00:22.723
What is that?

00:22.756 --> 00:24.492
Ooh.
Is that us?

00:24.525 --> 00:25.493
(sniffs)

00:25.526 --> 00:26.994
You smell like fertilizer.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.762
Mm. You smell like
toilet bowl cleaner.

00:28.796 --> 00:29.763
Well, it's not us.

00:29.797 --> 00:31.165
(clears throat, blows)

00:31.199 --> 00:33.101
Oh.
Oh, I think I'm
getting warmer.

00:33.134 --> 00:35.736
(sniffs)

00:35.769 --> 00:37.438
Ooh, I also think
I found the smell.

00:37.471 --> 00:39.207
My eyes are tearing up,
look at that.

00:39.240 --> 00:40.174
(blows)

00:40.208 --> 00:41.442
(gags)

00:41.475 --> 00:43.677
(gasps) I think
it's got to be the rug.

00:43.711 --> 00:44.912
Or what's under the rug.

00:44.945 --> 00:46.114
Oh, wait.

00:46.147 --> 00:48.082
Are you sure you
want to do that?

00:48.116 --> 00:49.217
I gotta know, Virginia.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.751
I gotta know.

00:51.952 --> 00:53.721
Aah!
Aah! Ugh!

00:53.754 --> 00:55.389
Why did I
want to know?

00:55.423 --> 00:57.725
Oh.
Oh, why?
You can't unsmell that.

00:57.758 --> 00:58.759
Oh.

00:58.792 --> 01:01.962
* Whoo!

01:01.995 --> 01:06.534
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh, oh, oh *

01:06.567 --> 01:10.238
I was curing some
nice jerky under that rug.

01:10.271 --> 01:13.474
Well, let's clean it off, take
it outside for a couple of days.

01:13.507 --> 01:15.075
This is my house.

01:15.109 --> 01:17.978
No one's leaving me outside
for a couple of days.

01:18.011 --> 01:19.447
I'm talking about
the rug, Maw Maw.

01:19.480 --> 01:21.081
Just take it outside.
I hope it doesn't

01:21.115 --> 01:22.616
attract any more animals.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.485
More animals mean
more jerky.

01:24.518 --> 01:27.521
It's the circle of jerky.

01:29.089 --> 01:30.424
Hey, guys.

01:30.458 --> 01:31.592
Barney's freaking out about

01:31.625 --> 01:33.594
his first date
with Maxine.

01:33.627 --> 01:36.764
He's asking everybody to go
with him for moral support.

01:36.797 --> 01:38.232
But I'm a terrible wingman.

01:38.266 --> 01:41.869
Women can't resist
my potent sexual magnetism.

01:42.670 --> 01:43.771
Sabrina, eyes up here.

01:43.804 --> 01:45.506
Frank, your fly's open.

01:45.539 --> 01:47.575
Can't sell if you
don't advertise.

01:47.608 --> 01:48.776
What did you tell Barney?

01:48.809 --> 01:50.311
I just made up
an excuse.

01:50.344 --> 01:52.246
Told him I'm gonna
get a perm.

01:52.280 --> 01:53.814
Well, I think we should
support Barney.

01:53.847 --> 01:56.083
I'm not going. It's
not because of Barney.

01:56.116 --> 01:57.585
It's 'cause of
my Aunt Maxine.

01:57.618 --> 01:58.686
It's like
she's always

01:58.719 --> 01:59.687
criticizing
everything I eat

01:59.720 --> 02:01.322
and what I wear and...

02:01.355 --> 02:03.691
how I married a guy who's
just completely beneath...

02:03.724 --> 02:06.327
my wings.

02:06.360 --> 02:07.595
Like the wind.

02:07.628 --> 02:08.462
You can stop.

02:08.496 --> 02:09.863
Hey, Sabr...

02:09.897 --> 02:12.032
...immy. (chuckles)
You see what I did there?

02:12.065 --> 02:14.668
I combo'd your names because
you're my favorite couple.
Oh.

02:14.702 --> 02:17.004
How would you two like
to go on a double date...
Oh, we can't.

02:17.037 --> 02:18.606
We... have to go to our

02:18.639 --> 02:20.107
first fencing lesson.
Yeah, they're gonna

02:20.140 --> 02:22.643
teach us how to build a...
Fight with swords.

02:22.676 --> 02:26.347
Wow. Everyone I've asked
said they were busy tonight.
Huh.

02:26.380 --> 02:28.549
Never realized it would be
so hard to arrange a foursome.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.484
Is that how you're
phrasing it?

02:30.518 --> 02:33.020
Because I think
that's a problem.

02:33.053 --> 02:35.189
You know who would love
to go on a double date?

02:35.223 --> 02:36.390
My parents.

02:36.424 --> 02:37.958
And they're totally
free on Tuesdays

02:37.991 --> 02:39.493
because their favorite
TV show moved to Fridays.

02:39.527 --> 02:41.061
Great idea, guys.

02:43.364 --> 02:44.565
Bur...ginia.

02:44.598 --> 02:46.734
(chuckles) Did you
see what I did there?

02:46.767 --> 02:49.403
I combo'd your names because
you're my favorite couple.

02:49.437 --> 02:51.405
Oh.
Hey, I like that.

02:51.439 --> 02:52.740
And we'll call you Barn...

02:53.541 --> 02:55.709
...nobody. Sorry.

02:55.743 --> 02:56.810
Halfway into that,
I realized

02:56.844 --> 02:58.246
you don't have a girlfriend.

02:58.279 --> 03:00.013
While that's been true
since the mid-aughts,

03:00.047 --> 03:02.015
I am now currently
in a relationship with Maxine.

03:02.049 --> 03:04.485
Albeit long-distance
and mostly virtual.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.687
Good for you, Barney.

03:06.720 --> 03:07.921
Does Maxine know?

03:07.955 --> 03:09.757
Not only does she
know, but tonight

03:09.790 --> 03:11.325
is our first
in-person date.

03:11.359 --> 03:12.360
And I could
not be more...

03:12.393 --> 03:14.595
terrified.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.230
Would you two please come with?

03:17.298 --> 03:18.198
Dinner's on me.

03:18.232 --> 03:19.533
Well, sounds more fun

03:19.567 --> 03:20.934
than scraping the
dead meat smell

03:20.968 --> 03:21.935
out of our floor.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.337
Sure, we'd love to.

03:23.371 --> 03:25.606
Oh, thank God you'll be there.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.875
Because I tend to compensate
for awkward silences

03:27.908 --> 03:29.510
by stuffing bread in my mouth.

03:29.543 --> 03:30.711
(laughs)

03:30.744 --> 03:31.945
Yeah.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.427
Our reservation's at 7:00.

03:48.262 --> 03:49.630
Ooh.

03:49.663 --> 03:51.532
This place is so fancy.

03:51.565 --> 03:52.766
They give you free soup.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.934
It's lukewarm and
a little lemony,

03:53.967 --> 03:55.202
but it's free.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.370
That's for your fingers.

03:56.404 --> 03:58.138
Oh, so it's like
finger sandwiches,

03:58.171 --> 04:00.173
but with soup.

04:02.610 --> 04:04.278
I will never
understand the rich.

04:04.312 --> 04:05.979
Welcome to Prairie,

04:06.013 --> 04:07.415
Natesville's first
farm-to-table restaurant,

04:07.448 --> 04:09.082
where all of our meats...

04:09.116 --> 04:11.151
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we
get it, we know
all the animals

04:11.184 --> 04:12.620
had a great life
before they were

04:12.653 --> 04:14.588
brutally slaughtered, but we're
ready to order.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.657
So you don't want
to meet your chicken?

04:16.690 --> 04:18.225
No.

04:18.258 --> 04:19.927
But the lady will have him
roasted in mustard sauce

04:19.960 --> 04:22.129
with fingerling
potatoes.

04:22.162 --> 04:23.731
And my husband will have

04:23.764 --> 04:24.898
the pork shoulder

04:24.932 --> 04:26.634
with the roasted
red vegetables.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.569
That's exactly what I wanted,
but you forgot one thing.

04:28.602 --> 04:30.103
Oh, that's right.

04:30.137 --> 04:31.839
Even though my husband's
not having the lobster,

04:31.872 --> 04:33.841
he would like the bib.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.677
MAXINE:
And I will have...

04:36.710 --> 04:37.678
Ah, hey, hey, hey, hey.

04:37.711 --> 04:39.347
Allow me.
Oh.

04:39.380 --> 04:41.181
My lovely date
will have the veal.

04:41.214 --> 04:42.416
Mm.

04:42.450 --> 04:44.117
Chick...
Bzzt.

04:44.885 --> 04:46.186
Lobst...
Mm.

04:46.219 --> 04:47.488
Vealchicklobst.

04:47.521 --> 04:49.089
That sounds better
than turducken.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.324
That's okay,
Barney, I got it.

04:50.358 --> 04:52.025
And I will have
the bison steak.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.293
No gluten,
no trans fats,

04:53.327 --> 04:55.128
no dairy, no sugar,
no salt.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.997
I'll have all her
"nos" on the side.

04:57.030 --> 04:57.965
They sound delicious.

04:57.998 --> 04:59.367
And above all, no legumes.

04:59.400 --> 05:00.534
That's nuts.

05:00.568 --> 05:02.470
(whispers):
You said it, not me.

05:02.503 --> 05:04.938
JIMMY (in a Spanish accent):
Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya.

05:04.972 --> 05:08.108
You killed my father.
Prepare to die.

05:08.141 --> 05:09.610
SABRINA:
En garde.

05:09.643 --> 05:11.111
Parry, parry, thrust.

05:11.144 --> 05:12.680
My name isn't
Perry, you fool.

05:12.713 --> 05:14.815
Prepare to taste
my bendy sword.

05:14.848 --> 05:16.750
SABRINA:
(grunts) Ooh!

05:19.487 --> 05:21.789
We are so lame, aren't we?
What?

05:21.822 --> 05:23.957
What if, instead of just
picking up one of these flyers

05:23.991 --> 05:25.359
to show to Barney,

05:25.393 --> 05:27.395
we actually took
one of these classes ourselves?

05:27.428 --> 05:30.063
JIMMY:
It was then that I realized
narrating other people's

05:30.097 --> 05:32.199
activities was just
disguising the fact

05:32.232 --> 05:33.934
that we had none of our own.

05:35.869 --> 05:37.471
Mmm.

05:37.505 --> 05:39.707
I'm kind of upset
I didn't meet that chicken.

05:39.740 --> 05:41.642
I want to thank him
for being so delicious.

05:41.675 --> 05:43.744
This pig is pretty amazing, too.

05:43.777 --> 05:46.013
I'm kind of surprised they don't
eat each other more often.

05:46.046 --> 05:47.815
Mm.
If your shoulder
tasted this good,

05:47.848 --> 05:50.083
I'd have a hard time
stopping myself.

05:50.117 --> 05:51.819
Excuse me.
Yes, ma'am?

05:51.852 --> 05:54.154
Number one, I don't remember
ordering extra attitude.

05:54.187 --> 05:56.023
And number two, this steak

05:56.056 --> 05:59.292
is delicious, there's no way it
wasn't cooked with trans fats.

06:00.628 --> 06:01.662
Come on, Maxine.

06:01.695 --> 06:03.697
You sent it back three times.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.199
Maybe at this point what you're
tasting is the chef's saliva.

06:06.233 --> 06:08.536
Barney, it's a $60 steak,
just let me handle it.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.704
I was just trying
to defuse the situation.

06:10.738 --> 06:12.172
You don't have
to snap at me

06:12.205 --> 06:13.541
in front of my friends.

06:13.574 --> 06:15.242
That wasn't snapping,
this is snapping.

06:15.275 --> 06:16.877
BARNEY: Now why would
you do that?

06:16.910 --> 06:20.748
You know the art of snapping
has always eluded me.

06:20.781 --> 06:22.516
What are you gonna
throw in my face next?

06:22.550 --> 06:24.384
The fact that you can
fold your tongue or tiptoe?

06:24.418 --> 06:26.854
MAXINE (whispers):
Barney, we are
in a restaurant.

06:26.887 --> 06:28.822
I refuse to make a scene.

06:30.223 --> 06:33.126
I refuse
to make a scene!

06:36.263 --> 06:38.065
So...

06:38.098 --> 06:39.533
(clears throat)

06:39.567 --> 06:41.134
You really can't tiptoe?

06:41.168 --> 06:43.571
I was an obese child
raised by two lesbians

06:43.604 --> 06:45.105
who only wore sandals.

06:45.138 --> 06:47.508
I never stood a chance.

06:56.316 --> 06:58.118
(exhales)
I think it's working.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.087
I knew if we scraped hard
enough, we'd get the smell out.

07:00.120 --> 07:01.722
Let's hope this

07:01.755 --> 07:04.391
"Angel's Whisper" can help us
do the rest of the job.

07:04.424 --> 07:05.893
(sniffs)

07:05.926 --> 07:08.428
Mm. Guess that is what
that would smell like.

07:08.462 --> 07:09.429
Ow.

07:09.463 --> 07:11.632
Aah, I got
a splinter.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.833
I've got, like, ten of 'em.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.835
Ow.
Welcome to our new reality.

07:14.868 --> 07:16.336
Paradise from the ankles up.

07:16.369 --> 07:18.071
Oh, hello.

07:18.105 --> 07:20.407
Yes, I know it's the
middle of the night,

07:20.440 --> 07:22.510
I just really, really
need your help.

07:22.543 --> 07:24.411
I feel like a fool.

07:24.444 --> 07:27.247
I acted horribly rude
at the restaurant tonight.

07:27.280 --> 07:28.616
Like that time you barged
into someone's house

07:28.649 --> 07:30.417
in the middle of the night?

07:30.450 --> 07:34.021
Listen, I really like Barney,
and I do not want to lose him.

07:34.054 --> 07:36.123
I don't think he's gonna
find someone before morning.

07:36.156 --> 07:37.958
In fact, knowing Barney, you
probably have five to ten years

07:37.991 --> 07:40.193
to solve this problem.

07:40.227 --> 07:42.930
Well, I'm not the kind
of person to wait until the
morning to solve a problem.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.464
Well, we are.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.366
Sometimes we put things
off till the afternoon,

07:46.399 --> 07:48.335
or maybe three
months later.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.471
Look, I saw the way
you two were at dinner tonight.

07:51.505 --> 07:54.107
Ordering for each other,
so in sync.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.009
Can Barney and I
maybe just

07:56.043 --> 07:58.311
watch you
for a couple days just to...

07:58.345 --> 07:59.780
get a feeling for how you

07:59.813 --> 08:00.948
do what you do?

08:00.981 --> 08:02.983
I'll pay you. A lot.

08:03.016 --> 08:05.786
Oh, you think we're so
desperate for money
that we'll be used

08:05.819 --> 08:08.355
as guinea pigs in your
bizarre relationship experiment?

08:08.388 --> 08:10.658
Because if that's
what you think we are...

08:10.691 --> 08:12.726
the answer is yes.
Really?

08:12.760 --> 08:15.228
We need a new rug to cover
this splinter minefield

08:15.262 --> 08:17.865
on the floor. Besides, what's
the worst that could happen?

08:17.898 --> 08:20.033
That's just what comic strip
Cathy says every Monday,

08:20.067 --> 08:22.069
then, boom, she can't
fit into a bathing suit.

08:22.102 --> 08:23.571
Oh, come on, Burt.

08:23.604 --> 08:24.972
A new rug?

08:25.005 --> 08:26.373
I always hear people bragging

08:26.406 --> 08:28.341
about how their carpets
match their drapes.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.543
You're right.

08:29.577 --> 08:31.679
I want to be one
of those people.

08:36.083 --> 08:38.018
Good morning.
Good morning.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.988
Good morning.
And, full disclosure,

08:41.021 --> 08:42.590
I will be recording this

08:42.623 --> 08:44.825
for training purposes.
(beep)

08:44.858 --> 08:46.259
That is not a problem.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.829
I was just about to
whip up some breakfast.

08:48.862 --> 08:51.331
While I retrieve
the breakfast beverages.

08:51.364 --> 08:52.432
I'll miss you.

08:52.465 --> 08:55.102
I'll miss you more.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.574
VIRGINIA:
I hope everybody

09:00.608 --> 09:04.344
likes sticks and scones.

09:04.377 --> 09:06.747
Wait, you made those already?

09:06.780 --> 09:09.349
Well, we made the batter last
night before we went to bed.

09:09.382 --> 09:11.719
And we got up at 4:00
to put them in the oven.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.086
And then we
went back to bed

09:13.120 --> 09:14.922
for a couple more hours
of cuddling.

09:14.955 --> 09:16.089
VIRGINIA:
We always say,

09:16.123 --> 09:18.558
"Love is the most important part

09:18.592 --> 09:20.628
of a complete
and balanced breakfast."

09:20.661 --> 09:22.963
If you're not gonna be real,
this isn't gonna work.

09:22.996 --> 09:26.066
Exactly. Listen,
we don't need a show,

09:26.099 --> 09:29.036
we just need to see
how you really live.

09:29.069 --> 09:30.070
Ah, thank God.

09:30.103 --> 09:31.471
Come on out, Maw Maw.

09:33.140 --> 09:34.708
What's with
the spread?

09:34.742 --> 09:36.309
Is it Christmas already?

09:38.646 --> 09:42.015
I'll be in the bathroom
if anybody needs me.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.319
It's okay, she's got
a TV tray in there.

09:53.694 --> 09:55.963
Hut! (groans)

09:55.996 --> 09:59.166
Aren't you two taking your
Barney excuse a little far?

09:59.199 --> 10:01.902
Well, we actually went
to fencing lessons.

10:01.935 --> 10:05.005
Turns out our lying might have
led us to a real passion.

10:05.038 --> 10:07.074
I get to do my
lightsaber sound.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.777
(buzzes)

10:09.810 --> 10:11.244
And when he does that sound,

10:11.278 --> 10:12.612
I get to stab him
in the chest with a sword.

10:12.646 --> 10:15.515
I actually
really love my perm, too.

10:15.548 --> 10:19.019
I'm thinking about
keeping it forever.

10:19.052 --> 10:21.588
Oh, you're gonna
make your perm...

10:21.621 --> 10:23.023
What's that word
I'm looking for?

10:23.056 --> 10:24.925
Always there...

10:24.958 --> 10:26.326
not temporary...

10:26.359 --> 10:28.461
tenured...
Let's just give him
some space.

10:28.495 --> 10:29.963
...perpetual.
He'll get it.

10:29.997 --> 10:32.165
Infinite
in its sameness.
Okay.

10:32.199 --> 10:33.867
No.

10:33.901 --> 10:35.703
Enduring, forever,

10:35.736 --> 10:37.971
durable, persistent...

10:38.005 --> 10:39.707
(growling on TV)

10:39.740 --> 10:41.975
So, are you guys always about
three and a half inches apart

10:42.009 --> 10:43.510
when on the couch?
I guess.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.713
W-We kind of go where
the couch dip tells us.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.380
And, I'm sorry,
I-I was kind of caught up

10:47.414 --> 10:49.983
watching the lion eat
the baby meerkat, uh,

10:50.017 --> 10:51.551
but who initiated
the hand-holding?

10:51.584 --> 10:54.521
Uh...
Uh, we can't really
figure it out.

10:54.554 --> 10:56.223
It just kind of happens
on its own.

10:56.256 --> 10:58.058
Guys, please, we're
paying you for answers!

10:58.091 --> 10:59.526
Calm down,

10:59.559 --> 11:01.461
Maxine.
I'm sorry. I'm just frustrated

11:01.494 --> 11:03.797
because they agree on everything
and they never, ever fight.

11:03.831 --> 11:05.733
That's not true.
We used to fight.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.968
Yeah, we weren't
always perfect.

11:08.001 --> 11:10.537
All couples fight
in the beginning.

11:10.570 --> 11:11.805
You know
who saved us?

11:11.839 --> 11:13.173
You won't believe this,

11:13.206 --> 11:15.308
but it was that former
daytime talk show host

11:15.342 --> 11:16.844
Sally Jessy Raphael.

11:16.877 --> 11:20.413
Yeah. SJR says that couples
fight over three things:

11:20.447 --> 11:22.682
parenting, sex and being broke.

11:22.716 --> 11:25.018
We were like,
"Oh, my God, that's us.

11:25.052 --> 11:26.754
Can she see us
through the TV?"

11:26.787 --> 11:28.255
BURT: It's like she was
talking directly to us.

11:28.288 --> 11:30.423
Teaching us that if
a cross-dressing skinhead

11:30.457 --> 11:32.860
and a break-dancing rabbi
can stay married

11:32.893 --> 11:35.162
just by not fighting
over sex, parenting and money,

11:35.195 --> 11:36.496
then so could we.

11:36.529 --> 11:39.066
But those problems
aren't our problems.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.001
Yeah. Maxine makes
a good living

11:41.034 --> 11:43.170
and I haven't
bought groceries in 20 years.

11:43.203 --> 11:45.538
So cheddar isn't an issue,
money or cheese.

11:45.572 --> 11:48.008
And children probably aren't
in play because I sold

11:48.041 --> 11:49.509
most of my eggs years ago

11:49.542 --> 11:50.744
to pay
for business school.

11:50.778 --> 11:52.545
So that just leaves sex,

11:52.579 --> 11:55.715
which isn't a problem because
Barney refuses to make a move.

11:55.749 --> 11:57.584
BARNEY:
I'm sorry. I...

11:57.617 --> 11:59.219
I get nervous.

11:59.252 --> 12:01.755
Maybe it's because
of my ex-wife's pet name for me,

12:01.789 --> 12:04.391
"The Guy Who Can't
Give Me an Orgasm."

12:04.424 --> 12:08.128
One year, she even
put it on my birthday cake.

12:08.161 --> 12:10.230
Barney, would it help you

12:10.263 --> 12:13.200
if I sent you a cake
that said "Do Me Anytime"?

12:13.233 --> 12:15.335
Is that an invitation?

12:16.169 --> 12:18.772
Be gentle.
No.

12:18.806 --> 12:20.640
Judging from how Barney
shivered when she took his hand,

12:20.673 --> 12:21.975
this won't take too long.

12:22.009 --> 12:23.210
MAW MAW: Well, I just
got kicked out

12:23.243 --> 12:26.713
of a three-way
in my own bedroom.

12:26.746 --> 12:29.950
(sighs)
Big mistake.

12:29.983 --> 12:33.153
I'm a great utility player.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.589
Wow, these are, like, real rugs.

12:36.623 --> 12:38.658
These are a lot nicer
than the ones Jorge sells

12:38.691 --> 12:39.893
behind the gas station.

12:39.927 --> 12:41.428
Yeah, I don't think
he sells those.

12:41.461 --> 12:43.096
I think he's just showing off
how many rugs he has.

12:43.130 --> 12:45.298
You know, I think
this may be the first time

12:45.332 --> 12:47.667
we've actually bought
anything new for the house.

12:47.700 --> 12:50.637
Yeah. The stuff's either
Maw Maw's or hand-me-downs

12:50.670 --> 12:52.439
or "Hey, look,
they're throwing that out"s.

12:52.472 --> 12:54.407
It'll be so nice to have a rug
that doesn't glow

12:54.441 --> 12:56.509
like the Milky Way
under a black light.

12:57.477 --> 12:59.512
Burt, it'll be our special rug.

12:59.546 --> 13:00.747
And I see the perfect one.

13:00.780 --> 13:01.648
Me, too.

13:01.681 --> 13:03.884
That one.

13:08.856 --> 13:11.825
But this one is so luxurious.

13:11.859 --> 13:14.127
I could really see myself
reading

13:14.161 --> 13:16.363
in front of the fireplace
on this.

13:16.396 --> 13:17.965
I mean, if I read

13:17.998 --> 13:20.000
and our chimney wasn't
full of raccoons.

13:20.033 --> 13:22.169
Every time I look at it,
I'm gonna hear the word "shag"

13:22.202 --> 13:24.271
in my head,
and that's gonna urge me to do

13:24.304 --> 13:25.705
my Austin Powers impression

13:25.738 --> 13:27.274
(imitating Austin Powers):
every time, baby.

13:27.307 --> 13:28.275
Yeah!

13:28.308 --> 13:29.943
I hate when I do that.

13:29.977 --> 13:31.144
Look at this.

13:31.178 --> 13:33.546
Oriental rug.

13:33.580 --> 13:36.616
The correct term
is Asian-American rug.

13:36.649 --> 13:37.985
Besides, that pattern

13:38.018 --> 13:40.120
is busier
than a Chinese fire drill.

13:40.153 --> 13:41.688
I still like this one.

13:41.721 --> 13:44.224
But... I've heard orange
is the new black,

13:44.257 --> 13:46.826
but I definitely do
not want a black rug.

13:46.860 --> 13:48.695
I mean, African-American rug.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.464
Burt, we could carve pumpkins
on this rug,

13:51.498 --> 13:55.802
spill orange juice,
give each other spray tans.

13:55.835 --> 13:57.905
The possibilities are endless.

13:57.938 --> 14:00.073
Name one more thing.
You name one more thing.

14:00.107 --> 14:03.010
Well, I guess
we wouldn't have to worry

14:03.043 --> 14:05.478
if we touched it
with barbeque chip fingers.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.214
Or cheese puff fingers.

14:07.247 --> 14:09.182
Fine, the possibilities
are endless.

14:09.216 --> 14:10.683
But I still want that rug.

14:10.717 --> 14:12.685
Oh, my God.

14:12.719 --> 14:14.254
Are we fighting over a rug?

14:14.287 --> 14:15.688
There is no rug fight.

14:15.722 --> 14:17.524
So maybe this is
the money fight?

14:17.557 --> 14:19.059
No, the money fight
is when we're broke

14:19.092 --> 14:20.693
and can't afford
to buy anything.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.596
Maxine gave us plenty of cash,
so it can't be that.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.033
It can't be the sex fight after
what we did twice this morning.

14:26.066 --> 14:28.601
Well, that just leaves
the parenting fight.

14:28.635 --> 14:31.004
And as happy as it would
make me, I can't figure

14:31.038 --> 14:32.605
any way we can pin this
on Jimmy.

14:32.639 --> 14:34.841
I know. I had that thought, too,
and I got nothing.

14:34.874 --> 14:36.143
That means...

14:37.077 --> 14:38.378
(gasps)

14:38.411 --> 14:39.612
We've discovered
a fourth kind of fight.

14:39.646 --> 14:42.049
That bitch Sally Jessy
lied to us.

14:42.082 --> 14:43.350
Is it also possible that...

14:43.383 --> 14:45.552
baby mamas don't always
lead to drama?

14:45.585 --> 14:48.288
Uh... I don't know what
to believe anymore!

14:48.321 --> 14:50.357
Burt, we're not prepared
for another kind of fight.

14:50.390 --> 14:51.558
Let's just get out of here.

14:51.591 --> 14:52.559
(grunts)

14:54.094 --> 14:55.895
This is Clarence.

14:55.929 --> 14:58.098
Now, not only are you gonna be
eating him tonight,

14:58.131 --> 15:00.767
but the batter that we're gonna
fry him in is gonna be made

15:00.800 --> 15:03.270
with eggs
from his lifelong partner, Lucy.

15:03.303 --> 15:05.105
(gasps)
There they are.

15:05.138 --> 15:07.107
Natesville's
perfect couple.

15:07.140 --> 15:08.308
The love savers.

15:08.341 --> 15:10.043
Do you know that,
before you two,

15:10.077 --> 15:12.946
I always shied away from
public displays of affection,

15:12.980 --> 15:15.482
but now...

15:15.515 --> 15:16.984
Well... someone's

15:17.017 --> 15:19.386
not getting up to go
to the salad bar anytime soon.

15:19.419 --> 15:20.887
(chuckles)

15:20.920 --> 15:22.722
Ah. We're so happy
you could let us buy you dinner

15:22.755 --> 15:24.591
as a thank you
for all you've done for us.

15:24.624 --> 15:25.925
Sorry we're late.

15:25.959 --> 15:27.660
We were at the rug store.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.329
Oh, what kind of
rug did you buy?

15:29.362 --> 15:30.397
What's with the third degree?

15:30.430 --> 15:31.564
Jeepers, Burt.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.765
My queen just asked you
a question.

15:33.466 --> 15:34.401
Are you mad at us?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.902
I'm sorry.
It's not you,

15:35.935 --> 15:37.404
it's-it's us.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.571
Are you two fighting?

15:38.605 --> 15:39.406
You never fight.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.440
What's going on?

15:40.473 --> 15:42.542
Drugs? Infidelity?

15:43.376 --> 15:44.978
Banned German pornography?

15:45.012 --> 15:46.313
I'm just spitballing.

15:46.346 --> 15:48.248
We can't agree
on which rug to buy.

15:48.281 --> 15:51.351
Which is crazy 'cause we agree
on everything else in our lives,

15:51.384 --> 15:53.253
from which animals
go to Heaven...

15:53.286 --> 15:54.654
Dogs, cats, bigfoots, elephants.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.589
...to the best kind
of ice cream.
Bubble gum.

15:56.623 --> 15:58.825
Then why do you come in
every week and buy
a pint of chocolate?

15:58.858 --> 16:02.095
Hey. Whatever happened to
grocer-customer confidentiality?

16:02.129 --> 16:03.930
The Patriot Act
changed everything.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.665
Is this true, Burt?

16:05.698 --> 16:08.468
Are you really sneaking around
to buy chocolate ice cream?

16:08.501 --> 16:09.702
Maybe?

16:09.736 --> 16:11.304
See? This is what you get

16:11.338 --> 16:13.673
for listening to that
Sally Jessy Raphael.

16:13.706 --> 16:15.842
You never take
advice from someone

16:15.875 --> 16:18.945
with three names.
Lee Harvey Oswald,

16:18.978 --> 16:20.280
John Wayne Gacy,

16:20.313 --> 16:21.481
Mary Louise Parker--

16:21.514 --> 16:23.816
they're all notorious
psychopaths.

16:23.850 --> 16:25.818
She's right.
Of course I'm right.

16:25.852 --> 16:27.320
And there aren't just
three types of fights.

16:27.354 --> 16:29.456
There's millions,
and I think

16:29.489 --> 16:30.890
that you two have
been avoiding them.

16:30.923 --> 16:32.292
You know,
if you don't clear the air

16:32.325 --> 16:33.526
every once in a while,
stuff builds up

16:33.560 --> 16:34.794
until it explodes.

16:34.827 --> 16:35.862
Next thing you know,
you're crying

16:35.895 --> 16:36.896
in a bubble bath

16:36.929 --> 16:38.298
listening to Linda Ronstadt,

16:38.331 --> 16:40.033
trying to forget the image
of your cousin

16:40.067 --> 16:41.634
tongue-kissing your now ex-wife.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.070
That sounds awful.

16:43.103 --> 16:45.072
I don't want to listen
to Linda Ronstadt.

16:45.105 --> 16:46.873
I like Linda Ronstadt.

16:46.906 --> 16:50.710
She brings a sassy Latin flavor
to the adult contemporary genre.

16:50.743 --> 16:54.414
Oh, my God. We don't agree
on anything anymore.

16:54.447 --> 16:55.748
It's like fight dominoes.

16:55.782 --> 16:57.817
You two need a good,
healthy brawl.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.985
I think he's right, Burt.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.887
Me, too. I love you.

17:00.920 --> 17:02.789
I love you, too.

17:04.791 --> 17:07.094
This fight's off
to a terrible start.

17:07.127 --> 17:11.531
Okay, name-calling, screaming
and dish-throwing are allowed.

17:11.564 --> 17:13.933
Any reference to your opponent's
mother is considered a low blow

17:13.966 --> 17:15.702
and is encouraged.

17:15.735 --> 17:18.037
Yes. And, remember, you don't
have to be able to take it

17:18.071 --> 17:19.872
to dish it out.

17:21.574 --> 17:23.042
Hey! Guys!

17:23.076 --> 17:24.444
Barney just texted us

17:24.477 --> 17:26.179
and told us you were about
to have a fight.

17:26.213 --> 17:27.046
What's going on?

17:27.080 --> 17:28.181
You guys never fight.

17:28.215 --> 17:29.549
Apparently that's our problem.

17:29.582 --> 17:30.883
What's the fight
about? Is it me?

17:30.917 --> 17:32.352
Did I do something wrong?

17:32.385 --> 17:33.886
Jimmy, honey, you know
we would blame it on you

17:33.920 --> 17:35.122
if we could.

17:35.155 --> 17:36.689
Okay. Come on.
Let's get started.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.558
Uh...

17:39.459 --> 17:41.694
(sighs)

17:41.728 --> 17:42.729
(snorts)

17:42.762 --> 17:44.331
(snorts)

17:45.465 --> 17:47.200
We really don't know
how to start.

17:47.234 --> 17:49.902
Why don't you start with
something small, like, um...

17:49.936 --> 17:51.738
maybe he chews too loud.

17:51.771 --> 17:53.072
I like the way I chew.

17:53.106 --> 17:54.407
You said it made you

17:54.441 --> 17:56.042
feel safe to know
I was snacking nearby.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.110
I was lying.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.478
Okay?
I mean, I also said

17:58.511 --> 17:59.979
that I like those
silly little underwear

18:00.012 --> 18:01.614
that you wear
in our bedroom.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.151
They're my "manties," and
they make me feel virile.

18:04.184 --> 18:05.985
Let me tell you something,
mister-- the only part

18:06.018 --> 18:08.321
of a man's wardrobe
that should have satin

18:08.355 --> 18:11.324
is the lining
of his smoking jacket!

18:11.358 --> 18:14.093
Do you two mind? It's kind of
hard for Virginia and I

18:14.127 --> 18:15.995
to start a fight with all
this tension in the air.

18:16.028 --> 18:17.830
Please don't fight.
Mommy and Daddy love each other.

18:17.864 --> 18:19.399
Mommy and Daddy love each other.
Mommy and Daddy love each other.

18:19.432 --> 18:20.933
Hey, hey. hey. Don't turn away
from this, Jimmy.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.403
I'm telling you, it's totally
healthy for children to see

18:23.436 --> 18:25.272
that their parents
don't always agree.

18:25.305 --> 18:27.073
I know what you're getting at,
but I still refuse to fight

18:27.106 --> 18:28.141
in front of Hope.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.342
My parents fought in front of me

18:29.376 --> 18:31.278
all the time
and I turned out okay.

18:31.311 --> 18:33.980
You're a rich girl who
married into all this.

18:34.013 --> 18:35.248
Something went pretty wrong.

18:35.282 --> 18:36.816
All right.

18:36.849 --> 18:37.617
(growls)

18:37.650 --> 18:38.885
En garde!

18:40.487 --> 18:42.088
Hey.

18:42.121 --> 18:43.956
Which one of you's gonna pay me

18:43.990 --> 18:45.592
the $40 I spent on supplies?

18:45.625 --> 18:47.494
Don't anybody give him a nickel.

18:47.527 --> 18:49.296
I'm not paying for this!

18:50.463 --> 18:52.131
Now all the tufts of hair
on my body

18:52.165 --> 18:54.000
will look the same!

18:54.033 --> 18:55.202
That's the beauty of it!

18:55.235 --> 18:56.769
That's why you get a perm.

18:56.803 --> 18:57.637
(groans)

18:57.670 --> 18:58.805
Now give me my money!

18:58.838 --> 19:00.307
You want to talk about not sexy?

19:00.340 --> 19:02.542
How 'bout we start
with your O-face.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.581
Not sexy!

19:12.385 --> 19:14.354
JIMMY:
As my parents sneaked back into
the house, they couldn't help

19:14.387 --> 19:16.289
but think about Sally Jessy
Raphael as they watched

19:16.323 --> 19:18.458
the rest of us fight
about sex...

19:18.491 --> 19:19.892
Ooh, look at my ass
and my little...

19:19.926 --> 19:22.295
tiny little underwear.
I look like a child.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.396
...parenting...

19:23.430 --> 19:24.997
You really want Hope
to see this?

19:25.031 --> 19:27.133
Yep. It's gonna empower her
when I kick your ass.

19:27.166 --> 19:28.501
...and money.

19:28.535 --> 19:30.136
I'm sick of this!
I'm spending all day...

19:30.169 --> 19:32.339
(everyone arguing)

19:34.707 --> 19:36.209
I know how I look!
I look good!

19:36.243 --> 19:38.445
(speaking indistinctly)

19:39.846 --> 19:41.681
(groans)

19:41.714 --> 19:44.050
I don't want to fight.
Me neither.

19:44.083 --> 19:46.719
Good. Burt, if you want
chocolate ice cream,

19:46.753 --> 19:48.588
then just get chocolate
ice cream.

19:48.621 --> 19:50.223
You don't have to lie to me.

19:50.257 --> 19:52.892
I was only lying because,
while I like chocolate,

19:52.925 --> 19:56.329
I love watching you enjoy
bubble gum ice cream even more.

19:56.363 --> 19:57.364
You do?

19:57.397 --> 19:58.365
I think that's why I was

19:58.398 --> 19:59.566
so upset about the rug.

19:59.599 --> 20:01.768
What?
Seeing you happy makes me happy,

20:01.801 --> 20:03.670
so I give in on
a lot of things.

20:03.703 --> 20:06.105
I just thought this
time I'd pick something.

20:06.138 --> 20:09.676
I had no idea that the rug
was so important to you.

20:09.709 --> 20:11.378
We're never gonna be
world travelers.

20:11.411 --> 20:14.113
That rug made me feel
like I was actually

20:14.146 --> 20:16.616
on vacation in Asian America.

20:16.649 --> 20:17.784
Mmm.

20:17.817 --> 20:19.085
The rug you like makes me feel

20:19.118 --> 20:20.287
like I'm
in my parents' basement.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.488
Oh, my God.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.090
That's why I like it so much.

20:24.123 --> 20:27.460
Burt, do you remember
what we used to do on that rug

20:27.494 --> 20:29.128
when we were teenagers?

20:29.161 --> 20:31.298
* Take on me

20:31.331 --> 20:33.099
(both giggling)

20:33.132 --> 20:35.268
* Take on me *

20:35.302 --> 20:36.703
* Take me on...

20:36.736 --> 20:38.905
(giggling)

20:38.938 --> 20:40.573
We made some real sparks
on that rug.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.675
Yes, we did.
Now I totally want that rug.

20:43.943 --> 20:45.211
Oh, wait a minute.
We've got a whole yard

20:45.244 --> 20:46.646
full of people
out there fighting.

20:46.679 --> 20:49.215
(groans)
Should we tell
'em we made up?

20:49.248 --> 20:50.817
I have a better idea.

20:50.850 --> 20:52.251
(A-Ha's "Take on Me" playing)

20:52.285 --> 20:53.753
BURT: You want to take
it for a test drive?

20:53.786 --> 20:56.323
VIRGINIA:
I think that I do.

20:56.356 --> 20:59.792
* Take on me

20:59.826 --> 21:02.128
* Take on me *
(both chuckling)

21:02.161 --> 21:05.298
* I'll be gone

21:05.332 --> 21:07.233
* In a day...

21:07.266 --> 21:08.835
(zap)
(laughs)
(whoops)

21:08.868 --> 21:10.370
(both laughing)

21:12.138 --> 21:13.906
Let me know when
you two lovebirds are done

21:13.940 --> 21:15.508
with the rug.
If this tastes as good

21:15.542 --> 21:18.445
as it fights, this is gonna be
some great jerky.

21:18.478 --> 21:19.879
(growling, squeaking)

21:22.048 --> 21:23.282
(boat horn honks)

21:23.316 --> 21:25.151
MAN:
Everybody look busy.
