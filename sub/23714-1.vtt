01:23.625 --> 01:27.039
Hot, hot, hot! Ow, sun, sun.

01:55.949 --> 01:57.315
Oh, no.

02:16.928 --> 02:20.342
Okay, then. On your marks.

02:26.813 --> 02:31.854
<i>It's not unusual to be
loved by anyone</i>

02:32.235 --> 02:36.900
<i>It's not unusual to have
fun with anyone</i>

02:37.616 --> 02:41.656
<i>If you should ever want
to be loved by anyone</i>

02:42.788 --> 02:46.247
<i>It's not unusual to find
that I'm in love with you</i>

02:53.548 --> 02:54.629
<i>...pathetic.</i>

02:54.841 --> 02:56.548
<i>I'm just a bat, myself.</i>

03:11.108 --> 03:12.565
Stop it.

03:13.944 --> 03:18.029
I am the Prince of Darkness.
I do not do cuddly!

03:29.292 --> 03:33.286
...right there in front of everybody,
"Keep the car, it'll be worth it"...

03:35.132 --> 03:36.748
I'm sorry.

03:37.467 --> 03:41.302
No, not worth it to "ow".
Worth it to get rid of her.

03:43.849 --> 03:47.308
Quiet! What is that noise?
Do you hear that?

03:50.856 --> 03:52.313
Oh, it's me.
It's my pocket vibrating.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.446
<i>Hello?</i>

04:06.163 --> 04:07.529
Er, hello?

04:07.914 --> 04:10.531
Oh, hi. I want your teeth.

04:10.917 --> 04:13.330
<i>Excuse me?
- Your fake vampire teeth. You see...</i>

04:13.712 --> 04:17.296
<i>...I've been looking everywhere.
You are my last hope.</i>

04:17.673 --> 04:21.384
I can assure you, madam,
I may be getting on in years...

04:21.636 --> 04:24.128
...but my teeth
are very much my own.

04:24.473 --> 04:27.341
This is 'Vampires R Us'?
The costume store?

04:27.642 --> 04:30.476
This is Dracula.

04:32.314 --> 04:33.350
Who?

04:34.357 --> 04:37.691
Dracula.
The Prince of Darkness.

04:38.069 --> 04:42.359
No? The Bat Out Of Hell.
The Scourge of Transylvania.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.315
King of bats.

04:45.285 --> 04:48.278
Okay... Dracula.
I'm hanging up now.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.280
Stop! No, please don't hang up.
Please.

04:51.291 --> 04:53.203
Er, why not?

04:53.585 --> 04:54.826
It's...

04:55.212 --> 04:59.081
...it's just so nice to finally have
someone to talk to.

04:59.591 --> 05:02.880
Are you lonely?

05:03.595 --> 05:05.882
So, so very lonely.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.516
<i>Well, we could chat some more
if you want?</i>

05:10.936 --> 05:14.850
I would like that very much.

05:15.232 --> 05:20.478
What's your name,
fair maiden?

05:20.862 --> 05:22.945
Emma. Emma Wishbone.

05:23.323 --> 05:26.316
Well, Emma Wishbone, maybe...

05:27.202 --> 05:29.319
<i>...it was fate itself
that brought us together.</i>

05:31.498 --> 05:34.707
<i>Are you alright?
I'm sorry, that was lame.</i>

05:37.879 --> 05:40.997
<i>Hello? Hello, Emma?!
- Oh, come back!</i>

05:41.716 --> 05:45.426
<i>Hello? I can barely hear you.</i>

05:45.804 --> 05:49.639
Great. Now I get to buy a
new phone I can't afford.

05:50.016 --> 05:53.259
Off, you stupid thing!

06:06.491 --> 06:09.234
Emma Wishbone

06:10.579 --> 06:12.161
Renfield!

06:27.846 --> 06:31.965
Find me Emma Wishbone.
And I will make her my wife.

06:34.895 --> 06:38.184
And bring in my washing.
I think it's going to rain.

06:39.733 --> 06:42.100
Do you know what today is not,
Cheyenne?

06:42.235 --> 06:43.851
Your day?

06:44.446 --> 06:45.687
Precisely.

06:45.822 --> 06:48.815
Darling, you say that every day.

06:51.244 --> 06:56.456
Yes, but today, instead of calling a
costume store, I ended up talking to Dracula.

06:56.458 --> 06:59.075
And because of that,
my phone fell into the drain.

06:59.210 --> 07:00.872
Who did you speak to?

07:02.130 --> 07:03.837
Just some weirdo.

07:03.965 --> 07:05.456
Why do these things keep happening?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.673
Let me relax you with a massage.

07:16.811 --> 07:19.519
It's as if there's a curse
on this entire family.

07:19.606 --> 07:23.020
Max is having a hard time at school
and the shop is in decline.

07:23.151 --> 07:25.734
Max, show us your experiment.

07:26.112 --> 07:28.650
Fellow classmates, I present you -

07:29.074 --> 07:31.487
the Solar System.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.487
Our group of planets
orbit the magnificent Sun.

07:35.497 --> 07:38.956
It burns at
27 million degrees Fahrenheit.

07:39.334 --> 07:42.418
But one day, in around
five billion years time...

07:42.796 --> 07:45.584
...the Sun will start to cool
and the Earth will be plunged...

07:45.966 --> 07:47.502
...into a deadly ice age.

07:47.884 --> 07:51.468
The whole planet will be covered with ice.

07:52.263 --> 07:55.347
And all life will end.

07:55.684 --> 07:57.266
Any questions?

07:57.644 --> 08:01.103
Yeah. How do you wanna die?

08:01.481 --> 08:03.393
<i>My daughter Fay...</i>

08:03.775 --> 08:06.688
...desperately wants to be
a grown-up.

08:07.112 --> 08:08.694
<i>"I'm the only one for you"</i>

08:09.114 --> 08:13.700
<i>"Because I only love me
I only love me"</i>

08:13.868 --> 08:17.032
Fay, if you fancy this guy so much,
why not talk to him?

08:17.414 --> 08:19.406
He only goes for model material.

08:19.791 --> 08:24.001
<i>"I only love me on my own."
- That is just so cool. - Awesome.</i>

08:24.379 --> 08:26.245
Is it something new of yours?
- Yes...

08:26.631 --> 08:31.547
You're really pretty, Fay.
- Sure. Didn't you see my last magazine cover?

08:31.928 --> 08:35.217
Well then, see you tonight,
ladies.

08:35.597 --> 08:37.806
Oh, no, Sheila,
he's coming over here.

08:38.183 --> 08:41.347
So you smile then say 'Hi'.
- That's way too complicated.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.813
No, all you need is a push.

08:50.405 --> 08:53.989
Well that's one way of meeting.
What's your name?

08:57.579 --> 08:59.036
Er, Girdl.

08:59.414 --> 09:00.905
You're called Girdl?

09:03.418 --> 09:05.125
Flmm.

09:05.503 --> 09:07.039
Flmm?

09:08.465 --> 09:09.876
Flam.

09:10.258 --> 09:12.750
Okay, Flam.

09:14.137 --> 09:16.345
Do you feel like
getting off me now?

09:17.932 --> 09:21.391
- Oh, Fay.
- Yeah, sure.

09:29.152 --> 09:31.690
Earth to Fay.
- We're looking for...

09:31.905 --> 09:35.899
...some pretty girls for our new video.
And we're shooting it tonight.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.905
So?
- So, you're a pretty girl.

09:39.287 --> 09:42.371
I am?
- See you tonight.

09:43.208 --> 09:44.324
Flam.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.542
He thinks I'm pretty.

09:50.924 --> 09:55.464
Isn't that your brother over there?
- Brother? Who?

09:55.804 --> 09:57.591
Oi, get back here, you geek!

10:02.185 --> 10:05.519
<i>And Frank,
Frank is never home.</i>

10:16.783 --> 10:20.197
Wishbone, I want these
loan applications by tomorrow.

10:20.411 --> 10:23.825
But I wanted to be home on
time today to see my family.

10:24.249 --> 10:27.413
You love your family?
- Yeah, of course.

10:27.794 --> 10:30.582
Then avoid getting fired!

10:30.964 --> 10:34.253
Leaving them with absolutely
nothing to eat.

10:35.635 --> 10:38.548
What is that?
- Stress gives me wind.

10:45.228 --> 10:47.345
Sorry, guys.
- Come on, Frank!

10:47.730 --> 10:49.813
Smells like something crawled
inside you and died.

10:50.191 --> 10:53.935
And now I can't even find
vampire teeth for my costume.

10:56.781 --> 10:59.774
I just wanted us to do
something as a family again.

11:00.160 --> 11:03.528
We used to have so much fun.
Dressing up, going to parties.

11:03.872 --> 11:05.238
Look what I've found.

11:05.623 --> 11:07.956
Where did you get them?
- Charity shop.

11:08.334 --> 11:11.042
Used teeth.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.834
Just one careful owner.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.629
What's wrong?
- I just wish we had a party to go to.

11:18.011 --> 11:20.378
You mean like this?

11:20.763 --> 11:23.676
Monster Costume Party.
- Wow.

11:24.184 --> 11:26.471
Cheyenne, this is perfect!

11:26.853 --> 11:29.095
My family will love it!

11:31.065 --> 11:35.059
When was the last time
we did something fun together?

11:41.784 --> 11:43.901
Don't know, don't care.

11:44.287 --> 11:47.280
One year, nine months
and 23 days ago.

11:47.665 --> 11:49.406
So we've got some
catching up to do.

11:49.792 --> 11:53.160
I've got to get ready for my date.
And I need to catch up on cold fusion.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.333
I've got work to do.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.583
But I've already made
the costumes, see?

12:01.262 --> 12:04.050
<i>My baby don't care for rings</i>

12:04.432 --> 12:07.220
<i>Or other expensive things</i>

12:07.602 --> 12:09.468
<i>My babyjust cares...</i>

12:09.854 --> 12:11.390
<i>for me</i>

12:14.108 --> 12:17.317
<i>My babyjust cares for me</i>

12:18.446 --> 12:23.908
My dear old friend, what would you say
if I offered you your freedom?

12:24.035 --> 12:24.821
Release me?

12:25.036 --> 12:27.744
If you can still perform
your transformation spell.

12:27.914 --> 12:29.450
I can.

12:34.295 --> 12:36.912
My amulet.

12:38.967 --> 12:42.131
By fire, by light,
by all things bright!

12:55.400 --> 12:57.107
Here, prove it on this.

13:17.755 --> 13:21.840
Don't we look great?

13:22.218 --> 13:25.211
Mum, you're really embarrassing.

13:26.097 --> 13:27.554
No matter...

13:27.932 --> 13:30.800
No matter what I do,
you think I'm embarrassing.

13:31.019 --> 13:35.138
When I put on make-up, I'm embarrassing.
When I don't, I'm embarrassing.

13:35.523 --> 13:39.733
When I wear a miniskirt, I'm embarrassing.
- No, then you're not embarrassing.

13:40.153 --> 13:40.984
I'm not?

13:41.195 --> 13:42.686
You're just really sad.

13:42.780 --> 13:46.444
Well I think mum is beautiful.
- Don't be so scared all the time.

13:46.617 --> 13:47.403
I'm not scared.

13:47.618 --> 13:50.235
If you stood up for yourself,
you wouldn't get beaten up.

13:50.413 --> 13:51.995
Are you being bullied at school?

13:52.165 --> 13:53.952
I'd rather be a suck-up
than fail my exams.

13:54.167 --> 13:55.954
You're failing your exams?

13:56.336 --> 13:57.702
Don't hit your brother!

13:58.046 --> 14:00.629
Fay!
- You didn't say anything about kicking.

14:00.882 --> 14:04.216
Violence is the last refuge of the incompetent.
- Dictionary mouth.

14:04.594 --> 14:07.302
Frank, can you say something?!
- What? Something.

14:07.555 --> 14:09.421
Well you did ask, Mum.

14:09.557 --> 14:11.970
Don't you get smart, Max.
- Too late.

14:12.352 --> 14:13.593
Frank!

14:13.978 --> 14:18.598
You will transform
this woman into a vampire.

14:18.983 --> 14:22.602
But, Dracula, you are.

14:22.987 --> 14:26.901
Why not simply bite her yourself?

14:27.283 --> 14:31.152
If I bite her,
she will lose her soul.

14:31.537 --> 14:35.156
And her soul is exquisite.

14:35.541 --> 14:38.750
Difficult spell this is,
on humans.

14:39.087 --> 14:42.956
Will only work
if the person is unhappy.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.759
Wow, a red carpet.

14:52.100 --> 14:54.888
This really looks like
my kind of party.

14:55.269 --> 14:58.012
- There you are.
- Hi.

14:58.398 --> 15:01.641
We're here for the party.
- Yeah, I know, dear. Follow me.

15:02.026 --> 15:03.938
This way
- Okay.

15:05.488 --> 15:07.275
I have them.
- Wow...

15:07.657 --> 15:10.741
...we're really getting the VIP treatment.

15:11.119 --> 15:14.578
Good job, Mum.
- Didn't I tell you it would be fun?

15:17.417 --> 15:20.251
Let's rock.

15:20.628 --> 15:23.541
And where exactly is here?

15:26.259 --> 15:29.343
What sort of party is this?

15:30.138 --> 15:32.130
Oh, and why are we on a stage?

15:32.515 --> 15:36.384
Why are we the only ones
wearing costumes?

15:37.228 --> 15:39.595
They think we're the band.

15:43.484 --> 15:46.147
Okay, then, we can do this.

15:47.071 --> 15:53.568
Silent night, Holy night,

15:53.953 --> 15:56.445
All is...

16:08.551 --> 16:10.417
Imposters!

16:11.429 --> 16:16.345
I have a feeling that Emma is
very, very unhappy.

16:16.976 --> 16:19.935
Then enchant her, I can.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.770
Excellent.

16:26.777 --> 16:29.269
And fix this before you go.

16:32.074 --> 16:33.690
Hm? Ach.

16:37.288 --> 16:40.201
I need a holiday.

16:45.213 --> 16:49.127
Well that was less than ideal.
- Why don't you talk like a regular person?

16:49.509 --> 16:51.466
Can't you just be nice to
your brother?

16:51.844 --> 16:54.552
It's the last thing
I feel like doing.

16:55.223 --> 16:58.432
I'm sorry.
- That was totally humiliating,

16:58.809 --> 17:01.847
and it's all your fault.
- It was an accident.

17:02.230 --> 17:05.598
No-one wanted to come on your
stupid family outing.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.895
Well I wanted to study.

17:08.236 --> 17:10.603
You are so ungrateful.

17:10.988 --> 17:13.526
Hey, come on,
don't shout at the kids.

17:13.907 --> 17:15.773
Finally, he wakes up!

17:16.160 --> 17:18.903
Can you to drive us home
before you fall asleep again?

17:19.247 --> 17:22.866
Yeah. I'm just working so hard.
- And I'm not?!

17:23.251 --> 17:27.415
Well, I wouldn't exactly call
making these costumes 'hard work'.

17:29.966 --> 17:32.504
I hate that my daughter
does nothing but insult me.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.468
And I hate that my kids
are always fighting.

17:35.846 --> 17:39.385
And I hate that my husband
just sleeps through it all.

17:43.354 --> 17:47.394
Work it will, my transformation spell.

17:52.113 --> 17:54.480
So very unhappy, you are.

17:54.865 --> 17:57.733
Perceptive, you are.

17:58.119 --> 18:00.031
Help, Baba Yaga will.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.656
Really? How?
- By cursing you.

18:04.041 --> 18:05.828
What? Sorry?

18:06.210 --> 18:10.295
By fire, by light,
by all things bright.

18:10.673 --> 18:12.710
Yeah. Now, dear, don't
you have a cat somewhere...

18:13.092 --> 18:15.675
...that needs feeding?

18:15.970 --> 18:17.256
Or something?

18:26.022 --> 18:28.605
Great, now it's gonna be raining.

18:28.983 --> 18:31.976
By day, by night...

18:32.320 --> 18:35.063
I really think we're witnessing
actual magic.

18:35.448 --> 18:38.316
That's impossible.
- Do you have another explanation?

18:38.701 --> 18:40.317
Not really.

18:48.836 --> 18:51.499
You will be transformed tonight!

19:06.896 --> 19:09.309
Why won't they come off?

19:09.690 --> 19:12.979
Hold on, I'll help you.

19:19.700 --> 19:20.986
Get off!

19:22.536 --> 19:26.155
Not the nicest way to treat
your brother.

19:26.540 --> 19:27.951
Max?

19:32.171 --> 19:33.582
I'm hairy.

19:33.756 --> 19:35.588
All over.

19:44.684 --> 19:46.346
Dad?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.351
Oh, that's dad.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.653
What have you done
to my family?

19:58.030 --> 20:01.319
Opala. Actually, I only wanted
to transform you.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.738
If everyone is transformed,

20:04.120 --> 20:06.203
then everyone must be unhappy.

20:06.580 --> 20:10.290
I'm transformed?
- See for yourself.

20:14.255 --> 20:16.372
I'm an ugly old witch!

20:16.757 --> 20:19.420
No, that's me.

20:19.802 --> 20:21.794
You've now become
a reflectionless vampire.

20:22.179 --> 20:25.297
I'm a, I'm a vampire?

20:25.683 --> 20:26.719
Yes.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.512
Disappear, pronto!

20:31.897 --> 20:33.934
Where did she go?

20:40.740 --> 20:42.572
Some time, this might take.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.532
Come back here.

20:45.453 --> 20:48.537
Disappear, pronto!

20:49.749 --> 20:53.333
Curse it.
Amulet not fully charged.

20:53.711 --> 20:57.921
Okay, Emma, last year
you went to the gym...

20:58.299 --> 20:59.460
...twice!

21:02.762 --> 21:05.846
Wow, it really paid off.

21:08.684 --> 21:10.926
I'm coming,
you old witch!

21:11.312 --> 21:13.725
Baba Yaga, you won't catch.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.893
Oh, really? How do you know?

21:16.275 --> 21:18.813
In tea leaves,
I have read.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.029
Must have been a typo.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.122
He-he, capture yourself, you have.

21:36.504 --> 21:40.874
Just practising for when
I catch you.

22:04.907 --> 22:07.445
Out of way!

22:14.750 --> 22:16.707
Move, stupid birds!

22:22.424 --> 22:24.962
Watch your step!

22:37.022 --> 22:39.935
Who leaves their laundry out this late?

22:43.195 --> 22:45.107
Disappear, pronto!

22:58.586 --> 23:02.000
We really need to talk flossing.

23:02.381 --> 23:03.872
Get back here!

23:29.366 --> 23:30.607
Disappear, pronto!

23:39.793 --> 23:41.284
Disappear, pronto!

23:46.258 --> 23:48.500
Unhappy woman
not giving up.

24:00.940 --> 24:05.059
So how's that disappearing spell
working for you?

24:05.444 --> 24:09.609
Big, big power needed
for big, big magic.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.573
Amulet must recharge at place
of great spiritual energy.

24:12.952 --> 24:17.071
Oh, great. We'll come with you and
you can transform us back.

24:17.456 --> 24:19.163
Sorry, sweetie.

24:19.541 --> 24:22.955
Alone I travel
...to Oculus Londra

24:23.337 --> 24:25.124
Ocula what?

24:27.758 --> 24:29.795
Oculus Londra.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.299
Not only is this not my day...

24:37.685 --> 24:39.893
...it is also not my night.

24:52.658 --> 24:54.695
Not Londra, this is.

24:55.577 --> 24:59.116
Never working,
this piece of rubbish.

24:59.498 --> 25:03.333
Useless, you are.
Still long way to travel.

25:12.177 --> 25:13.668
Where are the kids?

25:14.096 --> 25:17.180
Uffta.

25:17.558 --> 25:19.345
What?
- Uffta.

25:19.727 --> 25:23.562
Frank, you still know who I am,
don't you?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.977
Uffta.
No, I'm Emma.

25:27.359 --> 25:30.693
Memma?
- Yes. Your wife.

25:31.697 --> 25:33.154
Uffta?

25:37.286 --> 25:41.405
Good to see that something
hasn't changed.

25:43.125 --> 25:47.540
I think I might be in with a
real chance here. Mustn't blow it.

25:48.005 --> 25:50.418
Renfield!
Go and pack my things...

25:50.758 --> 25:54.422
...I'm going to meet my future bride.

25:56.764 --> 25:59.006
Very funny.

26:01.769 --> 26:04.557
He passes Kobe Bryant...

26:04.938 --> 26:09.774
...leaves LeBron James in the dust.
And he scores! Yeah!

26:22.039 --> 26:23.325
Don't eat me.

26:23.707 --> 26:26.541
I've just had chilli
I'll go right through you.

26:27.336 --> 26:29.919
Help me!

26:30.297 --> 26:32.755
Not so nice being scared, is it?

26:33.133 --> 26:35.125
You, you can speak?

26:35.511 --> 26:38.049
Nothing gets past you, genius.

26:38.931 --> 26:42.766
No. No, my trousers...

26:42.976 --> 26:44.512
No...

27:01.161 --> 27:04.495
It's me, Fay.

27:06.542 --> 27:10.377
Who?
- Flamm?

27:11.380 --> 27:13.542
That costume really isn't the look
we're going for...

27:13.924 --> 27:17.668
...in the music video.
- It's not a costume.

27:18.053 --> 27:19.589
I'm a mummy.

27:19.972 --> 27:22.464
Some crazy witch has cursed
my whole family.

27:22.850 --> 27:26.594
Okay, someone's had way too
much Halloween candy.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.854
Here, touch me.
See for yourself.

27:30.274 --> 27:32.231
Wow, that's so...

27:32.609 --> 27:34.942
You're so... mouldy.

27:35.320 --> 27:36.856
You've got to help me.

27:37.239 --> 27:40.823
You know I would but
I've got like a ton of homework.

27:41.827 --> 27:43.944
You think I'm disgusting,
don't you?

27:44.329 --> 27:46.446
No. You're great.

27:46.832 --> 27:50.576
You're the best looking decaying corpse
I've ever seen.

27:52.671 --> 27:56.085
Yeah, well, you're not
so hot either.

28:00.637 --> 28:01.673
Fay?

28:03.223 --> 28:04.259
Max?!

28:05.100 --> 28:08.184
Are you here?

28:08.562 --> 28:11.521
Careful. Watch, watch your...

28:14.693 --> 28:18.312
...head.
- Moobid ming.

28:18.697 --> 28:21.906
You really don't wanna break that,
it was a present from your mother.

28:22.284 --> 28:24.992
I always thought it was ugly anyway.

28:25.370 --> 28:28.488
Mum? Dad? Is that you?

28:33.462 --> 28:35.499
Mummy!

28:35.881 --> 28:38.999
Oh, Max.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.805
Okay, that's new.

29:02.574 --> 29:03.940
Fay, are you okay...

29:04.326 --> 29:06.488
...sweetie?
Don't you dare "sweetie" me.

29:06.870 --> 29:10.489
This is all your fault!
- What?

29:10.874 --> 29:15.414
If you hadn't made us wear these stupid
costumes, we wouldn't be in this mess.

29:18.966 --> 29:22.175
Look, we're gonna find the witch...

29:22.552 --> 29:26.262
...and I'll make her change us back.
I promise.

29:26.640 --> 29:29.849
And how are you gonna do that?
Look her up online?

29:30.227 --> 29:33.311
She said she was going to somewhere
called Oculus Londra.

29:33.689 --> 29:36.602
Ocula whatnow?
- Yes, that's just what I said.

29:36.984 --> 29:39.317
Oculus Londra means
London Eye.

29:39.695 --> 29:41.152
That's a big Ferris Wheel in London.

29:41.697 --> 29:43.780
So the witch wants to go
on a Ferris Wheel?

29:44.157 --> 29:48.367
I've read at school that the London Eye is
built on an ancient magical site.

29:48.745 --> 29:52.659
The witch must be going there to
recharge her powers.

29:53.000 --> 29:54.787
So we're going to London?

29:55.168 --> 29:57.000
Moliday.

30:04.303 --> 30:07.717
Oh, this is no way Londra.

30:08.098 --> 30:11.182
Disappear, pronto!

30:13.312 --> 30:17.727
That is some serious
spiritual reshaping.

30:18.066 --> 30:19.432
Tell me about it.

30:19.693 --> 30:21.980
I just coughed up
a fur ball.

30:22.321 --> 30:25.029
Thanks for taking us to the airport, Cheyenne.
- No problem.

30:25.407 --> 30:29.947
Life is a journey and I like
to travel in style.

30:30.329 --> 30:33.913
I'm really glad
dogs are colour blind.

30:34.291 --> 30:37.159
<i>Five, four, three...</i>

30:37.544 --> 30:40.207
This is not Londra.

30:40.589 --> 30:42.876
Disappear, pronto!

30:46.345 --> 30:49.258
Fay, we will find the witch,
I promise

30:49.639 --> 30:51.972
It's not just that.

30:52.351 --> 30:55.389
Finally a boy thought
I was pretty and now...

30:55.771 --> 30:59.390
...he can't even look at me.
- Beauty doesn't last.

30:59.775 --> 31:02.939
It doesn't matter what anyone
else thinks, Fay.

31:03.320 --> 31:06.063
You have to know yourself
how special you are.

31:08.200 --> 31:10.658
You don't need other people
to tell you.

31:11.036 --> 31:13.995
I remember feeling like that.
Never mind.

31:14.373 --> 31:17.537
I'm gonna get you there.
Here we go!

31:33.809 --> 31:35.175
Mind out!

31:43.402 --> 31:45.815
Off we go.
- No, stop.

31:46.696 --> 31:49.564
What are you doing?
- You can't go out there.

31:49.950 --> 31:53.364
It's daylight.
- So? - You're a vampire.

31:53.745 --> 31:57.580
You'll burn up.
- But I've got to get on that plane.

31:57.958 --> 32:01.998
Well, there are legends
that say vampires with souls...

32:02.379 --> 32:05.372
...might be able to survive
contact with the sun.

32:05.757 --> 32:07.623
Well, great. Let's go.

32:08.009 --> 32:10.797
But they're only legends.
Who knows if they're true?

32:11.138 --> 32:13.596
Well, I guess there's only
one way to find out.

32:13.974 --> 32:17.843
No, Mum, don't!

32:29.948 --> 32:31.064
Oh...

32:32.033 --> 32:35.492
Well, I guess that answers
that question.

32:35.871 --> 32:41.538
Thank you, magnificent sun, for not
burning my dear friend to a crisp.

32:44.838 --> 32:47.501
Mum? What if I said I might
not want to be changed back?

32:47.883 --> 32:52.127
I like people being scared of me.
- Oh, darling, I know what you mean.

32:52.512 --> 32:57.553
Are you nuts? I look like a 3,000 year
old meatloaf and dad is a...

32:57.684 --> 32:59.175
...gigantic farting idiot!

32:59.436 --> 33:03.976
Okay, that's not so new.
- Fay!

33:04.357 --> 33:06.815
I'm just saying, if you two
back out now...

33:07.194 --> 33:10.358
...it's totally unfair!

33:10.739 --> 33:13.698
Nobody is backing out.

33:13.992 --> 33:17.156
Max, right now you think it's great that
people are scared of you.

33:17.537 --> 33:22.157
But scary people are lonely because
nobody wants to be around them.

33:22.542 --> 33:25.831
Which fortune cookie did you read that in?
- Quiet, Fay.

33:26.213 --> 33:28.500
Everyone act naturally.

33:30.133 --> 33:31.840
How can I...

33:32.219 --> 33:35.178
...be of assistance?
- Go on.

33:35.555 --> 33:38.138
Hello.
Five tickets to London, please.

33:38.850 --> 33:41.137
Actually, that's four people
and a dog.

33:41.520 --> 33:45.013
He travels everywhere with us.
This little one is part of the family.

33:45.857 --> 33:48.816
Isn't that right, Buster?

33:49.027 --> 33:50.734
Of course.

33:51.905 --> 33:56.024
And why is Mr Wishbone two feet
taller than stated here?

33:56.409 --> 33:59.117
Growth hormones. In the meat.

33:59.496 --> 34:03.240
Don't you watch the news?
- And what's going on...

34:03.625 --> 34:05.742
...with your daughter?

34:06.127 --> 34:09.916
Acne. Puberty, you know.
Very severe case.

34:12.007 --> 34:15.797
And what about you?
- Me? Oh, yes,

34:16.179 --> 34:18.512
I've been performing in
"Dracula, the Musical" in London.

34:18.889 --> 34:22.634
I thought I'd get into costume now
and save time.

34:23.018 --> 34:25.226
Very impressive.
The dog will definitely have to travel...

34:25.438 --> 34:27.100
...in the hold with the luggage.

34:27.399 --> 34:29.231
Do you have a cage for it?

34:29.442 --> 34:31.228
Mum, I don't want to
travel with the luggage.

34:31.360 --> 34:35.571
Don't worry, Max.
I mean Buster.

34:40.829 --> 34:44.288
That was me.
I'm a ventriloquist.

34:44.708 --> 34:48.668
Hello there, madam,
I'm a dog. Give me a biscuit, please.

34:50.380 --> 34:53.839
If you could just bear with me
for one second.

34:55.552 --> 34:58.295
Security, we've got
a bit of a problem.

34:58.722 --> 35:01.760
I can't look like this
for the rest of my life.

35:01.933 --> 35:04.016
We have to get to London,
find the witch...

35:04.394 --> 35:06.852
...so that she can make us
human again.

35:07.063 --> 35:10.227
You have to let us on that plane.
You have to.

35:12.319 --> 35:15.153
<i>Hello?</i>

35:15.530 --> 35:19.649
No problem. And I'll upgrade you
to First Class.

35:21.786 --> 35:25.700
Here you go, your tickets.
- Thank you.

35:27.751 --> 35:30.118
Let's go, Frank.

35:30.503 --> 35:31.960
Have a good flight.

35:32.339 --> 35:35.002
Didn't I tell you that
everything would be fine?

35:35.342 --> 35:39.177
I have no idea what just happened
- You can hypnotise people.

35:39.554 --> 35:42.342
It's just like in. 'The Curse Of The Mummy'.
- Really?

35:42.766 --> 35:45.884
Mummy,
I need a bigger allowance.

35:46.269 --> 35:49.057
Don't even think about it,
young lady.

35:49.439 --> 35:53.683
I would try that with dad.

35:58.114 --> 35:59.571
Look, girls...

35:59.949 --> 36:02.783
...that's what happens when
you over-exfoliate.

36:10.168 --> 36:12.535
You are all big stupid monkeys.

36:18.385 --> 36:20.923
And she has got a banana.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.640
Fay!

36:31.022 --> 36:34.561
Mum, if I have to look like this...

36:34.943 --> 36:38.152
...at least let me have some fun.

36:44.285 --> 36:46.527
Mocolate.

36:46.913 --> 36:48.825
Chocolate for everyone!

36:50.333 --> 36:52.245
Fay, stop this immediately.

36:52.627 --> 36:57.418
Come on, Mum, this is much better
than an in-flight movie.

37:03.388 --> 37:05.505
What's wrong?
- I'm just...

37:05.890 --> 37:10.260
...I'm just so hungry.

37:11.146 --> 37:14.264
So eat this.
- No.

37:17.235 --> 37:19.352
How about tomato juice?

37:35.003 --> 37:37.711
Okay. Who are you
and what's going on?

37:38.006 --> 37:40.248
Does the name...

37:40.633 --> 37:43.046
..."The Prince Of Darkness"...

37:43.428 --> 37:46.762
...ring any bells?

37:47.140 --> 37:50.599
I, well...
I am Dracula.

37:50.977 --> 37:55.267
Dracula?
How did you get on this plane?

37:55.648 --> 37:59.358
I could not wait to meet you,
my thorny rose.

38:01.446 --> 38:03.938
And now, my dear,
to the matter in hand.

38:04.324 --> 38:06.782
Well, in your hands,
actually.

38:07.368 --> 38:10.111
Drinking the blood of humans
is such a messy affair...

38:10.497 --> 38:12.989
...and considered quite common
these days.

38:13.374 --> 38:16.958
Not to mention the matter of
disposing of the leftovers.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.212
Leftovers?
- Come with me.

38:20.590 --> 38:22.832
Come with you?
- To where you belong.

38:23.218 --> 38:27.053
To my castle.
- But... but I, I...

38:27.430 --> 38:31.800
I can't leave my
family behind.

38:32.185 --> 38:35.349
Would you rather stay and drain these
people of their life-force...

38:35.730 --> 38:39.474
...in order to quench your
insatiable thirst?

38:40.735 --> 38:43.853
No.

38:45.698 --> 38:49.692
I'll come with you.
- I hoped you might.

39:01.548 --> 39:04.666
This place is not being Londra either.
Disappear, pronto!

39:10.640 --> 39:13.974
Forgive the mask, I'm not overly
fond of the sun.

39:14.352 --> 39:18.221
I know, how about
a parachute?

39:19.566 --> 39:21.853
Parachutes
are for wimps.

39:37.417 --> 39:40.205
Just out of interest,
where are we flying?

39:40.879 --> 39:43.838
Towards our future together.

39:54.475 --> 39:57.809
Call me pampered but...

39:59.689 --> 40:01.806
...I like to travel in style.

40:05.361 --> 40:07.569
Memma?

40:07.739 --> 40:11.699
She was right here.
- Where's she gone?

40:21.127 --> 40:23.460
Hey, give me that.

40:23.630 --> 40:26.873
Come on. Jump.
You can do it if you try.

40:30.011 --> 40:31.798
That's gonna be handy.

40:32.764 --> 40:36.178
A little jest.
Only I can do that.

40:40.563 --> 40:44.022
This is a bit sudden, don't you think?

40:44.400 --> 40:46.357
Your lunch.

40:48.738 --> 40:50.855
What on earth is this?

40:51.658 --> 40:54.651
I want blood, not a pill.

40:55.036 --> 40:59.451
Trust me, Emma.
- But how can I trust you? You're Dracula.

40:59.832 --> 41:02.119
That's why only I know what you need.

41:11.260 --> 41:13.297
Yes, it's an acquired taste.

41:16.891 --> 41:18.757
It's working.

41:19.477 --> 41:22.015
I'm changing back.

41:22.397 --> 41:25.060
Why are you helping me?

41:25.441 --> 41:27.808
You're the first person
in a thousand years...

41:28.194 --> 41:31.687
...who has lifted my melancholy.
- That's so sad.

41:32.115 --> 41:34.323
No, because you have
been worth the wait.

41:34.701 --> 41:37.910
Finally there's someone who can
understand me and share my life.

41:38.287 --> 41:40.495
Romantically.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.956
A vampire wife.

41:45.712 --> 41:49.331
Wait, did you send that
witch after us?

41:52.552 --> 41:58.093
Witch? No, I don't know any witches.
Do they even really exist?

41:58.474 --> 42:00.636
I want to get back
to my family.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.811
Do they really make you happy?

42:05.982 --> 42:09.726
Well... sometimes.

42:10.153 --> 42:13.567
"Sometimes" is nowhere near enough
for you, my darling.

42:13.948 --> 42:16.691
You deserve to be happy "always".

42:17.368 --> 42:19.655
I will devote myself to...

42:20.038 --> 42:23.657
...showing you a life beyond
your wildest dreams.

42:29.714 --> 42:33.583
Our home would be
my castle.

42:39.182 --> 42:41.219
<i>But we will travel...</i>

42:41.934 --> 42:44.927
<i>...to the most romantic places.</i>

43:10.338 --> 43:12.921
<i>I will give you this world...</i>

43:14.258 --> 43:17.251
<i>...and worlds beyond.</i>

43:51.212 --> 43:54.205
It could be wonderful.

43:55.424 --> 43:58.838
Can your husband offer you anything
like that?

43:59.220 --> 44:04.090
We did play Scrabble on a Tuesday night
last May for no particular reason.

44:04.475 --> 44:08.845
Then what are you waiting for,
my love? Follow your heart to me.

44:09.272 --> 44:11.309
Oh. I...

44:11.983 --> 44:14.270
...I have to get back to my family.

44:18.573 --> 44:21.691
You would choose
to be unhappy?

44:22.076 --> 44:26.286
No. But when you're a mother,
you have to take the good with the bad.

44:26.664 --> 44:29.247
Well if you're that sure,
don't let me keep you.

44:29.959 --> 44:33.202
You could have just called me a cab!

44:38.426 --> 44:42.591
If mum doesn't show up here...
- ...we might never see her again.

44:42.972 --> 44:46.636
Emma will be fine, guys.
Relax.

44:47.018 --> 44:51.558
Tai chi with me. I call this one...

44:51.898 --> 44:55.062
'Chicken Flies Into The Soup'

44:58.696 --> 44:59.982
Mum?

45:00.448 --> 45:01.814
Memma.

45:02.909 --> 45:05.151
Coming!

45:05.536 --> 45:08.449
Mummy!
I really need to practise that.

45:08.831 --> 45:10.868
You're back!
- We thought we'd never see you again.

45:11.250 --> 45:13.913
I'm fine. It's okay.

45:14.295 --> 45:16.878
Memma. Memma. Memma.

45:17.298 --> 45:20.211
Gently, gently, gently.

45:22.094 --> 45:25.212
So what's with the disappearing act?

45:25.598 --> 45:27.681
Did you ever think of
calling your family?

45:28.059 --> 45:30.676
Yes, we were really worried.
Where have you been?

45:31.062 --> 45:33.930
It wasn't that easy.
Dracula has a way...

45:34.357 --> 45:38.397
...of hypnotising you.
- Dracula, the vampire?

45:38.778 --> 45:41.236
No, Dracula, the hair stylist.

45:41.614 --> 45:44.607
So, is he handsome?
Like in the films?

45:44.951 --> 45:46.567
Mammsome?

45:47.161 --> 45:49.824
He's kind of looking for love.

45:50.206 --> 45:51.663
Mmove?

45:55.711 --> 45:57.794
Renfield!

45:58.172 --> 46:01.461
Prepare Operation Ice Age.

46:01.842 --> 46:06.337
If I can't have love,
then no-one can.

46:06.722 --> 46:09.931
I will eliminate all
life on Earth.

46:10.309 --> 46:12.517
Oh and tell Baba Yaga...

46:12.895 --> 46:16.138
...I have something
particularly nasty planned for her...

46:16.524 --> 46:20.768
...if she doesn't destroy
this 'happy family'...

46:21.153 --> 46:23.361
...immediately!

46:26.784 --> 46:29.401
This not Londra.

46:30.997 --> 46:31.987
Hi.

46:34.375 --> 46:37.413
Disappear, pronto!

46:42.925 --> 46:45.838
Mig Men.

46:46.679 --> 46:47.795
Big Ben.

46:48.389 --> 46:51.006
Mig Men.

46:51.392 --> 46:54.385
It's the witch.

46:54.770 --> 46:57.604
Oculus wrong again.
- Get her!

46:57.982 --> 47:01.020
This is Londra.

47:02.194 --> 47:04.231
There's no way I'm jumping
in after her.

47:04.613 --> 47:06.855
Of course not,
scaredy-cat.

47:07.241 --> 47:11.531
Oh, could you please stop arguing
just for once.

47:16.000 --> 47:18.162
Oh, no, not this
crazy magic again.

47:18.919 --> 47:21.787
What is she doing?
Is she going to change us back?

47:35.061 --> 47:36.643
It's about time.
Let's go.

47:37.021 --> 47:39.183
Change us back
so we can fly home.

47:39.565 --> 47:43.309
No, do I will not.
Fully charged, my amulet is.

47:43.694 --> 47:46.277
Now finish my task,
I can.

47:46.655 --> 47:50.365
So Baba Yaga free can be,
at last.

47:57.208 --> 47:58.415
No.

48:02.213 --> 48:04.751
Stay here,
you little piece of...

48:08.427 --> 48:11.420
Enough, messed up my work,
you have.

48:11.806 --> 48:17.222
By air, by sky.
Now you will fly...

48:17.603 --> 48:20.095
...to Egypt!

48:21.190 --> 48:24.024
Curse it again, all of them I've hit.
- No...,

48:24.402 --> 48:26.268
...not all of them.

48:38.082 --> 48:41.041
So who thinks the evil witch
just tricked us?

48:41.419 --> 48:44.583
That would probably explain why
we're now in Egypt.

48:44.964 --> 48:47.126
This is not a problem.

48:47.550 --> 48:51.419
We are getting out of this desert and
finding that witch.

48:51.804 --> 48:54.012
And how do you think
we should do that?

48:54.390 --> 48:57.724
I haven't worked that out yet
but, come on...

48:58.060 --> 49:00.973
...we're a family.
We can do anything.

49:01.355 --> 49:05.975
Follow me! We're getting out
of this desert.

49:11.740 --> 49:14.448
Bring back my friend.
- Never.

49:14.827 --> 49:18.662
You run fast
for an old crone.

49:19.915 --> 49:21.622
Disappear, pronto!

49:23.169 --> 49:25.377
Not cool.

49:31.635 --> 49:33.547
My amulet.

49:42.313 --> 49:43.349
Got it!

49:50.488 --> 49:53.105
Hold on.

49:55.826 --> 49:59.536
Take my hand!
- Trust you, why should I?

50:02.041 --> 50:05.159
Because I'm one of
the good guys.

52:07.458 --> 52:10.542
Imprison me, Dracula did,
for a thousand years.

52:10.919 --> 52:14.629
The more I hear about that guy,
the less I like him.

52:15.007 --> 52:18.000
And then freedom,
he promised me,

52:18.344 --> 52:20.176
if I did his evil bidding.
- So now...

52:20.554 --> 52:23.718
...will you turn the
Wishbones back?

52:24.099 --> 52:26.261
Do that, only they
themselves can.

52:26.644 --> 52:28.681
Really? But how?

52:29.063 --> 52:31.646
Only when happy they are...

52:32.024 --> 52:35.233
...human they
will become again.

52:35.611 --> 52:38.069
Well, I guess they'd
better get used...

52:38.489 --> 52:40.776
...to being monsters.

52:43.452 --> 52:44.613
Renfield!

52:48.707 --> 52:50.539
The fate of the world...

52:50.918 --> 52:53.331
...rests in my hand.

52:53.712 --> 52:56.170
The innocent snowflake...

52:56.548 --> 52:59.382
...engineered into
a deadly weapon.

52:59.760 --> 53:01.797
Behold what this tiny flake...

53:02.179 --> 53:05.263
...alone can achieve.

53:28.122 --> 53:30.614
Now imagine billions
of these flakes...

53:30.999 --> 53:33.833
...pressed together into
an icy sphere.

53:34.211 --> 53:37.420
With that I will destroy
the Sun itself.

53:37.840 --> 53:41.550
And the Earth will be plunged
into a deadly ice age.

53:55.858 --> 53:56.974
Mum?

53:57.693 --> 54:01.186
Mummy! I found footprints.

54:01.572 --> 54:02.688
Footprints?

54:03.073 --> 54:06.737
Well, we just have to follow them
and we're saved.

54:07.119 --> 54:09.361
- Uffta.
- Uffta.

54:09.747 --> 54:11.079
Mummy...

54:11.457 --> 54:14.666
- Yes?
- These are our own footprints.

54:15.043 --> 54:17.581
Oh...

54:17.963 --> 54:20.000
Mhat?
- Everything will be okay.

54:20.466 --> 54:22.298
How? Look around.

54:22.676 --> 54:25.384
We're in a giant,
enormous sandpit!

54:25.763 --> 54:28.096
You're making it sound
as if this is my fault.

54:28.474 --> 54:32.639
Well, you are the one who gave the
amulet back to the evil witch.

54:33.020 --> 54:35.683
Everything always has to be your way...

54:36.148 --> 54:38.105
...and we just have to deal with it.

54:39.485 --> 54:42.023
You don't actually think I'm good
at anything, do you?

54:42.404 --> 54:46.239
No. Well you're great at making us look
hideous and completely monstrous.

54:46.450 --> 54:49.113
You know how to ruin our lives
better than anyone.

54:49.495 --> 54:53.159
And I'm gonna be smelly
and ugly for ever!

54:53.499 --> 54:55.912
Why can't I have a daughter
who is nice...

54:56.293 --> 54:58.376
...who doesn't beat up her brother
who doesn't flunk school...

54:58.754 --> 55:01.622
...and who doesn't make me feel
like an actual monster?!

55:06.720 --> 55:09.053
I'm so very sorry, sweetie.

55:09.723 --> 55:13.808
Then maybe you should find another daughter.
- Fay. Come back!

55:14.770 --> 55:18.263
I'm counting to three.
One, two...

55:18.649 --> 55:20.185
three...

55:21.360 --> 55:23.101
87...

55:23.487 --> 55:25.103
88...

55:25.489 --> 55:26.445
89...

55:26.865 --> 55:29.232
I don't think she's coming back.

55:29.993 --> 55:32.827
Max, I'm sorry, but that really
doesn't help at all.

55:34.915 --> 55:38.499
Oh, great. Fay's not here
so you're yelling at me.

55:39.253 --> 55:41.540
I'm through with this family.

55:41.922 --> 55:45.165
I'm a lone wolf now.

55:47.010 --> 55:49.969
Max, I'm counting to three.

55:50.973 --> 55:52.214
One...

55:52.558 --> 55:53.765
two...

55:56.186 --> 55:58.303
741...

55:58.689 --> 56:01.056
742...

56:01.441 --> 56:04.184
Oh...

56:04.570 --> 56:07.779
Why is it whenever I need
you most, you stand there and...

56:08.156 --> 56:11.194
...don't say a word?!
- Uffta?

56:11.577 --> 56:15.742
Well it's too late to start now.
- Uffta?

56:16.123 --> 56:19.116
I can't deal with this any more!

56:19.501 --> 56:21.538
Just go away! Move!

56:36.602 --> 56:38.093
Uffta.

56:39.187 --> 56:40.928
Memma.

56:43.358 --> 56:46.567
We're better off apart.

56:51.992 --> 56:54.780
Emma has left her family.

56:55.162 --> 56:58.781
I might have just been given
a second chance.

56:59.166 --> 57:02.250
I'm going to fly
back to my Emma!

57:02.628 --> 57:05.541
Renfield,
pause Operation Ice Age.

57:36.078 --> 57:38.866
Oh, I'm so hungry.

57:41.833 --> 57:43.369
I need blood.

57:48.131 --> 57:51.340
Dinner time.

58:03.563 --> 58:07.398
And just when you think things
can't get any weirder...

58:07.776 --> 58:10.359
You are trespassing in my desert.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.608
...you meet a talking whirlwind.

58:19.204 --> 58:21.662
Nobody enters my...

58:23.834 --> 58:26.918
Welcome to Egypt...

58:27.295 --> 58:28.957
...beautiful creature.

58:34.428 --> 58:36.511
Here it's hot.

58:37.472 --> 58:39.555
Finally some shade.

58:50.027 --> 58:54.021
Cut it out.
I don't need a haircut.

59:03.749 --> 59:06.992
No-one messes
with Weremax!

59:16.511 --> 59:18.002
Melp.

59:21.099 --> 59:22.715
Melp.

59:30.442 --> 59:33.685
Whose great idea was it
to have a...,

59:34.071 --> 59:38.315
...fashion photo shoot
in the desert?

59:53.799 --> 59:55.335
Girls.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:00.344
I say.

01:00:12.275 --> 01:00:18.317
<i>Come a little closer, honey
Come to me</i>

01:00:23.078 --> 01:00:25.946
Whoa!

01:00:27.332 --> 01:00:30.996
Gosh,
you surely startled us.

01:00:31.378 --> 01:00:34.542
What are you doing out
here all alone?

01:00:35.924 --> 01:00:38.837
Are you alright, dear?
You look a little pale.

01:00:39.261 --> 01:00:41.628
And you look delicious.

01:01:00.657 --> 01:01:04.867
My darling needs me and
here I am.

01:01:05.245 --> 01:01:06.986
May I?

01:01:27.058 --> 01:01:30.347
Oh, my, what a man.

01:01:30.353 --> 01:01:36.395
<i>Come a little closer, honey
Come to me</i>

01:01:43.742 --> 01:01:46.075
am Pharaoh Imhotep.

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:50.121
You're Johnny Depp?
- Im-ho-tep!

01:01:50.498 --> 01:01:52.490
Oh, okay, great and sandy one.

01:01:56.796 --> 01:01:59.163
You are very beautiful.

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:03.376
Me? - I have lived
for more than 3,000 years...

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:09.053
...and in all that time I have
met no-one as beautiful as you.

01:02:10.810 --> 01:02:15.271
Come, let me show you
the true power of the mummy.

01:02:19.611 --> 01:02:23.480
You, too, can do this.

01:02:24.491 --> 01:02:29.657
Yeah.
You simply have to wish it.

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:34.665
So nice.
- Uffta!

01:03:07.492 --> 01:03:10.610
Welcome home.

01:03:12.872 --> 01:03:15.956
Wow. Are you sure
you've got enough room?

01:03:20.297 --> 01:03:22.505
Would you give me
the honour...?

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.719
Hold tight!

01:04:16.353 --> 01:04:19.061
Stay with me, Emma
and make me the happiest...

01:04:19.481 --> 01:04:22.815
...immortal plasma-dependent
fiend on Earth.

01:04:37.874 --> 01:04:40.582
Hey, anything on four legs
stays on a lead!

01:04:40.877 --> 01:04:43.415
Who's on four legs?

01:04:54.099 --> 01:04:57.513
Hi.

01:04:57.894 --> 01:04:59.931
It's okay,
I won't hurt you.

01:05:02.565 --> 01:05:06.104
<i>Scary people are lonely because
nobody wants to be around them.</i>

01:05:09.322 --> 01:05:12.781
Wow, this is amazing!

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:39.930
Welcome to my home.

01:05:40.311 --> 01:05:41.768
For thousands of years...

01:05:42.147 --> 01:05:45.060
...I have waited for a woman
like you.

01:05:45.442 --> 01:05:47.729
One who is special.

01:05:48.111 --> 01:05:51.695
One whose beauty shines brighter...

01:05:52.073 --> 01:05:53.735
...than the sun.

01:05:55.702 --> 01:05:59.070
One with whom I can...
conquer the world.

01:05:59.456 --> 01:06:01.869
Er, conquer the world?

01:06:04.627 --> 01:06:08.337
<i>I'm a lazy boy
I watch the sun shine</i>

01:06:08.631 --> 01:06:11.339
<i>Lighting up
the peerless peaceful sea</i>

01:06:14.179 --> 01:06:15.920
Moliday!

01:06:19.142 --> 01:06:21.179
Ladies.

01:06:24.564 --> 01:06:26.556
Uffta?

01:06:26.858 --> 01:06:29.191
I'll take it from here, girls.

01:06:35.492 --> 01:06:39.202
You're certainly taking your time
to decide, my love.

01:06:39.579 --> 01:06:42.196
That's going to hurt
in the morning.

01:06:44.417 --> 01:06:47.876
So, darling,
will you be mine?

01:06:51.466 --> 01:06:55.426
They're better off without me.
I accept.

01:06:59.349 --> 01:07:02.217
Then I am more happy than
any man living or dead

01:07:02.602 --> 01:07:05.219
...has reason to be. Renfield!

01:07:07.857 --> 01:07:11.225
Show my fiancÃ©e to her chamber.

01:07:11.611 --> 01:07:13.648
And prepare my Lazarus bath.

01:07:14.030 --> 01:07:16.943
I think I'm starting to
sag a little.

01:07:17.325 --> 01:07:21.035
Now that we have finally
found each other...

01:07:21.412 --> 01:07:24.905
...we have the immense power
to rule the world like gods.

01:07:25.250 --> 01:07:28.368
No-one will disobey
our commands.

01:07:28.753 --> 01:07:32.667
And all will worship your divine,
immeasurable beauty.

01:07:33.049 --> 01:07:34.836
I don't think so.

01:07:35.218 --> 01:07:37.426
Do not contradict me.

01:07:37.804 --> 01:07:41.764
Will if I want to. No way you can force me.
- Oh, yes, I can.

01:07:42.141 --> 01:07:45.634
Oh, you sound exactly
like my mother.

01:07:53.528 --> 01:07:56.066
You still have much to learn.

01:07:57.073 --> 01:08:01.238
Education is not really
my thing. So bye.

01:08:18.011 --> 01:08:20.048
This is mine?

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.598
Renfield is such a chatterbox.

01:08:41.701 --> 01:08:44.444
What a mattress!

01:09:20.907 --> 01:09:23.149
Why was I always so strict?

01:09:27.830 --> 01:09:30.537
<i>I'm a lazy boy
I watch the sun shine</i>

01:09:31.042 --> 01:09:33.910
<i>Lighting up
the peerless peaceful sea</i>

01:09:36.339 --> 01:09:37.546
More.

01:09:38.758 --> 01:09:40.545
Help!

01:09:41.260 --> 01:09:42.376
Melp?

01:09:42.804 --> 01:09:45.341
Meow.

01:09:45.723 --> 01:09:47.339
Dad.

01:09:52.689 --> 01:09:55.102
I think you might need

01:09:55.400 --> 01:09:57.392
a little mirror time.

01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:00.982
I, I, I can't...

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:02.904
...I can't
be seen like...

01:10:03.324 --> 01:10:05.782
...this.

01:10:09.205 --> 01:10:11.697
<i>Beauty doesn't last.</i>

01:10:19.257 --> 01:10:22.546
Now that I've found you,
I will not let you go.

01:10:22.927 --> 01:10:25.635
I'm not going to let you take
over the world.

01:10:26.013 --> 01:10:29.632
You must come with me.
Who else will accept you...

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:32.259
...looking like you do?

01:10:32.729 --> 01:10:35.096
<i>It doesn't matter what anyone
else thinks, Fay.</i>

01:10:36.274 --> 01:10:38.857
It doesn't matter what
I look like.

01:10:39.235 --> 01:10:41.943
It matters
who I am inside.

01:10:42.321 --> 01:10:44.654
If you will not come
with me willingly...

01:10:45.032 --> 01:10:46.989
...I will force you.

01:10:50.621 --> 01:10:51.657
Ow!

01:10:52.039 --> 01:10:54.656
Leave my sister alone.

01:10:57.086 --> 01:10:58.577
Die!

01:11:03.926 --> 01:11:06.543
Hm?

01:11:20.109 --> 01:11:23.568
Thanks for trying to save me.
That was really brave.

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:28.281
You're welcome. And we really need to
talk about your choice of boyfriend.

01:11:30.912 --> 01:11:33.370
Uffta. Mash.

01:11:39.879 --> 01:11:42.417
Okay, he is way scarier
than I am.

01:11:52.391 --> 01:11:55.725
Mash! Immommebb.

01:12:36.936 --> 01:12:39.724
You know I only have cucumbers
in my bath!

01:12:40.106 --> 01:12:43.850
Although drowned bats are
a welcome addition.

01:12:50.116 --> 01:12:51.573
You!

01:12:51.951 --> 01:12:53.988
Be cool.

01:12:54.370 --> 01:12:56.953
She's on our side.
- What?

01:12:57.331 --> 01:13:02.122
True, it is.
- I've fallen for your lies far too many times.

01:13:02.503 --> 01:13:07.248
We can trust her. She brought
me here to you, didn't she?

01:13:07.592 --> 01:13:10.380
Well...
that's true.

01:13:10.761 --> 01:13:13.424
Dracula forced her to put
the spell on you.

01:13:13.806 --> 01:13:16.514
She was his prisoner.
- Dracula did that?

01:13:16.893 --> 01:13:20.933
Monster he is, who will stop at
nothing to get what he desires.

01:13:21.314 --> 01:13:25.308
I guess I didn't want to see
who he really was.

01:13:25.693 --> 01:13:28.811
Now I may never see
my family again.

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.776
It's alright.

01:13:33.159 --> 01:13:36.368
For you, change that I could.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.997
Who knew dad had it in him?

01:13:45.379 --> 01:13:48.122
I guess he just
needed a holiday?

01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:02.804
Oh, I missed you so much.
Are you okay?

01:14:03.189 --> 01:14:05.772
Yes. Thanks to dad.

01:14:06.150 --> 01:14:08.392
You should have seen him
fight the giant beetle.

01:14:08.778 --> 01:14:11.816
You fought a monster?

01:14:12.198 --> 01:14:13.234
And won.

01:14:13.616 --> 01:14:17.280
What are we doing here?
- And what...

01:14:17.662 --> 01:14:21.406
...is she doing here?
- Here to help, I am.

01:14:21.791 --> 01:14:25.375
She brought us
all together.

01:14:25.753 --> 01:14:27.665
Emma...

01:14:28.089 --> 01:14:30.923
...you mustn't
leave this castle.

01:14:31.300 --> 01:14:33.417
So he can speak.
- Yeah.

01:14:33.803 --> 01:14:36.216
If you don't...

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:40.511
...marry my master,
he will destroy the world.

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.761
What?
- Talk about over-reacting.

01:14:44.146 --> 01:14:48.766
He plans to shoot a giant
ice sphere into the sun and then...

01:14:49.068 --> 01:14:50.855
...the sun
will be extinguished...

01:14:51.237 --> 01:14:53.900
...and all life on Earth
will come to an end.

01:14:54.281 --> 01:14:57.900
Except for vampires.
Who don't need sunlight.

01:14:58.536 --> 01:15:01.370
So in order to save
all life on Earth...

01:15:01.706 --> 01:15:03.868
...I have to marry Dracula?

01:15:04.250 --> 01:15:05.707
Mmm.

01:15:06.085 --> 01:15:09.419
No. We'll stop him.
- But how?

01:15:09.797 --> 01:15:13.336
My master is currently
in his Lazarus bath.

01:15:13.718 --> 01:15:16.051
He needs it to stop
himself from aging.

01:15:16.429 --> 01:15:19.342
Good to know but we're trying
to save the planet here.

01:15:19.724 --> 01:15:23.843
You misunderstand.
In the bath he's helpless.

01:15:24.228 --> 01:15:28.063
But he's only inside
until sunset.

01:15:28.441 --> 01:15:31.730
Okay, we've got no plan
and no time.

01:15:32.153 --> 01:15:35.362
Wait. Does this castle
have a kitchen?

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.029
Only the best
in the catalogue.

01:15:41.829 --> 01:15:45.038
Okay. We need salt,
olive oil and water.

01:15:45.416 --> 01:15:49.535
We're making Dracula pasta?
- With salt, olive oil and sacred balm...

01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:54.711
holy water, you make!
- Major anti-vampire mojo.

01:15:55.217 --> 01:15:58.381
Holy water will beat Dracula?
- For sure.

01:15:58.763 --> 01:16:01.597
Once he's beaten,
we'll lock him up forever.

01:16:02.433 --> 01:16:04.470
Salt and oil.

01:16:04.852 --> 01:16:07.185
And water.
- Er, Max.

01:16:07.563 --> 01:16:10.556
Where will we find sacred
balm in a kitchen?

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:13.228
I don't think it's gonna
be in the spice rack.

01:16:13.611 --> 01:16:16.103
It's been here
all the time.

01:16:16.322 --> 01:16:19.611
Your bandages are steeped
in a sacred embalming fluid.

01:16:20.618 --> 01:16:22.985
Okay. Sometimes being smart...

01:16:23.370 --> 01:16:25.282
...is extremely cool.

01:16:35.257 --> 01:16:38.796
It's amazing what people will do
to knock off just a few years.

01:16:39.178 --> 01:16:41.511
I'm gonna jump on the tank and
I'll pour in the holy water.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:46.141
Awake, the Dark One is.

01:16:46.519 --> 01:16:50.058
Emma, why would you stay
with your wretched family...

01:16:50.439 --> 01:16:54.433
...when we can achieve
greatness together?

01:16:54.819 --> 01:16:58.028
Oh, no, I sense you
brought holy water.

01:16:58.405 --> 01:17:00.897
Wow, how can he smell
through that thing?

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:04.159
Your heart is so dark,
no-one could love you.

01:17:04.829 --> 01:17:07.742
Do be careful. It's very steep.

01:17:08.124 --> 01:17:10.161
- Ouch!
- Told you.

01:17:12.753 --> 01:17:15.917
This is from the Wishbones!

01:17:28.978 --> 01:17:33.188
For every antidote there
is an antiantidote.

01:17:35.568 --> 01:17:36.809
Bon appÃ©tit.

01:17:38.237 --> 01:17:39.728
And welcome back.

01:17:44.201 --> 01:17:45.612
I'm hungry!

01:17:48.747 --> 01:17:53.287
I'm sure your mother's love for you
is bigger than her appetite.

01:17:54.628 --> 01:17:56.119
Memma. Mon't.

01:17:57.548 --> 01:18:01.883
Now bite him and we shall live
together for all eternity.

01:18:02.845 --> 01:18:06.009
You are mine.
You are a vampire.

01:18:06.557 --> 01:18:08.765
Fulfil your destiny.

01:18:10.728 --> 01:18:12.094
I...

01:18:12.479 --> 01:18:15.142
...Immove... you.

01:18:16.984 --> 01:18:19.067
What are you doing?

01:18:22.364 --> 01:18:27.029
Yes, Emma. Do it!
Do it now!

01:18:29.205 --> 01:18:31.788
Emma?
No!

01:18:32.583 --> 01:18:34.575
No!

01:18:36.003 --> 01:18:37.460
Yes!

01:18:38.088 --> 01:18:41.672
The greatest magic,
love is.

01:18:43.010 --> 01:18:44.467
Yuck.

01:18:46.013 --> 01:18:47.470
What?

01:18:53.312 --> 01:18:55.725
Why does this always happen to me?

01:18:55.898 --> 01:18:58.106
You leave my mum alone.

01:19:02.613 --> 01:19:06.072
Ah, so much for romance.

01:19:06.450 --> 01:19:10.490
Humans, why must you
always be so... human?

01:19:25.094 --> 01:19:28.508
Is everyone okay?

01:19:29.765 --> 01:19:33.600
I'm so glad you're awake.
What I have in store for you is...

01:19:33.978 --> 01:19:36.721
...much more enjoyable
if you're conscious.

01:19:37.106 --> 01:19:40.440
The ice sphere is expanding.

01:19:41.318 --> 01:19:44.356
And soon we'll be
ready for launch.

01:19:44.738 --> 01:19:46.855
So I'm afraid it's
going to get very cramped...

01:19:47.241 --> 01:19:50.359
...and very, very
cold in here.

01:19:51.537 --> 01:19:55.121
Let my family go and
I will stay with you.

01:19:55.499 --> 01:19:57.616
It's too late,
I'm afraid...

01:19:58.002 --> 01:20:00.995
...Emma. You chose
your family over me.

01:20:01.380 --> 01:20:04.373
And now I choose
to destroy you.

01:20:04.758 --> 01:20:08.877
Just look at it as a
particularly bad break up.

01:20:20.232 --> 01:20:23.691
You and my traitorous servant
are about to discover what happens...

01:20:24.028 --> 01:20:28.363
...when you betray
the Prince of Darkness.

01:20:29.408 --> 01:20:32.947
I've made a huge mistake and
I got us into this.

01:20:33.329 --> 01:20:34.786
You were right, Fay.

01:20:35.164 --> 01:20:37.622
I'm really good
at messing up.

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:41.497
No, Mum, you were right.
- I was?

01:20:41.879 --> 01:20:45.122
It doesn't matter if people look at
me and see an ugly mummy.

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:48.591
I know who I am under
all these bandages.

01:20:48.969 --> 01:20:51.177
And it's not that much
fun being scary.

01:20:51.555 --> 01:20:54.218
It's actually kind of lonely.
- I'm sorry...

01:20:54.600 --> 01:20:56.887
...I said all those
awful things.

01:20:57.269 --> 01:21:00.933
I wouldn't want any other family.
- Frank...

01:21:01.315 --> 01:21:04.683
...mmove... family.

01:21:05.069 --> 01:21:07.356
I mmove you, too.

01:21:07.738 --> 01:21:09.855
Room for one more?

01:22:11.468 --> 01:22:15.929
You broke the spell!
You're finally happy.

01:22:16.306 --> 01:22:19.799
Come on, we have
to stop Dracula.

01:22:20.144 --> 01:22:22.852
We've just got this little
problem with the chains.

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:25.096
I don't.

01:22:25.482 --> 01:22:27.724
And so you're going
to step up and single-handedly...

01:22:28.110 --> 01:22:30.272
...conquer the
Prince of Darkness...

01:22:30.654 --> 01:22:32.270
...and take us all home.
- What?

01:22:32.656 --> 01:22:35.615
You're the only one
who's not chained up.

01:22:40.539 --> 01:22:41.871
Hey.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:48.252
Hello.

01:22:51.258 --> 01:22:53.841
Wishbones, let's save the world then.

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:59.801
The sun is
about to rise...

01:23:00.184 --> 01:23:03.928
...for the last time, because
very soon, my little friend...

01:23:04.313 --> 01:23:07.101
...your big brother will be
sent to destroy it!

01:23:11.028 --> 01:23:13.771
Not you again.
What are you doing here?

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.489
You are meant to be frozen.

01:23:16.867 --> 01:23:20.031
In your dreams.
The Wishbones never give up.

01:23:20.412 --> 01:23:23.200
Such confidence.
Do tell me, my dear...

01:23:23.624 --> 01:23:26.913
...how do you plan to defeat
a being who can freeze you at will?

01:23:57.491 --> 01:23:59.983
Vile deceivers!

01:24:05.749 --> 01:24:07.957
I guess you're not
so powerful now.

01:24:08.210 --> 01:24:09.872
I can still press a button.

01:24:10.254 --> 01:24:12.541
Not so fast, you creep!

01:24:28.146 --> 01:24:31.560
Take that, and that,
and that, that and...

01:24:34.778 --> 01:24:37.486
Enough of this.

01:24:38.282 --> 01:24:39.989
What's he doing?

01:24:40.367 --> 01:24:42.780
Mrap. I mean crap!

01:24:43.161 --> 01:24:47.121
Pathetic creatures.
Look at you.

01:24:47.499 --> 01:24:50.913
Hideous. Weak. Timid.

01:24:51.295 --> 01:24:55.539
But we are a family.
Something that you will never have.

01:24:55.924 --> 01:24:57.961
And neither will you.

01:24:58.302 --> 01:24:59.918
What now?

01:25:00.304 --> 01:25:03.388
I beat a beetle.
- And won!

01:25:03.765 --> 01:25:06.473
I think I can
deal with that.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:09.428
Okay, let's settle
this man to bat.

01:25:26.163 --> 01:25:27.825
The sun.

01:25:32.210 --> 01:25:35.920
Did you really think
you could defeat me?

01:25:36.298 --> 01:25:38.540
Me?
The Prince of Darkness.

01:25:44.473 --> 01:25:48.342
The Scourge of Transylvania.
Say goodbye to your...

01:26:14.211 --> 01:26:16.328
Pitiful mortals.

01:26:23.303 --> 01:26:26.467
You cannot... defeat...

01:26:42.322 --> 01:26:44.484
Huh, Dracula.

01:26:46.952 --> 01:26:48.693
As I've always said

01:26:49.079 --> 01:26:52.493
it's good to do things
together as a family.

01:27:05.137 --> 01:27:09.006
More work for you, Wishbone.

01:27:09.391 --> 01:27:11.849
No can do.
I'm going home.

01:27:12.227 --> 01:27:15.937
I can fire you, you know.
You should think of your family.

01:27:16.314 --> 01:27:19.182
That's exactly what I'm doing.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:23.186
Wishbone! Wishbone!

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:28.153
<i>It might seem crazy what
I'm about to say</i>

01:27:31.246 --> 01:27:34.159
<i>Sunshine she's here,
you can take a break</i>

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.583
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

01:27:37.836 --> 01:27:41.250
<i>Clap along if you feel
like a room without a roof</i>

01:27:41.840 --> 01:27:43.581
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:47.426
<i>Clap along if you feel
like happiness is the truth</i>

01:27:47.846 --> 01:27:49.587
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

01:27:49.848 --> 01:27:53.262
<i>Clap along if you know
what happiness is to you</i>

01:27:53.852 --> 01:27:55.593
<i>Because I'm happy</i>

01:27:55.854 --> 01:28:00.189
<i>Clap along if you feel
like that's what you wanna do</i>

01:28:01.276 --> 01:28:06.817
<i>Here comes bad news
talking this and that, yeah</i>

01:28:07.282 --> 01:28:11.196
<i>Well, give me all you got,
and don't hold it back</i>

01:28:16.750 --> 01:28:17.911
Da-da!
- Yeah!

01:28:19.294 --> 01:28:21.001
<i>Happy</i>

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:25.210
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:30.886
<i>Happy</i>

01:28:31.306 --> 01:28:36.222
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>

01:28:38.313 --> 01:28:39.929
<i>So happy</i>

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:41.681
Bye.

01:28:42.234 --> 01:28:45.227
<i>Only you
can make me happy</i>

01:28:46.305 --> 01:28:52.887
