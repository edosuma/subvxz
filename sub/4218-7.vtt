WEBVTT

00:01.168 --> 00:02.752
You're the one
who got a problem
with Detective Voight?

00:02.920 --> 00:04.587
Yeah, that's right.
I can help you out.

00:05.005 --> 00:06.297
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:06.465 --> 00:07.423
His name is Casey.

00:07.591 --> 00:10.259
How much?
You stop him for good,
I'll give you two.

00:10.427 --> 00:11.886
Movin' in.

00:12.763 --> 00:13.680
I got him.

00:13.847 --> 00:15.139
You're cooked, Youngblood.

00:15.724 --> 00:16.641
It's gonna be all right.

00:16.809 --> 00:17.809
We're all right now.

00:18.477 --> 00:19.727
It's over.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.979
I get that surgery,
the department
doesn't like how it looks,

00:22.147 --> 00:23.439
I go
on long-term disability.

00:23.607 --> 00:24.816
At 75% pay.

00:24.983 --> 00:27.944
And then do what, Shay?
I fish off Navy Pier
for the next 20 years?

00:28.445 --> 00:29.862
She's dropping gas!

00:30.030 --> 00:30.905
Get a hose on there!

00:31.073 --> 00:32.198
Go!

00:32.908 --> 00:34.826
You're going in there?
You need to get back
behind the lines.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.953
Mouch, get this kid safe.

00:37.121 --> 00:38.788
I'm not gonna pretend
like I don't remember

00:38.956 --> 00:40.998
peeling you off the floor
after that woman
broke your heart.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.166
I know.

00:42.334 --> 00:43.960
I just always thought
she was the one.

00:48.298 --> 00:49.632
Come on!

00:50.843 --> 00:51.884
Get down!

00:59.184 --> 01:00.435
When can we go back inside?

01:00.602 --> 01:02.311
We have to check with
the gas company, ma'am.

01:02.479 --> 01:03.771
And they'll tell you
when it's safe.

01:04.398 --> 01:06.816
Ms. Simpson, I was looking
for Leonard
to get the keys to the shed.

01:06.984 --> 01:07.984
No one's seen him.

01:08.569 --> 01:09.694
Oh, God.

01:09.862 --> 01:10.820
Everyone, stop.

01:10.988 --> 01:12.196
We're going back in.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.288
Leonard!

01:20.456 --> 01:21.664
Down here?

01:21.832 --> 01:22.623
Call out!

01:22.791 --> 01:24.208
You guys
smell anything?

01:25.753 --> 01:26.919
Are we sure
they cut off
the gas lines?

01:27.087 --> 01:28.629
Oh,
I shut it down myself.

01:28.797 --> 01:30.673
Smells like chemicals.

01:31.842 --> 01:33.676
Crystal meth! Masks on!

01:42.394 --> 01:44.687
Really, Leonard,
with the kids up there?

02:05.876 --> 02:07.710
Okay, everyone, listen up.

02:07.878 --> 02:10.755
Everyone on scene will have
a baseline drug test.

02:11.381 --> 02:12.340
Today.

02:12.508 --> 02:13.966
Happy Thanksgiving.
Uh-huh.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.010
Hey, Chief, Dawson and I
didn't go down there.

02:16.178 --> 02:18.596
I don't care.
Anybody on the premises.

02:18.764 --> 02:21.849
We're gonna want to know
how much any of you
may have in your system.

02:22.017 --> 02:23.017
Okay.

02:31.985 --> 02:32.819
Hey.

02:33.821 --> 02:34.987
How you doing?

02:35.155 --> 02:36.197
Pretty good.

02:37.407 --> 02:38.491
Seen you around a few times.

02:39.701 --> 02:41.035
I live around the corner.

02:42.579 --> 02:43.621
I like to watch.

02:44.248 --> 02:45.873
Yeah.
I remember you saying.

02:49.002 --> 02:51.879
Well, you're welcome
to come down to Firehouse 51
anytime you'd like a tour.

02:52.965 --> 02:54.924
Can I ride
on the truck?
Maybe.

02:56.844 --> 02:58.636
Hey.
Hey.

03:01.098 --> 03:02.890
I may have taken something
this morning.

03:04.226 --> 03:05.434
Toradol?
Stronger.

03:05.602 --> 03:06.602
What?

03:11.108 --> 03:13.901
Michael Jackson couldn't have handled those.
Where'd you get those?

03:14.570 --> 03:15.862
Will it show up
on the test?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.241
Will these narcotics
show up on a drug test?

03:44.349 --> 03:45.433
Hey.

03:45.851 --> 03:49.020
What?
Seriously, why don't
we do this more often?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.897
Okay.

03:54.860 --> 03:56.944
Uh, Lieutenant,
you got some visitors.

03:58.822 --> 04:00.031
They're early.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.450
My sister has ruined
more nooners for me

04:02.618 --> 04:04.410
than the rest
of the world combined.

04:05.829 --> 04:07.747
You had a lot of these
growing up?

04:08.248 --> 04:10.541
How do you think
I put myself
through med school?

04:13.253 --> 04:15.713
Come on, Aunt Hallie.
It starts in five minutes.

04:15.881 --> 04:17.757
Uh-oh,
what do we have here?

04:17.925 --> 04:19.342
VIP guests for the parade?

04:19.509 --> 04:20.927
Aunt Hallie!
Hey.

04:21.094 --> 04:22.553
Hey, Viv.
How ya doing?

04:22.721 --> 04:24.013
Can't complain.
Good?

04:24.181 --> 04:26.515
How's, um...
How's your mom?
Viv.

04:26.683 --> 04:29.310
No, it's fine. She's, um,
she's doing all right.

04:30.729 --> 04:32.021
Thanks for asking.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.898
Now, who's gonna
bring me back
some candy?

04:34.066 --> 04:35.316
I will!
Yeah!

04:35.484 --> 04:36.859
Hey, tell your mom
you get to eat

04:37.027 --> 04:38.319
as much as you can fit
in your mouth.

04:38.487 --> 04:39.737
Right.

04:39.905 --> 04:40.947
You guys have fun.

04:41.114 --> 04:42.490
Bye.
Bye.

04:42.658 --> 04:44.075
See you when you get back.

04:49.247 --> 04:50.539
Look at you.

04:50.707 --> 04:51.707
Restaurant tricks.

04:51.875 --> 04:52.959
Impressive.

04:59.174 --> 05:00.216
Look at these chumps.

05:01.301 --> 05:03.135
Are you kidding, man?
Parade detail is great.

05:04.221 --> 05:06.514
Peter Mills, hold your arm up.

05:07.474 --> 05:09.809
Now keep it there
for five hours.

05:09.977 --> 05:11.560
That's what
being in the parade is.

05:11.728 --> 05:15.731
Mills, the Shriners,
they throw out candy,
you clean up, man.

05:15.899 --> 05:18.150
Now, listen, I know you guys
are gonna
give me crap for this.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.527
Go on.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.614
I want to start a podcast.

05:23.782 --> 05:24.865
What the hell's that?

05:25.033 --> 05:29.328
Well, when I record myself
being equal parts
charming and brilliant,

05:29.788 --> 05:31.580
and then I put it up
on iTunes,

05:31.748 --> 05:33.165
and people subscribe,
and they follow me.

05:33.333 --> 05:35.209
A mute would be better
at that than you.

05:38.005 --> 05:38.963
It's going to be
a day in the life

05:39.131 --> 05:40.548
of a Chicago firefighter
sort of thing.

05:40.716 --> 05:43.175
We have a slow day,
and you're just
gonna reinforce

05:43.343 --> 05:45.970
the stereotype
that all we do
is sit around and eat.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.015
You got a problem
with it, Lieutenant?

05:49.516 --> 05:50.766
Go for it.

05:50.934 --> 05:52.643
Drug tester's on his way.

05:52.811 --> 05:55.646
And again,
this is mandatory.

05:56.273 --> 05:58.816
Hey, Chief, there's a kid
outside looking for you.

05:58.984 --> 06:00.067
Thanks.

06:02.612 --> 06:04.739
Good. You came on by.

06:06.450 --> 06:08.659
You said it was cool.
It is, it is.

06:09.411 --> 06:11.203
What's your name?
Ernie.

06:11.371 --> 06:13.664
Ernie? Chief Boden.

06:17.836 --> 06:18.794
You hungry, Ernie?

06:21.298 --> 06:23.716
Hey, everybody.
This here is Ernie.

06:23.884 --> 06:25.384
He's gonna be eating
some turkey with us.

06:25.552 --> 06:27.303
- What's up, Ernie?
- Hey, Ernie.

06:27.471 --> 06:29.513
Hey, I need
a sous-chef, Chief.

06:29.681 --> 06:32.558
Get over here, little man,
we got
a turkey dinner to prepare.

06:33.060 --> 06:34.310
- Go ahead.
- Come on.

06:36.229 --> 06:40.107
First thing we
gotta do, taste this gravy.
Tell me what you think.

06:43.111 --> 06:44.487
Good.
It's good.

06:45.238 --> 06:46.530
Where'd you find
that mutt?

06:46.698 --> 06:49.700
I just want to see
what's going on with him.

06:50.869 --> 06:51.952
You catch a vibe?

06:53.538 --> 06:55.581
I've seen him at two
different fire scenes.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.043
Chief, if we got
a firebug here,

06:59.211 --> 07:01.629
you know it's next
to impossible
to prove anything.

07:01.797 --> 07:03.798
Can you just spend
some time with him?

07:04.883 --> 07:06.050
See what we find out.

07:09.513 --> 07:10.638
Yo, Ernie.

07:10.806 --> 07:12.848
Don't let Mills here
make you do all the work.

07:13.016 --> 07:14.767
He's what we call
a Candidate.

07:14.935 --> 07:17.603
You know how there's
all those rungs
on a ladder?

07:17.771 --> 07:19.438
He's the bottom one.
Oh!

07:20.524 --> 07:22.316
Come on,
I'll give you a tour.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.029
Hey, heads up.

07:27.572 --> 07:29.990
Hey, what are you
doing here
on Thanksgiving?

07:30.158 --> 07:31.534
Reinforcements.

07:31.701 --> 07:34.829
Truck 81, Ambulance 61.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.790
Multiple gunshot wounds.
1542 Elmwood Park.

07:37.958 --> 07:38.916
Hey, would you put
the turkey in?

07:39.084 --> 07:40.000
Sure.
Thank you.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.837
This meal is very important.
Kid, you should stay...
Forget that. Come on.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.090
Chief.
Yeah, I got him.
Ernie, stand here.

07:47.801 --> 07:48.843
Let's go, let's go!

08:02.107 --> 08:03.983
That was awesome.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.609
Always is.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.374
Someone stepped
on the anthill today.

08:31.136 --> 08:33.012
Get down!

08:35.974 --> 08:36.974
Oh!

08:37.142 --> 08:38.392
Ambulance 61,
I need a 10-1
at Elmwood Park.

08:38.560 --> 08:39.476
You okay?
Yeah.

08:39.644 --> 08:40.686
They're still shooting here.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.104
Copy that.

08:42.981 --> 08:43.814
Where the hell's the CPD?

08:43.982 --> 08:46.108
Help me, I'm bleeding!

08:54.201 --> 08:56.410
Truck, ammo, move.

08:57.454 --> 08:58.495
Get ready to move.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.623
Crawl out the other side.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.042
Cruz!
Yeah?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.461
Move the truck forward,
so we can use it
as a barrier.

09:05.629 --> 09:06.670
On it.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.634
Let's go. Come on.

09:25.607 --> 09:26.982
Hey, man, you awake?

09:28.318 --> 09:29.443
All right, turn him over.

09:30.987 --> 09:33.322
Ah, I got three holes,
only two exit wounds.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.115
Get him a backboard.

09:36.159 --> 09:37.368
Yo. Yo!

09:38.078 --> 09:39.245
There's another kid
over there by that tree.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.454
Two, three.

09:40.622 --> 09:41.664
All right,
you got this, Shay?

09:41.831 --> 09:42.915
Yeah.

09:45.168 --> 09:46.585
Shooters are in the window!

09:48.129 --> 09:50.089
Police.
You're surrounded.

09:50.507 --> 09:52.007
They're heading north.
Go, go!

09:54.135 --> 09:55.302
Stop! Police!

09:55.470 --> 09:57.054
Hey, you hurt, buddy?

09:58.723 --> 09:59.974
Leon?

10:01.268 --> 10:02.851
What the hell
are you doing here, Leon?

10:03.019 --> 10:04.061
You know this guy?

10:04.229 --> 10:05.896
All right, this is
a through by through.

10:06.064 --> 10:07.940
You're gonna take this
four by four,
you're gonna hold it...

10:08.108 --> 10:08.816
Chill.
Sorry.

10:08.984 --> 10:10.442
Keep it from bleeding.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.528
And then you're gonna wait
for the next ambulance, okay?

10:12.696 --> 10:13.821
I got it. Let it go.

10:19.411 --> 10:20.744
To hell with this.

10:20.912 --> 10:23.414
Yo, you trippin', man.

10:23.581 --> 10:25.416
Cruz, what's going on?
Move!

10:26.251 --> 10:27.835
What are you doing?

10:28.295 --> 10:29.837
Help him in.
Take it easy, yo.

10:30.005 --> 10:31.005
Cruz.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.339
He's my brother.

10:38.972 --> 10:43.058
So you're trying to tell me
that the CPD doesn't know
how to handle a shift change.

10:44.728 --> 10:45.602
That is unacceptable.

10:45.770 --> 10:48.731
I had firefighters
walking unprotected
into a damn turf war.

10:48.898 --> 10:51.567
Our turnout gear
is not bulletproof.

10:52.319 --> 10:54.528
Yeah, well, I suggest
that you figure it out.

10:55.363 --> 10:56.947
Uh-huh, yeah.

10:58.116 --> 10:59.867
Yeah, I'll hold you to that.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.788
Chief. They're looking
for you in the common room.

11:12.714 --> 11:14.089
The bullet went through
without hitting any bone.

11:14.257 --> 11:15.507
He should be fine.

11:18.178 --> 11:21.472
Can I talk to him?
No, I gave him something
to sleep, but after that...

11:22.807 --> 11:24.558
Wanna stay here?

11:26.269 --> 11:27.853
No, man, I better not.

11:28.980 --> 11:30.856
Doctor.
Be right there.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.566
Thank you.
Sure.

11:34.152 --> 11:36.195
Can you hand me
a slice of bread?

11:36.363 --> 11:37.488
Yeah.

11:41.242 --> 11:42.910
Really?

11:43.370 --> 11:45.788
It's supposed to keep
your eyes from tearing up.

11:45.955 --> 11:47.081
Doesn't look like
it's working.

11:47.248 --> 11:49.041
It never does.
I don't know
why I keep doing it.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.001
All right, let me
give it a shot.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.712
You're gonna tear up.
I don't think so.

11:55.465 --> 11:56.840
See?
Mmm-hmm.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.217
I'm good.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.805
All right, okay,
let me try a piece.

12:06.309 --> 12:10.062
Can I help you?
Yeah, just point the way
to Chief Boden or whatnot.

12:10.647 --> 12:13.232
I'm Boden.
Dan Jenkins. EnsurTech.

12:13.400 --> 12:15.776
I understand you have
a situation here.

12:15.944 --> 12:17.861
Yeah,
sorry to make you
work Thanksgiving.

12:18.029 --> 12:19.655
Yeah.
It is what it is.

12:19.823 --> 12:21.448
I just go where
they tell me.

12:21.616 --> 12:25.661
Well, I got a few bucks
on the Cowboys game,
so let's get her done.

12:26.830 --> 12:29.081
Do you want to
set up in the...
Who's first?

12:39.134 --> 12:40.384
Hey.
Hey.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.344
You, uh...
You put the turkey in?

12:42.512 --> 12:44.471
Of course.
And you tent the white meat
with the foil?

12:44.639 --> 12:46.014
I taught you
to tent the white meat.

12:46.724 --> 12:47.933
Okay.

12:50.437 --> 12:51.728
You're in my spot.

12:51.896 --> 12:53.689
Which one of you
is Joe Cruz?

12:53.857 --> 12:55.482
- I am.
- Fill 'er up.

12:58.695 --> 13:01.280
Hey, uh, does it matter
if I had a ton of pancakes
this morning?

13:01.448 --> 13:03.115
It matters if they
were made of crack.

13:03.616 --> 13:04.992
- Peter Mills.
- Yep.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.454
Thanks.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.982
Hey, Chief said
you live around here.

13:37.692 --> 13:38.775
Over on Racine.

13:40.278 --> 13:41.904
You got any brothers
and sisters?

13:43.781 --> 13:45.032
Lucky you.

13:45.200 --> 13:48.452
All I got
was my brother's crap
after he put holes in it.

13:49.913 --> 13:51.455
What about your folks?

13:52.290 --> 13:53.415
What about 'em?

13:54.709 --> 13:55.834
They around?

13:59.088 --> 14:00.672
Yeah, look,

14:00.840 --> 14:03.800
my old man was
in and out too, so I know.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.221
Let's go get...
Mine's in jail.

14:10.350 --> 14:11.600
I'm sorry.

14:12.894 --> 14:14.311
You get to see him at all?

14:15.647 --> 14:16.730
Nah.

14:17.482 --> 14:18.899
Grandma don't drive.

14:23.780 --> 14:24.821
Ugh!

14:24.989 --> 14:26.657
Joining the parade
would be faster.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.659
Can you move?

14:28.826 --> 14:29.743
Whoa!

14:29.911 --> 14:31.787
Jeez, Shay, relax.

14:32.789 --> 14:35.624
Sorry.
We could toss these
pork rinds to the kids.

14:39.921 --> 14:40.796
Oh, check it out.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.175
Whose fault
do you think it is?

14:48.888 --> 14:50.931
Woman's.
It's always the woman's.

14:51.099 --> 14:52.307
That's why
I'm happily single.

14:57.438 --> 14:59.731
Dude.
I know, it's a goat.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.317
But it's our goat.

15:04.529 --> 15:06.947
Oh, Shay, you got a visitor.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.747
Hey. Look what
the cat dragged in.

15:15.915 --> 15:17.708
Cat brought pumpkin pie.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.752
Hey, Clarice.
Mmm.

15:21.546 --> 15:23.547
I hope this isn't
totally inconvenient.

15:24.090 --> 15:25.674
No, no, no, of course not.
I just... I, uh...

15:25.842 --> 15:28.510
I wanted to say thank you,
you know,
today for that, I guess.

15:29.012 --> 15:30.512
Oh, of course.

15:30.972 --> 15:32.514
It was just
so good to see you.

15:32.682 --> 15:35.601
It was really good.
I was, uh...
I was blown away.

15:38.062 --> 15:39.646
Gabriela Dawson.

15:44.736 --> 15:46.486
Oh, checking for meth.

15:46.654 --> 15:47.988
You know.

15:49.157 --> 15:51.074
Can I get you some coffee
or something?

15:51.242 --> 15:52.576
Decaf.

15:52.744 --> 15:54.911
Okay. Have a seat.

16:00.501 --> 16:02.961
Hey, can I borrow you
for a second?

16:06.549 --> 16:09.885
Okay, and three, two, one.

16:10.053 --> 16:11.845
And...  Recording.

16:13.056 --> 16:14.806
Hi,
I'm Brian Zvonecek,

16:14.974 --> 16:17.643
and we're picking up
where I last left off.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.645
Oh! Look who just walked in.

16:20.563 --> 16:22.856
It's firefighter
Randy McHolland,

16:23.024 --> 16:27.569
better known around
Firehouse 51 as Mouch.

16:28.071 --> 16:30.113
Mouch, where'd the nickname
come from?

16:32.450 --> 16:34.076
Do I need to talk loud
or just normal?

16:34.243 --> 16:36.328
Just talk normal.
Normal.

16:36.496 --> 16:37.829
Yeah.
Got it.

16:37.997 --> 16:39.206
Okay. All right.
Okay.

16:39.374 --> 16:42.292
And three, two,
one, and...

16:43.211 --> 16:44.753
Recording.

16:44.921 --> 16:46.630
Mouch,
how you doing today?

16:47.757 --> 16:49.758
Do I need to push the button,
or you just want me to...

16:49.926 --> 16:53.095
No, no, just...
Just talk normal.

16:53.262 --> 16:54.638
Okay? Just...
Normal.

16:54.806 --> 16:55.931
Be normal.
Okay, okay, okay.

16:56.099 --> 16:57.140
Okay.

16:58.017 --> 16:59.393
And recording.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.561
How ya doin', Mouch?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.272
Happy Thanksgiving,
everybody.

17:04.982 --> 17:06.233
Yes!

17:06.401 --> 17:08.026
So tell us
about the nickname.

17:08.986 --> 17:10.112
Uh...

17:10.655 --> 17:12.948
Okay, uh...

17:14.283 --> 17:16.118
Well, okay, it's...
There's...

17:16.285 --> 17:19.454
There's two halves
to it, right?

17:19.622 --> 17:23.417
So you got...
Over here, you got
half man, right?

17:24.252 --> 17:25.836
And then, uh...

17:26.796 --> 17:30.799
Over here, the other half
would be, um, half, uh...

17:32.969 --> 17:34.594
Couch, I guess?

17:43.771 --> 17:45.272
Okay, cool.

17:46.149 --> 17:48.900
Yeah, well, you tell mom
to save me a piece of cobbler.

17:49.068 --> 17:50.402
Okay.

17:50.570 --> 17:52.446
Yeah, I love you too,
Antonio.

17:53.281 --> 17:56.116
Okay, you tell him
happy turkey day for me.

17:56.826 --> 17:57.909
Bye.

18:07.253 --> 18:08.545
Clarice.

18:09.046 --> 18:10.130
Gabriela.

18:11.007 --> 18:14.384
Uh, I don't mean
to butt into your business
or anything, but...

18:17.180 --> 18:18.805
Leslie's in a really
great place right now,

18:18.973 --> 18:20.724
and you're...

18:21.517 --> 18:23.185
... pregnant.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.855
It's Thanksgiving.

18:27.023 --> 18:28.857
Why don't you go home
and spend it
with your husband?

18:31.611 --> 18:33.278
I just came by
to say thank you.

18:34.697 --> 18:36.281
Yeah, and you did.

18:52.048 --> 18:53.799
Is there some masking agent
I could take?

18:53.966 --> 18:56.301
To throw off a drug test?
Today?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.469
Come on.

18:57.637 --> 18:59.179
Look, I'm... I'm looking
for a way out here.

18:59.347 --> 19:03.058
What about
poppy seed muffins
or something like that?

19:03.226 --> 19:05.352
I heard that that can...
Do you have 70 of them?

19:05.520 --> 19:06.895
Because that's what
it would take.

19:08.940 --> 19:10.273
Look, I warned you.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.859
Please leave my name
out of this.

19:16.072 --> 19:17.656
You're Severide?

19:19.367 --> 19:20.534
Fill 'er up.

19:45.351 --> 19:46.434
Leon.

19:46.602 --> 19:48.019
Hey, you picked up.

19:48.980 --> 19:50.021
How you feeling?

19:50.189 --> 19:51.773
Terrible, yo.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.609
They said they're
keeping me overnight
for a test or something.

19:55.152 --> 19:57.529
Yeah, no, I'm sure
that's only a precaution.

19:58.906 --> 20:02.742
Hey, listen, I get off
my shift at 8:00 a.m.,
so I'm gonna come pick you up.

20:03.286 --> 20:05.537
Yo, if you're gonna
be all up on me,
I'll just take the bus.

20:05.705 --> 20:09.291
Sí, está bien. No BS.
No speeches.

20:10.918 --> 20:12.627
I just wanna get you home.

20:16.048 --> 20:18.341
Fine. 8:00 a.m.

20:21.262 --> 20:22.888
Yeah, I'll see you then.

20:28.644 --> 20:29.436
Ooh!

20:29.604 --> 20:31.021
Holy mackerel.

20:32.940 --> 20:34.608
Oh.
No, I wouldn't do that
if I were you.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.775
Boden will kill you.

20:35.943 --> 20:37.694
Whoa, whoa,
you're not carving
that thing, are you?

20:37.862 --> 20:40.113
No. What, do you think
I'm crazy?

20:43.034 --> 20:44.200
Hey, where's Clarice?

20:45.828 --> 20:47.454
Uh, she said
she had to get home.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.082
That's weird.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.794
Yeah, well, she always was.

20:54.962 --> 20:56.421
Cowboys, channel four.

20:56.881 --> 20:58.924
Ah, now we're talking.

21:00.718 --> 21:02.427
Missing a sample, Chief.

21:02.845 --> 21:03.887
Who?

21:04.055 --> 21:05.305
Kelly Severide.

21:06.557 --> 21:07.974
Let's see what the holdup is.

21:08.768 --> 21:09.726
You joining us?

21:12.355 --> 21:13.980
If it's okay.
Ah, are ya kiddin' me?

21:14.148 --> 21:15.398
I'll set the table.
Come on.

21:15.566 --> 21:16.608
I'll call everybody
to chow.

21:16.776 --> 21:17.901
Whoo!

21:18.903 --> 21:20.070
Hey.

21:20.863 --> 21:22.280
What happened
to your sister
and the kids?

21:22.448 --> 21:24.199
They ran into a bunch
of families from their school

21:24.367 --> 21:25.700
and got a ride home.

21:25.868 --> 21:27.911
That's too bad,
I was gonna
put 'em in the gear.

21:28.079 --> 21:29.663
I know.
That was sweet.

21:29.830 --> 21:30.956
We'll do it next time.
Okay.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.584
How was it?
It was great, actually.

21:34.752 --> 21:35.919
Yeah?
Yeah. I don't know
how she does it,

21:36.087 --> 21:37.629
but they're amazing kids.

21:39.882 --> 21:41.091
Chow, chow.

21:42.343 --> 21:43.426
Turkey time.

21:43.594 --> 21:45.553
I'm... I'm meeting
my parents at the club.

21:45.721 --> 21:46.805
Stay for a bite.

21:48.015 --> 21:50.141
You're staying for a bite.
Come on.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.726
I insist.

21:52.269 --> 21:53.979
Watching your weight?

21:56.232 --> 21:58.525
I put it down, and I don't
know what I did with it.

21:58.693 --> 22:01.820
We got food and football.
Could be worse.

22:02.822 --> 22:03.697
Right?

22:03.864 --> 22:05.740
Okay, we got cranberries,

22:05.908 --> 22:07.659
gravy,
that stuffing is the sh...

22:07.827 --> 22:10.704
Uh, sorry. Ernie, that...
That stuffing
is really good.

22:11.789 --> 22:13.039
Dig in.

22:13.207 --> 22:15.542
This is the best-lookin' bird
that we've had in years.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.421
Okay, what are we
gonna name it?

22:19.588 --> 22:20.672
Oh, jeesh.

22:20.840 --> 22:21.548
- Name it?
- Yeah.

22:21.716 --> 22:23.133
Always name the bird
before you eat it.

22:23.300 --> 22:25.343
Usually after
an old girlfriend
or boyfriend or something.

22:25.761 --> 22:27.387
Ah, interesting.

22:27.555 --> 22:29.347
That's funny.
How 'bout Leon?

22:30.683 --> 22:32.475
You want to name the bird
after your own brother?

22:32.643 --> 22:33.935
After today?

22:35.479 --> 22:36.938
Leon it is.

22:39.525 --> 22:43.945
Squad 3, Truck 81,
Engine 51, Ambulance 61.

22:44.113 --> 22:45.280
Here, Jenkins,
I'll hit it
when I get back.

22:45.448 --> 22:48.033
Home residence fire.
6542 Cook street.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.451
Gotta go, kid.

22:50.536 --> 22:51.828
Let's go, let's go!

23:11.348 --> 23:12.891
Turkey fire, guaranteed.

23:15.811 --> 23:17.687
Uh, what happened?

23:17.855 --> 23:18.938
Uncle Brad is what happened.

23:19.106 --> 23:21.608
I know how to deep-fry
a gol-durn turkey, Sharon.

23:21.776 --> 23:22.776
You put in
too much grease.

23:22.943 --> 23:24.486
You can't fry
a beer can turkey.

23:24.653 --> 23:26.654
Is everyone
out of the house?
Duh.

23:26.822 --> 23:28.239
Why aren't you putting out
the freakin' fire?

23:28.407 --> 23:30.825
Engine'll be here any moment.
Cruz, cancel.

23:31.243 --> 23:32.952
All right, is anybody hurt?
Is anybody burned?

23:33.120 --> 23:34.454
You guys okay?
Okay.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.872
Guess we're gonna
go back and eat.

23:36.040 --> 23:38.625
What?
I told him, "If you put
a beer can in a bird's ass,

23:38.793 --> 23:39.709
"it's gonna explode."

23:39.877 --> 23:41.503
And I told you,
you dumb bitch,
if you bark at me...

23:41.670 --> 23:43.088
Kick his ass!
Whoa!

23:43.923 --> 23:44.923
I'll get...

23:45.091 --> 23:46.591
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, hey!
Kick his ass, T!

23:46.759 --> 23:47.801
Down!

23:49.845 --> 23:50.804
Knock it off!

23:52.389 --> 23:53.681
Oh, God.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.809
My snowmobile.
Get back!

24:03.859 --> 24:05.527
Vent the back.
Window.

24:13.911 --> 24:15.036
Door.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.129
All right,
let's wrap it up.

24:29.552 --> 24:30.802
Let me go!

24:30.970 --> 24:33.138
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

24:42.439 --> 24:43.940
Hey, yo, Elise.

24:44.108 --> 24:47.443
Turkey's in the fridge
with the stuffing,

24:47.611 --> 24:50.613
and the rolls are left out,
but they should be
all right.

24:50.781 --> 24:52.031
Thank you for your help.

24:57.454 --> 24:59.831
You look just like
that picture of pop,
you know that?

25:03.794 --> 25:04.919
See you tomorrow.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.303
Oh! Yeah.

25:14.555 --> 25:15.763
Mmm.

25:17.308 --> 25:19.767
Hey, whoa, wait,
let me heat it up.
Give me 10 minutes.

25:19.935 --> 25:22.478
Yeah, we got
a microwave, just...

25:22.980 --> 25:24.022
Microwave?

25:24.190 --> 25:25.982
Give me 10 minutes.
It'll be worth it.

25:37.077 --> 25:38.077
What's the score?

25:38.245 --> 25:39.454
Nothing, nothing.

25:41.707 --> 25:42.832
Where's Kelly Severide?

25:57.848 --> 25:59.098
Let's gas up.

26:00.226 --> 26:01.809
We got three quarters
of a tank.

26:01.977 --> 26:03.519
Let's do it anyway.

26:09.735 --> 26:11.611
- That's right.
- That's cool.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.446
Hey, you wanted
to see us, Chief?

26:13.614 --> 26:16.032
Yeah, Ernie here
has been waiting to sit
behind the wheel

26:16.200 --> 26:18.326
of an honest-to-God
Chicago fire truck.

26:18.869 --> 26:20.286
Do you think
that you could
arrange that?

26:20.454 --> 26:21.955
Only if he doesn't
try to take my job.

26:22.498 --> 26:23.706
Hmm.

26:23.874 --> 26:24.999
Come on, Ernie.

26:26.043 --> 26:28.628
Oh, and, uh,
give me back my helmet.

26:30.881 --> 26:31.839
Enjoy.

26:36.011 --> 26:37.804
And?

26:38.597 --> 26:40.807
Ah, his dad's in prison,

26:40.975 --> 26:42.934
and his mom is gone
and probably an addict.

26:43.727 --> 26:45.353
He hasn't seen her
in years.

26:45.521 --> 26:49.857
He lives with his grandma,
and from what he says,
she ain't all there.

26:51.527 --> 26:52.777
Do you think
he's an arsonist?

26:54.405 --> 26:55.530
He needs an outlet.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.949
He's looking
for some control
in his life.

26:58.409 --> 27:02.453
Maybe that backpack's
got something incendiary
he tosses into a dumpster,

27:02.621 --> 27:04.914
and he gets a high
watching us roll up.

27:06.000 --> 27:07.041
It fits.

27:08.127 --> 27:09.752
But am I sure?

27:15.676 --> 27:16.884
Just be careful.

27:17.845 --> 27:18.886
Of what?

27:19.847 --> 27:22.015
Don't replace
a kid you lost

27:23.225 --> 27:24.934
with a kid
you can't save.

27:35.946 --> 27:37.030
Hey.

27:37.823 --> 27:39.282
So how was it?

27:39.450 --> 27:41.534
Cool. Can I go for a ride?

27:41.702 --> 27:43.244
Yeah, someday.

27:47.249 --> 27:49.083
Answer me
something, Ernie.

27:50.461 --> 27:52.211
What do you carry around
in that backpack there?

27:53.714 --> 27:55.256
Stuff.
Stuff?

27:56.425 --> 27:57.717
Can I see it?

27:59.887 --> 28:00.762
Why?

28:00.929 --> 28:02.513
Just curious is why.

28:04.433 --> 28:05.475
It's mine.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.603
I know it's yours.
I just want to see what
you got carrying around.

28:10.022 --> 28:12.231
No.
Why are you
getting so upset?

28:12.399 --> 28:13.691
Because you're
making fun of me.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.443
I'm not making fun
of you, I promise.
Yes, you are!

28:16.070 --> 28:16.944
Ernie, calm down.

28:17.654 --> 28:18.654
I want to help you.

28:18.822 --> 28:19.864
Get away from me.
You don't know me.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.449
Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

28:21.617 --> 28:22.992
You don't know anything!
Calm down.

28:23.160 --> 28:24.369
Bitch!

28:53.982 --> 28:55.608
Uh, coming right up.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.664
Oh, baby.

29:55.752 --> 30:00.006
Squad 3, Truck 81,
Engine 51, Ambulance 61.

30:00.174 --> 30:01.757
Hey, sorry
it took so long.

30:11.518 --> 30:14.604
We got
at least ten cars
at mile marker 54.

30:14.771 --> 30:15.730
We're gonna need
more of everything.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.651
Over here.
My husband...

30:20.819 --> 30:22.820
Please, you have to help him.

30:24.823 --> 30:26.449
Gonna get that truck?
I got it, Chief.

30:28.744 --> 30:30.870
It's my husband.
His neck is bleeding.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.497
What's his name?
Craig.

30:33.040 --> 30:34.874
Hey, Craig.
Can you hear me?

30:35.834 --> 30:37.210
Are you hurt anywhere else
besides your neck?

30:37.753 --> 30:39.420
Okay, I need you
to remove your hand

30:39.588 --> 30:40.922
so that we can take
a look, okay?

30:42.508 --> 30:43.758
Oh, arterial bleed.

30:43.926 --> 30:45.134
Shay, can you give me
some more four by fours?

30:47.387 --> 30:48.804
Just give me everything
we got in the ambo.

30:52.017 --> 30:54.143
There we go.
Okay, just head over
to the median.

30:58.941 --> 31:00.608
My son
is in the back!

31:03.946 --> 31:05.863
Somebody, please!
Help us!

31:14.331 --> 31:15.873
We got a pin-in over here!

31:17.042 --> 31:18.459
Ma'am, you okay?

31:20.254 --> 31:21.504
Cover up.

31:29.179 --> 31:30.388
Carol.

31:31.390 --> 31:32.640
Carol, are you okay?

31:41.900 --> 31:43.109
Carol, oh, my God!

31:44.903 --> 31:46.571
Sir, we're gonna
get her out.

31:46.738 --> 31:48.823
We'll get a paramedic here
as soon as we can.
She's having a baby.

31:51.910 --> 31:52.785
Do something!

31:54.746 --> 31:56.831
Okay, we need to move
this car
and get this door open!

32:05.173 --> 32:07.216
And lift!

32:07.676 --> 32:08.926
And lift...

32:14.933 --> 32:16.183
Okay, let's do it.
All right.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.269
I'm trying.

32:20.897 --> 32:22.106
All right, sir.
Get out.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.570
Dawson, Shay?

32:28.030 --> 32:30.823
Hey, we gotta get
a tow truck in here
to clear a path for the ambo.

32:30.991 --> 32:31.949
This one's gotta move now.

32:32.117 --> 32:33.659
- Stay here.
- Yeah.

32:33.827 --> 32:35.536
I need you guys
up next to 81.

32:35.704 --> 32:37.580
We're stuck here, Casey.
Arterial bleed.

32:40.083 --> 32:41.250
Mike's open.

32:41.418 --> 32:44.211
Uh, I got a woman
about to give birth
on the highway.

32:45.380 --> 32:46.631
Is the baby crowning?

32:47.424 --> 32:48.674
Yeah, I can see
the top of the head.

32:48.842 --> 32:51.510
Oh, God, he's coming!
I can feel him coming.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.931
Okay, you're gonna
have to do this, Casey.

33:00.062 --> 33:01.062
Continue breathing, honey.

33:02.272 --> 33:03.522
Otis.

33:07.027 --> 33:07.902
Oh, God, he's coming!

33:09.279 --> 33:10.529
Hey!

33:10.697 --> 33:11.989
Hey, hey!
Clear this one first!

33:13.492 --> 33:14.450
He's coming!

33:14.618 --> 33:16.243
All right, Casey,
tell me what you see.

33:17.079 --> 33:18.704
I can see the head.

33:18.872 --> 33:20.956
It keeps coming out
and then going back.

33:21.375 --> 33:22.416
Tell her to push.

33:23.919 --> 33:25.294
You gotta push, Carol.
I am.

33:29.049 --> 33:31.592
Here. I'll swing
the ambo around.

33:34.096 --> 33:34.887
Go, Carol!

33:36.640 --> 33:37.640
Push harder.

33:40.977 --> 33:42.103
Okay.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.231
One more big breath
and a push.

33:45.399 --> 33:47.566
Let's do this.

33:57.285 --> 33:58.327
Casey?

34:00.622 --> 34:02.540
Dawson, he's not crying.
I don't think he's breathing.

34:04.209 --> 34:05.292
It's an
obstructed airway.

34:05.460 --> 34:08.129
You have to put your mouth
over the baby's
nose and mouth

34:08.296 --> 34:09.422
and breathe for it.

34:09.589 --> 34:10.923
It's just like CPR.

34:14.010 --> 34:16.053
Okay, get your leg up
if you can.

34:16.513 --> 34:19.140
All right, sir,
can you walk?
I got you.

34:27.941 --> 34:29.191
Casey.

34:29.359 --> 34:31.360
Is he okay?
Is he okay?

34:35.198 --> 34:36.365
Casey.

34:51.506 --> 34:53.132
All right,
let's get him in.

35:34.090 --> 35:35.257
Great shift, men.

35:35.675 --> 35:37.176
Proud of all of you.

35:37.594 --> 35:39.220
Leon, your time is here.

35:39.721 --> 35:42.389
Hey, uh, Chief,
maybe another name?

35:44.100 --> 35:46.602
Sure.
Call it Jenkins,
the piss guy.

35:48.855 --> 35:50.689
Jenkins it is.

35:51.691 --> 35:55.236
You'll be pleased to know
that all your tests
came through negative on meth

35:55.737 --> 35:57.029
or any other drug.

35:57.197 --> 35:58.531
All right, yeah.

35:58.698 --> 36:00.783
God bless us, everyone!

36:01.618 --> 36:04.620
Damn, Peter Mills.
You were not kidding
about that stuffing.

36:04.788 --> 36:06.789
Hey, Chief,
don't be stingy
with the turkey!

36:06.957 --> 36:07.957
Get outta here.

36:08.124 --> 36:09.959
You know
what your first delivery
means, Casey?

36:10.126 --> 36:11.544
Everyone buys you a round.

36:12.712 --> 36:13.671
Sounds good.

36:14.589 --> 36:15.714
Dig in!

36:15.882 --> 36:17.675
Come on!
All right!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.218
Give me some of that corn.

36:19.386 --> 36:20.553
Yeah, I gotta get
some of that stuffing.

36:20.720 --> 36:21.804
This looks incredible.

36:23.932 --> 36:25.015
Don't eat all that!

36:29.437 --> 36:30.646
Happy Thanksgiving!

36:30.814 --> 36:31.522
Hear, hear!

36:43.034 --> 36:44.743
A lot of people out there

36:44.911 --> 36:46.871
are probably wondering
why we do this job.

36:47.038 --> 36:48.831
Um, and it's true.

36:50.333 --> 36:51.625
Some days are bad.

36:54.921 --> 36:56.005
What were you gonna do?

36:57.257 --> 36:58.340
I don't know.

37:01.720 --> 37:03.846
I don't know who this is,
Kelly, but it isn't you.

37:06.391 --> 37:07.683
Do you want a ride or not?

37:10.020 --> 37:12.479
You know what?
Happy Thanksgiving.

37:15.901 --> 37:18.569
We grope around
in zero visibility,

37:18.737 --> 37:20.571
hoping we grab onto an arm

37:20.739 --> 37:23.324
or a leg, and we
pull someone to safety.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.867
And I...
I gave him my breath,

37:25.035 --> 37:28.996
and he opened his eyes,
and he started crying, and...

37:30.999 --> 37:32.791
I mean, the little guy
was alive.

37:35.295 --> 37:36.837
I was a part of that.

37:50.518 --> 37:51.894
I want us to have a baby.

37:54.397 --> 37:55.397
I know.

37:55.565 --> 37:56.941
No, I...

37:57.859 --> 37:59.068
Soon.

37:59.861 --> 38:01.028
Now.

38:14.292 --> 38:16.669
I don't know if I'm ever
gonna want kids.

38:18.797 --> 38:21.465
I want them
because you want them.

38:22.926 --> 38:24.843
But if I'm being honest,
I just...

38:37.649 --> 38:40.651
Sometimes you can
search the entire room,

38:42.570 --> 38:43.946
come up empty.

38:45.073 --> 38:47.700
And you hear about the kid
you missed under the bed.

38:47.867 --> 38:50.285
I'm supposed
to pick up
a Leon Cruz.

38:52.205 --> 38:53.831
Checked himself out
an hour ago.

38:53.999 --> 38:55.457
Left with three guys.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.795
I don't care
who you are.

38:59.963 --> 39:02.881
I don't care how many years
you've had on the job.

39:05.135 --> 39:07.011
You think to yourself,

39:08.471 --> 39:10.055
"How did I miss it?

39:11.933 --> 39:14.643
"How come I didn't reach
just a few feet further?"

39:18.648 --> 39:19.982
I can't do it.

39:22.444 --> 39:23.902
I don't love him.

39:24.446 --> 39:26.739
I mean, I can't have a child
growing up like that.

39:29.576 --> 39:30.993
Come here.

39:38.960 --> 39:40.502
No doubt,

39:40.670 --> 39:42.921
there are days
you want to pick up
your helmet,

39:43.089 --> 39:44.715
and you wanna chuck it
in the lake.

39:45.675 --> 39:47.051
Hey, Shonda.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.095
Yeah, I know
I didn't call Thanksgiving.

39:50.263 --> 39:53.015
I'm calling now, so...

39:56.394 --> 39:58.062
Shonda, please.

39:58.980 --> 40:00.564
Put Jimmy on the phone.

40:13.203 --> 40:17.706
Some days,
you get to see things
that no one gets to see.

40:17.874 --> 40:18.999
Hey, guys, dad's here.

40:19.167 --> 40:20.167
Daddy!
Daddy!

40:20.335 --> 40:21.543
Go say hi.
Hey, what is this?

40:22.921 --> 40:24.171
Hey. Ah!

40:24.923 --> 40:27.883
We thought
we would celebrate
day-after Thanksgiving,

40:28.051 --> 40:29.218
since you were on shift.

40:33.431 --> 40:35.015
That's, uh...

40:36.935 --> 40:38.519
Thanks, guys.

40:39.145 --> 40:42.231
A wife,
grateful you dragged
her husband to safety,

40:43.441 --> 40:46.693
a grown man,
dripping like a faucet
'cause you saved his son.

40:48.071 --> 40:49.988
And every once in a while,

40:51.324 --> 40:53.158
you get to see a baby

40:54.619 --> 40:56.245
take its first breath

40:57.080 --> 40:58.247
in the middle
of a ten-car pileup

40:58.414 --> 41:01.208
with lights and sirens
and a whole group
of firemen standing around

41:01.376 --> 41:03.252
just clapping till it hurts.

41:06.256 --> 41:07.714
Those are good days.

41:14.097 --> 41:15.097
Two shots
of whiskey, please.

41:15.265 --> 41:18.058
Oh, well, well.
The guest of honor.

41:19.060 --> 41:19.810
I heard you were buying.

41:19.978 --> 41:21.145
Ya heard right.

41:22.272 --> 41:23.438
Thank you.

41:27.068 --> 41:28.026
Congratulations.

41:29.279 --> 41:30.654
Thanks.

41:37.078 --> 41:38.120
You okay?

41:40.123 --> 41:41.248
Yeah.

41:42.542 --> 41:43.876
I'm good.

41:48.089 --> 41:50.007
You want to know
what I'm thankful for?

41:51.885 --> 41:53.135
I'm thankful

41:54.929 --> 41:56.847
because I have two families.

41:59.100 --> 42:01.476
And not too many people
