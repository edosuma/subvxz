01:42.019 --> 01:46.107
<i>I open my eyes and I see nothing.</i>

01:50.027 --> 01:53.614
<i>I only remember there was some accident.</i>

01:53.697 --> 01:57.701
<i>Everyone ran for safety
as best they could.</i>

01:58.369 --> 02:00.162
<i>As best they could.</i>

02:00.246 --> 02:06.293
<i>As for what happened to me,
I just can't remember.</i>

02:15.803 --> 02:17.888
<i>How strange. Where am I?</i>

02:19.390 --> 02:22.351
<i>Judging by the clothes,
this must be the 1800s.</i>

02:22.434 --> 02:24.812
<i>Where are they rushing off to?</i>

02:33.112 --> 02:35.739
What if we are denied entry?

02:35.823 --> 02:38.242
I've never been so frightened.

02:41.579 --> 02:43.539
Remember, the girl in white is mine.

02:43.622 --> 02:46.083
Where are you going?

03:01.599 --> 03:03.851
It's cold! Close the doors.

03:33.297 --> 03:34.715
Quickly! Quickly!

03:35.716 --> 03:37.092
Keep moving.

03:52.358 --> 03:56.445
<i>Those officers don't know the way.</i>

04:05.371 --> 04:07.081
<i>Can it be that I'm invisible?</i>

04:07.164 --> 04:09.500
<i>Or do they just not notice me?</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:43.659
<i>Interesting.</i>

04:44.702 --> 04:47.705
<i>Has all this been staged for me?</i>

04:48.455 --> 04:52.042
<i>Am I expected to play a role?</i>

04:59.049 --> 05:01.302
<i>What kind of play is this?</i>

05:03.637 --> 05:06.098
<i>Let's hope it's not a tragedy.</i>

05:22.573 --> 05:24.575
Which way do we go?

05:30.664 --> 05:33.334
Which way do we go?
Maybe this way.

05:33.917 --> 05:36.462
No. We'll go this way.

05:37.254 --> 05:41.842
<i>That man in black,
he's wandering about too.</i>

05:41.925 --> 05:44.011
<i>He nods to me, but goes away.</i>

05:46.472 --> 05:50.351
Pardon me for speaking before
we've been properly introduced.

05:50.434 --> 05:52.269
What city is this?

05:53.312 --> 05:56.690
<i>What city is this?
Well, everyone speaks Russian.</i>

05:56.774 --> 06:00.110
I so hoped this was Chambord
during the Directory.

06:02.363 --> 06:05.032
- What language are we speaking?
- <i>Russian.</i>

06:05.115 --> 06:06.950
Russian?

06:07.034 --> 06:10.371
How strange. I never knew Russian before.

06:11.663 --> 06:14.375
<i>What are they doing in there?</i>

06:18.170 --> 06:20.130
- <i>Shall we go in?</i>
- Where, in there?

06:20.214 --> 06:21.465
<i>Something is going on.</i>

06:21.548 --> 06:24.093
What on earth am I doing here?

06:24.176 --> 06:26.595
I suddenly speak Russian.

06:26.678 --> 06:30.057
I want to leave.
Your curiosity is not amusing.

06:30.140 --> 06:32.559
<i>Could all this be theater?</i>

06:32.643 --> 06:35.437
No, no. Farewell.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.399
No. Our paths must part.

06:38.482 --> 06:42.111
Farewell. You have answered all my questions.

06:42.194 --> 06:45.447
- <i>Farewell then.</i>
- Where does this door lead to?

06:46.990 --> 06:48.659
<i>What a pity.</i>

06:49.701 --> 06:52.454
<i>We may never meet again.</i>

06:58.836 --> 07:01.004
<i>He was obviously a foreigner.</i>

07:03.173 --> 07:06.260
<i>When will an opportunity like that
come again?</i>

07:41.462 --> 07:45.674
<i>It's best not to get involved in this.</i>

07:48.051 --> 07:51.054
<i>Let's not disturb them.</i>

07:53.557 --> 07:58.812
<i>In any case, it's much too late.</i>

08:07.613 --> 08:11.074
<i>Sir. Sir, I'm here.</i>

08:16.246 --> 08:20.501
My Russian cicerone. Do you know the way?

08:20.584 --> 08:23.212
- <i>Yes, let's go together.</i>
- This is your country.

08:23.295 --> 08:27.758
<i>Yes, but not my century.
How did I come to be here?</i>

08:27.841 --> 08:29.676
<i>I think I saw Peter the Great.</i>

08:29.760 --> 08:33.597
I hear delight in your voice.
Was it interesting?

08:34.597 --> 08:37.308
<i>Yes, very interesting.</i>

08:37.768 --> 08:39.686
<i>Really.</i>

08:39.770 --> 08:41.563
In Asia, tyrants are adored.

08:41.647 --> 08:45.692
The more terrible the tyrant,
the more his memory is cherished.

08:45.776 --> 08:49.863
Alexander the Great, Timur
and your Peter the Great.

08:49.947 --> 08:52.032
<i>You're wrong about Peter.</i>

08:52.115 --> 08:56.078
<i>He taught Russians to enjoy themselves.</i>

08:56.161 --> 09:00.082
A spiral staircase.
Where has everyone disappeared to?

09:02.459 --> 09:05.295
I see. But why?

09:05.963 --> 09:08.549
What's so interesting up there?

09:08.632 --> 09:11.218
<i>You'll see.</i>

09:12.511 --> 09:15.806
Peter, the man who ordered
his own son's execution.

09:15.889 --> 09:20.435
The same man who taught the people
to enjoy life. How funny.

09:20.852 --> 09:23.105
<i>I thought you knew where we were going.</i>

09:23.981 --> 09:26.817
He built a European city upon a swamp.

09:26.900 --> 09:30.612
He introduced order of the most primitive kind.

09:30.696 --> 09:33.156
- Where are they going?
- <i>But the city is still European.</i>

09:33.240 --> 09:35.617
To a party. But why by the back staircase?

09:35.701 --> 09:39.246
<i>They were taught to have fun.
So they go to parties.</i>

09:39.329 --> 09:41.415
And the officer and the lady?

09:41.498 --> 09:44.334
- <i>At the party.</i>
- Where are they?

09:44.418 --> 09:47.838
They've gone to the underworld.
Down, down, down!

09:49.047 --> 09:51.049
And they are no more.

09:53.510 --> 09:57.306
Be careful.
The stairs are steep, and it's dark.

09:57.389 --> 09:59.349
<i>Thank you. I can see.</i>

10:04.771 --> 10:07.524
Do you know where we are?

10:08.692 --> 10:11.403
<i>No, I don't know yet.</i>

10:11.862 --> 10:13.614
<i>I don't know yet.</i>

10:38.722 --> 10:41.308
<i>Sir, be careful.</i>

10:41.391 --> 10:43.727
<i>Don't betray our presence.</i>

10:43.810 --> 10:46.688
There's no need to remind me.

10:48.106 --> 10:51.401
Don't forget it was me
who brought you here.

10:51.485 --> 10:53.528
<i>Please don't be offended.</i>

10:53.612 --> 10:56.657
And you, don't get too close
to the actors.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.075
Bend down.

11:00.619 --> 11:02.412
You're beautiful.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.983
- Stop pushing.
- Don't scratch me.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.244
- Why is she pushing me?
- You're pushing too.

11:43.161 --> 11:46.289
What an impressive orchestra.

11:46.957 --> 11:49.376
They must be Europeans.

11:49.876 --> 11:51.878
<i>No, they're Russian musicians.</i>

11:51.962 --> 11:53.630
No, Europeans.

11:54.715 --> 11:55.924
Italians.

11:56.007 --> 11:59.136
<i>They're Russians, for God's sake.</i>

13:08.038 --> 13:09.581
Well?

13:10.373 --> 13:13.710
I say it's good.

13:14.920 --> 13:16.797
Very good!

13:19.132 --> 13:21.426
I need to pee!

13:28.892 --> 13:30.894
I can't hold it in anymore.

14:12.102 --> 14:13.979
No, no.

14:14.980 --> 14:16.898
No. What? What?

14:18.942 --> 14:20.735
Yes. Yes.

14:24.281 --> 14:27.033
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

14:27.367 --> 14:28.618
Don't shout.

14:28.702 --> 14:33.123
- <i>Where are you?</i>
- Here. My God, it's Catherine the Great.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.875
Follow me.

14:38.879 --> 14:44.885
I love the 18th century-
a time of genius and manners.

14:44.968 --> 14:47.721
<i>I would have to agree with you.</i>

14:47.804 --> 14:51.641
- Never contradict me.
- <i>Very well.</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:55.228
Where's the czarina? Gone.

14:55.312 --> 14:59.107
Russia is like a theater. A theater.

14:59.190 --> 15:00.901
<i>Careful.</i>

15:00.984 --> 15:03.987
I think I know where we are.

15:04.821 --> 15:10.076
These petty officials.
How pretentious they are.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.329
Don't lag behind, sir.

15:12.412 --> 15:16.416
<i>I'm not lagging.
I think we're speaking too loudly.</i>

15:16.499 --> 15:19.044
No matter. They're completely deaf.

15:19.920 --> 15:24.799
I'm careful. I won't touch anyone.

15:24.883 --> 15:26.635
It's all theater.

15:26.718 --> 15:31.264
What actors. And what costumes.

15:37.020 --> 15:40.440
Thank you, sirs. Thank you.

15:40.523 --> 15:43.568
They don't see me.
They don't see me.

15:49.908 --> 15:52.619
Just like the Vatican.

15:52.702 --> 15:55.372
Truly. It's like we're in the Vatican.

15:58.625 --> 16:02.295
Those reliefs are painted, are they not?

16:02.379 --> 16:04.798
What naturalism.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.216
Look at them.

16:06.299 --> 16:10.220
Weren't those decorations inspired
by sketches of Raphael?

16:10.303 --> 16:11.972
<i>Raphael, yes.</i>

16:14.808 --> 16:17.477
<i>Better than the Vatican.
This is St. Petersburg.</i>

16:17.560 --> 16:19.354
So they're copies?

16:19.437 --> 16:23.066
Your authorities don't have faith
in your own artists.

16:24.067 --> 16:28.029
Russians are so talented at copying.

16:28.113 --> 16:30.156
And why?

16:30.240 --> 16:32.993
Because you don't have ideas of your own.

16:33.785 --> 16:38.415
Your authorities don't want you
to have them.

16:38.498 --> 16:42.335
In fact, they are as lazy
as all the rest of you.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.005
Just lazy.

16:45.088 --> 16:46.381
<i>Lazy.</i>

16:46.464 --> 16:50.427
There was a gallery there for paintings.

16:50.510 --> 16:55.181
- <i>On the upper floor.</i>
- 111 paintings- Italian masters.

16:55.265 --> 16:58.476
- True, not the best masters.
- <i>Not the best.</i>

16:59.686 --> 17:03.231
<i>The czars were mainly Russophiles.</i>

17:07.777 --> 17:10.195
<i>But they dreamed of Italy.</i>

17:10.280 --> 17:13.074
<i>Wasn't the Hermitage created
to satisfy those dreams?</i>

17:15.285 --> 17:18.079
- Raphael isn't for you.
- <i>Not for us.</i>

17:18.163 --> 17:19.789
For Italy.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.499
It's warm there.

17:22.125 --> 17:23.667
<i>It's warm there.</i>

17:28.840 --> 17:30.800
What beauty.

17:37.015 --> 17:40.393
The small Italian gallery.

17:40.477 --> 17:43.229
<i>The small Italian gallery.</i>

17:48.985 --> 17:50.779
Who are these people?

17:52.363 --> 17:55.575
From which era are they from?

17:55.658 --> 17:57.243
<i>Do you see that vase?</i>

17:57.327 --> 18:00.580
I see. I see.
Empire style is everywhere.

18:00.663 --> 18:02.415
<i>And those Voronikhin lamps.</i>

18:02.499 --> 18:04.918
<i>Lamps, lamps, lamps.</i>

18:06.419 --> 18:08.296
Empire. Empire. Empire.

18:08.379 --> 18:11.633
I have no enthusiasm for Empire style.

18:11.716 --> 18:13.635
That style is too silly.

18:15.678 --> 18:20.683
Don't forget it was born under Bonaparte.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.435
Then it became fashionable here

18:22.519 --> 18:26.272
to the point of becoming
the national style

18:26.356 --> 18:28.942
to the detriment of its originality.

18:29.025 --> 18:31.236
<i>We battled Napoleon, not the Empire style.</i>

18:31.736 --> 18:35.615
Who are they? Who are these people?

18:35.698 --> 18:39.953
<i>The people of St. Petersburg,
after the city ceased being the capital.</i>

18:40.036 --> 18:41.704
It's better that way.

18:41.788 --> 18:45.792
A capital city should be an ancient city,
not chimerical.

18:45.875 --> 18:49.295
Like Moscow. Who are these people?

18:49.379 --> 18:51.131
<i>Should I introduce you?</i>

18:51.214 --> 18:54.300
- Only if it's not impolite.
- <i>No, they are friends.</i>

18:54.384 --> 18:55.677
Then let's.

18:55.760 --> 18:58.847
<i>This is Oleg Konstantinovich,
professor of medicine.</i>

18:58.930 --> 19:00.598
<i>Lev Mikhailovich, actor.</i>

19:01.391 --> 19:02.976
Shouldn't they rise?

19:03.059 --> 19:06.396
<i>This is my European friend.
He is visiting Russia.</i>

19:06.479 --> 19:08.857
- My pleasure.
- <i>He's European.</i>

19:12.610 --> 19:16.322
Medicine is a fine profession.

19:16.406 --> 19:19.868
I haven't spoken to anyone for a long time

19:19.951 --> 19:22.704
aside from my new companion.

19:22.787 --> 19:25.707
Such a long time. What is that odor?

19:25.790 --> 19:27.417
<i>What odor?</i>

19:27.500 --> 19:29.335
A curious odor.

19:31.588 --> 19:35.091
- Have you been in St. Petersburg long?
- For an hour.

19:35.175 --> 19:37.177
And you came straight here?

19:37.260 --> 19:41.431
- I had my reasons.
- You must love art.

19:41.514 --> 19:45.685
Are you interested in beauty
or just its representation?

19:45.768 --> 19:49.522
- No, Marquis. We're here to rest.
- <i>"Marquis"?</i>

19:49.606 --> 19:52.066
- This is how you rest?
- Just so.

19:52.150 --> 19:55.612
Today, Oleg Konstantinovich
and I have come here-

19:55.695 --> 19:57.363
It smells of formaldehyde.

19:57.447 --> 19:59.282
<i>Yes, formaldehyde.</i>

19:59.365 --> 20:02.202
Marquis, I'll show you a splendid painting.

20:02.285 --> 20:05.622
These men are emitting a very strange odor.

20:05.705 --> 20:10.501
Marquis, this is the
<i>Birth of John the Baptist.</i>

20:15.298 --> 20:18.134
The marquis smells of formaldehyde.

20:18.218 --> 20:22.555
I know this painting.
I saw it on my last visit here.

20:22.639 --> 20:25.558
It comes from Paris,
from the Crozat collection.

20:25.642 --> 20:30.521
Catherine acquired it in 1772.

20:30.813 --> 20:34.067
One of the earliest pieces
of the Hermitage collection.

20:34.150 --> 20:38.404
Such information, that's for specialists.

20:38.488 --> 20:41.616
For us, the details are more interesting.

20:41.699 --> 20:43.743
Look closely here.

20:43.826 --> 20:47.830
See in the foreground?
A chicken and a cat.

20:48.373 --> 20:51.626
They are symbolic figures.

20:51.709 --> 20:54.837
The chicken represents greed, avarice.

20:54.921 --> 20:58.591
The cat- cynicism and cruelty.

20:58.675 --> 21:01.844
<i>Cynicism and cruelty. The cat.</i>

21:01.928 --> 21:04.097
They are both calmed by the birth of John.

21:04.180 --> 21:05.890
How interesting.

21:07.684 --> 21:09.519
Very, very interesting.

21:09.602 --> 21:11.854
Why is he dressed like that?

21:12.730 --> 21:16.776
For example, the Cleopatra-
what do you know about it?

21:16.859 --> 21:18.611
Massimo Stanzione.

21:19.862 --> 21:23.491
The Cleopatra is on the same wall

21:23.574 --> 21:27.036
as the <i>Circumcision of Christ</i>
by the pious Ludovico Cardi.

21:27.120 --> 21:30.623
- What bothers you?
- What bothers me?

21:30.707 --> 21:35.795
Right next to <i>Saint Cecilia?</i>
Can you imagine!

21:35.878 --> 21:37.964
By Carlo Dolci.

21:38.047 --> 21:41.050
And next to an <i>Eastern Still Life!</i>

21:41.134 --> 21:44.554
- Why does that bother you?
- Don't argue, Oleg.

21:44.637 --> 21:49.142
As a Catholic, that shocks me.

21:49.434 --> 21:51.477
What do you think of Wagner?

21:51.561 --> 21:53.730
Wagner? Who is Wagner?

21:53.813 --> 21:56.190
Oleg, he doesn't know Wagner.

21:57.275 --> 22:03.281
Wagner is that child who behaved badly
with my best friend, Meyerbeer.

22:04.574 --> 22:07.577
I have never listened to Wagner.

22:07.660 --> 22:11.497
- Broaden your horizons.
- That doctor is so insistent.

22:11.581 --> 22:16.002
- But I'm not sick.
- We wish you much success.

22:16.085 --> 22:18.838
Sir, why are they badly dressed?

22:18.921 --> 22:24.260
<i>My friends, how could I think
that you would get along?</i>

22:24.344 --> 22:28.848
<i>One day, I'll explain everything.
I'm in a strange situation.</i>

22:28.931 --> 22:32.685
<i>Sir. Sir, why quarrel with everyone?</i>

22:32.769 --> 22:36.939
<i>If you do, we will never discover
why we are here.</i>

22:37.023 --> 22:39.567
Such clothing kills a man's creative essence.

22:42.278 --> 22:46.074
Why do you find it necessary
to adopt European culture?

22:46.157 --> 22:48.117
For what reason?

22:48.201 --> 22:52.872
Why borrow also Europe's mistakes?

22:54.832 --> 22:57.752
My God. What is all this?

22:57.835 --> 23:00.546
What is it?

23:03.299 --> 23:04.717
Mother!

23:05.343 --> 23:06.803
Mother.

23:14.185 --> 23:15.728
Canova!

23:15.812 --> 23:19.816
What a sublime approach to art!

23:19.899 --> 23:21.859
What feeling for the material!

23:23.319 --> 23:25.238
How wonderful!

23:25.321 --> 23:27.281
How wonderful. My God.

23:27.365 --> 23:30.576
He is a true heir to the masters of antiquity.

23:31.828 --> 23:34.747
Canova almost married my mother.

23:34.831 --> 23:37.583
<i>Was your mother a sculptress?</i>

23:37.667 --> 23:40.002
Yes, a sculptress. In Rome.

23:40.086 --> 23:43.923
<i>In Rome? Your mother, a sculptress.</i>

23:44.006 --> 23:49.429
In this Canova collection,
there are even sculptures

23:49.512 --> 23:52.682
that Czar Alexander bought from the wife-

23:52.765 --> 23:54.350
<i>The wife of Napoleon?</i>

23:54.434 --> 23:58.604
Yes. It was 1815,
I was at the Congress of Vienna.

23:58.688 --> 24:00.314
<i>What were you doing there?</i>

24:00.398 --> 24:04.110
- I was a diplomat.
- <i>You were a diplomat?</i>

24:04.193 --> 24:07.363
This collection was the object
of a serious dispute.

24:08.906 --> 24:11.534
Look where we are now.

24:13.202 --> 24:15.788
<i>Is this a dream?</i>

24:15.872 --> 24:18.666
I don't know. I don't know.

24:20.251 --> 24:23.171
I don't know about you,
but I'm wide awake.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.677
It's amazing how well I speak Russian.

24:32.930 --> 24:34.474
<i>Yes, quite well.</i>

24:34.557 --> 24:37.810
Who was that small man?

24:37.894 --> 24:39.729
Was that Pushkin?

24:41.606 --> 24:43.691
- Good day.
- Good day.

24:44.108 --> 24:47.820
Is that your great poet?
Your beloved one?

24:47.904 --> 24:51.699
I read him in French. Nothing special.

24:51.782 --> 24:53.326
<i>Sir.</i>

24:53.409 --> 24:56.412
My God, how touchy you are.

24:56.496 --> 24:59.707
Forgive me, please.

25:00.833 --> 25:04.712
I'm sorry if I've offended
your nationalist sympathies.

25:04.795 --> 25:08.758
"Nationalist sympathies." What is that?

25:13.471 --> 25:15.515
What's that there?

25:15.598 --> 25:18.851
- <i>Sir. Please.</i>
- Who is that?

25:18.935 --> 25:20.520
<i>Please don't be rash.</i>

25:20.603 --> 25:23.022
All alone, without a chaperone?

25:23.105 --> 25:26.692
<i>It would be wiser not to talk to that lady.</i>

25:29.278 --> 25:30.947
<i>Don't bother her.</i>

25:32.657 --> 25:34.534
<i>Let's move along.</i>

25:46.170 --> 25:50.716
Excuse me, madam.
Have you lost your guide?

25:51.801 --> 25:54.554
Thank you for asking,
but I know this place well.

25:55.846 --> 25:59.058
Of course. Do you work here?

26:00.393 --> 26:04.730
Not at all. I'm here to admire
the works of the old masters.

26:08.484 --> 26:12.822
Would you accompany me
into the next salon?

26:13.197 --> 26:15.616
To see the Flemish masters?

26:19.662 --> 26:23.666
With pleasure. Your slender fingers see all.

26:23.749 --> 26:27.795
- 140 paces, straight ahead.
- 140 paces. Is that so?

26:29.672 --> 26:32.633
How many are left?

26:35.886 --> 26:38.389
Watch your step.

26:45.187 --> 26:47.273
This way.

26:53.779 --> 26:56.324
How dare you! Quiet!

27:11.380 --> 27:14.175
- We're here.
- Yes, We're here.

27:15.426 --> 27:18.971
Can we go closer to that painting?

27:19.055 --> 27:21.766
Would you like me to tell you about it?

27:22.808 --> 27:26.854
<i>Virgin with Partridges</i> by Van Dyck.

27:26.937 --> 27:30.691
Catherine II acquired it.

27:30.775 --> 27:34.236
Would you like to tell me
about this painting?

27:34.320 --> 27:36.322
Please, tell me.

27:37.239 --> 27:40.534
See the calm and serenity
around the Madonna and Joseph.

27:40.618 --> 27:44.372
- Joseph, yes.
- God protects them.

27:44.455 --> 27:48.834
There is no doubt about His unseen presence.

27:48.918 --> 27:52.505
The apple tree represents life.
Sunflowers stand for piety.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.509
On the upper right,
partridges symbolize frivolity.

27:56.592 --> 27:58.844
- They're flying away.
- Partridges.

27:58.928 --> 28:01.389
Angels dance and play.

28:01.472 --> 28:04.183
So many other symbols
that we can only guess about.

28:04.266 --> 28:08.354
<i>Sir, leave her be. She's an angel.</i>

28:22.785 --> 28:25.746
Why have you gone quiet?

28:25.830 --> 28:31.127
The partridges, the children, the Madonna.

28:33.045 --> 28:36.465
Thank you, madam. Thank you.

28:36.549 --> 28:41.846
I highly value your opinion
on the works of Van Dyck.

28:43.639 --> 28:46.726
You'll definitely be interested
in another painting.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.561
<i>Be very careful.</i>

28:48.644 --> 28:50.271
A Rubens.

28:51.731 --> 28:55.651
Sir, do not disturb me.

28:58.571 --> 29:01.782
<i>Feast in the House of Simon the Pharisee.</i>

29:04.076 --> 29:06.954
- Seventeen.
- I don't see it.

29:07.037 --> 29:10.916
- Eighteen.
- Where is it?

29:19.341 --> 29:21.719
The painting isn't here.

29:26.182 --> 29:29.310
No, that painting isn't here.

29:36.358 --> 29:39.695
It wasn't in the czar's collection.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.575
Yes, it's here.

29:45.367 --> 29:49.121
That particular Rubens is not here.

29:49.205 --> 29:52.500
Yes. It was from Lord Walpole's collection.

29:52.583 --> 29:54.543
Like the <i>Virgin with Partridges.</i>

29:54.627 --> 29:56.545
But that Rubens isn't on exhibit.

29:58.297 --> 29:59.840
But it's here.

30:10.768 --> 30:14.355
- Where are you?
- What a wonderful scent.

30:14.438 --> 30:16.357
The scent of oils.

30:17.566 --> 30:19.318
<i>Sir.</i>

30:19.401 --> 30:22.988
<i>Sir, let's leave here now.
Let's leave.</i>

30:23.072 --> 30:25.449
- Where are you?
- No, let's stay a while.

30:29.245 --> 30:32.498
What wonderful paintings.

30:33.916 --> 30:37.127
What are those men counting?

30:39.255 --> 30:42.591
You were right. I found it.

30:44.760 --> 30:48.681
Let's take a closer look.
There it is.

30:51.684 --> 30:54.687
We're almost there.

30:54.770 --> 30:57.565
Face the painting directly.

30:57.648 --> 31:00.317
There it is. There's the painting.

31:03.362 --> 31:07.449
Yes, there it is.

31:07.533 --> 31:10.202
Something to say about Rubens?

31:10.286 --> 31:11.745
Van Dyck.

31:11.829 --> 31:15.332
Rubens considered Van Dyck
to be his best pupil.

31:16.333 --> 31:20.462
You know, there was a time
when all these paintings

31:20.546 --> 31:22.631
were placed much higher
and much closer to one another.

31:24.133 --> 31:26.552
The czar himself supervised
how they were hung.

31:27.970 --> 31:30.139
Who are you?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.099
I'm a sailor.

31:32.182 --> 31:35.144
- What are those insignias?
- Navy.

31:35.227 --> 31:38.606
The czar visited his collection every morning.

31:38.689 --> 31:44.194
He himself saved all this during the fire.

31:44.695 --> 31:48.115
- Which fire?
- The fire was in 1800-

31:51.493 --> 31:52.786
Are you asking me?

31:52.870 --> 31:55.414
Enough, let's go.

32:00.044 --> 32:01.837
It's time for me to go.

32:01.921 --> 32:03.255
May I accompany you?

32:03.339 --> 32:04.798
No. No.

32:05.424 --> 32:07.676
What a pity.

32:07.760 --> 32:11.680
I must ask you to leave.

32:11.764 --> 32:13.641
The museum is closing.

32:13.724 --> 32:16.852
Please see yourself to the exit.

32:19.104 --> 32:22.816
Quiet. Close the doors.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.154
The museum is closing.

33:40.811 --> 33:44.523
- How was my scene?
- <i>I wasn't impressed.</i>

33:46.358 --> 33:48.277
I was joking.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.698
<i>Joking.</i>

34:10.882 --> 34:14.303
- <i>Do you hear music?</i>
- I hear something.

34:26.148 --> 34:30.069
Russian music makes me break out in hives.

34:31.487 --> 34:33.655
<i>That has nothing to do with the music.</i>

35:01.350 --> 35:03.435
<i>Why do you look at me like that?</i>

35:19.743 --> 35:22.621
Rags. A dog.

35:24.706 --> 35:26.542
Eternal people.

35:28.460 --> 35:32.714
So, live on. Live on.

35:33.549 --> 35:36.260
- You'll outlive them all.
- <i>Eternal people.</i>

35:44.768 --> 35:46.937
What are you doing?

35:48.063 --> 35:49.940
Eavesdropping?

35:54.486 --> 35:57.197
Are you interested in painting?

36:00.909 --> 36:02.828
What nice small hands.

36:06.915 --> 36:08.542
Stay away from me.

36:42.868 --> 36:45.037
Amen. Amen.

36:46.997 --> 36:48.707
Beautiful, isn't it?

36:48.790 --> 36:51.460
Beautiful. Beautiful.

36:51.543 --> 36:55.422
- Are you Catholic?
- No, I'm not Catholic.

36:57.007 --> 36:58.967
Why do you ask?

37:00.886 --> 37:03.764
It seemed to me that you were deep in thought

37:03.847 --> 37:08.227
while admiring these images
of the founders of our Church.

37:08.310 --> 37:10.479
I don't know.

37:10.562 --> 37:12.564
I wasn't thinking about that.

37:14.316 --> 37:15.984
You weren't thinking.

37:16.902 --> 37:21.865
Do you know that those are
the apostles Peter and Paul?

37:22.658 --> 37:25.577
Yes, that's what someone said.

37:25.661 --> 37:28.205
That's what they said?

37:29.331 --> 37:31.250
And so?

37:36.672 --> 37:40.425
I was looking at them
because it gives me joy.

37:40.509 --> 37:42.177
Gives you joy-

37:42.261 --> 37:47.349
One day, all men will become like them.

37:47.432 --> 37:48.892
Really?

37:52.354 --> 37:57.734
How can you know what will become of people

37:59.528 --> 38:04.157
if you don't know the Scriptures?

38:16.795 --> 38:18.755
Why aren't you saying anything?

38:27.723 --> 38:29.725
Look at their hands.

38:34.479 --> 38:38.108
The hands are beautiful. So?

38:45.073 --> 38:48.660
How can you know what will become of people

38:48.744 --> 38:50.662
if you don't know the Scriptures?

38:50.746 --> 38:55.375
As for you, they're just two dusty old men.

38:56.501 --> 38:59.504
Just flesh.

38:59.588 --> 39:02.341
They're covered with the dust of the road

39:02.424 --> 39:04.343
as they appear in the painting.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.598
- <i>What happened?</i>
- They are good and wise.

39:09.681 --> 39:12.851
How could you know what they're like

39:12.934 --> 39:15.020
if you have not read the Gospels?

39:15.103 --> 39:17.356
How could you know all that?

39:17.439 --> 39:21.693
<i>Sir, why are you frightening him?
He was already afraid.</i>

39:21.777 --> 39:23.737
He's not afraid.

39:23.820 --> 39:26.531
- These people are never afraid.
- <i>Leave him be.</i>

39:26.615 --> 39:29.368
<i>Better to appreciate the scent of the paintings.</i>

39:31.161 --> 39:33.163
<i>It smells good.</i>

39:43.465 --> 39:45.384
Only you're not afraid of anything.

39:46.468 --> 39:51.139
So strange to hear those words.

39:51.223 --> 39:54.768
Now I understand. We're in the gallery.

39:54.851 --> 39:57.312
Yes, yes, yes.

39:58.480 --> 40:00.732
I understand.

40:01.650 --> 40:04.236
We're in the czar's gallery

40:04.319 --> 40:07.322
near the portrait of a medieval fanatic.

40:08.156 --> 40:10.992
Where have we wandered to?

40:14.329 --> 40:17.124
That music was good, after all.

40:17.207 --> 40:19.793
- Who was the composer?
- <i>Glinka.</i>

40:19.876 --> 40:21.795
Glinka? A German.

40:21.878 --> 40:23.338
<i>A Russian.</i>

40:23.422 --> 40:26.842
A German. All composers are German.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.302
<i>All composers are German.</i>

40:43.692 --> 40:45.485
El Greco.

40:55.704 --> 40:57.706
Very nice.

40:57.789 --> 41:00.876
Looks like a Rembrandt.

41:03.462 --> 41:06.131
El Greco. Dust from the road.

41:06.214 --> 41:09.593
What dust from the road?

41:16.391 --> 41:18.643
Nice, very nice.

41:18.727 --> 41:21.021
- <i>Something you don't like?</i>
- Not at all.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.981
It's nice, very nice.

41:23.064 --> 41:24.983
<i>Nice, very nice.</i>

41:25.066 --> 41:28.487
More flesh. Very nice.

41:32.908 --> 41:35.827
These are nice paintings.

41:36.578 --> 41:38.330
<i>Nice paintings.</i>

41:38.413 --> 41:41.291
They're getting better and better.

41:52.761 --> 41:54.679
<i>There's an angel.</i>

42:30.674 --> 42:35.136
Pardon me for addressing you
without an introduction.

42:35.220 --> 42:37.597
- To whom was that directed?
- What?

42:37.681 --> 42:40.308
- To whom was that directed?
- What?

42:40.392 --> 42:41.935
Do tell.

42:42.018 --> 42:45.897
- I'm speaking to the painting.
- Speaking to-

42:45.981 --> 42:48.733
Yes. How interesting.

42:48.817 --> 42:52.904
- I must express myself.
- Do continue.

42:52.988 --> 42:55.865
That's how to communicate with it.

42:56.533 --> 42:58.243
Would you like to try?

42:58.326 --> 43:02.914
I should try? Very well.

43:06.876 --> 43:09.129
- Like that.
- Like this?

43:11.172 --> 43:12.841
Now like this.

43:14.217 --> 43:16.761
Now a turn.

43:20.682 --> 43:22.392
And like this.

43:25.353 --> 43:29.190
Sometimes I prefer to speak alone.

43:32.193 --> 43:37.949
This painting and I, we have a secret.

43:40.910 --> 43:42.954
Really?

43:43.038 --> 43:44.664
- Yes.
- Now it's over.

43:46.291 --> 43:49.794
That's all, gentlemen.
Good-bye. Good-bye.

43:51.713 --> 43:54.382
Where are you going, madam?

43:56.551 --> 44:00.555
She's offended. She has left.

44:01.723 --> 44:03.391
She's left.

44:13.318 --> 44:16.196
- Hello.
- Hello, hello.

44:17.405 --> 44:19.240
Good-bye. Good-bye.

44:25.163 --> 44:27.040
Farewell, gentleman.

44:27.123 --> 44:29.000
How charming!

44:31.336 --> 44:34.673
She's offended. But so charming.

44:42.514 --> 44:44.891
Where has she gone?

46:54.938 --> 46:56.856
Marble.

46:58.233 --> 47:00.109
White, white...

47:01.402 --> 47:03.071
stone.

47:04.572 --> 47:06.908
It's cold, isn't it?

47:06.991 --> 47:10.829
<i>When you first came here,
it must have been a disaster.</i>

47:10.912 --> 47:13.832
<i>That was just after the fire.</i>

47:13.915 --> 47:17.252
I have been here before,
but it's as if I have not.

47:17.335 --> 47:19.254
What luxury.

47:23.258 --> 47:24.926
What is that?

47:25.260 --> 47:29.347
It was under the Convention
that everything was devastated.

47:29.430 --> 47:33.101
<i>You don't know 20th-century Russian history.</i>

47:33.184 --> 47:36.521
<i>Our Convention lasted 80 years.</i>

47:36.604 --> 47:40.149
<i>A real revolution. Very sad.</i>

47:41.526 --> 47:45.697
What kind of system is there now?
A republic?

47:45.780 --> 47:47.657
<i>I don't know.</i>

47:48.283 --> 47:51.911
I have never believed
that a republic was suitable

47:51.995 --> 47:54.747
for a country as large as Russia.

47:54.831 --> 47:58.209
<i>You Europeans are democrats
who mourn the monarchy.</i>

47:58.293 --> 47:59.794
You are French, is that it?

47:59.878 --> 48:02.171
- Stop. Who are you?
- And who are you?

48:05.049 --> 48:06.968
Excuse us. We're lost.

48:07.051 --> 48:09.470
- Please be on your way.
- Spare us! Spare us!

48:09.554 --> 48:13.391
- You are forbidden here.
- Help us, please.

48:13.474 --> 48:16.477
Who forbids it? What is forbidden?

48:16.561 --> 48:19.898
What language. Everything is forbidden.

48:19.981 --> 48:22.400
<i>It's better not to argue. Let's leave.</i>

48:22.984 --> 48:25.069
We're going, We're going.

48:27.989 --> 48:30.283
<i>I know where we can hide.</i>

48:30.366 --> 48:33.995
I suddenly feel afraid.
I don't like military uniforms.

48:37.874 --> 48:42.253
- <i>Don't rush.</i>
- There's a door ahead.

48:43.254 --> 48:45.173
<i>Not that door, sir.</i>

48:45.256 --> 48:49.802
But I like it. Such a beautiful door.

48:49.886 --> 48:52.055
<i>No, not that one.</i>

48:56.017 --> 48:57.852
I have never been here.

48:58.686 --> 49:00.688
Why is it so cold?

49:00.772 --> 49:03.775
<i>I told you not to enter.</i>

49:03.858 --> 49:05.318
What cold!

49:05.401 --> 49:07.236
Frames. But where are-

49:09.948 --> 49:12.617
Where are the canvases?

49:14.118 --> 49:17.288
<i>Let's go back, I beg you.</i>

49:17.372 --> 49:20.333
- Who's there?
- It's me.

49:20.416 --> 49:23.252
- What's happening?
- Nothing. I simply entered.

49:26.547 --> 49:28.466
- Come closer.
- I'm coming.

49:28.549 --> 49:33.304
Maybe you need help, kind sir.
Maybe I can help.

49:33.388 --> 49:34.847
What?

49:35.223 --> 49:37.475
Who is the "kind sir"?

49:37.558 --> 49:39.602
Me. You.

49:41.062 --> 49:43.648
Not here, not there.

49:43.731 --> 49:45.358
There is no one.

49:45.441 --> 49:47.735
Only coffins and corpses.

49:47.819 --> 49:50.029
Only coffins and corpses.
Come and see.

49:50.113 --> 49:53.825
- I'm coming.
- That's my coffin.

49:53.908 --> 49:56.869
- Your coffin?
- Yes, I made it myself.

49:56.953 --> 50:01.165
Why that strange tone, kind sir?

50:01.249 --> 50:03.918
Why are there coffins in the Hermitage?

50:04.002 --> 50:05.670
Kind sir.

50:06.921 --> 50:09.382
- It's my coffin.
- Your coffin?

50:09.465 --> 50:13.386
- It's my coffin.
- Yours. All right.

50:13.594 --> 50:16.431
- He looks well-fed.
- But where are the corpses?

50:16.514 --> 50:19.392
Why do you ask where?
Don't step on the corpses.

50:19.475 --> 50:22.603
He looks well-fed.
You stepped on the corpses!

50:23.146 --> 50:25.231
- What happened?
- <i>A war.</i>

50:25.314 --> 50:27.442
- What?
- <i>A war.</i>

50:27.984 --> 50:30.361
Which war? Against whom?

50:30.445 --> 50:33.656
- <i>Against Germany.</i>
- Germany? What is this "Germany"?

50:34.657 --> 50:37.827
<i>The unified German state.</i>

50:38.286 --> 50:42.040
<i>In the 20th century,
Russia was at war with Germany.</i>

50:42.957 --> 50:47.336
<i>The German army surrounded the city,
but the city did not surrender.</i>

50:48.296 --> 50:50.214
<i>More than one million people died.</i>

50:50.298 --> 50:53.718
- What? More than one million?
- <i>More than one million.</i>

50:53.801 --> 50:56.220
That's a high price to pay.

50:57.805 --> 50:59.932
Very high.

51:00.016 --> 51:03.269
St. Petersburg and the Hermitage paid dearly.

51:03.352 --> 51:05.980
<i>In Russia, it is said
that freedom knows no price.</i>

51:06.064 --> 51:08.566
- A very high price.
- <i>Certainly high.</i>

51:08.649 --> 51:10.818
But maybe not so high.

51:10.902 --> 51:14.280
- <i>But it's already been paid.</i>
- All the same, I was wrong.

51:14.363 --> 51:16.908
I was wrong

51:16.991 --> 51:19.911
when I criticized your czars

51:19.994 --> 51:24.582
for all this beauty and opulence.

51:24.665 --> 51:30.296
Even if they all were... tyrants.

51:30.379 --> 51:32.673
<i>Please. Not so loud.</i>

51:37.345 --> 51:40.389
But it is beautiful, isn't it?

51:41.516 --> 51:45.561
What do you see? Who is it?

51:47.939 --> 51:52.485
<i>I'm not sure. Maybe Catherine.</i>

51:54.529 --> 51:57.031
<i>Nothing could be less sure.</i>

51:58.199 --> 52:01.577
That's enough. Lisa, bring the children.

52:03.204 --> 52:05.331
Don't go too near her.

52:05.414 --> 52:09.460
If it is Catherine, she has a sixth sense.

52:14.715 --> 52:17.802
Like this.

52:19.887 --> 52:21.305
Lower. Lower.

52:22.390 --> 52:24.433
That will be all.

52:28.271 --> 52:30.731
The candles. The candles.

52:31.732 --> 52:33.401
It's stuffy in here.

52:34.944 --> 52:37.446
- There?
- Over here.

52:38.447 --> 52:39.907
Over here.

52:40.783 --> 52:45.663
No, benefactress, not there.
It's much too cold.

52:51.586 --> 52:54.714
Just so. Just so.

52:56.799 --> 52:58.718
But it's cold.

53:28.039 --> 53:29.582
Sir!

53:30.791 --> 53:32.710
Where are you?

53:33.669 --> 53:36.422
I hear your footsteps.
Where are you?

53:44.555 --> 53:48.059
Mortals should not chase after royalty.

53:52.521 --> 53:54.482
Careful not to catch up with her.

54:27.431 --> 54:30.351
I hear your footsteps.

54:30.434 --> 54:32.311
I hear them.

54:36.399 --> 54:40.611
Sir, what are you doing? It's cold.

54:41.779 --> 54:43.823
- Come this way.
- <i>Yes, it's cold.</i>

54:43.906 --> 54:45.449
Come on, let's go.

54:45.533 --> 54:47.785
- <i>She disappeared.</i>
- I know.

54:47.868 --> 54:50.621
- <i>She disappeared again.</i>
- Move aside.

54:50.705 --> 54:54.458
- <i>Do you know where to go?</i>
- Help us.

54:54.542 --> 54:57.169
- Come on, let's go.
- <i>Isn't he letting us in?</i>

54:57.253 --> 54:59.297
Let us through. We are allowed.

55:00.923 --> 55:03.718
Where is the door? Where is it?

55:05.261 --> 55:06.971
Greetings.

55:07.054 --> 55:10.933
Don't be shy. Come.
We won't stay long.

55:11.559 --> 55:13.561
Where are you taking me?

55:13.644 --> 55:17.189
Thank you very much.
A new hairstyle is necessary.

55:17.273 --> 55:20.693
<i>What beautiful hair you have.
Those curls!</i>

55:20.776 --> 55:22.862
Thank you.

55:22.945 --> 55:25.990
They're offering us tea.
Will you have tea?

55:27.950 --> 55:32.038
I don't want any, but they insist.
Where is the tea?

55:32.121 --> 55:34.373
We're in a hurry. Where is it?

55:34.457 --> 55:37.835
- I know I'm beautiful.
- Too beautiful.

55:37.918 --> 55:41.630
What do you want me to say?
What can I say?

55:44.091 --> 55:47.345
No, no! I can't explain.

55:47.428 --> 55:50.222
I have nothing to say.
What is this?

55:50.306 --> 55:55.061
- Did you write this book?
- Not me. He did.

55:55.144 --> 55:59.648
Neither he nor I.
But he will dedicate it.

56:01.108 --> 56:02.735
Follow me.

56:04.820 --> 56:08.240
<i>Sir, what are you looking at?
Shall we continue?</i>

56:08.324 --> 56:11.452
What do I see?
Nothing for the moment.

56:12.286 --> 56:14.538
Some people are obviously waiting for something.

56:14.622 --> 56:17.041
Let's proceed with caution.

56:17.124 --> 56:22.213
- These madmen could eat us.
- <i>They liked your hair.</i>

56:22.296 --> 56:26.634
Of course. I'm a writer.
Good writers always have beautiful hair.

56:27.301 --> 56:31.430
- Be more careful and quiet now.
- <i>I'm following you.</i>

56:31.514 --> 56:36.435
- Close the doors quickly.
- <i>The doors are closed.</i>

56:38.813 --> 56:44.235
When I was last received here
at the Winter Palace,

56:44.318 --> 56:48.948
it was being renovated
after the terrible fire.

56:50.825 --> 56:53.411
The parquet doesn't creak.

57:02.753 --> 57:08.092
- The ambassador of Persia!
- Excuse us for being late.

57:08.175 --> 57:10.136
Let's go, let's go.

57:13.347 --> 57:16.934
The ambassador of His Highness the Shah.

57:17.017 --> 57:18.644
Excuse us. Excuse us.

57:18.727 --> 57:20.521
Excuse us. Excuse us.

57:20.604 --> 57:24.358
Prince Khozrow Mirza,

57:24.442 --> 57:27.278
son of the future shah,
with his entourage.

57:27.361 --> 57:30.823
- Do you know what is happening?
- <i>No.</i>

57:34.285 --> 57:38.289
We're watching Nicholas I

57:38.372 --> 57:42.168
as he receives an apology
from the Persian emissaries

57:42.251 --> 57:45.880
regarding the murder of Russian diplomats.

57:45.963 --> 57:47.631
Griboedov was one, I think.

57:47.715 --> 57:49.216
Excuse us.

57:49.300 --> 57:51.302
How interesting.

57:52.803 --> 57:54.972
Are you able to see?

57:55.055 --> 57:57.141
What uniforms.

57:59.143 --> 58:01.479
Luxury. Empire.

58:02.480 --> 58:04.607
Power.

58:05.274 --> 58:07.860
Look over there. Up ahead.

58:07.943 --> 58:10.029
Get up on your tiptoes.

58:11.238 --> 58:12.907
Can you see?

58:13.282 --> 58:16.827
<i>Yes, I see now.</i>

58:16.911 --> 58:20.831
One must not trust this world.
You are right.

58:30.299 --> 58:32.218
Beware.

58:32.301 --> 58:35.554
Court officials are cunning.

58:35.638 --> 58:38.349
Some of them are mediums.

58:38.432 --> 58:41.185
They can sense your presence.

58:41.268 --> 58:45.356
<i>Thank you for your advice.
We Geminis are curious by nature.</i>

58:45.439 --> 58:49.860
I'll go ahead. Maybe I'll meet
some of my old acquaintances.

58:49.944 --> 58:51.904
<i>Good luck. I'll find you later.</i>

59:48.252 --> 59:49.920
He's so young.

01:00:02.891 --> 01:00:05.477
"Mighty Sovereign Emperor,

01:00:05.561 --> 01:00:10.441
the peaceful nature of Persia
and the sacred union that exists

01:00:10.524 --> 01:00:13.902
among His Majesty and the shah
both were upset by evil.

01:00:14.862 --> 01:00:17.531
Under the influence of this power,
a frenzied Tehran crowd

01:00:17.615 --> 01:00:20.117
committed unheard of acts of evil.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.078
The resulting victim was the Russian mission.

01:00:23.537 --> 01:00:27.333
The honest heart of Fath 'Ali Shah

01:00:27.416 --> 01:00:29.668
was horrified by the idea
that a handful of wrongdoers

01:00:29.752 --> 01:00:32.212
might destroy our peace and union.

01:00:32.713 --> 01:00:36.300
His Majesty the Shah has sent me, his grandson,

01:00:36.383 --> 01:00:43.849
to request that you, Sovereign,
erase from memory this event.

01:00:44.475 --> 01:00:48.729
Let the world know that,
despite this terrible event,

01:00:48.812 --> 01:00:51.815
two wise monarchs, with their infinite wisdom,

01:00:51.899 --> 01:00:55.027
speak openly and vanquish all suspicion.

01:00:55.110 --> 01:00:58.489
With the greatest joy,
I stand before you,

01:00:58.572 --> 01:01:01.825
Your Imperial Majesty.

01:01:01.909 --> 01:01:05.037
I carry out my grandfather's will-

01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:11.210
that we strengthen peace
between our two peoples."

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:36.360
"His Imperial Majesty

01:01:36.443 --> 01:01:39.905
commands me to assure Your Excellence

01:01:39.988 --> 01:01:46.036
of his pleasure at hearing your explanation,

01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:52.960
as well as the righteous plea
of your sovereign."

01:02:46.180 --> 01:02:48.140
I've been observing you.

01:02:48.223 --> 01:02:50.100
Who let you in here?

01:02:50.768 --> 01:02:53.187
- You have no business here.
- No business at all.

01:02:54.021 --> 01:02:58.025
Then you must leave at once.

01:02:58.358 --> 01:03:00.527
Off you go, sir. Away.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:04.531
- I had no intention of staying.
- Away.

01:03:04.615 --> 01:03:08.285
This ceremony will continue
for a few more hours still.

01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:14.458
As a former diplomat, I'm aware of that.

01:03:14.541 --> 01:03:18.295
A terrible boredom will set in.

01:03:18.378 --> 01:03:20.005
A terrible boredom.

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:21.924
Leave me alone.

01:03:23.217 --> 01:03:25.677
- And what is that?
- What did you say?

01:03:33.393 --> 01:03:37.815
I adore luxury and regal splendor.

01:03:37.898 --> 01:03:44.071
Stasov wasn't a bad architect.

01:03:44.154 --> 01:03:49.368
He loved discipline,
but left space for breathing.

01:03:53.622 --> 01:03:55.666
<i>We cannot stay here.</i>

01:03:55.749 --> 01:03:58.502
<i>The ceremony will finish.
Then they will all come in.</i>

01:03:58.585 --> 01:04:00.212
My God.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:07.010
This is Sévres porcelain.

01:04:07.094 --> 01:04:08.762
My weakness.

01:04:08.846 --> 01:04:11.223
- <i>Beautiful.</i>
- Yes, yes.

01:04:13.141 --> 01:04:15.769
- It's inimitable.
- <i>Beautiful.</i>

01:04:15.853 --> 01:04:22.109
This is the Cameo Service, isn't it?

01:04:22.192 --> 01:04:23.652
Yes, it is.

01:04:29.116 --> 01:04:30.909
Not so close, please.

01:04:40.043 --> 01:04:42.713
What gold.

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:47.134
Sir, it's awkward setting the table
with you here.

01:04:49.219 --> 01:04:52.222
You can admire it later
when you are seated.

01:04:52.306 --> 01:04:53.932
What pure tones.

01:04:54.016 --> 01:04:59.354
The blue and gold are enchanting.

01:04:59.730 --> 01:05:03.233
And the wine sediment color.

01:05:03.317 --> 01:05:07.446
Always such marvelous cooks
here in the Winter Palace.

01:05:07.529 --> 01:05:10.282
<i>Do you recall the taste of food?</i>

01:05:10.365 --> 01:05:12.117
No, I have forgotten.

01:05:12.200 --> 01:05:13.744
<i>You've forgotten.</i>

01:05:13.827 --> 01:05:17.331
Visit the other salons
while waiting for the dinner bell.

01:05:17.414 --> 01:05:20.125
- That blue.
- Please, sir.

01:05:20.208 --> 01:05:21.585
I beg you.

01:05:21.668 --> 01:05:23.670
There's dancing. Come on.

01:05:23.754 --> 01:05:25.547
I beg you. Please.

01:05:26.173 --> 01:05:28.008
We beg you. Please.

01:05:35.349 --> 01:05:37.684
We're getting out.
We're getting out.

01:05:37.768 --> 01:05:39.978
<i>They chased us out.</i>

01:05:42.856 --> 01:05:44.524
<i>It's so dark here.</i>

01:05:50.781 --> 01:05:52.532
Heavens.

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:57.245
I see you have never seen a czar.

01:05:57.454 --> 01:06:03.961
Nor emperors, nor grand princes
in all their magnificence.

01:06:04.544 --> 01:06:07.297
<i>Monarchy is not eternal.</i>

01:06:07.381 --> 01:06:10.133
You think I don't know that?

01:06:10.217 --> 01:06:13.136
Don't I have the right to dream a little?

01:06:14.388 --> 01:06:16.556
<i>We are free, you and I. Dream away.</i>

01:06:17.099 --> 01:06:19.434
<i>There's someone here. Do you hear voices?</i>

01:06:29.903 --> 01:06:32.572
<i>Sir, don't you hear them?</i>

01:06:33.073 --> 01:06:36.076
No, I don't hear anything.

01:06:41.081 --> 01:06:44.334
<i>Look. Someone is moving there.</i>

01:06:44.418 --> 01:06:46.211
Where?

01:06:47.421 --> 01:06:48.880
Where?

01:06:51.842 --> 01:06:57.431
Mr. Orbeli, I don't understand.
What has upset you so?

01:06:58.265 --> 01:07:03.687
You and my father know that
no insects can harm this throne.

01:07:03.770 --> 01:07:06.523
- It's made of silver and treated oak.
- It's not the throne.

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:09.443
I'm very worried.

01:07:09.526 --> 01:07:13.405
Look at that velour from Lyon.
It's completely worn out.

01:07:13.488 --> 01:07:17.117
- We'll restore it. Be patient.
- You don't have the time.

01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:20.162
You're right, Boris.
We don't have time at all.

01:07:22.205 --> 01:07:24.541
You won't ever see him again.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.169
Speak.

01:07:28.128 --> 01:07:29.838
He's your son.

01:07:32.049 --> 01:07:37.095
<i>What difficulty are they having?
They seem uncomfortable.</i>

01:07:37.971 --> 01:07:39.806
What do you expect?

01:07:40.515 --> 01:07:43.143
You descend from the heavens

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:45.937
and no longer know how to behave yourself.

01:07:47.481 --> 01:07:50.567
Your son is the director of the Hermitage.

01:07:50.650 --> 01:07:52.569
Like you and I before him.

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:55.072
The wars ahead- terrible wars.

01:07:55.155 --> 01:07:58.742
But we managed to preserve all this
through the catastrophes.

01:07:58.825 --> 01:08:03.080
I can't hear anymore. Can you hear?

01:08:03.163 --> 01:08:07.084
<i>I can hear, but not very clearly.</i>

01:08:07.167 --> 01:08:09.920
What are they saying?

01:08:10.003 --> 01:08:12.339
<i>The elder Piotrovsky is asking</i>

01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:17.426
<i>whether the director's telephone
is still under surveillance.</i>

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:20.388
<i>His son says, "Forget about that.</i>

01:08:21.098 --> 01:08:26.019
<i>I'd rather talk to you
about the Hermitage cats.</i>

01:08:26.103 --> 01:08:28.522
<i>The cats are still here."</i>

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:35.278
There are so many people
that I wasn't able to help.

01:08:35.362 --> 01:08:37.029
Ten years have passed.

01:08:37.531 --> 01:08:39.491
You know what I'm referring to.

01:08:40.367 --> 01:08:43.120
But everyone speaks well of you.

01:08:43.203 --> 01:08:46.456
Your books are still in print.
Those of Mr. Orbeli too.

01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:48.625
That's particularly admirable.

01:08:48.707 --> 01:08:52.295
The dead weep with joy
when their books are reprinted.

01:08:52.379 --> 01:08:56.216
Especially 37 years later, Mikhail.

01:08:56.299 --> 01:08:58.718
Is something still troubling you?

01:08:59.761 --> 01:09:01.513
Is it the authorities?

01:09:02.973 --> 01:09:05.642
They want acorns without oak trees.

01:09:05.725 --> 01:09:09.479
They are not interested in knowing
how to nurture the tree of culture.

01:09:09.563 --> 01:09:12.399
But it will be their doom
if the tree falls.

01:09:12.482 --> 01:09:15.569
Then there will be nothing left.
Can't they understand that?

01:09:15.652 --> 01:09:17.821
Mr. Orbeli, what awaits us?

01:09:22.783 --> 01:09:25.370
- I'm coming.
- Speak!

01:09:25.912 --> 01:09:29.249
- Listen, Mikhail.
- Let him go.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.001
You're completely alone.

01:09:36.423 --> 01:09:42.011
They won't tell him anything.
I know. Ask me.

01:09:42.095 --> 01:09:43.846
<i>I am asking you.</i>

01:09:43.930 --> 01:09:47.142
I know. Everyone can see the future,

01:09:48.768 --> 01:09:51.563
but no one remembers the past.

01:09:52.606 --> 01:09:57.444
Look how handsome they are.
Such fine young men!

01:09:57.527 --> 01:10:03.033
Beautiful uniforms,
even if I don't like the military.

01:10:05.869 --> 01:10:07.871
<i>You didn't answer my question.</i>

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:20.634
<i>You don't know. You don't know anything.</i>

01:10:33.647 --> 01:10:37.150
<i>Sir. Wait. Wait.</i>

01:10:37.692 --> 01:10:39.361
<i>He doesn't hear me.</i>

01:10:40.487 --> 01:10:42.364
<i>I must apologize.</i>

01:10:43.990 --> 01:10:46.618
<i>They were talking about all sorts of things.</i>

01:10:46.701 --> 01:10:49.871
<i>I could hardly hear them.</i>

01:10:50.372 --> 01:10:54.376
<i>I made it all up- about Orbeli.
About Piotrovsky too.</i>

01:10:55.168 --> 01:10:58.964
- Only God can judge you.
- <i>I made it all up.</i>

01:10:59.047 --> 01:11:02.342
We are free, you and I.
You said it yourself.

01:11:07.722 --> 01:11:09.599
<i>Please, don't run.</i>

01:11:11.351 --> 01:11:16.022
Run. I can't keep up with you.

01:11:18.024 --> 01:11:19.693
Little birds.

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:27.909
Children.

01:11:28.785 --> 01:11:31.162
Anastasia, where are you going?

01:11:34.124 --> 01:11:36.376
They are...

01:11:36.459 --> 01:11:38.295
so light.

01:11:39.212 --> 01:11:41.548
You're always watching me.

01:11:46.720 --> 01:11:49.848
- I have a bad feeling.
- Don't be alarmed.

01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:54.060
Pray. And I shall pray for you.

01:11:54.144 --> 01:11:55.812
Did you hear that?

01:11:59.232 --> 01:12:01.484
Did you hear shots?

01:12:01.568 --> 01:12:04.612
Calm down. God is with you.

01:12:07.574 --> 01:12:11.578
I think someone is following us.

01:12:11.911 --> 01:12:14.080
Calm yourself, Alexandra.

01:12:14.164 --> 01:12:17.334
- If only Alexis could run.
- Calm yourself.

01:12:17.417 --> 01:12:20.837
Doctors are good for nothing.
There is no hope.

01:12:22.130 --> 01:12:23.840
It's my fault.

01:12:24.257 --> 01:12:25.967
Children.

01:12:26.593 --> 01:12:30.305
- Children, behave yourselves.
- Sorry, excuse us.

01:12:31.514 --> 01:12:33.683
Come here, Anastasia.

01:12:33.767 --> 01:12:37.520
Where were you?
I looked for you all morning.

01:12:37.604 --> 01:12:40.648
- We were playing.
- Let's go.

01:12:43.526 --> 01:12:45.487
Where is Alexis?

01:12:57.290 --> 01:13:00.710
- Thank you. I can manage.
- Of course.

01:13:00.794 --> 01:13:03.922
- Are you in pain?
- I'm fine, Mother.

01:13:04.005 --> 01:13:05.715
Move your chair forward.

01:13:05.799 --> 01:13:07.634
You're very strong.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:13.681
You're late for tea.

01:13:14.391 --> 01:13:17.102
- What?
- Forgive me, please.

01:13:19.687 --> 01:13:21.981
Shall we forgive her?
What do you think?

01:13:22.065 --> 01:13:24.067
Anastasia won't do it again.

01:13:24.651 --> 01:13:27.445
See, it's all over.

01:13:30.990 --> 01:13:32.617
Good-bye.

01:13:39.666 --> 01:13:42.210
Why are these doors open?

01:13:44.546 --> 01:13:46.840
Fly away, fly away-

01:13:46.923 --> 01:13:49.467
Fly away, my little angels.

01:14:10.238 --> 01:14:13.283
And here's their cage.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:18.455
They're all here, of course.

01:14:18.538 --> 01:14:23.042
There haven't been so many guests
for a long time.

01:14:23.126 --> 01:14:24.586
Good evening.

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:36.514
Look at that strange fellow.

01:14:54.449 --> 01:14:56.159
<i>But...</i>

01:14:58.328 --> 01:15:01.414
<i>where has my European gone to?</i>

01:15:04.626 --> 01:15:06.085
<i>Where is he?</i>

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.399
<i>There he is.</i>

01:15:32.362 --> 01:15:34.155
<i>He doesn't see me.</i>

01:15:35.990 --> 01:15:37.825
<i>I should go up to him.</i>

01:15:40.161 --> 01:15:41.913
<i>Otherwise he will be offended.</i>

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:09.148
<i>Sir! He can't hear me.</i>

01:16:10.066 --> 01:16:12.402
<i>But I'll see him later.</i>

01:16:36.426 --> 01:16:40.138
Wouldn't it be nice
to jump about like that?

01:16:53.860 --> 01:16:55.111
You know,

01:16:55.194 --> 01:16:59.782
Aristarkh Konstantinovich is being sent to Africa.

01:17:05.371 --> 01:17:10.793
What a tiger. He could eat anyone.

01:17:50.750 --> 01:17:53.753
Your mother has trained the servants well.

01:18:02.303 --> 01:18:06.891
You're doing very well.
The thing about the mazurka is-

01:19:47.200 --> 01:19:49.160
We had an agreement.

01:20:01.047 --> 01:20:02.840
More! More!

01:21:40.396 --> 01:21:44.984
The Great Nicholas Hall is ideal for dancing.

01:21:55.328 --> 01:21:56.954
Thank you.

01:21:57.496 --> 01:22:01.792
St. Petersburg has the best balls in Europe.

01:22:01.876 --> 01:22:07.381
Everyone is so easygoing.
Like one big family.

01:22:12.094 --> 01:22:15.181
There must be over 3,000 people.

01:22:16.891 --> 01:22:18.351
Maybe less.

01:22:32.365 --> 01:22:34.617
I've forgotten everything!

01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.662
I dance so poorly.
I've forgotten everything!

01:22:45.044 --> 01:22:49.131
But it's all coming back to me.

01:22:51.092 --> 01:22:53.803
Good. Very good.

01:23:00.101 --> 01:23:02.311
How beautiful.

01:24:48.250 --> 01:24:50.461
Thank you. Thank you.

01:25:04.683 --> 01:25:06.435
More! More!

01:25:25.412 --> 01:25:29.125
<i>Where were you? I lost you.</i>

01:25:29.208 --> 01:25:31.293
I'm here. Here I am.

01:25:33.796 --> 01:25:35.631
<i>I lost you.</i>

01:25:40.719 --> 01:25:42.346
<i>Lost you.</i>

01:25:43.305 --> 01:25:44.974
<i>I'm sad.</i>

01:25:56.485 --> 01:25:58.988
- <i>Let's go.</i>
- Where to?

01:25:59.155 --> 01:26:00.990
<i>Where to? Forward.</i>

01:26:04.285 --> 01:26:05.744
<i>Forward.</i>

01:26:10.082 --> 01:26:11.750
What will we find there?

01:26:11.834 --> 01:26:13.711
<i>What's there? I don't know.</i>

01:26:14.795 --> 01:26:16.505
I'm staying.

01:26:26.473 --> 01:26:28.726
<i>Farewell, Europe.</i>

01:26:42.948 --> 01:26:44.617
<i>It's over.</i>

01:26:53.042 --> 01:26:55.002
You might say I grew up here.

01:26:58.464 --> 01:27:00.216
I'm not quite myself.

01:27:02.509 --> 01:27:04.845
As if I were in someone else's house.

01:27:30.704 --> 01:27:33.415
Listen up! Look here!

01:27:33.499 --> 01:27:37.044
Listen up! Look here!

01:27:39.004 --> 01:27:43.425
Poor man, your lady has gone away.

01:27:43.509 --> 01:27:48.806
- Flown away like a bird.
- Gone.

01:27:52.101 --> 01:27:54.478
In a flash.

01:28:09.535 --> 01:28:12.621
Look around us.

01:28:12.705 --> 01:28:15.374
The flower of Russian officers.

01:28:23.716 --> 01:28:27.011
I have an idea. Shall we dine together?

01:28:27.553 --> 01:28:28.804
Good.

01:28:28.887 --> 01:28:32.391
I'll wait downstairs. Bring up the coach.

01:28:32.474 --> 01:28:35.811
Have our coats brought up.
And don't lose them.

01:28:58.083 --> 01:29:02.129
When we return to Kursk,
we must organize a ball.

01:29:02.755 --> 01:29:05.299
Perhaps just before Lent.

01:29:27.112 --> 01:29:30.783
We should invite your nephew,
as well as Vareneka.

01:29:30.866 --> 01:29:32.743
Let him see her.

01:30:18.497 --> 01:30:19.748
Nathalie!

01:30:20.833 --> 01:30:23.293
It feels like we're floating.

01:31:26.899 --> 01:31:28.901
Let me pass.

01:31:32.488 --> 01:31:33.739
Sir.

01:32:47.062 --> 01:32:49.481
<i>Sir. Sir.</i>

01:32:51.650 --> 01:32:54.861
<i>A pity you're not here with me.</i>

01:32:57.656 --> 01:32:59.866
<i>You would understand everything.</i>

01:33:02.661 --> 01:33:04.246
<i>Look.</i>

01:33:05.831 --> 01:33:07.874
<i>The sea is all around.</i>

01:33:11.920 --> 01:33:14.631
<i>And we are destined to sail forever,</i>

01:33:16.508 --> 01:33:18.927
<i>to live forever.</i>
