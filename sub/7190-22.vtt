00:00.667 --> 00:04.754
- Emma, the clones, you.

00:04.838 --> 00:08.550
- Yes.
Emma, the clones, me.

00:08.633 --> 00:10.510
That's why I like you, Agey.

00:10.593 --> 00:11.928
You get me.

00:12.011 --> 00:14.764
- This is why the Council
forbids cloning.

00:14.848 --> 00:18.101
You never know which part of
a person will get amplified.

00:18.184 --> 00:20.562
- And which part
would that be, Agey?

00:20.645 --> 00:22.272
My chattiness?

00:22.355 --> 00:23.732
My goody-goodyness?

00:23.815 --> 00:25.775
My inexplicable love of glitter?

00:25.859 --> 00:28.153
- Your evil part.

00:28.236 --> 00:31.489
- [laughing] Are you serious?

00:31.573 --> 00:32.782
[imitating Agamemnon]
"Your evil part."

00:32.866 --> 00:36.119
- You cannot be allowed to roam
freely, especially with

00:36.202 --> 00:39.414
the Last Light of the Fool Moon
approaching.

00:39.497 --> 00:40.832
- Why?

00:40.915 --> 00:41.708
You think I might not try to
stop Desdemona

00:41.791 --> 00:43.960
from destroying the Realm?

00:44.043 --> 00:45.295
- Well...

00:45.378 --> 00:47.172
- Don't be silly.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.215
Of course I'll stop her...

00:49.299 --> 00:52.552
And then I'll destroy
the Realm myself.

00:52.635 --> 00:54.846
- You wouldn't dare.

00:54.929 --> 00:56.723
What are you doing?

00:56.806 --> 01:01.644
- Oh, just imagining a dark,
gray blob of nothingness.

01:01.728 --> 01:04.022
- Nothingness?

01:04.105 --> 01:05.522
Ah.

01:05.607 --> 01:07.525
- [laughing]

01:10.069 --> 01:11.029
- We have to hurry.

01:11.112 --> 01:13.740
Desdemona could
show up any minute.

01:13.823 --> 01:14.991
- Now what?

01:15.074 --> 01:19.496
- Throw it up and hope
there's a portal open.

01:19.579 --> 01:22.290
- It worked, on the first try.

01:22.373 --> 01:24.417
[gasps]

01:24.501 --> 01:27.295
- [grunting]

01:27.378 --> 01:27.796
- Agamemnon?

01:27.879 --> 01:30.298
- Ramona?

01:30.381 --> 01:32.217
You're in Limbo?
How?

01:32.300 --> 01:32.967
- Desdemona trapped me.

01:33.051 --> 01:35.512
She's up to no good.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.596
- And you know how I got here.

01:36.679 --> 01:40.016
- Yes, I guess I acted harshly.
- Mm-hmm.

01:40.099 --> 01:43.436
- So if we're all in here,
who's guarding the Realm?

01:44.854 --> 01:45.313
ALL: Oh, no!

02:27.939 --> 02:28.898
I tied my own
shoelaces this morning.

02:28.982 --> 02:31.901
- Oh, congratulations.

02:31.985 --> 02:32.735
- Really?
That's it?

02:32.819 --> 02:33.736
That's all I get?

02:33.820 --> 02:36.197
- What do you mean?

02:36.281 --> 02:38.157
- Well, I've been learning to
do things without magic

02:38.241 --> 02:39.325
like you wanted.

02:39.409 --> 02:41.035
But it's like you
don't even care.

02:41.119 --> 02:44.163

other things on my mind.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.373
- Like what?

02:45.456 --> 02:46.624
- Uh, losing my best friend.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.918
- Oh, that.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.920
- Yeah, that.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.088
I gotta get to class.

02:55.633 --> 02:56.509
- Emma, wait!

02:58.052 --> 02:59.429
- Hey, Daniel, what's up?

02:59.512 --> 03:01.264
- I just wanted to see how
you're doing

03:01.347 --> 03:01.973
with the whole Andi thing.

03:02.056 --> 03:04.642
- I'm hanging in there.

03:04.726 --> 03:05.685
Never mind, it's no big deal.

03:05.768 --> 03:08.479
- It is a big deal.

03:08.563 --> 03:09.939
I tried talking
to her yesterday.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.108
- You did?
- Yeah.

03:12.191 --> 03:13.776
I even let her win at
the griping mushroom hunt.

03:13.860 --> 03:16.404
- You let her win?

03:16.487 --> 03:18.406
- I mean, no, she smoked me
but...

03:20.366 --> 03:21.492
I told her it was my fault.

03:22.869 --> 03:24.746
I told you to send him
back into the game.

03:24.829 --> 03:26.831
- He was about to sink his
teeth into Sophie's brain.

03:26.915 --> 03:27.832
You had every right to--

03:27.916 --> 03:29.626

03:29.709 --> 03:30.919
Oh, no, I'm gonna
be late for class.

03:31.002 --> 03:36.215
- Wait, uh...could you meet me
after school today,

03:36.299 --> 03:38.843
4 o'clock at our spot?

03:38.927 --> 03:39.218
- Sure.

03:46.601 --> 03:47.936
- Wait, Daniel?

03:48.019 --> 03:49.103
- Yeah?

03:49.187 --> 03:50.605
- Can we do 3:30 instead?

03:50.688 --> 03:52.982
- Sure.

04:02.325 --> 04:05.536
- Do you think these will grow
into watermelons

04:05.620 --> 04:07.664
inside the cosmic trash can?

04:07.747 --> 04:09.582
- Soph, it's just a trash can.

04:09.666 --> 04:11.000
There's nobody on the other si--

04:12.627 --> 04:14.921
- Such rude aliens!

04:18.966 --> 04:20.385
- No, Soph, wait!

04:25.765 --> 04:27.433
O-S.

04:30.019 --> 04:31.020
It says SOS.

04:31.104 --> 04:32.814
- What does "sos" mean?

04:32.897 --> 04:34.732
- SOS, it's like
a call for help.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.276
- Lily.

04:37.360 --> 04:37.443
Lily?

04:39.654 --> 04:41.322
Could this be from Nurse Lily?

04:41.406 --> 04:44.158
- Nurse Lily is an alien?

04:50.748 --> 04:52.875
- There you are.

04:52.959 --> 04:54.711
I've been texting
you all afternoon.

04:54.794 --> 04:57.130
- Oh, yeah, sorry, I was busy.

04:57.213 --> 05:00.341
- Listen, I think we should
try again with the Council.

05:00.425 --> 05:01.551
- Jax--

05:01.634 --> 05:03.553
- And this time, maybe
not bring the Hex.

05:03.636 --> 05:04.512
He blocked me from
going in last time.

05:04.595 --> 05:07.557
What was up with that?
- Jax.

05:07.640 --> 05:09.475
- And if the Council's not
there, then I can just walk

05:09.559 --> 05:11.811
right in and grab my powers
off of Agamemnon's desk.

05:11.894 --> 05:13.730
- Jax!

05:13.813 --> 05:14.480
Look, I've been thinking.

05:16.399 --> 05:17.900
- Oh, no.

05:17.984 --> 05:20.945
No good sentence ever started
with "I've been thinking."

05:21.029 --> 05:23.072
- And I don't think
this is working out.

05:24.032 --> 05:25.742
- What do you mean?

05:25.825 --> 05:28.745
- I realized all the things
you like most about me--

05:28.828 --> 05:33.499
when I'm impulsive, when I use
magic to get what I want--

05:34.500 --> 05:36.085
that's not really me.

05:36.169 --> 05:38.087
- Of course it's you.

05:38.171 --> 05:39.338
- That's the Fool Moon

05:39.422 --> 05:41.674
and the excitement of learning
new spells.

05:41.758 --> 05:46.137
But underneath all that,
I'm still just me.

05:46.220 --> 05:48.556
Boring, responsible,
glittery Emma.

05:48.639 --> 05:50.475
- Well, I--I--

05:57.356 --> 05:59.442
I like that you're responsible.

05:59.525 --> 06:00.068
- No, you don't.

06:00.151 --> 06:01.527
And that's okay.

06:01.611 --> 06:03.780
But you should be with someone
you can be

06:03.863 --> 06:04.822
totally carefree with.

06:04.906 --> 06:08.409
- Come on, Emma,
we can make this work.

06:08.493 --> 06:11.579
I know I've been selfish lately.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.956
But after the Fool Moon,
everything will change.

06:14.040 --> 06:16.334
You'll see.

06:16.417 --> 06:19.087
- I'm sorry, Jax, but
I've made up my mind.

06:20.379 --> 06:22.715
But I do still wanna be friends.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.551
- Yeah, sure, whatevs.

06:25.635 --> 06:27.387
- Okay, then, I guess
I should go.

06:28.346 --> 06:28.387
- Good.

06:37.063 --> 06:38.648
- Thanks for meeting me here.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.274
Uh, these are for you.

06:40.358 --> 06:40.608
- What are these?

06:43.069 --> 06:43.736
- Daisies, your favorite.

06:43.820 --> 06:44.821
- Oh.

06:44.904 --> 06:46.697
Oh, yeah.

06:49.575 --> 06:53.871
- Listen, I just wanted to
apologize for everything.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.083
First of all, for breaking up
with you the way I did.

06:57.166 --> 06:59.335
I-I just freaked out when
I saw those Emmas.

06:59.418 --> 07:02.213
- Yeah, I remember,
I saw your face.

07:04.048 --> 07:06.759
[laughs]
- Oh.

07:06.843 --> 07:10.513
But not being able to be with
you these last couple of weeks,

07:10.596 --> 07:10.930
it made me realize something.

07:11.013 --> 07:12.223
- What?

07:12.306 --> 07:14.559
- That I wanna be with you.

07:14.642 --> 07:17.645
Magic powers or no
magic powers because--

07:17.728 --> 07:23.025
- [laughs] Oh, man, I tried
to keep a straight face,

07:23.109 --> 07:27.530
but you--your sad
puppy dog eyes.

07:27.613 --> 07:29.157
You're just too much.

07:29.240 --> 07:30.533
- I-I don't get it.

07:30.616 --> 07:32.285
- I really thought I could make
it through at least a day

07:32.368 --> 07:34.745
trying to be this version.

07:34.829 --> 07:36.581
But it's just too hard.

07:36.664 --> 07:38.166
- This version of what?

07:40.793 --> 07:43.045
Wait...

07:43.129 --> 07:45.381
- The goody-goody
version of Emma.

07:45.464 --> 07:50.386
The cheesy, honorable,
always early Emma.

07:50.469 --> 07:51.721
- You!

07:51.804 --> 07:52.930
Where did you come from?

07:53.014 --> 07:55.808
- Oh, a very special place.

07:55.892 --> 07:56.350
Here, let me show you.

07:56.434 --> 07:57.852
- Emma, run!

08:06.152 --> 08:10.072
- Where--where are we?

08:15.203 --> 08:17.413
- Hey.
Hey, Andi.

08:18.915 --> 08:19.874
- Me?

08:19.957 --> 08:21.375
- Yeah, you.

08:21.459 --> 08:22.543
- What do you want?

08:22.627 --> 08:23.878
And this better
not be about Emma.

08:25.004 --> 08:26.547
- During the Last Light
of the Fool Moon,

08:26.631 --> 08:30.593
Emma might be in danger
by some bad witches.

08:30.676 --> 08:31.928
- What kind of danger?

08:32.010 --> 08:34.304
- Only heard rumors, but if
they can get rid of

08:34.388 --> 08:35.765
the Chosen One,
anything can happen.

08:35.847 --> 08:40.269
I mean, I wanna help Emma, but--
- You lost your powers.

08:40.352 --> 08:43.105
- And she won't help me steal
them back from the Council.

08:43.188 --> 08:44.607
- Well, wait, what does
this have to do with me?

08:44.690 --> 08:48.194
- You and I, we're
both mad at Emma.

08:48.277 --> 08:50.196
And we still want to help her.

08:50.279 --> 08:51.906
- Wait, what would
you have in mind?

08:51.989 --> 08:53.866
- You help me get
my powers back,

08:53.950 --> 08:55.910
and I'll help you
get Phillip back.

08:55.993 --> 08:58.329
- Wait, how am I supposed
to help you do that?

08:58.412 --> 08:59.622
- My powers are being
stored at the Council.

08:59.705 --> 09:03.751
Now Emma told me you
know how to get in there.

09:03.834 --> 09:04.627
So how about it?

09:05.878 --> 09:07.338
- Okay, it's a deal.

09:07.421 --> 09:09.799
But if you double cross me, I'll
tell Miss Information you cried

09:09.882 --> 09:11.634
while watching the video
of a crippled goat

09:11.717 --> 09:13.177
taking his first steps.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.012
- How did you know about that?

09:15.096 --> 09:16.639
- Oh, I didn't,
I was making it up.

09:16.722 --> 09:18.516
But, hey, if it's true,
even better.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.227
- Hello--oh.

09:22.311 --> 09:23.938
You get out of here right now!

09:24.021 --> 09:27.608
Now I'm gonna have to disinfect
the whole living room.

09:27.692 --> 09:29.527
- Wait, we got a message
from the Magic Realm.

09:29.610 --> 09:29.694
- You did?

09:31.654 --> 09:32.613
How?

09:32.697 --> 09:34.323
- Diego opened
the cosmic trash can...

09:34.407 --> 09:35.283
- A black hole.

09:35.366 --> 09:36.534
- And this note
flew out of it.

09:36.617 --> 09:38.953
- Shoo, shoo, shoo,
shoo, shoo, shoo.

09:41.163 --> 09:43.165
Sos--
ALL: SOS!

09:43.249 --> 09:45.501
- Oh, I knew that.

09:47.670 --> 09:51.882
"Lily, Ramona and Agamemnon
of the Witches Council."

09:51.966 --> 09:57.930
Oh! "Sent to Limbo by rebel
Council member Desdemona.

09:58.014 --> 10:02.768
"Aims to destroy Magic Realm
at Last Light of Fool Moon.

10:02.852 --> 10:05.313
Send help stat."

10:05.396 --> 10:06.856
This is my chance.

10:06.939 --> 10:10.651
This is my chance to proof
myself to all witch-kind!

10:10.735 --> 10:13.654
I must save the Magic Realm
from destruction.

10:15.781 --> 10:17.450
- Wait, where are you going?

10:17.533 --> 10:19.118
- Shopping, of course.

10:19.201 --> 10:23.748
I need the perfect Savior
of the Magic Realm outfit.

10:27.626 --> 10:29.795
- We need to find Emma ASAP.

10:29.879 --> 10:32.214
- Oh, she was
just here with Jax.

10:32.298 --> 10:34.425
I think they might
have been fighting.

10:34.508 --> 10:36.260
- I have one more day
for the Last Light.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.054
If Daniel and Emma
don't get together,

10:38.137 --> 10:40.389
then she will keep her powers.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.433
- She can block you from
mixing the two lights.

10:42.516 --> 10:43.726
- Precisely.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.437
That's why we have to
be ready for Plan B.

10:46.520 --> 10:49.148
- Ohh, is it another very
detailed, elaborate

10:49.231 --> 10:50.733
and tricky plan?

10:50.816 --> 10:54.779
- [laughs] Not exactly,
we just lock her up.

10:54.862 --> 10:57.490
- Oh, speaking
of the Last Lights,

10:57.573 --> 10:59.116
is our deal still on?

10:59.200 --> 11:01.202
When you rule the world,
I get to be

11:01.285 --> 11:02.578
the most famous journalist
on the planet?

11:02.661 --> 11:06.916
- Oh, who cares
about--of course.

11:06.999 --> 11:10.002
But only if you help me
find Emma right now.

11:10.086 --> 11:14.507
- APB, APB, I need the location
on Emma Alonso ASAP.

11:16.634 --> 11:19.095
- Okay, that's good enough.

11:19.178 --> 11:20.304
Let's get the show on the road.

11:20.388 --> 11:22.098
- Okay, remember,
this is exerting

11:22.181 --> 11:24.100
about 300 PSI of pressure.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.103
It'll hold it open for about two
minutes, so you better be fast.

11:27.186 --> 11:28.771
- I know my way around.

11:28.854 --> 11:32.191
- Oh, yeah, that's right, you
used to get in trouble a lot.

11:41.367 --> 11:43.661
- Socks, socks, more socks!

11:43.744 --> 11:45.621
Tons of keys.

11:45.704 --> 11:48.416
- Wallets, sunglasses,
remote controls.

11:49.208 --> 11:50.876
- My dad would love this place.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.754
He's always losing his
sunglasses and the remote.

11:55.881 --> 11:58.884
- This must be a place
where lost things end up.

11:58.968 --> 12:00.344
- I think you're right.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.680
I knew I wasn't crazy when I
thought the laundry machine

12:02.763 --> 12:04.473
was eating my socks!

12:04.557 --> 12:06.225
- Look, there's a door.

12:06.308 --> 12:07.768
- Yes, but how do we open it?

12:09.061 --> 12:10.187
Maybe--

12:11.355 --> 12:12.565
we can't be in here
anymore,

12:12.648 --> 12:14.150
we've gotta go
so unlock this door.

12:17.903 --> 12:19.488
Maybe not.

12:19.572 --> 12:20.698
- That was a good idea.

12:22.575 --> 12:24.160
I guess I'll have to do it
the old-fashioned way.

12:25.411 --> 12:25.870
- [creaking noise]

12:27.580 --> 12:28.873
- That can't be good.

12:30.374 --> 12:32.668
No, definitely not good!

12:32.751 --> 12:32.793
- Ugh.

12:37.673 --> 12:38.716
- We've gotta get out of here.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.469
- How are you gonna
get to the door?

12:41.552 --> 12:43.262
- We have to find something
to break the lock with.

12:46.515 --> 12:47.850
How's that gonna help?

12:47.933 --> 12:49.059
- I don't know!

12:52.146 --> 12:54.273
- See, nothing's working.

12:54.356 --> 12:55.357
The walls keep moving.

13:06.243 --> 13:07.286
It stopped.

13:15.377 --> 13:17.630
- Jax, hurry up, I can't
hold it much longer.

13:17.713 --> 13:18.797
JAX: On my way!

13:20.216 --> 13:21.258
I got it.

13:27.181 --> 13:29.183
- [gasping]

13:29.266 --> 13:30.518
That was a close call.

13:30.601 --> 13:31.644
For a second there, I
thought you were gonna drop--

13:31.727 --> 13:32.978
- [echoes] Ah, ah, ah, ah.

13:39.777 --> 13:41.403
You almost gave me
a heart attack.

13:41.487 --> 13:43.781
- Oh, please, I've got
reflexes like a cat.

13:48.494 --> 13:49.828
- You need some help?

13:49.912 --> 13:52.998
- No, I've got it.
- Really?

13:53.082 --> 13:56.335
Because the vein popping out of
your head says you don't got it.

13:56.418 --> 13:57.753
- What's the point in you
trying if I can't

13:57.836 --> 13:57.962
even get it open?

14:00.214 --> 14:03.133
Yeah, well, it's 'cause
I loosened it for you.

14:03.217 --> 14:04.009
- Mm-hmm.

14:16.522 --> 14:17.690
- So did it work?

14:17.773 --> 14:18.941
I mean, I did not go through
all that trouble for it

14:19.024 --> 14:20.651
to not have worked.

14:20.734 --> 14:22.987
[mumbling]

14:23.070 --> 14:24.196
- Yes, it worked.

14:24.280 --> 14:26.907
- [mumbling]

14:32.204 --> 14:35.374
- Okay, now, does this say

14:35.457 --> 14:39.211
Savior of the Galactical Empire
or what?

14:39.295 --> 14:40.087
Watch, watch.

14:41.672 --> 14:43.465
- Ugh, Mother,
who cares about fashion?

14:43.549 --> 14:45.175
The Magic Realm is at stake.

14:45.259 --> 14:46.927
ALL: [gasps]

14:47.011 --> 14:49.638
- Did I just say,
"who cares about fashion"?

14:49.722 --> 14:50.723
- [gasping]

14:50.806 --> 14:55.603
[crying]
This is your influence.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.187
- Seriously,
what's gotten into you?

14:58.564 --> 15:00.190
I like it.

15:00.274 --> 15:01.650
- If the Magic Realm
is destroyed, all witches

15:01.734 --> 15:03.319
will be destroyed with it.

15:03.402 --> 15:04.987
That means my mom and me.

15:05.070 --> 15:07.197
- [crying]
- And Emma and Jax.

15:07.281 --> 15:08.324
We have to do something.

15:09.617 --> 15:11.619
- Who are you calling?

15:11.702 --> 15:12.536
- Emma, we need her help.

15:12.620 --> 15:15.539
- Ew, we don't need her.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.916
My magic skills are flawless.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.335
- Hmm.

15:19.418 --> 15:22.838
- Um, you did accidentally turn
Sophie into a beanbag chair

15:22.921 --> 15:24.340
last week.

15:24.423 --> 15:28.510
- Ah, that was the comfiest
five minutes of my life.

15:35.893 --> 15:39.021
- Hey, I know you're excited,
but lay off the tools.

15:39.104 --> 15:42.316
- As you wish.
Get it?

15:42.399 --> 15:43.609
Because I'm like a genie now,
'cause I got my powers back?

15:43.692 --> 15:46.195
And I'm like a--

15:46.278 --> 15:47.655
Okay, you get it.

15:53.118 --> 15:57.206
- Did you just break
into the Council?

15:57.289 --> 15:59.583
- Yeah, we did, so?

15:59.667 --> 16:02.461
- So why didn't you
just ask me to do it?

16:02.544 --> 16:03.253
- What?

16:03.337 --> 16:06.173
I did, like 20 times, remember?

16:06.256 --> 16:09.093
And you got so upset last time,
you broke up with me.

16:09.176 --> 16:10.886
- That's so silly.

16:10.969 --> 16:12.554
Why would I ever do that?

16:14.014 --> 16:16.225
Didn't the Council see you
when you broke in?

16:16.308 --> 16:18.477
- No, I just had to get into
Agamemnon's desk,

16:18.560 --> 16:19.895
and he wasn't even there.

16:19.978 --> 16:20.938
- Of course he isn't.

16:21.021 --> 16:22.898
He's in Limbo.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.066
- Why?

16:24.149 --> 16:26.735
- Because I sent him there.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.404
- Wait, E, is that you?

16:28.487 --> 16:30.906
- It's me.

16:30.989 --> 16:32.616
I'm back!

16:32.700 --> 16:33.742
- What?

16:33.826 --> 16:34.576
No way, Emma would never
clone herself again.

16:34.660 --> 16:36.328
- She didn't.

16:36.412 --> 16:40.165
The power of our rays colliding
made some kind of strange

16:40.249 --> 16:42.334
energy beam that sent me
to the Abyss.

16:42.418 --> 16:45.087
- E, I can't believe it.

16:45.170 --> 16:45.212
I've missed you.

16:47.339 --> 16:49.675
- Don't bother trying
to go warn Emma.

16:49.758 --> 16:51.385
You won't find her.

16:51.468 --> 16:52.720
- What did you do to her?

16:52.803 --> 16:54.221
- I sent her to the Abyss,

16:54.304 --> 16:56.932
along with her lame-o boyfriend
Daniel.

16:57.015 --> 16:58.475
- What? Why?

16:58.559 --> 17:01.103
- So she can't get in my way
when I destroy the Magic Realm.

17:01.186 --> 17:04.106
- Wait, you want to
destroy the Realm, too?

17:04.189 --> 17:05.898
- Don't worry,
I'm sure there's tons

17:05.983 --> 17:09.361
of old, boring lost books in it
to entertain them.

17:09.444 --> 17:11.280
- I have to go to the--
- Oh, what is that?

17:11.363 --> 17:11.780
You wanna join them?

17:11.864 --> 17:13.574
No problem.

17:22.624 --> 17:24.001
DESDEMONA: Hurry up.

17:25.752 --> 17:27.253
Are you sure Emma is here?

17:27.337 --> 17:28.505
- Positive.

17:28.589 --> 17:29.965
Several tipsters reported
seeing her walk in

17:30.048 --> 17:31.425
just a few minutes ago.

17:31.508 --> 17:32.801
- Good.

17:32.885 --> 17:35.095
I found the perfect place
to lock her up.

17:35.179 --> 17:36.972
- Uh, there's still a chance
she'll get back together with

17:37.055 --> 17:38.807
Daniel before tomorrow night.

17:38.891 --> 17:41.143
- But we need at least
two members of the Council

17:41.226 --> 17:43.562
to take her powers away.

17:43.645 --> 17:46.064
And since Lily and Agamemnon
know about my plan

17:46.148 --> 17:48.400
to destroy the Realm,
I can't let 'em out.

17:54.156 --> 17:56.325
- I'm so glad you're back.

17:56.408 --> 17:59.161
Huh, and you're still
wearing my jacket.

17:59.244 --> 18:01.663
- Of course I still am.

18:01.747 --> 18:03.373
It kept me warm in the Abyss.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.834
It gets cold in there.

18:05.918 --> 18:09.171
Hey, back in the hallway,
what did you mean by

18:09.254 --> 18:12.382
"You want to destroy
the Realm <i>too</i> "?

18:12.466 --> 18:14.426
Do you know about
Desdemona's plan?

18:14.510 --> 18:17.304
- Actually, that was my plan.

18:17.387 --> 18:18.889
Well, my dad's.

18:18.972 --> 18:21.725
I was supposed to trick Emma--
the other Emma--

18:21.809 --> 18:23.936
into combining
the last two lights.

18:24.019 --> 18:25.437
That's why we were together.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.481
- What?
You were together?

18:28.440 --> 18:30.067
- Don't get jealous.

18:30.734 --> 18:32.319
You're here now.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.445
And together we can rule
the human world

18:33.529 --> 18:37.241
as the most powerful
magical couple ever.

18:38.534 --> 18:40.369
- You think your dad
will go for that?

18:40.452 --> 18:42.704
- [laughs]
He doesn't have to know.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.082
And once this is done,

18:46.625 --> 18:50.045
I don't have to do anything
he says ever again.

18:50.128 --> 18:52.923
He'll have to do what we want.

18:54.132 --> 18:56.677
So...what do you say?

19:01.306 --> 19:05.644
- I say, this is
the best plan ever.

19:09.606 --> 19:10.816
- Are you hungry?

19:10.899 --> 19:11.358
I can look for something to eat.

19:14.278 --> 19:17.281
Here's a half-eaten
cheese sandwich.

19:17.364 --> 19:18.240
- I'm good, thanks.

19:20.742 --> 19:26.540
Daniel, I'm so sorry you got
dragged into this...literally.

19:26.623 --> 19:27.541
- It's okay.

19:27.624 --> 19:29.167
- No, it's not.

19:29.251 --> 19:30.711
You broke up with me because you
didn't want anything

19:30.794 --> 19:31.920
to do with magic.

19:32.004 --> 19:33.422
And now you're stuck
here because of magic.

19:33.505 --> 19:36.758
- It's not that I don't
like you're a witch.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.093
I'm just scared of
all the magic threats

19:38.176 --> 19:40.095
that could come after you.

19:40.178 --> 19:43.015
- Like a psycho principal
or an evil clone of myself?

19:43.098 --> 19:45.100
- Exactly.

19:45.183 --> 19:49.104
And since I don't have powers,
I'm afraid I can't protect you.

19:49.187 --> 19:51.523
- Daniel, I don't care
if you have powers or not.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.276
I like you for you.

19:54.359 --> 19:56.612
You could have four heads,
no elbows,

19:56.695 --> 20:01.867
the biggest zit known to man--
you'd still be you.

20:04.202 --> 20:05.871
We should try more keys.

20:11.710 --> 20:13.670
- Em, whatever happens, I--

20:13.754 --> 20:15.547
- I know.

20:16.965 --> 20:18.008
Me, too.

20:28.143 --> 20:29.353
- What's up, Desdemona?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.813
- Gigi?
- What are you doing here?

20:31.897 --> 20:33.690
This is a private office.

20:33.774 --> 20:34.358
- This is our chance.

20:34.441 --> 20:36.151
Get rid of Emma now.

20:36.234 --> 20:36.985
And Jax while you're at.

20:37.069 --> 20:40.072
- Oh, great thinking.

20:40.155 --> 20:41.823
I'll turn them into flies.

20:42.407 --> 20:43.825
- Not so fast.

20:43.909 --> 20:44.868
[laughing]

20:44.952 --> 20:47.204
- Great timing, Junior.

20:47.287 --> 20:48.830
- Let go of me.

20:48.914 --> 20:49.957
- Two Jaxes?

20:50.040 --> 20:52.167
- Help me, minion.

20:54.586 --> 20:55.504
- A little help here.

20:59.007 --> 21:01.009
- Junior!

21:01.093 --> 21:04.388
You get rid of my minion,
I'll get rid of yours.

21:04.471 --> 21:07.307
- Aw, did you forget?

21:07.391 --> 21:09.059
You don't have powers anymore.

21:09.142 --> 21:11.561
- As the leaf
falls from the tree,

21:11.645 --> 21:13.313
from this spell may you be free.

21:16.483 --> 21:18.902
- [crying]
My minion.

21:21.947 --> 21:24.032
You little--

21:24.116 --> 21:25.158
- Stop fighting.

21:25.242 --> 21:27.619
You can get more minions later.

21:27.703 --> 21:28.912
We're here to talk
about the Last Light.

21:28.996 --> 21:31.832
- You think you can stop me?

21:31.915 --> 21:34.084
- We don't wanna stop you.

21:34.167 --> 21:35.919
We want to join you.
