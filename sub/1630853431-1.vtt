WEBVTT

01:06.633 --> 01:08.094
How do you like the GT?

01:09.138 --> 01:11.810
Actually, I prefer the Q4.

01:12.896 --> 01:14.023
Better turning radius.

01:31.684 --> 01:32.769
Have a nice day, sir.

01:35.357 --> 01:39.115
-Ahora, por favor.
-Hágame el favor. Sí, ya sé, Benny...

01:40.785 --> 01:43.833
- Benny, por favor, dame chance.
-Oye, pero ¿por qué discutes conmigo?

01:43.916 --> 01:45.545
Que te metas a lavar las manos ahora.

01:59.614 --> 02:01.702
No, no. Frank, Frank. Yeah, no, no, no.

02:01.785 --> 02:04.039
My client is not going above five!

02:04.123 --> 02:06.461
- Chad, listen. Six million is completely--
-No! I said five, not six!

02:06.545 --> 02:08.716
- We're worth at least six million.
-No, do not talk over me!

02:15.479 --> 02:17.107
어, 어. 진자. 어. 두시.

02:17.191 --> 02:19.320
숙제 많다
넌 발레 해야 되고, 넌 태권도 해야 되고

02:19.403 --> 02:21.784
너네들 오늘
피아노 30분 해야 돼, 알았지?

02:35.101 --> 02:39.694
Ey, tan linda. Eso, eso. Sonríe.

02:51.510 --> 02:54.808
Not only will this
new development provide affordable housing

02:54.891 --> 02:58.732
and much-needed retail space,
it will add hundreds of jobs.

02:58.816 --> 03:01.822
Well-paying, green jobs.

03:02.406 --> 03:06.080
My wife Kathryn and I,
along with Councilman Garcia,

03:06.163 --> 03:07.876
couldn't be prouder to be partnering

03:07.959 --> 03:09.963
with the wonderful people
of this community.

03:10.965 --> 03:13.261
-Boo!

03:14.138 --> 03:16.434
You're gonna have your name
all over this city.

03:19.231 --> 03:22.029
See you, Marco.
I promise I'll know my lines by tomorrow.

03:22.112 --> 03:23.114
-Bye, Sofia.
-Bye.

03:29.043 --> 03:30.128
Don't-- Don't say anything.

03:30.211 --> 03:31.213
I didn't.

03:32.508 --> 03:33.636
I'm allowed to smile.

03:35.305 --> 03:37.017
Dad, go, go, go, go.

03:46.035 --> 03:48.832
Oh, Mr. Kim. Everything okay?

03:48.916 --> 03:51.630
Oh, yeah, yeah. Toilet flush good.

04:14.466 --> 04:15.301
No, no!

05:01.770 --> 05:03.857
- ¡Amá!

05:07.364 --> 05:10.996
Cheeseburger and fries.
Turkey sandwich and coleslaw.

05:12.332 --> 05:14.712
I'm missing something. What is it?
I'm missing something.

05:23.647 --> 05:25.275
-Line!
-Let's reset.

05:25.358 --> 05:27.028
-Let's reset.

05:27.112 --> 05:28.740
What is that stupid-- I can't--

05:28.824 --> 05:31.788
This isn't even gonna be in the movie.
It's gonna be-- Can you not?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.003
The wrap party's tomorrow night.

05:35.086 --> 05:36.631
I assume you want me
to get you out of that.

05:36.715 --> 05:38.510
-That's correct.
-And Variety wants ten minutes.

05:38.594 --> 05:40.138
No, no, I'm already late.
Anytime next week.

05:40.221 --> 05:43.019
Okay, don't take Olympic.
There's a bunch of paparazzi out there.

06:12.828 --> 06:15.458
That was the second time I got Lady Gaga.

06:15.542 --> 06:16.836
Got a cool 500 for it.

06:16.920 --> 06:18.882
That's it? My quote's a minimum 750.

06:18.966 --> 06:20.426
Yeah, yeah. Mine too.

06:20.511 --> 06:23.182
-Is that somebody?
-Nah, that's nobody.

06:40.884 --> 06:42.387
God, I've missed that hoodie.

06:48.775 --> 06:50.486
I hate how much this turns me on.

06:58.461 --> 07:00.507
So I was talking to one of the teachers
at school.

07:00.591 --> 07:02.385
She's going through a divorce too, and--

07:02.469 --> 07:05.016
-I'm not divorced. We're separated, okay?

07:05.099 --> 07:07.605
You need a candle in your bathroom
or at least some kind of spray.

07:07.688 --> 07:10.861
Cochino! Will you tell my stupid brother
how pretty the new music teacher is?

07:10.944 --> 07:13.700
She's fine. She's okay.
She's about what you could probably get.

07:13.784 --> 07:15.286
You don't think she's pretty?

07:15.369 --> 07:17.708
You know who's pretty? The gym lady.

07:17.792 --> 07:19.629
With that whistle?

07:19.712 --> 07:21.048
What?

07:35.661 --> 07:36.746
Antonio.

07:40.587 --> 07:44.094
Hey. Sorry I'm early.
We were just overstaffed today.

07:44.679 --> 07:45.597
Stay for dinner.

07:45.681 --> 07:46.933
We're making carne asada.

07:47.016 --> 07:49.522
Thanks, Clara,
but I should probably get going.

07:49.605 --> 07:51.693
-Okay, Marco. Get your stuff, honey.
-Coming, Mom.

07:54.239 --> 07:56.034
You okay? You seem upset.

07:57.245 --> 07:58.540
No. No, I'm fine.

08:01.086 --> 08:04.092
The bank denied my loan.
So I have to take a year off from school.

08:04.176 --> 08:05.721
-Why?
-Because--

08:05.804 --> 08:07.265
-Remember when my car broke down?
-Yeah.

08:07.348 --> 08:09.770
I just--
I fell behind on some payments, and…

08:10.564 --> 08:13.194
Two semesters. That's all I had left.

08:14.739 --> 08:17.202
How much do you need? I have some savings.

08:17.285 --> 08:20.166
Yeah. They want $12,850.

08:20.249 --> 08:22.212
-You got that laying around?

08:23.422 --> 08:26.804
I-I can get a second job.
Uh, we can figure this out.

08:26.888 --> 08:29.518
This-- This isn't your problem.

08:29.602 --> 08:31.271
I want it to be my problem.

08:32.983 --> 08:34.069
Yeah, uh…

08:35.029 --> 08:38.035
Look,
there's no real easy way to say this,

08:38.118 --> 08:41.751
but, uh, I started seeing someone.

08:44.840 --> 08:47.011
What? Who?

08:47.763 --> 08:50.644
His name is Ronnie. He's a Realtor.

08:51.521 --> 08:53.399
Ronnie the Realtor?

08:54.401 --> 08:57.616
The guy from the bus benches? This guy?

08:57.700 --> 08:59.662
-He's nice to me.
-I'm not nice to you?

08:59.745 --> 09:02.417
I-- Come on, Antonio.
Let's not fight about this.

09:03.252 --> 09:04.462
Abuelita ran out of medicine.

09:04.547 --> 09:08.345
Tía says if she has another heart attack,
you'll have to answer to the Virgin Mary.

09:08.429 --> 09:12.353
You know, she only gets religious
when she's mad, so, good luck, Dad.

09:12.437 --> 09:13.439
Come on, mijo.

09:15.861 --> 09:17.447
-Did you eat?
-Mm-hmm.

09:18.282 --> 09:19.910
-How was work?
-It was good.

09:27.258 --> 09:28.553
That was life-changing.

09:28.637 --> 09:31.517
I've been doing a lot of Pilates.

09:35.441 --> 09:36.778
-Who's that?

09:37.445 --> 09:38.573
Is that Kathryn?

09:39.240 --> 09:41.036
It doesn't matter.

09:41.537 --> 09:46.046
We have two more uninterrupted hours.
Let's just shut the world out.

09:46.129 --> 09:47.674
Okay. Okay.

09:49.010 --> 09:50.346
Yeah, I can't-- I can't do this.

09:50.429 --> 09:52.392
-You can't what?
-Can't-- I can't do this.

09:52.935 --> 09:54.437
I didn't even look that time.

09:55.982 --> 09:59.197
I need to go. I need to go and get away.

09:59.698 --> 10:02.705
No, no, no. Oh, don't go. Come on, stay.

10:02.788 --> 10:03.998
I'll order another bottle.

10:04.082 --> 10:06.253
You know how many people
I've told about us?

10:06.336 --> 10:07.756
One person. My assistant.

10:07.840 --> 10:10.929
-How do you think I feel?
-I'm a role model. Girls look up to me.

10:11.012 --> 10:14.352
I just started a company
dedicated to telling women's stories.

10:14.436 --> 10:15.939
You were the one who told me to do that.

10:16.022 --> 10:18.695
-Yes, because I believe in you.
-How can I explain this?

10:18.778 --> 10:23.245
"Oh, don't worry. I'm just sleeping around
with someone else's husband.

10:23.328 --> 10:25.917
Using code names
and having clandestine meetings

10:26.001 --> 10:28.088
like some kind of slutty spy."

10:28.172 --> 10:29.382
How do you explain it?

10:29.884 --> 10:32.263
I don't know, Olivia.
Why don't you tell them that maybe…

10:33.600 --> 10:34.935
that you're in love with me?

10:38.693 --> 10:39.945
I do love you.

10:40.029 --> 10:42.366
-I love you so much. I just--
-Yes. I know, and I love you.

10:42.450 --> 10:45.331
And events, they conspired against us.
You know that.

10:45.414 --> 10:47.711
Look, I was gonna tell Kathryn
that I was leaving. I was.

10:47.794 --> 10:49.339
-I know.
-I had the speech. I had rehearsed.

10:49.422 --> 10:52.303
It was gonna be great and then,
you know, well… her mom died.

10:52.386 --> 10:54.098
-Her mom died, then she got depressed.
-Yeah.

10:54.182 --> 10:55.810
Yeah, it was a rough situation, okay?

10:55.894 --> 10:58.148
I'm just waiting for her
to get her sea legs back,

10:58.232 --> 10:59.442
and then I'm gonna tell her.

10:59.527 --> 11:01.029
You know it's been a year?

11:02.156 --> 11:03.158
Literally.

11:04.244 --> 11:07.960
Today's our anniversary.
And if you don't hate me, I have presents.

11:08.043 --> 11:09.003
Mmm.

11:11.759 --> 11:12.761
Okay.

11:14.055 --> 11:18.940
Now, I got some sparkly stuff too,
but this is what I'm most excited about.

11:23.448 --> 11:26.622
It's Bette Davis's journal
from when she was shooting Now, Voyager.

11:27.290 --> 11:29.920
That's-- That's the movie
where I fell in love with her.

11:30.462 --> 11:31.924
-Yeah.
-How did you know that?

11:32.008 --> 11:34.137
Well, I listen.

11:35.222 --> 11:37.310
And… …I did a little research.

11:38.437 --> 11:39.439
You like it?

11:40.984 --> 11:42.069
It's perfect.

11:47.496 --> 11:48.498
Goodbye, Vincent.

11:53.425 --> 11:54.427
-Goodbye, Vin--

11:59.897 --> 12:03.236
Okay. Okay. Okay.

12:05.700 --> 12:07.286
Oli-- Olivia!

12:08.205 --> 12:09.457
I just need a little more time.

12:17.933 --> 12:20.981
I don't get it.
This place was on fire last night.

12:21.064 --> 12:23.360
Rocky says Chateau is dead too.

12:24.863 --> 12:25.865
I'm calling it.

12:31.376 --> 12:33.463
-Please don't go out front.
-Please don't follow me.

12:35.342 --> 12:37.304
-You're being reckless.
-You're being reckless.

12:39.643 --> 12:40.812
Olivia!

12:40.895 --> 12:42.314
Don't follow me!

12:42.398 --> 12:43.609
Dave?

12:43.693 --> 12:45.154
-Billie Jean King?
-Yep.

12:50.330 --> 12:51.542
-Oh!

12:51.625 --> 12:53.378
-Oh, my word!
-What--

12:53.462 --> 12:56.259
-Are you all right? Are you okay?
-Yes, I'm just embarrassed.

12:56.342 --> 12:58.931
I never thought
I would get hit by a parked car.

12:59.015 --> 13:01.812
The hell, man? This is my mom's car!

13:01.896 --> 13:04.150
-I'm sorry. I will pay for the damage.
-People are looking.

13:04.233 --> 13:06.822
No, no, no! No, no. No damage. No scratch.
Five stars.

13:07.490 --> 13:08.534
Oh, nice.

13:08.618 --> 13:11.206
-Can we please go up the stairs?
-This man needs our help.

13:11.289 --> 13:13.753
-I'm okay. Don't worry about me.
-Yeah, see. Let's just go back inside.

13:13.836 --> 13:15.715
-Are you sure?
-I just wanna go home.

13:16.717 --> 13:17.719
You--

13:18.888 --> 13:20.098
Call me when you're divorced.

14:40.425 --> 14:42.889
Oh, you really are a safety risk.

14:42.973 --> 14:46.020
I'm gonna throw in a couple of reflectors
so people can see you coming.

14:46.104 --> 14:47.147
Hey, Lu.

14:49.193 --> 14:51.197
one, eh, reflector.

14:52.074 --> 14:53.577
Your Spanish is terrible.

14:54.830 --> 14:57.711
-It is as good as your English, sir.
-You wish.

14:57.794 --> 14:59.338
She's taking night classes,

14:59.422 --> 15:01.384
but I think not even all-day classes
would help.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.514
My Spanish sucks.
It is a source of great shame.

15:03.597 --> 15:05.560
Thank you for doing that
in front of my daughter.

15:05.643 --> 15:06.562
Yeah.

15:06.645 --> 15:08.023
You know they're trying to kick us out?

15:08.106 --> 15:09.776
Some developer bought out the whole block.

15:11.070 --> 15:13.659
Fifteen years,
and now they try to price us out.

15:13.743 --> 15:17.458
All of us too.
Hope you like juice bars and spin classes.

15:17.542 --> 15:20.923
They want to replace your bike shop
with bikes that don't go anywhere?

15:21.508 --> 15:22.927
Yeah.

15:23.846 --> 15:25.182
Oh, hey. You know what?

15:26.476 --> 15:28.689
Okay,
there's a city council meeting next week.

15:28.773 --> 15:32.739
-We gotta pack the place out, okay?
-Okay. Good.

15:36.705 --> 15:37.999
That mustache.

15:39.628 --> 15:42.341
I'm too much work. And I know that.

15:43.803 --> 15:46.975
Maybe I drew too hard a line, you know?
Maybe I should call him.

15:47.811 --> 15:51.902
Is there someone else that you can talk to
who might know you better?

15:52.695 --> 15:55.075
Jennifer Lawrence.
Aren't you two, like, best friends?

15:55.743 --> 15:57.079
We were in a movie together.

15:57.162 --> 15:59.751
We played best friends.

16:01.129 --> 16:02.422
I don't even think she liked me.

16:02.507 --> 16:06.013
Okay. How about your mom?
She called again last week.

16:06.097 --> 16:08.393
My mother was a drunk.
She embezzled from me.

16:08.476 --> 16:11.482
I testified against her in court.
She went to jail.

16:13.319 --> 16:14.321
You haven't googled me?

16:15.282 --> 16:16.367
I-I will now.

16:16.450 --> 16:19.833
Vanity Fair. Page 32. 2018.

16:20.668 --> 16:22.004
It's actually pretty good.

16:22.881 --> 16:26.387
I mean, depressing.
But hopeful, ultimately.

16:27.472 --> 16:29.393
The source close to the family is me.

16:32.525 --> 16:34.821
What? No. No.

16:34.905 --> 16:36.115
No!

16:36.199 --> 16:39.748
-How do you explain this?
-It's bullshit.

16:39.831 --> 16:42.336
I've never met that woman once
in my entire life.

16:42.419 --> 16:46.219
Look, I walked the councilman to his car
and, sure, did I notice her?

16:46.720 --> 16:49.266
Maybe.
There were lots of celebrities there.

16:49.350 --> 16:52.565
But there was also some Lakers there,
and I was really excited about that.

16:52.649 --> 16:56.447
Says that you were having a lovers' spat.

16:56.531 --> 16:58.661
I never said a word to her.

16:58.744 --> 16:59.996
Look, I mean, you can't even--

17:00.080 --> 17:02.835
Just look at the picture for a second.
Look at the picture.

17:02.919 --> 17:06.510
Let me-- Sure, yeah, that's me,
definitely, but who's that other guy?

17:06.593 --> 17:08.304
-That guy?
-She was with that guy.

17:08.388 --> 17:09.724
She was with that guy?

17:09.808 --> 17:11.853
That guy.
They were the ones who were bickering.

17:11.937 --> 17:13.273
They were in a whole thing.

17:13.941 --> 17:15.485
And we were all watching,
and it was really--

17:15.569 --> 17:17.114
It was kind of uncomfortable
for all of us.

17:17.865 --> 17:18.867
Okay.

17:19.536 --> 17:22.207
You must think that I am so stupid.

17:22.291 --> 17:25.673
I don't think that you're stupid.
I would never call you stupid.

17:25.756 --> 17:30.181
Kathryn, look, it's the press, okay?

17:30.265 --> 17:32.895
The press always gets it wrong.
You know this.

17:36.695 --> 17:38.532
I want to believe you.

17:38.615 --> 17:41.495
You can believe me.
You can always believe me.

17:41.580 --> 17:42.582
Look, I--

17:44.043 --> 17:46.339
I know that I've made mistakes
in the past, I do,

17:46.422 --> 17:50.890
but I'm happy, and I love you, and I would
never do anything to jeopardize that.

17:51.390 --> 17:54.396
And I so wanna talk about this
later tonight. I do.

17:54.480 --> 17:55.816
But obviously, I can't.

17:57.069 --> 17:58.154
I love you. I'm--

17:59.031 --> 18:02.622
I'm gonna call my lawyer from the car
because they owe us an apology.

18:03.791 --> 18:06.922
Earhart opens in five days!

18:07.005 --> 18:10.011
I can't-- I can't have this
getting out there. I need it gone.

18:10.095 --> 18:12.892
She's on a party plane to London
for her nephew's bar mitzvah.

18:12.975 --> 18:13.977
Why is she--

18:15.105 --> 18:17.819
Just tell her to call me the second
she lands! I need my publicist!

18:17.902 --> 18:20.825
-She's saying, "Don't freak out."
-Of course I'm freaking out!

18:20.908 --> 18:22.494
I'm having an anxiety attack!

18:22.578 --> 18:24.541
These are very judgmental times.

18:24.624 --> 18:27.755
You can't just be a good actress.
You have to be a good person too.

18:27.839 --> 18:31.429
-Where the hell are my pills?
-Okay. Bottom left. Next to your retainer.

18:32.055 --> 18:33.474
Okay, anticipate my needs.

18:35.563 --> 18:38.986
I have three studios
circling this company,

18:39.069 --> 18:40.573
waiting to see how the box office does.

18:40.656 --> 18:43.494
If this movie tanks,
you can say goodbye to all of it.

18:43.579 --> 18:47.795
The wellness days. The yoga retreats.
The free water. All of it! Everything!

18:47.879 --> 18:49.089
Why isn't this opening?

18:51.720 --> 18:53.055
She's gonna divorce me.

18:53.139 --> 18:56.270
I'ma lose the company. She and her father,
they're gonna squeeze me out.

18:56.813 --> 18:59.193
Daniel, you're my lawyer.
I need you to fix this.

18:59.276 --> 19:02.575
Well, we could create a time machine
and have you make better choices.

19:02.658 --> 19:04.203
I pay you not to judge me.

19:04.286 --> 19:07.752
Look, if I had a few weeks,
maybe I could buy up enough shares

19:07.835 --> 19:09.506
-through an offshore--
-I don't have a few weeks.

19:17.772 --> 19:18.774
Maybe you do.

19:20.736 --> 19:23.074
What if, and I'm just formulating this,

19:23.659 --> 19:26.413
we find the other guy in the photo

19:26.497 --> 19:28.835
and get him and Olivia
to pretend to be a couple.

19:28.919 --> 19:31.925
That's a dumb idea. Keep going.

19:32.008 --> 19:36.058
All they'd have to do is be seen in public
a few times, get some pictures out there,

19:36.141 --> 19:39.691
and before you know it,
your lie becomes the truth.

19:42.362 --> 19:44.074
I like when my lies become truth.

19:51.715 --> 19:53.719
Okay, that's it.
I'm canceling my two o'clock.

19:53.802 --> 19:56.390
-That is so hot.
-Handcuff yourself to the outdoor shower.

20:00.858 --> 20:02.193
Come on. Give me the milk.

20:02.277 --> 20:04.197
- Oh, yeah? Tell me more, baby.
-Hello?

20:06.493 --> 20:08.582
Tell me how bad you want it, Gordon.

20:08.665 --> 20:10.544
I'm sorry, I'm-- I'm just the valet.

20:10.628 --> 20:15.930
Ooh, a valet? And I'm a horny, rich bitch.
What are you gonna do to me?

20:16.013 --> 20:17.432
- Come on, Gordon. Tell me.
-Hold, please.

20:17.516 --> 20:18.518
Hello?

20:21.440 --> 20:24.530
Have a nice day, Gordon.

20:49.622 --> 20:51.458
Welcome to Kobra, sir.

21:02.397 --> 21:03.900
Did you forget something?

21:03.984 --> 21:05.654
You're Antonio Flores, right?

21:07.407 --> 21:09.411
Olivia Allan is gonna go out with me?

21:10.038 --> 21:11.958
-That's right.
-The famous actress?

21:12.042 --> 21:13.754
-Yes.
-The beautiful one?

21:13.837 --> 21:16.551
Yes. You'll go out on a few dates.

21:16.634 --> 21:17.887
With me?

21:17.970 --> 21:21.226
Correct.
And she'll pretend to be in love with you.

21:21.811 --> 21:24.066
In love like, you know, like…

21:26.529 --> 21:29.994
-hugging?
-Hugging. Probably some kissing.

21:30.078 --> 21:30.913
Kissing?

21:33.083 --> 21:34.086
And…

21:36.966 --> 21:38.177
how much do I have to pay?

21:38.260 --> 21:40.306
No. We pay you.

21:44.899 --> 21:46.276
Did Benny put you up to this?

21:46.360 --> 21:47.780
Where's Benny?

21:47.863 --> 21:49.992
You're one of his friends
from the cigar store, right?

21:50.076 --> 21:52.372
You got me.
Hijo de la...

21:52.455 --> 21:55.879
Mr. Flores, I work for a billionaire.

21:57.550 --> 21:59.302
We desperately need your help.

22:00.138 --> 22:01.473
You can name your price.

22:05.899 --> 22:08.864
$12,850?

22:08.947 --> 22:11.368
The exactness of the number
surprised me too.

22:13.205 --> 22:14.332
Now it's your turn.

22:16.461 --> 22:20.052
Well, Olivia's not gonna be so easy.

22:20.136 --> 22:22.307
-I'll do it.
-Really?

22:22.390 --> 22:26.524
If we can pull this off,
it'll be a big story.

22:26.608 --> 22:28.778
The press will eat it up.
It'll bury any talk about us.

22:28.862 --> 22:29.864
It's good. It's good.

22:31.618 --> 22:34.957
I knew that you loved me.
I knew that you would do this for me.

22:35.041 --> 22:38.965
I'm not doing it for you.
I'm doing it for Amelia Earhart.

22:40.677 --> 22:44.142
Now tell me about this man
in the photograph.

22:44.852 --> 22:48.610
Antonio Miguel Flores.
Age 47. Lives with his mom.

22:48.693 --> 22:52.618
$320 in the bank,
yet has an excellent credit rating.

22:53.703 --> 22:54.789
That's a rare combination.

22:54.872 --> 22:59.966
Okay, there is no way
she's dating someone who parks cars.

23:00.049 --> 23:04.057
I've been in this game a long time, ma'am.
I've seen weirder couples.

23:04.767 --> 23:05.686
Much weirder.

23:05.769 --> 23:07.397
To be honest,

23:07.480 --> 23:09.694
it's the excellent credit rating
I can't get my head around.

23:13.576 --> 23:14.411
Hello.

23:14.494 --> 23:17.793
Look in your rearview mirror.
There's a Crown Victoria.

23:18.837 --> 23:19.964
I'm being followed?

23:20.047 --> 23:21.884
Love you, babe. You're doing great.

23:22.594 --> 23:26.018
That's Stegman. Ex LAPD.
Works for Mrs. Royce.

23:26.602 --> 23:28.898
Take three deep breaths.

23:29.775 --> 23:32.196
-How do we know?
-We have eyes on their eyes.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.998
The gentleman in the Subaru two cars back,
that's Kapoor. He works for us.

23:37.081 --> 23:38.668
I'm your son-- This is not my--

23:38.752 --> 23:40.379
Dad, get off the phone. Dad?

23:40.463 --> 23:44.179
Guys, I'm working. I gotta go.
This is why I go to therapy!

23:44.262 --> 23:47.018
So your sister really wants you
to give this music teacher a shot.

23:47.101 --> 23:48.312
Maybe I was too hard on her.

23:48.395 --> 23:49.982
This is from their retreat
in Lake Arrowhead.

23:50.066 --> 23:53.405
She's a little pear-shaped,
but she has nice elbows.

24:23.967 --> 24:24.969
Uh…

24:30.229 --> 24:31.481
-Hello. Welcome.
-Hi.

24:31.566 --> 24:33.611
-Your ticket?
-I'll just be one second.

25:22.375 --> 25:23.670
Hi.

25:23.753 --> 25:26.258
You must be Antonio's boss.
I've heard so much about you.

25:26.341 --> 25:28.387
Do you mind if I steal this one away
for lunch?

25:29.974 --> 25:31.686
You're a sweetheart. Thank you.

25:31.769 --> 25:32.771
Let's go.

25:35.359 --> 25:36.654
W-W-What's happening here?

25:36.737 --> 25:41.037
Oh, it's new. We don't want to,
um, label it.

25:59.240 --> 26:00.785
You-- You keep your car very clean.

26:01.453 --> 26:04.208
Oh, you know, I'm so embarrassed
that you got roped into this.

26:04.292 --> 26:06.212
You don't have to make small talk
if you don't…

26:06.296 --> 26:09.553
No, no, no. It's just that
you can tell a lot about a person

26:09.636 --> 26:10.805
by how they treat their car.

26:10.889 --> 26:12.475
My assistant takes care of it.

26:12.559 --> 26:14.312
-Hmm. They do a good job.

26:14.855 --> 26:17.986
All right, we're all set.
My publicist tipped off the paparazzi.

26:20.199 --> 26:21.284
There will be paparazzi?

26:21.869 --> 26:23.455
That's kind of the entire point.

26:23.539 --> 26:25.919
I-- I don't even like being
in family photos.

26:26.002 --> 26:28.508
All you have to do is walk into
the restaurant and have lunch with me.

26:28.591 --> 26:31.012
-Look, I park cars for people like you…
-Uh-huh.

26:31.096 --> 26:32.891
…and I'm old enough to be your father.

26:32.974 --> 26:34.937
Do you think anyone will believe
we're dating?

26:35.020 --> 26:37.567
Not if you can't stop sweating!
You look like a dolphin. Here, towel off.

26:37.651 --> 26:40.114
-Get it. And take your little uniform off.
-Yeah, yeah.

26:40.197 --> 26:41.366
Is your shit together?

26:41.951 --> 26:43.663
My shit is together.

26:49.800 --> 26:51.804
-Okay.

26:52.681 --> 26:53.683
Showtime.

26:56.605 --> 26:58.275
-Olivia, Olivia!
-Here!

26:58.358 --> 26:59.862
Olivia, right here. Right here!

26:59.945 --> 27:01.907
-Olivia!
-Olivia! Over here!

27:01.991 --> 27:03.285
-Olivia!
-Olivia!

27:03.368 --> 27:04.830
-Welcome to Le Bilboquet.

27:04.913 --> 27:06.917
Olivia!

27:07.001 --> 27:08.462
Who's that? Is he somebody?

27:08.546 --> 27:10.592
Never seen him before.
What happened to Vincent Royce?

27:10.675 --> 27:13.764
I've never met a Mr. Royce.
This is my boyfriend, Antonio.

27:13.848 --> 27:15.894
Antonio! Hey, Antonio, you an actor?

27:15.977 --> 27:17.898
-He's a valet.
-No, really?

27:17.981 --> 27:20.444
Yes, I've dated enough actors.
They're too much work.

27:20.528 --> 27:21.655
Hey, hey, hey.

27:25.747 --> 27:28.794
-Olivia! Olivia!
-Yes, thank you. No comments.

27:28.878 --> 27:30.632
Yeah, right here. One more. One more.

27:30.715 --> 27:31.884
Right here. Right here.

27:31.967 --> 27:33.638
-Hi.
-Loved you in that dog movie.

27:33.721 --> 27:35.140
-Thank you.
-Was that dog yours?

27:35.224 --> 27:37.353
-Hi.
-My teenage daughter loves you.

27:37.436 --> 27:38.731
-Aw, thank you.
-It's you!

27:45.410 --> 27:46.539
Olivia, one more?

27:46.622 --> 27:47.958
Everyone's looking at us.

27:49.126 --> 27:50.838
-I don't like it.
-You get used to it.

27:50.922 --> 27:52.341
Don't they have enough?

27:52.424 --> 27:55.389
Oh, they never have enough,
until they don't want any.

27:57.101 --> 27:59.940
Uh, can you say something?
I'm gonna laugh really hard.

28:01.359 --> 28:02.236
I don't understand.

28:09.375 --> 28:11.505
What did he say? What did he say to you?

28:11.589 --> 28:12.716
That's the one they're gonna run.

28:12.799 --> 28:15.262
They always use the laughing shot.

28:15.345 --> 28:17.474
Ms. Allan, are you ready to order?

28:17.559 --> 28:19.103
I'll have a small, chopped salad.

28:19.186 --> 28:21.692
Vinaigrette, unless it's balsamic,
then I'll have it on the side.

28:22.276 --> 28:23.445
-Sure thing.
-Thanks, Bill.

28:23.529 --> 28:24.363
Sir?

28:25.073 --> 28:26.075
Um…

28:27.537 --> 28:29.165
What is the--

28:31.461 --> 28:32.839
Do you sell hamburgers here?

28:32.922 --> 28:35.762
Yeah, we can do that for you.
How would you like it prepared?

28:35.845 --> 28:37.641
With lettuce and tomato, please.

28:37.724 --> 28:39.352
Uh, I meant the meat.

28:39.435 --> 28:42.525
On a bun. Under the lettuce and tomato.

28:43.109 --> 28:44.821
Uh, how would you
like it cooked, sir?

28:45.907 --> 28:47.619
Very cooked. All the way through.

28:47.702 --> 28:49.038
Ah! Well-done.

28:50.290 --> 28:51.292
Thank you.

28:54.298 --> 28:55.300
Mm-hmm.

28:59.810 --> 29:02.774
Maybe the less you say, the better.

29:04.611 --> 29:05.905
Okay.

29:05.988 --> 29:06.990
Okay.

29:09.161 --> 29:12.459
Ah, I'm gonna wash my hands.
I touch a lot of keys, you know?

29:12.961 --> 29:14.715
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah.

29:20.434 --> 29:22.187
Excuse me. Can I get some more water?

29:22.939 --> 29:24.609
Uh, no, actually, I'm--

29:24.693 --> 29:26.697
I've been waiting for a refill
for five minutes.

29:34.211 --> 29:35.464
There you go.

29:35.548 --> 29:37.635
So, anyways, I called her.
She never called me back.

29:37.719 --> 29:39.848
Excuse me? Refill.

29:40.348 --> 29:42.102
Oh, great! I need a refill too.

29:46.319 --> 29:48.949
Excuse me. Hi. Yeah.
Can you do that for him?

29:49.826 --> 29:50.828
Over here.

29:52.707 --> 29:54.084
Yo! Agua.

29:58.969 --> 30:00.305
Is that all you're eating?

30:00.388 --> 30:01.600
My premiere's on Saturday.

30:01.683 --> 30:04.104
I have a very unforgiving dress
to squeeze into,

30:04.188 --> 30:06.400
so this is pretty much
my last non-juice meal.

30:07.529 --> 30:08.572
Is that healthy?

30:09.198 --> 30:11.703
No. By the way, you're gonna be my date.

30:12.622 --> 30:14.124
To your Hollywood movie premiere?

30:14.208 --> 30:16.672
Yeah, if we're seen
on the red carpet together,

30:16.755 --> 30:20.220
um, it'll kill any last rumors
about me and Vincent.

30:20.888 --> 30:24.228
So, I need to get a tuxedo, right?

30:24.311 --> 30:26.942
My people will sort that out for you.

30:27.025 --> 30:28.319
Are you sure?

30:28.403 --> 30:31.910
I have a cousin, Chucho.
He owns a tuxedo-rental store.

30:31.994 --> 30:35.918
No insult to Chucho, uh,
but let my people take care of you.

30:36.002 --> 30:38.256
But he can give me a good discount.

30:38.757 --> 30:41.220
And probably he will offer me the shoes
for free.

30:44.686 --> 30:47.482
How committed are we to the mustache?

30:49.821 --> 30:50.823
You don't like it?

30:51.909 --> 30:54.246
No. No one does.

30:57.712 --> 31:00.258
Thanks again for lunch.

31:11.405 --> 31:14.244
Have you had sex with her?
No, don't tell me if you had sex with her.

31:14.328 --> 31:15.790
-I don't wanna know.
-Okay. Okay.

31:16.290 --> 31:17.292
You're having sex--

31:17.376 --> 31:19.254
You're having sex with her, you bastard.

31:19.338 --> 31:21.425
I know you're having sex with her.
Tell me!

31:21.510 --> 31:24.641
-I don't know what you wanna hear.
-I don't wanna hear anything.

31:38.836 --> 31:40.631
And what are you saying that's so funny?

31:40.715 --> 31:43.302
You've never once made me laugh. Not once.

31:47.854 --> 31:51.277
Maybe they could bring on
a young female voice to help him.

31:51.360 --> 31:52.947
-Ms. Allan!
-I'm not saying-- What--

31:53.448 --> 31:57.039
-Hey. I replaced your filter.
-Thank you.

31:57.122 --> 31:58.584
-You are good to go.
-I'll take that.

31:58.667 --> 32:02.466
So, I was thinking,
if it doesn't work out with the valet,

32:02.550 --> 32:06.223
and you want an upgrade,
number's on the bill.

32:15.116 --> 32:16.327
Have a good night, ladies.

32:17.914 --> 32:19.333
It's working.

32:20.376 --> 32:21.880
Hey. Did you know about this?

32:21.963 --> 32:24.761
Yeah, the whole school knows.
I had no idea Dad had this kind of game.

32:24.844 --> 32:26.598
He doesn't have game.

32:27.517 --> 32:30.689
He has, like, no game.
He's, like, game-free.

32:31.357 --> 32:34.113
-He's, like, minus game.
-Look, you'll always be my mom,

32:34.196 --> 32:36.408
but if she ends up being my second mom,
I'd be kind of psyched.

32:36.492 --> 32:38.246
It's good for actors
to be around other actors.

32:41.962 --> 32:47.472
I owe you a huge apology.
I mean, I acted like a crazy person.

32:47.557 --> 32:48.976
Oh, no, no, no, do-- Please,

32:49.059 --> 32:51.648
I'm just so sorry
that you had to go through all of that.

32:51.731 --> 32:54.278
I mean, it must have been
a real emotional roller coaster.

32:54.361 --> 32:57.159
You're sweet. I just love you so much.

32:57.242 --> 32:59.371
I love you so much.

33:00.081 --> 33:02.545
Listen, I gotta run, okay?
But I'll see you when I get home, okay?

33:02.628 --> 33:03.714
-Kisses!
- Kisses to you.

33:04.381 --> 33:06.427
-What do you got?
-Looks legit, ma'am.

33:06.511 --> 33:09.057
Ms. Allan's even takin' the Mexican dude
to her premiere.

33:10.686 --> 33:12.439
There's a lie here somewhere.

35:15.393 --> 35:16.896
Okay.

35:18.859 --> 35:22.323
Wow. You look very nice.

35:22.407 --> 35:25.496
Thank you. It just took a team of people
12 hours to assemble me.

35:25.581 --> 35:27.960
This is good. This will work.

35:30.089 --> 35:33.137
Of course I'm lying down.
It's to avoid wrinkles.

35:33.889 --> 35:35.224
Yeah. How are the early reviews?

35:35.308 --> 35:37.479
No, don't tell me. I don't wanna know.
Unless they're really good.

35:37.563 --> 35:39.232
-They--
-Don't tell me. Don't tell me.

35:39.316 --> 35:41.195
I don't wanna know.
Unless they're really, really good.

35:41.278 --> 35:42.865
- Okay, so…
-Shut your face. No, don't tell me.

35:42.948 --> 35:44.619
-Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.
-Champagne?

35:44.702 --> 35:47.583
- Is that Antonio? Is he with you?
-Yeah. Yeah, no. He's right here.

35:47.666 --> 35:49.504
- I worry about what he's gonna say.
-It's my publicist.

35:49.587 --> 35:51.716
She's worried
you're gonna say something stupid.

35:51.800 --> 35:54.972
Me too. I'm nervous. Very nervous.

35:55.056 --> 35:56.350
I'm sweating. Look.

35:56.433 --> 35:57.895
Oh, Jesus.

35:57.978 --> 36:00.859
Okay, well, can you talk to him
and tell him to stop sweating?

36:01.736 --> 36:03.657
Hello. I'm Antonio.

36:03.740 --> 36:07.247
Just try not to say anything.
They'll mostly be focused on Olivia.

36:07.330 --> 36:09.292
No, no, I don't wanna say anything.

36:09.376 --> 36:11.255
But if you have to,
just say something like

36:11.338 --> 36:13.467
you're here to support Olivia
on her big night.

36:13.552 --> 36:15.764
Here to support Olivia. Her big night.

36:15.848 --> 36:17.267
-Okay.
-Oh, no.

36:17.350 --> 36:20.022
I am-- I'm here--
"I'm here" or "I am here"?

36:20.691 --> 36:23.780
I'm here to support Olivia
on her big night. On her big--

36:23.864 --> 36:28.455
I'm here to support Olivia?
In her big night? I'm here-- I'm here to--

36:29.625 --> 36:32.088
Please, sign my photo!

36:32.171 --> 36:33.967
Olivia! Olivia!

36:35.386 --> 36:36.388
Olivia!

36:37.181 --> 36:38.560
Please, sign my photos!

36:39.311 --> 36:40.522
Right here, Olivia!

36:43.360 --> 36:44.487
We love you!

36:46.784 --> 36:48.663
-Olivia!
-Olivia, right here!

36:48.747 --> 36:50.082
Right here, right here!

36:53.506 --> 36:56.261
Olivia, right here,
right here! Right here, right here!

37:06.365 --> 37:07.241
This way.

37:07.325 --> 37:08.494
-Olivia, over here!
-Olivia!

37:08.578 --> 37:11.041
-Antonio!
-Shoulders back, core engaged and smile.

37:11.124 --> 37:14.339
Just look natural, like you're looking
in the mirror. And this way.

37:14.422 --> 37:16.803
Hey! There's America's sweethearts.

37:16.886 --> 37:19.850
Labels out. I don't want
an angry phone call later, Tony.

37:19.934 --> 37:21.646
Let's go. The vultures are waiting.

37:21.729 --> 37:23.566
Come on.
Come on. One more shot.

37:35.214 --> 37:37.427
I'm told you are wearing Galvan.

37:37.511 --> 37:39.682
Oh, you look absolutely stunning.

37:39.765 --> 37:41.101
Thank you so much.

37:41.184 --> 37:43.230
And, Antonio, this is your first premiere,
right?

37:46.445 --> 37:48.073
I mean, it's pretty exciting, right?

37:57.634 --> 38:00.056
I have no idea
what either of you are saying.

38:00.139 --> 38:01.266
-Olivia.
-Mm-hmm.

38:01.349 --> 38:04.523
-New movie. New man. New company.

38:04.607 --> 38:06.276
-This is a big year for you.
-Antonio.

38:06.359 --> 38:08.363
Thank you. Yeah, I mean, I'm--
It's just such an honor to…

38:08.447 --> 38:09.282
Antonio!

38:12.080 --> 38:13.499
-…about an incredible woman.
-Hey.

38:30.157 --> 38:32.621
…all started
with my great-great-grandmother,

38:32.704 --> 38:35.877
who was really into aviation
and airplanes.

38:46.356 --> 38:47.693
I really wanted to explore that…

38:53.370 --> 38:54.623
-Hi.
-Olivia.

38:57.949 --> 38:59.102
Oh, thank you so much.

38:59.186 --> 39:00.969
We're gonna go and watch the movie now.

39:17.418 --> 39:22.428
I know you said you didn't want nothing,
but I brought you some just in case.

39:25.184 --> 39:27.355
They were not charging for anything.

39:35.371 --> 39:37.918
I have a bad feeling, Meeley.

39:38.001 --> 39:40.632
There's something
in the air that ain't right.

39:42.301 --> 39:44.055
Remember the Iowa State Fair

39:45.976 --> 39:47.813
when I saw my first aircraft?

39:48.397 --> 39:51.236
It was a rickety old flivver,
and I was too scared to get on.

39:51.946 --> 39:55.369
But you took my hand,
and we went on together.

39:56.956 --> 39:59.586
Be with me again today
as I fly across the Pacific.

40:01.339 --> 40:02.425
You're aces, Mom.

40:24.302 --> 40:26.014
Hi. You look great. Let's go.

40:32.318 --> 40:34.573
Um, here's your table.
Can I get you anything?

40:34.656 --> 40:37.913
Yeah, a giant pizza. I'm starving.
I don't want any of this finger food.

40:37.996 --> 40:40.501
-Already ordered.
-See? You're anticipating.

40:41.211 --> 40:42.171
Mm-hmm.

40:42.254 --> 40:43.800
Antonio, can I get you anything?

40:43.883 --> 40:45.970
I-I'm just here to support Olivia
on her big night.

40:46.471 --> 40:47.473
Sweet.

40:48.016 --> 40:49.770
Where was that on the red carpet?

40:49.853 --> 40:53.110
I mean, he's not bad-looking,
but what am I missing?

40:53.736 --> 40:57.118
Historically, the world's great lovers
haven't been attractive men.

40:57.201 --> 41:01.209
Casanova was ugly.
But in bed, he was a legend.

41:01.292 --> 41:02.504
Hmm.

41:03.088 --> 41:05.593
Well, we only have to stay for 20 minutes,
and then we can…

41:06.469 --> 41:07.681
-Oh, my God.
-What?

41:07.764 --> 41:08.975
-He's here…
-Who's here?

41:09.058 --> 41:10.269
-…with Kathryn.
-Who's Kathryn?

41:10.352 --> 41:11.605
-Vincent's wife.
-Who's Vincent?

41:11.689 --> 41:12.899
-The married man.
-What married man?

41:12.983 --> 41:14.193
-My boyfriend.
-What boyfriend?

41:14.277 --> 41:15.947
I-- This was all explained to you.

41:16.030 --> 41:18.410
Uh, th-th-there were many names.
It was very confusing.

41:18.493 --> 41:20.080
-Mmm. Mmm.
-Where are they?

41:20.164 --> 41:22.126
They're over by the bar,
and she does not look depressed.

41:22.209 --> 41:23.295
Does she look depressed to you?

41:28.388 --> 41:34.651
Well, maybe,
maybe her eyes look a little sad.

41:34.735 --> 41:35.904
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

41:36.614 --> 41:37.991
-Oh, they're coming.
-Okay, um…

41:38.074 --> 41:40.078
Um, sh-sh-should I do something?
Should I hold your hand?

41:40.162 --> 41:42.333
Yeah, hold my hand. Hold my hand.
Hold my hand. Don't do that.

41:42.416 --> 41:45.715
Just make-- Kiss me-- Make out with me.
Get away from me. Just get away.

41:45.798 --> 41:47.928
-Hi. I'm Kathryn Royce.
-Hi.

41:48.011 --> 41:49.890
-This is my husband, Vincent.
-Hi.

41:49.973 --> 41:52.061
We've seen all of your movies.

41:52.144 --> 41:53.271
That's so nice.

41:53.355 --> 41:57.530
I have to tell you, though, I think that
this one might just be my favorite.

41:58.114 --> 41:59.618
It's very empowering.

42:00.578 --> 42:03.333
Uh, honey, we shouldn't monopolize her.
Come on.

42:03.416 --> 42:05.630
I just-- I-- I love this.

42:05.713 --> 42:07.759
-The actress and the valet.

42:07.842 --> 42:12.017
I mean, we are dying to know
how the two of you met.

42:13.646 --> 42:16.777
-Oh, well, I was driving in Beverly Hills…
-In Beverly Hills.

42:16.860 --> 42:17.696
Ooh.

42:17.779 --> 42:19.407
-…and I got a flat tire.
-Flat tire.

42:19.490 --> 42:20.492
Oh, no. Ugh.

42:20.577 --> 42:25.043
-This handsome man pulled up in a Ferrari.
-Me. Yeah. Ferrari. And…

42:25.127 --> 42:26.922
-By the time he had the spare on…
-Spare on.

42:27.006 --> 42:30.429
-…I was smitten.
-Yeah. Mitten. She was very mitten.

42:30.513 --> 42:32.057
-That is so sweet.
-You see that?

42:32.141 --> 42:33.602
-Look at that. Isn't that sweet?
-Yes.

42:33.686 --> 42:35.773
Yeah, see? Love always finds its way.

42:35.857 --> 42:38.320
-Oh, he's such a romantic.
-Mm-hmm.

42:38.403 --> 42:40.407
It was nice meeting you both. Take care.

42:40.490 --> 42:42.328
-Just out of curiosity…
-Shit.

42:42.411 --> 42:47.839
…how long did it take for him to tell you
that he was just parking the car?

42:50.260 --> 42:52.056
-I'm just here--
-Excuse me. I'm so sorry.

42:52.139 --> 42:53.559
I really need to steal these two.

42:53.642 --> 42:55.437
No, you know what? He told me right away,

42:55.521 --> 42:58.611
and thank God, because I can't stand men
who have showy cars.

42:58.694 --> 43:03.996
Ah, you would hate Vincent then.
He has an entire garage just full of 'em.

43:04.080 --> 43:05.541
-Okay.

43:05.625 --> 43:07.294
-Uh, we really have to go, so, um--
-Yeah. Yeah.

43:07.378 --> 43:09.298
I'm just here to support Olivia
on her big night.

43:09.382 --> 43:10.718
Uh-huh. Right this way. So sorry.

43:14.100 --> 43:16.647
-Hey. Blast from the past, man.
-Hey.

43:16.730 --> 43:17.732
What are you doing here?

43:17.816 --> 43:21.907
Ah, you know, man. Someone's screwing
someone they're not supposed to. You?

43:21.990 --> 43:25.080
Same. Homo sapiens, bro.
We're flawed creatures.

43:25.163 --> 43:27.669
Hey, extra falafel. You want one?

43:27.752 --> 43:28.963
Is that Falafel King?

43:29.046 --> 43:30.382
Is it Falafel King?

43:30.465 --> 43:31.760
-Hell yeah.
-Come on, bro.

43:32.428 --> 43:33.471
-Come on, bro.

43:33.556 --> 43:35.392
Oh, you know what? I forgot the napkins.

43:35.475 --> 43:37.939
You still, uh, keep an extra stash
in the glove compartment?

43:38.733 --> 43:40.945
I have upgraded to moist towelettes.

43:41.028 --> 43:42.699
Love that.

43:48.168 --> 43:50.673
-Perfect. Thanks, man.
-It's the best in the city.

43:50.757 --> 43:53.637
-They do not skimp on the tahini.
-Don't skimp on the tahini.

43:53.721 --> 43:54.973
Oh, time flies. Gotta go.

43:55.056 --> 43:56.602
Oh. Thanks.

43:56.685 --> 43:58.396
-Where are my pills?
-It's in your hand.

43:58.480 --> 43:59.482
Oh.

44:00.693 --> 44:02.530
My apologies.
I thought this was the men's room.

44:02.614 --> 44:03.616
She knows.

44:07.039 --> 44:08.291
All right. Okay.

44:08.793 --> 44:12.675
Uh, I'm sorry.
Look, Kathryn got the tickets.

44:12.759 --> 44:15.222
She sprung them on me at the last minute.

44:15.305 --> 44:17.267
I'm in hell here.

44:17.351 --> 44:19.230
I should wait outside for this.

44:19.313 --> 44:20.983
She's nothing like you described.

44:21.652 --> 44:23.656
She's elegant. Regal.

44:23.739 --> 44:25.660
-Why would you divorce someone like that?
-Why?

44:25.743 --> 44:27.622
Because I'm in love with you.

44:28.498 --> 44:33.884
Because nothing I've ever done or said
or felt makes any sense without you.

44:35.721 --> 44:38.727
There's a level of intimacy here
that's getting very uncomfortable for me,

44:38.811 --> 44:39.813
so I'm just--

44:39.896 --> 44:42.317
I had this whole narrative in my head
about how awful she was

44:42.401 --> 44:44.113
to justify my behavior.

44:44.196 --> 44:45.282
But now I find out…

44:45.783 --> 44:47.579
She's great at a cocktail party.

44:47.662 --> 44:49.791
Okay? But she's a monster at home.

44:49.874 --> 44:53.172
We're so close.
We're so close, Olivia.

44:54.091 --> 44:56.387
She's totally buying all of this.

44:57.724 --> 44:59.018
It's gonna be me and you.

45:00.521 --> 45:02.399
I can't handle this.

45:03.359 --> 45:04.738
You were incredible in the movie.

45:06.449 --> 45:07.451
I know.

45:11.710 --> 45:14.131
Fuck.

45:19.851 --> 45:20.853
Thanks, bro.

45:30.706 --> 45:33.504
Whatever my husband is paying you,
I'll double it.

45:34.839 --> 45:36.593
Fine. I'll quadruple it.

45:39.139 --> 45:42.772
-I-I don't know what you're talking about.
-I'll give you $100,000.

45:46.487 --> 45:47.489
Cash.

45:49.911 --> 45:54.253
There is no way that Olivia Allan
is wasting her time with a valet.

46:02.394 --> 46:03.396
Ma'am,

46:04.398 --> 46:08.406
I don't get paid a lot,
so I would love to take your money.

46:09.617 --> 46:10.619
But I won't.

46:11.203 --> 46:12.874
It's probably hard to believe,

46:14.293 --> 46:16.715
but maybe Olivia
is not as superficial as you.

46:17.340 --> 46:18.384
And maybe…

46:19.303 --> 46:23.144
Maybe you're underestimating the passion

46:23.896 --> 46:26.777
and charisma of a Latin man.

46:29.490 --> 46:30.910
Buenas noches, señora.

46:46.942 --> 46:47.944
Are you okay?

46:52.620 --> 46:54.373
I had one too many happy pills.

46:55.333 --> 46:57.547
Five too many champagnes.

46:58.882 --> 46:59.884
I wanna go home.

47:00.803 --> 47:03.224
Okay. I will call the limo.

47:03.307 --> 47:08.484
No! No drunk Olivia photos.
Women's stories.

47:10.781 --> 47:13.244
Hey, hey, hey, hey!
Look. It's the valet guy.

47:13.327 --> 47:14.873
Excuse me. Excuse me.

47:24.433 --> 47:27.982
Antonio, Antonio, I love you. I love you.

47:28.942 --> 47:29.986
I'm famous too.

47:50.778 --> 47:51.821
Hey.

48:07.269 --> 48:09.941
Olivia, we need your address. Wake up.

48:19.459 --> 48:20.461
Hey, Olivia.

48:39.792 --> 48:41.755
I need me an Olivia Allan shot.

48:41.838 --> 48:42.840
It's good for the resume.

48:42.882 --> 48:44.886
She's gotta be coming out soon.

49:13.192 --> 49:15.656
Two eggs and cheese and an English muffin.

49:16.616 --> 49:20.874
And some hash browns and…

49:36.573 --> 49:37.407
Okay.

49:57.113 --> 49:57.948
Okay.

50:00.871 --> 50:02.373
-Hey!

50:02.457 --> 50:06.215
Uh, O-O-Olivia, uh, these are my friends,
Javy and Rudy.

50:06.298 --> 50:08.177
-Hey.
-Rudy.

50:08.260 --> 50:10.223
-Yeah. Yeah.
-Rudy's a cutie.

50:10.306 --> 50:11.726
-Me?
-You're a cutie.

50:11.809 --> 50:14.815
-We need to know your addr--
-You should go home with my assistant.

50:15.651 --> 50:18.155
-Her name is Amanda. She's very beautiful.
-You--

50:18.239 --> 50:20.702
We need your address.
We need to know where you live, so--

50:20.786 --> 50:22.665
-No, no. No, no, no. Don't. Wait.
-Anything else?

50:22.748 --> 50:23.959
We need your address! Olivia.

50:24.042 --> 50:25.963
-And a Snackin' Bacon…
-Olivia, your address, please.

50:26.046 --> 50:27.716
…and one cappuccino. That's it.

50:27.800 --> 50:30.931
-Your total is--
-And as much ketchup as you can give us!

50:31.014 --> 50:33.770
The ketchup's for my friend.
Yes. How much?

50:33.853 --> 50:35.857
Uh, your total is $39.

51:09.424 --> 51:10.426
Sleep.

51:10.510 --> 51:12.180
Oh, oh!

51:12.263 --> 51:13.432
Okay, um…

51:13.516 --> 51:15.186
-Sleep time.
-Uh, wait.

51:15.269 --> 51:16.355
Dress can come off.

51:17.148 --> 51:21.156
No, no, no, no! The-The dress stays on.
You sleep in your clothes.

51:21.239 --> 51:24.287
-No, no. No. No, no.
-Take it off.

51:24.371 --> 51:25.373
No, no, no, no, no.

51:33.848 --> 51:37.271
Okay. Yeah, all good.

53:13.005 --> 53:14.925
-Junior Mints?

53:33.796 --> 53:36.051
No. No.

53:38.598 --> 53:39.767
Oh, God, no.

53:42.146 --> 53:43.148
Oh, God.

53:43.231 --> 53:44.317
Good morning.

53:44.400 --> 53:45.402
Hello.

53:45.486 --> 53:47.991
I-I-I just want you to know
that nothing happened.

53:48.075 --> 53:52.041
I-I didn't even look.
And I slept in my pants. See?

53:52.668 --> 53:53.670
Okay.

53:54.420 --> 53:57.970
Thanks for, um,
taking care of me last night.

53:58.846 --> 54:00.391
You would've done the same for me.

54:00.975 --> 54:05.735
Well, I doubt it, but, I mean, sure, okay.

54:05.819 --> 54:09.868
What's your-- What's your address
so I can tell my assistant?

54:10.620 --> 54:12.708
It's 1122 Valencia.

54:12.791 --> 54:13.793
Oh, South Valencia.

54:13.876 --> 54:17.049
South Valencia. Because if you go
to North Valencia, it's a batting cage.

54:17.926 --> 54:19.930
And is there a coffee place near here?

54:20.807 --> 54:23.855
Oh, no. I-I can make you a cup of coffee.

54:23.938 --> 54:25.650
Oh, thank you. Do you have almond milk?

54:25.734 --> 54:26.652
No.

54:26.736 --> 54:28.363
Uh, okay.

54:28.447 --> 54:29.700
I do have aspirin.

54:29.783 --> 54:32.455
Oh! Yes. Yes. Yes.

54:32.539 --> 54:34.752
All the aspirin in the world, please.

54:34.835 --> 54:38.926
And I'm gonna clean this face
because, well, it's obvious.

54:48.738 --> 54:49.615
Sorry.

55:00.385 --> 55:03.559
Sorry about this. I'm really sorry.

55:03.643 --> 55:05.062
This is Clara, my sister.

55:05.145 --> 55:06.397
-Hi.
-And you know Benny.

55:06.481 --> 55:08.694
And my nephews, Luca and Dante.

55:08.778 --> 55:10.364
My landlord, Mr. Kim.

55:10.447 --> 55:11.324
-Hi.
-Hi.

55:11.407 --> 55:13.453
And, I'm assuming, his family?

55:13.538 --> 55:14.665
-Picture?
-I wasn't gonna ask,

55:14.748 --> 55:16.459
but if you're gonna do that,
I want a picture too.

55:16.544 --> 55:17.796
Later.

55:17.879 --> 55:20.677
My tía Christina. My tía Tere.
My tía Zenaida.

55:20.760 --> 55:22.806
-Hi.
-And Chucho and his girlfriend.

55:22.889 --> 55:24.308
-Oh, Chucho. Nice.
-And these people,

55:24.392 --> 55:25.895
I've never seen before in my life.

55:26.564 --> 55:28.568
It's such a pleasure
to meet all of you all at once.

55:28.651 --> 55:29.862
I'm gonna make you a plate.

55:29.945 --> 55:31.824
Oh, you know, I'm just heading off, and…

55:31.907 --> 55:33.911
You're heading to this chair.
You're gonna eat with us.

55:33.995 --> 55:34.997
Here you go.

55:45.643 --> 55:47.647
-Coffee?
-Thank you.

55:47.731 --> 55:50.485
- La suegra's chilaquiles.
-Oh, wow!

55:50.570 --> 55:53.993
Although I prefer a little tostones
on the side like we do in Puerto Rico.

55:54.076 --> 55:56.039
-But these are amazing.
-Uh-- Uh, um…

55:56.122 --> 55:58.001
-Well, I-I don't know.

55:58.084 --> 56:00.464
-Here you go.
-Oh, there's more.

56:00.548 --> 56:02.134
Is that enough huevo revuelto for you?

56:02.217 --> 56:03.721
That's enough for a whole month.

56:05.934 --> 56:07.102
Wasn't joking. Okay.

56:08.981 --> 56:10.233
Okay.

56:14.576 --> 56:15.912
-Mm-hmm.
-Eh?

56:16.830 --> 56:18.124
-Yay! Gorgeous.
-Oh, my God!

56:18.208 --> 56:20.087
-It's really good.
-She loves it!

56:20.170 --> 56:21.422
Ooh! What's the occasion?

56:21.507 --> 56:22.717
Oh, it-- it's Sunday.

56:22.801 --> 56:23.970
Oh! Huh.

56:24.805 --> 56:28.144
I don't spend that much time
with my family under one roof.

56:28.228 --> 56:30.650
Oh, not us. There's something in our DNA.

56:31.150 --> 56:33.781
Kinda like having one of those
shock collars they use to train dogs.

56:33.864 --> 56:36.285
You know, like,
we stray too far from home and then…

56:39.125 --> 56:40.293
Let the woman breathe.

56:40.377 --> 56:41.379
-Jesus Christ.
-Okay.

56:41.462 --> 56:45.262
So, we're so excited about your movie.
We've been reading about it everywhere.

56:45.345 --> 56:48.059
Oh, wow. Well, please don't tell me
what you've read.

56:48.143 --> 56:51.190
I don't really like reading reviews.
You know, it messes with my head.

56:51.274 --> 56:52.401
Tell me about it, yeah.

56:52.484 --> 56:54.155
-I got a bad one on Yelp once.
-Oh, no.

56:54.238 --> 56:56.200
Still keeps me up at night.

56:56.284 --> 56:58.581
"Left the car smelling
like a Russian bowling league."

56:58.664 --> 57:00.417
What's that even supposed to mean?

57:00.500 --> 57:01.502
I don't know.

57:01.587 --> 57:05.093
Um, but what I do know is that this
is very good, and I would like some more.

57:07.557 --> 57:08.559
No…

57:43.796 --> 57:45.550
-Hey.
-Dad.

57:45.633 --> 57:47.595
Thought I didn't have Marco
until next weekend.

57:47.679 --> 57:50.768
-Yeah, he just forgot his math book again.

57:50.852 --> 57:52.647
-Hi.
-Hi, I'm Marco.

57:52.730 --> 57:55.235
Hi. I'm Olivia. Nice to meet you.

57:55.318 --> 57:58.158
Sorry. I-I-I didn't know you had company.

57:58.241 --> 58:00.580
-Uh, no.
-Just tell Marco I'll be in the car.

58:00.663 --> 58:03.711
-I've seen the trailers.
-Oh, thank you. So nice.

58:03.794 --> 58:04.796
Oh, really?

58:04.880 --> 58:07.301
-Yeah. I'm in the school play.
-Oh, wow. Okay.

58:10.558 --> 58:11.392
You okay?

58:19.868 --> 58:20.870
Hi.

58:31.892 --> 58:34.438
-Was that your ex or something?
-Mmm.

58:35.691 --> 58:36.777
We're separated.

58:38.822 --> 58:42.872
I-I-I have been trying to get her back,
but now that she saw me with you,

58:42.956 --> 58:44.083
I ruined everything.

58:44.584 --> 58:45.836
She will never come back.

58:48.383 --> 58:49.468
You don't know that.

58:50.220 --> 58:51.848
I look like a playboy.

58:51.932 --> 58:53.268
Well, who broke up with who?

58:53.852 --> 58:55.438
She broke up with me.

58:55.523 --> 58:58.486
Yeah, you definitely didn't ruin anything.

59:04.331 --> 59:05.333
Isabel.

59:09.884 --> 59:12.139
She needs me to sign some field-trip form.

59:13.349 --> 59:16.105
I guarantee you
there's no "field-trip form."

59:20.280 --> 59:21.282
Hey.

59:23.453 --> 59:25.791
I mean, I just--
I feel a little blindsided here.

59:25.875 --> 59:28.797
I mean, I told you about Ronnie,
and that's not even that serious.

59:28.881 --> 59:31.218
Uh, don't you need me to sign something?

59:31.302 --> 59:32.220
No.

59:33.056 --> 59:36.270
I mean, I-I-I'm happy for you.
You're moving on.

59:36.354 --> 59:37.732
-No, no, but--
-Which is great.

59:37.815 --> 59:39.986
-It's not what you think.
-I guess I was the one that said

59:40.070 --> 59:43.326
we should be dating other people,
so, you know, I'm glad that you're dating.

59:43.409 --> 59:44.829
No, no, but listen--

59:45.330 --> 59:47.668
Do you love her? No, forget it.

59:48.587 --> 59:50.173
Look, hey, listen.

59:50.256 --> 59:52.344
-Are you going to the Oscars?

59:58.982 --> 1:00:03.449
You know what? I don't need to know.
It's good.

1:00:03.534 --> 1:00:06.455
-Okay.
-Just, um, tell Marco to hurry up, okay?

1:00:06.540 --> 1:00:08.501
Yeah. Yeah, I will.

1:00:10.881 --> 1:00:11.883
Are you okay?

1:00:12.426 --> 1:00:13.428
Great.

1:00:16.308 --> 1:00:18.772
-So we're doing A Midsummer Night's Dream.
-Oh, wow.

1:00:18.856 --> 1:00:22.195
Yeah. I think it'd be awesome
if you wanted to come. I'm Lysander.

1:00:22.279 --> 1:00:24.074
One of the lovers. That's a great role.

1:00:24.158 --> 1:00:27.330
Hijo, she's not going
to a high school play of Shakespeare.

1:00:27.414 --> 1:00:29.544
-Unabridged.
-No one asked you, cerdito.

1:00:29.627 --> 1:00:31.172
Thought she should have
the whole information.

1:00:31.255 --> 1:00:33.927
I mean, it's two and half hours,
not counting intermission.

1:00:34.011 --> 1:00:36.223
-It's Shakespeare. It--
-It's long, is what it is, papi.

1:00:36.307 --> 1:00:37.894
Come on, your mom is waiting for you.
Come on.

1:00:37.977 --> 1:00:39.731
Okay. All right. Bye, everybody.

1:00:39.814 --> 1:00:41.943
And fingers crossed,
we both have big openings this weekend.

1:00:42.027 --> 1:00:44.031
Ay, qué lindo.

1:00:44.114 --> 1:00:45.408
-Bye, guys.
-Bye, mijo.

1:00:45.492 --> 1:00:48.122
-That's my assistant, I should probably--
-You know what that means? Leftover time.

1:00:48.206 --> 1:00:50.753
-I need to make you a care package.
-Please, I've had more than enough.

1:00:56.013 --> 1:00:57.474
-Mmm.
-Oh!

1:00:57.558 --> 1:00:59.436
Heat the Mexican stuff
in the microwave, okay?

1:00:59.521 --> 1:01:01.148
I don't know what to do
with the Korean stuff.

1:01:02.234 --> 1:01:05.616
One, two-- Say "Kimchi!"

1:01:05.699 --> 1:01:07.285
Kimchi!

1:01:07.369 --> 1:01:10.375
Okay. Okay, that's enough.
No, no, no, no. No. Enough.

1:01:10.458 --> 1:01:12.087
No, guys. No more. No more.

1:01:16.888 --> 1:01:19.561
-Come on, guys. Now, let's go inside.
-Thank you. Thank you. Bye. Thank you.

1:01:19.644 --> 1:01:23.276
Sorry again. There's no word
for "boundaries" in Spanish.

1:01:23.359 --> 1:01:24.946
Or Korean, apparently.

1:01:25.029 --> 1:01:27.242
I liked it.
I don't see my family that much.

1:01:28.411 --> 1:01:29.914
-And you were right.
-What?

1:01:30.415 --> 1:01:31.543
Isabel is jealous.

1:01:32.419 --> 1:01:35.091
Maybe we'll both get what we want
out of this insanity.

1:01:36.093 --> 1:01:38.389
Sorry. Waze took me to some batting cage.

1:01:38.472 --> 1:01:39.474
Okay.

1:01:42.272 --> 1:01:43.441
-All right, well…

1:01:44.902 --> 1:01:47.282
…I guess this is, uh, goodbye.

1:01:47.365 --> 1:01:49.787
Thank you.
Thank you so much for helping me out.

1:01:49.871 --> 1:01:53.169
Yeah, I'm looking at 'em right now, ma'am.
They're a couple.

1:01:53.252 --> 1:01:56.926
She really spent the night in the barrio?

1:01:57.010 --> 1:02:00.643
I don't think we use that
word anymore, but yeah, they shacked up.

1:02:00.726 --> 1:02:03.272
I can't believe that bastard
was actually telling the truth.

1:02:03.356 --> 1:02:06.863
Well, it happens sometimes.
Not always, but sometimes.

1:02:06.946 --> 1:02:08.491
- I'll send an invoice.

1:02:18.469 --> 1:02:19.889
Couldn't sleep last night,

1:02:19.972 --> 1:02:22.477
so I poured myself a scotch
and did some soul-searching.

1:02:22.561 --> 1:02:25.567
And I asked myself,
"What kind of man do I wanna be?"

1:02:25.651 --> 1:02:28.907
And I realized
the answer to that question is "rich."

1:02:28.990 --> 1:02:30.744
I want to be a rich and powerful man.

1:02:31.453 --> 1:02:33.667
-I admire your honesty.
-And what was I thinking,

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.798
juggling two women at a premiere
like I'm Leonardo DiCaprio?

1:02:36.881 --> 1:02:39.177
You know, when I was in business school,
I had one dream,

1:02:39.261 --> 1:02:43.018
and that was to become the CEO
of a vast real estate empire.

1:02:43.102 --> 1:02:46.150
Now, why would I risk all that
for what might likely be a passing fancy?

1:02:46.233 --> 1:02:48.822
I mean, sure, Olivia's intoxicating now,

1:02:48.905 --> 1:02:51.243
but who knows
how I'll feel in a few months?

1:02:51.326 --> 1:02:53.205
Besides, I adore my wife.

1:02:53.289 --> 1:02:55.627
I mean, why wouldn't I?
She's the whole package.

1:02:57.172 --> 1:02:58.174
It's Kapoor.

1:03:00.011 --> 1:03:01.472
Hello. Hello, guys?

1:03:01.556 --> 1:03:03.058
Kapoor, what do you got?

1:03:03.142 --> 1:03:05.396
- Stegman is officially out of work.

1:03:05.480 --> 1:03:07.651
Okay, spectacular!

1:03:08.152 --> 1:03:09.446
Kathryn called the dogs off.

1:03:10.699 --> 1:03:13.370
Congratulations. You got away scot-free.

1:03:15.918 --> 1:03:17.713
Out of curiosity, um…

1:03:17.797 --> 1:03:19.550
What was the turning point?

1:03:19.634 --> 1:03:22.305
Well, I hate to tell you, boss,
but she spent the night.

1:03:22.807 --> 1:03:23.850
I see, uh…

1:03:27.357 --> 1:03:28.400
She slept with him.

1:03:30.572 --> 1:03:35.707
Vincent, the important thing is that your
empire and your marriage are still intact.

1:03:35.791 --> 1:03:37.043
No one asked you.

1:03:37.628 --> 1:03:38.839
Kapoor, listen to me.

1:03:38.922 --> 1:03:39.924
Hire another detective.

1:03:40.007 --> 1:03:41.468
I want someone
following her day and night.

1:03:41.553 --> 1:03:43.180
I want someone following him
day and night.

1:03:43.264 --> 1:03:44.767
Full saturation coverage.

1:03:47.773 --> 1:03:51.154
…to relax you further and further.

1:03:52.115 --> 1:03:57.458
Let your shoulders drop. Relax your arms.

1:03:58.587 --> 1:04:01.801
Feel your body begin to relax

1:04:02.636 --> 1:04:06.519
as you envision yourself letting go.

1:04:07.061 --> 1:04:08.272
This is depressing.

1:04:09.482 --> 1:04:11.236
I heard you might be looking for a job.

1:04:12.573 --> 1:04:15.036
-Son of a bitch. You had me bugged.

1:04:15.119 --> 1:04:16.789
Yeah, I'm good at what I do.

1:04:16.873 --> 1:04:18.125
You want a paycheck or what?

1:04:21.465 --> 1:04:22.551
Okay.

1:04:22.635 --> 1:04:24.555
Are you some kind of sex god, Antonio?

1:04:24.639 --> 1:04:26.141
I'm not a sex god.

1:04:26.224 --> 1:04:29.899
When I was a kid, I had a dog
that had a scent or gave off something

1:04:29.982 --> 1:04:31.778
that drove all the girl dogs crazy.

1:04:31.861 --> 1:04:34.617
Maybe…
…maybe you got something like that.

1:05:12.568 --> 1:05:15.239
If things don't work out
with Olivia, give me a call.

1:05:28.641 --> 1:05:31.898
Okay, that's it! You and me in
the bathroom. I got to see it. Right now.

1:05:38.118 --> 1:05:40.206
They love my movie.
Did you read the reviews?

1:05:40.289 --> 1:05:41.793
I thought you never read them.

1:05:41.876 --> 1:05:43.922
Course I read them.
I'm not a crazy person.

1:05:44.005 --> 1:05:48.556
New York - " Earhart Soars."
- "A triumph."

1:05:48.640 --> 1:05:50.977
That's awesome,
but right now I'm with my mom.

1:05:52.230 --> 1:05:53.817
-It's her birthday.
-Oh!

1:05:53.900 --> 1:05:55.111
They love my movie!

1:05:55.194 --> 1:05:57.783
-How great were those reviews?
-I know. I know.

1:05:57.866 --> 1:06:00.580
Oh, except for Elizabeth Pembrooke
of the Chicago Sun-Times.

1:06:00.664 --> 1:06:03.628
I wonder how she'd feel
hearing her sexuality seems forced.

1:06:04.254 --> 1:06:05.757
It was clearly a choice, Liz.

1:06:05.841 --> 1:06:07.135
Let's go drink too much.

1:06:07.218 --> 1:06:10.600
I wish. I'm on my way to Miami.
My sister's getting married.

1:06:10.684 --> 1:06:15.151
Again. But I'm taking you for margaritas
as soon as I get back.

1:06:15.234 --> 1:06:17.238
-Okay, have fun.
- I'm so proud of you.

1:06:17.321 --> 1:06:18.908
-Bye.

1:06:20.954 --> 1:06:23.250
Now, there's this woman.
She owns a bike shop,

1:06:23.333 --> 1:06:26.256
and she's firing up all the natives.

1:06:26.339 --> 1:06:29.262
It's-- I don't understand when
"gentrification" became such a bad word.

1:06:29.345 --> 1:06:33.395
I mean, it's SoulCycle.
It's not the end of the world. It's--

1:06:33.478 --> 1:06:35.734
-I gotta take this. Sorry. Excuse me.
-Okay.

1:06:35.817 --> 1:06:37.905
Yes, hello. How are you?

1:06:37.988 --> 1:06:39.365
I'm at home. Are you nuts?

1:06:39.449 --> 1:06:41.913
My movie's a big hit.
I just got off the phone with my agent.

1:06:41.996 --> 1:06:44.125
There are three more bidders
for the company.

1:06:44.209 --> 1:06:47.423
I mean, it's all happening.
Everything we ever dreamed of.

1:06:48.843 --> 1:06:50.012
Where were you last night?

1:06:51.097 --> 1:06:54.437
-I-- I just-- I wanna see you. I wanna--
-You heard me. Where were you?

1:06:57.193 --> 1:06:58.362
Hey.

1:06:58.445 --> 1:06:59.447
Everything okay?

1:06:59.531 --> 1:07:03.288
Oh, no. Yeah, it's Pico-Union stuff.
It's gonna be the death of me.

1:07:03.873 --> 1:07:05.835
Well, we're gathering for dinner.

1:07:05.919 --> 1:07:08.173
-And I'm gonna be right there. Okay.
-Okay.

1:07:08.257 --> 1:07:09.259
All right.

1:07:15.312 --> 1:07:16.439
I gotta go.

1:07:16.524 --> 1:07:18.110
I'll call you tomorrow, okay?

1:07:19.487 --> 1:07:20.489
Mm-hmm.

1:07:43.536 --> 1:07:44.788
They love my movie.

1:08:10.172 --> 1:08:13.638
Fair love,
you faint with wandering in the wood.

1:08:13.721 --> 1:08:17.562
And to speak troth, I hath forgot our way.

1:08:17.646 --> 1:08:20.902
We'll rest us, Hermia,
if you think it good.

1:08:20.985 --> 1:08:22.906
-And tarry for the comfort of the day.

1:08:22.989 --> 1:08:25.703
Be it so, Lysander,
find you out a bed.

1:08:25.787 --> 1:08:28.125
For I, upon this bank, will rest my head.

1:08:28.626 --> 1:08:31.381
One turf shall serve
as bed for us both.

1:08:31.464 --> 1:08:34.721
One heart, one bed,
two bosoms and one troth.

1:08:34.805 --> 1:08:37.644
Nay, good Lysander.
Do not lie so near.

1:08:38.729 --> 1:08:40.775
Take the sense,
sweet, of my innocence.

1:08:40.859 --> 1:08:42.529
Love takes the meaning
in love's conference.

1:08:42.612 --> 1:08:44.908
-Hi.

1:08:44.992 --> 1:08:47.496
I mean that my heart
unto yours is knit.

1:08:49.000 --> 1:08:51.714
-So that but one heart may become of it.
-Thank you.

1:08:52.591 --> 1:08:55.387
-Two bosoms interchained with an oath.
-I hope it's okay that I came.

1:08:55.471 --> 1:08:58.686
-Marco is gonna be so happy.
-So then two bosoms and a single troth.

1:08:59.270 --> 1:09:00.272
-Hey.

1:09:00.355 --> 1:09:03.278
-By your side no bed room me deny.
-Listen, the other night,

1:09:03.361 --> 1:09:05.407
I don't know if the offer is still good,

1:09:05.491 --> 1:09:10.501
but I am definitely be loving
to meet your assistant.

1:09:10.585 --> 1:09:14.050
You know? And, by the way,
she can call me anytime.

1:09:14.133 --> 1:09:16.137
-She can.
-Oh. Yeah. Okay.

1:09:19.352 --> 1:09:21.231
Lie further off, in human modesty.

1:09:21.899 --> 1:09:24.403
Such separation, as may well be said,

1:09:24.487 --> 1:09:27.409
becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid.

1:09:27.493 --> 1:09:31.167
So far be distant,
and good night, sweet friend.

1:09:31.877 --> 1:09:34.382
Thy love ne'er alter thy sweet life end.

1:09:34.465 --> 1:09:37.179
Amen.
Amen, to that fair prayer, I say.

1:09:37.263 --> 1:09:41.522
Then, end my life when I end loyalty.
Here is my bed.

1:09:42.481 --> 1:09:44.485
-And with half that wish…
-The kid's an overacter.

1:09:44.570 --> 1:09:46.949
-…the wisher's eyes be press'd.
-But the donkey's hilarious.

1:09:48.619 --> 1:09:51.207
I still can't believe
you got up in front of so many people.

1:09:52.669 --> 1:09:56.217
-My son, I'm so proud. I'm so proud.
-Thanks, Dad.

1:09:56.301 --> 1:09:58.514
-You know, it's just theater.
-So proud of you.

1:09:58.598 --> 1:10:01.311
I thought it was good. Long, but good.

1:10:01.394 --> 1:10:02.564
What? It was long.

1:10:02.647 --> 1:10:03.858
Yeah, all right.

1:10:04.651 --> 1:10:07.364
Well, I gotta go give Mom equal time, so…

1:10:07.866 --> 1:10:09.201
All right. Bye, guys.

1:10:09.285 --> 1:10:11.414
¡Ese es mi sobrino!

1:10:11.497 --> 1:10:13.418
-Okay, okay.
-Hey, bravo! Hey, bravo! Bravo!

1:10:13.501 --> 1:10:15.548
-Hey.
-Hey, Mom. Ronnie.

1:10:16.049 --> 1:10:17.510
-I gotta ask…
-Mmm?

1:10:18.386 --> 1:10:21.434
-…what do you see in my brother?
-Oh, the elephant in the room right there.

1:10:21.518 --> 1:10:24.900
That's a tough question.
Um, what do you see in Benny?

1:10:24.983 --> 1:10:26.069
Don't remember.

1:10:29.701 --> 1:10:31.287
Can we just please change the subject?

1:10:31.371 --> 1:10:33.542
-No, no. I wanna answer. Um…

1:10:33.626 --> 1:10:34.878
Well, he's very attractive.

1:10:34.961 --> 1:10:36.882
-Very handsome man.
-Yeah, but I-- Continue, please.

1:10:37.759 --> 1:10:40.932
But what makes your brother special
is that he's decent and kind.

1:10:42.267 --> 1:10:44.355
And he's not pretending
to be someone he's not,

1:10:44.438 --> 1:10:47.277
which is surprisingly hard to find.

1:10:47.361 --> 1:10:49.658
Yeah. We're a dying breed.

1:10:50.910 --> 1:10:54.291
My father would like to thank you
for including us,

1:10:54.375 --> 1:10:57.089
and even though
he didn't understand any of the words,

1:10:57.172 --> 1:10:59.761
he thought
the production design was top-notch.

1:10:59.845 --> 1:11:01.974
-Okay.

1:11:03.561 --> 1:11:07.443
He'd also like to tell Cecilia
she looks especially beautiful tonight.

1:11:07.527 --> 1:11:10.073
Ooh!

1:11:32.827 --> 1:11:34.455
Um…

1:11:34.539 --> 1:11:36.042
She says that he…

1:11:36.585 --> 1:11:40.927
He-- He looks very… handsome too.

1:11:41.010 --> 1:11:43.014
아빠가 너무 잘생겼대.

1:11:44.266 --> 1:11:45.435
¡A bailar!

1:11:45.520 --> 1:11:49.611
Everyone,
get your butts out here! Let's dance!

1:11:51.197 --> 1:11:52.659
Let's go!

1:11:52.742 --> 1:11:55.288
-You're coming. Let's see what you got.
-Oh! Oh, not a lot.

1:11:55.372 --> 1:11:57.417
-Come on. Yes, yes.
-Oh, gosh. It's a lot less than you think.

1:11:57.501 --> 1:11:58.796
Let's do this.

1:11:59.338 --> 1:12:00.340
Wanna dance?

1:12:02.469 --> 1:12:03.471
Hmm.

1:12:08.189 --> 1:12:09.024
¡Amá!

1:12:36.872 --> 1:12:39.501
You know what?
I'm gonna need a tequila too.

1:12:39.586 --> 1:12:42.049
Hey. Natalie.

1:12:42.132 --> 1:12:43.719
-Hey.
-What are you doing here?

1:12:43.802 --> 1:12:46.224
Couple of us were out canvassing today.

1:12:46.307 --> 1:12:48.478
Hey, we're having
another demonstration tomorrow.

1:12:48.562 --> 1:12:50.983
Anything we can do
before the council meeting.

1:12:51.067 --> 1:12:52.277
How is it looking?

1:12:52.361 --> 1:12:55.200
Uh, no good. That's why we're here.
Tequila therapy.

1:12:55.283 --> 1:12:57.120
-I'm sorry.
-Mmm.

1:12:57.204 --> 1:12:58.456
It's okay.

1:12:58.540 --> 1:13:00.252
You know what I'm gonna miss most?

1:13:08.852 --> 1:13:10.856
Oh, I got to go meet my friends.

1:13:27.807 --> 1:13:29.476
Divorced. Three times.

1:13:29.561 --> 1:13:31.898
-Wow.
-The world's most expensive hat trick.

1:13:31.982 --> 1:13:33.067
I'll bet, man.

1:13:34.403 --> 1:13:36.240
Right now,
I'm staying out of my brother's place.

1:13:36.324 --> 1:13:37.660
You got your own room?

1:13:37.744 --> 1:13:42.377
No. He's going through a divorce too.
But his seven-year-old's got a trundle.

1:13:43.171 --> 1:13:45.008
So you sleep
in a seven-year-old's trundle?

1:13:45.968 --> 1:13:47.095
It's not terrible.

1:13:48.348 --> 1:13:49.684
It is for the seven-year-old.

1:14:01.625 --> 1:14:02.627
Okay.

1:14:05.508 --> 1:14:06.510
What about Ronnie?

1:14:06.593 --> 1:14:07.678
Ronnie's an idiot.

1:14:09.808 --> 1:14:11.561
How serious are you and Olivia?

1:14:11.645 --> 1:14:14.483
-Do I stand a chance?
-Yes. Yes, very much.

1:14:16.905 --> 1:14:19.744
Really? I mean,
you would leave a famous actress for me?

1:14:20.621 --> 1:14:23.877
I'm not supposed to tell anyone,
but… we're not really dating.

1:14:24.503 --> 1:14:25.756
Wait. What?

1:14:26.340 --> 1:14:27.593
Yes, it's all pretend.

1:14:27.677 --> 1:14:29.764
Olivia's having an affair
with some billionaire.

1:14:29.848 --> 1:14:31.852
Wait, wait, so you're not a couple?

1:14:32.895 --> 1:14:36.611
No. No, I mean, the whole thing's made up,
so no one finds out.

1:14:36.695 --> 1:14:38.156
You were never a couple?

1:14:38.824 --> 1:14:41.788
No. The guy's lawyer shows up
and offers me money.

1:14:41.872 --> 1:14:44.376
And then,
the guy's wife offers me even more money.

1:14:44.460 --> 1:14:46.005
What-- How much money?

1:14:46.088 --> 1:14:48.342
-$100,000.
-Wait, you got $100,000?

1:14:48.426 --> 1:14:51.182
No, no, no, no.
I already gave my word to the other guy.

1:14:51.265 --> 1:14:52.810
-But.
-But here's the best part.

1:14:52.894 --> 1:14:54.522
-Isabel!
-I was gonna surprise--

1:14:55.356 --> 1:14:56.358
Isabel!

1:14:56.860 --> 1:14:57.862
Shit. That's Ronnie.

1:14:57.945 --> 1:14:59.532
I gotta go. I'll call you later. Okay.

1:14:59.616 --> 1:15:02.037
-Okay. Bye. Bye. Bye.
-Okay. Okay. Okay.

1:15:09.259 --> 1:15:11.013
Venga, cuñado, siéntate.

1:15:15.063 --> 1:15:16.691
Hey, I'm gonna walk Sofia home.

1:15:16.775 --> 1:15:17.860
Mom knows.

1:15:19.697 --> 1:15:21.033
Don't-- Don't be weird.

1:15:28.130 --> 1:15:29.926
Check out the old folks.

1:15:30.009 --> 1:15:32.515
I can't remember the last time
I danced with your sister like that.

1:15:32.598 --> 1:15:34.101
Your cousin's wedding, 2004.

1:15:34.184 --> 1:15:35.771
-Under duress.
-Ay, ya.

1:15:38.359 --> 1:15:39.444
So listen,

1:15:40.321 --> 1:15:43.327
I'm putting in a bid to take over
the parking at Vine Street Grill.

1:15:44.371 --> 1:15:46.543
How many restaurants is that? Four?

1:15:46.626 --> 1:15:47.628
Yeah.

1:15:47.712 --> 1:15:49.632
Mmm. What a big shot.

1:15:49.716 --> 1:15:52.178
Not breaking out
the good scotch just yet.

1:15:52.262 --> 1:15:54.349
Still haggling over some garage fees.

1:15:54.433 --> 1:15:56.103
But if it works out, um…

1:15:57.732 --> 1:15:59.736
I thought you could be
my guy on the ground.

1:16:00.571 --> 1:16:02.407
Create some kind of management position.

1:16:02.992 --> 1:16:04.244
You want to promote me?

1:16:05.163 --> 1:16:08.294
Hey. Sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt.

1:16:08.377 --> 1:16:10.841
I should probably get going.
Do you mind walking me to my car?

1:16:10.924 --> 1:16:13.137
Oh, yeah, yeah. Let's go.

1:16:18.189 --> 1:16:19.483
Okay. All right.

1:16:19.567 --> 1:16:22.740
I'm really getting sick of these guys.

1:16:23.240 --> 1:16:24.661
Wanna mess with these guys?

1:16:25.621 --> 1:16:28.167
Yes. Yes, I really do.

1:16:29.086 --> 1:16:30.213
Come on. Hop on.

1:16:31.382 --> 1:16:33.260
Hey, hey, hey.
Hey, we're up. Hey, we're up!

1:16:33.344 --> 1:16:35.306
-We're up!
-Let's go. Let's go get 'em.

1:16:48.750 --> 1:16:50.713
Stay close. Hey. Stay close.

1:16:50.796 --> 1:16:53.718
Stay close. Wait. Not too close.
Not too close. Not too close.

1:16:53.802 --> 1:16:56.558
-Okay, now. Turn and wave.
-Okay.

1:16:56.641 --> 1:16:58.227
Get closer. Get closer.

1:16:58.310 --> 1:16:59.187
-Hold on!
-Okay.

1:16:59.271 --> 1:17:00.440
Cut it. Cut it.

1:17:02.653 --> 1:17:04.197
Vete a la fregada.

1:17:04.281 --> 1:17:05.450
Here you go. Cut it good.

1:17:05.534 --> 1:17:07.370
Okay, wait.
Go the other way and cut it this way.

1:17:07.454 --> 1:17:09.332
Now cut it-- Now cut it left.

1:17:09.416 --> 1:17:11.838
Here you go. Cut it left.
No, you wanna cut it left.

1:17:11.921 --> 1:17:14.217
When you're backing up,
you wanna cut it the other way.

1:17:14.301 --> 1:17:15.428
What does that mean?

1:17:15.512 --> 1:17:18.852
-Just a fancy way to say, "Screw you."
-¡Vete a la fregada!

1:17:20.438 --> 1:17:21.524
Hey, cut it.

1:17:23.360 --> 1:17:26.785
You know, I've lived in Los Angeles
since I was 16,

1:17:26.868 --> 1:17:28.705
and I've never been here.

1:17:29.749 --> 1:17:30.834
It's beautiful.

1:17:30.918 --> 1:17:32.420
Yeah. Yeah.

1:17:33.339 --> 1:17:36.178
Just don't go
on the other side of the lake.

1:17:36.261 --> 1:17:37.640
That's where the junkies are.

1:17:41.396 --> 1:17:42.398
Cool.

1:17:43.985 --> 1:17:45.404
No one recognizes me here.

1:17:45.989 --> 1:17:47.576
No, pues...

1:17:47.660 --> 1:17:50.666
No one expects to see
a famous actress in MacArthur Park.

1:17:51.709 --> 1:17:52.962
You got the night off.

1:17:54.674 --> 1:17:56.260
It's kind of nice being invisible.

1:17:58.807 --> 1:17:59.725
Huh.

1:18:02.606 --> 1:18:03.608
-Guess what?
-What?

1:18:03.692 --> 1:18:04.986
Isabel wants me back.

1:18:07.616 --> 1:18:09.119
I'm not gonna say I told you so.

1:18:09.870 --> 1:18:10.956
But…

1:18:11.749 --> 1:18:12.751
I told you…

1:18:13.753 --> 1:18:15.214
-so.

1:18:16.216 --> 1:18:17.678
I like this neighborhood.

1:18:17.761 --> 1:18:20.016
-Yeah. It's great, right?
-Mm-hmm.

1:18:21.018 --> 1:18:22.312
But it's gonna change.

1:18:22.980 --> 1:18:25.819
Some developer bought, like, three blocks.

1:18:26.529 --> 1:18:29.284
Pretty soon,
no one's gonna be able to afford the rent.

1:18:29.367 --> 1:18:30.411
Hmm.

1:18:30.996 --> 1:18:33.710
Clara was only nine,
and I had to help out, so…

1:18:34.545 --> 1:18:38.929
You know, I started bussing tables
and working construction.

1:18:39.012 --> 1:18:41.391
-Those guys you see outside Home Depot?
-Yeah.

1:18:41.475 --> 1:18:42.811
That was me.

1:18:43.938 --> 1:18:45.859
Feel like I should've paid for the pizza.

1:18:48.782 --> 1:18:52.539
When-- When I finally got a steady job
as a valet…

1:18:54.459 --> 1:18:56.129
I thought I was doing pretty good.

1:18:56.756 --> 1:18:59.094
And I was saving to help Clara
go to college.

1:19:00.304 --> 1:19:01.766
She's a school principal now.

1:19:03.477 --> 1:19:04.772
She must be so grateful.

1:19:05.649 --> 1:19:08.571
Well, if she is…
…she keeps it to herself.

1:19:10.617 --> 1:19:11.869
Oh, this is you, right?

1:19:12.579 --> 1:19:14.750
Yep, that's me.

1:19:15.376 --> 1:19:16.378
Yeah.

1:19:17.088 --> 1:19:18.090
Um…

1:19:19.719 --> 1:19:20.804
You know, I, um…

1:19:21.889 --> 1:19:23.810
I don't really feel
like being alone tonight.

1:19:23.893 --> 1:19:25.856
Is it okay if I stay at your apartment?

1:19:27.442 --> 1:19:29.530
Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah.

1:19:31.116 --> 1:19:33.328
Thank you. Cool.

1:19:34.122 --> 1:19:35.584
But you get the chair this time.

1:19:35.667 --> 1:19:37.671
Yeah. That's-- That's fair.

1:19:37.755 --> 1:19:38.757
Yeah.

1:19:40.426 --> 1:19:42.806
You know
I'm gonna insist you take the bed.

1:19:42.890 --> 1:19:44.518
I was really counting on it.

1:19:45.687 --> 1:19:47.440
No, seriously. You take the chair.

1:20:02.303 --> 1:20:03.305
¡Amá!

1:20:36.371 --> 1:20:38.626
-Hi, Mrs. Flores.
- Amá.

1:20:43.260 --> 1:20:45.097
The detectives are watching us
from that apartment.

1:20:45.181 --> 1:20:47.143
What? Damn it.

1:20:47.226 --> 1:20:48.980
I'll close them in the bedroom too.

1:20:49.815 --> 1:20:52.320
No. You know what?

1:20:53.113 --> 1:20:54.490
What?

1:20:54.575 --> 1:20:59.417
If Vincent wants to know what's going on…
…in the bedroom,

1:21:00.629 --> 1:21:04.177
we're gonna show him
what's going on in the bedroom.

1:21:06.056 --> 1:21:07.475
What's going on in the bedroom?

1:21:09.521 --> 1:21:13.613
Okay, what I don't understand is
who put the spell on Lysander.

1:21:13.696 --> 1:21:15.491
Puck did. But it doesn't matter.

1:21:15.575 --> 1:21:19.374
I think what Shakespeare's trying to say
is we can't help ourselves.

1:21:19.457 --> 1:21:22.839
We fall in love with the wrong people.

1:21:22.923 --> 1:21:24.092
-Oh, boy.
-What?

1:21:24.175 --> 1:21:26.806
-Client ain't gonna like this.
-Put it on.

1:21:27.390 --> 1:21:28.601
-Oh, wow.
-Okay.

1:21:28.685 --> 1:21:29.687
Here we go.

1:21:30.772 --> 1:21:32.567
-Perfect.
-Wow.

1:21:32.651 --> 1:21:33.485
Oh, wow.

1:21:33.569 --> 1:21:38.036
I would say that's--
that's evidence right there, isn't it?

1:21:39.330 --> 1:21:41.459
-Okay. You okay? Okay.
-Yeah.

1:21:41.544 --> 1:21:44.424
That's my shoe. It's okay.
Now I'm gonna push you. Okay.

1:21:44.925 --> 1:21:49.350
Okay. All right.
Now I'm gonna sensually climb you.

1:21:50.436 --> 1:21:51.438
Wow.

1:21:51.522 --> 1:21:54.402
She is wild.

1:21:54.485 --> 1:21:57.701
And now we writhe. And now we writhe.
And now--

1:21:57.784 --> 1:21:59.621
Oh, yeah, we're gonna get in the hair now.

1:21:59.705 --> 1:22:03.420
Gonna get in the hair. Oh, we're surfing.
We're surfing some waves.

1:22:03.503 --> 1:22:07.888
-There's some waves of ecstasy. Oh, yeah.
-I'm starting to feel uncomfortable.

1:22:07.971 --> 1:22:09.057
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

1:22:09.140 --> 1:22:10.769
Okay. I don't really need you anymore.

1:22:10.852 --> 1:22:13.566
You can just-- You can just slip out.
You're under the frame.

1:22:13.649 --> 1:22:15.528
-I can leave?
-Yeah, just stay under the windowsill.

1:22:15.612 --> 1:22:17.699
-Just slither down.
-Okay.

1:22:17.783 --> 1:22:19.327
Just stay under the windowsill.

1:22:19.410 --> 1:22:22.793
Oh, no. The one-woman show. Ooh, kinky.

1:22:22.876 --> 1:22:24.797
What a lucky guy.

1:22:24.880 --> 1:22:26.926
God, she's doing all the work.

1:22:27.009 --> 1:22:29.515
Antonio! Oh, Antonio!

1:22:29.598 --> 1:22:30.642
What?

1:22:30.725 --> 1:22:32.144
I'm acting.

1:22:33.438 --> 1:22:36.319
Okay. Okay.
I'm a gazelle. I'm a little gazelle.

1:22:36.904 --> 1:22:38.741
What does this guy have that I don't have?

1:22:39.450 --> 1:22:40.452
Her.

1:22:47.592 --> 1:22:48.886
You're the man!

1:22:48.928 --> 1:22:50.430
Oh, yes, yes!

1:22:57.027 --> 1:22:59.783
That is how you have sex with someone!

1:23:11.515 --> 1:23:13.769
-You know what to do.

1:23:13.853 --> 1:23:15.857
- ¡Amá!
-Oh, Antonio!

1:23:15.940 --> 1:23:18.529
Oh, yeah, this is the best by far!

1:23:23.789 --> 1:23:26.795
That's it! That's it! Ay, papi!

1:23:29.593 --> 1:23:32.557
I still don't really
understand why are you two doing all this.

1:23:34.101 --> 1:23:35.522
A lot of reasons.

1:23:37.776 --> 1:23:40.531
I can't think of them right now, but…

1:23:43.370 --> 1:23:44.957
there were some.

1:23:49.340 --> 1:23:50.467
Are you okay?

1:23:53.558 --> 1:23:56.312
I don't want you to think,
you know, I'm some…

1:23:57.481 --> 1:23:59.695
ungrateful, poor little movie star.

1:24:02.993 --> 1:24:04.245
I don't think that.

1:24:08.587 --> 1:24:11.760
I have one of the most recognizable faces
in the world.

1:24:14.307 --> 1:24:15.727
I don't ever really feel…

1:24:17.438 --> 1:24:18.524
seen.

1:24:21.655 --> 1:24:24.201
I've convinced myself
I have this perfect life

1:24:24.285 --> 1:24:25.580
that everyone thinks I have,

1:24:25.663 --> 1:24:29.963
but I have never had
a healthy long-term relationship.

1:24:32.969 --> 1:24:34.806
All my friends are people I pay.

1:24:35.390 --> 1:24:37.729
I don't see my family ever.

1:24:41.361 --> 1:24:43.365
I had Thanksgiving with my assistant.

1:24:48.333 --> 1:24:50.420
And Vince is never gonna leave his wife.

1:24:52.592 --> 1:24:54.888
He would be crazy not to.

1:24:59.606 --> 1:25:00.608
You're a good guy.

1:25:01.442 --> 1:25:03.656
Why can't I fall in love
with someone like you?

1:25:05.117 --> 1:25:06.119
I'm taken.

1:25:06.202 --> 1:25:07.914
Yeah, that's my type.

1:25:12.381 --> 1:25:13.718
Hey, where are you going? Stay.

1:25:17.182 --> 1:25:18.476
-Sure?
-Yeah.

1:25:19.855 --> 1:25:20.857
Okay.

1:25:21.357 --> 1:25:22.401
Here.

1:25:32.129 --> 1:25:33.883
You wanna hear something funny?

1:25:36.095 --> 1:25:37.891
-Yeah.
-It's really embarrassing.

1:25:41.147 --> 1:25:43.819
My real name isn't Olivia Allan.

1:25:46.992 --> 1:25:48.495
It's Betsy Shevchuk.

1:25:52.044 --> 1:25:54.423
That's a terrible name.

1:25:55.425 --> 1:25:56.762
It's good you changed it.

1:26:03.526 --> 1:26:04.945
I just made us 300 bucks.

1:26:05.613 --> 1:26:06.865
Tipped off the paparazzi.

1:26:06.949 --> 1:26:10.038
Ethically questionable,
but tonight we're gonna eat like kings.

1:26:10.121 --> 1:26:12.459
Dude, I was gone for 20 minutes. I…

1:26:29.995 --> 1:26:31.205
Where are you going?

1:26:32.374 --> 1:26:34.588
I'm meeting Isabel. Go back to sleep.

1:26:35.923 --> 1:26:37.384
There's coffee above the fridge.

1:26:52.540 --> 1:26:53.751
Couldn't sleep last night.

1:26:54.878 --> 1:26:56.172
Me either.

1:26:56.255 --> 1:26:58.719
I was, you know, thinking and thinking.

1:26:59.930 --> 1:27:00.931
Uh…

1:27:03.896 --> 1:27:06.150
Look, this isn't easy for me, but, um…

1:27:09.073 --> 1:27:10.241
I thought about it.

1:27:11.954 --> 1:27:13.958
And I thought about it, and…

1:27:16.087 --> 1:27:18.257
this is never gonna be what I need.

1:27:22.140 --> 1:27:23.142
What are you saying?

1:27:24.562 --> 1:27:26.399
We met when we were really young.

1:27:28.319 --> 1:27:29.739
We're different people now.

1:27:31.827 --> 1:27:33.914
I think it's time we got the divorce.

1:27:37.880 --> 1:27:39.968
-But you kissed me last night.
-I know.

1:27:40.761 --> 1:27:43.726
But then I couldn't stop thinking about
all the money that you turned down.

1:27:45.353 --> 1:27:49.319
Antonio, you walk through life
like you don't deserve much.

1:27:50.238 --> 1:27:52.075
How do you think that makes me feel?

1:27:54.079 --> 1:27:57.670
I wanna be with someone who feels like
they deserve the best of everything.

1:27:59.924 --> 1:28:01.010
I'm sorry.

1:28:05.018 --> 1:28:06.563
Yeah. A work of art.

1:28:07.732 --> 1:28:10.529
It's a work of art. Truly. Bravo.

1:28:11.280 --> 1:28:12.449
It's excellent work.

1:28:12.533 --> 1:28:14.621
And it is just what Pico-Union needs.

1:28:15.790 --> 1:28:17.209
Incredible. Thank you.

1:28:17.292 --> 1:28:18.754
-Ooh, uh…

1:28:18.837 --> 1:28:19.839
Excuse me.

1:28:24.974 --> 1:28:26.143
Is that Kapoor?

1:28:27.772 --> 1:28:30.861
-It's nothing you need to worry about.
-Please don't treat me like a child.

1:28:33.407 --> 1:28:35.078
God, she's doing all the work.

1:28:35.579 --> 1:28:36.623
I see.

1:28:37.499 --> 1:28:38.585
Good to know.

1:28:38.669 --> 1:28:39.796
This is a woman.

1:28:46.225 --> 1:28:48.312
I think I'm more attractive in Spanish.

1:28:49.481 --> 1:28:51.193
Hey, how'd it go?

1:28:51.778 --> 1:28:52.864
Not great.

1:29:03.301 --> 1:29:04.428
What happened?

1:29:05.388 --> 1:29:06.641
Isabel wants a divorce.

1:29:09.104 --> 1:29:10.983
Wha-- Why?

1:29:12.152 --> 1:29:14.239
She was only interested
because I was with you.

1:29:15.366 --> 1:29:18.957
When she found out I wasn't,
it was, "Adios, Antonio."

1:29:21.671 --> 1:29:23.007
Um, I'm sorry.

1:29:24.176 --> 1:29:26.096
Yeah. Me too.

1:29:26.765 --> 1:29:28.434
Did she give you any other reason?

1:29:29.269 --> 1:29:31.023
She doesn't want to be with a valet.

1:29:32.526 --> 1:29:34.948
She has bigger plans than me.

1:29:35.031 --> 1:29:36.075
Wha-- She said that?

1:29:36.158 --> 1:29:38.664
She's been saying that
for years in a certain way.

1:29:40.918 --> 1:29:42.588
Well, maybe she doesn't deserve you.

1:29:44.007 --> 1:29:46.345
I take ketchup packets from restaurants.

1:29:46.387 --> 1:29:47.848
Yeah, I'm a real catch.

1:29:48.725 --> 1:29:52.900
-I have a drawer full of soy sauce.
-I don't wanna talk about her, okay?

1:29:52.984 --> 1:29:55.739
-Why don't you wanna talk? Let's talk.
-Because I don't, okay?

1:29:55.823 --> 1:29:56.866
But you're a wonderful man.

1:29:56.950 --> 1:29:58.870
You should be with someone
who appreciates you.

1:29:59.454 --> 1:30:01.291
How can you say that with a straight face?

1:30:01.375 --> 1:30:03.714
-What's that supposed to mean?
-Nothing.

1:30:03.797 --> 1:30:06.135
No, come on.
You put it out there. What does that mean?

1:30:07.470 --> 1:30:11.646
You can have any man in the world,
and you pick one that is married. Great.

1:30:13.315 --> 1:30:15.821
That's not fair. I didn't know
he was married when I met him.

1:30:15.904 --> 1:30:19.327
Did you ever think that maybe--
maybe you don't want a relationship?

1:30:19.411 --> 1:30:21.958
Maybe you don't want anyone
to really know you.

1:30:22.877 --> 1:30:26.133
-Okay, that's ridiculous.
-You don't even talk to your own mother.

1:30:26.216 --> 1:30:29.347
I share a bathroom with mine.
And she's not shy.

1:30:29.891 --> 1:30:30.893
Bye, Ma.

1:30:30.976 --> 1:30:32.772
How did this become about me?
This was about you--

1:30:32.855 --> 1:30:34.399
You don't know anything about me.

1:30:34.483 --> 1:30:36.571
What are you talking about?
I'm your friend.

1:30:36.654 --> 1:30:38.115
Oh, really? We're friends?

1:30:38.199 --> 1:30:40.078
-Of course.
-Come on.

1:30:40.161 --> 1:30:41.998
You're gonna go back
to your movie-star life,

1:30:42.082 --> 1:30:44.211
and I'm gonna go back
to being invisible to you.

1:30:44.294 --> 1:30:46.131
That-- That's not true.

1:30:46.215 --> 1:30:50.098
And by the way,
being invisible is not fun.

1:30:50.181 --> 1:30:53.939
Do you have any idea what it's like
to have people hand you their keys

1:30:54.022 --> 1:30:55.776
and not even look you in the eye?

1:30:56.653 --> 1:30:57.655
I'm not like that.

1:30:57.738 --> 1:31:00.159
Oh! So you're gonna call me,
and we're gonna have lunch?

1:31:01.663 --> 1:31:04.501
I don't know. Maybe.
I don't really do that with anyone.

1:31:04.585 --> 1:31:06.130
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

1:31:06.213 --> 1:31:08.844
You took what you needed from me,
and now you can leave.

1:31:10.430 --> 1:31:13.352
-Olivia, Olivia! Smile!
-Look. Your real friends.

1:31:13.435 --> 1:31:15.231
Last chance to take pictures, guys.

1:31:15.314 --> 1:31:19.532
The actress and the valet,
we're breaking up. It's over.

1:31:19.615 --> 1:31:21.118
-Antonio.
-What?

1:31:23.540 --> 1:31:24.625
Forget it.

1:31:32.265 --> 1:31:33.685
Did you just end it with Antonio?

1:31:33.768 --> 1:31:35.898
-Quick chat!
-Are you and Antonio over?

1:31:35.981 --> 1:31:37.526
Is Antonio with somebody else?

1:31:46.961 --> 1:31:48.047
Perfecto.

1:31:51.136 --> 1:31:53.224
Vincent.
Vincent, stay calm. Vincent.

1:31:54.644 --> 1:31:55.646
Vincent! Vincent!

1:31:57.900 --> 1:31:59.319
Ow!

1:31:59.402 --> 1:32:01.741
I didn't hire you
to sleep with my girlfriend!

1:32:01.824 --> 1:32:04.246
That hurt!
Way more than I thought it would.

1:32:04.329 --> 1:32:05.582
Let's go.

1:32:05.666 --> 1:32:07.001
I'm not paying you a cent.

1:32:08.003 --> 1:32:09.297
Get-- All right, all right.

1:33:10.169 --> 1:33:12.006
So, you never had sex with her?

1:33:12.090 --> 1:33:12.966
Nah.

1:33:16.557 --> 1:33:17.851
I hate seeing you hurt.

1:33:18.520 --> 1:33:20.356
-But the world makes sense again.

1:33:22.193 --> 1:33:23.613
-Mr. Flores?
-Paso.

1:33:24.406 --> 1:33:25.408
Oh.

1:33:25.491 --> 1:33:27.161
-Yes?
-Do you have a minute?

1:33:31.503 --> 1:33:34.510
My employer can be a little volatile.

1:33:35.762 --> 1:33:37.599
But you kept your side of the bargain.

1:33:42.316 --> 1:33:44.070
$25,000?

1:33:45.866 --> 1:33:48.538
But that-- that's much more
than we agreed to.

1:33:48.621 --> 1:33:49.665
He won't notice.

1:33:50.876 --> 1:33:52.713
No, no, no. I can't accept this.

1:34:00.019 --> 1:34:02.023
You know, I grew up not too far from you.

1:34:04.068 --> 1:34:07.200
My father was the locker-room attendant
at the California Club.

1:34:40.892 --> 1:34:43.230
In my job,
I don't get too many opportunities

1:34:43.313 --> 1:34:44.567
to do the right thing.

1:34:45.860 --> 1:34:47.363
Hey, look at these two.

1:34:47.948 --> 1:34:52.624
They just had sex,
and now he's making her eggs.

1:34:53.585 --> 1:34:57.425
I swear to God,
I never had a relationship that good.

1:34:59.638 --> 1:35:00.724
Stegman, listen, um…

1:35:01.559 --> 1:35:03.353
you know, I've got this extra room.

1:35:03.437 --> 1:35:06.318
Two-bedroom place. It's on the jetty.

1:35:06.401 --> 1:35:09.115
And, you know, we could get you off
your SpongeBob trundle.

1:35:09.198 --> 1:35:10.619
If that's something…

1:35:10.702 --> 1:35:11.704
That an offer?

1:35:11.787 --> 1:35:13.875
No, I'm just-- You know, I could use
the company, you know?

1:35:13.958 --> 1:35:16.171
-And there's paddle tennis courts.
-Oh, yeah.

1:35:16.254 --> 1:35:18.843
-I don't know what that is, but--
-Yeah, we could get in shape.

1:35:18.927 --> 1:35:20.346
Yeah, hold each other accountable.

1:35:20.429 --> 1:35:23.393
We could-- Yeah. If you know, if you--

1:35:23.477 --> 1:35:26.316
-Not that I don't-- But if you wanna--
-Dude. Yeah.

1:35:26.399 --> 1:35:28.362
-Yeah?
-Come on, yeah.

1:35:30.867 --> 1:35:32.286
Roomies. All right.

1:35:35.627 --> 1:35:36.629
Oh, shit.

1:35:38.423 --> 1:35:40.469
아, 이게 웬일이야! 이게 웬일이야

1:35:40.553 --> 1:35:43.392
여기 누가 좀 도와줘, 여기 좀 도와줘
누가 여기 좀 빨리 도와줘.

1:37:21.630 --> 1:37:22.966
I'm going to speak in English

1:37:23.049 --> 1:37:25.513
because I want Mr. Kim
to understand everything.

1:37:25.597 --> 1:37:28.603
미스터 김이
다 알아들을 수 있도록 영어로 말해드릴게요.

1:37:33.195 --> 1:37:36.451
Cecilia Imelda Lopez, viuda de Flores,

1:37:37.954 --> 1:37:40.417
was born in El Remolino, Zacatecas.

1:37:41.002 --> 1:37:44.801
A village so small,
it didn't appear on any maps.

1:37:46.137 --> 1:37:47.306
Mama was tough.

1:37:48.433 --> 1:37:49.603
She had to be.

1:37:50.980 --> 1:37:53.861
When she was young, she lost her parents,

1:37:53.945 --> 1:37:57.535
two uncles and a cousin,
all in one terrible day.

1:37:59.665 --> 1:38:05.092
If you grow up poor in my country,
you have to face a lot of hard times.

1:38:06.094 --> 1:38:07.304
A lot of violence.

1:38:07.388 --> 1:38:10.435
However, she always stayed positive.

1:38:10.520 --> 1:38:13.859
She had to start working in the fields
to support herself.

1:38:14.443 --> 1:38:15.905
That's how she met my dad.

1:38:16.532 --> 1:38:18.536
They had me by the time she was 18.

1:38:19.120 --> 1:38:20.915
She had to work the entire pregnancy.

1:38:20.999 --> 1:38:22.001
Literally.

1:38:22.669 --> 1:38:24.756
I was born under an avocado tree.

1:38:25.550 --> 1:38:28.597
But she was happy
because she got paid for the full day.

1:38:31.645 --> 1:38:35.862
Several years later,
right before my sister was born,

1:38:35.945 --> 1:38:39.452
my dad tried to break up a fight
between some workers…

1:38:41.372 --> 1:38:43.209
and he died from a knife wound.

1:38:46.090 --> 1:38:47.886
Mama had to start all over again.

1:38:48.888 --> 1:38:52.520
Mama saved every penny she could
to send Clara and me to the States.

1:38:53.981 --> 1:38:58.031
I found out later, she never ate lunch
at work to save that money.

1:38:59.618 --> 1:39:04.085
When we could, we brought her here,
and that's how she met Mr. Kim.

1:39:04.168 --> 1:39:06.507
그래, 결국 미국으로 왔어요.

1:39:07.299 --> 1:39:09.136
She knew you hated her pozole,

1:39:10.055 --> 1:39:13.896
but it meant so much to her
that you lied about it.

1:39:13.979 --> 1:39:15.566
너무 맛있게 잘 먹었어요

1:39:17.069 --> 1:39:21.452
I don't know much about you
or what brought you to this country,

1:39:22.539 --> 1:39:24.876
but my mother sent us here
to have a better life.

1:39:26.839 --> 1:39:29.468
Maybe it was so she could meet you
one day as well.

1:39:29.553 --> 1:39:33.602
그렇게 만나러 온 지도 몰라요.

1:39:34.604 --> 1:39:37.735
Hyun-Woo, thank you.

1:39:37.819 --> 1:39:39.990
Thank you
for bringing her so much happiness.

1:39:40.658 --> 1:39:42.662
행복하게 만들어줘서 너무 고마워요.

1:39:46.294 --> 1:39:48.549
My mother didn't live the kind of life

1:39:48.632 --> 1:39:51.680
that was going to get her picture
in a magazine.

1:39:53.767 --> 1:39:54.769
But she lived…

1:39:56.272 --> 1:39:58.109
She lived an extraordinary life.

1:40:02.367 --> 1:40:03.871
She was a force of nature.

1:40:04.998 --> 1:40:08.839
When-- When she loved, she loved fully.

1:40:10.050 --> 1:40:14.433
When she hugged,
she squeezed the life out of you.

1:40:18.107 --> 1:40:21.782
When she laughed, the ground shook.

1:40:36.520 --> 1:40:37.689
Goodbye, Mama.

1:41:02.905 --> 1:41:04.033
There he is.

1:41:05.745 --> 1:41:07.372
-You spying on me?

1:41:07.456 --> 1:41:10.253
No, we're partners.
But I do want receipts.

1:43:06.443 --> 1:43:07.822
Okay, okay, okay!

1:43:19.177 --> 1:43:21.850
Here you go, buddy. Pull up
and the valets will park it for you.

1:43:21.933 --> 1:43:22.935
Okay. Thank you.

1:43:26.066 --> 1:43:27.402
It's okay, guys. I got this.

1:43:55.333 --> 1:43:57.253
No, that's absolutely not true, no.

1:43:57.337 --> 1:44:00.343
Well, no, I'm just doing
what should have been done.

1:44:00.426 --> 1:44:02.180
-No. I don't know--
-Cut!

1:44:02.263 --> 1:44:04.309
We got it. Let's move on.

1:44:04.393 --> 1:44:06.773
-Great! Okay guys, come on.

1:44:06.856 --> 1:44:08.442
Ms. Allan, can I get you anything?

1:44:08.527 --> 1:44:10.405
-Yeah, I would love a coffee.
-Okay.

1:44:13.160 --> 1:44:15.164
If that's not too much, thank you.

1:44:16.125 --> 1:44:17.460
Sorry, one sec.

1:44:22.638 --> 1:44:23.682
Good luck.

1:44:33.242 --> 1:44:35.539
Amanda just told me about your mom.

1:44:38.461 --> 1:44:39.630
I'm so sorry.

1:44:43.972 --> 1:44:45.016
Can we talk?

1:44:55.579 --> 1:44:57.040
Uh, so, you gonna talk, or…

1:44:57.123 --> 1:44:58.627
-Yeah, yeah.
-Okay.

1:44:58.710 --> 1:45:03.595
Look, I'm probably the last person
you need advice from,

1:45:03.678 --> 1:45:08.062
but I just couldn't watch you
wait your turn with that cabrón.

1:45:09.147 --> 1:45:11.235
He will never see you
for who you really are.

1:45:12.905 --> 1:45:15.619
Well, did you just come here
to insult me more?

1:45:15.702 --> 1:45:19.042
-No, no, no, no. No. No, I--
-I'm kidding. I'm kidding.

1:45:21.004 --> 1:45:22.842
I'm going to break up with him.

1:45:24.720 --> 1:45:26.014
-Yeah.
-Really?

1:45:26.098 --> 1:45:29.897
Yeah. It's been far, far too long.

1:45:30.607 --> 1:45:32.485
I'm finally ready.

1:45:33.320 --> 1:45:35.491
You probably deserve
a little credit for that.

1:45:37.997 --> 1:45:39.750
I should not have said those things.

1:45:40.794 --> 1:45:43.215
I didn't mean it. I'm really sorry.

1:45:46.388 --> 1:45:47.641
Well, they were true.

1:45:49.019 --> 1:45:50.689
Yeah, they were. That's why it hurt.

1:45:52.400 --> 1:45:53.904
I'm-- I'm sorry too.

1:45:55.364 --> 1:45:56.784
-Sorry.

1:45:58.872 --> 1:46:01.209
No. Vincent.

1:46:02.796 --> 1:46:03.798
You know, I just--

1:46:03.882 --> 1:46:05.928
-I wanna be in the right frame of mind…
-Yeah.

1:46:06.011 --> 1:46:07.138
-…when I tell him.
-Of course.

1:46:07.221 --> 1:46:08.558
You're a strong woman.

1:46:09.267 --> 1:46:11.940
-You can do it, güera. You can do it.

1:46:12.023 --> 1:46:14.654
I've tried breaking up with him before,

1:46:14.737 --> 1:46:18.536
-and he always talks me out of it.
-Ms. Allan.

1:46:18.620 --> 1:46:20.289
-We're ready for you.
-Okay.

1:46:20.958 --> 1:46:22.878
-I gotta go.
-Yeah, yeah.

1:46:22.962 --> 1:46:24.507
-Okay.
-Go, go. Go ahead.

1:46:24.590 --> 1:46:26.552
-Güera.

1:46:27.763 --> 1:46:29.809
If you get weak, just call me, okay?

1:46:30.644 --> 1:46:32.397
I'll remind you what an asshole he is.

1:46:42.710 --> 1:46:45.047
Hi.
Why aren't you at the office?

1:46:45.841 --> 1:46:47.010
Just playing a little hooky.

1:46:47.093 --> 1:46:48.805
Why don't you go
get your suit on and join me?

1:46:48.888 --> 1:46:49.890
All right.

1:46:51.059 --> 1:46:54.024
Your daiquiri's at low tide.
I'll be right back.

1:47:47.255 --> 1:47:48.257
Hi, Vince.

1:48:07.253 --> 1:48:08.798
God, I've missed that hoodie.

1:48:18.735 --> 1:48:20.614
-Hey.
-Hi, Vincent.

1:48:20.697 --> 1:48:22.158
It's me. The valet.

1:48:23.243 --> 1:48:24.245
What is going on here?

1:48:24.830 --> 1:48:26.249
I'm serving you divorce papers.

1:48:26.333 --> 1:48:27.878
No, no, no. I'm calling security.

1:48:27.961 --> 1:48:29.798
No, no, wait, wait, wait. Pérate.

1:48:30.299 --> 1:48:33.472
Before you do that,
someone wants to talk with you.

1:48:38.983 --> 1:48:40.361
-Hello?
-Hi, honey.

1:48:40.444 --> 1:48:43.450
Listen, I'm downstairs.
Listening to everything.

1:48:43.534 --> 1:48:44.954
Okay. Okay.

1:48:45.037 --> 1:48:50.464
Well then, Kathryn, listen to me
when I tell you that love conquers all,

1:48:50.549 --> 1:48:51.968
and it always will.

1:48:52.051 --> 1:48:53.638
And we will work through this.

1:48:53.721 --> 1:48:54.890
Oh, please.

1:48:54.974 --> 1:48:56.519
Also, I'm taking the company.

1:48:56.602 --> 1:49:01.111
Okay.
You can't take the company.

1:49:01.194 --> 1:49:03.533
Uh, I built this empire
from the ground up.

1:49:03.616 --> 1:49:07.373
No, my father built it.
You just slapped your name on everything.

1:49:07.456 --> 1:49:10.254
Oh, and you're probably gonna
wanna go ahead and call your lawyer

1:49:10.337 --> 1:49:12.008
because I did a little digging,

1:49:12.091 --> 1:49:15.598
and I discovered some of
your very clever offshore holdings.

1:49:15.682 --> 1:49:17.143
As a member of the board,

1:49:17.226 --> 1:49:20.316
I had a fiduciary responsibility
to inform the authorities.

1:49:20.399 --> 1:49:22.946
I hope that doesn't inconvenience you.

1:49:23.030 --> 1:49:26.662
Okay, Kathryn, um,
you've got this all wrong.

1:49:26.746 --> 1:49:29.125
Olivia, she means nothing to me.

1:49:29.208 --> 1:49:32.131
She's just some insecure,
vain actress that I wish--

1:49:32.214 --> 1:49:34.135
that I wish that I had never met.

1:49:34.218 --> 1:49:35.847
Yeah, you're on speaker, Vincent.

1:49:36.640 --> 1:49:38.686
Olivia, my love. Hello.

1:49:38.770 --> 1:49:41.066
Well, I finally did it. I finally did it.

1:49:41.149 --> 1:49:43.153
We are-- We are free.

1:49:43.236 --> 1:49:46.076
And we can be together forever now.
No strings attached.

1:49:46.159 --> 1:49:50.752
Love always finds its way, and we will
work through this. Just you and me.

1:49:57.139 --> 1:49:58.768
That felt good!

1:49:58.851 --> 1:50:00.187
What-- Are you speaking Spanish now?

1:50:00.270 --> 1:50:01.690
What? He brainwash you?

1:50:02.274 --> 1:50:03.318
Hey!

1:50:03.820 --> 1:50:05.406
Adiós, Vicente.

1:50:06.074 --> 1:50:07.076
What?

1:50:11.585 --> 1:50:13.088
Shit!

1:50:13.171 --> 1:50:17.096
I can't say how sorry I am
for getting involved with…

1:50:18.432 --> 1:50:19.434
him.

1:50:21.312 --> 1:50:22.314
I feel terrible.

1:50:22.398 --> 1:50:28.828
Listen, Vincent was still married
to his first wife when I met him,

1:50:28.911 --> 1:50:31.625
so I knew what I was getting.

1:50:33.462 --> 1:50:36.844
Mr. Flores, thank you for everything.

1:50:36.927 --> 1:50:40.267
Is there anything I can do for you
to show you my gratitude?

1:50:43.356 --> 1:50:47.364
Well, actually, there is.

1:50:48.200 --> 1:50:50.580
First it's a bike shop,
then a little bakery.

1:50:50.663 --> 1:50:52.249
Next thing you know,

1:50:52.333 --> 1:50:56.216
gentrification has erased
the heart and soul of our neighborhood!

1:50:56.299 --> 1:50:57.802
-Yeah.
-Yes!

1:50:57.886 --> 1:51:00.015
A friend of mine said recently,

1:51:00.098 --> 1:51:02.186
-"You want bikes that don't go anywhere?"
-Excuse me.

1:51:02.269 --> 1:51:06.277
I've just received notification
the developers have changed their mind.

1:51:08.198 --> 1:51:10.870
They've decided to call off the project.
It's not moving forward.

1:51:10.954 --> 1:51:11.997
-What?

1:51:14.252 --> 1:51:16.005
-Honey, we--

1:51:17.258 --> 1:51:18.928
We did it! Yeah!

1:51:19.011 --> 1:51:21.266
Kids. Come on.

1:51:21.892 --> 1:51:23.019
Ready? Come on.

1:51:32.664 --> 1:51:33.666
Junior Mint?

1:51:52.912 --> 1:51:54.081
Do you guys hate me?

1:52:00.762 --> 1:52:03.350
Now coming to you live from the scene

1:52:03.433 --> 1:52:08.151
where FBI agents have just taken
Vincent Royce into custody

1:52:08.234 --> 1:52:10.990
for allegations of embezzlement.

1:52:11.074 --> 1:52:16.167
Police officials have yet to give
a statement at this time, but we will…

1:52:16.669 --> 1:52:18.756
Okay, you're over-fluffing that.

1:52:19.423 --> 1:52:20.551
Do you not want them fluffy now?

1:52:20.635 --> 1:52:22.847
You said fluffy,
so why don't you just make up your mind?

1:52:22.931 --> 1:52:24.685
-It's just too much. That's all.
-No, it's just--

1:52:24.768 --> 1:52:26.980
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-No, it's just-- You're just--

1:52:27.064 --> 1:52:29.695
-Why are you so tense?
-I'm sorry. I just want to have breakfast.

1:52:29.778 --> 1:52:31.824
-Why you so tense?
-Let's just-- I'm-- Stop, stop!

1:52:37.459 --> 1:52:38.963
I need a bicycle for this wheel.

1:52:39.589 --> 1:52:40.591
Hmm.

1:52:41.510 --> 1:52:42.846
Something like that?

1:52:48.356 --> 1:52:51.655
I bought it off a junkie in the park.
I figured you'd be back eventually.

1:52:51.739 --> 1:52:53.491
-How?

1:52:53.576 --> 1:52:54.995
That's amazing.

1:52:56.707 --> 1:52:57.959
How much do I owe you?

1:52:59.128 --> 1:53:00.798
-Eight bucks.
-Eight bucks?

1:53:00.882 --> 1:53:02.176
Yeah, he was an awful negotiator.

1:53:03.929 --> 1:53:06.476
Oh, hey. Did you hear? We get to stay.

1:53:07.060 --> 1:53:08.689
Yeah. Everybody does.

1:53:08.773 --> 1:53:11.695
Yeah. I was really happy about that.

1:53:11.779 --> 1:53:14.158
Yeah, no one knows
why they changed their minds.

1:53:16.245 --> 1:53:19.418
Well, sometimes the good guys just win.

1:53:22.424 --> 1:53:25.515
Uh, if you just give me a couple of hours,
I will have it up and running.

1:53:25.598 --> 1:53:27.727
-Okay. Good.

1:53:27.811 --> 1:53:29.063
-Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

1:53:46.849 --> 1:53:51.357
And then I thought,
"Come on. Go back and ask her out."

1:53:55.950 --> 1:53:59.206
-So what happened? Did you go out?
-I-I-It was a little weird.

1:53:59.290 --> 1:54:00.877
-Oh, why?

1:54:00.960 --> 1:54:03.716
I haven't been on a date,
like, in forever.

1:54:03.799 --> 1:54:05.553
-Right.
-But it was just dinner.

1:54:05.636 --> 1:54:07.347
I mean,
it's not like we're getting married.

1:54:07.431 --> 1:54:09.811
But then she invited me
to see a band on Saturday,

1:54:09.895 --> 1:54:12.149
so I think it went okay.

1:54:12.232 --> 1:54:14.988
You're seeing a band. Did you kiss?

1:54:17.326 --> 1:54:19.163
A gentleman never tells.

1:54:19.246 --> 1:54:20.583
All right, so you kissed her.

1:54:20.666 --> 1:54:22.461
-Think what you want.
-I think you kissed her.

1:54:22.545 --> 1:54:24.841
-I'm not saying anything.
-I think you made out with her

1:54:24.925 --> 1:54:28.097
-until the sun came up, is what I think.
-Hey, what? Hey, what are you doing?

1:54:28.181 --> 1:54:30.310
-That's my pickle.
-I was eating a pickle,

1:54:30.393 --> 1:54:33.232
-is what I was doing.
-Get your own pickle. That's mine.

1:54:33.316 --> 1:54:37.282
Excuse me. I just want a bite
of a pickle. That's all I want.

1:54:37.366 --> 1:54:41.625
Well, if you want more pickles,
order more pickles. I was saving it.

1:54:42.292 --> 1:54:44.673
What? No, I just want a little bite.
I don't want a whole pickle.

1:54:44.756 --> 1:54:47.762
Okay, I think I'm gonna cut
a small piece--

1:54:47.845 --> 1:54:49.557
Fine. We will order
a whole plate of pickles.

1:54:49.641 --> 1:54:52.772
-Oh, yeah. Take it. Just take my pickle.
-Excuse me. We need a plate of pickles.

1:54:52.855 --> 1:54:54.901
-I don't like pickles!
-You don't like pickles?

1:54:54.985 --> 1:54:57.615
-Okay. So, why were you saving it?
-I-- Just because…

1:54:58.867 --> 1:55:01.205
-…save pickles.
-Save pickles?

1:55:01.288 --> 1:55:02.416
Yeah.

1:55:14.649 --> 1:55:16.903
Hey, don't move. Olivia. Don't move.

1:55:19.743 --> 1:55:20.745
Olivia!

1:55:21.580 --> 1:55:22.957
Look this way.
