WEBVTT

00:57.224 --> 01:00.975
Go!

05:20.737 --> 05:24.240
Looks
like the kid made it through.

05:25.325 --> 05:28.870
I win, you lose. Money?

05:31.206 --> 05:32.747
We didn't even dap on it dad.

05:32.749 --> 05:33.666
Ashley.

05:35.752 --> 05:37.335
Fine.

05:52.477 --> 05:53.353
Okay I'm sorry.

05:55.688 --> 05:57.522
My name's Christian.

05:57.524 --> 05:58.439
I was driving around

05:58.441 --> 06:00.274
the neighborhood and I got lost.

06:00.276 --> 06:01.651
So I figured I'd stop by your
house

06:01.653 --> 06:03.528
and ask for directions,
and I noticed your window

06:03.530 --> 06:05.071
was broken, so I thought I'd
just come in-

06:05.073 --> 06:06.491
- Christian, huh?

06:09.369 --> 06:14.121
Mark, Mark, Mark,
already in enough trouble

06:14.123 --> 06:15.540
as it is.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.585
Why you gotta go and lie to us?

06:18.628 --> 06:20.878
We don't like robbers.

06:20.880 --> 06:21.965
We don't like rapists.

06:23.508 --> 06:26.803
But if there's something
that we fucking hate

06:27.637 --> 06:29.345
it's liars.

06:29.347 --> 06:30.721
Ashley.

06:30.723 --> 06:31.558
Yeah?

06:33.142 --> 06:34.767
Can I ask you a
question?

06:34.769 --> 06:35.603
What's up?

06:36.521 --> 06:41.526
Why are you wearing
sneakers on my nice, clean,

06:41.860 --> 06:43.818
expensive carpet?

06:43.820 --> 06:45.528
For that matter, why are both of
you

06:45.530 --> 06:46.904
wearing your shoes in here?

06:46.906 --> 06:49.282
I mean, you know how
your mother and I feel

06:49.284 --> 06:51.450
- about shoes in the house.
- Sorry dad.

06:51.452 --> 06:53.454
Here, let me help you.

06:55.039 --> 06:58.749
Okay I'm sorry, I broke
in.

06:58.751 --> 06:59.919
It's a nice house.

07:04.007 --> 07:07.051
I'm aware that it's a nice
house.

07:08.011 --> 07:09.635
I bought this house.

07:09.637 --> 07:13.890
And the last thing I need is
you breaking into this house

07:13.892 --> 07:16.559
to tell me how nice my house is.

07:16.561 --> 07:19.729
You often go breaking and
entering into people's homes

07:19.731 --> 07:20.605
on Christmas Eve?

07:20.607 --> 07:24.483
Is this some kind of new game
you kids have these days?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.695
I said I'm sorry, and
I thought no one was home

07:27.697 --> 07:29.238
- so I-
- Oh you thought,

07:29.240 --> 07:30.865
'cause there was no one home,

07:30.867 --> 07:32.744
that would make everything okay.

07:37.081 --> 07:38.124
Excuse me one moment.

07:53.222 --> 07:54.305
Sir, what are you doing?

07:54.307 --> 07:58.436
Don't worry about
it, I've done this before.

08:01.898 --> 08:02.732
Pussy.

08:08.988 --> 08:12.659
There, that should
help with the swelling.

08:14.285 --> 08:18.164
I'm not so sure it's gonna help
with this.

08:19.123 --> 08:19.958
What is this?

08:21.167 --> 08:22.291
Am I bleeding?

08:22.293 --> 08:24.295
I don't know Mark, are you?

08:25.213 --> 08:27.588
I mean, why would you ask
me if you're bleeding.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.382
I mean, what makes you think

08:29.384 --> 08:31.217
we would know better than you

08:31.219 --> 08:33.844
about what's going on down
there?

08:33.846 --> 08:35.429
It's probably just a scratch.

08:35.431 --> 08:37.056
Probably from when you
were trying to rape me

08:37.058 --> 08:37.974
a few minutes ago.

08:37.976 --> 08:40.726
- I wasn't trying anything.
- Oh here we go again.

08:40.728 --> 08:43.020
I mean, just when we were
starting to get along,

08:43.022 --> 08:45.108
you start up again with the
lies.

08:46.693 --> 08:51.406
All right, my name is Thomas
Craven.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.907
My friends call me Thomas.

08:54.909 --> 08:56.661
- Mr. Crav-
- Uh, uh.

08:58.037 --> 08:59.370
Thomas.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.206
Better.

09:02.125 --> 09:03.708
I was wondering if I
could just explain to you

09:03.710 --> 09:04.544
the situation.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.211
I know, I know how it looks

09:07.213 --> 09:08.212
but I was wondering if
I could just explain-

09:08.214 --> 09:10.381
- Don't listen to his shit, dad.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.383
We aint got time for your
bullshit, Mark

09:12.385 --> 09:14.468
or whatever your fucking name
is.

09:14.470 --> 09:16.095
This motherfucker broke in here

09:16.097 --> 09:18.723
and tried to rape me right
where you're standing, dad.

09:18.725 --> 09:22.353
Aint no explaining it, aint
no fucking rocket science.

09:24.147 --> 09:27.064
Mark, give me a sec,
sweetheart,

09:27.066 --> 09:28.524
wanna sit over there?

09:28.526 --> 09:29.360
Thanks dad.

09:41.706 --> 09:46.002
Now, Mark isn't it?

09:47.170 --> 09:52.214
So, what's the story Morning
Glory?

09:52.216 --> 09:54.093
And how you making out with that
cut?

09:55.219 --> 09:57.887
I'm fine, this is
nothing.

09:57.889 --> 09:58.931
Splendid.

10:00.600 --> 10:02.558
I just wanted to
let you know Mr. Crave.

10:02.560 --> 10:03.394
Mmm mmm.

10:05.354 --> 10:06.189
Thomas.

10:07.774 --> 10:10.399
I just want to let you know
I've never done this before.

10:10.401 --> 10:13.027
I'm not a thief, I'm not a
criminal.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.738
I've never broken into a house
before.

10:15.740 --> 10:17.698
The truth is, I'm a father,

10:17.700 --> 10:19.992
I lost my job and I have a son

10:19.994 --> 10:24.246
and it's Christmas Eve, and
we're running out of money fast.

10:24.248 --> 10:26.165
I've never been in this
situation before.

10:26.167 --> 10:27.458
I don't even have enough money

10:27.460 --> 10:28.959
to get him a proper meal.

10:28.961 --> 10:30.211
If you just look into my wallet.

10:30.213 --> 10:32.046
Wait, wait, wait, where's his
wallet?

10:32.048 --> 10:33.925
I threw it in his face, it's
there.

10:43.351 --> 10:46.062
This?

10:47.230 --> 10:48.064
Yes.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.483
That's my boy.

10:51.484 --> 10:52.318
Cute kid.

10:55.488 --> 11:00.493
So tell me, why did you
choose this specific house

11:01.160 --> 11:04.537
and not the one on the left
or the one on the right

11:04.539 --> 11:06.789
or behind, or in front of the
house?

11:06.791 --> 11:08.126
Why this house?

11:09.252 --> 11:10.835
I don't know.

11:10.837 --> 11:12.837
It just seemed like a nice
house,

11:12.839 --> 11:16.884
so I figured, nice house
outside, nice things inside.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.593
And like I said, it seemed
like no one was home

11:19.595 --> 11:21.053
and on Christmas Eve that's
pretty

11:21.055 --> 11:22.429
- hard to find.
- He's like a

11:22.431 --> 11:25.599
bizarro Santa, instead of
sneaking in and leaving shit,

11:25.601 --> 11:27.935
he's sneaking in and stealing
shit.

11:27.937 --> 11:29.313
Make for a dope ass movie.

11:31.691 --> 11:32.565
- Honey-
- So you guys gonna

11:32.567 --> 11:33.985
call the cops?

11:35.236 --> 11:37.778
You don't leave us
much choice now do you?

11:37.780 --> 11:40.408
I mean, what would you do
if you were in my position?

11:41.409 --> 11:42.243
I guess.

11:44.036 --> 11:45.494
Gimme a second Mark.

11:45.496 --> 11:48.164
Can you be a sweetheart and go
outside

11:48.166 --> 11:49.125
and make the call?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.002
Sure dad.

11:56.465 --> 11:57.756
Attractive girl, huh?

11:57.758 --> 12:00.134
- No, I didn't-
- No, no, no it's all right,

12:00.136 --> 12:03.598
I don't mind, I mean, I was
your age once too you know.

12:05.808 --> 12:07.141
I guess.

12:07.143 --> 12:08.809
What?

12:08.811 --> 12:11.061
You calling my daughter ugly?

12:11.063 --> 12:12.980
No, I just don't want to
disrespect you.

12:16.360 --> 12:18.194
You're a funny guy.

12:18.196 --> 12:20.571
You don't want to disrespect me?

12:20.573 --> 12:22.907
Yet you break into my house,

12:22.909 --> 12:25.284
you attempt to rape my daughter

12:25.286 --> 12:28.495
and you don't have the
courtesy to compliment her

12:28.497 --> 12:29.747
on her looks?

12:29.749 --> 12:31.665
I don't call that respect, Mark.

12:31.667 --> 12:33.292
I call that hypocrisy.

12:33.294 --> 12:36.297
- I didn't mean to say it-
- Yeah you didn't, yeah.

12:41.219 --> 12:42.551
I'm starting to feel a little-

12:42.553 --> 12:44.555
- Can I ask you a
question?

12:45.556 --> 12:46.388
I guess.

12:46.390 --> 12:49.725
I mean this might be a tad
personal, so.

12:49.727 --> 12:50.561
Sure.

12:53.689 --> 12:55.149
Are you attracted to girls?

12:57.693 --> 12:59.777
By girls? Of course,
what are you trying to-

12:59.779 --> 13:01.278
- No, no, no,

13:01.280 --> 13:03.739
I don't mean to offend
you, it's just you know,

13:03.741 --> 13:06.742
we're gonna be sitting
here for quite some time

13:06.744 --> 13:08.244
waiting for the police to get
here.

13:08.246 --> 13:10.746
And being in this neighborhood,

13:10.748 --> 13:12.748
it could be quite a while
before they show up.

13:12.750 --> 13:14.917
I would expect the opposite
around here.

13:14.919 --> 13:17.378
Protect you rich folks
from us poor people.

13:17.380 --> 13:19.630
Yeah, I'd expect that too.

13:19.632 --> 13:20.549
I'd like that.

13:21.634 --> 13:25.678
But sadly, reality
sometimes falls quite far

13:25.680 --> 13:30.351
from expectations, sad.

13:31.727 --> 13:36.274
Now, we're gonna have some
time to get to know each other

13:37.149 --> 13:38.442
quite well, Mark.

13:40.111 --> 13:41.779
And that's a good thing isn't
it?

13:43.531 --> 13:44.365
What?

13:45.283 --> 13:48.701
You're saying you want to be
arrested?

13:48.703 --> 13:50.703
- It's not that but-
- You break into my house

13:50.705 --> 13:53.038
and now you can't wait to break
out?

13:53.040 --> 13:54.665
I don't know.

13:54.667 --> 13:55.958
I don't know how to say this but
like,

13:55.960 --> 13:57.753
- this whole situation-
- They're on their way.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.046
Said since we have
everything under control

14:01.048 --> 14:03.299
and he's tied up, might
take a little longer

14:03.301 --> 14:05.009
than it usually would.

14:05.011 --> 14:07.428
Some shit going on downtown, I
don't know.

14:07.430 --> 14:08.679
Well you should've told him

14:08.681 --> 14:10.180
that we have some nigger here
trying-

14:10.182 --> 14:13.434
- Dad! I hate when you use that
word.

14:13.436 --> 14:14.977
We're not in the 1940's anymore,

14:14.979 --> 14:15.978
what the fuck is wrong with you?

14:15.980 --> 14:18.605
You hear how she talks to me?

14:18.607 --> 14:21.025
Kids today, they're so
sensitive.

14:21.027 --> 14:23.402
You know, you can't call
a nigger a nigger now.

14:23.404 --> 14:25.404
You gotta say N-word.

14:25.406 --> 14:26.822
Or you could say Black person

14:26.824 --> 14:29.533
like every other
non-racist person post 1965

14:29.535 --> 14:31.327
- but who's counting?
- I'm counting.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.997
I'm surprised you can count.

14:34.623 --> 14:37.875
Fuck that shit dad.

14:37.877 --> 14:41.172
You really think he gives a
shit in the state he's in?

14:42.423 --> 14:43.714
What state?

14:43.716 --> 14:47.678
Remember that cut we
were looking at before?

14:49.013 --> 14:51.347
It turns out, it might be a lot
worse

14:51.349 --> 14:53.349
than we originally thought.

14:53.351 --> 14:54.185
What?

14:57.646 --> 15:01.315
What is this? I'm bleeding out
here.

15:01.317 --> 15:03.442
Can you check under my shirt
please?

15:03.444 --> 15:04.276
What is wrong with me?

15:04.278 --> 15:05.986
Can you lift up my shirt
for a second please?

15:05.988 --> 15:08.697
- You fucking did this to me.
- Hey, let me remind you

15:08.699 --> 15:11.325
that you're the one that
broke into my house.

15:11.327 --> 15:14.997
I am not the criminal
here, you are, not us.

15:20.294 --> 15:22.755
Can you look after our
friend for a while Ashley?

15:23.923 --> 15:25.925
I think I can do that.

15:34.392 --> 15:37.311
You know, I read somewhere

15:38.938 --> 15:41.897
worse thing you can do
when you're bleeding a lot

15:41.899 --> 15:45.111
is fall asleep, you might not
wake up.

15:46.779 --> 15:49.863
You know, I have an idea,
we should keep talking,

15:49.865 --> 15:51.450
keep you from falling asleep.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.535
I'm sorry but like, I don't
really

15:54.537 --> 15:55.871
wanna talk right now, so.

15:57.706 --> 16:00.207
All right, suit yourself.

16:00.209 --> 16:03.085
But if you start falling asleep,

16:03.087 --> 16:04.586
I aint gonna wake you up.

16:04.588 --> 16:06.713
Just saying, just trying to
help.

16:06.715 --> 16:08.465
Fine, what do you want to talk

16:08.467 --> 16:10.008
- about?
- Yes, okay!

16:10.010 --> 16:12.302
- I'll start, so-
- No, I'll start.

16:12.304 --> 16:14.596
Why do you care if I pass out or
whatever?

16:14.598 --> 16:15.431
I got caught robbing your house

16:15.433 --> 16:17.433
and I'm supposed to believe
you two are trying to help me

16:17.435 --> 16:18.269
or some shit?

16:20.271 --> 16:21.770
I don't know.

16:21.772 --> 16:25.107
I guess we're just good people
like that.

16:25.109 --> 16:27.276
Not everyone's a fucking
criminal, Mark.

16:27.278 --> 16:29.695
Why you gotta be so negative?

16:29.697 --> 16:32.406
I'm negative?

16:32.408 --> 16:33.407
You're the one that lied
about me trying to rape you

16:33.409 --> 16:35.033
and now I'm supposed to believe

16:35.035 --> 16:36.994
you didn't fuck with my stomach
too?

16:36.996 --> 16:40.082
We didn't fuck with your
stomach, okay?

16:42.543 --> 16:44.753
But who's to say you
didn't try and rape me?

16:47.465 --> 16:50.801
What, am I supposed to take
your fucking word for it?

16:53.095 --> 16:53.929
Were you?

16:55.181 --> 16:57.681
Were you trying to have sex with
me?

16:57.683 --> 16:59.810
I wasn't trying anything, you
know this.

17:01.103 --> 17:02.394
You fucking know this.

17:02.396 --> 17:07.401
So you weren't
trying to break into my house.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.364
Except for that.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.701
Are you sure Mark?

17:17.536 --> 17:20.122
Are you sure you weren't
trying to fuck me?

17:24.418 --> 17:26.877
What if I were to tell you

17:26.879 --> 17:28.881
that I want you to fuck me?

17:29.965 --> 17:34.053
Would you? Would you fuck me
Mark?

17:34.929 --> 17:35.969
What the fuck is wrong with
you?

17:35.971 --> 17:37.598
Get the fuck off of me.

17:39.016 --> 17:41.808
Chill you fucking pussy.

17:41.810 --> 17:44.811
Just trying to keep your ass
awake, bitch.

17:44.813 --> 17:49.485
You really think
I'd let you have sex with me?

17:50.778 --> 17:54.738
Oh, this is gonna be
the best Christmas ever.

17:54.740 --> 17:57.743
You're fucking crazy,
don't fucking talk to me.

17:58.869 --> 18:00.538
I told you not to do that
Mark.

18:01.830 --> 18:03.582
And there you go passing out
again.

18:04.542 --> 18:08.418
Oh and Mark, if you think this
is crazy

18:08.420 --> 18:10.798
you aint seen nothing yet.

18:21.809 --> 18:24.184
Oh, I feel so fucking lame

18:24.186 --> 18:26.478
walking around in this dumb
outfit.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.021
I was gonna go home and
change before I met you

18:28.023 --> 18:30.399
but I was supposed to be
home like, four hours ago.

18:30.401 --> 18:32.317
But of course, after the
pep rally we went to Stacy's

18:32.319 --> 18:33.527
for drinks and shit.

18:33.529 --> 18:35.237
Anyways, I forgot my keys at
home

18:35.239 --> 18:36.572
so I guess I'm gonna have to
sneak in

18:36.574 --> 18:38.115
up the window or some shit.

18:38.117 --> 18:40.327
Like I'm dressed for this shit
now.

18:41.829 --> 18:44.037
You would have went home to
change?

18:44.039 --> 18:46.667
You do know you're 30 minutes
late, right?

18:47.751 --> 18:50.794
Well, I can leave if you'd
like.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.254
No, that's not what I'm
saying.

18:52.256 --> 18:55.090
It's just, nevermind, forget it.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.093
Oh, Chris.

18:58.262 --> 18:59.179
It's okay.

19:04.435 --> 19:05.269
Forgiven.

19:06.604 --> 19:07.644
Now what are we eating?

19:07.646 --> 19:10.772
I'm fucking starving,
cheerleading is killing me.

19:10.774 --> 19:14.109
I don't know, what do you want
to eat?

19:14.111 --> 19:17.154
Fuck it, you decide for me.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.742
Surprise me, let's see
how well you know me.

19:20.909 --> 19:22.034
I barely know you.

19:22.036 --> 19:24.912
Come on, you're no fun
sometimes.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.498
You never wanna try anything.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.793
Okay, you know what?

19:31.795 --> 19:33.505
I think I do know what you'd
like.

19:35.257 --> 19:37.051
Excuse me? Miss?

19:38.552 --> 19:40.010
Miss?

19:40.012 --> 19:41.219
What are you calling her miss
for?

19:41.221 --> 19:42.640
She's like, younger than us.

19:43.849 --> 19:44.683
Yes?

19:45.851 --> 19:49.229
Can I get the deluxe
burger and no cheese please.

19:51.148 --> 19:51.980
Pickles on there?

19:51.982 --> 19:53.859
Oh, no thanks, I can't stand
pickles.

19:55.569 --> 19:57.653
All right, and what
will the lady be having?

19:57.655 --> 20:00.155
Bring her a Philly
cheese steak.

20:00.157 --> 20:02.701
Oh, interesting
choice.

20:03.702 --> 20:05.494
All right, coming right up.

20:05.496 --> 20:07.996
Anything else you guys
want, just give me a buzz.

20:07.998 --> 20:08.832
Thanks.

20:09.792 --> 20:11.625
Why can't you like,
ever order for yourself?

20:11.627 --> 20:12.834
I mean, it's kinda stressful

20:12.836 --> 20:15.212
to always guess what you want to
eat.

20:15.214 --> 20:18.548
I don't know, I think if
we were right for each other

20:18.550 --> 20:19.841
you should be able to know what
I want

20:19.843 --> 20:21.259
more than I could know what I
want.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.970
I mean, it's a lot of
pressure.

20:23.972 --> 20:26.308
Pressure is good, it
keeps you on your toes.

20:30.020 --> 20:30.854
Chris?

20:32.231 --> 20:33.689
Mhmm?

20:33.691 --> 20:36.066
Where's my Christmas present?

20:36.068 --> 20:38.237
Well it's not Christmas yet.

20:39.154 --> 20:41.949
Well, it's Christmas Eve, so.

20:42.950 --> 20:44.868
Don't worry, I'll get you your
gift.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.079
Well guess what?

20:47.955 --> 20:50.831
You won't have to guess
what I want this time.

20:50.833 --> 20:53.210
I know exactly what I want.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.253
And the best part is,

20:56.255 --> 20:58.507
you won't even have to
spend any money on it.

20:59.550 --> 21:01.633
If we're talking about what
you want,

21:01.635 --> 21:03.009
then what did you want to talk
about

21:03.011 --> 21:05.303
that was like, too sensitive to
talk about

21:05.305 --> 21:06.140
over the phone?

21:07.725 --> 21:09.683
Was it really that big of
a deal for you to meet me?

21:09.685 --> 21:10.517
No, no, no.

21:10.519 --> 21:11.435
Didn't you want to see your
girlfriend

21:11.437 --> 21:14.604
- on Christmas Eve?
- I didn't mean it like that.

21:14.606 --> 21:17.190
Okay, if you don't
want

21:17.192 --> 21:18.400
just say you don't want.

21:18.402 --> 21:21.027
No need to make a big
fucking deal out of it.

21:21.029 --> 21:22.281
Sounds pretty serious.

21:23.407 --> 21:26.950
Well, I heard something.

21:26.952 --> 21:27.786
Like what?

21:28.871 --> 21:31.538
Like, something.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.540
Okay well I'm hearing
something all the time.

21:33.542 --> 21:35.876
Literally hearing something
every day.

21:35.878 --> 21:37.004
Specific, Ashley.

21:37.963 --> 21:40.340
Something surprising.

21:44.845 --> 21:45.927
What the fuck was that?

21:45.929 --> 21:48.346
That was surprising.

21:48.348 --> 21:49.765
You know, I'm getting
really sick and tired

21:49.767 --> 21:51.099
of your little bitch ass
attitude

21:51.101 --> 21:52.476
I've seen over the past few
weeks.

21:52.478 --> 21:54.603
Hey, look I'm sorry.

21:54.605 --> 21:55.937
What did you hear?

22:18.462 --> 22:19.296
Okay.

22:20.798 --> 22:21.632
- So?
- What?

22:22.591 --> 22:23.759
What did you hear?

22:24.968 --> 22:26.804
Oh yeah, nevermind, let's just
eat.

22:27.679 --> 22:29.262
Fuck Ashley, I didn't
come here for a burger,

22:29.264 --> 22:30.265
I have food at home.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.226
Talking about how the food is,

22:34.228 --> 22:35.977
how's that cheese steak?

22:35.979 --> 22:39.024
Well, let's see.

22:52.287 --> 22:53.121
Good.

22:55.207 --> 22:58.043
This tastes like a fucking
orgasm.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.505
That's a weird comparison.

23:04.299 --> 23:06.885
All right, fine.

23:08.262 --> 23:10.679
But this stays between us,
right?

23:10.681 --> 23:11.932
Mhmm.

23:12.808 --> 23:13.640
Pinky.

23:13.642 --> 23:15.143
Okay, I'm not pinky swearing
you.

23:17.938 --> 23:21.940
I heard...

23:21.942 --> 23:22.776
Mhmm.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.821
That...

23:27.823 --> 23:28.657
Yeah?

23:31.618 --> 23:32.995
You killed someone before.

23:34.997 --> 23:35.831
Is it true?

23:58.186 --> 23:59.146
Oh shit, hey.

24:00.522 --> 24:02.608
Didn't know if you were
coming back or not.

24:04.860 --> 24:06.528
Why did you let me fall
asleep?

24:07.696 --> 24:09.070
I told you I wasn't gonna wake
you up.

24:09.072 --> 24:11.325
Think I'm a liar, Mark?

24:12.200 --> 24:15.702
Where's your dad? Thought
he went to call 9-1-1.

24:15.704 --> 24:17.329
First you don't want
to talk

24:17.331 --> 24:20.498
and now you don't want to shut
up.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.208
Gotta make up your mind, Mark.

24:22.210 --> 24:24.502
I'm really not feeling
too well right now.

24:24.504 --> 24:27.466
No shit, you're like,
totally bleeding out.

24:28.800 --> 24:30.093
Isn't your dad a doctor?

24:31.053 --> 24:32.302
Think he could check me out?

24:32.304 --> 24:33.931
Check you out?

24:35.015 --> 24:37.223
I don't think he rolls that way.

24:37.225 --> 24:38.433
That's not what I meant.

24:38.435 --> 24:41.519
No, but seriously.

24:41.521 --> 24:43.104
Him? A doctor?

24:43.106 --> 24:45.357
No, a shrink.

24:45.359 --> 24:47.776
A shrink isn't a real doctor.

24:47.778 --> 24:49.486
But if you have any mommy issues

24:49.488 --> 24:51.488
he might be able to help you
out.

24:51.490 --> 24:52.866
Isn't that the same thing?

24:55.577 --> 24:58.246
Is a robber the same thing as
a rapist?

24:59.623 --> 25:01.206
Not even close.

25:01.208 --> 25:02.042
Same thing.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.504
So your dad's a shrink?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.341
Yes, Mark.

25:11.635 --> 25:13.011
Well that explains a lot.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.262
What is that supposed to mean?

25:16.264 --> 25:18.100
Hey, sorry for the
delay.

25:19.184 --> 25:20.892
Your mom's home.

25:20.894 --> 25:22.980
Family reunion, dining room.

25:23.814 --> 25:25.355
Mark and I are just in the
middle of something here-

25:25.357 --> 25:26.898
- Ashley.

25:26.900 --> 25:28.525
Let's go.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.903
Fine, chill.

25:32.155 --> 25:35.073
But who's gonna watch over
our little birdy here?

25:35.075 --> 25:37.536
Little birdy, stay.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.662
See? Let's go.

25:47.838 --> 25:49.713
Hi Ashley.

25:49.715 --> 25:50.964
Hi mom.

25:50.966 --> 25:52.757
What did you do this
time?

25:52.759 --> 25:54.592
What do you mean what I did
this time?

25:54.594 --> 25:57.679
Watch your tone, is
that how I raised you?

25:57.681 --> 26:00.098
I don't know, how
did you fucking raise me?

26:00.100 --> 26:03.435
Can you two calm down please.

26:03.437 --> 26:05.061
We're all in the same boat here

26:05.063 --> 26:07.522
and that boat is sinking fast.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.734
I mean, can we all just
work together as a team?

26:10.736 --> 26:11.943
Just for tonight?

26:11.945 --> 26:13.445
And then when all is said and
done

26:13.447 --> 26:16.406
you two can go back to hating
each other.

26:16.408 --> 26:18.700
But for now, we're in a big mess
here,

26:18.702 --> 26:21.286
- a big fucking mess.
- How is this such a big mess?

26:21.288 --> 26:23.038
The way I see it, it's
all pretty fucking simple.

26:23.040 --> 26:24.080
We just let him go.

26:24.082 --> 26:26.541
He takes off into the night,
fade out, roll credits,

26:26.543 --> 26:29.044
end of story, what's the big
deal?

26:29.046 --> 26:30.336
Am I missing something?

26:30.338 --> 26:31.671
You two aren't actually thinking

26:31.673 --> 26:33.506
of calling the cops are you?

26:33.508 --> 26:34.549
Should I take this

26:34.551 --> 26:36.968
or do you want to do the honors?

26:36.970 --> 26:37.804
Allow me.

26:39.097 --> 26:44.017
Honey, let's put all the
potential options

26:44.019 --> 26:46.436
and outcomes on the table.

26:46.438 --> 26:47.270
A very good idea.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.191
Option number one, we let him
go.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.943
He's seriously wounded
and severely bleeding.

26:53.945 --> 26:56.154
The way I see it, if he
doesn't get to a doctor

26:56.156 --> 26:57.697
in the next few hours,

26:57.699 --> 26:59.574
it's curtains for him.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.159
So we let him go.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.202
Now I don't know about you

27:02.204 --> 27:05.371
but I'm pretty damn sure
that's a stab wound.

27:05.373 --> 27:06.208
What?

27:07.584 --> 27:09.501
Who, between you two geniuses,

27:09.503 --> 27:11.836
decided that it would be
a good idea to stab him?

27:11.838 --> 27:13.338
Well I know I didn't

27:13.340 --> 27:15.465
and from what I've
seen, I'm pretty certain

27:15.467 --> 27:16.758
Ashley didn't either.

27:16.760 --> 27:19.052
So, to answer your question,

27:19.054 --> 27:21.014
I don't fucking know.

27:25.519 --> 27:27.852
Don't look at
me, I don't fucking know.

27:27.854 --> 27:31.523
Ha ha oh okay, so he
breaks into the house,

27:31.525 --> 27:33.566
seemingly un-stabbed, you three
bozos

27:33.568 --> 27:34.651
get into a playground scuffle,

27:34.653 --> 27:36.736
then all of sudden he's
just magically stabbed.

27:36.738 --> 27:37.862
That's your story.

27:37.864 --> 27:39.030
Dad, why are we wasting our
time

27:39.032 --> 27:40.365
with Sherlock Holmes here?

27:40.367 --> 27:42.784
We were doing just fine
until she showed up.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.994
Yes, you were doing
just peachy, trust me,

27:44.996 --> 27:45.829
if I knew what you dickheads
were up to

27:45.831 --> 27:47.872
I'd be across the state line by
now.

27:47.874 --> 27:49.791
Can I continue?

27:49.793 --> 27:51.044
I mean, are you two done?

27:52.420 --> 27:53.630
Please proceed.

27:55.340 --> 27:58.174
Okay, so we let him go.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.426
I don't know about you, but how
much trust

28:00.428 --> 28:02.220
do you want to put on a thief?

28:02.222 --> 28:03.555
I mean, all it will take

28:03.557 --> 28:05.431
is for him to just point us out

28:05.433 --> 28:06.266
and then we're fucked.

28:06.268 --> 28:09.060
I don't know, I mean, maybe
we are overthinking this.

28:09.062 --> 28:10.645
I mean really, what is he gonna
do?

28:10.647 --> 28:13.356
Go to the cops and be like,
"Yeah I broke into this house

28:13.358 --> 28:14.774
and this chick beat me up

28:14.776 --> 28:17.443
and here's her address."

28:17.445 --> 28:21.156
It's unlikely, but I
think your father's right

28:21.158 --> 28:22.240
on this one.

28:22.242 --> 28:23.825
We can't take this lightly.

28:23.827 --> 28:26.286
He got into our house, he
knows what we look like.

28:26.288 --> 28:29.080
Well, what you two look like.

28:29.082 --> 28:31.124
You beat him up, tied him up.

28:31.126 --> 28:33.209
All it takes is for him to
tell one of his compadres

28:33.211 --> 28:35.336
then who knows where that could
lead us.

28:35.338 --> 28:37.505
We can't take that chance.

28:37.507 --> 28:39.926
So our only option is
what I think it is then.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.803
I don't want to do that.

28:43.805 --> 28:45.388
I don't want to do that
either.

28:45.390 --> 28:47.557
But I don't know, I mean,
what else can we do?

28:47.559 --> 28:49.184
I'm fine with it, really.

28:49.186 --> 28:51.603
Ashley calm down, did one of
you forget

28:51.605 --> 28:52.562
to lock the doors or something?

28:52.564 --> 28:54.022
How the hell did he get in here?

28:54.024 --> 28:55.398
Broke the window.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.233
Ugh, of course he did.

28:57.235 --> 28:59.110
These fancy houses got so many
windows,

28:59.112 --> 29:00.655
we might as well sleep outside.

29:01.865 --> 29:05.241
All right, I'm
gonna go talk to the guy.

29:05.243 --> 29:07.329
Talk to him? Fuh what?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.955
Fuh? What's fuh?

29:10.957 --> 29:13.416
Vietnamese soup? Where are your
R's?

29:13.418 --> 29:15.251
You're too cool to use R's now?

29:15.253 --> 29:16.127
Thomas, listen to your daughter,

29:16.129 --> 29:17.420
talking like a fucking nigger.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.797
She's not getting that
from me, that's for sure.

29:19.799 --> 29:22.175
You two make a great
couple, y'all know that?

29:22.177 --> 29:23.803
And that's the thanks we get.

29:24.679 --> 29:27.180
All right, I'm gonna talk to
him.

29:27.182 --> 29:28.681
Fuck what you two think,
I need to size him up

29:28.683 --> 29:30.058
- for myself.
- You know this motherfucker

29:30.060 --> 29:31.811
tried to rape me, right?

29:34.022 --> 29:35.398
Dad, you told her right?

29:36.399 --> 29:37.357
I told her.

29:37.359 --> 29:38.858
Ashley, listen to me.

29:38.860 --> 29:39.943
We're not just gonna go do

29:39.945 --> 29:41.110
what you think we're gonna do

29:41.112 --> 29:42.445
just because you think we should
do it.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.030
This is not just fucking getting
dressed

29:44.032 --> 29:44.864
in the morning, all right?

29:44.866 --> 29:46.032
This this is a big deal.

29:46.034 --> 29:48.034
Now, we've got a few hours
until the sun comes up.

29:48.036 --> 29:50.328
We need to figure this out,
okay?

29:50.330 --> 29:52.247
Thomas, okay?

29:52.249 --> 29:53.414
Your mother's right.

29:53.416 --> 29:56.042
I mean, we have to take this
seriously.

29:56.044 --> 29:58.964
I mean, we cannot take this
lightly.

30:03.218 --> 30:04.052
All right.

30:05.512 --> 30:06.678
Fine then, talk to him.

30:06.680 --> 30:08.221
See if I fucking care.

30:08.223 --> 30:09.057
Ashley.

30:12.143 --> 30:17.148
You know, it was you who
always wanted a daughter.

30:18.108 --> 30:20.692
I mean, if you're ever gonna act
on it,

30:20.694 --> 30:23.569
I think tonight might be as good
a night

30:23.571 --> 30:25.238
as you'll ever get.

30:42.924 --> 30:44.674
I knew you'd forget
to introduce yourself

30:44.676 --> 30:45.552
to the neighbors.

30:47.012 --> 30:49.012
I'm gonna go get them
a nice bottle of wine

30:49.014 --> 30:50.680
and make a great first
impression

30:50.682 --> 30:52.434
just like they do in the movies.

30:53.435 --> 30:55.351
Shit, I bet five bucks you
wouldn't.

30:55.353 --> 30:57.937
We both know I'm the responsible
one.

30:57.939 --> 30:59.605
You're joking, right?

30:59.607 --> 31:02.150
Not joking, actually speaking
facts.

31:02.152 --> 31:02.984
Facts, yeah.

31:02.986 --> 31:05.153
Are you sure you have
the right definition?

31:05.155 --> 31:06.696
Have you looked up the meaning?

31:06.698 --> 31:09.657
I did, and it said that I'm
always right

31:09.659 --> 31:11.951
and you're always fucking wrong.

31:11.953 --> 31:13.330
That's what it said anyways.

31:14.205 --> 31:16.706
Yeah, well you're a
funny woman you know that?

31:16.708 --> 31:18.958
That's why I married you.

31:18.960 --> 31:19.961
Your sense of humor.

31:24.716 --> 31:28.009
I always thought it was
because of my ass but,

31:28.011 --> 31:30.720
I guess sense of humor makes
it sound more romantic.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.140
Well you're welcome.

31:34.100 --> 31:35.558
You know what?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.185
Sending the kid to the arcade
tonight

31:37.187 --> 31:38.603
was actually a pretty good idea.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.771
Sending the kid any night

31:39.773 --> 31:41.024
is always a good idea.

31:41.983 --> 31:44.150
Look, I told you, you're
worried for nothing.

31:44.152 --> 31:46.488
It's just the arcade,
it's a good neighborhood.

31:47.614 --> 31:49.906
And we can't keep treating
her like a baby anymore.

31:49.908 --> 31:53.368
She needs to learn to do things
on her own, make friends.

31:53.370 --> 31:55.828
It's essential to the
development of a good teenager.

31:55.830 --> 31:57.455
Let me know when we're
speaking English again.

31:57.457 --> 31:59.123
Ha ha.

31:59.125 --> 32:00.750
Is she back yet?

32:00.752 --> 32:05.004
I don't know, who cares?

32:05.006 --> 32:06.466
I think you're hard on her.

32:08.635 --> 32:09.801
I know she's not always easy

32:09.803 --> 32:12.597
but it's just, she's a kid.

32:13.515 --> 32:15.056
This is normal kid bullshit.

32:15.058 --> 32:17.266
We were kids once, remember?

32:17.268 --> 32:18.311
Years ago.

32:19.312 --> 32:22.941
First of all, I don't like
this years ago thing at all.

32:24.234 --> 32:28.486
I don't know, I just, I feel
like something's off with her.

32:28.488 --> 32:32.031
Just try and not be
too hard on her, okay?

32:32.033 --> 32:33.991
She needs time to adapt.

32:33.993 --> 32:35.952
Plus, she just moved into
a completely new city,

32:35.954 --> 32:38.454
this is not easy for her.

32:38.456 --> 32:40.375
Grace, she's going to need her
mother.

32:41.459 --> 32:44.544
I swear, something's
wrong with your daughter.

32:44.546 --> 32:46.754
Look, I'm sorry but we both know
this.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.173
And don't try to psychoanalyze
our relationship now.

32:49.175 --> 32:50.009
Fine.

32:53.012 --> 32:53.970
I thought the goal of tonight

32:53.972 --> 32:56.933
was to forget about the kid
and work and everything.

32:58.017 --> 33:00.395
Do we really need to talk
about this right now?

33:02.439 --> 33:04.649
You're right. I'm sorry.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.821
It's okay. I'm happy.

33:11.823 --> 33:13.074
We're celebrating, right?

33:13.950 --> 33:14.784
Yeah.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.578
What are we celebrating?

33:18.580 --> 33:22.081
We're celebrating no phone
lines.

33:22.083 --> 33:24.210
No your mother living upstairs
from us.

33:25.712 --> 33:28.588
And soon, no clothes.

33:28.590 --> 33:30.882
You just can't keep your
hands off me, can you?

33:30.884 --> 33:32.302
When I can I ever?

33:37.974 --> 33:40.224
Fuck dinner, I always wanted to
do it

33:40.226 --> 33:42.602
on the mattress on the floor.

33:42.604 --> 33:44.939
Yeah, mattress on the floor is
very fun.

33:45.940 --> 33:47.317
- I hate you.
- Prove it.

34:17.597 --> 34:20.264
I'm really not feeling too
well.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.350
Is there still nothing from the
ambulance?

34:22.352 --> 34:23.728
What's taking them so long?

34:25.939 --> 34:29.859
Hi. What's his name again?

34:32.028 --> 34:33.694
What's your name again?

34:33.696 --> 34:36.741
Mark, and I'm in need of an
ambulance.

34:37.825 --> 34:39.283
What sort of fucking
games are we playing here?

34:39.285 --> 34:41.160
What's the matter with you
people?

34:41.162 --> 34:42.662
I don't care if you live in
Timbuktu,

34:42.664 --> 34:44.832
ambulances don't take this long
to arrive.

34:47.252 --> 34:49.085
Oh my god.

34:49.087 --> 34:52.004
Has he been this much
fun this entire time?

34:52.006 --> 34:53.965
No wonder you guys

34:53.967 --> 34:55.843
wanted to keep him all for
yourselves.

34:56.928 --> 35:00.390
Oh, I'm all excited.

35:01.391 --> 35:06.396
All right Mark, are you even
listening?

35:15.613 --> 35:19.907
Let me break
this down into simple terms.

35:19.909 --> 35:24.620
You really picked the wrong
fucking family to rob tonight.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.539
The ambulance.

35:26.541 --> 35:28.791
Their aint no ambulance coming

35:28.793 --> 35:31.168
you fucking idiot.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.461
What do you mean there's
no ambulance coming?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.839
What are you talking about?

35:34.841 --> 35:36.257
You called the cops?

35:36.259 --> 35:37.800
They would've taken me to the
hospital-

35:37.802 --> 35:40.386
- Oh my god.

35:40.388 --> 35:43.598
There's no cops coming,
there's no ambulance coming.

35:43.600 --> 35:45.977
Aint nobody coming Mark.

35:47.312 --> 35:48.644
But you called.

35:48.646 --> 35:51.022
Actually, I pretended to call.

35:51.024 --> 35:55.236
Actually, I didn't call jack
shit.

35:56.237 --> 35:59.739
Yeah, not very smart,
that's what I thought.

35:59.741 --> 36:02.325
You know what? I wanted to bet
on it.

36:02.327 --> 36:03.326
But I didn't.

36:03.328 --> 36:05.369
You know that feeling when
you just know something

36:05.371 --> 36:06.871
but you don't say it?

36:06.873 --> 36:09.540
Like you think, oh, what if I'm
wrong?

36:09.542 --> 36:11.667
I don't want to look stupid.

36:11.669 --> 36:14.337
But then every time you didn't
say it,

36:14.339 --> 36:16.422
ah, maybe not every time

36:16.424 --> 36:18.092
but it feels like every time.

36:19.344 --> 36:21.552
I'll just say it, every time.

36:21.554 --> 36:24.555
You were right, you were fucking
right.

36:24.557 --> 36:25.640
You want to tell your friends,

36:25.642 --> 36:26.849
I knew this was gonna happen

36:26.851 --> 36:27.892
but I just didn't say it.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.855
Yup, I get that all the time.

36:32.231 --> 36:33.189
Like for me, usually it's when

36:33.191 --> 36:34.190
I'm watching a movie, right?

36:34.192 --> 36:36.442
Like, you just know what like,
a character's gonna say next

36:36.444 --> 36:38.110
like everything just lines up
for like,

36:38.112 --> 36:41.405
you're sure of it.

36:41.407 --> 36:44.867
Sometimes it's these like,
corny lines or whatever

36:44.869 --> 36:45.826
but sometimes it's actually
things

36:45.828 --> 36:47.328
that are pretty hard to guess.

36:47.330 --> 36:48.913
And you don't say it.

36:48.915 --> 36:52.458
You think, shit, if I say it

36:52.460 --> 36:54.710
at the exact same time as the
character,

36:54.712 --> 36:57.465
everyone in the room is
gonna be so impressed.

36:58.633 --> 37:00.758
But you stop yourself, oh.

37:00.760 --> 37:02.593
And then sure enough, the
character says

37:02.595 --> 37:05.930
the exact line you thought
he or she was gonna say.

37:05.932 --> 37:08.933
And then you turn to
your friends

37:08.935 --> 37:11.936
and you're like I
knew he was gonna say that

37:11.938 --> 37:16.440
and they go like, yeah,
okay.

37:16.442 --> 37:19.360
Most annoying thing ever, right?

37:19.362 --> 37:21.114
What the fuck are you talking
about?

37:21.989 --> 37:25.410
Huh, what am I talking about?

37:26.536 --> 37:30.162
No ambulances are
coming, no cops are coming.

37:30.164 --> 37:32.123
So what, you guys are
just gonna let me go?

37:32.125 --> 37:34.083
I don't know Mark, I don't
know yet.

37:34.085 --> 37:35.668
Depends on you actually.

37:35.670 --> 37:38.087
But if you don't let me go,
then what?

37:38.089 --> 37:40.925
I'm pretty sure you can draw
your own conclusions Mark.

37:42.093 --> 37:43.801
What is this? Is this some
sort of joke?

37:43.803 --> 37:46.470
I wish this was a
joke

37:46.472 --> 37:48.514
but this is serious.

37:48.516 --> 37:51.892
As serious as an HIV test,

37:51.894 --> 37:53.811
that's how serious this is.

37:53.813 --> 37:55.773
That shit is serious.

37:56.774 --> 37:58.818
Let me go you fucking psychos.

38:00.570 --> 38:05.533
Aw Mark, she just wants
to talk to you okay?

38:06.701 --> 38:09.618
I promise I won't let her hurt
you

38:09.620 --> 38:11.328
unless you deserve it, okay?

38:11.330 --> 38:13.789
Don't fucking touch me.

38:13.791 --> 38:16.625
You're fucking crazy. All
of you are fucking crazy.

38:16.627 --> 38:19.712
Let me go, let me go! Let me go!

38:19.714 --> 38:24.425
Stop calling me crazy, Mark.

38:24.427 --> 38:26.971
I don't like people calling me
crazy.

38:28.055 --> 38:32.935
I won't touch you, but just
stop calling me that okay?

38:34.604 --> 38:39.025
I asked you a fucking question,
okay?

38:40.026 --> 38:40.860
Okay.

38:41.694 --> 38:44.195
All right Ashley, we get it.

38:44.197 --> 38:45.531
Stop swinging your dick.

38:47.492 --> 38:51.412
I said I would talk to him so
let's talk.

38:54.082 --> 38:55.581
So you guys are not
gonna let me go are you?

38:55.583 --> 38:58.667
I told you Mark, I don't know
yet.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.211
We can't just let you get back
out there

39:00.213 --> 39:01.837
if you're gonna talk to people
about us.

39:01.839 --> 39:03.422
Talk about what?

39:03.424 --> 39:04.965
I don't even know who you guys
are.

39:04.967 --> 39:08.469
Mmm, I think you know too much
already.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.179
And why would I talk
about the house I broke into

39:10.181 --> 39:12.681
and got my ass kicked by a
little kid?

39:12.683 --> 39:13.849
Who you calling a
kid?

39:13.851 --> 39:15.976
And woke up tied to a
chair on some S&M shit,

39:15.978 --> 39:18.312
why the fuck would I want to
talk to anyone about that?

39:18.314 --> 39:21.190
- That's what I said.
- No one asked you Ashley.

39:21.192 --> 39:24.235
Your role in this story is
to be the pretty girl, okay?

39:24.237 --> 39:26.570
So play the part.

39:26.572 --> 39:27.406
Bitch.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.783
Are they always like
this?

39:30.785 --> 39:33.869
Actually, this is a good day.

39:33.871 --> 39:36.413
All right, can we
focus for a minute here?

39:36.415 --> 39:39.124
Happy you two are getting
along so well, that's great.

39:39.126 --> 39:40.626
Look, he's not a bad kid.

39:40.628 --> 39:43.963
He just got mixed up in a bad
situation.

39:43.965 --> 39:46.841
True, except for the whole
raping your daughter and shit.

39:46.843 --> 39:47.675
Great guy.

39:47.677 --> 39:48.968
I wasn't trying to rape you.

39:48.970 --> 39:51.095
When are you gonna get
that in your fucking head?

39:51.097 --> 39:52.721
You guys better let me go this
time.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.473
You better let me go,
you better let me go!

39:54.475 --> 39:55.268
Let me go!

39:56.477 --> 39:57.977
So that's how
you want to do this?

39:57.979 --> 39:59.730
Help! Anyone, help!

40:02.233 --> 40:04.525
All right Ashley, shut him up.

40:04.527 --> 40:08.863
- What? Seriously?
- Before I change my mind.

40:08.865 --> 40:10.656
I'm killing
him though, right?

40:10.658 --> 40:12.658
No, no, wait, wait, who said
anything

40:12.660 --> 40:13.703
about killing anyone?

40:39.520 --> 40:43.024
All right, what did you bring?

40:46.152 --> 40:48.277
I promise I'll be quiet, I
swear.

40:48.279 --> 40:49.153
Just please don't hurt me.

40:49.155 --> 40:51.032
Are you sure you'll be quiet?

40:51.866 --> 40:53.032
Like Ashley just went through

40:53.034 --> 40:55.117
- the entire-
- Yes, I promise.

40:55.119 --> 40:57.369
Silence of the lambs, I swear.

40:57.371 --> 40:59.622
Ashley, hold that thought
okay?

40:59.624 --> 41:00.456
But mom.

41:00.458 --> 41:01.832
Ashley.

41:07.131 --> 41:08.005
I think I have an idea.

41:08.007 --> 41:09.924
Oh, do tell.

41:09.926 --> 41:11.844
Would Mark happen to be a
father?

41:13.220 --> 41:16.972
Actually, Mark would
happen to be a father.

41:16.974 --> 41:18.307
He's got a cute little kid.

41:18.309 --> 41:23.395
In fact, that's why he breaks
into houses on Christmas

41:23.397 --> 41:25.940
daddy dearest.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.859
I told you, I've never done
this before.

41:28.861 --> 41:30.694
My back's against the wall.

41:30.696 --> 41:31.904
What would you do if you
couldn't afford

41:31.906 --> 41:33.697
to buy your daughter a meal?

41:33.699 --> 41:34.531
Let her die?

41:34.533 --> 41:37.159
Mmm, shit happens.

41:37.161 --> 41:38.661
Kids die every day.

41:38.663 --> 41:40.454
People die, so what?

41:40.456 --> 41:42.414
Now Grace, that's enough.

41:42.416 --> 41:45.876
Even in this situation, you
can't keep your shit together?

41:45.878 --> 41:49.171
I mean, what did she
ever do that was so bad?

41:49.173 --> 41:51.423
Do we really have to do this
now?

41:51.425 --> 41:54.551
Yes, we really do have to do
this now.

41:54.553 --> 41:56.261
You seem to want to do it now

41:56.263 --> 41:58.389
which means I have to do it now.

41:58.391 --> 42:01.433
I mean, I don't care if we
have the fucking pope over

42:01.435 --> 42:05.396
for dinner, you don't talk
about our daughter that way.

42:05.398 --> 42:09.068
Our daughter. Right.

42:10.736 --> 42:13.114
Perfect little Ashley.

42:16.534 --> 42:21.745
Just, what was that idea you
mentioned

42:21.747 --> 42:22.707
a little while ago?

42:24.208 --> 42:26.292
Mark, what does your son look
like?

42:26.294 --> 42:28.127
Actually, there's a picture
down there.

42:28.129 --> 42:29.547
Hmm, honey would you mind?

42:30.715 --> 42:33.134
I have to do everything around
here.

42:34.844 --> 42:36.677
Why do you want a picture of
my son?

42:36.679 --> 42:38.262
Simple, Mark.

42:38.264 --> 42:40.014
Here's how this will play out.

42:40.016 --> 42:42.057
Listen closely, because
this is your only chance

42:42.059 --> 42:43.434
to get out of this.

42:43.436 --> 42:46.895
I'll try to say it as clearly as
I can.

42:46.897 --> 42:48.439
Oh, wait, by the way

42:48.441 --> 42:50.401
are you a righty or a lefty?

42:51.444 --> 42:52.278
Right.

42:53.154 --> 42:55.571
I will untie your right hand.

42:55.573 --> 42:57.906
In your hand, I will place a
pencil.

42:57.908 --> 42:59.950
Under that pencil will be
a small piece of paper.

42:59.952 --> 43:03.037
On that piece of paper, you
will write the following.

43:03.039 --> 43:04.621
Your son's Christian name

43:04.623 --> 43:07.416
followed by his family
name, in that order.

43:07.418 --> 43:08.959
Underneath that, you will write
down

43:08.961 --> 43:11.295
his social security number.

43:11.297 --> 43:13.299
Wait, how old is your kid?

43:14.592 --> 43:15.676
He's six.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.094
Okay, then he has one for
sure.

43:19.096 --> 43:21.889
Just that before 1986, some
parents could sometimes

43:21.891 --> 43:23.974
have kids well above
the age of 14 years old

43:23.976 --> 43:26.685
and not get them their
social security numbers.

43:26.687 --> 43:28.937
But at the end of 1985,
they stopped all that.

43:28.939 --> 43:30.731
Now you can't basically
go above like five,

43:30.733 --> 43:32.107
without registering your kids.

43:32.109 --> 43:34.943
Hmm, the more you know.

43:34.945 --> 43:38.739
Anyway, we will need that
number.

43:38.741 --> 43:40.741
Underneath that number,
we will need the name

43:40.743 --> 43:42.910
of his school, then under that

43:42.912 --> 43:44.620
we'll need his date of birth

43:44.622 --> 43:47.790
and then the city and
hospital in which he was born.

43:47.792 --> 43:49.249
Wait, why should I give
you all this information

43:49.251 --> 43:50.542
about my son?

43:50.544 --> 43:52.252
What keeps me from telling
you both to fuck off

43:52.254 --> 43:54.546
and I aint giving y'all shit?

43:54.548 --> 43:55.800
That's a good question.

43:57.384 --> 43:58.260
Here's an idea.

44:00.012 --> 44:02.515
Supposing he doesn't tell us.

44:03.599 --> 44:06.308
We've got enough to find him.

44:06.310 --> 44:09.436
So we bring them both to the
basement,

44:09.438 --> 44:12.523
we kill the little
bastard in front of him,

44:12.525 --> 44:14.691
we leave the kid to rot

44:14.693 --> 44:17.820
and then we keep him
alive by force feeding him

44:17.822 --> 44:21.323
until there's nothing left but
rot.

44:21.325 --> 44:23.828
And then we kill him.

44:24.954 --> 44:26.662
I just thought about that.

44:26.664 --> 44:28.163
I mean, can we just do that?

44:28.165 --> 44:28.999
No.

44:30.417 --> 44:32.795
Is that enough? It's good for
me.

44:35.131 --> 44:37.214
What are you guys
gonna do with all that?

44:37.216 --> 44:38.551
Simple, Mark.

44:39.468 --> 44:40.634
If we let you go, we need to
know

44:40.636 --> 44:42.970
that you're not gonna go blab
about us.

44:42.972 --> 44:46.390
About us living here, about
you coming to this house.

44:46.392 --> 44:49.768
We need you to forget Mark.

44:49.770 --> 44:51.812
Forget that we exist.

44:51.814 --> 44:53.897
We need to become more
than distant memories,

44:53.899 --> 44:57.234
we need to fade completely
away from your mind.

44:57.236 --> 45:00.279
Because if we ever let you go,
Mark

45:00.281 --> 45:03.909
if you ever leave this
house still breathing,

45:05.077 --> 45:09.413
and you ever so much as dream of
us,

45:09.415 --> 45:12.001
you won't like what happens
next.

45:13.878 --> 45:17.590
Ashley probably will, but you
won't.

45:21.677 --> 45:23.802
We can't be
talking about this shit.

45:23.804 --> 45:26.847
Still haven't answered
the question Chris.

45:26.849 --> 45:30.559
I mean, are we a couple? Are we
together?

45:30.561 --> 45:31.435
Yes or no.

45:31.437 --> 45:32.686
Or are you just fucking me?

45:32.688 --> 45:34.855
That doesn't have to
do with any of this.

45:34.857 --> 45:37.274
Keeping secrets from
me, Chris?

45:37.276 --> 45:39.610
What else are you hiding from
me?

45:39.612 --> 45:41.653
What? Are you cheating on me?

45:41.655 --> 45:43.322
You can tell me. I already know.

45:43.324 --> 45:45.034
Seriously, just tell me it's
fine.

45:46.327 --> 45:47.701
I know what you're
trying to do here Ashley.

45:47.703 --> 45:50.037
It's not gonna work this
time. I'm telling you.

45:50.039 --> 45:52.581
I knew it, I fucking knew
you were cheating on me.

45:52.583 --> 45:55.125
Who is it? That little
whore slut Stephanie?

45:55.127 --> 45:56.501
I saw the way that you were
looking at her

45:56.503 --> 45:57.878
at the party last weekend.

45:57.880 --> 45:59.755
Stacy said, "No, he wouldn't do
that."

45:59.757 --> 46:01.048
But I knew you were fucking

46:01.050 --> 46:03.634
- cheating anyways.
- Okay, okay, okay, fine.

46:03.636 --> 46:04.511
You win, okay?

46:05.679 --> 46:07.306
You gave it a good fight,
babe.

46:14.104 --> 46:17.981
Now talk to me, lay it on me
papi.

46:17.983 --> 46:20.859
Okay, but I didn't sleep
with anyone else though, okay?

46:20.861 --> 46:23.111
Duh.

46:23.113 --> 46:24.404
What? Do you think I'm stupid?

46:24.406 --> 46:25.906
Or are you stupid?

46:25.908 --> 46:28.118
I'm just messing with you,
geeze.

46:29.078 --> 46:31.703
Come closer, I don't want
to talk about this shit

46:31.705 --> 46:33.038
in the open, okay?

46:33.040 --> 46:36.375
There aint
nobody in this joint.

46:36.377 --> 46:37.378
All right.

46:38.379 --> 46:40.504
Yes, I did.

46:40.506 --> 46:43.131
But just once okay?

46:43.133 --> 46:45.050
Now, can we please change the
topic?

46:45.052 --> 46:48.971
No we can't change
the topic motherfucker.

46:48.973 --> 46:49.805
Please quiet down.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.517
All right, all right,
fine you little pussy.

46:53.519 --> 46:55.686
But you did it, whatever.

46:55.688 --> 46:56.853
Not a big deal.

46:56.855 --> 46:58.397
Not a big deal?

46:58.399 --> 47:00.484
You're clearly not all there
then Ashley.

47:02.111 --> 47:03.902
I'm not the one who
just confessed to murder

47:03.904 --> 47:06.446
in a fucking public place.

47:06.448 --> 47:07.366
Wow.

47:08.659 --> 47:11.537
So, who was it?

47:12.454 --> 47:14.371
- Can we talk in-
- Chris, come on.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.873
This is called communication.

47:16.875 --> 47:19.626
That's what a relationship's
all about, right?

47:19.628 --> 47:21.628
Hold up, who told you about
this?

47:21.630 --> 47:24.339
I've never even talked
about it with anyone.

47:24.341 --> 47:27.092
A good reporter never
reveals her sources.

47:27.094 --> 47:29.094
You aint even a fucking
reporter though.

47:29.096 --> 47:32.347
Whatever, I
aint snitching on the plug.

47:32.349 --> 47:34.182
A little birdy told me, okay.

47:34.184 --> 47:35.811
It was Steve wasn't
it?

47:36.895 --> 47:37.894
It was.

47:37.896 --> 47:39.438
Maybe.

47:39.440 --> 47:40.772
I fucking knew it, that piece
of shit.

47:40.774 --> 47:43.734
You know, I never even
really told him about it.

47:43.736 --> 47:44.693
I didn't deny it either, but I
mean.

47:44.695 --> 47:49.573
Mhmm, you know, you look good

47:49.575 --> 47:51.950
but you're not very smart.

47:51.952 --> 47:52.786
What?

47:54.079 --> 47:56.749
So, who was it?

47:59.335 --> 48:02.002
My dad.

48:02.004 --> 48:04.338
You killed your fucking dad?

48:04.340 --> 48:05.964
He was scum.

48:05.966 --> 48:07.299
He bit the shit out of me and my
sister.

48:07.301 --> 48:08.717
You know, he didn't even care
about us.

48:08.719 --> 48:12.429
You know, you could beat me all
you want.

48:12.431 --> 48:13.638
I can take that.

48:13.640 --> 48:16.058
But don't touch my fucking
sister.

48:16.060 --> 48:17.059
Fuck.

48:17.061 --> 48:18.560
Yeah, fuck.

48:18.562 --> 48:19.646
So how'd you do it?

48:21.231 --> 48:23.023
I didn't do it on purpose.

48:23.025 --> 48:27.444
But this one time he
was beating on my sister

48:27.446 --> 48:30.280
and I never actually physically
stepped in

48:30.282 --> 48:32.115
but this time, I don't
know what got into me,

48:32.117 --> 48:33.617
maybe I was like, tweaking or
some shit

48:33.619 --> 48:37.412
but I just, I pushed
him as hard as I could.

48:37.414 --> 48:39.247
And my dad, he was a
big motherfucker, okay,

48:39.249 --> 48:40.999
he was like, a big guy.

48:41.001 --> 48:42.626
And I pushed him as hard as I
could

48:42.628 --> 48:45.921
and I punched him and he just
dropped

48:45.923 --> 48:46.797
straight to the ground.

48:46.799 --> 48:49.257
Gone, like just, gone.

48:49.259 --> 48:51.259
And my sister tried to
wake him up and shit

48:51.261 --> 48:55.682
but he was dead.

48:58.310 --> 48:59.601
Shit.

48:59.603 --> 49:00.977
Yeah, shit.

49:00.979 --> 49:03.146
So how'd you get away with it?

49:03.148 --> 49:05.649
It was actually my sister,
she was trying to protect me.

49:05.651 --> 49:08.527
You know, at the time,
I honestly didn't care

49:08.529 --> 49:11.905
if I got arrested or
not, or even got caught.

49:11.907 --> 49:14.950
But my sister, she was upset
yeah,

49:14.952 --> 49:17.661
that my dad was dead,
but she didn't want me

49:17.663 --> 49:19.121
to go to jail either.

49:19.123 --> 49:21.875
So she was like, yeah he's dead

49:23.085 --> 49:27.462
but he was also an alcoholic
and beat us and abused us.

49:27.464 --> 49:31.091
So we dragged his body to the
bathtub,

49:31.093 --> 49:34.012
we sat him in it, ran some warm
water

49:34.972 --> 49:37.264
and framed it as if he
fell and hit his head

49:37.266 --> 49:38.100
in the bathtub.

49:39.893 --> 49:40.725
And it was actually pretty funny

49:40.727 --> 49:41.601
'cause we brought him to the
hospital

49:41.603 --> 49:44.062
a few months before for
the same god damn thing.

49:44.064 --> 49:46.940
- What? No you didn't.
- Yeah, we did.

49:46.942 --> 49:48.483
And then we called the police.

49:48.485 --> 49:49.609
And that shit flew?

49:49.611 --> 49:51.822
Well, I'm sitting here aren't
I?

49:53.073 --> 49:54.656
I want you to kill my mom.

49:54.658 --> 49:55.826
What?

49:56.743 --> 49:57.617
What what?

49:57.619 --> 49:59.619
What do you mean what what?

49:59.621 --> 50:00.704
You just asked me to kill your
mom.

50:00.706 --> 50:01.913
You can't what what me.

50:01.915 --> 50:02.831
Can you do it or no?

50:02.833 --> 50:06.418
You're fucking with me aren't
you?

50:06.420 --> 50:08.545
What's so hard about killing
my mom?

50:08.547 --> 50:10.547
You killed your dad, my
mom should be easier.

50:10.549 --> 50:12.674
Fuck you Ashley, that's
not the point here.

50:12.676 --> 50:14.593
What, you think I'm a
fucking hit man or some shit?

50:14.595 --> 50:15.719
No, I'm not killing your mother.

50:15.721 --> 50:17.888
Oh come on, I'd do it myself

50:17.890 --> 50:20.265
but if I did, my dad would
know for sure it was me.

50:20.267 --> 50:22.767
Forget it Ashley, I aint doing
it.

50:22.769 --> 50:25.854
Well, I don't know
what to tell you Chris.

50:25.856 --> 50:27.856
So what are you gonna do then?

50:27.858 --> 50:28.982
Pay someone else to do it.

50:28.984 --> 50:30.484
What do you mean pay someone
else?

50:30.486 --> 50:32.027
You were gonna pay me to do it?

50:32.029 --> 50:33.570
50 bands.

50:33.572 --> 50:34.821
$50,000?

50:34.823 --> 50:37.866
Aw, you thought just
because you're fucking me

50:37.868 --> 50:39.618
I wouldn't compensate you?

50:39.620 --> 50:41.786
Where the fuck did you get
$50,000?

50:41.788 --> 50:45.499
Let's just call it my
trust fund, college money.

50:45.501 --> 50:47.792
I aint going, so who the fuck
cares?

50:47.794 --> 50:50.003
And you have access to that
shit?

50:50.005 --> 50:52.966
I aint just have access.

50:56.470 --> 50:57.304
I have it.

51:00.599 --> 51:02.432
Fuck, you're just
walking around with this?

51:02.434 --> 51:03.808
Who's gonna fuck with me?

51:03.810 --> 51:05.143
Is this real?

51:05.145 --> 51:06.021
Last I checked.

51:07.314 --> 51:08.897
You're insane.

51:08.899 --> 51:11.358
And now you're repeating
yourself.

51:11.360 --> 51:14.945
Chris, really, it's not that
complicated.

51:14.947 --> 51:18.865
You just wait for her outside,
pull up,

51:18.867 --> 51:20.994
shoot, pow.

51:23.664 --> 51:26.039
And dip, wait in your car,

51:26.041 --> 51:28.375
something discrete, I don't
know.

51:28.377 --> 51:29.709
As long as you peel off

51:29.711 --> 51:31.711
and they can't connect it back
to me,

51:31.713 --> 51:33.505
can't connect it back to you.

51:33.507 --> 51:36.258
And I could do it however?

51:36.260 --> 51:37.676
So you're gonna do it?

51:37.678 --> 51:39.886
I mean, speaking
hypothetically.

51:39.888 --> 51:41.263
Well yeah, no.

51:41.265 --> 51:44.599
The less I know the
better, for the both of us.

51:44.601 --> 51:46.268
I don't know if that's
a good plan Ashley.

51:46.270 --> 51:48.186
I mean, I got away with it once.

51:48.188 --> 51:50.355
You think I can get away with it
again?

51:50.357 --> 51:52.566
Chris, we don't need a plan.

51:52.568 --> 51:55.402
Like, besides my dad,
nobody knows I hate her

51:55.404 --> 51:57.779
and there aint no money
coming to me if she dies

51:57.781 --> 51:59.866
so why would the police think
it's me?

52:01.159 --> 52:03.618
And this could go down
whenever?

52:03.620 --> 52:06.371
Well, not next fucking year

52:06.373 --> 52:07.664
but yeah, whenever.

52:07.666 --> 52:09.708
I don't know, I don't care.

52:09.710 --> 52:13.295
Like, one in three murders
goes completely unsolved

52:13.297 --> 52:17.090
in this country, no obvious
connections.

52:17.092 --> 52:19.718
You really think they're
gonna figure it out?

52:19.720 --> 52:24.097
Do you know how dumb the cops
are in this town?

52:24.099 --> 52:26.683
But you know we're
talking about murder, right?

52:26.685 --> 52:29.477
Like, we're talking about your
mom's life.

52:29.479 --> 52:31.898
We're talking my life here.

52:33.233 --> 52:36.568
Like, fuck though, you can't
come on me.

52:36.570 --> 52:38.612
You want me to come on you?

52:38.614 --> 52:39.654
If I had known you were this
crazy-

52:39.656 --> 52:41.533
- What? You would've fucked me
harder?

52:42.576 --> 52:45.619
Forget it, you're not even
taking this shit seriously.

52:45.621 --> 52:47.495
Find someone else.

52:47.497 --> 52:48.373
Chris.

53:06.391 --> 53:07.893
So we doing this?

53:08.935 --> 53:10.646
Or are you gonna keep pump
faking?

53:18.070 --> 53:22.864
Double, triple, quadruple
check

53:22.866 --> 53:24.783
everything on there.

53:24.785 --> 53:29.164
If as little as a dot on an
I is missing from something

53:32.584 --> 53:35.835
Grace is gonna stick your head
up your ass

53:35.837 --> 53:39.007
faster than a rabbit gets
fucked.

53:40.384 --> 53:42.425
Especially considering
I'm going to check

53:42.427 --> 53:43.343
on the little man right now.

53:43.345 --> 53:45.345
You wanna go right now?

53:45.347 --> 53:47.389
I mean, I don't know about
leaving him alone that long.

53:47.391 --> 53:48.640
It's fine, I can go alone.

53:48.642 --> 53:50.266
You aint going alone Grace.

53:50.268 --> 53:52.852
I mean, this has set
up written all over it.

53:52.854 --> 53:54.270
You walk in that joint,

53:54.272 --> 53:56.398
the next thing you know,
little man's lighting you up

53:56.400 --> 53:57.899
his god damn self.

53:57.901 --> 53:59.901
Fourth of July in December.

53:59.903 --> 54:00.819
Then you come with me

54:00.821 --> 54:02.406
and Ashley can keep him company.

54:03.448 --> 54:05.615
I don't know about leaving her
with him.

54:05.617 --> 54:07.283
Thomas, she'll be fine.

54:07.285 --> 54:09.577
Plus, she needs to start
pulling her weight around here.

54:09.579 --> 54:11.079
The man is tied up.

54:11.081 --> 54:12.163
Just like, tie his other arm

54:12.165 --> 54:14.668
and make sure he's not going
anywhere, she'll be fine.

54:15.794 --> 54:18.294
It's fine
dad, really. She's right.

54:18.296 --> 54:20.797
You sure? You
don't have to do this.

54:20.799 --> 54:22.799
- Whatever.
- I swear dad.

54:22.801 --> 54:25.262
And if anything, I'll just
call y'all on the car phone.

54:26.304 --> 54:27.139
Promise.

54:46.700 --> 54:49.033
We'll be back as soon as we
can.

54:49.035 --> 54:50.368
I would've gone and done this
alone

54:50.370 --> 54:53.037
- but what with-
- But yes, this is my plan

54:53.039 --> 54:55.331
and if you want something done
right.

55:10.474 --> 55:15.393
Aha, little birdy want to
play, huh?

55:29.826 --> 55:31.951
Come on, let's go.

56:46.403 --> 56:49.656
Hey Mark, can I ask you a
question?

56:51.491 --> 56:52.409
Not really, no.

56:55.036 --> 56:57.495
What was your relationship
like with your mom?

56:57.497 --> 56:59.040
What is this? The Oprah show?

57:00.542 --> 57:02.836
I'm sorry, but my mind
is elsewhere right now.

57:04.421 --> 57:05.255
Okay.

57:07.883 --> 57:09.342
What if I were to let you go?

57:11.511 --> 57:12.929
What's your mindset like now?

57:14.764 --> 57:15.847
Let me go?

57:15.849 --> 57:16.683
Mhmm.

57:17.851 --> 57:19.269
And why would you do that?

57:21.313 --> 57:22.105
I'm tired.

57:24.524 --> 57:25.732
I'm tired.

57:25.734 --> 57:27.025
You're tired?

57:27.027 --> 57:28.445
Yeah, I'm tired.

57:29.821 --> 57:32.198
I'm tired of all of it,
I'm tired of everything.

57:33.867 --> 57:35.533
I really don't think
you're gonna go to the cops

57:35.535 --> 57:37.829
and if you do, whatever.

57:38.705 --> 57:40.538
We're all gonna get what's
coming to us anyways

57:40.540 --> 57:41.583
including you.

57:42.834 --> 57:45.712
So yeah, I'm tired.

57:47.047 --> 57:49.714
I mean, what? You want to
stay here and get killed?

57:49.716 --> 57:50.759
I mean, I don't mind.

57:52.093 --> 57:53.051
What do you want?

57:53.053 --> 57:54.636
Okay, first of all,

57:54.638 --> 57:56.346
can you at least try and be
nice?

57:56.348 --> 57:57.513
I mean, I'm being nice here.

57:57.515 --> 58:00.350
You got me tied up to
a chair all fucked up.

58:00.352 --> 58:01.726
How is that nice to you?

58:01.728 --> 58:02.602
You're the one who broke in
here.

58:02.604 --> 58:04.562
And you were the one that
was about to come down here

58:04.564 --> 58:06.981
and torture me about 20 minutes
ago.

58:06.983 --> 58:07.817
Oh yeah.

58:08.902 --> 58:11.569
Oh and by the way, full
disclosure.

58:11.571 --> 58:12.862
I'm the one that stabbed you.

58:12.864 --> 58:14.948
- What?
- What?

58:14.950 --> 58:17.951
What did you think that this
was some sort of plot twist?

58:17.953 --> 58:20.747
Some conspiracy about how you
got stabbed?

58:21.581 --> 58:24.040
Nope, you were out

58:24.042 --> 58:28.544
and I was bored, so I stuck this
in you.

58:28.546 --> 58:30.588
You're fucking sick.

58:30.590 --> 58:32.217
Okay, let's just call it even.

58:34.427 --> 58:36.594
And how is this even close to
even?

58:36.596 --> 58:39.140
Enough with all the questions,
Mark.

58:40.475 --> 58:42.225
I stabbed you, I fucking stabbed
you

58:42.227 --> 58:43.645
and that's payback.

58:46.606 --> 58:48.441
So you want to get out of here
or no?

58:50.110 --> 58:53.279
So play nice and tell me about
your mom.

58:55.448 --> 58:56.280
She was all right.

58:56.282 --> 58:57.782
What do you mean, all right?

58:57.784 --> 59:00.868
I don't know, she was a normal
mother.

59:00.870 --> 59:02.745
I don't know what you
expect me to tell you.

59:02.747 --> 59:05.289
The truth, that's it.

59:05.291 --> 59:07.000
Unless you want to wait
for my parents to come back

59:07.002 --> 59:09.170
'cause that's happening real
soon.

59:11.506 --> 59:12.714
Ashamed.

59:12.716 --> 59:14.090
Ashamed?

59:14.092 --> 59:16.175
Bitch please, whatchu mean I'm
ashamed fo?

59:16.177 --> 59:17.012
No.

59:19.139 --> 59:19.973
My mom.

59:22.767 --> 59:24.267
That was the first thing
that came to my mind

59:24.269 --> 59:25.353
when I thought of her.

59:28.898 --> 59:29.733
Ashamed of me.

59:31.860 --> 59:33.403
Now we're talking.

59:34.696 --> 59:35.530
Whatchu mean?

59:37.866 --> 59:39.242
My mom raised me alone.

59:41.036 --> 59:42.746
She did her best, she really
did.

59:44.581 --> 59:45.999
I never got what you had.

59:47.167 --> 59:48.750
In the projects working two jobs

59:48.752 --> 59:50.251
just to keep the lights on

59:50.253 --> 59:52.213
and me running the streets at
her back.

59:54.257 --> 59:55.216
Know that rap song?

59:56.885 --> 59:59.218
Just this one doesn't
have me drinking champaign

59:59.220 --> 1:00:00.055
when I'm thirsty.

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:03.266
Nice B.I.G reference.

1:00:05.393 --> 1:00:06.227
I don't know.

1:00:08.063 --> 1:00:10.106
I know all this shit sounds like
a cliche

1:00:11.483 --> 1:00:12.982
but that's the one thing about
cliches,

1:00:12.984 --> 1:00:14.611
they're often close to the
truth.

1:00:16.571 --> 1:00:18.406
It took me a long time to
understand.

1:00:20.492 --> 1:00:22.243
Took me a long time just to get
it.

1:00:23.620 --> 1:00:27.205
Like to understand where she
got that motivation from,

1:00:27.207 --> 1:00:29.959
where she got all that energy
to do everything she did.

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:35.381
And it was all for me.

1:00:36.508 --> 1:00:38.299
And still to this day,
I haven't even been able

1:00:38.301 --> 1:00:39.302
to thank her for it.

1:00:40.845 --> 1:00:43.348
All she ever wanted for
me was something better.

1:00:45.809 --> 1:00:47.477
For me to be a better person.

1:00:49.604 --> 1:00:51.231
Fast forward, now I aint shit.

1:00:53.233 --> 1:00:55.316
And even if you were to
compare the two of us,

1:00:55.318 --> 1:00:56.277
I'm even less.

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:00.031
So yeah.

1:01:02.325 --> 1:01:03.576
Where is she now?

1:01:06.037 --> 1:01:06.871
Not sure.

1:01:09.165 --> 1:01:10.750
She could be gone, I don't know.

1:01:14.045 --> 1:01:15.964
But if she could see me now,
shame.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:20.508
That's what she'd feel for me

1:01:20.510 --> 1:01:22.470
and that's already more than I
deserve.

1:01:26.474 --> 1:01:28.933
I wish I had a mom who cared
that much.

1:01:33.481 --> 1:01:34.814
Are you serious right now?

1:01:34.816 --> 1:01:36.357
Yeah, I'm fucking serious.

1:01:36.359 --> 1:01:37.525
Do you see the way she talks to
me?

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:39.068
And that's on a good day.

1:01:39.070 --> 1:01:40.444
This is a good day?

1:01:40.446 --> 1:01:41.614
I've seen worse.

1:01:43.032 --> 1:01:45.783
Wow, whatever.

1:01:45.785 --> 1:01:46.909
You're really gonna buy this
whole act

1:01:46.911 --> 1:01:47.743
your mom's putting on?

1:01:47.745 --> 1:01:50.663
It's not an act, it's true,
trust me.

1:01:50.665 --> 1:01:51.624
It's bullshit.

1:01:52.959 --> 1:01:54.709
Are you really gonna buy this
whole

1:01:54.711 --> 1:01:56.711
I hate my daughter act?

1:01:56.713 --> 1:01:58.921
Yeah I buy it, 'cause it's
fucking true.

1:01:58.923 --> 1:01:59.966
It's bullshit.

1:02:01.009 --> 1:02:02.300
If you weren't so focused on
yourself

1:02:02.302 --> 1:02:03.136
you'd see it too.

1:02:04.304 --> 1:02:05.680
Enlighten me then.

1:02:09.225 --> 1:02:11.934
I just think if parents
didn't care about their kids

1:02:11.936 --> 1:02:13.188
they just wouldn't care.

1:02:14.647 --> 1:02:16.522
And if your mom really did hate
you

1:02:16.524 --> 1:02:19.027
she wouldn't be riding you
this hard all the time.

1:02:20.653 --> 1:02:22.780
Some people just don't
know how to show it.

1:02:24.199 --> 1:02:26.157
You think you had a fucked up
life?

1:02:26.159 --> 1:02:27.283
Did you ever think for once

1:02:27.285 --> 1:02:28.784
maybe your mom had it worse

1:02:28.786 --> 1:02:31.289
and maybe that's the reason
why she is who she is?

1:02:32.957 --> 1:02:36.626
Like I said, some people
don't know how to show it

1:02:36.628 --> 1:02:38.588
but it doesn't mean they don't
feel it.

1:02:40.465 --> 1:02:43.009
And like that, I think you
two have that in common.

1:02:44.344 --> 1:02:45.178
Just saying.

1:02:56.773 --> 1:02:58.147
Who is it?

1:02:58.149 --> 1:03:01.025
Good evening,
I just wanted to warn you

1:03:01.027 --> 1:03:04.028
that you and your husband
are going to die tonight.

1:03:04.030 --> 1:03:07.823
It's kinda tragic, but there's
nothing you can do about it.

1:03:07.825 --> 1:03:08.993
We will kill you.

1:03:11.162 --> 1:03:14.413
You have about 30 seconds
before the fun starts.

1:03:14.415 --> 1:03:15.665
We thought we'd give you a heads
up

1:03:15.667 --> 1:03:18.292
because we like to play fair.

1:03:18.294 --> 1:03:20.129
- Grace?
- So grab a knife,

1:03:21.005 --> 1:03:22.255
or a baseball bat

1:03:22.257 --> 1:03:25.466
or whatever makeshift weapon you
can find

1:03:25.468 --> 1:03:29.681
and just so you know,
there's also a very bad man

1:03:30.848 --> 1:03:33.057
- waiting at the back door.
- Grace what's up?

1:03:33.059 --> 1:03:33.891
- Who is it?
- Thomas listen.

1:03:33.893 --> 1:03:35.351
Please, we need to run.

1:03:35.353 --> 1:03:36.310
No, what's going on Grace?

1:03:36.312 --> 1:03:37.728
She said she was gonna kill
us.

1:03:37.730 --> 1:03:40.606
What are you talking about?

1:07:01.601 --> 1:07:03.603
They gave me a simple
choice.

1:07:04.979 --> 1:07:08.483
Either kill my mom or
they'll kill us both.

1:07:10.067 --> 1:07:11.360
I was 10 years old.

1:07:12.653 --> 1:07:14.570
When they saw me hesitating,

1:07:14.572 --> 1:07:16.447
they told me what happened to my
father.

1:07:16.449 --> 1:07:17.533
She killed your dad, she shot
him.

1:07:18.367 --> 1:07:21.160
That they weren't
the one that killed him.

1:07:21.162 --> 1:07:22.411
That my mom...

1:07:22.413 --> 1:07:24.663
Oh my god, don't do
this.

1:07:24.665 --> 1:07:25.831
Strong.

1:07:35.259 --> 1:07:36.884
I love you so much-

1:07:44.852 --> 1:07:46.687
So you expect
me to believe this shit?

1:07:47.688 --> 1:07:48.896
They shot your dad

1:07:48.898 --> 1:07:51.734
and then you got adopted by
your real parent's killers?

1:07:52.985 --> 1:07:55.653
You might be fucked, but
you'd be even more fucked

1:07:55.655 --> 1:07:57.571
if that actually happened.

1:07:57.573 --> 1:07:59.156
I guess it's too
early for you to realize

1:07:59.158 --> 1:08:01.075
how actually fucked I am.

1:08:01.077 --> 1:08:04.245
I mean, did you listen
to anything I just said.

1:08:04.247 --> 1:08:07.414
If you really look at it, they
didn't actually kill anybody.

1:08:07.416 --> 1:08:08.251
This time.

1:08:09.794 --> 1:08:12.002
My real mom and I did all the
work.

1:08:12.004 --> 1:08:13.379
It's not that
fucking easy to kill people

1:08:13.381 --> 1:08:15.506
and take their identities.

1:08:15.508 --> 1:08:18.801
Like, what happened to the
bodies?

1:08:18.803 --> 1:08:20.803
Did these people not
have family or friends?

1:08:20.805 --> 1:08:22.012
People leave paper trails.

1:08:22.014 --> 1:08:24.640
Other people ask questions.

1:08:24.642 --> 1:08:26.602
They knew what they were
fucking doing.

1:08:28.145 --> 1:08:29.395
They chose people they thought

1:08:29.397 --> 1:08:30.773
wouldn't be missed too much.

1:08:32.316 --> 1:08:33.607
The real Thomas and the real
Grace

1:08:33.609 --> 1:08:34.984
grew up in foster homes.

1:08:34.986 --> 1:08:38.153
And after I shot my mom,
they burned the bodies

1:08:38.155 --> 1:08:40.866
and here we are.

1:08:43.953 --> 1:08:44.994
Anyways, I don't really give a
fuck

1:08:44.996 --> 1:08:46.453
if you believe me or not.

1:08:46.455 --> 1:08:48.414
A deal's a deal, right?

1:08:48.416 --> 1:08:49.331
What are you doing?

1:08:49.333 --> 1:08:51.375
Think I'm a liar?

1:08:51.377 --> 1:08:53.752
They're probably on
their way back here now.

1:08:53.754 --> 1:08:55.129
If I were you, I'd get your son

1:08:55.131 --> 1:08:56.839
and I'd get the hell out of
state.

1:08:56.841 --> 1:08:58.426
Or even better, out of country.

1:08:59.844 --> 1:09:01.844
Okay, can I have my wallet
back please?

1:09:01.846 --> 1:09:03.472
I think it's under the chair.

1:09:05.558 --> 1:09:06.392
Sure.

1:09:21.991 --> 1:09:23.616
What are you doing?

1:09:23.618 --> 1:09:24.952
Can you undo these please?

1:09:28.581 --> 1:09:30.581
You know there's a few
things you can't finesse

1:09:30.583 --> 1:09:31.542
a teenager on.

1:09:33.127 --> 1:09:35.254
You can fool us about a lot of
things.

1:09:37.131 --> 1:09:39.006
But there's a few things a
teenage girl

1:09:39.008 --> 1:09:43.304
knows more about than almost
anyone.

1:09:49.018 --> 1:09:50.603
You know what those things are?

1:09:52.855 --> 1:09:53.773
Fake ID's.

1:09:56.150 --> 1:09:59.610
David Cook, Joey Montichollo,

1:09:59.612 --> 1:10:01.155
Jocyln Gardnell.

1:10:09.413 --> 1:10:11.082
Do you even know who this kid
is?

1:10:16.963 --> 1:10:19.546
Maybe trust a murderer

1:10:19.548 --> 1:10:21.968
but never trust a thief.

1:10:57.253 --> 1:10:58.337
What are you doing?

1:10:59.171 --> 1:11:00.003
Please!

1:11:00.005 --> 1:11:00.838
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please.

1:11:00.840 --> 1:11:02.548
I promise, please, please,
please

1:11:02.550 --> 1:11:04.383
I'm so sorry, please, please.

1:11:04.385 --> 1:11:06.135
Told you I
don't like fucking liars.

1:11:06.137 --> 1:11:07.636
Please, please, please,
please, please.

1:11:13.477 --> 1:11:15.602
You were so close, Mark.

1:11:15.604 --> 1:11:19.150
So fucking close you
could probably taste it.

1:11:20.860 --> 1:11:22.027
I'd feel bad for you

1:11:23.529 --> 1:11:25.656
but I see a good side to this.

1:11:27.950 --> 1:11:30.119
We can finally have some fun.

1:11:32.413 --> 1:11:33.871
Please.

1:11:33.873 --> 1:11:35.332
You really are a pussy.

1:11:38.419 --> 1:11:43.130
So tell me, if the whole
son story was all bullshit

1:11:43.132 --> 1:11:45.340
then why'd you break in here?

1:11:45.342 --> 1:11:46.258
Drugs.

1:11:46.260 --> 1:11:48.177
Speak up bitch.

1:11:48.179 --> 1:11:49.678
Drugs.

1:11:49.680 --> 1:11:50.512
To pay for drugs.

1:11:50.514 --> 1:11:52.806
All right, we're done talking
now.

1:11:52.808 --> 1:11:56.103
Well, you're done talking now.

1:11:58.147 --> 1:12:00.983
I'ma do whatever the fuck I damn
want.

1:12:03.110 --> 1:12:04.070
I have an idea.

1:12:05.488 --> 1:12:07.198
I think you're gonna like it
Mark.

1:12:09.075 --> 1:12:10.616
Where are you going?

1:12:10.618 --> 1:12:14.371
Where are you going?

1:12:15.706 --> 1:12:19.627
Mark, did you just
choke on your own blood?

1:12:28.135 --> 1:12:30.636
I'ma save this for later.

1:13:18.936 --> 1:13:19.770
What?

1:13:21.105 --> 1:13:23.564
What? What was that?

1:13:23.566 --> 1:13:24.900
I can't hear you, what?

1:13:27.528 --> 1:13:30.865
Oh, you made me really mad,
Mark.

1:13:33.367 --> 1:13:38.203
Oh yeah, that's not even your
actual name.

1:13:38.205 --> 1:13:42.207
It's okay, I'll
keep calling you that

1:13:42.209 --> 1:13:43.752
if you don't mind.

1:13:46.839 --> 1:13:47.673
It's funny.

1:13:50.926 --> 1:13:52.928
I don't even know your real name
and yet

1:13:54.597 --> 1:13:56.348
I still feel kinda close to you.

1:13:59.184 --> 1:14:01.896
Funny how we use names

1:14:03.188 --> 1:14:05.024
to describe things.

1:14:06.483 --> 1:14:11.028
When really, those names have
nothing

1:14:11.030 --> 1:14:12.239
to do with those things.

1:14:15.034 --> 1:14:15.868
For example.

1:14:19.204 --> 1:14:21.373
You obviously know this
is a hammer, right?

1:14:23.125 --> 1:14:26.418
But the part of the hammer
that I used to hit you

1:14:26.420 --> 1:14:29.254
is called the face of the
hammer.

1:14:29.256 --> 1:14:32.633
And I hit you in the face.

1:14:34.803 --> 1:14:37.598
What? I still can't hear you
Mark.

1:14:39.767 --> 1:14:41.936
I wish I could, but I can't.

1:14:42.770 --> 1:14:45.771
Anyways, what was I saying?

1:14:45.773 --> 1:14:49.524
Oh yes, the face of the hammer.

1:14:49.526 --> 1:14:51.195
So this is the face,

1:14:52.154 --> 1:14:54.238
let's go a little deeper.

1:14:54.240 --> 1:14:55.989
Do you know what this part is
called?

1:14:58.369 --> 1:15:02.331
Mark, you're not even trying to
play.

1:15:03.832 --> 1:15:07.209
I'm really disappointed in
your lack of participation.

1:15:07.211 --> 1:15:08.545
It's called the cheek.

1:15:12.716 --> 1:15:15.219
No one can hear you Mark.

1:15:16.136 --> 1:15:21.264
Sound is really isolated
here, kinda freaky.

1:15:21.266 --> 1:15:25.310
Look, I'll even scream with you,
okay?

1:15:25.312 --> 1:15:26.897
Help, help! Somebody please
help!

1:15:30.651 --> 1:15:31.485
Hmm, yeah.

1:15:41.203 --> 1:15:43.622
Nobody's coming Mark.

1:15:45.207 --> 1:15:46.333
Now where was I?

1:15:48.919 --> 1:15:50.627
Oh yeah, the cheek.

1:16:16.822 --> 1:16:18.490
Oh shit, fun's over.

1:16:30.753 --> 1:16:33.128
What the fuck happened in my
house?

1:16:33.130 --> 1:16:35.505
We gotta clean this shit up
and quick.

1:16:35.507 --> 1:16:38.383
This is getting messy,
real fucking sloppy.

1:16:38.385 --> 1:16:40.260
Thomas, we are not
killing him in my house.

1:16:40.262 --> 1:16:41.263
We live here.

1:16:42.222 --> 1:16:43.555
I thought we were done with all
this

1:16:43.557 --> 1:16:45.724
and now it's starting all over
again.

1:16:45.726 --> 1:16:47.350
Thomas, untie him, we need to
get him

1:16:47.352 --> 1:16:48.769
into the car right now.

1:16:48.771 --> 1:16:50.937
- The sun is coming up.
- Okay.

1:16:50.939 --> 1:16:52.731
Dragging a
bloody man from your house

1:16:52.733 --> 1:16:54.107
into your car isn't the most
discrete thing in the world.

1:16:54.109 --> 1:16:55.817
We need to get rid of him quick.

1:16:55.819 --> 1:16:56.693
I'll put on my
jacket.

1:16:56.695 --> 1:16:57.778
Ashley, you're not coming.

1:16:57.780 --> 1:17:00.363
You've enough for one night,
we'll talk in the morning.

1:17:00.365 --> 1:17:02.282
Mom, please, you might need my
help.

1:17:02.284 --> 1:17:03.658
We're just gonna take him to
the lake,

1:17:03.660 --> 1:17:06.411
do what we gotta do, nothing
we haven't done before.

1:17:06.413 --> 1:17:07.748
We'll be fine.

1:17:11.085 --> 1:17:12.417
Thomas, I'm gonna get the car
ready.

1:17:12.419 --> 1:17:15.128
Mom, can I just talk
to you for second please?

1:17:15.130 --> 1:17:17.339
I'm sorry I didn't tell
you that he was lying.

1:17:17.341 --> 1:17:18.924
You should have called us.

1:17:18.926 --> 1:17:19.925
We're in a rush, but listen.

1:17:19.927 --> 1:17:21.051
It could've been a trap,
instead you do this

1:17:21.053 --> 1:17:23.553
and now we're cleaning up your
mess again.

1:17:23.555 --> 1:17:24.429
I'm sorry, I didn't know.

1:17:24.431 --> 1:17:27.432
Look Ash, we have to do this
now.

1:17:27.434 --> 1:17:30.771
But if you want, we can talk
as soon as I come back, okay?

1:17:49.957 --> 1:17:52.124
You better not have any stupid
ideas

1:17:52.126 --> 1:17:54.042
going through your head.

1:17:54.044 --> 1:17:57.629
When we get outside, you
so much as look at someone

1:17:57.631 --> 1:17:59.965
the wrong way, I will slice your
ear,

1:17:59.967 --> 1:18:02.261
oh for fucks sake.

1:18:03.554 --> 1:18:06.473
What the fuck is it now? For
god's sake.

1:18:08.058 --> 1:18:08.892
For fucks sake you ugly
motherfucker,

1:18:11.311 --> 1:18:14.022
get the fuck up, the fuck
is wrong with.

1:19:46.865 --> 1:19:47.697
Go!

1:19:56.208 --> 1:19:57.209
Stay here.

1:20:08.262 --> 1:20:11.098
Merry Christmas you mother
fucker.
