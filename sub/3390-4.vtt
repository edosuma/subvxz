WEBVTT

00:52.300 --> 00:54.133
Hyun-jun, an elite agent
of the special task force,

00:54.500 --> 00:57.266
meets Seung-hee at school
and falls in love with her.

00:57.766 --> 01:00.833
Sa-woo meets Seung-hee with Sang-hyun,
his friend from hometown

01:01.200 --> 01:02.700
and also falls for her.

01:03.300 --> 01:05.433
One day, Hyun-jun and Sa-woo are taken
to somewhere

01:05.500 --> 01:08.366
by mysterious guys
and undergo harsh tests.

01:08.700 --> 01:11.100
They receive special training sessions
and join the NSS.

01:11.733 --> 01:13.433
They both do not know

01:13.500 --> 01:15.800
that the woman they fell in love with is
the same person,

01:16.166 --> 01:19.266
and they meet Seung-hee
on their first day at the NSS.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.066
Hyun-jun and Sa-woo

01:21.133 --> 01:25.466
find out that everything had been planned
and feel offended,

01:25.533 --> 01:27.466
but they fail to get rid
of their feelings for her.

01:27.800 --> 01:34.500
Hyun-jun suddenly kisses Seung-hee,
and they start dating secretly.

01:34.633 --> 01:38.333
Hyun-jun and Sa-woo succeed
in their first mission

01:38.466 --> 01:42.666
and Hyun-jun and Seung-hee
go on a trip to Akita together.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.966
Meanwhile, Sa-woo is sent on a mission
to help Seung-ryong Hong,

01:46.066 --> 01:49.066
a North Korean nuclear physicist,
defect to South Korea.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.700
EPISODE 4

03:07.633 --> 03:09.200
Who are you?

03:12.666 --> 03:13.933
What?

03:14.400 --> 03:15.533
You know what I want.

03:16.866 --> 03:17.966
Give it to me.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.333
Why are you doing this to me?
What are you asking for?

04:33.066 --> 04:33.966
What is that?

04:35.200 --> 04:36.833
Nothing.

04:43.866 --> 04:45.200
What do you mean you failed it?

04:45.866 --> 04:51.500
Seung-ryong Hong and three of our agents
who were sent to escort him are all dead.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.500
Is North Korea responsible for this?

04:58.033 --> 04:59.133
We're trying to figure it out.

04:59.433 --> 05:01.966
Is there any possibility
that the North found out

05:02.333 --> 05:04.100
that we granted him asylum?

05:04.166 --> 05:07.033
So far, the North hasn't shown
any reaction.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.733
It's regretful
that we've lost a great chance

05:09.900 --> 05:12.200
to grasp the current status
of the North's nuclear development.

05:13.933 --> 05:17.700
Please settle the situation quickly
so it doesn't cause any further trouble.

05:17.866 --> 05:18.733
Yes, sir.

05:23.666 --> 05:24.833
Where is Seung-hee Choi?

05:25.266 --> 05:28.666
She's waiting in Balaton to be ordered
home with Hyun-jun and Sa-woo.

05:29.033 --> 05:30.933
-Should I call them?
-Let her be.

06:06.533 --> 06:07.533
What is it called again?

06:08.566 --> 06:09.533
Goulash.

06:09.733 --> 06:11.566
-Is it good?
-Yes.

06:12.033 --> 06:12.933
Do you want to try some?

06:17.666 --> 06:19.233
How unsophisticated you are.

06:20.600 --> 06:23.733
You brat, don't you have to
get used to her taste?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.033
I'd rather give up on her
if she forces me to change my taste.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.333
You want more?

06:38.400 --> 06:39.666
It's for you.

06:49.600 --> 06:50.500
Hello.

06:55.066 --> 06:56.066
All right, sir.

06:58.533 --> 06:59.566
Who is it?

06:59.633 --> 07:00.600
I'm have a mission.

07:01.266 --> 07:02.300
What mission?

07:04.833 --> 07:06.366
I don't know. He just said where to go.

07:41.800 --> 07:42.966
Why are you so startled?

07:45.666 --> 07:48.033
I didn't know you'd come here.

07:50.700 --> 07:52.466
Seung-ryong Hong is dead.

07:53.433 --> 07:55.966
All our agents were also found dead.

07:56.766 --> 07:58.933
From what we've gathered so far,

07:59.300 --> 08:01.333
it seems to be the retaliation
of the North.

08:05.000 --> 08:06.033
Let's take a walk.

08:11.700 --> 08:12.666
Have you heard

08:13.000 --> 08:15.100
about Pan-European Picnic?

08:16.200 --> 08:17.800
In 1989,

08:19.166 --> 08:20.933
Hungary, a then-communist country,

08:21.800 --> 08:23.566
opened its borders

08:23.766 --> 08:25.466
to exile thousands of East Germans

08:25.533 --> 08:27.833
to West Germany.

08:29.333 --> 08:30.466
This led to

08:31.100 --> 08:33.299
the fall of the Berlin Wall,

08:34.366 --> 08:36.466
and to the end of the Cold War.

08:40.400 --> 08:41.466
You have

08:42.066 --> 08:43.633
a solo mission.

08:46.366 --> 08:48.266
Just like Hungary played a pivotal role

08:48.833 --> 08:51.866
in the reunification of Germany,
you'll be able to play the same role

08:52.500 --> 08:56.233
in reunifying the Korean Peninsula
if you succeed in your mission.

09:12.533 --> 09:14.500
Can I ask you something?

09:15.533 --> 09:16.966
Sure. What is it?

09:19.500 --> 09:21.933
Since when did you and Hyun-jun
become close?

09:22.533 --> 09:24.266
I didn't notice it at all.

09:26.500 --> 09:27.666
I think

09:28.300 --> 09:30.466
we had a good feeling
toward each other from the beginning.

09:32.166 --> 09:33.966
We've become serious

09:34.866 --> 09:36.966
since we visited
the deputy director's house

09:38.033 --> 09:40.300
on Hyun-jun's first day at the NSS. We--

09:41.033 --> 09:42.466
We had our first kiss on that night.

09:47.166 --> 09:48.200
What mission is it?

09:50.000 --> 09:51.300
It's a solo mission.

09:53.800 --> 09:54.633
What about us?

09:56.566 --> 09:58.166
He said you can just enjoy your vacation.

10:02.633 --> 10:04.733
I don't have much time left
to spend with Seung-hee.

10:08.033 --> 10:09.400
Aren't you busy?

10:13.266 --> 10:14.600
Fine, dude.

10:17.900 --> 10:18.766
Ouch.

10:25.633 --> 10:27.000
Why does it have to be a solo mission?

10:28.400 --> 10:29.566
It's an easy one.

10:48.933 --> 10:49.933
Isn't this so pretty?

10:50.300 --> 10:51.233
I like this one, too.

10:51.900 --> 10:52.833
This one?

10:54.633 --> 10:55.833
Its design is very unique.

10:56.866 --> 10:58.033
How did they make it?

10:58.400 --> 10:59.266
Let's go.

11:04.233 --> 11:05.800
It's a tarot card reading.

11:06.033 --> 11:06.866
Why not?

11:07.100 --> 11:08.033
Try it.

11:08.366 --> 11:10.733
No. If the reading isn't favorable,
it'll only hurt my feeling.

11:10.866 --> 11:12.666
You don't have to believe it.
Let me try, then.

11:14.300 --> 11:15.166
Well...

11:36.866 --> 11:38.266
So we're destined to be together.

11:49.666 --> 11:50.666
Let's go.

12:23.700 --> 12:25.400
We've become serious

12:26.366 --> 12:28.433
since we visited
the deputy director's house

12:29.533 --> 12:31.666
on Hyun-jun's first day at the NSS. We...

12:32.466 --> 12:33.966
We had our first kiss on that night.

12:53.066 --> 12:54.433
Hey, hey.

12:54.533 --> 12:55.633
I'm sorry.

12:55.700 --> 12:56.700
It's okay.

13:19.766 --> 13:21.100
Are you leaving early in the morning?

13:22.666 --> 13:23.500
Yes.

13:28.266 --> 13:29.166
Why?

13:32.000 --> 13:35.633
You know what?
You've been nervous all day long.

13:36.100 --> 13:38.066
No, I haven't.

13:40.633 --> 13:43.133
Don't worry about me. I'll come back soon.

13:45.366 --> 13:46.533
Please take care.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.666
I will.

13:51.000 --> 13:51.933
Good night.

13:54.200 --> 13:55.100
Good night.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.300
Hyun-jun.

15:09.066 --> 15:10.066
You didn't sleep?

15:11.600 --> 15:12.700
Oh, you got up early.

15:13.200 --> 15:14.033
Yes.

15:23.833 --> 15:24.966
What is the mission about?

15:37.166 --> 15:38.000
EX.

15:49.733 --> 15:50.766
Who's the target?

15:56.833 --> 15:58.400
Deputy Director is here in Hungary now.

16:00.066 --> 16:01.566
Go ask him if you want to know.

16:03.600 --> 16:04.633
Gosh.

16:18.700 --> 16:19.666
Sa-woo.

16:22.366 --> 16:23.266
Yes.

16:25.066 --> 16:26.266
If something goes wrong with me--

16:26.333 --> 16:27.366
Stop that bullshit.

16:31.866 --> 16:33.733
Why are you so nervous today?

16:35.366 --> 16:37.200
I heard that a lot today.

16:38.166 --> 16:39.900
You know I never get nervous.

16:40.433 --> 16:41.633
Get me a cup of coffee.

16:42.133 --> 16:43.333
I'll go take a shower.

16:43.766 --> 16:44.733
Okay.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.000
Who is the assassination target?

17:36.433 --> 17:37.533
It's Seong-cheol Yun.

17:38.500 --> 17:41.433
The President of the Supreme
People's Assembly Presidium?

17:43.633 --> 17:44.533
Right.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.133
I'm not sure if I'm allowed to ask this,

17:49.400 --> 17:50.500
but what's the reason?

17:52.100 --> 17:53.433
ICBM.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.433
North Korea has been

17:56.833 --> 18:00.533
developing projectile technologies rapidly
up until now.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.166
Now they're just an inch away

18:03.666 --> 18:07.000
from finishing a missile that's capable
of attacking the U.S. directly.

18:07.900 --> 18:10.966
The last step left is
nuclear warhead miniaturization.

18:12.833 --> 18:13.966
To realize it,

18:14.033 --> 18:16.700
Seong-cheol Yun will have a secret meeting
with the officials

18:16.966 --> 18:19.866
from the former Soviet Union countries
here in Hungary.

18:21.633 --> 18:22.666
We can't just sit back

18:23.833 --> 18:28.300
and watch the North become
a nuclear power.

20:27.000 --> 20:29.100
The total number of the agents
from the Supreme Guard

20:29.166 --> 20:30.766
in Budapest now is 20 including me.

20:30.933 --> 20:33.033
The NBH and the Hungarian police
are coordinating with us,

20:33.133 --> 20:34.833
and 15 guards of the Bureau One

20:34.900 --> 20:36.666
will also fly here by the plane

20:36.733 --> 20:37.933
that will depart from Pyeongyang.

20:40.666 --> 20:43.133
Now, the guard level is upgraded
to the first level.

20:45.366 --> 20:46.400
What happened?

20:48.133 --> 20:50.500
We got intelligence that there will be
an assassination attempt.

22:37.233 --> 22:38.400
What do we do now?

22:39.766 --> 22:40.600
Well...

22:42.066 --> 22:44.100
We should meet Deputy Director first.

22:45.266 --> 22:46.766
Is he here?

22:48.833 --> 22:50.966
Yes. I heard it from Hyun-jun.

22:54.133 --> 22:55.066
Then,

22:55.133 --> 22:58.666
is Hyun-jun's solo mission
assigned directly from Deputy Director?

23:00.633 --> 23:01.466
Yes.

24:16.600 --> 24:18.966
Give me a report on the situation
of the square every two hours.

24:19.033 --> 24:19.866
Yes, sir.

24:20.800 --> 24:21.766
Where are the snipers?

24:22.266 --> 24:23.166
I've placed them

24:23.233 --> 24:25.833
in a triangular position, so their ranges
are overlapped by one another.

24:51.933 --> 24:52.833
What about that building?

24:53.833 --> 24:55.966
We will completely close the building.

25:24.866 --> 25:26.666
Personal information
and identities of the staff?

25:26.800 --> 25:27.666
All checked.

25:28.100 --> 25:31.433
I even went through those
who'd been here during the last 15 days.

25:31.700 --> 25:33.866
You must keep track of movements
of agents from South Korea.

25:33.933 --> 25:34.800
Yes, sir.

25:35.200 --> 25:38.633
See if we can jam satellite transmissions
between South Korea and the U.S. that day.

25:38.700 --> 25:39.600
Yes, sir.

25:57.800 --> 25:59.233
Place a sniper here, too.

26:00.766 --> 26:01.666
Yes, sir.

26:04.900 --> 26:05.966
GUARD OF ORDER POLICE

27:17.666 --> 27:18.566
Hello.

27:27.966 --> 27:30.733
They heightened the security by placing
the Hungarian intelligence agents.

27:31.433 --> 27:34.266
And the North Korean agents are already
placed in positions.

27:35.866 --> 27:36.800
I got it.

27:37.200 --> 27:38.200
I'll call you again.

27:45.533 --> 27:47.366
Is there something wrong?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.166
It's nothing.

27:54.233 --> 27:56.066
What's TK1's solo mission?

27:58.566 --> 28:00.400
Do we have to back him up?

28:02.333 --> 28:03.366
Sir.

28:03.900 --> 28:05.300
Just wait a little while.

28:06.233 --> 28:07.633
Consider this a vacation

28:08.133 --> 28:09.366
and have some rest.

28:34.033 --> 28:34.866
Yes.

28:35.700 --> 28:37.466
The plan will never be changed.

28:37.566 --> 28:38.600
Finish it.

28:40.266 --> 28:41.300
Yes, sir.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.566
I'm afraid
that something might have gone wrong.

28:56.700 --> 28:59.233
We've been on standby for two days,
without a clue about the mission.

28:59.566 --> 29:01.566
Do you have any idea
about Hyun-jun's mission?

29:02.966 --> 29:03.966
Don't worry.

29:04.466 --> 29:05.566
He'll make it.

29:41.766 --> 29:42.766
What is she saying?

29:44.100 --> 29:45.566
It's nothing special.

30:37.166 --> 30:38.433
What can I bring for you?

31:50.233 --> 31:51.300
Why don't you have some?

31:51.766 --> 31:52.733
It's okay.

31:59.400 --> 32:00.866
Have you heard of something called  khleb ?

32:04.133 --> 32:06.266
It's Russian black bread.

32:08.033 --> 32:10.100
When I was studying in Moscow
at the age of 22,

32:10.933 --> 32:14.133
I barely lived off that tasteless
and hard bread for a month.

32:15.266 --> 32:18.166
On the freezing winter nights in Moscow,

32:20.433 --> 32:22.133
I was shivering

32:23.233 --> 32:24.666
in my room without a heater.

32:27.500 --> 32:30.500
I thought the Korean reunification
was around the corner.

32:35.300 --> 32:36.966
That's what kept me going.

35:35.300 --> 35:36.266
I got it.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.366
Situation report.

35:58.800 --> 35:59.966
Ready.

36:00.300 --> 36:01.333
Ready.

36:02.166 --> 36:03.166
Ready.

36:04.433 --> 36:05.533
Ready.

36:21.266 --> 36:22.333
One minute to operation.

36:31.666 --> 36:32.600
Final report.

36:34.033 --> 36:35.033
Ready.

36:35.566 --> 36:36.600
Ready.

36:37.000 --> 36:38.200
Ready.

36:40.166 --> 36:41.100
On standby.

36:43.333 --> 36:44.700
P5, report again.

36:47.300 --> 36:48.333
On standby.

37:13.866 --> 37:15.900
Maintain current positions
and keep a close eye on P5.

37:25.066 --> 37:26.200
He's getting off the car now.

38:34.800 --> 38:35.766
Code red!

38:35.833 --> 38:36.833
Cover President Yun now!

38:37.200 --> 38:38.166
Code red!

38:39.366 --> 38:40.333
President Yun!

38:58.066 --> 38:59.033
President Yun!

39:05.500 --> 39:06.833
Are you okay, sir?

39:09.666 --> 39:10.666
Ambulance!

39:11.166 --> 39:12.200
Call an ambulance!

39:20.800 --> 39:21.800
Call an ambulance!

40:12.300 --> 40:15.066
It's the emergency stairway
on the north side. Find the exit.

40:15.133 --> 40:16.100
Yes, sir.

40:51.566 --> 40:52.466
Get him!

41:46.266 --> 41:48.500
Yes. Continue the pursuit.

41:55.733 --> 41:56.566
He's over there.

44:34.266 --> 44:35.166
Stop the car.

45:16.933 --> 45:19.033
Block the subway stations
within a three-kilometer radius.

45:19.800 --> 45:20.933
He's Asian in his 30s.

45:21.433 --> 45:23.100
Request an urgent investigation
to the police.

46:03.600 --> 46:04.466
Hey.

46:13.466 --> 46:15.500
What are you doing?

46:15.566 --> 46:16.900
I saw a guy bleeding...

46:16.966 --> 46:18.666
Which one? Where?

47:28.266 --> 47:29.466
I've succeeded in the mission.

47:30.466 --> 47:32.266
I'm hiding in the safe house.

47:35.466 --> 47:38.400
I've been shot,
so I can't escape by myself.

47:40.333 --> 47:41.666
I'm requesting a rescue.

47:42.000 --> 47:43.566
What are you talking about?

47:44.566 --> 47:46.233
Are you not aware that it's highly likely

47:46.300 --> 47:49.100
to be exposed by the enemy
if we send more agents there?

47:49.566 --> 47:51.366
I am, but...

47:52.633 --> 47:53.666
For now,

47:55.766 --> 47:57.066
it's impossible

47:58.066 --> 47:59.266
to escape this place.

48:01.466 --> 48:03.233
All I can say to you now

48:05.200 --> 48:07.400
is to comply with the rules for agents.

48:08.666 --> 48:09.866
Sir,

48:11.066 --> 48:13.466
I have a reason that I must return alive.

48:15.066 --> 48:16.133
Please help me.

48:19.433 --> 48:20.366
Sir.

48:22.400 --> 48:23.366
Sir.

50:19.533 --> 50:20.666
Did you want to see me, sir?

50:23.200 --> 50:26.400
TK1 got injured in action.

50:27.366 --> 50:29.066
It'll be problematic if he gets caught.

51:47.133 --> 51:50.733
I think he's somewhere in this building.

52:16.200 --> 52:18.366
I heard that this statue has a sad story.

52:20.166 --> 52:23.166
A beautiful lady named Tatsuko lived here.

52:23.800 --> 52:25.700
One day, she drank
from the Fountain of Youth

52:26.066 --> 52:27.266
and fell under a spell,

52:27.733 --> 52:29.866
becoming a guardian dragon of Lake Tazawa.

52:32.633 --> 52:33.800
Just like her,

52:34.533 --> 52:35.666
Taro also

52:36.533 --> 52:39.766
became a guardian dragon
of Lake Towada over there.

52:42.700 --> 52:44.366
The two who were separated

52:44.966 --> 52:46.100
meet here

52:46.666 --> 52:49.066
in this lake every winter.

52:51.066 --> 52:53.166
Because of their everlasting love,

52:54.600 --> 52:55.733
this lake

52:56.366 --> 52:57.933
never freezes over in cold weather.

52:58.666 --> 52:59.966
So the two

53:00.266 --> 53:02.866
who just wanted to love each other

53:04.700 --> 53:07.300
ended up being monsters
in different places.

53:10.166 --> 53:11.233
Monsters?

53:13.200 --> 53:14.166
You're right.

53:15.133 --> 53:16.100
Monsters.

53:19.066 --> 53:20.566
That makes it even sadder.

53:21.200 --> 53:22.066
What's sad?

53:24.800 --> 53:26.000
Our job.

53:27.600 --> 53:29.266
If we keep going like this,

53:30.266 --> 53:31.866
I feel like both of us

53:32.566 --> 53:34.400
will end up being monsters someday.

53:48.233 --> 53:49.600
Should we quit our jobs?

53:57.966 --> 53:59.900
You know we can't,
no matter how much we want to.

54:45.466 --> 54:46.566
Would you like to take a sip?

54:46.800 --> 54:49.000
Where are TK1 and TK2 now?

54:52.700 --> 54:53.933
Please tell me.

54:55.766 --> 54:56.700
Sir!

54:56.766 --> 54:58.966
Fly back to Korea
on the first flight tomorrow.

55:00.333 --> 55:01.300
It's an order.

55:18.200 --> 55:19.066
Hello.

55:24.100 --> 55:25.766
Call them immediately.

55:37.266 --> 55:38.333
You're here.

55:39.000 --> 55:41.266
What's on earth is this out of the blue?

55:44.900 --> 55:45.833
TOP SECRET DOCUMENT

55:50.100 --> 55:51.300
TOP SECRET DOCUMENT

55:58.866 --> 56:01.100
How reliable is this document?

56:01.866 --> 56:05.100
This report is written based
on a special report sent

56:05.166 --> 56:07.833
to a Hungarian news agency
and the statements made by witnesses.

56:08.533 --> 56:11.700
We're convinced that the incident
really took place.

56:13.066 --> 56:15.766
I understand that the North's military,
which aimed a regime shift,

56:15.833 --> 56:18.266
is behind the assassination
of Seong-cheol Yun.

56:19.300 --> 56:22.533
But the rumor that the South
is involved in this is total nonsense.

56:23.533 --> 56:24.366
Does it mean

56:24.933 --> 56:27.166
it's South Korea that directed
the assassination?

56:28.500 --> 56:30.966
It says some conservatives who want
to maintain the tension

56:31.066 --> 56:33.600
between the South and the North
are engaged in this.

56:33.900 --> 56:36.033
This information is
from a credible source,

56:36.333 --> 56:39.033
so we're trying to figure it out
using all the available channels.

56:41.466 --> 56:43.366
Where is Deputy Director Baek?

56:43.800 --> 56:45.100
He's in Hungary right now.

56:48.400 --> 56:52.966
Shouldn't we find out what really happened
to come up with countermeasures?

56:54.066 --> 56:56.233
Before the press releases
speculative articles,

56:56.766 --> 56:59.700
we must completely identify the details
of the incident.

57:00.800 --> 57:01.633
Yes, sir.

57:18.933 --> 57:20.833
Il-young Lim and Jae-beom Ahn
are in Ukraine, right?

57:20.900 --> 57:21.733
Yes, sir.

57:21.800 --> 57:23.500
Tell them to fly to Budapest right away

57:24.266 --> 57:26.700
and report back on the actions
of the police and military there.

57:26.833 --> 57:27.666
Yes, sir.

57:27.966 --> 57:29.433
Mi-jeong, what are you doing now?

57:29.500 --> 57:32.133
I'm requesting the Japanese
and the U.S. agencies for information.

57:32.466 --> 57:33.566
Gather all the unofficial data

57:33.633 --> 57:36.566
including articles on personal blogs
and online communities run by Hungarians

57:36.733 --> 57:38.400
in Budapest and its periphery.

57:38.533 --> 57:39.366
Yes, sir.

58:12.300 --> 58:13.466
Is his location identified?

58:14.100 --> 58:16.600
Room 204 was rented out three days ago
by an unidentified tenant.

58:16.766 --> 58:17.700
What about other rooms?

58:18.066 --> 58:19.533
That's the only room rented

58:19.833 --> 58:20.833
on the second floor.

58:22.466 --> 58:23.966
Is the entrance to the building secured?

58:24.100 --> 58:25.266
Yes, it's all set.

58:25.900 --> 58:26.733
Get moving.

1:00:23.966 --> 1:00:25.166
Things got bad.

1:00:26.400 --> 1:00:28.466
Let's talk about it later
and get out of here right now.

1:00:34.833 --> 1:00:36.766
If we go to the landing field
we took Seung-ryong,

1:00:38.233 --> 1:00:39.466
we'll be able to escape.

1:00:58.033 --> 1:00:59.000
Sa-woo.

1:01:00.833 --> 1:01:01.900
I am sorry.

1:01:04.533 --> 1:01:05.566
I'm under orders.

1:01:39.100 --> 1:01:40.133
I'm under orders.

1:01:41.233 --> 1:01:44.166
If I fail to catch him,
you should chase him down until the end.

1:01:53.700 --> 1:01:54.866
What's the reason?

1:02:03.366 --> 1:02:04.400
Where's Hyun-jun's desk?

1:02:05.066 --> 1:02:06.066
What are you doing?

1:02:06.233 --> 1:02:07.800
He is charged with espionage.

1:02:16.166 --> 1:02:17.400
If I stay with you,

1:02:17.933 --> 1:02:19.966
both Sa-woo and you'll be in danger.

1:02:20.166 --> 1:02:22.066
I can't leave you here like this.

1:02:22.700 --> 1:02:23.633
Seung-hee.

1:03:22.400 --> 1:03:23.566
Hyun-jun is dead!

1:03:23.933 --> 1:03:25.266
Everyone knows that!

1:03:26.300 --> 1:03:28.166
You're the only one who doesn't!
