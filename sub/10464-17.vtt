WEBVTT

00:03.235 --> 00:05.131
You say you want a
box of chocolates

00:05.155 --> 00:06.883
or a lousy bunch of flowers?

00:06.907 --> 00:09.260
Better say pretty please with
your life savings on top.

00:09.284 --> 00:10.678
Because on this day,

00:10.702 --> 00:12.638
they have a gun to your
girlfriend's heart.

00:12.662 --> 00:14.640
We get it, Bailey. You're
not into the holiday.

00:14.664 --> 00:16.225
Do you want me to set a
place for your grandfather?

00:16.248 --> 00:17.518
No. He's away on business.

00:17.542 --> 00:18.978
So, what are you guys doing?

00:19.002 --> 00:20.980
Well, Justin's
planning something,

00:21.004 --> 00:22.356
but he won't tell me what it is.

00:22.380 --> 00:24.859
A surprise? That is so romantic.

00:24.883 --> 00:27.361
Because you want to make
reservations at a restaurant,

00:27.385 --> 00:29.363
you better be, like,
related to the president.

00:29.387 --> 00:31.574
So does that mean that
you're not making any plans

00:31.598 --> 00:33.691
or reservations for us
for Valentine's Day?

00:35.143 --> 00:37.070
Why are you smiling?

00:37.604 --> 00:39.874
Should I ask, or
is it a surprise?

00:39.898 --> 00:42.627
Sarah. You are gonna love this.

00:42.651 --> 00:44.545
Once you see how much fun it is.

00:44.569 --> 00:47.340
Once you take your
seat Wednesday night,

00:47.364 --> 00:48.799
23rd row center.

00:48.823 --> 00:51.093
You, me, Will, Gina.

00:51.117 --> 00:53.503
Will and Gina? Okay.

00:53.620 --> 00:56.140
Live at the county stadium,
it's the third annual,

00:56.164 --> 00:59.092
grand championship
monster truck show!

01:01.211 --> 01:03.439
Monster truck show?

01:03.463 --> 01:06.150
Sarah, the mighty,
fighting flatbeds,

01:06.174 --> 01:09.352
spraying mud all the way
back to the 50th row.

01:09.844 --> 01:11.030
On Valentine's Day.

01:11.054 --> 01:12.605
Yes!

01:13.014 --> 01:15.201
Well, maybe a really
nice dinner beforehand.

01:15.225 --> 01:17.453
Yeah, yeah. That would work.
That would be great.

01:17.477 --> 01:20.071
What... What is...

01:20.397 --> 01:22.031
Are you not excited?

01:22.273 --> 01:24.627
Well, Bay, it's not the,
you know, the truck show,

01:24.651 --> 01:26.796
because that sounds,
you know, great.

01:26.820 --> 01:29.173
It's just... This is my
first Valentine's Day

01:29.197 --> 01:30.591
with an actual boyfriend,

01:30.615 --> 01:32.385
and I'd kind of like
to spend it with him

01:32.409 --> 01:34.428
you know, doing
something romantic.

01:34.452 --> 01:37.765
So, what is your point?

01:37.789 --> 01:40.142
My point is, this,
this truck thing.

01:40.166 --> 01:41.843
This is your idea of romantic?

01:42.168 --> 01:45.648
Sarah, look. My idea
of romantic is...

01:45.672 --> 01:48.057
Is, is naming a star after you.

01:48.883 --> 01:49.986
My idea of romantic is...

01:50.010 --> 01:52.154
Is taking a punch in the gut

01:52.178 --> 01:53.948
to win you back from
my best friend.

01:53.972 --> 01:57.034
My idea of romantic is my idea.

01:57.058 --> 02:00.361
When I have it. Not when
the calendar tells me to.

02:01.604 --> 02:02.540
Julia.

02:02.564 --> 02:04.532
Does this mean
you're not coming?

02:06.276 --> 02:07.294
Jule.

02:07.318 --> 02:08.336
It would be fun.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.630
Can you come out here for a sec?

02:09.654 --> 02:11.924
Claud, I'm trying to keep
the sauce, from burning.

02:11.948 --> 02:13.541
Just tell me who it is...

02:17.287 --> 02:18.629
Griffin.

02:20.081 --> 02:21.507
Hey.

02:21.666 --> 02:24.061
What are you...? I
thought you were...

02:24.085 --> 02:25.845
Yeah, I, uh,

02:26.755 --> 02:30.359
got three days leave, and I
just, you know, figured,

02:30.383 --> 02:32.435
how could I come
home and not say hi?

02:34.971 --> 02:36.481
I could answer that.

03:18.890 --> 03:20.951
I thought you were
there until...

03:20.975 --> 03:22.203
Again, I probably
should have just...

03:22.227 --> 03:23.788
No. No, wait.

03:23.812 --> 03:25.822
So how's school?

03:27.398 --> 03:29.992
Oh, it's okay.

03:31.528 --> 03:33.047
So...

03:33.071 --> 03:35.123
I was just... I was
just thinking that...

03:35.323 --> 03:39.127
maybe you and I could just,
like, talk or something.

03:41.204 --> 03:42.765
Maybe that's not
such a good idea...

03:42.789 --> 03:44.382
No, no. Be my guest.

03:44.541 --> 03:45.726
Talk.

03:45.750 --> 03:47.218
Now, look.

03:47.377 --> 03:49.220
I'm gonna be leaving
tomorrow, okay?

03:49.921 --> 03:51.107
You've got my number.

03:51.131 --> 03:53.025
Just gimme a call or something.

03:53.049 --> 03:54.110
I don't know.

03:54.134 --> 03:55.393
Because I'd really like to talk.

04:00.473 --> 04:01.732
Bye.

04:10.441 --> 04:11.877
Yeah, it's me.

04:11.901 --> 04:14.046
I'm getting an earful from Phil.

04:14.070 --> 04:16.048
He wants me to bump the
cop corruption story

04:16.072 --> 04:17.874
and put the baby condor on top.

04:18.324 --> 04:19.593
Don't worry, I won't.

04:19.617 --> 04:21.595
I kept the kitchen open because
you were so damn hungry.

04:21.619 --> 04:23.629
Now take your pick, the
food or the phone.

04:24.831 --> 04:26.257
Okay. Okay.

04:26.666 --> 04:28.936
Rosemary, tell Phil
I hung up on him

04:28.960 --> 04:30.511
to get moving on the
condor footage.

04:31.254 --> 04:32.597
Lie.

04:34.007 --> 04:36.476
Now, maybe I can book
a reservation or two.

04:39.596 --> 04:41.397
You certainly got the space.

04:42.140 --> 04:44.034
You're half empty
on Valentine's.

04:44.058 --> 04:45.536
Isn't that the biggest
date night of the year?

04:45.560 --> 04:46.829
We get a lot of walk-ins.

04:46.853 --> 04:48.581
What's so bad about
being half full?

04:48.605 --> 04:50.531
Way to go for the
jugular, Charlie.

04:51.357 --> 04:53.201
We're doing just
fine here, Kathleen.

04:56.738 --> 05:00.416
Rosemary, look, when you find
the condor footage, bury it.

05:01.784 --> 05:03.345
Just do it, Rosemary.

05:03.369 --> 05:04.638
Thanks.

05:04.662 --> 05:06.422
Do you have an extra apron?

05:06.831 --> 05:08.299
In the bathroom.

05:08.333 --> 05:09.675
What?

05:09.709 --> 05:10.936
I'm not you, Kathleen.

05:10.960 --> 05:12.605
I'm not out to
conquer the market.

05:12.629 --> 05:14.648
I'm happy with business
exactly the way it is.

05:14.672 --> 05:15.848
Well, then, you're lucky.

05:16.174 --> 05:18.643
Just do nothing, and all
your dreams will come true.

05:19.677 --> 05:22.063
You know, maybe you
should just butt out.

05:25.350 --> 05:27.902
Do you wanna know where we're
gonna go on Wednesday?

05:28.436 --> 05:29.820
For Valentine's?

05:31.064 --> 05:32.990
I thought it was supposed
to be a surprise.

05:34.525 --> 05:36.170
it was, but...

05:36.194 --> 05:37.995
I don't know I feel
like telling you.

05:39.447 --> 05:40.831
Okay.

05:43.576 --> 05:46.796
My dad was gonna take my
mom to Top of the Mark,

05:46.996 --> 05:48.214
that view place.

05:48.498 --> 05:51.717
But somebody offered
him their beach house,

05:52.502 --> 05:55.012
so I got the table
at the restaurant.

05:55.672 --> 05:57.390
So how does that sound?

05:58.091 --> 05:59.850
That sounds great.

06:06.349 --> 06:08.943
I wanna talk to him, Justin.

06:14.857 --> 06:16.409
Why?

06:18.361 --> 06:22.132
Well, because we haven't
written or even spoken

06:22.156 --> 06:23.916
since the last time I saw him.

06:25.702 --> 06:27.169
What do you...

06:28.121 --> 06:29.839
What do you wanna talk about?

06:30.873 --> 06:32.851
Well, he doesn't
know we're together.

06:32.875 --> 06:34.302
I want him to know that.

06:35.253 --> 06:38.273
Don't you think that he
figured that out last night?

06:38.297 --> 06:41.684
Well, yeah, but he doesn't
really know, and...

06:42.010 --> 06:44.488
I dunno, I think that
if he really knew,

06:44.512 --> 06:48.524
then he could go back to school,
and it would just be over.

06:52.979 --> 06:54.322
Okay?

06:57.358 --> 06:58.669
Miss Reeves.

06:58.693 --> 07:01.171
These flowers came with
a Valentine's card,

07:01.195 --> 07:03.340
But no name. Could
they be for you?

07:03.364 --> 07:04.550
Doubtful.

07:04.574 --> 07:06.000
Anything for Sanders?

07:06.242 --> 07:07.469
Sean!

07:07.493 --> 07:08.512
Yeah?

07:08.536 --> 07:10.838
Hi. It's me, Sarah.

07:11.456 --> 07:12.933
I'm sorry. Sarah who?

07:12.957 --> 07:14.935
Reeves. Sarah Reeves.

07:14.959 --> 07:16.186
No. You can't be.

07:16.210 --> 07:17.396
Little Sarah Reeves has braces

07:17.420 --> 07:18.981
and goofy bangs that
hang over her eyes.

07:19.005 --> 07:20.441
Yeah, well, not
anymore, she doesn't.

07:20.465 --> 07:22.600
- I can't believe it.
- Yeah, it's me.

07:22.717 --> 07:24.153
I can't believe that it's...

07:24.177 --> 07:26.196
It's me. Okay?

07:26.220 --> 07:27.823
God.

07:27.847 --> 07:29.992
God, you're back. How's college?

07:30.016 --> 07:32.244
Fine. Well, I mean, it was fine.

07:32.268 --> 07:33.579
I've been taking a
lot of time off,

07:33.603 --> 07:34.913
writing and traveling and stuff.

07:34.937 --> 07:36.322
Just got back from Argentina.

07:36.564 --> 07:38.208
Yeah, I was doing
the cowboy thing.

07:38.232 --> 07:40.336
Man, they got sunsets
on the Pampas.

07:40.360 --> 07:41.702
Wow.

07:42.487 --> 07:44.038
Wow. Really.

07:44.405 --> 07:45.341
Wow.

07:45.365 --> 07:48.594
Boy, a lot can change in...
How long has it been?

07:48.618 --> 07:50.086
Thirty-two months.

07:51.287 --> 07:52.797
Give or take.

07:57.085 --> 07:59.011
Kathleen, this is really good.

07:59.796 --> 08:02.399
So, what restaurant
did it come from?

08:02.423 --> 08:03.974
Salinger's.

08:04.008 --> 08:05.726
If you play your cards right.

08:07.595 --> 08:09.156
Hear me out.

08:09.180 --> 08:11.399
Terrell Moore is the
chef at Entre Nous.

08:11.599 --> 08:14.078
It's common knowledge he's
been feuding with his owner.

08:14.102 --> 08:16.705
He happens to be a friend, so
I told him about Salinger's.

08:16.729 --> 08:19.907
And he is very interested in
taking over your kitchen.

08:22.652 --> 08:26.215
Kathleen, you know, I told
you, I don't need this.

08:26.239 --> 08:27.966
I'm happy with the
way things are.

08:27.990 --> 08:29.176
But you get a chef like Terrell,

08:29.200 --> 08:30.594
and your restaurant
could explode.

08:30.618 --> 08:32.001
I don't care.

08:32.370 --> 08:33.837
Don't you get that?

08:34.831 --> 08:36.892
You know what your
problem is, Charlie?

08:36.916 --> 08:38.769
You say you couldn't get married

08:38.793 --> 08:41.095
because it wasn't your
life you'd be living.

08:41.294 --> 08:42.523
And you can't run
this restaurant

08:42.547 --> 08:44.306
because it's not your dream.

08:44.382 --> 08:48.028
Well, your problem is that you
never put your name on anything.

08:48.052 --> 08:49.395
Gimme a break.

08:49.762 --> 08:51.407
But maybe if you
actually did care

08:51.431 --> 08:52.991
and you took a chance, you know,

08:53.015 --> 08:55.401
something good might happen.

08:55.643 --> 08:58.612
For once in your life,
you might not walk away.

08:58.688 --> 09:01.208
you might even wanna
say, "This is mine."

09:01.232 --> 09:02.992
You know, "I did this."

09:04.569 --> 09:05.995
Look...

09:06.904 --> 09:08.173
Even if I wanted to do this,

09:08.197 --> 09:10.384
I don't have the money
to hire a big-time chef.

09:10.408 --> 09:13.210
I mean, it's a fantasy.

09:23.129 --> 09:24.472
"I.O.U."

09:30.094 --> 09:31.937
Kathleen...

09:32.597 --> 09:33.981
Wow.

09:36.601 --> 09:37.953
That's a lot of money.

09:37.977 --> 09:38.954
It's a loan.

09:38.978 --> 09:40.529
You'll pay me back.

09:41.731 --> 09:44.992
I happen to think that
you're a good investment.

09:48.696 --> 09:50.090
See, he grew up in my building,

09:50.114 --> 09:52.050
and his parents were
friends with my parents.

09:52.074 --> 09:53.302
And he just back from traveling.

09:53.326 --> 09:54.303
So I was wondering...

09:54.327 --> 09:56.003
Will only got four tickets.

09:56.245 --> 09:57.890
To the truck show.

09:57.914 --> 10:00.100
So your friend's gonna have
to get his own ticket.

10:00.124 --> 10:02.352
And he probably won't be able
to sit right next to us,

10:02.376 --> 10:04.313
because these things
sell out all the time.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.981
I find that so hard to believe.

10:06.005 --> 10:07.232
But that's not the point.

10:07.256 --> 10:08.400
The point is,

10:08.424 --> 10:10.893
I don't wanna go
to the truck show.

10:11.844 --> 10:14.156
And Sean kind of asked if we could
get together on Wednesday night.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.274
And I said yes, but only,
only if it was okay with you.

10:18.142 --> 10:20.245
Well, I don't know. I mean...

10:20.269 --> 10:24.198
We did make plans, sort of.

10:24.232 --> 10:27.211
But, I mean, if it's something
you really wanna do, then,

10:27.235 --> 10:29.495
then, yeah, of course.

10:30.571 --> 10:31.548
Here you go.

10:31.572 --> 10:32.549
Thanks.

10:32.573 --> 10:34.458
Well, do you maybe
wanna join us?

10:36.619 --> 10:38.222
Let's see...

10:38.246 --> 10:40.474
Reminiscing about your childhood
in the apartment building

10:40.498 --> 10:43.551
or watching a 600-horsepower
battle royal.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.687
Reminiscing...

10:45.711 --> 10:46.980
Battle royal...

10:47.004 --> 10:48.899
Childhood in the apartment,
Six hundred horses.

10:48.923 --> 10:51.527
Look, Bailey, I know you're
just doing this to be nice.

10:51.551 --> 10:53.820
And if it matters to you at
all, I can cancel with Sean.

10:53.844 --> 10:55.280
No, why should you do that?

10:55.304 --> 10:57.032
Look, you do what you wanna do,

10:57.056 --> 10:58.283
And I'll do what I wanna do.

10:58.307 --> 11:00.025
And we'll meet up afterwards.

11:00.851 --> 11:02.319
Okay?

11:02.395 --> 11:03.863
Damn it.

11:04.105 --> 11:06.031
I just lost my cinnamon stick.

11:06.190 --> 11:07.658
So use your finger.

11:07.942 --> 11:09.243
I'll get burned.

11:13.239 --> 11:16.917
I really wasn't expecting to
see him at your place. I...

11:17.827 --> 11:19.554
I thought that was over.

11:19.578 --> 11:22.381
Well, it was, but we, sort of...

11:23.791 --> 11:25.551
We got back together.

11:25.668 --> 11:27.928
Oh, hey. That's cool.

11:28.087 --> 11:29.597
That's... I'm glad.

11:30.131 --> 11:32.683
Well, I'm not glad.

11:35.052 --> 11:36.645
Justin's an okay guy.

11:38.264 --> 11:39.565
Yeah.

11:41.183 --> 11:42.651
So...

11:43.060 --> 11:45.372
You two are, like...

11:45.396 --> 11:47.489
We've slept together, Griffin.

11:50.192 --> 11:51.211
I wasn't asking that.

11:51.235 --> 11:52.546
Yeah, but I think
you should know.

11:52.570 --> 11:55.289
I'm with Justin. I'm
really with him.

12:01.412 --> 12:03.714
So, how is it?

12:04.582 --> 12:06.727
School. Is it okay
for you there?

12:06.751 --> 12:07.885
No.

12:08.544 --> 12:10.981
No. It's pretty bad, actually.

12:11.005 --> 12:12.431
Really?

12:13.591 --> 12:15.601
It's, like...

12:15.718 --> 12:17.362
I don't know.

12:17.386 --> 12:20.064
All the uniforms and the...

12:21.307 --> 12:23.984
All the people just like
my dad, yelling at me.

12:25.895 --> 12:27.247
Well, maybe...

12:27.271 --> 12:29.073
I can write you a little.

12:29.482 --> 12:31.533
Maybe I'm not going back there.

12:33.486 --> 12:36.131
Griffin, don't talk like that.

12:36.155 --> 12:37.507
Your dad made a deal
with the judge.

12:37.531 --> 12:38.925
you have to finish the year.

12:38.949 --> 12:42.544
That was his deal. Not mine.

12:43.829 --> 12:46.298
Are you talking

12:47.083 --> 12:48.801
about running away?

12:51.170 --> 12:53.013
Well, I'm not just
talking about it.

12:53.756 --> 12:54.941
I'm pretty much doing it.

12:54.965 --> 12:55.901
Griffin...

12:55.925 --> 12:57.393
My plane left an hour ago.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.772
When it lands without
me, I'm gone.

13:11.857 --> 13:13.826
I'm coming, I'm coming,
I'm coming, I'm coming.

13:15.528 --> 13:17.506
Hey. Shouldn't you be
at school or something?

13:17.530 --> 13:18.757
Where's Julia?

13:18.781 --> 13:21.291
Yeah, hey, but, she's up...

13:21.617 --> 13:24.461
Justin.

13:27.206 --> 13:28.549
Justin.

13:28.666 --> 13:29.893
You lied to me.

13:29.917 --> 13:31.186
No. Justin, wait.

13:31.210 --> 13:32.771
He needed a place to stay.
That was all.

13:32.795 --> 13:34.648
He slept on the couch.
I can show you where.

13:34.672 --> 13:37.317
Stop. I don't want to do this.
Not again.

13:37.341 --> 13:40.519
I don't want to talk about
it, not until he is gone.

13:49.603 --> 13:51.706
I don't see why they didn't
do this a long time ago.

13:51.730 --> 13:54.835
I mean, Fred's got
one, Barney's got one.

13:54.859 --> 13:57.536
Betty's a main character. She
should have her own vitamin.

13:57.611 --> 13:58.839
It's unfair.

13:58.863 --> 14:00.706
Yeah, well, the world's
unfair, Bailey.

14:02.867 --> 14:04.219
There you are.

14:04.243 --> 14:05.512
What, are you hiding from me?

14:05.536 --> 14:07.556
Just gonna pretend it
never happened, huh?

14:07.580 --> 14:08.557
What?

14:08.581 --> 14:09.891
You know what.

14:09.915 --> 14:11.476
Where's my sweater, thief?

14:11.500 --> 14:13.177
Hey, I was gonna give it back.

14:15.671 --> 14:17.149
Bailey, Sean.

14:17.173 --> 14:18.849
Sean, Bailey.

14:19.175 --> 14:20.193
How you doing?

14:20.217 --> 14:21.903
See, Sean lent me his
sweater last night

14:21.927 --> 14:23.113
when we went up on the roof.

14:23.137 --> 14:24.156
The roof?

14:24.180 --> 14:25.907
Yeah, we were checking
out the stars.

14:25.931 --> 14:28.525
I was showing Sarah how
different they are in Paraguay.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.070
The stars in Paraguay, huh?

14:31.771 --> 14:34.666
Did you show him the star
that I named for you?

14:34.690 --> 14:37.753
Yeah, well, I tried to, but...

14:37.777 --> 14:39.337
it was in the wrong place.

14:39.361 --> 14:41.590
No way. Because the
certificate...

14:41.614 --> 14:43.633
Right coordinates. Wrong constellation.
I checked it.

14:43.657 --> 14:45.709
You won't be able to see it
until the summer solstice.

14:45.785 --> 14:46.928
But it's there.

14:46.952 --> 14:48.847
You know, it's not like you
got ripped off or anything.

14:48.871 --> 14:50.005
Huh?

14:50.956 --> 14:54.519
So, Sarah tells me you
dropped out of college.

14:54.543 --> 14:55.677
Yeah.

14:55.961 --> 14:57.773
For love. Isn't that romantic?

14:57.797 --> 15:00.025
Yeah, his girlfriend ran
off with the Peace Corps.

15:00.049 --> 15:02.486
So he moved to South America
just to be with her.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.487
Can you believe that?

15:03.511 --> 15:05.312
Really? Where is she now?

15:06.055 --> 15:08.867
In the hands of some guy
named Marco, I'm afraid.

15:08.891 --> 15:10.577
So there I am,

15:10.601 --> 15:12.078
standing on a dock
in Florianopolis.

15:12.102 --> 15:14.446
I'm alone, broken-hearted.

15:14.980 --> 15:16.458
But then I realized,

15:16.482 --> 15:18.168
I finally have something
worth writing about.

15:18.192 --> 15:20.410
So, that's what I did.

15:22.571 --> 15:24.998
God, that is so romantic.

15:25.324 --> 15:27.260
You know, I'd love to read
some of your stuff sometime.

15:27.284 --> 15:29.262
Sure. Hey, if I can
read some of yours too.

15:29.286 --> 15:31.171
- Of course.
- Well...

15:31.622 --> 15:33.799
I'm double-parked, so,

15:34.708 --> 15:35.926
you ready to go, Sarah?

15:36.293 --> 15:38.762
Upholstered seats and
padded booths a must.

15:38.796 --> 15:40.899
All new indirect
lighting a must.

15:40.923 --> 15:42.526
Wolf Commercial Eight
flames a must...

15:42.550 --> 15:45.644
Okay, okay. Let's
take a breath here.

15:46.345 --> 15:49.022
Whatever you need for
the food, you got it.

15:49.056 --> 15:51.243
But the furniture
and the lights...

15:51.267 --> 15:53.193
That's gonna have to wait.

15:53.602 --> 15:56.113
I can't afford to do the place
over, Terrell. Not yet.

15:56.188 --> 15:57.582
But if you can bring
'em in with the food...

15:57.606 --> 15:59.000
I can bring 'em in.

15:59.024 --> 16:00.534
We'll talk about the
rest of it then.

16:02.611 --> 16:04.288
I'll take another
look at your kitchen.

16:05.281 --> 16:06.716
Our kitchen.

16:06.740 --> 16:08.167
Hey, K!

16:08.534 --> 16:10.127
You look like death.

16:12.830 --> 16:15.225
Kathleen, he is great.

16:15.249 --> 16:17.143
I should have done
this so long ago.

16:17.167 --> 16:18.144
Bar open yet?

16:18.168 --> 16:19.354
And I owe it all to you.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.846
How can I thank you?

16:21.797 --> 16:23.599
How about a drink?

16:23.757 --> 16:25.434
Hey. What's the matter?

16:28.345 --> 16:30.022
You know what I always hated?

16:31.015 --> 16:34.151
I always hated those conferences
for women executives.

16:35.227 --> 16:37.038
And all they did
was bitch and moan

16:37.062 --> 16:39.448
that men can't take us
in power positions.

16:40.441 --> 16:43.128
Me, I thought if breasts
threw a man off balance,

16:43.152 --> 16:44.745
so much the better.

16:49.116 --> 16:52.502
I thought whatever they had
for me, I could handle.

16:54.163 --> 16:55.640
What happened?

16:55.664 --> 16:58.050
They dropped me to the
five 'o clock news.

16:59.084 --> 17:00.270
I mean, the six was bad enough,

17:00.294 --> 17:02.596
but at least you could pretend
that you were a journalist.

17:06.342 --> 17:07.893
Are you okay?

17:09.011 --> 17:10.896
I can't go back there, Charlie.

17:12.097 --> 17:14.358
I mean, my office is all glass.

17:15.309 --> 17:18.612
I can't let 'em see me rattled.

17:21.941 --> 17:23.867
Eyes on your own paper.

17:25.527 --> 17:27.162
Julia.

17:27.655 --> 17:29.498
Come on out here.

17:30.199 --> 17:32.542
You're a friend of
his, aren't you?

17:32.743 --> 17:34.679
Well, yeah. I mean,
kind of, but...

17:34.703 --> 17:36.723
Your friend made a
deal with the judge.

17:36.747 --> 17:39.049
I'm here to make sure
he doesn't break it.

17:39.333 --> 17:41.394
If Griffin doesn't go back
to school in Louisiana

17:41.418 --> 17:42.687
like he's supposed to,

17:42.711 --> 17:45.347
he's gonna find himself
in a lot of trouble.

17:45.673 --> 17:47.275
I said I haven't see him.

17:47.299 --> 17:48.642
But if you do,

17:48.926 --> 17:51.353
you might want to
tell him what I said.

18:04.274 --> 18:05.460
Hey.

18:05.484 --> 18:06.920
Hey.

18:06.944 --> 18:09.246
God. Sean's poetry, amazing.

18:11.615 --> 18:13.250
You've got...

18:15.828 --> 18:17.379
So listen.

18:17.955 --> 18:20.558
Will and I were watching
the monster truck show

18:20.582 --> 18:23.302
pretrials on cable
last night, and, uh...

18:23.460 --> 18:26.430
And I think I got my
monster truck fix.

18:26.755 --> 18:30.851
So I was thinking that maybe I
don't need to go after all.

18:31.135 --> 18:33.697
No. Don't do that. No.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.699
Because you were so excited
about it, you know.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.618
And all that stuff about the
mud spraying in your face.

18:38.642 --> 18:40.078
I mean, cable can't
do that justice.

18:40.102 --> 18:41.788
Well, no. But...

18:41.812 --> 18:44.332
But, it's Valentine's Day.

18:44.356 --> 18:45.792
And you were right, Bailey.

18:45.816 --> 18:47.836
What's so important
about Valentine's Day?

18:47.860 --> 18:50.620
You know, it's just another
date on the calendar, right?

18:51.905 --> 18:52.966
Yeah, but...

18:52.990 --> 18:54.843
Besides, I think it'll
be really good for us.

18:54.867 --> 18:56.594
Because you're excited
about your truck show,

18:56.618 --> 18:58.763
and I'm excited
about seeing Sean.

18:58.787 --> 19:00.598
And we'll probably
just be talking

19:00.622 --> 19:01.933
about poetry and
books all night.

19:01.957 --> 19:03.393
You'd be bored out of your mind.

19:03.417 --> 19:05.469
So it works out all
around, right?

19:05.836 --> 19:07.346
Unless...

19:07.755 --> 19:10.390
Did you not want me to see Sean?

19:11.091 --> 19:14.696
No. No.

19:14.720 --> 19:16.772
No, Sean's great.

19:17.222 --> 19:18.774
I love Sean.

19:19.224 --> 19:20.901
Yeah, me too.

19:24.521 --> 19:26.656
Steve, there's a fax for you.

19:27.399 --> 19:29.201
Let's get it Right now, okay?

19:33.447 --> 19:34.664
What are you doing here?

19:34.907 --> 19:36.541
What are you doing here?

19:37.201 --> 19:38.762
This morning you said you
weren't gonna come back.

19:38.786 --> 19:40.096
Yeah, but see, the
way to show them

19:40.120 --> 19:41.431
is to just work twice as hard.

19:41.455 --> 19:43.391
Because if I can squeeze
a few extra pieces

19:43.415 --> 19:44.851
out of the staff per show,

19:44.875 --> 19:48.605
and maybe boost the ratings
by a point or two.

19:48.629 --> 19:50.774
Then they'll see what I can
do with the five o'clock.

19:50.798 --> 19:52.400
And they'll want more
of the same at six.

19:52.424 --> 19:53.767
You know what? You're nuts.

19:59.348 --> 20:00.700
Hey, wait!

20:00.724 --> 20:01.701
What are you doing?

20:01.725 --> 20:02.994
You're getting outta here.

20:03.018 --> 20:04.496
Charlie, where are
you taking me?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.164
Just get in the car and go.

20:06.188 --> 20:07.665
I'll get somebody
to look after Owen,

20:07.689 --> 20:09.584
and we'll just drive.
Maybe go to Napa.

20:09.608 --> 20:11.586
Charlie, I can't just take off.
I'll get in trouble.

20:11.610 --> 20:13.004
You're already in trouble.

20:13.028 --> 20:15.256
Think you can solve all your
problems by working harder?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.466
Kathleen you work
too hard already.

20:16.490 --> 20:18.051
You need to step back
and ask yourself,

20:18.075 --> 20:19.427
"What's wrong with
this picture?"

20:19.451 --> 20:20.595
Charlie, please.

20:20.619 --> 20:22.806
You're never gonna get out of
this, until somebody drags you.

20:22.830 --> 20:24.256
Charlie, put me down!

20:26.166 --> 20:28.593
So you called me. That
means he's gone, right?

20:29.002 --> 20:30.971
Not exactly. Not yet.

20:32.798 --> 20:34.943
Justin, a guy from court
came by school today.

20:34.967 --> 20:37.195
And they know that Griffin
is a friend of mine.

20:37.219 --> 20:38.321
And sooner or later,

20:38.345 --> 20:40.355
they're gonna come
here looking for him.

20:42.182 --> 20:43.650
So tell him to leave.

20:43.976 --> 20:46.371
Well, he wants to,

20:46.395 --> 20:48.498
but he has to pick up
his motorcycle first.

20:48.522 --> 20:50.824
A friend of his is keeping
it in his garage.

20:52.401 --> 20:53.670
So, what's the problem?

20:53.694 --> 20:56.204
Well, he can't get the bike
until tomorrow, and...

20:58.031 --> 21:00.083
He can't pick it up himself.

21:00.534 --> 21:02.470
Because if his friend
knows he's on the bike

21:02.494 --> 21:04.754
then so will his dad,
and so will the judge.

21:05.372 --> 21:06.631
Oh, man.

21:06.915 --> 21:08.810
- Justin, please.
- No.

21:08.834 --> 21:12.272
He needs a place to stay and he
needs someone to pick up his bike.

21:12.296 --> 21:14.639
And I'm sorry, but there's
no one else I can ask.

21:15.757 --> 21:17.360
Are you out of your mind?

21:17.384 --> 21:19.571
Why would you ever
think I would do this?

21:19.595 --> 21:21.406
Because he's in trouble.
Because he needs help.

21:21.430 --> 21:23.324
And why should I care
after what he did?

21:23.348 --> 21:24.576
Because he's a friend of mine.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.744
Yeah, Julia, the guy is a loser.

21:26.768 --> 21:28.580
He stole money
from your brother.

21:28.604 --> 21:30.540
And now he's trying to get you
to help him break the law?

21:30.564 --> 21:32.876
You... You don't understand.

21:32.900 --> 21:35.452
You're right. You're right.
I do not understand.

21:40.574 --> 21:44.470
Justin, you're the
only one I can ask.

21:44.494 --> 21:48.256
And so I'm asking. Okay?

21:49.249 --> 21:51.968
You want him out of here.
This is how.

21:52.211 --> 21:54.888
I mean, you do this,
and he's gone.

21:57.257 --> 21:59.944
Because after he leaves,
he can't come home.

21:59.968 --> 22:02.604
I mean, not for a
really long time.

22:10.771 --> 22:11.988
All right.

22:32.542 --> 22:34.219
Okay, that's it.

22:34.795 --> 22:37.231
It's not a getaway vacation
until you stop working.

22:37.255 --> 22:39.275
I'm not working. I'm just
cleaning up some files.

22:39.299 --> 22:40.777
You are worse off
than I thought.

22:40.801 --> 22:42.644
Careful. That has my
whole life on it.

22:42.678 --> 22:44.072
Now the cell phone.

22:44.096 --> 22:45.939
I turned it off. It won't ring.

22:48.433 --> 22:49.943
And the beeper.

22:51.895 --> 22:53.280
No.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.208
Give it to me.

22:55.232 --> 22:56.209
- No.
- Give it.

22:56.233 --> 22:57.251
- No.
- Give it.

22:57.275 --> 22:58.336
No!

22:58.360 --> 23:00.453
Leave me a damn
lifeline, will you?

23:10.664 --> 23:13.267
Okay. I'm feeling

23:13.291 --> 23:15.395
some extreme
discomfort right now.

23:15.419 --> 23:18.022
Which you would
probably say is proof

23:18.046 --> 23:19.806
that this is something
I needed to do.

23:21.550 --> 23:23.277
You've got a lot
of nerve, Charlie.

23:23.301 --> 23:26.271
Just breeze in and
take over my life.

23:26.471 --> 23:29.107
You always want to be
in charge, Kathleen.

23:29.599 --> 23:32.068
Try letting someone
else do the driving.

23:33.729 --> 23:36.031
Why? Why would I wanna do that?

23:37.733 --> 23:39.659
Because maybe you'll like it.

23:46.324 --> 23:47.552
Bay, it's all yours.

23:47.576 --> 23:49.220
I didn't even cap the
toothpaste, I was so fast.

23:49.244 --> 23:50.754
But you'd better hurry.

23:52.706 --> 23:54.424
Bay? Hello?

23:55.125 --> 23:58.595
Hey. Can I ask you something?

23:58.837 --> 24:01.733
You know, like, hypothetically?

24:01.757 --> 24:02.775
Sure.

24:02.799 --> 24:04.351
Okay...

24:06.511 --> 24:08.188
Let's say you were a girl.

24:08.513 --> 24:11.566
And you, like, fell
in love with me.

24:12.017 --> 24:13.902
Extremely hypothetical.

24:14.102 --> 24:15.612
Yes.

24:16.396 --> 24:17.957
And then I made

24:17.981 --> 24:21.377
one teeny, tiny...
little mistake...

24:21.401 --> 24:23.796
You mean, like insisting
on going to the truck show

24:23.820 --> 24:25.747
for Valentine's Day.

24:26.323 --> 24:29.167
Okay. Like... Okay, like that.

24:29.785 --> 24:32.003
Would that make it easier
for you to, like...

24:33.371 --> 24:34.807
To start looking
around at other guys?

24:34.831 --> 24:35.975
No, of course not.

24:35.999 --> 24:38.186
Bay, don't be silly.
Sarah loves you.

24:38.210 --> 24:40.595
Right. Right. She loves me.

24:42.089 --> 24:43.066
She loves me.

24:43.090 --> 24:44.307
And it's not like you can,

24:45.258 --> 24:47.143
be in love with two
people at the same time.

24:48.762 --> 24:52.148
Well, it... I don't know.

24:54.768 --> 24:56.829
I think that people
can be in love

24:56.853 --> 24:59.406
with more than one person
for different reasons.

25:02.109 --> 25:03.753
You do?

25:03.777 --> 25:07.956
It's love, Bay, there
aren't any rules.

25:09.574 --> 25:11.042
Yeah.

25:14.204 --> 25:15.922
No answer, huh?

25:16.832 --> 25:18.133
No.

25:18.917 --> 25:20.135
Where the hell is he?

25:20.252 --> 25:21.646
I don't know. He must be out.

25:21.670 --> 25:23.064
Yeah, well, he
better show up soon,

25:23.088 --> 25:24.899
because I'm not gonna
do this again tonight.

25:24.923 --> 25:25.900
You understand?

25:25.924 --> 25:27.985
I'm not gonna sneak you
around my parents again.

25:28.009 --> 25:30.071
I mean, you can sleep on
the street for all I care.

25:30.095 --> 25:31.896
You know I don't wanna
be here either.

25:32.514 --> 25:33.699
If I had anyplace else...

25:33.723 --> 25:35.076
Yeah, well, you're here.

25:35.100 --> 25:36.619
And you're not gonna screw
up my plans tonight.

25:36.643 --> 25:37.986
I can tell you that right now.

25:39.980 --> 25:41.698
Valentine's Day.

25:46.778 --> 25:48.548
What are you guys doing tonight?

25:48.572 --> 25:50.999
None of your business.
And get off my bed.

25:52.450 --> 25:54.878
Boy, I can really see
what she sees in you.

25:55.620 --> 25:57.172
Shut up, man.

25:59.207 --> 26:00.758
So did you get her something?

26:14.181 --> 26:15.523
Wow.

26:17.392 --> 26:19.194
Wow, that's nice.

26:20.687 --> 26:22.614
She'll like that.

26:24.900 --> 26:26.534
- Think so?
- Yeah.

26:26.776 --> 26:29.621
Yeah. I don't really have the kind of
cash to get her something like that.

26:30.530 --> 26:32.624
Not that I would anyway.

26:37.037 --> 26:38.338
You guys are lucky.

26:44.294 --> 26:46.346
You know, I've done
stories about this.

26:47.130 --> 26:48.357
People carving out "me" time,

26:48.381 --> 26:50.683
being pampered, like,
queen for a day.

26:51.092 --> 26:53.237
And I've always thought
they must be so bored,

26:53.261 --> 26:54.854
if this is what they have to do.

26:55.805 --> 26:59.160
But I have had such a
good time here, Charlie.

26:59.184 --> 27:00.693
Really.

27:00.769 --> 27:02.695
That's great. That's really...

27:05.106 --> 27:06.783
Who can that be?

27:07.776 --> 27:09.462
You checked in. You
gave them our number.

27:09.486 --> 27:10.504
No, I didn't.

27:10.528 --> 27:12.622
Well, how else could
they find us?

27:13.657 --> 27:15.416
Maybe I let it slip.

27:15.784 --> 27:18.054
God. I was having
such a good time.

27:18.078 --> 27:20.421
I cannot believe you did this.

27:22.916 --> 27:24.467
Hello?

27:24.751 --> 27:26.469
Who?

27:29.464 --> 27:30.890
It's the restaurant.

27:31.591 --> 27:33.142
It's for you.

27:33.802 --> 27:36.938
Hernandez, Miguel

27:37.889 --> 27:41.067
Dot, dot, dot Dot, dot, dot

27:41.226 --> 27:44.038
34 West Eighth

27:44.062 --> 27:46.698
Dot dot dot.

27:47.816 --> 27:49.752
This is a Valentine's poem?

27:49.776 --> 27:52.046
You should get up there and show
them what poetry's all about.

27:52.070 --> 27:54.173
Hernia doctor

27:54.197 --> 27:55.540
The

27:55.699 --> 27:59.002
Dot, dot. Dot.

28:05.208 --> 28:06.310
Okay.

28:06.334 --> 28:10.513
That was "White Page"
by Patrick Campbell.

28:10.964 --> 28:14.527
The mike is open for anyone else
who'd like to share their work.

28:14.551 --> 28:16.445
Come on. You can hitch
halfway across the planet,

28:16.469 --> 28:17.989
but you can't take two
steps to that stage?

28:18.013 --> 28:19.740
Okay. Okay.

28:19.764 --> 28:21.024
Go.

28:27.772 --> 28:29.125
- Hey. Hey.
- Hey.

28:29.149 --> 28:30.418
Guess what.

28:30.442 --> 28:33.004
They cut my favorite event,
the tractor compactor.

28:33.028 --> 28:34.964
So I said, screw it.
I bagged the show.

28:34.988 --> 28:37.341
And I am available to do
whatever you want to do.

28:37.365 --> 28:38.583
Bailey.

28:41.202 --> 28:42.879
I wrote this for a friend.

28:44.831 --> 28:47.216
Ugly duckling breaks her egg

28:47.792 --> 28:49.969
Stumbles forth On
legs that shake

28:50.086 --> 28:52.732
Can't quite waddle
Can't quite swim

28:52.756 --> 28:55.516
Wow. A regular Henry
David Longfellow.

28:55.592 --> 28:57.477
Blindly follows Loyal and brave

28:57.927 --> 29:00.063
Dirty feathers in her wake

29:00.680 --> 29:02.106
Season passes

29:02.641 --> 29:04.442
Now, she's new

29:05.685 --> 29:08.029
Long white body Silken neck

29:08.563 --> 29:10.615
Arching back Swelling breast

29:10.649 --> 29:12.168
- Hey.
- Bailey.

29:12.192 --> 29:14.452
Wings spread wide As yawning sky

29:14.944 --> 29:17.372
Fan the love in my mind's eye

29:18.531 --> 29:20.968
For in this world
There's no one fairer

29:20.992 --> 29:22.377
That's it.

29:22.494 --> 29:25.213
Than my shining, lovely

29:38.093 --> 29:41.280
Look I signed the pink
slip over to you.

29:41.304 --> 29:43.407
Here, just tell him we did it
through the mail, you know.

29:43.431 --> 29:44.992
Tell 'em you sent me a
check for 300 bucks.

29:45.016 --> 29:47.735
All right. Fine, fine.
I'd be happy to do it.

29:48.144 --> 29:50.738
It's not like our reservations
aren't already ruined.

29:54.275 --> 29:56.119
I need some air.

30:06.621 --> 30:09.392
So, do you have enough money?

30:09.416 --> 30:12.061
I mean, for gas and stuff.

30:12.085 --> 30:13.761
I'm okay.

30:14.045 --> 30:16.014
Where are you gonna go?
Have you thought about it?

30:16.423 --> 30:17.849
I don't know.

30:18.967 --> 30:20.435
A little.

30:21.094 --> 30:23.271
I really don't want
to go anywhere.

30:23.972 --> 30:26.742
Well, Griffin, they're looking for you.
You have to.

30:26.766 --> 30:27.910
Yeah, but I want to stay here.

30:27.934 --> 30:30.611
Yeah, but you can't do that.
I mean, you can't be here.

30:31.730 --> 30:33.239
Because...

30:35.567 --> 30:37.118
Because I'm in love with you.

30:39.779 --> 30:44.301
Oh man.

30:44.325 --> 30:46.127
Griffin, please, you can't.

30:48.246 --> 30:49.922
What do you want from me?

30:50.331 --> 30:51.809
I'm sorry.

30:51.833 --> 30:54.103
You told me not to write to you.
Do you remember?

30:54.127 --> 30:55.730
I mean, you told me
to forget about you.

30:55.754 --> 30:57.597
- I was...
- I'm sorry.

31:00.133 --> 31:02.101
What was I supposed to do?

31:02.552 --> 31:06.105
I mean, what did you
expect to happen?

31:07.390 --> 31:09.150
I don't know.

31:13.688 --> 31:14.749
I just want you back.

31:14.773 --> 31:16.407
Griffin...

31:17.734 --> 31:19.243
Hey!

31:21.237 --> 31:23.164
Take this, or I'm gonna drop it.

31:27.660 --> 31:28.929
Julia, get in the car.

31:28.953 --> 31:30.014
Justin.

31:30.038 --> 31:31.506
Get in the car!

31:38.171 --> 31:39.472
Julia.

31:54.479 --> 31:56.749
I cannot believe you did that.

31:56.773 --> 31:58.866
You can't... Look at my nose.

31:58.942 --> 32:00.169
You're nuts, guy.

32:00.193 --> 32:01.378
Hey, you asked for it, pal.

32:01.402 --> 32:03.079
I didn't ask for anything.

32:03.154 --> 32:04.632
It was an idiotic thing to do.

32:04.656 --> 32:05.633
Oh, really?

32:05.657 --> 32:08.209
Well, it was no more idiotic
than your idiotic poem.

32:08.368 --> 32:10.888
"Fairer" to rhyme with "Sarah."

32:10.912 --> 32:13.172
Get real, buddy. How
lame can you get?

32:13.206 --> 32:14.590
You idiot.

32:14.833 --> 32:17.061
It rhymes with
"Clara," not "Sarah."

32:17.085 --> 32:19.095
That was my
ex-girlfriend's name.

32:19.420 --> 32:21.607
See? You can still
make it out there.

32:21.631 --> 32:23.349
Underneath all the blood.

32:23.716 --> 32:26.102
And besides, she's
in love with you.

32:26.594 --> 32:28.197
Moron.

32:28.221 --> 32:30.189
Haven't you ever
read her poetry?

32:30.515 --> 32:31.816
God.

32:34.394 --> 32:37.039
Well, you gotta
admit that it was...

32:37.063 --> 32:38.374
That it was romantic.

32:38.398 --> 32:41.669
You know, that I would
actually run up there and...

32:41.693 --> 32:43.536
And punch him out?

32:44.028 --> 32:45.965
Roses are romantic, Bailey.

32:45.989 --> 32:47.424
Little heart-shaped candies

32:47.448 --> 32:48.676
with stupid things
written on 'em,

32:48.700 --> 32:49.927
that's romantic.

32:49.951 --> 32:51.470
Even a poem that doesn't
rhyme is romantic,

32:51.494 --> 32:53.347
But if you think that
I'm gonna say "My hero"

32:53.371 --> 32:55.391
and swoon in your arms because
you punch some guy in the nose,

32:55.415 --> 32:57.383
you're out of your mind!

33:17.061 --> 33:18.696
Hey.

33:19.731 --> 33:21.667
Griffin, I thought you were...

33:21.691 --> 33:25.536
Yeah, look, I just need
a place to leave this.

33:25.570 --> 33:27.580
I can't... Can't take it home.

33:29.532 --> 33:32.752
Do you have some extra room,
maybe, in your garage?

33:32.785 --> 33:34.420
I mean, I'll pick it up.

33:37.498 --> 33:39.175
When I'm finished with school.

33:39.834 --> 33:42.479
Wait a minute. You're going back?
Really?

33:42.503 --> 33:43.480
Yeah.

33:43.504 --> 33:45.890
See, the thing is

33:47.216 --> 33:50.269
that usually, I just
jump into things.

33:51.763 --> 33:54.148
Just without thinking,
I just do it.

33:54.933 --> 33:58.778
I mean, I could just take off.
Just bolt.

33:59.687 --> 34:04.659
But, except that would mean
I'd never see you again.

34:08.655 --> 34:11.456
So, for once in my life, I'm...

34:13.326 --> 34:16.963
I'm gonna think about
you know, after.

34:19.373 --> 34:21.132
And...

34:21.876 --> 34:23.636
I'm gonna stick out school.

34:25.088 --> 34:27.639
I mean, who knows?
Maybe later, we...

34:29.257 --> 34:30.319
Griffin...

34:30.342 --> 34:31.893
I don't expect you to

34:32.637 --> 34:34.772
tell me that something's
gonna happen.

34:37.016 --> 34:39.652
I don't want you to
tell me you love me.

34:41.813 --> 34:44.197
I don't want you to tell me
you don't either, because...

34:45.149 --> 34:46.710
What I need is...

34:46.734 --> 34:51.246
I need to... think
that I have a chance.

34:54.283 --> 34:56.053
Because...

34:56.077 --> 34:57.628
that's why I'm going back there.

35:06.587 --> 35:08.389
Well, I think...

35:10.133 --> 35:12.893
I think you should
leave your bike.

35:13.302 --> 35:15.771
I think I can make some room.

35:23.312 --> 35:26.000
I just drove 75 miles
to get back here

35:26.024 --> 35:27.292
because you tried
to shut us down

35:27.316 --> 35:29.294
on one of the busiest
nights of the year?

35:29.318 --> 35:31.338
Look, people know that
I'm here, Charlie.

35:31.362 --> 35:33.298
My friends are coming to see me.

35:33.322 --> 35:35.968
And you got a menu
that I didn't create.

35:35.992 --> 35:38.544
I don't care what your
friends think, Terrell.

35:38.786 --> 35:40.431
Nobody's writing
any reviews yet.

35:40.455 --> 35:41.765
And even if they were,
you have no right

35:41.789 --> 35:43.225
to shut down this restaurant.

35:43.249 --> 35:44.550
I don't?

35:49.088 --> 35:50.848
You see that name up there?

35:52.425 --> 35:54.528
Salinger's. That is
my name, Terrell.

35:54.552 --> 35:56.187
This is my restaurant.

35:56.888 --> 35:58.949
Keeping it open during the
transition was my decision.

35:58.973 --> 36:00.900
And it was my decision to make.

36:01.684 --> 36:03.620
I never want to get
another phone call

36:03.644 --> 36:05.080
from one of my managers
like that again.

36:05.104 --> 36:06.864
You understand?

36:16.574 --> 36:19.053
So, you sure Griffin's
gone this time?

36:19.077 --> 36:20.512
He's not gonna show up

36:20.536 --> 36:21.972
and ask me to boost
his old man's car?

36:21.996 --> 36:24.006
He's gone, Justin.

36:24.373 --> 36:27.635
You know, I keep
thinking about him,

36:28.711 --> 36:30.846
trying to figure out

36:30.880 --> 36:33.182
I don't know, what
it means to us.

36:34.133 --> 36:37.895
And, I had this
really weird idea.

36:38.721 --> 36:40.940
I mean, it's way out there.

36:41.349 --> 36:42.409
Okay?

36:42.433 --> 36:44.110
But, what if,

36:45.895 --> 36:48.082
I mean, and this is
not really for real.

36:48.106 --> 36:50.199
This is, kind of,
sort of, for real.

36:50.441 --> 36:52.827
What if you and me...

36:54.320 --> 36:56.038
got

36:56.072 --> 36:57.665
engaged?

36:58.032 --> 37:01.512
Engaged to get engaged.
To get engaged

37:01.536 --> 37:03.129
to get married.

37:03.371 --> 37:06.632
Sort of. I mean, maybe, someday.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.345
I mean... I know, it's,

37:12.505 --> 37:15.400
I mean, just so that we know,
I mean, not that we know.

37:15.424 --> 37:18.737
But so we have an idea
that we're kind of going

37:18.761 --> 37:20.229
in the same direction.

37:20.721 --> 37:23.107
I mean, I know, I know.
It's huge.

37:24.058 --> 37:27.486
There's no way it
can't be, but...

37:28.688 --> 37:30.624
Oh, man. I can't believe...

37:30.648 --> 37:32.533
No. Justin.

37:33.359 --> 37:35.035
It's okay. I mean...

37:35.862 --> 37:38.706
It's okay to think about it.

37:40.825 --> 37:42.501
Okay. To think?

37:44.787 --> 37:46.464
Good. Good.

37:47.206 --> 37:48.716
Great.

37:54.297 --> 37:57.725
These are, lemon branches and...

37:58.092 --> 37:59.027
And baby's...

37:59.051 --> 38:00.436
- Breath.
- Baby's breath.

38:01.012 --> 38:02.531
Which is... Which
is all the stuff

38:02.555 --> 38:03.824
that they put around roses

38:03.848 --> 38:07.109
to make it look all pretty
and romantic and everything.

38:07.268 --> 38:08.861
So you can kind of...

38:09.353 --> 38:11.197
Kind of picture the arrangement.

38:12.023 --> 38:16.827
Red roses, if there were
any in this entire city.

38:17.653 --> 38:19.747
Say a dozen of them.

38:19.864 --> 38:21.550
Or make it a dozen dozen.

38:21.574 --> 38:23.760
Yeah. I get the picture.

38:23.784 --> 38:26.962
And, and I got you this card.

38:28.539 --> 38:29.433
Which is kind of...

38:29.457 --> 38:31.133
- In Spanish.
- Yeah.

38:32.084 --> 38:33.854
Don't tell me. This is all
they had left, right?

38:33.878 --> 38:37.107
And I, I like the
sentiment of it.

38:37.131 --> 38:38.766
I'm all ears.

38:42.220 --> 38:44.188
Which basically means...

38:44.263 --> 38:49.193
love is a many splendored thing.

38:49.310 --> 38:51.788
And high on that
list of splendors,

38:51.812 --> 38:53.582
way high,

38:53.606 --> 38:55.241
is definitely you.

38:57.109 --> 38:59.161
And... Oh, look!

38:59.737 --> 39:02.706
Look, it keeps going
on the back here.

39:03.241 --> 39:06.136
"Because...

39:06.160 --> 39:08.420
"not only are you...

39:08.496 --> 39:10.599
"beautiful... and...

39:10.623 --> 39:13.133
"brilliant and amazing...

39:13.209 --> 39:14.718
but you're also..."

39:15.753 --> 39:17.137
What is this word?

39:18.297 --> 39:19.650
"Forgiving."

39:19.674 --> 39:21.276
Yes.

39:21.300 --> 39:23.143
Very forgiving about...

39:23.678 --> 39:26.897
idiot boyfriends who...
Who take you for granted.

39:27.807 --> 39:33.028
Or who make selfish choices
about monster truck shows.

39:33.688 --> 39:36.365
Well, it actually...
Actually says that.

39:36.524 --> 39:38.669
"And who do stupid things."

39:38.693 --> 39:40.202
Yes.

39:40.695 --> 39:43.581
But only because they're
so afraid of losing you.

39:48.911 --> 39:50.754
<i>"Olé."</i>

39:54.834 --> 39:57.177
So, what do you think?

39:57.545 --> 40:00.347
Do I put these in water
or use them as kindling?

40:07.305 --> 40:08.981
What time is it?

40:09.056 --> 40:10.816
It's 4:30.

40:11.642 --> 40:14.288
I'm meeting Terrell at
the produce market.

40:14.312 --> 40:16.238
We're contracting with
some new suppliers.

40:17.481 --> 40:18.782
Blow it off, Charlie.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.743
Come on.

40:21.694 --> 40:23.203
Come back to bed.

40:23.571 --> 40:25.039
"Blow it off."

40:25.197 --> 40:26.675
That doesn't sound
like you, Kathleen.

40:26.699 --> 40:28.051
I know.

40:28.075 --> 40:29.501
I know.

40:30.703 --> 40:33.098
Because actually, I'd be a
little upset if you left.

40:33.122 --> 40:36.592
Which is... Well, it's
a little weird for me.

40:37.918 --> 40:39.053
I mean...

40:39.253 --> 40:41.732
I'm just so incredibly touched

40:41.756 --> 40:44.183
by what you did these
last two days.

40:44.467 --> 40:46.310
Yes, it... It was really great.

40:47.928 --> 40:50.481
And I guess I'm just
not used to that.

40:50.848 --> 40:52.775
You know, being,

40:52.933 --> 40:54.735
taken care of that way.

40:57.480 --> 41:00.199
So it's... It's a nice
feeling is all, and I just,

41:01.317 --> 41:03.202
don't want it to go away.

41:10.951 --> 41:13.545
Except, well, it...

41:14.663 --> 41:17.633
It's more than that,
really, because,

41:19.418 --> 41:21.762
See, I could fall
in love with you.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.853
Charlie? Say something?

41:31.514 --> 41:33.357
I think you're great too.

41:34.183 --> 41:35.776
Really.

41:37.269 --> 41:38.821
And...

41:39.271 --> 41:40.499
I'll call you after I'm done.

41:40.523 --> 41:42.032
Okay?

41:53.911 --> 41:55.212
Hey.

41:56.747 --> 41:58.016
Isn't it the guy

41:58.040 --> 41:59.800
who's supposed to come
to the window at dawn?

42:01.043 --> 42:03.554
Or did you decide to take
me up on my proposal?

42:03.712 --> 42:06.390
I mean, I'm sorry.
Proposal for a proposal.

42:08.259 --> 42:09.685
No.

42:09.760 --> 42:11.228
No.

42:14.223 --> 42:16.024
See...

42:16.475 --> 42:18.152
Julia.

42:18.853 --> 42:21.321
It's just been a weird week.

42:21.730 --> 42:26.201
You know? I mean, first
Griffin came and...

42:27.111 --> 42:28.797
And all that.

42:28.821 --> 42:30.164
And...

42:31.949 --> 42:33.969
I don't know. I guess I
was just too distracted

42:33.993 --> 42:36.378
to notice the time going by.

42:37.621 --> 42:40.466
Because it's happened before.

42:40.541 --> 42:42.009
I mean,

42:42.668 --> 42:44.386
I've been late before.

42:46.922 --> 42:49.693
And there wasn't any
reason to worry, really.

42:49.717 --> 42:51.560
Because we've been
really careful.

42:53.095 --> 42:55.856
I didn't want to take any
chances, so I went and...

42:56.307 --> 42:59.276
I got one of those
little test kits.

43:00.394 --> 43:01.862
And...

43:05.357 --> 43:07.868
Justin, the test,

43:09.528 --> 43:11.371
came out blue.

43:13.324 --> 43:14.593
What?

43:14.617 --> 43:15.751
That's positive.

43:19.914 --> 43:23.008
The test came out positive.

43:29.715 --> 43:31.642
Oh, Justin.
