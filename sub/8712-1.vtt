00:41.808 --> 00:45.437
- [Man] Hey, Mr. Bartender!
- [Man Chuckles]

00:45.512 --> 00:47.070
I'll see you.

00:47.147 --> 00:49.615
- [Man] Come here, darlin'!!
- Read 'em.

00:49.682 --> 00:51.616
- [Man] Sheriff.
- [Woman] Evening, Sheriff.

00:51.684 --> 00:54.346

- Lyin' cheat!

00:54.421 --> 00:56.446
[Man]
Oh, my God!

01:01.995 --> 01:04.759
Mama, it's getting late.

01:07.534 --> 01:09.525
Come here by Mama.

01:13.673 --> 01:15.607
Do you think...

01:15.675 --> 01:18.405
Pa and Kathy are watching over us?

01:18.478 --> 01:21.470
Yes, sweetheart, I do.

01:22.849 --> 01:26.512
Is there anything you want
to say to them before we go?

01:26.586 --> 01:31.319
I love you,
and I miss you every day.

01:34.627 --> 01:38.119
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll be there in a minute. Okay?

01:49.309 --> 01:52.642
It seems wrong
to leave you here, Willie.

01:54.347 --> 01:57.839
And I know that you and Kathy
will look after each other.

01:59.052 --> 02:01.714
And no matter how far away I am...

02:01.788 --> 02:04.780
you will always be in my heart.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.783
I'll see you again.

02:34.821 --> 02:37.813
Pa and I are going to Pennsylvania
to see my sister and her husband.

02:37.891 --> 02:40.826
- Who are you going to visit?
- We're not visiting anyone.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.761
We're going to live
with my grandpa and grandma.

02:43.830 --> 02:45.855
You're leaving home?

02:45.932 --> 02:48.867
My pa was the sheriff
of Tettsford Junction.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.369
He got himself killed
a couple years back.

02:51.437 --> 02:54.133
Gosh, I'm sorry to hear that.

03:22.001 --> 03:23.969
[Missie]
Oh, look, Maddy.

03:32.545 --> 03:35.105
Hyah!
[Man Shouting]

03:35.181 --> 03:37.342
Hyah!

03:37.417 --> 03:40.011
- [Dogs Barking]
- Whoa!

03:40.086 --> 03:42.281
- Whoa!
- Maddy!

03:42.355 --> 03:44.289
[Missie]
Hey, Pa!

03:44.357 --> 03:47.815
- I missed you!
- Oh, I missed you so much!

03:47.894 --> 03:50.522
- Come here, young man!
- Grandpa!

04:02.041 --> 04:05.499
[Missie Giggles]

04:06.613 --> 04:08.604
[Horse Whinnies]

04:10.383 --> 04:12.817
Grandma!

04:12.885 --> 04:17.288
My, my, my, Maddy.
How you have grown.

04:17.357 --> 04:20.690
And looking more like your father
with every year.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.853
Do you really think so, Grandma?

04:22.929 --> 04:24.863
I really do, sweetie.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.865
I bet you're hot and thirsty.

04:26.933 --> 04:29.800
- There's fresh-churned buttermilk inside.
- All right!

04:34.374 --> 04:36.308
Welcome home, Missie.

04:36.376 --> 04:40.073
It's good to be home, Mama.
I just wish...

04:40.146 --> 04:43.309
I know. I know.

04:44.617 --> 04:47.711
Let's see what you do now.
Your move.

04:47.787 --> 04:50.847
- Yeah, right. King me!
- [Laughing]

04:50.923 --> 04:53.858
- Somebody's been practicing.
- Yes, I have.

04:53.926 --> 04:56.360
Your father found you a house in town.

04:56.429 --> 04:58.363
It's small and it needs some work...

04:58.431 --> 05:00.865
but it's near the school
and the rent is reasonable.

05:00.933 --> 05:04.369
Good. On my teacher's pay
I can't afford much.

05:04.437 --> 05:07.372
I really wish you'd reconsider
staying with us...

05:07.440 --> 05:09.374
at least for a little while.

05:09.442 --> 05:11.501
- Do you need the help, Mama?
- No.

05:11.577 --> 05:15.104
I really appreciate you and Papa
wanting to help me and Maddy.

05:15.181 --> 05:18.116
But I need to stand
on my own two feet right now.

05:18.184 --> 05:21.119
Maddy needs to see that
even though his daddy's gone...

05:21.187 --> 05:24.850
he still has one parent
strong enough to take care of him.

05:26.526 --> 05:28.721
The other day...

05:28.795 --> 05:31.696
Maddy asked me what color
his father's eyes were.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.755
He couldn't remember.

05:35.902 --> 05:38.962
Maddy might forget details like that...

05:39.038 --> 05:43.270
but he won't forget the things his father did
with him or the things Willie taught him.

05:43.343 --> 05:47.177
I'm starting to forget little things
about Willie too.

05:49.048 --> 05:52.575
Like that last morning
when we said good-bye.

05:52.652 --> 05:56.520
Did I kiss him? I think I did,
but I don't remember.

05:56.589 --> 05:59.149
It's only been three years, Mama.

05:59.225 --> 06:03.184
Just like with Maddy, you'll remember
the things that mattered...

06:03.262 --> 06:06.254
like how much you and Willie
loved each other.

06:06.332 --> 06:09.790
No one will ever love me that way again.

06:09.869 --> 06:12.736
And I will never love anyone else.

06:14.340 --> 06:17.104
I can't imagine being truly happy again.

06:20.813 --> 06:23.805
That's how I felt
when my first husband died.

06:25.551 --> 06:27.849
And then I met your father.

06:27.920 --> 06:31.185
See, I feel if I were
to love someone else...

06:31.257 --> 06:34.283
that I would be betraying Willie
in some way.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.329
Willie would want you to be happy.

06:50.143 --> 06:53.044
Whoa. Whoa.

06:53.112 --> 06:56.240
It's gonna take a bit of work,
but I can help you out with that, Missie.

06:56.315 --> 06:58.783
That's all right, Pa.
It's gonna be just fine.

07:02.688 --> 07:06.283
Maddy. Look what I found.

07:06.359 --> 07:08.350
It's our Christmas star.

07:13.699 --> 07:17.863
I promise you, Maddy,
I will make this into a nice place.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.734
It won't be like home though.

07:19.806 --> 07:22.297
Do you know
what makes a house a home?

07:22.375 --> 07:24.070
No.

07:24.143 --> 07:28.170
Home is where
you'll always have a place...

07:28.247 --> 07:29.976
where you will always feel loved...

07:30.049 --> 07:33.314
and where you will never,
ever be alone.

07:33.386 --> 07:36.844
It might not seem like it now,
Maddy, but...

07:36.923 --> 07:39.483
this place will come to feel like home.

07:44.330 --> 07:46.321
Come here.

07:51.671 --> 07:55.038
[Man]
O Lord, how manifold are your works.

07:55.107 --> 07:57.598
We thank you for the sun and the rain...

07:57.677 --> 07:59.668
which help nourish the crops...

07:59.745 --> 08:02.908
and help them grow into sustenance
for our minds and bodies.

08:02.982 --> 08:05.576
In wisdom you have made them all.
Amen.

08:05.651 --> 08:08.279
- [Congregation] Amen!
- I have an announcement.

08:08.354 --> 08:12.415
I received this notice from
the Children's Aid Society of New York.

08:12.492 --> 08:16.690
And it says,
"Wanted: Homes for children.

08:16.762 --> 08:20.630
"A company of homeless children
from the East will arrive on Friday.

08:20.700 --> 08:23.897
"These children are of various ages
and of both sexes...

08:23.970 --> 08:27.133
"having been thrown
friendless upon the world.

We seek good homes with decent families
who will love them as their own. '

08:31.310 --> 08:36.043
Distribution of these children
will take place right here at the church.

08:36.115 --> 08:40.414
I know I can count on all of you to open
your hearts to these precious children of God.

08:40.486 --> 08:42.477
God bless you all.

08:48.628 --> 08:52.428
- Well, I've heard a lot about you, Missie.
- Oh. All good, I trust.

08:52.498 --> 08:55.092
Your father thinks the world of you.

08:55.167 --> 08:56.657
Seems we're neighbors.

08:56.736 --> 08:59.899

two farms away from your new house.

09:01.874 --> 09:03.432
All right.

- Ah, Mrs. Pettis.

- We'll see ya.
- Bye.

to attend church.

09:22.662 --> 09:24.596
Again.

09:24.664 --> 09:27.360
Well, he's pretty busy
keeping the peace.

09:40.079 --> 09:42.547
We should be going, Mrs. Pettis.

09:45.618 --> 09:49.349
Well, it looks like your husband had a reason
for not showing his face in church as well.

09:50.723 --> 09:53.658
There is much work
to be done on the farm...

09:53.726 --> 09:56.854
and we can't afford hired help.

09:56.929 --> 10:00.626

we don't eat come winter.

10:24.657 --> 10:27.558
- I heard about the new teacher.
- What else have you heard?

10:27.627 --> 10:31.324

and you have a little boy.

- Mmm. Maddy.
- It's all right, Missie. Sure you can.

You spoil him.

Of course I do.
It's my job as a grandma.

Now, Marty, you know you're not
well enough to be chasing after a child.

11:08.934 --> 11:13.735
- I will be soon.
- For now, we're gonna have to
let other people handle that.

11:16.676 --> 11:20.112
Would you consider
taking in one of those children?

11:20.179 --> 11:22.909
Yeah, Mom! Then I'd get
to have a brother or sister!

11:22.982 --> 11:26.440
- No.
- But all my friends have
a bunch of brothers and sisters.

11:26.519 --> 11:29.044
But since Kathy died,
I've had none.

11:36.128 --> 11:37.925
I'm sorry, Mama.

11:37.997 --> 11:40.932

or on the left?

Good day, Mrs. LaHaye.

12:52.471 --> 12:54.405
Oh. Sheriff.

- You gonna take one of these kids?
- No.

12:57.476 --> 13:02.880

I would stop in and see how it was going.

in an influenza epidemic.

when we lost her.

13:37.416 --> 13:39.407
Do you think that we could...

13:43.689 --> 13:46.954
May we take Alice aside
and get acquainted with her, Pastor?

13:47.026 --> 13:48.960
You certainly may.

- We need a boy.
- The boy's too young. And scrawny.

could handle herself on a farm.

We'll take him. He looks like
he'll grow into a good farm hand.

15:28.059 --> 15:32.996
- That isn't the point, Hank.
- I thought the point was to find homes
for these young 'uns.

15:33.064 --> 15:36.056
Anyone else here want 'em?

15:36.134 --> 15:41.572
If he comes with us, he gets
a decent home with plenty of good food.

15:41.639 --> 15:43.869
And I'll see he comes to church.

The choice is yours, Jacob.
You don't have to go with them.

I'll treat you kindly.

17:23.508 --> 17:25.066
Okay?

17:26.978 --> 17:29.378
I'll take that as a yes.

17:40.291 --> 17:42.452
Welcome to your new home.

17:49.667 --> 17:53.103
Maddy? This is Belinda Marshall.

17:53.171 --> 17:56.163
- She's going to be living with us.
- For how long?

17:56.240 --> 17:58.674
Just till I'm old enough to leave.
Not a day longer.

17:58.743 --> 18:04.147
Let's just say for the foreseeable future
and leave it at that for now.

18:04.215 --> 18:07.343
You can put your things over here.

18:07.418 --> 18:10.546
Um, I'll make up a bed over here...

18:10.621 --> 18:13.556
and hang some curtains
around it for privacy.

18:13.624 --> 18:17.390
- I'd rather sleep in the shed.
- Oh, no.

18:17.462 --> 18:22.058
It's too dirty, and there's lots
of broken-down old furniture and stuff.

18:22.133 --> 18:24.567
I don't care. I'll fix it up myself.

18:25.903 --> 18:28.599
Maddy, will you go over
to Mrs. Hudson's...

18:28.673 --> 18:33.167
and ask her if we can borrow
her spare mattress just for a while?

18:34.979 --> 18:38.244
[Door Opens, Closes]

18:38.316 --> 18:41.251
Belinda, I would like for you to stay
in the house with me and Maddy.

18:41.319 --> 18:43.412
- Why?
- Because this is your home now.

18:43.488 --> 18:45.251
Belinda, we're your family.

18:45.323 --> 18:48.417
You're not my family.
I've got a papa back in New York.

18:48.493 --> 18:51.428
He'll be coming for me
soon as he gets a job.

18:51.496 --> 18:54.829
I won't be staying here long,
so don't think I will.

19:06.110 --> 19:08.305
This should do for now.

19:09.313 --> 19:12.111
At least until it turns cold.

19:16.687 --> 19:18.780
Is that your family Bible?

19:20.625 --> 19:22.593
Something your parents gave you?

19:22.660 --> 19:24.594
No.

19:24.662 --> 19:26.857
We each got one at the orphanage.

19:26.931 --> 19:28.728
Have you read much of it?

19:30.434 --> 19:33.369
Maybe we could read a passage
tonight after supper.

19:33.437 --> 19:35.132
No.

19:35.206 --> 19:38.642
- What grade are you in, Belinda?
- No grade.

19:38.709 --> 19:42.770
I mean, in New York
what's the last grade that you finished?

19:42.847 --> 19:46.408
- First.
- That's as far as you've gotten in school?

19:46.484 --> 19:49.942
I had work to do.
There was no time for school.

19:50.021 --> 19:54.481
Belinda, can you read?

19:54.559 --> 19:59.223
[Grunts]
What if I can't? Doesn't matter.

19:59.297 --> 20:03.893
Don't need to know how to read to sweep
a floor or bake biscuits or wash clothes.

20:03.968 --> 20:06.436
But books open up a whole world to you.

20:06.504 --> 20:10.600
They teach you things like how much
an African elephant weighs...

20:10.675 --> 20:13.906
or how Betsy Ross came
to make the first flag.

20:13.978 --> 20:16.071
Why would I need to know
any of those things?

20:16.147 --> 20:19.014
It's not just facts and history.

20:19.083 --> 20:22.018
There are stories
that touch your heart...

20:22.086 --> 20:24.179
and make your imagination soar.

20:24.255 --> 20:26.189
Books can take you anywhere.

20:26.257 --> 20:30.956
You could, uh, go to China
or be in the court of Queen Elizabeth.

20:31.028 --> 20:32.962
I'm going outside.

20:34.999 --> 20:36.990
[Door Closes]

20:40.137 --> 20:42.162
Grandma! Grandpa!

20:42.239 --> 20:45.106
- Hey! [Chuckling]
- Hey, sweetheart.

20:47.178 --> 20:50.113
[Clark]
Hey there.

20:50.181 --> 20:54.277
Mama, Papa, this is Belinda.

20:54.352 --> 20:56.547
Welcome to the family, Belinda.

20:56.621 --> 20:59.556
We hope that you'll come to think of us
as your grandparents.

20:59.624 --> 21:03.560
- I'm not your granddaughter.
- We're not trying to take the place
of your grandparents.

21:03.628 --> 21:06.961
We just think a child can't have
too many people who love her.

21:07.031 --> 21:09.124
Do you have grandparents
back in New York?

21:09.200 --> 21:11.634
No. And I don't need none either.

21:17.241 --> 21:20.210
Well, I think it's just about time
to sit down to supper.

21:31.322 --> 21:33.085
- Belinda.
- What?

21:33.157 --> 21:35.091
We say grace first, Belinda.

21:35.159 --> 21:37.093
Do you know what that is?

21:37.161 --> 21:40.995
Of course I do. We had to pray
over our food at the orphanage.

21:41.065 --> 21:44.398
- I don't know why.
- [Clark] Well, it's important.

21:44.468 --> 21:47.835
We're very fortunate.
A lot of people go hungry.

21:47.905 --> 21:51.068
Bet I know that
a lot better than you do.

21:53.077 --> 21:56.444
Let's bow our heads and pray.

21:56.514 --> 22:00.951
Dear Lord, we thank you
for everything that you've given us...

22:01.018 --> 22:04.454
especially for the new member
of our family...

22:04.522 --> 22:06.456
Belinda.

22:06.524 --> 22:09.015
- Amen.
- Amen.

22:12.096 --> 22:14.155
- Amen.
- Yeah!

22:14.231 --> 22:17.132
Let's go!

22:17.201 --> 22:21.297
We're gonna go play with the puppies
down in the barn. Do you wanna come?

22:21.372 --> 22:23.237
No.

22:23.307 --> 22:26.572
If you change your mind,
you're more than welcome to join us.

22:26.644 --> 22:29.112
Getting big there, boy.

22:29.180 --> 22:32.411
- Come here.
- I'll beat you to the barn!

22:33.718 --> 22:36.118
[Door Opens]

22:37.988 --> 22:40.354
[Sighs]
For the life of me...

22:40.424 --> 22:43.450
I don't know what possessed me
to take in that child.

22:43.527 --> 22:46.963
I sure didn't need
any more responsibility.

22:47.031 --> 22:49.022
Then why did you?

22:49.100 --> 22:51.159
Well, I didn't intend to.

22:51.235 --> 22:56.730
But when I rode past the church that day,
something stopped me.

22:56.807 --> 23:01.267
Then when I heard Pastor Joe say,
"Will someone take this child? '

23:01.345 --> 23:05.509
It was as if another voice
came out of me saying, "I will."

23:05.583 --> 23:08.814
Maybe it was another's voice.

23:08.886 --> 23:11.150
You think God was speaking through me?

23:11.222 --> 23:14.851
I think God knew that Belinda needs you.

23:14.925 --> 23:19.089
And maybe, for some reason that you
don't understand yet, you need her.

23:21.232 --> 23:25.464
[Maddy]
Look at her play! She's so cute!

23:26.537 --> 23:29.131
- I think he makes a nice hat.
- Snowball!

23:29.206 --> 23:31.140
- There you go.
- [Giggling]

24:32.069 --> 24:35.903
[Hank] Come here, boy!
Come over here! Get over here!

24:35.973 --> 24:38.066
I told you.

24:38.142 --> 24:41.077
[Hank]
You tryin'to get away?

24:41.145 --> 24:43.739
Is that it?
You tryin'to get away?

24:43.814 --> 24:47.750
Answer me, boy! Come here, boy!
Better get over here!

24:47.818 --> 24:51.584
You think you can just run away
'cause you don't like your chores?

24:51.655 --> 24:55.386
Huh? I can make you work
as hard as I want!

24:55.459 --> 25:00.226
- Get in there! Take your punishment!
- Ow! Ow! Why?

25:43.507 --> 25:45.441
That's rising nicely.

25:45.509 --> 25:48.808
If I get the berries,
can I use your oven to bake some pies?

25:48.879 --> 25:51.211
Pies? Of course.

25:51.282 --> 25:53.910
Is that one of your favorites, berry pie?

25:53.984 --> 25:56.043
Not mine.

25:56.120 --> 25:58.145
My mother's.

25:58.222 --> 26:00.213
[Dog Barking]

26:02.192 --> 26:04.524
Belinda's gonna bake us some fruit pie.

26:04.595 --> 26:06.586
That's nice.

26:08.866 --> 26:13.803
- What's the matter, Clark?
- I gotta take care of somethin'
for the Fletcher widow.

26:19.109 --> 26:20.838
Go back inside, Belinda.

26:20.911 --> 26:23.641
- What are you gonna do?
- What I have to.

26:23.714 --> 26:26.945
- I'm coming with you.
- Fletcher widow's horse broke loose.

26:27.017 --> 26:30.885
He fell in a gully and broke his leg.
She asked me to put him down for her.

26:30.955 --> 26:33.890
- You're gonna shoot an innocent animal?
- Because it needs doing.

26:33.958 --> 26:36.620
Now please, go back inside.

26:46.670 --> 26:51.107
What if the horse's leg can be fixed?
Shouldn't you at least try?

26:51.175 --> 26:54.611
Why is everybody so cruel?
Why doesn't God stop you?

26:54.678 --> 26:57.613
- Please don't kill it! Please!
- Child, listen to me.

26:57.681 --> 27:00.616
I'll check his leg.
If I can save his life, I will.

27:00.684 --> 27:05.644
But if the bone is shattered, would you rather
I leave him to be eaten alive by coyotes?

27:09.426 --> 27:11.417
Wait here, child.

27:21.705 --> 27:26.005
[Snorting]

27:38.155 --> 27:41.056
[Rifle Cocks]

27:42.659 --> 27:44.991
[Gunshot]

28:00.511 --> 28:03.139
Belinda, your food is getting cold.

28:06.817 --> 28:08.808
[Whispers]
What's the matter?

28:16.727 --> 28:18.718
Can I?

28:33.977 --> 28:35.968
Lindy?

28:38.582 --> 28:40.573
I brought you some food.

28:52.830 --> 28:55.025
- Maddy?
- Yes?

28:56.100 --> 28:57.931
Thank you.

28:58.001 --> 29:00.469
You're welcome.

29:16.786 --> 29:19.482
Do you think there's enough berries
for a pie?

29:19.556 --> 29:21.990
Not hardly.
Don't you know nothing?

29:22.058 --> 29:26.017
I know a bunch of things.
I just don't know how to make a pie.

29:26.096 --> 29:30.157
We need a lot more berries.
So quit talking and start picking.

29:30.233 --> 29:33.794
Which ones are the better,
the squishy ones or the hard ones?

29:34.871 --> 29:36.805
- [Groaning]
- Maddy!

29:36.873 --> 29:39.034
[Groaning]
Help!

29:39.109 --> 29:41.134
Maddy!

29:43.313 --> 29:45.804
Maddy, are you okay?
Oh, my gosh.

29:45.882 --> 29:48.510
No. My arm hurts real bad.

29:48.585 --> 29:52.180
We have to get you into town.
Can you stand? Can you stand up?

29:52.255 --> 29:54.587
[Groaning]

30:08.972 --> 30:10.906
- What happened?
- I fell.

30:10.974 --> 30:12.908
I can see that.

30:12.976 --> 30:14.967
Here.

30:16.513 --> 30:20.176
Let's take you over to Mrs. LaHaye's.

30:30.293 --> 30:32.227
What happened?

30:32.295 --> 30:34.058
Maddy, are you okay?

30:34.130 --> 30:35.927
Apparently, he fell.

30:35.999 --> 30:38.467
I tore my clothes. I'm sorry, Mama.

30:38.535 --> 30:40.469
It's all right, sweetheart.

30:40.537 --> 30:43.768
- Will you take him inside?
- Sure. Come on, little fella.

30:49.212 --> 30:51.476
Come along, Belinda.

30:55.385 --> 30:59.321
I don't think it's too bad.
It bled a lot, but it's not broken.

30:59.389 --> 31:01.584
- Thank you, Sheriff.
- I didn't do anything.

31:01.658 --> 31:03.626
She managed to get him into town.

31:03.693 --> 31:06.287
Thank you, Belinda.

31:06.362 --> 31:09.820
I'll go get a towel
and a bowl of water.

31:11.768 --> 31:14.100
Sweetheart, does it hurt?

31:14.170 --> 31:16.035
Yeah.

31:18.041 --> 31:19.633
What is it?

31:19.709 --> 31:21.700
Nothing.

31:23.346 --> 31:25.746
I'd best be going.

31:29.385 --> 31:32.081
[Sighs]
You're a very brave boy.

31:36.993 --> 31:39.928
Missie told me about
how you took care of Maddy.

31:39.996 --> 31:42.487
How did you know how
to get the bleeding to stop?

31:42.565 --> 31:45.227
My mama taught me stuff.

31:45.301 --> 31:50.068
She used to be a midwife,
so she knew all about fixing people.

31:50.139 --> 31:53.438
At the orphanage there were
300 kids and only one nurse...

31:53.509 --> 31:56.137
so I helped out.

31:56.212 --> 31:58.146
Did you like doing that?

31:58.214 --> 32:00.148
Yeah.

32:00.216 --> 32:02.480
It made me feel good.

32:02.552 --> 32:04.850
Have you ever thought about
becoming a nurse?

32:04.921 --> 32:08.857
Me, a nurse? I don't think so.

32:08.925 --> 32:10.984
Why not?

32:11.060 --> 32:14.223
Someone like me
can't do something like that.

32:14.297 --> 32:16.857
What do you mean, someone like you?

32:16.933 --> 32:18.867
You know.

32:18.935 --> 32:20.869
Poor.

32:20.937 --> 32:24.065
Plain old poverty can't keep you from
doing something you really want to do.

32:26.009 --> 32:28.136
Only poverty of spirit can do that.

32:30.179 --> 32:33.410
My mama always wanted to be a nurse.

32:33.483 --> 32:35.417
She never got the chance to.

32:35.485 --> 32:38.818
Your mama was never able
to pursue her dream.

32:38.888 --> 32:42.380
I think she'd be very proud if you were
able to do something she couldn't.

32:48.097 --> 32:50.793
No matter how early we leave,
we are always running late.

32:50.867 --> 32:52.858
Is that why we're always running?

32:54.270 --> 32:55.999
What's the matter with you, boy?

32:56.072 --> 32:58.905
We ain't got money
to go wasting on your clumsiness!

32:58.975 --> 33:01.944
- Hello, Mr. Pettis.
- Mrs. LaHaye.

33:02.011 --> 33:04.707
Jacob only tripped.
It was an accident.

33:04.781 --> 33:09.582
Money's tight, Mrs. LaHaye. Couple more
"accidents" might well put me in the poorhouse.

33:09.652 --> 33:13.088
And you might want to keep an eye
on your own young 'uns.

33:13.156 --> 33:15.147
Let's go.

33:21.097 --> 33:23.827

33:40.383 --> 33:42.408

Can I play?

33:42.485 --> 33:45.113
- Course not.
- Why not?

33:45.188 --> 33:47.986
Nobody likes you.
That's why.

33:48.057 --> 33:49.922
You're just a no-account orphan.

33:49.992 --> 33:53.428
You take that back, liar!
[Grunting]

33:54.397 --> 33:56.957
All right. That's enough.

33:57.033 --> 33:59.797
- [Grunts]
- Get up.

33:59.869 --> 34:01.928
I said, that's enough.

34:04.874 --> 34:07.866
Now, someone wanna tell me
what happened here?

34:10.847 --> 34:13.782
How about you and I
go over here and talk?

34:13.850 --> 34:16.114
It wasn't my fault!
I didn't start it!

34:17.954 --> 34:21.889
I know that Stevens boy well enough to be
pretty sure he did or said something mean.

34:21.958 --> 34:25.155
- You wanna tell me what that was?
- [Children Shouting]

34:25.228 --> 34:28.254
Must have been pretty bad
if you don't wanna say.

34:28.331 --> 34:30.264
He just...
[Sighs]

34:30.333 --> 34:32.824
He wouldn't let me play, is all.

34:34.337 --> 34:36.804
It's hard being the outsider.

34:36.873 --> 34:40.206
I imagine your whole life's pretty hard
right now. But you can't give up.

34:40.275 --> 34:42.369
I can run faster than all of them.

34:42.445 --> 34:45.710
I bet you can. Why don't you
go back there and show 'em? Go on.

34:47.583 --> 34:50.245
- [Boy] Go!
- [Shouting, Chattering]

34:51.687 --> 34:54.087
I can outrun any of you.

34:54.157 --> 34:57.092
No, you can't. You're a girl.

34:57.160 --> 35:00.459
Yeah, and you're a stupid bully,
but I can still outrun you.

35:00.530 --> 35:04.022
You wanna get beat bad?
Come on in.

35:05.034 --> 35:07.969
Once around the old oak.

35:08.037 --> 35:10.870
Ready? Set? Go!

35:10.940 --> 35:14.068
- Come on!
- [All Shouting]

35:27.089 --> 35:30.581
[Shouting Continues]

35:32.395 --> 35:35.387
[Cheering, Shouting]

35:39.635 --> 35:42.365
Recess is over.
Everybody back inside.

35:42.438 --> 35:46.067
- Next time I want you on my team. Okay?
- Good job.

35:57.453 --> 36:01.685
Why do I get the feeling that something
just happened and you were a part of it?

36:02.758 --> 36:05.226
Nothing I couldn't handle, ma'am.

36:05.294 --> 36:07.888
If I were you,
I'd keep an eye on that Belinda.

36:07.964 --> 36:10.956
If she does run,
you're not gonna catch her.

36:22.512 --> 36:26.278
[Thunder Rumbling]

36:43.132 --> 36:46.727
- [Man] Hey, Mr. Bartender!
- [Man Chuckles]

36:46.802 --> 36:49.327
I'll see you.

36:49.405 --> 36:50.997
- [Man] Come here, darlin'!!
- Read 'em.

36:51.073 --> 36:52.938
- [Man] Sheriff.
- [Woman] Evening, Sheriff.

36:53.009 --> 36:55.239
- Pleasure doin' business with ya...
- Lyin' cheat!

36:55.311 --> 36:58.246
- [Gunshot]
- [Gasps, Panting]

36:58.314 --> 37:01.249
[Thunder Continues Rumbling]

37:34.717 --> 37:38.016
[Thunderclap,
Thunder Continues Rumbling]

38:27.470 --> 38:29.461
I brought food.

38:34.243 --> 38:37.576
- It smells really good.
- You gotta hide it from 'em.

38:37.647 --> 38:40.241
I'll put it under my bed.

38:40.316 --> 38:42.841
I'll try to bring something better
tomorrow night.

38:42.918 --> 38:46.911
I hate it here, Lindy.
He hits me, and she yells at me.

38:46.989 --> 38:51.323
I don't want to stay.
Can't I come live with you?

38:51.394 --> 38:54.386
I don't know how Mrs. LaHaye
would feel about that.

38:54.463 --> 38:57.398
And even if she were okay with it...

38:57.466 --> 39:00.401
Mr. And Mrs. Pettis probably
wouldn't let her take you.

39:00.469 --> 39:02.334
I miss you somethin' awful.

39:02.405 --> 39:04.532
Let's run away from here right now.

39:04.607 --> 39:07.007
Jacob, you know we can't leave.

39:07.076 --> 39:09.135
Even if we could leave...

39:09.211 --> 39:11.771
how would Papa find us?

39:11.847 --> 39:16.307
Least this way, the orphanage
can tell him we were sent here.

39:16.385 --> 39:19.218
I promise I'll get you out of here, Jacob.

39:19.288 --> 39:21.950
It just can't be tonight.

39:23.059 --> 39:24.993
You're gonna leave me again?

39:25.061 --> 39:28.155
I'll never leave you
longer than I have to.

39:28.230 --> 39:31.427
I'll be back tomorrow. Okay?

40:31.961 --> 40:35.158
At least you're safe, thank God.

40:38.200 --> 40:41.863
Look, it is late
and we are both exhausted...

40:41.937 --> 40:44.462
so we will talk about this
in the morning.

40:47.543 --> 40:50.512
Now go to bed, Belinda.

41:04.727 --> 41:08.595
Last night wasn't the first time
you sneaked out, was it?

41:12.168 --> 41:17.003
I want to know where you went
and why you stole food.

41:21.744 --> 41:25.077
Members of a family
need to trust each other.

41:25.147 --> 41:27.945
- So?
- I don't understand.

41:28.017 --> 41:29.951
What do you want?

41:31.353 --> 41:33.412
I have to stay here.

41:33.489 --> 41:36.049
If you don't want me,
I can find work somewhere.

41:36.125 --> 41:39.288
I'm a hard worker.
All I ask for is food and a bed.

41:39.361 --> 41:41.295
Belinda, I want you.

41:41.363 --> 41:43.831
My family wants you.

41:43.899 --> 41:48.927
And I'm not gonna send you to work
when you should go to school and be a child.

41:49.004 --> 41:52.872
I ain't been a child for a long time.

42:03.953 --> 42:06.080
I'm worried about her safety.

42:06.155 --> 42:10.751
I'll keep a close watch over her, of course,
but I can't stay up all night, every night.

42:10.826 --> 42:13.761
And if she's determined to sneak out,
she's going to just do it.

42:13.829 --> 42:17.094
Instead of trying to stop something
you can't stop, just let her go and...

42:17.166 --> 42:20.727
- Let her go? Have you lost your mind?
- You didn't let me finish.

42:20.803 --> 42:23.237
Let her go and follow her.
See what this is all about.

42:23.305 --> 42:26.968
It may be nothing. She could be sneaking out
just to prove she doesn't have to stay with you.

42:27.042 --> 42:29.476
- Or...
- Or it could be something serious.

42:29.545 --> 42:31.274
Something dangerous, even.

42:31.347 --> 42:33.338
There's only one way to find out.

43:18.927 --> 43:21.725
- [Gasps]
- Shh.

43:21.797 --> 43:23.731
[Whispering]
What are you doing here?

43:23.799 --> 43:27.291
Same thing you are. Finding out
what that little girl's doing.

43:44.419 --> 43:47.217
Brought peaches.

43:47.289 --> 43:50.725
Oh, boy. Ain't had nothing
like this in a long time.

43:50.792 --> 43:53.989
- How are you doing?
- He hit me again.

43:54.062 --> 43:56.496
I didn't do nothin'.

43:56.565 --> 44:00.228
I just didn't move fast enough when
Mrs. Pettis told me to fetch somethin'.

44:00.302 --> 44:03.100
Jacob, I'll get you out of here
just as soon as I can.

44:03.171 --> 44:05.162
I hope that's soon, Lindy.

44:07.442 --> 44:09.933
Good night, Jacob.

44:19.354 --> 44:21.288
[Door Closes]

44:32.467 --> 44:36.403
Belinda, why have you been
sneaking out to see Jacob?

44:36.471 --> 44:39.463
And why are you bringing him food?

44:40.642 --> 44:42.803
We need the truth now, Belinda.

44:44.212 --> 44:47.978
It'll be better for you to get it all out.

44:48.049 --> 44:50.984
Jacob looked thinner
than when I saw him the last time.

44:51.052 --> 44:53.384
Are Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
treating him right?

44:53.455 --> 44:57.516
- We need the real story.
- It's not a story! It's true!

44:57.592 --> 44:59.617
They're being real mean to Jacob!

44:59.694 --> 45:01.889
What's Jacob's last name?

45:05.233 --> 45:07.827
Is it Marshall?

45:10.138 --> 45:12.265
Is Jacob your brother?

45:17.579 --> 45:21.515
Belinda,
why did you keep this a secret?

45:21.583 --> 45:25.019
At the other towns
the train stopped at...

45:25.086 --> 45:28.112
I saw brothers and sisters
having a real hard time.

45:30.258 --> 45:32.283
Most folks only want one kid.

45:32.360 --> 45:35.727
And others feel bad
about breaking up families...

45:35.797 --> 45:37.788
so they don't take any kid.

45:39.668 --> 45:42.296
I would have taken both of you,
Belinda.

45:42.370 --> 45:46.932
You say that now, but you know you
wouldn't have wanted more than one kid.

45:48.576 --> 45:51.511
[Sighs]
Jacob had a better chance on his own.

45:51.579 --> 45:53.342
Why?

45:53.415 --> 45:55.349
'Cause he's younger.

45:55.417 --> 45:58.682
Folks want younger kids.

45:58.753 --> 46:03.213
Once you get to be around my age,
it's harder to find people that'll take 'em.

46:03.291 --> 46:06.454
You need to go to bed.

46:07.629 --> 46:10.564
But I promise you, Belinda...

46:10.632 --> 46:13.999
we will go over there first thing
tomorrow morning and I will talk...

46:14.069 --> 46:17.061
Mrs. LaHaye, may I speak to you
outside, please?

46:19.140 --> 46:21.131
Go to bed.

46:28.316 --> 46:31.752
Why did you stop me? I was going to tell her
that we'll go get her brother out of there.

46:31.820 --> 46:34.755
That's why I stopped you.
I didn't want to get her hopes up.

46:34.823 --> 46:37.758
So you think that I won't do what I said?

46:37.826 --> 46:40.761
No. I know you'll try to do
exactly what you said.

46:40.829 --> 46:44.390
But when Mr. And Mrs. Pettis took Jacob,
they got legal guardianship.

46:44.466 --> 46:47.663
And unless we can prove that he's being
seriously hurt, no court will interfere.

46:47.736 --> 46:50.933
- So you're not going to do anything?
- I'll check the situation out.

46:51.006 --> 46:53.236
But I gotta be careful how I handle this.

46:53.308 --> 46:57.745
- I don't wanna make Hank so mad
that he takes it out on Jacob.
- Well, I'm going with you.

46:57.812 --> 47:00.212
- No, you're not.
- You can't stop me.

47:00.281 --> 47:02.647
[Sighs]

47:02.717 --> 47:04.844
You be in my office at 8:00 sharp.

47:04.919 --> 47:07.444
- I won't wait a minute longer.
- I'll be there.

47:30.245 --> 47:32.179
[Whispering]
Belinda Marshall...

47:32.247 --> 47:34.306
you are an amazing girl...

47:35.750 --> 47:37.741
and I love you very much.

47:51.833 --> 47:53.994
[Tyler]
Just wanna see the boy, Hank.

47:54.069 --> 47:57.004
- [Missie] We know you've been mistreating him.
- You watch your mouth!

47:57.072 --> 48:00.166
Let us see the boy, and we'll leave.

48:00.241 --> 48:02.175
Come on out here, boy.

48:06.714 --> 48:09.410
You just stay right here.

48:09.484 --> 48:12.453
Jacob, I'm Sheriff Tyler,
and this is Mrs. LaHaye.

48:12.520 --> 48:14.283
Lindy's foster mama?

48:14.355 --> 48:18.758
Yes. Your sister's very worried
about you, Jacob.

48:18.827 --> 48:21.955
She believes that Mr. And Mrs. Pettis
aren't feeding you enough...

48:22.030 --> 48:23.827
and that they're working you too hard.

48:23.898 --> 48:26.264
Is that true, Jacob?

48:28.903 --> 48:33.101
- Don't be afraid of him.
We won't let him hurt you.
- Has he laid a hand on you?

48:35.210 --> 48:38.145
Are they feeding you enough?

48:38.213 --> 48:41.671
You said you were going to bring him to church.
Why haven't you done that?

48:41.749 --> 48:45.708
That's enough.
You got your answers, Sheriff. Now git.

48:48.723 --> 48:51.487
Hyah!

48:51.559 --> 48:53.550
Hyah!

48:53.628 --> 48:58.429
- I wanted to ask them why they
aren't sending Jacob to school.
- No law says they have to.

48:58.500 --> 49:00.866
- But...
- Even parents, let alone guardians...

49:00.935 --> 49:03.870
don't have to send their kids to school.

49:03.938 --> 49:05.872
That's just wrong.

49:05.940 --> 49:09.205
Jacob needs an education if he's
going to have any kind of future.

49:09.277 --> 49:11.142
Unless we can persuade Pettis of that...

49:11.212 --> 49:13.203
Jacob's future's on that farm.

49:16.784 --> 49:20.584
You don't understand how desperately
Belinda and Jacob love each other...

49:20.655 --> 49:24.147
what it means to be separated
from someone you love that deeply.

49:24.225 --> 49:27.194
I don't think you've ever felt that way
about anyone in your life...

49:27.262 --> 49:30.254
or else you wouldn't let that happen.

49:36.504 --> 49:38.631
- Whoa!
- [Horse Whinnies]

49:40.175 --> 49:43.372
Did you see Jacob? Is he okay?
Is he gonna come live here?

49:43.444 --> 49:45.378
Belinda, I'm sorry.

49:45.446 --> 49:50.611
Sheriff Tyler and I talked to Mr. Pettis,
but Jacob’s gonna have to stay there for now.

49:50.685 --> 49:55.122
Our papa's gonna come for us, and he's gonna
get Jacob away from that terrible man!

49:55.190 --> 49:58.887
And he's gonna take
both of us home with him!

49:58.960 --> 50:01.121
[Door Slams]

50:06.701 --> 50:11.400
For those of you in the second-grade primer,
please open your books to page 13.

50:11.472 --> 50:14.737
For the rest of you, you can continue
doing your multiplication tables.

50:16.277 --> 50:18.074
Belinda.

50:18.146 --> 50:20.580
Will you open your book to page 13?

50:20.648 --> 50:22.639
I would like for you to read aloud.

50:30.692 --> 50:34.753
"The T... Tales...

50:34.829 --> 50:37.161
"Of Pete...

50:42.237 --> 50:44.398
Rabbit.

50:44.472 --> 50:46.406
You're doing very well. Go on.

50:46.474 --> 50:49.238
- I can't read it.
- You could try.

50:49.310 --> 50:50.902
I don't want to!

50:52.347 --> 50:54.281
All right, class.
That's enough for today.

50:54.349 --> 50:57.284
We will pick up tomorrow
where we left off.

50:57.352 --> 50:59.513
You're excused.

51:06.127 --> 51:09.824
She doesn't want to be part of a family.

51:09.897 --> 51:13.628
She really resents me.
Maybe even hates me.

51:13.701 --> 51:17.159
You and I didn't take
to each other at first. Remember?

51:17.238 --> 51:21.174
- And I am so ashamed about how I resented you.
- It's perfectly natural.

51:21.242 --> 51:25.702
You'd lost your mama and didn't want me to
take her place. Just like with your papa and me.

51:25.780 --> 51:28.214
I'd lost my husband
and didn't want Clark to take his place.

51:28.283 --> 51:30.547
But then you fell in love with Papa
and things changed.

51:30.618 --> 51:33.348
I fell in love with both of you.

51:35.957 --> 51:38.892
Belinda has so much anger in her.

51:38.960 --> 51:41.360
She's had it much harder than I did.

51:41.429 --> 51:44.159
Which is exactly why she needs you.

51:44.232 --> 51:47.793
Even if she's not ready to admit it right now,
she needs what you have to give.

51:47.869 --> 51:52.568
But I have so little to give. I can barely keep
enough food on the table for Maddy and me.

51:52.640 --> 51:55.200
Those other parents
that adopted those children...

51:55.276 --> 51:57.210
they have so much to offer.

51:57.278 --> 52:00.213
You will leave Belinda
a legacy of character...

52:00.281 --> 52:02.977
and of a love for others, and of faith.

52:03.051 --> 52:06.316
That's a beautiful legacy.

52:06.387 --> 52:08.753
That's the kind of legacy that lasts.

52:13.394 --> 52:16.329
Well, we've gone through
all the books at school...

52:16.397 --> 52:18.524
and all the books here...

52:18.599 --> 52:22.831
and you can't seem to find anything
that you're interested in.

52:22.904 --> 52:26.271
There must be something
that you want to be able to read.

52:26.341 --> 52:28.332
Well...

52:32.447 --> 52:35.780
when my pa dropped me and Jacob
off at the orphanage...

52:37.118 --> 52:39.279
he pinned this letter to my dress.

52:39.354 --> 52:43.552
- I was supposed to give it to 'em, but I kept it.
- Why?

52:43.624 --> 52:47.219
These are his last words to us.
They're important.

52:48.996 --> 52:52.363
I just know it's gonna say how much
he loved us and wanted to keep us...

52:52.433 --> 52:54.867
and how he'll come back for us someday.

52:56.304 --> 53:00.001
- Will you read it to me?
- Oh...

53:00.074 --> 53:02.474
Belinda, this letter is private.

53:02.543 --> 53:05.068
It's between you children
and your papa.

53:05.146 --> 53:07.546
I can teach you how to read it.

53:07.615 --> 53:10.049
Okay, I'll learn how to read.

53:10.118 --> 53:12.746
But will you just read it to me now?

53:12.820 --> 53:15.448
All right.

53:16.991 --> 53:19.755
"To Whom It May Concern...

53:19.827 --> 53:23.456
"This is to certify

53:52.059 --> 53:55.586
Uh, your father put his mark.

53:55.663 --> 53:57.688
Is that all?

53:58.866 --> 54:01.198
I'm so sorry, Belinda.

54:01.269 --> 54:05.638
I know it must have been very difficult
for your father to give up you and Jacob.

54:13.514 --> 54:16.142
Last one to the swimmin' hole's
a rotten egg!

54:16.217 --> 54:18.685
Thank you.

54:18.753 --> 54:20.687
Thank you.

54:20.755 --> 54:22.586
Thank you.

54:40.775 --> 54:42.709
Mrs. LaHaye, what's wrong?

54:42.777 --> 54:46.213
I lost my locket.
The chain must have broken.

54:46.280 --> 54:49.215
- Is it valuable?
- Yes.

54:49.283 --> 54:54.186
I'm sorry. My mother gave it to me
a long time ago, and it is very dear to me.

54:54.255 --> 54:56.223
Let me help you look for it.

54:56.290 --> 54:58.053
Thank you.

55:05.867 --> 55:07.994
It's starting to get dark out here.

55:08.069 --> 55:10.867
We can look again tomorrow.

55:10.938 --> 55:13.304
There's no point.

Aw, I'm not much of a dancer.

55:43.204 --> 55:47.300
It's not how good you are. It's just an excuse
to wrap your arms around a pretty girl.

55:47.375 --> 55:50.936
[Chattering, Laughing]

55:51.012 --> 55:53.480
Why don't you ask her to dance?

Mrs. LaHaye?

56:59.714 --> 57:03.582
I, um... I got some...

57:03.651 --> 57:07.644
A peddler came through town
the other day, and I got this for you.

57:12.393 --> 57:16.386
I know it won't replace the one your mother
gave you, but maybe it might make you feel better.

57:16.464 --> 57:19.399
Zach, this looks like real gold.

57:19.467 --> 57:22.769
Well, if it isn't, I got taken.

57:22.902 --> 57:26.838
There's enough room for two pictures...
Maddy's and Belinda's.

57:26.906 --> 57:28.897
I can't accept this.

57:28.975 --> 57:32.809
- It's just a gift. It doesn't mean anything.
- That's just it.

57:32.879 --> 57:38.511
I could only accept an expensive gift
like this if it did mean something...

57:39.719 --> 57:42.313
if it came from a man that I love.

57:45.758 --> 57:47.817
Could I be such a man?

No.

[Sniffles]

58:13.486 --> 58:16.478
[Sobbing]
I just never wanted to feel this way again.

58:19.125 --> 58:22.617
It was so much easier
when I didn't feel anything.

58:24.297 --> 58:27.357
Unfortunately, it doesn't seem
like God put us on this Earth...

58:27.433 --> 58:29.697
to have it easy.

58:29.769 --> 58:32.704
But he did put us here
to love one another.

58:38.578 --> 58:41.513
[Sighs]
I'm so ashamed of myself.

58:41.581 --> 58:45.881
I have two children at home to think of,
and I'm acting like a child myself.

58:45.952 --> 58:47.943
You're not acting like a child.

58:49.622 --> 58:51.954
You're acting like a woman in love.

58:52.024 --> 58:54.117
I have to get home to the children.

58:54.193 --> 58:58.323
- If there's anything your father
and I can do to help...
- Thank you, Mama.

59:00.533 --> 59:02.467
Thank you.

59:19.552 --> 59:21.486
Mrs. LaHaye?

59:23.222 --> 59:26.055
There's somethin' l...
I need to tell you.

59:28.227 --> 59:31.594
You asked me a while back
why I care so much about Belinda.

59:33.232 --> 59:35.166
See, she reminds me of someone.

59:35.234 --> 59:37.202
Someone you loved?

59:37.270 --> 59:40.967
Eleanor. Ellie.

59:41.040 --> 59:42.701
We grew up together.

59:42.775 --> 59:45.767
Her daddy was the town drunk.

59:45.845 --> 59:48.177
And when he wasn't passed out...

59:48.247 --> 59:50.477
he was just full of meanness...

59:50.549 --> 59:52.540
and he took it out on her.

59:52.618 --> 59:54.279
Nobody did anything?

59:54.353 --> 59:56.344
No.

59:56.422 --> 01:00:00.552
Then when I finally got big enough,
l... I stood up to him.

01:00:00.626 --> 01:00:05.393
- What happened?
- Well, let's just say he didn't hit her again.

01:00:07.366 --> 01:00:09.357
Did you marry Ellie?

01:00:10.836 --> 01:00:12.861
I was going to.

01:00:14.273 --> 01:00:17.174
- What happened?
- Bank robbery.

01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:23.171
She wasn't a threat in any way.

01:00:24.884 --> 01:00:26.875
They didn't have to kill her.

01:00:28.054 --> 01:00:31.023
But they did, and...
and they got away with it.

01:00:32.358 --> 01:00:34.690
They're alive, and...

01:00:37.496 --> 01:00:39.430
Ellie's dead.

01:00:42.034 --> 01:00:44.264
Just no rhyme or reason to it.

01:00:47.039 --> 01:00:49.234
Zach, I'm so sorry.

01:00:52.378 --> 01:00:55.711
I understand your bitterness
toward God.

01:01:00.486 --> 01:01:02.681
I felt the same way once.

01:01:02.755 --> 01:01:07.419
My husband, Willie, was the sheriff
in the town that we lived in.

01:01:09.328 --> 01:01:11.421
He was killed in the line of duty.

01:01:11.497 --> 01:01:14.022
How did it happen?

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:16.591
It was stupid really.

01:01:16.669 --> 01:01:21.629
- [Man] Darlin'!!
- Couple of men in a saloon got into a fight.

01:01:21.707 --> 01:01:25.199
Willie went in to break it up.

01:01:25.277 --> 01:01:29.145
Should have ended with nothing worse
than a black eye or two and a broken nose...

01:01:29.215 --> 01:01:31.342
but...

01:01:31.417 --> 01:01:34.284
one of the men pulled out a gun.

01:01:34.353 --> 01:01:36.821
[Gunshot]

01:01:36.889 --> 01:01:40.484
He was dead by the time I got there.

01:01:40.559 --> 01:01:43.221
I didn't even have a chance
to say good-bye.

01:01:43.295 --> 01:01:44.990
I'm so sorry, Missie.

01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:49.891
You must have loved him very much.

01:01:49.969 --> 01:01:52.870
With all of my heart and soul.

01:01:57.476 --> 01:02:00.411
[Whinnies]

01:02:02.214 --> 01:02:04.648
We're just about done.

01:02:04.717 --> 01:02:07.880
Sure goes fast
when you're not doing it alone.

01:02:07.953 --> 01:02:10.421
Grandma! Mama! Come quick!

01:02:10.489 --> 01:02:13.390
One of the puppies won't wake up!

01:02:32.411 --> 01:02:36.006
Aw. Poor little thing.

01:02:40.186 --> 01:02:43.849
- Can I hold him for a minute?
- Yeah.

01:02:43.923 --> 01:02:45.857
[Whining]

01:03:10.616 --> 01:03:13.551
[Whimpers]

01:03:15.921 --> 01:03:19.652
You're all right now. You're all right.

01:03:22.061 --> 01:03:26.225
Belinda! How did you do that?

01:03:29.301 --> 01:03:31.235
[Barking]

01:03:32.404 --> 01:03:34.531
Belinda?

01:03:37.343 --> 01:03:39.243
[Sobbing]

01:03:51.357 --> 01:03:54.849
Belinda? Oh, Belinda.

01:03:57.830 --> 01:04:01.288
You just did an amazing thing.
What's the matter?

01:04:03.302 --> 01:04:06.135
Mama didn't only have Jacob and me.

01:04:07.206 --> 01:04:09.936
There was a baby girl.

01:04:10.009 --> 01:04:11.943
Jenny.

01:04:12.945 --> 01:04:14.879
I'm so sorry, honey.

01:04:14.947 --> 01:04:18.110
[Sniffles]
I tried to take care of baby Jenny...

01:04:18.184 --> 01:04:21.347
and to keep her warm
and to get her milk...

01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.480
e-even though we didn't
have much money.

01:04:24.557 --> 01:04:28.186
How old were you, Belinda?

01:04:28.260 --> 01:04:31.058
Eight.

01:04:31.130 --> 01:04:35.396
That is far too big a responsibility
for a little girl.

01:04:36.702 --> 01:04:39.569
There wasn't anyone else to do it.

01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:43.131
What happened to Jenny?

01:04:44.743 --> 01:04:46.734
She got sick...

01:04:49.081 --> 01:04:51.481
and we couldn't afford a doctor.

01:04:51.550 --> 01:04:55.384
So one day she just...

01:04:55.454 --> 01:04:58.321
stopped breathing, and...

01:04:58.390 --> 01:05:03.054
and I tried to do
what Mama told me to do...

01:05:03.128 --> 01:05:05.119
like with the puppy...

01:05:06.131 --> 01:05:08.122
but it didn't work.

01:05:10.035 --> 01:05:12.526
It's all my fault Jenny died!

01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.932
Belinda, listen to me. Sometimes
things happen... terrible things.

01:05:18.010 --> 01:05:20.308
And there is nothing
that we can do about it.

01:05:20.379 --> 01:05:22.973
You don't understand.

01:05:23.048 --> 01:05:26.711
- Yes, I do.
- How can you?

01:05:26.785 --> 01:05:29.015
Because I lost a baby too.

01:05:32.258 --> 01:05:34.658
Her name was Kathy.

01:05:34.727 --> 01:05:37.628
She was so very precious to me.

01:05:38.831 --> 01:05:40.822
What happened to her?

01:05:40.899 --> 01:05:42.890
She just stopped breathing.

01:05:44.403 --> 01:05:46.394
I don't know why.

01:05:46.472 --> 01:05:51.239
One minute she was in her cradle asleep,
and then the next she...

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:54.711
- It wasn't your fault.
- I felt like it was.

01:05:56.215 --> 01:05:59.309
I felt like there must have been
some way that I could save her...

01:05:59.385 --> 01:06:01.580
just like you thought
that you could save Jenny.

01:06:01.654 --> 01:06:03.747
But we couldn't.

01:06:03.822 --> 01:06:05.756
It was out of our hands.

01:06:08.294 --> 01:06:10.285
It was in God's hands.

01:06:14.466 --> 01:06:16.457
I couldn't save Jenny...

01:06:17.569 --> 01:06:20.060
and you couldn't save Kathy.

01:06:21.106 --> 01:06:23.097
But we can save Jacob.

01:06:23.175 --> 01:06:26.110
I'm going to bring
you and Maddy home now.

01:06:26.178 --> 01:06:30.842
- Then what?
- Then I am going to get Jacob.

01:06:34.053 --> 01:06:36.544
- [Boy Shouting]
- [Horse Whinnying]

01:06:37.623 --> 01:06:39.250
Sheriff!

01:06:40.693 --> 01:06:42.684
What is it? Is somethin' wrong?

01:06:42.761 --> 01:06:47.198
I think Mrs. LaHaye may be in trouble,
and it's all my fault. I made her go out there.

01:06:47.266 --> 01:06:50.895
- Go where?
- To get Jacob! But she's all alone,
and that man is so mean.

01:06:50.969 --> 01:06:53.369
- I'm afraid he might hurt her.
- You go on home, Belinda.

01:06:53.439 --> 01:06:55.703
- B-But, Sheriff...
- I'll take care of this.

01:06:55.774 --> 01:06:58.140
But I can't worry about you, too,
so go on home and stay there.

01:06:58.210 --> 01:07:00.041
If anything happens to Mrs. LaHaye...

01:07:00.112 --> 01:07:03.377
Nothing's gonna happen to her.
I won't let it.

01:07:06.151 --> 01:07:08.984
All right.
What is it this time, Mrs. LaHaye?

01:07:09.054 --> 01:07:12.046
- Where's Jacob?
- None of your damn business, that's where.

01:07:12.124 --> 01:07:15.252
Let him come with me.
He needs to be with his sister.

01:07:15.327 --> 01:07:17.454
Surely you can see that, Mr. Pettis.

01:07:17.529 --> 01:07:19.429
All I know is I got a good hand.

01:07:19.498 --> 01:07:21.432
You can hire someone.

01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:24.333
A grown man could do much more work
than that little boy can.

01:07:24.403 --> 01:07:26.997
Men don't work for nothin'.
That boy does.

01:07:27.072 --> 01:07:29.836
Search your heart, Mr. Pettis.

01:07:29.908 --> 01:07:34.106
I know that somewhere deep inside,
you must feel something for him.

01:07:34.179 --> 01:07:37.444
Well, now, that's where you're wrong,
Mrs. LaHaye.

01:07:37.516 --> 01:07:41.008
[Sighs]
You are a cruel and selfish man...

01:07:41.086 --> 01:07:44.419
and I am not going to let Jacob
spend one more day in your power!

01:07:44.490 --> 01:07:47.721
And just what do you think
you can do about it? Huh?

01:07:47.793 --> 01:07:49.852
You come on to my land,
threatening me.

01:07:49.928 --> 01:07:52.123
I'm within my rights
to do whatever I want to you!

01:07:52.197 --> 01:07:54.791
- Even the law can't say otherwise.
- Let go of me!

01:07:54.867 --> 01:07:58.132
- Let her go, Hank!
- Nobody tells me what to do on my own land!

01:07:58.203 --> 01:08:00.535
You let her go.

01:08:00.606 --> 01:08:03.973
[Horse Whinnies]

01:08:04.042 --> 01:08:07.773
You can't arrest me for defending myself
on my own property!

01:08:07.846 --> 01:08:11.213
If we weren't on your property,
you'd be heading to jail right now.

01:08:11.283 --> 01:08:14.309
Either way, you shoot anyone here
or anywhere else, I will arrest you.

01:08:14.386 --> 01:08:17.219
We'll let the courts decide
whether it's right or wrong.

01:08:17.288 --> 01:08:19.621
- Mrs. LaHaye, come on.
- But what about Jacob?

01:08:19.691 --> 01:08:22.683
- Can't do anything about him right now.
- [Sighs]

01:08:31.236 --> 01:08:33.727
[Missie]
Whoa. Whoa.

01:08:33.805 --> 01:08:37.332
He shot at you.
Why didn't you arrest him?

01:08:37.408 --> 01:08:39.399
Well, that was just a warning shot.

01:08:39.478 --> 01:08:41.742
He wanted to hit me,
he would have hit me.

01:08:41.814 --> 01:08:43.839
You were trespassing on his land, Missie.

01:08:43.916 --> 01:08:46.908
By law, you should have
been the one arrested.

01:08:46.984 --> 01:08:49.453
Where's Jacob?

01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.854
I'm sorry, Belinda,
but we couldn't get him away.

01:08:52.925 --> 01:08:55.393
Why not?

01:08:55.461 --> 01:08:57.986
We don't have the legal right.

01:08:58.063 --> 01:09:01.055
- What about Jacob’s rights?
- Look, I am not giving up.

01:09:01.133 --> 01:09:03.363
I promise you
that I will get Jacob back.

01:09:16.113 --> 01:09:18.048
Whoa.

01:09:19.117 --> 01:09:21.448
- Hey, Mama.
- Where's Belinda?

01:09:21.520 --> 01:09:24.819
She came in, grabbed her stuff
and left through the back door.

01:09:24.890 --> 01:09:27.756
Oh, no. Stay here.

01:09:33.265 --> 01:09:35.198
Belinda?

01:09:35.267 --> 01:09:37.201
Belinda?

01:09:51.216 --> 01:09:54.947
She's gone. She took all of her things,
and she's not coming back this time.

01:09:55.020 --> 01:09:57.250
Well, she won't leave without Jacob.

01:09:57.322 --> 01:09:59.620
- I'll go to the Pettis place.
- I'm coming.

01:09:59.691 --> 01:10:01.921
No. Go home and wait for her.

01:10:25.183 --> 01:10:28.084
If my husband sees you,
he'll run you off again.

01:10:28.153 --> 01:10:30.144
I think Belinda might've come for Jacob.

01:10:30.222 --> 01:10:32.782
You're wrong.
He's in the barn, feeding the cow.

01:10:32.858 --> 01:10:36.851
- I'd like to check, if you don't mind.
- [Sighs]

01:10:43.702 --> 01:10:46.603
What are you doing back here?

01:10:48.006 --> 01:10:51.498
- The boy's run off.
- [Sighs]

01:10:53.378 --> 01:10:55.573
[Thunder Rumbling]

01:10:56.915 --> 01:10:59.383
All right, everybody.
Let's gather round.

01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:02.852
I have no idea where these kids might be
going, so we'll go in different directions.

01:11:02.921 --> 01:11:04.946
I'll go north. Clark, you go east.

01:11:05.023 --> 01:11:07.048
Anderson, you go south.
Missie, you go west.

01:11:07.125 --> 01:11:10.652
Pastor, if you don't mind, go back to the
church in case the kids seek refuge there.

01:11:10.729 --> 01:11:12.663
Let's everybody meet back here
by sundown.

01:11:12.731 --> 01:11:14.961
- Let's go by Anderson Pass.
- That's it.

01:11:15.033 --> 01:11:18.002
Taking the county road? All right.

01:11:18.070 --> 01:11:20.004
Let's go, boys.

01:11:21.006 --> 01:11:23.167
Hyah!

01:11:25.577 --> 01:11:28.375
[Thunder Rumbling]

01:11:47.431 --> 01:11:49.524
Belinda!

01:11:51.969 --> 01:11:53.903
Jacob!

01:11:59.376 --> 01:12:01.310
Belinda!

01:12:03.414 --> 01:12:06.906
[Thunderclaps]

01:12:17.828 --> 01:12:20.296
No one found them?
We have to go back out.

01:12:20.364 --> 01:12:22.958
- No.
- But they can't stay out there.

01:12:23.033 --> 01:12:25.263
Not in the dark, alone in the storm!

01:12:25.336 --> 01:12:28.897
Zach's right, Missie. It's too dark to look
for 'em now. We have to wait until dawn.

01:12:28.973 --> 01:12:32.272
Belinda's a smart, tough little girl.
She'll find shelter for her and Jacob.

01:12:32.343 --> 01:12:35.403
What if there is no shelter where they are?
What if there's a wash?

01:12:35.479 --> 01:12:37.743
They don't know it's not safe
because of flash floods.

01:12:37.815 --> 01:12:40.249
It'll be no help to them
if you get lost too.

01:12:40.317 --> 01:12:43.480
Maddy needs you. Stay with him.

01:12:43.554 --> 01:12:46.955
We'll talk to more parishioners, arrange
for a search party to go out in the morning.

01:12:47.024 --> 01:12:50.084
We'll stay with you tonight, Missie.

01:12:50.160 --> 01:12:52.151
I'll stay with you.

01:12:53.731 --> 01:12:56.063
I'm so scared, Papa.

01:12:58.836 --> 01:13:01.304
All right. Let's go, boys.

01:13:01.372 --> 01:13:03.806
- All right, Clancy. You ready?
- Right behind you.

01:13:03.874 --> 01:13:05.774
Let's go.

01:13:05.843 --> 01:13:08.403
[Men Chattering]

01:13:08.479 --> 01:13:10.413
Okay. Hyah!

01:13:22.326 --> 01:13:24.624
Jacob! Up there. Come on!

01:13:24.695 --> 01:13:26.629
[Screams]

01:13:36.907 --> 01:13:39.705
- [Crying]
- [Coughs]

01:13:39.777 --> 01:13:41.768
It's okay, Jacob. It's all right.

01:13:41.845 --> 01:13:44.143
We're just gonna stay here
till the rain stops.

01:13:44.214 --> 01:13:46.444
What'll we do then?
Where do we go?

01:13:47.685 --> 01:13:50.176
Don't worry, okay? I've got a plan.

01:14:01.932 --> 01:14:04.799
Belinda! Jacob!

01:14:10.941 --> 01:14:13.569
Belinda!

01:14:13.644 --> 01:14:15.578
Jacob!

01:14:31.629 --> 01:14:33.654
Let's pray.

01:14:33.731 --> 01:14:37.531
Dear Lord, please give those little children
the strength and the courage...

01:14:37.601 --> 01:14:39.831
to make it through this dark night.

01:14:39.903 --> 01:14:43.395
And give us the faith
to accept your will.

01:14:43.474 --> 01:14:45.465
- Amen.
- Amen.

01:14:52.116 --> 01:14:54.744
I don't know
if you can hear me or not, God.

01:14:54.818 --> 01:14:57.309
I'm not sure I even believe in you.

01:14:57.388 --> 01:15:00.619
But I know I can't find
those children without you.

01:15:02.092 --> 01:15:04.083
Hear my prayer, Lord.

01:15:06.697 --> 01:15:08.631
[Quiet Crying]

01:15:14.138 --> 01:15:16.606
[Jacob]
I'm so cold.

01:15:25.115 --> 01:15:28.642
Jacob? Belinda!

01:15:28.719 --> 01:15:31.347
[Belinda]
Over here! We're over here!

01:15:32.823 --> 01:15:35.018
Keep talking, Belinda.

01:15:35.092 --> 01:15:37.083
I'll follow your voice.

01:15:37.161 --> 01:15:39.254
Over here! We're over here!

01:15:42.666 --> 01:15:45.294
- [Jacob] Sheriff Tyler?
- Yes.

01:15:52.409 --> 01:15:54.741
You're safe now.
I'm gonna get you back.

01:15:54.812 --> 01:15:57.576
- Back to Mr. Pettis?
- No, son.

01:15:57.648 --> 01:15:59.946
Home, to Missie's.

01:16:45.095 --> 01:16:47.086
Why don't you come inside?

01:16:48.565 --> 01:16:51.227
Zach...

01:16:51.301 --> 01:16:56.034
there are no words that can begin to describe
the depth of my gratitude.

01:16:56.106 --> 01:16:58.074
None are necessary, Missie.

01:17:00.277 --> 01:17:04.213
So, what happens now?
Does Jacob have to go back to Pettis?

01:17:04.281 --> 01:17:07.114
No. No, we talked on the ride back...

01:17:07.184 --> 01:17:11.678
and he admitted to me that Hank's been
beating him and practically starving him.

01:17:11.755 --> 01:17:15.919
I'm gonna tell Hank, if he doesn't voluntarily
give up his legal guardianship of him...

01:17:15.993 --> 01:17:17.984
I'll arrest him.

01:17:19.463 --> 01:17:23.695
I don't think that Belinda and Jacob
should be separated again.

01:17:23.767 --> 01:17:26.258
I would like for him
to come and live with us.

01:17:26.336 --> 01:17:29.931
I think the Children's Aid Society
will go along with that.

01:17:31.241 --> 01:17:34.039
I can't believe
that you found them in that storm...

01:17:34.111 --> 01:17:36.773
all by yourself.

01:17:36.847 --> 01:17:38.781
Hmm.

01:17:39.950 --> 01:17:42.783
I wasn't alone out there, Missie.

01:17:42.853 --> 01:17:46.186
What do you mean?
I thought that you rode out by yourself.

01:17:46.256 --> 01:17:50.249
Yeah, I searched for hours,
calling them over and over again.

01:17:50.327 --> 01:17:53.956
It got to the point
where I felt hopeless.

01:17:54.031 --> 01:17:57.330
I knew I would never find them
on my own.

01:17:57.401 --> 01:18:00.234
So I prayed to God for help.

01:18:00.304 --> 01:18:03.535
Oh. Zach.

01:18:03.607 --> 01:18:07.703
And then I was absolutely silent,
and in that silence...

01:18:07.778 --> 01:18:12.340
I heard what I couldn't hear
while I was riding, calling them.

01:18:12.416 --> 01:18:15.078
- What?
- A child crying.

01:18:16.620 --> 01:18:20.056
The thing is is even standing still...

01:18:20.123 --> 01:18:23.854
I shouldn't have heard
that little voice over the storm.

01:18:26.230 --> 01:18:28.994
Maybe it wasn’t Jacob’s voice you heard.

01:18:30.634 --> 01:18:33.102
You spoke to God...

01:18:33.170 --> 01:18:35.161
and he answered you.

01:18:38.942 --> 01:18:40.933
With a miracle.

01:18:49.052 --> 01:18:52.146
[Missie]
When did you start coming here, Pa?

01:18:52.222 --> 01:18:54.554
When your mama died.

01:18:54.625 --> 01:18:57.116
This is where I said good-bye.

01:18:59.897 --> 01:19:01.888
How do you do that?

01:19:03.267 --> 01:19:06.361
How do you let go
of someone you love?

01:19:06.436 --> 01:19:08.927
When we love someone...

01:19:09.006 --> 01:19:11.566
that love doesn't die when they do.

01:19:11.642 --> 01:19:14.634
That stays in our hearts forever.

01:19:14.711 --> 01:19:19.114
But we do have to say good-bye
to the life we shared with them...

01:19:19.182 --> 01:19:22.345
go on with a new life...

01:19:22.419 --> 01:19:24.546
a chance at happiness.

01:19:24.621 --> 01:19:26.646
Willie would want me to be happy.

01:19:26.723 --> 01:19:28.350
Mm-hmm.

01:19:28.425 --> 01:19:31.019
I know that.

01:19:31.094 --> 01:19:33.153
He'd approve of Zach.

01:19:33.230 --> 01:19:35.164
He's a good man.

01:19:35.232 --> 01:19:37.757
[Chuckles]

01:19:37.834 --> 01:19:41.133
- But it feels like a betrayal.
- It isn't.

01:19:42.539 --> 01:19:45.201
And it doesn't matter
how I tell you that.

01:19:45.275 --> 01:19:48.733
You're gonna have to feel it, Missie.

01:19:50.113 --> 01:19:52.604
I think I'm gonna
go on back to the house.

01:19:52.683 --> 01:19:55.311
[Inhales]
You want to sit here for a while?

01:20:01.291 --> 01:20:03.225
Mmm.

01:20:07.831 --> 01:20:09.765
[Sighs]

01:20:13.904 --> 01:20:16.134
I'll always love you, Willie.

01:20:17.708 --> 01:20:21.269
But I am finally ready
to be happy again.

01:20:28.185 --> 01:20:30.119
Good-bye, sweetheart.

01:20:47.704 --> 01:20:49.968
Do you still have that locket?

01:20:50.040 --> 01:20:52.304
Why, yes. Right here.

01:20:52.376 --> 01:20:55.539
If you still want to give it to me,
I'll take it.

01:20:57.014 --> 01:20:59.881
But you said you couldn't accept
a gift like that.

01:20:59.950 --> 01:21:02.646
Unless it came
from someone that I loved.

01:21:09.159 --> 01:21:11.889
Will you put it on me, Zach?

01:21:11.962 --> 01:21:13.589
Gladly.

01:21:28.378 --> 01:21:32.439
There's something else I couldn't do
unless it was with the man I love.

01:21:44.394 --> 01:21:46.885
- Yea! Whoo!
- [Cheering]

01:21:50.867 --> 01:21:52.858
[Woman]
I wish you happiness!

01:21:58.875 --> 01:22:00.536
- [Clark] Bye, darlin'!!
- Bye-bye!

01:22:00.610 --> 01:22:02.601
I love you!

01:22:02.679 --> 01:22:04.670
[Jacob]
Come on, you guys. Come on. Let's go.

01:22:04.748 --> 01:22:06.682
Bye!

01:22:10.987 --> 01:22:13.319
[Screaming]

01:22:13.390 --> 01:22:16.291
- [Missie] Bye. Be good.
- Bye!

01:22:16.359 --> 01:22:18.486
[Zach]
Bye-bye.

01:22:18.562 --> 01:22:22.225
- [Cheering]
- Bye, Missie!
