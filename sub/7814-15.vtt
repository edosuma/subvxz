was a web of fat.

I think they used duct tape.

Kyle, if you're gonna
be up here with us,

absolutely quiet.

Loud and clear.
You don't have
to worry about me.

are allergic to.

14:53.083 --> 14:54.458
No distractions.

14:54.458 --> 14:55.709
Probably peanut butter.

14:58.709 --> 15:00.125

15:01.166 --> 15:03.208

But not if it's chunky.

15:03.208 --> 15:04.709

get stuck on my teeth.

chunky peanut butter either.

will make it all better!

Wait, Kick, Kyle's only
trying to help.

15:30.625 --> 15:32.875
And maybe a puppet show
would cheer me up.

We're doing the stunt.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.125
Did you say we, Kick?

20:11.125 --> 20:12.750
As a matter of fact I did, Kyle.

Kick, we're doing it.
You and me in a stunt.

No talking.

No.

20:33.083 --> 20:36.000
Hi, Mom, how was
your meeting for work?

20:36.000 --> 20:38.125
Well, I'm afraid riding

20:38.125 --> 20:40.542
as an entangled group
disqualifies you

20:40.542 --> 20:42.959
from getting you into
<i>The Global Book of Awesome.</i>

20:44.792 --> 20:46.083
By yourself anyway.

20:47.792 --> 20:50.166
Kick broke about
three dozen records
in the process.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.166
Never saw anything like it.

20:51.166 --> 20:53.166
All right, Kyle, time to go.

20:54.417 --> 20:56.166
Wow, Kick, tears of joy.

20:56.166 --> 20:57.291
I've never seen you so happy.

20:57.291 --> 20:59.083
You sure haven't, Kyle.

20:59.083 --> 21:01.709
Bye, Kyle.
See you later, alligator.

21:01.709 --> 21:03.083
Take care.

And they lived
happily ever after

21:21.375 --> 21:23.041
in the land of sunshine
and flowers

21:23.041 --> 21:24.458
and no chunky peanut butter.

21:24.458 --> 21:26.000
The end.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.834
So what you think?
