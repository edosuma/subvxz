WEBVTT

00:23.023 --> 00:25.483
Wow. You just got
dumped by someone

00:25.483 --> 00:27.652
who you weren't
even dating, Linds.

00:28.111 --> 00:29.571
Let's take a second to
think about that.

00:29.571 --> 00:30.739
It's pretty impressive.

00:31.573 --> 00:33.908
I just don't get it. Wh--

00:34.409 --> 00:36.578
Everything was going so well.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.497
In hindsight, maybe
a mistake to rub his nose

00:39.497 --> 00:41.833
in the fact that you
cavorted with another man

00:41.833 --> 00:43.376
like a common street whore.

00:43.376 --> 00:45.170
Jesus Christ, Mom.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.338
You know, he went home
with somebody else, too.

00:47.338 --> 00:48.465
Excuse me.

00:48.465 --> 00:49.632
He fornicated with

00:49.632 --> 00:51.593
one other partner
that he admitted to.

00:51.593 --> 00:53.261
Who knows the real total?

00:53.261 --> 00:55.555
That's why I recommend
a comprehensive venereal panel

00:55.555 --> 00:56.890
as soon as possible.

00:56.890 --> 00:58.600
Why do I even care, you know?

00:58.600 --> 00:59.726
The whole point of this

00:59.726 --> 01:01.603
was that it was supposed
to be casual.

01:01.603 --> 01:03.688
Because you love him, Lindsay.

01:04.147 --> 01:05.982
You've loved him
from the moment

01:05.982 --> 01:08.318
his tears fell on those

01:08.318 --> 01:12.363
blotchy, under-moisturized
cheeks of yours.

01:12.822 --> 01:16.743
Okay.
Maybe I... like him. A little.

01:16.743 --> 01:19.412
- Finally, she admits it.
- It's like pulling teeth.

01:19.412 --> 01:21.247
Hey.

01:21.247 --> 01:24.334
Remind me, bitch.
Why are you here?

01:24.834 --> 01:27.212
Oh no, Lindsay, not her.

01:27.212 --> 01:29.839
Did you seriously come
all the way to New York City

01:29.839 --> 01:32.258
to find a cute little boyfriend?

01:32.258 --> 01:35.970
Some cubicle-dwelling dweeb
you could snuggle up with

01:35.970 --> 01:38.139
to watch <i>Party of Five?</i>

01:38.139 --> 01:40.600
There's no need to drag
the Salinger siblings into this.

01:40.600 --> 01:43.686
'Cause I thought you
came here to find you.

01:44.145 --> 01:46.773
To meet bad boys,
and make bad decisions,

01:46.773 --> 01:50.401
and end up in terrifying situations.

01:50.401 --> 01:53.655
Maybe not... terrifying, but.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.574
Okay. Lindsay?
You don't know this person.

01:56.574 --> 01:59.953
She said a mean thing
to you once about a beverage...

01:59.953 --> 02:03.581
<i>♪ Your Diet Coke
is oppression in a can ♪</i>

02:03.581 --> 02:05.625
...and it's become an obsession.

02:05.625 --> 02:07.961
You don't even know her name.

02:07.961 --> 02:10.797
Oh yeah?
Well, I know her soul.

02:10.797 --> 02:11.965
- Oh, for God's s--
- Uck!

02:11.965 --> 02:14.217
- Yuck, Linds.
- The soul is a myth.

02:14.217 --> 02:16.094
You know, I used to
see you at parties,

02:16.094 --> 02:18.513
and you would just be
sitting there in the corner just

02:18.513 --> 02:21.266
reading Anaïs Nin,
and smoking cloves,

02:21.266 --> 02:23.309
and glaring at everybody.

02:23.309 --> 02:25.478
Y-You didn't care what
anyone thought.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.480
And that's all I did was care.

02:27.480 --> 02:30.233
- That's a good thing.
- Look, bitch.

02:30.233 --> 02:32.318
It's simple, okay?

02:33.486 --> 02:35.029
Miguel is over.

02:35.029 --> 02:37.323
Miguel and his nine-to-five,

02:37.323 --> 02:40.618
Brooks Brothers slow march

I said,
"Dude, do a Gatsby-themed

06:26.135 --> 06:27.720
"rehearsal dinner

06:27.720 --> 06:30.223

Nice.

06:30.223 --> 06:32.475
And guess what? She freaked.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.186
- Wow.
- Yup.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.314
Oop, there they are...
The happy couple.

06:43.736 --> 06:45.655
I hear they tried to fuck you.

06:45.655 --> 06:47.115
Uh, you know, I'm getting

06:47.115 --> 06:49.033
pretty close with Squez,
the juice company,

06:49.033 --> 06:50.660
and I think there
might be some legs there.

06:50.660 --> 06:52.787
Yeah, well, you oughta
talk to Dick about it.

06:54.705 --> 06:56.416
Because Dick Waltham wants

06:56.416 --> 06:57.792
to hear about an
eight-figure deal

06:57.792 --> 06:59.293
from a second-year analyst?

06:59.293 --> 07:02.463
Ugh, Jimmy. Jimmy, Jimmy.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.548
This weekend?

07:03.548 --> 07:05.716
That man is not the CFO

07:05.716 --> 07:06.926
of Winnicott Douglass.

07:06.926 --> 07:08.594
He's just Chad's dad,

07:08.594 --> 07:09.887
father of the groom.

07:09.887 --> 07:12.598
And you are not
a second-year analyst.

07:12.598 --> 07:15.893
You are his son's close friend
and trusted colleague.

07:16.853 --> 07:18.104
Could you introduce us?

07:18.229 --> 07:20.440
I could.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.568
But if you really wanna
impress the old man,

07:23.568 --> 07:25.611
you'll nut up
and do it yourself.

07:28.906 --> 07:30.658
This is it.

07:30.658 --> 07:32.201
You are not gonna allow anything

07:32.201 --> 07:33.828
to stand in your way
this weekend.

07:33.828 --> 07:36.497
You march up to that
old fucker right now

07:36.497 --> 07:40.585
- and tell him that--
- Hey... I know that chick.

07:51.095 --> 07:52.597
Random Lindsay.

07:52.597 --> 07:54.849
Miguel.

07:57.852 --> 07:59.520
What are you doing here?

07:59.520 --> 08:02.815
- There goes the fuckin' weekend.
- This asshole again? Really?

08:02.815 --> 08:04.192
I'm here for the wedding.

08:04.734 --> 08:06.068
For Charles's wedding?

08:06.861 --> 08:08.404
You mean Chad?

08:08.404 --> 08:09.614
I don't know. Derek just said

08:09.614 --> 08:10.781
it was his cousin, Charles.

08:10.781 --> 08:12.074
Who's Derek?

08:12.783 --> 08:15.369
- Hey.
- Oh, fuck. He's huge.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.497
This is, um, Derek.

08:17.497 --> 08:19.415
Derek, this is Miguel.

08:19.415 --> 08:21.167
I'm, I'm Miguel.
Nice to meet you.

08:23.753 --> 08:25.963
How long have, uh,
you two been dating?

08:26.756 --> 08:29.258
No, we're not dating.
We don't do labels.

08:29.258 --> 08:32.678
Yeah... labels are
for grocery stores.

08:32.678 --> 08:35.389
For items... that need labeling.

08:35.389 --> 08:37.934
God, you're amazing.

08:37.934 --> 08:40.436
Wow, cool. Where
are your costumes?

08:40.436 --> 08:43.648
Like we're gonna dress up
for a fucking costume party.

08:49.445 --> 08:52.740
- Stop thinking about her.
- I'm not thinking about her.

08:52.740 --> 08:55.076
Oh, oh, I see another
brown person.

08:55.076 --> 08:57.662
You're not the only--
Nope. Waiter.

08:57.662 --> 08:59.163
I'm not gonna feel
weird about that.

08:59.163 --> 09:00.456
You already feel
weird about that.

09:00.456 --> 09:01.791
Okay, stop.
Look, he belongs here.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.377
Hey...
you belong here, buddy.

09:05.628 --> 09:06.921
What?

09:08.130 --> 09:09.924
Oh! Hi!

09:10.341 --> 09:12.260
Oh! There he is. Look alive.

09:15.263 --> 09:16.138

09:16.138 --> 09:17.098

09:17.098 --> 09:18.432
So good to see you, bud.

09:18.975 --> 09:19.934
Hey, Chris.

09:19.934 --> 09:21.352

09:21.352 --> 09:23.187

a client, too.

09:23.187 --> 09:25.231

12:17.361 --> 12:20.322
Someone forgot their
1920s attire.

12:20.322 --> 12:23.617
I am 1920s. I'm a vagrant.

12:25.202 --> 12:28.289
- Have fun.
See ya, man.

12:30.124 --> 12:31.459
You wanna dance?

12:31.459 --> 12:32.918
No.

12:34.712 --> 12:36.130
You look beautiful.

12:42.803 --> 12:44.805
He's just been an
absolute standout

12:44.805 --> 12:46.724
from the second
he started with us.

12:46.724 --> 12:48.559
- Last quarter, especially.
Thank you.

12:48.559 --> 12:51.729
Anyway, we're so thrilled
you could make it out.

12:51.729 --> 12:53.814
- Talk to you a little bit later.
- Our pleasure. Thank you.

12:55.649 --> 12:56.650
Mr. Waltham.

12:56.650 --> 12:58.402
Um, Miguel Jimenez, sir.

12:58.402 --> 12:59.987
Second-year analyst.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.906
I'm actually a friend of Chad's

13:01.906 --> 13:04.200
and colleague, a trusted colleague.

13:04.200 --> 13:05.451
Pleasure to meet you.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.911
Um,

13:06.911 --> 13:08.537
I don't mean to talk business

13:08.537 --> 13:09.997
on an occasion like this,

13:09.997 --> 13:11.624
but I just had to tell you--

13:11.624 --> 13:13.667
I know it's usually
a three-year track

13:13.667 --> 13:16.545
from analyst to associate,
but, um...

13:17.880 --> 13:18.881
I'm ready now.

13:19.715 --> 13:21.091
How do you figure that?

13:21.091 --> 13:24.220
I'm better than any other
analyst you have.

13:25.387 --> 13:26.472
And...

13:28.808 --> 13:31.977
I'm on the cusp
of securing a major deal

13:31.977 --> 13:33.979
with an up-and-coming
juice company.

13:34.104 --> 13:38.818
Nantucket Nectars reported
$80 million in sales last year.

13:38.818 --> 13:40.110
Snapple?

13:40.736 --> 13:42.321
Had almost 800.

13:44.323 --> 13:46.659
The company I'm talking with,

13:46.659 --> 13:48.452
I firmly believe,

13:48.452 --> 13:50.621
has the potential
to compete with both of 'em.

13:53.290 --> 13:56.043
- Find me later. We'll talk after dinner.

13:57.002 --> 13:58.254
Sounds good.

14:08.597 --> 14:10.850
Beef medallions?

14:10.850 --> 14:13.102
This evening could not
be more grotesque.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.187
Yeah. I-I didn't even know
they were doing

14:15.187 --> 14:16.438
rehearsal dinners anymore.

14:16.438 --> 14:19.650
It's, like, what is it, 1973?

14:19.650 --> 14:21.485
Huh, exactly.

14:21.485 --> 14:23.028
How's your children's book?

14:23.445 --> 14:26.073
You said you were gonna
maybe start working on one?

14:26.824 --> 14:30.160
I-I had an idea once that
maybe I would write a,

14:30.160 --> 14:31.829
a children's book.

14:32.329 --> 14:33.747
I thought you said
you were writing

14:33.747 --> 14:35.374
an existential horror story

14:35.374 --> 14:37.293
about the monstrosity of nature?

14:38.961 --> 14:39.962
Yeah.

14:40.838 --> 14:42.381
As a children's book.

14:44.300 --> 14:46.927
Mmm, what do you do, Miguel?

14:47.970 --> 14:50.514
I work with Chad,
actually, at Winnicott.

14:50.514 --> 14:52.600
Ugh. I'm sorry.

14:53.851 --> 14:56.353
Oh, it's just banking,
you know, it's--

14:56.854 --> 15:00.608
I mean... you've seen
what it's done to my family.

15:03.277 --> 15:04.778
I guess...

15:04.778 --> 15:07.948
not everyone can afford to be
a writer for the <i>Village Voice.</i>

15:08.282 --> 15:09.408
Well,

15:09.408 --> 15:11.660
cultural critic and
predatory capitalist

15:11.660 --> 15:15.372
aren't the only extant
career paths available.

15:15.372 --> 15:18.083
- Where is it you bank, Derek?

15:19.251 --> 15:20.878
I don't have that kinda money.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.713
No, sorry,
I meant your trust fund.

15:22.713 --> 15:24.173
He doesn't have a trust fund.

15:24.173 --> 15:26.008
N-- No, no, no. It's--

15:26.008 --> 15:28.177
Look, my, my parents
set one up for me,

15:28.177 --> 15:32.473
but, uh... yeah,
I don't control it.

15:32.473 --> 15:34.850
No, right.
You just use it to

15:35.267 --> 15:37.019
fund your writerly lifestyle.

15:39.021 --> 15:42.441
<i>♪ Have you seen this
baby genius ♪</i>

15:42.441 --> 15:44.902
<i>♪ He'll bring you such joy ♪</i>

15:44.902 --> 15:47.863
<i>♪ He's my smart, smart,
smart, smart, smart ♪</i>

15:47.863 --> 15:49.490
You have any cocaine here?

15:50.157 --> 15:51.951
Somewhere in the house?

15:54.244 --> 15:56.080
Gentlemen, we're, uh,

15:56.080 --> 15:58.290
headed to the cabin
for some cigars.

15:58.290 --> 15:59.375
You in?

16:00.501 --> 16:03.545
Dick asked to make sure
you were there, Jimmy.

16:04.088 --> 16:05.881
Then I guess I have
to be there, don't I?

16:05.881 --> 16:07.299
Hey, wait, I'm sorry.

16:07.299 --> 16:09.802
So, is your name Miguel
or is it Jimmy?

16:10.803 --> 16:13.055
- That's just a nickname.
- It's because of his last name:

16:13.055 --> 16:14.390
Gym-en-ez.

16:14.390 --> 16:17.434
Um, so then wouldn't it
be pronounced "Jimenez"?

16:17.434 --> 16:19.103
It, it doesn't matter,
all right?

16:19.103 --> 16:20.771
- Cigars.
- No, it does matter, though,

16:20.771 --> 16:23.774
because this guy right here
is actually being pretty racist.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.568
- Derek, I-I don't think it's right--
- Is it, is it racist?

16:26.568 --> 16:28.737
- Am, am I, am I racist?
- N-No. No, you're not--

16:28.737 --> 16:31.115
Yeah, bro, very racist.
I'm sorry, Miguel.

16:31.115 --> 16:33.283
Man, if I were you,
I'd be standing up for myself.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.702
What he's doing, it's not right.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.620
You actually have no idea
what you're talkin' about,

16:36.620 --> 16:39.540
so why don't you
just shut the fuck up, Derek?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.500
Whoa.

16:42.209 --> 16:44.211
Everything okay here?

16:47.423 --> 16:48.424
Yeah.

16:48.882 --> 16:50.926
Yeah, no, everything's,
um, everything's fine.

16:50.926 --> 16:52.928
We're heading over to the cabin.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.388
Right?

16:55.472 --> 16:57.599
Maybe you should take
a walk instead.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.393
Cool down.

17:01.061 --> 17:02.688
Walk with me.

17:04.523 --> 17:07.151
Hey, I was just trying to help.

17:11.655 --> 17:12.781
Miguel.

17:13.991 --> 17:16.618
Miguel... Miguel, will you stop?

17:16.618 --> 17:18.620
Look, I'm sorry for what
happened in there, okay?

17:18.620 --> 17:19.747
No, I'm sorry.

17:19.747 --> 17:21.206
I'm sorry your boyfriend's
an asshole.

17:21.206 --> 17:23.292
He's not my boyfriend.

17:24.418 --> 17:25.461
What happened to you?

17:25.461 --> 17:27.379
Because the Lindsay I knew

17:27.379 --> 17:29.339
was excited about everything.

17:30.257 --> 17:31.884
In love with everything.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.719
This is who I've always been.

17:33.719 --> 17:36.972
This is exactly the person
that I've always wanted to be.

17:36.972 --> 17:38.891
Wow. Congratulations, then.
That must be really nice.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.309
You don't get to dump me

17:40.309 --> 17:42.144
and then just show up
three months later and start--

17:42.144 --> 17:43.645
Dump you?

17:43.645 --> 17:46.023
You were the one who didn't
even wanna be in a relationship.

17:46.023 --> 17:47.149
You wanted casual.

17:47.149 --> 17:48.776
No, you said you
wanted casual.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.903
Because I knew that's
what you wanted me to say.

17:50.903 --> 17:54.740
You said that you wanted
to be friends. You ended it.

17:54.740 --> 17:56.700
I ended things because
I was terrified

17:56.700 --> 17:58.869
I was falling in love with you!

18:07.711 --> 18:09.129
That's when I thought
I knew you.

18:10.255 --> 18:11.673
And this person now?

18:12.299 --> 18:13.509
I don't know her.

18:16.303 --> 18:17.763
I don't know her at all.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.850
Were you really falling
in love with me?

18:26.855 --> 18:27.856
I have to go.

18:37.950 --> 18:40.702
- Why did I say that?
- She tricked you. Again.

18:40.702 --> 18:42.454
Just like with the crying.

18:42.454 --> 18:43.956
You need to focus the fuck up.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.833
Get your head outta your ass
and back in the game.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.000
Let's go find that cabin,

18:47.000 --> 18:48.252
you walk in,
you drop to your knees,

18:48.252 --> 18:49.795
and you grovel.

18:49.795 --> 18:51.421
Are you joking?
It is too late for that.

18:51.421 --> 18:53.924
You did the only thing,

18:53.924 --> 18:57.136
the one thing
you are not supposed to do:

18:57.719 --> 18:58.971
you scared them.

18:58.971 --> 19:00.472
The next time you
see those men,

19:00.472 --> 19:01.598
you tell them exactly what

19:01.598 --> 19:03.183
Mrs. Woodruff told
your father and me

19:03.183 --> 19:05.185
at your third grade
parent-teacher conference.

19:09.273 --> 19:11.108
The... fuck was that?

19:13.277 --> 19:15.404
What she said was,
"Mr. and Mrs. Jimenez...

19:15.404 --> 19:17.531
- Oh, my God.
- ..."your son is gonna be President

19:17.531 --> 19:19.158
of the United States someday."

19:19.158 --> 19:20.742
Okay?
That's the kind of brilliance

19:20.742 --> 19:21.910
we're talking about here.

19:21.910 --> 19:22.953
She was talking about me

19:22.953 --> 19:24.163
running for student council.

19:24.163 --> 19:26.248
As a stepping stone.

19:33.338 --> 19:36.258
What an arrogant,
self-righteous butt wipe.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.759
He's like Pedro on
<i>The Real World,</i>

19:37.759 --> 19:39.094
if all Pedro did
was yell at Puck

19:39.094 --> 19:41.054
for putting his finger
in his peanut butter.

19:41.054 --> 19:43.098
Whoa... you're siding with Puck?

19:43.098 --> 19:44.641
Uh, yeah.

19:45.100 --> 19:46.310
Miguel never got you.

19:47.019 --> 19:48.020
Not like I do.

19:48.687 --> 19:50.355
Not like Derek does.

19:55.277 --> 19:56.445
Mm.

19:58.113 --> 20:02.159
You're a badass bitch just
like me who doesn't give a fuck.

20:02.159 --> 20:03.243
But...

20:03.994 --> 20:05.746
I do give a fuck.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.747
Mm-mm.

20:06.747 --> 20:09.458
I give a lotta fucks, actually.

20:10.292 --> 20:13.837
You don't know me at all,
and I-I don't know you.

20:13.837 --> 20:16.173
My mom was right.
I-I don't even know your name.

20:16.173 --> 20:18.592
It's Liz... probably.

20:18.592 --> 20:20.802
I don't think I wanna
be friends with you anymore.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.263
We were never friends.

20:23.972 --> 20:25.182
Exactly.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.644
I wanna trust you.

20:28.644 --> 20:31.063
I'm just so scared you're
gonna hurt me.

20:32.522 --> 20:35.150
- Ah, ah! Wh--
- I don't know what happened.

20:36.735 --> 20:39.488
We got to the cabin,
and Chad and Kevin asked

20:39.488 --> 20:40.906
if I wanna try something
really fun,

20:40.906 --> 20:43.158
so of course I said yes
because I like really fun stuff.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.285
They blindfolded me,
put me in the suit,

20:45.285 --> 20:46.995
shoved a ghost pepper
in my mouth,

20:46.995 --> 20:48.247
and told me
to run like the wind,

20:48.247 --> 20:49.623
and if I stopped running,
even for a second,

20:49.623 --> 20:50.916
they said they would know,

20:50.916 --> 20:52.542
and I would have to swallow
the ghost pepper--

20:52.542 --> 20:53.877
Was Miguel-- I mean, did you

20:53.877 --> 20:55.003
see Miguel down there?

20:55.379 --> 20:58.006
He never showed up...
Lucky bastard.

20:59.424 --> 21:00.634
Miguel?

21:01.009 --> 21:02.135
Miguel?!

21:04.137 --> 21:05.347
Miguel?!

21:06.014 --> 21:08.225
- Miguel?!
Lindsay!

21:08.725 --> 21:09.685
Miguel?!

21:10.143 --> 21:11.770
Hey. Hi.

21:12.521 --> 21:13.730
You came to find me.

21:13.730 --> 21:15.482
Well, yeah.
You, you told me

21:15.482 --> 21:16.858
you were afraid of the woods.

21:17.484 --> 21:18.944
You remembered that?

21:18.944 --> 21:20.237
Of course.

21:21.154 --> 21:22.698
I don't wanna scare you,

21:22.698 --> 21:25.117
but there's a bear...
somewhere around here.

21:25.117 --> 21:26.243
Hey,

21:26.243 --> 21:27.452
he went home.

21:28.620 --> 21:30.706

Have you seen a bear?

23:29.408 --> 23:32.369
'Bout yea high?
Ghost pepper in his mouth?

23:33.036 --> 23:35.038
Things got pretty crazy

23:36.373 --> 23:37.374
Oh, wait.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.709
