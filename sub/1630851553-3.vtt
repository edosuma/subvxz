WEBVTT

00:24.357 --> 00:27.944
[man in Italian] I became
a public prosecutor

00:28.028 --> 00:32.907
because I believe in justice and truth.

00:36.036 --> 00:38.705
This is a very tough city.

00:39.289 --> 00:44.377
Every neighborhood in Naples
is controlled by the Camorra,

00:44.461 --> 00:46.379
a group like the Mafia.

00:48.298 --> 00:54.637
For a long time, I had a security team
to prevent my murder.

01:03.063 --> 01:08.068
In 2003, Camorra informants told us

01:08.151 --> 01:10.779
that there was something corrupt

01:10.862 --> 01:14.657
at the very highest levels
of Italian football.

01:17.118 --> 01:18.161
[fence rattling]

01:18.244 --> 01:21.414
Everybody knows Italy lives for football.

01:23.750 --> 01:28.546
But we never imagined
that this investigation

01:28.630 --> 01:32.550
would lead to one of the biggest ever
scandals in Italy.

01:32.634 --> 01:35.053
[crowd cheering]

01:41.309 --> 01:42.143
[whistle blows]

01:42.227 --> 01:46.981
The storm engulfing Italian Football
is growing.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.025
[crowd cheering]

01:49.109 --> 01:52.153
[commentator] Goal! Incredible!

01:52.821 --> 01:55.657
[man 1] These shocking wiretaps
are like an earthquake.

01:56.241 --> 01:59.160
[man 2 in English] Managers and officials
could end up in jail.

01:59.244 --> 02:01.079
[crowd cheering]

02:02.497 --> 02:04.916
[man 3 in Italian] The world of football
is poisoned.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.835
-[cameras clicking]
-[chanting]

02:06.918 --> 02:09.045
[man 4] Juventus, champions of Italy.

02:09.629 --> 02:11.089
[man 5 in English] This is seismic.

02:11.172 --> 02:13.883
The biggest scandal
in the history of Italian football.

02:16.219 --> 02:19.097
[theme music playing]

02:49.377 --> 02:52.922
[crowd cheering]

03:09.230 --> 03:12.192
[Pino in Italian] That summer,
witnesses told us

03:12.275 --> 03:15.653
about a group we'd never heard of before…

03:16.446 --> 03:17.947
The Roman Posse.

03:20.491 --> 03:25.955
The Roman Posse was a mysterious
and secret group of powerful referees

03:27.165 --> 03:32.503
who were influencing football matches
at the highest level,

03:32.587 --> 03:35.673
that is the Serie A league.

03:35.757 --> 03:37.759
[ominous music playing]

03:38.676 --> 03:43.348
Power is fascinating.
Power captivates and corrupts.

03:45.016 --> 03:48.269
Referees have enormous power.

03:48.937 --> 03:53.691
If that power is used illegally,

03:53.775 --> 03:55.610
it can shape the outcome of a game,

03:56.569 --> 04:00.323
or even an entire season.

04:04.661 --> 04:10.083
Our witnesses told us
that the Roman Posse

04:10.166 --> 04:12.835
was somehow connected to

04:12.919 --> 04:15.129
the most important club in Italy,
Juventus.

04:16.214 --> 04:18.758
[crowd cheering]

04:21.386 --> 04:23.388
[chanting]

04:26.975 --> 04:29.811
[man in English] Juventus are
the most successful club in Italy.

04:32.355 --> 04:36.359
And have been, historically,
going all the way back to the 1950s.

04:36.442 --> 04:38.611
[crowd cheering]

04:38.695 --> 04:44.659
In 2004, Juventus had
27 Serie A titles to their name,

04:45.618 --> 04:48.413
which is pretty incredible,
because that's almost as many

04:48.496 --> 04:51.416
as the next two teams combined.

04:51.499 --> 04:53.501
[crowd cheering]

04:56.462 --> 05:01.050
[in Italian] The passion, the love…
like the love for your wife.

05:02.468 --> 05:04.846
I was born in a black and white shirt.

05:08.266 --> 05:10.560
[woman in English] Juventus are owned
by the Agnelli family.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.270
They are like the Kennedys.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.188
This is a family that contributed

05:14.272 --> 05:17.066
five percent of the annual GDP of Italy.

05:17.150 --> 05:20.528
[Gabriele] They own Fiat,
they own Ferrari,

05:20.611 --> 05:22.322
they have a media empire.

05:23.114 --> 05:28.119
The Agnelli family is the closest thing
that we have in Italy to a royal family.

05:28.953 --> 05:31.247
It's hugely, hugely powerful.

05:37.170 --> 05:38.838
[ominous music playing]

05:39.630 --> 05:41.257
[water dripping]

05:42.050 --> 05:45.970
[Pino in Italian] I knew the investigation
would be really difficult

05:46.054 --> 05:52.185
because football is a very important part
of this country's economy.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.188
It was an investigation into power.

05:56.856 --> 06:01.319
You can't do this type
of investigation alone.

06:02.612 --> 06:06.449
The first thing I did
was call Rome's Military police.

06:06.532 --> 06:08.534
[church bell tolling]

06:08.618 --> 06:11.287
[man] I got a call
from Public Prosecutor Narducci,

06:11.371 --> 06:16.626
and I told him straight away

06:16.709 --> 06:18.711
this is really serious.

06:22.799 --> 06:25.259
We got on straight away.

06:25.343 --> 06:26.636
[laughs]

06:27.428 --> 06:30.264
We smoked a lot together.

06:30.848 --> 06:34.769
Uh, I was a cigar smoker,
and he smoked cigarettes.

06:40.650 --> 06:45.488
[Pino] Our goal was to find out everything
about the Roman Posse.

06:46.406 --> 06:49.033
Who was part of it? What were they up to?

06:50.118 --> 06:53.246
We needed to reach
the heart of the system.

06:54.956 --> 06:58.209
[Attilio] It was going to be difficult
to find evidence of crimes.

06:59.001 --> 07:03.798
We didn't have anyone
on the inside, an informer.

07:03.881 --> 07:08.719
[Attilio] So, we got a warrant
to tap their phones.

07:10.721 --> 07:16.519
We needed to wiretap the two people
in charge of the Referees' Association.

07:17.186 --> 07:20.731
Paolo Bergamo and Pierluigi Pairetto.

07:21.983 --> 07:25.611
[Attilio] We also wiretapped
the sporting director of Juventus…

07:26.154 --> 07:28.823
who had enormous power.

07:30.158 --> 07:31.659
His name was Luciano Moggi.

07:34.704 --> 07:35.997
[indistinct talking]

07:36.080 --> 07:37.999
[Gabriele in English]
Luciano Moggi was seen

07:38.082 --> 07:41.544
as this very clever wheeler-dealer
director of football.

07:42.962 --> 07:45.631
-[camera clicks]
-He grew from out of nothing, really.

07:46.424 --> 07:48.676
He comes from this poor, rural hamlet.

07:49.260 --> 07:50.970
He desperately wants to be in football,

07:51.053 --> 07:53.848
but has to pay the bills, 
so he gets a job with the railway

07:54.724 --> 07:56.851
which allows him to watch games.

07:57.894 --> 08:01.647
He becomes an exceptional scout
who had a real eye for talent.

08:03.858 --> 08:07.570
[in Italian] I'm not bragging,
but even when I worked on the railways,

08:07.653 --> 08:13.117
I was a leader. My dad taught me
the value of hard work.

08:13.201 --> 08:14.118
[camera clicks]

08:14.202 --> 08:17.705
[Mina in English] He built himself
working for various different clubs…

08:19.415 --> 08:22.043
before reaching
what was considered the top,

08:22.710 --> 08:26.339
being a sporting director
of Juventus Football Club.

08:27.757 --> 08:29.759
He brings in these tremendous players:

08:30.718 --> 08:33.262
Zinedine Zidane, Pavel Nedvěd,

08:34.263 --> 08:35.932
-"Gigi" Buffon.
-[crowd roars]

08:37.099 --> 08:40.645
So, with all the glamour and the money
coming in to the Italian game,

08:41.312 --> 08:44.857
Moggi very much
was the architect behind the scenes.

08:45.900 --> 08:48.486
[man in Italian] What don't you like
about football?

08:49.445 --> 08:52.198
-Losing.
-[man laughs]

08:54.116 --> 08:56.536
[dog barks]

08:59.372 --> 09:02.667
[Pino] We set up
a listening room in central Rome.

09:04.502 --> 09:08.631
[Attilio] It was a small team.
Reliable, very close.

09:15.179 --> 09:18.474
The investigation needed to be top secret.

09:18.558 --> 09:23.854
Any leak would completely risk

09:23.938 --> 09:26.274
compromising it.

09:31.487 --> 09:32.613
[static crackling]

09:32.697 --> 09:34.407
[phone line ringing]

09:34.490 --> 09:36.492
[Moggi] I'm coming back
to Turin tomorrow.

09:36.576 --> 09:38.327
I've got a gift for you.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.037
[man 1] You shouldn't have!

09:40.121 --> 09:43.165
-[Moggi] Don't bust my balls.
-[man 1] Okay, if you insist.

09:45.418 --> 09:48.296
[Pino] Out of all the people
we were wiretapping,

09:48.379 --> 09:53.884
Luciano Moggi was the one
we heard speaking the most.

09:53.968 --> 09:55.469
[static crackling]

09:55.553 --> 10:00.016
He talked day and night.

10:02.226 --> 10:03.811
[man 2] Greatest Luciano, how are you?

10:03.894 --> 10:05.438
[Moggi] I'm fine, thanks.

10:05.521 --> 10:10.026
[man 2] I see you on the news.
I see you on TV. Don't get in trouble.

10:11.611 --> 10:15.197
[Attilio] The officer in charge
of listening said,

10:15.281 --> 10:19.869
"Look, Commander, I can't keep up

10:19.952 --> 10:25.166
because there are so many calls!"

10:25.249 --> 10:26.917
[phone ringing]

10:27.001 --> 10:29.629
[indistinct chattering]

10:29.712 --> 10:30.796
[crowd cheering]

10:31.380 --> 10:34.967
[Gabriele in English] In the summer
of 2004, Juventus had a problem.

10:36.510 --> 10:39.805
The previous season,
it ended up as a bit of a disaster.

10:40.473 --> 10:44.101
-A.C. Milan had won the Serie A title.
-[chanting]

10:44.185 --> 10:47.104
They were Juventus' biggest rivals.

10:48.689 --> 10:51.025
[Mina] Milan were owned
by Silvio Berlusconi.

10:51.108 --> 10:53.694
He was the Prime Minister of Italy,
at the time.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.529
So, there was this great rivalry,

10:55.613 --> 10:57.823
because it was Berlusconi
versus the Agnellis.

10:58.407 --> 10:59.700
[tires screeching]

11:00.618 --> 11:02.620
[commentator 1 in Italian]
Moggi almost got run over!

11:02.703 --> 11:03.996
[commentator 2 laughs]

11:04.997 --> 11:08.709
[commentator 2] Someone wants
to take him out.

11:08.793 --> 11:10.836
-[comm 1] There's Umberto Agnelli.
-[comm 2 laughs]

11:12.129 --> 11:14.757
[Gabriele in English]
The screws were turned on Moggi.

11:14.840 --> 11:18.719
He needed to do something bold
to regain the upper hand.

11:18.803 --> 11:23.891
He signed Zlatan Ibrahimović,
one of the great young talents in Europe.

11:24.767 --> 11:27.770
And Moggi really managed
the greatest coup of all,

11:27.853 --> 11:31.148
by getting the best manager
at the time, Fabio Capello.

11:33.818 --> 11:37.530
[in Italian] All the other teams
should be scared.

11:37.613 --> 11:41.826
[chuckles] It's difficult to win
all the time, but we're going to try.

11:47.164 --> 11:49.959
[Gabriele in English] The Serie A season
begins with victories.

11:51.252 --> 11:54.296
-Zlatan Ibrahimović was in his debut.
-[crowd cheering]

11:54.380 --> 11:57.383
And then Juventus go to Sampdoria.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.429
[commentator]
Should be a great night, this.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.889
[Gabriele] Potentially tricky away game.

12:03.973 --> 12:06.475
[commentator]
Listen to these Sampdoria fans.

12:06.976 --> 12:08.352
[crowd cheering]

12:10.563 --> 12:11.856
[whistle blows]

12:13.274 --> 12:15.401
And this is Mauro Germán Camoranesi.

12:16.110 --> 12:17.903
Strong deep by Camoranesi.

12:18.529 --> 12:21.490
[Gabriele] Early in the first half
there's a penalty awarded to Juventus.

12:22.199 --> 12:24.827
[commentator] I think he must've given
a penalty here, Dondarini.

12:24.910 --> 12:27.329
It's a yellow card for Falcone
for complaining.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.874
From my point of view,
it's a referee mistake.

12:30.458 --> 12:33.753
From the replays,
it appears that if a foul is committed,

12:33.836 --> 12:35.629
it's committed by a Juve player.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.552
[commentator] The Sampdoria players
are absolutely furious.

12:41.635 --> 12:42.887
[crowd roaring]

12:46.807 --> 12:48.768
[crowd cheering]

12:48.851 --> 12:50.644
[Mina] Sampdoria collapsed after that.

12:50.728 --> 12:54.106
[commentator] Great cut by Ibrahimović,
instant impact.

12:55.399 --> 12:56.692
Hit by Trezeguet!

12:56.776 --> 12:58.027
[crowd cheering]

12:58.110 --> 13:00.404
[Mina] It's a three-nil victory
for Juventus.

13:01.697 --> 13:04.450
[commentator] Flachi's furious,
but this is all down to the referee.

13:05.951 --> 13:10.623
The losing team always feels hard done by.
It's the nature of football.

13:10.706 --> 13:16.295
But Juventus had won, three-nil,
and the referee was just doing his job.

13:18.881 --> 13:21.258
A referee has a lot of power over a game.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.054
Football is,
by its very nature, a low-scoring sport.

13:25.554 --> 13:29.433
And so, individual decisions have
an out-sized influence.

13:30.643 --> 13:34.063
[Mina] Juventus had this reputation
of always getting favorable decisions,

13:34.146 --> 13:36.899
and this had been something
that was spoken about,

13:36.982 --> 13:38.567
it was a conspiracy theory.

13:39.860 --> 13:42.571
[in Italian] I'll just say this:

13:42.655 --> 13:47.201
Juventus does everything by the book.

13:47.952 --> 13:51.413
In Italy, everyone hates winners.

13:51.914 --> 13:56.252
Juventus has never cheated.
Maybe others do.

14:01.590 --> 14:05.344
Nobody in Italy could have imagined

14:05.427 --> 14:09.682
that such a big investigation

14:09.765 --> 14:13.352
into football was taking place.

14:15.271 --> 14:20.109
[Pino] But to start with,
there wasn't anything incriminating.

14:20.818 --> 14:24.071
We needed concrete proof

14:24.738 --> 14:27.867
that the referees were being pressured.

14:33.497 --> 14:35.791
[Gabriele in English] By November,
everything was going smoothly

14:35.875 --> 14:36.917
for Juventus.

14:37.001 --> 14:38.627
[Mina] They won eight
of their nine matches,

14:38.711 --> 14:40.921
and they were looking like
the team to beat.

14:41.547 --> 14:43.674
Milan was in second place.

14:47.970 --> 14:52.892
[Gabriele] Juventus are fine.
They have an away match against Reggina.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.810
[crowd chanting]

14:54.894 --> 14:59.481
A small club. Most people forecast
an easy win for Juventus.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.276
[commentator in Italian]
The match is starting.

15:02.359 --> 15:04.028
How many will Juve score tonight?

15:06.488 --> 15:10.075
-[whistle blows]
-Reggina attacking. Ball played in.

15:10.159 --> 15:13.621
[Gabriele in English] Early on
in the match, Reggina take the lead.

15:13.704 --> 15:15.706
[commentator in Italian] Incredible goal!

15:15.789 --> 15:18.918
[Mina in English] But Zlatan Ibrahimović
immediately equalized.

15:19.001 --> 15:21.587
[commentator in Italian]
Goal! Juventus has equalized.

15:22.212 --> 15:26.133
[Gabriele in English] But then,
long-range free kick from Zamboni.

15:26.216 --> 15:28.177
[commentator in Italian] Zamboni scores!

15:28.719 --> 15:31.347
[Gabriele in English] Juventus are angry.
Right? This is not supposed to happen.

15:33.223 --> 15:34.850
[commentator in Italian] Ibrahimović…

15:36.602 --> 15:39.229
[Mina in English] Ibrahimović gets
the ball into the back of the net.

15:39.313 --> 15:41.607
[commentator in Italian]
Wait! There's been a foul.

15:43.150 --> 15:46.236
[Mina in English]
But it's ruled out because of a foul.

15:48.656 --> 15:51.367
[commentator in Italian]
Only two minutes left. Juve's attacking.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.662
Goal!

15:55.621 --> 15:57.623
[Mina in English]
They finally get the goal.

15:58.832 --> 16:01.168
[in English] But then,
there's this very dramatic moment…

16:01.251 --> 16:03.462
[commentator in Italian]
Reggina are furious.

16:04.755 --> 16:07.091
[Gabriele in English] …where you see
the referee, Gianluca Paparesta,

16:07.174 --> 16:10.719
going over to speak to
the assistant referee, Aniello Di Mauro.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.014
[commentator in Italian]
It all comes down to this moment.

16:16.934 --> 16:20.270
Paparesta rules out the goal.
It's offside!

16:20.354 --> 16:22.940
[crowd roaring]

16:28.487 --> 16:30.781
[Paparesta] When you see something
and you're certain,

16:30.864 --> 16:33.575
you must decide immediately.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.870
I didn't stop to think
it was the last minute of a match

16:36.954 --> 16:42.001
in which Juventus was losing,
otherwise you become biased.

16:42.710 --> 16:43.794
You must referee.

16:45.504 --> 16:47.297
[Gabriele in English]
It was the correct call.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.800
However, it's also
a very marginal decision.

16:49.883 --> 16:52.469
[commentator in Italian]
Incredible end to the game!

17:00.436 --> 17:02.229
[Paparesta] The tension was obvious.

17:04.356 --> 17:09.445
Luciano Moggi came
into the changing room to complain.

17:09.528 --> 17:15.200
He said it was shameful,
absurd to rule out those goals.

17:21.540 --> 17:24.126
[Pino] As soon as
the Reggina-Juventus match was over,

17:24.209 --> 17:26.712
Moggi made lots of calls.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.924
He was furious.

17:33.093 --> 17:34.720
[phone line ringing]

17:34.803 --> 17:40.142
[Moggi] Look, two goals disallowed.
A penalty, scandalous!

17:40.225 --> 17:42.728
[man] Yes, I saw. It's a scandal.

17:42.811 --> 17:44.480
[Attilio] We listened to it live.

17:45.481 --> 17:48.233
[Moggi] I locked the referee
in the dressing room

17:48.317 --> 17:51.695
-and took the keys with me to the airport.
-[man] Yeah, no way!

17:53.363 --> 17:57.117
We looked at each other,

17:57.701 --> 18:00.496
"What the hell, shit." [chuckles]

18:00.579 --> 18:05.042
"Play it again, let me hear it again."

18:05.125 --> 18:05.959
[tape rewinds]

18:06.043 --> 18:09.505
[Moggi] It's true. I locked him in
and took the key away.

18:09.588 --> 18:12.299
Now they'll have to kick the door down.

18:15.010 --> 18:18.263
[Pino] A football club director

18:18.347 --> 18:21.767
can get as mad as they like.

18:22.351 --> 18:27.481
What they can't do
is to approach a referee

18:27.564 --> 18:31.693
and threaten him or insult him,

18:31.777 --> 18:34.321
because this is strictly forbidden.

18:36.073 --> 18:37.157
[phone line ringing]

18:37.783 --> 18:40.119
[Moggi] For me,
Paparesta is a piece of shit.

18:40.202 --> 18:42.913
He has to be stopped.
Both the assistants, too.

18:45.999 --> 18:50.796
I thought, he'd let off steam
and that would be the end of it.

18:51.755 --> 18:53.465
But it didn't end there.

18:53.549 --> 18:55.342
[crowd cheering]

18:57.803 --> 19:01.390
[man] "Ladies and gentlemen,
the Biscardi trial."

19:01.473 --> 19:03.225
♪ Biscardi, oley, oley ♪

19:09.398 --> 19:11.608
[Gabriele in English] Aldo Biscardi
created a TV program

19:11.692 --> 19:13.360
called Il Processo, The Trial.

19:14.319 --> 19:17.406
It was a very influential
television program.

19:18.699 --> 19:20.784
[in Italian] Thank you, good evening.

19:22.703 --> 19:26.373
[Pino] Moggi was aware that controlling
public opinion was crucial.

19:27.249 --> 19:30.127
Aldo Biscardi was a close friend.

19:31.461 --> 19:32.796
[phone line ringing]

19:32.880 --> 19:38.010
[Moggi] I want Paparesta suspended
and his linesman.

19:38.719 --> 19:42.931
They were shit in this match.
Now they must be punished.

19:44.224 --> 19:47.102
[Biscardi] Yes,
why not take back his license?

19:49.813 --> 19:52.608
-[crowd cheering and applauding]
-…The Trial. Thank you.

19:53.150 --> 19:57.196
[Attilio] So, on Monday night we tuned in.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.616
Thank you. Thank you.

20:01.241 --> 20:06.997
[Pino] We wanted to see
whether Biscardi would follow

20:07.080 --> 20:10.667
the directions from Luciano Moggi.

20:11.501 --> 20:14.713
Yet again, a refereeing scandal.

20:15.589 --> 20:19.218
The referees are making mistakes.
It must be stopped!

20:21.136 --> 20:26.350
It made me very angry.
My career was at stake.

20:27.643 --> 20:30.896
-Paparesta's license should be taken away.
-Or suspended.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.981
Then take away his license!

20:33.065 --> 20:35.692
[crowd cheering and applauding]

20:39.571 --> 20:45.953
Until all this happened,
I was happy to referee.

20:46.036 --> 20:49.539
I liked it. I traveled the world.

20:49.623 --> 20:55.629
I couldn't wait for my son to grow up
so that I could bring him with me.

20:58.548 --> 21:01.176
[Gabriele in English]
Gianluca Paparesta was suspended

21:01.260 --> 21:05.055
by the Italian Referees' Association
for two games.

21:05.138 --> 21:07.099
When he came back,
he refereed a lower division game.

21:07.182 --> 21:08.976
MOGGI SAYS,
"THAT REFEREE SHOULD BE REPLACED"

21:09.059 --> 21:11.436
[Gabriele] I think a lot of referees
saw that and were like,

21:11.520 --> 21:13.438
"All right, he's been sent a message."

21:14.564 --> 21:16.441
[in Italian] It saddens me

21:16.525 --> 21:19.152
that I was punished
by the Referees' Association.

21:24.533 --> 21:28.245
[Pino] And his linesman, Aniello Di Mauro,
had an even worse fate.

21:29.246 --> 21:31.748
We intercepted a call to him

21:31.832 --> 21:35.627
from the Head of the Referees' Assocation,
Paolo Bergamo.

21:37.004 --> 21:38.505
[phone line ringing]

21:38.588 --> 21:43.635
[Paolo] Listen,
this was a refereeing mistake.

21:43.719 --> 21:47.723
As you know, Paparesta went to Serie B.
There will always be repercussions.

21:47.806 --> 21:50.100
[Aniello] No, Paolo, I'm sorry.

21:50.809 --> 21:52.728
You have to believe me.

21:52.811 --> 21:58.150
The only thing I was thinking about
was that it was offside.

21:58.233 --> 22:00.736
I swear on my children!

22:00.819 --> 22:05.490
You have to believe me.
You're humiliating me!

22:08.118 --> 22:13.707
I feel deep compassion for him.
He did his job, he raised the flag.

22:14.916 --> 22:16.960
-[crowd cheering]
-[horn honking]

22:17.961 --> 22:23.216
Their power was so strong, so unchecked,

22:23.300 --> 22:27.888
that they even humiliated people,
even making them cry.

22:30.307 --> 22:33.477
When referees weren't on their side,

22:33.560 --> 22:38.940
like Paparesta, the direction was:
"Butcher them."

22:39.524 --> 22:40.567
[car honks]

22:41.526 --> 22:44.363
[Attilio] This is exactly
what we were trying to prove.

22:44.446 --> 22:49.910
The Referees' Association
was being influenced by Moggi.

22:51.078 --> 22:53.663
[thunder rumbling]

22:57.334 --> 22:58.585
[crow caws]

23:12.599 --> 23:16.311
[Corrado] I work in the Sport section
of la Repubblica.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.229
[door beeps]

23:18.814 --> 23:21.274
My boss thought I was
a bit of a pain in the ass,

23:21.358 --> 23:26.363
because I loved to shed light
on things that were hidden.

23:26.446 --> 23:28.490
I dealt with the dark side of football.

23:31.368 --> 23:35.914
I thought that Luciano Moggi
was very interesting.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.043
He was extremely powerful.

23:41.211 --> 23:45.632
I read everything
that had been written about him.

23:46.800 --> 23:53.181
Everywhere Moggi had been,
there were scandals.

23:53.974 --> 23:58.437
[reporter] Supplying prostitutes.
This is the accusation leveled against

23:58.520 --> 24:00.856
the ex-director of Torino FC,
Luciano Moggi.

24:01.440 --> 24:04.526
The women were asked

24:04.609 --> 24:08.530
to keep the referees happy
before three games.

24:08.613 --> 24:11.366
Moggi completely denies this.

24:13.118 --> 24:18.540
[Corrado] He'd never been found guilty
of anything.

24:20.292 --> 24:24.754
He's a man who was always one step ahead.

24:25.839 --> 24:29.426
[indistinct chattering]

24:29.509 --> 24:32.012
I started looking for sources,

24:32.762 --> 24:37.058
but Juventus
is the most important team in Italy.

24:37.601 --> 24:44.357
To attack them, you must be
absolutely certain of the facts.

24:45.609 --> 24:51.573
If you miss a shot at Luciano Moggi,
you won't get a second chance.

25:01.374 --> 25:04.961
[in English] After Reggina, Juventus were
winning most of their matches.

25:05.545 --> 25:08.882
[Gabriele] But Milan had cut Juve's lead
to four points.

25:09.591 --> 25:11.593
[crowd cheering]

25:20.185 --> 25:22.521
[Pino in Italian]
Around then we ran into a problem.

25:22.604 --> 25:26.483
It had the potential
to derail the whole investigation.

25:29.152 --> 25:34.032
We heard Luciano Moggi
talking with Paolo Bergamo.

25:34.115 --> 25:35.867
[phone line ringing]

25:36.535 --> 25:38.286
[Bergamo] I've had some issues.

25:38.370 --> 25:41.081
I want to talk about it
on the other phone.

25:41.164 --> 25:41.998
[Moggi] Okay.

25:44.376 --> 25:49.381
But Moggi's phone call didn't happen.
We didn't have that conversation recorded,

25:49.464 --> 25:52.425
even though
all Moggi's mobile phones were bugged.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.886
Both mobile and landlines.

25:55.595 --> 25:57.347
It drives you crazy.

25:57.430 --> 25:59.140
Where the hell were they talking?

26:01.518 --> 26:02.686
[phone line ringing]

26:03.603 --> 26:06.189
[Moggi] I'm on the wrong phone,
wait a second.

26:06.273 --> 26:08.900
[man] I'll send you a text
on the other phone.

26:11.403 --> 26:17.909
They must have a system
for talking to each other secretly.

26:18.827 --> 26:20.161
[phone line ringing]

26:20.870 --> 26:22.998
[Moggi] Get two SIM cards.

26:23.081 --> 26:24.249
[man] I got them.

26:24.332 --> 26:27.294
[Moggi] Two anonymous SIM cards.

26:31.006 --> 26:35.051
We realized that this group
had their most secret calls

26:35.135 --> 26:37.262
using secret burner phones.

26:38.305 --> 26:44.477
We'd only ever seen this before
with organized crime gangs.

26:45.270 --> 26:50.859
Maybe they'd been tipped off
about the investigation.

26:53.320 --> 26:59.951
Juventus was about to play
a very important match against Milan,

27:00.952 --> 27:05.540
but we didn't hear any phone calls
about that match.

27:07.334 --> 27:10.587
We were left in total darkness.
Total darkness.

27:17.969 --> 27:19.971
[crowd cheering]

27:23.600 --> 27:25.935
[commentator] This championship is already

27:26.019 --> 27:29.522
a two-horse race for the title
between Juventus and Milan.

27:43.620 --> 27:45.622
[Gabriele in English]
Juventus are top of the league,

27:45.705 --> 27:47.457
but their lead is just four points.

27:49.000 --> 27:52.462
If Milan won the match, then it would
blow the title race wide open.

27:53.630 --> 27:56.925
[commentator in Italian]
These are two strong, determined teams.

27:57.884 --> 28:00.136
Milan and Juventus, the moment of truth.

28:04.641 --> 28:07.519
[in English] There weren't many chances,
it was a close game,

28:07.602 --> 28:11.564
but there were two big decisions
that go against Milan.

28:13.983 --> 28:14.818
[crowd roars]

28:14.901 --> 28:16.528
[commentator 1] That's a pull from Zebina.

28:16.611 --> 28:18.822
[commentator 2] Certainly was, yeah,
and I think, uh,

28:18.905 --> 28:21.991
if the referee had spotted that,
we could well be looking at a penalty.

28:24.744 --> 28:27.956
Now, that should have been a penalty
straight away, to Milan, but it wasn't.

28:31.501 --> 28:35.672
[Gabriele] Late on, Kaká is fouled,
but stays on his feet,

28:35.755 --> 28:37.549
has the ball, is clear on goal.

28:37.632 --> 28:38.466
[whistle blows]

28:39.300 --> 28:41.469
-[comm 1] The whistle's gone--
-[comm 2] A poor decision.

28:41.553 --> 28:44.973
[comm 1] It's held them up, hasn't it?
There was a clear advantage for Milan.

28:45.473 --> 28:50.729
They were absolutely furious,
because it was just bad refereeing.

28:50.812 --> 28:52.313
[crowd roaring]

28:52.397 --> 28:53.857
[commentator 2] So frustrating, that.

28:53.940 --> 28:57.277
Especially with chances at a premium,
a real opportunity for Kaká.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.658
[Mina] It ended nil-nil, but Milan
should have won that match.

29:04.284 --> 29:07.036
Juventus went into the new year
at the top of the table.

29:08.788 --> 29:10.957
[in Italian]
Wait a second, he's on the phone.

29:17.630 --> 29:20.800
-[seagulls squawk]
-[church bell tolling]

29:26.181 --> 29:30.602
[Pino] We were halfway through the season,

29:30.685 --> 29:35.815
but we still didn't have enough evidence
against Moggi,

29:37.233 --> 29:42.071
because they were using burner phones.

29:43.531 --> 29:50.455
So, we got the team started
on video surveillance

29:50.538 --> 29:53.416
to film the people he met.

29:56.169 --> 29:57.420
[grunts]

29:57.504 --> 29:58.838
[man] He's coming on foot?

30:00.507 --> 30:02.050
At the top of the road?

30:05.011 --> 30:09.057
[Pino] Moggi was meeting members

30:09.140 --> 30:12.977
of the football federation,

30:13.061 --> 30:18.066
financiers and journalists.

30:22.529 --> 30:25.740
We were shocked to find out that he was

30:25.824 --> 30:29.619
driven around by police officers.

30:32.914 --> 30:36.167
This gave us an idea of the extent

30:36.251 --> 30:40.046
of Luciano Moggi's power.

30:49.889 --> 30:54.352
Then, out of the blue,
we catch Moggi on wiretap

30:55.770 --> 30:58.857
speaking to referee administrator,
Paolo Bergamo.

30:59.983 --> 31:01.568
[phone line ringing]

31:01.651 --> 31:04.320
-[Moggi] Hello?
-[Bergamo] I'm on the house number.

31:05.947 --> 31:10.159
[Pino] Moggi slips up
and uses a burner phone

31:10.243 --> 31:14.622
to speak on a wire-tapped number.

31:15.415 --> 31:21.045
Thank God even the smartest people
make mistakes.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.300
[Moggi] I'll tell you what I've written.

31:25.383 --> 31:29.220
Okay, I've done Juventus, Udinese,
Reginna, Milan.

31:29.304 --> 31:30.138
[Bergamo] Yes.

31:31.389 --> 31:35.727
Bergamo is in charge of the draw
for selecting referees.

31:36.769 --> 31:40.732
[Moggi] And these are the referees
I've put in this grid.

31:40.815 --> 31:44.861
I've got Bertini, Rodomonti and Racalbuto.

31:45.486 --> 31:48.907
This grid works for me.

31:52.577 --> 31:56.873
[Gabriele in English] In Italy, they would
have a draw to assign the referee

31:56.956 --> 32:00.627
and they'd take all the matches,
they split them into tiers,

32:00.710 --> 32:02.378
and then they have a draw.

32:03.755 --> 32:09.052
The system is designed to make sure
that it's extremely difficult for a club

32:09.135 --> 32:12.180
to influence what referee
gets assigned to their match.

32:13.264 --> 32:16.100
It takes place
on a Friday morning in Rome.

32:16.184 --> 32:17.685
ITALIAN FOOTBALL FEDERATION

32:17.769 --> 32:23.858
[in Italian] Bergamo and Moggi spoke
on Tuesday saying,

32:23.942 --> 32:27.612
"This referee here, that one there.
No, change it around."

32:27.695 --> 32:30.448
"Bertini is fine for me,"
that is for Moggi.

32:30.531 --> 32:35.745
So, we really wanted to find out
what would happen.

32:35.828 --> 32:38.039
[tense music playing]

32:45.338 --> 32:48.132
[laughing] On Friday,
we were completely shocked.

32:51.844 --> 32:52.845
Rodomonti.

32:53.763 --> 32:58.559
We went to check.
To our surprise, it was that list.

32:59.352 --> 33:03.815
[Pino] The same list
that Moggi had given a few days earlier.

33:04.482 --> 33:05.316
Bertini.

33:07.193 --> 33:13.491
Either Luciano Moggi was one of the most
extraordinary clairvoyants in history,

33:13.574 --> 33:17.745
uh, or something else was going on.

33:19.330 --> 33:22.709
[Attilio] We thought that
the referee selection

33:22.792 --> 33:28.548
was entirely arranged by Moggi
and the referee administrator.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.759
It was disturbing.

33:34.137 --> 33:39.600
For us, this was one of
the most important pieces of evidence

33:39.684 --> 33:45.273
to prove that we were dealing
with an organized crime group.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.567
[church bell tolling]

33:47.650 --> 33:54.032
Moggi's secret system wasn't a myth.
It was absolutely real.

34:01.956 --> 34:03.291
[ominous music playing]

34:03.374 --> 34:07.587
[Gabriele in English] 2005 starts
with Juventus actually losing some ground.

34:08.212 --> 34:10.131
[Mina] That meant
that they lost their position

34:10.214 --> 34:12.050
at the top of the table to Milan.

34:13.384 --> 34:16.637
This made for a very exciting title race.

34:17.513 --> 34:20.183
[Gabriele] Everybody believes
it's going down to the wire.

34:28.483 --> 34:29.692
[phone line ringing]

34:31.027 --> 34:32.945
-[Pierluigi in Italian] Hi.
-[Moggi] Gigi.

34:33.029 --> 34:35.865
What fucking referee
are you sending us?

34:37.533 --> 34:40.369
[Pino] Once we realized that Luciano Moggi

34:40.453 --> 34:45.041
was manipulating
the selection of referees,

34:46.042 --> 34:48.586
a whole different world
opened up before us.

34:49.504 --> 34:54.884
We realized it was even more complex
than we thought.

34:55.593 --> 35:01.307
Their work was so sophisticated
it didn't leave anything to chance.

35:05.978 --> 35:12.235
Moggi was trying to influence games
that had nothing to do with Juventus.

35:15.363 --> 35:17.573
We didn't understand why.

35:18.950 --> 35:20.201
[crowd chanting]

35:20.284 --> 35:21.410
[phone line ringing]

35:22.161 --> 35:25.706
[Moggi] For the Fiorentina vs
Bologna game,

35:25.790 --> 35:28.084
I need the yellow cards to do their work.

35:29.001 --> 35:29.836
[whistle blows]

35:29.919 --> 35:35.007
Luciano Moggi clearly says,
"Go ahead with the yellow cards."

35:36.926 --> 35:40.138
[in English] When you accumulate
a certain number of yellow cards,

35:40.221 --> 35:43.099
you get an automatic one or two match ban.

35:44.475 --> 35:46.352
The referee is Massimo De Santis,

35:46.435 --> 35:49.856
and he ends up booking
three Bologna players,

35:49.939 --> 35:53.317
but crucially,
three of those players were, at the time,

35:53.401 --> 35:56.362
one yellow card away from a suspension.

35:57.822 --> 35:59.949
The next match is against Juventus.

36:01.284 --> 36:02.660
[crowd roaring]

36:04.745 --> 36:06.414
[phone line ringing]

36:06.497 --> 36:10.501
[man in Italian]
De Santis has done the perfect crime.

36:11.752 --> 36:16.757
All three Bologna players suspended.

36:17.341 --> 36:19.010
[Moggi] Yes, thank goodness.

36:23.764 --> 36:26.976
[Pino] When Juventus played Bologna,

36:27.059 --> 36:29.604
who had three key players suspended,

36:31.189 --> 36:32.523
Bologna lost.

36:32.607 --> 36:34.984
[crowd cheering]

36:35.067 --> 36:37.695
It was a very sophisticated system.

36:38.404 --> 36:39.530
Deadly.

36:43.492 --> 36:49.498
By now, we had a clear idea
of the three pillars of Moggi's system:

36:50.291 --> 36:52.460
Choosing referees he wants…

36:55.463 --> 36:59.967
punishing referees who were against him…

37:02.386 --> 37:08.184
and getting referees to suspend players
from teams about to play Juventus.

37:10.436 --> 37:14.440
Thanks to the Moggi system,
at the end of the championship,

37:14.523 --> 37:19.403
Juventus are close to winning the League.

37:35.419 --> 37:38.589
[Mina in English] It was the end
of the season, and Juventus and Milan

37:38.673 --> 37:39.715
were neck and neck.

37:43.594 --> 37:46.305
So, it all came down
to this big match in Milan.

37:48.808 --> 37:51.602
[commentator 1 in Italian] We haven't seen
a battle like this for years.

37:51.686 --> 37:56.524
With the two teams neck and neck,
this game is basically a final.

37:58.317 --> 38:01.696
[in English] Whoever won that match
would effectively win the title.

38:01.779 --> 38:05.992
[commentator 2 in Italian]
This is going out to 167 countries.

38:06.075 --> 38:08.369
[commentator 1] It's gonna be
a great match. Pure football.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.037
May the best team win.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.581
[Gabriele in English] There was
tremendous hype going into it,

38:12.665 --> 38:14.083
tremendous tension.

38:14.166 --> 38:16.877
[commentator 1 in Italian]
Whoever wins this will be champions.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.427
[horn honking]

38:25.344 --> 38:31.267
[Attilio] Collina was chosen as referee.
He was a top referee. He was impartial.

38:32.768 --> 38:36.564
We knew that Luciano Moggi
didn't want Collina.

38:37.773 --> 38:39.317
[phone line ringing]

38:39.400 --> 38:40.651
[Moggi] Good evening.

38:40.735 --> 38:45.031
[Pierluigi] Evening, Luciano. I hear
you're pissed off about the referees.

38:45.114 --> 38:49.827
[Moggi] No, the pitch is our only friend.

38:49.910 --> 38:52.747
If we win, we win.

38:55.041 --> 39:00.588
[Pino] The battle of the giants
couldn't be influenced by Moggi.

39:03.591 --> 39:07.053
The owner of Milan was Berlusconi.

39:07.136 --> 39:09.347
With his media power and economic might,

39:10.181 --> 39:12.892
no other referee would have
taken on the responsibility.

39:13.476 --> 39:16.937
Because the match was so big.

39:21.901 --> 39:23.027
[whistle blows]

39:36.332 --> 39:38.334
[Gabriele in English] Del Piero delivers
a pinpoint cross,

39:38.417 --> 39:41.379
and David Trezeguet was there to meet it.

39:41.462 --> 39:45.591
[commentator 1 in Italian]
David Trezeguet! One-nil!

39:45.674 --> 39:47.510
[commentator 2]
What a cross from Del Piero!

39:55.476 --> 39:59.271
[in English] The rest of the match Milan
strained forward, trying to get an edge.

40:03.442 --> 40:04.819
[commentator 1 in Italian] Inzaghi!

40:04.902 --> 40:06.612
[crowd roars]

40:06.695 --> 40:10.658
There's Buffon. Inzaghi hits the post!

40:10.741 --> 40:13.953
[crowd cheering]

40:15.287 --> 40:16.247
[whistle blows]

40:26.549 --> 40:31.345
The match is over! Juventus won,
and probably the championship, too.

40:31.429 --> 40:33.514
They're three points ahead of Milan now.

40:36.559 --> 40:39.353
[in English] Winning that match meant
winning the title.

40:42.857 --> 40:44.859
[commentator 2 in Italian]
Del Piero lifts the trophy.

40:44.942 --> 40:48.320
They're champions of Italy
for the 28th time.

40:53.659 --> 40:55.119
[Gabriele in English] Moggi's vindicated.

40:56.078 --> 40:58.497
He, once again, was dominating Serie A.

41:00.708 --> 41:03.002
[horns honking]

41:06.630 --> 41:08.507
[Vincenzo in Italian] It was amazing.

41:09.341 --> 41:11.218
It was like having a baby. [laughs]

41:12.136 --> 41:15.848
I came back home with tears in my eyes.

41:22.354 --> 41:26.567
[Pino] Everyone was celebrating,
but only we knew that it was a deception.

41:27.651 --> 41:30.529
It was a great fraud.

41:31.739 --> 41:35.284
[Attilio] As a fan,
I thought it was a dirty result.

41:36.410 --> 41:42.541
It's fake. It's like doping.
What sort of achievement is that?

41:48.672 --> 41:54.762
[Pino] We had collected
about 171,000 phone calls.

41:55.679 --> 41:59.600
It was an enormous task
to go through them all.

42:00.809 --> 42:04.480
At that point, we had enough evidence

42:04.563 --> 42:08.776
to take them to court.

42:11.529 --> 42:16.700
Everything had to remain
completely confidential

42:16.784 --> 42:22.164
until we were ready
to issue arrest warrants.

42:50.025 --> 42:53.195
[Corrado]
It's 6:00 p.m., I'm in the newsroom.

42:55.406 --> 42:59.743
I get a phone call from a close friend.

43:01.203 --> 43:03.038
He says, "Corrado, I have some documents."

43:03.831 --> 43:08.085
The documents came from the police.
They arrived from a confidential source.

43:10.337 --> 43:12.339
[laughs] Okay. See you later.

43:13.674 --> 43:19.847
We discovered it was about Luciano Moggi
and the last Serie A football seasons.

43:20.514 --> 43:23.309
We were all a bit shocked,

43:23.392 --> 43:27.104
because we realized
we had a massive story.

43:27.855 --> 43:32.067
The charges included organized crime,

43:32.151 --> 43:39.074
which was unheard of in sports.
It's normally only for Mafia cases.

43:40.784 --> 43:44.121
The office was electrified,
but we were a bit worried.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.624
It was very late.
To re-do the whole newspaper,

43:46.707 --> 43:48.292
at that time, is a big deal.

43:49.793 --> 43:52.546
The first edition, in those years,
closed at 11:00 p.m.

43:53.047 --> 43:57.801
So, we had three or four hours to read,
maybe an hour to write.

43:59.261 --> 44:04.975
But we work better under pressure,
and amazingly, we made it happen.

44:05.059 --> 44:06.101
[typing]

44:09.021 --> 44:10.773
Italian football exploded.

44:11.982 --> 44:14.526
[dramatic music playing]

44:14.610 --> 44:15.611
MASSIVE SCANDAL!

44:15.694 --> 44:20.824
[man 1] Breaking news. Leaked wiretaps
name famous Italian football executives.

44:20.908 --> 44:23.786
The disaster at Juventus
is all over the front pages.

44:23.869 --> 44:25.079
"Juve in chaos."

44:25.162 --> 44:26.497
Good evening from Rai Sport.

44:26.580 --> 44:31.168
The storm engulfing Italian Football
is growing.

44:31.752 --> 44:33.837
[man 2 in English] Luciano Moggi is
the central figure

44:33.921 --> 44:35.714
in Italy's match-fixing scandal.

44:36.924 --> 44:39.551
Police believe their phone taps
have revealed a system of corruption

44:39.635 --> 44:40.719
at the highest level.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.726
[Gabriele] The scandal was seismic.

44:47.810 --> 44:50.979
Originally, they called it Moggopoli,
after Moggi.

44:51.480 --> 44:53.023
Then it became Calciopoli,

44:53.107 --> 44:56.318
effectively the equivalent
of "Footballgate."

44:59.238 --> 45:02.991
[in Italian]
It was the biggest ever football scandal.

45:04.076 --> 45:06.704
[man 3] Moggi is also accused
of kidnapping.

45:06.787 --> 45:10.165
They are accused of locking the referee,
Paparesta, in the changing rooms.

45:10.249 --> 45:13.085
MOGGI ACCUSED OF KIDNAPPING

45:13.168 --> 45:17.423
That someone could go as far as
kidnapping a referee was unbelievable.

45:17.506 --> 45:20.884
It sounded like a Mexican Narcos story.

45:23.262 --> 45:25.139
[man 2 in English]
Aldo Biscardi has stepped down

45:25.222 --> 45:28.475
after decades presenting one
of Italy's longest-running TV shows.

45:30.853 --> 45:32.855
[man 4 in Italian]
The so-called "Moggi system"

45:32.938 --> 45:34.773
is summarized in 2,400 pages,

45:34.857 --> 45:38.569
and there are also 10,000 wiretaps
and video surveillance.

45:38.652 --> 45:41.029
-[indistinct chattering]
-[cameras clicking]

45:44.450 --> 45:47.161
I wasn't angry, I was furious.

45:48.746 --> 45:53.709
[Pino] It caused huge, irreparable damage
to our investigation.

45:55.210 --> 45:59.590
We'd never had a leak before.

45:59.673 --> 46:00.632
Never.

46:01.216 --> 46:03.135
All of our work was at risk,

46:03.218 --> 46:10.184
and for the first time,
Luciano Moggi knew we were onto him.

46:13.145 --> 46:15.147
[ominous music playing]

46:35.751 --> 46:37.252
[dragging]

46:44.259 --> 46:46.345
-[man] Here we are.
-Here we are.

46:46.428 --> 46:49.640
[man] With that cigar,
you look like a boss.

46:50.808 --> 46:52.392
-And--
-A phony one.

46:53.018 --> 46:57.064
[man] Why did they call you Lucky Luciano?

46:57.147 --> 47:00.150
They didn't call me Lucky Luciano,
they called me Lucky.

47:00.901 --> 47:05.113
But luck doesn't just happen.
You have to look for it.

47:05.906 --> 47:10.077
The first ten days
of the scandal were awful

47:10.160 --> 47:14.581
because TV, radio, newspapers,

47:14.665 --> 47:19.711
all repeating, "Scandal in football"
all the time.

47:21.255 --> 47:23.799
I've never taken advantage of anyone.

47:23.882 --> 47:27.219
To be accused of being a thief,
it hurt me.

47:30.264 --> 47:32.641
I grew up in poverty.

47:32.724 --> 47:35.435
My dad worked as a lumberjack.

47:36.603 --> 47:41.567
I've always had something inside
that pushed me

47:41.650 --> 47:44.903
and told me, "Go. Go on."

47:45.737 --> 47:48.782
And so I pursued my dream,
my passion for football.

47:50.534 --> 47:56.665
Football is a pure sport
in which the best players win.

47:57.332 --> 48:02.713
If we won seven championships,
I think that's a big achievement.

48:03.463 --> 48:07.843
All the players I signed,
from Zidane to Pavel Nedved,

48:07.926 --> 48:10.178
to Cannavaro, they were the right ones.

48:10.971 --> 48:12.222
[cell phone vibrates]

48:13.307 --> 48:14.975
-Oh.
-[man talks indistinctly]

48:21.023 --> 48:24.192
We didn't need anyone's help
to win games.

48:24.276 --> 48:26.236
We won with our own strength.

48:26.820 --> 48:29.740
When you're at the top of the tree,
everyone at the bottom

48:29.823 --> 48:31.575
is trying to shoot you down.

48:36.204 --> 48:38.165
[seagulls squawk]

48:38.248 --> 48:41.084
[Pino] The leak forced us
to take action immediately.

48:42.085 --> 48:44.546
We had to do it all in a crazy rush.

48:44.630 --> 48:48.800
So, we subpoenaed the suspects.

48:49.968 --> 48:52.554
Most importantly, Luciano Moggi.

48:54.139 --> 48:58.310
Juventus is in the spotlight again.

48:58.393 --> 49:01.063
Today, Moggi will be interrogated.

49:01.146 --> 49:03.690
He's just arrived in Rome.

49:03.774 --> 49:07.694
He's on his way
to the police headquarters.

49:12.199 --> 49:13.617
[Pino] I was stressed.

49:14.826 --> 49:18.330
It was as if time and space had stopped…

49:19.957 --> 49:25.212
because Italy was desperate to know
what would happen next.

49:25.295 --> 49:27.297
[tense music playing]

49:32.177 --> 49:38.225
Finally, I met Luciano Moggi in person,
up close, for the first time.

49:38.308 --> 49:41.478
The expression on his face was tense.

49:45.941 --> 49:48.443
I struggled to look them in the eyes.

49:48.527 --> 49:50.654
I wanted to find out
what they would accuse me of

49:50.737 --> 49:52.489
since I hadn't done anything wrong.

49:53.031 --> 49:56.868
I didn't know
what they could charge me with.

50:02.666 --> 50:07.629
[Pino] May 15th, 2006…

50:08.463 --> 50:13.427
Before we start asking questions,
is there anything you'd like to say?

50:13.510 --> 50:20.392
[Moggi] I've been attacked by everyone.
I've been made a scapegoat.

50:20.475 --> 50:27.232
I can't accept this.
I have always obeyed the law.

50:28.900 --> 50:31.194
I was certain I was innocent.

50:31.278 --> 50:36.575
He asked us,
"Have I done something wrong?"

50:38.160 --> 50:40.162
"Is this illegal?"

50:40.912 --> 50:45.625
I did talk to the referee administrators.
But so did everyone else.

50:46.626 --> 50:50.422
Of course we try
to look out for ourselves,

50:50.505 --> 50:54.718
because this is something
all football clubs do.

50:56.011 --> 50:57.721
"This is football."

50:58.346 --> 51:01.975
So, we clashed with him,
because we kept saying,

51:02.059 --> 51:04.770
"Look, this is illegal."

51:05.353 --> 51:07.773
And I never asked to win a match.

51:08.648 --> 51:11.735
Look, this is actually a crime.

51:12.778 --> 51:15.280
We are talking about organized crime.

51:15.363 --> 51:16.615
[Moggi] Oh my!

51:16.698 --> 51:22.829
[Pino] So, Paparesta locked
in the changing room…

51:22.913 --> 51:26.208
[Moggi crying] Dear Lord…

51:26.291 --> 51:29.211
[Pino] Mr. Moggi, I want to tell you…

51:29.294 --> 51:33.423
-We have always--
-[Moggi] I have always been a good person,

51:33.507 --> 51:36.593
and now I feel like
I've turned into a Mafia Don!

51:36.676 --> 51:39.137
[crying]

51:44.267 --> 51:49.815
In that moment, he realizes
that the castle is crumbling.

51:52.692 --> 51:58.323
Do you realize your career is over?

52:01.576 --> 52:05.622
-[indistinct chattering]
-[cameras clicking]

52:10.669 --> 52:13.255
Please, don't ask me any questions…

52:14.589 --> 52:18.885
because I don't have the desire
or the strength.

52:18.969 --> 52:21.638
My soul has been killed.

52:24.850 --> 52:30.188
Tomorrow, I will resign
as Sporting Director of Juventus.

52:30.272 --> 52:33.692
From this evening, the world of soccer
is no longer my world.

52:33.775 --> 52:38.155
-[indistinct chattering]
-[cameras clicking]

52:42.868 --> 52:44.870
[crowd yelling]

52:46.496 --> 52:50.000
There have been shocking developments
in the scandal.

52:50.083 --> 52:53.170
The authorities are investigating
nine clubs.

52:53.253 --> 52:55.755
Three might be relegated.

52:56.798 --> 52:58.258
[in English]
The scandal grew week on week,

52:58.341 --> 53:02.012
and the Italian Federation
moved very quickly.

53:02.679 --> 53:07.601
[in Italian] Juventus FC are relegated.

53:07.684 --> 53:10.604
The Serie A titles are revoked.

53:12.314 --> 53:14.024
[man in English] A.C. Milan remain
in Serie A,

53:14.107 --> 53:16.610
but will have 15 points deducted.

53:16.693 --> 53:19.613
[Gabriele] All of a sudden,
you have Milan given a big points penalty.

53:19.696 --> 53:21.573
You have Lazio
with a big points penalty,

53:21.656 --> 53:25.452
and Juventus relegated, uh,
from the top flight,

53:25.535 --> 53:28.288
stripping them of two titles
that they'd won.

53:29.206 --> 53:32.876
[man] Tonight, the verdict was greeted
in Turin with anger and defiance.

53:32.959 --> 53:34.544
[crowd chanting]

53:34.628 --> 53:38.590
[Gabriele] There was an exodus
of top players leaving to go abroad.

53:39.841 --> 53:42.510
[man] Juventus stand to lose
some of their star players

53:42.594 --> 53:44.888
in what could be the sale of the century.

53:45.597 --> 53:50.560
[in Italian] All football fans are victims
of this sickness in football.

53:51.603 --> 53:53.271
This has destroyed football.

53:53.355 --> 53:58.652
As a fan, and as a person
who works in the world of football,

53:58.735 --> 53:59.819
it's terrifying.

54:00.403 --> 54:03.198
Don't you think it's a metaphor
for Italy today?

54:03.281 --> 54:05.742
No, absolutely not.

54:05.825 --> 54:09.329
This is something that's restricted
to a small part of football.

54:12.540 --> 54:16.169
[Pino] Moggi's resignation
was the end of an era.

54:17.254 --> 54:20.215
But for us, only one thing was important:

54:20.298 --> 54:24.594
taking him to court
and proving he was guilty.

54:37.482 --> 54:40.944
[Moggi] I felt pretty broken.

54:49.286 --> 54:51.955
I was even ashamed to walk on the street.

54:53.707 --> 54:59.337
It was as if a house had fallen on me.

55:00.338 --> 55:02.299
This team was my masterpiece.

55:06.553 --> 55:09.222
In that moment, I thought of many things.

55:11.766 --> 55:13.685
It's important to say,

55:13.768 --> 55:18.523
it included committing suicide,
because I was really…

55:24.904 --> 55:29.284
But religion taught me
that life is made of many moments,

55:29.367 --> 55:30.910
beautiful and bad.

55:31.578 --> 55:34.789
And you have to fight through
the bad ones.

55:37.959 --> 55:43.381
In my darkest moment,
I felt an inner strength

55:43.465 --> 55:45.800
which said, "You must fight."

55:45.884 --> 55:52.766
"Show the world
that everything being said is untrue."

56:04.361 --> 56:07.906
[piano music playing]

56:11.659 --> 56:13.495
[man] Now the Calciopoli scandal:

56:13.578 --> 56:17.415
Juventus' former Sporting Director
is on trial.

56:21.961 --> 56:25.965
We'll start the hearings now.

56:27.675 --> 56:29.386
[Moggi] I believe in justice.

56:29.469 --> 56:33.014
I believe in a fair world,

56:34.224 --> 56:38.812
but when I read that motto,
"The Law is Equal for All,"

56:38.895 --> 56:40.605
I had my doubts.

56:41.314 --> 56:46.152
Because even if this was a scandal,
all of football should have been on trial,

56:46.236 --> 56:48.738
not just a small part of it.

56:49.406 --> 56:50.782
Not just me.

56:53.618 --> 56:57.288
I'm here to say I'm being portrayed…

56:59.249 --> 57:03.628
as the head of a system
which I've never been part of.

57:06.464 --> 57:09.050
[Pino] We had hundreds of thousands
of wiretaps,

57:09.634 --> 57:13.680
but we needed witnesses.

57:14.514 --> 57:17.058
I just wanted to understand why…

57:17.142 --> 57:20.937
officials who made decisions
against Juventus didn't referee anymore.

57:21.020 --> 57:24.524
Did you ever receive threats
from Luciano Moggi?

57:24.607 --> 57:28.820
He said, "Be careful, you piece of shit,
or you'll end up in a bad way."

57:28.903 --> 57:34.909
-[male lawyer] Objection!
-Lawyers, please calm down!

57:37.328 --> 57:40.248
They told me I was a disgrace,

57:41.332 --> 57:46.004
that they were appalled by my refereeing.

57:49.674 --> 57:53.470
Moggi's statements are quite dramatic.
He says, "I locked the referee

57:53.553 --> 57:56.306
in the changing room and took the keys."

57:56.806 --> 58:01.686
I don't think the door was locked.

58:02.604 --> 58:05.732
This never happened.

58:08.568 --> 58:09.527
[chuckles]

58:09.611 --> 58:11.779
[Moggi] I made a joke.

58:11.863 --> 58:13.615
I didn't actually do it.

58:14.532 --> 58:18.578
Moggi jokingly said he'd locked him
in the changing room.

58:19.412 --> 58:21.748
He was accused of kidnapping!

58:23.249 --> 58:24.834
Kidnapping!

58:25.627 --> 58:27.921
This whole trial has been done like this.

58:28.004 --> 58:31.549
Some bullshit is said on the phone,
pardon my language,

58:31.633 --> 58:33.635
and an accusation is based on this?

58:37.138 --> 58:41.893
[Attilio] The media coverage was
on Moggi's side,

58:41.976 --> 58:45.396
making out he was the victim

58:45.480 --> 58:49.526
and we were the crazy ones.

58:49.609 --> 58:53.321
If they want a war,
we'll give them a war.

58:54.572 --> 58:58.326
[crowd chanting]
Luciano Moggi! Luciano Moggi!

59:00.662 --> 59:03.331
[Moggi] Yeah,
the fans definitely supported me,

59:03.414 --> 59:08.878
but not only Juventus fans,
because people with common sense

59:08.962 --> 59:14.842
realized that there was no truth
to what they were saying.

59:14.926 --> 59:17.053
[upbeat music playing]

59:17.136 --> 59:18.888
Moggi is innocent!

59:18.972 --> 59:20.306
THANKS FOR EXISTING

59:26.354 --> 59:30.191
That Luciano Moggi
was completely different

59:30.275 --> 59:34.612
from the person I had met face-to-face.

59:36.072 --> 59:40.827
He was confident and had control
over everything around him.

59:42.036 --> 59:47.041
This is not a trial.
This is a ruthless witch hunt.

59:50.003 --> 59:53.464
It was not true that the Moggi system
controlled football.

59:53.548 --> 59:55.341
It was the way football worked, generally.

59:56.467 --> 1:00:00.763
The other football teams spoke
to the referees and the designators.

1:00:00.847 --> 1:00:06.603
This was completely left out
by the public prosecutors.

1:00:08.771 --> 1:00:12.400
We've got about 2,000 wiretaps
of other Sporting Directors

1:00:12.483 --> 1:00:14.444
calling the Referees' Association.

1:00:16.029 --> 1:00:21.826
Only the part about Juventus came out.

1:00:23.453 --> 1:00:26.497
It's not in the report
because it wasn't relevant

1:00:26.581 --> 1:00:28.458
to our investigation.

1:00:30.877 --> 1:00:34.255
[man 1] Moggi's defense argued
there was no conspiracy,

1:00:34.339 --> 1:00:37.258
so, either everyone is guilty,
or everyone is innocent.

1:00:39.636 --> 1:00:44.974
[man 2] Moggi was the ideal scapegoat
for the world of football,

1:00:45.058 --> 1:00:48.770
a world that wanted to clean up its image

1:00:48.853 --> 1:00:52.440
by sacrificing Luciano Moggi.

1:00:54.233 --> 1:00:55.777
[exhales]

1:00:55.860 --> 1:01:02.784
[Pino] I was constantly worried
that our case had been damaged.

1:01:03.743 --> 1:01:05.828
It was a tough time.

1:01:18.424 --> 1:01:20.009
[man] The big day has arrived.

1:01:20.677 --> 1:01:25.848
They will be announcing the verdict
in the Calciopoli trial.

1:01:27.684 --> 1:01:32.146
For Luciano Moggi,
the moment of truth has arrived.

1:01:34.190 --> 1:01:36.943
[Pino] Nothing like this
had ever been done before,

1:01:37.527 --> 1:01:41.906
so nobody could predict the verdict.

1:01:43.533 --> 1:01:45.535
[ominous music playing]

1:02:06.806 --> 1:02:09.308
[woman] In accordance with article 29
of the criminal code,

1:02:10.268 --> 1:02:13.604
Luciano Moggi is found guilty.

1:02:13.688 --> 1:02:17.358
Luciano Moggi, this court sentences you
to five years and four months in prison.

1:02:27.410 --> 1:02:30.538
[Moggi] I was so pleased.

1:02:31.873 --> 1:02:38.171
The verdict silenced all the critics.

1:02:39.380 --> 1:02:41.466
COURT OF LAW

1:02:41.549 --> 1:02:42.800
[Moggi] The truth won.

1:03:07.533 --> 1:03:09.994
Bibi. Hey, hey.

1:03:13.998 --> 1:03:16.417
[babbling]

1:03:16.501 --> 1:03:19.086
You've been released.

1:03:19.170 --> 1:03:22.673
[woman laughs]
You're not locked up anymore.

1:03:23.758 --> 1:03:26.969
-You're free now. Yes.
-[laughs]

1:03:38.606 --> 1:03:42.235
I proved that I was innocent.

1:03:43.361 --> 1:03:48.032
If no matches were fixed,
if the referees were all acquitted,

1:03:48.825 --> 1:03:52.703
was football really broken?

1:03:56.415 --> 1:03:59.210
[Gabriele in English] Of all the referees
and officials caught up in the scandal,

1:03:59.293 --> 1:04:03.798
Massimo De Santis was the only one
whose conviction was upheld.

1:04:04.924 --> 1:04:08.344
Everybody else who was convicted
was either acquitted on appeal,

1:04:08.427 --> 1:04:13.349
or, because so much time had elapsed,
the statute of limitations kicked in

1:04:13.432 --> 1:04:15.768
and their convictions were written off.

1:04:21.524 --> 1:04:25.236
[Moggi in Italian]
Those who led the Calciopoli trial

1:04:25.319 --> 1:04:27.738
will have to face a different judge

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:32.410
with no chance for appeal.

1:04:33.286 --> 1:04:36.414
Jesus Christ. He's the Supreme Judge.

1:04:36.914 --> 1:04:38.457
[cell phone vibrates]

1:04:40.001 --> 1:04:41.085
Hello.

1:04:42.003 --> 1:04:45.339
Listen, I'll tell you something.

1:04:45.840 --> 1:04:50.344
You could try the ex-Juventus player.

1:04:50.428 --> 1:04:52.972
Okay. Bye.

1:05:02.148 --> 1:05:06.235
Who knows what Moggi is doing now?

1:05:07.653 --> 1:05:09.280
Life goes on.

1:05:11.282 --> 1:05:13.284
[piano music playing]

1:05:14.785 --> 1:05:16.704
When I watch a match now,

1:05:17.496 --> 1:05:21.208
I'm never sure…

1:05:22.668 --> 1:05:25.713
they're totally clean.

1:05:29.383 --> 1:05:33.596
This case has totally changed

1:05:33.679 --> 1:05:38.184
my perspective on football…

1:05:39.268 --> 1:05:41.020
and revealed its dark side.

1:06:04.210 --> 1:06:08.422
[opera music playing]
