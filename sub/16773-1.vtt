02:46.261 --> 02:48.007
Captain Red!
Capt...

03:03.278 --> 03:06.197
The hook, the hook!

04:40.375 --> 04:43.294
- Was that you?
- What?

04:43.378 --> 04:50.301
I thought I heard...
It sounded like... a pig.

04:53.388 --> 04:55.306
Must be the heat.

05:44.439 --> 05:49.360
Now, now, Froggy? Be reasonable.
Come on down, you little baboon.

05:49.444 --> 05:53.364
- You want to eat me. Damn it.
- It's a law of nature...

05:53.448 --> 05:56.367
by thunder!
The strong always eat the weak.

06:00.455 --> 06:04.375
Come on down lad...
make an effort.

06:07.462 --> 06:11.382
- Cannibal!
- Come on, piggy-wiggy.

06:11.466 --> 06:14.385
I'm not piggy, I'm the Frog.

06:22.477 --> 06:25.396
Cannibalism is a mortal sin.

06:25.480 --> 06:28.399
It will bring you bad luck!

06:28.483 --> 06:31.402
You shall writhe in hellfire.

06:31.486 --> 06:36.407
What about confession? What do
you think confession's for?

06:53.508 --> 06:57.428
Sail ho! Sail ho to windward!

07:00.515 --> 07:05.436
Devil take you, Frog,
have I not told you to trust me?

07:05.520 --> 07:09.440
- Am I not proved right again.
- Aye, aye, Cap'n.

07:09.524 --> 07:12.443
Well you're not to forget it,
you little rascal.

07:12.527 --> 07:16.447
Never lose faith in divine
providence... never!

07:28.543 --> 07:31.462
Watch out, lad! The shark, a shark.

07:47.562 --> 07:50.481
'Twas good sport, though,
by thunder, 'twas indeed.

07:50.565 --> 07:54.485
You can have me balls for breakfast
if 'twasn't, what do you say?

07:54.569 --> 07:57.488
Whatever you say, Cap'n.

07:57.572 --> 07:59.490
Then we're both agreed.

08:04.579 --> 08:09.501
Ah-hoy! A-hoy there!

08:11.586 --> 08:17.509
Dang me buttons!
There's a thin slice o' luck!

08:17.592 --> 08:19.511
See her colors?

08:20.595 --> 08:22.514
Spaniard!

08:22.597 --> 08:26.518
Quick, quick... The documents,
for heaven's sake!

08:54.629 --> 08:56.548
Me gold!

09:00.635 --> 09:04.556
- Miserable wretch!
- God will be your ruin, Cap'n.

09:04.639 --> 09:08.560
- It will cost us our heads.
- Easier to live without a head than...

09:08.643 --> 09:10.562
without gold, you numskull.

09:10.645 --> 09:14.566
I fight for hatred or the Spaniard...
I fight for glory, not gold!

09:14.649 --> 09:18.570
A man fights for what he lacks the most.

09:24.659 --> 09:26.578
Shiver me soul!

09:26.661 --> 09:29.581
- What, Cap'n Red?
- "What, Cap'n Red?

09:29.664 --> 09:34.586
What, Cap'n Red?" Can't you see those
whore-sons ain't a-changin' course?

09:34.669 --> 09:39.591
She'll run straight past us, all sail
set and the wind up her tail.

09:39.674 --> 09:42.594
Aye, Cap'n... she's holding course.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.639
Per-perhaps...

10:29.724 --> 10:33.645
'tis a ghost ship?

10:40.735 --> 10:45.657
Ghost or no ghost, we need
a-rescuing', by thunder.

10:45.740 --> 10:48.660
- Ahoy!
-Ahoy there!

10:48.743 --> 10:49.661
Ahoy on deck!

11:44.799 --> 11:48.720
- Here, Frog! I'm stuck!
- Drop the chest, Cap'n!

11:48.803 --> 11:51.723
- Drop the chest!
- Never!

12:07.822 --> 12:09.741
Three.

12:09.824 --> 12:11.743
Four.

12:12.827 --> 12:14.746
Five.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.749
Six.

13:11.886 --> 13:13.805
Quick, quick... Pull.

13:31.906 --> 13:34.826
Pull, damn it...

13:59.934 --> 14:07.859
Help! Help! Here...
Me treasure! Murder!

14:21.956 --> 14:28.880
Five-and-twenty years of
unstintin' toil! All me savings!

15:10.004 --> 15:11.923
Down to the brig with them!

15:44.038 --> 15:47.959
Come over here, and open your lug-holes.

15:49.043 --> 15:54.966
If they should question us remember
this: henceforth, I'm Benjamin Parr...

15:55.049 --> 15:58.970
- of London, understand?
- I understand, Cap'n.

15:59.053 --> 16:02.974
Cotton shipper for Matthew Spencer
and Company, right?

16:03.057 --> 16:08.980
Attacked at night by pirates.
On board the... "The Morning Star".

16:09.063 --> 16:13.985
Sunk with all hands. We're the
sole survivors. Repeat.

16:14.068 --> 16:16.988
Benjamin Parr of London,
cotton shipper of...

16:17.071 --> 16:19.991
Tobacco or vanilla would be better.

16:23.077 --> 16:26.998
- And who might you be, sir?
- Joseph Seraphin Amadeus Boomako.

16:27.081 --> 16:32.003
- Boomako?
- Boomako, ship's cook.

16:32.086 --> 16:36.007
- What the devil are you doin' down here?
- I'm in irons, Captain.

16:39.093 --> 16:42.013
- And why's that, pray?
- Spaniards loco...

16:42.096 --> 16:46.017
they say Boomako poison great
Captain Linares to steal throne.

16:46.100 --> 16:50.021
- Throne? What throne?
- Throne of Kapatek-Anahuac.

16:52.106 --> 16:55.026
Kapatek-Anahuac?

16:56.110 --> 16:57.028
- Here?
- Who?

16:57.111 --> 16:59.030
- The throne.
- Ah, here.

16:59.113 --> 17:02.033
- You've seen it?
- Ah, by little hole.

17:02.116 --> 17:08.039
- Where, for God's sake?
- Here. Put your eye here and you see...

17:42.156 --> 17:47.078
If I may make so bold, they'd look very
well hanging from the yardarm.

17:47.162 --> 17:50.081
Yet you have just informed me that
they were victims of a shipwreck.

17:50.165 --> 17:54.085
A pair of dogs, Your Honor!
An Englishman and a Frenchman!

17:54.169 --> 17:58.089
Lieutenant, I would remind you once
and for all, that the war is over.

17:58.173 --> 18:01.092
- On paper, perhaps.
- When a treaty bears...

18:01.176 --> 18:04.095
the sign manual of
His Most Catholic Majesty...

18:04.179 --> 18:10.101
personal sentiments must take second
place to national obligations.

18:10.185 --> 18:16.107
- You Honor's vinegar purge.
- Another! 'Tis the fourth today.

18:16.191 --> 18:20.111
I assure you, doctor, I have naught
left inside me to be purged of.

18:20.195 --> 18:25.116
And Spain's present obligations are
clearly defined by the Treaty...

18:25.200 --> 18:29.120
- of Pyrenees...
- It will get cold, Your Honor.

18:29.204 --> 18:35.126
which treaty expresses the will of our
noble King Philip the Fou... ourth...

18:35.210 --> 18:39.130
A treaty signed by His Excellency
Cardinal Mazarin...

18:39.214 --> 18:44.135
to the greater glory of our country
and the honor of our Holy Mother...

18:44.219 --> 18:46.137
the Church.

18:47.222 --> 18:49.140
Tut, tut...

18:49.224 --> 18:53.144
- we haven't eaten our oatmeal.
- Quite possibly.

18:53.228 --> 18:58.149
So we need look no further should Your
Honor have no movement of the bowels.

19:09.244 --> 19:12.163
Now then. You were shipwrecked, I am told.

19:12.247 --> 19:17.168
We were indeed, Your Honor, sir, till
divine providence saw fit - Dio gratis,

19:17.252 --> 19:22.173
to put us in the way of this here
vessel belonging to the good King...

19:22.257 --> 19:24.175
of Spain.

19:25.260 --> 19:29.180
I see. This shipwreck...
how did it come about?

19:29.264 --> 19:34.185
- Pirates... Devil take 'em!
- Who were these pirates?

19:34.269 --> 19:38.189
'Twere too dark to see, sir.
I did hear 'em shout a name, though...

19:38.273 --> 19:44.195
wait... I think... Ah, I heard
"Cap'n Red, what shall we do with 'em?"

19:44.279 --> 19:49.200
"Kill 'em all," says he. "There's naught
but baccy and vanilla aboard this hulk."

19:49.284 --> 19:53.204
That was our cargo on the
"Morning Star", sir, tobacco and vanilla.

19:53.288 --> 19:57.208
- You heard "Captain Red", are you sure?
- Sure as I've a timber leg, sir.

19:57.292 --> 20:01.212
- He has been dead these past four years.
- Garcia Gomez put an end to him...

20:01.296 --> 20:06.217
at Boca del Toro.
This dog must have been dreaming.

20:06.301 --> 20:10.221
What ain't no dream, Your Honor,
is all I possessed...

20:10.305 --> 20:15.226
went down in that there skirmish.
Homeward bound, I was...

20:15.310 --> 20:22.233
after 18 years a-workin' me fingers to
the bone on a little vanilla plantation.

20:22.317 --> 20:29.240
Life's always dealt me harsh.
Take this cursed leg o' mine;

20:29.324 --> 20:35.246
crushed by a barrel of vanilla at
the tender age of three-and-twenty.

20:35.330 --> 20:37.248
And the scar?

20:37.332 --> 20:41.252
On your head...
was that a barrel of vanilla too?

20:41.336 --> 20:44.255
Not at all, sir, not at all.

20:44.339 --> 20:50.261
That's from the irons they used to pluck
me from me poor late mother's womb.

20:50.345 --> 20:54.265
I 'hope Your Honor gave no such
trouble to his own mother.

20:54.349 --> 20:56.267
Some respect, dog!

21:09.364 --> 21:11.282
Away with them.

21:57.412 --> 22:03.334
Look at it sing,
the tasty little tidbit!

22:03.418 --> 22:07.338
Caramba, I could make
you sing a song or two.

22:07.422 --> 22:11.342
And you wouldn't need your guitarra,
believe me!

22:49.464 --> 22:53.384
Are you not, as I have had the
pleasure of bein' told, the carpenter?

22:53.468 --> 22:55.386
Master Carpenter.

22:55.470 --> 22:59.390
And a fine trade it is, by the power!
Many's the time I've regretted...

22:59.474 --> 23:04.395
not learnin' it myself. Still, too
late now, and there's an end on it.

23:06.481 --> 23:10.401
I perceived your kindly features at
once, master carpenter, and was a...

23:10.485 --> 23:14.405
wonderin' whather pr'aps you might wish to
devote a little of your precious...

23:14.489 --> 23:18.409
- time to me timber leg.
- What's amiss with it?

23:18.493 --> 23:24.415
Cut off short in its prime...
I drift to starboard every step I take.

23:31.506 --> 23:36.427
These are some precious family heirlooms
what I've always refused to...

23:36.511 --> 23:41.432
be parted from, even in times
of direst adversity.

23:42.517 --> 23:45.436
Like this one here. 'Twere given me
by me favorite aunt.

23:45.520 --> 23:49.440
- And the other?
- Ah, that one!

23:50.525 --> 23:55.446
Me father gave that to me poor
old mother, God rest her!

24:08.543 --> 24:10.461
Thank you, gentlemen.

24:10.545 --> 24:14.465
I think we have settled matters
insofar as we are able.

24:14.549 --> 24:18.469
Go take some rest and leave me to
prepare for my own, which I warrant...

24:18.553 --> 24:21.472
this time will be a lasting one...
Long live the King!

24:21.556 --> 24:24.475
- Long live Spain!
- Long live the King!

24:24.559 --> 24:27.478
Long live Spain!

24:31.566 --> 24:36.487
- I have done all I could, Your Honor.
- I know, my good Juanito, I know.

24:36.571 --> 24:41.493
Alas, there are times when all is
not enough. Farewell, Doctor.

24:50.585 --> 24:54.506
My son, unburden your soul
to Almighty God.

24:54.589 --> 24:57.509
Confess your sins and repent
of them is humility...

24:57.592 --> 25:01.513
- that they may be forgiven you.
- Ah, my sins... How they haunt me!

25:01.596 --> 25:05.517
We both know, my son, how Satan con
profit from a sailor's isolation...

25:05.600 --> 25:08.520
inciting him to shameful
solitary practices.

25:08.603 --> 25:12.524
- I am an old man, Padre...
- Very well, then. There remain greed...

25:12.607 --> 25:15.527
anger, pride, mendacity, sloth...

25:15.610 --> 25:18.530
Let us wrestle with them one by one.

25:18.613 --> 25:22.534
For some time now, I have been plagued
by certain weighty questions which...

25:22.617 --> 25:26.538
hardly pertain to mendacity or sloth.

25:26.621 --> 25:29.541
- What manner of questions?
- Throughout my life I gave fought for...

25:29.624 --> 25:31.543
my King, my country,
and Holy Mother Church.

25:31.626 --> 25:35.547
- And God shall reward you for it.
- I have killed in their name.

25:35.630 --> 25:38.550
- A soldier's duty.
- Aye, but 'tis a sorry duty to kill...

25:38.633 --> 25:41.553
men, women and children for the
sake of a nation's gold.

25:41.636 --> 25:44.556
These are savages...
cannibals, some of them!

25:44.639 --> 25:51.563
- They don't even know the value of gold.
- Value of gold! Kapatek-Anahuac!

25:51.646 --> 25:57.569
Is it God? An eagle?
The sun or the moon?

25:57.652 --> 26:02.574
The throne carries a curse if it is
removed from its rightful place.

26:02.657 --> 26:05.577
The other night... I dreamed...
it was red with blood...

26:05.660 --> 26:09.581
If we were wise we would hurl it overboard...

26:09.664 --> 26:13.585
The Neptune might sit on it
without fear or remorse...

26:13.668 --> 26:21.593
but we poor mortals... And my ship?
What will become of my men?

26:21.676 --> 26:28.600
Why was I born a Spaniard
and not an Aztec? Why, Padre...

26:28.683 --> 26:33.605
are there never answers to
the questions that truly matter?

26:34.689 --> 26:37.609
Why?

26:45.700 --> 26:51.623
Man that is born of woman hath but a
short time to live and is full of misery.

26:51.706 --> 26:55.627
He cometh up and is cut down like a
flower. We beseech Thee, o Lord...

26:55.710 --> 26:58.630
to receive into the depths of this
ocean, upon which he sailed as...

26:58.713 --> 27:03.635
a brave captain and a valiant
soldier, thy faithful servant...

27:03.718 --> 27:08.640
Don José Maria Alonso Ordonez
de Linares y Escobar...

27:08.723 --> 27:11.643
Knight of the Order
of the Holy Cross.

27:19.734 --> 27:25.657
What a creature! Proud as a peacock
and twice as 'andsome.

27:25.740 --> 27:29.661
Ah oui, and those eyes...

27:29.744 --> 27:34.666
they burn like coals of fire. And that skin...

27:35.750 --> 27:39.671
smooth as peach, pardieu!

27:41.756 --> 27:44.676
The Lieutenant, you dunderhead.

27:51.766 --> 27:55.687
Guards, prepare to fire.

27:55.770 --> 27:57.689
Fire!

28:42.817 --> 28:44.736
Come and see this.

28:44.819 --> 28:47.739
Come here and look at this.

28:50.825 --> 28:52.744
Look, look at this.

28:53.995 --> 28:59.792
We'll all die of the plague!

29:02.837 --> 29:04.756
Get back in line, you dogs...

29:07.842 --> 29:10.762
in line, I say!

29:12.847 --> 29:14.766
Yeah.

29:24.859 --> 29:28.780
Hold, hold! I'm not the cook,
I'm his replacement!

29:28.863 --> 29:30.782
I know nothing of this.

29:32.867 --> 29:38.790
I drink to the new Master After God
of His Majesty's good ship "Neptune".

29:38.873 --> 29:43.795
Gentlemen, Don Alfonso Felipe
Salamanca de la Torre.

29:43.878 --> 29:45.797
Don Alfonso!

29:45.880 --> 29:48.800
- Your Honor, mutiny a board.
- A what?

29:48.883 --> 29:53.805
The men found a rat in the soup.
The wrecked is tearing 'em up.

29:54.889 --> 29:57.809
Commander, turn up the guard.

30:00.895 --> 30:04.816
We must fight for the betterment
of our conditions. We must claim...

30:04.899 --> 30:10.822
- our rights.
- All your rights... no exceptions.

30:11.906 --> 30:14.826
- We can beat them, if we stand together.
- Right.

30:14.909 --> 30:17.829
- Unity is strength!
- Right.

30:17.912 --> 30:22.834
- And the soldiers, what about them?
- They are our brothers...

30:22.917 --> 30:26.838
- We will talk to them.
- They are sons of the people, like us.

30:26.921 --> 30:28.840
Right.

30:28.923 --> 30:32.844
The officers have bled us dry. Jesus said...

30:32.927 --> 30:36.848
"'Tis easier for a camel to pass
through the eye of a needle...

30:36.931 --> 30:40.852
than for an officer to enter the
kingdom of heaven."

30:49.944 --> 30:53.865
The armory, lad... to the armory!

31:02.957 --> 31:08.880
Must be somewhere close by here.
Ah, Corporal, we've come to mend a leak.

31:08.963 --> 31:11.883
- Leak?
- Bosun's ordered is to help...

31:11.966 --> 31:15.887
the carpenter. His mates
is down with the squitters.

31:15.970 --> 31:19.891
Must find this leak... 'Tis said to
be close by the armory.

31:19.974 --> 31:22.894
Ah there.

31:28.983 --> 31:30.902
Vive la France!

31:30.985 --> 31:33.905
The keys... see if he's got the keys!

31:39.994 --> 31:43.915
- No keys, Cap'n.
- Out o' the gunport with 'im!

32:14.028 --> 32:19.951
Holy Poker, that would've been
too good to be true!

32:38.052 --> 32:41.973
Here, Froggie, give us a hand.
I'm stuck.

32:42.056 --> 32:45.977
Move a muscle and
I'll blow your brains out.

32:58.072 --> 33:00.992
Cut this quick! Look alive!

33:01.075 --> 33:02.994
These too!

33:26.100 --> 33:26.392
Ship's company! Your Captain will address you.

33:35.109 --> 33:38.029
Now then, what seems to be amiss?

33:41.115 --> 33:44.035
Come now, speak your minds!

33:44.118 --> 33:48.039
There's naught to be afraid of...
this is no galley ship.

33:49.123 --> 33:51.042
Go on, go on, tell him...

33:51.125 --> 33:53.044
Well?

33:53.127 --> 33:55.046
Go on, tell him what happened.

33:55.129 --> 33:58.049
They... they... they're feeding us rats.

33:58.132 --> 34:03.054
- Rats? A rat.
- We want to relieve ourselves in peace.

34:03.137 --> 34:07.058
- We're sick of the whip...
- We want our rights...

34:07.141 --> 34:09.060
we want our rights.

34:09.143 --> 34:13.063
Easy man, easy! Don't all speak at once!

34:13.147 --> 34:16.067
We shall settle this matter amicably.

34:17.150 --> 34:19.070
You...!

34:19.154 --> 34:25.076
You...! You...! And you two over there...

34:25.159 --> 34:31.081
the cripple and his crony.
Over here, all five of you!

34:34.168 --> 34:39.090
The rest of you, back to your posts!
On the count of three...

34:39.174 --> 34:44.094
I shall consider you mutineers and
give the command to fire. One!

34:46.181 --> 34:48.099
Two!

34:51.186 --> 34:53.103
Three!

35:09.204 --> 35:13.124
Gentlemen! It seems we have just
been spared a mutiny occasioned by...

35:13.208 --> 35:17.128
this little rodent,
which fell into the soup.

35:18.213 --> 35:22.133
And what, pray, does our learned
physician make of this?

35:30.225 --> 35:32.143
'Tis boiled?

35:32.227 --> 35:37.148
My late grandfather partook of
several during the siege of...

35:37.232 --> 35:41.152
Cartagena, and never suffered
any ill effects.

35:42.237 --> 35:46.157
- You heard that?
- Aye, sir, we did.

35:46.241 --> 35:49.160
"Never suffered any ill effects".

35:50.245 --> 35:53.164
That is uncommon good news,
you'll allow?

35:53.248 --> 35:57.168
- Aye, uncommon good, but...
- But? Come...

35:57.252 --> 36:00.171
would you represent our surgeon's
grandfather to be a liar?

36:00.255 --> 36:04.175
Nay, sir, I'd as soon
slit me throat.

36:04.259 --> 36:09.180
Then kindly be seated.
You are our guests.

36:49.304 --> 36:53.224
I trust you enjoy
your meal, gentlemen.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.240
Could it be that you do not
fancy Spanish rats?

37:09.324 --> 37:13.244
Why, but we do, sir,
we thinks gold dust of 'em.

37:13.328 --> 37:17.248
- Alas, we have but one.
- I pray you, sir, one will be...

37:17.332 --> 37:21.252
more than suffice...
you are too kind.

37:24.339 --> 37:27.258
Some seasoning for our gourmets.

37:33.348 --> 37:36.267
I fear we have no vanilla...

37:55.370 --> 37:58.289
Would you not prefer the head?

37:58.373 --> 38:03.294
Nay, nay, lad, I wouldn't rob you of it.

39:01.436 --> 39:05.356
To the last morsel,
if you please.

39:06.441 --> 39:13.364
For the love of heaven! Don Alfonso!
You have demonstrated your dominion...

39:13.448 --> 39:16.367
over these wretches.
We have all understood.

39:16.451 --> 39:21.372
Enough now! Stop this cruel jest,
I implore you, stop it at once!

39:25.460 --> 39:28.379
Your desire is our command.

39:36.471 --> 39:38.389
Get it off.

39:58.493 --> 40:01.412
One! Two!

40:02.497 --> 40:05.416
- Three!
- That's it, then.

40:05.500 --> 40:08.419
The whip for him,
the rope for us.

40:08.503 --> 40:12.423
Six! Seven!

40:13.508 --> 40:15.426
Eight!

40:15.510 --> 40:17.428
Nine!

40:18.513 --> 40:21.432
Hail Mary, full of grace, the Lord is
with thee. Blessed art thou amongst...

40:21.516 --> 40:26.437
- women and blessed is the fruit of...
- You might as well pray to a bowsprit.

40:26.521 --> 40:31.442
Hey, hey! No blasphemy, lade...
not at this hour o' the watch.

40:31.526 --> 40:35.446
I do not want to die like a dog.
I have a wife and babes.

40:35.530 --> 40:40.451
- I am still young, young!
- O Jesus, in Thy infinite mercy.

40:40.535 --> 40:45.456
They haven't the spunk of a weevil. We
must get ourselves out of this alone...

40:45.540 --> 40:48.459
- just you Froggie, and myself.
- I'm with you, Captain!

40:48.543 --> 40:51.462
- You're a bullycock.
- I'm with you too!

40:51.546 --> 40:56.467
- And me, and me! What's to be done?
- Number one, stop gabbin'. Number two,

40:56.551 --> 41:00.471
- do as you're told. Where's the dagger?
- In my satch, sir.

41:00.555 --> 41:02.473
Take it, Boomako.

41:03.558 --> 41:05.476
Twenty seven!

41:07.562 --> 41:11.482
That's it, that's it. Cut our ropes,
cook, but have a care...

41:11.566 --> 41:16.488
just beside the knot, and mind
you leave a strand or two.

41:17.572 --> 41:20.492
Having made their peace with Almighty God...

41:20.575 --> 41:24.496
through the offices of Padre Don Antonio
Fuentes, these four mutineers...

41:24.579 --> 41:29.501
are sentenced to be hanged
by the neck until they are dead.

41:30.585 --> 41:34.506
May the Lord have mercy on their souls.

41:34.589 --> 41:39.511
- Shipmates, you shall be avenged.
- Shut up you. You want the rope as well.

41:39.594 --> 41:42.514
Do you want it? Cause you can have it.

41:43.598 --> 41:48.520
My son, unburden your soul
to Almighty God.

41:53.608 --> 41:59.531
At this supreme moment, you must confess
your sins that they may be forgiven you.

41:59.614 --> 42:03.535
Matter of fact, Padre, I'd be glad to
'ave the benefit of your theological...

42:03.618 --> 42:07.539
advice, just in case of accidents.
You never know.

42:07.622 --> 42:13.545
Resign yourself, my son. In a few
moments you will be meeting your Maker.

42:14.629 --> 42:17.549
Well, meantimes...

42:19.634 --> 42:23.555
I should tell you that I had
a mind to eat the Frog...

42:23.638 --> 42:26.558
and I'm a-feared bad luck
may come of it.

42:26.641 --> 42:31.563
God created animals to be eaten by man,
so why not a frog?

42:31.646 --> 42:36.568
- Come, my son, what else besides?
- Beggin' your pardon, Reverend...

42:36.651 --> 42:43.575
but that's the Frog, standing alongside.
'Twas 'im I had a notion to eat.

42:47.662 --> 42:50.582
Now that is a serious matter.

43:24.699 --> 43:26.618
Proceed!

43:42.717 --> 43:44.636
Heave!

44:01.736 --> 44:03.655
Fire!

44:06.741 --> 44:09.661
Down with the officers!

45:01.796 --> 45:06.718
For the love of Jesus,
have pity on him...

45:07.802 --> 45:11.723
No... Have pity.

45:48.843 --> 45:50.762
Frog...

45:52.847 --> 45:54.766
down to the armory, son!
Hurry!

45:55.850 --> 45:58.770
Take some of the lads with you!

47:37.952 --> 47:41.873
Hold them back, hold the door.
Put your weight behind it.

48:32.006 --> 48:34.926
Take them on deck.

49:42.076 --> 49:44.996
At your age... have you no shame?

49:51.085 --> 49:56.007
- Hands off the prisoners!
- Easy now, hombre. If there's enough...

49:56.090 --> 50:00.011
- for one, there's enough for two.
- Here's your shawl.

50:16.110 --> 50:19.030
I beg you to pardon the hole, mam'selle.

50:50.144 --> 50:58.069
Shipmates! Divine Providence
has seen fit to deliver...

50:58.153 --> 51:08.079
this here vessel from the tyranny of
your de-generate Hidalgo masters.

51:08.163 --> 51:15.086
I do hereby take possession of her in
the name of brethren of the coast...

51:15.170 --> 51:19.090
and shall henceforth command her.

51:19.174 --> 51:25.096
I am Captain Thomas
Bartholomew Red!

51:30.185 --> 51:34.105
Mercy, have pity...

51:39.194 --> 51:42.113
Long live Captain Red!

51:42.197 --> 51:50.121
Long live Captain Red!
Long live Captain Red!

52:32.247 --> 52:34.165
'Ap'n... 'Ap'n...!

52:34.249 --> 52:37.168
What are you babbling about,
you bakehead?

52:37.252 --> 52:40.171
- 'Ap'n... 'Ap'n...!
- What captain? Where's that water?

52:40.255 --> 52:43.174
A ghost! A ghost! There, 'Ap'n!

53:59.334 --> 54:06.257
Capt, Captain Red!
Capt... Capt...!

54:07.342 --> 54:12.263
What's the fuss? Aye, 'tis Captain Red
himself, flesh and blood...

54:12.347 --> 54:16.267
so don't stand there gaping. Sooner go
getch us a good bottle of Hollands...

54:16.351 --> 54:19.270
you can see the Captain's
got a thirst on him.

54:22.357 --> 54:26.277
Well, you old shark...

54:26.361 --> 54:32.283
got me 632 doubloons marked down in
that vampire's account-book o' yourn?

54:33.368 --> 54:38.289
Strange you should ask, Captain. I was
just casting an eye over your account...

54:38.373 --> 54:42.293
and indeed, you're right...
aye, 'tis exactly the figure.

54:42.377 --> 54:49.300
Though the whole 632 might be
difficult to raise at the moment...

54:49.384 --> 54:54.305
prices have gone up since you've been
away... but with a sacrifice...

54:54.389 --> 54:59.310
I may manage, say, a hundred down
and the balance over... let me se...

54:59.394 --> 55:02.313
three months? Would that be acceptable?

55:02.397 --> 55:04.315
Blood-sucker!

55:05.400 --> 55:09.320
You're tremblin'.
Is it fever or fear?

55:09.404 --> 55:13.324
Neither one. I'm all a-tremble with
pleasure at seeing you restored to life.

55:13.408 --> 55:18.329
And your best affidavit to that would
be my 632 doubloons.

55:18.413 --> 55:20.331
See the course I lay?

55:20.415 --> 55:24.335
But! Great Heavens! What's this,
Captain? You're short of a leg!

55:24.419 --> 55:27.338
Oh, an active man like yourself...
what a tragedy!

55:27.422 --> 55:30.341
Belay that. Me doubloons!

55:32.427 --> 55:38.349
Hendrick, bring me over my casket, that
I may count out 622 doubloons for...

55:38.433 --> 55:41.352
632.

55:50.445 --> 55:54.365
- Now we can talk business.
- What business?

55:54.449 --> 55:56.367
You don't...

55:57.452 --> 56:01.372
You don't reckon. I'd come back
empty-handed, do you?

56:01.456 --> 56:05.376
- I've got me a galleon! -Gold!

56:05.460 --> 56:11.382
- Ah, no gold, not at all. 'Ostages!
- Not again! I've had a skilful of 'em...

56:11.466 --> 56:14.385
they're swarming like
maggots all over the island.

56:14.469 --> 56:19.390
I swear I'll never touch another
hostage. You keep 'em!

56:20.475 --> 56:23.394
There... six hundred...

56:25.480 --> 56:27.398
and thirty-two.

56:33.488 --> 56:35.406
Go fetch the Frog.

56:35.490 --> 56:38.409
- Is that one back as well?
- Tell 'im to bring the hostages.

56:38.493 --> 56:43.414
- No, no... no thank you, not here!
- Move, or you'll lose your ears!

56:47.460 --> 56:49.420
Harkee to this, Dutch...

56:50.463 --> 56:52.423
What?

56:54.467 --> 56:58.429
I've got... the niece of the
Governor of Maracaibo, and the...

56:58.471 --> 57:02.433
- First Lieutenant of the "Neptune"!
- First of third, who cares?

57:02.475 --> 57:06.437
For over 2 years now I've been trying to
ransom the best-known lawyer in Spain.

57:06.479 --> 57:11.442
Nobody wants him, his wife, his children,
the bar at Seville, not even for free!

57:11.484 --> 57:17.448
- Those halfwits did cut his tongue out.
- Of course... a lawyer without a tongue!

57:17.490 --> 57:21.452
No, Red, no. I mean it. What with the
traveling expenses, the go-betweens...

57:21.494 --> 57:25.456
the overheads... a hostage isn't
even worth his keep these days.

57:25.498 --> 57:31.462
Neptune, Neptune... Let me see now,
she was bound for Spain, was she not?

57:31.504 --> 57:34.465
- Aye...
- And you say there was no gold on board?

57:34.507 --> 57:39.470
Come in, come in, me beauties,
that I may present you to Dutch.

57:39.512 --> 57:44.475
- No, no! I don't want to see them!
- Look, here she is... niece to the...

57:44.517 --> 57:50.482
Governor of Maracaibo. He'll cough
up 3,000 at least. What's your name?

57:50.523 --> 57:54.486
Three thousand! Insolent scoundrel!
If you knew your business you'd know...

57:54.527 --> 57:57.489
- I'm worth ten times as much!
- Take them away! Get them out of here!

57:57.530 --> 58:00.492
Drown them if you've a mind too.
I want nothing to do with 'em.

58:00.533 --> 58:06.498
You son of a double-dyed whore from
the reeking gutters o' Rotterdam!

58:06.539 --> 58:11.503
A plague on your scurvy head...
what's wrong with me 'ostages?

58:11.544 --> 58:13.505
They're hostages...
that's enough!

58:15.548 --> 58:18.510
What's this here, then...
horse-apples?

58:18.551 --> 58:20.512
Right!

58:20.553 --> 58:25.517
- So how much for him... a hundred?
- Not even. Last July Carlos the...

58:25.558 --> 58:31.523
Portuguese negotiated an arch-bishop for
only 325. So a padre... you can imagine!

58:31.564 --> 58:36.528
You might dump him in Shark's Cove...
he's not worth the price of his sandals.

58:43.576 --> 58:48.540
We'll speak of it later. Our of your
juice, vulture! You're givin' a party!

59:01.594 --> 59:05.557
Aye, m'hearties, 'tis I.

59:06.599 --> 59:12.564
I've lost a drumstick, true,
but the rest's all Cap'n Red!

59:27.620 --> 59:33.585
I'm half-seas over with joy at seein'
your friendly physiognomies again.

59:34.627 --> 59:36.588
Diddler...

59:37.630 --> 59:42.594
still alive and kickin'?
You old skulk, you!

59:43.636 --> 59:47.599
Where's Meat-Hook!
Ah, there you be...

59:48.641 --> 59:51.603
sour-faced as ever.

59:52.645 --> 59:56.608
Bibleback! Not grown
much straighter, have you?

01:00:03.656 --> 01:00:09.621
So Moonhead... took me for Satan
himself out there, did you?

01:00:09.662 --> 01:00:12.624
Soiled your linen, did you?

01:00:16.669 --> 01:00:22.634
Strike me blind, you've as much to
say as a shoal o' mackerel!

01:00:22.675 --> 01:00:26.638
Look at me! Four years and more
on a poxy desert island...

01:00:26.679 --> 01:00:31.643
yet I can still crack a smile.
What ails you all?

01:00:31.684 --> 01:00:35.647
Had your tongues pruned like
that dago lawyer?

01:00:38.691 --> 01:00:42.654
That's better, me hearties.
Let's make the rafters ring!

01:00:42.695 --> 01:00:46.658
We'll drain the Dutchman's cellar...
drinks are on the house.

01:00:46.699 --> 01:00:49.661
Life's a bed o' roses!

01:01:04.717 --> 01:01:09.681
Dang me buttons! That were
worse'n a Spanish broadside!

01:01:11.724 --> 01:01:14.686
We thought you was killed
at Boca del Toro.

01:01:14.727 --> 01:01:18.690
Saint's blood, that's what I thought myself!

01:01:19.732 --> 01:01:23.695
So did the Spaniards likewise...
else we'd not be here now.

01:01:23.736 --> 01:01:27.699
Shan't forget Boca del Toro for quite
a while. Never did more killing...

01:01:27.740 --> 01:01:30.702
- in all my life... Did I, Frog?
- Never Cap'n.

01:01:30.743 --> 01:01:34.706
Why, you should've seen old Froggie
here, screamin' "Vive la France!"

01:01:34.747 --> 01:01:37.709
And layin' about him like a demon.

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:42.714
That was your day, son, was it not?
Well, 'tweren't mine. Damnation...

01:01:42.755 --> 01:01:45.717
cannon ball tore one leg to shreds.

01:01:45.758 --> 01:01:49.721
Hey, Scratch! That rum...
do we get it today or tomorrow?

01:01:49.762 --> 01:01:54.726
Directly, Captain, directly. Moonhead,
surprise, fetch up another keg.

01:01:54.767 --> 01:01:58.730
- I wan' hear 'Ap'n Red!
- Do as you're told, wretch!

01:01:58.771 --> 01:02:01.733
All that remained
of the Black Princess -

01:02:01.774 --> 01:02:05.737
a few spars and suchlike... broke up on
the reefs of that accursed island.

01:02:05.778 --> 01:02:10.742
Four and a half years' scrimplin'
on turtle-meat and coconuts...

01:02:11.784 --> 01:02:17.749
Aye, purgatory it was...
not like the good ship "Neptune"...

01:02:17.790 --> 01:02:22.754
where these generous Spanish
officers received us like princes.

01:02:22.795 --> 01:02:26.758
Come, come! Join our little party!
Now's your chance... you've earned it.

01:02:26.799 --> 01:02:30.762
Shift yer arses!
Make room for the gen'le folk!

01:02:30.803 --> 01:02:34.766
Free our guests' flippers,
that they may drink me health!

01:02:34.808 --> 01:02:41.773
'Avin' been so 'andsomely received
at your table, sir...

01:02:41.815 --> 01:02:46.778
I 'ope I may prevail upon you
to accept me 'ospitality.

01:02:46.820 --> 01:02:51.783
An officer of the Royal Fleet
does not drink with pirates.

01:02:53.827 --> 01:02:57.789
It takes all kinds to make a world,
does it not, Padre?

01:02:57.831 --> 01:03:00.792
It does indeed, my son,
it does indeed.

01:03:00.834 --> 01:03:03.795
As we hear from Dutch,
an expert in these matters...

01:03:03.837 --> 01:03:06.798
you're not worth a bag o' nails.

01:03:06.840 --> 01:03:11.803
So, pirate that I am, I find myself
obliged to have your hanged from...

01:03:11.845 --> 01:03:15.807
the yardarm of your beloved "Neptune".
You'll be dancin' a jig on air...

01:03:15.849 --> 01:03:19.811
- come day-break. What say you to that?
- Death means less to me than...

01:03:19.853 --> 01:03:24.816
dishonor! Had you the courage,
you would confront me sword in hand.

01:03:26.860 --> 01:03:31.823
You will not deign to drink with us,
yet you would taste our steel.

01:03:31.865 --> 01:03:35.827
Well, I have it in mind to play a
little game we never tire of...

01:03:35.869 --> 01:03:40.832
me mates and I, which I myself
call Dead Man's Nag.

01:03:47.881 --> 01:03:50.842
Legs a thoroughbred!

01:03:50.884 --> 01:03:53.845
To the death, gentlemen.

01:03:59.893 --> 01:04:03.855
And if any rider's feet touch
the ground before he's skewered...

01:04:03.897 --> 01:04:08.860
I'll have you hanged... prompt,
riders and nags alike.

01:04:27.921 --> 01:04:31.883
Do not be distressed, mam'selle,
'tis only a sport.

01:04:42.936 --> 01:04:45.897
There, that's better! I like that!

01:04:45.939 --> 01:04:50.902
The winner's life shall be spared.
Cap'n Red gives his word on it.

01:05:02.956 --> 01:05:07.919
Tell me, I was just wondering,
the throne or Kapatek-Anahuac...

01:05:07.961 --> 01:05:09.921
- Who?
- Kapatek-Anahuac...

01:05:09.963 --> 01:05:12.924
- Never 'eard of 'im.
- Well, I gather...

01:05:12.966 --> 01:05:17.929
I thought the "Neptune"...

01:05:18.972 --> 01:05:21.933
- I heard a rumor that...
- What rumor?

01:05:21.975 --> 01:05:25.937
Nothing... Just idle gossip.

01:05:26.980 --> 01:05:28.940
Nothing.

01:05:35.989 --> 01:05:39.951
You've been blabbin' about
me throne, you dog!

01:05:39.993 --> 01:05:43.955
No, not a word, Captain, not a word!

01:05:43.997 --> 01:05:47.959
Mum as a clam, I swear!

01:05:59.012 --> 01:06:08.980
Get up! Get up, get up!
Get up, get up. Yah, uh...

01:06:24.037 --> 01:06:29.000
Damn it! Get up! Get up!

01:07:57.130 --> 01:07:59.090
And who might you be, sir?

01:08:00.133 --> 01:08:03.094
It must be that lawyer
the Dutchman spoke of.

01:08:03.136 --> 01:08:06.097
Is it you, sir, whose tongue
these dogs have cut out?

01:08:06.139 --> 01:08:11.102
Heaven be praised! Can you assist us?
Do you have a plan?

01:08:15.148 --> 01:08:18.109
- What does he mean?
- He appears to be to be thirsty.

01:08:18.151 --> 01:08:20.111
Thristy? Ridiculous!
What is that to us?

01:08:20.153 --> 01:08:22.113
He wants some rum.

01:08:22.154 --> 01:08:27.118
In the name of His Majesty, I command
you to help us... we need arms.

01:08:28.161 --> 01:08:30.121
Give him some rum!

01:08:31.163 --> 01:08:36.127
What! Three more barrels? Over
my dead body... you tell him that.

01:08:36.169 --> 01:08:39.130
I'd rather you told him yourself.

01:09:15.207 --> 01:09:21.171
"Three barrels of rum are to be taken
aboard the "Neptune".

01:09:21.214 --> 01:09:24.175
May God help you."

01:09:48.241 --> 01:09:51.202
- Good fortune!
- All our hopes go with you, my son.

01:09:51.243 --> 01:09:54.205
Quite so, quite so.
Give us a blessing.

01:10:01.254 --> 01:10:04.215
Quick, quick!

01:10:10.263 --> 01:10:12.223
Where are those barrels?

01:10:20.273 --> 01:10:22.233
Come!

01:10:22.275 --> 01:10:28.239
Come on, mates, that's it! I took
bets on who could drink fastest.

01:10:28.281 --> 01:10:31.242
You mean the most!
Who cares how long it takes?

01:11:20.333 --> 01:11:25.296
I was thinking: if we were to keep
one of these three barrels...

01:11:25.338 --> 01:11:30.301
- would there not still be two left?
- What do you say?

01:11:30.343 --> 01:11:33.304
- Keep it how?
- Roll it over the side.

01:11:33.346 --> 01:11:37.308
- It would sink.
- Nay, it'll float...

01:11:37.350 --> 01:11:41.312
we can moor it to the anchor
and pick it up later.

01:11:41.354 --> 01:11:43.314
Now!

01:11:43.356 --> 01:11:46.317
No, later!

01:12:38.411 --> 01:12:40.371
Long live the King!

01:12:40.413 --> 01:12:45.376
Thanks be to God, who in his infinite
wisdom has put an end to this mutiny.

01:12:45.418 --> 01:12:49.380
The buccaneer is dead.
So is his crony.

01:12:50.423 --> 01:12:55.386
Here's a man of mettle...
one who put loyalty before treason.

01:12:55.428 --> 01:12:58.389
He suffered terribly in the fray,
poor soul...

01:12:58.431 --> 01:13:04.395
but his valor shall not go unrewarded.
How say you, Gonzalez?

01:13:05.438 --> 01:13:09.400
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

01:13:09.442 --> 01:13:11.402
Long live the King!

01:13:12.445 --> 01:13:17.408
- Long live the King!
- Long live the King!

01:13:17.450 --> 01:13:24.415
<i>A roving, a roving
Since roving's been my ruin I aim</i>

01:13:24.457 --> 01:13:31.422
<i>We'll go no more a roving
With you fair maid</i>

01:13:31.464 --> 01:13:35.426
- Why do you always stare at me?
- Captain Red commanded me...

01:13:35.468 --> 01:13:39.430
- not to take my eyes off you.
- You are very obedient.

01:13:39.472 --> 01:13:41.432
I do my duty.

01:13:41.474 --> 01:13:45.436
Is he perhaps frightened that
I shall grow wings and fly away?

01:13:45.478 --> 01:13:48.439
- Perhaps.
- And you, sir?

01:13:49.482 --> 01:13:55.446
- I, mam'selle?
- Why did you come to my rescue?

01:13:56.489 --> 01:13:59.450
Why did you kill one of your
comrades for my sake?

01:13:59.492 --> 01:14:03.454
Ahoy there, sonny!
Come over here by us!

01:14:03.496 --> 01:14:07.458
Or take her into the bushes!

01:14:11.504 --> 01:14:16.467
Ah! Very good morning to you,
Master Carpenter.

01:14:16.509 --> 01:14:21.473
I was just a'wonderin' if
you had any further need o' me ring?

01:14:21.514 --> 01:14:25.477
Since I've been parted from it, 'tis
as though I were missin' a finger.

01:14:25.518 --> 01:14:27.479
Here it is.

01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:29.481
As good as new.

01:14:31.524 --> 01:14:33.485
To arms!

01:14:34.527 --> 01:14:36.488
To arms!

01:14:39.532 --> 01:14:41.493
To arms!

01:14:52.545 --> 01:14:55.507
On your feet swine!
On your feet!

01:14:55.548 --> 01:14:58.510
On your feet...!

01:15:04.557 --> 01:15:06.518
Up, up...

01:15:08.561 --> 01:15:11.523
You too, get up...
Get up.

01:15:57.610 --> 01:16:02.574
Me throne. Me throne!!!

01:16:07.620 --> 01:16:11.583
Here, you cut-throats...
you forgot your trademark!

01:16:12.625 --> 01:16:15.587
Better luck in the next world!

01:16:35.648 --> 01:16:39.611
- What will they do with us?
- Rest easy, my pigeon.

01:16:39.652 --> 01:16:43.615
I saw you born and I shall see you
married. Your safety is precious...

01:16:43.656 --> 01:16:49.621
- to these cut-throats.
- Yet they are not all wicked men.

01:16:49.662 --> 01:16:52.624
That Frenchman, for instance...

01:16:54.667 --> 01:16:56.628
He seems different...

01:17:06.679 --> 01:17:10.642
Anaconda Bay... that's
where we'll hide.

01:17:47.720 --> 01:17:49.681
All quiet topside?

01:17:49.722 --> 01:17:57.689
Aye, sir. All shipshape and seaworthy.
Tide'll be up by eight bells.

01:18:28.761 --> 01:18:31.723
Who goes there? Password!

01:18:32.765 --> 01:18:36.728
'Tis, Maria Dolores Eugenia del Alcade.

01:18:41.774 --> 01:18:43.735
Señorita!

01:18:44.777 --> 01:18:49.741
This Padre and his brave companions have
delivered me from the pirates' clutches.

01:18:49.782 --> 01:18:54.746
- Conduct me to my uncle.
- At once, Señorita...

01:18:54.787 --> 01:18:57.749
- I will call the Officer of the Watch.
- My son...

01:19:00.793 --> 01:19:05.757
I have a communication of paramount
importance to impart to His Excellency.

01:19:05.798 --> 01:19:09.761
Kindly convey us thither
with the utmost discretion.

01:19:09.803 --> 01:19:13.765
No one else may know of me presence 'ere...

01:19:13.807 --> 01:19:16.768
so batten down yer 'atches!

01:19:17.811 --> 01:19:23.775
- Well? Did you hear what the Padre said?
- Directly, Señorita!

01:19:36.830 --> 01:19:40.792
Your uncle will rejoice to see you safe and sound.

01:19:45.839 --> 01:19:48.800
We have all been praying
for you, Señorita.

01:20:10.864 --> 01:20:12.824
Hell's bells!

01:20:48.902 --> 01:20:53.865
Permit me to rouse my poor uncle,
else he may die of apoplexy.

01:21:03.917 --> 01:21:05.877
Uncle Archibaldo!

01:21:12.926 --> 01:21:14.886
'Tis I, Dolores!

01:21:15.929 --> 01:21:17.889
Wake up...

01:21:17.931 --> 01:21:20.892
wake up, I bessech you!

01:21:21.935 --> 01:21:26.898
- Uncle Archibaldo!
- That'll do! On yer feet, Archie!

01:21:32.946 --> 01:21:39.911
Oh forgive me, Lord! San Antonio
deliver me from all these demons!

01:21:39.953 --> 01:21:41.913
'Tis Dolores, your niece!

01:21:45.959 --> 01:21:48.920
Eh! Are we all dead?

01:21:49.963 --> 01:21:52.924
- Where am I, Father?
- I'm not your father, idiot!

01:21:52.966 --> 01:21:54.926
I'm Cap'n Red!

01:21:59.973 --> 01:22:02.934
- Thomas Bartholomew Red!
- Himself...

01:22:02.976 --> 01:22:06.938
but pressed for time. Now bend your ear to
this: I've got your niece here...

01:22:06.980 --> 01:22:09.941
and I'll trade her for
the throne of Kapatek-Anahuac.

01:22:09.983 --> 01:22:13.945
What insolence! That throne
belongs to the Spanish Crown!

01:22:13.987 --> 01:22:16.948
No longer, you old whale!
I want it! At once!

01:22:16.990 --> 01:22:19.951
Never! Do you understand?

01:22:20.994 --> 01:22:22.954
Never!

01:22:25.999 --> 01:22:27.959
- Go on, sonny!
- Where, Cap'n?

01:22:28.001 --> 01:22:29.961
Rape!

01:22:36.009 --> 01:22:39.971
- What are you waiting for?
- I... I can't.

01:22:40.013 --> 01:22:42.974
- 'Tis an order!
- I know Cap'n...

01:22:43.016 --> 01:22:45.977
- yet... no!
- Insubordination!

01:22:46.019 --> 01:22:50.982
- Boomako, stand in for this traitor!
- Aye, Cap'n.

01:22:51.024 --> 01:22:57.989
No, no, save me, sir, for
pity's sake listen to your heart!

01:22:58.031 --> 01:23:00.992
Surely, my virtue is worth a throne?

01:23:01.034 --> 01:23:03.995
- You agree then?
- Never!

01:23:04.037 --> 01:23:07.999
You shall see what stuff a
Spanish Governor is made of!

01:23:09.042 --> 01:23:14.005
Monster! At least have the grace
to kill me before you dishonor me!

01:23:14.047 --> 01:23:17.008
Cap'n, can't you see? He doesn't
care two coppers for his niece!

01:23:17.050 --> 01:23:19.010
- Let's have his eye out!
- No!

01:23:19.052 --> 01:23:24.015
Aye, there's a pretty notion!
Let's take a peek at 'is brains!

01:23:24.057 --> 01:23:29.020
Spare him, I beg you! I will give you
my jewels... all my jewels!

01:23:29.062 --> 01:23:33.024
Have pity on him. I implore you,
for the sake of the mother that...

01:23:33.066 --> 01:23:35.026
bore you in her womb!

01:23:36.069 --> 01:23:42.033
Oh, my gout! My gout!
Get off, quick! You're killing me!

01:23:45.078 --> 01:23:52.043
Help! Hel..." Stop! Stop! Stop! In
the name of the Holy Virgin, stop!

01:23:52.085 --> 01:23:55.046
- The throne!
- Give him his throne! Go fetch it...

01:23:55.088 --> 01:23:59.050
Captain, go, but don't touch
my foot again.

01:23:59.092 --> 01:24:02.053
By the Holy Eternal,
don't touch my foot!

01:24:02.095 --> 01:24:04.055
Out of yer crib!

01:24:05.098 --> 01:24:10.061
Now be a good lad and do
as you're told. Else...

01:24:11.104 --> 01:24:13.064
Take your pen!

01:24:15.108 --> 01:24:17.068
Here, set this down...

01:24:33.126 --> 01:24:36.087
- "I Archibaldo..."
- I...

01:24:36.129 --> 01:24:43.094
- Eh, what's your name?
- Archibaldo Estéban del Acalde.

01:24:43.136 --> 01:24:49.100
"I Archibaldo... yes, yes, and the rest of it...
Governor of Maracaibo..."

01:24:50.143 --> 01:24:55.106
- Knight of the Holy Sepulchre...
- Stow that! Write: "...of Maracaibo...

01:24:55.148 --> 01:25:02.113
do hereby discharge First Lieutenant
Don Alfonso de la Torre...

01:25:02.155 --> 01:25:06.117
of all responsibility for me throne..."

01:25:07.160 --> 01:25:16.127
No, no, no, for the conveyance of the
throne of Kapatek-Anahuac to Spain."

01:25:29.182 --> 01:25:31.142
Enter!

01:25:36.189 --> 01:25:38.149
Your Excellency!

01:25:40.193 --> 01:25:43.154
- My respects, señora.
- Lieutenant, we are in a grave...

01:25:43.196 --> 01:25:46.157
predicament! The pirates
attack at dawn!

01:25:46.199 --> 01:25:49.160
Let them come! We shall be ready for them!

01:25:49.202 --> 01:25:54.165
Calm yourself! This blackmore contrived
to escape from their lair...

01:25:54.207 --> 01:25:58.169
he knows their plans.
Speak up, my good man.

01:25:58.211 --> 01:26:02.173
- It, 'tis I, Lieutenant... 'tis Boomako!
- What!

01:26:03.216 --> 01:26:07.178
That black dog here?
That renegade?

01:26:08.221 --> 01:26:10.181
I'll settle his score here and now!

01:26:10.223 --> 01:26:14.185
- Governor, Governor! Protect me!
- You shall die, mutineer!

01:26:14.227 --> 01:26:18.189
- I grant him pardon!
- His rightful place is on the scaffold...

01:26:18.231 --> 01:26:22.193
- garroted with the rest of them.
- Don Alfonso! Kindly bear in mind that...

01:26:22.235 --> 01:26:28.199
I alone am responsible for the
administration of justice.

01:26:28.241 --> 01:26:32.203
As you say, Excellency. But this
reptile sough to poison...

01:26:32.245 --> 01:26:35.206
- Captain Avila de Linares!
- Not true!

01:26:35.248 --> 01:26:38.209
- I loved the Captain like my own mother!
- Shut your mouth, murderer!

01:26:38.251 --> 01:26:40.211
Restrain yourself, Lieutenant.

01:26:40.253 --> 01:26:43.214
You are addressing a pardoned man.

01:26:43.256 --> 01:26:48.219
He's the one! He jealous!
He poison our good Captain!

01:26:48.261 --> 01:26:50.221
It's possible.

01:26:50.263 --> 01:26:52.223
Your pardon, Excellency?

01:26:57.270 --> 01:26:59.230
I cannot hear you.

01:27:00.273 --> 01:27:06.237
Was saying that this cursed gout makes
me suffer the tortures of the damned!

01:27:06.279 --> 01:27:11.242
A plague upon it!
But enough of my afflictions.

01:27:11.284 --> 01:27:15.246
Time is against us, Don Alfonso.
Captain Red...

01:27:15.288 --> 01:27:21.252
that filthy ayeee... I mean,
that noted gentlemen of fortune...

01:27:21.294 --> 01:27:25.256
intends to board the "Neptune",
at dawn and take delivery of his...

01:27:25.298 --> 01:27:30.261
That is, steal the throne
of Kapatek-Anahuac.

01:27:30.303 --> 01:27:34.265
- I'll make mincemeat of him!
- In the meantime, I have resolved...

01:27:34.307 --> 01:27:39.270
as follows: the throne will be
taken into safekeeping...

01:27:39.312 --> 01:27:45.276
by two secret envoys of mine. They
will come bearing a letter which...

01:27:45.318 --> 01:27:50.281
will absolve you of all further
responsibility. That is all.

01:27:51.324 --> 01:27:56.287
- You may withdraw.
- Very good, sir.

01:27:58.331 --> 01:28:00.291
And the password?

01:28:00.333 --> 01:28:04.295
Password? Er, oh, let me see...

01:28:07.340 --> 01:28:13.304
- Gout is gold".
- old is gold.

01:28:13.346 --> 01:28:16.307
So be it, Excellency.

01:28:24.357 --> 01:28:27.318
- Not too tight?
- Nay, sir.

01:28:27.360 --> 01:28:29.320
- My apologies.
- Can you count?

01:28:29.362 --> 01:28:32.323
- Count what, Captain?
- Count: one, two, three, four...

01:28:32.365 --> 01:28:35.326
- Five, six, seven, eight, nine...
- That'll do, that'll do... perfect.

01:28:35.368 --> 01:28:39.330
- You're to count to ten thousand.
- One, two, three...

01:28:39.372 --> 01:28:43.334
Not yet... as soon as we leave.
When you reach ten thousand...

01:28:43.376 --> 01:28:47.338
you're to join us aboard the brig
at Anaconda Bay. Understand?

01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:49.340
- Aye, aye, Captain.
- Here!

01:28:50.383 --> 01:28:55.346
No one us to leave this room alive
before ten thousand. Not even you.

01:28:55.388 --> 01:28:57.348
Not even me, Captain.

01:29:00.393 --> 01:29:05.356
Wish I 'ad more trumps like you
under me command!

01:29:19.412 --> 01:29:21.372
Who goes there?

01:29:22.415 --> 01:29:25.376
Gout is gold.

01:29:52.445 --> 01:29:54.405
An order is an order...

01:29:55.448 --> 01:29:59.410
- so be it. Lower away!
- Lower away!

01:30:02.455 --> 01:30:06.417
Triple the guard!
All hands to remains at their posts!

01:30:06.459 --> 01:30:08.419
Aye, ayes, sir.

01:31:48.478 --> 01:31:52.941
3993. 3994.

01:31:53.107 --> 01:32:02.033
3995. 3996.
3997. 3398.

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:13.044
3999. 4000. 4001.
4002. 4003. 4004.

01:33:19.652 --> 01:33:21.613
Stroke.

01:33:22.655 --> 01:33:24.616
Stroke.

01:33:24.657 --> 01:33:26.618
Stroke.

01:33:26.659 --> 01:33:28.620
Stroke.

01:33:29.662 --> 01:33:31.623
Stroke.

01:33:31.664 --> 01:33:33.625
Stroke.

01:33:33.666 --> 01:33:35.627
Stroke.

01:33:36.669 --> 01:33:38.630
Stroke.

01:33:38.671 --> 01:33:40.632
Hold!

01:34:09.702 --> 01:34:15.667
Oh, O Lord, get Boomako out of this!
Don't let him sink!

01:35:19.772 --> 01:35:24.736
Man ahoy! Down on the beach!

01:35:40.794 --> 01:35:47.759
Right now, here you are, Señorita.
And now, since, since my, my neck...

01:35:47.801 --> 01:35:53.765
is at stake and I have eleven mouths
to fe... feed.

01:35:56.810 --> 01:36:00.772
And this? It is my bounden duty
to search all...

01:36:13.827 --> 01:36:21.793
Rum? Oh no, no, I could never
turn a blind eye to that!

01:36:52.866 --> 01:36:57.829
I come to bid you farewell.
And to thank you...

01:36:57.871 --> 01:36:59.831
Farewell?

01:36:59.873 --> 01:37:01.833
Fate wished us enemies...

01:37:01.875 --> 01:37:04.836
yet you have twice saved my honor.

01:37:04.878 --> 01:37:08.840
- You are leaving?
- This every evening I sail for Spain.

01:37:08.882 --> 01:37:11.843
- Pardieu! This evening!
- And...

01:37:12.886 --> 01:37:15.847
- And?
- My uncle has...

01:37:16.890 --> 01:37:20.852
Don Alfonso has been promoted
Captain of the "Neptune".

01:37:22.896 --> 01:37:25.857
- I'm so unhappy Monsieur Malfilâtre.
- Call me Jean-Baptiste.

01:37:25.899 --> 01:37:31.863
There is more: my uncle has
betrothed me to Don Alfonso!

01:37:32.906 --> 01:37:36.868
- Against my will!
- What do you have in your little basket?

01:37:58.932 --> 01:38:03.895
My little angel!
God bless your kindly heart!

01:38:03.937 --> 01:38:09.901
I, I have not yet told you
the worst tidings at all.

01:38:11.945 --> 01:38:16.908
Tomorrow, at dawn...

01:38:16.950 --> 01:38:22.914
- You are both to be... garroted.
- What about the throne?

01:38:22.956 --> 01:38:27.919
Captain... You are to be...
Tomorrow, at dawn...

01:38:27.961 --> 01:38:31.923
- I 'eard yer, but where's the throne?
- We don't give a damn for your throne!

01:38:31.965 --> 01:38:34.926
He don't truly mean it...
he's just shook up.

01:38:35.969 --> 01:38:37.929
The throne is back on the "Neptune".

01:38:46.980 --> 01:38:53.945
Captain, the Lord teaches us
forgiveness. I shall pray for your soul.

01:38:54.988 --> 01:38:57.949
Farewell, Jean-Baptiste.

01:39:04.998 --> 01:39:06.958
Hell's bells!

01:39:10.003 --> 01:39:11.963
Blasted chain!

01:40:01.054 --> 01:40:06.017
No sweeter voice could complement a
sunset of such breath-taking splendor.

01:40:06.059 --> 01:40:08.019
Thank you, Captain.

01:40:08.061 --> 01:40:12.023
To be Master of as fine a vessel as this
would gladden the heart of any man alive.

01:40:12.065 --> 01:40:17.028
- I am sure of it.
- Yet for me 'tis not enough.

01:40:18.071 --> 01:40:23.034
I mean to wait until such time as you
may deign to appreciate my qualifies...

01:40:23.076 --> 01:40:28.039
and so... may come to love me.

01:40:28.081 --> 01:40:32.043
- Goodnight, Dolores.
- Goodnight, sir.

01:41:07.120 --> 01:41:09.080
Go on, dance!

01:41:10.123 --> 01:41:12.083
Dance, dance!

01:41:40.153 --> 01:41:42.113
Fire at will!

01:41:46.159 --> 01:41:48.119
Don't shoot!

01:41:48.161 --> 01:41:51.122
Don't shoot! We're Christians!

01:41:52.165 --> 01:41:56.127
By all that's holy, cease fire!

01:41:56.169 --> 01:42:02.133
'Tis Friar Don Antonio Fuentes
of the Dominican Order!

01:42:58.231 --> 01:43:00.191
Madre de Dio... Aah!

01:43:16.249 --> 01:43:21.212
- There, there... where my finger is!
- That little speck?

01:43:21.254 --> 01:43:24.215
Yes, my lad. That little speck is a brig.

01:43:24.257 --> 01:43:27.218
I hope 'tis not a pirate, Captain.

01:43:28.261 --> 01:43:32.223
Have no fear of pirates, señora.
They would receive a warm welcome...

01:43:32.265 --> 01:43:38.229
the "Neptune" carries 70 cannon. She's
the fastest galleon in the Royal Fleet.

01:43:38.271 --> 01:43:42.233
- The fastest?
- Yes, sir. Take that craft there.

01:43:43.276 --> 01:43:47.238
A brig... every stitch of
canvas out, yet...

01:43:47.280 --> 01:43:50.241
she hasn't gained a cable's
length on us since dawn.

01:43:50.283 --> 01:43:55.246
- Why should she follow us?
- She is not following us...

01:43:55.288 --> 01:43:58.249
she is merely sailing
in the same direction.

01:44:49.342 --> 01:44:51.302
Now!

01:45:22.375 --> 01:45:26.337
That's just to put some fire
in your bellies!

01:45:27.380 --> 01:45:32.343
No goin' back now.
'Tis victory or death!

01:45:46.399 --> 01:45:49.360
To board!

01:45:58.411 --> 01:46:04.375
Into the longboat with you! Take
some vittles! Secret mission!

01:47:41.514 --> 01:47:43.475
Come, girl.

01:49:09.602 --> 01:49:12.564
Come on, put your backs in it.

01:49:14.607 --> 01:49:18.570
That's it, lower... What do you want
to do? Have some music?

01:50:03.656 --> 01:50:05.617
Oh my God!

01:50:05.658 --> 01:50:11.623
Stop you sobbing stupid woman!
Over the side!

01:50:21.674 --> 01:50:23.635
Dolores!

01:51:12.725 --> 01:51:15.687
Boomako... Boomako!

01:51:16.729 --> 01:51:20.692
No, not up, down...

01:51:32.745 --> 01:51:34.706
Help!

01:51:43.756 --> 01:51:46.718
Over here... Frog...

01:51:49.762 --> 01:51:53.725
Frog...!

01:52:04.777 --> 01:52:06.738
Thanks you alive.

01:52:21.795 --> 01:52:23.755
Hey!...

01:52:27.801 --> 01:52:29.761
Hey!...

01:52:54.828 --> 01:52:57.789
The rope, Frog, the rope!
Quick! Cut it!

01:52:57.831 --> 01:52:59.791
Merde!

01:52:59.833 --> 01:53:05.797
'Tis an order! You signed articles!
Cut it or I'll have you hanged!

01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:08.800
Hold on!

01:53:10.844 --> 01:53:13.805
Wait! Wait!

01:53:16.850 --> 01:53:17.809
Right.

01:53:22.856 --> 01:53:27.819
Wait, wait, you lily-livered
scoundrel! Come back and fight...

01:53:27.861 --> 01:53:30.822
like a man! Canaille... Fripouille...

01:53:31.865 --> 01:53:33.825
Cornegidouille...!

01:53:35.869 --> 01:53:40.832
Alfonso, you scum! I'll hunt you down...
I'll skin you alive!

01:53:40.874 --> 01:53:44.836
e's an end to you once and for all, you slimy French

01:53:44.878 --> 01:53:46.838
Jean-Baptiste!

01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:51.843
Aah, Captain! Boomako is dead!

01:54:18.912 --> 01:54:22.874
Come back! Come back!

01:54:22.916 --> 01:54:25.877
May you rot in hell!

01:54:51.945 --> 01:54:54.906
Hey, Frog... What o'clock is it?

01:54:56.950 --> 01:55:01.913
- Six or eight...
- Good.

01:55:02.956 --> 01:55:06.918
Give us an 'am and
a bottle of Malaga.

01:55:19.973 --> 01:55:23.935
Don't pull that face, damn you!

01:55:23.977 --> 01:55:26.938
Drink! Eat!

01:55:28.982 --> 01:55:31.943
We're alive, aren't we?

01:55:41.995 --> 01:55:44.956
- And Frog?
- Yes, Cap'n.

01:55:44.998 --> 01:55:48.960
Would you do me a kindness?
Sing a little, while I nod off...

01:55:49.002 --> 01:55:52.964
and mind you sing,
don't bray like a donkey.

01:55:54.007 --> 01:55:56.968
Sing that little French ditty
I've a liking for.

01:56:03.016 --> 01:56:12.984
<i>Il était un petit navire
Il était un petit navire</i>

01:56:13.026 --> 01:56:20.992
<i>Dessus la mer, la malon lonère
Dessus la mer s'en est allé</i>

01:56:21.034 --> 01:56:32.003
<i>Pour achever le tour du monde
Pour achever le tour du monde</i>

01:56:32.045 --> 01:56:41.012
<i>Sans jamais la malon lon la
San jamais la terre aborder</i>
