00:00.058 --> 00:01.343
<i>Previously on</i> Genius...

00:01.343 --> 00:04.236
I need help,
someone to work alongside me.

00:04.237 --> 00:06.407
Do you have someone particular in mind?

00:06.408 --> 00:09.218
Time is not absolute.

00:09.219 --> 00:11.965
(Besso gasps, Einstein laughs)

00:11.966 --> 00:13.371
Holy hell.

00:13.372 --> 00:16.084
I've devised my own
principle of relativity.

00:16.085 --> 00:18.544
It's the redefinition of the universe.

00:18.545 --> 00:20.460
This is what we've been chasing.

00:20.461 --> 00:21.481
You thanked Michele.

00:21.482 --> 00:22.472
EINSTEIN: Of course I thanked him.

00:22.473 --> 00:23.429
But I've helped you

00:23.430 --> 00:24.739
with so many papers,

00:24.740 --> 00:26.943
but you never thought to put
my name in any of them.

00:26.944 --> 00:28.284
It never occurred to me.

00:28.285 --> 00:29.242
Dr. Curie.

00:29.243 --> 00:30.361
You are to be awarded

00:30.362 --> 00:33.171
the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics.

00:33.172 --> 00:35.086
Please inform the Nobel committee

00:35.087 --> 00:36.652
<i>that I will not accept the prize</i>

00:36.653 --> 00:37.929
<i>if they do not honor
my wife alongside me.</i>

00:37.930 --> 00:39.046
This patent clerk in Bern.

00:39.047 --> 00:40.963
He has cited us both in his paper on...

00:40.964 --> 00:43.262
Light quanta, yes, indeed. You see?

00:43.263 --> 00:44.315
Einstein.

00:44.316 --> 00:45.976
It's fascinating what one can deduce

00:45.977 --> 00:47.814
about a man just by knowing his name.

00:47.815 --> 00:50.305
LAUE: <i>I'm here at the behest
of Professor Max Planck.</i>

00:50.306 --> 00:51.423
The father of Prussian physics?

00:51.424 --> 00:53.099
Tell me, are you working
on anything else?

00:53.100 --> 00:53.757
Yes.

00:53.758 --> 00:56.890
LAUE: Herr Einstein, it's... genius.

May I come in?

01:52.581 --> 01:55.838
My name is Dr. Carl Jung.

01:55.839 --> 01:57.888
I'm a friend of your father's.

02:14.043 --> 02:17.912
Can you tell me why you wanted
to hurt yourself, Eduard?

Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

02:23.815 --> 02:26.114
Don't cry, little one.

02:26.115 --> 02:29.052
When I come home, I'll
play you some Mozart.

02:29.053 --> 02:31.287
Maybe someday you'll be
a beautiful violinist

02:31.288 --> 02:32.310
like your papa.

02:32.311 --> 02:33.747
Practice your piano, Albertli.

02:33.748 --> 02:35.216
Later we'll play that nice minuet

02:35.217 --> 02:36.909
you've been learning for baby Eduard.

02:36.910 --> 02:38.537
(Eduard coughs)
He doesn't sound good at all.

02:38.538 --> 02:40.166
I can stay if you need me, Miza.

02:40.167 --> 02:41.538
We'll be all right.

02:41.539 --> 02:44.221
You're just nervous about your lecture.

02:44.222 --> 02:46.488
I suppose I can't be any more boring

02:46.489 --> 02:48.373
than fat, old Professor Pernet.

02:48.374 --> 02:49.747
You'll do fine, Albert.

02:49.748 --> 02:53.329
You've waited a long time
for this professorship.

02:55.815 --> 02:57.833

02:59.137 --> 03:00.676

(clears throat)

03:12.103 --> 03:13.508
Uh, so...

03:13.509 --> 03:14.721
good-good morning.

03:14.722 --> 03:16.675
Uh, I think...

03:17.595 --> 03:19.831
Uh, yes, yes.

03:19.832 --> 03:24.876
Newton's, uh, second law,
uh, acceleration

03:24.877 --> 03:28.619
in response to any force is, um...

03:33.181 --> 03:34.904
Actually, let's-let's start

03:34.905 --> 03:37.587
with his, uh, principle of-of gravity.

03:37.588 --> 03:39.956
Um...

03:42.986 --> 03:48.030
A-A force directly proportional
to the product of two masses

03:48.031 --> 03:51.831
and inversely proportional...

03:51.832 --> 03:53.530
(door closes)

03:56.781 --> 03:59.527
You all seem a bit restless.

03:59.528 --> 04:01.865
Who'd like to join me for a walk?

04:06.204 --> 04:07.799
MAN: <i>Why are we walking,
Herr Professor?</i>

04:07.800 --> 04:10.993
Because I'm a terrible lecturer,

04:10.994 --> 04:13.514
but I'm not a bad talker.

04:13.515 --> 04:14.985
You must have questions.

04:14.986 --> 04:18.656
Physics tries to explain
the entire universe.

04:18.658 --> 04:21.819
Who doesn't have questions about that?

04:21.820 --> 04:23.128
Look at the sky.

04:23.129 --> 04:25.300
Who can tell me why it's blue?

04:25.301 --> 04:27.152
Something to do with
scattering of light?

04:27.153 --> 04:29.228
That's what the books tell you.

04:29.229 --> 04:31.399
But what makes the light scatter?

04:31.400 --> 04:34.498
Believe it or not, nobody knows.

04:34.499 --> 04:37.947
Maybe we can work it out together.

04:37.948 --> 04:39.671
<i>(Eduard coughing)</i>

04:39.672 --> 04:40.853
It's not consumption, is it?

04:40.854 --> 04:42.098
He'll be fine.

04:42.099 --> 04:44.462
- Just a slight croup.
- Are you sure?

04:44.463 --> 04:46.538
I can't lose another child.
I-I couldn't bear it.

04:46.539 --> 04:49.480
Frankly, I'm more concerned
about your hysteria

04:49.481 --> 04:51.530
than the child's cough.

04:52.611 --> 04:55.803
I'm not hysterical. I'm tired.

04:55.804 --> 04:57.759
Your emotional reactions
are disproportionate.

04:57.760 --> 04:58.916
Do you think it's easy

04:58.917 --> 05:01.502
looking after two
children and a husband?

05:01.503 --> 05:02.253
May I ask,

05:02.254 --> 05:04.730
are you having relations
with your husband?

05:04.731 --> 05:06.101
Excuse me?

05:06.102 --> 05:07.283
It is a medical fact:

05:07.284 --> 05:10.125
a woman's organs do
not function properly

05:10.126 --> 05:12.335
if she's not meeting
her husband's needs.

05:14.725 --> 05:16.328
(Eduard cries)

05:17.361 --> 05:20.679
EINSTEIN: And so Mach's
principle throws doubt

05:20.680 --> 05:24.160
on Newton's explanation for
the spinning bucket of water.

05:24.161 --> 05:25.630
So does your theory, Professor.

05:25.631 --> 05:27.929
You know my work?

05:27.930 --> 05:29.749
I've read special
relativity a dozen times,

05:29.750 --> 05:30.963
but I have a question.

05:30.964 --> 05:33.709
Just one? I've got hundreds myself.

05:33.710 --> 05:34.761
(others chuckle)

05:34.762 --> 05:37.222
Special relativity only
applies to constant speeds.

05:37.223 --> 05:41.023
What about acceleration?

05:41.024 --> 05:44.089
That's a question I've been
struggling with for years,

05:44.090 --> 05:47.704
but, unfortunately,
I'm late for an appointment.

06:00.984 --> 06:03.922
You look handsome tonight, Babu.

06:03.923 --> 06:05.549
Not now, Miza.

06:05.550 --> 06:07.401
(whispering): It's okay,
the children are asleep.

06:07.402 --> 06:09.867
Please, get dressed.
We're going to be late.

06:11.714 --> 06:14.108
The last thing I want to
do is paint on a smile

06:14.109 --> 06:15.969
and chatter about the
weather with strangers.

06:17.655 --> 06:20.145
We hardly ever have any
time for ourselves anymore.

06:20.146 --> 06:23.243
Please, Miza, you look very beautiful,

06:23.244 --> 06:25.191
but this invitation is an honor.

06:25.192 --> 06:26.569
We cannot cancel.

06:28.768 --> 06:31.360
Perhaps you should go without me.

06:33.496 --> 06:35.571
As you wish.

06:35.572 --> 06:37.493
(kisses)

06:40.522 --> 06:41.644
Brandy?

06:41.645 --> 06:42.666
EINSTEIN: No, thank you, Dr. Jung.

06:42.667 --> 06:44.805
It makes my thoughts fuzzy.

06:44.806 --> 06:46.946
Ah, you like to be in control.

06:46.947 --> 06:49.628
This is my laboratory, after all.

06:49.629 --> 06:52.470
And this, this is mine.

06:52.471 --> 06:55.440
It's a pity your wife isn't
well, but I'm glad you're here.

06:55.441 --> 06:57.837
I've been wanting
to discuss your paper:

06:57.838 --> 07:00.216
"Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies."

07:00.217 --> 07:01.636
I believe your colleagues
refer to it as,

07:01.637 --> 07:05.628
uh, special relativity.

07:05.629 --> 07:07.545
Have I said something to upset you?

07:07.546 --> 07:09.173
(sighs)

07:09.174 --> 07:12.175
Honestly, I-I wish I could just
move beyond the damn theory.

07:12.176 --> 07:15.401
It makes me feel like a,
like a charlatan.

07:15.402 --> 07:18.275
A charlatan?

07:18.276 --> 07:21.053
It's, uh, it's groundbreaking.

07:21.054 --> 07:23.385
Perhaps, but it only covers
a specialized circumstance.

07:23.386 --> 07:25.588
Speed's not always constant.

07:25.589 --> 07:29.197
The world is spinning.
That's a form of acceleration.

07:29.198 --> 07:31.049
The theory disregards that entirely

07:31.050 --> 07:32.870
and it says nothing
at all about gravity.

07:32.871 --> 07:36.505
The theory is still
incomplete. I'm stalled.

07:36.506 --> 07:38.937
And to make matters worse,
I've been asked to lecture on it

07:38.938 --> 07:41.812
at a conference in Salzburg.

07:41.813 --> 07:43.409
I'm thinking about saying no.

07:43.410 --> 07:46.922
Oh. I imagine you'd
disappoint a lot of people.

07:46.923 --> 07:49.636
I despise lecturing; it-it unnerves me.

07:49.637 --> 07:51.584
(sighs)

07:51.585 --> 07:54.651
I can't believe
I prattled on like that.

07:54.652 --> 07:56.917
I can have that effect on people.

07:56.918 --> 07:59.217
With my patients, I've found

07:59.218 --> 08:01.931
whatever's troubling
them on the surface,

08:01.932 --> 08:03.911
fear of speaking, for example,

08:03.912 --> 08:06.785
there's something much more fascinating

08:06.786 --> 08:08.702
lurking in the unconscious.

08:08.703 --> 08:12.056
With respect, Doctor,
I'd rather not be analyzed.

08:12.057 --> 08:14.003
I'd prefer to remain in the dark.

08:14.004 --> 08:16.143
(chuckles) Forgive me.

08:16.144 --> 08:20.358
I invited you here for
a chat, not analysis.

08:20.359 --> 08:22.947
But may I offer
a friendly piece of advice?

08:22.948 --> 08:24.709
How can I refuse?

08:25.788 --> 08:28.663
A man can't avoid his fears.

08:28.664 --> 08:30.734
To overcome them,

08:30.735 --> 08:33.969
he must face them, pass
through the inferno.

08:43.227 --> 08:45.685
(buzzing)

08:45.686 --> 08:48.246
(sighs)

08:49.900 --> 08:52.334
(elevator rumbling)

09:02.963 --> 09:05.300
Mezzanine, please.

09:08.519 --> 09:09.931
(elevator rumbling, thuds)

09:21.135 --> 09:22.993
Mezzanine, sir.

09:35.507 --> 09:38.475
MINKOWSKI: Good afternoon, Professor.

09:38.476 --> 09:40.716
Are you feeling all right?

09:42.212 --> 09:45.086
Professor Planck,
Professor Minkowski, I...

09:45.087 --> 09:46.362
Spit it out, Einstein.

09:46.363 --> 09:47.961
This is no time to be tongue-tied.

09:47.962 --> 09:49.588
You're this afternoon's
headliner, after all.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.505
(chuckles) Frankly, I never imagined

09:51.506 --> 09:53.614
a student I once called a lazy dog

09:53.615 --> 09:56.264
would produce something as
beautiful as special relativity.

09:56.265 --> 09:58.659
Indeed. Our colleagues
have been anticipating

09:58.660 --> 10:00.287
your lecture for weeks.

10:00.288 --> 10:02.587
Your theory is all we talk about.

10:02.588 --> 10:04.604
(chuckles)

10:07.155 --> 10:09.555
(applause)

10:16.001 --> 10:18.433
(clears throat)

10:28.904 --> 10:32.288
I know what you are
all expecting to hear, but...

10:32.289 --> 10:35.480
today, I would like to talk to you

10:35.481 --> 10:37.812
about something other than relativity.

10:37.813 --> 10:41.618
(murmuring)

10:52.377 --> 10:56.462
EINSTEIN: <i>According to the
prevailing theory, an oscillating...</i>

10:56.463 --> 10:59.433
<i>...the next stage in the
development of theoretical...</i>

10:59.434 --> 11:02.371
<i>...and emission theories applies</i>

11:02.372 --> 11:03.745
<i>to the following conjecture.</i>

11:03.746 --> 11:05.565
<i>...can only assume energy...</i>

11:05.566 --> 11:08.796
(continues low, indistinct)

11:09.877 --> 11:12.272
And so...

11:12.273 --> 11:16.838
if we accept
Professor Planck's constant,

11:16.839 --> 11:19.330
it means, in short,

11:19.331 --> 11:23.864
that much of what we thought
we knew about light...

11:23.865 --> 11:26.041
is wrong.

11:32.109 --> 11:33.552
(clapping)

11:38.465 --> 11:39.972
Bravo!

11:46.737 --> 11:48.140
Brilliant, Albert.

11:48.141 --> 11:51.021
But why on Earth didn't you
lecture on relativity?

11:52.964 --> 11:55.071
When I saw you in the front row, sir,

11:55.072 --> 11:57.754
I-I... I had an inspiration.

11:57.755 --> 12:00.308
You see, your work is the foundation...

12:00.309 --> 12:02.033
Professor Einstein.

12:02.034 --> 12:03.183
Do forgive the interruption.

12:03.184 --> 12:05.291
Count Von Sturgkh,

12:05.292 --> 12:07.941
Minister of Education for the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

12:07.942 --> 12:11.039
I wanted to inform you
that there is a post open

12:11.040 --> 12:13.563
for a Professor of Theoretical Physics

12:13.564 --> 12:15.990
at Karl-Ferdinand University in Prague.

12:15.991 --> 12:19.956
We would be honored
to add you to our faculty.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.260
Well, I'm flattered.

12:22.261 --> 12:23.964
I think you'll find our
terms quite generous.

12:23.965 --> 12:26.177
Limited teaching duties.

12:26.178 --> 12:28.541
Ample time to focus on your own work.

12:28.542 --> 12:30.871
Well, that doesn't sound
too terrible, does it?

12:30.872 --> 12:32.277
Wonderful.

12:32.278 --> 12:33.624
One more question.

12:35.152 --> 12:36.683
They want me to declare a religion.

12:36.684 --> 12:39.144
What has that got to do
with teaching physics?

12:39.145 --> 12:41.506
It's called the Holy Crown
for a reason, Albert.

12:41.507 --> 12:43.167
You must at least pretend
to believe in God

12:43.168 --> 12:44.508
if you want them to hire you.

12:44.509 --> 12:46.010
Perhaps I'm being foolish.

12:46.011 --> 12:48.278
Why would I leave democratic
Switzerland to work

12:48.279 --> 12:50.736
for a medieval, warmongering monarchy?

12:50.737 --> 12:51.854
Since when do you care about

12:51.855 --> 12:53.770
- the stupidities of politics?
- I don't.

12:53.771 --> 12:55.462
I care about completing my theory.

12:55.463 --> 12:56.867
Well, there's your answer.

12:56.868 --> 12:59.039
You've been complaining
about not having time.

12:59.040 --> 13:02.074
Swallow your pride
and admit you're a Jew.

13:02.075 --> 13:05.331
A Jew? Oh, they'll love that.

13:05.332 --> 13:07.764
♪ ♪

13:54.226 --> 13:55.567
Professor Einstein,

13:55.568 --> 13:57.738
Von Sturgkh here tells me

13:57.739 --> 14:00.459
you're one of the greatest
minds in Europe.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.716
He's being too kind, Your Majesty.

14:05.403 --> 14:08.601
He also tells me you're a Jew.

14:12.047 --> 14:13.770
Yes. (clears throat)

14:13.771 --> 14:15.621
Well, my parents...

14:15.622 --> 14:19.040
You understand, we are
not like the Prussians.

14:19.041 --> 14:23.894
Herr Einstein, we have
no quarrel with the Jews,

14:23.895 --> 14:27.350
as long as you are God-fearing.

14:31.496 --> 14:34.082
Oh, I am, Your Majesty.

14:34.083 --> 14:36.419
Terrified, actually.

14:39.895 --> 14:42.927
EINSTEIN: <i>I'd like to
continue our work together,</i>

14:42.928 --> 14:44.813
so why don't you come to
Prague with me, Jakob?

14:44.814 --> 14:47.558
Maybe I could get you a
position at the University.

14:47.559 --> 14:50.432
We'd have time to work
on accelerated motion.

14:50.433 --> 14:53.082
Albert, I'm flattered,

14:53.083 --> 14:54.680
but I've received another offer.

14:54.681 --> 14:55.638
A professorship?

14:55.639 --> 14:58.673
No. Assistant to Philipp Lenard.

14:58.674 --> 15:01.706
Well, Lenard's a genius.
Of course, you must accept.

15:01.707 --> 15:06.242
Yes, but he's got
a bit of a reputation.

15:06.243 --> 15:08.317
Quite a taskmaster, apparently.

15:08.318 --> 15:11.000
Honestly, I get a pit in my
stomach just thinking about it.

15:11.001 --> 15:12.597
I know how you feel.

15:12.598 --> 15:15.342
In Salzburg, I was so
nervous before my lecture,

15:15.343 --> 15:17.260
I thought my heart was going to stop

15:17.261 --> 15:19.239
right in the elevator.

15:19.240 --> 15:24.286
Actually, I... I imagined
something very strange,

15:24.287 --> 15:27.798
as though the elevator were falling,

15:27.799 --> 15:30.257
and I was just floating inside it.

15:30.258 --> 15:32.658
(elevator thuds, Einstein gasps)

15:36.421 --> 15:38.119
<i>It was terrifying at first...</i>

15:39.839 --> 15:45.172
<i>...but then, suddenly,
it was as if, well...</i>

15:45.173 --> 15:48.148
<i>...as if I had no weight at all.</i>

15:51.592 --> 15:55.807
Because a falling man
does not feel his own weight.

15:55.808 --> 15:58.265
<i>Me,</i>

15:58.266 --> 15:59.671
the floor, my papers,

15:59.672 --> 16:01.619
<i>were all falling at the same rate,</i>

16:01.620 --> 16:03.886
<i>so I couldn't feel the pressure
of the floor on my feet.</i>

16:03.887 --> 16:06.543
But what if the elevator was rising?

16:08.646 --> 16:10.082
<i>I'd be accelerating</i>

16:10.083 --> 16:11.295
in the opposite direction.

16:11.296 --> 16:12.829
It would produce the opposite effect.

16:12.830 --> 16:14.106
LAUB: <i>You'd feel the floor.</i>

16:14.107 --> 16:15.364
EINSTEIN: <i>I'd be glued to it,</i>

16:15.365 --> 16:16.500
<i>as I am now.</i>

16:16.501 --> 16:18.480
But that's gravity.

16:18.481 --> 16:20.243
Exactly!

16:21.707 --> 16:23.527
I should have seen it before.

16:23.528 --> 16:26.656
It is so simple, so beautiful.

16:26.657 --> 16:29.563
Acceleration and gravity
are the same thing.

16:29.564 --> 16:33.971
This is the idea I've been
missing to complete relativity.

16:33.972 --> 16:36.237
(chuckles) This may just be

16:36.238 --> 16:38.647
one of the happiest
thoughts of my life.

16:44.461 --> 16:46.153
I know you've been unhappy here,

16:46.154 --> 16:48.037
but things will be better in Prague.

16:48.038 --> 16:50.465
Why should I be happy in a new city?

16:50.466 --> 16:51.939
It will just be more of the same.

16:53.020 --> 16:54.521
Wash dishes,

16:54.522 --> 16:57.874
change diapers, buy groceries.

16:57.875 --> 17:01.162
I might as well be a
mule tied to a cart.

17:01.163 --> 17:03.684
When do I get to use my mind?

17:03.685 --> 17:05.569
Miza, you've had dark moods
since you were a child.

17:05.570 --> 17:06.528
It will pass.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.417
This is not a mood, Mama!

17:09.722 --> 17:11.159
I'm suffocating.

17:11.160 --> 17:12.469
You should count your blessings.

17:12.470 --> 17:13.873
There was a time I thought you would

17:13.874 --> 17:15.316
never have a man at all.

17:17.387 --> 17:20.549
Maybe I would have been
better off without one.

17:20.550 --> 17:23.487
How can you say that?

17:23.488 --> 17:25.473
What about your children?

17:38.657 --> 17:41.568
Don't listen to Mama, Eduard.

17:45.077 --> 17:47.987
Sometimes Mama gets sad.

17:51.113 --> 17:53.146
JUNG: <i>People don't try
to kill themselves</i>

17:53.147 --> 17:55.197
for no reason, Eduard.

17:55.935 --> 17:57.786
You must be in despair about something.

17:57.787 --> 17:59.766
Trouble with a woman,

17:59.767 --> 18:01.720
or a disappointment at school.

18:11.903 --> 18:13.340
I'm sorry.

18:13.341 --> 18:15.676
Do you-do you mind if I smoke?

18:19.983 --> 18:22.350
It reminds me of my father.

18:23.944 --> 18:26.075
JUNG: <i>When was the last time
you saw your father?</i>

18:26.076 --> 18:27.200
Not for years.

18:27.201 --> 18:28.956
Oh.

18:28.957 --> 18:31.382
That must be, uh, difficult.

18:31.383 --> 18:32.884
No.

18:32.885 --> 18:34.577
No, it's not hard at all.

18:34.578 --> 18:36.403
You see...

18:38.666 --> 18:40.651
...I hate him.

18:42.777 --> 18:45.038
Prague's a caste system.

18:45.039 --> 18:47.233
Germans on top, Jews in the middle

18:47.234 --> 18:49.213
and the poor Czechs beneath them both.

18:49.214 --> 18:52.132
- Why does anyone put up with it?
- It has one advantage.

18:52.133 --> 18:55.549
They say that suffering
is necessary for art.

18:55.550 --> 18:57.337
Ah, so you're an artist.

18:57.338 --> 18:59.318
I could claim to be a writer,

18:59.319 --> 19:01.138
but the truth is

19:01.139 --> 19:03.725
I work in a civil service office.

19:03.726 --> 19:05.385
It's killing my soul.

19:05.386 --> 19:06.663
I understand.

19:06.664 --> 19:08.164
I worked as a clerk for many years.

19:08.165 --> 19:11.198
Did it make you feel like a cockroach?

19:11.199 --> 19:12.666
What an interesting metaphor.

19:12.667 --> 19:13.976
You think so?

19:13.977 --> 19:17.521
Professor, I see you've met Herr Kafka.

19:17.522 --> 19:19.852
Franz is too shy to tell
you, but he's published

19:19.853 --> 19:21.289
some short stories.

19:21.290 --> 19:23.397
They are quite modern.

19:23.398 --> 19:28.923
I think intellect is the most
fascinating part of a man.

19:28.924 --> 19:30.359
I find Czech an interesting language.

19:30.360 --> 19:32.626
Slavonic, but without
the Cyrillic alphabet.

19:32.627 --> 19:37.577
It must be so intimidating
being married to a genius.

19:37.578 --> 19:41.728
I'd always be afraid to say
something stupid.

19:41.729 --> 19:44.129
(whispering)

19:44.731 --> 19:47.222
Not at all.

19:47.223 --> 19:50.320
He's the one who's
always being foolish.

19:50.321 --> 19:52.337
(talking low)

19:53.226 --> 19:56.393
Albert, I've got a headache.
Take me home.

20:04.117 --> 20:05.904
If it's not your hip, it's your head.

20:05.905 --> 20:08.779
When was the last time you
actually enjoyed yourself?

20:08.780 --> 20:10.983
It's not my fault everyone
in this city is rude.

20:10.984 --> 20:11.972
They're rude?

20:11.973 --> 20:13.185
You spent the night scowling

20:13.186 --> 20:14.527
like a scolded child.

20:14.528 --> 20:16.242
We don't know anyone in this city.

20:16.243 --> 20:17.542
I thought you'd want to meet people.

20:17.543 --> 20:19.755
Then why didn't you
introduce me to anyone?

20:19.756 --> 20:21.500
It's bad enough I'm
invisible to everyone else,

20:21.501 --> 20:22.724
then you ignore me, too.

20:22.725 --> 20:24.568
I was simply talking with other people.

20:24.569 --> 20:25.443
Yes.

20:25.444 --> 20:27.967
You had plenty to say
to that chesty brunette.

20:30.486 --> 20:33.008
Don't worry, I'm sure you'll
have a wonderful time

20:33.009 --> 20:34.573
without me at your very important

20:34.574 --> 20:36.138
conference in Brussels.

20:36.139 --> 20:38.883
I'm surprised you're not
attending the Solvay Conference,

20:38.884 --> 20:39.969
Herr Professor.

20:39.970 --> 20:41.470
I'm far too busy to take time away

20:41.471 --> 20:42.780
for a trip to Brussels.

20:42.781 --> 20:44.761
I'm sure your colleagues will miss you.

20:44.762 --> 20:46.039
Schinz, this is Laub.

20:46.040 --> 20:47.379
He's going to be working with us.

20:47.380 --> 20:49.934
Show him the equipment,
explain our procedures.

20:49.935 --> 20:51.728
Yes, Herr Professor.

20:53.608 --> 20:56.193
You shouldn't have asked
him about Solvay.

20:56.194 --> 20:57.950
He wasn't invited.

20:57.951 --> 21:00.632
My God, how could I be so stupid?

21:00.633 --> 21:03.507
Now, you must tell me about Einstein.

21:03.508 --> 21:06.860
Is he as brilliant as everyone says?

21:06.861 --> 21:09.191
SOMMERFELD: <i>You are not
a true gentleman, sir.</i>

21:09.192 --> 21:12.545
And you are not a true blonde, madam.

21:12.546 --> 21:14.492
(mild laughter)

21:14.493 --> 21:17.851
I must remember that one, Sommerfeld.

21:19.986 --> 21:21.424
Isn't that Madame Curie?

21:21.425 --> 21:24.878
SOMMERFELD: What gave
her away, the dress?

21:29.505 --> 21:30.908
Why isn't anyone talking to her?

21:30.909 --> 21:32.409
Haven't you heard?

21:32.410 --> 21:35.730
She's been cavorting around
Paris with a married man.

21:35.731 --> 21:38.668
Why is that anyone's business?

21:38.669 --> 21:40.266
SOMMERFELD: It's been splashed

21:40.267 --> 21:41.766
across the French papers for days.

21:41.767 --> 21:43.746
It's a terrible disgrace
to her late husband.

21:43.747 --> 21:45.759
Poincaire thinks

21:45.760 --> 21:49.687
she should be asked to
leave the conference.

21:49.688 --> 21:51.289
EINSTEIN: Excuse me.

21:55.723 --> 21:58.118
Madame Curie.

21:58.119 --> 22:00.673
I'm Albert Einstein.

22:00.674 --> 22:02.620
I've heard some gossip about you.

22:02.621 --> 22:04.185
I'm sure you have.

22:04.186 --> 22:06.931
The rumor is...

22:06.932 --> 22:09.365
that you're going to
win another Nobel Prize.

22:12.586 --> 22:14.087
Don't worry about them.

22:14.088 --> 22:16.103
Their jokes are worse
than their manners.

22:17.217 --> 22:19.809
Then you'll fit right in,
Herr Einstein.

22:23.540 --> 22:25.193
MARIE: <i>People floating weightless,</i>

22:25.194 --> 22:27.819
elevators flying through space.

22:27.820 --> 22:30.469
You have the imagination
of a poet, not a scientist.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.864
You wouldn't think so
if you read my poetry.

22:32.865 --> 22:35.419
(laughs)

22:35.420 --> 22:37.719
Let's assume you are right about
acceleration and gravity.

22:37.720 --> 22:41.167
You had better prepare yourself
for tremendous resistance

22:41.168 --> 22:42.541
from our colleagues.

22:42.542 --> 22:46.278
You'll be murdering
one of their sacred cows.

22:46.279 --> 22:48.865
Sooner or later,
they'll realize that I'm right.

22:48.866 --> 22:51.228
Only if you can prove it.

22:51.229 --> 22:54.453
I'd imagine the mathematics
must be very complex.

22:54.454 --> 22:56.274
If I was back in Zurich,

22:56.275 --> 22:58.892
I'd have my friend
Grossmann to help me.

22:58.893 --> 23:02.183
But in Prague, my colleagues
are all absolutely useless.

23:02.184 --> 23:04.417
When Pierre was alive,

23:04.418 --> 23:08.027
we had the luxury of always
being there to help each other.

23:08.028 --> 23:10.549
I once had that with my wife.

23:10.550 --> 23:12.977
Ah, she's also a scientist.

23:12.978 --> 23:14.893
She studied physics, yes.

23:14.894 --> 23:16.718
And now?

23:26.453 --> 23:28.305
(Einstein sighs)

23:28.306 --> 23:32.490
EINSTEIN: <i>I think, of all the
mysteries in the universe,</i>

23:32.491 --> 23:35.337
people are the hardest
for me to fathom.

23:39.549 --> 23:41.821
But my wife is really quite brilliant.

23:43.349 --> 23:45.742
(door opens)

23:45.743 --> 23:48.107
Have you been with someone in Brussels?

23:48.108 --> 23:49.576
With someone?

23:49.577 --> 23:51.267
What... what, what do you mean?

23:51.268 --> 23:52.896
This woman.

23:52.897 --> 23:55.265
Did she meet you there?

24:01.104 --> 24:02.668
(laughs softly, scoffs)

24:02.669 --> 24:05.990
This is from that silly girl
I met at that party.

24:05.991 --> 24:09.318
Why is she writing to you
in such a trifling way?

24:10.430 --> 24:12.984
You can't possibly be jealous, Miza.

24:12.985 --> 24:14.806
Have you been intimate with her?

24:14.807 --> 24:17.456
Intimate? I, I have never
been unfaithful to you.

24:17.457 --> 24:19.692
How dare you! (bangs table)

24:19.693 --> 24:22.916
You certainly don't seem
interested in me anymore.

24:22.917 --> 24:24.257
Actually, you know what, Mileva?

24:24.258 --> 24:26.015
I was with a woman in Brussels.

24:26.016 --> 24:27.674
You admit it.

24:27.675 --> 24:30.422
It was your heroine, Marie Curie.

24:30.423 --> 24:32.785
I spent hours talking to her,

24:32.786 --> 24:34.318
told her all about you.

24:34.319 --> 24:37.209
She even said she'd want
to meet you one day.

24:37.210 --> 24:40.657
But if she knew what a
suspicious, jealous creature

24:40.658 --> 24:42.196
you really are.

24:44.970 --> 24:46.916
(door closes)

24:46.917 --> 24:50.271
BESSO: Prague is even more
beautiful than people say.

24:50.272 --> 24:53.784
EINSTEIN: Prague is a like
pretty girl with a cold heart.

24:53.785 --> 24:56.371
None of my colleagues
are of any use to me.

24:56.372 --> 24:57.488
I've asked Grossmann to see

24:57.489 --> 24:58.980
if he can help me get a position

24:58.981 --> 25:00.362
at Zurich Polytechnic.

25:00.363 --> 25:02.852
Does Mileva want to move again so soon?

25:02.853 --> 25:05.024
She hates it here.

25:05.025 --> 25:08.539
But then, I don't think
she'd be happy anywhere.

25:08.540 --> 25:10.454
Forget about gloomy topics.

25:10.455 --> 25:12.690
What did you think of
my elevator thought experiment?

25:12.691 --> 25:14.669
Mm. I'm still up in the air about it.

25:14.670 --> 25:16.267
(chuckles)

25:16.268 --> 25:19.939
I've realized another wonderful
consequence of my idea.

25:19.940 --> 25:21.090
Hmm.

25:21.091 --> 25:24.601
Gravity bends light.

25:24.602 --> 25:27.444
That is a completely new
conception, Albert.

25:27.445 --> 25:29.105
But even if you're right,

25:29.106 --> 25:31.820
you'd need a huge gravitational
force to show it.

25:31.821 --> 25:34.470
The sun would do, wouldn't it?

25:34.471 --> 25:36.871
(barge whistle blowing)

25:38.047 --> 25:41.688
Imagine that log is a
particle of light.

25:41.689 --> 25:45.489
Now think of the river as space.

25:45.490 --> 25:48.426
And you see the barge, there?

25:48.427 --> 25:49.991
That's the sun.

25:49.992 --> 25:52.136
Now watch.

25:55.006 --> 25:59.062
The sun's gravity changes
the shape of space.

25:59.063 --> 26:03.116
I will credit you for
originality, Albert.

26:03.117 --> 26:06.023
But is it possible that
you've gone a bit too far?

26:06.024 --> 26:08.960
No. It's so beautiful
that it must be right.

26:08.961 --> 26:10.883
And an astronomer could prove it.

26:11.996 --> 26:15.029
Then I suppose you'd better
find a good astronomer.

26:15.030 --> 26:16.721
PLANCK: <i>I do know</i>

26:16.722 --> 26:18.541
some astronomers at the University,

26:18.542 --> 26:22.629
but frankly, I'm reluctant
to make an introduction.

26:22.630 --> 26:24.801
Reluctant? Why?

26:24.802 --> 26:26.366
To be blunt, I don't know

26:26.367 --> 26:28.378
if it's in your best interest.

26:28.379 --> 26:31.156
How is it not in my interest
to prove my theory?

26:31.157 --> 26:32.690
It's an outlandish idea,

26:32.691 --> 26:35.565
and you might very
well be proven wrong.

26:35.566 --> 26:36.586
I'm not wrong.

26:36.587 --> 26:38.691
But e-even if I were, so what?

26:38.692 --> 26:40.456
Scientists must take risks.

26:40.457 --> 26:42.660
Otherwise we'd never
make any advancements.

26:42.661 --> 26:45.240
You've established a strong
reputation for yourself.

26:45.241 --> 26:47.924
You should tread carefully.

26:47.925 --> 26:51.091
It's not hard to go
from genius to laughingstock.

26:53.033 --> 26:55.045
I'm staying with my aunt and uncle

26:55.046 --> 26:57.345
while I'm in Berlin.

26:57.346 --> 26:59.108
You can reach me there.

27:01.529 --> 27:03.924
PAULINE: And then Albert
hit her in the head

27:03.925 --> 27:05.263
with a shovel.

27:05.264 --> 27:06.480
(laughter)

27:06.481 --> 27:07.853
I didn't... I didn't really.

27:07.854 --> 27:10.668
You most certainly did... twice.

27:11.526 --> 27:13.441
Ah, Albert,

27:13.442 --> 27:17.727
you must try some of cousin
Elsa's famous goose cracklings.

27:19.127 --> 27:21.618
Who would have imagined
such a little troublemaker

27:21.619 --> 27:23.885
would grow up to be a great scientist?

27:23.886 --> 27:26.859
Now if only someone would teach
him what to do with a hairbrush.

27:28.165 --> 27:30.181
(laughs)

27:32.700 --> 27:36.712
Poor Albert, he's been
so miserable in Prague.

27:36.713 --> 27:38.989
But he's got a prestigious
position there, doesn't he?

27:38.990 --> 27:41.002
It's his wife.

27:41.003 --> 27:44.905
He'd never admit it, but he
regrets the day he married her.

27:50.679 --> 27:52.627
It's so nice to have
you in town, Albert.

27:52.628 --> 27:54.063
The last time I saw you,

27:54.064 --> 27:56.650
you must have been the
same age as my girls.

27:56.651 --> 27:58.343
We always had fun together.

27:58.344 --> 28:00.004
Ah, you liked my sister better than me.

28:00.005 --> 28:02.527
Well, she was nicer to me
than you were.

28:02.528 --> 28:04.572
(laughs softly)

28:04.573 --> 28:06.935
Ugh. Take off your sweater.

28:06.936 --> 28:07.923
What? Why?

28:07.924 --> 28:09.042
You look like a tramp.

28:09.043 --> 28:12.300
Come, give it to me.

28:12.301 --> 28:14.280
I'll mend it for you.

28:14.281 --> 28:18.054
JUNG: <i>Can you tell me why
you're so angry at your father?</i>

28:22.136 --> 28:25.362
I thought you wanted to know why
I tried to jump out the window.

28:25.363 --> 28:27.149
Yes. If you're ready to tell me.

28:27.150 --> 28:29.928
It's not because I'm in despair.

28:29.929 --> 28:31.429
It's because I'm crazy.

28:31.430 --> 28:33.378
And what do you mean by "crazy"?

28:33.379 --> 28:36.858
Mad, schizoid. It runs in my family.

28:36.859 --> 28:39.380
My mother's sister was locked up
in this very same hospital.

28:39.381 --> 28:43.502
So you see, I wasn't
trying to kill myself.

28:43.503 --> 28:45.903
I was having a delusion.

28:47.717 --> 28:49.926
I thought I was on fire.

28:51.678 --> 28:53.082
EINSTEIN: Guess why it's blue.

28:53.083 --> 28:54.201
ELSA: Because it's lonely?

28:54.202 --> 28:57.233
Very clever, but no.

28:57.234 --> 28:59.981
The air forms billions of tiny pockets

28:59.982 --> 29:02.343
that scatter the light from the sun.

29:02.344 --> 29:04.611
The blue light scatters more
than the other wavelengths,

29:04.612 --> 29:06.368
and that's why you see the blue.

29:06.369 --> 29:08.028
That's lovely.

29:08.029 --> 29:09.592
But I can appreciate a blue sky

29:09.593 --> 29:11.542
without knowing anything about physics.

29:11.543 --> 29:13.585
Why would you need to know
anything about physics?

29:13.586 --> 29:16.938
You're a sparkling conversationalist,

29:16.939 --> 29:18.408
a wonderful cook,

29:18.409 --> 29:21.031
a talented seamstress.

29:23.518 --> 29:25.561
Tell me about your wife.

29:25.562 --> 29:27.285
She went to school with you?

29:27.286 --> 29:30.001
Yes. She wanted to be a scientist.

29:30.002 --> 29:31.662
Oh. Is she like you?

29:31.663 --> 29:35.239
Always thinking about big ideas?

29:35.240 --> 29:37.448
Never remembering to take
care of little things?

29:40.541 --> 29:42.902
I have a friend, a psychiatrist,

29:42.903 --> 29:46.671
who thinks that husbands
and wives' psyches

29:46.672 --> 29:50.024
must be in balance.

29:50.025 --> 29:52.840
Mileva and I certainly are not.

29:54.656 --> 29:58.137
You seem discontent.

29:58.138 --> 29:59.732
(sighs)

29:59.733 --> 30:03.087
Mileva's unhappy all the time.

30:03.088 --> 30:06.919
It makes life at home unbearable.

30:06.920 --> 30:11.043
So I find reasons to stay away.

30:12.157 --> 30:14.524
But then I miss my children.

30:15.862 --> 30:18.486
That must be very difficult or you.

30:19.534 --> 30:21.896
But you know,

30:21.897 --> 30:26.113
and I speak from experience,

30:26.114 --> 30:29.792
not every marriage is
meant to last forever.

30:32.277 --> 30:35.540
You deserve to be happy, Albert.

30:51.271 --> 30:53.156
Albert, wait.

30:53.157 --> 30:54.913
I thought you might get hungry

30:54.914 --> 30:57.624
on the journey home.
I made you some butter cookies.

30:57.625 --> 30:59.859
Wherever did you get a rose

30:59.860 --> 31:01.615
at this time of year?

31:01.616 --> 31:03.695
I've got connections all over the city.

31:03.696 --> 31:06.544
Especially for lovely things
like greenhouse flowers.

31:06.545 --> 31:09.359
Speaking of connections, did I
ever mention that I'm acquainted

31:09.360 --> 31:11.888
with Fritz Haber,
at the Prussian Academy?

31:11.889 --> 31:12.880
Haber?

31:12.881 --> 31:14.318
He's legendary.

31:14.319 --> 31:17.327
The man who pulled
nitrogen out of thin air.

31:17.328 --> 31:19.119
I could say something to him.

31:19.120 --> 31:22.582
The Academy would be the perfect
place for you to do your work.

31:24.370 --> 31:26.767
I can't move to Berlin, Elsa.

31:26.768 --> 31:28.240
Why not?

31:28.241 --> 31:30.287
You know I couldn't wait
to get out of Germany

31:30.288 --> 31:32.528
when I was a boy.

31:32.529 --> 31:36.150
If I came back, it would only be
because I want to be with you.

31:37.616 --> 31:40.847
Is that so terrible?

31:40.848 --> 31:45.616
I'd... I'd very much like to...

31:45.617 --> 31:48.239
to be something to you, Elsa,

31:48.240 --> 31:51.248
but there are other people to consider.

31:51.249 --> 31:54.448
Mileva, of course,
but most importantly,

31:54.449 --> 31:58.165
your daughters, and my sons.

31:59.890 --> 32:01.583
JUNG: <i>Fire represents deep parts</i>

32:01.584 --> 32:03.120
of the unconscious.

32:03.121 --> 32:04.335
It's an archetype of transformation.

32:04.336 --> 32:05.840
I have a number of patients who...

32:05.841 --> 32:07.023
Save your archetypal nonsense

32:07.024 --> 32:08.782
for your paying patients.

32:08.783 --> 32:10.159
My neuroses have nothing to do

32:10.160 --> 32:12.208
with your, your outlandish theories,

32:12.209 --> 32:14.742
about the collective unconscious.

32:16.688 --> 32:19.727
I'm studying psychiatry.

32:19.728 --> 32:21.360
And I can tell you,

32:21.361 --> 32:24.023
my neuroses are obviously Freudian.

32:25.136 --> 32:26.800
Freudian in what sense?

32:26.801 --> 32:28.560
Isn't it obvious?

32:28.561 --> 32:30.928
They're all about my father.

32:30.929 --> 32:34.901
I don't see how a delusion about
fire connects with your father.

32:36.016 --> 32:38.287
Quite simple, really.

32:38.288 --> 32:42.065
When I was a child,
he nearly burned me to death.

32:42.066 --> 32:43.537
<i>One night, he was so distracted</i>

32:43.538 --> 32:45.328
<i>by some scientific thought or another,</i>

32:45.329 --> 32:48.023
<i>that he dropped his pipe
and set fire to his bedroom.</i>

32:53.521 --> 32:55.024
Your memory is quite vivid.

32:55.025 --> 32:56.369
How could I forget something like that?

32:56.370 --> 32:57.968
You were just a baby.

32:57.969 --> 33:01.200
It's quite young to remember so much.

33:01.201 --> 33:04.719
Everyone in my family knows the story.

33:04.720 --> 33:06.448
Ah.

33:06.449 --> 33:09.203
My father never
should have had children.

33:10.509 --> 33:11.737
If it wasn't for my mother,

33:11.738 --> 33:13.296
God knows what would have become of us.

33:13.297 --> 33:15.920
Your father is a human being.

33:15.921 --> 33:18.545
Human beings make mistakes.

33:18.546 --> 33:20.561
You study the psyche, Eduard.

33:20.562 --> 33:22.417
Be your own doctor.

33:22.418 --> 33:24.784
What would you tell yourself?

33:24.785 --> 33:27.185
I'd say,

33:27.186 --> 33:31.888
when one's father is a
great and heartless man,

33:31.889 --> 33:36.305
it can make one feel...

33:36.306 --> 33:38.390
quite worthless.

33:40.465 --> 33:46.550
You have made your father into
a kind of archetypal monster.

33:47.825 --> 33:50.837
But are you really sure you're right?

33:56.625 --> 33:58.583
(bucket clatters)

33:59.826 --> 34:02.385
You let the children
get hold of matches?

34:02.386 --> 34:03.601
How could you be so careless?

34:03.602 --> 34:05.041
So sorry. I-I don't know

34:05.042 --> 34:06.576
what's wrong with me lately.

34:06.577 --> 34:08.464
I don't know what's wrong with me.

34:08.465 --> 34:10.703
I'm sorry... I'm sorry.

34:10.704 --> 34:12.119
(Mileva crying)

34:14.449 --> 34:17.362
It's all right, Eduard.

34:17.362 --> 34:19.504
Everything's gonna be all right.

34:19.505 --> 34:20.945
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

34:20.946 --> 34:23.350
(crying)

34:26.418 --> 34:28.438
(crying)

34:32.561 --> 34:35.190
I know you're unhappy here, Miza.

34:38.257 --> 34:41.840
I got a letter from
Marie Curie yesterday.

34:41.841 --> 34:45.462
She's invited us to take a
holiday with her in the Alps.

34:47.121 --> 34:49.329
I think it will do us some
good to get away, hmm?

34:49.330 --> 34:51.766
(crying)

35:03.186 --> 35:05.590
(wind whistling)

35:10.642 --> 35:12.849
I've read all your papers.

35:12.850 --> 35:14.290
(chuckles softly)

35:14.291 --> 35:16.369
They're a bit dry, aren't they?

35:16.370 --> 35:18.321
Oh, not at all.

35:18.322 --> 35:20.177
I'm fascinated by the idea

35:20.178 --> 35:22.898
that radium is in a
perpetual process of decay.

35:22.899 --> 35:25.970
Do you think Rutherford's
theory of sub-atoms

35:25.971 --> 35:28.024
and disintegration is accurate?

35:29.906 --> 35:31.857
I don't know about
Rutherford, but I can see

35:31.858 --> 35:35.222
that you are just as brilliant
as your husband said you are.

35:37.843 --> 35:40.017
It seems foolish now,

35:40.018 --> 35:43.890
but once I dreamed I might
win a Nobel Prize, too.

35:43.891 --> 35:45.778
Hmm.

35:45.779 --> 35:50.008
But then, life and... children.

35:52.307 --> 35:54.807
How did you do it all?

35:56.658 --> 35:58.771
I didn't. (chuckles)

35:58.772 --> 36:01.299
My children hardly saw me.

36:01.300 --> 36:04.600
Now, I'm afraid they hate me.

36:05.651 --> 36:07.506
I'm sorry.

36:07.507 --> 36:11.090
I didn't realize.

36:11.091 --> 36:13.239
You are very lucky, Mileva.

36:14.867 --> 36:17.464
Your children obviously adore you.

36:24.466 --> 36:27.447
My husband doesn't.

36:29.139 --> 36:32.337
Not anymore.

36:32.338 --> 36:34.929
MARIE: <i>Mileva's got a wonderful mind.</i>

36:34.930 --> 36:37.042
(chuckles)

36:37.043 --> 36:40.369
I can see why you were drawn to her.

36:40.370 --> 36:44.498
That feels like eons ago.

36:44.499 --> 36:46.066
Love is a chemical reaction.

36:46.067 --> 36:49.079
Sometimes, it burns itself out.

36:51.860 --> 36:54.552
I miss what Mileva and I had.

36:56.372 --> 36:59.442
Don't you sometimes think that, well,

36:59.443 --> 37:02.488
life isn't worth living
without someone to love.

37:04.307 --> 37:06.391
Perhaps you'll find someone else.

37:11.924 --> 37:13.682
(sighs)

37:13.683 --> 37:17.105
Mileva's so fragile.

37:17.106 --> 37:19.377
I... (sighs)

37:19.378 --> 37:22.519
I couldn't bear to hurt my children.

37:24.372 --> 37:25.907
I tell you something, Albert,

37:25.908 --> 37:29.267
because I think you'll understand.

37:29.268 --> 37:32.279
The rumors about my affair
with Paul Langevin were true.

37:34.291 --> 37:37.170
I don't feel any guilt
about it; we fell in love.

37:37.171 --> 37:39.666
So, why should we have
to deny our feelings

37:39.667 --> 37:42.104
just because of an
old-fashioned social contract?

37:43.732 --> 37:45.970
You and I don't accept all
the rules and conventions

37:45.971 --> 37:47.666
of science.

37:47.667 --> 37:50.840
So, why must we accept
traditional marriage?

37:57.492 --> 37:59.731
ELSA: <i>The houses held onto each other</i>

37:59.732 --> 38:02.451
tight that night.

38:02.452 --> 38:06.899
And I kissed the moon and cried.

38:06.900 --> 38:09.907
That was "Longing" by
Henriette Hardenberg.

38:09.908 --> 38:11.385
(applause)

38:15.123 --> 38:18.579
Professor Haber, I'm so
glad you could be here.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.345
You were quite charming.

38:22.228 --> 38:25.465
Have I ever mentioned that
my cousin is Albert Einstein?

38:26.579 --> 38:28.370
He's making quite a name for himself.

38:28.371 --> 38:30.162
In Prague now, I believe.

38:30.163 --> 38:31.923
Actually, he's moved back to Zurich.

38:31.924 --> 38:34.228
But I think he's rather restless there.

38:34.229 --> 38:36.211
A mind like his, I'm sure he'd prefer

38:36.212 --> 38:38.392
a more stimulating
scientific community.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.746
LENARD: <i>What is this fascination</i>

38:41.747 --> 38:43.539
with Einstein?

38:43.540 --> 38:45.907
What do his so-called "thought
experiments" even mean?

38:45.908 --> 38:48.851
Where are these trains and
lightning bolts he writes about?

38:48.852 --> 38:50.739
He's the most original thinker
in the world right now.

38:50.740 --> 38:52.146
Just the kind of man we want

38:52.147 --> 38:53.522
- in the Academy.
- He's a dreamer,

38:53.523 --> 38:55.506
not a rigorous scientist.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.587
Hasn't he just taken a post in Zurich?

38:57.588 --> 38:59.026
Yes,

38:59.027 --> 39:03.091
but I've been told he'd
prefer to do without

39:03.092 --> 39:05.619
his lecturing obligations.

39:05.620 --> 39:08.244
Germany needs men like him.

39:08.245 --> 39:09.779
If I'm not mistaken,

39:09.780 --> 39:11.993
he renounced his German
citizenship many years ago.

39:13.844 --> 39:16.921
Perhaps it's best
we let the Swiss keep him.

39:18.484 --> 39:20.020
It's good to see you again, Carl.

39:20.021 --> 39:21.746
JUNG: I was surprised
you came back to Zurich

39:21.747 --> 39:23.826
so soon.

39:23.827 --> 39:27.380
My wife despised Prague.
But, uh, more importantly,

39:27.381 --> 39:30.803
I'm hoping Zurich will be better
for my children, healthier.

39:30.804 --> 39:34.804
Especially little Eduard.
He's... he's a bit sickly.

39:34.805 --> 39:36.211
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

39:36.212 --> 39:37.684
But don't misunderstand me.

39:37.685 --> 39:41.138
He's a remarkable child,
amazingly bright.

39:41.139 --> 39:44.146
He started talking much sooner
than his older brother.

39:44.147 --> 39:46.643
And he has a wonderful gift for music.

39:46.644 --> 39:50.611
Oh. Well, he's lucky to
have such a proud papa.

39:50.612 --> 39:52.818
Oh, allow me.

39:52.819 --> 39:55.410
(coins clink on table)

39:55.411 --> 39:58.451
Four francs, a magical number.

39:58.452 --> 40:01.362
You don't actually believe
in magic, do you?

40:01.363 --> 40:03.124
I am not sure about magic,

40:03.125 --> 40:05.459
but I know that four
is a very special number.

40:05.460 --> 40:07.026
You're serious?

40:07.027 --> 40:09.300
Indeed, four is fundamental.

40:09.301 --> 40:10.931
There's four elements:

40:10.932 --> 40:13.811
earth, air, fire and water;
four poles of the compass;

40:13.812 --> 40:15.701
and four poles of the psyche:

40:15.702 --> 40:19.220
thinking, feeling, sensation
and intuition.

40:19.221 --> 40:21.523
And who knows, Albert?

40:21.524 --> 40:22.900
Perhaps...

40:22.901 --> 40:24.922
there is even a fourth dimension.

40:34.260 --> 40:36.787
EDUARD: <i>So, what's your
diagnosis, Doctor?</i>

40:36.788 --> 40:39.028
Schizoid with delusions?

40:39.029 --> 40:41.332
I am a friend

40:41.333 --> 40:42.612
of the family

40:42.613 --> 40:46.259
so, I wanted to come
and see you personally,

40:46.260 --> 40:49.106
but I think it would
be more appropriate

40:49.107 --> 40:51.572
if you worked with one
of my colleagues.

40:51.573 --> 40:53.363
Oh, I see.

40:53.364 --> 40:55.219
As usual, a visit from an eminent man

40:55.220 --> 40:56.563
has nothing to do with me.

40:56.564 --> 40:58.932
It's only because of my great

40:58.933 --> 41:00.506
and very important father.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.291
I understand you are...

41:06.292 --> 41:08.307
quite an admirer of Freud.

41:08.308 --> 41:11.060
That's right. And don't try
to tell me he's a charlatan,

41:11.061 --> 41:12.659
because I'm quite sure

41:12.660 --> 41:15.252
he's understood the human
psyche better than anyone.

41:15.253 --> 41:17.940
I once thought so, too.

41:17.941 --> 41:22.266
In fact, he was like a father to me.

41:24.181 --> 41:27.380
But I was young then,

41:27.381 --> 41:29.972
my ego got in the way.

41:29.973 --> 41:33.843
Now, we haven't spoken for...

41:33.844 --> 41:36.308
a very long time.

41:36.309 --> 41:40.213
I said some terrible things to him,

41:40.214 --> 41:45.205
and I never had the humility
to ask him to forgive me.

41:45.206 --> 41:47.354
I wonder if he could.

41:49.972 --> 41:52.730
I wonder if I could forgive him.

42:00.885 --> 42:04.628
(footfalls receding)

42:04.629 --> 42:08.468
(door opens, closes)

42:08.469 --> 42:10.427
(classical music playing)

42:14.102 --> 42:15.860
Oh, look.

42:15.861 --> 42:20.340
Imagine what it would be like to
be that little spider, Teddy.

42:20.341 --> 42:23.892
Going round and round,

42:23.893 --> 42:26.614
the world must look very...

42:26.615 --> 42:29.749
very different.

42:29.750 --> 42:31.509
My God.

42:31.510 --> 42:34.747
MILEVA: Someone's here to see you.

42:35.894 --> 42:37.210
Go with Mama.

42:38.229 --> 42:41.588
Herr Professor,
what an unexpected pleasure.

42:41.589 --> 42:43.604
What-what brings you to Zurich?

42:43.605 --> 42:45.940
Well, to begin with, I've
found you an astronomer.

42:45.941 --> 42:47.508
Name is Freundlich.

42:47.509 --> 42:49.141
He's young, but ambitious.

42:49.142 --> 42:50.931
You must tell me
all about him, but first,

42:50.932 --> 42:53.684
take a look at the
spider on the record.

42:53.685 --> 42:55.189
Ah.

42:55.190 --> 42:58.389
<i>Agelena labyrinthica,</i> I think.

42:58.390 --> 42:59.668
- So, you know each other?
- (chuckles)

42:59.669 --> 43:01.109
Ask her what's the ratio

43:01.110 --> 43:03.924
of the diameter of the record
to the circumference.

43:03.925 --> 43:05.940
Pi, of course.

43:05.941 --> 43:08.086
Not to the spider, it isn't.

43:08.087 --> 43:10.804
Because of relativity, the
circumference is shorter

43:10.805 --> 43:13.332
in the direction of rotation.

43:13.333 --> 43:16.109
- I'm not sure I follow.
- This beautiful

43:16.110 --> 43:18.133
little creature has given me the key

43:18.134 --> 43:20.213
to formulating general relativity.

43:20.214 --> 43:23.124
It cannot be done with
three-dimensional geometry.

43:23.125 --> 43:26.005
Dr. Jung made me realize
Minkowski was right.

43:26.006 --> 43:27.507
I need four dimensions.

43:27.508 --> 43:30.869
This is wonderful, don't you see?

43:30.870 --> 43:35.035
I hope that you'll think
that this is wonderful, too.

43:39.285 --> 43:41.626
The Prussian Academy.

43:45.301 --> 43:47.834
It's an official offer.

43:51.351 --> 43:54.486
My God. It's good money.

43:54.487 --> 43:55.707
Mm.

43:56.822 --> 43:58.870
But I don't know if I can accept.

43:58.871 --> 44:01.109
I thought you'd be thrilled.

44:01.110 --> 44:03.222
It's complicated. Berlin is...

44:03.223 --> 44:05.212
Berlin is what?

44:06.967 --> 44:10.069
I'm sorry,
I need some time to consider.

44:10.070 --> 44:12.213
It wasn't easy for us to get
you this offer, Albert.

44:12.214 --> 44:16.731
I can't very well go back
to Berlin without an answer.

44:17.814 --> 44:20.725
Why don't you take a little hike
up Mount Kaferberg?

44:20.726 --> 44:22.293
A hike?

44:22.294 --> 44:24.726
It's a lovely view of the city.
It'll take you two hours.

44:24.727 --> 44:27.164
I'll meet you at the bottom
with my answer.

44:28.246 --> 44:30.044
Very well.

44:37.493 --> 44:38.875
(coughs)

44:57.430 --> 44:59.643
It's okay, Teddy.

45:00.727 --> 45:03.286
(kisses) It's okay.

45:03.287 --> 45:05.755
Mama is here.

45:07.606 --> 45:10.203
Tell-tell me about the fire in Prague.

45:12.054 --> 45:14.709
That was a long time ago.

45:14.710 --> 45:16.694
What does it matter now?

45:16.695 --> 45:19.862
I've always thought Papa started it.

45:19.863 --> 45:21.110
He did, didn't he?

45:21.111 --> 45:23.061
Eduard, you mustn't upset yourself...

45:23.062 --> 45:24.854
Mama, please.

45:24.855 --> 45:26.332
I want to know.

45:32.247 --> 45:33.589
Actually...

45:33.590 --> 45:36.246
it was my fault.

45:36.247 --> 45:38.454
And your father was the
one who put the fire out.

45:38.455 --> 45:41.142
Well, I was having

45:41.143 --> 45:44.571
my own bout of melancholy,
just like you are now.

45:49.783 --> 45:52.055
And wasn't paying attention
and one of you boys got hold

45:52.056 --> 45:53.884
of some matches.

45:56.470 --> 45:58.485
Why didn't you ever tell me the truth?

45:58.486 --> 46:01.692
I needed you to feel safe with me.

46:03.446 --> 46:05.205
You idolized your father, Eduard.

46:05.206 --> 46:07.030
But he was never there and I could see

46:07.031 --> 46:08.694
how painful that was for you.

46:08.695 --> 46:10.389
I thought it might be easier

46:10.390 --> 46:12.470
if you didn't see him as some kind

46:12.471 --> 46:14.747
of hero.

46:19.128 --> 46:21.149
Tell Papa I want to see him.

46:39.736 --> 46:42.075
Where is your father, Eduard?

46:48.791 --> 46:51.196
