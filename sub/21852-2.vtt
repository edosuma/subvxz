00:38.456 --> 00:40.166
Today we're going to have
a performance

00:40.332 --> 00:41.876
by one of our students
who has written a song.

00:42.043 --> 00:43.711
The song is about his feelings

00:43.878 --> 00:46.547
towards the current political
climate with North Korea.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.674
Put your hands together
for Tweek.

01:01.353 --> 01:03.105
We're all gonna die!

01:03.272 --> 01:07.234
They have nuclear missiles!
Aah! Aah!

01:07.401 --> 01:10.112
Why are you just sitting there
doing nothing?!

01:10.279 --> 01:11.530
we have to get out of here!

01:11.697 --> 01:13.199
North Korea
wants to kill us all

01:13.365 --> 01:15.242
and our president
keeps making it worse!

01:15.409 --> 01:18.162
Why are you all
just sitting there?!

01:18.329 --> 01:21.540
Why are you all acting
like nothing's wrong?!

01:21.707 --> 01:25.586
North Korea is going to bomb us!
We are all dead!

01:25.753 --> 01:30.049
We have to do something!
Do something! Do something!

01:33.135 --> 01:34.970
All right, next up
we have Hannah Williams

01:35.137 --> 01:36.889
with her rendition
of "Wheels on the Bus."

01:39.767 --> 01:42.895
♪ The wheels on
the bus go round and round ♪

01:45.356 --> 01:47.691
Dude, Craig, you've got to get
Tweek to get ahold of himself.

01:47.858 --> 01:49.443
He's freaking everybody out
at school.

01:49.610 --> 01:52.363
- What am I supposed to do?
- He's your boyfriend, dude.

01:52.530 --> 01:54.198
He's not
gonna listen to me.

01:54.365 --> 01:56.200
He never does
when he's emotional.

01:56.367 --> 01:57.993
Craig, let me tell you
about relationships, okay?

01:58.160 --> 02:00.287
If you don't have
some fuckin' balls,

02:00.454 --> 02:01.080
you're not going to
get anywhere.

02:01.247 --> 02:02.706
Doesn't matter if they're
gay balls or straight balls,

02:02.873 --> 02:04.834
if you don't take control
of your side of a relationship,

02:05.000 --> 02:06.961
- you'll get walked all over --
- Hey, babe. How you doing?

02:07.128 --> 02:08.504
Oh, hey, baby.
What's going on?

02:11.549 --> 02:13.801
- We still on for recess?
- Yup, I'll be there.

02:13.968 --> 02:14.969
'Kay, babe.
Love you.

02:17.346 --> 02:19.181
I thought you said
you broke up with Heidi.

02:19.348 --> 02:20.975
I decided to give her
one more chance.

02:21.142 --> 02:22.768
But you said
she was mentally abusive.

02:22.935 --> 02:24.103
She <i>is</i> mentally abusive.

02:24.270 --> 02:25.855
So then why did you
take her back?

02:26.021 --> 02:27.523
Because she said
she was gonna kill herself.

02:27.690 --> 02:29.441
All right, guys? There.

02:29.608 --> 02:30.651
I broke up with her, and she
called me, being all like,

02:30.818 --> 02:32.319
"I can't live without you.

02:32.486 --> 02:33.946
I'm scared what I'm gonna do to
myself. Oh, God."

02:34.113 --> 02:36.699
The bitch is crazy.
What am I supposed to do?

02:39.785 --> 02:40.911
Aah!

02:41.078 --> 02:43.122
Tweek.
Aah!

02:43.289 --> 02:44.915
Dude, come on.
You got to settle down.

02:45.082 --> 02:46.917
I can't settle down!
We're all gonna die!

02:47.084 --> 02:49.170
We're not all gonna die.
You're overreacting.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.463
Everything's fine, okay?

02:51.630 --> 02:53.382
Oh, God!
The president just tweeted

02:53.549 --> 02:55.676
that North Korea doesn't have
the guts to attack us!

02:55.843 --> 02:57.553
Why would he say that?!
He's making everything worse!

02:57.720 --> 02:59.096
- Tweek...
- But North Koreans are gonna think

02:59.263 --> 03:00.514
we all agree
with the president!

03:00.681 --> 03:03.767
Okay, so how about you write
your congressman a letter.

03:03.934 --> 03:06.270
That won't help anything!
North Korea wants us dead!

03:06.437 --> 03:08.147
Okay, so write a letter
to the North Koreans.

03:08.314 --> 03:09.648
I can't write in Korean

03:09.815 --> 03:11.525
and they all think
we're war-hungry anyway!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.903
Okay, well, then why don't you
just <i>send</i> something nice

03:14.069 --> 03:15.362
to the North Koreans.

03:15.529 --> 03:17.364
It'll make you feel better,
babe.

03:17.531 --> 03:19.742
- Send something like what?!
- I dunno, like,

03:19.909 --> 03:21.285
make them some
croissants or something.

03:21.452 --> 03:23.078
I don't know
how to make croissants!

03:23.245 --> 03:25.039
Well,
what <i>do</i> you know how to make?

03:25.206 --> 03:28.334
Mm...cupcakes!

03:28.500 --> 03:30.502
All right, go home
and make some cupcakes, honey.

03:30.669 --> 03:32.004
Okay!

03:33.881 --> 03:35.883
- Hey, Stan?
- Yeah?

03:36.050 --> 03:37.635
Can I talk to you
about Eric?

03:37.801 --> 03:39.345
Cartman? Okay...

03:39.511 --> 03:40.763
I just wanna make sure
he's all right.

03:40.930 --> 03:42.431
What do you mean?

03:42.598 --> 03:44.892
I don't even know if
I should be saying this but...

03:45.059 --> 03:47.728
- Eric said he was thinking about killing himself.
- What?

03:47.895 --> 03:51.148
We broke up, and he called
saying he was about to do it.

03:51.315 --> 03:53.317
I'm still
really scared for him.

03:53.484 --> 03:55.778
Wait, Cartman said
<i>he</i> was gonna kill himself?

03:55.945 --> 03:57.947
I'll send you the voicemail if
you promise to keep it private.

03:58.113 --> 03:59.365
Totally.

03:59.531 --> 04:02.868
Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.

04:03.035 --> 04:04.703
<i>You have to take me
back! You</i> have <i>to!</i>

04:04.870 --> 04:06.538
<i>I'm gonna kill myself,
Heidi!</i>

04:08.791 --> 04:10.626
<i>I'll kill myself,
and then you'll be sorry!</i>

04:10.793 --> 04:13.087
<i>You'll wish you could have me
back, but I'll be dead!</i>

04:16.006 --> 04:18.342
<i>Please, Heidi! Please!</i>

04:18.509 --> 04:20.219
Okay, okay.

04:20.386 --> 04:21.804
Really cool listening
to people's private voicemails.

04:21.971 --> 04:23.347
You sound like
a dying pig.

04:25.516 --> 04:28.185
That's great! I'm glad you guys
think suicide is so funny!

04:59.925 --> 05:01.260
Entrée.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.390
Yes, Eric.
How can I help you?

05:06.557 --> 05:08.225
I don't think
kids at this school

05:08.392 --> 05:10.644
take suicide seriously enough
and we need to raise awareness.

05:10.811 --> 05:12.396
Well,
unfortunately <i>this</i> week

05:12.563 --> 05:14.148
is Distracted Driving
Awareness Week at school,

05:14.315 --> 05:15.774
so you might have
a hard time.

05:15.941 --> 05:18.277
Distracted driving?
Who gives a shit about that?

05:18.444 --> 05:19.778
A lot of people.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.405
There's more deaths now
because of people

05:21.572 --> 05:22.823
on their phones while driving
than ever before.

05:22.990 --> 05:25.034
PC Principal,
someone's life is at stake.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.619
If I have to compete
with distracted driving,

05:27.786 --> 05:28.996
then that's what I'll do.

05:38.630 --> 05:40.841
Huh? Oh!

05:41.008 --> 05:43.302
A young homosexual boy
known only as Tweek

05:43.469 --> 05:45.512
has touched
the hearts of many

05:45.679 --> 05:48.432
by sending cupcakes
to the North Korean government.

05:48.599 --> 05:50.267
The little rascal
apparently made a dent

05:50.434 --> 05:51.935
with the North Korean dictator,

05:52.102 --> 05:54.355
who is said to have loved
the cupcakes so much

05:54.521 --> 05:56.690
that he is started
to make his own --

05:56.857 --> 05:58.609
Oh! Ahh.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.027
Huh?!

06:00.194 --> 06:02.863
"U.S. President
responds to cupcakes..."

06:03.030 --> 06:04.656
The human interest
cupcake story

06:04.823 --> 06:06.950
has apparently been heard
by the president.

06:07.117 --> 06:09.078
Just moments ago,
the president tweeted,

06:09.244 --> 06:10.412
"I know that kid Tweek.

06:10.579 --> 06:13.123
He's fucking with you,
North Korea. Get a clue.

06:13.290 --> 06:15.584
I'll bet he took a dump
in the batter."

06:15.751 --> 06:19.046
What?! Why would he say that?!

06:19.213 --> 06:20.422
Tweek, calm down.

06:20.589 --> 06:22.925
The president!
He tweeted about me!

06:23.092 --> 06:24.635
Why would he do that?!
Did you see that?!

06:24.802 --> 06:26.804
Yes, I did see that.

06:26.970 --> 06:28.931
So I went and got you something
to make things better.

06:29.098 --> 06:31.183
- What?!
- It's a fidget spinner.

06:31.350 --> 06:34.561
It's supposed to help
with anxiety. See?

06:34.728 --> 06:37.731
A fidget spinner?! Did you read
what the president tweeted?!

06:37.898 --> 06:40.567
The president of the United States

06:40.734 --> 06:42.403
just tweeted again,
this time saying --

06:42.569 --> 06:46.156
"I hope all children of America
will stand with Tweek in saying,

06:46.323 --> 06:48.492
'Go ahead and bomb us,
Kim Jong Dong,

06:48.659 --> 06:49.785
we fucking dare you!"'

06:55.165 --> 06:57.376
Hey, guys. Take a minute to read
about distracted driving?

06:57.543 --> 06:58.752
Talk to
all the grownups you know

06:58.919 --> 06:59.920
about staying off their
mobile devices

07:00.087 --> 07:01.004
when they get behind
the wheel.

07:01.171 --> 07:02.297
Hey, guys --
got a second to help

07:02.464 --> 07:03.340
stop distracted driving?

07:03.507 --> 07:04.883
- Thanks.
- Hey, guys --

07:07.136 --> 07:08.929
<i>Hey, guys,
let's a take a minute</i>

07:09.096 --> 07:10.806
<i>and talk about
suicide prevention.</i>

07:10.973 --> 07:13.016
<i>There's probably someone
right now at this school</i>

07:13.183 --> 07:15.561
<i>thinking about killing himself,
and it's not funny.</i>

07:15.727 --> 07:18.605

How's it going
with the fidget spinner?

08:41.230 --> 08:44.358
- Great!
- You seem a lot less anxious.

08:44.525 --> 08:46.235

Yet no agreement
has been reached

09:06.672 --> 09:08.257
between the parties involved.

09:08.423 --> 09:10.884
Breaking news now
out of Colorado,

09:11.051 --> 09:13.470
where the North Koreans
appear to have fired a missile

09:13.637 --> 09:15.055
over Tweek's house.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.848
Tweek, of course,
the young boy

09:17.015 --> 09:18.892
who got the attention
of Kim Jong Un last week.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.686
The news media in North Korea

09:20.852 --> 09:23.188
is calling the missile test
a victory for its people.

09:25.107 --> 09:27.818
Today the great
country of North Korea...

09:27.985 --> 09:30.821
has proven its determination
and fortitude...

09:30.988 --> 09:34.449
by successfully firing a missile
over Tweek's house.

09:34.616 --> 09:36.201
- Perhaps now Tweek...
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

09:36.368 --> 09:37.536
Why's this happening to me?!

09:37.703 --> 09:39.454
They have to know
this isn't my fault!

09:39.621 --> 09:41.665
In response
to the North Korean test,

09:41.832 --> 09:43.500
the president
of the United States

09:43.667 --> 09:45.294
has just tweeted
this statement --

09:45.460 --> 09:47.504
"You really think
Tweek is scared?

09:47.671 --> 09:50.048
Tweek will single handedly
go to North Korea

09:50.215 --> 09:52.884
and fuck all you slanty eyed
bitches doggy style.

09:53.051 --> 09:55.846
What?!
Why would he say that?!

09:56.013 --> 09:57.639
The president also tweeted --

09:57.806 --> 10:00.017
"If you even think Tweek
is worried about

10:00.183 --> 10:02.352
a bunch of dipshit poor ass
third world rice pickers,

10:02.519 --> 10:03.729
think again."

10:03.895 --> 10:06.106
Oh, my God!
What is he doing?!

10:06.273 --> 10:08.900
- Tweek, Tweek. Calm down!
- Why won't he just stop?! Why?

10:09.067 --> 10:10.944
Tweek! Tweek,
h-here's your fidget spinner!

10:11.111 --> 10:12.362
Why does he
keep making it worse?!

10:12.529 --> 10:13.780
Your fidget spinner, Tweek!
Come on, son!

10:13.947 --> 10:15.449
Aah!

10:15.616 --> 10:17.284
Focus on
the fidget spinner.

10:24.499 --> 10:27.169
Oh, geez, looks like North Korea
launched another missile.

10:27.336 --> 10:29.880
Oh, really, like another test?
Where are you looking?

10:30.047 --> 10:31.506
I'm on Drudge.

10:31.673 --> 10:33.091
You see what the president
tweeted about it?

10:33.258 --> 10:35.177
- No, what'd he say?
- The president tweeted

10:35.344 --> 10:36.553
"North Korea
is the butthole of Asia and --

10:36.720 --> 10:38.263
Innocent child!

10:38.430 --> 10:39.181
Aah!

10:39.348 --> 10:41.016
Aah!

11:04.498 --> 11:07.834
I know.
I know, it's so sad.

11:10.629 --> 11:13.548
Well, how nice.
That's a little more like it.

11:13.715 --> 11:16.051
Well, guys, what happened?
Change of heart?

11:16.218 --> 11:17.052
Yeah, you didn't hear?

11:17.219 --> 11:20.097
Gary Borkovec got ran over
by a distracted driver.

11:20.263 --> 11:22.516
What?!
Gary Borkovec? Is he dead?

11:22.683 --> 11:24.101
Yeah, dude, he's dead.

11:24.267 --> 11:25.435
Oh, that son of a bitch.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.020
I'm gonna talk
to the principal!

11:27.187 --> 11:28.647
Put down the candle,
Kenny!

11:28.814 --> 11:30.691
Like you ever gave a shit
about Gary Borkovec!

11:33.068 --> 11:35.696
<i>Entrée vous.</i>

11:35.862 --> 11:37.906
PC Principal, I'm trying to
raise suicide awareness,

11:38.073 --> 11:39.574
but everyone's preoccupied

11:39.741 --> 11:41.660
with this "don't be on your
phone when driving" crap.

11:41.827 --> 11:43.662
Gary Borkovec
was a good student.

11:43.829 --> 11:45.163
He didn't deserve
to be taken away

11:45.330 --> 11:46.665
by someone not paying attention
to the road.

11:46.832 --> 11:49.084
Yes, but Gary Borkovec
is already dead.

11:49.251 --> 11:50.919
There's nothing
we can do for him.

11:51.086 --> 11:53.088
Students need to focus on people
<i>thinking</i> about dying.

11:53.255 --> 11:55.340
I don't know
what more you want from me, bro.

11:55.507 --> 11:57.968
I can't just get people to care
with a stupid rap song.

11:58.135 --> 12:00.053
I need a full orchestra --
woodwinds, strings --

12:00.220 --> 12:01.680
I need black people
in white robes,

12:01.847 --> 12:03.098
white people
in black robes,

12:03.265 --> 12:05.475
and a thousand doves
to release into the air.

12:05.642 --> 12:10.272
I can give you two student
volunteers and one pigeon.

12:10.439 --> 12:12.899
Do you have any idea
how serious this is?

12:13.066 --> 12:14.818
As someone who deals
with suicidal thoughts,

12:14.985 --> 12:17.154
I cannot believe the lack
of concern at this school!

12:17.320 --> 12:19.197
Maybe I should just take
the awareness of my suicide

12:19.364 --> 12:20.657
out to the public
on the streets!

12:20.824 --> 12:21.992
Maybe you should.

12:22.159 --> 12:23.827
Maybe I will!

12:23.994 --> 12:26.705
- Maybe you should.
- Maybe I will!

12:32.627 --> 12:34.796
Ugh.

12:34.963 --> 12:36.089
Hey, Tweek.

12:36.256 --> 12:38.008
Look at what the president
tweeted now!

12:38.175 --> 12:39.384
What time is it, dude?

12:39.551 --> 12:41.511
Just read it!

12:41.678 --> 12:44.723
"North Korea doesn't have
the balls to attack Tweek.

12:44.890 --> 12:46.933
They have
little tiny rice balls."

12:47.100 --> 12:50.061
They're gonna get me, Craig!
Look at what's on CNN!

12:50.228 --> 12:51.813
And the President's tweets
have certainly caught

12:51.980 --> 12:53.815
the attention of North Korea,

12:53.982 --> 12:55.609
who have been spending
the past several days

12:55.776 --> 12:58.403
viewing possible targets
for a nuclear strike

12:58.570 --> 13:00.238
if war were to break out...

13:00.405 --> 13:02.532
What am I gonna do?!

13:02.699 --> 13:04.326
You gotta calm down.

13:04.493 --> 13:05.786
How am I supposed
to calm down?!

13:05.952 --> 13:07.370
North Korea is gonna get me!

13:07.537 --> 13:08.997
- They're gonna get me!
- Tweek. Tweek. Tweek.

13:09.164 --> 13:10.582
Let's think
this through logically.

13:10.749 --> 13:13.293
North Korea isn't going
to attack anyone, okay?

13:13.460 --> 13:14.711
They're not going to start
a war they can't win.

13:14.878 --> 13:15.754
Okay?

13:15.921 --> 13:17.255
- But, Craig, I --
- Tweek.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.257
You have to stop thinking
about it.

13:19.424 --> 13:21.593
Tell you what,
we're gonna go somewhere fun

13:21.760 --> 13:22.844
and make you feel better.

13:24.554 --> 13:26.598
Give a minute of your time
for suicide awareness?

13:26.765 --> 13:28.058
Suicide is serious.

13:28.225 --> 13:30.143
Help tell people like Kyle
it's not a joke.

13:30.310 --> 13:32.145
Hey, good for you guys,
trying to help.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.814
Yeah, make sure everyone
you know gets involved

13:33.980 --> 13:35.357
or else I'm gonna do it.

13:35.524 --> 13:37.067
We're getting a lot
of attention, Eric.

13:37.234 --> 13:38.819
Our website's already
full of kids

13:38.985 --> 13:39.945
saying they feel
the same way as you

13:40.111 --> 13:41.363
and want to get help.

13:41.530 --> 13:43.073
<i>They</i> want to get help?
For what?

13:43.240 --> 13:46.076
For wanting to take
their own lives.

13:46.243 --> 13:48.453
No, this is about <i>me</i>
killing myself.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.248
But, babe, there's a lot of kids
who feel the same way you do.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.208
They're full of shit,
Heidi.

13:53.375 --> 13:54.918
They're just trying
to get attention.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.546
What, are you actually talking
online to these asswipes?!

13:57.712 --> 14:00.006
I thought this was about raising
awareness and helping people.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.633
So you're just gonna e-mail

14:01.800 --> 14:02.884
with every every guy
who has a dick and a deathwish?

14:03.051 --> 14:04.302
Are we just your type?

14:04.469 --> 14:06.596
- Eric, come on.
- No, look, Heidi.

14:06.763 --> 14:08.515
I'm sorry, but you're the one
who started all this

14:08.682 --> 14:10.058
by telling everybody
that I was suicidal.

14:10.225 --> 14:11.434
Okay?

14:11.601 --> 14:13.186
Now I'm under
a lot of pressure to do it.

14:13.353 --> 14:15.146
So the only option I have
is to make sure

14:15.313 --> 14:17.315
that suicide prevention
becomes this entire town's

14:17.482 --> 14:18.859
number-one priority!

14:19.025 --> 14:20.235
Oh, God, did you see

14:20.402 --> 14:21.403
what the President said
about Asians now?

14:21.570 --> 14:22.696
Look out!

14:26.157 --> 14:28.827
Oh, are you freakin'
serious?

14:33.039 --> 14:36.543
Okay, babe,
what do you wanna ride first?

14:36.710 --> 14:38.920
Ugh!
What are we doing here, Craig?

14:39.087 --> 14:41.506
We're gonna get your mind
off politics and have some fun.

14:41.673 --> 14:43.758
Now, what's your
favorite ride?

14:43.925 --> 14:45.802
The Ferris wheel!

14:51.808 --> 14:54.769
Isn't this lovely, Tweek?
Just look at that view.

14:56.104 --> 14:57.105
Oh, God!

14:57.272 --> 14:58.398
Another tweet
from the president!

14:58.565 --> 15:00.317
Oh, come on.

15:00.483 --> 15:03.486
"Why would the U.S. be scared
of North Korea?

15:03.653 --> 15:05.780
Tweek is so not scared
he's at an amusement park

15:05.947 --> 15:06.865
in Denver right now."

15:07.032 --> 15:08.283
Jesus Christ!

15:08.450 --> 15:09.784
We gotta get outta here!

15:09.951 --> 15:11.953
Tweek!
Tweek, use your brain.

15:12.120 --> 15:14.539
North Korea isn't going
to attack an amusement park.

15:14.706 --> 15:16.166
You're safer here
than anywhere.

15:18.001 --> 15:20.211
Oh, geez.

15:20.378 --> 15:22.881
The president just called
Kim Jong-un a fat midget.

15:23.048 --> 15:24.507
Oh, and now North Korea
is saying that they're gonna --

15:24.674 --> 15:25.508
Dad, look out!

15:25.675 --> 15:26.509
Oh, shit!

15:29.930 --> 15:30.722
<i>All right, everyone,</i>

15:30.889 --> 15:32.265
<i>please wait
for your bumper cars</i>

15:32.432 --> 15:33.808
<i>to come to a complete stop.</i>

15:33.975 --> 15:35.185
<i>We hope you enjoyed
Crazy Cars --</i>

15:35.352 --> 15:38.063
Mommy, look out!

15:43.944 --> 15:45.070
Oh, my God,
what is that?!

15:45.236 --> 15:46.571
What is that?!

15:46.738 --> 15:48.990
It's probably nothing.
Everything's fine.

15:49.157 --> 15:50.742
Will you please stop
saying that?!

15:50.909 --> 15:51.993
I can't take it!

15:52.160 --> 15:53.495
I'm trying
to make you feel better.

15:53.662 --> 15:56.289
Well, maybe I don't wanna
feel better right now!

15:56.456 --> 15:57.999
Okay, but think about that.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.542
That actually doesn't make
any sense.

15:59.709 --> 16:01.419
Why do you have to be
so logical?!

16:01.586 --> 16:03.338
I don't need you
to problem-solve all the time,

16:03.505 --> 16:06.132
I need you to -- Agh!
I don't know!

16:06.299 --> 16:08.635
Tweek, honey, all week,
you've been freaking out,

16:08.802 --> 16:10.428
and I've been the one
forced to deal with it.

16:10.595 --> 16:11.972
You haven't been dealing
with it,

16:12.138 --> 16:13.640
you've been trying
to make it go away

16:13.807 --> 16:15.183
because my emotions
are freaking you out!

16:17.686 --> 16:19.938
Tweek, North Korea
isn't bombing anyone.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.439
They would lose
the support of China,

16:21.606 --> 16:22.607
- and that would be --
- There you go again!

16:22.774 --> 16:23.942
Stop preaching facts
to me!

16:24.109 --> 16:25.193
It's not what I need!

16:25.360 --> 16:27.320
Well, I'm sorry that
I'm actually in control

16:27.487 --> 16:29.280
of my goddamn emotions,
ya baby!

16:30.949 --> 16:32.742
Oh, see, now you made me lose
control of my emotions.

16:32.909 --> 16:34.077
God damn it.

16:45.046 --> 16:47.340
Hey Craig, how come
Tweek's not at school?

16:47.507 --> 16:48.550
How should I know?

16:48.717 --> 16:50.677
Uh-oh.
Trouble in paradise?

16:50.844 --> 16:53.304
Look guys, Tweek doesn't
want help, okay?

16:53.471 --> 16:55.598
He just wants to overreact.

16:55.765 --> 16:57.517
Hey, guys,
could we have your attention?

16:57.684 --> 16:59.477
Tomorrow night, we'll be having
a memorial service

16:59.644 --> 17:01.646
for all the students we've lost
to distracted driving.

17:01.813 --> 17:03.314
We hope you can all bring
your families.

17:03.481 --> 17:04.733
Cool, yeah.
Hey, guys, and there's also

17:04.899 --> 17:06.401
gonna be a suicide awareness
pot luck

17:06.568 --> 17:08.319
at 7:30 tomorrow night
in the school gymnasium.

17:08.486 --> 17:09.863
We're gonna have lots of games
and face painting,

17:10.030 --> 17:12.073
and what are you guys
gonna have?

17:12.240 --> 17:13.950
We're gonna have
some guest speakers

17:14.117 --> 17:14.951
and also provide
grievance counselors

17:15.118 --> 17:16.786
for those who need it.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.538
Yeah, grievance counseling --
that sounds super fun.

17:18.705 --> 17:19.706
Listen, guys,
there's a very real chance

17:19.873 --> 17:21.541
I might actually do it
right in front

17:21.708 --> 17:22.792
of everyone tomorrow,
so you don't want to miss it.

17:22.959 --> 17:25.003
Suicide prevention pot luck,
everybody.

17:25.170 --> 17:26.212
Eric, you need to stop.

17:26.379 --> 17:28.131
What they're doing is important.

17:28.298 --> 17:29.924
They're doing a memorial service
with speeches and crying.

17:30.091 --> 17:31.342
What's that gonna solve?

17:31.509 --> 17:32.886
it's not about
problem solving, Eric.

17:33.053 --> 17:34.345
It's about people
getting together

17:34.512 --> 17:36.639
and feeling
what they need to feel!

17:36.806 --> 17:39.017
People need help sorting out
their emotions sometimes.

17:39.184 --> 17:41.144
And the best thing
isn't always quick answers,

17:41.311 --> 17:43.104
But just being there,
supporting each other

17:43.271 --> 17:45.106
And talking through
those feelings.

17:45.273 --> 17:46.649
You are so up and down.

17:46.816 --> 17:48.401
I don't know what you want
from me, Heidi!

17:48.568 --> 17:49.569
Come on.
There has to be a way

17:49.736 --> 17:51.404
We can all work together,
here.

17:51.571 --> 17:52.906
So, now
you're on <i>their</i> side!

17:53.073 --> 17:55.325
Oh, my God, I'm seriously
gonna do it right now!

17:55.492 --> 17:56.868
Eric!

18:00.747 --> 18:02.874
Tweek!
What's going on?

18:03.041 --> 18:05.210
What? What do you mean
what's going on?!

18:05.376 --> 18:07.212
The same shit
that's been going on!

18:07.378 --> 18:08.797
Nothing's gotten
any better?!

18:08.963 --> 18:10.924
Oh, my God,
how does that make you feel?

18:11.091 --> 18:13.384
I feel scared!
I feel alone!

18:13.551 --> 18:14.928
That must be horrible
to feel that way!

18:15.095 --> 18:16.846
It must be hard for you
to even think!

18:17.013 --> 18:18.973
It is!
It's terrible!

18:19.140 --> 18:22.852
I bet it's terrible!
What else are you feeling?

18:23.019 --> 18:24.729
Like I have no control
over my life.

18:24.896 --> 18:26.815
Like I'm just a pawn
in a big game.

18:26.981 --> 18:28.358
Oh, that's a terrifying
thought.

18:28.525 --> 18:29.818
You must feel trapped.

18:29.984 --> 18:31.194
Yeah, like, trapped,

18:31.361 --> 18:32.862
But, like, completely unable
to even move.

18:33.029 --> 18:34.572
Jesus!

18:34.739 --> 18:35.990
It's like there's
no solution to any of this!

18:36.157 --> 18:37.742
What are you gonna do?
What <i>can</i> you do?

18:37.909 --> 18:40.870
I don't know.
It's -- It's like maybe --

18:41.037 --> 18:42.413
Maybe I have to find a way

18:42.580 --> 18:44.582
to feel a little in charge
of me again.

18:44.749 --> 18:46.292
That sounds
so insurmountable, though.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.169
How would you even start?

18:48.336 --> 18:51.422
I don't know, but I-I gotta do
something about this.

18:51.589 --> 18:53.550
There's gotta be
a way I can...

19:01.724 --> 19:03.518
Thank you, Craig.

19:05.562 --> 19:06.855
I've got it.

19:07.021 --> 19:08.898
