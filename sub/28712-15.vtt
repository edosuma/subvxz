WEBVTT

00:01.880 --> 00:06.680
A foreboding mountain bears
witness to astonishing events.

00:06.800 --> 00:10.930
NICK POPE: Over the years,
there has been all sorts of weirdness

00:11.060 --> 00:12.470
on this mountain.

00:12.600 --> 00:16.850
Mysterious lights,
fire in the sky.

00:16.980 --> 00:21.270
NARRATOR: Ancient stories link
it to otherworldly contact.

00:21.400 --> 00:22.530
Oh, look at that.

00:22.650 --> 00:24.780
- The spaceman?
- Spaceman, exactly.

00:24.900 --> 00:25.950
Look at the helmet.

00:26.070 --> 00:27.990
NARRATOR:
And it has become a hot spot

00:28.110 --> 00:30.450
for modern-day UFO reports.

00:30.570 --> 00:33.080
DAVID CHILDRESS:
We have extraterrestrials

00:33.200 --> 00:35.000
giving a light show for people.

00:35.120 --> 00:37.870
NARRATOR: Could this mysterious
mountain be attracting

00:38.000 --> 00:41.710
extraterrestrial visitors
to Earth?

00:41.840 --> 00:45.010
WILLIAM HENRY: The gods came
to this very specific place

00:45.130 --> 00:47.130
because of something
either in the mountain

00:47.260 --> 00:49.640
or something that was
placed there by them.

00:52.810 --> 00:54.430
NARRATOR:
There is a doorway

00:54.560 --> 00:57.270
in the universe.

00:57.390 --> 01:00.310
Beyond it is
the promise of truth.

01:01.650 --> 01:04.230
It demands
we question everything

01:04.360 --> 01:06.610
we have ever been taught.

01:06.740 --> 01:10.160
The evidence is all around us.

01:10.280 --> 01:14.080
The future is
right before our eyes.

01:14.200 --> 01:17.000
We are not alone.

01:17.120 --> 01:20.000
We have never <i>been alone.</i>

01:28.510 --> 01:29.840
NARRATOR:
Turin, Italy.

01:32.390 --> 01:36.520
Situated on the western bank
of the Po River,

01:36.640 --> 01:38.980
this city of nearly
two million people

01:39.100 --> 01:41.690
is an important
international business hub.

01:41.810 --> 01:45.570
It is also the heart of
the Italian automotive industry,

01:45.690 --> 01:47.190
with the headquarters of Fiat,

01:47.320 --> 01:51.660
Lancia and Alfa Romeo
all located here.

01:51.780 --> 01:54.200
But overlooking
this modern metropolis

01:54.330 --> 01:58.790
is Italy's most mysterious
and infamous ancient site:

01:58.910 --> 02:01.170
Mount Musinè.

02:01.290 --> 02:04.750
Rising to an elevation
of nearly 4,000 feet,

02:04.880 --> 02:08.759
Mount Musinè has stood at
a unique crossroads of history,

02:08.880 --> 02:11.720
geology and the unexplained.

02:13.010 --> 02:17.850
This is a mountain where,
over the years,

02:17.970 --> 02:21.020
almost to the beginning
of recorded human history,

02:21.140 --> 02:23.060
strange things have been seen.

02:23.190 --> 02:25.360
Lights were seen.

02:25.480 --> 02:27.820
Sometimes these lights
have been associated

02:27.940 --> 02:28.980
with the forces of good,

02:29.110 --> 02:31.240
others with the forces
of darkness.

02:31.360 --> 02:34.070
But make no mistake about it,
over the years

02:34.200 --> 02:37.410
there has been
all sorts of weirdness

02:37.530 --> 02:39.830
on this mountain.

02:39.950 --> 02:43.920
NARRATOR: Mount Musinè stands
at the easternmost edge

02:44.040 --> 02:45.830
of Italy's Susa Valley,

02:45.960 --> 02:49.920
which stretches 31 miles west
to the border of France.

02:50.050 --> 02:54.220
During the Bronze Age,
more than 3,000 years ago,

02:54.340 --> 02:57.720
this valley represented
a major crossroads,

02:57.850 --> 03:00.310
where the local Celtic people,
called the Taurini,

03:00.430 --> 03:02.140
came into contact with

03:02.270 --> 03:04.600
the most prominent civilizations
of the time.

03:06.520 --> 03:09.820
The Bronze Age Celts
of Northwestern Italy

03:09.940 --> 03:13.570
were very lucky, because
their particular location

03:13.700 --> 03:15.780
was a kind of geographical hub

03:15.910 --> 03:19.830
that had access to Northern
Europe, through the Alps,

03:19.950 --> 03:22.120
and access to the Mediterranean,
going south,

03:22.250 --> 03:25.830
and, indeed, across the
Mediterranean to Egypt.

03:25.960 --> 03:28.710
And people think
that the ancients

03:28.840 --> 03:30.960
pretty much stayed
where they were born,

03:31.090 --> 03:34.300
but many of them traveled
vast distances

03:34.430 --> 03:37.010
and encountered
many other civilizations,

03:37.140 --> 03:40.810
and absorbed some of their ideas
very willingly.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.560
NARRATOR:
The Celts in Northern Italy

03:44.690 --> 03:46.770
came into contact
with the Etruscans,

03:46.900 --> 03:49.020
the Egyptians and the Greeks.

03:49.150 --> 03:51.440
Each of these cultures
had separate

03:51.570 --> 03:54.900
but very similar
polytheistic traditions

03:55.030 --> 03:57.320
in which they worshipped
a pantheon of gods

03:57.450 --> 04:00.370
that came down to Earth
from the heavens.

04:00.490 --> 04:05.500
And they all revered Mount
Musinè as a place of power.

04:05.620 --> 04:07.880
According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

04:08.000 --> 04:12.630
Mount Musinè may in fact be
a special location on Earth

04:12.760 --> 04:16.089
because of where
it is positioned.

04:16.220 --> 04:18.890
Mount Musinè has
an amazing ancient history

04:19.010 --> 04:21.100
of magic and mystery.

04:21.220 --> 04:23.810
The significance of its position

04:23.930 --> 04:26.140
is that it's located
on a ley line,

04:26.270 --> 04:29.900
which is a gathering place
of Earth energies.

04:30.020 --> 04:34.400
NARRATOR: The concept of ley
lines originated in the 1920s

04:34.530 --> 04:38.030
with English landscape
photographer Alfred Watkins.

04:38.160 --> 04:41.280
While researching his book,
<i>The Old Straight Track,</i>

04:41.410 --> 04:43.950
Watkins made
the curious discovery

04:44.080 --> 04:46.620
that many of
the prehistoric standing stones

04:46.750 --> 04:49.750
and significant ancient sites
of England and France

04:49.880 --> 04:52.880
line up in
perfectly straight lines.

04:53.000 --> 04:56.220
And many of these sites
that these lines pass through

04:56.340 --> 04:59.680
have names that contain
the letters "L-E-Y,"

04:59.800 --> 05:02.850
like Leyland,
Keighley and Otley.

05:04.810 --> 05:08.350
Ley lines are an alignment
of ancient sites,

05:08.480 --> 05:11.020
four or more of them
over any distance.

05:11.150 --> 05:14.110
And these stretch around
the world in some cases,

05:14.230 --> 05:16.490
and these are often associated
with the same sites

05:16.610 --> 05:18.860
on the straight-line alignments.

05:18.990 --> 05:21.110
So there's a whole network
around the planet

05:21.240 --> 05:22.660
of lots of different types,

05:22.780 --> 05:24.450
some linked with
the magnetic field,

05:24.580 --> 05:27.080
others linked with
underground water

05:27.200 --> 05:30.250
and natural energies
that move through the land.

05:30.370 --> 05:32.250
NARRATOR: One of the most
significant ley lines

05:32.380 --> 05:35.380
that has been identified
is the St. Michael line.

05:35.500 --> 05:38.880
Starting from Skellig Michael
in Ireland,

05:39.010 --> 05:41.720
the seven major sites
that lie along this line

05:41.840 --> 05:45.810
each have a church dedicated
to the archangel Michael,

05:45.930 --> 05:50.190
all the way down to the Stella
Maris Monastery in Israel.

05:50.310 --> 05:52.770
And incredibly,
there is no record

05:52.900 --> 05:55.020
of the people who lived
in these separate locations

05:55.150 --> 05:57.900
having coordinated this.

05:58.030 --> 06:01.360
One of the sites the St. Michael
line passes through

06:01.490 --> 06:03.370
is Mount Musinè.

06:04.910 --> 06:08.790
You've got this straight line
of all these sites,

06:08.910 --> 06:12.620
and not just any old sites,
power sites.

06:12.750 --> 06:17.880
The ancients believed that
certain parts of the world

06:18.010 --> 06:23.140
were blessed with power, energy,

06:23.260 --> 06:27.350
that Musinè is slap-bang
on that line.

06:27.470 --> 06:30.680
NARRATOR: Is it possible that
ancient people were aware

06:30.810 --> 06:33.060
of energy emanating
from the Earth

06:33.190 --> 06:35.520
and were drawn to the area
of Mount Musinè

06:35.650 --> 06:39.110
and the Susa Valley
more than 2,000 years ago?

06:39.230 --> 06:42.860
And could these Earth energies
also be responsible

06:42.990 --> 06:44.620
for the many strange events

06:44.740 --> 06:46.700
that have been documented
in this area?

06:46.830 --> 06:48.290
(thunder crashing)

06:48.410 --> 06:51.040
Local legends passed down
from ancient times

06:51.160 --> 06:52.620
tell about this mountain

06:52.750 --> 06:56.000
being home to werewolves
and wizards.

06:56.130 --> 06:59.550
It was rumored that a dragon
guarded an enchanted cave,

06:59.670 --> 07:02.090
protecting a giant emerald.

07:02.220 --> 07:06.930
And in the fourth century AD,
the Roman Emperor Constantine

07:07.050 --> 07:09.470
claimed to have had
a vision of a cross

07:09.600 --> 07:11.930
floating in the sky
over Mount Musinè

07:12.060 --> 07:14.690
the night before
a decisive battle,

07:14.810 --> 07:17.730
one that would lead to him
seizing control of Rome

07:17.860 --> 07:20.030
from his rival, Maxentius,

07:20.150 --> 07:22.990
and converting the empire
to Christianity.

07:24.820 --> 07:26.570
POPE:
This was a pivotal moment.

07:26.700 --> 07:31.080
The adoption of Christianity
as the official religion

07:31.200 --> 07:33.080
really changed the world,

07:33.210 --> 07:36.380
and that's now a large part
of the world we live in.

07:38.170 --> 07:42.970
So did Mount Musinè have
a part in all of this?

07:43.090 --> 07:46.220
And if so, what the heck
was this encounter?

07:46.340 --> 07:50.060
GIORGIO TSOUKALOS: Now,
it was not just Constantine's vision,

07:50.180 --> 07:53.810
because it is described
that the army of Constantine

07:53.930 --> 07:56.900
also saw something
up in the sky.

07:57.020 --> 08:01.230
So the question is:
Is this one of the earliest

08:01.360 --> 08:03.820
UFO encounters
that we have on record?

08:03.940 --> 08:06.110
And in my opinion, yes, it is.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.200
NARRATOR: Could the many
extraordinary encounters

08:09.320 --> 08:12.080
recorded at Mount Musinè
throughout the ages

08:12.200 --> 08:15.620
be the product
of extraterrestrial visitation?

08:15.750 --> 08:20.210
Ancient astronaut theorists
say yes, and suggest

08:20.340 --> 08:22.130
that further evidence
can be found

08:22.250 --> 08:25.840
by examining an incredible
flurry of UFO sightings

08:25.970 --> 08:29.180
reported in much more
recent times.

08:32.470 --> 08:34.059
Northern Italy.

08:36.140 --> 08:39.059
December 2, 1973.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.360
An Alitalia flight is
17 miles outside of Turin

08:44.480 --> 08:48.360
when its pilot sees something
unusual in the night sky

08:48.490 --> 08:50.820
over the nearby Mount Musinè,

08:50.950 --> 08:53.910
something no one can identify.

08:55.410 --> 09:00.630
In 1973, an Alitalia pilot
sees a strange glow

09:00.750 --> 09:02.170
over the mountain.

09:02.290 --> 09:05.550
This is apparently
later confirmed

09:05.670 --> 09:06.880
by the control tower.

09:07.010 --> 09:09.470
NARRATOR:
According to witnesses,

09:09.590 --> 09:14.260
the glow appeared to be coming
from a mysterious round object.

09:14.390 --> 09:16.680
Two Italian Air Force planes
that were in the vicinity

09:16.810 --> 09:19.600
corroborated the sighting.

09:19.730 --> 09:22.730
The UFO report is significant
not only because

09:22.860 --> 09:26.110
it was witnessed by
multiple pilots and passengers,

09:26.230 --> 09:28.490
but because within
just a two-week period,

09:28.610 --> 09:31.950
no less than six separate
UFO incidents were reported

09:32.070 --> 09:35.080
in the vicinity of Mount Musinè.

09:35.200 --> 09:36.950
POPE:
If this was in isolation,

09:37.080 --> 09:39.750
then perhaps you could
disregard it.

09:39.870 --> 09:43.210
But when I look at Italy,

09:43.340 --> 09:46.760
and particularly this
specific part of Italy,

09:46.880 --> 09:50.430
it does seem as if
something is going on,

09:50.550 --> 09:53.510
and it seems as if
the Italian government,

09:53.640 --> 09:57.180
and maybe others, know that
there's something going on.

09:57.310 --> 10:00.810
NARRATOR: What can explain
the strange incidents

10:00.940 --> 10:03.730
that have been continuously
reported at Mount Musinè

10:03.860 --> 10:05.690
for hundreds of years?

10:05.820 --> 10:09.990
Is it possible, as ancient
astronaut theorists suggest,

10:10.110 --> 10:12.160
that extraterrestrials are drawn

10:12.280 --> 10:14.780
to this particular place
on Earth?

10:14.910 --> 10:17.160
CHILDRESS:
This light phenomenon

10:17.290 --> 10:18.830
and unusual activity
on Mount Musinè

10:18.950 --> 10:20.580
has been going on
for thousands of years,

10:20.710 --> 10:22.540
and continues to this day.

10:25.290 --> 10:27.210
POPE:
The challenge really is

10:27.340 --> 10:29.050
to find the connection,

10:29.170 --> 10:33.090
to draw together the disparate
threads of this story

10:33.220 --> 10:36.510
and say, "What is it about
this area that's so special?"

10:36.640 --> 10:39.600
NARRATOR: Perhaps further
clues can be found

10:39.720 --> 10:45.270
by investigating the strange
rock carvings found in the area,

10:45.400 --> 10:49.230
carvings that appear to be
depictions of astronauts.

10:54.450 --> 10:56.200
NARRATOR:
Val Camonica, Italy.

10:58.330 --> 11:02.210
June 13, 2019.

11:02.330 --> 11:06.080
Ancient astronaut theorist
William Henry has traveled

11:06.210 --> 11:08.750
to this UNESCO
World Heritage Site

11:08.880 --> 11:13.470
165 miles from Mount Musinè
to investigate what he believes

11:13.590 --> 11:16.800
could be forensic evidence
that the early civilizations

11:16.930 --> 11:20.890
of this region came into contact
with extraterrestrials.

11:22.520 --> 11:25.310
HENRY: Hi, I'm William.
Nice to meet you.

11:25.440 --> 11:27.770
NARRATOR: Joining him
is Luca Giarelli, the head

11:27.900 --> 11:31.820
of the Val Camonica Historical
and Anthropological Society.

11:34.110 --> 11:36.660
Luca has spent years studying
this mysterious region

11:36.780 --> 11:40.370
of Northern Italy, and wants to
show William the rock carvings

11:40.490 --> 11:43.460
for which this alpine valley
is famous.

11:45.620 --> 11:47.460
This place is massive.

11:54.090 --> 11:55.800
I'm ready. Let's go.

11:57.680 --> 11:59.680
HENRY:
I'm here at Val Camonica

11:59.800 --> 12:03.600
because it is a treasure trove
of images from the ancient world

12:03.730 --> 12:06.730
that have been well-documented
and studied by scholars.

12:06.850 --> 12:09.940
They don't agree on the meaning
of the images, but some of them

12:10.070 --> 12:13.110
are very open-minded
to the ancient astronaut theory.

12:19.620 --> 12:22.620
Footprints. Wow.

12:26.670 --> 12:28.000
They look like deer.

12:33.670 --> 12:35.670
Look at this. Incredible.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.220
Wow.

12:47.350 --> 12:48.900
HENRY:
Oh, look at that.

12:50.060 --> 12:51.360
The spaceman, exactly.

12:51.480 --> 12:52.820
Look at that helmet.

12:52.940 --> 12:55.360
Right. It's like he's glowing.

13:01.570 --> 13:02.830
HENRY:
Ah, the Camunian rose.

13:12.040 --> 13:13.170
HENRY:
Wow.

13:17.090 --> 13:18.550
19 Camunian roses?

13:20.390 --> 13:22.680
NARRATOR: Archaeologists
call this mysterious object

13:22.800 --> 13:25.770
the Camunian rose because
of its flower-like shape.

13:28.020 --> 13:30.190
While its exact meaning
is lost to history,

13:30.310 --> 13:32.400
some believe it to be
a religious symbol

13:32.520 --> 13:36.610
or a representation
of the movement of the stars.

13:36.740 --> 13:40.660
But ancient astronaut theorists
suggest it might also depict

13:40.780 --> 13:44.620
something else, the vessel that
brought these helmeted figures

13:44.740 --> 13:47.540
to Val Camonica.

13:47.660 --> 13:48.870
Look at that.
That looks like a spaceship.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.540
It's like you look up
in the sky,

13:50.670 --> 13:52.630
and you would see
this kind of twirling,

13:52.750 --> 13:54.750
spinning ship in the sky.

14:01.630 --> 14:04.970
It seems to me, just looking
at it, they're trying to talk

14:05.100 --> 14:09.230
about beings coming from other
worlds, maybe to this place.

14:11.480 --> 14:13.310
Tell me about
that five-pointed star.

14:18.280 --> 14:19.400
HENRY:
Mm-hmm.

14:26.080 --> 14:28.450
HENRY: Sometimes the-the stars
mean energy, like,

14:28.580 --> 14:30.750
energy from the stars
would come to this place

14:30.870 --> 14:33.120
where star beings
would come to this place.

14:33.250 --> 14:34.420
Yeah.

14:34.540 --> 14:35.840
Mm-hmm.

14:47.720 --> 14:50.020
Okay. This is like
a newspaper, then.

14:50.140 --> 14:54.350
It says, "This was in the sky
above us at some point,

14:54.480 --> 14:58.360
and this spaceman came down and
maybe met the Camunian people."

15:01.280 --> 15:04.410
NARRATOR: According to the ancient
stories of the Susa Valley,

15:04.530 --> 15:08.280
the city of Turin was founded by
a character from Greek mythology

15:08.410 --> 15:13.000
called Phaethon, who came
to Earth from the stars.

15:13.120 --> 15:16.960
Legend states that Turin was
founded by the god Phaethon,

15:17.090 --> 15:19.710
who is a son
of the sun god Helios.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.970
And in the myth of Phaethon,
we learn the story

15:23.090 --> 15:26.140
of how he descended to Earth
in a fiery chariot...

15:27.800 --> 15:30.180
perhaps crashing
into Mount Musinè.

15:32.810 --> 15:34.770
This also led
to something fortuitous

15:34.890 --> 15:37.310
because he brought
gifts to this place.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.360
He had great skills,
was a metallurgist,

15:41.480 --> 15:43.990
and taught this
to the local people.

15:46.320 --> 15:49.280
CHILDRESS: When we look at myths
such as the myth of Phaethon,

15:49.410 --> 15:53.830
here is really
the story of a UFO

15:53.960 --> 15:58.330
landing on a mountain
and interacting with the locals.

16:00.210 --> 16:02.300
HENRY: When we look behind
this myth of Phaethon,

16:02.420 --> 16:05.510
perhaps this is what we're also
seeing at Val Camonica.

16:05.630 --> 16:08.970
I think, given the-the
connection with the spacemen

16:09.100 --> 16:10.850
that are etched into the rock,

16:10.970 --> 16:12.520
that we have to be open
to the possibility

16:12.640 --> 16:15.390
that what the ancient artist
is trying to portray

16:15.520 --> 16:18.230
is something that he actually
saw in the sky,

16:18.350 --> 16:19.860
something coming out
of the heavens.

16:19.980 --> 16:21.570
NARRATOR:
Is there a connection

16:21.690 --> 16:24.570
between the stone carvings
found at Val Camonica

16:24.690 --> 16:28.320
and the story of Phaethon's
descent from the sky?

16:28.450 --> 16:30.200
And do other clues exist here

16:30.330 --> 16:32.580
that point
to ancient alien contact?

16:35.000 --> 16:36.160
Were there any other cultures

16:36.290 --> 16:37.370
that were connected
with the valley?

16:45.670 --> 16:47.380
- What sort of engravings?
- Uh...

16:48.800 --> 16:50.640
Mm-hmm. Oh, the horned god.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.640
Yeah. Right.

16:58.140 --> 17:00.270
HENRY:
That means the Celts were here.

17:02.320 --> 17:04.150
So, is this the only location
where we see the spaceman?

17:10.740 --> 17:11.910
- Even deeper into the woods?
- Yeah.

17:13.619 --> 17:15.619
I'd love to go. All right.

17:20.079 --> 17:23.500
NARRATOR: Luca guides William
up a steep portion of the valley

17:23.630 --> 17:26.800
for a rare look at another
carving hidden from public view.

17:31.510 --> 17:33.350
I'm all right, thanks.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.520
Wow.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.310
We're-we're, like,
on the edge of a cliff here.

17:48.820 --> 17:50.820
Wait a minute. Th-That's one of
them. Isn't it? Right there?

17:50.950 --> 17:52.660
- LUCA: Yeah.
- How cool.

17:53.780 --> 17:55.330
HENRY:
Wow.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.620
LUCA:
Like the other one.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.750
HENRY: Yeah, these are
just like the other guys.

18:01.870 --> 18:03.000
Yeah.

18:05.550 --> 18:08.130
- HENRY: The detail is amazing.
- Yeah.

18:09.510 --> 18:11.010
HENRY:
Mm-hmm.

18:14.930 --> 18:17.180
HENRY: There's clearly
some kind of an exchange

18:17.310 --> 18:18.850
that's happening here.

18:18.980 --> 18:20.810
It's like
they're making a photograph

18:20.940 --> 18:23.610
of what happened at this place.

18:23.730 --> 18:27.360
They're trying to say, "At this
spot, this is what we saw here."

18:37.660 --> 18:41.000
HENRY: Of all places to
find a rock like this.

18:41.120 --> 18:43.540
This is a very secretive,
almost initiatory place

18:43.670 --> 18:46.250
where select people
would be brought here

18:46.380 --> 18:48.840
to be told this story
about these extraterrestrials.

18:48.960 --> 18:49.880
Yeah.

18:54.640 --> 18:57.850
NARRATOR: Were the ancient people
of what is now Northwest Italy

18:57.970 --> 19:00.640
visited by beings
from other worlds?

19:00.770 --> 19:03.650
And could these depictions
of spacemen

19:03.770 --> 19:07.020
and strange craft descending
from the heavens have a link

19:07.150 --> 19:10.400
not only to the origin story
of Turin

19:10.530 --> 19:13.570
but also to the UFO sightings
that have been reported

19:13.700 --> 19:17.410
over Mount Musinè
in more recent times?

19:17.530 --> 19:20.870
Val Camonica is in this
incredible vortex, if you will,

19:21.000 --> 19:23.210
that includes Mount Musinè.

19:23.330 --> 19:25.830
We're looking at
a-an entire territory here

19:25.960 --> 19:28.420
where these extraordinary
experiences are being recorded.

19:30.710 --> 19:32.880
NARRATOR: According to
ancient astronaut theorists,

19:33.010 --> 19:35.260
the carvings at Val Camonica

19:35.390 --> 19:38.760
tell just one part
of a larger story.

19:38.890 --> 19:42.480
And they suggest that
nearby ruins may reveal not only

19:42.600 --> 19:46.560
that extraterrestrials
visited this region but why.

19:52.940 --> 19:54.400
NARRATOR:
The Susa Valley.

19:54.530 --> 19:57.530
966 AD.

19:57.660 --> 20:00.330
While ascending
Mount Pirchiriano,

20:00.450 --> 20:02.750
25 miles west of Turin,

20:02.870 --> 20:05.790
and directly across
from Mount Musinè,

20:05.920 --> 20:08.420
a Catholic bishop is startled
by an incredible sight

20:08.540 --> 20:10.920
that suddenly appears
in the sky.

20:12.880 --> 20:16.840
He sees strange lights
in the sky.

20:16.970 --> 20:21.510
And these things are described
as planks and globes

20:21.640 --> 20:23.980
made of fire,

20:24.100 --> 20:29.110
firstly appearing to be on the
mountain itself, then rising up,

20:29.230 --> 20:31.190
flying around across the sky.

20:31.320 --> 20:33.780
But they weren't just sightings.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.450
They were sightings
that had a profound consequence.

20:37.570 --> 20:42.700
These strange sightings
prompted the bishop to say,

20:42.830 --> 20:46.620
"This will be the site on which
we will build the new abbey,"

20:46.750 --> 20:51.420
that came to be known
as Sacra di San Michele.

20:51.540 --> 20:53.420
CHILDRESS:
So once again, we have

20:53.550 --> 20:56.420
what seems to be
extraterrestrials

20:56.550 --> 20:58.840
giving a light show for people,

20:58.970 --> 21:02.050
uh, wanting to attract
their attention

21:02.180 --> 21:05.730
and perhaps inspiring them
to-to do certain things.

21:05.850 --> 21:09.650
NARRATOR: The Sacra di San
Michele, or Saint Michael's Abbey,

21:09.770 --> 21:13.190
still stands atop
Mount Pirchiriano today.

21:13.320 --> 21:15.360
It is to this sacred abbey

21:15.490 --> 21:18.400
that ancient astronaut theorist
William Henry is headed

21:18.530 --> 21:22.530
with author and historian
Gnomo Orzo, who plans to reveal

21:22.660 --> 21:25.120
a historic secret.

21:30.750 --> 21:32.710
- Wow.
- Oh, my gosh. Look at this.

21:32.840 --> 21:34.710
- Yes. Susa Valley.
- Wow.

21:34.840 --> 21:36.840
Wow, wow, wow.

21:36.960 --> 21:39.010
- Look.
- That's incredible.

21:43.550 --> 21:45.890
- HENRY: Musinè.
- ORZO: Yeah.

21:46.020 --> 21:49.640
It's like Musinè and the Sacra
are-are twin peaks.

21:49.770 --> 21:50.730
- ORZO: Yes.
- HENRY: Incredible.

22:05.830 --> 22:08.700
And in this place
where the Sacra was built,

22:08.830 --> 22:09.910
we have some other
interesting phenomenon...

22:35.060 --> 22:37.730
NARRATOR:
According to ancient stories,

22:37.860 --> 22:40.150
in this area of
the St. Michael line,

22:40.280 --> 22:42.450
the energy line, or ley line,

22:42.570 --> 22:45.160
that many believe runs
straight through Italy,

22:45.280 --> 22:50.450
a highly advanced civilization
existed thousands of years ago,

22:50.580 --> 22:53.920
a civilization that began
when the god Phaethon

22:54.040 --> 22:58.050
came down from the sky
in his fiery chariot.

22:58.170 --> 23:01.840
The local accounts of Phaethon
not only connect this figure

23:01.970 --> 23:06.260
with the ancient Greeks
but also the ancient Egyptians.

23:06.390 --> 23:08.890
And some ancient astronaut
theorists suggest

23:09.020 --> 23:11.180
that as a bringer of technology,

23:11.310 --> 23:14.270
Phaethon could be the same
extraterrestrial being

23:14.400 --> 23:16.810
that was known in Egypt as Ptah.

23:18.690 --> 23:20.480
HENRY:
Their names are very similar,

23:20.610 --> 23:22.780
Ptah and Phaethon.

23:22.900 --> 23:25.870
The legend says
that Phaethon founded Turin

23:25.990 --> 23:28.620
in honor of the Apis bull.

23:28.740 --> 23:32.290
Turin, or Turino, is called
the city of the bull.

23:32.410 --> 23:35.370
Now, this is very interesting
because in ancient Egypt,

23:35.500 --> 23:39.550
where the reverence
for the Apis bull originated,

23:39.670 --> 23:41.710
we're told that the Apis bull,

23:41.840 --> 23:45.340
or Apis bull, was actually
the Egyptian god of technology,

23:45.470 --> 23:48.180
Ptah, incarnate.

23:48.300 --> 23:53.680
Ptah was the Egyptian god
of smithcraft and alchemy.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.360
So we have to ask the question:

23:57.480 --> 24:01.230
Is Musinè a place that was known
in the ancient world,

24:01.360 --> 24:03.280
where the secrets of alchemy

24:03.400 --> 24:06.700
were ultimately going to be
stored or could be accessed?

24:06.820 --> 24:09.620
There seems to be
a very important connection

24:09.740 --> 24:11.830
between the cosmic knowledge
of metallurgy,

24:11.950 --> 24:15.540
which was brought to Earth
by the gods,

24:15.670 --> 24:18.540
and some kind of energy
present at Mount Musinè.

24:20.960 --> 24:24.510
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials'
knowledge of metallurgy and alchemy

24:24.630 --> 24:26.630
was used to create
a technologically advanced

24:26.760 --> 24:31.260
ancient city around
Mount Musinè, where did it go?

24:31.390 --> 24:33.520
In the first century BC,

24:33.640 --> 24:37.060
Rome conquered the area's
original inhabitants

24:37.190 --> 24:40.020
and established
Augusta Taurinorum,

24:40.150 --> 24:43.360
the colony that
eventually became Turin.

24:43.480 --> 24:46.650
All traces of the people
and city that came before it

24:46.780 --> 24:48.660
seem to have vanished.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.160
HENRY: So the Roman Empire came
here and said, "We're gonna take

24:54.290 --> 24:56.120
your knowledge and secrets,
we're gonna weaponize..."

24:56.250 --> 24:57.370
Yeah, of course.

25:07.680 --> 25:09.430
So the energy is still here
in this valley.

25:26.190 --> 25:27.780
- All right, let's go.
- Yeah.

25:29.360 --> 25:31.280
NARRATOR:
Gnomo and William head next

25:31.410 --> 25:34.870
to a hill near the village
of Mompantero.

25:34.990 --> 25:37.910
If extraterrestrials handed
knowledge of advanced technology

25:38.040 --> 25:40.750
to the ancient people
of this region,

25:40.880 --> 25:43.630
Gnomo believes it happened here,

25:43.750 --> 25:45.590
and he has located evidence
to prove it.

25:45.710 --> 25:46.800
Look at that.

25:54.890 --> 25:56.270
So...

26:05.070 --> 26:07.070
Right, so this is knowledge
way beyond

26:07.190 --> 26:09.150
what we normally think of the

26:09.280 --> 26:11.740
- neolithic mind being able to grasp.
- Yeah.

26:26.800 --> 26:28.630
BRUCE FENTON:
Finding this triple spiral

26:28.760 --> 26:31.010
at Musinè
is absolutely fascinating.

26:31.130 --> 26:34.140
I suspect that
among its many meanings,

26:34.260 --> 26:36.180
which... most of which
have to do with movement

26:36.310 --> 26:38.680
and energetic flow,
I suspect amongst these

26:38.810 --> 26:41.480
we're also being told something
about Earth energies.

26:41.600 --> 26:45.770
They had a knowledge
of these magnetic forces

26:45.900 --> 26:47.860
and these energies, you know,
something that they perhaps

26:47.980 --> 26:51.280
should not have known
but clearly did.

26:51.400 --> 26:54.780
NARRATOR: Is it possible that the
ancient people of the Susa Valley

26:54.910 --> 26:57.490
received knowledge
of Earth's magnetic forces

26:57.620 --> 26:59.620
from extraterrestrials
that were present

26:59.750 --> 27:01.870
in the region of Mount Musinè?

27:02.000 --> 27:04.830
But if a technologically
advanced city

27:04.960 --> 27:08.000
really did once exist
in the Susa Valley,

27:08.130 --> 27:12.050
how is it that all evidence
of it disappeared?

27:12.170 --> 27:15.680
Some researchers say
remnants of this lost city

27:15.800 --> 27:17.850
can still be found

27:17.970 --> 27:20.390
in the shadow of Mount Musinè.

27:26.860 --> 27:29.440
NARRATOR: Deeper in the
Susa Valley of Northern Italy,

27:29.570 --> 27:32.740
Gnomo Orzo takes William Henry

27:32.860 --> 27:36.950
to a Roman archaeological site
called Il Maometto.

27:37.070 --> 27:39.410
But what he wants to show him

27:39.540 --> 27:42.080
is something hidden
in the woods nearby

27:42.200 --> 27:46.330
that predates even the earliest
identified Roman ruins.

27:46.460 --> 27:50.210
HENRY:
Wow, Gnomo. Look at this.

27:53.010 --> 27:54.970
Look at this

27:55.090 --> 27:58.300
incredible, incredible platform.

27:58.430 --> 28:00.220
Yeah, huge wheels,

28:00.350 --> 28:04.980
uh, surrounded by a lot
of very ancient walls.

28:05.100 --> 28:08.110
HENRY: You know, I've seen
something like this before in Egypt,

28:08.230 --> 28:09.570
at Abu Gorab,

28:09.690 --> 28:12.150
wheels just like this
on this massive platform.

28:12.280 --> 28:16.570
Quartz crystal embedded.
It's like a landing platform.

28:16.700 --> 28:18.120
ORZO:
Yeah.

28:18.240 --> 28:21.330
NARRATOR: Approximately
ten miles south of Cairo,

28:21.450 --> 28:23.790
the ancient site of Abu Gorab

28:23.910 --> 28:27.710
contains massive circular
alabaster platforms.

28:27.830 --> 28:30.500
Local tradition holds
that this site

28:30.630 --> 28:34.010
is one of the oldest
ceremonial centers on the planet

28:34.130 --> 28:37.760
and that the alabaster platforms
created a harmonic resonance

28:37.890 --> 28:40.550
through sound vibrations
to open the senses

28:40.680 --> 28:43.890
to communicate
with divine energies.

28:44.020 --> 28:48.520
When I came upon this platform
in the middle of this forest,

28:48.650 --> 28:50.110
it took me back to Egypt

28:50.230 --> 28:52.360
where you see massive
stone altars like this,

28:52.480 --> 28:54.820
for example, at Abu Gorab,

28:54.940 --> 28:58.910
that have exactly the same
stone wheels in the center,

28:59.030 --> 29:01.990
and I'm thinking, this proves
the Egyptian connection, too.

29:02.120 --> 29:04.910
This is a-a common
symbolic element

29:05.040 --> 29:07.540
that almost always connects
with extraterrestrials.

29:07.670 --> 29:09.830
NARRATOR:
For William Henry,

29:09.960 --> 29:13.550
the wheels also present
another intriguing possibility.

29:13.670 --> 29:16.840
He believes that they may have
been made to commemorate

29:16.970 --> 29:20.140
the foundational story
of the city of Turin,

29:20.260 --> 29:22.510
in which it is said
that an otherworldly being

29:22.640 --> 29:24.060
called Phaethon

29:24.180 --> 29:28.060
descended from the sky
in a fiery chariot.

29:28.190 --> 29:31.230
In the story, the craft
in which he descends to Earth

29:31.360 --> 29:34.020
is described as having wheels,

29:34.150 --> 29:36.400
but it is also said
that he brought with him

29:36.530 --> 29:39.410
so-called "wheels of knowledge."

29:39.530 --> 29:41.990
The myth tells us that there was

29:42.120 --> 29:44.830
some kind of a craft
that came into this area,

29:44.950 --> 29:48.210
and they describe wheels
that Phaethon left,

29:48.330 --> 29:50.210
wheels of knowledge.

29:50.330 --> 29:51.920
Is that what we have here?

29:52.040 --> 29:56.630
Wheels that match what we saw
with the spirals on the rock

29:56.760 --> 29:58.300
of this extraordinary knowledge

29:58.420 --> 30:01.220
encoding the secrets
of light itself.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.470
- It's an incredible mystery.
- It's the incredible mystery.

30:03.600 --> 30:08.430
Right away I think of the golden
wheels of the-the solar discs

30:08.560 --> 30:10.640
in the Aztec and Inca cultures.

30:10.770 --> 30:14.860
We know that
they were great circles,

30:14.980 --> 30:17.070
and that on them
would be engraved

30:17.190 --> 30:19.240
all sorts of knowledge,
all sorts of information,

30:19.360 --> 30:22.110
astronomy, and other
mythology being coded

30:22.240 --> 30:23.870
into the surface of the disc.

30:23.990 --> 30:26.410
Now, could it be that
at Musinè we have

30:26.540 --> 30:28.160
exactly the same thing
happening,

30:28.290 --> 30:30.660
that we have
this great golden wheel

30:30.790 --> 30:33.170
upon which is
all of this information?

30:33.290 --> 30:37.380
NARRATOR: Might the ancient wheels
carved into the rock at Il Maometto

30:37.500 --> 30:40.920
be just the tip
of an historical iceberg?

30:41.050 --> 30:45.800
A sign of the lost ancient city
buried beneath the ground?

30:45.930 --> 30:48.060
We enter into this valley where,

30:48.180 --> 30:49.930
what do we find,
these ancient myths

30:50.060 --> 30:51.940
of a civilization

30:52.060 --> 30:54.520
that might have had
some extraordinary knowledge

30:54.650 --> 30:56.690
that they're trying to protect,

30:56.820 --> 30:59.030
and we come into here
and look at these walls,

30:59.150 --> 31:00.820
more ancient than ancient Rome.

31:09.910 --> 31:10.910
Yeah.

31:11.040 --> 31:14.000
HENRY:
We've seen Val Camonica

31:14.120 --> 31:17.380
with these incredible depictions
of spacemen on the rocks.

31:17.500 --> 31:21.970
Thousands of years old.
Absolutely amazing.

31:22.090 --> 31:25.640
Then we come through
the gates of Musinè,

31:25.760 --> 31:27.680
where Constantine saw
this flash of light,

31:27.810 --> 31:29.470
the heavens open.

31:29.600 --> 31:33.890
And across the valley
we have Sacra San Michele,

31:34.020 --> 31:36.190
where the monk saw
the light as well.

31:36.310 --> 31:39.020
Extraordinary complex there.

31:39.150 --> 31:41.860
It's telling us that there was
contact in the ancient world

31:41.990 --> 31:43.610
at this place.

31:43.740 --> 31:46.740
For some reason people have been
coming into this valley.

31:46.870 --> 31:48.580
They're attracted
by something here,

31:48.700 --> 31:52.450
for a very long time,
and talking about

31:52.580 --> 31:53.830
these amazing mysteries
and knowledge.

31:53.960 --> 31:55.290
Yeah, like...

32:07.430 --> 32:09.010
There is so much more here
to investigate

32:09.140 --> 32:10.760
than I ever imagined.

32:10.890 --> 32:15.890
NARRATOR: Ancient visitors
sharing the secrets of metallurgy?

32:16.020 --> 32:17.980
Tales of a lost civilization

32:18.110 --> 32:21.280
that once held
advanced knowledge?

32:21.400 --> 32:26.240
And ruins still waiting to be
identified in the Susa Valley?

32:26.360 --> 32:30.490
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

32:30.620 --> 32:34.160
the area of Mount Musinè
provides overwhelming evidence

32:34.290 --> 32:38.130
that extraterrestrials were
once present here.

32:38.250 --> 32:41.550
But if these otherworldly
visitors helped to establish

32:41.670 --> 32:45.380
a technologically advanced
civilization in the Susa Valley,

32:45.510 --> 32:47.220
what happened to it?

32:47.340 --> 32:50.850
Ancient astronaut theorists
suggest further clues

32:50.970 --> 32:53.770
might be found by examining
strange encounters

32:53.890 --> 32:55.600
that have occurred
on Mount Musinè

32:55.730 --> 32:58.350
in more recent times.

32:58.480 --> 33:00.610
And they point
to the possibility

33:00.730 --> 33:03.400
that the lost city still exists.

33:09.660 --> 33:13.450
NARRATOR:
Northern Italy, 1933.

33:15.580 --> 33:18.080
With the threat of war
casting an ominous shadow

33:18.210 --> 33:19.710
across Europe,

33:19.830 --> 33:22.630
an incredible series
of events unfolds,

33:22.750 --> 33:25.340
all under the supervision
of one of history's

33:25.460 --> 33:28.300
most powerful
and feared leaders,

33:28.430 --> 33:31.720
Benito Mussolini.

33:31.850 --> 33:36.810
In 1933, it's claimed
that a UFO crashed

33:36.930 --> 33:39.440
in the Lombardy region of Italy.

33:39.560 --> 33:44.480
This was apparently an object
around 50 feet in diameter,

33:44.610 --> 33:47.950
like two saucers
joined together.

33:48.070 --> 33:52.490
It was described as being
grayish in color, and metallic.

33:52.620 --> 33:56.540
And apparently it was then taken
by the military

33:56.660 --> 33:59.620
and studied
on the personal orders

33:59.750 --> 34:03.460
of the then-dictator
Benito Mussolini.

34:05.500 --> 34:08.340
NARRATOR: According to some
accounts, the UFO crashed

34:08.469 --> 34:10.130
near the city of Magenta,

34:10.260 --> 34:13.639
just 80 miles northeast
of Mount Musinè.

34:13.760 --> 34:16.850
The craft was found
to be unoccupied,

34:16.969 --> 34:21.020
and unlocking its secrets
became a top priority.

34:22.810 --> 34:26.480
This flying saucer was something
that the Mussolini government

34:26.610 --> 34:28.400
took a lot of interest in.

34:28.530 --> 34:31.530
And so there was
an establishment

34:31.659 --> 34:35.780
of a group of experts
to study this phenomenon.

34:35.909 --> 34:38.449
To study exactly
what it involved, who made it.

34:38.580 --> 34:43.380
And this committee
was called RS/33.

34:43.500 --> 34:46.250
NARRATOR: To lead the
committee, it is said that

34:46.380 --> 34:48.710
Mussolini enlisted
the noted engineer

34:48.840 --> 34:53.340
and famed inventor
of the radio, Guglielmo Marconi.

34:53.469 --> 34:55.679
Mussolini said,
"Find out what it is,

34:55.800 --> 34:58.350
and because it seems to be
so advanced, build one."

34:58.470 --> 35:01.180
And Marconi apparently said,
"Well, we can't.

35:01.310 --> 35:03.100
"We can't figure it out.

35:03.230 --> 35:06.060
"There is a technology here
over and above

35:06.190 --> 35:08.480
anything we possess."

35:08.610 --> 35:13.240
And that only left
the conclusion that this,

35:13.360 --> 35:14.910
for want of a better term, was

35:15.030 --> 35:17.370
an extraterrestrial spacecraft.

35:19.910 --> 35:23.080
NARRATOR: Was a crashed
extraterrestrial craft really recovered

35:23.210 --> 35:26.380
by the Italian government
in 1933?

35:27.750 --> 35:30.340
And if so,
is it merely coincidence

35:30.460 --> 35:33.760
that it happened so close
to Mount Musinè?

35:33.880 --> 35:37.260
Let's just suppose
that the common thread here

35:37.390 --> 35:39.770
is actually Earth energies...

35:40.970 --> 35:43.560
which the UFOs know about

35:43.690 --> 35:46.560
and use, perhaps,

35:46.690 --> 35:49.400
to draw the energy
that they need.

35:49.520 --> 35:54.110
So, might we be dealing
with not just visitation

35:54.240 --> 35:57.070
but a more permanent facility?

35:57.200 --> 35:59.700
MARTELL: So, when we look
at Mount Musinè and this energy,

35:59.830 --> 36:01.160
we wonder if there isn't
something happening

36:01.290 --> 36:02.910
below ground as well.

36:03.040 --> 36:05.290
Could this be a location
of some type of secret base?

36:07.130 --> 36:09.250
NARRATOR:
A secret alien base?

36:09.380 --> 36:12.710
Could this be the reason why
so many strange events

36:12.840 --> 36:15.930
have been reported
in this area for centuries?

36:16.050 --> 36:18.140
And might it also explain
what happened

36:18.260 --> 36:20.100
to the lost city?

36:20.220 --> 36:24.390
Does it still exist
inside the mountain?

36:24.520 --> 36:27.900
As far as ancient astronaut
theorists are concerned,

36:28.020 --> 36:31.270
the most compelling
evidence of all may be found

36:31.400 --> 36:33.400
by examining an incident
that happened

36:33.530 --> 36:36.780
not above Mount Musinè
but on its slopes.

36:39.240 --> 36:42.870
December 8, 1978.

36:42.990 --> 36:45.620
Two hikers are on Mount Musinè

36:45.750 --> 36:48.250
when they witness a strong
and blinding light

36:48.380 --> 36:50.960
that seems to envelop
the mountain summit.

36:51.090 --> 36:54.550
Curious, one of the men
approaches the light

36:54.670 --> 36:58.390
and vanishes into thin air.

36:58.510 --> 37:00.680
When he turns up again,

37:00.800 --> 37:05.810
he is dazed, confused,
he's apparently in shock.

37:05.930 --> 37:08.190
He has a scalded leg.

37:08.310 --> 37:11.770
And when he comes around,
he relays this account

37:11.900 --> 37:16.360
of how he was taken on board
this craft.

37:18.280 --> 37:21.280
NARRATOR: Immediately following
this terrifying ordeal,

37:21.410 --> 37:23.370
both hikers come down
with a sever case

37:23.490 --> 37:26.830
of conjunctivitis,
an inflammation or infection

37:26.960 --> 37:29.120
of the membrane
that lines the eyelid

37:29.250 --> 37:31.500
and covers the whites
of the eyes.

37:31.630 --> 37:37.050
So it would seem that they were
in contact with some kind

37:37.170 --> 37:39.470
of radiation that ultimately
affected their health,

37:39.590 --> 37:41.220
in a sense.

37:41.340 --> 37:44.560
And this is a story that occurs
over and over again

37:44.680 --> 37:46.600
in UFO lore.

37:46.730 --> 37:50.770
POPE: When we look at this incident
and some of the previous ones,

37:50.900 --> 37:52.270
what are the themes?

37:52.400 --> 37:55.360
Fire in the sky.
Energy.

37:55.480 --> 37:58.200
Scalding. Burning.

37:58.320 --> 38:00.700
It's all about power.

38:00.820 --> 38:04.830
Are these sightings being caused
because there are, perhaps,

38:04.950 --> 38:07.750
underground facilities, bases?

38:07.870 --> 38:11.540
And if that's true,
maybe it's not just one base

38:11.670 --> 38:15.250
but a network of bases
in that area.

38:17.050 --> 38:19.220
NARRATOR: If extraterrestrials
have remained on Earth

38:19.340 --> 38:21.180
for thousands of years,

38:21.300 --> 38:23.680
secretly operating from bases

38:23.800 --> 38:26.390
hidden throughout Italy's
Susa Valley,

38:26.520 --> 38:28.560
why haven't they left?

38:28.680 --> 38:32.400
Ancient astronaut theorists
believe that the most recent

38:32.520 --> 38:35.320
activity to be reported
on Mount Musinè may suggest

38:35.440 --> 38:39.240
that the answer
will soon be revealed.

38:46.030 --> 38:50.120
Corio, Italy, 20 miles north
of Mount Musinè.

38:50.250 --> 38:54.750
June 6, 2018.

38:54.880 --> 38:58.920
At 11:00 p.m., the residents
of this small town

38:59.050 --> 39:03.260
are startled by the sight
of two F-16 fighter jets.

39:03.390 --> 39:06.720
They appear to be in pursuit
of a giant orb of light

39:06.850 --> 39:10.230
passing rapidly overhead
in the night sky.

39:10.350 --> 39:13.190
Government officials
later claim that the object

39:13.310 --> 39:15.400
was nothing more than a drone.

39:15.520 --> 39:18.440
But the local townspeople
who witnessed the craft

39:18.570 --> 39:22.570
claimed that it appeared to be
nearly 200 feet in diameter,

39:22.700 --> 39:26.070
and that the low-flying jets
were chasing the object

39:26.200 --> 39:30.830
at such extreme velocity,
it shook their windows.

39:30.950 --> 39:35.290
POPE: So, again,
this sighting has to be fit in

39:35.420 --> 39:37.540
with all these other pieces
of the puzzle.

39:37.670 --> 39:40.630
All these other sightings
over the years

39:40.760 --> 39:42.720
in this exact same area,

39:42.840 --> 39:45.970
right back from the day
of Constantine

39:46.090 --> 39:50.770
through to the Italian Air Force
chasing UFOs.

39:50.890 --> 39:53.350
Of all the hundreds
of UFO conferences

39:53.480 --> 39:55.270
I've attended over the years,

39:55.400 --> 39:58.570
I've only ever once been to one

39:58.690 --> 40:01.820
where a delegation
of military officers

40:01.940 --> 40:04.950
have arrived in uniform

40:05.070 --> 40:07.620
and actually given
a presentation.

40:07.740 --> 40:11.200
That conference took place
in San Marino,

40:11.330 --> 40:14.210
and the officers were
from the Italian Air Force.

40:14.330 --> 40:18.920
There's something about
this area that's important,

40:19.040 --> 40:22.170
but we don't know
what it is yet.

40:25.130 --> 40:27.640
When we try to come
to a conclusion or a summation

40:27.760 --> 40:31.010
about what is going on in Italy,

40:31.140 --> 40:34.520
going back from prehistoric
times to modern times,

40:34.640 --> 40:39.110
the common element is: The gods
came to this very specific place

40:39.230 --> 40:42.230
because of something
at Mount Musinè.

40:42.360 --> 40:43.990
Something either in the mountain

40:44.110 --> 40:46.700
or something that was
placed there by them.

40:46.820 --> 40:50.160
NARRATOR: Some ancient
astronaut theorists believe

40:50.280 --> 40:52.490
that it is not just
Mount Musinè,

40:52.620 --> 40:55.000
but also Mount Pirchiriano,

40:55.120 --> 40:57.830
where the Sacra di San Michele
was erected,

40:57.960 --> 41:00.670
and other peaks throughout
the Italian Alps

41:00.790 --> 41:04.090
that are hiding secret
alien bases.

41:04.210 --> 41:08.970
CHILDRESS: Perhaps these mountains
are like outposts or embassies

41:09.090 --> 41:11.300
where the extraterrestrials
are active,

41:11.430 --> 41:12.970
they have their technology.

41:13.100 --> 41:15.140
Craft are coming and going

41:15.270 --> 41:18.270
from these secret
mountain bases.

41:18.400 --> 41:20.940
And part of their agenda is
to contact people,

41:21.060 --> 41:23.110
to influence them.

41:23.230 --> 41:26.700
So this is, perhaps,
what these mountains are about.

41:26.820 --> 41:30.120
This is why these incredible
legends and myths

41:30.240 --> 41:32.330
are associated with them.

41:32.450 --> 41:35.540
NARRATOR: Have extraterrestrials
been hiding out in the mountains

41:35.660 --> 41:38.500
of Northern Italy for hundreds

41:38.620 --> 41:41.920
and perhaps even thousands
of years?

41:42.040 --> 41:45.880
Is this the location
of an alien embassy on Earth,

41:46.010 --> 41:47.760
known to high ranking
government officials

41:47.880 --> 41:49.970
throughout the world?

41:50.090 --> 41:53.600
Perhaps the mysterious carvings
found in Val Camonica

41:53.720 --> 41:57.020
represent not only visitors
who came to Earth

41:57.140 --> 41:58.770
in the distant past,

41:58.890 --> 42:00.730
but who are still here,

42:00.850 --> 42:04.730
preparing to reconnect
with humanity once again.
