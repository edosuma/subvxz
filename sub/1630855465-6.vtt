Heads up, furbag!

00:13.471 --> 00:14.556
[Sonic groans]

00:14.639 --> 00:17.016
Is that a... knockoff me?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.394
Knockoff? Oof, that stings!

00:19.477 --> 00:22.022
From the top
of my titanium reinforced head

00:22.105 --> 00:24.190
to my industrial-grade tookus!

00:24.274 --> 00:27.861
[yells, groans]

00:27.944 --> 00:29.237
Woah, woah, woah!

00:29.320 --> 00:32.532
The name is Chaos Sonic,
like regular Sonic

00:32.615 --> 00:35.577
but with twice the charm,
and none of the failure!

00:35.660 --> 00:39.080
Failure?
You've got the wrong hedgehog, pal!

00:39.164 --> 00:44.127
Au contraire, blue-hair!
I know a fox that might disagree with you.

00:44.210 --> 00:47.255
Another trap... I knew that fox
would set us up!

00:47.338 --> 00:48.590
That's a lie!

00:48.673 --> 00:51.176
I was not programmed to lie!

[Dr. Done It laughing]

01:24.876 --> 01:27.045
[Dr. Done It]
The seed from which our empire

01:27.128 --> 01:29.339
will someday bloom.

01:31.758 --> 01:34.302
[both slurp, exhale]

01:34.385 --> 01:37.889
Now, first things first...

01:37.972 --> 01:39.224
[clears throat]

01:39.307 --> 01:42.894
As Mayor, President,
Chief Superintendent, High Chancellor--

01:42.977 --> 01:44.229
[spits]

01:44.312 --> 01:46.523
Who died and made you Emperor Egg?

01:46.606 --> 01:48.733
No one. Yet.

01:48.817 --> 01:52.070
But since we can all agree
he's too old for the job--

01:52.153 --> 01:55.907
[scoffs] Too old? [mumbles] Horsefeathers!

01:55.990 --> 01:57.450
-Not so fast!

Or you really will be ancient history.

02:00.328 --> 02:03.873
I oughta teach you
to respect your elders-- [coughs]

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
Ugh. See? My point exactly.

02:06.793 --> 02:09.546
All in favor of me ruling the city,
say aye.

02:09.629 --> 02:12.590
And let you doom us to mediocrity? Hardly.

02:12.674 --> 02:15.009
Leadership requires vision--

02:15.093 --> 02:16.803
Guess that rules you out.

02:16.886 --> 02:18.721
You think you could run a city?

02:18.805 --> 02:19.973
Better than you.

02:20.056 --> 02:21.558
-Why you--

[mockingly]
"You can't even run the dishwasher."

02:29.566 --> 02:31.693
-That's what you sound like.
-[gasps]

02:31.776 --> 02:33.695
Don't you take that tone with me!

02:33.778 --> 02:35.905
You're not my dad!

02:35.989 --> 02:38.074
Yeah, don't tell us what to do!

[unintelligible monologue]

02:47.125 --> 02:51.171
Oh, you mean... divide the city?

02:51.254 --> 02:54.883
Five sectors. One for each of us.

02:54.966 --> 02:56.509
The baby has a point.

02:56.593 --> 03:00.763
Surely a council of equals
is preferable to total chaos?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.473
[babbles]

03:02.557 --> 03:06.686
[Dr. Done It]
Conquer then divide? So be it.

03:14.986 --> 03:18.656
No! Nine wouldn't do that!
[groans, yelps]

03:23.328 --> 03:24.954
Hi-yah!

03:25.038 --> 03:27.582
Hi-- Oh! [groans]

03:28.917 --> 03:30.585
I've gotta get Nine out of there!

03:30.668 --> 03:34.464
Forget that two-timing punk!
Get in, get the shards, get out!

03:34.547 --> 03:37.342
-That's it!
-Some of us are fast enough-- Ow!

03:38.217 --> 03:39.135
[groans]

03:41.638 --> 03:44.807
Wow, looking at you is like looking
in a mirror!

03:44.891 --> 03:47.435
[mockingly] Only I'm all sad and pathetic!

03:47.518 --> 03:49.604
You're gonna be sad in a minute!

03:55.818 --> 03:57.445
Ugh, I can't take it!

03:57.528 --> 03:59.656
You're just so tragic and smelly!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.282
Here, let me help.

04:01.366 --> 04:05.203
[groaning] Please, stop talking.

04:05.286 --> 04:06.788
Ah!

04:06.871 --> 04:09.165
Gotcha! Saved your life.

04:09.249 --> 04:14.003
[Sonic] Woah!

04:14.087 --> 04:17.757
-Have I told you my three-step plan yet?
-[Sonic gasping for air]

04:17.840 --> 04:20.426
-Oh, you're gonna love it.
-Hey!

04:20.510 --> 04:24.389
Step 1, beat you to a pulp, obviously.
Step 2, rebrand!

04:24.472 --> 04:27.642
Ugh, this guy just won't stop talking.

04:27.725 --> 04:29.352
[Sonic spin noise]

04:29.477 --> 04:32.522
First of all, stop talking! And second--

04:32.605 --> 04:35.942
Ah, ah, ah! You didn't hear my step three.

04:36.025 --> 04:40.280

-Nice one.
-That the last of 'em?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.172
Better be.

[Rebel Rouge]
Sonic looks like he could use a hand.

Help Sonic!

05:11.644 --> 05:15.106
-I'll hold them off as long as I can.
-I ain't leaving you.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.650
Yes, you are. That's an order.

05:17.734 --> 05:18.776
Go!

05:18.860 --> 05:23.489
[lasers shooting]

05:25.950 --> 05:30.038
What's the matter? Stage fright?
Don't worry. The show's almost over,

05:30.121 --> 05:33.791
and you've had a good run,
but it's time to take your final bow.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.626
[crashes]

05:35.710 --> 05:37.086
Aw, yeah!

05:37.170 --> 05:39.213
I think you're getting rusty, Blue.

05:39.297 --> 05:40.757
This guy ain't so tough.

05:44.010 --> 05:46.220
Two-on-one? Tsk-tsk.

05:46.304 --> 05:49.974
That's cheating.
Guess I'll have to even the odds.

[Sonic groans]

[Knuckles groaning]

now here comes my fisty!

06:01.611 --> 06:05.782
Ugh, he's tough.
Maybe I can run down his battery.

06:05.865 --> 06:08.159
Hey, you want to be the new me?

06:08.242 --> 06:09.619
I am the new you.

06:09.702 --> 06:11.245
Well, how about a race?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.623
Oh, I love a race. [claps]

06:13.706 --> 06:16.292
See if you can keep up with the original.

06:16.417 --> 06:17.919
[both blast off]

06:19.337 --> 06:20.379
Hm.

06:21.172 --> 06:24.550
[lasers blasting in the distance]

06:26.344 --> 06:27.595
What have I done?

06:27.678 --> 06:31.933
A great service...
for us, that is.

06:32.016 --> 06:37.396
Mighty charitable of you,
selling out your blue chum like that.

06:37.480 --> 06:40.149
Even if it was
just a slip of the tongue.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.276
[all Eggmen cackling]

06:42.360 --> 06:44.987
The hedgehog has met his match.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.032
Chaos Sonic will destroy him!

06:48.116 --> 06:51.410
And with our endless supply of power,

06:51.494 --> 06:54.288
the resistance is all but over.

06:54.372 --> 06:58.292
Now that we've seen what the shard
can do on a small scale,

06:58.376 --> 07:01.963
what say we widen our lens?

07:02.046 --> 07:03.589
[ominous music playing]

07:07.760 --> 07:12.849
Personally, I've always felt my sector
could use more smokestacks.

07:12.932 --> 07:15.435
Must you be so pedestrian?

07:15.518 --> 07:17.603
What we need is a museum!

07:17.687 --> 07:21.274
Something to commemorate our achievements.

07:21.357 --> 07:24.527
Colonnades, archways, friezes, busts---

07:24.610 --> 07:25.736
Theme park.

07:25.820 --> 07:28.739
Ugh. Save it for the bridge
and tunnel crowd.

07:28.823 --> 07:30.992
Theme. Park.

07:31.075 --> 07:33.703
[unintelligible babble]

07:33.786 --> 07:36.205
-Museum!
-Smokestacks!

07:36.289 --> 07:37.165
Theme park.

07:37.248 --> 07:39.292
Everyone pipe down!

07:39.375 --> 07:42.462
Staying local was never part of the plan.

07:42.545 --> 07:45.548
Conquer, then divide, remember?

07:45.631 --> 07:48.509
The old man is right... for once.

07:48.593 --> 07:52.597
However, with this much
shard power at our disposal,

07:52.680 --> 07:55.850
we don't have to conquer those worlds...

07:55.933 --> 07:59.187
We can transform them into
whatever we want,

07:59.270 --> 08:01.022
just like that.

08:01.105 --> 08:03.524
No more oceans,
no more jungles.

08:03.608 --> 08:06.486
With the proper adjustments
to the Shatterdrive,

08:06.569 --> 08:10.323
the portals could stay open
as long as we need.

08:10.406 --> 08:12.116
We wouldn't have to go anywhere!

08:12.200 --> 08:17.205
Imagine universal domination
from the comfort of our own home!

08:17.288 --> 08:19.582
Uh, I wouldn't do that.

08:19.665 --> 08:21.250
Who's asking you?

08:21.334 --> 08:23.377
The portals aren't natural.

08:23.461 --> 08:27.089
Keeping them open will have
repercussions on a universal scale.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.091
The varmint makes sense.

08:29.175 --> 08:31.219
What makes him the expert?

08:31.302 --> 08:34.388
I invented the Shatterdrive technology.

08:34.472 --> 08:37.975
-And we're improving it.
-Pay no attention to the squirrel.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.185
[beeps]

08:39.268 --> 08:41.062
[shutter closes]

08:41.145 --> 08:43.022
Now, where was I?

08:43.105 --> 08:44.440
Ah, yes.

08:44.524 --> 08:50.446
Why fight over one New Yoke
when we can have five?

08:50.530 --> 08:54.450

-Hello again!
-Ugh!

09:19.141 --> 09:20.393
Gotcha.

09:20.476 --> 09:24.146
-Stop. Seriously, knock it off!
-Stop. Seriously, knock it off!

09:24.230 --> 09:26.691
-Stop copying me!
-Stop copying me!

09:29.318 --> 09:30.695
Boo!

09:33.823 --> 09:36.158
And down goes Sonic!

09:36.242 --> 09:38.369
He can taste his impending defeat,

09:38.452 --> 09:41.247
which I'm guessing tastes like concrete.

09:41.330 --> 09:47.086
Ugh. If I'm half as annoying as this guy,
I really need to make some changes.

09:47.169 --> 09:49.672
Let's start by changing your face!

09:49.755 --> 09:52.300
Ugh... At least I have a face!

09:52.383 --> 09:54.760
I got to hand it to you,

09:54.844 --> 09:58.222
-you don't just lose, you lose epically!
-[Sonic yelling]

09:58.306 --> 10:00.182
Face it, you'll never beat me!

10:00.266 --> 10:04.353
-You're too slow.
-Quit your yapping and come get me.

10:13.446 --> 10:14.697
Oh, no.

10:14.780 --> 10:16.115
[clank]

10:17.491 --> 10:19.452

-Bus-ted! [gasps]
-[blasting in the distance]

10:27.877 --> 10:32.923
Sonic! He'll lead me
right back to me beauty...

10:40.056 --> 10:42.600
Doctors! Rejoice!

10:42.683 --> 10:46.771
For today, we demonstrate
the true power of the Shards--

10:46.854 --> 10:50.149
Must you make a speech every time?
Just do the thing.

10:50.816 --> 10:53.653
[scoffs] Fine. Whatever. Dr. Deep.

10:53.736 --> 10:57.156

"Chaos Terraformation".

10:57.239 --> 10:59.325
Start it up!

11:01.285 --> 11:04.080

from the Shards is underway.

Over to you, Dr. Babble.

[Sonic spin noises]

Sorry I'm late.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.932
Where's your evil,
slightly more annoying twin?

12:47.016 --> 12:48.309
He had a bus to catch.

12:48.392 --> 12:52.354
[rumbling]

12:54.440 --> 12:56.567
[groaning]

12:56.650 --> 13:00.863
What are we supposed to do about these?
That can't be good.

13:00.946 --> 13:04.492
We ain't going to be able to punch our way
out of this one.

13:04.575 --> 13:07.536
The sooner we get the Shards,
the sooner we can stop this.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.998
-Great point, Rebel.
-Let's go!

13:11.081 --> 13:13.959
[lasers shooting]

13:16.170 --> 13:17.338
[Knuckles groaning]

13:17.421 --> 13:19.089
Go, go, go!

13:20.382 --> 13:22.927
[explosions]

13:27.223 --> 13:29.934
Hey, bro. Miss me?

13:30.059 --> 13:32.394
[Sonic yelling]

13:32.478 --> 13:35.064
Now, where were we?
Oh, yeah.

13:35.147 --> 13:39.568
[fighting effort noises,
Sonic spin noises]

13:39.652 --> 13:42.363
[groaning continues]

13:42.446 --> 13:44.281
[both groaning]

13:44.365 --> 13:48.160
[cackling] Now this, this is fun...

13:48.244 --> 13:50.996
[Sonic yelling]

13:54.792 --> 13:58.128
I'm picking up at least
two more Shard signatures

13:58.212 --> 14:00.339
undiscovered somewhere in the Void.

14:00.422 --> 14:02.174
Which means...

14:02.258 --> 14:05.010
To each his own Shatterverse.

14:05.094 --> 14:08.430
-And then?
-[baby babble]

14:08.514 --> 14:10.516
Hear, hear! [coughs]

14:10.599 --> 14:13.936
[all cheer]

14:14.019 --> 14:18.983
[metal clanking]

14:19.066 --> 14:23.404
Feel free to add this butt-kicking
to your long list of failures, Sonic!

14:23.487 --> 14:26.198
[Sonic groaning]

14:28.450 --> 14:32.413
You want to know the biggest
difference between you and me?

14:32.496 --> 14:34.665
He's got us.

14:34.748 --> 14:36.458
[metal clank]

14:38.002 --> 14:40.379
And you're on your own.

14:40.462 --> 14:44.008
[Chaos Sonic yelling]

14:44.091 --> 14:46.844
-Nah, friends are a weakness.
-[Sonic] No!

14:46.927 --> 14:50.472
Remember, Sonic, this is all on you.

14:53.601 --> 14:55.603
Huh? [Rebel Rouge yelling]

15:01.025 --> 15:03.360
Leave them alone.

15:03.444 --> 15:06.238
After I'm done with you,

15:06.322 --> 15:09.116
-I'm going to destroy your friends.
-[groans]

15:11.160 --> 15:13.787
-Avast, scurvy dog!
-Dread?

15:13.871 --> 15:17.207
-You're okay!
-I owe ye one for saving me hide.

15:17.291 --> 15:20.461
But once we're squared,
it's every one for themselves

15:20.544 --> 15:22.755
when it comes to me beauty.
Nya ha ha!

15:22.838 --> 15:25.507
Must have took
one too many punches today.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.885
That makes two of us... and two of you.

15:27.968 --> 15:29.011
Don't question it.

15:29.094 --> 15:32.723
What better way to win a fight
than with a pair of Knuckles?

15:32.806 --> 15:34.892
No argument there.

15:34.975 --> 15:40.731
[fighting efforts]

15:43.651 --> 15:46.236
[clank, beeps]

15:46.320 --> 15:49.740
Shiver me timbers! Ye be me!

15:49.823 --> 15:51.450
Are you making fun of me?

15:51.533 --> 15:53.619
[powers on, beeps]

15:53.702 --> 15:55.412
[both Knuckles yelp]

15:55.496 --> 15:57.706
Knuckle's... Woah!

15:59.291 --> 16:00.751
And you, Doctor--

16:00.834 --> 16:03.963
[rumbling]

16:15.140 --> 16:16.684
Well, this is new.

16:20.104 --> 16:24.024
-What was that? An earthquake?
-No, bigger.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.319
A ripple in time and space.

16:30.864 --> 16:32.992
[chuckles]

16:34.660 --> 16:36.453
The varmint was right,

16:36.537 --> 16:41.000
guess that's what happens
when one goes drilling holes in reality.

16:41.083 --> 16:43.502
You overeager fools!

16:43.585 --> 16:47.381
Whatever it is, we can fix it later.
No sense stopping now.

16:50.676 --> 16:54.054
These fools are going to tear
the Shatterverse apart.

16:54.138 --> 16:56.056
Enough is enough.

17:03.022 --> 17:07.401
[serious music playing]

17:09.570 --> 17:15.951
[lasers blasting, metal clanking]

17:25.961 --> 17:29.631
[Sonic] Ah! Take this!

17:29.715 --> 17:33.927
[fighting noises]

17:36.305 --> 17:37.931
Hey, Sonic, are you there?

17:38.015 --> 17:42.644
Sorry, pal, but I'm a little busy
at the moment. Woah!

17:45.939 --> 17:48.025
[Nine] I have a plan.

17:48.108 --> 17:50.652
Follow my directions and lead it to me.

17:50.736 --> 17:53.322
-You sure?
-Positive. But you got to hurry.

17:53.405 --> 17:56.700
What else is new?
Hey, slow poke!

17:58.577 --> 18:00.662
Sonic, wait!

18:05.459 --> 18:10.172
-I'm starting to think he likes traps.
-Aye, he does.

18:10.756 --> 18:12.758
This is too weird.

18:15.469 --> 18:18.263
Quick, take a right. And a left.

18:20.182 --> 18:22.976
Take a right, then up the stairs!

18:25.646 --> 18:29.483
Exit the top floor!
The lab is at the end of the hall!

18:31.318 --> 18:32.903
Lead him this way!

18:36.782 --> 18:40.077
[energy crackling]

18:50.838 --> 18:53.382
We did it!
Oh, sorry.

18:53.465 --> 18:56.468
I, uh...
I know you're not really a hugger.

18:56.552 --> 18:59.263
No, I'm sorry.

18:59.346 --> 19:02.266
The Chaos Council used me.

19:02.349 --> 19:06.854
-I didn't--
-Hey, I never doubted you for a second.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.188
And that proves why.

19:08.272 --> 19:11.692
Only a true friend
could pull off a save like that.

19:11.775 --> 19:14.987
Friend? We're friends?

19:15.070 --> 19:18.240
You bet we are! Uh, quick question.

19:18.323 --> 19:22.578
How are we gonna carry them all?
They seem extra Shardy right now.

19:25.873 --> 19:27.791
This will only take a moment.

19:31.837 --> 19:34.298
Ah!

19:35.215 --> 19:38.760
[dying] I'm the best!

19:38.844 --> 19:42.848
This case should hold
the Shards and contain their energy.

19:42.931 --> 19:45.350
The more the Shards interact,
the more volatile

19:45.434 --> 19:47.519
and potentially catastrophic
they could become.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.354
Genius.

19:50.522 --> 19:54.484
As always.
Yay, teamwork!

19:56.069 --> 19:58.363
Oh... High-five!

19:58.447 --> 19:59.865
-[both laughing]
-[Sonic] Yes!

19:59.948 --> 20:04.077
Aha! Stop right there, varmints!

20:04.161 --> 20:05.579
[whirring]

20:05.662 --> 20:08.123
I hate this place.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.210
[closing theme music playing]
