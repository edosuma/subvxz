The L Word: Generation Q...</i>

00:07.132 --> 00:08.758
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

00:08.758 --> 00:10.301
<i>I have got so much
on my plate already.</i>

00:10.301 --> 00:11.428
I can help with that.

00:11.428 --> 00:13.179
<i>Your help is how this happened.</i>

00:13.179 --> 00:14.347
<i>Let me just stay out
of your way then.</i>

00:14.347 --> 00:15.682
Nat?

00:15.682 --> 00:16.766
Hey, Gigi just called me.

00:16.766 --> 00:18.101
<i>I can't get ready on my own,</i>

00:18.101 --> 00:19.310
<i>and I didn't want you
to be late.</i>

00:19.310 --> 00:20.520
It was nice to meet you.

00:20.520 --> 00:21.855
Yeah, you too.

00:21.855 --> 00:23.314
And good luck on the show.

00:23.314 --> 00:24.566
You should stay and watch.

00:24.566 --> 00:25.900
Congratulations on the baby.

00:25.900 --> 00:27.027
<i>You're not supposed
to know that.</i>

00:27.027 --> 00:27.986
<i>Look, we're not having a baby.</i>

00:27.986 --> 00:29.404
We're fine.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.864
<i>We like each other, okay?
- No, we don't.</i>

00:30.864 --> 00:32.323
<i>And to be honest,
I liked whoever</i>

00:32.323 --> 00:33.700
<i>she was fucking
while you were gone.</i>

00:33.700 --> 00:36.327
My name is Samuel Hendrix.

00:36.327 --> 00:38.538
<i>I am your professor.
I am happy you're in my class.</i>

00:38.538 --> 00:40.373
I lost a contestant

00:40.373 --> 00:42.042
<i>for the dating game?
Can you please do it for me?</i>

00:42.042 --> 00:44.544
<i>Contestant three, I choose you.</i>

00:44.544 --> 00:46.087
You're funny.

00:46.087 --> 00:48.339
<i>For a regular gal.
- Yeah.</i>

00:48.339 --> 00:49.924
<i>What is going on
between you two?</i>

00:49.924 --> 00:52.218
<i>I'm just confused.
- I'm done.</i>

00:52.218 --> 00:53.219
You want to come over?

00:53.219 --> 00:54.429
<i>Truce.</i>

00:54.429 --> 00:56.097
I don't want to push you

00:56.097 --> 00:57.223
<i>into something
that you're not ready for.</i>

00:57.223 --> 00:58.433
<i>I want to have a baby with you.</i>

00:58.433 --> 00:59.809
<i>Hey, Tess?</i>

00:59.809 --> 01:01.019
<i>I'm sorry I snapped
at you earlier.</i>

01:01.019 --> 01:02.896
<i>All is forgiven.</i>

01:02.896 --> 01:04.355
Can we just go home?

01:04.355 --> 01:06.399
<i>Great show.</i>

01:06.399 --> 01:08.735
<i>Ah...</i>

01:08.735 --> 01:10.737
<i>Uh, same-same to you.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.740
<i>I don't find trouble, yeah,
trouble finds me</i>

01:15.241 --> 01:17.160
<i>upbeat music</i>

01:17.160 --> 01:19.871
<i>That's how I feel</i>

01:19.871 --> 01:21.498
<i>Boo, it's spooky season</i>

01:21.498 --> 01:23.750
<i>- Yeah, spooky season
- Boo</i>

01:23.750 --> 01:26.503
<i>It's spooky season, yeah...</i>

01:26.503 --> 01:29.756
<i>Dani is in a very sensitive
place right now, okay?</i>

01:29.756 --> 01:32.050
<i>Gotcha.
- She's probably...</i>

01:32.050 --> 01:34.969
<i>Oof, depressed, anti-social,</i>

01:34.969 --> 01:37.055
<i>all of it. Mm-hmm.
- I get that.</i>

01:37.055 --> 01:39.641
<i>Hi, hi.
- Hey.</i>

01:39.641 --> 01:42.435
<i>Oh, wow. Look at you.
You look so good.</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.479
<i>Oh, thank you.
You know, I feel good.</i>

01:44.479 --> 01:45.939
<i>What's up, bud?
- What's up?</i>

01:45.939 --> 01:47.315
<i>Sophie thought you'd be a mess.
- What? No.</i>

01:47.315 --> 01:48.650
<i>I didn't say a mess.</i>

01:48.650 --> 01:50.110
<i>She absolutely
fucking said that.</i>

01:50.110 --> 01:51.778
<i>Not a mess.</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:53.613
<i>I just thought that, you know,
from the breakup...</i>

01:53.613 --> 01:54.614
Uh-huh. I am...

01:54.614 --> 01:55.824
<i>I am totally fine.</i>

01:55.824 --> 01:58.284
<i>I'm more than fine, actually.</i>

01:58.284 --> 01:59.994
<i>Guess who's coming
to town tonight?</i>

01:59.994 --> 02:01.746
<i>If it's Harry Styles,
can you please get us tickets?</i>

02:01.746 --> 02:03.123
<i>Is it Harry Styles?
- No.</i>

02:03.123 --> 02:04.791
<i>It is way better than that.</i>

02:04.791 --> 02:06.459
<i>Okay. Doubtful.
- Uh, who is it?</i>

02:06.459 --> 02:07.961
<i>It's Roxy.</i>

02:07.961 --> 02:09.921
<i>Roxy? What?
- Yeah.</i>

02:09.921 --> 02:12.090
<i>Wait, who's Roxy?
Ooh, chocolate.</i>

02:12.090 --> 02:13.758
<i>Mm-mm, it's sausage.
- Oh.</i>

02:13.758 --> 02:15.301
<i>Ooh. Um...
- Sorry. [chuckles]</i>

02:15.301 --> 02:18.304
<i>Roxy is Dani's bad friend.</i>

02:18.304 --> 02:19.639
<i>Ba-da,
ba-da, bad...</i>

02:19.639 --> 02:21.141
<i>She-she... No.
- Ooh.</i>

02:21.141 --> 02:22.308
<i>She's not bad.
- Okay, yeah. The last time</i>

02:22.308 --> 02:23.393
<i>she was here, you guys ended up</i>

02:23.393 --> 02:24.477
<i>in an orgy in San Luis Obispo.</i>

02:24.477 --> 02:25.937
<i>Shut the fuck up.</i>

02:25.937 --> 02:27.147
<i>Mm-hmm.
- That... that was actually</i>

02:27.147 --> 02:29.566
<i>a leather party in the Valley,</i>

02:29.566 --> 02:32.402
<i>and it was fun.
- Same thing.</i>

02:32.402 --> 02:34.154
<i>I love fun friends. I'm
a lot of people's fun friend,</i>

02:34.154 --> 02:35.947
<i>and I... that's a compliment
from me.</i>

02:35.947 --> 02:37.657
<i>She said that
she's gonna meet us here,</i>

02:37.657 --> 02:39.659
<i>but she's, like,
two hours late to everything,</i>

02:39.659 --> 02:41.327
<i>so I'm not gonna
hold my breath. Um,</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:43.163
<i>she is going to be
my wingman tonight.</i>

02:43.163 --> 02:44.539
<i>Hey.
- Oh, good for you,</i>

02:44.539 --> 02:45.832
<i>getting back on that horse.</i>

02:45.832 --> 02:47.667
<i>Mess no more.
- Yeah.</i>

02:47.667 --> 02:50.044
<i>Yeah, we are going hard
this Halloween.</i>

02:50.044 --> 02:52.005
<i>Whoa. Okay.
- Okay, now I'm scared.</i>

02:53.214 --> 02:55.341
<i>Roxy!</i>

02:55.341 --> 02:57.177
D-Bag!

02:57.177 --> 02:58.803
<i>Hi.</i>

02:58.803 --> 03:00.054
<i>Happy Halloween, bitch.</i>

03:00.054 --> 03:02.015
<i>They're gonna end up in jail.</i>

03:02.015 --> 03:03.850
<i>Well, at least they'll have you
to bail them out.</i>

03:03.850 --> 03:05.643
<i>Aw, babe.</i>

03:05.643 --> 03:08.688
<i>We can take it
to the graveyard, yeah</i>

03:08.688 --> 03:10.773
<i>Singing boo-oo-oo, yeah</i>

03:10.773 --> 03:12.483
<i>Boo-oo-oo, yeah</i>

03:12.483 --> 03:15.445
<i>Show the living
how the dead can dance</i>

03:15.445 --> 03:17.030
<i>Singing boo-oo-oo, yeah</i>

03:30.001 --> 03:32.670
Good morning, sunshine. Wow.

03:32.670 --> 03:35.506
<i>You are a deep sleeper.</i>

03:35.506 --> 03:37.217
<i>I grew up near a firehouse.</i>

03:37.217 --> 03:38.551
<i>Learned to sleep
through anything.</i>

03:38.551 --> 03:41.179
<i>For real?
- No. I took</i>

03:41.179 --> 03:43.223
<i>a gummy at 2 a.m.
because I woke up and</i>

03:43.223 --> 03:45.225
<i>I couldn't fall back asleep.
- Well, I slept</i>

03:45.225 --> 03:47.393
<i>great because I was
very tired from you.</i>

03:47.393 --> 03:48.436
<i>Wow.</i>

03:48.436 --> 03:50.605
<i>You got heels and, like, you</i>

03:50.605 --> 03:52.857
<i>look like Alice, the superstar.</i>

03:52.857 --> 03:54.108
<i>What, this?
- Yeah.</i>

03:54.108 --> 03:55.610
<i>Oh, no. I dress like this
for you.</i>

03:57.195 --> 03:59.239
<i>Hey, what about tonight?
Should we go to Dana's,</i>

03:59.239 --> 04:01.115
<i>and, like, dress up?
- Oh, man.</i>

04:01.115 --> 04:02.283
<i>I wouldn't even need a costume</i>

04:02.283 --> 04:04.369
<i>for tonight. I'm, like,</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:06.204
<i>halfway to Walking Dead extra.</i>

04:06.204 --> 04:09.332
<i>Just missing some blood here,
some dirt...</i>

04:09.332 --> 04:11.125
<i>I was thinking
it could be really fun</i>

04:11.125 --> 04:13.962
<i>if we stay here and we do,
like, a scary movie marathon?</i>

04:13.962 --> 04:15.755
<i>I know you haven't left my house
in two days, but...</i>

04:15.755 --> 04:16.839
<i>Yeah.
- Yeah?</i>

04:16.839 --> 04:18.424
<i>Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, good.</i>

04:18.424 --> 04:19.884
<i>Okay, good, good.
- Yeah. Let's keep the zombie</i>

04:19.884 --> 04:21.386
<i>off the streets.
I like the way you think.</i>

04:21.386 --> 04:22.929
<i>Yes, because I have all these</i>

04:22.929 --> 04:24.889
<i>great decorations,</i>

04:24.889 --> 04:27.267
<i>and I thought this could be
kind of fun to, like,</i>

04:27.267 --> 04:29.227
<i>hang them all.
- Wow. [laughs]</i>

04:29.227 --> 04:31.938
<i>You're, like,
a Halloween person.</i>

04:31.938 --> 04:33.523
<i>Eh. I'm more like a girl</i>

04:33.523 --> 04:34.941
<i>who steals things
from work, but...</i>

04:34.941 --> 04:37.110
<i>You're a thief.
- Yes, I'm a thief.</i>

04:37.110 --> 04:39.070
<i>Good morning. Oh. Okay.
- Morning breath.</i>

04:39.070 --> 04:40.613
<i>Yeah, pumpkin-flavored.</i>

04:40.613 --> 04:43.199
<i>Um, I was gonna make you coffee
'cause I thought,</i>

04:43.199 --> 04:45.743
<i>you know, you're sick
of making... coffee.</i>

04:45.743 --> 04:48.121
<i>Yeah? Okay, good.
- Okay. Oh, that's really nice.</i>

04:48.121 --> 04:51.124
<i>Thanks. Do you have
any contact solution?</i>

04:55.837 --> 04:59.090
<i>Mama, do you want to dress up
for Halloween?</i>

04:59.090 --> 05:00.717
<i>I found, I think it's Dorothy</i>

05:00.717 --> 05:02.218
<i>from The Wizard of Oz...</i>

05:02.218 --> 05:03.678
<i>Let me just finish her lip.
-</i>

05:03.678 --> 05:05.638
<i>Okay, I see how it is.</i>

05:05.638 --> 05:07.598
<i>Doesn't she look amazing?
Look at this.</i>

05:07.598 --> 05:09.058
You look phenomenal.

05:09.058 --> 05:10.935
<i>Yeah, there you go.
Check that out. Huh?</i>

05:12.645 --> 05:14.397
<i>I'm so happy to see
that you're still faithful</i>

05:14.397 --> 05:15.565
<i>to Dolly Parton.</i>

05:15.565 --> 05:17.608
<i>Oh, she's my higher power.</i>

05:17.608 --> 05:19.277
<i>Patty?
- Hmm?</i>

05:19.277 --> 05:20.945
<i>Ready for breakfast now?
- Yeah, sure am.</i>

05:20.945 --> 05:23.614
<i>Okay.
- Oh, happy Halloween.</i>

05:23.614 --> 05:25.783
<i>Oh, also, the smoke machine
is gonna be delivered</i>

05:25.783 --> 05:28.244
<i>at noon to the bar.
- You look good.</i>

05:28.244 --> 05:29.746
<i>So, I'm gonna go sign for it.
- Cool, thanks.</i>

05:29.746 --> 05:31.122
<i>What were you last year, Ma?
I forget.</i>

05:31.122 --> 05:32.665
What? I don't know.

05:32.665 --> 05:34.125
<i>Hang on a second,
I'll find a photo.</i>

05:34.125 --> 05:35.626
<i>Here you go.
- A photo?</i>

05:35.626 --> 05:37.295
<i>A photo of what?</i>

05:37.295 --> 05:38.755
It's, uh... hold on.

05:38.755 --> 05:40.798
<i>I just got an email
from the contractor.</i>

05:40.798 --> 05:42.508
<i>F... Wh...
What are you talking about?</i>

05:42.508 --> 05:44.010
<i>Are you good with n/naka
tonight for dinner?</i>

05:44.010 --> 05:45.845
<i>Uh, how am I
supposed to eat this?</i>

05:45.845 --> 05:47.680
<i>Do you need a...
Could you get her a spoon?</i>

05:47.680 --> 05:49.349
<i>Oh, Patty, I'm sorry.
Yeah, of course.</i>

05:49.349 --> 05:50.683
I don't have a spoon.

05:50.683 --> 05:52.685
<i>So?
-</i>

05:52.685 --> 05:54.437
<i>Are you...</i>

05:56.397 --> 05:58.649
<i>Are you good with n/naka?
There you go.</i>

05:58.649 --> 06:00.693
<i>Uh, yeah. God, Gloria is
gonna be here at four,</i>

06:00.693 --> 06:02.987
<i>and then, yes.</i>

06:02.987 --> 06:04.530
<i>Okay.</i>

06:06.574 --> 06:09.160
<i>Oh, she's gonna get cold
in that. Can I grab this?</i>

06:09.160 --> 06:10.995
<i>Hey. Hey.
- What?</i>

06:10.995 --> 06:13.081
<i>Here, Mama. Let's get this on.</i>

06:13.081 --> 06:15.124
<i>What? For me?
- Yeah.</i>

06:15.124 --> 06:16.751
<i>But that's not
part of my costume.</i>

06:16.751 --> 06:18.169
<i>Well, you'll just
wear it for now, okay?</i>

06:18.169 --> 06:20.129
<i>How's that?
- Good.</i>

06:20.129 --> 06:22.006
<i>You know what?
How about we go for a walk</i>

06:22.006 --> 06:24.592
<i>around the reservoir
before Gloria gets here?</i>

06:24.592 --> 06:26.469
<i>Just you and me, Dolly.
What do you say?</i>

06:26.469 --> 06:28.388
I say, "Get my pocketbook."

06:28.388 --> 06:30.973
Okay, then, Mama.

06:30.973 --> 06:32.850
<i>I'll get your pocketbook.
It's right here.</i>

06:32.850 --> 06:34.477
Tess?

06:34.477 --> 06:36.396
<i>Maybe we sit by the water
a little while, huh?</i>

06:36.396 --> 06:38.648
<i>I'll see you... later?
We'll touch base?</i>

06:38.648 --> 06:40.400
<i>Yes.</i>

06:41.359 --> 06:43.653
<i>Bye.</i>

06:43.653 --> 06:46.072
<i>You look just like
the real Dolly. [laughs]</i>

06:46.072 --> 06:47.907
Oh, get out of here.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.243
<i>Okay, so I made
a whole list of questions</i>

06:50.243 --> 06:51.744
<i>for your coworker
and their partner,</i>

06:51.744 --> 06:54.205
<i>so when we get there,
I kind of figure that...</i>

06:54.205 --> 06:55.665
<i>Ta-da.</i>

06:55.665 --> 06:57.542
<i>No.
- What?</i>

06:57.542 --> 06:59.377
<i>No, I thought
we nixed the avocado.</i>

06:59.377 --> 07:00.711
<i>But you said
you'd think about it.</i>

07:00.711 --> 07:02.255
<i>Look, we're about to meet
the only trans,</i>

07:02.255 --> 07:03.423
<i>nonbinary parents that we know.</i>

07:03.423 --> 07:04.924
<i>And?</i>

07:04.924 --> 07:06.801
<i>And I don't want to be there
as an avocado.</i>

07:06.801 --> 07:08.386
<i>I have questions
about life insurance</i>

07:08.386 --> 07:09.929
<i>on the list.
- Except it's Halloween.</i>

07:11.556 --> 07:13.766
<i>And I'm pretty sure
their family will be dressed up.</i>

07:13.766 --> 07:15.268
<i>Okay, well, do you have</i>

07:15.268 --> 07:16.811
<i>any other questions
that you want to add?</i>

07:16.811 --> 07:18.896
<i>I mean,
"Why is my baby zaddy so fine?"</i>

07:18.896 --> 07:21.315
<i>I'm serious, Maribel.
-</i>

07:21.315 --> 07:23.359
<i>What?
- Okay, just...</i>

<i>let me know if you
think of anything, okay?</i>

07:24.735 --> 07:26.863
<i>And, uh, I'm sorry,</i>

07:26.863 --> 07:28.739
<i>but it's a "no" on the avocado.
I love you, though.</i>

07:28.739 --> 07:30.408
<i>I do, I promise.
- No.</i>

07:30.408 --> 07:32.452
<i>Come on, I need another half.</i>

07:32.452 --> 07:34.537
<i>- Bad bitch
- I'm-a roll up in a golden</i>

07:34.537 --> 07:37.915
<i>Carriage pulled by six
white stallions that match</i>

07:37.915 --> 07:39.292
<i>What I'm wearing, I walk in</i>

07:39.292 --> 07:41.544
<i>And my status is apparent</i>

07:41.544 --> 07:43.463
<i>And I fan myself with feathers
while I yawn in Paris</i>

07:43.463 --> 07:45.465
<i>My hair and my nails
and the heels that I'm on</i>

07:45.465 --> 07:47.300
<i>All look like the candy
I got on my arm</i>

07:47.300 --> 07:49.135
<i>You can't taste the candy
I got on my arm</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:51.095
<i>Angie!
- Oh...</i>

07:51.095 --> 07:52.305
<i>Hi. Oh, my God, guess what?
- Hi.</i>

07:52.305 --> 07:53.973
<i>I got my first professional gig.</i>

07:53.973 --> 07:55.975
<i>What? Oh!
- I'm a paid actor.</i>

07:55.975 --> 07:57.935
<i>Oh! Oh, my God!
-</i>

07:57.935 --> 07:59.479
<i>That's incredible. Bella.</i>

07:59.479 --> 08:00.771
<i>I'm the only undergrad freshman
who made it.</i>

08:00.771 --> 08:02.398
<i>Well, except for this
one other person,</i>

08:02.398 --> 08:03.524
<i>but who cares about her.
You have to come see me tonight.</i>

08:03.524 --> 08:04.859
<i>It's one night only.</i>

08:04.859 --> 08:06.652
<i>Oh, that's such a bummer.</i>

08:06.652 --> 08:08.821
<i>I-I just... I-I can't.</i>

08:08.821 --> 08:11.240
<i>What? No.
- Yeah,</i>

08:11.240 --> 08:14.160
<i>I have this... I have this exam
that I have to study for.</i>

08:14.160 --> 08:15.536
<i>Yeah, but you always
have to study.</i>

08:15.536 --> 08:17.288
<i>It's like...
you're missing college.</i>

08:17.288 --> 08:18.873
<i>I-I know. I'm-I'm really sorry,</i>

08:18.873 --> 08:20.625
<i>but, you know, I know
you're gonna kill it.</i>

08:20.625 --> 08:22.335
Got to go, break a leg.

08:22.335 --> 08:23.461
<i>Angie.</i>

08:23.461 --> 08:25.171
<i>Let them eat cake</i>

08:25.171 --> 08:26.422
<i>Let them eat cake,
let them eat it</i>

08:26.422 --> 08:28.174
<i>You got to eat that cake</i>

08:28.174 --> 08:29.884
<i>Let them eat cake,
let them eat cake</i>

08:29.884 --> 08:31.886
<i>I'd like to do
the alternative assignment.</i>

08:31.886 --> 08:33.554
Okay, have you

08:33.554 --> 08:35.932
<i>decided which work
you want to use?</i>

08:35.932 --> 08:37.642

08:39.101 --> 08:41.229
<i>Right, okay. So...</i>

08:41.229 --> 08:44.148
<i>all you have to do is reimagine
that in a different medium.</i>

08:44.148 --> 08:46.192
<i>You could do a movement piece,</i>

08:46.192 --> 08:49.695
<i>a culinary work of art,

08:49.695 --> 08:52.114

Does your tummy hurt?</i>

10:15.698 --> 10:18.701
<i>All right, what do we say
we lay off the sugar</i>

10:18.701 --> 10:20.953
<i>for a little bit? Yeah? Cool.
- Okay.</i>

<i>And, um, if you follow me,</i>

10:23.789 --> 10:25.458
<i>I can get you a wet wipe

10:25.458 --> 10:27.084
<i>I'm sorry, okay?</i>

10:27.084 --> 10:28.461
<i>I-I think I made this
all a lot worse.</i>

10:28.461 --> 10:30.296
<i>Not at all.
-</i>

10:30.296 --> 10:32.256
<i>Let me tell you,

<i>Come with me.
- Okay.</i>

10:35.760 --> 10:39.347
<i>Learning so much already.
-</i>

10:40.348 --> 10:42.642
Well, let's get you a drink.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.268
<i>Yeah.
- Let's go.</i>

10:44.268 --> 10:45.811
<i>It's good to see you
out of the office.</i>

10:45.811 --> 10:47.188
<i>Right?</i>

10:47.188 --> 10:49.315
<i>But the publishing
process just takes</i>

10:49.315 --> 10:52.818
<i>so goddamn long that,
by the time my debut dropped,</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:54.320
<i>I felt like a different writer,</i>

10:54.320 --> 10:57.156
<i>and I can't even
read it now, so...</i>

10:57.156 --> 10:59.367
<i>Yeah, I'm glad
nobody else read it.</i>

10:59.367 --> 11:02.328
<i>Mm... Mm.
- Stop.</i>

11:02.328 --> 11:04.163
<i>Yep.
- No. Stop.</i>

11:04.163 --> 11:06.332
<i>I'm so sorry.</i>

11:06.332 --> 11:08.459
<i>I'm, like, on chapter six

11:08.459 --> 11:11.295
<i>Oh, my gosh. It's like you are
sniffing my dirty laundry.</i>

11:11.295 --> 11:13.339
<i>No.

11:19.512 --> 11:20.513
<i>What?</i>

11:20.513 --> 11:21.681
<i>Yeah.</i>

11:21.681 --> 11:23.599
<i>No, no. It's okay.
-</i>

11:25.017 --> 11:27.144
<i>Why'd you think I wanted

11:27.144 --> 11:30.356
<i>I just thought you really liked
malt balls or something.</i>

11:30.356 --> 11:33.567
<i>No, no, no, no.
It is because we can be us.</i>

11:33.567 --> 11:34.902
<i>We're in disguise,</i>

11:34.902 --> 11:36.529
<i>and we're gonna have

<i>Okay.
- Come on.</i>

11:38.030 --> 11:39.699

<i>Oh, my gosh.
- No, no, no, no.</i>

11:44.578 --> 11:47.415
<i>No, no, no, no, no.
- Oh, my God. Yes!</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:48.666
<i>Come on.
- Oh, my God.</i>

11:50.543 --> 11:52.378
<i>Okay.
- Come on, it's just</i>

11:52.378 --> 11:54.880
<i>the drama department.
It's not gonna be scary at all.</i>

11:54.880 --> 11:57.591
<i>Uh...</i>

11:57.591 --> 11:59.051
<i>Okay. Um, but,</i>

11:59.051 --> 12:00.553
<i>if I see a clown... Mm-mm.</i>

12:00.553 --> 12:02.972
<i>There's not gonna be a clown.</i>

12:02.972 --> 12:05.015
<i>Are you sure?
- Yes, yes, yes, yes.</i>

12:05.015 --> 12:06.475
<i>Can...</i>

12:06.475 --> 12:09.019
<i>How do you see where

12:17.611 --> 12:21.073
<i>Show me your city</i>

12:21.073 --> 12:23.492
<i>Shine bright</i>

12:23.492 --> 12:25.578
<i>Oh, oh, ooh, babe...</i>

12:25.578 --> 12:28.247
<i>She's cute.
- Duh. She looks like a mistake.</i>

12:28.247 --> 12:29.749
Yeah, but, like,

12:29.749 --> 12:31.417
<i>the good kind.</i>

12:32.793 --> 12:34.462
<i>Hello?</i>

12:34.462 --> 12:35.755
Shane? No.

12:35.755 --> 12:37.256
What? She's fucking hot.

12:37.256 --> 12:38.632
Uh...

12:38.632 --> 12:40.259
<i>She-She's got
a serious girlfriend.</i>

12:40.259 --> 12:41.635
<i>Yeah, she'd probably
still sleep with you anyway.</i>

12:41.635 --> 12:43.137
<i>Oh, shit.
I don't fuck with that.</i>

12:43.137 --> 12:44.263
<i>What are you
starting rumors for?</i>

12:44.263 --> 12:44.972
<i>She's with Tess. They're, like,</i>

12:44.972 --> 12:46.098
<i>fucking married.</i>

12:46.098 --> 12:48.058
<i>Come here, Finn.</i>

12:48.058 --> 12:49.769
<i>I just think that,
the other day, I...</i>

12:49.769 --> 12:51.103
What about her?

12:51.103 --> 12:52.938
<i>I sort of, maybe,
saw something and...</i>

12:52.938 --> 12:53.939
<i>No way. Bullshit.</i>

12:53.939 --> 12:56.108
<i>You're nuts. Hey, uh,</i>

12:56.108 --> 12:58.110
<i>these are from the folks
over in the booth.</i>

12:58.110 --> 13:01.155
<i>Let me know if you guys
need anything else, okay?</i>

13:01.155 --> 13:02.948
<i>Well, look at that.
- Oh.</i>

13:02.948 --> 13:04.200
<i>Cheers.
- Thank you.</i>

13:04.200 --> 13:06.911
<i>Well, what am I?
Fucking invisible?</i>

13:06.911 --> 13:09.580
<i>No. You're just not single.
- Mm.</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:11.540
<i>Okay, but they don't know that.</i>

13:11.540 --> 13:13.793
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

13:13.793 --> 13:15.127
Well, the costume's not great.

13:15.127 --> 13:16.462
<i>She's right.
- Oh, come on.</i>

13:16.462 --> 13:18.297
<i>Are you kidding me right now?</i>

13:18.297 --> 13:20.466
<i>Look at this shit right here.
Look at this gangster shit.</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:21.967
Yeah, we're looking at it.

13:21.967 --> 13:23.552
It's not good.

13:23.552 --> 13:26.055
<i>I am "raining cats and dogs."
Meow, ruff, ruff.</i>

13:26.055 --> 13:27.056
<i>Definitely not.
- No.</i>

13:27.056 --> 13:28.057
Really? Come on,

13:28.057 --> 13:30.601
<i>it's funny. I made this.</i>

13:30.601 --> 13:32.603
<i>Yeah, I can tell.
- Aw, fuck.</i>

13:32.603 --> 13:34.814
<i>Look, you're hot,
but the costume's not.</i>

13:34.814 --> 13:37.149
<i>Come with us.
Let's-let's fix this.</i>

13:37.149 --> 13:39.735
<i>All right. I spent
the whole day at Ross's</i>

13:39.735 --> 13:41.779
<i>putting this together.
You know, in that section</i>

13:41.779 --> 13:43.364
<i>where they got all
the crystals and stuff?</i>

13:43.364 --> 13:44.615
<i>That's clear.
Less clothing, less is more.</i>

13:44.615 --> 13:45.699
It's Halloween.

13:49.286 --> 13:51.205
<i>So, they actually carried
our first child.</i>

13:51.205 --> 13:53.833
<i>Can you hold?
- Yeah, it was totally unplanned.</i>

13:53.833 --> 13:56.794
<i>It was before Reese and I
were together. I was dating this</i>

13:56.794 --> 13:59.046
<i>gay cis guy, and he was, like...</i>

13:59.046 --> 14:00.339
<i>he turned out to be the worst.</i>

14:00.339 --> 14:01.465
<i>Yeah, no, I, uh...</i>

14:01.465 --> 14:03.050
<i>I dated one of those, too, so...</i>

14:03.050 --> 14:06.720
<i>And our middle two
is from my first marriage.</i>

14:06.720 --> 14:08.055
<i>The boring old hetero way.</i>

14:08.055 --> 14:09.598
And then we adopted Phoenix

14:09.598 --> 14:11.308
<i>from foster care last year.</i>

14:11.308 --> 14:13.143
<i>Hey, Phoenix?
- Yeah?</i>

14:13.143 --> 14:14.520
<i>Honey, will you
come and eat some</i>

14:14.520 --> 14:17.648
<i>of this turkey jerky?
- Thank you, nibi.</i>

14:17.648 --> 14:19.859
<i>She is gonna crash big-time.</i>

14:19.859 --> 14:22.319
<i>Wait, so do they
call you both nibi?</i>

14:22.319 --> 14:23.863
<i>Or where did that come from?</i>

14:23.863 --> 14:26.365
<i>Oh, no, no, no.
So, I'm dama and Max is nibi.</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:27.533
That's so cute.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.368
Yeah, we like it.

14:29.368 --> 14:31.620
<i>Yeah, we just
sort of figured, you know,</i>

14:31.620 --> 14:33.205
<i>"dad" is just a sound.
- Mm.</i>

14:33.205 --> 14:34.999
<i>I mean, the meaning
is totally made up.</i>

14:34.999 --> 14:36.625
<i>Aw, that's
really funny because,</i>

14:36.625 --> 14:38.878
<i>for the longest time,
I thought "dad" was just</i>

14:38.878 --> 14:41.297
<i>a person my mom made up, so...</i>

14:42.506 --> 14:45.009
<i>Same, honey.
- Right?</i>

14:45.009 --> 14:47.011
<i>But, baby girl,</i>

14:47.011 --> 14:49.096
<i>you got to get rid of that shit
before the baby comes.</i>

14:49.096 --> 14:53.058
<i>Trust me, it'll hit you
when you least expect it.</i>

14:53.058 --> 14:56.228
<i>Yeah, wow, um...</i>

14:56.228 --> 14:57.938
<i>That's a lot.</i>

14:57.938 --> 14:59.940
<i>Makes sense, though.</i>

14:59.940 --> 15:02.109
Are you two in therapy?

15:02.109 --> 15:04.987
<i>Uh, yeah, I mean, I am,</i>

15:04.987 --> 15:06.405
<i>and, uh,
I'm a therapist as well,</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:07.781
<i>so I kind of live in that world.</i>

15:07.781 --> 15:08.782
<i>Oh.</i>

15:08.782 --> 15:10.200
<i>Yeah, no, I do not.</i>

15:10.200 --> 15:11.827
We just found it so helpful

15:11.827 --> 15:13.871
<i>to get on the same page
about everything.</i>

15:13.871 --> 15:15.706
<i>You know, parenting...</i>

15:15.706 --> 15:18.375
And life. So much pops up,

15:18.375 --> 15:19.960
<i>so it's just so much easier</i>

15:19.960 --> 15:23.255
<i>if you have the same
shared guiding principles.</i>

15:23.255 --> 15:25.424
<i>Oh, we have one. [chuckles]</i>

15:25.424 --> 15:27.176
<i>"Don't drop the baby."
- Girl.</i>

15:27.176 --> 15:28.677
<i>Obviously, don't drop the baby.</i>

15:28.677 --> 15:29.929
<i>You better quit playing.</i>

15:29.929 --> 15:31.388
<i>I'm not gonna drop the baby.</i>

15:31.388 --> 15:33.557
<i>But, like, no,
what happens if we do?</i>

15:33.557 --> 15:35.267
<i>I mean, generally,
they'll be all right.</i>

15:35.267 --> 15:38.437
<i>Yeah, they bounce
right back. [laughs]</i>

15:39.313 --> 15:42.608


15:42.608 --> 15:44.610
<i>No, no, no, no, no, no.
- What?</i>

15:44.610 --> 15:46.445
<i>Oh, my God. Calm down.</i>

15:46.445 --> 15:48.364
<i>What?
- You're screaming.</i>

15:48.364 --> 15:50.449
<i>You're like...</i>

15:50.449 --> 15:52.076
<i>Stop. You should've
seen your face.</i>

15:52.076 --> 15:54.954
<i>You were like, "Oh, my God.
Hold me, help me."</i>

15:54.954 --> 15:56.330
<i>Why you looking at me?</i>

15:56.330 --> 15:57.581
<i>You just screamed...
-</i>

15:57.581 --> 15:58.916
<i>I wasn't like that.</i>

15:58.916 --> 16:00.834
Okay, you were squeezing my arm

16:00.834 --> 16:02.544
<i>so hard, I thought
you were trying</i>

16:02.544 --> 16:04.213
<i>to take my blood pressure.
- No, I wasn't. [laughs]</i>

16:06.757 --> 16:09.176
<i>Okay. Oh, my gosh.</i>

16:09.176 --> 16:11.303
<i>Well, either way,
I just have to say,</i>

16:11.303 --> 16:13.597
<i>that was the most fun I've had</i>

16:13.597 --> 16:15.307
<i>in a really long time.
- Yeah?</i>

16:15.307 --> 16:16.976
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

16:17.893 --> 16:20.104
<i>Me, too.
-</i>

16:28.278 --> 16:29.738
<i>G!
- Oh, my God.</i>

16:29.738 --> 16:31.991
<i>Shit.
- I knew that was you.</i>

16:31.991 --> 16:34.326
<i>You play too much, acting like
you weren't gonna come see me.</i>

16:34.326 --> 16:35.953
<i>Oh, my God, surprise.</i>

16:35.953 --> 16:37.663
<i>I'd never miss your first gig.</i>

16:37.663 --> 16:39.289
<i>Who's that guy
you're kissing, hmm?</i>

16:39.289 --> 16:41.500
<i>Oh, I don't know.
Just... some guy I met in line.</i>

16:41.500 --> 16:43.419
<i>Oh.
- Yeah.</i>

16:43.419 --> 16:44.670
<i>Sorry.</i>

16:44.670 --> 16:47.089
<i>Congratulations, though.
That's... great.</i>

16:47.089 --> 16:49.174
<i>You know,
I'll-I'll see you at home.</i>

16:49.174 --> 16:50.926
<i>Okay.</i>

16:50.926 --> 16:52.720
<i>See ya.</i>

16:56.473 --> 16:59.560
<i>Ugh, that was close.
I don't think she saw us.</i>

17:04.273 --> 17:06.400
<i>Um...</i>

17:08.110 --> 17:09.486
<i>I'm sorry. Um...</i>

17:09.486 --> 17:10.946
<i>What?</i>

17:10.946 --> 17:13.615
<i>Is something wrong?</i>

17:13.615 --> 17:15.743
<i>Is it, like...</i>

17:15.743 --> 17:19.371
<i>is it, like, awkward, um...</i>

17:19.371 --> 17:21.582
<i>that I'm, like, your teacher?</i>

17:21.582 --> 17:24.376
<i>No. 'Cause when we met,
you weren't--</i>

17:24.376 --> 17:26.754
<i>Yeah. Right, right.
- You-- We weren't.</i>

17:26.754 --> 17:28.464
<i>Yeah.</i>

17:32.134 --> 17:34.219
<i>But I like you.</i>

17:34.219 --> 17:35.971
<i>I like you, too.</i>

17:35.971 --> 17:38.891
Okay.

17:38.891 --> 17:40.726
Okay, I'm gonna need some help.

17:42.811 --> 17:46.023
<i>Darling, go, watch your head</i>

17:46.023 --> 17:49.735
<i>Don't look down, baby,
under the bed</i>

17:49.735 --> 17:52.696
<i>Let it show what you bred...</i>

17:56.450 --> 17:57.409
<i>Hey.</i>

17:57.409 --> 17:59.536
<i>Hey, um, so bit of a snag.</i>

17:59.536 --> 18:01.830
<i>Um, they sent a new nurse.</i>

18:01.830 --> 18:03.123
Okay.

18:03.123 --> 18:05.834
<i>It's not Gloria,
it's, um... Hold on.</i>

18:05.834 --> 18:07.377
<i>Hey, what was your name again?</i>

18:07.377 --> 18:09.463
<i>Uh, Victor.
- Victor.</i>

18:09.463 --> 18:10.672
<i>They sent Victor.</i>

18:10.672 --> 18:12.424
<i>All right, well, then,</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:15.052
<i>get him situated, and then
come down here and meet me.</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:16.804
<i>No, I don't think
that I can do that.</i>

18:16.804 --> 18:18.931
<i>Tess, it's dinner.</i>

18:18.931 --> 18:21.308
<i>It's gonna be a few hours.
It's just that.</i>

18:21.308 --> 18:22.768
<i>Okay, no,
you're not listening to me.</i>

18:22.768 --> 18:24.812
<i>I'm not gonna leave my mom alone
with a stranger.</i>

18:24.812 --> 18:26.146
<i>But he's not a stranger,</i>

18:26.146 --> 18:27.898
<i>he comes from
the same agency Gloria--</i>

18:27.898 --> 18:29.399
<i>Okay, look, I said
that I'm not doing it, okay?</i>

18:31.026 --> 18:32.236
<i>All right.</i>

18:32.236 --> 18:33.821
<i>Okay.</i>

18:33.821 --> 18:34.988
<i>I got to go.
- Do you want--</i>

18:34.988 --> 18:36.698
Hello?

18:36.698 --> 18:38.742
<i>somber music</i>

18:51.839 --> 18:54.049
<i>All right, how are you gonna</i>

18:54.049 --> 18:55.300
<i>make me look hotter?</i>

18:55.300 --> 18:56.802
<i>Not Seth.
- Yeah.</i>

18:56.802 --> 18:58.804
<i>For starters. Yeah.
- What?</i>

18:58.804 --> 19:00.222
<i>Oh, my God.
- What about this thing?</i>

19:00.222 --> 19:02.641
<i>I think we can split it
at the seams.</i>

19:02.641 --> 19:05.519
<i>What? Split it?
- Okay.</i>

19:05.519 --> 19:07.604
<i>Are you serious?</i>

19:07.604 --> 19:08.981
<i>Oh, my...</i>

19:08.981 --> 19:11.233
<i>So much better. That's nice.
- Bye.</i>

19:11.233 --> 19:13.402
<i>Pilates arms.
- You guys...</i>

19:13.402 --> 19:15.279
<i>I love that.
That looks really good.</i>

19:15.279 --> 19:16.738
<i>Oh, my God.
- Yeah.</i>

19:16.738 --> 19:18.782
<i>The costume doesn't even
make sense anymore.</i>

19:18.782 --> 19:20.117
<i>You got to show
a little skin, baby.</i>

19:20.117 --> 19:21.410
Didn't make sense to begin with.

19:21.410 --> 19:23.203
What are you talking about?

19:23.203 --> 19:24.788
<i>Look at that, spooky.</i>

19:24.788 --> 19:27.708
<i>At least now, you...</i>

19:27.708 --> 19:30.586
<i>can have some swag
for Halloween.</i>

19:30.586 --> 19:32.588
<i>Oh, my God.
- Look at that.</i>

19:32.588 --> 19:34.381
<i>Is it better, really?</i>

19:34.381 --> 19:36.133
<i>Pssh. You look...</i>

19:36.133 --> 19:37.259
<i>Sexy.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

19:37.259 --> 19:38.844
<i>Okay.</i>

19:38.844 --> 19:40.470
<i>All right, I'm gonna go pee.
It's gonna take me</i>

19:40.470 --> 19:42.764
<i>a minute to get
these pants back up.</i>

19:42.764 --> 19:45.434
You do look cute, for real.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.520
<i>Excuse me.</i>

19:48.520 --> 19:49.688
<i>What?</i>

19:49.688 --> 19:51.523
<i>She is into you.</i>

19:51.523 --> 19:53.025
<i>What? No.</i>

19:53.025 --> 19:55.194
<i>Yeah, she wants to fuck.
She wants to go.</i>

19:55.194 --> 19:56.695
<i>No, no. She's like that
with everyone.</i>

19:56.695 --> 19:58.155
<i>No, she is not.
- Yeah, she is.</i>

19:58.155 --> 20:00.782
<i>Stop it. Trust me,
she's into you.</i>

20:00.782 --> 20:02.201
Get it.

20:02.201 --> 20:05.704
Okay, let's game plan.

20:05.704 --> 20:08.624
<i>If we don't like any
of the prospects here,</i>

20:08.624 --> 20:10.876
<i>there is a rooftop
screening of Bound</i>

20:10.876 --> 20:13.045
<i>on the Eastside.
Could be some cuties.</i>

20:13.045 --> 20:16.048
<i>Or we could Uber
to the WeHo Carnaval.</i>

20:16.048 --> 20:17.549
<i>Uh, that might be a shit show.</i>

20:17.549 --> 20:19.968
<i>I think I heard about
a block party in Venice.</i>

20:19.968 --> 20:22.054
<i>We could check that out...
- Do you, uh,</i>

20:22.054 --> 20:25.432
<i>want to... go home with me?</i>

20:25.432 --> 20:28.602
<i>To watch reruns
of One Tree Hill or...</i>

20:28.602 --> 20:30.562
<i>I'm... yes, but, uh,</i>

20:30.562 --> 20:32.564
<i>no.</i>

20:32.564 --> 20:34.441
<i>I mean, like,</i>

20:34.441 --> 20:37.027
<i>you know, I'm single,
you're single.</i>

20:37.027 --> 20:38.946
<i>Could be fun?</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:41.323
<i>I'm halfway out the door, baby.</i>

20:42.491 --> 20:46.370
<i>Okay. [laughs] Let's do it.</i>

21:01.260 --> 21:03.220
<i>tense music</i>

21:12.062 --> 21:15.274
<i>Hey, uh...</i>

21:15.274 --> 21:18.193
<i>you good?</i>

21:18.193 --> 21:19.778
<i>Uh, yeah.</i>

21:21.822 --> 21:23.615
<i>Yeah, yeah, I'm good.</i>

21:31.498 --> 21:32.666
<i>What do you mean
you want to go?</i>

21:32.666 --> 21:34.584
<i>I'm tired.</i>

21:34.584 --> 21:38.422
<i>It's early, though. I mean,
it's, it's not even eight.</i>

21:38.422 --> 21:40.465
<i>Look, I didn't come here
to get interrogated.</i>

21:40.465 --> 21:42.801
<i>I just...
Can we just go home, please?</i>

21:42.801 --> 21:45.304
<i>I haven't even gotten
through half of my questions.</i>

21:45.304 --> 21:46.972
<i>I don't know. Just google them.</i>

21:46.972 --> 21:49.141
<i>You know you can't really google
these kinds of questions.</i>

21:49.141 --> 21:52.644
<i>Honestly, I didn't know that
they were gonna be this nosy.</i>

21:52.644 --> 21:56.273
<i>Yeah. No, I know, but...
I don't know, I still like 'em.</i>

21:56.273 --> 21:59.818
<i>And, look, I... This is
important, you know, for me.</i>

22:01.778 --> 22:03.780
<i>Babe, I know.</i>

22:03.780 --> 22:06.950
<i>You should stay, though,
but I'm gonna go home, okay?</i>

22:06.950 --> 22:10.329
<i>Okay. Yeah, okay. Love you.</i>

22:10.329 --> 22:13.623
<i>Love you, too.</i>

22:13.623 --> 22:15.167
Excuse me.

22:15.167 --> 22:18.503
<i>Um, can I have a cupcake?
- Hi. Want a cupcake?</i>

22:18.503 --> 22:20.464
<i>Yeah.
- Okay, yeah, for sure.</i>

22:20.464 --> 22:22.841
<i>Here you go. Happy Halloween.
Love your costume.</i>

22:22.841 --> 22:24.426
Thank you.

22:24.426 --> 22:26.011
Wow. A princess.

22:34.186 --> 22:36.021
Oh, God.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.398
<i>Oh, God, it's gonna get bad.</i>

22:38.398 --> 22:40.317
<i>Oh...</i>

22:40.317 --> 22:42.069
<i>Oh, it's bad.
- Mm.</i>

22:42.069 --> 22:45.655
<i>It's bad.
- Oh, yeah, it's so bad.</i>

22:45.655 --> 22:47.240
<i>Are you not watching?</i>

22:47.240 --> 22:48.658
<i>Oh, no, no, I totally am.</i>

22:48.658 --> 22:51.411
<i>Are you asleep? Oh, my God.</i>

22:51.411 --> 22:53.080
<i>This has happened to me before.</i>

22:53.080 --> 22:56.500
<i>Okay, it's just, my-my eyes
are burning like hell</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:58.919
<i>because I've been in
the same contacts for 48 hours.</i>

22:58.919 --> 23:00.837
<i>Well, why don't you just
take it out?</i>

23:00.837 --> 23:02.589
<i>Because one of them now feels
like it's, like,</i>

23:02.589 --> 23:04.341
<i>lodged up
in my brain or something.</i>

23:04.341 --> 23:06.218
<i>Why didn't you tell me?</i>

23:06.218 --> 23:09.221
<i>Because you wake up looking like
you're in a tampon commercial.</i>

23:09.221 --> 23:11.848
<i>Okay, is that a compliment?
'Cause that kind of feels</i>

23:11.848 --> 23:14.393
<i>like it could go either way.
- It's just, you're like...</i>

23:14.393 --> 23:15.894
<i>you're like this perfect person.</i>

23:15.894 --> 23:17.896
<i>Ah...
- And-and I drool, and--</i>

23:17.896 --> 23:19.898


23:19.898 --> 23:21.650
What was that?

23:21.650 --> 23:23.693
<i>I-I don't know
'cause I can't see.</i>

23:27.072 --> 23:29.533
<i>Maybe a squirrel?
-</i>

23:29.533 --> 23:30.867
<i>Okay,
that's-that's not a squirrel.</i>

23:30.867 --> 23:32.744
Okay, okay.

23:32.744 --> 23:34.663
<i>Oh, my God. What? What? Wait.
- Somebody's trying to break in.</i>

23:34.663 --> 23:36.206
<i>No. You serious?
- Find my phone. Find my phone.</i>

23:36.206 --> 23:37.374
<i>Find my phone.
- I don't have your phone.</i>

23:37.374 --> 23:39.334
Fuck!

23:39.334 --> 23:40.919
<i>It's in the kitchen.</i>

23:42.921 --> 23:45.298


23:53.140 --> 23:55.559
<i>How high can you take me,
baby?</i>

23:55.559 --> 23:58.603
<i>Feel me lately,
make me lazy...</i>

23:58.603 --> 24:01.273
<i>Don't worry. It is just me.
- Oh.</i>

24:01.273 --> 24:03.233
<i>Thank God it was just you.
-</i>

24:03.233 --> 24:06.361
<i>Take two,
can you make it memorable?</i>

24:06.361 --> 24:09.364
<i>How high can you take me,
baby?</i>

24:09.364 --> 24:12.367
<i>Feel me lately,
make me lazy</i>

24:12.367 --> 24:15.454
<i>You make me dizzy, dizzy,
spinning round the room</i>

24:15.454 --> 24:19.458
<i>Make me dizzy, dizzy,
all my daisies bloom</i>

24:19.458 --> 24:21.793
<i>Now I'm a sucker, sucker,
lolli, lolli</i>

24:21.793 --> 24:23.628
<i>Hotter than a cup of coffee</i>

24:23.628 --> 24:25.297
<i>You're my secret garden...</i>

24:25.297 --> 24:27.132
<i>Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
I got you something.</i>

24:27.132 --> 24:29.217
<i>What?
- Wait, wait, wait.</i>

24:29.217 --> 24:31.928
<i>A little sweet and sour
always does me right...</i>

24:31.928 --> 24:33.472
<i>Bam.</i>

24:33.472 --> 24:35.474
<i>Come on.
-</i>

24:35.474 --> 24:37.809
<i>You didn't have
to get me anything.</i>

24:37.809 --> 24:39.561
<i>Oh, I did. I really did.</i>

24:39.561 --> 24:41.480
<i>We can make
the magic happen...</i>

24:41.480 --> 24:43.982
<i>So they have your initials...
- Oh, wow.</i>

24:43.982 --> 24:45.775
<i>...on the inside.
I don't know.</i>

24:45.775 --> 24:47.486
<i>I just saw them.
I thought of you.</i>

24:47.486 --> 24:49.362
<i>I thought they were amazing, and</i>

24:49.362 --> 24:51.198
<i>you owe me
a fucking haircut, so...</i>

24:51.198 --> 24:53.658
<i>You're right, I do.</i>

24:53.658 --> 24:55.452
<i>I really do.</i>

24:55.452 --> 24:59.164
<i>How long
till you see me tremble?</i>

24:59.164 --> 25:02.459
<i>Take two,
can you make it memorable?</i>

25:02.459 --> 25:05.003
<i>I should move that. Yeah.</i>

25:05.003 --> 25:07.547
<i>All right.
- Mm-hmm. [grunting]</i>

25:07.547 --> 25:11.384
<i>How far can you take me,
baby?</i>

25:11.384 --> 25:14.221
<i>How far can you take?</i>

25:14.221 --> 25:16.181
<i>How far can you take me?
-</i>

25:16.181 --> 25:18.767
<i>Don't laugh at me.
I'm trying to be sexy.</i>

25:18.767 --> 25:21.186
<i>How far can you take?</i>

25:22.646 --> 25:25.315
<i>How can 911 be busy?</i>

25:25.315 --> 25:28.485
<i>It's Halloween. I mean, this is
the Super Bowl of mischief.</i>

25:28.485 --> 25:30.320
<i>We should've gone out.</i>

25:30.320 --> 25:33.490
<i>Hey. Hey, hey, hey.
Just deep breaths, okay?</i>

25:33.490 --> 25:35.116
<i>Okay.
- Breathe.</i>

25:35.116 --> 25:37.327
<i>My mother warned me.
She warned me not</i>

25:37.327 --> 25:39.162
<i>to turn my panic room
into a wine cellar.</i>

25:39.162 --> 25:40.830
<i>I should have listened.
-</i>

25:40.830 --> 25:42.874
<i>Oh, fuck, we're gonna die!</i>

25:42.874 --> 25:45.043
<i>All right, you know what?
Fuck it.</i>

25:45.043 --> 25:46.962
<i>I'm gonna go check it out. Oh.
- What?</i>

25:46.962 --> 25:48.630
<i>I can't see my own death
coming anyway,</i>

25:48.630 --> 25:50.048
<i>and if it does happen,
then you'll have time</i>

25:50.048 --> 25:51.466
<i>to run out the back.</i>

25:51.466 --> 25:53.843
<i>Taylor?</i>

25:53.843 --> 25:57.055
<i>Taylor? Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

25:57.055 --> 26:01.184
<i>Care... No.
Oh, Taylor, be care...</i>

26:01.184 --> 26:02.644
Ow!

26:02.644 --> 26:05.397
<i>Oh! Fuck. Fuck.
- Oh, fuck!</i>

26:05.397 --> 26:06.731
<i>Fuck, fuck, fuck.</i>

26:07.732 --> 26:09.359
Oh, fuck.

26:10.777 --> 26:15.240
Happy Halloween.

26:15.240 --> 26:17.409
<i>I think it came back
to haunt you.</i>

26:17.409 --> 26:19.119
<i>When we tell this story,</i>

26:19.119 --> 26:20.745
<i>we're gonna tell it
really differently.</i>

26:20.745 --> 26:22.539
<i>Oh, hell no, uh-uh.
We're telling it</i>

26:22.539 --> 26:24.082
<i>just like it happened.
- No.</i>

26:25.041 --> 26:27.586
Mmm.

26:27.586 --> 26:29.879
<i>What was that for?</i>

26:29.879 --> 26:32.924
<i>Well, you were gonna
save my life.</i>

26:32.924 --> 26:35.260
<i>Yeah. Yeah, you know what?</i>

26:35.260 --> 26:36.845
I was gonna save your life.

26:36.845 --> 26:38.430
<i>You like me.</i>

26:38.430 --> 26:40.807
<i>Of course I like you.</i>

26:41.808 --> 26:44.269
<i>You're hiding
medical emergencies from me.</i>

26:44.269 --> 26:46.271
Well, you know what?

26:46.271 --> 26:48.273
<i>I've been at your house
for three days,</i>

26:48.273 --> 26:51.109
<i>and you have never once
had anything in your teeth.</i>

26:51.109 --> 26:55.614
<i>You-you wore white pants
and ate a whole plate of nachos,</i>

26:55.614 --> 26:58.700
<i>and you didn't spill a drop.
I mean...</i>

26:58.700 --> 27:00.452
<i>who are you?</i>

27:01.453 --> 27:03.872
<i>I can show you who I am.</i>

27:03.872 --> 27:08.251
<i>I just didn't know
if we were, you know, there.</i>

27:08.251 --> 27:10.670
<i>Yeah. Exactly.</i>

27:10.670 --> 27:12.589
<i>I mean, I didn't know either.</i>

27:12.589 --> 27:14.591
<i>soft, gentle music</i>

27:16.259 --> 27:18.011
<i>But are we?
-</i>

27:18.637 --> 27:22.432
<i>You gonna let me take
that contact out of your eye?</i>

27:22.432 --> 27:24.517
<i>Oh, my God, would you, please?</i>

27:25.852 --> 27:28.605
<i>Yeah, doesn't look so good.</i>

27:33.443 --> 27:35.570
I need to go to the bathroom.

27:35.570 --> 27:37.072
<i>Okay.</i>

27:37.072 --> 27:39.282
<i>Come on, let's get you up.</i>

27:46.164 --> 27:47.749
<i>Come on.</i>

27:47.749 --> 27:49.668
<i>Oh. I can use the thing.
- The bedpan? No. Remember?</i>

27:49.668 --> 27:52.462
<i>The doctor said
that it's good for you to get up</i>

27:52.462 --> 27:53.463
<i>and move around? Oh.
- No, no, no.</i>

27:53.463 --> 27:54.923
<i>I can use the bedpan.</i>

27:54.923 --> 27:56.758
<i>No, you're not gonna use
the bedpan.</i>

27:56.758 --> 27:58.301
<i>The doctor said to get up.</i>

27:58.301 --> 28:00.345
<i>Come on, we can do this.
Come on.</i>

28:00.345 --> 28:01.805
<i>Oh. Oh, oh, oh. Oh.
- Oh, sorry.</i>

28:01.805 --> 28:04.182
<i>Oh, God. No, you can.
Come on. The doctor said</i>

28:04.182 --> 28:05.975
<i>it's good for you
to get up and move around,</i>

28:05.975 --> 28:08.812
<i>so we can, we can do this.
- Oh, stop. Stop.</i>

28:08.812 --> 28:13.066
<i>Mom, why are you fighting me?
-</i>

28:13.066 --> 28:14.984
<i>I don't want to be your patient.</i>

28:14.984 --> 28:18.071
<i>Mom, I don't mind.
- Victor! Victor?</i>

28:18.071 --> 28:19.489
<i>Yes?
- No, Victor, we're fine.</i>

28:19.489 --> 28:20.657
<i>You sure?
- We don't, we don't need Victor.</i>

28:20.657 --> 28:21.741
<i>I'm-I'm right here.</i>

28:21.741 --> 28:23.368
<i>I don't want you.</i>

28:23.368 --> 28:25.203
<i>I want Victor!</i>

28:25.203 --> 28:26.871
<i>What's going on?
- Victor, come here!</i>

28:26.871 --> 28:29.916
<i>It's... We're...
- She's trying to kill me.</i>

28:29.916 --> 28:31.167
<i>No, I'm not.</i>

28:31.167 --> 28:32.711
<i>I'm not. Okay?</i>

28:32.711 --> 28:34.671
<i>We've done this before.
We can... you know,</i>

28:34.671 --> 28:36.548
<i>I'm gonna get you up and you're
gonna go to the bathroom, okay?</i>

28:36.548 --> 28:37.966
<i>Come on.
-</i>

28:37.966 --> 28:39.551
<i>Come on. Come on.
- Oh, my God. Oh, my God.</i>

28:39.551 --> 28:41.136
<i>You need to let me go.</i>

28:41.136 --> 28:44.806
<i>Oh, oh... let me go.</i>

28:44.806 --> 28:46.307
<i>Let me go.
- Okay.</i>

28:46.307 --> 28:49.018
<i>Oh, this is not right.
- Okay, I'm sorry.</i>

28:49.018 --> 28:51.980
<i>I want to go live
in the nursing home.</i>

28:51.980 --> 28:54.232
<i>No, you... no, you don't.</i>

28:54.232 --> 28:55.859
No, you don't.

28:55.859 --> 28:57.235
<i>I know what I want,</i>

28:57.235 --> 28:58.820
<i>and it's not this.</i>

28:58.820 --> 29:01.322
<i>It's not this, Theresa.</i>

29:01.322 --> 29:03.533
<i>Um...
- It's not this.</i>

29:03.533 --> 29:06.745
<i>Okay. Okay.
- Victor. Victor.</i>

29:06.745 --> 29:09.497
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

29:09.497 --> 29:11.040
<i>She... There's a...</i>

29:11.040 --> 29:12.459
<i>I-I know.
- Okay.</i>

29:12.459 --> 29:14.627
<i>I-I saw them.
I got this.</i>

29:14.627 --> 29:16.212
<i>Okay.</i>

29:17.714 --> 29:19.966
You're good. You're okay.

29:19.966 --> 29:22.135
<i>River of words</i>

29:22.135 --> 29:24.179
<i>Bury me alive</i>

29:24.179 --> 29:26.139
<i>River of words</i>

29:26.139 --> 29:28.975
<i>Bury me alive</i>

29:36.649 --> 29:38.485
<i>Boo!
- Jesus Christ.</i>

29:40.904 --> 29:42.447
<i>You really scared me.</i>

29:42.447 --> 29:44.532
They, uh, they stripped me down

29:44.532 --> 29:46.743
<i>so you could see
a little more skin.</i>

29:46.743 --> 29:48.703
<i>Oh, did they?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

29:48.703 --> 29:50.121
Oh, my God.

29:50.121 --> 29:52.791
<i>You like it?
- Yeah, you look sexy.</i>

29:52.791 --> 29:54.626
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

29:56.127 --> 29:57.837
<i>Mmm...</i>

30:00.006 --> 30:02.050
<i>Hey.
- Hey.</i>

30:02.050 --> 30:04.803
<i>I'm sorry I didn't tell you
about Shane earlier.</i>

30:04.803 --> 30:06.805
<i>It was stupid.</i>

30:06.805 --> 30:09.474
<i>What?
Why are you doing this?</i>

30:09.474 --> 30:13.728
<i>I talked to Shane.
It's... She didn't...</i>

30:13.728 --> 30:15.271
Well, um...

30:15.271 --> 30:20.151
<i>She's probably hiding it
from you because...</i>

30:20.151 --> 30:22.111
<i>she's embarrassed
about what she did.</i>

30:22.111 --> 30:24.614
<i>I mean, she can't just
come out and say it.</i>

30:24.614 --> 30:26.115
<i>She's ashamed.</i>

30:26.115 --> 30:28.117
<i>Is that what it felt like
for you with me?</i>

30:28.117 --> 30:32.872
<i>Um... yeah. I-I guess.
I mean, still does.</i>

30:32.872 --> 30:35.291
So, why do you do it?

30:35.291 --> 30:37.210
<i>That's not something that I do.</i>

30:37.210 --> 30:39.796
<i>I mean, I have done it, but...</i>

30:39.796 --> 30:42.507
<i>I don't know about that.
- You don't know about what?</i>

30:42.507 --> 30:46.469
<i>I just mean, like, you know,
you kind of have a pattern.</i>

30:46.469 --> 30:49.848
<i>I do not have a pattern.
I made a mistake.</i>

30:49.848 --> 30:52.725
<i>You cheated on your girlfriend
before Dani, too, with Dani.</i>

30:52.725 --> 30:54.561
<i>Yeah, I was 20 years old.</i>

30:54.561 --> 30:56.354
<i>And then you slept with someone
while I was in rehab.</i>

30:56.354 --> 30:57.522
<i>It's not not a pattern.</i>

30:57.522 --> 30:59.524
<i>slow, plaintive music</i>

31:03.236 --> 31:05.363
<i>Is that what you think about?
When you think about me?</i>

31:05.363 --> 31:07.657
<i>No. Mm...</i>

31:07.657 --> 31:09.200
<i>I have to answer that again.</i>

31:09.200 --> 31:11.786
<i>Um...</i>

31:11.786 --> 31:14.247
Sometimes.

31:16.916 --> 31:19.711
<i>Wow. So this is why
we're not having sex.</i>

31:19.711 --> 31:22.171
<i>What? What does that
have to do with--</i>

31:22.171 --> 31:24.382
<i>All this fucking bullshit
is sitting</i>

31:24.382 --> 31:26.676
<i>between you and me all the time.</i>

31:26.676 --> 31:28.678
<i>And you can't see me.</i>

31:28.678 --> 31:30.847
<i>You can only see the people
that I've fucked</i>

31:30.847 --> 31:33.391
<i>and the mistakes that I've made.</i>

31:33.391 --> 31:36.060
<i>And then you look at me
like I'm fucking crazy</i>

31:36.060 --> 31:37.937
<i>for following the rules
that you made up.</i>

31:37.937 --> 31:40.899
<i>But I'm here.
I'm still here.</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:43.526
<i>And I can't do anything
but wait for you to trust me.</i>

31:43.526 --> 31:45.445
<i>So, tell me, Fin,</i>

31:45.445 --> 31:47.196
<i>when are you gonna stop
punishing me?</i>

31:47.196 --> 31:49.073
<i>I don't want to punish you.</i>

31:49.073 --> 31:50.158
<i>That's not...
- You know...</i>

31:51.826 --> 31:53.411
<i>I'm just gonna go home.</i>

31:53.411 --> 31:54.913
<i>Wow.</i>

31:57.123 --> 31:59.083
<i>pulsing, dramatic music</i>

32:09.761 --> 32:11.262
<i>Fuck.</i>

32:11.262 --> 32:13.056
<i>Here you go.
Have a great night, okay?</i>

32:13.056 --> 32:14.265
Thank you.

32:16.267 --> 32:20.021
<i>You know I feel alone
without you on my bones</i>

32:21.981 --> 32:24.067
<i>You're not leaving, are you?</i>

32:24.067 --> 32:26.277
<i>Uh, yeah. Yeah, I...</i>

32:26.277 --> 32:28.446
<i>I am.
- Damn.</i>

32:28.446 --> 32:31.741
<i>I was just gonna ask
if I could buy you a drink.</i>

32:31.741 --> 32:33.284
<i>Um...</i>

32:33.284 --> 32:38.373
<i>I have a girlfriend.
But... thank you. Really.</i>

32:39.457 --> 32:42.293
<i>Have a good night.
- Have a good night.</i>

32:42.293 --> 32:44.128
<i>On my bones, hey</i>

32:44.128 --> 32:46.923
<i>On my bones</i>

32:46.923 --> 32:54.847
<i>Run, run, run</i>

32:55.890 --> 33:00.311
<i>I can't seem to face up
to the facts</i>

33:00.311 --> 33:04.816
<i>I'm tense and nervous
and I can't relax</i>

33:04.816 --> 33:08.945
<i>I can't sleep
'cause my bed's on fire</i>

33:08.945 --> 33:13.908
<i>Don't touch me,
I'm a real live wire</i>

33:13.908 --> 33:17.328
<i>Psycho killer,

<i>Run, run, run away</i>

33:28.673 --> 33:33.094
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

33:33.094 --> 33:35.847
<i>Ay-ya-ya-ya, ooh</i>

33:47.025 --> 33:51.362
<i>We are vain
and we are blind</i>

33:51.362 --> 33:54.991
<i>I hate people
when they're not polite</i>

33:54.991 --> 33:57.827
<i>Oh, oh, oh, oh</i>

33:57.827 --> 34:00.204
<i>Ay-ya-ya-ya, ooh</i>

Thanks for coming.

34:05.501 --> 34:06.627
Hey, thanks for having us, Max.

34:06.627 --> 34:07.879
<i>See you, buddy.
- Thanks.</i>

34:07.879 --> 34:08.755
Good night. See you soon.

34:08.755 --> 34:09.839
Hi.

34:09.839 --> 34:10.715
Oh, hey. Great.

34:10.715 --> 34:12.467
<i>You guys are still here.</i>

34:12.467 --> 34:15.219
<i>Yeah. Yeah, uh, well,
Maribel had to call it a night.</i>

34:15.219 --> 34:18.723
<i>But, um... I still have,</i>

34:18.723 --> 34:21.225
<i>like, a laundry list of
questions about parenting</i>

34:21.225 --> 34:22.894
<i>and I just thought,
well, maybe you're open to it,</i>

34:22.894 --> 34:25.563
<i>and if you weren't too tired,
we could grab a beer</i>

34:25.563 --> 34:26.981
<i>and you could answer some more?</i>

34:26.981 --> 34:28.524
<i>Sure. I'd love to.
- Yeah? Awesome.</i>

34:28.524 --> 34:30.693
<i>Definitely.
- Thank you. It's, um...</i>

34:30.693 --> 34:33.071
<i>I don't know, I-I-I know
that we don't really...</i>

34:33.071 --> 34:36.908
<i>know each other,
but, um... this is...</i>

34:36.908 --> 34:38.743
<i>It's special. This.</i>

34:38.743 --> 34:41.829
<i>Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
Exactly. It is.</i>

34:41.829 --> 34:43.873
<i>I mean, it is for me, too.</i>

34:43.873 --> 34:45.917
<i>Really?
- Yeah.</i>

34:45.917 --> 34:47.627
<i>'Cause I'm the one
who gets to tell you</i>

34:47.627 --> 34:49.087
<i>how great it's gonna be.</i>

34:49.087 --> 34:50.630
<i>Your whole life.</i>

34:50.630 --> 34:53.216
<i>You get to reinvent
everything for yourself</i>

34:53.216 --> 34:55.593
<i>and be your own kind of...</i>

34:55.593 --> 34:57.970
<i>your own kind of parent
and your own kind of man.</i>

35:00.098 --> 35:03.309
<i>Yeah, I'm excited for you.</i>

35:03.309 --> 35:05.812
<i>Wow.</i>

35:05.812 --> 35:08.815
<i>Uh... it's a, it's a little
harder to cry now, on "T," but--</i>

35:08.815 --> 35:10.775
<i>Oh, yeah. I know that.</i>

35:13.903 --> 35:15.947
<i>So glad to meet you.</i>

35:15.947 --> 35:18.699
<i>I appreciate that.
- Let me just make sure</i>

35:18.699 --> 35:21.119
<i>Reese is all good with the kids
and then we'll head out.</i>

35:21.119 --> 35:22.245
<i>Sound good?</i>

35:22.245 --> 35:23.621
<i>Sure. That sounds perfect.</i>

35:23.621 --> 35:25.957
<i>Awesome. I'll be right back.
- Okay.</i>

35:39.887 --> 35:41.681
Hey.

35:50.982 --> 35:53.151
I trusted you.

35:53.151 --> 35:56.487
<i>I defended you. I just, I...</i>

35:58.156 --> 35:59.532
<i>I don't know
who you are anymore.</i>

35:59.532 --> 36:01.659
<i>It's like...</i>

36:01.659 --> 36:03.536
<i>Tess is fucking perfect, man.</i>

36:03.536 --> 36:05.538
<i>Mm.
- And when I see you two,</i>

36:05.538 --> 36:06.873
<i>I'm like,
"Holy shit, that's it.</i>

36:06.873 --> 36:08.457
<i>That's-that's,
that is what I want.</i>

36:08.457 --> 36:10.209
<i>That makes perfect sense."</i>

36:10.209 --> 36:12.920
<i>And then you have to go
shit all over it.</i>

36:12.920 --> 36:15.089
<i>I saw you, Shane.</i>

36:15.089 --> 36:16.340
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

36:16.340 --> 36:19.677
<i>I got to... get out of here.</i>

36:19.677 --> 36:21.095
<i>I looked up to you,</i>

36:21.095 --> 36:22.388
<i>and you're a real fucking disappointment.</i>

36:30.897 --> 36:32.857
<i>upbeat, percussive music</i>

36:39.572 --> 36:42.658
<i>Hey.</i>

36:42.658 --> 36:44.202
<i>You like the view?</i>

36:44.202 --> 36:46.621
<i>It's not bad, not bad.</i>

36:56.214 --> 36:58.341
<i>If I tell you I want you</i>

36:58.341 --> 37:00.593
<i>It don't mean
that I need you</i>

37:00.593 --> 37:02.845
<i>I'm the hand
that can feed you</i>

37:02.845 --> 37:04.889
<i>And you know I'm-a feed you</i>

37:04.889 --> 37:06.766
<i>I'm making big waves now</i>

37:06.766 --> 37:08.726
<i>Parting the seas
on the way down</i>

37:08.726 --> 37:10.686
<i>I'm polishing my crown</i>

37:10.686 --> 37:13.648
<i>Show some respect, boy,
and bow down</i>

37:13.648 --> 37:16.317
<i>My body is a temple</i>

37:16.317 --> 37:18.861
<i>Assume your position...</i>

37:18.861 --> 37:21.781
<i>The view is even nicer
than I thought.</i>

37:23.616 --> 37:25.493
<i>My mind is influential</i>

37:25.493 --> 37:28.037
<i>Make me your religion</i>

37:28.037 --> 37:30.081
<i>And show me how you worship</i>

37:36.462 --> 37:39.423
<i>Let me see you worship</i>

37:39.423 --> 37:41.592
<i>Meow.
-</i>

37:43.928 --> 37:48.099
<i>Show me how you worship</i>

37:48.099 --> 37:49.767
<i>You say I'm so good,
oh, my goodness</i>

37:49.767 --> 37:51.894
<i>You treat me
like I am a goddess</i>

37:51.894 --> 37:53.521
<i>Ah. Ow.
- Oh.</i>

37:53.521 --> 37:55.523
I'm sorry. You okay?

37:55.523 --> 38:00.820
<i>Yeah. This, uh...
this earring.... it stuck me.</i>

38:02.238 --> 38:03.739
<i>It's all good.</i>

38:04.824 --> 38:07.660
<i>Do you want to put
some music on? What's up?</i>

38:07.660 --> 38:08.995
<i>Uh...</i>

38:10.371 --> 38:12.415
<i>Sorry.
- You okay?</i>

38:12.415 --> 38:14.959
<i>What's going on?</i>

38:14.959 --> 38:17.086
<i>Um, I...</i>

38:18.963 --> 38:22.883
<i>I think I'm, I think I'm still
in love with my ex-girlfriend.</i>

38:22.883 --> 38:24.302
<i>Shit.</i>

38:25.803 --> 38:29.223
<i>Sorry.
- Okay.</i>

38:29.223 --> 38:32.101
<i>Um... it's okay, man.</i>

38:33.019 --> 38:33.978
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

38:33.978 --> 38:35.813
<i>Oh, honey.</i>

38:38.441 --> 38:40.318
<i>Have you cried about it yet?
- No.</i>

38:40.318 --> 38:42.320
No? Oh, okay, here.

38:42.320 --> 38:44.572
<i>Put my leg around you.</i>

38:44.572 --> 38:46.657
<i>Come here.
You got to let it out.</i>

38:46.657 --> 38:48.617
<i>Come on.
-</i>

38:48.617 --> 38:49.785
Let it out.

38:53.706 --> 38:55.750
<i>What's wrong with me?</i>

38:57.460 --> 38:59.003
Nothing.

38:59.003 --> 39:01.088
<i>There's nothing wrong with you.</i>

39:02.298 --> 39:04.842
<i>It's okay, baby.
-</i>

39:07.428 --> 39:09.055
<i>Is this what you imagined
it would be like</i>

39:09.055 --> 39:11.182
<i>for our first time hooking up?</i>

39:11.182 --> 39:13.059
<i>Oh, oh, yeah.</i>

39:13.059 --> 39:14.643
<i>The snot's a bit extra.</i>

39:14.643 --> 39:16.854
Ew.

39:18.064 --> 39:20.358
<i>God, you feel so good.</i>

39:20.358 --> 39:22.735
<i>I know, these are
the best kind of hugs.</i>

39:22.735 --> 39:25.363
<i>Arms and legs.
-</i>

39:25.363 --> 39:27.073
<i>Thank you.</i>

39:31.243 --> 39:33.496
<i>How's the eye?
- It's good.</i>

39:34.747 --> 39:36.707
<i>Oh, it's actually better.
- Oh, good.</i>

39:36.707 --> 39:38.417
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:38.417 --> 39:40.378
<i>What do you got?
- Okay.</i>

39:40.378 --> 39:43.255
<i>Ready? Um, all right.</i>

39:44.507 --> 39:45.883
<i>I have to wear this every night</i>

39:45.883 --> 39:47.843
<i>because I grind
the shit out of my teeth.</i>

39:47.843 --> 39:49.220
<i>So...</i>

39:49.220 --> 39:52.139
<i>Okay. All right,
that's not a bad start.</i>

39:52.139 --> 39:53.140
<i>Need more?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

39:53.140 --> 39:54.141
<i>Okay.
-</i>

39:54.141 --> 39:56.811
<i>Mm-hmm. Got it.</i>

39:56.811 --> 39:59.522
<i>I have to wear these sometimes</i>

39:59.522 --> 40:01.399
<i>because my neighbor decided
to sell their house</i>

40:01.399 --> 40:03.067
<i>to the drummer of Maroon 5.</i>

40:03.067 --> 40:05.403
<i>And I know everyone loves
that band, but I'm not a fan.</i>

40:05.403 --> 40:07.363
<i>I'm gonna need some of those.</i>

40:07.363 --> 40:11.033
<i>What else do I have?
So many things wrong with me.</i>

40:11.033 --> 40:12.827
<i>Mm-hmm.
- Oh, I know.</i>

40:12.827 --> 40:15.913
<i>Um, when I'm really
stressed out,</i>

40:15.913 --> 40:19.959
<i>I have to watch clips
of The Voice Australia.</i>

40:19.959 --> 40:22.420
<i>Okay.
-</i>

40:22.420 --> 40:24.588
<i>I know that it's really</i>

40:24.588 --> 40:26.465
<i>not good for
the environment and all, but...</i>

40:26.465 --> 40:27.716
<i>Oh... what?</i>

40:27.716 --> 40:30.428
I love Styrofoam cups.

40:30.428 --> 40:32.096
<i>Oh, I kind of unders...
- Yeah. Yeah.</i>

40:32.096 --> 40:34.432
<i>Yeah. I get it. I get it.</i>

40:34.432 --> 40:36.058
<i>I don't have a driver's license.</i>

40:36.058 --> 40:37.393
<i>What?
- Mm-mm.</i>

40:37.393 --> 40:38.477
<i>Oh, we... Oh, wait.
No. No. Mm-mm.</i>

40:38.477 --> 40:41.021
<i>What?
- No. One sec.</i>

40:44.650 --> 40:47.111
<i>Okay, I'm ready.
- Yeah, you are.</i>

40:54.994 --> 40:57.037
<i>I'm a little strange</i>

40:57.037 --> 40:58.998
<i>Got poison in my veins
-</i>

40:58.998 --> 41:02.460
<i>They don't know
who they're talking to</i>

41:02.460 --> 41:05.921
<i>I'm a, I'm a, I'm a</i>

41:05.921 --> 41:08.799
<i>I'm a mad</i>

41:08.799 --> 41:11.177
<i>Madwoman</i>

41:12.595 --> 41:14.638
<i>Madwoman</i>

41:17.183 --> 41:18.642
Shane?

41:18.642 --> 41:20.561
<i>Max.
- Hey.</i>

41:20.561 --> 41:24.273
<i>Oh, my God, Max.
How you doing?</i>

41:24.273 --> 41:25.941
<i>I'm great.
- Wow, hi.</i>

41:25.941 --> 41:28.027
<i>It's-it's wild to see you here.</i>

41:28.027 --> 41:29.278
<i>This is my place.</i>

41:29.278 --> 41:30.821
<i>It is?
- Yeah.</i>

41:30.821 --> 41:32.490
<i>It's so nice. Wow.
- Thank you.</i>

41:32.490 --> 41:34.325
<i>I'm so happy to see you
doing so well.</i>

41:34.325 --> 41:36.118
<i>Yeah, what has it been?</i>

41:36.118 --> 41:38.287
<i>Uh, I mean,
what are we going on?</i>

41:38.287 --> 41:39.788
<i>Twelve, 13 years?
- Yeah.</i>

41:39.788 --> 41:41.165
<i>About that.</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:42.958
<i>I've-I've...
so much has happened.</i>

41:42.958 --> 41:44.627
<i>I feel like I've lived
a thousand lives</i>

41:44.627 --> 41:45.669
<i>since I've seen you last.</i>

41:45.669 --> 41:47.630
<i>Well, all good ones, I hope.</i>

41:47.630 --> 41:48.797
<i>Yeah.</i>

41:48.797 --> 41:50.633
<i>I've got four kids.
- What?</i>

41:50.633 --> 41:52.843
<i>You have four kids?
Are you serious?</i>

41:52.843 --> 41:56.305
<i>Yeah. It's a madhouse for sure.
But... It's so joyful.</i>

41:56.305 --> 41:58.015
<i>Wow.
- What about you?</i>

41:58.015 --> 42:01.018
<i>Did you settle down
or are you still being Shane?</i>

42:02.019 --> 42:02.978
<i>Oh...</i>

42:04.438 --> 42:07.608
<i>Yeah. No, no, no.
No, I'm not.</i>

42:07.608 --> 42:11.111
<i>I-I-I have a girl.
You know? She's-she's great.</i>

42:11.111 --> 42:12.363
<i>That's great.
- She's great.</i>

42:12.363 --> 42:14.949
<i>I'm happy for you.
- Thank you.</i>

42:14.949 --> 42:16.534
<i>And it seems like
you've changed a lot,</i>

42:16.534 --> 42:18.369
<i>which is... it's cool to see.</i>

42:20.246 --> 42:22.957
<i>So for what it's worth...</i>

42:22.957 --> 42:24.875
<i>just want to apologize.</i>

42:24.875 --> 42:27.378
<i>For how we were back then.</i>

42:27.378 --> 42:28.712
<i>I'm great, man.</i>

42:28.712 --> 42:31.173
<i>Good.
- I'm happy and...</i>

42:31.173 --> 42:32.591
<i>I hope you're happy, too.</i>

42:32.591 --> 42:34.760
<i>I'm trying.</i>

42:34.760 --> 42:37.012
<i>Good to see you, Max.
Really good to see you.</i>

42:37.012 --> 42:39.682
<i>Listen, anything
you'd like tonight, please.</i>

42:39.682 --> 42:42.059
<i>On the house, all right?
- Good to see you.</i>

42:43.477 --> 42:45.563
<i>You, uh, you two know
each other?</i>

42:45.563 --> 42:47.398
<i>Yeah. I mean, we used to.</i>

42:47.398 --> 42:48.774
<i>Yeah.
- Small world.</i>

42:48.774 --> 42:50.192
<i>Uh, here.
- Thanks.</i>

42:50.192 --> 42:51.735
<i>I, uh, just had
a few more questions</i>

42:51.735 --> 42:53.237
<i>if you've got some time still.
- Sure, yeah.</i>

42:53.237 --> 42:54.446
<i>Yeah?
- Should we sit down?</i>

42:54.446 --> 42:55.906
<i>Yeah, that'd be great. Thanks.</i>

42:55.906 --> 42:57.866
<i>All right, what...
So, what do you got?</i>

42:57.866 --> 42:59.618
<i>Well, uh, so,
with the diapers...</i>

42:59.618 --> 43:01.245
<i>how do you know
when to change them?</i>

43:01.245 --> 43:02.454
<i>Like, just
when they smell or...?</i>

43:02.454 --> 43:05.583
You know... listen.

43:05.583 --> 43:07.209
<i>First off,</i>

43:07.209 --> 43:09.253
<i>can I tell you something
that I wish I'd have known?</i>

43:09.253 --> 43:11.422
<i>Yeah, yeah, God.
Anything. Please.</i>

43:11.422 --> 43:14.592
<i>Just don't forget
to have fun, too. Okay?</i>

43:14.592 --> 43:16.510
<i>Okay.
- What else?</i>

43:16.510 --> 43:18.887
<i>Uh, well, okay,
this one sounds stupid,</i>

43:18.887 --> 43:20.222
<i>but I'm, like,
I'm genuinely worried.</i>

43:20.222 --> 43:21.515
<i>Like, what if the kid is weird?</i>

43:26.103 --> 43:30.190
<i>Ugh, fuck
this city on Halloween.</i>

43:30.190 --> 43:32.026
Rough night?

43:32.026 --> 43:35.946
<i>I spent two hours
waiting for an accessible Lyft.</i>

43:35.946 --> 43:38.824
<i>Where's Micah?
- Oh, he's talking to a real</i>

43:38.824 --> 43:41.493
<i>smartass who told me
to resolve my daddy issues</i>

43:41.493 --> 43:44.288
<i>before I have a baby.
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

43:46.749 --> 43:48.292
<i>Wait, is there
SweeTarts in there?</i>

43:48.292 --> 43:50.502
<i>Yeah. Um...</i>

43:51.837 --> 43:53.339
Yes.

43:53.339 --> 43:55.841
<i>Do you think I'm like Dad?</i>

43:55.841 --> 43:58.093
<i>Fuck, I hope not.</i>

43:58.093 --> 43:59.803
<i>I'm serious.
-</i>

43:59.803 --> 44:02.306
<i>Do you think I'm, like...</i>

44:02.306 --> 44:03.766
<i>a cheater?</i>

44:05.434 --> 44:07.019
<i>I mean, you do have a pattern.</i>

44:07.019 --> 44:08.270
<i>Oh, my God.
- What?</i>

44:08.270 --> 44:09.647
<i>That's exactly what Finley said.</i>

44:09.647 --> 44:12.107
<i>Whoa, okay, that is
the only thing</i>

44:12.107 --> 44:14.318
<i>Finley and I have in common.
-</i>

44:14.318 --> 44:17.279
<i>I fucking love her.</i>

44:17.279 --> 44:19.615
<i>I know you do.</i>

44:19.615 --> 44:22.159
<i>You know, and I don't want
to be like Dad.</i>

44:22.159 --> 44:24.662
<i>Can you believe
that bastard just left us?</i>

44:24.662 --> 44:26.747
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

44:26.747 --> 44:28.832
<i>They all leave.
Fuck 'em.</i>

44:34.713 --> 44:35.964
But not Micah.

44:35.964 --> 44:37.966
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

44:37.966 --> 44:42.346
<i>Micah is not Dad, okay?</i>

44:42.346 --> 44:45.891
<i>Micah is...</i>

44:45.891 --> 44:51.146
<i>...is a kind,
sweet, anxious...</i>

44:51.146 --> 44:54.483
...perfect person.

44:54.483 --> 44:56.860
<i>He ain't ever gonna leave you.</i>

44:56.860 --> 44:58.821
<i>Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

44:58.821 --> 45:01.073
<i>You could be
nicer to him sometimes.</i>
