00:02.036 --> 00:04.036
("Lovely Day" plays)

00:04.038 --> 00:07.106
¶¶

00:35.836 --> 00:37.369
Stan!

00:37.371 --> 00:40.639
You got to clean
this goddamn patio!

00:40.641 --> 00:44.843
¶ A lovely day ¶

00:44.845 --> 00:47.012
Stan, I need you
to sign this permission slip

00:47.014 --> 00:48.814
for a school trip.
Well, I'm a little busy

00:48.816 --> 00:50.849
getting 20 years of crap
off the patio.

00:50.851 --> 00:53.152
Is Brett Ratner's career
on the patio?

00:53.154 --> 00:54.753
Oh-ho-ho!
Burn!

00:54.755 --> 00:56.855
Tell you what --
You sign my permission slip,

00:56.857 --> 00:58.891
and I'll loan you
my power washer.

00:58.893 --> 01:00.859
You think it's strong enough
to do the job?

01:00.861 --> 01:03.362
Let's just say
the Statue of Liberty

01:03.364 --> 01:05.064
uses it to shower...

01:05.066 --> 01:07.199
which she doesn't do often,
'cause she's French.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.034
B-B-B-B-Burn!

01:09.036 --> 01:10.436
You know
that's paint thinner.

01:10.438 --> 01:13.238
Yeah, nice try.
I'm not going anywhere.

01:17.244 --> 01:20.079
I souped it up
with a little alien tech.

01:20.081 --> 01:22.214
By alien,
I mean Detroit.

01:22.216 --> 01:24.249
Let's turn
this country around.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.752
Let's make things again.

01:26.754 --> 01:28.420
(engine starts)

01:28.422 --> 01:30.456
(rumbling)
Whoa!

01:30.458 --> 01:32.758
Whoa! Roger!

01:32.760 --> 01:34.726
(screaming)

01:34.728 --> 01:37.129
Nice, huh?
No, shut it off!

01:40.468 --> 01:43.135
(engine shuts off)
Damn it, Roger!

01:43.137 --> 01:45.971
Not used to holding a tool
with that kind of power, Stan?

01:45.973 --> 01:47.306
(laughs)
I'm kidding.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.640
I've seen yours
while you were sleeping.

01:48.642 --> 01:49.908
It's great.

01:49.910 --> 01:51.577
Oh...
Oh...

01:51.579 --> 01:52.811
...my...
...my...

01:52.813 --> 01:54.313
...God.
...God.

01:54.315 --> 01:56.915
Jinx! Now you can't talk
till I say your name, Stan.

01:56.917 --> 01:58.383
Ah, damn it!

01:58.385 --> 02:01.086
¶¶

02:01.088 --> 02:03.589
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:03.591 --> 02:07.426
¶ I got a feelin' that
it's gonna be a wonderful day ¶

02:07.428 --> 02:10.629
¶ The sun in the sky
has a smile on his face ¶

02:10.631 --> 02:14.867
¶ And he's shinin' a salute
to the American race ¶

02:16.737 --> 02:20.139
¶ Oh, boy, it's swell to say ¶

02:20.141 --> 02:22.341
¶ Good -- ¶
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:22.343 --> 02:23.675
Aah!

02:25.112 --> 02:28.347
¶ Good morning, U.S.A. ¶

02:28.349 --> 02:30.849
¶¶

02:30.851 --> 02:32.584
What the hell is that?

02:32.586 --> 02:33.852
What's going on?!

02:33.854 --> 02:36.088
You burning
some punk-ass fools?

02:36.090 --> 02:38.824
Do Hayley next.
The yard!

02:38.826 --> 02:40.459
(stammering)

02:40.461 --> 02:42.794
Stan was cleaning the patio
with my power washer,

02:42.796 --> 02:44.463
and it kind of
got away from him.

02:44.465 --> 02:46.832
Because it has a Trans Am engine
strapped to it.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.267
You used to be stronger.

02:48.269 --> 02:49.835
But, look.
Stan struck something.

02:49.837 --> 02:51.370
White, dusty oil?

02:51.372 --> 02:52.437
Lawn dandruff?

02:52.439 --> 02:54.006
A third ridiculous guess?

02:54.008 --> 02:57.109
I think
I know what this is.

03:02.383 --> 03:03.649
Yep, that's salt.

03:03.651 --> 03:05.117
It's a salt deposit.

03:05.119 --> 03:06.618
Oh, my God!

03:06.620 --> 03:08.220
Did you guys
think it was cocaine?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.856
Cocaine doesn't grow
underground, dumb-asses.

03:10.858 --> 03:13.225
You got to make that shit,
with blood and sweat.

03:13.227 --> 03:14.826
And a little bit of salt.

03:14.828 --> 03:17.129
You got to cut it with salt
to hit your margins.

03:17.131 --> 03:19.631
So I guess
we have 1% of cocaine here.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.400
And a big mess
to clean up.

03:21.402 --> 03:22.968
This isn't a mess.

03:22.970 --> 03:24.636
This could be
our future.

03:24.638 --> 03:27.206
Is salt valuable?

03:27.208 --> 03:30.576
I don't know.

03:33.981 --> 03:35.747
¶¶

03:35.749 --> 03:37.316
No way.

03:37.318 --> 03:39.551
Wendy Williams could totally
beat up Connie Chung.

03:39.553 --> 03:41.386
Sure, sure,
but, I mean, no one was talking

03:41.388 --> 03:43.222
about either of those people
before you said that.

03:43.224 --> 03:45.824
(door closes)
I spoke
to the Gordon Salt people,

03:45.826 --> 03:48.227
and they said we
might have a valuable
resource in our yard.

03:48.229 --> 03:51.163
And if we do, they'd like to pay
us for the right to take it.

03:51.165 --> 03:52.698
You mean mine it,
like minerals?

03:52.700 --> 03:55.167
Ha. If you want to talk
like a ground scientist.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.501
A geologist?
What?

03:56.503 --> 03:57.903
Wait, honey.

03:57.905 --> 04:01.240
You want a functioning salt mine
in our backyard?

04:01.242 --> 04:03.775
Well, I sure as heck don't want
a non-functioning one.

04:03.777 --> 04:05.744
Stan, it's our yard.

04:05.746 --> 04:07.045
Our sanctuary.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.280
Our happy place.

04:08.282 --> 04:09.948
We used to have
treasure hunts

04:09.950 --> 04:12.451
where you'd write clues for me
and hide them around the yard.

04:12.453 --> 04:13.952
I know we're a family,

04:13.954 --> 04:15.587
so we usually pretend
everyone gets a vote.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.190
But, come on, guys.
It's me.

04:18.192 --> 04:19.925
I'm gonna do what I want.
(doorbell rings)

04:19.927 --> 04:22.194
And I want
to see who that is.

04:23.964 --> 04:25.964
Mr. Smith,
we're with Gordon Salt.

04:25.966 --> 04:27.733
Wow.
You got here quick.

04:27.735 --> 04:32.337
There was a police chase on 95,
so we just drafted off that.

04:39.079 --> 04:40.779
Good news, Mr. Smith --

04:40.781 --> 04:43.749
A big shaft here would tap
into a significant vein of salt.

04:43.751 --> 04:45.117
Hear that?

04:45.119 --> 04:47.452
I'm gonna have
a big veiny shaft.

04:47.454 --> 04:49.721
Are they salt executives
or genies?

04:49.723 --> 04:51.556
(laughing) Oh!

04:51.558 --> 04:53.725
KLAUS:
Did I miss a burn?

04:53.727 --> 04:55.160
Please, excuse my family.

04:55.162 --> 04:56.628
They have some concerns

04:56.630 --> 04:58.497
about what exactly
is going to happen here.

04:58.499 --> 05:01.266
(chuckles)
Let me put you folks at ease.

05:01.268 --> 05:04.236
Mr. Smith here will sign
his mineral rights over to us,

05:04.238 --> 05:06.405
and we'll give him
a big check.

05:06.407 --> 05:08.507
Then we'll tear up your yard,
take all the salt out,

05:08.509 --> 05:10.175
and fill in the hole
when we're done...

05:10.177 --> 05:11.443
if there's time...

05:11.445 --> 05:12.944
which there won't be.

05:12.946 --> 05:15.681
As long as there's time
to write that big check.

05:15.683 --> 05:17.516
Mom, why are you
switching sides?

05:17.518 --> 05:20.952
Because now there's a side
that has a big check on it.

05:20.954 --> 05:24.756
And just to be clear, you mean
a physically huge check?

05:24.758 --> 05:26.992
I've always wanted
to hold one of those.

05:26.994 --> 05:29.194
Feel like
I won a golf tournament

05:29.196 --> 05:32.464
or I'm a landlord and one
of my tenants is a giant.

05:32.466 --> 05:34.533
If you're looking
to buy our mineral rights,

05:34.535 --> 05:39.338
you best be talking to me --
Steve, the legal owner.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.940
(all gasp)
I also have big news.

05:41.942 --> 05:44.776
One of these guys stepped
in dog turd on the way in.

05:44.778 --> 05:48.447
There's size-9 poo spots
all over the house.

05:52.052 --> 05:53.852
¶¶

05:53.854 --> 05:55.721
Here's where I keep
all my important documents --

05:55.723 --> 05:57.522
Big Wheel warranty,

05:57.524 --> 06:01.059
construction schematics
for my Lego<i> Millennium Falcon,</i>

06:01.061 --> 06:03.195
Barry's do-not-resuscitate
order.

06:03.197 --> 06:05.197
Ah! This!

06:05.199 --> 06:08.233
Um, can you get your shoes
off my duvet, please?

06:09.536 --> 06:12.404
This is a contract,
signed eight years ago,

06:12.406 --> 06:15.640
transferring all mineral rights
on our property from Dad to me.

06:15.642 --> 06:17.209
How is that possible?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.411
Oh.
I can explain.

06:19.413 --> 06:21.346
Uh-Uh! You think
I brought you to my room

06:21.348 --> 06:23.248
so you could do
the talking?

06:23.250 --> 06:25.917
"Your scavenger hunt
has come to an end.

06:25.919 --> 06:28.553
Your very last clue
is on the ladder, my schmend."

06:28.555 --> 06:30.021
"Schmend"?

06:30.023 --> 06:32.190
Wouldn't "friend"
have been the perfect rhyme?

06:32.192 --> 06:34.726
You have a lot to learn
about schmendship.

06:36.363 --> 06:39.197
(laughing) Ooh!
Treasure!

06:39.199 --> 06:40.732
No, Steve,
those aren't the treasure.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.434
They're just
the clue holder-downers.

06:42.436 --> 06:43.568
But they're so shiny.

06:43.570 --> 06:44.936
So is Hayley's forehead,

06:44.938 --> 06:46.304
but you wouldn't call that
a treasure.

06:50.177 --> 06:51.710
(sighing) Oh.

06:51.712 --> 06:54.045
"Down the slide
and in the ground,

06:54.047 --> 06:56.815
your special treasure
you'll have found."

06:58.218 --> 06:59.284
Ha ha!

07:01.955 --> 07:03.588
Treasure!

07:03.590 --> 07:04.756
No,
that's just more rocks.

07:04.758 --> 07:05.924
Oh, for God's sake.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.426
<i> That's</i> the treasure.

07:09.930 --> 07:12.197
Baseball cards.

07:12.199 --> 07:13.799
(unenthusiastically)
Thanks, Dad.

07:13.801 --> 07:15.500
Well, open 'em.
Let's see who you got.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.404
Must be
some kind of mistake.

07:19.406 --> 07:20.906
They're all the same card.

07:20.908 --> 07:22.140
No variety.

07:22.142 --> 07:24.476
Not like the rocks.

07:24.478 --> 07:26.978
Oh, my God!

07:26.980 --> 07:29.581
They're all Ken Griffey Jr.
rookie cards.

07:29.583 --> 07:31.116
They must be worth
a fortune.

07:31.118 --> 07:34.052
Francine, what have you
always wanted to buy?

07:34.054 --> 07:36.455
FRANCINE: We keep putting off
that procedure on my hip.

07:36.457 --> 07:38.390
Right!
A fan boat!

07:38.392 --> 07:39.958
Mwah!
Um, Dad?

07:39.960 --> 07:41.593
Isn't that<i> my</i> treasure?

07:41.595 --> 07:43.261
Technically, yes.

07:43.263 --> 07:46.565
But wouldn't you rather have all
the rocks in the whole yard?

07:46.567 --> 07:47.966
That would be awesome!

07:47.968 --> 07:49.668
But how would
I get them all out?

07:49.670 --> 07:51.970
You don't have to.

07:51.972 --> 07:55.073
You see, Steve,
owning land can be different

07:55.075 --> 07:58.009
than owning the minerals
inside that land.

07:58.011 --> 08:00.145
So now you have
the mineral rights.

08:00.147 --> 08:02.514
And all I have
are these pieces of cardboard.

08:02.516 --> 08:04.416
Sucker!

08:04.418 --> 08:06.318
Okay, you're making me
look bad, Steve.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.986
'Cause after
you called me a sucker,

08:07.988 --> 08:09.654
I definitely threw you
in the pool,

08:09.656 --> 08:10.789
'cause I don't take
that shit.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.257
Nor should you.

08:12.259 --> 08:14.192
But we're really more
concerned with the contract.

08:14.194 --> 08:16.495
Please. That can't
possibly be legally binding.

08:16.497 --> 08:18.363
I thought
you might say that...

08:18.365 --> 08:20.665
which is why I went down
to city hall this morning

08:20.667 --> 08:22.200
and got it stamped.

08:22.202 --> 08:24.703
Hmm.
Yep, it's official.

08:24.705 --> 08:29.407
And if anyone knows what's
"official," it's a fish, y'all!

08:35.849 --> 08:38.717
Look, we're here on business,
and you, young man,

08:38.719 --> 08:41.186
are the person we should be
doing business with.

08:41.188 --> 08:43.989
So there's still
a big check.

08:43.991 --> 08:45.557
It's just for Steve...

08:45.559 --> 08:47.826
my favorite boy.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.194
<i> Our</i> favorite boy.

08:49.196 --> 08:50.795
Put 'er there, son.

08:50.797 --> 08:52.664
Psych!
Whoo!

08:52.666 --> 08:54.799
No deal, mister.

08:54.801 --> 08:57.135
Eight years ago,
my dad tried to rip me off.

08:57.137 --> 08:59.137
Well, now<i> I'm</i> the one
who's gonna do the ripping --

08:59.139 --> 09:00.338
and the tearing.

09:00.340 --> 09:01.806
The ripping and the tearing,

09:01.808 --> 09:04.976
right through his plan
to destroy our backyard.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.245
<i> My</i> backyard.
My minerals.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.881
Listen, Jeremy, is it?
Steve.

09:09.883 --> 09:12.751
I respect the sexual frustration
behind your decision.

09:12.753 --> 09:14.419
What?! No, no.
That's not why I --

09:14.421 --> 09:15.687
You're obviously a virgin.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.088
That has nothing
to do with --

09:17.090 --> 09:18.590
But here's the thing,
Jer-bear --

09:18.592 --> 09:22.661
Gordon always gets its salt.

09:30.771 --> 09:32.737
<i> He's</i> the virgin.

09:32.739 --> 09:34.039
Not even close!

09:34.041 --> 09:35.874
I've had sex
with lots of girls.

09:35.876 --> 09:37.442
Name one.

09:41.548 --> 09:44.049
(school bell rings)

09:44.051 --> 09:46.284
Hi.
Hey.

09:46.286 --> 09:48.720
What's that?
It's a Lego
<i>Millennium Falcon --</i>

09:48.722 --> 09:51.623
minus a floor panel,
which I'm [Sighs]

09:51.625 --> 09:53.758
praying
fell behind my trundle bed.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.860
'Cause without it,
Han and Chewie are screwed

09:55.862 --> 09:57.429
when they need to hide
from Imperial troops.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.763
They'd just be sitting

09:58.765 --> 10:01.600
in a wide-open smuggler's hatch
like idiots.

10:01.602 --> 10:04.736
You're fun
and interesting.
I am?!

10:04.738 --> 10:05.870
Want to go out some time?

10:05.872 --> 10:07.138
Um, sure!

10:07.140 --> 10:08.707
I'm Steve.
What's your name?

10:08.709 --> 10:09.874
Whatever you want it to be.

10:09.876 --> 10:11.543
Franci-- Hold on.

10:11.545 --> 10:13.578
This is
all going too easily.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.981
Wait.
You look familiar.

10:15.983 --> 10:19.985
Yellow raincoat, box of salt
leaking on your shoes...

10:19.987 --> 10:21.553
blue umbrella!
(gasps)

10:21.555 --> 10:23.221
You're
the Gordon Salt Girl!

10:23.223 --> 10:24.723
MAN:
And she can be yours.

10:24.725 --> 10:27.125
All you have to do is
sign over the mineral rights.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.127
I already told you -- No.

10:29.129 --> 10:33.331
Seriously. She'll do
anything you want, or...

10:33.333 --> 10:35.667
<i> I'll</i> do
anything you want?

10:35.669 --> 10:37.102
Stop.

10:37.104 --> 10:39.170
You two may be dead inside,
but I'm not.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.640
I'm alive --
with family memories

10:41.642 --> 10:44.409
of barbecues
and trying sports

10:44.411 --> 10:46.845
and sweet, lazy
Sunday afternoons.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.246
Mr. Smith!

10:48.248 --> 10:49.681
Sorry.
It's just these people are --

10:49.683 --> 10:52.417
Are you playing with Legos
in my class?

10:52.419 --> 10:54.619
I'm doing a build,
if that's what you're asking.

10:54.621 --> 10:56.121
It's distracting.

10:56.123 --> 10:58.523
So are the two adult strangers
in your class.

10:58.525 --> 11:00.091
Nice try, Steve.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.260
But us adults
stick together.

11:04.164 --> 11:06.665
(somber music plays)

11:06.667 --> 11:08.433
(door closes)
Long day.

11:08.435 --> 11:09.701
(sighs) Yeah.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.369
The Gordon people
were all over --

11:11.371 --> 11:12.937
No, I mean
<i> I</i> had a long day.

11:12.939 --> 11:14.539
I got hurt
on our field trip.

11:14.541 --> 11:16.808
We went to Mount Vernon,
so as you'd expect,

11:16.810 --> 11:19.444
I got my arm busted
by a bunch of Hells Angels.

11:19.446 --> 11:21.346
Sign my cast?
Sure.

11:21.348 --> 11:22.847
No, no.
Not there, not there.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.349
Right there.

11:24.351 --> 11:26.284
Got to leave room
for Zachary and Ella.

11:26.286 --> 11:27.986
I'm gonna have them sign
next to each other,

11:27.988 --> 11:29.521
'cause then
when I break them up,

11:29.523 --> 11:31.356
Ella's gonna cry every time
she sees my cast,

11:31.358 --> 11:33.191
and I'm gonna love it,

11:33.193 --> 11:35.794
'cause she was such a bitch
to me at the lockers last week.

11:35.796 --> 11:39.197
I know
this is all made up.
Some of it.

11:39.199 --> 11:41.232
FRANCINE:
Roger, leave Steve alone.

11:41.234 --> 11:44.903
Thanks, Mom, but I already have
a chocolate milk martini.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.638
This is a<i> real</i> martini.

11:46.640 --> 11:48.506
It's okay.
You're a man now.

11:48.508 --> 11:50.041
A man with mineral rights.

11:50.043 --> 11:51.309
Get drunk!

11:51.311 --> 11:53.078
Then decide
what to do with them.

11:53.080 --> 11:54.546
I can't believe it!

11:54.548 --> 11:56.414
You want me to sell out
to the salt people!

11:56.416 --> 11:59.150
No!
I<i> want</i> you to get drunk.

11:59.152 --> 12:01.519
I<i> believe</i>
that once you get drunk,

12:01.521 --> 12:03.054
you'll sell out
to the salt people.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.323
But what about
our family memories?

12:05.325 --> 12:08.593
We'll buy new memories --
with all that salt money.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.263
(door closes)
And we don't have to share it
with your dad.

12:12.265 --> 12:15.600
In fact, we can give him
this poison martini.

12:15.602 --> 12:17.068
Piss off, Francine.

12:17.070 --> 12:18.670
I've got too much
to live for,

12:18.672 --> 12:21.573
knowing I still have
my Ken Griffey Jr. rookie cards.

12:21.575 --> 12:23.041
ROGER: Um, actually,
you don't.

12:23.043 --> 12:25.076
I put them in the spokes
of my bike last year.

12:25.078 --> 12:26.878
But they were locked away
in my safe.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.913
Stan, honey,
I hate to break this to you,

12:28.915 --> 12:30.381
but I<i> am</i> your safe.

12:30.383 --> 12:31.950
It's one of my personas.
What?!

12:31.952 --> 12:34.018
I'm also
the downstairs toilet.

12:34.020 --> 12:35.353
My cards!

12:35.355 --> 12:36.621
Made me feel boss

12:36.623 --> 12:38.957
when I was riding down
the street, flossin'!

12:38.959 --> 12:40.058
You ruined them.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.193
Those were<i> my</i> cards!
Mine!

12:42.195 --> 12:44.529
I hate this place!

12:44.531 --> 12:46.831
(wheels clicking)

12:50.237 --> 12:53.471
So, we've had some difficulty
getting your son to play ball.

12:53.473 --> 12:55.306
That's because he can't
play ball very well,

12:55.308 --> 12:56.875
so he gets self-conscious
about it.

12:56.877 --> 12:59.043
You just need to start
playing like it's no big deal,

12:59.045 --> 13:00.278
and eventually,
he'll join in.

13:00.280 --> 13:01.780
Charles.
(tires screech)

13:03.216 --> 13:04.816
You're a big meanie.

13:04.818 --> 13:07.418
My God, are you the man
of your house, or aren't you?

13:07.420 --> 13:10.088
Because a man wouldn't let
a boy's contract

13:10.090 --> 13:11.656
stop him
from making this deal.

13:11.658 --> 13:13.124
But it's signed.

13:13.126 --> 13:14.459
And stamped.

13:14.461 --> 13:16.895
You heard the fish.
(sighing) Oh.

13:16.897 --> 13:20.298
I didn't want to come to this.
I really didn't.

13:22.269 --> 13:26.004
(thunder crashes)
What the hell is that?!

13:26.006 --> 13:28.940
This, Mr. Smith, is
the original Gordon Salt Girl,

13:28.942 --> 13:30.475
preserved by salt...

13:30.477 --> 13:33.545
and angered by delays.

13:34.815 --> 13:41.152
(echoing)
Get me that salt!

13:45.258 --> 13:47.225
STEVE:
What are you doing?!

13:48.328 --> 13:51.729
I believe the legal term
is take-backs.

13:55.202 --> 13:58.336
Destroying a young boy's
signed contract --

13:58.338 --> 13:59.971
truly low, sir.

13:59.973 --> 14:02.607
And exactly the kind of thing
I knew you'd do...

14:02.609 --> 14:04.108
which is why...

14:04.110 --> 14:08.613
I moved the real contract
to Snot's for safekeeping.

14:08.615 --> 14:10.148
Well played, son.

14:10.150 --> 14:12.784
You anticipated my move
and had the foresight

14:12.786 --> 14:15.787
to stash the contract
at a secure off-site location.

14:15.789 --> 14:18.523
Which begs the question,
why did you bring it home?

14:18.525 --> 14:20.124
Well, I went to check on it,

14:20.126 --> 14:21.993
and contrary
to what I'd been assured,

14:21.995 --> 14:24.662
Snot did not have
a proper file cabinet.

14:24.664 --> 14:26.297
Where was it?
Like, on his desk or something?

14:26.299 --> 14:28.299
Yeah, with --
Other crap all over the place.

14:28.301 --> 14:30.068
Yes. And it's
not like something

14:30.070 --> 14:31.736
was for sure
going to happen to it.

14:31.738 --> 14:33.404
It's just --
There's a right way
to do things.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.039
Exactly.
Totally get it.

14:36.309 --> 14:38.209
(grunts)

14:38.211 --> 14:39.744
Hey, Steve, did you know

14:39.746 --> 14:42.046
there's a Lego piece
behind your dresser?

14:42.048 --> 14:43.882
Looks like the door
to a smuggler's hatch.

14:43.884 --> 14:45.550
All right, Dad!

14:45.552 --> 14:48.987
As soon as this salt war is
over, I'll thank you properly!

14:52.525 --> 14:54.959
(screaming)

14:57.697 --> 14:59.597
Dad's trying
to destroy the contract

14:59.599 --> 15:01.199
so he can sell out
to Gordon.

15:01.201 --> 15:03.034
Uh-huh.
You got to help me.

15:03.036 --> 15:04.936
Do I?
Of course you do.

15:04.938 --> 15:06.871
You don't want
a salt mine in our yard.

15:06.873 --> 15:09.407
What about our memories
and the environment?

15:09.409 --> 15:11.910
Hmm.
I do love those things.

15:11.912 --> 15:15.213
I also love the idea that if
there's a salt mine in the yard,

15:15.215 --> 15:18.549
I can protest it
without getting out of bed.
Hayley, no!

15:18.551 --> 15:21.286
Basically, this is
the lazy protester's dream.

15:21.288 --> 15:24.455
So, why don't you just
give me the contract?

15:24.457 --> 15:25.924
(groans)

15:25.926 --> 15:27.692
(grunting)

15:30.130 --> 15:32.463
Ugh. Are you gonna make me
get out of bed?

15:38.238 --> 15:40.271
(sighs)

15:44.277 --> 15:45.610
Aah!

15:45.612 --> 15:47.946
Mama? Wh--
What's with the nails?

15:47.948 --> 15:49.280
They're white...

15:49.282 --> 15:50.882
like salt, Steve.

15:50.884 --> 15:53.885
I came up with it
when I realized salt

15:53.887 --> 15:56.788
is the only white thing
in the world!

15:56.790 --> 15:58.990
Mom, that's not even
close to true.

15:58.992 --> 16:01.492
Let's you and me
make it true!

16:01.494 --> 16:04.095
STAN:
Nowhere to run, son.

16:04.097 --> 16:05.563
Or walk.

16:05.565 --> 16:08.399
I think we can all do this
with just walking.

16:11.237 --> 16:12.837
Come on, Steve.
Let's go, Steve.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.105
Give it up, Steve.

16:14.107 --> 16:16.140
What am I doing?

16:16.142 --> 16:18.476
Why am I fighting
for our family memories

16:18.478 --> 16:20.445
if my family
won't fight with me?

16:20.447 --> 16:22.947
I'm with you, Steve!

16:22.949 --> 16:24.983
I'm totally alone
in this.

16:27.854 --> 16:30.288
You know what?
You guys win.

16:30.290 --> 16:34.125
If our memories are meaningless,
then so is this piece of paper.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.727
I renounce it.

16:39.366 --> 16:42.000
"Down the slide
and in the ground,

16:42.002 --> 16:44.836
your special treasure
you'll have found."

16:44.838 --> 16:46.704
I remember that slide.

16:46.706 --> 16:48.439
When I climbed
to the top of it,

16:48.441 --> 16:50.708
it felt like
I was climbing into the sky.

16:50.710 --> 16:53.177
You had a big scary slide
like this, too?

16:53.179 --> 16:56.047
Not<i> your</i> slide, Steve.
<i> My</i> slide.

16:56.049 --> 16:59.183
My dad wrote these clues for me
when I was a kid.

16:59.185 --> 17:01.886
He'd hide them all over
the yard, and I'd look for them.

17:01.888 --> 17:04.822
And when I was done, I'd wake
him up, if I could find him.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.392
Wait, you just recycled
your dad's game?

17:07.394 --> 17:09.727
I haven't thought about that
in years.

17:09.729 --> 17:12.296
What a great memory.
Not for me.

17:12.298 --> 17:14.866
It means all my treasure hunts
were just hand-me-downs.

17:14.868 --> 17:16.467
From my awesome father.

17:16.469 --> 17:18.403
What?!
He abandoned you!

17:18.405 --> 17:19.804
That man's a sociopath!

17:19.806 --> 17:21.806
Quiet, Steve.
I'm getting an idea.

17:21.808 --> 17:23.174
Is it that family memories

17:23.176 --> 17:24.675
are precious
and should be protected?

17:24.677 --> 17:25.910
Uh, duh!

17:25.912 --> 17:27.545
But, also --
try to follow me --

17:27.547 --> 17:30.748
maybe we shouldn't let
the Gordon people mine our yard.

17:30.750 --> 17:32.483
I've been saying that
for a week!

17:32.485 --> 17:34.886
Hope on the bandwagon, Steve.
There's plenty of room.

17:34.888 --> 17:36.354
Now, I'm gonna call them
and --

17:36.356 --> 17:37.655
(rumbling)

17:40.260 --> 17:42.693
Wait!
We've changed our minds!

17:42.695 --> 17:44.362
This isn't
just a patch of dirt.

17:44.364 --> 17:46.264
It's a canvas
on which we've painted

17:46.266 --> 17:48.599
some of the most wonderful
moments of our lives.

17:48.601 --> 17:50.334
That's beautiful,
Mr. Smith.

17:50.336 --> 17:53.071
I believe that I could never buy
the mineral rights

17:53.073 --> 17:54.872
from you or your son.

17:54.874 --> 17:55.873
Great.

17:55.875 --> 17:57.008
So...

17:57.010 --> 17:58.443
about my fence?

17:58.445 --> 18:01.712
Which is why I bought them
from their actual owner.

18:01.714 --> 18:04.182
ANNOUNCER:<i> Actual owner?!</i>
<i> Whoa!</i>

18:04.184 --> 18:06.884
<i> Who will it be,</i>
<i> "American Dad!" fans?</i>

18:06.886 --> 18:09.020
<i> Steve's teacher?</i>
<i> Ken Griffey Jr.?</i>

18:09.022 --> 18:10.621
<i> The Gordon exec</i>
<i> who hasn't spoken yet?</i>

18:10.623 --> 18:12.223
<i> Is it Snot, Barry, or Toshi,</i>

18:12.225 --> 18:14.125
<i> who've all been</i>
<i> conspicuously absent?</i>

18:14.127 --> 18:15.560
<i> Is it me, the announcer?!</i>

18:15.562 --> 18:17.395
<i> Oh, I look like Dracula,</i>
<i> by the way.</i>

18:17.397 --> 18:18.896
<i> Is it Principal Lewis?</i>

18:18.898 --> 18:20.932
<i> Is it Francine's sexy sister,</i>
<i> Gwen?</i>

18:20.934 --> 18:23.901
<i> Is it Diane from an upcoming</i>
<i> episode about slot cars?</i>

18:23.903 --> 18:26.637
<i> Suckboy Tony? James Garfield?</i>
<i> Robert Wuhl?</i>

18:26.639 --> 18:29.474
<i>Tuttle, Buckle, Jackson, Duper,</i>
<i> Hooper, Dick, or Bullock?</i>

18:29.476 --> 18:32.276
<i> Styles, Billy, Jack, Meredith,</i>
<i> Tom from the grocery store?</i>

18:32.278 --> 18:35.446
<i> That sweet little boy from</i>
<i> "The Cleveland Show," Rallo?</i>

18:35.448 --> 18:36.614
It's me!

18:36.616 --> 18:38.382
You're probably realizing now,
Stan,

18:38.384 --> 18:41.385
that permission slip you signed
was a mineral-rights lease.

18:41.387 --> 18:43.754
But when it turned out
Steve was the real owner,

18:43.756 --> 18:47.091
I broke my arm and plastered
another lease around my cast.

18:47.093 --> 18:49.961
Sorry, kid, but you
were throwing away
one hell of a score.

18:49.963 --> 18:51.696
All right, people!
Let's dig!

18:56.336 --> 18:58.970
What? What?!
There's no vein?!

18:58.972 --> 19:02.173
We paid all that money
for just one scoop?!

19:02.175 --> 19:03.474
Sir, there's been a report

19:03.476 --> 19:05.143
of a gusher
in Madison, Wisconsin.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.410
Great.
That's where I'm from.

19:06.412 --> 19:07.645
We can stay with my mom.

19:07.647 --> 19:10.047
She's got
a bumper pool table.

19:11.818 --> 19:14.018
(beeping)

19:14.020 --> 19:18.789
And that, my friends,
is what we call the long con.

19:18.791 --> 19:20.091
What are you
talking about?

19:20.093 --> 19:21.792
I planted that salt.

19:21.794 --> 19:23.995
I set up this whole thing.

19:23.997 --> 19:25.596
It was a sting, baby.

19:25.598 --> 19:28.499
Oh, I've wanted to screw
Gordon Salt for years.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.934
What on earth for?

19:29.936 --> 19:32.003
Well, you know how
my Rabbi Itzhak character

19:32.005 --> 19:33.638
likes to keep kosher?

19:33.640 --> 19:37.475
A few years ago, the rebbe
conducted a surprise inspection

19:37.477 --> 19:39.544
of a Gordon facility
in Arizona

19:39.546 --> 19:43.548
to confirm that their so-called
kosher salt was, indeed, kosher.

19:43.550 --> 19:46.717
I'm not embarrassed to say
I wept and cried for mercy

19:46.719 --> 19:49.353
as I was soundly beaten by
the girl behind the front desk.

19:49.355 --> 19:51.055
But I vowed revenge.

19:51.057 --> 19:54.392
So I bought a 40-pound bag of
salt and buried it in the yard,

19:54.394 --> 19:56.727
bought the power washer
and slapped a Hemi on it,

19:56.729 --> 19:59.530
and I waited for 3 1/2 years

19:59.532 --> 20:01.699
for Stan
to finally clean the patio.

20:01.701 --> 20:03.501
The rest was a breeze.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.736
Why didn't you just
let us in on the con?

20:05.738 --> 20:07.705
I mean, you saw
how it was tearing us apart.

20:07.707 --> 20:10.174
I couldn't trust you to be cool
when the stakes were so high.

20:10.176 --> 20:11.642
How much
did you make?

20:11.644 --> 20:14.412
Let's see. After my salt
purchase, backhoe rental,

20:14.414 --> 20:16.214
power washer,
reconditioned V-8 engine,

20:16.216 --> 20:17.982
hospital bills,
notary for the mineral lease,

20:17.984 --> 20:21.752
plus the staff retreat in
Park City, I cleared 40 bucks.

20:21.754 --> 20:23.187
That's nothing.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.923
No. That's enough
for a bag of charcoal.

20:25.925 --> 20:27.358
¶ A lovely day ¶

20:27.360 --> 20:29.360
¶ Lovely day, lovely day ¶

20:29.362 --> 20:31.195
¶ Lovely day, lovely day ¶

20:31.197 --> 20:32.930
¶ Lovely day ¶

20:32.932 --> 20:36.434
I am going to remember this day
for a long time, honey.

20:36.436 --> 20:38.336
Me too.
It's perfect.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.438
Almost.
It could use a little more...

20:40.440 --> 20:41.706
salt.

20:41.708 --> 20:44.942
(laughter)

20:44.944 --> 20:46.244
That's pretty good,
Roger.

20:46.246 --> 20:48.646
Why don't you toss me
those tongs?

20:55.088 --> 20:56.587
It's pepper.

20:58.358 --> 21:00.558
Nope, it's sewage.

21:00.560 --> 21:02.193
It's Steve's.

21:02.195 --> 21:03.995
Bye!
Have a great time!
