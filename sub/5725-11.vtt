WEBVTT

00:03.371 --> 00:05.806
Argus Air 272,
deviation has not been approved.

00:05.839 --> 00:07.608
Please return
to previously cleared route.

00:07.641 --> 00:09.643
Do you read me?
Are you still there?

00:09.677 --> 00:13.247
(static crackling)

00:13.281 --> 00:15.483
Argus Air 272,
weather at current heading.

00:15.516 --> 00:16.817
Return to cleared route.
Do you copy?

00:16.850 --> 00:19.287
(rumbling)

00:19.320 --> 00:21.055
Washington Center,
Argus 272.

00:21.089 --> 00:23.324
We're experiencing
some turbulence.

00:23.357 --> 00:24.625
Please advise. Over.

00:24.658 --> 00:26.060
All we're getting
is static.

00:26.094 --> 00:27.828
What, is it naptime down there?

00:27.861 --> 00:28.796
(bell chiming)

00:33.367 --> 00:35.769
Argus 272, if you read
transmission, ident. Ident.

00:37.705 --> 00:39.840
(staticky communication)

00:39.873 --> 00:41.742
(alarms beeping)
Whoa.
Whoa. Whoa, whoa.

00:41.775 --> 00:44.412
Wh-What is this?

00:44.445 --> 00:45.679
I'll cross-check
the instruments.

00:45.713 --> 00:46.680
See what that was all about.

00:46.714 --> 00:48.416
Washington Center, Argus 272.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.050
(staticky):
...read... how do you read?

00:52.720 --> 00:55.055
Argus 272,
weather at current heading.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.092
(alarm blaring)

01:00.261 --> 01:01.829
I need a supervisor.

01:01.862 --> 01:03.597
Looks like we've got
an ADS-B malfunction.

01:03.631 --> 01:05.333
I've got phantom planes here.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.834
They're all
Argus 272.

01:06.867 --> 01:09.570
Argus Air 272, ident.
Ident immediately.

01:09.603 --> 01:11.472
Get the Domestic Events Network
on the phone, ASAP.

01:11.505 --> 01:13.441
We've got
an emergency situation.

01:13.474 --> 01:14.808
This is your captain speaking.

01:14.842 --> 01:16.410
We are approaching
a band of severe weather.

01:16.444 --> 01:17.745
Fasten your seatbelts

01:17.778 --> 01:19.313
and remain seated.
Thank you.

01:19.347 --> 01:21.615
Transmission ident.
Do you read me?

01:21.649 --> 01:23.784
Sir, I have them
on the line.
Argus Air 272, do you read me?

01:23.817 --> 01:26.420
If you read transmission, id...

01:27.688 --> 01:28.722
Sir?

01:28.756 --> 01:30.758
Sir, the planes just
disappeared. All the planes.

01:30.791 --> 01:33.127
Argus Air Flight 272
is no longer on my scope.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.598
SUPERVISOR:
What?

01:37.631 --> 01:39.767
Flight 272 is gone.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.504
Flight 272 took off

01:43.537 --> 01:46.874
this afternoon from Tampa,
heading for Rhode Island.

01:46.907 --> 01:48.776
We lost contact over
Wilmington, North Carolina,

01:48.809 --> 01:49.810
an hour and a half ago.

01:49.843 --> 01:50.878
Plane just disappeared.

01:50.911 --> 01:53.647
Plane relay any indication
of mechanical failure?

01:53.681 --> 01:55.483
Technical malfunction?
Not that I know of.

01:55.516 --> 01:56.817
The flight was just off course.

01:56.850 --> 01:57.918
I tried to contact the pilot,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.920
and suddenly, phantom planes
appeared on the scope.

01:59.953 --> 02:01.455
SUPERVISOR:
Our I.T. department

02:01.489 --> 02:02.590
couldn't explain
the phantom planes,

02:02.623 --> 02:04.425
but they did uncover
a cyber intrusion,

02:04.458 --> 02:05.626
which we told you about.

02:05.659 --> 02:07.595
Someone assigned Flight 272

02:07.628 --> 02:08.862
an unauthenticated flight plan

02:08.896 --> 02:10.931
right before takeoff.
Pilot couldn't have known.

02:10.964 --> 02:13.667
That's why the plane veered off
course before it disappeared.

02:13.701 --> 02:14.902
That plane wasn't
supposed to be

02:14.935 --> 02:15.736
anywhere near that storm.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.871
Any other planes
reporting problems?

02:17.905 --> 02:18.872
No, but we're double checking.

02:18.906 --> 02:20.841
If the hacker already intruded
into the system,

02:20.874 --> 02:23.844
it's possible he has
a backdoor into the NAS,

02:23.877 --> 02:25.413
and every flight

02:25.446 --> 02:27.381
in the sky is vulnerable.

02:29.450 --> 02:30.484
NELSON:
Come on, Krummy.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.719
Why walk when you can glide?

02:31.752 --> 02:32.853
I mean, look at this.

02:32.886 --> 02:33.921
Huh?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.860
Ooh.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.229
With that Agent Pierce?

02:41.262 --> 02:43.764
Rosalyn is in town
for a conference

02:43.797 --> 02:45.266
and I'm her only friend in DC.

02:45.299 --> 02:46.267
Look at Krummy.

02:46.300 --> 02:47.301
Making moves.

02:47.335 --> 02:48.636
Yeah.
Huh?

02:48.669 --> 02:49.937
(chuckles)

02:49.970 --> 02:51.439
NELSON:
Oh, snap.

02:51.472 --> 02:52.973
That's Emmitt Smith.

02:53.006 --> 02:54.908
That's Emmitt Sm...

02:54.942 --> 02:57.611
Yo, DB is going
to be so jealous

02:57.645 --> 02:58.846
he was out of
town for this.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.414
Hey, Emmitt!

03:00.448 --> 03:02.850
Hey, Emmitt!
Emmitt!

03:02.883 --> 03:03.851
Oh, Emmitt!

03:03.884 --> 03:05.253
Hey, man!

03:05.286 --> 03:06.487
What's up? What's up?
Brody Nelson.

03:06.520 --> 03:07.821
Brody?
How you doing?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:07.855 --> 03:08.822
Daniel
Krumitz.
Daniel.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.923
Diehard
Redskins fan,

03:09.957 --> 03:11.325
but I can still
appreciate

03:11.359 --> 03:12.560
the NFL's all-time
leading rusher.

03:12.593 --> 03:13.994
Thank you, man.

03:14.027 --> 03:15.263
Man, I like
those wheels.

03:15.296 --> 03:16.264
Oh, thanks, man.

03:16.297 --> 03:17.365
Self-balancing electric scooter.

03:17.398 --> 03:18.999
How fast can that thing go?

03:19.032 --> 03:20.868
Only one way
to find out.

03:20.901 --> 03:22.403
Think you still got
that first step?

03:22.436 --> 03:23.504
You know it.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.573
But, uh... I am in
my dress shoes.

03:25.606 --> 03:26.774
Mmm, okay.

03:26.807 --> 03:28.242
Go!

03:28.276 --> 03:29.510
(whoops)
To the 40!

03:29.543 --> 03:30.911
To the 30!

03:30.944 --> 03:33.247
(whoops)
EMMITT:
That's your friend, huh?

03:33.281 --> 03:34.948
We work together.

03:34.982 --> 03:36.784
But if you didn't
have dress shoes on,

03:36.817 --> 03:37.918
would you have
raced him?

03:37.951 --> 03:39.753
You know, when you
have the skills,

03:39.787 --> 03:40.854
you got to put 'em to use.

03:40.888 --> 03:42.022
Hmm.

03:42.055 --> 03:43.691
What about you and me?

03:43.724 --> 03:44.892
What about it?

03:44.925 --> 03:45.926
In socks.

03:46.994 --> 03:48.362
Bad idea. Sorry.
(phone chiming)

03:48.396 --> 03:49.730
Come on, man.

03:49.763 --> 03:50.964
Nelson!

03:50.998 --> 03:51.965
We gotta go!

03:51.999 --> 03:53.033
Uh...

03:53.066 --> 03:54.902
Okay.
Bye, Emmitt Smith!

03:54.935 --> 03:57.571
MAN: Hey, can I have
your autograph?
WOMAN: Look, it's Emmitt Smith!

03:57.605 --> 03:58.939
REPORTER:
An Argus Airline flight

03:58.972 --> 04:01.975
has been reported missing
with 75 people on board.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.845
A spokesman for the airline
has confirmed

04:04.878 --> 04:06.314
that search and rescue teams...

04:06.347 --> 04:07.615
REPORTER 2: ...friends and
family have gathered

04:07.648 --> 04:09.517
outside the airport
and are demanding answers.

04:10.951 --> 04:12.453
REPORTER 2: We're going live
now to T.F. Green Airport.

04:12.486 --> 04:14.688
The flight was traveling
from Tampa, Florida,

04:14.722 --> 04:16.924
to Providence, Rhode Island,
when it went missing.

04:16.957 --> 04:19.527
Attempts to contact the plane
have not been successful.

04:19.560 --> 04:22.663
We are coordinating with
the FAA, Department of Defense,

04:22.696 --> 04:24.031
Homeland Security and NORAD.

04:24.064 --> 04:25.966
Director!
Director!
Director!

04:25.999 --> 04:27.501
What about reports

04:27.535 --> 04:29.470
of a potential crash site
in North Carolina?

04:29.503 --> 04:30.971
Any rumors of a crash are false.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.641
Deputy Director Ryan
of the Cyber Division

04:33.674 --> 04:36.043
is prepared to fill you in
with what we do know.

04:40.881 --> 04:43.384
Our investigation has uncovered

04:43.417 --> 04:46.387
a cyber intrusion in the NAS
flight plan database.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.588
We're currently assessing

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
if any other aircraft
has been affected.

04:49.690 --> 04:51.359
At this point,
no one has come forward

04:51.392 --> 04:52.860
to take credit for the hack.

04:52.893 --> 04:55.996
But we do know
that the missing plane

04:56.029 --> 04:58.432
was intentionally diverted
from its path.

04:58.466 --> 05:02.936
But as of now, we simply have
no idea where Flight 272 is.

05:02.970 --> 05:05.005
(reporters clamoring)
Well, you need to find out.

05:05.038 --> 05:06.774
Our children are on that plane.

05:06.807 --> 05:08.976
My daughter Emily
and her teammates.

05:09.009 --> 05:11.345
What are you going
to do to find them?

05:13.681 --> 05:15.916
I know that this is hard.

05:15.949 --> 05:17.751
I know you need answers

05:17.785 --> 05:18.952
and I wish I had them.

05:18.986 --> 05:22.523
But our investigation is still
in its preliminary stages.

05:24.925 --> 05:25.993
But you need to know

05:26.026 --> 05:27.928
that it is everyone's
top priority

05:27.961 --> 05:30.931
to find Flight 272.

05:30.964 --> 05:32.733
Radar is searching.

05:32.766 --> 05:33.867
Jets have been scrambled.

05:33.901 --> 05:38.105
And I will do everything
in my power to find that plane.

05:38.138 --> 05:41.341
And to find your children.

05:43.877 --> 05:45.946
Question.
Question.
Director...

05:45.979 --> 05:47.548
Question!
Director...
Question.

05:47.581 --> 05:50.984
CONTROLLER: Monument Air 625,
Washington Center...

05:51.018 --> 05:52.686
(sighs)

05:52.720 --> 05:54.988
Krummy, this is
crazy, man.

05:55.022 --> 05:56.957
It's like Malaysia Air
all over again.

05:56.990 --> 05:59.092
I'm not finding anything that
explains those phantom planes.

05:59.126 --> 06:00.628
Equipment
all checks out.

06:00.661 --> 06:02.029
Yeah. Here, too.

06:02.062 --> 06:04.465
Look, I don't think
the scope is to blame.

06:04.498 --> 06:06.133
I mean, the FAA would have
figured that out themselves.

06:06.166 --> 06:08.869
I mean, the fact that
they needed to call us at all

06:08.902 --> 06:10.471
means that the intrusion's
much more sophisticated.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.973
I'm thinking that Flight 272's
onboard GPS device

06:13.006 --> 06:15.008
may have been tampered with.
Okay, wait a minute.

06:15.042 --> 06:18.579
One device can cause 50 separate
phantom planes to appear?

06:18.612 --> 06:20.147
Well, technically, if it can
create one, it can create 50,

06:20.180 --> 06:22.750
and we both know that there's
not 50 Flight 272s

06:22.783 --> 06:24.051
flying around up there.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.620
The plane was flying
directly into bad weather.

06:26.654 --> 06:29.089
Could a lightning strike
cause this kind of glitch?

06:29.122 --> 06:30.691
No, I already ruled that out.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.925
It had to be deliberate.

06:31.959 --> 06:34.061
The plane's GPS device
should be telling us

06:34.094 --> 06:36.196
exactly where
the plane actually was.

06:36.229 --> 06:37.765
Yeah. Instead, it created
50 phantom planes

06:37.798 --> 06:39.633
spread across a ten-mile radius.

06:39.667 --> 06:41.068
And every one
of the phantom planes

06:41.101 --> 06:43.771
is being broadcast
by a single GPS device.

06:43.804 --> 06:45.205
Okay.

06:45.238 --> 06:47.107
I'm gonna triangulate
the last known location

06:47.140 --> 06:49.843
of the GPS device and I should
get the last known location

06:49.877 --> 06:51.078
of the real Flight 272.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.182
Looks like it crashed
right there.

06:55.215 --> 06:56.617
Wilmington, North Carolina.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.651
That elevation's low.

06:57.685 --> 06:58.686
Too low.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.558
(sirens wailing, horn blaring)

07:11.965 --> 07:14.201
Director, I'm approaching
the crash site now.

07:25.946 --> 07:28.549
There's nothing here.

07:32.119 --> 07:34.121
ELIJAH:
Krumitz, I thought there was
supposed to be a plane crash.

07:34.154 --> 07:35.322
What, exactly,
are we looking for?

07:35.355 --> 07:37.157
KRUMITZ: I'm sort of hoping
I'll know it when I see it.

07:37.190 --> 07:38.926
I thought the aircraft's
GPS device

07:38.959 --> 07:40.861
was broadcasting
those phantom planes,

07:40.894 --> 07:41.962
but clearly,
I was wrong about that.

07:41.995 --> 07:43.030
What else could do that?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.598
Whatever it is,
it's in this field

07:44.632 --> 07:45.799
and we just need to find it.

07:53.807 --> 07:55.275
ELIJAH:
Tire tracks.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.511
Somebody drove
through here recently.

07:57.545 --> 07:59.547
Last couple of days,
I'd say.

08:04.685 --> 08:06.119
Something was unloaded here,
and all that's left

08:06.153 --> 08:08.121
are a bunch of cords
and empty cases.

08:11.158 --> 08:13.026
(rustling, clinking)

08:22.169 --> 08:24.204
I think we just found
our plane crash.

08:24.237 --> 08:26.273
*

08:47.895 --> 08:50.898
Local units are running down
the tire tracks

08:50.931 --> 08:53.734
we came across in North
Carolina, but it's a long shot.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.168
How are you guys
coming along?
This is what you and I

08:55.202 --> 08:56.169
pulled out of that tree.

08:56.203 --> 08:57.270
It's an inflatable antenna.

08:57.304 --> 08:58.471
Like a GATR.

08:58.505 --> 09:01.942
Military uses them during
ground combat for communication.

09:01.975 --> 09:03.844
It's lightweight,
portable, powerful.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.012
What was this one
being used for?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.346
Software-defined radio.

09:06.379 --> 09:07.447
He's a clever bastard.

09:07.480 --> 09:10.317
Taking advantage of
Air Traffic Control's reliance

09:10.350 --> 09:12.019
on GPS to monitor planes.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.020
ADS-B.

09:13.053 --> 09:14.021
It's the latest and greatest

09:14.054 --> 09:14.955
in air traffic surveillance.

09:14.988 --> 09:16.323
Just like in your car
or on your phone.

09:16.356 --> 09:17.758
Tells the pilot
where he's going.

09:17.791 --> 09:18.992
Tells Air Traffic Control

09:19.026 --> 09:20.327
exactly where
the plane is located.

09:20.360 --> 09:21.695
Yeah, but the
system was built

09:21.729 --> 09:22.996
for convenience, not security.

09:23.030 --> 09:25.132
An SD radio,
like this one here,

09:25.165 --> 09:26.834
can spoof GPS signals.

09:26.867 --> 09:28.135
NELSON: It could tell
Air Traffic Control

09:28.168 --> 09:29.302
that there's planes
in the sky

09:29.336 --> 09:30.370
even when there are none.

09:30.403 --> 09:32.239
And Air Traffic Control

09:32.272 --> 09:33.206
can't tell the difference

09:33.240 --> 09:34.241
between the real planes
and these fake ones.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.209
NELSON: Dot on the screen
is a dot on the screen.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.210
It's all the same to them.

09:37.244 --> 09:39.046
It's a huge vulnerability

09:39.079 --> 09:40.213
and someone just exploited it.

09:40.247 --> 09:41.281
ELIJAH:
So first, our hacker

09:41.314 --> 09:44.985
assigned Flight 272
an unauthorized flight plan.

09:45.018 --> 09:47.788
The pilot, unaware of the hack,
did what he was supposed to do,

09:47.821 --> 09:50.157
and diverted the plane,
per those instructions.

09:52.059 --> 09:53.326
Next, they spoofed
a bunch of signals

09:53.360 --> 09:55.863
so Air Traffic Control couldn't
keep track of the real plane,

09:55.896 --> 09:57.197
and in the chaos,

09:57.230 --> 09:59.366
Flight 272
slipped away.

09:59.399 --> 10:01.869
We're not just looking
for a missing plane.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.004
This is a cyber hijacking.

10:07.407 --> 10:13.346
* I know you've deceived me,
now here's a surprise *

10:15.448 --> 10:21.822
* I know that you have, 'cause
there's magic in my eyes *

10:21.855 --> 10:25.158
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:25.192 --> 10:29.196
* I can see for miles
and miles *

10:29.229 --> 10:33.266
* I can see
for miles and miles *

10:33.300 --> 10:37.037
* And miles...

10:37.070 --> 10:38.071
* Oh, yeah.

10:51.418 --> 10:54.154
Flight 272 has been missing
for a little over three hours.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.389
This is the distance
a plane could've traveled

10:56.423 --> 10:57.624
during that time.

10:57.657 --> 10:59.426
KRUMITZ: Current search area
is half a million square miles.

10:59.459 --> 11:01.128
Plane disappeared
into bad weather.

11:01.161 --> 11:04.331
There's no way of telling
what direction it's heading now.

11:04.364 --> 11:06.399
The SD radio created
50 fake planes

11:06.433 --> 11:09.402
in order to mask which direction
the real Flight 272

11:09.436 --> 11:11.705
was heading when it vanished.

11:11.739 --> 11:13.907
It's like a "Zerg Rush"--
it's a gaming strategy,

11:13.941 --> 11:15.909
where you implement a swarm to
overtake a stronger opponent.

11:15.943 --> 11:18.345
But in this case,
our cyber hijacker

11:18.378 --> 11:21.882
used spoofed signals
to confuse air traffic control.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.416
And because of the chaos,
there's no way of knowing

11:23.450 --> 11:25.085
what the plane's
final heading was.

11:25.118 --> 11:27.254
Jets were scrambled,
but with visibility so low,

11:27.287 --> 11:28.188
the plane was
long gone.

11:28.221 --> 11:29.422
Good news--
no plane crashes

11:29.456 --> 11:30.457
or signs of debris
have been reported.

11:30.490 --> 11:31.725
So as far as we know,

11:31.759 --> 11:33.326
Flight 272 is still airborne.

11:33.360 --> 11:35.896
Bad news-- they now have less
than two hours of fuel left.

11:35.929 --> 11:38.031
And the pilot has no idea that
the flight plan's been altered,

11:38.065 --> 11:41.902
so he'll be running out of fuel
with no plan on where to land.

11:41.935 --> 11:43.737
MUNDO: Coast Guard search
and rescue is out there.

11:43.771 --> 11:45.472
Every plane in the sky
is on the lookout,

11:45.505 --> 11:47.274
but time is not on our side.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.476
How can a commercial airplane
just vanish?

11:49.509 --> 11:51.879
Ground-based radar can detect
a plane flying over land

11:51.912 --> 11:53.480
or up to 200 miles
off the coast,

11:53.513 --> 11:54.481
and they've come up empty,

11:54.514 --> 11:56.383
so we're guessing that
this flight is out to sea.

11:56.416 --> 11:58.886
KRUMITZ: The real
weird thing is

11:58.919 --> 12:01.088
the plane's GPS signal should
still work and it's not.

12:01.121 --> 12:02.956
Along with half a dozen
other communication devices

12:02.990 --> 12:04.291
used to talk to the
ground, I mean,

12:04.324 --> 12:06.093
the plane went silent.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.261
Could the pilot have
turned that off?

12:08.295 --> 12:09.863
GPS locators all come on
when the plane does.

12:09.897 --> 12:11.398
Pilot can't just
disconnect them.

12:11.431 --> 12:12.966
Our missing plane
went completely dark.

12:13.000 --> 12:14.467
It just, it makes no sense.

12:14.501 --> 12:17.037
Is there some kind
of object or-or device

12:17.070 --> 12:18.338
that could interfere
with all those signals?

12:18.371 --> 12:19.506
Possibly, yeah.

12:19.539 --> 12:21.241
Something could be
running interference,

12:21.274 --> 12:22.309
like a, like a
signal disrupter.

12:22.342 --> 12:24.077
It would have to be
physically brought on board

12:24.111 --> 12:26.346
by somebody who's
on that plane now.

12:26.379 --> 12:27.948
MUNDO:
71 passengers

12:27.981 --> 12:29.382
and four crew members.

12:29.416 --> 12:32.452
That means we have 75 suspects.

12:33.821 --> 12:35.789
We have a possible hijacker
on that flight.

12:35.823 --> 12:37.157
We need to single them out.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.525
Pull up the flight manifest.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.393
We're looking for outliers;
anyone who stands out.

12:40.427 --> 12:41.995
All right, how about
the guy in 2F?

12:42.029 --> 12:43.363
Edger Miller--
bought his ticket

12:43.396 --> 12:44.497
at the airport today.

12:44.531 --> 12:47.334
What do we know about
Edger Miller on social media?

12:47.367 --> 12:48.969
"Edger Miller-- single."

12:49.002 --> 12:51.371
Occupation listed--
mechanical engineer.

12:51.404 --> 12:52.572
And he's worked
at the telephone company

12:52.605 --> 12:54.975
for two years.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.443
Well, an engineer might know

12:56.476 --> 12:58.211
a little something
about hijacking a plane.

12:58.245 --> 12:59.813
Think that it might be
a domestic terrorist?

12:59.847 --> 13:00.881
I'm not ruling anything out.

13:00.914 --> 13:02.850
Okay, check out 12C.

13:02.883 --> 13:04.551
Paul Lammers.
He's on a one-way ticket.

13:04.584 --> 13:06.319
No return booked.

13:06.353 --> 13:07.187
RAMIREZ:
Paul's ex-military.

13:07.220 --> 13:08.822
Started working
in the private sector

13:08.856 --> 13:10.824
two years ago.

13:10.858 --> 13:13.093
Married, three children.

13:13.126 --> 13:15.128
Okay, recent post
says that he was heading

13:15.162 --> 13:17.464
to Providence to bid
on a new construction job.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.266
Well, that explains
the open-ended travel.

13:19.299 --> 13:20.567
He's not sure how long
he'll be there.

13:20.600 --> 13:22.602
How about Erica Chan, seat 10D?

13:22.635 --> 13:24.437
Flying on a Chinese passport.

13:24.471 --> 13:26.006
Immigration
has her visiting

13:26.039 --> 13:28.341
the United States
on a student visa.

13:28.375 --> 13:30.343
(thunder crashing)

13:30.377 --> 13:32.612
RAMIREZ: No American social
media presence that I can find.

13:32.645 --> 13:34.347
I'll have Interpol check Renren,

13:34.381 --> 13:35.849
see if she posted
anything at home.

13:35.883 --> 13:37.484
Rows four and five.

13:37.517 --> 13:39.920
Those are the high schoolers
returning home.

13:39.953 --> 13:41.421
Volleyball team.

13:41.454 --> 13:43.056
Our children are on that plane.

13:43.090 --> 13:45.158
My daughter Emily
and her teammates.

13:45.192 --> 13:48.161
There's eight students
and two chaperones.

13:48.195 --> 13:49.596
RAMIREZ: They can't
possibly be involved.

13:49.629 --> 13:51.598
RYAN: Right now,
everyone's a suspect.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.937
What do we know about our pilot?

13:56.970 --> 13:57.804
Veteran pilot.

13:57.837 --> 13:58.638
He's been with Argus
Air for 12 years.

13:58.671 --> 14:01.474
Personnel file is,
well, spotless.

14:01.508 --> 14:03.143
Okay, recent
relationship status--

14:03.176 --> 14:05.212
married to divorced to single.

14:05.245 --> 14:06.880
You think
Richard Reynolds cracked?

14:06.914 --> 14:07.881
Maybe another
German Wings situation?

14:07.915 --> 14:09.549
You know, pilot kills himself

14:09.582 --> 14:11.184
along with everybody
else on board?

14:11.218 --> 14:12.352
RYAN: I don't
know about that.

14:12.385 --> 14:13.887
Look at all this support
he's receiving.

14:13.921 --> 14:14.888
Friends, family--

14:14.922 --> 14:16.589
they're all commenting
with love and support.

14:16.623 --> 14:18.358
And changing
his relationship status

14:18.391 --> 14:20.961
to single means
that he is healing.

14:20.994 --> 14:22.329
Richard's moving on.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.597
And as far as we know,
pilot's following protocol.

14:24.631 --> 14:27.467
Lost radio communication--
he'll stick to his flight plan.

14:27.500 --> 14:29.903
Our cyber hijackers
thought this through.

14:29.937 --> 14:32.205
This is meticulously
planned, well-executed,

14:32.239 --> 14:34.207
but high-risk.

14:34.241 --> 14:36.243
They have to be on board
to make this work.

14:36.276 --> 14:38.946
What would motivate
someone to do that?

14:38.979 --> 14:40.147
No one's taking credit
for the attack.

14:40.180 --> 14:42.615
Yeah, and no one's defecting
from Florida to Rhode Island.

14:42.649 --> 14:45.085
I doubt it's political.

14:45.118 --> 14:47.620
Then what is so important
about Flight 272?

14:47.654 --> 14:50.423
Argus 272 at flight level 350.

14:50.457 --> 14:52.359
How do you read, over?

14:52.392 --> 14:54.394
(static crackling)

14:54.427 --> 14:56.096
There's nothing.

14:56.129 --> 14:58.932
No radio,
even the datalink's a bust.

14:58.966 --> 15:01.601
(thunder rumbling)

15:01.634 --> 15:03.203
The storm's not
letting up, is it?

15:03.236 --> 15:05.138
Well, I've flown
through worse weather.

15:05.172 --> 15:06.706
Just stick to the flight
plan, we should be fine.

15:06.739 --> 15:07.774
We start diverting
on our own,

15:07.807 --> 15:09.943
we're liable to end up in
someone else's airspace,

15:09.977 --> 15:12.612
and that's how midair
collisions happen.

15:12.645 --> 15:15.082
You all right?

15:15.115 --> 15:16.249
Yeah, yeah.

15:16.283 --> 15:19.052
Just... heart's racing.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.963
I feel like my blood sugar's
a little low.

15:29.997 --> 15:31.231
I'm gonna have
a flight attendant

15:31.264 --> 15:32.332
bring me an orange juice.

15:32.365 --> 15:33.533
Well, listen,
without radio contact,

15:33.566 --> 15:35.002
we're virtually
flying blind.

15:35.035 --> 15:36.236
Do whatever you got to do.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.604
I need you at 100%.

15:42.042 --> 15:43.676
ARTIE: This is just
a big misunderstanding!

15:43.710 --> 15:44.877
MAN: Sir, you're gonna
have to calm down!

15:44.911 --> 15:46.579
Talk to Agent Mundo, Agent
Krumitz-- they can vouch for me!

15:46.613 --> 15:48.015
You're gonna have to talk to me.

15:48.048 --> 15:49.349
Oh, you're Deputy Director Ryan.

15:49.382 --> 15:50.517
It's a pleasure
to meet you.

15:50.550 --> 15:52.485
I've heard great things
about you.

15:52.519 --> 15:53.653
All right, on your feet.

15:55.588 --> 15:57.024
I'm-I'm, uh, Artie Sneed.

15:57.057 --> 15:58.591
Artie?

15:58.625 --> 16:00.027
Uh, has anyone mentioned me?

16:00.060 --> 16:01.194
I think I've heard
your name before.

16:01.228 --> 16:03.263
I just didn't know
that you were

16:03.296 --> 16:04.697
visiting us today.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.533
Ma'am, this man was attempting
to enter the building

16:06.566 --> 16:07.667
with doctored documentation.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.602
No, no, no, no, no.
That's my pass

16:09.636 --> 16:11.438
from the last time I was here,
it just had the wrong date.

16:11.471 --> 16:12.772
I changed the date, which
was actually very easy.

16:12.805 --> 16:15.375
Very, very easy.
RYAN: Mr. Sneed!

16:15.408 --> 16:17.210
We're in the midst of a crisis.
I don't have time for this.

16:17.244 --> 16:18.745
If you want to speak
to one of my agents,

16:18.778 --> 16:19.712
I recommend you call first.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.082
No, no, wait, wait! Wait.

16:22.115 --> 16:24.251
The missing plane?
I saw it on the news today.

16:24.284 --> 16:25.485
It just vanished?

16:25.518 --> 16:27.654
I think I can help you
figure out why.

16:29.656 --> 16:31.591
And you stand right here.

16:31.624 --> 16:34.061
Okay?

16:35.728 --> 16:38.598
Everyone is in position,
whenever you're ready.

16:38.631 --> 16:41.734
Okay, turning it on now.

16:41.768 --> 16:44.304
(blipping,
low electronic squealing)

16:46.273 --> 16:47.774
Mark, am I blocking your signal?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.109
No, still green.

16:49.142 --> 16:51.711
Amy?

16:51.744 --> 16:54.714
All this to figure out how
our missing plane went silent?

16:54.747 --> 16:55.548
Oh, hey, Elijah.

16:55.582 --> 16:57.150
I'll tell you,
that boss of yours--

16:57.184 --> 16:58.351
she is a hell of a woman.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.586
She put me
through the wringer

16:59.619 --> 17:00.820
before she'd even
let me come up here.

17:00.853 --> 17:02.622
She's not a huge fan
of uninvited guests.

17:02.655 --> 17:03.790
Oh, she is a force
to be reckoned with.

17:03.823 --> 17:05.058
Artie?

17:05.092 --> 17:05.692
What is all this?

17:05.725 --> 17:07.660
Oh, this is great.

17:07.694 --> 17:09.196
What I have done
is devised a way

17:09.229 --> 17:10.663
to bring the plane to us.

17:10.697 --> 17:12.499
I reconstructed

17:12.532 --> 17:15.202
the entire plane, Flight 272.

17:15.235 --> 17:17.270
If you look over here,

17:17.304 --> 17:18.671
this is the left wing,

17:18.705 --> 17:20.707
which stretches out
across Pennsylvania Avenue.

17:20.740 --> 17:23.710
And right now,
I'm standing on the engine.

17:23.743 --> 17:25.412
You kind of have
to use your imagination.

17:25.445 --> 17:27.080
And you'll notice

17:27.114 --> 17:28.781
that each one of these techs

17:28.815 --> 17:30.517
is holding various
different pieces

17:30.550 --> 17:32.452
of communication equipment
that will be found

17:32.485 --> 17:33.686
on Flight 272.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.222
And I'm holding
a signal jammer.

17:35.255 --> 17:36.356
It can block a wide range

17:36.389 --> 17:37.857
of radio frequencies.

17:37.890 --> 17:38.991
Take that thing
to a movie theater,

17:39.025 --> 17:41.694
and no one around you will be
getting any phone calls.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.696
And that signal jammer explains
why our plane is invisible.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.499
Our hijacker has a device
like this on board.

17:46.533 --> 17:49.469
Well, anyone sitting in the
first 15 rows of the airplane,

17:49.502 --> 17:50.837
with a signal jammer like this,

17:50.870 --> 17:54.741
is gonna block all
the instruments in the cockpit.

17:54.774 --> 17:56.876
Which would render
all the radios useless.

17:56.909 --> 17:59.412
But I'm sensing
there's a bigger issue here.

17:59.446 --> 18:00.680
Guys?

18:00.713 --> 18:02.149
Amy, still nothing?

18:02.182 --> 18:04.151
Mark, am I blocking
your signal?

18:04.184 --> 18:05.285
No?

18:05.318 --> 18:07.854
Engine manufacturers
equip their engines

18:07.887 --> 18:09.756
with self-diagnostic tools that
wirelessly talk to the ground.

18:09.789 --> 18:12.725
Air traffic control should be
getting updates from them.

18:12.759 --> 18:15.562
But that's just
not the case with Flight 272.

18:15.595 --> 18:17.797
ARTIE: You see,
(clears throat) the plane's

18:17.830 --> 18:20.367
fuselage causes
too much attenuation

18:20.400 --> 18:22.569
so that a common, um,
signal jammer

18:22.602 --> 18:23.803
can't block these
kinds of signals.

18:23.836 --> 18:25.505
So that signal jammer's
not strong enough?

18:25.538 --> 18:26.706
Correct, no.

18:26.739 --> 18:28.175
Artie, why do you know
so much about airplanes?

18:28.208 --> 18:29.676
Uh, Baltimore
RC Aeronautics Club.

18:29.709 --> 18:30.643
Charter Member.

18:30.677 --> 18:33.180
We strive for accuracy,
which, believe me,

18:33.213 --> 18:34.747
takes tremendous
amount of research;

18:34.781 --> 18:35.615
planes schematics, etc.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.218
You'd be surprised
what you can find

18:38.251 --> 18:39.919
if you know--
Got it, got it.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.788
Artie, did you bring
anything strong enough

18:41.821 --> 18:43.423
to reach the engines
through the fuselage?

18:45.192 --> 18:47.627
Maybe. Um...

18:47.660 --> 18:49.762
Let's see, uh...

18:49.796 --> 18:51.431
I just got to find--

18:51.464 --> 18:52.899
Aha!

18:52.932 --> 18:54.401
(grunts)

18:54.434 --> 18:57.570
This is what we call
a white noise generator.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.539
Uh, essentially,

18:59.572 --> 19:02.709
it's a-a, a signal jammer
on steroids.

19:07.747 --> 19:09.249
How do we know it's working?

19:09.282 --> 19:10.483
(jammer beeping quietly)

19:10.517 --> 19:11.918
(alarm beeping)
WOMAN: What's going on?

19:11.951 --> 19:12.852
(staffers murmuring)

19:12.885 --> 19:14.721
Oh, it's working.

19:14.754 --> 19:17.624
It's jamming the signal
right here in CTOC.

19:17.657 --> 19:18.525
MAN: What is this?

19:18.558 --> 19:19.792
(murmuring continues)

19:19.826 --> 19:21.228
This is the only thing
strong enough

19:21.261 --> 19:23.630
to make Flight 272
become invisible.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.632
So, how does someone get that

19:25.665 --> 19:27.867
through airport security
and onto our plane?

19:27.900 --> 19:30.303
We're looking
for anyone on our flight

19:30.337 --> 19:31.638
traveling with a large
piece of equipment.

19:31.671 --> 19:32.739
Anything suspicious at all.

19:32.772 --> 19:34.641
Just found the flight crew.
I'm cueing it up now.

19:35.975 --> 19:37.344
RYAN: Right there.

19:37.377 --> 19:38.911
Our copilot set off
the metal detector.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.581
All right, TSA logs report

19:41.614 --> 19:43.716
that our copilot,
Anthony Briggs,

19:43.750 --> 19:44.817
has an implanted
insulin pump.

19:44.851 --> 19:46.319
Now, Argus personnel file

19:46.353 --> 19:47.620
doesn't have any
mention of diabetes.

19:47.654 --> 19:48.755
Yeah, well that's 'cause

19:48.788 --> 19:49.922
commercial airline
pilots aren't

19:49.956 --> 19:51.591
permitted to be
insulin dependent.

19:51.624 --> 19:52.992
My flying buddies
talk about this.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.927
Pilots with conditions
that should ground them,

19:54.961 --> 19:57.397
they just simply don't tell
the FAA about the diagnosis.

19:57.430 --> 19:59.732
It's doctor/patient
confidentiality.

19:59.766 --> 20:01.268
But TSA doesn't know
about those regulations.

20:01.301 --> 20:02.935
So they just check the paperwork
and let 'em through.

20:02.969 --> 20:04.637
But keeping a secret
from your employer

20:04.671 --> 20:06.873
does not make you a hijacker.

20:06.906 --> 20:07.940
Yeah, well, he
travels light.

20:07.974 --> 20:10.243
He didn't bring that white
noise generator on board.

20:10.277 --> 20:12.579
RAMIREZ: Hey,
I got Edger Miller.

20:12.612 --> 20:14.414
RYAN: The guy who bought
the same-day ticket.

20:14.447 --> 20:15.815
Yeah, I did some more digging
on his travel plans.

20:15.848 --> 20:17.884
Turns out that he's
flying home to Providence

20:17.917 --> 20:18.918
to surprise his mother
for her birthday.

20:18.951 --> 20:20.420
MUNDO:
He's clean.

20:20.453 --> 20:21.754
Guys, I think I got
something here.

20:21.788 --> 20:23.256
Erica Chan,
Chinese national.

20:23.290 --> 20:24.291
Check this out.

20:24.324 --> 20:25.425
According to the TSA log,

20:25.458 --> 20:26.693
Erica had a doctor's note

20:26.726 --> 20:28.895
approving her travel with her
portable oxygen concentrator.

20:28.928 --> 20:30.430
It's a breathing apparatus.

20:30.463 --> 20:31.898
How many healthy-looking
young women in their 20s

20:31.931 --> 20:33.600
suffer from emphysema?

20:33.633 --> 20:35.868
Not many. This is
our white noise generator.

20:37.470 --> 20:39.672
And Erica Chan is our hijacker.

20:39.706 --> 20:40.707
(thunder crashing)

20:48.615 --> 20:51.418
All right, 68 minutes before
that flight runs out of fuel.

20:51.451 --> 20:52.852
That's less than
a quarter of a tank left.

20:52.885 --> 20:54.487
What the hell
is Erica Chan after?

20:54.521 --> 20:56.823
Well, she went to one of
the top universities in China.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.058
She majored in computer science.

20:59.091 --> 21:01.861
Why come to America
and hijack a plane?

21:01.894 --> 21:04.564
Is she a terrorist?

21:04.597 --> 21:06.599
A dozen major U.S. cities
within her reach.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.067
Terrorist MO is
to make a statement.

21:08.100 --> 21:09.802
You hijack a plane to crash it.

21:09.836 --> 21:12.672
You hold passengers hostage,
then you make demands.

21:12.705 --> 21:14.307
None of that's
happened.

21:14.341 --> 21:16.643
Erica Chan has something else
in store for this plane.

21:16.676 --> 21:18.345
RAMIREZ:
I found another intrusion.

21:18.378 --> 21:19.679
Tampa Bay Drugs.

21:19.712 --> 21:20.947
Pharmacy is near the airport.

21:20.980 --> 21:24.551
Erica Chan prescribed herself 20
milligrams of liquid morphine.

21:24.584 --> 21:26.553
That's powerful stuff.
RYAN: Take a little,

21:26.586 --> 21:27.554
it'll knock you out.

21:27.587 --> 21:28.921
You take a lot, it'll kill you.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.991
All right, so Erica
Chan hijacks a plane

21:32.024 --> 21:33.926
and brings along a
powerful sedative.

21:33.960 --> 21:35.628
What's her plan?

21:35.662 --> 21:38.498
The plane was just
the first step.

21:38.531 --> 21:42.335
I think Miss Chan is after
someone on that flight.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.737
MAN:
Thank you.

21:53.680 --> 21:55.782
Hi. Is that seat taken?

21:55.815 --> 21:58.851
Oh, um, here, take the aisle.

21:58.885 --> 22:00.620
The window's always
a little cold.

22:00.653 --> 22:01.954
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

22:01.988 --> 22:04.023
You know, no matter
what flight I'm on,

22:04.056 --> 22:06.693
I somehow always end up
next to the chatty housewife.

22:06.726 --> 22:08.628
I've had my
fair share.

22:08.661 --> 22:10.863
(polite chuckle)
I recommend a good
pair of headphones.

22:10.897 --> 22:13.400
(chuckles)

22:25.177 --> 22:26.513
Oops.

22:26.546 --> 22:27.947
Oh.

22:27.980 --> 22:29.482
Sorry.
I got you.

22:29.516 --> 22:30.517
Thank you.

22:32.184 --> 22:34.921
Here you go.
Thank you.

22:45.632 --> 22:48.000
Okay, this is a white noise
generator, creates static

22:48.034 --> 22:49.602
across a wide range
of frequencies,

22:49.636 --> 22:50.903
overpowering all
other communications.

22:50.937 --> 22:52.639
So this is why we can't
talk to the plane

22:52.672 --> 22:53.706
and the plane
can't talk to us.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.174
Yeah, and we can't
find the plane

22:55.207 --> 22:56.843
because of the white
noise generator.

22:56.876 --> 22:58.678
And we can't get rid
of the white noise generator

22:58.711 --> 23:01.013
because we're not on the plane.

23:01.047 --> 23:05.051
So we need to find something
that's on the plane,

23:05.084 --> 23:07.620
and still operating,
and allows us to communicate

23:07.654 --> 23:10.623
with Flight 272 despite
the white noise generator.

23:10.657 --> 23:11.791
All right.

23:11.824 --> 23:13.693
(wheels squeaking)

23:15.862 --> 23:17.630
Oh, sorry.

23:17.664 --> 23:20.433
I-I guess I could
use some WD-40.

23:20.467 --> 23:21.868
I-I'm sorry.
KRUMITZ: Yes.

23:21.901 --> 23:23.703
Wait a minute.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.004
Artie, that's it!

23:25.037 --> 23:26.105
It...

23:26.138 --> 23:27.707
Okay, it's-it's
a high-pitched squeak.

23:27.740 --> 23:28.941
What-what-what did I miss?

23:28.975 --> 23:31.644
I don't know, but I love it when
he's excited like this, Artie.

23:33.680 --> 23:36.816
(wheels squeaking)

23:38.685 --> 23:39.952
Ah! Uh...

23:39.986 --> 23:41.654
Ms. Ryan?

23:41.688 --> 23:44.123
Ms. Ryan, I-I wanted to
apologize again for barging in.

23:44.156 --> 23:45.558
Oh, that's
all right, Artie.

23:45.592 --> 23:46.759
This time.

23:46.793 --> 23:47.994
To the point, I was
wondering if maybe, uh,

23:48.027 --> 23:49.896
I could offer you
and your team my services

23:49.929 --> 23:50.930
on a more official level.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.765
What I'm trying
to say is:

23:52.799 --> 23:54.934
do you take on, um, civilian
partners-- consultants?

23:54.967 --> 23:56.703
Our budget's a little
tight at this time.

23:56.736 --> 23:58.037
Uh, I get it,
I really do.

23:58.070 --> 24:00.039
I'm very affordable;
ridiculously so.

24:00.072 --> 24:02.942
I was thinking maybe I could
share some of my specialties

24:02.975 --> 24:04.544
and maybe pick up
a few new ones.

24:04.577 --> 24:06.513
You've got very smart
people that work here.

24:06.546 --> 24:10.049
We could think of it as a kind
of a... um, an internship.

24:10.082 --> 24:13.052
You see, I really
just enjoy

24:13.085 --> 24:15.722
hanging around with you guys,
and I was looking forward

24:15.755 --> 24:17.223
to maybe getting
to know you better.

24:17.256 --> 24:19.225
RAMIREZ:
Avery?

24:19.258 --> 24:20.693
There's a U.S. marshal
that needs to talk to you.

24:20.727 --> 24:22.562
Uh, I'll take
the call in my office.

24:22.595 --> 24:23.563
Actually,
she's here.

24:23.596 --> 24:24.831
She's coming up.

24:24.864 --> 24:25.832
Thank you.

24:25.865 --> 24:27.534
You're welcome.

24:31.003 --> 24:32.839
Deputy Director,
my office found

24:32.872 --> 24:34.607
a complication with
your missing plane.

24:34.641 --> 24:37.243
I've got a U.S. marshal
on board, Irvin Minkler.

24:37.276 --> 24:38.911
Flying under
a pseudonym, I assume,

24:38.945 --> 24:41.180
which is why a marshal didn't
come up on the flight manifest.

24:41.213 --> 24:42.348
I really can't
disclose...

24:42.381 --> 24:45.752
Ms. Stoller, I'm not interested
in DoJ protocol right now.

24:45.785 --> 24:48.020
Mr. Minkler is on the job,
or you wouldn't be here.

24:48.054 --> 24:51.891
So is it witness protection,
or is it prisoner transport?

24:51.924 --> 24:53.893
The nature of this particular
case is very sensitive.

24:53.926 --> 24:55.862
Witness protection it is.

24:55.895 --> 24:58.598
We have reason to believe
that this woman is targeting

24:58.631 --> 25:00.066
someone on our
missing flight.

25:00.099 --> 25:01.200
Erica Chan?

25:01.233 --> 25:03.736
If this woman is
on that flight,

25:03.770 --> 25:04.771
you can be sure she's there
to kill my witness.

25:11.644 --> 25:14.080
STOLLER: Erica Chan's target
is a 16-year-old girl

25:14.113 --> 25:15.347
named Natalie Roth.

25:15.381 --> 25:17.850
She was taking out the trash in
the alley behind her apartment

25:17.884 --> 25:18.951
and witnessed a murder.

25:18.985 --> 25:20.953
Now, I'm breaking protocol here,

25:20.987 --> 25:23.623
but she's been living under
the alias Rebecca Taylor.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.758
RYAN: I know that
name, Rebecca Taylor.

25:25.792 --> 25:27.994
She's one of the girls coming
back from that volleyball trip.

25:29.295 --> 25:30.196
STOLLER: Yeah,
we reluctantly agreed

25:30.229 --> 25:31.931
to let her go on
this trip for school.

25:31.964 --> 25:34.133
We thought we could
keep her safe.

25:34.166 --> 25:35.802
A young girl
witnesses a murder,

25:35.835 --> 25:38.270
and she and her entire family
end up in witness protection?

25:38.304 --> 25:40.607
The murderer in question

25:40.640 --> 25:42.875
is a lieutenant
in the Chinese Triads.

25:42.909 --> 25:45.211
They made sure
three other witnesses

25:45.244 --> 25:47.179
turned up dead
in the last year alone.

25:47.213 --> 25:49.215
And Erica Chan's trying
to make that an even four.

25:49.248 --> 25:53.185
She managed to track down
a witness, hijack a plane--

25:53.219 --> 25:55.187
how far will she go
to kill Rebecca Taylor?

25:55.221 --> 25:57.724
The Triads don't like
to be disappointed.

25:57.757 --> 26:00.192
She will kill her mark
or die trying.

26:03.730 --> 26:05.164
Like Artie's squeaky cart,

26:05.197 --> 26:06.833
the missing plane's in-flight
entertainment system

26:06.866 --> 26:08.968
communicates at a
very high frequency.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.637
We should be able
to hear that frequency

26:10.670 --> 26:11.738
over the white
noise generator.

26:11.771 --> 26:12.839
All right, so the
plane's squeaking.

26:12.872 --> 26:14.073
We just need
to listen.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.242
KRUMITZ: Exactly. And using
ground stations and satellites,

26:16.275 --> 26:18.377
(radar pinging)
we should be able to hear it.

26:18.410 --> 26:19.812
Well, what exactly
are we listening for?

26:19.846 --> 26:22.782
Anything transmitting
at 30,000 feet.

26:22.815 --> 26:24.250
Wait a minute, guys,
we have a bigger problem here.

26:24.283 --> 26:26.919
Anthony Briggs,
the copilot--

26:26.953 --> 26:29.789
he's got an implanted
insulin pump.

26:29.822 --> 26:32.792
It communicates with a receiver
using radio frequencies.

26:32.825 --> 26:33.926
KRUMITZ: You're right.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.795
The white noise generator
would interfere with that.

26:35.828 --> 26:36.996
Which is definitely
not good.

26:37.029 --> 26:38.965
I mean, his device could just
decide to empty its contents.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.835
We're talking a lethal dose
of insulin for the copilot.

26:42.869 --> 26:44.370
Would the copilot even
know what was happening?

26:44.403 --> 26:45.705
I mean,
could he stop it?

26:45.738 --> 26:46.939
Not until it's too late.

26:46.973 --> 26:49.809
We need to find that plane and
get that man to a hospital.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.811
Avery, I have
more bad news.

26:51.844 --> 26:54.380
Wait, we're on course,
but this can't be right.

26:54.413 --> 26:56.048
They've got us hundreds
of miles off the shoreline,

26:56.082 --> 26:57.684
when we should be heading
in for a landing.

26:57.717 --> 26:58.851
I need a...

26:58.885 --> 27:01.287
I need...
Anthony. Anthony.

27:01.320 --> 27:02.421
I need a shot.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.223
(syringe rattles onto floor)
Anthony!

27:05.157 --> 27:06.325
Anthony!

27:18.370 --> 27:20.039
(syringe clatters onto floor)

27:20.072 --> 27:23.375
(sighing heavily)

27:23.409 --> 27:24.443
(radar pinging)
KRUMITZ: We got it.

27:24.476 --> 27:25.678
We've located the plane's

27:25.712 --> 27:27.113
entertainment system's
frequency.

27:27.146 --> 27:27.814
We found Flight 272.

27:27.847 --> 27:29.348
NELSON: All right, pulling up

27:29.381 --> 27:30.449
a live satellite image
of its location now.

27:30.482 --> 27:33.185
It's confirmed, Colonel,
send them out.

27:33.219 --> 27:34.153
Pentagon's scrambling
fighter jets.

27:34.186 --> 27:35.922
They should make contact
with the airline pilot

27:35.955 --> 27:37.023
within minutes.

27:38.791 --> 27:40.092
Something's troubling you.

27:40.126 --> 27:41.994
What is Erica Chan waiting for?

27:42.028 --> 27:43.229
She's on that plane,

27:43.262 --> 27:46.398
she's within striking distance
of her target.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.334
If she'd already killed
Rebecca Taylor,

27:48.367 --> 27:50.937
she'd want that plane
to land as soon as possible.

27:50.970 --> 27:52.805
Why is that plane
still airborne?

27:52.839 --> 27:53.940
You're right, the longer
she's in the air,

27:53.973 --> 27:55.274
the higher the chance
she gets caught.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.109
Erica must know that.

27:57.143 --> 27:58.811
Okay, I uncovered
several failed attempts

27:58.845 --> 28:00.279
to hack the WITSEC database.

28:00.312 --> 28:02.114
That's not how Erica
got the flight info.

28:02.148 --> 28:05.818
Instead, she found a weak link:
a low-level marshal

28:05.852 --> 28:07.854
fell victim to a classic
spearfishing campaign.

28:07.887 --> 28:09.789
MUNDO:
Leaked the flight number

28:09.822 --> 28:11.924
and the U.S. marshal
transporting the witness.

28:11.958 --> 28:12.992
What about the witness's name?

28:13.025 --> 28:14.794
I don't see it
anywhere here.

28:16.462 --> 28:19.098
Wait, that's what
Erica's waiting for.

28:19.131 --> 28:20.933
She doesn't know
who the target is.

28:20.967 --> 28:24.170
That's why she diverted the
plane with the flight-plan hack.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.071
She wanted
to make sure

28:25.104 --> 28:27.306
she had enough time
to locate her target.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.308
Rebecca Taylor is traveling
with her volleyball team.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.077
The marshal would keep
his distance tailing,

28:31.110 --> 28:32.979
rather than draw attention.

28:33.012 --> 28:34.480
Marshal's not sitting
with the witness.

28:34.513 --> 28:36.816
And if Erica has identified
the marshal, he's in danger.

28:36.849 --> 28:38.785
We need to find
a way to warn him.

28:38.818 --> 28:39.651
I may have a way to do that.

28:39.685 --> 28:41.888
The same in-flight
entertainment system

28:41.921 --> 28:42.889
we used to track the plane

28:42.922 --> 28:44.791
is equipped with
passenger-to-passenger texting.

28:44.824 --> 28:46.793
Yeah, those things do way more
than just show movies.

28:46.826 --> 28:49.295
You can use those to chat
with friends, order drinks...

28:49.328 --> 28:51.197
Can use it to send the
marshal a warning.
NELSON: I'm on it.

28:52.264 --> 28:53.065
Checking the manifest.

28:53.099 --> 28:55.201
All right, I got it.
He's in seat 7C.

28:55.234 --> 28:56.102
Yeah, wait a minute, though.

28:56.135 --> 28:56.969
We don't know what's
going on up there.

28:57.003 --> 28:58.337
And instead of warning
the air marshal,

28:58.370 --> 28:59.171
we might be alerting Erica

28:59.205 --> 29:00.372
to the fact
that we're on to her.

29:00.406 --> 29:02.074
That's a risk we have to take.

29:04.543 --> 29:06.212
(bell chiming)

29:21.861 --> 29:23.963
(blipping)

29:35.274 --> 29:36.843
KRUMITZ:
We got a response.

29:36.876 --> 29:38.510
"Give me the witness's name,

29:38.544 --> 29:40.246
or I'll drop this plane
out of the sky."

29:40.279 --> 29:42.248
(sighs)
Erica got to the marshal.

29:42.281 --> 29:44.250
We're too late.

29:44.283 --> 29:49.188
This hijacking just turned
into a standoff at 30,000 feet.

29:51.991 --> 29:53.359
FIGHTER PILOT: Negative comms
with aircraft.

29:53.392 --> 29:55.361
Utilizing flashlights
at this time.

29:55.394 --> 29:56.628
Yes, sir, I'll pass that along.

29:56.662 --> 30:00.466
Fighter pilots have made visual
contact with Flight 272's pilot.

30:00.499 --> 30:01.901
They're escorting
him in for a landing.

30:01.934 --> 30:03.102
Make sure they're aware
of the situation.

30:03.135 --> 30:05.571
Report any change in status.

30:05.604 --> 30:07.439
We don't know what Erica Chan
is capable of.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.942
She said she could drop that
plane out of the sky.

30:09.976 --> 30:11.944
We know that she's
a proficient hacker,

30:11.978 --> 30:13.479
but can she do that?

30:14.546 --> 30:16.348
MUNDO:
Air Force pilots are reporting

30:16.382 --> 30:17.884
that Flight 272
is falling, fast.

30:17.917 --> 30:20.419
She saw the jets.
This is her counterattack.

30:20.452 --> 30:23.122
Mayday, mayday.
This is Argus 272.

30:23.155 --> 30:25.958
If anyone is reading me,
we are losing thrust.

30:25.992 --> 30:27.593
(alarm blaring)
Throttle not responding.

30:27.626 --> 30:30.029
My first officer is
in need of medical attention.

30:30.062 --> 30:33.265
We are losing altitude.
Repeat, we are losing altitude.

30:33.299 --> 30:35.001
Can anyone read me?

30:35.034 --> 30:37.203
(passengers gasping, murmuring)

30:43.409 --> 30:44.643
(gasping)
Oh, God!

30:44.676 --> 30:45.511
GIRL:
Are you all right?

30:45.544 --> 30:47.113
(everyone talking at once)

30:52.684 --> 30:54.921
(keypad blipping)

30:57.556 --> 30:59.458
How did Erica just do that?

30:59.491 --> 31:01.160
The only thing
I can think of, uh...

31:01.193 --> 31:03.329
hard-wire in through the plane's
entertainment system.

31:03.362 --> 31:04.964
She must be issuing
commands through

31:04.997 --> 31:06.065
the thrust-management
computer.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.333
Erica has control
of the engines!

31:07.366 --> 31:08.901
ARTIE: (clears throat)
A security researcher

31:08.935 --> 31:10.569
claimed to have done it
successfully,

31:10.602 --> 31:13.072
but the airlines are all
denying that it's possible.

31:13.105 --> 31:14.941
Typical big business:
Deny the problem

31:14.974 --> 31:15.942
and hope that it goes away.

31:15.975 --> 31:17.409
How do we stop
Erica Chan?

31:17.443 --> 31:18.911
We're already in communication

31:18.945 --> 31:20.079
with the in-flight
entertainment system.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.014
I should be able to
kick Erica off.

31:22.048 --> 31:23.482
And if that doesn't work,
what's our backup plan?

31:23.515 --> 31:25.151
(clears throat) Uh, well,
worst-case scenario,

31:25.184 --> 31:28.020
the pilot might be able
to pull the onboard computer,

31:28.054 --> 31:30.322
but that would leave the plane
with only partial hydraulics.

31:30.356 --> 31:31.623
But... he should have

31:31.657 --> 31:33.392
full control
of the engines again.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.493
That would make the plane
tough as hell to fly.

31:34.526 --> 31:36.963
It'd be like
a school bus with wings.

31:36.996 --> 31:37.997
You'd need to be
an incredibly skilled pilot

31:38.030 --> 31:39.465
to bring that plane down safely.

31:39.498 --> 31:41.267
RYAN:
With the copilot sick,

31:41.300 --> 31:43.002
he would have to do it
all by himself.

31:43.035 --> 31:44.136
That doesn't help
his chances.

31:44.170 --> 31:44.971
KRUMITZ:
Artie's right.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.672
The only way to
ensure Erica Chan

31:46.705 --> 31:47.673
can't take control
of the aircraft

31:47.706 --> 31:48.607
is to pull that computer.

31:48.640 --> 31:51.310
Artie, I need to know
exactly what happens

31:51.343 --> 31:53.279
if you unplug a
commercial airliner's

31:53.312 --> 31:55.114
onboard computer
in flight.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.683
If we go this route,
I don't want any surprises.

31:57.716 --> 31:58.951
Yes, ma'am.

31:59.551 --> 32:01.420
Raven, try to kick
Erica off.

32:01.453 --> 32:03.155
I'll buy you time.
Okay.

32:03.189 --> 32:06.325
Krumitz, compose
a message to Ms. Chan.

32:06.358 --> 32:09.962
This is Deputy Director
Avery Ryan. FBI Cyber.

32:09.996 --> 32:11.097
It's time to negotiate.

32:18.137 --> 32:19.205
(typing rapidly)

32:22.008 --> 32:23.709
KRUMITZ: Give me the name
and we all go home.

32:23.742 --> 32:25.311
Doesn't sound like
she's interested.

32:25.344 --> 32:28.047
She sounds in control,
but she's panicking.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.382
Talking to the FBI couldn't have
been part of her plan.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.084
"Give me the name."
That means the she didn't

32:32.118 --> 32:34.286
get the witness's name
from the marshal.

32:34.320 --> 32:36.122
She is out of options;
she needs an out.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.157
Let's see what happens
if we push her.

32:38.190 --> 32:39.458
Erica.

32:39.491 --> 32:42.128
It's over. You've failed.

32:50.569 --> 32:53.439
(sighs) "Either I kill
the witness

32:53.472 --> 32:54.473
or I kill us all.
Your choice."

33:05.051 --> 33:06.785
The fighter pilots have been
given shoot-down authority.

33:06.818 --> 33:08.587
If the plane gets too close
to a metropolitan area,

33:08.620 --> 33:10.489
while still under
Erica Chan's control,

33:10.522 --> 33:12.024
the fighter jets
will fire.

33:12.058 --> 33:12.758
At the speed
they're traveling...

33:12.791 --> 33:14.260
That's less than ten minutes!

33:14.293 --> 33:15.461
(sighs) Raven...

33:15.494 --> 33:17.029
I'm working as fast
as I can.

33:17.063 --> 33:18.664
Even if I do succeed,
there's a bigger problem:

33:18.697 --> 33:21.500
Once I kick Erica off
the plane's system,

33:21.533 --> 33:24.336
there's no way of stopping her
from hacking back in.

33:24.370 --> 33:26.372
We need someone on board to get
her computer away from her.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.179
(blipping)

33:44.390 --> 33:45.824
Ma'am...

33:45.857 --> 33:47.226
I'm gonna need that computer.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.095
Okay.

33:49.595 --> 33:51.230
(passengers screaming)

33:51.263 --> 33:53.099
(alarm blaring)
REYNOLDS: Somebody! Anybody!

33:53.132 --> 33:54.100
Can anybody hear me?

33:54.866 --> 33:57.769
(passengers shouting,
screaming)

34:08.314 --> 34:10.482
Mayday! Mayday!
This is Argus 272.

34:10.516 --> 34:13.219
If anyone is reading me,
I have lost the engines.

34:14.553 --> 34:16.655
I'm gonna do my best
to maintain glide speed.

34:20.659 --> 34:22.594
Fighter pilots
have taken tactical positions,

34:22.628 --> 34:23.795
armed with short-range
air-to-air missiles.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.365
They will fire on that plane
to save lives on the ground.

34:26.398 --> 34:28.234
Tell them to hold off
as long as they can.

34:28.267 --> 34:29.835
Raven, why is that
plane still falling?

34:29.868 --> 34:30.836
Looks like Erica Chan's

34:30.869 --> 34:32.238
final act of vengeance

34:32.271 --> 34:33.739
was to zero out
the plane's thrust.

34:33.772 --> 34:35.741
Pilot won't be able
to overpower the autopilot.

34:35.774 --> 34:36.842
We're out of options.

34:37.876 --> 34:38.644
Artie!

34:38.677 --> 34:40.112
(alarms blaring)

34:41.347 --> 34:42.881
Artie,
how safe is it for the pilot

34:42.914 --> 34:44.316
to unplug that computer?

34:44.350 --> 34:45.817
From what I can tell,

34:45.851 --> 34:47.018
if the pilot disconnects
the onboard computer,

34:47.052 --> 34:49.221
he should be able to regain
full control of the engines

34:49.255 --> 34:51.390
without any undesirable
side effects, but--

34:51.423 --> 34:52.591
he'd have to readjust fast.

34:52.624 --> 34:53.792
That's our plan.

34:53.825 --> 34:56.362
How do we get the pilot
that message?

34:56.395 --> 34:58.530
The entertainment system can't
communicate with the cockpit.

34:58.564 --> 35:00.499
The jets may have a way
to pass that along.

35:01.633 --> 35:03.169
REYNOLDS:
What the hell was that?

35:04.436 --> 35:07.239
That pilot is sending
a distress signal.

35:07.273 --> 35:09.275
We're gonna have to
pull the computer.

35:12.278 --> 35:14.613
What've we got to lose?

35:21.920 --> 35:23.121
Oh!

35:26.458 --> 35:29.661
(passengers screaming)

35:29.695 --> 35:31.230
Is this gonna work?

35:31.263 --> 35:33.499
If this doesn't work,
nothing will.

35:36.835 --> 35:38.437
Fighter jets
are prepared to fire.

35:45.311 --> 35:46.178
REYNOLDS: Come on!

35:59.425 --> 36:00.926
Pilot has regained
control of the plane.

36:00.959 --> 36:02.328
(all cheering, whooping)

36:02.361 --> 36:03.462
That's what
I'm talking ' about!

36:03.495 --> 36:05.431
KRUMITZ:
Oh, yeah!

36:08.900 --> 36:10.902
(gasping)

36:13.272 --> 36:14.306
(sighs with relief)

36:14.340 --> 36:15.541
Yeah!

36:15.574 --> 36:16.875
Yes!

36:17.843 --> 36:19.278
Good work, Mr. Sneed.

36:19.311 --> 36:21.613
Well, good guessing, really,
but... thank you.

36:24.683 --> 36:26.718
(sirens wailing)

36:47.439 --> 36:50.342
(low, indistinct
conversation)

36:52.378 --> 36:53.412
All right, ma'am.

36:53.445 --> 36:55.981
You're gonna need
to come with me.

36:56.014 --> 36:58.284
REYNOLDS:
...and, most importantly,

36:58.317 --> 37:00.652
I'd like to thank everybody
who brought us home today.

37:00.686 --> 37:02.254
I couldn't have done it alone.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.856
It was nice to know we had
a great team on the ground,

37:04.890 --> 37:05.891
watching our backs.

37:05.924 --> 37:07.893
They're the ones who helped me

37:07.926 --> 37:10.596
land my aircraft safely.

37:10.629 --> 37:12.598
(applause)

37:33.419 --> 37:35.053
Should I get you a cot?

37:35.086 --> 37:37.389
Oh! No, no, no, no, no, no.

37:37.423 --> 37:38.790
Uh, uh,
I was leaving.

37:38.824 --> 37:41.327
I promise.
I was just, uh...

37:41.360 --> 37:42.394
just finishing up.

37:42.428 --> 37:44.563
It's a patch for the in-flight
entertainment system.

37:44.596 --> 37:46.064
Get that to the FAA,

37:46.097 --> 37:47.899
and air travel
will be safe once again.

37:47.933 --> 37:48.934
Thanks, Artie.

37:49.901 --> 37:52.438
(laughing softly)

37:52.471 --> 37:53.872
It was a hell of a day.

37:53.905 --> 37:56.542
I'm still buzzing
from that victory.

37:56.575 --> 37:57.809
(laughs)

37:57.843 --> 38:00.879
Whew! I'm, uh,
I was gonna go grab a bite.

38:00.912 --> 38:03.349
Um... can I buy you dinner?

38:04.916 --> 38:06.352
Are you asking me on a date?

38:06.385 --> 38:08.854
Well, you're a powerful,
beautiful woman.

38:09.855 --> 38:10.989
You bet I am.

38:11.022 --> 38:13.325
Artie...

38:13.359 --> 38:15.627
I don't date our consultants.

38:15.661 --> 38:17.529
I get it.

38:17.563 --> 38:19.465
I understand.

38:20.632 --> 38:22.033
Wait.

38:23.068 --> 38:25.337
(laughs)
Does this mean I'm a consultant?

38:25.371 --> 38:28.474
But you have to promise
that you'll call first,

38:28.507 --> 38:30.108
'cause I can't guarantee
that the agents

38:30.141 --> 38:32.511
in the lobby
won't see you or your...

38:32.544 --> 38:35.447
cart as a threat and shoot you.

38:35.481 --> 38:37.416
I understand. Yes.

38:37.449 --> 38:39.050
Yes, ma'am.
Artie,

38:39.084 --> 38:41.720
we're the FBI--
we just handshake.

38:42.588 --> 38:44.490
(laughs):
All right.

38:44.523 --> 38:45.657
Good night.

38:48.059 --> 38:49.961
Good night.

38:49.995 --> 38:51.763
(whirring)

38:55.534 --> 38:57.035
(indistinct chatter)

38:57.068 --> 38:58.737
Hey.
RAVEN:
Who!

38:58.770 --> 39:00.105
Ah.
(laughs)

39:00.138 --> 39:01.740
(sighs)
How do I look?

39:01.773 --> 39:03.475
Sharp. Nice wheels.

39:03.509 --> 39:04.376
MUNDO:
Big date?

39:04.410 --> 39:05.544
Uh, sort of. Sort of. Yeah.

39:05.577 --> 39:07.413
Is it cool
if I borrow the drift board?

39:07.446 --> 39:10.148
Yeah, man, no problem--
but I thought Rosalyn
couldn't make it.

39:10.181 --> 39:13.452
Well, she couldn't, but we...
made other arrangements.

39:13.485 --> 39:15.987
Figured who needs patience
when we have technology.

39:16.021 --> 39:19.124
So I'm taking her on a
video chat tour of DC

39:19.157 --> 39:20.592
at night.
(chuckles)

39:20.626 --> 39:21.560
Nice!
Ah!

39:21.593 --> 39:22.761
(electronic dinging)
Oh... ah!

39:22.794 --> 39:24.463
(chuckles)

39:24.496 --> 39:25.997
Okay, she's ready.

39:26.031 --> 39:26.598
Shirt... good?

39:26.632 --> 39:27.933
Aw, you got this, Krummy.

39:27.966 --> 39:29.167
Yeah.
Okay, okay, okay.

39:29.200 --> 39:30.502
Hey!

39:30.536 --> 39:31.870
Hey, how are you?

39:31.903 --> 39:33.672
Okay, ready?
Ready to get started?

39:33.705 --> 39:35.707
All right, this is CTOC.

39:35.741 --> 39:37.709
You remember CTOC. Okay.

39:37.743 --> 39:39.878
These are my friends.

39:40.912 --> 39:42.481
Hey.
KRUMITZ:
Say hi.

39:42.514 --> 39:43.549
Hey, there!
Coop!

39:43.582 --> 39:45.116
That's, uh...
this is Artie.

39:45.150 --> 39:47.419
Um... Artie's
just leaving.

39:47.453 --> 39:49.521
Oh, hey. You want me
to walk you out?

39:51.056 --> 39:52.724
MUNDO: Our little Krummy
went and got himself

39:52.758 --> 39:54.125
a video chat date.
(sighs)

39:54.159 --> 39:56.962
NELSON: Charm her from afar,
then go in for the kill!

39:56.995 --> 39:58.630
That boy, Krummy.

39:58.664 --> 40:01.132
See, that's my...
that's my, that's my dawn!

40:01.166 --> 40:02.167
Come on.
