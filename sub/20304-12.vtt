NARRATOR:
<i>Coming tonight on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.962 --> 00:05.380
Merry Christmas, children.

00:05.463 --> 00:08.174
ALL: Merry Christmas!

00:08.258 --> 00:09.551
What have we got here, Renko?

00:09.634 --> 00:11.261
First victim was ambulanced off to Mercy

00:11.344 --> 00:13.638
with a gunshot to the neck
and over a dozen knife wounds.

00:13.722 --> 00:16.474
-What's the count?
-Seven incidents, three shootings.

00:16.558 --> 00:17.559
You ain't no Santa.

00:17.642 --> 00:20.979
How would you like a nice
crushed vertebra for Christmas, kid?

00:21.062 --> 00:21.980
Good, bad or indifferent,

00:22.063 --> 00:23.690
I'm still your father,
and don't you forget it.

00:23.773 --> 00:26.192
-You never were.
-I killed her husband.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.654
It was an accident, man.
Give yourself a break.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.490
(siren blaring)

00:33.199 --> 00:34.409
Oh, Lordy, it's Christmas Eve,

00:34.492 --> 00:36.578
and I'm gonna get shot dead
in a moose suit!

00:38.246 --> 00:39.539
-(all chattering)
-PHIL: Item ten,

00:39.622 --> 00:41.916
as regards "Operation Santa."

00:42.292 --> 00:45.587
Wherein Detectives Hackley,
Sabatino, and Belker

00:45.670 --> 00:49.049

00:49.382 --> 00:52.719
Rappaport's Department Store,
the Jefferson Avenue Mall,

00:53.053 --> 00:54.721
and the Blue Line subway entrance

00:54.804 --> 00:57.891
at 118th and People's Drive,
respectively.

00:58.725 --> 01:03.480
Item 11, I remind you yet again
of the seasonal increase in suicide,

01:03.563 --> 01:07.942
aggravated assault, D&amp;D,
and your ever-popular homicide.

01:08.026 --> 01:12.155
Pursuant to these grim realities,
I give you Item 12.

01:12.864 --> 01:16.201
Now, let's exhibit sound judgment
out there today,

01:16.493 --> 01:20.205
and hold to a minimum
the nuisance-type busts.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.041
Neither this precinct
nor the courts it serves

01:23.124 --> 01:24.793
-looks kindly...
-Cupid, Comet, Dancer...

01:24.876 --> 01:27.629
...on the last-minute frenzy
of Mickey Mouse arrests,

01:27.712 --> 01:29.255
and attendant paperwork.

01:29.339 --> 01:31.841
The day before Christmas is no time

01:31.925 --> 01:34.761
-to pad your collar count.
-(all groaning, chattering)

01:34.844 --> 01:37.680
Item 13, the Christmas gift drive

01:37.889 --> 01:40.975
for the patients
of All Angels Children's Hospital

01:41.184 --> 01:44.938
under the personal supervision
of Lieutenant Howard Hunter.

01:45.021 --> 01:48.817
(cheering, applauding)

01:48.900 --> 01:51.236
Last-minute gifts
for these young unfortunates

01:51.319 --> 01:54.364
are being wrapped near the front desk
even as we speak,

01:54.656 --> 01:58.076
and delivery of same is scheduled
at 4:30 p.m.

01:58.159 --> 02:00.203

02:05.792 --> 02:09.045
...will convene at 4:15 sharp

02:09.462 --> 02:13.716
For transport to Children's Hospital,
carpooling is recommended.

02:13.883 --> 02:17.220
Appropriate wardrobe for Santa's helpers

02:17.554 --> 02:19.848
has been provided free of charge

02:19.931 --> 02:22.767
by Kowalski's Costume
and Party Supply Rentals.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.310
(all applauding, cheering)

02:24.394 --> 02:28.148
So, uh, leave us keep
these good people in mind, uh,

02:28.231 --> 02:30.733
when we come upon their delivery trucks

02:30.817 --> 02:35.113
occasionally parked
in life's myriad no-loading zones.

02:35.196 --> 02:37.323
(laughter)

02:37.407 --> 02:41.369
Item last, Lieutenant Calletano
has asked me to remind you

02:41.452 --> 02:46.124
of a little holiday celebration
here in Roll Call commencing at 6:00 p.m.

02:46.207 --> 02:48.293
-(whispering)
-So, as you move off to your various

02:48.376 --> 02:50.003
Christmas Eve celebrations,

02:50.086 --> 02:52.505
-take the moment for some good fellowship,
-(laughs)

02:52.839 --> 02:56.843
good groceries,
and non-alcoholic holiday cheer.

02:56.926 --> 02:59.554
-(groans)
-I stress "non-alcoholic..."

02:59.637 --> 03:01.973
-Cupid, Dasher and Vixen.
-...with specific reference to last year's

03:02.056 --> 03:04.142
pair of revelers who, under the influence,

03:04.225 --> 03:07.937
were discovered partaking
of each other's good will semi-naked

03:08.021 --> 03:12.525
in the middle cell
of the garden-level holding facility.

03:12.609 --> 03:16.487
(laughter)

03:17.030 --> 03:19.115
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:19.741 --> 03:22.327
And let's be careful out there.

03:23.203 --> 03:26.956
Hey. Hey, hey, hey! Merry Christmas.

03:27.040 --> 03:29.918
-(chattering)
-Merry Christmas, Sarge.

03:32.754 --> 03:34.964
I like it... I like it
when them little chipmunks sing

03:35.048 --> 03:36.132
in them high voices like that.

03:36.216 --> 03:37.675
They sing them Christmas songs.
I like that a lot.

03:37.759 --> 03:38.968
-Hey. Hey, come on.
-Forget about it.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.136
Don't-don't say that.

03:41.429 --> 03:44.349
-Come on, man, huh?
-J.D., Neal.

03:45.683 --> 03:48.895
Robbery/Assault at the Hotel Richmond,
3500 block of East Utica.

03:48.978 --> 03:50.313
Why can't Washington Heights take it?

03:50.396 --> 03:53.566
-Because it is still our precinct.
-Big deal.

03:53.650 --> 03:56.277
Come on, man.
This is your basic "bah, humbug."

04:01.616 --> 04:03.952
Shot up an all-night laundry.
Miracle nobody got hurt.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.203
Had to use tear gas.

04:06.037 --> 04:06.913
(yells) No!

04:10.166 --> 04:12.877
-Get away!
-MAN: Take it easy!

04:14.003 --> 04:19.342
You got me! (yelling)

04:19.425 --> 04:20.385
(groans)

04:20.468 --> 04:23.930
Hey, you never heard of "peace on Earth,
good will to men," you little creep?

04:30.937 --> 04:35.275
(whistling "Deck The Halls")

04:35.733 --> 04:37.777
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas, Henry.

04:37.860 --> 04:38.695
HENRY: Merry Christmas to you, Howard.

04:38.778 --> 04:40.071
-Who's your friend?
-HOWARD: Ho, ho.

04:40.154 --> 04:43.283
-(chuckles)
-Thank you. Oh, Howard, (clears throat)

04:43.366 --> 04:44.993
I got you a little something
for the hospital.

04:45.076 --> 04:48.329
Oh, thank you, Henry. That's cute.

04:48.663 --> 04:49.914
-Howard?
-Yeah?

04:52.375 --> 04:55.336
Is this really the kind of toy
we want to be giving to these children?

04:55.420 --> 04:59.173
Henry, unlike some knee-jerk, liberal,
Chicken Littles,

04:59.257 --> 05:02.885
who believe that toy guns are harmful
to a child's psyche,

05:03.094 --> 05:06.973
I am convinced that they provide

05:07.056 --> 05:10.393
harmless ventilation
for juvenile aggression.

05:10.476 --> 05:14.772
You know, this is really a very nice
knockoff, Ballantine.

05:14.856 --> 05:16.607
(machine gun fire)

05:16.691 --> 05:19.944
-(clattering)
-(groans)

05:20.528 --> 05:21.821
(telephone rings)

05:22.530 --> 05:23.865
Judas H. Christmas.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.285
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

05:27.368 --> 05:29.037
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:29.120 --> 05:32.957
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:33.041 --> 05:34.625
(sirens wailing)

05:40.089 --> 05:44.010
(theme music playing)

06:46.697 --> 06:52.370
(siren blaring)

06:53.162 --> 06:54.205
RENKO: You all want to move aside, please?

06:54.288 --> 06:57.500
Let me get this poor woman out of here.
All right. Take this thing down.

06:57.834 --> 07:00.420
Make some kind of report,
and I'll deal with the suits out here.

07:00.503 --> 07:02.839
Be real careful going down the stairs,
and get this thing out.

07:02.922 --> 07:06.092
If you want a motorcycle escort
or something, go ahead and ask for it.

07:06.884 --> 07:09.470
-They don't need one?
-What have you got here, Renko?

07:09.554 --> 07:11.264
The first victim was ambulanced
off to Mercy

07:11.347 --> 07:13.141
with a gunshot and about a dozen
knife wounds.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.434
We got a second victim right over there.

07:14.517 --> 07:18.438
With several witnesses describe the
perpetrators as either four male Latinos,

07:18.521 --> 07:20.565
or three male Blacks, take your pick,

07:20.648 --> 07:22.650
fleeing the premises in a light blue
or possibly yellow

07:22.733 --> 07:24.819
late-model Ford or Pontiac,
take your pick.

07:24.902 --> 07:26.863
Said perps come
in assorted heights, weights,

07:26.946 --> 07:29.073
distinguishing characteristics,
et cetera, et cetera.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.950
Get 'em over to the station and run 'em
through the mug books.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.493
How clever. Why didn't I think of that?

07:33.202 --> 07:36.789
-Hey, you got a problem with me, Renko?
-Do I? Yes, as a matter of fact, I do.

07:36.873 --> 07:40.084
Anybody that brings an attitude like
you got to me the day before Christmas

07:40.168 --> 07:42.170
-is gonna have a problem.
-Hey, look. You want it, you got it.

07:42.253 --> 07:43.713
Neal, man, hey. Whoa, come on.

07:43.796 --> 07:46.424
Hey, let's canvass the neighborhood.
We'll let the guy do his thing.

07:46.507 --> 07:48.050
-Now, come on. Come on.
-(siren blaring)

07:48.134 --> 07:51.053
Further felicitations of the season
to you too, good buddy.

07:51.137 --> 07:54.056
-(bell tinkling)
-Merry Christmas.

07:54.140 --> 07:56.142
Ho, ho, ho.

07:57.018 --> 08:01.898
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho, ho.

08:02.648 --> 08:05.735
Merry Christmas, lady.

08:05.818 --> 08:09.614
-Oh, ho.
-(choir singing)

08:09.697 --> 08:12.700
Merry Christmas.

08:13.576 --> 08:17.497
<i>♪ O Christmas tree, O Christmas tree ♪</i>

08:18.372 --> 08:20.791
-What?
-You ain't no Santa.

08:21.250 --> 08:24.128
-The hell I'm not.
-You're too ugly to be a Santa.

08:24.795 --> 08:28.257
-Come on, kid. Take a powder.
-Rotate on it, slim.

08:28.341 --> 08:33.095
Hey, hey. How would you like a nice,
crushed vertebra for Christmas, kid?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.555
-You know what I think?
-What?

08:34.639 --> 08:36.390
-I think you're a cop.
-Hey. Hey.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.560
-I'm right, ain't I?
-Just keep it down, will ya?

08:39.852 --> 08:41.479
What's the scam here, Jack?

08:42.688 --> 08:44.815
-(coins jingling)
-Look, kid.

08:45.024 --> 08:46.567
Here's a couple of bucks. What do you say?

08:46.651 --> 08:48.945
You want to go to a movie or something?
Get lost?

08:49.237 --> 08:50.863
Come on, beat it.

08:51.864 --> 08:55.826
-Check you later, Mr. Policeman.
-(growls)

08:55.910 --> 09:00.498
I am drunk, I am disorderly,

09:00.915 --> 09:04.710
and I am prepared to be arrested.

09:04.794 --> 09:06.420
Sir, you're not drunk enough,

09:06.504 --> 09:08.965
and you're not disorderly enough
to be arrested.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.801
Now, have a candy cane
and get on out of here.

09:11.884 --> 09:13.553
You ain't hearing me, white boy.

09:13.636 --> 09:17.932
I said I wanna be arrested and serve time

09:18.015 --> 09:21.018
at the Michigan Avenue complex.

09:21.102 --> 09:22.228
-Come on.
-Uh, Leo?

09:22.311 --> 09:24.146
-What seems to be the trouble, huh?
-(sighs)

09:24.230 --> 09:25.690
This guy wants to be arrested

09:25.773 --> 09:29.443
so he can have Christmas dinner
at the Michigan Avenue complex.

09:29.735 --> 09:34.031
Sir, why don't you just mosey over
to Jefferson Avenue Men's Shelter?

09:34.532 --> 09:37.034
They serve up a mighty fine
Christmas dinner.

09:37.118 --> 09:42.206
(chuckles) See? You don't know nothin'.
They serve ham over there.

09:42.665 --> 09:46.877
I cannot eat ham.
It "disconveniences" my stomach.

09:47.795 --> 09:52.508
They serve turkey
at the Michigan Avenue complex.

09:52.592 --> 09:55.344
Well, you're gonna have to commit
a substantial misdemeanor

09:55.428 --> 09:57.430
before we can incarcerate you.

09:57.513 --> 10:00.266
You want substantial?
I've got your substantial.

10:00.349 --> 10:06.564
Hey, mama! Check this out.
I'm buck naked! (cackles)

10:06.647 --> 10:08.691
Can't somebody arrest this pervert?

10:08.774 --> 10:10.651
Insufficient evidence, Mrs. Furillo.

10:10.735 --> 10:13.946
-Okay, buck, you win your turkey. Come on.
-(man cackling)

10:14.030 --> 10:16.824
Two of the people from the market
were taken over to Saint John's.

10:16.907 --> 10:20.369
Beaten unconscious with baseball bats.
One of them a 65-year-old lady.

10:20.828 --> 10:22.455
-Same four guys, Lieutenant.
-(sighs)

10:24.749 --> 10:26.959
You know, nothing ever changes
around here, Frank?

10:27.043 --> 10:28.169
-What?
-(door slams)

10:28.252 --> 10:30.630
Well, I was just accosted
by a naked pervert.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.007
What kind of person does that the day
before Christmas?

10:33.090 --> 10:35.468
Fay, I have a ton of work to finish
before I leave here tonight.

10:35.551 --> 10:37.428
Have you packed Frank Jr.'s suitcase yet?

10:37.511 --> 10:40.723
Well, uh, Frank,
I'm having second thoughts.

10:40.806 --> 10:44.226
We're leaving on a seven o'clock flight,
Fay. It's too late for second thoughts.

10:44.685 --> 10:46.896
-Yeah, but what if he gets hurt?
-He's not gonna get hurt.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.273
It's three days on the bunny slope,
not the Swiss Alps.

10:49.357 --> 10:52.443
Besides which, it was your idea
for us to take him with us

10:52.693 --> 10:54.904
so you could go to Bermuda
with Judge "what's-his-name."

10:54.987 --> 10:56.989
Frank. Oh, excuse me, Mrs. Furillo.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.284
Frank, Bates and Coffey brought in
two more robbery/assault victims.

11:00.368 --> 11:02.119
Same MO as the welfare hotel.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.205
God's sake,
that's the third one this morning.

11:04.288 --> 11:06.582
And we just got word
on another one in the Heights.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.960
Let's coordinate with Jack Armetta up
there. No sense in duplicating efforts.

11:10.044 --> 11:11.295
Do we have these people
going through the mug books?

11:11.379 --> 11:14.256
Sure. Sure. And I've got Rich Velasquez
working on composites.

11:14.340 --> 11:15.299
Good. Keep me posted.

11:16.300 --> 11:17.968
RAY: Merry Christmas, Mrs. Furillo.

11:18.052 --> 11:21.764
-Oh, thank you, Ray. Same to you and Rosa.
-(in Spanish)<i> Gracias.</i>

11:24.058 --> 11:25.351
-Now, Frank--
-(door closes)

11:25.893 --> 11:29.313
I have all Frank Jr.'s presents
right here, but you have to promise me

11:29.397 --> 11:31.774
that you'll get a nice little
Christmas tree to put them under.

11:31.857 --> 11:32.942
You know, he's had a Christmas tree

11:33.025 --> 11:34.568
-every year of his--
-He'll have a tree.

11:34.777 --> 11:37.029
And-and, Frank, whatever you do,

11:37.113 --> 11:40.157
please, please don't forget
to hang his stocking.

11:40.241 --> 11:43.369
It's the first thing he looks for
when he gets up on Christmas morning.

11:43.452 --> 11:46.706
And I've already filled it, you know,
with little-little presents and...

11:47.415 --> 11:49.166
and candy, and things, you know, that--

11:49.750 --> 11:52.712
But the five-and-dime was out of those
little caramel swirls

11:52.795 --> 11:54.588
(voice breaking) that he's used to and--

11:57.633 --> 12:00.511
Fay. It's-it's all right.

12:01.178 --> 12:03.222
(sniffles) Well, it hurts, Frank.

12:04.306 --> 12:07.435
You know, it's-- it's the first year
that I won't be with him,

12:07.518 --> 12:09.437
and-and with you gone too--

12:12.022 --> 12:14.400
I hate palm trees at this time of year.

12:15.025 --> 12:17.987
I'll call you at your hotel the moment
he starts opening presents

12:18.070 --> 12:20.489
so you can be in on it
every minute of the time.

12:21.449 --> 12:23.743
-(chuckling) Okay?
-(sighs)

12:24.910 --> 12:28.289
Remember our first Christmas together?
I mean, as a family?

12:28.873 --> 12:31.834
We were in the Lynwood Avenue apartment.
Frank Jr. was about four months old.

12:31.917 --> 12:35.963
-Aw.
-(both chuckle)

12:36.046 --> 12:39.175
I must have spent half the night trying
to put that tricycle of his together,

12:39.258 --> 12:43.053
and I sat on it for one second
and it broke into about 48 pieces.

12:43.137 --> 12:47.308
(both laughing)

12:48.100 --> 12:49.935
I think that was our best Christmas ever.

12:52.188 --> 12:53.481
Listen, Frank, um...

12:54.148 --> 12:57.485
When you get back, do you think we could
have Christmas dinner together?

12:57.568 --> 13:01.030
I mean, the three of us.
I know it'll be a couple days late, but...

13:02.198 --> 13:06.076
-It'd kind of be like old times.
-Yes. I'd like that a lot.

13:10.289 --> 13:14.001
Oh, Bobby? There's a gentleman
over by the front desk to see you.

13:32.603 --> 13:34.230
Uh, what brings you to town?

13:34.730 --> 13:38.442
What brings me to town? (laughs)
What kind of question is that?

13:38.734 --> 13:42.154
I'm here to spend Christmas
with my one and only son.

13:42.863 --> 13:45.115
-What else?
-And damn, you look good, boy.

13:45.199 --> 13:46.200
You look like aces.

13:46.283 --> 13:47.117
As a matter of fact,
you look better than aces.

13:47.201 --> 13:49.036
You look downright flush.

13:49.119 --> 13:50.788
What else brings you to town?

13:51.413 --> 13:54.041
(laughs) Listen at you, boy.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.378
Soundin' like one of these
police interrogators.

13:57.461 --> 13:58.379
'Course, now that you mention it,

13:58.462 --> 14:01.966
I do have a little end-of-the-fiscal-year
business to conduct

14:02.049 --> 14:02.883
with some local associates,

14:02.967 --> 14:06.512
but primarily, we are talking
about a family visit here, son.

14:07.304 --> 14:09.181
Merry Christmas to you, boy.

14:09.473 --> 14:13.477
Go on. (chuckling)

14:17.231 --> 14:19.775
Why do you want to write me a check
for $500?

14:20.401 --> 14:24.363
Oh, be-because it's Christmas. (chuckles)
And I have always said

14:24.446 --> 14:28.075
a man can never be too long on a little
pocket change come the holidays.

14:28.409 --> 14:29.660
'Course, only 350 of that's for you,

14:29.743 --> 14:31.620
the other 100 and a half being sorely
needed by your old man.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.664
That is,
if you got the spare cash on hand.

14:34.415 --> 14:35.583
On account of that being
an out-of-state check,

14:35.666 --> 14:38.043
all I figured you'd have a lot easier time
running it through your neighborhood bank

14:38.127 --> 14:40.921
than I would with mine. But damn, boy,

14:41.005 --> 14:45.593
if you ain't gettin' handsomer
and handsomer every year.

14:45.676 --> 14:47.136
And they got nerve enough to tell me

14:47.219 --> 14:48.888
that you always did favor your mama
in that regard.

14:49.263 --> 14:54.894
(laughing) Look, I gotta go,
but now, come punch-out time,

14:55.311 --> 14:59.189
I want you to call me at the Kenmore Hotel

14:59.440 --> 15:03.819
and let your old man treat you
to some Christmas dinner.

15:03.903 --> 15:06.530
-Uh, I don't know. (stammers) I mean, I--
-Now, Bobby. Bob.

15:06.822 --> 15:11.285
Don't give me no ifs,
ands, buts or whatsoevers.

15:11.368 --> 15:13.579
You call me, boy. Call me!

15:14.330 --> 15:18.167
And, Bobby, don't go spending
all of that in one place.

15:18.250 --> 15:21.712
(laughing)

15:29.595 --> 15:30.763
What do you mean,
you're not gonna call him?

15:30.846 --> 15:33.015
It's Christmas Eve, and he's your old man.

15:33.098 --> 15:34.850
I told you, Renko, he's nothin'.

15:35.434 --> 15:38.896
He never acted like my father.
He's not family. He's nothin'.

15:39.146 --> 15:43.233
I don't understand this mentality.
Just how old were you when he left?

15:44.526 --> 15:45.986
About six, I guess.

15:46.987 --> 15:48.530
Four kids, a wife.

15:49.406 --> 15:52.326
And he never so much as sent us a postcard
till six months later.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.787
Every year it's the same damn thing.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.081
Whenever he needs
a little traveling money,

15:57.164 --> 16:00.084
or whenever the cards
or the horses bring him back to town.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.964
I never had the nerve to tell him
what I thought of him.

16:06.799 --> 16:08.342
-Damn, why doesn't he just leave me alone?
-Hey, man, don't do that.

16:08.425 --> 16:11.178
-That's a gift. That's $500.
-It's bogus, Renko.

16:11.720 --> 16:15.391
The man never wrote a good check
in 20 years. So let's just eat.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.271
I'll kick myself till the day I die

16:21.355 --> 16:24.191
for not making things right
with my daddy before he passed on.

16:24.900 --> 16:27.069
Well, I don't have anything
to work out, Renko,

16:27.152 --> 16:28.696
so let's just drop it, all right?

16:29.738 --> 16:31.240
Take my advice, Bobby Hill.

16:31.865 --> 16:34.576
You get straight with that man.
You've got to get straight.

16:35.327 --> 16:38.789
-He's the only daddy you got.
-(laughs)

16:41.959 --> 16:44.294
Look, look.
We go down to Wisniewski's Poultry

16:44.378 --> 16:46.338
and we buy a nice, fresh turkey, okay?

16:46.422 --> 16:49.800
You can't go wrong with a fresh bird,
Neal. It's a real gesture.

16:51.135 --> 16:54.096
Do you remember that stew I used to date
that got pregnant on me?

16:54.179 --> 16:58.100
Roxanne, huh? Remember her?
Was she steamed up with me, huh?

16:58.851 --> 17:00.436
Okay, so it's Thanksgiving, right?

17:00.519 --> 17:04.231
I show up at her apartment
with a fresh turkey. Another guy's there.

17:04.440 --> 17:08.527
She kicks his butt out, we cook the bird.
What a night.

17:09.028 --> 17:12.031
Damn it, J.D.,
I didn't make this woman pregnant.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.784
-I killed her husband.
-It was an accident, man.

17:15.868 --> 17:17.453
Give yourself a break.

17:17.745 --> 17:19.329
You know, you're beating yourself up
over something

17:19.413 --> 17:21.749
I bet she doesn't even
hold you responsible for.

17:22.583 --> 17:24.835
(sighs) Yeah, maybe you're right.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.921
Sure I am. Come on. Huh? Come on.

17:28.005 --> 17:30.674
We'll go down, we'll pick up a bird
and we'll be down there.

17:30.966 --> 17:34.094
The gift of food breaks down
a lot of emotional barriers.

17:39.141 --> 17:42.853
Ah. Creamed sewage on rye.
Good choice, Belker.

17:42.936 --> 17:45.064
(growls)

17:47.399 --> 17:49.443
Hey. What's the latest on those crazies,
Henry?

17:49.526 --> 17:52.362
Uh, three assaults on the Hill,
two in Jefferson Heights.

17:52.446 --> 17:54.073
Guy's going for some kind of record.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.075
-Howard.
-Uh, Henry.

17:57.159 --> 18:02.915
Drugs, no doubt.
Speed, animal tranquilizers, juice.

18:03.082 --> 18:03.999
Doll, can I have a menu?

18:05.834 --> 18:07.711
So, tell me, Henry.

18:08.712 --> 18:11.173
What do Jews do at Christmas, anyway?

18:11.507 --> 18:13.509
I don't know, Howard. Go to Miami?

18:14.343 --> 18:15.928
-(chuckles)
-Thank you.

18:17.054 --> 18:19.932
I've been invited to dinner
at the Wolfowitz's home.

18:20.015 --> 18:24.895
Uh, I was wondering
if there's some sort of a ritual gift?

18:24.978 --> 18:28.982
Uh, sweet wine,
or perhaps a fruitcake or...

18:31.318 --> 18:33.070
I'm-I'm trying to convince them

18:33.153 --> 18:35.697
that I'm the appropriate suitor
for their daughter's hand.

18:37.491 --> 18:41.411
-Howard. Intending--
-To take a Jewess for my wife.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.207
-Right.
-What's wrong with that?

18:45.499 --> 18:47.709
Nothing. Nothing at all.

18:48.669 --> 18:52.005
Do the parents know you're...
of the Christian faith?

18:52.965 --> 18:55.551
Well, I intend to fly my colors,
if that's what you mean.

18:57.678 --> 18:58.512
Thank you.

19:00.931 --> 19:05.686
My good woman, do you have the temerity
to call this paste gravy?

19:05.769 --> 19:10.524
Why, you rotten Nazi slime.

19:10.774 --> 19:16.029
Well, that's a typical female's inability
to accept corrective input, Henry.

19:16.113 --> 19:17.614
It's the day before Christmas,

19:17.698 --> 19:20.742
my husband has deserted me
for a 19-year-old tootsie,

19:20.826 --> 19:23.662
my kids never call me,
I'm having hot flashes

19:23.745 --> 19:26.331
-and I made that gravy.
-Oh. Uh...

19:29.168 --> 19:34.256
Oh! Well, I might have been premature
in my judgment, madam. It's first rate.

19:34.631 --> 19:36.675
-WOMAN: I can't stand it anymore!
-My compliments to the chef.

19:36.758 --> 19:40.554
-I just can't take it. I wish I was dead.
-It's gonna be okay, hon.

19:40.929 --> 19:43.307
-Nice goin', crud brain.
-(woman sobbing)

19:45.350 --> 19:47.936
Sorry, guys. No Reggie Hill here.

19:48.854 --> 19:52.983
-Um, how about Reggie Hilbert?
-Nah.

19:53.066 --> 19:54.776
-Hilbert Reginald.
-Mmm.

19:56.069 --> 19:57.696
-Regis Reginald.
-HARV: Uh.

19:58.030 --> 20:00.490
-Regis Hillstone.
-Hillstone?

20:01.200 --> 20:04.995
-You lookin' for that bum too?
-Yeah, well... Well, sort of.

20:05.078 --> 20:07.080
Well, if you find him,
I want a piece of him.

20:07.289 --> 20:09.750
Guy waltzed out of his bill
not more than an hour ago.

20:09.833 --> 20:13.086
Even beat me out of the velour towels.
What do you got on him?

20:13.962 --> 20:16.048
Bunko? Yeah, bunko, I bet.

20:16.131 --> 20:18.133
-(stammers) Look, mister, um...
-HARV: Harv.

20:18.467 --> 20:20.761
Harv, this is probably our fault.

20:20.844 --> 20:23.347
You see, he probably thought
we were hot on his tail,

20:23.430 --> 20:25.557
and so he-he cut out on it.

20:25.641 --> 20:28.602
-Will 25 cover it?
-Includin' the towels?

20:29.353 --> 20:30.687
Towels. Yeah.

20:31.980 --> 20:34.024
Sorry for the inconvenience.
Merry Christmas.

20:34.316 --> 20:38.695
Yeah, have a good one yourself. (chuckles)
You like that, Martin? Cops!

20:38.779 --> 20:40.072
I don't believe this.
I don't believe this.

20:40.155 --> 20:43.033
First he does a number on me,
then he says he'll be at the hotel,

20:43.116 --> 20:45.494
then he leaves me with the damn bill
and goes out the back door.

20:45.577 --> 20:49.748
You got to admire the criminal mastermind,
Bobby. So are we gonna go get him?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.375
-No!
-What are you talkin' about?

20:51.458 --> 20:53.627
You gonna let it drop just like this,
him disappearing?

20:53.710 --> 20:54.628
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Four possible suspects, male.</i>

20:54.711 --> 20:55.712
Are you gonna let it drop?

20:55.796 --> 20:58.590
WOMAN:<i> Green Grand Prix,</i>
<i>last seen headed northbound.</i>

20:58.674 --> 21:00.384
BOBBY: 2202 responding. Over.

21:00.467 --> 21:02.511
-WOMAN:<i> Roger, 2202. We copy.</i>
-Come on, Renko.

21:03.220 --> 21:05.472
-(engine starts)
-(siren blaring)

21:05.847 --> 21:09.726
Merry Christmas. Ho, ho--

21:22.823 --> 21:24.324
Come on, lady. You wanna move?

21:31.415 --> 21:33.417
Yo, brother! Santa's a cop.

21:36.169 --> 21:40.048
(whistling "Jingle Bells")

21:40.132 --> 21:43.427
(growling)

21:43.760 --> 21:44.928
Move!

21:47.014 --> 21:48.724
What's with you? I got free speech.

21:48.807 --> 21:53.061
You little hair bag.
You are coming with me.

21:55.480 --> 21:57.024
I can hold as long as you can.

21:57.107 --> 21:58.942
-(indistinct dialog)
-I'll bet. Bye.

22:00.861 --> 22:02.154
Who do we have responding, Henry?

22:02.237 --> 22:04.906
Hill, Renko, Simmons, Obradovitch,
Morley, Gemigniani,

22:04.990 --> 22:08.118
-plus all Eastside Park on the perimeter.
-Frank, I think they changed cars.

22:08.201 --> 22:12.039
Now we got a report they are driving
a late-model black Oldsmobile, no plate.

22:12.122 --> 22:14.750
-What's the count?
-Seven incidents, three shootings.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.170
Thank you. The lady in the 133rd Street
robbery just died.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.796
-(sighs)
-Soon as we get ballistics,

22:19.880 --> 22:21.965
distribute citywide.
And keep an open line to Mercy.

22:22.049 --> 22:22.883
All right.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.385
How are we coming on the photos, Phil?

22:25.635 --> 22:29.056
Well, some of the victims are in troubled
straits, but they're trying.

22:29.765 --> 22:32.059
I sent Mueller over to Mercy
with some more mug books.

22:32.142 --> 22:32.976
Good.

22:33.518 --> 22:35.145
-MICK: Sarge?
-Yes?

22:36.563 --> 22:39.358
You wanna take care of this
sawed-off little delinquent?

22:39.441 --> 22:42.069
He was obstructing
an ongoing police operation.

22:42.611 --> 22:44.821
-Well.
-Who you calling a delinquent?

22:45.072 --> 22:49.534
-You jarhead. You jarhead in a red suit.
-(chuckles)

22:49.618 --> 22:51.703
Here's the grandmother's address, Sarge.

22:52.162 --> 22:54.456
Ooh. Say, Pepe--

22:54.539 --> 22:57.292
Will you escort young Herman
to the "B" level "incarcetorium"

22:57.376 --> 22:59.753
while I see if I can locate
the legal guardian?

23:03.673 --> 23:05.759
Lieutenant? I got a photo I.D.

23:06.510 --> 23:08.678
On a kid that I think is still in County.

23:08.762 --> 23:11.848
Now Joe and I picked this kid
up about two weeks ago on a "burg."

23:12.140 --> 23:14.351
He pulled 60 days,
so he's still in County, right?

23:14.643 --> 23:16.978
The week before Christmas? They all walk.

23:17.646 --> 23:20.107
LaRue, Washington.
Get going. You too, Bates.

23:20.190 --> 23:22.484
-Where?
-Uh, the kid's address is in the Heights.

23:22.567 --> 23:24.611
Right. Good. Get backups from over there.

23:24.986 --> 23:26.822
Hey, Flynn, keep going
with the books here.

23:26.905 --> 23:31.326
Henry, let's run this Rivera through
Corrections, Gang Intervention, BCI--

23:31.410 --> 23:32.911
-Howard--
-I got it, Ray.

23:32.994 --> 23:34.955
Webster, Ballantine, Saltoun.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.293
-J.D.: Police!
-CARMEN: Get out of here!

23:40.877 --> 23:44.172
You got no business in here, man.
Hey, what are you doing in there?

23:44.256 --> 23:46.883
Here. It's for you. It's a warrant.
All right, where is he?

23:46.967 --> 23:49.678
-Who?
-You know who. Luis.

23:50.095 --> 23:53.598
I don't know no Luis, man.
Hey! You leave that stuff alone.

23:53.682 --> 23:56.643
-Bedroom's clean.
-So you don't know Luis, huh?

23:56.726 --> 23:59.771
Whose is this gonna be then, huh?
You're under arrest, sugar.

23:59.855 --> 24:00.897
-This is a bust.
-WOMAN: I don't live here.

24:00.981 --> 24:03.275
(stammers) This is my cousin Tina's place.

24:03.358 --> 24:05.277
Hey, looks like a little blow too, Babe.

24:05.610 --> 24:08.738
Hey, you're flakin' me, pigs.
You lousy pigs!

24:09.322 --> 24:10.949
-Come on.
-This is my cousin Tina's place.

24:11.032 --> 24:13.243
I told you. Get out of here!

24:14.744 --> 24:15.996
This is my cousin--

24:18.290 --> 24:21.710
-Hey, hey. You know the lady died.
-You saying I killed some old woman?

24:21.793 --> 24:23.462
It's called being an accessory, kid.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.590
It's called harboring a fugitive,
obstruction of justice.

24:26.673 --> 24:28.341
You're 18 now, sugar. Gloves come off.

24:28.425 --> 24:31.428
-You gotta set my bail, man.
-You're not getting bail, Carmen.

24:31.511 --> 24:33.722
It's Christmas. You gotta give me bail.

24:33.805 --> 24:36.266
Hey, hey, Carmenita,
you ever been lost in the system?

24:36.349 --> 24:38.226
You know, we put you on a bus
with the wrong paperwork.

24:38.310 --> 24:41.229
Maybe takes you three, four days
just to get to Michigan Avenue.

24:41.313 --> 24:45.192
-(speaking in Spanish)
-What do I know what he does, huh?

24:45.275 --> 24:46.943
-You know!
-I don't know.

24:50.405 --> 24:52.199
A guy named Miguel from County.

24:52.616 --> 24:55.202
-Dudes he met inside.
-More names, Carmen.<i> Más nombres.</i>

24:55.285 --> 24:56.745
Miguel Alonzo.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.500
That's all.

25:03.126 --> 25:04.085
Release her.

25:06.379 --> 25:07.589
Come on. Come on!

25:10.634 --> 25:15.055
Henry, have Maris and William follow her,
and run the names through Corrections.

25:16.973 --> 25:19.142
GRANDMA:
You see, he's my daughter Cynthia's,

25:19.309 --> 25:20.685
and she lives in Roanoke.

25:21.102 --> 25:25.232
She went to Florida for a few days
with her boyfriend for the holidays.

25:25.315 --> 25:28.068
-(clamoring)
-So they sent up Herman. Herman!

25:29.069 --> 25:31.404
Get in here. Get-get back here.

25:32.572 --> 25:34.950
They sent Herman up to me and his papa.

25:35.450 --> 25:37.160
And only his papa's working all the time,

25:37.244 --> 25:39.579
and in the meantime he's just going
from bad to worse.

25:39.871 --> 25:42.207
Ma'am, I can appreciate
the difficulty, but--

25:42.290 --> 25:43.124
GRANDMA: But nothin'.

25:43.500 --> 25:46.211
Either he goes to the belt room
and gets a whuppin',

25:46.294 --> 25:47.587
or I don't take him home.

25:48.088 --> 25:50.423
Ooh. "The belt room."

25:50.507 --> 25:53.051
GRANDMA: Yes, and I took my eldest there
when he was cuttin' up,

25:53.134 --> 25:54.594
and he's a motorman now.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.806
And I brought Charles here.
Well, he got a whuppin' every other week.

25:57.889 --> 26:00.892
But he's a minister,
and that was 22 years ago.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.271
Well, you see, the belt room is occupied
at the moment.

26:04.354 --> 26:08.525
We have a particular incorrigible
who's being administered, uh...

26:09.651 --> 26:11.820
seventy strokes.

26:12.237 --> 26:17.367
I figure a young fella your age,
40, 45 should suffice.

26:17.701 --> 26:21.162
You know, you better hope you get a pillow
for Christmas, young fella.

26:21.413 --> 26:22.539
What's the trouble here, Sergeant?

26:22.998 --> 26:27.335
Well, I'm gonna take this young
incorrigible down to the belt room

26:27.419 --> 26:30.297
and see if I can effect a little change
in attitude.

26:30.380 --> 26:34.301
Oh, well, w-wait a minute
You had the last one, didn't you?

26:34.384 --> 26:36.511
-That's right, I did, sir.
-Well, I...

26:37.679 --> 26:40.348
-I think I'll have a crack at this one.
-Yes, sir.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.779
-Sit down.
-You gonna whip me?

26:56.239 --> 26:57.490
Nah, we don't do that here.

26:59.034 --> 27:01.328
Bull. I know what goes on in these places.

27:01.411 --> 27:03.747
Uh, what I actually wanted
to talk to you about was, uh,

27:03.830 --> 27:05.832
h-how long you think you're gonna be here.

27:06.625 --> 27:07.667
What do you want to know that for?

27:08.043 --> 27:09.961
Till a few days after Christmas,
you think?

27:10.629 --> 27:12.297
-Something like that.
-You in school?

27:13.006 --> 27:13.923
Yeah, I go.

27:16.426 --> 27:18.553
I heard your grandma out there. Uh...

27:19.971 --> 27:23.725
I have a sneaking suspicion
maybe you're mad at some people.

27:24.976 --> 27:26.311
Some people you think
maybe don't love you.

27:27.354 --> 27:29.856
-Like who?
-Your mother, maybe?

27:31.483 --> 27:33.443
Why did she have to go to Florida
with that dude?

27:33.526 --> 27:37.072
Maybe she's tired.
Needs a vacation. I don't know.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.992
Uh... I have a little boy too.

27:42.786 --> 27:45.413
He's not gonna be spending Christmas
with his mother either.

27:45.705 --> 27:48.750
-Why? Does she hate him?
-No, she doesn't hate him. She loves him.

27:49.376 --> 27:52.796
It's just that, sometimes, when a mother
and a father aren't living together,

27:54.673 --> 27:56.549
i-it's hard for them to...

27:57.467 --> 28:00.679
uh, explain things right to their kids.
You know?

28:04.683 --> 28:06.893
Like, uh, to say they love you...

28:08.311 --> 28:09.813
when they're not with you all the time.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.399
That's all I wanted to tell you.

28:12.982 --> 28:16.361
-Come on.
-No, really. That's all.

28:18.363 --> 28:20.573
That other dude. He's gonna whip me?

28:20.657 --> 28:22.283
I told you, we don't do that here.

28:25.203 --> 28:26.538
You wanna shake hands instead?

28:27.455 --> 28:29.708
-If I do, do I gotta be good?
-No.

28:31.960 --> 28:34.212
You just have to remember
how many people love you.

28:37.966 --> 28:39.175
(bell dings)

28:43.513 --> 28:44.514
Merry Christmas.

28:49.394 --> 28:50.645
What are you doing here?

28:50.729 --> 28:54.566
Mrs. Moldonado, I know it's not anything,
but it's the holidays and I thought...

28:56.359 --> 28:57.485
I bought you a gift.

28:57.944 --> 28:59.696
This how you pay off your guilt, huh?

29:00.613 --> 29:03.241
<i>Disgrazia</i>, you killed my husband.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.537
I know I did, ma'am.
But it was an accident.

29:08.621 --> 29:09.664
MRS. MOLDONADO: That's what you say.

29:09.748 --> 29:14.335
Police investigation. Big deal.
You all stick together.

29:14.669 --> 29:16.588
Ma'am, if I could bring him back,
I'd do anything.

29:16.671 --> 29:20.133
Listen, why don't you do yourself
a big favor and just get out of here, huh?

29:20.425 --> 29:22.844
Because if you're asking me
to forgive you, forget about it

29:22.927 --> 29:24.554
because I'll never forgive you.

29:25.263 --> 29:26.473
I wish it were that simple.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.435
I wish you could say something.
Then maybe I could sleep at night.

29:30.685 --> 29:33.646
Truth is, I know I did the right thing.

29:35.148 --> 29:37.776
But that doesn't change the fact
that your husband is dead

29:38.234 --> 29:39.110
and I killed him.

29:41.780 --> 29:43.323
I don't know what I'm doing here.

29:44.115 --> 29:46.284
I guess I just wanted
to make some sort of contact with you

29:46.367 --> 29:48.119
to tell you I feel for your loss.

29:50.371 --> 29:51.998
You know what I'm doing tonight?

29:54.042 --> 29:55.627
I'm going to stay open until midnight

29:55.710 --> 29:58.338
because people buy a lot of booze
on Christmas Eve.

29:59.172 --> 30:00.632
And then I'm going home alone.

30:01.257 --> 30:04.177
And drink and cry on the couch
until I pass out,

30:04.260 --> 30:08.139
because it's Christmas
and I don't have my husband.

30:10.892 --> 30:11.851
I'm sorry, ma'am.

30:13.561 --> 30:14.395
I really am.

30:16.856 --> 30:21.319
You are so sorry, huh?
I'll give you something to be sorry about.

30:21.528 --> 30:25.156
Because I am going to sue you
and your entire department's butt off

30:25.240 --> 30:27.450
for $3.2 million.

30:29.369 --> 30:30.286
Tellin', you, Neal, it's--

30:30.370 --> 30:32.080
Okay, men, let's be careful
with these costumes.

30:32.163 --> 30:34.707
I've got to return them to Kowalski's
just the way they gave them to me.

30:34.791 --> 30:36.709
Let's go, let's go.
We're getting a little late here.

30:36.793 --> 30:39.671
Neal, I'm telling you, it's stupid.
You took a shot. So what?

30:39.754 --> 30:40.964
Hey, just leave me alone, John.

30:41.047 --> 30:43.174
-You want me to go get the turkey back?
-It wasn't a turkey.

30:43.258 --> 30:45.385
-It was a damn goose.
-All right, whatever, man.

30:45.468 --> 30:48.054
I'll march right in and grab the sucker.
The hell with it.

30:48.763 --> 30:50.223
You know, I'll tell you something.
What you got here,

30:50.306 --> 30:53.434
what you got is your classic
holiday depression syndrome.

30:53.518 --> 30:54.602
It's strictly seasonal.

30:55.770 --> 30:58.022
You can populate Toledo
with the number of dudes

30:58.106 --> 31:00.733
that have blown themselves away
over eggnog and mistletoe.

31:01.109 --> 31:03.194
Yeah, that's just what I need right now.

31:03.486 --> 31:07.365
Some third-rate psychological commentary
on the holiday blues.

31:07.657 --> 31:09.534
Man, you don't have clue one
to what's eatin' me,

31:09.617 --> 31:12.996
so, why don't you just do me a favor
and button it up for a couple of weeks?

31:13.079 --> 31:16.624
Hey, come on.
Hey, now, you just hold on a second, pal.

31:16.708 --> 31:18.626
-Come on, guys. It's Christmas Eve.
-Go suck on a wreath, Coffey.

31:18.710 --> 31:20.962
Now I've been eating a lot of negative
flak off you all day,

31:21.045 --> 31:24.007
-and it's gotten to wear kind of thin.
-You know where the exit is.

31:24.299 --> 31:26.175
Damn it, Hurley, will you turn that
off for a minute, man?

31:26.259 --> 31:28.011
It's my fault the store owner
got blown away, huh?

31:28.094 --> 31:30.263
It's my fault his old lady
told you to stuff the goose

31:30.346 --> 31:33.474
-or turkey or whatever the hell it is.
-Man, you better check the scoreboard

31:33.558 --> 31:35.435
before you start gettin'
too righteous with me,

31:35.518 --> 31:38.897
because I have covered your sorry butt
through more times than I can count

31:38.980 --> 31:42.734
through times when you weren't
even fit for a bench in a detox ward.

31:42.817 --> 31:46.070
And now the one time that I need
a little understanding, you can't even--

31:46.446 --> 31:48.823
Damn it, man, I asked you
to turn the damn thing off!

31:48.907 --> 31:49.741
-(clattering)
-Hey, what are you doing?

31:49.824 --> 31:51.659
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
All right. Hey, hey, hey.

31:51.743 --> 31:53.953
Tomorrow, tomorrow.
I'll get you one twice as big.

31:54.996 --> 31:57.624
(groans)

32:00.043 --> 32:02.795
(bells jingling)

32:02.879 --> 32:03.880
HENRY: Mind if I join you?

32:15.600 --> 32:17.435
How long has it been since the shooting?

32:21.648 --> 32:23.024
Three months this Friday.

32:26.986 --> 32:28.488
Have you talked to anybody about it?

32:31.240 --> 32:34.911
Furillo? Department psych?
Jill, LaRue, anybody?

32:39.082 --> 32:41.084
I didn't think there was
any need to, Henry.

32:43.169 --> 32:44.045
I mean...

32:46.297 --> 32:49.884
I thought with a little time I could...
get a handle on it, you know?

32:51.386 --> 32:52.303
Have you?

32:55.014 --> 32:58.518
It's coming back up on me, Henry.
I'm chokin' on it.

33:02.480 --> 33:04.273
This job's full of guys like you, Neal.

33:05.650 --> 33:08.111
Want the world to think
they got it all under control.

33:08.987 --> 33:11.155
Everything's cool. No problem, no sweat.

33:11.447 --> 33:14.701
Strong and silent.
Ain't that just part of the profile, huh?

33:14.784 --> 33:15.952
Like hell it is.

33:17.370 --> 33:19.414
You know what happens
to guys like that, Neal?

33:19.706 --> 33:22.250
Guys like you who want to keep
it all inside themselves?

33:22.792 --> 33:24.752
Sometimes it takes a while. Years, maybe.

33:25.294 --> 33:28.715
But sooner or later, they lose everything
that ever meant anything to them.

33:29.048 --> 33:31.676
Their friends, families, the job.

33:32.301 --> 33:33.845
Maybe they just end up alone
in the middle of the night,

33:33.928 --> 33:36.180
staring down the barrel
of their service .38.

33:37.765 --> 33:40.184
(stammers) I want to talk it out, Henry.

33:43.312 --> 33:44.564
I want to deal with it.

33:46.733 --> 33:49.944
-But I just don't know how, man.
-HENRY: All right.

33:51.029 --> 33:56.075
There is a counselor name of Brennan,
out of Midtown.

33:58.786 --> 34:01.122
He's helped a lot of guys
through this sort of thing.

34:06.836 --> 34:07.795
Go see him, will ya?

34:17.889 --> 34:20.099
You got a lot of friends
in this department, Neal.

34:22.268 --> 34:24.103
Try to lean on us now and then, will you?

34:31.694 --> 34:33.946
St. Valentine's Day Massacre,

34:34.030 --> 34:38.451
Yom Kippur War, Christmas Eve,
rampage on the Hill.

34:38.743 --> 34:41.579
What's it all about, Bobby.
The holiday motif?

34:41.829 --> 34:44.832
Hill, Renko.
Your reindeer suits are waiting.

34:45.416 --> 34:46.292
(laughs)

34:53.883 --> 34:55.176
Well, I checked out of the hotel.

34:55.259 --> 34:58.179
-Wanted to see when you was gettin' off.
-You didn't check out.

34:58.262 --> 35:02.058
-You beat 'em for 25 bucks. I paid it.
-(laughs) Oh, come on, Bobby.

35:02.141 --> 35:04.852
I'd have sent 'em a check in the mail.
I do it all the time, boy.

35:04.936 --> 35:07.563
Now, come on, Bobby.
Have dinner with me tonight.

35:07.980 --> 35:10.274
Forget about it.
There's nothin' here, Reggie.

35:10.608 --> 35:13.361
Now, wait a minute, boy.
Don't you dare call me Reggie.

35:13.444 --> 35:14.821
Good, bad or indifferent,
I'm still your father,

35:14.904 --> 35:17.156
-and don't you ever forget it.
-Oh, no, you're not.

35:17.240 --> 35:18.282
You never were.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.327
I'm sick and tired of you
blowing into my life,

35:21.410 --> 35:22.411
churning up old wounds

35:22.495 --> 35:24.997
and then getting back on the bus,
leaving all over again.

35:25.623 --> 35:27.708
I just want you to leave me alone.

35:32.296 --> 35:36.551
All right, Bobby. I'll be going.

35:38.427 --> 35:40.304
But listen, Bobby, I...

35:42.723 --> 35:47.311
I could use a little... getting-away cash,
if you can spare it.

35:54.152 --> 35:55.736
Bobby, I want you to understand
something, son.

35:55.820 --> 35:58.781
I didn't come here just to hurt you, boy.

35:59.490 --> 36:01.242
And I didn't come here just for the money.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.494
Bobby, you gotta understand, son,
I'm just a...

37:13.105 --> 37:16.525
'Twas the night before Christmas
and all through the hospital,

37:16.901 --> 37:19.278
not a creature was stirring,
not even a marsupial.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.448
The tree was all trimmed,
and outside it was snowing,

37:22.907 --> 37:26.160
but the children were troubled
because Santa's not showing.

37:26.410 --> 37:29.997
Uh, but wait.
Here's his wife and two of his fairies.

37:30.081 --> 37:33.668
I'll ask them where's Santa,
and why is he tarry.

37:33.751 --> 37:36.045
-(applauding)
-I'm his old lady, so I ought to know,

37:36.128 --> 37:38.464
he left the North Pole over two days ago.

37:38.547 --> 37:40.591
His sled was all gassed
and in tip-top condition.

37:40.675 --> 37:42.677
I gave it a lube and rewired the ignition.

37:42.760 --> 37:45.596
Hey, I'm his personal elf.
I'm worried sick.

37:45.680 --> 37:47.473
He's never this late.
It's not like Saint Nick.

37:47.556 --> 37:50.768

38:36.647 --> 38:38.524
Hey, did you see the size
of those kids' eyes

38:38.607 --> 38:40.401
-when we yanked back that curtain?
-(chuckles)

38:40.484 --> 38:43.738
They were like saucers.
Oh, Mick, you were terrific.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.324
-Yes. Thank you.
-Man, am I pumped up.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.701
We gotta do these charity gigs more often.

38:48.784 --> 38:49.785
I know what you mean, man.

38:49.869 --> 38:53.039
I got another benefit I gotta do
in just a couple of hours.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.125
-Yeah? What's her name, J.D.?
-Loretta. Sicilian babe.

38:56.417 --> 38:59.712

39:01.839 --> 39:02.715

39:02.798 --> 39:05.801
Well, a bunch of us guys
are going over the Kubiaks'.

39:05.885 --> 39:07.553
Jakilek's gonna throw a Christmas bash.

39:07.636 --> 39:10.181
Be nice to get these antlers
kind of worn down.

39:10.264 --> 39:13.476
-Oh, are you gonna come, Mick?
-No, I can't. I got a date.

39:13.768 --> 39:15.686
Hey, we all have dates. Bring her along.

39:16.145 --> 39:18.564
Thanks anyway,
but I got a big dinner lined up,

39:18.647 --> 39:22.276

Let's follow procedures here,

41:51.634 --> 41:54.053
Ray, I want all the victims sequestered
until we can arrange a lineup.

41:54.136 --> 41:55.971
And I want that done
as soon as possible, Henry.

41:56.055 --> 41:59.308
I'm not about to blow this I.D.
on some logistical screwup.

41:59.391 --> 42:01.352
-Yes, sir.
-Ray, call the PD's office,

42:01.435 --> 42:03.521

42:03.812 --> 42:07.107
-J.D., Neal, get a jump on the paperwork.
-Captain, you promise me,

you promise me that
they're gonna pay for what they did.

42:08.943 --> 42:09.777
You promise me.

42:09.860 --> 42:12.363
We're doing everything we can, Mrs. Grady.

42:14.406 --> 42:15.407
Any word on Lucy?

42:16.075 --> 42:18.118
Coffey rode with her
in the ambulance to Mercy.

42:18.202 --> 42:19.787
She's in Intensive Care.

42:19.870 --> 42:21.455
-Keep me posted.
-Okay.

42:26.377 --> 42:27.211
Thanks.

42:35.844 --> 42:38.305
Uh, Neal, uh, about this afternoon.

42:38.389 --> 42:40.307
-Hey, forget it, babe.
-I don't wanna, man.

42:42.518 --> 42:44.728
I can be a real meathead sometimes,

42:46.355 --> 42:47.773
but your friendship, uh...

42:50.276 --> 42:52.027
It means more to me than anything.

42:56.782 --> 42:58.867
Uh... this is for you.

43:00.202 --> 43:01.120
What's this, man?

43:01.203 --> 43:03.998
J.D.: It's a Christmas present,
you melon. What's it look like?

43:06.875 --> 43:10.879
Uh, how about we exchange 'em tonight?
After dinner?

43:11.505 --> 43:14.717
This, uh, some kind
of half-assed dinner invitation?

43:14.800 --> 43:17.553
I'll call Jill and ask her to set
a couple extra plates, okay?

43:18.762 --> 43:19.722
You're on.

43:21.640 --> 43:23.767
Hey, I'll bring the goose.

43:25.436 --> 43:28.856

Don. Don, I won't know that
till we have a lineup.

43:33.611 --> 43:37.156
Yeah. Yes, of course. Right. Mm-hmm.

43:38.907 --> 43:42.202
-You're a life saver, counselor.
-Hot waxed and flat filed.

43:42.828 --> 43:46.123
You're going to be the fastest Italian
on snow since Gustavo Thöni.

43:46.206 --> 43:49.168
-Who's that?
-Forget it. You all set?

43:49.251 --> 43:51.420
No, just a couple of details,
and I'll be right with you.

43:51.503 --> 43:54.757
Frank, we've gotta go all the way across
town to pick up Frank Jr.,

43:55.007 --> 43:56.925
and believe me, if we miss this flight,

43:57.009 --> 43:58.927
we'll be stranded at that airport
till Easter.

43:59.011 --> 44:00.387
Excuse me, Francis.

44:02.097 --> 44:05.726
Well, Ms. Davenport,
don't we look ravishingly Alpine?

44:05.809 --> 44:07.019
-Mm, mmm.
-Thank you, Phil.

44:07.811 --> 44:11.398
Oh, Lucy Bates is out of Intensive Care.
It was only a mild concussion.

44:11.482 --> 44:13.275
They're gonna keep her overnight
for observation.

44:13.359 --> 44:14.401
Oh, that's great, Phil.

44:14.485 --> 44:17.112
Listen, let's send her some flowers
from everyone. I'll pay for them.

44:17.571 --> 44:19.948
-All right.
-Phil, send the bill to me.

44:23.827 --> 44:24.912
Yes, Ms. Davenport.

44:26.872 --> 44:28.123
Now what about this unfinished business?

44:28.207 --> 44:30.292
We ran a lineup
for the first two victims, Frank.

44:30.376 --> 44:33.962
-Uh, so far we're batting a clean 1,000.
-Good work, Henry.

44:35.381 --> 44:37.925
-We're out of here, counselor.
-Uh, Frank.

44:38.384 --> 44:42.179
Chief Daniels on line five.
I think it sounds urgent.

44:43.889 --> 44:46.600
Uh, tell him I've gone skiing, Ray.

44:47.685 --> 44:48.560
