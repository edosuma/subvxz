01:23.790 --> 01:26.380
Arrgggh!

01:26.380 --> 01:29.420
Oh, that feels better.

01:29.420 --> 01:33.040
Spring already and I still
haven't come up with a new line!

01:33.040 --> 01:36.250
Easter eggs, bunnies,
baseball allergies.

01:36.250 --> 01:38.290
Allergies?

01:38.290 --> 01:39.580
That's it!

01:39.580 --> 01:41.330
Hmmm!

01:41.330 --> 01:45.380
Memo to myself: I'll call it
the Pollen Pullover.

01:45.380 --> 01:46.670
Wait, I tried that.

01:46.670 --> 01:50.250
3,000 women were attacked
by love-crazed bees.

01:51.460 --> 01:56.250
Oh, it's no use,
I feel empty, dried up.

01:56.250 --> 01:59.880
I've got to get out of these
four walls and get fresh ideas!

01:59.880 --> 02:02.960
Ahem! Here are
my sketches,
Cruella.

02:02.960 --> 02:06.250
I wanted to drop
them off before
leaving town. Bye!

02:06.250 --> 02:08.540
Leaving town?
What are you talking about?

02:08.540 --> 02:09.790
My vacation.

02:09.790 --> 02:11.580
We've known about it
for a year.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.460
Vacation

02:15.580 --> 02:18.000
Hmm. Oh, here it is.

02:18.000 --> 02:22.750
Vacation. "Time taken off
from employment for recreation."

02:22.750 --> 02:27.040
Often followed immediately
by termination.

02:27.040 --> 02:29.290
Why didn't you say so, Anita?

02:29.290 --> 02:30.880
We can skip the vacation.

02:30.880 --> 02:32.500
I'll terminate you
right now.

02:32.500 --> 02:34.500
But I don't want
to lose my job.

02:34.500 --> 02:36.830
I want to spend time
with my family,

02:36.830 --> 02:38.830
to recharge
my batteries

02:38.830 --> 02:41.420
and come back
to work refreshed
with new ideas.

02:41.420 --> 02:44.830
New ideas?
What a wonderful notion!

02:44.830 --> 02:47.460
Of course you can have
a vacation.

02:48.750 --> 02:51.000
On one condition.

02:56.460 --> 02:57.880
Thanks, Lucky.

02:59.460 --> 03:02.750
Isn't this great?
Our first vacation.

03:02.750 --> 03:05.790
A chance for adventure
and exciting new places.

03:05.790 --> 03:08.580
I see it as
a spiritual
pilgrimage,

03:08.580 --> 03:10.460
traveling further
on my journey

03:10.460 --> 03:12.330
to a perfect
Zen-like state.

03:12.330 --> 03:13.380
Om!

03:13.380 --> 03:14.500
Thanks, Cadpig!

03:14.500 --> 03:15.750
Huh?

03:15.750 --> 03:17.790
I don't care
what state we're in.

03:17.790 --> 03:18.960
Roger: Rolly?!

03:18.960 --> 03:22.330
As long as I get to sample
the local food.

03:22.330 --> 03:24.670
Kibble con carne,
kibble and grits,

03:24.670 --> 03:26.790
kibble kraut!

03:26.790 --> 03:29.920
Sweet-and-sour kibble!

03:29.920 --> 03:34.710
Come on, guys, let's go
get some of our stuff
to take on vacation.

03:37.790 --> 03:42.460
Oh! This trip is gonna
be so romantic.

03:42.460 --> 03:44.420
I can't wait to see
her face.

03:44.420 --> 03:48.040
Anita hasn't figured out
the surprise, has she?

03:48.040 --> 03:50.120
No, she doesn't even
have a clue!

03:50.120 --> 03:52.000
She still thinks we're
going to go see

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
the Biddleburg Bivalves
in spring training.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.330
Now, don't say anything.

03:55.330 --> 03:58.290
I want to tell her
at just the right time.

03:58.290 --> 04:02.420
Aaah! That darn latch!
Ugggh!

04:02.420 --> 04:04.670
Anyway, it'll be fun.

04:04.670 --> 04:07.750
Just the two of us traveling
the highways and byways.

04:07.750 --> 04:08.830
Huh?

04:08.830 --> 04:11.080
Roger,
about the trip...

04:11.080 --> 04:15.830
Okay, okay, okay.
This trip is really
not about the Bivalves.

04:15.830 --> 04:19.380
It's not?
But you said it meant
so much to you.

04:19.380 --> 04:21.710
Well, not as much
as our anniversary.

04:21.710 --> 04:24.880
Two weeks from today,
we're going to end our trip

04:24.880 --> 04:26.790
at the church
where we were married.

04:26.790 --> 04:28.540
To renew our wedding vows.

04:28.540 --> 04:31.710
Anita Dearly, will you
marry me again?

04:31.710 --> 04:34.290
I will marry you again,
Roger Dearly.

04:34.290 --> 04:36.170
We'll drop the top,
see the sights,

04:36.170 --> 04:38.960
and stay at honeymoon suites
all across the country.

04:38.960 --> 04:40.460
Come on, let's get started.

04:40.460 --> 04:43.830
What a wonderful way
to celebrate
our anniversary.

04:46.710 --> 04:49.880
Sorry, guys, but
this trip is just
for the two of us.

04:50.960 --> 04:53.120
Right, Roger,
about that...

04:53.120 --> 04:54.790
I know what you're
gonna say.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.710
-And you're right.

04:56.710 --> 04:58.330
We should take Perdy
and Pongo.

04:58.330 --> 05:00.500
They did bring us together
and it's their honeymoon, too.

05:00.500 --> 05:02.880
Actually, I was going
to say --

05:02.880 --> 05:04.580
I know, I know...

05:04.580 --> 05:06.790
We'll need more room.

05:12.040 --> 05:14.170
Look, we're taking
the big car!

05:14.170 --> 05:17.710
I wondered how we were all
gonna fit in the convertible.

05:20.830 --> 05:23.380
Hey, you guys aren't going.

05:24.540 --> 05:26.500
Come on, guys, out.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.790
Roger, I really
have to talk to you.

05:28.790 --> 05:30.750
We need to make room
for someone else.

05:30.750 --> 05:32.040
It would be terrible

05:32.040 --> 05:34.040
to celebrate Pongo
and Perdy's marriage

05:34.040 --> 05:35.790
by breaking up
their family.

05:35.790 --> 05:38.120
But there's only room for Pongo
and Perdita's pups.

05:40.250 --> 05:41.960
Whoa! Hey!

05:45.790 --> 05:49.620
Actually, Roger,
while we're making
room for more...

05:52.620 --> 05:55.790
Oh, no, absolutely not!

06:02.750 --> 06:05.170
Well, I guess that's
everything.

06:05.170 --> 06:06.290
Actually...

06:06.290 --> 06:07.330
Huh?

06:10.170 --> 06:11.540
What?

06:11.540 --> 06:13.290
Surprise?

06:13.290 --> 06:16.170
Anita, Rudolph,
let's get going.

06:16.170 --> 06:17.210
Huh?

06:17.210 --> 06:18.540
No way!

06:18.540 --> 06:20.210
This is our second honeymoon.

06:20.210 --> 06:22.540
Why does it always
have to be about you?

06:22.540 --> 06:24.580
You've already had
one honeymoon.

06:24.580 --> 06:27.380
Anita and I need
a working vacation

06:27.380 --> 06:31.040
to find inspiration
in the great outdoors
for my new spring line.

06:31.040 --> 06:34.420
And we'll need someone
to drive, so you can
come along, too, Rupture.

06:34.420 --> 06:35.920
Now, Roger.

06:35.920 --> 06:37.250
Forget it!

06:37.250 --> 06:39.250
Roger, please,
I didn't have
any choice.

06:39.250 --> 06:41.250
It was this
or be fired.

06:41.250 --> 06:43.750
But this
is a romantic getaway!

06:43.750 --> 06:45.420
Well, how was
I supposed to know?

06:45.420 --> 06:48.620
You told me we were going
to see the Bicuspids.

06:48.620 --> 06:52.420
That's Bivalves!
I was trying
to surprise you.

06:52.420 --> 06:54.330
Well, surprise!

06:56.080 --> 06:58.380
Let's get going!

06:58.380 --> 07:02.500
Arrrggh!

07:02.500 --> 07:04.420
Well, at least
you packed light.

07:04.420 --> 07:06.960
I always do.

07:11.330 --> 07:14.000
Cruella: I'm only bringing
the west wing.

07:15.080 --> 07:17.080
Huh?

07:17.080 --> 07:19.500
Well, Nanny, you might
as well hop on, too.

07:19.500 --> 07:23.960
Oh, no! This second honeymoon
is crowded enough already.

07:23.960 --> 07:25.880
Uh, ta-ta!

07:25.880 --> 07:28.120
Climb in, Spot.
There's room for one more.

07:28.120 --> 07:29.460
Uh, no, thanks.

07:29.460 --> 07:33.380
Chickens have road issues,
like crossing them.

07:33.380 --> 07:34.670
Okay.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.460
Don't forget to write!

07:40.250 --> 07:43.460
It's going
to be so nice
without the pups.

07:43.460 --> 07:46.500
Think of all
the poultry fun
we can have together.

07:46.500 --> 07:48.790
Uh, what did you have
in mind, mom?

07:48.790 --> 07:51.670
Oh, we'll have
a marvelous time!

07:51.670 --> 07:52.880
Sitting on eggs

07:52.880 --> 07:55.620
and clucking
mindlessly about
sitting on eggs.

07:55.620 --> 07:57.420
And sitting on eggs
some more

07:57.420 --> 07:59.830
and sitting
on some eggs
and clucking...

07:59.830 --> 08:02.380
Aaaah! Wait for me!

08:02.380 --> 08:04.330
Aaaaaaah!

08:07.040 --> 08:09.420
Anita: Uh, Roger, I think
Wizzer needs to...

08:09.420 --> 08:11.210
Roger: I know, I know!

08:16.170 --> 08:17.670
Roger: Wizzer! Again?

08:21.250 --> 08:22.790
Anita: Uh, Roger.

08:22.790 --> 08:24.330
Roger: Okay, okay!

08:30.380 --> 08:33.920
Cruella: Not one more stop!
We're on a schedule.

08:35.290 --> 08:37.420
Stop this bus!

08:37.420 --> 08:40.580
Somebody get me
a change of shoes!

08:46.250 --> 08:48.920
Yes! Oh, that's it,
that's it!

08:48.920 --> 08:52.380
It just cries,
"Pull over,
I'm coming through!"

08:52.380 --> 08:54.120
I'll call it
"Road Sign Wear,

08:54.120 --> 08:56.580
for women
in the fast lane."

08:56.580 --> 08:58.960
I must put this into
production immediately!

09:06.250 --> 09:08.290
Cruella, not again!

09:08.290 --> 09:11.040
Oh, the copy's too light!

09:11.040 --> 09:12.500
Floor it, Ringworm!

09:12.500 --> 09:15.420
This is a bus, not a business.

09:15.420 --> 09:17.420
Some vacation!

09:17.420 --> 09:21.210
Roger, let's just try
to make the best of it.
At least we're together.

09:21.210 --> 09:24.120
And you'll still get
to see your baseball team.

09:24.120 --> 09:26.790
Yeah, and we'll get to renew
our wedding vows, too.

09:26.790 --> 09:29.620
Oh, Roger,
I can hardly wait.

09:29.620 --> 09:32.830
Enough! Anita,
time to create!

09:32.830 --> 09:34.250
Rugrat, drive!

09:35.500 --> 09:38.080
Thanks to Cruella,
we're taking the scenic route

09:38.080 --> 09:41.120
of Rolly's big butt.

09:41.120 --> 09:42.540
I'm not fat!

09:42.540 --> 09:45.290
Yeah, we haven't been
off this bus for hours.

09:46.580 --> 09:48.120
Shh!

09:48.120 --> 09:51.250
Don't mind Cruella.
What's our first stop?

09:51.250 --> 09:53.920
First, I thought we'd stop
at Lover's Caverns,

09:53.920 --> 09:56.000
then on to
Main Squeeze Falls --

09:56.000 --> 09:57.920
Cruella: Just a minute,
Rollbar.

09:57.920 --> 09:59.580
This is a working vacation,

09:59.580 --> 10:02.170
and your ideas just aren't
working for me.

10:02.170 --> 10:04.040
Here's my itinerary.

10:04.040 --> 10:06.250
Ahem! First, stop at
the birthplace of Dr. Lipo,

10:06.250 --> 10:08.290
the inventor of liposuction,
whom I worship.

10:08.290 --> 10:11.880
Then to the Ultimate Mall
of the Rich and Famous
to shop, shop, shop!

10:11.880 --> 10:15.250
Forget it.
Cruella, you may have
butted in on our trip,

10:15.250 --> 10:17.080
but this is still
a second honeymoon

10:17.080 --> 10:19.830
and we're going to do
the romantic things we want!

10:19.830 --> 10:23.080
Oh, Root Beer,
that is so sweet!

10:23.080 --> 10:24.120
No!

10:24.120 --> 10:25.210
Yes!

10:25.210 --> 10:26.710
No!

10:26.710 --> 10:28.040
Yes!

10:28.040 --> 10:29.420
No!

10:29.420 --> 10:31.250
-Roger: Yes!
-Cruella: No!

10:31.250 --> 10:33.290
-Roger: Yes!
-Cruella: No!

10:36.080 --> 10:37.460
Cruella: Yes!

11:18.210 --> 11:21.420
I'm gettin' nowhere fast.

11:21.420 --> 11:24.250
I'll never catch up
with that bus.

11:26.580 --> 11:28.120
Oh, goodie!

11:31.710 --> 11:33.120
How'd you get out?

11:33.120 --> 11:35.290
Huh? Yaaah!

11:40.790 --> 11:42.080
Welcome aboard!

11:42.080 --> 11:44.790
Boy, are you lucky we stopped.

11:44.790 --> 11:47.330
I'll say.
I'm in a hurry to get someplace.

11:47.330 --> 11:49.250
Where is this crate headed?

11:49.250 --> 11:50.750
To the happy place!

11:50.750 --> 11:53.460
all: Pluck Pluck Plucky Farms!

11:53.460 --> 11:55.540
Plucky Farms?
Where is that?

11:59.460 --> 12:03.960
What exactly do you
do at Plucky Farms
to make you so happy?

12:03.960 --> 12:07.670
Who knows? Chickens
are so happy there,
they never come back!

12:07.670 --> 12:09.000
That sounds fishy.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.080
No, that's
a different truck.

12:15.750 --> 12:18.960
Ah, I got a bad
feeling about this.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.170
Are you sure you
know what you're
talking about?

12:21.170 --> 12:23.750
We'll know soon enough.
We're almost there.

12:26.120 --> 12:27.830
Aaaaah!

12:36.880 --> 12:39.500
We haven't gotten to see
anything we wanna see.

12:39.500 --> 12:40.750
Right, Rolly?

12:40.750 --> 12:42.330
Rolly?

12:47.330 --> 12:49.710
I think the pups wanna stop.

12:49.710 --> 12:52.040
At a dog food factory?

12:52.040 --> 12:53.670
Over my dead body.

12:59.250 --> 13:00.460
Close enough.

13:08.330 --> 13:11.880
Rolly: Golly,
it's Klaus von Kibble,

13:11.880 --> 13:15.210
the inventor of the
meat-flavored filler byproduct.

13:15.210 --> 13:18.670
He came to this country in 1872

13:18.670 --> 13:21.420
with nothing but cornmeal
and a dream.

13:21.420 --> 13:25.040
Welcome to the tastiest place
on earth.

13:25.040 --> 13:27.080
Follow me, and I'll show you
how we make it.

13:27.080 --> 13:32.000
During the tour, please, refrain
from marking any territory.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.330
Ohhh!

13:34.330 --> 13:35.960
guide: As you can see,

13:35.960 --> 13:38.000
we only use
the freshest ingredients

13:38.000 --> 13:39.710
in Kanine Krunchies.

13:39.710 --> 13:41.420
Oh, I have a question!

13:41.420 --> 13:45.290
When you made batch
number 4586 last year,

13:45.290 --> 13:47.920
there was a slight
hint of curry

13:47.920 --> 13:49.580
in the special
pedigree mix.

13:49.580 --> 13:54.040
Were you secretly
experimenting with
a new flavor combo?

13:54.040 --> 13:56.080
That wasn't curry,
that was chromium.

13:56.080 --> 13:57.500
One of the workers

13:57.500 --> 13:59.210
dropped their wrist watch
in the shredder.

13:59.210 --> 14:03.120
Oh, I wondered why I belched up
that watch face.

14:03.120 --> 14:05.080
I thought it was a prize.

14:05.080 --> 14:08.120
guide: On our right
is the tasting room.

14:13.920 --> 14:16.040
What a job!

14:21.170 --> 14:23.040
98, 99...

14:23.040 --> 14:24.460
100.

14:24.460 --> 14:26.120
Somebody's missing.

14:26.120 --> 14:31.380
Rolly: No, no!
Sanctuary!

14:31.380 --> 14:34.080
Spot: This truck is
a link in the food chain.

14:34.080 --> 14:36.000
And you're the food!

14:36.000 --> 14:39.170
B-but you're saying our whole
belief system is a lie?

14:39.170 --> 14:41.290
Gee, how do I put this?

14:41.290 --> 14:42.710
Yes!

14:42.710 --> 14:46.960
I'm telling you, Plucky Farms
isn't a happy place,

14:46.960 --> 14:48.040
it's a slaughterhouse!

14:50.420 --> 14:53.210
I'm sure that's a typo.

14:53.210 --> 14:56.960
Take the "s" off and it says
"laughterhouse."

14:56.960 --> 14:58.920
Sounds happy to me.

14:58.920 --> 15:01.000
Doesn't it, guys?

15:06.040 --> 15:09.330
Stop! Don't panic!

15:09.330 --> 15:10.830
Make up your mind!

15:10.830 --> 15:13.750
Don't be happy,
don't panic?
Pick a mood!

15:13.750 --> 15:17.250
All we have to do
to free ourselves is stop
this truck of terror.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.960
How do we
do that?

15:18.960 --> 15:21.380
We disconnect the trailer
from the cab.

15:21.380 --> 15:23.920
Uh, any volunteers to climb
under the truck

15:23.920 --> 15:25.210
and disengage the hitch?

15:27.920 --> 15:32.000
Great!
Now, that's teamwork.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.790
Aaaaah!

15:37.460 --> 15:40.830
I could have been clucking
mindlessly with mom

15:40.830 --> 15:43.500
right about now, but no!

15:43.500 --> 15:48.330
I'm stuck in here with a bunch
of mindless chickens.

15:57.120 --> 15:59.250
I should have stayed in bed.

16:15.580 --> 16:20.040
You've done it, Spot!
We're going right past
Plucky Farms!

16:20.040 --> 16:22.830
And right into that restaurant!

16:29.620 --> 16:31.250
man: Welcome to Clucky's.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.710
Uh, yeah, one gizzards
in a gravy boat,

16:33.710 --> 16:37.330
a Plucky Plate combo meal,
and a Friar Cluck Club.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.960
That'll be $47.53.

16:39.960 --> 16:43.080
Please pull up
to the service desk.

16:57.330 --> 16:59.920
Thanks
for your order.

17:01.170 --> 17:03.790
Keep on cluckin'!

17:04.750 --> 17:08.330
(Spot screeching,
chickens squawking)

17:10.880 --> 17:12.710
Holy chimichanga!

17:12.710 --> 17:15.210
Move your drumsticks!

17:17.250 --> 17:19.250
How fresh is your chicken?

17:21.920 --> 17:24.210
Aw, jeez, now that's fresh.

17:24.210 --> 17:26.670
Spot: The Dearlys.
They were here.

17:28.040 --> 17:31.790
I wonder why they were here.
Only chicken eaters stop here.

17:31.790 --> 17:34.540
Oh, that is sick!

17:46.460 --> 17:48.920
Roger: Next stop,
Main Squeeze Falls,

17:48.920 --> 17:50.880
whether you like it or not.

17:50.880 --> 17:52.830
Cruella: A waterfall?!

17:52.830 --> 17:55.040
I can't stop there
without hairspray.

17:57.000 --> 17:59.380
Cruella: Jasper,
pull up alongside

17:59.380 --> 18:01.290
and pass me
the Cruella Sheen.

18:02.920 --> 18:05.750
Aaaah!

18:05.750 --> 18:07.580
Hang out farther!

18:09.670 --> 18:12.000
Uh, Cruella, the exit
is coming up.

18:16.920 --> 18:18.330
Huh?

18:23.620 --> 18:26.750
Oh, Roger,
it's beautiful.

18:26.750 --> 18:28.710
It is, isn't it?

18:28.710 --> 18:31.750
Even Cruella can't ruin
a moment like this.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.710
All this moisture is making
my nasal cavities

18:35.710 --> 18:37.580
back up with mucus.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.210
There's a turnoff.
Maybe it will take us
to the falls.

18:44.210 --> 18:46.580
Maybe it will take us
to an emergency room.

18:46.580 --> 18:50.120
Jasper: This must be the way.
We'll just follow that water.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.960
Big smiles, everybody.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.080
This is the last shot
on the roll.

18:57.080 --> 18:58.580
Hold it, Rhubarb!

18:58.580 --> 18:59.880
This lighting is too good

18:59.880 --> 19:02.380
to waste on someone
with no bone structure.

19:02.380 --> 19:04.420
Your last shot should be of me.

19:04.420 --> 19:06.830
I'm taking a picture
of my family!

19:06.830 --> 19:09.170
It's all right,
go ahead and shoot her.

19:09.170 --> 19:10.290
I'd love to.

19:10.290 --> 19:12.920
I meant with the camera.

19:12.920 --> 19:15.830
Some second honeymoon
this is turning out to be.

19:15.830 --> 19:19.790
Anita: Now, Roger,
remember our vows,
for better or worse.

19:19.790 --> 19:22.500
This is, you know, worse.

19:22.500 --> 19:24.750
Yeah... Vows?
The church.

19:24.750 --> 19:26.120
I forgot
to call ahead!

19:26.120 --> 19:27.750
I'll take care of that

19:27.750 --> 19:29.790
while you take
care of Cruella.

19:45.250 --> 19:46.670
Couldn't be.

19:47.960 --> 19:50.000
Oh, yeah, got it.
Let's go.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.380
That was not my best side.

19:52.380 --> 19:55.120
It's the one I like best:
doesn't have a mouth.

19:56.250 --> 19:58.710
Ugggh!

19:58.710 --> 20:01.540
You're not going
to process that!

20:01.540 --> 20:04.460
Those were
our vacation pictures!

20:04.460 --> 20:06.750
All right, that is it.
I have had it!

20:06.750 --> 20:10.500
Ever since you...
No more!

20:10.500 --> 20:13.250
Yaaaaaah!

20:14.830 --> 20:16.040
woman: Saint Walt's Chapel.

20:16.040 --> 20:17.580
This is Anita Dearly.

20:17.580 --> 20:20.710
My husband and I want to renew
our vows in 10 days.

20:20.710 --> 20:23.750
Say, will Reverend Skankerelli
be available?

20:23.750 --> 20:27.540
Oh, Skankerelli?
He isn't a minister.

20:27.540 --> 20:29.830
He's not?
What is he?

20:29.830 --> 20:31.540
Well, a con man mostly.

20:31.540 --> 20:33.790
He passes himself off
as all sorts of people.

20:33.790 --> 20:36.250
A plumber, an orthodontist,
a supermodel.

20:36.250 --> 20:38.250
But he performed our wedding.

20:38.250 --> 20:42.420
He said a bunch of words
and charged a lot of money,
but it wasn't a wedding.

20:42.420 --> 20:43.880
Sorry to tell you this, ma'am,

20:43.880 --> 20:45.580
but you're not married.

20:49.540 --> 20:52.620
Roger,
I have terrible news!

20:52.620 --> 20:54.170
Be, uh...
Be right with you, hon.

20:55.420 --> 20:56.670
You got three more stamps?

20:56.670 --> 20:58.250
Roger, what are you doing?

20:58.250 --> 21:00.500
I was gonna send her
first-class.

21:00.500 --> 21:01.620
So, what's the news?

21:01.620 --> 21:03.540
We're not legally married.

21:03.540 --> 21:06.790
I called the church.
The minister was a fake.

21:09.080 --> 21:10.670
Well, don't worry.

21:10.670 --> 21:12.040
All it means is,

21:12.040 --> 21:13.920
instead of renewing our vows,

21:13.920 --> 21:15.880
we'll get married for real.

21:15.880 --> 21:18.750
Cruella: Hmm!

21:18.750 --> 21:22.830
I don't like that look.
What's she up to?

21:22.830 --> 21:25.790
You know, this will be
even more romantic.

21:25.790 --> 21:27.830
How many couples get
to have two weddings?

21:32.830 --> 21:35.750
Hello, is this
the Grutely County Clerk?

21:35.750 --> 21:38.420
Yes, one small question:
what would happen

21:38.420 --> 21:40.710
if the deed to the Dearly farm
is made out

21:40.710 --> 21:44.420
to Mr. and Mrs. Dearly
when there isn't
a Mr. and Mrs. Dearly?

21:44.420 --> 21:46.290
It would be invalid?

21:46.290 --> 21:49.210
Oh, wonderful!
I mean, that's terrible!

21:49.210 --> 21:51.290
There's a grace period?

21:51.290 --> 21:54.670
If they get married within
ten days, the deed is valid?

21:54.670 --> 21:58.580
Oh, that's terrible.
I mean, wonderful.

21:58.580 --> 22:02.880
All I have to do is make
sure the Dearlys don't get
to the church on time,

22:02.880 --> 22:04.830
and their farm
is as good as mine.

22:04.830 --> 22:06.420
Memo to myself:

22:06.420 --> 22:09.420
Ha ha ha ha ha!
