WEBVTT

00:04.247 --> 00:07.364
Captain's Starlog, March 21, 2153.

00:07.647 --> 00:10.036
After three days exploring
an uninhabited planet...

00:10.167 --> 00:12.920
Commander Tucker and I have been
called back to Enterprise...

00:13.047 --> 00:14.765
to greet an unexpected visitor.

00:14.887 --> 00:16.923
Maybe you were light-headed
from the altitude.

00:17.047 --> 00:20.278
I didn't slip. That overhang gave way
the moment I put my foot on it.

00:20.407 --> 00:23.240
- I walked on the same rocks you did.
- Maybe you loosened them.

00:23.447 --> 00:26.120
You do weigh a few kilos
more than I do.

00:27.887 --> 00:29.036
Report.

00:29.647 --> 00:31.877
It dropped out of warp 30 minutes ago.

00:32.006 --> 00:34.077
The pilot sent a brief audio message.

00:34.207 --> 00:36.118
He insisted on speaking with you
right away.

00:36.247 --> 00:37.362
Any idea what he wants?

00:37.487 --> 00:38.636
He wouldn't say...

00:38.767 --> 00:42.476
but I did manage to find his ship design
in the Vulcan database.

00:42.967 --> 00:44.446
It's Tellarite.

00:44.687 --> 00:46.245
T'Pol's mentioned them.

00:48.287 --> 00:49.845
Open a channel.

00:52.327 --> 00:54.477
This is Jonathan Archer
of the Enterprise.

00:54.607 --> 00:55.722
What can I do for you?

00:55.847 --> 00:59.078
You can start by telling me
what you're doing here.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.119
I didn't get your name.

01:01.247 --> 01:04.876
Captain Skalaar
of the Tellarite Mining Consortium.

01:05.847 --> 01:07.883
We're studying this planet.

01:08.087 --> 01:10.362
I have three science teams
on the surface.

01:10.527 --> 01:12.677
We're also here for a little shore leave.

01:12.807 --> 01:14.160
"Shore leave"?

01:14.407 --> 01:15.635
Vacation.

01:15.847 --> 01:18.725
It's been a while
since we've had a chance to relax.

01:18.847 --> 01:23.045
In that case, I recommend you visit
the equatorial range.

01:23.247 --> 01:26.319
The view from the north summit
is inspiring.

01:26.847 --> 01:28.326
You've been here before?

01:28.447 --> 01:32.201
Many times. I prefer to think of it
as my own personal retreat.

01:32.327 --> 01:34.363
You mustn't leave
until you've experienced...

01:34.487 --> 01:37.843
the hydrothermal pools of Ren-gham.

01:39.087 --> 01:40.122
Where are they?

01:40.247 --> 01:41.805
The polar island chain...

01:41.927 --> 01:46.205
227 kilometres from the southern tip
of the Rykos shoreline.

01:46.327 --> 01:50.081
Look for the pyroclastic debris field,
then follow the lava tubes...

01:50.207 --> 01:52.004
Sounds like we could use a guide.

01:52.207 --> 01:54.163
I'd be happy to show you.

01:55.007 --> 01:56.520
Sure we're not intruding?

01:56.647 --> 02:00.435
Not at all. I'll meet you
at your starboard docking port.

02:00.607 --> 02:03.405
I'll help you plan your "shore leave."

02:05.727 --> 02:08.877
T'Pol says they're not
the most agreeable species.

02:09.487 --> 02:11.762
Apparently, they enjoy a good argument.

02:11.887 --> 02:14.959
It's considered a sport on their planet.

02:15.687 --> 02:19.202
I've got an old girlfriend
this guy might like to meet.

02:21.000 --> 02:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here

02:40.967 --> 02:43.527
It's been a long road

02:45.167 --> 02:47.806
Gettin' from there to here

02:48.247 --> 02:51.045
It's been a long time

02:51.847 --> 02:55.317
But my time is finally near

02:55.807 --> 02:59.197
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

03:00.047 --> 03:02.880
I will touch the sky

03:03.287 --> 03:06.916
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

03:07.047 --> 03:10.039
No, they're not gonna change my mind

03:10.167 --> 03:14.445
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

03:14.607 --> 03:17.679
I'm going where my heart will take me

03:17.807 --> 03:21.959
I've got faith to believe

03:22.087 --> 03:25.045
I can do anything

03:25.167 --> 03:28.876
I've got strength of the soul

03:29.487 --> 03:32.479
And no one's gonna bend or break me

03:32.607 --> 03:36.805
I can reach any star

03:37.967 --> 03:39.958
I've got faith

03:41.807 --> 03:44.924
I've got faith

03:45.487 --> 03:48.763
Faith of the heart

04:04.167 --> 04:07.637
I'm picking up weapons fire on E-Deck,
the starboard airlock.

04:07.767 --> 04:10.759
Send a security team.
Bridge to Captain Archer.

04:13.007 --> 04:15.805
The Tellarite ship's trying to undock
with the seals locked.

04:15.927 --> 04:18.077
Engage the emergency clamps.

04:24.967 --> 04:27.481
- He's going to warp.
- Pursuit course.

04:29.527 --> 04:32.678
He's disabled our starboard nacelle.
We can't follow him, sir.

04:32.807 --> 04:35.605
Get those teams up from the surface.

04:43.967 --> 04:45.958
We're having trouble
isolating his signature.

04:46.087 --> 04:48.043
He must have done something
to mask it.

04:48.167 --> 04:49.919
How long until we have warp drive?

04:50.047 --> 04:51.275
Less than an hour.

04:51.407 --> 04:52.726
I'm on my way to the Bridge.

04:52.847 --> 04:54.200
Acknowledged.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.966
I'm afraid you're not going anywhere
for the moment.

04:57.087 --> 05:00.079
We brought a stowaway with us,
a rather unusual microbe.

05:00.207 --> 05:03.119
- Is it contagious?
- I'll have to run some more tests.

05:03.247 --> 05:06.045
To be safe, we should
both go through Decon.

05:37.487 --> 05:39.079
What do you want?

05:42.047 --> 05:43.924
I asked you a question.

05:46.007 --> 05:48.441
I'd stay clear of those emitters
if I were you.

05:48.807 --> 05:50.684
The very latest technology.

05:50.807 --> 05:52.923
I installed them last month.

05:53.127 --> 05:55.925
I doubt this ship of yours will be
a match for Enterprise.

05:56.047 --> 05:57.958
I've taken appropriate countermeasures.

05:58.087 --> 06:01.045
We won't be seeing
any more of your starship.

06:02.607 --> 06:04.802
I want to know where you're taking me.

06:08.807 --> 06:11.526
My crew's not going to give up
until they find me.

06:12.727 --> 06:14.365
If you take me back...

06:14.487 --> 06:16.603
I'd be willing to forget
this ever happened.

06:16.727 --> 06:20.402
You can either be quiet or spend
the rest of this trip unconscious.

06:20.527 --> 06:21.880
Which do you prefer?

06:32.287 --> 06:35.199
This microbe is more resilient
than I thought.

06:36.287 --> 06:38.926
It doesn't seem to be vulnerable
to theta radiation.

06:39.047 --> 06:41.117
Perhaps you can increase the dosage.

06:41.247 --> 06:44.523
That wouldn't be advisable. We'd both
suffer permanent cellular damage.

06:44.647 --> 06:46.399
There must be something else
you can try.

06:46.527 --> 06:49.405
Decon gel "E" may neutralise
the microbe...

06:50.447 --> 06:54.042
but it will be several hours
before we know if it's effective.

06:54.167 --> 06:56.158
I can't stay here several hours.

06:56.407 --> 06:58.045
You have little choice.

06:58.927 --> 07:01.282
This organism appears
to be infectious...

07:01.727 --> 07:04.036
and humans would be
far more vulnerable to it...

07:04.167 --> 07:05.759
than you or I.

07:07.127 --> 07:08.924
Commander Tucker is quite capable.

07:09.047 --> 07:11.959
If he needs your help,
he knows where to find you.

07:27.287 --> 07:31.803
Fortunately, no one else on the surface
was exposed to the microbe.

07:32.207 --> 07:34.243
I suspect you and I were contaminated...

07:34.367 --> 07:36.835
when we climbed
into the second ravine.

07:36.967 --> 07:39.083
Considering the quantity
of fauna down there...

07:39.207 --> 07:41.118
I'm not at all surprised.

07:41.287 --> 07:45.121
We were probably infected
by the marsupials I found.

07:45.407 --> 07:47.523
I told you to leave them alone.

07:47.687 --> 07:50.679
Their saliva is a natural anticoagulant.

07:50.807 --> 07:53.401
I couldn't return to the ship
without a sample.

08:00.167 --> 08:02.044
I could use your assistance.

08:10.567 --> 08:12.478
I wasn't aware a curtain was installed.

08:12.607 --> 08:14.484
Not everyone's comfortable
with the idea...

08:14.607 --> 08:16.677
of disrobing in front of others.

08:16.807 --> 08:18.843
An odd attitude for a physician.

08:19.007 --> 08:20.884
It's a characteristic of Denobulan males.

08:21.007 --> 08:23.965
We are more inhibited than our women.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.840
It's led to a number
of awkward moments.

08:27.327 --> 08:31.445
My Starfleet physical was an experience
I never hope to repeat.

08:42.047 --> 08:43.799
If you wouldn't mind.

08:55.287 --> 08:57.801
Sensors are picking up
a faint warp signature.

08:57.927 --> 08:59.519
Can you get a fix on it?

08:59.727 --> 09:01.797
Bearing 0-7-1, mark 3-2.

09:01.927 --> 09:05.317
It's erratic, but it matches
our Tellarite friend.

09:05.447 --> 09:07.563
Set a course, maximum warp.

09:13.167 --> 09:14.805
You are speaking on a secure channel.

09:14.927 --> 09:16.918
I'm trying to reach Captain Goroth.

09:17.047 --> 09:19.322
It's very important that I speak with him.

09:19.447 --> 09:22.280
We're attempting to transfer you.
Stand by.

09:23.167 --> 09:25.158
This is Goroth. What do you want?

09:25.287 --> 09:27.005
I have the fugitive.

09:27.247 --> 09:29.124
He's in your custody?

09:30.447 --> 09:32.677
He's standing about five metres
from me.

09:32.807 --> 09:34.843
You'll be pleased to know
he's still alive.

09:34.967 --> 09:37.276
I'm bringing him to Kronos
as we agreed.

09:37.407 --> 09:40.604
No. I'm transmitting
rendezvous coordinates.

09:40.727 --> 09:42.160
Be there in two days.

09:42.287 --> 09:44.801
I trust you'll have the full payment?

09:44.927 --> 09:46.565
You'll get what was promised.

09:46.687 --> 09:49.520
Pleasure doing business
with you, Captain.

09:50.767 --> 09:52.325
As always.

09:52.607 --> 09:54.404
How much are they paying you?

09:57.047 --> 09:59.925
You mentioned the Klingon
home world, Kronos.

10:01.607 --> 10:04.758
I assume this has something to do
with my escaping prison.

10:08.687 --> 10:10.917
You don't even know
what I'm accused of.

10:11.047 --> 10:13.800
You're right, and I don't care to.

10:29.407 --> 10:30.999
The signature's holding steady.

10:31.127 --> 10:33.197
It looks like he's orbiting a G-Type star.

10:33.327 --> 10:35.283
Go to Tactical Alert.

10:39.407 --> 10:41.318
It appears to be a beacon of some kind.

10:41.447 --> 10:44.405
It's generating a warp signature
identical to the Tellarite's.

10:44.527 --> 10:47.121
A decoy! Anything on sensors?

10:49.407 --> 10:51.045
We're going to have to start all over.

10:51.167 --> 10:53.476
I'm getting too much interference
from that device.

10:53.607 --> 10:55.404
It's throwing off our scans.

10:55.527 --> 10:58.803
- Then get rid of it.
- With pleasure, sir.

11:08.087 --> 11:10.726
I have no idea
what the Klingons are paying you...

11:10.847 --> 11:12.724
but whatever it is...

11:13.327 --> 11:14.646
Starfleet will double it.

11:14.767 --> 11:16.439
I don't take bribes from criminals.

11:16.567 --> 11:18.159
I'm not a criminal.

11:18.327 --> 11:20.795
Klingon Judiciary says that you are.

11:20.967 --> 11:24.084
My "crime" was helping
a ship full of refugees.

11:24.847 --> 11:27.156
That was very noble of you.

11:27.327 --> 11:30.444
You'll think twice
before doing that again.

11:31.407 --> 11:34.683
It's pretty clear
I'm never going to get the chance.

11:36.007 --> 11:40.285
I was sentenced to life in prison
on Rura Penthe.

11:40.607 --> 11:42.199
Ever heard of it?

11:42.647 --> 11:44.603
I'm familiar with Rura Penthe.

11:45.007 --> 11:48.636
The magistrate isn't going to be
so lenient next time.

11:51.167 --> 11:53.158
I'll probably be executed.

11:55.807 --> 11:57.160
That's not my concern.

11:57.287 --> 12:00.006
You don't care that you're sending
an innocent man to die?

12:00.127 --> 12:02.561
I've captured dozens of fugitives.

12:02.687 --> 12:05.918
Every one of them claimed to be
an innocent man.

12:06.047 --> 12:08.880
If the Klingons wanted them,
they probably were.

12:10.007 --> 12:12.043
You don't have to do this.

12:12.487 --> 12:14.603
Goroth already knows you're aboard.

12:14.727 --> 12:18.481
If I don't deliver you,
he'll offer a reward for both of us.

12:19.887 --> 12:22.242
I've learned never to cross a Klingon.

12:25.047 --> 12:26.605
It must be difficult...

12:28.447 --> 12:30.324
working for people like them.

12:30.567 --> 12:33.798
I don't answer to those savages.
I work for myself.

12:35.447 --> 12:37.756
That's not how it looks from in here.

12:40.727 --> 12:42.797
If you knew how much
they were paying me...

12:42.927 --> 12:44.440
you'd understand.

12:45.127 --> 12:47.402
This has nothing to do with you.

12:48.527 --> 12:50.677
I'm sure you're not a bad person...

12:51.527 --> 12:53.279
just an unlucky one.

13:13.287 --> 13:15.960
You're making it difficult to meditate.

13:16.607 --> 13:18.279
You've developed a slight fever.

13:18.407 --> 13:21.080
I'm also reading
elevated dopamine levels.

13:21.327 --> 13:24.000
The microbe may be affecting
your limbic system.

13:24.127 --> 13:26.960
I can't concentrate
under these conditions.

13:27.087 --> 13:29.237
I don't mean to be intrusive.

13:29.367 --> 13:31.323
The Captain's been abducted.

13:31.447 --> 13:32.960
He may even be dead.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.241
- My place is on the Bridge.
- Subcommander!

13:40.207 --> 13:41.845
Where are you going?

13:44.127 --> 13:45.321
Open it.

13:45.447 --> 13:46.800
You'll spread the infection.

13:46.927 --> 13:50.237
I'll go to my quarters.
If I seal off the ventilation system...

13:50.367 --> 13:52.961
it should minimise
the risk of exposing anyone.

13:53.087 --> 13:54.679
Your quarters are on C-Deck.

13:54.807 --> 13:57.605
By the time you reach them,
you'll contaminate half the ship.

13:57.887 --> 13:59.764
Unlock this door.

14:02.367 --> 14:04.756
I gave you a direct order.

14:05.327 --> 14:08.478
- I'm sorry, but I can't obey it.
- I can have you court-martialled.

14:08.607 --> 14:10.996
- I doubt that very much.
- Open it!

14:19.607 --> 14:21.006
I apologise.

14:22.727 --> 14:25.560
I'm having trouble
suppressing my emotions.

14:27.087 --> 14:30.397
We'll know in a few hours
whether the gel is working.

14:30.647 --> 14:32.126
Until then...

14:32.807 --> 14:35.401
perhaps a mild sedative will help.

14:40.647 --> 14:43.286
The Klingons are paying 9,000 darseks.

14:43.407 --> 14:45.477
That's more than enough
to get Tezra back.

14:45.607 --> 14:47.404
You're not being realistic.

14:47.527 --> 14:51.520
I already have the human in custody.
The reward is guaranteed.

14:51.647 --> 14:53.603
You've made this promise before.

14:53.727 --> 14:57.037
In two days, you'll see
I'm telling the truth.

14:57.167 --> 14:59.283
Even if you get the money,
which I doubt...

14:59.407 --> 15:01.602
it wouldn't change my decision.

15:01.727 --> 15:04.605
Do you want to scrub plasma injectors
the rest of your life?

15:04.727 --> 15:06.604
I'm giving you a chance to...

15:13.407 --> 15:14.522
Who's Tezra?

15:14.647 --> 15:17.844
Tezra's not a person. It's a cargo ship.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.402
Far more impressive than this antique.

15:21.527 --> 15:24.087
You're going to use the reward
to buy your ship back?

15:24.327 --> 15:26.204
You'd be wise to keep quiet.

15:26.327 --> 15:29.956
The Klingons pay me the same
whether you're alive or dead.

15:32.527 --> 15:34.245
A vessel's approaching.

15:34.367 --> 15:37.757
I wouldn't get too optimistic.
It's not your starship.

15:44.927 --> 15:46.963
You have something I want.

15:47.367 --> 15:50.086
Always one step behind me, Kago?

15:50.367 --> 15:53.643
Drop out of warp
and surrender the prisoner.

15:53.847 --> 15:55.200
Why would I do that?

15:55.327 --> 15:57.636
Don't force me to take action.

15:58.007 --> 16:00.965
Goroth told you where I was, didn't he?

16:01.087 --> 16:03.521
You had two months to find the human.

16:03.927 --> 16:05.042
Goroth contacted me...

16:05.167 --> 16:08.159
because you obviously
weren't going to succeed.

16:08.287 --> 16:09.800
You're incompetent!

16:09.927 --> 16:14.045
If I was incompetent, Archer would be
aboard your ship, wouldn't he?

16:14.287 --> 16:17.085
The human, now.

16:17.647 --> 16:20.115
Or what? You'll destroy my shuttle?

16:20.247 --> 16:22.966
Can't collect on Archer
if he's a cloud of vapour.

16:24.087 --> 16:26.601
You may want to hold onto something.

16:40.327 --> 16:41.760
Let me out! I can help you.

16:41.887 --> 16:44.162
You must think I'm a fool.

16:46.487 --> 16:50.116
You can't manoeuvre the ship
and make repairs at the same time.

16:51.087 --> 16:53.521
I'm a pilot. Let me take the helm.

16:55.767 --> 16:57.723
If you try to escape...

17:08.007 --> 17:11.317
This is the warp field regulator,
the impulse throttle.

17:11.446 --> 17:13.801
- Navigation sensors?
- There.

17:16.567 --> 17:18.717
There's an L-Class planet
in this system.

17:18.847 --> 17:20.963
- I'm taking us out of warp.
- What?

17:21.087 --> 17:23.760
We can't outrun him,
but he may not be able to navigate...

17:23.887 --> 17:25.877
as well as we can
in the planet's atmosphere.

17:35.687 --> 17:38.360
This ship wasn't designed
for these manoeuvres.

17:41.567 --> 17:43.558
We've lost the aft cannons.

17:43.687 --> 17:46.247
- What about forward cannons?
- Still on-line.

17:48.567 --> 17:49.886
What are these?

17:50.127 --> 17:53.756
Subspace beacons.
They generate a false warp signature.

17:53.887 --> 17:55.923
I used one of them to evade your vessel.

17:56.047 --> 17:57.526
Get ready to launch them.

17:57.647 --> 17:58.875
What good will that do?

17:59.007 --> 18:00.599
He's flying on sensors, just like we are.

18:00.727 --> 18:03.719
He'll only have a 1-in-3 chance
of targeting us.

18:04.967 --> 18:06.082
Ready.

18:06.327 --> 18:07.362
Now.

18:24.127 --> 18:25.879
We knocked out his engine.

18:26.087 --> 18:27.839
He's making an emergency landing.

18:28.007 --> 18:30.726
Don't celebrate yet.
Our reactor's leaking.

18:30.847 --> 18:34.886
The warp drive's off-line.
I'm never going to make the rendezvous.

18:35.527 --> 18:37.199
Isn't that a shame?

18:37.447 --> 18:40.405
The reactor also powers life support.

18:40.527 --> 18:41.880
Then you'd better get to work.

18:42.007 --> 18:44.840
It can only be accessed
from the outer hull.

18:45.407 --> 18:48.558
- Then we should set down here.
- But Kago's on the surface.

18:48.687 --> 18:51.155
We'll land 1,000 kilometres away.

19:00.927 --> 19:02.599
What are you doing?

19:03.167 --> 19:05.727
You said we'd need another treatment.

19:06.087 --> 19:07.679
Not for three hours.

19:07.927 --> 19:09.440
Is there any harm in starting now?

19:09.567 --> 19:12.877
I can apply it myself. Thank you.

19:14.527 --> 19:16.279
Perhaps you need another sedative.

19:16.407 --> 19:18.045
Rest is not what I need.

19:18.167 --> 19:20.237
This behaviour is hardly appropriate.

19:20.367 --> 19:22.039
My name is T'Pol.

19:23.007 --> 19:27.205
- You don't find me attractive?
- Of course I do, but that is not the issue.

19:27.327 --> 19:29.887
I'm familiar with Denobulan sexuality.

19:30.207 --> 19:32.163
I know that your marriages
aren't exclusive.

19:32.287 --> 19:34.084
You and I are colleagues.

19:34.207 --> 19:37.404
- It's against regulations.
- Starfleet regulations.

19:37.647 --> 19:40.286
There's no reason to be restrained
by human morality.

19:40.407 --> 19:43.126
It's obvious you're not well. Please.

19:45.367 --> 19:48.723
You have no idea
what you're denying yourself.

19:49.207 --> 19:52.165
Your endorphin and hormonal levels
are dangerously high.

19:52.287 --> 19:53.766
You don't understand. I'm not ill.

19:53.887 --> 19:55.605
These are hardly normal readings.

19:55.727 --> 19:58.560
They're normal for a Vulcan
in my condition.

19:59.487 --> 20:01.717
You know what's wrong with you?

20:02.807 --> 20:05.560
It's not something
we discuss with others.

20:07.527 --> 20:10.724
I believe it's time for you
to amend that policy.

20:11.607 --> 20:14.679
You have my assurance
it will remain between us.

20:16.727 --> 20:18.718
We call it the pon farr...

20:19.487 --> 20:21.239
the cycle of mating.

20:22.767 --> 20:25.156
Have you gone through this before?

20:27.007 --> 20:28.440
It's not time.

20:29.287 --> 20:31.243
It's possible the infection was a catalyst.

20:31.367 --> 20:33.562
What caused it doesn't matter.

20:33.927 --> 20:37.237
If I don't mate with a male,
Vulcan or otherwise, I'll die.

20:48.847 --> 20:51.281
That ship you mentioned, the Tezra...

20:53.007 --> 20:54.520
sounds pretty important to you.

20:54.647 --> 20:56.365
More than you know.

20:57.047 --> 20:59.686
If Kago collects the reward...

20:59.927 --> 21:02.964
he'll probably waste it
on Orion slave girls.

21:03.887 --> 21:04.922
Not me.

21:05.367 --> 21:07.801
I'm going to do something useful with it.

21:07.927 --> 21:10.839
I don't understand
why you want a cargo ship.

21:11.127 --> 21:13.516
It doesn't seem practical
in your line of work.

21:13.687 --> 21:16.997
You think I've been chasing fugitives
my entire life?

21:17.887 --> 21:22.403
Once I get the money, I'll have enough
to pay off the impound fees.

21:23.047 --> 21:24.799
I'll be a freighter captain again.

21:25.007 --> 21:27.282
My helmsman used to run freight.

21:27.567 --> 21:30.127
The two of you would probably have
a lot to talk about.

21:30.247 --> 21:32.966
The Tezra isn't like
any other cargo ship.

21:33.087 --> 21:36.523
She was the first of her class,
the fastest ever built.

21:37.967 --> 21:41.323
She could haul a million metric tonnes
at warp 4.5.

21:41.447 --> 21:45.759
Even your starship isn't capable of that.
I retrofitted her engines myself.

21:45.887 --> 21:48.007
You never told me
why it was impounded.

21:48.007 --> 21:48.519
You never told me
why it was impounded.

21:49.287 --> 21:52.643
My brother and I were hauling
a shipment of firesalt.

21:54.527 --> 21:57.246
I thought I could trim two or three days
off our journey...

21:57.367 --> 21:59.835
by cutting across
the most insignificant corner...

21:59.967 --> 22:01.605
of Klingon space.

22:02.047 --> 22:04.163
I learned very quickly
there's no such thing...

22:04.287 --> 22:06.926
as an insignificant corner
of Klingon space.

22:07.807 --> 22:10.480
We were lucky to escape
with our lives...

22:10.807 --> 22:12.843
though we did pay a price.

22:13.647 --> 22:16.445
- They took your ship?
- And its cargo, too.

22:16.607 --> 22:18.723
My brother never forgave me.

22:18.847 --> 22:21.919
I've been trying to find a way
to get the Tezra back ever since.

22:22.047 --> 22:23.719
What are you doing?

22:27.447 --> 22:30.166
Did you really think
I wanted this engine fixed?

22:30.287 --> 22:32.596
You're taking me to be executed!

22:40.567 --> 22:42.000
Don't worry.

22:42.207 --> 22:43.845
We'll meet Goroth on time.

22:55.247 --> 22:56.919
Feeling any better?

23:00.847 --> 23:02.166
I'm hungry.

23:03.287 --> 23:05.437
Our meals will be here soon.

23:05.887 --> 23:07.923
I wasn't referring to food.

23:09.367 --> 23:11.403
I'm working as quickly as I can.

23:11.527 --> 23:14.963
The serum should help alleviate
most of your symptoms.

23:16.687 --> 23:18.962
There's a far simpler treatment.

23:19.647 --> 23:22.764
I'd prefer to explore
a more conventional approach.

23:24.767 --> 23:26.758
You have the cure.

23:27.367 --> 23:30.086
It's unethical for you
to withhold it, Doctor.

23:30.207 --> 23:32.562
This mating cycle of yours
was artificially induced.

23:32.687 --> 23:36.362
We can't be certain that
a physical encounter would help.

23:36.487 --> 23:39.126
- I'm willing to try.
- Subcommander...

23:40.607 --> 23:43.121
Don't be frightened. I won't hurt you.

23:43.247 --> 23:44.999
You're disturbing my serum!

23:45.127 --> 23:47.960
- You need to be sedated again.
- No more hyposprays!

23:49.607 --> 23:52.246
One of us should probably answer that.

23:52.367 --> 23:54.483
It could be news about the Captain.

23:59.087 --> 24:00.406
This is Phlox.

24:00.527 --> 24:03.678
Anyone hungry in there?
I brought you some supper.

24:05.927 --> 24:08.441
Just in the nick of time, Commander.

24:11.287 --> 24:13.517
It would be best if you remained here.

24:20.567 --> 24:22.603
How are you two holding up?

24:22.767 --> 24:24.166
Well enough.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.998
Have you been able
to locate Captain Archer?

24:29.527 --> 24:33.725
We're tracking another warp signature.
Hopefully, this one's the real thing.

24:33.847 --> 24:35.644
Are those the ones you wanted?

24:35.767 --> 24:37.439
Yes, thank you.

24:37.967 --> 24:39.320
Is that food?

24:39.567 --> 24:40.636
Yeah.

24:41.727 --> 24:44.195
I had Chef make you some...

24:48.247 --> 24:49.600
Is she all right?

24:50.287 --> 24:54.075
She's developed a slight fever,
nothing to be concerned about.

24:58.687 --> 25:00.723
Bridge to Commander Tucker.

25:01.127 --> 25:03.357
- Go ahead.
- We're approaching the coordinates.

25:03.487 --> 25:04.806
On my way.

25:06.567 --> 25:08.364
Call if you need anything.

25:21.007 --> 25:22.156
What have you got?

25:22.287 --> 25:25.006
Two matching warp signatures,
both in the upper-atmosphere.

25:25.127 --> 25:28.085
More subspace beacons.
There is a ship on the surface.

25:28.207 --> 25:31.517
It seems to have suffered
engine damage, but it's not Tellarite.

25:31.647 --> 25:33.638
- Bio-signs?
- One.

25:35.527 --> 25:37.006
Open a channel.

25:39.487 --> 25:40.522
Yes?

25:40.887 --> 25:44.675
Sorry to bother you,
but we're looking for a Tellarite shuttle.

25:44.807 --> 25:46.638
Have you seen one?

25:46.767 --> 25:49.042
How much did the Klingons offer you?

25:49.167 --> 25:50.441
Klingons?

25:53.287 --> 25:56.085
Look, there must be some sort
of misunderstanding here.

25:56.207 --> 25:57.720
We're looking for our captain.

25:57.847 --> 26:00.919
Your captain.
He's got a price on his head.

26:01.047 --> 26:04.278
He's probably halfway
to Klingon space by now.

26:08.567 --> 26:11.559
Travis, how close are we
to Klingon space?

26:12.367 --> 26:14.403
Less than six light-years.

26:14.527 --> 26:17.758
If that Tellarite's looking
to collect some kind of reward...

26:17.887 --> 26:20.242
we better find him before he gets there.

26:20.367 --> 26:22.881
- Set a course. Take us back to warp.
- Aye, sir.

26:33.487 --> 26:36.365
- What are you doing here?
- I need your help.

26:37.087 --> 26:38.406
You shouldn't have brought him.

26:38.527 --> 26:41.360
You think I would have come here
if I had a choice?

26:41.527 --> 26:43.722
I need an antimatter injector.

26:44.607 --> 26:46.837
And I suppose you have no way
of paying for it.

26:46.967 --> 26:48.446
Do you know who this is?

26:48.567 --> 26:51.764
He's the only prisoner
who's ever escaped from Rura Penthe.

26:51.887 --> 26:55.402
The Klingons are offering a fortune
to get him back. Tell him.

26:56.487 --> 26:57.966
Tell him!

26:59.967 --> 27:04.324
If I give you the injector, you have
to promise never to come back here.

27:04.767 --> 27:07.998
Of course I'm coming back.
You're going to be my first officer.

27:08.127 --> 27:10.595
That was years ago. I work here now.

27:10.727 --> 27:12.126
Scrubbing plasma injectors?

27:12.247 --> 27:13.999
Is that how your children
should see you?

27:14.127 --> 27:15.640
It's better than hunting criminals!

27:15.767 --> 27:19.555
You think that I enjoy spending my time
with vermin like him?

27:20.487 --> 27:22.079
I have work to do.

27:22.207 --> 27:24.880
Please! Don't turn your back
on me again.

27:25.167 --> 27:27.317
We can reclaim the Tezra.

27:29.007 --> 27:31.760
You won't want that ship
after you see it.

27:32.367 --> 27:33.561
Why not?

27:35.407 --> 27:39.798
The Klingons cannibalised her.
Every power relay, every conduit.

27:40.287 --> 27:42.960
- The engines?
- They're gone.

27:45.127 --> 27:47.197
I'll give you the injector...

27:47.647 --> 27:50.719
but after that, I want you to leave.

28:03.527 --> 28:05.563
What do you plan to do now?

28:05.967 --> 28:08.117
Get that injector and install it.

28:08.247 --> 28:09.521
And then?

28:15.007 --> 28:17.680
I suppose you'll turn me over
to the Klingons.

28:18.647 --> 28:19.682
I'll be...

28:20.967 --> 28:24.676
disembowelled with one of those
nasty-looking swords of theirs.

28:27.647 --> 28:30.559
And you'll collect your 9,000 darseks.

28:32.967 --> 28:35.003
But it won't get you the Tezra back.

28:35.167 --> 28:36.759
What are you trying to say?

28:37.127 --> 28:40.437
The Klingons took your freighter,
your livelihood...

28:43.367 --> 28:46.200
damaged your relationship
with your brother.

28:47.567 --> 28:49.478
And what do you get in exchange?

28:50.047 --> 28:51.878
9,000 darseks.

28:53.767 --> 28:56.679
Doesn't seem like
a very fair trade to me.

28:57.327 --> 28:59.079
What choice do I have?

28:59.207 --> 29:02.563
I told you, if I let you go, they'd kill me.

29:03.607 --> 29:04.881
Maybe not.

29:06.527 --> 29:08.757
Have you ever been
aboard Goroth's ship?

29:10.287 --> 29:12.084
Twice. Why?

29:23.287 --> 29:24.959
I beg your pardon?

29:27.727 --> 29:29.160
Let me out.

29:29.687 --> 29:31.040
You know I can't do that.

29:31.207 --> 29:33.960
The heat, it's unbearable!

29:34.087 --> 29:36.726
If I lower the temperature,
the serum will congeal.

29:36.847 --> 29:39.202
I don't want your serum! Open the door!

29:39.327 --> 29:42.205
I assure you, you'll feel much better
in just a few minutes.

29:42.327 --> 29:43.555
Open it!

29:44.487 --> 29:46.318
This will only take a moment.

29:49.647 --> 29:52.036
Your bio-chemical imbalance
is growing worse.

29:52.167 --> 29:54.806
If we don't treat it, the damage
to your limbic system...

29:54.927 --> 29:57.839
could be irreversible.
You said it yourself, it could kill you!

29:57.967 --> 29:59.605
Stay away from me.

30:00.167 --> 30:02.397
One injection. That's all I ask.

30:07.567 --> 30:08.886
Very well...

30:11.287 --> 30:12.925
you're free to go.

30:13.047 --> 30:15.436
4-2-8-6-4. That's the locking code.

30:16.207 --> 30:19.882
Denobulan medical ethics prevent me
from treating patients against their will.

30:20.527 --> 30:22.722
4-2-8-6-4!

31:30.327 --> 31:32.522
- Phlox to the Bridge.
- Tucker here.

31:32.647 --> 31:34.922
You may want to evacuate D-Deck.

31:42.007 --> 31:45.920
She's still in this section.
The Doctor says she's irrational...

31:46.367 --> 31:48.437
- so use caution.
- Yes, sir.

31:58.967 --> 32:00.195
Malcolm!

32:06.007 --> 32:07.565
I need your assistance.

32:07.687 --> 32:09.917
We've been very worried about you,
Subcommander.

32:10.047 --> 32:12.117
Let's get you back to the doctor.

32:12.247 --> 32:15.762
I can't return to the doctor.
He's refusing to treat me.

32:19.207 --> 32:20.845
How long has it been?

32:20.967 --> 32:22.685
I beg your pardon?

32:23.047 --> 32:24.765
Since you've mated.

32:27.447 --> 32:29.517
I've seen the way you look at me.

32:32.007 --> 32:33.725
On the Bridge.

32:34.007 --> 32:36.601
Why don't we discuss this in Decon?

32:37.167 --> 32:39.965
My quarters would be more comfortable.

32:42.207 --> 32:44.960
Doctor Phlox was very insistent.

33:12.847 --> 33:14.644
Follow me, Subcommander.

33:35.607 --> 33:36.926
Welcome.

33:43.927 --> 33:47.476
The Empire never forgets
its enemies. Taka!

33:48.887 --> 33:50.400
What about my payment?

33:54.047 --> 33:55.605
6,000 darseks.

33:55.887 --> 33:57.445
We agreed to 9,000.

33:57.567 --> 33:58.761
Did we?

34:00.327 --> 34:04.115
That's blood money, Skalaar.
I hope you enjoy it.

34:20.206 --> 34:22.277
We're being hailed, Commander.

34:23.447 --> 34:25.516
- It's the Tellarite ship.
- What?

34:28.887 --> 34:30.114
Put him through.

35:48.207 --> 35:51.358
I've got them. Bearing 2-2-6, mark 7-1.

35:51.687 --> 35:54.918
Set a course. Go to Tactical Alert.

36:38.607 --> 36:40.598
Where do you think you'll go, human?

36:40.727 --> 36:43.287
There isn't a planet
within 50 light-years.

37:01.927 --> 37:04.236
He won't get far. Drop out of warp.

37:04.367 --> 37:07.484
- Should I charge weapons?
- No. I want him alive.

37:12.887 --> 37:15.401
I see him. 800,000 kilometres.

37:15.527 --> 37:18.166
- What about the Klingons?
- They're closing in on him.

37:29.047 --> 37:30.685
They're charging weapons.

37:31.367 --> 37:32.641
Return fire!

37:34.087 --> 37:35.520
Deploy the grappler.

37:37.127 --> 37:38.606
They're not making it easy.

37:38.727 --> 37:40.638
- Malcolm?
- I'm doing the best I can, sir.

37:40.767 --> 37:43.076
Their weapon ports
are heavily shielded.

37:56.687 --> 37:58.086
- Got it!
- Bring him in.

38:05.927 --> 38:08.316
- Their weapons are down.
- The pod?

38:10.127 --> 38:12.402
Safe and sound. Launch Bay Two.

38:12.647 --> 38:14.126
Let's get the hell out of here.

38:27.567 --> 38:30.684
The microbe's been eliminated
from your system.

38:30.807 --> 38:33.401
Your premature mating cycle
has ended.

38:39.047 --> 38:41.322
Did I do anything inappropriate?

38:42.367 --> 38:44.642
I've had patients treat me far worse.

38:48.847 --> 38:49.836
Did we?

38:49.967 --> 38:53.516
Denobulan males aren't comfortable
discussing such topics.

38:55.407 --> 38:58.604
I'd appreciate it
if you didn't mention this to anyone.

38:58.767 --> 39:01.122
I'd never violate a patient's privacy.

39:11.487 --> 39:12.966
Rough ride?

39:14.007 --> 39:15.645
What's the status of the Klingons?

39:15.767 --> 39:19.316
We damaged their port nacelle.
They're limping back to Kronos.

39:22.327 --> 39:23.760
Where's T'Pol?

39:25.527 --> 39:27.836
She's in Decon with Doctor Phlox.

39:28.287 --> 39:29.515
What happened?

39:30.367 --> 39:31.880
It's a long story.

39:33.207 --> 39:35.038
You're being hailed, Captain.

39:37.287 --> 39:39.243
I see you made it back safely.

39:39.367 --> 39:41.881
You think the Klingons know
you gave me that lock pick?

39:42.007 --> 39:43.838
I don't see why they would.

39:45.607 --> 39:47.802
What are you going to do
with your reward?

39:47.927 --> 39:49.121
I'm not sure.

39:49.567 --> 39:52.445
If you know of an old freighter
for sale...

39:52.887 --> 39:54.843
I'll keep my eyes open.

39:55.287 --> 39:56.845
Be careful, Captain.

39:57.367 --> 40:00.359
It's likely the Klingons will double
their bounty.

40:00.687 --> 40:03.076
I hope you won't be the one to collect it.

40:03.207 --> 40:04.560
No promises.
