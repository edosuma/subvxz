See you later. OK, see you later,
darling. Next week.

01:04.519 --> 01:08.147
COBRA at eight, Education Secretary
at nine, Foreign Secretary after.

01:08.147 --> 01:11.276
Then to Leicester, factory visit,
lunch, press conference,

01:11.276 --> 01:12.694
back to London, the House.

01:12.694 --> 01:15.530
I'm not doing the backbenchers.
They don't interest me.

01:15.530 --> 01:18.158
Anthea can do them. Sir, you agreed.
I'm not doing it.

01:31.506 --> 01:34.468
6:30, French President,
reception, dinner, bi-lateral talks.

01:34.468 --> 01:37.054
And it's your mother's birthday.
OK. And she gets...

01:37.054 --> 01:39.598
A handbag. Very nice.
I've seen it. All right.

01:39.598 --> 01:43.185
Oh...I was promised news
of Worricker. None.

CHURCH BELL CHIMING

02:12.091 --> 02:14.886
I heard you come in.
Are you all right?

02:14.886 --> 02:16.429
Yeah, I'm fine. How was it?

02:16.429 --> 02:18.640
Pretty brilliant.
I was brilliant, I mean.

02:18.640 --> 02:20.142
And them?

02:20.142 --> 02:22.603
Yes. They responded brilliantly.

02:22.603 --> 02:24.104
Good. I'm glad you're back.

02:26.899 --> 02:28.818
Let's go to bed.

02:33.489 --> 02:35.575
Morning. Prime Minister.

02:42.708 --> 02:45.085
Express - Bill's in
trouble in Kiev.

02:45.085 --> 02:49.215
Independent -
Deputy Prime Minister's husband
on bribery charges.

02:49.215 --> 02:53.970
The Sun - Billy Whizz does a runner.
Deputy PM's man flees questions.

02:55.430 --> 03:00.602
Times - Catcheside faces Kiev
bribery allegations.

03:00.602 --> 03:05.566

husband accused by Kiev.

SHE SIGHS

04:12.388 --> 04:17.435
Bill! Just two seconds of your time.
Just two seconds. Bill! Bill!

04:19.853 --> 04:21.898
What does the PM
think about the backhanders?

04:21.898 --> 04:25.986
Is it true your wife is
planning to resign?
Come on, Bill, how much did you...

04:27.696 --> 04:29.156
You're up.

04:29.156 --> 04:30.324
Yes.

04:30.324 --> 04:33.118
I'm surprised. I left you sleeping.
Mm.

04:33.118 --> 04:34.412
Here.

04:36.622 --> 04:38.458
We could MAKE coffee, you know.

04:38.458 --> 04:41.127
I never make coffee, I buy it.

04:41.127 --> 04:42.670
I've noticed.

04:44.172 --> 04:46.216
It's better. I see more.

05:03.985 --> 05:07.364
Mrs Catcheside. Mrs Catcheside!
This way, Mrs Catcheside!

05:07.364 --> 05:10.867
Mrs Catcheside,
did you accompany him to Kiev?

05:10.867 --> 05:14.538
ALL ASK QUESTIONS AT ONCE

05:14.538 --> 05:15.956
Anthea?

06:13.727 --> 06:17.189
SHE SIGHS
Oh, God!
HE LAUGHS

06:38.295 --> 06:41.173
Sorry, Prime Minister,
it's my fault, I overlooked this.

06:41.173 --> 06:42.341
Yes?

06:42.341 --> 06:44.051
It's in the Independent. Well?

06:44.051 --> 06:46.262
It's about the Bridge.
It's strangely worded

06:46.262 --> 06:49.015
but it's asking where the
financing comes from.

06:49.015 --> 06:51.810
Is Stirling Rogers mentioned?
He is.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.812
And the Americans? Yes.

06:55.856 --> 07:01.111
It's suggesting that you might be
preparing to move out of
Downing Street. Well, I'm not.

07:08.244 --> 07:10.872
So? So, what shall I say?

07:10.872 --> 07:13.625
Well, we say nothing.
If we go near the fire, we feed it.

07:13.625 --> 07:16.294
If we ignore it, it dies.
That's what I've learnt.

07:16.294 --> 07:19.006
In this case?
In this case specifically?

07:19.006 --> 07:20.549
In this case as others.

07:23.385 --> 07:25.513
By the way,
what's the journalist's name?

07:34.856 --> 07:37.776
And...when will she
be back in town, do you think?

07:41.196 --> 07:44.658
Allegra. How you getting on?
This little story of yours,

07:44.658 --> 07:46.076
where does it come from?

07:47.370 --> 07:48.955
I see. You're not saying anything.

07:48.955 --> 07:51.958
Well, when we get into court,
will it stand up? Let's hope so.

07:51.958 --> 07:54.544
You've run it very small.

07:54.544 --> 07:57.422
That's not me, that's editorial.

07:57.422 --> 07:58.465
OK.

SHE EXHALES

08:02.719 --> 08:04.972
MOBILE RINGS

08:08.184 --> 08:09.727
Well, of all people.

08:09.727 --> 08:12.021
I thought you weren't
answering your phone.

08:12.021 --> 08:13.982
I saw who it was.

08:13.982 --> 08:16.234
Is there somewhere you can go
to be private?

08:16.234 --> 08:19.779
You're crazy.
Have you read the papers?

08:19.779 --> 08:22.449
Obviously.
Well, there is no private.

08:22.449 --> 08:25.577
There hasn't been private
for getting on for a month.

08:26.704 --> 08:28.747
I need to see you.

08:31.250 --> 08:32.460
All right.

08:43.929 --> 08:46.058
MOBILE RINGS

08:46.058 --> 08:47.184
Hello.

08:47.184 --> 08:49.562
Rollo, bad news I'm afraid,
we've had to move on.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.981
Again? What is this, Grand Tour of
Europe? They're on to us.

08:51.981 --> 08:55.234
Who? How do you know? Because I
recognised a jogger in Heidelberg.

08:55.234 --> 08:57.445
I actually recruited her
five years ago.

08:57.445 --> 09:02.033
They don't get any cleverer,
do they? No, but we've all done
worse things in our time, or I have.

09:02.033 --> 09:05.203
Rollo, I need to know, is the
item in print? Yeah. This morning.

09:05.203 --> 09:07.247
Vague? Suitably.

09:07.247 --> 09:09.959
Any reaction?
Not yet. Too early.

09:09.959 --> 09:13.629
Never underestimate the British
journalist's ability
to miss a good story.

09:13.629 --> 09:16.507
Rollo, we need to get going.
This is feeling urgent.

09:16.507 --> 09:18.801
Can you come out and see me?
Don't think so. Why not?

09:18.801 --> 09:22.138
Because I've now got an admirer
of my own. Anyone we know?

09:22.138 --> 09:25.267
My impression is, the whole service
is working to one remit -

09:25.267 --> 09:26.935
find Johnny Worricker.

09:28.395 --> 09:31.148
Let me know as soon as we get
a reaction. Don't worry.

09:31.148 --> 09:34.402
It may take time but I'll bet
the farm he's going to jump.

09:35.736 --> 09:38.406
Morning, everyone.
ALL: Morning.

09:38.406 --> 09:39.574
Morning.

09:48.083 --> 09:50.419
I don't believe this.
You told me we had a deal.

09:50.419 --> 09:53.422
We did have a deal. And?

09:53.422 --> 09:55.633
Those friends of yours
paid back 200 million.

09:55.633 --> 09:57.802
That's what you told me.
It's true. To the CIA.

09:57.802 --> 10:00.805
And in return we were promised
the end of the story.

10:00.805 --> 10:04.142
I mean, we know who's behind this,
hmm? Worricker.

10:04.142 --> 10:07.479
He's a shit. Alec, think of it
his way. He's trapped.

10:07.479 --> 10:10.232
They're both trapped, the two of
them. They're...panicking.

10:10.232 --> 10:12.818
They can't live in exile
for the rest of their lives.

10:12.818 --> 10:17.156
I have to deal with all sorts of
people - truly - people I can't even
begin to describe to you... Sure.

10:17.156 --> 10:18.950
Fair enough, that's the job.

10:18.950 --> 10:22.078
It costs me nothing, I can do it
in my sleep. Honestly.

10:22.078 --> 10:24.914
But I demand one thing - people
have to stick to their word.

10:24.914 --> 10:28.001
What's he up to? What does he want?

10:28.001 --> 10:30.128
And this has happened before.

10:30.128 --> 10:32.506
He was meant to hand back that file.

10:32.506 --> 10:34.508
He went back on his promise.

10:34.508 --> 10:37.303
And now here we are, he's...
done it again.

10:37.303 --> 10:40.932
But you don't actually know that.
What, you think this item could be
coincidence?

10:40.932 --> 10:43.142
Don't jump to conclusions,
it may turn out to be innocent.

10:43.142 --> 10:46.062
Look at the wording -
it's all pretty vague.

10:46.062 --> 10:50.776
We don't even know the name of the
journalist. Well, exactly, but we
know the paper. We know its editor.

10:50.776 --> 10:53.153
Yeah?
You're a friend of Belinda's.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.782
Everyone's a friend of Belinda's.
What, pony parties, is it?

10:56.782 --> 10:59.535
Going up to Oxfordshire
for barbecues and gin?

10:59.535 --> 11:03.581
Her mother's a marchioness.
Lady...Sheep-dip, Lady Cotswolds,
I don't know.

11:03.581 --> 11:07.669
Which means she's not easy to reach.
She's so rich, so posh...
she doesn't give a fuck.

11:07.669 --> 11:10.213
That's the last thing we need.

11:10.213 --> 11:13.508
Alec...I don't like
to see you rattled.

11:13.508 --> 11:16.804
You've done nothing wrong, remember?
You're not on trial. Not yet.

11:16.804 --> 11:19.014
What charge are you meant
to be facing?

11:19.014 --> 11:22.143
You've started a foundation,
which is for when you leave office,

11:22.143 --> 11:25.563
to address major global issues
of war and peace.

11:25.563 --> 11:28.399
It's been part-funded by a group
of American entrepreneurs,

11:28.399 --> 11:32.529
who work in many diverse fields,
including the security business.

11:32.529 --> 11:35.574
So? Perhaps you'd like to tell me
what's wrong with that?

11:35.574 --> 11:37.075
Well, you know what's wrong.

11:37.075 --> 11:41.789
The world is complicated. People
have different interests. Public,
private. It's how things are now.

11:41.789 --> 11:45.168
It's not a question of how it is,
it's a question of how it appears.

11:45.168 --> 11:49.631
Especially when these
same Americans have been caught
ripping off the American taxpayer.

11:49.631 --> 11:52.592
They haven't been caught. Not
in public. And they never will be.

11:52.592 --> 11:56.847
Which is why it's essential
that you remain the public face
of the foundation.

11:56.847 --> 11:59.016
Stirling, your hands are clean.

11:59.016 --> 12:01.477
Certainly are. Spotless.

12:01.477 --> 12:03.437
I mean, what's happening here?

12:03.437 --> 12:06.440
I am trying to do something
important for my country.

12:06.440 --> 12:09.777
Because we're at war.
If only people would admit it.

12:09.777 --> 12:13.740
In one year Iran
will have a nuclear weapon.

12:13.740 --> 12:16.785
What, I'm just supposed to ignore
it? Just sit back, let it happen?

12:16.785 --> 12:20.289
Alec, you are the greatest
politician of the age.

12:20.289 --> 12:22.291
Your enemies are plankton.

12:22.291 --> 12:25.002
Truly.
Some rogue M15 man with a file!

12:25.002 --> 12:29.590
Is that what the Prime Minister of
Great Britain should be worrying
about first thing in the morning?

12:29.590 --> 12:32.510
Some tie-dyed arsehole
from the Turks and Caicos?

12:32.510 --> 12:34.971
Was he wearing tie-dye?
No, he wasn't.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.390
Then, why did you say it?

12:37.390 --> 12:39.434
Because it's a metaphor.

12:39.434 --> 12:41.520
And it's a joke! Huh, joke.

12:41.520 --> 12:43.230
Alec, think about it, seriously.

12:43.230 --> 12:45.900
Your people are out there,
they've got Europe locked down.

12:45.900 --> 12:48.945
By our count he's already moved
at least five times.

12:48.945 --> 12:51.823
There's no plan to it.

12:51.823 --> 12:54.993
Worricker's moving zigzag,
his brain's cotton wool,

12:54.993 --> 12:57.120
he's just a...rat on a map.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.081
And when we get him? What?

12:59.081 --> 13:01.834
I mean, when he's caught him.
Have you thought about that?

13:01.834 --> 13:06.172
Do you have any serious idea
of what we then do with him?
And the girlfriend.

13:06.172 --> 13:09.634
I've thought about it.
Good, because that's the next stage.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.928
Alec, you're getting this
out of proportion.

13:11.928 --> 13:15.473
No, getting him's the easy bit.
It's what we do with him then.

13:35.161 --> 13:37.372
What d'you think? Pretty nice.

13:37.372 --> 13:39.332
You'd better enjoy it.

13:39.332 --> 13:42.669
Why? How many more flats do we have?

13:42.669 --> 13:44.421
None.

13:44.421 --> 13:47.424
Well, don't look at me.
By my reckoning,
Wiesbaden's our fourth.

13:47.424 --> 13:50.261
You never could count. Tenth.

13:50.261 --> 13:51.804
You're including hotels.

13:51.804 --> 13:53.556
Yeah. How could I forget?

13:53.556 --> 13:56.017
And we're running out of money.
Great.

13:59.938 --> 14:01.648
So can we go home?

14:01.648 --> 14:03.275
HE CHUCKLES

14:10.616 --> 14:12.243
Brian...

14:12.243 --> 14:15.872
I've, er, got an unscheduled
meeting. I want somewhere secure.

14:15.872 --> 14:17.707
Not in your own office? I said.

14:17.707 --> 14:19.375
There's a room in the basement.

14:19.375 --> 14:20.877
Come on, then.

14:45.320 --> 14:47.239
I need to be left on my own.

14:47.239 --> 14:49.116
It's national security.

15:04.507 --> 15:07.427
It's kind of you
to make time for me.

15:07.427 --> 15:10.222
I wanted to see you
because I'm deeply concerned.

15:10.222 --> 15:11.890
Have you seen this?

15:11.890 --> 15:13.726
Tell me about it.

15:13.726 --> 15:15.853
I know security's
no longer your remit...

15:15.853 --> 15:18.856
I still get to see a lot of
high-grade intelligence.

15:18.856 --> 15:20.441
It passes across my desk.

15:20.441 --> 15:23.278
Yes, that's at my insistence.
Is it really? Yes.

15:23.278 --> 15:24.863
I didn't know that. Well, it is.

15:24.863 --> 15:29.576
I believe it's important
in government that the most
sensitive material

15:29.576 --> 15:32.871
is always seen
by more than one pair of eyes.

15:32.871 --> 15:34.456
You'll have to explain.

15:34.456 --> 15:37.877
The Prime Minister's judgment
has always been faultless.

15:37.877 --> 15:39.170
It certainly has.

15:39.170 --> 15:40.671
Don't get me wrong.

15:40.671 --> 15:42.757
He's a man who's called
every major issue

15:42.757 --> 15:44.843
of the last ten years correctly.

15:44.843 --> 15:48.096
And you're close to him. I am. I'm
very close. I owe him a great deal.

15:48.096 --> 15:52.017
He made you acting head
of the service. More than that,
he protected you. Yes.

15:52.017 --> 15:55.771
When you most needed protecting.
I'm in his debt. But?

15:55.771 --> 15:58.899
But it's also healthy for government
if there's a little air,

15:58.899 --> 16:02.403
a little...ventilation
around important decisions.

16:02.403 --> 16:05.490
That way things don't get...cramped.

16:09.327 --> 16:11.997
I don't know if you heard
about a murder in the Caribbean,

16:11.997 --> 16:13.832
a few months ago.

16:13.832 --> 16:16.877
Yes, I think I heard something.
A man with a strawberry mark?

16:16.877 --> 16:18.671
That's him. Yes, I saw a picture.

16:18.671 --> 16:21.382
But, to be honest,
it hasn't been my priority.

16:21.382 --> 16:22.592
I'm sure.

16:22.592 --> 16:25.178
I've had problems of my own.
My errant husband.

16:25.178 --> 16:28.556
Well, of course we may be able to
help you there. Sorry? Help me?

16:28.556 --> 16:31.977
I mean, we may be able to give you
information you may not have.

16:31.977 --> 16:33.562
About your husband.

16:35.230 --> 16:36.857
Stuff you don't know.

16:44.949 --> 16:46.326
What sort of stuff?

16:49.704 --> 16:52.666
Go on. What you were
saying about the murder.

16:52.666 --> 16:54.376
Have you heard of the Bridge?

16:54.376 --> 16:59.048
The Prime Minister's plan to
continue statesmanship beyond his
formal period of elected office?

16:59.048 --> 17:00.716
Yes. I've heard of it.

17:00.716 --> 17:03.719
Well, it was one of the donors
to that project that was killed.

17:03.719 --> 17:08.641
Do we know who by? And we've had
some questions recently about
the project's financing.

17:08.641 --> 17:11.102
It's financing?
Yes. How it's financed?

17:13.355 --> 17:18.484
Forgive me, but...I'm going to ask
a question, because time is short.

17:18.484 --> 17:22.239
Oh, by all means. It's this -
what's the subject of this meeting?

17:22.239 --> 17:24.492
What's the subject?
Yes. Give me a headline.

17:24.492 --> 17:27.118
Say, I'm going home, this evening
in the car, or in the bath,

17:27.118 --> 17:31.583
and I think, "I met Jill Tankard
today and we talked about..."

17:31.583 --> 17:34.544
What? What did we talk about?
What was the subject?

17:34.544 --> 17:37.506
I've come in to open up a channel.
What sort of channel?

17:37.506 --> 17:39.633
A channel of communication.

17:39.633 --> 17:41.385
To flag up potential trouble.

17:41.385 --> 17:45.765
It seems to me any trouble you're
talking of isn't for me,
it's for Alec. I think it may be.

17:46.849 --> 17:50.061
Frankly, Jill, what you're saying
doesn't add up to much.

17:50.061 --> 17:52.272
Doesn't it? I don't think so.
Why not?

17:52.272 --> 17:53.857
Because what's the beef here?

17:53.857 --> 17:56.193
In his eagerness for a life
beyond Downing Street,

17:56.193 --> 18:00.197
the Prime Minister
may have accidentally
befriended some dubious characters.

18:00.197 --> 18:05.536
Crooks. So? What he'll do when
he leaves government isn't strictly
a matter FOR the government.

18:05.536 --> 18:12.961
Isn't it? Maybe not, but
if people find out about it - and
this reference is the first sign -

18:12.961 --> 18:15.797
then we may enter rough water.

18:15.797 --> 18:19.259
And in rough water it'll be
to your personal advantage

18:19.259 --> 18:23.222
to be briefed about what's coming up
before it actually happens.

18:26.892 --> 18:29.061
OK. And another thing...

18:29.061 --> 18:30.771
Yes? CIA's got a new boss.

18:30.771 --> 18:32.106
How does that affect us?

18:32.106 --> 18:35.568
He wants to draw a line under
the excesses of the last ten years.

18:35.568 --> 18:38.864
Which ones? Private contractors
ripping off the American public.

18:38.864 --> 18:40.282
And that's been bad news

18:40.282 --> 18:42.951
for a couple of
the Prime Minister's friends.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.538
Tell me one thing.

18:47.706 --> 18:50.835
Is Johnny Worricker
mixed up in this?

18:50.835 --> 18:53.671
Of course.
And is he still on the loose?

18:53.671 --> 18:58.343
He's in Germany.
He was in Switzerland, with a...
former intelligence officer.

18:58.343 --> 18:59.552
A woman?

18:59.552 --> 19:02.013
We have real hopes of
bringing them home. Soon?

19:02.013 --> 19:05.184
Very. Nearly had them this morning.
An agent was out running.

19:05.184 --> 19:07.728
But? We lost them.

19:07.728 --> 19:09.063
How?

19:09.063 --> 19:11.315
Incompetence.

19:11.315 --> 19:16.738
So, meanwhile, you're offering me
an inside track?

19:16.738 --> 19:19.074
You have it.
For what reason?

19:19.074 --> 19:24.287
For the obvious reason. Because
you're Beasley's natural successor.

19:24.287 --> 19:26.915
Hardly. Not at the moment I'm not.

19:26.915 --> 19:28.917
Not while my husband's all over
the papers.

19:34.841 --> 19:36.300
We can deal with that.

19:38.386 --> 19:40.346
You can deal with the British
press in full cry?

19:40.346 --> 19:42.140
I don't see why not.

19:42.140 --> 19:45.268
At MI5 we've never had any
problem with the press.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.687
Really?

19:46.687 --> 19:51.108
Politics is fair game,
national security isn't.

19:51.108 --> 19:54.028
They're like all bullies,
they don't like being bullied back.

19:55.112 --> 20:01.494
My whole point ` the closer you get
to us, the easier your life will be.

20:11.880 --> 20:17.595
If I agree to this...
channel, what's going to happen?

20:17.595 --> 20:19.639
I'm going to call you
and we're going to meet.

20:19.639 --> 20:21.099
Where?

20:21.099 --> 20:24.144
In this room. When?
Whenever we need to.

20:27.898 --> 20:31.527
One thing, do your colleagues know
what you're doing?

20:31.527 --> 20:34.780
No. Do yours?

20:52.633 --> 20:56.470
Here, I got you these.
Herrings. The ones you like.

20:56.470 --> 21:00.766
Your favourites. I'm going
to make a salad.

21:00.766 --> 21:04.854
OK. I'm going to go for a walk.

21:04.854 --> 21:09.442
After lunch? Yes. Do you want me to
come with you?

21:09.442 --> 21:12.112
Great idea, and double the risk?

21:12.112 --> 21:14.948
I got you this.
It's at the local museum.

21:14.948 --> 21:16.951
From Raphael to Dali.

21:16.951 --> 21:20.288
It started last month.
It's not too late to join.

21:20.288 --> 21:22.457
Aren't you interested?

21:22.457 --> 21:25.209
Of course I'm interested.
Well?

21:25.209 --> 21:29.256
I started one art class in Lausanne.
I started another in Heidelberg.

21:29.256 --> 21:31.717
I'm tired of starting things
I don't get to finish.

21:31.717 --> 21:33.510
Margot, we both know the rules.

21:33.510 --> 21:34.761
Keep our minds active.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.847
Exactly. Keep doing things.

21:40.351 --> 21:42.728
Oh, God is that your idea
of making a salad?

21:42.728 --> 21:44.272
Sorry.

21:44.272 --> 21:48.443
Here. Can't I send
you on a salad-making course?

21:49.819 --> 21:51.738
That'll keep your mind active.

21:56.452 --> 22:02.124
We can retire and grow lettuces
in Suffolk and you can practice.

22:02.124 --> 22:04.752
This is all an attempt to break us.
Think of it that way.

22:04.752 --> 22:07.964
We're feeling like prisoners,
that's how they want us to feel.

22:07.964 --> 22:13.053
And do we have to stay relentlessly
cheerful? All the time? Once or
twice can't we be moody?

22:13.053 --> 22:14.471
You can be moody.

22:16.014 --> 22:18.016
Gherkins. Another thing you like.

22:19.768 --> 22:23.105
"Essigurke speziell fur
Feinschmecker."

22:23.105 --> 22:25.650
I remember one thing about spying.

22:25.650 --> 22:27.443
What's that? What do you remember?

22:27.443 --> 22:30.029
What do I remember?
Spies work alone.

22:48.007 --> 22:49.342
PHONE RINGS

22:54.598 --> 23:00.771
Julianne? Yes? It's Margot.
Hey - where are you now?

23:00.771 --> 23:08.487
Don't tell me. Is everything
all right? Yes, it's fine.
I haven't heard from Dad for weeks.

23:08.487 --> 23:12.617
Well, no. He can't call you,
he's frightened. And I shouldn't.

23:12.617 --> 23:15.453
But I couldn't resist.
It's kind of you.

23:15.453 --> 23:18.457
Don't be silly.
I'm glad one of you cares.

23:18.457 --> 23:22.795
We both care. It's just
Johnny's in an impossible position.

23:22.795 --> 23:25.631
He's been in impossible positions
since the day I was born.

23:25.631 --> 23:27.800
He thrives on them.

23:29.468 --> 23:30.887
How big are you?

23:30.887 --> 23:33.264
I'm big.
I'm due in a couple of months.

23:33.264 --> 23:35.266
How's it going with Jez?

23:35.266 --> 23:39.438
Oh, day by day. Life with a DJ.

23:39.438 --> 23:40.731
Gets in when I'm getting up.

23:40.731 --> 23:42.900
Are you living together?

23:42.900 --> 23:45.527
Almost. Not quite.
Otherwise?

23:45.527 --> 23:47.238
I'm superstitious.

23:50.783 --> 23:55.705
I don't quite dare. But it does feel
like this time I fell on my feet.

23:55.705 --> 23:58.917
I just don't want to push it too
far.

23:58.917 --> 24:00.836
It's lovely to hear your voice,
Julianne.

24:04.840 --> 24:08.719
I'll call you again. I don't know
when but I will. Margot? Yes?

24:09.970 --> 24:11.555
Take care of yourself.

25:21.339 --> 25:25.385
What? Seen this? You
know who wrote it?

25:25.385 --> 25:29.640
I have this strange feeling, she's
been talking to our brothers in
Millbank.

25:29.640 --> 25:33.185
How do you know that?
I don't. I sense it. How?

25:33.185 --> 25:39.275
Because that's how she
came to us. From the BBC, remember?
She broke the Jake Pierpan story.

25:39.275 --> 25:41.444
That peacenik with
the drippy sister.

25:43.113 --> 25:46.783
Have you ever asked yourself why
the sainted Allegra got that story?

25:46.783 --> 25:50.037
Or, more interesting,
why did they give it to her?

25:50.037 --> 25:53.666
Maybe she's just a
virgin who got lucky.

25:53.666 --> 25:56.794
Yeah, right. I wonder,
would you take her out for a drink?

26:02.008 --> 26:04.928
If they're using us,
let's see if we can use them.

26:08.515 --> 26:09.891
All right, let's get going.

26:12.978 --> 26:15.856
Ted, one thing. The diary story.

26:15.856 --> 26:21.946
Scan the Internet to see if it
spreads. Do it yourself, no one's to
know.

26:21.946 --> 26:25.158
Yes, sir, I'm sorry, I
thought you said to ignore it.

26:25.158 --> 26:29.579
We are ignoring it.
I also want you to keep me informed.

26:42.385 --> 26:44.387
You're back. Nice walk?

26:44.387 --> 26:46.472
Yes. Sweet town, isn't it?

26:46.472 --> 26:47.932
Yeah. Very sweet.

26:47.932 --> 26:52.145
Bath, only in Germany
and more genteel.

26:52.145 --> 26:56.692
I didn't know what you wanted to
do this evening.
What do you want to do?

26:56.692 --> 26:59.737
You could go to a movie.
Do you want me to cook supper?

26:59.737 --> 27:02.740
You don't have to entertain me,
you know. Yeah, I know.

27:02.740 --> 27:05.743
I was two years in Belfast,
never spoke to a soul, remember?

27:05.743 --> 27:09.289
I'm perfectly happy being unhappy,
if you know what I mean.

27:11.416 --> 27:12.709
You're very unfair.

27:12.709 --> 27:14.628
Unfair. How?

27:14.628 --> 27:16.505
About my cooking. Oh.

27:16.505 --> 27:20.175
Years ago, remember?
I made you a carbonara.

27:20.175 --> 27:23.012
How could I forget?
You made me a Milanese.

27:23.012 --> 27:24.555
I'll make you another.

27:31.604 --> 27:33.982
They were good times.

27:33.982 --> 27:35.776
They are good times.

27:41.740 --> 27:47.789
When we move, we're going to move so
fast you're not going to believe it.

27:51.334 --> 27:52.961
Oh, I think I will.

28:19.323 --> 28:20.657
How kind, thank you.

28:22.910 --> 28:25.538
You're the first person in the
office even to admit I exist.

28:25.538 --> 28:28.374
It's a newspaper.
You'll get used to it.

28:28.374 --> 28:31.711
Yeah, but the
editor's something, isn't she?

28:31.711 --> 28:35.465
You only have power if
you don't give a bugger.
Belinda doesn't give a bugger.

28:35.465 --> 28:38.802
That's what makes her special.
When politicians ask her to lunch,
she doesn't go.

28:38.802 --> 28:42.055
Let's face it, you can only do a job
properly if you're not frightened to
lose it.

28:42.055 --> 28:45.351
Are you trying to tell me something?
No, I'm trying to ask you something.

28:45.351 --> 28:48.854
What? What are you asking?

28:48.854 --> 28:52.108
Whether you work for
the security services.

28:52.108 --> 28:54.360
Or whether your boyfriend does.

28:54.360 --> 28:55.570
If I have a boyfriend.

28:55.570 --> 28:57.113
Whether you've been planted on us.

28:57.113 --> 28:58.406
Is this a serious question?

28:58.406 --> 28:59.908
Like that story this morning.

28:59.908 --> 29:01.118
What about it?

29:01.118 --> 29:02.911
Where did you get it?

29:08.083 --> 29:12.255
It's not a bed thing, is it?
One of two possibilities.

29:12.255 --> 29:13.923
A bed thing or a family thing.

29:13.923 --> 29:15.967
I'm going to lay a thousand
to one its family.

29:15.967 --> 29:17.844
Why?

29:17.844 --> 29:21.807
Because when a journalist goes out
on a limb, it's always family. Daddy
works in intelligence, does he?

29:21.807 --> 29:23.558
No.

29:23.558 --> 29:26.520
Is he with the dumb ones in Millbank
or with the clever ones in Vauxhall?

29:26.520 --> 29:28.689
And I'm not out on a limb.

29:32.193 --> 29:34.404
What are you planning
to do with the story?

29:34.404 --> 29:35.947
I'm not sure. I haven't decided.

29:37.282 --> 29:39.743
You haven't decided?

29:39.743 --> 29:44.039
OK. You don't spell it out,
you leave it for the reader to

29:44.039 --> 29:47.000
join the dots, but you're implying
the Prime Minister takes money

29:47.000 --> 29:51.589
from dodgy businessmen who fall in
the sea in mysterious circumstances.

29:51.589 --> 29:52.965
And you haven't decided?

29:56.052 --> 29:57.470
What does the look mean?

29:57.470 --> 30:01.308
I'm trying to work out if you're
a great deal stupider than you
appear, or a great deal cleverer.

30:37.680 --> 30:40.475
MOBILE RINGS

30:43.311 --> 30:46.022
Hello? Allegra? Rollo.

30:46.022 --> 30:47.315
Are you at home? Yes.

30:47.315 --> 30:50.235
Go to your computer, you'll find
something which moves the story on.

30:50.235 --> 30:52.363
It'd be great if it could
go in tonight.

30:52.363 --> 30:54.198
Rollo... Yes?

30:54.198 --> 30:57.535
I'm getting frightened. People are
asking questions. What people?

30:57.535 --> 31:00.288
The editor sent a journalist to
take me out for a drink.

31:00.288 --> 31:03.541
That's great. That's exactly
what we want. Who did she send?
Freddy Lagarde.

31:03.541 --> 31:08.296
Oh, Freddy. Did he take your virtue?
For a Pinot Grigio?

31:08.296 --> 31:09.923
People have done it for less.

31:09.923 --> 31:12.426
One thing, get a new phone.

31:12.426 --> 31:17.390
As from this morning, your name is
out there. Always assume someone is
listening. And, Allegra? Yes?

31:17.390 --> 31:20.434
Hold your nerve. With luck, there's
going to be a lot more of this.

31:22.312 --> 31:24.147
You've endured weeks of headlines,

31:24.147 --> 31:27.400
do you really believe you can
hold on as Deputy Prime Minister?

31:27.400 --> 31:29.569
To be honest,
I see no reason I shouldn't.

31:29.569 --> 31:33.073
I stand up for my husband,
I don't stand in for him.

31:33.073 --> 31:35.743
Yes, but if he does appear in Kiev
on charges of bribing

31:35.743 --> 31:37.411
government officials...

31:37.411 --> 31:39.664
It's a very different
culture from our own.

31:39.664 --> 31:42.583
And, by the way,
if people do have questions of him,

31:42.583 --> 31:45.962
then I'm confident Bill's going to
have perfectly satisfactory answers.

31:45.962 --> 31:48.715
But can you be sure of that?

31:48.715 --> 31:51.551
Do you know, as a
matter of fact, I can.

32:36.642 --> 32:39.979
Well, I think this has been a very
worthwhile evening.

32:39.979 --> 32:42.648
It's good for the cabinet to meet
informally for a change.

32:42.648 --> 32:44.692
Kick some ideas around.

32:44.692 --> 32:47.236
We appreciate you coming in, Anthea.

32:47.236 --> 32:50.281
Things must be heavy on your plate.

32:50.281 --> 32:53.743
If things can be heavy on a plate.

32:53.743 --> 32:55.579
Full on my plate.

32:55.579 --> 32:56.872
Yes. Yes. Loaded.

32:59.458 --> 33:03.921
It has been an ordeal, hasn't it?
Yes. But you are bearing up.

33:07.508 --> 33:11.513
I wonder what you feel about that
item in the Independent this
morning, Prime Minister.

33:11.513 --> 33:16.017
What item was that? I don't think I
saw it, did I? Remind me.
You didn't see it, sir.

33:16.017 --> 33:19.730
You have time to read the
Independent, do you, Jock? Justice
must be very under-worked.

33:20.981 --> 33:22.399
It put up a red flag.

33:22.399 --> 33:25.569
I'm amazed no one in your office
picked up on it.

33:25.569 --> 33:26.946
Anthea, did you see it?

33:26.946 --> 33:29.365
No. I've no idea what
he is talking about.

33:29.365 --> 33:31.159
I'll tell you what it's about.

33:31.159 --> 33:36.039
It said some of the people financing
the Bridge have dubious backgrounds.

33:36.039 --> 33:39.376
Did it?
It seems to be implying they're
not above murdering each other.

33:41.503 --> 33:47.051
Well, that's the way the world is.
There's always someone who can't
wait to fling a bucket of mud.

33:47.051 --> 33:49.554
Get used to it.

33:50.721 --> 33:51.931
I'll take a look at it.

33:54.601 --> 33:56.061
Let's get out of here.

34:17.375 --> 34:20.670
Oh, err... Worricker?

35:06.011 --> 35:10.140
OK, this is going to be very simple.
The simpler we keep it the better.
It's not going to be difficult.

35:10.140 --> 35:13.227
It's going to suit me,
then, that's what you're saying.

35:13.227 --> 35:16.272
We pick up cars.
OK. From different cities.

35:16.272 --> 35:18.650
OK. This is your Europcar card.

35:18.650 --> 35:21.611
Thank you. This is a map with a
route, I've marked it.

35:21.611 --> 35:24.906
You return the car as designated.
Usual drill.

35:24.906 --> 35:26.575
Except this time we stay separate.

35:26.575 --> 35:27.951
Credit card. Passport.

35:27.951 --> 35:30.079
Ah... Excellent. Who am I this time?

35:31.914 --> 35:33.624
You're joking.

35:33.624 --> 35:36.252
I liked it. It made me laugh.

35:36.252 --> 35:37.670
And who are you? Cilla Black?

35:37.670 --> 35:39.130
You don't need to know.

35:43.468 --> 35:47.556
And, by the way, I've wanted to say
this but I haven't said it.
What haven't you said?

35:48.682 --> 35:53.562
I wanted to tell you, I minded it
when you looked at my phone.

35:53.562 --> 35:57.024
When you checked my calls.
I hated that.

36:00.737 --> 36:02.822
Well, then I won't be
doing that again.

36:07.077 --> 36:11.206
And also, just asking,
how was my daughter?

36:12.207 --> 36:15.503
Julianne? Julianne's fine.

36:23.178 --> 36:24.471
You're up.

36:25.472 --> 36:28.517
Mm hm. Yeah. Are you OK?

36:28.517 --> 36:29.810
I'm fine.

36:50.540 --> 36:55.629
I was just reading this stuff about
Beasley. What a dag.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.843
Dag? Yeah. Dag's the stuff that
hangs off the end of a sheep.

37:00.843 --> 37:04.222
You like him that much? I just don't
like people who invent threats

37:04.222 --> 37:07.767
to justify doing what they wanted to
do all along.

37:07.767 --> 37:10.103
Look at that face. He looks like a
Russian mobster.

37:10.103 --> 37:13.690
You don't think this
country's under threat?

37:13.690 --> 37:16.443
On the contrary. It's because I take
real threats seriously

37:16.443 --> 37:18.779
that I don't want to be blackmailed
by phony ones.

37:20.656 --> 37:23.326
Politicians who cry wolf are
the most dangerous kind.

37:26.204 --> 37:28.415
I'm interested,
how can you know so much about it?

37:30.041 --> 37:33.503
I'm interested. How can you not?

37:35.339 --> 37:39.385
Sometimes I feel I really don't
know anything about you.

37:40.511 --> 37:42.930
Don't you? No. No I don't.

37:44.473 --> 37:45.933
But I'd like to.

37:51.106 --> 37:53.775
Well, you'll
have plenty of time to find out.

38:35.821 --> 38:37.447
Here is the phone.

38:39.157 --> 38:40.492
Danke.

38:46.499 --> 38:47.875
Good luck.

38:50.837 --> 38:53.465
PHONE RINGS

38:56.009 --> 38:57.886
I hope you're moving.

38:57.886 --> 39:00.722
We are. I just said goodbye to her.
Good.

39:00.722 --> 39:03.976
As a matter of interest, who told
you today was the day to get going?

39:03.976 --> 39:06.896
Because, believe it or not,
I still have some friends.

39:06.896 --> 39:08.147
I'm amazed.

39:08.147 --> 39:09.690
Johnny, you'd be even more amazed

39:09.690 --> 39:12.276
if you knew how many people
in Millbank are rooting for you.

39:36.177 --> 39:38.972
Good afternoon.
I believe you may have a car for me.

39:38.972 --> 39:40.557
Do you speak English? We do.

39:40.557 --> 39:42.309
My German is rusty.

39:46.146 --> 39:47.856
Marsden? OK.

39:47.856 --> 39:49.775
Gerry Marsden.

40:10.589 --> 40:11.882
Do you mind?

40:18.723 --> 40:21.017
I guessed you were English.

40:21.017 --> 40:23.937
Where are you going?
You don't mind me asking? Erm...

40:23.937 --> 40:27.107
back to school. I'm a teacher.

40:27.107 --> 40:29.026
Where? Where?

40:29.026 --> 40:30.986
I was asking, where do you teach?

40:30.986 --> 40:34.448
I'm sorry...I'm tired.

40:34.448 --> 40:35.867
I need to sleep.

40:47.170 --> 40:48.881
SHIP'S HORN BLARES

40:57.181 --> 40:58.516
You're well loaded up.

41:00.810 --> 41:03.355
Isn't that what the continent's for?

41:03.355 --> 41:05.690
CHUCKLES: We all love
a booze cruise.

41:05.690 --> 41:08.026
FANS CHANT: ..the Arsenal,

41:08.026 --> 41:11.572
unto victory, yeah!

41:11.572 --> 41:14.825
We all follow the Arsenal! Over...

41:43.022 --> 41:44.232
Thank you

41:46.693 --> 41:49.029
Miss Springfield.

41:49.029 --> 41:50.113
Thank you

42:02.919 --> 42:05.588
Ah, you must be Belinda Kay.
Yes, I am.

42:05.588 --> 42:08.550
How kind of you to see me.
How are you?

42:08.550 --> 42:09.759
And who are you?

42:09.759 --> 42:12.346
I'm the man who telephoned.

42:12.346 --> 42:13.680
Yes, of course you are.

42:19.353 --> 42:21.689
24 bottles of wine.

42:21.689 --> 42:23.983
Thank you. How thoughtful.

42:23.983 --> 42:26.528
Because I'm a journalist
I must be alcoholic?

42:26.528 --> 42:28.363
You've come from abroad?

42:28.363 --> 42:30.991
Erm...I hope you like Bourgueil.

42:30.991 --> 42:33.243
Well, aren't you the welcome guest?

42:39.500 --> 42:41.043
Come this way.

42:43.129 --> 42:45.298
Goodness, this is quite imposing.

42:48.843 --> 42:51.471
Hey! Hey.

42:51.471 --> 42:52.806
This is Barry.

42:52.806 --> 42:55.434
He's my boyfriend,
or some such thing...

42:55.434 --> 42:56.810
Hi. Barry.

42:56.810 --> 42:58.228
I was just making some tea.

42:58.228 --> 43:00.189
You're going to have to hop it.

43:00.189 --> 43:02.066
Sorry? This is confidential.

43:04.819 --> 43:06.529
Hop it!

43:06.529 --> 43:09.073
You never saw this man.

43:09.073 --> 43:11.242
He doesn't exist.

43:11.242 --> 43:13.161
He's none too bright.

43:14.496 --> 43:17.916
Come through.
Or perhaps you'd prefer whisky.

43:17.916 --> 43:20.961
Not right now, I need a clear head.

43:20.961 --> 43:23.297
Look, first of all I want
to thank you

43:23.297 --> 43:25.216
for all your paper's done already.

43:25.216 --> 43:26.717
It's been a wonderful job.

43:36.603 --> 43:39.189
Do you know how lonely that
makes an editor feel?

43:39.189 --> 43:41.316
You run a story
and no-one else touches it.

43:41.316 --> 43:43.444
I'm hoping we can change that.

43:43.444 --> 43:45.655
People have low expectations.

43:45.655 --> 43:49.283
You'd be surprised - Beasley's
feathering his nest, so what?

43:49.283 --> 43:51.578
He's got disreputable friends. So?

43:51.578 --> 43:53.121
He's a politician.

43:53.121 --> 43:57.250
I'm hoping to make the story
a little more specific than that.

43:57.250 --> 43:59.544
A newspaper's not a blog, you know.
I know that.

43:59.544 --> 44:03.382
It's not just whatever you think, or
whatever anyone happens to tell you.

44:03.382 --> 44:05.050
There are editorial protocols.

44:05.050 --> 44:06.385
Have you ever heard of them?

44:06.385 --> 44:08.221
Of course.
I'm hoping to satisfy those.

44:08.221 --> 44:11.265
And somehow you're going to do that
without telling me your name?

44:11.265 --> 44:12.475
Unlikely.

44:14.561 --> 44:16.062
The girl's a plant, isn't she?

44:16.062 --> 44:18.565
No, I don't think so.
If you mean Allegra.

44:18.565 --> 44:20.776
The one with the damask cheek.

44:20.776 --> 44:22.945
She of the butter-wouldn't-melt
brigade.

44:22.945 --> 44:26.115
Allegra isn't a plant,
she's a conduit.

44:26.115 --> 44:29.493
As a matter of fact, she's
the niece of a colleague of mine.

44:29.493 --> 44:31.537
Well, there you are.

44:31.537 --> 44:33.289
That's England, one big family.

44:33.289 --> 44:37.085
And I suppose now she's served her
purpose it's time to move on to me.

44:38.670 --> 44:40.213
All right, go ahead.

44:41.423 --> 44:43.300
Make your pitch.

44:43.300 --> 44:44.968
OK.

44:46.679 --> 44:52.310
I don't know much you know about
Britain's intelligence service...

44:52.310 --> 44:54.145
Funny.

44:54.145 --> 44:56.564
I had a feeling
you might start there.

44:56.564 --> 45:00.402
Well, the last ten years have
been kind of bumpy.

45:00.402 --> 45:03.280
It used to be very
clear who the enemy was.

45:03.280 --> 45:05.449
And so also it was
clear what the job was.

45:05.449 --> 45:07.868
And then? And then we got caught
out.

45:07.868 --> 45:10.246
Trouble came from
an unexpected direction.

45:10.246 --> 45:12.832
Or rather it started
coming from every direction.

45:12.832 --> 45:16.628
Suddenly we were told we were meant
to be fighting a worldwide movement.

45:16.628 --> 45:18.129
And weren't you?

45:18.129 --> 45:20.799
Let's just say we got a bit
careless about distinguishing

45:20.799 --> 45:23.552
between people who would like to
do terrible things

45:23.552 --> 45:25.345
and people who were
actually doing them.

45:25.345 --> 45:28.015
We became indiscriminate
about the methods we used.

45:28.015 --> 45:32.603
It was dog eat dog.
The only problem is, we're not dogs.

45:32.603 --> 45:35.356
Is "indiscriminate methods"
a euphemism for torture?

45:35.356 --> 45:37.025
Torture's just part of an apparatus.

45:37.025 --> 45:40.862
An apparatus of bad practice,
which is out of control

45:40.862 --> 45:45.450
and which I don't believe is helping
anyone, least of all us.

45:45.450 --> 45:49.079
Meanwhile, politicians
want to cut corners. Sure.

45:49.079 --> 45:51.999
Alec Beasley's been trying to
reorganise the service.

45:51.999 --> 45:54.126
Reorganise it? And bypass it.

45:54.126 --> 45:55.294
His mind's made up

45:55.294 --> 45:58.423
and the facts don't bother him.
Well that's his right, isn't it?

45:58.423 --> 46:00.967
After all, he won a couple of
elections. He certainly did.

46:00.967 --> 46:05.722
Because people like his strength.
He has a mandate. That is democracy.

46:05.722 --> 46:08.350
And, speaking for myself,
I have a great deal more faith

46:08.350 --> 46:12.479
in someone I've elected than some
disgruntled intelligence officer -

46:12.479 --> 46:15.232
I'm assuming that's what you are -
who arrives at my house

46:15.232 --> 46:18.027
with two cases of wine
and an outsized grievance.

46:18.027 --> 46:22.782
I'm too young, but you may remember
a prime minister called Harold
Wilson.

46:22.782 --> 46:24.242
I do remember him.

46:24.242 --> 46:26.703
Didn't the security services spend
a great deal of effort

46:26.703 --> 46:28.080
trying to get rid of him?

46:28.080 --> 46:29.873
I don't think that's ever
been proved.

46:29.873 --> 46:33.002
I didn't ask if it was proved,
I asked if it were true.

46:33.002 --> 46:35.796
And I'm not trying to get
rid of Beasley. Aren't you?

46:35.796 --> 46:38.466
No. I'm trying to put
the facts in front of the public.

46:40.385 --> 46:44.097
You're a very plausible fellow,
aren't you, whatever your name is.

46:44.097 --> 46:47.058
Remember, I'm a rat-catcher myself.
It takes one to know one.

46:47.058 --> 46:49.728
And everything you say stinks
to high heaven.

46:50.938 --> 46:52.106
Tell me why.

46:52.106 --> 46:55.025
No editor likes to be used.

46:55.025 --> 46:58.070
You may be burning to bring
down a prime minister, but I'm not.

46:58.070 --> 47:00.198
That's not my intention.
All I'm trying to do

47:00.198 --> 47:03.159
is throw a little light
on some of his activities.

47:03.159 --> 47:05.745
Oh, I see, this is assisted killing,
is it?

47:05.745 --> 47:09.207
You put the pill in the hand
but you don't put it in the mouth.

47:09.207 --> 47:10.542
No. You leave that to us.

47:10.542 --> 47:12.753
I mean, just one more question -

47:12.753 --> 47:16.215
aren't you rather over-stretching
your remit? I don't think so.

47:16.215 --> 47:18.884
I thought you were meant to gather
secrets, not give them away.

47:18.884 --> 47:21.888
So far, I don't remember giving
you any secrets. I thought you did.

47:21.888 --> 47:25.058
No. Everything you've been told has
been on the public record. Truly?

47:25.058 --> 47:27.185
Only, just like most
newspapers nowadays,

47:27.185 --> 47:30.063
you've lacked the diligence
to go out and find it.

47:31.398 --> 47:32.983
Or maybe the motivation?

47:37.863 --> 47:39.949
All right, these are the facts.

47:39.949 --> 47:42.243
Great. Let's hear them.

47:42.243 --> 47:45.997
The Prime Minister is linked to
a series of interlocking charities

47:45.997 --> 47:49.417
which are partly financed by a firm
called Gladstone.

47:50.877 --> 47:54.798
Gladstone has built an international
complex of detention camps

47:54.798 --> 47:56.425
which don't officially exist

47:56.425 --> 47:59.178
and for which they've therefore
been able to overcharge.

47:59.178 --> 48:00.888
Now you're telling me something new.

48:00.888 --> 48:03.558
The American government
has put pressure on them

48:03.558 --> 48:06.060
to get some of its money back.
A great deal of pressure.

48:06.060 --> 48:07.562
And have they succeeded?

48:08.730 --> 48:10.899
That's something you're going
to have to look into.

48:12.567 --> 48:14.736
OK.

48:14.736 --> 48:17.322
That's an interesting story,
I'm sure we'll want to cover it.

48:17.322 --> 48:18.949
We all love laughing at the Yanks,

48:18.949 --> 48:21.744
but I still don't see how that
reflects on Alec Beasley. Don't you?

48:21.744 --> 48:22.912
No.

48:25.456 --> 48:26.874
I'll tell you.

48:26.874 --> 48:30.044
But if I do,
I'll be crossing a line.

48:30.044 --> 48:33.256
What sort of line? The secret line.

48:33.256 --> 48:35.926
I need to know
you're at peace with that.

48:35.926 --> 48:39.304
Shouldn't that question be
directed at you?

48:39.304 --> 48:41.015
Very well.

48:41.015 --> 48:43.100
It's going to be hard to unpick,

48:43.100 --> 48:45.728
because Beasley's affairs
are tangled up in companies

48:45.728 --> 48:47.605
owned by Stirling Rogers.

48:49.357 --> 48:51.609
But I can promise you,

48:51.609 --> 48:55.071
somewhere there's a paper trail
which leads directly back

48:55.071 --> 48:58.075
from the building of the camps
to the Prime Minister's

48:58.075 --> 49:00.953
own personal finances.

49:03.789 --> 49:05.332
Really?

49:05.332 --> 49:06.667
Yeah.

49:18.096 --> 49:19.765
I wonder...

49:21.809 --> 49:24.603
Would you be interested
in staying to eat?

49:31.069 --> 49:32.403
Miss Tankard?

49:32.403 --> 49:34.197
Yes?

49:34.197 --> 49:38.201
It's Amber Page. We've got Margot.

49:38.201 --> 49:41.038
How? Luck. Pure luck.

49:41.038 --> 49:43.665
One of our people
got on a train at Frankfurt.

49:43.665 --> 49:46.460
He was on holiday,
he wasn't even working.

49:46.460 --> 49:50.214
Listen, here's the good news -
she's heading home.

49:50.214 --> 49:51.507
Where is she?

49:51.507 --> 49:54.510
She's getting in
at Stansted from Paris.

49:54.510 --> 49:57.055
We've got people waiting?
They're in place.

49:57.055 --> 49:59.224
And him? No. He's not with her.

49:59.224 --> 50:01.101
But it's all right.

50:01.101 --> 50:04.688
One thing I can promise is he won't
be without her for very long.

50:15.199 --> 50:18.119
I'm alone. I haven't got long.
Julianne's forgotten her phone.

50:18.119 --> 50:20.455
'And?' You remember that call?
The one from Margot?

Of course. Last week. That's it.

50:23.542 --> 50:26.920
Yes, the office has broken it.
You've got Margot's number? We do.

50:26.920 --> 50:31.467

got Margot Tyrell in person.

50:53.741 --> 50:58.538
Ah good,
welcome to Barry's running buffet.

50:58.538 --> 51:00.081
He's perfect, isn't he?

51:00.081 --> 51:02.167
Heaven to live with.
We lack for nothing.

51:02.167 --> 51:04.127
Thank you, Barry.

51:04.127 --> 51:05.253
My pleasure.

51:05.253 --> 51:08.048
I'm afraid you're going to have
to leave us again.

51:09.049 --> 51:11.051
The coriander goes with the chicken

51:11.051 --> 51:13.387
and the dressing
goes with the rocket.

51:13.387 --> 51:15.389
Don't worry, we'll manage.

51:15.389 --> 51:16.474
Enjoy!

51:21.104 --> 51:22.272
You have everything.

51:31.365 --> 51:32.449
And you?

51:33.784 --> 51:36.287
Friends and family?

51:42.836 --> 51:46.047
None of my business,
but you seem rather sad.

51:47.382 --> 51:50.469
I'm not sad. It's just...

51:50.469 --> 51:53.931
I suppose I was doing a job I loved
and now it's been taken away.

51:53.931 --> 51:56.392
You're an editor,
I imagine it's pretty good fun.

51:56.392 --> 51:57.435
And you were a spy.

51:59.103 --> 52:00.396
Correct.

52:01.606 --> 52:05.986
And you're wondering,
"If I'm not a spy...

52:05.986 --> 52:07.821
"then what am I?"

52:12.367 --> 52:14.995
Shall we get back
to the matter in hand?

52:19.917 --> 52:23.630
There's a rule of thumb
with this kind of campaign.

52:23.630 --> 52:28.176
What do they say? "It's never
the crime, it's the cover-up."

52:28.176 --> 52:30.887
Well, there isn't a cover-up yet.
We haven't got that far.

52:30.887 --> 52:33.015
Right,
so we have to force him into one.

52:33.015 --> 52:35.476
We have to ask him questions
which he can't answer.

52:35.476 --> 52:37.561
Do you know
what those questions are?

52:37.561 --> 52:39.146
The other rule is, as you say,

52:39.146 --> 52:42.525
a campaign isn't a campaign if it's
only been picked up by one paper.

52:42.525 --> 52:45.069
No-one else is going to touch it
until they have to.

52:45.069 --> 52:48.281
Well, then we'd better make sure
the questions are good.

53:31.369 --> 53:33.246
Thanks, guys.

54:45.574 --> 54:47.284
You ARE good at this.

54:47.284 --> 54:48.536
Thank you.

54:50.788 --> 54:52.248
Why don't you have a jacket?

54:52.248 --> 54:54.918
Obviously cos I'm not as good
as you are. Where are we going?

54:54.918 --> 54:56.336
To a safe house.

55:11.477 --> 55:12.687
Good afternoon.

55:14.606 --> 55:17.233
I'm an old friend of Johnny's.

55:17.233 --> 55:19.027
How nice to meet you.

55:19.027 --> 55:20.654
We were at Cambridge together.

55:20.654 --> 55:21.947
Goodness.

55:21.947 --> 55:24.741
Yes. Oh, yes. Johnny was
a very real loss to theology.

55:24.741 --> 55:27.161
Can I leave her in your hands,
Padre? Of course you can.

55:27.161 --> 55:29.038
Sorry, but I've to get back to work.

55:29.038 --> 55:30.373
Talk soon.

55:42.177 --> 55:44.513
It's the Church's
traditional function.

55:44.513 --> 55:48.350
The thing we've done best
for two thousand years -

55:48.350 --> 55:49.977
provide sanctuary.

It's a celebration.

56:13.753 --> 56:15.004
That I can see.

56:15.004 --> 56:18.591
We've been told tomorrow
the charges are going to be dropped.

56:18.591 --> 56:20.218
Dropped?

56:21.636 --> 56:23.513
All of them?

56:23.513 --> 56:25.682
The Ukrainian court has decided

56:25.682 --> 56:28.769
it's not in the public interest
to proceed.

56:28.769 --> 56:31.855
Meaning what?
Meaning someone's done a deal?

56:31.855 --> 56:33.232
I guess.

56:33.232 --> 56:36.027
What sort of deal? A trade deal?

56:36.027 --> 56:38.529
What sort of trade?
What is it always?

56:40.365 --> 56:43.368
Weapons, of course. Arms.

56:43.368 --> 56:45.036
It's always arms.

56:46.455 --> 56:49.666
With one bound I'm free.

Yes, of course.

You know what's happening to Bill?

57:41.097 --> 57:43.808
I told you, didn't I?
Stick close to us.

57:43.808 --> 57:47.437
'I need to be clear.
Is this your doing?'

57:47.437 --> 57:49.940
Anthea, can I say something?

57:49.940 --> 57:52.901
It's one thing to go around
saying what you want.

57:52.901 --> 57:56.447
The test comes when you're actually
given the chance to get it.

57:56.447 --> 57:58.073
'That's when you're tested.'

57:59.325 --> 58:02.078
When they wanted to get rid
of Margaret Thatcher,

58:02.078 --> 58:05.665
John Major got toothache so he
didn't have to answer his phone.

58:05.665 --> 58:08.460
A week later, he was Prime Minister.

58:08.460 --> 58:10.003
How are your teeth?

58:13.507 --> 58:15.342
Just beginning to ache.

58:16.677 --> 58:18.178
Good. I'm glad to hear it.

SHE SIGHS

58:33.653 --> 58:35.697
You see him often?

58:35.697 --> 58:37.616
Hmm, when he's in trouble.

58:37.616 --> 58:39.577
But you know how Johnny is.

58:39.577 --> 58:42.079
Once you're his friend,
you're his friend for ever.

58:42.079 --> 58:46.167
He's loyal, above all things.
But you know that.

58:47.627 --> 58:50.213
Yes. We were together a long time.

58:51.881 --> 58:53.425
He wasn't threatened by me.

58:54.634 --> 58:57.221
The stronger I was,
the more he liked it.

58:58.722 --> 59:00.516
That's rare.

59:00.516 --> 59:01.517
Good for him.

59:05.438 --> 59:07.023
You know him well?

59:07.023 --> 59:09.651
I helped him
through some difficult days.

59:09.651 --> 59:14.739
When he was a student,
he loved the idea of faith.

59:14.739 --> 59:16.199
The life of the church.

59:17.868 --> 59:21.580
So someone had to point out
that he didn't actually believe.

59:22.790 --> 59:24.583
And that was you?

59:24.583 --> 59:26.586
Hm.

59:26.586 --> 59:28.671
And he didn't?

59:28.671 --> 59:33.176
No. He wanted to.
More than anything.

59:35.220 --> 59:37.389
But, sadly, that's not
the same thing.

59:51.404 --> 59:54.574
Thank you.
No, thank you.

01:01:14.911 --> 01:01:17.330
Come on, Stirling.
Your backhand's normally terrific.

01:01:17.330 --> 01:01:19.833
What the hell's going on?
My mind's elsewhere, sorry.

01:01:19.833 --> 01:01:22.711
I need you to give me a game.
Do you want to play properly?

01:01:22.711 --> 01:01:26.840
Cos if you don't play properly
there's no point in playing.

01:01:34.056 --> 01:01:36.809
Oh, come on, Stirling,
you can do better than that.

01:01:59.751 --> 01:02:01.503
All right, you know what this is.

01:02:01.503 --> 01:02:03.546
No, I don't.
You bloody well do!

01:02:03.546 --> 01:02:06.091
Ah...it's that again, is it?
I've reached a decision.

01:02:09.177 --> 01:02:11.221
Alec, I'm roadkill.

01:02:11.221 --> 01:02:13.474
I don't mean a thing.
Lose me, you lose nothing.

01:02:13.474 --> 01:02:16.769
Think, the press are after us.
It's only a question of time.

01:02:16.769 --> 01:02:19.105
So I issue a statement...
No.

01:02:19.105 --> 01:02:21.983
It's simple, "Everything I've done,
I've done in good faith.

01:02:21.983 --> 01:02:23.818
"My only interest has been
in safeguarding

01:02:23.818 --> 01:02:26.404
"the Prime Minister's legacy."
Stirling, no!

01:02:26.404 --> 01:02:30.367
However, unknown to you -
and this is the crucial part -

01:02:30.367 --> 01:02:34.622
unknown to you, "I took money
from certain people in the States."

01:02:34.622 --> 01:02:37.416
No...
But why not? It's a clean cut.

01:02:37.416 --> 01:02:39.418
You know what it sounds like.
Unknown to me

01:02:39.418 --> 01:02:41.963
you took dodgy money and I'm
so stupid I didn't even know.

01:02:41.963 --> 01:02:44.215
Alec, you know where this is going.
No, I don't.

01:02:44.215 --> 01:02:47.260
It's going where every
political scandal always goes.

01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:49.888
The press doesn't give a fuck
about the issues,

01:02:49.888 --> 01:02:52.516
they just want a kill.
Clearly.

01:02:52.516 --> 01:02:55.477
Well, here I am.
I'm offering myself.

01:02:55.477 --> 01:02:59.482
No. And for one very good reason -
if I go, the screaming's over.

01:02:59.482 --> 01:03:01.484
But it doesn't work like that.

01:03:01.484 --> 01:03:02.819
Then how does it work?

01:03:02.819 --> 01:03:05.488
If you give them fresh blood
then they always want more.

01:03:05.488 --> 01:03:07.949
Now, a week ago you told me
this wasn't important.

01:03:07.949 --> 01:03:11.995
A week ago it wasn't! Well!

01:03:11.995 --> 01:03:15.791
Jesus! Everything I do
I do for my country.

01:03:15.791 --> 01:03:18.335
Oh, and that makes it all right?

01:03:18.335 --> 01:03:20.463
What did you say?

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.423
Nothing.

01:03:22.423 --> 01:03:25.093
Stirling, are you going weak on me?
No.

01:03:25.093 --> 01:03:27.262
Are you going soft?
No.

01:03:27.262 --> 01:03:29.639
I'm the only person who takes
this threat seriously.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:32.517
I take it seriously. If you saw
the files, if you saw the evidence,

01:03:32.517 --> 01:03:34.811
I can't show you the stuff
that I am seeing,

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.399
but the intelligence is frightening,
it is!

01:03:38.399 --> 01:03:40.943
And people have a choice -
help me, or help them.

01:03:40.943 --> 01:03:43.988
And now we're being told,
keep our hands tied behind our backs

01:03:43.988 --> 01:03:45.698
while they kick our lights out!

01:03:45.698 --> 01:03:47.533
"Stick to the rules."

01:03:47.533 --> 01:03:49.911
Bring on the lawyers,
is that what you want?

01:03:49.911 --> 01:03:52.414
No. What I want is for you
to survive.

01:03:52.414 --> 01:03:55.709
I want you to be Prime Minister
at this time next week.

01:03:55.709 --> 01:03:56.919
That's what I want.

01:03:58.295 --> 01:04:00.798
No, they won't get me.
I'm ahead of them.

01:04:00.798 --> 01:04:02.925
Always have been.
Always will be.

01:04:06.888 --> 01:04:08.681
I'm sorry, sir.
You really are needed.

01:04:10.141 --> 01:04:12.727
That's the whole point, do you see?
They want both things.

01:04:12.727 --> 01:04:17.065
Like children. They need me
and they resent me. Both things.

01:04:17.065 --> 01:04:19.276
Before you do anything,
speak to me first.

01:04:21.528 --> 01:04:23.030
Ted...

01:04:29.579 --> 01:04:33.416

everyone knows what's going on.

01:04:33.416 --> 01:04:37.170
'For days now, the Prime Minister
has been evading our questions.

01:04:37.170 --> 01:04:40.215
'We have to conclude he is not
answering because he can't.

01:04:40.215 --> 01:04:43.552
'There are five questions
we have asked the Prime Minister

01:04:43.552 --> 01:04:44.970
'that he has to answer.

01:04:44.970 --> 01:04:48.724
'If he can't answer them, he should
say so, and he should say so now.

'If he can

01:04:51.644 --> 01:04:54.689

DOOR OPENS

01:05:20.634 --> 01:05:22.553
So...what do you think?

01:05:22.553 --> 01:05:24.763
He's wounded.
Fatally?

01:05:24.763 --> 01:05:27.183
Have you seen the five questions?
I have.

01:05:28.434 --> 01:05:30.811
"Has the Prime Minister met with
Church and Bethwaite?

01:05:30.811 --> 01:05:33.231
"Did the Prime Minister know
the murdered man?

01:05:33.231 --> 01:05:36.693
"Did the Prime Minister know
of their donations to the Bridge?

01:05:36.693 --> 01:05:38.945
"Was the Prime Minister aware
of a network of

01:05:38.945 --> 01:05:42.157
"illegal detention centres
built by Gladstone?

01:05:42.157 --> 01:05:46.829
"Has the Prime Minister benefited
personally from Gladstone?"

01:05:46.829 --> 01:05:48.706
They're not bad questions.

01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:52.585
Has he said anything?
In private? In cabinet?

01:05:52.585 --> 01:05:55.713
He's refusing, on the grounds
of national security.

01:05:55.713 --> 01:05:59.676
Ha! It's not going to wash.
Are you sure?

01:05:59.676 --> 01:06:01.803
Certain. I've known from the start.

01:06:01.803 --> 01:06:03.805
From the minute
I first saw the evidence.

01:06:05.140 --> 01:06:09.603
Hm. I am going to have to rally
round him. Publicly.

01:06:09.603 --> 01:06:12.690
If you feel it's necessary.
I do. Very much so.

01:06:12.690 --> 01:06:14.859
Be careful.
Careful of what?

01:06:14.859 --> 01:06:16.736
Your own future.
Meaning?

01:06:16.736 --> 01:06:19.447
Hostages to fortune.
How everything will look in a week.

01:06:25.662 --> 01:06:27.080
How's Bill?

01:06:29.083 --> 01:06:31.460
He's fine.

01:06:31.460 --> 01:06:34.088
You're not going to divorce?

01:06:34.088 --> 01:06:37.342
I'm not. Not yet.

01:06:37.342 --> 01:06:39.135
Good. You shouldn't.

01:06:39.135 --> 01:06:40.637
I won't.

01:06:40.637 --> 01:06:42.138
Good.

01:06:42.138 --> 01:06:43.431
Why do you ask?

01:06:45.475 --> 01:06:48.771
What's that phrase about
getting your ducks in a row?

01:06:52.316 --> 01:06:54.110
I-I'll take one more question.

01:06:54.110 --> 01:06:56.654
I hope I have already made
everything clear.

01:06:56.654 --> 01:07:00.074
I have returned all money received
from Gladstone and I have personally

01:07:00.074 --> 01:07:04.162
resigned from the foundation
to leave its reputation unharmed.

01:07:04.162 --> 01:07:09.751
At all times, Alec Beasley has been
separated from the day-to-day

01:07:09.751 --> 01:07:11.962
activities... No. ..of The Bridge

01:07:11.962 --> 01:07:14.548
and any criticism regarding
funding falls on me alone.

01:07:14.548 --> 01:07:16.801
He shouldn't have done it.
He didn't need to.

01:07:16.801 --> 01:07:19.011
He said he was going to
talk to me first.

01:07:19.011 --> 01:07:21.222
Perhaps he found the pressure
unbearable.

01:07:21.222 --> 01:07:24.935
Pressure? Pressure is like whiplash,
it doesn't exist.

01:07:29.815 --> 01:07:33.819
'I'm not in any way admitting
liability or even error.

01:07:33.819 --> 01:07:36.739
'I want to be clear about that.
On the other hand...'

01:07:40.993 --> 01:07:42.495
I've made my decision.

01:07:48.543 --> 01:07:50.712
We still need to find Worricker.

01:07:50.712 --> 01:07:52.840
Until we find him,
we're not out of this yet.

01:07:59.263 --> 01:08:00.306

It's quiet, yes.

01:08:08.857 --> 01:08:11.777
Can we turn on the news?
We heard it an hour ago.

01:08:11.777 --> 01:08:14.238
So?

01:08:14.238 --> 01:08:16.240
I wouldn't do that.

01:08:16.240 --> 01:08:18.783
Why not?
It's the road to destruction.

01:08:20.453 --> 01:08:21.787
Gosh. Hm.

01:08:25.124 --> 01:08:27.711
You always look out for me.

01:08:27.711 --> 01:08:29.421
Always.

01:08:29.421 --> 01:08:32.631
Where's Bernard?
He's saying Matins.

01:08:32.631 --> 01:08:34.801
Oh, no doubt alone.

01:08:34.801 --> 01:08:36.553
He doesn't mind.
He's talking to God.

01:08:36.553 --> 01:08:38.721
He doesn't care
if anyone's listening.

01:08:39.890 --> 01:08:41.767
Why are you smiling?

01:08:44.812 --> 01:08:47.982
I know you better than
anyone knows you, Johnny.

01:08:47.982 --> 01:08:51.736
I know where you're heading.
I can see your endgame.

01:08:55.698 --> 01:08:59.078
He's gone. Who's gone?
Stirling Rogers. Rogers has gone.
What happened?

01:08:59.078 --> 01:09:02.247
He's giving a press conference,
saying the whole thing's his fault.

01:09:02.247 --> 01:09:05.042
Better still, he's saying
the Prime Minister knew nothing.

01:09:05.042 --> 01:09:07.337
Yes! He's walking into the trap,
it appears.

01:09:07.337 --> 01:09:10.548
You trust it? You think
we've got him? Let's hope so.

to go. Why not? You don't know
who it's from. It's Julianne.

01:09:15.970 --> 01:09:19.308
It's not safe, leave it, we should
have destroyed it! Margot?
Yes, it's me.

01:09:19.308 --> 01:09:23.229
'I need to see you. Desperately.
Are you in the country?
Something terrible's happened.'

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:26.232
Julianne, is the baby all right?
'Yes, yes, but can you tell Dad'

01:09:26.232 --> 01:09:28.901
I need to see him?
Yes, of course I will.

01:09:28.901 --> 01:09:31.863
And he must call immediately
before you get here. Promise me.

01:09:31.863 --> 01:09:34.241
Don't worry. We're on our way.
See you soon.

01:09:37.743 --> 01:09:41.165
OK, we're in business,
it's good, I think we've got 'em.

01:09:41.165 --> 01:09:43.167
Where are they?
We've got a signal.

01:09:43.167 --> 01:09:46.295
I'll know more in a minute
but it seems to be Kent.

01:09:46.295 --> 01:09:49.006
Johnny, we have to go.
Julianne says it's serious...

01:09:49.006 --> 01:09:52.051
Hold on a minute, give me a time to
think... There is no time to think.

01:09:52.051 --> 01:09:54.095
She said, "Can you tell Dad
I need to see him?"

01:09:54.095 --> 01:09:56.848
Margot, we need to be careful.
Johnny, it's your daughter!

01:09:56.848 --> 01:09:59.309
I'm concerned that
the phone isn't safe!

01:09:59.309 --> 01:10:01.937
Oh, fuck the phone!
We can't go together!

01:10:01.937 --> 01:10:06.817
What difference does it make?
When Julianne calls, you go.
Do you have a problem with that?

01:10:06.817 --> 01:10:08.986
How long have you been
working on this?

01:10:08.986 --> 01:10:10.530
Four months.

01:10:10.530 --> 01:10:12.365
Just the four?
Exactly.

01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:16.953
OK, good, here we go.
Here is the location.

01:10:16.953 --> 01:10:18.705
Let's get going.

01:10:22.292 --> 01:10:26.922
I vehemently reject all allegations.
But, I don't understand,

01:10:26.922 --> 01:10:29.717
if you're innocent of everything,
why do you have to resign?

01:10:29.717 --> 01:10:31.844
LAUGHTER

01:10:31.844 --> 01:10:35.098
Yep.
Finally we've got them. Again.

01:10:35.098 --> 01:10:37.642
Where are they?
He's in a rectory in Kent.

01:10:37.642 --> 01:10:40.395
But he's coming into town
to see his daughter.

01:10:40.395 --> 01:10:42.981
Then please baby them in.
I'm sorry?

01:10:44.441 --> 01:10:46.944
I don't want anyone
moving towards them.

01:10:48.362 --> 01:10:50.573
I've been working on this
for months.

01:10:50.573 --> 01:10:54.535
I know.
I thought the idea was we were meant
to be trying to catch them.

01:10:54.535 --> 01:10:57.497
We are. But don't detain them.
Keep them under surveillance.

01:10:57.497 --> 01:10:59.583
Keep your distance. That's an order.

01:10:59.583 --> 01:11:02.794
Nobody's to go near them
until they get an order from me.

01:11:05.506 --> 01:11:07.258
I don't believe this.

01:11:10.302 --> 01:11:14.766
If there was any offence,
it's just from caring too much.

01:11:19.771 --> 01:11:22.399
Julianne...
Margot.

01:11:47.968 --> 01:11:50.638
You were right. You were right
to call us... It's Jez.

01:11:50.638 --> 01:11:54.559
Jez? Yes. How do you know?
I've suspected for weeks.
Well then, why didn't you tell me?

01:11:54.559 --> 01:11:57.478
Why didn't I tell you?
Why do you think?

01:11:57.478 --> 01:11:58.855
Because you never ring!

01:11:58.855 --> 01:12:01.816
And also, sorry,
I don't want to live like that.

01:12:01.816 --> 01:12:04.194
Being suspicious of everyone.

01:12:04.194 --> 01:12:06.571
Jesus! Do I ever get a life
that's not about you?

01:12:06.571 --> 01:12:08.031
"What does your father do?"

01:12:08.031 --> 01:12:10.284
"Oh, I can't say,
he's in the civil service."

01:12:10.284 --> 01:12:13.996
As long as I can remember -
"What's Dad doing?" "Don't know.

01:12:13.996 --> 01:12:16.666
"Can't say." You ruined mum's life.
That's ridiculous!

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.627
You ruin the life of everyone
you're close to.

01:12:19.627 --> 01:12:23.006
I was in love with him!
You've never known what that means.

01:12:24.507 --> 01:12:25.967
Human drama.

01:12:25.967 --> 01:12:27.636
She doesn't seem happy.

01:12:27.636 --> 01:12:29.638
He did really work as a DJ?
Yes.

01:12:29.638 --> 01:12:31.265
He did really play in the evenings?

01:12:31.265 --> 01:12:33.559
Yes. Everything else was a lie.

01:12:33.559 --> 01:12:36.562
Like he said he'd be here
for the birth... Julianne...

01:12:36.562 --> 01:12:39.399
Which he won't. And never had
any intention of being.

01:12:39.399 --> 01:12:41.276
OK. Right from the start!

01:12:41.276 --> 01:12:42.986
Julianne... Just leave me.

01:12:42.986 --> 01:12:44.612
Please...

01:12:44.612 --> 01:12:47.115
Every time she moves
she gets closer to us.

01:12:47.115 --> 01:12:48.742
Can you hear anything?

01:12:48.742 --> 01:12:51.787
No. Lip-read.

01:12:51.787 --> 01:12:54.748
Don't come near me! Don't touch me!

01:12:54.748 --> 01:12:57.668
"And then when she's calm,
I'll have dealt with her."

01:12:57.668 --> 01:12:59.170
That's not fair.

01:12:59.170 --> 01:13:02.131
Why don't you just say, "Julianne,
I'm sorry, this is my fault?"

01:13:02.131 --> 01:13:04.134
Julianne, I know it's my fault!
Good!

01:13:04.134 --> 01:13:06.594
Why do you think I'm in agony?!
Oh!

01:13:06.594 --> 01:13:09.931
Oh, you're in agony? Oh, really?

01:13:09.931 --> 01:13:12.184
Great. And for how long?

01:13:12.184 --> 01:13:15.145
He's standing there.
Why can't we move in?

01:13:18.107 --> 01:13:19.775
Can anyone tell me what's going on?

01:13:19.775 --> 01:13:21.944
Yeah? Where are you?

01:13:21.944 --> 01:13:24.447
I'm in London. I can't explain.
It's a mess.

01:13:24.447 --> 01:13:26.866
Sorry, comrade,
but we need to jump five stages.

01:13:26.866 --> 01:13:28.952
I've just had a very interesting
call. Who from?

01:13:28.952 --> 01:13:30.162
I'll give you a number.

01:13:30.162 --> 01:13:33.040
You need to call it because he's
ahead of us. He's nine miles ahead.

01:13:34.625 --> 01:13:37.169
Is this who I think it is?

01:13:37.169 --> 01:13:38.504
10 Downing Street.

01:13:38.504 --> 01:13:41.757
'My name is Worricker. I think
you'll find, if you tell him,

01:13:41.757 --> 01:13:44.177
'the Prime Minister will want
to have a word with me.'

01:13:44.177 --> 01:13:46.763
What name again?
'Johnny Worricker.'

01:13:46.763 --> 01:13:47.931
Hold on, will you please?

01:13:49.307 --> 01:13:52.978
Mr Finch, there's a man on the line
called Johnny Worricker...

01:13:55.397 --> 01:13:58.067
Yes, thank you,
please put him through.

01:13:59.318 --> 01:14:01.696
'Hello, who am I speaking to?'

01:14:01.696 --> 01:14:03.364
Is that you, Mr Worricker?

01:14:03.364 --> 01:14:04.615
Yes. 'Good.'

01:14:04.615 --> 01:14:07.619
'I'm sure the Prime Minister would
like you to come in immediately.'

01:14:07.619 --> 01:14:09.829
Come in?
To Downing Street.

01:14:09.829 --> 01:14:12.541
'Good.'
Are you far away?

01:14:12.541 --> 01:14:15.878
Not at all. Less than a minute.

01:14:15.878 --> 01:14:19.632
But just one thing.
Could you come in the back?

01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:46.494
My name is Johnny Worricker,
I'm expected.

01:14:46.494 --> 01:14:47.954
OK, sir.

01:15:13.732 --> 01:15:15.317
KNOCK ON DOOR

01:15:18.236 --> 01:15:21.073
Ah...here you are at last.

01:15:21.073 --> 01:15:22.491
Prime Minister.

01:15:23.993 --> 01:15:26.537
The missing piece of the jigsaw.

01:15:26.537 --> 01:15:28.080
You can leave us.

01:15:31.876 --> 01:15:34.754
How was your spell as an emigre?
Disconcerting.

01:15:34.754 --> 01:15:38.467
I'm sure.
I needed to see you one more time.

01:15:38.467 --> 01:15:40.594
Me too.
Please...

01:15:47.893 --> 01:15:50.563
We had a good talk in Cambridge
six months ago.

01:15:50.563 --> 01:15:54.150
But then you went off and did
the very opposite of what I asked.

01:15:54.150 --> 01:15:56.486
You defied me.
Sir, if I may...

01:15:56.486 --> 01:15:57.988
Carry on.

01:15:57.988 --> 01:16:02.200
I accept in the circumstances
that I'm fair game. Of course.

01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:04.870
But my daughter's flat is
being bugged.

01:16:04.870 --> 01:16:09.291
An M15 operative seduced her
when she was already pregnant.

01:16:09.291 --> 01:16:13.212
My daughter isn't fair game.
Go after me, don't go after her.

01:16:14.339 --> 01:16:17.133
I agree.
I'm sorry...?

01:16:17.133 --> 01:16:19.344
You're right. Mutual hysteria.

01:16:20.720 --> 01:16:22.389
Isn't it time it was defused?

01:16:26.935 --> 01:16:29.980
I'll tell you what
I've been thinking -

01:16:29.980 --> 01:16:33.025
I've accomplished pretty much
all I set out to do.

01:16:33.025 --> 01:16:35.236
We've modernised the country
and we may even

01:16:35.236 --> 01:16:38.114
have alerted its people
to some of the dangers they face.

01:16:38.114 --> 01:16:40.784
I don't understand.
Are you resigning?

01:16:40.784 --> 01:16:43.495
You're not getting my scalp,
if that's what you hope.

01:16:43.495 --> 01:16:45.706
I'm not moving out, I'm moving up.

01:16:47.958 --> 01:16:49.877
It's Iran we have to deal with now.

01:16:49.877 --> 01:16:52.797
And I'm not fussy about
what platform I work from.

01:16:52.797 --> 01:16:56.300
Perhaps a sympathetic American
president means more to me

01:16:56.300 --> 01:16:58.595
than an ambivalent
British electorate.

01:16:58.595 --> 01:17:00.680
You're planning to move on
to another job?

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.724
Correct. What job is that?

01:17:02.724 --> 01:17:05.811
Consul General to Iran.
I run the peace talks.

01:17:05.811 --> 01:17:09.106
Peace?
Well...preferably peace.

01:17:09.106 --> 01:17:10.649
Answering to whom?

01:17:10.649 --> 01:17:13.778
Financed by the Americans,
but given cover by the UN.

01:17:15.488 --> 01:17:18.074
Forgive me, I'm not sure
you're going to be able

01:17:18.074 --> 01:17:19.742
to cut free as easily as that.

01:17:19.742 --> 01:17:21.411
Aren't you? No.

01:17:21.411 --> 01:17:23.496
Is that a threat?
Not at all.

01:17:23.496 --> 01:17:25.373
Tell me,
are you running a campaign?

01:17:25.373 --> 01:17:28.085
Because that's how it looks.

01:17:28.085 --> 01:17:31.505
A single intelligence officer
determined to stop me.

01:17:32.965 --> 01:17:34.425
What are you?

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.719
A loose cannon?

01:17:38.096 --> 01:17:39.764
A traitor?

01:17:45.478 --> 01:17:47.397
Well, then, what are you doing?

01:17:50.067 --> 01:17:53.445
Judiciously pointing out
the dangers. Such as?

01:17:53.445 --> 01:17:56.490
There's a new boss at the CIA.
Yes, you're right.

01:17:56.490 --> 01:17:59.035
With new plans.
Wants to make a clean break.

01:17:59.035 --> 01:18:01.120
The president's already
had a word with him.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:03.414
I think you'll find any future
CIA investigation

01:18:03.414 --> 01:18:06.835
into private contractors will get
bogged down pretty quickly.

01:18:07.836 --> 01:18:09.963
People don't like
investigating each other,

01:18:09.963 --> 01:18:13.759
because they are aware that later
they may be investigated themselves.

01:18:13.759 --> 01:18:15.511
If you talk to the President,

01:18:15.511 --> 01:18:17.763
you'll find he's pretty clear
on the subject.

01:18:17.763 --> 01:18:20.475
After all, one day he's going to be
an ex-President too.

01:18:20.475 --> 01:18:23.895
And here? Here?
Yes. In the UK?

01:18:23.895 --> 01:18:25.939
You don't think
you face problems here?

01:18:25.939 --> 01:18:27.440
I don't see any.

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:30.152
My favoured successor is hardly
likely to waste her first

01:18:30.152 --> 01:18:33.530
hundred days digging too deeply into
the financial affairs of the Bridge.

01:18:33.530 --> 01:18:37.868
To what end? Anthea's experiencing
a period of personal good fortune.

01:18:37.868 --> 01:18:39.412
Maybe you read about it?

01:18:39.412 --> 01:18:41.622
When it comes to sleeping dogs,

01:18:41.622 --> 01:18:44.375
Anthea's the kind
who'll let them lie.

01:18:47.045 --> 01:18:51.425
What is it they say?
"The Establishment always wins."

01:18:51.425 --> 01:18:53.176
You should know that.

01:18:53.176 --> 01:18:56.430
You're a distinguished member
of the Establishment yourself.

01:18:58.974 --> 01:19:01.352
What did you think
we were going to do?

01:19:02.645 --> 01:19:04.188
Bleach you?

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:07.567
We don't bleach people in England.

01:19:10.237 --> 01:19:12.656
No home. No bank account.

01:19:12.656 --> 01:19:16.785
No security. No way of life,
100% surveillance.

01:19:16.785 --> 01:19:18.537
You know the drill.

01:19:18.537 --> 01:19:21.749
You've done it to others,
now we'll do it to you.

01:19:34.721 --> 01:19:37.432
What are you offering?
Good question.

01:19:37.432 --> 01:19:39.018
An amnesty?

01:19:39.018 --> 01:19:40.603
Johnny...

01:19:42.605 --> 01:19:46.484
..in the last few years, the
government moved at a certain speed

01:19:46.484 --> 01:19:48.820
because we faced
an overwhelming threat.

01:19:50.905 --> 01:19:52.282
This is the real world.

01:19:52.282 --> 01:19:56.078
There's always a tension
between aims and means.

01:19:56.078 --> 01:19:57.955
Maybe even a contradiction.

01:20:00.082 --> 01:20:03.085
I'll live with that.
The question is, can you?

01:20:05.796 --> 01:20:07.173
We need your silence.

01:20:11.636 --> 01:20:14.180
I'm to be silent about lawlessness?

01:20:16.141 --> 01:20:20.062
Permanently and guaranteed.
You've got to think what that means.

01:20:23.107 --> 01:20:25.025
I've thought about it a great deal.

01:20:26.861 --> 01:20:29.238
You make a deal, you go back on it.

01:20:30.823 --> 01:20:32.784
In my world, you only do that once.

01:20:42.920 --> 01:20:46.757
Now, if you'll forgive me,
I have to go to the Palace.

01:20:46.757 --> 01:20:49.969
I'd offer you a lift
but you might be conspicuous.

01:20:49.969 --> 01:20:54.057
Anyway, I imagine you have to report
to that crapulous Scot in the park.

01:20:54.057 --> 01:20:56.393
I don't report to him. No?

01:20:59.771 --> 01:21:02.608
You say you'd like your daughter
left alone. I would.

01:21:02.608 --> 01:21:04.818
And your girlfriend too,
I should think.

01:21:04.818 --> 01:21:07.154
She's a very interesting woman,
isn't she?

01:21:07.154 --> 01:21:10.032
This one really is something
more than run of the mill.

01:21:11.701 --> 01:21:13.786
You're a lucky man, aren't you?

01:21:13.786 --> 01:21:16.206
You never seem to suffer
for your mistakes.

01:21:17.624 --> 01:21:18.833
What a gift.

01:21:20.710 --> 01:21:24.047
We're both cats
who fall on our feet. Ted!

01:21:24.047 --> 01:21:27.092
Mr Worricker's leaving.
We won't be seeing him again.

01:21:43.610 --> 01:21:44.903
So, what's happening?

01:21:44.903 --> 01:21:46.572
He's quitting.
Quitting?

01:21:46.572 --> 01:21:49.074
He moves on to Iran. Promotion.

01:21:49.074 --> 01:21:51.494
Promotion -
is that what he's calling it?

01:21:51.494 --> 01:21:54.622
This doesn't feel like a victory.
Why does it not feel like a victory?

01:21:54.622 --> 01:21:57.333
Obvious. Because I don't think
we've ever been in control.

01:21:57.333 --> 01:22:00.253
You're to call Jill Tankard.
She wants to see you. Where?

01:22:00.253 --> 01:22:03.006
Wherever you say. She knows
I'm with you? Seems to.

01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:05.425
Well, yeah, of course.
That fits. We've been used.

01:22:05.425 --> 01:22:08.095
All the time they've known
everything. Are you going to go?

01:22:08.095 --> 01:22:12.058
I don't know. I'm trying to get hold
of Julianne. She not answering.
Fuck!

01:22:12.058 --> 01:22:14.602
I'm trying Margot.
I left them together.

01:22:17.146 --> 01:22:18.648
Shit!

01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:23.361
Johnny? Yes?

01:22:23.361 --> 01:22:25.322
If you do see Jill,
could you do me a favour?

01:22:28.200 --> 01:22:29.827
Try and get me back in.

01:22:48.639 --> 01:22:50.099
Welcome back.

01:22:51.517 --> 01:22:54.562
I heard you had
a nice time with Alec.

01:22:54.562 --> 01:22:58.608
Jill. It's a shame
you two never got close.

01:22:58.608 --> 01:23:01.528
They always say it's difficult
if two men are too alike.

01:23:01.528 --> 01:23:04.114
One of those boys'
love-hate things, is it?

01:23:09.786 --> 01:23:12.873
It's happening. Now.
Even as we speak.

01:23:12.873 --> 01:23:16.794
What is? He's seeing the Queen.
You must be pleased.

01:23:16.794 --> 01:23:20.798
Why? Well, wasn't it your idea
to bring him down?

01:23:20.798 --> 01:23:23.009
It's interesting
you should say that.

01:23:23.009 --> 01:23:26.513
As a matter of fact, Jill,
I rather thought it was yours.

01:23:26.513 --> 01:23:30.809
Ah, Mr Worricker we haven't seen you
for such a long time.

01:23:30.809 --> 01:23:32.311
I've missed you too.

01:23:32.311 --> 01:23:35.105
We still have a bottle of scotch
in the back.

01:23:35.105 --> 01:23:37.233
Do you mind fetching it?

01:23:40.486 --> 01:23:43.281
I tell you, I had my suspicions
for quite a long time.

01:23:43.281 --> 01:23:46.117
Really? I noticed
things were strangely easy.

01:23:46.117 --> 01:23:48.161
As if our paths were being smoothed.

01:23:48.161 --> 01:23:51.415
I mean, the choice of Amber Page...

01:23:51.415 --> 01:23:52.791
What about her?

01:23:52.791 --> 01:23:55.711
Never our most brilliant agent,
was she?

01:23:55.711 --> 01:23:58.172
She did the job.
Yeah, badly.

01:23:58.172 --> 01:24:00.007
Amber did her best.

01:24:00.007 --> 01:24:02.260
Yes. That's what I mean.

01:24:03.469 --> 01:24:05.847
And that business in Kiev...
Kiev, yes.

01:24:05.847 --> 01:24:07.640
..had your fingerprints all over it.

01:24:07.640 --> 01:24:10.018
You think so? You liked that,
did you? I liked it,

01:24:10.018 --> 01:24:12.312
I wasn't sure
why Beasley had agreed to it.

01:24:12.312 --> 01:24:14.898
It wasn't in his interest. I didn't
ask. I didn't need to.

01:24:14.898 --> 01:24:18.444
How did you do that? I've been
a long time in Whitehall, remember?

01:24:18.444 --> 01:24:20.446
I'm a data bank, Johnny.

01:24:20.446 --> 01:24:25.118
And, please, don't make this out
to be some sort of coup.

01:24:25.118 --> 01:24:26.411
Why? Wasn't it?

01:24:26.411 --> 01:24:29.706
No. I wouldn't dream of messing
with the electorate's wishes.

01:24:29.706 --> 01:24:32.626
That's way above my pay grade.
What would you call it then?

01:24:32.626 --> 01:24:34.753
All I did was make
some preparations.

01:24:34.753 --> 01:24:37.297
That's all I did
for an orderly hand-over.

01:24:37.297 --> 01:24:39.216
As any good democrat would.

01:24:41.302 --> 01:24:43.971
That's very good. Thank you.

01:24:43.971 --> 01:24:45.932
I smoothed the way.

01:24:45.932 --> 01:24:48.810
I made what would have been
difficult, easy.

01:24:49.978 --> 01:24:52.147
What I don't understand,
why did you do it?

01:24:52.147 --> 01:24:55.233
Beasley was on your side. Your whole
life, you owe him everything.

01:24:55.233 --> 01:24:56.902
He was the one who put you in place.

01:24:56.902 --> 01:25:00.322
Why did I do it? Yes. Simple.
Same reason as you.

01:25:02.158 --> 01:25:04.410
Johnny, I saw the evidence.

01:25:04.410 --> 01:25:07.705
When I saw the evidence,
I knew he was finished.

01:25:07.705 --> 01:25:11.626
Ah, thank you, you're very kind.

01:25:11.626 --> 01:25:15.338
It belonged to Mr Baron.
We didn't know what to do with it.

01:25:18.342 --> 01:25:20.052
We all loved Mr Baron.

01:25:20.052 --> 01:25:22.012
I'll look after it, thank you.

01:25:22.012 --> 01:25:23.305
I miss him.

01:25:23.305 --> 01:25:25.308
We all miss him.

01:25:35.861 --> 01:25:39.865
Looking back at the events
of the past few years,

01:25:39.865 --> 01:25:43.869
I don't think either of us has been
wholly right or wrong.

01:25:43.869 --> 01:25:46.288
Life doesn't work like that,
does it?

01:25:46.288 --> 01:25:50.877
I can see your point of view
and I suspect that you can see mine.

01:25:52.378 --> 01:25:53.797
You know what I want for you?

01:25:53.797 --> 01:25:55.256
I've got a fair idea.

01:25:55.256 --> 01:25:58.760
You're the best intelligence analyst
I ever met.

01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:01.013
And I'm the best administrator.

01:26:01.013 --> 01:26:04.183
The new prime minister's coming in
with warm feelings towards

01:26:04.183 --> 01:26:06.644
the intelligence services.
You've made sure of that.

01:26:06.644 --> 01:26:09.730
Yes. After what I've done for her,

01:26:09.730 --> 01:26:13.818
these are going to be golden years.
We get everything we want.

01:26:17.948 --> 01:26:19.533
I'd like you to join me.

01:26:23.245 --> 01:26:25.748
You're forgetting.
I've got other obligations.

01:26:25.748 --> 01:26:27.041
People depend on me.

01:26:27.041 --> 01:26:29.251
What sort of people?
My daughter.

01:26:29.251 --> 01:26:32.422
I can promise, come back to work,
she won't be troubled again.

01:26:32.422 --> 01:26:37.635
Rollo. Well, I'm sure we can bring
him back into the fucking fold.

01:26:37.635 --> 01:26:39.346
And most important of all...

01:26:39.346 --> 01:26:41.890
there's Margot.

01:26:41.890 --> 01:26:43.350
Ah, yes, Margot.

01:26:46.979 --> 01:26:49.523
Are you hugging that scotch
to yourself?

01:27:01.578 --> 01:27:03.664
Hasn't worked out, has it, Johnny?

01:27:03.664 --> 01:27:05.958
What makes you say that?

01:27:05.958 --> 01:27:12.006
Oh, come on, I mean, give us some
credit, please. We are
professionals.

01:27:12.006 --> 01:27:14.509
You love falling in love, don't you?

01:27:14.509 --> 01:27:16.844
Just, not so good at being in it.

01:27:20.432 --> 01:27:22.726
Come back to Millbank

01:27:22.726 --> 01:27:26.146
and you're going to be able to
make her a very attractive offer.

01:27:26.146 --> 01:27:27.606
What offer is that?

01:27:28.899 --> 01:27:30.776
For the rest of her life,

01:27:30.776 --> 01:27:35.072
she's going to be able to walk down
the street and not look behind her.

01:27:36.866 --> 01:27:38.409
That's not nothing, Johnny.

01:27:41.121 --> 01:27:43.331
I have a feeling
she's going to take it.

01:27:43.331 --> 01:27:45.125
You don't know her.

01:27:45.125 --> 01:27:47.878
Oh, I think I do.

01:27:53.342 --> 01:27:55.845
I am going to keep
this statement brief.

01:27:58.514 --> 01:28:02.852
I've always said I would leave
office at a time of my own choosing

01:28:02.852 --> 01:28:06.106
and only when I had finished the job
I was elected to do.

01:28:09.818 --> 01:28:11.362
This is that time.

01:28:13.155 --> 01:28:15.950
I leave you strong
and I leave you secure.

01:28:15.950 --> 01:28:17.952
CHEERING

01:28:21.873 --> 01:28:25.377
Congratulations!
You just brought down a government.

01:28:25.377 --> 01:28:30.382
Did I really? I know someone did
but I'm not sure who.

01:28:44.355 --> 01:28:47.817
Any MP will tell you that the most
important people in their life

01:28:47.817 --> 01:28:50.237
are the people who elect them.

01:28:50.237 --> 01:28:53.532
Shall we go out and celebrate?
All right.

01:28:53.532 --> 01:28:57.286
I'll finish the story,
then, yes, let's go and get drunk.

01:29:04.127 --> 01:29:06.337
SHE EXHALES

01:29:06.337 --> 01:29:08.548
DOOR OPENS

01:29:17.892 --> 01:29:19.560
What are you doing?

01:29:23.398 --> 01:29:25.275
I was going to leave you a note.

01:29:25.275 --> 01:29:26.901
What kind of note?

01:29:26.901 --> 01:29:28.194
A goodbye note.

01:29:31.198 --> 01:29:32.532
You knew it was coming.

01:29:35.244 --> 01:29:37.413
I feared it, but I didn't know.

01:29:41.625 --> 01:29:44.545
Where's Julianne?
She's at the hospital.

01:29:44.545 --> 01:29:46.881
What? It's all right.
She doesn't want you to go.

01:29:46.881 --> 01:29:48.883
All right? Why is it all right?

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:52.471
Because her mother's with her.
It's going to be a long labour.

01:29:52.471 --> 01:29:53.930
Can I call?

01:29:53.930 --> 01:29:55.766
No. She's still angry.

01:29:57.684 --> 01:29:59.728
She says you can call
in the morning.

01:30:02.022 --> 01:30:04.108
OK.

01:30:04.108 --> 01:30:05.568
Then I will.

01:30:19.708 --> 01:30:22.628
And you? Where are you heading?

01:30:22.628 --> 01:30:24.922
Oh. A start-up in Hong Kong.

01:30:26.215 --> 01:30:28.343
Really? Yeah.

01:30:28.343 --> 01:30:29.719
Well...

01:30:29.719 --> 01:30:32.764
that's...that's a long way.

01:30:34.015 --> 01:30:35.976
Yeah, well, I've been approached.

01:30:37.269 --> 01:30:39.021
A guy I knew through Stirling.

01:30:40.147 --> 01:30:43.150
He wants to sell clothes
on the internet.

01:30:43.150 --> 01:30:44.777
He sees a gap in the market.

01:30:44.777 --> 01:30:46.195
Does he have a lot of money?

01:30:46.195 --> 01:30:50.074
Not a penny.
That's why he needs someone smart.

01:30:50.074 --> 01:30:53.161
Margot, I made you a lot of promises
back in Turks & Caicos.

01:30:53.161 --> 01:30:56.081
I want to keep them.
Say the word and I will.

01:30:57.999 --> 01:31:01.253
I knew when it came down to it,
you'd always want to go back
to work.

01:31:01.253 --> 01:31:04.548
What, I just walk away
from everything, do I?

01:31:04.548 --> 01:31:07.468
Is that the right thing to do?
I don't think so.

01:31:07.468 --> 01:31:10.555
These days, everyone feels
powerless, I understand that.

01:31:10.555 --> 01:31:12.307
That's what they want you to feel.

01:31:12.307 --> 01:31:14.684
But if we don't fight, who will?

01:31:15.935 --> 01:31:17.896
Johnny, you know these people.

01:31:17.896 --> 01:31:21.066
They slide around,
they have nothing solid.

01:31:22.359 --> 01:31:25.529
For them, it's simply
one day to the next.

01:31:25.529 --> 01:31:28.658
They believe what they have to
and then when the time comes,

01:31:28.658 --> 01:31:31.119
they believe something else.

01:31:31.119 --> 01:31:33.830
For them nothing is ever at stake.

01:31:33.830 --> 01:31:36.332
Look, I know what you're saying,
but even so,

01:31:36.332 --> 01:31:38.793
if it's what you want
I can get you back in.

01:31:38.793 --> 01:31:41.713
I've watched you the last few
months. You're brilliant at it.

01:31:41.713 --> 01:31:44.174
You love it. Yes.

01:31:45.592 --> 01:31:47.136
But I love you more.

01:31:57.981 --> 01:32:00.650
It was quite an adventure,
wasn't it?

01:32:04.446 --> 01:32:05.739
Yes.

01:32:06.991 --> 01:32:08.576
I wouldn't have missed it.

01:32:09.952 --> 01:32:10.953
Me neither.

01:32:13.831 --> 01:32:15.124
I wish we'd done more.

01:32:16.793 --> 01:32:19.170
Oh, Johnny...

01:32:19.170 --> 01:32:21.590
we did plenty.

01:32:39.442 --> 01:32:43.155
I'm going in the morning.
Why don't you just leave?

01:32:49.286 --> 01:32:51.247
I'll miss you.

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:56.461
Yes. I'll miss you too.

01:33:26.952 --> 01:33:29.580

01:33:37.463 --> 01:33:40.967
OK, OK.

01:33:58.778 --> 01:34:01.239

CROWD CLAMOURS

01:34:16.881 --> 01:34:19.425
I just want to say,
it's far too early for me

01:34:19.425 --> 01:34:22.095
to be making any decision
about the future.

01:34:22.095 --> 01:34:26.099
I'm part of a family and I want
to talk to my family first.

01:34:26.099 --> 01:34:29.978
Meanwhile, let's remember
Alec Beasley.

01:34:29.978 --> 01:34:33.732
It's his night.
Let's leave it with him.

01:34:36.402 --> 01:34:38.988
SHE SCREAMS

01:34:40.573 --> 01:34:43.409
Well done. Big one now, big one.
