00:02.150 --> 00:04.040
- Previously on
"The Practice"...

00:04.040 --> 00:05.220
- I had what I would consider

00:05.220 --> 00:10.000
to be an extremely
erotic dream,

00:10.000 --> 00:11.220
and you were in it.

00:11.220 --> 00:13.020
- What do you mean,
she hit on you?

00:13.020 --> 00:14.110
- Well, she--

00:14.110 --> 00:15.160
- While she's the judge
on your case?

00:15.160 --> 00:17.070
- She was going
to recuse herself,

00:17.070 --> 00:18.220
and then she thought
it would have no effect.

00:18.220 --> 00:20.020
- Does this just happen?

00:20.020 --> 00:21.160
Women come up to you

00:21.160 --> 00:23.020
and tell you
that you're in their dreams?

00:23.020 --> 00:26.010
- Lindsay makes
twice my salary?

00:26.010 --> 00:27.180
- Well, Ellenor,
she brings in a lot of business.

00:27.180 --> 00:29.190
Her percentage should be--
- Twice?

00:29.190 --> 00:32.189
$242,000;
that's my problem.

00:32.189 --> 00:34.090
- Since when did you take
such a strong interest

00:34.090 --> 00:35.160
in math, Ellenor?

00:35.160 --> 00:37.080
- Certain equations
fascinate me.

00:37.080 --> 00:39.010
- Try adding two plus two.

00:39.010 --> 00:40.190
You couldn't do that
with your asbestos clients.

00:40.190 --> 00:42.100
- Is this what happens to women
when you insert your penis?

00:42.100 --> 00:43.210
I'm just curious,
because they become...

00:43.210 --> 00:44.210
- Hey!
- Greedy little--

00:44.210 --> 00:47.040
- Lindsay!

00:47.040 --> 00:48.110
- What's going on, Leonard?

00:48.110 --> 00:50.000
- I'm not feeling too good.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.140
I need to get a continuance.
- Oh, God.

00:52.140 --> 00:55.230
I'm practically getting
a contact high off your breath.

00:55.230 --> 00:57.110
- Why do you keep
defending this guy?

00:57.110 --> 00:58.230
- Because I like him,

00:58.230 --> 01:00.090
because he was
my first client ever,

01:00.090 --> 01:01.150
and because he's innocent.

01:01.150 --> 01:02.200
- On the count of possession

01:02.200 --> 01:04.099
of a controlled substance,

01:04.099 --> 01:07.070
we find the defendant
not guilty.

01:07.070 --> 01:09.210
MAN: The jury is dismissed
with the thanks of the Court.

01:09.210 --> 01:13.200
- You did it.
MAN: We're adjourned.

01:13.200 --> 01:15.230
- It means nothing, Leonard,
if you don't get help.

01:15.230 --> 01:17.070
- Why do you care so much?

01:17.070 --> 01:18.230
I'm just--
- I like you, Leonard.

01:18.230 --> 01:22.070
It's not every day
you get to meet good people.

01:22.070 --> 01:23.110
- This I know.

01:27.140 --> 01:28.160
- I had a really good time
last night.

01:28.160 --> 01:31.050
- Me too.

01:31.050 --> 01:32.160
So do you want to come
to the game tonight?

01:32.160 --> 01:33.190
- Is that tonight?

01:33.190 --> 01:35.030
- Yeah.
- Cool.

01:35.030 --> 01:37.110
- So, I'll call you
this afternoon?

01:37.110 --> 01:38.120
- Okay.

01:38.120 --> 01:40.000
- Between now and then,

01:40.000 --> 01:43.000
I'll be missing
my little buttercup.

01:43.000 --> 01:44.220
- You are the sweetest boy.

01:48.170 --> 01:50.110
Come here.

02:07.130 --> 02:08.169
What?

02:08.169 --> 02:10.000
- Ellenor.
- Leonard?

02:10.000 --> 02:11.080
- I think I'm in trouble.

02:11.080 --> 02:13.000
- Hold it! Freeze!
- Don't move.

02:13.000 --> 02:14.100
- Let's see your hands!
- Don't move!

02:14.100 --> 02:16.080
- Hold 'em right there.
- Hands up.

02:16.080 --> 02:18.130
- What the hell is going on?
MAN: Hey, just stay back.

02:18.130 --> 02:20.150
MAN: Hands up.
BOBBY: What is this?

02:20.150 --> 02:23.140
MAN: Stay out of it.
BOBBY: What is this?

02:23.140 --> 02:26.070
- Nothing.
- What's that?

02:26.070 --> 02:27.140
- I don't know.

02:27.140 --> 02:29.010
- How'd it get there?

02:29.010 --> 02:32.000
- I don't know.
- This your desk?

02:32.000 --> 02:33.200
This your desk, ma'am?
- Yes.

02:33.200 --> 02:34.200
- You don't know
how it got there?

02:34.200 --> 02:36.080
- No.

02:36.080 --> 02:37.140
- Please place your hands
behind your back.

02:37.140 --> 02:38.200
BOBBY: What for?
MAN: You have the right

02:38.200 --> 02:39.220
to remain silent.
- Oh, come on.

02:39.220 --> 02:41.070
- You're reading my rights?

02:41.070 --> 02:42.160
MAN: You have the right
to an attorney.

02:42.160 --> 02:44.020
- Yeah, I know my rights.
Is this a joke?

02:44.020 --> 02:47.050
- How did these drugs
get here, ma'am?

02:47.050 --> 02:49.040
- I don't know.
- Cuff 'em both.

02:49.040 --> 02:50.170
- You, sir, have the right
to remain silent.

02:50.170 --> 02:52.030
BOBBY: We'll meet you
at the arraignment.

02:52.030 --> 02:53.040
Obviously don't say anything.

02:53.040 --> 02:54.060
Leonard, that goes for you too.

02:54.060 --> 02:57.040
Don't say a word.

02:57.040 --> 02:58.190
MAN: All right, let's go.
- This is ridiculous.

02:58.190 --> 02:59.190
MAN: Let's go, ma'am.

02:59.190 --> 03:01.050
Just keep moving.

03:04.210 --> 03:07.110

a bad patch.

03:56.190 --> 03:58.000
Rebecca, Leonard, Jimmy,
jump in.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.130
- Bobby, we might be witnesses.

03:59.130 --> 04:00.200
We can't represent--
- What did you see?

04:00.200 --> 04:02.040
- Well, I didn't
see anything, but--

04:02.040 --> 04:03.130
- Lindsay? Becc?
Anybody see Leonard

04:03.130 --> 04:05.070
drop the stuff
on Ellenor's desk?

04:05.070 --> 04:06.170
Nobody?

04:06.170 --> 04:07.220
- I think we were
all looking at the door.

04:07.220 --> 04:09.060
- Leonard came running in first,

04:09.060 --> 04:11.030
and the police
were right behind him.

04:11.030 --> 04:13.090
- Hey, get your nose
out of there.

04:13.090 --> 04:15.000
- Ma'am?
- Ma'am?

04:15.000 --> 04:16.130
- You can't
search that desk.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.100
- We've made an arrest.

04:18.100 --> 04:20.000
- You can only search
the suspect's desk; that's it.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.130
- Anything subject
to the suspect's control.

- Where did that come from?

04:27.180 --> 04:29.210
- Bottom drawer
under some files.

04:29.210 --> 04:31.100
Looks like there's
some dried blood on it.

04:31.100 --> 04:33.210

- Counsel.

04:33.210 --> 04:37.200

- Yeah.

04:37.200 --> 04:38.220
- God, Lindsay.

You been provoking her?

04:43.170 --> 04:45.220
- Your Honor.

04:45.220 --> 04:47.120
- What's going on?

04:47.120 --> 04:48.190
- One of our lawyers
just got arrested--

04:48.190 --> 04:52.000
ALL: Lucy!

04:52.000 --> 04:54.090
- Uh, could we talk
in private?

04:54.090 --> 04:56.080
- Uh, sure.

04:56.080 --> 04:57.150
Um, my office.

04:57.150 --> 05:00.000
Uh, Lucy.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.080
Okay, Eugene, Becc,
get going.

05:01.080 --> 05:02.210
Take Lindsay.

05:02.210 --> 05:04.150
- I'd rather take that case.
- Never mind.

05:04.150 --> 05:05.220
- What--never mind?
- Lindsay.

05:05.220 --> 05:07.120
Go with Eugene and get Helen.

05:07.120 --> 05:08.130
Maybe she could help
with Ellenor.

05:12.170 --> 05:14.160
- What's up?

05:14.160 --> 05:18.110
- Well, you're not gonna
believe it when I tell you.

05:18.110 --> 05:20.090
Actually, you might,
considering.

05:20.090 --> 05:23.160
Um, yesterday afternoon,

05:23.160 --> 05:26.110
I was served
with a complaint against me,

05:26.110 --> 05:30.100
filed under seal
by one of my former law clerks.

05:34.130 --> 05:38.020
He's claiming
sexual harassment.

05:38.020 --> 05:40.010
- What a shock.

05:40.010 --> 05:43.110
- Funny.

05:43.110 --> 05:45.010
The claim is baseless.

05:45.010 --> 05:49.160
Nevertheless, I have to
defend myself against it.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.040
That's why I'm here,
to hire you.

05:52.040 --> 05:53.220
- You want to hire me
to defend you

05:53.220 --> 05:55.100
in a sexual harassment case?

05:55.100 --> 05:57.010
Don't you think
that's a little strange?

05:57.010 --> 05:58.040
- Why?

05:58.040 --> 05:59.160
You're an excellent attorney.

05:59.160 --> 06:01.220
- Who you've had
erotic dreams about.

06:01.220 --> 06:03.050
- Oh, please.

06:03.050 --> 06:04.050
If I had a dime
for every erotic dream

06:04.050 --> 06:05.220
I'd ever had, forget it.

06:05.220 --> 06:09.080
- Oh, is that what you'd say
at your deposition?

06:09.080 --> 06:12.200
- Look, if you choose
not to represent me, it's fine,

06:12.200 --> 06:15.120
but I don't think
you need be discourteous.

06:15.120 --> 06:17.050
I'm sorry to have bothered you.

06:17.050 --> 06:18.160
- Why would you want to hire me?

06:18.160 --> 06:21.000
Sexual harassment
isn't my specialty,

06:21.000 --> 06:23.030
though it would be a good way
to disqualify me

06:23.030 --> 06:26.100
as a witness should I ever
be called to testify.

06:26.100 --> 06:29.160
- And why would you be
called as a witness?

06:29.160 --> 06:31.230
Nobody knows
what happened between us,

06:31.230 --> 06:33.200
unless you told someone.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.130
I certainly didn't.

06:37.130 --> 06:41.140
- Nothing happened
between you and me.

06:41.140 --> 06:44.030
- So then this hostility
just comes out

06:44.030 --> 06:46.140
whenever anybody tries
to engage your services.

06:46.140 --> 06:47.210
- Well, let's just say
I have a hard time

06:47.210 --> 06:49.210
believing you're
totally innocent.

06:49.210 --> 06:51.120
- Let's just say
I have a hard time

06:51.120 --> 06:54.050
believing you only represent
the totally innocent.

06:54.050 --> 06:56.140
- Let's assume,
for the sake of argument,

06:56.140 --> 06:59.030
that I do.

06:59.030 --> 07:03.070
- I am innocent.

07:03.070 --> 07:04.220
I had an affair with the boy.

07:04.220 --> 07:07.170
The truth is, I think
he still has a thing for me.

07:07.170 --> 07:09.130
After he finished
as my law clerk,

07:09.130 --> 07:11.140
he asked me to write him
a letter of recommendation.

07:11.140 --> 07:13.030
I did.

07:13.030 --> 07:15.070
It wasn't glowing enough
in his eyes.

07:15.070 --> 07:16.190
He's retaliating.

07:16.190 --> 07:18.010
- Okay.

07:18.010 --> 07:21.180
Which brings me back
to why me?

07:21.180 --> 07:25.140
- Look, if this goes public,

07:25.140 --> 07:28.170
I--I get destroyed,

07:28.170 --> 07:31.080
merits aside.

07:31.080 --> 07:34.210
I want somebody vicious enough
to make this go away,

07:34.210 --> 07:38.060
who's not afraid
to get ugly if he has to.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.090
I asked around.

07:41.090 --> 07:44.130
Word is, you're it.

07:49.140 --> 07:50.170
EUGENE: She's up first.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.030
Leonard's being called second.

07:52.030 --> 07:53.150
- We have to get him
independent counsel.

07:53.150 --> 07:54.200
- First, let's
get through arraignment.

07:54.200 --> 07:55.210
Did you call him?
WOMAN: All rise.

07:55.210 --> 07:57.050
- I left word.

07:57.050 --> 07:58.100
Oh, no.

07:58.100 --> 07:59.220
It's Judge Whack-a-doo.

07:59.220 --> 08:03.170
EUGENE: Just what we need.
WOMAN: Be seated.

08:03.170 --> 08:05.180
Case number 32111.

08:05.180 --> 08:07.070
Commonwealth versus
Ellenor Frutt.

08:07.070 --> 08:08.150
Possession of
controlled substance.

08:08.150 --> 08:10.030
- Eugene Young
for the defendant.

08:10.030 --> 08:11.080
Waive reading, Your Honor.

08:11.080 --> 08:12.190
I move to dismiss
this right now.

08:12.190 --> 08:15.080
- On what grounds?
- Ms. Frutt's a lawyer.

08:15.080 --> 08:17.110
She represents a man
who charged into our office.

08:17.110 --> 08:18.160
- Objection.

08:18.160 --> 08:20.210
- What the hell?

08:20.210 --> 08:22.120
- Your Honor,
I work with Mr. Young.

08:22.120 --> 08:25.000
MAN: Hurry up.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.110
- What are you doing?

08:26.110 --> 08:28.040
- Technically,
we still represent Leonard.

08:28.040 --> 08:30.000
You can't be serving up
facts that incriminate him,

08:30.000 --> 08:33.150
even if they help Ellenor.

08:33.150 --> 08:37.020
- Your Honor,
the police charged

08:37.020 --> 08:38.190
into our office
chasing a man

08:38.190 --> 08:40.220
they believed
had drugs in his possession.

08:40.220 --> 08:42.059
This man ran
to Ms. Frutt's desk.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.000
The police followed.

08:44.000 --> 08:46.130
Suddenly, drugs were discovered
on Ms. Frutts's desk.

08:46.130 --> 08:47.230
They asked her
how they got there.

08:47.230 --> 08:50.010
She, of course,
refused to answer any questions,

08:50.010 --> 08:53.080
and they arrested her for
having drugs in her possession,

08:53.080 --> 08:55.000
and it's bogus.

08:55.000 --> 08:56.100
- Is that what happened?

08:56.100 --> 08:58.230
- From what I know,
that seems accurate.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.140
- Out of line.

09:00.140 --> 09:01.210
Out of line.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.080
Arresting the lawyer?

09:03.080 --> 09:05.180
- Your Honor,
Ms. Frutt was given opportunity

09:05.180 --> 09:08.130
to explain how the drugs
came into her possession

09:08.130 --> 09:10.080
- But if a client
dropped them there,

09:10.080 --> 09:12.070
then she's not free
to say so, is she?

09:12.070 --> 09:14.080
I want to know
who the officer is.

09:14.080 --> 09:16.030
I want to know who said,
"Okay," to this.

09:16.030 --> 09:17.110
This case is dismissed.

09:17.110 --> 09:19.160
Dismissed.
Dismissed.

09:19.160 --> 09:23.090
We don't go around
arresting lawyers.

09:23.090 --> 09:26.040
Next case, next case, next case.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.080
WOMAN: 32112.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.000
Commonwealth versus
Leonard Sowers.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.030
Possession of
controlled substance.

09:31.030 --> 09:32.160
- Rebecca Washington

09:32.160 --> 09:33.190
representing the defendant,
Your Honor.

09:33.190 --> 09:35.050
Waive reading.

09:35.050 --> 09:37.060
I, too, ask that you
dismiss all charges.

09:37.060 --> 09:38.130
- Why?

09:38.130 --> 09:40.010
- As the police report
stipulates,

09:40.010 --> 09:41.170
they didn't find
any drugs on my client.

09:41.170 --> 09:43.110
They were on
Ellenor Frutt's desk.

09:43.110 --> 09:46.000
- Wait a second, second, second.

09:46.000 --> 09:47.080
This is the guy
who went running in

09:47.080 --> 09:49.170
so forth, so forth,
so forth, drugs?

09:49.170 --> 09:51.070
- Well, there's
no evidence of that.

09:51.070 --> 09:53.110
The heroin was only
found on the desk,

09:53.110 --> 09:55.060
never in Mr. Sowers's
possession.

09:55.060 --> 09:56.180
- What do I look like to you?

09:56.180 --> 09:57.200
A big dope?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.080
Am I a big dope to you?

09:59.080 --> 10:01.230
He's got a record
as long as my intestine.

10:01.230 --> 10:03.200
He's a drug addict.

10:03.200 --> 10:05.020
Do I look like a dope?

10:05.020 --> 10:06.120
- You do not look like a dope.

10:06.120 --> 10:08.060
- You have got a God awful,

10:08.060 --> 10:11.010
scum-sucking,
guilty client here.

10:11.010 --> 10:12.110
We all know that.

10:12.110 --> 10:13.230
Drug addict!
- Your Honor.

10:13.230 --> 10:16.150
- Get yourself a jury.

10:16.150 --> 10:18.010
I mean,
they're the dopes.

10:18.010 --> 10:20.170
They'll probably let him go.

10:20.170 --> 10:23.060
Not dismissed.
Bound over.

10:23.060 --> 10:27.050
And no bail either,
because you got me angry.

10:27.050 --> 10:29.080
Next case, next case, next case.

10:29.080 --> 10:33.020
And give me something good.

10:33.020 --> 10:34.200
- You sold me out.
- I did not sell you out.

10:34.200 --> 10:37.030
- You said in open court
the drugs were in my possession.

10:37.030 --> 10:38.150
- I said it for the purpose
of Leonard's case.

10:38.150 --> 10:40.020
- In my possession?

10:40.020 --> 10:41.110
- Your case was already
dismissed, Ellenor.

10:41.110 --> 10:42.150
- Oh yes, Lindsay,
take her side.

10:42.150 --> 10:44.150
I expect nothing less.
- Hey.

10:44.150 --> 10:45.230
- This again?
- Why is she even here?

10:45.230 --> 10:47.210
- To kick your ass
like I did before.

10:47.210 --> 10:49.140
- Oh, please,
like you could even hurt me.

10:49.140 --> 10:51.020
- What the hell
is wrong with you two?

10:51.020 --> 10:53.000
- Isn't it obvious?
You said something

10:53.000 --> 10:54.030
she didn't like,
and it's clearly my fault.

10:54.030 --> 10:55.220
- Enough.
- Ellenor.

10:55.220 --> 10:57.030
- I've been paging you.

10:57.030 --> 10:59.110
- Yeah, well, some bad news.

10:59.110 --> 11:00.220
- Ellenor Frutt,

11:00.220 --> 11:02.140
please place your hands
behind your back.

11:02.140 --> 11:04.000
- Excuse me?

11:04.000 --> 11:05.170
- You have the right
to remain silent...

11:05.170 --> 11:06.170
- Now what?

11:06.170 --> 11:08.140
Enough with the Miranda.

11:08.140 --> 11:10.060
What's going on now?

11:10.060 --> 11:11.170
- The knife they found
in your drawer.

11:11.170 --> 11:13.070
Did George Vogelman
give it to you?

11:13.070 --> 11:15.050
- What?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.060
- It's the weapon used
to cut off Susan Robin's head.

11:39.050 --> 11:40.150

11:40.150 --> 11:42.070

11:46.060 --> 11:48.010
In my opinion,
the search was illegal.

11:49.230 --> 11:52.000

11:54.220 --> 11:57.050
Eugene,

12:00.210 --> 12:03.000
She's being sued.

LINDSAY: Bobby, she--

12:04.190 --> 12:07.090
- Lindsay, go see Ellenor.

12:07.090 --> 12:10.090
Jimmy, I need you
to help me here.

12:10.090 --> 12:12.140
Do they know it's
the murder weapon?

12:12.140 --> 12:13.220
- It matches the blade.

12:13.220 --> 12:15.150
They're testing
the blood scrapings.

12:15.150 --> 12:18.010
- How the hell did it
get in her desk?

12:18.010 --> 12:20.180
- I don't know.

12:20.180 --> 12:22.000
It was the bottom left drawer?

12:22.000 --> 12:23.190
- Under some old files.

12:23.190 --> 12:25.160
Do you even remember the last
time you looked down there?

12:25.160 --> 12:28.020
- No!

12:28.020 --> 12:30.090
So somebody's framing me
or George.

12:30.090 --> 12:32.080
- Did George Vogelman
ever have access?

12:32.080 --> 12:34.070
Was he ever in the office alone?

12:34.070 --> 12:36.050
- It isn't him, Lindsay.

12:36.050 --> 12:37.160
- Can you really know that now?

12:37.160 --> 12:38.200
- Yes.

12:42.030 --> 12:45.160
- Okay.

12:45.160 --> 12:46.160

Division one.

12:48.030 --> 12:53.040
I can't imagine
they'll set bail, but--

12:53.040 --> 12:55.070
- I don't believe
this is really happening.

12:55.070 --> 12:57.200
A guy comes in,
he throws heroin at me,

12:57.200 --> 13:01.000
and I'm suddenly being held
for concealing a murder weapon?

13:01.000 --> 13:04.020
- It's gonna go away, Ellenor.

13:04.020 --> 13:05.210
Don't worry.

13:12.210 --> 13:14.060
- Can I help you?

13:14.060 --> 13:15.190
- I'm looking
for Dr. George Vogelman.

13:15.190 --> 13:18.120
Does he work here?
- He does, or did.

13:18.120 --> 13:20.080
You're about
ten minutes too late.

13:20.080 --> 13:22.180
- Sorry?
- The police just arrested him.

13:22.180 --> 13:25.160
Took him away.

13:25.160 --> 13:27.130
- The same charge: concealment.

13:27.130 --> 13:29.030
- And he's in custody?

13:29.030 --> 13:30.210
- Eugene's on his way
to see him in lockup.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.050
Lindsay talked to Helen.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.210
She thinks the police
are determined

13:33.210 --> 13:35.090
to get him all over again.

13:35.090 --> 13:37.070
Is concealment
a lesser included?

13:37.070 --> 13:38.070
- To murder?

13:38.070 --> 13:39.160
No way.
He's free game.

13:39.160 --> 13:40.170
- Bobby Donnell?

13:40.170 --> 13:42.000
- Yeah.

13:42.000 --> 13:44.090
- Milton Cables.
- Oh, hi.

13:44.090 --> 13:45.190
Thanks for agreeing to come.

13:45.190 --> 13:47.190
Uh, Jimmy Berluti.
- A pleasure.

13:47.190 --> 13:49.050
- As I said on the phone,
Judge Kittleson

13:49.050 --> 13:51.090
is very anxious
to dispose of this.

13:51.090 --> 13:53.010
- As is Mr. Michaels.

13:53.010 --> 13:55.000
He certainly doesn't want
to begin his law career

13:55.000 --> 13:57.090
as a plaintiff
in a sexual harassment case.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.230
That's why we filed under seal.

13:58.230 --> 14:00.130
- Which I appreciate.

14:00.130 --> 14:02.110
Listen, we've been hit
with a little emergency,

14:02.110 --> 14:03.230
and unfortunately,
I have to run out.

14:03.230 --> 14:06.170
If we could agree
to depose the two parties,

14:06.170 --> 14:08.070
also under seal,
do it right here,

14:08.070 --> 14:09.210
get some kind
of assessment on the case,

14:09.210 --> 14:12.190
we can pick a number
and be done.

14:12.190 --> 14:14.050
- Can she go first?

14:14.050 --> 14:17.000
- Sure, 6:00 tonight?
- Tonight?

14:17.000 --> 14:19.080
- You could always
depose her again if you want.

14:19.080 --> 14:21.170
My feeling is, if we could
flush out some facts quick,

14:21.170 --> 14:23.020
I think we could get rid of it.

14:23.020 --> 14:26.150
The faster the better
for both sides.

14:26.150 --> 14:28.130
- Okay, I'll see you
at 6:00 tonight.

14:28.130 --> 14:29.180
- Great.
Jimmy.

14:29.180 --> 14:32.020
Sorry to run out.

14:32.020 --> 14:33.180
- I'm so sorry.
- Leonard?

14:33.180 --> 14:35.040
- I never meant to hurt her.

14:35.040 --> 14:36.140
- Leonard,
you need to stop crying

14:36.140 --> 14:37.190
and listen to me.

14:37.190 --> 14:39.020
- I love Ellenor.

14:39.020 --> 14:40.140
- I know you do.

14:40.140 --> 14:42.190
And for you to help her,
you see,

14:42.190 --> 14:44.120
we may have to be
making statements

14:44.120 --> 14:47.000
that go against your interests,
which means you might need

14:47.000 --> 14:49.010
to get a new lawyer
for the time being.

14:49.010 --> 14:50.120
- I want Ellenor.

14:50.120 --> 14:52.000
- Well, Ellenor
isn't available right now.

14:52.000 --> 14:54.050
- I love Ellenor.
- She is in jail, Leonard.

14:54.050 --> 14:55.170
- She's always stuck by me.

14:55.170 --> 14:57.050
I can't--

14:57.050 --> 14:59.000
- Okay, well, what I am
trying to tell you is,

14:59.000 --> 15:02.050
we won't be sticking by you.

15:02.050 --> 15:04.110
- I love Ellenor.

15:04.110 --> 15:06.090
- Son of a bitch.

15:08.110 --> 15:10.150
- I have no idea.

15:10.150 --> 15:11.200
Want me to say it again?

15:11.200 --> 15:13.100
- Well, you better think,
George.

15:13.100 --> 15:14.230
Think who could have
stuck that knife in that drawer.

15:14.230 --> 15:16.110
Otherwise--
- I've heard that speech.

15:16.110 --> 15:17.230
"You better think, George!

15:17.230 --> 15:19.050
"Better think who could have
put that head

15:19.050 --> 15:22.080
in your medical bag,
otherwise--"

15:22.080 --> 15:25.130
- Now is not the time
to get snide.

15:25.130 --> 15:28.130
This is Ellenor on the line now,
not just you.

15:28.130 --> 15:30.220
- I know that.

15:30.220 --> 15:33.160
Why would I ever
put a knife in her drawer?

15:33.160 --> 15:37.010
Or if I did give it to her,
why would she even take it?

15:37.010 --> 15:38.170
Somebody's doing something here.

15:38.170 --> 15:40.190
- And you can't think of
who it could possibly be?

15:40.190 --> 15:44.060
- No.

15:44.060 --> 15:45.150
- George, I'll tell you this.

15:45.150 --> 15:47.220
If I ever get wind--
- You'll what?

15:47.220 --> 15:49.050
Beat me up?

15:49.050 --> 15:50.140
Do it.

15:50.140 --> 15:52.060
I've been out of work
for six months.

15:52.060 --> 15:53.200
I finally got hired
two days ago.

15:53.200 --> 15:56.060
Two days ago,
and what happens?

15:56.060 --> 15:59.050
In come the police
to take me away again.

15:59.050 --> 16:01.020
Go ahead, Eugene,
beat the hell out of me.

16:01.020 --> 16:02.190
I need the money.

16:06.060 --> 16:08.170
WOMAN: Case number 32632.

16:08.170 --> 16:10.080
Commonwealth versus
Ellenor Frutt.

16:10.080 --> 16:11.170
- Bobby Donnell
for the defense, Your Honor.

16:11.170 --> 16:13.040
Waive reading.

16:13.040 --> 16:14.080
I ask that this court
dismiss all charges

16:14.080 --> 16:15.080
on the grounds--

16:15.080 --> 16:16.180
- Dismiss, dismiss.

16:16.180 --> 16:18.100
Everybody's getting up
and asking me

16:18.100 --> 16:19.180
to dismiss charges.

16:19.180 --> 16:21.030
What do I look like, hmm?

16:21.030 --> 16:22.210
- Well, under
the circumstances, I--

16:22.210 --> 16:24.040
- I've already dismissed charges

16:24.040 --> 16:25.100
against this woman once today.

16:25.100 --> 16:27.050
That's all she gets.

16:27.050 --> 16:28.200
I don't just kick things here,

16:28.200 --> 16:30.090
especially in murder cases.

16:30.090 --> 16:31.140
Not dismissed.

16:31.140 --> 16:34.000
No, no, no!

16:34.000 --> 16:37.170
- What do you mean,
"murder case"?

16:37.170 --> 16:40.070
- Yes, it's murder
your client is charged with,

16:40.070 --> 16:41.070
first-degree murder.

16:41.070 --> 16:42.140
If you didn't know that,

16:42.140 --> 16:44.070
why the hell
did you waive reading?

16:44.070 --> 16:48.030
- What's going on here?

16:48.030 --> 16:49.150
What is going on?

16:49.150 --> 16:52.000
MAN: Talk to me, Counselor.

16:52.000 --> 16:53.190
Never mind, don't.

16:53.190 --> 16:56.060
Now I'm mad, all right?

16:56.060 --> 16:58.030
Next case.
Give me something good.

16:58.030 --> 16:59.190
- What the hell is this?

16:59.190 --> 17:03.060
- Why don't we
find a room to talk?

17:08.210 --> 17:10.010
- There's enough there.

17:10.010 --> 17:11.150
- For a murder charge?

17:11.150 --> 17:12.230
- Well, I'm not saying
we're gonna make,

17:12.230 --> 17:14.130
but we got to face
a few facts here.

17:14.130 --> 17:16.170
She had a romantic relationship
with this Vogelman.

17:16.170 --> 17:18.040
- That was two years ago.

17:18.040 --> 17:19.220
- Well, love's been
known to smolder.

17:19.220 --> 17:21.069
- Is this a joke?

17:21.069 --> 17:23.010
- She's found
with the murder weapon,

17:23.010 --> 17:26.180
and we all know
Ellenor has a temper.

17:26.180 --> 17:29.210
- What do you want, Richard?

17:29.210 --> 17:31.090
- Vogelman.

17:31.090 --> 17:33.100
She testifies that
he gave her the knife,

17:33.100 --> 17:35.120
well, maybe we can
make things go easy on her.

17:35.120 --> 17:36.200
- First of all,
I have no knowledge

17:36.200 --> 17:37.220
that he gave her the knife.

17:37.220 --> 17:39.100
Second, you can't get Vogelman.

17:39.100 --> 17:40.200
Double jeopardy.

17:40.200 --> 17:42.050
- Oh, we can't
get him on murder,

17:42.050 --> 17:43.160
but we can on concealment
and perjury.

17:43.160 --> 17:46.000
- Third, this is
blatant blackmail.

17:46.000 --> 17:48.140
- This is a settlement
negotiation.

17:48.140 --> 17:52.200
- You're charging a lawyer
with murder to get her client?

17:52.200 --> 17:54.160
This is way over the line.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.150
- Bobby, you guys accused
a victim's brother of murder

17:56.150 --> 17:58.010
just to get your client off,

17:58.010 --> 17:59.160
and you want to debate
where the line is?

17:59.160 --> 18:00.170
- We're defense attorneys.

18:00.170 --> 18:02.030
It's different.

18:02.030 --> 18:05.000
- Discuss the offer
with Ellenor

18:05.000 --> 18:06.140
and then get back to me.

18:12.170 --> 18:14.010
- I don't believe it.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.040
- I've got
the motion to suppress

18:15.040 --> 18:16.090
marked up for tomorrow.

18:16.090 --> 18:17.200
- With that judge?
- No, thank God.

18:17.200 --> 18:19.060
Judge West.

18:19.060 --> 18:20.140
- How is George?
- Not good.

18:20.140 --> 18:21.140
They denied bail.

18:21.140 --> 18:23.020
- For concealing evidence?

18:23.020 --> 18:24.140
- And perjury,
obstruction of justice.

18:24.140 --> 18:25.170
They're on a mission, Bobby.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.050
They're out for him,

18:27.050 --> 18:29.090
and now they have
the perfect chance.

18:34.220 --> 18:36.190
- So you don't deny the affair?

18:36.190 --> 18:38.150
- No, I don't.

18:38.150 --> 18:40.220
Nor did I regret it
until yesterday.

18:40.220 --> 18:42.150
- Can you tell us
how your relationship

18:42.150 --> 18:44.030
with Kevin Michaels began?

18:44.030 --> 18:45.170
- Our professional
relationship began

18:45.170 --> 18:47.000
when I hired him
out of law school

18:47.000 --> 18:48.180
to clerk for me.

18:48.180 --> 18:52.100
Our physical relationship
began about four months later.

18:52.100 --> 18:54.050
It was a Friday night.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.220
We were going over a draft

18:55.220 --> 18:59.010
of a rather convoluted opinion
regarding stock fraud,

18:59.010 --> 19:03.180
and uh, well,

19:03.180 --> 19:07.140
I suppose one might say
I seduced him.

19:07.140 --> 19:09.200
- Why might one say that?

19:09.200 --> 19:11.160
- Because I did.

19:15.130 --> 19:17.180
- Can you be more specific?

19:17.180 --> 19:19.040
- Do I need to be?

19:19.040 --> 19:20.150
The basis of this lawsuit

19:20.150 --> 19:23.110
concerns what happened
after he left my employ.

19:23.110 --> 19:25.150
We can all stipulate
to the sexual affair.

19:25.150 --> 19:28.030
- We're on a fast course
to settle this.

19:28.030 --> 19:30.020
I need to flesh out
some of the background

19:30.020 --> 19:31.200
before advising my client.

19:38.150 --> 19:40.120
- All right.

19:40.120 --> 19:44.190
We were working side by side
going over this draft.

19:44.190 --> 19:46.160
He reached across
for something--

19:46.160 --> 19:49.180
I don't remember what--

19:49.180 --> 19:52.170
and he inadvertently
brushed my breast.

19:52.170 --> 19:54.180
He began to apologize profusely,

19:54.180 --> 19:58.120
and perhaps to dissipate
his embarrassment,

19:58.120 --> 20:01.080
I said,
"Don't be sorry.

20:01.080 --> 20:02.210
I rather enjoyed it."

20:06.120 --> 20:09.030
- What--what happened next?

20:09.030 --> 20:10.230
- Well, he just
stared back at me.

20:10.230 --> 20:14.130
I had obviously shocked him.

20:14.130 --> 20:17.100
But he had an expression,

20:17.100 --> 20:21.230
almost as if he were
titillated a little as well.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.190
And, oh,
I don't know.

20:26.190 --> 20:28.130
Maybe because the hour was late

20:28.130 --> 20:31.030
and my senses were fried,

20:31.030 --> 20:34.150
or--or it was
just the dare in me.

20:34.150 --> 20:38.150
I said, "It's not
the worst thing in life

20:38.150 --> 20:41.130
to be touched, you know?"

20:44.140 --> 20:49.030
And I reached out my hand.

20:49.030 --> 20:52.000
I touched him

20:52.000 --> 20:57.070
and said,
"Not so bad, is it?"

21:00.110 --> 21:01.110
- And then?

21:01.110 --> 21:05.070
- And then, uh,

21:05.070 --> 21:08.090
at the risk
of sounding immodest,

21:08.090 --> 21:13.160
I gave him the best fellatio
known to mankind.

21:24.220 --> 21:26.140
I am sorry to be so blunt,

21:26.140 --> 21:29.160
but I think we all know
what can happen

21:29.160 --> 21:32.180
if you don't come clean
at a deposition.

21:44.020 --> 21:45.060
- No prints on the knife.

21:45.060 --> 21:46.120
DNA was positive.

21:46.120 --> 21:47.220
It's Susan Robin's blood.

21:47.220 --> 21:49.110
- Great.

21:49.110 --> 21:51.070
- I think Vogelman
needs independent counsel.

21:51.070 --> 21:52.070
- For now--

21:52.070 --> 21:53.070
- What if we need to argue

21:53.070 --> 21:54.080
he put the knife in here?

21:54.080 --> 21:55.090
My money says we will.

21:55.090 --> 21:56.150
- Let's just see how

21:56.150 --> 21:58.030
the suppression hearing
goes on Ellenor.

21:58.030 --> 22:00.090
If we win there,
there won't be any conflict.

22:03.140 --> 22:05.220
You all set?
- Yep.

22:05.220 --> 22:08.110
- Do you need any help
on any research or--

22:08.110 --> 22:10.200
- I'm fine.

22:10.200 --> 22:12.130
- Lindsay,
it's a good case to take.

22:12.130 --> 22:14.220
If a judge hires you,
that's a nice feather.

22:14.220 --> 22:16.070
- It's under seal, Bobby.

22:16.070 --> 22:18.050
There's no marquee value
in this case.

22:18.050 --> 22:20.220
There was no reason to take it.

22:20.220 --> 22:22.080
Or was there?

22:22.080 --> 22:24.090
- Oh, please,
you can't be jealous.

22:24.090 --> 22:25.160
- Bobby,
let me just concentrate

22:25.160 --> 22:27.170
on Ellenor's case
right now, okay?

22:30.020 --> 22:31.220
- Your Honor.
- Am I early?

22:31.220 --> 22:34.180
- No, uh--no, we're set to go
in about 20 minutes,

22:34.180 --> 22:36.140
and Bobby wanted
to go over some stuff.

22:36.140 --> 22:38.150
- Do you perhaps have something
I could just nibble?

22:38.150 --> 22:40.210
Oh, hello.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.230
- Hello.

22:41.230 --> 22:42.230
Could I get by?

22:42.230 --> 22:45.130
- Oh, terribly sorry.

22:45.130 --> 22:47.120
- I'll be down as soon as I can.

22:58.030 --> 22:59.210
- I don't mean to add pressure,

22:59.210 --> 23:02.090
but if we don't win this,
Ellenor faces a long haul.

23:02.090 --> 23:03.220
- I know.

23:03.220 --> 23:06.110
Do you have any idea
how that knife got there?

23:06.110 --> 23:08.190
- It had to be George.

23:12.010 --> 23:13.190
BOBBY: You never
showed him the letter?

23:13.190 --> 23:16.230
- Not before I sent it out.

23:16.230 --> 23:18.190
I suppose I should have.

23:18.190 --> 23:21.220
This isn't about
that letter, Bobby.

23:21.220 --> 23:23.080
You read it.

23:23.080 --> 23:25.030
It may not have been
laced with superlatives,

23:25.030 --> 23:26.170
but it certainly
wasn't critical.

23:26.170 --> 23:30.190
- Well, he's suing you
for it, so--

23:30.190 --> 23:33.220
- My bet is, he's suing
just for the privilege

23:33.220 --> 23:35.230
of these depositions.

23:35.230 --> 23:39.120
He gets to be in the same room
with me again.

23:39.120 --> 23:41.220
I don't think he's over me,
to tell you the truth.

23:47.100 --> 23:49.170
Is everything okay?

23:49.170 --> 23:50.150
- Fine.

23:56.040 --> 23:57.220
- They had no warrant
to search that desk.

23:57.220 --> 23:59.060
- And nor is one required.

23:59.060 --> 24:00.170
It was a search
incident to an arrest.

24:00.170 --> 24:03.090
Warrantless searches--
- Hold on a second.

24:03.090 --> 24:06.220
Are you saying the arrest
of Ms. Frutt was invalid?

24:06.220 --> 24:08.060
- On the knife,
absolutely.

24:08.060 --> 24:10.020
- Not on the knife.
On the drugs.

24:10.020 --> 24:11.130
- That case was dismissed.

24:11.130 --> 24:13.040
- I understand,
but are you saying

24:13.040 --> 24:15.210
at the time the arrest was made,
it was legally invalid?

24:15.210 --> 24:17.230
- Yes, they knew
those drugs weren't hers.

24:17.230 --> 24:20.150
- The heroin
was on her desk, Counsel.

24:20.150 --> 24:22.180
There was no probable cause
for an arrest?

24:22.180 --> 24:24.110
- They came in chasing
somebody else for those drugs.

24:24.110 --> 24:25.220
He ran right to this desk.

24:25.220 --> 24:27.080
They see the drugs
on top of the desk.

24:27.080 --> 24:28.230
They suddenly think
they belong to her.

24:28.230 --> 24:31.010
Please, that insults
everybody's intelligence.

24:31.010 --> 24:32.230
- Which is why the case
on the drugs

24:32.230 --> 24:34.230
was ultimately dismissed.

24:34.230 --> 24:37.210
But if the arrest was
technically valid at the time,

24:37.210 --> 24:40.030
then so was the search
that turned up the knife.

24:40.030 --> 24:41.190
- Even if you were
to uphold the search

24:41.190 --> 24:44.180
as incident to a valid arrest,
the area to be searched

24:44.180 --> 24:47.000
has to be within the control
of the suspect.

24:47.000 --> 24:49.020
- Which this was.
It was her desk.

24:49.020 --> 24:50.050
- She wasn't
even in the building

24:50.050 --> 24:51.170
by the time you found the knife,

24:51.170 --> 24:53.100
so the desk couldn't be
within her control.

24:53.100 --> 24:55.030
- The search
began contemporaneously

24:55.030 --> 24:56.030
with the arrest.

24:56.030 --> 24:57.120
It continued after she left.

24:57.120 --> 24:59.060
It did not begin after she left.

24:59.060 --> 25:00.150
There's a difference,
Your Honor.

25:00.150 --> 25:01.130
I can cite the cases.

25:01.130 --> 25:03.000
- None of those cases

25:03.000 --> 25:05.070
involved a pretext arrest,
which this was.

25:05.070 --> 25:06.150
They knew the drugs
weren't hers.

25:06.150 --> 25:07.160
They didn't have
a good-faith basis

25:07.160 --> 25:08.230
to make that arrest.

25:08.230 --> 25:10.050
Any search
incident to that arrest

25:10.050 --> 25:12.100
is also lacking in good faith.

25:12.100 --> 25:15.090
This is part of a master plan
to get George Vogelman,

25:15.090 --> 25:17.020
and everybody
in this room knows it.

25:17.020 --> 25:18.100
- Objection!
- Make your objection,

25:18.100 --> 25:19.200
but I am putting this
on the record.

25:19.200 --> 25:21.020
They charge her with murder,

25:21.020 --> 25:22.170
and they offer
to drop everything

25:22.170 --> 25:24.170
if she would flip
George Vogelman on concealment.

25:24.170 --> 25:26.080
He's the one they're after.

25:26.080 --> 25:28.060
The arrest of Ellenor Frutt
is not only unethical,

25:28.060 --> 25:29.170
it is flat-out immoral.

25:29.170 --> 25:31.040
- I completely reject that!

25:31.040 --> 25:33.030
We never offered to drop this,

25:33.030 --> 25:35.210
and any and all settlement
discussions are inadmissible.

25:35.210 --> 25:37.120
She should be sanctioned

25:37.120 --> 25:39.080
for attempting to raise this
in these proceedings.

25:39.080 --> 25:42.000
- You're charging her with
homicide to coerce testimony!

25:42.000 --> 25:43.140
- Not only to mention
that she misrepresented

25:43.140 --> 25:45.090
everything I said in the context
of our prior discussion!

25:45.090 --> 25:46.080
- All right!
All right!

25:48.210 --> 25:52.170
I'll take all this
under advisement.

25:52.170 --> 25:54.090
I'll rule tomorrow.

25:54.090 --> 25:55.210
- Your Honor, I would ask
that you release Ms. Frutt

25:55.210 --> 25:59.190
on her own recognizance
pending your decision.

25:59.190 --> 26:01.130
- I can live with that.

26:01.130 --> 26:03.130
O.R.

26:03.130 --> 26:05.160
Adjourn till tomorrow.

26:18.220 --> 26:19.230
- You can go.

26:19.230 --> 26:21.080
Your case has been dismissed.

26:21.080 --> 26:24.000
- Thank you, God.

26:24.000 --> 26:26.010
- You're the only one to catch
a break this week, Leonard.

26:26.010 --> 26:27.110
You know that heroin you bought?

26:27.110 --> 26:28.230
Lab results show
it wasn't heroin.

26:28.230 --> 26:32.030
It was some brown confectionery
or something.

26:32.030 --> 26:33.130
That's how gone you are,
Leonard.

26:33.130 --> 26:37.030
Even the deal is--
- I can go now?

26:37.030 --> 26:38.190
- Right now.
- Good.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.190
Not a second too soon.

26:39.190 --> 26:41.040
I need a fix.

26:41.040 --> 26:42.160
- You know,

26:42.160 --> 26:45.020
I can't stop you
from going to get your fix,

26:45.020 --> 26:47.220
but don't you ever
come into our office again

26:47.220 --> 26:50.120
and bring that stuff.

26:50.120 --> 26:52.070
Ellenor Frutt is in
a lot of trouble right now

26:52.070 --> 26:53.070
because of you.

26:58.230 --> 27:02.030
- By your own admission,
this affair was consensual.

27:02.030 --> 27:04.210
- Yes, but I feel
that after it ended,

27:04.210 --> 27:07.130
this letter was not
a ringing endorsement.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.030
That was clear
to anybody who read it.

27:09.030 --> 27:10.130
- Well, did it
say anything negative?

27:10.130 --> 27:12.180
- No, but it wasn't glowing.

27:12.180 --> 27:15.150
I think it's what she didn't say
that was conspicuous.

27:15.150 --> 27:19.050
- Is it possible that you
weren't that great a clerk?

27:19.050 --> 27:23.090
- It's possible, but...
- But what?

27:23.090 --> 27:25.170
- Well, I don't think
she had the opportunity

27:25.170 --> 27:28.100
to really know whether
I was a good clerk or not.

27:28.100 --> 27:29.230
- And why is that?

27:29.230 --> 27:32.030
- Well, once our personal
relationship began,

27:32.030 --> 27:35.030
the only thing that transpired
in her chambers was sex.

27:35.030 --> 27:38.000
Uh, over the last seven months,

27:38.000 --> 27:41.060
we probably made love
two to three times a day,

27:41.060 --> 27:43.090
sometimes four.

27:43.090 --> 27:46.020
- Four times in one day?

27:46.020 --> 27:48.030
- One day,
I think we hit 11.

27:48.030 --> 27:51.170
She was insatiable.

27:51.170 --> 27:53.150
- Are you claiming
that in any way

27:53.150 --> 27:55.140
it was against your will?

27:55.140 --> 27:58.050
- No, no, it was
the most amazing--

27:58.050 --> 27:59.230
look, I didn't complain,

27:59.230 --> 28:01.170
and if she tried
to seduce me again today,

28:01.170 --> 28:03.070
I can't honestly say

28:03.070 --> 28:08.010
that she wouldn't succeed,
knowing how--

28:08.010 --> 28:10.220
Look, my point is,
is that what chance did I have

28:10.220 --> 28:15.130
to excel at being a clerk,
when all we did was--

28:15.130 --> 28:17.170
- Mr. Michaels,
why did you ask her

28:17.170 --> 28:20.180
to write a recommendation
in the first place?

28:20.180 --> 28:22.030
- It was probably a mistake.

28:22.030 --> 28:24.060
I just figured--
I don't know.

28:24.060 --> 28:26.180
I mean, if a woman
can't get enough of your penis,

28:26.180 --> 28:29.080
chances are,
she'll write a decent letter.

28:29.080 --> 28:32.220
- Um, can we go
off the record here a second?

28:35.000 --> 28:37.110
Kevin,
I will write you

28:37.110 --> 28:40.020
a superlative recommendation
right now.

28:40.020 --> 28:41.090
Make a call or two,

28:41.090 --> 28:44.070
I could get you a job
in a second.

28:44.070 --> 28:45.230
How about I do that?

28:45.230 --> 28:49.110
Can we call off this lawsuit?

28:49.110 --> 28:50.110
- It's a little late.

28:50.110 --> 28:52.140
- No, it isn't.

28:55.110 --> 28:58.170
This isn't about
you getting a job, Kevin.

28:58.170 --> 29:01.080
It's about getting me.

29:01.080 --> 29:03.120
- Excuse me?

29:03.120 --> 29:04.170
- You're obsessed with me.

29:04.170 --> 29:07.230
Does your lawyer not know that?

29:09.140 --> 29:10.160
- You're sad.

29:10.160 --> 29:14.090
- Am I?

29:14.090 --> 29:17.090
I could give you an erection
from across the room.

29:17.090 --> 29:18.230
We both know that.

29:21.210 --> 29:23.000
Go ahead.
Stand over there.

29:23.000 --> 29:25.110
I'll prove it.

29:25.110 --> 29:28.160
You're probably
getting aroused right now.

29:31.010 --> 29:33.170
Stand up, Kevin.

29:39.050 --> 29:40.140
- Hey.

29:40.140 --> 29:42.170
Let's just go
back on the record.

29:51.230 --> 29:53.140
WOMAN: All rise.

30:00.060 --> 30:02.000
Be seated.

30:08.130 --> 30:11.000
- A man gets chased
into an office.

30:11.000 --> 30:12.100
Leads to a search.

30:12.100 --> 30:15.030
Turns up a knife.

30:15.030 --> 30:19.160
Somebody somewhere has an idea
as to what's going on here,

30:19.160 --> 30:21.070
but it isn't me.

30:21.070 --> 30:24.100
The search of
the desk drawer was valid.

30:24.100 --> 30:26.100
As far as the murder charge,

30:26.100 --> 30:28.050
possession of a weapon alone,

30:28.050 --> 30:30.000
doesn't constitute
probable cause,

30:30.000 --> 30:32.050
at least not to me
under these circumstances.

30:32.050 --> 30:34.030
That count is dismissed.

30:34.030 --> 30:35.180
As far as the charges

30:35.180 --> 30:38.230
of concealing evidence
and obstruction of justice,

30:38.230 --> 30:41.010
those counts stand.

30:41.010 --> 30:44.230
The defendant is bound over
for trial personal recognizance.

30:44.230 --> 30:49.110
We'll conference
Tuesday, 10:00.

30:49.110 --> 30:51.040
Adjourned.

30:51.040 --> 30:53.020
MAN: Ms. Frutt.
Ms. Frutt!

30:53.020 --> 30:55.180
Did you help George Vogelman
get away with murder?

30:55.180 --> 30:57.190
WOMAN: Do you know
who killed Susan Robin, ma'am?

30:57.190 --> 30:59.020
BOBBY: Come on, let us through.

30:59.020 --> 31:01.140
MAN: Where did
the knife come from?

31:01.140 --> 31:02.170
Just answer a few questions.

31:02.170 --> 31:04.170
WOMAN: Tell us something!

31:16.010 --> 31:17.170
- We'll beat it, Ellenor.

31:17.170 --> 31:20.000
Every one of us is on it.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.090
If we have to drop
every other case

31:21.090 --> 31:23.050
to fight this, it's done.

31:23.050 --> 31:25.000
- As of right now,
George Vogelman is the enemy.

31:25.000 --> 31:26.120
- Why?

31:26.120 --> 31:27.210
- Because one
of the alternative defenses

31:27.210 --> 31:29.210
will have to be
he planted that knife.

31:29.210 --> 31:32.000
- Which is possible, by the way.
- No it isn't.

31:32.000 --> 31:34.180
BOBBY: Ellenor, look at me.

31:34.180 --> 31:36.130
Everyone in this room

31:36.130 --> 31:40.200
stands ready
to go to war for you,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.150
but you have to let us.

31:56.180 --> 31:58.100
- Here's the deal, George.

31:58.100 --> 32:00.110
The police seem determined
to put you on trial again

32:00.110 --> 32:01.150
for killing Susan Robin.

32:05.060 --> 32:07.160
- But how can they?

32:07.160 --> 32:09.050
I was acquitted.

32:09.050 --> 32:10.180
- Well, they're gonna
end-run double jeopardy

32:10.180 --> 32:12.210
with concealment,
obstruction of justice, perjury.

32:12.210 --> 32:14.020
And relevant
to proving the case,

32:14.020 --> 32:15.150
the question as to whether

32:15.150 --> 32:17.160
you committed murder
will be played out again.

32:17.160 --> 32:21.030
And if you get convicted
on perjury and concealment,

32:21.030 --> 32:23.130
the judge is going to take
everything into consideration

32:23.130 --> 32:26.030
when he sentences you.

32:26.030 --> 32:27.200
- What are you telling me?

32:27.200 --> 32:29.020
- I'm telling you,

32:29.020 --> 32:33.120
you could be
looking at 20 years.

32:33.120 --> 32:38.150
- This--this isn't fair.

32:38.150 --> 32:41.200
- No, it isn't,
and it doesn't get better.

32:41.200 --> 32:43.070
You need to get
another attorney.

32:43.070 --> 32:45.060
Our firm withdraws.

32:45.060 --> 32:48.110
Your new lawyer can contact us,
and we'll release the files.

32:56.060 --> 32:57.130
- Jimmy, in my office.

32:57.130 --> 32:59.000
Everybody else
in the conference room.

32:59.000 --> 33:00.060
Your Honor.

33:00.060 --> 33:01.070
- Oh, hello.

33:01.070 --> 33:02.090
I'm Roberta Kittleson.

33:02.090 --> 33:04.110
- Lindsay Dole.
- Yes, I know.

33:04.110 --> 33:06.070
You have quite a reputation
at the courthouse.

33:06.070 --> 33:09.040
- So do you.

33:09.040 --> 33:10.130
- You can go in.

33:10.130 --> 33:12.110
- Excuse me.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.190
- Pretty simple.

33:22.190 --> 33:25.070
$10,000
and a better recommendation,

33:25.070 --> 33:26.170
and we close it today.

33:26.170 --> 33:28.060
- Why should I give him money?

33:28.060 --> 33:29.150
- 'Cause he's looking
to save face,

33:29.150 --> 33:31.070
and it goes away now.

33:31.070 --> 33:33.150
Marriage aside,
this will look bad for you

33:33.150 --> 33:35.110
if it goes public.

33:35.110 --> 33:36.210
Let's keep it sealed
and be done.

33:36.210 --> 33:38.080
Can I tell him yes?

33:38.080 --> 33:39.210
- I suppose.
- Great.

33:39.210 --> 33:41.150
I'll draft some papers,
have you sign them--

33:41.150 --> 33:45.070
- Bobby.

33:45.070 --> 33:48.110
Thank you.

33:48.110 --> 33:50.090
- I'll be in touch.

33:58.190 --> 34:00.230
- You know,
this is a really good result.

34:00.230 --> 34:03.030
We put this out in a day.
Good result.

34:03.030 --> 34:06.130
- Yes, and thank you too,
Jimmy.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.090
- Listen,
maybe you want to get

34:10.090 --> 34:12.050
a glass of champagne later?

34:12.050 --> 34:15.179
Toast our victory?

34:15.179 --> 34:18.100
- Oh, would you like
to do that?

34:20.010 --> 34:23.100
- Well, only if you would.

34:24.139 --> 34:27.080
- Sure.

34:27.080 --> 34:28.060
- Good.

34:29.170 --> 34:31.010
- There are two possibilities:

34:31.010 --> 34:32.070
somebody's out to frame
George Vogelman,

34:32.070 --> 34:33.130
or he's guilty.

34:33.130 --> 34:34.210
- If George were guilty,
why would he

34:34.210 --> 34:36.030
put the murder weapon
in my drawer?

34:36.030 --> 34:37.080
What good does that do him?

34:37.080 --> 34:38.139
- Well, if he's guilty,
Ellenor,

34:38.139 --> 34:40.010
we can forget
what makes sense.

34:40.010 --> 34:41.170
He cut off a head.

34:41.170 --> 34:43.090
- Plus, this could be
some fixation thing with you.

34:43.090 --> 34:44.170
- What?
- Loner.

34:44.170 --> 34:45.170
Perhaps once in love with you.

34:45.170 --> 34:47.040
You dumped him.

34:47.040 --> 34:48.219
I mean, maybe
when he first cut off the head,

34:48.219 --> 34:50.230
he brought it to you like a cat
showing off a dead mouse.

34:50.230 --> 34:52.230
- Oh, come on!
- Ellenor.

34:52.230 --> 34:54.070
If he's sick, he's sick.

34:54.070 --> 34:55.199
- But why the knife
in the drawer?

34:55.199 --> 34:57.060
- I don't know,
to keep things alive?

34:57.060 --> 34:58.130
To keep a connection
with Ellenor maybe?

34:58.130 --> 34:59.220
- That doesn't seem--

34:59.220 --> 35:01.200
- Obsessed people
do crazy things, Bobby.

35:01.200 --> 35:04.140
- Look, let's all admit
we don't know George Vogelman,

35:04.140 --> 35:06.080
but he's exactly the profile.

35:06.080 --> 35:08.010
Nice guy
delivering mail one day,

35:08.010 --> 35:09.200
walks into McDonald's the next.

35:09.200 --> 35:11.170
- That isn't George.
- Then who, Ellenor?

35:11.170 --> 35:13.070
This doesn't make sense.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.210
- Look, we figured
he was set up the first time.

35:14.210 --> 35:16.180
If someone could put a head
in his medical bag,

35:16.180 --> 35:18.150
maybe they're doing the same
thing again with the knife.

35:18.150 --> 35:20.130
- If somebody wanted
to frame George with the knife,

35:20.130 --> 35:22.150
it would have turned up
before he was acquitted.

35:22.150 --> 35:23.150
Why hold the knife back?

35:23.150 --> 35:25.070
How stupid would that be?

35:25.070 --> 35:26.200
- Maybe they didn't have
the knife at first.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.050
- Didn't have it?

35:28.050 --> 35:29.170
If he was set up
with the head in the bag,

35:29.170 --> 35:31.020
it would have had to have been
by the killer,

35:31.020 --> 35:33.000
who would also have the knife.

35:33.000 --> 35:35.050
- This just doesn't make sense.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.120
- It's the police.

35:48.120 --> 35:51.180
The knife turned up
after the trial,

35:51.180 --> 35:53.120
and because of double jeopardy,
the only way

35:53.120 --> 35:55.220
to make use of it
was to plant it here

35:55.220 --> 35:58.210
and set up a perjury
obstruction of justice charge.

35:58.210 --> 36:00.060
- That's a bit of a reach.

36:00.060 --> 36:03.030
- This trial embarrassed them,

36:03.030 --> 36:04.170
and just like Eugene
and Helen said,

36:04.170 --> 36:06.170
there is a mission
to get George.

36:11.170 --> 36:14.110
And I know how they did it.

36:14.110 --> 36:18.080
- I don't--I don't know
what you're talking about.

36:18.080 --> 36:20.050
- Yes you do, Leonard.

36:20.050 --> 36:22.000
See, what didn't make sense,

36:22.000 --> 36:24.090
nobody buying heroin,

36:24.090 --> 36:26.130
especially someone
so experienced as you,

36:26.130 --> 36:29.090
is gonna walk off
with sugar.

36:29.090 --> 36:31.170
The reason it was sugar
is so the case against you

36:31.170 --> 36:33.010
would eventually get dropped,

36:33.010 --> 36:35.060
which you seemed
to see coming,

36:35.060 --> 36:36.230
something that also
confused me a little

36:36.230 --> 36:38.160
when I--when I
went to your cell

36:38.160 --> 36:39.220
and said you could go.

36:39.220 --> 36:41.150
You weren't surprised.

36:41.150 --> 36:44.220
The police sent you running
in there to drop that bag

36:44.220 --> 36:47.110
to allow them
to search Ellenor's desk,

36:47.110 --> 36:49.070
where the knife
was planted then,

36:49.070 --> 36:51.230
or some time before.

36:51.230 --> 36:53.220
- Leonard?

36:53.220 --> 36:55.220
Is that what happened?

36:55.220 --> 36:58.030
The police sent you
running into my office?

37:00.030 --> 37:01.210
- Leonard.

37:01.210 --> 37:04.020
You're not gonna get arrested
or prosecuted on this

37:04.020 --> 37:05.140
if you tell us the truth.

37:05.140 --> 37:07.100
I guarantee it.

37:07.100 --> 37:09.010
Police misconduct, coercion.

37:09.010 --> 37:11.090
Trust me,
they can't touch you,

37:11.090 --> 37:14.000
but if you don't
tell us the truth,

37:14.000 --> 37:16.040
if you go along with the police
trying to frame Ellenor,

37:16.040 --> 37:18.000
a person who has been
very good to you,

37:18.000 --> 37:19.100
a person who has
been saving your ass

37:19.100 --> 37:21.000
for the last ten years,

37:21.000 --> 37:26.120
if you don't come clean
with what went down,

37:26.120 --> 37:28.120
I will hurt you.

37:35.030 --> 37:37.100
- They caught me
with some stuff again,

37:37.100 --> 37:40.150
said if I do this,
they'd let me go.

37:45.030 --> 37:47.010
I'm sorry, Ellenor.

37:51.130 --> 37:54.200
I'm afraid of prison.

38:00.170 --> 38:02.030
- So far it appears to be

38:02.030 --> 38:05.020

group of officers.

38:05.020 --> 38:07.070
We've arrested three uniforms

38:07.070 --> 38:09.050
and two lieutenants
in forensics.

38:09.050 --> 38:10.070

38:10.070 --> 38:12.000
- It's unconfirmed,

38:12.000 --> 38:14.090
but the weapon was evidently
found in an abandoned car.

at this point.

38:16.050 --> 38:17.140

- That's my understanding.

I would like to stress,
this does not represent

38:22.230 --> 38:24.210
the Boston Police Department.

38:24.210 --> 38:28.130

are a disgrace to the force.

will be conducting

38:30.160 --> 38:32.210

Thank you.

38:40.020 --> 38:41.120

be so brazen

38:41.120 --> 38:43.130
to think they wouldn't
get caught?

38:43.130 --> 38:45.070

- Figured they had a weak link
in our chain with Leonard.

39:05.190 --> 39:07.190

he politely declined.

Of course,
he could still be guilty.
