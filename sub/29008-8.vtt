00:06.040 --> 00:08.360
SCRAPYARD CLOSED
NO TRESPASSING

00:09.840 --> 00:11.360
"That Sunday, Raquel Murillo missed

00:11.440 --> 00:14.040
for just a few seconds,
the chance to see the Professor’s face.

00:16.400 --> 00:19.240
And that was the last face needed
to complete the jigsaw puzzle

00:19.320 --> 00:22.240
of the kidnappers
and move to the last part of the case.

00:23.760 --> 00:25.280
She already had Rio’s face.

00:25.560 --> 00:26.480
Mine.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.840
She was about to have Berlin’s.

00:30.680 --> 00:33.960
The Professor had anticipated that Raquel
would eventually get those photos.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.120
Like a pack of cards
he was sorting out little by little

00:37.200 --> 00:39.200
so the Inspector
was busy playing with the cards.

00:39.280 --> 00:41.880
His face had to be the only one
she would never obtain.

00:43.880 --> 00:46.480
But he wasn’t so anonymous, so unknown.

00:46.560 --> 00:50.840
His face was going to start being drawn
like a hologram in the police protocols.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.720
The loose end had left him
at very high risk.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.840
And now, if the Inspector
played her cards right

00:58.920 --> 01:01.760
and obtained the Professor’s face,
the game would be over.

01:04.240 --> 01:06.040
Checkmate would be irreversible."

02:14.640 --> 02:17.160
SUNDAY
12:06 AM

02:18.160 --> 02:19.880
-"Alison Parker.
-Are you sure?

02:19.960 --> 02:22.760
Do you prefer saving Alison Parker’s life
to eight people’s lives?

02:23.120 --> 02:24.000
Yes, I’m sure.

02:24.080 --> 02:26.120
How coldblooded she can be,
she didn’t hesitate.

02:26.200 --> 02:29.200
When someone is capable of making
a decision that way, unhesitatingly,

02:29.280 --> 02:30.720
one is speechless."

02:43.160 --> 02:45.800
50 HOURS INTO THE ROBBERY

02:46.400 --> 02:48.280
"That the life of eight Spanish teenagers

02:48.360 --> 02:51.640
is less worth than the life
of an English girl is outrageous.

02:51.840 --> 02:54.240
Alison Parker is Spanish,
she has dual nationality.

02:54.320 --> 02:56.680
Taking into account
that the main thing is the hostages,

02:56.760 --> 02:59.560
we should think carefully
about Inspector Murillo’s role.

02:59.640 --> 03:02.840
I don't think she is ready
for a matter of this calibre.

03:02.920 --> 03:05.720
She’s had an extensive career
in the police force.

03:05.800 --> 03:08.480
A psychologist, a criminologist...
What more could you ask for?

03:08.560 --> 03:09.640
She has vast experience.

03:09.720 --> 03:12.760
The problem right now is
that Inspector Raquel Murillo

03:12.840 --> 03:15.080
has just pressed charges
for physical abuse."

03:15.160 --> 03:17.240
-Paula!
-"What’s this got to do with...?

03:17.400 --> 03:21.040
It has to do from the point of view
of her being emotionally affected.

03:21.120 --> 03:24.120
Probably, she’s under medication,
she’s unstable..."

03:24.600 --> 03:26.440
She has just talked to her father.

03:27.520 --> 03:32.240
Paula, love, Why don’t you tell mummy
what daddy told you?

03:32.400 --> 03:33.280
Come on.

03:34.040 --> 03:36.440
If I want to live
with him and with my aunt.

03:38.480 --> 03:40.320
And what did you say, darling?

03:40.840 --> 03:41.720
That I will.

03:45.280 --> 03:48.720
Darling, but you know
that if you move in with your dad,

03:48.880 --> 03:53.160
-we’ll see much less of each other.
-The same as now. You’re never home.

03:55.920 --> 03:57.120
Look, Paula.

03:59.120 --> 04:02.000
Mum doesn’t want you to move in
with your dad because...

04:03.160 --> 04:06.880
Because your dad isn’t good
and has hurt me a lot. You understand?

04:07.480 --> 04:08.720
Dad is good.

04:09.360 --> 04:11.360
No, darling, your dad isn’t good.

04:11.920 --> 04:13.560
That’s not true, dad told me.

04:14.600 --> 04:18.640
He told her that it’s a lie. I mean,
that you go round talking nonsense.

04:20.520 --> 04:23.840
-I want to live with my aunt.
-But, honey.

04:24.720 --> 04:27.680
Look, your aunt Marta is a knucklehead.

04:28.360 --> 04:30.920
I shouldn’t be saying this
because I’m her mum too.

04:31.280 --> 04:34.600
But her head is made of rag,
like your rabbit Eugenio.

04:34.680 --> 04:35.600
Mum.

04:36.040 --> 04:38.960
Enough. Don’t turn the child
against her aunt, please.

04:39.200 --> 04:40.160
Fine.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.840
Look, darling,
You know what we’re going to do?

04:45.080 --> 04:47.520
We’re going out for a hamburger.
Would you like that?

04:48.720 --> 04:49.800
With ketchup?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.640
With ketchup with fries.

04:53.000 --> 04:57.680
And when I finish this job,
we’re going to the Canaries.

04:57.760 --> 05:00.360
To the beach, a girls’ plan. Fancy that?

05:01.160 --> 05:03.640
If it’s a girls’ plan, I’m in.

05:03.720 --> 05:04.880
Come on, let’s go.

05:05.120 --> 05:07.160
And chocolate ice cream too.

05:07.240 --> 05:10.080
Chocolate ice cream, all right.
You want chocolate ice cream.

05:18.880 --> 05:21.600
"The questions about this heist,
which put us on tenterhooks,

05:21.680 --> 05:22.600
are accumulating.

05:22.680 --> 05:25.840
Who are the kidnappers?
Is their plan to stay inside?

05:26.040 --> 05:29.360
Do they want money or to protest
against financial institutions?

05:29.680 --> 05:34.080
How long can they stay in there
without the police deciding to go in?"

05:36.040 --> 05:37.640
Why won’t the police go in?

05:37.720 --> 05:39.880
Because we’re going
to lock the door from inside.

05:41.080 --> 05:42.320
See how she gets pissed.

05:43.520 --> 05:45.040
They won’t come in...

05:47.280 --> 05:49.240
because no one in Spain will want them to.

05:49.800 --> 05:51.800
Do you think
they’re going to hold a referendum?

05:55.880 --> 05:57.320
-Okay.
-Let’s see.

05:57.800 --> 05:58.720
Year 2011.

05:59.480 --> 06:02.520
A group of young people
start to occupy the Puerta del Sol,

06:02.600 --> 06:04.760
the most emblematic square
in the whole of Spain.

06:04.840 --> 06:07.080
And more than 20,000 people
end up gathering there.

06:07.160 --> 06:08.520
15-M, no?

06:09.400 --> 06:10.560
That’s the one.

06:11.440 --> 06:13.600
If we had been told, any of us,

06:13.760 --> 06:16.360
that 20,000 people would camp

06:16.440 --> 06:19.600
on the Puerta del Sol for a month
and no police officers were going in,

06:20.400 --> 06:23.560
we would have never believed it.
We’d have said that it’s impossible.

06:24.960 --> 06:26.000
But it was that way.

06:26.920 --> 06:28.280
And the police didn’t go in.

06:30.080 --> 06:30.960
Why?

06:34.640 --> 06:37.080
Because Spain as a whole
stood by those youngsters.

06:39.120 --> 06:43.040
Right. But those youngsters had tents
and we have guns.

06:43.120 --> 06:44.960
-Somehow different.
-That’s true.

06:45.080 --> 06:47.360
But politics is politics.

06:48.480 --> 06:50.080
Money is money, isn’t it?

06:51.080 --> 06:52.640
Sangria is sangria.

06:53.800 --> 06:56.480
No, no, in Serbia,
because of this, police come in.

06:58.800 --> 07:02.520
-"Yibeli", friends.
-Don’t do that! "Yibili, yibili."

07:02.600 --> 07:03.760
Man! What a pig!

07:04.600 --> 07:08.800
We’ll be the Resistance trapped

07:08.960 --> 07:10.000
in this rat hole

07:10.920 --> 07:14.240
the same way they were
the Puerta del Sol Resistance.

07:16.720 --> 07:18.760
And Resistance always has
people’s support.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.560
-And if that doesn’t work...
-You have your own audience, don’t you?

07:25.760 --> 07:28.000
No, sorry, go on, go on.

07:29.480 --> 07:30.360
Thank you.

07:31.920 --> 07:33.600
If that doesn’t work,

07:34.040 --> 07:36.440
the police will know we have
assault weapons,

07:36.600 --> 07:38.680
will know we have explosives.

07:39.120 --> 07:41.240
No elite unit
will be able to tell the difference

07:41.320 --> 07:42.720
between hostages and robbers.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.960
No Home minister will order the entry,
no one.

07:47.040 --> 07:48.120
Why not?

07:50.240 --> 07:51.720
Because there are underage people.

07:58.600 --> 08:00.320
SPANIARDS, SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS

08:03.640 --> 08:07.600
Choosing Alison Parker’s life over those
eight adolescents’ life was your decision.

08:08.040 --> 08:10.560
You told me that the Intelligence Service
would assume the consequences.

08:11.120 --> 08:14.040
Go out there
and tell the press that it was you

08:14.200 --> 08:15.400
and your friends in CNI.

08:15.480 --> 08:18.200
The Intelligence Service
cannot make those statements.

08:18.960 --> 08:20.000
But don’t worry.

08:20.600 --> 08:23.640
The President’s Office is aware of this.
You have full support from the Government.

08:24.480 --> 08:28.160
Look, I couldn’t care less
about the Government’s support.

08:28.560 --> 08:31.040
I care about
what my daughter and my mother think

08:31.800 --> 08:33.280
and not what the President thinks.

08:33.400 --> 08:37.520
Inspector, it was never those people's
intention to release Alison Parker

08:37.600 --> 08:38.840
nor the eight underage people.

08:39.360 --> 08:40.800
It’s a trap.

08:41.800 --> 08:43.760
If you allow me, I’ll tell you one thing.

08:44.760 --> 08:47.520
When this is over,
no one will remember it.

08:48.880 --> 08:49.760
It’s...

08:50.760 --> 08:51.840
It’s like Spain’s football team.

08:51.920 --> 08:53.000
It doesn’t matter how they do

08:53.080 --> 08:54.840
at the beginning of
the World Championship.

08:54.920 --> 08:59.080
If you finally get them a happy ending,
you’ll be the country’s hero.

09:00.240 --> 09:02.560
If it ends up in a long string
of dead people,

09:02.880 --> 09:04.920
we’ll be screwed up... all of us.

09:07.240 --> 09:08.840
I’m sorry for my mistakes.

09:09.600 --> 09:11.560
And you can fully count on me.

09:13.200 --> 09:14.800
But if you want me to quit...

09:20.640 --> 09:23.800
Suárez, I want everyone working.

09:24.800 --> 09:27.520
I want the forensic tests results
on the Seat Ibiza now.

09:27.600 --> 09:30.720
And the report from the Underground Unit.
Where is that report, hum?

09:32.400 --> 09:34.760
And, above all, Mr Prieto,

09:35.280 --> 09:36.520
I want the Intelligence Service

09:36.600 --> 09:39.440
to tell me how the hell
those robbers are going to come out.

09:48.640 --> 09:50.040
I have a question, Professor.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.640
How are we coming out of there?

09:55.600 --> 09:58.000
-Through a tunnel.
-That’s your master plan?

09:58.080 --> 10:00.440
The police will find that out
in a couple of minutes.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.800
Yes.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.000
Look.

10:14.040 --> 10:17.000
This is the Fábrica Nacional
de Moneda y Timbre

10:17.160 --> 10:18.800
seen from above.

10:20.560 --> 10:22.040
As soon as you enter,

10:22.640 --> 10:25.600
you will make the hostages
break the rocks, right here.

10:26.120 --> 10:27.600
In the boiler room in the basement.

10:28.480 --> 10:31.960
It’s exactly 13 metres
from the sewage system.

10:34.600 --> 10:35.480
13 metres?

10:37.920 --> 10:41.320
At that distance,
any GPR system would detect us,

10:42.120 --> 10:43.000
wouldn’t it?

10:44.800 --> 10:45.840
True.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.680
A GPR system has a 15-metre range.

10:51.280 --> 10:53.080
Or instead, they will use a seismograph

10:53.160 --> 10:55.200
that will detect
the vibration from the jackhammer.

10:57.280 --> 10:59.400
So, they’ll think
we’ll be escaping through here.

11:01.320 --> 11:03.440
But we’re not going to leave
through there, are we?

11:05.840 --> 11:06.720
No.

11:09.120 --> 11:10.800
We’ll exit through another tunnel.

11:11.120 --> 11:12.160
A tunnel...

11:13.680 --> 11:15.360
that they won’t be able to see.

11:16.440 --> 11:19.480
Because it is 26 metres
from any other drain

11:19.640 --> 11:22.720
and, mainly, because it’s already there.

11:22.960 --> 11:25.880
We just need to make a hole in order to
open it from here,

11:25.960 --> 11:27.360
from vault number three.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.120
Who made that tunnel?

11:34.280 --> 11:36.600
-I had it built five years ago.
-No...

11:37.720 --> 11:41.040
Once you make the hole
to connect the tunnel to the factory,

11:41.640 --> 11:44.480
you’ll find 486 metres...

11:44.800 --> 11:46.560
already excavated to...

11:47.760 --> 11:48.680
a hangar

11:51.880 --> 11:53.200
that has already been prepared.

11:55.920 --> 11:56.800
No.

11:58.360 --> 12:00.680
-I take my hat off before you.
-And your knickers.

12:02.760 --> 12:04.040
But all the surveillance cameras...

12:05.960 --> 12:08.640
the ground has also been sealed,
hasn’t it?

12:09.720 --> 12:10.600
That’s right.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.400
There’s a first layer made of steel
and a second one of reinforced concrete.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.680
Besides, no pneumatic drill
can be used there.

12:19.320 --> 12:21.920
It has to be done by hand,
thermal lance, and circular saw.

12:22.000 --> 12:22.960
How many metres?

12:26.040 --> 12:28.240
16 centimetres of steel.

12:30.000 --> 12:32.200
80 centimetres of reinforced concrete.

12:34.160 --> 12:35.480
Finally, soil.

12:36.720 --> 12:38.600
Six metres seventy, in total.

12:39.040 --> 12:40.880
-It’s a hell of...
-A good hole.

12:40.960 --> 12:42.680
Hey, And...

12:43.640 --> 12:47.080
how long will it take you
to make that hole?

12:51.320 --> 12:53.120
10, 12 days.

12:54.320 --> 12:56.040
The time we’ll be inside here.

12:56.600 --> 12:57.600
Say around...

12:58.920 --> 13:02.720
200 million euros printed per day.

13:03.200 --> 13:07.960
2,400 million.

13:08.040 --> 13:09.680
Yes!

13:11.320 --> 13:12.840
-Come on!
-Professor!

13:12.920 --> 13:16.000
The CSI has confirmed
traces of ammonia and alcohol

13:16.080 --> 13:18.520
on the dashboard, upholstery, windows.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.280
That is, the whole car.

13:22.040 --> 13:24.520
"The lab’s chemical report revels
that those products were used"

13:24.680 --> 13:26.400
a few minutes just before we got there.

13:26.920 --> 13:29.720
What makes us believe
that someone related to the gang

13:29.800 --> 13:31.720
was there almost at the same time as us.

13:34.640 --> 13:37.400
-"What about the homeless man?
-No trace of him."

13:38.080 --> 13:40.280
We have viewed
the traffic surveillance cameras

13:40.480 --> 13:42.760
and shops nearby, but nothing.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.680
"However, there is some good news."

13:44.920 --> 13:48.480
They were able to isolate one finger print
on the button you found inside the Ibiza.

13:52.760 --> 13:55.840
"The owner has previous charges.
They are sending us the file."

13:58.640 --> 14:00.280
Attention, listen up everyone.

14:00.960 --> 14:03.280
I need you to leave the tent
for a few minutes.

14:04.320 --> 14:06.880
Everyone, except Detective Rubio.

14:07.920 --> 14:10.400
It’ll only take a few minutes.
Thank you very much.

14:10.640 --> 14:11.520
Thank you.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.880
And except the CNI.

14:27.960 --> 14:29.800
Could it be a coincidence that the guy,

14:29.960 --> 14:32.280
"the homeless man,
got to the wreck yard before we did?

14:32.720 --> 14:34.400
No, it wasn’t a coincidence."

14:36.800 --> 14:38.240
There is mole amongst us.

14:40.320 --> 14:42.000
What are we going to do about it?

14:43.600 --> 14:44.720
Find him.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.400
The police file is here.

15:22.600 --> 15:23.640
Relax.

15:23.960 --> 15:25.000
Relax.

15:26.080 --> 15:27.200
Everything is okay.

15:27.960 --> 15:28.880
Relax.

15:29.400 --> 15:30.520
You rest.

15:34.920 --> 15:35.840
Stay still.

15:37.040 --> 15:38.160
Relax.

15:50.040 --> 15:51.360
Everything is okay.

15:52.000 --> 15:53.400
Everything is okay.

16:15.600 --> 16:16.800
I’ll be right back.

16:32.760 --> 16:33.640
It’s okay.

16:34.000 --> 16:36.160
No infection. Good.

16:38.560 --> 16:39.560
Very good.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.720
37.6.

16:49.120 --> 16:50.200
There’s no problem.

16:50.560 --> 16:53.040
40, a problem.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.080
37.6, no problem.

16:58.240 --> 17:00.920
Me, in the war, look after many men.

17:01.600 --> 17:03.120
Man looks after man.

17:05.880 --> 17:06.920
No problem.

17:07.600 --> 17:09.240
Everything is fine.

17:10.360 --> 17:12.080
Everything is fine.

17:36.040 --> 17:37.080
Mónica.

17:42.640 --> 17:44.080
Mónica, hey.

17:51.160 --> 17:52.280
How are you feeling?

17:54.840 --> 17:55.720
Better.

17:57.600 --> 17:58.720
What are you doing here?

17:59.680 --> 18:02.680
It’s my sleep turn, but I just wanted
to know how you were doing.

18:08.160 --> 18:09.560
It’s hot in here, huh?

18:09.880 --> 18:10.760
Yes.

18:12.280 --> 18:14.200
It feels as if there wasn’t enough oxygen.

18:15.400 --> 18:17.880
If you want, you can rest here, I’m fine.

18:18.040 --> 18:20.000
I’m fine just sitting down
for a little bit.

18:20.160 --> 18:21.040
Fine.

18:44.600 --> 18:46.000
Yes. Yes, yes.

19:02.760 --> 19:04.240
Andrés de Fonollosa.

19:05.360 --> 19:07.040
He has a detention warrant.

19:08.040 --> 19:11.000
Jewellery shops, vans, auction houses.

19:11.720 --> 19:13.200
White collar thefts.

19:14.240 --> 19:17.000
No exit stamps in his electronic passport.

19:17.560 --> 19:19.160
Most probably he has a fake one.

19:19.240 --> 19:21.720
No record of any family or friends either.

19:21.800 --> 19:24.000
The regular informants
don’t know who he is.

19:24.800 --> 19:27.440
No address,
he isn’t on any census or registry.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.720
"I can only think of talking
to his cell mate.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.920
They shared the same cell
in Soto del Real prison.

19:34.760 --> 19:37.600
Do that. Start the paperwork
to bring him into the tent."

19:37.680 --> 19:38.840
Wait, wait."

19:39.000 --> 19:40.720
That’s not everything.
The interesting thing comes

19:40.800 --> 19:43.120
from the forensic psychiatry department.
Shall I read it to you?

19:46.760 --> 19:49.440
We are before a narcissist, egocentric...

19:51.040 --> 19:52.960
"with delusions of grandeur."

19:55.520 --> 19:57.920
I’ve gathered you here to tell you

19:58.080 --> 20:00.640
a little about how things are going on.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.920
And to put an end to some rumours.

20:03.160 --> 20:05.400
He shows an absolute lack of empathy.

20:05.560 --> 20:10.000
Rumour has it, Ms. Mónica Gaztambide

20:10.960 --> 20:13.560
has passed away. This rumour is not good.

20:14.040 --> 20:15.520
Rumours create...

20:16.360 --> 20:17.480
uncertainty,

20:18.000 --> 20:19.040
anxiety.

20:20.120 --> 20:22.280
That's why
I would like to explain it all.

20:24.720 --> 20:28.560
It is true, Ms. Mónica,
your colleague, has been executed.

20:30.280 --> 20:33.960
"An eccentric man, with tendency
to megalomania which makes him unable"

20:34.120 --> 20:35.960
to differentiate evil from good.

20:38.080 --> 20:39.720
But I also want to...

20:40.600 --> 20:42.920
share with you some other news.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.400
Good news.

20:45.000 --> 20:46.960
Because the truth...

20:47.560 --> 20:50.360
is that this heist...
is going very smoothly,

20:51.600 --> 20:52.920
on the fast track.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.320
"He has a great sense of honour"

20:55.760 --> 20:59.440
and he has a pathological need
to make a good impression.

21:00.280 --> 21:02.480
Especially, on strangers.

21:05.720 --> 21:07.000
Therefore, I want to...

21:08.520 --> 21:10.920
thank you, I must thank

21:11.240 --> 21:16.000
all of you who... are doing your best

21:16.560 --> 21:20.080
and collaborating. Especially, one person.

21:21.360 --> 21:22.560
Mr. Torres.

21:24.880 --> 21:25.760
Mr. Torres.

21:33.000 --> 21:34.000
Paco.

21:34.720 --> 21:35.680
Paquito.

21:37.040 --> 21:38.160
Paquito.

21:38.920 --> 21:41.960
Mr Francisco Torres.

21:42.400 --> 21:47.080
This gentleman
has been printing banknotes for 27 years.

21:47.400 --> 21:49.600
And today,
today he’s beaten his own record.

21:49.680 --> 21:52.880
Because, after 40 hours, he’s printed...

21:52.960 --> 21:54.760
Tell us how much money you have printed.

21:55.120 --> 21:57.160
311 million euros.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.720
Say it louder, with pride,
For everyone to hear it.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.680
311 million.

22:02.160 --> 22:05.840
311 million euros!

22:06.000 --> 22:08.960
311 million euros.

22:10.640 --> 22:11.840
He, alone!

22:12.160 --> 22:14.640
Well, with my colleagues’ help, that is.

22:15.160 --> 22:18.400
He’s also a humble man.
Thank you, Mr. Torres, thank you.

22:18.760 --> 22:20.360
Thank you everyone.

22:20.720 --> 22:23.040
Mr. Torres, do you know what you are?

22:23.120 --> 22:27.720
You are the fucking hostage of the month.

22:27.800 --> 22:30.880
Yes, let’s give him the round of applause
he deserves.

22:31.120 --> 22:32.680
For Mr. Torres!

22:35.440 --> 22:36.520
Come on!

22:36.720 --> 22:39.600
Come on, so he can see
how fond of him we are!

22:40.400 --> 22:41.840
You are a champion.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.880
-So he can feel it.
-Thank you!

22:52.960 --> 22:55.360
And now some more good news,

22:56.560 --> 22:58.080
I would like you to welcome...

22:59.560 --> 23:00.560
how he deserves,

23:02.040 --> 23:05.320
and a big round of applause
that he will never forget,

23:06.560 --> 23:07.520
Mr Arturo.

23:08.560 --> 23:11.800
The CEO, who is finally out of danger!

23:34.680 --> 23:35.800
Thank you, Paco.

23:47.440 --> 23:49.600
Can I have a word with you in private,
please?

24:17.080 --> 24:20.160
I want you to leak everything you can
about this individual to the press.

24:21.440 --> 24:22.440
What for?

24:23.320 --> 24:24.440
-What for?
-Yes.

24:25.360 --> 24:27.440
That bloke is turning this
into a fucking show.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.000
As if he were in a film.

24:29.160 --> 24:31.040
Let’s see what Spain thinks about him now

24:31.120 --> 24:33.240
when everyone sees
that an eccentric is holding

24:33.400 --> 24:35.160
-a lot of adolescents hostage.
-Raquel.

24:36.720 --> 24:38.400
I doubt you’ll win
the people’s opinion over

24:38.480 --> 24:41.080
by saying that the kidnappers’ leader
is an eccentric.

24:41.680 --> 24:43.640
"This country loves eccentric people.

24:44.400 --> 24:45.760
You’ll need more."

24:49.960 --> 24:51.240
Trafficking in women.

24:52.200 --> 24:54.440
An unsolved pimping case.

24:55.200 --> 24:56.880
"Something people can’t forgive."

25:00.080 --> 25:04.040
Don’t do it. Raquel, don’t do it,
don’t be so low, don’t do it.

25:12.720 --> 25:14.800
Leak it. A pimp.

25:15.160 --> 25:17.840
In an on-going investigation
for trafficking in women

25:17.920 --> 25:20.800
from east European countries,
some of them, underage girls.

25:21.720 --> 25:24.000
"Released for collaborating
with the police.

25:24.400 --> 25:25.800
On top of that, a snitch.

25:27.120 --> 25:28.440
I like your style."

25:29.080 --> 25:31.200
I’m going to the agency
to prepare everything.

25:35.760 --> 25:38.360
-Listen. No, listen to me, Raquel.

25:39.480 --> 25:42.680
Are you sure about this, aren’t you?
We’re going to defame a person.

25:43.520 --> 25:44.560
Defame a person?

25:44.640 --> 25:45.760
-Yes.
-Yes?

25:46.320 --> 25:49.280
Look, Ángel, my name is on TV talk shows,

25:49.360 --> 25:52.600
in the international press
as the biggest bitch.

25:53.120 --> 25:55.720
And, casually, my ex-husband
has taken this opportunity,

25:55.800 --> 25:59.720
at this time of glory to ask my daughter
if she wants to move in with him.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.080
Do you know what that means?

26:05.800 --> 26:08.120
He’s going to sue me
for sole custody of my daughter,

26:08.440 --> 26:10.640
that he’ll speak to a judge to tell him:

26:10.720 --> 26:13.120
"Your honour, that bitch
is not fit to raise my daughter."

26:14.120 --> 26:16.280
"'And, besides,
the kid wants to live with me'.

26:16.480 --> 26:18.960
Hey, hey, no judge will grant him
sole custody"

26:19.040 --> 26:23.240
-not to someone who physically abused you.
-But not even my mother believes me...

26:23.520 --> 26:26.640
-Do you think a judge will believe me?
-I believe you, Raquel.

26:27.640 --> 26:28.680
I believe you.

26:30.520 --> 26:32.000
I can testify for you.

26:34.240 --> 26:35.480
-Testify?
-Yes.

26:35.560 --> 26:36.800
What will you testify?

26:36.960 --> 26:38.600
-You haven’t witnessed anything.
-What the hell!

26:38.680 --> 26:41.800
Aren’t we going to defame Fonollosa?
Here, everyone defames everyone.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.720
Damn! Your husband, the first.

26:46.880 --> 26:50.040
So, I say that... I saw the bruises.

26:51.680 --> 26:53.760
That is, underneath your mini skirt, huh?

26:55.880 --> 26:57.680
But I never wear a mini skirt, Ángel.

26:57.840 --> 26:59.120
It’s the same, for god’s sake.

27:00.640 --> 27:04.680
And, at the same time, I can testify about
that night we spent in the mountains.

27:06.920 --> 27:09.280
Again, it wasn’t in Cercedilla,
it was in Miraflores.

27:23.160 --> 27:24.200
"Excuse me, Inspector."

27:24.960 --> 27:25.840
Can I come in?

27:26.720 --> 27:27.720
What’s the matter?

27:28.040 --> 27:30.800
We come from the wreck yard.
We have questioned the Russian man.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.560
"Nikolai Dimitrevich, the guard.

27:36.280 --> 27:39.480
A man asked about his car
an hour before you arrived."

27:39.840 --> 27:43.400
He spoke Russian to him.
According to the person’s description,

27:43.480 --> 27:46.600
"this man could be the same person
who spoke with Almansa.

27:46.680 --> 27:47.680
The homeless man."

27:48.280 --> 27:49.520
Bring in the Russian man.

27:50.280 --> 27:52.760
"He can look through the files
of delinquents from eastern Europe."

27:53.280 --> 27:54.480
And I want a sketch.

28:04.520 --> 28:08.440
"I want all the files of all the Russians
who have been questioned,

28:08.600 --> 28:10.000
arrested or accused, okay?"

28:10.160 --> 28:13.720
There is software that helps draw up
a sketch here in the tent.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.080
"The image of the Professor was so unknown

28:17.240 --> 28:19.360
like an undone jigsaw puzzle
of 1,000 pieces.

28:20.240 --> 28:22.720
But a witness was going to put
all the pieces together.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.080
And Raquel, who had never believed
in sketches,

28:28.280 --> 28:30.840
was going to have the key
to the whole investigation."

28:38.200 --> 28:39.080
Fuck.

28:54.640 --> 28:55.640
Jessica.

28:57.080 --> 28:58.080
Elena.

28:58.720 --> 29:00.200
Denise.

29:01.280 --> 29:02.200
Paula.

29:02.720 --> 29:03.800
Elisabeth.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.080
Aurora.

29:05.800 --> 29:06.680
And Alison.

29:10.520 --> 29:12.200
I’m sorry I tied you up so tightly.

29:15.680 --> 29:18.160
But, damn, you also stuck a rifle
to my head.

29:18.400 --> 29:19.880
What did you expect me to do?

29:20.480 --> 29:23.240
Despite being the ambassador’s daughter,
you’re a bit rebellious, aren’t you?

29:24.360 --> 29:27.120
Not really, it was the second crazy thing
I’ve done in my life.

29:27.320 --> 29:29.400
Ah, was it? And which was the first one?

29:29.640 --> 29:31.880
Taking ballet lessons behind
my father’s back.

29:32.040 --> 29:33.520
Blimey, what a crazy thing to do!

29:33.600 --> 29:36.600
Watch out, you start by dancing
and end up involved in some fishy stuff,

29:36.680 --> 29:38.840
say the violin.
And later, going to a rave.

29:45.400 --> 29:47.760
My father has chosen everything for me.

29:48.520 --> 29:50.320
The school, the university studies...

29:51.360 --> 29:52.680
Even the house where I’ll study

29:52.760 --> 29:54.880
the postgraduate degree
in Diplomacy in Oxford.

29:55.240 --> 29:58.000
"Alison, this piece of cutlery
is for fish.

29:58.080 --> 29:59.440
Alison, not that glass.

29:59.560 --> 30:02.160
Alison, you will sign up for chess."

30:03.680 --> 30:04.800
And the same for everything.

30:06.800 --> 30:07.680
Obviously.

30:08.440 --> 30:10.720
And to piss him off,
you take up ballet dancing.

30:12.200 --> 30:15.120
I chose ballet dancing
because my father hates ballet.

30:15.560 --> 30:17.360
And volley ball was on Saturdays.

30:17.920 --> 30:21.160
And on Saturdays I can’t do anything
without him knowing.

30:25.200 --> 30:26.200
Fine.

30:26.720 --> 30:29.360
Take your toiletry bag
and up you go in a line.

30:45.400 --> 30:46.480
What were you talking about?

30:47.720 --> 30:48.680
Nothing.

30:51.240 --> 30:52.480
Something about Oxford.

30:53.800 --> 30:54.880
I heard you.

30:55.400 --> 30:58.600
No, about my life.
About my father being bossy.

31:01.800 --> 31:03.320
Are you inviting him to the embassy?

31:04.160 --> 31:05.040
Who?

31:06.240 --> 31:07.120
Rio.

31:07.960 --> 31:08.840
No.

31:10.360 --> 31:11.520
Don’t you like my boyfriend?

31:13.160 --> 31:14.040
No.

31:17.640 --> 31:19.200
I love his smile.

31:20.520 --> 31:21.520
Don’t you?

31:25.080 --> 31:25.960
No.

31:27.760 --> 31:30.320
I’ve seen you looking at him,
why are you lying to me?

31:42.520 --> 31:43.880
Rio is cute, isn’t he?

31:46.720 --> 31:47.640
Yes, well.

31:48.840 --> 31:50.200
You see? You like him.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.400
It’s fine, admit it.

31:56.240 --> 31:57.120
Yes, I do.

31:57.720 --> 31:59.120
Yes, he’s with me.

32:01.200 --> 32:03.040
But I’m not a fierce bitch

32:03.320 --> 32:05.440
that goes around biting
when she feels insecure.

32:13.920 --> 32:15.240
If you like playing,

32:16.320 --> 32:18.200
we’ll all have to play, won’t we?

33:01.640 --> 33:02.520
Off you go.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.800
How long have you been in there?

33:35.760 --> 33:37.760
Three sexual assaults,

33:40.160 --> 33:44.080
six intoxications with narcotics,
exhibitionism...

33:44.560 --> 33:47.800
A total of 38 years in prison

33:48.120 --> 33:50.200
and still pending for trial, true?

33:54.840 --> 33:56.520
What did you bring me in here for?

34:02.520 --> 34:04.200
You shared the same cell with this man.

34:06.160 --> 34:07.840
Do you remember who he had contact with?

34:09.920 --> 34:10.800
With no one.

34:10.960 --> 34:13.280
Fine, but he must have some relatives.

34:14.120 --> 34:15.000
Girlfriend.

34:15.280 --> 34:16.920
-Partner.
-I don’t know.

34:17.480 --> 34:18.360
Friends.

34:19.280 --> 34:20.360
He didn’t mention.

34:20.760 --> 34:24.200
Are you telling me that
he didn’t mention anyone in seven months?

34:28.720 --> 34:29.680
What's the matter?

34:31.920 --> 34:33.240
She asked what the matter is.

34:34.360 --> 34:35.840
Did he say anything about his home?

34:36.080 --> 34:37.240
-No.
-No?

34:37.760 --> 34:39.720
His neighbourhood, his home town,
I don’t know,

34:40.240 --> 34:42.240
somewhere
he was thinking of going back to.

34:42.720 --> 34:44.240
I don’t know, he didn’t say anything.

34:44.560 --> 34:47.680
I think you don’t quite understand
how this works.

34:50.760 --> 34:52.600
I need you to tell me something.

34:53.320 --> 34:54.200
Do you understand?

34:54.640 --> 34:55.840
A clue to help us.

34:56.920 --> 34:57.880
Think, please.

35:01.240 --> 35:02.120
There’s something.

35:02.920 --> 35:03.800
What?

35:04.840 --> 35:06.800
I won’t tell you for nothing in return.

35:07.400 --> 35:08.920
I’ve been in prison for four years.

35:09.600 --> 35:11.520
-I need something in return.
-Sure.

35:11.600 --> 35:13.080
Let’s see, don’t piss me off.

35:13.160 --> 35:15.040
-Ángel.
-This isn’t a film. No, no.

35:15.120 --> 35:18.800
You tell us something and then, well,
we’ll see, we’ll come to some arrangement.

35:18.880 --> 35:21.000
You start talking
and I’ll give you a candy.

35:21.080 --> 35:22.640
-Did you hear me?
-Ángel, Ángel!

35:24.840 --> 35:25.720
Relax.

35:28.680 --> 35:29.560
Look here.

35:31.600 --> 35:33.240
I’ll sign a form requesting

35:33.320 --> 35:35.720
the board of Soto
for you to be released on parole.

35:36.400 --> 35:37.800
But under two conditions.

35:38.480 --> 35:40.800
The first one is
that you give us the information now.

35:41.320 --> 35:44.360
If the information is good,
I’ll tell you the second condition.

35:44.680 --> 35:47.320
But you have my word
that I’ll obtain the parole for you.

35:49.880 --> 35:52.760
He used to inject himself
with some medicine each day.

35:53.360 --> 35:57.520
I have his infirmary records here, but...
it doesn’t mention any medical condition.

35:58.080 --> 35:59.280
Yes, I know.

36:00.040 --> 36:01.760
It was something he kept as a secret.

36:02.720 --> 36:04.080
Something degenerative.

36:04.480 --> 36:06.440
Do you remember the name of the medicine?

36:07.040 --> 36:08.080
Retroxil.

36:08.240 --> 36:09.440
How did he obtain it?

36:09.800 --> 36:11.280
I don’t know if you are aware

36:11.360 --> 36:13.680
that in the prison it’s very easy
to smuggle anything in.

36:14.960 --> 36:16.440
Inside your anal cavity.

36:20.960 --> 36:23.200
And now tell me
what’s the second condition.

36:25.560 --> 36:29.360
That you volunteer to undergo
a chemical castration treatment.

36:31.480 --> 36:34.960
As soon as you ask for it, I’ll sign
the form to be released on parole.

36:35.360 --> 36:36.480
-No?
-No.

36:36.960 --> 36:38.520
Suárez, take him away.

36:40.000 --> 36:41.800
-Come on.
-You gave me your word.

36:42.160 --> 36:44.040
-You fucking bitch!
-Come on.

36:46.520 --> 36:48.600
Find out what Retroxil is used for.

36:48.760 --> 36:50.320
Track any strange purchasing patterns

36:50.400 --> 36:52.680
in all the pharmacies
during the last six months.

36:53.800 --> 36:55.800
If that guy injected himself with that
every day,

36:55.960 --> 36:58.800
"he had to get himself
a big stash before going in."

36:59.840 --> 37:00.720
Only you.

37:03.320 --> 37:05.560
We can’t trust anyone
before we find the mole.

37:05.880 --> 37:06.760
All right.

37:10.280 --> 37:12.040
I brought the Russian guy in, Inspector.

37:12.440 --> 37:13.320
Nikolai.

37:14.840 --> 37:18.520
I sent for you so you can identify
the man from this morning,

37:18.600 --> 37:19.680
in the wreck yard.

37:21.160 --> 37:22.960
Do you think you could recognize his face?

37:24.320 --> 37:25.800
Can you do a sketch?

37:26.560 --> 37:27.600
Perfectly.

37:28.200 --> 37:29.080
Ángel.

37:29.600 --> 37:32.160
"Tell the others they can come back in.
Come with me."

37:41.680 --> 37:42.560
Look...

37:43.840 --> 37:46.440
I’m very concerned about my pupil, Silvia.

37:46.920 --> 37:48.120
Because she is...

37:49.600 --> 37:51.320
a particularly fragile girl.

37:52.920 --> 37:56.160
And I think she
would feel much more protected

37:56.240 --> 37:58.800
with the rest of the group, do you know?
With her mates.

37:59.840 --> 38:03.560
What subject do you teach
in the school, miss?

38:05.840 --> 38:07.280
-Me?
-Yes.

38:07.960 --> 38:09.120
I teach...

38:09.720 --> 38:11.960
-Philosophy, Ethics.
-Philosophy?

38:12.320 --> 38:13.760
-Yes.
-How nice.

38:14.440 --> 38:16.200
History of religions.

38:16.880 --> 38:20.400
-And... Well, some workshops.
-What kind of workshops?

38:22.640 --> 38:25.160
About environment, sexual education.

38:29.960 --> 38:31.720
What an important task, isn’t it?

38:35.640 --> 38:37.120
And as you’re an expert,

38:38.200 --> 38:40.960
you may be able to help me
to solve a problem

38:41.040 --> 38:44.240
I have about sexuality. You see...

38:44.920 --> 38:48.160
Actually, I would like
to explain my theory to you.

38:55.480 --> 38:56.360
May I?

38:58.320 --> 38:59.200
Yes, sure.

38:59.880 --> 39:00.760
Tell me.

39:02.800 --> 39:04.480
I came up with it because of jokes.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.680
Jokes.

39:08.680 --> 39:09.800
Jokes.

39:12.640 --> 39:15.080
You know that for a joke to be funny,

39:15.680 --> 39:17.560
there has to be some truth...

39:18.600 --> 39:19.680
and some pain.

39:20.440 --> 39:22.360
Ah, really? No, I didn’t know.

39:22.440 --> 39:25.600
-How curious.
-Yes. It’s that way.

39:29.200 --> 39:31.840
Do you know the one about the headache?

39:34.840 --> 39:35.720
No.

39:36.880 --> 39:38.280
The husband arrives home.

39:38.560 --> 39:39.440
"Darling,

39:40.200 --> 39:42.080
I brought you an aspirin."

39:42.960 --> 39:45.600
And the wife says:
"But I haven’t got a headache."

39:47.480 --> 39:49.000
"Then let’s fuck."

39:58.520 --> 40:00.120
Have you noticed

40:00.800 --> 40:03.360
the amount of jokes
that portray the male figure

40:03.440 --> 40:07.000
always trying to break down the female
to obtain sex?

40:07.080 --> 40:10.000
And the woman, always forced to it,
as if she didn’t like it.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.680
Do you think that's the truth?

40:16.440 --> 40:19.440
Don’t you have
the same appetite for sex, miss?

40:24.080 --> 40:25.240
I understand we do.

40:27.320 --> 40:29.680
Perhaps, not as frequently,
don't you think?

40:30.520 --> 40:31.400
It could be.

40:32.960 --> 40:35.400
But tell me, Silvia,
can I take her with her...?

40:35.480 --> 40:37.000
Ah, of course, Silvia.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.280
Look, stand up a moment, please.

40:41.120 --> 40:42.120
Come with me.

40:43.320 --> 40:44.200
Come.

40:49.160 --> 40:50.880
Look, there she is, Silvia.

40:52.880 --> 40:54.160
You see how relaxed she is?

40:57.120 --> 40:58.080
Hello!

40:59.600 --> 41:00.560
Hello.

41:01.480 --> 41:02.560
Say hello, miss.

41:03.200 --> 41:05.360
I’m sure that it’ll make
the little girl happy.

41:21.520 --> 41:22.800
What’s the matter, Nairobi?

41:25.520 --> 41:27.040
You are on TV.

41:32.640 --> 41:33.520
Oslo.

41:35.840 --> 41:37.440
It’s been a pleasure, miss.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.200
Come again whenever you want.
We’ll talk about Ethics.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.760
Take her away.

41:45.880 --> 41:46.760
Come with me.

41:57.200 --> 41:58.680
I think this nose.

42:10.840 --> 42:11.840
Almansa.

42:13.920 --> 42:15.520
How is that identikit coming up?

42:15.600 --> 42:17.960
Well, he and I
concur with the same features.

42:18.120 --> 42:20.440
-"We’ll have his face soon.
-Very good."

42:43.080 --> 42:44.920
"Those words made the Professor embark

42:45.000 --> 42:47.240
on something
he had never imagined he would do.

42:49.760 --> 42:51.800
Look for the police to save his own skin."
