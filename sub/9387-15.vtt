TV ANNOUNCER: We now return
to Julia Louis-Dreyfus

00:36.745 --> 00:38.622
in "Now It's Just Getting Sad."

00:38.705 --> 00:40.415
Okay, okay, hear me out.

00:40.499 --> 00:44.336
My character is a therapist
living in the city,

00:44.419 --> 00:47.756
but I'm married to an elephant.

00:47.840 --> 00:49.925
Hi, I'm the husband.
Hey, honey.

00:50.008 --> 00:51.844
We're going to my parents'
this weekend.

00:51.927 --> 00:53.512
Did you pack your trunk?

00:53.595 --> 00:54.763
(canned laughter)

00:54.847 --> 00:56.056
I don't think I want to go.

00:56.139 --> 00:57.391
I don't like going
to your parents.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.642
Why?

00:58.725 --> 01:01.061
Maybe because your dad's
an ivory hunter?

01:01.144 --> 01:03.355
See, there's a lot going on here.
A lot going on.

01:03.438 --> 01:05.357
It actually, it actually
gets pretty watchable.

01:07.317 --> 01:09.069
Ah, damn, it's still raining.

01:09.152 --> 01:10.696
Lois, you mind if I
go in the house?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.573
Fine, fine, just put
the newspaper down.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.456
Hey, Lois, look at this.

01:21.540 --> 01:23.333
The church is holding auditions
for a new organist.

01:23.417 --> 01:24.418
Really?

01:24.501 --> 01:25.544
Wow, you know,
that sounds like

01:25.627 --> 01:27.379
it could be a lot of fun.

01:27.462 --> 01:30.048
Yeah, it's been a while since
you've had the chance to play in public.

01:30.132 --> 01:31.967
Church organist?
Ah, that's boring.

01:32.050 --> 01:33.260
Why don't you do something
more interesting?

01:33.343 --> 01:35.220
Like when I had that job
feeding the homeless.

01:35.304 --> 01:37.764
That's going to make you
big and strong.

01:37.848 --> 01:39.850
Burping time.

01:39.933 --> 01:43.478
Oh, smells like someone
needs to be changed.

01:43.562 --> 01:45.480
When was the last time
you were changed,

01:45.564 --> 01:46.982
seven days ago?

01:47.065 --> 01:48.442
That's one week.

01:48.525 --> 01:50.736
There are seven days in a week.

01:50.819 --> 01:53.197
I love you, filthy hobo.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.536
Huh, huh! All right.

01:59.620 --> 02:01.580
(unzipping, slap):
Ah!

02:01.663 --> 02:03.624
Why do you say "organist"
if you don't want...

02:03.707 --> 02:05.459
I don't understand
the world anymore.

02:09.838 --> 02:13.425
Here be a jaunty sea chantey

All right, up next
is Lois Griffin.

02:50.504 --> 02:52.464
Heh, well, I don't know
if I can compete

02:52.548 --> 02:54.967
with the rest of these people,
but here goes.

02:56.718 --> 03:00.806
(gentle hymn playing)

03:00.889 --> 03:04.434
My word, what a fascinating man
this Jesus must have been.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.894
I can just imagine meeting him.

03:31.837 --> 03:34.339
(organ music continues)

03:36.800 --> 03:38.802
That was beautiful,
Mrs. Griffin.

03:38.886 --> 03:40.554
Up next is Jake Tucker.

03:42.139 --> 03:44.850
(disjointed notes playing)

03:47.644 --> 03:50.439
(playing
"William Tell Overture")

03:56.945 --> 03:58.572
Well, finally!

03:58.655 --> 04:00.199
Some of us have been
waiting all evening

04:00.282 --> 04:01.909
for a certain wife
to come home

04:01.992 --> 04:03.535
and feed her
starving family.

04:03.619 --> 04:05.913
Peter, I told you
I was going to be late.

04:05.996 --> 04:07.080
Couldn't you have
handled dinner?

04:07.164 --> 04:09.208
You can't ask me
to make dinner, Lois.

04:09.291 --> 04:11.627
That's like asking me to choose
between Sarah Jessica Parker

04:11.710 --> 04:14.254
and Kirsten Dunst in a hot
body/weird face contest.

04:14.338 --> 04:15.339
It can't be done.

04:15.422 --> 04:17.299
Well, I've got good news.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.676
I'm going to be
the church's new organist.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.303
Hey, congrats.
Wow, Mom, that's great.

04:21.386 --> 04:23.305
That means
you'll play the organ.

04:23.388 --> 04:25.307
It also means
that this family

04:25.390 --> 04:27.893
is going to start going
to church again on Sundays.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.187
Being there today reminded
me of how important

04:30.270 --> 04:32.856
religious services are to
the moral fiber of a family.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.609
And lately, this family
has been lacking moral fiber.

04:35.692 --> 04:38.278
Especially you, Meg.

04:38.362 --> 04:40.322
Meg, what happened to you?

04:40.405 --> 04:41.949
She can't answer you.

04:42.032 --> 04:43.951
She can't even talk.

04:44.034 --> 04:45.410
Ever since she
started smoking pot,

04:45.494 --> 04:47.538
she just kind of lays there.

04:47.621 --> 04:48.747
It's really sad.

04:48.830 --> 04:50.749
And a tiny bit funny.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.335
Oh, my God, I think
I'm getting a contact high.

04:53.418 --> 04:55.170
Oh, now I'm messed up, too.

04:55.254 --> 04:56.922
(pipe organ plays)

04:59.007 --> 05:00.676
Good morning, everyone.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.595
Please turn to hymn number 387.

05:30.664 --> 05:33.000
A reading from the book of Leviticus.

05:33.083 --> 05:36.920
"Thou shalt not spill thy seed
into thy sock,

05:37.004 --> 05:39.381
"and then cram it
to the bottom of the hamper

05:39.464 --> 05:41.758
"like it's been there a long time."

05:41.842 --> 05:42.843
The Word of the Lord.

05:42.926 --> 05:43.927
ALL:
Praise be to God.

05:44.011 --> 05:45.929
Oh, I am so hungry.

05:46.013 --> 05:47.806
Oh, look, they're handing
out cookies up there.

05:47.890 --> 05:49.016
Stewie, wait, don't...

05:49.099 --> 05:50.184
Hey, there.

05:50.267 --> 05:51.518
Eat up, y'all.

05:51.602 --> 05:53.061
Youse is good
churchgoing folk.

05:53.145 --> 05:55.230
Y'all deserve a little treat.
Give me that!

05:55.314 --> 05:58.233
Well, aren't you an enthusiastic
wafer muncher.

05:58.317 --> 05:59.359
What is that, punch?

05:59.443 --> 06:00.903
Oh, don't y'all
drink that.

06:00.986 --> 06:03.238
Youse gonna get sick.2

06:03.322 --> 06:04.323
Yep.

06:05.657 --> 06:07.910
(gasps):
That baby just threw up the host!

06:07.993 --> 06:09.536
That's a sign
of the devil.

06:09.620 --> 06:10.704
Oh, my God,
is he possessed?

06:10.787 --> 06:11.914
He's possessed!

06:11.997 --> 06:13.665
That baby is
possessed by Satan!

06:13.749 --> 06:16.251
Calm down, everyone.
He's just a little sick.

06:16.335 --> 06:17.794
I'll take him home.
Come on, sweetie.

06:17.878 --> 06:19.922
Oh, sweet, we
are out of here.

06:20.005 --> 06:21.882
Now I can do what I planned
to do this morning--

06:21.965 --> 06:23.884
gladiator mice.

06:23.967 --> 06:27.387
(laughs):
Yes, yes, die, die, die!

06:27.471 --> 06:30.682
I have everything,
and you have nothing!

06:33.018 --> 06:35.521
Ugh, what a horrible morning.

06:35.604 --> 06:37.648
You know, all I wanted
was for us to share

06:37.731 --> 06:39.900
a simple Sunday church service
as a family.

06:39.983 --> 06:41.860
But I guess that's
too much to ask.

06:41.944 --> 06:42.986
(doorbell rings)

06:46.990 --> 06:48.742
Good afternoon, Mrs. Griffin.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.661
We're here to take custody
of your baby

06:50.744 --> 06:53.705
so that the good reverend here
can perform an exorcism

06:53.789 --> 06:56.041
and banish the devil
from his infant soul.

06:56.124 --> 06:59.711
What?! You are not performing
an exorcism on my baby.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.630
Mrs. Griffin,
you can give him to us,

07:01.713 --> 07:03.298
or we can take him
by force.

07:03.382 --> 07:05.175
No!
Don't worry, Lois,

07:05.259 --> 07:07.302
we'll hide in the one place
they can't find us.

07:07.386 --> 07:09.346
In imagination land,

07:09.429 --> 07:10.889
where you burp
where you fart,

07:10.973 --> 07:12.266
and you fart
where you burp.

07:12.349 --> 07:14.226
(burps, farts)

07:14.309 --> 07:16.812
Ha! Indeed, that's
how it happens.

07:19.231 --> 07:21.859
(angry shouting)

07:23.694 --> 07:24.778
Where are we going?

07:24.862 --> 07:26.280
Who cares as long
as it's away

07:26.363 --> 07:27.990
from those bloody
church fanatics.

07:28.073 --> 07:29.616
We're going to Texas.

07:29.700 --> 07:32.661
We can stay at my sister Carol's
place until this blows over.

07:32.744 --> 07:34.705
Texas?
We're going to Texas

07:34.788 --> 07:36.790
in search of religious
tolerance?

07:36.874 --> 07:38.625
That's going to be like trying

is being offered

In other pseudo-

08:37.100 --> 08:39.770
a local man claims
to have spotted bigfoot.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.355
We've got the
exclusive interview.

08:41.438 --> 08:44.900
I was about to bone my
girlfriend out at the lake,

08:44.983 --> 08:47.486
but suddenly she
yelled, so I looked up

08:47.569 --> 08:49.363
and it was bigfoot.

08:49.446 --> 08:50.447
So what happened next?

08:50.531 --> 08:52.449
Then I went back to bone her,

08:52.533 --> 08:54.785
but the mosquitoes
were going crazy,

08:54.868 --> 08:57.538
and she said there was no way.

08:59.623 --> 09:03.085
All right, get your snacks
and hurry out, you guys.

09:03.168 --> 09:05.504
Yeah, look, they
have Chunky bars.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.673
What a God-awful mess
those things are,

09:07.756 --> 09:09.341
chocolate with
raisins in it.

09:09.424 --> 09:12.094
Yeah, yeah, that's what kids want with
their chocolate-- fruit.

09:12.177 --> 09:13.929
Why don't you put
sunflower seeds

09:14.012 --> 09:15.430
in the Ding Dongs
while you're at it?

09:15.514 --> 09:16.890
Is that part
of your stand-up act?

09:16.974 --> 09:18.809
I don't know, do you like it?
I wouldn't open with it.

09:21.562 --> 09:22.980
Pardon me, sir.

09:23.063 --> 09:24.773
We're trying to locate
a possessed child.

09:24.857 --> 09:26.316
Have you seen anyone
who looks like this?

09:26.400 --> 09:27.401
Yeah, that's my son.

09:27.484 --> 09:28.610
He's actually in
the mini-mart right now.

09:28.694 --> 09:30.028
He'll be out in a second.

09:30.112 --> 09:31.738
I-I-I-I mean, I mean no, no.

09:31.822 --> 09:32.948
Never seen him before.

09:33.031 --> 09:35.325
Hmm. What was that
first thing you said?

09:35.409 --> 09:37.661
Oh, I was just saying that baby
in the picture is my son.

09:37.744 --> 09:39.830
He's traveling with us.
He's part of our family.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.291
We're trying to avoid being
found by police like you.

09:42.374 --> 09:46.628
I mean, I was just remarking
what a nice tie you have on.

09:46.712 --> 09:49.298
I love this tie.

09:49.381 --> 09:51.175
All right, you folks
take care now.

09:51.258 --> 09:52.467
(laughing)

09:52.551 --> 09:54.720
Oh, did you hear
that cashier's accent?

09:54.803 --> 09:56.805
(Hindi accent): "Would you like
some change please for you?"

09:56.889 --> 09:58.724
Oh, you know, if it
weren't for 9/11,

09:58.807 --> 09:59.975
those guys would
be adorable.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.059
Oh, my God, look.

10:02.936 --> 10:03.979
Quick, into the bathroom.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.523
We're going to have to
come up with a way

10:06.607 --> 10:08.275
to change your appearance.

10:08.358 --> 10:10.277
Well, I could disguise myself
as Britney Spears.

10:10.360 --> 10:11.904
I'm already
standing in urine,

10:11.987 --> 10:13.405
and I hate the person
I'm with.

10:13.488 --> 10:15.741
No, see, there's got to be
something in here we can use.

10:23.248 --> 10:26.043
(sighs): Boy, that was a close one
back there.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.586
Way to think on your feet,
Brian.

10:27.669 --> 10:28.712
We got lucky.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.047
How you holding up, Stewie?

10:30.130 --> 10:31.715
Um...

10:31.798 --> 10:34.009
I feel right, Brian.

10:34.092 --> 10:35.427
I feel right.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.896
Are you sure Aunt Carol
won't mind us using her house?

10:45.979 --> 10:47.231
She won't care, Chris.

10:47.314 --> 10:48.815
She's off on her
ninth honeymoon.

10:48.899 --> 10:50.359
(laughs)

10:50.442 --> 10:52.444
When will it work for her?

10:53.320 --> 10:54.571
Howdy, new neighbors.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.656
Pleased to welcome you.

10:55.739 --> 10:56.823
We're the Lynches.

10:56.907 --> 10:58.367
We live next door.

10:58.450 --> 10:59.618
Nice to meet you.

10:59.701 --> 11:00.869
We're the Griffins.

11:00.953 --> 11:02.454
Nellie here is a homemaker.

11:02.538 --> 11:04.456
And I'm a queer chaser
and beater.

11:04.540 --> 11:06.959
Lois, I'm not sure this is
the right place for us.

11:07.042 --> 11:09.920
These Texans are socially
backward and politically,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.588
they're all stubborn
as a mule.

11:11.672 --> 11:14.341
Nope, sorry, Kevin Bacon
wasn't in Footloose.

11:14.424 --> 11:15.634
What?
Of course he was.

11:15.717 --> 11:17.386
No, he wasn't.
You lose.

11:17.469 --> 11:18.470
Of course he was,
he was the star.

11:18.554 --> 11:19.680
No, you're wrong.
Look it up.

11:19.763 --> 11:20.764
I don't have
to look it up.

11:20.848 --> 11:21.849
It's common knowledge.
Nope.

11:21.932 --> 11:23.058
He was on the cover of...
Nope. Nope.

11:23.141 --> 11:24.893
People magazine when the movie...
No. No.

11:24.977 --> 11:27.187
Everyone knows Kevin Bacon
was the star of Footloose. No! No! No! No!

11:27.271 --> 11:29.356
It was a huge movie. He was the lead.
No! No! No!

11:29.439 --> 11:30.816
No! No! No! No!

11:30.899 --> 11:33.861
(braying loudly)

11:36.697 --> 11:38.615
Look what
the Lynches gave us.

11:38.699 --> 11:42.244
A needlepoint of Chuck Norris
from Walker, Texas Ranger.

11:42.327 --> 11:44.079
You know, they say
Chuck Norris is so tough

11:44.162 --> 11:46.164
there's no chin under his beard.

11:46.248 --> 11:48.500
There is only another fist.

11:48.584 --> 11:49.918
That's ridiculous.

11:50.002 --> 11:51.712
Chuck Norris?

11:53.172 --> 11:54.965
You know,
this place may be the upside

11:55.048 --> 11:56.925
to everything that's happened.

11:57.009 --> 11:58.594
The people are kind
and generous.

11:58.677 --> 12:00.387
They seem wholesome and moral.

12:00.470 --> 12:03.140
Exactly the kind of influence
this family needs.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.725
Lois, we're living
in a red state

12:04.808 --> 12:06.685
with a bunch
of right-wing nutjobs.

12:06.768 --> 12:08.353
Hey, Chris, check
out my belt buckle.

12:08.437 --> 12:10.772
It says, "Everything's
bigger in Texas."

12:10.856 --> 12:12.274
(laughing)

12:12.357 --> 12:15.527
Belts are a great way
to express opinions.

12:17.696 --> 12:21.074
TV ANNOUNCER: This is Channel Five News,
Texas, with Duke Dillon.

12:21.158 --> 12:23.160
Howdy, Texas. I'm Duke Dillon.

12:23.243 --> 12:24.828
At the top of the news tonight,

12:24.912 --> 12:26.622
authorities have called off
their pursuit

12:26.705 --> 12:28.081
of a fugitive Rhode Island baby

12:28.165 --> 12:30.125
who was thought
to be possessed by the devil.

12:30.209 --> 12:31.710
Oh! Thank God!

12:31.793 --> 12:33.128
This turn of events came

12:33.212 --> 12:35.047
after Vatican scientists
announced today

12:35.130 --> 12:37.883
that the devil is not the
greatest threat to salvation

12:37.966 --> 12:41.053
due to last week's discovery
of the Superdevil.

12:41.136 --> 12:43.388
Religion reporter Dallas Houston
has the story.

12:43.472 --> 12:45.474
Thanks, Duke. Well, let me try
and give you a clear picture

12:45.557 --> 12:47.267
of what we're dealing with here.

12:47.351 --> 12:50.103
Here's a photo of the devil,
and here's the Superdevil.

12:50.187 --> 12:52.439
Now, as you can see, there are
some significant differences.

12:52.523 --> 12:55.317
The Superdevil
is at least six inches taller,

12:55.400 --> 12:58.403
he has a flying motorcycle
and a jar of marmalade

12:58.487 --> 13:00.656
that we believe forces you
to commit adultery.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.032
Thanks a lot, Dallas.

13:02.115 --> 13:04.701
Looks like we all got something
new to be afraid of.

13:04.785 --> 13:06.620
Everyone, it's over!

13:06.703 --> 13:08.622
We can go back to Quahog.

13:11.708 --> 13:13.710
Hey, Lois, you say something?

13:13.794 --> 13:16.755
Aw, just that I think
you're going to love this cake.

13:16.839 --> 13:18.131
None for me, thanks.

13:18.215 --> 13:19.967
It's going to go
straight to my vagina.

13:20.050 --> 13:21.468
That's what girls
worry about, right,

13:21.552 --> 13:22.553
having big vaginas?

13:27.015 --> 13:29.059
Dad, why aren't
you taking the car?

13:29.142 --> 13:30.727
Chris, we're in Texas now.

13:30.811 --> 13:32.646
If I'm not riding a horse,
I'm gonna stick out

13:32.729 --> 13:34.857
like a straight guy
in a figure-skating competition.

13:37.276 --> 13:39.778
Boo-ya!
Triple Salchow in your face!

13:39.862 --> 13:42.155
Hey, you want this? Huh?
You want some of this?

13:42.239 --> 13:43.866
Oh, man, look at your rack.

13:43.949 --> 13:45.242
I'd motorboat that.

13:45.325 --> 13:46.702
I'd motorboat the hell
out of it!

13:46.785 --> 13:48.495
Right after this layback spin.

13:53.333 --> 13:55.377
Bottle of Jack Daniels, please.

13:55.460 --> 13:57.004
There you go.
Thanks.

13:57.087 --> 13:58.088
What's this?

13:58.172 --> 13:59.173
That's your gun.

13:59.256 --> 14:01.175
Buy some liquor,
get a free gun.

14:01.258 --> 14:03.468
Is that like a special
you have on now or something?

14:03.552 --> 14:05.429
Nope. Texas state law.

14:05.512 --> 14:07.764
You have a nice day now.
State law?

14:07.848 --> 14:10.684
God! This place officially sucks
worse than the WNBA.

14:12.269 --> 14:15.230
And, at the top
of the second half, it's 16 to nine.

14:15.314 --> 14:17.065
Easton leads the
scoring with four.

14:17.149 --> 14:20.277
And that's why
she commands $7,000 a year.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.696
These gals sure do
make it look difficult.

14:22.779 --> 14:26.241
But is having this minor skill
worth being so unattractive?

14:26.325 --> 14:28.076
That's for the fan to decide.

14:28.160 --> 14:29.411
Yay!

14:32.122 --> 14:33.415
(gunshot)

14:34.249 --> 14:37.169
Huh. That was kind of cool.

14:37.252 --> 14:40.047
(gunshots)

14:45.344 --> 14:47.054
(yawning):
Been a long day, Lois.

14:47.137 --> 14:48.472
Long day.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.640
Peter, what the hell?

14:49.723 --> 14:51.850
You can't bring that
horse into our bed.

14:51.934 --> 14:53.227
Lois, I cannot believe

14:53.310 --> 14:54.937
you would ban the
horse from our bed.

14:55.020 --> 14:56.897
He is a graceful,
majestic creature

14:56.980 --> 14:58.482
who is a part
of this family

14:58.565 --> 14:59.900
and only wants you
to love and respect...

14:59.983 --> 15:01.360
The horse may have
pooped in the bed.

15:04.571 --> 15:06.365
I hereby call this meeting

15:06.448 --> 15:08.450
of the Texas Youth Club
to order.

15:08.534 --> 15:11.119
First, I'd like to welcome
our two newcomers,

15:11.203 --> 15:12.871
Chris and Meg Griffin.

15:12.955 --> 15:16.124
Wow! This is the coolest club
I've ever been in.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.377
Well, you're not quite
in the club yet.

15:18.460 --> 15:20.003
You got to pass
the initiation.

15:20.087 --> 15:21.630
What do we have to do?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.590
You got to sneak
on to the Crawford Ranch

15:23.674 --> 15:25.926
and steal a pair
of George Bush's underwear.

15:26.009 --> 15:27.302
And then bring it back here

15:27.386 --> 15:30.138
so we can bask in
its Bushy goodness.

15:30.222 --> 15:31.723
Boy, that's even kinkier

15:31.807 --> 15:34.017
than the porn they make
for senior citizens.

15:35.310 --> 15:37.563
Can I help you, Edward?

15:37.646 --> 15:40.107
Yeah. I'm here
for the early bird special.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.860
Are those new slacks?
(funky music begins playing)

15:42.943 --> 15:44.194
What's that, now?

15:44.278 --> 15:46.446
Are those new slacks?

15:46.530 --> 15:49.116
I got these
on special at Caldors.

15:49.199 --> 15:50.826
Who drove you there?

15:50.909 --> 15:52.035
My nephew.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.329
Oh. That was nice of him.

15:54.413 --> 15:57.207
I forgot why I came over.

15:57.291 --> 15:59.835
Are those new slacks?

16:04.339 --> 16:06.133
What is this?
What the hell are we doing here?

16:06.216 --> 16:08.677
Welcome to your first
toddler pageant, Stewie.

16:08.760 --> 16:10.971
It's what you do
when you're in Texas.

16:11.054 --> 16:12.931
Oh, lovely.
A first-class ticket

16:13.015 --> 16:15.058
to a semen-stained death
in the basement.

16:15.142 --> 16:16.768
Why don't you meet
the other contestants

16:16.852 --> 16:18.645
while I go
register you?

16:18.729 --> 16:21.732
Hello. I'm, uh...
Stephanie Griffin.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.192
Hi, Stephanie.

16:23.275 --> 16:24.526
What's your talent?

16:24.610 --> 16:26.153
I sing, I do gymnastics,

16:26.236 --> 16:29.406
and I can play seven instruments
at the same time.

16:29.489 --> 16:30.782
Hmm. You could be
a threat to me.

16:30.866 --> 16:32.367
Chuck.

16:36.496 --> 16:39.041
There it is--
the Crawford Ranch.

16:39.124 --> 16:41.376
I can't believe
we're actually doing this.

16:41.460 --> 16:43.378
What a bonding adventure
for the two of us.

16:43.462 --> 16:44.755
Settle down, Meg.

16:44.838 --> 16:47.174
Okay, I see Old Man Cheney
guarding the place.

16:47.257 --> 16:49.343
(snoring)

16:49.426 --> 16:52.679
(muttering):
18% approval ratings.

16:52.763 --> 16:58.477
I'll give you 18%
of my foot in your ass.

16:58.560 --> 17:01.939
I'd like you to meet my
daughter's husband Michael.

17:15.661 --> 17:18.497
Wow! Look how
organized he is.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.082
He's already
got his sugar

17:20.165 --> 17:23.252
cut up into neat little lines
for his breakfast tomorrow.

17:23.335 --> 17:25.170
And a razor blade to shave.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.714
Wow! Look at this.

17:27.798 --> 17:29.383
I can't believe
Mrs. Bush kept

17:29.466 --> 17:31.176
all these Planned
Parenthood receipts.

17:31.260 --> 17:33.262
Holy cow! She's been
scraped more times

17:33.345 --> 17:35.013
than a fisherman's
knuckle.

17:35.097 --> 17:36.682
Hey, what are you
kids doing here?

17:36.765 --> 17:38.475
You tell Javier to back off.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.977
I'll have his money
by next week.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.645
What?
Never mind.

17:41.728 --> 17:43.272
Hey, you guys want
to see something?

17:43.355 --> 17:45.232
Grab a beer
and follow me.

17:46.233 --> 17:47.693
See this car?

17:47.776 --> 17:49.319
I restored it
myself this summer.

17:49.403 --> 17:51.905
I was here for 12 weeks.
I had to do something.

17:51.989 --> 17:55.117
But, along the way,
I learned about honesty, integrity,

17:55.200 --> 17:58.495
and cold filtered
Miller Genuine Draft.

17:58.579 --> 17:59.913
(burping)

17:59.997 --> 18:02.082
That's an adult
beverage right there.

18:02.165 --> 18:03.625
You understand
what I'm trying to say to you?

18:03.709 --> 18:06.128
Yes. But I have
just one question.

18:06.211 --> 18:07.921
Can I borrow your underpants
for ten minutes?

18:08.005 --> 18:12.009
(drumroll)

18:12.092 --> 18:14.386
ALL:
Ah!

18:17.472 --> 18:18.807
(phone rings)

18:18.891 --> 18:19.933
Hello.

18:20.017 --> 18:21.101
Oh. Hi, Jillian.

18:21.185 --> 18:23.687
Brian, I'm
reading TV Guide.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.649
Can you explain
how these cheers and jeers work again?

18:27.733 --> 18:30.319
Well, the cheers is
when they generally approve

18:30.402 --> 18:31.987
of something on television,

18:32.070 --> 18:35.157
and jeers is when
they find some sort of fault with it.

18:35.240 --> 18:38.702
Oh. See... yeah,
I'm not quite...

18:38.785 --> 18:40.662
We can't do this
over the phone.

18:40.746 --> 18:42.122
You're going to
have to come over.

18:42.206 --> 18:43.498
I can't come over.
We're still on the run

18:43.582 --> 18:45.709
because the town
thinks Stewie's possessed.

18:45.792 --> 18:47.794
No, they don't.
Didn't you hear?

18:47.878 --> 18:49.630
They stopped
chasing you weeks ago.

18:49.713 --> 18:51.423
What? I have to go.

18:51.507 --> 18:53.133
Wait, wait! I have
another question.

18:53.217 --> 18:54.718
How do I know
if I'm Jewish?

18:54.801 --> 18:56.345
Are you Jewish?
No.

18:56.428 --> 18:58.013
There you go, sport.
Thank you.

18:59.598 --> 19:01.892
Hey, guys, thanks so much
for inviting me out today.

19:01.975 --> 19:03.602
I'm psyched
to brand my first cow.

19:03.685 --> 19:05.062
Here you are, Peter.

19:05.145 --> 19:06.688
All fired up
and ready to go.

19:08.023 --> 19:10.275
(screams):
Oh...!

19:10.359 --> 19:12.736
Oh, yes!

19:12.819 --> 19:15.280
Yes! Oh!

19:15.364 --> 19:17.157
Oh, hang on a second.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.661
(muffled screaming)

19:24.665 --> 19:26.375
Man, Texas is great.

19:26.458 --> 19:27.668
Back where I'm from,

19:27.751 --> 19:30.504
a retarded guy could
never have this much fun.

19:30.587 --> 19:31.880
What did you just say?

19:31.964 --> 19:33.173
What?

19:33.257 --> 19:34.925
Technically, I'm retarded.

19:35.008 --> 19:37.386
Fellas! Fellas!
Can't we talk this over?

19:37.469 --> 19:39.221
Talking is for terrorists
and blacks.

19:39.304 --> 19:42.266
In Texas,
we execute the retarded.

19:42.349 --> 19:44.476
Oh, my God!
So this is how it ends?

19:44.560 --> 19:45.894
I always thought I'd die

19:45.978 --> 19:48.480
having to sit through
the Canadian Film Festival.

19:48.564 --> 19:51.984
I don't wish to cause you
any harm, and I won't.

19:52.067 --> 19:53.151
The end.

19:58.824 --> 20:00.492
(neighing)

20:03.871 --> 20:05.956
Horsey, you saved my life.

20:06.039 --> 20:08.709
(in Gilbert Gottfried's voice):
No problem, Peter. Glad to help out.

20:08.792 --> 20:10.544
Wow! Gilbert Gottfried.

20:10.627 --> 20:11.628
That's right!

20:11.712 --> 20:12.713
Awesome.

20:17.050 --> 20:18.760
Now the final contestant

20:18.844 --> 20:21.430
for our talent portion
of the competition,

20:21.513 --> 20:22.973
Stephanie Griffin.

20:23.056 --> 20:24.933
Thank you, thank you.

20:25.017 --> 20:27.102
Hey, what's the deal
with Chunky bars, huh?

20:27.186 --> 20:29.271
Chocolate with raisins in it?

20:29.354 --> 20:32.107
Yeah, that's what kids want
with their chocolate-- fruit.

20:32.191 --> 20:34.151
(laughter)

20:34.234 --> 20:35.485
Wow, that bit is killing.

20:35.569 --> 20:36.612
Hey, Lois, great news.

20:36.695 --> 20:37.905
We can go back to Quahog.

20:37.988 --> 20:39.656
I know, Brian. Shh!

20:39.740 --> 20:41.366
We're about to see
if Stewie won.

20:41.450 --> 20:42.784
Wait a minute. You know?

20:42.868 --> 20:44.328
How long have you known?

20:44.411 --> 20:46.413
A few weeks. Who cares?

20:46.496 --> 20:48.207
Wait a minute.
You... you've known for weeks,

20:48.290 --> 20:49.958
and you've been lying
about having to stay here?

20:50.042 --> 20:51.710
Brian, don't you see?

20:51.793 --> 20:54.630
This is a wholesome
community with real values.

20:54.713 --> 20:57.299
And our first
runner-up is...

20:58.675 --> 21:00.844
Miss Dixie-Ann Thomas.

21:00.928 --> 21:03.013
Which means that
Miss Stephanie Griffin

21:03.096 --> 21:06.141
is our new
Little Miss Texas!

21:06.225 --> 21:08.560
(applause and cheering)

21:09.853 --> 21:11.480
Oh! Oh, my God!

21:11.563 --> 21:13.106
Oh, I never expected this.

21:13.190 --> 21:15.943
Oh, I'm so, so honored.

21:16.026 --> 21:17.444
(cheering stops)

21:17.528 --> 21:19.196
Hey, that's not a girl!

21:19.279 --> 21:20.739
It's Enrico Palazzo!

21:20.822 --> 21:23.325
No, it's not!
It's one of them queerosexuals!

21:23.408 --> 21:24.618
Get him!

21:24.701 --> 21:27.704
(yelling angrily)

21:30.249 --> 21:31.583
Quick! Get on!

21:39.925 --> 21:41.552
Thank you for
all your help.

21:41.635 --> 21:43.804
My pleasure,
Peter. Anytime.

21:43.887 --> 21:45.472
Oh, fantastic.

21:45.556 --> 21:46.723
Hey, do you still
do stand-up?

21:46.807 --> 21:48.517
I do. I'm still touring.

21:48.600 --> 21:49.810
Oh, wow. Can we
get tickets?

21:49.893 --> 21:51.144
Absolutely.

21:51.228 --> 21:52.396
I'm in Atlanta next week.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.273
Great. Oh, well,
this will be fun.

22:02.072 --> 22:04.408
It is so good to be home.

22:04.491 --> 22:05.659
You know,
I wanted us to live

22:05.742 --> 22:08.453
in a place with
real family values.

22:08.537 --> 22:10.497
But values don't come
from where you live

22:10.581 --> 22:12.249
or who your friends are.

22:12.332 --> 22:14.918
They come from inside,
from your own beliefs.

22:15.002 --> 22:16.336
I agree, Lois.

22:16.420 --> 22:18.255
Like, for instance,
if you're watching a TV show,

22:18.338 --> 22:21.884
and you decide to take
your values from that, you're an idiot.

22:21.967 --> 22:23.760
Maybe you should
take responsibility

22:23.844 --> 22:25.721
for what values
your kids are getting.

22:25.804 --> 22:27.306
Maybe you shouldn't
be letting your kids

22:27.389 --> 22:28.974
watch certain shows
in the first place

22:29.057 --> 22:30.767
if you have such
a big problem with them,

22:30.851 --> 22:32.936
instead of blaming the
shows themselves.

22:34.980 --> 22:35.981
Yeah.
