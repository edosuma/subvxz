WEBVTT

00:01.735 --> 00:02.470
- Mike Painter,
back on the show.

00:04.072 --> 00:05.506
You lost a twin brother
when you were 12?

00:05.539 --> 00:06.507
- In 1988,
five kids went missing.

00:06.540 --> 00:08.142
- The Iron Hill murders.

00:08.176 --> 00:09.177
- The one they never
found was Eddie.

00:09.210 --> 00:11.179
You guys remember
"Candle Cove?"

00:11.212 --> 00:12.180
- That show used to give me
the worst nightmares.

00:12.213 --> 00:13.181
- Katie just saw it.

00:13.214 --> 00:15.183
- Katie!
- Katie!

00:15.216 --> 00:16.384
- The only time the show ever
aired was during the murders.

00:16.417 --> 00:18.186
Now it shows back up again.

00:18.219 --> 00:20.254
- You were released from
a psych ward three days ago.

00:20.288 --> 00:21.389
- It did something
to my brother.

00:21.422 --> 00:23.257
It can make people do things.

00:23.291 --> 00:24.825
- Who made it up?
You used to sit,

00:24.858 --> 00:26.560
just watching the static.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.762
- I brought your daughter back.
Minus a couple teeth.

00:28.796 --> 00:30.898
- Mike, we're just
getting started again.

00:30.931 --> 00:33.934

[ominous music]

00:49.783 --> 00:56.790
*

01:11.939 --> 01:14.242
- The bodies of four missing
Iron Hill children

01:14.275 --> 01:16.144
were found this afternoon.

01:16.144 --> 01:18.612
Police are still searching
for a fifth child,

01:18.646 --> 01:20.548
12-year-old Eddie Painter.

01:20.581 --> 01:22.550
[static crackles]

01:22.583 --> 01:26.154
- Laughingstock, that's one
whale of a storm.

01:26.154 --> 01:28.055
We better run and hide.

01:28.156 --> 01:32.160
[thunder crashes]

01:32.193 --> 01:33.761
- Oh, look.

01:33.794 --> 01:35.429
It's Bravery Cave.

01:35.463 --> 01:36.497
[laughs]

01:36.530 --> 01:40.734
You have to go inside.

01:40.768 --> 01:43.070
[laughs]

01:43.171 --> 01:46.974
- Your new friend
is waiting for you.

01:47.007 --> 01:51.179
Now it's time to come
and play a game with him.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.280
- But, uh...

01:52.313 --> 01:54.182
I don't know how to play.

01:54.182 --> 01:56.317
- You've met him before.

01:56.350 --> 01:58.186
But you don't remember.

01:59.553 --> 02:01.655
Katie.

02:01.689 --> 02:03.357
Katie.

02:04.658 --> 02:07.027
Look under your bed, Katie.

02:07.060 --> 02:08.262
We miss you.

02:08.296 --> 02:11.332
Come back and visit us
in the cave.

02:17.905 --> 02:21.609
- [screams] Mom!
- Dane?

02:21.642 --> 02:23.977
- Mom! Mom!
- Dane?

02:24.011 --> 02:25.479
Dane?

02:25.513 --> 02:27.114
Dane?

02:27.215 --> 02:31.319
- Oh, my God!
Katie, what did you do?

02:31.352 --> 02:34.121
- What did you do?
- Get away from him.

02:34.222 --> 02:36.990
Get her away from him!

02:37.024 --> 02:39.460
- Mike?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.995
Dane's in surgery.

02:42.029 --> 02:45.299
She stabbed him
in his sleep.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.235
She had a hook.

02:47.235 --> 02:51.305
Katie, she--
where did she get a hook?

02:51.339 --> 02:54.642
She's here,
but something's wrong.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.077
She won't talk.

02:57.110 --> 03:00.281
Look, I
know you said that...

03:00.314 --> 03:04.252
this show,

03:04.252 --> 03:07.721
it can make people do things.

03:07.755 --> 03:10.891
Will you please come back?

03:10.924 --> 03:15.363
If you're connected
to it at all, please.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.368
Please.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.371
[ominous music]

03:23.404 --> 03:30.411
*

03:41.154 --> 03:45.926
- That child wouldn't
hurt anybody.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.962
- Unless someone
or something made her.

03:52.433 --> 03:55.436
- It's starting again,
isn't it?

03:58.572 --> 04:01.642
- I'm gonna try to stop it.

04:06.146 --> 04:09.149
- I'm gonna help you.

04:17.458 --> 04:20.428
[soft music]

04:20.461 --> 04:27.468
*

04:44.985 --> 04:46.987
- Hey.
- Shh.

04:56.497 --> 04:59.500
- Hey.
- I know you.

05:04.505 --> 05:05.773
- How's Dane?

05:05.806 --> 05:08.108
- He won't stop picking
at his stitches.

05:08.141 --> 05:12.380
- Yeah. She's under observation
until the DA figures out

05:12.413 --> 05:16.283
if he wants to charge her.

05:16.384 --> 05:22.690
- Gary, I asked Mike
to come talk to her.

05:22.723 --> 05:24.392
- You don't think you should
have talked to me

05:24.425 --> 05:25.493
before asking him back?

05:25.526 --> 05:27.395
I don't think that was
a good decision.

05:27.395 --> 05:29.397
- This is what he does.

05:31.865 --> 05:33.501
- Do you really think that he
just happened

05:33.534 --> 05:34.835
to find her out there?

05:34.868 --> 05:36.504
- I think that something
is going on with her,

05:36.537 --> 05:38.639
something that nobody
here seems to be able

05:38.672 --> 05:41.409
to wrap their head around.

05:41.409 --> 05:44.412
So let's use
the resource we have.

05:49.850 --> 05:53.253
When I stopped at the house,
I got her bird.

05:57.057 --> 06:01.495
What?

06:01.529 --> 06:03.531
- Sit down.

06:03.564 --> 06:06.567
[indistinct chatter]

06:11.439 --> 06:14.542
How are you holding up,
having him home?

06:17.478 --> 06:21.449
- It's so strange.

06:21.449 --> 06:25.953
I barely know him.

06:25.986 --> 06:29.590
I just--
do you remember, back then,

06:29.623 --> 06:35.463
a kids' show on TV
called "Candle Cove?"

06:35.496 --> 06:39.467
- Something the boys
used to watch?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.034
I don't know.

06:41.068 --> 06:45.773
Jacob watched
all kinds of things.

06:45.806 --> 06:48.676
It's been such a long time.

07:01.689 --> 07:04.692
- Look who's back
in the middle of things.

07:08.295 --> 07:11.599
- I just want to help.
- What's got into her?

07:11.632 --> 07:15.002
What makes a nice kid like that
try and disembowel her brother?

07:20.541 --> 07:23.544
- Too much TV.

07:25.312 --> 07:27.314
- See you around.

07:43.697 --> 07:45.699
- I'm so sorry.

07:47.735 --> 07:48.702
- Thank you for coming.

07:48.736 --> 07:51.539
- Yeah, of course.

07:51.539 --> 07:54.542
How are you holding up?

07:57.545 --> 08:01.248
- I'm not going to win Mother
of the Year anytime soon.

08:01.281 --> 08:04.885
- [chuckles]

08:04.918 --> 08:08.889
- But you'll talk to me,
after?

08:08.922 --> 08:11.925
- Yeah, of course.
Absolutely.

08:14.061 --> 08:17.064
Is that for her?

08:19.833 --> 08:25.072
- Patients in police custody
can't receive gifts.

08:27.274 --> 08:30.277
- Your husband's the sheriff.

08:38.285 --> 08:42.055
[ominous music]

08:42.089 --> 08:44.091
Excuse me.

08:46.359 --> 08:49.229
Do you know what kid
drew this?

08:49.262 --> 08:52.265
- No. Why?

08:55.102 --> 08:58.071
- Never mind.
Thanks.

08:58.105 --> 09:05.212
*

09:13.821 --> 09:16.123
- She saw "Candle Cove?"

09:16.156 --> 09:18.626
"Candle Cove,"
you're sure?

09:18.626 --> 09:23.263
- So it wasn't broadcast
from here?

09:23.296 --> 09:25.633
- I wish.

09:25.633 --> 09:27.635
I can't believe
somebody saw it again.

09:27.668 --> 09:30.437
Was this an old episode
or something new?

09:30.470 --> 09:33.273
- Well, I have no idea.
Who made it?

09:33.306 --> 09:35.208
I couldn't find
anything online.

09:35.242 --> 09:38.445
- Well, that's "Candle Cove."

09:38.478 --> 09:41.715
- [exhales deeply]
How do I go to see it?

09:41.749 --> 09:43.984
- [chuckles]

09:44.017 --> 09:45.653
- What?

09:45.653 --> 09:48.656
- Okay. Okay, sure.

09:52.325 --> 09:55.328
You want to see
something cool?

09:58.298 --> 10:01.268
This is my favorite episode.

10:01.301 --> 10:03.671
Laughingstock comes
to Iron Hill.

10:03.704 --> 10:07.841
- Oh, my God.
Let's go.

10:07.875 --> 10:12.445
- What's it about?
- Action, adventure,

10:12.479 --> 10:15.649
friends, enemies,
all the good stuff.

10:15.683 --> 10:18.118
What's a kids' show
supposed to do?

10:18.151 --> 10:19.820
Make you feel good, right?

10:19.853 --> 10:21.755
Special hook.

10:21.789 --> 10:24.557
Make you want to live
in that world.

10:27.460 --> 10:30.430
That's what "Candle Cove"
is all about.

10:30.463 --> 10:33.433

*

10:48.481 --> 10:50.483
[rustling]

10:55.756 --> 10:59.727
- You made this.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.394
- Had you, didn't I?

11:01.428 --> 11:04.397
It's fan-fic.
It's a love letter.

11:04.431 --> 11:06.566
- You don't have
the real show?

11:06.599 --> 11:08.736
- Nobody does.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.970
It was unrecordable.

11:10.003 --> 11:12.806
Something in the signal.

11:12.840 --> 11:14.407
- Just get this clear.

11:14.441 --> 11:16.009
This isn't something
you heard about?

11:16.043 --> 11:18.746
You actually saw it in 1988?

11:18.779 --> 11:20.748
- We all did.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.583
Funny thing, it never aired
on the same channel.

11:23.616 --> 11:27.087
Come over one of the dead
channels at the end of the dial.

11:29.757 --> 11:33.761
You had to find it.

11:33.794 --> 11:36.663
- Does that mean
somebody must have--

11:36.764 --> 11:40.200
was it hacked
into other channels?

11:40.233 --> 11:46.874
- Pirate signal
for a pirate show.

11:46.907 --> 11:49.910
Pretty clever, right?

12:40.994 --> 12:43.831
- Katie, does that
bird have a name?

12:49.837 --> 12:51.638
I have something else.

13:00.914 --> 13:05.285
Katie,
do you know what this is?

13:05.318 --> 13:07.320
Did you draw this?

13:12.692 --> 13:15.863
It looks like a pirate ship,

13:15.896 --> 13:17.865
a tree,

13:17.865 --> 13:21.001
a cloud,

13:21.034 --> 13:24.504
and over here,

13:24.537 --> 13:28.275
looks to me like a cave.

13:28.308 --> 13:31.378
Do you think I'm right?

13:39.252 --> 13:42.890
Katie,

13:42.890 --> 13:45.325
I'm gonna ask you
a very important question.

13:45.358 --> 13:48.361
You're not gonna
get in trouble.

13:51.064 --> 13:55.335
What happened when you saw
"Candle Cove?"

13:57.070 --> 14:01.308
- How long is jail?

14:01.341 --> 14:04.677
- You're not going
to jail, Katie.

14:04.711 --> 14:08.348
You're in a hospital
because we want to help you.

14:08.381 --> 14:12.019
And nobody blames you.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.653
What you did

14:13.686 --> 14:16.924
was not your fault.

14:16.924 --> 14:20.227
I know it wasn't your fault.

14:28.068 --> 14:32.772
Where were you all that time?

14:32.805 --> 14:37.044
- Don't you remember?

14:37.077 --> 14:40.047
You've been there too.

14:50.557 --> 14:54.427
- Where?
Where?

14:54.461 --> 14:58.098
- The cave where we went.

15:02.135 --> 15:03.971
- Who's we?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.405
You and me?

15:05.438 --> 15:08.976
Or you and someone else?

15:08.976 --> 15:10.978
Was anyone else there?

15:13.846 --> 15:17.117
- The boy.

15:17.150 --> 15:19.987
- What boy?

15:20.020 --> 15:22.289
- He was underground
for a long time,

15:22.322 --> 15:25.825
but somebody took him
to a cave.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.861
- And who put him there?

15:32.465 --> 15:34.467
Katie?

15:42.775 --> 15:45.612
- You have to go inside.

15:45.645 --> 15:50.350

15:50.383 --> 15:52.385
- Mike.

[ominous music]

16:42.435 --> 16:42.702
.

16:42.735 --> 16:43.836
- I think it's probably better
if you don't talk to her again

16:45.605 --> 16:50.977
unless Jess or I
are there, okay?

16:51.078 --> 16:52.712
- Gary, have there been
any other

16:52.745 --> 16:55.648
missing persons cases
around here recently?

16:55.682 --> 16:59.852
Other counties, maybe?

16:59.886 --> 17:02.955
- No.
Why?

17:07.360 --> 17:10.363
Mike?
You okay?

17:14.734 --> 17:16.736
- Katie's gonna be fine.

17:49.736 --> 17:51.738
[doorbell rings]

17:54.774 --> 17:57.144
- Oh, hi there.
I'm Officer Amy.

17:57.144 --> 17:58.278
[both chuckle]

17:58.311 --> 18:01.414
You're such a dork.
Come in.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.416
- So, somebody broke in?
- Yeah.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.218
I didn't notice
'till this morning.

18:05.252 --> 18:07.720
The old keepsake box my mom
gave me for graduation?

18:07.754 --> 18:08.888
It's gone.

18:08.921 --> 18:10.790
Why steal just that?

18:10.823 --> 18:13.460
- What else do you keep in it?
- Cheap stuff.

18:13.493 --> 18:16.429
And Alex's baby teeth.

18:16.463 --> 18:18.498
- You keep his teeth?

18:18.531 --> 18:20.500
- Don't look at me like
I'm strange.

18:20.533 --> 18:22.802
It's part of him.

18:22.835 --> 18:24.604
- Yeah. His bones.

18:24.637 --> 18:26.439
You ever think about that?

18:26.473 --> 18:30.610
Every time you smile, you're,
like, showing off your skeleton.

18:30.643 --> 18:33.646
- Just wait.
You'll understand.

18:35.982 --> 18:38.985
[phone vibrating]

18:56.703 --> 18:58.838
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, Daddy.

18:58.871 --> 19:01.040
- How was your horseback
riding lesson?

19:01.208 --> 19:05.378
- Good. I rode Gypsy.
I gave her an apple.

19:05.412 --> 19:07.447
- Yeah?
Did she have bad breath?

19:07.480 --> 19:09.216

don't brush their teeth.

don't they?

She's gonna babysit me
this weekend.

that place?

a railroad track.

Isn't that the cement plant
out by the old rail yard

used to play even though

Where are you going?

21:07.334 --> 21:11.003
You think she went there?

21:11.037 --> 21:14.907

made "Candle Cove"

21:14.941 --> 21:17.944
took her somewhere else
before the Crow's Nest.

21:17.977 --> 21:20.347

she saw a boy,

21:20.347 --> 21:24.016

Maybe she imagined this boy,
or made him up.

21:56.282 --> 22:01.854

out there...

doesn't close the wound up?

each other.

that someday,

on the door.

with some mothers who,

to bond with their children.
