00:12.821 --> 00:14.754
Don't do that, you tickle me.

00:14.790 --> 00:17.023
You made the spray paint
come out of my nose.

00:17.059 --> 00:18.892
What, do I have
paint on my face?

00:18.927 --> 00:21.394
Dude, look at the moon!

00:21.430 --> 00:23.964
Oh, whoa...

00:27.336 --> 00:28.601
What?

00:28.637 --> 00:30.270
When you see a moon like that,

00:30.305 --> 00:31.438
do you ever think...

00:31.473 --> 00:34.240
life is so amazing

00:34.276 --> 00:36.843

shouldn't waste it

high all the time?

00:39.114 --> 00:40.847
No.

00:40.882 --> 00:43.950
I think about how
I wish I were a werewolf.

00:43.986 --> 00:46.286
What would you do

02:26.806 --> 02:29.173
Scully, since we've been away,

02:29.208 --> 02:32.443
much of the "unexplained"
has been explained.

02:32.478 --> 02:33.877
The "Death Valley
Racetrack"?

02:33.913 --> 02:36.380
Turns out it was just
ice formations,

02:36.415 --> 02:38.949
moving the rocks around

02:38.985 --> 02:40.384
as it melted.

02:40.419 --> 02:41.885
Yeah, ice.

02:41.921 --> 02:43.954
Humility prevents me
from recounting

02:43.990 --> 02:45.055
how I once thought

02:45.091 --> 02:46.056
it had something to do with

02:46.092 --> 02:47.157
a series of mysterious sightings

02:47.193 --> 02:49.226
of a rock-like creature
in Colorado...

02:49.262 --> 02:51.362
which turned out to just be

02:51.397 --> 02:52.630
a publicity stunt

02:52.665 --> 02:54.064
by a local landscaping business.

02:54.100 --> 02:55.266
It's amazing,

02:55.301 --> 02:58.202
going through
these archives with fresh--

02:58.237 --> 02:59.603
if not wiser-- eyes,

02:59.639 --> 03:02.306
how many of these cases,

03:02.341 --> 03:03.741
whether it's
"The Amarillo Armadillo Man"

03:03.776 --> 03:06.243
or "The Hairy Whatzit
of Walla Walla..."

03:07.513 --> 03:09.780
...can be explained away
as fraternity pranks,

03:09.815 --> 03:12.616
practical jokes
or people making stuff up

03:12.652 --> 03:14.952
simply because
they're bored and/or crazy.

03:14.987 --> 03:16.253
And if that doesn't explain it,

03:16.289 --> 03:17.688
well, then it was
probably just ice.

03:17.723 --> 03:20.858
Mulder, have you been
taking your meds?

03:20.893 --> 03:23.961
Scully, Charles Fort
spent his entire life

03:23.996 --> 03:26.897
researching natural
and scientific anomalies,

03:26.932 --> 03:28.899
which he published
in four books,

03:28.934 --> 03:30.868
all of which I know by heart.

03:30.903 --> 03:32.136
And at the end
of his life,

03:32.171 --> 03:33.671
Fort himself wondered

03:33.706 --> 03:35.039
if it hadn't all been a waste.

03:35.074 --> 03:36.373
I get it.

03:36.409 --> 03:38.976
I'm a middle-aged man, Scully--

03:39.011 --> 03:41.111
no, I am, I am.

03:41.147 --> 03:42.980
I'm thinking maybe

03:43.015 --> 03:45.449
it's time to put away
childish things--

03:45.484 --> 03:49.520
the Sasquatches and mothmen
and... jackalopes.

03:51.691 --> 03:54.825
I thought it'd be great
to get back to work.

03:54.860 --> 03:57.561
But is this really how I want
to spend the rest of my days?

03:57.596 --> 03:59.963
Chasing after monsters?

03:59.999 --> 04:02.132
We've been given
another case, Mulder.

04:02.168 --> 04:04.501
It has a monster in it.

04:07.440 --> 04:10.641
One witness claimed that
the creature had three eyes

04:10.676 --> 04:12.142
and the other one, one.

04:12.178 --> 04:15.212
Notice they didn't get
a picture of it, which is odd,

04:15.247 --> 04:17.815
because everybody always has
a camera on them these days.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.718
You want to talk to these
witnesses while we're here?

04:21.754 --> 04:22.753
Oh...

04:23.989 --> 04:26.390
Anyway, this
is the area

04:26.425 --> 04:28.325
where they say
they saw the creature

04:28.361 --> 04:30.728
attacking the animal
control officer,

04:30.763 --> 04:32.396
even though he claims
to not have seen

04:32.431 --> 04:34.098
whatever it was
that was attacking him.

04:34.133 --> 04:35.299
Of course not.

04:35.334 --> 04:36.934
Mountain lions always attack
from behind.

04:36.969 --> 04:38.936
He was out here responding
to a call about a mountain lion.

04:38.971 --> 04:40.170
It was a mountain lion!

04:40.206 --> 04:41.438
That's what killed
the other victim, too.

04:41.474 --> 04:45.442
Well, that is what the
local authorities thought,

04:45.478 --> 04:46.677
until they did a search
the next morning

04:46.712 --> 04:48.011
and they found
this area over here,

04:48.047 --> 04:50.848
where they found
three more victims.

04:52.685 --> 04:53.851
Grey wolves, Scully.

04:53.886 --> 04:56.320
They've made a comeback
in this region.

04:56.355 --> 04:59.556
Wolves take their prey
back to a lair.

04:59.592 --> 05:01.425
Well, they were all mutilated

05:01.460 --> 05:03.093
in exactly the same manner.

05:03.129 --> 05:06.363
However, the third victim
wasn't wearing any clothes.

05:06.399 --> 05:07.631
Maybe he was a nudist.

05:07.666 --> 05:09.967
Took a midnight hike
in the nude,

05:10.002 --> 05:12.302
got attacked by a wolf
or a lion or a bear.

05:12.338 --> 05:14.905
Maybe all at the same time.

05:14.940 --> 05:16.373
That's how I'd like to go out.

05:16.409 --> 05:19.276
The uniqueness
of the wounds, Mulder,

05:19.311 --> 05:21.311
implies a human element.

05:21.347 --> 05:23.647
Aw, Scully, I gave up profiling

05:23.682 --> 05:25.182
before I gave up monsters.

05:25.217 --> 05:27.651
You've seen one serial killer,
you've seen 'em all.

05:27.686 --> 05:29.653
Mulder, I can see that
you're going through

05:29.688 --> 05:31.155
a questioning phase
of some sort,

05:31.190 --> 05:33.590
but people have
been killed here.

05:33.626 --> 05:34.792
And if we can help stop that

05:34.827 --> 05:37.528
and save some lives,
I think that is a...

05:37.563 --> 05:40.063

for us to do,

05:40.099 --> 05:43.066

the thing we find

05:44.837 --> 05:46.603
- otherwise.
- Okay.

05:46.639 --> 05:48.005

05:48.040 --> 05:49.273

05:49.308 --> 05:51.775
when we catch whatever
is doing these killings...

to have two eyes.

Ah. Hey.
You're overlooking the video.

10:19.485 --> 10:20.450
Look.

10:20.486 --> 10:23.086
(screaming)

10:23.122 --> 10:25.522
Mulder, you've got the lens
pointed the wrong way.

10:25.557 --> 10:26.823
Yeah, it's the new camera app.

10:26.859 --> 10:27.858
But look.

10:29.795 --> 10:31.461
It shot blood at me.

10:31.497 --> 10:34.231
From out its eyeball,
Scully-- I think.

10:34.266 --> 10:35.732
It was hard for me to see,

10:35.767 --> 10:37.100
because I had blood in my eyes.

10:37.136 --> 10:38.969
I haven't done
the blood analysis yet,

10:39.004 --> 10:41.004
but it's probably residue

10:41.039 --> 10:42.739
from the prior attack
on this victim.

10:42.774 --> 10:45.842
And animals don't shoot blood
out of their eyeballs.

10:45.878 --> 10:47.144
Oh, no?

10:47.179 --> 10:48.678
Well, tell that
to the horned lizard.

10:48.714 --> 10:52.449
Which shoots blood
out its eyeball, Scully, yes.

10:52.484 --> 10:53.850
It's a defense mechanism.

10:53.886 --> 10:55.252
Scientific fact!

10:55.287 --> 10:57.587
Mulder, the Internet
is not good for you.

10:57.623 --> 10:58.855
Doesn't this bear a resemblance

10:58.891 --> 11:00.223
to what witnesses
claim they saw?

11:00.259 --> 11:01.958
What, so now you're saying
that you were attacked

11:01.994 --> 11:03.426
by a six-foot horny toad?

11:03.462 --> 11:05.162
Whoa. Let's just keep this

11:05.197 --> 11:07.264
within the realm of
the natural sciences, shall we?

11:07.299 --> 11:09.933
My initial exam
of the bite marks

11:09.968 --> 11:11.501
on this wound
would suggest

11:11.537 --> 11:13.003
that they were made
by a human being.

11:13.038 --> 11:16.540
So we're looking for
a man-sized horned lizard

11:16.575 --> 11:18.241
with human teeth.

11:20.546 --> 11:23.013
Sounds a bit silly, doesn't it?

11:23.048 --> 11:24.681
Yeah.

11:24.716 --> 11:27.517
You're really enjoying yourself,
aren't you, Scully?

11:27.553 --> 11:29.186
Yeah.

11:29.221 --> 11:30.720
I am.

11:30.756 --> 11:32.022
I forgot how much fun

11:32.057 --> 11:34.024
these cases
could be.

11:34.059 --> 11:37.394
It's been a long day, Mulder.

11:37.429 --> 11:40.597
Why don't you go back
to the hotel and get some sleep?

11:40.632 --> 11:42.566
And try not to dream
about monsters.

11:44.670 --> 11:46.469
(insects trilling, wolf howls)

11:48.307 --> 11:50.273
MAN:
Aah! Monster!

11:50.309 --> 11:52.175
Help me! It's a monster!

11:52.211 --> 11:54.044
(man sobbing)

12:00.252 --> 12:01.218
Everything okay in here?

12:01.253 --> 12:02.219
Uh, yeah.

12:02.254 --> 12:04.654
I apologize for the disturbance.

12:04.690 --> 12:06.656
Just an argument
with an unruly guest.

12:06.692 --> 12:07.924
Now, please,
go back to your room.

12:07.960 --> 12:09.659
I heard someone
yell "Monster!"

12:09.695 --> 12:11.628
That's what he had
the nerve to call me,

12:11.663 --> 12:13.697
just because I asked him
to pay his overdue bill.

12:13.732 --> 12:15.665
Does that make me
some kind of a monster?

12:15.701 --> 12:16.700
Of course not.

12:16.735 --> 12:17.867
Exactly.

12:17.903 --> 12:20.704
Now, please go away
or I'll kill you.

Hey. W-What the hell

I had it put in after 9/11.

14:13.485 --> 14:14.984
I'm not gonna report you.

14:15.020 --> 14:17.887
When one checks into an

14:17.923 --> 14:19.889
one expects the manager

14:19.925 --> 14:21.991
But I do harbor
suspicions

14:22.027 --> 14:23.760
that you saw something
in that trashed room

14:23.795 --> 14:25.261
that greatly
disturbed you.

14:25.297 --> 14:26.963
You mind telling me
what that was?

14:39.244 --> 14:42.479
Yeah...
(mumbling happily)

14:42.514 --> 14:45.048
MAN: Every day it's
the same thing!

14:45.083 --> 14:46.049
Why?

14:46.084 --> 14:48.318
I hate you!

14:48.353 --> 14:50.353
I can't go on
like this!

14:50.389 --> 14:51.688
I'm going insane having

14:51.723 --> 14:53.723
to look at you every day!

14:54.793 --> 14:56.493
Enough!

14:58.497 --> 14:59.829
That's going on his bill.

14:59.865 --> 15:02.932
And you!
You bastard...

15:04.369 --> 15:05.468
(alarm ringing)

15:05.504 --> 15:07.871
You are not waking me up
again tomorrow.

15:07.906 --> 15:09.038
Do you understand?!

15:09.074 --> 15:10.740
I'm sick of it!

15:10.776 --> 15:12.242
Ah...

15:12.277 --> 15:13.443
It's happening again.

15:13.478 --> 15:16.045
Please!

15:16.081 --> 15:17.914
Let this be the last time.

15:19.117 --> 15:21.518
(whimpers)

15:21.553 --> 15:22.619
Huh?

15:26.892 --> 15:28.224
Aah!

15:28.260 --> 15:29.726

15:29.761 --> 15:30.693

15:30.729 --> 15:32.362
(roars)

15:32.397 --> 15:33.463
Now you can't see...

15:33.498 --> 15:35.598
(screaming)

15:35.634 --> 15:38.067
- (roaring)
- Monster!

15:38.103 --> 15:39.736
<i>Help me! It's a...</i>

15:39.771 --> 15:40.937
Monster.

15:43.074 --> 15:46.142
Is this the creature
that you saw?

15:46.178 --> 15:48.378
But with two eyes?

15:48.413 --> 15:49.679
Yeah.

15:49.714 --> 15:50.747
That's exactly it.

15:51.650 --> 15:53.149
And is this the man?

15:54.319 --> 15:56.286
Oh.

15:56.321 --> 15:57.787
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

15:57.823 --> 16:00.457
They're one and the same.

16:00.492 --> 16:03.092
It's a monster, Scully,
plain and simple.

16:03.128 --> 16:06.262
And not just your everyday,
run-of-the-mill monster,

16:06.298 --> 16:07.430
but we're talking
transformation here.

16:07.466 --> 16:09.632
Man into monster and back again.

16:09.668 --> 16:10.967
To which I know
you're going to say--

16:11.002 --> 16:13.336
"But, Mulder, that only happens
in werewolf myths

16:13.371 --> 16:15.705
that were originally concocted
to explain away

16:15.740 --> 16:17.040
the violent behavior of people

16:17.075 --> 16:18.374
who'd been bitten
by rabid animals,

16:18.410 --> 16:20.043
before the medical
discovery of rabies."

16:20.078 --> 16:22.679
But is it so outlandish
to believe that some legends

16:22.714 --> 16:25.114
are based on actual occurrences
and not just ignorance?

16:25.150 --> 16:27.183
To which I know what
you're going to say, Scully,

16:27.219 --> 16:28.785
you're going to say,
"But, Mulder,

16:28.820 --> 16:31.821
it defies every known law
of science and nature."

16:31.857 --> 16:34.123
Exactly, Scully--
every <i> known</i> law.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.659
What if this creature
that we've stumbled upon

16:36.695 --> 16:38.528
is here to create
a whole new paradigm

16:38.563 --> 16:40.296
for our understanding
of life itself?

16:40.332 --> 16:45.101
Or maybe science was used to
create this "unnatural" being.

16:45.136 --> 16:47.003
Maybe this is some
GMO experiment run amok

16:47.038 --> 16:50.173
by some military-agro-big-pharma
corporation.

16:50.208 --> 16:52.909
Maybe this guy
is its chief geneticist,

16:52.944 --> 16:54.911
who recklessly
experimented on himself

16:54.946 --> 16:56.846
and now transforms into a fiend

16:56.882 --> 16:58.348
who needs to feast
on human flesh.

16:58.383 --> 17:00.950
To which I know
you're going to say--

17:00.986 --> 17:02.819
"But, Mulder, that sounds
like the paranoid ravings

17:02.854 --> 17:05.521
of some lunatic madman."

17:05.557 --> 17:07.891
I don't know what
this thing is, Scully,

17:07.925 --> 17:10.827
and I don't know exactly
how it came to be, I just...

17:10.862 --> 17:14.531
All I'm saying is,
it's a monster.

17:16.667 --> 17:19.469
Yeah, this is how
I like my Mulder.

17:19.503 --> 17:20.803
So you're agreeing with me?

17:20.839 --> 17:22.539
No!

17:22.574 --> 17:24.339
You're batcrap crazy!

17:24.376 --> 17:25.308
But what about the facts?

17:25.343 --> 17:26.309
What facts?

17:26.344 --> 17:28.044
This guy--

17:28.079 --> 17:31.347
who the manager just
saw turn into a monster--

17:31.383 --> 17:33.750
was wearing the clothes
of one of our victims,

17:33.785 --> 17:35.418
which we did not notice
at the time,

17:35.453 --> 17:37.487
because we thought we were
looking for an animal.

17:37.522 --> 17:38.922
Turns out we were only
half right.

17:38.957 --> 17:40.924
Yeah, okay. Well, we need
to talk to this guy.

17:40.959 --> 17:42.525
Well, I doubt he's coming
back to his room.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.694
I did retrieve some personal
items from it, though,

17:44.729 --> 17:46.195
that might help us
track him down.

17:46.231 --> 17:49.265
Well, that sounds like
a good investigative plan.

17:49.301 --> 17:52.835
The first thing
we need to do, though...

17:52.871 --> 17:54.904
check out of this motel.

17:57.344 --> 18:00.077
Once upon a time,
there was a village

18:00.112 --> 18:04.648
that was being tormented
by a man-eating lizard-dragon.

18:04.683 --> 18:07.017
The local constable
did everything

18:07.052 --> 18:08.351
to try to kill this creature,

18:08.387 --> 18:10.454
but nothing
could stop it.

18:10.489 --> 18:13.256
So, finally,
he visits a gypsy,

18:13.292 --> 18:16.626
who tells him the only way
to kill this monster

18:16.662 --> 18:18.695
is to stab it in its appendix

18:18.730 --> 18:21.531
with a lance
made of green glass.

18:21.567 --> 18:23.767
Wh... why the green glass?

18:23.802 --> 18:25.268
And why the appendix?

18:25.304 --> 18:27.170
Who the hell knows?

18:27.206 --> 18:29.072
In these old fairy tales,

18:29.108 --> 18:30.974
the monster must
always be destroyed

18:31.009 --> 18:33.143
by some form of penetration--

18:33.178 --> 18:35.779
a silver bullet,
a wooden stake--

18:35.814 --> 18:39.082
obviously, our ancestors
were as obsessed

18:39.118 --> 18:41.418
with impotency
as we are, eh?

18:41.453 --> 18:43.987
So, he fashions
a lance of green glass

18:44.022 --> 18:46.490
and stabs the monster
in its appendix.

18:46.525 --> 18:49.326
But as the monster is dying,

18:49.361 --> 18:50.660
the constable realizes

18:50.696 --> 18:53.797
he's been looking
in the mirror.

18:53.832 --> 18:56.766
He was the monster all along,
you see?

18:56.802 --> 18:58.935
The moral being...?

18:58.971 --> 19:01.238
It's easier
to believe in monsters

19:01.273 --> 19:03.874
out there in the world

19:03.909 --> 19:07.477
than to accept that the real
monsters dwell within us

19:07.513 --> 19:08.478
here...

19:08.514 --> 19:11.314
and sometimes here.

19:11.350 --> 19:12.849
Maybe sometimes here.
(chuckles)

19:12.885 --> 19:16.453
Not everything can be reduced
to psychology.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.687
That's what you think.

19:17.723 --> 19:19.089
At any rate,

19:19.124 --> 19:20.590
I was reminded of this tale

19:20.626 --> 19:22.692
because of
your suspect's delusion

19:22.728 --> 19:24.094
that when the moon appears,

19:24.129 --> 19:25.662
he would turn into a werewolf.

19:25.697 --> 19:26.796
Werewolf?

19:26.832 --> 19:29.666
I'm sorry.
I meant "were-lizard."

19:29.701 --> 19:32.769
The werewolf was
my patient on Monday.

19:32.804 --> 19:34.437
At any event,

19:34.473 --> 19:37.174
I prescribed for him
this antipsychotic,

19:37.209 --> 19:39.476
but I doubt
it did him much good.

19:39.511 --> 19:40.644
Why not?

19:40.679 --> 19:43.513
He seemed pretty crazy.

19:45.050 --> 19:49.286
Your, uh, records don't provide
much information,

19:49.321 --> 19:52.889
and I'm assuming that Guy Mann
is not a real name.

19:52.925 --> 19:55.125
Do you have any idea
of how I might find him?

19:55.160 --> 19:59.095
I recommended, the next time
he felt an episode coming on,

19:59.131 --> 20:02.499
that he go for a quiet stroll
in the local cemetery.

20:02.534 --> 20:06.503
A reminder that no matter
how overwhelming

20:06.538 --> 20:08.205
our anxieties
might be,

20:08.240 --> 20:10.307
they will soon be resolved,

20:10.342 --> 20:13.376
when we are dead and buried
for all eternity.

20:13.412 --> 20:16.546
Do you really think that's
sound therapeutic advice?

20:16.582 --> 20:19.082
It's what <i> I</i> do.

20:20.285 --> 20:21.251
Thank you, Doctor.

20:21.286 --> 20:23.787
Uh... a moment.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.021
A prescription...

20:25.057 --> 20:26.122
for yourself.

20:26.158 --> 20:27.224
For me?

20:27.259 --> 20:28.592
Why me?

20:28.627 --> 20:30.760
Perhaps I've read you wrong,
Mr. Mulder,

20:30.796 --> 20:32.696
but I wonder--

20:32.731 --> 20:35.498
who is in more need
of an antipsychotic,

20:35.534 --> 20:39.402
a man who believes
himself to be a were-lizard

20:39.438 --> 20:42.272
or a man who believes that man?
Hmm?

20:43.442 --> 20:45.442
(grunts)

20:45.477 --> 20:46.676
(chuckles)

20:49.081 --> 20:50.680
Mulder, it's me.

20:50.716 --> 20:53.617
I can't believe I'm about to say
what I'm about to say, but...

20:53.652 --> 20:56.453
I think I just found
your horny toad lizard man.

20:56.488 --> 20:57.621
MULDER:
Really?

20:57.656 --> 20:58.622
Yeah.
(laughs)

20:58.657 --> 20:59.889
Where are you?

20:59.925 --> 21:02.125
At the phone store by the motel.

21:02.160 --> 21:03.460
I think he works here.

21:03.495 --> 21:04.794
I'll be right there.

21:04.830 --> 21:08.531
But, Mulder, I just got
an e-mail with the lab results,

21:08.567 --> 21:10.400
the blood tests from yesterday,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.236
and there are
some discrepancies.

21:13.272 --> 21:14.404
Mulder?

21:17.476 --> 21:19.476
(bell tinkles)

21:21.480 --> 21:23.480
Welcome to Smart Phones Is Us.

21:23.515 --> 21:24.881
How may I help?

21:24.916 --> 21:26.950
I'm wondering if I can ask you
some questions.

21:40.932 --> 21:42.299
- What the hell happened?
- I don't know.

21:42.334 --> 21:43.600
I came in
and I asked him

21:43.635 --> 21:44.668
if I could ask him
some questions,

21:44.703 --> 21:46.803
and he suddenly yelled,
"I quit"

21:46.838 --> 21:48.004
and he went
on a rampage.

21:48.040 --> 21:49.272
He fled out the back
through the stockroom.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.340
What are you doing?

21:50.375 --> 21:51.508
You know it's not safe

21:51.543 --> 21:53.009
to approach a dangerous suspect
without backup.

21:53.045 --> 21:54.244
Which way
did he go?

21:54.279 --> 21:56.146
He went that way,
down the back alley.

21:56.181 --> 21:59.149
But, Mulder, I got the results
back from the lab, and...

21:59.184 --> 22:00.483
(sighs)

22:00.519 --> 22:02.519
(crow caws)

22:32.050 --> 22:34.617
(birds twittering)

22:43.261 --> 22:45.462
Did you lose
somebody recently?

22:45.497 --> 22:47.464
Yeah.

22:47.499 --> 22:48.665
Myself.

22:50.102 --> 22:52.902
I know this
sounds weird, but...

22:52.938 --> 22:54.804
until a few days ago,
I didn't know we die.

22:54.840 --> 22:57.307
I mean, I always knew
we could die,

22:57.342 --> 22:59.576
I instinctively knew
to avoid death,

22:59.611 --> 23:02.712
but what
I didn't know is...

23:02.748 --> 23:04.180
no matter what we do,

23:04.216 --> 23:07.817
eventually you end up
in a place like this.

23:07.853 --> 23:10.520
It doesn't seem to make
a whole lot of sense, does it?

23:10.555 --> 23:12.322
It doesn't make any sense.

23:12.357 --> 23:14.224
Nothing makes sense.

23:14.259 --> 23:15.592
I don't mean
to intrude,

23:15.627 --> 23:18.361
but you seem to have something
weighing heavily on you.

23:18.397 --> 23:21.197
It might help to get it
off your chest.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.200
You mean... to confess?

23:24.236 --> 23:27.404
If you have something
to confess.

23:27.439 --> 23:29.672
Well, I confess that...

23:29.708 --> 23:31.441
if life is nonsense...

23:31.476 --> 23:33.676
I just want this madness to end.

23:33.712 --> 23:36.246
But you're not thinking of doing
anything crazy, are you?

23:36.281 --> 23:37.781
No.

23:37.816 --> 23:40.717
I'm just gonna... kill you.

23:41.887 --> 23:42.685
You ready?

23:47.159 --> 23:48.358
No, not the gun, you fool!

23:50.162 --> 23:51.027
You okay?

23:51.062 --> 23:52.095
Huh?

23:52.130 --> 23:53.263
Oh!

23:53.298 --> 23:54.964
Oh, no!
I've lost my weapon!

23:55.834 --> 23:57.434
Here.

23:59.271 --> 24:01.404
Come on, defend yourself!

24:01.440 --> 24:03.740
I know what you're
trying to do.

24:03.775 --> 24:06.276
The green glass, the appendix.

24:06.311 --> 24:07.944
But I'm not
gonna do it.

24:07.979 --> 24:08.812
I'm not gonna kill you.

24:10.582 --> 24:12.816
I want to help you.

24:12.851 --> 24:16.085
The only way you can help me,
mister, is...

24:16.121 --> 24:17.754
by killing me.

24:17.789 --> 24:19.456
Please.

24:19.491 --> 24:20.990
Just put me out of my misery.

24:23.528 --> 24:24.627
Okay.

24:24.663 --> 24:25.995
I'll do it.

24:26.031 --> 24:27.096
I'll kill you.

24:27.132 --> 24:29.933
Thanks, mister.

24:29.968 --> 24:32.836
You're, like, the only
nice person I've ever met!

24:32.871 --> 24:35.171
But first I want to hear
how this happened to you.

24:35.207 --> 24:37.006
(sighs)

24:37.042 --> 24:38.408
The whole story.

24:38.443 --> 24:40.009
Okay.

24:41.880 --> 24:44.080
But you're gonna need this.

24:45.517 --> 24:47.650
It's a shocker.

24:50.031 --> 24:52.698
(owl hooting)

24:54.234 --> 24:55.199
(twig cracks)

24:55.235 --> 24:57.035
MAN:
Stop!

24:57.070 --> 24:58.303
No! Aah!

25:00.240 --> 25:02.473
(yelling)

25:02.509 --> 25:04.509
(snarling, grunting)

25:05.578 --> 25:07.779
(roars)

25:07.814 --> 25:09.347
Aah!

25:10.684 --> 25:13.217
(whimpering)

25:13.253 --> 25:15.320
- Dude...
- (creature wailing)

25:15.355 --> 25:16.447
(whimpering)

25:16.623 --> 25:17.589
Wait.

25:17.624 --> 25:18.990
I'm confused already.

25:19.026 --> 25:20.592
You said you were going
to start at the beginning.

25:20.627 --> 25:21.660
I am.

25:21.695 --> 25:23.428
That's how the whole
thing started.

25:23.463 --> 25:25.964
I should have stayed
still, but I panicked.

25:25.999 --> 25:27.666
I tried to scare off
that predator.

25:27.701 --> 25:30.268
Of course, that only
made him more rabid.

25:30.304 --> 25:31.436
I didn't even
get a chance

25:31.471 --> 25:32.804
to shoot blood
out of my eyeballs.

25:32.839 --> 25:34.372
So you're saying

25:34.408 --> 25:35.774
a man bit you?

25:37.778 --> 25:39.411
That looks like a hickey.

25:39.446 --> 25:41.079
Well, it looks different
when I'm normal.

25:41.114 --> 25:44.916
Is this what you look like
when you're "normal"?

25:44.952 --> 25:46.618
What?

25:46.653 --> 25:47.953
Three eyes?

25:47.988 --> 25:51.089
But yeah, that's actually
quite close.

25:51.124 --> 25:53.358
So wh... when did you...

25:53.393 --> 25:55.827
first transform?

25:55.862 --> 25:57.629
Oh, that didn't happen
till the next morning.

26:00.233 --> 26:04.235
<i>My transformation wasn't
just physical but mental.</i>

26:05.906 --> 26:07.706
<i>I heard a voice in my head.</i>

26:07.741 --> 26:09.474
<i>My voice.</i>

26:09.509 --> 26:12.477
<i>I became conscious
of my own self-consciousness</i>

26:12.512 --> 26:14.446
<i>and then I had
my very first thought--</i>

26:14.481 --> 26:15.947
<i>"I'm naked!"</i>

26:15.983 --> 26:18.583
<i>I became overcome</i>

26:18.619 --> 26:21.286
<i>by some irrational need
to cover up.</i>

26:23.056 --> 26:24.356
<i>For some unknown reason,</i>

26:24.391 --> 26:26.391
<i>there was a bunch
of dead bodies lying around.</i>

26:30.564 --> 26:31.997
<i>Now, I had never
worn clothes before,</i>

26:32.032 --> 26:35.033
<i>but through
some primordial instinct, I...</i>

26:35.068 --> 26:37.002
<i>I knew how to put them on.</i>

26:37.037 --> 26:40.038
<i>Once clothed,
I became... possessed.</i>

26:40.073 --> 26:42.040
<i>I fought against it
as much as I could,</i>

26:42.075 --> 26:44.209
<i>but I lost control.</i>

26:44.244 --> 26:46.311
<i>I had to go on a hunt.</i>

26:46.346 --> 26:48.647
<i>I had to hunt down a... a...</i>

26:48.682 --> 26:49.848
A human victim?

26:49.883 --> 26:51.549
No, a job.

26:51.585 --> 26:53.318
Uh...

26:53.353 --> 26:55.186
My craze wouldn't
be satiated

26:55.222 --> 26:57.022
until I found steady work.

26:57.057 --> 26:58.923
So I walked
straight into town

26:58.959 --> 27:00.592
and rather tragically I...

27:00.627 --> 27:02.160
I found something right away.

27:02.195 --> 27:06.731
Now, this model comes with 3,000
gigabertz of pixelbitz...

27:06.767 --> 27:07.866
<i>It's perfect for me.</i>

27:07.901 --> 27:09.000
<i>I have no idea what I'm saying,</i>

27:09.036 --> 27:10.168
<i>and neither do my customers.</i>

27:10.203 --> 27:11.736
You can see from the shape of it

27:11.772 --> 27:12.937
that it's quite rectangular...

27:12.973 --> 27:15.273
<i>By the end of the day,
I was the manager.</i>

27:15.308 --> 27:17.008
Putting aside the logistics

27:17.044 --> 27:19.110
of no Social Security number,
no references...

27:19.146 --> 27:20.879
I don't need any of that stuff.

27:20.914 --> 27:23.314
You see, now I possess
the one Darwinian advantage

27:23.350 --> 27:25.750
that humans have
over other animals--

27:25.786 --> 27:27.919
the ability to BS my way
through anything.

27:27.954 --> 27:29.854
I mean,
it's better than camouflage!

27:29.890 --> 27:31.156
You wouldn't happen to be, uh,

27:31.191 --> 27:33.425
BSing me right now
about all this, would you?

27:33.460 --> 27:35.493
I don't know. Maybe.

27:35.529 --> 27:37.796
I don't understand half
the things I'm telling you.

27:37.831 --> 27:40.799
I find that... disconcerting.

27:40.834 --> 27:42.367
What's even more disturbing

27:42.402 --> 27:44.903
is what I did after work
that first day.

27:44.938 --> 27:46.938
I was so exhausted,

27:46.973 --> 27:50.208
out of my mind, I...

27:50.243 --> 27:51.209
I committed a murder.

27:51.244 --> 27:52.977
Who did you kill?

27:53.013 --> 27:54.913
A cow.

27:54.948 --> 27:58.183
I'd like a double cheeseburger
and a large order of fries.

27:58.218 --> 27:59.984
CLERK:
Sir, if you're not in a car,

28:00.020 --> 28:01.486
you have to come inside
to order.

28:01.521 --> 28:02.987
Why?

28:03.023 --> 28:04.756
In your natural state,

28:04.791 --> 28:06.091
you're a vegetarian?

28:06.126 --> 28:07.625
No, an insectivore.

28:07.661 --> 28:08.960
But no one
likes insects,

28:08.995 --> 28:10.662
not even other insects.

28:10.697 --> 28:13.331
Anyway, I-I
took my kill,

28:13.366 --> 28:14.733
checked into a motel,

28:14.768 --> 28:17.469
and then I just spent
the rest of the day

28:17.504 --> 28:20.505
helplessly watching... porn.

28:20.540 --> 28:22.440
(porn music playing)

28:33.153 --> 28:34.619
<i>But then,
sometime during the night,</i>

28:34.654 --> 28:36.087
<i>a change occurred.</i>

28:37.657 --> 28:39.657
(TV shuts off)

28:50.537 --> 28:52.337
Yeah, all right!

28:52.372 --> 28:53.772
(laughing)

28:56.576 --> 28:58.109
Come on.

28:58.145 --> 28:59.544
Whoo, yeah!

28:59.579 --> 29:01.546
I'm back, baby!

29:01.581 --> 29:04.015
(whooping)

29:04.050 --> 29:06.384
<i>I was myself again.</i>

29:06.419 --> 29:08.586
<i>And everything was fine...</i>

29:08.622 --> 29:11.222
<i>until the next morning.</i>

29:11.258 --> 29:13.258
(snoring, alarm ringing)

29:35.882 --> 29:37.882
(groans quietly)

29:43.924 --> 29:45.089
Coffee.

29:45.125 --> 29:46.224
Need coffee.

29:48.195 --> 29:50.195
<i>Alas, I was human again.</i>

29:58.705 --> 30:00.438
<i>I went back to work.</i>

30:00.473 --> 30:01.873
<i>But now that I had a job,</i>

30:01.908 --> 30:04.375
<i>all I could think about
was how much I hated my job.</i>

30:05.545 --> 30:06.878
Oh, that's it. I quit!

30:11.384 --> 30:13.685
<i>But I was too overcome
with human fear to quit.</i>

30:13.720 --> 30:15.353
<i>How would I pay my bills?</i>

30:15.388 --> 30:17.789
<i>Without a job,
I'd-I'd never get a loan</i>

30:17.824 --> 30:20.458
<i>and start a mortgage,
whatever that is.</i>

30:20.493 --> 30:21.993
<i>Already I was terrified</i>

30:22.028 --> 30:24.028
<i>I wasn't saving enough
for my retirement.</i>

30:24.064 --> 30:25.964
And what else
was I supposed to do?

30:25.999 --> 30:27.966
If I haven't written
my novel by now,

30:28.001 --> 30:29.634
I'm never going to write it,
you know?

30:29.669 --> 30:31.236
I just couldn't
go on.

30:31.271 --> 30:33.938
So I...
I visited a witch doctor.

30:33.974 --> 30:36.074
Psychiatrist.

30:36.109 --> 30:37.275
Ah.

30:37.310 --> 30:38.977
But the medicine he gave me
didn't cure me,

30:39.012 --> 30:41.546
it just clouded
my thoughts.

30:41.581 --> 30:42.881
And as a result, I...

30:42.916 --> 30:44.215
I did something insane.

30:44.251 --> 30:45.984
You attacked and killed someone?

30:46.019 --> 30:47.485
No, I got a puppy!

30:47.520 --> 30:49.487
<i>I named him Daggoo.</i>

30:49.522 --> 30:50.555
Daggoo!

30:50.590 --> 30:51.789
Daggoo!

30:51.825 --> 30:52.891
Daggoo.

30:52.926 --> 30:54.259
<i>And I quickly realized</i>

30:54.294 --> 30:55.860
<i>that the only way
to be happy as a human</i>

30:55.896 --> 30:57.228
<i>was to spend all of your time</i>

30:57.264 --> 31:00.064
<i>in the company of non-humans.</i>

31:00.100 --> 31:01.766
(barks)

31:01.801 --> 31:03.134
<i>We played
all through the night.</i>

31:03.169 --> 31:04.736
<i>But the next day,</i>

31:04.771 --> 31:06.671
<i>when I came home from work...</i>

31:06.706 --> 31:08.673
Daggoo, I'm home!

31:08.708 --> 31:09.841
Daggoo?

31:12.779 --> 31:14.212
Daggoo!

31:14.247 --> 31:17.081
<i>...well, I guess the maid must
have accidentally let him out.</i>

31:17.117 --> 31:18.950
Daggoo!

31:18.985 --> 31:21.052
Daggoo!

31:21.087 --> 31:23.321
<i>I searched everywhere.
All night long.</i>

31:23.356 --> 31:26.157
<i>But it was hopeless.</i>

31:26.192 --> 31:27.392
Daggoo!

31:27.427 --> 31:28.726
<i>Because life's hopeless.</i>

31:28.762 --> 31:30.995
<i>A few fleeting
moments of happiness,</i>

31:31.031 --> 31:33.598
<i>surrounded by
crushing loss and grief.</i>

31:33.633 --> 31:36.200
Daggoo!

31:36.236 --> 31:37.669
Daggoo...

31:37.704 --> 31:39.671
<i>Why bother?</i>

31:39.706 --> 31:41.839
(sobbing)

31:44.411 --> 31:46.477
Just when
I'd given up the search...

31:46.513 --> 31:47.879
I saw <i> him.</i>

31:47.914 --> 31:49.013
Daggoo?!

31:49.049 --> 31:50.315
No.

31:50.350 --> 31:51.649
No, the man who had bit me

31:51.685 --> 31:52.884
and turned me into a human.

31:52.919 --> 31:55.787
<i>Just catching sight
of that son of a bitch</i>

31:55.822 --> 31:57.455
<i>made me even more human,</i>

31:57.490 --> 32:00.058
<i>because I was filled
with the one thing</i>

32:00.093 --> 32:02.327
<i>that only humans can
understand-- revenge.</i>

32:02.362 --> 32:04.529
<i>I got up
and I stalked after him.</i>

32:04.564 --> 32:06.197
- I just wanted to...
- Strangle him and eat his flesh?

32:06.232 --> 32:07.465
Yes!

32:07.500 --> 32:08.833
Now we're getting somewhere.

32:08.868 --> 32:10.802
But just as I was
about to do that...

32:10.837 --> 32:13.905
<i>I saw him do the same thing
to someone else.</i>

32:15.742 --> 32:17.408
(man grunts, yells)

32:17.444 --> 32:19.510
<i>I'd never seen
such pointless brutality.</i>

32:23.750 --> 32:25.049
<i>I was so transfixed
by the horror</i>

32:25.085 --> 32:26.851
<i>that I didn't notice
the moon had come out.</i>

32:30.790 --> 32:32.056
<i>But having caught a glimpse</i>

32:32.092 --> 32:33.558
<i>of what human nature
was capable of,</i>

32:33.593 --> 32:35.259
<i>I wanted no more part of it.</i>

32:35.295 --> 32:37.762
<i>I decided to shed my clothes
and return to the wild!</i>

32:40.567 --> 32:42.567
(screaming)

32:42.602 --> 32:44.736
<i>Man, she hit like a man.</i>

32:46.806 --> 32:49.040
That's because she used to be...

32:49.075 --> 32:50.842
uh, she once...

32:50.877 --> 32:52.543
She's transgender.

32:52.579 --> 32:53.778
What?

32:53.813 --> 32:55.113
You can't transform
into a different sex!

32:55.148 --> 32:56.114
That's nuts!

32:56.149 --> 32:57.415
It's not nuts.

32:57.450 --> 32:59.050
It's actually a very common
medical procedure.

32:59.085 --> 33:00.251
You don't need the surgery,
technically...

33:00.286 --> 33:01.986
Maybe that's what I could do!

33:02.022 --> 33:03.121
- It's a cure!
- No.

33:03.156 --> 33:04.422
Well, I've got
to stop transforming.

33:04.457 --> 33:05.823
I'll do
the surgery.

33:05.859 --> 33:06.824
Completely different.

33:06.860 --> 33:07.959
I don't care
how much it costs,

33:07.994 --> 33:08.926
I'll do it.

33:08.962 --> 33:11.062
They cut off your genitals.

33:13.099 --> 33:14.732
Nah, I'll leave it.

33:14.768 --> 33:16.334
That's... that's a step too far,
isn't it?

33:16.369 --> 33:18.002
- Yeah.
- Okay.

33:18.038 --> 33:20.071
Well, anyway, I think
she gave me a concussion.

33:20.106 --> 33:22.273
Rest of the night's
pretty foggy.

33:22.308 --> 33:25.143
Some people chased me
around a truck,

33:25.178 --> 33:27.145
and a man took a picture of me
in the Porta Potti.

33:27.180 --> 33:29.313
That was me, actually.

33:29.349 --> 33:32.316
I thought I recognized you!

33:32.352 --> 33:34.552
But wait... how could you have
changed back into a man?

33:34.587 --> 33:36.054
It wasn't morning yet.

33:36.089 --> 33:38.289
I don't know how it works.
I'm not a scientist.

33:38.324 --> 33:40.758
I'm just looking for
some kind of internal logic.

33:40.794 --> 33:42.026
Why?

33:42.062 --> 33:44.062
There isn't an external logic
to any of it.

33:44.097 --> 33:45.797
I mean, I went
back to the motel,

33:45.832 --> 33:48.499
and a jackalope head on the wall
started screaming at me.

33:48.535 --> 33:49.901
Explain that.

33:49.936 --> 33:51.936
And I'm creeped out
by jackalopes,

33:51.971 --> 33:53.905
ever since a friend of mine
got gored by one.

33:53.940 --> 33:55.740
Jackalopes aren't real.

33:55.775 --> 33:57.975
They-they were
a hoax perpetrated by

33:58.011 --> 34:00.578
a Wyoming taxidermist in 1932.

34:00.613 --> 34:02.113
They... they don't exist.

34:02.148 --> 34:03.614
Well, I'd like to see
you explain that

34:03.650 --> 34:04.649
to my dead friend, George!

34:04.684 --> 34:06.617
Anyway,

34:06.653 --> 34:08.351
I fled the motel,

34:08.388 --> 34:10.288
turned into a human again
the next morning

34:10.322 --> 34:11.621
and went into work.

34:11.658 --> 34:13.224
(bell tinkles)

34:13.259 --> 34:14.625
Welcome to Smart Phones Is Us.

34:14.661 --> 34:16.226
How may I help?

34:16.262 --> 34:18.196
I'm wondering if I can
ask you some questions.

34:18.231 --> 34:19.362
Mm-hmm?

34:19.399 --> 34:20.998
I think maybe my phone
isn't working right,

34:21.034 --> 34:24.335
'cause guys don't send me
pictures of their junk on it.

34:25.839 --> 34:29.139
I think maybe I'd like to...
take a picture of yours.

34:29.175 --> 34:30.842
(porn music playing)

34:32.745 --> 34:34.645
Come on.

34:34.681 --> 34:37.949
I want to make you say "cheese."

34:39.219 --> 34:41.219
(Scully gasping,
moaning in pleasure)

34:43.022 --> 34:44.856
You're an animal!

34:44.891 --> 34:46.891
An animal!

34:46.926 --> 34:48.525
This feels good!

34:48.561 --> 34:50.728
Oh, don't stop!

34:50.763 --> 34:51.728
Don't...

34:51.764 --> 34:52.563
Stop.

34:53.933 --> 34:57.401
That... did not happen.

34:57.437 --> 34:59.170
I know it's hard
to believe,

34:59.205 --> 35:01.672
but apparently
I'm terrific in the sack.

35:01.708 --> 35:03.040
You made that up.

35:05.011 --> 35:07.612
Oh... all right, you got me.

35:07.647 --> 35:08.946
Ever since I became a human,

35:08.982 --> 35:10.681
I can't help but lie
about my sex life.

35:10.717 --> 35:13.351
But that's the only
untruthful bit

35:13.386 --> 35:14.886
in the whole story.

35:14.921 --> 35:16.087
So please...

35:16.122 --> 35:19.056
will you kill me now?

35:20.727 --> 35:23.027
You don't believe me, do you?

35:23.062 --> 35:24.695
I thought I was going
to believe you,

35:24.731 --> 35:25.863
but it's all...

35:25.899 --> 35:28.499
it's just too... fantastic.

35:28.535 --> 35:30.134
It's not fantastic.

35:30.170 --> 35:31.235
It's tragic!

35:31.271 --> 35:34.505
No, I mean it's just... silly.

35:34.541 --> 35:36.174
That's my life
you're talking about.

35:36.209 --> 35:37.875
It's my life, too.

35:37.911 --> 35:40.044
You and me, we're the same, Guy.

35:40.079 --> 35:42.747
We both want to believe
in things that aren't real

35:42.782 --> 35:44.582
or even possible.

35:44.617 --> 35:46.350
"There are more things
in Heaven and Earth,

35:46.386 --> 35:47.552
than are dreamt of in..."

35:47.587 --> 35:49.120
"...your philosophy."
I know that.

35:49.155 --> 35:51.756
Ah, but did you know
the First Folio version reads--

35:51.791 --> 35:54.258
"than are dreamt of
in <i> our</i> philosophy"?

35:54.294 --> 35:57.795
So Hamlet is not just calling
Horatio an ignorant idiot,

35:57.830 --> 35:59.864
he's calling us all
ignorant idiots?

35:59.899 --> 36:01.799
It's a comforting thought,
isn't it?

36:01.834 --> 36:04.101
Because if there's
nothing more to life

36:04.137 --> 36:05.970
than what we already know,

36:06.005 --> 36:08.639
then there's nothing but...
worries,

36:08.675 --> 36:10.741
self-doubt,

36:10.777 --> 36:12.076
regret

36:12.111 --> 36:14.879
and loneliness.

36:14.914 --> 36:16.380
(sighs)

36:16.416 --> 36:17.548
Foxman,

36:17.584 --> 36:19.917
you've got to put me
out of my misery!

36:19.953 --> 36:22.053
I don't want to wake up tomorrow
and have to go to work!

36:24.624 --> 36:27.291
What the hell's this?

36:27.327 --> 36:28.726
You're the fuzz?

36:28.761 --> 36:31.629
I'm in town
investigating the murders.

36:31.664 --> 36:33.130
And you think
I'd do something like that?

36:34.334 --> 36:36.400
What kind of a monster
do you think I am?

36:36.436 --> 36:38.569
You didn't want
to help me,

36:38.605 --> 36:40.905
you just wanted to arrest me
for something I didn't do.

36:40.940 --> 36:44.609
Who takes advantage
of someone like that?

36:44.644 --> 36:48.579
A human, that's who.

36:48.615 --> 36:51.182
Human rat fink!

36:51.217 --> 36:52.383
I'm not delusional.

36:52.418 --> 36:53.651
I know what I am.

36:53.686 --> 36:55.253
I'm no monster.

36:55.288 --> 36:56.654
You're the monster!

36:56.689 --> 36:59.156
<i>J'accuse Monsieur Mulder!</i>

37:01.327 --> 37:02.760
Run for your lives!

37:02.795 --> 37:03.794
There's a monster!

37:04.831 --> 37:06.664
Run!

37:06.699 --> 37:08.299
Monster!

37:08.334 --> 37:11.035
Monster!

37:20.262 --> 37:23.262
(theme song ringtone playing)

37:27.802 --> 37:28.768
Hey, Scully.

37:28.803 --> 37:31.504
Hey, Mulder,
where have you been?

37:31.539 --> 37:35.041
I fell off the wagon, Scully.

37:35.076 --> 37:37.710
I got a little taste
of my old monster-hunting ways

37:37.745 --> 37:39.445
and then I downed
the whole bottle.

37:39.481 --> 37:41.647
I take it you found
your were-lizard?

37:41.683 --> 37:43.749
Yeah, it turns out it wasn't
a man who turns into a lizard,

37:43.785 --> 37:45.351
it was a lizard
who turns into a man.

37:45.386 --> 37:47.019
I don't see the difference.

37:47.055 --> 37:48.921
That's the point, Scully,
there is no difference.

37:48.957 --> 37:50.957
Both scenarios
are equally foolish.

37:50.992 --> 37:53.359
And I was foolish to believe...

37:53.394 --> 37:56.796
well, maybe I was
just a fool, Scully.

37:56.831 --> 37:58.631
Maybe I always have been.

38:00.301 --> 38:01.100
Where are you?

38:01.135 --> 38:02.635
I'm at the animal shelter.

38:02.670 --> 38:03.636
I'm waiting to see

38:03.671 --> 38:05.605
that animal control officer.

38:05.640 --> 38:07.840
So he didn't quit
after all, huh?

38:07.876 --> 38:09.976
No, I guess maybe he's like us.

38:10.011 --> 38:11.611
Some jobs keep pulling you back.

38:12.413 --> 38:13.679
Ow! Oh!

38:13.715 --> 38:15.681
What was that? What happened?

38:15.717 --> 38:17.850
This little puppy here just
tried to take a bite out of me.

38:20.722 --> 38:22.054
A bite?

38:22.090 --> 38:23.556
He's a cute little guy, though.

38:23.591 --> 38:25.892
Kind of reminds me of Queequeg.

38:28.062 --> 38:30.029
You know, there was a recent
comparative cognition study

38:30.064 --> 38:32.064
that showed
that dogs

38:32.100 --> 38:34.667
hold hostilities toward people
that harm their masters?

38:35.770 --> 38:37.136
I mean, I guess maybe

38:37.171 --> 38:38.504
I miss having a dog to love...

38:39.574 --> 38:40.540
...and someone to hold

38:40.575 --> 38:41.841
my grudges for me.

38:45.113 --> 38:46.112
- (crashing)
- Scully?

38:48.416 --> 38:49.849
This is Agent Mulder
with the FBI.

38:49.851 --> 38:51.851
I need emergency backup
to the animal control shelter.

38:53.321 --> 38:55.421
And where the hell is
the animal control shelter?

38:55.423 --> 38:57.423
Scully!

38:57.425 --> 38:58.591
(dog barks)

38:58.593 --> 39:00.092
(indistinct radio transmission)

39:00.094 --> 39:01.627
SCULLY:
Hey.

39:01.629 --> 39:03.930
You missed all the fun.

39:03.932 --> 39:05.197
Are you okay?

39:05.199 --> 39:06.532
Yeah, but I hate
to disappoint you.

39:06.534 --> 39:08.901
It wasn't some monster
running around, killing people

39:08.903 --> 39:09.902
and eating their flesh;

39:09.904 --> 39:11.404
it was a normal human being.

39:11.406 --> 39:13.406
Did you know it was him
before coming here?

39:13.408 --> 39:14.574
SCULLY:
Yeah.

39:14.576 --> 39:16.609
That one autopsy result
showed that

39:16.611 --> 39:18.644
the actual cause of death
was strangulation.

39:18.646 --> 39:20.079
And so, on a hunch,

39:20.081 --> 39:21.814
I analyzed the pole
that he left behind,

39:21.816 --> 39:23.716
and there was tissue and blood
from previous victims.

39:24.819 --> 39:26.686
It all started
when I was a child...

39:26.688 --> 39:30.356
this uncontrollable urge
to torture small animals.

39:30.358 --> 39:31.791
As I got older,
my compulsion didn't vanish...

39:31.793 --> 39:33.626
Okay, all right.
Leave it for the trial.

39:33.628 --> 39:35.294
You're right, Mulder--

39:35.296 --> 39:37.496
you've seen one serial killer,
you've seen them all.

39:37.498 --> 39:39.332
But I have a whole speech
prepared

39:39.334 --> 39:41.601
- that I...
- Come on.

39:41.603 --> 39:43.235
(dog barking, chicken clucking)

39:43.237 --> 39:44.570
Scully, that is
the second time

39:44.572 --> 39:46.839
you've approached a dangerous
suspect without backup.

39:46.841 --> 39:48.341
What's going on?

39:48.343 --> 39:50.209
Thought maybe you'd want
some more quality time

39:50.211 --> 39:52.311
with your lizard man.

39:52.313 --> 39:55.181
Besides, you forget--
I'm immortal.

39:55.183 --> 39:56.849
Oh.

39:56.851 --> 40:00.319
Mulder, how did you figure out
it was him?

40:00.321 --> 40:01.954
Oh, I was going over
those photos I took

40:01.956 --> 40:03.422
and I realized one
was of a bite mark,

40:03.424 --> 40:04.957
so if Guy's story
were true,

40:04.959 --> 40:06.392
it means he must have
been bitten by...

40:09.664 --> 40:11.297
If Guy's story were true?

40:15.136 --> 40:17.303
(barks)

40:17.305 --> 40:18.938
Hey, buddy.

40:18.940 --> 40:20.306
You want to come home with me?

40:23.378 --> 40:25.378
(birds singing,
insects trilling)

40:33.554 --> 40:34.987
Guy!

40:34.989 --> 40:36.088
Hey, Guy.

40:38.226 --> 40:39.825
We caught the killer.

40:39.827 --> 40:41.193
So?

40:41.195 --> 40:42.495
So... for
a while there,

40:42.497 --> 40:43.729
I thought maybe
it was you.

40:43.731 --> 40:45.898
Well, thanks... I guess.

40:45.900 --> 40:48.000
It means that I...
I know now...

40:48.002 --> 40:50.803
you were telling the truth.

40:50.805 --> 40:53.272
Sounds like you're still unsure.

40:53.274 --> 40:56.308
Well, you have to admit,
it's, uh...

40:56.310 --> 40:57.643
it's a little absurd.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.945
A little bit absurd?

40:59.947 --> 41:02.114
It's a lot absurd.

41:02.116 --> 41:03.883
I mean, look at this thing.

41:03.885 --> 41:05.151
Whose genius idea was it

41:05.153 --> 41:07.153
to tie a piece of cloth
around your neck?

41:07.155 --> 41:09.155
It's waiting
to strangle you.

41:09.157 --> 41:11.223
Do you want a hat?

41:11.225 --> 41:13.392
No.

41:13.394 --> 41:14.927
What are you doing?

41:14.929 --> 41:17.563
This is the time for my kind
to go into hibernation.

41:17.565 --> 41:22.001
I'm hoping I won't turn
into a human again during it,

41:22.003 --> 41:24.003
and maybe when I wake up again,

41:24.005 --> 41:26.739
I will have slept off this
whole transformation thing.

41:26.741 --> 41:29.075
I didn't know that,
uh, reptiles hibernated.

41:29.077 --> 41:31.210
Whoa. I'm not a reptile.

41:31.212 --> 41:32.411
That's racist!

41:32.413 --> 41:34.113
O-O-Okay... Okay.

41:34.115 --> 41:37.049
How-how long
do you hibernate for?

41:37.051 --> 41:38.684
Well, I never really did
get the hang

41:38.686 --> 41:40.853
of human constructs of time.

41:40.855 --> 41:42.054
Let me see...

41:42.056 --> 41:44.724
Uh, lunar cycles,
you got four of those,

41:44.726 --> 41:46.592
then you got
your seasons, just...

41:46.594 --> 41:49.128
10,000 years.

41:49.130 --> 41:52.598
That's... not possible.

41:52.600 --> 41:56.268
There you go again,
not believing me!

41:59.874 --> 42:01.574
I want to believe.

42:10.718 --> 42:12.518
I don't mean to get
too personal, but...

42:14.489 --> 42:17.256
...this has been
a real trying time for me.

42:17.258 --> 42:18.591
I've been through a lot.

42:18.593 --> 42:21.961
But just having
someone like you to...

42:23.998 --> 42:26.065
Look, what I'm trying
to say is...

42:26.067 --> 42:27.900
I'm glad to have met you.

42:34.342 --> 42:35.975
Like...

42:56.998 --> 42:58.931
Likewise.
