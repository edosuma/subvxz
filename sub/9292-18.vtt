00:14.360 --> 00:15.873
Evelyn, I need you to stay focused.

00:15.960 --> 00:19.157
The recording of the call
between Logan and Henderson

00:19.240 --> 00:21.435
is in a safety deposit box. Which bank?

00:21.520 --> 00:23.670
City Trust and Savings in Agoura Hills.

00:23.760 --> 00:27.673
Jack knows there's no point
going public until he has proof.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.672
None of this should have happened. This
thing was planned to make our country safer.

00:30.760 --> 00:34.435
And it all spiralled out of control
when you decided to kill David Palmer.

00:34.520 --> 00:37.830
We have to focus on stopping Bauer
before he finds that recording.

00:38.200 --> 00:43.513
Karen, I'm issuing an executive order for the
immediate apprehension and arrest of Bauer.

00:43.600 --> 00:47.195
I want you to run point on this,
and make it CTU'S top priority.

00:47.280 --> 00:48.713
Understood, sir.

00:49.240 --> 00:50.798
If we really want to find Bauer,

00:50.880 --> 00:53.952
we need to keep watch on
anyone he might contact for help,

00:54.040 --> 00:55.712
starting with Audrey Raines.

00:55.800 --> 00:58.360
Don't fill your father in on the particulars.
Just set up the meeting.

00:58.440 --> 01:00.078
1%1 call back when I have the recording.

01:00.160 --> 01:01.673
I need to see you in person.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.638
Can you reroute your plane to Los Angeles?

01:04.720 --> 01:06.597
- All right, yes.
- I'll see you there.

01:07.120 --> 01:10.829
Jack. Are you aware Logan's
issued a warrant for your arrest?

01:10.920 --> 01:12.911
The vice president's not behind this, is he?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.399
No, it's Logan.

01:14.480 --> 01:19.759
When we have the evidence,
we'll give it to the Secretary of Defense.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.116
- It had to be done.
- I decide what needs to be done.

01:23.200 --> 01:25.191
I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.

01:25.280 --> 01:26.235
We got what we need.

01:26.320 --> 01:30.472
The instant that Bauer
steps outside that bank, you take him down,

01:30.560 --> 01:33.233
kill the others and get the recording.

01:49.360 --> 01:50.270
We got the evidence.

01:50.360 --> 01:53.158
- Have you listened to it?
- Yeah, there's no doubt it's Logan.

01:53.240 --> 01:56.869
We're talking about taking down
the President of the United States.

02:03.480 --> 02:07.598
This checkpoint isjust one of many
that have been in place for several hours now.

02:07.680 --> 02:11.753
Despite his announcement that Los Angeles
is no longer under threat of attack,

02:11.840 --> 02:16.038
President Logan has ordered
that martial law remain in eject.

02:16.120 --> 02:19.669
While the move has drawn criticism
from civil rights advocates,

02:19.760 --> 02:23.150
the president is defending his decision
as a necessatyprecaution.

02:30.640 --> 02:32.870
- Yes.
- It's me.

02:33.400 --> 02:36.676
- Is Bauer dead?
- Not yet, Mr President.

02:36.760 --> 02:39.911
- You said your men had him.
- Bauer triggered the bank alarm.

02:40.000 --> 02:44.630
Authorities came before my men could get
to him. Bauer used the fire fight to slip away.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.870
- He has the recording?
- Yes, sir.

02:46.960 --> 02:51.476
That evidence directly implicates me
in David Palmer's death.

02:51.560 --> 02:55.633
If it gets to someone who can do something
about it. We'll have Bauer before that.

02:55.720 --> 02:59.315
- How?
- You have established control over CTU.

02:59.400 --> 03:01.789
CTU is heading up the search effort for Bauer.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.950
You put a lot of faith in their ability.

03:04.040 --> 03:07.157
This city is locked down. CTU will find Bauer.

03:07.240 --> 03:12.837
And when they do, make sure you're
the first to know so my men can intercept.

03:25.840 --> 03:29.230
- Yes, Mr President?
- Get me Karen Hayes at CTU.

03:29.320 --> 03:32.596
We're sifting satellite and Caltrans video
for Audrey's vehicle.

03:32.680 --> 03:35.956
I've distributed her photo
to checkpoints throughout the city.

03:36.040 --> 03:39.237
If she used her DOD credentials,
there should be a record.

03:39.320 --> 03:43.154
I hope we're not wasting our resources.
We don't know she's helping Bauer.

03:43.240 --> 03:46.869
She dumped the tracker. There's a reason
she doesn't want to be followed.

03:46.960 --> 03:51.112
Ms Hayes,
the president is on line one.

03:51.200 --> 03:53.350
- Yes, Mr President?
- Where are we, Ms Hayes?

03:53.440 --> 03:56.477
Still running active manhunts
on both Bauer and Henderson.

03:56.560 --> 03:59.199
- I told you to prioritize Bauer.
- I have, sir.

03:59.280 --> 04:01.475
I've allocated my resources accordingly.

04:01.560 --> 04:04.358
If Palmer's killer is free
when the news cycle begins,

04:04.440 --> 04:08.433
then all the success we've had
handling these terrorists will be undermined.

04:08.520 --> 04:10.351
I will find Bauer, sir.

04:10.440 --> 04:12.510
You let me know the moment you do.

04:12.600 --> 04:14.591
Yes, Mr President.

04:15.160 --> 04:17.435
Bauer, right?

04:17.519 --> 04:22.196
Raines knows where he is. Those protocols
aren't donna be enough to track her.

04:22.280 --> 04:25.829
- Chloe helped her break surveillance?
- I'm sure of it.

04:25.920 --> 04:29.959
Remember, Audrey insisted
Chloe be assigned to her.

04:30.040 --> 04:35.239
- Then we need to confront Chloe.
- No, no, no, no, no. She'll just deny it.

04:35.320 --> 04:38.073
There's a way we can use her to find Bauer.

04:51.120 --> 04:52.439
Jack.

04:53.880 --> 04:56.952
Bill Buchanan. Wayne Palmer.

04:57.040 --> 05:00.112
I'm sorry about your brother.
What the hell's going on, Jack?

05:00.200 --> 05:03.954
Every law enforcement agency across
this counts has a warrant for my arrest.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.838
- What for?
- Killing David Palmer.

05:06.920 --> 05:08.911
We cleared you this morning.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.878
I'm being set up again.
This time by President Logan.

05:11.960 --> 05:14.838
He was compliant
in David Palmer's assassination.

05:17.520 --> 05:21.433
- My God, you're serious.
- Logan's trying to stop me exposing him.

05:21.520 --> 05:26.548
We have the evidence. A digital recording of a
conversation between Logan and Henderson.

05:26.640 --> 05:29.791
Secretary Heller will take it
to the attorney general.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.713
They'll file for the warrant,
but I think Wayne's a target.

05:32.800 --> 05:36.236
- I need you to take him somewhere safe.
- Of course I will.

05:36.320 --> 05:40.359
- Where you donna meet Heller?
- Van Nuys airport.

05:54.840 --> 05:57.718
- Yeah?
- Jack. My father landed. Where are you?

05:57.800 --> 06:00.951
I dropped Wayne off with Buchanan.
I'm on my way to the airport.

06:01.040 --> 06:05.272
All right. I'm on the north side
of the emergency runway at hangar, uh, 112.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.590
- I'll be there in a few minutes.
- Hurry.

06:54.480 --> 06:55.959
Dad.

06:56.920 --> 06:59.639
- Hi, sweetheart.
- H i.

07:00.120 --> 07:02.111
Thank you so much for doing this.

07:02.200 --> 07:05.556
Well, I don't know what it is I'm doing,
so don't thank me yet.

07:05.640 --> 07:08.473
These men in your security detail,
do you trust them?

07:08.560 --> 07:12.519
- With my life.
- I need to be sure that they are loyal to you.

07:12.600 --> 07:15.717
What's going on?

07:18.880 --> 07:22.270
Dad, I will tell you but only you.

07:22.360 --> 07:24.351
Stay here.

07:25.720 --> 07:30.032
You know I don't like to be kept in the dark.
Tell me what this is all about.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.033
I promise I will. I just need a minute.

07:34.520 --> 07:37.398
- Mr Secretary.
- What the hell are you doing here?

07:37.480 --> 07:41.758
He's a fugitive. Every law enforcement
agency in the state is looking for him.

07:41.840 --> 07:44.559
- He's innocent.
- Then why don't you turn yourself in?

07:44.640 --> 07:49.031
I swear to you, I had nothing to do
with David Palmer's assassination.

07:49.120 --> 07:52.317
I'd like to believe you,
but you're acting like a criminal.

07:52.400 --> 07:55.073
I don't have a choice. They're setting me up.

07:55.160 --> 07:58.072
Mr Secretary,
I only need you for a few minutes.

07:58.160 --> 08:00.754
I need to show you something, but privately.

08:00.840 --> 08:02.956
Inside the building. Please.

08:07.720 --> 08:09.915
Thank you, sir.

08:25.360 --> 08:28.636
<i>- It had to be done.
- I decide what needs to be done.</i>

08:28.720 --> 08:31.712
<i>I never authorized you to kill David Palmer.</i>

08:31.800 --> 08:35.395
- President Logan?
- And a man named Christopher Henderson.

08:35.480 --> 08:39.553
<i>- For God's sake, sir, he called your wife.
- I can handle my wife.</i>

08:39.640 --> 08:43.269
<i>My concern is stopping this operation
collapsing like a house of cards.</i>

08:43.360 --> 08:46.477
All threads end with Cummings.

08:46.560 --> 08:49.313
He thinks he's running this.
Keep playing it that way.

08:49.400 --> 08:53.996
I know my part, Mr Henderson.
Youjust do as youre told.

08:56.560 --> 08:59.757
Logan supplied the terrorists
with the Sentox nerve gas.

08:59.840 --> 09:03.230
- What?
- He planned to deploy it en route to Moscow.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.788
He could use the terrorists as an excuse

09:05.880 --> 09:10.158
to invoke the military terms of the agreement
that he made earlier with Suvarov.

09:10.240 --> 09:13.516
This was all to gain control
of the oil supply in Central Asia.

09:13.600 --> 09:17.229
David Palmer found out about it,
and that's why they killed him.

09:17.320 --> 09:19.629
How do you know
that hasn't been fabricated?

09:19.720 --> 09:25.397
I trust the source. Mr Secretary, I promise
you, this will stand up under scrutiny.

09:25.480 --> 09:29.314
I wish I could say I was surprised, but I'm not.

09:29.400 --> 09:33.951
I watched Charles Logan
rise on the tide of his own ambition.

09:34.040 --> 09:36.918
I was terrified when he took the oath.

09:37.000 --> 09:40.629
I'm sorry I had to involve you,
but I needed someone who had access

09:40.720 --> 09:43.154
to hand-deliver this to the attorney general.

09:43.240 --> 09:47.711
- So you contacted me.
- You're the only one I can trust.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.510
All right, then.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.034
Thank you, sir.

10:01.960 --> 10:05.555
Go with your father. He'll need someone
to corroborate the evidence.

10:05.640 --> 10:10.839
- What about you?
- I'm donna go dark. I'll let Buchanan know.

10:10.920 --> 10:14.595
All right.
Jack, everyth i ng's gon na be OK now.

10:14.680 --> 10:16.875
- Go.
- OK.

10:21.000 --> 10:23.560
- Jack, one more thing.
- What, sir?

10:25.680 --> 10:28.194
- Dad, what are you doing?!
- Secure my daughter.

10:28.280 --> 10:32.159
You're playing a dangerous game here, Jack,
and you're playing it wrong.

10:32.240 --> 10:36.518
Turning Logan's crime into a public spectacle
will not bring back David Palmer.

10:36.600 --> 10:42.596
It'll tear this nation apart.
You'll be destroying the presidency.

10:42.960 --> 10:46.919
The collateral damage of the truth
will cripple this nation.

10:47.000 --> 10:49.753
So what are you donna do?
Bury the evidence?

10:49.840 --> 10:52.593
No. You're coming with me, Audrey.

10:52.680 --> 10:57.037
We'll use the evidence
to get Logan to step down quietly.

10:57.120 --> 11:00.396
Once he's gone,
we'll have a chance to set things right again.

11:00.480 --> 11:05.759
Doug, I'm trusting you to keep this item safe.
She's coming with me.

11:05.840 --> 11:08.115
Dad, I can't.

11:08.200 --> 11:12.830
- Secure them both until you hear from me.
- Dad, please, no!

11:12.920 --> 11:16.549
Mr Secretary! You can't make a deal with him!

11:17.480 --> 11:19.630
You can't trust him!

11:37.160 --> 11:39.355
What's going on in the situation room?

11:39.440 --> 11:41.237
- It's a briefing.
- No one told me.

11:41.320 --> 11:45.108
- It's a class three.
- I'm a department head. I should be in there.

11:45.200 --> 11:47.475
It's all I know.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.955
- Shari, what was that briefing about?
- Just a protocol review.

11:54.040 --> 11:55.473
- I don't believe you.
- Why not?

11:55.560 --> 11:59.712
Cos you're a bad liar. Miles just gave me
a bunch of busy work to do to keep me out.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.553
Do you think
there might be a reason he kept you out?

12:02.640 --> 12:05.200
He thinks I helped Audrey
break her surveillance.

12:05.280 --> 12:09.068
- Is that what it was about?
- I've already said too much.

12:09.160 --> 12:13.392
Come on, Shari. You owe me.
I stuck my neck out for you with Miles.

12:13.480 --> 12:15.914
Tell me what happened in there.

12:17.280 --> 12:20.636
Miles found Audrey.
He activated a transponder on her car.

12:20.720 --> 12:25.111
- So they know where she is?
- We're running an operational support now.

12:25.200 --> 12:28.636
That's what the briefing was about.
They sent a tac team ten minutes ago.

12:28.720 --> 12:31.792
Please don't tell anyone I said anything.

12:33.520 --> 12:36.239
Here she comes.

12:48.800 --> 12:52.634
Damn, she's good.
She set up a proprietary comm channel.

12:52.720 --> 12:55.234
- How long will it take to trace her call?
- Not long.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.993
Pick up.

13:02.160 --> 13:06.472
Somewhere in the valley.
Looks like a earphone.

13:06.560 --> 13:09.313
I've got the receiving end
at a one-mile radius.

13:09.400 --> 13:11.470
Why isn't Audrey picking up?

13:11.560 --> 13:13.949
Narrowing. Got it!

13:14.040 --> 13:16.952
- Where?
- Van Nuys airport.

13:17.040 --> 13:21.716
The emergency runway.
Adjacent to the main field.

13:21.800 --> 13:26.555
Move the tac team out now. Van Nuys airport.
Miles is forwarding the coordinates.

13:26.640 --> 13:28.995
- Operations.
- Get me the president.

13:45.640 --> 13:48.791
You said they sent the tac team
ten minutes ago.

13:51.320 --> 13:54.630
- Miles set me up, and you helped.
- You're working against us.

13:54.720 --> 13:56.950
- You've no idea what you've done.
- Milles told...

13:57.040 --> 14:01.591
Miles is an idiot. You should know that.
I can't believe you went along with him.

14:01.680 --> 14:04.069
- Please come with us.
- Where we going?

14:04.160 --> 14:06.151
Let's go.

14:08.280 --> 14:13.149
We still don't have confirmation that
Audrey Raines and Bauer are at the location.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.471
!Ne'll find out.
I'll have the military authority follow up on it.

14:16.560 --> 14:19.836
The military?
Sir, I just dispatched my tac team.

14:19.920 --> 14:21.956
- Call them back.
- I don't understand.

14:22.040 --> 14:26.079
Jack Bauer is a very sensitive problem.
There are political ramifications.

14:26.160 --> 14:29.038
I've decided to handle him directly.

14:29.120 --> 14:33.398
Besides, you must have your hands full
transitioning CTU to Homeland Security.

14:34.800 --> 14:37.951
- I'll recall my team, sir.
- Good.

14:39.440 --> 14:42.159
The president wants oversight
on the Bauer operation.

14:42.240 --> 14:46.472
He's the president. He can do what he wants.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.518
Yeah.

14:49.600 --> 14:52.160
- CTU thinks they've found Bauer.
- Where?

15:00.400 --> 15:03.551
Jack, what if my father's right?

15:03.640 --> 15:06.996
What if he can get Logan
to step down quietly?

15:07.080 --> 15:10.390
These people
bickered chemical weapons to terrorists.

15:10.480 --> 15:14.712
They've killed an ex-president of the United
States. Logan's not donna make a deal.

15:14.800 --> 15:17.792
If he did, he wouldn't keep it.
Henderson wouldn't let him.

15:17.880 --> 15:20.394
Your father is making himself a target.

15:20.480 --> 15:26.350
You hanna help him, help me get the
recording back before he speaks to Logan.

15:26.440 --> 15:31.912
Look, Mike, if the president wants Jack Bauer,
why doesn't he let us take care of it?

15:32.000 --> 15:35.197
I've been on other things.
Let me find out what's going on.

15:35.280 --> 15:37.475
- I'll get back to you.
- Thank you, Mike.

15:39.360 --> 15:41.828
..will be lifted within the next two hours.

15:41.920 --> 15:45.071
But the curfew will remain in eject...

15:50.520 --> 15:52.795
Come in.

15:52.880 --> 15:55.997
Oh, Mike.
That's only six hours from now.

15:56.080 --> 15:58.913
OK. Right.

15:59.000 --> 16:01.560
David Palmer's body's
being flown back to DC at 7 am.

16:01.640 --> 16:04.473
The president will be there
when the coffin's put on the plane.

16:04.560 --> 16:07.279
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

16:07.360 --> 16:13.196
- What's up, Mike?
- I just got a call from Karen Hayes at CTU.

16:13.280 --> 16:18.752
Do you know about the president's decision
to pull them off the acquisition of Bauer?

16:18.840 --> 16:22.879
- No. But what's the problem?
- It doesn't really make any sense.

16:22.960 --> 16:26.589
Karen's teams are closer,
they can do it more efficiently.

16:26.680 --> 16:32.676
Bauer's more likely to cooperate with them
than with a group of military police.

16:33.200 --> 16:35.794
Karen has barely got CTU back on its feet.

16:35.880 --> 16:41.000
I'm sure the president just feels more
confident with the military units in place.

16:41.080 --> 16:46.996
- Well, the military has its hands full, Hal.
- What do you want me to say, Mike?

16:47.080 --> 16:51.596
It's the president's call.
I can see it both ways.

16:54.600 --> 16:56.397
Thanks.

16:56.480 --> 16:57.913
Yeah.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.913
- DOD Operations.
- Put me through to General Warren, please.

17:10.000 --> 17:11.877
Yes, sir.

17:22.079 --> 17:25.675
- This is Warren.
- Mike Novick on the line for you.

17:25.760 --> 17:29.514
- Go ahead, Beth.
- Youke connected.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.589
What is it, Mike?

17:30.680 --> 17:34.832
General, can you give me an update
on your search for Jack Bauer?

17:34.920 --> 17:37.593
- What?
- The one the president ordered.

17:37.680 --> 17:41.036
We never received
such a call from the president.

17:41.120 --> 17:43.839
I see. I'm sorry to disturb you, General.

17:43.920 --> 17:45.911
Yes, sir.

18:02.000 --> 18:07.791
- You should try to get some rest.
- Yes, I know. I should try to get some rest.

18:13.120 --> 18:15.634
What is it you want, Mike?

18:15.720 --> 18:20.589
I just got off the phone with General Warren
who's running military operations here.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.113
Why?

18:22.200 --> 18:26.637
Karen Hayes over at Homeland raised
a few good points I thought I'd follow up on.

18:26.720 --> 18:29.109
What good points, Mike?

18:29.200 --> 18:33.079
She doesn't understand why
she was taken out of this Bauer situation.

18:33.160 --> 18:36.789
I really don't care
what Karen Hayes understands.

18:36.880 --> 18:42.000
She should be doing her job and not
asking questions that diminish my authority.

18:43.760 --> 18:46.593
Be that as it may, I did follow up, and, uh...

18:46.680 --> 18:51.390
now, frankly,
I'm a little mystified by some things.

18:51.480 --> 18:53.994
What things mystify you, Mike?

18:54.080 --> 18:58.631
Well, you told Homeland that you wanted
the military to pick up Jack Bauer,

18:58.720 --> 19:03.794
but I just spoke with General Warren
and he's unaware of any such directive.

19:03.880 --> 19:07.190
Because I didn't go through General Warren.

19:07.280 --> 19:10.670
May I ask who you did go through?

19:10.760 --> 19:13.513
Mike, let's get one thing straight.

19:13.600 --> 19:16.068
I don't answer to you.

19:16.160 --> 19:18.549
Of course not, sir.

19:22.320 --> 19:27.553
However, I will tell you this. I have decided to
use a covert task force to bring in Jack Bauer.

19:27.640 --> 19:33.078
The reason I am doing that is because
Bauer presents special circumstances.

19:33.160 --> 19:38.632
- "Special circumstances"?
- I want this completely off the radar, Mike.

19:40.120 --> 19:42.714
The Chinese government
believe Bauer is dead.

19:42.800 --> 19:47.271
If they find out he's alive, they're
going to blame us, they're going to accuse us

19:47.360 --> 19:50.909
of fabricating the story of his death.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.152
Wouldn't we be keeping the circle smaller
if we let Karen handle this?

19:55.240 --> 20:01.588
Her people already know about Bauer.
They're working under a secretive mandate.

20:01.680 --> 20:05.389
You know what, Mike?
I am tired of being second-guessed.

20:05.480 --> 20:09.758
I've been dealing with wall-to-wall crises
for the last 18 hours,

20:09.840 --> 20:13.071
and I think I've done a damn good job
of leading the country.

20:13.160 --> 20:15.720
Of course, Mr President.

20:17.960 --> 20:21.032
You came in here
suggesting that I should get some rest.

20:21.120 --> 20:26.399
That's the one recommendation of yours
that I intend to take.

20:27.480 --> 20:30.233
Thank you, Mike.

21:00.920 --> 21:04.071
We traced your call
to a public phone at Van Nuys airport.

21:04.160 --> 21:07.197
If Audrey is at that location,
you're in a lot of trouble.

21:07.280 --> 21:11.193
This situation is complicated.
You have no idea what you're dealing with.

21:11.280 --> 21:12.793
- But you do?
- Yes.

21:12.880 --> 21:16.759
- Then why didn't you tell me?
- Because I can't.

21:18.440 --> 21:22.479
You think the rules don't apply to you
because you're smarter than the rest of us.

21:22.560 --> 21:26.155
They do. And you're not.

21:26.240 --> 21:29.118
I won't miss you when you're gone.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.549
Miles.

21:33.440 --> 21:35.670
Don't touch me.

21:37.080 --> 21:40.914
- What?
- Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.913
He's a federal fugitive wanted
for the murder of a former president.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.639
Which means you're going to jail, O'Brian.

21:47.720 --> 21:50.314
For a long time.

21:52.400 --> 21:56.712
Miles. I don't think you're as big of a jerk
as you pretend to be.

21:58.480 --> 22:01.040
- I need to speak with you.
- Yes, sir.

22:09.440 --> 22:12.238
Has anyone
spoken to her in Holding?

22:12.320 --> 22:15.073
- No, sir.
- Has anyone tried to speak to her?

22:15.160 --> 22:17.993
- No, sir.
- O'Brian has been disloyal to CTU.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.834
She has been working with Bauer,
and I don't think I need to remind you,

22:21.920 --> 22:25.390
Karen Hayes and I regard her as a top priority.

22:35.480 --> 22:39.598
What are you doing, Chloe?
You're supposed to be in custody.

22:39.680 --> 22:43.355
- Miles let me out.
- You're a worse liar than I am.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.796
Shari, don't do that.

22:45.880 --> 22:50.317
- You helped Audrey break surveillance.
- For a good reason. I can't get into it now.

22:50.400 --> 22:54.188
I don't really think you have a choice.

22:54.280 --> 22:58.114
Listen to me for a minute.
Jack Bauer did not kill President Palmer.

22:58.200 --> 23:02.113
He knows who did it. He may need my help
to prove it, and I can't if I'm in custody.

23:02.200 --> 23:09.470
- Then why don't you just tell Karen?
- She won't believe me. Not without evidence.

23:10.520 --> 23:14.513
- It's President Logan.
- What are you talking about?

23:14.600 --> 23:19.549
The evidence Jack is trying to get implicates
Logan in the assassination of Palmer.

23:19.640 --> 23:21.119
That's ridiculous.

23:21.200 --> 23:25.239
You know your sexual harassment charges
against Miles? I know you were lying.

23:25.320 --> 23:31.350
You need help. If you try to stop me, I will
recommend you for psychiatric evaluation.

23:31.440 --> 23:34.079
You won't like that, trust me.

23:48.880 --> 23:50.598
Charles.

23:50.680 --> 23:53.274
Are you coming to bed soon?

23:55.040 --> 23:58.237
- I doubt if I'll get much sleep tonight.
- You should try.

23:58.320 --> 24:00.072
Yeah.

24:00.160 --> 24:03.391
- You OK?
- I'm fine. It's just, uh...

24:04.720 --> 24:07.188
It's been a challenging day.

24:10.280 --> 24:12.919
- Come to bed.
- I wlill.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.115
Soon.

24:19.200 --> 24:21.475
- Yes.
- Sorry to disturb you.

24:21.560 --> 24:24.313
Secretary Heller insists on talking to you.

24:24.400 --> 24:30.270
- Tell him I'll call him back tomorrow.
- He says ft's urgent, sir.

24:30.360 --> 24:32.396
Put him through.

24:34.400 --> 24:37.073
- Yes, James?
- Thanks for taking my call.

24:37.160 --> 24:40.311
- You said it was urgent.
- I need to see you, sir.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.631
- See me about what?
- I'd rather speak to you in person.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.678
Fine. But I won't be back to Washington
for a couple of days.

24:46.760 --> 24:50.435
- I'm in LA, sir. I need to see you tonight.
- Tonight?

24:50.520 --> 24:52.192
- Yes, sir.
- What is this about?

24:52.280 --> 24:54.840
I'll be there shortly
and we can discuss it then.

24:54.920 --> 24:59.630
I don't like your tone, James. You're
addressing the President of the United States.

24:59.720 --> 25:05.590
I know who I'm addressing. And I think
you know exactly what this is about.

25:05.680 --> 25:08.035
- When will you be here?
- Five minutes.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.554
Fine.

25:10.640 --> 25:13.029
James Heller? What does he want?

25:15.280 --> 25:19.831
He's getting flak from the joint chiefs
about my decision to maintain martial law.

25:19.920 --> 25:24.277
You would think that these people
would show some allegiance.

25:24.360 --> 25:28.558
- Can't James handle it himself?
- Apparently not.

25:31.720 --> 25:35.235
- Come to bed when you're done.
- I wiill.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.759
Yeah.

25:54.840 --> 25:57.070
- Where are you?
- We're leaving now.

25:57.160 --> 25:59.196
- How long will it take?
- Ten minutes.

25:59.280 --> 26:03.398
We may not have that much time.
James Heller is on his way here to see me.

26:03.480 --> 26:06.597
- Jack got to him.
- What if Bauer's given him the recording?

26:06.680 --> 26:11.834
Heller's not stupid enough to carry it with
him. Without it, what he knows won't matter.

26:11.920 --> 26:13.990
- Think Bauer still has it?
- I'm sure of it.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.835
I'll hold Heller off as long as I can. Phone me
the second you have the evidence in hand.

26:18.920 --> 26:20.069
Right.

27:13.600 --> 27:15.875
Mrs Logan.

27:25.680 --> 27:28.433
- What is Secretary Heller doing here?
- I don't know.

27:28.520 --> 27:30.988
But you have an idea.

27:32.200 --> 27:35.158
My husband says it's about
his order to maintain martial law,

27:35.240 --> 27:38.232
but I think it's something else.

27:39.760 --> 27:43.070
If you know what it is,
would you please tell me?

27:43.160 --> 27:46.277
- I can't
- You can't?

27:46.360 --> 27:49.352
Or you won't?

27:49.440 --> 27:53.069
Please don't ask me
anything more, Mrs Logan.

27:57.280 --> 27:59.953
Whatever you tell me
will remain between us,

28:00.040 --> 28:03.316
I promise you.

28:04.000 --> 28:06.468
Aaron,

28:06.560 --> 28:10.314
you can trust me, you know that.

28:14.040 --> 28:16.952
Not here.

28:17.040 --> 28:20.157
- Just meet me in a couple of minutes.
- Where?

28:20.240 --> 28:23.755
Outside the south stable.

28:33.120 --> 28:35.588
James.

28:35.680 --> 28:37.989
Thank you, gentlemen.

28:47.360 --> 28:51.433
- I hope this was important.
- I know what you did and what you're doing.

28:51.520 --> 28:54.193
And I'm here to put an end to it.

28:54.280 --> 29:00.276
- You'll have to be a little more specific.
- You are responsible for Palmer's murder.

29:02.320 --> 29:04.959
- That's outrageous.
- I heard a recording.

29:05.040 --> 29:09.431
A conversation between you
and a man named Christopher Henderson.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.433
When Palmer found out about your
insane plan, Henderson had him killed.

29:13.520 --> 29:16.478
And you let it happen.

29:16.560 --> 29:18.710
- Where is this recording?
- In a safe place.

29:18.800 --> 29:22.509
- I would like to hear it.
- Why? You know exactly what you said.

29:22.600 --> 29:25.114
And so do 1.

29:25.200 --> 29:28.431
It's burnt into my memory.

29:30.480 --> 29:33.392
How dare you stand there and judge me.

29:33.480 --> 29:35.914
You have no idea.

29:36.000 --> 29:40.118
Until you sit in my chair, you don't know
what the hell you're talking about.

29:40.200 --> 29:44.273
- Your chair is not a throne.
- I'm protecting the interests of our country.

29:44.360 --> 29:46.555
- You mean oil.
- Yes. Yes!

29:46.640 --> 29:51.395
This country needs energy, more than you or
anybody in this government cares to admit.

29:51.480 --> 29:55.268
We'll see how you judge me when
the cost of oil goes up over $100 a barrel,

29:55.360 --> 29:59.433
and the people who put me in office
can't heat their homes, or run their cars.

29:59.520 --> 30:03.195
And you think that justifies
the blood on your hands?

30:16.800 --> 30:22.796
- What do you want?
- Drop the trumped-up charges against Bauer.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.314
And leave my daughter alone.

30:26.920 --> 30:32.040
- Anything else?
- Announce your resignation by morning.

30:32.120 --> 30:37.240
Blame it on the crushing stress of today's
events. Blame it on whatever you want.

30:37.320 --> 30:42.110
Just as long as you go public
by the start of the morning news cycle.

30:42.200 --> 30:46.193
- And then what?
- The recording will be kept safe.

30:46.280 --> 30:48.794
This will remain between us.

30:51.160 --> 30:57.349
Call in Gardner. I want to be here
when you hand him your letter of resignation.

31:25.960 --> 31:28.155
Get in here.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.919
- I couldn't contact Jack or Audrey.
- I haven't either.

31:32.000 --> 31:35.037
CTU might have them in custody.
Where's your work station?

31:35.120 --> 31:38.271
This way.
Homeland changed my access code.

31:38.360 --> 31:40.920
I can create a workaround.

31:42.600 --> 31:45.114
If CTU has Jack, it's all my fault.

32:34.480 --> 32:37.517
I can get us gutta here.

32:43.360 --> 32:45.555
Watch the door.

33:40.160 --> 33:42.116
Jack.

33:45.720 --> 33:48.598
He's got restraints in his pockets. Secure him.

34:08.120 --> 34:10.509
Wachsler, status report.

34:11.600 --> 34:13.909
Mark, come in.

34:19.239 --> 34:21.754
Don't move! Don't... move.

34:21.840 --> 34:25.594
Slowly - put the gun on the ground
and kick it towards me.

34:25.679 --> 34:27.670
t) it!

34:31.320 --> 34:34.118
Put your hands where I can see 'em.

34:38.840 --> 34:42.628
Give me the recording. Slowly.

34:47.239 --> 34:49.310
Stand up.

34:49.400 --> 34:52.870
- What did you do to my partner?
- He's fine.

34:53.760 --> 34:57.878
Son of a bitch.
Take cover behind the wheel, now. Move!

35:08.520 --> 35:10.988
- What's going on?
- They want the recording.

35:11.080 --> 35:15.995
If you and I are donna get through this alive,
we need to work together.

35:18.200 --> 35:20.191
Gimme my gun.

35:25.640 --> 35:27.756
Go!

35:45.440 --> 35:47.192
Go! Move in!

35:48.840 --> 35:50.398
Take cover!

35:51.880 --> 35:53.711
Aagh!

36:15.600 --> 36:17.238
Audrey!

36:18.040 --> 36:21.794
I have her, Jack. And don't make me kill her.

36:21.880 --> 36:26.271
There's been too much killing today already,
so just throw out that recording.

36:26.360 --> 36:30.797
- Let her go, Christopher.
- After I have the recording.

36:30.880 --> 36:33.348
Why are you protecting Logan?

36:33.440 --> 36:36.796
I'm protecting something
more important than Logan.

36:36.880 --> 36:39.713
- What?
- The integrity of our government.

36:39.800 --> 36:41.916
Our government has no integrity.

36:42.000 --> 36:47.358
Not when someone like Charles Logan
occupies the presidency.

36:47.440 --> 36:50.079
You can make this right.
You can help me stop him.

36:50.160 --> 36:53.835
Sorry, Jack. Now, throw me the recording.

36:56.840 --> 37:00.150
I'll give you the recording
if you let Audrey go.

37:00.240 --> 37:04.233
- I wish I could believe that.
- I give you my word.

37:07.880 --> 37:11.714
I'll tell you what -
I'll meet you halfway.

37:11.800 --> 37:14.712
What does that mean?

37:14.800 --> 37:17.598
- Get out.
- Aud rev.

37:21.800 --> 37:24.598
- Dammit, Christopher!
- Here she comes, Jack.

37:24.680 --> 37:27.831
Just walk out slowly or I'll kill you.

37:29.400 --> 37:31.595
Audrey.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.960
- That's far enough.
- What have you done?

37:45.040 --> 37:47.156
The left brachial artery.

37:47.240 --> 37:52.917
She has about three minutes before she
bleeds to death. Throw me that recording.

37:53.000 --> 37:55.036
Jack, don't...

37:55.680 --> 37:59.673
She's 15 seconds closer to dying, Jack.
Gimme the recording!

37:59.760 --> 38:02.399
Jack, don't do it.

38:02.480 --> 38:05.313
She's running out of time!

38:06.400 --> 38:07.992
Jack...

38:08.080 --> 38:12.949
- Don't do it, Jack. Don't. Don't give it to him.
- Here it is!

38:28.960 --> 38:30.871
Easy. Easy. Easy.

38:30.960 --> 38:33.155
Easy. Stay with me. Stay with me.

38:33.240 --> 38:36.869
- Jack, go get it. Go get the recording.
- Stay with me.

38:38.360 --> 38:41.079
I'll be right back.

38:50.080 --> 38:52.275
Gimme your arm.

39:05.360 --> 39:07.590
I need to move you.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.238
Come on.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.869
All it needs is your signature, Mr President.

39:14.960 --> 39:17.918
James, we can find another way
to handle this.

39:18.000 --> 39:20.594
There must be something that you want.

39:20.680 --> 39:23.752
You're giving me exactly what I want.

39:25.320 --> 39:28.118
You asked to see me, Mr President?

39:28.200 --> 39:31.954
Hi, Jim. Thought you'd be
on a plane back to Washington.

39:32.040 --> 39:37.353
- What are you doing here?
- I'll let President Logan tell you.

39:39.720 --> 39:41.915
Mr President.

39:48.200 --> 39:50.589
it ?'I, 1...

39:54.640 --> 39:57.598
- Yes?
- I have the recording.

39:57.680 --> 40:01.798
- Really?
- I'll call you back after I've secured a vehicle.

40:01.880 --> 40:03.871
Thank you.

40:10.960 --> 40:16.193
Hal, I'm asking Secretary Heller to tender his
resignation. I wanted you here as a witness.

40:16.280 --> 40:20.353
- What?
- He thinks I was compliant in today's attacks.

40:20.440 --> 40:22.908
I don't know how he can accuse me
without evidence.

40:23.000 --> 40:28.438
He orchestrated a conspiracy
to let terrorists acquire stolen nerve gas.

40:28.520 --> 40:30.397
That's insane.

40:30.480 --> 40:36.191
He sanctioned the assassination
of David Palmer, and I have the evidence.

40:36.280 --> 40:38.714
Where? Show it to us.

40:45.760 --> 40:49.150
Who was on the phone? Who made that call?

40:51.200 --> 40:53.475
I want your resignation by the morning.

40:53.560 --> 40:57.678
- If any harm comes to my daughter...
- Gentlemen!

40:57.760 --> 41:02.151
Please escort Secretary Heller
out of my home.

41:23.800 --> 41:25.995
This is donna hurt.
