Aw, this sucks.

00:50.600 --> 00:52.436

All of it!

01:45.355 --> 01:47.491
I have milked
all the goats.

01:47.524 --> 01:49.526

that's the goat and baby

it's the right year.

Welcome to this

still in the car.

really here?

liberal Jewish dissident,

05:32.081 --> 05:34.217

Frank Maxwell.

could run forever?

you've got the wrong mouse.

Frank Maxwell,

05:46.930 --> 05:49.065

05:52.802 --> 05:54.771
Whoa! You killed him?

05:54.804 --> 05:56.172

something called "commentary."

06:09.986 --> 06:13.022
The commentary here
is that Mickey Mouse hates Jews.

06:13.056 --> 06:16.893
Now, let's see what else this
new nanny has up her sleeve.

06:20.830 --> 06:24.233
Okay, Stewie, this is favorite

07:16.285 --> 07:18.988
Eh, it could be fun.
And we haven't been on a date

07:19.022 --> 07:20.356

07:50.153 --> 07:52.021
I do not.

07:52.055 --> 07:53.690
Oh, this is nice.

07:53.723 --> 07:55.358
So, how's work?

07:55.391 --> 07:56.860
Good.

07:58.562 --> 08:00.029
How, uh...

08:00.063 --> 08:02.298
how's the stuff you do
during your day?

08:02.331 --> 08:04.000
Good.
Good.

08:05.234 --> 08:06.870
So... is that it?

08:06.903 --> 08:09.539
Did we do a date?
Phones back on?

08:09.573 --> 08:11.841
Peter, we finally have
a chance to reconnect.

08:11.875 --> 08:13.409
We've been given
this opportunity.

08:13.442 --> 08:15.011
It's like before
we had kids.

08:15.044 --> 08:16.913
We got to make
the most of it.

08:16.946 --> 08:18.247
H-Hang on, hang on, Lois.

08:18.281 --> 08:20.650
Give me two of those round balls
of butter and a breadstick.

08:20.684 --> 08:22.085
You'll see where
I'm heading with this.

08:22.118 --> 08:25.221
Okay, look, look, look.
Here's what you want.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.223
Here's what you got.
(chuckles)

08:27.256 --> 08:29.392
I'm very happy
with what I got.

08:29.425 --> 08:33.029
Hmm. Well, maybe I can give you
half a breadstick later.

08:33.062 --> 08:36.499
As long as you don't mind a
little marinara dipping sauce.

08:36.532 --> 08:38.501
That's absolutely disgusting.

08:38.534 --> 08:40.069
And I love it.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.572
You know what?
I like date night.

08:42.606 --> 08:44.741
To Natalia,
for making it possible.

08:45.875 --> 08:47.877
Pretty sure
that's Steve's pee.

08:47.911 --> 08:50.313
Enjoying your wine?

08:55.151 --> 08:57.120
Oh, what an amazing night.

08:57.153 --> 09:00.423
I told you we could have
a fun time, just the two of us.

09:00.456 --> 09:02.425
Fun's not over yet.

09:02.458 --> 09:03.559
(moaning)

09:03.593 --> 09:05.629
PETER:
Come on, let's get in the trunk.

09:05.662 --> 09:08.598
I filled it with water
so we can do it hippo-style.

09:08.632 --> 09:09.933
Weightlessly,

09:09.966 --> 09:12.602
with my feet lightly scraping
the bottom as we do it.

09:12.636 --> 09:14.904
LOIS: Okay.
It's kind of sexy, I guess.

09:14.938 --> 09:16.773
PETER:
And in the hippo tradition,

09:16.806 --> 09:19.108
first we must eat
a whole head of lettuce.

09:19.142 --> 09:22.979
Now, do you have the lettuce?
I-I didn't know
we were doing this.

09:23.012 --> 09:24.614
Did you bring the lettuce?

09:24.648 --> 09:25.949
Oh, no, I forgot.

09:25.982 --> 09:28.117
Ronald, I asked you
to do one thing.

09:28.151 --> 09:30.654
Honey, honey...
I brought the lettuce.

09:35.859 --> 09:37.260
So thanks to Natalia,

09:37.293 --> 09:39.462
we've been spending
so much more time together.

09:39.495 --> 09:41.931
Let me tell you, Joe,
it's really been a rediscovery.

09:41.965 --> 09:43.767
Hmm.
Joe, "we time"

09:43.800 --> 09:46.970
is just as important
as "me time."
Okay.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.238
We've actually been watching
The Middle together.

09:49.272 --> 09:51.908
It's so funny!
Isn't it funny, Peter?

09:51.941 --> 09:54.310
It is actually funny.
At least three times an episode

09:54.343 --> 09:56.312
we turn to each other
and we say,

09:56.345 --> 09:58.014
BOTH:
"That's just like us!"

09:58.047 --> 09:59.482
(laughing)
(laughs)

09:59.515 --> 10:00.850
Why are you
laughing?

10:00.884 --> 10:03.352
It sounded funny.
But you had to be there.

10:03.386 --> 10:05.689
Well, I was able to
imagine myself there,

10:05.722 --> 10:07.423
which is why
I chuckled.

10:07.456 --> 10:09.759
Oh, and, Donna,
have you seen this Black-ish?

10:09.793 --> 10:11.828
Why are you
asking me that?
I don't know.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.930
It seems like
you might like it.

10:13.963 --> 10:16.833
Oh, and, waiter, have you seen
this Fresh Off the Boat?

10:16.866 --> 10:19.135
Why are you
asking me that?
I don't know.

10:19.168 --> 10:20.837
It seems like
you might like it.

10:20.870 --> 10:22.038
Oh, there's Mort. Mort!

10:22.071 --> 10:24.507
Have you seen
this The Goldbergs?

10:24.540 --> 10:27.210
MORT: Yes! I like it
'cause I'm Jewish.

10:30.079 --> 10:34.017
Boy, our friends all seem
to be happily married.

10:34.050 --> 10:35.985
(both laugh)
Yeah, right.

10:36.019 --> 10:37.653
You know, Donna told me
in the bathroom

10:37.687 --> 10:39.355
she and Cleveland
haven't had sex

10:39.388 --> 10:40.523
in over three months.

10:40.556 --> 10:41.725
I love that you
share things

10:41.758 --> 10:43.459
that were told to you
in confidence.

10:43.492 --> 10:45.962
Oh, and the poor
Swansons.
I know.

10:45.995 --> 10:47.463
Joe's dead
from the waist down,

10:47.496 --> 10:49.032
and Bonnie's dead
from the waist up.

10:49.065 --> 10:50.399
They're perfect
for each other.

10:50.433 --> 10:52.902
(both laughing)
I know, I know.

10:52.936 --> 10:54.871
I got to say, Peter,
I really feel like

10:54.904 --> 10:56.706
Natalia has helped
put the spark back

10:56.740 --> 10:58.174
in our relationship.

10:58.207 --> 11:00.910
Yeah, we even had
independent movie sex.

11:00.944 --> 11:04.647
I want to lean over this
half-eaten blueberry pie

11:04.680 --> 11:06.883
and kiss you with
black coffee breath.

11:06.916 --> 11:09.185
Is that okay?
Yes.

11:12.088 --> 11:14.490
Now, can I do you
to a song you know,

11:14.523 --> 11:15.925
but sung in German?

11:17.927 --> 11:20.696
(to the tune of
"Walking on Sunshine")

11:33.743 --> 11:35.178
What is it?

11:35.211 --> 11:37.280
I've been assassinated.

11:46.289 --> 11:48.224
Wow, what a night.

11:48.257 --> 11:51.527
I guess someone's
sleep number is 69.

11:51.560 --> 11:54.931
Uh, yes. It was, apparently,
also number two.

11:54.964 --> 11:56.365
Would you maybe
make some coffee

11:56.399 --> 11:58.267
and give me a moment?

11:58.301 --> 12:00.536
Car is packed for weekend.

12:00.569 --> 12:01.871
Weekend?
Yes.

12:01.905 --> 12:03.539
You come in late
last night drunk

12:03.572 --> 12:06.075
and tell me to pack car
for weekend getaway

12:06.109 --> 12:07.376
you book online.

12:07.410 --> 12:10.379
Then you make me watch
Diff'rent Strokes episode

12:10.413 --> 12:14.750
with substitute teacher
played by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

12:14.784 --> 12:16.652
You know, I forgot about
this weekend trip.

12:16.685 --> 12:18.621
I-Is that something
we still want to do?

12:18.654 --> 12:20.156
Well, I do if you do.

12:20.189 --> 12:22.391
Absolutely I do-- I-I was
just seeing if you do.

12:22.425 --> 12:23.993
Of course I do.

12:24.027 --> 12:26.595
I mean, we've already had
six nights out together.

12:26.629 --> 12:28.431
It'd be great to
have three more.

12:28.464 --> 12:29.632
That's what I'm saying.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.167
That-That's what
any guy wants,

12:31.200 --> 12:33.937
the same gal again
and again and again

12:33.970 --> 12:36.305
and again and again
and again and again

12:36.339 --> 12:38.808
and again and again
and again and again

12:38.842 --> 12:40.743
and again and again,
and again.

12:40.776 --> 12:43.112
And every gal wants
the same guy who keeps

12:43.146 --> 12:45.781
getting fatter and fatter
and fatter and fatter...

12:45.815 --> 12:47.616
Stop it right there, Lois.
This is Family Guy.

12:47.650 --> 12:49.685
We only do the male side
of the joke.

12:51.054 --> 12:53.422
You know what? I think
this weekend will be fun.

12:53.456 --> 12:54.790
Yeah. I mean, it's
not like we're gonna

12:54.824 --> 12:56.325
miss anything
around here.

13:00.729 --> 13:02.265
Hey, Joe, what the hell's
going on here?

13:02.298 --> 13:04.467
Oh, you didn't hear?
Today is the opening

13:04.500 --> 13:07.636
of the first-ever
Spooner Street Farmers Market.

13:07.670 --> 13:10.306
(in slow motion):
Farmers...

13:10.339 --> 13:13.009
market?

13:13.042 --> 13:14.677
Yeah, it's
really exciting.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.812
For 50 cents, you can
get your picture taken

13:16.846 --> 13:18.514
wearing a farmer's hat.

13:18.547 --> 13:21.517
(in slow motion):
Farmer's...

13:21.550 --> 13:23.887
hat?

13:23.920 --> 13:25.855
Hey, have a great
weekend, you two.

13:25.889 --> 13:29.225
So glad you're finding
time for each other.

13:32.929 --> 13:34.197
Goat meat.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.865
Get your goat meat here.

13:35.899 --> 13:37.366
Cleveland, are those...
Yep.

13:37.400 --> 13:39.202
I have dibs on
whatever silliness

13:39.235 --> 13:40.904
Peter loses interest in.

13:40.937 --> 13:42.071
Remember this?

13:42.105 --> 13:44.240
To the Cleveland copter!

13:46.209 --> 13:48.311
The moustache obscures my view!

13:48.344 --> 13:49.412
(cries out)

13:58.787 --> 14:00.189
LOIS:
Oh, another hawk.

14:00.223 --> 14:01.557
Or maybe it's the same one.

14:01.590 --> 14:03.059
You think it could be
the same one?

14:03.092 --> 14:04.928
Doubt it.

14:04.961 --> 14:06.229
Hey, do you have
the address?

14:06.262 --> 14:08.064
I think it's in
my pocketbook somewhere.

14:08.097 --> 14:10.599
'Cause I got to know if
we should take 24 or 495.

14:10.633 --> 14:13.069
Hang on.

14:13.102 --> 14:15.771
Anything?
Hang on.

14:15.804 --> 14:18.607
Exit's coming up.

14:18.641 --> 14:20.376
Half a mile.

14:22.745 --> 14:24.113
Quarter mile.
(laughs)

14:24.147 --> 14:25.414
You'd think
I could find it.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.782
(chuckles):
Yeah, yeah, I would.

14:26.815 --> 14:29.552
I would. Okay,
I'm taking 495.

14:29.585 --> 14:31.687
Okay, uh, here,
let me see if it's...

14:31.720 --> 14:34.757
Oh, this is why I don't
like big purses.

14:34.790 --> 14:38.227
Here it is.
It says take 24 to 128.

14:38.261 --> 14:40.063
(inhales deeply)

14:40.096 --> 14:42.098
(exhales slowly)

14:49.973 --> 14:51.840
(windshield squeaking)

14:53.576 --> 14:55.578
(crickets chirping)

14:58.814 --> 15:00.149
Hey, look, cookies.

15:00.183 --> 15:01.951
Chocolate chip?
Oatmeal raisin.

15:01.985 --> 15:03.586
(bleep)

15:03.619 --> 15:06.990
Ah, I guess they stopped
serving dinner at 9:30.

15:07.023 --> 15:09.592
Looks like that missed exit
had the last laugh.

15:09.625 --> 15:10.893
Oh, look at
this cute note.

15:10.926 --> 15:12.128
"In lieu of television,

15:12.161 --> 15:14.230
please tune in
to each other."

15:14.263 --> 15:15.231
Ha-ha.

15:15.264 --> 15:17.500
Ha-ha, indeed.
And get this.

15:17.533 --> 15:19.635
"Sorry no Wi-Fi,
but the good news is

15:19.668 --> 15:21.437
your marriage has
four bars."

15:21.470 --> 15:22.505
Terrific.

15:22.538 --> 15:23.839
Oh, here's another note.

15:23.872 --> 15:26.009
"How adorable were
those first two notes?

15:26.042 --> 15:27.743
I hope you read
this one third."

15:27.776 --> 15:29.979
There's a used condom
in the fireplace.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.447
And the fireplace
is decorative,

15:31.480 --> 15:32.648
so that's here to stay.

15:32.681 --> 15:34.150
So, do you think
word just got out

15:34.183 --> 15:35.751
in the daddy longlegs
community, like,

15:35.784 --> 15:37.153
"Hey, come to this hotel"?

15:37.186 --> 15:38.621
Peter, it's a little
warm in here.

15:38.654 --> 15:40.956
Do you want to turn on
that overhead ceiling fan?

15:40.990 --> 15:42.125
Sure. Looks stable.

15:45.194 --> 15:46.996
Can you notice that?
Yeah.

15:47.030 --> 15:49.198
Can you notice anything
in the world other than that?

15:49.232 --> 15:52.468
Only that fist-sized moth
in the lampshade by the bed.

15:52.501 --> 15:55.538
I'm going to bed so that
"go home time" comes faster.

16:06.749 --> 16:08.817
I'll just sleep
with the light on.

16:14.023 --> 16:16.525
Natalia, will you be
our nanny forever?

16:16.559 --> 16:18.727
Dah, unless Belarus
security force

16:18.761 --> 16:20.863
track me down.
I'm sorry, what?

16:20.896 --> 16:22.698

a few enemies

16:22.731 --> 16:25.000

What?

18:42.471 --> 18:43.972
That mealy-mouth
thing you do.

18:44.006 --> 18:45.107
Take a sip of water.

18:45.140 --> 18:46.775
I don't like water.
I like pop.

18:46.809 --> 18:48.377
Hey, will you let me
know when you're done

18:48.411 --> 18:50.012
using the phone charger
that I brought?

18:50.045 --> 18:51.680
Oh, you mean the only
thing that you packed?

18:51.714 --> 18:53.349
Yeah, I just assumed
if you pay,

18:53.382 --> 18:55.017
you don't have to pack.
Here we go.

18:55.050 --> 18:56.352
My husband,
the Rockefeller,

18:56.385 --> 18:58.354
letting my parents
pay for the nanny.

18:58.387 --> 18:59.855
Kids still lining up
around the block

18:59.888 --> 19:01.156
for those piano lessons?

19:01.190 --> 19:02.691
I wonder which has
more clutter on it,

19:02.725 --> 19:03.992
the piano or your treadmill.

19:04.026 --> 19:05.394
You know what?
I'm gonna go with the treadmill.

19:05.428 --> 19:07.996
Really? Let's go knock
on the door of the next room

19:08.030 --> 19:09.832
and ask them
which one of us is fat.

19:09.865 --> 19:12.167
Oh, I'm so sorry I'm
not Bradley Hooper.

19:12.201 --> 19:13.469
It's Cooper, not Hooper.

19:13.502 --> 19:15.638
You're thinking of
Mr. Hooper from Sesame Street,

19:15.671 --> 19:16.972
and I'd sooner bang him.

19:17.005 --> 19:19.408
He was a business owner.
He was a successful man.

one in this relationship

19:21.344 --> 19:22.911
who wants to be with
a successful man?

19:22.945 --> 19:25.414
Get over yourself.
Oh, hey, do you want
these spit droplets back,

19:25.448 --> 19:26.715
or are they
for my arm to keep?

19:26.749 --> 19:29.017
Sorry, I was trying to
scare that fly on your hand.

19:29.051 --> 19:30.419
Oh, it's a liver spot.
Never mind.

19:30.453 --> 19:32.688
I'm hoping it's cancer.
I want the ticket out.

19:32.721 --> 19:34.923
Oh, if you die, can I have
all of your nothing?

19:34.957 --> 19:36.392
What do you mean
if I die?

19:36.425 --> 19:38.761
I've been dead since
the minute I said "I do"!

19:38.794 --> 19:40.229
Well, the minute
you say "I don't,"

19:40.263 --> 19:41.497
I am out that door.

19:41.530 --> 19:44.099
Oh, is that right?
Yep.

19:44.132 --> 19:46.402
Well, what if I just said,
"The hell with it, go"?

19:46.435 --> 19:47.436
What if you did?

19:48.871 --> 19:50.239
Go.
