00:00.177 --> 00:01.782
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:01.782 --> 00:03.576
I THOUGHT
THIS WASN'T GONNA HAPPEN.

00:03.576 --> 00:04.577
IT WON'T.

00:04.577 --> 00:06.046
SHE'S A PROBLEM, JACK.

00:06.046 --> 00:07.547
YOU HAVEN'T SEEN MY PHONE,
HAVE YOU?

00:07.547 --> 00:08.815
NOPE. SORRY.

00:08.815 --> 00:13.177
I don't know
what I did with it.

00:13.177 --> 00:14.387
JUST ANSWER ME.

00:14.387 --> 00:16.122
ARE YOU HAVING AN AFFAIR?

00:16.122 --> 00:18.425
NO.
THIS IS A TEST SHOT.

00:18.425 --> 00:21.060
CASE IS DISMISSED.

00:21.060 --> 00:22.562
NOW THAT IT'S OVER,
WE CAN GET BACK TO BUSINESS.

00:22.562 --> 00:23.730
I QUIT.

00:23.730 --> 00:26.032
THATCHER, I'M NOT WORKING
FOR YOU ANYMORE.

01:03.303 --> 01:08.107
I've never been
so happy.

01:15.682 --> 01:17.016
HEY.

01:17.016 --> 01:18.418
HEY.

01:18.418 --> 01:20.687
I'M EXHAUSTED.
I'M HEADING TO BED.

01:23.656 --> 01:25.825
DID YOU HEAR
ABOUT THE KARSTEN CASE?

01:25.825 --> 01:26.960
NO. WHAT?

01:26.960 --> 01:28.027
AH, FORGET IT.

01:28.027 --> 01:30.330
YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR ABOUT MY WORK.

01:30.330 --> 01:32.499
IT BORES YOU,
RIGHT?

01:32.499 --> 01:34.834
NO.
I NEVER SAID THAT.

01:34.834 --> 01:37.003
CASE WAS DISMISSED.

01:37.003 --> 01:38.538
NO EVIDENCE.

01:38.538 --> 01:41.541
REALLY?
WHAT HAPPENED?

01:41.541 --> 01:42.842
WHAT'S IT MATTER?

01:42.842 --> 01:46.279
IT'S ALL A WHITEWASH
BY THEIR LAWYER -- McALLISTER.

01:46.279 --> 01:48.214
WELL, I'M SORRY THAT --

01:48.214 --> 01:50.617
THIS McALLISTER
IS SUCH A LOWLIFE.

01:50.617 --> 01:53.520
ALL HE DOES
IS MOP UP AFTER KARSTEN'S MESS.

01:53.520 --> 01:55.922
HIS HANDS ARE SO DIRTY,
IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF TIME

01:55.922 --> 01:58.191
BEFORE HE ENDS UP BEHIND BARS,
A REAL SCUMBAG.

01:59.325 --> 02:04.631
WELL I'M TIRED,
DREW.

02:04.631 --> 02:06.332
I'M HEADING TO BED.

02:06.332 --> 02:07.534
OH, I'M SORRY.

02:07.534 --> 02:09.068
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO HEAR ABOUT THE CASE.

02:09.068 --> 02:11.638
I DID. I DO.

02:11.638 --> 02:13.673
I'M JUST EXHAUSTED.

02:20.313 --> 02:22.482
HEY,
YOU EVER FIND YOUR PHONE?

02:26.319 --> 02:28.288
NO,
I DIDN'T.

02:39.399 --> 02:42.435
YOU GOT
A BUNCH OF CALLS.

02:44.504 --> 02:47.106
WHO'S J.M.?

03:00.186 --> 03:02.455
I DIDN'T SAY
ANYTHING BEFORE,

03:02.455 --> 03:05.792
BUT HE'S INTERESTED
IN BUYING A PRINT.

03:05.792 --> 03:07.527
DON'T DO THAT.

03:07.527 --> 03:09.028
DON'T LIE TO ME.

03:09.028 --> 03:12.465
YOU'VE BEEN HAVING SEX
WITH HIM, RIGHT?

03:12.465 --> 03:14.801
RIGHT?

03:17.270 --> 03:19.639
GET OUT.

03:21.274 --> 03:22.976
COME ON --
OUT.

03:22.976 --> 03:23.977
PLEASE --

03:23.977 --> 03:25.144
GET OUT!

03:25.144 --> 03:27.080
DON'T TALK TO ME
LIKE THAT.

03:27.080 --> 03:28.114
MOMMY?

03:28.114 --> 03:30.149
DON'T LET HIM SEE THIS,
OKAY?

03:30.149 --> 03:31.217
MOMMY?

03:31.217 --> 03:32.352
HI, OLIVER.

03:32.352 --> 03:34.854
MOMMY AND DADDY
ARE JUST TALKING, OKAY?

03:34.854 --> 03:37.423
YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK
TO SLEEP, OKAY?

03:37.423 --> 03:38.658
GO BACK TO SLEEP.

03:38.658 --> 03:40.493
OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

03:42.328 --> 03:43.396
PLEASE.
IT'S NOT FAIR.

03:43.396 --> 03:44.797
IF I'M NOT HERE
IN THE MORNING,

03:44.797 --> 03:46.099
HE'S NOT
GONNA UNDERSTAND --

03:46.099 --> 03:47.567
YOU ARE NOT
SLEEPING HERE TONIGHT.

03:47.567 --> 03:48.901
IT'S NOT FAIR TO HIM.
PLEASE.

03:48.901 --> 03:50.503
DREW, WE CAN JUST TALK
ABOUT IT, OKAY?

03:50.503 --> 03:51.638
NO, WE CAN'T.

03:51.638 --> 03:54.073
PLEASE.
NOT NOW!

04:08.254 --> 04:11.257
-- Captions by VITAC --

04:37.617 --> 04:40.219
I'M SO SORRY.

04:44.724 --> 04:46.826
WHAT NOW?

04:46.826 --> 04:49.495
I DON'T KNOW.

04:49.495 --> 04:52.131
WHAT ARE WE DOING?

04:52.131 --> 04:54.667
IT'LL BE OKAY.

04:54.667 --> 04:57.637
YES. I'LL STAY
WITH YOU TONIGHT.

04:57.637 --> 04:59.138
YOU SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

05:00.440 --> 05:02.108
NO, I-I NEED
TO THINK.

05:02.108 --> 05:04.310
LET'S JUST --
LET'S TALK TOMORROW.

05:04.310 --> 05:05.812
OKAY.

05:25.698 --> 05:27.633
COME ON.

05:29.469 --> 05:30.970
HEY.
OH, HEY.

05:30.970 --> 05:32.004
SORRY.

05:32.004 --> 05:33.139
I'VE BEEN MEANING
TO SCRAPE THAT DOWN.

05:33.139 --> 05:34.607
WELL,
THAT'S OKAY.

05:34.607 --> 05:36.709
YOU'VE BEEN VERY BUSY KEEPING
MY LITTLE BROTHER OUT OF JAIL.

05:36.709 --> 05:38.478
WHY DIDN'T YOU COME
TO THE RESTAURANT?

05:38.478 --> 05:40.513
EVERYONE
WAS SO HAPPY.

05:40.513 --> 05:42.482
OH, I WAS TRYING TO FINISH
SOME STUFF AT THE OFFICE.

05:42.482 --> 05:43.649
WELL, IT'S OKAY,

05:43.649 --> 05:45.985
BECAUSE I BROUGHT CHAMPAGNE
FOR THE TWO OF US.

05:48.488 --> 05:49.989
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

05:49.989 --> 05:52.725
YOU'RE LIKE
8,000 MILES AWAY.

05:52.725 --> 05:55.461
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL YOU.

06:01.033 --> 06:04.070
WHAT, BABE?

06:09.442 --> 06:11.444
I-I QUIT
KARSTEN ALLIED.

06:11.444 --> 06:15.114
WHAT? WHEN?

06:15.114 --> 06:18.050
ON MY WAY OUT
OF THE COURTHOUSE TODAY.

06:18.050 --> 06:20.920
MY DAD DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING
TO ME.

06:20.920 --> 06:23.456
IT WAS
A LONG TIME COMING.

06:23.456 --> 06:25.491
I NEED
A NEW START.

06:25.491 --> 06:27.326
JACK.

06:27.326 --> 06:29.162
OH, JACK!

06:29.162 --> 06:30.329
FINALLY.

06:30.329 --> 06:34.100
OH, YOU KNOW HOW LONG
I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.935
YOU KNOW,
WE CAN HAVE A NORMAL LIFE NOW.

06:35.935 --> 06:37.303
WE'RE NOT TIED
TO MY FATHER.

06:37.303 --> 06:38.337
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS.

06:38.337 --> 06:39.939
YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE TO GO SOMEWHERE.

06:39.939 --> 06:42.909
WE SHOULD GO TO --
TO DOOR COUNTY, RIGHT?

06:42.909 --> 06:46.279
GET ONE OF THE CABINS UP THERE,
JUST YOU AND ME.

06:46.279 --> 06:48.314
BAILEYS HARBOR.
REMEMBER?

06:48.314 --> 06:50.483
WE LOVE THAT PLACE --
THE SUNSETS AND THE GREAT WINE

06:50.483 --> 06:52.084
AND THE LONG NAPS
IN THE HAMMOCK.

06:52.084 --> 06:54.687
I'M SO EXCITED.

06:55.922 --> 06:57.156
MM.
MWAH!

06:57.156 --> 06:58.958
CHEERS.

06:58.958 --> 07:02.261
TO FREEDOM.

07:19.679 --> 07:22.748
DADDY,
I HAD A BAD DREAM.

07:22.748 --> 07:25.084
IT'S OKAY,
BUDDY.

07:25.084 --> 07:26.452
COME HERE.

07:32.124 --> 07:34.160
WHERE'S MOMMY?

07:34.160 --> 07:35.962
DON'T WORRY.

07:35.962 --> 07:38.631
SHE'LL BE BACK SOON.

07:56.337 --> 07:59.841
I LET MYSELF IN.

07:59.841 --> 08:02.010
I JUST -- I DIDN'T WANT
TO WAKE HIM.

08:03.978 --> 08:05.513
HOW ARE YOU,
SWEETHEART?

08:05.513 --> 08:06.748
YOU'RE UP EARLY.

08:06.748 --> 08:09.484
TODAY'S SHOW-AND-TELL --
AUNT CHLOE'S TOY!

08:09.484 --> 08:10.685
OH, NO.

08:10.685 --> 08:12.186
I LEFT IT
IN MY ROOM.

08:12.186 --> 08:14.689
OKAY.

08:19.193 --> 08:21.462
CAN WE FIND SOME TIME
TO TALK?

08:21.462 --> 08:24.532
THERE'S NOTHING
TO TALK ABOUT.

08:28.336 --> 08:31.172
WELL, AMY'S GONNA FINISH
THE SCHOOL YEAR,

08:31.172 --> 08:33.741
AND THEN WE PLAN
TO MOVE TO ANN ARBOR.

08:33.741 --> 08:36.811
MY FRIEND HAS A WAITRESSING JOB
FOR ME THERE --

08:36.811 --> 08:37.845
A GREAT PLACE.

08:37.845 --> 08:40.214
DON'T DO THAT.
STAY.

08:40.214 --> 08:43.618
I-I'VE BEEN THINKING --
MAYBE IF --

08:43.618 --> 08:45.119
IF YOU DON'T LEAVE,

08:45.119 --> 08:48.856
THEN I COULD BRING SOME CLOTHES
OVER TO YOUR PLACE,

08:48.856 --> 08:53.094
AND I COULD LEAVE THEM THERE,
LIKE, ALL THE TIME, YOU KNOW?

08:53.094 --> 08:55.763
WE COULD --
WE COULD LIVE TOGETHER.

08:57.765 --> 09:00.435
YOU'RE A GOOD GUY.

09:00.435 --> 09:04.238
YOU'VE BEEN REAL NICE TO ME
AND AMY --

09:04.238 --> 09:05.606
A REAL FRIEND.

09:08.009 --> 09:09.677
DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

09:09.677 --> 09:12.847
I DO.

09:12.847 --> 09:15.416
T.J.,
I-I DO, BUT --

09:15.416 --> 09:16.517
WHAT?

09:16.517 --> 09:19.153
WELL,
THERE ARE MANY REASONS.

09:19.153 --> 09:21.923
THE BIGGEST ONE
IS YOUR FATHER.

09:21.923 --> 09:23.524
WELL,
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:23.524 --> 09:25.393
LISTEN,
T.J., I KNOW THIS --

09:25.393 --> 09:27.528
YOUR FATHER WILL DO
WHATEVER IT TAKES

09:27.528 --> 09:29.831
TO MAKE SURE
IT NEVER HAPPENS BETWEEN US.

09:32.066 --> 09:36.204
WE CAN'T GET
AROUND THAT.

09:55.556 --> 09:57.391
ARE --
ARE YOU -- DO YOU --

09:57.391 --> 09:59.927
DO YOU WANT TO TAKE HIM
TO SCHOOL TODAY?

09:59.927 --> 10:02.396
YOU READY,
BUD?

10:07.568 --> 10:09.537
WAVE TO MOMMY.

10:09.537 --> 10:11.405
BYE.
BYE.

10:30.424 --> 10:33.227
AH, YOU ARE A LITTLE EARLY,
DON'T YOU THINK?

10:33.227 --> 10:35.296
YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE
UNTIL 3:00.

10:35.296 --> 10:36.998
WELL,
I WAS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,

10:36.998 --> 10:38.299
AND I THOUGHT,

10:38.299 --> 10:40.134
"YOU KNOW, I SHOULD SHOW ELAINE
THIS NEW MALBEC."

10:40.134 --> 10:42.637
YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST COME
IN HERE WHENEVER YOU LIKE, HUH?

10:42.637 --> 10:45.106
IT'S FUN TO COME UP WITH EXCUSES
TO BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD

10:45.106 --> 10:48.109
SO THAT I CAN JUST DROP BY
AND SAY,

10:48.109 --> 10:51.312
"HEY, I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD."

10:52.313 --> 10:54.115
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"EXCUSES"?

10:54.115 --> 10:55.616
TO SEE YOU.

10:55.616 --> 10:59.954
LOOK, ELAINE,
AM I CRAZY?

10:59.954 --> 11:02.623
AM I IMAGINING THIS THING
BETWEEN US?

11:02.623 --> 11:04.058
THERE'S NO THING.

11:04.058 --> 11:05.793
YOU'RE MARRIED.
I KNOW.

11:05.793 --> 11:06.828
YES.

11:06.828 --> 11:09.130
NOW, THAT DOESN'T MEAN
I CAN'T BE ATTRACTED

11:09.130 --> 11:10.331
TO OTHER PEOPLE,
BUT --

11:10.331 --> 11:11.532
YOU'RE ATTRACTED
TO ME?

11:11.532 --> 11:13.201
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY
IS THAT I --

11:13.201 --> 11:14.435
ARE YOU ATTRACTED
TO ME?

11:14.435 --> 11:16.137
WE CAN'T HAVE THIS CONVERSATION.

11:16.137 --> 11:17.405
BECAUSE I-I AM ATTRACTED
TO YOU.

11:17.405 --> 11:19.473
STOP.

11:19.473 --> 11:22.443
STOP WHAT?

11:29.851 --> 11:31.319
I THINK

11:31.319 --> 11:33.588
I THINK MAYBE
YOU SHOULD START

11:33.588 --> 11:34.922
DOING YOUR DELIVERIES
IN THE EVENING,

11:34.922 --> 11:36.457
AND I'M GONNA HAVE
MY NIGHT MANAGER, MARCO,

11:36.457 --> 11:37.758
DO THE BUYING.

11:37.758 --> 11:40.127
WAIT, SERIOUSLY?
YOU MEAN THAT?

11:42.363 --> 11:43.731
OKAY.

11:43.731 --> 11:47.068
I TOTALLY HEAR YOU.

11:47.068 --> 11:49.103
YOU HAVE
A CUSTOMER.

11:54.175 --> 11:56.344
WE'RE CLOSED.
SORRY.

11:56.344 --> 11:59.080
MRS. McALLISTER,
HI.

11:59.080 --> 12:03.017
I, UH -- I'D LIKE
TO TALK TO YOU.

12:03.017 --> 12:05.386
IT'S PERSONAL.

12:05.386 --> 12:06.587
WHAT IS IT?

12:06.587 --> 12:09.056
THERE'S SOMETHING
I WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW.

12:10.892 --> 12:12.393
YOUR...

12:14.729 --> 12:17.665
YOUR HUSBAND --
HE, UM --

12:17.665 --> 12:19.934
WELL,
HE AND I...

12:23.704 --> 12:25.907
UM...

12:25.907 --> 12:27.742
WE FOUGHT
A HARD BATTLE.

12:27.742 --> 12:31.045
AND NOW THAT THE CASE
HAS BEEN DISMISSED, I JUST --

12:31.045 --> 12:33.714
I WANTED TO APOLOGIZE
FOR ANY ANNOYANCE

12:33.714 --> 12:36.250
I MIGHT HAVE CAUSED YOU
OR YOUR FAMILY.

12:36.250 --> 12:37.451
ANNOYANCE?

12:37.451 --> 12:39.954
MY BROTHER WAS IN JAIL
FOR THREE DAYS BECAUSE OF YOU.

12:39.954 --> 12:42.223
WELL, WE MAY HAVE BEEN
TOO AGGRESSIVE.

12:42.223 --> 12:46.027
<i>I</i> MAY HAVE BEEN
TOO AGGRESSIVE.

12:46.027 --> 12:49.764
AND FOR THAT, I'M SORRY --
TRULY.

12:52.800 --> 12:56.837
THANK YOU
FOR HEARING ME OUT.

13:02.410 --> 13:05.546
YOU KNOW,
THERE IS ONE MORE THING.

13:09.050 --> 13:11.719
HEY, UM, I'VE LEFT YOU
A FEW MESSAGES.

13:11.719 --> 13:14.889
WELL, I'M ON MY WAY DOWN,
SO I'LL SEE YOU SOON.

13:18.559 --> 13:20.895
MR. McALLISTER, I WAS BROUGHT IN
TO MANAGE THIS OFFICE

13:20.895 --> 13:23.064
TO CLEAN UP THE MESS MADE
BY DREW STAFFORD

13:23.064 --> 13:25.833
AND LARRY ABRAMS ON THE, UH,
MROZEK MURDER INVESTIGATION.

13:25.833 --> 13:28.135
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT CASE
SPUN OUT OF CONTROL.

13:28.135 --> 13:29.904
WELL,
WE CAN AGREE ON THAT,

13:29.904 --> 13:33.474
BUT I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU WANTED ME TO COME IN.

13:33.474 --> 13:35.242
WE RESPECT
THE CONTRIBUTIONS MADE

13:35.242 --> 13:37.578
BY THE KARSTENS
TO THE COMMUNITY, TO THE MAYOR,

13:37.578 --> 13:38.579
THE STATE'S ATTORNEY,

13:38.579 --> 13:39.680
TO BOTH
OF THEIR ELECTION CAMPAIGNS.

13:39.680 --> 13:41.082
I JUST WANTED
TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GOOD.

13:41.082 --> 13:44.752
I NO LONGER WORK
FOR THATCHER KARSTEN.

13:44.752 --> 13:46.587
REALLY?
I HAD NO IDEA.

13:46.587 --> 13:48.089
WELL, I'M SORRY
TO HAVE WASTED YOUR TIME.

13:48.089 --> 13:49.156
YEAH.

13:49.156 --> 13:51.659
DON'T BE TOO HARD
ON STAFFORD.

13:51.659 --> 13:53.260
HE WAS JUST
DOING HIS JOB.

14:00.301 --> 14:02.003
I SAW ELAINE TODAY.

14:02.003 --> 14:04.505
THE OSSOBUCCO
AT HER PLACE --

14:04.505 --> 14:08.142
BEST I EVER HAD.

14:23.929 --> 14:25.097
HOWARD?

14:25.097 --> 14:26.598
MAY I ASK WHY JACK McALLISTER
WAS JUST --

14:26.598 --> 14:27.666
NO,
YOU MAY NOT.

14:27.666 --> 14:29.268
HERE'S HOW IT GOES
FROM NOW ON --

14:29.268 --> 14:31.779
I TALK,
AND YOU NOD APPRECIATIVELY.

14:31.779 --> 14:33.281
YOU'RE ON PROBATION,
STAFFORD.

14:33.281 --> 14:35.650
I'M WELL AWARE
I WAS A LITTLE AMBITIOUS AND --

14:35.650 --> 14:36.651
GOOD.

14:36.651 --> 14:38.920
THEN BE AWARE
OF THESE.

14:38.920 --> 14:44.159
NEW CASES, ALL YOURS,
THE ONLY CASES YOU'LL WORK.

14:44.159 --> 14:45.693
SIR, I'M
A FIRST-CHAIR PROSECUTOR.

14:45.693 --> 14:47.762
YOU'RE GIVING ME D.U.I.s?
I AM.

14:47.762 --> 14:49.364
AND LET ME
BE CRYSTAL CLEAR --

14:49.364 --> 14:51.166
YOUR EYEBALLS WANDER
ONE MILLIMETER

14:51.166 --> 14:52.634
FROM THOSE
SONS OF BITCHES,

14:52.634 --> 14:55.670
AND YOU CAN KISS YOUR CAREER
IN GOVERNMENT GOODBYE.

14:55.670 --> 14:59.374
THE LOU MROZEK CASE
IS OVER.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.021
HEY.
HEY.

15:13.021 --> 15:15.156
I WAS
AT THE PROSECUTOR'S OFFICE,

15:15.156 --> 15:17.659
WRAPPING UP SOME STUFF
WITH T.J.'s CASE.

15:17.659 --> 15:19.827
I RAN
INTO DREW STAFFORD.

15:19.827 --> 15:22.564
HE SAID
HE CAME BY THE RESTAURANT.

15:22.564 --> 15:26.668
YES, HE DID.

15:26.668 --> 15:29.571
WHAT DID HE WANT?

15:29.571 --> 15:30.939
WELL,
BELIEVE IT OR NOT,

15:30.939 --> 15:33.808
HE WANTED TO APOLOGIZE FOR
PUTTING OUR FAMILY THROUGH HELL.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.043
ANYTHING ELSE?

15:35.043 --> 15:37.679
YEAH, HE SAID HE READ A REVIEW
OF MY OSSOBUCCO

15:37.679 --> 15:39.981
AND HE WANTED
TO MAKE A RESERVATION,

15:39.981 --> 15:43.384
THAT HIS WIFE'S BIRTHDAY
WAS COMING UP.

15:43.384 --> 15:45.820
WH-WH-WHAT
ARE YOU DOING?

15:45.820 --> 15:47.455
OH, WELL, I WAS PACKING
FOR THE TRIP,

15:47.455 --> 15:50.024
BUT I DID GET A LITTLE CARRIED
AWAY IN CLEANING EVERYTHING OUT.

15:50.024 --> 15:52.460
IT'S MY NEW MISSION --
SIMPLIFY EVERYTHING.

15:52.460 --> 15:53.595
WHAT TRIP?

15:53.595 --> 15:57.232
LAST NIGHT.

15:57.232 --> 15:59.267
DOOR COUNTY?

15:59.267 --> 16:02.637
I GOT US THAT SAME PLACE
IN BAILEYS HARBOR --

16:02.637 --> 16:04.572
THE CABIN
BY THE LAKE.

16:04.572 --> 16:05.707
OKAY?

16:05.707 --> 16:08.776
SO, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE
FOUR DAYS OF NOTHING --

16:08.776 --> 16:11.412
NO KIDS, NO CASE,
NO KARSTEN ALLIED.

16:11.412 --> 16:13.648
IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME.

16:13.648 --> 16:16.618
ELAINE,
PLEASE.

16:16.618 --> 16:20.321
WE'RE NOT GOING
TO BAILEYS HARBOR.

16:43.011 --> 16:45.346
SARA?

16:49.751 --> 16:52.053
4:00 IN THE MORNING?
YEAH.

16:52.053 --> 16:54.555
THE SISTER I GREW UP WITH
NEVER GOT UP BEFORE NOON.

16:54.555 --> 16:56.791
WELL, THIS JOB AT THE BAKERY
RELAXES ME.

16:56.791 --> 16:59.627
AND ALSO GETTING UP SO EARLY
KEEPS ME OUT OF TROUBLE.

16:59.627 --> 17:02.130
I MEAN, CAN'T REALLY SHOW UP
TO WORK HUNG OVER

17:02.130 --> 17:03.598
AT 4:00
IN THE MORNING.

17:03.598 --> 17:05.300
HOW LONG
HAS IT BEEN?

17:05.300 --> 17:07.435
10 MONTHS.
AND YOU FEEL GOOD?

17:07.435 --> 17:09.971
I FEEL REALLY GOOD
MOST OF THE TIME.

17:09.971 --> 17:11.139
AND WHEN
I HAVE A BAD DAY,

17:11.139 --> 17:14.008
I JUST CALL MY SPONSOR,
GO TO A MEETING.

17:14.008 --> 17:16.277
SOMETIMES,
I CALL MOM AND DAD.

17:16.277 --> 17:19.480
ALL THEY DO IS TALK ABOUT YOU
ALL THE TIME --

17:19.480 --> 17:22.817
WELL, MOSTLY ABOUT
THEIR ONE AND ONLY GRANDSON.

17:24.585 --> 17:26.854
YOU ALL RIGHT,
SARA?

17:26.854 --> 17:29.490
YEAH.
WHY? I'M FINE.

17:29.490 --> 17:30.925
DON'T TAKE THIS
THE WRONG WAY,

17:30.925 --> 17:34.362
BUT WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

17:34.362 --> 17:35.496
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:35.496 --> 17:37.365
I CAME TO SEE YOU.
COME ON.

17:37.365 --> 17:39.534
WE'VE BARELY SPOKEN
IN YEARS.

17:39.534 --> 17:42.704
YOU DRIVE ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE
JUST TO SAY HI.

17:42.704 --> 17:43.905
WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:45.973 --> 17:49.977
IT WASN'T SOMETHING
I WAS LOOKING FOR...

17:49.977 --> 17:51.779
OR EVER IMAGINED.

17:51.779 --> 17:56.884
AND EVERYTHING YOU BELIEVED
ABOUT US, I BELIEVED, TOO.

17:56.884 --> 17:58.286
I WAS HAPPY.

17:58.286 --> 18:02.657
AND THEN THIS...

18:02.657 --> 18:07.228
WELL,
IT HAPPENED.

18:09.297 --> 18:10.798
I'M SITTING HERE,

18:10.798 --> 18:14.969
AND I'M WAITING FOR YOU
TO TELL ME THAT YOU LOVE ME,

18:14.969 --> 18:16.804
THAT YOU LOVE OUR KIDS,

18:16.804 --> 18:19.140
AND THAT YOU DON'T WANT
TO BREAK UP OUR FAMILY

18:19.140 --> 18:23.978
AND THAT...
YOU WANT TO BE FORGIVEN

18:23.978 --> 18:27.949
FOR YOUR SELFISHNESS
AND YOUR STUPIDITY.

18:30.318 --> 18:32.653
OH, WAIT.

18:33.988 --> 18:35.289
IT JUST HIT ME --

18:35.289 --> 18:38.192
YOU WON'T SAY THAT
BECAUSE YOU LOVE HER.

18:38.192 --> 18:40.828
YOU'RE IN LOVE
WITH HER.

18:40.828 --> 18:44.832
YOU -- YOU THINK
YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HER.

18:50.505 --> 18:53.174
NO.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.579
I SHOULD HAVE RESPONDED
TO YOUR E-MAILS,

18:58.579 --> 19:00.982
COME DOWN AND HELPED YOU
DURING REHAB.

19:00.982 --> 19:01.983
I GET IT.

19:01.983 --> 19:04.085
I MADE YOUR LIFE MISERABLE
FOR YEARS.

19:04.085 --> 19:06.187
YOU MISS
A LOT OF BIRTHDAYS,

19:06.187 --> 19:08.756
YOU'VE GOT A LOT OF MAKING UP
TO DO.

19:08.756 --> 19:10.825
YEAH,
BUT I WAS TOO HARD ON YOU.

19:10.825 --> 19:12.360
I WAS
TOO JUDGMENTAL.

19:12.360 --> 19:13.361
IT WASN'T FAIR.

19:13.361 --> 19:19.300
THE TRUTH IS
THAT I --

19:19.300 --> 19:21.736
I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU COULD MESS YOUR LIFE UP

19:21.736 --> 19:23.738
OVER AND OVER.

19:23.738 --> 19:30.077
BUT NOW I DO BECAUSE
I'M IN A BIT OF A MESS MYSELF.

19:32.713 --> 19:36.217
I'M -- I'M HAVING
AN AFFAIR.

19:36.217 --> 19:38.586
HE'S MARRIED.

19:38.586 --> 19:41.856
AND DREW FOUND OUT.

19:44.158 --> 19:46.160
I LOVE HIM.

19:48.329 --> 19:50.431
TELL ME
THAT I'M NOT CRAZY.

19:50.431 --> 19:52.767
TELL ME
I'M NOT LOSING MY MIND.

19:52.767 --> 19:55.703
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THAT, SARA.

19:55.703 --> 19:58.206
I THINK
YOU'RE BEING A FOOL.

20:02.777 --> 20:03.845
A<i> CONNECTION?</i>

20:03.845 --> 20:05.746
DO YOU REALLY THINK
THAT THIS IS GONNA LAST?

20:05.746 --> 20:09.016
I MEAN, AFTER -- AFTER 20 YEARS
OF MARRIAGE, DO YOU --

20:13.187 --> 20:15.189
THAT'S HERS,
ISN'T IT?

20:28.035 --> 20:30.137
I HAVE BEEN WALKING BY
THIS THING

20:30.137 --> 20:32.940
IN MY OWN HOUSE,

20:32.940 --> 20:34.609
AND YOU LET ME!

20:34.609 --> 20:36.444
YOU SON OF A BITCH!

20:36.444 --> 20:38.212
YOU LYING COWARD!

20:38.212 --> 20:39.580
YOU...

20:46.988 --> 20:51.559
YOU'VE DESTROYED THIS FAMILY.

21:05.378 --> 21:07.213
ARE YOU GUYS OKAY?

21:13.720 --> 21:15.888
YOU DID THIS.

21:15.888 --> 21:18.157
YOU TELL THEM.

21:29.569 --> 21:36.209
UH, YOUR MOM AND I --
WE'RE DEALING WITH SOME STUFF.

21:36.209 --> 21:39.312
WE WANT YOU BOTH TO KNOW,
THOUGH, NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

21:39.312 --> 21:40.780
WE --
WE LOVE YOU VERY --

21:40.780 --> 21:43.349
WHAT STUFF?

21:50.490 --> 21:52.392
I'VE MET SOMEONE.

21:56.963 --> 21:58.564
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

21:58.564 --> 22:01.067
IT MEANS
HE'S CHEATING ON MOM.

22:16.816 --> 22:21.888
DUCKING THE FEDS,
FIXING THAT ALDERMAN SITUATION.

22:21.888 --> 22:25.258
I HOPE EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN
DOING IS HELPFUL, THATCHER.

22:25.258 --> 22:27.560
NO,
I APPRECIATE IT.

22:27.560 --> 22:32.799
WELL, I WANT YOU TO KNOW
YOU CAN RELY ON ME FOR ANYTHING.

22:32.799 --> 22:37.403
THE STUFF JACK DID,
THE STUFF JACK NEVER WOULD --

22:37.403 --> 22:39.372
WHATEVER YOU NEED --
I CAN HANDLE IT.

22:39.372 --> 22:42.742
YOU A LAWYER?

22:43.843 --> 22:47.146
DID YOU EVEN MAKE IT
PAST THE 10th GRADE?

22:47.146 --> 22:52.285
IT'S NOT THAT EASY
TO STEP INTO JACK'S SHOES.

22:53.886 --> 22:59.592
MAYBE NOT, BUT I HAVE
OTHER SKILLS THAT ARE USEFUL.

23:02.161 --> 23:04.330
TAKE A LOOK.

23:57.016 --> 23:58.184
I REALLY NEVER THOUGHT

23:58.184 --> 23:59.652
THAT YOU'D REACT
LIKE THIS.

23:59.652 --> 24:02.188
I THOUGHT BECAUSE YOU'VE BEEN
THERE YOURSELF, THAT MAYBE --

24:02.188 --> 24:03.423
THAT MAYBE WHAT?

24:03.423 --> 24:05.758
I'D JUST ENCOURAGE YOU
TO BLOW YOUR LIFE UP?

24:05.758 --> 24:07.360
NO,
BUT UNDERSTAND.

24:07.360 --> 24:08.728
I GET IT.

24:08.728 --> 24:14.634
I JUST CAN'T BE A CHEERLEADER
FOR YOU WHILE YOU SELF-DESTRUCT.

24:14.634 --> 24:16.369
WHAT IF
I'M GETTING HAPPIER?

24:16.369 --> 24:18.304
ISN'T THAT
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

24:18.304 --> 24:19.672
YOU BOUNCED BACK BETTER.

24:19.672 --> 24:21.140
YOU'RE KIDDING,
RIGHT?

24:21.140 --> 24:25.378
I'M ESTRANGED FROM EVERYONE
WHO EVER LOVED ME.

24:25.378 --> 24:29.882
AND ALL THOSE PEOPLE YOU HURT --
THEY NEVER FORGIVE YOU.

24:29.882 --> 24:33.386
THEY MIGHT SAY THEY DO.

24:33.386 --> 24:35.888
NO,
THEY NEVER GET OVER IT.

24:42.728 --> 24:45.898
JACK ASKED ME
NOT TO SHOW YOU.

24:45.898 --> 24:49.335
I WAS TRYING
TO BE A TEAM PLAYER.

24:49.335 --> 24:50.436
I TRIED REAL --

24:50.436 --> 24:52.405
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU,
DAD.

24:52.405 --> 24:54.440
THIS ISN'T
A GOOD TIME, T.J.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.441
I DON'T CARE.

24:55.441 --> 24:57.977
I'M TIRED OF YOU
CONTROLLING MY LIFE.

24:57.977 --> 25:00.713
FROM NOW ON,
I WORK WHERE I WANT TO WORK,

25:00.713 --> 25:03.149
AND IF I WANT BRANDY
TO BE MY GIRL,

25:03.149 --> 25:04.617
THEN YOU
STAY OUT OF IT.

25:04.617 --> 25:06.185
BRANDY IS NO GOOD
FOR YOU.

25:06.185 --> 25:07.286
<i>I</i> GET TO SAY.

25:07.286 --> 25:08.921
<i>YOU</i> DON'T GET
TO SAY.

25:08.921 --> 25:11.290
I DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT THIS NOW.

25:11.290 --> 25:14.060
I'M GONNA MARRY HER.

25:15.628 --> 25:17.864
YOU'RE WHAT?

25:17.864 --> 25:19.832
I NEED
TO GET MOM'S RING.

25:19.832 --> 25:23.336
WHEN SHE DIED, SHE GAVE IT
TO ME TO GIVE TO MY WIFE.

25:23.336 --> 25:25.771
DON'T BE STUPID.

25:25.771 --> 25:27.607
DON'T CALL ME THAT.
THE WOMAN'S A WHORE.

25:27.607 --> 25:28.841
YOU DON'T SAY THAT.

25:28.841 --> 25:30.676
I PAID HER TO BE NICE TO YOU,
TO SPEND TIME WITH YOU.

25:30.676 --> 25:31.677
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

25:31.677 --> 25:33.079
SHE LIKES ME.

25:33.079 --> 25:35.281
SHE'S AN FBI INFORMANT.

25:35.281 --> 25:37.049
THEY WANT
TO PUT ME IN PRISON.

25:37.049 --> 25:39.085
YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO BE HAPPY.

25:39.085 --> 25:40.119
YOU NEVER HAVE.

25:40.119 --> 25:41.254
YOU'LL SAY ANYTHING.

25:41.254 --> 25:42.488
DAMN IT, T.J.!

25:44.557 --> 25:46.859
YOU STAY AWAY
FROM HER.

25:46.859 --> 25:48.060
YOU HEAR ME?

25:48.060 --> 25:52.832
THE BEST THING WOULD BE
FOR THAT GIRL TO DISAPPEAR

25:52.832 --> 25:57.303
FROM BOTH OUR LIVES FOREVER.

25:59.839 --> 26:05.745
I USED TO THINK I WAS SO LUCKY
BEING YOUR SON.

26:05.745 --> 26:09.181
I NEVER
THINK THAT ANYMORE.

26:25.069 --> 26:29.240
■

26:29.240 --> 26:30.448
YOU THE OWNER?

26:30.448 --> 26:32.316
ARE YOU A COP?

26:33.963 --> 26:36.520
COOK COUNTY
PROSECUTOR.

26:39.724 --> 26:41.800
DARIUS MILLER.

26:41.800 --> 26:45.404
HE WORKED HERE,
RIGHT?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.542
SO, YOU KNOW
HE WAS SHOT?

26:50.542 --> 26:54.479
I SAW IT
ON THE TV.

26:56.948 --> 26:59.282
SWEET IMPALA.

26:59.282 --> 27:01.083
FANCY CLIENTELE,
HUH?

27:01.083 --> 27:04.320
NOT REALLY,
BUT WE DO ALL RIGHT.

27:07.390 --> 27:09.292
YOU KNOW
IF LIL' D WAS CONNECTED

27:09.292 --> 27:11.394
WITH THE KARSTEN FAMILY
AT ALL?

27:11.394 --> 27:12.495
THE WHO FAMILY?

27:12.495 --> 27:14.530
THATCHER KARSTEN --
REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS.

27:14.530 --> 27:17.033
I DON'T KNOW ANYONE
NAMED<i> THATCHER,</i>

27:17.033 --> 27:19.769
AND I DON'T IMAGINE
LIL' D DID, EITHER.

27:19.769 --> 27:22.071
WOULD YOU CONSIDER HIM
A FRIEND?

27:22.071 --> 27:25.841
HE WAS A GOOD KID.

27:25.841 --> 27:27.076
I LIKED HIM.

27:27.076 --> 27:28.744
CAPABLE OF MURDER?

27:28.744 --> 27:31.881
HE DIDN'T KILL
THAT OLD WHITE MAN BY THE RIVER

27:31.881 --> 27:33.783
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU MEAN.

27:33.783 --> 27:38.788
I DON'T THINK HE DID, EITHER,
BUT I CAN'T PROVE IT.

27:38.788 --> 27:43.225
NOW EVERYONE I WORK WITH
THINKS I'VE LOST IT.

27:45.878 --> 27:47.279
SOUNDS ROUGH
FOR YOU.

28:02.494 --> 28:04.530
CHEERS.

28:05.864 --> 28:08.534
HEY, REMEMBER WHEN I CAME
TO CHICAGO TO VISIT YOU

28:08.534 --> 28:09.768
TO MAKE AMENDS?

28:09.768 --> 28:11.770
WHICH TIME?

28:11.770 --> 28:14.640
WE WENT FOR THAT WALK
IN LINCOLN PARK.

28:14.640 --> 28:16.842
I KEPT TRYING
TO APOLOGIZE,

28:16.842 --> 28:20.713
BUT YOU'D JUST SAY IT WAS FINE
AND CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

28:20.713 --> 28:22.815
YOU NEVER REALLY WANTED
TO TALK TO ME

28:22.815 --> 28:24.616
ABOUT ALL
THOSE BAD TIMES.

28:24.616 --> 28:27.720
YEAH, WELL, IT JUST SEEMED
EASIER TO LEAVE IT ALONE.

28:27.720 --> 28:32.057
HEY, YOU KNOW, YOU ARE ALLOWED
TO BE ANGRY AT ME.

28:32.057 --> 28:33.192
YEAH,
I KNOW.

28:33.192 --> 28:34.560
DO YOU?

28:34.560 --> 28:36.995
YEAH, BUT WHAT'S THE POINT
IN SAYING ALL THOSE THINGS?

28:36.995 --> 28:38.530
WHERE DOES IT
GET US?

28:38.530 --> 28:42.201
WELL, CLOSER,
MAYBE.

28:44.369 --> 28:46.371
WELL, THANKS FOR THE COFFEE
AND THE BREAD.

28:46.371 --> 28:49.007
RIGHT.
SEE YOU AROUND.

28:52.745 --> 28:54.613
WHAT DO YOU WANT FROM ME,
CHLO?

28:54.613 --> 28:55.948
IT'S JUST THE TRUTH.

28:55.948 --> 28:58.350
YOU'VE BEEN ANGRY ABOUT IT
FOR YEARS.

28:58.350 --> 29:00.385
YOU REALLY WANT
TO HEAR IT,

29:00.385 --> 29:03.088
HOW YOU CONSUMED
MOM AND DAD'S ATTENTION,

29:03.088 --> 29:06.058
ALL OF IT, HOW THERE'S NOT
A DROP LEFT FOR ME,

29:06.058 --> 29:07.926
HOW IN HIGH SCHOOL,
I LAY IN BED

29:07.926 --> 29:10.362
WONDERING HOW MANY CAR WRECKS
YOU WERE AWAY

29:10.362 --> 29:12.030
FROM GETTING YOURSELF
KILLED?

29:12.030 --> 29:15.100
ASKING ME TO HIDE YOUR COKE
IN MY MAKEUP BAG

29:15.100 --> 29:16.735
BECAUSE MOM
CHECKED YOURS?

29:16.735 --> 29:19.371
OR YOUR DRUGGIE BOYFRIEND,
JIMMY, HITTING ON ME

29:19.371 --> 29:21.073
AFTER YOU PASS OUT
IN THE BASEMENT

29:21.073 --> 29:23.041
BECAUSE YOU WERE
SO HIGH?

29:23.041 --> 29:24.877
OR THAT TIME --

29:26.712 --> 29:28.547
OR THE TIME I FOUND YOU

29:28.547 --> 29:32.518
IN THE BATHROOM
WITH A RAZOR AND ALL THE BLOOD?

29:32.518 --> 29:34.720
IS THAT
WHAT YOU WANT?

29:34.720 --> 29:37.489
IS THAT REALLY
GONNA MAKE US CLOSER?

29:40.559 --> 29:42.561
I'M SORRY I PUT YOU THROUGH

29:42.561 --> 29:44.997
ALL THOSE THINGS.

29:50.035 --> 29:52.037
I AM.

29:56.542 --> 29:58.677
I KNOW.

30:04.516 --> 30:06.418
MAYBE NOW
WE'RE BOTH SCREW-UPS,

30:06.418 --> 30:08.554
WE CAN ACTUALLY
SPEND CHRISTMAS TOGETHER.

30:13.425 --> 30:15.494
I'D LIKE THAT.

30:38.116 --> 30:39.918
HI, DAD.

31:02.374 --> 31:03.675
DON'T SCREAM.

31:07.079 --> 31:08.247
SIT.

31:11.149 --> 31:13.318
I'M NOT
GONNA HURT YOU.

31:19.758 --> 31:23.929
I'M HERE TO MAKE YOU A DEAL
ON BEHALF OF MR. KARSTEN.

31:27.332 --> 31:28.867
WHERE'S YOUR DAUGHTER?

31:28.867 --> 31:31.970
AT THE NEIGHBOR'S.

31:31.970 --> 31:35.540
THIS IS HOW
THIS IS ALL GONNA GO DOWN.

31:35.540 --> 31:39.678
MR. KARSTEN WILL WIRE YOU
$250,000.

31:39.678 --> 31:41.580
IT IS
A ONE-TIME FEE.

31:41.580 --> 31:42.948
YOU WILL TAKE IT,

31:42.948 --> 31:44.483
AND YOU WILL MOVE
WITH YOUR DAUGHTER

31:44.483 --> 31:47.686
TO ANOTHER CITY
WITHIN ONE WEEK.

31:47.686 --> 31:51.089
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND ME?

31:51.089 --> 31:53.525
YES OR NO?

31:53.525 --> 31:55.294
HOW DO I JUST --

31:55.294 --> 31:58.497
NO, THAT'S NOT A YES
OR A NO.

31:58.497 --> 32:01.266
DO YOU
UNDERSTAND?

32:03.068 --> 32:04.169
YES.

32:04.169 --> 32:06.672
CAN YOU STAY AWAY
FROM MR. KARSTEN'S SON?

32:06.672 --> 32:08.740
YES OR NO?

32:08.740 --> 32:10.676
YES.

32:10.676 --> 32:13.078
THEN WE
SHOULD HAVE A TOAST.

32:13.078 --> 32:15.047
DO YOU HAVE
ANY BOOZE?

32:15.047 --> 32:19.685
UM...
GIN UNDER THE SINK.

32:19.685 --> 32:21.853
THAT'LL DO.

32:29.027 --> 32:30.996
KORSKAYA.

32:30.996 --> 32:33.198
THAT'S, UH,
LITHUANIAN, RIGHT?

32:33.198 --> 32:34.366
YEAH.

32:34.366 --> 32:36.101
MY PEOPLE
ARE POLISH.

32:36.101 --> 32:39.271
GRANDPARENTS ARE FROM,
UH, ELBLAG.

32:39.271 --> 32:42.507
THAT'S NEAR LITHUANIA.

32:42.507 --> 32:46.845
YOU KNOW, MAYBE OUR ANCESTORS
ACTUALLY KNEW EACH OTHER.

32:55.320 --> 32:57.155
NA ZDROWIE.

33:03.228 --> 33:04.429
I JUST NEVER THOUGHT

33:04.429 --> 33:07.733
THAT HE COULD DO
ANYTHING LIKE THIS TO ME.

33:07.733 --> 33:09.234
DID YOU?

33:09.234 --> 33:12.070
NO.

33:12.070 --> 33:16.842
HE WAS ACTING STRANGE LATELY,
BUT I THOUGHT IT WAS...

33:16.842 --> 33:17.876
I DON'T KNOW.

33:17.876 --> 33:19.611
I ASSUMED
IT WAS YOU.

33:19.611 --> 33:20.612
ME?

33:20.612 --> 33:24.249
I MEAN WORK,
YOU KNOW, THE CASE.

33:24.249 --> 33:28.487
WAS I THE ONLY ONE
WHO DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT THIS?

33:28.487 --> 33:29.955
DID YOU KNOW?

33:29.955 --> 33:32.657
I HAD NO IDEA.

33:32.657 --> 33:36.228
MY GRANDMOTHER USED TO MAKE
THIS LITHUANIAN SOUP.

33:36.228 --> 33:37.863
IT WAS AMAZING.

33:37.863 --> 33:40.866
IT WAS, UH,
BOILED POTATOES,

33:40.866 --> 33:44.302
SOUR CREAM, BUTTERMILK,
AND DILL.

33:44.302 --> 33:45.771
DID YOU
EVER HAVE IT?

33:45.771 --> 33:46.972
YEAH.

33:46.972 --> 33:49.908
I FEEL --
THE ROOM IS SPINNING.

33:49.908 --> 33:51.810
HERE.

33:57.783 --> 34:00.018
LIE DOWN,
HON.

34:00.018 --> 34:02.921
YEAH,
JUST LIE DOWN RIGHT HERE.

34:04.189 --> 34:06.291
YEAH.
THERE YOU ARE.

34:20.505 --> 34:23.275
I LOVE YOU,
LAINIE.

34:23.275 --> 34:25.710
YOU'RE GONNA GET THROUGH
THIS THING.

34:25.710 --> 34:28.013
I KNOW YOU FEEL
REALLY VULNERABLE

34:28.013 --> 34:32.117
AND ALONE RIGHT NOW,
BUT YOU'RE NOT.

34:42.127 --> 34:44.596
I'M GONNA TAKE CARE
OF YOU...

34:49.367 --> 34:54.139
...PROTECT YOU.

35:35.614 --> 35:38.450
YOU'RE MY DAUGHTER.

35:41.520 --> 35:44.856
WE'RE A FAMILY
OF FIGHTERS...

35:44.856 --> 35:47.125
AND SURVIVORS.

35:47.125 --> 35:50.162
WE ALWAYS
COME OUT ON TOP.

36:15.250 --> 36:17.252
CAN WE TALK?

36:20.856 --> 36:24.062
I'M SORRY,
AND I KNOW HOW THAT SOUNDS.

36:24.062 --> 36:26.131
YEAH.

36:26.131 --> 36:28.033
PRETTY WEAK.

36:31.069 --> 36:35.741
DREW...
PLEASE TALK TO ME.

36:35.741 --> 36:37.242
TELL ME
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO NOW.

36:37.242 --> 36:39.377
WHAT CAN I SAY?

36:40.879 --> 36:42.848
WHEN DID YOU FIRST HAVE SEX
WITH HIM?

36:46.051 --> 36:47.719
WHEN?

36:51.056 --> 36:53.358
A FEW DAYS
AFTER THE GALLERY EVENT.

36:53.358 --> 36:56.128
WHERE DID YOU
FIRST HAVE SEX?

36:56.128 --> 36:58.196
IT'S NOT ABOUT --
WHERE?

36:58.196 --> 37:00.532
MY STUDIO,
IF YOU HAVE TO --

37:00.532 --> 37:01.800
HOW ABOUT HERE?

37:01.800 --> 37:03.368
DID YOU --
STOP.

37:03.368 --> 37:05.070
DID YOU?
NO. OKAY?

37:05.070 --> 37:06.104
WHY NOT?

37:06.104 --> 37:07.873
BECAUSE I WOULDN'T.

37:07.873 --> 37:09.908
OUT OF GUILT?
DREW.

37:09.908 --> 37:10.909
HOW ABOUT HIM?

37:10.909 --> 37:12.210
DID HE WANT
TO DO IT HERE?

37:12.210 --> 37:13.879
HE'S NOT LIKE THAT.

37:13.879 --> 37:16.148
OH, HE'S TOO HONORABLE,
RIGHT?

37:16.148 --> 37:17.415
PLEASE.

37:17.415 --> 37:21.086
WHY DON'T WE TALK ABOUT
REAL THINGS BETWEEN US,

37:21.086 --> 37:22.154
YOU AND ME?

37:22.154 --> 37:24.489
LIKE WHAT?

37:24.489 --> 37:28.059
HOW YOU'VE TAKEN ME FOR GRANTED
FOR YEARS.

37:28.059 --> 37:31.263
OH, SO NOW IT'S ABOUT
WHAT I HAVEN'T DONE FOR YOU?

37:31.263 --> 37:35.233
NO, BUT, DREW, THIS DIDN'T
JUST HAPPEN IN A VACUUM.

37:35.233 --> 37:38.036
I MET SOMEONE
AT THE EXACT MOMENT

37:38.036 --> 37:40.505
THAT I WAS FALLING
INTO UNHAPPINESS WITH OUR LIFE.

37:40.505 --> 37:41.506
OUR LIFE?

37:41.506 --> 37:44.109
WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG
WITH OUR LIFE?

37:44.109 --> 37:46.845
IT'S ALL ABOUT YOU.

37:46.845 --> 37:49.848
OUR MARRIAGE HAS ALWAYS
JUST BEEN ABOUT YOU,

37:49.848 --> 37:51.883
YOUR PLANS,
YOUR AMBITIONS.

37:51.883 --> 37:54.219
OH, SO I SHOULD FEEL ASHAMED
ABOUT MY ASPIRATIONS?

37:54.219 --> 37:57.189
NO, BUT YOU'VE TURNED ME
INTO SOME SORT OF ACCESSORY,

37:57.189 --> 37:58.390
AND I LET IT HAPPEN.

37:58.390 --> 37:59.591
WE BOTH DID.

37:59.591 --> 38:01.760
I SHOULD HAVE REALIZED THIS
A LONG TIME AGO.

38:01.760 --> 38:04.462
THAT'S MY FAULT.

38:04.462 --> 38:07.499
WE HAVEN'T BEEN HAPPY,
DREW.

38:07.499 --> 38:09.701
WE'VE BEEN PRETENDING.

38:09.701 --> 38:13.371
AND I KNOW THAT NOW.

38:13.371 --> 38:17.642
AND I THINK
YOU KNOW IT, TOO.

38:25.283 --> 38:28.420
WE WERE HAPPY ONCE,
WEREN'T WE?

38:31.823 --> 38:34.960
I THOUGHT --
I THOUGHT SO.

38:37.329 --> 38:39.030
I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT HAPPY WAS.

38:45.503 --> 38:48.607
I'M SORRY THAT IT ALL
HAPPENED LIKE THIS.

39:28.580 --> 39:30.415
BRANDY?

39:31.583 --> 39:33.418
ARE YOU HOME?

39:37.689 --> 39:41.326
BRANDY?

39:55.974 --> 39:57.108
WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

39:57.108 --> 39:58.710
I THOUGHT
THAT YOU HAD THE NIGHT OFF.

39:58.710 --> 40:01.746
I WAS
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

41:12.817 --> 41:14.786
ARE YOU OKAY?

41:17.122 --> 41:19.624
WELL,
I'VE BEEN BETTER.

41:19.624 --> 41:22.460
DOES YOUR WIFE KNOW?

41:29.467 --> 41:31.036
YOU KNOW,
I'VE JUST --

41:31.036 --> 41:33.638
I'VE MADE
SO MANY WRONG CHOICES IN MY LIFE

41:33.638 --> 41:36.741
THAT I THOUGHT
WERE RIGHT.

41:36.741 --> 41:39.944
NOW I DON'T TRUST MYSELF.

41:39.944 --> 41:42.580
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

41:45.083 --> 41:46.584
LET'S GO INSIDE.

41:48.253 --> 41:53.958
MAYBE I SHOULD JUST GET
A HOTEL ROOM, RAID THE MINI BAR.

41:55.527 --> 41:57.662
STAY.

41:57.662 --> 42:01.032
PLEASE.

42:01.032 --> 42:04.102
LET'S NOT
BE ALONE TONIGHT.
