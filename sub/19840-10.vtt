00:00.001 --> 00:04.236
<i>Previously on</i> Greenleaf...

00:04.238 --> 00:06.338
- We cover the debt.
- You give us Triumph II.

00:06.340 --> 00:08.507
That way, the money gets replaced
and you don't go to jail.

00:08.509 --> 00:10.709
You keep your church,
and we get ours.

00:10.711 --> 00:13.645
We have the opportunity
to do something together.

00:13.647 --> 00:17.216
We copastor, build whatever
we want across the street.

00:17.218 --> 00:20.552
I don't need a copastor any more
than I need a cane to walk with.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.187
I ain't done nothing to nobody.

00:22.189 --> 00:24.023
Yeah, you did.
You hurt those girls.

00:24.025 --> 00:25.724
- You are sick!
- Stupid bitch!

00:27.461 --> 00:31.497
They didn't do anything
they didn't want to.

00:35.369 --> 00:38.070
Mac is dead. How can
this be without scandal?

00:38.072 --> 00:40.672
It was selfdefense.
Grace is a hero.

00:40.674 --> 00:43.609
And if I ask what you think, you
think it's great or you shut up.

00:43.611 --> 00:46.645
The Zora I know would never let
anyone talk sideways to her.

00:46.647 --> 00:48.113
Fine, I'll dump him.

00:48.115 --> 00:49.782
I am grateful for Robert.

00:49.784 --> 00:52.217
He wasn't always
the devil he became.

00:52.219 --> 00:56.221
Sometimes I think that Mac
became the way he was

00:56.223 --> 00:59.324
watching Daddy,
what he did to me.

01:03.264 --> 01:04.763
<i>This is Mavis McCready.</i>

01:04.765 --> 01:06.765
<i>If you're looking to book
Alonzo Ashbury,</i>

01:06.767 --> 01:09.201
<i>leave your name,
your venue, and a date.</i>

01:09.203 --> 01:11.103
<i>I'll get back to you.</i>

01:11.105 --> 01:13.272
<i>Anybody else, speak your
piece, keep it brief.</i>

01:13.274 --> 01:15.641
<i>Don't fill up my mailbox.</i>

01:15.643 --> 01:17.643
Mavis, it's Mae.

01:17.645 --> 01:21.313
We're gathering
at Moss Lake next Saturday

01:21.315 --> 01:24.183
at sunset
to scatter Robert's ashes.

01:24.185 --> 01:26.785
I thought you should know.

01:26.787 --> 01:30.589
James, myself, Jacob, Charity.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.659
I'm not asking Grace
for obvious reasons.

01:36.397 --> 01:41.567
Lord knows we have had
our distances, Mavis,

01:41.569 --> 01:42.801
in this family.

01:44.805 --> 01:46.805
Some earned,

01:46.807 --> 01:50.109
some given by God
for who knows why.

01:50.111 --> 01:53.779
II don't pretend to understand.

01:53.781 --> 01:56.648
This life is just
such a vale of tears.

01:56.650 --> 01:57.683
But...

02:00.688 --> 02:03.822
if there's any way that we...

02:03.824 --> 02:06.125
could make a new beginning,

02:06.127 --> 02:10.229
while there's still time
to make one...

02:10.231 --> 02:11.231
you and I...

02:15.569 --> 02:18.170
We'll be there at 5:00 PM.

<i>- Morning.</i>
- Morning.

02:57.411 --> 02:58.410
You sleep okay out here?

02:58.412 --> 03:00.812
Yeah. You?

03:02.449 --> 03:03.448
You know.

03:03.450 --> 03:05.417
Come here. Come here.

03:12.826 --> 03:14.960
I don't think I slept
in on a Sunday morning

03:14.962 --> 03:17.296
since I moved back,
so this is nice.

03:17.298 --> 03:18.797
You gonna make an 11:00?

03:18.799 --> 03:20.966
No.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.968
With everybody gossiping
about me,

03:22.970 --> 03:26.838
getting quiet
when I walk in a room, no.

03:26.840 --> 03:28.574
I honestly don't think
I can walk into

03:28.576 --> 03:29.908
a worship right now anyway.

03:29.910 --> 03:32.578
Well, you didn't do
anything wrong.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.413
At least from what
you told me, anyway.

03:34.415 --> 03:37.549
Yeah, I don't blame them.
It's church, you know?

03:37.551 --> 03:39.551
Everybody's all up
in everybody else's business.

03:39.553 --> 03:43.255
Yeah.

03:47.294 --> 03:48.961
- Whatcha working on?
- Well, this old friend of mine's

03:48.963 --> 03:50.395
the head
of "Bloomberg News" now,

03:50.397 --> 03:52.364
and she keeps asking me whether

03:52.366 --> 03:55.734
I'd be open to come up there.

03:55.736 --> 03:59.905
- A job in New York?
- Yeah.

03:59.907 --> 04:01.807
Are you gonna take it?

04:01.809 --> 04:03.909
I don't know.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.510
I gotta see
if the money's right,

04:05.512 --> 04:07.980
and, you know, if it fits
with everything else.

04:09.883 --> 04:11.450
Good for you.

04:16.923 --> 04:20.291
- Coffee?
- Yeah.

04:20.293 --> 04:21.593
I need to wake up.

05:17.618 --> 05:21.787
So, I asked God,
what should I do?

05:21.789 --> 05:26.058
I mean, I got land but no money
to build a church on it.

05:26.060 --> 05:28.026
<i>I got the heart for Jesus</i>

05:28.028 --> 05:29.928
but not enough people
to share it with.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.963
What should I do?

05:31.965 --> 05:35.734
<i>"Then the soft,
small voice said, "Jacob?</i>

05:35.736 --> 05:38.904
You know what to do."

05:38.906 --> 05:41.473
But I was like, "What?"

05:41.475 --> 05:44.776
<i>But God was patient with me.</i>

05:44.778 --> 05:48.447
And He said, "Jacob..."

05:48.449 --> 05:50.682
I told you in my Word
what to do.

05:50.684 --> 05:54.586
- That's right.
- Feed my sheep.

05:54.588 --> 05:55.620
"Not just with bread," he said.

05:55.622 --> 05:58.890
"Feed my sheep my Word."

05:58.892 --> 06:03.528
That's why I'm here,
to be obedient,

06:03.530 --> 06:07.599
preaching the Word of God
just like Jesus did.

06:07.601 --> 06:11.703
Outside the temple.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.843
- Hey.
- Thought you were skipping church.

06:17.845 --> 06:19.644
I am, I am.

06:19.646 --> 06:22.381
I just wanted to catch Sophia
with the Little Saints.

06:22.383 --> 06:24.015
I think it could be cute.

06:24.017 --> 06:26.618
Well, when am I
gonna see you again?

06:26.620 --> 06:29.654
- Well, you tell me.
- What does that mean?

06:29.656 --> 06:31.923
Just the job.

06:31.925 --> 06:35.494
I wouldn't be leaving
for a while if I took it.

06:35.496 --> 06:37.396
So, you're gonna take it.

06:37.398 --> 06:42.067
I don't know. What's the matter?

06:42.069 --> 06:44.669
Nothing, I just...

06:44.671 --> 06:48.640
Guess want to know if we're
breaking up or whatever.

06:48.642 --> 06:49.642
Well, are we together?

06:52.045 --> 06:55.480
We're something. Come on.

06:55.482 --> 06:58.083
I know we're just hanging out,
but yeah, we're something.

06:58.085 --> 06:59.851
Well, which is why I wanted
to tell you

06:59.853 --> 07:02.988
there's a job offer
on the table.

07:02.990 --> 07:06.625
I didn't want it to come out
of left field if I took it.

07:06.627 --> 07:09.461
Hey, look, we made a deal
when we met, remember?

07:09.463 --> 07:13.131
I wouldn't write
about your family or Calvary.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.199
I didn't force you do that.

07:14.201 --> 07:18.837
I know. And I'm glad we did.

07:18.839 --> 07:21.673
Hey, but right now,
my biggest story

07:21.675 --> 07:24.709
in my little corner of the paper is
onetime "Memphis Man of the Year"

07:24.711 --> 07:28.079
just died trying
to kill a pastor.

07:28.081 --> 07:31.149
And you just want my story?

07:31.151 --> 07:33.218
No!

07:33.220 --> 07:35.687
My editor wants the story.

07:38.559 --> 07:42.194
But you won't go on record,
and I accept that.

07:42.196 --> 07:45.030
Guess this is what happens when
you don't go to church on Sunday?

07:45.032 --> 07:48.567
Nothing's happening.

07:50.571 --> 07:52.237
You let me know
if something does?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.707
You'll be the first one to hear.

07:58.579 --> 08:00.245
Thank you for the sleepover.

08:00.247 --> 08:01.913
Anytime.

08:08.188 --> 08:09.988
How you doing, my man?

08:09.990 --> 08:11.590
- Thanks for coming.
- Morning.

08:11.592 --> 08:14.893
All right. Bless you.
How you doing, little sister?

08:14.895 --> 08:16.161
What you doing here, son?

08:16.163 --> 08:19.197
Just, you know, doing what I can

08:19.199 --> 08:22.567
with what I got
for who wants to listen.

08:22.569 --> 08:25.537
- God bless you, man.
- You know, your mother's in a bad way, son.

08:25.539 --> 08:27.172
She just lost her brother.

08:27.174 --> 08:29.774
I don't care much to talk
about Mac right now.

08:29.776 --> 08:32.943
Well, then, be there for her.

08:32.946 --> 08:35.647
Pop, I promised her
I'd come by the house

08:35.649 --> 08:36.948
and watch her scatter his ashes,

08:36.950 --> 08:38.683
but I'm not gonna stop
living my life.

08:41.621 --> 08:43.255
This is your brandnew
master plan?

08:43.256 --> 08:48.126
God bless you, sister.
Not mine. The Lord's.

08:48.128 --> 08:49.928
You told me you didn't need me.
Hey, Grandpa.

08:49.930 --> 08:53.798
- You didn't want a copastor.
- Hey! Zora.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.600
Come here.

08:57.971 --> 09:00.906
There you go, all right.
God bless you. Hey, Mom.

09:00.908 --> 09:02.941
Hey, son.

09:02.943 --> 09:04.776
Did the two of you
learn anything

09:04.778 --> 09:07.212
from your season
with Basie Skanks?

09:07.214 --> 09:08.813
Jacob's not Basie.

09:08.815 --> 09:13.218
That's right,
and real church ain't Triumph.

09:13.220 --> 09:15.687
<i>- Real</i> church?
- Yes, sir.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.255
The Real Church of Memphis.

09:17.257 --> 09:19.925
A church not made with hands.
No walls.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.860
No stained glass windows.

09:21.862 --> 09:25.063
Just the people
and the Word of God.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.264
Amen.

09:26.266 --> 09:29.234
There you go, brother.
God bless you.

09:29.236 --> 09:31.002
You know, none of this has to do

09:31.004 --> 09:33.071
with the two of you, right?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.040
We're a family always.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.975
- I know, Grandpa.
- I know, Grandpa.

09:38.845 --> 09:40.579
Can I share my grandchildren?

09:44.318 --> 09:47.285
You know, your mother didn't
just lost a brother.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.821
She lost her father.
Almost lost your sister.

09:49.823 --> 09:51.222
I know!

09:51.224 --> 09:55.594
What you don't know
is how deep this goes, Jeb.

09:55.596 --> 09:56.828
Trust me, you don't.

09:58.932 --> 10:02.033
You're gonna regret this,
walking in the footsteps

10:02.035 --> 10:05.704
of Basie Skanks
all the way to hell.

10:05.706 --> 10:07.238
You should get back.

10:07.240 --> 10:09.975
Pastor. Come on.

10:12.613 --> 10:13.979
What was all that about Lady Mae

10:13.981 --> 10:15.880
and going
"deeper than you know"?

10:18.352 --> 10:23.788
Who knows.

10:23.790 --> 10:25.824
Hey, man, come on,
why don't you hop up here?

10:28.695 --> 10:32.397
Now, this one
is human love, caritas.

10:32.399 --> 10:34.232
Try and blow it out.

10:36.403 --> 10:40.872
Sad but true.
But now try this one.

10:42.309 --> 10:46.044
This one is agape.
That means God's love.

10:52.753 --> 10:54.285
Here, maybe if both of us blow.

10:54.287 --> 10:55.720
Yeah.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.698
Have you heard from Kevin
by any chance?

11:06.700 --> 11:07.799
No.

11:07.801 --> 11:09.367
Not a phone call,
email, nothing?

11:09.369 --> 11:13.104
- Nothing since the letter.
- How does a person do that?

11:13.106 --> 11:15.173
Just release themselves
from every tie

11:15.175 --> 11:16.274
that binds them?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.842
He must think it's his right.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.210
I could not imagine feeling

11:19.212 --> 11:21.212
that kind of license
to just desert people.

11:21.214 --> 11:24.015
Mama, why are you asking me
about Kevin?

11:24.017 --> 11:26.951
Well, don't worry.
I'll handle it.

11:26.953 --> 11:29.320
I can try him again,
if you want.

11:29.322 --> 11:31.723
There's no need.

11:31.725 --> 11:34.325
There's no need to reopen
that wound if you've closed it.

11:34.327 --> 11:36.895
I just thought that
if you'd heard from him.

11:36.897 --> 11:41.933
I haven't. I'm sorry.

11:41.935 --> 11:45.403
You know that by asking you
to go with me and your father

11:45.405 --> 11:47.372
to scatter Mac's ashes
that I am saying that...

11:47.374 --> 11:52.110
I know. I know.

11:52.112 --> 11:53.845
You don't have to explain.

11:56.149 --> 11:57.348
What a gift you are.

11:59.386 --> 12:03.088
- Okay, you're all set up.
- All right.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.927
We all lose sight of this fact

12:08.929 --> 12:12.831
because we slip into
this achievement brain.

12:12.833 --> 12:14.766
But God loves you
just the way you are.

12:14.768 --> 12:17.235
All right, ooh, look.
What do you think?

12:17.237 --> 12:19.003
Looking good, Daddy!

12:19.005 --> 12:23.174
Thank you. Thank you.
Your sister's the one.

12:23.176 --> 12:26.044
Just the way we are.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.747
<i>Not the way we'll be tomorrow.</i>

12:28.749 --> 12:31.983
<i>Not the way we were
before it all went wrong.</i>

12:31.985 --> 12:34.018
Right now!

12:34.020 --> 12:38.089
Right now. Just the way we are.

12:38.091 --> 12:39.791
We need get you on TV.

12:39.793 --> 12:42.527
I don't know.

12:42.529 --> 12:44.062
I think we're doing
something right,

12:44.064 --> 12:47.398
just keeping things small.

12:47.400 --> 12:51.770
I know. I'm just proud of you.

12:51.772 --> 12:55.306
Thanks, sweetheart.
Thank you, too, kiddo.

12:55.308 --> 12:56.474
No problem.

13:01.882 --> 13:04.282
<i>This is Kevin. Leave a message.</i>

13:04.284 --> 13:08.019
Hey, it's me.

13:08.021 --> 13:11.189
The person you used
to call your best friend.

13:11.191 --> 13:14.492
Your wife before you stopped
being a husband.

13:14.494 --> 13:18.096
The mother of your son, Nathan.

13:20.867 --> 13:23.935
I'm handling everything
that you left behind.

13:23.937 --> 13:26.971
This isn't right, Kevin,
what you're doing,

13:26.973 --> 13:29.841
just disappearing like this.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.378
It's not right.

13:46.827 --> 13:48.359
<i>Yo!</i>

13:50.230 --> 13:52.030
That's better than the last one.

13:52.032 --> 13:54.299
Whatever.

13:54.301 --> 13:55.967
It's okay, bud.

13:55.969 --> 14:00.138
So?

14:00.140 --> 14:01.906
Where'd you meet this guy?

14:01.908 --> 14:03.608
His mom teaches at Rhodes.

14:03.610 --> 14:05.577
So, we've been friends,
like, forever.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.446
So, what do you think?
He's cute, right?

14:08.448 --> 14:11.616
He's all right. A demiDenzel.

14:11.618 --> 14:13.251
He's gonna be the aide
to Representative Cohen

14:13.253 --> 14:16.321
this summer in Washington.

14:16.323 --> 14:21.926
- That's big.
- Ooh, nothing gets me going like civics.

14:21.928 --> 14:24.963
At least he's nice.

14:31.238 --> 14:35.039
Nice! And the men take
a decisive lead.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.208
Help me, Obiwan Kenobi.

14:37.210 --> 14:40.645
Hey, may I show you a trick?

14:40.647 --> 14:43.047
What, you guys afraid to lose?

14:43.049 --> 14:45.984
I just have this cool thing that
I hold the ball a certain way...

14:45.986 --> 14:48.920
Yeah, you hold
your balls your way.

14:48.922 --> 14:52.891
I'll hold mine, mine.
Okay? Different strokes.

14:58.198 --> 14:59.198
Isaiah?

15:00.500 --> 15:02.033
Yep.

15:02.035 --> 15:03.334
Doesn't know when to quit.

15:03.336 --> 15:05.403
Some call it a virtue.

15:12.045 --> 15:13.411
We need a turkey to win.

15:14.514 --> 15:16.447
Think you got that already.

15:20.120 --> 15:24.255
Yo.

15:29.596 --> 15:31.129
Come in!

15:31.131 --> 15:33.932
- Hey, bad time for a visit?
- Hey.

15:33.934 --> 15:35.199
No, no, not at all, come on in.

15:35.201 --> 15:37.635
- Is it okay if...
- Yes, please, sit down.

15:41.508 --> 15:43.408
He's not sleepy yet?

15:43.410 --> 15:45.243
He was,
but I was working on a song,

15:45.245 --> 15:47.712
and I got a little loud,
so it's my fault.

15:47.714 --> 15:49.047
How can I help?

15:51.718 --> 15:53.217
I want to find Kevin.

15:53.219 --> 15:54.519
Okay.

15:54.521 --> 15:56.421
Is there anything
that you can do?

15:56.423 --> 15:58.623
My parents are running
into all kinds of problems

15:58.625 --> 16:01.092
- since he left.
- No, it's,

16:01.094 --> 16:05.363
it's not cool that he just left
everything hanging like that.

16:05.365 --> 16:08.700
Especially you two.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.435
Yeah.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.203
Really.

16:12.205 --> 16:14.405
So, can you do some looking?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.441
Do you have
any contacts like that?

16:16.443 --> 16:18.476
I'll ask around tomorrow.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.544
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

16:27.253 --> 16:29.220
Don't go offroad
this time, okay?

16:29.222 --> 16:32.090
I'll see you tomorrow, crazy.

16:32.092 --> 16:33.591
It was nice to meet you, Zora.

16:33.593 --> 16:35.226
Yeah, you too.

16:39.632 --> 16:41.432
See you at mock trial.

16:45.538 --> 16:49.173
- That was fun.
- Did you tell Roberto about Isaiah?

16:49.175 --> 16:50.641
About him? What about him?

16:50.643 --> 16:52.176
What happened at the studio.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.678
- Why?
- So you did tell him.

16:53.680 --> 16:57.382
- Yeah, it happened.
- Why would you tell him?

16:57.384 --> 16:59.117
He's my boyfriend.

16:59.119 --> 17:03.187
You don't sell out your cousin
for chemistry notes.

17:03.189 --> 17:06.023
And then you want me
to mate with him?

17:06.026 --> 17:08.259
Mating wasn't
a part of the plan.

17:08.261 --> 17:12.230
Of course not. You know, 'cause
mating's for cool people, right?

17:16.803 --> 17:18.803
So, she explained the job?

17:18.805 --> 17:20.805
<i>Yeah, I just got off
the phone with her.</i>

17:20.807 --> 17:25.042
<i>- Talked for about two hours.</i>
- And you're gonna take it?

17:26.046 --> 17:27.078
What do you think?

17:28.615 --> 17:31.082
I think you should take it
if you want to.

17:33.119 --> 17:34.118
Well, you could come visit.

17:34.120 --> 17:37.555
Yeah.

17:37.557 --> 17:40.291
<i>I mean, weren't you on your way to
New York anyway when this all...</i>

17:40.293 --> 17:41.626
Yeah, yeah, I was.

17:41.628 --> 17:45.163
Yeah, so you could plausibly
end up there

17:45.165 --> 17:46.831
after Sophia graduates.

17:48.468 --> 17:50.735
Anything can happen.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.070
We can try
the longdistance thing,

17:52.072 --> 17:53.237
see how that goes.

17:55.375 --> 17:57.375
I think we know how that goes.

17:57.377 --> 17:59.343
This is how that goes.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.479
Yeah.

18:01.481 --> 18:03.214
Let's just talk tomorrow, okay?

18:03.216 --> 18:05.316
We can talk more now
if you want.

18:05.318 --> 18:06.417
<i>No, you know,</i>

18:06.419 --> 18:09.087
let's just talk tomorrow.

18:09.089 --> 18:13.825
Okay. Bye.

18:13.827 --> 18:15.259
Bye.

18:27.540 --> 18:30.808
It's gonna be
a sevenpart series.-

18:30.810 --> 18:33.111
"From the Pit To the Palace."

18:33.113 --> 18:34.812
It came to me all at once
in a dream.

18:34.814 --> 18:37.281
Yeah, yeah, I can't wait to
hear what you do with it.

18:37.283 --> 18:39.350
Because some
of these younger pastors,

18:39.352 --> 18:41.385
in my opinion,
use Joseph all wrong,

18:41.387 --> 18:42.887
you know, "Be yourself."

18:42.889 --> 18:46.357
Well, it's gonna be
deeper than that.

18:46.359 --> 18:49.293
When it's all said and done,
it may end up being a book.

18:49.295 --> 18:51.395
I would love it
if you did another book.

18:51.397 --> 18:54.398
Do you know I still turn
to the last one for wisdom?

18:54.400 --> 18:58.336
And what corners of the world

18:58.338 --> 19:00.438
are you lighting up
this morning?

19:00.440 --> 19:04.275
Well, I'm gonna set everything
straight with that van contract

19:04.277 --> 19:05.543
and then just go through resumes

19:05.545 --> 19:08.312
and try and find
a new outreach director.

19:08.314 --> 19:10.448
Will you join me for lunch?

19:10.450 --> 19:12.216
Been a while
since we stepped out.

19:12.218 --> 19:14.485
That would be lovely.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.889
What a pleasure it is to have
you as a partner in this life.

19:17.891 --> 19:21.392
You did get some sleep.

19:21.394 --> 19:22.827
I feel like a new man.

19:27.333 --> 19:29.834
- Karine?
- Good morning, Bishop.

19:29.836 --> 19:31.836
Did that check
for $10K clear yet?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.504
Just a few minutes ago.

19:33.506 --> 19:35.606
Praise God, I knew it would!

19:35.608 --> 19:40.912
Things are looking up, Karine.
Things are looking up.

19:40.914 --> 19:43.214
The contact info's on your desk.

19:43.216 --> 19:44.549
Thank you.

19:51.257 --> 19:52.657
Good morning.

19:52.659 --> 19:54.825
May I speak
to Ms. Rochelle Cross, please?

20:12.212 --> 20:13.311
Okay.

20:17.984 --> 20:22.620
No, I promise
it won't happen again.

20:22.622 --> 20:23.821
<i>No.</i>

20:23.823 --> 20:27.291
Yeah, well, thank you, Domita.

20:27.293 --> 20:29.894
All right, byebye.

20:29.896 --> 20:33.931
What's the matter?

20:36.369 --> 20:39.470
What if we made this luncheon
of ours a threesome?

20:39.472 --> 20:41.739
Well, with whom?

20:43.243 --> 20:44.609
Mac's ashes were just delivered.

20:44.611 --> 20:46.844
I just don't think
I'm in a place

20:46.846 --> 20:48.412
to be social right now.

20:48.414 --> 20:51.816
- Understood.
- Well, who were you thinking?

20:51.818 --> 20:55.987
The woman who wrote
the check, Rochelle Cross.-

20:55.989 --> 20:57.788
- She's free today.
- So go.

20:57.790 --> 21:00.458
Look, it can wait.

21:00.460 --> 21:03.327
It would be so much better
is you were there anyway.

21:03.329 --> 21:05.863
No, James, please go.

21:05.865 --> 21:10.701
Listen... if that check
cleared, go.

21:10.703 --> 21:12.603
We can do it another time.

21:12.605 --> 21:17.708
There will be
many, many times. Go.

21:21.748 --> 21:23.281
As directed.

21:30.423 --> 21:32.356
<i>- This is Kevin.
- Leave a message.</i>

21:33.726 --> 21:36.560
Hey, Kevin, it's me, Aaron.

21:36.562 --> 21:39.297
Look, Charity's looking
for you, man.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.998
She wants to hire a PI.

21:41.000 --> 21:44.769
I don't quite know
what to do here.

21:44.771 --> 21:47.938
Look, whatever you're feeling,

21:47.940 --> 21:50.675
whatever you're going through,
I get.

21:50.677 --> 21:52.810
I've been down the same road.

21:52.812 --> 21:57.081
Look, anyways, just give
me a call if you wanna.

21:57.083 --> 22:01.419
And if you don't want me to tell
anybody where you are, that's cool.

22:07.360 --> 22:09.427
Yes, well, whatever you can do

22:09.429 --> 22:12.730
to cover what Kevin left hanging

22:12.732 --> 22:14.432
until your mother
finds a replacement.

22:14.434 --> 22:17.601
Sure, yeah, whatever you need.

22:17.603 --> 22:22.373
And I'm sure if you stop by
her office and offer to help.

22:22.375 --> 22:24.508
With all that Jacob's up to
across the street.

22:24.510 --> 22:25.876
What's he doing
across the street?

22:25.878 --> 22:29.113
That's right, you weren't

22:29.115 --> 22:30.581
in church yesterday.

22:30.583 --> 22:31.882
You skipped church.

22:31.884 --> 22:33.351
What, you think
we weren't gonna notice?

22:33.353 --> 22:34.952
What's he doing
over there, Daddy?

22:34.954 --> 22:37.521
He's preaching in that lot

22:37.523 --> 22:40.424
like some
kind of Beale Street busker.

22:40.426 --> 22:43.561
Handing out bread and...

22:43.563 --> 22:45.096
God bless him.

22:45.098 --> 22:49.100
The point is...

22:49.102 --> 22:51.502
your mother needs you
more than ever now.

22:51.504 --> 22:53.738
Wants you.

22:53.740 --> 22:55.706
I trying to believe
that's true, Daddy.

22:55.708 --> 23:00.144
The virgin birth,

23:00.146 --> 23:05.383
the resurrection,
the trinity... all true.

23:06.853 --> 23:12.656
God's world is full
of unbelievable truths.

23:17.029 --> 23:19.530
And the steadiness
of your mother's love,

23:19.532 --> 23:22.466
despite all you two
have been through,

23:22.468 --> 23:24.568
may be the strongest one of all.

23:44.724 --> 23:47.425
- Here you are.
- Thank you, Lisa.

23:47.427 --> 23:51.061
- You must be Ms. Cross.
- I am.

23:51.063 --> 23:55.533
- Nice to meet you.
- Same here.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.168
Thanks for taking the time.

23:57.170 --> 23:59.570
My pleasure.

23:59.572 --> 24:02.540
And Lady Mae,
she couldn't make it?

24:02.542 --> 24:05.476
No, she was otherwise engaged.

24:05.478 --> 24:09.814
Well.
I guess we'll have to make do.

24:09.816 --> 24:14.685
- Well, I hope you're hungry.
- Starving.

24:17.957 --> 24:20.157
- Sister, sister.
- Hey.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.092
Hey. How are you?

24:22.094 --> 24:23.994
I'm good. Good.
What are you doing tonight?

24:23.996 --> 24:27.031
Changing diapers
and watching TV.

24:27.033 --> 24:28.566
Glamorous!

24:29.569 --> 24:31.569
That's my life.

24:31.571 --> 24:33.938
- Can you get a sitter?
- Why?

24:33.940 --> 24:35.172
Well, I'm going over to Jacob's,

24:35.174 --> 24:36.707
and I wanted to see
if you wanted to come.

24:36.709 --> 24:40.911
Just for fun?

24:40.913 --> 24:43.581
Yeah, and I kind of wanted
to see

24:43.583 --> 24:46.116
where his head
is at going forward.

24:46.118 --> 24:48.552
- You heard about him preaching.
- I did.

24:48.554 --> 24:50.554
You know, with Basie,
it was one thing.

24:50.556 --> 24:52.590
He wanted to prove
something to Daddy,

24:52.592 --> 24:56.627
but to see Jacob out there persisting
right in front of Calvary?

24:56.629 --> 24:58.829
Yeah, that's exactly why
I want to talk to him.

24:58.831 --> 25:00.564
Just figure it all out.

25:00.566 --> 25:03.534
Okay, I'll see
if Maricel can sit.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.936
Good, good, good.
This'll be fun.

25:05.938 --> 25:08.172
- Thank you, sister.
- Thank you.

25:08.174 --> 25:11.942
- Come here. Mwah. Have a good day.
- It will. You too.

25:11.944 --> 25:16.180
You know, in the five years
that we were married,

25:16.182 --> 25:18.682
I never went to church.

25:18.684 --> 25:20.718
That's why I felt the need
to write the check.

25:20.720 --> 25:25.723
Well, on behalf of Jesus
and His friends at Calvary,

25:25.725 --> 25:27.691
welcome back.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.661
Well, thank you.
It feels good to be back.

25:30.663 --> 25:34.865
Especially at a church
with such a dynamic preacher.

25:34.867 --> 25:38.636
Well, I...
I do my best as I'm able.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.205
You see so many of these...

25:41.207 --> 25:43.240
"teaching" preachers nowadays.

25:43.242 --> 25:47.011
They're in such a rush
to make sense of everything.

25:47.013 --> 25:49.613
When I saw you up there,
brought me right back

25:49.615 --> 25:52.716
to Gethsemane
Baptist Church, 1990.

25:54.654 --> 25:57.788
I felt like a little girl again.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.892
Well, I'll take that
as a compliment.

26:01.894 --> 26:04.762
But of course, um...

26:04.764 --> 26:08.666
I always try to keep my drama
in the service of the gospel

26:08.668 --> 26:12.136
so as to not, you know,
glorify myself in any way.

26:12.138 --> 26:13.737
No, no, no, no, no.

26:13.739 --> 26:16.740
Your sincerity shines
right through, like lightning.

26:16.742 --> 26:20.244
Well, I thank you, Ms. Cross.

26:20.246 --> 26:22.713
You can call me Rochelle.

26:22.715 --> 26:27.351
Of course. Well, Rochelle?

26:28.921 --> 26:32.089
Typically donations
the size of yours

26:32.091 --> 26:35.593
are rewarded with membership
in what we call

26:35.595 --> 26:36.860
the Bishop's Round Table.

26:36.862 --> 26:38.162
No, no, no.

26:38.164 --> 26:40.998
Now, members
get periodic opportunities

26:41.000 --> 26:46.837
to use the church's jet for,
well, missions, of course.

26:46.839 --> 26:48.973
Bishop Greenleaf?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.641
Yes?

26:50.643 --> 26:52.643
This round table?

26:52.645 --> 26:55.312
The one
we're sitting at right now?

26:55.314 --> 26:57.214
That's the only
Bishop's round table

26:57.216 --> 26:58.949
that I'm interested in.

27:01.120 --> 27:03.887
Understood.

27:03.889 --> 27:07.791
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I'm going to the ladies' room.

27:22.675 --> 27:26.010
Excuse me. Check, please.

27:29.882 --> 27:31.849
Guys, thank you so much
for bringing this food.

27:31.851 --> 27:34.284
I have been in the kitchen
so much lately.

27:34.286 --> 27:35.653
No, that's the least we can do.

27:35.655 --> 27:36.754
Thanks for having us over.

27:36.756 --> 27:37.855
- Yeah.
- This is nice.

27:39.759 --> 27:45.195
And how are you, Grace?
Are you talking to someone?

27:45.197 --> 27:47.665
I'm fine.

27:47.667 --> 27:48.899
Jacob and I
went to see a therapist

27:48.901 --> 27:50.434
when we were having trouble,
and it helped.

27:50.436 --> 27:52.670
I'm not having any trouble.

27:52.672 --> 27:56.340
There's no shame in it, Grace.

27:56.342 --> 27:57.908
Unless you think there is.

27:57.910 --> 27:59.276
No, I don't think
there's any shame in it.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.978
I just don't need help.

28:04.150 --> 28:07.084
So, how's Nashville, peanut?

28:07.086 --> 28:09.186
- Really good, actually.
- <i>-Yeah?</i>

28:09.188 --> 28:12.456
Now, are we gonna be hearing
something on Hallelujah FM

28:12.458 --> 28:13.924
with your hand on it?

28:15.861 --> 28:17.995
I don't know about that,
but I did place

28:17.997 --> 28:19.997
a couple songs
on some records, so...

28:19.999 --> 28:21.398
Well, I think we're all
really proud of the way

28:21.400 --> 28:22.866
you've been putting
yourself out there.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.102
Amen to that. Way to go, sissy.

28:25.104 --> 28:26.737
- Thank you.
- I'm really proud of you.

28:26.739 --> 28:28.105
Thank you,
that means a lot, guys.

28:28.107 --> 28:29.373
It's definitely been a blessing

28:29.375 --> 28:34.178
to have this distraction
with Kevin and...

28:34.180 --> 28:37.214
the baby... everything else.

28:37.216 --> 28:39.483
It's just... it's been good.

28:43.322 --> 28:46.156
So, did Kevin just...

28:49.261 --> 28:51.995
Seems like it, yeah..
Well, that is such a mess.

28:51.997 --> 28:55.299
You guys just seemed like
the perfect couple to me.

28:55.301 --> 28:57.935
You were friends.

28:57.937 --> 29:01.038
Okay, grown folk talk.
I get it. I'll leave.

29:01.040 --> 29:04.041
<i>See you later on, sweetheart.</i>
Bye, baby.

29:04.043 --> 29:08.345
If you don't mind my asking,
why did you two break up?

29:08.347 --> 29:10.414
Yeah, like, what was the deal?

29:10.416 --> 29:12.850
I mean, I kind of miss
my little brother.

29:14.854 --> 29:18.355
Kevin's gay.

29:20.760 --> 29:25.162
- He's what?
- Kevin's gay.

29:28.234 --> 29:30.200
What's so funny?

29:30.202 --> 29:33.237
Nothing, I... that's...

29:33.239 --> 29:36.406
that's just the first time
I've said it like that..

29:38.043 --> 29:42.045
Kevin's gay.

29:42.047 --> 29:46.049
- It's... it's awful!
- Yes.

29:46.051 --> 29:47.918
It's absolutely awful.

29:47.920 --> 29:49.820
It must be.

29:49.822 --> 29:51.455
Did you know that?

29:51.457 --> 29:53.891
Yeah, that's...
That's what that is.

29:53.893 --> 29:55.893
I seriously doubt that.
That can't...

29:55.895 --> 29:59.496
This is not funny. Her whole world
has been turned upside down by this.

29:59.498 --> 30:03.000
It's true. I'm so unhappy!

30:04.970 --> 30:07.104
You people are crazy!

30:08.307 --> 30:11.875
Hey.

30:11.877 --> 30:13.510
Hi.

30:15.181 --> 30:17.915
How was lunch
with that big donor? Ms...

30:17.917 --> 30:19.016
- Cross? Yes.
- Cross, yes.

30:19.018 --> 30:21.385
Uneventful.

30:21.387 --> 30:25.022
Well, is she gonna join?

30:25.024 --> 30:26.824
Not yet.

30:26.826 --> 30:28.158
Then why
did she write that check?

30:30.396 --> 30:32.830
To settle a debt with the Lord.

30:32.832 --> 30:37.367
That's how she put it, anyway.

30:37.369 --> 30:39.102
She coming to church on Sunday?

30:39.104 --> 30:41.138
I think she might, yes.

30:41.140 --> 30:44.975
I look forward to meeting her.

30:44.977 --> 30:49.179
Would you like a piece
of pound cake?

30:49.181 --> 30:53.851
No, thank you.

30:53.853 --> 30:57.221
I am just waiting for the Lord

30:57.223 --> 31:00.991
to guide me to the right
scripture for Saturday.

31:00.993 --> 31:05.362
Okay. Can I make you
a suggestion?

31:09.134 --> 31:13.203
I just to need to sit
with it for a while.

31:13.205 --> 31:14.205
All right.

31:17.343 --> 31:19.276
Thank you.

31:25.885 --> 31:28.352
I just don't understand
why he couldn't be gay

31:28.354 --> 31:30.053
and divorced and across town.

31:30.055 --> 31:31.955
People do that.

31:31.957 --> 31:36.393
They do, but he doesn't
really want to be gay.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.362
I mean, he's finally
admitted to it,

31:38.364 --> 31:40.664
but he still doesn't want to be.

31:40.666 --> 31:43.400
Well, look, I don't blame him.
That's hard.

31:43.402 --> 31:45.903
- I mean, that's a hard life.
- It sure is.

31:45.905 --> 31:48.438
Yeah. Well, whatever help
you need with Nathan

31:48.440 --> 31:50.474
when you're going
back and forth to Nashville,

31:50.476 --> 31:53.377
- we're here, know that.
- Thank you.

31:53.379 --> 31:56.213
Thank you.
That means a lot, Kerissa.

31:56.215 --> 32:00.017
So, what made you two decide
to come over

32:00.019 --> 32:02.986
after all this time?

32:02.988 --> 32:06.490
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I appreciate it. It's cool.

32:06.492 --> 32:09.426
Well, I did kind of want
to get a sense

32:09.428 --> 32:11.228
of how committed you are

32:11.230 --> 32:13.363
to this street corner preaching.

32:13.365 --> 32:15.198
<i>On that particular corner.</i>

32:15.200 --> 32:18.168
I told you it wasn't social.

32:18.170 --> 32:21.104
You have to admit,
it's a little odd.

32:21.106 --> 32:24.241
I told you.

32:24.243 --> 32:26.677
Are you actually gonna sit here
and disallow your brother

32:26.679 --> 32:28.245
from preaching the gospel?

32:28.247 --> 32:30.180
No, of cour...

32:30.182 --> 32:33.083
But does he have to do it
across the street?

32:33.085 --> 32:35.319
It was crazy idea
when Basie had it.

32:35.321 --> 32:37.688
Gigi, that land is all we have.

32:37.690 --> 32:39.289
Because you came back.

32:39.291 --> 32:40.724
I didn't make anybody leave.

32:40.726 --> 32:45.128
No, you made it
impossible to stay.

32:45.130 --> 32:46.964
- Hey.
- Jacob...

32:49.301 --> 32:51.101
Look...

32:52.571 --> 32:55.005
that land's all we got,

32:55.007 --> 32:59.076
and all I have is a message
that God finally gave me.

32:59.078 --> 33:01.511
What am I supposed to do?

33:01.513 --> 33:03.680
Take my job.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.350
If this is really about
ministering to the homeless,

33:06.352 --> 33:08.652
then Calvary already has
that infrastructure.

33:08.654 --> 33:10.454
Didn't Kevin have that program?

33:10.456 --> 33:13.323
But what would you do?

33:13.325 --> 33:14.491
What do you mean?

33:14.493 --> 33:17.594
Well, if Jacob
is the associate pastor,

33:17.596 --> 33:20.130
what would you do?

33:20.132 --> 33:22.466
That math isn't adding up, Gigi.

33:27.239 --> 33:28.605
Maybe move to New York.

33:28.607 --> 33:30.340
Come on, leave again?

33:30.342 --> 33:32.542
I'm not preaching.

33:32.544 --> 33:35.345
I don't seem to be able
to minister effectively.

33:35.347 --> 33:38.315
And people don't see things
quite the way I do,

33:38.317 --> 33:40.717
and really, the way that I see
them is changing all the time.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.187
So why not?
I'm just being honest.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.524
Jacob. Take my job.

33:56.301 --> 33:59.569
- Hey. I saw your tweet.
<i>- Which one?</i>

33:59.571 --> 34:04.074
The one you linked to my dad's
GoHelpMe page. Thank you.

34:04.076 --> 34:07.677
<i>I miss you, baby.</i>

34:07.679 --> 34:08.679
I miss you, too.

34:10.783 --> 34:13.417
No! I'm not going back there, Gigi.
Jacob.

34:13.418 --> 34:16.485
- Jacob,<i> why?</i>
- Because that's not what God asked me to do!

34:16.487 --> 34:19.356
Do you think
you're the only person

34:19.358 --> 34:22.426
that God calls
or doesn't call, talks to?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.293
<i>You're wrong.</i>

34:24.295 --> 34:25.429
No, I don't think that.

34:25.431 --> 34:26.830
Well, then what
was with that noise?

34:26.831 --> 34:28.632
We all know what
that noise means.

34:28.634 --> 34:30.634
It doesn't
mean anything, Kerissa.

34:30.636 --> 34:33.770
Look, Gigi, God doesn't want me
to preach on Sundays

34:33.772 --> 34:36.406
to pay the electric bill
or to sit with the deacons

34:36.408 --> 34:38.641
in the round table,
listen to their stories

34:38.643 --> 34:41.710
so they can pay
for upholstery or paint

34:41.713 --> 34:44.414
or whatever rehab
Mama's dreaming up.

34:44.416 --> 34:46.750
That's not what
Jesus said to do.

34:46.752 --> 34:47.818
That's not what I'm doing.

34:47.820 --> 34:50.219
Jacob, Daddy is sick!

34:50.222 --> 34:52.188
Charity is flying
all over creation...

34:52.190 --> 34:54.623
What? -...And, baby,
that's wonderful, all right?

34:54.626 --> 34:57.260
But she's raising Nathan
by herself.

34:57.262 --> 34:59.463
You can't
just desert the family.

34:59.465 --> 35:01.865
Like you?

35:01.867 --> 35:03.667
I was 18 years old.

35:03.669 --> 35:06.269
You don't know
what you're talking about.

35:06.271 --> 35:10.841
Jacob, someone
has to manage things.

35:10.843 --> 35:16.179
You know what, Gigi, you're right.
Somebody does.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.814
It's not gonna be me.

35:37.870 --> 35:40.337
She was just defending her man.

35:40.339 --> 35:41.605
I wasn't attacking him.

35:44.343 --> 35:45.542
Where you going?

35:45.544 --> 35:47.210
What do you care?

35:47.212 --> 35:49.446
Charity, come on,
would you wait? Wait!

35:49.448 --> 35:53.316
- What?
- Why are you so mad?

35:53.318 --> 35:55.385
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

35:55.387 --> 35:59.156
Grace, you're leaving again.

35:59.158 --> 36:01.858
I said I was
just thinking about it.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.793
Well, Jacob never
had that chance,

36:03.795 --> 36:05.729
the chance
to <i> think</i> about leaving.

36:05.731 --> 36:08.498
I never had it until now.
Only you, Gigi.

36:08.500 --> 36:10.934
You're the only one.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.336
Twenty years
you were gone, Gigi.

36:13.338 --> 36:16.339
And you wanna accuse Jacob
of deserting the family?

36:16.341 --> 36:17.841
What did you do?

36:17.843 --> 36:20.644
You left
and you never looked back,

36:20.646 --> 36:23.380
and we stayed here,
trying to fill up

36:23.382 --> 36:25.315
the space that you left behind

36:25.317 --> 36:27.517
and never being
good enough to do it.

36:27.519 --> 36:29.586
<i>Do we matter to you at all</i>

36:29.588 --> 36:32.389
or just Faith 'cause she's dead?

36:32.391 --> 36:34.791
Charity...

36:34.793 --> 36:36.259
I love you. Don't do that.

36:36.261 --> 36:39.529
Really? You love me?

36:39.531 --> 36:42.265
Gigi, we've been here.

36:42.267 --> 36:44.668
We put in our time.

36:44.670 --> 36:48.672
Sometimes when we wanted to,
a <i> lot</i> when we didn't,

36:48.674 --> 36:51.441
but always because
we are family.

36:51.443 --> 36:53.343
So, it's your turn now.

37:03.555 --> 37:07.591
- All right, go ahead. Refresh this bad boy.
- Okay.

37:07.593 --> 37:10.527
$3,100. That's not bad
for two days.

37:10.529 --> 37:11.761
That's what I'm talking about.

37:11.763 --> 37:14.297
Two days and a little help
from Isaiah.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.333
Now, how the Lord's
gonna grow this thing

37:16.335 --> 37:17.867
moving forward
remains to be seen.

37:17.869 --> 37:19.869
<i>If He does at all. We'll see.</i>

37:19.871 --> 37:22.606
Ooh, maybe you should buy
a mic and an amp.

37:22.608 --> 37:24.574
No, we're not buying anything.

37:24.576 --> 37:26.576
Well, then what's the money for?

37:26.578 --> 37:29.646
Food, for those
that come who need it.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.916
And, you know, a place to stay
for families that need help.

37:32.918 --> 37:36.286
- Clothes.
- And a church, eventually.

37:36.288 --> 37:39.789
Well, not unless the Lord
tells me to build one.

37:41.526 --> 37:43.660
Well, can I tell you something?

37:43.662 --> 37:46.563
- Promise not to tell anybody?
- Hit me.

37:46.565 --> 37:48.765
You're becoming a solid dude.

37:48.767 --> 37:50.767
Well, thank you, baby.

37:50.769 --> 37:52.569
'Cause that's all
I ever wanted to be.

38:00.545 --> 38:02.612
You can't leave, Aaron. No.

38:02.614 --> 38:04.714
This was always
a temporary thing.

38:04.716 --> 38:07.617
Well, so was the Garden of Eden.

38:07.619 --> 38:10.020
It's a part of God's plan
that plans change.

38:10.022 --> 38:12.489
- You're staying.
- Lady Mae...

38:12.491 --> 38:14.724
We need you here.
I need you here.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.427
As a stay
against all this confusion.

38:17.429 --> 38:19.829
Lady Mae, I have to go.

38:23.969 --> 38:28.672
Trust me, it...
I just have to go.

38:36.081 --> 38:37.814
You have to go.

38:41.787 --> 38:43.019
Amen.

38:50.429 --> 38:51.912
Would you...

38:51.913 --> 38:53.713
Would you give your father
my fondest regards?

39:19.124 --> 39:20.990
And then he was just gone.

39:24.463 --> 39:26.563
I didn't go over there
to kill him.

39:26.565 --> 39:28.465
I was just looking
for my daughter,

39:28.467 --> 39:29.999
and he tried to kill me.

39:36.408 --> 39:38.942
That's it.
That's the whole story.

39:38.944 --> 39:43.680
Well... thank you.

39:45.517 --> 39:50.553
So... write it, great,
don't write it, great.

39:50.555 --> 39:52.789
Just let me know so I can warn

39:52.791 --> 39:54.624
my parents and the deacon board.

39:54.626 --> 39:58.828
Of course. Yeah.

39:58.830 --> 40:01.097
And then...
can we do some dinner

40:01.099 --> 40:02.866
or something
before you leave town?

40:07.506 --> 40:09.072
I decided not to take the job.

40:11.810 --> 40:13.176
When?

40:13.178 --> 40:14.644
Couple days ago.

40:18.483 --> 40:19.816
Why didn't you take it?

40:27.559 --> 40:28.559
Really?

40:32.130 --> 40:33.696
Come here.

41:21.780 --> 41:23.513
I'm so glad you came, baby.
