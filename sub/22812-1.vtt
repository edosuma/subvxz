I RAN HIS PRINTS.

01:27:22.278 --> 01:27:24.280
HE DOES HAVE A RECORD.

01:27:24.280 --> 01:27:25.782
IT'S AN OLD ONE.

01:27:25.782 --> 01:27:29.786
PETTY THEFT,40 YEARS AGO.

01:27:29.827 --> 01:27:31.621
40 YEARS?

01:27:31.621 --> 01:27:33.373
THAT'S A LIFETIME.

01:27:33.414 --> 01:27:35.208
TURNS OUT,

01:27:35.250 --> 01:27:37.961
HE MET HIS WIFE

01:27:38.002 --> 01:27:40.672
AND HE GAVE UPHIS CRIMINAL LIFE.

01:27:40.713 --> 01:27:42.465
HE GOT A JOB,HE GOT MARRIED,

01:27:42.507 --> 01:27:45.134
AND, BY ALL ACCOUNTS,LED AN EXEMPLARY LIFE

01:27:45.176 --> 01:27:46.344
FOR THE NEXT FOURDECADES...

01:27:46.386 --> 01:27:47.470
HUH.

01:27:47.512 --> 01:27:49.806
UNTIL NOW.

01:27:49.806 --> 01:27:51.474
SHE DIED.

01:27:51.474 --> 01:27:52.475
HE FELT LOST.

01:27:52.475 --> 01:27:53.476
YEAH.

01:27:53.476 --> 01:27:54.435
I DON'T KNOW,

01:27:54.477 --> 01:27:56.187
MAYBE THE HOLIDAYSARE AFFECTING ME,

01:27:56.229 --> 01:27:58.147
BUT I DON'T KNOWWHAT TO DO.

01:27:58.189 --> 01:27:59.816
IT'S PROBABLY NOT MY CALL,

01:27:59.857 --> 01:28:02.610
BUT WHAT IF THISIS ALL A CRY FOR HELP?

01:28:04.737 --> 01:28:05.822
WHAT IFTHAT CONNECTION

01:28:05.863 --> 01:28:06.823
WITH OTHER PEOPLE

01:28:06.864 --> 01:28:08.950
IS WHAT HE'S ALWAYSBEEN LOOKING FOR?

01:28:11.077 --> 01:28:12.161
AND BESIDES,

01:28:12.161 --> 01:28:15.164
IS IT REALLY A CRIMEIF HE GAVE EVERYTHING BACK?

01:28:18.584 --> 01:28:22.213
I GOT A SECOND CHANCEON THIS TRAIN.

01:28:22.255 --> 01:28:24.215
MAYBEHE DESERVES ONE, TOO.

01:28:24.257 --> 01:28:26.175
AW.

01:28:30.638 --> 01:28:32.015
FADE IN.

01:28:32.056 --> 01:28:33.599
TRAIN STATION.

01:28:33.641 --> 01:28:35.351
THE CAMERA FOLLOWS A WOMAN.

01:28:35.351 --> 01:28:37.687
HESITANT, SHE BOARDS THE TRAIN,

01:28:37.687 --> 01:28:38.938
NOT YET KNOWING

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.690
THIS TRIP WOULD TAKE HER THROUGH THE RUGGED TERRAIN

01:28:40.732 --> 01:28:43.234
OF HER OWN HEART...

01:28:52.243 --> 01:28:53.786
YOU DON'T TAKE THE CHRISTMAS TRAIN

01:28:53.828 --> 01:28:56.748
TO GET SOMEWHERE FAST.

01:28:56.789 --> 01:28:59.292
YOU TAKE IT FOR THE JOURNEY...

01:29:00.668 --> 01:29:02.045
AND WHAT A JOURNEY IT IS,

01:29:02.045 --> 01:29:04.714
BECAUSE WITH EVERY STOP IT MAKES,

01:29:04.756 --> 01:29:08.718
A LITTLE BIT OF AMERICA GETS ON AND SAYS "HELLO,"

01:29:08.718 --> 01:29:12.889
AND SOMETIMES EVEN "MERRY CHRISTMAS."

01:29:12.930 --> 01:29:14.223
PEOPLE DON'T RUSH,

01:29:14.223 --> 01:29:16.893
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT WHAT TRAINS ARE FOR.

01:29:16.893 --> 01:29:19.979
THEY'RE NOT JUST ABOUT THE DESTINATION.

01:29:20.021 --> 01:29:23.483
THEY'RE ABOUT THE JOY OF TAKING THE TRIP.

01:29:27.070 --> 01:29:30.073
[♪♪]

01:29:34.202 --> 01:29:35.286
I'M NOT SAYING

01:29:35.328 --> 01:29:38.331
THAT RIDING A TRAIN WILL CHANGE YOUR LIFE...

01:29:41.376 --> 01:29:44.128
BUT IT CERTAINLY CHANGED MINE.

01:29:52.929 --> 01:29:56.265
[♪♪]

01:30:06.818 --> 01:30:10.196
[♪♪]

01:30:19.038 --> 01:30:20.957
TOM?

01:30:20.957 --> 01:30:21.874
LISTEN, I, UH...

01:30:21.916 --> 01:30:23.960

HOW MUCH I APPRECIATEWHAT YOU'VE DONE.

01:30:28.339 --> 01:30:30.550
OH, I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

01:30:30.591 --> 01:30:31.551
OH, YOU DID,

01:30:31.592 --> 01:30:34.637

01:30:34.679 --> 01:30:36.389
AND I JUSTWANT YOU TO KNOW

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:40.309
THAT THIS JOURNEY HAS...IT'S CHANGED MY LIFE.

01:30:40.351 --> 01:30:41.352
WHEN I LOST RUTH,

01:30:41.394 --> 01:30:44.647
I THOUGHTTHAT I HAD NO PURPOSE

01:30:44.647 --> 01:30:47.817
LEFT IN THE WORLD,

01:30:47.859 --> 01:30:53.197
BUT I FOUND IT HERE AGAIN,ON THE CHRISTMAS TRAIN,

01:30:53.239 --> 01:30:56.492
AND NOW I WANT TO SHAREWHAT SHE TAUGHT ME

01:30:56.492 --> 01:30:57.493
WITH OTHERS.

01:30:57.535 --> 01:30:59.203
HE'S GOINGTO CHICAGO,

01:30:59.245 --> 01:31:00.997

01:31:01.038 --> 01:31:04.500
I THINK I CANCONTRIBUTE SOMETHING.

01:31:04.500 --> 01:31:07.170
OH, I KNOW YOU CAN.

01:31:07.170 --> 01:31:08.379

01:32:57.280 --> 01:32:59.657
APPARENTLY...

01:32:59.699 --> 01:33:02.451
MAX WROTE A SCRIPT?

01:33:02.451 --> 01:33:04.829
"MISTY:SOMETHING HAPPENED IN ISRAEL.

01:33:04.870 --> 01:33:07.873
YOU HAD EVERYTHING,BUT YOU RAN AWAY."

01:33:09.292 --> 01:33:10.793
"JULIE: HIS PARENTS

01:33:10.793 --> 01:33:11.919
"THINK I'M NOT GOOD ENOUGHFOR HIM

01:33:11.961 --> 01:33:14.297

01:33:14.297 --> 01:33:15.423

01:33:15.464 --> 01:33:18.467
"LELIA: I CAN SEETHIS IS A LOT TO THROW AT YOU.

01:33:18.467 --> 01:33:19.969
"TAKE YOUR TIMEAND THINK ABOUT IT.

01:33:20.011 --> 01:33:23.848
WE HAVE TWO DAYS TO L.A.,RIGHT?"

01:33:23.889 --> 01:33:25.182
SO THIS ENTIRE TRIP

01:33:25.224 --> 01:33:28.311
WAS A MAX POWERSPRODUCTION?

01:33:28.311 --> 01:33:30.479
I THOUGHT THIS WAS GOING TO BEA LOVE STORY ON A TRAIN,

01:33:30.479 --> 01:33:33.482
BUT NOW I'M THINKING MURDER.

01:33:42.867 --> 01:33:45.119
WAS EVERYONE ON THAT TRAINPART OF YOUR CAST?

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.374

01:33:57.006 --> 01:33:58.507

01:33:58.549 --> 01:34:01.344
I JUST PUT A FEW PIECESTOGETHER...

01:34:01.385 --> 01:34:04.764
I KNEW YOU HADYOUR ONE BIG LOVE.

01:34:04.805 --> 01:34:05.681
I DIDSOME DIGGING,

01:34:05.723 --> 01:34:06.724
AND WHEN I FOUND OUT

01:34:06.766 --> 01:34:10.186
THAT TOM WAS GOINGTO BE ON THE TRAIN,

01:34:10.186 --> 01:34:12.396
I THOUGHT,WHAT BETTER SETTING?

01:34:12.438 --> 01:34:13.522
A CAPTIVE AUDIENCE.

01:34:13.522 --> 01:34:17.526
AND THEN I BROUGHTSTEVE AND JULIE IN

01:34:17.526 --> 01:34:18.653
TO REMIND YOU TWO

01:34:18.694 --> 01:34:20.529

01:34:30.873 --> 01:34:34.043
AND THEN I WANTED A CHARACTERLIKE MISTY

BECAUSE I THOUGHT

01:34:35.461 --> 01:34:39.924
SHE MIGHT RESTOREYOUR BELIEF IN FATE.

01:34:39.965 --> 01:34:42.760
SO YOU DON'T ACTUALLY KNOWWHAT MY LUCKY DAY IS?

01:34:42.802 --> 01:34:45.513
I WOULD SAY THATTHAT'S TODAY.

01:34:46.847 --> 01:34:48.182

AND I BROUGHT LELIAON BOARD
