[NICKERS]

01:24.753 --> 01:28.047
MA! MR. TINKER'S HERE!

01:28.214 --> 01:30.341
[RATTLING]

01:39.058 --> 01:40.226
HI, TINKER.

01:40.393 --> 01:41.478
GOOD MORNING.

01:48.651 --> 01:50.445
HOW ARE YOU,
MR. JONES?

02:21.601 --> 02:22.769
Charles:
OH, YOU GOT IT, HUH?

02:22.936 --> 02:25.605
Caroline:
JUST BEAUTIFUL.

02:25.772 --> 02:28.399
[PATS BACK]
Charles: TINKER.

02:28.566 --> 02:30.318
HOW ARE YOU?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

02:30.485 --> 02:31.653
REAL CRAFTSMAN.

02:32.695 --> 02:35.698
Charles: REAL CRAFTSMAN.

02:35.865 --> 02:36.950
SO SHINY.

02:37.116 --> 02:38.785
YOU CAN USE IT
FOR A MIRROR.

02:45.458 --> 02:47.252
HA HA HA!
HA HA HA!

02:47.418 --> 02:49.963
HA HA HA!

02:50.129 --> 02:52.173
IT'S REALLY
VERY SPECIAL.

02:52.340 --> 02:53.925
WE THANK YOU.

02:54.092 --> 02:55.301
HOW MUCH
DO I OWE YOU?

03:12.235 --> 03:14.195
IT'S LESS THAN
THE MERCANTILE.

03:16.197 --> 03:17.657
AND SO MUCH NICER.

03:34.215 --> 03:35.925
LOOK AT THOSE.

03:36.092 --> 03:38.177
OH!

03:38.344 --> 03:40.346
ISN'T IT PRETTY?

03:40.513 --> 03:42.056
MINE'S PRETTIER'N YOURS.

03:43.808 --> 03:45.310
Mary:
THANK YOU, TINKER.

03:45.476 --> 03:46.561
Laura: THANKS.

04:03.077 --> 04:05.580
Charles:
OH, FOR CARRIE.

04:05.747 --> 04:06.539
LOOK AT THAT.

04:06.706 --> 04:07.874
ISN'T THAT PRETTY?

04:13.129 --> 04:14.213
MINE!

04:19.302 --> 04:21.471
TINKER?

04:21.638 --> 04:23.348
THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FROM ALL OF US.

04:23.514 --> 04:25.642
YOU'RE REALLY
VERY KIND.

04:25.808 --> 04:26.893
KIND.

04:38.821 --> 04:40.114
THANK YOU!

04:48.539 --> 04:49.999
IT'S TIME TO PUT
THOSE AWAY.

04:50.166 --> 04:51.542
YES. IT'S ALMOST
TIME FOR SUPPER.

04:51.709 --> 04:53.670
IT'S TIME FOR YOU
TO WASH YOUR HANDS.

04:53.836 --> 04:54.921
[CHUCKLES]

04:56.923 --> 04:57.757
THERE WE GO.

04:57.924 --> 04:59.217
WHERE DOES TINKER
COME FROM?

04:59.384 --> 05:01.803
I DON'T REALLY KNOW,
HALF-PINT.

05:01.970 --> 05:03.513
WHERE'S HIS FAMILY?

05:03.680 --> 05:06.224
WELL, I DON'T REALLY
THINK HE HAS ONE.

05:06.391 --> 05:09.560
THAT MUST BE AWFUL, NOT TO
HAVE ANYONE TO LOVE HIM

05:09.727 --> 05:11.270
LIKE WE HAVE YOU AND MA.

05:11.437 --> 05:12.397
WELL, HALF-PINT,

05:12.563 --> 05:14.857
I WOULDN'T FEEL SORRY
FOR TINKER.

05:15.024 --> 05:16.776
HE GETS A LOT OF PLEASURE
OUT OF MAKING THOSE TOYS

05:16.943 --> 05:19.070
FOR ALL THE BOYS
AND GIRLS.

05:19.237 --> 05:22.240
YOU KNOW, IN A WAY IT'S LIKE
YOU'RE ALL HIS CHILDREN.

05:22.407 --> 05:24.951
THE KIDS
ARE HIS FAMILY.

05:25.118 --> 05:26.244
THAT'S RIGHT.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.872
I WISH TINKER
COULD TALK,

05:30.039 --> 05:32.875
SO WE COULD KNOW FOR SURE
IF HE WAS HAPPY.

05:33.042 --> 05:34.669
I'M SURE HE IS.

05:34.836 --> 05:36.379
NOW, GO ON. TAKE
THOSE TOYS UPSTAIRS.

05:41.968 --> 05:44.470
You FORGOT To
[INDISTINCT].

05:44.637 --> 05:45.680
I DID?

05:45.847 --> 05:47.724
WELL, WE'LL TAKE CARE
OF THAT RIGHT NOW.

06:11.372 --> 06:13.666
ALMIGHTY GOD...

06:13.833 --> 06:16.586
WHO HAS BLESSED THE LAND THAT
IT SHOULD BE FRUITFUL...

06:16.753 --> 06:18.880
[SNORING]

06:19.047 --> 06:22.759
AND BRING FORTH WHATSOEVER IS
NEEDFUL FOR THE LIFE OF MAN.

06:25.386 --> 06:30.850
AND HAS COMMANDED US THAT
WE WORK WITH QUIETNESS...

06:31.017 --> 06:32.351
AND EAT OUR OWN BREAD...

06:34.854 --> 06:36.647
EVEN THOUGH
WE HAVE SINNED.

06:44.655 --> 06:46.491
BLESS THE LABORS
OF THE HUSBANDMAN...

06:49.118 --> 06:52.622
AND GRANT US
SUCH SEASONAL WEATHER

06:52.789 --> 06:56.876
AS WE MAY GATHER IN
THE FRUITS OF THE EARTH.

06:57.043 --> 07:00.463
AND EVER REJOICE
IN THY GOODNESS...

07:00.630 --> 07:03.132
TO THE PRAISE
OF THY HOLY NAME.

07:03.299 --> 07:04.509
AMEN.

07:04.675 --> 07:06.552
All: AMEN.

07:06.719 --> 07:08.888
THUS ENDETH THE PRAYER

07:09.055 --> 07:11.015
AND THE SERVICE
FOR TODAY.

07:11.182 --> 07:15.728
NOW IF THE CHILDREN WOULD FOLLOW MRS.
KENNEDY OUTSIDE FOR SUNDAY SCHOOL,

07:15.895 --> 07:18.022
I SHOULD LIKE
TO SPEAK TO YOU BRIEFLY

07:18.189 --> 07:21.317
ABOUT A SUBJECT THAT IS
VERY NEAR TO MY HEART.

07:34.455 --> 07:37.750
IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HERE
IN WALNUT GROVE...

07:37.917 --> 07:39.460
AMONG MY FRIENDS,

07:39.627 --> 07:40.878
WHOM I'VE REALLY
COME TO CHERISH

07:41.045 --> 07:43.131
DURING THESE
MONTHLY VISITS.

07:43.297 --> 07:45.967
MY, HOW
THIS COMMUNITY'S GROWN.

07:46.134 --> 07:50.596
YOU SHOULD ALL BE VERY PROUD
OF YOUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS.

07:50.763 --> 07:53.391
YOU KNOW, RECENTLY I...

07:53.558 --> 07:58.813
I SPOKE WITH MY SUPERIOR IN MANKATO
ABOUT MY EXPERIENCES HERE.

07:58.980 --> 08:01.440
I TOLD HIM THAT...

08:01.607 --> 08:05.319
THE ONLY THING
THAT I FELT WAS MISSING...

08:05.486 --> 08:06.779
WAS THE SOUND
OF A CHURCH BELL

08:06.946 --> 08:09.866
CALLING THE FAITHFUL TO
WORSHIP EVERY SUNDAY MORNING.

08:10.032 --> 08:11.159
[PEOPLE MUMBLING]

08:11.325 --> 08:12.994
NOW, ISN'T THAT WHAT WE NEED--

08:13.161 --> 08:14.829
A BELL FOR OUR CHURCH
HERE IN WALNUT GROVE?

08:14.996 --> 08:15.955
YES. YES, IT IS.

08:16.122 --> 08:18.624
OOH! I THINK
IT'S A GOOD IDEA!

08:18.791 --> 08:20.585
Man: So Do I.

08:20.751 --> 08:24.422
WELL, I PROPOSE
A SPECIAL COLLECTION.

08:24.589 --> 08:27.550
I THINK WE SHOULD
ALL SEARCH OUR HEARTS AND...

08:27.717 --> 08:29.302
AND OUR POCKETBOOKS

08:29.468 --> 08:30.803
AND GIVE WHAT WE CAN.

08:30.970 --> 08:34.015
WE CAN CHOOSE THE BELL AFTER
WE SEE WHAT WE CAN AFFORD.

08:34.182 --> 08:36.017
UH, REVEREND?

08:36.184 --> 08:36.976
MAY I SPEAK?

08:37.143 --> 08:38.644
WELL, CERTAINLY,
MRS. OLESON.

08:38.811 --> 08:39.896
THANK YOU.

08:41.439 --> 08:42.982
I, UH...

08:43.149 --> 08:46.652
I THINK THAT WE SHOULD
HAVE A VERY LARGE BELL

08:46.819 --> 08:50.740
LIKE THEY HAVE IN THE
CHURCHES IN ST. PAUL.

08:50.907 --> 08:52.617
MRS. OLESON,
THAT'S A WONDERFUL DREAM,

08:52.783 --> 08:55.870
BUT WALNUT GROVE
DOESN'T HAVE...

08:56.037 --> 08:59.874
WELL, NOR CAN WE COMPETE WITH
A CITY THE SIZE OF ST. PAUL.

09:00.041 --> 09:04.337
AND A BELL THAT SIZE,
UH, WE COULDN'T AFFORD.

09:04.503 --> 09:06.005
AH!

09:06.172 --> 09:11.135
WELL, MY HUSBAND AND I WOULD
LIKE TO CONTRIBUTE THE BELL.

09:11.302 --> 09:14.513
Reverend: WELL,
THAT'S VERY GENEROUS.

09:14.680 --> 09:19.227
WE WILL CONTRIBUTE THE
BELL AND THE PLAQUE.

09:19.393 --> 09:21.145
WHAT...PLAQUE?

09:24.398 --> 09:28.110
[SIGHS] DEDICATING IT
IN OUR NAMES.

09:28.277 --> 09:30.488
AFTER ALL...HEH,

09:30.655 --> 09:31.614
WE ARE PAYING FOR IT.

09:31.781 --> 09:34.283
UH, REVEREND,
MAY I SPEAK?

09:34.450 --> 09:36.327
Reverend: WELL,
CERTAINLY, MR. KENNEDY.

09:36.494 --> 09:37.828
NOW, I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT THE REST OF YOU,

09:37.995 --> 09:41.249
BUT...l FEEL THIS
IS GOD'S HOUSE,

09:41.415 --> 09:43.542
AND WE BUILT IT
WITH OUR OWN HANDS,

09:43.709 --> 09:48.756
AND I DON'T THINK THE LORD'S GOING TO LIKE
IT MUCH WE PUT SOMEBODY ELSE'S NAME ON IT.

09:48.923 --> 09:51.717
WHY, THAT'S THE MOST
UNGRATEFUL THING THAT I--

09:51.884 --> 09:53.052
NOW, HOLD IT A MINUTE.

09:53.219 --> 09:55.596
MRS. OLESON HAS BEEN KIND
ENOUGH TO MAKE THE OFFER,

09:55.763 --> 09:57.473
AND I THINK
WE OUGHT TO ACCEPT IT.

09:57.640 --> 09:59.183
NOW, WHAT COULD YOU GIVE,
KENNEDY?

09:59.350 --> 10:00.601
50 CENTS? A DOLLAR?

10:00.768 --> 10:01.686
AS MUCH AS I COULD,

10:01.852 --> 10:03.229
WHICH IS MORE
THAN YOU'D GIVE.

10:03.396 --> 10:04.897
YOU SIT THERE SNORING ALL THE
WAY THROUGH THE SERVICE.

10:05.064 --> 10:06.440
YOU NEVER HEAR
THE WORD OF THE LORD.

10:06.607 --> 10:08.401
AT LEAST I COME
TO CHURCH EVERY SUNDAY.

10:08.567 --> 10:10.736
PLEASE.

10:10.903 --> 10:14.448
LET'S NOT FORGET
WE'RE IN A CHURCH.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.076
WE'LL CONTINUE THE STORY
NEXT WEEK, CHILDREN.

10:17.243 --> 10:18.077
YOU CAN RUN ALONG NOW.

10:18.244 --> 10:20.413
[CHILDREN TALKING EXCITEDLY]

10:23.624 --> 10:25.042
WE NEED THAT BELL,
REVEREND.

10:25.209 --> 10:26.335
Reverend: THANK YOU.

10:28.838 --> 10:30.047
ALWAYS GOOD
TO SEE YOU, TINKER.

10:30.214 --> 10:31.632
YOU NEVER MISS
A SERVICE.

10:33.926 --> 10:34.969
THANK YOU, REVEREND.

10:35.136 --> 10:36.387
DON'T WORRY.
WE'LL HAVE OUR BELL.

10:36.554 --> 10:38.264
THANK YOU,
MISS BEADLE.

10:38.431 --> 10:41.934
LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING YOU VERY SOON, MR.
ALDEN. THANK YOU.

10:42.101 --> 10:43.102
I MEANT WHAT I SAID,
DORFLER.

10:43.269 --> 10:44.353
YOU GIVE
THAT WOMAN A PLAQUE,

10:44.520 --> 10:46.063
SHE GOING TO CHANGE
EVERYTHING.

10:46.230 --> 10:47.648
IF SHE GIVES US
A BELL, KENNEDY,

10:47.815 --> 10:49.108
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES
A LITTLE PLAQUE MAKE?

10:49.275 --> 10:50.109
WE DON'T EVEN
HAVE TO LOOK AT IT.

10:50.276 --> 10:51.610
OH, THE NEXT THING YOU KNOW,

10:51.777 --> 10:53.154
SHE'S GONNA CHANGE THE NAME
OF THIS TOWN TO OLESONVILLE.

10:53.321 --> 10:54.947
YOU ARE
A STUBBORN MAN.

10:55.114 --> 10:57.658
WELL, THAT MAY BE TRUE, BUT OLESON'S
NOT GOING TO RUN MY RELIGION.

10:57.825 --> 10:58.909
I TELL YOU. THAT
WON'T HAPPEN HERE.

10:59.076 --> 11:00.286
WELL, IT JUST MIGHT.

11:00.453 --> 11:02.955
WELL, MAYBE NOT AS BIG AS
THE BELLS IN ST. PAUL,

11:03.122 --> 11:07.626
BUT AT LEAST A LOT BIGGER THAN THE
ONES IN MANKATO OR SLEEPY EYE.

11:07.793 --> 11:09.879
THAT WILL CERTAINLY
SHOW THEM.

11:10.046 --> 11:11.130
WELL, THERE...

11:11.297 --> 11:15.551
THERE SEEM TO BE A FEW
WHO OPPOSE OUR GENEROSITY.

11:15.718 --> 11:20.806
BUT, WELL, I'M SURE
THAT...THEY'LL COME AROUND.

11:20.973 --> 11:23.976
HOW DO YOU FEEL,
UH, MR. HANSON?

11:24.143 --> 11:26.812
I APPROVE
OF THE BELL.

11:26.979 --> 11:27.813
MISS BEADLE?

11:27.980 --> 11:29.732
I THINK IT'S
A WONDERFUL IDEA.

11:29.899 --> 11:32.651
AND WE NEED THE BELL FOR THE
SCHOOL AS WELL AS THE CHURCH.

11:32.818 --> 11:35.905
OH! GOOD GRACIOUS!
NO!

11:36.072 --> 11:38.574
WHY, THAT WOULD
CLEARLY BE SACRILEGIOUS.

11:38.741 --> 11:43.037
WHY, A CHURCH BELL IS ONLY FOR
THE CHURCH AND NOTHING ELSE.

11:43.204 --> 11:45.998
[SCOFFS] COME ALONG, NELS.

11:46.165 --> 11:49.043
Miss Beadle: MRS. OLESON,
THAT'S NOT RIGHT.

11:49.210 --> 11:50.336
WELL, WE USE
THE SAME BUILDING.

11:50.503 --> 11:52.004
WHY CAN'T WE USE
THE SAME BELL?

11:52.171 --> 11:55.841
Dorfler: WE MAY HAVE
NEITHER CHURCH NOR SCHOOL.

11:56.008 --> 11:57.009
WHY?

11:57.176 --> 11:59.136
FROM THE SIZE BELL
THAT SHE WANTS,

11:59.303 --> 12:01.430
IT WOULD TIP
THAT BUILDING OVER.

12:01.597 --> 12:04.016
WE WOULD HAVE NOTHING
BUT A MESS OF KINDLING.

12:04.183 --> 12:04.975
HA HA HA!

12:05.142 --> 12:08.187
EXCUSE ME, MISS.

12:08.354 --> 12:09.939
Caroline: SEEMED
LIKE SUCH A NICE IDEA.

12:10.106 --> 12:12.316
YEAH. THE CHURCH
COULD USE A BELL.

12:12.483 --> 12:14.360
BUT MRS. OLESON WANTING
TO DO IT ALL BY HERSELF--

12:14.527 --> 12:16.028
I THINK THAT'S
A LITTLE TOO MUCH.

12:16.195 --> 12:17.238
WELL, THEY CAN AFFORD IT.

12:17.405 --> 12:18.364
I DON'T SEE WHAT'S
WRONG WITH IT.

12:18.531 --> 12:20.449
IT WAS THE WAY
SHE DID IT.

12:20.616 --> 12:21.409
[SIGHS]

12:21.575 --> 12:23.035
AND THAT PLAQUE.

12:23.202 --> 12:26.539
WELL, IT'S GOING TO GET A LOT
WORSE BEFORE IT GETS BETTER.

12:26.705 --> 12:28.624
I THINK THE REVEREND ALDEN'S
GOT A WAR ON HIS HANDS.

12:53.691 --> 12:56.902
I NOW HAVE THE FEELING I SHOULD
HAVE COME TO YOU FIRST, CHARLES,

12:57.069 --> 12:58.654
BUT I DIDN'T.

12:58.821 --> 13:01.949
I WENT TO THE OLESONS
AND THE NELSONS AND...

13:02.116 --> 13:03.409
I MET MR. TYLER,
MR. DORFLER,

13:03.576 --> 13:06.620
AND MR. KENNEDY
AT THE BLACKSMITH SHOP.

13:06.787 --> 13:08.706
I THOUGHT I COULD PREVAIL
ON MRS. OLESON

13:08.873 --> 13:10.624
TO LET OTHERS CONTRIBUTE
TOWARDS THE BELL,

13:10.791 --> 13:11.917
BUT SHE REFUSED.

13:13.752 --> 13:16.964
WE ACCEPT THE BELL
AS OFFERED,

13:17.131 --> 13:21.177
OR THE OLESON FAMILY WILL
ATTEND CHURCH IN SPRINGFIELD.

13:21.343 --> 13:24.346
SPRINGFIELD? THAT'S
A 50-MILE ROUND TRIP.

13:24.513 --> 13:26.265
I MENTIONED THAT...

13:26.432 --> 13:27.600
BUT SHE WAS ADAMANT.

13:29.393 --> 13:32.271
BUT SO ARE MR. KENNEDY
AND MR. TYLER.

13:32.438 --> 13:35.774
NOW THEY WANT NO PART OF MRS.
OLESON'S BELL AND PLAQUE.

13:35.941 --> 13:37.318
[DEEP INHALATION OF BREATH]

13:37.485 --> 13:38.402
THEY SAID THAT--

13:38.569 --> 13:41.614
OH, WE CAN IMAGINE
WHAT THEY SAID.

13:41.780 --> 13:44.074
WELL, IT'S
JUST AS WELL BECAUSE...

13:44.241 --> 13:45.367
SOME OF THE WORDS USED

13:45.534 --> 13:47.786
WOULDN'T BEAR REPEATING
WITH A LADY PRESENT.

13:51.207 --> 13:52.750
AND ONE THING
I DID FIND OUT--

13:52.917 --> 13:55.794
THE...ANGERS
ARE SPREADING.

13:55.961 --> 13:57.505
PEOPLE ARE
CHOOSING SIDES.

13:59.590 --> 14:01.133
IF I ACCEPT
THE OLESONS' OFFER,

14:01.300 --> 14:02.968
WE LOSE
HALF THE CONGREGATION.

14:05.179 --> 14:07.973
AND IF I DON'T,
WE LOSE THE OTHER HALF.

14:10.643 --> 14:11.810
[SIGHS]

14:11.977 --> 14:12.895
REVEREND,
THESE STORMS COME UP,

14:13.062 --> 14:14.522
AND THEN THEY BLOW OVER.

14:14.688 --> 14:17.483
YOU HAVE A LOT
OF FRIENDS HERE.

14:17.650 --> 14:18.776
THANK YOU.

14:20.277 --> 14:22.238
I'VE TAKEN UP
ENOUGH OF YOUR TIME.

14:22.404 --> 14:23.864
I'LL SEE YOU OUT.

14:24.031 --> 14:25.157
THANK YOU
FOR YOUR HOSPITALITY.

14:25.324 --> 14:26.492
GOOD NIGHT,
REVEREND.

14:35.167 --> 14:36.710
REVEREND, I DON'T KNOW IF lT'LL
MAKE YOU FEEL ANY BETTER,

14:36.877 --> 14:40.548
BUT IN YOUR ABSENCE, THE
ELDERS ALL GIVE A SERMON.

14:40.714 --> 14:42.424
THEY TAKE THEIR TURNS.

14:42.591 --> 14:43.884
IF YOU'RE EVER IN CHURCH
TO HEAR ONE OF THOSE,

14:44.051 --> 14:47.513
YOU'D REALIZE HOW
WELCOME YOU REALLY ARE.

14:47.680 --> 14:50.307
WHAT I HAVEN'T TOLD YOU
IS THAT, UM...

14:50.474 --> 14:52.059
PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES
OF THE ARGUMENT

14:52.226 --> 14:53.519
HAVE THREATENED
TO WRITE MY SUPERIOR

14:53.686 --> 14:55.187
AND ASK
TO HAVE ME REPLACED.

14:57.648 --> 14:59.817
WELL, LIKE I SAID,
THESE STORMS BLOW OVER.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.694
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME
LOOK INTO THAT?

15:01.860 --> 15:04.321
I'D APPRECIATE IT.

15:04.488 --> 15:06.699
YOU MIGHT TELL
EVERYBODY CONCERNED...

15:06.865 --> 15:10.202
I ONLY WANT WHAT'S BEST FOR THE
CHURCH AND THE CONGREGATION.

15:10.369 --> 15:11.870
I THINK
WE ALL KNOW THAT.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.372
THANK YOU AGAIN.
GOOD NIGHT.

15:13.539 --> 15:14.290
GOOD NIGHT.

15:14.456 --> 15:16.333
LET'S GO,
JEHOSHAPHAT, GO.

15:45.904 --> 15:46.905
KENNEDY,
HOW YOU DOING?

15:47.072 --> 15:48.616
HELLO, INGALLS.
WHAT CAN I DO FOR YOU?

15:48.782 --> 15:49.783
JUST STOPPED BY.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.160
WANTED YOU TO KNOW
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

15:51.327 --> 15:52.911
A MEETING AT THE CHURCH
TONIGHT ABOUT 7:00.

15:53.078 --> 15:54.288
OH? WHAT FOR?

15:54.455 --> 15:55.581
DISCUSS THE BELL.

15:56.874 --> 15:57.916
THERE'S NOTHING
TO DISCUSS.

15:58.083 --> 15:59.251
THE MATTER'S BEEN SETTLED.

16:00.711 --> 16:01.587
I WASN'T AWARE OF THAT.

16:01.754 --> 16:02.963
WELL, LET ME PUT IT
ANOTHER WAY.

16:03.130 --> 16:05.049
IT'S BEEN SETTLED
AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED.

16:05.215 --> 16:06.258
NOW COME ON, KENNEDY,

16:06.425 --> 16:07.551
GIVE THE REST OF THE
CONGREGATION A CHANCE.

16:07.718 --> 16:09.720
IT'S NOT GOING
TO HURT YOU TO LISTEN.

16:09.887 --> 16:11.430
ALL RIGHT. I'LL LISTEN.

16:11.597 --> 16:13.307
BUT MY MIND'S
MADE UP, INGALLS,

16:13.474 --> 16:15.434
AND WE DON'T WANT
NO OLESON BELL,

16:15.601 --> 16:17.478
AND THAT'S FINAL.

16:17.645 --> 16:18.937
[PEOPLE ALL TALKING
AT ONCE]

16:19.104 --> 16:20.689
CAN WE HAVE
SOME QUIET PLEASE?

16:20.856 --> 16:21.940
THANK YOU.

16:25.486 --> 16:26.737
I THOUGHT WE SHOULD
HAVE THIS MEETING

16:26.904 --> 16:30.240
TO DISCUSS THE REVEREND
ALDEN'S SUGGESTION.

16:30.407 --> 16:31.825
I THINK WE CAN DISCUSS IT
AS FRIENDS, NEIGHBORS,

16:31.992 --> 16:34.286
AND MEMBERS
OF THE CONGREGATION.

16:37.164 --> 16:38.791
I SUGGEST WE THINK IN TERMS
OF A COMPROMISE.

16:38.957 --> 16:43.545
THERE'S NO ONE OF US THAT CAN HAVE
HIS OR HER WAY ON EVERYTHING.

16:45.506 --> 16:48.550
I PERSONALLY THINK
WE NEED A BELL.

16:48.717 --> 16:51.303
WE'VE HAD AN OFFER OF SUCH
A BELL FROM THE OLESONS.

16:51.470 --> 16:52.179
AND A PLAQUE.

16:52.346 --> 16:53.514
DON'T FORGET
THE PLAQUE.

16:53.681 --> 16:57.226
THE BELL AND THE PLAQUE.
THANK YOU, MR. KENNEDY.

16:57.393 --> 16:58.560
NOW, I THINK
WE SHOULD HEAR

16:58.727 --> 17:02.731
FROM THOSE WHO ARE WILLING
TO ACCEPT THAT OFFER

17:02.898 --> 17:04.775
AND THOSE WHO ARE OPPOSED.

17:04.942 --> 17:06.610
I THINK WE OUGHT
TO ACCEPT THE GIFT

17:06.777 --> 17:08.362
IN THE MANNER IN WHICH
IT WAS INTENDED.

17:08.529 --> 17:10.948
WELL, NOW, THAT'S
JUST WHAT I DON'T LIKE.

17:11.115 --> 17:13.242
DON'T YOU REMEMBER
HOW HARD WE WORKED?

17:13.409 --> 17:15.953
WE BUILT THIS CHURCH
IN HONOR OF THE LORD.

17:16.120 --> 17:17.955
WE DONATED THE BOARDS
AND THE JOIST

17:18.122 --> 17:20.916
AND THE BEAMS AND
THE RAFTERS TO HIM,

17:21.083 --> 17:23.460
AND WE DIDN'T PUT OUR
NAMES ON NONE OF IT.

17:23.627 --> 17:26.255
OH, NOW, REALLY. THAT
IS NOT THE POINT.

17:26.422 --> 17:27.339
THAT IS THE POINT.

17:27.506 --> 17:28.257
WAIT! PLEASE!

17:28.424 --> 17:31.343
UH...THIS IS
THE HOUSE OF GOD.

17:31.510 --> 17:35.139
NOW LET'S CONDUCT OUR
DISCUSSION QUIETLY.

17:35.305 --> 17:36.890
WE TAKE THAT BELL,

17:37.057 --> 17:38.517
IT'S GOING TO BE
THE OLESON HOUSE,

17:38.684 --> 17:40.018
BELL, PEW, AND PULPIT.

17:40.185 --> 17:41.186
AND I'LL TELL YOU
SOMETHING ELSE, INGALLS.

17:41.353 --> 17:42.771
SHE'LL BE DOING
THE SERMON.

17:42.938 --> 17:43.897
Man: THAT'S SACRILEGIOUS.

17:44.064 --> 17:47.109
NOW, WAIT.
UH, I SUGGEST

17:47.276 --> 17:49.319
THAT WE FORGET ABOUT
THE OLESONS' BELL,

17:49.486 --> 17:50.821
AND THAT
WE START OVER

17:50.988 --> 17:53.365
AND WE TAKE A COLLECTION SO
ALL OF US CAN CONTRIBUTE.

17:53.532 --> 17:54.700
OH, WELL, THIS IS THE--

17:54.867 --> 17:57.578
YOU ARE A MEASLY MAN!

17:57.745 --> 17:58.704
NELS, I WILL NOT
STAY HERE AND BE INSULTED.

17:58.871 --> 17:59.621
COME ALONG.

17:59.788 --> 18:01.081
NO! WAIT! PLEASE!

18:01.248 --> 18:03.333
OH, BE QUIET. I'M NOT GOING
TO DISCUSS IT ANY LONGER.

18:03.500 --> 18:04.710
NO INSULT INTENDED.

18:04.877 --> 18:06.086
ALL I WANTED WAS
SO WE COULD ALL

18:06.253 --> 18:07.755
CONTRIBUTE TO THE BELL.

18:07.921 --> 18:09.548
GOOD RIDDANCE!

18:09.715 --> 18:13.385
MR. KENNEDY, IF YOU WOULD KEEP
A CIVIL TONGUE IN YOUR HEAD,

18:13.552 --> 18:15.804
WE MIGHT JUST GET SOMETHING
ACCOMPLISHED HERE!

18:20.726 --> 18:21.977
ALL RIGHT, I THINK
WE SHOULD TAKE THE VOTE

18:22.144 --> 18:25.147
ALL THOSE IN FAVOR
OF A SPECIAL CONTRIBUTION.

18:25.314 --> 18:27.816
MR. INGALLS,
WE'RE A POOR COMMUNITY.

18:27.983 --> 18:29.234
IF WE ACCEPT A GIFT
OF THE BELL,

18:29.401 --> 18:31.820
THAT WAY, IT WON'T
COST US ANYTHING.

18:31.987 --> 18:33.489
IF WE TAKE THE BELL

18:33.655 --> 18:35.407
AND THEN YOU WILL
WANT A NEW CHURCH,

18:35.574 --> 18:37.159
THAT ALSO SHOULD
BE FOR FREE?

18:37.326 --> 18:39.369
HANSON, THAT'S
NOT TRUE.

18:39.536 --> 18:41.038
WELL, NOT EXACTLY
FOR NOTHING, HANSON.

18:41.205 --> 18:42.080
YOU'RE GONNA BE
STANDING RIGHT THERE

18:42.247 --> 18:44.082
READY TO SELL
THE LUMBER.

18:44.249 --> 18:46.752
MR. KENNEDY.
LISTEN.

18:46.919 --> 18:48.754
I CONTRIBUTE
AS MUCH AS ANY MAN

18:48.921 --> 18:50.547
IN THIS TOWN,
AND I WILL--

18:50.714 --> 18:52.633
I THOUGHT WE CAME HERE
TO DISCUSS THE BELL.

18:52.800 --> 18:54.843
WHY DON'T WE FORGET
THAT BLEEDING BELL?

18:55.010 --> 18:56.887
WE DONE ALL RIGHT
WITHOUT IT UP TO NOW.

18:57.054 --> 18:58.514
SHOW OF HANDS.
Hanson: FOR WHAT?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.307
THAT'S IT, INGALLS.
THE MEETING'S ADJOURNED.

19:00.474 --> 19:03.602
[ALL TALKING AT ONCE]

19:03.769 --> 19:05.395
Hanson: No,
WAIT, COME BACK.

19:05.562 --> 19:07.523
GET--BRING HIM
BACK HERE.

19:07.689 --> 19:09.066
KENNEDY,
COME HERE.

19:09.233 --> 19:12.277
BRING HIM BACK
IN HERE.

19:12.444 --> 19:14.154
HEY, KENNEDY!

19:18.659 --> 19:19.785
[DOOR CLOSES]

19:25.999 --> 19:27.209
YOU WOULDN'T HAVE
BELIEVED IT.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.838
START OUT
DISCUSSING THE BELL,

19:31.004 --> 19:32.714
NEXT THING YOU KNOW IT'S THE
BATTLE OF THE LITTLE BIG HORN.

19:32.881 --> 19:36.176
I CAN'T TELL THE SOLDIERS
FROM THE INDIANS.

19:36.343 --> 19:38.220
WELL, DIDN'T THEY
LISTEN, PA?

19:38.387 --> 19:39.513
I'M AFRAID NOT,
HALF-PINT.

19:39.680 --> 19:41.682
THEY'RE ALL TOO BUSY
YELLING, SHOUTING.

19:41.849 --> 19:43.392
I DO DECLARE.

19:43.559 --> 19:46.603
A BUNCH OF GROWNUPS
CARRYING ON LIKE CHILDREN.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.772
CHILDREN WOULDN'T
HAVE BEEN THAT NOISY.

19:48.939 --> 19:51.942
DOES THIS MEAN THERE WON'T
BE ANY CHURCH ON SUNDAY?

19:52.109 --> 19:54.152
I WAS BEGINNING
TO LIKE SUNDAY SCHOOL

19:54.319 --> 19:57.573
EVEN IF THEY DID REPEAT A LOT OF
STORIES MARY AND I ALREADY KNEW.

20:01.493 --> 20:02.744
IF WE HAVE TO,

20:02.911 --> 20:04.705
WE'LL WORSHIP AND HAVE
SUNDAY SCHOOL RIGHT HERE.

20:08.959 --> 20:10.168
WE'VE DONE IT BEFORE.

20:42.034 --> 20:43.243
LET'S PLAY
UNCLE JOHN.

20:43.410 --> 20:44.578
WE CAN'T.

20:44.745 --> 20:45.454
WHY NOT?

20:45.621 --> 20:46.747
OUR FATHERS WON'T LET US

20:46.914 --> 20:49.541
BECAUSE OF WHAT YOUR FATHER
SAID ABOUT THE BELL.

20:49.708 --> 20:51.668
AREN'T WE
FRIENDS ANYMORE?

20:51.835 --> 20:53.545
WE CAN'T PLAY
WITH THEM EITHER.

21:06.433 --> 21:07.893
Laura: WE CAUGHT A LOT!

21:08.060 --> 21:10.646
HEY, WE GOT
PLENTY HERE FOR SUPPER.

21:10.812 --> 21:12.397
UHH!

21:12.564 --> 21:14.566
NICE SIZE ONES, TOO.

21:14.733 --> 21:18.445
I'M WONDERING, WHY IS EVERYBODY
MAD AT REVEREND ALDEN?

21:18.612 --> 21:21.740
OH, THEY'RE NOT MAD AT THE
REVEREND ALDEN, HALF-PINT.

21:21.907 --> 21:24.201
THEY'RE MAD AT THEMSELVES.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.744
Mary:
FIGHTING OVER A BELL.

21:25.911 --> 21:27.162
I THINK THAT'S SILLY.

21:27.329 --> 21:31.083
WELL, MARY, GROWNUPS CAN
BE PRETTY SILLY SOMETIMES,

21:31.249 --> 21:33.126
LIKE LITTLE BOYS
AND GIRLS.

21:33.293 --> 21:35.420
YOU MEAN LIKE MARY AND ME?

21:35.587 --> 21:36.713
THAT'S RIGHT.

21:36.880 --> 21:38.090
AND GROWNUPS CAN BE
MORE STUBBORN.

21:38.256 --> 21:39.257
WHY?

21:39.424 --> 21:41.134
THEY'VE HAD A LOT MORE
TIME TO PRACTICE.

24:32.097 --> 24:33.223
WOULD YOU MIND?

24:33.390 --> 24:35.851
I'D LIKE TO GO HAVE A TALK
WITH MRS. KENNEDY.

24:37.936 --> 24:40.438
YOU REALLY THINK
IT'S GOING TO DO ANY GOOD?

24:40.605 --> 24:44.401
I THINK IT'S HIGH TIME THE
WOMEN TOOK THIS THING IN HAND.

24:44.568 --> 24:46.403

HAVE BETTER LUCK THAN I DID.

24:47.821 --> 24:49.406
YES, MA,
MAY WE?

I DON'T SEE
ANY REASON WHY NOT.

END TO THE HARD FEELINGS.

25:27.319 --> 25:28.445
YOUR HUSBAND SEND YOU?

25:30.238 --> 25:31.740
NO...

25:31.907 --> 25:34.784
BUT HE IS AWARE OF MY VISIT,
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU MEAN.

25:34.951 --> 25:37.871
WELL, I WAS JUST WONDERING
WHO RULES YOUR ROOST.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.123
HERE, I MAKE THE DECISIONS.

[SIGHS] MR. KENNEDY,
DON'T YOU REALIZE

25:43.126 --> 25:46.338
THAT ALL THIS SENSELESS
SQUABBLING IS RUINING OUR CHURCH,

25:46.504 --> 25:47.964

NOT MINE.
