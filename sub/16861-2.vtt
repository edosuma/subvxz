00:01.042 --> 00:02.544
<i>Previously on</i> Rescue Me...

00:02.544 --> 00:05.255
- Let me get this straight.
- I'm banging my science teacher.

00:05.255 --> 00:07.465
- Mrs. Turbody?
- Do you want to ask me something?

00:07.465 --> 00:10.635
Quite frankly, missy,
I'm pretty disgusted.

00:10.635 --> 00:14.723
I'll only discuss this
off school grounds over drinks.

00:14.723 --> 00:17.017
<i>You're telling me
that I have to put my wife</i>

00:17.017 --> 00:19.185
<i>of 31 years into a home?</i>

00:19.185 --> 00:20.562
Goodbye, Jerry.

00:21.104 --> 00:22.147
Hey, Daddy.

00:22.147 --> 00:25.567
She never even had the decency
to come to her own mother's funeral.

00:25.567 --> 00:27.694
- She's changed.
- Now come on over here.

00:28.695 --> 00:31.531
You know anything about this
chick Garrity's been seeing?

00:31.531 --> 00:34.409
<i>No, he's been tight-lipped about her.
I know she's older, though.</i>

00:34.409 --> 00:37.245
So, uh,
have you given any more thought to,

00:37.245 --> 00:39.372
- you know, when we might, uh...
- Tell Tommy?

00:39.372 --> 00:41.082
- Yeah.
- No.

00:41.082 --> 00:43.293
<i>You can't keep your eye
on your own son</i>

00:43.293 --> 00:45.587
<i>while he rides his bike
down the goddamn block.</i>

00:45.587 --> 00:49.799
You came to me
and asked to be taken back in.

00:49.799 --> 00:52.635
There's blood on my hands,
there's blood on your hands too.

00:52.635 --> 00:55.221
You know, the only good thing
to come out of this is that now

00:55.221 --> 01:00.018
I don't have to watch Connor grow up
and turn out exactly like you.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.937
I don't belong to F-Bomb anymore.
I don't belong to anyone.

01:02.937 --> 01:04.522
- He took the money?
<i>- Yes, sir.</i>

01:04.522 --> 01:06.191
How long did you know her?

01:06.775 --> 01:09.611
Uh, a little over a month.
Said she could buy her way out

01:09.611 --> 01:14.449
<i>if she had enough money to give
to her pimp. I gave her $18,000.</i>

01:14.449 --> 01:15.784
<i>Did she give you a name?</i>

01:15.784 --> 01:17.285
<i>She said her name was Candy.</i>

01:17.285 --> 01:19.370
<i>Janet's not
gonna go the lawyer route,</i>

01:19.370 --> 01:21.331
<i>- so you don't have to waste money.</i>
- <i>Uh-huh.</i>

01:21.331 --> 01:22.832
<i>She wants you to cover her expenses</i>

01:22.832 --> 01:25.376
<i>- and the costs for the girls.</i>
- Is she seeing someone?

01:28.254 --> 01:30.715
Is everybody
coming to the party?

01:30.715 --> 01:33.218
Yeah, I'm just waiting
to hear from a few people.

01:33.218 --> 01:35.345
Some people I hope I never hear from.

01:35.345 --> 01:38.473
It's my party. I want the whole
goddamn family there, including Janet.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.683
I know, but it is gonna ruin it for Tommy.

01:40.683 --> 01:43.144
It's gonna be a total disaster.
I can see it.

01:43.144 --> 01:46.773
Are you kidding? We're gonna have
chink food and birthday cake.

01:46.773 --> 01:49.150
You can't have a disaster
with that combination.

01:49.150 --> 01:52.570
If they had had chink food
and birthday cake

01:52.570 --> 01:56.407
at Normandy, World War II, over.

01:59.577 --> 02:01.037
Does Tommy talk about me?

02:01.037 --> 02:03.456
Oh, for Christ's sake.
Get me a cup of tea.

02:03.456 --> 02:07.127
This whole comin' over here and lookin'
after you thing, is it really about

02:07.127 --> 02:12.423
comin' over here and lookin' after you
or is it some kind of, you know, thing?

02:12.423 --> 02:16.761
Now, look, I pissed the bed
three times in the last 15 days.

02:17.262 --> 02:19.722
I can't drive anymore
and I can barely walk.

02:19.722 --> 02:22.892
Believe me,
the last goddamn thing this is,

02:22.892 --> 02:24.060
is a goddamn thing.

02:24.060 --> 02:27.188
- What thing?
- Oh, this thing. Look.

02:27.939 --> 02:29.941
- What is it?
- It's a travel mug, so you can

02:29.941 --> 02:31.818
drink coffee on the way to work.
Nice, right?

02:31.818 --> 02:34.279
It's gorgeous. They should
put a little screen in the side

02:34.279 --> 02:36.281
so you can watch gay porn between sips.

02:36.281 --> 02:38.032
- It's nice!
- It's gay.

02:38.032 --> 02:39.659
It's got a no-spill feature.

02:39.659 --> 02:41.161
- Yeah.
- A lot of these mugs,

02:41.161 --> 02:43.705
um, they say that they have it,
and it's total bullshit

02:43.705 --> 02:46.666
because this has
a absolute no-spill feature.

02:46.666 --> 02:48.168
I read about it in GQ.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.295
Really? Who wrote the article,
Brian Boitano?

02:50.295 --> 02:53.173
Speaking of Brian Boitano,
Janet's coming to the party.

02:53.339 --> 02:55.008
- So?
- Just so you know.

02:55.008 --> 02:58.386
I don't care. It's a family event.
She should be there. I got no problem.

02:58.386 --> 03:00.847
Unless she brings her
new boyfriend, in which case,

03:00.847 --> 03:04.893
I'm gonna stick this <i>Brokeback</i> coffee
travel thing right up his goddamn ass.

03:05.059 --> 03:06.895
- You know she's got a guy?
- Eh.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.022
She didn't waste
much time, did she?

03:09.022 --> 03:10.523
And people call me a whore.

03:13.693 --> 03:14.694
Well, they do.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.321
I gotta go.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.739
- Wait, wait, take your mug.
- No.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.199
- Take it.
- I don't want it.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.283
- Why not?
- Becau...

03:20.283 --> 03:22.827
I quit smokin'. If I...
If I have coffee in the car,

03:22.827 --> 03:24.120
I'm gonna want a smoke, so...

03:24.120 --> 03:26.831
- Oh bullshit, you quit!
- We all quit smokin' at the house, okay?

03:26.831 --> 03:29.042
Everybody put 50 bucks
into, you know, the pool,

03:29.042 --> 03:31.920
and last man standing
gets to take the whole kitty.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.380
Oh, oh, the mugs too gay,

03:34.380 --> 03:37.967
but the word "kitty", without there
being a cat around, apparently not!

03:37.967 --> 03:40.178
Wow, six guys.

03:40.678 --> 03:42.889
You know, if only three of them screw up,

03:43.056 --> 03:45.141
- that's a nice chunk of change.
- Yep.

03:45.141 --> 03:48.311
- What are you gonna do if you win?
- Pssh. Buy some cigarettes.

03:49.437 --> 03:53.149
Wait, Tommy, Tommy, Tommy. Listen,
I was gonna come back this afternoon

03:53.149 --> 03:56.819
and check up on Pops, but I can't
'cause now I have a parent-teacher meeting

03:56.819 --> 03:58.029
at Damian's school.

03:58.029 --> 04:00.907
- About what?
- I don't know, bad grades, bad attitude.

04:00.907 --> 04:03.952
He ever mention a teacher to you,
a Miss Turbody?

04:05.703 --> 04:08.831
- No. Nope.
- Well, that's who I'm meeting.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.960
She must be pretty special
'cause Damian just loves her.

04:11.960 --> 04:13.544
- Really?
- Yeah.

04:15.463 --> 04:16.464
What?

04:16.464 --> 04:19.300
- You've seen her.
- Seen who? What are you talkin' about?

04:19.300 --> 04:23.137
Oh, God, I know! I know,
not only do you know who she is

04:23.137 --> 04:25.723
but you've seen her,
and you obviously think she's hot!

04:25.723 --> 04:27.100
Come to...

04:27.100 --> 04:30.144
I know all your grunts
and your tics and your tells.

04:30.144 --> 04:31.271
- Really? Yeah?
- Yeah.

04:31.271 --> 04:33.231
- Yeah, inside and out.
- Mhm.

04:33.231 --> 04:36.442
Especially the tell
that involves the "uh-huh"

04:36.442 --> 04:38.528
with your tongue lickin'
at your lower lip.

04:38.528 --> 04:41.030
It means you are lying
at your basest level.

04:41.030 --> 04:42.115
I gotta go.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.242
I can read you
like a dog-eared goddamn book.

04:44.242 --> 04:46.619
I was dropping him off
for the sex talk thing,

04:46.619 --> 04:48.037
and he pointed her out.

04:50.790 --> 04:52.292
Don't forget to give Dad his enema.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.085
- Wait, what?
- Gotcha.

05:02.093 --> 05:03.094
All right.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.494
<i>On another day
C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:28.494 --> 05:31.831
<i>With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong</i>

05:32.206 --> 05:34.959
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

05:35.293 --> 05:38.212
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

05:38.212 --> 05:41.424
<i>With my teeth locked down
I could see the blood</i>

05:41.424 --> 05:44.844
<i>Of a thousand men who have come and gone</i>

05:44.844 --> 05:48.181
<i>Now we grieve 'cause now is gone</i>

05:48.181 --> 05:51.100
<i>Things were good when we were young</i>

05:51.100 --> 05:54.437
<i>-Is it safe to stay?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:54.437 --> 05:57.732
<i>-Was it right to leave?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

05:57.732 --> 06:00.943
<i>- Will I ever learn?
- C'mon, c'mon</i>

06:00.943 --> 06:04.447
<i>C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon</i>

06:09.369 --> 06:10.370
Hey.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.663
Hey, day tour starts
at 9:00 a.m., Lieutenant.

06:12.663 --> 06:15.041
Oh, really? I didn't know. Tommy here yet?

06:15.208 --> 06:17.543
Yeah, he just got here
a couple of minutes ago.

06:17.543 --> 06:19.754
- Can I talk to you?
- About that smoking thing?

06:19.754 --> 06:21.339
- What?
- Never mind.

06:25.718 --> 06:28.554
I have a situation. Uh, that
place where I have Jeannie?

06:28.554 --> 06:31.641
- The place in Connecticut.
- Yeah. They just raised the monthly rent

06:31.641 --> 06:34.894
another 250 bucks.
I mean, it's not that I don't have it,

06:34.894 --> 06:37.271
but I just, uh, figured
if I did get in a pinch,

06:37.271 --> 06:39.107
- maybe I could come to you.
- I don't know, Jer.

06:39.857 --> 06:42.985
Tommy's dealing with his wife
and his finances are a mess.

06:42.985 --> 06:45.780
And the young guys, I mean,
those julio fongulios

06:45.780 --> 06:47.907
- are livin' paycheck to paycheck.
- Right.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.159
It's not like you're
hurtin' for money, right?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.912
I mean, you just sold the house.
You must be sittin' pretty.

06:53.538 --> 06:55.790
Yeah, well, you know,

06:55.790 --> 06:59.210
I had to give half to the ex-wife,
plus I had a second mortgage to pay off.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.295
I'm sittin', but it ain't pretty,
believe me.

07:01.295 --> 07:04.882
This'd only be a couple of hundred bucks,
and that's if I even need it.

07:06.175 --> 07:09.303
Did you ever think about maybe, you know,
moving her someplace?

07:09.303 --> 07:12.515
I mean, someplace cheaper?
It's not like she's gonna know.

07:12.515 --> 07:13.808
Jesus, Lou.

07:13.808 --> 07:15.476
I'm sorry, Jer. I'm...

07:15.476 --> 07:18.938
But, look, just... if I need
a couple of hundred bucks,

07:18.938 --> 07:20.481
I mean, can I come to you?

07:20.481 --> 07:22.692
- Sure.
- You sure?

07:22.692 --> 07:24.610
Yeah. Sure, it's fine.

07:24.610 --> 07:26.070
Thanks, Kenny.

07:29.115 --> 07:32.452
So anyways, he spits the cigar out
like I didn't even see him, you know?

07:32.452 --> 07:34.162
- Right in front of me.
- Second offense,

07:34.162 --> 07:36.706
that's 100 bucks in the kitty.
Thank you, Lieutenant Shea.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041
Do you mind if we call
the kitty the can from now?

07:39.041 --> 07:40.334
Why?

07:40.751 --> 07:41.961
Ah, it's just an idea.

07:47.467 --> 07:49.677
What's, uh... What's going on with that?

07:49.677 --> 07:51.846
Oh, nothing. I'm, uh...

07:51.846 --> 07:54.098
thinking about taking
the lieutenant's exam.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.017
Really?

07:56.017 --> 07:58.811
Yeah. You know, uh,
the test's in a few months.

07:58.811 --> 08:02.023
Well, if you're looking for
less fires and more paperwork,

08:02.023 --> 08:03.566
I guess that's a good idea.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.985
I don't know, Tom,
I'm just, um, thinking about

08:05.985 --> 08:07.445
you know, wanna better myself,

08:07.445 --> 08:09.489
- my position.
- Uh-huh.

08:09.489 --> 08:11.657
I don't know.
Life's all about moving up, right?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.244
You know, Frankie, uh, when I started out,

08:15.244 --> 08:18.331
first firehouse I was in,
it was me and four fat guys,

08:18.331 --> 08:21.667
and I think sometimes we forget
what a good crew we have here.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.669
You take that test, you just get assigned.

08:23.669 --> 08:26.464
You could end up with a midget
and... and four idiots,

08:26.464 --> 08:28.549
but you're in charge.
Is that what you want?

08:28.549 --> 08:30.593
I got a kid at home, Tom, okay?

08:30.593 --> 08:31.969
A Puerto Rican kid.

08:31.969 --> 08:34.138
You know, her mom was a spic. I'm a spic,

08:34.138 --> 08:36.974
and she's gonna end up stuck in
New York City public schools

08:36.974 --> 08:40.186
for the next goddamn decade
unless I do something about it.

08:40.186 --> 08:43.814
I mean, personally, I'd like to see her
in the best private schools in the city

08:43.814 --> 08:47.360
with wealthy white kids, schools
where they don't stab or kill each other.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.321
Where they just do really good drugs,
get incredible grades,

08:50.321 --> 08:53.616
and go to great white colleges,
do even better drugs,

08:53.616 --> 08:56.536
and then graduate with
well-connected white friends

08:56.536 --> 08:58.829
who can help them get hired
into the upper echelons

08:58.829 --> 09:00.414
of white American society.

09:00.414 --> 09:03.834
Now those schools, they top out
at what, like, 15 grand a year now?

09:03.834 --> 09:06.295
And ultimately in college,
almost 50k a pop.

09:06.295 --> 09:09.924
Now if I'm a lieutenant making
almost 50 grand a year total,

09:09.924 --> 09:13.094
I don't know, you know, between
me and the federal government,

09:13.094 --> 09:14.971
maybe I can pull it off.

09:15.846 --> 09:17.056
She's Puerto Rican, man.

09:17.056 --> 09:19.350
She's also a girl with no mom.

09:21.477 --> 09:22.770
I need to do her solid.

09:22.770 --> 09:24.188
I gotcha.

09:26.107 --> 09:29.735
You know they... They have blow job
contests in those private schools.

09:29.735 --> 09:32.363
There was a huge article
in the <i>New York</i> magazine.

09:32.363 --> 09:33.489
Yeah. I read it, Tom.

09:33.489 --> 09:36.701
Maybe I'm hoping my kid
has a shot at winning one of those.

09:39.829 --> 09:41.789
Holy shit. How much?

09:41.789 --> 09:42.957
Four fifty.

09:42.957 --> 09:45.001
Holy shit. It's only been a couple days.

09:45.167 --> 09:46.877
But Tommy put in 50. Lou put in 50.

09:46.877 --> 09:48.462
I put in 50. How much you put in?

09:48.462 --> 09:50.715
- A hundred fifty.
- No way.

09:50.715 --> 09:52.091
- Way, bro.
- What happened?

09:52.091 --> 09:54.760
I went to have dinner with Polack Dave.
You remember him.

09:54.760 --> 09:57.972
- Yeah. He's a nice guy.
- Yeah. Not even Polish. Weird, huh?

09:57.972 --> 10:01.642
Anyway, his wife makes dinner,
apple pie for dessert. Strike one.

10:01.642 --> 10:03.686
I can't have apple pie
without a cigarette.

10:03.686 --> 10:05.605
- What?
- It's a chemical thing.

10:05.605 --> 10:08.399
I get that. I got the same thing,
only for me it's chocolate.

10:08.399 --> 10:10.484
Mine's apple pie.
Oh, I had another cigarette

10:10.484 --> 10:12.320
when I was having sex with my girlfriend.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.863
Yeah, the old cigarette after sex.

10:13.863 --> 10:15.197
No, it's more like during.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.033
You know, she was on top and I, uh,

10:17.033 --> 10:20.202
I couldn't really focus,
get the job done watching her inhale,

10:20.202 --> 10:23.956
so I light up, bing, bang, boom,
saints go marching in.

10:23.956 --> 10:26.667
Oh. You're awfully quiet there, Lou.
Nothing to add?

10:26.667 --> 10:30.087
Don't worry. Soon as I think of something
as equally idiotic, I'll chime in.

10:30.087 --> 10:33.549
Put your, uh, money
in the can there, uh, Smoky?

10:33.549 --> 10:34.842
You're a regular riot, Alice.

10:34.842 --> 10:37.678
Tommy bagged Lou crossing a street
with a big old heater goin'.

10:37.678 --> 10:40.431
Oh, busted, Lou.
That's 100 bucks in the kitty.

10:40.431 --> 10:41.974
In the can, 100 bucks in the can.

10:41.974 --> 10:44.226
Kitty, can, whatever.
Come on, sailor, pony up.

10:44.226 --> 10:46.062
Sorry, guys, I'm a little light today.

10:46.062 --> 10:47.730
You always got a wad of cabbage.

10:47.730 --> 10:49.649
Not today, all right? I'll get it in.

10:49.649 --> 10:52.068
- Well, when?
- Don't think I'm good for it?

10:52.068 --> 10:53.152
I... I didn't say that.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.154
I told you I'm gonna put it in there.

10:57.239 --> 11:00.201
- When? By the end of the day?
- Screw you guys, all right?

11:00.201 --> 11:02.078
Make your own goddamn lunch. I'm done.

11:02.078 --> 11:03.663
- Lou...
- Shut your face.

11:03.663 --> 11:05.373
I'm done, you bunch of assholes.

11:05.498 --> 11:07.792
Oh. Whoo-hoo-hoo.

11:07.792 --> 11:08.876
What did I do?

11:08.876 --> 11:10.378
He's been a bit on edge lately.

11:10.378 --> 11:12.463
The no-smoking thing isn't helping.

11:12.463 --> 11:14.340
- Stop talking about me!
- We're not.

11:14.340 --> 11:17.259
- Bullshit.
- You coming to the party, right?

11:17.259 --> 11:19.512
- Yes.
- You gonna bring your new girl?

11:19.512 --> 11:21.847
Yeah, we can finally
get a look at her, you know.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.100
No. She's... She's not
gonna be there at all.

11:24.100 --> 11:25.726
- At all.
- No, not at all.

11:25.726 --> 11:27.478
She, uh... She can't...

11:27.478 --> 11:29.897
Um, she can't come late to things,

11:29.897 --> 11:32.692
so she's just, it's, like
of all the people at the party,

11:32.692 --> 11:34.485
- she's not gonna...
- Great. Great.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.071
You bringing somebody
less complicated, hopefully?

11:37.071 --> 11:40.116
Uh, No. I'm banging this chick,
but I've never seen her out with people.

11:40.116 --> 11:42.702
If she eats the way she gets it on,
nobody needs to see that.

11:42.702 --> 11:44.203
- Really?
- Yeah.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.580
Well, I'm coming too, by myself,

11:46.580 --> 11:48.708
and it's the last thing
I'm saying to you assholes.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.918
Still pissed off
about that kitty bullshit.

11:50.918 --> 11:53.754
- You... you mean the can bullshit.
- What can?

11:53.754 --> 11:55.339
You're pissed off about the can.

11:55.339 --> 11:57.675
- What... I messed up the can?
- Forget the can.

11:57.675 --> 12:00.177
You know what?
Screw the kitty. Screw the can.

12:00.177 --> 12:01.804
That's all I'm saying to you guys.

12:01.804 --> 12:04.140
- From now on, I'm not here!
- All right!

12:04.306 --> 12:06.475
Holy shit.

12:06.475 --> 12:09.437
Jesus. Who you bringing, Tom?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.397
Let's put it this way. Condoleezza Rice

12:11.397 --> 12:13.315
is using her cock
more than I'm using mine.

12:13.315 --> 12:14.984
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

12:14.984 --> 12:16.777
- What is happening to us?
- I know.

12:16.777 --> 12:18.821
Not to me, actually.
I've been banging it out

12:18.821 --> 12:21.407
like a goddamn sledge hammer.
But you, Tommy, come on.

12:21.407 --> 12:22.491
I know.

12:22.491 --> 12:24.493
All right. We got to take
immediate action.

12:24.493 --> 12:26.662
We're gonna get you laid and get you laid.

12:26.662 --> 12:29.749
We'll get everybody laid.
Let's go on a Lotus field trip tonight.

12:29.749 --> 12:30.833
- Who's with me?
- I'm in.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.084
I don't know, Frank.

12:32.084 --> 12:35.045
You don't know? Jesus Christ,
what's not to know, okay?

12:35.045 --> 12:36.922
It's Lotus. Models, actresses.

12:36.922 --> 12:38.382
- Did I mention models?
- Mhm.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.468
- Sean?
- I'm in, but only as a wing man.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.553
- Team player.
- Got a girl. I don't wanna mess it up,

12:42.553 --> 12:44.889
but I'll go to be a team player.
Plus, there's models.

12:44.889 --> 12:46.348
Good man. Tom?

12:46.348 --> 12:48.642
Nah. Changed my mind.
Hey, Lou, you coming?

12:48.642 --> 12:49.935
Already booked us a table.

12:49.935 --> 12:52.021
Nine o'clock, assholes.

12:53.647 --> 12:56.442
All right, I got to talk to somebody.
It's killin' me.

12:56.442 --> 12:57.985
Why? What's goin' on?

12:57.985 --> 12:59.862
You know this girl I've been seein'?

12:59.862 --> 13:01.280
- Yeah.
- It's pretty serious.

13:01.989 --> 13:03.491
I think she might be the one.

13:04.158 --> 13:05.910
No shit. Who is she?

13:05.910 --> 13:07.787
Well, see, that's the problem.

13:08.412 --> 13:10.372
It's Maggie, Tommy's sister.

13:11.248 --> 13:13.000
- Get away from me.
- What? Why?

13:13.000 --> 13:15.920
I don't know you. I don't want
to know this information,

13:15.920 --> 13:18.464
'cause he'll come after me
once he's done you in.

13:18.464 --> 13:22.176
You think he's gonna be that upset?
We've been friends for like eight years.

13:22.176 --> 13:24.512
Years ago, a guy from 24 truck
grabbed Maggie's ass

13:24.512 --> 13:26.347
at a Christmas party. Grabbed her ass.

13:26.347 --> 13:29.141
The guy's got fake teeth
and a dent in his forehead now.

13:29.141 --> 13:30.559
Jesus, an actual dent?

13:30.559 --> 13:33.771
Yeah, well, they call it a dent.
It's actually more like a giant hole.

13:34.438 --> 13:35.523
Wow. Ow.

13:35.689 --> 13:39.026
Shit, Sean. Must be 5 million broads
in this city, you pick Tommy's sister?

13:39.026 --> 13:40.736
Not to mention she's insane.

13:40.736 --> 13:43.322
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- No, no, no, no, no. Brother,

13:43.322 --> 13:47.243
not insane like some kind of judgment.
Like the very serious mental disorder.

13:47.243 --> 13:48.327
She's a total wack job.

13:48.327 --> 13:51.664
I know, but that's... That's why
she's perfect for me, you know?

13:51.664 --> 13:54.667
It's why I became a firefighter.
I run into a burning building,

13:54.667 --> 13:57.586
my heart's beatin' a mile a minute.
I don't know if I'll get out alive.

13:57.586 --> 13:59.338
That's what it's like being with her.

13:59.338 --> 14:02.883
It's like she could snap at any minute
and, like, you know, take me out.

14:02.883 --> 14:04.927
It's really... She's dangerous.

14:04.927 --> 14:09.390
I like it. I'm gonna tell
Tommy what's goin' on. I gotta tell him.

14:09.390 --> 14:11.100
Here's your chance, champ. Good luck.

14:11.100 --> 14:14.061
Douchebag, hey, next time I find
your Scott pack in a seat

14:14.061 --> 14:17.606
where my ass belongs, you'll find
my Scott pack halfway up your colon.

14:20.067 --> 14:22.653
Okay, you know what?
Maybe I'll, uh, tell him later.

14:22.653 --> 14:25.322
- Yeah.
- Seems busy.

14:32.830 --> 14:35.207
- All right, all right.
- Thanks, baby.

14:35.207 --> 14:37.084
Who's gettin' this?
I thought it was Lou's round.

14:37.084 --> 14:39.336
Perfect time for him
to disappear. I'm tapped.

14:39.336 --> 14:40.754
- I got it, boys.
- Good man.

14:40.754 --> 14:43.007
There is plenty of talent
here tonight, boys.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.217
You can't make it here,
you can't make it anywhere.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.511
There's a dame that's been
checkin' us out all night.

14:47.511 --> 14:49.805
- Oh, yeah? Where?
- At the end of the bar.

14:51.765 --> 14:53.559
- Sexy.
- Very sexy.

14:53.559 --> 14:54.894
Ah, sure of herself.

14:54.894 --> 14:56.770
- Independent.
- Yep.

14:56.770 --> 14:58.314
With a great rack.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.691
I'm going over.

15:01.650 --> 15:04.028
You know,
she looks like my mom.

15:08.532 --> 15:09.783
What did you say?

15:09.783 --> 15:11.452
That lady reminds me of my mom.

15:11.452 --> 15:13.537
- Shit.
- Your mom is that hot?

15:13.537 --> 15:16.123
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I mean, hotter really.

15:16.123 --> 15:17.708
Your mom has that kind of face?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.668
Those lips? That kind of, uh, rack?

15:19.668 --> 15:22.588
Well, uh, my mom's rack
is a little bigger, actually.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.256
You know what? Where do you get off

15:24.423 --> 15:27.343
mentioning your mom and the word
"rack" in the same sentence?

15:27.343 --> 15:30.638
I'm just sayin', my mom,
she's got like a large set of,

15:30.638 --> 15:32.640
you know... She's really
in terms of the...

15:32.640 --> 15:35.351
- Enough! Jesus Christ.
- What?

15:35.351 --> 15:39.063
Goddamn it. I was... I was gonna
go over and talk to that chick.

15:39.063 --> 15:40.940
Let me qualify that
'cause she's not a chick.

15:40.940 --> 15:44.526
In a room full of self-involved,
young, titless little chicks,

15:44.526 --> 15:46.695
she's a woman, okay? A real woman.

15:46.695 --> 15:49.239
Probably a very, very witty
and wonderful woman.

15:49.239 --> 15:50.324
With a great rack.

15:50.324 --> 15:52.326
The rack was secondary. It doesn't matter,

15:52.326 --> 15:54.453
but I can't go over and talk to her now.

15:54.453 --> 15:57.164
- Well, why? Why not?
- Because even if I talked to her

15:57.164 --> 15:58.499
and got her home with me

15:58.499 --> 16:00.918
and got her to reveal
the aforementioned great rack,

16:00.918 --> 16:03.796
all I'd be thinkin' about
is how great your mom's rack is.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.632
I've never thought of it,
but that's all I can think of now.

16:06.632 --> 16:07.758
Your mom's rack!

16:07.758 --> 16:10.803
Whoa, hey. You know what?
My mom's married, pal, okay?

16:12.221 --> 16:13.722
Jesus.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.811
- What?
- Forbidden fruit, ball-face.

16:19.770 --> 16:21.105
You mean like melons?

16:23.232 --> 16:24.942
Yeah, hey. Hey, it's me.

16:25.943 --> 16:26.944
Your ex.

16:27.611 --> 16:29.947
Because you sounded like
you didn't know who...

16:29.947 --> 16:32.783
Listen, listen,
you know my father's watch,

16:32.783 --> 16:35.244
the gold watch that
they gave him? I need it.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.871
Well, because it's mine, that's why.

16:38.622 --> 16:41.166
Yeah, well, look, I realize that
that was the plan,

16:41.166 --> 16:43.669
but we never had a son,
so there's no one to pass it on to,

16:43.836 --> 16:44.920
so I want it back.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.298
I'm comin' over in the morning,

16:48.298 --> 16:49.425
and you give it to me,

16:49.425 --> 16:51.385
and I don't want any bullshit, okay?

16:51.385 --> 16:52.886
End of discussion!

16:54.596 --> 16:57.266
Oh, really? Oh, you're going
away for the weekend?

16:57.266 --> 16:58.684
Oh, it must be nice

16:58.684 --> 17:01.145
to be able to do that.
I want my watch!

17:03.897 --> 17:06.525
Jesus Christ, would somebody
please make a move?

17:06.525 --> 17:09.945
- I'm just watchin'.
- Yeah, Chief, that's the problem.

17:09.945 --> 17:11.363
We're all just watchin', okay?

17:11.363 --> 17:12.448
What's the probie doin'?

17:12.448 --> 17:15.159
Nine hundred pounds of fresh ass here,
he's talkin' to some dude.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.703
It's his friend Hank.
He went to school with him.

17:17.703 --> 17:18.996
Well, that's real sweet.

17:18.996 --> 17:21.457
Excuse me, guys. Do I know you?

17:21.457 --> 17:23.625
I'm sitting over there
with my friend, Gail.

17:23.625 --> 17:25.544
That's her over there. Hi, Gail. Anyway,

17:25.544 --> 17:27.421
I'm sitting there, I'm looking at you,

17:27.421 --> 17:30.340
and I'm thinking, "I know
this guy. I know I know him."

17:30.340 --> 17:31.884
How do I know you?

17:31.884 --> 17:33.844
Uh, maybe she's seen you on the news, Tom.

17:33.844 --> 17:35.429
Mmm! You're a reporter.

17:35.429 --> 17:37.765
No, no. I'm a... I'm a firefighter.

17:37.765 --> 17:40.100
Oh, like a real New York City firefighter?

17:40.100 --> 17:42.144
That's amazing, the job that you do.

17:42.144 --> 17:44.730
Yes, uh, Tommy Gavin.
Nice to meet you. How are you?

17:44.730 --> 17:48.567
Can I buy you a drink,
Tommy Gavin, firefighter, sir?

17:48.567 --> 17:51.779
Um, no, but I'll do you one better.
I'll buy you a drink.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.989
Okay.

17:53.989 --> 17:55.199
All right, after you.

17:56.909 --> 18:00.079
All right, if I'm not back in an hour,
forget about me.

18:00.788 --> 18:03.457
It's a total no-brainer.
I know a couple of other guys

18:03.457 --> 18:06.376
from our class. As soon as
we become regular firefighters,

18:06.376 --> 18:08.253
we're all transferring to other houses.

18:08.253 --> 18:11.423
Yeah, Hank, I don't know.
You know, the guys in my crew,

18:11.423 --> 18:13.425
they're like my family.

18:13.592 --> 18:16.637
Yeah, but, you don't live
with your family now, do you?

18:16.637 --> 18:20.057
In a couple of months, you're
not gonna be a probie anymore,

18:20.057 --> 18:22.101
but I guarantee you,
if you stay in your house,

18:22.101 --> 18:24.895
no matter what you do,
no matter how long you're there,

18:24.895 --> 18:26.855
you're always gonna be the probie.

18:26.855 --> 18:28.607
You gotta get out, Mike.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.402
Hey, where the hell did you take off to?

18:32.402 --> 18:35.531
Oh, Paris. The best place to
take a piss this time of night.

18:35.531 --> 18:36.990
Tommy found something?

18:36.990 --> 18:38.534
No, something found him,

18:38.534 --> 18:40.911
and it looks like
you have a secret admirer.

18:40.911 --> 18:43.122
- You ever seen Garrity's mom?
- Nope.

18:43.122 --> 18:44.414
Good luck and Godspeed.

18:46.708 --> 18:49.253
Wow. Thank God I took
the time to powder my balls

18:49.253 --> 18:51.338
before I left the house. How do I look?

18:51.338 --> 18:54.133
- Pretty drunk.
- Well, a little more might help.

18:55.467 --> 18:58.720
Ah! Oof. I'm good.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.478
Hi, there.

19:08.730 --> 19:13.068
I just, um, thought I'd, uh, come over
and introduce myself, you know.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.071
Let you know that it's okay, you know,

19:16.071 --> 19:18.782
that I kind of get checked out
by women all the time.

19:18.782 --> 19:22.286
'Cause as you may know or,
you know, may suspect,

19:22.286 --> 19:24.705
I'm, uh, with the FDNY, you know?

19:24.872 --> 19:28.417
America's heroes, blah, blah, blah.

19:28.417 --> 19:29.585
I'm, uh...

19:29.585 --> 19:32.462
I'm Lieutenant Ken Shea, at your service.

19:35.090 --> 19:36.466
And you are?

19:37.092 --> 19:40.929
Kenny, just go get the guy
in the black shirt for me, all right?

19:50.606 --> 19:52.065
She wants you.

19:55.444 --> 19:58.739
Me? Well, I'm young enough to be her...

20:02.409 --> 20:04.536
Well, hell, there's nothing else goin' on.

20:04.536 --> 20:07.664
Garrity, this doesn't work out,
your mother's tits are on deck.

20:07.664 --> 20:09.875
- That's not funny.
- Oh, it's funny.

20:10.417 --> 20:11.919
Uh, no, it's not.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.463
I always thought
the National Cheerleading finals

20:14.671 --> 20:16.590
would be the most
exciting night of my life,

20:16.590 --> 20:19.092
but here I am talking
with a real live firefighter,

20:19.092 --> 20:21.637
and suddenly, I can't even
remember a single cheer.

20:21.637 --> 20:23.931
How old are you? You're like 45, right?

20:23.931 --> 20:26.058
I'm guessing 44 or 45.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.685
I am really good at guessing
people's ages. I don't know why,

20:28.685 --> 20:31.688
but I can look at them,
and I'll be right within two years.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.942
You are, like 46, 48 tops. Tell me.

20:34.942 --> 20:36.401
Wait, wait, no, no, wait, wait.

20:36.985 --> 20:39.696
- I'm...
- You're 46! I knew it! Oh, I was right!

20:39.696 --> 20:42.741
Oh, my God, you're like
the same age as my dad.

20:42.741 --> 20:44.159
Why does that turn me on?

20:46.245 --> 20:49.414
My buddy just told me you wanted
me to come over and say hello,

20:49.414 --> 20:52.209
so that's what I'm doin'. Hi.

20:53.877 --> 20:56.255
Hi. Yeah.

20:56.880 --> 20:57.881
Nice meeting you.

20:59.049 --> 21:00.634
So you're intimidated.

21:00.634 --> 21:02.177
What? No.

21:02.177 --> 21:04.137
The thought of being with an older woman

21:04.137 --> 21:06.473
who knows exactly what she wants
what she gets,

21:06.473 --> 21:08.308
and she knows exactly how to keep it.

21:08.308 --> 21:10.686
I mean, that kind of
scares you a little bit, huh?

21:10.852 --> 21:12.938
I've really gotta get back to my buddies.

21:12.938 --> 21:15.941
Aren't you tired of girls?

21:15.941 --> 21:18.735
I mean, a guy like you, the way you look,

21:18.735 --> 21:21.989
I'm sure they're swarming
all over you like bees

21:21.989 --> 21:23.490
to a blossom, huh?

21:23.490 --> 21:25.242
Yeah.

21:25.409 --> 21:29.079
But you're not really happy, are you?

21:29.079 --> 21:30.998
I mean, in bed.

21:31.164 --> 21:34.751
Of course, maybe, but afterwards,

21:34.751 --> 21:37.504
when you go to talk to them

21:37.671 --> 21:39.715
or you see them with unclouded eyes,

21:39.715 --> 21:42.009
then you realize
they're just made of paper,

21:42.009 --> 21:45.304
and the only sound they really
make is just the crinkle

21:45.304 --> 21:47.848
when you ball them up
and you toss them aside.

21:50.017 --> 21:53.979
Don't you think you deserve a woman
who's made of more than paper?

21:54.688 --> 21:55.981
Uh...

21:55.981 --> 21:58.567
I have business in Milan.

21:58.567 --> 22:00.569
I'm leaving on Monday,

22:00.736 --> 22:05.991
which gives us an entire weekend
full of possibilities, doesn't it?

22:06.158 --> 22:07.659
Oh, yeah.

22:21.590 --> 22:22.674
Be safe.

22:31.308 --> 22:34.853
Think she still uses
a rotary phone? Joking.

22:38.565 --> 22:40.359
All right, so I gotta get goin'.

22:40.359 --> 22:43.362
That's one extremely hot piece of ass
you caught, my friend.

22:43.362 --> 22:44.571
I expect a full report.

22:44.571 --> 22:45.697
You got it.

22:47.657 --> 22:49.868
So, I'll, uh, see ya.

22:50.035 --> 22:52.621
Uh, what's wrong, Tom?

22:52.621 --> 22:55.207
- She talks a lot.
- Oh.

22:55.207 --> 22:56.708
I mean, like a real lot.

22:56.708 --> 22:58.627
In the course of the last half-hour,

22:58.627 --> 23:00.962
she's said more than
most people say in a week.

23:00.962 --> 23:03.632
I actually thought I saw
sparks comin' off her tongue.

23:03.632 --> 23:05.884
Well, you know,
she's probably just nervous.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.095
You know, meetin' a firefighter and all.

23:08.095 --> 23:09.930
- Right.
- Yeah. It'll be fine, man.

23:09.930 --> 23:11.014
All right. See ya.

23:13.934 --> 23:15.727
I like a man who drives a truck.

23:15.727 --> 23:18.105
People say that a man's
vehicle's connected to the way

23:18.105 --> 23:21.233
they feel about the size of their penis,
but I totally don't buy that.

23:21.233 --> 23:24.861
I've been with guys who are well-hung,
and they drove these sports cars.

23:24.861 --> 23:28.490
I was with this guy who drove a Hummer
and his penis was like a roll of dimes.

23:28.490 --> 23:30.909
Maybe there is something to it.
I don't know.

23:30.909 --> 23:34.704
It's silliness anyway. I'm sure you'll
prove the theory wrong, no pressure.

23:34.704 --> 23:37.124
My father's like,
"If you want to be an actress,

23:37.124 --> 23:41.128
"that's all good, but there is no way
that you're gonna live in some shithole."

23:41.128 --> 23:43.338
He found me this apartment,
which was nice.

23:43.338 --> 23:46.133
I was like, "Daddy, you're not
gonna pay for the whole thing

23:46.133 --> 23:49.886
"because I need to be an independent
person and responsible for myself."

23:49.886 --> 23:52.931
So I pay 300 a month,
and he pays the other 2,200.

23:56.226 --> 23:58.061
Did you see my floors when we walked in?

23:58.061 --> 24:00.480
I just got them redone
and there's paint on them.

24:00.480 --> 24:04.568
I told them it was my new floors,
to put down paper or tape or something,

24:04.568 --> 24:07.446
and it's there, and I must've
told them like a million times.

24:07.446 --> 24:10.407
What do I do? I mean,
I called them and they wouldn't...

24:13.118 --> 24:14.119
Oh...

24:14.744 --> 24:15.871
Oh, my God.

24:16.538 --> 24:18.915
Oh, my God. You... This is so good.

24:18.915 --> 24:20.750
You are really good at this.

24:23.545 --> 24:27.883
You know, most guys, they get down there,
and it's like they need a map printed out.

24:27.883 --> 24:30.635
They need it tattooed on
your inner thigh or something.

24:30.635 --> 24:32.637
It's like, come on. They need an arrow

24:32.637 --> 24:35.682
that says "Put tongue here."
Why did you stop? What's wrong?

24:36.975 --> 24:38.101
Oh, you're thirsty.

24:38.101 --> 24:40.896
Oh, there's vodka in the freezer
or beer in the fridge,

24:40.896 --> 24:43.773
unless you want water. I have
a filter thingy on the tap,

24:43.773 --> 24:46.735
which I don't know why because
all the reports say that New York

24:46.735 --> 24:48.987
has the freshest,
cleanest drinking water ever.

24:48.987 --> 24:51.114
Ooh, you naughty boy. Tape!

24:54.201 --> 24:56.870
All right, girls, day out with Dad.
Buy whatever you want.

24:56.870 --> 24:59.372
- Food, clothes, CDs.
- Why?

24:59.372 --> 25:03.502
What do you mean, why? 'Cause
I want to do something nice for my girls.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.505
- Why?
- I want to buy Grandpa a birthday present.

25:06.505 --> 25:09.883
See? Your sister's in the spirit.
Why can't you come along for the ride?

25:09.883 --> 25:12.010
Well, I don't know. I know you, maybe.

25:12.010 --> 25:14.846
You're trying to mess with Mom,
or you've been drinking.

25:14.846 --> 25:19.142
I'm not trying
to mess with Mom. Unbelievable.

25:19.142 --> 25:22.938
You can't be nice to people without...
Here. There's 300 bucks.

25:23.396 --> 25:24.856
- Wow.
- Yeah.

25:24.856 --> 25:27.943
Go buy whatever you want. Meet
us here in half an hour, okay?

25:27.943 --> 25:30.278
Half an hour? I'll only be able
to try on one...

25:30.278 --> 25:32.405
All right, an hour. An hour. All right?

25:32.405 --> 25:33.615
- Okay.
- Don't be late.

25:33.615 --> 25:34.741
Okay. Thanks.

25:34.741 --> 25:36.743
Jeez. Unbelievable.

25:36.743 --> 25:38.578
All right, kiddo. What do you want?

25:38.578 --> 25:39.663
Ice cream.

25:40.205 --> 25:42.415
Honey, it's like...
It's like 14 degrees out.

25:42.415 --> 25:47.003
It's 14 degrees out here,
but in my stomach, it's the 4th of July.

25:47.170 --> 25:49.047
Okay. Ice cream.

25:49.548 --> 25:50.632
Come in. You have company.

25:50.632 --> 25:52.634
No, leave that. come with me. Say hello.

25:53.218 --> 25:55.720
Come on. Look who's here.

25:57.097 --> 25:58.139
Hi, babe.

25:58.139 --> 26:01.810
Bud, what a nice surprise.
Give me a kiss.

26:02.852 --> 26:04.604
- Oh...
- At least I'm still Bud.

26:06.064 --> 26:08.984
Olivia, this is
my brother Bud from Arizona.

26:09.901 --> 26:11.611
He lived out there 20 years ago.

26:11.611 --> 26:13.029
He's back in the area now.

26:13.196 --> 26:16.866
How far do you have to come
to see me? It's too far.

26:16.866 --> 26:20.412
Uh, there's something I want to talk
to you about. Give us a minute, huh?

26:20.412 --> 26:23.456
Sure. Jeannie, make sure
you show him your art.

26:23.456 --> 26:26.751
Oh, Bud, look at what I made.

26:27.377 --> 26:30.380
Aren't they glorious? I made these.

26:30.380 --> 26:31.506
Wow.

26:31.506 --> 26:33.717
I learned how in one of my classes.

26:35.093 --> 26:37.679
This is the best school in the world.

26:38.138 --> 26:42.475
The teachers, the students,
everyone is so nice

26:42.642 --> 26:44.644
and they seem to like me.

26:45.270 --> 26:48.106
They love you. Everybody loves you.

26:48.898 --> 26:51.693
Look, Jeannie, as nice as this place is,

26:51.693 --> 26:55.071
I was thinking it's a little bit
far away from home,

26:55.071 --> 26:57.699
and, well, I have some brochures here.

26:57.699 --> 26:59.993
There are places just as nice as this.

26:59.993 --> 27:03.872
And look, it has a lake, they have a pool,
they have aqua aerobics.

27:03.872 --> 27:06.583
- So many activities and you'd really...
- I would die.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.671
If you made me leave here...

27:13.173 --> 27:14.257
I would die.

27:16.009 --> 27:17.719
I love everyone here.

27:19.304 --> 27:22.057
And they love me.
You just said so yourself.

27:22.807 --> 27:23.892
Yeah, but...

27:23.892 --> 27:25.602
Don't make me go.

27:25.602 --> 27:28.146
- Please, Bud, you...
- Okay. Okay.

27:28.271 --> 27:29.606
Please don't.

27:29.606 --> 27:31.524
Okay. All right.

27:32.108 --> 27:33.818
We'll work it out. Hmm?

27:35.070 --> 27:36.529
Okay, we'll work it out.

28:20.073 --> 28:21.408
Shit.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.166
All right, kiddo, now what?

28:30.834 --> 28:32.043
I'm still hungry.

28:32.043 --> 28:34.754
Is your mother not feeding you?
Is that what's going on?

28:34.754 --> 28:36.589
She says I'm having a growth spurt.

28:36.589 --> 28:39.008
- I guess so.
- There's a place on the next block.

28:39.008 --> 28:40.927
They have fries with chili and cheese.

28:40.927 --> 28:42.011
Honey...

28:42.011 --> 28:45.098
Uncle Teddy took me once. I want some.

28:45.098 --> 28:50.103
All right. That's gonna sit real well
after a triple scoop of rocky road.

28:50.270 --> 28:52.731
Oh, God, babe. That was incredible.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.190
What do you got, a drink?

28:54.774 --> 28:58.528
You know what they say, nothing like
a little cocktail after a little cock.

28:58.903 --> 29:00.613
Not that your cock is little.

29:00.613 --> 29:03.616
Oh, that's very funny, 'cause I was
gonna start crying, you know.

29:03.616 --> 29:05.702
- Seriously, what is that?
- It's a Manhattan.

29:05.702 --> 29:07.954
I'm going through a retro phase
with my booze.

29:07.954 --> 29:09.414
My mother used to drink those.

29:09.414 --> 29:11.374
She used to let me, uh, have the cherry.

29:11.374 --> 29:13.752
Ooh, can I have your cherry?

29:13.918 --> 29:17.255
You know, you really look like a retard
when you make that face.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.381
What? Sorry.

29:18.381 --> 29:20.884
If you knew me, you'd know
I never put fruit in drinks.

29:20.884 --> 29:24.095
Cherries are for pies, slot machines,
and virgins. You see those around?

29:24.095 --> 29:25.847
No, I sure don't. Come here.

29:25.847 --> 29:28.892
Hey, you make me spill
and I'll slit your goddamn throat.

29:28.892 --> 29:31.644
All right. Hey, uh, you know what?

29:31.644 --> 29:34.272
- Tonight at, uh, at the party...
- Yes.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.065
We gotta be really careful, you know,

29:36.065 --> 29:40.028
I mean, like we shouldn't touch each other
or barely look at each other, you know?

29:40.028 --> 29:42.113
Yeah. If Tommy finds out,
he'll shit melons.

29:42.238 --> 29:45.617
Yeah. I mean, but if he did
find out, it wouldn't be

29:45.617 --> 29:47.952
that bad, right? It's like he knows me,

29:47.952 --> 29:49.829
and you know,
it's not like I'm a stranger.

29:49.829 --> 29:51.623
No, Sean, it makes it worse.

29:51.623 --> 29:53.208
Once I dated this guy,

29:53.208 --> 29:55.335
he was a friend
of Tommy's from high school,

29:55.335 --> 29:58.087
only the guy didn't tell Tommy
he was seeing me.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.380
Tommy killed him.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.342
He did not.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.719
They found the guy strung up
in his parents' garage.

30:05.762 --> 30:08.014
So that's a... That's a suicide, right?

30:08.765 --> 30:11.100
Well, that's what
Tommy wanted it to look like.

30:12.018 --> 30:15.563
Oh... Yeah. Maybe we should be careful.

30:15.563 --> 30:17.273
- Yeah. No shit.
- Yeah.

30:17.273 --> 30:19.567
You want to do that thing
that we did before?

30:19.567 --> 30:21.444
You mean where I smoke and we make out?

30:21.444 --> 30:23.363
Yeah, man, I really need it.

30:23.822 --> 30:24.823
Give it to me.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.203
All right, there, buddy.

30:33.665 --> 30:35.708
So how'd you manage this, Ken?

30:37.210 --> 30:40.046
I was breaking into my ex-wife's
to steal a watch

30:40.046 --> 30:44.509
that belonged to my father
so I could pawn it to get money.

30:47.220 --> 30:48.429
How'd you really do it?

30:50.390 --> 30:51.891
Broke a glass in the sink.

30:51.891 --> 30:54.894
You know, I really
shouldn't be doing this.

30:54.894 --> 30:56.104
Why not? You're a doctor.

30:56.104 --> 30:57.522
I'm a veterinarian.

30:57.522 --> 31:00.024
Well, you used to be a real doctor.

31:00.024 --> 31:02.777
Watch that. How would you
like to be sewn up crooked?

31:02.777 --> 31:03.945
Sorry.

31:04.612 --> 31:05.822
So how you doin'?

31:07.448 --> 31:10.827
I was sittin' out in my car,
you know, just bleeding,

31:11.744 --> 31:12.871
and I thought...

31:13.955 --> 31:16.291
why not just let nature take its course?

31:17.000 --> 31:19.252
It's supposed to be
a peaceful death, isn't it?

31:20.628 --> 31:23.172
Now here I am gettin' fixed up by you.

31:25.341 --> 31:26.384
For what?

31:28.636 --> 31:31.764
I mean, I lost every cent I ever had.
I got nobody in my life.

31:31.764 --> 31:34.851
I'm out drinking every night
'cause I don't want to go home

31:34.851 --> 31:36.978
to the goddamn rat hole that I live in.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.062
So...

31:40.064 --> 31:42.442
So why didn't
I just stay in the car?

31:43.818 --> 31:46.112
God, Ken, you've got
to come over more often.

31:46.946 --> 31:48.406
You're a hoot.

31:57.206 --> 31:59.959
Oh, God, honey. Yeah,
we're still on the pizza.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.170
When will it be over?

32:02.170 --> 32:04.672
About five minutes after
we get to the ice cream.

32:04.672 --> 32:07.550
Hold your head. Yeah, there
you go. Perfect. All right.

32:09.010 --> 32:11.429
- What's that?
- Miniskirt I bought.

32:11.429 --> 32:13.306
- I hope you paid half price.
- Why?

32:13.306 --> 32:15.433
'Cause you got half
a skirt. It's going back.

32:15.433 --> 32:17.018
- No way.
- It's going back.

32:17.018 --> 32:19.646
- Why?
- I'll tell you why. Because easy access.

32:19.646 --> 32:22.815
Every boy at school's gonna be droppin'
his pencils every time

32:22.815 --> 32:24.275
he sees you walkin'. It's goin' back.

32:24.275 --> 32:26.903
That's good, sweetheart.

32:26.903 --> 32:29.906
We're all the way to the chili
cheese fries now. Good job.

32:29.906 --> 32:31.616
Dad, I'm not interested in boys.

32:31.616 --> 32:34.202
Okay, I know that,
but lesbians pull the same tricks,

32:34.202 --> 32:35.745
okay? It's goin' back.

32:35.745 --> 32:38.748
Ever since I turned my life
over to the lord Jesus Christ,

32:38.748 --> 32:42.377
- my entire outlook on, like...
- Did you just... What? What did you say?

32:42.377 --> 32:44.170
I'm a born-again Christian.

32:44.170 --> 32:45.254
Bullshit.

32:45.254 --> 32:46.756
- I am.
- Not in my house.

32:46.756 --> 32:49.842
It's the hot new thing at school.
All my friends are born-again.

32:49.842 --> 32:52.470
I thought the hot new thing
in school was blow jobs.

32:52.470 --> 32:54.597
- Blow jobs are so last year, Dad.
- Shh!

32:54.597 --> 32:56.516
- Catch up.
- What's blow jobs?

32:56.516 --> 33:00.395
Uh, nothing, honey. It's
a haircut thing. Don't worry about it.

33:03.606 --> 33:06.150
Oh. No ice cream, goddamn it.

33:06.150 --> 33:08.736
So what... what's the deal with
these born-again people?

33:08.736 --> 33:11.030
Well, it means that I accept
Jesus Christ...

33:11.030 --> 33:12.865
I know that part. I'm talkin' about,

33:12.865 --> 33:14.909
you know, when it comes to... sex.

33:14.909 --> 33:15.994
What?

33:17.078 --> 33:19.539
When it comes to, you know, sex.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.624
Oh, um, no sex until marriage.

33:21.624 --> 33:23.751
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.253
Cool. I'm in.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.172
But, wait, don't you want to know about...

33:28.172 --> 33:29.424
No, no, I'm good. I'm good.

33:29.424 --> 33:32.468
And one other thing. Um,
who's your mom dating?

33:32.468 --> 33:33.928
I can't tell you.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.889
Pretty sure
there's a thing in the Bible

33:36.889 --> 33:40.685
where Jesus says that you should honor
your father and your mother, right?

33:40.685 --> 33:43.396
I think Jesus wants you to tell me
who your mom's seein'.

33:43.396 --> 33:46.399
Yeah, but if I tell you,
I'll be dishonoring her,

33:46.399 --> 33:48.151
- so I really can't.
- Uh-huh.

33:48.151 --> 33:51.154
What about all the stuff I gave
you the money to buy today?

33:51.154 --> 33:53.906
Dad, when you want information,
you ask first,

33:53.906 --> 33:55.366
then you offer the bribe.

33:55.366 --> 33:57.952
That's how it works.
You did it the wrong way around.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.912
Duh, I know. I was trying to be nice.

33:59.912 --> 34:02.707
Oh, and by the way, you're gonna
have to give me another hundred

34:02.707 --> 34:05.084
to keep me from telling Mom
about you getting Katy sick.

34:05.084 --> 34:07.211
Dream on. I'm not giving you another dime.

34:07.211 --> 34:10.423
- Them I'm calling her right now.
- Go ahead. See if I care.

34:13.593 --> 34:14.844
Aw, all right!

34:17.013 --> 34:18.681
Call yourself a Christian.

34:19.098 --> 34:20.475
Unbelievable.

34:24.312 --> 34:25.855
Yay. Ice cream.

34:27.774 --> 34:31.444
He used to bring us here
when we were kids. Nothing has changed.

34:31.444 --> 34:34.947
I think it's the same wait staff,
you know, same chairs.

34:34.947 --> 34:38.451
See that brown stain? I think that's
where I dropped some ribs when I was nine.

34:39.660 --> 34:41.162
- Yeah, it's hideous.
- Yeah.

34:41.162 --> 34:44.499
I tried to talk him into someplace nice,
but you know your father.

34:44.499 --> 34:48.586
Chinks, chinks, chinks.
Ooh, not you, the food.

34:52.381 --> 34:55.927
Oh, look at Damian. He hates me.
He so did not want to come here today.

34:55.927 --> 34:58.179
- Why?
- Well, because he wanted to invite

34:58.179 --> 35:00.264
- his teacher, Miss Turbody, and I said no.
- What?

35:00.264 --> 35:02.892
- I know, that's weird, right?
- That's insane. Retarded.

35:02.892 --> 35:06.562
I mean, I'm glad he likes her,
but he's like really into her.

35:07.230 --> 35:10.149
- Should I be worried about it?
- You should say something. That's...

35:10.149 --> 35:11.859
That's crazy.

35:11.859 --> 35:15.113
Oh, I gotta go check on the cake.
They wouldn't let us bring our own in.

35:15.113 --> 35:16.572
- They had to make it.
- Yeah?

35:16.572 --> 35:18.741
It's probably gonna be
a gigantic fortune cookie

35:18.741 --> 35:21.285
with a bunch of sweet and sour
gook stuffed in it.

35:21.702 --> 35:24.914
Oh, not you... The cake.

35:27.875 --> 35:29.919
They're gonna poison us all.

35:29.919 --> 35:31.170
Oh, yeah.

35:31.170 --> 35:33.840
Oh, goody. Princess Janet is here.

35:34.173 --> 35:35.716
Party can officially start.

35:40.805 --> 35:42.265
- Hey.
- How you doin'?

35:42.265 --> 35:44.433
- Pretty good. Janet looks great.
- Hmm.

35:44.433 --> 35:46.853
- How you two doin'?
- Oh, fantastic.

35:47.270 --> 35:49.605
She's, uh, at least
not goin' the lawyer route,

35:49.605 --> 35:52.567
so I'll save money that way,
but she doesn't even talk to me,

35:52.567 --> 35:54.485
so, I mean, I have to go through Johnny

35:54.485 --> 35:56.863
- to arrange the kids and everything.
- Yeah.

35:57.446 --> 35:59.240
Maggie looks good, though, huh?

35:59.240 --> 36:00.825
Oh, yeah. Real good.

36:02.577 --> 36:04.120
She looks nice. Yeah.

36:04.120 --> 36:05.705
What's with the probie?

36:05.705 --> 36:08.416
The probie?
Oh, yeah. Me and Mike, uh,

36:08.416 --> 36:11.169
basically, I'm doin' a bit of matchmaking.
We were at the club

36:11.169 --> 36:13.754
talkin' to these two dancer chicks.
I sealed the deal with my girl,

36:13.754 --> 36:15.840
but probie was like totally not into it.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.718
And this girl had a sign
on her forehead that said, "Nail me."

36:18.718 --> 36:21.554
I promised my chick I'd hook
'em up tonight, which I did.

36:21.554 --> 36:23.431
- And how was your chick?
- She's okay.

36:23.431 --> 36:25.057
Kind of girl I call a firecracker.

36:25.057 --> 36:27.768
She's got like one good bang in her.
That's about it.

36:29.478 --> 36:31.814
What happened to your hand?
You cut yourself shaving?

36:31.814 --> 36:33.816
I broke a glass in the sink.

36:33.816 --> 36:36.444
Listen, three of us have
got to stick together, right?

36:36.444 --> 36:39.030
- The three losers who couldn't get a date.
- Right.

36:39.030 --> 36:40.364
You're seein' somebody, right?

36:40.364 --> 36:42.700
- No. Uh-uh.
- You are, right?

36:42.700 --> 36:46.495
Yeah, yeah. I mean, nobody...
Nobody here, but I am.

36:46.495 --> 36:50.499
I'm seeing someone, who's, uh...
She's someplace else tonight.

36:51.500 --> 36:53.336
I... I gotta pee.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.463
I'll just...

36:55.630 --> 36:58.549
I think he's dating somebody here. You?

36:59.634 --> 37:03.262
I just said I wasn't dating
anybody here or anyplace else.

37:07.725 --> 37:10.770
Oh... This is gonna be a lot
more fun than I thought.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.314
- Hey.
- Hey.

37:13.481 --> 37:15.066
- Club soda?
- Club soda.

37:15.233 --> 37:17.026
I feel my liver twitching.

37:17.026 --> 37:18.945
Yeah, well, this is where it happens.

37:18.945 --> 37:22.657
Most people who screw up in the program,
this is the kind of thing that does it.

37:22.782 --> 37:25.534
You can go through all
this trauma, pain, lose a kid,

37:25.534 --> 37:27.578
stay straight as a goddamn arrow.

37:27.745 --> 37:29.205
An innocent family get-together,

37:29.205 --> 37:32.291
you know, a little
birthday party, wham. Simple.

37:33.417 --> 37:36.712
It's, you know, perfect
combination of accessible booze,

37:36.712 --> 37:38.297
a little repressed hostility.

37:39.632 --> 37:40.841
How do you handle it?

37:41.342 --> 37:42.468
I smoke a ton of weed.

37:47.098 --> 37:48.182
Asshole.

37:51.143 --> 37:54.605
The birthday boy wants
everyone to know, dinner is served!

37:54.605 --> 37:56.649
Oh, dinner is served. The birthday boy...

38:06.450 --> 38:09.662
Hey, honey, you ate
hardly anything at all.

38:09.662 --> 38:12.748
Why don't you try some
of this spicy orange chicken?

38:17.837 --> 38:20.131
- What'd I do?
- It's okay, Grandpa.

38:20.131 --> 38:22.300
Did I tell you how much Jesus loves you?

38:22.300 --> 38:26.637
Yeah, a couple of times.
Tell Jesus to lay off, will ya?

38:27.263 --> 38:30.891
You know, I'm glad he loves me,
but that's how rumors get started.

38:49.452 --> 38:50.953
Here comes the cake!

38:53.664 --> 38:55.499
- Happy birth...
- Shut your hole!

38:56.083 --> 38:58.002
Now, I'm warning all of you right now,

38:58.002 --> 39:01.380
anyone who comes up with that
happy birthday bullshit,

39:01.380 --> 39:02.757
I'm dropping my pants,

39:02.757 --> 39:04.258
taking a leak on this cake,

39:04.258 --> 39:06.052
and walkin' the hell out of here.

39:06.052 --> 39:07.595
All right, everybody, on three.

39:08.679 --> 39:10.264
Give us some wisdom, Dad. Come on.

39:10.264 --> 39:12.016
All right, seriously.

39:13.059 --> 39:15.102
I never expected to live this long.

39:15.102 --> 39:18.022
Thought maybe the Nazis
would get me, or the gooks.

39:19.148 --> 39:20.900
Oh, not you. The Japanese.

39:20.900 --> 39:22.777
And we know how that turned out.

39:22.777 --> 39:24.111
Sixteen kills...

39:24.111 --> 39:25.780
No maybes.

39:25.780 --> 39:29.033
And here I am.
You get older, you get wiser.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.160
And if you're not a complete moron,

39:31.160 --> 39:34.121
you start to see things
the way they really are.

39:34.121 --> 39:36.540
And I'm seeing the way things are goin',

39:36.540 --> 39:42.171
this is probably the last birthday cake
I'll have my name on.

39:43.881 --> 39:46.258
Hell, I wanted this to be funny.

39:46.675 --> 39:47.885
Let's have cake.

39:47.885 --> 39:49.720
Cake, yay!

39:49.720 --> 39:51.263
Hear, hear.

40:40.646 --> 40:41.856
Daddy?

40:44.567 --> 40:46.986
My stomach hurts.

41:26.901 --> 41:30.529
Tommy! Tommy!
Break it up! Break it up!

41:30.529 --> 41:31.906
Hey, knock it off!

41:32.072 --> 41:33.908
- Cut it out! Come on, Tommy!
- Tom!

41:33.908 --> 41:35.242
Tommy!

41:35.242 --> 41:37.077
Son of a bitch, Tommy, cut it out!

41:37.077 --> 41:38.245
On my birthday.

41:38.245 --> 41:39.455
Stop it now!

41:40.080 --> 41:41.499
Come on now, that's enough!

41:41.499 --> 41:42.958
That's enough!

41:43.417 --> 41:45.002
Goddamn it! Get off me!

41:45.002 --> 41:46.086
Take it easy.

41:46.086 --> 41:47.338
Tommy! Tom, Tommy!

41:49.673 --> 41:50.674
Tommy!

41:51.675 --> 41:52.968
Hey, hey, Tommy! Hey, Tom!

41:54.261 --> 41:56.013
Hey, Tommy. Get him. Come on.

41:56.555 --> 41:58.849
- Calm down.
- Come on, Tommy!

41:58.849 --> 42:00.976
- Let him go, let him go.
- Stop it!

42:05.481 --> 42:07.983
Stop it! Come on, Tommy, enough, huh?

42:31.507 --> 42:35.636
<i>There was a rapture</i>

42:36.845 --> 42:41.892
<i>So I can never see you any more</i>

and beg for more</i>

43:59.970 --> 44:06.143
<i>- Not saying it's easier
- Not saying it's easier</i>

44:06.143 --> 44:11.148
<i>To live your life like her little whore</i>

44:11.315 --> 44:17.071
<i>'Cause when you play with fire</i>

44:17.071 --> 44:22.368
<i>Take your fate, it's not going away</i>
