00:11.072 --> 00:15.080
Tonight, Cameron Diaz in
our reasonably priced car.

00:15.115 --> 00:19.088
I repeat, Cameron Diaz in
our reasonably priced car.

00:19.123 --> 00:22.569
Sorry, Stig, totally
BLEEPing it up!

00:22.604 --> 00:26.016
And she's brought Tom Cruise along!

00:33.052 --> 00:34.564
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

00:34.599 --> 00:36.333
Hello and welcome!

00:36.368 --> 00:38.068
That is later.

00:39.092 --> 00:40.550
That is later.

00:40.585 --> 00:41.973
But now...

00:42.008 --> 00:45.017
we start once again with a letter.

00:45.052 --> 00:49.044
It's from some Swedish youths
and it says, "Dear Top Gear,

00:49.079 --> 00:51.989
"we are some Swedish youths,

00:52.024 --> 00:55.076
"and we've been given the
run of a whole ski resort

00:55.111 --> 00:56.989
"for a weekend.

00:57.024 --> 00:59.064
"Do you a race fancy having?"

01:01.064 --> 01:04.060
Plainly this was a job
for Richard Herring.

01:08.008 --> 01:10.025
This is Riksgransen,

01:10.060 --> 01:13.542
the world's
northernmost ski resort.

01:13.577 --> 01:16.989
120 miles INSIDE the Arctic Circle.

01:17.024 --> 01:22.020
It's so far north that the ski season
doesn't finish here until June,

01:22.055 --> 01:24.969
when the rest of us
are on the beach.

01:25.004 --> 01:29.020
I'm here to defend the honour of the
car against some extreme snowmobilers

01:29.055 --> 01:32.061
who are so extreme they're...
still in bed.

01:32.096 --> 01:36.036
Still, meanwhile, let's meet the car
I've chosen to take them on with.

01:40.088 --> 01:43.017
It's the Volkswagen Touareg.

01:43.052 --> 01:48.064
A big off-roader that for many
years we've... absolutely hated.

01:48.099 --> 01:51.064
We tested it when it first
came out, seven years ago.

01:51.099 --> 01:54.009
And we didn't like a
lot of things about it.

01:54.044 --> 01:59.052
The ride, the gearbox, the fact
you couldn't see out of the back.

01:59.087 --> 02:01.037
We didn't like the
ridiculous thirst,

02:01.072 --> 02:04.040
and we didn't like that
some of the design felt like

02:04.075 --> 02:06.096
they'd done the most
un-German thing possible.

02:06.131 --> 02:08.056
A half-arsed job.

02:13.004 --> 02:15.005
But this is the brand new Touareg.

02:15.040 --> 02:18.024
And already I can report
many improvements.

02:18.059 --> 02:21.008
You can, for instance,
see out of the back.

02:22.052 --> 02:24.017
The ride is much smoother.

02:24.052 --> 02:28.040
The gearbox, the old one changed
according to a geological timescale.

02:28.075 --> 02:30.052
This new eight-speed affair

02:30.087 --> 02:31.096
is a big improvement.

02:35.040 --> 02:38.092
The Touareg also looks more
Golf-like than the old one.

02:38.127 --> 02:41.005
And besides the full
off-road hardware,

02:41.040 --> 02:45.040
standard kit includes sat-nav,
electric leather seats,

02:45.075 --> 02:50.012
climate control, and a
ten-speaker stereo system.

02:51.072 --> 02:53.061
But we've come here to race

02:53.096 --> 02:56.064
so none of that is
important right now.

02:56.099 --> 02:59.075
What is important is
that the new Touareg

02:59.110 --> 03:02.052
weighs 200 kilograms
less than the old one.

03:04.000 --> 03:06.040
Which makes it altogether
more sprightly.

03:07.048 --> 03:10.048
This is a 3.5 litre
V6 turbo diesel.

03:10.083 --> 03:12.033
Cost, L37,000,

03:12.068 --> 03:14.977
0 to 60 in 7.8 seconds,

03:15.012 --> 03:17.048
so it's faster than the old one.

03:17.083 --> 03:18.057
Top speed, 136 mph.

03:18.092 --> 03:21.000
So you're better off there, too.

03:23.000 --> 03:26.096
All in all, I think this is the
machine to take the snowmobilers on

03:26.131 --> 03:28.049
in our big race.

03:28.084 --> 03:31.044
Which, as they're still in
bed playing computer games,

03:31.079 --> 03:32.088
will happen tomorrow.

03:34.000 --> 03:40.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:41.032 --> 03:42.045
So, race day.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.024
And I'll confess, I
went to bed last night

03:45.059 --> 03:46.025
full of confidence.

03:46.060 --> 03:50.064
And then, in the middle of the night,
I sort of got cold feet about it.

03:50.099 --> 03:54.080
So I got up, got dressed, came
downstairs, and I made... this.

03:57.024 --> 03:58.965
It's still a Touareg.

03:59.000 --> 04:02.028
But one built to take
on the infamous Dakar.

04:02.063 --> 04:03.981
The toughest rally in the world.

04:04.016 --> 04:07.546
With a carbon fibre
body, bionic suspension,

04:07.581 --> 04:11.830
and a twin-turbo, 300
horsepower, diesel engine,

04:11.865 --> 04:16.450
it can do 130 mph over
just about any terrain.

04:16.485 --> 04:20.286
It's also the first diesel
ever to win the Dakar.

04:20.321 --> 04:24.088
Which is odd, given that I
built it only last night.

04:26.048 --> 04:29.072
But no matter, I think this
is probably the better tool

04:29.107 --> 04:31.024
to see off those snowmobilers,

04:31.059 --> 04:33.032
who have finally emerged.

04:36.068 --> 04:39.064
They are Daniel Bodin and Dan Lang.

04:39.099 --> 04:40.049
Local snowmobile legends

04:40.084 --> 04:45.052
whose racing skills have won them
silver medals at the X-Games.

04:48.088 --> 04:51.092
Best let them get it
out of their system.

04:54.004 --> 04:56.024
'Eventually the teenagers
calm down long enough

04:56.059 --> 04:58.044
'for me to explain the race route

04:58.079 --> 05:00.977
'across the ski resort. '

05:01.012 --> 05:02.981
Right, we're going
to start from here.

05:03.016 --> 05:05.088
Then we're going to move around
here, sweep around there,

05:05.123 --> 05:07.092
down there, then
eventually we'll finish

05:07.127 --> 05:09.591
with a sprint across the ice lake,

05:09.626 --> 05:12.056
end up, finish line,
at the ski shop.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.080
So, that's 12 gruelling
miles down ski slopes,

05:16.115 --> 05:20.052
through forests, and
across frozen water.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.021
Yeah? Happy?

05:23.056 --> 05:25.560
Yeah. Fine with that. OK. Good.

05:25.595 --> 05:28.064
Um... where is here, exactly?

05:28.099 --> 05:30.036
It's up there.

05:37.048 --> 05:39.056
Oooh. Yeah!

05:39.091 --> 05:41.029
ENGINES REV

05:41.064 --> 05:43.008
All right. Fair enough.

05:46.040 --> 05:50.016
Ooh, erm, I guess, 3...
2... 1... go?

06:00.036 --> 06:01.040
Right, come on.

06:02.036 --> 06:04.993
0 to 60 in this, about six seconds.

06:05.028 --> 06:10.028
This thing has more torque
than a Lamborghini Gallardo.

06:10.063 --> 06:11.072
Have they got that? No!

06:15.028 --> 06:18.044
'We plunged out of the
clouds neck and neck. '

06:21.012 --> 06:25.004
I have taken the precaution of
fitting it with studded snow tyres.

06:25.039 --> 06:26.096
Obviously I did that.

06:32.008 --> 06:34.024
Come on! Find grip!

06:36.040 --> 06:38.016
Blimey! Where have they...?

06:40.012 --> 06:41.049
'The snowmobilers promptly vanished

06:41.084 --> 06:45.084
'because whilst I had to
stick to the ski runs,

06:45.119 --> 06:47.056
'they didn't. '

07:03.020 --> 07:06.068
Come on, you've crossed the
desert, you can do this.

07:09.088 --> 07:12.076
'As it turned out, the
Dakar was as fast on snow

07:12.111 --> 07:14.068
'as it would be on sand. '

07:14.103 --> 07:16.028
Oh, yes! That worked!

07:16.063 --> 07:17.965
I thank you!

07:18.000 --> 07:20.038
'So when I hit the lower slopes,

07:20.073 --> 07:22.076
'we were still neck and neck. '

07:31.008 --> 07:33.076
'I then decided to
take a short cut.

07:33.111 --> 07:35.000
'Which went well. '

07:37.072 --> 07:39.000
Oh! Oh!

07:41.048 --> 07:43.084
This is going to cost me time!

07:45.028 --> 07:46.072
Move, move, move!

07:55.056 --> 08:01.024
'Despite my cock-up, I was just ahead
as we entered the forest stage. '

08:01.059 --> 08:02.017
Yee-hah-hah!

08:02.052 --> 08:04.056
Keep up with that, then, boys!

08:07.064 --> 08:10.052
'But the teenagers were able to
whizz off between the trees. '

08:13.064 --> 08:15.064
Come on! Where the hell are they?

08:19.072 --> 08:24.008
'Which meant they had the lead as we
reached the final part of the race,

08:25.032 --> 08:28.044
'a six-mile dash across
the frozen lake. '

08:30.080 --> 08:31.053
Ooh, tree.

08:31.088 --> 08:33.087
Come on, come on!

08:37.008 --> 08:38.041
Yes, finally!

08:38.076 --> 08:42.000
I've got the top speed
of best part of 130 mph.

08:42.034 --> 08:45.008
This is where I have the advantage.

08:47.004 --> 08:49.080
'But up ahead, the snowmobilers
could still hit 90 mph.

08:51.056 --> 08:54.080
'So I'd have to give it
everything to close the gap. '

08:57.036 --> 09:01.020
This is where the
race is won or lost.

09:01.055 --> 09:02.068
This thing's got some grip!

09:06.004 --> 09:08.076
I'm just floating over this stuff.

09:14.092 --> 09:16.556
'With less than four miles to go

09:16.591 --> 09:19.020
'the snowmobilers
were still ahead. '

09:19.055 --> 09:20.040
Where are they?!

09:22.064 --> 09:27.036
'But then, joy of joys, the snow
on the ice started to thin out. '

09:27.071 --> 09:28.045
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

09:28.080 --> 09:31.040
Their machines will
have problems on this

09:31.075 --> 09:34.057
because the belts
themselves overheat

09:34.092 --> 09:38.044
running on straight ice, so
they can't give it everything.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.064
'And sure enough, they
started slowing down. '

09:42.099 --> 09:44.096
I'm going to catch them!

09:49.064 --> 09:51.973
That's them! That's them! Oh, yes!

09:52.008 --> 09:55.064
Oh, yes! What do you think of that?
Yee-hah-hah-hah!

10:00.048 --> 10:02.041
'The snow on the
lake thickened again,

10:02.076 --> 10:05.028
'and the snowmobilers
were back in the game.

10:07.040 --> 10:10.981
'But now the Touareg
had the edge. '

10:11.016 --> 10:13.550
That, I think, is the
finish line. That's it!

10:13.585 --> 10:16.049
This thing has conquered
sand and desert,

10:16.084 --> 10:20.024
now it's conquered snow,
mountains and frozen lakes.

10:20.059 --> 10:21.052
I'm going to win!

10:23.096 --> 10:26.060
Yes! Yes!

10:26.095 --> 10:28.989
Ha-ha!

10:29.024 --> 10:33.060
I did it! It's won through!

10:33.095 --> 10:34.096
What a machine!

10:36.044 --> 10:38.008
You've got to be...!

10:40.000 --> 10:42.048
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

10:45.088 --> 10:48.028
I could've done that.
I could've done that.

10:50.028 --> 10:51.029
What?!

10:51.064 --> 10:53.029
Did you... did you win that?

10:53.064 --> 10:57.000
Yes. Yes, I did. I'll admit they
did finish with a bit more of a...

10:57.035 --> 10:58.020
flourish, thing, there,

10:58.055 --> 10:59.017
but I won.

10:59.052 --> 11:01.989
I'm not really interested
in whether you won or not,

11:02.024 --> 11:05.028
I'm interested in that bit where
they said that their tracks,

11:05.063 --> 11:07.037
on their snowmobiles, got hot,

11:07.072 --> 11:08.977
cos they were running on ice.

11:09.012 --> 11:12.000
Yes. And they told you that?
Yeah, it's the friction.

11:12.035 --> 11:13.072
Ice generates a lot of friction,

11:13.107 --> 11:14.049
so they heat up.

11:14.084 --> 11:16.088
If you slide over
ice in your clothes,

11:16.123 --> 11:17.981
they'll actually burn off you.

11:18.016 --> 11:21.088
Do they also tell you things
like, Jimi Hendrix was in Abba?

11:21.123 --> 11:24.089
No! It's... Did theysay
that a Volvo 244

11:24.124 --> 11:27.021
holds the lap record
at the Nurburgring?

11:27.056 --> 11:31.052
No, stop, it's true, and you know
full well it is. Let's do the news.

11:31.087 --> 11:35.009
No. What I'm going to do is put
a piece of ice down the front

11:35.044 --> 11:39.030
of your trousers, to see if it sets
fire to your gentleman's sausage.

11:39.065 --> 11:43.016
No! I'm not saying ice is hot, just,
it can create a lot of friction!

11:43.051 --> 11:47.044
This is science, and you
don't understand that.

11:47.079 --> 11:50.012
So leave it, it's true.
OK? Yes. Yeah.

11:50.047 --> 11:51.013
Anyway, let's do the news.

11:51.048 --> 11:54.965
Oh, now, hey. This is an
important piece of news.

11:55.000 --> 11:58.032
A lot of people imagine the most
dangerous time of year to drive

11:58.067 --> 12:00.036
is... November, or
perhaps February,

12:00.071 --> 12:01.997
dark nights, fog, ice.

12:02.032 --> 12:06.004
But we were talking about this and
we think THE most dangerous time

12:06.039 --> 12:07.061
to drive a car, is roundabout now.

12:07.096 --> 12:12.088
Sunny skies, light breezes,
girls wearing short skirts.

12:12.123 --> 12:14.985
Dangerous. Very dangerous.

12:15.020 --> 12:17.096
Cos the thing is, you can't notlook.
No. You actually can't.

12:17.131 --> 12:19.613
You can't physically not look.
You have no choice.

12:19.648 --> 12:22.061
There are other things
you can choose not to do.

12:22.096 --> 12:27.080
It's easy not to use your mobile while
driving, easy not to drive after 18 pints
of lager,

12:27.115 --> 12:30.085
but you're driving along and, "
There's a girl, mustn't look...

12:30.120 --> 12:33.056
"I'm looking, I'm looking, I've
crashed, I'm still looking!"

12:33.091 --> 12:35.973
Do you have any idea
what we're on about?

12:36.008 --> 12:39.025
I drove through Soho the
other night, honestly,

12:39.060 --> 12:42.044
you know Linda Blair in the Exorcist?
My head was just...

12:42.079 --> 12:44.080
spinning around! 180 degrees!
Crashing into lampposts,

12:44.115 --> 12:46.060
letterboxes, and other cars!

12:46.095 --> 12:48.057
It's impossible not to!

12:48.092 --> 12:50.061
The thing is, we know
that Germaine Greer

12:50.096 --> 12:53.012
is actually an avid
viewer of Top Gear, and...

12:53.047 --> 12:55.076
Is she? No, she really is.
In your mind.

12:55.111 --> 12:56.061
No, she is!

12:56.096 --> 13:00.050
Anyway, she will be annoyed
about this but the fact is,

13:00.085 --> 13:03.969
what we're trying to say is we
can't help it, it's natural,

13:04.004 --> 13:07.020
I mean, in the last three days I've
nearly had two quite serious accidents...

13:07.055 --> 13:09.965
Even James May is
susceptible to it! Even me!

13:10.000 --> 13:13.056
That's proof! Yeah, but it was
roadworkers he was looking at! Ha-ha!

13:13.091 --> 13:17.981
Actually, do you not think there
is here a case for the burka?

13:18.016 --> 13:22.000
Aaah. Because the problem goes away...
The burka? No. No, honestly.

13:22.035 --> 13:24.021
The burka doesn't work.

13:24.056 --> 13:27.029
Cos I was in a cab in
Piccadilly the other day, OK?

13:27.064 --> 13:30.989
A woman in a full burka crossing
the road in front of the cab,

13:31.024 --> 13:35.020
tripped over the pavement, went head
over heels... Base over apex. Yeah.

13:35.055 --> 13:39.040
And up it came, red
G-string, stockings...

13:39.075 --> 13:42.040
Mate, that did NOT happen!

13:42.075 --> 13:44.049
I promise! I promise!

13:44.084 --> 13:49.064
No! It did! Did you see
thisincident on DVD or pay per view?

13:51.000 --> 13:55.044
The taxi driver will back
me up on that. He will.

13:55.079 --> 13:57.969
He was in the cinema with you?

13:58.004 --> 14:00.021
That never happened.
It did! Never happened.

14:00.056 --> 14:04.008
Next week, Jeremy visits a hospital,
and a nurses top falls off.

14:04.043 --> 14:06.045
In Jeremy's mind.

14:06.080 --> 14:10.056
Now, normally, OK, normally
I wouldn't bring this up.

14:10.091 --> 14:14.032
But Citroen UK has appointed
a new sales director, OK?

14:14.067 --> 14:17.020
And his name is Charles Peugeot.

14:17.055 --> 14:19.061
No, it isn't!

14:19.096 --> 14:22.989
I have photographic
proof, from Citroen,

14:23.024 --> 14:26.061
"Charles Peugeot".
It is! What were they thinking?!

14:26.096 --> 14:30.088
What's his e-mail address going
to be, charles. peugeot@citroen?

14:31.096 --> 14:32.977
So stupid!

14:33.012 --> 14:35.068
Hang on, hang on, what if
there are lots of people

14:35.103 --> 14:37.048
called Charles Peugeot
working at Citroen?

14:37.083 --> 14:39.028
So he ends up being charles...

14:40.088 --> 14:43.048
.. charles. peugeot405.

14:44.064 --> 14:47.546
Sorry, it wasn't worth it.

14:47.581 --> 14:50.993
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

14:51.028 --> 14:56.985
Hey, now, as we know, there's a
lot of chat around at the moment

14:57.020 --> 15:03.005
about cars that can run on biofuels
or on electricity or on hydrogen.

15:03.040 --> 15:08.080
But we wondering, "I wonder if it would be
possible to make a car that ran on cheese
and onion crisps?"

15:08.115 --> 15:10.009
LAUGHTER

15:10.044 --> 15:11.965
Corn beef salad.

15:12.000 --> 15:16.044
And do you know what? We found a
Porsche, or rather, Hammond has,

15:16.079 --> 15:17.053
that can.

15:17.088 --> 15:21.008
This is it. And the first thing
you'll notice is it's covered

15:21.043 --> 15:24.997
in this space-age foil stuff.

15:25.032 --> 15:29.076
Back here, there's this massive
wing, all very traditional Porsche,

15:29.111 --> 15:32.013
but, under here, nothing.

15:32.048 --> 15:36.080
Because this is the
first mid-engine 911.

15:36.115 --> 15:38.024
And what an engine it is.

15:51.072 --> 15:54.021
So right now it's
running on Frosties

15:54.056 --> 15:57.530
and one of those
chocolatey croissant things

15:57.565 --> 16:00.969
and a cup of coffee.
But it could equally run on

16:01.004 --> 16:04.052
fish and chips I had last
night or a big bag of Quavers.

16:04.087 --> 16:07.064
Really anything that
the driver can eat.

16:07.099 --> 16:10.985
OK, first corner coming up.

16:11.020 --> 16:13.021
The good thing about
this, of course,

16:13.056 --> 16:16.040
plenty of time to be
precise about your lines.

16:18.080 --> 16:20.969
CHEERING

16:21.004 --> 16:21.981
It's amazing!

16:22.016 --> 16:23.068
It's absolutely superb.

16:25.008 --> 16:25.977
Fabulous.

16:26.012 --> 16:31.032
It is a completely convincing 911,really,
isn't it?It is. It was made in Austria -

16:31.067 --> 16:34.041
sadly, it is a one-off.
It lives in a museum now.

16:34.076 --> 16:37.016
But it's fabulous and I
did do a whole lap in it.

16:37.051 --> 16:39.033
What was your time?
Well, I did it in...

16:39.068 --> 16:43.048
18 minutes... and 37 seconds!
Yeah! LAUGHTER

16:43.083 --> 16:46.020
CHEERING

16:51.020 --> 16:54.028
It's down here. It's down here.

16:54.063 --> 16:55.052
But I'm proud.

16:57.056 --> 16:58.068
Well done.

16:58.103 --> 16:59.045
Thank you.

16:59.080 --> 17:01.977
Since we're on the
subject of the lap board,

17:02.012 --> 17:07.023
we thought we would take a moment to share
some happy memories of an old friend.

17:14.023 --> 17:18.084
If you look back at all the amazing things
we've done with the Bugatti Veyron...

17:18.118 --> 17:20.040
HE LAUGHS

17:20.076 --> 17:25.000
.. you could be forgiven for thinking
it's the fastest car on the planet.

17:27.044 --> 17:30.033
The fact is, though,
it isn't, you see,

17:30.068 --> 17:33.973
because this car will
do 253 miles per hour,

17:34.008 --> 17:37.080
but there's now a car in America
called the Shelby Ultimate Aero...

17:39.088 --> 17:43.588
.. that will do 256 miles per hour.
So that, officially,

17:43.623 --> 17:48.088
is the world's fastest production
car, not this old knocker.

17:48.123 --> 17:51.032
The Germans are not pleased.

17:55.080 --> 17:59.052
So, behind closed doors,
in the Bugatti skunk works,

17:59.087 --> 18:01.000
they've created this...

18:07.084 --> 18:09.993
It's called the Super Sport.

18:10.028 --> 18:14.052
It's the Veyron's last hurrah and it's
been built with just one purpose...

18:16.016 --> 18:21.024
To be the undisputed fastest
production car ever made.

18:26.040 --> 18:31.032
On this car, the 0-60 time is the same
as it is on the standard Bugatti Veyron -

18:31.067 --> 18:35.553
2.5 seconds. But after that,
all is utterly changed.

18:35.588 --> 18:40.005
0-100 miles per hour now
takes just 4.5 seconds,

18:40.040 --> 18:45.973
which is the same as the 0-60
time of a Porsche 911 GT3.

18:46.008 --> 18:53.004
And this will go on to an alleged
top speed of 258 miles per hour.

18:57.028 --> 19:00.096
Naturally, that means the
Super Sport has more power.

19:02.056 --> 19:06.050
The standard Veyron famously
has 1,000 horsepower.

19:06.085 --> 19:10.009
The Super Sport's version
has 1, 200 horsepower.

19:10.044 --> 19:14.084
So why, you might wonder, does
it need the power of a Golf GTI

19:14.119 --> 19:18.056
added to it, just to do
another five miles per hour?

19:18.091 --> 19:20.989
Well, the reasons are
quite complicated

19:21.024 --> 19:24.076
and I've been barred by the producer
from explaining them properly.

19:24.111 --> 19:29.004
So here instead is the
primary school explanation.

19:34.084 --> 19:40.032
Well, the issue is the air, which has
genuine substance once you're trying to
move through it.

19:42.016 --> 19:45.550
The faster you go, the thicker
the air effectively becomes.

19:45.585 --> 19:49.049
At 100 miles per hour, it's
like aerosol whipped cream,

19:49.084 --> 19:55.004
but at 200 miles per hour, it's
more like a very thick treacle.

19:55.039 --> 19:57.521
And at 250 miles per
hour, it's like...

19:57.556 --> 20:00.004
trying to drive
through a fruitcake.

20:04.004 --> 20:09.056
And cutting through the fruitcake
requires more than just brute force,

20:09.091 --> 20:14.012
which is why this Veyron has
a new super slippery body.

20:17.000 --> 20:20.041
And a new super high price.

20:20.076 --> 20:24.036
Up from L1 million to L1.6 million.

20:26.064 --> 20:30.001
Anyway, big, fast Shelby
American car thingy,

20:30.036 --> 20:35.044
your gauntlet has now been picked up
by the one they call de langsamer -

20:35.079 --> 20:38.092
the Slow One. Captain Slow, to you.

20:40.052 --> 20:45.072
The setting for this judgement day run
is Volkswagen's top-secret test track...

20:45.107 --> 20:48.017
at Ehra-Lessien - a massive complex

20:48.052 --> 20:54.052
built in a former Cold War no-fly
zone near the old East German border.

20:54.087 --> 20:59.053
At its heart is this
13-mile oval-shaped track,

20:59.088 --> 21:05.017
which includes this 5.5-mile
arrow-straight straight.

21:05.052 --> 21:11.044
It's one of very few places on earth where
you can actually max a Bugatti Veyron.

21:17.044 --> 21:20.058
Nothing was left to chance
by the Bugatti boffins.

21:20.093 --> 21:23.037
We even had to wait until
the middle of the day

21:23.072 --> 21:29.036
when the air was at its thinnest before I
was finally given the all-clear to run.

21:29.071 --> 21:32.001
There's one thing making
me slightly apprehensive.

21:32.036 --> 21:36.013
I said, "How long do the tyres
last at 258 miles per hour?"

21:36.048 --> 21:41.080
And they said, "Well, we know how long they
last at 248 miles per hour - it's 37 miles.
"

21:41.115 --> 21:44.993
I said, "Yeah, but what
about 258 miles per hour?"

21:45.028 --> 21:50.072
What they actually said to me was, "Ask an
admiral how deep his submarines can really
go.

21:50.107 --> 21:53.032
"He doesn't know
until they try it. "

21:58.044 --> 22:03.028
As I ventured onto the track, I was quite
glad that they aren't ordinary tyres,

22:03.063 --> 22:06.977
but ones that cost L20,000 a set.

22:07.012 --> 22:11.012
I do feel a nervousness about
that extra five miles per hour.

22:14.004 --> 22:18.504
It takes me beyond the known
borders of car performance.

22:18.539 --> 22:23.004
I'm hanging my ass over the
ragged edge like Chuck Yeager.

22:25.088 --> 22:27.016
Anyway, concentrate.

22:28.028 --> 22:30.993
'The super-accurate
speedo read in kilometres

22:31.028 --> 22:36.045
'so the magic number we'd be looking
for is 414 kilometres per hour. '

22:36.080 --> 22:41.072
If I reach maximum speed, I'll be drinking
fuel at the rate of 1.7 gallons a minute.

22:41.107 --> 22:46.072
The radiators will be sucking
through four tonnes of air an hour.

22:46.107 --> 22:50.565
Just before the 5.5-mile
straight is some steep banking,

22:50.600 --> 22:55.024
which I'd have to enter at
exactly 125 miles per hour.

22:56.040 --> 23:00.020
Then I have to change down as
I pass a series of bollards,

23:00.055 --> 23:04.000
ready to give it the beans
as I come out the other end.

23:05.036 --> 23:07.020
Here we go. Here's the banking.

23:08.092 --> 23:11.024
Here comes the first bollard.

23:12.068 --> 23:14.036
Change down one.

23:16.024 --> 23:19.020
Here's a bollard. Change down two.

23:20.048 --> 23:24.028
Here's a bollard.
Change down three times.

23:24.063 --> 23:27.036
Godspeed, Captain Slow!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.973
Whoa!

23:31.008 --> 23:33.072
Bloody hell, look at
the speed of that!

23:35.020 --> 23:39.044
Doing 258... 260.. I'm going
faster than I can speak! 300!

23:39.079 --> 23:40.060
320!

23:42.036 --> 23:47.024
That is amazing! It's so stable.
I'm already up to 340.

23:50.068 --> 23:51.092
Bloody Nora!

23:54.048 --> 23:57.048
It's unbelievable! Look how
fast everything's going past!

23:59.028 --> 24:00.965
There's 400.

24:01.000 --> 24:04.016
'In Queen's English, that's
248 miles per hour. '

24:08.008 --> 24:09.048
Come on, come on, come on!

24:11.088 --> 24:13.005
I'm past my old record.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.048
'Now we were into the unknown. '

24:20.020 --> 24:21.088
Slightly twitchy.

24:28.056 --> 24:30.024
Come on! Come on!

24:31.072 --> 24:35.088
Yes! I think I may
have whupped your ass.

24:37.048 --> 24:38.033
Whoo-hoo!

24:38.068 --> 24:40.068
'And the speedo kept climbing. '

24:54.020 --> 24:55.072
417!

24:59.012 --> 25:00.088
HE LAUGHS

25:03.056 --> 25:05.044
HE LAUGHS

25:07.024 --> 25:08.064
Whoo-hoo!

25:10.044 --> 25:12.032
Bloody hell, that was exciting.

25:20.068 --> 25:21.985
CHEERING

25:22.020 --> 25:24.016
Hang on. No, no, wait!

25:24.051 --> 25:25.036
No!

25:26.036 --> 25:27.045
I'm sorry...

25:27.080 --> 25:33.096
Are you seriously suggesting that now we
open the Guinness Book of World Records

25:33.131 --> 25:37.036
and it says, "Fastest man
on earth - James May?"

25:37.071 --> 25:39.989
LAUGHTER Not exactly.

25:40.024 --> 25:43.993
What do you mean, not exactly?
Well, after I'd done my run,

25:44.028 --> 25:48.024
Bugatti sent a test driver out, because
they thought he'd like a crack at it,

25:48.059 --> 25:49.064
and this is what happened.

25:49.099 --> 25:51.013
So there he goes.

25:51.048 --> 25:54.064
He's got to do a run in each
direction and take an average.

25:54.099 --> 25:56.072
There's my old record already gone.

25:58.040 --> 26:02.036
As we can see, the
speedo is still climbing.

26:02.071 --> 26:03.041
There's him celebrating.

26:03.076 --> 26:06.056
I added my congratulations
soon afterwards.

26:06.091 --> 26:08.016
Damn him!

26:10.060 --> 26:14.040
So he obviously did it both w
ays,which you have to do. Yup.

26:14.075 --> 26:20.012
What was his average, then?
431 kilometres per hour.

26:20.047 --> 26:25.028
What's that in Church
of England?267...

26:25.063 --> 26:25.997
Oooh.

26:26.032 --> 26:29.032
In a car with windscreen wipers?
And a CD player!

26:29.067 --> 26:31.061
In a road car? That's staggering.

26:31.096 --> 26:36.004
We ought to find out, really, how
fast this goes round the track.

26:36.039 --> 26:37.060
Anybody want to see that?

26:37.095 --> 26:39.005
Yes!

26:39.040 --> 26:43.044
OK, that, of course, means handing
over to our racing driver.

26:43.079 --> 26:47.048
Some say the Scottish released
him a little bit too soon.

26:47.083 --> 26:49.060
LAUGHTER

26:50.096 --> 26:54.048
And that he spent all
week pushing an effigy

26:54.083 --> 26:58.000
of Rubens Barrichello
through his desk fan.

26:58.035 --> 26:59.029
LAUGHTER

26:59.064 --> 27:02.048
What we know is,
he's called the Stig!

27:04.092 --> 27:09.044
And he's off and just look how fast
that thing fires off the line -

27:09.079 --> 27:11.005
smoking all four tyres.

27:11.040 --> 27:17.000
OK, first corner. Simply flies into
those, almost cartoonishly fast.

27:17.035 --> 27:18.001
Just sensational.

27:18.036 --> 27:21.000
"Stayin' Alive" by the Bee Gees

27:22.028 --> 27:25.020
And in the midst of
this ferocious speed

27:25.055 --> 27:27.017
still has a stereo to listen to.

27:27.052 --> 27:30.037
Takes it gently round Chicago,
now popping off the limiter,

27:30.072 --> 27:35.020
Hammerhead, air brake goes vertical
generating 0.7G of braking -

27:35.055 --> 27:37.969
same as the actual
brakes of a Fiesta.

27:38.004 --> 27:42.032
50 kilos lighter than the original
Veyron but still a heavy car.

27:42.067 --> 27:44.041
# Staying alive, staying alive... #

27:44.076 --> 27:48.080
Your brain honestly can barely
take in how fast this thing is.

27:48.115 --> 27:52.048
What's really weird is it
hardly makes any noise. Listen!

27:52.083 --> 27:54.989
Just staggering. Two corners to go.

27:55.024 --> 27:59.965
Here we go. Using all the
grip of those 20 grand tyres.

28:00.000 --> 28:03.052
This is the Stig on maximum attack
and there he is, across the line!

28:03.087 --> 28:05.077
CHEERING

28:05.112 --> 28:07.068
So...

28:12.048 --> 28:15.045
Here's the old Veyron 1.18.3.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.072
We're expecting this to bea
little bit faster. Yup.

28:18.107 --> 28:21.029
But is it fast enough...
? Well, look at these.

28:21.064 --> 28:25.000
These are the ones - 17s.
The Gumpert, the Ascari and so on.

28:25.035 --> 28:27.096
Well, this one, the Super
Sport, did it in 1...

28:29.048 --> 28:30.536
.. 16.8.

28:30.571 --> 28:31.989
Oh!

28:32.024 --> 28:33.540
Fastest car ever...

28:33.575 --> 28:35.021
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

28:35.056 --> 28:37.997
.. ever... to go round our track.

28:38.032 --> 28:44.012
Now it's time to put a star
in our reasonably-priced car.

28:44.047 --> 28:46.040
We had a bit of a
problem, if we're honest,

28:46.075 --> 28:48.036
because we had Jedward booked.

28:48.071 --> 28:49.973
LAUGHTER

28:50.008 --> 28:54.000
At the last minute, they pulled out.
So we rang Cameron Diaz...

28:54.035 --> 28:55.021
LAUGHTER

28:55.056 --> 29:00.000
We did. We said, "Would you mind awfully
coming on the show?" She said, "Sure. Love
to.

29:00.035 --> 29:02.000
"But only if I can
bring Tom Cruise. "

29:02.035 --> 29:03.053
LAUGHTER

29:03.088 --> 29:06.566
So, ladies and gentlemen,
here on this...

29:06.601 --> 29:10.044
pokey motoring show
on BBC Two... LAUGHTER

29:10.079 --> 29:11.096
Cameron Diaz and Tom Cruise!

29:11.131 --> 29:14.000
CHEERING

29:18.072 --> 29:21.044
How are you? Fine, yourself?
How are you?

29:21.079 --> 29:24.040
CHEERING DROWNS SPEECH

29:28.052 --> 29:30.056
Do have a seat.

29:34.020 --> 29:37.052
Thank you. That's a bitof a reaction!
I know! It was a lot of fun.

29:37.087 --> 29:40.001
Can I just say, what
staggers me is, sitting here,

29:40.036 --> 29:45.088
it's almost like I've been joined by the
genetic blueprint for the human race with
these two.

29:45.123 --> 29:47.025
What do you think?LAUGHTER

29:47.060 --> 29:51.013
In design, in evolution, we'll reach
a point where they look like this.

29:51.048 --> 29:57.024
Cos how do you know...? You embark on
acting when you're in your late teens.

29:57.059 --> 30:00.043
How do you know that
later on in life

30:00.078 --> 30:03.028
you aren't going to become, well...

30:04.076 --> 30:07.064
For instance, Tom, why
don't you have ear hair?

30:07.099 --> 30:10.017
Next time I come on the
show I'll be like this.

30:10.052 --> 30:13.064
And then it'll go at the back...
Curling it and trimming it.

30:13.099 --> 30:16.041
Cos it's not like either of you
have taken care of yourself.

30:16.076 --> 30:22.012
You've broken every bonein your body over
the years. I've broken my nose a couple of
times

30:22.047 --> 30:27.032
and fingers and my
leg and toes, ribs.

30:27.068 --> 30:29.037
And you do your own stunts.

30:29.072 --> 30:34.068
You are proud of the fact that youdo a lot
of jumping up and downand falling off
things. Yeah,

30:34.103 --> 30:35.587
I do most of them.

30:35.622 --> 30:37.072
Do they hurt? Yeah.

30:37.107 --> 30:38.993
LAUGHTER

30:39.028 --> 30:41.977
Yes, some of them REALLY hurt.

30:42.012 --> 30:46.096
And you would have thought you would
have looked in a mirror and thought,

30:46.131 --> 30:49.045
"I'm quite good looking, I'd
better take care of this. "

30:49.080 --> 30:54.096
How many times have you broken yournose?
Well, it started very early, I was 11.

30:54.131 --> 30:57.020
I broke my nose four
times since I was 11.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.036
Four? Yes. Four times. Four times.

30:59.071 --> 31:02.020
BLEEP finds my face.

31:02.068 --> 31:05.048
It just does. Can you say
thaton television here?

31:08.000 --> 31:09.096
OK.

31:17.048 --> 31:19.530
Now, the new movie, Knight And Day,

31:19.565 --> 31:21.977
my kind of film, I have to say.

31:22.012 --> 31:26.000
Everything explodes, lots
of close-ups of Cameron,

31:26.035 --> 31:26.977
and you're funny.

31:27.012 --> 31:32.024
Is this comedy, is this a new...
Obviously not for you. She was so funny.

31:32.059 --> 31:33.973
I've done a few comedies.

31:34.008 --> 31:38.040
You had the gentleman juicein
your hair. Yes, I did.

31:38.075 --> 31:40.021
One of the great comedy
moments of our time.

31:40.056 --> 31:43.092
It didn't take very long
for it to get there either.

31:43.127 --> 31:46.060
It just was a very quick...
LAUGHTER

31:46.095 --> 31:51.041
What I meant was... No...

31:51.076 --> 31:56.028
This is why I love Cameron, I have to tell
you. It's so much fun working with her.

31:56.063 --> 31:59.981
Yeah. No, but I love comedy.
The comedy stuff...

32:00.016 --> 32:04.080
I started with Risky Business and I've
always had comedic elements in different
characters.

32:04.115 --> 32:09.061
I've had some intense films over the years
and I really want to do some comedy now.

32:09.032 --> 32:14.008
We've put a trailer together. OK.
So let's have a look at that.

32:14.043 --> 32:15.545
I want to talk about this guy.

32:15.580 --> 32:17.048
He was some sort of secret agent.

32:21.000 --> 32:23.033
Oh, no, no, no...
Hi, June. Who are you?

32:23.068 --> 32:26.028
This is the guy. I'm the guy.
It's the guy. I'm the guy!

32:27.040 --> 32:29.049
For your own safety,
please stay in the booth.

32:29.084 --> 32:33.084
What are you talking... Stay there,
or I kill myself and then her.

32:33.119 --> 32:35.004
Rodney... Rodney!

32:35.092 --> 32:39.040
Shot you through and through, Nowhere
near the femoral artery. It's all good.

32:39.075 --> 32:42.000
Might even get a promotion. Good?

32:47.080 --> 32:49.088
On your own, your life
expectancy is like here.

32:49.123 --> 32:52.092
With me, it's here.
With me, without me.

32:59.068 --> 33:01.092
On three. Ready? Uh-huh. One...

33:06.028 --> 33:09.044
Sorry, I panicked.
What numberwould you like? Three.

33:09.079 --> 33:11.072
Let's just stick with three.
It's good. OK.

33:11.107 --> 33:14.044
CHEERING

33:18.016 --> 33:19.076
Um...

33:22.012 --> 33:26.004
I'm sorry about this.
You look great in it but the thing is,

33:26.039 --> 33:29.084
in the movie, you restore
muscle cars for a living.

33:29.119 --> 33:32.096
This is pornography. What?

33:36.040 --> 33:38.985
What is it you have to
check in at the airport?

33:39.020 --> 33:43.973
Triple Deuce. A carburetor.
A Triple Deuce carburetor.

33:44.008 --> 33:48.068
Do you find this as well?When girls start
talking about... About cars and engines.

33:48.103 --> 33:50.036
Ohhhhhh...!

33:51.060 --> 33:55.020
Could you say a six-barrel
carburettor for a '66 Vette?

33:55.055 --> 33:58.072
A six-barrel carburetor
for a '66 Vette.

34:01.068 --> 34:04.032
I'm actually having a crisis.

34:06.000 --> 34:11.009
Do you put a lot of effort into
choosing the cars you use in movies?

34:11.043 --> 34:16.043
For example, in this movie, was there a lot
of effort went into the cars that were used?

34:16.079 --> 34:20.001
It's fun. We all sit around
and talk about which cars

34:20.036 --> 34:26.041
and motorcycles. We look at the train
and we line up a bunch of bikes

34:26.076 --> 34:31.083
and we look at the stunts that we're going
to develop, if there's going to be a lot of
jumps.

34:31.119 --> 34:33.094
We used the Ducati on this one.

34:33.130 --> 34:35.036
You were on cobbled streets...

34:35.072 --> 34:40.052
We needed a lighter motorcycle, we needed
something I could hold Cameron around.

34:40.087 --> 34:44.000
That's a stunt I've been wanting
to do for many, many years.

34:44.034 --> 34:45.049
LAUGHTER

34:45.083 --> 34:48.080
Have Cameron, you know...
It's not just you in this,

34:48.114 --> 34:50.996
you were doing your own
stuntsas well. Yes.

34:51.032 --> 34:55.024
There's this great scene where the
GTO, the daddy of muscle cars,

34:55.059 --> 34:58.981
and you're flicking it around allover
the place. It's a lot of fun.

34:59.016 --> 35:04.012
One of the things was, you often see actors
coming on, saying, "Yeah, I did my own
stunts",

35:04.047 --> 35:09.008
so I thought it would be a good ideato say,
"Come on, Cameron,take me out on the track.
" Yeah.

35:09.043 --> 35:13.076
Anybody want to see... I do. AUDIENCE: Yeah.
Let's have a look at this.

35:17.044 --> 35:20.032
This is just about as
good as life gets, really.

35:22.064 --> 35:25.000
It's going. You've got it.

35:30.072 --> 35:33.052
CHEERING

35:33.080 --> 35:35.084
Thank you, Jeremy.

35:35.119 --> 35:37.013
See? You see?

35:37.048 --> 35:41.096
All you've got to do is go
like this and "Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!"

35:41.131 --> 35:42.977
Yeah.

35:43.012 --> 35:45.084
How much fun is that?
I was vomiting.

35:47.032 --> 35:51.084
What cars do you drive to the shops in?
What are you everyday cars?

35:51.119 --> 35:55.068
Right now, I mostly... I drive
a lot of motorcycles right now.

35:55.103 --> 35:57.557
Bikes? Recently, a lot
ofmotorcycles. He does.

35:57.592 --> 36:00.808
So what have you got?
Let's run through them.

36:00.843 --> 36:03.467
I have a '34 Indian.
1934, that my wife bought me

36:03.502 --> 36:06.092
that used to belong to Steve
McQueen. There you go.

36:06.127 --> 36:08.057
That's actually it, is it? Yep.

36:08.092 --> 36:12.029
That was Steve McQueen's old Indian? Yeah.
What I'm interested in,

36:12.064 --> 36:18.028
this Virus, it looks the mostincredible
bike I've ever seen. It is incredible.

36:18.063 --> 36:21.077
That bike is beautiful.
Where's it made? Italy.

36:21.112 --> 36:24.057
And you have to be measuredfor
this, do you? Yes.

36:24.092 --> 36:28.004
They do your measurements and
build it to your specifications,

36:28.039 --> 36:30.012
my height and weight
and how I like to ride.

36:30.047 --> 36:31.057
So it's a tailored bike.

36:31.092 --> 36:33.965
Yeah, that's a tailored bike.

36:34.000 --> 36:38.528
Do you like bikes, Cameron?No, I don't.
I ride on the back of them very well.

36:38.563 --> 36:43.056
It's a good way of dealing withthe
paparazzi if you've got... The helmet on.

36:43.091 --> 36:46.088
I wear a helmet when I drive
my Prius You've got a Prius?!

36:47.088 --> 36:50.993
I love the PriusLAUGHTER

36:51.028 --> 36:55.080
So what cars... I thought it wasyour
favourite car. It IS my favourite car.

36:55.115 --> 36:58.088
Is that what you drive in and
out of town? We expect it.

36:58.123 --> 37:00.060
I'm married to my Prius.

37:01.060 --> 37:03.096
Love it.

37:06.020 --> 37:11.001
I discovered you had a Mustang
Celine, the tuned Mustang.

37:11.036 --> 37:15.032
The other Mustang that I'm
interested in of yours is your P-51,

37:15.067 --> 37:18.547
which is a WWll fighter
rather than a car.

37:18.582 --> 37:21.993
I just love... I grew up
and we travelled a lot

37:22.028 --> 37:26.005
and every time we travelled I had a
picture of a Spitfire and a P-51.

37:26.040 --> 37:31.076
As a little boy I'd fall asleep looking
at the pictures of airplanes on my wall

37:31.111 --> 37:33.037
and I always wanted to fly it.

37:33.072 --> 37:39.013
Years later I got my licence
and started flying aerobatics

37:39.048 --> 37:42.969
just to train on taildraggers so
that one day I could fly a P-51.

37:43.004 --> 37:48.040
Have you ever been in those fast jets that
you flew in Top Gun? Yes. You flew in the
F-... 15, yeah.

37:48.075 --> 37:50.049
I flew in the F-14. The Navy one.

37:50.084 --> 37:54.997
I flew also in the F-16 in Korea.
Can I just ask...

37:55.032 --> 38:00.076
This is really embarrassing, because
it's Tom Cruise... Did you puke?

38:01.028 --> 38:02.056
Yes, I did.

38:04.092 --> 38:06.985
I had three flights in one day.

38:07.020 --> 38:11.026
Actually, when you see the film,
some of the shots are in the airplane

38:11.061 --> 38:15.032
and we were doing heavy air combat
manoeuvres. My pilot's name was Bozo

38:15.067 --> 38:20.008
and I had the bag right there,
so I leaned down to fill the bag

38:20.043 --> 38:24.965
and as I leaned down, he
pulled up, went right up.

38:25.000 --> 38:30.004
My head was on the floor and I'm
trying to hit the mic and I'm going

38:30.039 --> 38:35.048
"Mother! Mother!
" My head is banging on the floor,

38:35.083 --> 38:36.981
pulling up...

38:37.016 --> 38:40.540
I finally came up and I
said, "What are you doing?"

38:40.575 --> 38:44.064
He says, "Well they don't
call me Bozo for nothing. "

38:45.060 --> 38:50.025
Anyway, obviously, you came here

38:50.060 --> 38:54.080
to see how fast you could driveour
reasonably priced cararound our track.
Absolutely.

38:54.115 --> 38:58.060
You're 33 films, you're 30, I think
this is the peak of your career now.

39:01.000 --> 39:04.060
I'm thinking of maybe
Cameron's lap first of all.

39:04.095 --> 39:08.084
Yeah? Ladies first?
Good idea?AUDIENCE: Yes!

39:08.119 --> 39:10.008
OK, let's have a look.

39:13.024 --> 39:16.024
So we're off, and
that's a good start.

39:16.059 --> 39:17.076
That's a good look.

39:17.111 --> 39:18.981
Here we go.

39:19.016 --> 39:21.061
How do you manage to suit a helmet?

39:21.096 --> 39:25.040
Nobody looks good in a helmet.
She looks good in a helmet.

39:29.012 --> 39:31.000
That's perfect.

39:32.096 --> 39:35.048
Ugh, that's fifth.

39:36.032 --> 39:38.048
These BLEEP English gears.

39:40.052 --> 39:44.088
They're Korean, actually.
To be honest, they're Korean gears.

39:47.044 --> 39:50.012
Sorry, Stig, totally BLEEP it up.

39:51.092 --> 39:55.064
He's never heard that word.
No?He doesn't know it exists.

39:55.099 --> 39:58.020
Now, did you keep it in the lines?

40:00.060 --> 40:01.096
Poetry, in essence.

40:01.131 --> 40:04.032
BLEEP me!

40:05.020 --> 40:06.092
Corner.

40:07.072 --> 40:10.012
BLEEP

40:11.040 --> 40:14.000
Some of this is broadcastable.

40:15.056 --> 40:17.061
Was that flat out through there?

40:17.096 --> 40:21.037
Are you flat out?
You didn'tlift off? It's flat out.

40:21.072 --> 40:25.040
Flat out, and then that's a
beautiful line through there.

40:26.088 --> 40:31.020
The traditional cee'd understeer
and there we are, across the line.

40:31.055 --> 40:33.032
APPLAUSE

40:33.068 --> 40:35.028
Very good.

40:39.024 --> 40:41.965
What is it? What is it?
What is it? What is it?

40:42.000 --> 40:48.008
Tell me, tell me, what is my time? I think
we'll look at Tom's lapfirst, shall we?

40:50.072 --> 40:54.012
Who wants to see Tom's lap?
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

40:55.080 --> 40:57.540
TYRES SQUEAL

40:57.575 --> 41:00.000
Nice start.

41:01.056 --> 41:04.036
And coming up now
to the first corner.

41:04.071 --> 41:06.044
That's a serious looking face.

41:06.088 --> 41:09.076
I'm going, "Is this third gear?
"That's what I kept doing.

41:09.111 --> 41:11.993
That's quite an interesting
line through there.

41:12.028 --> 41:16.016
The Formula 1 drivers come out really
wide but Stig thinks that's right.

41:16.051 --> 41:18.012
See if I can get
this to turn right.

41:19.036 --> 41:22.044
Let's have a look. Ooh, that's...

41:23.036 --> 41:25.041
That's a lesson in how to do it.

41:25.076 --> 41:28.056
Now Hammerhead. This is the
hardest corner of the lot.

41:28.091 --> 41:31.061
Did you stay in the
lines like Cameron did?

41:31.096 --> 41:34.032
No. You see, Cameron,
you can grin there.

41:35.040 --> 41:38.076
Now, we're flat out here
all the way to the end.

41:41.032 --> 41:43.012
Nice gearbox

41:44.096 --> 41:46.064
Flat through there.

41:46.084 --> 41:48.080
Yeah, and flat
through the next bit.

41:50.064 --> 41:54.024
That's so much fun. It is good.
This one's really fun too.

41:54.068 --> 41:56.072
And then...

41:56.092 --> 41:59.076
This is awesome.
You got it right that time.

42:09.092 --> 42:11.092
We could have killed you!

42:11.127 --> 42:13.048
CHEERING

42:16.000 --> 42:18.045
What if we'd actually killed you?

42:18.080 --> 42:24.076
I felt the wind come underneath.
I was feathering like a kite.

42:25.008 --> 42:26.017
"I'm on two wheels!"

42:26.052 --> 42:30.024
Thank God you managed to get it backon
all four wheels again. It was great fun.

42:30.059 --> 42:33.965
So what do we think? Fastest man's
a wizard, Rupert Grint at 1:45.5

42:34.000 --> 42:40.004
Slowest in the dry laps is Nick
Robinson, Political Editor for the BBC.

42:40.039 --> 42:43.523
He did it it 1:49.9.
So, Cameron, ladies first.

42:43.558 --> 42:47.008
This is the piece of paper
with the times on it.

42:47.043 --> 42:49.068
Good luck. Thanks, buddy.

42:50.080 --> 42:54.072
Cameron Diaz, you did it in one...

42:54.107 --> 42:55.088
forty...

42:59.040 --> 43:01.048
five...

43:05.004 --> 43:07.028
two. CHEERING

43:17.076 --> 43:18.568
Wow!

43:18.603 --> 43:20.060
Yes!

43:23.064 --> 43:25.012
Well done, you.

43:33.076 --> 43:34.989
Yes!

43:35.024 --> 43:41.036
Now, that's a magnanimous face but, let's
be honest, you're quietly crapping yourself.

43:42.096 --> 43:46.076
Oh, my God. 1:45.2, I doubt.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.973
Oh, just give it over.

43:51.008 --> 43:56.044
Give it over! Give it to him!
Even Tom Cruise leans forward.

43:56.079 --> 43:59.036
"I'm not interested.
I'm not interested. "

44:00.016 --> 44:03.008
Tom Cruise, you did it in one...

44:04.048 --> 44:06.068
forty... OK.

44:06.103 --> 44:08.088
SHE WHISPERS

44:09.052 --> 44:12.076
four. AUDIENCE WHOOPS

44:14.004 --> 44:16.024
CHEERING

44:20.056 --> 44:22.053
You Americans.

44:22.088 --> 44:26.000
APPLAUSE DROWNS SPEECH

44:39.040 --> 44:42.052
When I was on two wheels, I thought,
"I don't know what's going to happen. "

44:42.087 --> 44:46.024
Two wheels is obviously
the fastest way...

44:47.072 --> 44:50.032
You are a man who likes
racing, but that's quick.

44:50.067 --> 44:52.013
When the two wheels
were going through...

44:52.048 --> 44:55.020
I'm not going to come off and
they said, "This is it. "

44:55.055 --> 44:57.060
So I was thinking, "If I
go through on the side,

44:57.095 --> 44:59.008
does the time still count?"

44:59.043 --> 44:59.977
LAUGHTER

45:00.012 --> 45:02.049
It was... That was a
breathtaking thing.

45:02.084 --> 45:05.072
My whole day has just been...
It's been just... Wow.

45:05.107 --> 45:07.017
Such an honour to meet you, Tom.

45:07.052 --> 45:11.012
This was the best day. Cameron, thank
youvery much for making me sick.

45:11.047 --> 45:14.027
What's that? Thank youfor
making me feel sick.

45:14.062 --> 45:16.973
Oh, you are so welcome
Ladies and gentlemen...

45:17.008 --> 45:20.036
Thank you so much. Thank you all.
Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz.

45:20.071 --> 45:23.020
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE

45:27.080 --> 45:30.044
Thank you so much.
That was so much fun.

45:32.096 --> 45:34.005
Came to see a show about cars

45:34.040 --> 45:37.024
and you get to see Tom
Cruise and Cameron Diaz.

45:37.059 --> 45:39.080
They're great. Staggering.

45:40.084 --> 45:45.021
Anyway, anyway...
slight change of mood.

45:45.056 --> 45:49.036
Had he lived, Ayrton Senna
would have celebrated

45:49.071 --> 45:51.989
his 50th birthday
earlier this year.

45:52.024 --> 45:55.060
The weird thing is, I was talking
about this to my 14-year-old son,

45:55.095 --> 45:58.096
and he went, "Oh yeah, was he that
racing driver that got killed?"

45:58.131 --> 46:00.025
That makes me feel really old.

46:00.060 --> 46:03.001
I know, it's awful, but the
thing is, I said to him,

46:03.036 --> 46:08.080
"If you'd seen his funeral, you'd
know he was a bit more than that. "

46:11.044 --> 46:14.084
'One of the world's greatest motor
racing drivers, Ayrton Senna,

46:14.119 --> 46:16.021
'has died after a crash... '

46:16.056 --> 46:18.060
'Senna, three times
a world champion,

46:18.095 --> 46:20.064
'suffered massive
head injuries... '

46:20.099 --> 46:21.049
GERMAN COMMENTARY

46:21.084 --> 46:24.965
'A million people lined the
streets of his home city...

46:25.000 --> 46:28.044
'The Brazilian government has called
in full military officers... '

46:28.079 --> 46:32.052
'His home country has declared
three days of mourning. '

46:33.096 --> 46:37.048
I think I was nine years old
and I was racing that weekend

46:37.083 --> 46:41.052
and I just came in from a
heat or a practise session

46:41.087 --> 46:43.977
and my dad was working
away on the car

46:44.012 --> 46:47.072
and I remember him telling me. I remember
going round to the back of the car

46:47.107 --> 46:51.009
and just... balled my eyes out.
At nine years...

46:51.044 --> 46:54.088
I remember it like it was yesterday.
Exactly where I was, what spot.

46:54.123 --> 46:56.060
I could take you there right now.

46:57.056 --> 47:00.536
In Brazil, they remember
Ayrton Senna as a sporting hero

47:00.571 --> 47:03.981
who gave a way millions to
help underprivileged children.

47:04.016 --> 47:08.068
Elsewhere in the world, though,
we remember him best for this...

47:15.064 --> 47:17.012
'And Senna goes through. '

47:19.004 --> 47:20.064
'Senna goes through again!'

47:36.080 --> 47:38.993
Ayrton Senna did race in Formula 1

47:39.028 --> 47:43.044
from 1984- to his death
at Imola in 1994.

47:43.079 --> 47:46.025
'Ayrton Senna wins at Monaco. '

47:46.060 --> 47:51.036
In that time, he won the world
championship three times.

47:53.012 --> 47:57.000
The figures suggest that
Schumacher and Fangio were better,

47:57.035 --> 48:02.004
but the people who know,
they tell a different story.

48:02.084 --> 48:06.068
I think, Senna, I would
put him in number one.

48:06.103 --> 48:08.563
For me, Senna is number one.

48:08.598 --> 48:10.989
For me, he was number one.

48:11.024 --> 48:13.061
I would Ayrton Senna as number one.

48:13.096 --> 48:16.578
For me, Ayrton Senna
undoubtedly was the number one.

48:16.613 --> 48:20.060
I would put him number one.
He was the greatest driver.

48:20.095 --> 48:23.965
If you ask me, I put Senna
as well in number one.

48:24.000 --> 48:27.076
Martin Brundle, who races against
the Brazilian for 11 years,

48:27.111 --> 48:30.052
is well qualified
to explain why Senna

48:30.087 --> 48:32.061
was the ultimate drivers driver.

48:32.096 --> 48:37.082
He had a God given talent that I
haven't witnessed anywhere else.

48:37.117 --> 48:41.580
I sixth sense of where the grip was
before he turned into a corner.

48:41.615 --> 48:46.044
If you look at this Lotus, even
when it's going in a straight line,

48:46.079 --> 48:50.013
it is dancing.
Absolutely. And there.

48:50.048 --> 48:53.052
You look at these and you
think, I can't do that.

48:54.068 --> 48:55.985
I think Senna has the ability

48:56.020 --> 49:00.017
to be able to drive
completely on the limit.

49:00.052 --> 49:05.008
Some of the laps he did, we
know were, were unbelievable.

49:10.084 --> 49:13.017
And this is just...
This is manic. Look at this.

49:13.052 --> 49:16.068
How he reads those two guys,
he's absolutely on it, isn't he?

49:16.103 --> 49:17.965
This is... Look at that.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.053
'Senna was so good at banzai
last minute qualifying laps

49:21.088 --> 49:27.072
'that in his Formula 1 career, he
won an incredible 65 poll positions.

49:27.107 --> 49:30.020
Had had this gift to
just go and find...

49:30.055 --> 49:31.993
We could all find a tenth or two,

49:32.028 --> 49:35.032
the really great drivers could
go and find half a second

49:35.067 --> 49:37.000
or three quarters of a second.

49:37.035 --> 49:38.049
'Ayrton Senna... '

49:38.084 --> 49:41.045
However, Senna could do
even better than that.

49:41.080 --> 49:47.036
In Monaco in 1988, he out qualified
his teammate, the great Alain Prost,

49:47.071 --> 49:50.060
by a scarcely believable
one and a half seconds.

50:09.000 --> 50:12.044
Nobody, in the end, wanted
to spoil Senna's poll lap.

50:12.079 --> 50:15.025
When you saw the day-glow McLaren

50:15.060 --> 50:18.037
and the very bright
helmet of Ayrton Senna,

50:18.072 --> 50:21.052
he would come through and we
literally jumped out of the way.

50:21.087 --> 50:24.032
You didn't want to be the one
they talked about as having

50:25.024 --> 50:27.084
blown the lap that the whole
of the Grand Prix venue

50:27.119 --> 50:28.977
was looking forward to.

50:29.012 --> 50:33.024
'But it wasn't just out and out
speed that made Senna special. '

50:36.016 --> 50:41.052
He was so good because he was
working so hard on details.

50:41.087 --> 50:43.080
I brought the car
also there and there,

50:43.115 --> 50:45.571
but he went in the fine details.

50:45.606 --> 50:47.993
That's why he was fantastic.

50:48.028 --> 50:51.048
The worst is here.
The worst is the second chicane.

50:51.083 --> 50:52.057
Beneath the first chicane.

50:52.092 --> 50:57.050
But it is because the asphalt goes
like this in the third chicane

50:57.085 --> 51:02.008
and it's like this. In the second
chicane it's, you're coming bumpy.

51:02.043 --> 51:04.052
If I think back to when
I was his test driver

51:04.087 --> 51:05.997
at the beginning of the '94 season,

51:06.032 --> 51:09.524
after the second day he had a small
incident and tweaked his neck

51:09.559 --> 51:12.795
and that was it. The test was
over as far as he was concerned.

51:12.830 --> 51:16.032
Er, I came in the following day
and he was there! I thought,

51:16.067 --> 51:18.049
"OK, "he must have made
a miraculous recovery,"

51:18.084 --> 51:21.542
but in fact he was just there to
listen to what I was saying to

51:21.577 --> 51:25.000
the engineers, to work out whether
he could trust my feedback.

51:25.035 --> 51:27.053
When I compare that being
Nigel Mansell's test driver,

51:27.088 --> 51:31.036
he would set a lap time and then he
would bugger off to the golf course.

51:33.068 --> 51:37.058
Another weapon in Senna's armoury
was his utter ruthlessness.

51:37.093 --> 51:41.048
'Prost having a look, Senna
driving him into the pit wall. '

51:41.083 --> 51:43.561
'Schumacher trying
to take Ayrton Senna.

51:43.596 --> 51:46.040
'Let's see if the
Brazilian moves across.

51:46.075 --> 51:47.985
'Indeed he did. '

51:48.020 --> 51:53.060
He often used to put us in a position, erm,
that you were going to have an accident

51:53.095 --> 51:55.095
and he would leave it
up to you to decide

51:55.130 --> 51:57.061
whether to have that
accident or not.

51:57.096 --> 52:02.024
Martin experienced this
psychological warfare first of all

52:02.059 --> 52:05.009
when racing against
Senna in Formula 3.

52:05.044 --> 52:08.092
Look, I've got a great big lead
here and he launches in from nowhere

52:08.127 --> 52:13.025
and then... parks on my shoulder.

52:13.060 --> 52:17.050
I couldn't get out of the car until
they lifted his car off the top of mine.

52:17.085 --> 52:21.040
When he wanted to overtake, he'd go on
the inside and put the car in a place...

52:21.075 --> 52:23.977
If you tried to take the corner,
you're going to hit him. Yes.

52:24.012 --> 52:28.032
He would put you in a compromising position
and leave you to make that decision.

52:28.067 --> 52:32.017
And if you didn't run into to him,
psychologically you're buried and finished.

52:32.052 --> 52:36.080
He would then know that every time after
that it showed your wheel, you'll jump out
of the way.

52:36.115 --> 52:40.080
'He's got Mansell all over him.
He has no reason to stay out... '

52:40.115 --> 52:45.013
'Even the giants from Senna's
era respected his toughness. '

52:45.048 --> 52:49.088
I don't think there was any qualifying
session or any race he went into the wasn't
prepared

52:49.123 --> 52:51.029
to put it on the line.

52:51.064 --> 52:55.534
'All over the back, he's having a
look and he's inside Mansell. '

52:55.569 --> 53:00.004
He was the toughest driver and
the most ferocious driver to, um,

53:00.039 --> 53:02.061
protect his area or space.

53:02.096 --> 53:04.969
'Senna - all his skills involved.

53:05.004 --> 53:10.008
'He's got a much, much slower car
and clapped out tires on his car.

53:10.043 --> 53:13.567
'Mansell's got fresh rubber on.
All the grip in the world.

53:13.602 --> 53:17.057
'Blocking away and sliding a lot.
Senna's knocking it down. '

53:17.092 --> 53:23.032
'Mansell weaving this way and that
way, but Senna won't let him past.

53:23.067 --> 53:25.989
'He's got the racing line
and he's going to keep it. '

53:26.024 --> 53:31.080
This will to win reached it's peak
at the Japanese Grand Prix in 1990.

53:31.115 --> 53:35.012
Here, Senna would be world
champion providing his arch rival,

53:35.047 --> 53:38.041
Alain Prost, now at
Ferrari, failed to finish.

53:38.076 --> 53:43.024
So, at the first corner, he made
sure Prost failed to finish.

53:43.059 --> 53:45.013
'Alain Prost has
taken the advantage,

53:45.048 --> 53:47.566
'Senna is trying to go
through on the inside,

53:47.601 --> 53:50.084
'and it's happened immediately!
This is amazing!

53:50.119 --> 53:52.989
'Senna goes off at
the first corner. '

53:53.024 --> 53:56.072
'Yes, and that makes Ayrton Senna
world champion this year. '

53:56.107 --> 54:00.033
He doesn't even try to break?
No, no, no. At that point...

54:00.068 --> 54:04.000
when they are back there, Senna,
if he wanted to stay in the race,

54:04.035 --> 54:07.020
you'd have seen two puffs of
blue smoke from his front tires.

54:07.055 --> 54:09.559
That gap was always
going to disappear.

54:09.594 --> 54:12.029
He was driving into a
disappearing wedge.

54:12.064 --> 54:16.548
After the crash, he showed
absolutely no contrition.

54:16.583 --> 54:20.997
When there is a gap, you
either commit yourself,

54:21.032 --> 54:25.064
as a professional racing driver
that is designed to win races,

54:25.099 --> 54:29.005
or you come second or you
come third or you come fifth.

54:29.040 --> 54:33.000
I am not designed to come third,
fourth or fifth. I race to win.

54:33.035 --> 54:35.068
If you no longer go
for a gap that exists,

54:35.103 --> 54:37.096
you're no longer a racing driver.

54:39.024 --> 54:41.965
Strangely, Senna had a big heart.

54:42.000 --> 54:46.016
He was a devote Christian capable
of extraordinary compassion.

54:49.008 --> 54:52.021
When fellow racing driver
Erik Comas crashed in 1992,

54:52.056 --> 54:57.052
Senna stopped and risked his own life
running across the track to help.

54:58.072 --> 55:01.044
That's the paradox of
Ayrton Senna, isn't it.

55:01.079 --> 55:03.981
In that he was clearly a
fantastic human being.

55:04.016 --> 55:08.969
And he cared about people in Brazil,
he cared about racing drivers.

55:09.004 --> 55:15.021
I mean he was mortally hurt when
Ratzenberger died the day before he died.

55:15.056 --> 55:21.004
But then he would crash Alain Prost off the
race track and put both their lives at risk.

55:22.032 --> 55:25.965
As a man, Ayrton Senna
was hard to fathom,

55:26.000 --> 55:30.024
but when it rained it was easy
to spot his talents as a driver.

55:30.059 --> 55:33.076
'And Senna is a wet
weather master!'

55:38.032 --> 55:40.977
This is Donnington in 1993.

55:41.012 --> 55:46.012
The track is wet and Senna, in an inferior
McLaren, is in trouble at the start.

55:46.047 --> 55:49.048
'Coming up well Senna is crowded
out and down to fifth position.

55:49.083 --> 55:52.037
'Wendliger is up into third
place ahead of Schumacher

55:52.072 --> 55:57.997
'Prost leads, Hill second, and Ayrton Senna
is up to fourth position ahead of
Schumacher.

55:58.032 --> 56:03.088
'Challenging Wendliger as they go round the
right-hander into the old hairpin. Senna is
up to third.

56:03.123 --> 56:06.061
'A quite brilliant couple
of corners by Ayrton Senna.

56:06.096 --> 56:10.068
'Tremendous stuff. He muscled his way
back into the contention at Redgate.

56:10.103 --> 56:14.585
'He's going inside Damon Hill and
Senna into second place already. '

56:14.620 --> 56:19.068
'So, two retirements already...
and Senna goes through into the lead!

56:19.103 --> 56:22.036
'He's past Alain Prost so...
' And that was it.

56:22.071 --> 56:25.013
One lap, fifth to first. Yeah.

56:25.048 --> 56:30.000
If you want to have 40 seconds of, what is
Ayrton Senna the racing driver all about?

56:30.035 --> 56:32.005
There it is in a nutshell. Yeah.

56:32.040 --> 56:34.985
After the race, though,
he was completely calm.

56:35.020 --> 56:40.044
Driving with slicks in damp
and really slippery conditions

56:40.079 --> 56:42.037
was... was tremendous.

56:42.072 --> 56:48.084
Conditions like this is gambling and
it's taking chances that pays off

56:48.119 --> 56:51.016
and I think we gambled good.

56:53.000 --> 56:57.024
Of course you have to remember that
Senna was doing his gambling in cars

56:57.059 --> 57:00.020
that were like wild
ferocious animals.

57:03.024 --> 57:06.981
This McLaren MP44, in
which he won eight races

57:07.016 --> 57:11.060
and his first world championship,
had very little down force,

57:11.095 --> 57:16.000
a manual gear box and
1,200 horse power.

57:16.035 --> 57:19.025
450 more than the F1 cars of today.

57:19.060 --> 57:23.042
It is the last of the
turbo charged monsters.

57:23.077 --> 57:27.024
One of the greatest
racing cars ever made.

57:27.059 --> 57:30.531
And today, it's going
to rumble again

57:30.566 --> 57:34.004
in the hands of Senna's
number one fan.

57:35.036 --> 57:36.040
I'm nervous.

57:38.000 --> 57:40.088
There it is. Wooooo!

57:42.040 --> 57:45.048
I can't believe that, um...
Oh, jeez...

57:45.083 --> 57:47.049
LEWIS GIGGLES

57:47.084 --> 57:51.042
You've just got back from the Canadian
Grand Prix this morning? Yeah.

57:51.077 --> 57:55.000
I couldn't sleep. Really?
I slept like an hour or so on the flight.

57:55.035 --> 57:58.040
I couldn't get to sleep...
Cos you get to drive Senna's MP4?

57:58.075 --> 58:01.559
I just can't imagine what
it's going to be like.

58:01.594 --> 58:05.009
I just have this...
I have this sound in my head

58:05.044 --> 58:09.016
of the car roaring and going through
Monaco streets when he's one handed.

58:11.084 --> 58:15.032
I'm going to go one handed and see what
it's like round one of the corners.

58:15.067 --> 58:17.008
Let's go, let's go. Can I go?

58:18.060 --> 58:20.536
ENGINE ROARS

58:20.571 --> 58:23.012
LAUGHS GLEEFULLY

58:25.016 --> 58:27.064
Ooh, it's BLEEP.

58:29.092 --> 58:31.084
LAUGHS EXCITEDLY

58:31.119 --> 58:33.076
Woo-hoo-hoo!

58:38.020 --> 58:41.985
Oh, yeah! Whoa-ho-ho-ho, my God!

58:42.020 --> 58:47.038
The racing back in the mid '80s
was, I mean there's an incredible

58:47.073 --> 58:52.056
scene with Nelson Pike overtaking
Senna on full opposite lock.

58:52.091 --> 58:54.985
Very little in the way of safety,

58:55.020 --> 58:58.048
very little in the way
of aerodynamic grip.

59:00.044 --> 59:02.033
Manual gearboxes,
1,200 horse power.

59:02.068 --> 59:06.070
Yeah, and the cockpit, you
could almost punch through it.

59:06.105 --> 59:10.037
So you think, jeez, you're
driving around at those speeds,

59:10.072 --> 59:14.052
your wheel falls off, the mechanic
makes a mistake, you're dead.

59:14.087 --> 59:16.561
It's phenomenal and I
can't even contemplate

59:16.596 --> 59:19.001
what it would have
been like, but, er...

59:19.036 --> 59:23.040
So that's why I think you have even more
respect for the guys that did it back then.

59:23.075 --> 59:29.044
You had to be, back
in the '80s... Crazy.

59:34.088 --> 59:38.969
You know, you've got your
Mansells, Pikes, Prost...

59:39.004 --> 59:43.048
The drivers were... It's justthe right
time... incredible and you think that
shining out

59:43.083 --> 59:46.049
from all of those drivers
in that great era...

59:46.084 --> 59:49.016
Yep... Senna rose to the top.
Senna rose to the top.

59:52.024 --> 59:54.088
I don't want to go in.
Let's do another lap!

59:56.052 --> 01:00:00.088
I loved the fact that he would fight
for what he truly believed in.

01:00:00.123 --> 01:00:04.088
It's just everything! He puts
everything into getting that lap

01:00:04.123 --> 01:00:08.048
and he had no fear.
That's what I loved about it.

01:00:12.016 --> 01:00:14.028
I love this car!

01:00:14.063 --> 01:00:15.555
I love it.

01:00:15.590 --> 01:00:17.013
Come on.

01:00:17.048 --> 01:00:18.977
LEWIS SIGHS That's amazing.

01:00:19.012 --> 01:00:23.965
Oh, it' so much... It's nothing
like the car I drive nowadays.

01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:28.044
But just to know the commitment and
to get used to driving this car

01:00:28.079 --> 01:00:32.028
on the limit, I just...
I just couldn't imagine it, man.

01:00:36.028 --> 01:00:38.048
It's one of the best
days of my life.

01:00:38.083 --> 01:00:40.045
I just feel so blessed, you know.

01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:43.092
I dreamed my whole life
of driving that car.

01:00:43.127 --> 01:00:45.052
My whole, my whole life.

01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:50.004
I just, er, just ticked
off one of my dreams.

01:00:58.096 --> 01:01:04.024
I'll be honest with you,
I was never a Senna fan.

01:01:04.059 --> 01:01:05.981
I always thought Gilles Villeneuve

01:01:06.016 --> 01:01:08.061
was the greatest racing
driver of them all, but...

01:01:08.096 --> 01:01:12.061
to make this film, I've watched
hours and hours and hours of footage

01:01:12.096 --> 01:01:19.092
and the thing is, Villeneuve was
spectacular on a number of occasions...

01:01:22.052 --> 01:01:26.080
Senna, he was spectacular every
single time he got in a car.

01:01:44.084 --> 01:01:47.542
There's an amazing film
coming out in the next year

01:01:47.577 --> 01:01:51.000
and I urge you all to go and see it.
It's fantastic.

01:01:51.035 --> 01:01:52.084
But for now, goodnight.

01:01:53.324 --> 01:02:01.014
