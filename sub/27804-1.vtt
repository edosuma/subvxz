WEBVTT

00:06.006 --> 00:08.049
[birds chirping]

00:08.133 --> 00:09.718
[man] I had no idea what I was doing.

00:10.969 --> 00:13.346
And I had no idea who I was dealing with.

00:14.222 --> 00:16.808
But I knew it was a hell of a story.

00:17.767 --> 00:20.520
So I went into the prison
with my tape recorder.

00:22.897 --> 00:26.401
And I asked him, "What sort of person
could have done these things?"

00:26.818 --> 00:29.320
[male reporter] Police say he was armed
with a heavy oak log.

00:29.404 --> 00:32.574
He clubbed and then strangled to death
20-Year-old Lisa Levy

00:32.657 --> 00:36.161
and 21-year-old Margaret Bowman.
At least one of them was raped.

00:36.786 --> 00:39.789
He insisted that he was innocent.

00:40.623 --> 00:44.169
I wanted him to tell me, who was he...

00:44.252 --> 00:47.172
[male reporter] Diabolical genius,
deceptive, manipulative.

00:47.255 --> 00:49.215
[female reporter]
He's also a former social worker

00:49.299 --> 00:50.842
and a political campaign activist.

00:51.301 --> 00:54.471
[man] I consider him a friend,
he was a very nice person.

00:54.554 --> 00:58.683
[woman] I felt a connection with him.
A feeling of wanting to be loved.

00:59.809 --> 01:03.646
[man] I wanted to know what went through
his mind, what led up to it.

01:04.064 --> 01:06.483
[woman] Our son
is the best son in the world.

01:06.566 --> 01:08.985
He was a very normal, active boy.

01:09.069 --> 01:12.155
[woman #2] His mom and dad
took him to church every Sunday.

01:12.238 --> 01:14.115
[man] He wanted to be successful...

01:14.199 --> 01:16.618
as an attorney or as a politician.

01:17.285 --> 01:19.496
[man #2] What are
the elements of the crimes?

01:19.579 --> 01:21.081
Why the victims?

01:21.706 --> 01:23.875
[man] This man
on the FBI's 10 most-wanted list

01:23.958 --> 01:25.335
has been captured in Florida.

01:25.418 --> 01:27.170
[man #2]
Suspected of dozens of sex killings

01:27.253 --> 01:30.006
in Washington State, Idaho,
Utah, and Colorado.

01:30.090 --> 01:32.884
[man #3] The discovery
of the skeletal remains of six women.

01:32.967 --> 01:35.053
[woman] More than 20 young women
in five states...

01:35.136 --> 01:37.680
-[man #4] Beaten and strangled.
-[woman #2] Abduction, nude body.

01:37.764 --> 01:40.975
-[man #5] We found parts of four skulls...
-[man #6] Sexually molested.

01:41.059 --> 01:43.728
-[man #7] Bludgeoned, raped.
-[man #8] These 36 sex killings...

01:43.812 --> 01:45.271
[man] Mutilation, necrophilia.

01:45.355 --> 01:47.565
[man #2] Sexually mutilated
by mouth, by teeth.

01:47.649 --> 01:48.650
[woman] Bite marks.

01:48.733 --> 01:50.819
[man #3] He had sex with them
after they were dead.

01:50.902 --> 01:52.237
[man #4] Why did he do it?

01:52.779 --> 01:54.405
[woman] It's quite a mystery.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.619
[man] So he looked at me
and grabbed my tape recorder.

02:01.162 --> 02:05.291
Then he twisted in his chair
and was cradling it like this.

02:06.000 --> 02:07.418
And off he went.

02:08.419 --> 02:11.506
[man] It is a little after nine o'clock
in the evening.

02:12.632 --> 02:14.092
My name is Ted Bundy.

02:15.260 --> 02:17.720
I've never spoken to anybody about this.

02:18.179 --> 02:23.226
But I am looking for an opportunity
to tell the story as best I can.

02:24.477 --> 02:26.688
I mean, I'm not an animal
and I'm not crazy.

02:26.771 --> 02:28.648
I don't have a split personality.

02:29.732 --> 02:31.943
I mean, I'm just a normal individual.

02:36.656 --> 02:38.241
[theme song playing]

03:26.998 --> 03:28.875
[Jimmy Carter]
I wanna talk to you, right now,

03:28.958 --> 03:33.254
about a fundamental threat
to American democracy.

03:34.797 --> 03:38.218
It is a crisis of confidence.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.097
[male reporter] The '70s, an angry era.

03:43.181 --> 03:47.060
Inflation, Vietnam, Watergate, Iran,

03:47.435 --> 03:51.606
demonstrations and riots, the rip-off,
the scam, the hustle, the cheat.

03:52.232 --> 03:53.483
[male reporter #2] In the '70s,

03:53.566 --> 03:56.444
there is fear:
fear of crime in the streets.

03:56.903 --> 04:00.448
Violent crimes were up 130%
in the last 10 years.

04:00.907 --> 04:04.786
Murder, up 62%, rape 116%.

04:04.869 --> 04:09.165
[man] In the 1970s,
the phenomenon of serial murder

04:09.249 --> 04:12.919
was brand new and absolutely frightening.

04:13.336 --> 04:15.296
[male reporter]
Motiveless, random killings

04:15.380 --> 04:16.798
sometimes thousands of miles apart.

04:16.881 --> 04:20.134
But at the time,
the term "serial killer" didn't exist.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.470
[male reporter]
Charles Manson and three girl members

04:22.553 --> 04:24.013
of his so-called family

04:24.097 --> 04:26.516
were found guilty of murder
in the first degree.

04:26.599 --> 04:28.601
[male reporter #2] ...for the murders
of actress Sharon Tate and eight others.

04:29.811 --> 04:32.897
The fact, that somebody could murder,
murder and murder...

04:33.439 --> 04:36.609
[male reporter] In New York,
the search continues for the "Son of Sam".

04:36.693 --> 04:41.030
The past year, the killer has killed
five people and wounded four.

04:41.114 --> 04:44.367
...and could get away with it
for a long time and be undetected.

04:44.450 --> 04:47.245
[female reporter] 13 young women were
murdered over a period of six months.

04:47.328 --> 04:49.872
Their bodies dumped in hilly areas
of Los Angeles.

04:49.956 --> 04:52.625
...in the so-called
"Hillside Strangler Murders".

04:52.709 --> 04:54.335
It really unnerved people.

04:54.419 --> 04:56.212
[male reporter]
Police today found six more bodies

04:56.296 --> 04:57.880
under the John Gacy house.

04:57.964 --> 05:01.050
[female reporter] Gacy admitted killing
the young men after having sex with them.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.303
You see bodies in your sleep,

05:03.386 --> 05:06.139
you see him in your sleep,
it's just too much.

05:06.222 --> 05:08.641
But nobody unnerved them more than Ted.

05:08.725 --> 05:10.852
[indistinct chatter]

05:10.935 --> 05:14.022
[man] The mysterious former law student
with a charming air in court,

05:14.105 --> 05:16.983
Bundy is on the FBI's top 10
most-wanted list.

05:17.066 --> 05:19.986
Being sought for questioning
in 36 slayings.

05:20.695 --> 05:24.115
[Michaud] Ted stands out
because he was quite an enigma.

05:25.241 --> 05:28.244
Clean-cut, good looking, articulate,

05:29.203 --> 05:30.455
very intelligent,

05:30.955 --> 05:33.416
just a handsome, young,
mild-mannered law student.

05:33.875 --> 05:37.045
Yes, I intend to complete my legal
education to become a lawyer,

05:37.128 --> 05:38.838
and be a damn good lawyer.

05:38.921 --> 05:43.634
Then I have a great model over here,
so I think things are gonna work out.

05:43.718 --> 05:45.053
That's about all I can say.

05:46.012 --> 05:48.514
[Michaud] He didn't look
like anybody's notion of somebody

05:48.598 --> 05:50.266
who would tear apart young girls.

06:10.620 --> 06:14.457
[Michaud] Ted and I
first met face-to-face on death row

06:14.999 --> 06:16.751
in 1980.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.713
My agent had come to me

06:20.797 --> 06:23.466
saying that Ted Bundy,
famous serial killer,

06:23.549 --> 06:27.136
had sent a message out
that he was willing to speak

06:27.220 --> 06:29.305
exclusively with a journalist

06:29.389 --> 06:34.268
in exchange for a reexamination
of all the cases against him,

06:34.352 --> 06:36.312
which, he said, would prove
that he was innocent.

06:37.897 --> 06:40.566
I thought,
that if Ted was telling the truth,

06:40.775 --> 06:42.568
that he has been set up,

06:42.944 --> 06:44.570
that it was a hell of a story.

06:45.571 --> 06:49.200
If it wasn't the truth,
then it was also a hell of a story.

06:50.618 --> 06:53.830
At the time,
I was still a reasonably young reporter

06:53.913 --> 06:56.999
and I'd certainly never had
that big a story in my lap.

06:57.667 --> 07:03.464
I think Ted regarded me as somebody
to be manipulated or used in his cause.

07:05.007 --> 07:09.762
So I called my old mentor, Hugh Aynesworth
for whom I had worked at Newsweek.

07:10.179 --> 07:12.932
[Aynesworth] Stephen called me
asking would I help him,

07:13.015 --> 07:15.143
would I work with him? I said, "Sure."

07:15.893 --> 07:19.063
It just seemed like a good story,
either way it went.

07:19.397 --> 07:23.568
And I knew that nobody else to that point
had any access to him.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.071
People were trying all over the world
to get with Bundy.

07:29.073 --> 07:32.577
[Michaud] We reached an agreement
to cooperate with Ted on a book.

07:32.660 --> 07:37.039
So, Hugh took off for the West Coast
to re-investigate the cases.

07:37.832 --> 07:40.460
And I went to Florida
with my tape recorder.

07:47.425 --> 07:51.012
I can't tell you how nervous I was
walking to the prison the first time.

07:55.475 --> 07:57.185
Death row's not any fun.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.731
The guard took me down this long corridor.

08:02.523 --> 08:05.109
And then around to the left
into this room.

08:06.903 --> 08:08.488
Then Ted was brought in.

08:10.740 --> 08:14.994
I'd known Ted from newspaper articles,
a lot of television.

08:15.077 --> 08:18.956
The mystery, the aura
of the most infamous accused

08:19.040 --> 08:20.791
mass killer in the country.

08:21.334 --> 08:24.253
Now, we were face-to-face,
the two of us, in the same room.

08:30.551 --> 08:35.640
And there was nothing besides
his belly chain and his death row clothes

08:36.140 --> 08:40.186
to tell you that Ted was anything other
than just a regular guy in his early 30s,

08:40.269 --> 08:42.480
who was there talking over
a business deal.

08:44.440 --> 08:49.820
And over the next six months,
we'd recorded between 75 and 80 tapes,

08:49.904 --> 08:52.365
roughly a hundred hours
of recorded conversation.

09:08.464 --> 09:10.758
[Bundy]
Testing one, two, three, four, five.

09:12.301 --> 09:13.135
[beep]

09:13.219 --> 09:14.220
[Michaud] That going okay?

09:14.303 --> 09:17.598
[Bundy] I'm getting a red light.
Blink, blink, blink. Record.

09:17.682 --> 09:19.433
-[Michaud] That means it's recording.
-Oh.

09:19.517 --> 09:21.936
It's blinking. It's not on permanently.

09:22.019 --> 09:25.106
[Michaud] Yeah, well...
It should blink in response to the voice.

09:25.189 --> 09:26.941
[Bundy] Blink-blink. Oh, I see.

09:28.401 --> 09:32.405
[Michaud] When we first sat down together,
we had a little bit of small talk.

09:32.738 --> 09:34.365
[young Michaud]
May I have a cigarette, please?

09:34.448 --> 09:36.242
-[Bundy] Oh, sure, go right ahead.
-Thank you.

09:36.325 --> 09:38.494
-[Bundy] They're good for you.
-They are?

09:38.995 --> 09:41.706
-[Bundy] Only cause mild forms of cancer.
-Right.

09:42.039 --> 09:45.126
It turned out that we had a lot
superficially in common,

09:45.209 --> 09:48.963
that we were both born in,
in Burlington, Vermont,

09:49.046 --> 09:52.758
and had moved with our mothers
to Tacoma, Washington,

09:52.842 --> 09:54.677
a working class suburb of Seattle.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.970
We were quite young.

10:01.392 --> 10:04.353
[Bundy] Our house was on Sheridan street,
in Tacoma.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.690
Second house from the corner

10:08.399 --> 10:10.776
on the west side of the street.

10:12.153 --> 10:15.698
Moved there, I would guess, about 1951.

10:16.407 --> 10:17.825
[Michaud] We were not friends,

10:17.908 --> 10:19.994
but we actually
knew some people in common.

10:20.703 --> 10:22.663
[Bundy] Yeah, I remember Warren Dodge

10:23.623 --> 10:24.874
one of my childhood buddies.

10:24.957 --> 10:28.836
We both went to football practice
in the play field across from the tavern

10:28.919 --> 10:32.381
and then we fished at the pier just across
the railroad tracks from the tavern.

10:34.008 --> 10:37.136
He was very cautious with me,
businesslike.

10:37.553 --> 10:40.222
[Bundy] I'm particularly fond of

10:40.306 --> 10:42.558
looking at things in a chronological way.

10:43.267 --> 10:44.894
Times, dates, places.

10:45.978 --> 10:51.067
I understood from that meeting,
that I was there to take down Ted's story.

10:51.150 --> 10:53.611
The story that he wanted to tell.

10:54.487 --> 10:57.948
[Bundy] People perceive me differently
from how I perceive myself.

10:58.824 --> 11:01.452
And I need to give others a chance to know

11:01.535 --> 11:04.997
what was really going on,
what it was really like for me.

11:08.417 --> 11:09.543
[click]

11:15.091 --> 11:17.426
[helicopter thrumming]

11:21.889 --> 11:24.225
[police radio chatter]

11:26.560 --> 11:29.355
[male reporter] In and around Seattle,
police began investigating

11:29.438 --> 11:31.065
a young woman who disappeared.

11:31.816 --> 11:35.194
Lynda Ann Healy, a 21-year-old,
University of Washington student,

11:35.277 --> 11:37.321
disappeared from her Seattle apartment.

11:37.697 --> 11:40.908
Lynda lived here in this green house
in the university district

11:40.991 --> 11:43.661
along with five other university students.

11:43.744 --> 11:46.956
She was last seen here Thursday evening,
about 12 o'clock.

11:50.543 --> 11:52.878
[woman] I was a detective
with King County police

11:52.962 --> 11:54.255
in Seattle, Washington,

11:54.797 --> 11:57.299
and I recall when she had gone missing

11:57.383 --> 11:59.552
because Lynda was the...

11:59.635 --> 12:03.681
weather person and the ski report person
for a local radio station,

12:03.764 --> 12:07.393
a very popular station
that I happened to listen to everyday

12:07.476 --> 12:09.812
to see if I wanted to go skiing that day.

12:10.980 --> 12:13.858
According to her roommate,
her alarm went off on time

12:13.941 --> 12:15.943
Friday morning at 5:30,

12:16.026 --> 12:19.029
but her roommate says
Lynda wasn't in her room

12:19.113 --> 12:21.449
and she never showed up for work.

12:22.700 --> 12:25.494
[McChesney] Lynda didn't come to work
on a particular day,

12:25.619 --> 12:28.581
and some of the other people
in the radio station

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
commented over the air

12:30.499 --> 12:33.294
that Lynda must be sick,
Lynda didn't show up.

12:33.836 --> 12:36.297
That was very unusual because she was

12:36.380 --> 12:39.175
a person that you relied on
five days a week

12:39.258 --> 12:41.719
to tell you
what was going on in the mountains.

12:42.636 --> 12:46.599
[girl] I was in my room studying late,
probably till about almost 2:00,

12:47.016 --> 12:50.561
and she came in at about 11:30
into my room and spoke with me then.

12:51.103 --> 12:53.355
And she seemed
in a really pretty happy mood.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.983
And then she said she was going to bed
and that was about 12:00.

12:57.359 --> 12:59.904
[McChesney]
When Lynda didn't show up the next day,

12:59.987 --> 13:04.408
the newspapers then proceeded
to tell the public

13:04.909 --> 13:07.203
that Linda was gone.

13:07.286 --> 13:08.871
and it was quite a mystery,

13:08.954 --> 13:12.500
because she was
a very responsible young woman.

13:13.626 --> 13:16.378
There was a crime scene search
at that point.

13:20.341 --> 13:23.093
The room was very neat.

13:23.177 --> 13:26.430
There was no signs of foul play
in the room,

13:26.514 --> 13:29.225
except some blood on the pillow

13:29.308 --> 13:31.477
and head area
on the sheets of Lynda's bed.

13:34.188 --> 13:37.107
The only curious thing there
is Lynda's bed was made up neatly.

13:38.776 --> 13:43.697
[man] At that time, the disappearance
of Lynda Healy was certainly unique

13:43.781 --> 13:45.366
for the Seattle area.

13:45.783 --> 13:48.661
Back when I first started
as a patrol officer

13:49.328 --> 13:51.038
with the King County Sheriff's Office,

13:51.705 --> 13:54.291
I'd never seen a crime committed before.

13:55.709 --> 13:57.878
And that's where I got my start.

14:00.464 --> 14:04.134
We did not know anything
about where she went,

14:04.593 --> 14:08.222
nor had anyone else had any knowledge
about where she went.

14:08.305 --> 14:12.226
We have very few leads
on the disappearance of Lynda Healy.

14:12.518 --> 14:16.397
Although since the last time
that we made a press release on this,

14:16.480 --> 14:18.524
we have interviewed 65 people.

14:19.817 --> 14:22.862
We couldn't do anything
but sit and man a telephone.

14:23.863 --> 14:25.155
It was pretty bad.

14:27.157 --> 14:28.033
[click]

14:30.661 --> 14:35.374
[Michaud] Ted's first victim was supposed
by most people to be Lynda Ann Healy.

14:35.624 --> 14:40.421
And my conversations with Ted
began fairly innocently.

14:40.921 --> 14:43.507
I wanted to talk about the murders.

14:45.426 --> 14:48.512
So I asked him about the murder
of Lynda Ann Healy.

14:49.430 --> 14:52.349
[Michaud] We know that Healy
went to bed and was never seen again...

14:53.392 --> 14:57.646
I think we've got to try to think
in a more narrative kind of way,

14:57.730 --> 15:00.900
about the crimes,
with which you have been connected.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.322
-[Bundy] I don't-- I don't know. I'm...
-[Michaud chuckles]

15:07.406 --> 15:10.868
[Bundy] My initial reaction is
that I don't think that I can.

15:11.911 --> 15:15.414
It seemed to me that when he said
that he was going to cooperate with us

15:15.497 --> 15:16.707
and tell us important things

15:16.790 --> 15:18.626
that would help prove
that he was innocent,

15:19.668 --> 15:22.546
what he really had in mind
was a celebrity bio.

15:23.505 --> 15:26.800
[Bundy] Boyhood on Sheridan Street
was not an unpleasant one.

15:28.510 --> 15:31.180
I remember those days,

15:31.263 --> 15:36.769
of roaming and-- with my friends,
the adventure, the explorations.

15:37.811 --> 15:41.941
Those were the days of frog hunting
and marble playing.

15:42.900 --> 15:47.863
[Michaud] Ted had
an idealized version of his boyhood.

15:48.322 --> 15:51.992
[Bundy] First grade I was somewhat
of a champion frog catcher.

15:52.076 --> 15:54.536
I mean, I was a frog man.

15:55.496 --> 15:57.414
Prided myself on my ability

15:57.498 --> 16:00.042
to spot that pair of bulging eyes...

16:01.293 --> 16:04.880
which would bob
just above the surface of a murky pond,

16:08.008 --> 16:11.303
[woman] Growing up in Tacoma,
we had a lot of fun.

16:13.430 --> 16:16.934
My brother was two years older
and he and Ted were the same age.

16:18.143 --> 16:22.189
We had about a four-block area
of kids that played together.

16:22.272 --> 16:25.985
And we had
that whole wooded area to play in.

16:26.402 --> 16:29.571
[Bundy]
I never lacked playmates in those days.

16:29.905 --> 16:33.200
There were always more than enough kids
around to do something with.

16:33.283 --> 16:34.785
They seemed to be everywhere.

16:35.244 --> 16:38.789
There was a distinct difference
between the haves and have-nots

16:38.872 --> 16:39.915
in the neighborhood,

16:39.999 --> 16:43.377
and Ted's family
were in the have-not group.

16:45.004 --> 16:50.050
But they could have not been
more Beaver Cleaver if they tried.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.595
His mom worked as a secretary.

16:54.430 --> 16:56.348
Mr. Bundy was a really good dad.

16:56.849 --> 17:00.853
His mom and dad took him
to church every Sunday.

17:00.936 --> 17:03.647
They were involved
in Cub Scouts and Brownies

17:03.731 --> 17:05.733
and Girl Scouts and Boy Scouts, and...

17:06.233 --> 17:08.318
sent the kids to church camps.

17:08.402 --> 17:11.530
They were very, very involved parents.

17:13.282 --> 17:15.701
But he was just different.

17:17.661 --> 17:21.457
He had a big problem for a long time.
He had a horrible speech impediment.

17:21.540 --> 17:23.250
So he was teased a lot.

17:25.294 --> 17:27.046
He just didn't fit in.

17:28.047 --> 17:29.673
Even up at Boy Scout camp,

17:29.757 --> 17:32.509
he just couldn't
quite get the hang of doing

17:32.593 --> 17:34.595
the things the other kids were doing.

17:35.387 --> 17:37.222
Couldn't tie the knots right.

17:37.639 --> 17:39.349
Couldn't shoot the gun right.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.643
Couldn't win the races.

17:42.853 --> 17:45.022
And he had a temper.

17:45.856 --> 17:47.024
He liked to scare people.

17:48.734 --> 17:52.362
He liked building tiger traps
out in the woods.

17:53.739 --> 17:55.699
They built a bit pit in the ground

17:55.783 --> 17:58.452
and put sharpened sticks down in it,

17:58.535 --> 18:01.371
then covered the top of it up
with vegetation.

18:01.997 --> 18:03.457
And one little girl

18:04.124 --> 18:06.460
went over the top
of one of Ted's tiger traps

18:06.543 --> 18:08.962
and got the whole side of her leg...

18:09.546 --> 18:14.384
slit open with the sharpened point
of the stick that she landed on.

18:17.429 --> 18:18.722
In high school,

18:19.098 --> 18:21.683
he wanted to be something he wasn't.

18:21.767 --> 18:23.435
He was going to be president.

18:23.519 --> 18:25.646
He was going to show the world that...

18:26.021 --> 18:28.398
Ted was the one to be dealt with,

18:28.482 --> 18:30.984
and it was a lot of blowhard talk.

18:31.527 --> 18:34.863
[Bundy] I did well in academics,
I ran for high school office.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.366
Most of my close friends,
we would play football

18:37.449 --> 18:40.244
I went out for the track team,
went skiing every weekend.

18:40.327 --> 18:41.703
I was one of the boys.

18:42.621 --> 18:45.624
[Holt] He tried to fool you
and lie to you.

18:45.707 --> 18:47.417
He wasn't athletic.

18:47.501 --> 18:51.255
He wanted to be the number one in class,
but he wasn't.

18:51.797 --> 18:55.175
He started being more alone.

18:55.759 --> 18:58.679
[Bundy] Some people perceived me
as being shy and introverted.

18:58.762 --> 19:03.475
I didn't go to dances,
I didn't go on the beer drinking outings.

19:03.559 --> 19:06.311
I was a pretty--
You might call me straight,

19:06.395 --> 19:10.023
-but not a social outcast in any way.
-[Michaud] Mm-hmm.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.902
[Holt] Nobody really got
to be close to Ted.

19:13.986 --> 19:16.446
I don't remember him dating anybody,

19:16.530 --> 19:19.700
and at the time
I thought it was really terrible,

19:19.783 --> 19:21.410
'cause he was a good-looking guy.

19:22.077 --> 19:24.496
[Bundy] It wasn't that I disliked women
or were afraid of them.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.540
It was just that I didn't seem to...

19:26.623 --> 19:29.626
have an inkling as to
what to do about them.

19:31.044 --> 19:33.088
[calmly] I honestly can't say why.

19:34.673 --> 19:38.802
He just didn't seem to be all there,
all present...

19:40.095 --> 19:43.348
in some way. There was just a gap in him.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.936
[Bundy] Everybody's fascinated

19:48.020 --> 19:51.398
with the notion
that there is cause and effect.

19:51.815 --> 19:53.525
That we can put our finger on it and say,

19:53.609 --> 19:56.195
"Yes, his father beat him
when he was a boy.

19:56.278 --> 19:57.863
We could see it when he was a kid."

19:58.322 --> 19:59.698
That's bullshit.

20:00.824 --> 20:02.743
There's nothing in my background

20:02.826 --> 20:05.329
which would lead one to believe
that I was capable

20:05.412 --> 20:06.705
of committing murder.

20:07.831 --> 20:10.626
-[Michaud] Absolutely nothing?
-[Bundy] Absolutely nothing.

20:32.981 --> 20:35.776
[McChesney] In June of 1974,

20:36.109 --> 20:39.363
another young woman went missing
in Seattle.

20:40.739 --> 20:44.326
And she had lived
in the University of Washington area,

20:44.660 --> 20:47.788
very close to where Lynda Ann Healy
had been abducted.

20:50.624 --> 20:53.252
[female report] Georgann Hawkins
was last seen Monday evening

20:53.335 --> 20:54.753
shortly after midnight.

20:55.671 --> 20:58.924
She had been visiting at the Beta House
and was returning to her house

20:59.007 --> 21:02.135
just a half block away down this alley.

21:02.219 --> 21:05.555
Police believe she went along this route

21:05.639 --> 21:07.724
and then, somewhere, she disappeared.

21:07.808 --> 21:10.352
Did you ever know her
as the type of person that would take off

21:10.435 --> 21:12.479
at any time on her own
and not tell anyone?

21:12.562 --> 21:14.773
No, I didn't, she wasn't like that at all.

21:14.856 --> 21:16.900
She always...
She was really close to all of us,

21:16.984 --> 21:19.444
and anything she was gonna do,
she always told us.

21:19.528 --> 21:22.406
Because she lived in the University
of Washington area,

21:22.489 --> 21:24.825
where you have lots and lots
of young people,

21:24.908 --> 21:26.743
and lots of lots of young women,

21:26.827 --> 21:30.831
the community began to grow uneasy
about what was going on.

21:31.164 --> 21:33.917
It's unreal and it's a nightmare.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.045
And nothing in anybody's manual would...
[chuckles]

21:37.462 --> 21:40.382
it-- would prepare you
for something like this.

21:40.465 --> 21:44.303
Mostly they're-- they're frightened,
and I-I sense a good deal of anger.

21:45.679 --> 21:48.181
-[reporter] Against who?
-Against anyone who would feel

21:48.265 --> 21:51.685
they had the right to walk
into the middle of a young lady's life

21:51.768 --> 21:53.603
and-- and disrupt it in this way.

21:56.148 --> 21:59.359
[McChesney] It was very obvious to me

21:59.443 --> 22:04.197
that there was something really horrible,
really wrong going on.

22:04.614 --> 22:06.700
There's no physical evidence,
except that the two girls

22:06.783 --> 22:08.827
were very similar type girls.
They're very dependable.

22:08.910 --> 22:11.371
They told people where they were going
and when they were coming back,

22:11.997 --> 22:14.499
and that, uh, they just didn't do things
of this nature.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.501
And they're within two blocks
of each other.

22:16.585 --> 22:19.254
Police say they will return
to this alley at night

22:19.338 --> 22:21.548
to determine the lighting of the area.

22:21.631 --> 22:24.718
Meanwhile, they're asking the girls
to stay out of the alleys

22:24.801 --> 22:27.220
and travel in groups of twos or threes

22:27.304 --> 22:29.056
and use only the front doors.

22:30.474 --> 22:33.393
[Michaud]
The disappearance of Georgann Hawkins

22:33.477 --> 22:36.021
is an interesting case.

22:36.104 --> 22:39.691
for the fact there's no evidence, at all.

22:40.150 --> 22:43.528
She might be an interesting one
to discuss, what do you think?

22:44.029 --> 22:45.739
Well, I don't know about, uh...

22:47.240 --> 22:48.909
the Hawkins case,

22:49.284 --> 22:52.329
from what I know about it, it is unusual.

22:52.746 --> 22:54.206
because she was in a neighborhood

22:54.289 --> 22:56.583
where she would have
a lot of acquaintances

22:56.666 --> 22:58.502
but I don't know.

23:00.337 --> 23:02.297
[Michaud]
Guiding the conversations with Ted

23:02.381 --> 23:03.507
was a challenge.

23:04.007 --> 23:08.595
I started trying to push him
into more substantive areas and...

23:08.970 --> 23:10.514
he just kept bobbing and weaving.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.143
He wanted to talk about everything
but the cases against him.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.439
He told me that when he graduated
from high school,

23:19.523 --> 23:21.733
he went to the University of Washington.

23:31.118 --> 23:34.621
[Bundy] At the University of Washington,
I was a nice, presentable,

23:34.704 --> 23:35.831
affable young person.

23:37.999 --> 23:43.171
I compensated a lot for what I consider
to be my most vulnerable aspect,

23:43.255 --> 23:44.464
my introversion,

23:44.548 --> 23:49.344
by being seemingly aloof
and arrogant and intellectual

23:49.428 --> 23:53.056
but nice and tolerant
and that kind of stuff.

23:53.557 --> 23:56.268
I had to sit down one night and say,
"This is what I want to be."

23:58.645 --> 23:59.855
[Michaud] At the university,

23:59.938 --> 24:02.774
he got an undergraduate degree
in psychology

24:03.066 --> 24:06.069
and also met this tall, attractive,

24:06.153 --> 24:08.655
wealthy young woman from California...

24:09.531 --> 24:12.451
and for a while caught her attention.

24:13.410 --> 24:15.412
[Bundy] The relationship I had with Diane

24:15.745 --> 24:18.248
had a lasting impact on me.

24:18.832 --> 24:25.172
She's a beautiful dresser, beautiful girl.
Very personable. Nice car, great parents.

24:25.255 --> 24:26.339
So, you know,

24:26.882 --> 24:31.720
for the first-time girlfriend,
really that was not too bad.

24:32.804 --> 24:35.932
We spent a lot of time driving around
in her car.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.643
You know, making out in the car.

24:39.436 --> 24:41.771
Mumbled sweet nothings
into each other's ears

24:41.855 --> 24:44.024
and told each other how much we loved
each other.

24:45.108 --> 24:51.031
And she inspired me to look at myself
and become something more.

24:51.948 --> 24:54.493
[Michaud] He decided that he wanted
to go into politics

24:54.576 --> 24:57.496
and he was a straightforward,
clean-cut, foursquare

24:57.579 --> 24:59.581
Richard-Nixon Republican.

25:01.291 --> 25:03.126
[crowd cheering]

25:07.881 --> 25:11.092
[Nixon] Four years ago,
crime was rising all over America.

25:11.718 --> 25:13.929
I pledge to stop the rise in crime.

25:17.057 --> 25:20.268
[Bundy]
I've always been anti-union, anti-boycott.

25:20.352 --> 25:23.271
I guess that kind of labels me
as somewhat of a conservative.

25:25.023 --> 25:28.777
[Michaud] The anti-war movement
and the liberal agenda offended him.

25:28.860 --> 25:31.488
[Bundy]
I just wasn't too fond of criminal conduct

25:31.571 --> 25:35.283
and using anti-war movements
as a haven for...

25:35.700 --> 25:41.122
for delinquents who liked to feel
that they were immune from the law.

25:41.206 --> 25:44.084
I did speak out
against these radical socialist types

25:44.167 --> 25:46.878
who were just all
for trashing the buildings,

25:46.962 --> 25:48.672
and destroying the university.

25:53.218 --> 25:54.844
[man] When I first met Ted,

25:54.928 --> 25:58.932
he was doing work for the state
Republican Party at that time

25:59.391 --> 26:00.642
in Seattle.

26:01.017 --> 26:03.478
I got a job working
for Republican governor

26:03.562 --> 26:05.647
Dan Evans' campaign for reelection.

26:05.730 --> 26:10.277
And Ted volunteered
to come on and work with us.

26:12.654 --> 26:14.322
Our friendship grew from there.

26:15.198 --> 26:16.616
He was a very nice person.

26:17.117 --> 26:19.953
He was the kind of guy
you'd want your sister to marry.

26:23.665 --> 26:26.167
[Michaud] One of the things
Ted liked about politics

26:26.251 --> 26:28.628
is that politicians are all about image.

26:28.712 --> 26:31.673
They're about selling something
to do the public.

26:32.007 --> 26:34.509
That's perfect for him,
'cause he doesn't have to be real.

26:34.593 --> 26:36.344
[Bundy] The reason I love politics

26:36.428 --> 26:38.888
and was just drawn to it
from the very beginning

26:38.972 --> 26:42.183
was because here was something
which allowed me

26:42.267 --> 26:45.020
to utilize my natural talent in politics

26:45.103 --> 26:47.188
and also my assertiveness.

26:47.272 --> 26:49.733
[Vortman]
Ted always fit in, wherever he was at.

26:50.317 --> 26:52.819
We would go to functions

26:53.111 --> 26:55.697
where there'd be
some very influential people there.

26:56.281 --> 26:59.534
And, uh,
Ted could always strike up a dialogue.

27:00.243 --> 27:02.037
These people accepted him.

27:02.704 --> 27:05.498
[Bundy] And a social life.
I mean, the social life came with it.

27:05.582 --> 27:08.418
You were set, you know,
you went out to dinner with people

27:08.501 --> 27:10.754
and they invited you to dinner,
this is where they were,

27:10.837 --> 27:12.797
they took you to drinks, and they...

27:12.881 --> 27:17.302
And there I was,
a life that had been missing for me.

27:17.385 --> 27:20.138
During that campaign
I got laid for the first time.

27:20.221 --> 27:22.557
I got laid in Walla Walla.

27:23.141 --> 27:25.852
[Vortman]
Ted's job with the governor's campaign

27:25.935 --> 27:29.939
was to attend all of the events
that Rosellini had--

27:30.023 --> 27:33.360
the other side, a democrat
running against Governor Evans--

27:33.860 --> 27:37.405
and write down what Rosellini said
to use it against him.

27:38.490 --> 27:41.284
[Michaud] Ted saw himself
as something more

27:41.368 --> 27:44.954
than just another guy
who was just working on the campaign.

27:45.038 --> 27:47.582
[newsman] An official for the Republican
gubernatorial candidate

27:47.666 --> 27:49.876
was accused of political spying.

27:49.959 --> 27:52.337
It's hard for me to believe
that what I did is newsworthy.

27:52.420 --> 27:54.756
My part in the campaign
was so insignificant,

27:54.839 --> 27:57.759
I'm embarrassed that I should be getting
this publicity from it.

27:57.842 --> 27:59.135
Really embarrassed.

27:59.219 --> 28:00.178
[laughs]

28:00.261 --> 28:04.974
[Michaud] He affected humility at it,
that he was just another little cog.

28:05.058 --> 28:07.519
But he, in fact, loved to be
in the center of attention.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.399
[Vortman]
Ted had aspirations to be affluent

28:12.482 --> 28:14.609
and recognized and looked up to.

28:15.276 --> 28:18.238
I did meet his girlfriend from California.

28:18.321 --> 28:19.656
She was a very classy person.

28:21.282 --> 28:25.328
And Ted wanted to be in the upper class.

28:27.455 --> 28:28.915
I think he looked up to me.

28:29.457 --> 28:32.293
I was like the big brother,
the older brother.

28:32.377 --> 28:34.045
And we have the same interests.

28:34.671 --> 28:36.673
He enjoyed cooking and eating.

28:36.756 --> 28:38.758
I like to cook. That's sort of my hobby.

28:39.634 --> 28:40.719
[Bundy] When I met Marlin,

28:40.802 --> 28:43.888
I was attracted to him because his wife
could cook good sushi.

28:44.347 --> 28:47.475
And, uh, they were very nice people.

28:48.560 --> 28:50.353
[Vortman] Ted liked my Volkswagen.

28:51.187 --> 28:53.606
He wanted a Volkswagen just like mine.

28:55.150 --> 28:59.195
And I remember he liked
that it had a grab bar up here.

29:00.447 --> 29:02.532
He seemed intrigued by that.

29:03.658 --> 29:05.827
And then he got one just like mine,

29:05.910 --> 29:07.746
I guess, same color and everything.

29:08.830 --> 29:11.207
And I was going to law school

29:11.291 --> 29:14.753
and Ted decided he was gonna go out
to law school too.

29:22.552 --> 29:25.638
[Michaud] After he graduated
from the University of Washington,

29:25.722 --> 29:27.974
Ted applied to a number of law schools,

29:28.641 --> 29:32.353
but he was devastated
when his LSATs came back

29:32.437 --> 29:35.064
and he was mediocre.
They weren't very good at all.

29:35.690 --> 29:38.318
So, he was not going to get
into a great law school.

29:38.610 --> 29:42.822
And he goes to the University
of Puget Sound Law School, night school.

29:43.907 --> 29:45.575
[Bundy] I felt like I'd failed,

29:45.992 --> 29:50.371
not only myself but even my teachers
and instructors at the university.

29:50.747 --> 29:52.749
[Michaud] And he's bitterly disappointed,

29:52.832 --> 29:56.920
because it lacks any kind of mahogany
and tweed that he had in mind.

29:57.295 --> 29:58.797
And it was a miserable year for him.

30:00.840 --> 30:04.177
[Bundy] I was just absolutely
out of control of my life.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.097
I didn't know what I was going to do,
didn't even know where I was gonna live.

30:08.181 --> 30:10.809
Didn't even know
how I was gonna support myself.

30:12.852 --> 30:15.772
[Michaud] And his relationship
with Diane falls apart.

30:16.523 --> 30:18.650
She was frankly more woman
than he could handle.

30:19.484 --> 30:21.986
He didn't have any money,
and that kind of opened up

30:22.070 --> 30:23.822
a lot of the old self-doubt.

30:24.155 --> 30:27.200
[Bundy] I experienced
any number of insecurities with Diane.

30:27.867 --> 30:31.496
There were occasions when I felt
that she expected a great deal more

30:31.579 --> 30:34.332
from me
than I was really capable of giving.

30:34.415 --> 30:40.088
I was not in any position to take her out
and squire her around, uh...

30:40.171 --> 30:42.423
in the manner in which we was accustomed.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.677
But-- Or buy her clothing or, you know...

30:46.803 --> 30:49.764
I think I was coming apart at the seams.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.725
Maybe she saw it
and maybe didn't understand, you know,

30:52.809 --> 30:54.102
what I was going through.

30:55.478 --> 30:59.107
Throughout the summer,
Diane and I corresponded less and less.

30:59.190 --> 31:01.609
And then Diane stopped writing, and...

31:01.985 --> 31:05.321
and I started to get fearful
about what she was up to.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.658
I had
this overwhelming feeling of rejection

31:08.741 --> 31:10.493
that stemmed not just her, but...

31:11.411 --> 31:12.495
everything.

31:13.371 --> 31:15.957
The tail end of that summer
is really a blank,

31:16.040 --> 31:17.876
I mean, it was a nightmare for me.

31:19.043 --> 31:21.462
In there somewhere was a desire to...

31:22.255 --> 31:24.591
have some sort of revenge on Diane.

31:26.259 --> 31:30.013
But toward the end of the summer,
I'm serious, I just-- It's blank.

31:31.097 --> 31:32.640
I don't know what the hell I did.

31:37.770 --> 31:39.689
[male reporter]
From January to June of this year,

31:39.772 --> 31:42.734
The King County area
was engulfed in a wave of fear

31:42.817 --> 31:45.778
as young women vanished
with alarming regularity.

31:45.862 --> 31:49.157
21-year-old Lynda Ann Healy
was the first to disappear.

31:49.240 --> 31:53.119
Georgann Hawkins also disappeared
from the University of Washington campus.

31:54.746 --> 31:57.415
[Michaud] When Lynda Healy
and Georgann Hawkins disappeared

31:57.498 --> 31:59.042
within the city of Seattle,

31:59.334 --> 32:01.711
they were missing persons cases,
they were not murders.

32:01.794 --> 32:05.131
They just have gone.
There was no region-wide panic...

32:05.715 --> 32:07.759
until word spread that four other women

32:07.842 --> 32:10.762
had also disappeared
from other jurisdictions,

32:10.845 --> 32:14.599
all around Western Washington
and into Northern Oregon.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.852
[male reporter] Nearly every month,
in and around Seattle,

32:17.936 --> 32:19.854
a young woman disappeared.

32:20.271 --> 32:21.898
[male reporter #2] Gail Manson disappeared

32:21.981 --> 32:24.651
from The Evergreen State College campus
near Olympia.

32:24.734 --> 32:27.236
Susan Rancourt disappeared
from the campus

32:27.320 --> 32:29.864
of central Washington State College
in Ellensburg.

32:30.281 --> 32:32.241
Roberta Kathleen Parks disappeared

32:32.325 --> 32:35.203
from the Oregon State University campus
at Corvallis.

32:35.286 --> 32:40.291
22-year-old Brenda Ball of Seattle
was last seen at a tavern in Burien.

32:41.209 --> 32:43.586
There were six
unsolved disappearances here

32:43.670 --> 32:45.129
in less than six months.

32:51.094 --> 32:54.555
[man] When the series of girls
were reported missing,

32:54.973 --> 32:56.641
terror gripped Seattle.

32:59.936 --> 33:02.021
I was a reporter for KJR Radio

33:02.563 --> 33:05.441
and the desperation in Seattle was crazy.

33:05.525 --> 33:07.193
The people were frightened to death.

33:07.402 --> 33:10.989
We had started, at KJR,
numbering the women.

33:11.072 --> 33:13.491
"Number 3, number 4,
number 5 has disappeared."

33:13.574 --> 33:14.450
"Number 6..."

33:15.952 --> 33:18.746
Women were disappearing,
and my brother had sent me

33:18.830 --> 33:20.915
the clippings from the paper.

33:20.999 --> 33:23.710
It just made me sick.

33:24.460 --> 33:25.586
[Vortman] It was on the news.

33:25.670 --> 33:29.173
There were a bunch of young women
missing in the Seattle area.

33:29.257 --> 33:31.759
I was shocked. I couldn't believe it.

33:32.051 --> 33:34.053
They just vanish for no apparent reason.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.598
We are pretty sure
that there is probably foul play

33:37.682 --> 33:38.975
some way or another.

33:39.058 --> 33:42.311
And we feel that we haven't come
to the end of our line here,

33:42.395 --> 33:46.024
that there's a good possibility
that this could happen again.

33:47.567 --> 33:49.277
[Lucas] It was an emotional time.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.738
Behavior was changed.
A lot of behavior changed.

33:52.113 --> 33:55.867
There had been young men, young women
hitchhiking on every street corner.

33:55.950 --> 33:57.618
And the hitchhiking stopped.

33:58.077 --> 33:59.120
Just like that.

33:59.203 --> 34:02.165
We just want to caution
the young women of our community

34:02.248 --> 34:05.084
to be overly cautious at this time.

34:08.588 --> 34:11.424
[McChesney] As a woman, and a detective,

34:11.507 --> 34:14.635
it was not lost on me
that the victim pool was....

34:15.762 --> 34:17.305
kind of like me...

34:17.764 --> 34:20.349
in the sense of age, college-educated.

34:20.683 --> 34:25.730
And for most of the women that I knew,
they were very careful about...

34:25.813 --> 34:30.109
meeting strangers and dating
and who they were dating and so forth.

34:30.193 --> 34:35.823
And I knew from my friends
that there was apprehension and fear

34:35.907 --> 34:40.078
about what was going on,
because we did not have a suspect.

34:40.495 --> 34:43.331
All the material that was coming out
of the Seattle Police Department was:

34:43.414 --> 34:46.459
"We don't know what's going on.
We don't know...

34:46.542 --> 34:48.795
where these girls are disappearing to.
We have no suspect."

34:49.253 --> 34:50.963
[man] Information is coming in, but...

34:51.839 --> 34:54.634
it isn't anything
that we can really go on right now.

34:55.593 --> 34:57.178
[dogs barking]

34:58.346 --> 35:01.933
[Keppel] Brenda Ball
was my missing person case.

35:02.350 --> 35:05.561
I worked very hard
at trying to locate her.

35:05.978 --> 35:09.107
Didn't find out any information
from anybody that knew anything.

35:10.108 --> 35:12.902
We were viewing the type of case it was

35:12.985 --> 35:17.073
as a killer or maybe a couple of killers.

35:17.156 --> 35:19.367
The term "serial killer"

35:19.826 --> 35:24.997
was not anywhere on anybody's register
in 1970s.

35:25.540 --> 35:28.209
As far as I was concerned,
it was new territory.

35:28.793 --> 35:31.921
We didn't know what was going on at all.

35:33.589 --> 35:35.967
[Bundy] The record-keeping operation

35:36.050 --> 35:39.679
of the King County police agencies
in general was just horrendous.

35:40.638 --> 35:43.391
I had this connection
with law enforcement there.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.810
I worked for the Seattle Crime Commission.

35:47.186 --> 35:49.814
I did some work
on this crimes against women...

35:49.897 --> 35:52.024
uh, issue, particularly rape...

35:52.942 --> 35:55.069
to study this and make some suggestions

35:55.153 --> 35:57.780
to the Seattle police
on how they can prevent rape.

35:58.197 --> 36:00.950
[Michaud] A year or so
before the women started disappearing,

36:01.033 --> 36:05.204
Ted had a brief job
working for the Seattle Crime Commission.

36:06.164 --> 36:10.334
It gave him access
to a lot of crime statistics,

36:10.751 --> 36:12.920
and he saw what the police did
and what the police did not do.

36:13.671 --> 36:17.383
And he saw all sorts of places
where somebody who was smart enough

36:17.466 --> 36:21.262
could take advantage of the chaos
and the lack of consistency

36:21.345 --> 36:23.764
from one jurisdiction to another.

36:25.266 --> 36:27.685
[Bundy] What I discovered,
the discovery I made

36:27.768 --> 36:29.979
was that they had well-intentioned people,

36:30.062 --> 36:32.064
but they didn't know what they should do.

36:34.108 --> 36:36.527
[Lucas] Various police departments
weren't sharing information

36:36.611 --> 36:38.321
across jurisdictional lines.

36:38.696 --> 36:42.533
This became blatantly obvious
fairly early on in the series of murders.

36:42.617 --> 36:45.036
I'd call the police department and say,
"How many girls are you missing?"

36:45.661 --> 36:48.039
"We have one missing here."
And I said, "How many in Seattle?"

36:48.122 --> 36:49.290
"I don't know."

36:50.249 --> 36:53.211
There were wild investigative leads
that went all over the place.

36:54.295 --> 36:57.256
The Captain of Homicide in Seattle,
Herbs Swinley,

36:57.340 --> 37:00.134
would call me into his office sometimes
to brainstorm.

37:00.551 --> 37:02.803
One day, I walked into his office
and up on the chalkboard,

37:02.887 --> 37:04.388
he had the names of...

37:04.805 --> 37:06.015
[exhales]

37:06.098 --> 37:08.601
eight or ten young women.

37:09.101 --> 37:10.311
And I said, "What's that list?"

37:10.394 --> 37:12.355
And he said,
"I was gonna ask you to look at it."

37:13.105 --> 37:16.651
And in between each of the names,
he had the numbers 23, 23,

37:16.734 --> 37:18.945
36, 36, 23,

37:19.028 --> 37:20.780
23, 36, 36.

37:21.197 --> 37:23.866
I said, "I don't know,
what's that all about?"

37:23.950 --> 37:27.328
And he said, "That's the number of days
between the disappearances."

37:27.411 --> 37:28.704
He said: "You see a pattern?"

37:30.122 --> 37:32.458
He was researching
various religious cults

37:32.541 --> 37:36.712
to try to attach it to various kinds
of occult calendars, and...

37:37.171 --> 37:40.258
witchcraft, Satanism, human sacrifices.

37:41.008 --> 37:43.511
They had no hard evidence.

37:43.594 --> 37:45.805
No descriptions of potential suspects.

37:46.430 --> 37:47.390
They were desperate.

37:59.110 --> 38:02.822
[Aynesworth] While Stephen
was meeting with Ted in prison,

38:03.572 --> 38:05.366
I was out in the Northwest

38:05.449 --> 38:09.453
reinvestigating all the murders
that he was suspected of.

38:10.997 --> 38:12.915
Six years after these murders,

38:12.999 --> 38:15.501
there really wasn't
any real strong evidence

38:15.584 --> 38:17.169
in any of the cases.

38:19.046 --> 38:23.259
I met with the local police,
what witnesses there were of the crimes,

38:24.135 --> 38:25.261
their families

38:25.636 --> 38:28.097
Well, we received a phone call
from the university

38:28.180 --> 38:32.143
that my daughter was missing.
That she hadn't come home.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.938
She was a straight-A student,
the type of child who just...

38:36.022 --> 38:38.107
wouldn't normally do
those kinds of things.

38:38.733 --> 38:40.818
Those things don't happen to you.

38:40.901 --> 38:42.445
They happen to everybody else.

38:43.279 --> 38:46.365
You read about in the paper.
They happen in New York City.

38:46.449 --> 38:49.327
They don't happen
in Ellensburg, Washington.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.581
It was just a hard, tiresome job

38:53.664 --> 38:57.209
for many weeks
and it was very-- very hurtful too,

38:57.293 --> 38:59.837
because some of these families

38:59.920 --> 39:02.715
never found their daughters.

39:03.466 --> 39:06.177
I had two teenage daughters at the time.

39:06.719 --> 39:08.220
And I just envisioned...

39:09.013 --> 39:11.807
what had happened to some of these girls.
It was horrible.

39:15.644 --> 39:19.982
[Bundy] Why and how an individual
would select women as victims

39:20.066 --> 39:24.737
of a brutal crime
is not entirely clear to me.

39:26.906 --> 39:29.575
I've always preferred women to men.

39:30.034 --> 39:32.078
Um, I probably have

39:32.161 --> 39:34.080
60% women friends,

39:34.163 --> 39:37.833
close to 40% men friends.
It's always been divided that way.

39:37.917 --> 39:39.126
I enjoy women.

39:43.714 --> 39:46.300
[Michaud]
Ted presented himself as just a Boy Scout.

39:46.384 --> 39:48.886
Boyishly handsome, smooth-talking,

39:49.261 --> 39:50.971
and people really fell for him.

39:51.430 --> 39:56.560
He met a woman named Liz at a bar
and she fell madly in love with him.

39:56.644 --> 40:01.065
Liz became his main squeeze,
and they almost got married.

40:03.150 --> 40:06.779
[Bundy] I loved her so much it.
It was destabilizing.

40:08.531 --> 40:11.867
She was from a Mormon family.
She was from a wealthy background.

40:12.576 --> 40:14.120
She was somewhat meek.

40:15.204 --> 40:19.250
Liz had a child
that she had to raise alone for a time.

40:19.959 --> 40:21.127
[Michaud] She had a daughter,

40:21.585 --> 40:24.922
and they formed
this kind of little family for a while.

40:25.840 --> 40:28.259
[Bundy] She was new,
and this was a whole new...

40:28.342 --> 40:29.176
[clears throat]

40:29.260 --> 40:32.179
...dimension to living
that I had never seen before.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.306
[Michaud] But they had issues.

40:35.015 --> 40:37.810
[Bundy] I felt such a strong love for her.

40:37.893 --> 40:40.688
But we didn't have a lot
of interests in common--

40:40.771 --> 40:44.066
Like, politics was something
I don't think we had in common.

40:44.859 --> 40:47.319
She liked to read a lot,
I wasn't into reading.

40:47.403 --> 40:49.071
I wasted a lot of time.

40:49.822 --> 40:52.533
And the other problems
that I would experience, like...

40:52.616 --> 40:57.204
not being able to make
my genuine feelings for her come out,

40:57.746 --> 41:01.041
whether it's fixing a special dinner
or going out

41:01.125 --> 41:04.503
or bringing flowers
or taking out the garbage,

41:04.587 --> 41:06.964
changing the sheets, or doing the laundry.

41:07.047 --> 41:10.301
On occasion I would experience
this fit of, you know...

41:11.302 --> 41:14.180
guilt as it were, and I would vacuum,
and I would straighten up

41:14.263 --> 41:16.974
and wash dishes or fix dinner
or do something.

41:18.350 --> 41:21.437
The area where I really failed would be

41:21.770 --> 41:24.315
not opening up my whole life to her.

41:25.357 --> 41:26.650
Don't know what I was hiding.

41:28.319 --> 41:30.488
Maybe I was just trying
to preserve the, uh,

41:30.571 --> 41:34.575
Ted Bundy devil-may-care
attractive bachelor image.

41:35.326 --> 41:36.243
[gunshot]

41:37.286 --> 41:39.121
I was terribly jealous of her.

41:40.331 --> 41:43.667
I used to agonize about losing her.

41:45.085 --> 41:47.379
I used to just torture myself.

41:50.007 --> 41:52.176
And I did a lot of dumb things.

42:06.815 --> 42:08.817
[indistinct chatter]

42:13.781 --> 42:15.783
[band playing upbeat song]

42:24.542 --> 42:26.669
[McChesney]
It was a beautiful Sunday afternoon.

42:31.298 --> 42:34.093
There were thousands of people
at the park.

42:38.138 --> 42:41.183
There were all kinds of events going on.

42:43.978 --> 42:45.813
Lots and lots of young people.

42:46.981 --> 42:48.607
Lots and lots of young women...

42:50.734 --> 42:52.778
in a place where they feel safe.

42:55.781 --> 42:57.950
And then...

42:58.409 --> 42:59.785
at some point that day

43:00.744 --> 43:04.623
two women, Denise Naslund and Janice Ott,

43:04.707 --> 43:07.001
disappeared from Lake Sammamish Park.

43:07.084 --> 43:09.086
[siren wailing]

43:14.633 --> 43:17.761
[Lucas]
I was still at the radio station in 1974

43:17.845 --> 43:19.680
when Janice Ott and Denise Naslund

43:19.763 --> 43:22.057
were abducted
from Lake Sammamish State Park.

43:22.141 --> 43:23.350
[inhales deeply]

43:23.434 --> 43:27.605
[sighs] I, in fact, lived in a house
just a couple miles down the road.

43:28.188 --> 43:31.692
So when the boss called and said,
"Get over-- Get over to Lake Sammamish,"

43:31.775 --> 43:34.236
I went over and began
interviewing people from there.

43:35.112 --> 43:38.907
It was the first time
that some really clear details came out.

43:40.826 --> 43:44.705
So far we've gotten a few good leads,
particularly on Janice Ott,

43:44.788 --> 43:46.540
the missing girl from Issaquah.

43:46.999 --> 43:48.500
As far as Denise Naslund,

43:48.584 --> 43:50.586
we're still a little bit shaky
on that yet.

43:53.839 --> 43:57.426
[Keppel] When the girls went missing
from Lake Sammamish State Park,

43:58.218 --> 44:00.596
our homicide sergeant assigned

44:01.013 --> 44:04.516
my partner and myself to the two cases.

44:07.519 --> 44:08.395
At that time,

44:08.479 --> 44:12.775
there were eight women
who went missing in and around Seattle.

44:13.817 --> 44:16.570
People were pretty frightened about it.

44:17.655 --> 44:19.865
So we set up a task force.

44:20.240 --> 44:22.451
Kathy McChesney was selected to come in

44:22.534 --> 44:28.624
because we needed
a female detective to interview females.

44:29.249 --> 44:32.252
[McChesney]
What came out of a call for information

44:32.336 --> 44:36.048
was the fact
that some of the witnesses at the park

44:36.131 --> 44:42.012
had seen a suspect approach
both of the women who went missing.

44:42.930 --> 44:45.349
With the disappearance of the Ott
and the Naslund girls

44:45.432 --> 44:47.476
on the same day, from the same state park,

44:47.559 --> 44:50.270
came the first indications
that a male subject was involved.

44:50.813 --> 44:52.898
There were 40,000 people
out here on that day

44:52.981 --> 44:55.526
and some of them had been asked
by a good-looking young man

44:55.609 --> 44:59.405
wearing an arm cast
to help load his sailboat on the car

44:59.488 --> 45:00.989
in the parking lot beyond.

45:01.448 --> 45:04.952
These same witnesses
provided information for a police sketch

45:05.035 --> 45:07.496
and recall the man with a cast
had asked several young ladies

45:07.579 --> 45:08.706
for help that day.

45:09.790 --> 45:11.667
[Keppel] We found out that Denise Naslund

45:11.750 --> 45:15.504
was laying on the beach
with three of her friends,

45:16.046 --> 45:20.676
and went back to the restroom,
which was about 60 feet.

45:21.802 --> 45:23.637
[McChesney]
And that's when this same suspect

45:23.721 --> 45:25.222
with his arm in a sling

45:25.305 --> 45:28.600
approached Denise Naslund,
standing there by the restroom,

45:28.684 --> 45:32.896
with a similar story,
and she went with him,

45:32.980 --> 45:36.400
we believe, willingly, to go help him.

45:36.692 --> 45:38.986
And then she was never seen again.

45:40.237 --> 45:44.616
[Keppel] Later on,
Denise Naslund's mother called in.

45:45.159 --> 45:47.536
And I remember interviewing the mother.

45:47.911 --> 45:50.164
[woman] About nine o'clock that night,

45:50.622 --> 45:53.876
I saw that her boyfriend came up
pulling in her car,

45:54.585 --> 45:57.296
and I knew right then
there was something wrong.

45:57.379 --> 46:00.007
And he said, "I can't find Denise."

46:01.383 --> 46:03.469
All I can think about is...

46:04.720 --> 46:06.263
what were her thoughts?

46:06.805 --> 46:08.724
How long did she suffer?

46:11.602 --> 46:14.271
And those thoughts
are with me all the time.

46:15.939 --> 46:18.942
[Keppel]
The same day Denise Naslund disappeared,

46:19.026 --> 46:23.739
a couple of women had observed
Janice Ott being approached,

46:23.822 --> 46:26.784
while she was on the beach,
by the suspect.

46:26.867 --> 46:31.497
Witnesses told us that the suspect
was seen to be driving

46:31.580 --> 46:35.334
a light brown or a tan Volkswagen bug.

46:36.376 --> 46:38.796
[Keppel] When Janice got up
from the beach

46:38.879 --> 46:40.547
to go to the car with him,

46:41.048 --> 46:45.385
she was wheeling along
her ten-speed yello Tiger bike,

46:45.469 --> 46:49.681
and then those girls overheard them
introduce each other.

46:50.390 --> 46:52.017
She said, "Hi, I'm Jan."

46:53.936 --> 46:56.939
And he said, "Hi, I'm Ted."

46:57.231 --> 46:59.817
And she was never seen again.

47:14.373 --> 47:16.542
[Michaud] After several weeks,

47:16.625 --> 47:18.710
I was not getting anywhere with Ted.

47:20.462 --> 47:22.005
I was getting frustrated.

47:22.422 --> 47:24.550
He didn't want to talk about the murders.

47:25.509 --> 47:28.887
We had made a deal with our publisher

47:29.429 --> 47:32.432
based on our reassurances
that we were going to get

47:32.516 --> 47:34.184
the real story from Ted Bundy.

47:35.561 --> 47:36.812
[young Michaud] I need to be reassured

47:36.895 --> 47:39.356
that you and I are going ahead
in good faith, I guess.

47:39.940 --> 47:42.359
Which is, you know--
Under the terms that we agreed,

47:42.442 --> 47:47.531
that were what is known
about the incidents themselves.

47:48.365 --> 47:49.366
Can you do that?

47:50.200 --> 47:53.287
[Bundy] I don't-- I don't want
to talk about that right now.

47:54.955 --> 47:57.875
-This is the defect of history.
-[Michaud] Yes.

47:57.958 --> 48:02.004
That historians have to deal with.
I guess we're all historians.

48:02.838 --> 48:04.464
I mean, talk about fiction.

48:04.548 --> 48:07.009
-That's what history is.
-[Michaud] Uh-uh.

48:07.092 --> 48:10.053
[Bundy] You never know whether historians,

48:10.137 --> 48:13.098
for one reason or another,
well-intentioned or not,

48:13.181 --> 48:15.851
are creating things
that they wish had happened

48:15.934 --> 48:18.103
or thought happened
or would like to have happened.

48:18.186 --> 48:21.607
Uh, because it satisfies
their own preconception

48:21.690 --> 48:24.192
of what they think the history
should have been.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.699
[Michaud] We were running out of time.

48:31.283 --> 48:34.036
And then I had this epiphany one night

48:34.119 --> 48:36.538
while I was drinking Scotch
and eating cheeseburgers

48:36.622 --> 48:38.206
at the Holiday Inn bar,

48:38.582 --> 48:41.084
that there may be
a different way to do this.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.296
I couldn't talk to Ted person to person.

48:44.379 --> 48:46.506
I had to give him some kind of the veil.

48:47.132 --> 48:49.509
I had to get him to talk about himself...

48:50.010 --> 48:51.428
in the third person.

48:53.138 --> 48:56.099
So I contacted Hugh, who was out West.

48:58.060 --> 49:00.354
[Aylesworth]
When Stephen came up with the idea

49:00.437 --> 49:03.732
to get him talking in the third person,
he called me.

49:03.815 --> 49:06.276
I was staying in a fleabag motel.

49:06.360 --> 49:11.031
And I remember that night it was snowing.
It was cold as-- as all get out.

49:12.115 --> 49:15.035
The motel did not have a phone
in the room.

49:15.744 --> 49:18.789
And I'm out there on a payphone
outside the motel,

49:18.872 --> 49:21.041
talking to Stephen, and I was freezing.

49:21.124 --> 49:24.336
I kept trying to get off the phone,
and he was excited

49:24.544 --> 49:28.715
and he kept saying, "We're oughta do it,"
and I thought it was a great idea.

49:28.799 --> 49:30.634
We didn't know whether it would work.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.553
[Michaud]
Hugh and I have our conversation.

49:34.680 --> 49:37.391
And I go back to the prison the next day

49:37.474 --> 49:40.018
and I say, "Ted, now,
we're not getting anywhere,

49:40.477 --> 49:41.770
but I have an idea.

49:42.354 --> 49:45.899
You know, Ted,
you got a degree in psychology,

49:45.983 --> 49:48.151
so you're trained in psychology.

49:48.235 --> 49:51.071
You're familiar with the details
of the cases.

49:51.488 --> 49:53.365
You certainly know what's been
in the newspapers.

49:53.448 --> 49:55.742
You're intelligent and you're articulate.

49:56.576 --> 49:58.537
I think one way to get at this,

49:58.954 --> 50:01.456
is to turn you into an expert witness.

50:02.040 --> 50:04.584
Why don't you tell me
what you think happened?

50:05.502 --> 50:08.171
Tell me what kind of person
would have done this."

50:10.716 --> 50:14.052
[Bundy] Well, it's not an easy question,
but... [clears throat] I think we can...

50:15.012 --> 50:16.096
speculate.

50:17.014 --> 50:18.181
[Michaud] He looked at me.

50:19.057 --> 50:21.143
There was a brief pause.

50:22.436 --> 50:24.855
But then he grabbed my tape recorder...

50:26.356 --> 50:29.651
and he pulled it to himself
and kind of cradled it

50:29.735 --> 50:33.655
and started talking into it
as if I wasn't even in the room.

50:33.739 --> 50:38.535
[Bundy] We can generally describe
manifestations of this condition

50:38.618 --> 50:42.914
of this person's being skewed
toward matters of a sexual nature

50:42.998 --> 50:45.167
-that involve violence.
-Mm-hmm.

50:45.250 --> 50:48.879
[Michaud] And he starts talking
about how do you describe

50:48.962 --> 50:51.214
what's in a river, as it flows to the sea.

50:51.840 --> 50:54.051
[Bundy]
You go to the mouth of any great river

50:54.134 --> 50:57.804
and pull out a handful of water
that's flowing from it and say,

50:57.888 --> 50:59.473
-"Where did it come from?"
-[Michaud] Mm-hmm.

50:59.556 --> 51:02.559
[Bundy] To trace it back, okay?
And this is what we're dealing with here--

51:02.642 --> 51:03.727
We're talking about

51:03.810 --> 51:05.479
microscopic events as it were,

51:05.562 --> 51:09.274
and undistinguishable,
undetectable events.

51:09.357 --> 51:12.527
The melting of a single snowflake
as it were, okay?

51:12.611 --> 51:17.449
The advent of Spring and the combination
of other forces perhaps

51:17.532 --> 51:22.871
and the ultimate result that we appreciate

51:22.954 --> 51:24.539
-which is the river itself.
-Mm-hmm.

51:24.623 --> 51:27.167
We're now talking
about the development of...

51:27.626 --> 51:29.753
like, well, behavior,

51:30.712 --> 51:31.880
murder.

51:31.963 --> 51:33.465
Okay, well, what...

51:34.007 --> 51:36.426
caused what kinds of mental functions,

51:36.510 --> 51:39.721
aberrations lay at the base of it
and how did they--

51:39.805 --> 51:41.056
Where were they given birth?

51:41.139 --> 51:43.600
Where did they result?
What were they the result of?

51:43.683 --> 51:44.893
And it's difficult...

51:45.977 --> 51:49.523
to trace it back and say,
"This is what happened."

51:51.066 --> 51:54.361
[Michaud] It was like I had unlocked
and avenue for him

51:54.444 --> 51:57.489
to finally tell this story

51:58.031 --> 52:01.368
without saying anything
that could ever be taken to court.

52:02.244 --> 52:03.954
And off he went.

52:04.454 --> 52:07.207
[Bundy] Perhaps this person hoped
that through violence,

52:07.290 --> 52:11.086
-through this violent series of acts--
-Mm-hmm.

52:11.962 --> 52:17.259
With-- With every murder
leaving a person of this type hungry.

52:17.592 --> 52:19.427
-[Michaud] Mm-hmm.
-[Bundy] Unfulfilled.

52:19.886 --> 52:23.974
But also leave him
with the obviously irrational belief

52:24.057 --> 52:27.477
that he-- the next time he did it
he would be fulfilled.

52:28.436 --> 52:30.564
And the next time he did it
he would be fulfilled.

52:30.647 --> 52:33.024
Or the next time he did it
he would be fulfilled.
