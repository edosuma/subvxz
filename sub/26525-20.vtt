00:01.349 --> 00:02.785
Previously onSupergirl...

00:02.828 --> 00:03.916
I want to be a mom.

00:03.960 --> 00:05.918
I can have a family of my own.

00:05.962 --> 00:08.443
I wanna introduce the world
to Dreamer.

00:08.486 --> 00:11.446
I want this Dreamer detained.
Now.

00:11.489 --> 00:12.403
Dreamer!

00:13.926 --> 00:15.537
I don't know
what happened to you,

00:15.580 --> 00:16.668
but I'll find out.

00:16.712 --> 00:18.279
I thought
you were in Smallville.

00:18.322 --> 00:20.020
I forgot my journal.

00:20.063 --> 00:22.022
You really look
exactly like her.

00:22.065 --> 00:24.850
People actually believe
that I attacked
the White House.

00:24.894 --> 00:28.028
I want to take Lex down
and put an end to all of this.

00:28.289 --> 00:29.768
-Let's go!
-He didn't do anything!

00:29.812 --> 00:31.248
Your children,
they just lost their father.

00:31.292 --> 00:33.946
I would hate to see them
lose their mother, too.

00:35.383 --> 00:36.688
No! Sweetheart.

00:37.341 --> 00:38.908
Lex bought a missile base?

00:39.169 --> 00:40.649
Guess we're going to Kaznia.

00:43.173 --> 00:44.653
I'm not anxious.

00:44.696 --> 00:47.656
I think
it would just be better,
faster, if I flew alone.

00:48.135 --> 00:49.701
Commercial.

00:49.745 --> 00:52.008
I designed this jet myself.
There's no faster way to fly.

00:52.052 --> 00:53.662
-Right.
-And if you want stealth,

00:53.705 --> 00:55.098
this has got
military grade cloaking.

00:55.142 --> 00:57.492
Yeah, but you don't
have to come with me.

00:57.535 --> 01:00.408
I need to look Lex in the eye
when we catch him.

01:02.192 --> 01:03.759
I need him to know it was me.

01:07.154 --> 01:08.807
Feels like
I'm back on deployment.

01:08.851 --> 01:11.593
Hey, at least that's
one upside to martial law.

01:11.636 --> 01:12.942
Maybe you feel
like you're at home.

01:12.985 --> 01:16.206
- Argh!
-You okay?

01:16.250 --> 01:17.816
Got a bum knee.

01:17.860 --> 01:19.949
It really sucks
when your body
starts breaking down.

01:19.992 --> 01:21.907
Yeah. Seriously.

01:21.951 --> 01:24.345
Sometimes I wonder
when I can't run as fast
as I used to,

01:24.388 --> 01:26.434
I'm like, "Oh, right,
I'm not 20 anymore."

01:26.477 --> 01:27.783
No one is spared.

01:28.262 --> 01:29.567
James will be.

01:31.787 --> 01:34.920
Must be strange
to have a sibling
with superpowers, huh?

01:37.184 --> 01:38.881
-Oh, hey, hang on one sec.
-Yeah.

01:40.056 --> 01:41.057
This is Alex.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.669
Yeah...

01:44.713 --> 01:46.715
I'm sorry. What?

01:48.282 --> 01:49.109
That...

01:50.110 --> 01:51.459
That fast? It...

01:53.200 --> 01:55.158
Oh... Okay, yes. Um...

01:55.202 --> 01:57.247
Okay. Thank-- Yup. Thank you.

01:57.682 --> 01:58.683
What is it?

01:58.727 --> 02:01.077
Um... I should...
I should go home.

02:01.730 --> 02:03.384
Are you okay? Who was that?

02:03.688 --> 02:05.734
That was the adoption agency.

02:06.909 --> 02:08.911
I'm gonna be a mother.

02:15.483 --> 02:18.616
When I was nine years old,
I chipped my front tooth.

02:19.226 --> 02:23.839
But I was in my school play
that weekend.

02:24.492 --> 02:26.233
I went to tell my mom that...

02:27.538 --> 02:29.279
I couldn't do it,

02:29.323 --> 02:30.933
and she just smiled at me.

02:32.587 --> 02:36.765
She had painted
her front tooth black.

02:40.769 --> 02:42.553
You were always there for me

02:42.597 --> 02:44.773
and I know you always will be.

02:49.386 --> 02:50.779
I love you.

02:52.302 --> 02:54.174
Um...

02:59.744 --> 03:01.050
Secretary Lockwood?

03:02.138 --> 03:03.705
I didn't think
you were coming in today.

03:04.488 --> 03:07.056
Where are we

03:07.099 --> 03:09.232
with the criminal alien
who calls herself Dreamer?

03:10.538 --> 03:13.541
-I'm not sure what you--
-Wait a second.

03:14.890 --> 03:19.503
This is the Department of
Extra-Normal Operations,
is it not?

03:19.547 --> 03:22.463
What do we...
what do we do here

03:22.506 --> 03:25.466
at the Department
of Extra-Normal Operations?

03:25.509 --> 03:27.337
We monitor Extra-Normal--

03:27.381 --> 03:30.035
No, no, no!
Aliens. Right? That was your...

03:30.079 --> 03:32.168
You were gonna say alien.
Well, you're correct.

03:32.212 --> 03:34.562
And Dreamer is an alien.

03:34.605 --> 03:37.739
And these days,
we don't just monitor aliens,
we hunt them down.

03:37.782 --> 03:39.958
So, have you hunted down
Dreamer yet?
Huh? No?

03:40.002 --> 03:42.613
Okay. Here's an easy one.
What about the alien
who killed my wife?

03:44.441 --> 03:45.616
Colonel Haley--

03:45.660 --> 03:47.401
Colonel Haley isn't here. I am.

03:47.444 --> 03:49.098
All right. Listen up.

03:50.665 --> 03:52.275
An illegal alien

03:53.276 --> 03:56.497
has commandeered
your airwaves

03:56.540 --> 04:00.675
and called for an uprising
against your government.

04:01.284 --> 04:05.027
We have to find her.
We have to find out who she is.

04:05.680 --> 04:10.467
Find every human and alien
whom she is working with.

04:10.511 --> 04:12.817
And, I have an idea,
let's start with James Olsen

04:12.861 --> 04:16.168
because I would like to know
how the hell

04:18.301 --> 04:20.869
he got superpowers.

04:29.573 --> 04:30.922
Got to say, guys,
I'm not a huge fan of this.

04:33.273 --> 04:34.491
Intriguing.

04:34.535 --> 04:36.101
I should think
discovering you're inflammable

04:36.145 --> 04:37.886
would be
an emotional net-posiitve.

04:37.929 --> 04:40.323
Flame-proof.
How are you not more excited?

04:40.367 --> 04:42.804
Because
you're the exciting one.

04:42.847 --> 04:44.675
Not so mild-mannered
cub reporter

04:44.719 --> 04:46.634
turned inspirational superhero?

04:47.374 --> 04:48.940
I'm just happy to say
I knew you when.

04:48.984 --> 04:50.812
Thanks, boss.

04:50.855 --> 04:54.032
Now, I'm gonna hit you
with this and we're gonna
see what happens.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.905
And I'm gonna ask you
to turn it down because
I'm not ready for that yet.

04:57.862 --> 04:59.560
Ben Lockwood is at the DEO.

04:59.603 --> 05:01.344
But his wife's funeral
is today.

05:01.388 --> 05:03.259
I did not account for this.

05:03.303 --> 05:05.217
Alex just texted me
moments ago

05:05.261 --> 05:07.176
saying she was dealing with
a personal matter

05:07.219 --> 05:09.831
and Colonel Haley's in D.C.
trying to revoke
Ben Lockwood's clearance.

05:11.223 --> 05:12.834
It's best
I return immediately.

05:13.269 --> 05:14.357
You think you can handle him?

05:16.925 --> 05:19.754
The real question
is can he handle me?

05:21.277 --> 05:22.409
Be careful.

05:25.586 --> 05:26.413
So...

05:28.066 --> 05:30.068
-Hammer time?
-Not in the face, kiddo.

05:30.112 --> 05:31.069
Not in the face.

05:31.635 --> 05:33.985
-Mmm!
- I know, right?

05:34.029 --> 05:35.291
This plane
makes its own coffee,

05:35.335 --> 05:37.293
cleans its own toilets
and flies itself.

05:38.294 --> 05:39.687
There's no pilot?

05:39.730 --> 05:42.429
Well, humans make mistakes.
My technology doesn't.

05:46.346 --> 05:48.913
Speaking of mistakes,

05:48.957 --> 05:51.438
I should have told you
about Lex from the beginning.

05:52.613 --> 05:56.268
Trust is still
a learned skill for me.
It doesn't come naturally.

05:56.312 --> 05:58.270
Well, no matter what,

05:58.314 --> 06:00.925
we are always on the same side.

06:06.104 --> 06:08.933
Don't worry.
It's just a lightning storm.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.459
Is lightning usually purple?

06:17.507 --> 06:19.074
Get your seat belt back on.
I'm gonna land this plane.

06:24.384 --> 06:27.343
Kara... Kara, brace yourself.
We're gonna make
an emergency landing.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.390
Yeah. That's gonna be
a huge nope for me.

06:33.305 --> 06:36.439
Get your oxygen mask on, okay?
I'm gonna restart the engine.

06:39.181 --> 06:40.487
Are you kidding?

06:42.227 --> 06:43.751
Okay, I got this.

06:48.190 --> 06:49.278
I got this.

06:58.809 --> 07:00.768
Okay...
I gotta get the power back on.

07:07.557 --> 07:09.080
- Engine engaged.
-Yes.

07:09.124 --> 07:11.648
Autopilot rebooting.
Manual landing required.

07:11.692 --> 07:12.997
Seriously?

07:27.272 --> 07:28.752
Oh, my God. Kara.

07:28.796 --> 07:29.797
Kara.

07:31.625 --> 07:32.539
Kara.

07:33.235 --> 07:34.758
Kara, you okay?

07:34.802 --> 07:37.544
I must have passed out.

07:38.545 --> 07:39.981
God! I hate flying.

07:40.503 --> 07:42.157
That lightning wasn't natural.

07:42.200 --> 07:43.593
Someone brought us down
on purpose.

07:43.637 --> 07:46.727
Well, let's hope
we didn't ruin
the element of surprise.

07:51.296 --> 07:52.689
This is so odd.

07:53.951 --> 07:56.606
I would've thought
Lex would have
an army behind him.

08:05.354 --> 08:08.531
-Must have left days ago.
-What about the lightning?

08:08.575 --> 08:09.793
Automated system.

08:10.707 --> 08:13.231
-Very Lex.
-Where did they go?

08:22.327 --> 08:23.546
Oh, my God.

08:24.373 --> 08:27.028
What was Lex doing?
Experimenting?

08:27.942 --> 08:29.291
On aliens.

08:30.727 --> 08:33.469
He was trying to siphon
and harness their powers.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.949
He was torturing them.

08:37.081 --> 08:39.257
These all say AmerTek on them.

08:41.608 --> 08:42.739
Paper files?

08:43.610 --> 08:44.611
Seems so low-tech.

08:45.612 --> 08:47.527
She always said
you couldn't hack paper.

08:49.441 --> 08:51.966
It's Eve.
This is her handwriting.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.315
Let's start reading.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.405
Okay, well,

08:57.145 --> 08:58.538
this is
the birth mother's file.

08:58.581 --> 09:01.149
It's got her story,
it's got her medical history.

09:01.192 --> 09:03.934
Oh, my God.
She's only 17.

09:03.978 --> 09:05.501
Okay, take a breath.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.329
No, there's no time to breathe.
She's already in labor.

09:07.808 --> 09:09.810
-What?
-Yeah.

09:09.853 --> 09:12.508
She hid the pregnancy
from everybody.

09:13.161 --> 09:15.685
Usually, the birth mother
looks at prospective
parent profiles

09:15.729 --> 09:17.600
and then she chooses three.

09:17.644 --> 09:21.125
But in this case,
since she's about
to have the baby,

09:21.169 --> 09:23.214
she's only chosen one.

09:23.258 --> 09:24.520
And that's me.

09:25.129 --> 09:26.609
Alex, that's incredible.

09:26.653 --> 09:28.437
It's insane.

09:28.480 --> 09:32.136
I mean,
I have 12 hours to decide
if I want to have a child

09:32.180 --> 09:35.662
and then get to Portsmouth
where the baby
is gonna be born.

09:35.705 --> 09:39.970
Look, I filled out
the adoption application
a year ago

09:40.014 --> 09:42.146
and I haven't heard
a single word since then.

09:42.190 --> 09:43.321
Not one word.

09:43.365 --> 09:45.497
And now, all of a sudden,
I have 12 hours

09:45.541 --> 09:49.110
to make the biggest decision
in my life.

09:50.198 --> 09:52.026
Do you wanna be a mother?

09:52.069 --> 09:53.593
More than anything.

09:54.245 --> 09:55.507
Yes. Of course.

09:55.551 --> 09:59.250
I... I mean,
I left my fiancee over this.
It...

10:00.556 --> 10:01.949
She didn't wanna have kids.

10:02.732 --> 10:04.604
That's... that's so hard.

10:04.647 --> 10:08.129
I mean, the world is
completely upside down, Kelly.

10:08.172 --> 10:11.828
Lex Luthor is still out there
and I'm the one
who's supposed to catch him

10:11.872 --> 10:13.830
and then there's martial law.

10:13.874 --> 10:16.311
I mean, I can't--
How would I even get out
on the street and get diapers?

10:16.354 --> 10:18.008
I will find you some diapers.

10:18.052 --> 10:19.923
It's not about the diapers.

10:19.967 --> 10:23.535
I know it's not.
But you have to take
a beat and breathe

10:23.579 --> 10:25.929
and look at the issues
one at a time.

10:25.973 --> 10:29.585
What I really need
is to be able
to talk to my sister

10:30.455 --> 10:33.371
and she's unreachable.
She's in Kaznia.

10:33.937 --> 10:36.723
Okay. If Kara was here,

10:37.898 --> 10:39.508
what would she say?

10:41.728 --> 10:42.598
Okay.

10:43.730 --> 10:46.907
If Kara was here,
she would tell me...

10:50.432 --> 10:52.477
that this has
always been my dream.

10:52.521 --> 10:54.088
And she would say

10:55.263 --> 10:58.048
that it's never gonna be
the perfect time.

10:58.092 --> 11:00.268
And that

11:00.311 --> 11:03.924
despite villains on the loose
and martial law,

11:06.100 --> 11:07.405
this is a gift

11:08.450 --> 11:12.933
and it would be sacrilege
not to accept it.

11:15.022 --> 11:16.980
Sounds like
you have your answer.

11:27.861 --> 11:30.951
I went through Haley's office.
Found some files.

11:32.082 --> 11:34.258
Lena Luthor's been working
out of the DEO.

11:34.781 --> 11:36.217
Sprock.

11:36.260 --> 11:40.090
Why? She's got a whole building
with her name on it.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.702
Maybe we'll find
some answers in her lab.

11:43.180 --> 11:44.007
Show me.

11:44.660 --> 11:45.487
Double sprock.

11:53.495 --> 11:55.627
May I be of some assistance?

11:55.671 --> 11:56.498
Open it.

11:57.325 --> 11:58.500
I can't.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.722
That's an order.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.986
Yet, it would appear that
Article 351 Section 6
of the DEO Code of Behavior

12:06.029 --> 12:08.423
does not make exceptions
for the President's cabinet.

12:08.858 --> 12:10.991
-Cooper, sidearm.

12:19.477 --> 12:22.002
Wait. This is Kopy.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.570
He attacked
that carnival last fall.
I wrote an article about him.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.529
Yeah, he could clone himself.

12:27.572 --> 12:28.791
Not exactly.

12:28.835 --> 12:30.662
He could split himself
like a cell.

12:30.706 --> 12:35.667
And, uh, each copy
was more powerful
than the original.

12:35.711 --> 12:38.018
But the longer
they were separated,
the dumber they got.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.896
Those are DEO
power-dampening cuffs.

12:48.593 --> 12:52.772
All of the test subjects here
were prisoners of
the DEO Desert Facility.

12:52.815 --> 12:54.730
That's why
Lex was spying on it.

12:55.209 --> 12:56.776
What is he building?

12:59.648 --> 13:00.997
Is someone there?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.574
Come out now
and we won't hurt you.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.582
-Eve?

13:20.625 --> 13:22.279
Kara. Lena.

13:22.976 --> 13:24.238
You found me.

13:24.586 --> 13:26.544
I was so scared.

13:31.680 --> 13:35.597
-Where's Lex?
-I saw what he was doing
to those poor aliens

13:35.640 --> 13:37.729
and I just
couldn't stand by him anymore.

13:37.773 --> 13:39.775
Cut the crap, Eva Braun.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.821
You're a backstabber
and a liar.

13:41.864 --> 13:43.953
You're right. I am lying.

13:44.432 --> 13:46.129
But I really do love you guys.

13:46.434 --> 13:47.957
I just love Lex more.

13:49.350 --> 13:50.830
I'm always
gonna be on his side.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.354
You're going to jail.

13:53.397 --> 13:55.138
But whether
it's an American prison

13:55.182 --> 13:57.097
or a Siberian
hole in the ground,

13:57.140 --> 13:58.489
is up to me right now.

13:58.533 --> 14:00.622
So, you're gonna tell us
what we wanna know.

14:00.970 --> 14:01.841
Now.

14:05.105 --> 14:07.194
Yes, I am.
I'm at the hotel.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.111
How is she feeling?
Does she know that I'm here?

14:11.154 --> 14:13.809
Oh, okay, okay, good.
Good, good, good.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.509
I see. Yeah.

14:18.553 --> 14:22.470
Yes, I understand.
Okay. Thank you.

14:26.953 --> 14:29.738
-Well?
-She's only dilated
to four centimeters

14:29.781 --> 14:32.132
so we still have
a while to wait, you know.

14:32.175 --> 14:35.526
But, um, I mean, she's...
Her vitals are good,

14:35.570 --> 14:37.006
and there's
no signs of distress,

14:37.050 --> 14:40.662
and everything is just
progressing normally.

14:40.705 --> 14:41.532
Great.

14:43.012 --> 14:45.232
Why do you look like
it's not great?

14:46.581 --> 14:50.977
She doesn't wanna see me
until after she has the baby.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.369
That's understandable.

14:52.413 --> 14:55.764
Yeah, of course.
Yeah, you're right.

14:55.807 --> 14:56.983
Of course I'm right.

14:58.201 --> 15:00.551
Now, try to relax.

15:01.596 --> 15:03.990
-Hmm.
-Eat some chocolate.

15:05.208 --> 15:07.732
What if my apartment
isn't safe for a baby?

15:07.776 --> 15:09.996
You know, I mean,
how do you know
if you have lead-based paint?

15:10.039 --> 15:10.953
That is a simple test.

15:10.997 --> 15:12.824
I've got wires everywhere.

15:12.868 --> 15:16.089
And all of my...
all of my outlets are exposed.

15:16.132 --> 15:18.004
That is totally fixable.

15:18.047 --> 15:20.702
And your baby's not gonna be
crawling anytime soon.

15:20.745 --> 15:24.575
Right, but what if it, like,
flings itself into an outlet?

15:24.619 --> 15:25.533
Do you hear yourself?

15:26.186 --> 15:27.013
Alex,

15:29.580 --> 15:30.799
you're just scared.

15:30.842 --> 15:32.235
I'm not scared.

15:33.845 --> 15:35.238
I'm terrified.

15:38.894 --> 15:40.722
Let's start with the aliens.

15:41.244 --> 15:44.334
We know you've been trying
to harness their powers. Why?

15:44.726 --> 15:45.596
I don't...

15:46.728 --> 15:47.598
Eve...

15:49.252 --> 15:50.775
Kara! Hi.

15:51.167 --> 15:53.953
You were about to tell us
about the aliens.

15:54.301 --> 15:55.519
What does Lex do to them?

15:55.563 --> 15:58.087
Lex likes to keep
his plans compartmentalized.

15:58.131 --> 15:59.871
Even from the love of his life?

16:00.611 --> 16:02.135
You think
I'm the love of his life?

16:02.178 --> 16:05.965
-Oh, I think you're--
-He trusted you for a reason.

16:06.356 --> 16:10.143
You were helping him experiment
on DEO prisoners.
How did he get access to them?

16:10.882 --> 16:11.971
Someone inside helped him.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.278
You're saying this was
an authorized prison transfer?

16:17.019 --> 16:19.065
-Yes.
-Who authorized it?

16:19.108 --> 16:22.503
I'm not sure.
Someone in the government.
Someone high up.

16:24.113 --> 16:26.420
What do you keep looking at?

16:31.120 --> 16:33.514
These claw marks
lead somewhere.

16:34.645 --> 16:35.472
Hey...

16:39.824 --> 16:41.783
-Dad!
-George.

16:42.566 --> 16:44.481
George!
What are you doing here?

16:44.525 --> 16:47.267
You left in the middle
of Mother's funeral.

16:47.310 --> 16:48.877
Yes, and I know. But I had to.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.574
You want me
to catch your mother's killer,
don't you?

16:50.618 --> 16:52.272
Of course I do, but you...

16:52.315 --> 16:55.231
You left me alone
in a church
full of people and...

16:56.276 --> 16:57.668
I just lost my mother.

16:58.321 --> 16:59.627
And I need you.

16:59.670 --> 17:02.543
I know,
but we need justice, son.

17:02.586 --> 17:04.240
First your grandfather,
now your mother.

17:04.893 --> 17:07.635
Everything that I am doing
is for their memories.

17:08.157 --> 17:11.117
Sir, we found something
I think you're gonna wanna see.

17:12.901 --> 17:13.989
And for you.

17:17.862 --> 17:19.516
I just don't wanna fail.

17:21.257 --> 17:22.650
Why do you think you'd fail?

17:26.523 --> 17:28.264
My mom was, uh...

17:30.005 --> 17:31.615
She was incredible with me.

17:32.703 --> 17:34.140
I mean, she always just...

17:35.141 --> 17:36.794
hugged me when I cried,
and she...

17:37.404 --> 17:39.841
fixed up
my bumps and my bruises

17:40.537 --> 17:42.844
and work on my science projects
with me.

17:42.887 --> 17:45.238
-Hmm.
-And she made me feel so loved.

17:46.674 --> 17:52.506
And, you know,
for a lot of my formative
and toughest years,

17:52.549 --> 17:54.377
she did it alone

17:55.552 --> 17:58.077
and she is the one
that inspired me to think

17:58.120 --> 18:00.557
that I can do this on my own.

18:00.992 --> 18:02.864
But now that this is...

18:02.907 --> 18:04.822
I mean,
it's right in front of me,

18:05.693 --> 18:07.390
and I'm just not sure

18:07.434 --> 18:09.436
that I can even be
half the mother
that's she's been for me.

18:10.785 --> 18:11.916
Okay, look.

18:12.961 --> 18:15.485
I've only known you
for a short time.

18:15.529 --> 18:16.921
But from what I've seen,

18:18.488 --> 18:21.056
you're the most
nurturing person
that I've ever met.

18:21.404 --> 18:22.362
Hmm.

18:22.753 --> 18:25.104
You take care of your friends,

18:25.843 --> 18:27.106
your sister,

18:28.672 --> 18:30.935
you took care of my brother
when he was in the hospital.

18:30.979 --> 18:33.677
And even me.
Who you barely knew.

18:35.723 --> 18:38.508
You care too much
to fail, Alex.

18:40.728 --> 18:44.949
I mean, you are gonna be
an amazing mother.

18:48.562 --> 18:50.738
Did anyone ever tell you
you should be a shrink?

18:51.086 --> 18:52.522
Mmm, once or twice.

18:53.784 --> 18:55.743
-All right,
give me the chocolate.
-It's all gone.

18:55.786 --> 18:57.048
-What?
-I know.

18:59.616 --> 19:00.748
What is this place?

19:14.153 --> 19:15.632
This is Harun-El.

19:22.683 --> 19:23.684
Kryptonite.

19:25.642 --> 19:27.992
This is all equipment
to hurt Kryptonians.

19:30.560 --> 19:32.997
This is a staging area.
Can't be.

19:34.477 --> 19:38.089
Looks like Lex is helping
the Kaznians to invade America.

19:38.133 --> 19:39.003
That's the plan.

19:40.440 --> 19:43.138
But a Kaznian invasion
on American soil

19:43.182 --> 19:45.401
will be like a child
throwing rocks at a tank.

19:45.445 --> 19:46.663
Lex has a tank.

19:47.664 --> 19:48.491
Tank.

19:49.449 --> 19:50.276
Tank.

19:50.885 --> 19:51.712
Tank.

19:52.278 --> 19:54.193
-Eve.
-Tank. Tank. Tank.

19:54.236 --> 19:56.456
-All right. All right,
-Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank.
Tank. Tank. Tank. Tank.

19:59.285 --> 20:02.070
Lex must have
done something to her.
Trigger word.

20:20.697 --> 20:22.046
That's Supergirl.

20:22.090 --> 20:24.266
Lexie calls her Ryzhaya Dch.

20:24.658 --> 20:26.355
That's "Red Daughter."

20:33.362 --> 20:34.972
That's pretty badass.

20:35.016 --> 20:37.061
Yeah. Wait,
but check out
the jogging strollers.

20:37.366 --> 20:39.977
You could take the baby
on a run. Look at that.

20:40.021 --> 20:42.676
Okay, that is
definitely the way to go.

20:44.721 --> 20:45.896
Oh, my gosh.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.289
Oh, my gosh.
She must be fully dilated.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.682
that means...
That means the baby's coming.

20:48.725 --> 20:50.336
That means... that--
Oh, my gosh.

20:50.379 --> 20:52.251
Hello. Yes, this is Alex, yes.

20:55.341 --> 20:56.167
What?

20:59.736 --> 21:01.260
No, I...

21:01.303 --> 21:03.697
No, I know. I know that you
said that that could happen,

21:03.740 --> 21:07.048
but you also said that
there was a very minimal chance

21:07.091 --> 21:09.050
of it happening in this case.

21:09.920 --> 21:11.095
Are you certain?

21:12.140 --> 21:12.967
Yeah.

21:14.751 --> 21:15.578
I...

21:16.884 --> 21:19.278
Yeah, I understand
what you're saying. Yeah.

21:21.541 --> 21:22.368
Okay...

21:23.630 --> 21:24.892
Okay. Thank...

21:28.809 --> 21:30.289
What happened?

21:32.378 --> 21:33.292
Um...

21:35.381 --> 21:38.340
The grandparents
called up, um,

21:38.384 --> 21:41.387
a priest to talk to the mother
and she ended up...

21:42.953 --> 21:44.346
She changed her mind

21:44.390 --> 21:45.913
and she's gonna keep...

21:46.914 --> 21:48.742
She's gonna keep the baby.

21:54.965 --> 21:56.315
Is she a clone?

21:56.967 --> 21:58.708
No. Not exactly.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.581
All these biometrics
have been affected by Harun-El.

22:01.624 --> 22:03.583
We know
it duplicates Kryptonians.

22:03.626 --> 22:05.498
It split Sam from Reign.

22:05.541 --> 22:07.978
Supergirl must have
come in contact to it.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.632
But how does Lex fit into this?

22:09.980 --> 22:13.288
Kaznians brought him in.
He's helping them control her.

22:13.593 --> 22:15.421
Supergirl would
never work with Lex.

22:15.464 --> 22:17.118
It's not Supergirl.

22:17.161 --> 22:19.642
She's a blank slate.
Or at least she was.

22:20.251 --> 22:21.470
What are you saying?

22:21.514 --> 22:23.472
It's a question
of nature versus nurture.

22:23.733 --> 22:27.520
She's been tested, trained,
and indoctrinated by Lex

22:27.563 --> 22:30.392
in a prison in one of
the most oppressive
regimes in the world.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.438
But she has to have
good in her.

22:32.481 --> 22:34.440
There was good in Sam.

22:34.483 --> 22:35.789
And Reign was a monster.

22:36.616 --> 22:38.966
Lex has created the very thing
he fears the most.

22:39.009 --> 22:41.534
Kryptonian weapon
trained as a killer.

22:41.577 --> 22:43.797
And in Lex's hands,

22:43.840 --> 22:45.929
it's more dangerous
than an atomic bomb.

22:45.973 --> 22:47.322
And he has it
pointed right at America.

22:47.366 --> 22:50.020
She is not an it.

22:51.500 --> 22:53.284
Lex may have molded her

22:53.328 --> 22:56.026
but there has to be some part
of Supergirl still in her.

22:58.202 --> 23:00.509
Red Daughter...
Is she still here?

23:01.902 --> 23:04.165
Eve. Where is she?

23:04.208 --> 23:07.560
With Lex, obviously.

23:08.822 --> 23:09.649
Eve.

23:10.867 --> 23:12.478
But the Harun-El
can't duplicate humans.

23:12.521 --> 23:13.827
He used Kopy.

23:28.798 --> 23:30.278
The two of you
shouldn't be here.

23:30.321 --> 23:32.976
But as long as you are,
stay a while.

23:35.762 --> 23:37.938
We've got ten minutes
before this building
comes crashing down.

23:37.981 --> 23:38.982
Come on.

23:43.030 --> 23:44.423
This is it.

23:44.466 --> 23:47.774
This is what
gave James Olsen powers.

23:49.558 --> 23:50.429
Sir...

23:52.561 --> 23:55.738
Everyone involved
in this project
thought the same thing.

23:55.782 --> 23:58.349
Wouldn't it be great
if humans had superpowers?

24:00.961 --> 24:04.094
James Olsen was given
a carefully calibrated
highly refined dose

24:04.138 --> 24:05.574
in the midst of
a medical emergency.

24:05.618 --> 24:07.010
Wait, wait, wait.
Hold up. Hold up.

24:08.272 --> 24:09.360
Let him finish.

24:11.058 --> 24:14.844
What you're holding
is a raw, undiluted
experimental serum

24:14.888 --> 24:16.759
that will,
in all likelihood, kill you.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.588
"In all likelihood."
That means it might not.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.112
I know the odds.

24:22.156 --> 24:23.244
They're not good.

24:25.289 --> 24:26.290
You're grieving.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.598
You wanna find
the person responsible.

24:31.121 --> 24:32.949
Your son needs you now.

24:35.474 --> 24:38.128
Sir, we found the alien
that killed your wife.

24:39.956 --> 24:41.044
Where?

24:44.918 --> 24:46.441
Get our agents
over there right now.

24:46.485 --> 24:47.964
They're all out searching.

24:48.008 --> 24:49.923
Then assemble
a DEO strike team.

24:49.966 --> 24:51.272
I'll lead.

24:52.316 --> 24:53.143
Go!

25:08.985 --> 25:10.160
-I'll go right.
-I'll go left.

25:26.612 --> 25:28.048
Oh, my God.

25:35.838 --> 25:36.839
Damn it.

25:53.769 --> 25:54.596
Kara?

25:56.032 --> 25:57.599
No. No.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.343
Hey, there's no way out
back this way.
Is there--

26:02.386 --> 26:03.474
No, no, um...

26:04.127 --> 26:05.825
There's... there's just...

26:05.868 --> 26:07.391
Hey, it's okay.
There's nothing
to be afraid of, right?

26:07.435 --> 26:10.525
We've been through
worse scrapes than this
together, okay?

26:10.569 --> 26:13.006
-Right. So--
-Wait, wait, Lena...

26:13.049 --> 26:14.007
There...

26:14.877 --> 26:16.357
We can go up.

26:17.314 --> 26:18.881
The air vent. Yeah.

26:26.323 --> 26:27.890
Kara, your turn.

26:29.022 --> 26:30.545
I, uh...

26:30.589 --> 26:33.026
I forgot my tape recorder.

26:34.157 --> 26:35.245
Kara?

26:51.653 --> 26:53.220
Kara, come on!

26:59.530 --> 27:00.619
Freeze! Don't move!

27:06.755 --> 27:09.279
Where's the Brevakk
who killed my wife?

27:09.932 --> 27:11.586
- That's her!
- I got her.

27:16.939 --> 27:18.462
Take her out of here.

27:24.817 --> 27:29.038
And rendition the lot of them
for enhanced interrogation.

27:29.996 --> 27:31.780
Mr. Secretary,

27:32.085 --> 27:33.913
we found
who we were looking for.

27:35.088 --> 27:37.264
The rest of these aliens
are innocent of any crimes.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.570
They were harboring a murderer.

27:40.746 --> 27:42.312
Move.

27:53.149 --> 27:56.065
Well, thank God
for Eve's paper fetish.

27:57.806 --> 27:58.720
Thanks.

28:04.334 --> 28:05.988
The DEO prisoner transfers.

28:08.817 --> 28:11.254
Signed and authorized
by Sarah Walker.

28:11.298 --> 28:12.952
The President's Chief of Staff?

28:12.995 --> 28:15.519
She is the mole
in the government.
She's working with Lex.

28:17.696 --> 28:19.785
It's Eve. I'll get her,
you get the evidence.

28:19.828 --> 28:21.264
No, Lena, wait.

28:27.618 --> 28:28.968
Secretary Lockwood.

28:32.406 --> 28:35.278
The hero
and the blood traitor.

28:35.322 --> 28:37.237
I was hoping you would come by.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.629
Arrest them.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.156
Oh, good. You found my plane.

28:44.026 --> 28:45.288
I hoped
it wouldn't come to this.

28:45.332 --> 28:46.376
Really?

28:52.469 --> 28:54.210
-'Cause I did.

28:56.560 --> 28:57.910
This is a surprise.

29:15.275 --> 29:17.190
Arrest them!

29:17.233 --> 29:20.715
No! Each one of us
swore an oath

29:20.759 --> 29:24.501
to defend this country
and its constitution.

29:25.372 --> 29:28.897
The Secretary is asking you
to compromise that oath.

29:28.941 --> 29:31.595
I urge you. Follow your hearts.

29:32.901 --> 29:34.207
Not your orders.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.537
Thank you. Next.

30:16.510 --> 30:17.511
My turn.

30:25.127 --> 30:26.868
Lex was only using you,
you know.

30:26.912 --> 30:28.087
Lex loves me.

30:28.130 --> 30:29.915
The only person Lex loves
is himself.

30:32.961 --> 30:34.484
Everybody, get down.

31:14.350 --> 31:15.525
Kara!

31:19.834 --> 31:20.661
Earth first.

31:24.404 --> 31:26.928
Stand down or suffer.

31:28.799 --> 31:30.410
I wish
you didn't make me do that.

31:36.285 --> 31:37.373
Thank you, Kara.

31:39.071 --> 31:40.681
Snake on a plane.

31:44.293 --> 31:47.340
You think you have
the weight of the world's pain
on your shoulders.

31:47.383 --> 31:48.384
But you don't.

31:48.428 --> 31:50.909
You created this pain,
this fear.

31:51.605 --> 31:54.608
You know
nothing about me, alien.

31:54.651 --> 31:56.305
I am the Martian Manhunter.

31:56.349 --> 31:59.047
I know you
and you should know this...

31:59.918 --> 32:02.007
The last man
who stood against me

32:02.050 --> 32:04.226
met a downfall
all of his own making.

32:04.270 --> 32:07.882
There will be no downfall.
I am the law.

32:07.926 --> 32:09.275
For now.

32:09.318 --> 32:10.841
But regimes change.

32:16.717 --> 32:17.544
The tanker.

32:19.372 --> 32:20.286
Trust me.

32:30.252 --> 32:31.993
Let's get these aliens
somewhere safe.

32:35.736 --> 32:36.563
Kara!

32:38.173 --> 32:39.131
Kara.

32:39.435 --> 32:41.133
I'm okay. Everything's fine.

32:41.481 --> 32:42.612
Oh, God.
Come here.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.353
Oh, God.
Thank God you're all right.

32:44.397 --> 32:46.312
-Did you find Tessmacher?
-Yeah.

32:53.580 --> 32:55.190
It wasn't the real Tessmacher.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.497
Maybe it never was.

32:59.238 --> 33:00.543
But it's okay.

33:00.979 --> 33:03.546
Now we know
what Lex has been up to

33:03.590 --> 33:04.895
and who was helping him.

33:06.810 --> 33:08.464
Now we know everything.

33:32.140 --> 33:34.055
I'm so sorry
I left you alone back there.

33:34.490 --> 33:35.448
Put you in danger.

33:35.491 --> 33:38.146
I was fine.
I am fine.

33:38.668 --> 33:41.410
When I saw Eve,
I just saw red.

33:42.150 --> 33:44.283
Shot me right back to
the initial betrayal.

33:44.326 --> 33:46.328
I... wasn't thinking clearly.

33:46.372 --> 33:50.376
You don't have to explain
anything to me.
I know how much she hurt you.

33:50.419 --> 33:52.726
Kara! Please!
I'm trying to apologize to you.

33:52.769 --> 33:54.162
That explosion
could have killed you.

33:55.685 --> 33:57.513
It... it wouldn't have.

34:03.432 --> 34:04.651
Lena--

34:04.694 --> 34:08.089
I don't let my guard down ever.

34:08.133 --> 34:11.049
And I did with Eve
and she betrayed me.

34:12.180 --> 34:15.662
I let her in
and she lied to me.

34:16.532 --> 34:19.231
Every day. To my face.

34:19.274 --> 34:20.536
About who she was.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.236
And that's what hurts.

34:25.367 --> 34:29.110
I don't...
I don't know if I'll
ever recover from it,

34:31.591 --> 34:33.071
but I know there is

34:33.897 --> 34:36.204
no way I could ever
trust anyone ever again

34:36.248 --> 34:37.292
if it wasn't

34:38.511 --> 34:41.079
for your friendship
and your integrity.

34:43.385 --> 34:45.909
It just...
It means the world to me, Kara.

34:48.564 --> 34:50.349
I'm always
gonna be here for you.

34:53.874 --> 34:56.006
When I left my fiancee,
I, uh...

34:57.399 --> 34:58.792
It's hard to even say that.

35:00.576 --> 35:04.145
I felt like
I would never heal.

35:06.539 --> 35:07.366
But then I did.

35:09.107 --> 35:10.369
And then, this...

35:11.761 --> 35:14.242
whole experience just

35:15.939 --> 35:19.160
feels like that wound
just got ripped
right back open again.

35:19.943 --> 35:21.031
And this time, I don't...

35:23.077 --> 35:24.513
I don't know
if I can survive that.

35:25.601 --> 35:27.386
-Wounds heal.
-Into scars.

35:27.429 --> 35:28.691
That fade in time.

35:32.478 --> 35:35.872
Some people
leave indelible marks

35:36.917 --> 35:38.745
and you get to wear them
like a badge of honor

35:39.702 --> 35:41.617
of what you learn
from the experience.

35:42.052 --> 35:43.793
Yeah?
What did your scars teach you?

35:44.446 --> 35:46.100
That there are
always second chances.

35:47.928 --> 35:50.887
-If you're brave enough
to take the leap.
-It's easier said than done.

35:52.585 --> 35:54.021
I was engaged.

35:56.545 --> 35:57.633
James never mentioned that.

35:57.981 --> 35:59.157
Yeah, well, he didn't know.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.290
No one did.

36:05.163 --> 36:07.600
Because I was in love
with my sergeant.

36:10.298 --> 36:12.822
And we couldn't be out
while serving abroad.

36:16.348 --> 36:17.523
What happened?

36:19.046 --> 36:21.266
She died while on patrol.

36:23.746 --> 36:25.095
And I couldn't mourn her.

36:25.705 --> 36:27.141
I was just numb.

36:29.099 --> 36:31.014
Alone in my pain.

36:33.278 --> 36:34.409
And, I, um...

36:36.194 --> 36:40.154
I didn't face it
until I was back Stateside
a few months later.

36:43.853 --> 36:46.073
I thought that wound
would never heal.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.947
And then
I got her farewell note.

36:53.080 --> 36:56.475
Service members send them
sometimes before tours of duty

36:58.216 --> 37:00.043
in case
they don't come back home.

37:02.959 --> 37:05.048
I never thought
that I'd have to read hers.

37:08.530 --> 37:12.317
She said
that she had every faith

37:12.360 --> 37:15.233
that I would find
another person
who would make me smile.

37:16.321 --> 37:17.539
And so will you.

37:18.758 --> 37:21.239
You will get a second chance
at everything.

37:22.370 --> 37:23.980
Don't lose hope.

37:24.720 --> 37:29.595
Today, this is absolutely
a deep wound.

37:32.032 --> 37:33.163
But someday,

37:34.948 --> 37:36.863
it'll be a faded scar.

37:50.050 --> 37:51.834
-Son...
-Don't.

37:52.835 --> 37:55.316
I came to you
and you turned away from me.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.927
You have to understand, son.
I had to find--

37:57.971 --> 38:00.278
Mom's killer. Right?

38:01.104 --> 38:02.236
Did it help?

38:02.497 --> 38:04.543
You know,
I saw you today.

38:05.979 --> 38:09.156
Just another bitter, angry man.

38:09.504 --> 38:12.899
George? George.
I did this all to keep
you and your mother safe.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.118
You did this
for yourself.

38:16.381 --> 38:18.687
You're responsible
for her death.

38:18.731 --> 38:21.081
You killed her with this
stupid fight of yours

38:21.124 --> 38:23.213
and I will never forgive you.

38:25.564 --> 38:26.608
I hate you.

39:01.643 --> 39:03.341
-Red Daughter?
-Yup.

39:04.733 --> 39:06.735
I know
I should be afraid of her,

39:06.779 --> 39:08.476
but I kind of
feel bad for her.

39:09.347 --> 39:13.307
I mean, if I had landed
anywhere else,
that could have been me.

39:13.351 --> 39:15.831
A refugee raised as a weapon.

39:16.441 --> 39:18.965
But if Lena had found out
in that moment
who you really are...

39:19.008 --> 39:20.227
I almost told her myself.

39:22.403 --> 39:23.709
Lex already knows.

39:24.013 --> 39:25.928
What stopped you
from telling Lena?

39:26.276 --> 39:29.628
The past few months,
she's been betrayed
by Lex, by Eve...

39:30.672 --> 39:34.459
So, if she found out
after all this time
I was lying...

39:36.591 --> 39:39.028
I couldn't bear
to put her through that again.

39:40.856 --> 39:43.468
But, when this is all over,
and Lex is behind bars,

39:43.511 --> 39:46.166
I am going to
tell her the truth.

39:46.209 --> 39:47.689
Even if she hates me.

39:48.951 --> 39:51.998
I have to.
It's the right thing to do.

39:53.260 --> 39:55.218
It is. I think you're right.

39:57.699 --> 40:00.702
And what are you gonna do
about what you found
on that map?

40:02.138 --> 40:04.358
My duty as an American citizen.

40:13.411 --> 40:14.673
Mr. President.

40:14.716 --> 40:16.849
-Ah.
-Thank you for seeing me.

40:16.892 --> 40:18.459
Welcome. Welcome.

40:19.765 --> 40:22.811
I have nothing but respect
for Cat Grant's media empire.

40:23.551 --> 40:27.512
-And nothing but fear
of her wrath.

40:28.382 --> 40:29.557
Is that Kryptonite?

40:30.689 --> 40:33.039
Ah. Sharp eye, young lady.

40:33.082 --> 40:35.607
Ever since Supergirl
attacked the White House

40:35.650 --> 40:38.000
we've added
some necessary precautions

40:38.044 --> 40:40.568
to, uh, keep me safe.

40:41.613 --> 40:42.657
So, where do we start?

40:43.266 --> 40:45.747
The United States
is in danger, sir.

40:46.356 --> 40:48.010
I came here to warn you.

40:48.489 --> 40:49.447
Warn me?

40:50.317 --> 40:51.318
Of what?

41:00.370 --> 41:05.724
Lex Luthor has allied
with the Kaznian government
and they are going to attack.

41:05.767 --> 41:07.856
And Supergirl
didn't attack you.

41:07.900 --> 41:11.077
A clone
that worked for Lex did.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.950
And your Chief of Staff
is in collusion with him.

41:18.127 --> 41:20.129
Do you...
do you have any proof?

41:27.441 --> 41:30.009
I wanna thank you
for bringing this
to my attention.

41:34.535 --> 41:36.319
Now, Miss Danvers, uh...

41:36.363 --> 41:38.670
Has anyone else
seen this evidence?

41:38.713 --> 41:40.280
No, I... I thought

41:40.323 --> 41:42.761
it was more important
to warn you
as soon as possible.

41:45.677 --> 41:47.896
You did the right thing.
