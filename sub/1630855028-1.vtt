[narrator] <i>Four years ago,
Nick and Audrey Spitz</i>

00:39.041 --> 00:42.375
<i>solved some of the most
high-profile murders of the century.</i>

00:42.875 --> 00:43.958
- [music continues]
- [gasps]

00:46.500 --> 00:47.791
[Audrey] Oh my God! Oh my God!

00:48.708 --> 00:50.875
- Should we pull it out?
- No, it's a foot-long knife.

00:50.875 --> 00:52.416
- [all screaming]
- I'll put it back in.

00:52.416 --> 00:54.875
- Don't put it back.
- [all moaning and yelling]

00:54.875 --> 00:57.083
[narrator]
<i>Like many overnight success stories,</i>

00:57.083 --> 00:59.666
<i>Nick and Audrey
immediately quit their jobs</i>

00:59.666 --> 01:01.416
<i>and poured their life savings</i>

01:01.416 --> 01:04.375
<i>into pursuing a career
as private investigators.</i>

01:04.375 --> 01:05.708
- [loud crunching]
- [Audrey] Hmm.

01:06.458 --> 01:07.416
Uh...

01:07.416 --> 01:09.041
- Yeah.
- Would you excuse me?

01:09.041 --> 01:10.708
Mm. Yes, not a problem.

01:10.708 --> 01:12.166
[crunching continues]

01:12.166 --> 01:14.458
Are you kidding me right now
with those potato chips?

01:14.458 --> 01:18.041
Are you seriously yelling at me?
I watched you eat two shrimp cocktails.

01:18.041 --> 01:20.625
Stop distracting me. Okay?

01:20.625 --> 01:23.000
[narrator] <i>Unfortunately,
it's not going very well.</i>

01:23.000 --> 01:26.583
Men get to a certain stage in their life.
It's nothing to do with you.

01:26.583 --> 01:28.083
Not all men.

01:28.083 --> 01:30.208
- No, but--
- Don't get mad at <i>me</i> for this.

01:30.208 --> 01:33.125
- [door closes]
- [woman] You've been cheating on me, Ron.

01:33.125 --> 01:36.000
- Really? After 25 years?
- [sighs]

01:36.000 --> 01:37.125
[Ron] Baby...

01:37.125 --> 01:40.666
I've been going out on my own so I could
plan a surprise wedding anniversary.

01:40.666 --> 01:42.333
- No, that's so sweet!
- That's...

01:42.333 --> 01:44.916
- [Ron] Come on. I love you.
- I'm so sorry.

01:44.916 --> 01:46.666
Excuse us, you guys.

01:46.666 --> 01:48.791
If you don't mind just paying this bill,

01:48.791 --> 01:50.916
we'll be out of your lovebuggin' hair.

01:50.916 --> 01:52.875
- A bill? You're billing her?
- Yeah, no.

01:52.875 --> 01:53.958
We made a deal--

01:53.958 --> 01:55.083
You were hitting on me!

01:55.083 --> 01:56.416
- I was undercover.
- <i>Pretend--</i>

01:56.416 --> 01:57.958

[narrator] <i>With business struggling,
Nick and Audrey</i>

02:00.166 --> 02:01.541

02:01.541 --> 02:02.541
You better run!

02:02.541 --> 02:04.375
<i>...that someone close to them</i>

02:04.375 --> 02:05.625
<i>would be killed.</i>

02:11.458 --> 02:14.875
[soft high-pitched sounds echoing]

02:14.875 --> 02:18.000
[low snorting, moaning]

02:18.000 --> 02:19.500
Oh God!

02:20.583 --> 02:21.666
Honey, honey, honey. Hey!

02:22.250 --> 02:24.291
Can't you put on beach waves
or something nice?

02:24.291 --> 02:26.833
[Nick] The whale noises
help me fall asleep.

02:26.833 --> 02:29.208
- You took away my Ambien, so...
- [Audrey] You know why?

02:29.208 --> 02:31.166
Remember the last time you took Ambien?

02:31.166 --> 02:33.166
You went sleepwalking into the lobby

02:33.166 --> 02:36.166
wearing my underwear, and then
you started watering the couch.

02:36.166 --> 02:37.791
I don't remember doing that.

02:37.791 --> 02:40.041
Look. Doorman took a picture.
It's my screen saver.

02:41.125 --> 02:43.291
- Uh, that's somebody else.
- [Audrey] Okay.

02:43.291 --> 02:47.541
Listen, baby, if you can't sleep, um,

02:48.458 --> 02:49.916
we could try to, uh,

02:50.625 --> 02:52.875
knock out a chapter together.

02:52.875 --> 02:54.083
[Nick] I read a few pages.

02:54.083 --> 02:56.208
That guy doesn't know
what he's talking about.

02:56.208 --> 02:58.500
[Audrey] Honey, this is the guy
that wrote the test.

02:58.500 --> 03:00.583
The test you need to take to get licensed.

03:00.583 --> 03:01.666
[Nick] I was a real cop.

03:01.666 --> 03:04.291
I don't need some piece of paper
telling me I know what I'm doing.

03:04.291 --> 03:05.375
I know what I'm doing!

03:05.375 --> 03:08.083
But we both agreed
that it would help our business

03:08.083 --> 03:10.208
if we just, you know, took the course.

03:10.208 --> 03:12.958
Do you really think our business
is struggling because of that?

03:12.958 --> 03:16.000
I think we would get better clientele
if both of us were licensed.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.625
Only way to get better clientele
is better marketing.

03:18.625 --> 03:21.333
Better marketing?
Like your floss business cards?

03:21.333 --> 03:23.583
- Yes.
- [Audrey] Seriously? God!

03:23.583 --> 03:25.625
It's called "disruptive marketing."

03:25.625 --> 03:28.875
It's not disruptive. It's confusing.
We're not dentists. We're--

03:28.875 --> 03:30.000
[whale noises start up]

03:30.000 --> 03:31.958
I can talk louder than the sound machine.

03:31.958 --> 03:33.791
- [volume increasing]
- [Audrey] Honey, come on!

03:33.791 --> 03:35.041
[Nick] Fine. Forget it.

03:36.041 --> 03:37.541
Do you not wanna do this anymore?

03:38.125 --> 03:40.083
I do. I wanna do this. It's just...

03:40.083 --> 03:42.458
It's all we ever do is talk about work.

03:43.083 --> 03:46.875
Do you know any couples who also
work together that actually get along?

03:47.458 --> 03:49.541
Billie Eilish and Finneas.

03:49.541 --> 03:50.666
They're brother and sister.

03:50.666 --> 03:54.541
Look, baby, I know this isn't
what we pictured when we got into this--

03:54.541 --> 03:56.375
[cell phone playing Indian hip-hop music]

03:56.375 --> 03:58.000
What the hell is that?

03:58.000 --> 03:59.583
Uh, it's my phone.

03:59.583 --> 04:02.666
[phone continues ringing and vibrating]

04:02.666 --> 04:06.083
Yo! Rajah! Namaste. What's up, my brother?

04:06.083 --> 04:09.041
[Maharajah]
<i>Yo! What are you doing, Nicky Nick?</i>

04:09.041 --> 04:11.916
Are you mowing your lawn or something?
What do I hear right now?

04:11.916 --> 04:15.500
Yo, I'm chillin' on a Jet Ski, dog!
[laughs]

04:15.500 --> 04:18.083
On a Jet Ski and on the phone
at the same time?

04:18.083 --> 04:20.500
[Maharajah] Yo, Nick.
Broski. My brosephus.

04:20.500 --> 04:23.541
The Maharajah is getting married!

04:24.125 --> 04:26.541
Oh, that's incredible!

04:26.541 --> 04:28.666
Let me tell Audrey. Audrey!

04:28.666 --> 04:29.875
He's getting married.

04:29.875 --> 04:31.250
- What?
- [Nick] Oh yeah.

04:31.750 --> 04:35.583
Vik! Congratulations!
We're so happy for you!

04:35.583 --> 04:38.958
Thank you! She's a dime piece from Paris.

04:38.958 --> 04:41.541
You know,
where the Eiffel Tower is and shit.

<i>I need to see you two ballers
out on the dance floor busting a nut!</i>

"Busting a move," you mean.

Oh shit!

- What's happening?

04:59.750 --> 05:01.666
Did you hear "all-expenses-paid"?

05:01.666 --> 05:05.708
- We have to work this weekend.
- I gotta say, I could use a getaway.

05:05.708 --> 05:08.458
Remember what happened
last time we went on a getaway?

05:08.458 --> 05:10.375
Yeah, some people died.

05:10.375 --> 05:11.916
Not s-- A <i>lot</i> of people.

05:11.916 --> 05:13.666
You think five people dying's a lot?

05:13.666 --> 05:16.416
All right. Hold on.
Just gonna think for a second.

05:16.416 --> 05:18.125
- She's caving in.
- Okay, so...

05:18.625 --> 05:20.333
- She's caving in.
- Just wait.

05:20.333 --> 05:21.666
No. Go ahead.

05:21.666 --> 05:23.291
Okay, I do agree.

05:23.875 --> 05:26.291
I think we could both use
a little bit of a break.

05:26.291 --> 05:27.666
- A break?
- From all this.

05:27.666 --> 05:30.291
- Just no work for a minute, you know?
- Not--

05:30.291 --> 05:32.250
- It's--
- No. For at least a weekend.

05:32.250 --> 05:35.041
The whole weekend.
We can... Let's not... Let's just...

05:35.041 --> 05:36.750
Our minds need the no work.

05:36.750 --> 05:38.583
- I can't talk--
- I got chills! Goosebumps!

05:38.583 --> 05:40.291
'Cause we're gonna do this, aren't we?

05:40.291 --> 05:43.166
[dynamic music playing]

05:44.833 --> 05:47.833
- Wow. How about that. Mm-hmm.
- Such a good decision.

05:47.833 --> 05:50.250
You like the view, Mr. and Mrs. Shitz?

05:50.250 --> 05:53.000
Oh. You know what?
Excuse me. I'm so sorry. It's...

05:53.000 --> 05:55.875
We're Nick and Audrey Spitz. It's, um...

05:55.875 --> 05:58.250
But, yes, it's a gorgeous view.

05:58.250 --> 06:01.125
Would you like some music,
Mr. and Mrs. Shitz?

06:01.125 --> 06:04.625
We're the Spitzes not the Shitzes. Okay?

06:04.625 --> 06:08.250
Yes, I have some Pitbull
or, uh, Taylor Shitz.

06:08.250 --> 06:12.208
- Okay. He's sticking with the Shitz.
- Puts "Shitz" at the end of everything.

06:12.208 --> 06:13.541
Where are you from?

06:13.541 --> 06:16.583
I'm, uh, from the, uh... European!

Mademoiselle Claudette Joubert.

07:15.125 --> 07:18.250

It is such a pleasure to meet you.

07:18.250 --> 07:20.500
You are more beautiful
than Vikram described.

07:20.500 --> 07:23.208

07:23.208 --> 07:25.250
- That's funny. Got 'em all.
- Oh!

07:25.750 --> 07:27.166
Four? I thought it was two.

07:27.166 --> 07:28.416
And Nick.

07:28.416 --> 07:31.000
- I've been wanting to meet you.
- All right!

07:31.000 --> 07:32.500
Congratulations.

07:34.041 --> 07:38.083
Thank you. I appreciate that.
Yeah. I love it.

07:38.083 --> 07:40.458
- Okay! All right, stop!
- [Nick] What happened?

07:40.458 --> 07:42.208
[Audrey] Cut it out!

07:42.208 --> 07:43.291
[Claudette] Please, come.

07:43.291 --> 07:46.083
[Audrey] I have to tell you,
Paris is my favorite city in the world.

07:46.083 --> 07:49.833
- When was the last time you were there?
- Hmm. Oh, I've actually not been there.

07:49.833 --> 07:53.083
But I just know from the movies
and from the pictures and--

07:53.083 --> 07:56.291
[Nick] Hey, thanks for the wedding invite.
So happy you could squeeze us in.

07:56.291 --> 07:57.916
- [Vik] No, for sure, man!
- Unbelievable!

07:57.916 --> 07:59.791
We had extra seats 'cause my parents died.

07:59.791 --> 08:01.583
- Ooh! I'm--
- Oh! I'm so sorry.

08:01.583 --> 08:02.708
[Nick] That's terrible.

08:02.708 --> 08:04.958
[laughs] No! I'm just kidding!

08:04.958 --> 08:07.208
Oh, okay. So, they're coming?

08:07.208 --> 08:10.416
Uh, no, they died,
but they were never gonna come.

08:11.208 --> 08:12.250
'Cause I hated them.

08:12.250 --> 08:14.833
- There you go. All right. That's--
- Okay.

08:14.833 --> 08:17.791
Oh. Colonel, you know the Spitzes.

08:17.791 --> 08:19.333
- What?
- Colonel!

08:19.333 --> 08:20.625
My friends!

08:20.625 --> 08:22.875
- My God!
- Oh my God. What happened to your arm?

08:23.541 --> 08:25.166
Is it that noticeable?

08:25.166 --> 08:29.000
Last time we saw you,
you had a lot more of... of your arm.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.583
Well, if I had to lose one,
that would be the one to lose

08:32.583 --> 08:34.750
because it's already missing a hand.

08:34.750 --> 08:37.541
You don't have to share the armrest now
at the movie theater.

08:37.541 --> 08:40.458
- [all chuckle]
- Yo, yo, yo. But real talk.

08:40.458 --> 08:43.625
The Colonel stopped a bullet
meant for me in Mumbai.

08:43.625 --> 08:45.583
- You kidding?
- Somebody tried to shoot you?

08:45.583 --> 08:48.583
Yeah. Some people don't like
the way my company does business.

08:48.583 --> 08:52.541
Sadly, the Colonel's injury stops him
from protecting me to the fullest,

08:52.541 --> 08:54.541
so I had to get me a new head bodyguard.

08:54.541 --> 08:55.875
Mr. Louis!

08:55.875 --> 08:58.125
- Check it out, right?
- [Audrey] Hello, Louis!

08:58.125 --> 09:00.083
And, yo, my man is fully armed.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.000
[Nick] He's <i>fully</i> armed. That's funny!

09:02.000 --> 09:04.625
Okay. I hope
you don't find anything in there.

09:04.625 --> 09:06.666
- I hope not!
- [all laugh]

09:06.666 --> 09:07.750
I hate to say it.

09:07.750 --> 09:11.083
If you and the Colonel are ever caught
in a fight, my money's on the Colonel.

09:11.083 --> 09:14.416
He'd open a can of whoop ass
with his, uh... with his good arm.

09:14.416 --> 09:16.625
No? You didn't like that one?
I was joking around.

09:16.625 --> 09:17.958
- Nice to meet you.
- Let's go.

09:17.958 --> 09:18.875
Follow me.

09:18.875 --> 09:19.958
[Nick] Coming. Coming.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.083
[Nick] Sounds great!

09:26.083 --> 09:29.000
[Claudette] I'm assuming you've never been
to an Indian wedding before.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.625
- [laughing] Why would you assume that?
- Oh, so you have?

09:31.625 --> 09:32.750
Uh, no.

09:32.750 --> 09:37.000
So tonight is the <i>Sangeet.</i>
It's like a rehearsal dinner.

09:37.000 --> 09:41.625
And then we have, um, a very dramatic
surprise entrance plan

09:41.625 --> 09:43.750
that I think you'll find
quite entertaining.

09:43.750 --> 09:45.666
- [phone rings]
- [Claudette] I need to take this.

09:45.666 --> 09:48.708
Your villa should have everything
you need. Make yourselves at home.

09:50.166 --> 09:51.250
- And we--
- Bye! Enjoy!

09:51.250 --> 09:53.083
- Bye. Thank you.
- No more kisses. Cool.

[sighs] She was working in a watch shop
off La Place Vendôme when I met her.

09:56.958 --> 09:58.083
Not a penny to her name.

09:58.083 --> 10:00.125
Love at first sight, you know what I mean?

10:00.125 --> 10:02.000
She just fills me with like... [grunts]

10:02.000 --> 10:03.666
- With happiness.
- [Nick] That's nice.

10:03.666 --> 10:05.500
I see that same happiness in you two

10:05.500 --> 10:07.000
when you look at each other.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.875
You guys are happy, right?

10:09.875 --> 10:12.250
- Us? Are you kidding?
- Without her, I would not be happy.

10:12.250 --> 10:15.083
- With her, I'm the happiest.
- Not a day goes by where I just wanna go...

10:15.083 --> 10:16.666
[grunts] I love you so much.

10:16.666 --> 10:19.500
She makes every decision for us,
and I'm fine with that.

10:19.500 --> 10:22.500
- Now get in there and have fun, all right?
- [Nick] Thank you so much.

10:22.500 --> 10:24.541
- [Vik] Enjoy yourself.
- Okay. Oh, so we...

10:24.541 --> 10:26.541

- Oh, flip-flops!

Flip-flops,

What do you mean
all communication systems are down?

20:07.083 --> 20:08.875
Get them up and running!

20:08.875 --> 20:12.666
We have a security officer compromised.
We need medical attention immediately.

20:12.666 --> 20:13.708
[sighs] Okay.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.500
[Vik] Help!

20:15.500 --> 20:18.125
Yo, you hatin’ hard on me right now, son!

20:18.125 --> 20:20.166
- Homeboy!
- [Vik] Nick!

20:23.875 --> 20:25.291
[boat engine revs]

20:25.291 --> 20:27.250
[Vik yelling] Nick!

20:27.250 --> 20:29.791
This is some janky-ass shit!

20:31.250 --> 20:33.000
[Colonel] Lock down the island

20:33.000 --> 20:35.666
until the security cameras
are back online.

20:36.166 --> 20:38.250
All guests are to remain in their rooms.

20:38.250 --> 20:41.916
Oh my God. We need to get ahead of this,
or our shares will plummet.

20:41.916 --> 20:43.166
My brother could be dead

20:43.166 --> 20:45.666
and the only thing you're concerned about
are share prices?

20:45.666 --> 20:47.791
Oh! [laughs]

20:47.791 --> 20:51.083
How do you think our investors will react
when news of this gets out,

20:51.083 --> 20:53.708
you little Miss Minority Shareholder?

20:53.708 --> 20:56.708
Giving all her money
to save the whales and heal the planet

20:56.708 --> 20:58.125
and all that nonsense.

20:58.833 --> 21:01.125
Colonel. Where is Vik?

21:01.958 --> 21:03.208
Where is my husband?

21:03.208 --> 21:05.708
[Colonel] We will find him.
We will find him.

21:05.708 --> 21:07.583
[panting]

21:07.583 --> 21:09.416
The Maharajah's been kidnapped.

21:09.416 --> 21:10.833
- What?
- [Countess] Oh my God!

21:10.833 --> 21:12.791
- Where did they take him?
- [Nick] He's alive.

21:12.791 --> 21:16.125
Somebody with a machine gun
threw him on a boat, and they took off.

21:16.125 --> 21:17.541
- How many kidnappers?
- [Nick] One.

21:17.541 --> 21:20.000
Which means his partner
is still here on the island.

21:20.000 --> 21:22.458
Hold on. How do you know there were two?

21:22.458 --> 21:25.583
If the kidnapper had Vik
and was taking him to the boat...

21:25.583 --> 21:28.458
Ah, someone else
was leading the elephant into the tent.

21:28.458 --> 21:31.166
- Thank you.
- There are 400 people on this island.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.416
That's a lot of suspects.

21:32.416 --> 21:34.666
Let us narrow it down for you,
okay, Colonel?

21:34.666 --> 21:38.250
Claudette, how many people knew about
the elephant being part of the ceremony?

21:38.250 --> 21:39.166
Just the board.

21:39.166 --> 21:42.375
Yeah, we had to sign off at the expense
of transporting an elephant.

21:42.375 --> 21:44.375
So that means all of you.

21:44.375 --> 21:45.958
What are you implying?

21:45.958 --> 21:48.916
I think it's very obvious
what I'm implying.

21:48.916 --> 21:51.541
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.
- One of you is an accomplice to a murder.

21:52.041 --> 21:54.500
[mysterious music playing]

21:54.500 --> 21:56.208
- That is ridiculous!
- I'm not on the board!

21:56.208 --> 21:59.000
Is it? You all hated my brother!

21:59.000 --> 22:01.208
What? No, I... I love Vik.

22:01.208 --> 22:03.041
[scoffs] Oh, please!

22:03.041 --> 22:05.541
- You've never forgiven me.
- For what?

22:05.541 --> 22:08.250
- Breaking up your engagement.
- Oh, get over yourself.

22:08.250 --> 22:11.708
It was an arranged marriage
between our families.

22:11.708 --> 22:16.041
We amicably split in order to allow
for your so-called "love marriage."

22:16.041 --> 22:18.791
You didn't want this marriage
to go through so you kidnapped him!

22:18.791 --> 22:20.083
You gold-digging--

22:20.083 --> 22:24.333
- Ladies, stop it!
- Calm down, everybody!

22:24.333 --> 22:27.041
- We do this for a living. It's what we do.
- [Nick] It's our thing.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.875
- And this is not just another case.
- No.

22:28.875 --> 22:31.000
- [Nick] This is personal.
- [Audrey] Yeah, it's Vik.

22:31.000 --> 22:34.208
- [Nick] He means a lot to us.
- [Audrey] So we'll find out who did this.

22:34.208 --> 22:37.458
- [Nick] A hundred percent.
- [Audrey] And find out why they did this.

22:37.458 --> 22:39.041
And we're gonna get Vik back, okay?

22:39.041 --> 22:42.625
We're gonna do this
for the low, low price of $25 million.

22:42.625 --> 22:44.791
[silence]

22:46.041 --> 22:48.458
Twenty-five mil, honey. I swear to God.

22:48.458 --> 22:50.166
[Nick] I would've settled for ten grand.

22:50.166 --> 22:51.666
So insane.

22:53.250 --> 22:54.291
[Nick grunts]

22:54.291 --> 22:56.125
What are you doing?

22:56.125 --> 22:58.458
[Nick] I'm blocking the door
so no one can get in.

22:58.458 --> 23:00.250
[Audrey]
Honey, you're gonna hurt your back.

23:00.250 --> 23:03.166
You know what would hurt my back?
A knife going through it.

23:03.166 --> 23:04.666
The killer knows we're on to him.

23:04.666 --> 23:06.750
We're on the next-to-kill list.
I guarantee it.

23:06.750 --> 23:07.708
What happened to Vik?

23:07.708 --> 23:10.166
A guy that rich
gets kidnapped for the money.

23:10.166 --> 23:11.791
There's no profit in hurting him.

23:11.791 --> 23:15.083
Oh God. We're not gonna be invited
anywhere ever again. Ever again.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.500
The cheese has a hold on me, honey.
I can't stop.

23:17.500 --> 23:20.708
Are you just... Will you take a slice
like a civilized person?

23:20.708 --> 23:22.166
I don't know where the knife is.

23:22.166 --> 23:24.666
- Oh Jesus!
- [Nick] What? You got a headache?

23:24.666 --> 23:26.000
- Yes!
- [Nick] I'm sorry.

23:26.000 --> 23:27.875
- How's your back?
- My back's killing me.

23:27.875 --> 23:29.333
- I'll get Advil.
- Please. Please.

23:29.333 --> 23:32.708
- I'm gonna get more cheese in me.
- Honey, do not eat all that cheese.

23:32.708 --> 23:34.791
That affects... You're terrible all night.

23:34.791 --> 23:36.208
- Absolutely.
- Oh.

23:36.208 --> 23:39.833
And I have pictures from the tent
of a burned robe with bloodstains.

23:39.833 --> 23:41.666
Someone was trying
to get rid of the evidence,

23:41.666 --> 23:43.875
and I'm sure it was the elephant handler.

23:43.875 --> 23:45.208
Good detecting, sweetheart.

23:45.208 --> 23:47.208
- I'm doing my best. Here.
- [Nick] Okay. Thank you.

23:47.208 --> 23:49.250
- [Audrey] One, two, three, four.
- [Nick] Okay.

23:50.166 --> 23:52.500
- [frantic knocking on door]
- [dramatic music playing]

23:52.500 --> 23:54.041
[Nick] I gotta move this stuff now?

23:54.041 --> 23:55.333
What if that's the killer?

23:55.333 --> 23:57.666
- Killers don't knock.
- What if it's housekeeping?

23:57.666 --> 24:00.375
We... We're good! We don't need any towels.

24:00.375 --> 24:03.208
No! No! We do need towels.
Leave 'em out front, please!

24:03.208 --> 24:05.333
We've been here ten minutes.
You need more towels?

24:05.333 --> 24:07.166
You use 30 towels after every shower.

24:07.166 --> 24:08.666
I'm sorry. At least I shower.

24:08.666 --> 24:10.041
All right, you got me there.

24:10.041 --> 24:11.958
[Francisco] It's me, Francisco!

24:11.958 --> 24:12.958
Francisco?

24:12.958 --> 24:15.083
Wait, wait, wait. What if he's the killer?

24:15.083 --> 24:17.583
The only thing
he wants to murder is your hm-hm!

24:17.583 --> 24:18.500
Hey!

24:18.500 --> 24:20.875
- [Francisco] Hurry! There's no time!
- [Nick] Be right there!

24:20.875 --> 24:22.666
- [Audrey] We're hurrying!
- [Nick] We know!

24:25.291 --> 24:26.208
So sorry.

24:26.208 --> 24:27.458
- [Nick] Hey.
- Hey.

24:29.291 --> 24:30.750
- You.
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.

24:31.375 --> 24:32.375
Gorgeous.

24:33.750 --> 24:35.416
[Nick] Jesus Christ. All right.

24:36.166 --> 24:37.708
[Audrey] Put this back. You said hurry.

24:37.708 --> 24:39.750
What's... How can we help?

24:39.750 --> 24:41.500
- I have information.
- [Nick] Yes.

24:41.500 --> 24:43.791
Everyone thinks Claudette
is this gold digger,

24:43.791 --> 24:47.500
but what's not so well known
is the fact that, as a precaution,

24:47.500 --> 24:50.625
the board made her sign a brutal prenup.

24:50.625 --> 24:55.250
So that means if Vik divorces her,
she's left with nothin'.

24:56.250 --> 24:58.291
[dramatic music swells]

24:58.291 --> 25:01.375
- I gotta move this shit again?
- Wait. Wait. Who is it?

25:01.375 --> 25:03.875
[Claudette] It's Claudette.
You must hear what I have to say.

25:03.875 --> 25:05.458
Okay, one second.

25:05.458 --> 25:06.875
Let's get you in the closet.

25:06.875 --> 25:09.250
[Nick] Okay, be right there.
I gotta get some cheese.

25:09.250 --> 25:11.458
- Okay. Just go in there.
- [rock scraping floor]

25:11.458 --> 25:13.708
No! Get off of... Jesus!

25:13.708 --> 25:15.541
- Coming, Claudette!
- Sorry! One second.

25:15.541 --> 25:17.208
[breathing heavily]

25:17.208 --> 25:18.125
[Nick] Hurry!

25:18.875 --> 25:20.708
- [Audrey] Hello, Claudette.
- [Nick] Hi.

25:20.708 --> 25:22.083
[Claudette sighs]

25:23.166 --> 25:24.958
[Claudette]
They all think I'm marrying Vik

25:24.958 --> 25:26.916
just for the money,
especially the Countess.

25:27.875 --> 25:29.791
She's been jealous of me
ever since we met.

25:29.791 --> 25:31.916
- Really? I can imagine why.
- I can imagine.

25:31.916 --> 25:34.333
But still, she was my best friend.

25:34.333 --> 25:35.416
- Right.
- [Nick] Sure.

25:35.416 --> 25:36.708
- You know?
- Yeah.

25:36.708 --> 25:38.666
- We were so close.
- [Audrey] Oh!

25:38.666 --> 25:40.833
And I think I just miss her sometimes.

25:41.416 --> 25:44.541
- Oh, sorry.
- [Claudette sobbing]

25:44.541 --> 25:47.458
- I just wanna know who kidnapped my Vik.
- Mm-hmm.

25:47.458 --> 25:49.708
They all have something to gain from this.

25:49.708 --> 25:52.875
Pfft!

25:52.875 --> 25:55.208
- Terrible.
- [Claudette] I can't trust any of them!

25:55.208 --> 25:56.791
- [whispers] There's a gun.
- A gun?

25:56.791 --> 25:59.041
[Claudette] The Colonel,
so bitter about his demotion.

25:59.041 --> 26:01.375
Saira, always starved for attention.

26:02.041 --> 26:04.500
And Vik had just discovered

26:04.500 --> 26:06.166
Francisco's dark secret.

26:06.166 --> 26:08.000
- [Audrey] What?
- [Nick] He had a secret?

26:08.000 --> 26:09.458
- Oh!
- [Nick] Oh God.

26:09.458 --> 26:10.750
- [cocks gun]
- [Audrey gasps]

26:10.750 --> 26:13.208
- [Audrey] We don't need to do that.
- [Nick] That's cool.

26:13.208 --> 26:14.208
Who is it?

26:14.208 --> 26:15.583
It's Saira. Let me in.

26:15.583 --> 26:16.666
Uh, okay. One second.

26:16.666 --> 26:18.500
- I need to hide. The closet!
<i>-</i> No, no, no!

26:18.500 --> 26:20.375
- [Nick] It's too dark.
- Here. Come on.

26:20.375 --> 26:22.500
- [Nick] She has all her stuff.
- One second, Saira!

26:22.500 --> 26:23.833
[Nick] Coming! Be right there!

26:23.833 --> 26:26.041
[Nick straining]

26:26.041 --> 26:27.875
Okay, gotta get to you!

26:27.875 --> 26:30.666
- So sorry. One second.
- Moving around some stuff for fun!

26:31.875 --> 26:34.125
- I know who you need to be looking at.
- [Nick] Who?

26:34.125 --> 26:35.708
- Claudette!
- [Nick] Claudette?

26:35.708 --> 26:38.333
[Saira] I told Vik she was bad news
the minute I met her.

26:38.333 --> 26:40.250
She's suspicious,
narcissistic, manipulative,

26:40.250 --> 26:42.458
and looks cheap as well
in that red dress--

26:42.458 --> 26:45.916
Excuse me! I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but I feel like I'd be a rude hostess

26:45.916 --> 26:49.250
if I didn't offer you a piece of this
exquisite artisan cheese that's...

26:49.250 --> 26:51.875
Nick, where's this...
Where's that cheese? The big--

26:51.875 --> 26:53.333
- The cheese is gone.
- Where is it?

26:53.333 --> 26:54.541
I put it, uh, in my stomach.

26:54.541 --> 26:56.291
You ate that entire block of cheese?

26:56.291 --> 26:59.791
Trying to shame me. I don't know
if that's gonna get the cheese back--

26:59.791 --> 27:01.916
I'm sorry. I don't mean to be selfish--

27:01.916 --> 27:03.375
Sorry. Hold on. You know what?

27:03.375 --> 27:07.291
Let me give you a drink right now
just to relax you a little bit.

27:07.291 --> 27:08.541
- Here.
- I... I don't want that.

27:08.541 --> 27:10.500
- No? Okay.
- I'm okay.

27:10.500 --> 27:11.666
[frantic knocking]

27:11.666 --> 27:13.875
- Oh shit.
- [Saira] Who is it?

27:13.875 --> 27:15.666
- [Audrey] Not sure.
- You expecting someone?

27:15.666 --> 27:18.000
It's like an after-party.
People just show up.

27:18.000 --> 27:21.083
Let's put you into the bedroom,
just in case, 'cause I don't know.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.333
- I'll hide there.
- Don't hide in there! Why?

27:23.333 --> 27:24.333
That's an obvious spot.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.625
- [Audrey] Is it hot in here?
- I'm hot too.

27:26.625 --> 27:28.166
- I'm coming!
- [knocking continues]

27:28.166 --> 27:29.500
What if <i>that</i> is the killer?

27:29.500 --> 27:32.583
Don't you kinda want it
to be the killer so they can kill us?

27:32.583 --> 27:33.916
I am sick of this shit.

27:33.916 --> 27:35.916
- Baby, I do not feel very good.
- [rock scraping]

27:35.916 --> 27:37.250
[lock clicking]

27:37.250 --> 27:39.583
What's doin'? Yeah?

27:40.375 --> 27:42.083
Hey, great to see you.

27:42.083 --> 27:44.000
What's going on? [chuckles lightly]

27:46.166 --> 27:47.166
[door closes]

27:47.166 --> 27:48.500
[Countess] I know who did it.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.666
Who?

27:51.916 --> 27:53.250
It was Francisco.

27:53.250 --> 27:54.666
Francisco!

27:54.666 --> 27:58.000
He has had over 85 paternity suits
filed against him.

27:58.000 --> 28:00.250
We suspect he's been siphoning money
out of the company

28:00.250 --> 28:02.875
in order to pay
for all of these babies he made.

28:02.875 --> 28:04.708
That's a lie!

28:04.708 --> 28:06.125
Not the part about the babies.

28:06.125 --> 28:09.083
Yes, that's true.
I've spread my seed far and wide,

28:09.083 --> 28:11.916
but I have never stolen in my life.

28:11.916 --> 28:14.416
- What are you doing here?
- An excellent question.

28:14.416 --> 28:17.083
- What are you all doing here?
- Saira's here.

28:18.125 --> 28:20.333
- Nobody move!
- Oh my God!

28:20.333 --> 28:21.375
I ain't moving.

28:21.375 --> 28:22.916

28:23.875 --> 28:24.791
It's mine. It's mine.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.750
- I missed it.
- [Nick] Missed the call?

28:28.375 --> 28:29.208
[phone beeping]

28:29.916 --> 28:30.916
I have a message.

28:34.208 --> 28:35.916
[distorted voice] <i>We have the Maharajah.</i>

28:36.416 --> 28:39.250
<i>If you contact the authorities, he dies.</i>

28:39.250 --> 28:41.541
<i>We'll make our demands
known to you at 7:00 a.m.</i>

28:41.541 --> 28:42.583
[call disconnects]

28:42.583 --> 28:45.458
That voice is hysterical.
You got to admit it.

28:45.458 --> 28:47.625
So we should all stay here.
Correct, Colonel?

28:47.625 --> 28:51.166
Because one of us is definitely
working with the kidnapper.

28:51.166 --> 28:55.041
Yeah. Motives, opportunities.

28:55.041 --> 28:56.375
Somebody here.

28:56.375 --> 28:58.541
My head is spinning a little bit.

28:58.541 --> 28:59.958
Honey?

29:00.750 --> 29:04.583
Babe, are you taking a nap?
I'm tired, too, so let's, uh...

29:05.416 --> 29:07.791
Nobody leave here
until we figure out who did what.

29:07.791 --> 29:09.291
It's great to see everybody.

29:09.291 --> 29:11.750
- Thanks for coming over. Sorry, my bad.

Get up. Get up! We got roofied.

29:39.541 --> 29:42.458
- What happened?
- [Audrey] Baby. Oh my God! We fell asleep!

29:42.458 --> 29:43.750
- [Nick] Oh yeah?
- Honey!

29:43.750 --> 29:44.833

29:44.833 --> 29:47.375

- [Nick] Okay. Up. I'm up.

29:49.625 --> 29:50.708
[Audrey] Who did this?

29:50.708 --> 29:52.958
[Nick] What? Now they're just showing off.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.375
- [Audrey] Hurry up!
- [Nick] Okay, I'm coming, honey. So...

29:56.375 --> 29:58.125
- [Audrey] Get up!
- [Nick] I'm up!

29:58.875 --> 30:02.000
- Calm down before you say anything.
- Nobody drugs us and gets away with it!

30:02.000 --> 30:03.666
- Maybe they didn't drug us.
- It's illegal!

30:03.666 --> 30:04.958
Maybe we just ate too much.

30:04.958 --> 30:08.083
- That's why we passed out.
- Nick. Audrey. Just in time.

30:08.666 --> 30:09.916
- For what?
- For what?

30:09.916 --> 30:12.000
The real detectives have just arrived.

30:12.000 --> 30:14.166
[intense music playing]

30:18.125 --> 30:19.291
[Colonel] Connor Miller.

30:19.291 --> 30:22.625
- [Audrey gasps]
- Former MI6 hostage negotiator.

30:22.625 --> 30:25.750
Oh my God.
Specializes in high-profile cases.

30:25.750 --> 30:28.250
He got the President of Uruguay's son
back from the cartel.

30:28.250 --> 30:30.208
- He wrote the book. He wrote the book.
- On what?

30:30.208 --> 30:32.416
How Rogaine doesn't work for everybody?

30:32.416 --> 30:34.416
The book! Our course detective book!

30:36.416 --> 30:38.916
[Miller] Greetings.
I hear you need a case solved.

30:40.208 --> 30:42.333
Colonel. Been a long time.

30:42.916 --> 30:44.333
Francisco Perez.

30:44.333 --> 30:45.583
Huh?

30:45.583 --> 30:46.750
Big fan.

30:46.750 --> 30:47.916
- Oh.
- Hey.

30:47.916 --> 30:51.291
Mr. Miller, we're also very big fans.
Um, we can bring you up to speed.

30:51.291 --> 30:54.666
So what we know already is that
this is at least a two-person job.

30:54.666 --> 30:58.375
I saw the first guy
escape with Vik on a boat,

30:58.375 --> 31:00.375
leaving the second guy
still on the island.

31:00.375 --> 31:03.166
Also, just so you know,
we were both drugged last night.

31:03.166 --> 31:05.666
I don't know if we were drugged.
We did have a few drinks--

31:05.666 --> 31:07.250
- You must be the Spitzes.
- Yes.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.833
Yes, we are!

31:08.833 --> 31:10.666
Your reputations precede you.

31:10.666 --> 31:11.958
- There you go.
- Why, thank you.

31:11.958 --> 31:14.875
- That's nice to hear.
- Uh, not in a positive way, I'm afraid.

31:14.875 --> 31:16.000
Okay.

31:16.000 --> 31:19.125
I understand the last time
you were involved in something like this,

31:19.125 --> 31:20.333
everybody died?

31:20.333 --> 31:22.625
Well, that was not the Maharajah.

31:22.625 --> 31:24.125
How's he doing now?

31:24.125 --> 31:25.375
- [laughs] Okay.
- Right.

31:25.375 --> 31:28.041
The Colonel's still here,
most of him, so there. That's good.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.708
Um, listen.
Mr. Miller, I read your book, and--

31:30.708 --> 31:33.000
[Miller] Colonel, I wanna see
all the security footage.

31:33.000 --> 31:35.208
All the footage
was wiped from the mainframe.

31:35.208 --> 31:36.791
Yeah, 'cause it's an inside job.

31:36.791 --> 31:37.833
Mademoiselle Joubert,

31:37.833 --> 31:40.333
we'll need your phone
for a vocal analysis of the voice mail.

31:40.333 --> 31:41.541
Of course. Anything you need.

31:41.541 --> 31:45.125
They're professional, no doubt.
They were concise and brief on the phone.

31:45.125 --> 31:46.375
We also have reason to believe

31:46.375 --> 31:49.250
that the inside man
was posing as an elephant handler.

31:50.458 --> 31:52.708
You really wanna do
suspects now, Mrs. Spitz?

31:52.708 --> 31:54.000
- Sure.
- [Miller] Fine.

31:54.000 --> 31:55.916
How about this? Uh...

31:55.916 --> 31:58.708
A husband and wife,
one an NYPD almost-detective,

31:58.708 --> 32:01.375
the other a hairdresser
taking online classes.

32:01.375 --> 32:03.875
Together they run
a private detective agency

32:03.875 --> 32:05.625
teetering on the edge of bankruptcy.

32:05.625 --> 32:07.083
And if I were to hazard a guess,

32:07.083 --> 32:09.375
I'd say it's probably
taking a toll on their marriage.

32:09.958 --> 32:12.250
Desperate to give validity
to their failing business,

32:12.250 --> 32:16.125
they accept a last-minute invite
from a billionaire to attend his wedding.

32:16.125 --> 32:17.625
And so a plan is born.

32:17.625 --> 32:21.125
Twenty-four hours after their arrival,
there's a high-profile kidnapping,

32:21.125 --> 32:22.708
the sort that gets attention.

32:22.708 --> 32:24.208
A career maker.

32:25.000 --> 32:28.583
How's my reasoning, fellow... detectives?

32:28.583 --> 32:30.833
- Pretty excellent. None of it was true.
- Gorgeous.

32:30.833 --> 32:33.416
I was starting to go with it
'cause of the way you phrase things.

32:33.416 --> 32:35.166
- I almost believed him.
- The accent helps.

32:35.750 --> 32:38.458
Call trace is ready. Kidnappers should be
calling in any minute.

32:38.458 --> 32:40.208
If you'll excuse me, I have a job to do.

32:40.208 --> 32:41.833
- Okay, so listen.
- [Audrey] Yes, honey.

32:41.833 --> 32:45.166
We got good cheese. We got free iPhones.
I'm happy with everything.

32:45.166 --> 32:48.333
Where are you going? Did you hear
what that guy just said about us?

32:48.333 --> 32:50.041
- [Nick] Yeah.
- None of that's true!

32:50.041 --> 32:53.250
We need to show those people
what Nick and Audrey Spitz are all about.

32:53.250 --> 32:55.333
The guy's good! I don't think he needs us.

32:55.333 --> 32:56.833
- Nick. Audrey.
- [both] What?

32:56.833 --> 32:59.791
The kidnapper says
he'll only talk to the man he shot at.

32:59.791 --> 33:01.666
They need us. All right. They need us.

33:01.666 --> 33:02.666
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

- [Colonel] They're here.

33:09.125 --> 33:11.041
- [Miller] He's calling back in a minute.
- Okay.

33:11.041 --> 33:13.208
You need to keep him calm,
keep him talking.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.833
- We need at least--
- Forty-five seconds.

33:14.833 --> 33:18.166
- I know. It's not my first rodeo, pal.
- You've done hostage negotiation?

33:18.166 --> 33:21.291
I'm married to this lady.
Everything's a negotiation. I got it.

33:21.291 --> 33:22.291

[kidnapper] <i>Is this the man
who tried to stop me on my escape?</i>

33:38.708 --> 33:40.916
Yes, yes, yes, the man you shot at.

33:40.916 --> 33:43.625
Luckily, I got out of the way. [chuckles]

33:43.625 --> 33:46.083
Tell me what we can do
to get Vik back safely.

Great. Just lost the trace. Thanks.

34:04.041 --> 34:07.125
- It's my fault? This guy's yelling shit--
- Why are you yelling at me?

34:07.125 --> 34:09.125
- You were directing at me--
- I yelled at that guy!

34:09.125 --> 34:12.125

34:16.291 --> 34:19.416
Yeah. Calm down. This is how
we communicate. We're from New York.

34:19.416 --> 34:20.958
Can we remain calm?

34:20.958 --> 34:22.583
- I'm sorry. Of course.
- We're calm.

34:22.583 --> 34:23.958
He wants the money. He's gonna call back.

- Why are you saying this?
- He can't hear--

36:55.958 --> 36:58.875
That's like me saying you wear Spanx
in front of a supermodel.

36:58.875 --> 37:02.375
So, uh, I'll take the gun
'cause I'm very good with a gun.

37:02.375 --> 37:05.541
They used to call me "Nicky Guns"
on the force. That was my nickname.

37:05.541 --> 37:09.666
Gang members used to ask me for advice
on the weekends 'cause I shot so well.

37:09.666 --> 37:11.583
I'd say, "I can't.
I don't wanna help you guys."

37:11.583 --> 37:12.666
You take the gun.

37:12.666 --> 37:15.333
I'll take the gun.
I got the phone, and you got the money.

37:15.333 --> 37:18.458
When they call, I want you to follow
the three rules of ransom drops

37:18.458 --> 37:19.833
from Chapter 12 of my book.

37:19.833 --> 37:21.708
Can you do that? Remember what they are?

37:21.708 --> 37:25.666
Number one.
Um, follow all reasonable instructions.

37:25.666 --> 37:26.958
- Yes.
- [Audrey] Number two.

37:26.958 --> 37:31.041
Do not hand off the ransom
until you see the kidnappee.

37:31.041 --> 37:31.958
[Miller] Exactly.

37:31.958 --> 37:36.083
And number three. Do not go
to a secondary location with them.

37:36.666 --> 37:38.333
Perfect. You'll be fine.

37:38.333 --> 37:39.625
Off you go.

37:39.625 --> 37:41.750
- Okay.
- "Nicky Guns" style. Let's go!

37:41.750 --> 37:43.833
[tense music playing]

37:49.416 --> 37:51.500
- Cool.
- I'm gonna hand you this.

37:52.000 --> 37:54.666
You gotta tell me
who on earth ever called you "Nicky Guns."

37:54.666 --> 37:57.958
You gotta tell me who <i>didn't</i> call me that.
Everybody called me that.

37:57.958 --> 37:59.708
This is the heaviest goddamn

37:59.708 --> 38:01.125

38:03.166 --> 38:04.625
<i>My hands are killing me.</i>

38:04.625 --> 38:06.708
<i>I'm gonna go two hands.
Does that look weird?</i>

38:06.708 --> 38:09.458
- [Audrey] <i>Your hands are cute.</i>
- [Nick] <i>"Cute"? What does that mean?</i>

38:09.458 --> 38:11.916
- You have cute hands.
<i>-</i> Your family has orangutan ha--

38:11.916 --> 38:14.000
You grew up thinking
giant hands are normal.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.458
[Audrey] <i>I never said dainty hands.</i>

38:15.458 --> 38:18.041
<i>I said it's weird to high-five you
'cause your hands are little.</i>

38:18.041 --> 38:19.666
[Nick] <i>They're average hands.</i>

38:19.666 --> 38:22.041
- Your grandmother can palm a bulldog.
- [Audrey] Oh, please.

38:22.041 --> 38:22.958
[phone ringing]

38:22.958 --> 38:24.833
Shit, shit, shit. That's the phone.

38:24.833 --> 38:26.041
Okay, here we go.

38:26.041 --> 38:27.583
<i>Initiate the trace.</i>

38:27.583 --> 38:33.166
Hi. Bonjour, uh, madame or
mademoiselle or monsieur. Go ahead.

38:33.166 --> 38:34.250
[Vik] <i>Nick, it's me!</i>

38:34.250 --> 38:35.333
[screams]

38:35.333 --> 38:36.500
[Nick] <i>Rajah! You okay?</i>

38:36.500 --> 38:39.958
So we got the money, and we just
need to know where to bring it.

38:39.958 --> 38:42.083
So tell us,
and we'll get you out of there.

38:42.083 --> 38:43.791
- [Vik yelps]
- What happened?

38:43.791 --> 38:47.416
[kidnapper] <i>You have your proof of life.
Now take the money to the van at the curb.</i>

38:47.416 --> 38:48.416
Okay.

38:48.416 --> 38:50.791
- Wh-- Wh-- What van?
- Van?

38:50.791 --> 38:52.958
What van are we talking about?
That van there?

38:52.958 --> 38:55.916
[kidnapper] <i>Don't point, you idiot!
Just casually walk in that direction.</i>

38:55.916 --> 38:57.208
Okay. Okay. I'm coming.

[kidnapper] <i>Anything out of the ordinary,
and the Maharajah dies.</i>

38:59.791 --> 39:01.583
Don't do that. Okay, we're coming.

39:02.250 --> 39:03.625
We gotta go to the van.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.333
- That van?
- No! Don't point.

39:05.333 --> 39:06.875
He doesn't like pointing. That van.

39:09.083 --> 39:09.916
Oh shit.

39:09.916 --> 39:11.416
Get in the van.

39:11.416 --> 39:14.291
We'll give you the money
in exchange for the Maharajah.

39:14.291 --> 39:15.291
He's not far.

39:15.291 --> 39:17.166
<i>Get in the van.</i>

39:17.166 --> 39:19.625
- Don't get in the van!
- [Claudette speaking French]

39:19.625 --> 39:22.458
- That wasn't part of the deal.
- Number three. Don't get in the van.

39:22.458 --> 39:25.333
Get in the van,
or I'll shoot you both in the stomach,

39:25.333 --> 39:28.083
take you to the countryside,
and feed you to the swine.

39:28.083 --> 39:30.458
- Okay. Let's get in the van.
- Okay, okay, okay.

39:30.458 --> 39:32.125
Okay, sorry. Yes, yes, yes, yes.

- Give us the money!
- Give you the money.

39:48.083 --> 39:50.500
- All right. You got it.
- Just give him the money!

39:50.500 --> 39:52.375
- One second.
- I do have these too.

39:52.375 --> 39:53.708
What the fuck?

39:53.708 --> 39:56.500
I brought these for us
in case we wanted to celebrate after,

39:56.500 --> 39:58.166
but I'm gonna change the plans.

39:58.166 --> 40:02.166
So what I'll do is put this on here,
and I'll put this on here.

- Hello?

40:10.166 --> 40:11.291
We're offline?

40:11.291 --> 40:12.541
Stand by.

40:12.541 --> 40:15.958
Take us to the Maharajah now.
What do you think of that?

40:15.958 --> 40:17.250
Chop off his hand.

40:17.250 --> 40:18.375
- Chop off my hand?
- What?

40:18.375 --> 40:20.041
- [kidnapper] Yes!
- No! Hatchet!

40:20.041 --> 40:21.875
- Find the key.
- I do know where the key is.

40:21.875 --> 40:23.541
- Look in here.
- No, no, no. Shoot.

40:23.541 --> 40:25.750
- Shoot, I can't find it.
- Check your other pockets!

I didn't take a cheese knife.
I took the cheese!

Why did you grab it?
Why did you have cheese?

I had cheese

That knife never left the room, Nick.

stole the knife so they could deepfake us.

No problem. Yeah, we'll be there.

Oh my God!

46:18.291 --> 46:21.000
[Audrey whispering] N-E-4-1-3-D-A-N.

46:21.000 --> 46:23.541
We're Europe's most wanted again.
We better run!

46:23.541 --> 46:25.541
- I'm gonna grab... Okay.
- Grab that hat.

46:26.250 --> 46:28.125
- What is... Um...
- [Nick] What is this?

46:28.125 --> 46:31.416
- [Delacroix speaking French]
- [Nick] It's Delacroix! That guy loves us.

46:31.416 --> 46:33.458
[continues in French]

46:33.458 --> 46:36.166
- I understood "opera." Okay. Go, go, go!
- Okay. Okay.

46:38.125 --> 46:40.750
[people clamoring on TV]

46:40.750 --> 46:43.875
[both singing "Flower Duet" by Delibes]

47:13.791 --> 47:15.250
- [gasps] How?
- [Audrey] Surprise!

47:15.250 --> 47:16.291
Audrey and Nick!

47:16.291 --> 47:19.583
- Smoke rings! How you doing?
- Hi! Did you get our Christmas card?

47:19.583 --> 47:22.750
I'm fine, and yes.
The matching sweaters were a nice touch.

47:22.750 --> 47:24.375
- [laughs softly]
- That was my idea.

47:24.375 --> 47:26.916
So, hey, we need a little bit of help.

47:26.916 --> 47:28.708
- We need a lot of help.
- [Nick] Yeah.

47:29.291 --> 47:31.250
- You are under arrest.
- [Nick] No!

47:32.125 --> 47:34.083
I can never tell
when you're being serious.

47:34.083 --> 47:35.708
He looks serious. Are you serious?

47:35.708 --> 47:37.708
For kidnapping the Maharajah,

47:37.708 --> 47:39.208
murdering his bodyguard,

47:39.208 --> 47:41.666
stealing $70 million,

47:41.666 --> 47:43.916
destroying many city blocks,

47:43.916 --> 47:46.041
and, I'm assuming,
sneaking into the opera.

47:46.041 --> 47:48.916
- We didn't do all of that.
- We did number four and number six.

47:48.916 --> 47:50.458
We're just... We're being framed.

47:50.458 --> 47:52.375
[Nick] We got a hunch who really did it.

47:52.375 --> 47:54.541
We need you to track
this license plate for us.

47:54.541 --> 47:56.791
Nothing would give me greater pleasure,

47:56.791 --> 48:00.958
but then I would have to immediately
report such help to my superiors,

48:00.958 --> 48:03.291
or I would be guilty
of aiding and abetting.

48:03.291 --> 48:05.291
How's this? We can tie you up,

48:05.291 --> 48:08.458
and then you can say
we forced you into helping us.

48:08.458 --> 48:09.708
[sighs]

48:09.708 --> 48:11.333
Wait, wait. Who are you calling?

48:11.333 --> 48:12.958
I'm not calling anyone.

48:12.958 --> 48:16.125
I have an app
to track the vehicle with that plate.

48:16.125 --> 48:17.750
They have an app for that?

48:17.750 --> 48:19.041
- [Delacroix] Mm-hmm.
- Tsk!

48:19.041 --> 48:21.541
God. You got Shazam on that after?

48:21.541 --> 48:23.791
I just... I wanna know what song this is.

48:24.708 --> 48:28.375
[Nick] So the app says
the truck is parked out by a château

48:28.375 --> 48:30.083
that's 80 kilometers away?

48:30.083 --> 48:31.916
[Delacroix] Mm-hmm. Excuse me.

48:31.916 --> 48:33.250
Can you scratch my nose?

48:34.250 --> 48:35.083
Oh.

48:35.083 --> 48:36.583
Uh... Uh, softer.

48:36.583 --> 48:39.250
Softer. Hmm. [moaning]

48:41.375 --> 48:43.916
- Thank you.
- Also, do you have a car we can borrow?

48:44.583 --> 48:46.458
- The keys are in my pants pocket.
- [Audrey] Okay.

48:46.458 --> 48:49.958
You talking to Audrey on that one too?
I'll handle the pants pocket.

48:49.958 --> 48:52.583
What can I say?
[chuckles] Shooters gotta shoot.

48:52.583 --> 48:53.625
[Nick chuckles]

48:53.625 --> 48:56.833
Okay, is this a potato or a key
'cause I'm... Okay, got it.

48:56.833 --> 48:58.625
- [Audrey] We'll take care of it.
- Hey, hey.

48:58.625 --> 49:00.416
Okay, no food in my car.

49:02.041 --> 49:05.625
[Nick] Man, I bet Delacroix's
got a sick-ass vehicle.

49:07.375 --> 49:08.958
[vehicle humming]

49:08.958 --> 49:11.291
[Édith Piaf song playing over radio]

49:11.291 --> 49:12.583
[Colonel speaking indistinctly]

49:12.583 --> 49:13.750
[cell phone ringing]

49:14.333 --> 49:15.333
[Colonel] Excuse me.

49:17.666 --> 49:18.875
Bonsoir, Inspector.

49:18.875 --> 49:20.791
- Bonsoir, Colonel!
<i>- Enchanté!</i>

49:26.291 --> 49:27.750
The police are looking for you.

49:27.750 --> 49:30.625
Yeah, no kidding.
Colonel, we did not do this.

49:30.625 --> 49:31.708
[Colonel] <i>I know that,</i>

49:31.708 --> 49:34.291
but they have your fingerprints
all over the murder weapon

49:34.291 --> 49:36.666
and footage of you
running out of the tent with it.

49:36.666 --> 49:39.916
- [Nick] Yeah.
- Typical Spitz vacation insanity.

49:39.916 --> 49:42.083
Miller's dead, by the way,
and we lost the money.

49:42.083 --> 49:43.666
It just looks like you took it.

49:43.666 --> 49:46.750
<i>It gets worse! The kidnappers just called.
They've given us</i>

49:46.750 --> 49:48.750
a midnight deadline
to come up with the money,

49:48.750 --> 49:50.333
or they will kill the Maharajah.

49:50.333 --> 49:52.833
Okay, Colonel,
will you just stall for us until then?

49:52.833 --> 49:55.083
- [Nick] <i>Merci beaucoup!</i>
- [Audrey] <i>Thank you, Colonel!</i>

50:02.333 --> 50:05.041
[car motor humming]

50:08.666 --> 50:09.875
Oh my God!

50:09.875 --> 50:13.041
Well, now you know why
the kidnapper needs $70 million.

50:13.041 --> 50:14.416
For the heating bill.

50:17.833 --> 50:19.125
- [inhales sharply]
- [Nick] Uh-huh.

50:19.125 --> 50:20.416
Oh boy.

50:20.416 --> 50:24.333
Okay, so that moat's, like, three meters?

50:24.833 --> 50:26.041
I think I can clear that.

50:26.041 --> 50:28.333
Nick, three meters is, like, ten feet.

50:28.333 --> 50:30.916
I had the high school record
for the long jump.

50:30.916 --> 50:33.958
And I'm not kidding.
I went further than that back in the day.

50:33.958 --> 50:35.833
- Hmm. Did you?
- Yeah.

50:35.833 --> 50:38.833
What'd they call you back then?
"Nicky Long Legs"?

50:38.833 --> 50:39.750
You're mocking me?

50:39.750 --> 50:41.916
[Audrey] You're not gonna make that jump.

50:41.916 --> 50:44.416
It doesn't make me feel good
to prove you wrong, but I'm gonna.

50:44.416 --> 50:45.916
- All right?
- [Audrey] Mm-hmm.

50:49.083 --> 50:52.125
Okay, from that angle,
it does look further than three meters.

50:52.125 --> 50:53.541
- Oh shoot.
- What do you think?

50:53.541 --> 50:56.958
- Do you think maybe you could do it?
- Now you want me to make that jump?

50:56.958 --> 50:58.041
[gun cocks]

50:59.041 --> 51:00.125
Bonsoir.

51:00.125 --> 51:01.458
[both] Countess?

51:01.458 --> 51:02.875
Surprised?

51:02.875 --> 51:03.875
[both] Yeah.

51:03.875 --> 51:05.833
- Did you hear we just said...
- [both] "Countess?"

51:07.666 --> 51:08.541
Oh God.

51:10.125 --> 51:11.166
[Audrey groans]

51:11.750 --> 51:13.000
Where's Vik?

51:14.208 --> 51:15.750
I guess the kidnappers have him.

51:15.750 --> 51:17.708
Kid... You're not the kidnappers?

51:17.708 --> 51:18.791
No, no, no.

51:19.375 --> 51:22.416
I would never do such a thing.
Vikram is my friend.

51:22.416 --> 51:23.541
[scoffs] Your friend.

51:24.041 --> 51:24.958
You loved him.

51:26.166 --> 51:27.750
[coughing] Oh God!

51:27.750 --> 51:29.541
- I love money.
- Hmm, hmm, hmm.

51:29.541 --> 51:32.666
When I heard you two amateurs
are gonna be handling so much of it,

51:32.666 --> 51:33.791
I just had to have it.

51:33.791 --> 51:35.916
"Had to have it." [giggles]

51:35.916 --> 51:38.708
- So you didn't plant that knife?
- Or deepfake that footage?

51:38.708 --> 51:41.208
Or slip something
into our drinks that night at the villa?

51:41.208 --> 51:44.916
- Why bring that up? It's not relevant.
- [Audrey] Of course that is relevant!

51:44.916 --> 51:47.625
- It's extremely relev--
- All right! All right! Jesus!

51:47.625 --> 51:48.541
- God!
- [Nick] Yo.

51:48.541 --> 51:50.750
Two bad guys never works out.

51:50.750 --> 51:53.791
- One always double-crosses the other.
- [Audrey] It's a cliché of the genre.

51:53.791 --> 51:56.083
- We've seen this before. Trust us.
- So many times.

51:56.083 --> 51:57.166
- Save yourself.
- Please.

51:57.166 --> 51:59.750
Imani? Is the car ready for our getaway?

51:59.750 --> 52:01.541
- Yes, Countess.
- [Countess] Brilliant.

52:02.375 --> 52:03.833
- No!
- No! Don't!

52:03.833 --> 52:05.166
[gasps]

52:06.208 --> 52:08.416
- [Audrey] Oh my God.
- I couldn't have been more clear.

52:08.416 --> 52:09.791
[Audrey] That is the cliché.

52:09.791 --> 52:11.041
- Yeah.
- Right there.

52:11.041 --> 52:11.958
[Nick] Mm-hmm.

52:11.958 --> 52:15.833
With any luck, the smoke will get to you
before the flames do.

52:19.083 --> 52:20.416
- [both gasp]
- No!

52:21.083 --> 52:21.916
Oops.

52:23.833 --> 52:25.000
- [gunshots]
- [gasps]

52:26.708 --> 52:27.625
[Audrey] What?

52:27.625 --> 52:29.875
Triple cross.

52:29.875 --> 52:31.791
[chuckles, groans]

52:34.541 --> 52:37.750
Oh my God. We are so getting blamed
for both those assholes being dead.

52:37.750 --> 52:38.791
[Nick] Let's go!

52:38.791 --> 52:40.166
- We gotta hop out of here!
- Okay!

52:40.166 --> 52:42.833
- Come on! Let's go! Let's go! Together!
- [Audrey yelps]

52:42.833 --> 52:44.583
- Oh my God!
- Go, go, go! Back, back, back!

52:44.583 --> 52:46.333
To the window! To the window! Go, go!

52:46.333 --> 52:47.291
Back, back, back!

52:47.291 --> 52:48.541
- [Audrey] Oh shit!
- [groans]

52:48.541 --> 52:49.958
- [Audrey] Jesus!
- Are you okay?

52:49.958 --> 52:52.166
- [Audrey] Are you okay?
- [Nick] You gotta roll away.

52:52.166 --> 52:54.000
- [Audrey groans]
- No! That way!

52:54.000 --> 52:54.916
[Audrey groans]

52:54.916 --> 52:56.625
Oh my God, you're so big!

52:56.625 --> 53:00.166
That's what you said on our honeymoon,
but like then, we gotta keep trying.

53:00.166 --> 53:01.833
[both groaning]

53:01.833 --> 53:05.750
Oh my God, honey! I don't even know
where we're rolling to, honey!

53:05.750 --> 53:08.083
- [Nick] I don't know!
- [Audrey] Oh my God!

53:09.000 --> 53:10.708
I was the one who roofied us.

53:11.291 --> 53:12.541
Wha-- What?

53:12.541 --> 53:15.125
I mean, you did it,
but it was because of me.

53:15.125 --> 53:19.583
I keep my Ambien in the Advil bottle
that you use, and I...

53:19.583 --> 53:21.666
I just get so stressed out. I'm sorry.

53:21.666 --> 53:22.666
It was all me.

53:22.666 --> 53:25.458
Don't apologize.
I'm the one who needs to apologize.

53:25.458 --> 53:28.500
I have been criticizing you so much.
I feel terrible.

53:28.500 --> 53:30.125
- I'm sorry.
- No. It doesn't matter.

53:30.125 --> 53:32.375
Your billboards
and dental floss business cards--

53:32.375 --> 53:35.250
- Dental floss business cards.
- [Audrey] I know, and I didn't think...

53:35.250 --> 53:37.791
- It's not that it was a bad idea--
- The razor thing on the card!

53:37.791 --> 53:40.541
I can use it to cut the tape!
I got one in my pocket!

53:40.541 --> 53:42.458
- Where?
- Right here in the back pocket.

53:42.458 --> 53:44.625
[Audrey] Oh! Hold on. Hold on! Hold on!

53:44.625 --> 53:45.958
I'm trying to find it.

53:45.958 --> 53:47.333
[Nick] Help me. Help me. Get it.

53:47.333 --> 53:48.416
Get it. Get it. Reach.

53:48.416 --> 53:51.375
- Reach down. Down. Please, God.
- [Audrey] Got it. I got it!

53:51.375 --> 53:53.291
Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God.

53:53.291 --> 53:54.916
Are we good? Are we cutting this?

53:54.916 --> 53:56.625
- Is it working?
- I think it's working.

53:56.625 --> 53:58.416
[Audrey] Oh my God!

53:58.416 --> 54:00.166
I love you, dental floss business cards.

54:00.166 --> 54:02.500
I love you so much.
Oh, please, please, please.

Yes! Yes!

54:03.791 --> 54:05.125
Yes!

Get the feet.

- I got it!
- [Nick] Come on! Come on! Go! Go!

54:09.791 --> 54:10.791
[Audrey] Oh no!

54:11.375 --> 54:13.250
- What are you doing?
- [Nick] Oh God.

54:13.250 --> 54:16.000
Here, take this.
I'm gonna shoot out the window.

54:17.166 --> 54:18.125

54:22.708 --> 54:24.458

No!

The heinous nature of the crimes.

Several murders, a kidnapping,

of the oldest café in Paris,

Because I have them on the phone.

56:27.166 --> 56:29.750
- [Audrey] <i>Hello? Hey. Is everybody there?
-</i> Yes, Audrey.

56:29.750 --> 56:30.791
<i>Everyone except--</i>

56:30.791 --> 56:33.000
The Countess and her creepy little friend?

56:33.000 --> 56:34.916
Give back Vikram, you monsters!

56:34.916 --> 56:37.291
<i>- You already got the money.</i>
- Yes, we do have the money.

56:37.291 --> 56:40.500
<i>And if you ever wanna see it again,
you better tell the kidnapper</i>

56:40.500 --> 56:44.166
to bring the Maharajah
to the Jules Verne restaurant.

56:44.166 --> 56:45.416
What? The what?

56:45.916 --> 56:47.291
[Audrey] <i>Jules Verne restaurant.</i>

56:47.291 --> 56:49.083
Jules Verne restaurant? Ah, Le Ju--

56:49.625 --> 56:51.291
- Le Jules Verne.
- Oh.

56:51.291 --> 56:54.333
On the observation deck
at the Eiffel Tower at midnight.

56:54.333 --> 56:55.250
[Nick] <i>Yes.</i>

56:55.250 --> 56:56.958
What do you mean?
We don't have my brother.

56:56.958 --> 56:59.666
- Bullshit!
- Oh, somebody there does, okay?

56:59.666 --> 57:03.666
So do what my wife just said.
Midnight, Maharajah, alive.

57:03.666 --> 57:06.500
And, Inspector,
we tried to start your car up

57:06.500 --> 57:09.125
but, uh, couldn't get it done,
so we left it there.

57:09.125 --> 57:10.208
What?

57:10.208 --> 57:12.250
We stole a Lamborghini. You can have that

57:12.250 --> 57:13.666
<i>when we're done with it.</i>

57:13.666 --> 57:14.875
Okay.

57:16.791 --> 57:18.708
[dramatic music playing]

57:31.083 --> 57:32.041
[bell dings]

57:38.041 --> 57:40.666
Oh my God. So gorgeous.

57:41.875 --> 57:43.375
Why are you all dressed up?

57:43.375 --> 57:45.666
We read online there was a dress code.

57:45.666 --> 57:48.750
We couldn't get into Tavern on the Green
'cause I was wearing shorts one time.

57:48.750 --> 57:50.208
- Wh-- Where is everybody?
- Yeah.

57:50.208 --> 57:53.083
We bought out the restaurant
so we wouldn't be disturbed.

57:53.083 --> 57:55.416
You do understand
the idea of doing this in public

57:55.416 --> 57:57.416
is so there are actually people around?

57:57.416 --> 58:00.708
- How did you even get these clothes?
- And you got your hair done?

58:00.708 --> 58:02.541
Look, we had a situation, all right?

58:02.541 --> 58:05.875
There was a moat, and then we did...
I don't have to explain myself, okay?

58:05.875 --> 58:08.083
We'll be the ones
who ask the questions. How's that?

58:08.083 --> 58:10.791
- Go ahead. Ask the questions.
- Let's review the suspects, shall we?

58:10.791 --> 58:11.958
[sighs]

58:11.958 --> 58:13.125
Get comfortable.

58:13.125 --> 58:15.750
Let's start with Saira Govindan.

58:15.750 --> 58:16.833
Me?

58:16.833 --> 58:17.916
[Audrey] Mm.

58:17.916 --> 58:19.208
I defended you.

58:20.041 --> 58:21.333
I actually really liked you.

58:21.333 --> 58:24.500
I know you did. We really liked you.
You've been so nice to us.

58:24.500 --> 58:26.125
It's just kind of what we do.

58:26.125 --> 58:28.625
Kidnap my own brother?

58:28.625 --> 58:30.708
- She's getting upset.
- I see. She's in front of me.

58:30.708 --> 58:32.083
Are you out of your mind?

58:32.083 --> 58:34.125
- Just move on. Audrey, move on.
- Moving on.

58:34.125 --> 58:35.166
[Nick] All good, Saira.

58:35.166 --> 58:37.666
[Audrey] Francisco, chairman of the board.

58:38.250 --> 58:42.208
With the Maharajah gone,
you can embezzle all the money you want

58:42.208 --> 58:45.375
to cover all those paternity suits
for your 2,000 children.

58:45.375 --> 58:47.916
I say we make it 2,001, huh?

58:47.916 --> 58:48.958
Get out of my face.

58:48.958 --> 58:50.666
Disgusting pig.

58:50.666 --> 58:52.166
Claudette Joubert.

58:52.166 --> 58:53.250
<i>Joubert.</i>

58:53.250 --> 58:56.041
Parisian shopgirl desperate for money.

58:56.625 --> 58:59.291
If I wanted money,
don't you think I'd just marry him?

58:59.291 --> 59:01.916
Not with that brutal prenup
the board had you sign.

59:03.333 --> 59:05.916
But what about the Colonel?
What's his motive?

59:05.916 --> 59:10.916
Well, maybe he just is sick of working
for rich people 'cause you guys suck.

59:11.666 --> 59:17.500
Or maybe the Colonel needed enough money
to afford himself

59:18.541 --> 59:19.958
a bionic arm.

59:20.583 --> 59:23.458
I looked into it.
They're not very expensive.

59:23.458 --> 59:26.166
- How much are we talking?
- Twenty, thirty K.

59:26.166 --> 59:29.208
That's it? Jeez, maybe I should get
something like that.

59:29.208 --> 59:31.125
You're gonna have to lose an arm for that.

59:31.125 --> 59:32.916
I wasn't talking about for the arm.

59:32.916 --> 59:34.375
[chuckles]

59:35.166 --> 59:38.291
Okay, we went through everybody.

59:39.666 --> 59:40.625
Who did it?

59:40.625 --> 59:42.666
[elevator bell dings]

59:44.291 --> 59:45.541
[shrieks, laughs]

59:45.541 --> 59:47.625
- [all laughing]
- <i>Mon amour!</i>

59:47.625 --> 59:49.416
- Hey, hey, hey.
- [Audrey] Whoa, whoa.

59:50.875 --> 59:53.458
Um, I've been asked to show you all

59:53.458 --> 59:55.041
this sick-ass bomb and shit.

59:55.041 --> 59:56.291
[all gasp]

59:56.291 --> 59:57.666
Oh my God.

59:57.666 --> 1:00:00.166
Enough to blow
this whole damn tower up, G.

1:00:00.166 --> 1:00:05.291
So check it. You gotta put the Benjamins
in the lift and send it to the top floor.

1:00:05.291 --> 1:00:09.208
Once the amount has been chickity-checked,
they'll send down the, uh...

1:00:09.208 --> 1:00:12.166
God, what's it called?
The button blaster thingy? The--

1:00:12.166 --> 1:00:14.208
- The remote detonator?
- Yes, that shit.

1:00:14.208 --> 1:00:17.333
They'll send that back down,
and then we can be outtie.

1:00:17.333 --> 1:00:21.583
And it's a bit of a hurry or something
because, you know...

1:00:21.583 --> 1:00:23.625
- [all] Oh no!
- [Audrey] Oh my God, Nick!

1:00:23.625 --> 1:00:26.875
Nick, Nick, Nick. The money.
You must put it in the elevator.

1:00:26.875 --> 1:00:27.791
- Now!
- Nah.

1:00:27.791 --> 1:00:29.291
- "Nah"?
- What do you mean, "nah"?

1:00:29.291 --> 1:00:32.083
- What are you doing?
- I don't think they'll blow him up.

1:00:32.083 --> 1:00:34.708
Nick, are you really just going
on a hunch right now?

1:00:34.708 --> 1:00:35.791
- Trust me.
- [Vik] Nick!

1:00:35.791 --> 1:00:36.708
Bro-heem!

1:00:36.708 --> 1:00:39.458
No, it's all good in the hood, Maharajah.

1:00:39.458 --> 1:00:42.416
Whoever did this
had some serious training, right?

1:00:42.416 --> 1:00:45.083
'Cause he killed Mr. Lou, a lethal badass.

1:00:45.083 --> 1:00:46.875
We're counting down here, G.

1:00:46.875 --> 1:00:48.375
No, no. Nick, Nick, Nick!

1:00:48.375 --> 1:00:51.625
And we know the kidnapper
had some major hacking skills

1:00:51.625 --> 1:00:53.625
to access that footage
and do the deepfake.

1:00:53.625 --> 1:00:55.083
Come on, Nick!

1:00:55.750 --> 1:00:59.791
He knew exactly where to find
Mr. Lou and Vik backstage at the wedding

1:00:59.791 --> 1:01:02.291
in order to pull off
the elephant switcheroo.

1:01:02.291 --> 1:01:04.250
- But, honey--
- Nick! I'm gonna blow up!

1:01:04.250 --> 1:01:06.000
With all that expertise...

1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:07.875
- God, Nick!
- [rapid beeping]

1:01:07.875 --> 1:01:09.833
...this guy should write a book.

1:01:09.833 --> 1:01:11.666
- Oh my God, Nick!
- [all clamoring]

1:01:11.666 --> 1:01:13.041
[Audrey screams]

1:01:14.166 --> 1:01:16.000
[panting]

1:01:17.500 --> 1:01:19.166
[Vik sighs]

1:01:20.083 --> 1:01:21.375
[moans]

1:01:22.125 --> 1:01:27.416
[sighs] "Thousands of studies have shown
that the kidnapper will do nothing

1:01:27.416 --> 1:01:30.208
to jeopardize
the receiving of the ransom."

1:01:30.208 --> 1:01:35.166
Chapter 9, section 3,
written by Mr. Connor Miller.

1:01:35.750 --> 1:01:37.041
You read the book.

1:01:37.041 --> 1:01:38.958
From cover to cover, sweetheart,
and it sucked.

1:01:38.958 --> 1:01:41.041
You gotta try this. It's so good.

1:01:41.041 --> 1:01:43.125
You just scared the crap out of me.

1:01:43.125 --> 1:01:44.791
- [booming]
- [all screaming]

1:01:50.500 --> 1:01:51.666
[Audrey] What was that?

1:01:53.291 --> 1:01:54.166
What?

1:01:57.166 --> 1:01:58.041
Very impressive.

1:01:58.041 --> 1:02:01.000
How did you get out of that SUV
before it blew up?

1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:02.166
I didn't.

1:02:02.708 --> 1:02:05.500
I climbed into a bomb-proof
titanium chamber in the back seat.

1:02:05.500 --> 1:02:09.541
A public death. What better way
to eliminate himself as a suspect.

1:02:09.541 --> 1:02:13.375
Yeah, yeah. But everything didn't go
according to your plan, did it?

1:02:13.375 --> 1:02:17.125
[Audrey] <i>Your guy had his hand on the case
seconds before a clean getaway.</i>

1:02:17.125 --> 1:02:18.750
[Nick] <i>And boom.</i>

1:02:18.750 --> 1:02:20.958
The greedy ex enters the chat.

1:02:20.958 --> 1:02:24.500
Hmm. $70 million. That's a lot of money,

1:02:24.500 --> 1:02:26.166
even for a countess.

1:02:26.166 --> 1:02:29.750
So she sends Imani over
to hijack the hijackers.

1:02:29.750 --> 1:02:31.541
- Who?
- [both] Imani.

1:02:31.541 --> 1:02:33.666
- [Colonel] Who?
- Iman-- The sidekick to the--

1:02:33.666 --> 1:02:35.833
The Countess's... You know, do the laugh.

1:02:35.833 --> 1:02:36.750
Do I have to?

1:02:36.750 --> 1:02:38.541
- Just knock it out.
- [imitates Imani]

1:02:38.541 --> 1:02:39.833
- Okay.
- Oh.

1:02:39.833 --> 1:02:40.750
Now they know.

1:02:40.750 --> 1:02:42.333
And then she swoops in,

1:02:42.333 --> 1:02:45.916
steals the ransom money
right out from under your nose.

1:02:45.916 --> 1:02:47.416
[laughing]

1:02:47.416 --> 1:02:49.166
- That must have hurt.
- Uh-huh.

1:02:49.166 --> 1:02:52.416
Now, if you had, in fact,
read my book properly,

1:02:52.416 --> 1:02:56.875
you'd remember that revealing the identity
of a heretofore anonymous criminal

1:02:56.875 --> 1:03:01.375
puts all those privy
to that information at risk.

1:03:01.375 --> 1:03:02.750
Which means

1:03:04.375 --> 1:03:06.208
I'm gonna have to kill you all.

1:03:06.708 --> 1:03:09.666
- [all clamoring]
- Oh God! [sobs]

1:03:10.333 --> 1:03:11.500
Gary?

1:03:13.208 --> 1:03:14.416
Who the hell are you?

1:03:15.000 --> 1:03:15.875
I'm Susan.

1:03:18.458 --> 1:03:20.625
- Do you know who this is?
- I have no idea.

1:03:20.625 --> 1:03:25.416
Gary and I met here ten years ago
when I was studying abroad,

1:03:25.416 --> 1:03:28.208
and we promised
that if we still loved each other

1:03:28.208 --> 1:03:30.875
and we hadn't found anyone else,

1:03:30.875 --> 1:03:36.166
that we would meet halfway
up the Eiffel Tower at midnight tonight.

1:03:36.166 --> 1:03:37.958
[poignant music playing]

1:03:37.958 --> 1:03:39.875
And I still love him very much.

1:03:41.416 --> 1:03:43.041
Are any of you Gary?

1:03:45.125 --> 1:03:47.000
Put your hand down, Francisco.

1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:48.458
- [Audrey gasps]
- [Nick grunts]

1:03:48.458 --> 1:03:50.041
- [Audrey] Oh my God!
- [all yelling]

1:03:53.125 --> 1:03:53.958
Whoa!

1:03:53.958 --> 1:03:54.958
Oh God!

1:03:54.958 --> 1:03:56.458
[dramatic music playing]

1:04:00.625 --> 1:04:01.750
Get ready.

1:04:01.750 --> 1:04:03.833
[Delacroix panting]

1:04:05.458 --> 1:04:07.208
It just remains for me to say,

1:04:07.208 --> 1:04:08.666
it's been a pleasure.

1:04:10.750 --> 1:04:12.708
He still has the button blaster thingy!

1:04:16.208 --> 1:04:17.416
[Audrey yells]

1:04:17.416 --> 1:04:19.541
- Audrey!
- [Audrey yelling]

1:04:19.541 --> 1:04:21.708
[tense music playing]

1:04:21.708 --> 1:04:22.750
Oh my God!

1:04:23.416 --> 1:04:25.875
No! This is not what I planned!

1:04:33.416 --> 1:04:34.750
[Audrey yells, pants]

1:04:35.541 --> 1:04:37.666
[groaning]

1:04:39.458 --> 1:04:42.250
There really is no end
to your bad decision-making, is there?

1:04:42.875 --> 1:04:45.083
Nick! I can't believe I'm doing this.

1:04:45.083 --> 1:04:46.666
Take my gun. [groans]

1:04:46.666 --> 1:04:49.750
Wait! You need bullets. In my pocket.

1:04:50.250 --> 1:04:52.416
Oh, you little rascal.

1:04:53.000 --> 1:04:55.291
- You got it in there deep, huh?
- You got it.

1:04:55.291 --> 1:04:56.666
[moans]

1:04:56.666 --> 1:04:59.666
[Nick] Susan, put some pressure
on the inspector's wound.

1:04:59.666 --> 1:05:02.166
Is this like an interactive theater thing?

1:05:09.333 --> 1:05:10.791
[grunts, pants]

1:05:10.791 --> 1:05:12.833
I'm glad my biggest fan
is gonna get to see this.

1:05:12.833 --> 1:05:16.000
Actually, not as much of a fan
as I used to be.

1:05:16.000 --> 1:05:18.416
That's a shame because
I'm about to teach my final lesson...

1:05:18.416 --> 1:05:20.083
[weapons cocking]

1:05:20.083 --> 1:05:22.041
How to blow up the Eiffel Tower
and get away with it.

1:05:22.041 --> 1:05:23.458
You would never do that.

1:05:23.458 --> 1:05:26.416
There's only one thing
I hate more than witnesses,

1:05:26.416 --> 1:05:27.666
and that's the French.

1:05:31.250 --> 1:05:34.583
That door opens,
everyone inside is dead, understand?

1:05:34.583 --> 1:05:36.333
- [elevator bell dings]
- [Audrey] Nick!

1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:39.541
No, Nick! No, no! No, no, no!

1:05:40.333 --> 1:05:42.375
Nick! Oh!

1:05:51.166 --> 1:05:52.083
[Claudette] It's stuck.

1:05:52.083 --> 1:05:54.916
- Get this shit off me. I feel vulnerable!
- The vest is a medium.

1:05:54.916 --> 1:05:56.708
You haven't been
a medium since you were 14!

1:05:56.708 --> 1:05:59.166
Just chill out, please!
Get this vest off me.

1:05:59.166 --> 1:06:00.208
You all right?

1:06:00.208 --> 1:06:02.041
[breathless] I need my vape.

1:06:02.041 --> 1:06:04.125
- Okay.
- [Delacroix] In my pocket there.

1:06:04.125 --> 1:06:05.041
The right pocket.

1:06:05.041 --> 1:06:06.208
- This?
- No, no.

1:06:06.208 --> 1:06:07.750
Oh, no. That's your penis.

1:06:07.750 --> 1:06:09.833
- You got it.
- [Susan] Okay, got it. Got it.

1:06:09.833 --> 1:06:12.416
I don't think this is the best thing
for someone who's been shot,

1:06:12.416 --> 1:06:13.541
but go for it.

1:06:13.541 --> 1:06:15.625
[dramatic music playing]

1:06:27.583 --> 1:06:28.833
Here comes Brooklyn.

1:06:28.833 --> 1:06:30.333
[Nick yells]

1:06:33.833 --> 1:06:34.833

1:06:41.416 --> 1:06:42.416
[all clamoring]

1:06:42.416 --> 1:06:43.708
- It stopped!
- Oh!

1:06:43.708 --> 1:06:44.625
[sighs]

1:06:44.625 --> 1:06:47.875
[all laughing]

1:06:49.291 --> 1:06:50.916
[beeping]

1:06:50.916 --> 1:06:52.500
Oh God!

1:06:52.500 --> 1:06:53.791
[all yelling]

1:06:53.791 --> 1:06:55.833
[intense rock music playing]

1:07:01.125 --> 1:07:02.458
Argh!

1:07:05.041 --> 1:07:07.708
[all yelling]

1:07:07.708 --> 1:07:09.083
Cut that damn thing off!

1:07:09.958 --> 1:07:11.958
[fighting grunts]

1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:16.291
[man screams]

1:07:17.833 --> 1:07:19.583
Step back, or this money goes.

1:07:19.583 --> 1:07:21.041
I don't believe you.

1:07:22.958 --> 1:07:25.166
[Nick screams, grunts]

1:07:34.250 --> 1:07:35.083
Uh-uh.

1:07:35.083 --> 1:07:36.000
[grunts]

1:07:36.541 --> 1:07:39.333
How the hell do you do that
without getting a concussion?

1:07:39.333 --> 1:07:40.708
God's gift!

1:07:41.500 --> 1:07:43.208
He will never blink again.

1:07:43.208 --> 1:07:45.958
- [Audrey] Nick!
- Yeah, we're coming, precious!

1:07:45.958 --> 1:07:47.375
Let me handle this, please.

1:07:48.000 --> 1:07:48.916
Oh!

1:07:48.916 --> 1:07:51.666
Perhaps... a mild concussion.

1:07:59.625 --> 1:08:01.666
- Get the thing off!
- We are all gonna blow up!

1:08:01.666 --> 1:08:02.750
I don't know what to do!

1:08:03.541 --> 1:08:04.916
[Nick] It's all good, babe!

1:08:05.583 --> 1:08:07.666
Nicky Two Guns in the house!

1:08:08.416 --> 1:08:11.125
[slow electronic music playing]

1:08:19.000 --> 1:08:20.000
[music stops]

1:08:21.541 --> 1:08:22.875
Did I hit anything?

1:08:22.875 --> 1:08:24.958
You got the detonator thingy, honey!

1:08:24.958 --> 1:08:26.875
Okay, good! That's what I was aiming for!

1:08:26.875 --> 1:08:28.208
- [powers down]
- [Vik] Ooh!

1:08:31.250 --> 1:08:33.250
[all sighing and laughing]

1:08:33.250 --> 1:08:34.458
Oh, my love.

1:08:34.458 --> 1:08:35.791
[Susan sighs]

1:08:40.250 --> 1:08:42.166
The ring. The rings of love.

1:08:43.500 --> 1:08:47.041
Yes. Okay. We're gonna use the guns
for something else now, aren't we, bro?

1:08:47.041 --> 1:08:49.291
Smacked up your friends pretty good.
You're next.

1:08:49.875 --> 1:08:51.041
What's up? What's up?

1:08:53.458 --> 1:08:54.333
Okay.

1:08:56.541 --> 1:08:58.083
Where you going? Babe!

1:08:58.583 --> 1:08:59.416
Audrey!

1:08:59.416 --> 1:09:00.833
[dramatic music playing]

1:09:07.916 --> 1:09:08.791
Honey!

1:09:08.791 --> 1:09:11.916
It's okay, baby! I got you! Just hang on!

1:09:13.666 --> 1:09:15.625
- [groans]
- [whimpering]

1:09:16.375 --> 1:09:17.291
[Audrey straining]

1:09:21.833 --> 1:09:24.666
I must have missed the chapter
on face-kicking.

1:09:27.083 --> 1:09:28.916
[Audrey screams]

1:09:35.750 --> 1:09:37.333

1:09:39.583 --> 1:09:40.875
[yelling]

1:09:45.875 --> 1:09:47.083
[Audrey] Oh my gosh.

1:09:49.708 --> 1:09:51.833
[grunts] Come here.

1:10:02.416 --> 1:10:04.541
It's time to make it rain, bitch.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:09.291
[yelling] No!

1:10:10.125 --> 1:10:12.250
[Nick laughing]

1:10:12.250 --> 1:10:13.166
Oh!

1:10:16.583 --> 1:10:17.416
[Susan] Oh!

1:10:19.916 --> 1:10:21.125
[Audrey yells]

1:10:24.041 --> 1:10:24.916
Come to me!

1:10:27.083 --> 1:10:28.541
- [Nick] No!
- [Audrey grunts]

1:10:29.708 --> 1:10:31.291
[panting]

1:10:34.875 --> 1:10:36.666
[Audrey] No, no, no. Okay.

1:10:39.583 --> 1:10:40.916
Finish off the others.

1:10:46.750 --> 1:10:48.666
Oh... Okay.

1:11:01.666 --> 1:11:03.833
[helicopter blades whirring]

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:08.041
- [Delacroix] What is that?
- That really killed the vibe.

1:11:10.666 --> 1:11:11.833
[Audrey] Hey, Miller!

1:11:14.916 --> 1:11:16.000
My husband was right.

1:11:16.500 --> 1:11:17.875
Your book sucked.

1:11:19.458 --> 1:11:21.333
She never misses.

1:11:22.083 --> 1:11:23.291
[both groaning]

1:11:23.291 --> 1:11:25.083
I'm so sorry!

1:11:25.083 --> 1:11:27.291
- <i>Now</i> you miss?
- I'm sorry, baby! I'm sorry!

1:11:27.291 --> 1:11:30.333
[screaming] Oh shit!

1:11:30.333 --> 1:11:32.541
Goddamn! Are you aiming for me or him?

1:11:32.541 --> 1:11:34.666
Him, I promise! I promise!

1:11:34.666 --> 1:11:36.541
- Just shoot him. Shoot him!
- Shit!

1:11:36.541 --> 1:11:37.666
- Okay.
- [Nick] Shoot him!

1:11:37.666 --> 1:11:40.166
Uh, I've come to the end of my <i>rope,</i>
you know what I mean?

1:11:40.166 --> 1:11:43.208
My wheels are really turning right now.
They're spinnin', my wheels.

1:11:44.000 --> 1:11:45.083
[gun clicking]

1:11:45.083 --> 1:11:46.750
Oh God. Okay.

1:11:49.041 --> 1:11:49.958
Never misses, huh?

1:11:50.875 --> 1:11:53.375
Not everybody
can be as good as you, I guess.

1:11:59.250 --> 1:12:00.666
Enjoy the ride, Miller.

1:12:00.666 --> 1:12:02.375
- [buzzes]
- [gears whirring]

1:12:15.000 --> 1:12:16.375
Oh my God.

1:12:17.958 --> 1:12:19.041
- [Susan shrieks]
- Get down!

- [screams]
- [exclaims]

1:12:24.750 --> 1:12:25.916
- Oh!
- Jeez!

1:12:29.791 --> 1:12:31.000
[beeping]

1:12:39.208 --> 1:12:40.666
Paris is very weird.

1:12:41.541 --> 1:12:42.666
He's dead this time.

1:12:42.666 --> 1:12:44.750
- He's so dead.
- He is. It's done.

1:12:45.416 --> 1:12:48.083
How did you come up with that plan?
How do you do that?

1:12:48.083 --> 1:12:49.750
- I have no idea--
- You're a genius.

1:12:49.750 --> 1:12:52.583
It just kinda came out.
Like, I just was like, what? My baby!

1:12:52.583 --> 1:12:55.458
You are next-level! I would
never think of anything that good.

1:12:55.458 --> 1:12:58.291
Thank you. I don't know what I did,
and it was so scary.

1:12:59.458 --> 1:13:01.458
- What?
- We're a team now, hmm?

1:13:01.458 --> 1:13:05.291
- No. No. Get him off. Get him off.
- Don't touch her. It's getting her upset.

1:13:05.291 --> 1:13:06.416
- Back up.
- Just back up.

1:13:06.416 --> 1:13:10.166
You did good, but just back up.
Give us room. Thank you.

1:13:10.791 --> 1:13:13.208
- Oh, babe.
- It's all right. I love you, baby.

1:13:13.208 --> 1:13:14.208
That was just...

1:13:14.208 --> 1:13:16.791
It's kind of
a beautiful Paris night besides that.

1:13:17.291 --> 1:13:18.250
Yeah.

1:13:19.208 --> 1:13:21.208
[romantic music playing]

1:13:24.416 --> 1:13:26.583
[applause]

1:13:26.583 --> 1:13:27.666
Yes. Hey!

1:13:27.666 --> 1:13:31.375
- [Colonel] Nick! Audrey!
- Hey! You guys did it again! Oh!

1:13:31.375 --> 1:13:34.916
- Vik, I am so sorry about the money.
- Yes, we apologize.

1:13:34.916 --> 1:13:36.416
It was a lot of money to throw away.

1:13:36.416 --> 1:13:39.083
I think Paris is gonna thank you
from the bottom of their hearts.

1:13:39.083 --> 1:13:42.708
Don't worry about it. Just as long as
none of my peeps got murked, yeah?

1:13:42.708 --> 1:13:44.958
[laughs] Apart from Mr. Lou.

1:13:44.958 --> 1:13:46.875
Oh, yeah, that's true.

1:13:46.875 --> 1:13:49.500
- [laughs]
- Lou who, huh? [laughs]

1:13:49.500 --> 1:13:52.708
Oh no. What happened to you?
Why are you bleeding?

1:13:52.708 --> 1:13:55.250
Oh, no. It's... I'm not. It's henna.

1:13:55.250 --> 1:13:57.291
It must have smeared
in tonight's commotion.

1:13:57.916 --> 1:14:00.750
Oh, thank God. I'm sick.
I can't take one more accident tonight.

1:14:00.750 --> 1:14:02.000
No more blood, please.

1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:05.125
- I swear, I thought it was blood.
- I am exhausted. Aren't you?

1:14:05.125 --> 1:14:06.041
[chuckles]

1:14:06.041 --> 1:14:07.000
[Vik] Yeah.

1:14:08.833 --> 1:14:12.166
- What are you muttering about right now?
- Something doesn't make sense.

1:14:12.166 --> 1:14:14.666
[mysterious music playing]

1:14:15.291 --> 1:14:17.208
I'm sorry. It just doesn't make any sense.

1:14:17.208 --> 1:14:19.041
Saira, I'm so sorry. What...

1:14:19.041 --> 1:14:23.041
Did you just say you smeared your henna
during <i>tonight's</i> commotion?

1:14:23.041 --> 1:14:24.250
That's right.

1:14:25.375 --> 1:14:26.500
That's interesting.

1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.083
[scoffs] Why is that interesting?

1:14:29.083 --> 1:14:30.708
[Nick] Yes, why is that interesting?

1:14:30.708 --> 1:14:35.125
You know, I never saw you
during the welcome dance.

1:14:35.125 --> 1:14:39.125
And then you just kind of showed up
right after the elephant arrived.

1:14:39.125 --> 1:14:40.125
Yeah.

1:14:40.125 --> 1:14:42.333
I was... I was getting a drink. [laughs]

1:14:42.333 --> 1:14:46.458
Honey, I was a hairdresser,
and I know a thing or two about dyes,

1:14:46.458 --> 1:14:48.166
and once henna sets,

1:14:48.916 --> 1:14:50.250
it doesn't smear.

1:14:51.708 --> 1:14:54.666
Sorry. I... I have no idea
what you're talking about.

1:14:55.166 --> 1:14:58.333
That wasn't blood that I saw
on the elephant handler's robe.

1:14:58.333 --> 1:14:59.791
It was henna.

1:14:59.791 --> 1:15:03.625
And it was <i>your</i> henna that never had time
to dry the night of the murder.

1:15:03.625 --> 1:15:05.375
Oh my God!

1:15:05.375 --> 1:15:06.833
The sister did it!

1:15:06.833 --> 1:15:08.708
Oh snap!

1:15:08.708 --> 1:15:12.000
Come on. This is lunacy!
You guys, haven't we done this already?

1:15:12.000 --> 1:15:15.250
I love my brother.
I mean, what reason would I have to--

1:15:15.250 --> 1:15:18.833
Maybe because your parents gave him
the family business,

1:15:18.833 --> 1:15:20.541
even though you're the smart one,

1:15:20.541 --> 1:15:23.625
and he's the Jet Skiing rapper wannabe
with no skill at all?

1:15:24.208 --> 1:15:25.041
No offense.

1:15:25.041 --> 1:15:26.333
Some taken.

1:15:26.333 --> 1:15:29.833
And isn't that the same reason
you tried to kill him in Mumbai?

1:15:30.416 --> 1:15:31.375
You!

1:15:32.541 --> 1:15:34.916
Well, my parents
were right about one thing.

1:15:35.958 --> 1:15:37.833
If you need something done correctly,

1:15:38.625 --> 1:15:40.375
you should just do it yourself.

1:15:41.416 --> 1:15:42.333
[screaming]

1:15:42.333 --> 1:15:43.666
- [Vik] Saira!
- [Audrey gasps]

1:15:43.666 --> 1:15:45.041
[Colonel] No!

1:15:46.041 --> 1:15:48.625
Oh! This poor guy, honey!
He's running out of arms!

1:15:50.083 --> 1:15:50.958
Whoa!

1:15:51.541 --> 1:15:52.583
Not in my town.

1:15:52.583 --> 1:15:54.916
Yeah! That's my bae!

1:15:54.916 --> 1:15:56.375
[sighs] Thank you, baby.

1:15:56.375 --> 1:15:57.708
I've got to just...

1:15:58.291 --> 1:16:00.750
- 'Sup! It's okay. Yeah.
- [Colonel groans]

1:16:00.750 --> 1:16:04.125
You... You did great, pal.
You're my number one bodyguard.

1:16:04.125 --> 1:16:06.166
And not just 'cause
the last one got smoked.

1:16:06.166 --> 1:16:09.125
That Kwanzaa bonus
better be off the hook this year.

1:16:09.125 --> 1:16:12.625
Hey, it's bionic arm time, bitch! Yeah?

1:16:12.625 --> 1:16:13.875
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

1:16:13.875 --> 1:16:14.791
[both laugh]

1:16:15.541 --> 1:16:16.541
[Susan] You're okay.

1:16:17.416 --> 1:16:19.625
- How are you feeling, young man?
- How are you doing?

1:16:19.625 --> 1:16:22.625
- I'm okay.
- Laurent is a special man. Aren't you?

1:16:22.625 --> 1:16:25.041
We're gonna go to dinner
once you get out of the hospital.

1:16:25.041 --> 1:16:26.208
Ah!

1:16:26.208 --> 1:16:29.041
Paris weaves its spell once again.

1:16:29.041 --> 1:16:30.291
Feel better.

1:16:30.291 --> 1:16:32.250
- All right.
- [Vik] Should we tell them?

1:16:32.250 --> 1:16:36.125
- Yes! [laughs]
- Okay, guys. We decided to elope.

1:16:36.125 --> 1:16:38.833
- That is the smart choice, always.
- That's amazing.

1:16:38.833 --> 1:16:39.791
Good for you guys.

1:16:39.791 --> 1:16:42.000
Yeah, no family, but, um,

1:16:42.625 --> 1:16:43.875
I owe you guys my life.

Sorry about your sister

Ah, don't worry about it.
She's a real piece of shit.

1:17:09.125 --> 1:17:10.916
We have to do one thing first.

1:17:11.750 --> 1:17:14.625
- Trust me. Trust me. All right?

Now we are forever locked up together
