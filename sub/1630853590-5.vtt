Announcer: <i>
Come on down to Li'l Judy's.</i>

00:08.573 --> 00:10.575
Young Woman: <i>Order up!</i> <i>
Chick chunks!</i>

00:10.619 --> 00:13.013
<i>Raw, juicy,</i> <i>
and ready for the greaser!</i>

00:13.056 --> 00:14.188
Li'l Judy:

00:14.231 --> 00:16.668
<i>You buy it, you fry it!</i>

00:16.712 --> 00:18.322
Boy: <i>C-C-Crispy!</i>

00:18.366 --> 00:22.848
<i>Breakfast all day long,</i> <i>
even after the bars close.</i>

00:22.892 --> 00:25.199
So many memories.

00:25.242 --> 00:27.070
You know, I wasn't just
the mascot.

00:27.114 --> 00:30.073
After school, I'd hitch a ride
over there and play for hours.

00:30.117 --> 00:32.380
Sometimes I'd even
pull a shift,

00:32.423 --> 00:34.730
flipping burgers,
rousting hobos.

00:34.773 --> 00:36.514
And cue
nostalgia spiral.

00:36.558 --> 00:39.604
Remember when
you could roust a hobo?

00:39.648 --> 00:41.345
It wa-- It was never
okay to do that.

00:41.389 --> 00:43.782
Shame we shut 'em all down
long ago.

00:43.826 --> 00:46.263
We didn't.
That's why I called you here.

00:46.307 --> 00:48.178
- Oh, boy.
- In the past week,

00:48.222 --> 00:50.746
12 Li'l J franchises
have been vandalized.

00:50.789 --> 00:53.575
Oh, my God.
It's beyond repair.

00:53.618 --> 00:57.057
Uh, this one was actually
remodeled recently.

00:57.100 --> 00:59.102
Here we go.
Our South Assburg store.

00:59.146 --> 01:02.236
A masked delinquent has been
defacing Li'l Judy's face

01:02.279 --> 01:05.369
and leaving this tag,
"KK."

01:05.413 --> 01:07.719
We think that stands for
Kaptain Khaos.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.373
Problem isn't
the vandalism.

01:09.417 --> 01:12.115
It's the spelling.
'Cause K for C is a '90s trope.

01:12.159 --> 01:13.943
It's the news coverage.

01:13.986 --> 01:17.251
It's drawing unwanted attention
to the fact that Li'l Judy's

01:17.294 --> 01:20.428
are more rundown than
a shitter on shitty Tuesday.

01:20.471 --> 01:24.823
I was thinking this might be
a job for your friend.

01:24.867 --> 01:26.956
Oh, Mackenzie
from pilates.

01:26.999 --> 01:27.957
No.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.394
Ah, right --
Birdgirl.

01:30.438 --> 01:32.918
Let me Mackenzie know anyway.
We may need backup.

We're live in East Assburg,

03:09.363 --> 03:11.016
where the masked delinquent
has struck

03:11.060 --> 03:12.931
yet another Li'l Judy's.

03:12.975 --> 03:15.195
How would you describe
the assailant?

03:15.238 --> 03:17.197
Uh, there was quite a bit
of grease smoke,

03:17.240 --> 03:18.546
but if I had to
put a name to it,

03:18.589 --> 03:20.200
he was half Zorro,

03:20.243 --> 03:22.680
half that slurring
Disney pirate, and, uh --

03:22.724 --> 03:24.856
100% hunk.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.075
Mackenzie.

03:26.118 --> 03:28.251
We do a pilates class together.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.254
Is it true you sketched an image
of the perpetrator

03:31.298 --> 03:33.256
who calls himself
Kaptain Khaos?

03:33.300 --> 03:36.390
I dabble.

03:36.433 --> 03:38.740
I have a message for you,
Kaptain Khaos.

03:38.783 --> 03:42.265
When I catch you, oh,
the things I will do to you.

03:42.309 --> 03:46.226
And I am prepared -- nay,
lying fully prone in wait --

03:46.269 --> 03:48.532
for whatever you may
have planned for me.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.230
Ohh.

03:50.273 --> 03:52.449
And back to you, Sandra.

03:52.493 --> 03:55.539
I pulled a print.
Size 12, Pronater.

03:55.583 --> 03:57.106
Probably ran
cross-country.

03:57.149 --> 03:58.586
Luckily,
I got a littermate

03:58.629 --> 04:01.893
works security at 23 and Me,
owes me one.

04:01.937 --> 04:04.287
We should have results
in three to six months.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.116
This job's all about
relationships, kids.

04:07.159 --> 04:09.727
Or I just rant the footage
through FaceMatch

04:09.771 --> 04:13.905
and found all his socials
and his WikiFeet page.

04:13.949 --> 04:15.907
There's one for men now?
Huh.

04:15.951 --> 04:17.605
Ew! They're all barefoot.

04:17.648 --> 04:18.780
Enhance.

04:18.823 --> 04:20.390
This isn't
voice-activated.

04:20.434 --> 04:22.305
I know. Enhance.

04:22.349 --> 04:26.004
"Kaptain Khaos fancies himself
as an anti-corporate vigilante.

04:26.048 --> 04:28.311
His goal is to take down
capitalist America

04:28.355 --> 04:30.705
and to
'kill the rich.'"

04:32.315 --> 04:34.143
Ooh, that must
harsh your buzz a bit.

04:34.186 --> 04:35.753
<i>Dook one for the people!</i>

04:35.797 --> 04:38.147
Ugh! what's the opposite
of "enhance"?

04:38.190 --> 04:40.105
<i>Take that, Li'l Shitty.</i>

04:40.149 --> 04:41.672
Just another "brocialist."

04:41.716 --> 04:43.587
Only know what they're against,
no clue what they're for.

04:43.631 --> 04:45.023
Give it a week,
and he'll jump to

04:45.067 --> 04:47.939
the next trendy cause,
like canine intactiveism.

04:47.983 --> 04:49.811
Oh.
Sorry.

04:49.854 --> 04:51.595
I don't know, guys.

04:51.639 --> 04:53.945
Something about him
feels true.

04:53.989 --> 04:55.469
Watch out.

04:55.512 --> 04:57.166
"True" is
Birdgirl's kink.

04:57.209 --> 04:58.950
And, apparently,
dirty feet?

04:58.994 --> 05:00.604
It's not like that.

05:00.648 --> 05:02.345
Sure, he's not
a great speller,

05:02.389 --> 05:04.826
and he's rough around the edges
and clearly all man.

05:04.869 --> 05:08.003
But you don't don a mask and
commit third-degree vandalism

05:08.046 --> 05:10.484
unless you've got
something loud to say.

05:10.527 --> 05:13.487
I mean, he is all-in.

05:15.924 --> 05:17.534
We've gotta stop him
from trending.

05:17.578 --> 05:19.797
He trends,
Li'l Judy's trends.

05:19.841 --> 05:22.322
Li'l Judy's trends, people
realize they're still open.

05:22.365 --> 05:24.193
Let's neutralize the kook.

05:24.236 --> 05:26.369
When you say
"neutralize"...

05:26.413 --> 05:28.893
There's some things
it's better you not know.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.242
Like queening.

05:30.286 --> 05:32.549
He's got that
"it" factor.

05:32.593 --> 05:34.203
Like a young Chevy Chase.

05:34.246 --> 05:36.248
We have to
engage with him.

05:36.292 --> 05:39.382
Connect -- inches from his face
and body.

05:39.426 --> 05:41.079
That's not
a touchscreen.

05:41.123 --> 05:42.690
How do we get to him?

05:42.733 --> 05:44.996
He always codes in
geocoordinates for his next hit

05:45.040 --> 05:46.824
on his page
for his followers.

05:46.868 --> 05:50.001
Looks like he'll be downtown tonight.

05:50.045 --> 05:52.482
And our friend
will be waiting.

05:52.526 --> 05:54.354
And this time,
she'll nail him.

05:54.397 --> 05:56.834
Mackenzie?
Yeah, she'll totally nail him.

05:56.878 --> 05:58.488
Calm down.

05:58.532 --> 06:01.361
Mm.

06:01.404 --> 06:04.668
You sure sending Birdgirl after
that clod is a good idea?

06:04.712 --> 06:06.104
He's so her type.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.019
Ew! Gross!

06:08.063 --> 06:09.891
Birdgirl might be into
that cootie bag,

06:09.934 --> 06:11.371
but Judy isn't.

06:11.414 --> 06:14.025
Judy isn't into anyone.
We've established that.

06:14.069 --> 06:18.029
But Birdgirl, however,
is seemingly into everyone.

06:18.073 --> 06:20.205
Let's see. There was the
masked guy with the metal suit.

06:20.249 --> 06:22.120
Or the other guy with
the other metal suit.

06:22.164 --> 06:24.862
Then the other masked guy, then
the masked guy from Chicago.

06:24.906 --> 06:27.691
He ate deepdish?
That he did.

06:27.735 --> 06:29.040
And every one of them,

06:29.084 --> 06:31.391
Birdgirl was duty-bound
to bring down.

06:31.434 --> 06:32.870
Literally.

06:32.914 --> 06:35.307
Okay, okay.
So Birdgirl has a bad picker.

06:35.351 --> 06:37.048
But don't forget --
Birdgirl works for me,

06:37.092 --> 06:38.223
not the other way around.

06:38.267 --> 06:40.051
Judy's <i>der bosserschnitzel,</i>

06:40.095 --> 06:43.141

06:45.143 --> 06:46.797

06:46.841 --> 06:48.799
condescend to Birdgirl

I've been watching you, Birdgirl.

11:09.364 --> 11:11.192
When I saw you working to
destroy the company

from the inside, I knew
we'd make the perfect team.

capitalism's handmaiden --
Judy Ken Sebben.

11:27.861 --> 11:29.384
Her?
Really?

11:29.427 --> 11:32.909
I mean...yeah, she has
horrible taste in pillows,

11:32.953 --> 11:34.345
she doesn't shave
above the knee,

11:34.389 --> 11:37.435
but is she really
the worst offender?

11:37.479 --> 11:40.700
Huh. You seem to really know
a lot about her.

11:40.743 --> 11:41.744
Oh.

11:41.788 --> 11:43.267
The devil, when she comes,

11:43.311 --> 11:44.747
won't shave
above the knee.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.010
Ugh. That was taken
out of context.

11:47.054 --> 11:48.533
Ugh.
Just look at her.

11:48.577 --> 11:51.058
But she's trying to
change the company.

11:51.101 --> 11:52.363
Can I trust you?

11:52.407 --> 11:54.191

take a bad picture.

12:07.422 --> 12:09.032
No, really.

12:09.076 --> 12:11.252
Scientists are mystified.

12:15.909 --> 12:18.563
- Aah!
- So, this is what the flight of shame looks like.

12:18.607 --> 12:20.957
I assume you paired it with
a trip to Denny's.

12:21.001 --> 12:23.873
- Aah!
- So, how'd the mission go?

12:23.917 --> 12:24.961
We heard everything.

12:25.005 --> 12:26.876
Everything.

12:26.920 --> 12:30.314
Uh... And it turns out you do know
what queening means.

12:30.358 --> 12:32.969
You let Birdgirl's carpet
run Judy's drapes.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.928
And now
he's in the building.

12:34.971 --> 12:36.233
We gotta eliminate him.

12:36.277 --> 12:37.408
You're right.

12:37.452 --> 12:38.888
I destroyed
Judy's apartment,

12:38.932 --> 12:41.282
carpet, drapes,
and crown molding.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.284
- Crown molding?
- Bazooms.

12:43.327 --> 12:45.286
Birdgirl got us
into this mess,

12:45.329 --> 12:47.592
so now Judy's gotta
get us out of it.

12:47.636 --> 12:49.464
Her way.

12:51.031 --> 12:52.597
Hey, Denise!

12:52.641 --> 12:55.165
Jessica,
eczema's looking sharp.

12:55.209 --> 12:57.080
Hugh, tell Cheryl
happy birthday.

12:57.124 --> 12:58.952

12:58.995 --> 13:01.606
Cheryl's 8.

13:01.650 --> 13:03.652
Judy, I'd like you to meet
my new executive intern.

13:03.695 --> 13:05.306
Not now, Paul.
I'm looking for --

13:05.349 --> 13:06.960
No, no, no, no, no.

13:07.003 --> 13:09.266
Oh. Hi, there.
I'm Ed Todd.

13:09.310 --> 13:10.790
What happened to you?

13:10.833 --> 13:11.791
I'm sorry?

13:11.834 --> 13:13.096
Do not blow this for me.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.490
He is a genius at
stacking those cards.

13:15.533 --> 13:17.797
Nice to meet you
for the first time ever.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.102
How about a tour?

13:19.146 --> 13:20.451
I always give new hires
some one-on-one.

13:20.495 --> 13:21.670
It's just who we are.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.454
As the CEO,
we put the people first.

13:23.498 --> 13:24.847
We! Me!

13:24.891 --> 13:27.110
I'm gonna need him back
for inventory!

13:27.154 --> 13:29.199
God,
that man has a great ass.

13:29.243 --> 13:31.680
Two halves of
the same hairy peach.

13:31.723 --> 13:32.942
Since I took the reins,

13:32.986 --> 13:34.944
I've really revolutionized
the company.

13:34.988 --> 13:37.860
We put out not one but two
products for mental health

13:37.904 --> 13:39.731
that backfired miserably,

13:39.775 --> 13:42.299
and I redesigned
the Popple can

13:42.343 --> 13:44.301
for the differently handed.

13:44.345 --> 13:46.869
Pissed a lot of
big-hand types off.

13:46.913 --> 13:50.742
Ahh, the price of being a
capitalist activist do-goodnik.

13:50.786 --> 13:52.309
Hi, boss.

13:52.353 --> 13:53.658
We just wanted
to thank you

13:53.702 --> 13:55.486
for letting us work here
another year.

13:55.530 --> 13:58.533
You're the best boss,
and we know you really care.

14:00.361 --> 14:02.493
- Was that...a child?
- It was.

14:02.537 --> 14:04.234
As you can see,

14:04.278 --> 14:06.410
we are leading the way on
sustainable corporate culture.

14:06.454 --> 14:08.195
We made the executive decision
to switch

14:08.238 --> 14:11.851
from single-use cups
to not...

14:11.894 --> 14:13.765
single-use.

14:13.809 --> 14:16.594
Um...what's in there?

14:16.638 --> 14:18.161
Nothing exciting.

14:18.205 --> 14:19.684
Hey!
It's nearly 10:00 am.

14:19.728 --> 14:20.990
Hibachi for lunch?

14:21.034 --> 14:22.905
Is it okay if I use
my own utensils?

14:22.949 --> 14:23.993
I know they're clean.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.996
<i>Irasshaimase.</i>

14:27.040 --> 14:28.911
How many other corporations offer

14:28.955 --> 14:30.782
on-campus cuisines
of the world?

14:30.826 --> 14:33.873
One reason Sebben & Sebben
is number 3,428

14:33.916 --> 14:35.526
on the list of
best places to work.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.267
- Get away.
- Okay.

14:37.311 --> 14:38.747
Oh.

14:38.790 --> 14:41.228
You've hardly touched
your onion volcano.

14:41.271 --> 14:42.882
Not enough steam?

14:42.925 --> 14:45.188
Did you read the piece in <i>EcoWar</i>
about factory fishing?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.582
What happened to you?

14:47.625 --> 14:49.758
Uh, I thought
you loved hibachi?

14:49.801 --> 14:52.021
Why would you...
think that?

14:52.065 --> 14:53.370
<i>Itadakimasu.</i>

14:53.414 --> 14:55.546
I think it was mentioned
on your --

14:55.590 --> 14:59.115
mention of yourself
t-o-o-o me.

15:03.946 --> 15:05.121
Mmm.

15:05.165 --> 15:07.645
We eat
the floor shrimp.

15:07.689 --> 15:09.778
We are
zero waste here.

15:09.821 --> 15:11.649
- Get away.
- Okay.

15:11.693 --> 15:13.477
<i>Arigatougozaimasu.</i>

15:15.610 --> 15:17.568
How do you
stand this guy?!

15:17.612 --> 15:20.397
He's so judgy
and self-righteous.

15:20.441 --> 15:22.312
You're trying
way too hard.

15:22.356 --> 15:23.444
It's embarrassing.

15:23.487 --> 15:25.228
Why can't you
just be cool?

15:25.272 --> 15:27.143
Your boyfriend
wants us dead.

15:27.187 --> 15:28.579
He wants <i>you</i> dead.

15:28.623 --> 15:30.625
He's pretty happy where we are
as a couple.

15:30.668 --> 15:32.583
He told me so.
After sex.

15:32.627 --> 15:34.977
I am you,
and you are me!

15:35.021 --> 15:37.066
Judy,
I'm starting to think

15:37.110 --> 15:38.938
that the only thing
we have in common

15:38.981 --> 15:40.591
is that we're
the same person.

15:40.635 --> 15:43.943
You got us into this mess
with your own untamable libido.

15:43.986 --> 15:46.946
I won't apologize
for my carnality.

15:46.989 --> 15:48.599
Maybe he's right.

15:48.643 --> 15:51.254
Maybe the only way to change
the system is to destroy it.

15:51.298 --> 15:52.603
That's it!

15:52.647 --> 15:55.128
O-w-w-w.

15:57.478 --> 15:58.827
You, come with me.

15:58.870 --> 16:00.611
Don't you dare
make me call

16:00.655 --> 16:03.092
my nonexistent
H.R. department!

16:03.136 --> 16:04.615
You think Sebben & Sebben
is evil

16:04.659 --> 16:06.008
and I'm a blight
on humanity?

16:06.052 --> 16:08.358
Well, bub, you don't know
the half of it.

16:08.402 --> 16:10.012
You want to know
what's behind that door?

16:10.056 --> 16:12.972
All the horrific things
this company has done.

16:13.015 --> 16:16.105
Before my tenure and...during.

16:16.149 --> 16:18.803
The mother lode.
Why are you showing me this?

16:18.847 --> 16:20.675
How do you think I felt
when I inherited this?

16:20.718 --> 16:21.981
Pretty gutted.

16:22.024 --> 16:23.634
But then,
I realized something.

16:23.678 --> 16:25.375
I could give up
and give in

16:25.419 --> 16:28.988
and just say the company sucks,
so let's burn it all down,

16:29.031 --> 16:32.382
or I could work to clean up
the mess we've made,

16:32.426 --> 16:34.994
ever day,
a little bit at a time.

16:35.037 --> 16:36.734
It's easy to judge
from the outside,

16:36.778 --> 16:41.000
so I'm showing you
our insides.

16:41.043 --> 16:45.134
Your sanitizer,
it's coming loose.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.570
Let it fall.

16:48.181 --> 16:50.009
<i>I wasn't exactly</i> <i>
planning on this,</i>

16:50.052 --> 16:52.011
<i>which may serve</i> <i>
as an explanation</i>

16:52.054 --> 16:56.537
<i>for my somewhat retro</i> <i>
grooming situation down there.</i>

16:56.580 --> 16:59.105
Don't transcribe that.

17:01.063 --> 17:03.500
Come and get me,
hell girl.

17:03.544 --> 17:04.675
I dare you.

17:04.719 --> 17:07.200
Devil Judy:

17:10.551 --> 17:13.336
Va-va-va-voom.

17:19.386 --> 17:22.432
Dear God,
the grotesquerie.

17:22.476 --> 17:25.348
Good God, it's been six minutes
and it's still not in.

17:25.392 --> 17:26.567
Oh, they're done.

17:26.610 --> 17:27.872
Does anybody
have eyes on him?

17:27.916 --> 17:29.222
He's still upstairs.

17:29.265 --> 17:31.528
I put a tracker
in his hand sanitizer.

17:31.572 --> 17:34.401
The other half
of the hairy peach.

17:34.444 --> 17:36.272
Captured --
with a K.

17:36.316 --> 17:38.622
Oh, God!

17:38.666 --> 17:41.712
You don't own me,
you tiny pervert!

17:41.756 --> 17:43.801
Unh! Unh!

17:43.845 --> 17:46.108
No, no, no!

17:52.114 --> 17:53.550
It's over.

17:58.164 --> 18:01.080
I guess it's a cheat day
for ol' B-O-B.

18:02.255 --> 18:03.560
Excuse me, sir.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.127
Aren't you gonna
file a report?

18:05.171 --> 18:08.304
No.
I no longer file reports.

18:08.348 --> 18:10.089
I'm moving on
with my life.

18:10.132 --> 18:12.221
Va-va-va-voom.

18:14.484 --> 18:17.096
Been dying to see you
all day.

18:17.139 --> 18:19.228
I was wrong about
Judy Ken Sebben.

18:19.272 --> 18:21.752
See?
I told you she's trying.

18:21.796 --> 18:24.799
No. Actually, it's worse than we
could've possibly even imagined.

18:24.842 --> 18:27.106
She's nothing.
A powerless figurehead.

18:27.149 --> 18:28.672
Spends her days
touring interns around

18:28.716 --> 18:30.239
while her team does
all the work.

18:30.283 --> 18:33.155
These are the real masterminds
behind the operation.

18:33.199 --> 18:34.678
Oh, boy.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.638
If we eradicate them,
it's just a matter of time

18:37.681 --> 18:39.248
before Judy
drives Sebben & Sebben

18:39.292 --> 18:40.597
into the ground on her own

18:40.641 --> 18:43.818
while we stand by
and watch it burn.

18:48.039 --> 18:50.172
What's wrong,
Birdgirl?

18:50.216 --> 18:51.695
Ahh.

18:51.739 --> 18:54.176
Judy, in the name of
all that doesn't reek

18:54.220 --> 18:56.700
of sensitively cured meats,
stop him!

18:56.744 --> 18:58.659
If only you could
smell his musk,

18:58.702 --> 19:00.269
you would understand.

19:00.313 --> 19:01.792
Boy-oop!

19:01.836 --> 19:04.534
Okay, I guess
my reckless dating decisions

19:04.578 --> 19:06.884
have put my friends
in mortal danger.

19:06.928 --> 19:08.147
Multiple times.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.539
Oh, the deepdish guy.

19:09.583 --> 19:11.628
Thank you
for not making me say it.

19:11.672 --> 19:13.674
And today's the day
I grow up and say,

19:13.717 --> 19:17.199
"I choose my friendships
over my crazy-ass libido."

19:17.243 --> 19:20.289
How about 80% friends,
20% booty?

19:20.333 --> 19:22.639
I'll do it!
We both will.

19:22.683 --> 19:25.338
The one thing that
makes us unstoppable is...

19:25.381 --> 19:27.905
Both:
...we are the same person.

19:27.949 --> 19:29.516
Hi, Judy.

19:31.082 --> 19:33.346
You knew?
When?

19:33.389 --> 19:35.391
I knew the whole time.

19:35.435 --> 19:38.699
Oh, and by the way,
you smell like shrimp.

19:38.742 --> 19:40.657
Damn floor shrimp.

19:40.701 --> 19:42.920
Fine.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.748
Maybe it's time to say
what we're all thinking.

19:44.792 --> 19:47.360
"Kaptain Khaos"
is a ridiculous name.

19:47.403 --> 19:49.710
"Chaos"
is spelled with a C-H.

19:51.059 --> 19:53.583
And despite
what you may think,

19:53.627 --> 19:56.760
I'm damn proud of
what I've accomplished

19:56.804 --> 20:01.678
with these fine
bound and gagged people.

20:01.722 --> 20:05.378
Paul: Will you shut up?
We're about to be flash-fried!

20:05.421 --> 20:08.207
This corporation
you love so much,

20:08.250 --> 20:10.034
do you know the damage
it causes?

20:10.078 --> 20:11.514
Can you show us
in a flashback?

20:11.558 --> 20:14.604
Do love a flashback.
Boy-oop!

20:14.648 --> 20:16.258
Kaptain Khaos:
It was my 8th birthday.

20:16.302 --> 20:18.347
Welcome to Li'l Judy's!

20:18.391 --> 20:20.219
Before we welcome you
to Li'l Judy's,

20:20.262 --> 20:23.700
please sign this contract
for 16 monthly payments

20:23.744 --> 20:26.529
and these waivers indemnifying
Sebben & Sebben

20:26.573 --> 20:28.575
from any responsibility.

20:28.618 --> 20:29.793
Now have some fun!

20:29.837 --> 20:32.143
I deep-fried everything --

20:32.187 --> 20:35.408
nuggets, burgers,
the car keys.

20:35.451 --> 20:37.627
I must have
overloaded the system

20:37.671 --> 20:40.935
because the entire place
exploded into flames.

20:40.978 --> 20:43.154
And it killed my parents.

20:43.198 --> 20:46.070
It's all my fault!

20:46.114 --> 20:48.159
It's not your fault, Eddie.

20:48.203 --> 20:50.466
Li'l Judy?
Is it really you?

20:50.510 --> 20:52.076
No, it's not.

20:52.120 --> 20:53.600
It's our fault,

20:53.643 --> 20:56.646
and it's time for us
to come clean.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.082
What are you doing?

20:58.126 --> 21:02.913
A very special quiet meal
for the birthday boy!

21:02.957 --> 21:04.915
She's not
admitting culpability!

21:04.959 --> 21:06.265
He signed a waiver!

21:06.308 --> 21:07.962
Plus, he had some fun!

21:08.005 --> 21:10.269
Take it
and do good with it.

21:10.312 --> 21:13.446
And now
you give me the button.

21:13.489 --> 21:15.143
Are you insane?!

21:15.186 --> 21:17.841
You'll ruin us!

21:29.636 --> 21:31.551
She's gonna blow!

21:33.335 --> 21:34.597
Don't worry.

21:34.641 --> 21:35.946
I'll be okay.

21:35.990 --> 21:37.644
It's with a K.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.472
Sometimes other letters.

21:43.214 --> 21:46.130
Making that pirate clown
think you were giving him

21:46.174 --> 21:49.482
all our secrets, and then
turning the tables on him?

21:49.525 --> 21:51.048
Genius!

21:51.092 --> 21:54.356
All that incriminating evidence
up in smoke.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.792
I had my doubts about you,

21:55.836 --> 21:58.317
but you're not afraid
to get bloody.

21:58.360 --> 22:00.231
- Judy: Enhance.
- You might turn out to be

22:00.275 --> 22:02.799
the best CEO
this company's ever had.

22:02.843 --> 22:06.063
Uh...not including Phil,
of course.
