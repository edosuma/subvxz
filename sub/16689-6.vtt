WEBVTT

00:02.269 --> 00:04.004
TONIGHT
ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES,

00:04.037 --> 00:05.205
GORDON GOES TO LOS ANGELES.

00:05.239 --> 00:08.175
AND DISCOVERS A PIZZERIA
ON ITS LAST LEGS.

00:08.208 --> 00:09.977
IN MOVIE TERMS,

00:10.010 --> 00:11.912
YOU'VE GONE STRAIGHT TO DVD.

00:11.945 --> 00:14.214
GORDON HAS ONE WEEK
TO TAKE THIS RESTAURANT

00:14.248 --> 00:15.916
FROM TWO THUMBS DOWN...

00:15.949 --> 00:17.918
HERE WE GO.
CUE ACTION, DRAMA.

00:17.951 --> 00:20.287
TO A BOX OFFICE SMASH.

00:20.320 --> 00:22.456
BUT WITH A BOSS
WHO'S IN LA LA LAND,

00:22.489 --> 00:24.925
MY PIZZAS WILL BE
IN SUPERMARKETS.

00:24.958 --> 00:27.127
WHAT?
SEBASTIAN'S
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

00:27.160 --> 00:28.729
OH, MY GOD.

00:28.762 --> 00:30.000
AND A SPACED OUT MENU,

00:30.000 --> 00:30.163
AND A SPACED OUT MENU,

00:30.197 --> 00:31.632
WE HAVE A CONCEPT.

00:31.665 --> 00:33.700
WHAT WE HAVE
IS 20 DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS.

00:33.734 --> 00:36.136
THIS MAY BE
HIS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE YET.

00:36.169 --> 00:37.371
THAT GUY NEEDS THERAPY.

00:37.404 --> 00:38.906
I'M A DAMN GOOD COOK.

00:38.939 --> 00:40.107
AND WHEN THE OWNER FLIPS OUT,

00:40.140 --> 00:41.275
THIS IS MY  LIFE.

00:41.308 --> 00:42.342
WE'RE DONE.

00:42.376 --> 00:43.877
GET THE CAMERA
OUTTA HERE.

00:43.911 --> 00:45.345
AND BREAKS ALL THE RULES,

00:45.379 --> 00:47.281
HE JUST CHANGED
LIKE DR. JEKYLL TO MR. HYDE.

00:47.314 --> 00:49.383
GORDON GIVES HIM A COLD REVIEW.

00:49.416 --> 00:53.687
I'VE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER

00:53.720 --> 00:57.057
MET SOMEONE I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

00:57.090 --> 01:00.000
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.294
TONIGHT ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

01:03.330 --> 01:11.271
*

01:18.679 --> 01:20.948
BURBANK, CALIFORNIA.

01:20.981 --> 01:23.584
HOME TO MAJOR HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS

01:23.617 --> 01:26.019
WHOSE EMPLOYEES ENJOY
DINING AND MAKING DEALS

01:26.053 --> 01:27.254
AT THE LOCAL RESTAURANTS.

01:27.287 --> 01:28.989
BUT THERE'S ONE RESTAURANT

01:29.022 --> 01:30.000
THAT IS NOT BENEFITING
FROM THIS LOCATION.

01:30.000 --> 01:31.224
THAT IS NOT BENEFITING
FROM THIS LOCATION.

01:31.258 --> 01:32.993
AND IT'S IN FINANCIAL HELL.

01:33.026 --> 01:36.263
IT'S A NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZERIA
CALLED SEBASTIAN'S,

01:36.296 --> 01:39.633
NAMED AFTER ITS OWNER,
WHO IS ALSO A PART TIME ACTOR.

01:39.666 --> 01:42.269
AND WHO'S ABOUT TO RECEIVE
MUCH-NEEDED HELP

01:42.302 --> 01:45.472
FROM GORDON RAMSAY.

01:45.505 --> 01:47.140
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING?
GOOD.

01:47.174 --> 01:48.241
I'VE OWNED THE RESTAURANT

01:48.275 --> 01:49.076
FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS.

01:49.109 --> 01:50.177
I CAN COOK ANYTHING.

01:50.210 --> 01:51.945
AY, THAT'S A SANDWICH.

01:51.979 --> 01:53.981
AND MY MOTHER'S BEEN TEACHING ME
SINCE I COULD WALK,

01:54.014 --> 01:55.816
SO I GUESS
THAT'S MY FORMAL TRAINING.

01:55.849 --> 01:57.584
MY ABILITY IS ENDLESS.

01:57.618 --> 02:00.000
PUT IT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I'LL MAKE THE DISH FOR YOU.

02:00.000 --> 02:00.520
PUT IT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I'LL MAKE THE DISH FOR YOU.

02:00.554 --> 02:03.357
I'LL EAT IT MYSELF.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.392
I THINK I'M VERY POLITE
TO MY STAFF.

02:05.425 --> 02:06.460
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

02:06.493 --> 02:07.427
TREAT 'EM GREAT.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.695
LOU!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.197
I'M VERY UNDERSTANDING,
I THINK.

02:10.230 --> 02:11.898
THIS IS FILTHY.

02:11.932 --> 02:13.266
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

02:13.300 --> 02:14.701
WHEN HE GETS UPSET,
YOU MIGHT SEE

02:14.735 --> 02:17.337
PANS FLYING ACROSS THE KITCHEN.

02:17.371 --> 02:19.072
BETTER DUCK.
THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY.

02:19.106 --> 02:20.774
I ASKED THEM TO DO
ONE DAMN THING.

02:20.807 --> 02:23.677
ONE THING!
THIS IS WHY WE'RE LOSING MONEY.

02:23.710 --> 02:27.581
SEBASTIAN, YOU KNOW,
HE'S KIND OF ABRASIVE AT TIMES.

02:27.614 --> 02:29.583
SOMETIMES, THE THINGS HE SAYS
ARE LIKE, WHAT?

02:29.616 --> 02:30.000
I MEAN, IT'S A BIG JOKE
TO EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.118
I MEAN, IT'S A BIG JOKE
TO EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

02:31.151 --> 02:33.453
BIG JOKE.
THEY'RE NOT PAYING THE BILLS.

02:33.487 --> 02:34.788
PEOPLE ARE SCARED
OF SEBASTIAN.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.323
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

02:36.356 --> 02:37.958
I DON'T DEAL WITH CRAP.
I DON'T.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.292
YOU MAKE SOMETHING WRONG,

02:39.326 --> 02:40.827
I'VE TOLD YOU
HOW TO MAKE IT SIX TIMES,

02:40.861 --> 02:42.129
I HAVE NO PROBLEM
WITH FIRING YOU.

02:42.162 --> 02:43.630
I HAVE NO PROBLEM AT ALL.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.699
I FIRED 49 PEOPLE
IN THE LAST YEAR.

02:48.435 --> 02:50.103
I'M STILL GETTING USED
TO THE MENU.

02:53.240 --> 02:55.742
IT GETS EXHAUSTING,
EXPLAINING THE MENU.

02:55.776 --> 02:59.479
I KNOW.
IT'S OVERWHELMING.

02:59.513 --> 03:00.000
I'VE CREATED A UNIQUE MENU
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.515
I'VE CREATED A UNIQUE MENU
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.450
WE HAVE 23 GOURMET FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

03:03.483 --> 03:05.852
THERE'S 21 GOURMET FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

03:05.886 --> 03:08.255
THERE'S 20 GOURMET FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

03:08.288 --> 03:09.823
WAIT.

03:09.856 --> 03:11.692
PICK A FLAVOR COMBINATION.

03:11.725 --> 03:14.628
AND THEN YOU ADD BEEF, CHICKEN,
PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM, OR STEAK.

03:14.661 --> 03:17.030
SHRIMP.

03:17.064 --> 03:18.565
WAIT, CAN I START OVER?

03:18.598 --> 03:20.467
SO THE MEAT
IS IN THE COMBINATIONS.

03:20.500 --> 03:22.636
IF I SAW IT, I CAN DO IT.
I MEAN, 'CAUSE...

03:22.669 --> 03:23.904
NO, NO, IT'S CHICKEN.

03:23.937 --> 03:25.205
NO, LET ME START OVER.

03:25.238 --> 03:26.707
LET ME LOOK AT IT
REAL QUICK.

03:28.809 --> 03:30.000
THAT'S SERIOUSLY THE MENU.

03:30.000 --> 03:30.610
THAT'S SERIOUSLY THE MENU.

03:33.580 --> 03:36.083
THE MAJORITY OF THE SERVERS
ARE ACTORS.

03:36.116 --> 03:38.085
WE ALL KNOW IT'S REAL EXPENSIVE
TO LIVE IN L. A.,

03:38.118 --> 03:39.953
SO WE NEED TO MAKE MONEY,

03:39.986 --> 03:42.956
BUT SEBASTIAN DOESN'T DO A GOOD
JOB OF RUNNING SEBASTIAN'S.

03:42.989 --> 03:45.225
SOMETHING GO IN OVER THERE?

03:45.258 --> 03:47.461
I'D SAY 90% OF THE TIME
WE ARE LOSING MONEY.

03:47.494 --> 03:48.795
CALL HIM.
DADDY!

03:48.829 --> 03:51.598
HEY, MAMA.
HEY.

03:51.631 --> 03:54.167
MY WIFE ORIGINALLY INVESTED
PROBABLY ABOUT $300, 000.

03:54.201 --> 03:55.235
WHAT'S UP, BUDDY?

03:56.536 --> 03:59.272
I'M VERY FORTUNATE
SHE DOES MAKE GOOD MONEY.

04:02.442 --> 04:04.644
YEAH, I WISH.
WE NEED CHECKS.

04:04.678 --> 04:08.014
I BASICALLY CONTROL
ALL OF THE CASH.

04:08.048 --> 04:09.816
THE INVESTMENT GETS
TO BE RESENTFUL

04:09.850 --> 04:12.352
BECAUSE IT'S SO DAUNTING.

04:12.385 --> 04:14.588
WE DID $490 TODAY.

04:14.621 --> 04:16.123
ALL DAY.

04:16.156 --> 04:18.859
IT'S HARD SOMETIMES
TO LOOK AT MY WIFE

04:18.892 --> 04:22.062
AND LET HER KNOW
THAT I DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.197
IF THINGS DON'T CHANGE HERE
AT SEBASTIAN'S--

04:24.231 --> 04:26.299
HEY, GUYS.

04:26.333 --> 04:27.801
I DON'T SEE US OPEN LONGER
THAN SIX MORE MONTHS.

04:27.834 --> 04:28.702
I REALLY DON'T.

04:28.735 --> 04:30.000
IT'S 8:00.

04:30.000 --> 04:31.071
IT'S 8:00.

04:31.104 --> 04:33.673
AND THERE'S NOBODY HERE, SO

04:33.707 --> 04:35.342
SO WE'RE GONNA GO.
LET'S GO.

04:35.375 --> 04:36.977
RIGHT OUTTA HERE.

04:37.010 --> 04:39.513
IT WOULD BE VERY SAD
FOR THIS PLACE TO CLOSE BECAUSE

04:39.546 --> 04:41.014
I LOVE THIS PLACE.

04:42.783 --> 04:45.118
COMING IN DAY TO DAY
AND TRYING TO DEAL WITH THAT,

04:45.152 --> 04:48.021
IT TAKES EVERY BIT OF STRENGTH
I HAVE SOMETIMES

04:48.054 --> 04:49.456
TO REALLY HOLD ON.

04:55.228 --> 04:58.498
LIVE MUSIC, WOOD FIRE,
BREAKFAST, PLASMA TVs.

04:58.532 --> 05:00.000
SEBASTIAN'S.
FINALLY FOUND IT.

05:00.000 --> 05:00.967
SEBASTIAN'S.
FINALLY FOUND IT.

05:01.001 --> 05:03.170
AND IT'S HERE
RIGHT AMONGST ALL THESE STUDIOS,

05:03.203 --> 05:05.572
AND ON THE FRONT
OUT THERE, VERY TACKY.

05:06.740 --> 05:09.176
I MEAN, GOD.

05:09.209 --> 05:10.343
SEBASTIAN.
YES.

05:10.377 --> 05:11.812
YEAH, GORDON.
HOW ARE YOU?

05:11.845 --> 05:12.712
YES, CHEF GORDON.
HOW ARE YOU, SIR?

05:12.746 --> 05:14.114
VERY WELL.
YOURSELF?

05:14.147 --> 05:15.749
PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.
LIKEWISE.

05:15.782 --> 05:17.217
WORKING HERE
WITH CHEF GORDON RAMSAY

05:17.250 --> 05:18.819
IT'S LIKE AS AN ACTOR,

05:18.852 --> 05:21.087
HAVING ROBERT DENIRO SAY,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

05:21.121 --> 05:22.622
"I'M GONNA HELP YOU
WITH THIS ROLE."

05:22.656 --> 05:23.790
MAN!

05:23.824 --> 05:25.625
LET ME TAKE A SEAT.
PLEASE.

05:25.659 --> 05:26.693
I'LL GO TO THIS ONE HERE,
ACTUALLY.
OKAY.

05:26.726 --> 05:29.462
THANK YOU.

05:29.496 --> 05:30.000
DO YOU ALWAYS SERVE?
DO I ALWAYS SERVE?

05:30.000 --> 05:31.131
DO YOU ALWAYS SERVE?
DO I ALWAYS SERVE?

05:31.164 --> 05:32.732
NO, BUT I DO GREET AND MEET

05:32.766 --> 05:34.534
EVERY CUSTOMER THAT WALKS
IN THE DOOR.

05:34.568 --> 05:36.469
EVERY SINGLE CUSTOMER.

05:36.503 --> 05:38.138
WHETHER I COME OVER
AND JUST SAY HELLO,

05:38.171 --> 05:39.472
OR I SPEND TEN MINUTES,
SIT DOWN,

05:39.506 --> 05:40.807
AND HAVE A GLASS
OF WINE WITH YOU.

05:40.841 --> 05:41.508
YOU SIT DOWN WITH THE CUSTOMERS
AND DRINK WINE?

05:41.541 --> 05:42.509
WHY NOT?

05:46.446 --> 05:47.848
ME.

05:49.516 --> 05:51.184
THERE'S PHOTOGRAPHS
ON THE MENU.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.552
PICTURES.

05:52.586 --> 05:54.387
ARE THESE REAL,
THESE PHOTOGRAPHS?
YES.

05:54.421 --> 05:56.423
YES, THEY ARE, SIR.
I TOOK THOSE MYSELF.

05:56.456 --> 05:59.826
IT LOOKS GHASTLY.

05:59.860 --> 06:00.000
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
ONE SIMPLE RULE.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.995
I'VE ALWAYS HAD
ONE SIMPLE RULE.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.763
YES, SIR.
WHENEVER YOU COME
ACROSS A MENU WITH PHOTOGRAPHS,

06:03.797 --> 06:07.100
GET THE  OUT OF THERE.

06:07.133 --> 06:10.770
OUR MENU CONCEPT
IS VERY UNUSUAL AND UNIQUE.

06:10.804 --> 06:12.038
I LOVE THE VARIETY.

06:12.072 --> 06:13.473
WOULD YOU LIKE
A WALK-THROUGH

06:13.506 --> 06:16.142
OF OUR MAIN CONCEPT
OF THE MENU?

06:16.176 --> 06:17.544
CONCEPT?
WE HAVE A CONCEPT.

06:17.577 --> 06:18.912
PLEASE.

06:18.945 --> 06:20.914
OVER HERE IS OUR MAIN CONCEPT
OF THE RESTAURANT.

06:20.947 --> 06:23.350
WHAT WE HAVE
IS 20 DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS

06:23.383 --> 06:25.819
OF MARINADES,
TOPPINGS, AND SEASONINGS.

06:25.852 --> 06:27.454
WHAT YOU DO IS YOU CHOOSE ONE.

06:27.487 --> 06:28.788
AND THEN YOU ADD IT
TO EITHER CHICKEN,

06:28.822 --> 06:30.000
PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM,
NEW YORK STRIP,

06:30.000 --> 06:30.423
PORTOBELLO MUSHROOM,
NEW YORK STRIP,

06:30.457 --> 06:31.892
OR SHRIMP.

06:31.925 --> 06:34.995
ANGUS RIB-EYE, PRIME CUT
THAT'S CUT FOR SEBASTIAN'S.

06:35.028 --> 06:38.298
YOU CAN HAVE ONE OF THESE
COMBINATIONS WITH AN ENTREE.

06:38.331 --> 06:40.500
WITH CHIPS AND GRAVY
ON THE SIDE, IF YOU'D LIKE.

06:40.533 --> 06:42.469
WITH ONE OF OUR SIDE SALADS.

06:49.943 --> 06:51.645
AVAILABLE
AT ANY POINT IN TIME,

06:51.678 --> 06:54.014
WE HAVE A HALF-POUND
ANGUS PRIME BURGER.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.450
I HAD ACTUALLY 20 MORE.

06:57.484 --> 06:58.518
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

06:58.551 --> 06:59.886
YES, SIR.

06:59.920 --> 07:00.000
GOD, I'VE NEVER HEARD
SUCH A COMPLEX MENU

07:00.000 --> 07:02.122
GOD, I'VE NEVER HEARD
SUCH A COMPLEX MENU

07:02.155 --> 07:03.156
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

07:03.189 --> 07:05.258
PROBABLY NOT.

07:05.292 --> 07:08.662
OKAY. OKAY, I'M GONNA START
WITH SOME CALAMARI.

07:08.695 --> 07:09.663
CALAMARI?
YES.

07:09.696 --> 07:10.931
THEY'RE FRESH?

07:10.964 --> 07:12.565
YES, IT IS.
SMALL PORTION OF CALAMARI.

07:12.599 --> 07:14.401
OKAY.
UM...

07:14.434 --> 07:17.070
CHEF GORDON QUESTIONED
THE QUALITY OF THE CALAMARI.

07:17.103 --> 07:19.139
MY CALAMARI IS FRESH.

07:19.172 --> 07:21.775
AND THEN, FOR MY ENTREE, I'D
LIKE TO HAVE A NEW YORK STRIP.

07:21.808 --> 07:22.909
OKAY.

07:22.943 --> 07:24.844
CAN YOU MAKE ME
A LITTLE FRESH PIZZA?

07:24.878 --> 07:26.346
YOU DECIDE.
WHAT TYPE OF PIZZA
WOULD YOU LIKE?

07:26.379 --> 07:27.013
I'LL DECIDE?
YUP.

07:27.047 --> 07:29.849
PERFECT.
THANK YOU.

07:29.883 --> 07:30.000
LOU, SET ME UP
A SMALL DOUGH, PLEASE.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.452
LOU, SET ME UP
A SMALL DOUGH, PLEASE.

07:34.554 --> 07:35.956
AND WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
SONIA.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.390
SONIA, GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HI.

07:37.424 --> 07:38.291
NICE TO MEET YOU.
WHAT DO YOU DO?

07:38.325 --> 07:39.793
UM...

07:39.826 --> 07:41.061
I'M AN ACTRESS.

07:41.094 --> 07:42.429
YOU'RE AN ACTRESS?
YES, I AM.

07:42.462 --> 07:44.064
ORDER UP.

07:44.097 --> 07:46.299
DO YOU PLAY WITH SEBASTIAN?

07:46.333 --> 07:47.968
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
'CAUSE HE'S AN ACTOR.

07:48.001 --> 07:49.302
OH, NO.
I HAVEN'T.
OKAY.

07:49.336 --> 07:50.603
AND THE CALAMARI...

07:50.637 --> 07:51.972
ARE THEY FRESH
OR ARE THEY FROZEN?

07:52.005 --> 07:54.708
THEY ARE FROZEN.
FROZEN.

07:57.744 --> 07:59.379
*

07:59.412 --> 08:00.000
OH, DEAR.

08:00.000 --> 08:00.981
OH, DEAR.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.149
HE TOLD ME THEY'RE FRESH.

08:03.183 --> 08:04.784
AND THEY'RE NOT FRESH.
THEY'RE FROZEN.

08:04.818 --> 08:06.720
THAT CONFIRMS
TWO THINGS.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.823
CHEF.

08:09.856 --> 08:12.125
AND A DISHONEST ONE.

08:12.158 --> 08:14.461
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

08:14.494 --> 08:15.495
NO?

08:17.497 --> 08:20.300
HE ASKED ME FOR A SICK BAG,

08:20.333 --> 08:23.103
WHICH I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY,
SO I WAS LIKE, OKAY.

08:23.136 --> 08:24.738
OH, GOD.

08:24.771 --> 08:26.840
HE SAID THAT
HE WANTED A PUKE BAG.

08:26.873 --> 08:28.241
EXCELLENT.
FANTASTIC.

08:28.274 --> 08:29.609
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY, THOUGH.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.000
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
OKAY.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.444
YOU DON'T HAVE TO SAY ANYTHING.
OKAY.

08:31.478 --> 08:32.379
JUST SAY, "YES, SIR"
AND WALK AWAY.
OKAY.

08:32.412 --> 08:35.181
NO PROBLEM.
OKAY.

08:35.215 --> 08:37.183
SEBASTIAN, JUST--YOU COULD TELL
IN HIS FACE

08:37.217 --> 08:40.420
THAT HE WASN'T VERY HAPPY
WITH THE COMMENT.

08:40.453 --> 08:43.390
I UNDERSTAND
THE GUY'S A PROFESSIONAL.

08:43.423 --> 08:46.593
BUT TO SAY SOMETHING LIKE THAT,
A SICK BAG, COME ON.

08:50.497 --> 08:52.432
THIS IS THE HOUSE SPECIALTY?

08:52.465 --> 08:54.634
YES.
YES, AND WHAT KIND
OF PIZZA IS IT?

08:54.667 --> 08:55.969
WHAT FLAVOR?
IT'S A POP-EYE PIZZA.

08:56.002 --> 08:57.170
POP-EYE.
YES.

08:57.203 --> 08:59.205
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

09:02.809 --> 09:04.210
HEY.

09:04.244 --> 09:05.979
SO I GOT THE CHEF HERE,
CHEF GORDON RAMSAY.

09:06.012 --> 09:09.182
YEAH, HE'S
IN THE DINING ROOM EATING.

09:09.215 --> 09:11.851
YEAH.
HE THINKS MY FOOD IS TERRIBLE.

09:13.253 --> 09:15.255
YUP, A WAITRESS ASKED, "CAN I
GET YOU ANYTHING ELSE?"

09:15.288 --> 09:17.057
HE SAID, "YEAH, A SICK BAG."

09:17.090 --> 09:18.691
YEAH.
I DON'T AGREE WITH HIS OPINION.

09:20.693 --> 09:23.997
AH, CAN'T THROW HIM OUT.
YEAH.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.899
WITH TWO WOOD BURNING OVENS
THERE,

09:25.932 --> 09:27.767
I THOUGHT AT LEAST
THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO

09:27.801 --> 09:29.636
BE IN A POSITION TO DO
A STUNNING PIZZA,

09:29.669 --> 09:30.000
BUT THE BASE IS SOGGY.

09:30.000 --> 09:31.004
BUT THE BASE IS SOGGY.

09:31.037 --> 09:32.238
IT'S ALL WATERY.

09:32.272 --> 09:33.740
I'M SURE HE TOLD ME

09:33.773 --> 09:36.443
THEY MAKE THE FRESH PIZZA
DOUGH HERE.

09:36.476 --> 09:39.212
SONIA.

09:39.245 --> 09:41.114
I WANT YOU TO PLATE IT TO HIM

09:41.147 --> 09:43.883
AND I WANT YOU TO SAY, "AS
SEBASTIAN'S MOTHER WOULD SAY,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.752
"MANGIA."
MANGIA?

09:45.785 --> 09:47.654
YEAH.

09:47.687 --> 09:49.689
STEAK, AND AS SEBASTIAN'S
MOTHER WOULD SAY,

09:49.722 --> 09:51.391
MANGIA.

09:58.164 --> 10:00.000
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TOMANGIAWITHOUT

10:00.000 --> 10:00.200
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT
TOMANGIAWITHOUT

10:00.233 --> 10:02.102
YES, OF COURSE.
MY KNIFE AND FORK.

10:02.135 --> 10:03.536
I'M SORRY, I SHOULD
HAVE BROUGHT YOU A CLEAN ONE.

10:03.570 --> 10:05.338
YOU'VE GOT THE PART.
RELAX.
THANKS.

10:05.371 --> 10:06.372
OKAY.

10:09.175 --> 10:11.611
IT LOOKS LIKE A CAN
OF DOG FOOD.

10:11.644 --> 10:13.713
WHAT AN EMBARRASSMENT
TO NEW YORK STRIP STEAK.

10:17.684 --> 10:20.019
JUST CHOPPED AND COOKED TO HELL.

10:20.053 --> 10:21.754
EVERYTHING'S UNDER SEASONED.

10:21.788 --> 10:24.057
ENOUGH CANNED PET FOOD
FOR TODAY.

10:27.794 --> 10:29.729
RIGHT NOW, OKAY?
IN MY MIND,
YES.

10:29.762 --> 10:30.000
I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN ACT.

10:30.000 --> 10:31.698
I'M HOPING THAT YOU CAN ACT.

10:31.731 --> 10:33.299
BECAUSE YOU CLEARLY
CAN'T COOK.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.502
THE FOOD WAS SHOCKING.

10:35.535 --> 10:37.504
THE CALAMARI
WEREN'T EVEN FRESH.

10:37.537 --> 10:39.105
WHY'D YOU NEED TO LIE TO ME
ON A PROFESSIONAL FRONT?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.907
CALAMARI.
THEY'RE FRESH?

10:40.940 --> 10:42.008
YES, IT IS.

10:42.041 --> 10:43.943
THEY ARE FROZEN.
FROZEN.

10:43.977 --> 10:46.846
I'M NOT GONNA BUY TOP CALAMARI
TO MIX IN THE SEAFOOD MEDLEY.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.448
WE'RE NOT A FOUR-STAR
RESTAURANT.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.416
EVERYTHING
IS COOKED TO ORDER.

10:50.450 --> 10:53.186
EVEN OUR HAMBURGERS THAT WE JUST
STARTED MAKING, WE MAKE FRESH.

10:53.219 --> 10:54.687
PIZZA DOUGH?
PIZZA DOUGH, NO.

10:54.721 --> 10:56.322
THAT COMES IN
FLASH-FROZEN FOR US.

10:56.356 --> 10:59.092
I THOUGHT PIZZA
WAS YOUR SPECIALTY.

10:59.125 --> 11:00.000
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT THIS PLACE WAS FAMED FOR.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.161
I THOUGHT THAT'S
WHAT THIS PLACE WAS FAMED FOR.

11:01.194 --> 11:04.297
NO, SIR, OUR MENU,
THAT CONCEPT THAT BAFFLES YOU,

11:04.330 --> 11:07.167
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE FAMOUS FOR.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.002
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE QUEUING UP
AT THE DOOR

11:09.035 --> 11:11.237
AND YOU'RE PACKING
THEM IN RIGHT NOW.

11:11.271 --> 11:13.273
UM, I DON'T KNOW
WHY MY BUSINESS ISN'T HERE.

11:13.306 --> 11:15.542
YOU'RE TELL ME NOW
THAT THOSE 20 COMBINATIONS

11:15.575 --> 11:17.310
IS SOMETHING THAT'S BLOWN
YOUR CUSTOMERS AWAY.

11:17.343 --> 11:19.078
UNBELIEVABLY.
EVERYONE THAT--

11:19.112 --> 11:22.215
BLOWING THEM TO THE OTHER END
OF THE  WORLD.

11:22.248 --> 11:24.417
I WAS BASICALLY KICKED
IN THE FACE.

11:24.450 --> 11:26.819
TO ME, THAT SHOWS IGNORANCE.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.188
AND A LACK OF RESPECT.

11:28.221 --> 11:30.000
I TRULY HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR THE MAN.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.423
I TRULY HAVE NO RESPECT
FOR THE MAN.

11:30.456 --> 11:33.927
AND HIS AWARDS, THEY MEAN
NOTHING TO ME AT THIS POINT.

11:33.960 --> 11:35.929
OKAY, MY PIZZAS

11:35.962 --> 11:38.331
SOON WILL BE
IN SUPERMARKETS.

11:38.364 --> 11:39.566
WHAT?

11:39.599 --> 11:41.134
I WOULD LOVE TO FRANCHISE THIS

11:41.167 --> 11:42.702
AND HAVE A SEBASTIAN'S
ALL OVER THE WORLD.

11:42.735 --> 11:43.937
OH, MY GOD.

11:43.970 --> 11:45.672
JUST THINK HOW THAT SOUNDS.

11:45.705 --> 11:47.340
SEBASTIAN'S ALL OVER THE WORLD.
THAT MAKES ME EXCITED.

11:47.373 --> 11:50.143
YOU HAVEN'T GOT  ONE
RIGHT SO FAR.

11:50.176 --> 11:53.112
HOW THE  CAN
YOU THINK ABOUT TWO?

11:53.146 --> 11:54.214
I NEED SOME FRESH AIR.

11:54.247 --> 11:55.548
THE GUY'S GONE.

11:57.016 --> 12:00.000
THIS GUY IS SERIOUSLY
OFF HIS  TROLLEY.

12:00.000 --> 12:00.186
THIS GUY IS SERIOUSLY
OFF HIS  TROLLEY.

12:00.220 --> 12:02.822
I JUST WON THAT ONE.
I WON THAT ONE.

12:02.855 --> 12:07.293
WHAT ON EARTH IS GOING ON
IN HIS  DELUSIONAL MIND?

12:07.327 --> 12:10.663
WHOO! I WON THAT ONE.
I WON THAT ONE.

12:10.697 --> 12:12.398
HE WAS GIVING ME.
I WAS GIVING IT BACK TO HIM.

12:12.432 --> 12:13.333
AND HE WAS LIKE, UH...

12:13.366 --> 12:14.567
- WHATEVER.
- SEBASTIAN?

12:14.601 --> 12:16.069
YES?
HELLO CHEF.

12:19.505 --> 12:20.974
LISTEN, BIG BOY.

12:21.007 --> 12:23.209
RIGHT NOW, YOU'VE WON
JACK.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.144
YOU GOT THE AUDACITY TO STAND
THERE TALKING TO ME

12:25.178 --> 12:26.846
ABOUT A FRANCHISE.

12:28.715 --> 12:30.000
IT TOOK EVERYTHING IN ME
NOT TO JUST

12:30.000 --> 12:31.284
IT TOOK EVERYTHING IN ME
NOT TO JUST

12:31.317 --> 12:32.819
FREAK OUT.

12:32.852 --> 12:34.587
I BEEN HERE TWO YEARS.

12:34.621 --> 12:36.522
IT MIGHT NOT SEEM LIKE A LONG--
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SHOW?

12:36.556 --> 12:37.557
WHAT HAVE I GOT TO SHOW?
YEAH.

12:37.590 --> 12:38.591
I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT I HAVE TO SHOW.
TELL ME.

12:38.625 --> 12:39.292
PRIDE.
PRIDE.

12:39.325 --> 12:40.627
YOU'RE DELUSIONAL.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.328
YOU ARE--
THAT IS YOUR OPINION, SIR.

12:42.362 --> 12:44.063
A LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL
THAT WAY ABOUT YOU.

12:47.066 --> 12:48.534
WHAT'S SUCCESSFUL
ABOUT OUT THERE?

12:48.568 --> 12:49.936
I'M STILL HERE.

12:49.969 --> 12:51.404
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES IT SUCCESSFUL?

12:51.437 --> 12:53.606
YOU JUST ANSWERED
MY QUESTION.

12:53.640 --> 12:54.607
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.608
YEAH?

12:55.642 --> 12:56.976
ME.

12:57.010 --> 12:59.178
WHOO!

13:00.380 --> 13:01.247
I THINK I WON THAT ONE.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.915
YES!

13:02.949 --> 13:05.518
COMING UP, GORDON FINDS
THAT WHEN IT COMES TO COOKING,

13:05.551 --> 13:07.120
IT'S FROZEN.

13:07.153 --> 13:08.388
FROZEN.

13:08.421 --> 13:10.356
SEBASTIAN THINKS INSIDE THE BOX.

13:10.390 --> 13:11.724
YOU'RE HAPPY
TO BE

13:11.758 --> 13:13.559
A FAKE CHEF,
AREN'T YOU?

13:13.593 --> 13:14.927
AND LATER, WHEN SEBASTIAN
LOSES IT,

13:14.961 --> 13:16.596
THIS IS MY  LIFE.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.464
WE'RE DONE.
GET THE CAMERA OUTTA HERE.

13:18.498 --> 13:20.867
GORDON TELLS IT LIKE IT IS.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.069
I'VE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER

13:23.102 --> 13:25.238
MET SOMEONE

13:25.271 --> 13:29.142
I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

13:29.175 --> 13:30.000
COMING UP ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

13:30.000 --> 13:30.932
COMING UP ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

13:36.014 --> 13:38.584
AFTER A LUNCH THAT
WAS NOT ONLY DISAPPOINTING,

13:38.617 --> 13:43.789
BUT CONFUSING, GORDON RETURNS
TO OBSERVE A DINNER SERVICE.

13:43.822 --> 13:45.557
WHAT'S UP, BEAUTIFUL?
HI.

13:45.591 --> 13:47.459
HOW YOU DOING?
GOOD.

13:47.492 --> 13:49.828
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
HOW ARE YOU?

13:49.862 --> 13:51.330
I'M GONNA COME OUT AND HAVE
A BEER WITH YOU GUYS.

13:51.363 --> 13:52.898
NICE.
YES.

13:52.931 --> 13:54.800
WE GET A LOT OF DIRECTORS,
PRODUCERS,

13:54.833 --> 13:56.201
YOU KNOW, INDUSTRY PEOPLE
COMING IN.

13:56.235 --> 13:57.703
YEAH.
YEAH, MAN.

13:57.736 --> 13:59.838
I'M LIKE, HOLY ,
HOW DO I KNOW THIS GUY?

14:02.174 --> 14:02.578
THE MAJORITY OF THE SERVERS
ARE ACTORS, RAPPERS, MODELS.

14:02.578 --> 14:03.909
THE MAJORITY OF THE SERVERS
ARE ACTORS, RAPPERS, MODELS.

14:03.942 --> 14:07.112
WELL...

14:07.145 --> 14:08.814
I'M A MODEL MYSELF.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.083
I'VE GOTTEN A COUPLE GIGS
OFF WORKING AT SEBASTIAN'S.

14:11.116 --> 14:14.052
HOW YOU DOIN', BROTHER?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

14:14.086 --> 14:16.021
SEBASTIAN'S IS THE YOUNG
WHO'S WHO OF HOLLYWOOD.

14:16.054 --> 14:17.456
BUT FOR THESE YOUNG ACTORS,

14:17.489 --> 14:19.524
THEIR BIGGEST PERFORMANCE
HAPPENS NIGHTLY WHEN

14:19.558 --> 14:23.962
THEY HAVE TO SELL SEBASTIAN'S
OVERCOMPLICATED MENU.

14:23.996 --> 14:25.430
OKAY, LET ME EXPLAIN
THE MENU TO YOU.

14:25.464 --> 14:26.632
IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT.

14:26.665 --> 14:29.067
THERE'S 20 GOURMET FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

14:29.101 --> 14:31.069
YOU DECIDE IF YOU WANT CHICKEN,
PORTOBELLO MUSHROOMS,

14:31.103 --> 14:32.578
NEW YORK STRIP...

14:32.578 --> 14:33.939
NEW YORK STRIP...

14:33.972 --> 14:36.141
IT CAN TAKE UP TO 20 MINUTES
BECAUSE THERE'S SO MANY

14:36.174 --> 14:36.942
DIFFERENT COMBINATIONS, AND SO
MANY DIFFERENT OPTIONS

14:36.975 --> 14:38.477
YOU HAVE ON OUR MENU.

14:38.510 --> 14:41.079
AND YOU DECIDE IF YOU WOULD LIKE
IT IN A ROLL AS A SANDWICH,

14:41.113 --> 14:43.782
ON A BED OF LETTUCE AS A SALAD,
OR JUST AS AN ENTREE.

14:48.186 --> 14:50.555
WHILE THE WAITRESSES
STRUGGLE WITH THE MENU,

14:50.589 --> 14:53.292
GORDON HOPES TO OBSERVE
SEBASTIAN LEADING THE KITCHEN.

14:53.325 --> 14:55.427
BUT THAT IS NOT THE CASE.

14:55.460 --> 14:58.363
Q, I'M SELLING TABLE 100.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.932
I GOT THE SICILIANO.

14:59.965 --> 15:02.100
GET ME THE SHRIMP PITTSBURG
WITH THE CAPRESE SALAD.

15:02.134 --> 15:02.578
IT'S COMING
IN 20 SECONDS.

15:02.578 --> 15:03.969
IT'S COMING
IN 20 SECONDS.

15:04.002 --> 15:05.437
I LOVE TO COOK.
THAT'S MY PASSION.

15:05.470 --> 15:06.672
I LOVE TO COOK, SO IT'S CRAZY,

15:06.705 --> 15:08.607
BUT MY STRONG POINT
IS WHEN WE'RE BUSY.

15:08.640 --> 15:09.875
YOU GET ALL OF THIS.
ALL OF THIS, RIGHT?

15:09.908 --> 15:10.809
ALL OF THIS.

15:15.814 --> 15:17.582
AND THEN YOU DEEP FRY IT?

15:19.551 --> 15:21.153
BLOODY HELL.

15:21.186 --> 15:23.055
IS THERE ANYTHING
THAT'S EVER COOKED HOMEMADE?

15:25.057 --> 15:27.259
VERY RARE, LOU?

15:27.292 --> 15:29.328
AND WHAT YOU PUT IN THERE?

15:29.361 --> 15:31.196
THIS IS JUST THE POTATOES.
WE JUST PIPE 'EM THROUGH.

15:31.229 --> 15:32.578
AND YOU MAKE
FRESH CREAM POTATOES?

15:32.578 --> 15:32.664
AND YOU MAKE
FRESH CREAM POTATOES?

15:32.698 --> 15:34.633
I BELIEVE IT COMES IN FROZEN.
FROZEN.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.335
SO WHAT DO YOU DO TO IT?

15:36.368 --> 15:38.303
WE JUST HEAT IT UP.
YOU JUST HEAT IT UP?

15:38.337 --> 15:40.038
SO IT'S NOT EVEN POWDERED MASH,
IT'S ALREADY MADE

15:40.072 --> 15:42.074
IN THE FACTORY
AND IT COMES IN?

15:42.107 --> 15:43.642
YES.
WOW.

15:43.675 --> 15:45.410
PROCESSED MASHED POTATO.

15:45.444 --> 15:48.981
NOTICING THE LACK OF FRESH FOOD,

15:49.014 --> 15:52.651
GORDON HEADS TO THE FRIDGE
TO CONFIRM HIS SUSPICIONS.

15:52.684 --> 15:55.454
AND WHAT HE FINDS
IS A KEY REASON

15:55.487 --> 15:57.422
AS TO WHY THE RESTAURANT
IS FAILING.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.191
WELL...

15:59.224 --> 16:01.093
IT'S DEFINITELY PROCESSED.

16:01.126 --> 16:02.578
A FRIDGE STOCKED WITH
PREPACKAGED FROZEN FOOD.

16:02.578 --> 16:04.296
A FRIDGE STOCKED WITH
PREPACKAGED FROZEN FOOD.

16:04.329 --> 16:08.834
NOTHING'S FRESH MADE?
IT'S ALL BOUGHT-IN SAUCES?
YES, SIR.

16:08.867 --> 16:09.835
YES.

16:09.868 --> 16:10.836
YES.
BUY-IN.

16:10.869 --> 16:12.137
YES.

16:12.170 --> 16:14.139
I DON'T THINK
WE SHOULD BE SERVING

16:14.172 --> 16:15.941
AS MUCH OF THE STUFF THAT WE DO
OUT OF CANS.

16:15.974 --> 16:18.243
AND I THINK THAT MOST OF THE
STUFF THAT WE SERVE OUT OF CANS,

16:18.276 --> 16:19.945
WE CAN PROBABLY
MAKE THAT IN-HOUSE.

16:19.978 --> 16:23.015
WHERE'S YOUR
BOUGHT-IN DOUGH?

16:23.048 --> 16:24.983
AND TO GORDON'S AMAZEMENT,

16:25.017 --> 16:27.786
EVEN THE PIZZA DOUGH IS FROZEN
AT THIS PIZZERIA.

16:27.819 --> 16:30.589
AND YOU GET THEM IN FROZEN?
YES, COMES IN FROZEN.

16:30.622 --> 16:32.578
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
FROZEN DOUGHS I'VE SEEN.

16:32.578 --> 16:34.159
I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE BEST
FROZEN DOUGHS I'VE SEEN.

16:34.192 --> 16:37.729
AND IT'S THE ONLY WE CAN,
RIGHT NOW, TO SAVE A DOLLAR.

16:39.398 --> 16:42.067
WITH THE PRESENCE OF
A WORLD-CLASS CHEF IN THE HOUSE,

16:42.100 --> 16:44.503
SEBASTIAN DECIDES
IT'S TIME TO TAKE OVER

16:44.536 --> 16:46.772
IN AN ATTEMPT
TO IMPRESS CHEF RAMSAY.

16:46.805 --> 16:48.373
MARCELLI, LOU.
PIZZA.

16:48.407 --> 16:49.608
US THREE WORK HERE.

16:49.641 --> 16:50.942
OKAY?
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

16:50.976 --> 16:52.044
I GOT IT, LOU.

16:52.077 --> 16:53.111
I CAN DO IT.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.213
I CAN DO IT.

16:55.247 --> 16:57.149
I JUST MOVED LOU TO
ANOTHER STATION WHERE I THOUGHT

16:57.182 --> 16:58.550
SHE'D BE MORE USEFUL
AT THAT POINT.

16:58.583 --> 17:00.819
AND I COULD KINDA JUST
RE-GAIN THINGS.

17:00.852 --> 17:02.578
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY HE ASKED ME
TO COME OVER HERE.

17:02.578 --> 17:03.955
I HAVE NO IDEA WHY HE ASKED ME
TO COME OVER HERE.

17:03.989 --> 17:06.625
NEXT PIZZA YOU GUYS HAVE
I WANNA MAKE.

17:06.658 --> 17:09.060
I WAS REALLY WANTING
TO SHOW GORDON

17:09.094 --> 17:10.629
THAT MY ABILITY IS ENDLESS.

17:10.662 --> 17:12.230
THERE'S NOTHING I CAN'T COOK.

17:12.264 --> 17:14.232
PUT IT IN FRONT OF ME,
AND I'LL MAKE IT.

17:17.402 --> 17:18.770
THAT'S GONE NOW.

17:18.804 --> 17:20.205
THAT'S HISTORY.

17:20.238 --> 17:21.973
I THOUGHT THEY TASTE BETTER
THAN THEY LOOK.

17:22.007 --> 17:24.142
AND TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE,

17:24.176 --> 17:25.911
THIS PIZZERIA'S MOST IMPORTANT
COOKING DEVICE

17:25.944 --> 17:27.646
IS NOT THE PIZZA OVENS,

17:27.679 --> 17:29.147
BUT A MICROWAVE.

17:30.549 --> 17:31.683
ORDER UP.

17:31.716 --> 17:32.578
HOLY.

17:32.578 --> 17:34.152
HOLY.

17:34.186 --> 17:37.789
NOW SEBASTIAN'S CARELESSNESS
IS AFFECTING THE CUSTOMERS.

17:42.360 --> 17:44.596
I HAD A SALAD GO OUT,
AND IT HAD A HAIR IN IT.

17:44.629 --> 17:45.964
IS IT YOURS?

17:45.997 --> 17:48.867
IT'S NOT MY HAIR
BECAUSE IT'S NOT DYED.

17:48.900 --> 17:50.936
NO, I DON'T WANNA SEE
YOU EAT IT.

17:50.969 --> 17:52.504
THE WAITRESS CAME OVER TO ME
AND TOLD ME

17:52.537 --> 17:55.674
THAT THERE WAS A HAIR
IN HER SALAD.

17:55.707 --> 17:57.442
WHAT HAPPENED?

17:57.476 --> 17:59.377
I JUST TOOK A PIECE OF HAIR
OUT OF MY MOUTH.

17:59.411 --> 18:00.479
I WAS EATING THE SALAD.

18:00.512 --> 18:01.646
A PIECE OF HAIR?

18:01.680 --> 18:02.578
IT WAS GOING
DOWN MY THROAT.

18:02.578 --> 18:03.315
IT WAS GOING
DOWN MY THROAT.

18:03.348 --> 18:07.385
AND THEN MY FRIEND SAW ME
PULL IT OUT OF MY MOUTH.

18:07.419 --> 18:09.821
I'M GONNA MAKE YOU A FRESH, NEW
SALAD IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS.

18:09.855 --> 18:13.592
I DON'T THINK
I WANT ANOTHER SALAD.

18:13.625 --> 18:15.827
THE SALADS' GONE,
AND SO IS YOUR PIZZA.

18:15.861 --> 18:17.095
PIZZA'S ON US TONIGHT.

18:17.129 --> 18:19.297
THANK YOU.
YOU'RE WELCOME.

18:19.331 --> 18:20.832
FOOD THAT WAS COMPED.

18:20.866 --> 18:22.834
THERE WAS $300 WORTH
OF FOOD COMPED TONIGHT.

18:22.868 --> 18:24.669
WE GOT THAT ONE COMING OUT.

18:24.703 --> 18:26.271
WE  THIS ONE.
THIS ONE'S ON THE HOUSE.

18:26.304 --> 18:28.340
SHARE, MAKE SOME FRIENDS.

18:28.373 --> 18:29.641
THANK YOU.

18:29.674 --> 18:31.710
COME ON, PAY ATTENTION.

18:31.743 --> 18:32.578
WITH DINNER SERVICE
COMING TO AN END,

18:32.578 --> 18:33.979
WITH DINNER SERVICE
COMING TO AN END,

18:34.012 --> 18:36.148
GORDON HAS MANY CONCERNS.

18:40.352 --> 18:41.920
HEY, I NEED SOMEBODY
OVER HERE

18:41.953 --> 18:43.355
TO GET SOME
OF THESE PLATES GOING.

18:43.388 --> 18:46.591
NOT THE LEAST OF THEM BEING

18:46.625 --> 18:48.493
THAT THE OWNER SEEMS
TO BE UNCONCERNED

18:48.527 --> 18:49.995
YOU'LL COME BACK TOMORROW,

18:50.028 --> 18:51.229
I'LL BE SITTING
ON THE SAME COUCH,

18:51.263 --> 18:52.197
CURLED UP
WITH A BOTTLE OF VODKA,

18:52.230 --> 18:53.698
JUST GOING,.

18:53.732 --> 18:55.500
TALKIN' TO MYSELF.

18:55.534 --> 18:57.169
HOW ARE YOU, CHEF?

18:57.202 --> 18:58.837
FINE, THANK YOU.
AND YOU?

18:58.870 --> 19:00.906
I'M DOING OKAY.

19:00.939 --> 19:02.340
UH, YES, I AM.

19:02.374 --> 19:02.578
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT WAS...

19:02.578 --> 19:04.643
HE DIDN'T THINK THAT THAT WAS...

19:04.676 --> 19:05.644
PROFESSIONAL.

19:05.677 --> 19:07.179
DID YOU NEED ME, CHEF?

19:07.212 --> 19:08.647
I NEED TWO MINUTES WITH YOU
ON YOUR OWN.

19:08.680 --> 19:10.549
OKAY.

19:10.582 --> 19:13.552
I'M GONNA GET INSIDE
AND WORK.

19:13.585 --> 19:16.188
YOU GUYS GONNA HANG OUT
FOR A LITTLE BIT?
YEAH.

19:16.221 --> 19:18.523
I WAS KIND OF UPSET
AT CHEF GORDON AT THAT POINT.

19:18.557 --> 19:21.259
I FELT LIKE HE WAS BEING
A LITTLE UNREASONABLE.

19:21.293 --> 19:23.028
LET'S JUST HAVE
A LITTLE TASTE TOGETHER.

19:26.064 --> 19:31.236
*

19:31.269 --> 19:32.404
WHAT IS THAT TASTE
FOR YOU?

19:32.437 --> 19:32.578
IT'S NOT GREAT.

19:32.578 --> 19:33.405
IT'S NOT GREAT.

19:33.438 --> 19:35.173
IT'S A LITTLE DRY.

19:35.207 --> 19:37.809
IT'S CUT THE  END OFF,
SQUEEZE IT INTO THE CONTAINER,

19:37.842 --> 19:39.010
AND SEND IT.

19:39.044 --> 19:40.712
A LOT OF STUFF
ISN'T HOMEMADE.

19:40.745 --> 19:43.515
95% OF STUFF
IS BOUGHT-IN.

19:43.548 --> 19:45.650
UH, OKAY.
I WAS GONNA GO WITH 80%.

19:45.684 --> 19:48.253
THIS  IS THE MOST
DISGUSTING

19:48.286 --> 19:52.490
BOUGHT-IN CRAP I'VE EVER TASTED
IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.693
IT'S ALMOST MORE IMPORTANT
FOR ME

19:54.726 --> 19:57.462
TO LET THIS GO OUT
AT HALF ITS QUALITY

19:57.495 --> 20:00.031
AND GO OUT AND MAKE SURE
THAT THE GUESTS ARE HAPPY,

20:00.065 --> 20:02.000
AND MEET THE GUESTS,
AND TALK TO THEM.

20:02.033 --> 20:02.578
YOU'RE HAPPY...

20:02.578 --> 20:03.768
YOU'RE HAPPY...

20:03.802 --> 20:05.537
TO BE A FAKE CHEF,
AREN'T YOU?

20:05.570 --> 20:06.972
NO.

20:07.005 --> 20:09.474
BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE
I'M A FAKE CHEF.

20:09.507 --> 20:11.343
IT'S A FRANCHISABLE CONCEPT.

20:11.376 --> 20:14.246
WHY ARE YOU
SO  OBSESSED

20:14.279 --> 20:16.114
WITH BECOMING FAMOUS
WITH A FRANCHISE?

20:16.147 --> 20:17.749
WHY CAN'T YOU JUST HAVE
A RESTAURANT

20:17.782 --> 20:19.618
AND COOK YOUR ASS OFF

20:19.651 --> 20:22.153
AND GET CUSTOMERS IN HERE FOR
THE LOVE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING?

20:22.187 --> 20:26.358
I WAS HOPING THAT THIS WOULD BE
MY LAUNCHING PAD FOR MY NAME.

20:26.391 --> 20:29.894
HOW?

20:29.928 --> 20:31.263
THAT'S NOT COOKING.

20:31.296 --> 20:32.578
IF YOU ARE CONVINCED
IN YOUR MIND,

20:32.578 --> 20:33.965
IF YOU ARE CONVINCED
IN YOUR MIND,

20:33.999 --> 20:36.735
RIGHT.
THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS GONNA WORK

20:36.768 --> 20:39.437
YOU'RE BEYOND REACH,
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

20:39.471 --> 20:41.172
REALLY?

20:41.206 --> 20:42.641
ME.

20:43.675 --> 20:44.743
GONE.

20:44.776 --> 20:46.044
THE OLD MENU IS GONE
WITH THE WIND.

20:46.077 --> 20:46.945
END THE CONFUSION.

20:46.978 --> 20:48.079
BUT A NEW MENU,

20:48.113 --> 20:49.314
I DON'T SEE ANY UNIQUENESS.

20:49.347 --> 20:51.249
HAS SEBASTIAN SEEING RED.

20:51.283 --> 20:52.250
AND LATER...

20:52.284 --> 20:53.752
THIS IS MY  LIFE.

20:53.785 --> 20:55.654
WE'RE DONE.
GET THE CAMERA OUTTA HERE.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.689
HE JUST CHANGED
LIKE DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE.

20:57.722 --> 20:59.224
GORDON GIVES SEBASTIAN
THE PAINFUL TRUTH.

20:59.257 --> 21:02.193
I'VE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER

21:02.227 --> 21:02.578
MET SOMEONE

21:02.578 --> 21:04.362
MET SOMEONE

21:04.396 --> 21:07.832
I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

21:07.866 --> 21:10.835
COMING UP ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

21:16.773 --> 21:18.909
IN A TOWN KNOWN FOR ITS MOVIES,

21:18.942 --> 21:22.579
TONIGHT'S DINNER SERVICE
IS A MAJOR FLOP.

21:22.612 --> 21:26.249
THE NOMINEES FOR THE MOST
CONFUSED RESTAURANT

21:26.283 --> 21:30.087
IN HOLLYWOOD
IS SEBASTIAN'S,

21:30.120 --> 21:32.556
SEBASTIAN'S,

21:32.589 --> 21:35.892
AND SEBASTIAN'S.

21:35.926 --> 21:38.295
AND YOUR MOST FAMOUS WORDS
TONIGHT

21:38.328 --> 21:39.830
WAS NOT ANY FORM OF DELEGATION,

21:39.863 --> 21:41.498
ORGANIZING INSIGHT.

21:41.531 --> 21:42.404
"IT'S ON ME."

21:42.404 --> 21:44.601
"IT'S ON ME."

21:44.634 --> 21:46.236
"COMP THAT ONE."

21:46.269 --> 21:47.704
"I'LL TAKE CARE OF THAT BILL",

21:47.738 --> 21:49.039
"SERVE THAT TO THAT."

21:49.072 --> 21:50.874
YOU'RE RUNNING A BUSINESS.

21:50.907 --> 21:53.844
NOT A FREEBIE, DRIVE-BY,
PICK UP AND GO HOME.

21:53.877 --> 21:57.180
YOU SHOULD BE SAYING
THAT AT TEN TO NINE

21:57.214 --> 22:00.684
IN THE MIDDLE
OF A BLOODY BUSY NIGHT.

22:00.717 --> 22:02.619
WHAT DID WE COMP
IN TERMS OF DOLLARS?

22:02.652 --> 22:05.022
PROBABLY CLOSE TO 300.

22:05.055 --> 22:06.289
300 BUCKS?
YEAH.

22:07.524 --> 22:09.726
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.828
WORKING WITH GORDON
IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE.

22:11.862 --> 22:12.404
I FELT LIKE HE WAS BEING
A LITTLE UNREASONABLE.

22:12.404 --> 22:14.197
I FELT LIKE HE WAS BEING
A LITTLE UNREASONABLE.

22:14.231 --> 22:15.732
HERE'S THE THING.

22:15.766 --> 22:19.569
BIG CHANGE.

22:19.603 --> 22:23.740
WE WILL HAVE A NEW MENU.

22:25.308 --> 22:26.376
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

22:29.379 --> 22:36.620
*

22:38.655 --> 22:40.390
IT'S DAY TWO.

22:40.424 --> 22:42.404
AND AFTER YESTERDAY'S
EYE-OPENING OBSERVATIONS,

22:42.404 --> 22:42.993
AND AFTER YESTERDAY'S
EYE-OPENING OBSERVATIONS,

22:43.026 --> 22:46.530
IT'S TIME FOR GORDON TO GET
THROUGH TO THIS STUBBORN CHEF.

22:46.563 --> 22:49.900
WITH PREPACKAGED AND FROZEN FOOD
TURNING CUSTOMERS OFF,

22:49.933 --> 22:53.470
GORDON GETS THE STAFF HEADED
IN A NEW DIRECTION

22:53.503 --> 22:55.739
TO TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THE PIZZA OVENS,

22:55.772 --> 22:58.341
WHICH UP UNTIL NOW HAVE BEEN
USED JUST FOR SHOW,

22:58.375 --> 22:59.443
AND NOT FOR COOKING.

22:59.476 --> 23:01.311
SEBASTIAN'S, YES?
YES.

23:01.344 --> 23:03.847
NEEDS TO BECOME KNOWN
FOR ONE THING

23:03.880 --> 23:04.981
AND ONE THING ONLY.

23:05.015 --> 23:06.183
FRESH PIZZAS.

23:06.216 --> 23:07.317
WHAT ARE THOSE
TWO THINGS THERE?

23:07.350 --> 23:08.618
PIZZA OVENS.

23:08.652 --> 23:10.353
THIS PLACE COULD BECOME
SO POPULAR

23:10.387 --> 23:12.404
FOR HOMEMADE, FRESH,
WOOD-BURNING PIZZA.

23:12.404 --> 23:13.423
FOR HOMEMADE, FRESH,
WOOD-BURNING PIZZA.

23:13.457 --> 23:16.126
I'M NOT MAKING THE MONEY.

23:16.159 --> 23:17.661
AND IT'S QUITE EXPENSIVE

23:17.694 --> 23:18.962
TO REALLY START USING
FRESH DOUGH AGAIN.

23:18.995 --> 23:21.098
GUYS,
COME HERE.

23:21.131 --> 23:22.199
HAVE YOU

23:22.232 --> 23:23.433
OR YOU, OR YOU

23:23.467 --> 23:26.470
EVER TOSSED
A PIZZA DOUGH?

23:26.503 --> 23:27.804
NO.
NO.

23:27.838 --> 23:28.805
NOT YET.

23:28.839 --> 23:30.040
ALL OF YOU, YEAH?

23:30.073 --> 23:32.843
ARE NOW GONNA BECOME
GREAT TOSSERS.

23:32.876 --> 23:36.580
I'VE GOT TWO, PHENOMENAL,
EXPERT TOSSERS

23:36.613 --> 23:38.515
HERE NOW.

23:38.548 --> 23:39.649
GENTLEMEN, COME IN, PLEASE.

23:39.683 --> 23:41.384
COME AND SAY HELLO.

23:41.418 --> 23:42.404
GORDON BROUGHT IN A COUPLE
OF GUYS TO SHOW US

23:42.404 --> 23:43.320
GORDON BROUGHT IN A COUPLE
OF GUYS TO SHOW US

23:43.353 --> 23:44.187
HOW TO BE PIZZA TOSSERS
AND EVERYTHING.

23:44.221 --> 23:46.123
IT WAS JUST LIKE GOING
TO BENIHANA'S

23:46.156 --> 23:48.825
AND WATCHING THEM CHOP YOUR FOOD
AND COOK IT RIGHT AT THE TABLE.

23:48.859 --> 23:50.760
I THINK THIS LOOKS WONDERFUL
IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS.

23:50.794 --> 23:54.431
IF I SAT HERE WITH MY FAMILY
WATCHING YOU DO THIS,

23:54.464 --> 23:55.699
NOW, YEAH?

23:55.732 --> 23:57.601
I WANT YOU TO BECOME
THE PERFECT TOSSER.

23:57.634 --> 23:59.636
LOU, YOU'LL HAVE A GO.
YES?

23:59.669 --> 24:01.371
Q.
LET'S GO, GUYS.

24:01.404 --> 24:03.039
ALL OF US, YEAH?

24:03.073 --> 24:04.941
I'M UP FOR A CHALLENGE, AND
WILLING TO TRY SOMETHING NEW.

24:06.943 --> 24:07.911
GO, LOU.

24:10.947 --> 24:12.404
*

24:12.404 --> 24:16.720
*

24:16.753 --> 24:18.522
ONLY THING I HATE
ABOUT THAT WHOLE THING

24:18.555 --> 24:20.023
IS I HAVE TO GET RID
OF MY NAILS, BUT

24:20.056 --> 24:22.759
OTHER THAN THAT, I LOVE
THE FRESH PIZZA DOUGH.

24:22.792 --> 24:24.461
OKAY, GUYS, LET'S GO.

24:24.494 --> 24:26.062
AT THIS POINT IN THE GAME,

24:26.096 --> 24:27.697
ONE OF TWO THINGS HAS TO HAPPEN.

24:27.731 --> 24:30.901
I HAVE TO ACCEPT WHAT HE SAYS
AND GO WITH IT,

24:30.934 --> 24:33.803
OR ASK HIM TO LEAVE.

24:33.837 --> 24:35.071
COMING UP,

24:35.105 --> 24:37.240
WHEN THE KITCHEN HEATS UP,

24:38.475 --> 24:40.343
SEBASTIAN STARTS TO CRACK.

24:40.377 --> 24:41.478
OKAY.

24:41.511 --> 24:42.404
CAN GORDON REIN HIM IN?

24:42.404 --> 24:42.879
CAN GORDON REIN HIM IN?

24:42.913 --> 24:44.047
I'M STEPPING AWAY FROM YOU

24:44.080 --> 24:45.048
BECAUSE I DON'T WANNA
BE TOO CLOSE.

24:45.081 --> 24:45.815
YOU UNGRATEFUL...

24:45.849 --> 24:47.317
WELL, YOU HAVE NO IDEA--

24:47.350 --> 24:48.385
NASTY, VINDICTIVE.

24:48.418 --> 24:49.519
NO  IDEA.

24:49.553 --> 24:50.754
JOKER.

24:50.787 --> 24:52.489
YOU.
THAT'S IT, IS IT?

24:52.522 --> 24:53.757
COMING UP ON KITCHEN NIGHTMARES.

24:57.760 --> 24:59.528
IT'S DAY THREE.

24:59.561 --> 25:01.096
WHILE GORDON TOOK THE DAY TO GET
THE STAFF FOCUSED

25:01.130 --> 25:03.465
ON FRESH FOOD AND USING
THE BRICK PIZZA OVENS,

25:03.499 --> 25:05.868
HIS DESIGN TEAM WORKED OVERNIGHT

25:05.901 --> 25:07.236
TO TRANSFORM THE RESTAURANT.

25:07.269 --> 25:08.737
GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

25:08.771 --> 25:09.772
LADIES, HOW ARE WE?

25:09.805 --> 25:10.839
ARE WE WELL?

25:10.873 --> 25:14.376
I'M EXCITED TO SEE THE CHANGES
SUCH AS NEW DECOR.

25:14.410 --> 25:16.412
- GUYS, READY?
- YES.

25:16.445 --> 25:17.746
OKAY.
DON'T DROP THE BABY.

25:17.780 --> 25:19.548
LET'S GO.

25:19.581 --> 25:21.183
IN YOU GO.
GO GO GO GO GO.

25:21.216 --> 25:23.285
RIGHT.

25:27.756 --> 25:29.692
FIRST MINUTE I WALKED
IN THIS PLACE,

25:29.725 --> 25:31.527
IT WAS RIDICULOUS.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.730
IT FEELS NEW AND FRESH,
YES?

25:40.069 --> 25:42.104
IT'S JUST OVERWHELMING
THE WAY THE PLACE LOOKS.

25:46.875 --> 25:48.877
OH, MY ,
LOOK AT THE COUCHES.

25:48.911 --> 25:50.846
NEW CHAIRS, NEW COUCHES,
NEW LINEN.

25:50.879 --> 25:53.549
LITTLE BAR THERE
TO SERVE YOUR COCKTAILS FROM.

25:53.582 --> 25:55.461
THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS SO GORGEOUS.

25:55.461 --> 25:55.851
THIS IS GREAT.
THIS IS SO GORGEOUS.

26:00.556 --> 26:02.825
YOU START TO SEE JUST A NICE,

26:02.858 --> 26:04.460
VIBRANT, CLEAN LOOK.

26:06.829 --> 26:08.430
WOW.
IT LOOKS NEW.

26:08.464 --> 26:10.065
SEBASTIAN, THE FIRST TIME
I'VE HEARD YOU

26:10.099 --> 26:11.734
LOST FOR WORDS,
YES?

26:11.767 --> 26:13.669
YOU'RE SPEECHLESS.

26:13.702 --> 26:17.439
IT'S ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL.

26:17.473 --> 26:18.607
LOU, HAPPY?

26:18.640 --> 26:20.409
VERY, VERY.
YES? GOOD.

26:20.442 --> 26:21.543
THIS IS HUGE.

26:21.577 --> 26:23.312
IT'S BIGGER THAN BIG.

26:23.345 --> 26:25.461
I JUST CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW HAPPY
AND OVERWHELMED I AM NOW.

26:25.461 --> 26:26.548
I JUST CANNOT DESCRIBE HOW HAPPY
AND OVERWHELMED I AM NOW.

26:26.582 --> 26:28.283
ONE MORE THING.

26:28.317 --> 26:30.786
WE GOT RID
OF THE FROZEN PIZZA DOUGH.

26:30.819 --> 26:32.454
BECAUSE FROM THIS DAY ON,

26:32.488 --> 26:36.992
YOU'RE NOW GONNA BE MAKING
YOUR OWN DOUGH.

26:38.694 --> 26:40.362
THAT IS THE BEST OF THE BEST.

26:40.395 --> 26:43.899
IT IS AN EXTRAORDINARY PIECE
OF EQUIPMENT.

26:43.932 --> 26:45.567
LOU, COME OVER, MY DARLING.

26:45.601 --> 26:47.970
YOU WANTED FRESH DOUGH IN HERE,
IS THAT RIGHT?

26:48.003 --> 26:49.805
RUMOR HAS IT.
YES.

26:49.838 --> 26:51.573
NOW YOU CAN MAKE FRESH DOUGH
TO YOUR HEART'S CONTENT.

26:51.607 --> 26:52.841
DO YOU KNOW THAT?

26:52.875 --> 26:54.409
I WAS OVERWHELMED.

26:54.443 --> 26:55.461
I WAS LOOKING AT THAT MIXER.
IT WAS PHENOMENAL.

26:55.461 --> 26:56.912
I WAS LOOKING AT THAT MIXER.
IT WAS PHENOMENAL.

26:56.945 --> 26:59.148
NOW YOU'VE REALLY GOT YOUR WORK
CUT OUT, MY DARLING.

26:59.181 --> 27:00.949
YOU KNOW THAT?
OKAY, GOOD.

27:00.983 --> 27:02.885
THIS IS THE START, YEAH?

27:02.918 --> 27:04.353
OF SEBASTIAN'S TURNING AROUND.

27:04.386 --> 27:06.855
THERE'S NO EXCUSE ANYWHERE

27:06.889 --> 27:08.490
FROM DECOR TO WOOD-BURNING OVEN

27:08.524 --> 27:10.859
TO VIBRANT ATTITUDE
FROM THE STAFF,

27:10.893 --> 27:12.294
THE REAL WORK
STARTS TONIGHT.

27:12.327 --> 27:13.896
THERE'S NO EXCUSE.

27:13.929 --> 27:16.965
ALTHOUGH SEBASTIAN
CRAVES SUCCESS,

27:16.999 --> 27:18.667
HE HAS BEEN RESISTANT TO CHANGE.

27:18.700 --> 27:21.537
AND NOW HE'S ABOUT TO FACE
HIS BIGGEST FEAR.

27:21.570 --> 27:22.771
FIRST THING WE'RE GONNA DO

27:22.805 --> 27:24.039
IS PLAY TO OUR STRENGTHS.

27:24.072 --> 27:25.461
OKAY?

27:25.461 --> 27:25.874
OKAY?

27:25.908 --> 27:27.776
KINDA NOTICED
THAT HE WAS HOLDING TWO MENUS.

27:27.810 --> 27:29.845
ONE BEING MINE,
AND ONE BEING THE CHANGE

27:29.878 --> 27:31.380
THAT I THINK
I WAS MOST AFRAID OF.

27:31.413 --> 27:33.649
AND THAT REALLY MADE ME NERVOUS.

27:33.682 --> 27:35.551
WHAT I'M GONNA CONFIRM NOW

27:35.584 --> 27:38.120
IS THAT THE CONFUSION
HAS GONE.

27:38.153 --> 27:40.556
GONE, YEAH?
IS THE CONFUSION.

27:40.589 --> 27:42.357
GONE IS SEBASTIAN'S

27:42.391 --> 27:44.927
20 INGREDIENT MIX AND MATCH
FLAVOR MENU

27:44.960 --> 27:46.495
WITH PRE-PROCESSED FROZEN FOOD.

27:46.528 --> 27:48.864
IT LOOKS LIKE A CAN OF DOG FOOD.

27:48.897 --> 27:51.633
AND IN ITS PLACE
ARE MADE-TO-ORDER ITEMS

27:51.667 --> 27:53.602
USING FRESH AND HOMEMADE
INGREDIENTS.

27:53.635 --> 27:55.137
JUST HAVE A LOOK.

27:55.170 --> 27:55.461
LET ME READ YOU
THROUGH THE MENU FIRST, OKAY?

27:55.461 --> 27:57.272
LET ME READ YOU
THROUGH THE MENU FIRST, OKAY?

27:57.306 --> 27:58.974
PIZZAS,
ALL COOKED TO ORDER,

27:59.007 --> 28:00.576
ON OUR VERY OWN
WOOD-BURNING OVEN.

28:00.609 --> 28:02.711
A MARGARITA,
A SALAMI,

28:02.744 --> 28:04.246
A VEGETARIAN.

28:04.279 --> 28:06.248
GRILLED NEW YORK STEAK

28:06.281 --> 28:09.351
AND A WOOD-BURNING
OVEN-COOKED CHICKEN.

28:09.384 --> 28:11.820
THERE'S NOTHING QUITE
LIKE THIS CURRENTLY GOING ON

28:11.854 --> 28:13.455
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

28:13.488 --> 28:15.791
YOU HAVE GOT AN AMAZING CHANCE
TO SUCCEED HERE

28:15.824 --> 28:17.559
IF YOU KEEP IT SIMPLE.

28:17.593 --> 28:19.528
I LIKE THE NEW MENU.
IT'S SIMPLE.

28:19.561 --> 28:21.363
THE FRESH PRODUCTS,
AND THE FRESH DOUGH

28:21.396 --> 28:23.198
THAT'S A BIG THING FOR ME.

28:23.232 --> 28:24.833
TAKE AWAY THE INTIMIDATION,
SEBASTIAN.

28:24.867 --> 28:25.461
PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS.

28:25.461 --> 28:26.401
PLAY TO YOUR STRENGTHS.

28:26.435 --> 28:28.303
USE WHAT YOU'VE GOT.

28:28.337 --> 28:30.339
WHEN GORDON SHOWED US
THE NEW MENU,

28:30.372 --> 28:31.807
I THINK IT WAS A BIT
OVERWHELMING

28:31.840 --> 28:33.408
FOR SEBASTIAN'S HEAD.

28:33.442 --> 28:35.344
ARE YOU UPSET
THERE'S NO PHOTOS ON THERE?

28:35.377 --> 28:36.845
THERE'S PHOTOGRAPHS ON THE MENU.

28:36.879 --> 28:39.181
THERE'S PICTURES OF THE FOOD.

28:39.214 --> 28:40.983
I TOOK THOSE MYSELF.

28:41.016 --> 28:42.918
NO, NO, THE PHOTOS

28:42.951 --> 28:45.020
ISN'T THE THING
THAT I'M CONCERNED OF.

28:45.053 --> 28:48.457
IT'S JUST, UH,
IT'S THE CHANGE I WAS SCARED OF.

28:48.490 --> 28:50.359
ARE YOU WORRIED
ABOUT THE SIZE OF THE MENU?

28:50.392 --> 28:53.362
NO, THE SIZE
ISN'T THE CONCERN.

28:53.395 --> 28:55.461
IT'S UH... I DON'T SEE
ANY UNIQUENESS.

28:55.461 --> 28:55.664
IT'S UH... I DON'T SEE
ANY UNIQUENESS.

28:55.697 --> 28:57.799
YOU'RE NOT GONNA NOW ASK ME
TO TURN AROUND AND SAY

28:57.833 --> 29:00.869
WHAT YOU GAVE ME IN TERMS
OF PIZZA WAS UNIQUE.

29:00.903 --> 29:02.971
I'VE CREATED A UNIQUE MENU
THAT NOBODY ELSE HAS.

29:03.005 --> 29:05.007
AND CHEF GORDON SAID,

29:05.040 --> 29:07.309
"I'VE NEVER SEEN A MENU LIKE
THIS BEFORE."

29:07.342 --> 29:10.112
SO I'M ASSUMING THAT
IT'S QUITE UNIQUE TO HIM ALSO.

29:10.145 --> 29:12.214
STOP TRYING TO BE
TOO CLEVER.

29:12.247 --> 29:14.583
DON'T TRY TO BE
TOO SMART.

29:14.616 --> 29:20.255
IF YOU ARE ANXIOUS
ABOUT 20 COMBINATIONS,

29:20.289 --> 29:22.991
IT'S 20 TIMES CONFUSING.

29:23.025 --> 29:25.160
I THOUGHT THERE'D BE MORE
COMPROMISE WITH MY MENU.

29:25.193 --> 29:25.461
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE
JUST COMPLETELY GONE.

29:25.461 --> 29:27.629
I DIDN'T EXPECT IT TO BE
JUST COMPLETELY GONE.

29:27.663 --> 29:30.165
I LOVE THAT MENU.

29:30.198 --> 29:33.068
YOU TRIED FOR TWO
AND A HALF YEARS.

29:33.101 --> 29:35.604
AND IT HASN'T WORKED.

29:35.637 --> 29:38.273
THAT'S THE END
OF THAT CHAPTER.

29:38.307 --> 29:41.176
WITH THE ACADEMY AWARDS FALLING
ON THE SAME NIGHT

29:41.209 --> 29:42.644
AS THE RE-LAUNCH,

29:42.678 --> 29:44.579
GORDON DECIDES
THAT THIS COINCIDENCE

29:44.613 --> 29:46.048
SHOULD BE TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF.

29:46.081 --> 29:48.116
AND IS ROLLING OUT
THE RED CARPET

29:48.150 --> 29:49.851
FOR AN OSCAR NIGHT PARTY.

29:49.885 --> 29:52.154
AND SEBASTIAN'S IS FULLY BOOKED.

29:52.187 --> 29:53.956
WE GONNA KICK ASS
AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE

29:53.989 --> 29:55.357
A WHOLE LOT BETTER TONIGHT.

29:55.390 --> 29:55.461
I LIKE TO SEE THIS PLACE ROCK.

29:55.461 --> 29:56.792
I LIKE TO SEE THIS PLACE ROCK.

30:00.529 --> 30:02.230
TONIGHT, EXPECT A LOTTA CHAOS.

30:02.264 --> 30:04.766
BUT IT SHOULD BE FUN.

30:04.800 --> 30:08.337
I'M FIGHTING RIGHT NOW STILL
INSIDE ABOUT THAT MENU.

30:08.370 --> 30:10.205
IT'S DRIVING ME CRAZY RIGHT NOW
IN MY HEAD.

30:10.238 --> 30:13.642
WE'RE SERVING 100 PEOPLE
IN 20 MINUTES.

30:13.675 --> 30:15.344
WITH THE KITCHEN HARD AT WORK

30:15.377 --> 30:16.745
WITH LAST MINUTE PREPARATIONS,

30:16.778 --> 30:19.247
SEBASTIAN IS STILL BROODING

30:19.281 --> 30:21.049
OVER GORDON'S OVERHAUL
OF HIS MENU.

30:21.083 --> 30:24.586
BIG JOKE TO EVERYBODY, RIGHT?

30:26.021 --> 30:28.256
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.
NOBODY WANTS TO CLEAN.

30:28.290 --> 30:30.492
OKAY, RIGHT.

30:30.525 --> 30:32.227
UH, SEBASTIAN.
WHERE IS HE?

30:32.260 --> 30:34.129
SEND EVERYBODY HOME
AND DO THE  MYSELF.

30:39.167 --> 30:40.235
WHERE'S SEBASTIAN?

30:40.268 --> 30:41.703
PROBABLY IN HIS OFFICE.

30:41.737 --> 30:43.071
IN HIS OFFICE?

30:43.105 --> 30:45.841
LOU!

30:45.874 --> 30:47.609
THIS PLACE IS A MESS.

30:47.642 --> 30:49.344
AND THE WAITERS,
THEY CAN'T EVEN CLEAN.

30:49.378 --> 30:50.612
I GOTTA COME IN
AND VACUUM THE RUGS.

30:50.645 --> 30:52.514
WHAT IS THAT ABOUT?

30:52.547 --> 30:54.516
ONE MINUTE HE CAN BE
THE HAPPY-GO-LUCKY SEBASTIAN.

30:54.549 --> 30:55.461
WHO PUT THIS CHAIR ON THE FLOOR?

30:55.461 --> 30:56.018
WHO PUT THIS CHAIR ON THE FLOOR?

30:56.051 --> 30:58.086
THIS IS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

30:58.120 --> 31:00.555
AND THEN WE WONDER WHY
WE'RE LOSING BUSINESS.

31:00.589 --> 31:01.623
OKAY.

31:04.126 --> 31:07.963
ANYBODY GONNA GET THE PHONE?

31:21.575 --> 31:23.477
IT'S OSCAR NIGHT.

31:23.510 --> 31:27.781
AND MORE IMPORTANTLY,
RE-LAUNCH NIGHT AT SEBASTIAN'S.

31:27.814 --> 31:29.382
I'M VERY EXCITED,

31:29.416 --> 31:32.185
AND WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE
SO MUCH FUN

31:32.219 --> 31:34.087
WITH THE NEW EVERYTHING.

31:34.121 --> 31:35.755
WHEREVER YOU WANT,
GRAB A SEAT.

31:35.789 --> 31:37.791
I'M REALLY EXCITED TO PROVE

31:37.824 --> 31:40.861
TO CHEF GORDON THAT WE CAN
ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING RIGHT.

31:40.894 --> 31:43.797
AND ALTHOUGH THERE'S EXCITEMENT
IN THE AIR,

31:43.830 --> 31:45.941
SEBASTIAN IS FEELING ONE THING
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

31:45.941 --> 31:47.134
SEBASTIAN IS FEELING ONE THING
MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE.

31:47.167 --> 31:49.169
WHERE'S SEBASTIAN?

31:49.202 --> 31:50.637
PRESSURE.

31:50.670 --> 31:51.371
THIS IS RIDICULOUS.

31:51.404 --> 31:53.106
SEBASTIAN.

31:53.140 --> 31:55.942
EXCUSE ME, SIR.

31:55.976 --> 31:58.345
OKAY,
TWO SECONDS WITH ME.

31:58.378 --> 32:01.181
CONTROL IT, WHETHER YOU'RE
RUNNING THE PIZZA SIDE,

32:01.214 --> 32:03.016
OR WHETHER
ON THE GRILL.

32:03.049 --> 32:04.951
AS THOSE ORDERS COME IN,
PUSH THEM OUT, GET ON TOP OF IT.

32:04.985 --> 32:06.820
AND MAKE SURE
THAT EVERYONE IS NOT

32:06.853 --> 32:08.221
SHOUTING
ACROSS EACH OTHER.

32:08.255 --> 32:09.556
ONE PERSON
CONTROLLING IT.

32:09.589 --> 32:10.624
YES?
OKAY?

32:10.657 --> 32:12.058
ANY QUESTIONS?
NO, SIR.

32:12.092 --> 32:13.293
GOOD.
THANK YOU.

32:13.326 --> 32:14.494
LET'S GO.

32:16.596 --> 32:19.332
ALREADY, THE RESTAURANT
IS BUZZING ABOUT THE NEW MENU.

32:24.371 --> 32:27.207
CAN I HAVE
YOUR ORDER, PLEASE?

32:27.240 --> 32:30.010
OKAY.

32:30.043 --> 32:31.478
YOU'RE GONNA TRY
THE SHRIMP NICKY?
YEAH.

32:31.511 --> 32:32.479
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

32:32.512 --> 32:33.647
SO FAR, EVERYBODY REALLY LIKES
THE NEW MENU.

32:33.680 --> 32:35.549
IT'S REALLY NICE.

32:35.582 --> 32:38.084
AND THE FIRST WAVE OF ORDERS
IS NOW HITTING THE KITCHEN.

32:38.118 --> 32:39.753
I GOT TWO MARGARITAS IN.

32:39.786 --> 32:42.556
OKAY, GOOD.

32:42.589 --> 32:44.691
TONIGHT, THE PIZZAS
ARE SELLING GREAT.

32:44.724 --> 32:45.941
THESE SHRIMP NICKIES
ARE GOING LIKE CRAZY.

32:45.941 --> 32:46.126
THESE SHRIMP NICKIES
ARE GOING LIKE CRAZY.

32:46.159 --> 32:48.161
LIKE CRAZY.

32:48.195 --> 32:49.930
THE MARGARITA, THE SALMON,
AND THE SLAW?

32:49.963 --> 32:51.298
SELL IT, SELL IT.

32:51.331 --> 32:52.532
AN HOUR INTO SERVICE,

32:52.566 --> 32:54.067
AND THE NEW, SIMPLIFIED MENU

32:54.100 --> 32:56.369
IS ENABLING THE KITCHEN
TO RUN SMOOTHLY.

32:56.403 --> 32:58.939
AND THE ORDERS ARE GETTING OUT
IN GOOD TIME.

32:58.972 --> 33:01.374
THIS HAS GOT RICOTTA CHEESE,
MOZZARELLA CHEESE, AND SPINACH.

33:01.408 --> 33:06.213
KEEP IN MIND ALL THE DOUGH
IS ALL HOMEMADE.

33:06.246 --> 33:08.114
ENJOY.
I HOPE YOU LIKE IT.

33:08.148 --> 33:10.016
AND GORDON'S NEW
MADE-TO-ORDER ENTREES

33:10.050 --> 33:11.051
ARE IMPRESSING THE CUSTOMERS.

33:14.187 --> 33:15.789
THE NIGHT IS GOING VERY WELL.

33:15.822 --> 33:15.941
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE ENJOYING THE NEW FOOD

33:15.941 --> 33:17.424
A LOT OF PEOPLE
ARE ENJOYING THE NEW FOOD

33:17.457 --> 33:20.227
'CAUSE THEY THINK
IT'S REALLY FRESH.

33:20.260 --> 33:21.361
MUCH BETTER.

33:21.394 --> 33:22.796
MUCH, MUCH BETTER.

33:22.829 --> 33:25.031
BUT INSTEAD OF BEING HAPPY,

33:25.065 --> 33:26.533
SEBASTIAN IS STILL DISTURBED

33:26.566 --> 33:28.168
OVER THE MENU CHANGE.

33:31.271 --> 33:32.806
HEY, LOOK AT THAT.

33:32.839 --> 33:36.209
YEAH? AND THINK
FROZEN MASHED POTATOES.

33:36.243 --> 33:37.544
BOLLOCKS.

33:43.516 --> 33:45.151
I WANNA TRY TO GO BACK

33:45.185 --> 33:45.941
TO ALL THOSE 20 FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

33:45.941 --> 33:47.354
TO ALL THOSE 20 FLAVOR
COMBINATIONS.

33:47.387 --> 33:50.056
THERE'S A LOT OF UNIQUENESS
WITH THE MENU I WAS USING.

33:50.090 --> 33:52.425
WHETHER HE THOUGHT IT
WAS GOOD FOOD OR BAD FOOD,

33:52.459 --> 33:54.060
IT WAS UNIQUE.

33:54.094 --> 33:56.863
SEBASTIAN STILL DOESN'T
FULLY SUPPORT

33:56.896 --> 33:58.765
GORDON'S MANDATE
FOR FRESHNESS.

33:58.798 --> 34:00.934
THIS IS GONE.
THIS IS GONE.

34:00.967 --> 34:03.103
GOTTA PULL THEM TICKETS.

34:03.136 --> 34:05.138
AND BEFORE THE NIGHT IS OVER,

34:05.171 --> 34:07.974
THE MICROWAVE IS BACK IN ACTION.

34:08.008 --> 34:12.612
MAKE ME A PRIMAVERA.

34:12.646 --> 34:14.447
ALL RIGHT?

34:14.481 --> 34:15.941
A PRIMAVERA, AN ANTIPASTI,
AND ANOTHER PITTSBURG.

34:15.941 --> 34:17.784
A PRIMAVERA, AN ANTIPASTI,
AND ANOTHER PITTSBURG.

34:19.819 --> 34:23.423
I NEED TO KNOW WHAT SEBASTIAN
DID HERE 'CAUSE THIS IS A MESS.

34:23.456 --> 34:26.426
UNFORTUNATELY,
SEBASTIAN'S REVERSION

34:26.459 --> 34:29.329
TO HIS OLD MENU HAS CAUSED
CONFUSION IN THE KITCHEN.

34:29.362 --> 34:31.197
I NEED THIS FOR 35.

34:31.231 --> 34:33.233
WAS THAT 35 WHAT YOU JUST SENT
OUT RIGHT THERE?

34:33.266 --> 34:35.402
NO, THIS IS TABLE THREE,
AND--
NO, I THINK

34:35.435 --> 34:38.071
IT'S THE SAME.
ERIKA.

34:38.104 --> 34:39.706
GET HER, GET HER, GET HER.
I NEED THAT SANDWICH.

34:43.343 --> 34:44.811
OKAY.

34:44.844 --> 34:45.941
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
FROM A SERVER'S STANDPOINT,

34:45.941 --> 34:46.780
I CAN ONLY TELL YOU
FROM A SERVER'S STANDPOINT,

34:46.813 --> 34:47.914
IT WAS ALMOST
LIKE A DOMINO EFFECT.

34:47.947 --> 34:49.416
ONCE ONE THING STARTED
HAPPENING,

34:49.449 --> 34:51.451
THEN ANOTHER, THEN ANOTHER.

34:51.484 --> 34:52.519
HEY, SEBASTIAN.

34:52.552 --> 34:54.054
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW.

34:54.087 --> 34:55.221
WE'RE GONNA NEED
SOME HELP OVER HERE.

34:58.124 --> 35:00.226
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED,
IT GOES

35:05.732 --> 35:06.900
YEAH, YEAH.

35:06.933 --> 35:08.501
THE SCAMPI IS GONE
FOR TABLE NINE.

35:08.535 --> 35:10.203
I HANDED IT RIGHT THERE.

35:10.236 --> 35:11.871
WE STARTED USING THE OLD MENU,

35:11.905 --> 35:15.542
AND THERE WAS SO MUCH CONFUSION
IN THE KITCHEN.

35:15.575 --> 35:15.941
SO YOU'RE SERVING THE OLD MENU NOW?
YEAH.

35:15.941 --> 35:17.610
SO YOU'RE SERVING THE OLD MENU NOW?
YEAH.

35:17.644 --> 35:19.412
I LOVE THE NEW MENU,

35:19.446 --> 35:21.614
BUT THE ORIGINAL CONCEPT
OF SEBASTIAN'S,

35:21.648 --> 35:23.883
THE 20 FLAVOR COMBINATIONS,

35:23.917 --> 35:25.418
I'LL NEVER LOSE THAT.

35:25.452 --> 35:26.853
NO  WAY WE'RE SERVING
THE OLD MENU.

35:26.886 --> 35:28.288
ME.

35:28.321 --> 35:30.724
LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING
FROM A DOG'S DINNER.

35:30.757 --> 35:32.392
NO  WAY.

35:32.425 --> 35:33.993
NO, NO, NO.

35:34.027 --> 35:36.262
NO, I JUST WANTED TO KNOW WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN IF I WASN'T HERE.

35:36.296 --> 35:37.797
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

35:37.831 --> 35:39.566
YOU THINK I'M--
I'M ASKING, YEAH.

35:39.599 --> 35:42.102
DON'T START.
THE STOVE'S COLD.

35:42.135 --> 35:44.371
HERE WE GO.
CUE ACTION, DRAMA.

35:44.404 --> 35:45.638
ME.

35:45.672 --> 35:45.941
WELCOME, GUYS.

35:45.941 --> 35:47.374
WELCOME, GUYS.

35:47.407 --> 35:48.842
I HOPE YOU ENJOY YOUR PIZZA.

35:48.875 --> 35:50.343
OH, DEAR.

35:50.377 --> 35:52.879
IT APPEARS AS THOUGH
SEBASTIAN'S EGO

35:52.912 --> 35:55.248
IS GETTING IN THE WAY
OF HIS POTENTIAL SUCCESS.

35:55.281 --> 35:57.984
AND GORDON'S HAD ENOUGH.

35:58.017 --> 35:59.619
SEBASTIAN,
I NEED A WORD WITH YOU FIRST.

35:59.652 --> 36:02.589
RIGHT.
WITH ME.

36:02.622 --> 36:05.759
HE CAN TALK TO ME
ANY WAY HE WANTS.

36:05.792 --> 36:07.327
BUT WHEN IT COMES DOWN TO IT,
I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

36:07.360 --> 36:08.962
OKAY.

36:08.995 --> 36:10.397
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED HERE,

36:10.430 --> 36:12.565
WE GOT OFF
TO A SHAKY START.

36:12.599 --> 36:15.668
SURE, OH YEAH.

36:15.702 --> 36:15.941
AND THEN WE KEPT
OUR HEADS DOWN,

36:15.941 --> 36:17.237
AND THEN WE KEPT
OUR HEADS DOWN,

36:17.270 --> 36:19.038
AND WE GOT
THROUGH IT TOGETHER.

36:19.072 --> 36:20.373
YES, WE DID.
AND WE..

36:20.407 --> 36:22.242
MADE SOME REALLY
EXCITING CHANGES.

36:22.275 --> 36:23.743
THE MENU'S CHANGED.

36:23.777 --> 36:24.978
THE STAFF HAVE CHANGED.

36:25.011 --> 36:26.446
YES.

36:26.479 --> 36:29.783
MATE, THERE'S ONE THING
THAT HASN'T CHANGED

36:29.816 --> 36:32.352
IN THIS ESTABLISHMENT.

36:32.385 --> 36:33.486
AND THAT'S YOU,

36:33.520 --> 36:36.356
SEBASTIAN.

36:36.389 --> 36:37.690
I'M 40 YEARS OF AGE.

36:37.724 --> 36:39.359
AND I'VE GONE
TO A LOT OF RESTAURANTS.

36:39.392 --> 36:42.228
BUT I'VE NEVER,
EVER, EVER, EVER

36:42.262 --> 36:45.231
EVER MET SOMEONE

36:45.265 --> 36:45.941
I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

36:45.941 --> 36:48.401
I BELIEVE IN
AS LITTLE AS YOU.

36:48.435 --> 36:49.402
I THINK

36:49.436 --> 36:52.372
THAT YOU WILL GO BACK

36:52.405 --> 36:55.909
TO YOUR SLOPPY,
SHORTCUT,

36:55.942 --> 36:59.779
FIVE OUT OF TEN,
FROZEN WAYS.

36:59.813 --> 37:01.915
GOOD LUCK.

37:04.751 --> 37:05.852
UNBELIEVABLE.

37:05.885 --> 37:08.321
UNBELIEVABLE.

37:08.354 --> 37:10.590
- SO  USELESS.
- ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

37:10.623 --> 37:12.826
YOU  KIDDING ME
RIGHT NOW?

37:16.763 --> 37:19.599
THIS IS MY  LIFE.

37:19.632 --> 37:21.134
OH, MY GOD.

37:21.167 --> 37:24.938
THIS IS MY  LIFE.

37:24.971 --> 37:27.140
HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T SEEN
SEBASTIAN THIS EMOTIONAL.

37:27.173 --> 37:30.743
SEBASTIAN JUST GOT REAL LOUD.

37:30.777 --> 37:33.446
HE JUST CHANGED
LIKE DR. JEKYLL TO MR. HYDE.

37:33.480 --> 37:36.416
YOU'RE--

37:36.449 --> 37:39.352
THAT'S PISSED ON HIS BONFIRE.

37:39.385 --> 37:41.154
ARROGANT.

37:43.156 --> 37:44.457
WE'RE DONE.

37:44.491 --> 37:45.941
GET THE  CAMERA
OUTTA HERE.

37:45.941 --> 37:47.093
GET THE  CAMERA
OUTTA HERE.

37:50.163 --> 37:51.998
CHEF GORDON!

37:55.001 --> 37:58.037
CHEF GORDON,
WHERE THE  ARE YOU?

37:58.071 --> 37:59.339
WHERE ARE YOU?

37:59.372 --> 38:01.140
I'M HERE.
YOU COME INTO MY RESTAURANT.

38:01.174 --> 38:03.676
- YES.
- I'M JUST SO  DIS--

38:03.710 --> 38:05.812
DON'T SHOUT.
ARE YOU GONNA CALM DOWN?

38:05.845 --> 38:07.480
OR SHOULD I GET YOU OUT THERE?
STOP POINTING YOUR FINGER AT ME.

38:07.514 --> 38:08.448
YOU'RE GONNA CALM DOWN.
ARE WE GONNA SPEAK LIKE MEN?

38:08.481 --> 38:10.250
ARE YOU GONNA SPEAK
TO ME LIKE A MAN?

38:10.283 --> 38:11.584
YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
TO WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU.

38:11.618 --> 38:13.219
YOU'RE NOT LISTENING
TO WHAT I'M SAYING.

38:13.253 --> 38:14.020
DID YOU JUST HEAR
WHAT I JUST TOLD YOU?

38:14.053 --> 38:15.021
I'M STEPPING AWAY FROM YOU

38:15.054 --> 38:15.941
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANNA BE TOO CLOSE.

38:15.941 --> 38:16.456
BECAUSE I DON'T
WANNA BE TOO CLOSE.

38:16.489 --> 38:17.490
YOU UNGRATEFUL--

38:17.524 --> 38:18.791
WELL, YOU HAVE NO IDEA--

38:18.825 --> 38:19.926
NASTY, VINDICTIVE.

38:19.959 --> 38:20.994
NO  IDEA.

38:21.027 --> 38:21.995
JOKER.

38:22.028 --> 38:23.229
YOU.
THAT'S IT, IS IT?

38:23.263 --> 38:24.297
YEAH, IT IS IT.

38:24.330 --> 38:25.899
YOU'RE VERY DISAPPOINTING.

38:25.932 --> 38:27.333
THAT'S YOUR SECOND
PERFORMANCE TONIGHT.

38:27.367 --> 38:28.668
ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

38:28.701 --> 38:30.870
- YOUR WHOLE ACT IS A  JOKE.
-  ANYTHING ELSE?

38:30.904 --> 38:32.906
YOUR WHOLE ACT IS
A  JOKE, YOU'RE A PHONY.

38:32.939 --> 38:34.674
YOU SHOULDN'T RUN LIKE THAT.
RUN LIKE WHAT?

38:34.707 --> 38:36.876
AM I SUPPOSED
TO BE SCARED NOW, SEBASTIAN?

38:36.910 --> 38:38.745
COME ON,
GIVE ME A BREAK.

38:38.778 --> 38:40.046
I BUSTED MY ASS IN THERE,
YOU TELL ME--
YOU WHAT?

38:40.079 --> 38:41.648
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

38:41.681 --> 38:43.783
LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING.
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

38:43.816 --> 38:45.084
LET ME JUST TELL YOU SOMETHING.
YOU AIN'T TELLING ME NOTHING.

38:45.118 --> 38:45.852
I'M DONE, I'M DONE.
SEE, THERE YOU GO.

38:45.885 --> 38:45.941
YOU GET YOUR--
LOSER.

38:45.941 --> 38:47.487
YOU GET YOUR--
LOSER.

38:47.520 --> 38:49.255
I'M TELLING YOU ONE LAST TIME.

38:49.289 --> 38:50.790
YOU'RE A.

38:58.633 --> 38:59.834
LOSER.

38:59.867 --> 39:01.502
I'M TELLING YOU ONE LAST TIME.

39:01.535 --> 39:03.304
YOU'RE A.

39:03.337 --> 39:05.306
WHILE SEBASTIAN
LETS OFF STEAM OUTSIDE,

39:05.339 --> 39:09.977
INSIDE, THE KITCHEN
HAS COME TO A HALT.

39:10.011 --> 39:13.347
GORDON HAS PUT IN
ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT

39:13.381 --> 39:14.982
INTO SEBASTIAN'S.

39:15.016 --> 39:16.317
HE HAS ALSO BEEN IMPRESSED
BY THE STAFF'S WILLINGNESS

39:16.350 --> 39:17.518
TO CHANGE.

39:17.551 --> 39:18.919
THEY LOOK LOVELY,
DON'T THEY?

39:18.953 --> 39:19.754
HUH?
TASTES LOVELY.

39:19.787 --> 39:23.224
ARE THEY GOING OUT NOW?

39:23.257 --> 39:25.366
WOW, IT'S HARD TO HEAR

39:25.366 --> 39:26.527
WOW, IT'S HARD TO HEAR

39:26.560 --> 39:30.398
THAT WHAT YOU'VE DONE
IS A FAILURE.

39:30.431 --> 39:32.333
COME ON, GUYS.
SALMON AND CHICKEN AWAY, YEAH?

39:32.366 --> 39:34.302
ROASTED VEGETABLES.
LET'S GO.

39:34.335 --> 39:36.237
IT'S TRUE SOME
OF THE STUFF HE SAYS.

39:36.270 --> 39:38.873
MAYBE I WAS A LITTLE TWISTED
WITH MY IDEAS

39:38.906 --> 39:40.074
AND MY GOALS.

39:40.107 --> 39:42.443
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS,

39:42.476 --> 39:44.679
THEN I GUESS
IT LOOKS LIKE I'M FAILING.

39:44.712 --> 39:46.514
OKAY.
READY?

39:46.547 --> 39:47.815
HAPPY?
LITTLE SLICE OF LEMON.

39:47.848 --> 39:49.016
KNIFE, PLEASE.

39:49.050 --> 39:50.551
IT'S A SLAP OF REALITY.

39:50.584 --> 39:51.652
AND I KNOW HE'S RIGHT.

39:51.686 --> 39:54.488
IT'S NOT EASY TO ACCEPT.

39:57.158 --> 40:00.294
BUT I GUESS BEFORE YOU GROW,
YOU GOTTA ACCEPT IT.

40:00.328 --> 40:03.097
KEEP THEM IN THERE, GET THEM
NICE AND... YEAH?

40:04.365 --> 40:07.368
IT'S MY FAMILY,
MY KIDS,

40:07.401 --> 40:09.737
MAKES YOU WANNA
WORK HARDER.

40:09.770 --> 40:10.905
LET'S GO.
WHAT'S NEXT?

40:10.938 --> 40:11.972
Q, TALK TO ME,
BIG BOY.

40:12.006 --> 40:14.041
SHRIMP, YEAH?
GOOD.

40:14.075 --> 40:17.545
I DON'T HAVE THE DEGREE.
I DIDN'T GO TO SCHOOL.

40:17.578 --> 40:19.513
I KNOW I'VE GOT TALENT.

40:19.547 --> 40:21.582
I'M A DAMN GOOD COOK.

40:21.615 --> 40:23.184
I'M NOT GIVING UP.

40:23.217 --> 40:25.366
I'LL GET THERE.
I'LL GET THERE.

40:25.366 --> 40:26.187
I'LL GET THERE.
I'LL GET THERE.

40:29.156 --> 40:36.797
*

40:36.831 --> 40:38.632
EVERYONE'S JUST KINDA LOOKING
AROUND, AND...

40:38.666 --> 40:39.800
WE DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

40:43.938 --> 40:46.340
I WAS SPEECHLESS.

40:46.374 --> 40:48.843
I COULDN'T EVEN TELL YOU
HOW WORRIED I WAS

40:48.876 --> 40:52.079
'CAUSE HE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
THIS BIG BAD GUY, RIGHT?

40:52.113 --> 40:54.515
I COULD FEEL HIM WATCHING ME.

40:54.548 --> 40:55.366
I FELT LIKE HE WOULD'VE SAID,

40:55.366 --> 40:56.283
I FELT LIKE HE WOULD'VE SAID,

40:56.317 --> 40:57.785
"WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
ABOUT YOUR KITCHEN?

40:57.818 --> 40:58.986
IT'S FALLING APART."

40:59.019 --> 41:01.922
I'M LIKE, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I GOTTA FIX THIS.

41:01.956 --> 41:04.291
HOW WE LOOKIN'?

41:04.325 --> 41:05.860
ARE WE BACK ON TOP NOW?
OH YES, CHEF.

41:05.893 --> 41:06.827
WE ARE, YEAH?

41:06.861 --> 41:08.129
YEAH.
ON POINT, CHEF.

41:08.162 --> 41:09.130
NOT CONFUSED NOW?
NO, SIR.

41:09.163 --> 41:10.965
GOOD.

41:10.998 --> 41:12.767
ORDER UP.

41:12.800 --> 41:14.668
SEBASTIAN JUST CAME IN
AND HE WAS READY TO GO.

41:14.702 --> 41:16.637
GIVE ME A LARGE CROSTINI.
I GOT YOU.

41:16.670 --> 41:18.139
ABSOLUTELY PERFECT.

41:18.172 --> 41:20.107
PERFECT, PERFECT.

41:20.141 --> 41:21.942
ONCE THINGS
STARTED GOING SMOOTHLY,

41:21.976 --> 41:23.611
SEBASTIAN SEEMED TO BE
A LOT MORE OPTIMISTIC.

41:23.644 --> 41:25.212
GET A LITTLE EXCITED
IN HERE, SEBASTIAN.

41:25.246 --> 41:25.366
I APPRECIATE
THE ENTHUSIASM.

41:25.366 --> 41:26.647
I APPRECIATE
THE ENTHUSIASM.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.151
THE FACT I'VE GOT A ONE
IN A MILLION OPPORTUNITY HERE,

41:30.184 --> 41:32.319
I'D BE A FOOL NOT TO ACCEPT IT.

41:32.353 --> 41:33.654
TABLE EIGHT.
SEND IT OUT.

41:33.687 --> 41:35.890
LET'S GO.

41:35.923 --> 41:37.091
SALMON'S GONE.
YES.

41:37.124 --> 41:38.592
TABLE 11.
LET'S GO.

41:38.626 --> 41:39.794
ORDER UP, ORDER UP.

41:39.827 --> 41:40.594
I NEED A SALAD ON THE FLY.

41:40.628 --> 41:42.096
TABLE NINE.

41:42.129 --> 41:43.497
WITH SEBASTIAN
BACK IN THE SADDLE,

41:43.531 --> 41:44.932
THE STAFF RALLIES TOGETHER

41:44.965 --> 41:46.834
AND TURNS THE KITCHEN AROUND.

41:46.867 --> 41:48.269
SERVICE HAS STEPPED UP.

41:48.302 --> 41:50.037
FOOD IS GOING OUT ON TIME.

41:50.070 --> 41:52.072
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY,

41:52.106 --> 41:53.374
THE CUSTOMERS ARE HAPPY.

41:59.380 --> 42:00.514
BLOODY WELL DONE.

42:00.548 --> 42:02.183
YOU TOOK ON THE CHANGES WELL.

42:02.216 --> 42:03.984
YOU ALL ADAPTED.

42:04.018 --> 42:06.620
CHANGE IS A CHALLENGE.
IT'S HARD.

42:06.654 --> 42:08.589
BUT I THINK IT'LL BE WORTH IT
IN THE LONG RUN.

42:08.622 --> 42:11.792
IT'S EVERYTHING
THAT WE'VE WORKED FOR.

42:11.826 --> 42:14.428
LOU, YOUR ENTHUSIASM
IS INFECTIOUS.

42:14.462 --> 42:16.063
YOU KNOW THAT.

42:16.096 --> 42:18.232
COMING FROM CHEF GORDON, IT MADE
ME FEEL REALLY GOOD TO KNOW

42:18.265 --> 42:20.534
THAT HE SAW THAT IN ME,
SO THAT WAS COOL.

42:20.568 --> 42:22.770
ANDRE.
HAPPY?

42:22.803 --> 42:24.004
VERY.
YES?

42:24.038 --> 42:25.366
YES.
YEAH, WE STARTED OFF SLOW,

42:25.366 --> 42:25.539
YES.
YEAH, WE STARTED OFF SLOW,

42:25.573 --> 42:27.608
BUT HEY,
WE DIDN'T CRUMBLE, DID WE?

42:27.641 --> 42:29.810
WE GOT MORE ADJUSTED
TO THE MENU.

42:29.844 --> 42:33.080
AND THINGS STARTED WORKING A LOT
MORE SMOOTHLY FOR US.

42:33.113 --> 42:35.749
TOMORROW, IT STARTS AGAIN.

42:35.783 --> 42:37.451
YES?

42:37.485 --> 42:38.619
WELL DONE.

42:38.652 --> 42:40.821
YES.

42:41.889 --> 42:43.390
VERY GOOD.

42:45.759 --> 42:47.495
I RESPECTED CHEF
WHEN HE CAME IN,

42:47.528 --> 42:49.897
MY OPINION CHANGED OF HIM
WHEN I MET HIM,

42:49.930 --> 42:53.400
AND HE'S REITERATED TO ME

42:53.434 --> 42:55.366
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HIS METHODS.

42:55.366 --> 42:56.770
I DON'T HAVE TO AGREE
WITH HIS METHODS.

42:56.804 --> 42:58.539
THE RESULTS IS WHAT IT IS.

42:58.572 --> 43:01.609
AS I LEAVE SEBASTIAN'S,
I HAVE A LOT OF MIXED FEELINGS.

43:01.642 --> 43:03.878
I REALLY KNOW THIS RESTAURANT
CAN BE A BIG SUCCESS,

43:03.911 --> 43:05.813
BUT I ALSO FEEL SEBASTIAN
HAS VERY LITTLE INTEREST

43:05.846 --> 43:07.515
IN STICKING TO THE NEW PLAN.
