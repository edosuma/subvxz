the start of something new.

Spike's dad took our older kids
to the tournament, and Spike

01:39.183 --> 01:41.817
and I planned this treasure
hunt for the Super Monsters.

01:41.900 --> 01:44.730
We hid sparklies
all over the park.

Come on, Mom, we still have
to hide the rest of them!

01:48.370 --> 01:51.570
I'm hiding the sparklies
for the Super Monsters who fly.

And I'm hiding them
for everyone else.

Say, Spike, would you like me
to hide some of the sparklies?

01:59.578 --> 02:02.748

they are, you can play too.

No, thank you, Igor.
I don't mind not playing.

is the best part!

02:13.612 --> 02:14.613
All done!

Perfect timing, look!

12:58.103 --> 13:00.110
On the first night of spring?

13:00.555 --> 13:01.555
I wonder if...

13:01.907 --> 13:04.597
Oh, wouldn't that be something?

13:04.680 --> 13:05.760
[Sammy giggles]

13:05.960 --> 13:07.282
Hello, Mrs. Snow!

13:07.788 --> 13:09.585
Hello, Sammy!

13:10.248 --> 13:14.155
Sammy, why don't you come with me
while your mommy gets something to eat?

13:14.238 --> 13:15.783
Have fun, cutie pie!

13:16.838 --> 13:19.175
[all]
Oh, Sammy!

13:19.800 --> 13:21.378
[Sammy giggles]

13:23.050 --> 13:24.728
[Sammy gasps]

13:27.348 --> 13:31.395
Sammy! I've been working
on a new magic trick, just for you.

13:31.978 --> 13:33.580
[Sammy babbles]

13:34.142 --> 13:37.008
Watch me pull a bunch
of snow flowers out of my hat!

13:37.483 --> 13:39.968
Abra-Kada-- What?

-[Wingoats bleat]

13:50.958 --> 13:51.958
Oh, bats!

13:54.293 --> 13:57.730
I'll let Dr. Jekyll know that
Bubble and Trouble are over here.

13:58.338 --> 13:59.352
[Momo squeaks]

13:59.435 --> 14:03.363
You're right. Those Wingoats
really love making mischief.

14:03.635 --> 14:04.935
Just like you.

14:08.133 --> 14:09.133
Stop that!

14:09.942 --> 14:10.942
Leave that!

14:12.103 --> 14:13.103
[goats bleat]

14:13.478 --> 14:14.980
[Abuelita]
Don't eat that!

14:18.400 --> 14:22.195
Those little Wingoats are
the silliest things I've seen!

14:23.155 --> 14:25.115
[neighbor]
Hello, happy spring!

14:25.490 --> 14:27.233
[Katya giggles]

14:27.743 --> 14:31.330
Mom, look! Henri
and I found five sparklies!

14:31.628 --> 14:33.315
That's wonderful, Katya.

14:33.915 --> 14:36.502
Henri is really good
at spotting the sparklies.

14:37.430 --> 14:40.920
Henri, I had no idea you were
so good at treasure hunting!

14:41.340 --> 14:43.788
[Henri meows and purrs]

14:44.303 --> 14:46.577
[Momo teases Henri]

14:46.988 --> 14:48.887
Momo, stop teasing Henri.

14:49.137 --> 14:51.278
[Henri meows]

14:51.642 --> 14:52.727
[Momo teases Henri]

[Katya and Ms. Spelling giggle]

14:56.020 --> 14:57.220
[background music]

14:59.447 --> 15:01.448
Hello, Amy! Hi, Katya!

15:01.915 --> 15:02.915
Hello!

15:03.115 --> 15:04.383
Hi, Dr. Jekyll!

15:05.720 --> 15:07.765
Hello, Henri.

15:08.385 --> 15:09.625
Hi, Momo.

15:28.628 --> 15:29.828
[background music]

15:34.680 --> 15:35.680
Ready?

15:37.248 --> 15:38.383
[Griffy chirping]

15:43.267 --> 15:44.267
[Griffy chirping]

15:44.487 --> 15:46.822
It's OK, Griffy, you can do this.

15:48.837 --> 15:49.837
Ready?

15:50.988 --> 15:51.988
[Griffy chirping]

15:54.508 --> 15:56.555
Wow, Griffy, look at you!

15:56.875 --> 15:58.860
You're getting so good
at flying!

15:59.418 --> 16:01.220
[Griffy chirping]

16:03.963 --> 16:04.963
[Henri meows]

16:05.388 --> 16:07.407
Cleo, you're a really
good teacher.

16:08.010 --> 16:11.763
Thanks, Katya. Helping Griffy
is my favorite thing ever.

16:12.095 --> 16:13.095
[Henri meows]

16:14.057 --> 16:18.270
I think hunting for sparklies
is Henri's favorite thing ever.

16:18.603 --> 16:20.147
[Katya and Cleo chuckling]

16:20.293 --> 16:23.138
And he really wants
to win that prize.

16:23.608 --> 16:24.608
[Griffy chirps]

16:25.318 --> 16:27.278
You want to play to? OK.

16:27.697 --> 16:29.238
Let's go look for sparklies!

16:33.325 --> 16:34.325
[Frankie grunting]

16:37.073 --> 16:39.605
[Glorb squeaking]

16:40.708 --> 16:43.003
Sorry, Glorb.
That's not a dragon sparkly.

16:43.595 --> 16:44.595
[Glorb squeaking]

16:45.380 --> 16:47.423
No, it's not a sparkly.

16:47.883 --> 16:49.412
I'm not sure what it is.

16:49.968 --> 16:50.968
May I take a look?

16:54.948 --> 16:56.080
[Glorb squeaking]

16:58.518 --> 17:00.270
[Lobo]
I'll get it, fast, fast!

17:02.893 --> 17:04.422
[Lobo howling]

17:10.093 --> 17:11.593
Oh, sorry, Molasses.

17:11.948 --> 17:15.632
I'm not supposed to grab things
out of people's hands, or paws.

17:16.328 --> 17:18.413
-[Molasses squeaking]
-May I have that?

17:19.863 --> 17:21.224
Not going to grab.

17:21.792 --> 17:23.833
May I, may I, may I?

17:25.698 --> 17:27.560
Going to wait.

17:28.180 --> 17:29.180
[Ms. Spelling laughs]

17:31.893 --> 17:32.893
[Lobo sighs]

17:39.017 --> 17:40.018
Huh?

17:41.773 --> 17:43.153
Oh!

17:47.985 --> 17:49.402
[Lobo giggles]
Thanks, buddy!

17:49.487 --> 17:51.028
-Oh, it's OK.
-[Molasses gasps]

17:51.155 --> 17:52.155
I got you!

17:53.167 --> 17:55.738
Wow! Awesome!

17:58.328 --> 17:59.328
Wow!

18:00.623 --> 18:01.723
Lobo!

18:02.958 --> 18:05.918
He found his furever friend!

18:06.878 --> 18:07.878
[everyone cheering]

18:10.090 --> 18:12.828
Oh, goodness!
What just happened?

18:13.513 --> 18:15.610
Lobo just made a monster match!

18:16.020 --> 18:17.953
What's a monster match?

18:18.390 --> 18:21.905
That's what happens when
a monster finds a monster pet

18:22.078 --> 18:23.818
to be their furever friend.

18:24.110 --> 18:27.485
When a monster pet finds
their one true monster,

18:27.688 --> 18:30.175
they create a magical bond.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.988
[Igor] They both get
a lifetime of love.

18:33.197 --> 18:37.742
[Igor] And their monster gets special
super-powers too.

18:37.952 --> 18:39.243
[Lobo howling]

18:40.703 --> 18:41.955
[Lobo howling]

18:42.413 --> 18:45.735
[Molasses laughing]

18:46.392 --> 18:47.907
[Lobo howling]

18:49.207 --> 18:50.207
Huh?

18:53.435 --> 18:54.808
Yay!

18:59.648 --> 19:00.648
[Lobo laughs]

19:04.813 --> 19:05.813
[Lobo gasps]

19:07.438 --> 19:08.438
Huh!

19:09.880 --> 19:10.880
Uh-huh!

19:13.403 --> 19:15.778
[Lobo gasps]

19:16.823 --> 19:18.283
Another sparkly!

19:22.578 --> 19:25.110
Wow, this is so awesome!

19:26.953 --> 19:30.735
Did you see that?
Molasses and I slowed time!

19:31.423 --> 19:33.962
[Molasses yawns]

19:35.175 --> 19:38.637
Actually, <i>mijito, </i> you were running
even faster than usual.

19:39.573 --> 19:41.643
No, really, everything
slowed down.

19:42.098 --> 19:44.893
That's how I found three sparklies, see?

19:46.478 --> 19:47.728
[Igor]
Maybe this will help.

19:48.043 --> 19:49.715
I filmed the whole thing.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.567
[camera click]

19:53.848 --> 19:56.637
[Lobo] See? That's when I saw
the yellow sparkly,

19:58.152 --> 19:59.630
and there's me
finding the red one!

19:59.830 --> 20:02.188
Wow, is that really
how fast I was going?

20:02.445 --> 20:07.523
Because it felt so slow!
Really, really slow.

20:08.167 --> 20:10.002
[Igor] Let me show it
in slow motion.

20:12.533 --> 20:13.573
What?

20:16.843 --> 20:18.970
Wow! I thought that jump
took forever!

20:19.218 --> 20:21.972
But even in slow motion,
it's still like super fast!

20:22.263 --> 20:26.665
Making a monster match
with a slow monster is so cool!

20:27.213 --> 20:29.215
-Amazing!
-Super cool!

20:29.665 --> 20:33.090
Most of the furever friends
in my family are kind of small.

20:33.395 --> 20:34.395
And fishy.

20:34.893 --> 20:37.673
My dad's monster match
is an electric eel!

20:38.113 --> 20:42.298
He-he, Shocker is the best buddy
a monster could ever wish for!

20:42.915 --> 20:45.790
Without him, I'd never be able
to do this.

20:46.757 --> 20:48.340
[electrifying buzz]

20:48.540 --> 20:49.570
[everyone gasps]

20:49.653 --> 20:51.883
Now your twinkle lights
are even prettier!

20:52.085 --> 20:53.258
Thanks for lighting them up.

20:53.342 --> 20:55.873
That sure is a super useful
super-power.

20:56.088 --> 20:57.382
Happy to help.

20:57.698 --> 21:00.728
So your furever friend is
an electric eel?

21:01.010 --> 21:02.262
He sure is.

21:02.428 --> 21:05.290
And Shocker helps you control
your monster powers?

21:05.683 --> 21:06.683
He sure does.

21:07.058 --> 21:09.287
Hmm. But, where is he?

21:09.603 --> 21:12.600
Oh, Shocker's at home,
in his fish tank.

21:13.065 --> 21:14.983
Once a monster makes
a monster match,

21:15.233 --> 21:17.317
they can use their new powers
anytime.

21:17.402 --> 21:19.863
Even if their pet isn't
right there with them.

21:20.013 --> 21:21.850
When I get my furever friend,

21:22.157 --> 21:25.535
I hope I get a cool
power upgrade, like my dad's.

21:25.910 --> 21:28.330
That would be exciting,
wouldn't it, Frankie?

21:28.580 --> 21:30.633
Oh, maybe it'll happen tonight,

21:31.040 --> 21:32.658
just like Lobo and Molasses.

21:33.335 --> 21:35.962
Frankie, honey, you shouldn't
get your hopes up.

21:36.170 --> 21:40.568
It's unusual for someone as young
as Lobo to make a monster match.

21:41.008 --> 21:44.303
But... But Lobo just got
his monster pet.

21:44.638 --> 21:48.455
And Katya and Henri were matched
when she was smaller than Sammy.

21:51.645 --> 21:53.310
That's right, Sammy Lammy.

21:53.675 --> 21:56.840
Katya was younger than you
when a tiny blue kitten

21:57.042 --> 21:59.645
hopped right into her playpen.

22:00.195 --> 22:02.988
And he's been helping her
with her magic ever since.

22:03.198 --> 22:06.858
See? A monster match
could happen anytime.

22:07.478 --> 22:08.812
Any time.

22:09.398 --> 22:12.913
You know, Frankie? I didn't find
mine until I was a grown-up.

22:13.743 --> 22:14.743
[Momo squeaking]

22:15.243 --> 22:16.687
But now, I have Momo.

22:17.253 --> 22:19.630
And she was definitely
worth waiting for.

22:20.598 --> 22:22.770
Your monster match is a mouse?

22:23.135 --> 22:25.095
I thought all witches had cats!

22:25.678 --> 22:27.472
Witches are just like
other monsters.

22:27.638 --> 22:30.183
We can be paired with almost
any kind of pet.

22:30.390 --> 22:33.312
That's what makes
monster matches so wonderful.

22:33.813 --> 22:35.863
You never know how
it will happen.

22:36.440 --> 22:38.798
You never know how
your monster pet's magic

22:38.882 --> 22:40.673
will change your super-powers.

22:40.882 --> 22:44.090
And you never now when
it can happen to you.

22:44.488 --> 22:47.625
Zoe is right. You never know
when it could happen.

22:47.943 --> 22:51.203
So that means my monster match
could happen at any time!

22:51.778 --> 22:53.115
Anytime!

22:54.123 --> 22:55.443
It could happen tonight!

22:55.958 --> 22:59.128
A monster match would
be super fun!

22:59.513 --> 23:00.515
It would!

23:00.725 --> 23:02.568
But, other things are fun too.

23:05.053 --> 23:06.342
Like magic tricks.

23:06.720 --> 23:07.803
And flying lessons.

23:08.258 --> 23:09.258
[Griffy squeaking]

23:09.638 --> 23:11.433
And looking for dragon sparklies!

23:11.953 --> 23:14.475
And winning the treasure hunt!

23:14.770 --> 23:17.238
-I'm going to win!
-We are going to win!

23:17.798 --> 23:19.458
We are going to win.

23:19.828 --> 23:22.083
No, I'm going to win.

23:23.968 --> 23:26.367
[everyone cheering]

23:27.413 --> 23:30.382
Hmm, maybe there's a sparkly
over here.

23:31.243 --> 23:33.163
You're getting warm.

23:35.040 --> 23:36.040
Warmer.

23:36.542 --> 23:37.917
[Zoe laughs]
This way?

23:38.543 --> 23:40.865
Warm, hot, hotter.

23:43.133 --> 23:44.133
-Huh?
-Cold.

23:44.382 --> 23:45.385
Colder.

23:45.468 --> 23:46.802
[Spike]
Really, really cold.

23:47.133 --> 23:49.128
-[Spike] Freezing!
-Spike, look!

23:49.428 --> 23:51.515
[Zoe] There's a new pony
on the carrousel.

23:51.598 --> 23:52.598
Cool!

23:53.467 --> 23:54.817
It's a unicorn.

23:55.018 --> 23:56.848
I don't think so.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.623
Unicorns are really pretty.

23:58.825 --> 24:01.503
With rainbow manes,
and rainbow tails.

24:02.108 --> 24:04.835
That pony is all gray.
Kind of ugly.

24:05.195 --> 24:06.195
[pony neighs]

24:06.838 --> 24:08.953
-Oh!
-What? It's real!

24:09.153 --> 24:10.383
She's real.

24:10.913 --> 24:12.913
Hello.
[Zoe neighs]

24:13.573 --> 24:16.253
Zoe. You speak unicorn?

24:16.653 --> 24:18.917
Uh-huh, everyone in my family
speaks pony.

24:19.542 --> 24:21.962
But sometimes, we have trouble
with the accents.

24:22.212 --> 24:24.923
[Zoe neighs]
Hello, little unicorn.

24:25.132 --> 24:26.552
We didn't mean to upset you.

24:26.635 --> 24:28.635
-[unicorn neighs]
-My name is Zoe.

24:28.938 --> 24:29.938
And this is Spike.

24:30.402 --> 24:32.268
Hello. What's your name?

24:32.513 --> 24:34.615
And what are you doing
on the carrousel?

24:34.698 --> 24:36.602
[unicorn neighs]

24:37.195 --> 24:40.063
[Zoe neighs]

24:40.897 --> 24:44.025
-[unicorn neighs]
-What did she say?

24:44.898 --> 24:47.303
She says her name is Luna.

24:47.798 --> 24:49.585
-Hi, Luna.
-[Luna neighs]

24:50.282 --> 24:52.817
Luna says she was hiding
here on the merry-go-round

24:52.900 --> 24:55.493
because she isn't pretty
like the other unicorns.

24:55.787 --> 24:58.190
And she doesn't have
their rainbow magic either.

24:58.290 --> 25:00.000
-[Luna neighs]
-I'm sorry, Luna.

25:00.125 --> 25:02.032
I didn't mean
to hurt your feelings.

25:02.418 --> 25:03.417
[Luna neighs]

25:03.500 --> 25:05.805
Luna says she accepts
your apology.

25:06.378 --> 25:07.378
[Luna neighs]

25:08.000 --> 25:10.157
Maybe Zoe could paint you
rainbow colors.

25:10.392 --> 25:12.173
She's a really good painter.

25:12.373 --> 25:13.843
[Luna neighs]

25:14.358 --> 25:16.577
Well, I don't think paint
would work.

25:16.888 --> 25:18.108
-Oh.
-[Luna neighs]

25:18.352 --> 25:21.062
But I do have an idea that might
help you feel better.

25:21.145 --> 25:22.443
To the art supplies!

25:24.128 --> 25:27.045
[Luna neighs]

25:31.990 --> 25:33.072
[Zoe giggles]

25:33.157 --> 25:36.035
I was telling Luna that she's
welcome to stay and play.

25:36.118 --> 25:38.788
But someone needs to tell
her family that she's OK.

25:39.278 --> 25:41.170
I'm sure they must be
very worried.

25:41.963 --> 25:43.745
[Luna neighs]

25:44.608 --> 25:47.690
I can see that Zoe has something
special planned for you.

25:48.340 --> 25:51.008
So why don't I let the other
unicorns know you're safe?

25:51.175 --> 25:53.762
Daddy, do you know where
Luna's family lives?

25:53.970 --> 25:56.347
I think so, it's the grove of pine trees.

25:56.765 --> 25:59.475
[neighs]

25:59.788 --> 26:02.515
-Right?
-[Luna neighs]

26:02.937 --> 26:04.940
[neighs]
Got it!

26:05.290 --> 26:06.438
[Zoe chuckles]

26:06.650 --> 26:08.902
OK, you two. Have fun.

26:10.113 --> 26:11.972
I'll be back in a little bit.

26:14.573 --> 26:16.575
-[Luna neighs]
-[Zoe struggles]

26:18.370 --> 26:19.370
[Zoe laughs]

26:22.165 --> 26:24.362
You know? I think it's possible
there might be

26:24.445 --> 26:26.640
another monster match tonight.

26:28.658 --> 26:30.577
Do you mean Cleo and Griffy?

26:30.988 --> 26:34.815
I do. Cleo's been helping Griffy
with his flying lessons for weeks.

26:35.017 --> 26:37.675
She's so good with him.
And he adores her.

26:38.013 --> 26:41.553
Cleo would love to have
her very own monster pet.

26:42.053 --> 26:45.045
But, you know? Most mummies
never make a monster match.

26:45.530 --> 26:48.443
Well, even if they aren't
destined for a monster match,

26:48.650 --> 26:50.735
I know Cleo and Griffy will always

26:50.957 --> 26:53.080
have a very special friendship.

26:53.553 --> 26:56.643
-You found one!
-[Griffy squeaks]

26:58.933 --> 27:01.708
-Great job, Griffy!
-[Griffy squeaks]

27:02.455 --> 27:05.125
-You want to try going higher?
-[Griffy squeaks]

27:05.458 --> 27:07.335
OK, here you go.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.640
[Griffy squeaking]

27:12.108 --> 27:13.108
There you go!

27:13.583 --> 27:16.528
You're doing great.
You've got this!

27:17.888 --> 27:19.170
Look at him go!

27:19.412 --> 27:23.090
-[Griffy purrs]
-[Drac] Come back here!

27:23.697 --> 27:24.697
[Drac gasps]

27:24.898 --> 27:26.517
[Griffy falls]

27:26.980 --> 27:28.173
Oh, no!

27:28.975 --> 27:29.975
[Cleo gasps]

27:30.873 --> 27:31.873
[Lobo pants]

27:33.235 --> 27:35.148
[Griffy struggles]

27:35.947 --> 27:37.147
[background music]

27:45.498 --> 27:47.875
It's OK, Griffy. I got you.

27:49.922 --> 27:50.933
Huh?

27:51.587 --> 27:53.965
[background music]

27:54.250 --> 27:55.250
Wow!

27:57.440 --> 27:58.963
[Lobo and Dr. Jekyll cheer]

27:59.760 --> 28:00.970
Alright!

28:04.475 --> 28:05.602
Woo-hoo!

28:06.555 --> 28:07.680
Huh?

28:09.438 --> 28:11.482
-[Cleo laughs]
-[Griffy purrs]

28:12.305 --> 28:15.227
Wow! Huh? Awesome!

28:16.113 --> 28:19.363
Come on, Griffy, let's fly!

28:22.577 --> 28:25.065
A flying hat?

28:25.148 --> 28:26.873
Oh, great trick, Drac.

28:27.248 --> 28:29.792
It's not a magic trick,
it's the Wingoats.

28:35.047 --> 28:38.383
[Count Dracula laughs] Those
little Wingoats are hilarious.

28:39.218 --> 28:40.887
[Drac]
Come back here!

28:43.683 --> 28:45.553
[Drac grunts]

28:45.973 --> 28:46.973
[Wing Goats bleat]

28:48.980 --> 28:49.980
I got you!

28:52.273 --> 28:53.775
[background music]

28:53.970 --> 28:54.970
Woo-hoo!

28:55.340 --> 28:56.540
[Wing Goats bleat]

28:59.783 --> 29:01.690
I made a monster match?

29:02.117 --> 29:06.872
[Count Dracula chuckles] Drac's
mother is going to be so happy!

29:07.913 --> 29:11.375
Wingoats? I mean, I really
like Bubble and Trouble.

29:12.210 --> 29:13.912
But I never thought
my monster match

29:14.003 --> 29:15.963
would be a pair of Wingoats.

29:16.928 --> 29:19.348
I wonder if I can train them
to do tricks.

29:19.673 --> 29:20.983
Like magic tricks?

29:21.207 --> 29:22.740
Yeah, maybe. Or, you know?

29:22.823 --> 29:25.682
Like a flying pig that you can
train to fetch your slippers.

29:25.788 --> 29:28.935
Then I could just say: "Go home
and fetch my boomerang."

29:29.270 --> 29:30.270
And, poof!

29:33.648 --> 29:35.008
Oh, my house!

29:35.233 --> 29:36.525
How did we get here?

29:36.608 --> 29:41.072
Huh? All I said was: "Go home
and fetch my boomerang."

29:41.155 --> 29:43.825
And, I said where I wanted to go.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.120
And suddenly, we're here.

29:47.662 --> 29:51.665
My bat boomerang! There it is!
Right where I left it.

29:52.958 --> 29:54.502
Oh, bats.

29:55.628 --> 29:58.673
[Drac sighs]
Hey, come back here!

30:00.697 --> 30:01.888
[Wing Goats bleat]

30:02.218 --> 30:05.095
Huh? Even my monster match
moves have moves!

30:05.472 --> 30:06.805
-[Wingoats bleating]
-OK.

30:07.172 --> 30:09.827
Now that I've got both of you,
and my boomerang,

30:10.477 --> 30:13.145
I just wish I'd knew how to get
back to the park.

30:14.398 --> 30:16.708
Hi, Dad. I got my bat boomerang.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.803
I see that, but, how?

30:19.212 --> 30:21.490
I just wished I could go home,
and, poof!

30:21.782 --> 30:22.782
[everyone gasps]

30:24.573 --> 30:26.575
[Drac]
And poof, here I am!

30:27.703 --> 30:31.490
Drac's monster match power
is teleportation?

30:31.998 --> 30:33.332
Teleport... What?

30:33.718 --> 30:35.028
Teleportation.

30:35.700 --> 30:38.622
It is a very rare power
for a vampire.

30:38.923 --> 30:40.958
Especially one so young.

30:41.333 --> 30:44.115
Teleportation is really cool!

30:45.023 --> 30:46.562
Uh, what is it?

30:46.763 --> 30:50.333
Teleportation is the ability
to go someplace

30:50.685 --> 30:52.278
as soon as you think of it.

30:52.712 --> 30:57.358
What? Like Drac could just wish
he was at Luigi's, and be there?

30:57.867 --> 31:00.158
Or the amusement park?
Or the library?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.442
That's the way
it's supposed to work.

31:02.528 --> 31:04.405
But, he's going to need practice.

31:04.627 --> 31:05.627
[Drac laughs]

31:09.547 --> 31:12.008
Lots and lots of practice.

31:12.680 --> 31:15.265
Drac's got two furever friends.

31:15.595 --> 31:17.110
And I don't even have one.

31:18.773 --> 31:20.940
Wait! Maybe Drac could share
with me!

31:21.440 --> 31:23.228
Then I could teleport too!

31:24.295 --> 31:26.970
Frankie, it doesn't really
work that way.

31:27.388 --> 31:28.868
You never know, Dad!

31:29.388 --> 31:31.088
It could happen.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.558
-[Lobo panting]
-[Cleo laughing]

31:35.018 --> 31:36.353
-[Frankie gasps]
-Yeah!

31:37.010 --> 31:38.010
[Katya laughing]

31:38.898 --> 31:40.817
-[Henri purring]
-Good job, Henri!

31:42.052 --> 31:45.100
That's six! We just need
two more.

31:45.698 --> 31:46.698
[Frankie sighs]

31:47.133 --> 31:50.460
Everyone's monster matches
are so amazing.

31:50.880 --> 31:51.945
They sure are.

31:53.037 --> 31:55.080
[Zoe giggles]
Luna thinks so too.

31:55.415 --> 31:58.308
Luna! Your braids are beautiful!

31:59.543 --> 32:00.545
[Luna neighs]

32:00.635 --> 32:02.863
Luna said she never thought
she'd ever

32:03.065 --> 32:04.798
have rainbow colors in her hair.

32:05.257 --> 32:06.342
She really likes them.

32:06.538 --> 32:09.538
I bet it would be super amazing
to make a monster match

32:09.835 --> 32:11.015
with a unicorn.

32:11.555 --> 32:12.640
[Luna neighs]

32:12.960 --> 32:15.742
Luna says unicorns aren't
monster pets,

32:16.117 --> 32:18.178
so they can't make
monster matches.

32:18.520 --> 32:21.000
You never know.
It could happen.

32:21.515 --> 32:23.092
[Luna neighs]

32:23.413 --> 32:25.145
Oh, thank you, Luna.

32:25.445 --> 32:26.445
What'd she say?

32:26.763 --> 32:30.193
She said it doesn't matter if she
can't make a monster match,

32:30.645 --> 32:33.223
she's happy she made
a monster friend.

32:33.663 --> 32:37.475
And I'm really happy to have
made a unicorn friend too.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.733
-[Drac gasps]
-[Frankie gasps]

32:39.817 --> 32:40.817
[Drac gasps]

32:41.343 --> 32:42.343
Oh, goodness!

32:42.543 --> 32:45.500
I know it's important for Cleo,
Drac, and Lobo

32:45.715 --> 32:47.883
to practice their new super powers.

32:48.218 --> 32:50.123
Practice makes perfect.

32:50.443 --> 32:54.913
But maybe we could find a better,
safer way for them to practice?

32:55.370 --> 32:56.897
Excellent point, Esme.

32:57.098 --> 33:00.010
And I think I know
just the thing.

33:02.410 --> 33:03.738
Ready, Super Monsters?

33:04.067 --> 33:05.192
[Super Monsters]
Ready!

33:05.568 --> 33:07.768
On your marks, get set.

33:08.493 --> 33:09.493
Go!

33:09.823 --> 33:12.248
[everyone cheering]

33:13.978 --> 33:14.978
[Count Dracula]
Yes, yes!

33:16.162 --> 33:17.288
[Super Monsters laughing]

33:20.082 --> 33:24.420
[Cleo chuckling]
Whoa, thanks, Griffy.

33:25.365 --> 33:27.920
I feel the need for speed!

33:32.140 --> 33:33.340
[background music]

33:37.793 --> 33:44.448
Slow motion is so cool!

-[Griffy purrs]

34:00.015 --> 34:03.457
[Cleo and Griffy cheer]

34:04.627 --> 34:05.628
A sparkly!

34:11.632 --> 34:12.632
Great job, Griffy!

34:13.052 --> 34:14.969
Now we have six sparklies!

34:16.304 --> 34:18.402
You just need two more
to win!

34:19.766 --> 34:20.851
[Drac]
Boom!

34:21.226 --> 34:23.687
I want to take Bubble
and Trouble to meet my mom!

34:23.818 --> 34:27.014
You can do it, Drac, just think
about where you want to go.

34:27.400 --> 34:28.442
OK.

34:30.179 --> 34:33.078
What? My mom, not museum.

34:33.405 --> 34:36.324
OK, let's go back to the park!

34:37.478 --> 34:38.478
Huh?

34:40.078 --> 34:41.830
[Drac]
Oh, not the amusement park.

34:41.989 --> 34:43.177
The other one!

34:46.710 --> 34:49.922
Oh, I just wanted to take
the Wingoats to meet mom.

34:50.255 --> 34:52.467
But I can't figure out
how to get back home.

34:52.748 --> 34:55.777
Your mother isn't home yet,
she's still at the bank.

34:56.280 --> 34:58.208
She's working
the graveyard shift.

34:58.513 --> 34:59.513
Graveyard shift?

35:00.663 --> 35:01.663
Huh?

35:03.142 --> 35:04.142
Oops.

35:06.243 --> 35:08.230
-[Henri purrs]
-What is it, Henri?

35:09.077 --> 35:10.077
[Katya gasps]

35:11.218 --> 35:12.428
I see it, Henri!

35:12.640 --> 35:14.327
We only need one more!

35:14.730 --> 35:17.170
Way to go, Katya!
Good job, Henri!

35:17.408 --> 35:18.408
[Henri meows]

35:20.255 --> 35:23.725
-[Katya gasps]
-You're not part of the game!

35:25.958 --> 35:27.335
[Spike]
Bring that back!

35:31.880 --> 35:34.467
[Frankie panting]
You can't catch me!

35:35.425 --> 35:38.678
[Zoe laughs]
Yes, I can!

You got me!

36:06.998 --> 36:08.375
[Zoe] Wow!

36:10.332 --> 36:11.827
[Esme and Igor laugh]

36:14.435 --> 36:18.467
Luna! You're a moonicorn!

36:19.210 --> 36:21.270
[Luna neighs]

36:21.555 --> 36:24.142
Zoe! You made a monster match!

36:24.558 --> 36:26.143
With a moonicorn!

-[Luna neighs]

-[camera clicks]
-[Luna neighs]

36:40.658 --> 36:43.160
[Zoey]
Daddy! Enough pictures.

36:43.637 --> 36:44.637
Just one more.

36:51.142 --> 36:53.267
Luna, since you're a moonicorn,

36:53.350 --> 36:55.580
that means your magic
comes from the moon.

36:55.663 --> 36:56.663
[Luna neighs]

36:58.508 --> 37:02.888
So, moonicorns can't use
sunlight to make a rainbow path.

37:02.973 --> 37:04.660
[Luna neighs]

37:05.058 --> 37:08.620
But maybe you can use
the moonlight to make a moonbow!

37:09.050 --> 37:10.050
[Luna neighs]

37:18.332 --> 37:19.332
[Zoe gasps]

37:22.283 --> 37:23.283
[Zoe]
Wow!

37:24.438 --> 37:25.438
[Zoe laughs]

37:32.513 --> 37:34.152
Oh, bats.

37:37.355 --> 37:39.683
Making a monster match
is awesome!

37:40.278 --> 37:43.925
I'm really happy for Lobo,
and Cleo, and Drac, and Zoe.

37:44.588 --> 37:46.025
I know you are, Frankie.

37:46.390 --> 37:48.880
But, I'm kind of sad, too.

37:49.310 --> 37:50.812
It's OK, Frankie.

37:51.228 --> 37:53.063
No, it's not OK.

37:53.355 --> 37:54.465
It's not fair.

37:54.933 --> 37:57.980
Making a unicorn monster match
was my idea.

37:59.570 --> 38:02.407

with their one true monster,

Oh, Frankie, that is so kind of you
to be worried about how I feel.

49:01.535 --> 49:03.985
I will miss Griffy, Molasses,
and Phoebe.

49:04.483 --> 49:05.985
And the Wingoats.

49:06.235 --> 49:08.072
Especially the Wingoats.

49:08.612 --> 49:11.090
They are so silly, and so sweet.

49:11.733 --> 49:14.210
But, I know they'll still
come to visit me.

49:14.662 --> 49:18.113
They can play at the petting zoo while
their Super Monsters are in school.

49:18.207 --> 49:20.792
But it will never be
the same as it was.

49:21.083 --> 49:22.758
Doesn't that make you sad?

49:23.295 --> 49:24.295
Not at all.

really happy.

to help monster pets

to find their furever homes.

49:39.167 --> 49:43.103
And tonight was the best night
I've had in a long time.

How'd he get so big?

49:57.245 --> 49:58.247
Is he OK?

50:00.708 --> 50:03.677
Frankie, do you know the story
of Pinocchio?

50:04.112 --> 50:09.028
The puppet boy, who's nose grows
bigger every time he lies.

50:09.590 --> 50:12.408
Exactly! Jerry is
a lot like Pinocchio.

50:12.927 --> 50:15.055
But it's not just his nose
that grows.

50:15.243 --> 50:19.727
Jerry's whole body gets bigger
whenever he tells a fib.

50:20.290 --> 50:22.898
Really? I didn't know
Jerry could talk.

50:23.480 --> 50:26.160
I've only heard him chirp.
What does he say?

50:26.775 --> 50:29.152
Oh, Jerry doesn't speak human.

50:29.568 --> 50:31.128
But I speak monster pet.

50:31.690 --> 50:33.697
Like Zoe speaks pony?

50:33.908 --> 50:34.908
Exactly!

50:35.242 --> 50:38.787
So I always know what the animals
in the petting zoo are saying.

50:39.348 --> 50:41.080
And, unfortunately,

50:41.440 --> 50:44.330
Jerry can't resist
telling tall tales.

50:44.850 --> 50:48.783
And the bigger his stories get,
the bigger he grows.

50:50.273 --> 50:53.580
Hey, Jerry. I'm sorry you missed
the picnic.

50:54.010 --> 50:57.305
The monster animals
and I really missed you tonight.

50:57.847 --> 51:00.225
-I'm sure you missed us too.
-[Jerry grunts]

51:04.270 --> 51:05.270
Really?

51:05.563 --> 51:07.548
Not even a little bit?

51:07.940 --> 51:09.478
[Jerry grunts]

51:13.133 --> 51:14.585
We have to help him!

51:14.865 --> 51:15.865
I wish we could.

51:16.323 --> 51:19.253
But the only way that Jerry
could shrink back to normal

51:19.535 --> 51:21.162
is for him to tell the truth.

51:21.370 --> 51:22.635
The truth about what?

51:22.905 --> 51:25.992
This morning, Jerry was playing
with my stethoscope,

51:26.333 --> 51:29.492
-and broke it.
-But everybody breaks things.

51:29.945 --> 51:33.555
I break things all the time.
All the time.

51:34.342 --> 51:37.137
You're right, Frankie.
Everybody makes mistakes.

51:37.262 --> 51:39.597
And if Jerry had just told me
what happened,

51:39.680 --> 51:41.432
it wouldn't have been a problem.

51:41.587 --> 51:42.928
[Jerry grunts]

51:43.413 --> 51:46.468
But instead, he lied about it,
and blamed it on Phoebe.

51:46.938 --> 51:47.938
Poor Jerry.

51:48.190 --> 51:50.692
He must've felt bad
about breaking your ste...

51:51.150 --> 51:52.152
Your ste...

51:52.458 --> 51:54.605
-What's it called?
-A stethoscope.

51:54.892 --> 51:57.547
It's what doctors
and veterinarians use to listen

51:57.748 --> 51:59.427
to a patient's heart and lungs.

51:59.925 --> 52:01.745
Wow, that sounds so cool.

52:02.420 --> 52:04.207
I'd want to play with it too.

52:05.123 --> 52:08.105
But Jerry should've asked you
for permission first.

52:08.585 --> 52:09.585
Yes, he should have.

52:10.058 --> 52:13.253
And when he broke it,
he should've told you the truth.

52:13.913 --> 52:14.913
I wish he had.

52:15.617 --> 52:19.267
But instead, Jerry just
kept lying until he got so big,

52:19.350 --> 52:21.015
he couldn't leave
the petting zoo.

52:21.098 --> 52:22.098
[Jerry grunts]

52:22.430 --> 52:24.383
Maybe I could talk to him.

52:24.683 --> 52:26.645
I think that's an excellent idea.

52:30.873 --> 52:35.192
You know, Jerry? I break things
and make mistakes all the time.

52:35.893 --> 52:37.638
All the time.

52:38.998 --> 52:41.810
-[Jerry grunts]
-It feels bad to make a mistake.

52:42.240 --> 52:43.240
[Jerry grunts]

52:43.453 --> 52:47.897
But it feels really, really bad
if you lie about it.

52:51.125 --> 52:52.125
[Jerry grunts]

52:55.073 --> 52:57.090
Wow, what'd he say?

52:57.392 --> 53:01.055
Jerry says that he was the one
who broke my stethoscope.

53:01.620 --> 53:02.620
Not Phoebe.

53:02.877 --> 53:03.877
[Jerry grunts]

53:06.120 --> 53:09.095
Thank you, Jerry.
I accept your apology.

53:10.603 --> 53:11.603
[Jerry grunts]

53:12.180 --> 53:13.180
[Frankie laughs]

53:14.253 --> 53:18.707
Goodness, I've never heard Jerry
apologize so sincerely,

53:18.908 --> 53:20.728
or seen him shrink so quickly!

53:21.460 --> 53:24.138
-[Jerry grunts]
-I got you!

53:24.757 --> 53:26.350
[background music]

53:38.717 --> 53:40.468
[Super Monsters gasp]

53:41.320 --> 53:42.962
[Jerry grunts]

53:43.430 --> 53:45.140
[Lobo]
Oh, that's great, buddy!

53:45.418 --> 53:46.418
[Frankie stomps]

53:47.203 --> 53:49.765
Woo-hoo! You made
a monster match!

53:50.353 --> 53:51.897
[Frankie's mom]
A jackelope!

53:52.105 --> 53:56.785
Jerry is the sweetest, funniest,
bounciest furever friend ever.

53:57.223 --> 53:58.223
[Jerry grunts]

53:59.153 --> 54:01.418
You got a power-up too.

54:02.497 --> 54:04.778
Oh, I don't think so.

54:05.400 --> 54:09.220
Oh, Frankie, you definitely
got a power-up.

54:09.672 --> 54:12.595
A really big power-up!

54:13.102 --> 54:14.905
I did? What did I get?

54:15.158 --> 54:17.085
[everyone chuckling]

54:18.382 --> 54:19.632
Wow!

54:19.733 --> 54:21.383
You guys got really small.

54:21.878 --> 54:22.878
What happened?

54:23.140 --> 54:26.148
[Katya chuckling]
We're not small.

54:26.508 --> 54:28.155
You're just big.

54:28.393 --> 54:29.785
Super big.

54:33.290 --> 54:34.722
I'm big!

54:35.108 --> 54:38.043
Igor, Esme! I'm big!

54:38.527 --> 54:39.818
I'm mega-sized!

54:40.395 --> 54:42.873
But how do I shrink back
to Frankie size?

54:45.243 --> 54:46.717
Mega-size!

54:49.328 --> 54:50.328
Frankie-size.

54:52.373 --> 54:53.667

Whoa, yeah!

55:10.048 --> 55:11.863
[Frankie laughs]

55:13.478 --> 55:15.980
[Glorb squeaks]

55:16.398 --> 55:19.233
I tried to tell him that isn't
a dragon sparkly.

55:19.900 --> 55:24.072
No, that definitely
is not a sparkly.

55:24.448 --> 55:26.970
[Glorb squeaks]

55:27.575 --> 55:31.120
You're right, Glorb.
It is something really special.
