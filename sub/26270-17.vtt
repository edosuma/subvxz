20:01.287 --> 20:04.246
And this was a fallback plan,
you know?

20:04.290 --> 20:07.380
It was a safe place where
I could just be a voice

20:07.423 --> 20:10.383
and not be seen.

20:10.426 --> 20:12.254
But Doug is...

20:12.298 --> 20:14.474
he's gone now, and...

20:14.517 --> 20:15.823
I'm free.

20:15.866 --> 20:17.477
To what?

20:17.520 --> 20:19.392
What do you want to do?

20:20.349 --> 20:22.133
[sighs]

20:22.177 --> 20:25.136
I wish I knew.

20:26.877 --> 20:28.879

20:34.363 --> 20:35.408
NED:
Mm.

20:35.451 --> 20:38.149
[both chuckle]

20:38.193 --> 20:39.412
Ah.

20:39.455 --> 20:41.414
-Peonies.
-[chuckles]

20:41.457 --> 20:43.851
Like clockwork every year.

20:43.894 --> 20:46.070
-Happy anniversary.
-Happy anniversary.

20:46.114 --> 20:47.898
Mwah! Happy 25th.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.422
Oh, I know. Right, huh?

20:49.465 --> 20:52.512
I called Roberto, and he's
giving us the table in front.

20:52.555 --> 20:55.123
Oh. We're going to Roberto's?

20:55.166 --> 20:57.256
We always go to Roberto's.

20:59.170 --> 21:00.346
I'm sorry, honey.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.523
Were you wishing that
I'd pick someplace else?

21:03.566 --> 21:05.351
Wishes are for suckers.

21:05.394 --> 21:08.179
-Come here.
-[laughing]

21:08.223 --> 21:09.442
Mmm!

21:09.485 --> 21:10.443
[doorbell rings]

21:10.486 --> 21:12.314
Oh. Well, you go get your keys,

21:12.358 --> 21:14.273
-and I'll get the door.
-Okay.

21:18.929 --> 21:20.931
Oh, Ned.

21:26.589 --> 21:28.896
I guess you can still
surprise me after all.

21:28.939 --> 21:30.376
[chuckles]

21:41.169 --> 21:42.910
[siren wailing, horn blowing]

21:42.953 --> 21:44.955
All right.
Could I get that ETA?

21:47.958 --> 21:49.482
Mail bomb.
Wife's in rough shape,

21:49.525 --> 21:51.353
but she's still in one piece.

21:51.397 --> 21:53.137
The house
hasn't been cleared yet.

21:53.181 --> 21:55.139
Bomb squad's still
a couple of minutes out.

21:55.183 --> 21:56.924
-Copy that. Let's move!
-NED: Here!

21:56.967 --> 21:58.447
She's not breathing!

21:58.491 --> 22:00.362
I tried talking to her,
but she wouldn't answer.

22:00.406 --> 22:02.016
BUCK:
She can't hear you 'cause
her eardrums are blown out.

22:02.059 --> 22:03.452
-All right, let's turn her.
-On it.

22:05.236 --> 22:06.368
Ready.

22:08.457 --> 22:10.416
Eddie and I can handle this.

22:10.459 --> 22:12.592
Breathing's shallow.
We're looking

22:12.635 --> 22:14.637
at a bilateral pneumothorax.

22:14.681 --> 22:15.943
We don't release the pressure,
she could suffocate.

22:15.986 --> 22:17.945
I did my share
of these in combat.

22:17.988 --> 22:19.381
Get some fentanyl, slow drip.

22:19.425 --> 22:21.296
Chim, there's post-attack
protocol.

22:21.340 --> 22:22.602
You're the captain.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.604
I'm also the most experienced
paramedic on-site.

22:24.647 --> 22:26.475
Four-inch catheter, ten-gauge.

22:26.519 --> 22:28.956
All right, Buck and Eddie, therecould be a secondary device.

22:28.999 --> 22:30.610
We need to get everyone
off the "X."

22:30.653 --> 22:32.307
Sir, is there anyone else
in the house?

22:32.351 --> 22:33.961
Uh... no, no. Is she gonnamake it? Please, please, please

22:34.004 --> 22:35.484
-tell me she's gonna make it.
-Why don't you come with us?

22:35.528 --> 22:37.225
-We can check you out.
-No, no, no, she has to know

22:37.268 --> 22:38.618
that-that we weren't just
going out to dinner.

22:38.661 --> 22:41.098
-I had tickets for us to Fiji!
-You can tell her...

22:41.142 --> 22:42.970
-You can tell her yourself
later, I promise.
-[grunts]

22:43.013 --> 22:45.189
HEN:
Ma'am, can you hear me?
You're going to feel a pinch,

22:45.233 --> 22:46.495
but it's gonna
relieve the pressure.

22:48.236 --> 22:50.630
-[gasping]
-All right, tape her!

22:50.673 --> 22:52.371

23:03.251 --> 23:05.253
-[crying]: No!
-Sharp!

23:06.341 --> 23:08.648

23:08.691 --> 23:10.519

-ABUELA: Hola.
-Hola.
-SHANNON: And now,

23:49.123 --> 23:50.690
we're gonna get some...

23:50.733 --> 23:52.039
Ice cream!

23:52.082 --> 23:54.520
[laughs]:
Oh, ice cream?

23:54.563 --> 23:58.262
Well, I do not envy you
putting him to sleep tonight.

23:58.306 --> 24:00.047
When I call you later
to complain,

24:00.090 --> 24:02.484
just don't say "I told you so"?

24:02.528 --> 24:04.747
[chuckles]
All right, I promise.

24:04.791 --> 24:06.053
I love you.

24:06.096 --> 24:08.055
I love you.

24:08.098 --> 24:10.100
[metallic scraping]

24:13.103 --> 24:16.063
Ooh! When's the wedding?

24:16.106 --> 24:19.327
We're already married. Wait.

24:19.370 --> 24:20.676
We don't have
to get married again, do we?

24:20.720 --> 24:23.070
Talk to Bobby.

24:23.113 --> 24:25.202
Maybe he can get you guys
a discount.

24:25.246 --> 24:27.248
[chuckles]

24:30.817 --> 24:32.732
[sighs]
Sue.

24:32.775 --> 24:34.734
Sorry. I know
that you're on your way out.

24:34.777 --> 24:36.649
Oh, Don's picking me up.

24:36.692 --> 24:39.303
Now matter how many watches Igive that man, he's always late.

24:39.347 --> 24:41.784
[chuckles]
I am not gonna be able

24:41.828 --> 24:44.134
to take the extra shift
on Friday.

24:44.178 --> 24:46.180
I had something scheduled
for the morning, but then

24:46.223 --> 24:48.530
they called, and they needed itin the afternoon, so...

24:48.574 --> 24:50.358
That's okay.I'll get someone else to cover.

24:50.401 --> 24:51.533
Have a good night.

24:51.577 --> 24:54.231
It's a job interview.

24:54.275 --> 24:57.104
I-I'm not sure

24:57.147 --> 24:58.801
if I'm supposed
to be telling you that.

24:58.845 --> 25:01.108
It just feels weird hiding it.

25:01.151 --> 25:03.763
So you've decided, then?

25:03.806 --> 25:05.547
You're leaving us.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.594
Josh told me about the talk.

25:10.857 --> 25:13.816
I spent...
years not having a voice,

25:13.860 --> 25:16.253
and now that I do,

25:16.297 --> 25:19.343
it just feels likewhat I'm saying doesn't matter.

25:19.387 --> 25:21.389
Oh, I think
you underestimate yourself

25:21.432 --> 25:23.391
and your contribution here.

25:23.434 --> 25:25.480
I appreciate that.

25:25.524 --> 25:29.397
But, honestly, here, I'm just
a person who sends help,

25:29.440 --> 25:33.662
and I need to get back to beingthe person who gives it.

25:39.189 --> 25:40.582
EDDIE:
Voilà.

25:41.627 --> 25:45.152
SHANNON:
Ooh, Eddie, I love these.

25:45.195 --> 25:47.589
So is this some kind of
Forrest Gumpreference?

25:47.633 --> 25:49.635
"Life is like a box
of chocolates"?

25:49.678 --> 25:53.203
Actually, uh, life is like
a vat of molten chocolate.

25:53.247 --> 25:56.685
Yeah, sometimes you...

25:56.729 --> 25:58.600
you fall into it,

25:58.644 --> 26:00.863
it drags you down,

26:00.907 --> 26:03.823
but it-it's...
it's warm, you know?

26:03.866 --> 26:05.825
It-It's... and it's...

26:05.868 --> 26:07.609
It's sweet.

26:07.653 --> 26:10.656
This is a very weird metaphor.

26:11.700 --> 26:13.397
[sighs]

26:13.441 --> 26:15.617
When you came back
into our lives,

26:15.661 --> 26:17.619
I was so glad.

26:17.663 --> 26:19.621
-And afraid.
-[chuckles softly]

26:19.665 --> 26:22.537
I knew Christopher missed you,
but I-I...

26:22.581 --> 26:25.409
I don't think I realized just...

26:25.453 --> 26:27.498
how much I did, too.

26:27.542 --> 26:29.326
-Eddie, uh, I think...
-Oh, please, just

26:29.370 --> 26:31.415
let me say this.

26:31.459 --> 26:33.766
We were so young the first time.

26:33.809 --> 26:35.768
You know, young and not ready.

26:35.811 --> 26:39.685
But we had this amazing kid.

26:41.687 --> 26:45.821
Being his dad has been thesingle greatest joy of my life.

26:45.865 --> 26:48.781
And that little boy has...
tau.. taught me more

26:48.824 --> 26:51.435
about being a man
than war ever did.

26:51.479 --> 26:52.785
You're a good dad.

26:52.828 --> 26:54.569
You're a great dad.

26:54.613 --> 26:59.792
Well, if I am it's because...
he deserves it.

26:59.835 --> 27:01.881
Yeah.

27:01.924 --> 27:04.840
But he deserves his mommy, too.

27:04.884 --> 27:07.495
-He loves his mommy.

27:27.733 --> 27:29.473

27:29.517 --> 27:32.259
I'm not... pregnant.

27:32.302 --> 27:35.305
I... I was just late.

27:36.437 --> 27:38.613
I freaked out, and then,

27:38.657 --> 27:40.833
I freaked you out, too,
and I'm sorry.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.923
That's got to be a relief,
right?

27:43.966 --> 27:46.839
It... it doesn't change a thing.

27:46.882 --> 27:48.449
It does for me.

27:50.016 --> 27:51.931
What?

27:51.974 --> 27:55.761
I wrote this letter
a few years ago

27:55.804 --> 27:57.937
right after I left,

27:57.980 --> 28:00.983
or, actually, after I...

28:01.027 --> 28:03.290
didn't come back...

28:03.333 --> 28:05.292
to Christopher...

28:05.335 --> 28:07.947
trying to explain
why I couldn't be there.

28:07.990 --> 28:11.298
And I figured that if,
for some reason,

28:11.341 --> 28:13.430
I never found my way back,

28:13.474 --> 28:16.433
that he'd want answers.

28:16.477 --> 28:18.784
And he needed to know that...

28:18.827 --> 28:21.656
it wasn't his fault.

28:21.700 --> 28:24.572
That his mother didn't leave
because she didn't love him.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.966
She left because she did.

28:27.009 --> 28:29.795
I never sent it, obviously.

28:29.838 --> 28:32.841
And then, when I found out todaythat I wasn't pregnant,

28:32.885 --> 28:35.626
I took that letter out,
I read it.

28:38.020 --> 28:40.980
Eddie, I never want
to have to send that letter.

28:41.023 --> 28:43.330
Why would you ever?

28:43.373 --> 28:47.638
Because if I try to do this
again before I'm ready,

28:47.682 --> 28:49.858
there won't be a second chance.

28:51.904 --> 28:54.558
[crying]:
I can't fail him again,

28:54.602 --> 28:57.823
or you, and I won't.

28:59.389 --> 29:01.565
I'm still learning

29:01.609 --> 29:04.351
how to be someone's mother.

29:04.394 --> 29:07.876
And after that, maybe I canlearn how to be someone's wife.

29:10.836 --> 29:11.967
We're still married.

29:18.060 --> 29:20.410
I think we should get a divorce.

29:36.426 --> 29:37.819
Glad you came.

29:37.863 --> 29:38.951
Yeah, I'm always down
for coffee,

29:38.994 --> 29:40.648
but what's really going on?

29:40.691 --> 29:42.389
Remember your first call?

29:42.432 --> 29:45.522
Uh, anaphylactic shock--
seafood allergy.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.395
You remember the first lesson
I taught you on that call?

29:48.438 --> 29:50.397
Yes, you taught me to listen.

29:50.440 --> 29:52.094
Okay, terrific.

29:52.138 --> 29:53.835
So, do that now.

for a long time last night

29:56.055 --> 29:57.839

to convince you

29:57.883 --> 29:58.971
of the difference you've made.

29:59.014 --> 30:00.973
Look, I really appreciate

30:01.016 --> 30:03.062
that you and Sue were talking...

30:03.105 --> 30:05.891

were talking to each other.

30:16.031 --> 30:18.555
-Oh.
-The police got there in time,

30:18.599 --> 30:20.557
and I got home in one piece.

30:20.601 --> 30:22.516
Because of you.

30:22.559 --> 30:24.735
Hearing your voice-- it...

30:24.779 --> 30:27.564
it kept me focused,
gave me hope.

30:27.608 --> 30:30.002
Your voice saved my life.

30:30.045 --> 30:32.004
Even though I didn't hear it.

30:32.047 --> 30:34.006
I was unconscious,

30:34.049 --> 30:36.008
in labor.

30:36.051 --> 30:39.794
The earthquake had just hit,
and I... I was dying.

30:41.143 --> 30:43.667
-We both were.
-[baby cooing]

30:43.711 --> 30:46.801
I didn't know what to do.
You said help wasn't coming.

30:46.845 --> 30:48.934
It should have been terrifying,

30:48.977 --> 30:52.111
but your voice was so calm
and reassuring.
