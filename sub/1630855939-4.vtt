Stay still. I'm almost done.

00:26.125 --> 00:27.458
[Dolph] What-- What are you doing?

00:27.458 --> 00:30.000
[Warden] Same as usual.
Fixing the mess you made.

00:30.791 --> 00:31.625
There you go.

[Dolph groans, breathing heavily]

00:34.125 --> 00:35.541
Whoa. That feels weird.

00:36.625 --> 00:39.416
[Warden] Yeah, I took the opportunity
to give you a weapons upgrade.

00:40.250 --> 00:41.708
It's gonna pass. Don't worry.

00:43.375 --> 00:45.958
Where-- [groans] Where the hell are we?

00:45.958 --> 00:48.083
Out of harm's way. For now.

00:48.708 --> 00:51.416
Eden's gonna take advantage
of last night's situation.

00:51.416 --> 00:53.666
They're on their way
to attack the New Wasteland.

00:53.666 --> 00:55.083
So that's where we're going.

00:56.625 --> 00:58.708
We've got to warn Marcus Holloway.

00:58.708 --> 01:02.291
[Dolph] No. No, no, no, no, no.
This is where we part, Warden.

01:02.791 --> 01:06.166
You go do your little field trip
to Marcus Holloway's New Wasteland.

01:06.666 --> 01:07.875
I'm going back my way.

01:07.875 --> 01:09.458
[Warden] Hah. Really?

01:09.458 --> 01:11.041
And which way is that?

01:11.041 --> 01:15.125
Anywhere far from you is fine by me.
I am done being your puppet.

01:15.125 --> 01:16.916
So, thanks for the arm fixing,

01:16.916 --> 01:19.666
and, oh, fuck you for everything else.

01:19.666 --> 01:20.583
[Warden] You fuck.

01:21.291 --> 01:25.333
Eden's army is on its way as we speak
to take back the New Wasteland.

01:25.333 --> 01:27.625
You can't just walk away.

[Dolph] Hey, Warden.

02:49.833 --> 02:52.333
I thought you were supposed
to know this place inside out.

02:52.333 --> 02:53.708
Just shut up, Laserhawk.

02:54.291 --> 02:56.958
I don't understand. Should be working.

02:57.666 --> 02:59.750
[Dolph] Can't say I've missed this place.

03:00.666 --> 03:02.750
Feels different, though.
I don't know what it is.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.083
- [Warden] Fuck!
- [wall bangs]

03:04.083 --> 03:07.375

03:07.375 --> 03:08.916
[Dolph] Hey, Warden.

03:10.083 --> 03:11.083
I've got an idea.

03:12.458 --> 03:16.041
One, I put my head
real close to that door.

03:16.791 --> 03:20.250
Two, I say, "Fuck you, Warden."

03:20.250 --> 03:22.125
Just to make you mad.

03:22.833 --> 03:25.541
Three, you blow my head off.

03:26.125 --> 03:29.041
Four, we're both free.

Don't tempt me, Laserhawk.

03:55.125 --> 03:57.000
I guess it's a sign it <i>is</i> the end.

03:57.000 --> 03:59.625
[chuckles] Yeah. You're telling me.

03:59.625 --> 04:00.833

I've just seen the Warden

Well, it feels wrong.

Warden.

04:17.916 --> 04:18.750
[Warden] Hmm?

04:20.458 --> 04:23.166
Why do you care so much
for the New Wasteland?

04:24.250 --> 04:26.583
Assuming that such a place even exists.

04:26.583 --> 04:29.708
The New Wasteland is real. Trust me.

You're not the only one
who had to crawl your way up.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.625
I was born in Wasteland.

04:37.666 --> 04:38.666
It's my home.

04:39.708 --> 04:41.125
And I will save my people.

He looks like a narc.

than looking so much like a narc.

to find out exactly what he is.

12:20.666 --> 12:23.083
I had a change of heart,
not a complete loss of faculties.

12:23.083 --> 12:25.625
I know when to press a tactical advantage.

12:27.333 --> 12:28.166
All right.

12:29.916 --> 12:32.916
How can you be so sure
of what happened to Holloway in there?

12:33.541 --> 12:35.291
I've seen Eden's intel reports.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.208
Everything in Wasteland is redacted.

12:38.750 --> 12:40.125
I have sources of my own.

12:42.291 --> 12:46.416
- [soldiers chanting]
- [footsteps marching]

12:46.416 --> 12:48.916

12:58.500 --> 12:59.333
[exhales]

13:00.083 --> 13:01.000
Oh, fuck.

13:02.416 --> 13:03.375
[phone app beeps]

13:03.375 --> 13:04.583
[Sarah] What?

13:04.583 --> 13:05.791
[Sam on phone] <i>Oh.</i>

13:05.791 --> 13:08.208
<i>I'm fine. What about you, Sarah?</i>

13:08.916 --> 13:11.000
Well, I really don't have the time, Dad.

13:11.000 --> 13:12.833
[Sam] <i>Don't worry. I won't be long.</i>

13:13.416 --> 13:15.333
<i>Um, did you get my gift?</i>

13:15.333 --> 13:16.250
Yeah. Yeah.

13:16.833 --> 13:17.833
Got your gift.

13:18.333 --> 13:20.041
It's very nice of you. Thank you.

13:20.041 --> 13:23.375
[Sam] <i>Ah. My pleasure, really.
I had a spare anyway.</i>

13:23.375 --> 13:27.375
<i>Thought it might be useful at the camp.
I hope it would give you an edge.</i>

13:27.375 --> 13:30.916
[Sarah scoffs] Don't worry about my edge.
I'm the first in my class by far.

13:30.916 --> 13:32.291
[Sam] <i>That's... great.</i>

13:32.291 --> 13:33.875
Yeah. And since I had the best grades,

13:33.875 --> 13:36.458
I got picked for the cybernetic
enhancement pilot program.

13:36.458 --> 13:38.166
So, I will be faster, stronger--

13:38.166 --> 13:41.208
[Sam] <i>Wait, wait.
Cybernetic enhancement? Sarah!</i>

13:41.208 --> 13:43.583
Dad, you don't understand.
This is a huge opportunity.

13:43.583 --> 13:45.791
[Sam] <i>Sarah, you're gonna let
those bastards chop you up</i>

13:45.791 --> 13:47.833
<i>and turn you into a goddamn cyborg?</i>

13:48.541 --> 13:50.750
Thanks to these bastards,
I'm out of the Wasteland.

13:50.750 --> 13:53.791
And if Eden was so bad, you wouldn't be
in probation, you would be in jail!

13:53.791 --> 13:54.958
[Sam] <i>Oh, right, right.</i>

13:54.958 --> 13:56.916
<i>So I should be grateful
and say thank you?!</i>

13:56.916 --> 13:59.583
Yes! You should be grateful
they're giving me that chance,

13:59.583 --> 14:02.125
despite being the daughter of a traitor!

14:03.583 --> 14:04.458
[static on phone]

14:04.458 --> 14:05.833
[feet shuffling]

14:07.833 --> 14:12.125
[Sam sighs] <i>Sarah, please, don't do this.</i>

14:12.125 --> 14:13.958
I'm fighting for what I believe in.

14:15.041 --> 14:17.708
You did the same
for a country that didn't deserve it.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.916
[Sam sighs] <i>Yeah.</i>

14:20.916 --> 14:23.916
<i>Maybe America never did represent
the values I believed in.</i>

14:24.791 --> 14:26.458
<i>But they were worth fighting for.</i>

14:27.500 --> 14:30.000
<i>And actually, they still are.</i>

14:30.000 --> 14:31.333
What do you mean?

14:32.166 --> 14:34.833
A good man is rotting in hell
because of me.

14:34.833 --> 14:37.958
It's my responsibility
to make things right.

14:39.041 --> 14:39.958
Holloway?

14:39.958 --> 14:41.250
Dad, where are you now?

14:42.041 --> 14:42.958
<i>Dad?</i>

14:44.500 --> 14:45.708
[Sam] Goodbye, Sarah.

14:46.541 --> 14:48.500
- I will always love you.

15:49.791 --> 15:53.291
Hey, buddy.
Aren't you missing a few parts there?

15:53.291 --> 15:54.208
[Sam] Funny.

15:54.833 --> 15:57.041
I was just about to say the same to you.

15:57.625 --> 15:59.208

16:18.250 --> 16:19.625

[taxi game music playing]

16:30.875 --> 16:33.500
[Marcus] Follow... follow the arrow.
Follow the arrow.

16:33.500 --> 16:35.250
I gotta deliver the passenger. I can...

16:35.250 --> 16:37.583
Follow the arrow. Follow the arrow.

16:37.583 --> 16:38.625
Oh no, no.

16:38.625 --> 16:40.750
No, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no! Please, no!

16:40.750 --> 16:42.875
I'm following the arrow! No! Please!

16:42.875 --> 16:45.125
No, no! N-No! No! No!

[groans]

16:55.458 --> 16:57.333
Holloway, are you okay?

16:57.333 --> 16:58.583
Can you walk?

16:59.375 --> 17:01.125
I... I don't know.

17:01.833 --> 17:04.083
[Sam] Well, better recover
a lot faster than this.

17:04.708 --> 17:06.416
Because I'm gonna need those legs.

17:06.416 --> 17:08.208
[tense darksynth music playing]

17:08.208 --> 17:11.166
[electronic voice] <i>Alarm. Alarm.</i>

17:11.166 --> 17:12.125
On your left.

17:15.166 --> 17:16.166
[Sam] Stop here.

- [explosion]
- [glass shatters]

17:58.708 --> 18:01.083
Thank you. For getting me out.

18:02.291 --> 18:04.625
Well, you were there
because of my daughter.

18:05.666 --> 18:06.875
I had no choice.

18:07.666 --> 18:08.916
I did my duty.

18:11.750 --> 18:14.000
You guys still in touch?

18:14.875 --> 18:16.250
Not anymore, I'm afraid.

18:17.041 --> 18:20.666
She's military now.
Totally brainwashed by Eden.

18:21.791 --> 18:24.875
I think if we ever meet again,
she'd put a bullet in my head.

18:26.416 --> 18:29.291
Oh. Damn. That sucks.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.875
You should take some rest,
now you're a free man.

18:37.791 --> 18:38.625
Yeah.

18:41.416 --> 18:42.250
Free.

18:43.041 --> 18:43.875
But tell me, Fisher.

18:44.958 --> 18:49.000
What's the use of being free, knowing
my friends are still locked up back there?

18:50.250 --> 18:51.541
In that hell.

18:53.333 --> 18:55.208
DedSec is my family.

18:56.000 --> 18:57.708
It's the only thing I ever had.

18:59.750 --> 19:01.458
I've got to get them out of there.

19:02.875 --> 19:04.291
I have to go back.

19:08.750 --> 19:12.125
Well, I've never left a man behind.

19:17.708 --> 19:19.291
Wait. Wait, wait, wait.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.083
You're telling me
your father helped Holloway?

19:22.083 --> 19:25.000
Yes. They organized for months.

19:25.583 --> 19:30.000
Holloway used his natural charisma
to gather more and more people.

19:30.000 --> 19:33.750
My father used his military skills
to train and plan the attack.

19:33.750 --> 19:38.166
And what started as the most
dangerous jailbreak in Eden's history

19:38.166 --> 19:39.291
eventually became--

19:39.291 --> 19:41.083
[Dolph] The Wasteland Uprising.

19:41.666 --> 19:42.500
[Sarah] Yes.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.833
A revolution.

19:43.833 --> 19:47.916
Holloway started to spread his message
in Eden's home,

19:47.916 --> 19:49.583
hacking the TV signal,

19:49.583 --> 19:51.708
showing Eden's ugly truth.

19:51.708 --> 19:54.458
Of course, the Board of Directors
couldn't allow that.

19:54.458 --> 19:57.125
...Eden's response
to this evil terrorist threat will be firm

19:57.125 --> 20:00.875
to protect the safety and sanctity
of Eden's way of life.

20:04.750 --> 20:07.375
[sonar pulse beeping]

20:07.375 --> 20:10.750
[Sarah] As I was watching
these dots blinking on the screen,

20:10.750 --> 20:13.666
about to take out so many lives,

20:15.000 --> 20:17.666
I was asking myself for the first time...

20:25.750 --> 20:27.916
"Was my father right?"

20:30.375 --> 20:32.833
I kept thinking
about that last phone call we had.

20:33.625 --> 20:38.666
I... I had so many questions.
I... I wanted to talk to him.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.250
But that never happened.

20:45.666 --> 20:47.125
Because he died that day.

20:50.208 --> 20:53.208
[sobs] He died thinking I hated him.

20:58.583 --> 20:59.416
[Dolph] Well...

21:00.583 --> 21:03.000
Turns out
you aren't a complete psycho after all.

21:04.708 --> 21:05.708
[Sarah] What the hell?!

21:05.708 --> 21:08.375
- Laserhawk, your hand! Your face!
- What?

21:15.125 --> 21:15.958
My God.

21:17.041 --> 21:18.208
This is not Supermaxx.

21:20.541 --> 21:24.666
- This is--
- [Marcus] Yes. This is not Eden anymore.

21:26.333 --> 21:28.750
Welcome to the VR facility.

21:29.916 --> 21:32.750
It's been a while, Little Sarah.
