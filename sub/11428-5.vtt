GLENN VILLENEUVE:
Caribou are one of the most
important animals to me

00:15.033 --> 00:16.400
up in this country.

00:18.100 --> 00:20.500
Most years, about half
the meat I eat is caribou.

00:20.967 --> 00:24.467
I've been seeing caribou
down in this country
earlier in recent years,

00:24.533 --> 00:26.733
and I'm wondering
if there might be
some around right now.

00:29.533 --> 00:32.167
The biggest thing
about caribou,
you just can't count on them.

00:32.233 --> 00:33.600
It's different every year.

00:34.967 --> 00:38.033
Sometimes, there's not
a single caribou in the
country for months.

00:40.233 --> 00:42.200
Knowledge of the animals
you're hunting

00:42.867 --> 00:45.100
is a big part
of the equation.

00:45.167 --> 00:47.833
It's important to understand
animals and their behaviour.

00:47.900 --> 00:48.967
(MAKING MOOSE CALL)

00:49.033 --> 00:50.433
When I'm hunting
moose in the fall,

00:50.500 --> 00:52.867
I'll make a sound that
a moose makes with my voice,

00:52.933 --> 00:54.667
and that'll call
the moose to me.

00:54.800 --> 00:56.500
(MOOSE CALL)

00:57.267 --> 00:59.133
That doesn't
work with caribou.

00:59.200 --> 01:02.400
This time of year,
if there's caribou around,
I can't call a caribou to me.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.200
I'm going to try
and sneak up on the caribou.

01:09.267 --> 01:10.867
Approach him silently.

01:11.833 --> 01:13.933
So I'm looking for
signs of caribou.

01:14.000 --> 01:16.033
I'm listening for caribou.

01:17.167 --> 01:18.833
Looking for tracks
in the snow.

01:19.767 --> 01:21.400
You got to know
the animal you're after.

01:22.533 --> 01:23.867
You got to understand it,

01:23.933 --> 01:26.167
and you got to tailor
your approach to that animal.

01:28.000 --> 01:31.533
A lot of times
caribou will travel
up kinda high on this ridge.

01:31.600 --> 01:34.367
So I'm heading up here,
see if I can find any tracks,

01:34.433 --> 01:36.333
see if I can possibly
find any caribou.

01:40.700 --> 01:42.467
Snow is good for tracking.

01:42.533 --> 01:45.700
If any caribou came through,
I should be able to
intercept their tracks.

01:45.767 --> 01:48.333
Look at this, something
went through here.

01:49.800 --> 01:51.500
What is this?

01:51.567 --> 01:53.133
This is no caribou track.

01:57.567 --> 01:59.533
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

02:23.133 --> 02:26.200
See this?
The whole body's
dragging in the snow.

02:27.433 --> 02:29.033
See these lines?

02:30.133 --> 02:32.200
Those are the marks of quills.

02:32.267 --> 02:34.567
That's a porcupine track,
but I gotta know
which way he's going

02:34.633 --> 02:35.867
if I wanna catch up with him.

02:36.200 --> 02:38.300
Porcupines are good eating.

02:39.100 --> 02:41.333
Just by feeling the track
with my bare hand,

02:41.400 --> 02:43.600
I can feel the details
of the paw print.

02:43.667 --> 02:45.533
I can feel the bed
of the track,

02:45.600 --> 02:47.400
which way it's angled.

02:47.467 --> 02:52.000
Toes are always gonna be
lower than the heel when
they're travelling in snow.

02:52.067 --> 02:53.133
Yeah.

02:53.200 --> 02:54.467
That porcupine's
headed this way.

02:54.533 --> 02:55.900
I'm going to try
and catch up with it.

02:56.833 --> 02:58.067
I never know
what I'm gonna find.

02:58.133 --> 02:59.700
I have to take advantage
of the opportunity.

02:59.767 --> 03:01.033
I'm thinking mostly
about caribou,

03:01.100 --> 03:02.733
but I never know
what I'm gonna find.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.067
Whatever I find,
that I can take advantage of,
I take advantage of it.

03:05.133 --> 03:06.967
I'm an opportunistic hunter.

03:07.733 --> 03:09.633
If I hustle, I should be able
to catch up with it.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.700
This is a pretty fresh track
right here.

03:12.167 --> 03:14.933
It is very hungry country.
There aren't that
many animals around.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
I have to take advantage
of whatever I can find.

03:21.600 --> 03:24.233
CHIP HAILSTONE:
If you're not prepared,
you're not gonna score.

03:24.467 --> 03:27.300
If you're not prepared,
you're probably not gonna
survive it.

03:42.067 --> 03:43.367
Hey, puppy, puppy.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.633
Today we're having a blizzard.

03:44.700 --> 03:45.967
It's the first one
of the year.

03:46.867 --> 03:49.433
We have real thin ice
and this isn't doing
our ice any good.

03:49.500 --> 03:52.567
The ice isn't gonna thicken
with this crap on top,
and it's really warm out.

03:52.633 --> 03:54.533
But it's really windy, too,
and it's really wet.

03:57.033 --> 04:01.467
I need to get me a pole
that I can make into a handle
for an ice chisel.

04:02.700 --> 04:04.133
Call 'em a "tuk" up here.

04:04.200 --> 04:05.533
Ice is going to thicken.

04:05.600 --> 04:06.867
It's just not
happening right now.

04:06.933 --> 04:08.300
And I'm gonna
need that ice chisel.

04:08.367 --> 04:10.033
I'm gonna need to go along
and test the ice as I go.

04:10.100 --> 04:12.000
I'm also gonna need a way to
make a hole through the ice,

04:12.067 --> 04:14.533
and really efficient way
of doing it is with
an Eskimo tuk.

04:15.433 --> 04:16.467
It's got a nice weight to it.

04:16.533 --> 04:17.567
It's a little heavier
than I want,

04:17.633 --> 04:19.100
but it's gonna lose weight
when I skin it.

04:19.267 --> 04:21.867
Since it's freeze-up,
and it's stormy and
nobody's going anywhere,

04:21.933 --> 04:23.833
it's the time of year
to sit down and
get your tools made.

04:23.900 --> 04:27.267
And here in the land
of ice and snow,
this is the tool for me.

04:28.733 --> 04:31.133
If you want to get to fish,
you got to knock
a hole in the ice.

04:31.200 --> 04:33.233
If I want to knock
a hole in the ice,
I need to have myself a tuk.

04:41.000 --> 04:42.700
I'm stripping off
the bark right now.

04:42.767 --> 04:46.200
I'm gonna take off
the lumps, bumps,
the slivers, and the knots.

04:47.400 --> 04:49.067
We're going to dark winter.
We have thin ice.

04:49.867 --> 04:51.267
We have limited daylight.

04:52.300 --> 04:55.367
And it's time to prepare
ourselves for when
the sunshine comes back,

04:55.433 --> 04:56.767
but the deep cold is here.

04:58.333 --> 05:01.900
Not going on any ice
until I can have a look
at how thick it is.

05:03.300 --> 05:06.700
This right here, not only
will it be the thing that I
would use crossing the ice,

05:07.100 --> 05:09.433
tuk -ing ahead of me,
but should I break through,

05:09.500 --> 05:12.400
I have a stick I can put
sideways in my hole

05:12.467 --> 05:15.067
and use to get
myself out with.

05:15.133 --> 05:16.933
NARRATOR:
For the Hailstones,

05:17.000 --> 05:21.133
Arctic waterways provide
vital transportation
and fish for consumption.

05:21.200 --> 05:23.733
But they can be
extremely dangerous.

05:24.133 --> 05:25.367
(ICE CREAKING)

05:25.433 --> 05:28.133
And a misstep on thin ice
could be fatal.

05:32.067 --> 05:34.100
If you live out
in the country like we do,

05:34.167 --> 05:35.800
you end up using
one of these quite a bit,

05:35.867 --> 05:37.100
and they don't make
them in stores.

05:37.833 --> 05:40.833
They make cheap imitations,
but nobody makes a good one.

05:41.000 --> 05:42.800
And if you want the best,
you just do it yourself.

05:43.500 --> 05:46.733
This is the time of year,
while the ice is thin,
to make my ice chisel.

05:46.800 --> 05:50.667
So when it gets thick here in
a couple days, I can go put
this baby to use.

05:50.833 --> 05:53.467
This needs to be done before
I can go out on the ice.

05:54.867 --> 05:56.500
If I don't have this
to test the ice,

05:56.567 --> 05:57.867
then I won't know
what I'm walking on,

05:57.933 --> 05:59.200
and I'm taking a big chance.

06:00.833 --> 06:02.833
I'm just about done here.

06:03.200 --> 06:04.900
This is what I'll use
as I walk ahead of me,

06:04.967 --> 06:06.733
to see if this'll
plunge to the ice
ahead of me.

06:06.800 --> 06:09.200
If this will go through the
ice, I'll go through the ice.

06:09.300 --> 06:11.833
If this doesn't go through the
ice after a good hefty thump,

06:12.033 --> 06:13.167
then it's safe ice to walk on.

06:13.500 --> 06:15.333
And you can't buy
this in a store.

06:15.400 --> 06:18.167
No, it's something you just
gotta make yourself
if you want to have the best.

06:18.233 --> 06:21.500
And, uh, if I don't have much,
I might as well have the best.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.833
JESSIE HOLMES:
It's in your best interest
to not underestimate

06:28.900 --> 06:30.200
the dangers out here.

(DOGS BARKING AND HOWLING)

06:50.067 --> 06:52.800
Zeus, Thor, you want to go
haul some wood?

06:55.433 --> 07:00.033
Getting my dogs watered here
and then I'm gonna go get my
harnesses and lines set up.

07:01.067 --> 07:04.033
Take the dogs out on a run,
out in the flats.

07:08.133 --> 07:12.733
Finally, winter's setting in.
We're having ideal conditions
with a nice snow pack.

07:12.800 --> 07:17.500
So I'll be conditioning
my dog team while
I'm going out with a purpose,

07:17.567 --> 07:21.633
and I need to get some wood
around here because
it's starting to run slim

07:21.700 --> 07:24.500
on the immediate
amount of wood that
I've had stocked up.

07:26.033 --> 07:29.633
Your safe haven is the
woodpile for living up
here in the winter.

07:30.700 --> 07:34.567
Got to have wood to make
warm food for the dogs
and to warm my cabin

07:34.633 --> 07:37.000
so I can have a safe place
to come home to.

07:38.533 --> 07:40.867
Wood's a huge commodity
to me out here.

07:40.933 --> 07:42.867
We're not talking
like a little pile of wood.

07:43.700 --> 07:45.567
I need, like, stacks of wood.

07:54.233 --> 07:56.033
Yeah, these dogs love to run,

07:56.100 --> 07:57.600
so when you get to
hooking them up,

07:57.667 --> 08:00.700
they get all
crazy and excited. Whoa!

08:00.767 --> 08:03.933
These dogs ain't gonna
wait around no longer.
They're ready to go.

08:04.600 --> 08:07.700
I love to hear the dogs
barking and screaming
and howling.

08:07.767 --> 08:09.700
That means
they're ready to go.
They're feeling good.

08:11.767 --> 08:13.900
You ready guys? Whoo!

08:16.800 --> 08:17.933
I build on that attitude.

08:18.000 --> 08:19.567
All right! Straight ahead.

08:20.100 --> 08:21.800

SUE AIKENS:
The level of comfort
I enjoy in my life

08:28.533 --> 08:32.833
is absolutely
directly related to how hard
I've worked to attain it.

08:43.933 --> 08:47.300
What I'm working on here,
these are my solar panels.

08:48.233 --> 08:52.967
And now that the sunshine has
come back, what I can do now,
is get up here,

08:53.333 --> 08:57.100
start clearing it off
and I expose
these solar cells.

09:15.333 --> 09:17.667
What I want to do,
is before they make me,

09:17.733 --> 09:20.100
I want to get down,
get my binos, get my rifle,

and take the opportunity to
maybe get some fresh meat.

09:27.700 --> 09:31.233
It'd be nice to be able
to shoot the gun
and get my own dinner.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.000
In my own backyard,
on my own terms.

09:34.200 --> 09:38.133
Ptarmigan, it's one of the
only food sources out here
for a lot of the year.

09:38.267 --> 09:40.767
For being one of the dumbest
birds on the planet,

09:40.833 --> 09:42.867
they get away from me
all the freaking time.

09:48.133 --> 09:50.133
Good Lord,
they're all over the place.

09:51.200 --> 09:54.167
I'm seeing maybe
500 ptarmigan or so.

09:54.233 --> 09:57.800
But they're spread out
a little on the far side.

09:57.867 --> 10:00.167
Might be a case of my eyes
are bigger than my stomach

10:00.233 --> 10:03.500
and certainly bigger
than my talent with
a .22 open sights.

10:05.033 --> 10:08.100
Still 100, 120 yards
that direction.

10:08.167 --> 10:09.733

10:10.667 --> 10:13.400
Can I physically get close
enough to maybe take a shot?

10:13.467 --> 10:14.700
It's a roll of the dice, man.

10:14.767 --> 10:16.000
They're a little
on the far side,

10:16.067 --> 10:17.900
but it wouldn't be
me if I didn't try.

10:24.267 --> 10:25.667
There's one.

I can see some on the bank.

10:28.700 --> 10:30.933
Problem is I got the
sun in my eyes.

10:31.400 --> 10:33.633
Tends to blind you
from what you're aiming at.

10:33.700 --> 10:35.433
You want to be
a little off of that.

10:42.833 --> 10:45.133
It's a long
freakin'-ass shot, man.

10:59.600 --> 11:00.600
(GUNSHOT)

11:01.367 --> 11:02.533
Fucking bloody hell.

11:04.033 --> 11:05.300

11:08.000 --> 11:09.200
See my little foxy.

11:10.133 --> 11:12.767
I didn't realise
he had come
along for the ride.

11:12.833 --> 11:16.700
The last thing I want
to do is shoot
my little foxy friend.

11:16.767 --> 11:20.100
To me, it's no different than
knowing you have people
out that direction.

11:20.167 --> 11:21.667
Those are my homies.

11:21.733 --> 11:23.467
So I've got to be
very careful.

11:24.433 --> 11:26.667
Foxy's moved way over there
and he's pointing.

11:26.767 --> 11:28.500
So that means the birds
are down there.

11:29.167 --> 11:31.300
He'll point, just like a
pointing dog would.

11:31.500 --> 11:33.200
It's a pretty cool
hunting partner.

11:37.700 --> 11:40.133
It's a long-ass shot.
They're way the
hell out there.

Nope.

that I brought with me.

there pushing them that way.

What are you doing, dummy?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.867

got a little excited.

12:18.100 --> 12:20.533

Buck fever?

12:21.167 --> 12:22.700
He got a little fox fever.

12:22.767 --> 12:25.000
And he pushed 'em
a little early and in
the wrong direction.

I'm gonna expend

Ptarmigan are the gift
that keep on giving.

is to go down and go knock
some holes in the ice.

13:29.900 --> 13:31.467
I'm gonna go
to a shallow place.

We have a lot of

I'm gonna go walk
out there and test it
with my ice chisel.

walk out there myself

setting our traps.

Last year, at this time,
the ice was much thicker.

to take my kids on it.

14:32.833 --> 14:35.567

when the ice isn't thick,

14:38.033 --> 14:39.267
I'm staying close to shore.

A lot of animals out in this
country are real lean.

25:10.533 --> 25:12.467
It's hard to get enough fat
off the land a lot of times.

25:12.533 --> 25:15.133
But porcupines are one
good source of fat.

25:15.200 --> 25:16.467
This will be tasty.

25:22.533 --> 25:24.567
Cut the head off. Here we go.

25:25.733 --> 25:26.967
There.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.267
Cut the hide off,
didn't get any quills in me.

25:30.333 --> 25:31.833
Now I just got to get
the guts out.

25:33.400 --> 25:35.967
It's interesting how one thing
leads to the next out here.

25:36.033 --> 25:39.267
So often the case,
I'll head out thinking that
I'm looking for one thing,

25:39.333 --> 25:40.900
but along the way,
I find something else.

25:40.967 --> 25:43.400
Can't be too choosy and I
really like eating porcupine,

25:43.467 --> 25:45.967
so I'm real happy
even though I didn't
find any caribou today.

25:46.933 --> 25:48.733
That's the way it goes.
It keeps life interesting.

25:50.767 --> 25:52.367
Time to get back to camp.

25:53.000 --> 25:54.667
Go home and cook
up some porcupine.

just different.

NARRATOR: In order to avoid
a catastrophic fall
through the ice,

26:25.300 --> 26:28.933
Jessie and his dogs
were forced to push
his sled to the limit.

26:29.000 --> 26:32.567
Making repairs
before the onslaught
of winter is crucial.

26:34.300 --> 26:36.233
JESSIE: The sled
that I'm hauling wood
here in,

26:36.300 --> 26:38.633
handlebar's completely
broken off of now.

26:40.733 --> 26:42.767
Just not a strong
side structure.

26:44.567 --> 26:46.100
But very good runners,

26:46.167 --> 26:49.267
so that's why I wanna
take a little time here
and rebuild this.

26:49.833 --> 26:53.367
I just have to go look around,
scavenge stuff out of
my sled graveyard,

26:54.067 --> 26:58.067
and do what I can do to get
this thing going down
and hauling some wood better.

26:58.133 --> 27:00.333
So I'm gonna leave
this back stanchion.

27:00.400 --> 27:02.533
This is what we call
a stanchion, right here.

27:02.600 --> 27:06.700
This is the upright
part of the sled
and there's three, four,

27:06.767 --> 27:08.600
depends on the
design of the sled.

27:08.667 --> 27:10.200
But I'm gonna
remove these stanchions

27:10.267 --> 27:13.067
because they're not
that great a wood,
and they're breaking.

27:13.133 --> 27:15.100
You can see right here,
that's broke already.

27:15.167 --> 27:17.100
And I need to haul
a lot of stuff in this,

27:17.167 --> 27:19.667
so I need to rebuild this
to where it's gonna
hold my load well.

27:20.200 --> 27:21.333
Not flex so much.

27:22.567 --> 27:25.267
Winter is just beginning
for me and the work's
just starting,

27:25.333 --> 27:27.600
so this is just the
next project on my list,

27:27.667 --> 27:29.833
which is followed by
a hundred projects.

27:29.900 --> 27:32.367
But I learnt how to fix sleds
because I don't have
a lot of money

27:32.467 --> 27:34.833
to buy things
that are new and built.

27:44.533 --> 27:48.600
So I've got myself
two sturdy stanchions
added to this.

27:49.967 --> 27:53.167
I'm gonna try to put
some sides on it
that are out of plywood.

27:58.167 --> 28:00.100
Everything out here,
it's rough on things,

28:00.167 --> 28:02.267
and you have to
constantly maintain things

28:02.333 --> 28:03.800
and be able to
fix them yourself.

28:11.100 --> 28:12.133
Brr!

before it gets dark.

28:27.600 --> 28:29.667
Yeah, that's making it
nice and stable.

28:31.067 --> 28:32.900
It's gonna be great
for hauling wood.

28:32.967 --> 28:34.567
A lot better
than it was before,

28:34.633 --> 28:36.367
and it already
was hauling a lot of wood.

to bring it inside,

and get ready for tomorrow.

you just wander into.

28:48.900 --> 28:52.433
It is a committed decision
to excel and overachieve.

29:05.200 --> 29:09.000
What I'm doing now
is I have two coolers in there

29:09.067 --> 29:11.833
and I want to start
refilling them with snow
so that they melt.

very quietly, as I can
on the snow,

30:27.033 --> 30:28.567
choose my path

and get close enough
to try and shoot him.

It's a lot better
than it was before.

34:04.167 --> 34:06.467
But now I got to put
it to use here.

34:07.133 --> 34:09.600
This is the wood
that I got two days ago,

34:09.667 --> 34:13.567
so I made it two days
of cooking dog food and
keeping my house warm.

34:14.600 --> 34:17.100
So it's a beautiful day,
it's warmed up a little bit,

with a load of wood,

a trail in there.

in there now with the
snow the way it is

34:43.500 --> 34:45.133
before it gets
deeper and colder.

34:46.167 --> 34:48.600
It's easier on the dogs
to break this trail in now,

34:48.667 --> 34:51.467

this all winter

One thing's for sure,
you don't need outside
motivation or anything

35:04.167 --> 35:07.367
to get wood because it's an
environmental motivation here.

35:08.567 --> 35:12.533
It only gets colder in
Alaska in the winter so,
having the wood, man,

35:12.633 --> 35:14.833
you're pretty motivated
to get it.

out your winter.

willing to go out
and work for it.

Take advantage of
when you're healthy and
everything's going great

35:22.667 --> 35:24.633

into getting some wood.

what's gonna happen.

Any fish that's dead
in our net or on our line,

38:30.400 --> 38:32.900
we just classify as dog food
because our dogs have to eat.

38:32.967 --> 38:34.867
It's kind of like finding
a dead caribou.

38:34.933 --> 38:36.567
You don't know
what killed it,
you don't eat it.

38:37.433 --> 38:39.867
What we need is fresh meat,
not dead on the line,

38:39.933 --> 38:42.300
like, from drifting there
or being sick or smogged out.

38:42.500 --> 38:44.233
AGNES: Let's go check
the other one.

38:44.300 --> 38:46.833
Hopefully, the other one will
be alive. Let's go see.

38:48.900 --> 38:50.567
Right on, Qutan, thank you.

38:50.633 --> 38:52.900
CHIP: For now,
I'm really happy
I got something for my dogs

38:52.967 --> 38:54.200
to get them through
the next couple days,

38:54.267 --> 38:55.500
and we just keep on fishing.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.667
-Here's another fish.
-AGNES: Ooh!

38:59.867 --> 39:03.033
-Another Tiktaalik!
-CHIP: No, not alive.

39:03.100 --> 39:04.467
Bummer.

39:04.700 --> 39:07.533
We used this type of fishing
because we couldn't
cross the river.

39:07.600 --> 39:09.733
But now the river's frozen
solid and we can go anywhere.

39:09.800 --> 39:12.367
We can go where the fish are
and carry on.

39:13.467 --> 39:16.333
You know what, kids?
We had a really bad
whitefish season

39:16.400 --> 39:18.033
because of this
late freeze-up.

39:18.267 --> 39:20.100
And the dogs got to eat.

39:20.167 --> 39:22.300
So when you get dead fish,
you feed 'em to dogs.

39:22.567 --> 39:25.200
If these fish were alive
and squirming,
we'd keep 'em for ourselves.

39:25.267 --> 39:27.500
So, not all is lost.

39:27.600 --> 39:30.133
So we should be happy
that our dogs will eat good.

39:30.200 --> 39:32.100
This is some of the best food
there is for 'em.

39:32.167 --> 39:36.867
This ice is so thick,
it's frozen solid out there,
we can travel now.

39:36.933 --> 39:38.467
The time for doing
this is over.

39:39.900 --> 39:43.467
I made myself a new tuk,
which is an ice chisel that
we use to get through the ice.

39:43.533 --> 39:45.767
Since we've been down here
checking Tiktaalik traps

39:45.833 --> 39:47.800
and using that chisel
and opening up these holes
every day,

39:47.867 --> 39:49.933
we've been able to check
the progress of the ice.

39:50.000 --> 39:52.133
Now the ice is thick enough
all the way across the river,

39:52.200 --> 39:55.267
we can go to where the fish
are instead of trying to bait
the fish to where we are.

39:55.333 --> 39:56.967
So I think fishing's gonna
get better.

39:57.033 --> 39:59.100
I'm pretty happy with this tuk
and I'm gonna be using
it a lot,

39:59.167 --> 40:01.300
because it's an ice tool
in the land of ice and snow.

40:01.367 --> 40:03.033
-Shall we go home?
-AGNES: Yep.

40:03.100 --> 40:06.100
CHIP: The worst day of fishing
is better than the best
day at work.

40:06.167 --> 40:07.600
We just keep on fishing.

40:14.067 --> 40:16.600
GLENN: I've always
got a lot more to do
than I have time to.

40:17.100 --> 40:19.700
Not necessarily just work
that has to be done,

40:19.767 --> 40:21.767
but things I want to see,
things I want to learn about.

40:34.167 --> 40:37.433
Didn't find any caribou out
there, but I was lucky enough
to get a porcupine.

40:38.700 --> 40:41.733
I've eaten muskrats,
I've eaten squirrels,

40:41.800 --> 40:44.267
but if I'm gonna eat
a rodent, there's nothing
better than a porcupine.

40:44.567 --> 40:46.433
Because of this. Fat!

40:47.600 --> 40:48.700
Fat's hard to come by.

40:48.767 --> 40:50.433
A lot of animals out here
are really lean,

40:50.500 --> 40:51.967
but this porcupine,
as you can see,

40:52.033 --> 40:53.833
he's got a good layer
of fat on him.

40:53.900 --> 40:56.567
Fat has more
calories than protein
or carbohydrates,

40:56.633 --> 40:59.067
and you need a lot of calories
to stay warm.

40:59.133 --> 41:00.467
It takes energy.

41:00.533 --> 41:03.067
That's why porcupine is a
special food for me out here.

41:04.033 --> 41:06.933
Look at that.
I got a front leg,
I got a back leg,

41:07.000 --> 41:08.700
and plenty of fat
to go with that meat.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.100
That's what I'm having for
dinner tonight, porcupine.

41:14.900 --> 41:16.800
Everybody has to decide
how they want to live,

41:16.867 --> 41:18.467
where they want
to get their food.

41:18.533 --> 41:20.233
This is just the way
I choose to do it,
because I enjoy it.

41:20.300 --> 41:22.000
I enjoy living out here,
I enjoy the lifestyle.

41:22.067 --> 41:24.500
I feel more connected
to my surroundings.

41:26.633 --> 41:28.300
I don't think
this is for everybody.

41:30.500 --> 41:32.500
But I think, unfortunately,
there are a lot of people

41:32.567 --> 41:34.000
that aren't doing
what they love to do,

41:34.067 --> 41:35.767
and that's too bad
to let life go by

41:35.833 --> 41:37.400
and not do
what you really want to do.

41:37.467 --> 41:39.333
If you really wanna do
something, you ought to
get out and do it.

41:39.400 --> 41:41.300
This is what I want to do,
so this is what I did.

41:50.100 --> 41:51.667
I bet it's just about done.

41:52.167 --> 41:54.367
Oh, yeah.
That looks delicious!

41:54.433 --> 41:57.567
Look at that porcupine.
Mmm, does that smell good.

41:58.233 --> 41:59.700
Look at that.

42:01.300 --> 42:03.800
Full moon,
what a night to eat out.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.667
I eat mostly moose,
and then caribou comes next,

42:08.733 --> 42:10.667
but once in a while,
I come across something
like a porcupine,

42:10.733 --> 42:11.833
get a little variety.

42:12.033 --> 42:13.967
That's porcupine fat.
It's good stuff.

42:14.800 --> 42:16.900
Mmm. Mmm.

42:18.833 --> 42:20.433
That's the best part
right there.

42:20.500 --> 42:22.267
It is a little sprucey.

42:22.333 --> 42:24.233
He's been feeding
on spruce bark lately.

42:25.133 --> 42:26.800
Connects me
to the forest around here.

42:26.867 --> 42:28.600
The food tastes
a little bit like the area.

42:35.300 --> 42:37.167
You can't just go to the store
up here and say,

42:37.233 --> 42:39.900
"Hey, tonight I want to eat
pork chops."

42:39.967 --> 42:42.900
You got to go out and see
what nature's got
to offer you to eat.

42:42.967 --> 42:44.267
Today it offered me porcupine.

42:45.200 --> 42:48.300
A lot of times, I don't know
what the day's gonna bring.

42:48.367 --> 42:49.867
That's what makes
life interesting.

42:49.933 --> 42:51.533
You never know
what today's gonna bring.

42:51.600 --> 42:54.900
You never know exactly
what you're gonna be
eating for dinner either.

42:55.133 --> 42:56.833
What a night.

42:56.900 --> 42:58.200
It's beautiful out here.
