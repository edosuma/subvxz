WEBVTT

00:01.468 --> 00:02.803
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: All right,
 all right, lots to catch up on.

00:02.836 --> 00:05.539
Jane was trying to balance
 motherhood with grad school.

00:05.573 --> 00:08.042
Making things harder:
 the evil classmate

00:08.076 --> 00:10.278
who wrote an exposé
 about Rafael's family.

00:10.311 --> 00:12.746
Oh, and speaking of family
 drama, Jane's father, Rogelio,

00:12.780 --> 00:14.615
invested all his money
 into his passion project.

00:14.648 --> 00:17.118
Unfortunately, it decked...
What?!

00:17.151 --> 00:19.820
leaving him broke, until
 he finds his next telenovela.

00:19.853 --> 00:22.656
And speaking of telenovelas,
 we have not one,

00:22.690 --> 00:24.458
but two crime lords
 on the loose.

00:24.492 --> 00:26.627
The first, Rose,
 aka Sin Rostro,

00:26.660 --> 00:28.796
aka Luisa's great love.

00:28.829 --> 00:30.531
And then there's Mutter.

00:30.564 --> 00:32.533
I know, cray cray, right?

00:32.566 --> 00:34.768
Also crazy: Petra's mother
 killed someone.

00:34.802 --> 00:37.738
And Petra had to help
 dispose of the body.

00:37.771 --> 00:39.373
And then there's Jane.

00:39.407 --> 00:41.675
See, she wanted to be
 with Detective Michael,

00:41.709 --> 00:43.411
until this happened...
You turned me in?!

00:43.444 --> 00:44.645
This entitled ass
cost me my job.

00:44.678 --> 00:46.347
(Mateo cries)

00:46.380 --> 00:47.715
But it seemed
 Michael was wrong.

00:47.748 --> 00:49.217
It wasn't Rafael.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.718
I'm Eric Wu,
and I'm here to talk

00:50.751 --> 00:52.620
about my friend Nadine Hansen.

00:52.653 --> 00:54.588
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 So Jane said good-bye to him.

00:54.622 --> 00:56.590
But then she discovered this.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.692
ERIC: You paid me to lie
to the cops about Cordero.

00:58.726 --> 01:00.661
JANE:
 I think you hired someone

01:00.694 --> 01:02.730
to go to the police
 and lie about Michael.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.598
You told me to fight
for our family, and I was.
Stop it.

01:04.632 --> 01:06.667
Will you...?
Let me by.

01:06.700 --> 01:08.602
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Which is where we left off.

01:10.604 --> 01:11.772
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted

01:11.805 --> 01:14.108
that Jane at six years old

01:14.142 --> 01:15.676
was a lot like our Jane now.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.645
She was kind.

01:17.678 --> 01:19.647
She was smart.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.649
And she was a rule follower.

01:21.682 --> 01:24.285
XIOMARA:
I'm sorry, Janie.

01:24.318 --> 01:25.686
I was craving
chocolate last night.

01:25.719 --> 01:28.589
However, there was one way

01:28.622 --> 01:30.591
in which she was
 very, very different.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.426
Janie.

01:32.460 --> 01:34.262
Stay calm.

01:34.295 --> 01:35.796
(screams)

01:43.637 --> 01:44.838
I can't help it.

02:03.591 --> 02:05.593
Cheese.

02:10.264 --> 02:12.233
You, Abuela.

02:12.266 --> 02:13.734
Ay.

02:13.767 --> 02:14.768
(chuckles)

02:22.976 --> 02:25.179
Lists.

02:26.980 --> 02:29.950
And for "M," Mr. Monkey.

02:29.983 --> 02:32.920
Ah.

02:34.688 --> 02:37.458
No "A," I spell it in English.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.893
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I told you she was smart.

02:39.927 --> 02:41.329
Okay...

02:45.333 --> 02:48.302
That Christmas, Jane got
 an outer space puzzle,

02:48.336 --> 02:51.305
a Home Alone video tape and
 an anger management technique

02:51.339 --> 02:53.341
that would last a lifetime...

02:55.343 --> 02:56.944
...which she really needed,

02:56.977 --> 02:59.613
after what just happened
 with Rafael.

03:04.518 --> 03:07.488
Oh, right, eventually
 Jane grew out of Mr. Monkey

03:07.521 --> 03:09.490
and the "M" became Michael,

03:09.523 --> 03:11.492
which only made matters
 worse right now.

03:11.525 --> 03:13.327
JANE: Michael was right
 this whole time.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.962
Rafael paid someone
to turn him in,

03:14.995 --> 03:17.931
and he's been lying to me
for six months.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.268
I know.

03:20.301 --> 03:21.702
Are you gonna
tell Michael?

03:21.735 --> 03:23.437
What good would that do?!

03:23.471 --> 03:25.273
He's still be fired, plus he
doesn't even want to see me.

03:25.306 --> 03:26.974
Why are you
yelling at me?
I'm sorry!

03:27.007 --> 03:28.342
I'm just so mad!

03:28.376 --> 03:29.343
(Mateo cries)

03:29.377 --> 03:30.378
(sighs)

03:48.729 --> 03:49.897
Look, as angry
as I am at Rafael,

03:49.930 --> 03:52.866
and I am very,
very angry...

03:52.900 --> 03:54.902
(breathes deeply)

03:54.935 --> 03:56.937
...I'm gonna deal with him
for Mateo's sake.

03:58.339 --> 04:01.809
Because that lying
two-faced liar

04:01.842 --> 04:04.244
is not gonna ruin
his first Christmas!

04:05.813 --> 04:07.014
I'm really sorry?

04:08.849 --> 04:11.985
Are you excited to meet Santa,
Mr. Sweetface?

04:12.019 --> 04:14.855
'Cause he's excited
to see you, yes, he is.

04:17.524 --> 04:19.527
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Remember, calm, Jane.

04:23.897 --> 04:25.499
Didn't know
you were coming.

04:25.533 --> 04:28.001
Well, it was on the
calendar, so...

04:29.603 --> 04:31.572
Look, I am
sorry, Jane.

04:31.605 --> 04:34.575
I know what I
did was wrong.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.944
I just felt my family
slipping away.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.979
So you paid someone to go
to the police and lie.

04:39.012 --> 04:41.315
What he said about Michael
letting Nadine go was the truth.

04:41.349 --> 04:44.318
Oh, so you don't actually
regret what you did.

04:44.352 --> 04:46.387
I didn't have a choice.

04:46.420 --> 04:47.988
Look, Michael put
Mateo in danger,

04:48.021 --> 04:49.857
and you were too blinded
by your feelings to see it.

04:49.890 --> 04:51.859
I can't believe you are trying
to justify what you did.

04:51.892 --> 04:53.427
You were jealous
of Michael.
Whoa, jealous?

04:53.461 --> 04:54.962
And because you have money
and rules don't apply to you,

04:54.995 --> 04:56.730
or laws for that matter!
I was protecting my son!

04:56.764 --> 04:58.332
Ugh!
SANTA: Ho, ho, ho.

04:58.366 --> 04:59.433
No fighting at the North Pole.

04:59.467 --> 05:01.369
Stay out of this,
Santa, okay?

05:07.441 --> 05:10.444
("Deck the Halls" plays)

05:12.446 --> 05:14.415
Excuse me, I couldn't
help overhearing,

05:14.448 --> 05:17.951
and I just have to say I know
what you're going through.

05:17.985 --> 05:19.953
Hmm?
Well, my husband and I,

05:19.987 --> 05:21.955
we turned into Bill
and Betty Bickerberg

05:21.989 --> 05:23.991
those first six months.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.660
But it wasn't good
for the baby.

05:26.694 --> 05:28.562
Couples therapy
really helped us.

05:30.831 --> 05:32.800
JANE (indignantly):
 I don't need therapy.

05:32.833 --> 05:34.368
He could use some therapy.

05:34.402 --> 05:35.836
I mean, he doesn't even
regret what he did.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.608
Yes.

05:40.641 --> 05:42.976
I know... I know.

05:43.010 --> 05:44.912
Green card?

05:48.181 --> 05:49.983
I don't know,
I just feel like I need

05:50.017 --> 05:51.151
to be away from Rafael
right now.

05:51.184 --> 05:53.153
Yeah, I get that.

05:53.186 --> 05:55.456
Why don't I pick up Mateo later?

05:55.489 --> 05:57.057
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aw...

05:57.090 --> 05:58.692
You can always count
 on your mom

05:58.726 --> 05:59.960
to help out with child care.

06:01.662 --> 06:03.063
Or to bleach the blood

06:03.096 --> 06:05.098
of a murdered man
 off your floor.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.935
Petra, it's done.

06:07.968 --> 06:10.103
No, it's not, I can
still see the blood.

06:10.137 --> 06:11.972
Easy there, Lady Macbeth.

06:12.005 --> 06:13.040
Divka.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.808
Divka, relax.
What?

06:14.842 --> 06:17.645
How? You... you killed a man.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.713
We buried him.

06:19.747 --> 06:21.715
No, Ivan is missing.

06:21.749 --> 06:23.551
And statistically,

06:23.584 --> 06:25.953
if he is not found
in the first 48 hours,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.555
they will not find him.

06:27.588 --> 06:29.523
Huh, I bet she learned
that in prison.

06:30.591 --> 06:32.092
Don't worry.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.094
Just 24 hours left.

06:34.127 --> 06:35.963
ROGELIO:
 What?!

06:35.996 --> 06:38.131
I can't afford to buy pizza?!

06:38.165 --> 06:40.634
Don't be so dramatic;
you can order pizza.

06:40.668 --> 06:43.937
Just not from a place with
"osteria" in the name.

06:43.971 --> 06:46.139
Here, the Pizza Highway.

06:46.173 --> 06:47.975
(gasps)
If you want to find
your next passion project,

06:48.008 --> 06:50.077
you're gonna have to stick
to Jane's budget.

06:50.110 --> 06:51.512
Fine!

06:57.818 --> 07:00.654
Would you be so kind
to order me a pauper's pizza?

07:00.688 --> 07:02.556
Just cheese.

07:02.590 --> 07:04.558
Will do.
How are
the scripts?

07:04.592 --> 07:06.660
Are they full
of passion?

07:06.694 --> 07:08.061
Intrigue?

07:08.095 --> 07:09.997
De la Vega flava?

07:10.030 --> 07:12.833
Nah, it's, uh, pretty
clichéd actually.

07:12.866 --> 07:14.167
Like, identity-swap stuff.

07:14.201 --> 07:16.670
I'm leaving, I'm getting Mateo.
Okay.

07:16.704 --> 07:18.706
I really hope they
make up for Christmas.

07:18.739 --> 07:20.107
Jane and Rafael?
(laughs)

07:20.140 --> 07:21.542
Not happening.

07:21.575 --> 07:22.543
She's pissed.

07:22.576 --> 07:24.845
Like,
seriously pissed.

07:24.878 --> 07:26.880
And I don't blame her.

07:29.650 --> 07:32.052
*

07:32.085 --> 07:36.189
JD, can I ask you something,
celeb to normal person?

07:36.223 --> 07:37.190
Shoot.

07:37.224 --> 07:38.626
Let's say
I was really tight

07:38.659 --> 07:39.960
with my daughter's
ex-boyfriend,

07:39.993 --> 07:42.796
but they're no longer
on speaking terms,

07:42.830 --> 07:44.898
what's the protocol,
you know, for him and I?

07:44.932 --> 07:47.100
Oh, uh, yeah, that's...
that's pretty cut and dried.

07:47.134 --> 07:48.702
You cannot stay friends.

07:48.736 --> 07:50.738
That's what I thought.

07:55.976 --> 07:58.946
Okay, um, we wanted to catch
you up, 'cause there have been

07:58.979 --> 08:01.281
some important
developments in the case.

08:01.314 --> 08:04.618
We have reason to believe that
the crime lord known as Mutter

08:04.652 --> 08:08.255
is actually Luisa Alver's
mother, Mia Alver,

08:08.288 --> 08:10.057
who was presumed dead.

08:10.090 --> 08:13.060
we think Mutter kidnapped Luisa
to send a message to Rose.

08:13.093 --> 08:14.227
(tapping on glass)
She's here.

08:16.029 --> 08:18.198
Hey, guys, so weird
that you called me

08:18.231 --> 08:20.000
because I was
about to call you.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.234
I think my mother
might be alive.

08:25.205 --> 08:28.208
Okay, Luisa, let's have
a little chat in private.

08:28.241 --> 08:31.178
Oh, sure.

08:31.211 --> 08:34.014
Oh, God, please don't read
that terrible article

08:34.047 --> 08:35.215
about my family.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.751
I was taken totally
out of context.

08:40.688 --> 08:42.690
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And here's the guy
 who took her out of context.

08:51.965 --> 08:53.734
Oh, great.

08:53.767 --> 08:55.769
Not what she needs today.
What are you doing here?

08:55.803 --> 08:57.170
Don't you have another
friendship to exploit

08:57.204 --> 08:59.006
so that you can advance
your journalism career?

08:59.039 --> 09:00.207
I'm sorry
if you felt betrayed,

09:00.240 --> 09:01.274
but that was
a really great story,

09:01.308 --> 09:03.076
and you weren't using it.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.277
That's because
it's not a story.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.146
It's my son's family.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.915
Which is why I'm
going to the dean.

09:07.948 --> 09:09.282
Because there must be
some clause to kick out

09:09.316 --> 09:11.018
some evil, amoral
little piece of...

09:11.051 --> 09:14.021
You know what, I would tell you
 what Jane said next,

09:14.054 --> 09:15.555
but I'm a gentleman.

09:17.891 --> 09:19.126
Hi, I'm Jane Villanueva,

09:19.159 --> 09:20.961
and I'd like to make an
appointment with the dean.

09:20.994 --> 09:21.962
Urgently.

09:21.995 --> 09:24.331
But very respectfully.

09:24.364 --> 09:27.200
Oh, did you decide to enroll
next semester after all?

09:27.234 --> 09:29.269
What are you talking about?
I'm a full-time grad student.

09:29.302 --> 09:31.672
Oh, well, since you didn't
pay tuition next semester,

09:31.705 --> 09:33.273
we assumed you were taking
a little time off.

09:33.306 --> 09:35.108
No, I have the Elodea Gale
Vigor scholarship.

09:35.142 --> 09:37.344
It covers the whole year.

09:37.377 --> 09:38.345
Elodea who?

09:38.378 --> 09:40.347
There's a need-based scholarship

09:40.380 --> 09:41.982
for creative writing students

09:42.015 --> 09:43.183
whose writing
the committee loves.

09:44.351 --> 09:46.286
It's $15,000 per semester.

09:46.319 --> 09:47.955
Holy crap!

09:47.988 --> 09:50.658
Oh, my God, this solves
all my tuition problems.
Yes.

09:50.691 --> 09:52.660
A need-based scholarship
for students

09:52.693 --> 09:55.195
whose writing
the committee loves?

09:56.730 --> 09:58.131
Look, there's got to be
a way to find out

09:58.165 --> 10:00.367
where the money came from.

10:00.400 --> 10:03.904
There's a phone number
associated with the payments.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.739
Here you go.
Thank you.

10:05.773 --> 10:07.741
(phone line rings)

10:07.775 --> 10:10.377
ROGELIO: * It's another
beautiful day to call Rogelio *

10:10.410 --> 10:12.212
* Leave me a message

10:12.245 --> 10:13.647
* I'll call you back.

10:13.681 --> 10:15.048
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Uh-oh.

10:15.082 --> 10:16.650
The same Rogelio de la Vega

10:16.684 --> 10:17.785
who can't afford
 pizza toppings?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.157
So first, I just wanted
to clear everything up

10:24.191 --> 10:27.127
and say that I'm still
enrolled, definitely.

10:27.160 --> 10:29.730
Your father made up
a fake scholarship?

10:29.763 --> 10:31.431
Yes.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.166
I know, he's a bit eccentric.

10:33.200 --> 10:34.401
In any case, I was wondering

10:34.434 --> 10:36.003
if there were
any TA positions left.

10:36.036 --> 10:37.771
I do have teaching experience.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.239
Yeah, you know, I'm sorry.

10:39.272 --> 10:40.874
Not this late in the game.

10:43.276 --> 10:46.013
You know what?
This won't solve your problem,

10:46.046 --> 10:47.915
but I think it could help
chip away a little.

10:47.948 --> 10:50.751
Um, there is
a nice cash prize

10:50.784 --> 10:52.152
for a short
story submission.

10:52.185 --> 10:53.386
I have tons of short stories.

10:53.420 --> 10:56.156
In one of the following genres?

10:56.189 --> 10:57.791
Uh, historical fiction,

10:57.825 --> 11:00.093
thriller, and sci-fi.

11:00.127 --> 11:01.695
I can write a new short story.

11:01.729 --> 11:03.230
Which category, do you think?

11:03.263 --> 11:04.732
I'm not sure.
Why don't you write

11:04.765 --> 11:06.767
a few pages on each
and I'll help you pick?

11:06.800 --> 11:08.201
Oh. Okay.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.469
No problem. Great.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.271
Go. Write like the wind.

11:11.304 --> 11:12.906
Whoosh!

11:14.942 --> 11:17.010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of
 Elodea Gale Vigor...

11:17.044 --> 11:18.378
Great coffee, right?

11:18.411 --> 11:20.914
Oh. I don't think
it was worth the drive...

11:20.948 --> 11:22.349
Oh, my God, JD.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.851
Look who's here.

11:23.884 --> 11:25.185
I guess I might as well
go and say hi.

11:25.218 --> 11:26.219
Excuse me.

11:26.253 --> 11:28.255
Ex-Excuse me. Excuse me.

11:30.423 --> 11:31.892
Michael.

11:31.925 --> 11:34.795
What a surprise.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.263
This is my coffee place.

11:36.296 --> 11:37.931
We've been here together,
like, 20 times.

11:37.965 --> 11:40.200
I know.

11:40.233 --> 11:42.502
Well, what's...
what's going on, Rogelio?

11:42.535 --> 11:45.906
I miss you.
I mean,

11:45.939 --> 11:48.275
we were in a pretty
serious bromance.

11:48.308 --> 11:49.910
Oh, I don't know
if it was a bromance.

11:49.943 --> 11:51.144
Thank you.

11:51.178 --> 11:52.880
Michael, come on.

11:52.913 --> 11:55.082
There are some
things going on

11:55.115 --> 11:57.217
and you give such good advice.

11:57.250 --> 11:59.319
So... I was thinking,

11:59.352 --> 12:02.522
if I asked Jane
and she okayed the friendship,

12:02.555 --> 12:04.992
could we...

12:05.025 --> 12:07.427
maybe... hang?

12:07.460 --> 12:09.262
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 It should be noted

12:09.296 --> 12:11.331
that this is what Michael
 wanted to say.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.301
Sure, bro. You crack me up.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.469
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And this is what
 he actually said.

12:16.503 --> 12:19.139
I just think
it's-it's better for me

12:19.172 --> 12:21.341
if we all kind of...

12:21.374 --> 12:23.443
move on.

12:23.476 --> 12:26.446
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And this is what
 Rogelio wanted to say.

12:26.479 --> 12:28.248
Really?

12:28.281 --> 12:29.850
Just like that?

12:29.883 --> 12:31.318
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.753
That's what he actually said.

12:38.525 --> 12:41.829
Decaf chai cinnamon latte.
Extra wet.

12:41.862 --> 12:44.231
Thought you were fired.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh. These two

12:44.264 --> 12:45.833
haven't seen each other
 in a while.

12:45.866 --> 12:48.168
Probation. Good looking out,
though, thank you.

12:48.201 --> 12:49.402
SUSANNA:
Okay.

12:49.436 --> 12:50.904
Now that you have
your brother

12:50.938 --> 12:52.372
and your special tea,

12:52.405 --> 12:53.573
you want to talk to us
about your mother?

12:53.606 --> 12:56.376
Uh, sure. I just, um...

12:56.409 --> 12:57.845
I don't remember much.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.213
I was...
I was six

13:00.247 --> 13:01.248
when she died.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.383
When-when she didn't die.

13:03.416 --> 13:05.185
(sighs)

13:05.218 --> 13:06.820
There's something
on another topic, though.

13:06.854 --> 13:08.088
Make it quick.

13:08.121 --> 13:10.257
Sure.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.359
I've been communicating
with Rose online

13:12.392 --> 13:13.426
for the past six months.

13:13.460 --> 13:14.928
Wait, what?

13:14.962 --> 13:16.363
I'm sorry.
How?

13:16.396 --> 13:18.265
Nothing crime-related, though.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.599
Just... just
personal stuff.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.034
Light role-play, um,

13:21.068 --> 13:22.169
there's-there's a Web site...

13:22.202 --> 13:23.436
I'll get a secure computer.

13:23.470 --> 13:25.138
What's the name of the Web site?

13:25.172 --> 13:26.506
MICHAEL:
No, no!

13:26.539 --> 13:28.041
When was the last time
you talked to her?

13:28.075 --> 13:30.343
Like... a week ago?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.989
Ma, he's gonna tell you
the same answer

13:42.022 --> 13:43.490
on the phone or in person.

13:44.892 --> 13:47.060
He doesn't know
when your green card will come.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.466
Okay, I have a plan
of attack. One--

13:53.500 --> 13:55.202
win fiction writing contest.

13:55.235 --> 13:57.337
Two-- trade in my car
for a cheaper one.

13:57.370 --> 13:59.206
Three-- waitress again.

13:59.239 --> 14:01.341
At night, of course.
Four-- take out a very,

14:01.374 --> 14:03.143
very limited loan.

14:03.176 --> 14:05.445
(knocking)
Five-- tell your father.

14:05.478 --> 14:08.081
No. And don't either of you
say anything, please.

14:08.115 --> 14:09.917
I put him on a budget,

14:09.950 --> 14:13.153
and I don't want him
compromising because of me.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.423
Hey, Dad.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.391
Jane!
(laughs) Mwah!

14:18.425 --> 14:20.460
Matelio.
Hey, JD.

14:20.493 --> 14:23.396
All right,
everyone is here.

14:23.430 --> 14:27.134
Let Mateo's first
Christmas season commence.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.136
So no Rafael?

14:29.169 --> 14:30.437
No, thank God.

14:30.470 --> 14:32.472
I unlinked our calendars.

14:38.045 --> 14:40.647
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, my God!
 It's Rafael's mother.

14:42.415 --> 14:44.484
Why'd you leave?

14:44.517 --> 14:45.618
Your father

14:45.652 --> 14:49.156
offered me $10 million
to go away...

14:49.189 --> 14:51.024
and I took it.

14:55.162 --> 14:56.429
What are you doing here?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.465
The police have questions

14:58.498 --> 15:01.268
about your father's
first wife, Mia.

15:01.301 --> 15:02.535
Well, I'm sure
they'll fill you in.

15:02.569 --> 15:04.471
Rafael, wait. Please.

15:09.309 --> 15:12.045
I haven't stopped thinking
about you.

15:13.280 --> 15:16.049
There was so much more
I wanted to explain.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.018
Stop.

15:18.051 --> 15:19.519
I have a son now.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.288
Yes.
And there is no...

15:21.321 --> 15:23.556
explanation or amount of money

15:23.590 --> 15:26.426
that could ever
make me leave him.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.396
ROGELIO:
 I was thinking about

15:29.429 --> 15:32.265
the Rafael situation.
I know. It's awful.

15:32.299 --> 15:34.034
XIOMARA: What is?
JANE:
The Rafael situation.

15:34.067 --> 15:35.368
No, no. No Rafael talk.

15:35.402 --> 15:38.605
We're doing Christmas.
Ma, time for the story
about the tree topper.

16:33.060 --> 16:35.728
(electronic chime)
No, not just because
it's from Venezuela.

16:35.762 --> 16:38.531
Something with meaning.

16:38.565 --> 16:39.699
A "C."

16:39.732 --> 16:42.202
Why am I stuck?

16:42.235 --> 16:43.603
This makes no sense.
JANE: This makes no sense.

16:54.247 --> 16:56.649
(tapping keyboard)

16:57.517 --> 16:59.586
(tapping keyboard)

17:02.155 --> 17:03.523
(tapping keyboard)

17:04.523 --> 17:06.159
(tapping keyboard)

17:07.359 --> 17:09.362
(tapping keyboard)

17:14.534 --> 17:15.801
Huh.

17:27.214 --> 17:29.015
(panting)

17:32.885 --> 17:35.455
(tapping keyboard)

17:35.488 --> 17:38.625
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Remember, Jane, stay calm.

17:38.658 --> 17:40.693
*

17:42.562 --> 17:44.397
(exhales)

17:48.635 --> 17:50.670
So if I refused
to give him Mateo for Christmas,

17:50.703 --> 17:53.706
can a judge use that against
me in custody court?

17:53.740 --> 17:56.176
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, good, looks like
 she found a lawyer.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.544
I'm sorry,
but...

17:57.577 --> 17:59.179
I'm an immigration attorney.

17:59.212 --> 18:00.713
In case you were wondering,

18:00.747 --> 18:02.415
Alba got to ask
 her question already.

18:02.449 --> 18:03.750
No green card involved.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.352
Can I be frank?
Mm-hmm.

18:05.385 --> 18:07.420
The baby's father
is Rafael Solano, right?

18:07.454 --> 18:10.123
As in... this

18:10.157 --> 18:11.758
Geez,
Rafael Solano?

18:11.791 --> 18:13.560
that thing's everywhere.
Mm-hmm.

18:13.593 --> 18:16.663
Here's my advice-- get in touch
with the author of this article.

18:16.696 --> 18:17.564
What?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.466
Well, he insinuates

18:19.499 --> 18:21.601
massive financial improprieties
on Mr. Solano's part.

18:21.634 --> 18:23.136
And if
that's true,

18:23.170 --> 18:26.473
if he is involved
in ongoing criminal activities,

18:26.506 --> 18:27.607
well...

18:27.640 --> 18:29.576
you'd have a case
for full custody.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.778
Whoa.

18:31.811 --> 18:33.680
Jane.

18:35.582 --> 18:37.584
No, of course not.

18:37.617 --> 18:39.619
But I do want to know
what else he lied about.

18:39.652 --> 18:41.288
I mean, what if
it's something bad?

18:41.321 --> 18:44.524
I have to make sure
that Mateo's safe, Abuela.

18:44.557 --> 18:46.759
JANE: Wesley.
WESLEY:
What, are you

18:46.793 --> 18:48.761
following me around now
just so you can yell at me?

18:48.795 --> 18:50.663
Calm, calm.

18:51.731 --> 18:53.700
I looked in the handbook,

18:53.733 --> 18:57.304
and I can report you
to the dean for...

18:57.337 --> 18:59.472
"violating a fellow student's
reasonable expectation

18:59.506 --> 19:01.341
of confidentiality."

19:02.442 --> 19:03.843
But I won't

19:03.876 --> 19:06.779
if you reveal your source
inside the Marbella.

19:06.813 --> 19:08.815
Please... don't get me fired.

19:11.718 --> 19:14.587
I love this job...

19:14.621 --> 19:16.923
You talked about a
secret account-- where
was the money going?

19:16.956 --> 19:19.592
Uh, Rafael was being secretive;
I didn't ask.

19:20.660 --> 19:22.529
I can get you the number
of the place.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.696
And the address.

19:23.730 --> 19:26.466
Oh, Raf. What are you up to?

19:28.501 --> 19:30.403
Why aren't you
returning my calls?

19:30.437 --> 19:31.571
It's a long story.

19:31.604 --> 19:34.774
She is not taking my death well.

19:34.807 --> 19:36.643
What's going on?
I just wanted to see

19:36.676 --> 19:38.445
what time our doctor's
appointment was.

19:38.478 --> 19:39.612
Are you okay?

19:39.646 --> 19:42.249
It's just
a blood sugar thing.

19:42.282 --> 19:43.716
Petra's a
little hungry.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.485
Aren't you, darling?

19:45.518 --> 19:46.586
Yes. Don't worry.

19:46.619 --> 19:47.754
Bye-bye.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.491
Divka, great news.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.593
It's been 48 hours.

19:53.626 --> 19:55.262
Now he just decomposes.

19:55.295 --> 19:57.597
I can't do this.
I have to tell.

19:57.630 --> 19:59.599
Who? Rafael?

19:59.632 --> 20:00.800
Good.

20:00.833 --> 20:02.435
While you're at it...

20:02.469 --> 20:04.504
tell him how
you covered up for me

20:04.537 --> 20:06.606
when I pushed Jane's granny
down stairs,

20:06.639 --> 20:09.008
I'm sure he'll understand.

20:09.041 --> 20:12.345
Wow. She's a real piece
of work, your mother.

20:12.379 --> 20:13.846
SUSANNA:
 All the personal effects

20:13.880 --> 20:15.682
Luisa has from her mother.

20:15.715 --> 20:17.317
Anything interesting?

20:17.350 --> 20:19.386
Haven't looked.
Came straight over.

20:19.419 --> 20:20.653
(sighs)

20:20.687 --> 20:21.688
What's wrong? You all right?

20:21.721 --> 20:23.523
Yeah.

20:23.556 --> 20:26.693
I just think Luisa...
is flirting with me, maybe.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.595
Why do you say that?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.763
Oh, I'm sorry.

20:30.797 --> 20:34.301
Oh. Do... do I have
something there?

20:34.334 --> 20:35.635
Do you see it?

20:35.668 --> 20:39.872
Mm-mm.
Oh. Maybe it's
just my nipple.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.941
Stop. Stop laughing.

20:41.974 --> 20:43.976
(sighs)

20:46.379 --> 20:47.514
(sighs)

20:47.547 --> 20:48.681
(whispering inaudibly)

20:48.715 --> 20:49.782
What?

20:49.816 --> 20:51.818
Look. Check out the date
on this picture.

20:51.851 --> 20:55.322
It's dated two days before Mia
jumped off the bridge.

20:55.355 --> 20:58.358
Hurricane shutters.

20:58.391 --> 21:01.394
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Aha. Are you thinking
 what I'm thinking?

21:01.428 --> 21:02.895
Because I'm thinking
 I hope they tell us

21:02.929 --> 21:04.731
what they're thinking
 because I have no idea.

21:04.764 --> 21:06.299
Okay, so here's
what I'm thinking.

21:06.333 --> 21:07.634
Oh, good.
The tropical storm

21:07.667 --> 21:09.636
would have impacted
the tides and currents,

21:09.669 --> 21:11.504
so when she jumped...

21:11.538 --> 21:13.973
Our search area was too small.
Exactly.

21:14.006 --> 21:16.343
And speaking
 of breakthroughs...

21:16.376 --> 21:19.312
Oh, information
 on Raf's secret account.

21:19.346 --> 21:22.815
Jane, do you really want
 to go down this road?

21:23.750 --> 21:24.984
Ooh!

21:25.017 --> 21:26.753
That's a sketchy part of town.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.055
You definitely do not want
 to go down that road.

21:29.088 --> 21:32.492
And I guess she
 went down that road.

21:50.009 --> 21:52.011
(door closes)

21:57.984 --> 22:01.354
(gasps)

22:01.388 --> 22:03.823
Yeah, so that's what Janie

22:03.856 --> 22:05.692
imagined Rafael was up to.

22:05.725 --> 22:07.394
And what she used
 as inspiration

22:07.427 --> 22:08.895
to write her thriller,

22:08.928 --> 22:11.431
while she debated what to do

22:11.464 --> 22:13.900
about that phone number.

22:21.474 --> 22:22.842
WOMAN:
Hello?

22:22.875 --> 22:24.811
Hello.

22:24.844 --> 22:26.646
Are you there?

22:26.679 --> 22:27.780
Yes.

22:27.814 --> 22:28.948
Are you safe?

22:28.981 --> 22:32.752
Yes, I'm safe.

22:32.785 --> 22:34.954
I'm actually looking
for Rafael Solano.

22:34.987 --> 22:36.756
Are you a reporter?

22:36.789 --> 22:38.425
No. No, no, no, no, no, no.
I'm not--

22:38.458 --> 22:40.760
If this is about that article,
you should know

22:40.793 --> 22:42.662
we wouldn't be open were it not
for Mr. Solano's funding.

22:42.695 --> 22:44.464
I'm sorry, open for what?
I-I was looking online

22:44.497 --> 22:45.965
and trying to figure it out,
but I--

22:45.998 --> 22:47.667
We're a domestic abuse shelter.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.135
You won't find us online,

22:49.168 --> 22:50.703
because people who come here
don't want to be found.

22:50.737 --> 22:52.672
Wait, you're a charity?

22:52.705 --> 22:54.941
Yes, leave us alone.

22:56.609 --> 22:58.110
ROGELIO:
 Oh, no!

22:58.144 --> 23:01.681
What?
JD failed
the Prince William test!

23:01.714 --> 23:02.982
The what now?

23:03.015 --> 23:04.984
In order to see if a new friend
can be trusted,

23:05.017 --> 23:07.186
Prince William tells them a very
specific piece of information

23:07.219 --> 23:08.888
to see if it shows up
in the press.

23:08.921 --> 23:10.723
JD?
Yeah?

23:10.757 --> 23:12.792
I'm gonna tell you
a juicy piece of gossip.

23:15.462 --> 23:18.731
I once had a torrid
love affair with Charo.

23:18.765 --> 23:20.199
You slept with Charo?

23:20.232 --> 23:21.834
Of course not, but look.

23:21.868 --> 23:23.570
It's all over the Internet.

23:23.603 --> 23:25.137
(phone ringing)
(gasps)

23:25.171 --> 23:27.907
Oh, my God, it's Charo.

23:27.940 --> 23:30.176
I don't know
how I misjudged the guy.

23:30.209 --> 23:32.812
I really thought he
was gonna be my Guy Pelly.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.887
Rogelio, is everything okay?

23:40.920 --> 23:43.856
You've seemed a little...

23:43.890 --> 23:47.594
I don't know--
desperate for a friend?

23:47.627 --> 23:49.996
If you're looking for someone
to talk to it can be, you know.

23:50.029 --> 23:52.532
Come on, what is it?

23:52.565 --> 23:53.733
A budget?

23:53.766 --> 23:55.234
Not at all.

23:55.267 --> 23:57.704
Then, what's going on?

23:57.737 --> 24:00.006
Well, sometimes these...

24:00.039 --> 24:03.810
um, feelings come up.

24:03.843 --> 24:05.845
In the past,
I've talked to Michael,

24:05.878 --> 24:07.614
vent a little and get over it.

24:07.647 --> 24:10.483
But that's clearly
not appropriate anymore.

24:10.517 --> 24:12.752
What feelings exactly?

24:14.521 --> 24:15.822
Angry ones.

24:15.855 --> 24:18.825
About the 23 years

24:18.858 --> 24:20.126
you kept me from Jane.

24:20.159 --> 24:22.161
And I know it's not

24:22.194 --> 24:25.097
the same thing, but when
I see her push Rafael out

24:25.131 --> 24:26.799
and you encouraging her,

24:26.833 --> 24:29.736
it just brings it back up.

24:31.838 --> 24:34.541
Yeah, I get that.

24:34.574 --> 24:36.576
Hey.

24:37.844 --> 24:39.879
How are you?
Not great.

24:39.912 --> 24:42.048
I found out
where Rafael's money was going.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.750
To a charity.

24:43.783 --> 24:45.552
I mean,

24:45.585 --> 24:47.820
I don't know what I was
thinking, except that I was...

24:47.854 --> 24:49.822
just so mad.

24:49.856 --> 24:51.691
I know.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.027
So maybe the lady

24:55.061 --> 24:57.063
on the Santa line was right.

25:14.146 --> 25:16.949
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: Ah yes,
 here we are. At a three-starred

25:16.983 --> 25:18.284
Rate-A-Doc Reviewed therapist.
 Which was

25:18.317 --> 25:19.686
the best Jane and Rafael
 could find

25:19.719 --> 25:20.920
under such short notice.

25:20.953 --> 25:22.722
Thank you so much
for squeezing us in.

25:22.755 --> 25:23.956
Yeah.
And you're sure

25:23.990 --> 25:25.057
you're credentialed?

25:30.329 --> 25:32.565
Yes, I just have a young face.

25:32.599 --> 25:34.133
So why don't we
give you some backstory?

25:34.166 --> 25:36.569
Oh, I don't need backstory.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.204
I deal in the present.

25:38.237 --> 25:41.574
So why don't you guys
tell me why you're here?

25:41.608 --> 25:44.711
Okay, um... I just found out
that Rafael's been lying to me

25:44.744 --> 25:46.713
for six months...
I'm gonna
stop you

25:46.746 --> 25:49.949
right there. Let's avoid using
language that places blame.

25:49.982 --> 25:51.918
So instead, we'll
say "I feel".

25:51.951 --> 25:53.786
An example would be, you know,

25:53.820 --> 25:56.623
"I feel hurt that he didn't
notice my new haircut."

25:56.656 --> 25:58.324
Got it.

25:58.357 --> 26:00.226
I feel...

26:00.259 --> 26:01.728
angry.

26:01.761 --> 26:05.598
that after our son
was kidnapped by Sin Rostro

26:05.632 --> 26:07.800
and my ex-fiancé Michael
rescued him,

26:07.834 --> 26:09.669
that Rafael decided
to pay someone off

26:09.702 --> 26:10.803
to lie to the police.

26:10.837 --> 26:11.971
And I
feel angry

26:12.004 --> 26:13.339
that Jane doesn't realize

26:13.372 --> 26:14.674
that I had no choice.

26:14.707 --> 26:16.242
She was blinded by Michael

26:16.275 --> 26:18.277
and that I was trying
to protect my family.

26:20.079 --> 26:23.082
Okay, maybe I just need, like,
a teensy bit of backstory.

26:23.115 --> 26:25.652
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And speaking of a complicated
 backstory...

26:25.685 --> 26:26.853
You found my mom?

26:26.886 --> 26:28.621
We think so.

26:28.655 --> 26:30.857
We expanded our search area,
found an incident report

26:30.890 --> 26:32.725
of a woman who
washed ashore

26:32.759 --> 26:35.261
18 miles from where Emilio
saw your mother jump.

26:38.264 --> 26:40.232
She was pulled
from the water

26:40.266 --> 26:41.734
wearing a bracelet
that said "Mia",

26:41.768 --> 26:43.169
but she had a head injury,

26:43.202 --> 26:45.237
so she didn't even
know her last name.

26:47.874 --> 26:49.842
She was sent to the hospital
for treatment,

26:49.876 --> 26:52.845
then confined to...

26:52.879 --> 26:56.615
the Burnwall-Meriweather Home
for the Mentally Ill.

26:58.785 --> 27:00.753
The home was closed
about a year later

27:00.787 --> 27:03.890
and she was transferred to
a less restrictive institution.

27:05.992 --> 27:07.960
She's had access
to the outside world,

27:07.994 --> 27:09.962
sometimes for days at a time,

27:09.996 --> 27:12.331
which is what she'd need
if she were operating as

27:12.364 --> 27:15.668
the drug lord Mutter.

27:15.702 --> 27:18.905
So... what happens now?

27:20.973 --> 27:24.310
Well, that's where we
could use your help.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.678
You think that'll help?

27:25.712 --> 27:27.279
It might.
But you both seem

27:27.313 --> 27:29.048
very stuck
in your points of view.

27:29.081 --> 27:30.449
So... Jane, why don't
you take me back

27:30.482 --> 27:32.218
to the incident that
started everything,

27:32.251 --> 27:34.721
but try to tell it to me
from Rafael's point of view.

27:34.754 --> 27:37.289
Um...

27:37.323 --> 27:38.791
okay.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.326
Uh, so...

27:40.359 --> 27:42.061
I'm Rafael.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.831
And I'm lying there,

27:44.864 --> 27:46.432
and I hear that Jane
 kissed Michael,

27:46.465 --> 27:48.835
and so at first,
 I'm feeling sad.

27:48.868 --> 27:51.037
I mean...

27:51.070 --> 27:53.039
just really sad.

27:53.072 --> 27:55.074
And my heart hurts.

27:57.443 --> 27:59.411
But you know what,
 instead of saying anything,

27:59.445 --> 28:01.447
I'll pretend to be asleep.

28:01.480 --> 28:03.783
And then later, I just start
 thinking and thinking,

28:03.816 --> 28:05.251
and I say to myself:
 (chuckles)

28:05.284 --> 28:07.119
I could make
 this whole thing go away.

28:07.153 --> 28:09.722
I can get rid of Michael. All I
 have to do is pay someone off,

28:09.756 --> 28:11.123
because I'm rich.

28:11.157 --> 28:12.892
Rules? What rules?

28:12.925 --> 28:14.894
I don't like something?
 Boom, I pay my henchman.

28:14.927 --> 28:16.763
RAFAEL:
 I got a henchman now?

28:16.796 --> 28:18.798
Seriously?
You have a guy
you paid to break the law.

28:18.831 --> 28:20.800
As far as I'm concerned,
that's a henchman.

28:20.833 --> 28:22.735
Okay, my turn.

28:22.769 --> 28:24.937
I'm Jane. Ready?

28:24.971 --> 28:27.406
So, I'm in my room,
 right by the baby monitor,

28:27.439 --> 28:29.441
because that's my favorite
 place to talk.

28:29.475 --> 28:31.778
And I'm listening to Michael
 confessing how he let

28:31.811 --> 28:35.014
the person go who was involved
 in the kidnapping of my son.

28:35.047 --> 28:37.116
But you know what?
 (short chuckle) Who cares?

28:37.149 --> 28:38.785
Because it's you, Michael.

28:38.818 --> 28:40.119
It's you!
 And, sure,

28:40.152 --> 28:42.121
you've been shady,
 but I just...

28:42.154 --> 28:45.825
I love you. Even though you
 broke the law and freed Nadine,

28:45.858 --> 28:47.794
who worked for Sin Rostro,
 who kidnapped our son

28:47.827 --> 28:49.395
and killed my father.

28:52.164 --> 28:54.166
I'm sorry, I-I can't do this.

28:57.870 --> 29:00.339
I wasn't even thinking
about your father.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.874
I know.

29:01.908 --> 29:03.042
Because of Michael.

29:04.576 --> 29:07.847
And yeah, maybe I was jealous.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.850
But Sin Rostro was out there
and Michael was compromised

29:10.883 --> 29:12.852
and you couldn't see it.

29:12.885 --> 29:15.287
And I knew
that if I came forward...

29:15.321 --> 29:17.323
I would lose you.

29:20.259 --> 29:22.862
Yeah, I get that.

29:22.895 --> 29:25.798
But it was just the lying.

29:25.832 --> 29:29.301
The six months of lying.

29:30.402 --> 29:32.038
Jane, why do you think lying

29:32.071 --> 29:33.772
is such a trigger for you?

29:45.017 --> 29:46.485
Hi.

29:46.518 --> 29:47.954
I'm Luisa Alver,

29:47.987 --> 29:50.322
I'm here to visit
my mother, Mia.

29:50.356 --> 29:52.091
You're Mia's daughter?
Yeah.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.894
I know. Uh, we just found out
that she's here.

29:54.927 --> 29:56.295
It's-it's a
long story.

29:56.328 --> 29:58.097
Uh, could my wife and I

29:58.130 --> 30:00.933
see her?

30:06.205 --> 30:08.474
Mia?

30:08.507 --> 30:11.110
You have
a visitor, dear.

30:12.611 --> 30:14.513
Oh, my God.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.148
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Mamma Mia.

30:16.182 --> 30:18.150
That's not my mom.

30:18.184 --> 30:19.818
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Or not.

30:24.056 --> 30:26.292
So we're talking
a straight-up identity swap.

30:26.325 --> 30:27.459
It must be.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.262
Is she okay?

30:31.563 --> 30:34.166
MICHAEL:
Oh...

30:34.200 --> 30:36.168
Go.

30:36.202 --> 30:38.170
Talk to
your wife.

30:38.204 --> 30:39.371
(sighs)

30:39.405 --> 30:41.140
SUSANNA:
 And during a transfer

30:41.173 --> 30:44.076
of patients, the
bus broke down.

30:44.110 --> 30:47.579
And that's when we think
your mother switched I.D.s with

30:47.613 --> 30:49.081
a nonverbal patient.

30:49.115 --> 30:50.883
And ever since
then, we think

30:50.917 --> 30:54.020
she's been running her
operation as a ghost.

30:54.053 --> 30:55.554
Oh.
(chuckles)

30:55.587 --> 30:57.023
Is that all?

30:57.056 --> 31:01.127
I know.
(chuckles)

31:01.160 --> 31:03.262
Are you okay?

31:03.295 --> 31:05.264
(sniffles)
I'm just...

31:05.297 --> 31:08.600
I'm trying
to make sense of it all.

31:08.634 --> 31:12.138
I guess my mom's a psychopath.

31:13.172 --> 31:14.606
And maybe that's...

31:14.640 --> 31:16.608
why I fell in love with Rose.

31:16.642 --> 31:19.979
Why it all felt so...

31:20.012 --> 31:22.214
familiar.

31:23.249 --> 31:24.616
Yeah.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.552
Okay. Maybe.

31:35.227 --> 31:36.262
What a cliché, no?

31:36.295 --> 31:38.230
I agree. It's not that great.

31:38.264 --> 31:40.266
(doorbell rings)

31:40.299 --> 31:43.469
That's JD. Stay calm.

31:52.311 --> 31:53.980
How could you?

31:54.013 --> 31:55.281
Uh, what?

31:55.314 --> 31:56.515
Don't "uh, what" me.

31:56.548 --> 31:58.084
I know exactly what you are!

31:58.117 --> 32:00.552
A betrayer.
As slippery as they come!

32:00.586 --> 32:02.254
You're right.

32:02.288 --> 32:03.689
I'm a shape-shifter.

32:03.722 --> 32:04.556
And the fact

32:04.590 --> 32:06.025
that you know,

32:06.058 --> 32:08.094
it's a real problem.

32:08.127 --> 32:10.929
W...

32:12.198 --> 32:13.565
(gasps)

32:14.433 --> 32:15.334
XIOMARA:
I didn't.

32:15.367 --> 32:16.668
But then again, it could be me.

32:16.702 --> 32:17.703
JANE:
Mom,

32:17.736 --> 32:19.171
stop.

32:19.205 --> 32:21.940
I'm JD.

32:23.742 --> 32:27.613
CHAVEZ:
 Okay, I read all three stories.

32:27.646 --> 32:32.518
And, uh, the science fiction one
is really crazy.

32:32.551 --> 32:34.553
I know.
I-It's not my genre.

32:34.586 --> 32:36.188
So of the other two?

32:36.222 --> 32:39.358
Just go with romance.

32:39.391 --> 32:41.493
I'm sorry, what?
The contest is

32:41.527 --> 32:43.229
fiction in any genre.

32:43.262 --> 32:46.065
I Elodea Gale Vigor'd
you there, huh?

32:46.098 --> 32:47.233
What?

32:47.266 --> 32:48.567
(chuckles)

32:48.600 --> 32:50.702
Misled you for your own good.

32:50.736 --> 32:54.440
You seemed a little stuck
in your own perspective.

32:54.473 --> 32:58.210
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You know, she's actually been
 hearing that a lot lately.

32:58.244 --> 33:00.412
I gave you the historical
fiction 'cause I wanted you

33:00.446 --> 33:03.015
to get a feeling
for time and place.

33:04.116 --> 33:05.284
And then the
thriller was so that

33:05.317 --> 33:07.119
you could work
on the element of surprise.

33:08.354 --> 33:09.088
And the science fiction

33:09.121 --> 33:10.589
was...

33:10.622 --> 33:12.291
I don't know.

33:12.324 --> 33:15.294
You have to break the rules
a little more. In general.

33:17.229 --> 33:20.066
But again, that piece
didn't work at all, so...

33:20.099 --> 33:22.468
Um... just
go write

33:22.501 --> 33:24.070
a great story.

33:24.103 --> 33:26.238
The deadline is two weeks.

33:27.273 --> 33:29.708
Okay. I will.

33:31.177 --> 33:34.080
You know, but in the interest
of full disclosure,

33:34.113 --> 33:35.314
I am the tiniest bit
aggravated

33:35.347 --> 33:37.249
because I had a lot
going on this week.

33:37.283 --> 33:38.250
This might help.

33:39.285 --> 33:40.519
A T.A. position opened up.

33:40.552 --> 33:42.121
What?
Apparently,

33:42.154 --> 33:44.790
Wesley is not going to be
enrolling next semester.

33:44.823 --> 33:46.125
Seriously?

33:46.158 --> 33:47.693
That's what
I'm being told.

33:47.726 --> 33:49.595
And I-I get to have his job?

33:50.596 --> 33:52.264
(giggles)

33:52.298 --> 33:54.200
I'm sorry, but
you're fired.

33:54.233 --> 33:55.367
(scoffs)
What?

33:55.401 --> 33:56.535
You betrayed my trust

33:56.568 --> 33:57.536
by revealing
the intimate secret

33:57.569 --> 34:00.072
I shared with you to TMZ.

34:00.106 --> 34:02.174
About you and Charo?

34:02.208 --> 34:03.075
No,

34:03.109 --> 34:03.675
I didn't.

34:03.709 --> 34:05.211
Who else could it be?

34:05.244 --> 34:07.079
One of the two other people

34:07.113 --> 34:08.580
who were in the room
when you told me.

34:09.415 --> 34:10.382
I once had

34:10.416 --> 34:12.618
a torrid love affair with Charo.

34:17.322 --> 34:19.091
Rogelio!

34:19.125 --> 34:21.726
I-I'm so sorry
for doubting you.

34:21.760 --> 34:24.463
But now we can continue
to develop our friendship.

34:24.496 --> 34:26.197
I don't want to be friends
with you.

34:26.232 --> 34:28.434
Rogelio, you don't
know one thing about me.

34:28.467 --> 34:30.268
Yes, I do.

34:30.302 --> 34:33.772
You are... an intern.

34:33.804 --> 34:35.306
I'm a writer, okay?

34:35.341 --> 34:36.608
And I'm good, too.

34:38.844 --> 34:41.246
Here. Um, read my script
at some point.

34:41.280 --> 34:43.248
Or don't.

34:43.282 --> 34:45.817
Either way,
I'm-I'm done being your intern.

34:45.851 --> 34:47.386
(gasps)
But...

34:49.321 --> 34:50.322
I know what I have to do.

34:50.356 --> 34:51.489
Read his script?
Get him

34:51.523 --> 34:52.491
a wall of flowers,

34:52.524 --> 34:53.659
like Kanye gets Kim.

34:53.692 --> 34:55.460
Read the script.

34:56.495 --> 34:58.497
(sighs)

34:59.631 --> 35:00.599
JANE:
Hi, Dad.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.202
How did it go with Rafael?

35:03.235 --> 35:05.671
Good, actually.

35:07.839 --> 35:11.677
Look, I don't agree with what
he did, but I see why he did it.

35:11.710 --> 35:13.179
And the lying

35:13.212 --> 35:14.680
I'll get over.

35:14.713 --> 35:16.515
I guess I realized
it's something I'm sensitive to

35:16.548 --> 35:19.418
because of... well, you know...

35:20.586 --> 35:22.888
...the 23 years we lost.

35:22.921 --> 35:26.692
I guess it still comes up
once in a while.

35:26.725 --> 35:27.893
Yeah.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.696
W-With me, too.

35:30.729 --> 35:32.664
But you should
know that now

35:32.698 --> 35:36.268
I can't imagine life
without you.

35:36.302 --> 35:38.704
You, too.

35:38.737 --> 35:40.272
Elodea Gale Vigor.

35:40.306 --> 35:41.507
You know?

35:42.708 --> 35:44.676
Well, I'm glad

35:44.710 --> 35:46.612
I paid the whole year, you know,

35:46.645 --> 35:48.614
before all these money troubles.
(chuckles)

35:48.647 --> 35:51.750
Yeah. Good thing.
(chuckles)

35:52.518 --> 35:53.552
Come on.

35:53.585 --> 35:54.686
Let's go decorate the tree.

35:54.720 --> 35:56.388
Are you ready

35:56.422 --> 35:58.224
to put the angel on top, Mateo?

35:58.257 --> 36:00.292
Matelio. He's ready. Yes.

36:00.326 --> 36:01.960
(chuckles)
XIOMARA:
Oh, crap.

36:01.993 --> 36:05.664
I forgot.
I broke it.
What?

36:05.697 --> 36:07.499
I meant to tell you
the box fell down right before

36:07.533 --> 36:09.701
Mateo's baptism,
but things were all crazy.

36:09.735 --> 36:11.770
It's just a crack.
I'll get glue.

36:11.803 --> 36:15.541
What? But, Mom, where is it?

36:15.574 --> 36:17.243
I left it in there.
(gasps)

36:17.276 --> 36:19.711
I swear.

36:21.413 --> 36:23.715
JANE:
We'll find it.

36:23.749 --> 36:24.716
Don't worry.

36:24.750 --> 36:26.485
Should we be worried?

36:26.518 --> 36:27.686
Well, high blood pressure
isn't good.

36:27.719 --> 36:29.488
She really needs
to take it easy,

36:29.521 --> 36:32.658
reduce stress.
That's what I
keep telling her.

36:32.691 --> 36:34.860
I will. Yes.

36:34.893 --> 36:36.995
I'll have you back in next week,
to check those numbers.

36:37.028 --> 36:39.431
Thank you.
Thank you, Doctor.

36:42.468 --> 36:45.437
Okay, Petra, what's going on?

36:45.471 --> 36:48.374
Nothing. I'm fine.
No,
you're not.

36:48.407 --> 36:50.276
And whatever it is,
it's affecting the babies.

36:50.309 --> 36:51.677
So please tell me.

36:51.710 --> 36:54.513
I can't.

36:54.546 --> 36:55.914
You can.

36:55.947 --> 36:58.550
It's bad.

36:58.584 --> 36:59.818
Trust me,
I know...

36:59.851 --> 37:04.323
good people do bad things.

37:08.494 --> 37:11.597
My mother killed Ivan,
and I helped her bury the body.

37:11.630 --> 37:14.500
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah. Usually not that bad.

37:18.870 --> 37:21.507
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall, we left Petra
 confiding in Rafael.

37:21.540 --> 37:22.541
And it should be noted,

37:22.574 --> 37:23.809
she told him everything,

37:23.842 --> 37:27.879
including...

37:39.625 --> 37:41.993
Is that all?

37:42.027 --> 37:44.396
Almost.
There were these grenades

37:44.430 --> 37:46.398
that Milos was hiding
in the hotel, and, uh,

37:46.432 --> 37:47.899
my mother and I threw them
into the ocean. That's

37:47.933 --> 37:49.535
how she lost her hand.

37:49.568 --> 37:50.869
And her eye.

37:52.871 --> 37:55.707
I-I...

37:55.741 --> 37:57.543
I know.

37:57.576 --> 37:59.611
I told you it was bad.

38:01.713 --> 38:02.714
Do you hate me?

38:03.749 --> 38:05.884
No.

38:08.787 --> 38:09.988
Wow.

38:10.021 --> 38:12.958
I did not see that coming.

38:13.992 --> 38:16.795
If anything,
I think

38:16.828 --> 38:18.096
I finally understand you

38:18.129 --> 38:20.599
and everything
that's been going on.

38:23.769 --> 38:27.973
So let's get your mother out
of your life, huh?

38:28.006 --> 38:29.908
WESLEY:
 Really?

38:29.941 --> 38:32.478
The least you could do is admit
you got me kicked out of school.

38:32.511 --> 38:34.646
But I didn't.
I didn't even speak to the dean.

38:34.680 --> 38:35.681
Well, someone did!

38:37.649 --> 38:38.650
JANE:
You said Wesley resigned.

38:38.684 --> 38:40.652
I misspoke. He was removed

38:40.686 --> 38:42.921
for violating a fellow student's
reasonable expectation

38:42.954 --> 38:44.990
of confidentiality.

38:45.023 --> 38:46.725
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Like I said,

38:46.758 --> 38:48.660
that thing's everywhere.
Now get

38:48.694 --> 38:50.095
to work on your story.

38:50.128 --> 38:52.664
And so Jane did.

38:52.698 --> 38:55.934
JANE:
 The thunder was loud
 and echoed as she walked.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.936
But still, she was quiet,

38:57.969 --> 39:00.572
praying that she would not be
 heard.

39:07.646 --> 39:09.615
You know what's in your heart.

39:09.648 --> 39:11.583
You only have to listen to it.

39:12.918 --> 39:15.721
And just then,
 as though it was scripted,

39:15.754 --> 39:17.022
the door to the castle
 blew open

39:17.055 --> 39:19.658
and Amelia saw him.

39:19.691 --> 39:21.927
Her knight in filthy armor.

39:27.766 --> 39:30.402
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Right.

39:30.436 --> 39:33.939
There's still... that.

39:33.972 --> 39:37.776
("Wonderful Christmastime"
playing in distance)

39:37.809 --> 39:41.112
* Simply having

39:41.146 --> 39:43.114
* A wonderful Christmastime

39:43.148 --> 39:48.720
Awesome.
 Que rico. Huh?

39:48.754 --> 39:50.121
* About the town

39:50.155 --> 39:51.957
XIOMARA:
So good.
 Qué rico, huh?

39:51.990 --> 39:53.792
* To lift a glass

39:53.825 --> 39:56.528
* Ah, don't look down

39:56.562 --> 39:58.764
(speaking Spanish)

39:58.797 --> 40:02.067
* The party's on

40:02.100 --> 40:06.972
* The spirits up

40:07.005 --> 40:07.806
What's that?

40:07.839 --> 40:09.941
It's our angel.

40:09.975 --> 40:12.644
What? How?

40:12.678 --> 40:14.780
* Simply having

40:14.813 --> 40:18.784
* A wonderful Christmastime

40:18.817 --> 40:20.952
* Simply having

40:20.986 --> 40:22.954
Michael.
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And I'm not

40:22.988 --> 40:26.458
gonna lie, it felt a little
 like a Christmas miracle.

40:26.492 --> 40:29.461
Oh... my... God.

40:29.495 --> 40:30.929
As did this.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.099
My intern's script is amazing.

40:34.132 --> 40:35.967
Completely
original.

40:36.001 --> 40:37.202
It's about Thiago,

40:37.235 --> 40:38.937
a time traveler cobbler

40:38.970 --> 40:41.840
who is also a devastatingly
handsome ladies' man.

40:41.873 --> 40:42.841
Matelio.

40:42.874 --> 40:43.809
Or he
will be

40:43.842 --> 40:45.043
once I have given

40:45.076 --> 40:46.645
my first round of notes.

40:46.678 --> 40:47.679
I have
found

40:47.713 --> 40:49.147
my next passion project.

40:49.180 --> 40:50.949
(chuckling):
Yeah.

40:50.982 --> 40:54.553
* This time of year

40:54.586 --> 40:56.588
* Simply

40:56.622 --> 40:59.525
(sobs)

41:03.762 --> 41:06.131
(laughter, crying)

41:06.164 --> 41:08.233
Mommy.
(laughs)

41:08.266 --> 41:12.604
* Simply having

41:12.638 --> 41:15.240
* Simply having

41:15.273 --> 41:18.910
* A wonderful Christmastime

41:18.944 --> 41:20.846
* Simply

41:20.879 --> 41:25.651
* Having
a wonderful Christmastime. *

41:25.684 --> 41:27.619
And then there was Petra.

41:27.653 --> 41:28.954
Call the police.

41:28.987 --> 41:30.656
(knocking)

41:30.689 --> 41:32.991
Your mother needs
to be in jail.

41:34.893 --> 41:37.996
Is Petra Solano here?
Yes?

41:38.029 --> 41:40.165
You're under arrest for
the murder of Ivan Rogachevsky.

41:40.198 --> 41:44.235
What?
I'm so sorry, sweetheart.
I had to tell them what you did.

41:44.269 --> 41:46.905
What are you talking about?
What-what did you do?
You have
the right to remain silent.

41:46.938 --> 41:49.240
(lightning crashing)
Mother, what did you do?!

41:49.274 --> 41:51.242
Yeah, see that's
 the thing about miracles.

41:51.276 --> 41:53.244
There are only so many of them.

41:53.278 --> 41:55.280
Or we wouldn't call them
 miracles, would we?
