<i>Sanctuary...</i>

00:01.734 --> 00:03.120
Um, FBI's at the front gate.

00:03.163 --> 00:04.963
Will.
Yeah, Abby.

00:05.025 --> 00:06.192
Corrigan? We trained
together at Quantico?

00:06.194 --> 00:07.293
Are you okay?

00:07.295 --> 00:08.728
The restaurant
we're going to

00:08.730 --> 00:10.897
is this Italian joint
called Alfredo's.

00:10.899 --> 00:11.864
Everything's in there,

00:11.866 --> 00:12.598
cash, cards,
take what you want.

00:12.600 --> 00:13.432
Take 'em both.

00:13.434 --> 00:14.967
Hey! Hey!

00:14.969 --> 00:16.886
I'm not leaving this date
until it is officially over,

00:16.888 --> 00:20.857
and I think
it's going quite well.

00:20.859 --> 00:21.789
No, no,
don't look, okay?

00:21.791 --> 00:22.788
I just want you to breathe.

00:22.790 --> 00:24.185
I'm going to give you
the counter-toxin.

00:24.187 --> 00:27.365
Will, I told you,
I hate needles!

00:30.203 --> 00:31.305
My niece, Erika,

00:31.307 --> 00:32.375
will take you
for an evaluation.

00:32.378 --> 00:33.647
Come along, Henry.

00:33.649 --> 00:34.881
I'm from a place
called the Sanctuary.

00:34.883 --> 00:37.483
So you've already found
where you belong.

00:37.485 --> 00:38.816
Yeah, I think so.

00:39.750 --> 00:41.550
Erika, no!

00:41.552 --> 00:43.588
This is amazing.
I always thought I was alone.

00:43.590 --> 00:46.357
Now I know that's not true.

Ah, hi, um,
we should get going

00:59.575 --> 01:00.740
if we're going to make it...

01:00.742 --> 01:01.908
Ungowa.

01:01.910 --> 01:03.943
I'll take that as a compliment.

01:03.945 --> 01:05.280
Yeah.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.381
You're looking
quite dapper yourself.

01:07.383 --> 01:08.750
What, this old thing? It's--

01:08.752 --> 01:10.620
Oh...

01:10.622 --> 01:12.855
Expensive.

01:12.857 --> 01:13.957
Busted.

01:13.959 --> 01:16.026
You're very sweet.

01:19.029 --> 01:20.261
Do you have to go?

01:20.263 --> 01:22.030
Henry...

01:22.032 --> 01:23.464
They can do without you.

01:23.466 --> 01:24.965
I've been gone for over a week.

01:24.967 --> 01:25.932
Really?

01:25.934 --> 01:27.333
Wow, it feels like a day.

01:27.335 --> 01:30.836
I don't have to be
at the airport till midnight,

01:30.838 --> 01:33.404
so till then, I'm all yours.

01:33.406 --> 01:34.839
Hmm.

01:39.644 --> 01:40.878
Uh, you know what,

01:40.880 --> 01:42.847
we could skip dinner,
and cut straight to--

01:42.849 --> 01:44.715
After all the trouble you had
getting that reservation?

01:44.717 --> 01:46.518
Yeah.

01:46.520 --> 01:47.553
Besides,

01:47.555 --> 01:50.622
I want to show you off.

01:50.624 --> 01:51.657
Yeah, but it's--

01:51.659 --> 01:53.827
okay.

01:53.829 --> 01:55.996
Yeah...

02:03.871 --> 02:04.970
Hey.

02:04.972 --> 02:06.071
I'm sorry,
I got held up at work.

02:06.073 --> 02:07.272
There was a mountain
of paperwork,

02:07.274 --> 02:08.539
and then the phone
kept on ringing,

02:08.542 --> 02:09.607
and then the Deputy
Commissioner comes in and--

02:09.609 --> 02:11.476
Oh, really?

02:13.945 --> 02:14.845
Hi.

02:14.847 --> 02:15.746
Hi.

02:16.849 --> 02:17.881
You look beautiful.

02:17.883 --> 02:19.649
Thank you.

02:19.651 --> 02:20.583
So do you.

02:21.553 --> 02:22.752
You know, I would have
picked you up--

02:22.754 --> 02:24.821
Nah, you're on the way,
and I am starving.

02:24.823 --> 02:26.423
Well, that's good,

02:26.425 --> 02:27.758
because our reservation's
at 8:00, so we should go.

02:27.760 --> 02:28.892
Hey...

02:28.894 --> 02:30.594
Wow, look at you guys.

02:30.596 --> 02:32.797
Oh, uh, Abby,
you remember Henry,

02:32.799 --> 02:34.365
and this is Erika.

02:34.367 --> 02:35.099
Erika, Abby.

02:35.101 --> 02:35.900
Hi.

02:35.902 --> 02:36.734
Nice to meet you.

02:36.736 --> 02:37.769
You too.

02:37.771 --> 02:39.003
I have heard
all about you.

02:39.005 --> 02:40.004
Well, I mean, not-
not all about you.

02:40.006 --> 02:41.873
Just, um...

02:41.875 --> 02:42.907
So, um, big night
tonight?

02:42.909 --> 02:45.444
Yes, uh, Alfredo's,

02:45.446 --> 02:47.546
back room.

02:47.548 --> 02:48.881
Oh, I thought we...

02:48.883 --> 02:51.450
Yeah, uh,
sorry, dude,

02:51.452 --> 02:52.618
but we're in
the back room

02:52.620 --> 02:53.753
at Alfredo's tonight.

02:53.755 --> 02:55.388
Aw, yeah, I'm sorry, dude.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.357
I made the reservation
under Magnus' name.

02:57.359 --> 02:58.925
No, no, no, no,

02:58.927 --> 03:01.794
because <i> I-I</i> used Magnus' name
for the reservation.

03:01.796 --> 03:03.396
Tonight at 8:00?

03:03.398 --> 03:05.665
Well, is there maybe
more than one table?

03:05.667 --> 03:06.499
No,

03:06.501 --> 03:08.701
not in the Back Room.

03:08.703 --> 03:10.403
Well, in the regular
restaurant, perhaps.

03:10.405 --> 03:12.538
It's not as private.

03:14.976 --> 03:16.043
Would you just
give us...

03:16.045 --> 03:17.778
A minute here?

03:20.115 --> 03:21.281
I cannot believe

03:21.283 --> 03:22.649
you're stonewalling
me here, dude.

03:22.651 --> 03:24.685
You can take
Erika anywhere.

03:24.687 --> 03:26.053
Nowhere is as good
as Alfredo's.

03:26.055 --> 03:28.622
Come on, buddy,
you gotta give me this.

03:28.624 --> 03:30.525
I owe Abby Alfredo's.

03:30.527 --> 03:33.728
It's Erika's last night
before she goes back to London.

03:33.730 --> 03:36.397
Fine, but "near death"
trumps "last night."

03:36.399 --> 03:37.798
What near death?

03:37.800 --> 03:40.133
Hello, Abby nearly died
on our first date?

03:40.135 --> 03:41.468
Ah, that was...

03:41.470 --> 03:42.603
Nearly.

03:43.839 --> 03:45.305
Will you listen to yourself
right now?

03:45.307 --> 03:46.807
Will you listen
to <i> yourself</i> right now?

03:48.009 --> 03:49.677
So, what are you telling me?

03:49.679 --> 03:50.845
That we have a situation here?

03:50.847 --> 03:51.679
Is that what
you're telling me?

03:54.584 --> 03:55.884
Will...

03:55.886 --> 03:57.452
You're forcing my hand here.

03:57.454 --> 03:58.687
What?

04:03.994 --> 04:06.695
That...
is why I need the Back Room.

04:07.864 --> 04:09.565
If all goes as
planned tonight,

04:09.567 --> 04:11.701
Erika is not getting
on that plane.

Whoa.

04:30.044 --> 04:32.044
I thought you'd be
happy for me.

04:32.046 --> 04:33.779
I am.

04:33.781 --> 04:34.613
I-I guess--

04:34.615 --> 04:35.981
of course!
Of course I'm happy.

04:35.983 --> 04:36.982
It's just...

04:36.984 --> 04:37.816
Just...

04:37.818 --> 04:39.218
I don't know, fast?

04:39.220 --> 04:40.552
Well, yeah!

04:40.554 --> 04:41.820
She's leaving tonight.
That's kind of my point.

04:41.822 --> 04:44.189
Okay, wait, let's just
pull the bus over, all right?

04:44.191 --> 04:45.957
How long have you two
actually been...

04:45.959 --> 04:48.359
Like, like a week and a half.

04:48.361 --> 04:50.327
Yeah, a week and a half.

04:51.596 --> 04:53.096
Okay.

04:53.098 --> 04:54.231
Fast!

04:54.233 --> 04:56.266
Come on, Will.

04:56.268 --> 04:57.200
We're perfect for each other.

04:58.971 --> 05:01.404
Why, because you're both haps?

05:02.975 --> 05:03.907
Yeah, just forget it, okay?

05:03.909 --> 05:05.308
No...

05:05.310 --> 05:06.009
I thought maybe you'd
be excited for me.

05:06.011 --> 05:08.411
Um, hey, guys...

05:08.413 --> 05:09.245
Hi.

05:09.247 --> 05:10.413
Hi.

05:10.415 --> 05:11.915
We don't want to
see you two argue.

05:11.917 --> 05:13.317
We'll all share
the private room.

05:13.319 --> 05:15.887
Oh... um...

05:15.889 --> 05:17.055
Well, neither
of you

05:17.057 --> 05:19.057
is willing to
give up Alfredo's.

05:19.059 --> 05:20.558
And quite frankly,
after hearing all the hype,

05:20.560 --> 05:21.927
neither are we.

05:23.596 --> 05:25.497
What do
you say?

05:25.499 --> 05:27.332
O...

05:27.334 --> 05:30.603
...kay?

05:30.605 --> 05:32.004
Sounds great.

05:33.607 --> 05:34.507
Ah.

05:34.509 --> 05:35.541
I'm glad I caught you.

05:35.543 --> 05:36.808
Good evening, ladies.

05:36.810 --> 05:38.277
You're glad
you caught us because...

05:38.279 --> 05:41.881
I need you to transport
a lepidoptera larva.

05:41.883 --> 05:43.449
Uh, we're going
out for dinner, so--

05:43.451 --> 05:44.549
Works out perfectly, then.

05:44.551 --> 05:45.483
The four of you
can take the van.

05:45.485 --> 05:47.285
You want us
to haul a slug?

05:47.287 --> 05:49.587
Actually, it's more of
a vertebrate creature.

05:49.589 --> 05:52.056
Lepidoptera hominin.

05:52.058 --> 05:53.324
Some sort of
humanoid insect?

05:53.326 --> 05:56.160
Yes, but it's in stasis
right now.

05:56.162 --> 05:57.695
All I need you to do

05:57.697 --> 06:00.232
is pick up a small crate
and drop it off at the docks.

06:00.234 --> 06:01.300
You'll be done in half an hour.

06:02.302 --> 06:03.335
I don't suppose...

06:03.337 --> 06:04.303
Kate or Biggie...

06:04.305 --> 06:05.338
Staking out
a red list dealer

06:05.340 --> 06:06.973
across town.

06:06.975 --> 06:07.941
Ooh!

06:07.943 --> 06:09.309
How about you?

06:09.311 --> 06:12.446
I have a diprotodon
who's about to go into labor.

06:12.448 --> 06:14.248
Unless you'd
like to stay

06:14.250 --> 06:15.583
and monitor his cervix?

06:15.585 --> 06:17.084
No!

06:17.086 --> 06:19.320
Thought not.

06:23.191 --> 06:25.259
Ah.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.028
Are you sure we shouldn't
have stayed behind

06:27.030 --> 06:28.295
to help Magnus?

06:28.297 --> 06:29.763
Oh, you would not
be asking that

06:29.765 --> 06:31.165
if you'd ever been covered
in diprotodon placenta.

06:32.369 --> 06:33.534
Unpleasant, is it?

06:33.536 --> 06:34.936
It's life-altering.

06:34.938 --> 06:36.738
Well, that's
what I'm saying.

06:36.740 --> 06:39.073
Is she okay by herself?

06:39.075 --> 06:41.176
Who, Helen Magnus?

06:41.178 --> 06:43.178
There's no way
the whatever-it-is

06:43.180 --> 06:44.747
could get violent.

06:44.749 --> 06:48.118
Oh, there's every chance,
especially during childbirth.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.053
And we just left her there
to deal with it on her own?

06:50.055 --> 06:52.222
Yeah.

06:52.224 --> 06:53.256
I know you guys

06:53.258 --> 06:54.658
are a little new to the sandbox,

06:54.660 --> 06:56.626
but one thing you should know
about Helen Magnus--

06:56.628 --> 06:58.227
she can take care
of herself.

07:23.687 --> 07:25.322
She always looks
so prim and proper.

07:25.324 --> 07:27.591
Yeah, layers within layers.

07:27.593 --> 07:29.560
And that's just
since <i> you've</i> known her.

07:29.562 --> 07:32.063
We haven't even touched
the first 157 years.

07:32.065 --> 07:33.765
Hey, dude, we're here.

07:40.538 --> 07:42.272
All right,
I'll be right back.

07:57.220 --> 07:58.521
What's up?

07:58.523 --> 08:00.356
I was supposed to
pick up a small crate.

08:00.358 --> 08:02.057
This looks like
a refrigerator.

08:02.059 --> 08:04.093
Yeah, well,
it is a refrigerator.

08:04.095 --> 08:06.195
The cryo-chamber broke down,
had to make do.

08:07.297 --> 08:10.599
Okay, and the, um, the larva?

08:10.601 --> 08:13.335
Well, it grew a little,
you know,

08:13.337 --> 08:16.271
but as long as you keep
the temperatures low...

08:18.341 --> 08:19.741
Should be fine.

08:19.743 --> 08:21.409
Fine, okay.

08:21.411 --> 08:23.745
Just put it in the
back, will you?

08:23.747 --> 08:25.113
And!

08:25.115 --> 08:28.249
The lepidoptera prefers
a moist environment,

08:28.251 --> 08:29.450
a high protein diet,

08:29.452 --> 08:32.586
and enjoys the soothing sounds
of the female.

08:39.361 --> 08:40.695
I created that myself.

08:40.697 --> 08:43.398
It's yours
for the low, low price--

08:43.400 --> 08:44.533
I... I don't need that.

08:44.535 --> 08:46.401
I'm not keeping it
as a pet.

08:46.403 --> 08:48.537
Ah! B-b-b-but...

08:48.539 --> 08:49.705
All right, you drive
a hard bargain.

08:49.707 --> 08:50.773
I'll tell you
what I'll do,

08:50.775 --> 08:52.074
I will throw in
extra protein pellets.

08:52.076 --> 08:53.342
Hold on a second.

08:53.344 --> 08:58.213
I have a girl in
the van, all right,

08:58.215 --> 09:00.115
and we have reservations
at Alfredo's.

09:00.117 --> 09:01.283
Maybe you've heard of it?

09:03.719 --> 09:05.253
So, just...

09:05.255 --> 09:07.555
Help a brother out. Please?

09:27.209 --> 09:29.844
Free enterprise is dead.

09:29.846 --> 09:31.312
All right,

09:31.314 --> 09:32.880
so we drop the frigidaire
off at the docks,

09:32.882 --> 09:34.149
make a u-turn...

09:34.151 --> 09:35.517
We'll be sipping
champagne at Alfredo's

09:35.519 --> 09:37.252
10 minutes later.

09:37.254 --> 09:38.620
Oh, I should, uh, call them

09:38.622 --> 09:39.621
and let them know we're running
a few minutes late.

09:39.623 --> 09:41.890
I can smell
that agnolotti now.

09:41.892 --> 09:44.860
Stuffed with
roasted pumpkin...

09:44.862 --> 09:46.896
Sauteed in brown butter.

09:46.898 --> 09:49.565
Mm-hm, I can
smell it too.

09:53.171 --> 09:54.770
Oh...

09:54.772 --> 09:56.405
Actually,
what is that?

09:59.877 --> 10:02.510
Oh, no way. Can't be.

10:02.512 --> 10:03.578
What?
I don't smell--

10:04.581 --> 10:05.547
Abby?

10:09.150 --> 10:10.684
Abby...

10:14.221 --> 10:15.522
Here.

10:15.524 --> 10:16.556
Got her?

10:16.558 --> 10:17.791
Yeah.

10:17.793 --> 10:19.559
Put her up
on the crate.

10:19.561 --> 10:21.428
Easy, easy.

10:22.530 --> 10:23.797
I got her.

10:27.568 --> 10:29.236
Abby?

10:29.238 --> 10:30.303
What's happened
to her?

10:30.305 --> 10:31.404
The lepidoptera.

10:31.406 --> 10:32.639
That smell?

10:32.641 --> 10:34.407
It's giving off a gas.
She's just got to get some air.

10:34.409 --> 10:36.209
Come on, Ab,
breathe.

10:42.317 --> 10:44.383
What happened?

10:45.518 --> 10:46.785
Seems you're allergic

10:46.787 --> 10:47.786
to lepidoptera gas.

10:49.289 --> 10:51.223
Who knew?

10:51.225 --> 10:52.924
Dude...

10:52.926 --> 10:54.626
If it's releasing gas...

10:55.661 --> 10:57.329
that means it's molting.

10:58.865 --> 10:59.765
So?

10:59.767 --> 11:02.468
So it's not larval anymore.

11:03.804 --> 11:04.937
Is that a problem?

11:19.287 --> 11:20.620
Yeah...

11:20.622 --> 11:21.521
Yeah, that's a problem.

11:28.425 --> 11:29.625
Damn that Ernie.

11:29.627 --> 11:31.527
The lepidoptera can only
be transported

11:31.611 --> 11:34.012
during the early larval stages,
he knows that.

11:34.014 --> 11:35.280
Well, he did
say something

11:35.282 --> 11:36.948
about a faulty
cryo-chamber.

11:36.950 --> 11:38.282
Yeah, so he put
bug boy in a fridge.

11:38.284 --> 11:40.285
<i>I beg your pardon?</i>

11:40.287 --> 11:41.453
What Henry means

11:41.455 --> 11:44.423
is that we were
transporting the abnormal

11:44.425 --> 11:45.691
in an alternative...

11:45.693 --> 11:48.293
Temperature-controlled
container.

11:48.295 --> 11:49.561
<i>A refrigerator!</i>

11:49.563 --> 11:50.963
Well, yes,

11:50.965 --> 11:52.966
I believe it's also
known by that name--

11:52.968 --> 11:55.301
Because you were in a rush
to get on with your evening.

11:55.303 --> 11:56.536
Well, it was just a few
minutes from the docks.

11:56.538 --> 11:58.371
What's going to happen?

11:58.373 --> 12:01.040
You do realize that question
has now ceased to be rhetorical?

12:01.042 --> 12:02.775
Yes, I do now.

12:02.777 --> 12:04.310
<i>Well, at least the creature</i>
<i>can't have gone far.</i>

12:04.312 --> 12:07.479
After its final molt,
the wings still need to mature,

12:07.481 --> 12:08.780
<i>but you'll</i>
<i>have to capture it</i>

12:08.782 --> 12:10.315
<i>before it becomes</i>
<i>fully mobile.</i>

12:10.317 --> 12:11.582
Or else?

12:11.584 --> 12:12.617
If it becomes
strong enough to fly,

12:12.619 --> 12:14.151
there'll be no containing it.

12:14.153 --> 12:16.320
Now, are either of you boys
eager to do damage control

12:16.322 --> 12:18.890
on civilian sightings
of a flying moth man?

12:18.892 --> 12:19.724
Not so much.

12:19.726 --> 12:20.659
Uh-uh.

12:20.661 --> 12:21.827
How much time
do we have?

12:21.829 --> 12:23.362
Half an hour,
45 minutes, tops.

12:23.364 --> 12:24.930
Okay. Well, at least
the stunners in the van

12:24.932 --> 12:26.032
are fully charged.

12:26.034 --> 12:28.468
<i>No stunners.</i>

12:28.470 --> 12:29.669
The lepidoptera's
still a fledgling.

12:29.671 --> 12:31.771
You might damage
its neural development.

12:31.773 --> 12:33.106
Well, how are we
supposed to--

12:33.108 --> 12:34.641
<i>Tranqs if need be,</i>

12:34.643 --> 12:36.076
only at close range,
not near the head.

12:36.078 --> 12:39.079
Now, get going,
and keep me informed.

12:40.481 --> 12:41.748
Did she sound
angry to you?

12:41.750 --> 12:42.849
Fridge? Really?

12:42.851 --> 12:43.983
Come on...

12:43.985 --> 12:45.351
I spoke with Alfredo's

12:45.353 --> 12:46.553
and they said they may
be able to hold our table

12:46.555 --> 12:47.954
for an extra half an hour.

12:47.956 --> 12:49.489
He's going to call back
to let us know.

12:49.491 --> 12:50.923
Good.

12:50.925 --> 12:51.858
That's the first good news
I've had all night.

12:51.860 --> 12:53.125
There's more.

12:53.127 --> 12:54.860
It appears Abby's phone
captured the lepidoptera's cry

12:54.862 --> 12:55.828
when it escaped.

12:55.830 --> 12:57.096
I guess
as I was zonking out,

12:57.098 --> 13:00.533
I must've pressed "voice memo"
instead of "dial".

13:04.371 --> 13:08.041
But I was thinking
it also might work as a lure.

13:09.777 --> 13:11.078
You know, like a duck call.

13:12.414 --> 13:13.915
We'd have to hack
into the phone...

13:13.917 --> 13:15.683
Extract the m4a file...

13:15.685 --> 13:17.552
Loop it through
the van's stereo system...

13:17.554 --> 13:18.653
Yes.

13:18.655 --> 13:19.954
How big is your subwoofer?

13:19.956 --> 13:22.123
400?

13:22.125 --> 13:25.392
Darling, this is 600 watts
of thumping power.

13:27.128 --> 13:28.595
You are brilliant.

13:28.597 --> 13:29.830
You are beautiful--

13:29.832 --> 13:31.398
guys...
Ticky, ticky, ticky.

13:32.634 --> 13:33.534
I need your phone.

13:34.636 --> 13:35.602
Uh, w-wh, uh--

13:35.604 --> 13:37.003
I'm not going to hurt it.

13:37.005 --> 13:39.473
Wait, just, 'cause
all of my stuff is on here.

13:39.475 --> 13:40.641
M-my contacts,

13:40.643 --> 13:42.009
my calendar, everything--

13:42.011 --> 13:43.811
Abigail,
you're talking to the guy

13:43.813 --> 13:44.978
that hacked into the online

13:44.980 --> 13:47.548
Thunderwar
MMORPG database

13:47.550 --> 13:49.150
and re-sorted
all the player scores

13:49.152 --> 13:50.484
by astrological sign.

13:50.486 --> 13:52.153
No one even knew
I'd been to town.

13:52.155 --> 13:54.822
Oh, okay.
What does that mean?

13:54.824 --> 13:57.425
It means
just give him your phone.

13:57.427 --> 13:58.626
Give me.

14:02.765 --> 14:04.099
Thank you.

14:04.101 --> 14:06.569
This will only
take a second.

14:06.571 --> 14:10.473
I guess that leaves me
on containment duty.

14:10.475 --> 14:12.575
Well, Will, we all have
our own unique ability

14:12.577 --> 14:13.910
and special burden to bear.

14:13.912 --> 14:15.044
For me, it just happens to be

14:15.046 --> 14:17.247
the fascinating world
of technology.

14:17.249 --> 14:19.582
For you...

14:21.217 --> 14:22.884
sewers.

14:22.886 --> 14:26.154
Well, it doesn't smell
as bad as I thought it would.

14:26.156 --> 14:28.456
You really didn't
have to come with me.

14:28.458 --> 14:30.191
At least this creature's
not very dangerous, so...

14:30.193 --> 14:31.692
Are you sure?

14:31.694 --> 14:33.894
All the abnormals
I've seen at the Sanctuary

14:33.896 --> 14:35.662
are behind glass.

14:35.664 --> 14:38.799
This is like...
being on safari.

14:38.801 --> 14:40.600
Believe me,

14:40.602 --> 14:41.801
compared to what
we usually deal with,

14:41.803 --> 14:43.770
this guy is a pussycat.

14:49.044 --> 14:50.811
Take it down!

14:50.813 --> 14:52.813
Get it!

15:07.096 --> 15:09.530
I'm pretty sure we have rules
about floating and stuff.

15:10.566 --> 15:12.033
<i>Dude!</i>

15:12.035 --> 15:14.002
<i>This is so not time</i>
<i>for a pee break!</i>

15:17.207 --> 15:18.973
Will! It's coming
around this side!

15:20.776 --> 15:21.643
Magnus!

15:30.686 --> 15:32.086
Run!

15:40.829 --> 15:42.562
What the hell was that?

15:43.731 --> 15:46.299
Okay, enough
already, jeez!

15:46.301 --> 15:47.634
Now I'm just going to
be worried about you

15:47.636 --> 15:48.735
all the time.

15:48.737 --> 15:50.203
Oh, come on.

15:50.205 --> 15:52.271
Not all abnormals
are like that.

15:52.273 --> 15:54.573
Look at Henry
and Biggie...

15:54.575 --> 15:56.075
Hmm.

15:56.077 --> 15:58.244
Tell me you're not
tweeting this.

15:58.246 --> 16:00.780
I am just checking
to make sure

16:00.782 --> 16:02.748
Henry didn't erase
anything vital.

16:02.750 --> 16:05.285
Okay.
Is it all good?

16:05.287 --> 16:07.254
Yeah, it seems so.

16:07.256 --> 16:10.124
Don't worry, he's got it
all on his hard drive.

16:16.267 --> 16:17.966
Well, what is it?

16:17.968 --> 16:19.634
Well, when they
start blasting

16:19.636 --> 16:21.036
the lepidoptera call
down here,

16:21.038 --> 16:23.572
it's going to echo like mad
off these walls.

16:23.574 --> 16:25.874
Our critter
could get spooked.

16:25.876 --> 16:27.342
I just want to make sure
there's no branch lines

16:27.344 --> 16:28.710
he could get caught in.

16:28.712 --> 16:29.845
Yeah.

16:29.847 --> 16:31.013
Oh, well...

16:31.015 --> 16:32.047
Eeny meeny.

16:38.889 --> 16:40.223
Let's go this way.

16:40.225 --> 16:41.991
These are the wings marks
on the wall.

16:43.794 --> 16:47.096
So, just for
future reference,

16:47.098 --> 16:50.099
what is
a normal date like

16:50.101 --> 16:53.135
with Will Zimmerman?

16:53.137 --> 16:54.170
Well,

16:54.172 --> 16:57.706
dinner, a movie...

16:57.708 --> 17:00.643
A moonlit stroll along
the river, you know.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.678
I've seen your life
at the Sanctuary.

17:02.680 --> 17:05.214
That place keeps you hopping.

17:05.215 --> 17:06.882
So?

17:08.617 --> 17:10.986
Well, it doesn't
leave much time

17:10.988 --> 17:12.153
for a social life,

17:12.155 --> 17:13.954
in the past...

17:13.957 --> 17:15.123
I would think.

17:16.358 --> 17:18.894
Are you working me?

17:18.896 --> 17:21.163
Well, I...
I'm just thinking out loud.

17:21.165 --> 17:22.832
No, no, no, no,

17:22.834 --> 17:25.768
I know a backdoor psych attack
when I hear one.

17:25.770 --> 17:29.940
Well, I'm curious,
and that is normal.

17:31.709 --> 17:33.644
This is the time
you choose

17:33.646 --> 17:35.646
to ask about my
previous relationships.

17:35.648 --> 17:36.814
Plural?

17:39.317 --> 17:42.318
There was only two
serious ones.

17:42.320 --> 17:44.287
And?

17:48.391 --> 17:50.392
Fine.

17:52.094 --> 17:53.695
And the last
two years of our lives

17:53.697 --> 17:55.196
come down to a punchline.

17:55.198 --> 17:56.731
That wasn't a...

17:56.733 --> 17:58.032
Look, let's not do this, okay?

17:58.034 --> 17:59.067
I can't go ten rounds tonight.

17:59.069 --> 18:01.169
I just don't
have it in me.

18:02.138 --> 18:05.173
People riding you
at work?

18:05.175 --> 18:06.308
Nothing I can't handle.

18:06.310 --> 18:07.843
Don't take this
the wrong way, Will,

18:07.845 --> 18:09.679
but you invite the ridicule.

18:09.681 --> 18:10.780
Did you get
the same invitation?

18:10.782 --> 18:12.181
That's not fair.

18:12.183 --> 18:15.418
Come on, Meg, you always thought
I was a wackjob too.

18:15.420 --> 18:17.153
Look, whatever it is

18:17.155 --> 18:20.423
that finally helps you
sleep at night...

18:20.425 --> 18:22.125
I hope you find it.

18:26.297 --> 18:28.699
Bye, Will.

18:28.701 --> 18:31.002
Meg...

18:36.876 --> 18:37.909
I can't believe this place.

18:37.911 --> 18:39.878
I-I thought I was a one-off,

18:39.880 --> 18:41.980
a freak.

18:41.982 --> 18:43.415
Clara, why don't you
stay here?

18:44.483 --> 18:45.850
I mean, just
for a while,

18:45.852 --> 18:47.419
just to see
what it's like

18:47.421 --> 18:50.288
to be part of
something.

18:50.290 --> 18:52.091
Yeah, I-I don't know,

18:52.093 --> 18:56.461
being connected
to places and people,

18:56.463 --> 18:58.830
it's not really my style.

18:58.832 --> 18:59.965
Well, that's because

18:59.967 --> 19:02.767
neither was accepting
of who you are.

19:02.769 --> 19:05.803
I think that's going to change.

19:12.910 --> 19:14.878
Okay, whoa, whoa, whoa,
hold on a second.

19:14.880 --> 19:16.246
What are you
still doing here?

19:16.248 --> 19:17.280
I thought you were
going to evacuate

19:17.282 --> 19:18.448
with the other residents.

19:18.450 --> 19:20.250
Well, I didn't join up
so I could just run away

19:20.252 --> 19:22.319
when the going got tough.

19:23.788 --> 19:25.022
<i>You stay out of sight.</i>

19:52.818 --> 19:55.219
Will, I'm so sorry.

19:55.221 --> 19:56.520
She wasn't supposed to be here.

20:03.462 --> 20:04.462
I... didn't know.

20:04.464 --> 20:07.566
I'm sorry.

20:07.568 --> 20:09.534
I never should have asked.

20:09.536 --> 20:10.968
It's okay.

20:10.970 --> 20:12.203
I'm glad you did.

20:12.205 --> 20:13.571
I want you to know
these things.

20:16.074 --> 20:18.142
Thank you.

20:20.044 --> 20:23.113
Especially because
now it's your turn.

20:23.115 --> 20:25.048
What?

20:25.050 --> 20:26.349
Me? Now?

20:26.351 --> 20:28.551
Oh, oh, so I've
opened up to you,

20:28.553 --> 20:29.886
but you're just
going to shut me out?

20:29.888 --> 20:31.120
That's how it works?
Okay, fine.

20:31.122 --> 20:32.421
All right, all right.

20:32.423 --> 20:33.422
Jeez, okay.

20:33.424 --> 20:35.857
Um...

20:35.859 --> 20:38.259
Okay, well,
first there was Juan, and he--

20:38.261 --> 20:39.561
Stop.

20:39.563 --> 20:40.428
...Had
the most incredible--

20:40.430 --> 20:42.297
don't wanna hear about Juan.

20:42.299 --> 20:43.465
...Dark eyes...

20:43.467 --> 20:44.467
Not interested.

20:44.469 --> 20:45.368
Not in the...

20:45.370 --> 20:46.269
Shh....

20:52.977 --> 20:54.411
Sleeping?

20:54.413 --> 20:56.180
Yeah.

20:56.182 --> 20:58.015
Let's try to
keep it this way.

21:17.272 --> 21:18.538
Not near the head.

21:18.540 --> 21:21.308
I know.

21:35.457 --> 21:38.425
That is not my ringtone.

21:40.061 --> 21:42.262
Hello!

21:42.264 --> 21:45.465
Thank you.

21:45.467 --> 21:46.933
We just lost the table.

21:53.364 --> 21:55.565
I knew he would
screw up my phone.

21:55.567 --> 21:56.966
Are you okay?

21:56.968 --> 21:59.702
You mean aside from
just being pollinated?

21:59.704 --> 22:01.370
Sure. Here.

22:01.372 --> 22:02.338
Come on, let's go.

22:03.507 --> 22:04.373
Whoa, whoa, whoa--

22:04.375 --> 22:05.374
Maybe not so much.

22:06.543 --> 22:08.276
Yeah, I think
I twisted my ankle.

22:08.278 --> 22:09.912
Oh, no.
Okay, lean on me.

22:09.914 --> 22:10.880
Okay. Ow!

22:12.750 --> 22:13.816
Does it hurt?

22:14.851 --> 22:17.319
Sorry. I'm sorry.

22:17.321 --> 22:18.554
Come on,
let's try.

22:18.556 --> 22:19.955
Ow! Ooh, oh...

22:19.957 --> 22:21.824
And what about
the leppopotamus?

22:22.861 --> 22:24.393
The lepidoptera?

22:24.395 --> 22:25.628
That thing.

22:25.630 --> 22:27.263
Well, all the branch lines
all secure,

22:27.265 --> 22:30.032
so hopefully it can't
escape into the river.

22:31.268 --> 22:32.535
He spit on us.

22:32.537 --> 22:33.403
I know.

22:33.405 --> 22:36.539
At least, I hope this is spit.

22:36.541 --> 22:37.607
Okay.

22:37.609 --> 22:39.008
It was frightened.

22:39.010 --> 22:40.343
I think I'll need
a sleeping agent

22:40.345 --> 22:41.778
to transport it safely.

22:41.780 --> 22:42.612
You ready to walk?

22:42.614 --> 22:43.446
Okay.

22:43.448 --> 22:44.314
Come on.

22:44.316 --> 22:45.448
Okay, ow.

22:45.450 --> 22:46.282
There you go.

22:46.284 --> 22:47.150
Yeah, thanks.

22:47.152 --> 22:49.485
You're doing real good.

22:49.487 --> 22:53.589
So tell me more
about this Juan fellow.

22:53.591 --> 22:55.525
Yeah, almost there...

22:57.429 --> 22:58.328
Yeah, baby, that's it...

22:58.330 --> 22:59.328
Oh, yes!

22:59.330 --> 23:00.963
A little bit more...

23:00.965 --> 23:03.765
Oh, almost!
It's so close!

23:03.767 --> 23:06.501
Oh, my God...

23:06.503 --> 23:08.336
There!

23:08.338 --> 23:09.637
Did we get it?

23:09.639 --> 23:10.472
We got it.

23:10.474 --> 23:11.406
Is that good?

23:12.576 --> 23:14.943
All right,
we've got juice!

23:19.884 --> 23:20.983
Aw...

23:20.985 --> 23:23.919
And you looked so cute.

23:23.921 --> 23:25.721
"Handsome."

23:25.723 --> 23:26.789
Bunnies are cute.

23:26.791 --> 23:28.090
You could be my little bunny.

23:28.092 --> 23:29.559
Oh, dear God,
please tell me

23:29.561 --> 23:30.993
we're not going to be
one of those couples.

23:30.995 --> 23:32.395
There is not enough
Insulin in the world.

23:32.397 --> 23:34.563
Okay, I'll stop,

23:34.565 --> 23:36.698
for now.

23:36.700 --> 23:38.400
All right, well, with
the right amplitude,

23:38.402 --> 23:40.802
we could turn this van
into one giant loudspeaker.

23:40.804 --> 23:42.470
Did you convert the sound file?

23:42.472 --> 23:44.071
48 kilohertz.

23:44.073 --> 23:45.940
Though there will be
some degradation

23:45.942 --> 23:47.341
from the previous
compression.

23:47.343 --> 23:48.909
Yean, it's an artifact
of the crappy codec

23:48.911 --> 23:50.544
from the cell phone
manufacturer.

23:50.546 --> 23:53.781
Makes one pine for the days
of the lossless pcm.

23:53.783 --> 23:57.051
Yeah, even without
the metadata capability.

23:57.053 --> 23:58.686
And don't even
get me started

23:58.688 --> 24:00.955
on adaptive differential
pulse code modulation--

24:02.624 --> 24:03.724
You're amazing.

24:05.128 --> 24:06.527
I am.

24:06.529 --> 24:07.862
Okay, uh,

24:09.966 --> 24:12.367
um...

24:12.369 --> 24:14.069
Okay, I know this isn't
the time or the place,

24:14.071 --> 24:16.705
but, um...

24:19.043 --> 24:19.942
Here goes nothing.

24:27.886 --> 24:29.653
I hope we're not
interrupting.

24:29.655 --> 24:30.821
No.

24:34.559 --> 24:35.793
What on earth...

24:35.795 --> 24:37.761
Oh, well,

24:37.763 --> 24:39.997
thanks to my new
death metal ringtone...

24:39.999 --> 24:41.498
About that,
darling,

24:41.500 --> 24:42.666
when we're on an op,

24:42.668 --> 24:43.934
usually we put
our phones

24:43.936 --> 24:45.468
on vibrate.

24:45.470 --> 24:47.837
It <i> was</i> on vibrate.

24:47.839 --> 24:49.772
May be my bad.

24:49.774 --> 24:53.042
I had to disable that function.

24:54.579 --> 24:56.578
Well, we ran into
our moth man.

24:56.580 --> 24:58.046
He spewed.

24:58.048 --> 24:59.481
I tripped.

24:59.483 --> 25:00.982
Sprained
her ankle.

25:00.984 --> 25:03.619
Which is now swelling
and unbelievably painful.

25:03.621 --> 25:05.187
Then you've got
to stay off it.

25:05.189 --> 25:07.723
Henry, help Will
get her into the car.

25:07.725 --> 25:09.658
Okay, watch your head.

25:09.660 --> 25:11.494
Ow, ow, ow!

25:11.496 --> 25:13.596
Okay, okay, got it.

25:14.732 --> 25:16.599
Sit down.

25:16.601 --> 25:17.767
Okay, thanks.

25:17.769 --> 25:20.136
I'll wrap it.

25:20.138 --> 25:23.507
So, the bottom line is
that the critter is spooked.

25:23.509 --> 25:24.975
Now, if we go after
it with tranqs,

25:24.977 --> 25:25.910
it may injure itself
trying to escape, but--

25:25.912 --> 25:27.778
knock-out gas?

25:27.780 --> 25:28.846
Yes.

25:30.115 --> 25:31.182
Where is it?

25:31.184 --> 25:32.750
We don't have any.

25:32.752 --> 25:33.851
Huh?

25:35.020 --> 25:36.787
How do we not have any?

25:36.789 --> 25:38.855
Dude, why would I bring
knock-out gas on a date?

25:42.226 --> 25:43.493
Dude, do not answer that.

25:43.495 --> 25:44.994
Well, could you
make some?

25:44.996 --> 25:47.564
Me, no. This guy?

25:47.566 --> 25:50.833
Well, yeah,
I don't wanna brag, or--

25:53.505 --> 25:55.071
Writing a damn symphony here.

25:59.109 --> 26:00.877
Yes!
Suck it, electro!

26:00.879 --> 26:01.978
This is my town!

26:01.980 --> 26:03.179
This thing
has brakes, right?

26:03.181 --> 26:05.548
Emergency brakes are...

26:05.550 --> 26:06.550
Active! Okay...

26:08.252 --> 26:09.152
Seriously,
any time!

26:10.488 --> 26:11.321
We're good!

26:20.297 --> 26:22.130
We are
out of time here.

26:24.767 --> 26:27.034
Who's your daddy?

26:27.036 --> 26:28.969
Now, tell me,
who's your daddy?

26:28.971 --> 26:30.070
And the crowd
goes wild.

26:30.072 --> 26:31.105
Three words, please.

26:31.107 --> 26:32.506
Well done, Henry.

26:32.508 --> 26:33.340
Well done, Henry.

26:33.342 --> 26:34.174
Excellent work, Henry.

26:34.176 --> 26:35.876
Nice work, Henry.

26:35.878 --> 26:37.011
Nice work... <i>Henry?</i>

26:37.013 --> 26:38.246
Well done, Henry.

26:38.248 --> 26:39.113
Good work,
Henry.

26:39.115 --> 26:41.850
Well done, Henry.

26:45.857 --> 26:47.690
So...

26:47.692 --> 26:49.292
for my next trick...

26:49.294 --> 26:51.962
taking into consideration
the moth man's bmi...

26:53.698 --> 26:54.965
I'm thinkin' something
along the lines

26:54.967 --> 26:57.701
of dimethylchloride...

26:57.703 --> 27:02.707
With a <i> soupcon</i>
<i>of an antifreeze chaser.</i>

27:02.709 --> 27:05.077
See, this-this is the part
where he scares me.

27:06.780 --> 27:08.547
I think it'll work.

27:08.549 --> 27:11.550
Will, will you pass me
that water bottle?

27:11.552 --> 27:14.119
Henry, can you pour
a quarter cup of the mace?

27:14.121 --> 27:15.087
Yes.

27:15.089 --> 27:15.921
Mace?

27:22.963 --> 27:24.030
You sure
you don't want me to--

27:24.032 --> 27:25.631
No, you stay here.

27:25.633 --> 27:26.632
Keep working on the audio
in case this goes south.

27:26.634 --> 27:27.934
All right.

27:27.936 --> 27:30.069
The release is
on a 30-second timer.

27:30.071 --> 27:32.038
That'll give us time
to set it and get out.

27:32.040 --> 27:33.072
Okay, just...

27:33.074 --> 27:34.274
be careful.

27:34.276 --> 27:35.108
I'll be back
before you know it.

27:47.755 --> 27:49.222
You think this'll work?

27:49.224 --> 27:52.125
Sure. Don't you?

27:52.127 --> 27:54.260
Well,
I have known Henry

27:54.262 --> 27:56.029
a little bit
longer than you.

27:57.232 --> 27:58.264
No, no, no, no!

27:58.266 --> 27:59.099
<i>Henry?</i>

27:59.101 --> 27:59.933
<i>Hello?</i>

27:59.935 --> 28:00.867
You heard the plan?

28:00.869 --> 28:02.369
Weapons, catacombs, check.

28:02.371 --> 28:03.770
I'll see you in five.

28:05.673 --> 28:07.040
Dammit...

28:07.042 --> 28:08.975
Drop it.

28:10.845 --> 28:12.246
Okay, well...

28:12.248 --> 28:13.314
Enjoy your stay.

28:13.316 --> 28:14.381
I plan to.

28:15.383 --> 28:16.984
Ah!

28:18.287 --> 28:19.387
Crap.

28:20.689 --> 28:21.956
Nobody's gonna hurt you,
little fella.

28:21.958 --> 28:23.057
Nobody's gonna--

28:27.130 --> 28:28.797
Can you slow it down
and enhance the image?

28:32.034 --> 28:33.135
Hey!

28:33.137 --> 28:34.670
Yes, but take
the safety off first!

28:36.040 --> 28:37.907
So not cool!

28:41.278 --> 28:44.681
And we've lost auxiliary.

28:44.683 --> 28:46.083
That's funny,

28:46.085 --> 28:48.385
he didn't mention
any of that.

28:48.387 --> 28:50.387
It's funny, all right.

28:50.389 --> 28:53.423
You guys have been
through a lot together.

28:53.425 --> 28:55.158
That we have.

28:55.160 --> 28:57.227
In fact, the whole
Sanctuary team

28:57.229 --> 28:59.896
seems like
more of a family.

28:59.898 --> 29:01.064
If not a little
dysfunctional.

29:01.066 --> 29:03.266
Hmm, but you look out
for each other.

29:03.268 --> 29:06.268
Of course.

29:06.270 --> 29:07.970
If one of you
were to leave...

29:07.972 --> 29:09.838
Leave?

29:09.840 --> 29:10.905
Nobody's leaving.

29:12.274 --> 29:14.276
I hope you're wrong, Will.

29:16.312 --> 29:18.080
I bought an extra
plane ticket.

29:18.082 --> 29:21.116
I'm going to ask Henry
to come back to London with me.

29:30.001 --> 29:31.435
Henry.

29:31.437 --> 29:32.469
London...

29:32.471 --> 29:33.370
Tonight.

29:33.372 --> 29:34.605
Tonight?

29:34.607 --> 29:36.473
What do you think?

29:38.943 --> 29:41.112
What do I think?

29:41.114 --> 29:43.214
Uh...

29:43.216 --> 29:47.518
I-I think that you
should talk to Henry.

29:47.520 --> 29:49.520
I've been trying.

29:49.522 --> 29:51.021
I was going to do it at dinner,

29:51.023 --> 29:53.324
but, well, I haven't exactly
had the right moment.

29:53.326 --> 29:55.626
Welcome to life
in the Sanctuary.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.195
Crazy.

29:57.197 --> 29:59.097
Yeah, it is.

29:59.099 --> 29:59.998
Yet you love it.

30:02.435 --> 30:04.070
I do.

30:04.072 --> 30:05.505
Now.

30:05.507 --> 30:07.607
In the beginning, not so much,

30:07.609 --> 30:11.411
but after everything
I know now,

30:11.413 --> 30:13.247
how can I go back
to my old life?

30:13.249 --> 30:16.584
That's exactly how I feel.

30:16.586 --> 30:19.120
Meeting Henry
opened up my world.

30:19.122 --> 30:21.655
He changed my life,

30:21.657 --> 30:25.592
and now I want him
to be part of it.

30:31.565 --> 30:33.532
We should keep going.

30:36.669 --> 30:40.472
Oh, thanks, that was
getting a little itchy.

30:40.474 --> 30:43.507
Yeah, you know, I'm no doctor,
but it looks okay.

30:43.509 --> 30:44.608
I think the bandage

30:44.610 --> 30:46.577
is keeping
the swelling down.

30:46.579 --> 30:48.512
Thanks, Henry.

30:48.514 --> 30:50.247
My pleasure.

30:50.249 --> 30:52.115
It's my old
boy scout training.

30:52.117 --> 30:53.983
You were a boy scout?

30:53.985 --> 30:55.318
Yeah, no.

30:55.320 --> 30:57.053
They wouldn't, um...

30:57.055 --> 30:58.387
I don't know
why I said that, actually.

30:58.389 --> 31:00.256
Well, I guess it's
'cause it sounds like

31:00.258 --> 31:01.924
a thing people say.

31:01.926 --> 31:02.925
Yeah.

31:02.927 --> 31:05.027
Other people.

31:07.164 --> 31:08.698
I don't think of you
any differently

31:08.700 --> 31:10.033
than anybody else.

31:11.969 --> 31:13.469
That's cool.

31:13.471 --> 31:15.237
Do you?

31:16.573 --> 31:18.173
Yeah.

31:18.175 --> 31:21.243
Yeah, I mean, you know,
I am different, so...

31:21.245 --> 31:23.378
There was a time not so long ago

31:23.380 --> 31:25.180
where I thought
that was a bad thing.

31:25.182 --> 31:27.115
What changed your mind?

31:28.484 --> 31:30.285
This is no disease, Henry.

31:32.322 --> 31:33.487
All I know is
I can't control it.

31:33.489 --> 31:34.555
Not as yet, no, but--

31:34.557 --> 31:36.289
Look, doc,

31:36.291 --> 31:38.725
I have spent my adult life
working with abnormals,

31:38.727 --> 31:42.062
learning to accept them,
even appreciate them...

31:45.533 --> 31:47.768
Look, I can't account
for myself when I'm that thing,

31:47.770 --> 31:50.603
and what if I hurt one of you?

31:50.605 --> 31:52.605
I can't
let that happen.

31:54.242 --> 31:56.275
I spent a lifetime
more or less human.

31:56.277 --> 31:58.010
You've yet
to discover your gift.

31:58.012 --> 31:59.746
You only see the curse in it.

32:03.284 --> 32:04.718
The difference between
you and me

32:04.720 --> 32:06.620
is you can control your power.

32:06.622 --> 32:09.157
And in time, so will you.

32:14.530 --> 32:15.797
I got to admit,

32:15.799 --> 32:18.066
at first it was a little scary
for me too.

32:18.068 --> 32:19.067
But once you get
the hang of it,

32:19.069 --> 32:21.303
it's pretty awesome.

32:23.673 --> 32:25.273
Awesome.

32:25.275 --> 32:26.541
It's not
a thing, Erika,

32:26.543 --> 32:27.808
it's who we are.

32:27.810 --> 32:29.643
Not if we want to be safe.

32:37.285 --> 32:38.719
How did you do that?

32:38.721 --> 32:40.154
See?

32:40.156 --> 32:41.422
You don't have to be afraid.

32:41.424 --> 32:43.391
I'm totally in control.

32:43.393 --> 32:46.428
You know,
I've never seen...

32:46.430 --> 32:47.730
The hapster?

32:49.466 --> 32:52.202
I-I know it's like
asking Elton John

32:52.204 --> 32:55.305
to sing at a party, but...

32:57.542 --> 33:00.310
Oh... um,
yeah, you know,

33:00.312 --> 33:02.512
just, it's a little
bit complicated,

33:02.514 --> 33:03.747
'cause, uh, there's
this whole part

33:03.749 --> 33:04.848
where I go naked.

33:04.850 --> 33:06.549
Never mind.

33:10.088 --> 33:11.488
Hey, uh,

33:11.490 --> 33:13.524
you feel up to helping
me out a little bit?

33:13.526 --> 33:14.592
At your service.

33:14.594 --> 33:15.659
All right,

33:15.661 --> 33:17.594
I've almost got
the audio hookup ready.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.563
Can you hold a soldering iron?

33:19.565 --> 33:20.730
Absolutely.

33:20.732 --> 33:22.299
Uh...

33:22.301 --> 33:24.868
Uh, uh...

33:24.870 --> 33:26.904
What is that?

33:40.852 --> 33:42.420
It's shedding the last
of its old skin.

33:42.422 --> 33:43.821
So we're running out of time.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.459
We'll set up here.
Air current's flowing north.

33:48.461 --> 33:50.661
It'll carry the gas
down through both tunnels.

33:50.663 --> 33:54.665
And then we'll move in,
scoop up sleeping beauty...

33:54.667 --> 33:57.368
And get on with our evening,
such as it is.

33:58.771 --> 34:00.304
At this point, I think
we're talkin' drive-thru.

34:00.306 --> 34:02.673
Okay, almost there.
Just one last patch.

34:02.675 --> 34:03.841
Can you pass me that USB?

34:03.843 --> 34:06.510
Yeah.

34:06.512 --> 34:07.345
Thank you.

34:08.847 --> 34:10.181
All right.

34:10.183 --> 34:12.248
We are ready to rock and roll.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.487
We'll have 30 seconds
to vacate the area.

34:16.489 --> 34:17.721
Ready to run?

34:17.723 --> 34:20.491
On your mark.

34:21.860 --> 34:22.893
Ow! Oh,
that's working.

34:24.896 --> 34:26.696
Henry...

34:26.697 --> 34:27.764
He got it working.

34:27.766 --> 34:29.565
Too right.

34:34.672 --> 34:35.505
The gas!

34:35.507 --> 34:36.873
No time, come on!

34:39.877 --> 34:41.812
Okay, let's go.

34:45.818 --> 34:47.751
Whoa, this is not cool!

34:49.420 --> 34:50.420
Oh, my God.

34:59.527 --> 35:01.361
You guys okay in there?

35:04.598 --> 35:07.499
Um... yeah, we've
been better.

35:07.501 --> 35:09.235
Why is it doing this?

35:09.237 --> 35:10.803
I don't know.

35:10.805 --> 35:12.271
Hey, maybe it doesn't like
the sound of its own voice.

35:14.608 --> 35:15.641
Th-that's it.

35:15.643 --> 35:17.275
Turn the speakers off!

35:17.277 --> 35:18.210
Go, go, go, go.

35:30.323 --> 35:31.891
Uh, how did you...

35:31.893 --> 35:34.561
<i>It thought the sound</i>
<i>was another dude.</i>

35:34.563 --> 35:36.730
So it saw you as a threat.

35:36.732 --> 35:38.765
Where is it now?

35:40.536 --> 35:41.836
It's just on top
of the van,

35:41.838 --> 35:44.573
<i>hanging out.</i>

35:44.575 --> 35:47.342
Well, can you catch it?

35:47.344 --> 35:48.810
Not without
setting it off again.

35:48.812 --> 35:51.512
I think this calls for
a woman's touch.

35:54.517 --> 35:55.717
I don't...

35:59.956 --> 36:01.923
Ernie.
It's Zimmerman.

36:01.925 --> 36:03.792
<i>Uh, who?</i>

36:03.794 --> 36:05.460
From the Sanctuary.

36:05.462 --> 36:07.429
Uh-huh, so now
you want my help?

36:07.431 --> 36:08.831
Hey, this giant gnat

36:08.833 --> 36:10.265
wasn't supposed to hatch
for another month.

36:10.267 --> 36:11.900
Are you questioning
my business practices?

36:11.902 --> 36:15.637
No, no, let's just
move on, okay?

36:15.639 --> 36:16.871
<i>I take it you've</i>
<i>reconsidered</i>

36:16.873 --> 36:20.842
<i>my previous offer</i>
<i>of a package deal.</i>

36:20.844 --> 36:23.378
Just give me the female sound
that calms it down.

36:23.380 --> 36:24.746
<i>Fine.</i>

36:24.748 --> 36:26.314
<i>As I mentioned,</i>
<i>i designed it myself.</i>

36:26.316 --> 36:28.549
There are certain
proprietary rights...

36:28.551 --> 36:30.851
Yes, we will pay.

36:30.853 --> 36:32.786
Just send the file.

36:32.788 --> 36:34.021
Look, buddy,
you gotta be more specific.

36:34.023 --> 36:35.022
What kind of file?

36:35.024 --> 36:36.256
Wav, mp3--

36:36.258 --> 36:38.724
whatever's fastest!
Just send it!

36:38.726 --> 36:40.693
All right, I'm going to pull
the phone away from my face.

36:40.695 --> 36:41.760
Please hold.

36:43.463 --> 36:44.730
This guy...

36:45.899 --> 36:48.802
What's going on?

36:48.804 --> 36:51.371
I don't know.

36:53.007 --> 36:54.942
Sending now,

36:54.944 --> 36:56.477
but it's a lot of information.

36:56.479 --> 36:58.946
Come on,
come on...

36:58.948 --> 37:00.315
<i>It may take a few seconds.</i>

37:00.317 --> 37:02.350
Hey, uh, while we're waiting,

37:02.352 --> 37:04.519
perhaps I could interest you
in a refurbished cryo-chamber?

37:05.822 --> 37:07.789
Got it!

37:07.791 --> 37:09.324
<i>You're welcome.</i>

37:23.370 --> 37:24.704
What's going on now?

37:24.706 --> 37:26.540
Yeah, still don't know.

37:26.542 --> 37:28.809
In the same van
as you, so...

37:28.811 --> 37:30.878
I hope it's good.

37:35.518 --> 37:37.954
I think it likes you.

37:39.690 --> 37:43.693
Not exactly the kind of action
I was hoping for tonight.

38:05.413 --> 38:07.448
I'm sorry the night
got away from us.

38:07.450 --> 38:08.916
Yeah.

38:08.918 --> 38:10.651
I had such
big plans for us.

38:10.653 --> 38:13.988
Well, now that we finally
have a moment to ourselves...

38:16.726 --> 38:18.694
- I want you to stay.
- I want you to come with me.

38:27.504 --> 38:29.038
Um, this is
a first class ticket

38:29.040 --> 38:31.141
to London
with my name on it.

38:34.579 --> 38:37.682
It's beautiful.

38:40.387 --> 38:43.588
I don't want you to leave.
You could stay.

38:45.491 --> 38:48.460
Henry, I can't stay here.

38:48.462 --> 38:50.962
I grew up in an institution
for abnormals.

38:50.964 --> 38:52.731
No, the Sanctuary 's
more than that.

38:52.733 --> 38:53.965
It's a family.

38:53.967 --> 38:55.200
Maybe for you,

38:55.202 --> 38:59.938
but you've lived your life,
seen the world.

38:59.940 --> 39:01.105
Now it's my turn.

39:04.176 --> 39:05.076
Whoo.

39:05.078 --> 39:06.978
Boy, this is, uh...

39:06.980 --> 39:08.846
really not going
how I imagined.

39:08.848 --> 39:10.481
You could come with me.

39:10.483 --> 39:11.682
I can't.

39:11.684 --> 39:14.718
I'm needed here.

39:49.487 --> 39:52.055
I'll visit.

39:52.057 --> 39:55.592
Be safe.

40:19.515 --> 40:21.683
I'm sure Kate won't mind
you borrowing these.

40:21.685 --> 40:23.485
Oh, no,
no, I shouldn't.

40:23.487 --> 40:24.486
Are you kidding?

40:24.488 --> 40:25.554
She's got, like,
47 pairs in there.

40:25.556 --> 40:27.122
Oh, well, in that case,

40:27.124 --> 40:28.924
maybe I'll keep them
for next time.

40:30.161 --> 40:31.828
You are a glutton
for punishment.

40:31.830 --> 40:35.265
Well, as long as it's fun,

40:35.267 --> 40:37.234
I'll keep coming back.

40:37.236 --> 40:39.170
Really?

40:39.172 --> 40:42.040
What happens the next time
we get covered in sewage

40:42.042 --> 40:44.876
and moth man spew?

40:46.778 --> 40:47.812
Well...

40:51.684 --> 40:55.253
Hmm. Nice.

40:55.255 --> 40:57.988
That's just an excuse

40:57.990 --> 41:01.926
to get these
dirty clothes off.

41:01.928 --> 41:04.295
Y...eah.

41:04.297 --> 41:06.631
I guess you're right.

41:29.256 --> 41:30.889
Erika's gone?

41:32.193 --> 41:33.192
Yup.

41:33.194 --> 41:35.194
The driver
just left.

41:35.196 --> 41:36.495
So, how are you doing?

41:36.497 --> 41:38.898
You know, I'm doing
pretty good, actually.

41:40.200 --> 41:41.367
I know it's weird,

41:41.369 --> 41:43.136
but apparently
there's more to a relationship

41:43.138 --> 41:44.972
than just being a hap.

41:46.307 --> 41:48.776
I've got something
I need your help with.

41:50.412 --> 41:51.646
Doc, I'm pretty beat.

41:51.648 --> 41:54.316
Too bad. It can't wait.

42:04.828 --> 42:08.631
There's nothing worse
than cold agnolotti.

42:14.972 --> 42:16.972
Since when does
Alfredo's deliver?

42:16.974 --> 42:19.108
They don't.

42:19.110 --> 42:21.677
I have said it before,
and I will say it again.

42:21.679 --> 42:22.678
You rock.

42:22.680 --> 42:23.745
I'll drink to that.

42:25.748 --> 42:27.715
Oh...

42:30.418 --> 42:32.219
Will you be joining us
for dinner?

42:32.221 --> 42:33.387
Uh, no.

42:33.389 --> 42:34.888
We just came
for some profiteroles.

42:35.957 --> 42:37.123
Ah.

42:37.125 --> 42:39.392
Oh...

42:39.394 --> 42:41.227
The agnolotti.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.265
And the, uh, agnolotti.

42:47.768 --> 42:48.968
No...

42:48.970 --> 42:50.669
Ciao.

42:53.040 --> 42:54.306
