You're dead.
There's nothing.

00:04.005 --> 00:05.798
Just your body getting eaten
by worms and slugs.

right before I die,

00:11.637 --> 00:13.514
I'm gonna just join
all the religions, right?

00:13.639 --> 00:15.391
So if, like,
God is actually, like,

00:15.516 --> 00:17.101
Buddha or, like, Jesus,

00:17.226 --> 00:18.728

I'm on that."

I'm just tossed up

00:24.483 --> 00:25.610

part of me is like,

00:25.735 --> 00:26.986
dude, I wanna party
with Satan,

00:27.111 --> 00:28.487
'cause he, like,
seems pretty cool,

- No.

00:32.992 --> 00:34.535

horns on his head,

00:34.660 --> 00:36.746
and the other dude
is just like Morgan Freeman...

00:36.871 --> 00:38.331

- Is God.

00:38.456 --> 00:39.707

with Morgan Freeman.

he's not Satan?

how long

00:48.299 --> 00:49.592

00:52.928 --> 00:55.097

They weren't.

Excuse me, sir.

01:07.026 --> 01:08.653

01:08.778 --> 01:11.030

employee appreciation day.

01:15.034 --> 01:17.870
It's like Pixar or something,
or like Panera Bread.

01:17.995 --> 01:19.330
At the end of the night,
instead of throwing away

01:19.455 --> 01:21.040
all the bread, they give
the employees the bread.

01:21.165 --> 01:22.792
They're like,
"Hey, you did a great job

01:22.917 --> 01:24.960

Sharon, take home a sourdough."

01:25.086 --> 01:27.588
And they split up the breads.
- Oh, sourdough.

01:27.713 --> 01:29.423
- We love hot bread.
We love a good hot bread.

01:29.548 --> 01:31.509
- That sounds good, but we make
dog food for the military.

01:31.634 --> 01:33.302

if you'd let me ride

01:33.427 --> 01:34.553

an Air Bud sequel.

It's not a real gun.
It was a hand.

07:58.062 --> 07:59.229

everything else.

Just whatever the fastest pizza
you can make is.

11:40.784 --> 11:42.786
- I got raw pizza.
That's pretty fast.

11:42.911 --> 11:44.288
Takes, like,
a couple minutes.

11:44.413 --> 11:45.956
- Raw pizza?
- Yeah.

11:46.081 --> 11:47.249
It's actually pretty good.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.126
It's almost like
regular pizza,

11:49.251 --> 11:51.586
but it's, like,
more rawer.

11:51.712 --> 11:54.089
- Uh, well, um,

11:54.214 --> 11:56.300

something else out.
