00:03.511 --> 00:06.111
Aw, man, did you see
this post from Raj?

00:06.113 --> 00:08.580
What? Is it another
video of him and his dog

00:08.582 --> 00:11.917
Lady-and-the-Tramping
some spaghetti?

00:11.919 --> 00:14.186
No. He can't afford
his apartment,

00:14.188 --> 00:17.122
and he's asking if anyone knows
of a cheap place to live.

00:17.124 --> 00:20.559
I want to say "India,"
but it seems mean.

00:23.230 --> 00:24.730
What's so funny?

00:24.732 --> 00:27.166
Raj is looking for
a cheap place to live,

00:27.168 --> 00:29.668
and I wrote "India."

00:29.670 --> 00:33.372
Don't post that;
be supportive.

00:33.374 --> 00:36.842
Maybe you should be supportive
of my hilarious jokes.

00:38.412 --> 00:40.646
Fine, what should we do?

00:40.648 --> 00:43.015
We're smart. I'm sure we
can think of something.

00:43.017 --> 00:44.550
You want to let him
live here?

00:44.552 --> 00:46.652
Oh, we're smarter
than that.

00:47.621 --> 00:49.922
I know our
apartment's small,

00:49.924 --> 00:51.890
but I think we
can make room.

00:51.892 --> 00:53.325
No, Sheldon.

00:53.327 --> 00:56.195
We are not getting
a life-size Spider-Man statue.

00:58.232 --> 01:00.866
We do have Sheldon's old room.

01:00.868 --> 01:02.334
If he really needs
a place to stay,

01:02.336 --> 01:03.936
I guess we should
offer it to him.

01:03.938 --> 01:05.236
You're a good friend.

01:05.239 --> 01:08.140
Am I still a good friend
if I wait and hope

01:08.142 --> 01:10.809
that Howard offers him
a place to live first?

01:10.811 --> 01:13.011
You're an even
better husband.

01:14.448 --> 01:16.715
I know if the roles
were reversed,

01:16.717 --> 01:18.617
he would do it for me.

01:18.619 --> 01:20.118
Where would he stay?

01:20.120 --> 01:21.620
We already have Stuart.

01:21.622 --> 01:24.489
Well, we can make some space
in the garage.

01:24.491 --> 01:26.525
Maybe put a cot out there,

01:26.527 --> 01:28.827
get him a space heater,
maybe a hot plate.

01:28.829 --> 01:30.329
That sounds awful.

01:30.331 --> 01:33.232
Let's hope he thinks so, too.

01:33.234 --> 01:35.200
For the last time,

01:35.202 --> 01:39.404
no Hulk, no Batman,
no life-size statues.

01:39.406 --> 01:41.940
Wow. I'm starting to
think you didn't mean it

01:41.942 --> 01:44.610
when you said you wanted
to spruce up the place.

02:18.684 --> 02:20.217
Hello.

02:20.219 --> 02:25.489
Hey, uh, so we've been talking,
and if you need a place to stay,

02:25.491 --> 02:28.325
we'd be happy to fix up
the garage for you.

02:28.327 --> 02:30.194
That would be amazing!

02:30.196 --> 02:32.463
I was literally just looking
at my moving boxes,

02:32.465 --> 02:35.199
trying to pick one to live in.

02:35.201 --> 02:37.034
I know it's not ideal,

02:37.036 --> 02:39.136
but you'd have plenty of space
for your furniture,

02:39.138 --> 02:40.638
and there's this cool button

02:40.640 --> 02:43.841
that makes an entire wall
go up and down.

02:43.843 --> 02:46.076
I cannot thank you enough.

02:46.078 --> 02:48.078
It is our pleasure.

02:48.080 --> 02:49.914
Hey, can you hold on one sec?

02:49.916 --> 02:51.148
Hello?

02:51.150 --> 02:53.784
Hey, buddy, you still
looking for a place to live?

02:53.786 --> 02:55.719
Uh... yeah.

02:55.721 --> 02:57.721
Why do you ask?

02:57.723 --> 02:59.423
You know, we have
the extra bedroom,

02:59.425 --> 03:01.058
and if you need it, it's yours.

03:01.060 --> 03:03.594
Oh, my God, that's so generous!

03:03.596 --> 03:04.828
It's the least we can do.

03:04.830 --> 03:06.096
I-I really appreciate it.

03:06.098 --> 03:09.700
Uh, can you hold on one second?

03:09.702 --> 03:13.804
Hey, so, Howard, what's the
bathroom situation gonna be?

03:13.806 --> 03:16.740
Well, there's a sink out there--

03:16.742 --> 03:20.210
that takes care
of half your problems.

03:20.212 --> 03:22.446
But I can use
the downstairs bathroom, right?

03:22.448 --> 03:26.283
Yeah. We barely use it,
so it'll be like it's yours.

03:26.285 --> 03:27.384
Cool, cool, yeah.

03:27.386 --> 03:29.620
Yeah, hold on one second.
Wh...?

03:29.622 --> 03:32.690
Hey, what's it like
sharing a bathroom with Penny?

03:32.692 --> 03:34.425
Is there hair everywhere?

03:34.427 --> 03:37.461
Does she use your loofah?

03:37.463 --> 03:38.862
I don't have a loofah.

03:38.864 --> 03:40.397
Okay, well, if I move in,
you can't use mine.

03:40.399 --> 03:41.598
Hold on a second.

03:43.169 --> 03:47.404
Hey, Howard, uh,
how's the Wi-Fi in the garage?

03:47.406 --> 03:48.706
I don't know.

03:48.708 --> 03:50.841
Why are you asking
all these questions?

03:50.843 --> 03:53.010
Well, to be honest,
Leonard's on the other line,

03:53.012 --> 03:55.245
and he offered me
their spare bedroom.

03:55.247 --> 03:57.247
Great! Go live there.

03:57.249 --> 04:00.250
But you made the garage
sound so fun.

04:00.252 --> 04:02.353
I just didn't want you
to feel bad about it.

04:02.355 --> 04:04.121
Unless Leonard's apartment
also has a raccoon

04:04.123 --> 04:07.424
that chews its way in
on cold nights, go there!

04:07.426 --> 04:09.760
One second.

04:09.762 --> 04:12.062
Okay, I think we're close.

04:12.064 --> 04:15.366
How do you feel about
a mini-fridge in my room?

04:15.368 --> 04:17.468
Hey, pal, you want
to live here or not?

04:17.470 --> 04:19.803
Oh, uh, hi, Penny. Yes, please.

04:21.940 --> 04:23.640
Hey.
Hi.

04:23.642 --> 04:26.276
Uh, Penny, this circular
is addressed to "occupant,"

04:26.278 --> 04:27.845
but with our
apartment switch,

04:27.847 --> 04:29.613
it's unclear whether
it's yours or mine.

04:29.615 --> 04:30.748
What's it for?

04:30.750 --> 04:31.949
Roofing.

04:31.951 --> 04:34.284
Yeah, it's yours.

04:34.286 --> 04:36.420
Okay, thanks.

04:36.422 --> 04:38.455
"Just throw it out."

04:39.592 --> 04:42.493
Speaking of occupants,
I'm given to understand

04:42.495 --> 04:45.095
Raj will be moving
into my old room.

04:45.097 --> 04:46.397
Yeah, for a little while.

04:46.399 --> 04:47.831
What about his dog?

04:47.833 --> 04:49.967
She'll be in her crate;
it's not a big deal.

04:49.969 --> 04:51.368
I suppose that's
acceptable.

04:51.370 --> 04:53.170
Well, Sheldon's getting
a little better with dogs.

04:53.172 --> 04:57.174
He even took a picture
with Pluto at Disneyland.

04:57.176 --> 05:00.377
If real dogs gave me buttons,
I'd like them, too.

05:01.547 --> 05:03.414
Well, I think it's very nice

05:03.416 --> 05:05.315
that you're helping out
our friend.

05:05.317 --> 05:07.818
I think it's nice that you're
taking whatever medication

05:07.820 --> 05:09.887
Amy's clearly giving you.

05:11.657 --> 05:13.090
And what is that
supposed to mean?

05:13.092 --> 05:14.425
Well, it's like
that science thing.

05:14.427 --> 05:17.127
For every action,
you have a gigantic

05:17.129 --> 05:20.431
and annoying reaction.

05:20.433 --> 05:22.633
Just when I thought
you couldn't get any hotter.

05:22.635 --> 05:25.069
Mm-hmm.

05:25.071 --> 05:27.604
If you're implying
that I'd have some problem

05:27.606 --> 05:29.907
with him moving into my room,
you're wrong.

05:29.909 --> 05:32.609
Raj is in a difficult
financial situation,

05:32.611 --> 05:34.912
and I'm glad that he's
making changes to improve it.

05:34.914 --> 05:37.414
Do not adjust the dosage.
You nailed it.

05:40.653 --> 05:42.219
Don't listen to them.

05:42.221 --> 05:43.887
What's weird is
that Penny almost got

05:43.889 --> 05:46.990
a science fact right.

05:46.992 --> 05:49.293
I mean, it's unfair; people just
assume I'm going to be upset

05:49.295 --> 05:51.395
by Raj moving into my old room.

05:51.397 --> 05:53.263
But you are, aren't you?

05:53.265 --> 05:54.498
Oh, I'm outraged.

05:55.768 --> 05:58.035
Talk to me.
Tell me what's going on.

05:58.037 --> 06:01.672
Well, that's been my room
since before I met Leonard,

06:01.674 --> 06:02.973
and now someone else

06:02.975 --> 06:04.341
is going to be living in it.

06:04.343 --> 06:05.709
And that someone else is not me.

06:05.711 --> 06:08.078
And you know how I feel about
people who aren't me.

06:10.282 --> 06:12.983
There are a lot of memories
wrapped up in that room.

06:12.985 --> 06:14.284
For me, too.

06:14.286 --> 06:16.753
The first time you told me
you loved me was in that room.

06:16.755 --> 06:17.855
Wrong.

06:17.857 --> 06:20.624
We were standing outside
my room in the hallway.

06:20.626 --> 06:24.194
And there is the love
of which I speak.

06:24.196 --> 06:25.929
I realize it's irrational,

06:25.931 --> 06:29.233
but with Raj moving in there,
I'm feeling a bit replaced.

06:29.235 --> 06:32.202
Well, this isn't an
easy time for him.

06:32.204 --> 06:35.706
He's losing his
apartment, he's in debt,

06:35.708 --> 06:36.974
he's probably humiliated.

06:36.976 --> 06:38.942
Yes, probably.

06:38.944 --> 06:43.113
But until we know for sure,
how can I feel better?

06:44.250 --> 06:46.583
Can I get anyone
anything at all?

06:46.585 --> 06:48.051
Raj, you don't
have to serve us.

06:48.053 --> 06:50.787
It's the least I can do for
helping me carry my stuff up.

06:50.789 --> 06:52.723
It was really no problem.

06:52.725 --> 06:55.492
Not for you,
Box of Towels.

06:57.062 --> 06:58.829
Anyway, thanks again.

06:58.831 --> 06:59.963
Hey, look at that.

06:59.965 --> 07:01.598
You've got a Raj,
we've got a Stuart.

07:01.600 --> 07:03.600
Maybe we should take them
both to the park

07:03.602 --> 07:06.937
and let them
run around together.

07:06.939 --> 07:09.940
I don't know.
Yours looks like he has worms.

07:11.677 --> 07:12.910
You ready to go?

07:12.912 --> 07:14.144
All set.

07:14.146 --> 07:15.145
What's that?

07:15.147 --> 07:18.048
A housewarming gift for Raj.

07:18.050 --> 07:20.017
Well, a bunch of fake snakes
better not

07:20.019 --> 07:23.887
spring out of it, 'cause that
was a lousy anniversary present.

07:23.889 --> 07:25.722
It's nothing like that.

07:25.724 --> 07:27.291
I just, I thought
about Raj's situation,

07:27.293 --> 07:29.793
and I had a
change of heart.

07:29.795 --> 07:31.495
You know, and
regarding your gift,

07:31.497 --> 07:34.431
you said "surprise me,"
and, boy, did I.

07:37.002 --> 07:38.135
- Hello.
- Hey. - Hi.

07:38.137 --> 07:39.636
Perfect timing.
Food's ready.

07:39.638 --> 07:41.638
Uh, wait-- before we eat,
I have a little

07:41.640 --> 07:43.807
"welcome to the building"
gift for Raj.

07:43.809 --> 07:45.242
Wait, is anything
gonna jump out...

07:45.244 --> 07:46.476
No. I already asked.

07:47.947 --> 07:50.547
Thank you, Sheldon.

07:50.549 --> 07:52.849
It's a...
blank notebook.

07:52.851 --> 07:55.419
Well, I had some of
my best ideas in that room,

07:55.421 --> 07:57.321
and I'm sure you will, too.

07:57.323 --> 07:58.889
He also never
had sex in that room.

07:58.891 --> 08:00.724
That's something else
to look forward to.

08:03.229 --> 08:04.561
This means a lot.

08:04.563 --> 08:06.863
Well, I know this is
a difficult time for you.

08:06.865 --> 08:09.499
Y-You're losing your apartment,
you're in debt,

08:09.501 --> 08:11.368
and you just--
you must be humiliated.

08:11.370 --> 08:12.169
Sheldon...

08:12.171 --> 08:13.604
Oh, good grief.

08:13.606 --> 08:15.706
She is such a stickler
for citing sources.

08:15.708 --> 08:17.574
Those were Amy's words.

08:17.576 --> 08:19.610
Sheldon...

08:19.612 --> 08:20.844
I know, I know!

08:20.846 --> 08:23.513
"Good grief" was originally said
by Charlie Brown, geez.

08:24.683 --> 08:26.650
You're right,
I am humiliated.

08:26.652 --> 08:28.118
Thanks for
pointing it out.

08:28.120 --> 08:29.720
You're such a jerk.

08:30.289 --> 08:31.622
Can you believe this guy?

08:31.624 --> 08:34.157
Yes.

08:34.159 --> 08:37.126
I-I thought that was
gonna break the other way.

08:37.129 --> 08:38.361
Come on, Sheldon.

08:38.364 --> 08:39.863
Maybe we should just
eat at our place.

08:39.865 --> 08:40.865
Fine.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.765
You took my room.

08:42.768 --> 08:44.434
You turned my friends
against me.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.535
I hope you're happy.

08:45.537 --> 08:46.970
What do I have
to be happy about?

08:46.972 --> 08:47.971
My life's a wreck.

08:47.973 --> 08:49.906
How come he can say it
and I can't?

08:49.908 --> 08:51.875
Just keep walking.

08:53.000 --> 08:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:01.404 --> 09:02.703
Hello, Sheldon.

09:02.705 --> 09:04.571
What a pleasant surprise.

09:04.573 --> 09:06.040
How are you?

09:06.042 --> 09:08.275
Honestly, I've been better.

09:08.277 --> 09:09.710
Do you have time?

09:09.712 --> 09:11.946
Leonard says you're very busy
these days.

09:11.948 --> 09:14.515
Oh, I just say that
because he prattles.

09:15.785 --> 09:17.484
What's going on?

09:17.486 --> 09:21.555
Well, our friend Raj
moved into my old room,

09:21.557 --> 09:25.159
and it's brought up a lot of
negative feelings for me.

09:25.161 --> 09:29.096
Mm. Well, what do you think the
loss of your room represents?

09:29.098 --> 09:31.332
Beverly, you know I
hold you in high esteem.

09:31.334 --> 09:34.601
Can we skip the part where you
pretend not to know the answer,

09:34.603 --> 09:37.104
and get to the part
where you tell me the answer?

09:37.106 --> 09:39.907
Very well, but, uh,
if you don't mind,

09:39.909 --> 09:41.976
I'd still like to pause
for effect.

09:43.312 --> 09:45.279
Now...

09:46.916 --> 09:50.317
You've recently moved in
with Dr. Fowler, yes?

09:50.319 --> 09:52.386
I have.

09:52.388 --> 09:55.522
Clearly, your old room
represents an escape hatch,

09:55.524 --> 09:57.591
and without it,
you're forced to confront

09:57.593 --> 09:59.827
the terrifying reality
of being trapped

09:59.829 --> 10:02.963
in a relationship
with Amy forever.

10:04.400 --> 10:05.766
I hadn't thought about that.

10:05.768 --> 10:08.402
And don't start
thinking about it now!

10:08.404 --> 10:11.372
Hello, Amy.

10:11.374 --> 10:14.341
Your defensiveness may indicate
similar insecurities

10:14.343 --> 10:16.910
about your relationship
with Sheldon.

10:16.912 --> 10:17.911
That's not true!

10:17.913 --> 10:20.748
She said defensively.

10:20.750 --> 10:23.784
This isn't about
me and Sheldon.

10:23.786 --> 10:27.054
This is about Rajesh moving in
with Leonard and Penny.

10:27.056 --> 10:29.223
Interesting.

10:29.225 --> 10:32.993
They've found a need
to take yet another roommate.

10:32.995 --> 10:36.697
Seems they're avoiding
some harsh realities themselves.

10:36.699 --> 10:38.632
I had no idea

10:38.634 --> 10:41.101
all our relationships
were such a disaster.

10:41.103 --> 10:42.736
Boy, you're good.

10:42.738 --> 10:45.105
That is the word
on the street, dear.

10:47.910 --> 10:50.744
Maybe moving in
was a bad idea.

10:50.746 --> 10:53.147
I haven't been here one day,
I'm already causing problems.

10:53.149 --> 10:55.182
You didn't do anything.
It's Sheldon.

10:55.184 --> 10:56.884
"You didn't do anything.
It's Sheldon."

10:56.886 --> 10:59.887
That'd make a nice
needlepoint pillow.

11:00.756 --> 11:02.956
So, relax.
We're happy to have you.

11:02.958 --> 11:04.358
Thank you, but how do I know

11:04.360 --> 11:05.893
you're not saying that
just to be nice?

11:05.895 --> 11:07.661
Do you actually pay
for that haircut?

11:07.663 --> 11:09.063
That'll do it.

11:10.866 --> 11:13.567
Hey, Raj,
I owe you an apology.

11:13.569 --> 11:16.470
Look, could you please
put your dog on a leash?

11:16.472 --> 11:18.472
Sheldon, she's fine.

11:18.474 --> 11:20.107
Well, then at least
hold her still

11:20.109 --> 11:21.542
so I can pretend she's stuffed.

11:22.411 --> 11:26.046
Raj, I let my emotions
get the best of me,

11:26.048 --> 11:28.248
and I unfairly
took it out on you.

11:28.250 --> 11:30.117
Thank you. I appreciate that.

11:30.119 --> 11:31.652
No, I can't take all the credit.

11:31.654 --> 11:34.288
I spoke with Leonard's mother,
and she made me feel better.

11:34.290 --> 11:38.158
I don't know who you talked to,
but that wasn't my mother.

11:39.995 --> 11:43.230
Beverly pointed out that
I'm experiencing insecurities

11:43.232 --> 11:44.898
in my relationship with Amy,

11:44.900 --> 11:47.935
in the same way that Leonard and
Penny are in their relationship.

11:47.937 --> 11:51.305
What are you talking about?
We're fine.

11:51.307 --> 11:53.674
Yes, you're fine
as long as you have a buffer

11:53.676 --> 11:56.043
living with you to distract
from your marital problems.

11:56.045 --> 11:57.678
It used to be me.

11:57.680 --> 12:00.447
Now it's Raj
and his attack Tribble.

12:01.617 --> 12:04.618
Anyway, I'm sorry
for everything.

12:04.620 --> 12:07.121
Oh, and FYI-- if you cry
while they're fighting,

12:07.123 --> 12:08.589
they'll take you to McDonald's.

12:15.831 --> 12:17.097
Hello, Leonard.

12:17.099 --> 12:19.800
Why are you saying
we have marital problems?

12:19.802 --> 12:21.568
We don't have marital problems!

12:21.570 --> 12:25.472
I see. You must be yelling at me
out of wedded bliss.

12:28.577 --> 12:31.378
Look, just because we took
our friend in does not mean

12:31.380 --> 12:33.480
that Penny and I are
afraid to be alone.

12:33.482 --> 12:36.583
Yeah, this is a
special circumstance.

12:36.585 --> 12:38.485
Sheldon mentioned
you tried to get your brother

12:38.487 --> 12:39.853
to live with you, as well.

12:39.855 --> 12:42.823
Yeah, well, a circumstance
can happen twice

12:42.825 --> 12:45.492
and still be special.

12:45.494 --> 12:46.927
Do you agree with that?

12:46.929 --> 12:49.329
Well, now that
you point it out...

12:49.331 --> 12:51.131
Are you kidding me?

12:51.133 --> 12:53.534
We do seem to keep
finding roommates.

12:53.536 --> 12:55.569
Now you're
taking her side?

12:55.571 --> 12:58.505
Dear, I would never come
between you and Leonard.

12:58.507 --> 13:02.075
That's for your parade
of roommates to do.

13:04.647 --> 13:08.382
Howard?

13:08.384 --> 13:09.750
Howard!

13:11.921 --> 13:13.854
It's me!
It's just me!

13:13.856 --> 13:16.223
What are you doing here?!

13:16.225 --> 13:18.659
Well, I texted you,
but you didn't respond.

13:18.661 --> 13:20.294
Leonard and Penny
were arguing...

13:20.296 --> 13:22.095
Not on my watch!

13:24.667 --> 13:26.500
It's fine.
It's just Raj.

13:26.502 --> 13:28.902
You can hit him with
the bat, but it's fine.

13:29.972 --> 13:32.906
And if my heart stops,
just let me go.

13:32.908 --> 13:34.308
I'm sorry, guys.

13:34.310 --> 13:37.077
Sheldon was upset,
Leonard and Penny were fighting.

13:37.079 --> 13:40.147
I just wanted to go someplace
where I wasn't causing problems.

13:40.149 --> 13:41.949
I'll say it again.

13:41.951 --> 13:44.151
India.

13:46.755 --> 13:49.556
Can I just stay in the garage?

13:49.558 --> 13:51.525
Don't do that. We'll make
up the couch for you

13:51.527 --> 13:52.926
and figure out something
in the morning.

13:52.928 --> 13:54.027
Thank you.

13:54.029 --> 13:55.462
Come on,
I'll get you some sheets.

13:55.464 --> 13:57.631
Then we'll see
if I can beat my high score

13:57.633 --> 13:59.066
on the blood pressure machine.

14:03.138 --> 14:06.406
Never should've had all
these kids so close together.

14:17.686 --> 14:19.353
You okay?

14:19.355 --> 14:21.722
I can't sleep.

14:21.724 --> 14:24.124
What's wrong?

14:24.126 --> 14:26.093
Beverly believes

14:26.095 --> 14:30.163
I unconsciously consider
my old room an escape hatch.

14:30.165 --> 14:32.432
Is that bothering you?

14:32.434 --> 14:35.702
Yes. I don't care for
unconscious thoughts.

14:35.704 --> 14:37.371
My brain and I
are best friends.

14:37.373 --> 14:39.773
It should tell
me everything.

14:39.775 --> 14:42.909
I mean, how it relates
to our relationship,

14:42.911 --> 14:46.346
not the bromance
between you and your brain.

14:46.348 --> 14:49.283
What if she's correct?

14:49.285 --> 14:51.852
Doesn't that say something
troubling about us?

14:51.854 --> 14:53.587
I don't know.

14:53.589 --> 14:55.789
I just think
you're the kind of person

14:55.791 --> 14:58.191
who likes a contingency plan.

14:58.193 --> 15:00.761
That is true.

15:00.763 --> 15:02.929
Did you know
I figured out

15:02.931 --> 15:05.198
in which order I would
eat all my friends

15:05.200 --> 15:07.567
in the event of
an apocalypse?

15:09.405 --> 15:12.506
You need to stop hanging out
with your brain so much.

15:12.508 --> 15:14.174
It's not a good influence.

15:18.247 --> 15:19.613
If you're looking
for spare change,

15:19.615 --> 15:21.381
I already cleaned it out.

15:23.485 --> 15:25.552
Well...

15:25.554 --> 15:28.055
Didn't think this is
where my life would be.

15:28.057 --> 15:30.924
Me, either. I'm in a bedroom
and you're on a couch.

15:30.926 --> 15:33.960
I'm actually winning.

15:33.962 --> 15:35.462
You know, we're both
down on our luck.

15:35.464 --> 15:37.564
Maybe you and I should try
to get a place together.

15:37.566 --> 15:39.833
Okay, listen to me.

15:43.505 --> 15:46.173
There is no reason
to leave here.

15:46.175 --> 15:48.108
This is great.
Everyone's nice.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.476
It's comfortable.

15:49.478 --> 15:53.213
If all goes according to plan,
this is my retirement home.

15:53.215 --> 15:54.815
Wouldn't you feel better
about yourself

15:54.817 --> 15:55.949
if you were more independent?

15:55.951 --> 15:58.051
Better than I feel
in their steam shower?

15:58.053 --> 16:00.220
I don't think so.

16:00.989 --> 16:04.024
Penny would be
the entree.

16:06.495 --> 16:09.763
Then Leonard's basically
a cheese course.

16:09.765 --> 16:13.367
And because I love
you, you're dessert.

16:13.369 --> 16:16.236
I want to say "aw,"

16:16.238 --> 16:18.438
but I'm gonna say "ew."

16:19.608 --> 16:21.708
No, you see,
I'm doing this

16:21.710 --> 16:24.177
so I can stop being
spoiled and, you know,

16:24.179 --> 16:26.580
grow as a person.

16:26.582 --> 16:28.115
Good for you.

16:28.117 --> 16:31.084
This sandwich has six dollars
worth of ham in it.

16:33.922 --> 16:37.491
Don't you even feel a little
bad sponging off your friends?

16:37.493 --> 16:40.060
Hey, look,
I went to art college,

16:40.062 --> 16:42.329
I tried to make it
as a graphic artist,

16:42.331 --> 16:43.897
a comic book artist,

16:43.899 --> 16:45.899
and you know what I got
for my efforts?

16:45.901 --> 16:47.601
A visible rib cage.

16:47.603 --> 16:49.903
I'm not kidding.

16:49.905 --> 16:52.305
You could see my heart beating.

16:52.307 --> 16:54.741
Well, no offense, but
I didn't go to art school.

16:54.743 --> 16:56.910
I have a PhD in
astrophysics.

16:56.912 --> 16:59.546
Oh, great, it'll be easier
for you to look up at the stars

16:59.548 --> 17:01.715
without a roof over your head.

17:04.420 --> 17:05.752
Morning.

17:05.753 --> 17:07.654
Did you know
Raj moved out last night?

17:07.656 --> 17:09.455
What? Why?

17:09.458 --> 17:12.058
"Leonard and Penny, I'm sorry
for all the trouble I've caused.

17:12.060 --> 17:13.527
"I went to stay at Howard's.

17:13.529 --> 17:15.395
"P.S., Cinnamon's with me,

17:15.396 --> 17:17.230
"but if you feel like
messing with Sheldon,

17:17.232 --> 17:19.833
tell him she's loose
in the building."

17:22.037 --> 17:23.703
I feel terrible.

17:23.704 --> 17:25.005
Should we go bring him back?

17:25.007 --> 17:26.239
Well, you're
the one worried

17:26.241 --> 17:28.508
having someone live with us
is a sign of problems.

17:28.510 --> 17:31.711
Oh, that was just because
my mother got in my head.

17:31.713 --> 17:35.015
It's like being possessed,
but instead of Satan, it's--

17:35.017 --> 17:37.451
Actually, it's the same thing.

17:38.454 --> 17:40.854
All right, so we'll
ask him to come back.

17:40.856 --> 17:42.956
Well, great.

17:42.958 --> 17:44.858
Don't you want
to get dressed first?

17:44.860 --> 17:46.460
Just one second.

17:52.201 --> 17:55.035
Help! Cinnamon's loose
in the building!

17:56.271 --> 17:58.472
Amy, quick, lock the door!

18:02.678 --> 18:05.011
We're so sorry if we made you
feel uncomfortable.

18:05.013 --> 18:06.680
We really weren't
fighting about you.

18:06.682 --> 18:09.015
I just never want to be
a burden on my friends.

18:09.017 --> 18:10.951
Me, either.
Don't want to be a burden.

18:10.953 --> 18:13.220
Hey, is that the baby?
I'll go check.

18:13.222 --> 18:14.821
You are not a burden,

18:14.823 --> 18:17.624
and we want you to come
back and stay with us.

18:17.626 --> 18:19.025
But I also upset Sheldon,

18:19.027 --> 18:21.461
and he's not gonna want
to come over if I'm there.

18:21.463 --> 18:24.064
More reasons
for you to stay.

18:25.367 --> 18:27.300
Halley's fine.

18:27.302 --> 18:30.203
You know she's at
my parents' house, right?

18:32.007 --> 18:35.008
And she's having
the time of her life.

18:35.911 --> 18:38.378
If you ever want
to change things up,

18:38.380 --> 18:40.280
you're always
welcome here.

18:40.282 --> 18:43.717
Just not in our bedroom,
you dumbass.

18:45.721 --> 18:48.355
I appreciate it, but I think

18:48.357 --> 18:51.258
staying with Leonard and Penny
makes more sense for everyone.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.126
Then it's settled.
And just so you know,

18:53.128 --> 18:54.160
it's only temporary.

18:54.162 --> 18:55.795
I'm not gonna get
too comfortable.

18:55.797 --> 18:57.030
Good.

18:57.032 --> 18:59.866
Nobody needs a mooch living
in their house forever.

18:59.868 --> 19:02.569
Hey, that's no way
to talk about your baby.

19:13.545 --> 19:16.079
You know what?
I'm proud of us.

19:16.081 --> 19:18.615
Yeah, with Penny and
Leonard taking in Raj,

19:18.617 --> 19:20.784
and Stuart living with
Howard and Bernadette,

19:20.786 --> 19:22.919
we're the only couple
of our social group

19:22.921 --> 19:24.754
who doesn't need
to fill the holes

19:24.756 --> 19:27.257
in their relationship
with a third party.

19:27.259 --> 19:28.825
Yup, we're killin' it.
