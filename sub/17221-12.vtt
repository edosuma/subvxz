00:02.336 --> 00:02.536

00:02.570 --> 00:03.471
- ONLY THREE HOURS
UNTIL THE PARTY BUS LEAVES

00:04.505 --> 00:05.473
FOR THE KINGS GAME.

00:05.506 --> 00:07.075
ARE YOU READY?

00:07.108 --> 00:08.609
- AM I READY?

00:08.642 --> 00:09.777
- WHAT?

00:09.810 --> 00:11.445
- WE ARE ALL KINGS, TEDWARD.

00:11.479 --> 00:14.282
- MAN, I'MA EAT SO MUCH
STADIUM FOOD TONIGHT.

00:14.315 --> 00:16.384
ALL I'VE HAD WAS A HEAD
OF CABBAGE FOR BREAKFAST.

00:16.417 --> 00:17.485
THAT'S IT.

00:17.518 --> 00:20.388
EXPANDS YOUR STOMACH
AND THEN CLEARS YOU OUT, OKAY?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.190
I'M PUTTING ON A SHOW TONIGHT.

00:22.223 --> 00:24.292
LOOK WHAT I GOT FOR GARY.

00:24.325 --> 00:25.293
IT'S A TOOTHBRUSH.

00:25.326 --> 00:26.260
- I SEE THAT.

00:26.294 --> 00:27.328
- FOR MY PLACE.

00:27.361 --> 00:29.063
- OH, HEY, THAT' A BIG STEP.
- YEAH.

00:29.097 --> 00:30.798
- YOU SURE YOU'RE READY TO GO
TO TOOTHBRUSH LEVEL?

00:30.831 --> 00:33.367
- WELL, I LEFT A PHONE CHARGER
AT HIS PLACE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO,

00:33.401 --> 00:34.735
AND THAT'S BEEN GOING GOOD
SO FAR, SO...

00:34.768 --> 00:35.836
- OKAY, YEAH.

00:35.869 --> 00:38.139
- ALL I COULD THINK ABOUT TODAY
WAS THE KINGS GAME,

00:38.172 --> 00:40.341
AND I HAD THIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY
WHO WOULD NOT SHUT UP.

00:40.374 --> 00:42.243
"THE TRUTH WILL COME OUT,
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

00:42.276 --> 00:43.377
"THE REAL KILLER'S STILL
ON THE STREETS.

00:43.411 --> 00:44.545
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH."

00:44.578 --> 00:46.347
DOESN'T HE KNOW
WE'RE HOSTING THE DUCKS?

00:46.380 --> 00:47.515
- SIR, WE ARE SO EXCITED.

00:47.548 --> 00:49.283
THANK YOU FOR GETTING US
THE LUXURY BOX.

00:49.317 --> 00:50.351
- YEAH, THANK YOU.
- MY PLEASURE.

00:50.384 --> 00:52.353
IT'S NOT MANY TIMES A YEAR
I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

00:52.386 --> 00:54.288
TO ROCK THIS.

00:54.322 --> 00:56.224
- WHOA.
- OH.

00:56.257 --> 00:58.492
- YOU HAVE A BOLO
FOR EVERY OCCASION.

00:58.526 --> 01:00.561
- MM-HMM.
- NO, BUT I WILL BY HANUKKAH.

01:00.594 --> 01:02.130
[whispers]
IT LIGHTS UP.

01:02.896 --> 01:04.232
- HEY, I WANTED TO SEE WHAT TIME

01:04.265 --> 01:05.333
WE SHOULD BE
AT THE GAME TONIGHT.

01:05.366 --> 01:06.734
- OOH, I RENTED A PARTY BUS,

01:06.767 --> 01:08.669
SO NO ONE HAS TO WORRY ABOUT
DRINKING AND DRIVING.

01:08.702 --> 01:10.438
IT'LL LEAVE THE COURTHOUSE
PROMPTLY AT 6:00

01:10.471 --> 01:12.406
- JUDGE HERNANDEZ,
I THINK IT'S WORTH NOTING

01:12.440 --> 01:15.143
THAT YOU AREN'T BRINGING MRS. H
TO THE GAME TONIGHT.

01:15.176 --> 01:17.411
HINT TAKEN.
- NO, JUDY, I DON'T LIKE YOU.

01:17.445 --> 01:19.380
- YOU THINK YOU DON'T LIKE ME,
BUT WE'RE SAM AND DIANE.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.382
[distant siren whooping]
- EXCUSE ME, FOLKS.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.383
WE HAVE A SITUATION.

01:22.416 --> 01:23.851
A GUNMAN HAS BARRICADED HIMSELF

01:23.884 --> 01:26.420
INSIDE THE BANK
ACROSS THE STREET.

01:26.454 --> 01:28.356
WE'RE PUTTING THIS
ENTIRE BUILDING ON LOCKDOWN.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.524
NOBODY IN OR OUT
UNTIL THIS IS OVER.

01:30.558 --> 01:32.226
- OH, NO, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

01:32.260 --> 01:33.894
- ALL RIGHT.

01:33.927 --> 01:37.665
WE START THE PRE-PARTY NOW,
OKAY?

01:37.698 --> 01:39.433
I GOT FOUR BEERS AND...

01:40.501 --> 01:41.669
A ZIMA.

01:41.702 --> 01:43.771
WHO'D LIKE TO TAKE A TRIP
BACK TO 1993?

01:43.804 --> 01:46.774
[upbeat music]

01:46.807 --> 01:54.815
*

01:57.351 --> 01:58.352
- HEY, GUYS.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.388
- GARY, YOU'RE HERE TOO?

02:00.421 --> 02:02.223
- YEAH, I WAS TESTIFYING
DOWN THE HALL

02:02.256 --> 02:04.592
ABOUT A NUTJOB
WHO THINKS HE'S JESUS CHRIST.

02:04.625 --> 02:06.694
- OH, WELL, IF HE'S ON LOCKDOWN,

02:06.727 --> 02:08.229
HE CAN TURN WATER INTO WINE.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.930
LET ME KNOW,
'CAUSE WE COULD USE IT.

02:09.963 --> 02:11.265
- CAN EVERYONE JUST MAKE
AN AGREEMENT

02:11.299 --> 02:12.166
TO STOP SAYING THE WORD
"LOCKDOWN"?

02:12.200 --> 02:13.801
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
A LITTLE TRAPPED.

02:13.834 --> 02:14.835
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:14.868 --> 02:15.803
YOU'RE HERE ALL DAY, EVERY DAY.

02:15.836 --> 02:17.571
- I KNOW, BUT I COULD LEAVE
THE OTHER DAYS.

02:17.605 --> 02:18.572
THIS IS--

02:18.606 --> 02:19.773
- OH, SO NOW THE PERSON

02:19.807 --> 02:21.509
WHO PUTS PEOPLE IN PRISON

02:21.542 --> 02:23.511
IS STARTING TO FEEL LIKE
HE'S IN A PRISON OF HIS OWN.

02:23.544 --> 02:24.678
AND SCENE.

02:24.712 --> 02:26.247
- LET'S PLAY A GAME.

02:26.280 --> 02:27.648
OOH, SECRETS.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.617
ALL RIGHT, EVERYBODY WRITE DOWN

02:29.650 --> 02:33.621
AN INTERESTING AND TRUE FACT
ABOUT THEIRSELVES

02:33.654 --> 02:34.855
THAT NO ONE ELSE KNOWS,

02:34.888 --> 02:37.391
AND THEN SOMEONE WILL
TRY TO GUESS

02:37.425 --> 02:39.393
WHICH CARD GOES TO WHICH PERSON,
YEAH?

02:39.427 --> 02:40.628
- ALL RIGHT, THIS IS DUMB.

02:40.661 --> 02:42.396
- TOM, SINCE YOU WILL
PROBABLY HAVE

02:42.430 --> 02:44.198
THE LEAST INTERESTING FACTS
ABOUT YOURSELF,

02:44.232 --> 02:45.433
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE TO GUESS.

02:45.466 --> 02:46.634
AND HERE WE GO.

02:46.667 --> 02:47.568
TOM.
- ALL RIGHT.

02:47.601 --> 02:51.305
- YOU HAVE ONE MINUTE
TO MATCH THESE UP.

02:51.339 --> 02:52.840
- READY?
AND...

02:52.873 --> 02:54.642
GO.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.676
- "I'M SO HUNGRY."

02:55.709 --> 02:58.246
- I AM.
I AM SO HUNGRY.

02:58.279 --> 02:59.247
- ALL RIGHT, NUMBER TWO.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.614
"I SKIED ON ACID."

03:00.648 --> 03:01.749
DUH.

03:01.782 --> 03:03.417
THAT IS YOU.

03:03.451 --> 03:04.752
DONE THAT.

03:04.785 --> 03:06.987
"I'VE ONLY SLEPT WITH
FOUR PEOPLE."

03:07.020 --> 03:08.689
SORRY.

03:08.722 --> 03:10.424
[laughs]
PRETTY OBVIOUS.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.426
"I PLAYED COLLEGE BASKETBALL."

03:12.460 --> 03:13.861
OOH...
- YOU ALREADY GAVE ME ONE,

03:13.894 --> 03:14.862
AND THAT'S--
- RACIST.

03:14.895 --> 03:16.364
- THANK YOU.
- 30 SECONDS.

03:16.397 --> 03:17.565
- AH, OKAY.

03:17.598 --> 03:18.699
UH, FINE.

03:18.732 --> 03:20.568
I GUESS IT'S GOT TO BE, HMM?

03:20.601 --> 03:22.303
AND SO, JUDGE, YOU ARE,

03:22.336 --> 03:24.872
"I CRY FOR 20 MINUTES
EVERY MORNING."

03:24.905 --> 03:26.674
THAT'S PROBABLY NOT RIGHT.
HA!

03:26.707 --> 03:28.709
YOUR HONOR, SORRY,
I'M SURE THAT'S--

03:28.742 --> 03:29.710
JUST HOLD IT FOR NOW.

03:29.743 --> 03:31.312
- TIME!
- OKAY.

03:31.345 --> 03:32.313
HOW'D I DO?
LET'S SEE IT.

03:32.346 --> 03:34.882
RAISE YOUR HANDS.

03:34.915 --> 03:35.883
ONE?

03:35.916 --> 03:36.950
SERIOUSLY?
ARE YOU KIDDING?

03:36.984 --> 03:39.520
YOU'RE ALL LYING.
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY SKIED ON ACID.

03:39.553 --> 03:40.721
- I DON'T SKI.

03:40.754 --> 03:41.722
- THAT WAS ME.

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
- [gasps]
- WHOA.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.592
- I DON'T CONDONE SUCH BEHAVIOR,

03:44.625 --> 03:45.826
BUT IT WAS THE '60s.

03:45.859 --> 03:48.662
MY FRIENDS AND I GOT LOST ON
THE WRONG SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN.

03:48.696 --> 03:49.997
AND WE WERE IN TROUBLE,

03:50.030 --> 03:51.665
AND THAT'S WHEN THIS GIANT
CONIFER TREE LEANED OVER

03:51.699 --> 03:52.566
AND BEGAN TO SPEAK TO US

03:52.600 --> 03:54.735
TOLD US TO FOLLOW
THE VALLEY DOWNHILL,

03:54.768 --> 03:56.604
TURN RIGHT AT
THE WEEPING BOULDER,

03:56.637 --> 03:59.507
AND THAT WOULD TAKE US TO
THE ROAD RIGHT BY OUR SKI LODGE.

03:59.540 --> 04:03.377
AND SO THAT DAY, I SAID
THAT I WOULD HELP GUIDE OTHERS

04:03.411 --> 04:05.746
THE WAY THAT CONIFER
HAD GUIDED US,

04:05.779 --> 04:07.948
AND HERE I AM.

04:07.981 --> 04:10.418
- WOW.

04:10.451 --> 04:11.619
THAT'S HEAVY, MAN.

04:14.455 --> 04:16.390
SO I PLAYED COLLEGE BASKETBALL.

04:16.424 --> 04:17.425
- IS THAT RIGHT?
- NO WAY!

04:17.458 --> 04:19.327
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.
I EVENTUALLY HAD TO CHOOSE.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.628
IT GOT IN THE WAY
OF MY PARTYING.

04:20.661 --> 04:22.363
SO, YOU KNOW, IT WAS
A SOPHIE'S CHOICE,

04:22.396 --> 04:23.464
BUT I FEEL LIKE I MADE
THE RIGHT CALL.

04:23.497 --> 04:24.598
- AND TOM,
I MAKE IT A POINT

04:24.632 --> 04:26.634
TO CRY FOR AT LEAST
20 MINUTES A DAY.

04:26.667 --> 04:28.836
- ON PURPOSE?
- YES, SAM MALONE.

04:28.869 --> 04:31.038
I SET AN ALARM, AND THEN
I CRY UNTIL IT BUZZES.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.607
AND THEN I USUALLY HIT
THE SNOOZE BUTTON.

04:33.641 --> 04:36.410
- GARY, WHICH CARD IS YOURS?

04:36.444 --> 04:38.646
- OH, I THINK JUDY HAS MY CARD.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.082
- SERIOUSLY?
- WHAT?

04:42.115 --> 04:42.983
- GARY.

04:43.016 --> 04:45.653
- YOU HAVE ONLY SLEPT WITH
FOUR PEOPLE?

04:45.686 --> 04:48.722
- YOU KNOW, I-I LOST
MY VIRGINITY IN COLLEGE.

04:48.756 --> 04:51.492
AND I GUESS I HAD A FEW
LONG-TERM RELATIONSHIPS.

04:51.525 --> 04:52.493
- A FEW?

04:52.526 --> 04:53.761
BUT YOU'VE ONLY--

04:53.794 --> 04:55.429
I'M THE FOURTH WOMAN
THAT YOU'VE SLEPT--

04:55.463 --> 04:57.465
I MEAN, I AM NUMBER FOUR, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

04:57.498 --> 04:59.500
WHY DOES THIS FREAK YOU OUT?
- BECAUSE...OKAY,

04:59.533 --> 05:01.702
'CAUSE MY NUMBER FOUR
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

05:01.735 --> 05:03.003
- OKAY, LOOK, I'M NOT A VIRGIN.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.938
- YEAH, NONE OF US ARE VIRGINS.
- ALL RIGHT?

05:04.972 --> 05:07.508
I JUST HAD A GIRLFRIEND
FOR NINE YEARS.

05:07.541 --> 05:10.344
- YOU HAD A RELATIONSHIP
FOR NINE YEARS?

05:10.378 --> 05:11.345
WITH WHOM?

05:11.379 --> 05:12.346
- UH, CECILE.

05:12.380 --> 05:13.647
- CECILE.

05:13.681 --> 05:14.648
WHO'S--WHO'S CECILE?

05:14.682 --> 05:15.583
- I DON'T KNOW, LOOK,

05:15.616 --> 05:17.418
WE BROKE UP, LIKE,
EIGHT MONTHS AGO, SO...

05:17.451 --> 05:18.419
- HOLD ON A MINUTE.

05:18.452 --> 05:19.620
WAIT, WAIT, YOU'RE TELLING ME

05:19.653 --> 05:21.722
YOU HAD A NINE-YEAR RELATIONSHIP
WITH A WOMAN NAMED CECILE

05:21.755 --> 05:22.923
THAT I NEVER KNEW ABOUT

05:22.956 --> 05:25.526
UP UNTIL TWO MONTHS BEFORE
WE STARTED SEEING EACH OTHER?

05:25.559 --> 05:27.928
- I--
- I TAKE IT BACK.

05:27.961 --> 05:28.929
THIS GAME IS FUN.

05:33.467 --> 05:33.667
.

05:33.701 --> 05:34.167
- WHO IS THIS CECILE?

05:35.168 --> 05:36.670
I MEAN--I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
HOW'D YOU GUYS MEET?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.739
- WE MET THROUGH MUTUAL FRIENDS.

05:38.772 --> 05:40.774
YOU KNOW, SHE WAS IN TOWN
FOR A SUMMIT ON WORLD PEACE.

05:40.808 --> 05:43.544
- OH, SO SHE'S ONE OF THOSE
HIPPIE PROTESTER TYPES.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.645
YOU KNOW...
UGH!

05:44.678 --> 05:46.680
- YEAH, YOUNG, HOPEFUL,
AND STINKY?

05:46.714 --> 05:47.681
[laughter]

05:47.715 --> 05:48.682
- WELL, NO, I MEAN,

05:48.716 --> 05:49.550
SHE'S A HUMAN RIGHTS ATTORNEY.

05:49.583 --> 05:51.519
AMNESTY INTERNATIONAL
WAS AWARDING HER

05:51.552 --> 05:52.420
WITH THE GOLDEN DOVE

05:52.453 --> 05:53.954
FOR HER WORK WITH
CAMBODIAN REFUGEES.

05:53.987 --> 05:55.889
- WOW, REALLY?
- YEAH.

05:55.923 --> 05:58.626
WELL, AND THEN SHE INVITED ME
TO LIVE WITH HER IN LONDON

05:58.659 --> 05:59.993
WHILE SHE TRAINED
FOR HER CHANNEL SWIM.

06:00.027 --> 06:01.562
I DON'T KNOW.
ONE THING LED TO ANOTHER.

06:01.595 --> 06:02.830
NINE YEARS JUST FLEW RIGHT BY.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.932
- SHE SOUNDS LIKE
A LOVELY WOMAN.

06:04.965 --> 06:07.401
- YEAH, YEAH.

06:07.435 --> 06:09.002
SO WHAT DID--
WHO BROKE UP WITH WHO?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.804
- IT WAS A MUTUAL BREAKUP.

06:10.838 --> 06:12.640
YOU KNOW, I WAS READY
TO START MY PRACTICE HERE,

06:12.673 --> 06:14.174
AND SHE WANTED TO
MOVE BACK HOME TO FRANCE.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.076
- WHOA, FRANCE--
SHE'S FRENCH.

06:16.109 --> 06:17.478
- YEAH.
- OH.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.079
[imitates French accent]
FUH-FUH-FUH-FUH.

06:19.112 --> 06:19.880
[laughs]

06:19.913 --> 06:22.049
THIS LADY SOUNDS PERFECT,
RIGHT?

06:22.082 --> 06:23.651
I MEAN, WHAT IS SHE,
GEORGE CLOONEY'S...

06:23.684 --> 06:25.619
both: WIFE?
[laughter]

06:25.653 --> 06:26.520
- THAT'S SO WEIRD.

06:26.554 --> 06:28.121
SHE ACTUALLY DATED GEORGE
FOR A WHILE.

06:28.155 --> 06:30.157
IT'S CRAZY I USED TO BE
SO JEALOUS ABOUT THAT, RIGHT?

06:30.190 --> 06:31.124
[laughs]

06:31.158 --> 06:32.760
- NO, THAT'S CRAZY.

06:32.793 --> 06:33.761
SO--SO IT WAS THE GEOGRAPHY?

06:33.794 --> 06:35.663
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT--
THAT'S WHAT DID YOU IN?

06:35.696 --> 06:37.698
- WELL, YOU KNOW, THAT
AND THE FACT

06:37.731 --> 06:39.199
SHE REALIZED
SHE WAS DATING GARY.

06:39.232 --> 06:40.734
[laughter]

06:40.768 --> 06:42.536
NO OFFENSE, GARY.
- YEAH.

06:42.570 --> 06:43.637
- BUT, YOU KNOW, YOU SHOULD BE

06:43.671 --> 06:44.838
DATING SOMEONE
LIKE REBECCA HERE.

06:44.872 --> 06:46.006
- [laughs]

06:46.039 --> 06:47.641
YEAH.
WHAT?

06:47.675 --> 06:48.776
- SORRY, FRIENDS.

06:48.809 --> 06:51.645
THE GUNMAN HAS STOPPED
RESPONDING TO THE NEGOTIATOR.

06:51.679 --> 06:53.647
SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE
IN LOCKDOWN A WHILE LONGER.

06:53.681 --> 06:55.949

06:59.853 --> 07:02.456
WE GOT TO GET TO THE KINGS GAME,
OKAY?

07:02.490 --> 07:04.692
IF YOU CAN JUST TAKE CARE
OF THAT FOR ME.

07:04.725 --> 07:05.959
- THAT'S A DOLLAR.

07:05.993 --> 07:08.729
VALETS GET TIPPED
MORE THAN THAT.

07:08.762 --> 07:09.863
SORRY TO BE THE BEARER
OF BAD NEWS.

07:09.897 --> 07:11.599
- OH, IS THERE ANY GOOD NEWS?

07:11.632 --> 07:13.501

07:14.535 --> 07:16.504
FUNNY, FUNNY COP.

I'M GETTING SHAKY.

07:19.773 --> 07:21.008

NO, NO, NO, THOSE ARE JUST
CANDY WRAPPERS.

07:35.923 --> 07:36.890
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

07:36.924 --> 07:38.692
- I'M LOSING MY MIND.

07:38.726 --> 07:40.127
THIS PLACE IS WORSE THAN PRISON.

07:40.160 --> 07:42.062
AT LEAST IN PRISON,
YOU GET 30 MINUTES IN THE YARD.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.698
- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO
BE HERE, RIGHT?

07:44.732 --> 07:45.833
YOU CAN LEAVE WHENEVER YOU WANT.

07:45.866 --> 07:47.735

07:52.740 --> 07:54.742
WHICH MEANS YOU HAVE A BADGE.

07:54.775 --> 07:55.743

07:56.677 --> 07:58.579
JUST GO OUT THERE
AND FLASH YOUR BADGE

07:58.612 --> 07:59.913
AND WALK RIGHT PAST THOSE COPS.

07:59.947 --> 08:00.948

08:02.750 --> 08:04.184
I'M NOT A CRIMINAL.

- I KNOW.
IT'S AWESOME, ISN'T IT?

08:26.006 --> 08:28.208
- IT IS, ACTUALLY.

08:28.241 --> 08:29.910
- THERE'S GOT BE MORE

08:29.943 --> 08:32.112
TO THAT STORY ABOUT GARY'S
BREAKUP WITH CECILE.

08:32.145 --> 08:33.714
- FOR A SUPERHERO?

08:33.747 --> 08:35.549
- THE ONLY RELATIONSHIPS
THAT END MUTUALLY

08:35.583 --> 08:38.619
ARE THE ONES WHERE BOTH PEOPLE
DIE IN THE SAME ACCIDENT, OKAY?

08:38.652 --> 08:39.687
- SO WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

08:39.720 --> 08:41.655
- I'M SAYING I THINK THAT
CECILE BROKE HIS HEART

08:41.689 --> 08:43.824
AND THAT GARY
IS STILL IN LOVE WITH HER.

08:43.857 --> 08:44.892
THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING.

08:44.925 --> 08:46.960
- LOOK, LOOK, LOOK,
I ACKNOWLEDGE THE SITUATION

08:46.994 --> 08:48.195
THAT YOU'RE IN, OKAY,

08:48.228 --> 08:50.731
AND YOUR EMOTIONAL DISTRESS
REGARDING IT.

08:50.764 --> 08:52.833
THAT SAID, I CANNOT CARE
ABOUT ANYTHING

08:52.866 --> 08:54.902
BEYOND THE SWEET HARVEST
IN THAT BREAK ROOM.

A MILLION DIFFERENT WAYS.

09:51.024 --> 09:52.626
REBECCA, YOU GOT TO SEE THIS.

09:52.660 --> 09:54.294
- SEE, THEY THINK
IT'S A PILE OF GARBAGE,

09:54.327 --> 09:55.395
BUT THEN IT MOVES,

09:55.428 --> 09:56.964
AND THEY REALIZE
IT'S A LITTLE POOCH.

09:56.997 --> 09:58.265
AND NOW THEY'RE GIVING IT
A BATH,

09:58.298 --> 09:59.700
AND AT FIRST HE'S SCARED,

09:59.733 --> 10:01.168
BUT THEN HE REALIZES
THEY'RE HERE TO HELP,

10:01.201 --> 10:03.303
AND HE'S SMILING.
DO YOU SEE THAT?

10:03.336 --> 10:05.372
- WHAT?
GARBAGE DOG GETS A BATH.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.941
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL?
- I KNOW CECILE USED TO

10:07.975 --> 10:09.643
ALWAYS BAWL AT ANIMAL RESCUES.
- HMM.

10:09.677 --> 10:11.211
- THAT AND WHEN SHE GOT
A POLITICAL PRISONER

10:11.244 --> 10:12.145
OUT OF JAIL

10:12.179 --> 10:14.147
AND HOLDING STARVING CHILDREN,
OF COURSE.

10:14.181 --> 10:15.783
- OF COURSE.
TEDWARD.

10:15.816 --> 10:17.685
- OH, DO YOU GUYS WANNA SEE
THIS VIDEO

10:17.718 --> 10:19.920
OF A BABY GIRAFFE BEING BORN?

10:19.953 --> 10:21.755
- WAS IT REALLY NECESSARY

10:21.789 --> 10:23.356
TO COME ALL THE WAY BACK
TO YOUR CHAMBERS?

10:23.390 --> 10:26.694
I AM WAY TOO WEAK TO BE BURNING
CALORIES ALL WILLY-NILLY.

10:26.727 --> 10:27.695
- SHH!
COME ON.

10:27.728 --> 10:28.862
I HAVE SOMETHING
TO SHOW YOU.

10:28.896 --> 10:29.697
- IS IT BRA FOOD?

10:29.730 --> 10:31.832
PLEASE TELL ME
THAT IT IS BRA FOOD.

10:31.865 --> 10:32.833
- THERE'S NO BRA FOOD, TEDWARD.

10:32.866 --> 10:34.868
YOU ARE LOSING IT.
- OH, DO NOT GIVE ME THAT.

10:34.902 --> 10:36.036
YOU'RE ALWAYS DROPPING STUFF
DOWN THERE.

10:36.069 --> 10:37.805
REMEMBER THAT TIME
WE WENT TO THE MOVIES,

10:37.838 --> 10:39.139
AND THEN AFTERWARDS,

10:39.172 --> 10:41.809
YOU FOUND THREE SOUR PATCH KIDS
AND TWO RAISINETS.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.077
- OKAY, JUST--
THERE'S NOTHING.

10:44.111 --> 10:45.278
OH, WELL, THERE'S A BOTTLE CAP.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.715

10:56.456 --> 10:57.958
- [sighs]

10:57.991 --> 10:59.092
- SAVOR IT.

10:59.126 --> 11:00.961
- THAT IS NOT--
THAT IS NOT AN ALTOID.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.295
- OH, MAN,
THAT'S MY CALCIUM PILL.

11:08.769 --> 11:09.669
ON THE CHOCOLATE CELL PHONE.

11:09.703 --> 11:11.471
- NO, FOOL,
IT'S NOT A CHOCOLATE PHONE.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.572
IT'S GARY'S.

11:12.605 --> 11:14.775
I SNAGGED IT AFTER YOU GUYS
WERE FINISHED LOOKING AT

11:14.808 --> 11:16.844
THAT PUPPY VIDEO
WHICH WAS SO SAD AND MOVING.

11:16.877 --> 11:18.345
- WHY DO YOU HAVE
GARY'S CELL PHONE?

11:18.378 --> 11:20.881
- BECAUSE THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT

11:20.914 --> 11:23.851
IF GARY IS IN LOVE
WITH CECILE STILL.

11:23.884 --> 11:24.952
I'M GONNA CALL HER.

11:24.985 --> 11:26.787
I'M GONNA PRETEND TO BE
DR. GARY BOYD,

11:26.820 --> 11:28.121

11:43.470 --> 11:45.272
NONE OF THEM HAVE LAST NAMES.

11:45.305 --> 11:46.106
THEY'RE ALL LOCAL NUMBERS.

11:46.139 --> 11:47.875
WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO
CALL 'EM ALL

11:47.908 --> 11:49.076
UNTIL WE FIND HER.

11:49.109 --> 11:52.479
- OKAY, HERE'S WHY YOUR PLAN
IS STUPID.

11:52.512 --> 11:55.415
NEITHER ONE OF US
SOUND LIKE GARY.

THE TIME WE HAD
A RACCOON IN THE VENTS,

13:32.012 --> 13:34.581
AND WE WERE WONDERING, HOW DID
THAT RACCOON GET IN THERE?

13:34.614 --> 13:37.384
AND IT OCCURRED TO US IT MUST
HAVE COME FROM THE OUTSIDE.

13:37.417 --> 13:39.319
- IF THIS STORY ENDS
WITH THE RACCOON

13:39.352 --> 13:41.154
LEADING YOU OUT OF THE FOREST,
I'VE HEARD IT.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.155
WHAT'S YOUR POINT?

13:42.189 --> 13:43.523
- THE POINT IS,
THE VENTS LEAD

13:43.556 --> 13:45.492
TO THE OUTSIDE OF THE BUILDING.

13:45.525 --> 13:48.395
- SO IF YOU REALLY
WANT TO LEAVE,

UNDERNEATH YOUR DESK

14:47.154 --> 14:48.455
WITH A BUNCH OF GRANOLA BARS
IN IT?

14:50.423 --> 14:53.426
- [laughs]

14:54.627 --> 14:56.663
- GARY, I FOUND YOUR PHONE
IN MY OFFICE.

14:56.696 --> 14:58.098
- HEY.

14:58.131 --> 14:59.332
- YOU WEREN'T SNOOPING
BY ANY CHANCE, WERE YOU?

14:59.366 --> 15:00.533
- NO, THAT'S WEIRD.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.369
I DON'T KNOW HOW
IT GOT IN THERE.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.337
- GUESS I'LL JUST HAVE TO TAKE
YOUR WORD FOR IT,

15:04.371 --> 15:06.273
WHATEVER THAT'S WORTH.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.374
- NO.

15:07.407 --> 15:08.708
SOMEBODY'S BEEN
IN MY EARTHQUAKE KIT,

15:08.741 --> 15:10.143
TOOK FOUR GRANOLA BARS.

15:10.177 --> 15:11.578
THIS IS NOT HAPPENING.

15:11.611 --> 15:13.313
- WHAT?

15:13.346 --> 15:14.948
TEDWARD,
WHY DO YOU HAVE CIGARETTES

15:14.982 --> 15:15.949
IN YOUR EARTHQUAKE KIT?

15:15.983 --> 15:17.517
- CURRENCY FOR THE APOCALYPSE.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.419
- HEY, MAN, ARE YOU SURE
THEY WERE IN THERE?

15:19.452 --> 15:21.221
- OH, YEAH.

15:21.254 --> 15:23.156
YEAH, I'M SURE
THEY WERE IN THERE.

15:23.190 --> 15:24.257
- WHAT'S WRONG?

15:24.291 --> 15:26.159
- SOMEONE'S BEEN
IN MY EARTHQUAKE KIT,

15:26.193 --> 15:27.194
TOOK SOME GRANOLA BARS.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.329
WHO WAS IT, HMM?

15:29.362 --> 15:30.330
WAS IT YOU?

15:30.363 --> 15:32.299
[dramatic music]

15:32.332 --> 15:33.300
WAS IT YOU?

15:33.333 --> 15:34.301
[dramatic music]

15:34.334 --> 15:35.302
WAS IT YOU, BARLOW?

15:35.335 --> 15:36.303
- DON'T BE SILLY.

15:36.336 --> 15:37.537
I DON'T EVEN LIKE PEANUT BUTTER.

15:37.570 --> 15:38.371
- HA HA!

15:38.405 --> 15:40.673
I NEVER SAID
WHAT FLAVOR THEY WERE,

15:40.707 --> 15:43.977
BUT THEY WERE, IN FACT,
PEANUT BUTTER--

15:44.011 --> 15:47.314
SOMETHING ONLY THE THIEF AND I
WOULD KNOW.

15:47.347 --> 15:50.017
- IT WAS JUST A GUESS BECAUSE
I KNOW YOU LOVE PEANUT BUTTER.

15:50.050 --> 15:51.384
- WRONG AGAIN!

15:51.418 --> 15:52.485
- OOH!
- I ONLY STARTED EATING

15:52.519 --> 15:56.223
PEANUT BUTTER AGAIN RECENTLY
AFTER A LONG COLD SPELL.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.224
[laughs]

15:57.257 --> 15:58.158
- OH, GOD, WHATEVER.

15:58.191 --> 16:00.093
I DIDN'T TAKE
YOUR STUPID GRANOLA BARS.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.062
- JUST ADMIT IT, TOM.

16:02.095 --> 16:03.363
- IT WASN'T ME.

16:03.396 --> 16:05.065
- GUYS, GUYS,
TAKE IT EASY, OKAY?

16:05.098 --> 16:07.034
- I KNOW YOU'RE LYING.

16:07.067 --> 16:08.335
IF ONLY I COULD PROVE IT.

16:08.368 --> 16:10.237
- WAIT A MINUTE.

16:10.270 --> 16:12.239
I'VE GOT AN IDEA.

16:12.272 --> 16:14.641
YEAH, WE'LL GET
THE POLYGRAPH MACHINE

16:14.674 --> 16:16.209
FROM THE PROBATION OFFICE.

16:16.243 --> 16:19.146
THEN WE'LL FIND OUT
WHO'S BEEN KEEPING SECRETS

16:19.179 --> 16:20.547
AND HIDING THEIR TRUE FEELINGS.

16:20.580 --> 16:24.051
- YES, FEELINGS ABOUT
THE STOLEN GRANOLA BARS.

16:24.084 --> 16:25.618
HMM.
- YEAH, SURE, THAT TOO.

16:31.024 --> 16:31.158
.

16:31.191 --> 16:32.092
- TOM GOES FIRST SINCE
HE'S THE PRIME SUSPECT.

16:33.360 --> 16:34.761
- OKAY, I'M JUST GONNA SAY
RIGHT NOW,

16:34.794 --> 16:36.329
I THINK GARY IS--
LOOKS PRETTY GUILTY.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.731
OKAY SO DO TOM
AND THEN GARY.

16:38.765 --> 16:39.799
- ALL RIGHT.
[clears throat]

16:39.832 --> 16:40.700
TOM, LET'S BEGIN.

16:40.733 --> 16:43.303
FIRST I NEED TO ESTABLISH
A BASELINE.

16:43.336 --> 16:45.538
IS YOUR NAME TOM BARLOW?

16:45.572 --> 16:47.507
- YES.

16:47.540 --> 16:52.079
- DO YOU OWN
A BLACK NISSAN ALTIMA?

16:52.112 --> 16:53.080
- YES--
[beep]

16:53.113 --> 16:54.714
I MEAN, NO.
I MEAN--

16:54.747 --> 16:57.417
TECHNICALLY, THEY ARE BOTH
UNDER TIPPY'S NAME,

16:57.450 --> 17:00.187
BUT WE AGREED THAT IT'S MINE
TO DRIVE DURING THE WEEK.

17:00.220 --> 17:04.524
- DID YOU TAKE THE GRANOLA BARS
FROM MY EARTHQUAKE KIT?

17:04.557 --> 17:06.693
- NO, I DID NOT.

17:06.726 --> 17:07.694
[beep]
- BIG SPIKE!

17:07.727 --> 17:09.262
TOM, YOU'RE LYING.

17:09.296 --> 17:10.263
- OKAY.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.698
TEDWARD, YES, ALL RIGHT?

17:11.731 --> 17:13.633
I BROKE IN THERE
A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO,

17:13.666 --> 17:14.501
BUT I NEEDED A SNACK,

17:14.534 --> 17:16.836
AND TIPPY DID NOT PACK
MY BANANA CHIPS.

17:16.869 --> 17:18.771
- TOM, YOU'RE OFFICIALLY
IN THE DOG HOUSE

17:18.805 --> 17:19.939
UNTIL FURTHER NOTICE.

17:19.972 --> 17:22.675
- THIS WOULD MAKE A TERRIBLE
EPISODE OF LAW & ORDER.

17:22.709 --> 17:23.843
- OKAY, BUT JUST SO YOU KNOW,

17:23.876 --> 17:25.445
WHEN I OPENED IT,

17:25.478 --> 17:27.280
THERE WAS ONLY
ONE GRANOLA BAR INSIDE.

17:27.314 --> 17:28.715
I DID NOT TOUCH THE OTHER THREE.

17:28.748 --> 17:29.549
- HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:29.582 --> 17:31.251
- OKAY, SO WHO TOOK
THE OTHERS, HUH?

17:31.284 --> 17:33.186
- WELL, I THINK WE ALL
UNDERSTAND IT'S GARY.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.287
COME ON, GARY,
YOU'RE NEXT.

17:34.321 --> 17:35.288
- WHAT?
COME ON.

17:35.322 --> 17:36.389
- NO, WAIT--NO, I--

17:36.423 --> 17:40.493
BECAUSE I WAS TOLD ABOUT
THE EARTHQUAKE KIT BY JUDY.

17:40.527 --> 17:43.330
[dramatic music]

17:43.363 --> 17:44.764
- LET'S DO THIS.

17:44.797 --> 17:46.799
"LET'S DO THIS."

17:46.833 --> 17:49.769
[dramatic music]

17:49.802 --> 17:52.105
- FIRST I NEED TO ESTABLISH
A BASELINE.

17:52.139 --> 17:53.673
- DON'T BOTHER;
I'M TOO TIRED TO FIGHT.

17:53.706 --> 17:56.176
I TOOK TWO GRANOLA BARS
OUT OF YOUR EARTHQUAKE KIT

17:56.209 --> 17:58.411
THIS MORNING BEFORE THE LOCKDOWN
EVEN STARTED.

17:58.445 --> 17:59.746
- JUDY.
- I'M SORRY.

17:59.779 --> 18:01.548
I HAD A CRAVING.

18:01.581 --> 18:02.482
AND WHILE I'M ON HERE,

18:02.515 --> 18:04.617
REBECCA, I GO INTO YOUR OFFICE
AFTER WORK

18:04.651 --> 18:05.618
AND TRY ON YOUR ROBES.

18:05.652 --> 18:06.619
AND TEDWARD,

18:06.653 --> 18:07.787
I TRIED ON YOUR PANTS ONCE.

18:07.820 --> 18:08.788
- WHY?
- [beep] TWICE.

18:08.821 --> 18:09.789
- WHAT?
- [beep] A WEEK.

18:09.822 --> 18:11.358
- HUH? DAMN!
- FOR A YEAR.

18:11.391 --> 18:12.559
- SHE'S TELLING THE TRUTH.

18:12.592 --> 18:15.628
WELL, THAT STILL LEAVES ONE
GRANOLA BAR UNACCOUNTED FOR,

18:15.662 --> 18:16.629
AND, GARY...
[laughs]

18:16.663 --> 18:19.632
YOUR BREATH DID SMELL LIKE OATS
THIS MORNING,

18:19.666 --> 18:20.500
SO, YOU KNOW, COME ON UP.

18:20.533 --> 18:23.470
- IS YOUR NAME DR. GARY BOYD?
- YES.

18:23.503 --> 18:25.805
- ARE YOU REALLY A DOCTOR?
- YES.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.240
- LIKE YOU WENT TO
MEDICAL SCHOOL?

18:27.274 --> 18:28.675
- YEAH.

18:28.708 --> 18:30.543
- LIKE YOU PASSED THE BOARDS
AND ALL THAT KIND OF STUFF?

18:30.577 --> 18:31.878
- TEDWARD, IS THIS PART
OF THE BASELINE?

18:31.911 --> 18:33.413
- HEY, I HAVE ALWAYS HAD
MY DOUBTS.

18:33.446 --> 18:34.481
LET'S GET INTO IT.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.716
DID YOU TAKE A GRANOLA BAR
FROM MY EARTHQUAKE KIT?

18:36.749 --> 18:38.585
- NO, I DID NOT.
- HE'S CLEAR.

18:38.618 --> 18:39.919
- ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH CECILE?
- WHAT?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.688
- DOES SHE HAVE THE VOICE
OF AN ANGEL?

18:41.721 --> 18:43.456
THAT'S SOMETHING I'VE BEEN
WONDERING.

18:43.490 --> 18:44.424
- OF AN ANGEL?
I DON'T KNOW.

18:44.457 --> 18:45.925
I MEAN, SHE TOURED WITH
THE BLACK EYED PEAS,

18:45.958 --> 18:47.327
BUT, LIKE, BRIEFLY.
- WHAT?

18:47.360 --> 18:48.428
HOW IS THIS JUST COMING OUT NOW?

18:48.461 --> 18:49.729
- ARE YOU IN LOVE WITH CECILE?

18:49.762 --> 18:51.664
- WAIT, IS THAT WHAT'S BEEN
BOTHERING YOU?

18:51.698 --> 18:53.800
WHAT, YOU THINK I STILL HAVE
FEELINGS FOR CECILE?

18:53.833 --> 18:55.502
- I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE,
YOU KNOW?

18:55.535 --> 18:57.537
I MEAN, YOU GUYS HAD
A PRETTY FAST BREAKUP

18:57.570 --> 18:58.805
FOR HAVING
SUCH A LONG RELATIONSHIP,

18:58.838 --> 19:00.207
AND SHE'S SO PERFECT,

19:00.240 --> 19:01.774
AND MAYBE YOU'RE HIDING
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

19:01.808 --> 19:03.876
SHE'S GOT THE VOICE OF AN ANGEL.
ARE YOU STILL IN LOVE WITH HER?

19:03.910 --> 19:05.612
- REBECCA, I COULDN'T POSSIBLY

19:05.645 --> 19:06.679
STILL BE IN LOVE WITH HER,
BECAUSE--

19:06.713 --> 19:09.816
WELL, YOU PROBABLY DON'T
WANT TO HEAR THIS, BUT...

19:09.849 --> 19:10.817
I'M IN LOVE WITH YOU.

19:13.553 --> 19:15.655
REBECCA.

19:15.688 --> 19:17.690
I LOVE YOU.

19:17.724 --> 19:19.726
- HE'S TELLING THE TRUTH, JUDGE.

19:19.759 --> 19:20.893
- GARY.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.530
I LOVE YOU TOO.

19:23.563 --> 19:24.797
- YEAH?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.266
- YEAH, I DO.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.835
I--I LOVE YOU, GARY.

19:31.304 --> 19:32.639
OH, LOOK WHAT I GOT YOU.

19:32.672 --> 19:33.673
JUST A MINUTE.

19:33.706 --> 19:35.542
- WHAT'S HAPPENING?

19:36.876 --> 19:38.511
- HERE.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.280
IT'S A TOOTHBRUSH
FOR YOU TO KEEP AT MY PLACE.

19:40.313 --> 19:42.782
- HEY, THAT--
THAT IS A BIG STEP!

19:42.815 --> 19:44.384
- I KNOW.
- YEAH.

19:44.417 --> 19:45.718
- GREAT NEWS, FRIENDS.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.587
WE HAVE RESOLVED
THE SITUATION OUTSIDE.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.688
THE AREA IS CLEARED,

19:48.721 --> 19:49.989
AND YOU ARE ALL FREE TO GO.

19:50.022 --> 19:50.990
- YES!

19:51.023 --> 19:52.725
- WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE GUNMAN?

19:52.759 --> 19:54.327
- THAT DIDN'T TURN OUT
TOO GREAT.

19:54.361 --> 19:55.828
BANK'S PROBABLY GONNA BE CLOSED
FOR A WHILE.

19:55.862 --> 19:57.597
I RECOMMEND THE BRANCH
OVER ON MAGNOLIA

19:57.630 --> 19:58.698
UNTIL THEY GET THE BLOOD OUT.

19:58.731 --> 19:59.499
GO KINGS!

19:59.532 --> 20:00.467
- IF WE GET ON THAT BUS
RIGHT NOW,

20:00.500 --> 20:02.735
WE WILL BE IN OUR SEATS
WHEN THE PUCK DROPS.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.737
- YES!
- LET'S DO THIS, PEOPLE!

20:04.771 --> 20:06.806
- NO, NO, NO.
NOBODY'S GOING ANYWHERE

20:06.839 --> 20:08.975
TILL WE FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY LAST GRANOLA BAR.

20:09.008 --> 20:10.977
OH, THERE IT IS.
THAT'S FUNNY.

20:11.010 --> 20:12.579
IT WAS IN MY HOLSTER
THE WHOLE TIME.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.780
- TEDWARD...
- COME ON.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.582
- I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED
TO MY GUN.

20:15.615 --> 20:18.818
[crowd noise,
stadium music]

20:18.851 --> 20:21.554
THIRD TRIP
AND NO END IN SIGHT.

20:21.588 --> 20:23.790
THAT CABBAGE BREAKFAST
IS THE BEST IDEA I'VE HAD.

20:23.823 --> 20:24.957
THANKS FOR ALL THIS, JUDGE.

20:24.991 --> 20:25.958
- CHEERS.

20:25.992 --> 20:27.460
YOU CAN REALLY THANK ME,
TEDWARD,

20:27.494 --> 20:28.695
BY TRYING VERY HARD
TO FIND YOUR GUN.

20:28.728 --> 20:30.263
- MM.
IT'S SOMEWHERE.

20:30.297 --> 20:31.264
YEAH.

20:31.298 --> 20:32.432
- YOU KNOW WHAT, TOM?

20:32.465 --> 20:33.433
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

20:33.466 --> 20:36.269
YOU HANDLED THAT LOCKDOWN TODAY
LIKE A REAL MAN.

20:36.303 --> 20:37.470
- THANK YOU.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.640
- COME ON, THAT'S HIGH STICKING!
- COME ON.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.042
- ARE YOU [bleep] KIDDING ME?
[crowd noise in background]

20:43.075 --> 20:45.512
SKATE FASTER TO GET
TO THE [bleep] PLAY,

20:45.545 --> 20:46.879
YOU [bleep] IDIOT.

20:46.913 --> 20:48.681
[bleep].

20:48.715 --> 20:49.882
- YEAH, THAT'S MY SPECIAL LADY.

20:49.916 --> 20:52.752
[phone plays Alouette]

20:52.785 --> 20:53.753
THAT'S WEIRD.

20:53.786 --> 20:55.722
CECILE'S CALLING ME.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.424
BONJOUR.

20:57.457 --> 20:58.725
WHAT?

20:58.758 --> 21:00.460
NO, I DIDN'T CALL YOU.

21:00.493 --> 21:02.295
YEAH, PRETTY SURE.

21:02.329 --> 21:03.296
I SAID WHAT?

21:03.330 --> 21:04.297
NO, NO, I--

21:04.331 --> 21:05.732
- AU REVOIR.

21:05.765 --> 21:08.701
[crowd noise in background]

21:08.735 --> 21:11.971
- I TAKE IT YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO HAVE HER NUMBER.

21:12.004 --> 21:13.706
- GARY.

21:13.740 --> 21:14.941
[both laugh]

21:14.974 --> 21:17.744
[crowd cheering]
