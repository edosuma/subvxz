Hey, thanks a lot.

02:56.403 --> 02:58.489
Well, sure.
Now, where are you headed?

02:58.614 --> 03:00.783
As far away from this town
as I can get.

03:00.908 --> 03:03.244
Actually, I'm trying to make it
up to San Francisco.

03:03.369 --> 03:05.037
San Francisco?

03:05.162 --> 03:08.582
I don't expect you to take me that far
but you're headed in the right direction.

03:08.707 --> 03:11.543
- Oh, sure. Jump in.
- Great.

03:20.761 --> 03:23.514
You don't seem to like this town much.
What do you got against it?

03:23.639 --> 03:26.725
Just two people: my parents.

03:26.850 --> 03:28.936
Are you running away?

03:29.061 --> 03:31.814
I'm over 18.
I can do whatever I like.

03:31.939 --> 03:33.774
I guess you could say
I'm running away.

03:33.899 --> 03:35.734
You shouldn't do that.

03:36.360 --> 03:39.196
Look, you don't know my parents,
especially my mother.

03:39.321 --> 03:40.990
"Where are you going?
Who are you going with?

03:41.115 --> 03:43.033
"What time did you come home?
What did you do?"

03:43.158 --> 03:45.077
She sticks her nose
into everything I do.

03:45.202 --> 03:46.870
Well, that's because she loves you.

03:46.996 --> 03:49.331
No, she don't.
She hates me.

03:49.456 --> 03:51.709
Oh, you sound just like Judy.

03:51.834 --> 03:53.919
- Who's Judy?
- Oh, that's my sister.

03:54.044 --> 03:57.464
She ran away too,
six years ago.

03:57.589 --> 04:01.343
- And never came back?
- No. No, never came back.

04:01.468 --> 04:03.137
Mama never got over it.

04:03.262 --> 04:05.514
Maybe your mama should
have treated her a little bit better.

04:05.639 --> 04:08.017
What do you mean,
treated her better?

04:08.142 --> 04:10.436
Mama treated Judy like gold.

04:10.561 --> 04:13.314
Judy never had to lift a finger,
Mama was always there.

04:13.439 --> 04:15.691
Mama done everything
for that girl.

04:15.816 --> 04:17.692
Then she went and ran away.

04:18.569 --> 04:21.654
Look, I don't know Judy
and I don't know what went on.

04:21.779 --> 04:25.200
All I know is what goes on in my house
and I gotta get away.

04:25.326 --> 04:28.537
Yeah, but... but look
what you're doing to your mama.

04:29.204 --> 04:30.956
Are you trying
to talk me out of this?

04:31.498 --> 04:33.167
- Yeah.
- Why?

04:33.292 --> 04:34.752
You don't even know me.

04:49.892 --> 04:52.227
- What's your name?
- Sharon.

04:52.353 --> 04:55.356
Look, Sharon, you don't know
what you're doing.

04:55.481 --> 04:58.067
You don't know what happens
to girls who run away.

04:58.192 --> 05:01.278
They start running around
with no-good guys and smoking dope

05:01.403 --> 05:04.406
and when that happens,
it's too late.

05:04.531 --> 05:08.035
They can't go and talk to their mamas
because they're ashamed to.

05:08.160 --> 05:10.579
That's not gonna happen
in my case.

05:10.704 --> 05:13.123
Well, if it happened to Judy,
it's gonna happen to you.

05:14.041 --> 05:17.044
Now, listen, why don't you just
let me turn around

05:17.169 --> 05:19.004
and take you back home?

05:19.129 --> 05:20.297
No way.

05:20.839 --> 05:24.510
Oh. You're making a mistake.

05:24.635 --> 05:26.887
Then let me make it.

05:31.183 --> 05:32.434
You just don't care, do you?

05:32.559 --> 05:35.521
You just don't care what hell
you put your mama through.

05:35.646 --> 05:39.233
No, I don't care. And look,
I asked you for a ride, not a lecture.

05:39.358 --> 05:43.153
- Maybe I oughta just get out right here.
- No. No, that's OK.

05:43.278 --> 05:46.782
Listen, uh...
I'll take you down a little further.

05:46.907 --> 05:48.325
OK.

06:11.765 --> 06:13.600
Where are we going?

06:13.725 --> 06:17.312
Oh, I gotta make a delivery
at a farmhouse up here.

06:17.438 --> 06:19.606
It won't take long.

06:49.261 --> 06:51.513
What did we stop here for?

06:52.514 --> 06:54.183
Um...

06:54.308 --> 06:58.145
I'm gonna do Mama a favor.

07:03.567 --> 07:05.986
- That's why.
- No!

07:11.575 --> 07:13.619
- Let me go!
- Do you know what you've...?

07:13.744 --> 07:15.913
Do you know
what you've done to Mama, Judy?

07:18.999 --> 07:21.960
I told you, I'm not Judy.
I told you!

07:22.085 --> 07:25.422
- Tramp! I did that for Mama's sake.
- Let me go!

07:25.547 --> 07:29.134
You tramp! You tramp!

07:29.259 --> 07:31.762
Run away from Mama, will you?

07:31.887 --> 07:35.807
You tramp! You tramp!

07:35.933 --> 07:38.143
Run away from Mama!

07:38.268 --> 07:41.104
- I'm gonna do something to you, Judy!
- No, I'm not Judy!

07:41.230 --> 07:43.774
Like Mama said those other boys
are doing to you, Judy.

07:43.899 --> 07:46.235
No! I'm not Judy!

07:51.615 --> 07:53.909
I'm gonna punish you, Judy,

07:54.034 --> 07:56.954
punish you
for what you've done to Mama.

07:57.079 --> 07:59.414
No! No!

07:59.540 --> 08:01.041
No!

08:01.166 --> 08:05.170
(Screams subside)

08:10.342 --> 08:12.344
(Gasps for air)

08:17.933 --> 08:20.352
(Panting)

08:52.134 --> 08:56.388
You'll never run away again, Judy!

09:31.715 --> 09:34.301
(Starts engine)

10:57.968 --> 11:02.097
Oh, Howard. Your customers
have been calling up all afternoon,

11:02.222 --> 11:04.891
complaining about you being late.
Where have you been?

11:05.016 --> 11:06.768
I got lost, Mr Baldwin.

11:08.061 --> 11:09.312
You got lost?

11:09.438 --> 11:12.023
You've lived around here all of your life.
How could you get lost?

11:12.149 --> 11:13.984
I don't know, I just... did.

11:14.109 --> 11:15.777
You just did?

11:15.902 --> 11:20.574
Let's see that you don't get lost again.
I don't like my customers to complain.

11:20.699 --> 11:24.035
- Now, have you unloaded the truck?
- Oh, no, not yet.

11:24.161 --> 11:25.829
Then I suggest you unload it right away.

11:25.954 --> 11:28.039
We should have been closed
and out of here by now. Go.

11:28.165 --> 11:29.833
OK, Mr Baldwin.

11:30.709 --> 11:31.918
Hm!

11:34.129 --> 11:36.965
Maybe it wasn't his fault, Mr Baldwin.

11:37.090 --> 11:38.508
So, who's fault was it?

11:39.593 --> 11:42.429
I mean, anybody can get lost
once in a while.

11:42.554 --> 11:45.807
And he's generally a good worker.
Isn't he?

11:47.184 --> 11:49.436
Generally, yes.

11:49.561 --> 11:52.647
Something's gotten into him
these past few weeks.

11:52.773 --> 11:54.941
Something's happened to him.

11:55.066 --> 11:57.778
He's always been slow,
but, er...

11:57.903 --> 12:01.406
lately he walks around
like he was in a daze.

12:01.531 --> 12:04.785
I just don't understand it.
I can't figure it out.

12:04.910 --> 12:07.037
Well, I hope he gets over it
pretty soon.

12:08.288 --> 12:10.791
- You got your counter cleared off, Phyllis?
- Yes, Mr Baldwin.

12:10.916 --> 12:12.709
Then, you might as well
run on home.

12:12.834 --> 12:14.878
- OK, thank you.
- We'll be through here in a minute.

12:19.007 --> 12:20.509
(Door closing)

12:22.719 --> 12:24.304
Howie? You're late.

12:24.429 --> 12:27.557
My goodness, I've been worried sick
about you, honey. What took you?

12:27.682 --> 12:30.310
- I got lost on my route.
- How could you get lost?

12:30.435 --> 12:32.395
Doesn't Mr Baldwin
give you a map to use?

12:32.521 --> 12:35.899
- No.
- Well, I'll speak to him about that.

12:36.608 --> 12:37.943
Oh, no, that's OK, Mama.

12:38.068 --> 12:40.403
You don't have to.
I don't think it will happen again.

12:40.529 --> 12:42.280
Then how did it happen this time?

12:45.158 --> 12:46.368
I don't know.

12:47.244 --> 12:49.996
All I know is I found myself
way out on a country road.

12:51.414 --> 12:52.749
I don't know how I got there.

12:52.874 --> 12:55.627
Well, your mind wandered, that's all.
Happens to the best of us.

12:57.087 --> 13:00.799
Howie, I've got your favorite soup.
Homemade split pea.

13:00.924 --> 13:03.760
I've been keeping it
nice and hot for you.

13:12.060 --> 13:14.896
You're not finished, are you?
You haven't eaten half of that.

13:16.106 --> 13:18.316
I'm just not hungry, Mama.

13:18.441 --> 13:20.610
Well, what about dessert?

13:20.735 --> 13:23.530
I've made your favorite,
pineapple upside-down cake.

13:23.655 --> 13:25.907
Oh, no. Maybe I'll have it
tomorrow, Mama.

13:26.032 --> 13:28.451
Tomorrow?
Tomorrow it will be cold and soggy.

13:28.577 --> 13:30.871
Nah, I just don't feel like it, Mama.

13:31.788 --> 13:33.957
I think I'll go down to Swenson's
for a root beer.

13:34.624 --> 13:36.835
Well, there's lots of root beer
in the refrigerator.

13:37.878 --> 13:41.298
I don't know what it is, Mama.
I just feel funny.

13:41.423 --> 13:43.758
I think I'll go down to Swenson's
for a root beer.

13:44.843 --> 13:47.429
I really wish you wouldn't, Howie.

13:47.554 --> 13:50.599
I don't want you on the streets
alone at night. It isn't safe.

13:51.516 --> 13:55.729
After all, since your sister ran away
you're all I got.

13:55.854 --> 13:57.856
You don't wanna worry me,
do you, honey?

13:59.566 --> 14:00.650
No, Mama.

14:01.151 --> 14:03.403
Why don't you take a root beer
out of the refrigerator?

14:03.528 --> 14:06.323
Then you can take it into your room
and work on your hobby.

14:07.657 --> 14:09.075
OK, Mama.

14:39.022 --> 14:42.192
You're not eating your cereal, Howie.
What's the matter?

14:42.317 --> 14:44.736
I haven't got any appetite, Mama.

14:44.861 --> 14:48.031
My goodness, you didn't eat any supper
and now you're not eating any breakfast.

14:48.156 --> 14:50.575
- Don't you feel good?
- I feel OK.

14:50.700 --> 14:53.036
Well, if you don't feel good,
you better not go to work today.

14:53.161 --> 14:55.580
No, I feel OK, Mama.
I'll be OK.

14:56.539 --> 14:58.833
All right, honey. OK.

15:45.213 --> 15:48.133
(Starts engine)

16:14.701 --> 16:16.453
- Hi.
- Hi. Going into town?

16:16.578 --> 16:17.996
Yeah. There where you wanna
be dropped off?

16:18.121 --> 16:20.248
- Yeah, I'll show you where.
- OK, come on.

16:35.055 --> 16:37.515
Are you, uh...
you a high-school girl?

16:37.640 --> 16:39.768
Yeah. What did you think?

16:39.893 --> 16:41.269
Oh, I don't know.

16:41.394 --> 16:44.022
I thought maybe you was running away
from home or something.

16:44.147 --> 16:47.400
Me? No way.
Why should I do that?

16:47.525 --> 16:50.737
Oh, I don't know.
Some girls do, though.

16:50.862 --> 16:53.114
Well, not me.
I love my home.

16:55.742 --> 16:58.912
Do you, uh...?
Do you love your mother?

16:59.037 --> 17:02.332
Sure I love my mother.
She's the greatest mom in the world.

17:03.458 --> 17:05.667
- Why the questions?
- Huh?

17:05.794 --> 17:09.089
Oh, I was just talking, that's all.

17:19.557 --> 17:22.227
Make a right here.
This is 5406.

17:22.352 --> 17:24.145
(Howard) Oh, OK.

17:31.903 --> 17:34.489
Thanks. Bye, thanks again.

17:34.614 --> 17:35.698
Bye-bye.

17:47.627 --> 17:50.630
Oh, Howie, you're home early.
How did everything go today?

17:50.755 --> 17:51.923
OK, Mama.

17:52.048 --> 17:53.716
Go on, honey,
go on in and rest a while.

17:53.842 --> 17:55.260
OK.

17:56.177 --> 17:58.388
Howie, did you eat your lunch today?

17:58.513 --> 18:00.849
- Did you eat your lunch?
- Yeah.

18:00.974 --> 18:03.017
- All of it?
- Yes, Mama.

18:03.560 --> 18:06.729
Did you get that little surprise
I put in for you?

18:06.855 --> 18:10.441
Oh, that apple turnover?
Yeah, thanks, Mama. That was good.

18:10.567 --> 18:12.235
Oh, I knew you'd like it.

18:12.360 --> 18:15.155
Honey, dinner is not quite ready.
Just be a minute or two.

18:16.656 --> 18:18.658
Oh, that's OK.

18:38.803 --> 18:42.724
Here. Well, start with your juice, honey.
There you go.

18:42.849 --> 18:45.602
Oh, wasn't that terrible, Howie?

18:47.061 --> 18:50.690
Well, what can girls like that expect?

18:53.067 --> 18:55.904
I often wonder
if that's what happened to Judy.

18:57.030 --> 18:58.448
I don't know.

19:00.241 --> 19:02.285
But if it did, she had it coming.

19:04.370 --> 19:05.914
I hate to say that, but...

19:07.457 --> 19:09.209
...she had it coming.

19:14.130 --> 19:15.632
Did you hear what I said, Howie?

19:17.425 --> 19:20.929
Howie?
Did you hear what I said?

19:23.348 --> 19:25.683
Yes, Mama, I heard what you said.

19:38.863 --> 19:43.493
It's that report on Sharon Parker,
Captain, that runaway homicide.

19:43.618 --> 19:45.119
Right.

19:48.456 --> 19:51.376
Yeah, it only confirms
what I learned from her mother.

19:51.501 --> 19:53.670
- Trouble at home?
- Yeah.

19:53.795 --> 19:56.130
Started when she dropped out of school
a couple of years ago.

19:56.256 --> 19:58.091
The mother was crabbing
at her about it.

19:58.216 --> 20:00.551
She had no idea
the kid would up and run away.

20:00.677 --> 20:04.097
You know, some kids are like that.
Headstrong.

20:04.222 --> 20:07.141
They have the idea they can get away
and make it on their own.

20:07.267 --> 20:10.853
Yeah, and look what happened.
She barely made it out of town.

20:12.021 --> 20:13.815
Nothing new to go on, huh?

20:13.940 --> 20:18.278
Nothing. No reports
of anybody seeing her at all.

20:18.403 --> 20:21.531
I still think
it was a boyfriend of hers.

20:21.656 --> 20:23.825
Or maybe an ex-boyfriend.

20:23.950 --> 20:26.077
In a way I hope you're right.

20:27.203 --> 20:29.497
I hope it was just a jealousy thing
or something like that.

20:29.622 --> 20:32.834
- I hate to think it was something else.
- Like what?

20:34.335 --> 20:37.714
Like the beginning of a rash
of pointless, senseless murders.

20:39.465 --> 20:40.842
A nut on the loose, you mean?

20:40.967 --> 20:42.510
That's exactly what I mean.

20:42.635 --> 20:46.973
Like the Zodiac Killer in San Francisco
or the Skid Row Slasher in Los Angeles

20:47.098 --> 20:51.102
or that nut down in Houston.
Mental cases, all of them.

20:51.227 --> 20:52.937
But who knows?

20:53.062 --> 20:55.440
Maybe we've got our own mental case
who suddenly decided to go out

20:55.565 --> 20:57.984
and... do his thing.

20:59.694 --> 21:03.364
Well, if we have,
I guess we'll soon find out.

22:22.527 --> 22:23.528
- Hi!
- Hi.

22:23.653 --> 22:25.822
- Where are you headed?
- Same way you are.

22:25.947 --> 22:27.365
I don't know what you mean.

22:27.490 --> 22:30.660
I mean I'm just headed through town.
I don't care where I end up.

22:30.785 --> 22:33.788
Well, listen,
I'm headed south right now.

22:33.913 --> 22:36.666
- That's cool.
- Well, come on. I'll give you a lift.

22:42.588 --> 22:44.090
Phew!

22:53.516 --> 22:55.518
(Starts engine)

22:55.643 --> 22:58.187
Got a cigarette?

22:58.312 --> 23:00.022
No.

23:00.148 --> 23:02.775
Ah. That's cool.

23:02.900 --> 23:06.487
I could sure use one,
but that's OK.

23:07.989 --> 23:10.491
- What's your name?
- Howard.

23:10.616 --> 23:12.952
Hi, I'm Gail.

23:14.954 --> 23:16.456
Do you live in this town?

23:16.581 --> 23:18.541
Yeah, yeah.

23:19.125 --> 23:20.626
Like it?

23:21.461 --> 23:23.713
Yeah, yeah, I like it.

23:25.548 --> 23:27.049
Where are you from?

23:28.676 --> 23:30.178
Nowhere.

23:31.095 --> 23:32.180
Huh?

23:32.305 --> 23:37.310
I mean, I'm on the road.
I pad down here and I pad down there.

23:40.605 --> 23:42.148
Are you a runaway?

23:44.025 --> 23:46.360
Well, I guess you could say that.

23:46.486 --> 23:49.155
But I've been on the road now
for over two months.

23:49.280 --> 23:51.616
That makes me on my own now,
don't it?

23:51.741 --> 23:52.950
I guess so.

23:54.035 --> 23:55.786
But your mother
must be pretty worried.

23:57.497 --> 23:58.998
I hope she is.

24:01.167 --> 24:04.587
I hope she bites her fingernails
every night.

24:34.992 --> 24:36.619
(Stops engine)

24:38.204 --> 24:40.957
What did...?
What did you pull in here for?

24:41.082 --> 24:42.792
You gotta take a leak?

24:44.210 --> 24:46.295
No, I don't gotta take a leak.

24:47.505 --> 24:49.924
Then what did you pull in here for?

24:50.049 --> 24:52.134
You get in the back.

24:53.177 --> 24:58.182
Oh, I get it. The time has come
to pay for the ride, huh?

24:58.307 --> 25:00.643
OK, that's cool.

25:00.768 --> 25:05.106
You're not exactly Burt Reynolds
but it's still cool.

25:15.700 --> 25:18.744
I'm gonna punish you, Judy,
for what you done to Mama.

25:18.869 --> 25:21.205
Judy? Hey, man, I'm Gail!

25:21.330 --> 25:23.916
Get your hands off of me!

25:24.750 --> 25:27.795
- Stop!
- I'm gonna punish you.

25:35.678 --> 25:39.265
You creep, let me outta here!

25:40.516 --> 25:44.520
Let me out! Let me out!

26:11.422 --> 26:16.135
You liked it, didn't you?
You pig! You liked it.

26:16.260 --> 26:20.431
- You rotten pig! You liked it!
- Let me outta here!

26:20.556 --> 26:22.725
Let me out! No!

26:22.850 --> 26:26.270
No! No!

26:31.233 --> 26:34.070
(Howard) You liked it, didn't you?
(Gail) Let me outta here!

26:34.195 --> 26:37.073
Didn't you? You liked it!

27:21.951 --> 27:24.120
(Starts engine)

28:09.081 --> 28:10.875
Oh, hi, Mr Baldwin.
I'm back.

28:11.000 --> 28:13.544
Yeah, so I see.
But still a little late, huh?

28:13.669 --> 28:15.421
Well, I had a lot of deliveries to make.

28:15.546 --> 28:18.883
Well, there's one you didn't make.
Mrs Murdock's.

28:19.008 --> 28:20.676
She wasn't home.

28:20.801 --> 28:22.887
Well, you were supposed
to be there before three.

28:23.012 --> 28:25.473
She called up here
and hopped all over me about it.

28:25.598 --> 28:27.641
Be sure to make hers
the first delivery in the morning.

28:27.767 --> 28:29.602
That means I have
to change my route all around.

28:29.727 --> 28:33.814
Then change it all around.
I can't afford to lose Mrs Murdock.

28:33.939 --> 28:36.400
She's one of the best customers
we've got.

28:37.943 --> 28:39.820
(Howard) All right, Mr Baldwin.

28:41.947 --> 28:45.117
- Here's the delivery slips for today.
- OK.

28:57.880 --> 29:01.133
- He's sure a grouch, isn't he?
- Yeah.

29:01.258 --> 29:05.346
He snaps at me too.
Sometimes I feel like quitting this job.

29:05.471 --> 29:10.226
- You're gonna quit?
- No. I just feel like it sometimes.

29:10.351 --> 29:12.853
Oh, Phyllis, I hope you never quit.

29:12.978 --> 29:15.189
You're the nicest girl I know.

29:22.488 --> 29:24.698
You're supposed to eat that, Howie,
not play with it.

29:24.824 --> 29:26.283
It don't taste good, Mama.

29:26.408 --> 29:28.410
It's the same way I always make it.
I didn't change it none.

29:28.536 --> 29:29.703
Well, maybe it's just me.

29:29.829 --> 29:32.790
Must be just you.
You always loved it before.

29:33.624 --> 29:37.711
Honey, please try and eat a little of it.
You gotta eat to keep up your strength.

29:41.257 --> 29:44.009
Oh... it's making me sick, Mama.

29:44.134 --> 29:46.637
Oh, well, don't eat no more
if it's gonna turn your stomach.

29:46.762 --> 29:48.097
I'm sorry, Mama.

29:48.222 --> 29:51.392
Well, honey, let me get it
out of your sight now.

29:55.729 --> 29:59.066
What about dessert, honey?
Would you like a little dessert?

29:59.191 --> 30:02.736
- What is it?
- One of your favorites, vanilla pudding.

30:04.113 --> 30:05.948
No.

30:06.073 --> 30:08.534
Maybe you'd like a root beer.
That might help settle your stomach.

30:08.659 --> 30:10.160
Yeah, OK, I'll take a root beer.

30:10.286 --> 30:13.330
Why don't you go turn on the TV?
I'll bring it to you there.

30:14.957 --> 30:16.208
OK.

30:21.505 --> 30:25.676
(TV) '...the most grizzly slaying in the history
of the Crescent City Police Department.

30:25.801 --> 30:29.221
'The girl's half-nude body

Howie, do you hear what I'm saying?

31:06.759 --> 31:08.928
What's wrong with you?

31:09.970 --> 31:11.472
Huh?

31:11.597 --> 31:14.224
Oh, honey, you...
I think you've got a fever.

31:15.726 --> 31:18.228
You better go straight to bed.

31:18.354 --> 31:20.314
I don't wanna go to bed.

31:21.023 --> 31:23.192
Now, Howie, please, listen to me.

31:23.317 --> 31:26.278
I want you to take a couple of aspirins
and go right to bed.

31:27.613 --> 31:28.864
OK, Mama.

31:28.989 --> 31:32.576
Now, I'll get the aspirins and you can
wash them down with the root beer.

31:32.701 --> 31:34.203
All right, honey?

31:34.328 --> 31:35.746
That's a good boy.

31:48.133 --> 31:51.011
(Groaning)

32:01.063 --> 32:03.148
Howie? Howie?

32:03.273 --> 32:05.776
Howie, it's all right.
It's all right, Howie.

32:05.901 --> 32:08.737
- Yes, it's all right. It's all right. Yes.
- Mama.

32:08.862 --> 32:10.864
- It's all right.
- What's the matter, Mama?

32:10.990 --> 32:12.992
You had a nightmare, honey.
You were yelling.

32:13.117 --> 32:16.036
- But Mama's here, honey.
- Oh, Mama. I'm cold, Mama.

32:16.161 --> 32:18.330
I'm cold. Mama.

32:18.455 --> 32:20.040
- Yes, yes. Yes.
- I'm cold.

32:20.165 --> 32:22.001
- Mama will keep you warm, honey.
- I'm cold.

32:22.126 --> 32:23.794
- Mama will keep you warm.
- I'm so cold.

32:23.919 --> 32:25.087
Yes.

32:33.595 --> 32:36.432
Good morning, honey.
I called Mr Baldwin.

32:36.557 --> 32:39.226
- He's gonna take your route today.
- Oh? Was he mad?

32:39.351 --> 32:42.688
Doesn't matter if he's mad or not.
You can't work if you're sick.

32:42.813 --> 32:45.315
- I feel better, though.
- Oh, I'm sure glad of that.

32:45.441 --> 32:48.694
But you need a day off.
My, you were so feverish last night.

32:48.819 --> 32:51.363
- Can I work on my models?
- Yeah, I guess you could do that.

32:51.488 --> 32:54.408
- Did you drink your orange juice?
- Oh, it don't taste good.

32:54.533 --> 32:56.618
Honey, it's good for you.
Now, drink it.

32:56.744 --> 32:58.996
Then you can work on your models.

32:59.121 --> 33:00.372
That's a good boy.

33:16.305 --> 33:18.891
Hey, drunk, wake up
before you fall off that chair.

33:19.016 --> 33:20.768
Oh, thanks.

33:20.893 --> 33:22.394
(Scoffs)

33:22.519 --> 33:24.521
- How's it going, Jackie?
- Fine, Captain.

33:24.646 --> 33:25.981
Good.

33:27.066 --> 33:28.484
Oh, Captain?

33:30.486 --> 33:31.779
(Shaw) Hm.

33:32.863 --> 33:34.823
What's with that coat hanger, anyway?

33:34.948 --> 33:38.118
Is there something significant about it
or was it just laying around?

33:38.243 --> 33:39.828
What could be significant about it?

33:39.953 --> 33:42.456
No, I think it just happened
to be handy and he used it.

33:42.581 --> 33:44.708
But why? I mean,
why go through all that trouble?

33:44.833 --> 33:46.752
He could have killed her
without a coat hanger.

33:46.877 --> 33:49.797
Why? Because he's a nut.
A nut doesn't need a reason.

33:51.006 --> 33:52.758
And I'll tell you something else:

33:52.883 --> 33:55.469
no 97-pound weakling
is gonna twist a coat hanger

33:55.594 --> 33:57.346
around somebody's neck like that.

33:57.471 --> 33:59.681
Well, you're full of good news,
aren't you?

33:59.807 --> 34:01.225
Sorry.

34:01.350 --> 34:02.810
All right, stay with it.

34:04.978 --> 34:06.438
Good morning, Mr Baldwin.

34:06.563 --> 34:09.358
(Clears throat) Good morning.
Been waiting for you.

34:09.483 --> 34:11.235
- How you feeling?
- Oh, I'm feeling OK.

34:11.360 --> 34:14.029
I had a little touch of the flu
but I'm feeling OK now.

34:14.154 --> 34:15.614
I'm glad to hear that.

34:15.739 --> 34:18.784
I wasn't looking forward
to running your route again today.

34:18.909 --> 34:22.830
Mm... There's something
I wanted to ask you about.

34:22.955 --> 34:25.456
I found this in your truck yesterday
with no ticket on it.

34:25.581 --> 34:28.710
Obviously it's one of your customers.
But which one?

34:32.422 --> 34:34.466
I... I don't know, Mr Baldwin.

34:36.510 --> 34:38.011
While you're out there today,

34:38.137 --> 34:40.806
see if you can remember,
and be more careful with your orders.

34:40.931 --> 34:43.641
Every order's gotta have a ticket on it.
I've told you that.

34:44.851 --> 34:47.437
OK. I'm sorry, Mr Baldwin.

34:47.563 --> 34:48.981
All right.

34:52.192 --> 34:55.445
Oh, I told my mother
you were sick yesterday, Howard.

34:55.571 --> 34:57.906
She told me to say
she hopes you're feeling better.

34:58.031 --> 35:01.451
Oh, well, thanks, Phyllis. Thanks.
Yeah, I'm feeling better now.

35:02.119 --> 35:03.537
You know something, Phyllis?

35:04.163 --> 35:07.708
Next to my mother,
your mother is the nicest woman in town.

35:07.833 --> 35:09.710
Thank you, Howard.
I'll tell her that.

35:09.835 --> 35:12.963
Can't you two find any work
to do out there?

36:24.159 --> 36:27.079
- (Davis) How far are you going?
- (Girl) Pretty far. New York.

36:36.171 --> 36:38.548
(Davis) I'm not going quite that far.

36:38.674 --> 36:42.010
(Girl) I didn't think so,
but every little bit helps.

36:48.183 --> 36:50.435
(Davis) May I ask
why you're going to New York?

36:50.560 --> 36:53.647
(Girl) I'm gonna be a model
and New York's where it's at.

36:53.772 --> 36:55.524
(Davis) Do you live here in town?

36:55.649 --> 36:57.484
(Girl) No, I'm from Carlton Springs.

36:57.609 --> 37:00.946
(Davis) Yes, I know Carlton Springs.
Nice town.

37:01.071 --> 37:02.823
Do your parents know
what you're doing?

37:02.948 --> 37:04.950
(Girl) I don't get along with my parents.

37:05.075 --> 37:08.078
(Davis) So you're running away.
Is that it?

37:08.203 --> 37:10.080
(Girl) That's right.

37:10.205 --> 37:13.583
My parents don't understand me
so why should I live with them?

37:13.709 --> 37:17.212
Look, I'm better off on my own.
They don't care about me anyway.

37:20.674 --> 37:23.677
- (Davis) Are you sure of that?
- (Girl) Sure I'm sure.

37:23.802 --> 37:27.222
(Davis) Well, that's too bad.

37:27.347 --> 37:30.309
(Girl) Yes, it is too bad
but that's the way it is.

37:32.227 --> 37:35.397
- Is this as far as you go?
- Yes, and it's as far as you go too.

37:35.522 --> 37:37.774
I'm Lieutenant Davis,
special police officer.

37:37.899 --> 37:40.444
You and I are going in to have
a little talk with Captain Shaw.

37:47.868 --> 37:52.664
Pamela Lathrop, 611 West Olive Drive,
Carlton Springs.

37:52.789 --> 37:54.666
You're about 100 miles from home,
aren't you?

37:54.791 --> 37:56.376
That's right.

37:58.837 --> 38:01.048
Four dollars and 70 cents.
That's not much, is it?

38:01.882 --> 38:03.008
It's enough.

38:03.133 --> 38:06.136
What do you expect to do in New York
with four dollars and 70 cents?

38:06.261 --> 38:09.639
I'm gonna get a job
and there are lots of jobs in New York.

38:09.765 --> 38:11.641
Not for 16-year-old girls.

38:12.601 --> 38:16.271
Well, I'm gonna stay with a friend
for a while until I get settled.

38:16.396 --> 38:19.149
- What friend?
- You mean you wanna know her name?

38:19.274 --> 38:21.109
I wanna know her name,
address, phone number

38:21.234 --> 38:23.195
and anything else
you can tell me about her.

38:24.363 --> 38:26.782
Well, her name is Helen Smith.

38:27.366 --> 38:29.242
And I don't know her exact address.

38:29.368 --> 38:32.537
I mean, I know where she lives and all,
but I really don't know the number.

38:34.748 --> 38:37.959
There is no Helen Smith, Pam.
You don't know anybody in New York.

38:38.085 --> 38:40.337
You're just going there
with four dollars and 70 cents

38:40.462 --> 38:43.048
and a crazy idea that something
wonderful is gonna happen to you.

38:43.507 --> 38:46.676
Well, you can forget it.
That only happens in the movies.

38:46.802 --> 38:47.844
Go back home, Pam.

38:48.678 --> 38:49.805
No.

38:49.930 --> 38:52.474
I have the right to go to New York
if I want to.

38:52.599 --> 38:55.060
You might not even get there.
Hitchhiking can be dangerous.

38:55.769 --> 38:58.021
I'll take my chances, OK?

38:59.731 --> 39:04.152
Look, I guess I better explain to you
what's going on here in Crescent City.

39:04.277 --> 39:08.323
We have a mental case running loose
around here who picks up hitchhikers.

39:08.448 --> 39:09.950
Girl hitchhikers.

39:10.075 --> 39:12.494
And what he does to them
isn't very pleasant.

39:12.619 --> 39:14.037
Like what?

39:14.162 --> 39:16.665
Like raping them
and then killing them.

39:18.166 --> 39:20.627
Like I said, I'll take my chances,
all right?

39:22.254 --> 39:25.048
Lieutenant, would you take
Miss Lathrop across the hall?

39:25.173 --> 39:27.676
- What for?
- What for?

39:27.801 --> 39:29.553
For a few minutes.

39:47.404 --> 39:49.531
(Telephone ringing)

39:57.456 --> 40:01.710
Ginny? Come in here
and pick up the phone.

40:09.426 --> 40:10.427
Hello?

40:10.552 --> 40:15.265
Mrs Lathrop? This is Captain Shaw
of the Crescent City Police Department.

40:15.390 --> 40:16.850
We have your daughter here.

40:18.101 --> 40:20.187
What? I don't understand.

40:20.312 --> 40:22.772
We picked her up, hitchhiking.

40:22.898 --> 40:23.899
'Who are you again?'

40:24.024 --> 40:25.775
Captain Shaw,
Crescent City Police.

40:27.486 --> 40:29.196
What kind of trouble is she in?

40:29.321 --> 40:31.490
Well, she's not in any trouble, yet.

40:32.157 --> 40:34.326
Then what did you pick her up for?

40:34.451 --> 40:36.786
'Do you know
that she's running away from home?'

40:38.497 --> 40:39.623
Yes, I know.

40:40.665 --> 40:43.460
'Well, we'd like you to come
and pick her up.'

40:43.585 --> 40:47.422
Drive all the way over to Crescent City?
That's over 100 miles.

40:48.215 --> 40:49.883
She's your daughter, Mrs Lathrop.

40:50.926 --> 40:52.802
But she hasn't done anything.

40:52.928 --> 40:55.055
That's not the point.

40:55.180 --> 40:58.683
She's a runaway, she has no money,
she's hitchhiking.

40:58.808 --> 41:00.519
She's almost certain
to get into trouble,

41:00.644 --> 41:02.270
'possibly serious trouble.'

41:03.146 --> 41:05.440
How can you say
it's almost certain?

41:05.565 --> 41:09.444
Haven't you heard about the killer
that we have here in Crescent City?

41:09.569 --> 41:10.946
Well, he hasn't been caught yet.

41:11.571 --> 41:14.574
I don't think Pam would accept a ride
from anybody like that.

41:14.699 --> 41:17.118
'He's not wearing a sign
around his neck, Mrs Lathrop.'

41:17.244 --> 41:18.787
(Mr Lathrop) Who is that?

41:20.038 --> 41:22.290
(Mrs Lathrop) Captain Shaw
of the Crescent City Police.

41:22.415 --> 41:23.667
They picked up Pam.

41:23.792 --> 41:26.670
She hasn't done anything
but he wants us to go get her.

41:26.795 --> 41:28.547
Let me talk to him.

41:29.839 --> 41:32.926
Hello, this is Pam's father.
What's this all about?

41:33.051 --> 41:34.344
This is Captain Shaw of...

41:34.469 --> 41:36.513
'We know that.
Get to the bottom line.'

41:37.931 --> 41:41.226
All right, I will. We want you to come
and pick up your daughter.

41:41.351 --> 41:44.437
No way. She's run away from home
and that's it.

41:44.563 --> 41:46.606
I'm sure if you come and talk to her

41:46.731 --> 41:48.775
you can straighten this thing out
between you.

41:48.900 --> 41:52.445
We tried talking to her.
It didn't work.

41:52.571 --> 41:56.575
Besides, if we brought her home tonight
she'd just be gone again tomorrow.

41:56.700 --> 41:58.952
'Well, maybe not.
I mean, it's worth a try, isn't it?'

41:59.077 --> 42:00.704
No, it isn't worth a try.

42:00.829 --> 42:03.123
You're wasting your time
calling, Captain.

42:03.248 --> 42:05.792
Mr Lathrop,
as I explained to your wife,

42:05.917 --> 42:08.253
we have a mental case
on the loose over here

42:08.378 --> 42:10.547
and I'm sure you know
what that means.

42:10.672 --> 42:12.716
Yeah, it means
you oughta keep her locked up.

42:12.841 --> 42:15.802
We can't keep her locked up.
She hasn't done anything.

42:15.927 --> 42:18.263
We can hold her until you come
and get her and that's all.

42:18.388 --> 42:19.848
Otherwise, we have to release her.

42:19.973 --> 42:23.560
(Mr Lathrop) 'Then release her.
I don't care what you do with her.'

42:23.685 --> 42:25.687
You're pretty hard to believe,
Mr Lathrop.

42:25.812 --> 42:29.482
Listen, as far as I'm concerned,
she's not my daughter anymore.

42:29.608 --> 42:31.651
'Well, will you at least
send her bus fare?'

42:31.776 --> 42:32.777
What?

42:32.902 --> 42:35.113
'Send her bus fare and we'll put her
on a bus headed for home

42:35.238 --> 42:36.740
'and hope she gets there.'

42:36.865 --> 42:39.117
Look, aren't I getting
through to you, Captain?

42:39.242 --> 42:41.578
I don't want her home!

42:41.703 --> 42:43.705
Look, I gotta go to work now, all right?

42:43.830 --> 42:45.582
Thanks for calling, huh?

42:49.294 --> 42:51.046
Get me a beer.

43:00.680 --> 43:04.893
- Well? Did you talk to her folks?
- Yeah.

43:05.018 --> 43:08.438
- And?
- They don't want any part of her.

43:09.147 --> 43:10.982
You mean they're not gonna
come and get her?

43:11.107 --> 43:13.276
They won't even send bus fare.

43:13.401 --> 43:15.570
Well, what the hell is wrong with them?

43:15.695 --> 43:19.115
Seems there are delinquent parents
as well as delinquent children.

43:19.240 --> 43:22.243
Well, then, what are we gonna do?
We can't release her.

43:22.369 --> 43:23.411
We've got to.

43:24.037 --> 43:25.789
But that nut out there!

43:25.914 --> 43:29.417
I know, I know, but...
we've got no choice.

43:30.627 --> 43:32.712
She's not really a runaway.

43:32.837 --> 43:35.840
Well, she left home, yeah,
but with her parents' consent.

43:35.965 --> 43:39.636
Now, that makes her what the law
in this state calls an emancipated child.

43:39.761 --> 43:42.931
I think it's ridiculous
but that's the way the law looks at it.

43:43.056 --> 43:46.685
It's something like a boy her age
running off and joining the navy.

43:46.810 --> 43:48.687
There's just no way we can hold her.

43:48.812 --> 43:50.397
Well, then what are we gonna do?

43:51.815 --> 43:54.526
We take her to the edge of town
and drop her off.

43:56.027 --> 43:57.028
And pray.

44:19.509 --> 44:20.927
(Girl #1) There's Howard.

44:25.640 --> 44:28.476
Hey, Howard?
Wanna shoot a few?

44:28.601 --> 44:30.687
- (Girl #2) Yes, come on.
- (Howard) Yeah, sure.

44:39.529 --> 44:40.613
(Ball bounces off hoop)

44:40.739 --> 44:42.657
- (Girl #1) Come on, try again.
- (Girl #2) Try again.

44:43.366 --> 44:44.909
(Girl #1) Come on.

44:47.829 --> 44:50.081
(Girl #2) Good try.
Come on, try again.

44:50.206 --> 44:51.833
(Girl #1) One more.
Try your best.

44:54.919 --> 44:56.171
(Girl #2) Almost.

44:56.296 --> 44:58.715
Oh, that's OK, kids.
I'll see you later.

44:58.840 --> 45:00.258
- (Girl #1) OK.
- (Girl #2) Bye.

45:02.510 --> 45:03.511
(Girl #1) Whoa!

45:06.097 --> 45:08.099
(Girl #2) Come on, you gotta get it.

46:11.412 --> 46:12.413
(Sighs)

46:12.539 --> 46:13.957
Wow!

46:14.082 --> 46:18.586
Ah. I didn't think
anybody was gonna come along.

46:18.711 --> 46:20.213
Uh, where are you going?

46:20.338 --> 46:22.090
Anywhere, as long as I get off this road.

46:22.215 --> 46:23.925
I've been out here for over an hour.

46:41.860 --> 46:44.195
Didn't I see you hitchhiking before?

46:44.320 --> 46:46.990
- Did you? Where?
- Oh, back in town.

46:48.366 --> 46:51.119
I guess so, but why the hell
didn't you pick me up?

46:51.244 --> 46:53.913
Well, somebody else got there first.

46:54.038 --> 46:55.415
Oh, wow!

46:55.540 --> 46:57.375
What a bummer that was.

46:57.500 --> 47:00.211
- You saw that?
- What do you mean?

47:01.880 --> 47:04.465
Know who that dude was
who picked me up?

47:04.591 --> 47:06.426
A cop.

47:06.551 --> 47:08.303
Huh?

47:08.428 --> 47:12.432
That's right, a plain-clothes cop.

47:12.557 --> 47:16.269
You know where he took me?
Right straight to the police station.

47:16.394 --> 47:18.229
Because you were hitchhiking?

47:19.230 --> 47:20.982
No, that wasn't the reason.

47:22.191 --> 47:24.736
It was because I told him
I was running away from home,

47:24.861 --> 47:26.070
which I am.

47:26.195 --> 47:28.364
How the hell
did I know he was a cop?

47:28.489 --> 47:29.532
(Howard) Hm.

47:30.074 --> 47:33.912
Well, uh... what happened
down at the police station?

47:35.872 --> 47:37.999
Big scene with the big chief.

47:39.208 --> 47:41.294
Tried to scare me.

47:41.419 --> 47:43.463
Told me about some crazy
running around loose,

47:43.588 --> 47:45.840
just trying to scare me.

47:45.965 --> 47:48.092
I'm Pam. Who are you?

47:48.217 --> 47:51.429
Oh, I'm Howard.
What are you, uh...?

47:51.554 --> 47:53.348
What are you doing
way out here, though?

47:54.515 --> 47:56.601
This is where they dumped me off.

47:56.726 --> 47:59.145
After all sorts of lectures
and warnings.

47:59.270 --> 48:02.607
Right out here, in the middle of nowhere.
Would you believe that?

48:02.732 --> 48:05.318
Why, I'm sure glad
you came along, Howard.

48:06.527 --> 48:12.116
Well, are you going back to your mother
or are you still running away from home?

48:12.951 --> 48:14.243
Going back?

48:15.411 --> 48:17.163
No way!

48:17.288 --> 48:19.958
I never wanna see my mother again.

49:09.215 --> 49:11.134
Oh, Mr Baldwin?

49:11.259 --> 49:13.094
Would you mind telling me
where you've been?

49:13.219 --> 49:14.637
I... I lost my glasses.

49:14.762 --> 49:17.223
So I see. And that's
what slowed you down, huh?

49:17.348 --> 49:19.475
Sure, I can't see too good
without my glasses.

49:19.600 --> 49:21.686
Well, where did you lose them?

49:21.811 --> 49:24.814
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

49:24.939 --> 49:27.275
You lose a pair of glasses
and you don't know where?

49:27.400 --> 49:29.819
No, the last thing I remember is
I was driving along

49:29.944 --> 49:31.529
and then I didn't have them on.

49:31.654 --> 49:34.699
Look, Howard,
in order to lose a pair of glasses,

49:34.824 --> 49:38.745
you have to take them off somewhere
or they have to fall off somewhere.

49:38.870 --> 49:40.079
Do you understand?

49:40.204 --> 49:42.749
And you mean to tell me
you don't remember where...?

49:42.874 --> 49:44.375
I really don't remember.

49:45.752 --> 49:48.004
I don't suppose
you got another pair either.

49:48.129 --> 49:50.465
Oh, yes, I got another pair.

49:50.590 --> 49:52.550
- You have a pair?
- Yeah, I got a pair at home.

49:52.675 --> 49:54.510
I hope you don't forget
to bring them tomorrow.

49:54.635 --> 49:56.471
Oh, no, I won't forget them,
I won't forget them.

49:56.596 --> 50:01.184
And, uh... I don't suppose you remember
where this came from either.

50:01.309 --> 50:04.979
No, no. With all the trouble I had today
I didn't have time to think about that.

50:05.104 --> 50:07.398
Well, will you try
to think about it tomorrow?

50:07.523 --> 50:10.193
Yes, sir. Yes, sir, Mr Baldwin.
I better unload my truck.

50:10.318 --> 50:12.987
Yes, I sure think you better.
Now, go on and unload it.

50:15.782 --> 50:17.033
(Sighs)

50:18.993 --> 50:20.244
Now, wait a minute.

50:20.369 --> 50:22.538
I know where they are, Howie.
Just a second.

50:22.663 --> 50:24.749
I put them behind the...

50:24.874 --> 50:26.334
I know.

50:26.459 --> 50:30.713
I know exactly where they are.
Yep, there they are.

50:30.838 --> 50:33.508
Aren't you glad I had a second pair made
just for such an emergency?

50:33.633 --> 50:35.051
Oh, thanks, Mom.

50:35.176 --> 50:36.761
Well, honey,
you must be starved to death.

50:36.886 --> 50:39.138
I'm gonna make you
some nice hot potato soup.

50:39.263 --> 50:42.350
Oh, no, Mom, I'm not too hungry,
so don't make me too much.

50:42.475 --> 50:45.895
Howie, you have to eat, honey.
You're gonna get skinny as a rail.

50:46.020 --> 50:48.356
Now, you don't wanna get
skinny as a rail, do you?

50:49.315 --> 50:51.317
I'm gonna make you
some potato soup anyway.

50:51.442 --> 50:54.028
Oh, Mom, I'm just thirsty.
Can I have a root beer?

50:54.153 --> 50:56.030
Of course you can have
a root beer afterwards

50:56.155 --> 50:57.740
while you're working on your hobby.

50:57.865 --> 50:59.283
Now, go on, get washed up.

50:59.408 --> 51:00.910
Attaboy.

51:27.728 --> 51:29.063
(Sobbing)

52:14.192 --> 52:16.527
(Starts engine)

52:39.634 --> 52:41.052
(Brakes squeal)

53:03.532 --> 53:05.993
- It's my fault.
- Why is it your fault?

53:06.118 --> 53:07.536
I should have held her.

53:07.662 --> 53:10.748
Should have trumped up charges
against her, regardless.

53:10.873 --> 53:12.959
Anything to keep her from this.

53:13.084 --> 53:14.460
But I didn't.

53:16.462 --> 53:18.965
- What's that?
- What?

53:19.507 --> 53:20.841
(Davis) Over there.

53:41.195 --> 53:42.863
Well, they're not hers.
We know that.

53:42.989 --> 53:45.283
That makes it pretty obvious, then,
doesn't it?

53:45.408 --> 53:47.201
Let's hope these have
a better story to tell

53:47.326 --> 53:49.120
than that damn twisted coat hanger.

54:14.103 --> 54:17.481
Bill, take these glasses
to the fingerprint lab right away.

54:17.606 --> 54:20.651
- Top priority, right?
- Top top priority.

54:21.360 --> 54:22.361
(Sighs)

54:22.486 --> 54:24.572
And now for that call.

54:24.697 --> 54:25.990
Her parents.

54:26.741 --> 54:27.742
Right.

54:29.035 --> 54:30.870
I don't envy you.

54:30.995 --> 54:33.497
Boy, I'd like to tell them,
"I told you so."

55:24.965 --> 55:26.675
Well, hello there!

55:26.801 --> 55:28.803
Oh, hi.

55:28.928 --> 55:31.680
You are going
to Highway 60, aren't you?

55:31.806 --> 55:34.725
Er... yeah.
Yeah, I'm eating my lunch right now

55:34.850 --> 55:37.686
and then I got a couple of deliveries
to make before I get up there.

55:37.812 --> 55:39.397
That's OK.

55:42.942 --> 55:43.943
(Sighs)

55:44.068 --> 55:45.277
Phew!

55:45.403 --> 55:49.615
Feels good to get off my feet.
I have been walking five miles.

55:49.740 --> 55:51.409
And with this thing.

55:51.534 --> 55:53.953
Are you just hitchhiking
through town or what?

55:54.912 --> 55:56.997
I am spreading my wings.

55:58.082 --> 55:59.083
Huh?

56:00.251 --> 56:04.922
I am leaving my nowhere home.
I am leaving this nowhere town.

56:05.047 --> 56:07.716
I am leaving this nowhere state.

56:07.842 --> 56:10.803
Oh, I'm sorry.
Maybe you like it here.

56:12.263 --> 56:13.931
Yeah, yeah, I like it OK.

56:14.807 --> 56:17.393
Well, people are different.

56:17.518 --> 56:19.311
I'm different.

56:21.147 --> 56:22.356
Different from what?

56:23.774 --> 56:26.026
Different from other people.

56:26.152 --> 56:27.153
Oh.

56:28.362 --> 56:30.948
Um... do you know
what I'm talking about?

56:31.657 --> 56:35.703
Yes, sure. You don't like the people
in this town so you're running away.

56:38.581 --> 56:44.128
That's... I don't think you understand
but that's basically it.

56:46.422 --> 56:48.257
Don't you even like your mother?

56:48.966 --> 56:51.385
My mother?
Oh, she's the worst of all.

56:51.510 --> 56:53.429
I mean, she's an absolute peasant.

56:53.554 --> 56:56.765
I mean... OK, she should have
some understanding, shouldn't she?

56:56.891 --> 57:00.144
I mean, my friends are my friends
and she should like them, shouldn't she?

57:00.269 --> 57:01.562
Not if they're no good.

57:02.188 --> 57:05.274
Your mom just didn't want you running
around with the wrong people, that's all.

57:05.399 --> 57:09.195
(Clears throat) Well, I can see
you don't understand.

57:10.571 --> 57:12.364
Well...

57:12.490 --> 57:16.577
I wouldn't care
if that woman died tomorrow.

57:18.829 --> 57:19.830
Ah!

57:26.086 --> 57:27.296
Yeah. What?

57:27.421 --> 57:29.507
Good news and bad.
Which do you want first?

57:29.632 --> 57:31.634
Well, let's try the good.
That will be a change.

57:31.759 --> 57:35.012
Well, we got positive prints
on the glasses, male.

57:35.137 --> 57:37.139
And now the bad:
nothing on file here locally.

57:37.848 --> 57:39.475
Have you sent specimens
to Washington?

57:39.600 --> 57:42.394
We sent specimens off to Washington
but it's gonna be quite a wait.

57:42.520 --> 57:45.523
- You know how they are.
- Yeah. Well, at least that's something.

57:45.648 --> 57:47.149
We'll just have to wait.

57:47.274 --> 57:51.070
Oh, and another thing: there's a reporter
on her way up here, a woman reporter.

57:51.195 --> 57:52.738
If she happens to nail you in the hall,

57:52.863 --> 57:55.491
don't say anything to her at all
about those glasses.

57:55.616 --> 57:58.035
If she writes about them
that will alert the killer.

57:58.160 --> 58:02.248
If you see her, just smile,
say hello and keep on moving.

58:02.373 --> 58:04.041
OK, Captain.

58:04.166 --> 58:06.168
I'll leave the show to you.

58:19.515 --> 58:23.060
Hi, Captain Shaw? Remember me?
Lydia Welles of the "Star Journal".

58:23.185 --> 58:26.605
Of course I remember you.
The, uh... Byfield-McShane case, right?

58:26.730 --> 58:30.734
Right. The feuding mountain boys
finally had their final feud.

58:30.859 --> 58:33.320
Yeah, it was a pretty messy affair.
Sit down, please.

58:33.445 --> 58:34.446
Thank you.

58:35.656 --> 58:39.577
The Byfield-McShane case was bad
but this one seems to be a lot worse.

58:39.702 --> 58:42.705
A lot worse.
We have a lot less to go on.

58:42.830 --> 58:46.625
I guess you could say the nature
of this town is responsible for that.

58:46.750 --> 58:47.918
The nature of this town?

58:49.211 --> 58:50.588
All roads may lead to Rome

58:50.713 --> 58:52.965
but they seem
to run through Crescent City,

58:53.090 --> 58:55.175
meaning we have
ten times as many hitchhikers

58:55.301 --> 58:56.719
as any other town this size.

58:57.428 --> 59:00.639
Oh, I see. I guess,
as Mayor Langford says,

59:00.764 --> 59:03.309
"Crescent City is the hub
of highways to everywhere."

59:03.434 --> 59:06.478
With the result
that hitchhikers are here in droves.

59:06.604 --> 59:09.315
You see, most homicides occur
between members of a family

59:09.440 --> 59:10.774
or between rival gangs

59:10.899 --> 59:13.736
or during the commission
of another crime,

59:13.861 --> 59:17.698
where the guilty party is at least known
or easy to track down.

59:17.823 --> 59:20.451
But this is an entirely different case.

59:20.576 --> 59:24.580
Here there's no prior relationship
between the killer and his victim,

59:24.705 --> 59:27.958
just random rape and murder
with no motive to hunt for.

59:28.083 --> 59:31.086
Have you drawn any kind of profile
on this rapist killer?

59:31.211 --> 59:35.549
As much as we can, but there have been
no witnesses at all to these crimes.

59:35.674 --> 59:38.260
About all we can say
is that he's a psychopathic case.

59:39.386 --> 59:41.889
I doubt if he even knows
what he's doing.

59:42.014 --> 59:44.767
You be sure and say hello
to your mom now.

59:44.892 --> 59:46.602
- Thank you, Rosie.
- See ya.

59:47.811 --> 59:49.730
(Telephone ringing)

59:55.069 --> 59:56.862
Baldwin Cleaners.

59:56.987 --> 01:00:00.240
Oh, yes, Mrs Jeffries.
How are you? Nice to...

01:00:01.033 --> 01:00:02.618
Oh, he hasn't, huh?

01:00:03.661 --> 01:00:04.662
Hm?

01:00:04.787 --> 01:00:08.666
Oh, well, I'm sure
he'll be there pretty quickly...

01:00:08.791 --> 01:00:10.459
Yes. Well, sometimes they get...

01:00:11.752 --> 01:00:13.754
Yes, Mrs Jeffries.
Yes, well, if...

01:00:13.879 --> 01:00:17.091
If you just be patient a little bit,
I'm sure he'll be there any minute now.

01:00:17.216 --> 01:00:19.635
And thank you very much
for letting me know and calling me.

01:00:19.760 --> 01:00:20.761
Thank you.

01:00:35.192 --> 01:00:37.194
One final question, Captain Shaw.

01:00:37.319 --> 01:00:39.571
What are your chances
of finding this psychopath?

01:00:39.697 --> 01:00:43.200
100%.
Oh, he'll be caught, all right.

01:00:43.325 --> 01:00:45.744
The question is when.

01:00:47.287 --> 01:00:49.039
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

01:00:49.164 --> 01:00:50.999
- It's nice seeing you again.
- Good.

01:00:53.001 --> 01:00:54.420
OK, thank you.

01:01:03.470 --> 01:01:05.013
What did you tell the lady?

01:01:05.139 --> 01:01:07.307
Buy the "Star Journal"
and read all about it.

01:01:08.517 --> 01:01:10.853
- What's that?
- Fingerprint report from Washington.

01:01:10.978 --> 01:01:14.732
Came in a little sooner than I thought.
But negative, I'm afraid.

01:01:14.857 --> 01:01:15.899
Negative, huh?

01:01:16.024 --> 01:01:20.028
Well, it means our nut
hasn't been in any trouble until now.

01:01:20.154 --> 01:01:22.072
(Telephone ringing)

01:01:24.783 --> 01:01:25.784
Yeah?

01:01:29.163 --> 01:01:30.164
Where?

01:01:34.543 --> 01:01:36.295
All right, we'll meet you there.

01:01:41.175 --> 01:01:44.762
Another victim.
And this time, it's a boy.

01:01:44.887 --> 01:01:49.558
A boy? Then maybe
our nut didn't do this one.

01:01:49.683 --> 01:01:52.603
He's got a wire coat hanger
wrapped around his neck.

01:02:08.535 --> 01:02:10.454
(Door opening and closing)

01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:13.874
Oh, I'm sorry I'm late,
Mr Baldwin.

01:02:13.999 --> 01:02:15.542
Well, what is it this time?

01:02:15.667 --> 01:02:17.377
I-I-I had a flat tire.

01:02:17.503 --> 01:02:21.924
Oh, so this time it's a flat tire.
How long can it take you to fix a flat?

01:02:22.674 --> 01:02:26.303
Uh... well, I had to, uh...
The spare was flat too.

01:02:26.428 --> 01:02:28.514
I-I-I had to wheel it a long way
to a gas station.

01:02:28.639 --> 01:02:32.351
Wait, it wasn't flat the other day
when I ran your route.

01:02:32.476 --> 01:02:35.562
- It wasn't?
- No, it wasn't. I checked it.

01:02:35.687 --> 01:02:37.314
How could it go flat so soon?

01:02:38.357 --> 01:02:40.567
Well, it's... it's possible, isn't it?

01:02:41.735 --> 01:02:43.278
Well, I suppose it is.

01:02:44.363 --> 01:02:47.658
But that's not the real problem, Howard.
The real problem is you.

01:02:47.783 --> 01:02:51.119
You're falling down on the job.
I try to forget about your mistakes

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:53.705
and coming in late,
but I've got a business to run here.

01:02:53.831 --> 01:02:55.666
Now, come on, what's the problem?

01:02:55.791 --> 01:02:58.168
I don't know, Mr Baldwin!
I just had a string of bad luck.

01:02:58.293 --> 01:03:00.546
I mean, everything's gone bad
for me this week.

01:03:00.671 --> 01:03:04.633
All right. Let's hope
you don't have any more bad luck.

01:03:04.758 --> 01:03:07.094
Because, uh...
starting tomorrow, Howard,

01:03:07.219 --> 01:03:11.056
if you don't improve,
I'm gonna have to let you go.

01:03:11.181 --> 01:03:12.516
Do you understand, Howard?

01:03:14.685 --> 01:03:17.354
Howard, do you understand?
I've gotta let you go.

01:03:17.479 --> 01:03:19.231
Yes, Mr Baldwin, I understand.

01:03:20.607 --> 01:03:22.860
A real psycho had to do this.

01:03:22.985 --> 01:03:25.904
A real first-class psycho.

01:03:26.029 --> 01:03:28.407
(Davis) And now boys as well as girls.

01:03:29.199 --> 01:03:31.952
I guess any kid
who runs away qualifies.

01:03:32.077 --> 01:03:33.912
I guess so.

01:03:34.037 --> 01:03:37.124
You know, there's another thing
that's got me stumped.

01:03:37.249 --> 01:03:42.421
One coat hanger, that's unusual.
Two coat hangers is not a coincidence.

01:03:42.546 --> 01:03:45.382
Now, who drives around
with coat hangers?

01:03:45.507 --> 01:03:47.092
Salesmen?

01:03:47.217 --> 01:03:49.469
Could he be a traveling salesman?

01:03:49.595 --> 01:03:51.972
Could be, or a delivery man
or something.

01:03:52.097 --> 01:03:54.016
Yeah, whatever.

01:03:55.809 --> 01:03:58.645
Hey, you better get on home.
It's later than hell.

01:03:58.770 --> 01:04:01.899
Your wife will be blaming me
for breaking up your marriage.

01:04:05.110 --> 01:04:07.779
I declare, Howie,
you're eating like a bird these days.

01:04:07.905 --> 01:04:09.656
I don't suppose
you want any dessert either.

01:04:09.781 --> 01:04:11.533
- No, Mama.
- (Tuts)

01:04:15.621 --> 01:04:17.039
Mama?

01:04:19.917 --> 01:04:22.002
Mr Baldwin is gonna fire me.

01:04:23.879 --> 01:04:25.005
What?

01:04:26.465 --> 01:04:28.091
He's gonna fire me.

01:04:28.216 --> 01:04:31.136
Well, what in the world for?

01:04:32.679 --> 01:04:35.057
He says I'm falling down
on the job.

01:04:36.183 --> 01:04:38.143
Well, that is just plain ridiculous.

01:04:38.268 --> 01:04:39.895
I know it is.

01:04:40.479 --> 01:04:44.149
You've been there six years.
Why, you're the best boy he ever had.

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:46.860
I know it.

01:04:46.985 --> 01:04:49.279
Is it because you were sick
the other day?

01:04:50.906 --> 01:04:52.699
- I don't know.
- Well, my goodness,

01:04:52.824 --> 01:04:54.326
if you're sick, you're sick.

01:04:54.451 --> 01:04:57.079
After six years you can certainly
be sick once in a while.

01:04:58.163 --> 01:05:01.166
And he's not given you a raise neither,
not in six years.

01:05:01.291 --> 01:05:04.711
I'm gonna call that Mr Baldwin
and give him a piece of my mind.

01:05:18.350 --> 01:05:20.477
- How you doing, honey?
- Hi, babe.

01:05:21.979 --> 01:05:23.814
Another rough one, sweet?

01:05:23.939 --> 01:05:25.482
Kinda rough, yeah.

01:05:27.651 --> 01:05:30.946
Aren't you gonna eat first?
I've been keeping your dinner.

01:05:32.406 --> 01:05:33.782
I gotta unwind a little.

01:05:39.913 --> 01:05:41.832
You must have had a rough day.

01:05:43.250 --> 01:05:45.919
This case is driving me crazy.

01:05:46.044 --> 01:05:50.799
Well, I guess I better tell you the news
while you're still in condition to hear it.

01:05:50.924 --> 01:05:52.759
What news?

01:05:52.884 --> 01:05:54.344
I went to the doctor today.

01:05:55.595 --> 01:05:57.014
You went to the doctor?

01:05:58.598 --> 01:06:00.017
What's the matter?

01:06:02.060 --> 01:06:04.479
I'm sure glad we're married, sweet.

01:06:04.604 --> 01:06:07.357
I'd hate to be
one of those unwed mothers.

01:06:08.692 --> 01:06:10.193
You're going to have a baby?

01:06:14.489 --> 01:06:15.657
Yes.

01:06:16.575 --> 01:06:17.909
Yes, I am.

01:06:22.622 --> 01:06:24.207
(Sighs)

01:07:07.125 --> 01:07:08.877
I'm sorry, Evelyn.

01:07:09.878 --> 01:07:11.713
I don't know what got into me.

01:07:11.838 --> 01:07:13.590
I'm sorry.

01:07:14.800 --> 01:07:16.718
Are you gonna forgive me, or not?

01:07:18.386 --> 01:07:20.722
It isn't a matter of forgiving you.

01:07:20.847 --> 01:07:23.767
I just don't understand
why you reacted like you did.

01:07:24.684 --> 01:07:28.772
Isn't having a baby
a natural and normal thing?

01:07:28.897 --> 01:07:30.315
Yes, of course.

01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:33.068
And we've been looking forward to it,
haven't we?

01:07:33.985 --> 01:07:35.195
Yes, we have.

01:07:36.822 --> 01:07:39.241
Then why did you act like that?

01:07:40.784 --> 01:07:44.788
Because, well, I was thinking
that bringing a baby into this world

01:07:44.913 --> 01:07:47.541
might not be such a good idea.

01:07:47.666 --> 01:07:49.376
I mean, look at all that's going on.

01:07:49.501 --> 01:07:51.670
Rape, murder,

01:07:51.795 --> 01:07:55.590
drug addiction,
war, poverty, all that.

01:07:55.715 --> 01:07:58.969
I mean, who wants a child
to face such things?

01:07:59.094 --> 01:08:00.095
Nobody.

01:08:01.721 --> 01:08:04.057
But we all have to face such things.

01:08:06.518 --> 01:08:08.979
Don't you know
we have to take our chances?

01:08:10.564 --> 01:08:13.066
Don't you know
we've always had to take our chances

01:08:13.191 --> 01:08:15.068
and we'll have to keep on taking them?

01:08:16.778 --> 01:08:20.907
And just try to somehow
make things better.

01:08:22.325 --> 01:08:23.952
Don't you know that?

01:08:24.953 --> 01:08:26.662
Yeah, I guess I know that.

01:08:28.038 --> 01:08:29.541
It's just this case I'm working on.

01:08:29.666 --> 01:08:33.587
This... this nut
who's still running around loose.

01:08:33.712 --> 01:08:36.715
I don't know,
it's got me thinking crazy.

01:08:36.840 --> 01:08:37.841
I know.

01:08:39.718 --> 01:08:41.136
I know how you feel.

01:08:43.513 --> 01:08:45.390
But don't let it come between us.

01:08:46.975 --> 01:08:47.975
Huh?

01:08:51.520 --> 01:08:54.441
Norma? Norma!

01:08:54.566 --> 01:08:57.777
- What are you yelling about?
- You call tomorrow and cancel that.

01:08:57.903 --> 01:09:01.156
- I've already given him a deposit.
- Get the deposit back.

01:09:01.281 --> 01:09:06.036
I can't. Anyway, why should I?
We need a new rug, don't we?

01:09:06.161 --> 01:09:08.580
(Mr Burke) I thought we agreed
neither of us would buy anything

01:09:08.705 --> 01:09:10.207
without the other's OK.

01:09:10.332 --> 01:09:12.334
(Mrs Burke) And I thought
we agreed we'd save money

01:09:12.459 --> 01:09:14.419
wherever we could.

01:09:14.544 --> 01:09:17.881
This was a bargain
I couldn't pass up: 50% off.

01:09:18.006 --> 01:09:20.341
Now, you tell me
if that isn't a bargain?

01:09:20.466 --> 01:09:23.386
50% off? Do you believe
everything the salesman tells you?

01:09:23.511 --> 01:09:27.974
50% off what? A price that is already
200% higher than in should be?

01:09:28.099 --> 01:09:31.269
Won't you stop it?
Please, stop fighting.

01:09:32.938 --> 01:09:35.899
It's all right, Lisa.
Now, let's go back to bed.

01:09:42.238 --> 01:09:44.241
Why are you and Daddy
always fighting?

01:09:44.366 --> 01:09:46.785
We didn't realize
that you were awake, Lisa.

01:09:46.910 --> 01:09:48.745
Now, let's go back to sleep.

01:09:48.870 --> 01:09:50.956
You won't fight anymore, will you?

01:09:51.081 --> 01:09:54.084
No, no more, darling.
Good night.

01:10:03.969 --> 01:10:06.846
- You see what happened?
- Yeah, it's all my fault, huh?

01:10:06.972 --> 01:10:10.100
Well, isn't it? You're the one
who started yelling.

01:10:10.225 --> 01:10:13.228
I don't think I started yelling
until you started yelling.

01:10:13.353 --> 01:10:16.690
Well, your memory certainly isn't
one of your stronger points.

01:10:16.815 --> 01:10:20.235
You started yelling at me
the minute you found that sales slip.

01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:23.280
And you knew very well
that Lisa was in the next room.

01:10:23.405 --> 01:10:27.158
I didn't start yelling, I just asked you
what the hell this was about.

01:10:27.284 --> 01:10:31.204
- But I wasn't yelling.
- You're yelling right now!

01:11:25.050 --> 01:11:27.510
Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:11:28.678 --> 01:11:30.263
Oh, my God.

01:11:30.388 --> 01:11:33.141
Mama! Mama! Mama!

01:11:33.266 --> 01:11:34.267
Help me!

01:11:42.359 --> 01:11:43.610
There, there.

01:11:43.735 --> 01:11:44.944
OK, there.

01:11:45.070 --> 01:11:47.197
All right, there.

01:11:47.322 --> 01:11:50.241
There, Howie.
There, there, there, there.

01:11:55.955 --> 01:11:59.042
- Morning, Mr Baldwin.
- Good morning.

01:11:59.167 --> 01:12:01.169
Your mother phoned me
at home last night.

01:12:01.294 --> 01:12:02.837
Did you know that?

01:12:04.255 --> 01:12:05.507
Yes, sir.

01:12:05.632 --> 01:12:07.425
I was having my supper.

01:12:10.345 --> 01:12:11.930
I'm sorry, Mr Baldwin.

01:12:12.055 --> 01:12:15.767
Yes, well, please ask your mother
not to phone me at home

01:12:15.892 --> 01:12:17.227
unless it's an emergency.

01:12:18.228 --> 01:12:19.229
All right, sir.

01:12:21.398 --> 01:12:22.982
Is your truck loaded?

01:12:23.650 --> 01:12:25.402
No, not yet, Mr Baldwin.

01:12:27.654 --> 01:12:29.906
- Mr Baldwin?
- Hm?

01:12:30.907 --> 01:12:32.575
(Howard) Am I fired?

01:12:36.579 --> 01:12:41.167
Well, we'll...
we'll see how you do today.

01:12:41.292 --> 01:12:43.044
Now, go load your truck.

01:12:44.254 --> 01:12:46.005
All right, Mr Baldwin.

01:12:55.014 --> 01:12:56.891
- I need this in a hurry, Jackie.
- Yes, sir.

01:12:57.016 --> 01:12:59.227
Captain Shaw, I just got a call
from the front desk.

01:12:59.352 --> 01:13:01.855
There's a lady on the way in.
I think you oughta talk to her.

01:13:01.980 --> 01:13:04.065
Bill, I gotta get this communique out
this morning.

01:13:04.190 --> 01:13:07.694
She's pretty upset.
Her little girl ran away from home.

01:13:09.112 --> 01:13:11.448
All right, I'll see her in a few minutes.
Bring her in the office.

01:13:11.573 --> 01:13:13.825
- Get on that, will you, Jackie?
- Yes, sir.

01:13:38.892 --> 01:13:40.393
Captain Shaw, Mrs Burke.

01:13:41.436 --> 01:13:44.272
Captain Shaw, it's Lisa.
It's my little girl.

01:13:44.397 --> 01:13:46.649
She's run away from home.
You've got to do something.

01:13:46.774 --> 01:13:49.527
All right, Mrs Burke.
Please, sit down.

01:13:49.652 --> 01:13:53.740
That's it. Now, first of all,
your little girl's name is Lisa?

01:13:54.866 --> 01:13:58.703
Yes, Lisa Burke.
She's just 11 years old.

01:13:59.370 --> 01:14:01.122
Are you sure she's run away?

01:14:01.789 --> 01:14:05.960
Yes, I'm sure. I came home
about an hour ago and I found this note.

01:14:07.504 --> 01:14:11.299
I'll read it because you probably won't
be able to make out her writing anyway.

01:14:12.217 --> 01:14:15.303
"Dear Mama, I'm running away.

01:14:15.428 --> 01:14:16.721
"You and Dad...

01:14:18.097 --> 01:14:20.934
"You and Daddy always fight
and I can't stand it anymore.

01:14:21.726 --> 01:14:23.728
"I'm going to live with Grandma.

01:14:23.853 --> 01:14:25.522
"Your daughter, Lisa."

01:14:25.647 --> 01:14:27.398
Grandma? Is that your mother?

01:14:27.982 --> 01:14:32.028
- Yes, she lives in Jackson Wells.
- Did you call her?

01:14:32.153 --> 01:14:35.114
Yes, I've called her every few minutes
but no one answers.

01:14:35.240 --> 01:14:37.617
She must be out somewhere.

01:14:37.742 --> 01:14:40.370
Jackson Wells.
That's out on Highway 24, isn't it?

01:14:42.497 --> 01:14:45.250
All right, I'll dispatch every available car
out in that direction.

01:14:45.375 --> 01:14:46.793
We'll see if we can spot her.

01:14:46.918 --> 01:14:49.379
You give me her exact description,
what she was wearing.

01:14:50.255 --> 01:14:52.882
Well, as I told you,
she's 11 years old.

01:14:53.007 --> 01:14:56.970
She's 4 feet, 8 inches tall.
She weighs about 80 pounds.

01:14:58.763 --> 01:15:01.182
'She's got brown eyes
and blonde hair and...

01:15:01.307 --> 01:15:03.142
'and she's wearing
a football-type shirt,

01:15:03.268 --> 01:15:05.895
'red, white and blue
with the number 66 on it.

01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:09.315
'She's got blue shoes on
and white socks and...

01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:13.695
'Oh, she's probably carrying a suitcase
that's much too big for her.'

01:15:16.155 --> 01:15:18.658
(Howard hoots horn)

01:15:21.744 --> 01:15:24.497
- Are you gonna give me a ride?
- Oh, sure.

01:15:26.416 --> 01:15:27.667
(Howard grunts)

01:15:27.792 --> 01:15:29.127
(Lisa) Thank you.

01:15:30.169 --> 01:15:33.548
I wasn't hitchhiking, you know?
I know I'm not allowed to do that.

01:15:33.673 --> 01:15:35.758
But I'm sure glad you stopped for me.

01:15:35.883 --> 01:15:39.178
Boy, that's sure a heavy suitcase
for a little girl like you.

01:15:39.929 --> 01:15:43.182
I know it. I don't think
I could have carried it much further.

01:15:44.434 --> 01:15:46.644
Where are you going
with such a heavy suitcase?

01:15:46.769 --> 01:15:49.981
To Jackson Wells.
That's where my grandmother lives.

01:15:50.106 --> 01:15:54.068
Jackson Wells?
You're going the wrong way.

01:15:54.193 --> 01:15:56.070
I am?

01:15:57.113 --> 01:16:01.200
Yeah, yeah. Jackson Wells is...
is that way back through town.

01:16:01.993 --> 01:16:05.121
Oh, no!
I'm on the wrong road.

01:16:06.122 --> 01:16:08.291
You're not on the wrong road,
you're on the right road.

01:16:08.416 --> 01:16:10.835
You're just headed
the wrong direction, that's all.

01:16:10.960 --> 01:16:12.712
Don't you know
north from south yet?

01:16:13.421 --> 01:16:15.632
I got turned around, I guess.

01:16:15.757 --> 01:16:18.009
Oh, you sure did.
Well, listen, that's OK.

01:16:18.134 --> 01:16:21.554
I got a delivery to make up here
and then I'm coming back through town

01:16:21.679 --> 01:16:23.598
so you can come along if you like.

01:16:23.723 --> 01:16:25.642
(Lisa) Oh, good.

01:16:43.660 --> 01:16:47.330
OK, right.
Good, Harry. Thank you.

01:16:47.455 --> 01:16:48.956
They're on their way out there,
Mrs Burke.

01:16:50.083 --> 01:16:52.919
- I hope they get there soon.
- They will.

01:16:54.128 --> 01:16:56.631
- I feel better already.
- Good.

01:17:51.936 --> 01:17:54.439
Lieutenant Davis will take you
to the waiting room, Mrs Burke.

01:17:54.564 --> 01:17:56.816
You'll let me know the minute
you pick her up, won't you?

01:17:56.941 --> 01:17:59.610
- Of course we'll let you know.
- Thank you, Captain.

01:18:09.495 --> 01:18:10.621
(Sighs)

01:18:34.228 --> 01:18:36.230
We're going the right way now,
aren't we?

01:18:36.355 --> 01:18:39.525
Huh? Oh, yeah, yeah.
We're going the right way.

01:18:39.650 --> 01:18:42.487
Listen, I won't be able to take you
all the way to Jackson Wells, though.

01:18:42.612 --> 01:18:44.697
I have to drop you off in town.

01:18:44.822 --> 01:18:48.576
Oh, that's OK. Just as long
as I'm heading in the right direction.

01:18:49.827 --> 01:18:52.371
I love this truck.
Is it yours?

01:18:52.497 --> 01:18:55.249
- No.
- I wish it was mine.

01:18:58.294 --> 01:19:01.130
Here. You can have this one.

01:19:01.255 --> 01:19:04.008
- Oh, thank you.
- I made it myself.

01:19:04.133 --> 01:19:06.886
You did? Oh, I love it.

01:19:07.011 --> 01:19:09.055
I'll keep it always.

01:19:11.808 --> 01:19:13.643
Did you see
that billy goat back there?

01:19:13.768 --> 01:19:16.521
Huh? What... what billy goat?

01:19:17.230 --> 01:19:20.399
I guess you didn't.
I guess you were still in the house.

01:19:20.525 --> 01:19:23.861
A billy goat came out of the yard,
went across the road

01:19:23.986 --> 01:19:27.156
and went way off into a field.
I guess it's running away like me.

01:19:28.491 --> 01:19:29.742
Running away?

01:19:30.618 --> 01:19:34.789
I thought... you were going
to see your grandmother.

01:19:34.914 --> 01:19:37.500
No, I'm running away from home.

01:20:02.233 --> 01:20:05.319
I stayed with her a while.
I guess she'll be all right.

01:20:06.195 --> 01:20:07.947
I really feel for her.

01:20:09.240 --> 01:20:10.783
That makes two of us.

01:20:11.701 --> 01:20:13.411
You don't think that...

01:20:13.536 --> 01:20:16.038
...well, if that nut does pick up
that little girl,

01:20:16.163 --> 01:20:17.915
he'll do anything to her, do you?

01:20:18.875 --> 01:20:20.459
I mean, a little girl like that?

01:20:20.585 --> 01:20:24.755
I may be a dreamer but I, uh...
I don't think he'd touch a kid that age.

01:20:24.881 --> 01:20:27.383
(Telephone ringing)

01:20:27.508 --> 01:20:28.509
Yeah?

01:20:45.401 --> 01:20:46.736
We were wrong.

01:20:47.904 --> 01:20:48.905
(Sighs)

01:20:50.865 --> 01:20:52.950
You better bring in Mrs Burke.

01:20:56.621 --> 01:20:57.955
Well, what should I tell her?

01:20:58.080 --> 01:21:01.918
Don't tell her anything.
I-I'm not sure it's her little girl.

01:21:02.043 --> 01:21:03.961
Oh, but she'd better
come along with us.

01:21:16.015 --> 01:21:17.600
Did they pick up Lisa, Captain?

01:21:17.725 --> 01:21:21.228
I don't know, Mrs Burke,
but we'd like you to come along with us.

01:21:21.354 --> 01:21:24.982
Is something wrong?
Did something happen to Lisa?

01:21:25.107 --> 01:21:26.859
Tell me!

01:21:26.984 --> 01:21:28.319
I don't know.

01:21:28.444 --> 01:21:30.905
Now, please, Mrs Burke,
try to calm down.

01:21:55.096 --> 01:21:58.015
Lieutenant, would you ride
in the back with Mrs Burke?

01:22:14.365 --> 01:22:16.534
(Siren wailing)

01:23:13.257 --> 01:23:15.176
Stay here with Mrs Burke.

01:23:18.804 --> 01:23:20.222
(All talk at once)

01:23:20.347 --> 01:23:22.183
Out of the way.
Come on, get out of there.

01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.852
Please, lady, step aside.

01:23:55.382 --> 01:23:58.135
(Screaming)

01:24:06.560 --> 01:24:08.896
No! Lisa!

01:24:19.949 --> 01:24:22.451
No! No!

01:24:22.576 --> 01:24:25.579
My God! My Lisa!

01:24:25.704 --> 01:24:27.206
Oh, my God!

01:24:38.425 --> 01:24:40.511
Oh, my God!

01:24:54.191 --> 01:24:56.110
(Vehicle approaching)

01:25:21.093 --> 01:25:24.430
(Door opens and closes)

01:25:48.245 --> 01:25:51.165
(Howard) What are you both
looking at me like that for?

01:26:19.401 --> 01:26:20.819
Mama?

01:26:28.202 --> 01:26:29.620
Mama?

01:26:33.123 --> 01:26:35.042
Where are you, Mama?

01:26:42.132 --> 01:26:45.052
I'm so... cold.

01:26:46.929 --> 01:26:48.347
Mama!

01:26:50.474 --> 01:26:53.644
Mama, I'm so cold!
