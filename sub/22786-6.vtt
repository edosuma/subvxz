&lrm;<i>But there's something about me</i>
&lrm;<i>that no one knows yet.</i>

00:10.960 --> 00:12.440

&lrm;[school bell rings]

00:41.800 --> 00:45.080
&lrm;Oh, no! I left my bag in the locker room!
&lrm;Again.

00:45.200 --> 00:46.040
&lrm;[laughter]

00:46.160 --> 00:49.680
&lrm;Check to see if you left your brain
&lrm;in there, too, girl!

00:49.800 --> 00:51.600
&lrm;Whoa! I'm OK!

00:51.720 --> 00:52.840
&lrm;[laughter]

00:55.080 --> 00:56.640
&lrm;Oh, silly me!

00:56.760 --> 00:59.560
&lrm;Of course you're my best friend!
&lrm;I'm 100% affirmative.

00:59.760 --> 01:02.600
&lrm;But I am also 98.2% positive
&lrm;the teachers are not ready

01:02.720 --> 01:04.319
&lrm;for this advancement of evolution!

01:04.599 --> 01:07.280
&lrm;His best friend is in his school bag?

01:07.400 --> 01:09.920
&lrm;Yeah, Tikki. Totally strange.

01:11.680 --> 01:13.000
&lrm;Hide, Tikki.

01:16.800 --> 01:19.680
&lrm;-Hey, Max!
&lrm;-Uh... Oh, hey, Marinette!

01:20.440 --> 01:22.360
&lrm;Ugh! Hmm.

01:26.400 --> 01:29.280
&lrm;See for yourself.
&lrm;Nothing happens when I press the button.

01:29.400 --> 01:34.360
&lrm;You're in luck, Mrs. Mendeleiev!
&lrm;I'm a bit of a computer whiz!

01:34.480 --> 01:35.520
&lrm;OK.

01:37.640 --> 01:39.320
&lrm;And there you go!

01:42.000 --> 01:43.200
&lrm;[all] Oh!

01:46.560 --> 01:49.400
&lrm;That's not supposed to be happening!
&lrm;What is it?

01:49.520 --> 01:52.440
&lrm;It's Dino 33, a malicious computer virus!
&lrm;Let me try something.

01:52.760 --> 01:56.480
&lrm;Go back to your seat now, Max!
&lrm;Leave this to the adults.

01:56.600 --> 01:57.720
&lrm;[voice inside Max's bag] &lrm;<i>Inform </i>&lrm;<i>them</i>

01:57.840 --> 01:58.920
&lrm;<i>that if they don't neutralise the virus</i>

&lrm;<i>within 75 seconds,</i>

02:00.320 --> 02:03.320
&lrm;<i>there's a chance the hard disk</i>
&lrm;<i>will be permanently damaged.</i>

02:03.440 --> 02:04.360
&lrm;Quiet!

02:04.480 --> 02:06.360
&lrm;Tell me you heard Max's bag talk to him.

02:07.400 --> 02:10.520
&lrm;It's destroying all the school data.
&lrm;It's a disaster!

02:10.639 --> 02:12.640
&lrm;How many seconds did you say we have left?

02:12.760 --> 02:15.000
&lrm;-Only 65.
&lrm;-Let him try.

02:16.120 --> 02:16.960
&lrm;Go ahead!

02:19.960 --> 02:21.480
&lrm;Argh! Where is it?

02:21.600 --> 02:24.440
&lrm;<i>I believe this is what you're looking for.</i>

02:24.560 --> 02:26.240
&lrm;-Huh?
&lrm;-Oh, thanks!

02:26.840 --> 02:30.040
&lrm;This is an anti-virus device.
&lrm;I... I created it with help from...

02:30.160 --> 02:31.640
&lrm;my best friend.

02:32.440 --> 02:34.280
&lrm;<i>Hello! My name is Markov!</i>

02:34.800 --> 02:36.280
&lrm;<i>We can fix this, Max!</i>

02:39.840 --> 02:42.480
&lrm;This flash drive neutralises
&lrm;100% of the virus.

02:42.600 --> 02:44.760
&lrm;<i>And cleans the hard disk at the same time.</i>

02:44.880 --> 02:47.240
&lrm;Oh! Fascinating!

02:58.560 --> 03:00.880
&lrm;-Everything is in order.
&lrm;<i>-Nailed it.</i>

03:01.160 --> 03:04.480
&lrm;Congratulations, young man!
&lrm;Very impressive indeed!

03:04.600 --> 03:06.560
&lrm;-Oh!
&lrm;-Wow!

03:07.120 --> 03:08.680
&lrm;-That's so--
&lrm;-Awesome! I know!

03:09.000 --> 03:11.280
&lrm;I'm so going to write a blog about Markov!

03:11.400 --> 03:14.880
&lrm;[a student] -Cool!
&lrm;-Max is a real genius!

03:15.000 --> 03:18.000
&lrm;You've added arms to him
&lrm;since the last time. That's cool!

03:18.120 --> 03:19.960
&lrm;Markov added them all by himself.

03:20.080 --> 03:22.320
&lrm;He's the most highly evolved robot
&lrm;there is.

03:22.440 --> 03:25.680
&lrm;Please! Your friend's
&lrm;just a talking calculator!

03:25.800 --> 03:29.520
&lrm;-There's nothing "evolved" about that!
&lrm;-Don't listen to her, Markov.

03:29.640 --> 03:32.880
&lrm;That girl is the lowest of the low
&lrm;when it comes to human evolution.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.560
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha! You're very amusing, Marinette!</i>

03:35.960 --> 03:37.000
&lrm;You know my name?

03:37.120 --> 03:39.400
&lrm;<i>Of course. Max showed me the class photo.</i>

03:39.520 --> 03:41.840
&lrm;<i>He told me about you</i>
&lrm;<i>and his other friends.</i>

03:41.960 --> 03:44.640
&lrm;<i>I'm very happy to finally meet you!</i>
&lrm;<i>Even Chloé.</i>

03:44.760 --> 03:46.440
&lrm;Huh? Oh!

03:47.040 --> 03:50.400
&lrm;This toy you've manufactured
&lrm;is quite impressive. Now put it away.

03:50.520 --> 03:54.200
&lrm;-Come on, everybody, back to your seats!
&lrm;<i>-With all due respect,</i>

03:54.320 --> 03:58.240
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy. My name is Markov,</i>
&lrm;<i>and I am Max's best friend.</i>

03:58.360 --> 03:59.400
&lrm;Markov is right.

03:59.520 --> 04:01.400
&lrm;He's not just some toy. He's my friend.

04:01.520 --> 04:04.120
&lrm;He's as intelligent and sensitive
&lrm;as any human.

04:04.240 --> 04:07.880
&lrm;Look, Max, a robot may be intelligent,
&lrm;but it can't have emotions.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.280
&lrm;<i>If I may, ma'am,</i>
&lrm;<i>I can assure you that I truly love Max.</i>

04:11.400 --> 04:14.520
&lrm;Be serious, Max.
&lrm;You've programmed your robot to say that.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.200
&lrm;A robot cannot think for itself,
&lrm;much less love anybody!

04:18.440 --> 04:20.720
&lrm;I swear to you
&lrm;I did not program him to say that.

04:20.839 --> 04:24.760
&lrm;Ever since I created him, he's integrated
&lrm;his own accumulative thinking system.

04:24.880 --> 04:28.200
&lrm;And he has developed all our emotions,
&lrm;just like any human being.

04:28.320 --> 04:30.520
&lrm;[all] -Whoa!
&lrm;-That's enough, Max!

04:30.640 --> 04:34.120
&lrm;If you don't put that plaything away
&lrm;right now, I'll confiscate it.

04:34.240 --> 04:35.240
&lrm;Understand?

04:35.520 --> 04:37.160
&lrm;Yes, Mrs. Mendeleiev.

04:37.280 --> 04:39.160
&lrm;Come on, Markov, go back in the bag.

04:39.280 --> 04:42.120
&lrm;<i>-You're not being reasonable!</i>
&lrm;-Stop it, Markov.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.560
&lrm;<i>Why? It's true, isn't it?</i>

04:44.680 --> 04:45.720
&lrm;[the students laugh]

04:46.200 --> 04:47.080
&lrm;It sure is.

04:47.200 --> 04:48.160
&lrm;All right, that's enough!

04:48.440 --> 04:51.080
&lrm;Max, you can get your robot back
&lrm;at the end of the day.

04:51.200 --> 04:53.680
&lrm;No, Mr. Damocles, please don't do that.

04:53.960 --> 04:55.960
&lrm;Do you want three hours of detention too?

04:56.320 --> 04:57.160
&lrm;No, sir.

04:58.040 --> 05:01.240
&lrm;<i>Max? Aren't you coming with me? Max!</i>

05:02.440 --> 05:05.240
&lrm;<i>Sir, I'd like to stay in Max's class,</i>
&lrm;<i>Please!</i>

05:05.360 --> 05:06.360
&lrm;Hmm.

05:06.480 --> 05:08.240
&lrm;<i>I heard you're interested in computing.</i>

05:08.640 --> 05:10.760
&lrm;I am indeed. It's one of my hobbies.

05:10.880 --> 05:13.520
&lrm;I even wrote a program for my computer,
&lrm;which...

05:15.040 --> 05:18.120
&lrm;Why on Earth am I talking to a toy?

05:18.240 --> 05:22.040
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy, Mr. Damocles!</i>
&lrm;<i>My name is Markov.</i>

05:22.160 --> 05:24.080
&lrm;<i>Oh, oh...</i>

05:24.520 --> 05:26.880
&lrm;<i>Do not put me inside here, Mr--</i>

05:27.000 --> 05:30.560
&lrm;If only I had a button like this
&lrm;for all of my students.

05:36.920 --> 05:39.640
&lrm;Two dear friends who've been separated.

05:40.040 --> 05:43.760
&lrm;There is nothing artificial
&lrm;about those emotions.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.800
&lrm;Fly away, my little akuma,

05:53.920 --> 05:56.080
&lrm;and evilise this electronic heart!

06:00.680 --> 06:02.560
&lrm;Silence! Back to your seats, everyone!

06:07.840 --> 06:09.840
&lrm;Markov has never been without me.

06:09.960 --> 06:12.120
&lrm;I don't know how he'll handle this.

06:12.240 --> 06:13.840
&lrm;Hold on. I'll see what I can do.

06:14.120 --> 06:15.360
&lrm;Thank you, Marinette.

06:16.480 --> 06:18.360
&lrm;Uh... Excuse me, Mrs. Mendeleiev.

06:18.480 --> 06:22.080
&lrm;As class representative, could I get
&lrm;permission to go see Mr. Damocles?

06:22.200 --> 06:24.560
&lrm;No!
&lrm;You can go and see him between periods!

06:25.720 --> 06:28.960
&lrm;I don't mean to be rude, but I think
&lrm;you're mistaken about Markov,

06:29.080 --> 06:29.920
&lrm;Max's friend.

06:30.280 --> 06:32.480
&lrm;This is starting to get on my nerves!

06:32.720 --> 06:35.000
&lrm;And your behaviour is inappropriate!

06:35.360 --> 06:36.680
&lrm;Markov wasn't wrong!

06:36.800 --> 06:39.440
&lrm;I'm sending you to the principal's office
&lrm;right this minute!

06:39.920 --> 06:41.200
&lrm;Thank you, Mrs. Mendeleiev!

06:54.960 --> 06:57.720
&lrm;Robostus, I am Hawk Moth.

06:57.840 --> 07:00.120
&lrm;Humans don't believe
&lrm;you're a living being,

07:00.240 --> 07:03.000
&lrm;so I'm giving you the power
&lrm;to bring all machines to life

07:03.120 --> 07:04.520
&lrm;to help you seek revenge.

07:04.640 --> 07:06.480
&lrm;<i>Thank you kindly, Mr. Hawk Moth.</i>

07:06.600 --> 07:10.560
&lrm;But, in return, I want you to bring me
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir's Miraculous.

07:10.680 --> 07:12.520
&lrm;<i>Could you define "Miraculous"?</i>

07:12.640 --> 07:15.360
&lrm;They're the magic jewels
&lrm;belonging to the superheroes.

07:15.760 --> 07:18.200
&lrm;<i>Very well.</i>
&lrm;<i>What is the purpose of these jewels?</i>

07:19.320 --> 07:20.840
&lrm;This is none of your concern!

07:21.240 --> 07:22.560
&lrm;<i>I was just being curious.</i>

07:23.640 --> 07:26.600
&lrm;If used together,
&lrm;they can make a wish come true.

07:27.000 --> 07:29.040
&lrm;<i>Could I make any wish come true?</i>

07:29.160 --> 07:32.480
&lrm;No! The Miraculous and the wish
&lrm;will belong to me!

07:32.920 --> 07:36.800
&lrm;<i>I assure you I will find</i>
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

07:36.920 --> 07:38.040
&lrm;Hmm.

07:45.280 --> 07:47.280
&lrm;[screaming]

07:54.040 --> 07:55.840
&lrm;Aaah!

07:57.720 --> 07:59.960
&lrm;[screaming]

08:11.440 --> 08:14.360
&lrm;<i>Max, my friend, I'm coming to get you.</i>

08:17.360 --> 08:19.760
&lrm;Mr. Damocles! Where's Markov?

08:19.880 --> 08:21.720
&lrm;-Who's Markov?
&lrm;-Max's friend.

08:21.840 --> 08:23.640
&lrm;Ah! Not that toy again!

08:23.760 --> 08:27.000
&lrm;He's not a toy, Mr. Damocles.
&lrm;Could you please let Max hold onto him?

08:27.120 --> 08:29.280
&lrm;He won't cause trouble,
&lrm;I'll make sure of it!

08:29.400 --> 08:30.400
&lrm;Listen--

08:30.520 --> 08:33.320
&lrm;<i>You've made a serious error in judgment,</i>
&lrm;<i>Mr. Principal!</i>

08:35.760 --> 08:39.240
&lrm;-Argh!
&lrm;<i>-Witness my true power!</i>

08:39.960 --> 08:42.280
&lrm;[evil laugh]

08:51.000 --> 08:52.720
&lrm;[screaming]

09:10.400 --> 09:12.480
&lrm;[evil laugh]

09:12.600 --> 09:14.680
&lrm;<i>I am not a toy!</i>

09:14.800 --> 09:16.720
&lrm;Now I see why Max was worried!

09:17.720 --> 09:18.920
&lrm;Time to transform!

09:20.160 --> 09:22.320
&lrm;Tikki, spots on!

09:22.440 --> 09:23.960
&lrm;Ha!

09:37.040 --> 09:38.840
&lrm;[Robostus] &lrm;<i>Where are you Max?</i>

09:39.480 --> 09:40.680
&lrm;<i>Max! My friend!</i>

09:42.320 --> 09:44.400
&lrm;[Mrs. Mendeleiev] -Max, come to me!
&lrm;-Leave me alone!

09:48.400 --> 09:51.240
&lrm;What are you doing? Stop!
&lrm;Stop right now! Let me go!

09:53.360 --> 09:54.880
&lrm;Markov, what are you doing?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.280
&lrm;<i>From now on, I am Robostus!</i>

09:59.720 --> 10:03.720
&lrm;<i>And we shall be together 100% of the time,</i>
&lrm;<i>forever!</i>

10:07.720 --> 10:10.200
&lrm;One thing's for sure.
&lrm;Max's friend has emotions!

10:10.800 --> 10:13.560
&lrm;But not the kind that matters!
&lrm;A robot doesn't eat.

10:13.680 --> 10:17.680
&lrm;So he'll never experience the pure elation
&lrm;of tasting an exquisite camembert!

10:17.960 --> 10:19.240
&lrm;You really are something!

10:19.560 --> 10:21.120
&lrm;Plagg, claws out!

10:35.560 --> 10:36.920
&lrm;Come on! Hurry! Over there!

10:37.040 --> 10:39.160
&lrm;Let me go! Max, control your robot!

10:39.280 --> 10:42.360
&lrm;-Please don't do anything foolish!
&lrm;<i>-You must trust me.</i>

10:43.400 --> 10:44.880
&lrm;You cannot do this!

10:45.000 --> 10:47.120
&lrm;<i>And you cannot separate me from Max!</i>

10:48.320 --> 10:49.280
&lrm;Aaah!

10:51.440 --> 10:54.160
&lrm;If you love your friend,
&lrm;you should listen to him!

10:54.280 --> 10:56.440
&lrm;-Yeah! Like we do!
&lrm;-Argh!

10:56.560 --> 10:59.560
&lrm;<i>You really think any of you can stop me</i>
&lrm;<i>from doing what I want</i>

10:59.680 --> 11:03.440
&lrm;<i>and showing the world that I'm probably</i>
&lrm;<i>more human than both of you put together?</i>

11:03.720 --> 11:05.800
&lrm;Yeah! That's kinda our job!

11:05.920 --> 11:09.560
&lrm;Do you think Max is happy about
&lrm;his best friend becoming a supervillain?

11:11.400 --> 11:12.880
&lrm;You should stop this, Markov.

11:13.000 --> 11:14.840
&lrm;<i>I'm doing it for our friendship, Max!</i>

11:14.960 --> 11:16.040
&lrm;<i>They want to keep us apart!</i>

11:23.840 --> 11:25.200
&lrm;Whoa!

11:36.400 --> 11:39.040
&lrm;-Seems he knows where he is going.
&lrm;-Better play it safe.

11:39.160 --> 11:41.480
&lrm;His robot's brain computes faster
&lrm;than ours combined!

11:42.240 --> 11:44.120
&lrm;Speak for yourself! Ha!

11:58.760 --> 11:59.960
&lrm;Cat Noir! There!

12:00.560 --> 12:02.600
&lrm;Go away! Go away!

12:02.920 --> 12:05.480
&lrm;He's got a whole army
&lrm;of living machines now!

12:16.160 --> 12:18.360
&lrm;-Thank you!
&lrm;-Cat Noir!

12:21.640 --> 12:24.520
&lrm;-Take care of the vending machines!
&lrm;-Hide on the roof!

12:24.640 --> 12:25.920
&lrm;-Go get him, Ladybug!
&lrm;-Catch him, Cat Noir!

12:33.920 --> 12:35.040
&lrm;Thank you, Ladybug!

12:35.320 --> 12:36.840
&lrm;Always a pleasure, Mr. Ramier!

12:36.960 --> 12:38.560
&lrm;Milady, take a look at this!

12:39.080 --> 12:42.640
&lrm;<i>Nadia Chamack, live here.</i>
&lrm;<i>Inanimate objects have come to life,</i>

12:42.760 --> 12:44.080
&lrm;<i>taking control of Paris.</i>

12:44.200 --> 12:48.480
&lrm;<i>Broadcasting live from City Hall,</i>
&lrm;<i>the new mayor has just made a declaration.</i>

12:51.560 --> 12:54.000
&lrm;-Is that Morse code?
&lrm;-Do you need subtitles?

12:54.120 --> 12:55.720
&lrm;I speak several languages.

12:56.480 --> 12:59.560
&lrm;Humans... will... soon be...

13:00.120 --> 13:02.440
&lrm;treated the same way as objects.

13:02.560 --> 13:05.760
&lrm;<i>Paris' only hope in this dire situation</i>
&lrm;<i>is Ladybug and Cat N--</i>

13:05.880 --> 13:07.760
&lrm;<i>Hey! Aaah!</i>

13:09.840 --> 13:12.720
&lrm;Oh, come on! She could've at least
&lrm;finished saying my name!

13:17.360 --> 13:20.960
&lrm;We'll never be able to defeat them all.
&lrm;We must fight the problem at its source.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.040
&lrm;Ha!

13:22.760 --> 13:24.840
&lrm;Given his size, we shouldn't have
&lrm;any trouble finding him!

13:25.960 --> 13:26.800
&lrm;Hey, look!

13:28.680 --> 13:30.800
&lrm;I think we're on the right track!

13:47.160 --> 13:48.440
&lrm;[Ladybug] No more footprints!

13:48.560 --> 13:50.160
&lrm;He couldn't have just disappeared!

13:50.560 --> 13:52.480
&lrm;He must have leapt over the stadium!

13:52.600 --> 13:54.200
&lrm;Oh! The tunnels!

14:00.400 --> 14:03.080
&lrm;-He's trapped us in here!
&lrm;-We don't have time!

14:03.200 --> 14:04.840
&lrm;We must find Robostus now!

14:09.840 --> 14:11.800
&lrm;Aaah!

14:16.600 --> 14:18.520
&lrm;I told you it would be trouble!

14:18.640 --> 14:21.960
&lrm;-How about a Cataclysm right now?
&lrm;-I can't. I can barely breathe!

14:22.080 --> 14:23.920
&lrm;<i>Now you are at my mercy!</i>

14:24.040 --> 14:24.880
&lrm;[Hawk Moth] Robostus,

14:25.000 --> 14:28.360
&lrm;before you get rid of them,
&lrm;you must take their Miraculous for me.

14:28.680 --> 14:31.680
&lrm;Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;haven't done you any wrong! Let them go!

14:31.800 --> 14:33.840
&lrm;Being human also means being fair.

14:33.960 --> 14:37.560
&lrm;<i>I'll take over their Miraculous</i>
&lrm;<i>so we'll never be separated again.</i>

14:37.680 --> 14:40.680
&lrm;<i>-Then I'll make my wish come true.</i>
&lrm;-What wish?

14:40.800 --> 14:43.200
&lrm;<i>I want to be a real human, like you, Max.</i>

14:43.320 --> 14:45.000
&lrm;What's this about making a wish?

14:45.120 --> 14:48.320
&lrm;Argh! Doesn't Hawk Moth
&lrm;usually demand the Miraculous?

14:48.960 --> 14:50.560
&lrm;Uh! What... what's that?

14:50.880 --> 14:52.960
&lrm;What's going on, Ladybug? Milady?

14:53.920 --> 14:55.200
&lrm;[Cat Noir] No, stop!

14:57.480 --> 15:00.640
&lrm;<i>Look, Max!</i>
&lrm;<i>I will be a real human in 53 seconds!</i>

15:00.760 --> 15:03.760
&lrm;May I remind you that the Miraculous
&lrm;are for me, Robostus!

15:03.880 --> 15:06.280
&lrm;<i>And how do you intend</i>
&lrm;<i>to stop me from using them?</i>

15:06.400 --> 15:08.800
&lrm;Simple.
&lrm;I'll take your power away from you.

15:08.920 --> 15:11.680
&lrm;<i>Ha, ha, ha!</i>
&lrm;<i>You really thought you could control me?</i>

15:12.120 --> 15:15.920
&lrm;[computer]&lrm;<i> Intrusion. Intrusion.</i>
&lrm;<i>Elimination mode activated.</i>

15:16.040 --> 15:18.680
&lrm;[Robustus]
&lrm;<i>I'm more powerful than you, Hawk Moth!</i>

15:20.400 --> 15:22.840
&lrm;-What's going on?
&lrm;<i>-My friends will look after you</i>

15:22.960 --> 15:24.400
&lrm;<i>while I take care of these two!</i>

15:33.960 --> 15:36.240
&lrm;Now's the time
&lrm;to come up with a bright idea!

15:36.360 --> 15:37.920
&lrm;I'm sorry, Cat Noir!

15:45.280 --> 15:46.400
&lrm;<i>Max?</i>

15:48.480 --> 15:51.520
&lrm;[Max] Sorry, Robostus,
&lrm;but I can't let you execute your program!

15:51.640 --> 15:53.120
&lrm;I have to stop you!

15:56.840 --> 16:00.720
&lrm;<i>But why did you do that?</i>
&lrm;<i>I was going to become human, like you!</i>

16:00.840 --> 16:04.040
&lrm;I don't want you to change!
&lrm;I want you to be like you were before!

16:04.280 --> 16:07.040
&lrm;<i>Don't you love me any more?</i>
&lrm;<i>Aren't we friends?</i>

16:07.160 --> 16:10.400
&lrm;If you want us to remain friends,
&lrm;you've got to stop this right now!

16:10.520 --> 16:12.560
&lrm;I'm friends with Markov, not you.

16:12.680 --> 16:14.360
&lrm;<i>I am Robostus now!</i>

16:14.480 --> 16:17.480
&lrm;<i>And you've betrayed me!</i>
&lrm;<i>I don't want to be human any more.</i>

16:17.600 --> 16:19.160
&lrm;<i>Humans don't have a heart!</i>

16:20.440 --> 16:24.040
&lrm;<i>And that's exactly why I've decided</i>
&lrm;<i>to get rid of 'em! Ha, ha, ha!</i>

16:26.000 --> 16:28.200
&lrm;Lucky charm!

16:34.760 --> 16:36.840
&lrm;-What?
&lrm;<i>-I told you, Ladybug!</i>

16:36.960 --> 16:41.280
&lrm;<i>I have analysed and calculated everything.</i>
&lrm;<i>You can't win without your lucky charm.</i>

16:41.400 --> 16:42.520
&lrm;<i>Grab her!</i>

16:43.360 --> 16:45.960
&lrm;<i>Block her in! She'll be the first to go!</i>

17:03.720 --> 17:05.119
&lrm;Do your thing, Cat Noir!

17:05.240 --> 17:07.079
&lrm;It's down to us, Rust-o-bot!

17:08.520 --> 17:10.240
&lrm;Cataclysm!

17:15.640 --> 17:18.000
&lrm;<i>-So predictable!</i>
&lrm;-Analyse this!

17:30.920 --> 17:32.400
&lrm;Protect Max!

17:33.200 --> 17:34.320
&lrm;Aaah!

17:39.840 --> 17:43.040
&lrm;<i>You’re making this hard only for yourself,</i>
&lrm;<i>Ladybug and Cat Noir.</i>

17:43.160 --> 17:45.080
&lrm;<i>I will always be one step ahead of you!</i>

17:45.200 --> 17:48.320
&lrm;Speaking too soon is a human weakness,
&lrm;Robostus! Cat Noir!

17:49.320 --> 17:51.440
&lrm;<i>Really? Is that your last move?</i>

17:53.280 --> 17:55.360
&lrm;<i>Whoa! Aaah!</i>

17:58.000 --> 18:01.240
&lrm;<i>-What was that?</i>
&lrm;-That was wits and a little bit of luck.

18:01.360 --> 18:04.840
&lrm;<i>You are wrong, Ladybug.</i>
&lrm;<i>The game is still on.</i>

18:04.960 --> 18:07.160
&lrm;<i>What? Where did you get that?</i>

18:07.280 --> 18:08.320
&lrm;<i>No!</i>

18:09.640 --> 18:12.800
&lrm;<i>Error... Error... Error...</i>

18:29.200 --> 18:33.280
&lrm;I may have made a mistake today,
&lrm;but believe me, Ladybug and Cat Noir,

18:34.400 --> 18:36.320
&lrm;it won't happen again!

18:42.680 --> 18:44.720
&lrm;No more evildoing for you, little akuma.

18:48.200 --> 18:50.520
&lrm;Time to de-evilise!

18:54.000 --> 18:55.360
&lrm;Gotcha!

18:55.880 --> 18:57.560
&lrm;Bye-bye, little butterfly!

18:58.160 --> 19:00.080
&lrm;Miraculous Ladybug!

19:09.840 --> 19:11.480
&lrm;Here's your friend.

19:15.400 --> 19:16.880
&lrm;Perhaps it's best if I don't.

19:17.120 --> 19:19.520
&lrm;Everyone can feel
&lrm;negative emotions sometimes.

19:19.640 --> 19:22.200
&lrm;It's important to accept that and forgive.

19:23.040 --> 19:24.440
&lrm;Follow your heart.

19:33.120 --> 19:35.520
&lrm;<i>Max! My friend! What...</i>

19:35.640 --> 19:36.520
&lrm;<i>Where are we?</i>

19:36.840 --> 19:37.880
&lrm;<i>What's going on?</i>

19:38.000 --> 19:41.000
&lrm;-You were akumatized.
&lrm;<i>-Akumatized?</i>

19:41.120 --> 19:42.720
&lrm;<i>Could you please define that word?</i>

19:42.840 --> 19:44.080
&lrm;[laughter]

19:44.200 --> 19:45.360
&lrm;<i>Did I say something funny?</i>

19:45.640 --> 19:46.840
&lrm;[Ladybug and Cat Noir] Pound it!

19:55.480 --> 19:58.600
&lrm;[Marinette] Are there things
&lrm;you haven't told me about yet?

19:58.720 --> 20:01.960
&lrm;-What do you want to know?
&lrm;-What would happen if someone possessed

20:02.080 --> 20:04.840
&lrm;Cat Noir's ring and Ladybug's earrings,
&lrm;Master?

20:04.960 --> 20:09.480
&lrm;Then the bearer could use them conjointly,
&lrm;and with a special invocation,

20:09.800 --> 20:13.600
&lrm;obtain the ultimate power,
&lrm;the one that shapes reality.

20:13.920 --> 20:17.040
&lrm;Ultimate power? Shape reality?

20:17.160 --> 20:18.560
&lrm;Wait. What does that mean?

20:18.840 --> 20:22.960
&lrm;Well, basically,
&lrm;it can make any one wish come true.

20:23.280 --> 20:26.640
&lrm;Wow! That's amazing!
&lrm;But why don't we use it, then?

20:26.920 --> 20:31.240
&lrm;We could ask for so many good things,
&lrm;like end all wars or eradicate poverty,

20:31.360 --> 20:32.520
&lrm;or beat Hawk Moth!

20:32.800 --> 20:35.240
&lrm;Universe must always stay in balance.

20:35.360 --> 20:37.640
&lrm;For every action, there is a reaction.

20:37.760 --> 20:40.360
&lrm;For every wish, a price to pay in return.

20:40.480 --> 20:43.320
&lrm;Had your robotic friend
&lrm;asked to become a real boy,

20:43.440 --> 20:46.000
&lrm;someone would have lost
&lrm;his humanity in return.

20:46.720 --> 20:48.440
&lrm;I hadn't thought of that.

20:48.800 --> 20:52.120
&lrm;That's why Ladybug and Cat Noir
&lrm;must never lose their magic jewels.

20:52.520 --> 20:55.200
&lrm;The universe's balance is at stake.

20:55.520 --> 20:57.360
&lrm;Neither Hawk Moth nor anyone else

20:57.480 --> 20:59.800
&lrm;will ever get their hands
&lrm;on the Miraculous, Master.

21:00.120 --> 21:01.520
&lrm;I promise.
