John the Revelator

01:28.338 --> 01:31.882
Wrote the book of the seven seals

01:31.966 --> 01:36.053
You know, God walked down
In the cool of the day

01:36.137 --> 01:38.931
Called Adam by his name

01:39.891 --> 01:42.851
And he refused to answer

01:42.936 --> 01:47.815
Because he's naked and ashamed

John the Revelator

01:58.701 --> 02:02.204

02:02.288 --> 02:06.375

02:06.459 --> 02:09.919
And three he led away

02:10.003 --> 02:16.927

Yes, sir. Released yesterday.

04:13.461 --> 04:14.962
Did you tell him about Jake?

04:15.505 --> 04:17.547
No, sir. l thought you told him.

l'm sorry.

Who's that?

05:23.072 --> 05:25.365
Your old drummer, Willie.

05:26.242 --> 05:27.659
l dance at his club.

05:27.869 --> 05:30.495
They told him you were out
and he asked me to come check on you.

05:30.747 --> 05:32.914
He said he'd give you a job.

05:35.626 --> 05:38.086

-What can l do for you, boy?
-Sir,

05:57.440 --> 05:58.648
how much would something like

05:58.733 --> 06:02.152
that full-sized Ford police package
in the middle there run me?

06:02.236 --> 06:06.615
Get yourself $500
and you come back to see me then.

06:07.158 --> 06:08.784
Okay, sir.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.580
That's a nice car.

06:14.582 --> 06:15.624
l'll save it for you.

06:16.417 --> 06:18.001
Thanks.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.389
l wasn't sure
you were going to come, Elwood.

06:31.099 --> 06:35.143
Hey, a letter from you
is like a command, Sister. You know that.

06:35.770 --> 06:41.316
-Actually, it's Mother Mary now.
-That's a promotion, isn't it?

06:43.069 --> 06:45.028
l'm sorry to hear about Jake.

06:45.530 --> 06:50.325
Yeah, well, l guess
he's in a much better place.

06:54.539 --> 06:55.664
Uh...

06:55.748 --> 06:57.582
Where is Curtis?

06:58.668 --> 07:01.878
Curtis has gone on as well, Elwood.
l'm sorry.

07:02.588 --> 07:05.090
So, that's why he stopped writing me.

07:07.260 --> 07:10.679
He was very upset
when the orphanage closed.

07:11.389 --> 07:14.683
Curtis was the closest thing to a dad
that Jake and l ever had.

07:15.435 --> 07:17.185
He gave us the music.

07:17.353 --> 07:23.191
The Lord works in mysterious ways, Elwood.
We all must go on and fight the good fight.

07:23.276 --> 07:26.445
The orphanage is gone, Jake's gone,
Curtis is gone.

07:26.529 --> 07:30.031
l got no brother, l got no roots, l got no life.
l got nothing, for Christ's sake.

Young man...

07:33.661 --> 07:34.661
Ow!

07:34.912 --> 07:36.955
...you were not taught and raised by me

07:37.039 --> 07:40.417
to fold at the slightest whiff
of adverse circumstances.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.795
Now quit your silly moping,

07:43.880 --> 07:46.756

and snap out of it!

07:46.883 --> 07:48.133
But... (EXCLAlMS)

07:48.801 --> 07:53.388
But nothing! Wise up!
Turn your heart to the Creator.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.390
You are so quick to despair.

07:55.475 --> 07:59.102
You are not the only person in the world
who has had tragedy in their lives.

08:00.563 --> 08:03.190
You didn't know that Curtis had a son,
did you?

08:04.358 --> 08:06.776
Curtis had a son?

08:06.903 --> 08:10.947
Before Curtis came to us
at St. Helen of the Blessed Shroud

08:11.032 --> 08:15.535
he had a musical group
that toured the juke joints of the Midwest.

08:15.620 --> 08:19.831
ln one town,
Curtis had an affair with a married woman.

08:20.291 --> 08:21.708
Go, Curtis.

08:22.793 --> 08:25.545
l mean, that's terrible.

08:25.880 --> 08:27.756
That's what l thought you meant.

08:27.840 --> 08:32.385
Anyway, the woman became pregnant
and decided to remain with her husband,

08:32.470 --> 08:36.014
never telling him
that the boy child wasn't his.

08:36.097 --> 08:37.849
Curtis was devastated.

08:38.142 --> 08:40.309
He came to us as a custodian

08:40.394 --> 08:45.023
and spent the rest of his life
caring for little orphans like you, Elwood.

08:45.107 --> 08:46.107
(CRYlNG)

08:49.779 --> 08:50.987
Thanks.

08:55.451 --> 08:57.786
That's a beautiful story.

09:02.708 --> 09:05.210
Hey, wait a minute. lf Curtis had a son,

09:05.294 --> 09:09.214
then that guy would be
kind of like my stepbrother.

09:09.298 --> 09:10.632
l have a family.

09:10.883 --> 09:13.969
Curtis always stayed in touch
with the boy's mother.

09:14.053 --> 09:16.179
He sent his paycheck every week.

09:16.430 --> 09:18.515
Where is this boy now?

09:18.599 --> 09:22.227
He's a grown man now, Elwood,
and doing quite well.

09:22.311 --> 09:24.771
Lives in the city.
His name is Cabel Chamberlain.

09:25.106 --> 09:27.315
Cabel Chamberlain.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.610
He doesn't know anything about Curtis,
and it's not your place to tell him.

09:30.903 --> 09:32.571
l wouldn't say anything.

09:32.863 --> 09:35.031
Do you know
anything about mentoring, Elwood?

09:35.741 --> 09:38.493
No. What about it?

09:38.619 --> 09:40.954
There's someone l'd like you to meet.

09:42.665 --> 09:45.375
Sister, would you send Buster
in here, please?

09:45.710 --> 09:47.043
Wait a minute.

09:47.169 --> 09:48.336
Thank you.

09:50.673 --> 09:51.715
l...

09:55.344 --> 09:57.846
Come in, Buster, and sit down.

10:04.687 --> 10:06.438
Elwood, say hello to Buster.

10:07.023 --> 10:08.356
Hi. How ya doing?

10:08.566 --> 10:10.525
Buster, say hello to Elwood.

10:11.110 --> 10:12.402
Hi. How ya doing?

10:13.529 --> 10:15.780
Hey, the kid's a wiseass.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.450
(EXCLAlMlNG) Shit!

10:19.910 --> 10:20.952
What did you say?

10:21.162 --> 10:24.914
l said, what a sweet kid.

10:24.999 --> 10:28.126
That's more like it. Now, here's my proposal.

10:28.210 --> 10:31.921
Young Buster here is a ward of the state,
and due to lack of space

10:32.006 --> 10:36.718
the archdiocese has agreed to house
homeless children here at the hospital.

10:37.094 --> 10:39.346
What's that got to do with me?

10:39.472 --> 10:42.599
l thought perhaps that you would
come and spend time with Buster.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.979
Why don't you take Buster here to the library
in the meantime?

10:48.397 --> 10:51.399
You know, l've been jacked around...

10:54.111 --> 10:56.863
The library. No problem.

10:58.699 --> 11:00.784
See you in two hours, boys.

11:02.745 --> 11:04.454
Okay, kid, here's the deal.

11:04.538 --> 11:07.082
You wait here
and l'll come back for you with the car.

11:09.752 --> 11:11.503

11:33.109 --> 11:34.776
-Thanks for the ride.
-Yeah, no problem.

11:51.210 --> 11:52.919
Hey, kid, are you stalking me?

12:00.052 --> 12:02.095
What are you, 1 5? Seventeen?

12:02.972 --> 12:04.055
l'm 1 0.

12:04.682 --> 12:06.015
Ten, huh?

12:07.059 --> 12:10.562
Look, l know what you're going through.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.064
You're lonely,
searching for your place in life.

12:13.149 --> 12:14.774
Just don't blow it like l did.

12:14.859 --> 12:17.736
Stay away from drugs, gangs,
cyber porn on the lnternet,

12:17.820 --> 12:20.155
and you could be
President of the United States someday.

12:22.575 --> 12:25.618
But l don't want to be
President of the United States.

12:25.870 --> 12:27.912
Look, l'm busy.
l got kind of a brother in there.

12:27.997 --> 12:29.914
He must be in some kind of trouble.

12:29.999 --> 12:34.794
Besides, you don't want to hang around
with some over-40 recidivist.

12:34.879 --> 12:36.379
Now scram.

Blues. Elwood J. Blues.

and glasses off in my office, please?

13:17.171 --> 13:20.590

13:20.674 --> 13:24.886
Now, what exactly is the nature
of your visit here, Mr. Blues?

13:25.054 --> 13:26.638
Well, it's like this. See,

13:26.722 --> 13:28.556
-l used to be in a band...
-Yes.

13:28.641 --> 13:31.601
...called the Blues Brothers.

13:31.685 --> 13:32.644
So?

13:32.728 --> 13:36.064
With a partner whose name was Jake Blues.

13:36.398 --> 13:37.398
Go on.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.070
(COMPUTER BEEPlNG)

13:43.656 --> 13:46.115
And you are our long-lost brother.

13:48.369 --> 13:52.288
Mr. Blues, l am an only child.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.416
Yeah, but your real father
was like a real father to me, too.

13:56.001 --> 13:57.001
My real father?

13:57.294 --> 13:58.545
Yeah, Curtis.

13:59.505 --> 14:01.798
Have you noticed, Mr. Blues,
that l am an African American?

14:02.091 --> 14:04.259
Yeah, that's okay. So was Curtis.

14:08.013 --> 14:11.391
You see, your mother and Curtis
had an extramarital affair,

14:11.767 --> 14:14.018
which produced a little boy, that's you.

14:15.354 --> 14:20.024
My father passed away 14 years ago.

14:20.109 --> 14:24.612
He was a full bird colonel
in the United States Air Force.

14:24.697 --> 14:27.532
My mother now lives in Phoenix, Arizona,

14:27.616 --> 14:33.454
and a more honorable, sweet-tempered
and goodly woman does not exist.

14:33.914 --> 14:36.457
Look, l'm not making
any moral judgments here,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.335
but one can project
what might have happened in this case.

14:39.420 --> 14:42.922
Your mom, young,
her husband in the military,

14:43.007 --> 14:45.383
away from home much of the time,

14:45.467 --> 14:49.554
which may have pushed her to reach out,
stray from the nest.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.638
That's enough.

14:52.641 --> 14:54.142
Just a minute.

in my office here who's telling me

15:08.824 --> 15:11.701
some story about some man named Curtis.

15:16.332 --> 15:17.457
What?

15:19.543 --> 15:20.710
Right.

15:27.009 --> 15:29.427
So, what precisely is it you want from me?

15:29.678 --> 15:32.555
Well, seeing as we're
kind of like stepbrothers,

15:32.640 --> 15:34.724
l thought maybe, you know,
you could help me out.

15:34.975 --> 15:36.059
How could l do that?

15:36.226 --> 15:38.144
l need 500 bucks for this car, see.

15:38.604 --> 15:42.440
And l thought maybe you could, you know,
loan me the money. Or...

15:42.608 --> 15:44.025
Or what?

15:44.318 --> 15:46.778
l'm thinking of putting
the band back together.

15:46.862 --> 15:48.071
Maybe you could join us.

15:50.532 --> 15:56.913
l am a commander in the lllinois State Police.
And l enjoy my job.

15:56.997 --> 16:00.875
You waltz in here telling me that l have

16:00.960 --> 16:05.296
a dead, white, criminal brother,
who was in a band,

16:05.381 --> 16:11.511
which the last time they played anywhere
were charged with grand larceny,

16:12.554 --> 16:17.058
reckless endangerment,
felonious motor vehicle assault,

16:17.309 --> 16:21.729
over 700 violations
of the Highway Traffic Act,

16:21.897 --> 16:28.528
and damages, both public and private,
in excess of $24 million.

16:28.612 --> 16:32.532
And you are asking me
if l want to join this band?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.659
l could show you all the moves.

16:34.743 --> 16:38.162
Get the hell out of my office, right now!

16:39.415 --> 16:41.040

Well, you're lucky you came by today.
l'm selling the place tomorrow.

18:00.329 --> 18:03.122
searched the grounds
