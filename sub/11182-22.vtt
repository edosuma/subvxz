01:11.439 --> 01:13.341
Well, it's about time.
What were you doing?

01:13.407 --> 01:15.576
I was fixing five-minute eggs.

01:15.643 --> 01:17.278
You've been in there
for 20 minutes.

01:17.345 --> 01:19.380
It took me 15 minutes
to eat 'em.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.585
Hey, ain't you forgetting
about my breakfast?

01:24.652 --> 01:26.320
No, you're forgetting
it's my day off.

01:26.387 --> 01:28.289
And I don't do nothing
on my day off.

01:28.356 --> 01:30.724
Hmm! You don't do nothing
on your days on.

01:41.435 --> 01:44.104
Florence, what are you doing?

01:44.172 --> 01:46.674
Making sure the sofa
don't go nowhere.

01:48.809 --> 01:52.045
But I thought you had a date
to go ice skating today.

01:52.112 --> 01:54.948
Oh, I did.
But that turkey called
and said he had to work.

01:55.015 --> 01:57.518
-What a liar.
-Well, how do you know
he's lying?

01:57.585 --> 01:59.653
-Millie told me.
-How does she know?

01:59.720 --> 02:03.123
Because she called
to borrow my ice skates.
He's taking her instead.

02:04.492 --> 02:06.660
Oh, that's a shame.

02:06.727 --> 02:10.063
What kind of a guy
would break a date
at the last minute?

02:10.130 --> 02:13.701
The same kind of guy
who would ask me out
in the first place.

02:13.767 --> 02:15.669
-Huh?
-Let's face it,
Miss Jefferson,

02:15.736 --> 02:18.606
I'm just not
an interesting person.

02:18.672 --> 02:21.074
Well, I think you're
interesting, Florence.

02:21.141 --> 02:23.377
-You wanna take me
ice skating?
-No.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.279
I mean, yes. I mean...

02:25.346 --> 02:28.816
Look, Miss Jefferson,
all I do all day is
dust, mop and scrub.

02:28.882 --> 02:32.353
When I go out at night
I ain't got nothing
interesting to talk about.

02:32.420 --> 02:35.055
Florence, you have a lot
to offer a man.

02:35.122 --> 02:37.858
Mmm-hmm.
My last date I had to offer
to pay for dinner.

02:39.760 --> 02:42.530
Florence, you need a lift.
Why don't you come with me?

02:42.596 --> 02:46.600
I just have to make a quick
stop at the Help Center,
and then we can go shopping.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.269
Okay.

02:48.336 --> 02:50.838
-Florence,
where's the egg poacher?
-We ain't got one.

02:50.904 --> 02:52.540
Well, how am I supposed
to heat my eggs up?

02:52.606 --> 02:54.708
Try putting them
in front of your mouth.

02:58.646 --> 03:00.581
Uh, maybe you better go
help him.

03:00.648 --> 03:02.416
(DOORBELL RINGING)

03:02.483 --> 03:04.785
On second thought,
I'll help him,
you get the door.

03:04.852 --> 03:07.921
Good. I sure got
the best of that deal.

03:12.326 --> 03:14.094
-Oh, good morning, Florence.
-Hi, Mr. Bentley.

03:14.161 --> 03:16.364
I was wondering
if I might borrow
your feather duster.

03:16.430 --> 03:18.366
I haven't seen mine
for several days.

03:18.432 --> 03:21.702
Maybe it eloped
with a carrier pigeon.

03:21.769 --> 03:24.705
Ah, I see you've
started reading
Travels of the Countess.

03:24.772 --> 03:26.540
How do you like it so far?

03:26.607 --> 03:30.278
Oh, I love it.
Thanks for loaning it to me.

03:30.344 --> 03:32.580
Wouldn't it be fun
to be a countess?

03:32.646 --> 03:35.983
Well, actually,
I'd rather be a count.

03:36.049 --> 03:40.988
That Countess, she got more
boyfriends in one chapter
than I had in my whole life.

03:41.054 --> 03:44.425
Yes.
Everywhere she goes,
men fight over her.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.860
-Didn't you ever have men
fight over you, Florence?
-Sure.

03:46.927 --> 03:49.830
On 42nd Street.
They were both trying
to steal my pocketbook.

03:52.900 --> 03:55.836
Did you get to the part
yet where the, uh,
the French diplomat

03:55.903 --> 03:58.739
tries to win her heart
away from the young
fencing instructor?

03:58.806 --> 04:00.741
Yeah, I'm reading
that part now.

04:00.808 --> 04:02.710
And they had this
dueling contest
to see who would win her.

04:03.677 --> 04:04.945
En garde!

04:05.012 --> 04:06.780
Ah!

Take that, you swine! Aah!

04:15.956 --> 04:19.493
And now, ma cherie Countess,
will you be mine?

04:20.528 --> 04:21.662
Um...

04:25.499 --> 04:30.638
I'm sorry, Jean Paul,
but I travels with the wind,
like a bird.

04:30.704 --> 04:33.106
And a free bird
cannot be caged.

04:33.173 --> 04:35.242
Oh, my Countess.
(EXCLAIMS)

04:39.112 --> 04:41.382
I sure would love to be
like the Countess.

04:41.449 --> 04:43.317
Now that's an interesting
woman.

04:43.384 --> 04:46.286
Ah, that's because
she isn't just one woman.

04:46.354 --> 04:49.390
-Huh?
-No, she's many women
to many men.

04:49.457 --> 04:52.393
To one man, she's a countess.
To another,
she's a temptress.

04:52.460 --> 04:55.429
You mean men like it
when a woman is
more than one person?

04:55.496 --> 04:59.032
Oh, yes, indeed.
Give me a woman of mystery
any day.

04:59.099 --> 05:01.101
Or better yet, any night.
Woof.

05:03.504 --> 05:06.874
-George, I'm taking Florence
to Bloomingdale's.
-Oh, yeah?

05:06.940 --> 05:09.109
See if you can exchange her
for something that works.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.347
How about it, Florence?
Are you ready?

05:13.414 --> 05:15.583
Yeah, but I ain't got
no money to buy nothing with.

05:15.649 --> 05:17.985
What! I just paid you
a full week's salary.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.287
I know.
I blew it all in a pay toilet.

05:25.959 --> 05:29.863
Just a quick stop
at the Help Center,
and then we'll go shopping

05:29.930 --> 05:32.032
and pick up something
that you like.

-'Cause my name's Nancy.

I'll just drop off
these papers

-and then we can leave.
-Oh, Louise, I've been trying
to reach you.

but it looks like I'm gonna be
tied up for a while.

06:49.943 --> 06:52.045
You better go shopping
without me.

to keep you waiting.

to take it?

tell me something
about yourself.

-Oh, you don't wanna hear
nothing about me.
-Sure, I do.

08:08.155 --> 08:10.423
Unless, of course,
you don't wanna tell me.

08:10.490 --> 08:13.827
Well, there ain't nothing
interesting to tell about me.
I'm just a...

08:15.563 --> 08:17.164
Just a countess.

08:18.766 --> 08:20.634
A countess?

08:20.701 --> 08:24.004
Yes, you see,
when I was real young
I married this count.

08:25.405 --> 08:29.643
But then he died,
and left me all his money.

08:31.111 --> 08:34.882
Well, um, what was your
husband a count of?

08:34.948 --> 08:37.885
On account of his father
was a count.

08:40.554 --> 08:42.155
That's very interesting.

08:42.222 --> 08:43.624
Oh, you think so?

08:43.691 --> 08:47.127
Yes, I do.
But I must admit that
from looking at you,

08:47.194 --> 08:49.897
I would have never known
that you were a countess.

08:49.963 --> 08:53.366
-Well, what do you
mean by that?
-Well, I, uh, I, I meant that

08:53.433 --> 08:55.235
as a compliment.

08:55.302 --> 08:59.573
You see, I always thought
of countesses as being
rather seditty.

expensive clothes.

makes her own clothes?

Florence the Countess
didn't make this dress.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.454

I'm more than one woman.
-You are?

of different women.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.401
Well, how many different
women are you?

09:28.468 --> 09:31.371
That's for me to know
and you to find out.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.842
Well, I would like to hear
all about it.

09:34.908 --> 09:39.246
-Now, Florence, how long have
you been different women?
-That depends.

09:39.312 --> 09:41.782

-Which one of me
you're asking.

waiting to see me.

Probably somebody more
interesting than I am.

I'll tell you, I haven't seen
anyone as interesting as you
in years.

-No, I haven't.

to come back and see me
tomorrow morning.

-Yes, I would.
We'll have more time then.

-Can you make it at 9:00?
-If I can get the day off.

-The day off?
-Uh, I mean, with all my
countessing and seamstressing,

10:28.095 --> 10:32.432
I'm usually busy.
But I guess I can fit you in
my busy schedule.

10:34.234 --> 10:38.205
That's great, because
I would really like to get
to know you better.

-Okay, Greg.
Um, I'll see you tomorrow.
-9:00 sharp.

-Fine.

out just great.

-How do you do?

Nancy, could you keep
my schedule free tomorrow?

most of the day.

11:17.377 --> 11:18.979
Why, yes.
Do you know her?

11:19.046 --> 11:21.815
Of course.
She's been our maid
for years.

11:23.150 --> 11:27.755
-Maid?
That's three personalities.
-I beg your pardon?

11:27.821 --> 11:33.693
Uh, oh, uh, Mrs. Jefferson,
has Florence ever said
anything to you about

11:33.761 --> 11:36.429
her being a countess
or a seamstress?

11:36.496 --> 11:39.199
A countess or a seamstress?

11:39.266 --> 11:43.136
-Uh, yes.
Are you aware of her problem?
-What problem?

11:44.304 --> 11:47.374
Well, I, I guess I can tell
you this much.

-I'm afraid that Florence
might be schizophrenic.
-What?

11:52.279 --> 11:56.183
Well, in talking with her,
she showed signs
of multiple personalities.

a long time, and she's always
been just, just Florence.

don't come up
till later in life.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.764
Is her condition serious?

12:11.431 --> 12:12.465
It could be.

In fact, it could be
very serious.

12:30.918 --> 12:34.221
* You light up my life

12:35.588 --> 12:38.691
* You give me hope

12:38.758 --> 12:41.728
With that voice you don't
need hope, you need charity.

12:44.331 --> 12:49.036
Oh, Florence, there you are.
Oh, I see you made it
home all right.

12:49.102 --> 12:51.238
Yeah, except for the
breakdown.

12:51.304 --> 12:54.441
Breakdown?
You had a breakdown?

12:54.507 --> 12:58.879
-No, the bus did.
-Oh, the bus.
Oh, of course.

13:01.982 --> 13:05.785
Are you all right,
Miss Jefferson?
You acting awful tense.

13:05.853 --> 13:09.789
Of course she's tense.
She's been hanging around
with you all morning.

13:09.857 --> 13:12.893
George, could you help me
in the kitchen?
I'm gonna get lunch.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.962
Look, Weezy,
if you're gonna eat
Florence's cooking,

13:15.028 --> 13:17.965
you won't need no help
till after lunch.

13:18.031 --> 13:20.868
-George, please.
-Weezy, I ain't finished
eating my sandwich yet!

13:20.934 --> 13:23.636
-Well, bring it with you!
I'll give you a doggy bag!
-What you doing...

13:25.505 --> 13:27.440
Okay, okay, here I am.
Now, what do you want?

13:27.507 --> 13:30.677
I'm afraid there's something
wrong with Florence.

13:30.743 --> 13:32.679
Why?
Did you see her
cleaning something?

13:39.953 --> 13:43.891
-George, Florence could be
schizophrenic.
-You're kidding!

13:45.425 --> 13:47.027
What does that mean?

13:52.232 --> 13:54.101
It means trouble.

13:54.167 --> 13:56.203
The psychiatrist from
the Help Center thinks

13:56.269 --> 13:58.738
Florence
has three personalities.

13:58.805 --> 14:00.807
Three personalities?
She ain't even got one.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.577
George, this is serious.

14:04.644 --> 14:08.648
Florence told Dr. Martin
she's a seamstress
and a countess.

14:08.715 --> 14:10.918
What?
She don't know
the first thing about sewing.

14:10.984 --> 14:14.121
And even less about counting.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.289
-And then
she told him she's...
-Look, Weezy,

14:16.356 --> 14:18.225
I don't care
what Florence
told this Dr. Martin.

14:18.291 --> 14:21.061
I know Florence.
She ain't crazy.
She's just lazy.

14:22.595 --> 14:24.064
But according to Dr. Martin...

14:24.131 --> 14:26.199
Will you forget about
this psychiatrist?

14:26.266 --> 14:28.668
If he's so smart,
why didn't he go on
to become a real doctor?

14:28.735 --> 14:30.737
Oh, George.

14:30.803 --> 14:32.172
Look, Weezy, I'm telling you
there's nothing wrong with
Florence.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.474
-Come on, I'll show you.
-George, wait.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.977
Don't start any arguments,
okay?

14:37.044 --> 14:40.813
The Doctor says we should go
along with Florence with
whatever she says.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.383
Okay.
As long as she don't ask me
for a raise.

14:46.886 --> 14:48.922
Oh, hey, Florence,
how you doing?

14:48.989 --> 14:51.091
I was doing fine
till you walked in.

14:51.158 --> 14:53.693
Well, why don't you walk out?
All three of you.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.228
(LAUGHING)

15:01.468 --> 15:03.170
What?

15:03.236 --> 15:04.904
-George.
-Okay, okay, Weezy,
let me handle it.

15:04.972 --> 15:08.775
Uh, Florence, ahem,
let's all have a little talk.

15:08.841 --> 15:12.980
Uh, George, Florence
doesn't want you bothering her
while she's reading.

15:13.046 --> 15:15.248
Oh, she don't mind.
Do you, Florence?

15:15.315 --> 15:19.319
Uh, Florence, how would you
describe the work you do?

15:19.386 --> 15:21.754
A hundred years ago
it was called slavery.

15:23.756 --> 15:26.459
Well, today it's called
stealing.

15:30.097 --> 15:32.299
Miss Jefferson,
can I have
the day off tomorrow?

15:32.365 --> 15:34.467
What?
You just had
the day off today.

15:34.534 --> 15:37.870
Of course you can have
tomorrow off, Florence.

15:37.937 --> 15:40.473
I got a big date tomorrow,
and it might take all day.

15:40.540 --> 15:42.042
Hmm!
Any dude that would spend

15:42.109 --> 15:45.278
all day with you
has gotta be
an all-day sucker.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.848
-George, why don't you...
-I ain't finished talking to
Florence yet!

15:48.915 --> 15:50.650
Okay, Florence,
(CLEARS THROAT)

15:50.717 --> 15:53.020
when you went
to the movies yesterday
by yourself,

15:53.086 --> 15:55.055
-how many tickets did you buy?
-Three.

15:58.691 --> 16:00.860
Florence,

16:02.829 --> 16:06.399
if you went alone,
why did you buy three tickets?

16:06.466 --> 16:09.469
What was I supposed to do,
leave the other two people
outside?

16:11.471 --> 16:15.075
Uh, what other two people,
dear?

16:15.142 --> 16:17.577
There were two little boys
who didn't have
enough money to get in,

16:17.644 --> 16:19.146
so I bought them tickets.

16:20.713 --> 16:23.416
Okay, Florence,
one more question.

16:23.483 --> 16:25.385
When you get up
in the morning,

16:25.452 --> 16:26.519
do you get out on
both sides of the bed
at the same time?

16:31.424 --> 16:34.761
-Is he crazy?
-Me? Weezy said it's you.

16:34.827 --> 16:38.798
George, I want a sandwich.
I want you to help me
make one.

16:38.865 --> 16:41.834
-Oh, I'll help you,
Miss Jefferson.
-No! No.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.873
See, Weezy? I told you
there ain't nothing wrong
with Florence.

16:46.939 --> 16:51.178
-But, George,
Dr. Martin said...
-Dr. Martin made a mistake.

16:51.244 --> 16:53.846
-Do you think so?
-Sure.
Doctors make lots of mistakes.

16:53.913 --> 16:55.882
That's why undertakers
are so rich.

16:57.784 --> 17:01.221
-Oh, George, I just don't know
what to believe.
-Okay, look, Weezy,

17:01.288 --> 17:03.990
if you're not convinced,
we can go talk to her
some more.

17:04.057 --> 17:09.062
Well, first I better make
a sandwich
so she doesn't get suspicious.

17:12.932 --> 17:15.001
Diana Ross,
eat your heart out.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.670
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

17:21.574 --> 17:24.111
-Oh, here you are, Florence.
Thank you.
-Oh, don't mention it.

17:24.177 --> 17:25.945
Wait a minute,
I got something for you, too.

17:28.348 --> 17:30.717
-Here's your book.
-Oh, you've already
finished it?

17:30.783 --> 17:32.585
No. And I don't think
I'm gonna have time.

17:32.652 --> 17:35.088
I got a real live man
to keep me busy.

17:35.155 --> 17:39.292
Oh, congratulations.
I'm sure you'll have a
happier ending than the book.

17:39.359 --> 17:40.793
Oh, yeah,
how does the book end?

17:40.860 --> 17:44.497
Oh, well, the Countess
meets Jean Paul again
30 years later,

17:44.564 --> 17:46.666
only now
he himself is a count.

17:46.733 --> 17:49.569
Seeing this,
she tries to egg him
into marrying her,

17:49.636 --> 17:52.472
even though the Count's
engaged to another woman.

17:52.539 --> 17:54.774
-And does she get him to
change his mind?
-Uh, no.

17:54.841 --> 17:59.179
In fact, because she eggs him
on so much, he marries the
other woman out of spite.

17:59.246 --> 18:01.114
Oh, that's too bad.

18:01.181 --> 18:04.817
Well, there is an interesting
moral to be learned from this.

18:04.884 --> 18:08.221
-What?
-Don't egg your counts
before they're hitched.

18:09.489 --> 18:10.923
Ta-ta.

18:15.362 --> 18:17.930
Mmm.

18:17.997 --> 18:22.669
You jive, Count.
It ain't nice to fool
with Mother Countess.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.907
You hear me, Count?

18:27.974 --> 18:32.011
And I bet your new wife
aren't as many different
women as I are.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.788
-Weezy?
-Yeah?

18:41.854 --> 18:44.224
I hope that doctor
makes house calls.

18:49.262 --> 18:50.530
(DOORBELL RINGING)

18:50.597 --> 18:54.667
Oh, George,
that must be him.
I'll get it.

18:54.734 --> 18:59.772
Oh, um, I'm sorry, Florence.
I was just gonna
get the door.

18:59.839 --> 19:04.010
Well, I was gonna get it,
but if you wanna get it,
get it.

19:04.076 --> 19:07.614
Well, I was gonna get it,
but of course,
if you wanna get it...

19:07.680 --> 19:09.148
I'll get it.

19:12.652 --> 19:14.454
-Excuse me. Is this the...
-Greg.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.923
-Hello, Florence.
-Well, what are you
doing here?

19:16.989 --> 19:19.426
-I came to see you.
-How'd you know where I live?

19:19.492 --> 19:23.296
-Florence.
-Oh, uh, Miss Jefferson,
this is Greg Martin,

19:23.363 --> 19:27.267
a friend of mine.
Greg, Mr. and Mrs.
Jefferson, my help.

19:28.935 --> 19:31.271
Help?

19:31.338 --> 19:34.874
Yes.
Now you've both been a great
help to me these past years.

19:34.941 --> 19:39.479
And I know how anxious you
are to get back to whatever
it was you were doing.

19:41.814 --> 19:43.115
We wasn't doing nothing.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.285
I know.

19:45.352 --> 19:48.955
And you're not gonna
be able to finish
if you don't hurry.

19:49.021 --> 19:53.025
Florence, why don't you make
yourself comfortable?
Can I get you anything, Greg?

19:53.092 --> 19:54.794
Oh, oh, he just loves
milk shakes.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.464
Why don't ya'll run down
to the corner and get him one?

19:57.530 --> 20:00.567
I know. I'll get you both
some coffee.
Come on, George.

20:00.633 --> 20:03.035
Florence, you and your friend
have a nice talk.

20:04.937 --> 20:08.140
Good help is so hard
to find these days.

20:08.207 --> 20:11.311
Well, Greg, what did you
want to talk to me about?

20:11.378 --> 20:15.315
Well, Florence, I would like
to get to know a lot more
about you.

20:15.382 --> 20:17.183
-You would?
-Yes, I would.

20:17.250 --> 20:20.453
And I've been thinking
we should spend some time
together, alone.

20:20.520 --> 20:22.655
Well, what did you have
in mind?

20:24.023 --> 20:25.392
How about this weekend?

20:25.458 --> 20:27.960
The whole weekend?

20:28.027 --> 20:32.432
Why, yes.
What would you say to a room
at Cedars by the Sea?

20:32.499 --> 20:36.469
That depends on how many
people are gonna be sharing
that room.

20:36.536 --> 20:41.140
I mean, we don't want to give
countesses a bad name.

20:41.207 --> 20:44.711
Have no fear.
You'll have a private room
all to yourself.

20:44.777 --> 20:48.548
-Oh, in that case,
I'd love to.
-Great.

20:48.615 --> 20:52.184
Oh, Miss Jefferson, do you
think you could do without me
for a couple of days?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.455
-Why?
-Well, Greg wants to take me
away with him for the weekend.

20:55.522 --> 20:58.825
Oh, that's just fine with us,
Florence.
Isn't it, George?

20:58.891 --> 21:01.328
Sure.
Stay as long as it takes for
Greg to help you.

21:01.394 --> 21:03.296
Help me?
What do you mean, "help me?"

21:03.363 --> 21:06.833
-Well, as your psychiatrist,
I'll be...
-Psychiatrist?

21:06.899 --> 21:08.868
I didn't know
you were no psychiatrist.

21:08.935 --> 21:11.137
Who did you think he was,
the Count of Monte Carlo?

21:14.974 --> 21:16.376
Don't worry, Florence.

21:16.443 --> 21:19.946
Dr. Martin will see
that you get all
the treatment you need.

21:20.012 --> 21:22.515
Treatment?
I don't need no treatment.

21:22.582 --> 21:25.885
Look, anybody goes around
saying that she's a countess
needs a lot of treatment.

21:25.952 --> 21:29.088
Wait a minute.
You mean just because
I told you I was a countess,

21:29.155 --> 21:32.659
-you think I'm crazy?
-No, no, no, no, no,
not crazy, Florence.

21:32.725 --> 21:36.228
-Just a little disoriented.
-Huh?

21:36.295 --> 21:40.600
-Well, you are not a countess.
-I know.
And I ain't crazy either.

21:41.868 --> 21:43.202
(DOORBELL RINGING)

21:43.269 --> 21:45.705
Don't worry, Florence.
I'll see that everyone
at the hospital

21:45.772 --> 21:47.474
-takes very good care of you.
-Hospital!

21:47.540 --> 21:50.810
Wait a minute, I don't need
to go to no hospital.
Ya'll don't understand.

21:50.877 --> 21:54.481
-Hello, Mr. J.
-Oh, Mr. Bentley.
Thank goodness!

21:54.547 --> 21:56.015
Tell them! Tell them!

21:56.082 --> 22:00.219
Oh, I'll be glad to tell them.
You see...
Tell them what?

22:02.254 --> 22:04.256
About the book.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.893
Oh, actually, that's why
I came, to return this recipe
you left in the book.

22:06.959 --> 22:09.095
Well, now tell them
about the countess.

22:09.161 --> 22:12.865
Oh, uh, yes, the countess.
The lovely lady of mystery.

22:12.932 --> 22:14.867
Well, tell them how she was
all these bunch of
different women,

22:14.934 --> 22:16.102
and how men like that stuff.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.336
Well, yes, it's true.

22:17.404 --> 22:19.472
She certainly had the men
at her feet.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.973
See, I was just trying
to be like her.

22:21.040 --> 22:22.141
That's why I told you
all that stuff.

22:22.208 --> 22:23.843
I didn't know you
was no psychiatrist.

22:27.246 --> 22:30.817
You mean, you told me
you were a countess
just to get my attention?

22:30.883 --> 22:33.986
-Yeah.
-Oh, I did that once myself.

22:34.053 --> 22:36.656
You told them
how you was a countess?

22:36.723 --> 22:39.726
Uh, no.
But I once told a woman
I was a British spy.

22:39.792 --> 22:42.662
Oh, I love to tell about
that night. It's one
of my favorite stories.

22:42.729 --> 22:44.397
Oh, yeah?
Well, why don't you
go to your apartment

22:44.464 --> 22:45.898
and tell it to yourself.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.366
I've already heard it.

22:51.438 --> 22:56.676
Florence, you mean you got
the idea about saying you
were a countess from a book?

22:56.743 --> 22:59.111
I'm afraid so, Miss Jefferson.

22:59.178 --> 23:02.281
Then there's nothing wrong
with you after all!

23:02.348 --> 23:05.117
(CHUCKLES)
I wouldn't say that.

23:05.184 --> 23:09.355
-George!
-I'm sorry I lied to you,
Greg.

23:09.422 --> 23:11.891
I just wanted you to think
I was interesting.

23:11.958 --> 23:16.395
Well, what made you think
you wouldn't be interesting
as the real Florence Johnston?

23:16.463 --> 23:20.667
Oh, come on, why would
a foxy dude like you
be interested in a maid?

23:20.733 --> 23:22.869
I had to do it
to get your attention.

23:22.935 --> 23:27.740
Well, to use the professional
term, Florence,
that is pure d-jive.

23:27.807 --> 23:30.643
-You wanna know
how to get my attention?
-How?

23:30.710 --> 23:32.411
Just be yourself.

23:32.479 --> 23:35.047
-That's all?
-That's all.

23:35.114 --> 23:38.184
I was attracted to you
the moment I saw you.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.819
You were attracted to me?

23:39.886 --> 23:43.556
That's right.
Not your address,
not your title, not your job.

23:43.623 --> 23:44.891
Just you.

23:46.959 --> 23:49.228
-Then you're not mad?
-No.

23:49.295 --> 23:52.098
But I will be if you don't go
to dinner with me tonight.

23:52.164 --> 23:56.335
Dinner?
Well, I don't know
what to say.
