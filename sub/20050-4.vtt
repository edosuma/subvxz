00:15.725 --> 00:17.936
Bubs, you hear
from Ricky?

00:18.018 --> 00:19.938
Not yet. I don't
know where he's at.

00:20.020 --> 00:22.064
For fuck's sakes, man.
We've got to get out there.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.482
The fucking
window's closing.

00:23.566 --> 00:25.109
Well, I don't think
the lobsters

00:25.192 --> 00:27.069
know how to pick
the locks on the
traps, Julian.

00:27.152 --> 00:29.071
They're not going anywhere.
What's all this shit for?

00:29.154 --> 00:31.407
Just some gear
we're going to need.
And look, I got...

00:31.490 --> 00:34.201
peanut butter and
bacon sandwiches!
Nice, nice, that's good.

00:34.285 --> 00:36.287
But all the rest of this
shit is not necessary, man.

00:36.370 --> 00:38.456
I've already got
it on my boat.

00:38.539 --> 00:41.166
Julian, never
underestimate the
power of the sea

00:41.250 --> 00:43.252
'cause the sea
will take you down.

00:43.335 --> 00:46.088
Jacques Cousteau, 1976.
Bubs, I already
have this stuff.

00:46.171 --> 00:47.715
It's going to get
in our fucking way.

00:47.799 --> 00:49.801
Oh, yeah? Well, tell
that to Gilligan, Julian.

00:49.884 --> 00:52.470
Tell that to fucking
Gilligan, going out
for three hours.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.013
All right...
Look what happened to him.

00:54.096 --> 00:55.389
Look... Look at me.

00:55.473 --> 00:58.017
You've got to lose
that fucking hat. Here.

00:58.100 --> 01:00.102
I'm not losing the hat.
The hat's cool.

01:00.185 --> 01:02.313
I look like one of
those souvenir guys
at Peggy's Cove.

01:02.396 --> 01:04.188
Exactly.
You look like a dick.

01:04.272 --> 01:06.275
Here's a real
fisherman's hat.
Put that on your head.

01:06.358 --> 01:08.319
That's a real
fisherman's hat, is it?
Yes, it is.

01:08.402 --> 01:10.029
Then how come nobody
on Deadliest Catch

01:10.112 --> 01:11.656
wears one of those
fucking things?

01:11.739 --> 01:13.825
Because they're all phoney
TV reality stars, man.

01:13.908 --> 01:15.451
They don't know what
the fuck they're doing.

01:15.534 --> 01:17.369
A boogie board?
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:17.453 --> 01:19.455
We might use the boogie
board... There he is.

01:21.749 --> 01:23.835
Julian:
What the fuck, man?
Where were you?

01:23.918 --> 01:26.504
I was down at the fucking
rink dealing with hockey
camp registration bullshit

01:26.587 --> 01:28.130
and parents asking about
Wayne fucking Gretzky

01:28.213 --> 01:30.842
and all the
other NHL dicks!
Ricky, out of respect

01:30.925 --> 01:33.052
to the greatest
fucking hockey player
to ever play the game,

01:33.135 --> 01:36.931
maybe you can't call him
Wayne fucking Gretzky.
Sorry, Bubs.

01:37.015 --> 01:39.099
All right, boys, we've got
to go. Come on! Let's go,
let's go, let's go!

01:39.183 --> 01:40.810
I'm fucking pumped, man.
I needed a day like this

01:40.893 --> 01:42.561
to clear my fucking head.
I know.

01:42.645 --> 01:44.689
Dad, we're ready to leave.
Huh?

01:44.772 --> 01:47.358
Hey, Motel! Grampy'll
be back in a little
while, all right?

01:47.441 --> 01:50.028
Grampy's going fishing.
High five!

01:50.110 --> 01:51.988
Uhh, what do you mean?
Boom!

01:52.071 --> 01:53.823
What do you mean?
You said you would
look after him today.

01:53.906 --> 01:55.700
No, I didn't, did I?
Yeah, you did.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.242
We asked you yesterday
and you said,

01:57.326 --> 01:59.037
and I quote, "It would
be my pleasure-ment."

01:59.119 --> 02:00.705
Seriously?
Un-huh.

02:00.788 --> 02:02.540
Okay, well I started
drinking early yesterday,

02:02.623 --> 02:04.416
and I smoked a lot of fucking
dope. I don't remember that.

02:04.500 --> 02:06.210
But, if I promised,
then... Sorry, boys.

02:06.293 --> 02:07.753
I'm a fucking
word of my man.

02:07.837 --> 02:10.214
Let's go, little buddy...
(Pained sigh)

02:10.297 --> 02:12.633
Will you please
fucking heal? It's been
a week already!

02:12.717 --> 02:16.387
Ricky, Ricky, sack
skin takes longer.
It's very tender.

02:16.470 --> 02:18.430
So this might
be for the best,
actually, you know,

02:18.514 --> 02:20.725
'cause if you're
down there hauling
heavy lobster traps,

02:20.808 --> 02:22.727
that thing could
blow apart again.

02:22.810 --> 02:25.229
You got spaghetti
and meatballs.

02:25.312 --> 02:26.689
Spaghetti and meatballs?

02:26.772 --> 02:28.440
All the noodle
stuff hanging out

02:28.524 --> 02:31.360
with your unit,
your meat marbles.
Okay, little buddy,

02:31.443 --> 02:33.445
even though it's your
fault that you shot
Grampy in the bag.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.907
We're going to have
a great little day today
hanging out, aren't we?

02:35.990 --> 02:37.742
Lots of helicopter
ri-i-ides...

02:37.825 --> 02:39.243
(Strained)
Oh, my fuck.

02:39.326 --> 02:41.203
(Growl)
I'm serious.

02:41.286 --> 02:42.747
If you don't
fucking heal,

02:42.830 --> 02:44.957
I'm cutting you off with
a bag-cutting chainsaw!!

02:45.041 --> 02:46.792
Fuck!

02:46.876 --> 02:49.503
(Theme music)

03:28.375 --> 03:30.669
Julian said that him
and Bubbles could handle
the lobster fishing

03:30.753 --> 03:32.463
and Jacob and Cory are
trending to the weed plants,

03:32.546 --> 03:34.465
so spending a nice relaxing
day with my gram-son

03:34.548 --> 03:37.426
is probably the
perfect thing to get
my ball sack all heal't.

03:37.509 --> 03:39.095
Isn't it, little buddy?
We're going to have fun today.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.848
Randy, what the
fuck are you doing?

03:42.932 --> 03:45.476
Give me that fucking
camera, Randy,
or I'm smashing it.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.645
It's just a phone, Ricky.
It's not a camera.
Fuck...

03:47.728 --> 03:49.730
Frig off!
Don't fucking
push me, Randy.

03:49.814 --> 03:52.316
Oh, are your nuts still
a little sore there,
you little baby?

03:52.399 --> 03:55.444
Only a moron blows his
balls off with fireworks.
Is that right?

03:55.527 --> 03:58.197
<i>Only a moron gets knocked
the fuck out before
he's told to fuck off!</i>

03:58.280 --> 04:00.032
Do you want to go?
All right, let's go!

04:00.116 --> 04:02.326
Randy, fuck off, Randy.
Come on.

04:02.409 --> 04:04.536
I'll make you look
like a little idiot in
front of your grandson.

04:04.620 --> 04:06.622
Fuck, you know what,
I don't care how
sore my nuts are.

04:06.705 --> 04:08.499
I'm punching you in the
fucking neck right now.
Oh, yeah?

04:08.582 --> 04:10.918
Ah, you fucking
dirty fucking prick!

04:11.002 --> 04:12.837
(Groaning)
Fuck!

04:12.920 --> 04:14.546
Take that, Ricky.
(Grunt)

04:14.630 --> 04:16.214
You fucking wait
till these get healed.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.634
You know where
to find me. Pussy!
Oh, fuck!

04:20.302 --> 04:22.554
(Groan)
It's okay, Motel.

04:22.638 --> 04:24.640
Grampy's nuts are mashed up
in his tummy but he's okay.

04:25.766 --> 04:27.351
Oh, fuck!

04:27.434 --> 04:28.769
My fucking balls!

04:32.148 --> 04:35.026
Randy's a fucking asshole,
isn't he, little buddy?

04:35.109 --> 04:36.318
(Groan)

04:39.947 --> 04:42.200
(Grunting)
That's it, man.

04:42.282 --> 04:45.244
(Straining)
This is going to be
a big one, buddy!

04:45.327 --> 04:47.913
(Exhaling)
Holy fuck!

04:47.997 --> 04:49.874
Come on, you cocksucker!

04:49.957 --> 04:51.876
Come on, put some
muscle into it.

04:51.959 --> 04:55.420
I'm putting fucking
muscle into it!
(Grunt)

04:55.504 --> 04:57.422
We got one!
Got another one!

04:57.506 --> 04:58.924
Bubs, it's tiny, man.

04:59.008 --> 05:00.551
You can get bigger
ones than that.

05:00.634 --> 05:02.053
Oh, pardon me!

05:02.136 --> 05:03.762
Who in the fuck
do you think

05:03.846 --> 05:05.556
pulled that big bastard
in earlier, huh?

05:05.639 --> 05:07.141
Okay, that was a nice one.

05:07.225 --> 05:08.726
You know what? I might
actually take him home

05:08.809 --> 05:10.936
and keep him in a little
tank next to my shed.

05:11.020 --> 05:13.814
You're not going to have
a pet lobster, man.
Oh, I think I am.

05:13.898 --> 05:16.067
And I think I'm going to
call him Little Julian.

05:16.150 --> 05:17.735
(Chuckling)
Funny.

05:17.818 --> 05:19.987
(In Conky voice)
♪ I had ♪

05:20.071 --> 05:22.406
♪ The time of my life ♪

05:22.489 --> 05:24.408
Bubs, put him in
the fucking ice.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.577
Give us a hug.
Put him in the fucking ice!

05:26.660 --> 05:28.746
Give us a little hug!
Bubs! Put him in
the fucking ice!

05:28.829 --> 05:30.414
(Cackle)

05:30.497 --> 05:32.750
Oh, come on.
It's just teasie-weasies.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.419
Fishing for lobsters
is hard fucking work,
believe me.

05:35.502 --> 05:37.421
You've got the weight
of the trap itself,

05:37.504 --> 05:39.590
then you've got 10, 15
pounds of lobsters in there

05:39.673 --> 05:41.884
coming from down
40, 50 feet.

05:41.967 --> 05:44.262
It's a fucking
workout, believe me.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.388
Julian makes it
look easy, though,

05:46.471 --> 05:49.600
'cause he's got those
great, big cartoon pipes
like the son of Thor.

05:49.683 --> 05:51.602
He just yanks
them right up.

05:51.685 --> 05:54.188
Who's ever seen somebody
haul a fucking lobster
trap with one arm?

05:55.773 --> 05:57.608
There's no lobster
in this one, man.

05:57.691 --> 05:59.944
Fuck.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.780
(Indistinct whisper)

06:02.863 --> 06:04.698
How's your cookie?

06:04.782 --> 06:06.617
Yummy.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.661
Hey, Rick. How's my
favourite little guy?

06:09.745 --> 06:11.622
Since when am I your
favourite little guy?

06:11.705 --> 06:13.791
I was talking to Mo.

06:13.874 --> 06:17.002
Hi, Mo. How's my
funny little guy?

06:17.086 --> 06:19.255
He really does
like you, Lahey.
I'll give you that.

06:19.338 --> 06:21.257
Yeah, well,
I like him a lot.

06:21.340 --> 06:23.175
Who would have thought,
one of my gram-kids
liking you.

06:23.259 --> 06:25.427
(Chuckle)
Yeah, who could
have imagined?

06:27.721 --> 06:30.099
Um, how you
doing anyway?

06:30.182 --> 06:32.101
Randy just told me
he beat you up.
Are you okay?

06:32.184 --> 06:33.769
He didn't fucking
beat me up!

06:33.852 --> 06:35.938
He knee-suckered me
in the ball-sack.

06:36.021 --> 06:38.232
I'm telling you, you
better tell him to chill out
on this cop-wannabe shit.

06:38.316 --> 06:40.025
It's driving me
fucking crazy.
Yeah, well...

06:40.109 --> 06:42.861
Ricky, about that...
Whoo...

06:42.945 --> 06:45.948
I heard a little rumour
about you and Julian.

06:46.031 --> 06:48.326
Oh, yeah?
Well, if it's true,

06:48.408 --> 06:51.578
and I hope it isn't,
my advice to you would be

06:51.662 --> 06:54.665
to move whatever it is
you're doing out
of the park right away.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.667
(Sniffing)
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

06:56.750 --> 06:59.878
All I'm saying is, uh,

06:59.962 --> 07:03.299
Randy is his own man
these days, as you know,

07:03.382 --> 07:05.926
and I can't control
him at all.

07:06.010 --> 07:08.929
So, if it is true,

07:09.013 --> 07:11.056
you better deal with it
sooner than later.

07:11.140 --> 07:12.891
Fuck's sakes.

07:12.975 --> 07:14.893
I'm not saying I'm
doing anything, but,

07:14.977 --> 07:16.937
If I was,
I wouldn't be able
to deal with it today.

07:17.021 --> 07:18.730
I've got Mo,
I've got to deal with
hockey camp bullshit.

07:18.814 --> 07:20.191
Well, jeez,

07:20.274 --> 07:22.401
I could take care of Mo
for a couple hours.

07:22.484 --> 07:24.362
But seriously,

07:24.444 --> 07:26.947
you've got to
handle this today.

07:27.031 --> 07:29.033
Oh, fuck. Are you serious?

07:29.116 --> 07:30.826
You don't mind watching him?

07:30.909 --> 07:33.371
Not at all.
You okay with
Mr. Lahey?

07:33.453 --> 07:35.247
Grampy's got to go deal
with a couple of things,
okay, little buddy?

07:35.331 --> 07:36.623
I'll be back
in a minute.

07:36.707 --> 07:38.709
(Groaning in pain)
Fuck!

07:40.127 --> 07:41.379
Ugh...

07:41.461 --> 07:43.588
Don't you pay any
attention to Grumpy.

07:43.672 --> 07:45.883
He's just a big pooper.

07:45.966 --> 07:47.885
(Ship horn blasting)
Oh, fuck! Get down!

07:47.968 --> 07:50.012
Man: What are you
doing with my traps?
What? Get down?

07:50.095 --> 07:51.889
You dirty
cocksuckers!
Julian: Get down!

07:51.972 --> 07:53.807
Bubbles:
Who's that? Hey, fellas!

07:53.891 --> 07:55.851
(Gunshots)
Bubbles:
Jesus Murphy!

07:57.561 --> 07:59.397
(Engine revving)
Julian:
Fuckers!

07:59.479 --> 08:02.233
What the fuck are
you doing, Julian?
Fuck you!

08:02.316 --> 08:03.942
(Gunshots)
Bubbles:
(Yelp)

08:05.694 --> 08:07.612
Who in the fuck is that?
Who are you firing at?

08:07.696 --> 08:09.531
Don't worry about it.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.742
What do you mean,
don't worry about it?
Who is it?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.245
It's the guys that
own the traps, man.

08:14.328 --> 08:16.580
What? These aren't
your fucking traps?

08:16.663 --> 08:18.332
Bubs, no, none
of them are, man.

08:18.416 --> 08:20.751
Do you know how much
a fucking lobster
licence costs?

08:20.834 --> 08:23.921
Oh, there's another
fucking greasy job
down to the résumé!

08:24.004 --> 08:26.590
"Bubbles, professional
lobster poacher!"

08:33.679 --> 08:35.182
You would think
after all these years

08:35.265 --> 08:37.101
you would have
learned from Jim Lahey

08:37.183 --> 08:39.102
this grudge with
Ricky and Julian is
just not worth it.

08:39.186 --> 08:41.145
It's a waste of time,
it's a waste of
taxpayer dollars.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.316
Sorry about the grease.

08:45.776 --> 08:47.445
As you can see,

08:47.527 --> 08:49.863
the whole crime family
starts with Ricky and Julian

08:49.947 --> 08:51.990
and grows down
and out like a tree.

08:52.074 --> 08:54.618
Almost everyone
in the park is growing
weed for them.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.162
A nice little high
school project you've
got going there, Randy.

08:57.246 --> 08:59.457
If you don't mind,
I have a lot of work to do.

08:59.539 --> 09:01.625
Yeah, yeah. Come on,
Randy. Let's not waste
Chief Green's time.

09:01.708 --> 09:03.001
This isn't a lot
of evidence.

09:03.085 --> 09:05.087
This isn't it.

09:05.170 --> 09:08.006
You didn't mention to
the chief all the video
evidence that I have.

09:08.090 --> 09:10.509
Hours of it, lots of
incriminating stuff,

09:10.592 --> 09:14.972
all filmed in HD 720p.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.723
Ugh... okay.

09:16.807 --> 09:18.934
You know, maybe...

09:19.017 --> 09:20.811
I forgot to
mention that.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.980
You know, maybe,
George, with this
evidence, maybe...

09:23.063 --> 09:25.107
you know, we should
look into it.

09:25.190 --> 09:27.651
Guys, I honestly
don't give a fuck.

09:27.734 --> 09:30.488
Do whatever you want!

09:30.570 --> 09:33.324
Thanks, Chief Green.
I won't let you down.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.951
I'll record every
step of the way.

09:37.828 --> 09:39.663
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck...

09:39.746 --> 09:42.291
Julian, answer your
fucking goddamn phone, man!

09:42.374 --> 09:45.169
<i>Recording:
The customer you are trying
to reach is out of range.</i>

09:45.252 --> 09:46.837
<i>Please try again later.</i>

09:46.920 --> 09:48.588
Why do you keep fucking
telling me this?

09:48.672 --> 09:50.508
I'm trying to get in range!
Help me the fuck out here!

09:50.590 --> 09:53.093
Hello, fuckbrains, answer me!

09:53.177 --> 09:56.388
Oh, fuck it!
NASA go fuck yourself!

09:56.472 --> 09:58.682
Oh, god damn it!

09:58.765 --> 10:00.100
(Growling)

10:02.936 --> 10:05.981
Fuck it! I have to fucking
do everything myself, I guess.

10:06.064 --> 10:08.400
(Engine struggling)

10:08.484 --> 10:10.735
Come on! Come on,
don't fuck with me today!

10:10.819 --> 10:12.904
I've got to get
this shit done!

10:12.988 --> 10:14.906
(Engine revving)

10:14.990 --> 10:17.742
Yeah, it sure is
peaceful out here, Julian.

10:17.826 --> 10:19.953
I mean, other than
the pissed off fishermen

10:20.037 --> 10:22.540
calling us dirty
cocksuckers.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.291
Yeah, I know
the schedule

10:24.375 --> 10:26.626
of almost every
fucking fisherman on
the eastern shore, bud.

10:26.710 --> 10:29.880
I worked under the table
for a lot of them for cash.

10:29.963 --> 10:31.673
Well, that's how you know
where all their traps are.

10:31.756 --> 10:34.051
That's fucking greasy.
Yeah, it's greasy,

10:34.134 --> 10:36.554
but it's a great
fucking supplement
to the income.

10:36.636 --> 10:38.263
I usually don't
have a problem, man.

10:38.347 --> 10:40.558
We just got out
too fucking late.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.726
(Engine slowing)

10:42.809 --> 10:44.644
Know what, man?

10:44.728 --> 10:47.064
Soon as I put this hat
on my head and I hopped
on board this boat,

10:47.147 --> 10:50.108
I knew I'd found
my calling, bud.

10:50.192 --> 10:52.694
My own boss, I make
all my own hours, man.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.739
All this beautiful nature and
shit, man, I fucking love it!

10:55.822 --> 10:58.492
Oh, it's fucking awesome.
Don't get me wrong, but...

10:58.576 --> 11:00.994
I mean, you could come
out here and do all this

11:01.078 --> 11:03.997
as much as you wanted to
anyway, even if you
lived at the park.

11:04.081 --> 11:06.250
I'd come with you whenever
you wanted to, Julian.

11:06.333 --> 11:08.419
I mean, you know...

11:08.502 --> 11:11.088
I love fishing
for these dirty
cocksuckers, you know.

11:11.171 --> 11:13.715
It's like you get
a tasty little reward
at the end of the day.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.717
Yeah, thank fuck I don't
like lobsters, man.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.886
I'd be eating
all my profits.

11:17.969 --> 11:20.305
What are we doing here?
Where are we? Is there...

11:20.389 --> 11:21.973
more traps out here?

11:22.057 --> 11:24.518
I just wanted
to show you this.

11:24.602 --> 11:28.230
What?
This, man. All this.

11:28.313 --> 11:31.233
What is it?
It's what I've been
working towards, man.

11:31.316 --> 11:34.361
All this cove right here,
it's all for sale.

11:34.445 --> 11:36.280
We could all move
out here, buddy.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.950
Think about it.
No more bullshit,
no more fucking jail.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.536
Your pizza sauce plant
can go right over there.

11:42.620 --> 11:44.162
See? That clearing.

11:44.246 --> 11:46.331
And then Ricky and his
trailer can go there.

11:46.415 --> 11:48.125
My fucking trailer can
go right over there.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.168
Your shed can go
right in between it.

11:50.252 --> 11:51.962
It's our future, man.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.506
Are you serious?
We could buy this
and live out here?

11:54.590 --> 11:57.342
You're fucking
right, we could.

11:57.426 --> 11:59.678
Oh my God,
you know what?

11:59.761 --> 12:02.347
This might be the
most beautiful thing
I've ever seen, Julian.

12:03.723 --> 12:05.100
I fucking love it, man.

12:06.560 --> 12:08.145
Do you think we
could take a selfie

12:08.228 --> 12:10.147
with that in the
background, you know?
Show it to Ricky.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.650
Fuck, yeah.

12:12.732 --> 12:14.818
We'll get the cove and
shit in the background

12:14.901 --> 12:16.820
Okay, here.
Let me get it cued up.

12:16.903 --> 12:18.322
Here, grab Little Julian.

12:18.405 --> 12:20.282
We don't need
Little fucking Julian.

12:20.365 --> 12:22.534
Come on, Julian.
He's family now.

12:22.618 --> 12:24.662
(Sigh)

12:24.744 --> 12:25.996
Fuck it...

12:27.956 --> 12:29.625
He's not going to be
fucking happy about this.

12:29.708 --> 12:31.042
No, he's clapping. Look.

12:31.126 --> 12:33.337
He's pissed off.
Say cheese, Little Julian.

12:38.175 --> 12:40.385
Decent.

12:40.469 --> 12:42.095
That's nice.

12:42.179 --> 12:45.223
Yeah, the lobster's
cool, man.

12:45.307 --> 12:48.018
Fuck phones and fuck NASA
and their shitty
fucking receptions

12:48.101 --> 12:50.979
and frequencies and whoever
the fuck I was talking to!

12:51.062 --> 12:53.398
I need soil, I need the
fucking plants moved...

12:53.482 --> 12:55.693
This is a goddamn shit-show!

12:55.775 --> 12:58.487
(Clicking)

12:58.570 --> 13:00.531
Seriously, you're going to
fuck with me too, are you?

13:00.614 --> 13:01.781
Well, fuck you!

13:06.786 --> 13:08.455
Oh, jeez... Thank fuck.

13:08.539 --> 13:11.208
Listen, man, I need a huge
fucking favour right now.

13:11.291 --> 13:13.293
Fuck, no, man,
it has to be right now!

13:13.377 --> 13:15.295
Like, how much weed's
it going to take
to make this happen?

13:19.216 --> 13:21.926
Julian:
Well, I hope to fuck
this works, man.

13:22.010 --> 13:25.889
Bubbles: Well, I mean,
you're bringing him some
fucking serious... lobsters.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.642
Everybody loves those
scrum-diddly bastards.

13:28.726 --> 13:30.810
Hello! Sonny!

13:30.894 --> 13:32.437
Anybody here?

13:32.521 --> 13:34.523
(Gun clicking)
What's going on out here?

13:34.606 --> 13:36.233
Oh, relax, man.
It's me, Julian.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.610
I got your lobsters.
Sonny:
Oh... oh!

13:38.694 --> 13:41.196
I actually got double
what I owe you, man, but...

13:41.279 --> 13:43.574
I need a favour.
Oh, what's that now?

13:43.657 --> 13:45.242
The guy down at the
hydroponics store

13:45.325 --> 13:47.911
said you bought
the last of that
Nuclear Bloom shit.

13:47.994 --> 13:50.414
We really need to
borrow some, man.
Like, bad.

13:50.497 --> 13:52.832
Well... yeah, yeah,
I got... I got some
I could give you,

13:52.916 --> 13:54.459
if you're in a jam.

13:54.543 --> 13:57.003
Oh, we're in a jam-eroo,
doodley-doo.

13:57.087 --> 13:59.590
If you help me get
out of a jam, that is.

13:59.673 --> 14:03.093
Yeah, what's...
what is it?

14:03.176 --> 14:04.636
Come on.

14:04.720 --> 14:06.930
Meet Big Ronnie.

14:07.013 --> 14:08.599
Those two mongoloids
you sent me

14:08.682 --> 14:10.267
didn't fill the
barrel to the rim

14:10.350 --> 14:12.310
and I've got to ship the
goods out in the morning.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.646
Huh? Now, he's got a big
pipe hanging off him,

14:14.730 --> 14:17.148
so you're going to
have to use two hands.

14:17.232 --> 14:19.401
Yeah, you've just
got to get a good
solid grip on her

14:19.484 --> 14:22.112
and he'll shoot
three or four times
if you keep going.

14:22.195 --> 14:25.156
But he is one
horny bastard.

14:25.240 --> 14:26.950
(Whispering)
Sweet merciful
Jesus, Julian.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.286
It's like a giant,
skin-covered tree-trunk.

14:29.369 --> 14:31.580
Isn't there a fucking
machine that can
do this, man?

14:31.663 --> 14:33.707
Oh, no, no.
These Japanese buyers

14:33.791 --> 14:35.626
are very particular
about their semen.

14:35.709 --> 14:37.795
We don't use machines,
we don't use lube.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.380
They want it all
organic. So, uh...

14:40.464 --> 14:42.048
(Spitting)
Spit.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.967
Spit's the only
thing you can use.

14:44.050 --> 14:45.510
(Whispering)
Oh, my fuck.

14:45.594 --> 14:49.139
I'll hold the bucket.
No fucking way!

14:49.222 --> 14:51.850
I think you should
just do what he said.
You need to get a good grip.

14:51.933 --> 14:54.227
Who's going to get
a better grip than you
with those big things.

14:54.311 --> 14:56.521
No, no, no. We're
at least doing rock,
paper, scissors.

14:56.605 --> 14:58.231
It's the fair
thing to do, man.

14:58.315 --> 14:59.858
That's what
friends would do.

14:59.941 --> 15:01.485
Put it up...
Put it up!

15:01.568 --> 15:03.612
(Sigh)

15:03.695 --> 15:04.988
Both:
One, two...

15:05.071 --> 15:09.993
(Pleasant music
playing on radio)

15:10.076 --> 15:11.703
It's a nice day
out today, huh?

15:11.787 --> 15:13.664
Yeah, gorgeous... day.

15:13.747 --> 15:15.373
It's supposed to be
just as nice tomorrow.

15:15.457 --> 15:17.292
Oh? I didn't hear that.

15:20.420 --> 15:22.172
Do you want a drink?

15:22.255 --> 15:24.341
No. We probably should
wash our hands, Julian,

15:24.424 --> 15:27.010
before we start putting
anything to our mouths.

15:27.093 --> 15:30.221
(Music on radio)

15:35.935 --> 15:37.061
Ah, fuck.

15:40.691 --> 15:42.818
All right, kids.
I want you to fill
the trunk with dirt.

15:42.901 --> 15:44.695
And we need a shit-ton,
so no fucking around.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.363
What the hell does this
have to do with hockey?

15:46.446 --> 15:48.573
Yeah, we paid a lot
of money for this.

15:48.657 --> 15:51.326
Did the Karate Kid ask
Mr. Jumanji why he had
to wax the fence? No.

15:51.409 --> 15:53.704
So do this and you'll be
catching flies with your
hockey sticks in no time

15:53.787 --> 15:55.372
just like that little
Mexican prick.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.749
You are really not
that bright, are you?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.585
<i>Can I help you?
Can I help you?</i>

16:00.669 --> 16:02.796
Fuck are you guys doing?
Are you fucking retarded?

16:02.880 --> 16:04.882
(Quietly)
Get over here!

16:04.964 --> 16:07.217
I'm not,
but they all are.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.220
And the politician correct
term is mental challenged
there, fuck brains!

16:10.303 --> 16:12.556
Look, I'm trying to
start a dumb garden

16:12.639 --> 16:14.307
and the guy from
the church said he'd
donate the dirt.

16:14.391 --> 16:16.393
They're trying to get
to the Special Olympics.

16:16.476 --> 16:18.228
Who said that? My dad?

16:18.311 --> 16:20.438
I don't know who it was.
One of their parents
was talking to somebody

16:20.522 --> 16:22.440
and that's what
he said, so...

16:22.524 --> 16:24.275
Anyway, look, this
guy's not very good
at shovelling.

16:24.359 --> 16:25.903
Can you give
him a hand here?

16:25.985 --> 16:27.571
It's not your
fault, bud.

16:27.654 --> 16:29.072
You just keep
fucking up.

16:29.155 --> 16:30.448
You'll get it.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.285
Bubs, what happened
was fucked

16:34.369 --> 16:35.871
but you've got to
suck it up, soldier!

16:35.954 --> 16:37.956
We've got the nutrients,
we're back on track

16:38.039 --> 16:41.919
and we're going
to be rich in 29
fucking days, man!

16:42.001 --> 16:45.839
Oh, yeah? Or we're going to
jail in 29 fucking seconds!

16:45.923 --> 16:48.425
(Sigh)
Fuck's sakes...

16:48.508 --> 16:50.802
(Truck door opening)

16:50.886 --> 16:53.096
Julian:
What the fuck is going on?

16:53.179 --> 16:55.766
21 separate grow-ops,
that's what the frig's
going on, tough guy!

16:55.849 --> 16:57.935
Hands on the car.
Come on, come on.
You know the drill.

16:58.017 --> 17:00.437
Bubs, hands on the car.
Julian, they're putting
Mo in here with us!

17:00.520 --> 17:02.272
What? Are you arresting
babies now, Randy?

17:02.355 --> 17:04.147
I'm arresting everyone
involved, Julian.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.733
Where's the search
warrant, Ted?
This is bullshit.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.193
George:
Warrants, you mean.

17:07.277 --> 17:09.153
21 of them. Right here.

17:09.237 --> 17:12.449
George! You're arresting
innocent people here,
for fuck's sake!

17:12.531 --> 17:15.076
Yeah, me included.
I didn't do a
fucking thing!

17:15.159 --> 17:18.454
I'm not arresting
anybody. Yet.

17:18.538 --> 17:21.916
Until we go through the
long process of sorting
through all this evidence,

17:22.000 --> 17:24.377
I have the right to
detain and question

17:24.461 --> 17:25.628
every fucking one of you.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.464
Including you
two scumbags.

17:27.547 --> 17:30.425
Pu the drink
down, Julian.

17:30.508 --> 17:32.719
Oh, Julian, just put
the fucking drink down.
We're in enough trouble!

17:32.803 --> 17:34.846
Don't try to be
Clint Eastwood here!

17:34.930 --> 17:37.515
If you want to question me,
you question me right
here, right now,

17:37.599 --> 17:39.517
because, unless you
put me under arrest,

17:39.601 --> 17:41.812
I'm not going anywhere.

17:41.895 --> 17:43.187
That's how you want
to play it, is it?

17:43.271 --> 17:44.940
What are we going
to do, Ted?

17:46.566 --> 17:49.068
(Laughter)
(Ice clinking)

17:49.152 --> 17:50.862
Well!

17:50.946 --> 17:52.906
That's assaulting
a police officer with
open liquor, bud.

17:52.990 --> 17:54.658
Gotta be fucking
kidding me.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.827
Take them away, boys!
What?

17:56.910 --> 17:58.996
Give us the drink.
No, no, no, no.
I'm innocent.

17:59.078 --> 18:01.456
Give me the glass...
How about I call
my fucking lawyer?

18:01.539 --> 18:04.334
Julian, just give him
the fucking glass!
Don't make it any harder.

18:04.417 --> 18:06.586
Fuck it!
Hands behind your back.

18:06.670 --> 18:07.879
Fuck off, Ted.

18:07.963 --> 18:09.506
I know how to get into
a goddamn police car.

18:11.090 --> 18:12.383
You, hands behind your back.

18:12.467 --> 18:14.344
I can do it, Ted.
I can do it.

18:14.427 --> 18:16.847
I've done it many
fucking times!
All right, guys.

18:16.930 --> 18:18.723
Start with
this shit-hole.

18:18.807 --> 18:20.058
With pleasure, sir.

18:22.101 --> 18:23.895
What the hell's going
on here, George?

18:25.146 --> 18:28.025
Heh. Ask your
partner here.

18:28.107 --> 18:30.068
Maybe he can teach
you a few things

18:30.151 --> 18:32.278
about gathering something
you just never seem
to be able to get, Jim.

18:32.362 --> 18:34.364
Evidence.

18:34.447 --> 18:36.867
I was a better
officer than you'll
ever be, George!

18:36.950 --> 18:39.870
How the dumbest...
"Officer"?

18:39.953 --> 18:42.580
See these stripes
on my arm, Jim?

18:42.664 --> 18:44.541
I am the Chief.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.877
These stripes mean
I can do whatever
the hell I want.

18:46.960 --> 18:48.712
(Chuckle)
I earned them.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.964
So, if you don't want
to get taken in,

18:51.048 --> 18:53.383
I suggest you walk
the fuck away.

18:55.343 --> 18:57.303
Pretty nice police
work there, Randy.

18:57.387 --> 18:58.722
I really thought
for a while

18:58.805 --> 19:00.557
you were probably
wasting our time but...

19:00.640 --> 19:01.933
nice job.

19:02.017 --> 19:03.560
Thanks.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.395
Man:
Hey, Chief!

19:05.478 --> 19:07.146
Lots of grow equipment.

19:07.230 --> 19:09.482
No plants, though.

19:09.566 --> 19:10.942
(Sigh)

19:11.026 --> 19:12.610
Nice job, Randy.

19:12.694 --> 19:14.112
This is just
one trailer.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.822
There's 20 more
with lots of plants.

19:15.906 --> 19:17.490
I've got
video evidence.

19:21.327 --> 19:23.580
Boy: (Whispering)
Stupid fucking hockey school.

19:28.043 --> 19:30.045
Excuse me.
Yeah?

19:30.128 --> 19:32.589
Can you tell me
why my children are
so covered in dirt

19:32.672 --> 19:34.883
and exhausted
from shovelling and
running all day?

19:34.966 --> 19:36.760
This is supposed to
be a hockey school.

19:36.843 --> 19:40.097
It is. Today was the ground
strength training day.

19:40.179 --> 19:43.767
Ground strength training day?
They're supposed to be
playing hockey.

19:43.850 --> 19:46.394
No, they're supposed to be
learning how to play hockey.
It's a hockey camp, dummy.

19:46.477 --> 19:48.521
If you don't like the way
I'm running things around
here, take your kid,

19:48.605 --> 19:50.440
fuck off and don't come back.
I don't give a fuck.

19:52.067 --> 19:54.027
Why don't you eat my dick?

19:54.111 --> 19:55.653
Why don't you finger me?

19:55.737 --> 19:57.614
Well... maybe I will.

19:57.697 --> 19:59.116
All right, great.
Good.

19:59.198 --> 20:00.533
Thanks for coming out.

20:00.617 --> 20:01.993
(Engine ignition)

20:02.077 --> 20:06.957
(Electronic music
blasting on car stereo)

20:09.375 --> 20:11.628
Right on, boys.
Holy fuck!

20:11.711 --> 20:13.838
What's up, man?
You're gonna owe us
big for this one, G.

20:13.922 --> 20:15.924
No fucking kidding.
I hope Lahey wasn't
fucking with me.

20:16.007 --> 20:18.509
No, man. Five-O was
just rollin' in as
we was leavin'.

20:18.593 --> 20:20.553
<i>A whole bunch of them, too.
Are you fucking serious?</i>

20:20.637 --> 20:22.013
Dead serious.

20:22.097 --> 20:24.265
Fucking Randy,
the cop wannabe idiot!

20:24.348 --> 20:26.350
It feels good to fuck
him over though, boys.
That's what I'm saying.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.812
Right on. Grab the
rest of the plants
and meet me inside.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.858
I must say that I'm
pretty proud of myself.

20:33.942 --> 20:36.153
Chief Green said that
he wanted to talk to me.

20:36.235 --> 20:38.571
I hope it's about
my acceptance into
the police academy.

20:38.655 --> 20:40.991
I'm keeping my fingers crossed.

20:41.074 --> 20:42.659
(Knocking on door)
Chief?

20:42.742 --> 20:44.452
George:
Get the fuck in here, Randy.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.999
Sit your ass down.

20:52.002 --> 20:54.045
So...

20:54.129 --> 20:56.339
Ted's telling me
you're looking to get
into the academy.

20:56.422 --> 20:58.299
Yes, sir. I was hoping
that after the bust today,

20:58.382 --> 21:00.343
you'd give me a
recommendation.

21:00.426 --> 21:02.553
Do you know what I was
hoping for, Randy?

21:02.637 --> 21:04.973
I was hoping
you weren't as dumb
as your boyfriend.

21:05.056 --> 21:06.891
But I should have
known better.

21:06.975 --> 21:09.060
I should have realized

21:09.144 --> 21:11.062
that when a person
learns everything they
know about detective work

21:11.146 --> 21:13.523
from a drunk trailer
park supervisor

21:13.606 --> 21:16.693
who's quite possibly
the shittiest cop to ever
put on a police uniform,

21:16.776 --> 21:18.611
that that person is
going to fuck things up.

21:18.695 --> 21:20.155
Sir?

21:20.238 --> 21:21.739
We've got nothing!

21:21.823 --> 21:23.616
What about all
the grow equipment,

21:23.700 --> 21:25.952
all the video evidence
I documented?

21:26.036 --> 21:28.371
Do you have any idea

21:28.454 --> 21:31.708
the amount of bullshit
I have to deal with
now because of you?

21:31.791 --> 21:34.627
Don't you ever
set foot in this
building again

21:34.711 --> 21:37.881
or for as long as
I'm the police chief
of this station!

21:37.964 --> 21:40.175
(Yelling)
Do I make myself clear?

21:40.258 --> 21:42.385
(Whimpering)
Yes, sir.
Good!

21:42.468 --> 21:44.554
Now get the fuck
out of my office!

21:46.556 --> 21:48.892
I can't believe how much
time we wasted on you.

21:48.975 --> 21:51.102
Get out!
(Glass shattering)

21:51.186 --> 21:53.063
Damn idiot! Fuck!

21:55.940 --> 21:57.901
Ricky:
(Incredulous laughter)

21:57.984 --> 21:59.861
Fucking Jesus!

21:59.944 --> 22:02.072
The cocksuckers didn't
have to smash all
the fucking equipment!

22:02.155 --> 22:04.074
What happened?

22:04.157 --> 22:05.909
There's nothing
illegal, eh?

22:05.992 --> 22:08.327
I had to hide in
my goddamn closet!

22:08.411 --> 22:10.080
What the fuck are
you talking about?

22:10.163 --> 22:12.249
George Green and
his fucking goons.

22:12.331 --> 22:15.252
They came flying
in here and arrested
everybody in sight!

22:15.334 --> 22:17.128
And it's all
because of you,

22:17.212 --> 22:20.257
you braindead
cocksucker!

22:20.339 --> 22:21.758
Motherfucker!

22:21.841 --> 22:23.760
Don't be throwing shit
on my fucking car!

22:23.843 --> 22:26.304
(Clattering)

22:26.387 --> 22:27.555
Fuck!

22:28.890 --> 22:30.516
(Tires skidding on gravel)

22:31.935 --> 22:34.271
Fuck... Hey!

22:34.353 --> 22:36.355
What the fuck did you do?

22:36.439 --> 22:37.815
There was no plants.
We got rid of them.

22:37.899 --> 22:40.443
I know! I know!

22:40.526 --> 22:42.279
They didn't care!

22:42.361 --> 22:44.322
They even took Mo!

22:44.405 --> 22:46.616
I thought you were
fucking cool warning me,

22:46.699 --> 22:48.159
but no! You fucked me!

22:48.243 --> 22:50.036
(Grunting)
Ricky...

22:50.120 --> 22:52.872
you can't honestly
believe that I had
anything to do with it!

22:52.956 --> 22:54.540
They even took Mo away!

22:54.624 --> 22:57.127
You know how I feel
about that little guy!

22:57.210 --> 22:59.129
You put my family in jail,
you son of a bitch!

22:59.212 --> 23:00.630
My fucking gram-son!

23:00.713 --> 23:02.465
Things are different
now, Ricky!

23:02.548 --> 23:04.383
I'm sorry about
hurting your family!

23:04.467 --> 23:07.137
I promise I'll never
fucking do it again, bud!

23:07.220 --> 23:09.806
Listen! Ricky!

23:09.889 --> 23:11.515
Listen, Rick.

23:11.599 --> 23:13.643
I'm sorry about
what I did to you,

23:13.726 --> 23:16.229
and to Ray, and to
your fucking mother!

23:18.481 --> 23:20.275
My mother?

23:20.358 --> 23:22.652
Why the fuck are you
talking about my mom?

23:22.735 --> 23:25.322
Rick!

23:25.404 --> 23:28.325
It's useless
to resist, Rick.

23:28.407 --> 23:30.534
Don't let yourself be
destroyed like Ray did.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.332
What the fuck are
you talking about?

23:35.414 --> 23:38.584
(Fighting grunts)

23:38.668 --> 23:40.837
(Loud clack)
Fuck!

23:40.920 --> 23:44.423
I think you just
broke my hand,
you fucking idiot!

23:44.507 --> 23:47.218
What's happened
to you, Ricky?

23:47.302 --> 23:49.012
Don't make me
destroy you.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.513
Destroy me?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.852
Rick...

23:55.935 --> 23:57.687
save yourself.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.730
Join me.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.066
Help me to run Sunnyvale.

24:02.150 --> 24:05.111
You have no idea
the power we'd have.

24:05.195 --> 24:07.238
With our combined strengths

24:07.322 --> 24:09.199
we could end
the bullshit

24:09.282 --> 24:11.450
and we could bring
order to Sunnyvale!

24:11.534 --> 24:13.036
What the fuck are
you talking about?

24:13.119 --> 24:14.537
I will never join you!

24:14.620 --> 24:16.206
Ray never told you

24:16.289 --> 24:18.041
what happened to
your mother, did he?

24:18.124 --> 24:19.625
Yes, he did.
He told me enough.

24:19.709 --> 24:21.211
He told me the reason
she left Sunnyvale

24:21.294 --> 24:22.879
is because you were being
such a fucking asshole!

24:22.962 --> 24:24.297
That's a lie!

24:26.216 --> 24:27.466
Ricky...

24:29.802 --> 24:32.638
I am your father.

24:35.808 --> 24:38.728
No... No!

24:38.811 --> 24:41.605
That's not true.
That's impossible!

24:41.689 --> 24:44.234
Search your feelings.

24:44.317 --> 24:47.570
You know it's the truth.

24:47.653 --> 24:49.655
No-o-o-o!

24:49.739 --> 24:51.366
No!

24:56.996 --> 24:58.164
(Thud)

24:59.249 --> 25:02.252
(Theme music)

25:44.210 --> 25:46.212
(Seabirds squawking)

25:58.641 --> 26:02.395
Fish:
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

26:02.479 --> 26:05.231
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

26:09.152 --> 26:10.445
<i>(Whisper)
Fuck.</i>

26:10.528 --> 26:12.780
<i>(Light clicks off)
Fuck off.</i>
