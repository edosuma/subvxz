00:13.096 --> 00:15.656
- Mr. Jones.
- Mr. Kohl.

00:17.333 --> 00:21.531
I have the appeal request
all prepared and ready to go.

00:22.138 --> 00:24.470
It goes without saying
the German government...

00:24.641 --> 00:26.131
...are not big fans of yours.

00:26.576 --> 00:30.034
You did, after all, steal state secrets.

00:30.213 --> 00:33.740
I think that the best
we can hope for is life.

00:36.052 --> 00:40.751
Now, all I need is your signature.

02:19.355 --> 02:20.879
- Hey.
- Morning.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.888
- Is your father about?
- Right here.

02:23.059 --> 02:25.118
Why don't you ask him
what he's doing?

02:25.995 --> 02:27.929
I'd rather not.

02:28.164 --> 02:30.826
Do you remember that prisoner,
Jones, I went to see in...?

02:31.000 --> 02:32.524
- In Germany, right?
- He escaped.

02:32.702 --> 02:35.603
- Good for him. How?
- Nobody knows. It makes no sense.

02:35.772 --> 02:38.206
The German authorities
came to see me last night.

02:38.374 --> 02:41.241
How come when it doesn't make sense,
they come to us?

02:41.411 --> 02:44.380
What we do know is Jones
was working with Mitchel Loeb.

02:44.547 --> 02:47.948
I remember Loeb. That's
the guy that stole my invention.

02:48.151 --> 02:49.914
Yeah. I'm gonna go talk to him now.

02:50.086 --> 02:53.055
Can you describe to me what you made?
What Loeb was stealing?

02:53.223 --> 02:55.282
Why don't you tell her
the truth this time?

02:55.458 --> 02:57.255
He kind of sugarcoated it last time.

02:57.427 --> 03:01.955
You did? Why? Is it something
that could have helped Jones escape?

03:02.799 --> 03:05.029
It was a transportation device.

03:05.201 --> 03:06.463
I called it Dizray...

03:06.669 --> 03:10.537
...coined based on the premise
disintegration, reintegration.

03:10.707 --> 03:11.901
"Dis," "re," Dizray.

03:12.075 --> 03:15.101
- Are you saying you created...?
- A teleportation system. Yeah.

03:15.278 --> 03:19.044
Except for this one's meant to travel
through time. How's that?

03:19.215 --> 03:22.480
Assuming someone could solve
the considerable problems.

03:22.685 --> 03:25.711
Coming through, arriving,
would require...

03:25.889 --> 03:28.221
...weeks of decompression
in a barometric tank.

03:28.391 --> 03:29.983
And if you survived that...

03:30.193 --> 03:33.492
...based on what would happen next,
you'd likely wish you hadn't.

03:33.696 --> 03:37.632
So you're saying that Jones, in theory,
could have zapped himself out of prison.

03:37.800 --> 03:40.325
Uh... Yes.

03:45.241 --> 03:48.938
Equilibrium's been reached.
Decompression is complete.

04:07.664 --> 04:09.791
Welcome back, sir.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.797
- Cup of tea, please.
- Of course.

04:15.972 --> 04:20.704
Firstly, I'd like to thank you
for the work you've done...

04:20.877 --> 04:23.107
...for bringing me here.

04:23.279 --> 04:26.806
I understand
there have been sacrifices.

04:26.983 --> 04:32.250
I am grateful to them, as I am to you.

04:33.022 --> 04:36.219
- Everything is in order, then?
- Yes, sir. The list is complete.

04:36.392 --> 04:38.690
We've got a lab
set to your specifications.

04:38.861 --> 04:41.523
- And the sealant?
- All parts.

04:41.698 --> 04:43.393
Good.

04:52.175 --> 04:56.544
You know, it's not a library here,
and I don't make loans.

04:59.816 --> 05:01.579
Seventy-five cents, my friend.

05:01.784 --> 05:04.082
Of course, it's old news now,
given the Internet.

05:04.287 --> 05:06.312
You must be
a traditionalist like myself.

05:06.489 --> 05:10.391
Hey, hey, hey, I like these.
You don't see the 2-dollar very often.

05:13.930 --> 05:16.023
Thanks. I'll keep it.

05:16.199 --> 05:19.225
Okay, so, Tommie, you were right.

05:19.402 --> 05:22.166
- Yeah, you see that Grace Kelly?
- She was good.

05:22.338 --> 05:24.033
But Jimmy Stewart was better.

05:24.207 --> 05:26.368
I'm creating cinephiles
one reader at a time.

05:26.542 --> 05:29.534
Now, listen, I want you to check out
a movie called Charade.

05:29.712 --> 05:31.737
- Ever seen it?
- Never heard of it.

05:31.914 --> 05:34.610
Oh. Oh, God.

05:34.784 --> 05:36.251
Oh. Oh.

05:37.620 --> 05:39.986
Oh. Heh.

05:40.156 --> 05:43.557
- I guess there's something in my eyes.
- You okay?

05:44.093 --> 05:45.560
I...

05:46.729 --> 05:47.753
Oh...

05:47.930 --> 05:50.091
- Oh, God.
- Tommie, you okay?

05:50.266 --> 05:52.496
My eyes. Oh!

05:55.538 --> 05:56.869
Oh, my God!

05:57.640 --> 06:00.575
Tommie! Tommie!

06:02.845 --> 06:04.745
Someone!

06:06.849 --> 06:07.975
Call an ambulance!

06:08.851 --> 06:10.113
He can't breathe!

06:10.286 --> 06:13.847
- Someone help! He can't breathe!
- Someone call an ambulance!

06:26.636 --> 06:29.662
- Anything yet?
- We might be on to something.

06:29.839 --> 06:31.238
Nothing local on Jones...

06:31.407 --> 06:36.470
...but found some financial records
for Salman Kohl, Jones' attorney.

06:36.646 --> 06:40.047
- The man found dead in Jones' cell.
- He kept a slush fund maintained...

06:40.216 --> 06:43.208
...under an assumed name.
- Could be a mistress.

06:43.386 --> 06:46.412
Or something less salacious,
more interesting.

06:46.589 --> 06:49.524
Let me know
if you find something useful.

07:14.350 --> 07:15.612
Let's go.

07:24.961 --> 07:27.191
I know about David Robert Jones.

07:28.764 --> 07:30.698
I know that you helped him escape...

07:30.867 --> 07:33.563
...and that you kidnapped me
on that same night.

07:33.736 --> 07:34.964
You know where Jones is.

07:37.940 --> 07:42.138
You're not someone
I really wanna work with.

07:48.718 --> 07:54.156
Your transfer order
to Wallens Ridge State Prison.

07:58.895 --> 08:01.386
You know what that place
is like, Mitchel?

08:02.899 --> 08:06.960
You know what they're gonna do to you,
what it's gonna be like that first night?

08:07.136 --> 08:10.401
- The second?
- Doesn't matter if you find Jones or not.

08:10.940 --> 08:12.567
He's just a part of the army.

08:15.378 --> 08:20.975
What was written will come to pass,
and nothing you do can stop that.

08:24.487 --> 08:26.079
Nothing.

08:37.265 --> 08:38.357
Agent Dunham.

08:38.534 --> 08:41.469
It's me. Get the Bishops
and meet me at Boston General.

08:46.275 --> 08:48.869
Name's Thomas Avery.
Runs a newsstand downtown.

08:49.045 --> 08:52.173
His prior conditions were
high cholesterol and a weak bladder.

08:52.348 --> 08:54.839
The whole thing happened
in less than two minutes.

08:55.017 --> 08:58.953
Ceramides. Act as a signaling molecule
in the skin.

08:59.121 --> 09:02.113
They control how the cells grow
and differentiate.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.656
Two thoughts come to mind.

09:03.826 --> 09:08.661
The first, that this affliction
might have been caused by a mutation...

09:08.831 --> 09:12.892
...changing these lipids to recognize
and seal any and all orifices.

09:13.069 --> 09:15.230
Did they check his anus and penis?

09:15.438 --> 09:18.168
You think we could get the answer
without me in the room?

09:18.341 --> 09:20.172
What was the other thought?

09:20.676 --> 09:23.008
- Sorry?
- You said two thoughts came to mind.

09:23.212 --> 09:26.704
Oh, yes. The other was...

09:28.050 --> 09:31.884
...coffee cake.
Tiny pebbles of cinnamon sugar.

09:34.056 --> 09:36.388
Once again, my father.

09:36.993 --> 09:40.360
- You know what this is.
- You think Jones?

09:40.529 --> 09:42.588
Peter, help me with this.

09:45.534 --> 09:49.026
You talked to Loeb.
Did he give you anything?

09:49.205 --> 09:51.571
Maybe. But nothing
that relates to this, exactly.

09:51.741 --> 09:55.074
I'm not convinced this is Jones' work.
What interest would he have...

09:55.244 --> 09:58.236
...in a newsstand operator?
- That's what we're gonna find out.

09:58.414 --> 10:00.712
Peter. You got a sec?

10:00.883 --> 10:02.544
When I saw Loeb, he said something:

10:02.718 --> 10:04.447
Jones was doing what had been written.

10:04.620 --> 10:07.111
- Meaning what? Written where?
- Well, I didn't know.

10:07.290 --> 10:10.782
We've never known
what Jones' group, ZFT, stood for.

10:10.993 --> 10:13.257
Maybe it's not the name
of their organization.

10:13.429 --> 10:16.626
- What if it's the name of their bible?
- Interesting.

10:16.799 --> 10:19.063
I called a contact
at the German authorities...

10:19.235 --> 10:22.227
...asked him to search
any known document with those initials.

10:22.405 --> 10:26.501
- Did he find anything?
- Yes, he did.

10:29.378 --> 10:31.573
- ZFT.
- ZFT. Scroll down.

10:31.747 --> 10:33.806
"Destruction by Advancement
of Technology."

10:34.016 --> 10:36.109
It's a self-published,
anonymous manuscript.

10:36.285 --> 10:39.448
On their records because
it was recovered as evidence in a raid...

10:39.622 --> 10:41.954
...in an unrelated case.
- They sending it to us?

10:42.124 --> 10:44.786
They would be if it hadn't been
destroyed 10 years ago.

10:44.960 --> 10:49.454
So I was hoping that
you might have one of your...

10:51.400 --> 10:53.231
...weird connections.

10:53.402 --> 10:54.630
Weird connections.

10:55.738 --> 10:59.401
- They're always a little weird.
- Well, you're always a little weird.

10:59.809 --> 11:01.572
What do you think?

11:02.144 --> 11:03.839
Come on.

11:04.914 --> 11:07.075
I think I got a weird connection.

11:09.318 --> 11:10.512
Is he contagious?

11:10.686 --> 11:16.147
If he were contagious, we'd have
several more orificeless bodies by now.

11:16.325 --> 11:18.520
Scalpel, please, and an empty IV bag.

11:18.694 --> 11:21.356
Empty IV bag?
What exactly are we doing here?

11:21.797 --> 11:23.765
The obvious:

11:23.933 --> 11:25.992
Searching for evidence.

11:26.168 --> 11:29.604
Any scientific clue
to reveal what caused...

11:29.772 --> 11:35.108
...this hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil,
see-no-evil malady.

11:35.277 --> 11:39.213
The gas trapped within his body
may yield important information.

11:40.750 --> 11:42.980
Worth the study.

11:47.256 --> 11:50.453
Oh, dear God. That is putrid.

11:51.894 --> 11:54.089
On a separate topic,
do you like coffee cake?

11:57.700 --> 11:59.133
Take a look at this.

11:59.301 --> 12:01.496
I know someone at the SEC.

12:01.670 --> 12:04.332
I had her send a list of every business
Jones' lawyer...

12:04.507 --> 12:06.338
...has incorporated for his clients.

12:06.509 --> 12:10.502
Figure maybe one or more of them
were used to funnel cash to the ZFT.

12:10.679 --> 12:13.512
This is all protected
by lawyer-client privilege.

12:13.682 --> 12:18.210
- How did you get her to break that?
- We dated in college.

12:18.387 --> 12:19.979
And she dumped me. Bad.

12:20.156 --> 12:22.488
So I told her she owed me one.
Heh-heh-heh.

12:24.927 --> 12:28.886
I narrowed down the list
to U.S. addresses only.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.667
Good work.

12:32.935 --> 12:36.701
It's no First Folio. Some tanning.
Pretty badly shelf-cocked.

12:36.872 --> 12:39.602
- I can give you 40 for it.
- Okay.

12:39.775 --> 12:41.902
You don't wanna make that deal.

12:44.280 --> 12:46.145
First-edition Land of Laughs?

12:48.184 --> 12:51.415
No matter what condition it's in,
it's worth at least twice that.

12:52.521 --> 12:53.818
Mm.

12:57.793 --> 13:00.421
- Thanks.
- Have a great day.

13:00.796 --> 13:02.195
Is that really necessary?

13:02.364 --> 13:04.594
You know me, Markham.
Friend of the people.

13:04.767 --> 13:07.099
What about me? Aren't I people?

13:07.269 --> 13:09.760
- People who shower.
- Oh.

13:09.939 --> 13:12.533
- Who's this friend?
- Olivia Dunham.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.643
Five dollars I can name
at least one item on your nightstand.

13:15.811 --> 13:20.305
Don't tell me. You're gonna like this.
I'm never wrong. It's a gift.

13:20.483 --> 13:23.611
Okay, Toni Morrison novel,
something by Obama...

13:23.786 --> 13:26.482
...and/or the current issue
of Bon Appetit.

13:28.090 --> 13:30.490
I'm reading Advanced Forensic Science
by Annemann.

13:30.693 --> 13:32.251
I keep it next to my gun.

13:32.461 --> 13:34.827
Oh. I like this one.

13:34.997 --> 13:37.591
This one's just a friend,
and we need a favor.

13:37.967 --> 13:39.798
Anonymous, self-published manuscript.

13:40.402 --> 13:43.235
Uh... "Destruction by
Advancement of Technology."

13:43.405 --> 13:46.340
- Sounds sexy and very challenging.
- Peter says you're good.

13:46.509 --> 13:49.410
Well, he also says
that you're just a friend, so...

13:49.845 --> 13:53.303
- The book, Markham. We need it.
- Today, right?

13:54.283 --> 13:56.911
Right. Impress me.

13:57.086 --> 13:59.486
Nothing interests me less
than impressing you.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.425
I think I may have something.

14:07.596 --> 14:11.327
Warehouse building in Austin
leased to Jones' attorney.

14:11.500 --> 14:15.266
Power was cut off for months.
Two weeks ago, it was turned back on.

14:15.437 --> 14:18.304
- The day Jones escaped from prison.
- Could be a safe house.

14:21.877 --> 14:24.368
This is Broyles.
I need a search warrant authorized.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.640
- Sir?
- Yeah, a warehouse in Austin...

14:26.815 --> 14:28.612
- Sir, this can't wait.
- What is it?

14:28.784 --> 14:32.117
There's a man downstairs,
says his name is David Robert Jones.

14:34.390 --> 14:36.290
Everybody down.

14:36.492 --> 14:38.619
- Down, down, down!
- Don't move!

14:39.628 --> 14:42.392
- Jones.
- Freeze!

14:48.904 --> 14:52.169
I will speak
only with Agent Olivia Dunham.

14:59.248 --> 15:03.116
- And he just turned himself in.
- Two hours ago.

15:03.285 --> 15:06.277
Said he'd only speak to Agent Dunham.
Hasn't said a word since.

15:06.455 --> 15:09.754
Anything else? Anything on how
he escaped from prison?

15:09.925 --> 15:12.553
No information.
Just another question.

15:12.728 --> 15:14.093
- A key.
- What key?

15:14.263 --> 15:16.128
Found on him
when he turned himself in.

15:16.298 --> 15:18.630
No markings on it.
Forensics is doing their thing.

15:18.801 --> 15:22.293
- He wanted us to find it.
- He wants to talk to me. Let me in there.

15:22.471 --> 15:24.200
Jones doesn't dictate the terms.

15:24.373 --> 15:26.933
He wouldn't be a captive
if it wasn't under his terms.

15:27.109 --> 15:28.906
Jones is here because he wants to be.

15:29.078 --> 15:31.706
The United States
doesn't negotiate with terrorists.

15:31.880 --> 15:34.371
That's exactly the kind of arrogance
he's expecting.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.211
- What?
- The man was clever enough...

15:36.385 --> 15:39.548
...to Star Trek himself out of a
maximum-security German prison...

15:39.722 --> 15:43.488
...elude Interpol, arrive in Boston,
and get himself apprehended...

15:43.692 --> 15:47.719
...simply because he liked the idea.
He's expecting us to reject his request.

15:47.896 --> 15:49.989
And your choice?
Give Jones what he wants...

15:50.199 --> 15:52.258
...to demonstrate
we can be anti-dogmatic?

15:52.434 --> 15:54.766
I don't think that's
what you're saying, is it?

15:54.937 --> 15:58.065
Since he arrived in town,
a man was killed in a gruesome way.

15:58.240 --> 16:01.141
- We don't know that was Jones.
- It was. He has more planned.

16:01.310 --> 16:04.279
- And you know that how?
- I don't know how to justify a hunch.

16:04.446 --> 16:06.641
- I don't see...
- This isn't a gentlemen's club.

16:06.815 --> 16:09.079
Mr. Jones doesn't get to choose
the pretty one.

16:09.251 --> 16:11.185
Wanna get him to talk?
Join the raid...

16:11.353 --> 16:13.844
...on that warehouse in Austin.
See what you find.

16:14.023 --> 16:15.354
- How is that...?
- Relevant?

16:15.524 --> 16:18.618
Well, because right now,
he's just an escaped prisoner.

16:18.794 --> 16:23.197
But if he's playing games, as you say,
I doubt he's here to help us.

16:23.365 --> 16:25.356
Show me some evidence
that connects him...

16:25.534 --> 16:27.468
...to that incident downtown.

16:36.045 --> 16:39.105
- Agent Dunham.
- I got it. The ZFT book.

16:39.281 --> 16:40.475
Stop it. Already?

16:40.649 --> 16:44.551
Markham found some guy who collects
scientific ephemera, he had a copy.

16:44.753 --> 16:48.519
The thing was never published. It was
never even proofed, but check this out.

16:48.691 --> 16:52.991
"The advances of science, which is
supposed to expand our knowledge...

16:53.162 --> 16:57.531
...will, if not carefully controlled,
destroy the world as we know it."

16:57.700 --> 17:00.464
- So it's light reading.
- Wait, it gets better.

17:00.636 --> 17:02.365
"Our technological ambitions...

17:02.538 --> 17:05.371
...have not only driven us
to the brink of catastrophe...

17:05.540 --> 17:08.169
...the catastrophe has already begun.

17:08.343 --> 17:10.071
What will the apocalypse look like?

17:10.279 --> 17:12.645
The answer,
to use a term generally understood...

17:12.815 --> 17:14.976
...the specifics of which
you can't imagine...

17:15.150 --> 17:17.550
...which this document
will attempt to describe...

17:17.720 --> 17:19.153
...is warfare."

17:19.320 --> 17:22.050
- And that's just the foreword.
- Well, keep reading.

17:22.290 --> 17:23.848
Will do. Where you headed?

17:24.026 --> 17:27.723
We're going to raid a building
that we think may be a safe house.

17:41.176 --> 17:43.167
- Alpha team clear.
- Bravo clear.

17:43.345 --> 17:45.540
- Delta clear.
- Echo clear.

17:46.749 --> 17:47.977
We're clear.

17:58.360 --> 17:59.793
What is it?

17:59.962 --> 18:03.090
It's me. He was here.

18:05.234 --> 18:09.364
I want everything bagged and tagged.
Move fast.

18:38.967 --> 18:41.162
I'd like to ask you some questions.

18:42.671 --> 18:48.132
No, I believe I made myself clear.
There is another I wish to speak to.

18:50.612 --> 18:57.074
I'm afraid Agent Dunham is preoccupied.
So lucky you, you get me.

19:02.090 --> 19:03.182
You don't look well.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.624
Which is why I was hoping to speak
with Agent Dunham as soon as possible.

19:08.330 --> 19:13.461
I prefer to avoid any additional,
unnecessary deaths.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.033
Now, when Agent Dunham
comes to see me...

19:19.208 --> 19:21.335
...I will require the following items.

19:21.510 --> 19:24.343
A standard walkie-talkie
with removable crystals...

19:24.513 --> 19:28.313
...metallic ballpoint pen,
and an eyeglass-repair kit.

19:28.483 --> 19:31.111
An analog wristwatch.

19:32.721 --> 19:34.052
Your watch would do.

19:36.325 --> 19:41.422
- You sure you don't need anything else?
- Quite sure. Yes.

20:18.166 --> 20:20.657
- Anything?
- Nothing criminal.

20:20.836 --> 20:23.532
All right. Let's lock it up and get back.

20:40.355 --> 20:41.583
What the hell?

20:41.757 --> 20:45.193
I need a med kit now!

20:45.994 --> 20:47.586
Quick, help me hold him.

20:48.563 --> 20:51.259
He's suffocating. I need to trach him.

21:03.845 --> 21:06.575
Oh, come on, come on. Okay, breathe.

21:08.283 --> 21:11.081
Okay. He's breathing.

21:13.422 --> 21:16.391
No, no, no!

21:19.928 --> 21:21.828
Oh, God.

21:58.467 --> 22:00.298
- Where are we?
- We've got audio.

22:00.469 --> 22:02.801
Visual coming up right now.

22:05.140 --> 22:09.099
Move in closer on this.
I wanna record every twitch.

22:13.715 --> 22:17.048
Finally, a welcome face.

22:17.219 --> 22:19.187
A colleague of mine just died.

22:19.354 --> 22:22.983
He was 27 years old.
He was due to get married next month.

22:23.158 --> 22:25.626
Yes, I tried to prevent that.

22:25.794 --> 22:28.285
Your Agent Harris
needed some convincing.

22:28.697 --> 22:31.996
- Here I am.
- Have you brought the items I requested?

22:38.140 --> 22:39.869
This will only take a moment.

22:40.042 --> 22:41.634
Move in on this, and the hands.

22:50.852 --> 22:51.978
The hell's he doing?

22:56.191 --> 22:58.352
That's a thousand-dollar watch.

23:18.213 --> 23:20.238
- What's happening in there?
- I don't know.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.111
I've managed to get us some privacy.

23:28.290 --> 23:31.691
It's just you and me now,
but we haven't much time.

23:31.860 --> 23:34.454
You were responsible
for what happened to Thomas Avery.

23:34.663 --> 23:36.631
I'm simply the stage setter.

23:36.798 --> 23:39.232
An example
that doesn't need to be followed.

23:39.401 --> 23:42.029
Well, that implies
that you're planning something else.

23:42.204 --> 23:43.899
Something far worse, yes.

23:44.072 --> 23:48.372
- What is it?
- First, I need your services.

23:48.543 --> 23:50.443
What the hell do you want?

23:52.314 --> 23:54.714
I need you to pass a test.

23:57.419 --> 24:00.547
Get Dunham out. That device
is blocking our surveillance system.

24:00.722 --> 24:02.087
He can't hurt her, Sanford.

24:02.257 --> 24:05.055
He's just trying to show you
who's in charge.

24:05.227 --> 24:07.889
When I turned myself in,
there was a key in my pocket...

24:08.063 --> 24:09.553
...as I'm sure you're aware.

24:09.731 --> 24:11.961
Take the key,
which I assume is in Forensics.

24:12.134 --> 24:15.763
Go to Salem, the amusement park
on Policy Street.

24:15.937 --> 24:18.462
I've left something there for you.

24:20.008 --> 24:22.806
- Oh!
- You need medical attention.

24:24.212 --> 24:30.515
All the assistance in this world
could not cure me, Miss Dunham.

24:31.119 --> 24:34.282
It seems that when one is
dematerialized on a molecular level...

24:34.456 --> 24:36.083
...and then reassembled...

24:36.258 --> 24:39.819
...there are certain
unadvertised side effects.

24:40.428 --> 24:42.328
But who knows?

24:44.132 --> 24:48.034
Perhaps this task I have for you could
lead to something that might help me.

24:48.236 --> 24:50.170
Tell me about the attack
you're planning.

24:50.338 --> 24:52.966
- I'd call it insurance.
- I don't care what you call it.

24:53.141 --> 24:56.508
As we speak, a white cargo van
is transporting an explosive device...

24:56.678 --> 24:59.146
...capable of killing hundreds
in the manner of...

24:59.314 --> 25:01.874
...the newspaper salesman
and your deceased colleague.

25:02.050 --> 25:04.348
- Is it set to go off?
- Sixteen hours from now.

25:04.519 --> 25:06.714
Before anything,
you are going to disable...

25:06.888 --> 25:10.449
No, you are.
But first there's the matter of the key.

25:12.761 --> 25:16.288
- Enough. I want you out of this room.
- Don't worry, Miss Dunham.

25:16.464 --> 25:19.490
If I wanted to harm you, I would have.

25:19.668 --> 25:22.136
Long ago.

25:26.374 --> 25:29.138
Apologies about the watch.

25:31.346 --> 25:35.248
Jones is planting a device somewhere,
capable of killing in the same way...

25:35.417 --> 25:38.511
...that guy from the newsstand died.
He won't say where or when.

25:38.687 --> 25:42.316
We need every white van rented
within the last 48 hours tracked down.

25:42.490 --> 25:44.424
In the meantime,
I need two hours alone.

25:44.593 --> 25:48.188
- Why? Where you going?
- To get a massage.

25:50.398 --> 25:51.865
I'll tell you when I get back.

26:03.078 --> 26:05.239
Hey, it's me. Where are we at?

26:05.447 --> 26:07.381
We know how folks
are ending up faceless.

26:07.549 --> 26:10.177
It's a powdered toxin
that's absorbed through the skin.

26:10.352 --> 26:14.345
It triggers a hyperactivity
in the protein responsible for scar tissue.

26:14.523 --> 26:16.991
- You want any more detail than that?
- Not really.

26:17.159 --> 26:19.150
Did you hear
that Jones turned himself in?

26:19.328 --> 26:21.819
- I did. You get anything?
- Yeah, that he's crazy.

26:21.997 --> 26:24.557
And he's planning on using
that toxin again, and soon.

26:24.733 --> 26:26.530
How's Walter coming
with the antidote?

26:26.702 --> 26:28.670
He's working on it. He says,
and I quote:

26:28.837 --> 26:31.772
"It'll be ready when it's ready,
and not a moment before."

26:31.974 --> 26:36.070
Great. Anything in the manuscript that
might suggest what Jones' endgame is?

26:36.245 --> 26:39.510
It reads like a happy combo
between an anti-science manifesto...

26:39.681 --> 26:41.012
...and a call to arms.

26:41.183 --> 26:43.947
- Call to arms against whom?
- Exactly.

26:44.119 --> 26:46.110
I'll call you
when I get to the good part.

26:46.288 --> 26:49.917
Yeah. Maybe it'll help us figure out
where this next attack is gonna be.

26:50.092 --> 26:52.356
I'll be back
as soon as I get the package.

26:52.528 --> 26:53.620
Okay.

26:53.796 --> 26:54.922
- Was that Olivia?
- Yeah.

26:57.266 --> 26:58.392
Where's the manuscript?

26:58.567 --> 27:01.365
- Is she bringing coffee cake?
- No, she's not getting food.

27:01.537 --> 27:03.767
Have you seen the manuscript
I was reading?

27:06.008 --> 27:08.306
It's fascinating, isn't it?

27:08.510 --> 27:11.240
I was just reading it
whilst sitting on the crapper.

27:11.413 --> 27:13.711
Please, no more information.
Can I have it back?

27:13.882 --> 27:15.372
I must read you one excerpt.

27:15.918 --> 27:18.648
Great. Well, grab the blankie.
It's nap time.

27:19.254 --> 27:23.782
"We think we understand reality.
But our universe is only one of many.

27:23.959 --> 27:27.417
The unknown truth is that the way
to travel between them...

27:27.596 --> 27:31.828
...has already been discovered
by beings much like us...

27:32.034 --> 27:34.400
...but whose history
is slightly ahead of our own.

27:34.570 --> 27:37.801
The negative aspects of such visitations
will be irreversible...

27:37.973 --> 27:40.840
...both to our world and to theirs.

27:41.043 --> 27:44.308
It will begin with a series
of unnatural occurrences...

27:44.479 --> 27:49.178
...difficult to notice at first,
but growing, not unlike a cancer...

27:49.351 --> 27:52.582
...until a simple fact
becomes undeniable:

27:52.754 --> 27:56.121
Only one world will survive...

27:57.192 --> 28:01.094
...and it will either be us or them."

28:05.133 --> 28:07.499
"Miss Dunham,
I know how this appears:

28:07.669 --> 28:11.161
That I've sent you quite a distance
to pick up a box of children's games.

28:11.340 --> 28:13.865
But what I've hidden here
is not a game at all.

28:14.076 --> 28:17.603
You are holding an evaluation system,
a series of tests...

28:17.779 --> 28:20.373
...designed to cultivate specific,
innate skills...

28:20.582 --> 28:23.107
...present in particular individuals.

28:23.518 --> 28:27.215
Do the first test only. Complete it
successfully and come back to see me.

28:27.389 --> 28:29.050
Do this, and no one else will die."

28:29.224 --> 28:31.055
I got the instructions.

28:31.226 --> 28:34.684
So Jones is threatening to kill
hundreds of people unless I take a test.

28:34.863 --> 28:37.661
- Unless you pass a test.
- What does my passing a test...

28:37.833 --> 28:41.667
...have to do with Jones killing people?
- Insanity.

28:41.837 --> 28:44.965
You can't pose rational questions
when you're dealing with Jones.

28:45.140 --> 28:50.043
Indeed. And whatever Mr. Jones'
true goal may be...

28:51.179 --> 28:54.842
...we only have eight hours left
until his next attack.

28:57.352 --> 29:01.914
"Test one." Of 10, by the way.
"Turn switch on.

29:02.124 --> 29:04.888
The recruit sits no more than 24 inches
from the device...

29:05.060 --> 29:08.518
...but cannot touch the light board.
The recruit focuses on light board.

29:08.697 --> 29:11.427
The object of the test is
to shut down the lights...

29:11.633 --> 29:13.760
...so that, ultimately,
none are illuminated."

29:13.936 --> 29:16.700
- How?
- Using all your magic powers, I guess.

29:16.872 --> 29:21.036
Curious. The instructions refer
to the recruit.

29:21.209 --> 29:24.337
The author of the manuscript
uses the same term.

29:24.513 --> 29:28.609
"Many warriors of the inevitable
confrontation are among us now...

29:28.784 --> 29:31.776
...but before
they can be considered soldiers...

29:31.954 --> 29:34.787
...they must be regarded as recruits...

29:35.390 --> 29:39.451
...and the expectation must be
that they shall be unwilling."

29:41.229 --> 29:44.596
So I'm supposed to just turn
these lights off by looking at them?

29:44.766 --> 29:47.894
It wouldn't be much of a test
if we could take out the battery.

29:51.573 --> 29:52.938
Fine.

30:36.918 --> 30:38.283
- Dunham.
- We just got a hit.

30:38.453 --> 30:41.786
Steady Car Rentals in New Haven
leased a white van yesterday morning...

30:41.957 --> 30:43.447
And you're gonna love this.

30:43.625 --> 30:45.183
To one Olivia Dunham.

30:45.360 --> 30:47.521
- No.
- Oh, yeah, he's messing with you, Liv.

30:47.729 --> 30:50.163
Got police scouring the area.
So far, no luck.

30:50.332 --> 30:51.993
Thanks, Charlie.

30:52.801 --> 30:54.962
This is just a stupid mind game.

30:55.670 --> 30:58.503
- Where are you going?
- To end it.

30:58.673 --> 31:00.334
I will not let him use that device.

31:00.509 --> 31:03.307
If you're gonna meet with Jones,
I want full surveillance.

31:03.478 --> 31:06.777
Sir, the last time you got your way,
we lost a good agent.

31:06.948 --> 31:09.178
Do you really
wanna get in the way again?

31:09.351 --> 31:12.650
We have less than seven hours before
something horrific will happen.

31:12.821 --> 31:14.220
Something I'm trying to stop.

31:14.389 --> 31:16.550
And for some reason,
Jones is out to get me.

31:16.758 --> 31:20.956
So, sir,
would you please let me handle this?

31:35.544 --> 31:37.739
- I got your test kit.
- You didn't bring it?

31:37.913 --> 31:40.245
- I didn't need to...
- Your reluctance is expected.

31:40.415 --> 31:44.181
- I know what you're doing, Mr. Jones.
- I'm trying to get you to pass test one.

31:44.352 --> 31:47.344
I know about the manuscript.
The manifesto. ZFT.

31:47.522 --> 31:49.854
I know you believe that
there's some war coming...

31:50.025 --> 31:52.186
- You've read it?
- You're recruiting warriors.

31:52.360 --> 31:54.760
That's the word you used, isn't it?

31:54.930 --> 31:56.693
You don't believe you're worthy?

31:56.865 --> 32:00.198
I believe everybody, even you,
is entitled to their belief system...

32:00.368 --> 32:02.359
...but somehow,
you got me into your head.

32:02.537 --> 32:04.300
Somehow?

32:04.806 --> 32:06.364
Yes.

32:07.342 --> 32:11.802
You were among those treated
with Cortexiphan.

32:12.114 --> 32:14.605
It's why we had you taken.
We needed confirmation...

32:15.317 --> 32:18.445
...something which requires
a spinal tap.

32:19.955 --> 32:25.222
The next step, had you not escaped,
was to convince you of this.

32:26.027 --> 32:28.257
I have never been treated
with Cortexiphan.

32:28.430 --> 32:30.728
- I haven't even heard of it.
- You wouldn't have.

32:30.899 --> 32:32.423
I don't believe you, Mr. Jones.

32:32.601 --> 32:36.367
I believe you've created some ridiculous
scenario where people's lives rely...

32:36.538 --> 32:39.803
...on me attempting
and failing an impossible task.

32:39.975 --> 32:42.910
- The task is hardly impossible.
- I will not let people die...

32:43.078 --> 32:44.568
...because of some stupid game.

32:44.746 --> 32:48.375
- This is no game.
- You need to cooperate, Mr. Jones.

32:48.550 --> 32:52.782
No, Miss Dunham,
it is you who needs to cooperate.

32:54.990 --> 32:56.150
Mr. Jones?

32:56.358 --> 32:58.053
Pulse slowing to 50 beats per minute.

32:58.226 --> 33:02.219
- Get him up there. Astrid, set up the EKG.
- Is this the patient?

33:02.397 --> 33:04.831
Walter, put the cow away,
would you?

33:05.000 --> 33:08.766
- What is this place?
- It's a freak show.

33:08.937 --> 33:11.735
Thanks for your help. Thank you.

33:22.751 --> 33:25.652
- It is happening quicker than I imagined.
- What's happening?

33:25.820 --> 33:29.688
You understand this man
teleported through space?

33:29.858 --> 33:32.850
His molecules disintegrating
and reintegrating.

33:33.028 --> 33:35.087
I mean, the very implications of it...

33:35.263 --> 33:37.424
We need a video camera.
We should record this.

33:37.632 --> 33:41.068
This man is our chance to stop
a device that could kill a lot of people.

33:41.236 --> 33:43.204
- I need you to stabilize him.
- Of course.

33:43.371 --> 33:47.205
- Okay.
- Point taken. I'll do a thorough exam.

33:47.375 --> 33:50.867
Meanwhile, get me 50 cc's
of saline, please.

33:51.046 --> 33:53.537
- Hey, Astrid, do you mind?
- Sure.

33:56.451 --> 34:00.012
No, of course they did.
Why am I not surprised?

34:00.188 --> 34:02.679
- Thanks, Charlie.
- Anything?

34:02.857 --> 34:06.122
Yeah. That drug Jones claims
is in my body, Cortexiphan?

34:06.294 --> 34:09.388
It's a drug patented, but not approved,
by the FDA.

34:09.563 --> 34:12.465
- Patented to whom?
- To Massive Dynamic.

34:14.202 --> 34:17.694
- Why am I not surprised?
- That's what I just said. Jones?

34:17.871 --> 34:19.464
Walter's replenishing his fluids.

34:19.674 --> 34:23.405
He's gonna have to give him a full exam
before we know if he can wake him up.

34:23.578 --> 34:25.978
I'm gonna find out what I can
about Cortexiphan...

34:26.181 --> 34:29.581
...but in the meantime, he's actually
expecting me to be able to do it.

34:29.751 --> 34:32.481
- To do what?
- Test number one. The flashing lights.

34:32.687 --> 34:35.212
Jones won't cooperate
unless I pass the test.

34:37.926 --> 34:39.621
You think we can trick him?

34:39.793 --> 34:43.321
What are you asking me to do?
You want me to open up the light box?

34:43.498 --> 34:45.056
You could see what you could do.

34:48.803 --> 34:51.168
Thank you for seeing me
at such short notice.

34:51.339 --> 34:55.672
As I said, I am always available
to you, Olivia.

34:55.844 --> 34:56.936
What can I do?

34:57.112 --> 35:00.775
I need information on a drug
called Cortexiphan.

35:00.949 --> 35:02.610
Doesn't ring a bell. Let me check.

35:11.259 --> 35:12.521
Is everything all right?

35:13.595 --> 35:16.155
My hand. It's been acting up.

35:16.331 --> 35:18.856
I need to have it looked at. Ha.

35:24.806 --> 35:27.366
Oh, yes. I recall this. Cortexiphan.

35:27.542 --> 35:31.808
It was part of a clinical trial of a drug
that Dr. Bell created in '81.

35:31.980 --> 35:33.811
What is it, if you don't mind?

35:33.982 --> 35:38.316
Dr. Bell theorized that the human mind
at birth is infinitely capable...

35:38.486 --> 35:42.684
...and that every force it encounters...
social, physical, intellectual.

35:42.857 --> 35:45.951
Is the beginning of a process
he referred to as limitation...

35:46.127 --> 35:48.118
...a diminishing of that potential.

35:48.797 --> 35:50.162
And Cortexiphan?

35:50.332 --> 35:53.665
It was meant to limit that limitation...

35:53.835 --> 35:57.862
...to prevent the natural shrinking
of that brain power.

35:58.039 --> 36:00.371
- To prevent, not undo.
- Meaning?

36:00.542 --> 36:03.375
- The drug was administered to children.
- Yes.

36:03.545 --> 36:06.036
The drugs
were extensively animal-tested.

36:06.214 --> 36:09.547
They were harmless
to the children who received them.

36:09.718 --> 36:11.913
Unfortunately,
they were also unsuccessful...

36:12.087 --> 36:15.853
...so Dr. Bell abandoned his research
on Cortexiphan in 1983.

36:16.024 --> 36:19.357
- And where were the trials?
- Dr. Bell conducted the trials himself...

36:19.527 --> 36:22.155
...at Ohio State University,
Wooster Campus.

36:22.330 --> 36:25.857
- Nowhere else?
- No.

36:26.735 --> 36:30.227
Why, if you don't mind me asking?

36:30.705 --> 36:34.232
Nothing. It's good to know.

36:35.610 --> 36:38.238
No matter what Jones believes,
I was never given the drug.

36:38.413 --> 36:40.904
William Bell conducted his trials
in Ohio.

36:41.082 --> 36:44.677
In 1981, I was 3,
living in Jacksonville, Florida.

36:44.853 --> 36:47.014
My dad was stationed
at the Naval base there.

36:47.188 --> 36:49.679
That's great. In other news...

36:49.858 --> 36:52.918
...Walter thinks he's gonna be able
to revive Jones soon...

36:53.094 --> 36:55.927
...and I was able
to reprogram the light box.

36:56.097 --> 36:59.760
- We should be able to fake Jones out.
- I knew you could do it. See you soon.

37:14.649 --> 37:18.210
If there's cardiac arrest,
we'll need nitroglycerin. Peter, prepare.

37:20.889 --> 37:24.484
Mr. Jones, we have two hours
before your planned attack hits...

37:24.659 --> 37:27.059
...and I think I've passed
test number one.

37:31.099 --> 37:32.794
Dr. Bishop...

37:33.768 --> 37:37.431
...without your extraordinary work...

37:37.605 --> 37:41.302
...I wouldn't have ever had the pleasure
of making your acquaintance.

37:42.577 --> 37:48.140
I locked the teleporter away for a reason,
one of which you are now experiencing.

37:48.316 --> 37:52.480
Nevertheless, it is an honor.

37:52.654 --> 37:55.817
Jones, I pass the test,
you tell us everything we need...

37:55.990 --> 37:59.824
...to stop whatever you're planning.
- That was always the deal.

39:06.961 --> 39:09.828
Well done, Miss Dunham.

39:11.666 --> 39:13.463
Thank you.

39:15.570 --> 39:18.004
- Your turn.
- Indeed.

39:18.172 --> 39:22.700
923 Church Street, 47th floor.

39:22.877 --> 39:24.037
You better hurry.

39:25.880 --> 39:29.714
This is Agent Dunham. I need
immediate evac, 923 Church Street.

39:29.884 --> 39:31.749
There's a device on the 47th floor.

39:31.920 --> 39:32.944
Nicely done.

39:33.121 --> 39:35.055
Good performance.

39:37.292 --> 39:39.556
I need these streets cleared now!

39:39.727 --> 39:45.256
Anyone within a four-block radius
has to move! Go! Double time!

39:46.701 --> 39:48.566
Hey. Where are we?

39:48.736 --> 39:51.899
Building's about 70 percent clear.
We lucked out.

39:52.073 --> 39:55.270
They're undergoing renovations,
so not all the floors are occupied.

39:55.443 --> 39:57.707
- So the device?
- This one's a real mess.

39:57.879 --> 39:59.346
Bomb squad says they can't move it...

39:59.514 --> 40:00.981
...or defuse it.
- Why?

40:01.149 --> 40:03.617
They've never seen wiring like this.

40:11.426 --> 40:13.223
Oh, my God.

40:29.777 --> 40:32.439
To blow out the windows.

40:32.780 --> 40:35.647
- Four blocks ain't gonna cut it.
- Not even close.

40:35.883 --> 40:37.578
I'm on it.

40:37.752 --> 40:40.983
Contact the weather service.
We need to map the fallout pattern.

40:41.155 --> 40:42.782
And get FEMA up to speed.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.384
Agent Farnsworth.

40:46.928 --> 40:49.590
It's me. That son of a bitch
knew what we were doing.

40:49.764 --> 40:52.096
- What?
- He knew that we were faking him out.

40:52.266 --> 40:53.290
Is he still conscious?

40:55.870 --> 40:58.600
- Barely.
- Put him on.

41:00.975 --> 41:03.000
It's Olivia.

41:07.582 --> 41:10.813
- Hello, you.
- I can't do this.

41:11.119 --> 41:13.144
I remain confident that you can.

41:13.321 --> 41:15.789
Look, you know what I did before,
it wasn't real.

41:15.957 --> 41:19.518
Yes. I know, Miss Dunham.

41:19.694 --> 41:23.528
Before they can be considered soldiers,
they must be regarded as recruits...

41:23.698 --> 41:27.691
...and the expectation must be
that they shall be unwilling.

41:27.902 --> 41:30.598
Mr. Jones, I am willing.
I am willing, but I am not able.

41:30.772 --> 41:32.831
- We gotta go.
- There's one way to disable...

41:33.007 --> 41:36.306
...that device,
and you know what that is.

41:37.311 --> 41:42.214
Okay. You think that I'm valuable.
Valuable enough to kidnap, to train.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.612
You are a rare commodity, true.

41:44.786 --> 41:48.119
Okay, if you don't deactivate
this device, I'm gonna die...

41:48.289 --> 41:51.053
...which means
that your rare commodity is gone.

41:51.225 --> 41:55.184
But I have one thing, Miss Dunham,
that you do not.

41:56.164 --> 41:58.689
I have faith in you.

42:00.134 --> 42:04.366
There is no red wire, no blue.
Only black.

42:04.539 --> 42:07.474
Cut any one of them
and the device blows.

42:07.642 --> 42:10.042
Try and remove it
and the device blows.

42:10.211 --> 42:13.977
And if those lights are still on
when the timer hits zero...

42:14.148 --> 42:16.139
...the device blows.

42:16.317 --> 42:20.651
There is only one way out,
and it's you.

42:24.859 --> 42:27.760
Okay, we need to get these people
out of here.

42:29.163 --> 42:31.597
Whoa, whoa, where are you going?

42:31.766 --> 42:35.600
Olivia, we gotta go.
What did Jones say?

42:36.104 --> 42:38.504
- Olivia.
- I need to do this. There's no other way.

42:38.673 --> 42:41.699
If you stay here, you are going to die.

42:42.410 --> 42:45.106
I'm not doing this with you, Olivia.

42:47.415 --> 42:49.679
You're out of your mind.

44:16.270 --> 44:17.999
You did it.

44:19.273 --> 44:21.833
What was that?
How did you do that?

44:24.312 --> 44:26.041
I don't know.

44:26.214 --> 44:28.079
I don't know.

44:33.020 --> 44:34.817
Farnsworth.

44:36.724 --> 44:38.453
Yes, sir.

44:40.194 --> 44:42.685
Thank you. We will.

44:43.197 --> 44:46.291
Wait. Wait.

44:48.903 --> 44:51.701
- She did it, didn't she?
- It seems she did.

44:52.740 --> 44:54.207
My girl.

44:57.879 --> 44:59.540
You okay?

45:03.150 --> 45:05.345
I didn't do anything...

45:06.153 --> 45:07.643
...with those lights.

45:07.822 --> 45:10.757
He planned it. Jones.
It was all just a mind game.

45:11.859 --> 45:13.520
How do you plan it? Plan what?

45:13.694 --> 45:15.992
They were programmed to turn off.

45:16.163 --> 45:19.564
Maybe, but he couldn't have known
when you were gonna arrive.

45:19.734 --> 45:22.726
- He couldn't have known the timing.
- Well, that's what he did.

45:22.904 --> 45:26.704
I'm the last to subscribe to this stuff,
but you were in the zone out there.

45:26.874 --> 45:30.002
The way you stared down that box
was like nothing I've ever seen.

45:30.177 --> 45:32.702
- It wasn't me.
- Fine. Let me play devil's advocate.

45:32.880 --> 45:35.007
Why did Jones choose you at all?

45:36.183 --> 45:38.947
Because of your father.
He wanted to meet your father.

45:39.153 --> 45:43.249
The man who designed the device
that let him escape from prison.

45:43.424 --> 45:46.291
And you think
that's what all this was about?

45:47.061 --> 45:50.622
Okay. Fine. Look, all I know is
I didn't die tonight...

45:50.798 --> 45:54.427
...so I'm pretty much willing to accept
any explanation you wanna give.

45:54.602 --> 45:58.060
You wanna go get a drink or five?
I've seen you with a whiskey bottle.

46:00.107 --> 46:02.803
Jones was just transferred
to Boston General, so...

46:02.977 --> 46:05.377
I have a few questions for him.

46:06.213 --> 46:09.080
- It's my last chance.
- Yeah.

46:15.723 --> 46:19.386
So in all the excitement of today,
I forgot to say something.

46:19.560 --> 46:24.896
I haven't overlooked the fact that you
actually created a teleportation machine.

46:26.267 --> 46:29.794
Well, I suppose I did.

46:29.971 --> 46:32.667
Which, despite the fact
that using it kills you...

46:32.840 --> 46:37.277
...is pretty damn cool.

46:37.445 --> 46:39.470
Kills you?

46:41.215 --> 46:44.207
It does something unthinkable...

46:45.152 --> 46:47.143
...but it doesn't kill you.

46:50.958 --> 46:52.186
All personnel...

46:52.360 --> 46:55.158
...follow emergency guidelines.
Repeat, all personnel...

46:55.329 --> 46:58.423
...follow emergency guidelines.
- We need the evidence.

47:00.301 --> 47:04.761
- Nearest emergency exit. All personnel,
follow emergency guidelines.

48:10.071 --> 48:13.563
- Hello?
- Agent Dunham? Nina Sharp.

48:13.741 --> 48:15.675
Hand's back to normal.

48:16.944 --> 48:18.411
Good for you.

48:19.847 --> 48:22.042
I was curious about
that question you asked...

48:22.216 --> 48:26.414
...whether there were other places
where Cortexiphan was tested.

48:26.587 --> 48:29.420
- Yes?
- There was, it turns out...

48:29.590 --> 48:31.455
...a second clinical trial...

48:31.625 --> 48:33.718
...though much smaller
than the one in Ohio.

48:35.196 --> 48:39.189
- There was?
- Yes, in Jacksonville, Florida...

48:39.366 --> 48:41.766
...at a military base.

48:43.137 --> 48:44.604
Agent Dunham?

48:44.772 --> 48:46.535
Thank you very much for calling.

48:46.707 --> 48:50.575
You're most welcome.
Have a good night.
