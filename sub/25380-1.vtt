14:52.500 --> 14:54.284
"In the event
that she does not survive me,

14:54.328 --> 14:57.331
"then I give, devise,
and bequeath my entire estate

14:57.374 --> 15:00.029
"to be divided equally
among my two children,

15:00.073 --> 15:04.033
Verity Jane
and Jonathan Alexander."

15:04.077 --> 15:05.861
I'm, I'm sorry.

15:05.905 --> 15:08.124
Um, when our mother passed,

15:08.168 --> 15:09.734
our father became
the executor of her will.

15:09.778 --> 15:11.214
Who becomes the executor now?

15:11.258 --> 15:13.347
I do.
Well, obviously,

15:13.390 --> 15:14.652
you'll both continue
to receive the allowance

15:14.696 --> 15:17.612
that you've been
getting up till now.

15:17.655 --> 15:20.397
You will each come into
your half share of the trust

15:20.441 --> 15:22.530
as stipulated by your mother.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.488
And how much was that?

15:26.273 --> 15:29.885
About 10 million dollars.

15:29.929 --> 15:33.323
I would venture that that's why
Richard felt no compunction

15:33.367 --> 15:36.065
in giving everything
that he had to Louise.

15:36.109 --> 15:39.155
He knew you both were
very well taken care of.

15:39.199 --> 15:40.635
And I want you both to know

15:40.678 --> 15:43.986
that you are
always welcome here.

15:44.030 --> 15:47.337
This house is just as
much yours as it is mine.

15:47.381 --> 15:49.513
We're family now.

15:49.557 --> 15:52.603
That is very generous of you,

15:52.647 --> 15:56.172
but you do realize the house...
It's not part of the estate.

15:56.216 --> 15:59.436
Uh, what?

15:59.480 --> 16:00.742
You can look through the papers.

16:00.785 --> 16:02.265
You won't find
any property title there

16:02.309 --> 16:04.050
because it doesn't exist.

16:04.093 --> 16:07.705
Yeah. The house...
Was our mother's house.

16:07.749 --> 16:09.533
What?

16:09.577 --> 16:13.015
The house has been in
our name since she passed.

16:13.059 --> 16:14.930
Obviously, we let
our Dad live here.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.237
- You didn't know that?
- No, I didn't know that.

16:17.280 --> 16:21.197
I just assumed I'm his widow
and the house would be...

16:23.547 --> 16:27.769
I'm sorry.
I didn't know.

16:27.812 --> 16:31.251
I just didn't realize
I'd lose a husband and a home.

16:31.294 --> 16:33.340
You assumed wrong, Louise.

16:33.383 --> 16:37.474
This is our mother's house.
This will never be your house.

16:37.518 --> 16:40.086
I would appreciate it
if you would leave.

16:40.129 --> 16:42.479
I want you gone tomorrow,
both of you.

16:42.523 --> 16:45.221
- I want you both gone.
- God, Jonathan, would you...

16:45.265 --> 16:47.441
I need to get some air.

16:47.484 --> 16:48.659
Oh, God!

16:51.488 --> 16:53.229
Where do you get off
talking to her like that?

16:56.102 --> 16:57.712
Excuse her.

16:57.755 --> 16:59.148
She does this sometimes.

17:04.414 --> 17:07.069
It would be good
if the two of you young,

17:07.113 --> 17:10.637
fine folks would try and put
yourself in her situation.

17:10.681 --> 17:14.337
This has been
very tough on her...

17:14.381 --> 17:19.038

but, well, you were estranged,

17:19.080 --> 17:23.085

longtime friend,

17:23.128 --> 17:26.915

her soulmate, didn't she?

17:29.570 --> 17:31.615

17:31.659 --> 17:33.356
Gladly.

18:05.040 --> 18:06.215
How could you miss the house?

18:06.259 --> 18:08.130

his own business.

18:08.174 --> 18:11.133
Outside the will and the trust,

18:11.177 --> 18:14.223

I could have known.

18:21.100 --> 18:25.626

you get everything he owned.

18:25.669 --> 18:28.629

bank accounts, the bonds.

18:28.672 --> 18:31.936

Well, this'll be good for
them, especially Jonathan.

45:12.318 --> 45:14.842
He really needs to
blow off some steam.

45:14.886 --> 45:17.497
This has all been
pretty hard on him.

45:17.540 --> 45:19.281
He's not usually like this.

45:19.325 --> 45:21.240
He's not?

45:21.283 --> 45:23.111
Because he's always told me
how to do life.

45:27.246 --> 45:28.769
How'd you two meet?

45:28.813 --> 45:31.554
- How did we meet?
- Mm-hmm.

45:31.598 --> 45:34.732
We were working on the same
case together. Pro bono.

45:34.775 --> 45:39.214
No money in it,
but good karma, you know.

45:39.258 --> 45:41.303
He was so passionate.

45:42.522 --> 45:44.132
A real fighter for justice.

45:45.394 --> 45:46.787
Really?

45:46.831 --> 45:48.833
Yeah. Have you
not seen him in court?

45:48.876 --> 45:52.924
No. I actually
can't say that I have.

45:52.967 --> 45:56.057
You should.
You'd be proud.

45:58.277 --> 45:59.974
Wow!

46:00.018 --> 46:01.367
All right.
You just keep the bow pointed

46:01.410 --> 46:02.760
in the general direction
you want to go,

46:02.803 --> 46:04.674
you pick a spot on the horizon.

46:04.718 --> 46:06.676
Don't over correct too much,
and then you're sailing.

46:06.720 --> 46:09.897
Look at that.
Lifelong dream accomplished.

46:09.941 --> 46:11.812
Aye-aye, captain.

46:15.642 --> 46:18.471
Listen, what's up
with you and my sister?

46:18.514 --> 46:20.734
What do you mean?

46:20.778 --> 46:23.606
I mean, she's your stepsister.

46:23.650 --> 46:26.218
That's kind of weird.

46:26.261 --> 46:27.915
Well, I mean, no, it's not.

46:27.959 --> 46:29.830
Not really because
there's no genetics there.

46:29.874 --> 46:31.397
I know.
I get that. I get that.

46:33.791 --> 46:34.835
Is this about my mother?

46:37.142 --> 46:38.186
It is, isn't it?

46:40.275 --> 46:42.756
You want to know a secret?

46:42.800 --> 46:44.758
I hate her, too.

46:44.802 --> 46:47.239
Oh, yeah.
But think about it.

46:47.282 --> 46:49.284
You've gotten to hang out
for what, about a week?

46:49.328 --> 46:51.199
Me? I've got my whole
entire life, bud.

46:51.243 --> 46:52.722
Okay? Every single day.

46:52.766 --> 46:54.507
"Why didn't you
button your shirt?

46:54.550 --> 46:57.118
You should meet a nice girl."
Every single time.

46:57.162 --> 46:59.207
I mean, come on.

46:59.251 --> 47:02.254
I hate her just as much as you.

47:02.297 --> 47:03.255
So, we've got that in common.

47:03.298 --> 47:05.474
Hey look, take the wheel.

47:05.518 --> 47:07.302
- Take the wheel.
- Really?

47:07.346 --> 47:08.521
Really?

47:10.218 --> 47:11.916
There you go.

47:11.959 --> 47:14.309
Now you're a sailor.
Now you're a sailor.

47:14.353 --> 47:15.789
All right, keep her steady.

47:15.833 --> 47:17.530
- Okay.
- Towards the water tower.

47:17.573 --> 47:19.227
All right.

47:19.271 --> 47:22.100
Yeah! Wow!

47:22.143 --> 47:24.015
- Keep her steady.
- Wow!

47:24.058 --> 47:25.451
Don't bring her around until
we're ready to tack, alright?

47:25.494 --> 47:27.975
Okay.
Do you need my help?

47:28.019 --> 47:30.238
Hey, man the helm!

47:30.282 --> 47:31.674
Oh, I'm sorry.

47:34.460 --> 47:35.983
You know, it's amazing.

47:36.027 --> 47:38.768
Thousands of years
the Phoenicians,

47:38.812 --> 47:41.641
then the Greeks, the British.

47:41.684 --> 47:43.730
You know, just repeating
the same thing, buddy.

47:43.773 --> 47:45.950
You're making it real hard
to dislike you, Eric.

47:45.993 --> 47:47.299
You too.

47:51.477 --> 47:53.131
- Hey, Jonathan...
- Huh?

47:53.174 --> 47:54.480
Heads up!

47:59.224 --> 48:04.664
Jon! Jon! Jon? Jon!

48:04.707 --> 48:06.927
Jon! Jon!

48:06.971 --> 48:10.365
Hey, hey!
Help, help!

48:10.409 --> 48:11.540
Hmmm.

48:11.584 --> 48:14.065
Hey! Help!

48:14.108 --> 48:15.805
Hey, what are they doing?

48:15.849 --> 48:19.026
I don't know.
They're rowdy.

48:19.070 --> 48:22.769
Oh, God!
Help! Help!

48:22.812 --> 48:25.119
Wait a minute.
Is that...

48:25.163 --> 48:27.252
Is that Jonathan?

48:27.295 --> 48:28.949
What? Oh, my God!

48:28.993 --> 48:31.560
- Jonathan!
- Jonathan!

48:31.604 --> 48:33.432
Jonathan!

48:33.475 --> 48:34.563
Jonathan!

48:34.607 --> 48:36.435
Jonathan!

48:36.478 --> 48:38.393
Call...
Call 9-1-1!

48:38.437 --> 48:40.439
Jonathan!

48:51.406 --> 48:53.278
And you can't swim?

48:53.321 --> 48:57.151
No. No.
I... I never learned how.

48:57.195 --> 48:58.892
I mean, this is my first
time even on a boat.

48:58.936 --> 49:00.981
Oh, all right.

49:01.025 --> 49:02.591
I'm going to get your name
and phone number.

49:02.635 --> 49:04.854
If you think of anything
else, please notify us.

49:17.041 --> 49:19.695
Verity.
Oh, I'm so sorry, honey.

49:21.132 --> 49:24.004
Oh, I loved Jonathan so much

49:24.048 --> 49:26.354
regardless of the way
he treated me.

49:26.398 --> 49:28.052
He's such a special young man.

49:28.095 --> 49:30.184
Please just go away.

49:30.228 --> 49:32.447
- Come here, baby.
- Oh, God!

49:34.710 --> 49:36.277
If there's anything
that I can do.

49:59.909 --> 50:01.128
He's dead.

50:01.172 --> 50:04.001
♪ ♪

51:10.458 --> 51:12.243
Do you want some chardonnay?

51:19.163 --> 51:20.642
No, I'm sorry, Jeanette.

51:20.686 --> 51:23.080
I am with
a very difficult client.

51:25.256 --> 51:28.128
I'll try to finish
up and be home soon.

51:28.172 --> 51:29.608
Promise.

51:29.651 --> 51:32.089
No, no, no don't.

51:32.132 --> 51:33.568
No need to wait up.

51:37.833 --> 51:40.009
So, I'm a demanding client now?

51:40.053 --> 51:42.011
Of course not.
I had to tell her something.

51:44.231 --> 51:47.278
What a terrible, terrible thing.

51:47.321 --> 51:48.888
Well, you have to admit,

51:48.931 --> 51:50.803
with Jonathan
out of the picture,

51:50.846 --> 51:52.979
things are running
more smoothly now.

51:53.022 --> 51:54.589
There's still Verity.

51:54.633 --> 51:56.113
Oh, she's the least
of our concerns.

51:56.156 --> 51:57.723
She's a drunk.

51:57.766 --> 51:59.377
She'll be penniless
and we'll be gone

51:59.420 --> 52:01.030
before she's sober enough
to realize it.

52:02.467 --> 52:05.992
But, Gary Sims...

52:06.035 --> 52:07.820
What about him?

52:07.863 --> 52:10.257
He's disgusting.

52:10.301 --> 52:13.869
He's been following me
around like a mad dog.

52:13.913 --> 52:16.959
You mean, this guy
is out here right now?

52:22.182 --> 52:23.618
But I had an idea, Eugene.

52:25.446 --> 52:26.621
You did?

52:28.362 --> 52:30.059
Yeah.

52:30.103 --> 52:34.412
Private investigator scum
like him,

52:34.455 --> 52:36.675
they tend to have
a lot of enemies.

53:03.832 --> 53:04.964
Hey.

53:06.748 --> 53:07.880
Hey.

53:10.230 --> 53:12.493
Funeral is Saturday.

53:25.506 --> 53:26.899
How are things with you?

53:29.380 --> 53:32.121
I don't even care anymore.

53:36.517 --> 53:39.781
You know, like, I know that
it is not Eric's fault but...

53:39.825 --> 53:41.783
It's not your fault either.

53:41.827 --> 53:42.828
Obviously.

53:49.313 --> 53:50.749
It's been hitting me.

53:55.101 --> 53:56.929
He's just...

53:59.714 --> 54:01.281
Gone.

54:01.325 --> 54:03.240
He's not coming back.

54:07.200 --> 54:09.507
Yeah.

54:09.550 --> 54:12.988
I feel like I kinda
gotta watch my step

54:13.032 --> 54:15.687
'cause it's like death
runs in this family.

54:23.260 --> 54:26.567
Did John tell you about the
guy, what he found out?

54:28.917 --> 54:30.658
What guy? What?

54:30.702 --> 54:33.357
The investigator guy called him,

54:33.400 --> 54:37.012
and he got all upset
and wanted to talk to you.

54:37.056 --> 54:38.579
So let's call him.

54:53.333 --> 54:55.248
You guys want to go out,

54:55.292 --> 54:57.119
get a bite to eat or something?

54:57.163 --> 54:58.686
Maybe a drink?

54:58.730 --> 55:04.083
You know what, I... I'm okay.

55:04.126 --> 55:05.911
I'm okay tonight.

55:05.954 --> 55:08.043
Raincheck?

55:08.087 --> 55:10.219
Sure.

55:10.263 --> 55:11.482
Okay.

55:26.018 --> 55:27.846
In politics today,

55:27.889 --> 55:29.804
the election is probably
going to be a close race.

55:29.848 --> 55:31.153
Now, I don't mean
to sound cynical,

55:31.197 --> 55:32.981
but I wonder if all
these promises...

55:34.940 --> 55:36.637
And in business,

55:36.681 --> 55:38.465
the stock market fell
through the floor today.

55:38.509 --> 55:40.380
No one seems to know
where it's heading.

55:40.424 --> 55:42.556
Chances are we're in
for another ride tomorrow,

55:42.600 --> 55:44.993
and in entertainment today...

55:45.037 --> 55:48.475
What? No!

55:48.519 --> 55:51.435
Six kids, all under the tender age of 10.

55:51.478 --> 55:54.176
They all play instruments and sing.

55:54.220 --> 55:56.178
They don't even know the
capital of their country...

56:19.985 --> 56:21.290
Hi, Mr. Sims.
This is Verity Hawkins

56:21.334 --> 56:23.075
calling you for, like,
the seventh time.

56:23.118 --> 56:25.599
I'm sorry, can you just...

56:25.643 --> 56:26.992
Give me a call back
when you get this message?

56:27.035 --> 56:29.037
Please? Thank you.

56:36.436 --> 56:39.657
- Is that...
- Yeah, that is.

56:41.572 --> 56:43.835
Um...

56:43.878 --> 56:47.186
Verity, April, what
are you poor dears doin' here?

56:47.229 --> 56:50.450
Mrs. traybol, hi.

56:50.494 --> 56:52.931
It was just so terrible
about Jonathan.

56:52.974 --> 56:55.629
Your family
has just suffered so much.

56:55.673 --> 57:00.242
If you need anything,
you just tell me.

57:00.286 --> 57:03.550
Are you here
to see Gary Sims, too?

57:03.594 --> 57:05.509
Yes, as a matter of fact, I am.

57:05.552 --> 57:07.249
Well, he's not here.

57:07.293 --> 57:09.382
Well, that's just great.

57:09.426 --> 57:10.731
He promised me pictures,

57:10.775 --> 57:14.256
and he hasn't been
returning my calls.

57:14.300 --> 57:15.954
I'm divorcing Eugene.

57:15.997 --> 57:17.956
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

57:17.999 --> 57:19.523
I'm not.

57:19.566 --> 57:20.698
He's cheating on me.

57:20.741 --> 57:22.874
Oh!

57:22.917 --> 57:25.746
With your
father's widow, no less!

57:25.790 --> 57:27.444
With Louise?

57:29.054 --> 57:30.577
Before they were married,

57:30.621 --> 57:34.146
I suspected that they were
carryin' on an affair.

57:34.189 --> 57:36.191
I would show you the pictures

57:36.235 --> 57:38.411
if I could get this man
on the phone.

57:38.455 --> 57:41.936
Some people have no
professional ethic, I swear.

57:41.980 --> 57:44.373
So, Jonathan actually had a
reason to be suspicious.

57:58.475 --> 58:00.085
Best I could do on short notice.

58:03.871 --> 58:06.265
They should be good, though,
unless you do something stupid.

58:14.055 --> 58:15.927
Thanks.

58:15.970 --> 58:18.277
How you plannin' on
gettin' through the border?

58:18.320 --> 58:20.758
Well, the border,

58:20.801 --> 58:23.848
it's, uh, it's not really
part of the plan.

58:23.891 --> 58:25.980
Really?

58:26.024 --> 58:27.895
I just gave you two passports.

58:31.377 --> 58:35.903
I think we're, uh,
just gonna hit the road.

58:35.947 --> 58:39.080
Really? So, hop
in a car and drive.

58:39.124 --> 58:42.606
- Yeah.
- Well, now you got me worried.

58:42.649 --> 58:43.781
You see, what if
there's roadblocks,

58:43.824 --> 58:45.434
checkpoints lookin' for you?

58:45.478 --> 58:49.047
- Any chance of that?
- Well, maybe.

58:49.090 --> 58:51.528
Well, maybe if they catch you,
they come lookin' for me.

58:51.571 --> 58:54.182
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

58:56.184 --> 58:57.969
Well, uh... ahem...

58:58.012 --> 59:00.754
how would, uh,
how would you do it?

59:00.798 --> 59:03.148
I figure I would take a sweet
little cruise down the river.

59:04.932 --> 59:07.587
And I would probably
take that ferry over there,

59:07.631 --> 59:10.155
take the ferry
over to the cruise ship,

59:10.198 --> 59:12.940
get me a nice little cabin
on the cruise ship,

59:12.984 --> 59:16.204
play shuffleboard and bingo
as I float to freedom.

59:18.032 --> 59:19.338
That's how I'd do it.

59:22.341 --> 59:25.736
I, uh, I'll keep that in mind.

59:27.651 --> 59:29.740
Thinner than that.

59:29.783 --> 59:31.611
You have to cut it thinner,
let me show you.

59:31.655 --> 59:37.182
Like this.
Like that and that.

59:37.225 --> 59:39.924
See? This thin? Okay?

59:42.056 --> 59:44.972
Oh, hi. I hope
you have a big appetite.

59:46.495 --> 59:49.150
Actually, I've lost my appetite.

59:50.978 --> 59:53.502
Louise, you are no longer
welcome in this house.

59:53.546 --> 59:56.201
Let me finish that
for you, Miss Louise.

59:57.768 --> 59:59.508
What did you just say?

01:00:00.814 --> 01:00:02.337
You're sleeping with Eugene.

01:00:04.905 --> 01:00:08.779
My father's been dead
barely a week.

01:00:08.822 --> 01:00:11.433
My personal life is my business

01:00:11.477 --> 01:00:15.699
and you have no right
to dictate how I live it.

01:00:15.742 --> 01:00:20.051
No, I don't have a right
dictating how you live it,

01:00:20.094 --> 01:00:23.228
but I do have a right
dictating where you live it,

01:00:23.271 --> 01:00:24.664
and you will not
be living it here.

01:00:24.708 --> 01:00:26.666
So, you can kindly
pack your bags

01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.537
and be out of here by morning.

01:00:31.453 --> 01:00:33.934
Okay.

01:00:40.419 --> 01:00:42.421
I'm sorry, I can't,
I can't, I can't.

01:00:42.464 --> 01:00:43.814
I can't take this.
I can't. I'm sorry.

01:00:43.857 --> 01:00:46.381
I'm putting this house
up for sale.

01:00:46.425 --> 01:00:48.209
I'm putting everything
on the auction block.

01:00:48.253 --> 01:00:50.734
I'm selling it piece by piece.

01:00:50.777 --> 01:00:54.259
I... I... let's just be done
with this, please.

01:01:12.059 --> 01:01:13.147
Verity?

01:01:16.890 --> 01:01:19.153
You okay?

01:01:19.197 --> 01:01:20.981
You know, I hate it when
people ask me that question.

01:01:26.813 --> 01:01:28.032
Look at me.
Are you okay?

01:01:31.818 --> 01:01:32.776
I'm great!

01:01:34.038 --> 01:01:37.128
I am absolutely great!

01:01:39.783 --> 01:01:43.612
You know, I just kicked
your mother out.

01:01:46.964 --> 01:01:48.748
I wasn't aware of that.

01:01:48.792 --> 01:01:49.749
Yeah.

01:01:51.185 --> 01:01:53.187

She's crazy.

01:01:56.147 --> 01:01:57.931
You want me gone?

01:01:57.975 --> 01:02:00.368
Okay, just say the word
and I'm out like that.

01:02:00.412 --> 01:02:02.762
You know what? It actually doesn't
matter because I am leaving tomorrow

01:02:02.806 --> 01:02:04.677
because there is nothing
left for me here.

01:02:09.900 --> 01:02:13.730
Well, I get it.

01:02:15.819 --> 01:02:21.955
Well... okay.

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:23.870
I guess the whole thing's
kaput, huh?

01:02:26.003 --> 01:02:27.656
I was just...

01:02:27.700 --> 01:02:32.009
I was just hoping
that we could spend

01:02:32.052 --> 01:02:33.967
a little bit more time
together, you know?

01:02:36.840 --> 01:02:41.801
It's just that I...
I've had a really long week,

01:02:41.845 --> 01:02:46.458
and I just would really, really
like to be alone right now, okay?

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:48.503
- Alone?
- Okay, okay?

01:02:55.728 --> 01:02:57.121

01:04:32.999 --> 01:04:35.262
Are you really
selling the house?

01:04:35.306 --> 01:04:37.177
Auctioning it.

01:04:37.221 --> 01:04:38.875
But it was important
to Jonathan.

01:04:38.918 --> 01:04:40.354
He wanted to keep it
in the family.

01:04:40.398 --> 01:04:43.401
Well, it's not important to me.

01:04:43.444 --> 01:04:46.578
So, you just ignore
his final wishes?

01:04:46.621 --> 01:04:49.450
And stay here?
There's nothing for me here.

01:04:49.494 --> 01:04:50.756
What about your family?

01:04:52.932 --> 01:04:54.891
My family is gone.

01:04:54.934 --> 01:04:57.023

for the exact same thing

01:05:02.899 --> 01:05:06.076
that everybody else did...
money. That's it.

such a bad thing after all.

01:16:13.743 --> 01:16:15.875
Okay, okay.

01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:17.529
I'm so sorry.
Verity...

01:16:17.573 --> 01:16:19.052
Hmmm?

01:16:19.096 --> 01:16:22.926
I think... I think he
tried to kill your father.

01:16:22.969 --> 01:16:24.536
What?

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.365
I think he's the one
who killed your dad.

01:16:27.408 --> 01:16:29.193
Oh, my God!

01:16:29.236 --> 01:16:31.108
I know.

01:16:31.151 --> 01:16:33.589
- Oh, my...
- I know. But it's over.

01:16:33.632 --> 01:16:35.025
Oh, my God!
Where's Cara?

01:16:35.068 --> 01:16:36.461
Where's Cara?
Where's Cara?

01:16:36.504 --> 01:16:37.636
- Where's Cara? Cara!
- Verity!

01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:39.029
Verity!

01:16:39.072 --> 01:16:42.772
- What?
- Verity, wait.

01:16:42.815 --> 01:16:44.817
What? No, no.
We have to call the police.

01:16:44.861 --> 01:16:46.558
- We have to call the police.
- No, no, no.

01:16:46.602 --> 01:16:48.734
Cara already called
the police, okay?

01:16:48.778 --> 01:16:50.823
- Okay.
- Okay? Okay?

01:16:50.867 --> 01:16:52.346
Okay.
Uh-huh. Okay.

01:16:52.390 --> 01:16:53.652
- It's going to be okay.
- Okay.

01:16:53.696 --> 01:16:55.175
- It's going to be okay.
- Okay.

01:16:55.219 --> 01:16:56.176
Okay.

01:17:07.274 --> 01:17:08.406
Verity.

01:17:11.409 --> 01:17:13.237
So why do you think
that he did it?

01:17:15.979 --> 01:17:17.502
Huh?

01:17:17.545 --> 01:17:19.722
Because he wanted the money.

01:17:19.765 --> 01:17:21.201
Just him?

01:17:22.594 --> 01:17:23.813
What do you mean?

01:17:25.945 --> 01:17:27.947
A couple of days
before my father died,

01:17:27.991 --> 01:17:29.819
your mother was caught
on a security camera

01:17:29.862 --> 01:17:31.734
buying a poison.

01:17:39.306 --> 01:17:44.834
Verity, that was
a prescription, okay?

01:17:44.877 --> 01:17:46.662
She has a deficiency.

01:17:53.146 --> 01:17:55.975
Look, I know you have been
through so much, okay.

01:17:56.019 --> 01:17:57.760
I am so, so sorry.

01:18:00.850 --> 01:18:02.373
I can imagine what you're
going through right now,

01:18:02.416 --> 01:18:03.809
and I want you to know

01:18:03.853 --> 01:18:05.637
that I'm going to be here
for you, okay?

01:18:05.681 --> 01:18:08.466
I'm here for you, okay?

01:18:08.509 --> 01:18:10.860
Everything's going to be okay.

01:18:10.903 --> 01:18:14.733
It's going to be okay, okay?

01:18:14.777 --> 01:18:16.909
We're going to get
through this together, honey.

01:18:16.953 --> 01:18:18.868
We're going to get
through this together.

01:18:18.911 --> 01:18:20.391
Oh, my God.

01:18:20.434 --> 01:18:22.175
What is it?

01:18:22.219 --> 01:18:25.222
Oh, my God!
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

01:18:25.265 --> 01:18:26.919
Come here.

01:18:26.963 --> 01:18:28.268

Now, listen,
you sniveling little brat,

01:18:30.618 --> 01:18:32.446
I wanted everything with you.

01:18:32.490 --> 01:18:35.580
We could have had a life, kids,
a bloody golden retriever.

01:18:37.800 --> 01:18:39.889
Because I really, really...

01:18:39.932 --> 01:18:42.456

every single thing up.

self-defense, huh?
