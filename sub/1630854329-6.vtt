01:00.435 --> 01:01.269
Hello?

01:01.352 --> 01:02.353
Hey, Dad!

01:02.437 --> 01:03.938
How is it?

01:04.522 --> 01:06.649
I wish you were here, Dad.

01:06.733 --> 01:09.861
You're a master when it comes to farming.

01:10.445 --> 01:12.072
That olive tree you pruned?

01:12.989 --> 01:13.823
It looks good.

01:13.907 --> 01:15.366
-Does it?
-Yes.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.494
How about the rose bushes, though?

01:17.577 --> 01:19.162
-The rose bushes?
-Yeah.

01:19.662 --> 01:20.705
Well…

01:21.915 --> 01:23.458
they could be better.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.794
Yes, yes.

01:26.920 --> 01:28.713
Wait, hold on, another thing…

01:32.884 --> 01:33.927
The doctor.

01:34.427 --> 01:36.387
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:36.471 --> 01:39.682
-We see him next week.
-And then that's it, right?

01:39.766 --> 01:42.227
Who knows, Dad.

01:42.852 --> 01:43.895
The--

01:44.854 --> 01:47.941
-Did you take your pills?
-Yes, I took the final one this morning.

01:48.566 --> 01:49.400
Good.

01:50.151 --> 01:51.444
-Papa…
-Huh?

01:51.528 --> 01:53.113
Only time will tell.

02:34.696 --> 02:36.406
I can't believe it.

02:36.990 --> 02:38.741
I can eat a Florentine steak again!

04:30.937 --> 04:32.772
Mamma! I did the scan…

04:34.065 --> 04:36.234
and it's all clear now.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.069
Hello?

04:39.028 --> 04:41.406
Mamma? You there?

04:44.742 --> 04:46.953
Your dad passed away.

04:48.913 --> 04:49.914
His heart gave out.

04:54.460 --> 04:55.795
But how can he be dead?

04:56.629 --> 04:58.631
We just spoke last week, Mamma…

04:58.715 --> 05:00.925
It happened yesterday, in the fields.

05:01.592 --> 05:05.013
I didn't call sooner
because I knew you had to do the scan.

05:05.888 --> 05:08.016
I didn't want to give you the bad news.

05:08.516 --> 05:10.852
Your health is important, my dear Lino.

05:15.064 --> 05:16.149
He loved you, son.

05:19.068 --> 05:20.862
-Mamma, I should come home.
-No.

05:20.945 --> 05:22.655
-No.
-No, Mamma, I should come home.

05:22.739 --> 05:25.825
There's nothing to be done.
The Mass is tomorrow.

05:28.745 --> 05:29.871
I can look after you.

05:31.331 --> 05:34.125
For me, knowing you're okay
is more than enough.

05:35.418 --> 05:38.129
Now you have to promise me
you'll put your health first.

05:38.212 --> 05:40.173
Yes.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.512
You are a blessing.
I am powerless against you.

19:03.433 --> 19:06.186
She's got strong lungs.
This is good.

19:08.564 --> 19:11.275
So, when is the christening?

19:12.901 --> 19:17.197
Uh, we're not sure about a christening,
at least not right now.

19:17.281 --> 19:21.201
We want Idalia
to find her own faith someday.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.287
I know my son says this.

19:23.370 --> 19:27.791
But you, you have to
make him see what's best for everyone.

19:27.875 --> 19:30.961
You have to work men a little.
You have to convince him.

19:31.545 --> 19:32.713
Talk to him.

19:34.047 --> 19:37.176
Our marriage doesn't work that way.

19:38.302 --> 19:40.262
All marriages work that way.

19:41.263 --> 19:42.806
Fine.

19:43.390 --> 19:48.520
Fine, we'll let my granddaughter's
soul hang in limbo, then.

19:49.730 --> 19:51.064
Well, goodbye then.

29:15.086 --> 29:16.671
…parsley.

30:29.035 --> 30:30.870
Do you like it?

30:32.705 --> 30:34.707
It's beautiful.

32:07.634 --> 32:10.386
It's Mr. Elephant.
Look how cute.

32:17.018 --> 32:18.561
From the top of the hill…

32:18.645 --> 32:20.772
…they could see all of Sicily.

32:21.564 --> 32:22.523
And the goat…

32:23.191 --> 32:26.444
…turned green
from eating all the vegetables!
