I was thinking.

01:01.448 --> 01:03.103
What do you want?

01:03.172 --> 01:05.862
- Well, there's no hot wire
around that river.

01:05.931 --> 01:07.482
We could leave them there
a month or so,

01:07.551 --> 01:09.172
but then they might cross.

01:09.241 --> 01:11.275
And God knows where they'll go.

01:11.344 --> 01:13.137
In pasture nine, there's a creek

01:13.206 --> 01:15.413
and a fence all
the way around it.

01:15.482 --> 01:18.413
We could leave 'em there
until November.

01:18.482 --> 01:20.724
- Well, nine it is.

01:20.793 --> 01:22.758
- You never wanted 'em in 12,
did you?

01:22.827 --> 01:24.482
- Well, all the world's
a test, son.

01:24.551 --> 01:26.413
Don't ever let it trick you
into thinking different.

01:28.586 --> 01:30.310
Why don't you meet me at
the Livestock Association office

01:30.379 --> 01:31.620
once you get 'em moving?

01:31.689 --> 01:33.620
- I was gonna help them
push 'em out.

01:33.689 --> 01:35.448
- Oh, I'm sure.

01:35.517 --> 01:37.551
You're about to learn how
little cowboys and ranchers

01:37.620 --> 01:39.172

It's the wranglers

Go through the east canyon
and up the fire road.

01:56.103 --> 01:57.344
Any questions?

01:57.413 --> 01:59.103
- There's no gate along
the fire road.

01:59.172 --> 02:00.551
We'd have to cut the fence.

02:00.620 --> 02:02.068
- Yeah, exactly.

02:02.137 --> 02:03.827
Then we'll fix it.

02:03.896 --> 02:07.241
- We push 'em across the river
and we could follow the creek...

02:07.310 --> 02:09.241
- Then we'd have to swim
100 cattle across the river.

02:09.310 --> 02:10.758
- Cows can swim.

02:10.827 --> 02:12.655
- Hey, I can't.
I don't know how to swim yet.

02:12.724 --> 02:14.620
- Do you know how
to shut the fuck up?

02:14.689 --> 02:16.551
He didn't ask you
your opinion.

02:16.620 --> 02:18.206
He asked if there was any
questions, and they're ain't!

Now get your asses
out in that field.

02:22.275 --> 02:23.482

You tell me what you need
and I'll take care of it,

02:40.793 --> 02:44.172
but don't question me.

02:44.241 --> 02:46.379
- Well, you said
they need to respect me.

02:46.448 --> 02:48.172
- You let me handle
the wranglers

02:48.241 --> 02:50.137
and you'll have both.

02:50.206 --> 02:52.137
That's my job.

02:56.275 --> 02:58.206
- All right, well,

to pasture nine,

03:00.206 --> 03:01.793

03:01.862 --> 03:03.172
- I don't choose the way.

03:03.241 --> 03:06.172
Make sure no one
questions yours.

03:19.310 --> 03:22.137
- You're a hand long enough,
you know who to talk to.

03:22.206 --> 03:24.724

to do it different.

Montana's got under my skin.

- Check?

04:59.517 --> 05:01.344
- Big check.

Jamie, sorry
to keep you waiting.

05:43.275 --> 05:45.137
Will you pull that up, please?

You're getting the crash course
in politics today.

06:06.275 --> 06:08.137
Always remember this, Jamie.

06:08.206 --> 06:10.172
Running for office
and holding the office

06:10.241 --> 06:12.103
are two very
different things.

06:12.172 --> 06:14.758
Holding the office
requires honor, integrity,

06:14.827 --> 06:17.137
tempering every act
with wisdom.

06:17.206 --> 06:20.103
Running for office requires
none of those things.

06:20.172 --> 06:22.448
It's a zero sum game

06:22.517 --> 06:25.137

that matters.

06:41.206 --> 06:43.172
- Welcome to really
running for office.

06:46.310 --> 06:48.068

most certainly.

they deserve from your office.

07:27.793 --> 07:30.551

We can drag that out for a bit.

But you can't hold my office
without the badge.

15:46.689 --> 15:49.275
a variety originating
in Tramin,

15:49.344 --> 15:52.068
a German-speaking village
in northern Italy.

15:53.724 --> 15:55.241
- My father fought
those bastards.

15:55.310 --> 15:57.310
Now we're drinking
their wine.

15:57.379 --> 15:58.620
- Your wine flight.

15:58.689 --> 16:02.137
- I think these
are for you.

16:04.758 --> 16:06.724
- I'm gonna need
all of them?

16:06.793 --> 16:09.379
- Probably.

16:12.379 --> 16:15.068
- Well-played, John.

16:15.137 --> 16:18.689
- Oh, we've just
started playing.

16:18.758 --> 16:22.551
I told you to find
another Attorney General.

16:22.620 --> 16:24.586
Now I found one for you.
- Yes.

16:24.655 --> 16:26.586
You put me in a position
where now I have no choice

16:26.655 --> 16:28.724
but to fight you.

16:28.793 --> 16:31.344
The Attorney General's supposed
to do my bidding, John,

16:31.413 --> 16:33.103
not yours.

16:33.172 --> 16:36.034
Jamie was...he was just
such a convenient way

16:36.103 --> 16:38.068
to serve both our needs.

16:38.137 --> 16:39.965
- Anyone blows him by now.

16:40.034 --> 16:42.137
The only thing that matters
to him is approval.

16:42.206 --> 16:45.931
Once he's elected,
we can't give him that anymore.

16:46.000 --> 16:47.517
Popularity controls him,

16:47.586 --> 16:51.310
and then you know
the consequences of that.

16:55.034 --> 16:58.206
I'm gonna get him
to step down.

16:58.275 --> 16:59.482
- And how are you
gonna do that?

16:59.551 --> 17:01.137
- How I do it
is not important.

17:01.206 --> 17:04.205
What matters is you
don't fight me on this.

17:04.275 --> 17:07.550
But your opponent,
I choose next.

17:07.619 --> 17:11.034
- And so the pack
turns on itself.

17:14.723 --> 17:18.172
Guess that was inevitable.

17:18.241 --> 17:20.275
- You got in the middle
of family.

17:20.344 --> 17:24.310
- Don't you dare
wave that flag at me.

17:24.378 --> 17:26.723
We don't have families.

17:26.792 --> 17:31.724
We have employees
we're related to.

17:31.793 --> 17:33.724
Can you name the last time
that you had a conversation

17:33.793 --> 17:36.551
with one of your children
about how their day went

17:36.620 --> 17:40.034
or how they feel or...

17:40.103 --> 17:41.310
what they dream of?

17:44.310 --> 17:48.344
Yeah.

17:48.413 --> 17:51.000
I can't either.

17:56.172 --> 17:57.655
You're supposed
to sip it, John.

17:57.724 --> 17:59.551
- Not drinking it
for the taste.

18:05.310 --> 18:08.275
Their mother died
in front of them, Lynelle.

18:08.344 --> 18:11.000
That's how every
day goes for 'em.

18:11.068 --> 18:12.965
Don't have to ask
my kids how it went.

18:13.034 --> 18:16.068
You don't have to ask
yours either...

18:16.137 --> 18:19.000
do you?

18:19.068 --> 18:20.379
- No.

18:25.034 --> 18:26.206
Well, this isn't the way

18:26.275 --> 18:28.034
I thought life
was gonna turn out.

18:28.103 --> 18:31.482
I gotta tell you, John.

18:33.482 --> 18:35.275
- Well, it's worked out pretty
much how I figured it would,

18:35.344 --> 18:39.758
except for the...
losing her part.

18:42.034 --> 18:44.137
Never saw that coming.

18:53.103 --> 18:55.000
- Would you like
another flight?

19:02.724 --> 19:04.103
- Fuck it.

19:07.137 --> 19:10.206
You didn't hear that.
- No, ma'am.

19:22.551 --> 19:25.137
[chuckles]

19:35.482 --> 19:37.103
- Lock.
Take your hat off.

20:00.413 --> 20:04.172
John...John?

20:04.241 --> 20:08.965
You know what?
I'm sorry.

20:09.034 --> 20:11.137
I just...

20:22.724 --> 20:26.931
Do you think you'll
ever fall in love again?

20:27.000 --> 20:30.379
- No.

20:30.448 --> 20:33.000
- Me neither.

20:36.275 --> 20:40.000
And that's supposed to be
the only thing you live for.

20:41.586 --> 20:44.103
- Then you have children

20:44.172 --> 20:47.172
and the living for
yourself part's all over.

20:54.448 --> 20:56.172
We're not screwing, are we?

20:56.241 --> 20:58.000
[chuckles]

21:02.137 --> 21:04.620
- No.

21:07.275 --> 21:09.620
You all right with that?

21:09.689 --> 21:11.241
- I'm 63 years old, Lynelle.

21:11.310 --> 21:14.206
Takes everything
a while to wake up

21:14.275 --> 21:16.620
and a while to go away.

21:16.689 --> 21:21.482
Just need to know
the direction.

21:21.551 --> 21:24.275
Too old for surprises,
sweetheart.

21:24.344 --> 21:27.103
- Don't sell yourself short.

21:32.413 --> 21:34.517
I just miss him.

21:40.068 --> 21:41.620
You'd think that,
after 10 years,

21:41.689 --> 21:44.103
that would fade.

21:47.137 --> 21:49.413
- Well, I guess that's how you
know it was true love, honey.

21:55.068 --> 21:57.965
- Yeah.

22:10.689 --> 22:12.551
- What are you doing?

22:12.620 --> 22:14.310
- Feeding the horses.

22:14.379 --> 22:17.413
- Yeah, I know
what you're doing.

22:17.482 --> 22:19.517
Why are you doing it?

22:19.586 --> 22:22.275
- It's my job.

22:22.344 --> 22:24.310
- I wish you
hadn't let Kayce win.

22:24.379 --> 22:26.275
- Who says I did?

22:29.965 --> 22:31.965
What would I have won, Beth?

22:37.034 --> 22:39.137
- I wish you'd
beaten his ass so bad

22:39.206 --> 22:42.068
that he left
and never come back.

22:42.137 --> 22:45.655
It would have been
the best thing for him, and you.

22:45.724 --> 22:47.068
- Do you think
this bothers me?

22:47.137 --> 22:49.206
It's the highlight
of my day.

22:49.275 --> 22:51.551
Glad to have
this chore back.

22:54.034 --> 22:55.896
- This is exactly
what you were doing

22:55.965 --> 22:58.172
the first time I saw you,

22:58.241 --> 23:01.068
right here too.

23:01.137 --> 23:03.551
- Well, the more
things change.

23:06.482 --> 23:09.241
- If Kayce's in charge,
things are only gonna get worse.

23:12.137 --> 23:14.103
There are other ranches, Rip.

23:14.172 --> 23:16.655
- Not for me, there ain't.

23:23.275 --> 23:25.379
- Look what loyalty's
given you, huh?

23:25.448 --> 23:27.551
- Yeah.

23:30.586 --> 23:33.448
It's awful, ain't it?

23:47.931 --> 23:51.931
[chatter]

24:00.310 --> 24:03.068
- The issue is Chevron
already secured the land.

24:03.137 --> 24:05.137
- Well, have they broken
ground yet, Mark?

24:05.206 --> 24:07.862
- My understanding is there's
an agreement to terms.

24:07.931 --> 24:10.103
- Do they hold the deed?

24:10.172 --> 24:12.000
- Ah, it's unclear.

24:12.068 --> 24:13.206
- Well, these are things
you need to know

24:13.275 --> 24:14.620
before you call, Mark.

24:14.689 --> 24:16.517
I can't stop them
without information

24:16.586 --> 24:18.448
and, so far, you aren't
giving me any.

24:18.517 --> 24:19.931
- We'll have to call
you back, Mark.

24:20.000 --> 24:21.586
- No worries.
[line clicks]

24:21.655 --> 24:23.517
- What?

24:23.586 --> 24:25.000
- A casino!

24:30.896 --> 24:33.551
- A 400-room hotel 30 minutes
from the National Park.

24:35.896 --> 24:40.413
Who the fuck is Dan Jenkins?

25:31.965 --> 25:35.931
- There's a cop walkin' in.

25:36.000 --> 25:39.000
- Fuck! Leave it.
Just leave it.

25:46.896 --> 25:48.827
- [grunts]

25:48.896 --> 25:50.068
- I'll grab these.

25:50.137 --> 25:52.137
You run inside
and get the fence clips.

25:53.517 --> 25:56.068
- You just tell me
what to do, Gomer?

25:56.137 --> 25:57.827
- Well, I just...

25:57.896 --> 26:00.517
They're heavy.
You don't have gloves.

26:00.586 --> 26:03.931
- This is the job.
I do the job.

26:04.000 --> 26:05.586
You get the clips,

26:05.655 --> 26:07.931
and some jeans that fit.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.206
You look like Eminem
at a hayride.

26:12.620 --> 26:14.931
- I'm just trying to be nice.

26:23.241 --> 26:26.517
- Excuse me.
Sir, would you mind helping me?

26:26.586 --> 26:28.482
Fuck you, old man.
- Asshole.

26:28.551 --> 26:30.379
- Look at this.

26:30.448 --> 26:33.344
Look at this! Jimmy!

26:33.413 --> 26:34.896
- Hey Ray.
Hey Blake.

26:34.965 --> 26:36.551
- Where the fuck you been?

26:36.620 --> 26:38.448
- Just working.

26:38.517 --> 26:39.931
- Working?

26:40.000 --> 26:41.137
- Yeah, I work
at the Yellowstone.

26:41.206 --> 26:43.137
- Oh, the Yellowstone.

26:43.206 --> 26:44.275
- Can't ride no fuckin' horse.

26:44.344 --> 26:46.965
- Can now.
- Good.

26:47.034 --> 26:49.448
You can pay me the money
you owe me, motherfucker.

26:51.413 --> 26:52.965
Better yet,

26:53.034 --> 26:56.551
you can go on a little
shopping spree for me.

26:56.620 --> 27:00.137
That's right.
You don't need a list.

27:00.206 --> 27:04.827
You know exactly
what to get.

27:04.896 --> 27:06.448
Nice hat.

27:09.586 --> 27:12.000
- Dipshit.

27:14.206 --> 27:17.103
[atmospheric music]

27:59.379 --> 28:00.344
- Go back inside!

28:00.413 --> 28:02.137
- Fuck you.

28:02.206 --> 28:06.000
- Jimmy? Go back inside!

28:06.068 --> 28:07.517
- Fucker.

28:11.965 --> 28:13.137
- Fuck you!

28:19.896 --> 28:20.931
- What happened to you?

28:21.000 --> 28:22.172
- We gotta go!

28:27.551 --> 28:29.931
Drive, drive!

28:30.000 --> 28:31.241
Fuck!

28:31.310 --> 28:33.241
- Come on, motherfucker!
Get out here, you!

28:33.310 --> 28:35.344
- Oh, fuck!

28:35.413 --> 28:38.000
Bitch, come here!

28:38.068 --> 28:40.448
- Jimmy, close your eyes!
- Get out here.

28:40.517 --> 28:43.482
- Ahhh! My eyes!
- What the fuck!

28:43.551 --> 28:44.896
- You're welcome!

28:44.965 --> 28:46.551
- Go, go, go, go, go!

28:49.655 --> 28:51.793
Fuck! Why did you do that?
Are you crazy?

28:51.862 --> 28:54.827
- [groans]

28:54.896 --> 28:57.137
- Oh, fuck.

28:59.551 --> 29:01.000
He's fuckin' dead!

29:08.413 --> 29:10.379
- Push up.
Push on my hand.

29:12.172 --> 29:13.793
Good, good.

29:13.862 --> 29:15.310
- Oh, that is exhausting.

29:15.379 --> 29:16.827
- Drop your leg down.

29:16.896 --> 29:18.482
Wait'll we start swimming laps.

29:18.551 --> 29:21.827
- When we start swimming laps,
I think I'm healed.

29:21.896 --> 29:24.827
- Go ahead and lift it up again.

29:24.896 --> 29:26.068
You grew up by Broken Rock?

29:28.482 --> 29:29.827
- What about you?

29:29.896 --> 29:31.551
- Crow res.
You get out there much?

29:31.620 --> 29:34.862
- I don't get anywhere much.

29:34.931 --> 29:36.310
- Now go ahead
and drop your leg again.

29:39.551 --> 29:41.931
Ever been to an
Indian relay race?

29:42.000 --> 29:43.344
- When I was young.

29:43.413 --> 29:45.000
- That's my passion.

29:45.068 --> 29:47.310
- Sounds like a good way
to need physical therapy.

29:47.379 --> 29:50.068
- Ha!
Yeah, only if you fall off.

29:53.448 --> 29:55.379
- Uh, time's up.
- Right.

29:59.448 --> 30:01.965
- Oh, I can do it.
- Okay.

30:07.344 --> 30:09.724
- I'm married,
just so you know.

30:09.793 --> 30:11.137
- Saw the ring.

30:11.206 --> 30:14.241
- Not that I, just, um...

30:14.310 --> 30:16.724
I'm married.

30:16.793 --> 30:19.758
- Got it.
3 p.m. tomorrow?

30:19.827 --> 30:21.931
- Yeah.

30:39.862 --> 30:42.241
- What the...

30:47.068 --> 30:51.103
Jumping Jesus, what the hell?

30:51.172 --> 30:52.724
- There was these, uh...

30:52.793 --> 30:55.724
- A can of bear spray
went off by accident.

30:55.793 --> 30:58.862
- Jimmy, you ain't
got sense enough

30:58.931 --> 31:00.827
to pour warm piss
out of your boot.

31:00.896 --> 31:02.517
- Like I know that's an insult.

31:02.586 --> 31:05.379
I just don't understand how.

31:05.448 --> 31:08.482
- Don't stop scrubbing
until the smell's gone.

31:08.551 --> 31:11.310
- Yeah.

31:11.379 --> 31:15.862
Like I'm aware of the insult.
I just...

31:15.931 --> 31:17.827
why is there piss
in my boot?

31:17.896 --> 31:20.275
- You're so dumb,
it's almost attractive.

31:22.896 --> 31:24.241
- Wait, really?

31:24.310 --> 31:26.034
- Understood attractive
though, didn't you?

31:26.103 --> 31:27.896
Men...

31:27.965 --> 31:30.827
I swear I could jack one
off at a funeral.

32:08.896 --> 32:13.344
- That is impressive!

32:13.413 --> 32:16.413
- You're making quite the splash
in Montana, aren't you?

32:16.482 --> 32:18.103
- Now that's smart,

32:18.172 --> 32:20.896
making the casino separate
from the hotel, right?

32:20.965 --> 32:23.379
And what are these?
Are these houses?

32:23.448 --> 32:25.172
- Yeah.

32:25.241 --> 32:26.896
- A planned
second home community

32:26.965 --> 32:30.137
with it's own hotel and casino.
Now that is smart.

32:30.206 --> 32:32.689
Utterly classless.

32:32.758 --> 32:34.827
But smart.

32:34.896 --> 32:37.689
- You must be the guy.

32:37.758 --> 32:39.034
- What guy would that be?

32:39.103 --> 32:42.034
- The guy that fucked
with John Dutton.

32:42.103 --> 32:45.793
I understand learning
not to do that was a...

32:45.862 --> 32:47.965
painful lesson.

32:48.034 --> 32:49.758
- So you're friends
with John Dutton, huh?

32:49.827 --> 32:51.206
- We know of him.

32:51.275 --> 32:53.896
- Oh, we've never met him.

32:53.965 --> 32:55.724
- You see,
thriving in Montana

32:55.793 --> 32:58.724
is all about staying
in your lane.

32:58.793 --> 33:00.965
We don't go in his
and he's never been in ours,

33:01.034 --> 33:03.931
but you have.

33:05.482 --> 33:06.793
- Now how did I do that?

33:06.862 --> 33:07.931
- Partnering with
an Indian tribe

33:08.000 --> 33:10.896
opening an off-reservation
casino.

33:10.965 --> 33:13.896
- Oh, but it won't be
off-reservation for long.

33:13.965 --> 33:16.172
Because annexing
this land into the res

33:16.241 --> 33:19.275
is the first thing
that he's going to do.

33:19.344 --> 33:22.034
- I assume he purchased the land
instead of leasing.

33:22.103 --> 33:25.827
And I assume he's
paying you the profits?

33:25.896 --> 33:29.275
Oh, well...

33:29.344 --> 33:31.724
Any money you've received
was an advance on construction,

33:31.793 --> 33:33.137
which he will want back

33:33.206 --> 33:34.827
as soon as he nullifies
your agreement.

33:34.896 --> 33:35.896
Just a guess, but...

33:35.965 --> 33:37.724
- That's what we'd do.

33:37.793 --> 33:39.172
If we were trying
to steal from you.

33:42.931 --> 33:45.000
- Rocky Mountain
Gas and Casino.

33:45.068 --> 33:47.379
That's owned
by the Beck Brothers.

33:47.448 --> 33:49.379
I'm assuming that
that's you.

33:49.448 --> 33:52.344
I'm just guessing that
you don't like competition.

33:52.413 --> 33:56.758
Well, let me tell you something,
you red-necked fucks!

33:56.827 --> 33:58.724
I'm so tired of you bullies

33:58.793 --> 34:02.172
with your bolo ties
and Lucchese boots.

34:02.241 --> 34:04.724
If you got a problem, file.

34:04.793 --> 34:07.172
Take me to court.

34:07.241 --> 34:09.896
I'll take the Pepsi challenge
with your backwoods lawyer

34:09.965 --> 34:12.516
any day of the fuckin' week.

34:12.585 --> 34:14.447
- You know, in addition
to running Rocky Mountain,

34:14.516 --> 34:17.310
my brother's also the head
of the Montana Liquor Board.

34:17.379 --> 34:20.413
Now do you recall

34:20.482 --> 34:24.896
applying for your liquor license
through us, right?

34:24.965 --> 34:27.034
- I will be revoking
that tomorrow.

34:27.103 --> 34:28.931
And, of course,

34:29.000 --> 34:31.827
I will never issue one
for this new venture.

34:31.896 --> 34:33.757
- And that is
just the beginning

34:33.827 --> 34:36.103
of how we're gonna
fuck with you.

34:36.172 --> 34:37.757
- I suggest you find a way

34:37.827 --> 34:39.724
to extricate yourself
from this deal.

34:39.793 --> 34:41.447
- And make a new deal with us.

34:41.516 --> 34:44.275
Hell, we'd love
to build a casino here.

34:45.827 --> 34:49.103
- Well, you got
lots to think about.

34:55.034 --> 34:56.862
- Think fast.

35:02.068 --> 35:04.206
- Fuckers.

35:04.275 --> 35:08.758
This town, fuckin' place.

35:08.827 --> 35:11.172
You wanna play dirty,

35:11.241 --> 35:13.000
let's play fucking dirty!

35:19.000 --> 35:21.931
- I don't understand
the dilemma.

35:22.000 --> 35:26.413
- My campaign cannot be funded
by my father's enemies.

35:26.482 --> 35:27.827
That is the dilemma.

35:27.896 --> 35:30.344
- Thomas Rainwater
is a good man.

35:30.413 --> 35:32.758
- Nevertheless,
he's an enemy.

35:32.827 --> 35:35.655
- You should really
analyze that.

35:35.724 --> 35:38.413
Okay, so we form
a political action committee.

35:38.482 --> 35:39.862
No one knows where
the money's coming from.

35:39.931 --> 35:42.862
- Everyone knows.
- What?

35:42.931 --> 35:45.241
- Defying my father
to run is one thing.

35:45.310 --> 35:46.896
Running against him,

35:46.965 --> 35:50.000
financed by a man who has
attacked our family,

35:50.068 --> 35:51.655
that's something
else entirely.

35:51.724 --> 35:53.241
- So what are you saying?

35:58.793 --> 36:01.931
- I don't think I can do it.

36:03.206 --> 36:06.000
- Hey, you need funding

36:06.068 --> 36:07.965
or you will lose.

36:09.068 --> 36:10.758
I'm not seeing a lot of donors

36:10.827 --> 36:15.068
running to our campaign office
with donations.

36:15.137 --> 36:17.482
- I think this is too much.

36:19.517 --> 36:22.758
- You know what you need to do?

36:22.827 --> 36:26.931
You need to find your compass.

36:27.000 --> 36:30.758
Because if where your
campaign gets its funding

36:30.827 --> 36:33.206
has you all twisted in knots,

36:33.275 --> 36:36.724
just wait until
you're in office.

36:36.793 --> 36:38.896
You don't know
the meaning of compromise.

36:43.896 --> 36:45.758
- I need to go for a walk.

37:18.034 --> 37:19.482
Hello?

37:21.137 --> 37:22.758
Hel--

37:26.275 --> 37:27.827
- For someone with no spine,

37:27.896 --> 37:29.344
you sure got a lot of balls.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.068
- I need you to forget

37:35.137 --> 37:38.620
about how we feel
about each other

37:38.689 --> 37:42.379
and remember one thing.

37:42.448 --> 37:44.068
We're family.

37:53.827 --> 37:56.103
- I love how people think
that word entitles them

37:56.172 --> 37:59.275
to absolution from the people
whose lives they ruin.

38:01.413 --> 38:02.793
We owe you nothing.

38:02.862 --> 38:04.896
- Goddamn it!
I'm at...

38:07.310 --> 38:09.793
Can you please attempt

38:09.862 --> 38:12.344
to resemble something human,

38:12.413 --> 38:15.137
listen to me,

38:15.206 --> 38:17.448
and give me some
fucking guidance here?

38:17.517 --> 38:19.310
- How'd you fuck him
this time?

38:19.379 --> 38:21.793
- I didn't fuck anything.

38:21.862 --> 38:24.172
I ran for the office
he told me to run for.

38:24.241 --> 38:27.241
And you chose someone
to run against me.

38:27.310 --> 38:29.068
- Hmm.

38:29.137 --> 38:31.965
Chose well, didn't I?

38:32.034 --> 38:34.655
Maybe when she's in office,
she'll ask you to clerk.

38:34.724 --> 38:38.758
No one researches
like you, Jamie.

38:38.827 --> 38:42.068
- I have a donor
willing to fund my campaign.

38:42.137 --> 38:43.655
- Let me guess.

38:43.724 --> 38:45.103
This Russian wants you
to do a Facebook blast.

38:45.172 --> 38:47.206
- Hey, this is my life, Beth.

38:47.275 --> 38:49.758
I'm asking for you to...

38:51.241 --> 38:53.413
Here.

38:53.482 --> 38:56.724
This is my donor.

39:07.413 --> 39:11.758
- Jamie, you're not
a politician, okay?

39:11.827 --> 39:14.137
Politicians believe that they
can manage peoples' lives

39:14.206 --> 39:15.724
better than they can.

39:15.793 --> 39:18.344
The best politicians
are narcissists.

39:18.413 --> 39:20.965
The very best should
probably be committed.

39:21.034 --> 39:22.206
You aren't that.

39:24.793 --> 39:27.206
Let's be honest, you don't know
who the fuck you are.

39:28.931 --> 39:31.793
And you're looking
for the world to tell you.

39:31.862 --> 39:34.793
You reek of desperation

39:34.862 --> 39:37.827
and they can smell it.

39:40.724 --> 39:43.344
They will pull you,
they will twist you.

39:43.413 --> 39:46.310
And they will tear you
into tiny pieces.

39:48.379 --> 39:50.275
And our father with you.

39:56.689 --> 39:58.793
- So what do I do?

39:58.862 --> 40:01.344
- You think about everyone
else in your life, but you.

40:06.310 --> 40:09.034
And you do
what's best for them.

40:40.000 --> 40:42.965
- Hey.

40:47.379 --> 40:50.620
- I can't do it.

40:50.689 --> 40:53.724
I won't do it.

40:55.655 --> 40:58.586
- Okay.

40:58.655 --> 41:02.689
We'll try and find the money
from somewhere else.

41:02.758 --> 41:03.827
I don't know where.

41:03.896 --> 41:07.206
- It's not just
about the money.

41:09.275 --> 41:11.310
I don't want
to play this dirty.

41:11.379 --> 41:13.137
- Jamie,

41:13.206 --> 41:16.241
you've been playing this dirty
your entire career.

41:16.310 --> 41:19.275
- No, no.

41:19.344 --> 41:21.758
I have reacted to
the situations before me.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.310
I didn't initiate them

41:23.379 --> 41:27.310
and I certainly didn't
do any of it for me.

41:31.103 --> 41:33.758
To beat her,
I have to attack him

41:33.827 --> 41:36.275
because there is nothing
about her to attack.

41:38.000 --> 41:41.275
- Yes.

41:41.344 --> 41:45.206
- I won't do that.

41:45.275 --> 41:48.586
I've made up my mind.

41:48.655 --> 41:53.103
- So first hint
of opposition,

41:53.172 --> 41:54.896
and you just quit?

42:03.793 --> 42:08.137
Your sister was right.

42:08.206 --> 42:09.827
What a chicken heart!

42:18.931 --> 42:20.344
I need you to leave.

42:20.413 --> 42:23.241
- [sighs]
The ultimatum never ends.

42:23.310 --> 42:25.241
So if I quit,
I don't get you.

42:25.310 --> 42:28.689
- If you quit,
what do I get?

42:28.758 --> 42:30.724
What are you
going to do, Jamie?

42:30.793 --> 42:32.758
Are you gonna open up a
little law firm in town

42:32.827 --> 42:35.862
and drum up DUI cases?

42:35.931 --> 42:37.586
No.

42:37.655 --> 42:39.068
You're going to go home

42:39.137 --> 42:40.689
and work side by side

42:40.758 --> 42:43.034
with your
suicide-waiting-to-happen sister

42:43.103 --> 42:46.620
and your monster father.
So go.

42:46.689 --> 42:49.034
Tuck tail, Jamie.

42:49.103 --> 42:51.000
Get the fuck
out of my apartment.

43:08.206 --> 43:09.655
- What the...?

43:09.724 --> 43:11.827
- Gator?
- Yep.

43:11.896 --> 43:13.655
- What the fuck is that?

43:13.724 --> 43:15.620
- Grilled octopus.

43:15.689 --> 43:17.310
- Mediterranean diet, Daddy.

43:17.379 --> 43:18.931
If I have to eat another steak,

43:19.000 --> 43:20.310
they'll have to do
my next colonic

43:20.379 --> 43:22.068
with a fuckin' fire hose.

43:22.137 --> 43:23.896
- It's good. Try it.

43:23.965 --> 43:26.241
- Pass me the potatoes.

43:36.310 --> 43:38.379
How was your day?
- It was good.

43:38.448 --> 43:40.724
Acquisitions are going fine.

43:40.793 --> 43:42.689
I have to walk you through
the profit structure, but...

43:42.758 --> 43:45.172
- That's not what I meant.
I meant...

43:45.241 --> 43:47.344
how was it?

43:57.724 --> 44:00.620
- Sobriety is bliss.

44:00.689 --> 44:03.448
What can I tell you?

44:06.689 --> 44:08.758
- How about you?

44:08.827 --> 44:10.689
- I don't want
to talk about it.

44:10.758 --> 44:12.068
- That's what
you always say.

44:12.137 --> 44:13.758
- Well, when I have a
day worth talking about,

44:13.827 --> 44:15.103
I'll shout it
from the damn rooftop.

44:20.793 --> 44:22.620
- That any good?

44:22.689 --> 44:25.000
- I don't care what I eat.

44:37.862 --> 44:39.793
- I withdrew from the race.

44:45.793 --> 44:48.344
- You hungry?

44:56.655 --> 44:57.931
- I'll make you a plate.

45:10.793 --> 45:11.862
- Where you been?

45:11.931 --> 45:14.931
- [giggles]

45:21.896 --> 45:24.758
[laughs loudly]

45:31.655 --> 45:33.724
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

45:41.931 --> 45:44.896
[soft guitar plays]
