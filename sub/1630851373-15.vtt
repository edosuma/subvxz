00:07.268 --> 00:09.922
Mason, you ever think about
applying with the CFD?

00:09.966 --> 00:11.054
CFD won't hire felons.

00:11.098 --> 00:12.273
I got you an interview

00:12.316 --> 00:14.188
with the St. Paul
Fire Department.

00:14.231 --> 00:15.667
I wanna keep
being you and me.

00:15.711 --> 00:20.150
Mm, that's why we have
plane tickets and Facetime.

00:20.194 --> 00:22.326
How you doing
with this Casey situation?

00:22.370 --> 00:25.721
Things might be different,
but we're still us.

00:25.764 --> 00:29.072
There is a lieutenant spot
open on Truck 72.

00:29.116 --> 00:30.595
I told Boden I want it.

00:30.639 --> 00:33.816
You are not leaving 81
to go over to 72, because I am.

00:33.859 --> 00:36.732
I'm just glad I can
keep your seat warm for you.

00:40.127 --> 00:43.826
First shift
as permanent lieutenant.

00:43.869 --> 00:45.958
How does that feel?

00:46.002 --> 00:49.049
Three minutes under my belt,
and no major mistakes.

00:49.092 --> 00:51.225
I'm feeling good.

00:51.268 --> 00:54.358
Well, you have
a major decision to make

00:54.402 --> 00:56.708
about that empty slot on Truck.

00:56.752 --> 00:59.537
I do, so I have floaters
coming in the next two shifts,

00:59.581 --> 01:01.409
both of them
highly recommended.

01:01.452 --> 01:03.498
So today is Kim Rossi,

01:03.541 --> 01:05.326
she's a couple years out
of the academy,

01:05.369 --> 01:07.589
and Chief Walker says
she checks all the boxes.

01:07.632 --> 01:09.199
Sounds good.

01:09.243 --> 01:14.030
Yes, but I would love any
input that you have about it.

01:14.074 --> 01:16.163
Well,
you don't want to rush it,

01:16.206 --> 01:18.556
because you need
to find the right fit.

01:18.600 --> 01:20.645
But you also want to find
someone as quickly as possible

01:20.689 --> 01:22.517
so that your team
can start to gel.

01:26.086 --> 01:28.697
That's all I was going to say.

01:28.740 --> 01:31.003
Oh. No big deal.

01:31.047 --> 01:33.702
I just thought you would add

01:33.745 --> 01:37.836
some wise words of advice
on making the choice.

01:37.880 --> 01:39.795
It is your decision to make,

the right one.

09:43.800 --> 09:45.585
Yes, Mason. He's great.

09:45.628 --> 09:47.456
But he has a criminal record,

09:47.499 --> 09:48.979

join the CFD.

09:49.023 --> 09:52.548
Yeah, his buddy stole a car
for a joyride

09:52.592 --> 09:54.942

and Mason got caught up in it.

09:54.985 --> 09:56.813
But he went to a formal review,

09:56.857 --> 09:58.641
and he got the, you know,
record expunged.

09:58.685 --> 10:01.470
Yeah, but we got him
a job in St. Paul.

10:01.513 --> 10:03.690

10:03.733 --> 10:06.997

10:07.041 --> 10:10.261

he took some time off,

10:10.305 --> 10:12.916
did the CFD test,
he went through the academy.

Mason would fit in here.

10:18.356 --> 10:21.490

you going to bat for him,

10:24.667 --> 10:26.669

- Likewise.

25:23.783 --> 25:26.307
Sykes was over at 130

25:26.350 --> 25:27.874
Big mistake,
shutting down that house,

25:27.917 --> 25:30.006

Sure, yeah.

25:36.970 --> 25:39.886
So what type is he?

25:39.929 --> 25:42.323
Uh, "The Eagle Scout."

25:42.366 --> 25:44.847
Common traits:
solid firefighter,

25:44.891 --> 25:46.545
hard worker, straight arrow.

25:46.588 --> 25:49.635
But don't expect
belly laughs from this guy.

25:49.678 --> 25:52.812
- Come on.
- Sounds on the money again.

25:52.855 --> 25:54.291

come up with that.

25:54.335 --> 25:55.815
No, no.
I'm not buying it.

25:55.858 --> 25:57.120
Mm, you don't know.

Uh, thanks for letting me
ride, Lieutenant.

25:59.862 --> 26:02.212
I hope Herrmann

26:02.256 --> 26:04.040
You think he
can push me around?

26:04.084 --> 26:05.825
No, guess not.

26:05.868 --> 26:07.740
He's kept in touch
since I left for Minnesota,

26:07.783 --> 26:10.394
You know, such a stand-up guy,
you know?

26:10.438 --> 26:12.353
When he suggested
the ride-along,

26:12.396 --> 26:13.876
you know, I had to come.

26:13.920 --> 26:15.530

from you guys.

26:15.574 --> 26:18.315
We really are happy
to have you here.

26:22.058 --> 26:24.321

26:24.365 --> 26:26.672
who could conceivably
have a beef with OFI.

26:26.715 --> 26:30.197
Basically any suspect
from the last decade

who isn't dead or in prison.

26:31.807 --> 26:33.548

even if the prosecutors

26:35.506 --> 26:36.595
couldn't make the case.

27:04.318 --> 27:06.146
Call came in
from a blocked number.

27:06.189 --> 27:08.539
It's one of the reasons
why we took it so seriously.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.454

He served 18 months
for a class 2 felony.

When I hung up that Facetime

I just got hit
with this wave of all

37:16.364 --> 37:18.801
the things

That warmth, you know?

The way he could be so strong
but also so kind, and...

He has that gift
of making everyone

Casey is a one in a million.

Man, I could see what
a good firefighter you are,

Wanted to make sure I saw you
before I got outta here.

Thanks for the opportunity.
It was an amazing shift.

Mason,
you are the missing piece.

What's been missing at 51

And I mean, no one will ever

38:57.030 --> 39:00.512
be able to replace him,
but it wasn't just his talent

39:00.555 --> 39:05.255
and his skills that made him
so important to 51.

39:05.299 --> 39:10.217
It was his generosity.
His kindness.

His heart.

at PD a while.

It didn't take long

his son, on the way out.
