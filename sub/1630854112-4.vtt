00:03.896 --> 00:05.653
<i> BENNY:</i>
<i> Southern California,</i>

00:05.673 --> 00:08.674
<i>home to some of North America's</i>
<i> most beautiful landscapes</i>

00:08.825 --> 00:11.659
<i> and an astounding</i>
<i> variety of wildlife.</i>

00:11.754 --> 00:14.238
Witness the Homo sapien.

00:14.331 --> 00:17.516
The most intelligent
of the order of primates.

00:17.667 --> 00:19.076
A fascinating species.

00:19.169 --> 00:21.336
With a highly
sophisticated intelligence

00:21.413 --> 00:24.581
and endless curiosity
about the natural world.

00:24.641 --> 00:26.692
Ah...

00:27.528 --> 00:31.772
The female Southern
California Ornithologist.

00:31.924 --> 00:33.607
Beautiful. Majestic.

00:33.701 --> 00:35.092
Just the kind of

00:35.185 --> 00:37.036
bird watcher you could
bring home to meet your parents.

00:37.263 --> 00:39.780
Clearly being pursued

00:39.932 --> 00:42.041
by a lesser, hopeful mate.

00:42.209 --> 00:45.936
(on phone):
♪<i> I feel sexilicious, sexi.</i> ♪

00:45.954 --> 00:47.621
What's up?

00:47.715 --> 00:49.606
Just start without me.

00:49.625 --> 00:51.291
Knowing Carol, it's probably
a carrot cake anyway.

00:51.443 --> 00:53.260
GILBERT:
Hey, check this out.

00:55.056 --> 00:57.281
Tons of Lumbricus terrestris
under here.

00:57.415 --> 00:58.891
-Ooh.
<i> -BENNY: Hey, I got to go.</i>

00:59.118 --> 01:02.519
Because I'm busy, okay?
I... I got to go. Bye.

01:03.289 --> 01:05.731
Where were we, my love?

01:09.904 --> 01:11.645
Oh, no.

01:11.739 --> 01:14.198
What the hell are they doing?

01:15.259 --> 01:17.134
Hey!

01:17.152 --> 01:19.803
That's not a safe place to be.

01:19.896 --> 01:22.472
Hey, hey!

01:22.491 --> 01:25.400
-What?
-You got to get out of there!

01:25.419 --> 01:28.587
That's not a safe place to be!

01:30.165 --> 01:32.508
-Aah!
-Aah!

01:42.419 --> 01:44.919
Dispatch said a tree
fell on a victim?

01:44.939 --> 01:46.921
Yeah, but probably not
how you're imagining.

01:47.015 --> 01:48.515
He was standing underneath
the root ball

01:48.667 --> 01:51.335
of a fallen tree when it snapped
back up on top of him.

01:51.428 --> 01:52.444
That's a thing that happens?

01:52.596 --> 01:54.171
BENNY:
Well, sometimes after storms

01:54.264 --> 01:56.173
or if other debris pinning
the downed tree falls away,

01:56.191 --> 01:57.507
the tension from the root system

01:57.601 --> 01:59.767
still underground
can pull it back up.

01:59.862 --> 02:04.014
-Like a mighty oak slingshot.
-Yeah, one that weighs
several tons.

02:04.032 --> 02:05.515
(muffled moaning)

02:05.534 --> 02:07.793
Hurry! I can hear him
moaning under there!

02:07.944 --> 02:09.294
Okay, all right.
That's good.

02:09.446 --> 02:11.371
That means he's still alive.
Let me have you clear out.

02:11.523 --> 02:12.798
Make some room
for my team to work.

02:12.967 --> 02:14.708
All right.

02:14.860 --> 02:16.135
Eddie, Chimney,

02:16.362 --> 02:17.970
start digging
access holes on the side.

02:18.197 --> 02:19.304
BOTH:
Copy that.

02:20.048 --> 02:23.458
All right.
Dispatch, this is Captain 118.

02:23.477 --> 02:25.293
We've got a victim
with multiple crush wounds.

02:25.387 --> 02:27.053
We're gonna need
a air ambulance

02:27.206 --> 02:29.039
at the nearest clearing
to our GPS coordinates.

02:29.041 --> 02:30.798
<i> DISPATCHER:</i>
<i> Copy that, Captain 118.</i>

02:30.818 --> 02:33.318
HEN:
I need a chain saw to separate
the tree from these roots.

02:33.470 --> 02:37.714
<i> DISPATCHER:</i>
<i> 118, Medevac Three is eight</i>
<i>minutes out from your location.</i>

02:37.733 --> 02:40.117
Buck, on me.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.494
I need a anchor point

02:42.646 --> 02:45.813
and a hinge so we can
expose that root ball.

02:45.833 --> 02:47.499
BUCK:
Anchor point secure.

02:47.726 --> 02:48.816
EDDIE:
I see the head.

02:48.836 --> 02:51.712
(grunts)
And I got a foot.

02:52.989 --> 02:55.340
-Okay, pulleys are secure.
-Okay.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.492
Shouldn't take much
to pull it down now.

02:58.253 --> 03:01.087
I got a pedal pulse.
It's weak, but it's there.

03:01.240 --> 03:02.163
EDDIE:
Airway is patent.

03:02.183 --> 03:03.182
Breath is severely diminished

03:03.333 --> 03:04.457
by the pressure of the tree.

03:04.593 --> 03:05.833
All right, Chim,
run a peripheral line

03:05.928 --> 03:07.352
of saline through his ankle.

03:07.579 --> 03:09.021
His body's gonna
want to decompensate

03:09.172 --> 03:10.522
when we remove the pressure
from the tree.

03:10.749 --> 03:12.265
-All right.
-EDDIE: Let me have
that turnout.

03:12.434 --> 03:14.610
I'll use it to protect
his airway.

03:16.922 --> 03:18.846
Here's the chain saw, Cap.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.440
CHIMNEY:
I'm in, Cap.

03:20.534 --> 03:22.609
All right, everyone
in position to pull.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.428
Give me those jumbos.

03:24.446 --> 03:27.447
HEN:
Once I cut the roots on this
side, we can tip the tree over.

03:27.599 --> 03:29.666
All right.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.116
All right, on my mark.

03:46.134 --> 03:48.618
One, two...

03:48.712 --> 03:49.728
Three!

03:50.564 --> 03:52.046
(grunting)

03:52.066 --> 03:53.398
BUCK:
Come on!

03:53.567 --> 03:54.399
(grunting)

03:54.568 --> 03:56.068
EDDIE:
Almost there.

03:59.481 --> 04:00.989
Buck, clear out!

04:05.579 --> 04:07.037
Timber.

04:11.735 --> 04:13.067
EDDIE:
He's not breathing.

04:13.087 --> 04:14.920
CHIMNEY:
Pulse is bottoming out.
Looks like

04:15.071 --> 04:17.464
massive internal bleeding.
Let's get him on a board.

04:19.167 --> 04:21.301
On three.
One, two, three.

04:23.580 --> 04:24.746
Starting compressions.

04:24.765 --> 04:27.266
Eddie, get him on a Lifepak.
Bag him.

04:33.181 --> 04:34.848
Please, you've
got to save my brother.

04:34.942 --> 04:37.334
-Your brother?
-Yeah, he and I have been

04:37.352 --> 04:39.503
bird watching
since we were kids.

04:39.596 --> 04:41.338
EDDIE:
All right, preparing to shock.

04:41.356 --> 04:42.698
Clear.

04:46.936 --> 04:48.512
No conversion.
I'm going again.

04:48.530 --> 04:49.997
Clear.

04:54.295 --> 04:56.520
Normal rhythm.
We got a pulse.

04:56.522 --> 04:57.963
Oh, thank God.

04:58.114 --> 05:00.632
Keep bagging him
while we prepare for transport.

05:02.361 --> 05:04.303
CHIMNEY:
On three. One, two, three.

05:04.454 --> 05:05.545
Up.

05:05.697 --> 05:07.547
Uh, if there's not
enough room for you

05:07.641 --> 05:09.883
to fly in the helicopter
with him, I'd be happy

05:10.035 --> 05:12.202
to drive you
to the hospital to meet him.

05:12.220 --> 05:14.037
Pretty sure there's
enough room on the helo

05:14.056 --> 05:15.647
for you to ride
with your brother.

05:15.799 --> 05:17.149
BENNY:
Uh, well, then...

05:17.376 --> 05:19.318
maybe you want
to take my number?

05:19.469 --> 05:21.135
Uh, it can be dangerous
out here alone

05:21.229 --> 05:24.114
for a female Southern California
ornithologist.

05:25.734 --> 05:27.642
Are you seriously asking me out

05:27.703 --> 05:30.120
after my brother almost died?

05:33.834 --> 05:35.167
BENNY:
I thought when she said

05:35.318 --> 05:37.502
it was her brother
that maybe that was my shot.

05:37.654 --> 05:38.837
Well... (grunts softly)

05:39.064 --> 05:41.006
I think maybe you have
bad instincts.

05:41.233 --> 05:42.758
Better luck next time.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.240
<i> MADDIE: So, you just</i>
<i> say yes to everything?</i>

05:50.333 --> 05:51.516
<i> BUCK: Yeah, he calls it</i>

05:51.668 --> 05:54.168
radical acceptance.

05:54.188 --> 05:55.412
What does that mean?

05:55.430 --> 05:56.855
Yeah, well,
so his theory is that

05:57.082 --> 05:59.416
we've all become too comfortable
in our lives, right? We...

05:59.434 --> 06:01.251
we go to the same jobs
every day.

06:01.344 --> 06:03.603
We hang out with the same
groups of people.

06:03.755 --> 06:05.772
We eat at the same restaurants,
we shop at the same stores.

06:05.924 --> 06:08.258
We don't do anything
that makes us feel uncomfortable

06:08.351 --> 06:10.093
or-or that just scares us.

06:10.112 --> 06:12.262
What about running
into burning buildings?

06:12.355 --> 06:14.206
No, it doesn't count.
That's just work, you know?

06:14.357 --> 06:17.709
Uh, before I came to L.A.,
I had all these adventures.

06:17.878 --> 06:20.212
You know? I-I went new places,

06:20.439 --> 06:22.881
I tried new things,
I met new people.

06:23.032 --> 06:25.217
That's 'cause you were
searching for something.

06:25.368 --> 06:26.943
What are you looking for now?

06:27.036 --> 06:28.795
That's what I'm gonna find out.

06:28.889 --> 06:31.598
By opening myself up
to possibility.

06:32.300 --> 06:34.542
Okay. What about this?

06:34.561 --> 06:37.044
You quit your job,
become my nanny

06:37.139 --> 06:38.713
and then I can stop
looking at these résumés.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.214
That-that's gonna be a hard no.

06:40.308 --> 06:41.883
No.<i> The Age of Absolutely</i>

06:41.977 --> 06:43.735
isn't about
dramatic life changes,

06:43.962 --> 06:45.311
and becoming your new nanny

06:45.406 --> 06:47.406
-would feel like
a dramatic life change.
-Well, so does

06:47.482 --> 06:49.074
hiring one.
They're all either 12

06:49.225 --> 06:51.301
or a potential serial killer.

06:51.319 --> 06:53.561
Come on, don't limit them--
they could be both.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.138
Uh, listen, I-I got to go.

06:55.231 --> 06:57.474
Uh, I'm meeting my old roommate
Connor and his new wife

06:57.567 --> 06:59.309
-for dinner tonight.
-Whoa, frat boy Connor?

06:59.327 --> 07:01.402
-That guy got married?
-Yeah, like, two years ago.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.088
Uh, we-we
kind of lost touch, but...

07:03.239 --> 07:05.590
reached out recently,
invited me to dinner,

07:05.759 --> 07:06.942
and I said...

07:06.944 --> 07:08.075
Absolutely?

07:08.153 --> 07:09.243
There you go.

07:09.337 --> 07:11.245
(chuckles)

07:11.339 --> 07:13.173
Good luck.

07:13.267 --> 07:14.658
<i> CHRISTOPHER: This...</i>

07:14.751 --> 07:16.601
is the wrong kind of mayo.

07:16.828 --> 07:18.161
It was on sale.

07:18.180 --> 07:20.588
You know, Dad, sometimes
you get what you pay for.

07:20.666 --> 07:22.941
Great. I'm raising
a condiment snob.

07:23.092 --> 07:25.277
(groans)

07:26.338 --> 07:28.171
And an impulse shopper.

07:28.190 --> 07:29.506
What is this?

07:29.524 --> 07:30.449
Cereal.

07:30.642 --> 07:33.267
Not sure a nutritionist
would agree.

07:33.287 --> 07:35.011
I got us the healthy one, too.

07:35.104 --> 07:36.455
Balanced.

07:36.682 --> 07:37.939
(chuckles softly)

07:38.033 --> 07:40.041
Lucky you're cute.

07:41.520 --> 07:43.462
(phone vibrates)

07:43.689 --> 07:44.871
Oh, it's your school.

07:45.023 --> 07:47.524
Wait, Dad, we didn't
finish the groceries.

07:47.617 --> 07:48.967
Hello?

07:49.044 --> 07:52.095
Yes, this is Mr. Diaz.

07:53.381 --> 07:54.547
Really?

07:54.700 --> 07:57.184
I had no idea.

08:00.706 --> 08:04.065
And how long has Christopher
been skipping Science Club?

08:05.377 --> 08:06.467
<i> HEN: I called maintenance.</i>

08:06.545 --> 08:08.545
They're gonna
try to come by tomorrow.

08:08.638 --> 08:09.546
Great.

08:09.639 --> 08:12.306
Okay. Have a good shift.

08:12.326 --> 08:13.216
Thanks.

08:13.235 --> 08:14.884
BOBBY: You got a minute, Cap?

08:14.978 --> 08:17.662
(sighs) Don't call me that.

08:18.499 --> 08:21.166
Come on, just this once?
(chuckles)

08:21.317 --> 08:22.742
No.

08:22.894 --> 08:24.652
Since you're here,
that must mean

08:24.746 --> 08:26.838
-that Samuel's doing better?
-Yes, he is.

08:26.990 --> 08:28.581
He's finally getting
settled back at home

08:28.675 --> 08:30.416
and Athena's finding
somebody to come by,

08:30.511 --> 08:32.569
take care of her parents
after she leaves.

08:32.738 --> 08:33.753
When's that gonna be?

08:33.905 --> 08:35.680
Probably end of next week.

08:36.666 --> 08:38.016
How are you doing?

08:38.593 --> 08:39.684
Good.

08:39.928 --> 08:42.245
I uploaded everything
to FireStat this morning,

08:42.264 --> 08:45.081
-the duty rosters are...
-I Wasn't asking about work.

08:45.100 --> 08:47.150
I already know
you did a great job.

08:48.845 --> 08:50.845
Who called you? Chim?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.531
Karen.

08:54.350 --> 08:56.350
(exhales)
How much did she yell?

08:56.370 --> 08:58.945
No, she kept a perfectly
respectable tone

08:59.097 --> 09:01.206
the entire time
she called me an idiot.

09:02.117 --> 09:03.208
I am sorry, Hen.

09:03.359 --> 09:04.951
I shouldn't have
put this on you.

09:05.045 --> 09:06.770
I volunteered.

09:06.863 --> 09:10.048
It's not your fault
I flunked out of medical school.

09:10.275 --> 09:12.108
Well, maybe I can call them,
tell them what happened,

09:12.127 --> 09:14.678
and you could retake the test.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.705
Thanks, Bobby.

09:17.799 --> 09:19.282
I appreciate the gesture,

09:19.301 --> 09:22.227
but I don't think there's
anything either of us can do.

09:24.398 --> 09:27.715
Okay, well, maybe I can't fix
the things at medical school,

09:27.809 --> 09:30.551
but I can do something--
give you a little time off.

09:30.571 --> 09:33.387
You've been pushing
too hard for too long,

09:33.448 --> 09:35.240
you're exhausted
and you need a break.

09:35.467 --> 09:40.394
So take as many days or weeks
as you need to get recharged.

09:40.414 --> 09:43.248
-(exhales)
-That's an order.

09:44.492 --> 09:45.584
Time off?

09:45.735 --> 09:48.069
Not sure I even know
what to do with that.

09:48.088 --> 09:49.421
Try doing nothing.

09:49.648 --> 09:52.424
And if anyone asks you
to do anything,

09:52.651 --> 09:54.718
just say no.

09:58.932 --> 10:01.341
(chuckling):
So... is that when you

10:01.435 --> 10:03.268
-moved into the frat house?
-Hold on.

10:03.495 --> 10:06.104
It wasn't a total frat house.
Okay? We had real jobs.

10:06.331 --> 10:08.164
Five guys under one roof?

10:08.183 --> 10:09.423
That's a frat house.

10:09.443 --> 10:11.835
We weren't that bad.
Or... were we?

10:11.928 --> 10:13.169
There-there was
this one time when...

10:13.188 --> 10:15.004
Well, maybe, maybe,
maybe, maybe, maybe.

10:15.023 --> 10:16.615
We were smart enough not to
bring women back to that place.

10:16.766 --> 10:19.600
It wasn't really conducive
to romantic evenings.

10:19.694 --> 10:21.027
Oh. Well, good.

10:21.179 --> 10:22.512
'Cause, before me,
I'd like to think there were

10:22.605 --> 10:25.348
-no romantic evenings.
-Really? Uh-huh, uh-huh.

10:25.441 --> 10:27.274
Uh, listen, I don't-I don't
even know--

10:27.294 --> 10:29.127
how-how did you guys meet?

10:29.796 --> 10:31.037
The old-fashioned way.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.279
At a bar.

10:32.299 --> 10:33.465
He was picking up takeout

10:33.616 --> 10:35.967
and I was sitting
at the bar eating, alone.

10:36.194 --> 10:38.803
Not just eating alone
but reading a book.

10:39.030 --> 10:41.197
I was intrigued,
so I sat next to her

10:41.366 --> 10:42.641
and ate my takeout right there.

10:42.792 --> 10:45.201
And I thought he was
some sort of weird stalker.

10:45.220 --> 10:46.703
'Cause, I mean, who talks
to strangers anymore?

10:46.796 --> 10:48.388
-Right, right. (chuckles)
-And who reads actual books?

10:48.464 --> 10:51.650
Anyway, I charmed her
with my corny jokes,

10:51.877 --> 10:52.876
-He did.
-and...

10:52.894 --> 10:54.394
-that was it.
-That was it.

10:54.546 --> 10:56.655
Wow, and-and your
frat house days

10:56.806 --> 10:59.473
-are finally behind you.
-Yeah.

10:59.600 --> 11:02.327
-We actually
bought a house last year.
-We did.

11:02.478 --> 11:04.387
You guys are really
doing it all, huh?

11:04.480 --> 11:06.665
Marriage, house,
and... and kids?

11:08.317 --> 11:09.392
Kind of.

11:09.485 --> 11:12.395
We've sort of hit a snag
on that last part.

11:13.156 --> 11:15.840
It's crazy.
When I was single, all I did

11:15.992 --> 11:18.902
was pray not to be pregnant,
and now...

11:18.995 --> 11:21.513
Nothing seems
to get the job done.

11:22.407 --> 11:23.831
Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.

11:24.000 --> 11:26.685
You know, I-I think more people
struggle with fertility issues

11:26.912 --> 11:27.927
than-than we realize.

11:28.079 --> 11:29.521
But there's lots
options now, right?

11:29.748 --> 11:32.765
There's-there's drugs,
IVF, even surrogacy.

11:32.918 --> 11:35.360
Kameron's not the problem.

11:37.364 --> 11:38.613
I am.

11:39.700 --> 11:41.424
Not enough swimmers.

11:41.426 --> 11:43.109
Uh, um...

11:43.261 --> 11:45.186
Huh, I'm-I'm sorry to hear that.

11:45.205 --> 11:48.022
Uh, th... um,
that must be tough.

11:48.099 --> 11:49.949
You have no idea.

11:50.101 --> 11:52.118
-But we're looking
at other options.
-Mm-hmm.

11:52.270 --> 11:55.605
-Uh, specifically,
sperm donor options.
-Nice.

11:55.623 --> 11:59.375
Which is why we actually
invited you to dinner.

12:00.278 --> 12:02.111
(chuckles)
We wanted to know

12:02.205 --> 12:05.640
if you'd consider
being our sperm donor.

12:16.903 --> 12:19.887
He's been lying
right to my face.

12:19.906 --> 12:22.407
Has he never lied to you before?

12:22.634 --> 12:24.075
I mean, little things.

12:24.152 --> 12:26.636
Like, did he brush his teeth
before he went to bed or

12:26.729 --> 12:30.415
did he put the empty milk
carton back into the fridge.

12:30.566 --> 12:31.808
But not like this.

12:31.901 --> 12:33.585
Well, in his defense,
Science Club

12:33.736 --> 12:35.086
does sound kind of boring.

12:35.238 --> 12:36.646
Joining was his idea.

12:36.664 --> 12:39.573
Probably knew it would make
a great cover. Smart kid.

12:39.667 --> 12:42.151
HEN:
So, wait, if he wasn't
going to Science Club,

12:42.170 --> 12:43.319
then where was he?

12:43.412 --> 12:45.930
At the park with his friends,
apparently.

12:46.082 --> 12:47.490
Which I really
don't understand, because

12:47.509 --> 12:50.059
he knows that I'd take him there
anytime he wants.

12:51.772 --> 12:53.329
Maybe that's the problem.

12:53.331 --> 12:55.422
No offense, but Christopher
might be getting to that age

12:55.517 --> 12:57.333
where he doesn't want
Dad around all the time.

12:57.426 --> 13:00.670
Yeah, kids do grow
to crave privacy.

13:00.688 --> 13:02.113
Half the thrill sometimes

13:02.340 --> 13:04.690
is doing something and thinking
you're getting away with it.

13:04.843 --> 13:07.268
He should've told me that
before he got caught lying,

13:07.287 --> 13:09.178
got grounded for one week.

13:09.272 --> 13:11.105
No video games, no exemptions.

13:11.124 --> 13:13.625
Tough but fair.

13:16.688 --> 13:18.779
Notice you're being
awfully quiet over there, Buck.

13:18.873 --> 13:21.691
Christopher hasn't said anything
to you about these little

13:21.784 --> 13:22.875
secrets, has he?

13:23.028 --> 13:26.287
Uh, to me?
No, no-no secrets here.

13:27.198 --> 13:28.381
Buck probably can't relate
because he always

13:28.533 --> 13:31.551
tells us the truth
about his life, often in

13:31.645 --> 13:34.053
-excruciatingly specific detail.
-Mm.

13:35.056 --> 13:37.040
Hen, you're supposed
to be on leave.

13:37.058 --> 13:38.132
What are you doing here?

13:38.151 --> 13:41.635
I, uh... uh, swung by

13:41.655 --> 13:45.548
to, uh, pick up some kombucha

13:45.641 --> 13:47.567
that I left in the fridge.

13:47.661 --> 13:49.476
Really?
Where is it?

13:49.496 --> 13:51.812
I couldn't find it.

13:51.832 --> 13:52.813
Hmm.

13:52.833 --> 13:55.316
I guess somebody drank it.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.502
Hmm.

13:58.730 --> 14:00.229
My house is too damn quiet, Cap.

14:00.323 --> 14:02.582
Karen's off at work,
Denny's with his friends.

14:02.734 --> 14:04.008
I have no tests to study for

14:04.160 --> 14:05.418
and the silence
is kind of deafening.

14:05.570 --> 14:07.570
I-I-I just needed
to come somewhere

14:07.663 --> 14:09.347
-with a little bit more noise.
-(alarm ringing)

14:09.574 --> 14:11.349
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

14:12.501 --> 14:14.243
BOBBY:
Hen, I say this with love.

14:14.337 --> 14:16.729
Don't be here when we get back.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.191
(engine starts)

14:32.855 --> 14:34.688

14:34.766 --> 14:38.167
Dispatch, 118 is on the scene,
Eighth and Alameda.

14:41.697 --> 14:43.548
Five cars and one bike.

14:43.699 --> 14:46.367
-All right.
How you feeling sir?
-(groaning)

14:46.461 --> 14:48.794
I'm just...
happy I wore a helmet.

14:48.889 --> 14:50.722
Feels like you have
a broken fibula.

14:50.949 --> 14:52.206
SCOTTY:
Yeah. (grunting)

14:52.225 --> 14:54.041
My left leg took the brunt
of the hit, but...

14:54.060 --> 14:55.618
I was able to ride
out of it, so...

14:55.787 --> 14:57.803
-(exhaling sharply)
-Must be a some kind of bike.

14:57.898 --> 14:59.213
-What happened?
-I was just

14:59.232 --> 15:00.714
cruising on my steel frame,

15:00.734 --> 15:03.626
and that idiot over there
swerved into the bike lane.

15:03.645 --> 15:07.054
He hit me and then veered
into that oncoming car.

15:07.132 --> 15:10.158
He was driving
like a crazy person!

15:11.394 --> 15:12.468
Or a drunk one.

15:12.487 --> 15:14.637
Smells like
a distillery in here.

15:14.656 --> 15:15.896
Chim, you need a coroner?

15:15.974 --> 15:17.582
Nope, he's still alive.
Pulse is strong

15:17.767 --> 15:19.233

15:19.327 --> 15:21.994

15:22.088 --> 15:23.630

15:27.986 --> 15:29.576

Can you hear me?

15:29.654 --> 15:31.512
Sir, can you hear me?

15:33.266 --> 15:34.707
No response to sternal rub.

15:34.859 --> 15:36.008
I'm gonna take his vitals.

15:36.102 --> 15:40.063
We need to cut him out
and transport him, ASAP.

15:54.770 --> 15:55.769
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

15:55.863 --> 15:57.622

19:30.395 --> 19:32.653
<i> -(chuckling)</i>
-I finally got
Christopher to actually

19:32.747 --> 19:34.230
go to his Science Club
meeting today,

19:34.323 --> 19:37.233
but 20 minutes in, I get a call
from his teacher saying

19:37.251 --> 19:38.342
he's refusing to participate.

19:38.569 --> 19:40.569
She said it was
an extracurricular club,

19:40.663 --> 19:42.496
so if he doesn't want
to be there, I should just

19:42.590 --> 19:45.349
-take him home.
<i> -That doesn't sound</i>
<i> like Christopher.</i>

19:45.501 --> 19:46.500
Yeah.

19:46.594 --> 19:50.170
I tried to talk about it
with him and...

19:50.190 --> 19:52.932
-he ignored me
the whole drive back.
<i> -That part--</i>

19:53.084 --> 19:54.174
<i> that part sounds like us.</i>

19:54.194 --> 19:56.176
<i> The old Diaz family</i>
<i> cold shoulder.</i>

19:56.270 --> 19:57.844
<i> Your Abuela originated it,</i>

19:57.864 --> 20:00.013
<i> but as I recall,</i>
<i> you perfected it.</i>

20:00.033 --> 20:02.015
Ha, ha, very funny.

20:02.035 --> 20:04.109
<i> -(chuckles)</i>
-Everyone keeps on telling me

20:04.262 --> 20:06.186
this is normal and that
I should give him

20:06.280 --> 20:07.446
some room to grow, but...

20:07.523 --> 20:09.207
I can't help it
if it's my instinct

20:09.358 --> 20:10.449
to always want to protect him.

20:10.543 --> 20:12.877
You know, the world is tough.
And he's not.

20:13.104 --> 20:16.105
<i> Maybe you're</i>
<i> overcorrecting because...</i>

20:16.198 --> 20:18.716
<i> because I didn't</i>
<i> protect you enough.</i>

20:19.868 --> 20:22.202
<i>You had to grow up a lot faster</i>
<i> than you should have.</i>

20:22.222 --> 20:24.722
<i> But that doesn't mean you can</i>
<i>keep Christopher a kid forever.</i>

20:24.873 --> 20:27.708
<i> You can't stop the biological</i>
<i> clock from ticking.</i>

20:27.727 --> 20:29.785

I can hit?

20:29.804 --> 20:32.137
<i> (chuckles, sniffles)</i>

20:32.290 --> 20:33.731
<i> You know, children,</i>

20:33.808 --> 20:36.400
<i> they don't just pick up</i>
<i> on the things we say and do.</i>

20:36.552 --> 20:38.310
<i> They also pick up</i>
<i> on the things we don't.</i>

20:38.479 --> 20:40.796
<i> If you don't give Christopher</i>
<i> some independence,</i>

20:40.798 --> 20:42.298
<i> let him know you trust him,</i>

20:42.391 --> 20:44.617

<i> to trust himself?</i>

20:47.563 --> 20:49.080
<i> (knocking)</i>

20:54.662 --> 20:56.629
Connor. Uh...

20:57.665 --> 20:59.239
-Hey.
-Hey, man.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.317
Do you have a minute?

21:01.335 --> 21:03.076
Look, I just wanted to come by

21:03.096 --> 21:05.746
and apologize
for the other night.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.006
We pretty much blindsided you,

21:07.082 --> 21:09.341
and I really feel terrible
about that.

21:09.435 --> 21:13.104
Uh, yeah, you did
catch me off guard.

21:14.348 --> 21:15.498
I know.

21:15.591 --> 21:16.849
I haven't seen you
in three years

21:16.925 --> 21:18.167
and the first time we reconnect,

21:18.185 --> 21:19.610
I asked for body fluids.

21:19.762 --> 21:20.853
(chuckles softly)

21:21.005 --> 21:22.671
That wasn't the right way
to ask you.

21:22.690 --> 21:25.766
Is there is a... a right way
to ask that question?

21:25.860 --> 21:28.101
(clicks tongue)
Probably not.

21:28.195 --> 21:30.362
-Mm.
-(laughs)

21:30.439 --> 21:32.498
Come on. Take a seat.
(exhales)

21:35.277 --> 21:38.212
Uh, so, hey, are you-are you
doing okay?

21:38.947 --> 21:40.631
(Connor clears throat)

21:43.285 --> 21:44.785
Do you know what it feels like

21:44.879 --> 21:47.880
to feel like
a total failure as a man,

21:47.974 --> 21:50.090
and like you're letting down
the woman you love?

21:51.385 --> 21:56.564
Uh, probably not in the same way
you feel right now.

21:58.392 --> 21:59.725
I assumed it was her.

21:59.877 --> 22:02.878
You know, we were trying
for months, changing her diet,

22:02.897 --> 22:06.198
ovulation thermometers,
the whole bit.

22:07.735 --> 22:10.828
Never occurred to me that
I couldn't do this for her.

22:10.997 --> 22:13.039
For us.

22:18.320 --> 22:21.172
Yeah, I-I got to ask you.

22:21.399 --> 22:23.082
Why me?

22:23.234 --> 22:24.750
I mean, you could go to

22:24.902 --> 22:26.159
a sperm bank,
you could-you could pick

22:26.253 --> 22:27.920
someone with perfect genes.

22:28.014 --> 22:28.754
Yeah.

22:28.848 --> 22:30.072
We could flip through a book

22:30.165 --> 22:32.165
and know stuff
like their eye color,

22:32.185 --> 22:34.018
whether they're gonna
be a scientist or an artist

22:34.169 --> 22:35.578
or what their body type is.

22:35.596 --> 22:38.080
But we couldn't know
if they'd be a good person.

22:38.099 --> 22:39.690
How they treat
the people they care about.

22:39.767 --> 22:41.842
I know those things about you.

22:41.861 --> 22:45.588
That's way more important
than the superficial stuff.

22:45.681 --> 22:47.439
I...

22:47.592 --> 22:49.015
(chuckles softly)

22:49.035 --> 22:51.535
I swear, this isn't me
trying to convince you.

22:51.762 --> 22:54.763
No, it's, uh...

22:54.782 --> 22:56.573
it's nice to hear.

22:56.726 --> 22:58.042
Thank you for saying that.

22:58.936 --> 23:01.420
Thank you for hearing me out.

23:02.289 --> 23:04.790
I know this is asking too much.

23:04.884 --> 23:07.276
I'm letting you
off the hook here.

23:07.294 --> 23:10.596
You do not need to do this.

23:14.468 --> 23:18.303
<i> CLARIBELLE:</i>

-Uh...
-The brave woodsman.

The brave woodsman

ran to the woods.

Then, the SeeWahPah

23:38.325 --> 23:40.901
runs through the woods
on its backward feet,

23:40.995 --> 23:44.088

Oh, thank God.

29:09.473 --> 29:12.491
Sorry, I-I know you're-you're
supposed to be relaxing. I...

29:12.659 --> 29:13.917
No, no, no, no.

29:14.144 --> 29:15.252
I have never been happier
to see someone

29:15.403 --> 29:17.813
show up unannounced
at my house, ever. Please.

29:17.815 --> 29:20.999
Uh, guessing the relaxing
is-is not going so well.

29:21.151 --> 29:23.001
(scoffs)

29:23.170 --> 29:25.670
Doing nothing
is giving me more anxiety

29:25.823 --> 29:26.746
than trying to do everything.

29:26.766 --> 29:28.991
I'm not wired for this.

29:29.084 --> 29:30.750
What's happening?

29:31.586 --> 29:34.563
What do you know
about sperm donors?

29:36.683 --> 29:38.333
HEN:
And you didn't say no?

29:38.335 --> 29:40.944
Mm. I didn't feel like I could.

29:41.096 --> 29:43.947
Right.
Your "age of absolutely" thing.

29:44.099 --> 29:46.374
No, no, no.
Not even just 'cause of that.

29:47.194 --> 29:51.663
I didn't want to turn them down.
I felt bad for them.

29:52.850 --> 29:55.183
Which is very kind of you.

29:55.277 --> 29:58.703
I mean, me and Karen
have been where they are.

29:58.856 --> 30:00.539
When you're trying

30:00.615 --> 30:03.542
and you want it,
and it's just not happening,

30:03.694 --> 30:05.636
it's devastating.

30:08.623 --> 30:11.624
If you said yes,
you'd be changing their lives.

30:11.644 --> 30:13.718
Right, which is-is, uh, a pro.

30:13.813 --> 30:15.554
You know, a-a big pro.

30:15.706 --> 30:19.207
If I can help
ease this burden for them,

30:19.301 --> 30:20.392
why would I not do that?

30:20.486 --> 30:22.986
'Cause you'd be also
changing your life.

30:23.213 --> 30:25.972
Yeah, come on, for, like...
a few minutes?

30:26.066 --> 30:27.549
Ew. Stop.

30:27.642 --> 30:28.992
(chuckling)

30:29.219 --> 30:32.979
But, seriously,
for the rest of your life.

30:32.998 --> 30:35.740
This isn't an anonymous
donation, Buck.

30:35.893 --> 30:36.908
You won't have to wonder

30:37.077 --> 30:39.895
whether there's a kid
out there with your DNA.

30:39.897 --> 30:41.839
You're gonna know there is.

30:41.990 --> 30:44.675
You'll probably
get Christmas cards.

30:45.586 --> 30:46.969
(exhales)

30:48.347 --> 30:50.830
The main thing
to ask yourself...

30:50.850 --> 30:53.666
is are you capable
of doing this?

30:53.760 --> 30:55.577
I think we both know I'm...

30:55.670 --> 30:56.854
I'm-I'm capable, uh,

30:57.081 --> 30:59.247
-that's why they asked me.
-Are you capable

30:59.266 --> 31:02.100
of being a father
and walking away?

31:02.194 --> 31:05.320
Because that's what
they're really asking you.

31:11.853 --> 31:13.929
Donor, not dad.

31:13.931 --> 31:15.873
Exactly.

31:16.066 --> 31:18.542
You'd be changing
their lives, but

31:18.619 --> 31:21.436
they're not necessarily
inviting you to stick around

31:21.455 --> 31:24.439
-and be a part of it.
-Right.

31:24.532 --> 31:25.457
Yeah.

31:26.326 --> 31:29.595
I guess-I guess I never really
thought about that part.

31:30.723 --> 31:32.639
You need to.

31:34.542 --> 31:36.101
Huh.

31:45.404 --> 31:47.237
Hey Maddie.
How's your day going?

31:47.464 --> 31:49.389
-Yesterday was a wild ride.
-Yeah.

31:49.483 --> 31:51.466
It was.
Thanks for your help with that.

31:51.559 --> 31:53.911
I can't believe you were able
to find that other call.

31:54.062 --> 31:55.654
-I heard mom's doing okay.
-Yeah.

31:55.730 --> 31:59.232
Some broken bones, lacerations.
She'll heal.

31:59.401 --> 32:00.659
Poor kid.

32:00.753 --> 32:03.328
Can't even imagine what
it must have been like for her.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.980
Not just yesterday,
but all those years

32:04.998 --> 32:06.815
seeing her dad
put hands on her mom.

32:06.833 --> 32:09.167
Yeah, I don't wish for anyone

32:09.319 --> 32:11.503
to go through what
that girl and her mom have.

32:11.655 --> 32:13.079
Me either.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.506
Don't get me wrong.

32:14.600 --> 32:15.915
My mom totally dated

32:16.009 --> 32:17.509
a bunch of losers
after my dad died.

32:17.661 --> 32:20.011
But none of them
ever hurt her in that way.

32:20.164 --> 32:23.348
And then she finally
found my stepdad, so...

32:23.442 --> 32:26.234
Happy ending.

32:43.278 --> 32:45.370
(indistinct chatter)

32:46.131 --> 32:50.175
Dispatch 118
is at the sorority house.

32:52.546 --> 32:54.212
This way!

32:54.364 --> 32:56.306
Okay, let's make some room.

32:56.383 --> 32:59.292
You have to help him, please.
Please help Hoover.

32:59.386 --> 33:00.793
-(whining)
-EDDIE: That's a...

33:00.887 --> 33:02.312
-Yep.
-You have to help him, please.

33:02.464 --> 33:05.631
Okay, I want everybody to take
a step back, including you.

33:05.800 --> 33:06.966
He's in our hands now.

33:07.060 --> 33:09.227
-What do we do, Cap?
-What we always do.

33:09.379 --> 33:11.713
Start assessing the patient.

33:11.806 --> 33:13.198
CHIMNEY:
Let me take a look.

33:14.493 --> 33:15.433
(Hoover whining)

33:15.494 --> 33:18.220
Got a pulse.
Thready, but it's there.

33:18.388 --> 33:19.312
EDDIE:
Respirations are shallow.

33:19.331 --> 33:21.389
I count six breaths a minute.

33:21.558 --> 33:23.225
CHIMNEY:
Got a lot of drool
around the mouth.

33:23.243 --> 33:26.244
Okay, hand me the Ambu bag. I'm
gonna support his respirations.

33:26.396 --> 33:29.581
Okay. Dispatch said this was
an OD. What did this dog

33:29.657 --> 33:30.841
-get into?
-Nope, sorry.
-I'm out.

33:31.010 --> 33:33.326
-What did he eat?
-He found it on the floor.

33:33.345 --> 33:36.254
He wasn't supposed to eat it.

33:36.331 --> 33:37.514
You didn't think
a dog named Hoover

33:37.741 --> 33:39.074
would eat anything
he could find?

33:39.092 --> 33:40.666
SHERYL: I don't know.
Did President Hoover

33:40.761 --> 33:41.760
eat random things?

33:41.854 --> 33:44.337
Hoover, like the vacuum.

33:44.414 --> 33:46.023
Oh.

33:46.174 --> 33:47.932
Oh. (cries)

33:48.027 --> 33:49.026
It's opioids.

33:49.135 --> 33:50.843
How much was in there?

33:50.863 --> 33:53.012
It wasn't mine. Someone must've
brought it with them.

33:53.148 --> 33:54.923
This isn't working.
I lost his pulse.

33:54.925 --> 33:56.182
It's an OD.
How about Narcan?

33:56.351 --> 33:58.017
Not a veterinarian.
I've never given Narcan

33:58.037 --> 34:00.019
-to an animal before.
-Hen would know.

34:00.113 --> 34:01.613
Thought we weren't
supposed to call her.

34:01.765 --> 34:04.023
It's an emergency, clearly.

34:04.043 --> 34:06.710
What? You're...
you're coding a what?

34:06.861 --> 34:08.436
N-No, no.
Hang on, hang on.

34:08.438 --> 34:12.198
I need someone else to confirm
this is actually happening.

34:12.292 --> 34:15.385
Tell Buck what you're coding.

34:15.612 --> 34:17.745
<i> Uh, it's a dog.</i>
<i> OD'd on opioids.</i>

34:17.747 --> 34:18.722
Are you two drunk?

34:18.891 --> 34:20.206
<i> BUCK:</i>
<i> Absolutely.</i>

34:20.284 --> 34:21.283
It's 2:00 in the afternoon.

34:21.301 --> 34:22.875
It's 5:00 somewhere.

34:22.895 --> 34:23.952
(Hen laughs)

34:23.970 --> 34:25.211
<i> HEN:</i>
<i> How much does it weigh?</i>

34:25.230 --> 34:28.047
-15 pounds, give or take.
<i> -Okay.</i>

34:28.125 --> 34:28.973
<i> Point oh four</i>

34:29.068 --> 34:30.642
kilograms per milligram.

34:30.794 --> 34:32.644
That's six point eight...

34:32.738 --> 34:34.104
<i> Two point seven</i>

34:34.256 --> 34:35.480
milligrams Narcan.

34:35.574 --> 34:37.056
-2.7.
-Thanks, Hen.

34:37.150 --> 34:38.650
Come on, buddy.

34:38.726 --> 34:41.161
<i> -EDDIE: All right.</i>
<i> -CHIMNEY: Ready?</i>

34:50.405 --> 34:52.297
Come on, buddy.

34:56.762 --> 34:58.929
-(barks)
-(students exclaim)

34:59.080 --> 35:00.839
-Hoover!
-GIRL: Oh, he's okay.

35:00.991 --> 35:03.416
BOBBY:
All right.

35:03.510 --> 35:05.084
Come here, little buddy.
Here we go.

35:05.104 --> 35:06.770
-Oh, wait.
-Let's go.

35:06.997 --> 35:08.330
Wait, where are you
taking Hoover?

35:08.498 --> 35:10.332
To a vet and then
into protective custody.

35:10.500 --> 35:13.318
-That's a thing?
-It is now.

35:15.930 --> 35:17.188
Mm.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.599
You did math in your head.

35:19.618 --> 35:22.935
-(chuckles) I know, right?
-(laughs)

35:23.029 --> 35:27.699
Take that, doctor professor lady
who flunked me.

35:27.775 --> 35:29.017
-She's an idiot.
-Mm-hmm.

35:29.110 --> 35:32.111
You know, so what--
you failed some stupid test,

35:32.131 --> 35:34.113
but your-your instincts...

35:34.133 --> 35:36.191
are incredible.

35:36.209 --> 35:39.094
You would have made
one heck of a doctor.

35:41.306 --> 35:43.306
Mm.

35:46.219 --> 35:47.627
<i> BOY:</i>
<i> Are you guys set</i>

35:47.721 --> 35:49.295
<i> for Logan's birthday party</i>
<i> next weekend?</i>

35:49.314 --> 35:52.298
<i> -You're going, right?</i>
-CHRISTOPHER: Yeah. Totally.

35:52.317 --> 35:55.710
-(blankets rustling)
-(Christopher continuing
indistinctly)

35:55.803 --> 35:56.878
Logan said
he would have anything,

35:56.897 --> 35:58.822
but his mom wouldn't let him.

35:59.049 --> 36:00.806
Then Logan said that
he was getting

36:00.901 --> 36:02.159
a batting cage for his birthday.

36:02.386 --> 36:04.327
It's gonna be so cool.

36:04.479 --> 36:05.887
Off. Now.

36:05.906 --> 36:07.539
I got to go.

36:08.892 --> 36:09.666
What do you think you're doing?

36:09.817 --> 36:11.743
What part of "no video games

36:11.895 --> 36:13.336
for a week"
don't you understand?

36:13.563 --> 36:16.231
It's not fair. You never
let me do anything on my own.

36:16.249 --> 36:19.734
I'm not a baby, and
you always treat me like one.

36:19.827 --> 36:22.253
I don't<i> think</i> you're a baby, but
you sure are acting like one.

36:22.406 --> 36:24.255
And you're acting like a jerk!

36:24.349 --> 36:27.976
Do not use that tone with me.

36:29.413 --> 36:31.605
I'm sorry.

36:35.343 --> 36:37.068
Okay.

36:42.534 --> 36:45.093
I don't want you
to feel like a baby.

36:45.262 --> 36:47.520
And I don't want you
to think I'm a jerk.

36:47.539 --> 36:49.873
But... okay.

36:50.100 --> 36:51.541
Maybe sometimes
I can't help myself.

36:51.768 --> 36:54.936
You know, my instinct
is to always protect you, Chris.

36:55.029 --> 36:58.289
I don't need you to protect me.

36:58.442 --> 37:00.926
Well, I'm not sure
I know how to stop.

37:01.795 --> 37:03.720
You're growing up on me, bud.

37:03.947 --> 37:05.797
But you still need
to respect me

37:05.949 --> 37:07.949
and to be honest with me.

37:08.042 --> 37:10.227
We need to look out
for each other.

37:10.454 --> 37:12.229
You... Talk to each other

37:12.456 --> 37:14.380
about what we're
going through, okay?

37:14.474 --> 37:16.307
-Okay.
-And I love you,

37:16.401 --> 37:18.735
but when you break the rules,

37:18.886 --> 37:20.645
there are gonna be consequences.

37:20.797 --> 37:24.574
And facing them
is what makes you a young man.

37:24.726 --> 37:26.818
And we've already
established, clearly,

37:26.970 --> 37:28.470
that's what you are, right?

37:28.563 --> 37:30.288
Right.

37:32.158 --> 37:35.234
So once your punishment's over,
we can...

37:35.254 --> 37:37.161
talk about you going to the park

37:37.314 --> 37:39.572
and hanging out with
your friends without me around.

37:39.591 --> 37:42.817
-Awesome. Thanks, Dad.
-Don't thank me just yet,

37:42.836 --> 37:45.411
'cause your punishment
just got extended by one week.

37:45.430 --> 37:46.596
Oh, come on.

37:46.782 --> 37:49.081
No.
Now get to bed.

37:49.101 --> 37:50.600
Night, Dad.

37:50.752 --> 37:53.061
Good night.

38:08.028 --> 38:10.537
(indistinct announcement
over P.A.)

38:12.291 --> 38:13.939
MADDIE:
May I come in?

38:14.034 --> 38:16.534
Hi, Claribelle.

38:16.611 --> 38:17.777
How do you...

38:17.796 --> 38:20.522
-I'm Maddie.
-Maddie?

38:20.615 --> 38:23.282
-Hi.
-You were the one
that sent the help?

38:23.302 --> 38:25.376
Yes.
Uh, and I brought someone

38:25.470 --> 38:27.362
that I think
could help some more.

38:27.455 --> 38:30.214
Hello, Lourdes.
My name is Yvette.

38:30.367 --> 38:31.957
I'm an immigration lawyer.
I work

38:31.977 --> 38:34.144
with victims
of domestic violence.

38:34.295 --> 38:35.961
I don't understand.

38:36.723 --> 38:39.057
Uh, Claribelle said
that you were undocumented.

38:39.209 --> 38:42.544
Stephen promised that
he will get me my green card,

38:42.562 --> 38:44.562
but he never did.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.565
He said that I could not
get one without him.

38:47.717 --> 38:48.825
He lied to you.

38:48.976 --> 38:50.568
Under the Violence
Against Women Act,

38:50.720 --> 38:52.053
you can self-petition.

38:52.072 --> 38:55.290
You do not need
to ask your abuser for anything.

38:56.576 --> 38:58.576
So, I'll get to stay here?

38:58.728 --> 38:59.819
I think we got a good shot.

38:59.913 --> 39:02.063
And if all goes well, yes,

39:02.082 --> 39:03.590
you'll get to stay here.

39:04.659 --> 39:06.843
LOURDES:
Why?

39:06.994 --> 39:10.096
Why would you do this for us?

39:11.758 --> 39:14.726
I've been where you are.

39:16.021 --> 39:17.354
Thank you.

39:17.581 --> 39:19.105
You're welcome.

39:22.118 --> 39:23.360
(sniffles)

39:28.425 --> 39:30.617
CLARIBELLE:
Maddie, wait!

39:31.595 --> 39:33.428
Thank you.

39:33.446 --> 39:36.247
(chuckles)

39:37.876 --> 39:40.935
You are a very strong
and smart girl.

39:41.028 --> 39:42.620
You took good care of your mom.

39:42.772 --> 39:44.122
Be proud of yourself.

39:44.198 --> 39:45.548
I just did what she told me.

39:45.717 --> 39:47.366
She taught me how to run.

39:47.386 --> 39:48.793
No.

39:48.887 --> 39:51.096
She taught you how to fight.

39:51.965 --> 39:53.723
(chuckles softly)

39:54.542 --> 39:56.393
<i> DR. SIMMONS:</i>
<i> I think we should move</i>

39:56.544 --> 39:59.621
these two bullet points
to a new slide.

39:59.639 --> 40:01.064
No one's gonna
be able to read that.

40:02.234 --> 40:06.144
-Ms. Wilson.
-I-I... I'm-I'm sorry
to barge in.

40:06.296 --> 40:09.147
Your office said
you were in here.

40:09.299 --> 40:11.966
Um, do you have a minute?

40:12.727 --> 40:14.244
Why don't you get started
on those changes.

40:14.320 --> 40:16.137
We'll go through the rest later.

40:16.230 --> 40:18.164
-Okay.
-Come on in.

40:21.402 --> 40:22.585
(door closes)

40:28.593 --> 40:30.001
How can I help you?

40:30.095 --> 40:32.554
Give me a second chance.

40:33.323 --> 40:35.006
I-I have good instincts.

40:35.100 --> 40:38.101
A-And a lot of paramedic
experience in the field.

40:38.328 --> 40:42.513
I-I care. I care about patients
and saving lives.

40:42.607 --> 40:44.423
I-I know that I completely

40:44.517 --> 40:46.759
bombed on my final.

40:47.595 --> 40:50.613
But I also know that
I could be a really good doctor.

40:50.782 --> 40:54.767
How badly do you want
to be a really good doctor?

40:55.528 --> 40:58.288
Enough that I will put myself
and my family

40:58.439 --> 41:00.790
through another 12 months
of hell

41:00.959 --> 41:03.275
if I have to repeat this year.

41:03.295 --> 41:06.629
But I'm really hoping
I don't have to.

41:06.856 --> 41:09.090
(scoffs softly)

41:11.194 --> 41:13.878
All right, Ms. Wilson.

41:13.955 --> 41:15.972
I'll give you a second chance.

41:16.123 --> 41:17.974
Next week.

41:18.125 --> 41:19.476
A practical exam

41:19.703 --> 41:22.353
with me and my patients.

41:27.301 --> 41:30.153
We will see just how good

41:30.380 --> 41:33.072
those instincts really are.

41:34.976 --> 41:37.235
<i> -(door opens)</i>
<i> -ATHENA: Bobby, are you home?</i>

41:37.387 --> 41:38.477
Hey.

41:38.571 --> 41:40.071
-Oh!
-What are you doing home?
I thought

41:40.165 --> 41:42.390
-your flight was tonight.
-Oh, Mama wanted

41:42.408 --> 41:44.242
her space back
and Daddy sent me away,

41:44.394 --> 41:46.836
so I thought I'd catch an
earlier flight to surprise you.

41:47.063 --> 41:48.563
-(laughs) Mwah.
-Mwah.

41:48.732 --> 41:50.081
Are you surprised?

41:50.233 --> 41:52.250
Yes, I am.
I'm happy to have you back home.

41:52.418 --> 41:54.235
Ooh, something smells good.

41:54.287 --> 41:55.494
-What are you cooking?
I'm starving.
-Well...

41:55.588 --> 41:58.664
-Yeah, that's-that's not for us.
-Oh, uh...

41:58.758 --> 42:01.000
Uh, no, no...
What is this?

42:01.094 --> 42:04.245
Well, Athena,
I would like you to meet Hoover.

42:04.338 --> 42:06.672
-Hmm.
-(Hoover whines)

42:06.766 --> 42:08.266
Like the vacuum cleaner?

42:08.360 --> 42:09.600
Exactly.

42:09.694 --> 42:11.194
(Hoover whines)

42:12.697 --> 42:15.014
<i> BUCK:</i>
<i> Thank you guys for</i>

42:15.033 --> 42:16.774
coming over.

42:16.868 --> 42:19.761
I've been giving this
a lot of thought.

42:19.854 --> 42:22.280
Uh, thinking about, you know,

42:22.432 --> 42:23.706
wh-where I am in my life

42:23.858 --> 42:26.100
and what I want, and...

42:26.119 --> 42:28.545
and how this would
fit in with that.

42:29.381 --> 42:31.172
And?

42:31.941 --> 42:33.941
Uh, and honestly, I...

42:33.943 --> 42:36.719
haven't figured any of that out.

42:36.871 --> 42:38.780
(chuckles)
I-I have

42:38.873 --> 42:41.540
no idea what I want.

42:41.634 --> 42:43.726
But it is clear to me...

42:45.397 --> 42:47.355
...that you know what you want.

42:48.733 --> 42:50.474
And one thing I do know is-is

42:50.627 --> 42:53.027
that I-I want
to help you have that.

42:55.240 --> 42:59.325
Are you... are you saying
what I think you're saying?

43:01.395 --> 43:03.204
I'm saying yes.

43:04.065 --> 43:05.397
I'm saying

43:05.566 --> 43:09.085
I will absolutely
be your sperm donor.

43:11.164 --> 43:12.755
Oh!
