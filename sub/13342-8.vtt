WEBVTT

01:03.291 --> 01:04.625
- Wow.
- Yeah?

01:04.625 --> 01:07.708
- I feel really good,
like we cracked it.
- I guess so.

01:07.708 --> 01:09.417
Oh, I was feeling
so angry at you,

01:09.417 --> 01:11.834
but I feel like you're
really supporting
my tenure now.

01:11.834 --> 01:14.291
I am, I do, of course.
I'm so proud of you.

01:14.291 --> 01:15.458
Of us, even.

01:15.458 --> 01:18.083
Get a load of those two,
the dread on their faces?

01:18.083 --> 01:19.750
- Jesus.
- ( scoffs ) I know.

01:19.750 --> 01:22.542
Uh, I feel
there's something
I want to share with you.

01:22.542 --> 01:24.500
- You do?
- Yeah, I do.

01:24.500 --> 01:28.166
I've been thinking lately
that I'm-- I'm gay.

01:28.166 --> 01:29.333
What?

01:29.333 --> 01:31.667
Not lately, actually.
For a while.

01:31.667 --> 01:33.750
( laughs )
Shut up, Tad.

01:33.750 --> 01:36.333
- What is this,
one of your stupid pranks?
- No, it's not.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.041
Loreen, you have
to listen to me.
I think I'm gay.

01:38.041 --> 01:40.291
- You think?
- No, I am.

01:40.291 --> 01:41.708
I don't think,
I am.

01:41.708 --> 01:43.834
- No, you're not.
- Why are you saying that?

01:43.834 --> 01:45.417
Oh, please,
you're not gay.

01:45.417 --> 01:47.041
I think it would've
come up.

01:47.041 --> 01:48.625
It is coming up right now.
I'm serious.

01:48.625 --> 01:51.667
This is ridiculous.
We were in therapy
two seconds ago.

01:51.667 --> 01:53.500
- You weren't gay in there.
- Yes, I was.

01:53.500 --> 01:54.917
I just didn't want
to share it with her.

01:54.917 --> 01:57.083
That is who
you're supposed
to be sharing it with,

01:57.083 --> 01:59.333
our therapist
who we pay.

01:59.333 --> 02:00.834
Yeah, I just
couldn't do it.
I don't trust her.

02:00.834 --> 02:05.583
- I call bullshit on this.
- Excuse me?

02:05.583 --> 02:08.375
You are unhappy, Tad.
You're not gay.

02:08.375 --> 02:10.750
You're just making this up
because you're a little
bit chickenshit.

02:10.750 --> 02:13.458
I'm not making this up.
I really don't think
I'm making this up.

02:13.458 --> 02:17.041
You cannot stand
the fact that I got tenure
before you did, can you?

02:17.041 --> 02:18.750
That's what this is about.
At the end of the day,

02:18.750 --> 02:21.625
every single fucking thing
comes down to misogyny,
doesn't it?

02:21.625 --> 02:23.208
Can you hear
yourself right now?

02:23.208 --> 02:25.125
This is a real display,
is what this is.

02:25.125 --> 02:28.625
You wait till your hand
is on the doorknob of
our therapist's office

02:28.625 --> 02:30.417
to tell me some lie
about being gay?

02:30.417 --> 02:32.708
Just man up, say you
don't want to fuck me!

02:32.708 --> 02:33.875
You think
that's what this is?

02:33.875 --> 02:35.291
That I want
to be saying this?

02:35.291 --> 02:37.208
I think you
want to be saying it
because you're saying it.

02:37.208 --> 02:39.208
You're saying it
to me right now,
right fucking now.

02:39.208 --> 02:42.041
All right, in hindsight,
this actually seems like
some pretty terrible timing.

02:42.041 --> 02:43.083
I wasn't planning it.

02:43.083 --> 02:45.875
I wanted to wait
until after your
tenure party.

02:45.875 --> 02:49.417
- I knew it was about that.
- Oh, fuck!

02:49.417 --> 02:51.917
I need to tell you this.
I have to tell you this,

02:51.917 --> 02:53.750
if for one second
you can try to fathom

02:53.750 --> 02:56.208
that this is not
all about you.

02:58.875 --> 03:01.667
It's not not
about me, Tad.

03:01.667 --> 03:03.750
It's not not.

03:11.208 --> 03:15.000
( music playing )

03:15.000 --> 03:16.250
( bell ringing )

03:16.250 --> 03:18.917
Okay, guys,
Miss Pontbriand's
gonna be back on Monday

03:18.917 --> 03:20.583
and, unlike me,
she's not easy.

03:20.583 --> 03:22.250
She's not gonna tolerate
a half-finished haiku.

03:22.250 --> 03:25.959
They're very short,
there are very few syllables,
so just go for it.

03:25.959 --> 03:27.583
What else do you have to do?
You're children.

03:27.583 --> 03:28.750
Have a great weekend.

03:32.583 --> 03:35.583
- 'Sup, Cleo?
- I don't even know.

03:35.583 --> 03:37.333
Is he being weird again?

03:37.333 --> 03:38.458
He's being so weird.

03:38.458 --> 03:40.625
He basically hasn't talked
to me since Tuesday

03:40.625 --> 03:42.291
when he
Facebook messaged me.

03:42.291 --> 03:44.458
Today he followed Tessa
to the 13th-floor gym

03:44.458 --> 03:46.291
and asked her
if she was into porn.

03:46.291 --> 03:49.041
Ew.
Is she into porn?

03:49.041 --> 03:52.375
I don't know.
I don't even know
how he would know.

03:52.375 --> 03:53.792
Listen, I don't
like him for you.

03:53.792 --> 03:55.417
I don't like
anyone here for you.

03:55.417 --> 03:56.959
I've checked out
every guy in this school

03:56.959 --> 03:58.417
and none of them
are cute.

03:58.417 --> 04:00.417
I don't even like him,
I'm just bored.

04:00.417 --> 04:02.208
I like Shia LaBeouf,
though.

04:02.208 --> 04:04.208
Well, Shia LaBeouf's
famous,

04:04.208 --> 04:08.125
so it's not like
you're gonna make
that connection.

04:08.125 --> 04:09.959
He lives in my building.

04:09.959 --> 04:11.875
He is hot.

04:11.875 --> 04:15.125
And I like the kind of, like,
light criminal activity.

04:15.125 --> 04:16.875
I think I can help him.

04:16.875 --> 04:19.666
I don't even like Mark.
He has HPV.

04:19.666 --> 04:20.708
He has HPV?

04:20.708 --> 04:22.500
I mean, the disease itself
isn't that big a deal.

04:22.500 --> 04:24.708
It's just kinda crazy
he has it when he's 14.

04:24.708 --> 04:27.417
He had sex with a girl
in Poland.

04:27.417 --> 04:28.667
Like, a Polish girl?

04:28.667 --> 04:31.917
Like, a girl from Long Island
who was on his team tour.

04:31.917 --> 04:35.333
Oh, my God,
where did they do it?
Like, the hotel?

04:35.333 --> 04:36.750
Auschwitz.

04:36.750 --> 04:39.041
They had sex
at Auschwitz?

04:40.500 --> 04:42.625
- Hi.
- Hello.

04:42.625 --> 04:44.000
Hi, Cleo.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.458
Hi, Mr. Parker.
Cool T-shirt.

04:46.458 --> 04:47.625
Oh, thanks.

04:47.625 --> 04:49.166
Yeah, my mom
got it for me.

04:49.166 --> 04:51.125
Cool.

04:51.125 --> 04:53.166
( laughs )

04:54.166 --> 04:56.000
- Okay.
- Okay.

04:57.542 --> 05:00.041
( quietly )
Okay, you just made
that so awkward.

05:00.041 --> 05:01.667
- No, I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

05:01.667 --> 05:04.500
You want to get
something pierced?

05:04.500 --> 05:06.041
I have a class
at 2:00 PM.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.834
I do, too.

05:09.417 --> 05:10.959
Okay.

05:10.959 --> 05:14.083
Like, upper ear cartilage
or something else?

05:14.083 --> 05:17.875
Mr. Parker left the date
because he was embarrassed.
He felt belittled.

05:17.875 --> 05:21.125
Yeah, but then he hasn't
mentioned it at all since
or followed up remotely.

05:21.125 --> 05:23.542
Yeah, because he thinks
you don't like him,
so he's being coy.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.750
- But I do like him. I think.
- ( music playing on
car stereo )

05:26.750 --> 05:28.208
I don't know yet.

05:28.208 --> 05:31.708
It seems to me you've made
poor relationship choices
in the past.

05:31.708 --> 05:33.875
Your ex seems
really damaged.

05:33.875 --> 05:35.291
He is really damaged.

05:35.291 --> 05:37.708
Oh, my God, Cleo,
you are so wise.

05:37.708 --> 05:39.750
♪ I know you're
never gonna wake up... ♪

05:39.750 --> 05:40.875
It's so weird
because this song

05:40.875 --> 05:42.333

we were just talking about.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.667
♪ I know I shouldn't
ever call back ♪

05:43.667 --> 05:46.708

06:00.834 --> 06:04.375

Come on.
- Go, run!

06:04.375 --> 06:06.417
Come here, sexy love.

06:08.667 --> 06:10.250
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:10.250 --> 06:11.291
What's happening?

06:11.291 --> 06:14.708
Uh, are you ready
to be stoked right now?

06:14.708 --> 06:17.458
Uh, yeah.
What's up?

06:17.458 --> 06:22.375
What's up is the contents
of this fucking amazing box

06:22.375 --> 06:26.750
that are about to change
our lives forever.

06:34.625 --> 06:36.750
- I mean...
- What?

06:36.750 --> 06:38.542
I just-- I have no idea
what these are.

06:38.542 --> 06:40.458
Okay, let me tell you.
I'll walk you through this.

06:40.458 --> 06:41.792
- What these are...
- Mm-hmm.

06:41.792 --> 06:44.250
...are the tightest
fucking German guitar pedals

06:44.250 --> 06:45.959
ever made
in history, okay?

06:45.959 --> 06:48.708
These pedals--
baby, these--

06:48.708 --> 06:51.375
- These pedals
are so sick.
- Yeah?

06:51.375 --> 06:54.125
These pedals single-handedly
created the distortion

06:54.125 --> 06:56.500
that became
the My Bloody Valentine
sound.

06:56.500 --> 06:59.708
- Uh-huh.
- They're gonna do the same
thing for us, I promise you.

06:59.708 --> 07:02.041
I didn't know we were
looking for a new sound.

07:02.041 --> 07:03.959
Well, maybe not right now,
but down the road.

07:03.959 --> 07:06.208
Thinking second album,
third album.

07:06.208 --> 07:07.625
( laughs )

07:07.625 --> 07:09.333
- You're so excited.
- Oh, my God.

07:09.333 --> 07:11.500
Oh, my God,
it was such
a sick deal, too.

07:11.500 --> 07:12.708
I couldn't pass it up.

07:12.708 --> 07:15.959
- How much were they?
- $2,000.

07:15.959 --> 07:17.667
Are you fucking serious?

07:17.667 --> 07:18.708
No way.

07:18.708 --> 07:20.917
- ( laughs ) I'm like, ah!
- Wait, Desi.

07:20.917 --> 07:23.083
That is our entire advance.

07:23.083 --> 07:24.333
$2,000?

07:24.333 --> 07:27.333
Yeah. I mean,
the guy had no idea
what he had.

07:27.333 --> 07:29.708
Desi, there's nothing
on this entire fucking planet

07:29.708 --> 07:31.834
that's worth
our whole advance.

07:31.834 --> 07:36.291
Whoa, I'm, like,
so super confused
right now, babe.

07:36.291 --> 07:37.959
I thought
you'd be psyched.

07:37.959 --> 07:39.208
No, no.
Why?

07:39.208 --> 07:41.375
Why on Earth would I be
excited about this?

07:41.375 --> 07:43.125
Marn, this is
our art, right?

07:43.125 --> 07:44.542
- ( sighs )
- This is what we do.

07:44.542 --> 07:47.375
This box makes
our art stronger, hon.

07:47.375 --> 07:49.208
No, those have
to be returned now.

07:49.208 --> 07:51.542
Okay, even if I wanted
to return them,

07:51.542 --> 07:53.166
which I powerfully
do not,

07:53.166 --> 07:54.625
that's not happening,
okay, babe?

07:54.625 --> 07:56.041
The guy's halfway
to Toronto by now.

07:56.041 --> 07:57.750
- Oh, my God.
- They're not
going back, hon.

07:57.750 --> 07:59.875
I cannot believe this.
$2,000, Desi.

07:59.875 --> 08:01.583
Do you know what else
that could've bought?

08:01.583 --> 08:03.375
$2,000 on that?

08:03.375 --> 08:07.750
I cannot believe you're
being such a fuckin' bitch
about this.

08:07.750 --> 08:09.041
- Fuck you, Desi.
- I'm walking.

08:09.041 --> 08:10.208
- Fuck you!
- All right!

08:10.208 --> 08:12.542
Go think about
this decision you made.

08:12.542 --> 08:13.792
( door closes )

08:13.792 --> 08:15.959
Desi:
Thanks for ruining my day!

08:15.959 --> 08:18.708
- Rain cloud.
- ( sighs )

08:18.708 --> 08:20.875
Fuck.

08:20.875 --> 08:23.125
The thing is,
if you really like him,

08:23.125 --> 08:26.250
you have to make it clear
that you're young, fun,
and flaky.

08:26.250 --> 08:29.875
Okay, Jessa, I stopped
taking advice from you
quite some time ago.

08:29.875 --> 08:32.166
Yeah, and notice
that since then

08:32.166 --> 08:35.250
you have been unemployed
with a sandy, broken vagina.

08:35.250 --> 08:37.582
I'm going through
the same thing right now,
Shoshanna,

08:37.582 --> 08:38.750
with regards to Ace.

08:38.750 --> 08:40.917
I've shown up at two
of his commercial shoots,

08:40.917 --> 08:42.875
and one time I was dressed
as a little match girl,

08:42.875 --> 08:45.250
and since then I haven't
picked up one of his calls.

08:45.250 --> 08:48.750
He tries to tell me
that, like, he's not
in a sexual place right now,

08:48.750 --> 08:50.542
but one more day
of radio silence

08:50.542 --> 08:53.959
and he will be knocking
at our front door, naked.

08:56.667 --> 08:58.500
I mean, this is
kind of your gift.

08:58.500 --> 09:00.750
It's kind of  my gift.

09:00.750 --> 09:03.959
Shoshanna, I have
four fucking suicide attempts
under my belt,

09:03.959 --> 09:06.625
men who just couldn't
live without me.

09:06.625 --> 09:08.250
Ace is different.
He's, like,

09:08.250 --> 09:10.625
so self-possessed
and random.

09:10.625 --> 09:12.250
Scott is so amazing, too.

09:12.250 --> 09:13.583
I mean, he's smart,
he's handsome.

09:13.583 --> 09:16.375
How the fuck
am I supposed to make
an impression on that?

09:16.375 --> 09:19.333
You have to, you know,
employ an element of surprise.

09:19.333 --> 09:21.708
Ooh, like jump out
from behind something
and scare him?

09:21.708 --> 09:26.458
No, like show him
an act of love when
he least expects it.

09:31.917 --> 09:34.291
What about
a frenulum piercing?

09:34.291 --> 09:35.959
- What?
- Your frenulum.

09:35.959 --> 09:37.917
It's like that webbing
under your tongue.

09:37.917 --> 09:39.875
And there's no way
your mom would ever see that.

09:39.875 --> 09:42.250
- That's gross.
- I think it's cool.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.250
I think it's, like, sexual,
but not too on the nose.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.583
And it could be like
a friendship thing.

09:46.583 --> 09:49.417
- We'll both do it.
- Okay.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.041
Hannah:
Excuse me?

09:51.041 --> 09:55.000
Could we get two
best "friendulum"
piercings, please?

09:55.000 --> 09:57.000
( snorts )

09:57.000 --> 09:58.333
Who wants to go first?

09:58.333 --> 09:59.834
She does.

10:05.417 --> 10:06.458
Which earring?

10:06.458 --> 10:09.875
I like the barbell.
That's kind of badass.

10:09.875 --> 10:11.291
Gold ring.

10:11.291 --> 10:14.500
Yeah, I think
the gold ring's
by far the way to go.

10:15.500 --> 10:16.625
( pats seat )

10:16.625 --> 10:19.458
- Can you hold this?
- Yeah, of course.

10:19.458 --> 10:21.875
Oh, look,
he is basically ready.

10:23.667 --> 10:25.834
So you just
plop down there.

10:25.834 --> 10:28.667
Just breathe.
It's really--

10:28.667 --> 10:32.041
it's gonna be
a chill process,
for sure.

10:32.041 --> 10:35.041
So, just so you know,
he's just getting
the clamp ready.

10:35.041 --> 10:37.542
He's putting a little bit
of a solution on the needle,

10:37.542 --> 10:39.166
which seems
like a good sign.

10:39.166 --> 10:42.417
Now he's just gonna
take the needle...

10:42.417 --> 10:43.542
( grunts )

10:43.542 --> 10:45.417
Hannah:
Putting the clamp.

10:45.417 --> 10:48.458
( muffled )
Are-- are you doing it?

10:48.458 --> 10:50.333
It's going right in--

10:50.333 --> 10:51.875
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:51.875 --> 10:53.083
- Okay.
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

10:53.083 --> 10:54.708
- Cleo, you okay?
- ( groaning )

10:54.708 --> 10:56.792
- Ah!
- Ow! Ow!

10:56.792 --> 10:58.166
I can't do this.
She's moving too much.

10:58.166 --> 11:00.375
Okay, you're moving too much,
so just pull this hand down.

11:00.375 --> 11:02.583
- Ow! Ow! Ow!
- It's halfway through.
You need to calm down.

11:02.583 --> 11:04.375
- Just shove it through.
- ( muffled ) Stop, stop...

11:04.375 --> 11:05.542
- Just push it through.
- ( Cleo moaning )

11:05.542 --> 11:07.208
Just push it through.
It's okay.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.708
- Ow! Ow!
- It's okay.

11:08.708 --> 11:10.542
It's okay, just push it
right through.

11:10.542 --> 11:11.875
( moaning, mumbling )

11:11.875 --> 11:13.583
- Don't-- Cleo...
- Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:13.583 --> 11:16.583
- ( Cleo screaming )
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
- Just keep it down.

11:16.583 --> 11:19.834
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:19.834 --> 11:21.125
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

11:21.125 --> 11:24.083
It's almost done.
It's almost done, okay?

11:24.083 --> 11:25.625
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

11:25.625 --> 11:28.583
- Hannah:
It's through, Cleo.
- ( whimpers )

11:28.583 --> 11:31.041
Cleo, it looks so good.

11:32.667 --> 11:34.250
( muffled )
Are you gonna go now?

11:34.250 --> 11:36.083
Fuck, no.

11:36.083 --> 11:37.458
You said
you were gonna go.

11:37.458 --> 11:39.625
Listen, let's get
friendship necklaces,

11:39.625 --> 11:40.917
friendship bracelets.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.583
But that was
fucking heinous
to watch.

11:42.583 --> 11:44.000
You're such a pussy.

11:44.000 --> 11:46.500
Listen, as an older woman
and as your friend,

11:46.500 --> 11:48.250
a great lesson
I can teach you

11:48.250 --> 11:50.625
is that it's okay
to change your mind.

11:50.625 --> 11:52.125
Show me.

11:53.166 --> 11:55.458
So cool!

11:55.458 --> 11:57.208
Hi, guys.
Do you live
in the district

11:57.208 --> 11:59.041
- and have a moment to talk
about the upcoming election?
- No.

11:59.041 --> 12:01.000
I don't know,
I think we should go.

12:01.000 --> 12:03.959
Okay, Ray, you need
to step up your game.

12:03.959 --> 12:07.125
- Step up my game?
- Shoshanna: Yeah.

12:07.125 --> 12:10.291
Hi, do you live
in the district and...

12:10.291 --> 12:12.291
Hi, excuse me.
This is Ray Ploshansky.

12:12.291 --> 12:13.917
He's running for community
board chairperson.

12:13.917 --> 12:17.417
He's in favor of no taxes
and also free bagels every
morning before 11:00.

12:17.417 --> 12:19.291
Man:
All right, I'm in.

12:19.291 --> 12:22.500
Wonderful,
thank you.

12:22.500 --> 12:24.917
- See you later.
- I'll see you  later.

12:24.917 --> 12:28.166
- Oh, not if I see you first.
- Not if I see you  first.

12:28.166 --> 12:29.500
All right, Tarzan,
let's wrap it up.

12:29.500 --> 12:31.875
Let's get you
down the block.
Thank you.

12:33.041 --> 12:35.834
- What the fuck was that?
- I'm campaigning.

12:35.834 --> 12:38.417
Shosh, you can't
just lie to people.
You know?

12:38.417 --> 12:41.166
Honesty is the one thing
separating me from other
politicians.

12:41.166 --> 12:43.458
Ray, no politician
is a fan of honesty.

12:43.458 --> 12:45.667
You have to focus
on results.

12:45.667 --> 12:47.875
The fact that you're
not already running

12:47.875 --> 12:49.959
a Fortune 500 company
is baffling to me.

12:49.959 --> 12:52.834
Okay, please, please,
can we not talk about
my stifled job situation?

12:52.834 --> 12:54.667
My brain really
needs a repose.

12:55.917 --> 12:57.458
Sure.

12:58.750 --> 13:00.834
- So how's the love life?
- Seriously, Ray?

13:00.834 --> 13:03.792
Shosh, I think we should
be able to talk about this
sort of stuff by now.

13:03.792 --> 13:06.834
- Don't you think?
- Okay.

13:06.834 --> 13:09.875
Well, then, since you asked,
I happen to have a date

13:09.875 --> 13:12.166
with a man who is
very much intriguing to me.

13:12.166 --> 13:13.375
Is that weird for you?

13:13.375 --> 13:14.708
No.

13:14.708 --> 13:16.875
No, I think that's great.

13:16.875 --> 13:20.166
I think you deserve someone
who's very much intriguing.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.291
- How about you?
- Me? I got nothin'.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.208
Crickets and tumbleweeds,
that's what I got.

13:27.208 --> 13:30.333
- I went on, um, eHarmony
the other day.
- ( gasps )

13:30.333 --> 13:32.583
Yeah, but I didn't
even start the process
of actually--

13:32.583 --> 13:34.250
- Ray!
- Would you like a flyer?

13:34.250 --> 13:35.625
- Ray, that's wonderful.
- Yeah.

13:35.625 --> 13:38.208
My best friend Zeva
met her soul mate
on eHarmony.

13:38.208 --> 13:40.208
And he used
to be a professional
baseball player,

13:40.208 --> 13:41.250
so there's no stigma.

13:41.250 --> 13:43.417
No, no, it's not that.
It's not a--

13:43.417 --> 13:46.542
There's someone I know
I don't want to be with.

13:46.542 --> 13:47.875
Like, I know it.

13:47.875 --> 13:49.208
I know we're not
the right fit, I get it.

13:49.208 --> 13:51.834
But despite that,
there's, you know--

13:51.834 --> 13:53.750
it's one of those things
where you're waiting
for your heart

13:53.750 --> 13:54.834
to catch up
to your brain.

13:54.834 --> 13:58.750
Ray, you are going
to find somebody,
I promise,

13:58.750 --> 14:01.041
who is so much more right
for you than I ever was.

14:01.041 --> 14:03.291
Shosh, that's so sweet
of you to say.

14:03.291 --> 14:07.667
I appreciate it,
but I'm actually not
talking about you right now.

14:07.667 --> 14:09.917
Well, then who are--

14:11.250 --> 14:13.000
fucking Marnie?!

14:13.000 --> 14:15.875
Okay, you don't
need to-- volume.

14:15.875 --> 14:17.041
Where are you going?

14:17.041 --> 14:19.375
I'm campaigning over here.
Excuse me, sir!

14:19.375 --> 14:22.083
- Okay, you don't--
- Ray Ploshansky!

14:22.083 --> 14:24.250
( car alarm chirps )

14:27.583 --> 14:30.583
( crying )

14:42.166 --> 14:43.792
You okay?

14:46.375 --> 14:48.583
I got two bottles
of Riesling.

14:48.583 --> 14:52.333
Riesling's too sweet.

14:52.333 --> 14:55.000
No one likes it.

14:55.000 --> 14:58.542
- Should I get
something else?
- Don't bother.

14:58.542 --> 15:00.625
( engine starts )

15:05.125 --> 15:07.625
Whoa, hey,
slow it down,
my brother.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.083
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:14.083 --> 15:16.458
- How's it going?
- Yeah, it's going.

15:16.458 --> 15:18.959
Just ol' National
History Day.

15:18.959 --> 15:21.875
I just wanted to apologize
about our date the other night.

15:21.875 --> 15:24.500
That was not the way
that I wanted to act.

15:24.500 --> 15:27.208
I kinda really
messed that one up.

15:27.208 --> 15:29.500
I kinda got away
from myself and...

15:29.500 --> 15:33.667
before the shit hit the fan,
I was having an amazing time.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.875
Well, I appreciate that.
Thanks.

15:35.875 --> 15:37.166
Yeah, no worries.

15:37.166 --> 15:40.417
I've been trying to make
some kinda better choices
in my life

15:40.417 --> 15:42.708
and, you know,
new choices,

15:42.708 --> 15:45.333
and I think
one of those choices
would be to hang out with you.

15:45.333 --> 15:48.041
- And, you know, make up
for the nonsense.
- Oh, yeah.

15:48.041 --> 15:50.917
Yeah.

15:50.917 --> 15:54.792
Uh, I can't do that.

15:56.166 --> 15:58.834
Okay, can you explain
why you can't do it?

15:58.834 --> 16:02.125
Is it, like,
a scheduling issue?

16:02.125 --> 16:05.041
Yeah, look, um,

16:05.041 --> 16:09.083
you're a very smart
and, uh, unusual person,

16:09.083 --> 16:11.583
and I like talking
with you very much.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.500
- Ditto.
- Cool.

16:13.500 --> 16:17.417
But I'm just trying
to, you know, not be
so attracted to drama.

16:17.417 --> 16:19.041
Uh, on the whole.

16:19.041 --> 16:22.417
To lead a calmer life,
as Mary J. Blige tells us to.

16:22.417 --> 16:25.625
My ex entirely drained
my bank account...

16:25.625 --> 16:28.208
- I'm sorry.
- ...and then--
well, thank you--

16:28.208 --> 16:31.625
finished it off by pouring
battery acid on my plant.

16:31.625 --> 16:33.041
Well, you wouldn't have
to worry about that with me

16:33.041 --> 16:34.750
'cause I don't even know
where you'd find battery acid.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.500
You, like, chop open
a bunch of batteries?

16:36.500 --> 16:38.208
That would take hours,
like making pomegranate juice.

16:38.208 --> 16:40.875
Hannah, Hannah,
I'm trying to be
gentle here.

16:40.875 --> 16:42.583
Fran, I'm not the person
that you think I am.

16:42.583 --> 16:45.208
I think you
are exactly the person
that I think you are.

16:45.208 --> 16:47.375
I think
you're not the person
that you  think you are.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.125
I think that's
where the confusion is.

16:49.125 --> 16:52.208
- Uh-uh.
- Yuh-huh.

16:52.208 --> 16:55.417
Look, just hear me
on this, okay, please?

16:55.417 --> 16:57.083
- You can walk away...
- Okay.

16:57.083 --> 16:58.917
- ...and I'm just gonna
leave you with this.
- Okay.

16:58.917 --> 17:01.834
And percolate on it
over the weekend like
your little coffee machine.

17:01.834 --> 17:02.959
Just...

17:02.959 --> 17:07.250
You're attracted to me,
you're intrigued by me,

17:07.250 --> 17:09.916
you think I'm a wild horse
and you want to tame me.

17:09.916 --> 17:12.750
I understand all of that.
It's the new frontier
of misogyny.

17:12.750 --> 17:15.500
Take a woman who's
in control of her life

17:15.500 --> 17:18.416
and then silence her.

17:18.416 --> 17:20.290
And I'm up for it.

17:23.040 --> 17:25.125
( sighs )

17:26.375 --> 17:29.917
- 'Sup?
- Hey, Rider.
Hey, Rainbow.

17:29.917 --> 17:35.083
Okay, she published
all of your emails
on her Tumblr?

17:35.083 --> 17:37.792
Yeah. I'm telling you,
she lost her mind.

17:37.792 --> 17:41.291
She decided
that I was the embodiment
of the white male oppressor.

17:41.291 --> 17:44.291
- Yeah.
- And I was like,
"Did I not just pay

17:44.291 --> 17:45.834
for your cat's
dialysis?"

17:45.834 --> 17:47.083
Bitches be cray.

17:47.083 --> 17:49.792
( laughs )
Yes, thank you.

17:49.792 --> 17:53.667
Well, anyway,
thank you so much
for joining me for a meal

17:53.667 --> 17:56.375
even though I know
we got off on a strange foot.

17:56.375 --> 17:58.125
No, it's--
I'm a renegade.

17:58.125 --> 18:01.041
You know, things
get crazy for me and, like,
you wouldn't be the first.

18:01.041 --> 18:03.041
Yeah, I'm also
totally unemployed,

18:03.041 --> 18:04.917
so I can pretty much
be anywhere at any time.

18:04.917 --> 18:08.333
Well, you won't be
unemployed for long
'cause you're a real doer.

18:08.333 --> 18:10.708
That's totally
what I thought,

18:10.708 --> 18:13.166
but this whole
experience has been,
like, so disheartening.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.667
I was so sure that I was
gonna be able to show, like,
all of my failure friends

18:16.667 --> 18:18.834
how easy it was
to have a viable job,

18:18.834 --> 18:21.500
but, no, I'm now
a failure, too.

18:21.500 --> 18:25.250
Okay, we don't use
those words--

18:25.250 --> 18:29.959
"failure," "pathetic,"
"loser," "lame."

18:29.959 --> 18:32.500
- Okay.
- Okay?

18:32.500 --> 18:34.000
Okay.

18:36.500 --> 18:37.708
What about "lamesauce"?

18:37.708 --> 18:39.208
( laughs )

18:39.208 --> 18:40.834
Um, okay, yeah.

18:40.834 --> 18:42.291
"Lamesauce" is okay.
I'll accept that.

18:42.291 --> 18:44.333
- Okay.
- That one's fine.

18:50.041 --> 18:51.375
Tad:
Hi, Shanaz!

18:51.375 --> 18:53.166
Yay! Hello!

18:53.166 --> 18:54.917
Shanaz, can we get
"Watchtower"?

18:54.917 --> 18:58.083
- It's those annoying
Seventh-day Adventists again.
- ( laughs )

18:58.083 --> 18:59.708
So I guess it takes
you getting tenure

18:59.708 --> 19:01.208
to finally get you
over here, huh?

19:01.208 --> 19:02.417
Well, you know
what they say,

19:02.417 --> 19:04.375
there's no party
like a tenure party.

19:04.375 --> 19:05.625
Who the hell says that?

19:05.625 --> 19:07.542
- It's Riesling.
It's too sweet.
- Oh.

19:07.542 --> 19:09.125
- Man: Thank you.
- It's not too sweet.

19:09.125 --> 19:10.834
If the Germans like it,
how sweet can it be?

19:10.834 --> 19:12.583
Man:
That's wonderful of you.
I'm so glad.

19:12.583 --> 19:14.166
We might not have
enough to eat otherwise.

19:14.166 --> 19:15.875
- ( laughs )
- Well, what can
we do to help?

19:15.875 --> 19:17.291
I know what would
be extremely helpful.

19:17.291 --> 19:19.083
How about if you
drank this drink,

19:19.083 --> 19:21.041
you walk
with me a little bit,
allow me to brag,

19:21.041 --> 19:23.125
and then I'm gonna show you
the galleys of my new book.

19:23.125 --> 19:25.291
- How about that?
- That sounds lovely,
delicious.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.500
- Here we go.
- Okay, cheers.

19:26.500 --> 19:28.083
- Girls,
catch you in a minute.
- Have fun, boys.

19:28.083 --> 19:29.750
Good luck, Tad.
You may need the whole bottle.

19:29.750 --> 19:32.083
- ( laughs )
- Oh, I invited
Gregg and Thyme.

19:32.083 --> 19:33.583
I know you hate them,
but I had to do it.

19:33.583 --> 19:36.291
Man:
Oh, come on, they have
those Hello Kitty lunchboxes.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.959
- They're nice.
- Tad: Hello Kitty?

19:38.959 --> 19:43.375
Okay, I know
it's not your style to be
the center of attention,

19:43.375 --> 19:45.959
but you worked for this.

19:45.959 --> 19:47.708
This is about you now.

19:47.708 --> 19:49.291
I am so proud of you.

19:49.291 --> 19:53.083
Oh, and furthermore,
fuck that little classicist

19:53.083 --> 19:55.250
who thought she was
gonna get your job.

19:55.250 --> 19:59.583
- ( laughs )
- Fuck her right in her
tiny little fuckface.

19:59.583 --> 20:03.375
It is good to know
I never have to move again.

20:03.375 --> 20:06.708
Is that it?
You always play
everything down.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.708
This is your party.

20:08.708 --> 20:12.125
- Yay, your party!
- Whoo! Whoo!

20:12.125 --> 20:15.083
Avi, this is fantastic.
I'm so happy for you.

20:15.083 --> 20:16.708
You're very kind.

20:16.708 --> 20:18.083
So how's yours coming?

20:18.083 --> 20:21.458
Aw, you know,
dribs and drabs.

20:21.458 --> 20:23.625
It's sort of
a weird time for me.

20:23.625 --> 20:26.667
- Yeah, honestly, I was
sort of wondering about that.
- Yeah.

20:26.667 --> 20:28.583
Yeah, I hope you
don't mind my asking.

20:28.583 --> 20:30.792
Are things okay
with you and Loreen?

20:30.792 --> 20:31.875
Oh, yeah.

20:31.875 --> 20:34.542
I noticed things looked,
well, sort of strained.

20:34.542 --> 20:37.708
Well, it's a challenging
moment, to be sure.

20:37.708 --> 20:40.208
Strange, you know?
I mean, I'm wondering,

20:40.208 --> 20:44.959
how late is too late
to change?

20:44.959 --> 20:46.708
You ever get
that feeling?

20:46.708 --> 20:49.291
Listen, this is something
everybody goes through.

20:49.291 --> 20:53.667
Trust me, Shanaz and I
have been through it
many, many times.

20:53.667 --> 20:54.708
Really?

20:54.708 --> 20:57.166
I mean, like, he was
12 years older than--

20:57.166 --> 20:59.959
I mean, sorry,
he is 12 years
older than I am

20:59.959 --> 21:01.708
- 'cause he's not dead.
- Yeah.

21:01.708 --> 21:04.083
And I was like,
"I want to be inspired
by someone.

21:04.083 --> 21:05.667
I want to be excited
by someone.

21:05.667 --> 21:07.125
I want to really
respect somebody."

21:07.125 --> 21:09.166
And I do, I do respect him
because he's his own man,

21:09.166 --> 21:10.625
and that totally
takes courage,

21:10.625 --> 21:12.667
but he's also,
like, a little bitch.

21:12.667 --> 21:14.875
( laughs )
Yeah, I get it.

21:14.875 --> 21:18.000
My ex, I think
she just wanted
to be the wife

21:18.000 --> 21:20.375
of a successful
business guy, you know?

21:20.375 --> 21:23.125
And go to parties
that Ivanka Trump
would be at

21:23.125 --> 21:26.625
and buy
a $17,000 couch,

21:26.625 --> 21:29.250
and that just was
never gonna work for me

21:29.250 --> 21:33.417
'cause I-- I want
to watch someone soar.

21:34.375 --> 21:36.834
Yeah, me, too.

21:38.375 --> 21:39.875
But enough
about the past.

21:39.875 --> 21:42.125
- Yeah.
- Let's look
towards the future.

21:42.125 --> 21:45.000
Totally.
Forward-looking.
That's the way to be.

21:45.000 --> 21:48.917
Like, I want to know
more about the future...

21:48.917 --> 21:51.291
of your cock.

21:51.291 --> 21:52.583
Excuse me?

21:52.583 --> 21:55.375
Yeah, I want to know
more about the future
of your,

21:55.375 --> 21:58.792
um, big hard cock
when I put my hand
around it

21:58.792 --> 22:01.208
and it gets so hard,
and then I shove it

22:01.208 --> 22:05.083
into my slimy vagina
like-- like one of
the Stalley pickles.

22:06.417 --> 22:08.625
- ( laughs )
- What? It's not funny.

22:08.625 --> 22:11.208
Sorry, it was
kind of funny.

22:11.208 --> 22:14.166
Shoshanna,
I like you, okay?

22:14.166 --> 22:16.667
And I also like the thought
of your hand on my cock,

22:16.667 --> 22:20.458
but not when half of the cast
of "The Good Wife"
is at the bar.

22:20.458 --> 22:22.083
What?
Oh, my God.

22:22.083 --> 22:23.333
- Oh, my God.
- You see 'em?

22:23.333 --> 22:25.083
- Oh, my God.
- I know.

22:25.083 --> 22:26.959
- That's Josh Charles.
- I know.

22:26.959 --> 22:28.750
- He died.
- I know, he's alive.

22:28.750 --> 22:29.708
Oh, my God.

22:29.708 --> 22:31.875
- ( music playing )
- ( laughing )

22:31.875 --> 22:34.250
You guys don't know
how lucky you have it.

22:34.250 --> 22:37.875
I mean, your Hannah's
a creative, what all
children should be.

22:37.875 --> 22:40.208
- Soraya is so...
- What?

22:40.208 --> 22:41.750
Look, I don't want
to be a bitch.

22:41.750 --> 22:43.834
She's my daughter,
I love her,

22:43.834 --> 22:45.083
but she's boring.

22:45.083 --> 22:47.375
Only you would be
bored by a daughter

22:47.375 --> 22:49.083
who's an infant
cardiac surgeon,

22:49.083 --> 22:50.625
- for Christ's sake.
- What could I do?

22:50.625 --> 22:52.917
- Lana smoked meth.
- Oh, Gregg.

22:52.917 --> 22:55.542
Well, she did.
We found out she
was smoking meth,

22:55.542 --> 22:57.333
so it could
always be worse.

22:57.333 --> 22:58.750
How the hell could it
be worse than that?

22:58.750 --> 23:00.959
She's a creative.
She's a professional
dancer.

23:00.959 --> 23:02.667
Oh, well, that's--
it's fine, then, yeah.

23:02.667 --> 23:05.083
- Well, uh--
- ( glass clinks )

23:05.083 --> 23:06.500
- I just want to--
- ( glass clinks )

23:06.500 --> 23:07.667
I just want
to make a toast.

23:07.667 --> 23:10.125
- Oh!
- Uh-oh, should I get out
the sleeping bags?

23:10.125 --> 23:11.291
This gonna be
an all-nighter?

23:11.291 --> 23:13.041
No, I promise
to make it short.

23:13.041 --> 23:15.333
- I just want to say that...
- ( laughs ) Good.

23:15.333 --> 23:17.041
...tonight I'm
so proud of my wife.

23:17.041 --> 23:19.875
- Aw.
- I am, my life partner.

23:19.875 --> 23:21.500
( laughing )

23:21.500 --> 23:22.959
My closest friend.

23:22.959 --> 23:24.625
( Loreen laughing )

23:24.625 --> 23:27.458
You're everything
to me.

23:27.458 --> 23:29.583
And these years
have been a gift.

23:29.583 --> 23:32.166
( laughing )

23:33.375 --> 23:35.166
And this honor
is well-deserved.

23:35.166 --> 23:36.708
Beyond that,
it's inevitable.

23:36.708 --> 23:41.959
And it's everything
that you-- that we wanted.

23:41.959 --> 23:44.417
( whispers )
What?

23:44.417 --> 23:47.333
( normal voice )
What I'm feeling is
something akin to pride.

23:47.333 --> 23:49.000
Excuse me.

23:49.000 --> 23:53.041
I cannot stand
to listen to this bullshit
for one more second.

23:53.041 --> 23:54.500
- Bullshit?
- Just not now, Tad.

23:54.500 --> 23:56.250
- Loreen.
- Not now.

23:56.250 --> 23:58.708
Come on.

23:58.708 --> 24:01.667
- ( footsteps depart )
- ( door slams )

24:01.667 --> 24:04.542
Avi:
Listen, she's had
a very big night.

24:04.542 --> 24:06.500
I really think we should
just enjoy ourselves,

24:06.500 --> 24:08.125
just eat,
just finish dinner.

24:08.125 --> 24:09.166
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Let's just eat, okay?

24:09.166 --> 24:12.250
- Shanaz: Good idea.
- Yeah, thanks, Av.

24:12.250 --> 24:14.041
( toilet flushes )

24:14.041 --> 24:17.333
( chatter )

24:17.333 --> 24:18.834
- Quick!
- Jesus, Avi.

24:18.834 --> 24:22.959
- No, super quiet.
Just be quiet.
- What? What?

24:22.959 --> 24:25.041
Oh, God.

24:26.041 --> 24:28.125
Are you insane?
Stop it.

24:28.125 --> 24:30.083
You didn't stop it
up at the lake
last summer.

24:30.083 --> 24:32.208
That was a mistake.
Just please stop.

24:32.208 --> 24:34.750
Listen, I know how things are.
I know you're having problems.

24:34.750 --> 24:37.375
- I know it, he told me.
- He told you?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.208
Listen to me.
I love you.

24:39.208 --> 24:41.458
- ( laughs )
- I love you, and I've
got to tell you now

24:41.458 --> 24:43.333
on the eve
of your tenure.
I love you.

24:43.333 --> 24:45.291
My feelings for you
are getting stronger
every single day.

24:45.291 --> 24:49.083
This is insane.
You have completely lost it.
Just let go of me.

24:49.083 --> 24:51.708
Listen to me, I see you.
I see the pain that you're in.

24:51.708 --> 24:53.500
It's coming off you
like a stink.

24:53.500 --> 24:56.166
You have no idea.
Just leave me alone.

24:56.166 --> 25:01.542
( laughing )
Jesus, what bad
fucking timing.

25:01.542 --> 25:03.667
All right, sorry.
( laughing )

25:03.667 --> 25:05.250
You needn't mock me.

25:05.250 --> 25:07.917
I'm not mocking you.
I'm not mock--

25:07.917 --> 25:11.041
( laughing )

25:13.250 --> 25:16.375
Just take a shower
or something.

25:28.250 --> 25:29.417
Hey.

25:29.417 --> 25:31.583
- Hi.
- Hey.

25:32.750 --> 25:35.583
I'm really sorry,
you know?

25:35.583 --> 25:37.083
Okay.

25:37.083 --> 25:39.917
I was so selfish
and, like...

25:41.542 --> 25:45.417
After I left,
I was just taking
a walk and...

25:45.417 --> 25:47.500
you know,
I started thinking
about my old man

25:47.500 --> 25:50.500
and I feel
really ashamed, Marn.

25:50.500 --> 25:52.583
Good.

25:52.583 --> 25:55.959
Hey, Marn, can you
stop typing for a sec?

25:55.959 --> 25:57.625
( phone clicks )

25:57.625 --> 25:59.750
Do you mind
if I sit down?

26:03.375 --> 26:05.625
Look, Marn...

26:05.625 --> 26:07.708
No, listen.

26:07.708 --> 26:10.750
I am not a materialistic
person at all.

26:10.750 --> 26:13.917
This is what tore
my parents' marriage apart.

26:13.917 --> 26:15.959
This is a real
fucking thing for me.

26:15.959 --> 26:17.875
Money destroys couples.

26:17.875 --> 26:21.792
- I couldn't agree--
- It destroys trust when
one person in a couple

26:21.792 --> 26:24.000
is misallocating funds
and is misusing the money--

26:24.000 --> 26:25.834
Marnie, please, baby,
shut up for a sec.

26:25.834 --> 26:27.375
There's something
I need to tell you.

26:27.375 --> 26:28.583
What the fuck
is your problem?

26:28.583 --> 26:30.166
Can you just--
I gotta say some--

26:30.166 --> 26:31.667
I gotta say
something here.

26:31.667 --> 26:32.875
- Okay.
- Can I talk?

26:32.875 --> 26:35.500
Yes, talk.
Jesus Christ.

26:35.500 --> 26:38.083
Today was the very
last day of my life

26:38.083 --> 26:40.959
that I ever want to make
a decision without you.

26:40.959 --> 26:42.500
Good.

26:48.708 --> 26:50.250
What's happening?

26:50.250 --> 26:51.417
( laughs )

26:51.417 --> 26:55.083
I'd always swore
that I would never
get married

26:55.083 --> 26:57.917
until my gay cousin
Destin could,

26:57.917 --> 27:00.500
but I can't wait
any longer, baby.

27:00.500 --> 27:04.166
Marnie Michaels,
will you marry me?

27:09.750 --> 27:12.875
( laughs )

27:12.875 --> 27:14.542
I love you.

27:14.542 --> 27:15.834
Des!

27:15.834 --> 27:19.166
I'm confused.
I'm so confused.

27:19.166 --> 27:20.542
So maybe you're wrong.

27:20.542 --> 27:22.208
I don't think I'm wrong.

27:22.208 --> 27:23.208
How do you know?

27:23.208 --> 27:24.583
Because this is
the hardest thing

27:24.583 --> 27:27.125
I've ever done in my life,
and I'm doing it.

27:27.125 --> 27:29.583
And truthfully I watch
a lot of gay pornography.

27:29.583 --> 27:31.333
Oh, God.

27:33.542 --> 27:35.041
So...

27:35.041 --> 27:37.458
you want to suck
a dick now?

27:37.458 --> 27:38.792
That's what
you want to do?

27:38.792 --> 27:39.792
You don't
have to be vulgar.

27:39.792 --> 27:41.208
No, I just want to know
if you mean it.

27:41.208 --> 27:43.583
You want a dick
in your mouth?

27:43.583 --> 27:46.041
- Loreen...
- You want to suck
someone else's dick?

27:46.041 --> 27:49.792
- Okay.
- Or do you want to put it
in somebody's ass...

27:49.792 --> 27:51.166
- All right.
- ...like in a...

27:51.166 --> 27:53.917
( phone ringing )

27:53.917 --> 27:56.542
It's probably Avi.

27:56.542 --> 27:59.291
He's in love with me.

28:02.750 --> 28:05.291
Oh, no, it's Hannah.
Hannah, our daughter.

28:05.291 --> 28:08.083
I'm not telling her.
You have to tell her.

28:08.083 --> 28:09.542
I'm not ruining
her childhood.

28:09.542 --> 28:12.000
I'm not telling her
her whole life has been a lie.

28:12.000 --> 28:13.333
All right,
I'll tell her.
I will.

28:13.333 --> 28:14.917
- ( phone beeps )
- Loreen: Hi.

28:14.917 --> 28:16.917
- Hi, Mommy.
- Loreen: Tell her.

28:16.917 --> 28:18.250
( whispering )
Not now, not on
the telephone.

28:18.250 --> 28:19.583
- Just tell her.
- No.

28:19.583 --> 28:22.625
Tell me what?
Wait, Mom, I need
to ask you something.

28:22.625 --> 28:25.750
Do you think
I'm a dramatic person?

28:25.750 --> 28:27.875
'Cause this guy that I like,
or don't even like...

28:27.875 --> 28:29.375
( sighs )

28:29.375 --> 28:31.417
I went on
one half date with him
and he claims to like me...

28:31.417 --> 28:33.166
- Sweetie.
- ...says I am too dramatic.

28:33.166 --> 28:36.458
I'm not dramatic.
I'm a person who's not
gonna sugarcoat things.

28:36.458 --> 28:40.417
- Sweets.
- I'm a person who really
gets a lot out of life.

28:40.417 --> 28:42.667
- Hey, Hannah?
- Okay, and I'm also a person

28:42.667 --> 28:44.291
who sees
the darkness in life.

28:44.291 --> 28:46.083
I'm not a fucking character
on "The Hills."

28:46.083 --> 28:47.917
I'm responding
to real issues.

28:47.917 --> 28:49.417
I'm responding
to the financial crisis.

28:49.417 --> 28:52.792
I'm responding to the fact
that so many people
are homeless.

28:52.792 --> 28:54.542
- Hey-- hey, Hannah?
- If that makes me dramatic,

28:54.542 --> 28:56.458
if that makes me
Courtney Love,

28:56.458 --> 28:58.500
you know,
then I can handle that,

28:58.500 --> 29:00.625
but the thing is,
it's like there's no way--

29:00.625 --> 29:04.083
Hannah!
Your father is gay.
