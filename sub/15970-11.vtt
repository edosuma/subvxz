00:01.800 --> 00:03.360
<i>Go now, go!</i>

00:03.440 --> 00:06.680
(theme music playing)

01:10.960 --> 01:12.080
(Bernice) Brian, honey!

01:12.600 --> 01:14.440
Are you ignoring me, sweetheart?

01:14.520 --> 01:17.680
If you are, it's okay. Just tell me.

01:17.760 --> 01:20.160
(Brian)
<i>My mother's a behavioral psychologist.</i>

01:20.240 --> 01:21.960
(Brian's dad)
Bernice, if you left him alone,

01:22.040 --> 01:24.200
maybe he'd break out
of this prolonged latency.

01:24.280 --> 01:26.240
(Brian)
<i>And my father's a Freudian psychiatrist.</i>

01:26.320 --> 01:28.760
(Bernice)
Our child is not in latency.

01:28.840 --> 01:30.800
(Brian's dad)
Keep living in denial, Bernice.

01:30.880 --> 01:33.960
(Brian)<i> Which basically means</i>
<i>that they fundamentally disagree...</i>

01:35.480 --> 01:37.000
<i>on, like, everything.</i>

01:37.080 --> 01:38.840
(Brian's dad)
Brian, everything all right?

01:40.200 --> 01:41.960
(Bernice)
Feel free not to respond.

01:45.520 --> 01:48.320
(Brian)<i> At Angela's house,</i>
<i>they probably, like, laugh</i>

01:48.400 --> 01:50.240
<i>and eat unbalanced meals...</i>

01:50.320 --> 01:53.000
<i>and talk about things that don't</i>
<i>have deep, symbolic meaning.</i>

01:53.920 --> 01:56.040
<i>They're probably this,</i>
<i>like, normal family.</i>

01:56.120 --> 01:59.720
-Ow! Child abuse!
-Well, it's tangled.

01:59.800 --> 02:00.840
Where the hell is it?

02:01.760 --> 02:02.760
Sweetie...

02:03.320 --> 02:05.680
I can't do braids in a basement.

02:05.760 --> 02:08.320
-It was right here.
-Fine. I'll do my braids myself.

02:09.120 --> 02:10.960
So this is actually happening?

02:11.960 --> 02:15.240
You're actually going
to wallpaper... the bedroom?

02:15.320 --> 02:16.800
Yeah. What's the big deal?

02:16.880 --> 02:20.160
Nothing... except this wallpaper sat here

02:20.240 --> 02:22.440
through the entire Bush administration.

02:23.120 --> 02:25.920
Well, I just figure
since I'm not working...

02:26.000 --> 02:27.200
it'll keep me off the streets.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.800
So you feel okay. About, um...

02:29.560 --> 02:32.080
I mean... you've done this before, right?

02:33.400 --> 02:36.240
-Patty, I can wallpaper a room.
-Right. I'm sorry.

02:37.520 --> 02:38.520
This is really great.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.760
(Brian) <i>I became yearbook photographer</i>
<i>because I liked the idea</i>

02:41.840 --> 02:44.320
<i>that I could watch life</i>
<i>without being part of it.</i>

02:46.280 --> 02:50.760
<i>But when you're yearbook photographer,</i>
<i>you're, like, never in the picture.</i>

02:50.840 --> 02:55.240
(mellow music playing)

02:56.520 --> 02:58.480
I'm yearbook photographer.
This is my job.

03:00.880 --> 03:03.880
Brian, I'd like you to meet
Delia. She's new.

03:05.600 --> 03:09.120
-It's really nice meeting you.
-Oh, yeah.

03:09.200 --> 03:10.840
Maybe I'll see you around?

03:14.240 --> 03:15.320
-Bye.
-Bye.

03:17.680 --> 03:18.720
Nice, Krakow.

03:18.800 --> 03:20.960
-Real suave.
-What?

03:21.960 --> 03:25.360
Well, it was pretty obvious
what she was thinking.

03:25.440 --> 03:26.880
What?

03:26.960 --> 03:30.000
She likes you. Ask her to the dance.

03:30.080 --> 03:31.840
Hold on. Wait.
This world happiness thing?

03:32.600 --> 03:34.280
It's not a thing.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.760
It's a dance, which I'm trying
to make into a great dance,

03:37.840 --> 03:39.720
which is, like, almost impossible

03:39.800 --> 03:43.120
since apparently the idea
of school spirit is out the window.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.920
So getting back to this Delia thing...

03:47.120 --> 03:50.000
She's working at big guy burger
tonight from 3:30 till 8:00.

03:50.080 --> 03:51.400
Did she actually say anything?

03:52.480 --> 03:57.000
Let's just say
it was very clearly implied.

03:57.760 --> 04:00.760
(indistinct chatter)

04:01.920 --> 04:04.240
-Hey, sweety.
-I mean, world happiness,

04:04.320 --> 04:05.240
who thought of that?

04:05.320 --> 04:07.640
-Sounds like Sharon.
-Definitely Sharon.

04:07.720 --> 04:10.440
-So are you, like, going?
-What?

04:10.520 --> 04:14.320
I know. I just thought, like,
It was really obvious way it'd be fun.

04:15.760 --> 04:19.240
Angela, if you expect Jordan Catalano
to, like, ask you.

04:19.320 --> 04:22.320
-Maybe she just wants to dance.
-Exactly.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.960
Wait. So there's, like, no chance?

04:26.040 --> 04:30.040
Angela, Jordan Catalano
doesn't go to school dances,

04:30.120 --> 04:31.600
as, like, policy.

04:32.120 --> 04:34.040
Right, I sort of figured, so...

04:34.120 --> 04:37.160
I mean, if you wanted to go,
which of course you don't...

04:38.400 --> 04:40.400
you could let Brian Krakow ask you.

04:40.480 --> 04:43.520
Brian, but... put him on hold.
If you don't hook Catalano,

04:43.600 --> 04:45.840
you've got Brain Krakow to pay.

04:45.920 --> 04:49.360
Then I'd be at the dance
with Brian Krakow.

04:49.440 --> 04:50.440
Excuse me.

04:51.320 --> 04:54.000
-Can we, like, help you?
-I was just...

04:55.040 --> 04:56.280
Is Miss Chavatal around?

05:00.600 --> 05:02.120
Do you see Miss Chavatal?

05:05.120 --> 05:06.320
Cool vest.

05:09.440 --> 05:14.000
(serene music playing)

05:14.600 --> 05:17.560
(Brian) <i>What's always amazed me...</i>
<i>is fishermen...</i>

05:18.640 --> 05:19.640
<i>how they wait there forever.</i>

05:19.720 --> 05:23.360
<i>When something finally tugs on their line,</i>
<i>they, like, don't panic.</i>

05:24.720 --> 05:25.880
<i>The strange thing is...</i>

05:26.400 --> 05:29.600
<i>even though I've established</i>
<i>verbal communication with Delia Fisher,</i>

05:29.680 --> 05:31.880
<i>I still think about Angela, constantly.</i>

05:33.240 --> 05:36.480
<i>Why am I like this?</i>
<i>I truly sicken myself.</i>

05:36.560 --> 05:38.240
<i>I just have to stop</i>
<i>being her little puppet.</i>

05:38.320 --> 05:41.600
<i>I vow to never again show up</i>
<i>at Angela's door with some lame excuse.</i>

05:41.680 --> 05:43.040
Hi.

05:43.120 --> 05:44.240
Uh, I mean, hello.

05:45.920 --> 05:48.160
I sort of lent this atlas to Angela,

05:48.880 --> 05:51.720
which she was technically
supposed to return in march.

05:51.800 --> 05:53.640
Oh, well, she isn't here now.

05:59.400 --> 06:03.600
-Uh, could you, uh...
-Oh... right. Right.

06:05.800 --> 06:07.560
So, putting up wallpaper?

06:09.320 --> 06:10.520
Lower, lower.

06:11.360 --> 06:13.560
Wait. The morning glories
aren't lined up.

06:14.760 --> 06:17.680
Um, in my room,
one seam's a little off,

06:18.160 --> 06:19.560
and I stare at it constantly.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.320
It's, like, destroying me.

06:23.400 --> 06:25.040
So you're, like, what, retired?

06:25.120 --> 06:28.680
I mean... I mean, not retired.
(chuckles)

06:29.440 --> 06:34.320
Uh, no, I'm, uh...
sort of planning what to do next.

06:36.000 --> 06:38.120
I don't want to jump
into anything blindly. You know?

06:41.040 --> 06:42.680
I mean, it's... it's, uh...

06:44.840 --> 06:45.840
like wallpaper.

06:48.400 --> 06:50.280
There are hundreds of patterns out there.

06:50.880 --> 06:51.880
It's kind of daunting,

06:51.960 --> 06:55.360
because you're going to have to live
with your decision for a long time.

06:58.360 --> 07:02.680
Let's say you're deciding
between two particular patterns...

07:03.920 --> 07:08.200
and one of them you definitely
know that you really like.

07:09.200 --> 07:11.240
And the other one is nice wallpaper,

07:11.320 --> 07:13.560
but you're just not sure if it's really...

07:15.120 --> 07:17.000
-For you.
-Exactly.

07:18.880 --> 07:22.000
But the really great wallpaper,
let's say is, like...

07:22.680 --> 07:24.240
totally out of your price range.

07:25.080 --> 07:30.760
So... do you take the other wallpaper...
even though you don't, let's say,

07:30.840 --> 07:32.160
really desire it that much,

07:32.240 --> 07:37.200
or do you wait until the really
great wallpaper is...

07:38.960 --> 07:39.960
cheaper.

07:41.360 --> 07:45.760
Well, I guess it depends on
how badly you need wallpaper.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.520
I would say pretty badly.

07:49.000 --> 07:50.480
Well, I guess that says it.

07:51.360 --> 07:52.360
Yeah.

07:53.760 --> 07:56.680
(indistinct chatter)

07:56.760 --> 07:58.160
(Brian) <i>I can't believe this.</i>

07:58.880 --> 08:01.240
<i>Apparently Delia Fisher smiles</i>
<i>at everyone.</i>

08:01.880 --> 08:04.360
<i>She probably comes from one of those</i>
<i>small towns where everyone's friendly</i>

08:04.440 --> 08:07.520
<i>and smiles at you for no reason.</i>
<i>I hate that type of town.</i>

08:08.000 --> 08:10.080
Thanks for eating at Big Guy.

08:10.560 --> 08:12.360
Hi. Welcome to big guy burger.

08:13.760 --> 08:14.760
Hi. (sighs)

08:15.600 --> 08:16.600
Hi.

08:18.320 --> 08:20.520
Welcome to Big Guy Burger,
where every guy's a big guy.

08:21.120 --> 08:24.560
I was just... you know,
happened to be in the neighborhood so...

08:24.640 --> 08:26.240
What can I get you?

08:28.760 --> 08:30.440
Oh, um...

08:31.760 --> 08:33.440
just a... hunk burger.

08:35.080 --> 08:36.080
For here or to go?

08:39.280 --> 08:40.880
I guess to go.

08:40.960 --> 08:44.480
I just... you know should... probably go.

08:48.120 --> 08:49.840
(Brian)
<i>There's something about my life.</i>

08:51.080 --> 08:54.040
<i>It's just automatically true</i>
<i>that nothing actually happens.</i>

09:03.240 --> 09:05.360
-(Delia) Not hungry after all?
-Oh.

09:06.040 --> 09:08.960
I was told not to eat red meat
by my, uh, doctors.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.160
Oh.

09:10.640 --> 09:13.080
I'm sorry about being...
so standard in there.

09:13.160 --> 09:16.160
-The manager, like, watches us.
-Oh.

09:16.240 --> 09:18.680
-(car siren blares)
-Right.

09:18.760 --> 09:20.120
I'm glad you came.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.600
(Brian)<i> Somewhere far away</i>
<i>there was a car alarm...</i>

09:23.680 --> 09:25.880
<i>one of those really annoying ones.</i>

09:25.960 --> 09:27.360
Do you want a sip?

09:27.440 --> 09:29.200
(car alarm blaring indistinctly)

09:29.760 --> 09:32.920
(soft music playing)

09:37.080 --> 09:38.600
(Brian)<i> But suddenly...</i>

09:40.120 --> 09:42.080
<i>it was the best sound I had ever heard.</i>

09:42.160 --> 09:46.120
(car alarm blaring indistinctly)

10:01.640 --> 10:02.960
So, I guess I should go.

10:06.200 --> 10:07.200
Me, too.

10:17.040 --> 10:19.120
(Brian)
<i>So maybe this is what people mean...</i>

10:21.000 --> 10:25.920
<i>when they talk about, you know... life.</i>

10:32.960 --> 10:36.520
(bell rings)

10:36.600 --> 10:40.440
So... are you going to ask me
to this dance or what?

10:41.800 --> 10:42.880
I was going to...

10:44.200 --> 10:45.200
eventually.

10:45.840 --> 10:50.720
Oh. So... you just haven't
gotten around to it.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.120
Exactly.

10:54.200 --> 10:58.080
(whistle blows indistinctly)

10:58.160 --> 10:59.360
Look, Kyle,

11:00.040 --> 11:02.960
I am under a ton of pressure here, okay?

11:03.040 --> 11:05.960
The dance committee,
student council, yearbook, band.

11:07.080 --> 11:12.520
I don't have time to worry about
being alone at the very dance I organized.

11:13.440 --> 11:14.440
Fine.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.680
Would you like to go to the dance with me?

11:18.240 --> 11:19.240
Yes.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.120
And if you screw this up...

11:26.000 --> 11:29.520
I will really hate you. Like, forever.

11:30.680 --> 11:35.360
(indistinct chatter)

11:36.160 --> 11:37.880
(Brian) <i>My life is so ridiculous.</i>

11:38.880 --> 11:42.000
<i>I have to ask Delia Fisher to the dance.</i>
<i>I have to.</i>

11:42.720 --> 11:44.880
<i>I'll do it now on the count of three.</i>

11:45.440 --> 11:47.960
<i>One, two...</i>

11:48.720 --> 11:51.400
<i>-three.</i>
-(bell rings)

11:51.480 --> 11:53.000
I'll catch you later.

11:55.040 --> 11:56.200
(Brian)<i> Speak!</i>

11:57.360 --> 12:03.440
(indistinct chatter)

12:11.680 --> 12:14.360
(indistinct chatter)

12:14.440 --> 12:16.720
-Hey, what's going on?
-Oh, not much.

12:17.760 --> 12:18.800
So...

12:19.400 --> 12:23.400
-you going to the dance?
-Uh, doubtful. You?

12:23.880 --> 12:26.560
I would kind of have to say
at this point...

12:27.920 --> 12:28.920
no.

12:29.000 --> 12:33.520
(indistinct chatter)

12:39.480 --> 12:43.560
Guidance is so weird. (laughs)

12:44.600 --> 12:47.200
She looked at me all concerned,

12:47.280 --> 12:49.680
wanting to know
if I was going to the dance,

12:49.760 --> 12:53.400
like that wasn't the stupidest
question in history. And so...

12:54.200 --> 12:55.960
I broke down and cried. (laughs)

12:57.040 --> 12:58.560
It was hysterical.

12:59.120 --> 13:01.280
But how's it going?
How are you doing?

13:02.760 --> 13:03.760
10 days.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.120
No drink, no drugs.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.880
I'm so clean, you could eat off me.

13:09.480 --> 13:12.360
So, you know that girl Pam Troy?

13:13.280 --> 13:15.720
-The one with the bad perm?
-No.

13:15.800 --> 13:17.840
The one with the diamond stud in her nose.

13:17.920 --> 13:19.720
Oh, the one with the...

13:20.440 --> 13:24.480
the crop tops, and she broke down
and cried in human sexuality?

13:25.040 --> 13:26.080
Yeah, so?

13:26.160 --> 13:28.160
I was thinking of asking her to the dance.

13:28.240 --> 13:31.640
-Why?
-I know you think the dance is stupid.

13:31.720 --> 13:34.400
-Why not ask him?
-Shut up.

13:35.000 --> 13:37.320
Isn't that who you really want to go with?

13:37.960 --> 13:38.960
Well, isn't it?

13:39.560 --> 13:42.920
Yeah, in some imaginary universe
that exists in my mind.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.480
Leave it to me.

13:45.480 --> 13:47.440
If you say one word to him, I'd kill you.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.080
Rayanne!

13:50.800 --> 13:51.880
Hi.

13:54.080 --> 13:56.440
Are those morning glories not lining up?

13:57.560 --> 13:58.560
They're lining up.

13:59.080 --> 14:01.760
Because he know, If they're even
the slightest bit off,

14:01.840 --> 14:04.120
that's all you're ever going to notice.

14:05.080 --> 14:06.280
Is that a bubble?

14:07.560 --> 14:10.240
Patty, I tried every conceivable
way to get rid of that bubble.

14:10.320 --> 14:13.120
It is there forever.
It's part of our lives.

14:13.200 --> 14:15.320
It will outlive us all.

14:16.000 --> 14:19.600
So I dropped off that brochure
I did for the university

14:19.680 --> 14:22.360
with their precious perforations.

14:22.440 --> 14:27.760
Oh, um, while I was there,
I picked up a continuing-ed bulletin.

14:30.600 --> 14:32.680
Why'd you circle all these
cooking classes?

14:32.760 --> 14:34.640
Why do you think?

14:34.720 --> 14:36.320
Isn't that what you talked about?

14:36.400 --> 14:38.920
This is an adult-ed workshop.

14:39.000 --> 14:41.760
I talked about going full-time
to a culinary institute.

14:41.840 --> 14:44.080
-Which we can't afford.
-Which we can't afford, I know.

14:44.160 --> 14:47.480
But that we can afford. So
why are you closing your mind?

14:49.200 --> 14:51.440
Will you at least think about it?

14:52.240 --> 14:53.240
Okay.

14:53.800 --> 14:54.800
Great.

14:55.520 --> 15:00.640
-(birds chirping)
-(indistinct chatter)

15:02.400 --> 15:07.200
(car engine sputtering)

15:13.080 --> 15:14.080
Hi.

15:15.160 --> 15:16.160
Hey.

15:18.200 --> 15:19.520
Did you hear about that thing

15:19.600 --> 15:22.160
that they're going to exterminate
fourth-period lunch?

15:22.760 --> 15:24.040
I didn't hear that.

15:24.640 --> 15:27.200
Oh, it's just something people
are obsessing about.

15:29.040 --> 15:33.520
Sometimes people fill their minds
with all these stupid things, you know,

15:33.600 --> 15:37.920
to keep themselves from thinking
about what's really important.

15:39.680 --> 15:40.920
Huh.

15:42.360 --> 15:46.480
Like this world happiness dance.
I mean, it's so stupid.

15:46.960 --> 15:48.880
What does that even mean?

15:48.960 --> 15:51.320
Like if we dance,
the world will get happier?

15:51.400 --> 15:54.120
I mean, really, come on.
I don't think so.

15:54.800 --> 15:55.800
There's a dance?

15:56.840 --> 15:57.840
Uh, yeah.

15:58.440 --> 16:02.240
You know, there's, like,
500 posters up around the school about it.

16:02.960 --> 16:04.360
Oh, right.

16:07.000 --> 16:11.120
I guess I kind of mean the idea...
of the dance is kind of...

16:11.960 --> 16:12.960
false.

16:14.520 --> 16:16.480
I doubt I'm even going.

16:17.280 --> 16:20.760
I mean, I'm sure you're obviously
not going. Right?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.320
See, I have this philosophy.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.320
You have a philosophy?

16:28.800 --> 16:31.160
If I go somewhere,
and someone I know is there...

16:31.760 --> 16:33.360
then cool. There's something...

16:34.360 --> 16:35.560
natural about it.

16:36.280 --> 16:38.600
But once you start making plans,
then you have, like...

16:39.240 --> 16:40.960
like, obligations.

16:42.120 --> 16:43.760
And that basically blows.

16:44.400 --> 16:45.680
So my feeling is...

16:46.840 --> 16:49.240
whatever happens, happens.

16:50.520 --> 16:52.600
I have to say I really respect that.

16:54.840 --> 16:56.320
(Jordan sighs)

17:04.200 --> 17:08.680
(car door closes, engine starts,
music plays)

17:08.760 --> 17:12.640
Oh, I, um... forgot my geometry book
in my locker, so...

17:13.640 --> 17:20.320
(music continues playing in stereo)

17:22.360 --> 17:25.680
(bell rings)

17:37.040 --> 17:38.280
Hi.

17:41.000 --> 17:42.000
Hi.

17:42.840 --> 17:44.280
I've been looking for you all day.

17:44.360 --> 17:46.680
I've been, like... really busy.

17:46.760 --> 17:48.920
-I'm carrying a triple minor.
-Oh.

17:49.880 --> 17:51.640
I didn't know you can have a triple minor.

17:51.720 --> 17:54.200
They sort of bent the rules for me. So...

17:55.040 --> 17:57.600
Miss Chavatal wants me to catch
up with the rest of the unit...

17:58.280 --> 17:59.880
since I just transferred here.

18:01.840 --> 18:04.160
I have no idea what I'm even looking at.

18:16.440 --> 18:18.640
Oh, simple. They're just paramecia.

18:20.120 --> 18:21.120
Can I look?

18:21.200 --> 18:23.040
(serene music playing)

18:23.120 --> 18:25.040
(bell rings indistinctly)

18:25.120 --> 18:26.160
(Brian)<i> Finally.</i>

18:26.720 --> 18:29.400
<i>An erection from actual physical contact.</i>

18:29.480 --> 18:31.920
(Delia) What are the little
hairy things around the edges?

18:34.320 --> 18:36.520
Those are... cilia.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.840
They, like... propel the paramecia.

18:42.560 --> 18:43.600
You're a lifesaver.

18:43.680 --> 18:48.960
(serene music playing)

19:08.840 --> 19:11.400
(announcer) My So Called Life
<i>will continue here on ABC.</i>

19:26.440 --> 19:28.080
(birds chirping)

19:28.160 --> 19:29.840
Remember when we were
discussing wallpaper?

19:29.920 --> 19:30.960
Okay, lower.

19:31.040 --> 19:33.520
(dog barking indistinctly)

19:33.600 --> 19:34.600
A little bit lower.

19:35.160 --> 19:36.640
It's just so weird

19:37.320 --> 19:40.320
when you've, like...
chosen your wallpaper,

19:40.400 --> 19:43.800
and... you think you're pretty
happy with it,

19:43.880 --> 19:48.320
but just... every time you pass
by the other wallpaper,

19:48.400 --> 19:50.000
the one you sort of liked more...

19:50.080 --> 19:53.000
Brian, we're not talking about
wallpaper here, are we?

19:53.080 --> 19:54.640
Maybe not.

19:54.720 --> 19:56.520
(door thuds)

19:57.520 --> 20:00.200
Oh, Brian Krakow's here. Good.

20:00.280 --> 20:03.680
-Hi. I was just...
-Yeah, helping. I know. Thank you.

20:03.760 --> 20:07.000
Hey, did you get a chance
to look at that bulletin?

20:07.960 --> 20:09.080
Not yet.

20:09.160 --> 20:10.640
You know, I should've mentioned.

20:11.800 --> 20:14.440
Tomorrow's the last day of registration.

20:14.520 --> 20:16.240
That's all right. I'll do it next time.

20:16.880 --> 20:18.920
Because, you know,
there are some very important chefs

20:19.000 --> 20:20.480
running some of those classes.

20:20.560 --> 20:21.960
Oh, sure? Like who?

20:22.040 --> 20:25.000
-Steffan Dieter.
-Who?

20:26.000 --> 20:29.520
You know, that guy from the TV show
<i>Steffan's Kitchen.</i>

20:30.560 --> 20:31.640
That guy died.

20:31.720 --> 20:34.480
-He did not die.
-You sure?

20:34.560 --> 20:38.320
Graham... can I just say
I don't understand?

20:38.400 --> 20:42.600
I thought that, um...
you planned to do this.

20:45.000 --> 20:48.400
What at this point of way things are now,
it doesn't feel right to make plans.

20:49.040 --> 20:52.880
I'd rather... let... whatever
happens, happen.

20:52.960 --> 20:57.560
-(birds chirping)
-(dog barking indistinctly)

20:58.360 --> 21:00.080
-So.
-So.

21:01.400 --> 21:03.080
Have you thought about the dance?

21:03.760 --> 21:06.840
-Um, not much. Have you?
-No.

21:09.440 --> 21:11.520
It's just that if I'm not going
to work Saturday,

21:11.600 --> 21:13.560
I have to... switch with someone.

21:14.040 --> 21:15.040
Right away.

21:15.720 --> 21:16.720
I see.

21:17.840 --> 21:23.400
So, I mean, if I'm going to go,
I would need to know... like, now.

21:25.840 --> 21:28.520
That's... yeah.

21:28.600 --> 21:31.480
(indistinct chatter)

21:31.560 --> 21:32.640
Hmm.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.040
May be we could put something
in right here.

21:35.120 --> 21:40.360
(car engine revving)

21:40.440 --> 21:41.640
Rayanne's right.

21:42.440 --> 21:43.440
About what?

21:44.120 --> 21:45.640
Corey and the dance.

21:46.520 --> 21:49.880
-She told you?
-It's okay. I understand.

21:49.960 --> 21:51.640
No, you don't understand.

21:52.520 --> 21:55.160
You don't understand
because... you don't. You couldn't.

21:55.240 --> 21:57.000
Oh, you're right, Rickie.

21:57.080 --> 21:59.880
I couldn't possibly understand
having an obsession for a person

21:59.960 --> 22:02.240
I have zero hope of ever
becoming involved with.

22:04.760 --> 22:06.000
We're hopeless.

22:07.840 --> 22:11.000
And so, in conclusion, I guess,
the truth is that

22:11.080 --> 22:15.680
I can't, you know, um...
work, like... 24 hours a day.

22:17.560 --> 22:19.120
All work and no play or whatever.

22:19.200 --> 22:21.240
Uh, Brian? Brian?

22:22.000 --> 22:23.440
Are you asking me to the dance?

22:26.080 --> 22:27.080
Yeah.

22:28.200 --> 22:29.440
I thought so.

22:31.760 --> 22:34.800
Angela... maybe we should go.

22:35.400 --> 22:36.600
You know, to that stupid dance.

22:37.600 --> 22:39.280
Oh, my God. We should go together.

22:39.360 --> 22:41.440
Right. 8:00?

22:42.400 --> 22:43.400
8:00.

22:43.480 --> 22:46.440
I feel so much better
to know that it's settled.

22:47.200 --> 22:50.280
Hey, Rickie... so see you Saturday, right?

22:50.360 --> 22:51.360
Excuse me?

22:51.440 --> 22:55.360
Rayanne said the three of us
are going to hang together. At the dance?

22:55.960 --> 22:57.760
Did I get that wrong?

22:58.240 --> 23:01.440
Oh, no. I mean.
You got it completely right.

23:02.040 --> 23:04.760
Cool. So... Saturday.

23:08.480 --> 23:09.480
So I guess I...

23:10.360 --> 23:13.000
should go with you and Rayanne
and Corey, right?

23:13.080 --> 23:14.160
Sure.

23:15.360 --> 23:18.840
I mean, except that...
it might seem like you and I are together.

23:19.480 --> 23:20.720
Like a boy-girl thing.

23:21.480 --> 23:24.320
-It might?
-Well, yeah. Like a double date?

23:25.520 --> 23:26.640
Yeah. I guess...

23:27.120 --> 23:28.280
I guess it might.

23:28.360 --> 23:31.600
Whereas if it's just me
and Corey and Rayanne.

23:32.200 --> 23:34.840
Wait a second. Oh, my God.
This is too obvious, isn't it?

23:34.920 --> 23:36.560
I mean, maybe you should come.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.360
No. I shouldn't.
You know, you're right.

23:41.240 --> 23:43.040
I got to go find Rayanne.

23:43.120 --> 23:45.320
(footsteps receding)

23:50.840 --> 23:51.840
Hi.

23:52.640 --> 23:55.360
Can I talk to you for minute?
It's kind of an emergency.

23:56.600 --> 23:57.600
We were just...

23:58.200 --> 24:01.240
No, it's okay. I got to go anyway.

24:01.320 --> 24:03.640
So... see you Saturday?

24:06.440 --> 24:07.600
Yeah.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.120
So you, like, asked her to the dance?

24:13.200 --> 24:14.200
Yes.

24:15.040 --> 24:16.040
In fact, I...

24:16.640 --> 24:19.640
you know, just wanted to go with
someone, so I just thought her.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.160
So I asked.

24:21.880 --> 24:23.800
It was, you know, that simple.

24:25.320 --> 24:26.840
She seemed pretty much blown away.

24:27.480 --> 24:28.960
That's great.

24:31.440 --> 24:33.480
Look, this is gonna sound really weird.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.760
Rayanne's doing this thing for Rickie...

24:36.840 --> 24:39.720
because he has an enormous
crush on someone.

24:39.800 --> 24:40.800
And, um...

24:42.080 --> 24:44.040
it's just this very delicate balance.

24:44.120 --> 24:47.680
I know you're going with Delia,
and I'm really happy for you...

24:47.760 --> 24:50.280
(Brian) <i>And as she continued</i>
<i>to basically babble,</i>

24:51.360 --> 24:54.440
<i>it started to sink in that something</i>
<i>truly amazing was happening.</i>

24:54.520 --> 24:59.000
Since we're neighbors,
it'd be sort of convenient if...

25:00.800 --> 25:04.400
if there was just some way
I could go along.

25:04.480 --> 25:06.640
(Brian)<i> When you stripped away</i>
<i>all the blathering,</i>

25:06.720 --> 25:08.000
<i>Angela Chase...</i>

25:08.640 --> 25:11.400
<i>was asking to go to the dance with me.</i>

25:11.480 --> 25:13.200
I mean, Just to, like, get me there.

25:14.040 --> 25:16.280
Not that we'd actually be going together.

25:16.360 --> 25:18.720
-Of course.
-No, I mean, not to go go,

25:18.800 --> 25:23.560
'cause you're going with Delia.
I just need a technical way to get there.

25:25.960 --> 25:27.120
It's not a problem.

25:28.720 --> 25:31.440
I mean, fine. Tag along.

25:32.360 --> 25:33.520
Thanks.

25:33.600 --> 25:39.120
(mellow music playing)

25:39.640 --> 25:40.680
(bell rings)

25:40.760 --> 25:42.200
Can he excuse us?

25:44.680 --> 25:46.520
-Later, Rayanne.
-How could you do that?

25:46.600 --> 25:48.560
-What'd I do?
-What did you do?

25:48.640 --> 25:51.400
You invited Corey to the dance
with you and me

25:51.480 --> 25:53.280
when I specifically told you not to.

25:53.360 --> 25:56.720
-Oh, that.
-He painted your shoes.

25:58.120 --> 26:01.720
-Want me to ask him to do yours?
-Rayanne. (sighs)

26:03.760 --> 26:06.320
Listen to me. This isn't funny.

26:07.080 --> 26:09.000
You've driven me crazy in the past,

26:09.080 --> 26:12.680
but I'll overlook it because the truth is,
I want to go to the dance.

26:13.400 --> 26:15.800
But if you say one word to embarrass me

26:15.880 --> 26:18.840
while the three of us are together...
what?

26:19.680 --> 26:20.680
I won't be there.

26:22.080 --> 26:23.080
What?

26:25.080 --> 26:27.480
I just don't think,
I'm not ready to go to an event like that.

26:28.200 --> 26:29.960
I talked to the counsellor and she said...

26:30.240 --> 26:31.440
she doesn't think I'd be able to...

26:31.520 --> 26:34.520
Who cares about your
stupid drinking problem!

26:34.600 --> 26:35.720
This is my life!

26:36.960 --> 26:40.360
-Don't worry. It's no problem.
-Yes, it is.

26:40.440 --> 26:44.840
(indistinct chatter)

26:44.920 --> 26:48.520
I will call Corey.
I will explain the whole thing.

26:49.280 --> 26:50.440
It'll be fine.

26:51.760 --> 26:53.720
(indistinct chatter)

26:53.800 --> 26:55.200
(Rickie sighs)

26:59.760 --> 27:06.000
(serene music playing)

27:28.080 --> 27:29.080
Hi.

27:30.840 --> 27:33.320
-Did you want to talk to me?
-Yeah.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.360
How are you?

27:39.760 --> 27:41.480
Brian. I only have, like, a minute.

27:42.000 --> 27:43.120
-So...
-Right.

27:44.080 --> 27:47.000
-So it's sort of about the dance.
-Oh.

27:48.480 --> 27:50.360
It turns out that I kind of forgot,

27:50.960 --> 27:53.520
you know, about this other
commitment that I already had.

27:54.760 --> 27:58.000
It's kind of, you know,
special or whatever, so I...

27:58.080 --> 28:00.640
(Brian)<i> Of all the stupid things</i>
<i>I've said, which were like, calm less.</i>

28:01.720 --> 28:04.040
<i>I never wanted to take something</i>
<i>back more than that one.</i>

28:06.040 --> 28:09.240
Maybe we can go somewhere else sometime.
Catch a movie or whatever.

28:10.920 --> 28:12.720
This other commitment...

28:14.760 --> 28:16.520
is it another girl or something?

28:19.040 --> 28:20.160
Brian, look.

28:21.360 --> 28:24.960
It doesn't matter who you told first...
if it was her or if it was me.

28:26.640 --> 28:28.400
You should go with
who you want to go with.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.360
Just be honest with me, please.

28:33.600 --> 28:34.600
Okay.

28:34.680 --> 28:38.160
(birds chirping)

28:38.240 --> 28:39.480
So I guess I would.

28:41.240 --> 28:42.640
You would what?

28:44.360 --> 28:45.560
Rather go...

28:48.040 --> 28:49.960
you know, with her.

28:50.520 --> 28:55.840
(mellow music playing)

28:55.920 --> 28:56.960
I'm really sorry.

28:59.280 --> 29:02.120
It would be really good
if you would leave.

29:02.200 --> 29:03.120
Delia.

29:03.840 --> 29:04.920
Please.

29:05.000 --> 29:09.480
(mellow music continues)

29:21.680 --> 29:23.720
(bell tolling)

29:23.800 --> 29:26.640
(footstep approaching)

29:28.600 --> 29:31.480
I know this is weird,
but just take a look at this?

29:46.960 --> 29:47.960
So what does this mean?

29:48.760 --> 29:50.360
So you enrolled me?

29:50.440 --> 29:51.440
Yeah.

29:52.160 --> 29:55.480
I know, that you've had your hands full
with the wallpaper and everything, so...

29:56.320 --> 30:00.840
Graham, I just had this feeling
like you're really going to enjoy this.

30:00.920 --> 30:02.000
You signed me up.

30:04.400 --> 30:05.400
Yeah.

30:07.840 --> 30:11.680
I know that...
sometimes it's hard for you to...

30:11.760 --> 30:12.720
What?

30:14.560 --> 30:15.680
Focus.

30:21.200 --> 30:22.320
Graham, look...

30:23.400 --> 30:25.480
I just thought...

30:26.200 --> 30:29.920
-I know you like to cook...
-It's not that I like to cook.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.440
It's this thing I can just do.

30:33.080 --> 30:36.240
-The one thing I can do.
-That's just the point, sweet heart.

30:36.320 --> 30:37.640
-(doorbell rings)
-I'll get it.

30:38.880 --> 30:42.280
-Honey, I mean... ask who it is first.
-Who is it?

30:42.840 --> 30:43.920
Brian Krakow.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.520
Oh, my God.

30:48.600 --> 30:49.800
Oh, my God.

30:53.800 --> 30:55.960
We're, um, going to that dance thing.

30:56.040 --> 30:58.640
We're actually not going with each other.

31:01.200 --> 31:02.600
Oh, my God.

31:05.520 --> 31:07.840
You know something?
When I want to, I can focus just fine.

31:07.920 --> 31:09.680
So we're picking Delia up?

31:09.760 --> 31:11.400
Wait a second. Um...

31:11.480 --> 31:15.240
your father is picking the three of you up
after the dance, right?

31:16.600 --> 31:18.400
As it turns out, Delia can't go.

31:19.200 --> 31:20.600
Wait a second. Why?

31:21.400 --> 31:23.240
It's her aunt, actually.
She's, you know...

31:23.840 --> 31:25.320
actually in the hospital.

31:30.560 --> 31:33.320
Oh, I hope it isn't anything too serious.

31:36.240 --> 31:37.320
(Patty) Graham.

31:38.080 --> 31:39.720
I'm sorry, okay.

31:39.800 --> 31:40.800
Graham.

31:42.720 --> 31:43.800
Wow.

31:44.840 --> 31:46.520
Oh, my God.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.480
This room looks amazing.

31:51.120 --> 31:52.200
Wow!

31:53.920 --> 31:57.640
(chuckles) I guess we found
another thing you can do.

32:02.960 --> 32:03.960
You're welcome.

32:13.200 --> 32:14.560
My God.

32:16.720 --> 32:18.120
(sighs)

32:18.680 --> 32:22.400
Did you see her face when he told her
that other girl wasn't coming?

32:24.800 --> 32:27.600
They're going to have
such a terrible time.

32:34.080 --> 32:35.080
Look...

32:36.240 --> 32:39.360
I know you probably feel
like you can't breathe sometime,

32:39.440 --> 32:42.920
like I'm this...
horrible nag or something.

32:44.360 --> 32:45.960
Feel free to stop me...

32:46.920 --> 32:47.920
anytime.

32:52.760 --> 32:55.800
Look, I'll... put a stop on the check.

32:55.880 --> 32:59.320
-I'll call the registrar and tell them...
-Don't do that.

33:02.680 --> 33:06.800
I sort of have to see if Steffan Dieter
can still stiffen his egg whites.

33:09.080 --> 33:10.840
I mean, since I'm already signed up.

33:13.200 --> 33:14.240
I mean...

33:17.000 --> 33:18.960
thank you for signing me up.

33:20.160 --> 33:26.040
(loud music playing)

33:36.680 --> 33:39.680
So finally, the mouse runs
across the classroom

33:39.760 --> 33:41.440
and starts chasing Mrs. Shindelheim,

33:41.520 --> 33:43.160
which is when she tripped
over Nicholas Cahill.

33:43.240 --> 33:45.840
Which is why she's wearing
that neck brace.

33:47.400 --> 33:49.080
You're, like, really funny.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.240
So where's Rayanne?

33:55.960 --> 33:59.080
-She didn't call you?
-No. Why?

34:00.840 --> 34:04.360
She told me she was going
to call you because she's not...

34:05.880 --> 34:09.080
-she's not coming.
-Why?

34:10.920 --> 34:14.040
-It's kind of a long story.
-Oh.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.400
So she's not coming at all.

34:18.360 --> 34:19.920
No. Sorry.

34:21.880 --> 34:23.120
You don't have to be sorry.

34:24.560 --> 34:26.760
I wanted to ask her
how she liked her sneakers.

34:28.240 --> 34:30.320
Well, Rayanne is very...

34:31.240 --> 34:32.360
changeable.

34:34.800 --> 34:38.240
It's just weird, you know?
When you have a picture...

34:39.160 --> 34:42.400
of how something's gonna be
and it turns out completely different.

34:44.480 --> 34:47.080
Yeah. It is weird.

34:47.160 --> 34:53.560
(loud music continues)

34:59.120 --> 35:01.520
-Lot of people.
-Yeah.

35:02.040 --> 35:04.280
(Brian) <i>Okay. This is the simplest thing</i>
<i>in the world.</i>

35:04.960 --> 35:08.560
<i>People do it every day.</i>
<i>Just start a conversation.</i>

35:09.840 --> 35:13.040
-Wow.
-Yeah. So...

35:14.000 --> 35:18.120
-could you get me something to drink?
-Oh, okay. What do you want?

35:19.440 --> 35:20.520
You know, whatever.

35:20.600 --> 35:26.640
(crowd cheering)

35:34.160 --> 35:35.520
-Oh, hi.
-Hi.

35:35.600 --> 35:42.160
(party music playing)

35:55.640 --> 35:57.880
-Hey.
-Oh, hi.

35:57.960 --> 36:00.480
So, um,
you and Angela come together?

36:01.400 --> 36:02.760
Um, sort of.

36:04.440 --> 36:06.600
I was thinking of hanging with you guys,

36:06.680 --> 36:09.080
but I didn't know if you were here
as friends or...

36:09.160 --> 36:13.480
if it's an actual thing... you know,
whatever's better for you.

36:16.720 --> 36:17.920
Whatever.

36:21.080 --> 36:23.760
I mean... maybe you shouldn't come over.

36:25.360 --> 36:28.080
We might want to, like,
dance or something.

36:29.480 --> 36:30.800
That's... that's really great.

36:37.400 --> 36:39.200
(party music playing)

36:39.280 --> 36:41.400
(crowd cheering)

36:41.480 --> 36:43.840
-It's punch.
-Thanks.

36:43.920 --> 36:46.960
-What did Rickie want?
-Nothing.

36:48.360 --> 36:49.520
What did you say to him?

36:49.600 --> 36:51.160
Nothing, I just said,

36:51.240 --> 36:53.200
it was better that maybe
he didn't hang out with us.

36:53.280 --> 36:56.240
-What?
-I thought that might be awkward.

36:57.080 --> 36:58.400
Rickie's my friend.

36:59.320 --> 37:00.320
He's my friend, too.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.080
It's just... what if we...

37:03.880 --> 37:05.960
I don't know. If we wanted
privacy or something?

37:07.160 --> 37:10.400
-Why would we want privacy?
-Well, we probably wouldn't.

37:11.000 --> 37:13.800
-But...
-Brian...

37:14.760 --> 37:17.600
-what do you think is happening here?
-What? Nothing.

37:17.680 --> 37:20.680
Didn't I explain
what the reasoning for this was?

37:20.760 --> 37:23.400
I just thought if we wanted
to, say, dance.

37:23.480 --> 37:25.800
Why would we... we're not going to dance.

37:25.880 --> 37:29.600
I realize that.
It wasn't some big plan or anything.

37:30.720 --> 37:34.480
I don't even believe in making plans.
Whatever happens happens.

37:34.560 --> 37:37.200
That's the stupidest thing
I've ever heard in my life.

37:37.280 --> 37:38.800
(party music continues)

37:38.880 --> 37:40.880
(indistinct chatter)

37:40.960 --> 37:42.760
What did you say to Delia?

37:44.760 --> 37:46.240
What do you mean?

37:48.400 --> 37:50.600
You don't understand people, Krakow.

37:52.080 --> 37:54.280
You're so heartless!

37:54.360 --> 37:57.680
(music fades)

37:57.760 --> 38:00.440
(crowd cheering)

38:05.440 --> 38:10.560
(serene music playing)

38:11.720 --> 38:14.120
(Brian)
<i>The fact that she called me heartless...</i>

38:15.080 --> 38:16.920
<i>that's just really good. That's excellent.</i>

38:17.560 --> 38:19.880
<i>How ironic can you get</i>
<i>without, like, puking?</i>

38:23.760 --> 38:30.480
(upbeat music playing)

38:45.840 --> 38:47.040
I... I was really wrong.

38:48.120 --> 38:49.480
I, like, realize that now.

38:50.280 --> 38:54.240
That what I did was... pretty heartless.

38:54.320 --> 38:56.000
Or whatever.

38:56.080 --> 38:59.080
-I am so glad you made it.
-Yeah.

38:59.160 --> 39:01.800
-You know Kyle, right?
-Yeah. Hi.

39:03.320 --> 39:05.440
You know what? I'm glad
you decided to come on your own.

39:05.520 --> 39:06.680
It's better.

39:06.760 --> 39:09.720
There are many cute guys
for you to meet.

39:11.080 --> 39:12.240
Okay.

39:13.240 --> 39:19.080
(upbeat music playing)

39:24.880 --> 39:27.280
So Rayanne never called Corey.

39:31.240 --> 39:32.680
Would you like me to kill her?

39:35.320 --> 39:36.800
That's really a nice offer,

39:36.880 --> 39:39.520
but the truth is, that would
only solve half the problem.

39:40.800 --> 39:42.160
What's the other half?

39:44.640 --> 39:46.960
The other half is, like, you know...

39:48.200 --> 39:49.280
the tough half.

39:51.760 --> 39:53.280
Which is...

39:54.520 --> 39:57.320
Which is, like, just... you know...

40:01.400 --> 40:03.200
that I belong nowhere...

40:04.120 --> 40:05.320
with no one.

40:07.920 --> 40:09.880
That I don't fit.

40:11.680 --> 40:17.760
(music playing in background)

40:23.720 --> 40:24.800
I'm starving.

40:24.880 --> 40:25.880
What do you think?

40:25.960 --> 40:27.320
Let's go get something to eat.

40:27.400 --> 40:29.920
Hey, I got to pick up Kimmy too.
She's gone out for work.

40:30.400 --> 40:32.800
-Hey, Catalano, let's go, man.
-Let's go.

40:32.880 --> 40:34.920
-All right.
-We're going to Cathy's first, right?

40:35.000 --> 40:37.560
Yeah, There's a killer place
to check out later.

40:37.640 --> 40:38.720
Yeah, in a minute.

40:40.280 --> 40:45.080
(music continues playing in background)

40:45.160 --> 40:46.560
It's okay.

40:51.080 --> 40:52.080
Go.

40:55.880 --> 41:01.160
(music continues playing in background)

41:04.520 --> 41:05.520
Hey.

41:27.160 --> 41:28.360
Why are you like this?

41:30.160 --> 41:31.160
Like what?

41:34.520 --> 41:35.520
Like how you are.

41:35.600 --> 41:38.280
-Hey, Jordan, you coming or not?

41:42.400 --> 41:43.880

(bike engine revving)

44:10.840 --> 44:14.080
(serene music playing)

44:14.160 --> 44:15.200
Hi.

44:15.280 --> 44:20.880
(serene music playing)

44:23.920 --> 44:25.760
Brian, this was all my fault.

44:25.840 --> 44:27.560
(Brian) <i>Her hair smelled incredible.</i>

44:28.400 --> 44:30.160
I mean, I ruined your night...

44:30.920 --> 44:32.480
and Delia's night.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.440
I should've just stayed out of it.

44:34.520 --> 44:37.320
(Brian)<i> Her hair smelled like this</i>
<i>orange grove we passed when I was 8</i>

44:37.400 --> 44:38.920
<i>on the way to see my grandmother.</i>

44:39.640 --> 44:40.720
And I...

44:41.520 --> 44:44.440
I can't really explain why
I even got involved.

44:45.840 --> 44:47.000
But I'm sorry.

44:47.080 --> 44:50.560
(Brian)<i> But I guess that's just like</i>
<i>her shampoo, or whatever.</i>

44:50.640 --> 44:55.280
(serene music continues)

44:55.360 --> 44:56.760
These things are so stupid.

44:58.040 --> 45:00.440
I know. No one ever
has a good time.

45:02.520 --> 45:03.520
So...

45:04.120 --> 45:05.240
I don't know.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.800
You want to dance or something?

45:10.600 --> 45:11.840
Not with you.

45:15.360 --> 45:16.560
Well, I'm just...

45:18.680 --> 45:21.960
I just...
I don't care about dancing...

45:23.080 --> 45:24.080
that much.

45:26.680 --> 45:27.920
Me either.
