00:11.112 --> 00:13.045
Onward, john! Onward!

00:13.047 --> 00:16.515
On this ballistic
Episode of "Mythbusters"...

00:18.052 --> 00:20.519
a cinematic
Cadavercarrying conundrum...

00:22.256 --> 00:24.490
this myth is about
Picking up a dead body.

00:24.492 --> 00:27.292
And using it as cover
During a firefight.

00:27.294 --> 00:29.395
One!

00:29.397 --> 00:30.496
And...

00:31.665 --> 00:33.599
a tall tale Of bombproof...

00:35.269 --> 00:36.869
Boom! It even went...

00:36.871 --> 00:38.070
Goo.

00:38.072 --> 00:39.538
It's time to put it
To the ultimate test.

00:39.540 --> 00:42.274
To see if oobleck
Is actually bombproof.

00:42.276 --> 00:45.844

01:12.873 --> 01:16.742
first up is
A classic action movie myth.

01:16.744 --> 01:19.511
The lead is flying,
Our hero cornered.

01:19.513 --> 01:23.082
Desperate for cover, he grabs
A recently deceased extra.

01:23.084 --> 01:26.518
To use as a human shield,

01:26.520 --> 01:29.788
But can an uncooperative
Cadaver really be carried.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.523
In a gunfight scenario?

01:31.525 --> 01:34.326
And is it actually bulletproof?

01:34.328 --> 01:39.098
Or is this silverscreen
Scene dead weight?

01:39.100 --> 01:40.165
This is cool.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.267
Let's break it down.

01:42.269 --> 01:44.703
First up, you need to know, can
You hold up a dead as a shield?

01:44.705 --> 01:48.707
So can you actually pick it up
And heft it around?

01:50.711 --> 01:51.877
- Like that?
- That's great.

01:51.879 --> 01:53.879
Just pushups with a dead body.

01:53.881 --> 01:56.048
And we need to figure out
If a body is bulletproof.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.282
That would be important.

01:57.284 --> 01:58.350
Because there is no point
In hefting it around.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.585
If it's just a piece
Of tissue paper.

01:59.587 --> 02:01.487
Yeah. I've got the perfect
Solution for that.

02:01.489 --> 02:03.122
- Great.
- Cool.

02:03.124 --> 02:06.625
- Ready?
- Yep. Okay.

02:06.627 --> 02:09.595
Boomer, our accurate
Human syndaver...

02:09.597 --> 02:11.330
So just pull the pants up.

02:11.332 --> 02:13.665
Is the just
The dead guy for the job.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.701
Look at that!

02:15.703 --> 02:19.505
He's proved his take
One for the team credentials.

02:19.507 --> 02:21.707
On airbag disaster.

02:21.709 --> 02:24.543
No!

02:24.545 --> 02:26.345
And fresh...
- nice.

02:26.347 --> 02:27.679
Ooh. That was moist.

02:27.681 --> 02:29.548
From a factory reset...

02:29.550 --> 02:30.883
Come on, bring it.

02:30.885 --> 02:33.852
At 150 pounds,
He's ready to roll.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.420
There we go.

02:35.422 --> 02:36.522
- Beautiful.
- Good boy.

02:36.524 --> 02:37.856
A little style.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.591
You got to look sharp.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.860
This myth is about
Picking up a dead body,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.695
Using it as cover
During a firefight.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.697
1, 2, 3.

02:45.699 --> 02:47.166
I worked in emergency medicine,

02:47.168 --> 02:49.368
And I've experienced
Moving a few dead bodies.

02:49.370 --> 02:51.103
Got to keep his head clean.

02:51.105 --> 02:52.504
- There we go.
- Okay.

02:52.506 --> 02:54.072
- You ready?
- Yeah.

02:54.074 --> 02:56.341
And the thing you learn
Is, when they say "Dead weight".

02:56.343 --> 02:58.343
It means totally different
Than just weight.

03:03.617 --> 03:06.618
Okay.

03:06.620 --> 03:07.719
How does this look?

03:07.721 --> 03:09.888
He's still moist.

03:09.890 --> 03:11.390
What do you think?

03:11.392 --> 03:14.726
I mean, it's got heft to it.
It's like dead weight, but...

03:14.728 --> 03:16.495
Okay, but if I was out there
Shooting at you,

03:16.497 --> 03:17.596
How would you feel?

03:17.598 --> 03:19.631
Are you glad
You're hugging a body?

03:19.633 --> 03:20.899
Yes.

03:20.901 --> 03:23.468
It's like having a friend.

03:23.470 --> 03:27.906
So john can lift
And carry the cadaver,

03:27.908 --> 03:29.675
But to put this myth to
The test,

03:29.677 --> 03:32.811
They need objective data.

03:32.813 --> 03:36.248
Yeah!

03:36.250 --> 03:40.419
Brian and jon set up
A 100footlong course.

03:40.421 --> 03:44.656
They'll both run the gauntlet
With boomer in tow, ducking,

03:44.658 --> 03:47.459
Dodging, and weaving
As if under fire...

03:47.461 --> 03:51.430
3, 2, 1, go!

03:51.432 --> 03:54.066
And average their times.

03:54.068 --> 03:57.069
To find out how long it'll take.

03:57.071 --> 04:02.040
3, 2, 1, go!

04:03.444 --> 04:08.280
Okay. I can't his legs to bend.

04:08.282 --> 04:10.215
Yeah, so the heroes in moves,

04:10.217 --> 04:12.484
They sweat a lot less.

04:14.622 --> 04:16.788
But I'm actually
A little bit surprised.

04:16.790 --> 04:19.458
Because it's possible
To pick up a body.

04:19.459 --> 04:21.125
And carry it like
A human shield.

04:21.128 --> 04:24.763
Yeah. Feeling super safe.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.398
Keep going. Keep going.

04:26.400 --> 04:28.166
Spin that. Yeah!

04:28.168 --> 04:32.471
All right. Keep going.
You feel that in your legs?

04:32.473 --> 04:35.207
I thought it was just some
Kind of hollywood stunt.

04:35.209 --> 04:37.042
Here we go. Finish line.

04:37.044 --> 04:39.044
- End!
- Yeah!

04:39.046 --> 04:41.079
Nice job.

04:41.081 --> 04:43.615
- How is it?
- Weird.

04:45.519 --> 04:48.920
Done!

04:48.922 --> 04:53.025
Hoo!

04:53.027 --> 04:55.527
It's not as easy as it looked.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.263
But next up, guns and ammo.

04:58.265 --> 05:02.200
Let's do it.

05:02.202 --> 05:07.406
But before the saga
Of the cadaver continues...

05:07.408 --> 05:11.276
Cue myth number two.

05:11.278 --> 05:16.648
Can a nonnewtonian liquid
Protect you from a bomb blast?

05:16.650 --> 05:18.550
This ballistic mystery balances.

05:18.552 --> 05:20.919
On the strange
Material properties.

05:20.921 --> 05:23.055
Of nonenewtonian fluids...

05:23.057 --> 05:26.792
Apply a force and it
Temporarily thickens so much,

05:26.794 --> 05:29.561
It behaves like a solid,
But does that mean.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.297
It can deflect
An explosive pressure wave?

05:32.299 --> 05:36.702
Is this an internet fable
Or feasible physics?

05:36.704 --> 05:38.136
In order to test this myth,

05:38.138 --> 05:39.971
We need to define
What is bombproof.

05:39.973 --> 05:41.640
You ready to make up
Some oobleck?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.075
- Definitely.
- All right.

05:43.077 --> 05:44.543
According to the center
For disease control,

05:44.545 --> 05:47.212
At about 10 p.S.I.
You occur lung damage,

05:49.883 --> 05:50.949
So that 10p.S.I. Threshold's.

05:50.951 --> 05:52.217
What we're gonna need.

05:52.219 --> 05:54.319
We're gonna see
If oobleck can reduce.

05:54.321 --> 05:57.255
The pressure below
That threshold.

05:57.257 --> 06:00.025
It's still liquidy,
But I think I'm there.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.594
So will
A nonnewtonian fluid reduce.

06:02.596 --> 06:05.797
The supersonic blast wave
Of a high explosive.

06:05.799 --> 06:10.669
To a survivable 10 p.S.I?

06:10.671 --> 06:13.638
First up, the mysterious matter
In question.

06:13.640 --> 06:16.608
Oobleck is make of two
Very common ingredients...

06:16.610 --> 06:17.976
Corn starch, for cooking,

06:17.978 --> 06:20.479
And water,
For keeping you alive.

06:20.481 --> 06:23.148
And when these two
Things combine,

06:23.150 --> 06:25.751
They create a magical
Substance known as oobleck...

06:25.753 --> 06:27.285
All right.
You ready for the punch test?

06:27.287 --> 06:28.987
Which actually comes
From a dr. Seuss story,

06:28.989 --> 06:30.422
"Bartholomew and the oobleck,."

06:30.424 --> 06:31.823
Where bartholomew has
To save a kingdom.

06:31.825 --> 06:34.726
From a sticky,
Gooey substance...

06:34.728 --> 06:37.329
Ooh!

06:37.331 --> 06:39.564
And this stuff is cool.

06:39.566 --> 06:45.003
Whoahohoho.

06:45.005 --> 06:48.039
So what exactly
Is going on here?

06:48.041 --> 06:50.709
Well, that's had scientists
Baffled for a while.

06:50.711 --> 06:54.346
What?

06:54.348 --> 06:55.847
But starch is key to it.

06:55.849 --> 06:57.849
It's made of long,
Coiled polymer chains.

06:57.851 --> 06:59.985
That tend to flow around
Each other just fine,

06:59.987 --> 07:02.120
But you add a little bit
Of force to that,

07:02.122 --> 07:04.790
And sudden they intertwine,
Tangling together,

07:04.792 --> 07:06.925
And that makes them
Act like a solid,

07:06.927 --> 07:08.126
Just for a moment, though.

07:08.128 --> 07:09.828
You remove that force,

07:09.830 --> 07:13.265
Back to liquid.

07:18.572 --> 07:20.705
And to demonstrate how
These physical properties.

07:20.707 --> 07:25.010
Might prove to be bombproof,

07:25.012 --> 07:27.612
Brian and jon begin
With impact testing.

07:27.614 --> 07:30.282
3, 2, 1...

07:41.094 --> 07:45.263
A perfect example
Of a newtonian fluid,

07:45.265 --> 07:49.768
Consistent viscosity
All the way through.

07:49.770 --> 07:51.536
Good. Let's move on.

07:51.538 --> 07:53.338
Next up, the oobleck.

07:53.340 --> 07:56.575
How will the nonnewtonian
Fluid react to the impact?

07:56.577 --> 08:00.145
In 3, 2, 1...

08:03.717 --> 08:05.750
that's great.

08:05.752 --> 08:09.321
It just kind of went...

08:13.961 --> 08:15.660
That was an interesting test.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.898
The bearing comes flying in,
Hits the surface of the oobleck,

08:19.900 --> 08:23.435
Then it sinks in only to be
Flung right back out,

08:23.437 --> 08:29.040
Hesitate for a moment before
Disappearing into obscurity.

08:29.042 --> 08:31.576
If the ball had been
Dropped on a human head,

08:31.578 --> 08:36.847
It would have had an impact
Force of 3,140 pounds.

08:36.850 --> 08:41.119
The oobleck reduced
That to 640 pounds,

08:41.121 --> 08:45.490
A promising demonstration of
Its impactabsorbing qualities.

08:45.492 --> 08:46.625
Bring on the bombs.

08:48.729 --> 08:54.533
A quarter, 22 and 1/4.

08:54.535 --> 08:56.167
How are we gonna test
On a small scale.

08:56.169 --> 09:00.839
If oobleck is bombproof?

09:00.841 --> 09:02.340
With glass panels.

09:07.681 --> 09:10.248
There's five glass panels
Here, and each one takes about

09:10.250 --> 09:12.484
1 p.S.I. To break.

09:12.486 --> 09:15.353
Our cherry bomb explodes,
Sending that pressure wave up.

09:15.355 --> 09:17.389
Through air, water, or oobleck,

09:17.391 --> 09:20.458
So we can test
All three media...

09:20.460 --> 09:21.893
This is awesome.

09:21.895 --> 09:24.696
And then we can determine
How much is broken by each media.

09:24.698 --> 09:29.034
And if there is a significant
Reduction in that pressure wave.

09:29.036 --> 09:30.969
So test one is a control.

09:30.971 --> 09:34.039
A bag of air is sandwiched
Between the cherry bomb.

09:34.041 --> 09:36.608
And glass panels.

09:36.610 --> 09:40.712
1 1/2 ounce cherry bomb
Pressure test with air.

09:40.714 --> 09:43.982
In 3, 2, 1...

09:46.787 --> 09:48.053
That's what I call a benchmark.

09:55.262 --> 09:56.761
Three.

09:56.763 --> 09:57.762
The mythbusters are
Testing the internet fable...

09:57.764 --> 10:03.034
2, 1...

10:03.036 --> 10:04.402
That a nonnewtonian fluid...

10:04.404 --> 10:08.907
- one.
- Is bombproof.

10:08.909 --> 10:13.945
The booms began with a control
An airfilled bag.

10:13.947 --> 10:15.413
1...

10:19.753 --> 10:22.020
That test is exactly
What we were looking for.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.122
It looked like shattered glass
Everywhere to us,

10:24.124 --> 10:25.924
But the highspeed revealed
The secrets,

10:25.926 --> 10:28.460
The pressure wave...
Boom. Boom. Boom.

10:28.462 --> 10:31.396
First three panes of glass gone.
Fourth one gives.

10:31.398 --> 10:33.632
The fifth looks like
It's not going to.

10:33.634 --> 10:35.934
The pressure wave's
Almost done, but, boom,

10:35.936 --> 10:38.003
The glass cracks,

10:38.005 --> 10:39.671
And that's exactly
Where we want to be.

10:39.673 --> 10:41.473
To compare water and oobleck to.

10:44.945 --> 10:47.145
Next up, a bag of water
Comparable in size.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.980
To our bag of air.

10:48.982 --> 10:50.849
- Hot!
- All right. Here we go.

10:50.851 --> 10:54.252
1 1/2 ounce cherry bomb
Pressure test with water.

10:54.254 --> 10:57.756
In three, two, one...

11:00.460 --> 11:01.700
I'll never get tired of that.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.565
Using air as our barrier,
The cherry bomb.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.067
Blew up five panes of glass.

11:09.069 --> 11:11.970
With water, three panes.

11:11.972 --> 11:13.271
Next up is oobleck.

11:13.273 --> 11:17.375
We'll see how that compares
To the other two.

11:17.377 --> 11:20.679
Just suck it in. Suck it in.

11:20.681 --> 11:23.248
You're being a real jerk,
You know that?

11:30.557 --> 11:32.991
All right. The moment we've
All been waiting for.

11:32.993 --> 11:36.361
1 1/2 ounce cherry bomb
Pressure test with oobleck.

11:36.363 --> 11:39.631
In three, two, one...

11:43.603 --> 11:45.123
It went off like boom,
And even went...

11:53.346 --> 11:55.980
One...

11:58.618 --> 12:00.752
Ho!

12:00.754 --> 12:02.087
Okay, look at that.

12:02.089 --> 12:03.621
The explosion goes off
And the oobleck.

12:03.623 --> 12:05.023
Actually looks
Like it tightens up.

12:05.025 --> 12:08.660
And just goes as a wall like...

12:08.662 --> 12:10.795
these were definitely
Interesting results.

12:10.797 --> 12:13.498
Oobleck was significantly
Better than air,

12:13.500 --> 12:15.233
And water broke three panes.

12:15.235 --> 12:17.302
With the oobleck, only two.

12:17.304 --> 12:21.639
I'm beginning to think there
Might be something to this myth.

12:21.641 --> 12:24.109
The mythical goo compares
Well to water,

12:24.111 --> 12:26.377
But a cherry bomb's
Just not gonna cut it.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.847
I mean, it's a bomb,
As is in cherry bomb,

12:28.849 --> 12:32.350
But to test this myth
For real, we got to go big.

12:32.352 --> 12:35.620
Next step...
High explosives, baby.

12:35.622 --> 12:39.290
But before the team
Decamp to a deserted destination.

12:39.292 --> 12:42.627
For a date with detonation,

12:42.629 --> 12:44.462
It's back to
The bodydouble movie myth.

12:49.669 --> 12:52.036
Time to get to the pointy
End of this myth.

12:52.038 --> 12:55.640
Right in the middle. Perfect.

12:55.642 --> 12:57.709
We need to know whether or not
You can you hold up a human body.

12:57.711 --> 13:00.779
And use it as body armor.

13:00.781 --> 13:01.946
Now we have the syndaver...

13:03.350 --> 13:05.583
And it is a perfect
Human replica,

13:05.585 --> 13:09.254
But it's a little bit expensive
To determine penetration depth.

13:09.256 --> 13:12.991
God, That's stuff's beautiful.

13:12.993 --> 13:14.926
So before we shoot
Into the syndaver,

13:14.928 --> 13:16.761
We're gonna be shooting
Into our good old friend,

13:16.763 --> 13:18.196
Ballistics gel,

13:18.198 --> 13:21.199
Just so we can get some data
On guns and ammunition.

13:21.201 --> 13:23.268
- Bing!
- All right.

13:23.270 --> 13:25.170
We could have gone with
A range of weapons.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.905
- Boom!
- Good.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.106
Instead, we have done
With the 9mil,

13:28.108 --> 13:29.541
Fullsized handgun.

13:29.543 --> 13:32.310
The reason being it's in
Just about every action movie,

13:32.312 --> 13:36.815
Every tv show, and that
Makes it our weapon of choice.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.583
- All right.
- Looks good to me.

13:38.585 --> 13:40.485
What kind of ammunition
Will we be shooting.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.986
Into our ballistics gel?

13:41.988 --> 13:44.622
Well, here we have three
Different 9millimeter rounds.

13:44.624 --> 13:46.991
We have a full metal jacket.

13:46.993 --> 13:50.161
We have a standardissue
Police hollow point,

13:50.163 --> 13:52.997
And we have a selfdefense
Hollow point.

13:52.999 --> 13:56.301
Now realistically in a gunfight,
You want to use these two,

13:56.303 --> 13:57.869
'cause they're meant
To dump all their energy.

13:57.871 --> 13:59.270
Inside their initial target.

13:59.272 --> 14:02.607
Without causing horrific
Collateral damage.

14:02.609 --> 14:04.943
Yep, and first up,
The selfdefense hollow point.

14:04.945 --> 14:07.946
- Round one, locked and loaded.
- Great.

14:07.948 --> 14:09.514
It's designed to
Fragment upon impact,

14:09.516 --> 14:11.416
Reducing the chance of
The bullet.

14:11.418 --> 14:12.984
Passing through the gel.

14:12.986 --> 14:18.022
Defensiveround hollow point
Firing in three, two, one...

14:23.029 --> 14:24.729
- Look at that.
- It's beautiful.

14:24.731 --> 14:28.333
It just dispersed.

14:28.335 --> 14:29.567
Looking at the test of.

14:29.569 --> 14:32.203
The defensive Hollowpoint round,

14:32.205 --> 14:34.405
You'll see that channel
Open up very wide.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.241
That's because all energy
Is being left.

14:36.243 --> 14:37.842
Right here at this end.

14:37.844 --> 14:40.411
This one little bit, by the time
It reaches right there,

14:40.413 --> 14:42.881
Has very little energy
And speed left,

14:42.883 --> 14:44.482
And I wouldn't be
Too worried about it.

14:44.484 --> 14:45.884
This is where I don't wanna be.

14:45.886 --> 14:48.853
I would be very happy
Being over here.

14:48.855 --> 14:50.555
With most of
The energy dispersed.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.223
Within the first few inches,

14:52.225 --> 14:55.326
That's a promising
Result for the myth.

14:55.328 --> 14:57.662
If boomer takes
A bullet that well,

14:57.664 --> 15:01.099
A good guy holding
Him up may be saved.

15:01.101 --> 15:02.867
Cue test two.

15:02.869 --> 15:08.840
Standardissue police
Hollow point in three, two, one.

15:11.845 --> 15:15.880
That one had some kick to it.

15:15.882 --> 15:17.415
- Wow.
- That's beautiful.

15:17.417 --> 15:19.550
It's pulled back,
Released some of its energy,

15:19.552 --> 15:22.020
But made it all the way through.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.388
I wouldn't want to be
Behind that.

15:23.390 --> 15:24.856
Not this time.

15:27.694 --> 15:29.060
Yeah.

15:29.062 --> 15:30.395
That's a lot more damage.

15:30.397 --> 15:32.964
I mean, it's that
Extra mass, that extra energy.

15:32.966 --> 15:34.933
You just look at it.
You got cavitation at the front.

15:34.935 --> 15:36.334
You got cavitation at the back.

15:36.336 --> 15:39.604
There's just damage everywhere.

15:39.606 --> 15:44.709
Full metal jacket, final test.

15:44.711 --> 15:47.578
My prediction... beautiful,
High speed, ugly result.

15:47.580 --> 15:49.113
With its hard outer casing,

15:49.115 --> 15:50.548
This round is the least.

15:50.550 --> 15:53.051
Likely to break up
In the ballistics gel.

16:10.003 --> 16:11.970
Yeah. Worsecasescenario
Round right there.

16:11.972 --> 16:13.538
I feel like he's dead.

16:13.540 --> 16:17.709
The guy behind him's dead,
And the guy behind him's dead.

16:17.711 --> 16:19.911
I just saw something that our
Highspeed cameras caught that

16:19.913 --> 16:22.647
I really wanna share with you.

16:22.649 --> 16:25.817
Ooh! Huge cavitation,

16:25.819 --> 16:27.685
And you see That flash of light?

16:27.687 --> 16:29.921
That's what we call
Sonoluminescence,

16:29.923 --> 16:33.458
And we've only seen it
At this kind of speed.

16:33.460 --> 16:36.461
It happens when a cavitation
Closes itself so fast.

16:36.463 --> 16:41.232
That it created plasma upwards
Of 3,600 degrees fahrenheit.

16:41.234 --> 16:43.034
That is pretty dope.

16:52.078 --> 16:54.145
Later on "Mythbusters"...

16:54.147 --> 16:56.080
ho, yeah!

16:56.082 --> 16:57.648
Both ballistic mysteries.

16:57.650 --> 16:59.951
Hit deserted Desert locations...

16:59.953 --> 17:02.487
Just getting dressed
As a hit man.

17:02.489 --> 17:04.821
For fullscale mayhem.

17:04.824 --> 17:05.890
My goodness.

17:22.776 --> 17:24.041
Where are we at?

17:24.044 --> 17:25.309
Well, the movies
Would have us believe.

17:25.310 --> 17:26.810
That you can totally
Pick up a dead body.

17:26.813 --> 17:29.213
And carry it around
As a bulletproof shield.

17:29.215 --> 17:33.418
Now we know you can carry
A body, but is it bulletproof?

17:33.420 --> 17:36.287
So up next we're gonna get
Our super accurate human analog.

17:36.289 --> 17:39.157
Syndaver, shoot it,
And find out.

17:40.693 --> 17:42.727
Obviously we can't be carrying
This dead body around ourselves,

17:42.729 --> 17:45.463
And I don't think they'll let us
Use interns for this one,

17:45.465 --> 17:47.231
So that means we have
A big build ahead.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.201
We have to build a sliding cart
To hold the syndaver,

17:50.203 --> 17:52.670
A good guy standin
To hold him up.

17:52.672 --> 17:56.374
We need a pulley and motor
To move it back and forth,

17:56.376 --> 18:00.878
And we need a returnfire
Paintball rig for added realism.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.213
Hey, bo.

18:02.215 --> 18:03.448
It's about to get noisy.

18:07.587 --> 18:09.821
To take this hollywood tall tale.

18:09.823 --> 18:14.258
And test it with live ammo...

18:14.260 --> 18:15.626
Is that the sound
Of the blade breaking?

18:15.628 --> 18:16.661
- No.
- Yeah.

18:16.663 --> 18:18.830
I'd recognize that
Sound anywhere.

18:18.832 --> 18:23.201
Requires a complex setup.

18:23.203 --> 18:24.535
Hoho.

18:24.537 --> 18:26.137
John will build A track and cart.

18:26.139 --> 18:27.905
To carry the cadaver...

18:27.907 --> 18:29.073
Go, go, go, go, go.

18:29.075 --> 18:31.442
That's incredibly easy.
That's awesome.

18:34.614 --> 18:37.515
While brian Provides the power.

18:37.517 --> 18:39.016
The cart we're gonna
Build for this rig,

18:39.018 --> 18:40.718
It's gonna be
A little bit heavy with that.

18:40.720 --> 18:44.122
Syndaver on it,
All its parts nice and beefy,

18:44.124 --> 18:45.456
So we went with a tool.

18:45.458 --> 18:48.292
We already had in the shop,
Has lots of torque,

18:48.294 --> 18:51.662
Got a big gearbox on it,
A reversible motor.

18:51.664 --> 18:54.932
Green wire first. Ooh.
No boom. We're good. All right.

18:54.934 --> 18:56.901
And with just a little bit
Of tweaking.

18:56.903 --> 18:58.402
We can control
The speed on it...

18:58.404 --> 19:00.171
The proper technique
Is to use your teeth,

19:00.173 --> 19:01.472
But I wanna avoid that.

19:01.474 --> 19:05.009
And it'll get that cart
Back and forth.

19:06.112 --> 19:10.815
All right. That's the ticket.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.383
Perfect.

19:12.385 --> 19:15.720
What was a power tool is now our
Precisioncontrolled, accurate,

19:15.722 --> 19:18.022
Reversible winch motor.

19:18.024 --> 19:20.491
We wired it up
To a speed controller.

19:20.493 --> 19:21.926
And to a reverse switch.

19:21.928 --> 19:25.363
To allow us to move that rig
Backwards and forwards.

19:25.365 --> 19:27.665
This is just one of
Seven rail platforms.

19:27.667 --> 19:30.001
That our dolly
Will be gliding across.

19:32.205 --> 19:35.640
That should definitely be
Strong enough to hold syndaver.

19:35.642 --> 19:36.774
And the good guy.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.142
So smooth.

19:38.144 --> 19:42.079
It will be really smooth picking
Up those women at the bar.

19:42.081 --> 19:43.314
With, like, 70 feet of track.
That's right.

19:43.316 --> 19:45.750
Hey, ladies.
Want to hop on this dolly?

19:45.752 --> 19:47.451
You're being shot at.
Pew, pew. Pew.

19:47.453 --> 19:51.189
Pew. Pew, pew, pew.
Pew, pew, pew.

19:51.191 --> 19:53.758
- That's incredibly smooth.
- Yeah, I know.

19:53.760 --> 19:55.493
- Let's shoot at it.
- Yeah.

19:58.264 --> 20:00.164
Next up, John preps the good guy.

20:00.166 --> 20:02.767
Who will be holding up
The dead guy.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.335
Human anatomy.

20:04.337 --> 20:06.837
Huge forearms.

20:06.839 --> 20:09.040
What I'm working on right now
Is the plywood cutout.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.108
That sits behind the syndaver,

20:11.110 --> 20:13.344
So we know that if the bullets
Do happen to go through,

20:13.346 --> 20:14.779
If they don't make it
Into the plywood,

20:14.781 --> 20:16.280
Then we don't
Count them as lethal.

20:16.282 --> 20:18.683
Heroic proportions.

20:18.685 --> 20:21.352
Yeah.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.486
Heroic legs.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.264
And finally to give the shooter.

20:33.266 --> 20:36.000
A taste of actionmovie
Authenticity,

20:36.002 --> 20:39.704
Brian rigs a remotecontrolled
Return fire system.

20:39.706 --> 20:41.372
For the plywood good guy.

20:50.216 --> 20:54.218
Deadliest use of
A wiper motor ever.

20:54.220 --> 20:56.587
Coming up on goo gone wild...

20:56.589 --> 20:57.989
Wow, we're really good at this.

20:57.991 --> 20:59.824
If this doesn't work out,
We can go to clown school.

20:59.826 --> 21:03.361
The tnt party
Ramps up with a countdown.

21:03.363 --> 21:06.297
In three, two, one...

21:14.674 --> 21:16.040
Is the mysterious material,

21:16.042 --> 21:18.643
Oobleck...

21:19.946 --> 21:24.815
Really bombproof?

21:24.817 --> 21:32.817
To investigate, jon and brian
Have hit the desert,

21:33.259 --> 21:36.794
The perfect location
To cause a commotion.

21:36.796 --> 21:39.830
We're here at caravan west
Ranch and this is a beautiful,

21:39.832 --> 21:41.198
Isolated spot,

21:41.200 --> 21:44.669
Exactly what we need
For some explosions.

21:44.671 --> 21:48.105
This is custommade for a boom.

21:48.107 --> 21:49.540
So where are we at?

21:49.542 --> 21:51.142
Well, we played with oobleck
Back in the shop.

21:51.144 --> 21:56.080
To see its
Nonnewtonian properties,

21:56.082 --> 21:58.716
Then we put that oobleck to
The test against air and water,

21:58.718 --> 22:03.087
And it actually seems to reduce
Some of that blast force,

22:03.089 --> 22:05.289
But now it's time to put it
To the ultimate test.

22:05.291 --> 22:07.325
In a highspeed explosive.

22:07.327 --> 22:09.660
To see if oobleck
Is actually bombproof.

22:09.662 --> 22:12.730
The blast point.

22:12.732 --> 22:14.098
For the first time
On "Mythbusters".

22:14.100 --> 22:16.100
We're gonna be using
A combination of nitromethane.

22:16.102 --> 22:18.069
And aluminum powder.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.370
Yeah.

22:19.372 --> 22:21.272
It's a twopart explosive
Used for demolition,

22:21.274 --> 22:22.640
And when you combine those two,

22:22.642 --> 22:25.643
You get a blast over
21,000 feet per second.

22:25.645 --> 22:28.245
That is one heck
Of a high explosive.

22:28.247 --> 22:30.281
- Pressure sensor.
- In the pipe.

22:30.283 --> 22:32.450
Well, we want to get
The best data for our blast,

22:32.452 --> 22:34.919
And to do that, we're gonna
Use these pressure sensors.

22:34.921 --> 22:37.154
- Brian!
- I can't hear you.

22:37.156 --> 22:38.222
Hot!

22:38.224 --> 22:39.757
I'm getting pulled over.

22:39.759 --> 22:41.759
How is it looking?

22:41.761 --> 22:43.894
I don't know. It's a dark pipe.

22:43.896 --> 22:46.397
Sensitive from all the way
In the microp.S.I. Range.

22:46.399 --> 22:48.966
All the way to 5,000 p.S.I.,

22:48.968 --> 22:52.203
But the cable itself needs to
Be protected from the blast.

22:52.205 --> 22:54.538
One more.

22:54.540 --> 22:56.707
A little flat.
Can you go sharp on it?

22:58.478 --> 22:59.944
We're gonna bury these sensors,

22:59.946 --> 23:02.780
Run the cable through a pipe
Laid in the trench behind us.

23:02.782 --> 23:03.914
Hey, brian, Wanna see a trick?

23:03.916 --> 23:07.251
- Yeah.
- Here we go.

23:07.253 --> 23:10.187
- Come on.
- There it is.

23:10.189 --> 23:11.756
- Bravo.
- Whoo!

23:11.758 --> 23:13.491
Let's drop her in.

23:13.493 --> 23:15.426
That's the expensive, Sensitive,

23:15.428 --> 23:19.296
Electronic instrumentation,

23:19.298 --> 23:23.734
And these are analog pressure
Senses or water balloons.

23:32.245 --> 23:33.511
Tuck it in.

23:33.513 --> 23:34.912
So how is this gonna work?

23:34.914 --> 23:37.381
We have a 4foot by 4foot by
4inch aquarium.

23:37.383 --> 23:38.649
We're gonna fill
With our medium.

23:38.651 --> 23:40.017
There we go.

23:40.019 --> 23:42.052
For the first test, That's air.

23:42.054 --> 23:43.721
Perfect.

23:43.723 --> 23:46.624
Then, we're gonna place 3 pounds
Of our binary explosive here,

23:46.626 --> 23:48.159
1 foot away from it.

23:48.161 --> 23:51.395
And these pressure transducers,
6foot away from our blast,

23:51.397 --> 23:52.830
Will give us readings
On what kind of.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.765
Pressure wave Moves through here.

23:54.767 --> 23:57.101
After it travels through
Our empty aquarium.

23:57.103 --> 23:58.569
And in addition to that data,

23:58.571 --> 24:01.172
We have an analog
Explosion detector.

24:01.174 --> 24:02.973
With these waterfilled Balloons,

24:02.975 --> 24:05.876
And we'll see how many pop
After each different explosion.

24:05.878 --> 24:06.911
All right. We're all set up.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.679
Air test here we come.

24:20.626 --> 24:22.760
- Ready?
- I'm ready.

24:22.762 --> 24:24.228
Here we go.

24:24.230 --> 24:28.332
Fullscale blast pressure test
With empty aquarium in

24:28.334 --> 24:32.503
3, 2, 1...

24:38.344 --> 24:39.944
I don't see any balloons...

24:42.815 --> 24:46.784
Or the aquarium...

24:46.786 --> 24:49.286
Or the bottom Half of the rig.

24:49.288 --> 24:50.488
It's gone.

24:55.094 --> 24:58.028
Well, air doesn't
Block an explosion.

24:58.030 --> 25:00.397
Tada!

25:00.399 --> 25:02.900
Well, that was eventful.

25:02.902 --> 25:06.070
Yeah, looks like the pressure
Transducer survived.

25:06.072 --> 25:07.438
This, not so much.

25:07.440 --> 25:09.440
That was 3 pounds
Of high explosive,

25:09.442 --> 25:15.079
And most of our stuff is gone,
Like a magic trick.

25:16.682 --> 25:19.550
Hey, little man, You make it?

25:19.552 --> 25:21.218
The empty aquarium
Did pretty much.

25:21.220 --> 25:23.621
Nothing to stop That shockwave.

25:23.623 --> 25:25.089
Look at that.

25:25.091 --> 25:26.357
You can see the explosion,

25:26.359 --> 25:28.359
Then you see the shockwave
Going in front of it.

25:28.361 --> 25:31.929
And it's the shockwave
That pops the balloons.

25:31.931 --> 25:34.331
- That's fantastic.
- That's so beautiful.

25:34.333 --> 25:37.768
And then all the shrapnel hits.

25:37.770 --> 25:41.105
Thanks to our pressure sensor
On the floor, it read 46 p.S.I.

25:41.107 --> 25:43.173
6 feet away
From our empty aquarium.

25:43.175 --> 25:45.476
Remember, our threshold
For oobleck being bombproof.

25:45.478 --> 25:46.911
Is that it reduces
The pressure wave.

25:46.913 --> 25:51.849
To 10 p.S.I. Or lower.

25:53.319 --> 25:55.886
But first, a second
Control to compare to oobleck.

25:55.888 --> 25:57.555
And the air, water...

25:57.557 --> 25:58.689
Is it bowing on the bottom?

25:58.691 --> 26:00.424
It's bowing like crazy.

26:00.426 --> 26:02.660
A conventional Newtonian fluid.

26:02.662 --> 26:05.663
That's a little heavier
Than the rig would like.

26:05.665 --> 26:09.033
That's... brian!

26:09.035 --> 26:10.668
Look at it.

26:10.670 --> 26:13.137
My god.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.439
I don't know if it's
Going to make it.

26:15.441 --> 26:18.208
The aquarium acquiesced barely,

26:18.210 --> 26:20.177
And the race is on to blow it up.

26:20.179 --> 26:22.346
Before it collapses
Under its own weight.

26:28.487 --> 26:29.920
- Ready?
- Ready.

26:29.922 --> 26:34.258
Fullscale blast pressure test
With aquarium full of water.

26:34.260 --> 26:37.728
In 3, 2, 1...

26:41.067 --> 26:42.967
That was massive, but look.

26:42.969 --> 26:46.670
The wall is still one piece.

26:46.672 --> 26:50.240
Unlike the air test,
The waterballoon wall.

26:50.242 --> 26:53.344
Is indeed still standing.

26:53.346 --> 26:55.813
Look at that.

26:55.815 --> 26:57.881
Yeah, it's significantly
Less damage.

26:57.883 --> 27:00.951
The legs are still intact.
The wall is still up.

27:00.953 --> 27:03.587
The sensor reading from
The empty aquarium 6 feet away.

27:03.589 --> 27:08.158
Was 46 p.S.I.

27:08.160 --> 27:14.031
The aquarium full of water
At 6 feet away 36 p.S.I.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.532
That was beautiful highspeed.

27:15.534 --> 27:17.234
The blast goes off.

27:17.236 --> 27:18.869
We see that shockwave
Pass through,

27:18.871 --> 27:21.105
Destroying most of the balloons.

27:21.107 --> 27:26.810
After that, debris pretty much
Finished off everything.

27:26.812 --> 27:29.613
It was definitely less severe
Than the airfilled aquarium,

27:29.615 --> 27:33.117
But I wouldn't wanna
Be standing out there.

27:33.119 --> 27:36.854
Yep, the pressure wave
And resultant damage.

27:36.856 --> 27:40.924
Was dispersed
By the waterfilled barrier,

27:40.926 --> 27:46.230
But at 36 p.S.I.,
It's still lethal,

27:46.232 --> 27:47.731
But the big question is,

27:47.733 --> 27:49.967
Will the oobleck block
That blast.

27:49.969 --> 27:51.635
And prove to be bombproof?

28:01.814 --> 28:04.948
Largest latte.

28:04.950 --> 28:09.186
Ooh, yeah!

28:09.188 --> 28:11.288
Brian and jon are on a mission.

28:13.626 --> 28:16.293
Will oobleck,
A nonnewtonian liquid.

28:16.295 --> 28:19.196
That solidifies upon
The application of force,

28:19.198 --> 28:22.466
Prove to be bombproof.

28:22.468 --> 28:25.569
At 6 feet away with just air,

28:25.571 --> 28:27.171
46 p.S.I.

28:27.173 --> 28:30.441
With water, 36 p.S.I.,

28:30.443 --> 28:33.310
And that's a newtonian fluid.

28:33.312 --> 28:35.379
That right there is oobleck,
Nonnewtonian,

28:35.381 --> 28:38.382
So I feel like we're gonna
Drop down to, like,

28:38.384 --> 28:40.551
20 p.S.I.

28:40.553 --> 28:41.585
All right.

28:41.587 --> 28:43.721
We got oobleck in here
And on here.

28:43.723 --> 28:46.690
Bomb goes there.
Pressure sensors are good.

28:46.692 --> 28:49.126
- Let's hit the go button.
- Let's do it.

28:49.128 --> 28:51.895
Oobleck, bombproof?
I've got high hopes.

29:01.874 --> 29:04.608
All right. You ready?

29:04.610 --> 29:06.510
- Ready.
- Okay.

29:06.512 --> 29:09.246
He's the final test.

29:09.248 --> 29:14.985
Oobleck bombproof test
In 3, 2, 1...

29:17.490 --> 29:19.957
hey!

29:19.959 --> 29:21.158
That's cool.

29:21.160 --> 29:23.060
The wall is literally
Running with oobleck.

29:23.062 --> 29:24.361
Yeah.

29:24.363 --> 29:26.463
In terms of damage from here,
It looks comparable,

29:26.465 --> 29:27.664
If not better to water.

29:30.970 --> 29:35.539
The binary high
Explosive does its thing.

29:35.541 --> 29:38.242
The blast is a concussive...

29:38.244 --> 29:40.811
Eruptive...

29:40.813 --> 29:42.980
Terrifying...

29:42.982 --> 29:46.950
21,000 feet per second.

29:46.952 --> 29:48.485
Man, look at this.

29:48.487 --> 29:51.622
There is a clear radius
Of where there's no oobleck,

29:51.624 --> 29:54.658
And then there's just
Oobleck all around.

29:54.660 --> 29:58.228
- Is it still oobleck?
- I don't know.

29:58.230 --> 30:02.132
Ooh, it got dried out
By the explosion.

30:02.134 --> 30:05.936
That highspeed footage
Was amazing.

30:05.938 --> 30:08.772
It sends a shockwave blowing up
Most of these balloons,

30:08.774 --> 30:11.708
But then it almost seems like
There's an invisible wall.

30:11.710 --> 30:14.578
Holding back this
Massive fireball,

30:14.580 --> 30:17.748
And then out of nowhere,
Slowly, a tidal wave of oobleck.

30:17.750 --> 30:21.819
Comes showering back
Towards the board and...

30:21.821 --> 30:27.124
Covers it.

30:27.126 --> 30:28.692
Still rolling. You made it.

30:28.694 --> 30:31.428
Whoo!

30:31.430 --> 30:32.896
The fireball And shrapnel.

30:32.898 --> 30:35.399
Do seem to have been deflected,

30:35.401 --> 30:38.335
But what about that organ
Damaging pressure wave?

30:38.337 --> 30:42.105
Did the nonnewtonian liquid
Turn solid and absorb.

30:42.107 --> 30:44.741
Or reflect that force?

30:44.743 --> 30:47.311
And now, the moment we've
All we've been waiting for...

30:47.313 --> 30:49.479
The data.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.549
The explosion on the 6foot
Sensor through air.

30:52.551 --> 30:55.419
Is at 46 p.S.I.,

30:55.421 --> 30:57.855
Through water 36 p.S.I.,

30:57.857 --> 31:01.225
For our oobleck,

31:01.227 --> 31:03.827
51 p.S.I.

31:03.829 --> 31:05.562
That's incredible.

31:05.564 --> 31:08.765
It's higher. Why?

31:08.767 --> 31:10.667
Well, when the oobleck's hit
By the pressure wave,

31:10.669 --> 31:13.704
It turns temporarily
Into a solid.

31:13.706 --> 31:16.006
That densely packed media
Doesn't deflect or absorb.

31:16.008 --> 31:18.809
The energy as you might think.

31:18.811 --> 31:21.378
It actually transfers
The energy more efficiently,

31:21.380 --> 31:23.714
Like sound traveling
Faster through water.

31:23.716 --> 31:27.351
That is a really cool result.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.953
So we know that cornstarch
Is great for gravy,

31:29.955 --> 31:31.421
But is it bombproof?

31:31.423 --> 31:32.723
Heck no, man. Look around you.

31:32.725 --> 31:34.324
This place is a disaster.

31:34.326 --> 31:36.460
- So busted?
- Busted.

32:02.254 --> 32:04.221
We're here at combat paintball.

32:04.223 --> 32:08.191
Just outside of santa clarita
In southern california.

32:08.193 --> 32:09.826
This is a pretty awesome spot.

32:09.828 --> 32:12.596
Yeah, it's the perfect
Place for a firefight.

32:12.598 --> 32:14.264
We're here testing can you
Pick up an enemy body.

32:14.266 --> 32:15.532
During a firefight,

32:15.534 --> 32:18.101
Can that body protect you
From oncoming bullets?

32:18.103 --> 32:19.603
We're gonna set up
Or rig out there.

32:19.605 --> 32:22.506
And test this myth for real.

32:22.508 --> 32:25.742
It's like we're unloading
This giant bomb disposal robot.

32:25.744 --> 32:27.277
Go, robot, go.

32:27.279 --> 32:28.946
Yes!

32:33.452 --> 32:35.285
Ooh. Very nice.

32:39.558 --> 32:42.592
We're okay.

32:42.594 --> 32:44.761
Solid. Not even a creak.

32:44.763 --> 32:45.996
The way we have
This track set up,

32:45.998 --> 32:48.332
It might seem a little
Wibbly wobbly...

32:48.334 --> 32:49.833
Onward, john! Onward!

32:49.835 --> 32:52.169
But we designed
Our dolly so well.

32:52.171 --> 32:55.339
That it tracks perfectly smooth
Over the entire 50 feet.

32:55.341 --> 32:57.374
So light, like a feather.

32:57.376 --> 32:58.742
Damn you, gravity.

32:58.744 --> 33:01.645
So one jonpowered race car.

33:03.949 --> 33:05.349
This is nice.

33:05.351 --> 33:06.950
The next thing we have to
Do is set the pulley.

33:06.952 --> 33:08.518
To get it up and down range.

33:08.520 --> 33:09.886
Drop this in.

33:09.888 --> 33:12.456
It's kind of Like a tie fighter.

33:12.458 --> 33:13.690
So why all the field work.

33:13.692 --> 33:15.759
Putting this hefty box
Around our motor?

33:15.761 --> 33:17.594
Well, there's a couple things
We need to worry about.

33:17.596 --> 33:19.429
The first is small arms fire.

33:19.431 --> 33:21.498
Our bullets are coming
Right at the rig.

33:21.500 --> 33:25.635
This wall's gonna help
Protect that nice motor.

33:25.637 --> 33:29.106
The other is, that's a long
Track with a heavy cart on it.

33:29.108 --> 33:31.942
There we go.
That won't go nowhere.

33:31.944 --> 33:35.245
We got forces wanting to pull
This over towards the cart

33:35.247 --> 33:40.350
'cause it's pulling on the cart.

33:40.352 --> 33:43.920
The last thing is
The height of the pulley.

33:43.922 --> 33:45.722
- It's in.
- It's in.

33:45.724 --> 33:46.757
The rope under the cart is only.

33:46.759 --> 33:48.759
A couple inches off the ground.

33:48.761 --> 33:50.127
Stop! You good.

33:50.129 --> 33:52.095
So we need about 6 inches
Of clearance,

33:52.097 --> 33:54.898
And this gets us right
Where we need to be.

33:54.900 --> 33:56.199
Which way do you want to go?

33:56.201 --> 33:57.200
This way or that way?

33:57.202 --> 33:58.935
I think that away.

33:58.937 --> 34:00.337
Is that way actually that way?

34:00.339 --> 34:02.906
I don't know which is...

34:02.908 --> 34:05.175
That's why it says
This way or that way.

34:05.177 --> 34:08.178
In three, two, one...

34:11.917 --> 34:14.217
yeah!

34:14.219 --> 34:17.254
With the pulley system
Pulling this way and that...

34:17.255 --> 34:19.856
That's it.

34:19.858 --> 34:22.359
And the cherry on top.

34:22.360 --> 34:23.460
The random returnfire.

34:23.462 --> 34:26.963
Paintball gun is added...

34:26.965 --> 34:29.132
- that should spray us.
- That'll do.

34:29.134 --> 34:34.071
And set up to fire remotely.

34:34.072 --> 34:38.141
See that smug look on my face.
That's some sexy stuff.

34:38.143 --> 34:40.811
Cue our 2d good guy.

34:40.813 --> 34:44.347
Looks like he's fully armed.

34:44.349 --> 34:46.248
Are those muscles?
Is that what that is?

34:46.251 --> 34:48.217
He either padded himself out
By stuffing his shirt.

34:48.219 --> 34:51.822
With his socks Or he's jacked.

34:51.824 --> 34:53.556
- Good.
- Good?

34:53.559 --> 34:54.791
Yeah.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.927
They're all set
For a systems check.

34:56.929 --> 35:00.797
Just getting dressed
As a hit man.

35:00.799 --> 35:03.600
Later, they'll be
Graduating to live rounds.

35:03.602 --> 35:04.801
And adding the syndaver.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.970
To see if he protects
The good guy,

35:06.972 --> 35:10.841
But for now, they're just
Making sure everything works.

35:10.843 --> 35:14.077
All right, brian. You ready?

35:14.079 --> 35:16.079
Ready!

35:16.081 --> 35:22.018
Paintball shooting with return
Paintball fire in 3, 2, 1...

35:31.330 --> 35:34.331
Whoa!

35:34.333 --> 35:36.266
Have I hit you yet, brian?

35:36.268 --> 35:37.934
- It's kind of scary.
- He's shooting.

35:37.936 --> 35:42.772
I mean, I'm lighting you up.
I shooting the gun.

35:42.774 --> 35:45.442
It looks like
He's getting close.

35:45.444 --> 35:47.344
Did that...! Holy moly!

35:47.346 --> 35:48.879
I almost shot myself.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.113
My goodness.

35:50.115 --> 35:52.315
That's some real wild fire
Right there.

35:59.057 --> 36:00.290
I'm not gonna lie.

36:00.292 --> 36:02.526
I really have no idea
When it's coming at me,

36:02.528 --> 36:04.294
And it is actually
Kind of terrifying.

36:04.296 --> 36:07.063
Every time that thing fires.

36:07.065 --> 36:10.500
My goodness.

36:10.502 --> 36:11.935
That's pretty fun.

36:11.937 --> 36:15.205
That was, but it's time
For real guns and real bullets.

36:15.207 --> 36:16.239
Want to make a competition
Out of it?

36:16.241 --> 36:17.274
Yeah.

36:29.454 --> 36:31.821
So where are we with
The myth right now?

36:31.823 --> 36:34.224
We've done some paintball test
Shooting at a moving dolly.

36:34.226 --> 36:37.194
With it firing back at us,

36:37.196 --> 36:41.097
But now it's time to up
The ante... live ammunition.

36:41.099 --> 36:42.732
Yeah.

36:42.734 --> 36:44.034
One magazine, 10 rounds total.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.469
Lock and load
At your discretion.

36:46.471 --> 36:48.071
Jon and I have set up
Two targets.

36:48.073 --> 36:51.474
We're gonna figure out which
One of us is more accurate.

36:51.476 --> 36:52.876
That person,
They're gonna end up.

36:52.878 --> 36:55.712
Being the shooter
For our final test.

36:55.714 --> 36:57.280
The shooter will be
Firing live rounds.

36:57.282 --> 36:59.749
At the good guy.

36:59.751 --> 37:02.552
Who will be holding up
The dead guy for protection.

37:07.893 --> 37:09.926
Gun safe!

37:09.928 --> 37:11.962
I'm not worried about a guy
From new york.

37:33.051 --> 37:36.486
Whoaho.

37:36.488 --> 37:40.090
While I did put two
In the center...

37:40.092 --> 37:41.658
My grouping is not so great.

37:41.660 --> 37:43.360
Those are beautiful, but...

37:43.362 --> 37:44.527
What happened there?

37:44.529 --> 37:45.895
And the important thing,
I think, when it comes.

37:45.897 --> 37:48.331
To shooting a moving target
Is putting out rounds fast.

37:48.333 --> 37:49.933
And putting them
Down accurately.

37:49.935 --> 37:51.568
- You want to take the shot?
- I'll take the shot.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.103
- Let's do it.
- All right.

37:53.105 --> 37:54.371
- Texas proud!
- Texas!

37:54.373 --> 37:55.739
Texas!

37:55.741 --> 37:58.275
So brian got the better of me,
At least this time.

38:04.283 --> 38:08.652
How's it going?

38:08.654 --> 38:10.754
Come here, buddy.

38:10.756 --> 38:12.822
Okay.

38:12.824 --> 38:14.758
How are we gonna tell
If picking up a body.

38:14.760 --> 38:16.026
During a gunfight.

38:16.028 --> 38:17.927
Will actually protect you
From oncoming bullets?

38:17.929 --> 38:21.231
I think we just found
A new workout program.

38:21.233 --> 38:23.533
Well, if the bullet
Goes into the syndaver.

38:23.535 --> 38:25.335
And stays there, we're good.

38:25.337 --> 38:26.736
How does he look?

38:26.738 --> 38:30.240
Yeah, me and him are just
Hanging out having a great time.

38:30.242 --> 38:35.211
Tres naturel.

38:35.213 --> 38:38.248
If that bullet goes through
The syndaver and the plywood,

38:38.250 --> 38:40.183
That's what we're calling
A lethal shot.

38:40.185 --> 38:41.284
What do you mean
It's not beautiful?

38:41.286 --> 38:42.886
I'm just saying.

38:52.764 --> 38:54.898
What do I think's gonna happen?

38:54.900 --> 38:56.199
I'm ready.

38:56.201 --> 38:57.467
All right. Here we go.

38:57.469 --> 38:59.769
I'm pretty hopeful
It's gonna work.

38:59.771 --> 39:01.971
Does a dead body in front
Of you protect you.

39:01.973 --> 39:04.040
From bullets in a gunfight?

39:04.042 --> 39:05.942
And now, finally,
We get a chance.

39:05.944 --> 39:08.144
To put this myth to the test.

39:08.146 --> 39:10.380
In 3, 2...

39:10.382 --> 39:12.415
I think this myth
Doesn't hold water,

39:12.417 --> 39:17.220
Much like a body full of holes.

39:17.222 --> 39:18.222
1!

39:24.930 --> 39:28.631
Hoho.

39:28.633 --> 39:33.336
The good guy drags
The dead body along the track.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.340
Brian unloads
20 rounds of selfdefense.

39:37.342 --> 39:39.042
Hollow point ammo...

39:41.513 --> 39:46.583
The good guy returns fire.

39:46.585 --> 39:48.918
Ooh, I shot myself.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.254
And all
The parameters match the mayhem.

39:51.256 --> 39:54.124
Of the mythical gunfight.

39:54.126 --> 39:56.626
Stop. Stop!

39:56.628 --> 39:59.095
- You good?
- Yeah.

39:59.097 --> 40:00.497
Okay, good.

40:00.499 --> 40:03.466
I shot myself twice.

40:03.468 --> 40:05.802
It's just beautiful
How scary it is.

40:05.804 --> 40:09.072
Looks... paintball paint.

40:09.074 --> 40:11.074
Jon, you might have killed me.

40:12.344 --> 40:15.111
Well, at least if I didn't,
I blew off your ear.

40:15.113 --> 40:16.679
I'm sorry, but I'm not sorry.

40:16.681 --> 40:19.449
What?

40:19.451 --> 40:20.717
It's results time.

40:20.719 --> 40:24.854
Is a dead body double
Really bulletproof?

40:24.856 --> 40:27.323
- Whoa.
- That's crazy.

40:27.325 --> 40:30.193
That looks like
A human flesh wound.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.428
Whoa.

40:31.430 --> 40:33.930
That is two to the belly,
Four to the chest.

40:33.932 --> 40:35.331
Shot him through the wrist.

40:35.333 --> 40:36.366
Look at that.

40:36.368 --> 40:37.967
You stick your finger
All the way.

40:37.969 --> 40:39.803
You can feel like all the bones
And the stuff inside that you,

40:39.805 --> 40:41.337
Like, crunched through.

40:41.339 --> 40:43.373
This is nuts.

40:43.375 --> 40:44.441
Yep. There's no doubting.

40:44.443 --> 40:46.142
The anatomical accuracy,

40:46.144 --> 40:50.313
But did it absorb brian's
Impressively accurate shots.

40:50.315 --> 40:53.550
And protect mr. Plywood?

40:53.552 --> 40:56.920
Drum roll please.

40:56.922 --> 40:58.688
Jon.

40:58.690 --> 41:00.056
That's right here, man.

41:00.058 --> 41:01.157
- That's one.
- Dude.

41:08.533 --> 41:10.066
I mean, look at that.

41:10.068 --> 41:13.703
That's, like, spine, through
The chest, femoral artery...

41:13.705 --> 41:14.871
- kidney.
- Lost a kidney or something.

41:14.873 --> 41:16.105
Yeah. I mean, he dead.

41:16.107 --> 41:19.576
Dead. Dead, dead and dead.

41:19.578 --> 41:22.445
He's dead.

41:22.447 --> 41:25.748
So it turns out that
Although you can carry a cadaver.

41:25.750 --> 41:29.352
And hold it up as a shield,
Even with ammo purposefully.

41:29.354 --> 41:33.256
Designed to prevent
Collateral damage,

41:33.258 --> 41:35.258
The result is definitive.

41:35.260 --> 41:37.994
- What do you think, man?
- Dude, busted.

41:37.996 --> 41:39.662
- Busted.
- All right. Let's go home.

41:39.664 --> 41:41.431
Okay.

41:41.433 --> 41:43.132
How far is it to walk home?

41:43.134 --> 41:45.735
I don't know.

41:45.737 --> 41:49.839
Just keep walking towards
That little valley over there.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.007
Look, a car.

42:01.887 --> 42:02.887
Look, a car.
