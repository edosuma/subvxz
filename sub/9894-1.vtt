01:05.300 --> 01:07.385
- Shorter here.
- Shorter?

01:07.385 --> 01:09.471
- Shorter.
- That is short enough.

01:10.305 --> 01:12.056
OK, superstar?

01:12.599 --> 01:15.310
- Wow!
- What's with the shirt?

01:25.569 --> 01:30.157
That is the most frightenin' thing
I've ever seen. Looks like a deformity.

01:30.240 --> 01:32.242
I'll fix that.

01:34.620 --> 01:37.664
- Oh, God... yeah...
- That's better.

01:37.748 --> 01:41.001
Now, if you was a guy,
I might even wanna fuck you.

01:41.001 --> 01:44.546
You mean if you was a guy
you might even wanna fuck me.

01:44.629 --> 01:47.882
So you're a boy. Now what?

01:50.802 --> 01:51.427
Come on.

01:53.721 --> 01:55.598
No fuckin' way.

01:55.681 --> 01:57.767
Yes fuckin' way.

01:57.892 --> 02:01.103
- A joke is a joke.
- Come on, don't be a pussy.

02:01.228 --> 02:02.980
I'm no pussy. Let's go home.

02:04.356 --> 02:07.151
- Someone's inside.
- You've got a date?

02:07.985 --> 02:09.570
I gotta go.

02:09.652 --> 02:11.655
Come here!

02:12.573 --> 02:14.574
Can I talk to you just for a minute?

02:18.745 --> 02:21.539
You look like a fuckin' idiot in that hat.

02:22.916 --> 02:25.627
I'll be back. I'll be back.

02:25.627 --> 02:27.170
Teena...

02:29.464 --> 02:31.132
I don't want you comin' here

02:32.592 --> 02:34.468
And wastin' all my time

02:51.568 --> 02:53.570
I don't mind you hangin' out

02:55.238 --> 02:57.198
And talkin' in your sleep

02:58.783 --> 03:01.703
Yeah... athletic's nice.

03:01.786 --> 03:05.873
But the thing is he's sweet.
And good hair. That's important.

03:13.589 --> 03:16.092
I'm Billy. Are... are you Nicole?

03:17.426 --> 03:19.929
... and talkin' in your sleep

03:21.722 --> 03:23.390
I guess you're just what I needed

03:23.474 --> 03:25.475
Just what I needed

03:25.559 --> 03:28.478
I needed someone to feed...

03:28.603 --> 03:31.523
You don't seem like you're from around here.

03:33.191 --> 03:35.694
Where do I seem like I'm from?

03:37.779 --> 03:39.948
Someplace beautiful.

03:56.630 --> 03:59.466
I'll stand right here until
you're safe inside, OK?

03:59.466 --> 04:01.009
OK.

04:14.481 --> 04:16.565
You're just what I needed

04:21.988 --> 04:23.948
You're just what I needed

04:29.703 --> 04:31.664
You're just what I needed

04:45.343 --> 04:46.678
You're not goin' anywhere!

04:48.054 --> 04:49.097
Fucker!

04:49.931 --> 04:52.308
Get back here, you fucker!

04:55.561 --> 04:58.773
- You fuckin' dyke!
- You freak!

04:58.898 --> 05:02.944
- You fucked my sister!
- Open the fuckin' door, you fuckin' faggot!

05:03.069 --> 05:05.363
- Open the fuckin' door!
- Open this goddamn door!

05:05.446 --> 05:07.531
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Brothers!

05:07.656 --> 05:09.825
- I'll kick your fuckin' ass!
- Alicia.

05:09.950 --> 05:12.036
- Who is Alicia?
- You fuckin' dyke!

05:12.119 --> 05:14.830
- Damn, there's a lot of 'em!
- What have you done?!

05:14.955 --> 05:17.457
Your fuckin' faggot cousin, too!

05:17.541 --> 05:19.626
- Fuck!
- What is the matter with you?

05:19.751 --> 05:22.254
I don't know! I don't know what went wrong!

05:22.337 --> 05:25.674
You are not a boy! That is what
went wrong! You are not a boy!

05:25.799 --> 05:28.510
They say I'm the best
boyfriend they ever had.

05:28.510 --> 05:32.055
Do you want your mother to lock you up
again? Is that what you want?

05:32.138 --> 05:33.598
No.

05:34.557 --> 05:38.102
Then why don't you just admit
that you're a dyke?

05:38.102 --> 05:39.562
Because I'm not a dyke.

05:39.645 --> 05:41.230
Fucker!

05:43.941 --> 05:48.529
- What are you doin'? Get outta my pants.
- The money you owe me. I want it back.

05:48.529 --> 05:50.197
Jesus!

05:51.448 --> 05:54.576
Careful with that.
You didn't have to do that. Jeez!

05:54.660 --> 05:59.664
You're not crashin' here any more, Teena.
Get your stuff and go.

06:34.281 --> 06:35.949
Bad night?

06:38.785 --> 06:40.745
The worst.

06:56.927 --> 06:59.930
- So what's your name?
- Candace.

07:02.016 --> 07:05.477
I hate it, though. I'm thinkin' of changin' it.

07:05.477 --> 07:07.563
Sometimes that helps.

07:07.980 --> 07:09.439
I'm Brandon.

07:18.490 --> 07:20.783
I'll pay if you get 'em.

07:20.909 --> 07:23.202
- Sure.
- Marlboros.

07:23.286 --> 07:25.079
I'll be right back.

07:33.295 --> 07:35.506
Check this out.

07:36.757 --> 07:38.425
My friend's sittin' there.

07:38.425 --> 07:40.177
So?

07:42.679 --> 07:44.056
I said get off.

07:44.139 --> 07:49.478
Excuse me. Why don't you leave the lady
alone? I don't want any trouble here.

07:52.397 --> 07:54.899
You gotta be kiddin' me.

07:54.899 --> 07:58.236
I didn't ask you what you wanted,
you little fag.

08:08.663 --> 08:11.373
You fucker! You motherfucker!

08:11.457 --> 08:14.168
- I'll kick your white hick ass!
- Hold on, cowboy.

08:14.501 --> 08:17.296
Can't I leave you alone for five minutes?

08:17.421 --> 08:20.340
You fuck! I'm gonna get your ass!

08:23.343 --> 08:25.637
Come on, stud. You got us into this.

08:25.762 --> 08:27.722
Fucker!

08:39.107 --> 08:41.611
Oh, shit. Cops, man.

08:42.528 --> 08:44.530
They suck.

08:45.781 --> 08:49.326
I would've had those guys
if you wouldn't have stopped me.

08:50.035 --> 08:52.871
Oh, my God! John, look.

08:55.040 --> 08:57.751
You're gonna have a shiner in the mornin'.

08:57.876 --> 08:59.836
- I am?
- Yeah.

09:00.045 --> 09:02.047
Oh, shit!

09:02.130 --> 09:05.383
- You got a light, man?
- Oh, yeah, here.

09:11.723 --> 09:13.725
You have got the tiniest hands.

09:13.725 --> 09:16.727
No. They're big.

09:17.061 --> 09:20.898
- Joe Louis had tiny hands.
- He didn't throw punches without defence.

09:21.440 --> 09:24.860
If you're gonna get into fights
over girls, learn a few moves.

09:27.696 --> 09:29.657
Come on.

09:36.246 --> 09:38.832
- Hey, pussy.
- Fuck you, man!

09:38.957 --> 09:41.543
- Tom, this is Brandon.
- Hey.

09:41.877 --> 09:46.131
John. We'll give you a ride home,
as soon as we find the goddamn car!

09:46.256 --> 09:49.467
Sorry! It's up here somewhere!

09:49.801 --> 09:52.095
We're goin' to a party. You wanna come?

09:52.178 --> 09:54.806
Candace, it's 70 miles away.

09:55.097 --> 09:59.685
I don't care. I mean, the night
is young and... and I am a mess, so...

10:06.692 --> 10:08.152
Good.

10:29.005 --> 10:31.591
Are we there yet?

10:31.716 --> 10:36.929
It's just up ahead... unless you wanna stop
at a roadhouse and get in another fight.

11:09.335 --> 11:12.380
I don't know where the fuck I am.

11:16.759 --> 11:18.844
Falls City?

11:18.927 --> 11:22.473
What are you doin' down there?
That's not even on the map.

11:22.598 --> 11:24.057
Oh, fuck!

11:24.057 --> 11:26.435
Lonny, my life is a fuckin' nightmare.

11:26.560 --> 11:31.439
I got this big court date next week
and I don't got anywhere to stay.

11:31.565 --> 11:35.819
If I don't make it, I'm fucked.
Can I just stay at your house?

11:35.944 --> 11:38.112
- What about those doctors?
- I went.

11:38.238 --> 11:42.408
It's insane. You gotta see shrinks,
shoot hormones up your butt,

11:42.492 --> 11:47.204
and it costs a fuckin' fortune. I'll be
an old man before I get that kinda money.

11:47.288 --> 11:48.956
You gotta do somethin'.

11:49.081 --> 11:52.835
You can't just keep runnin',
because you'll end up in jail.

11:52.918 --> 11:54.920
For ever.

11:57.506 --> 11:59.591
You really think I can do it?

11:59.716 --> 12:01.593
You're the butch.

12:01.593 --> 12:03.762
Now come straight to my house.

12:03.887 --> 12:06.807
No stoppin' in bars, no stealin'...

12:06.890 --> 12:10.143
- And no more girls.
- No more girls.

12:12.103 --> 12:14.522
- No more girls.
- Hey, handsome.

12:15.982 --> 12:18.359
- Sleep all right?
- Yeah.

12:20.153 --> 12:22.029
Candace.

12:22.029 --> 12:24.115
I remember.

12:24.115 --> 12:26.075
- This is Cody.
- Cody.

12:26.200 --> 12:27.952
Wow! Beautiful.

12:28.077 --> 12:30.371
You still broodin' over your fiancÃ©e?

12:30.663 --> 12:31.622
What?

12:31.622 --> 12:34.541
Oh. It's a real long story.

12:36.210 --> 12:38.378
God, you're really good with kids.

12:38.712 --> 12:41.089
Yeah... I got one of my own.

12:51.224 --> 12:53.726
Hey, Brandon! Good news.

12:54.978 --> 12:56.938
- I got you a ride.
- All right!

12:57.063 --> 13:00.900
- He's goin' to Lincoln later tonight.
- Oh, wow!

13:02.151 --> 13:04.153
Cool.

13:24.381 --> 13:26.341
You suck!

13:27.801 --> 13:29.677
- Hey, champ!
- Hey!

13:29.802 --> 13:32.930
Tom only dates girls
with a little butt and a long crack,

13:32.930 --> 13:37.101
right up to the small of the back.
That's how he picks 'em.

13:38.144 --> 13:41.272
Tom likes 'em coyote ugly.
You know coyote ugly?

13:41.272 --> 13:43.649
I'm all over some booty!

13:46.276 --> 13:47.736
Thank you.

13:51.782 --> 13:56.912
- Looks like you're ridin' with Ted Bundy.
- Shut up, John. He looks fine, right?

13:56.995 --> 13:59.289
Yeah, just like family.

13:59.414 --> 14:01.708
- Speakin' of.
- Hey, where's Lana?

14:01.708 --> 14:04.210
We were gonna go on, but she wandered off.

14:04.294 --> 14:06.296
You got time to stick around, right?

14:06.379 --> 14:10.466
These girls get their shit together,
they're gonna do some karaoke.

14:14.512 --> 14:16.931
Lana! Where you been?

14:19.308 --> 14:22.144
Come on, Lana. Let's go on already.

14:22.144 --> 14:24.521
Lana, it was your idea!

14:30.485 --> 14:32.779
Who are you?

15:09.481 --> 15:11.983
The lonesome Texas sun

15:12.484 --> 15:14.486
Was settin' slow

15:17.614 --> 15:20.617
And in the rear-view mirror

15:20.742 --> 15:22.702
I watched it go

15:25.955 --> 15:27.498
Shut the fuck up!

15:28.457 --> 15:30.626
In her golden hair

15:33.671 --> 15:36.799
I close my eyes for a moment

15:37.007 --> 15:39.384
I'm still there

15:42.304 --> 15:45.223
The bluest eyes in Texas

15:46.183 --> 15:49.311
Are hauntin' me tonight

15:52.647 --> 15:54.524
Another town

15:54.607 --> 15:57.652
Another hotel room

16:00.988 --> 16:06.494
Another dream that ended way too soon

16:09.538 --> 16:11.415
Left me lonely

16:11.498 --> 16:14.960
Prayin' for the dawn

16:18.297 --> 16:24.344
Searchin' for the strength to carry on

16:26.304 --> 16:29.557
The bluest eyes in Texas

16:30.475 --> 16:33.311
Are hauntin' me tonight

16:34.771 --> 16:37.899
Like the stars that fill...

16:53.330 --> 16:56.333
What the fuck...?
You were gonna be five minutes!

16:56.458 --> 17:01.254
- We got stuck in time warp!
- Jesus, get in the car already.

17:10.430 --> 17:13.974
- Brandon, come with us.
- He's a psycho killer, anyways.

17:14.058 --> 17:16.978
- Crash with me again.
- One more night, Tyson!

17:18.436 --> 17:20.439
Come on, buddy.

17:35.954 --> 17:39.207
Like I was sayin'...
I get to the house, you know?

17:39.207 --> 17:42.210
My sister was totally naked
and totally on fire. Right, John?

17:42.335 --> 17:45.880
- Tom was like "Where's my camera?"
- You saved everyone?

17:45.880 --> 17:50.051
Oh, yeah. Tom's a big hero.
He rescued everybody. Right, dickwad?

17:50.134 --> 17:55.264
So when they brought me in, they said "This
is the biggest fire we've seen in 50 years!"

17:55.348 --> 17:59.226
"You're a hero, man!" And I was like "Yeah?"
And they were like "Yeah".

17:59.310 --> 18:02.354
That's why they put me in
all them Lincoln newspapers.

18:02.438 --> 18:04.440
- Probably seen me.
- That's cool.

18:05.482 --> 18:08.902
- What the hell is that?
- Bumper-skiing, man.

18:11.613 --> 18:13.615
Thank you.

18:16.117 --> 18:19.037
Flippin' burgers. That's for squares, man.

18:19.120 --> 18:21.956
Give me real work,
like in the oilfields or somethin'.

18:22.040 --> 18:24.959
I wanna be a smoke jumper
out in Mount St Helens.

18:25.084 --> 18:28.212
You know, fightin' fires,
makin' lots of money,

18:28.296 --> 18:32.466
and then travellin' all around:
Memphis, Graceland, Tennessee...

18:32.592 --> 18:36.971
You dick. Graceland is in Memphis
and Memphis is in Tennessee.

18:39.765 --> 18:42.267
I know.

18:45.938 --> 18:48.440
- Maybe you've had enough.
- I ain't had any.

18:48.523 --> 18:54.362
No shit, man. People like you, you don't need
drugs. You just hallucinate 24 hours a day.

19:04.914 --> 19:07.083
All right, Tom, you're up.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.085
Not me, man. I'm drinkin'.

19:10.336 --> 19:12.296
Brandon, that means you.

19:12.421 --> 19:15.966
- Yeah, stud! Let's go, cowboy!
- Come on, you can do it.

19:20.554 --> 19:23.265
Brandon is a mean prizefighter from Lincoln.

19:23.348 --> 19:26.393
Be careful what you say to him.
Tough. Very tough.

19:26.476 --> 19:28.687
Don't let 'em scare ya. You can do it.

19:48.706 --> 19:49.957
Freak!

19:51.417 --> 19:53.502
Come on!

20:00.175 --> 20:02.469
You can do better than that!

20:05.805 --> 20:07.682
One more time.

20:07.682 --> 20:09.976
John, come on. Stop it, John.

20:10.060 --> 20:12.270
Oh, OK, OK.

20:18.526 --> 20:20.194
- Take it easy.
- I'm fine.

20:20.278 --> 20:24.990
Yeah, you're fine. You're fucked up,
you know? You are one crazy little fucker.

20:25.074 --> 20:27.910
- What are we goin' to do with you?
- Man, it's nothin'.

20:28.744 --> 20:32.164
Wait, where are we goin'?
Wait, I'll drive!

21:55.994 --> 21:57.996
There's a diamond

21:57.996 --> 22:00.290
In her eye

22:00.373 --> 22:02.584
It's a-shinin'

22:02.667 --> 22:04.669
Up above

22:07.171 --> 22:09.465
And the moon

22:09.465 --> 22:11.551
In the sky

22:11.634 --> 22:13.636
Say you want it

22:13.719 --> 22:15.721
Tell her why

22:23.103 --> 22:25.105
Where gamblers

22:25.189 --> 22:27.399
Tell you lies

22:27.399 --> 22:29.568
She'll take a tumble

22:29.693 --> 22:31.653
And never lose

22:34.155 --> 22:36.449
And in the mornin'

22:36.574 --> 22:38.535
She'll wear a smile

22:38.660 --> 22:40.620
She's made of stars

22:40.745 --> 22:42.288
Oh, hi.

22:44.791 --> 22:46.793
You sell, uh...

22:46.793 --> 22:50.129
- Ruffles?
- Ruffles. Right over there.

22:50.212 --> 22:52.214
Thank you.

23:06.061 --> 23:07.938
Dream on, Lana.

23:08.480 --> 23:11.691
- I can't be sellin' you no beer tonight.
- Fine. I'll browse.

23:16.070 --> 23:18.698
The beer's in the back if you want it.

23:27.456 --> 23:28.916
Hey.

23:28.999 --> 23:31.502
Space cowboy!

23:33.087 --> 23:36.715
I'm so wasted. I don't know
if I'm ever gonna come down.

23:36.840 --> 23:39.218
- That's OK.
- I need beer.

23:39.343 --> 23:42.262
Come here.

23:42.346 --> 23:44.347
It's OK. It's OK.

23:48.935 --> 23:51.438
It's OK. Here.

23:51.438 --> 23:54.023
- It's for me.
- Can I see some ID?

23:54.148 --> 23:55.275
Sure.

23:55.400 --> 23:57.068
How beautiful!

23:57.068 --> 24:01.030
Jesus Christ, I feel like I'm on acid.
It's like an album cover.

24:03.199 --> 24:05.618
Would you, uh... care to join me?

24:07.078 --> 24:09.371
- Come on.
- Fuck off!

24:09.455 --> 24:13.542
Don't you talk to me like that,
you skanky little snake.

24:15.836 --> 24:17.379
Kwik Stop.

24:20.424 --> 24:22.384
Hey! Lana!

24:22.717 --> 24:25.637
Lana, wait. I'll drive you. I got Candace's car.

24:25.720 --> 24:27.597
I'm walkin'.

24:27.722 --> 24:29.682
Well, here.

24:32.393 --> 24:35.229
What are you still hangin' around here for?

24:35.229 --> 24:39.400
Well, I thought someone oughta
walk you home before you get an MIP.

24:39.483 --> 24:41.986
I don't need anybody to walk me anywhere.

24:45.030 --> 24:48.367
- Jeez, watch it.
- I don't need you to stop me from trippin'.

24:48.450 --> 24:51.286
Lana, you are one cranky girl.

24:52.621 --> 24:56.583
You'd be cranky, too, Mr I'm-Going-
To-Memphis-Graceland-Tennessee,

24:56.708 --> 25:01.922
if you were stuck where there's nothin'
to do but go bumper-skiing and chase bats.

25:01.922 --> 25:04.507
Hey, I've been bored my whole life.

25:05.467 --> 25:10.471
Is that why you let John tie you to the back
of a truck and drag you around like a dog?

25:10.555 --> 25:14.016
No. I just thought that's
what guys do around here.

25:19.105 --> 25:22.566
Wait a minute. What's your name again?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.486
Brandon.

25:29.031 --> 25:31.325
The discs... took off from here.

25:34.036 --> 25:36.329
That's all there is. Let's go back.

25:38.623 --> 25:40.792
Lana? Lana?

25:43.503 --> 25:45.797
Look, just go on home, OK?

25:49.050 --> 25:51.552
God, I hate my life.

25:51.552 --> 25:53.638
Lana?

25:54.972 --> 25:57.183
I hate your life, too.

25:58.100 --> 26:02.604
- Don't look at my stupid house.
- I'm not lookin' at your stupid house.

26:02.688 --> 26:04.690
I'm lookin' at you.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.863
What was I thinkin'?

26:15.617 --> 26:17.619
Mom... come on.

26:19.079 --> 26:21.039
Come on!

26:21.581 --> 26:23.666
Did you eat?

26:27.295 --> 26:29.505
It's all right.

26:32.008 --> 26:33.968
Don't. It's OK.

26:39.306 --> 26:43.268
Hi. Here, drink this.
You'll feel better in the mornin'.

26:44.394 --> 26:45.562
Come on.

27:00.868 --> 27:02.954
It's good for ya.

27:04.539 --> 27:07.250
Yeah, I got a thing for cow.

27:07.750 --> 27:09.835
I know a song about cows.

27:10.461 --> 27:14.340
- My dad taught it to me.
- You're not gonna sing it for me, are ya?

27:14.423 --> 27:17.885
No. I can't sing to save my life.

27:18.719 --> 27:21.305
- Me neither.
- What?

27:21.430 --> 27:24.141
Sure you can. You sing great.

27:24.224 --> 27:26.309
That wasn't me. It was the karaoke.

27:27.144 --> 27:28.937
So?

27:29.020 --> 27:31.106
You were still great.

27:31.231 --> 27:32.899
I couldn't do it.

27:32.982 --> 27:35.193
A lot of people I know couldn't.

28:13.646 --> 28:15.940
You don't know any songs about cows?

28:18.568 --> 28:20.528
Sure I do.

28:32.623 --> 28:38.378
Comin' to you this beautiful Friday,
October 27 th, this is Corn Report.

28:38.378 --> 28:43.049
It is 8am. It is 45 degrees.
You'd better watch out. That winter is comin'.

28:48.471 --> 28:49.931
Hey.

28:50.056 --> 28:52.141
Is it always this nice in the mornin'?

28:52.225 --> 28:54.644
I made you a little breakfast.

28:55.978 --> 28:57.980
Wow!

29:00.483 --> 29:02.651
Thank you.

29:09.241 --> 29:10.909
My hand sucks.

29:10.993 --> 29:13.620
How come Aunt Lana's asleep?

29:13.620 --> 29:19.542
Well, your Aunt Lana is a nice girl, but
she is as lazy as the day is long, sweetheart.

29:19.668 --> 29:21.961
Don't you be like that, OK? Huh?

29:23.004 --> 29:26.549
- Answer if somebody asks a question.
- How are things with her mother?

29:26.633 --> 29:28.843
She gave me April for a couple of days.

29:31.012 --> 29:34.056
I love this song! Yes! Yes!

29:34.056 --> 29:37.601
- Who's that lady?
- Who's that lady?

29:37.601 --> 29:38.853
Who's that lady?

29:38.936 --> 29:40.938
A real, real, real fine lady

29:41.021 --> 29:42.189
Beautiful lady

29:42.273 --> 29:46.652
I wish somebody would introduce her to me

29:46.777 --> 29:49.071
Oh, get up. Dance with me.

29:49.154 --> 29:51.365
Come on. Get up.

29:51.365 --> 29:53.033
I didn't get a chance

29:53.116 --> 29:54.493
I asked her to dance

29:54.576 --> 29:56.369
Asked her to dance

29:56.453 --> 29:58.747
It was love at first sight...

29:59.080 --> 30:01.040
April... come here.

30:03.459 --> 30:05.420
Jesus, turn down the goddamn music!

30:09.507 --> 30:12.843
- Come on, honey. Loosen up.
- No, let me go, let me go.

30:14.386 --> 30:18.474
You motherfuckers!
Why did they let you fuckheads outta jail?

30:44.415 --> 30:48.502
Belly is cravin', I got a shakin' in my head

30:49.337 --> 30:54.133
I feel like I'm dyin' and I wish I was dead

30:54.216 --> 30:59.346
If I live till tomorrow, that'd be a long time.

30:59.430 --> 31:04.768
I'll reel and I'll fall, but I'll rise on cod'ine.

31:06.311 --> 31:08.605
You'll forget you're a woman

31:08.730 --> 31:11.107
You'll forget about men

31:11.650 --> 31:16.112
Try it just once and you'll try it again

31:17.071 --> 31:19.157
You'll forget about life

31:19.157 --> 31:21.951
You'll forget about time

31:22.076 --> 31:27.081
And live all your days a slave to cod'ine

31:27.081 --> 31:31.460
And it's real, oh, it's real

31:31.543 --> 31:34.380
One more time

31:37.716 --> 31:41.470
And some of them fall

31:41.970 --> 31:45.015
And rise on cod'ine

31:49.811 --> 31:51.688
I'm an asshole.

31:54.190 --> 31:55.316
What?

31:55.441 --> 31:56.693
Blowout.

31:56.984 --> 32:00.238
- What happened?
- Aw, I'm in the doghouse again.

32:00.238 --> 32:02.615
- I've been there my whole life.
- Women, right?

32:02.740 --> 32:04.408
Yeah.

32:05.659 --> 32:10.122
- You gonna do a little damage control?
- And then you'll fuck it up again.

32:10.247 --> 32:12.833
Come on. Oh, my goodness!

32:12.958 --> 32:16.169
Hey... who are you? What's your name, huh?

32:16.295 --> 32:18.588
- April.
- April?

32:18.588 --> 32:21.591
- How'd you get such a pretty name?
- My daddy.

32:21.716 --> 32:24.010
Yeah, that's true. I named her.

32:24.302 --> 32:26.304
- Where are you goin'?
- See Lana.

32:26.388 --> 32:28.389
All right. Go on.

32:31.517 --> 32:33.603
Got an extra cig, man?

32:36.105 --> 32:37.440
Thanks, man.

32:37.982 --> 32:40.901
Is, uh... is she Lana's?

32:41.736 --> 32:43.279
Lana's? No.

32:44.238 --> 32:48.075
No, I had April with a different girl. Mallory.

32:48.492 --> 32:52.788
This here's my real family,
even if it isn't my real home, you know?

32:53.205 --> 32:55.082
I mean...

32:55.582 --> 32:57.250
Lana...

32:57.793 --> 33:00.503
I don't know. It's kinda hard to explain.

33:02.464 --> 33:07.802
Well, I got 12 more like this at home.
I keep it in a secret place.

33:09.053 --> 33:12.265
She wrote to me when I was in lockup.

33:12.390 --> 33:14.559
- Lana did?
- Yup. She wrote to me.

33:14.684 --> 33:18.729
Even my own mom didn't
write to me. But she did.

33:18.854 --> 33:22.399
Lana and her mom. They took me in.

33:25.944 --> 33:27.404
Fuck. Fucker.

33:27.404 --> 33:31.992
- Brandon, honey, where are your folks from?
- I'm from Lincoln.

33:32.075 --> 33:35.537
But my dad's out in Memphis right now,

33:35.954 --> 33:37.622
and my mom's in Hollywood.

33:37.622 --> 33:39.374
- Hollywood?
- Yeah.

33:39.499 --> 33:42.836
- Oh, wow!
- Yeah. My sister's a model.

33:42.919 --> 33:45.338
- That's glamorous!
- Hey, Brandon,

33:45.421 --> 33:48.674
- Why don't you clean these ashtrays for us?
- Fuck you!

33:48.674 --> 33:50.635
I'm just playin' with you, bud.

33:50.760 --> 33:53.137
Brandon, honey, come here.

33:53.262 --> 33:55.848
Over here. Closer, where I can see you.

33:55.973 --> 33:58.892
Let me look at you in the light. Come on.

33:58.976 --> 34:00.978
Come on.

34:02.104 --> 34:04.106
Come here. Let me.

34:06.400 --> 34:09.319
I can believe you got a model for a sister.

34:09.402 --> 34:12.322
You're like a little movie star yourself.

34:21.706 --> 34:24.333
Hey, April. Want a beer?

34:24.417 --> 34:27.879
Hey! What the fuck are you doin'?

34:27.962 --> 34:31.215
Here you go, hon. Here you go.
Have some of Daddy's.

34:31.215 --> 34:33.717
Come on. Come on. Little bit.

34:33.801 --> 34:39.639
Four years ago, you wouldn't have thought
he could take care of himself, let alone a kid.

34:39.764 --> 34:43.810
Shit, four years ago you wouldn't
have been able to talk to him.

34:43.936 --> 34:45.478
Prison?

34:46.646 --> 34:49.858
And her mother! Jesus Christ!

34:51.234 --> 34:53.110
And this one...

34:53.194 --> 34:58.116
- This one kept that boy's spirit alive.
- Mom, just forget about that.

35:01.953 --> 35:05.831
The little bastard pissed on me!
She hasn't had the proper trainin'!

35:05.915 --> 35:10.211
- Your mother's an asshole, you know that?
- John, she had an accident.

35:10.294 --> 35:14.173
It's OK, sweetie. It's not your fault.

35:18.010 --> 35:19.386
Havin' fun?

35:20.095 --> 35:22.097
Yeah.

35:22.180 --> 35:25.934
- What do you think of my mom? Weird, huh?
- No, I like her.

35:26.893 --> 35:28.979
I think she's funny.

35:29.062 --> 35:32.607
- Are you for real?
- Excuse me. Am I interruptin' somethin'?

35:32.732 --> 35:36.361
Take a picture of me and my daughter.
Lana's dad gave us that.

35:36.486 --> 35:40.656
- I don't feel like havin' my picture taken.
- Come on, honey. Just one.

35:40.656 --> 35:42.199
Come on, son.

35:44.410 --> 35:46.912
Well... refill time.

35:46.996 --> 35:49.206
Bring it in when you're ready, OK?

35:56.713 --> 35:59.007
Here, look. It's not bad, huh?

36:00.759 --> 36:02.344
What?

36:03.470 --> 36:06.514
- No.
- Why not? You're beautiful.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.642
Come over here.

36:18.609 --> 36:21.612
I had a dream about you last night.

36:21.737 --> 36:24.532
You did? What happened?

36:26.408 --> 36:28.619
Come on, tell me the dream.

36:30.162 --> 36:34.249
Someone walked me home
last night. I think it was you.

36:37.586 --> 36:39.671
No fair!

36:47.470 --> 36:49.972
Lana! It's time to go to work!

36:55.311 --> 36:59.482
John, you're too fucked up.
Why don't you let Brandon drive?

37:01.025 --> 37:03.527
Hey. Here you go, little buddy.

37:05.195 --> 37:07.197
You all right?

37:07.698 --> 37:09.700
Tom!

37:25.632 --> 37:28.760
Nice car.
Why don't you turn down your radio?

37:28.885 --> 37:30.845
Yeah, totally.

37:32.513 --> 37:35.766
- What the fuck are you lookin' at?
- Wall people.

37:35.766 --> 37:38.143
- What the fuck did you say?
- Wall people.

37:38.269 --> 37:40.354
Let me outta this fuckin' car!

37:40.980 --> 37:43.065
Bite me, you fuckin' fudgepacker!

37:43.065 --> 37:45.567
- Eat me.
- Fuck you!

37:48.487 --> 37:50.989
- Go after 'em!
- Step on it!

38:02.667 --> 38:04.335
Go! Come on, go!

38:04.335 --> 38:07.755
Come on, pussy. Go faster, you cocksucker.

38:10.257 --> 38:12.468
Come on, Brandon! Go!

38:23.186 --> 38:25.605
Go, Brandon!

38:46.042 --> 38:50.004
Oh, no, it's the man!
Fuck! It's the piggers!

38:50.087 --> 38:52.923
Come on, these cops are onto us.
What the fuck...?

38:55.300 --> 38:57.386
Don't stop, don't stop. Go faster.

38:58.428 --> 39:00.847
- Brandon...
- Go faster.

39:02.599 --> 39:04.601
Brandon, stop.

39:05.519 --> 39:09.397
That's it, that's it.
They ain't got no fuckin' balls.

39:16.779 --> 39:19.615
When you hit the gravel, drop to 40.

39:32.419 --> 39:33.670
I can't see.

39:38.258 --> 39:42.345
That's OK. Neither can he. You're flyin'.

40:18.713 --> 40:20.715
Take it out.

40:25.553 --> 40:28.473
Get off me, dick. I wasn't doin' anythin'.

40:28.556 --> 40:31.267
Goin' awful fast back there, Mr Brayman.

40:31.392 --> 40:34.937
- Tell me what you're doin' in Falls City.
- Just visitin', sir.

40:35.021 --> 40:37.315
Yeah? Where are you stayin'?

40:41.402 --> 40:43.487
He's stayin' with me.

40:49.618 --> 40:52.454
I can't run a check on this.
Our computers are down.

40:52.454 --> 40:54.831
But I could run you all in right now.

40:58.376 --> 41:02.130
You could let these guys go.
They ain't got anythin' to do with it.

41:02.255 --> 41:04.549
I got a little carried away back there.

41:04.632 --> 41:09.137
- We don't got anythin' like this in Lincoln.
- A dustless highway?

41:10.054 --> 41:14.225
Only one in Nebraska.
That's a hundred-foot drop.

41:17.061 --> 41:20.189
- I won't lock you up, but you get a ticket.
- OK.

41:20.189 --> 41:23.942
Those are residential streets
back there, so you slow down.

41:24.026 --> 41:26.862
- Do you read me, Mr Brayman?
- Absolutely, sir.

41:27.487 --> 41:30.615
Did you see this ID?
That's pretty slick: Charles Brayman.

41:30.699 --> 41:33.410
I let you down. I'm sorry.

41:33.535 --> 41:37.288
Man, don't worry. We'll take you
to the tunnel, chase some bats.

41:37.372 --> 41:40.834
Yeah... it's like the tunnel of love.

41:40.917 --> 41:43.336
God, Candace, would you get a grip?

41:43.419 --> 41:47.298
- Is that your real birthday?
- No. November 10th, '72.

41:47.381 --> 41:50.509
Hey, that's next week. Let's have a party.

41:50.635 --> 41:53.429
21! You're gonna be a man!

41:54.597 --> 41:56.056
Shit.

41:57.600 --> 42:00.102
Don't you never pull that shit again.

42:01.562 --> 42:05.107
- What?
- You heard. Don't never pull that shit again.

42:05.232 --> 42:08.151
You got me stopped by the fuckin' cops.

42:08.235 --> 42:12.822
Why... But you're the one
who told me to race after 'em.

42:12.948 --> 42:15.450
I had you in the clear and you fucked up.

42:17.952 --> 42:21.080
John, it's over. Don't get upset.

42:23.791 --> 42:26.377
I'm not upset.

42:26.502 --> 42:28.587
You almost got us killed.

42:32.132 --> 42:36.512
- I almost got us killed?
- Whoo! Brandon...

42:36.595 --> 42:40.682
- You led us 90mph into a cloud of dust.
- Brandon...

42:40.766 --> 42:45.270
- We were about to go off a 400-foot ravine.
- Shit! Fuck!

42:45.896 --> 42:47.981
- Get outta my goddamn car.
- All right...

42:48.064 --> 42:50.483
Get outta my motherfuckin' car!

42:50.567 --> 42:54.654
- Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin' car!
- Shit! Get off me, you sick fuck!

42:54.737 --> 42:59.534
Get outta my goddamn motherfuckin'
shit-eatin' cocksuckin' car!

42:59.659 --> 43:01.619
Get out!

43:06.415 --> 43:08.292
- Not you.
- Fuck you!

43:36.235 --> 43:38.529
Welcome to the psycho ward.

43:49.707 --> 43:52.292
Come on, Kate. He's takin' us to work.

43:53.043 --> 43:55.837
You know, Tom set that fire hisself.

44:12.437 --> 44:14.397
That's my car!

44:18.359 --> 44:21.195
Doctors say he ain't got no impulse control.

44:23.572 --> 44:26.283
I'm the only one who can control that fucker.

44:29.620 --> 44:33.290
Come on. We'll walk you home, Candace.

44:37.043 --> 44:39.004
You ever try this?

44:41.631 --> 44:45.260
Tom, did you set your own
family's house on fire?

44:52.266 --> 44:54.769
What about this?

44:54.769 --> 44:56.854
You ever do this?

44:59.773 --> 45:01.650
What the fuck, Tom?

45:02.901 --> 45:05.404
Some people punch holes in walls.

45:06.446 --> 45:09.574
This... helps snap me back into reality.

45:09.658 --> 45:14.371
Gets a control of this thing inside of me,
so I don't... lash out at someone.

45:16.748 --> 45:21.127
Me and John used to do it
to ourselves all the time in lockup.

45:21.252 --> 45:24.672
I could always go deeper than him.
He was such a wuss.

45:33.139 --> 45:34.598
Try it.

45:43.023 --> 45:45.651
I guess I am a pussy, compared to you.

45:53.033 --> 45:55.326
I'm just jokin' with you, man.

46:36.324 --> 46:38.076
Fuck!

46:39.243 --> 46:40.912
Fuck!

46:58.303 --> 47:00.722
Brandon... hey.

47:02.265 --> 47:06.561
- Lana.
- I'm so sorry. I just had to see someone nice.

47:06.645 --> 47:09.564
I just got off work.
I'm havin' a nervous breakdown.

47:09.689 --> 47:12.066
Just a minute. I have to pee, OK?

47:17.405 --> 47:20.950
God, I was scared to death that
Candace was gonna catch me.

47:21.033 --> 47:25.538
She's obsessed with findin' a husband.
You're her favourite candidate.

47:25.621 --> 47:29.375
I can't believe you worked last night.
You must be exhausted.

47:29.500 --> 47:34.713
Me neither. I do it all the time, though.
You don't have to be sober to weigh spinach.

47:36.465 --> 47:38.675
Thanks for the coffee.

47:43.138 --> 47:45.557
I'm crashin' really hard, though.

47:47.100 --> 47:51.604
l, um... have to go back to Lincoln
to take care of some stuff.

47:54.107 --> 47:57.109
- You really leavin'?
- Yeah.

47:57.235 --> 48:00.237
Are you gonna see your sister? The model?

48:00.988 --> 48:02.740
Yeah.

48:04.200 --> 48:05.784
Nicole?

48:06.827 --> 48:09.413
She's pretty. Is she gonna be there?

48:09.538 --> 48:14.001
Yeah. Now that she's married,
we're gonna be takin' off any second.

48:16.503 --> 48:21.508
So... where are you goin'
on your big trip outta here?

48:25.386 --> 48:29.974
I don't know.
I guess it's not all worked out yet.

48:30.058 --> 48:32.476
That's OK.

48:35.062 --> 48:38.190
Thanks for givin' your address to the cops.

48:39.984 --> 48:41.944
It was nothin'.

48:50.285 --> 48:52.162
I might hitchhike.

48:52.287 --> 48:54.789
Really? I've never done that.

48:55.916 --> 48:57.917
Me neither.

49:03.965 --> 49:05.633
Well...

49:08.970 --> 49:12.390
This might sound really stupid, but, um,

49:12.515 --> 49:16.268
do you think there's anywhere
I could make money doin' karaoke?

49:16.268 --> 49:21.065
Why not? People make money
doin' all sorts of things.

49:25.110 --> 49:28.447
Did you really write letters to him in prison?

49:30.449 --> 49:32.951
Gimme a break. I was 13 years old.

49:33.576 --> 49:35.870
Who told you that? My mom?

49:36.579 --> 49:38.581
He did.

50:00.561 --> 50:02.563
You better go.

50:15.700 --> 50:19.329
That rusty nail over our front door

50:20.371 --> 50:23.833
Is where I hung our tears in a ring

50:25.293 --> 50:29.755
I threw that horseshoe into the wheat

50:30.506 --> 50:34.343
To see what love can bring

50:35.302 --> 50:39.765
Cos you're in your bed and I'm in mine

50:40.307 --> 50:44.269
On either side of town

50:45.395 --> 50:49.274
I think I might take a ride...

51:00.618 --> 51:02.828
Please... Please don't get mad.

51:06.165 --> 51:09.501
One night. One night and I'm gone.

51:11.587 --> 51:13.964
They're not gonna lock me up, are they?

51:14.381 --> 51:19.177
Teena, how the fuck do I know what they're
gonna do? I'm sick of watchin' you fuck up.

51:19.302 --> 51:23.473
But... but I'm not fuckin' up.
It is so good down there, Lonny.

51:23.473 --> 51:27.936
In Falls City? They hang faggots
down there. Did you know that?

51:28.061 --> 51:30.563
You've never even been there. Look.

51:32.231 --> 51:34.609
Look. See, isn't she beautiful?

51:35.651 --> 51:38.070
If you like white trash.

51:38.070 --> 51:40.156
I'm gonna ask her to marry me.

51:42.241 --> 51:46.829
Before or after your sex-change operation?
Before or after you tell her you're a girl?

51:46.829 --> 51:48.497
Shut up!

51:48.497 --> 51:51.291
It's... it's different. It's workin'.

51:51.625 --> 51:55.045
I'm not gonna fuck it up this time.

51:57.672 --> 51:59.841
I hope they do lock you up tomorrow.

52:02.052 --> 52:07.348
Keith Pierce, for spray-paintin' and
smashin' 50 new cars, you are sentenced

52:07.473 --> 52:11.018
to six months at the
juvenile detention centre.

52:11.727 --> 52:13.729
Teena Brandon.

52:16.023 --> 52:19.443
Teena Brandon, docket 72391.

52:24.031 --> 52:29.036
Teena Brandon, docket 7 2391,
grand theft auto.

53:22.754 --> 53:25.256
Psst! Lana! Down here!

53:26.716 --> 53:30.052
Brandon! Where'd you get that?

53:30.553 --> 53:32.555
Nice hat.

53:36.600 --> 53:38.894
I gotta go. My break's almost over.

53:56.327 --> 53:59.038
It all looks so different from the outside.

54:16.555 --> 54:18.640
Oh, you're so pretty.

54:49.086 --> 54:51.380
I feel like I'm in a trance.

54:55.551 --> 54:57.511
Am I goin' too fast?

56:32.935 --> 56:35.855
I cannot wear these. They make me look fat.

56:36.272 --> 56:38.357
Quit changin' the subject.

56:39.608 --> 56:42.111
I saved your ass at work.
Now tell us what's goin' on.

56:42.194 --> 56:45.447
Yeah, I bet Brandon doesn't think you're fat.

56:45.531 --> 56:50.118
- Nobody looks fat when they're layin' down.
- I knew it! I fuckin' knew it!

56:55.040 --> 56:58.793
- We just drove around, takin' pictures.
- Yeah, right.

57:21.940 --> 57:25.694
Oh, I cannot talk about it!
It's too intense.

57:25.777 --> 57:28.613
Come on, Lana! I can't take it!

58:17.410 --> 58:19.370
Are you OK?

58:21.372 --> 58:22.415
Yeah.

58:28.963 --> 58:30.965
Are you OK?

58:31.590 --> 58:33.342
Yeah.

58:33.467 --> 58:36.595
I mean, uh... I don't know.

59:06.415 --> 59:08.709
You're so handsome.

59:27.268 --> 59:30.396
And then we took off our clothes
and went swimmin'.

59:36.861 --> 59:39.155
Don't be scared, Brandon.

59:46.870 --> 59:48.831
But did you do it?

59:48.956 --> 59:50.916
What do you think?

01:00:08.224 --> 01:00:12.520
- What did you wish for?
- I know what he wished for. Yeah, baby!

01:00:12.603 --> 01:00:15.439
Oh, Mom, don't talk so gross!

01:00:19.485 --> 01:00:23.155
- Happy birthday.
- You shouldn't have, really.

01:00:30.871 --> 01:00:33.165
Keepin' me strong, Mom?

01:00:33.456 --> 01:00:35.333
Happy birthday, sweetheart.

01:00:35.458 --> 01:00:38.461
- Thank you, Mom.
- Sorry, I forgot mine.

01:00:40.672 --> 01:00:43.883
- That's OK.
- I haven't wrapped mine yet.

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.054
- Hey, grease monkey.
- How ya doin'?

01:00:48.179 --> 01:00:51.599
We were doin' a job in Omaha.
We could've used a lookout.

01:00:56.604 --> 01:01:01.608
John Lotter, I know your mother, and
I know she taught you how to knock.

01:01:01.733 --> 01:01:05.487
We could've been lyin' around
here naked, for all you know.

01:01:05.570 --> 01:01:07.239
- Where's Lana?
- In her room.

01:01:07.656 --> 01:01:12.577
Come on, get a beer, John.
It's Brandon's birthday. Sit with us.

01:01:21.210 --> 01:01:23.212
Hey, gorgeous.

01:01:23.921 --> 01:01:25.923
Walk right in, why don't you?

01:01:26.007 --> 01:01:30.511
- I'm busy fixin' my hair.
- Your hair's beautiful. I love your hair.

01:01:33.305 --> 01:01:36.558
- I got this for you up in Omaha.
- Cool.

01:01:39.353 --> 01:01:42.689
Tom and I went up to Lincoln
for a couple of days.

01:01:43.315 --> 01:01:45.108
Stealin' cars?

01:01:51.865 --> 01:01:55.618
I came by the factory before we left
and you weren't there.

01:01:56.661 --> 01:01:58.663
So?

01:02:01.249 --> 01:02:03.251
Nice.

01:02:09.590 --> 01:02:12.509
- Don't get upset. I just wanna talk.
- About what?

01:02:12.634 --> 01:02:16.054
About you and Brandon.
I'm just lookin' out for ya.

01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.599
What are you talkin' about?
He's your friend, too.

01:02:23.061 --> 01:02:25.146
I miss you.

01:02:25.230 --> 01:02:27.732
- I do.
- Stop it, John. You give me the creeps.

01:02:27.857 --> 01:02:30.985
- You're like a stalker.
- Fuck you!

01:02:33.696 --> 01:02:36.699
- No. No. Fuck you.
- John, I'm sorry.

01:02:36.824 --> 01:02:39.202
I just need some privacy right now.

01:02:40.244 --> 01:02:42.038
Yeah.

01:02:42.121 --> 01:02:44.540
You know I just wanna protect you.

01:02:45.875 --> 01:02:48.168
I know.

01:02:48.294 --> 01:02:50.796
No one's ever protected me like you.

01:02:56.510 --> 01:02:58.595
What do you see in him?

01:02:59.221 --> 01:03:02.682
I know he's nice and everythin',
but he's kind of a wuss.

01:03:03.183 --> 01:03:07.479
I know he's no big he-man, like you.
There's just somethin' about him.

01:03:07.896 --> 01:03:11.649
Oh, yeah.
"There's just somethin' about him"!

01:03:11.733 --> 01:03:13.818
Stop makin' fun of me!

01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:21.534
- Lana, honey, are you fuckin' him?
- Goddamn it, John!

01:03:21.659 --> 01:03:24.245
- It's none of your fuckin' business!
- You are!

01:03:24.370 --> 01:03:27.581
Excuse me. Did I interrupt somethin'?

01:03:30.083 --> 01:03:32.085
Lana, are you OK?

01:03:32.711 --> 01:03:34.880
Don't even think about it, John.

01:03:41.052 --> 01:03:45.306
- John, let's hit the road, man.
- No. It's Brandon's birthday.

01:03:48.643 --> 01:03:50.937
She's beautiful, isn't she?

01:03:51.562 --> 01:03:55.024
Oh, man. I've known her
since she was like this high.

01:03:56.275 --> 01:03:58.777
I could tell you stories about her.

01:04:00.029 --> 01:04:02.531
You know what kind of stories?

01:04:05.659 --> 01:04:07.828
She told me about you guys.

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:17.003
And I can't think of a better guy to give
Lana to than you, so happy birthday!

01:04:19.506 --> 01:04:21.508
Thanks, John.

01:04:23.468 --> 01:04:29.515
You know, just one thing you gotta
remember, little man, is this is my house.

01:04:34.228 --> 01:04:36.188
Come on, turn up the music!

01:04:37.231 --> 01:04:39.233
Turn up the music!

01:05:24.985 --> 01:05:26.570
I quit.

01:05:26.653 --> 01:05:29.155
- Quit what?
- My evil job.

01:05:30.740 --> 01:05:34.786
I've just been thinkin' and thinkin',
what am I doin' here?

01:05:34.786 --> 01:05:38.331
And then it came to me...
I'll go to Memphis with you.

01:05:38.456 --> 01:05:41.584
- Memphis?
- I got it all figured out.

01:05:41.667 --> 01:05:44.712
You're right.
I'll make money singin' karaoke...

01:05:44.795 --> 01:05:47.214
- Lana...
- You'll manage me,

01:05:47.298 --> 01:05:51.051
and, if I'm no good, you'll sing
and I'll manage you. Perfect.

01:05:54.596 --> 01:05:57.015
Nothin' can go wrong if we're together.

01:05:57.933 --> 01:06:03.563
Lana, um... it's a little more complicated
than that, you know? Memphis is far.

01:06:03.688 --> 01:06:06.816
It's 1,327 miles.

01:06:07.651 --> 01:06:09.402
Yeah,

01:06:09.527 --> 01:06:12.113
but, you know, I been thinkin'.

01:06:12.655 --> 01:06:17.326
We could just start our own trailer park
right here in Falls City.

01:06:20.663 --> 01:06:24.625
- You don't wanna go with me?
- No! Of course I do!

01:06:24.750 --> 01:06:27.253
That's the point. I'll marry you right now.

01:06:28.712 --> 01:06:31.006
Oh, Lana... you're in trouble again.

01:06:32.758 --> 01:06:36.511
Actually, that ain't Lana's, it's mine.
I'll take care of it.

01:06:36.637 --> 01:06:38.930
I just got my first paycheck.

01:06:39.639 --> 01:06:41.933
Come on, now. You go sit down.

01:06:42.058 --> 01:06:43.935
- OK.
- I'll bring your breakfast.

01:06:45.687 --> 01:06:49.566
The thing about the trailer park
is we'll have picnic tables

01:06:49.649 --> 01:06:53.528
and people playin' music,
and barbecues every night.

01:06:53.611 --> 01:06:57.281
We'll invite our friends:
Candace, Kate, your mom.

01:06:57.365 --> 01:07:01.118
Heck, even John,
if you two don't kill each other first.

01:07:03.204 --> 01:07:06.665
And best of all, we'll have our own Airstream.

01:07:18.134 --> 01:07:21.554
If that's a hassle, you could
mail the receipt to my house.

01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:25.642
That's all right. I'll just be
a moment. I'll be right back.

01:07:32.607 --> 01:07:34.817
Just one second.

01:07:36.152 --> 01:07:38.154
It's slow.

01:07:43.993 --> 01:07:45.953
Miss Brandon?

01:07:50.749 --> 01:07:55.545
Miss Brandon, we put your Charles Brayman
ID number through the computer yesterday,

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:59.841
and this is what the Lincoln
authorities faxed us over.

01:08:06.806 --> 01:08:08.808
You tell me.

01:08:10.685 --> 01:08:12.228
Wow.

01:08:12.353 --> 01:08:15.356
This Teena chick seems pretty messed up.

01:08:19.443 --> 01:08:21.319
What the hell is this?

01:08:24.448 --> 01:08:28.410
- Who wrote this?
- That guy who stayed with you. Brandon.

01:09:16.038 --> 01:09:19.082
Dear Lonny, I bet you can't guess where I am.

01:09:20.126 --> 01:09:22.837
That's right, back in jail, in Falls City.

01:09:24.589 --> 01:09:26.590
I'm so tired of fuckin' up.

01:09:26.674 --> 01:09:31.804
I'm tryin' to stay strong, but I don't know
if I can face all the mistakes I've made.

01:09:43.356 --> 01:09:45.358
I'm stayin' tough.

01:09:54.409 --> 01:09:55.660
No!

01:10:15.596 --> 01:10:18.807
Candace... why do you look so funny?

01:10:34.572 --> 01:10:37.158
Lana! Lana, what are you doin' here?

01:10:39.243 --> 01:10:41.245
What are you doin' here?

01:10:41.328 --> 01:10:43.330
The girls' cell?

01:10:43.414 --> 01:10:46.959
This place is crazy.
It's, like, put you wherever they want.

01:10:46.959 --> 01:10:49.461
It's fine with me, I guess, but...

01:10:50.003 --> 01:10:54.883
Julie, give us a break, man. Watch
the rest of the show. Tell us how it ends.

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.513
We only got three channels. I hate it.

01:11:01.056 --> 01:11:02.724
Brandon, what's goin' on?

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:06.561
You want the truth, don't ya?

01:11:08.438 --> 01:11:11.566
It sounds a lot more complicated than it is.

01:11:14.193 --> 01:11:18.781
Do you have any water?
Cos I'm really... My voice is... dry.

01:11:24.620 --> 01:11:26.705
I'm a hermaphrodite.

01:11:26.789 --> 01:11:27.956
What?

01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:30.042
Come here.

01:11:32.961 --> 01:11:37.424
It's a person who has both...
girl and boy parts.

01:11:38.258 --> 01:11:40.760
Brandon's real name is Teena Brandon.

01:11:42.428 --> 01:11:45.348
Well, see, Brandon's not quite a he.

01:11:46.391 --> 01:11:50.269
- Brandon's more like a sh...
- Shut up. It's your business.

01:11:50.353 --> 01:11:55.357
Look, I don't care if you're half monkey
or half ape. I'm gettin' you outta here.

01:12:21.633 --> 01:12:23.843
I would say I'm sorry

01:12:23.926 --> 01:12:27.471
If I thought that it would change your mind

01:12:27.597 --> 01:12:29.265
But I know that this time...

01:12:29.348 --> 01:12:31.559
Candace,

01:12:31.642 --> 01:12:33.936
I spoke to Lana's mom.

01:12:35.104 --> 01:12:37.064
She's missin'.

01:12:37.189 --> 01:12:40.317
- You know where she is?
- I don't know. I swear.

01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:43.737
Candace, if you know anythin',
you better tell me now.

01:12:43.862 --> 01:12:46.031
You know what?

01:12:46.031 --> 01:12:49.701
I already opened my big mouth,
and now no one's talkin' to me.

01:12:49.784 --> 01:12:51.870
Candace, I'm talkin' to ya.

01:13:00.003 --> 01:13:02.422
Either I'm fucked up,

01:13:02.505 --> 01:13:05.424
or something's totally weird.

01:13:06.467 --> 01:13:09.929
Come on, Kandi. You can tell me.
I won't tell anybody.

01:13:11.597 --> 01:13:14.183
- I need more to drink.
- There you go.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.393
I try to laugh about it

01:13:16.477 --> 01:13:19.938
Hidin' the tears in my eyes, cos

01:13:20.772 --> 01:13:23.984
Boys don't cry

01:13:25.569 --> 01:13:30.782
Boys don't cry

01:13:31.616 --> 01:13:34.619
I would tell you that I loved you

01:13:34.744 --> 01:13:37.747
If I thought that you would stay

01:13:37.872 --> 01:13:40.791
But I know that it's no use

01:13:40.875 --> 01:13:43.586
You already gone away

01:13:44.337 --> 01:13:46.297
Missed out your limits

01:13:47.339 --> 01:13:49.008
Pushed you too far

01:13:50.384 --> 01:13:52.344
Took you for granted...

01:14:00.685 --> 01:14:05.065
Goddamn it! I wanna touch you
the way you touch me.

01:14:07.275 --> 01:14:09.360
No. Wait.

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:11.529
Fuck you, Brandon!

01:14:11.654 --> 01:14:13.614
Fuck you!

01:14:13.740 --> 01:14:15.825
I want you to feel what I feel.

01:14:19.662 --> 01:14:22.164
Lana, wait. Wait.

01:14:24.458 --> 01:14:26.669
Soon. I promise.

01:14:30.089 --> 01:14:32.508
- Is she back yet?
- No, and I'm worried.

01:14:32.591 --> 01:14:35.927
- Come on, let's just go find Lana.
- He'll show up.

01:14:36.053 --> 01:14:38.972
Kate, I want you to tell me what's goin' on.

01:14:39.389 --> 01:14:41.141
Mom, you read the paper today?

01:14:41.766 --> 01:14:43.643
- No.
- Candace, show Mom the paper.

01:14:43.643 --> 01:14:47.313
- John, you promised.
- Come on. Is Lana your friend or not?

01:14:47.397 --> 01:14:49.482
Just gimme that, honey.

01:14:51.150 --> 01:14:54.278
"Teena Brandon, 19,
picked up on a speeding violation."

01:14:54.403 --> 01:14:56.280
So? Brandon got a ticket.

01:14:56.364 --> 01:14:58.366
The name, Mom. The name.

01:15:03.662 --> 01:15:06.081
He's brainwashed her. That's what they do.

01:15:06.165 --> 01:15:10.127
Get out! There's nothin' in Lana's room.
John, leave her stuff alone.

01:15:10.252 --> 01:15:15.257
I'm not touchin' her stuff! If you were any
kind of mother, this wouldn't have happened.

01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:19.010
- I told you you couldn't trust him.
- You never told me anythin'.

01:15:19.094 --> 01:15:22.138
Come on, Kate, you got to stop this.

01:15:22.222 --> 01:15:27.435
Like you wouldn't jump in if it wasn't
totally obvious you're in love with Brandon!

01:15:30.563 --> 01:15:34.025
Holy fuckin' mother of fuck!
Tom, check this out.

01:15:37.236 --> 01:15:40.990
"Cross-Dressers and Transsexuals:
The Uninvited Dilemma."

01:15:42.157 --> 01:15:43.909
"Sexual identity crisis."

01:15:44.034 --> 01:15:47.871
Jesus fuckin' Christ, Tom,
check this out... OK, look at this.

01:15:47.996 --> 01:15:51.208
"The grafted skin will mimic
the skin of the natural penis."

01:15:51.333 --> 01:15:53.627
Get this sick shit away from me!

01:15:53.710 --> 01:15:55.712
Just give it a minute, OK?

01:15:56.629 --> 01:15:59.048
She's gotta think I was at work.

01:15:59.549 --> 01:16:01.551
OK.

01:16:01.968 --> 01:16:03.928
But I'll miss you.

01:16:26.450 --> 01:16:28.952
- Whoa!
- Thank God you're home.

01:16:29.494 --> 01:16:31.663
Did you party all night without me?

01:16:31.788 --> 01:16:33.248
Come on in, have a beer.

01:16:33.331 --> 01:16:38.545
Look, I gotta take a shower. I don't mean
to be antisocial, but I'm really tired, guys.

01:16:38.670 --> 01:16:42.632
- How was work, Lana?
- Oh, you know, whatever, Mom. The usual.

01:16:46.469 --> 01:16:49.096
Mom, what the hell's goin' on?

01:16:51.265 --> 01:16:53.559
God, what did you tell them?

01:16:54.184 --> 01:16:57.438
We called work. We know you weren't there.

01:16:57.521 --> 01:17:02.025
Why is he talkin' to me?
What are you? My dad?

01:17:03.777 --> 01:17:06.279
Why are you all starin' at me?

01:17:07.322 --> 01:17:11.701
Get away! You're gross! You're
horrible people! Get outta my room!

01:17:11.701 --> 01:17:14.329
We're worried. We're just tryin' to save you.

01:17:14.621 --> 01:17:16.497
You got a sick way of showin' it.

01:17:16.623 --> 01:17:19.834
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey... Oh, my God!

01:17:21.502 --> 01:17:24.547
Brandon, turn around and go, now.
This is a nuthouse.

01:17:24.630 --> 01:17:27.341
- I'm just worried about you.
- Stop with that!

01:17:27.466 --> 01:17:30.678
- We just need to talk.
- What do you need to talk about?

01:17:30.803 --> 01:17:33.389
There are some things I don't understand.

01:17:33.514 --> 01:17:37.976
You took a leak with me and... pardon my
French, Mom, but... you shook off your dick.

01:17:37.976 --> 01:17:41.730
And what was that bullshit
about payin' child support for a kid?

01:17:41.855 --> 01:17:46.234
- You been lyin' since you came into town.
- No...

01:17:46.318 --> 01:17:49.571
When you rode in on your
pussy-whipped faggot horse.

01:17:49.654 --> 01:17:53.950
The fact is, little dude,
you're nothin' but a goddamn liar.

01:17:54.033 --> 01:17:55.827
You know what we do to liars?

01:17:55.910 --> 01:17:58.329
There was never any Memphis, was there?

01:17:58.621 --> 01:18:02.083
We're totally fuckin' with you! Seriously!

01:18:03.417 --> 01:18:05.419
Go get Brandon a beer.

01:18:06.962 --> 01:18:10.841
We were wonderin' about this paper
that you are in, Teena.

01:18:16.972 --> 01:18:19.599
It's our ticket. They're hungry for news here.

01:18:19.683 --> 01:18:23.353
Yeah, but what I'm
wonderin' about is the name.

01:18:24.813 --> 01:18:27.732
Huh, Brandon? I mean, huh, Teena?

01:18:27.815 --> 01:18:29.692
I really fucked up.

01:18:29.817 --> 01:18:33.988
I borrowed one of Candace's cheques
and I got that ticket and this fake ID.

01:18:34.071 --> 01:18:36.490
I guess I just need to learn to stay home.

01:18:36.574 --> 01:18:41.495
Brandon, I invite you into my home and
you expose my daughter to your sickness.

01:18:41.579 --> 01:18:45.749
- Did you ever think about Lana?
- That's all I've been thinkin' about.

01:18:45.874 --> 01:18:49.419
You know, Lana, if you are a lesbian,
you just need to tell me.

01:18:49.503 --> 01:18:53.256
- John, I'm not. Mom, it's not...
- Stop it. It's not Lana. It's me.

01:18:53.382 --> 01:18:58.386
Lana, I'm so sorry. Mom, wait, I can explain.
We can work this out. I have this thing...

01:18:58.470 --> 01:19:01.514
You fuckin' pervert.
Are you a girl or are you not?

01:19:01.598 --> 01:19:03.475
Are you a girl or are you not?

01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:05.768
There's a real easy way to solve this.

01:19:05.894 --> 01:19:08.688
- Fuck you! Get the fuck off of me.
- You want a fight?

01:19:08.813 --> 01:19:13.276
- Get out of here with your sick psycho brain!
- I could kill you for lyin' to Lana.

01:19:13.401 --> 01:19:17.154
John, there's not gonna be
any killin' goin' on, OK?

01:19:19.532 --> 01:19:24.536
Do you trust me enough to let
Brandon show me?  Then I'll tell you.

01:19:25.621 --> 01:19:27.623
Do you trust me enough?

01:19:30.834 --> 01:19:32.627
OK, John?

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:35.630
Yeah.

01:19:36.673 --> 01:19:38.341
OK.

01:19:38.466 --> 01:19:40.426
Thank you, guys.

01:19:42.512 --> 01:19:44.305
Fuck me!

01:19:44.389 --> 01:19:46.391
Holy fuck!

01:19:47.225 --> 01:19:49.518
Get over here. I'm so sorry, Brandon.

01:19:49.602 --> 01:19:51.687
Lana... I gotta explain.

01:19:51.812 --> 01:19:55.649
Oh, no, no, no. Button up your pants.
Don't show me anythin'.

01:19:56.609 --> 01:19:58.485
Think about it.

01:19:58.569 --> 01:20:00.446
I know you're a guy.

01:20:00.446 --> 01:20:05.450
OK, but you gotta listen. I was born
with this weirdness, like a birth defect.

01:20:05.575 --> 01:20:09.329
It's actually not that rare,
but these doctors are tryin' to fix it.

01:20:09.412 --> 01:20:11.623
But I have really weird stuff, too.

01:20:13.083 --> 01:20:15.043
Don't be scared.

01:20:16.294 --> 01:20:18.379
Look how beautiful it is out there.

01:20:18.504 --> 01:20:21.924
- Oh, Lana...
- That's us. We can beam ourselves out there.

01:20:25.261 --> 01:20:27.471
So what are you gonna tell 'em?

01:20:27.555 --> 01:20:30.391
I'm gonna tell 'em what they wanna hear.

01:20:30.683 --> 01:20:33.519
I'm gonna tell 'em what we know is true.

01:20:45.697 --> 01:20:47.699
Mom,

01:20:49.034 --> 01:20:51.327
I seen him in the full flesh.

01:20:52.078 --> 01:20:54.247
I seen it.

01:20:54.372 --> 01:20:56.332
I know he's a man.

01:20:57.292 --> 01:21:00.086
Problem done. Now let's go to bed.

01:21:01.879 --> 01:21:04.173
Son of a bitch!
What have you done to my baby?

01:21:04.257 --> 01:21:06.884
What the fuck are you, you motherfucker?!

01:21:06.967 --> 01:21:08.427
Huh?

01:21:09.053 --> 01:21:10.846
Tell me!

01:21:17.394 --> 01:21:19.396
You little liar.

01:21:20.022 --> 01:21:21.898
Kate, get her outta here.

01:21:21.982 --> 01:21:23.984
Come on.

01:21:28.863 --> 01:21:31.783
All I need is the truth, little buddy. Come on.

01:21:34.619 --> 01:21:37.830
All right... I'm sorry to put you
through this. Wait...

01:21:38.039 --> 01:21:39.916
- Unstrap his belt.
- I'll do it!

01:21:40.041 --> 01:21:43.044
Tom, just turn the light off. I'll do it! Please!

01:21:43.044 --> 01:21:45.129
Fuck! John, let me the fuck go!

01:21:45.254 --> 01:21:49.008
What's goin' on in there? Open the door!

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.470
Open the fuckin' door!

01:21:57.557 --> 01:21:59.935
- John, please! Please!
- What do you see?

01:22:00.060 --> 01:22:02.562
If it's down here, it's the tiniest I ever saw!

01:22:02.646 --> 01:22:07.025
- Touch it.
- Oh, goddamn it, I can't! God, I can't do it!

01:22:07.025 --> 01:22:09.027
What the fuck are you?!

01:22:09.110 --> 01:22:11.195
Come on. Come on. Come on.

01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:14.240
Let me go! John, let me go!

01:22:18.202 --> 01:22:20.162
Open the door!

01:22:23.499 --> 01:22:26.418
Don't look like no sexual identity crisis to me.

01:22:29.755 --> 01:22:32.174
- Open the door!
- Get in here.

01:22:33.925 --> 01:22:36.845
Look at your little boyfriend.
Look at your little boyfriend.

01:22:40.515 --> 01:22:43.518
Come on, I'm holdin' you until you look.

01:22:43.643 --> 01:22:45.186
Look!

01:22:45.186 --> 01:22:47.063
Leave him alone!

01:23:03.454 --> 01:23:06.039
- Leave him alone!
- Him?

01:23:06.165 --> 01:23:08.125
Him?!

01:23:09.501 --> 01:23:12.087
- Get outta my house!
- John, we called the cops.

01:23:12.212 --> 01:23:15.757
- Go on. Get out.
- You are just too fucked up!

01:23:16.466 --> 01:23:18.760
Leave us alone!

01:23:18.885 --> 01:23:23.973
- Leave me alone. Please, just leave me alone!
- You promised... You promised...

01:23:39.613 --> 01:23:42.449
I guess that's everythin'.

01:23:43.158 --> 01:23:47.871
You know, I told Brandon...
that nobody has a right to do that to you.

01:23:50.040 --> 01:23:53.376
Come on, we've done everythin' we can.
Let's get outta here.

01:23:53.585 --> 01:23:56.212
- Let's go.
- I'm waitin' for Brandon.

01:23:57.464 --> 01:24:00.592
Your mom's right.
Until this is straightened out,

01:24:00.675 --> 01:24:05.054
it'd be better for everyone
if Brandon stays someplace else.

01:24:05.179 --> 01:24:09.141
What are you talkin' about?
lt'd be better to lock up Tom and John.

01:24:09.225 --> 01:24:12.686
Lana, everythin' Teena told us was lies.

01:24:12.770 --> 01:24:15.064
Everythin'. Everythin'.

01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:19.151
We need to go.

01:24:19.234 --> 01:24:21.236
Now.

01:24:21.320 --> 01:24:23.322
Come on!

01:24:23.405 --> 01:24:25.407
Come on. Get up!

01:24:26.950 --> 01:24:30.078
I'm askin' you this
because if this goes to court

01:24:30.203 --> 01:24:34.374
that question's gonna come up
and I'm gonna want an answer.

01:24:34.999 --> 01:24:36.543
Uh, I don't know why I have to...

01:24:36.668 --> 01:24:38.628
All right, let's back up.

01:24:38.753 --> 01:24:42.089
After they pulled your pants down
and seen you was a girl,

01:24:42.590 --> 01:24:45.635
what did he do? Did he fondle you any?

01:24:51.765 --> 01:24:53.767
No.

01:25:04.277 --> 01:25:07.113
Didn't that kinda get
your attention somehow?

01:25:08.657 --> 01:25:13.453
That he wouldn't put his hand in your pants
and just play with you a little bit?

01:25:15.455 --> 01:25:16.998
I don't know what he did.

01:25:26.382 --> 01:25:28.467
Let's go. Come on.

01:25:30.260 --> 01:25:34.014
Let's go, buddy.
Come on, let's go for a ride. Move!

01:25:37.559 --> 01:25:41.813
I can't believe that he pulled your pants
down, and if you are a female,

01:25:41.938 --> 01:25:45.483
that he didn't stick
his hand in ya or his finger in ya.

01:25:46.526 --> 01:25:47.861
Well, he didn't.

01:26:04.543 --> 01:26:06.545
Get outta the car.

01:26:06.629 --> 01:26:08.922
Get outta the car. Come on.

01:26:11.425 --> 01:26:13.510
- John...
- Shut up. Move!

01:26:13.635 --> 01:26:15.095
- Wait, John.
- Shut up.

01:26:15.178 --> 01:26:18.223
- John, it's me. Brandon. You know me.
- Shut up.

01:26:18.306 --> 01:26:20.809
- Don't hurt me.
- Take off your shirt.

01:26:20.934 --> 01:26:24.979
You know you brought this on yourself,
Teena. Tom, get out the car!

01:26:26.439 --> 01:26:29.901
- I'm...
- Take off your shirt. Take off your shirt.

01:26:29.984 --> 01:26:33.946
You can make this easy, or you can
get the shit knocked outta you.

01:26:34.071 --> 01:26:36.032
All right...

01:26:41.870 --> 01:26:47.209
Please, John, wait. Please...
We can work this out. Please.

01:26:47.292 --> 01:26:49.294
Get off me. Get off!

01:26:50.420 --> 01:26:53.131
Wait, John. Please. Please don't hurt me.

01:26:53.131 --> 01:26:55.842
After you had your pants off,

01:26:57.093 --> 01:26:59.804
how were you positioned in the back seat?

01:27:00.847 --> 01:27:02.432
On my back.

01:27:02.515 --> 01:27:04.517
You was on your back?

01:27:06.811 --> 01:27:10.022
You say you're 21 and you've
never had sex before. Correct?

01:27:10.356 --> 01:27:12.525
That's right.

01:27:13.150 --> 01:27:15.361
When they had a spread of ya,

01:27:15.444 --> 01:27:17.446
when they poked ya,

01:27:17.530 --> 01:27:20.240
where'd they try to pop it in first?

01:27:20.783 --> 01:27:23.285
I said move your fuckin' hands!

01:27:26.496 --> 01:27:28.498
My vagina.

01:27:28.582 --> 01:27:30.584
Where?

01:27:31.293 --> 01:27:33.295
My vagina.

01:27:43.513 --> 01:27:45.473
Go ahead, man. Take it.

01:27:56.942 --> 01:27:58.944
Come on. Come on.

01:27:59.027 --> 01:28:01.029
Get up there. Get up!

01:28:02.698 --> 01:28:04.658
Take this fuckin' thing off.

01:28:07.160 --> 01:28:09.162
Take this fuckin' thing off.

01:28:18.838 --> 01:28:20.840
No!

01:29:37.872 --> 01:29:40.166
Come on, buddy. Let's go.

01:29:48.924 --> 01:29:51.009
- You OK?
- Yeah.

01:30:00.101 --> 01:30:03.229
Just... just take me home, OK?

01:30:05.607 --> 01:30:09.485
If you keep our little secret,
we'll stay friends. Right, little buddy?

01:30:09.569 --> 01:30:13.322
Cos if you don't...
we'll have to silence you permanently.

01:30:16.033 --> 01:30:20.412
Yeah. Yeah, of course.
I mean, this is all my fault. I know.

01:30:34.176 --> 01:30:36.595
You OK in there, little dude?

01:30:37.429 --> 01:30:38.888
Yeah!

01:30:39.514 --> 01:30:41.474
I'm fine!

01:30:54.403 --> 01:30:56.489
I'm gettin' a beer. You want one?

01:30:56.614 --> 01:30:58.073
No.

01:30:59.742 --> 01:31:03.370
Make sure you get yourself
cleaned up in there.

01:31:03.996 --> 01:31:06.290
Will you need any help?

01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:11.920
No! I'm good!

01:31:21.846 --> 01:31:24.432
You almost ready in there, little dude?

01:31:25.808 --> 01:31:27.476
Gimme a break, man!

01:31:28.603 --> 01:31:30.604
Gimme two fuckin' seconds!

01:31:34.567 --> 01:31:36.527
Tom! Tom!

01:31:51.541 --> 01:31:53.626
Oh, my God! Brandon!

01:31:56.045 --> 01:31:58.339
What are you doin' here?

01:31:58.840 --> 01:32:01.342
Mom, stop it! He's hurt!

01:32:05.096 --> 01:32:06.764
Lana...

01:32:06.889 --> 01:32:09.266
I don't want it in the house.

01:32:09.892 --> 01:32:11.894
Lana...

01:32:12.394 --> 01:32:14.813
Mom, stop it. He's hurt!

01:32:14.897 --> 01:32:16.899
I'm sorry.

01:32:18.358 --> 01:32:20.736
Call an ambulance! Now!

01:32:28.868 --> 01:32:30.870
OK, almost.

01:32:42.423 --> 01:32:44.717
So they assaulted you?

01:32:50.973 --> 01:32:53.600
If you don't mind, it's just necessary...

01:32:56.186 --> 01:32:59.231
I need for you to take your pants off, OK?

01:33:01.399 --> 01:33:03.401
Please.

01:33:03.485 --> 01:33:05.487
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:33:08.281 --> 01:33:10.700
How do you know they raped me?

01:33:34.890 --> 01:33:38.935
Why do you run around with guys,
bein' you're a girl yourself?

01:33:39.060 --> 01:33:43.940
- Why do you go around kissin' girls?
- I don't know what this has to do with...

01:33:44.065 --> 01:33:48.861
I'm tryin' to get some answers,
so I can know exactly what's goin' on.

01:33:49.988 --> 01:33:53.116
Are you gonna answer
my question for me or not?

01:33:56.994 --> 01:33:59.580
I have a sexual identity crisis.

01:34:00.414 --> 01:34:02.416
You what?

01:34:04.585 --> 01:34:06.795
A sexual identity crisis.

01:34:46.416 --> 01:34:48.377
Brandon...

01:34:48.794 --> 01:34:51.713
I just wanted to say I'm really... sorry.

01:34:54.633 --> 01:34:56.635
Oh, my God!

01:34:57.344 --> 01:34:59.637
What did they do to you?

01:35:00.680 --> 01:35:03.391
Oh, my God. Come in here. Come in.

01:35:05.059 --> 01:35:06.519
Go inside.

01:36:04.616 --> 01:36:08.995
That is a bunch of bull.
If I wanted to rape somebody, I got Mallory.

01:36:11.915 --> 01:36:13.875
Listen, John.

01:36:14.209 --> 01:36:17.837
I'm just here to tell you
that it's been reported.

01:36:17.962 --> 01:36:23.259
Listen to me. So if you did anythin',
or anythin' happened in that room,

01:36:23.884 --> 01:36:25.886
you get it cleaned up.

01:36:40.150 --> 01:36:44.946
We went out, um... muddin' last night,
and we got stuck in a ditch.

01:36:47.365 --> 01:36:51.202
- Seriously.
- Why is she fuckin' makin' lies like that?

01:36:57.166 --> 01:36:59.126
Seriously!

01:37:00.711 --> 01:37:02.671
You want a beer?

01:37:05.591 --> 01:37:07.801
- No, no, no.
- Oh, come on.

01:37:07.885 --> 01:37:09.887
You take care, John.

01:37:10.804 --> 01:37:13.432
I'll come back later. We'll play cards.

01:37:13.515 --> 01:37:16.852
Why don't you just give it
a few days, all right?

01:37:16.977 --> 01:37:18.937
OK.

01:37:24.150 --> 01:37:26.778
God, you're such a stupid fuckin' pussy!

01:37:26.861 --> 01:37:28.863
What, man? You're paranoid.

01:37:28.947 --> 01:37:32.408
She came here to warn us.
She ain't gonna say nothin'.

01:37:33.242 --> 01:37:35.203
Hello?

01:37:36.037 --> 01:37:37.496
Yes, sir.

01:37:37.622 --> 01:37:39.582
No, sir.

01:37:39.790 --> 01:37:42.418
Yes, sir. Tomorrow mornin'.

01:37:42.501 --> 01:37:44.503
Yeah, we'll come by.

01:37:44.587 --> 01:37:47.423
We have to go by the station
tomorrow mornin'.

01:38:24.416 --> 01:38:26.627
Can I come sit by you?

01:38:45.895 --> 01:38:47.897
Do you hate me?

01:38:53.194 --> 01:38:55.196
Do you need anythin'?

01:39:09.042 --> 01:39:11.044
God!

01:39:13.129 --> 01:39:15.090
You're so pretty!

01:39:22.096 --> 01:39:24.807
You're just sayin' that cos you like me.

01:39:24.891 --> 01:39:26.893
No!

01:39:43.784 --> 01:39:45.869
What were you like

01:39:46.703 --> 01:39:48.663
before all this?

01:39:50.957 --> 01:39:53.376
Were you like me? Like a girl girl?

01:39:56.921 --> 01:39:58.881
Yeah.

01:40:00.133 --> 01:40:02.134
Like a long time ago.

01:40:04.637 --> 01:40:07.431
And then I guess I was just like a boy girl.

01:40:08.599 --> 01:40:10.559
And then I was just a jerk.

01:40:15.773 --> 01:40:17.774
It's weird.

01:40:19.109 --> 01:40:21.528
Finally everythin' felt right.

01:40:27.575 --> 01:40:29.869
Boy, that's pretty weird, huh?

01:40:30.370 --> 01:40:32.372
Yep.

01:40:34.540 --> 01:40:37.460
That dream I had? The first night?

01:40:39.337 --> 01:40:41.339
We were on the highway together.

01:40:43.299 --> 01:40:45.301
We can still do it.

01:40:48.429 --> 01:40:50.389
Lana... l, um...

01:40:52.266 --> 01:40:57.187
Look, I never been on the highway
or the Grand Canyon, or any place like that.

01:40:57.896 --> 01:41:00.816
Until I came here,
I never even been outta Lincoln.

01:41:01.566 --> 01:41:03.526
I never even met my dad.

01:41:04.361 --> 01:41:08.948
He died before I was born,
and my sister ain't no model in Hollywood.

01:41:26.882 --> 01:41:29.593
I don't know if I'm gonna know how to do it.

01:41:29.718 --> 01:41:32.095
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

01:42:19.766 --> 01:42:22.060
Um, I was wonderin'

01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:25.897
if you wanna come home
to Lincoln with me.

01:42:27.774 --> 01:42:30.193
My mom, she'll love you.

01:42:30.484 --> 01:42:33.320
And then you gotta meet my cousin Lonny.

01:42:33.404 --> 01:42:35.823
He's a pain, but he's great.

01:42:39.868 --> 01:42:41.870
When are we goin'?

01:42:46.333 --> 01:42:48.752
We have to leave tonight.

01:42:49.669 --> 01:42:52.088
Candace says she'll drive us.

01:42:54.049 --> 01:42:55.717
All right.

01:42:58.553 --> 01:43:00.638
I better get my stuff, then.

01:43:00.722 --> 01:43:02.307
OK.

01:43:19.281 --> 01:43:21.158
I'll be right back.

01:43:35.547 --> 01:43:37.548
Lana...

01:43:39.008 --> 01:43:41.177
Sorry.

01:43:41.803 --> 01:43:44.722
We could leave right now. It's better.

01:43:45.556 --> 01:43:47.558
OK.

01:43:48.476 --> 01:43:51.312
Don't pack too much. We'll send for it later.

01:43:52.855 --> 01:43:55.149
Tomorrow mornin'

01:43:55.274 --> 01:43:58.902
you and I will be eatin' breakfast in Lincoln.

01:44:05.283 --> 01:44:07.661
Did you do somethin' to your hair?

01:44:09.537 --> 01:44:11.539
I don't know.

01:44:12.457 --> 01:44:14.459
You like it?

01:44:14.542 --> 01:44:16.836
I don't know. I guess.

01:44:17.795 --> 01:44:20.089
I'll try and put it back.

01:44:28.514 --> 01:44:30.933
All right... we should go.

01:44:44.571 --> 01:44:46.573
It's OK, Lana.

01:44:47.282 --> 01:44:51.577
You don't have to come
with me now. There'll be time.

01:44:54.372 --> 01:44:56.791
Just make sure you get out.

01:44:56.874 --> 01:44:58.668
OK?

01:45:08.761 --> 01:45:13.557
- John, what are you doin' here?
- Where are they? Are they here?

01:45:13.974 --> 01:45:15.976
Just wait, OK?

01:45:17.436 --> 01:45:19.104
I'll be right back.

01:45:19.396 --> 01:45:21.815
Brandon ain't here.

01:45:23.566 --> 01:45:27.111
- Where is he?
- I don't know, but he ain't here.

01:45:29.197 --> 01:45:31.199
Where's Lana?

01:45:49.007 --> 01:45:50.259
Brandon's at Candace's.

01:45:50.384 --> 01:45:52.552
- What?
- He's at Candace's place.

01:46:05.815 --> 01:46:07.984
- You found him?
- Yeah.

01:46:08.609 --> 01:46:11.028
- What are you guys doin'?
- Oh, shit.

01:46:11.112 --> 01:46:13.531
Listen, you wanna go out for a drink?

01:46:13.614 --> 01:46:15.908
- No.
- Yeah! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!

01:46:31.965 --> 01:46:35.010
- Where are we goin'?
- Told you not to bring her.

01:46:35.844 --> 01:46:37.804
Stay off the main road.

01:46:40.932 --> 01:46:46.145
Think they'd recognise her
if we chopped off her head and her hands?

01:46:48.564 --> 01:46:50.441
John...

01:46:50.524 --> 01:46:54.695
We're just takin' care of a couple of dykes.
Are you one of 'em?

01:46:56.363 --> 01:46:58.574
Where'd you get that?

01:47:02.953 --> 01:47:05.747
You still plannin' on goin' to Memphis?

01:47:06.581 --> 01:47:08.166
Memphis...

01:47:30.980 --> 01:47:32.231
Why are we here?

01:47:32.356 --> 01:47:34.650
Any others in there, you take care of 'em.

01:47:34.733 --> 01:47:36.944
What are you gonna do to Candace?

01:47:37.986 --> 01:47:39.947
No! John, no!

01:47:40.072 --> 01:47:44.242
Wait! She's got a baby, John!
John, look at me. Look at me. No!

01:47:44.326 --> 01:47:46.411
Get the fuck off of me!

01:47:46.745 --> 01:47:48.622
Candace!

01:47:49.873 --> 01:47:53.293
Get the light, get the light.
Where the fuck is it?!

01:47:56.212 --> 01:47:58.089
Where the fuck is she?

01:47:58.297 --> 01:47:59.549
John...

01:47:59.966 --> 01:48:01.551
John...

01:48:02.468 --> 01:48:04.345
- Don't hurt my baby!
- Stop...

01:48:04.470 --> 01:48:05.721
Shut the fuck up!

01:48:05.805 --> 01:48:08.015
- Don't hurt Candace.
- Don't listen to her!

01:48:08.098 --> 01:48:10.100
She has nothin' to do with this!

01:48:10.184 --> 01:48:14.271
John, you were right about me.
I just keep gettin' back up.

01:48:14.354 --> 01:48:16.857
I said shut up. Shut up!

01:48:16.982 --> 01:48:18.942
Candace!

01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:22.070
- Don't listen to her!
- He said shut up.

01:48:22.195 --> 01:48:23.947
John...

01:48:27.617 --> 01:48:29.786
Teena...

01:48:29.911 --> 01:48:33.665
Please don't hurt my baby, Tom! Please!

01:48:34.582 --> 01:48:36.250
Why didn't you leave?

01:48:37.919 --> 01:48:39.712
We can still do it.

01:48:50.139 --> 01:48:51.473
No!

01:48:52.224 --> 01:48:54.601
No!

01:49:00.857 --> 01:49:05.862
Tom, don't! Please don't hurt my baby,
Tom! Please, God, please!

01:49:27.758 --> 01:49:29.551
No!

01:49:34.431 --> 01:49:35.807
Come on.

01:49:35.891 --> 01:49:37.976
Come on, Lana.

01:49:38.101 --> 01:49:40.061
Come on.

01:52:11.164 --> 01:52:15.835
Dear Lana, by the time you read this,
I'll be back home in Lincoln.

01:52:15.960 --> 01:52:20.756
I'm scared of what's ahead, but when
I think of you... I know I'll be able to go on.

01:52:22.299 --> 01:52:25.219
You were right. Memphis isn't far at all.

01:52:26.053 --> 01:52:29.390
I'll be makin' a trip out on
the highway before too long.

01:52:29.515 --> 01:52:31.475
I'll be waitin' for ya.

01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:34.519
Love always and for ever. Brandon.
