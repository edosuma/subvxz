WEBVTT

00:06.789 --> 00:08.878
Let's go, Sam!
We don't have all day!

00:08.921 --> 00:11.707
Okay, you
- literally have eternity.
- Oh, that's right.

00:11.750 --> 00:14.971
Thank you for reminding me
of my endless purgatory.

00:15.015 --> 00:16.755
Morning, Sam.

00:16.799 --> 00:19.149
Oh. Hey! Who's this
cute little guy?

00:19.193 --> 00:20.977
This is my son David.
Uh, hope it's okay.

00:21.021 --> 00:22.326
My wife's out of town
for a few days.

00:22.370 --> 00:25.503
Ugh. Why are the good ones
always married?

00:25.547 --> 00:26.678
And alive?

00:26.722 --> 00:28.071
Hurtful.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.551
Well, we're very happy
to have you, David.

00:29.594 --> 00:30.682
Welcome to the team.

00:30.726 --> 00:31.901
Should I put him on my crew?

00:31.944 --> 00:33.120
Think he's too young
to hold a hammer?

00:33.163 --> 00:34.643
Are you mad?
Children under seven

00:34.686 --> 00:36.079
aren't suitable for hard labor.

00:36.123 --> 00:37.080
Pirate!

00:37.124 --> 00:38.473
Pirate?

00:38.516 --> 00:41.084
I was a delegate of
the Second Continental Congress.

00:41.128 --> 00:44.653
- Pirate!
- Damn my ruffled
colonial garb.

00:44.696 --> 00:46.307
Uh, there's
nothing there, buddy,

00:46.350 --> 00:47.830
but I love
your imagination.

00:47.873 --> 00:49.092
And he's off.

00:50.572 --> 00:52.617
Hang on, that kid can see you?

00:52.661 --> 00:54.315
Yeah, it's rare.
But, occasionally,

00:54.358 --> 00:56.056
young children can see ghosts.

00:56.099 --> 00:58.145
Sometimes, when child
has imaginary friend,

00:58.188 --> 00:59.363
is actual ghost.

00:59.407 --> 01:01.148
Other times, kid just crazy.

01:01.191 --> 01:03.193
Once, a sweet
little girl saw my arrow

01:03.237 --> 01:04.455
and called me a
monster.

01:04.499 --> 01:05.717
- Oh.
- But it's okay.

01:05.761 --> 01:06.544
What am I gonna do?

01:06.588 --> 01:08.198
Cry myself to sleep?

01:08.242 --> 01:09.199
For weeks?

01:09.243 --> 01:10.722
- Got him.
- Oh, great.

01:10.766 --> 01:12.028
Well, we'll be back soon.

01:12.072 --> 01:13.116
We're just gonna take
a quick walk.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.726
- We?
- Yes.

01:14.770 --> 01:16.337
As in the royal we.

01:16.380 --> 01:17.555
Here <i>we</i> go,

01:17.599 --> 01:20.602
and <i>we</i> are going outside.

01:29.306 --> 01:32.048
How many of those steps
did we get today, Sam?

01:32.092 --> 01:33.571
Only 3,000.

01:33.615 --> 01:35.225
Not pointing any fingers,
but Hetty was really dragging.

01:35.269 --> 01:37.575
Well, excuse me
for dying in heels.

01:37.619 --> 01:40.404
Plus, I did not sleep. You
know I suffer from nerves.

01:40.448 --> 01:42.276
At least when I was alive,
I could take laudanum.

01:42.319 --> 01:43.712
What's laudanum?

01:43.755 --> 01:45.627
It's a simple mixture
of alcohol and morphine.

01:45.670 --> 01:47.324
You should try it, Samantha.

01:47.368 --> 01:49.457
Oh, sure, I'll pick some up
next time I'm at the alchemist.

01:49.500 --> 01:52.547
Well, I didn't always require
such elixirs.

01:52.590 --> 01:54.157
When I was a little girl,

01:54.201 --> 01:57.552
an angel-voiced servant
would sing me to sleep.

01:57.595 --> 01:58.944
Some footman or butler.

01:58.988 --> 02:00.424
His name was Gordon.

02:00.468 --> 02:01.817
I was there, as ghost.

02:01.860 --> 02:04.559
I think you're right.
It may have been Gordon.

02:04.602 --> 02:05.951
I don't know.
We paid them

02:05.995 --> 02:07.170
so we didn't have to
remember their names.

02:07.214 --> 02:08.302
Hey!

02:08.345 --> 02:10.347
There's a strange jalopy
in the driveway.

02:10.391 --> 02:11.348
Who's that?

02:11.392 --> 02:12.349
Land ship!

02:12.393 --> 02:13.524
All right.

02:13.568 --> 02:15.091
We know, baby.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.832
We know.

02:18.486 --> 02:19.704
Hey, Sam.

02:19.748 --> 02:21.141
This is
Todd Pearlman,

02:21.184 --> 02:23.534
and he's, uh...
he's some kind of historian.

02:23.578 --> 02:25.101
Historian?

02:25.145 --> 02:28.452
Well, I think we know
where this is going.

02:28.496 --> 02:31.063
Welcome, Todd. What
brings you to our house?

02:31.107 --> 02:33.631
Uh, have you ever heard
of Alberta Haynes?

02:33.675 --> 02:35.416
- What?
- Step aside, Isaac.

02:35.459 --> 02:37.374
The name rings a bell.

02:37.418 --> 02:38.375
Alberta Haynes was a singer,

02:38.419 --> 02:39.898
a <i>wonderful</i> singer.

02:39.942 --> 02:41.813
Tell us
something we don't know.

02:41.857 --> 02:42.945
Believe it
or not,

02:42.988 --> 02:44.642
she died right here
in this house.

02:44.686 --> 02:46.470
Someone died
in this house?

02:46.514 --> 02:47.602
I'm shocked.

02:47.645 --> 02:48.690
I'm actually writing a book

02:48.733 --> 02:50.735
on Alberta's life and career.

02:50.779 --> 02:52.824
What? A book about me?

02:52.868 --> 02:54.652
Did you hear that, Isaac?

02:54.696 --> 02:55.958
Well, come on in
and sit down.

02:56.001 --> 02:57.873
Oh, sorry for the mess.

02:57.916 --> 02:59.135
We're in the middle
of turning the house

02:59.179 --> 03:00.310
into a bed-and-breakfast.

03:00.354 --> 03:02.530
Sam, stay on topic. Me.

03:02.573 --> 03:05.837
So, uh, you study singers?

03:05.881 --> 03:07.187
Jazz musicians, yes.

03:07.230 --> 03:09.232
But Alberta is my specialty.

03:09.276 --> 03:12.714
I'm actually the head curator
of the Alberta Haynes Museum

03:12.757 --> 03:14.324
in Altoona, Pennsylvania.

03:14.368 --> 03:16.718
Wow, there's a whole museum
- about you, Alberta.
- Oh!

03:16.761 --> 03:18.633
Died. I just died again.

03:18.676 --> 03:22.245
- Who's the nerd?
- He is historian who's
not here to study Isaac.

03:22.289 --> 03:23.290
Thank you, Thor!

03:23.333 --> 03:25.205
Her life story is
an inspiration.

03:25.248 --> 03:27.946
I mean, born in Tulsa
to Jamaican parents...

03:27.990 --> 03:29.121
Mm, tell it.

03:29.165 --> 03:30.514
As a young woman,
she came to Harlem

03:30.558 --> 03:31.776
during the Great Migration

03:31.820 --> 03:33.343
with nothing
but a dream in her heart

03:33.387 --> 03:35.519
and a boatload of talent.

03:35.563 --> 03:38.087
Can we record this? Whip out
that damn iPhone, Sam.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.568
Oh, she sounds like
an incredible person.

03:40.611 --> 03:41.917
Sam, ask him about my murder.

03:41.960 --> 03:43.527
Oh, no, not
this again.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.486
How exactly did
Alberta die?

03:45.529 --> 03:49.141
Oh, her death is hotly debated
amongst academics.

03:49.185 --> 03:51.709
I mean, the official cause
was a cardiac event,

03:51.753 --> 03:54.146
but, between you and me,

03:54.190 --> 03:55.887
I've always suspected foul play.

03:57.237 --> 03:58.107
I told you all
I was too important

03:58.150 --> 03:59.543
to die of a heart attack.

03:59.587 --> 04:00.936
Well, if you're excited
about being murdered,

04:00.979 --> 04:02.198
I am excited for you.

04:02.242 --> 04:03.678
Who would want
to kill her?

04:03.721 --> 04:04.896
Mm, it's hard to say.

04:04.940 --> 04:06.550
I mean, someone as...

04:06.594 --> 04:08.073
beautiful and as talented

04:08.117 --> 04:09.684
as Alberta... Oh.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.555
...would attract many rivals.

04:11.599 --> 04:12.817
Genius. Mwah!

04:12.861 --> 04:13.818
This man is a genius.

04:13.862 --> 04:15.385
Oh, Sam, tell Todd

04:15.429 --> 04:18.127
my old trunk's upstairs
if he wants to look at it.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.912
You know,
I-I just remembered something.

04:20.956 --> 04:22.262
Upstairs,

04:22.305 --> 04:24.220
there's this trunk.
It's full of stuff

04:24.264 --> 04:26.135
that seems
like it's from the '20s.

04:26.178 --> 04:27.919
So maybe that
could belong

04:27.963 --> 04:30.008
to this Alberta person.

04:30.052 --> 04:31.923
"This Alberta person"?

04:31.967 --> 04:33.577
Girl, like we ain't besties.

04:34.665 --> 04:36.406
Ooh, you so good.

04:37.973 --> 04:39.496
<i>Wow.</i>

04:39.540 --> 04:40.845
Sheet music, letters,

04:40.889 --> 04:42.543
moonshine, a mink scarf.

04:42.586 --> 04:43.848
That is

04:43.892 --> 04:45.546
a handsome trunk.

04:45.589 --> 04:46.808
Handsome and heavy.

04:46.851 --> 04:48.113
I remember
lugging that thing over

04:48.157 --> 04:49.767
from the motel
the night I performed.

04:49.811 --> 04:51.900
You didn't
- stay here?
- Oh, no, wasn't allowed,

04:51.943 --> 04:53.423
'cause, you know, racism.

04:53.467 --> 04:55.904
- Ah.
- Well, if it helps,
I don't see color.

04:55.947 --> 04:58.515
Literally. It cost me
several games of <i>Risk.</i>

04:59.951 --> 05:01.301
This is a treasure trove.

05:01.344 --> 05:02.780
I'm gonna need
a good amount of time

05:02.824 --> 05:04.216
to get through these materials.

05:04.260 --> 05:06.088
Well, uh, uh, take
all the time you need, Todd.

05:06.131 --> 05:08.003
I don't want
to impose, but...

05:08.046 --> 05:10.788
would you consider
allowing me to stay the night?

05:10.832 --> 05:13.443
You said this place
was a B&B, correct?

05:13.487 --> 05:16.141
Well, yeah, but it's-it's not
exactly open yet.

05:16.185 --> 05:17.665
Well, I could be
your first guest.

05:17.708 --> 05:19.971
You know what, Todd, uh, the
rooms, they're not really ready.

05:20.015 --> 05:21.495
Uh, we haven't
even started picking out

05:21.538 --> 05:22.844
those tiny little soaps.

05:22.887 --> 05:24.802
I don't need
any of that fancy stuff.

05:24.846 --> 05:27.152
I mean, this room is fine.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.197
Wait, hold up.
This is my room.

05:28.240 --> 05:29.851
I can give you $500.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.333
Welcome to
the Woodstone Bed-and-Breakfast.

05:35.117 --> 05:36.901
Time for afternoon walk!

05:38.512 --> 05:40.818
Oh, hadn't you heard?
Afternoon walk's been canceled.

05:40.862 --> 05:42.037
- Why?
- Well,

05:42.080 --> 05:44.474
apparently, this
bearded historian fellow

05:44.518 --> 05:45.693
is spending the night.

05:45.736 --> 05:47.956
Samantha and Alberta
are busy tending to him.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.828
Okay, so we go together.
Just the two of us.

05:50.872 --> 05:52.221
You and me? Alone?

05:52.264 --> 05:54.745
- Yes!
- Yes, but th...

05:54.789 --> 05:57.269
that wouldn't be the
walking crew, now would it?

05:57.313 --> 05:59.315
Give us a chance to catch up.
We never talk.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.752
Right. We never do. That is
a true thing you're saying.

06:01.796 --> 06:03.188
I am free, you are free.

06:03.232 --> 06:04.712
We both love walking.

06:04.755 --> 06:05.974
Also true statements.

06:06.017 --> 06:07.497
So really no reason
not to proceed.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.456
Yes, I-I'm having
trouble thinking of one.

06:09.499 --> 06:10.457
Will be fun.

06:10.500 --> 06:11.501
- Okay!
- Yes!

06:11.545 --> 06:12.502
Let's go!

06:12.546 --> 06:13.938
- Together!
- Oh, God.

06:13.982 --> 06:16.680
Friendship!

06:16.724 --> 06:18.769
We have a stranger
in our house,

06:18.813 --> 06:20.554
and-and I think
it feels weird.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.860
Jay, that's sort of what
running a B&B is.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.253
I mean, I understand it,
theoretically.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.733
But now
that-that it's happening,

06:25.776 --> 06:26.995
it just-- it feels weird.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.649
Well, I think
it's gonna be fun.

06:28.692 --> 06:30.128
It's a dry run.

06:30.172 --> 06:31.652
This is a chance for us
to prove to ourselves

06:31.695 --> 06:32.696
we can do this.

06:32.740 --> 06:33.654
You guys
are gonna be great.

06:33.697 --> 06:35.046
The mainthing is

06:35.090 --> 06:36.483
you want to get in good
with the travel agents.

06:36.526 --> 06:38.093
we basically run

06:38.136 --> 06:39.573
the whole hospitality game.

06:39.616 --> 06:42.097
Pete, travel agents
don't really exist anymore.

06:42.140 --> 06:43.664
- What?
- Yeah, people
just kind of book

06:43.707 --> 06:45.013
their own travel now.

06:45.056 --> 06:46.144
But they don't have
the contacts,

06:46.188 --> 06:47.885
the personal relationships.

06:47.929 --> 06:50.322
They don't know who to fax.

06:51.106 --> 06:54.675
Hey. I didn't pack
for an overnight, obviously.

06:54.718 --> 06:56.067
So, would I be able

06:56.111 --> 06:57.460
to borrow some pajamas?

06:57.504 --> 06:59.462
Sure. Yeah.
Jay can lend you

06:59.506 --> 07:01.464
a T-shirt
and some pajama bottoms.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.900
- What?
- Cool.

07:02.944 --> 07:03.901
Oh, and, also,

07:03.945 --> 07:05.120
if I don't eat
soon...

07:05.163 --> 07:07.035
we're gonna have a problem.

07:07.078 --> 07:08.558
I-I'm hypoglycemic,

07:08.602 --> 07:10.342
so it's kind of urgent.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.432
We will definitely fix
something up for you.

07:12.475 --> 07:13.868
Thanks.

07:13.911 --> 07:17.306
He wants to put
his junk in my jam-jams?

07:17.349 --> 07:18.916
Jay, this is running a B&B.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.962
This is what separates us
from the hotels of the world.

07:21.005 --> 07:23.094
People expect a personal touch.

07:23.138 --> 07:24.966
Something personal's
getting touched all right.

07:25.009 --> 07:28.186
Can you focus? What do we
have that we can cook Todd?

07:28.230 --> 07:29.623
There's nothing in the fridge.
We got to go to the market.

07:29.666 --> 07:32.843
We don't have time
for that. Uh, just...

07:32.887 --> 07:34.497
Here.

07:34.541 --> 07:35.629
Cook him this.

07:37.021 --> 07:38.719
This chicken expires today.

07:38.762 --> 07:40.285
Those dates

07:40.329 --> 07:42.244
are just to make you throw
stuff away and buy more.

07:42.287 --> 07:43.811
I wrote a whole article on this.

07:43.854 --> 07:45.377
It's a scam by big chicken.

07:45.421 --> 07:47.684
- Big chicken?
- Yeah. So stop
acting like one

07:47.728 --> 07:48.946
and just cook it.

07:48.990 --> 07:51.514
Damn, girl.
I love that wordplay.

07:51.558 --> 07:52.994
Okay, there's weather
in Chicago

07:53.037 --> 07:54.169
and you need a
same-day change

07:54.212 --> 07:55.518
to a plane ticket--
what do you do?

07:55.562 --> 07:57.607
It's a button on your phone.
I'm sorry, Pete.

07:57.651 --> 07:58.782
Jiminy.

08:03.265 --> 08:04.527
You know, it sort of feel

08:04.571 --> 08:06.398
like Thor doing
all the work in conversation.

08:06.442 --> 08:09.184
I tell seal story.
I tell salmon story.

08:09.227 --> 08:10.968
I tell
other salmon story...

08:11.012 --> 08:13.623
I'm gonna level
with you, Thorfinn.

08:13.667 --> 08:14.668
You and I,

08:14.711 --> 08:15.669
we get along fine,

08:15.712 --> 08:17.192
but we are not

08:17.235 --> 08:19.063
"hang out alone together
outside the group" type friends.

08:19.107 --> 08:21.109
And that's okay.

08:22.153 --> 08:24.329
But we used to be closer.

08:24.373 --> 08:26.375
What are you talking about?

08:26.418 --> 08:28.420
Nothing.

08:28.464 --> 08:31.598
Nothing at all.
Just...

08:31.641 --> 08:33.338
return home in silence.

08:33.382 --> 08:35.384
That is a good idea.

08:35.427 --> 08:38.082
Sort of like salmon
returning home

08:38.126 --> 08:40.345
to spawning ground
in springtime.

08:40.389 --> 08:42.434
Which reminds me
of third salmon story.

08:42.478 --> 08:44.219
Maybe we can walk
a little faster.

08:44.262 --> 08:46.961
There was a bear
and a badger...

08:50.704 --> 08:53.184
Okay, that's, like, the fifth
time he's sniffed your coat.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.272
Clearly, there's
something off

08:54.316 --> 08:55.883
- about this fellow.
- The man

08:55.926 --> 08:56.971
is an academic.

08:57.014 --> 08:58.363
He's just looking for clues.

08:58.407 --> 09:01.410
See, this is how you connect
with history.

09:01.453 --> 09:02.672
Hey, Todd, uh, we brought you

09:02.716 --> 09:03.543
a fresh towel.

09:03.586 --> 09:05.196
And some
regular-sized soap.

09:05.240 --> 09:06.633
I'm so sorry about that.

09:06.676 --> 09:08.722
Thank you
for that delicious chicken.

09:08.765 --> 09:10.114
- Hmm.
- Did you know

09:10.158 --> 09:12.203
that Alberta's father
was actually a chef, too?

09:12.247 --> 09:13.509
Yeah, her
family lived

09:13.553 --> 09:15.293
above the restaurant
he worked in.

09:15.337 --> 09:17.426
Ah, Daddy could slay
the stove.

09:17.469 --> 09:18.949
He should've had
his own restaurant,

09:18.993 --> 09:20.734
but, again, racism.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.518
Thank you for letting me stay.
It's...

09:22.562 --> 09:24.041
it's, like, a six-hour drive

09:24.085 --> 09:25.434
- back to Altoona.
- What made you

09:25.477 --> 09:27.915
choose Altoona as the
location for the museum?

09:27.958 --> 09:29.220
Must be a new music city.

09:29.264 --> 09:31.396
A 21st century
New Orleans, no doubt.

09:31.440 --> 09:32.746
Well, uh, actually,

09:32.789 --> 09:34.356
the museum is in my garage.

09:34.399 --> 09:35.879
Ah, as all

09:35.923 --> 09:37.054
the best museums are.

09:37.098 --> 09:39.143
Technically, it's...
my mom's garage.

09:39.187 --> 09:41.189
Oh, you live
with your mom.

09:41.232 --> 09:43.104
- That makes sense.
Well, academics

09:43.147 --> 09:45.019
are often underpaid.

09:45.062 --> 09:46.020
Just wait

09:46.063 --> 09:47.151
till his book comes out.

09:47.195 --> 09:48.631
So when does
your book come out?

09:48.675 --> 09:51.155
Oh, it's planned
for a summer release.

09:51.199 --> 09:53.244
But, really, whenever.

09:53.288 --> 09:55.029
That's the beauty
of self-publishing.

09:55.072 --> 09:56.291
Bro, that's not even
a real book.

09:56.334 --> 09:57.640
Come on, Todd.

09:57.684 --> 10:00.295
Hey, do you want to see
something from my, uh...

10:00.338 --> 10:02.036
personal Alberta collection?

10:02.079 --> 10:03.037
Yes.

10:03.080 --> 10:04.212
I carry it with me

10:04.255 --> 10:05.909
everywhere.

10:05.953 --> 10:07.998
It's my most prized possession.

10:08.042 --> 10:09.304
Oh, God,
what is this gonna be?

10:09.347 --> 10:11.219
Voilà.

10:11.262 --> 10:13.264
Sorry, what am I
looking at here, Todd?

10:13.308 --> 10:15.440
It's Alberta's toenail.

10:16.441 --> 10:18.748
Oh, hell no! Uh-uh!

10:18.792 --> 10:20.750
Out of my room.
I want him out of my room.

10:20.794 --> 10:21.969
Why do you have that?

10:22.012 --> 10:23.405
What is wrong with you, Todd?

10:23.448 --> 10:25.668
I got it online.

10:25.712 --> 10:27.888
Really nothing you can't get
on there.

10:27.931 --> 10:29.977
- Still, why?
- You know,

10:30.020 --> 10:32.327
in <i>Jurassic Park,</i> when they
clone all those dinosaurs

10:32.370 --> 10:33.720
from just a little bit of blood?

10:33.763 --> 10:36.461
Well, maybe I
could, one day,

10:36.505 --> 10:39.769
make an Alberta from
just a little bit of nail.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.292
Dare to dream, Todd.

10:41.336 --> 10:43.773
Who knows? Maybe
we'd end up together.

10:43.817 --> 10:44.644
No, we would not!

10:44.687 --> 10:46.776
Oh, God.
The hell we would.

10:46.820 --> 10:47.908
Well...

10:47.951 --> 10:48.909
Oh.

10:50.432 --> 10:52.956
Time to hit the shower.

10:54.784 --> 10:55.872
Oh!

10:55.916 --> 10:57.091
My... God!

10:57.134 --> 10:59.789
Oh. No!

10:59.833 --> 11:01.443
No. Oh, God.

11:01.486 --> 11:04.141
No. Oh, don't make me
hate my own face.

11:04.185 --> 11:05.447
Todd, you creepy nut.

11:10.147 --> 11:11.758
<i>Well, look at it this way,
from here on out,</i>

11:11.801 --> 11:13.716
all our other guests are
gonna seem normal in comparison.

11:13.760 --> 11:16.284
I don't think I can handle
any other guests after Todd.

11:16.327 --> 11:18.373
I mean, do you really think
we're cut out for this?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.461
Not with that attitude.

11:19.504 --> 11:20.767
Are you serious?

11:20.810 --> 11:22.856
We turned our entire lives
upside down,

11:22.899 --> 11:25.467
and you want to bail
after one difficult guest?

11:25.510 --> 11:26.729
One difficult guest?

11:26.773 --> 11:27.730
That's like saying
Charles Manson

11:27.774 --> 11:29.036
was one difficult neighbor.

11:29.079 --> 11:30.864
Look, he's not dangerous.
He's just weird.

11:30.907 --> 11:33.083
And he's only gonna be here
for another couple hours.

11:33.127 --> 11:35.129
We need to find a better
way to vet our guests.

11:35.172 --> 11:38.262
Oh, like some sort of licensed
go-between, perhaps?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.655
Oh, if he could hear me,

11:39.699 --> 11:41.135
that would have been
a powerful rejoinder.

11:42.353 --> 11:43.528
Sam,

11:43.572 --> 11:45.487
I couldn't sleep
a wink last night.

11:45.530 --> 11:47.794
Just haunted by my own face.

11:47.837 --> 11:50.013
Oh, Alberta, I'm
sorry. It's awful.

11:50.057 --> 11:51.667
Nobody is
happy about it.

11:51.711 --> 11:52.624
Good morning,

11:52.668 --> 11:53.887
everyone!

11:53.930 --> 11:55.715
Greetings and salutations.

11:55.758 --> 11:57.934
Almost nobody.

11:57.978 --> 11:58.979
Alberta,

11:59.022 --> 12:00.720
you're down here.
I could've sworn

12:00.763 --> 12:02.330
I just saw you upstairs.

12:02.373 --> 12:03.723
Ha-ha. I get it, Isaac.

12:03.766 --> 12:07.422
No, I'm sorry, that
was merely your visage

12:07.465 --> 12:10.512
on a 35-year-old
man's back.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.775
My mistake!

12:12.819 --> 12:14.734
I said I get it!

12:15.560 --> 12:16.736
You happy now?

12:20.565 --> 12:22.350
Shh, shh.

12:22.393 --> 12:24.134
Nap time,
little one.

12:25.222 --> 12:26.528
Shh.

12:26.571 --> 12:28.835
Is okay.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.785
sieging villages.

13:11.573 --> 13:13.967
Listen, uh,
I was just having fun.

13:14.010 --> 13:15.533
I apologize.

13:15.577 --> 13:17.753
- I'm sorry.
- Yeah, well, I probably
had it coming.

13:17.797 --> 13:21.452
Look, I know
I wasn't famous in my day,

13:21.496 --> 13:24.673
but when Todd showed up,
for a second, I thought,

13:24.716 --> 13:28.895
"Wow, the world remembers
Alberta Haynes."

13:28.938 --> 13:31.027
But the truth is, the
only one who remembers me

13:31.071 --> 13:34.422
is some creepy weirdo with
a jar full of toenails.

13:34.465 --> 13:36.598
Child, that's my legacy.

13:36.641 --> 13:40.123
To be fair,
it was just the one toenail.

13:40.167 --> 13:43.735
It's not
just about Todd.

13:43.779 --> 13:45.520
You know, my daddy
couldn't achieve his dreams

13:45.563 --> 13:48.218
because the world held him back.

13:48.262 --> 13:51.047
But he always told me I could.

13:51.091 --> 13:52.744
That's why I wanted
to be a star,

13:52.788 --> 13:55.573
so that his struggle
would have been worth it.

13:56.313 --> 13:58.141
I guess I failed him.

14:00.448 --> 14:03.059
Hi. Uh, have you guys
seen Sam?

14:03.103 --> 14:04.887
It's Todd.
I think he's dying.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.498
Oh, my God.

14:07.542 --> 14:08.456
What is happening?

14:08.499 --> 14:09.805
Did anybody
see anything?

14:09.849 --> 14:11.372
That-That's E. coli face.
That's the chicken.

14:11.415 --> 14:12.721
Can you not?
Call 911.

14:12.764 --> 14:13.896
- What is he
talking about?

14:13.940 --> 14:15.071
- The chicken?
- Look,

14:15.115 --> 14:16.203
we fed him some chicken
that was...

14:16.246 --> 14:17.552
at its expiration date.

14:17.595 --> 14:19.597
Sam, those dates are
on there for a reason.

14:19.641 --> 14:21.556
Guys, he looks
really sick.

14:21.599 --> 14:23.775
If he dies,
he could become a ghost,

14:23.819 --> 14:26.256
and I'm not spending eternity
with my stalker.

14:26.300 --> 14:27.518
Yeah, and I'm not sharing
a room with him.

14:27.562 --> 14:28.824
We're doing
a rotation thing.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.260
W-Wait. Okay, wait.

14:30.304 --> 14:32.480
What percentage of people
who die become ghosts?

14:32.523 --> 14:34.003
It's actually fairly
low. I would say,

14:34.047 --> 14:35.787
mm, like, maybe
five percent?

14:35.831 --> 14:37.920
- That's not that high.
- Are you willing to
take that risk, Sam?

14:37.964 --> 14:39.835
'Cause, remember, he's gonna
become your problem, too.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.663
- What do we do?
- We need to get him
off the property.

14:41.706 --> 14:43.795
Okay! I called an ambulance.
They're on their way.

14:43.839 --> 14:45.275
Jay, you're
not gonna like this,

14:45.319 --> 14:46.363
but we have to drag him
off the property.

14:46.407 --> 14:47.582
- What?
- Mm-hmm.

14:47.625 --> 14:48.583
W-We cannot let
him die here.

14:48.626 --> 14:49.889
He could
become a ghost

14:49.932 --> 14:51.412
and we'd be stuck
with him forever.

14:51.455 --> 14:52.848
You mean invisible Todd,
roaming the hallways,

14:52.892 --> 14:54.632
collecting everyone's toenails?
I do not like that.

14:54.676 --> 14:55.677
- None of us do.
- Okay, okay, okay,

14:55.720 --> 14:57.113
but-but how are
the two of us

14:57.157 --> 14:58.723
gonna carry <i>him?</i>

15:03.598 --> 15:05.513
I did not sign up for this.

15:05.556 --> 15:07.863
I-I need a break.
This is too hard.

15:07.907 --> 15:09.647
Uh-uh! Come on!
No breaks!

15:09.691 --> 15:11.214
You'll sleep
when you're dead.

15:11.258 --> 15:12.433
Why do we sleep?

15:12.476 --> 15:13.869
- We just do!
- We just do! Let's go!

15:13.913 --> 15:15.784
Let's move
this body.

15:15.827 --> 15:17.917
Well, he's not technically
a body yet.

15:17.960 --> 15:20.528
You're gonna be okay, Todd.
The paramedics are here.

15:21.442 --> 15:23.009
- Hey.
- Why is he out here?

15:23.052 --> 15:24.314
You're not supposed
to move him.

15:24.358 --> 15:26.360
Sorry. We were
just trying to help.

15:27.535 --> 15:28.928
You're gonna
be fine, Todd.

15:28.971 --> 15:30.451
Ooh!

15:32.540 --> 15:34.585
I really hope
we didn't kill him.

15:34.629 --> 15:35.325
What?

15:35.369 --> 15:36.326
Nothing.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.421
It was you.

15:45.770 --> 15:46.989
You sang to me.

15:47.033 --> 15:49.644
Yes. Uh, tried to teach you
to say "Thorfinn,"

15:49.687 --> 15:54.388
but eventually decide
"Gordon" pretty cute.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.521
All these years,

15:57.565 --> 15:59.045
why didn't you say something?

15:59.088 --> 16:03.179
Well, I always assume,
after you die, you remember me.

16:03.223 --> 16:05.573
Excited to say hi,
catch up, old times.

16:05.616 --> 16:09.620
But instead it seem
you more have terror

16:09.664 --> 16:13.842
of Thor and a lot of saying
my pelts smell bad.

16:17.411 --> 16:19.674
You were so sweet to me,

16:19.717 --> 16:22.807
and I have just been awful.

16:22.851 --> 16:23.895
Thor get it.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.549
Pelts do smell.

16:25.593 --> 16:29.031
Used to soak them in wolf urine
to ward off bear.

16:29.075 --> 16:32.730
You were there for me
when no one else was.

16:32.774 --> 16:34.471
Thank you.

16:34.515 --> 16:37.344
Gordon miss Hetty.

16:37.387 --> 16:40.042
Welcome back.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.478
Mmm.

16:41.522 --> 16:43.828
Oh. Yeah, that is
quite pungent.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.484
I just got off the phone
with the hospital.

16:47.528 --> 16:48.746
He's gonna be okay.

16:48.790 --> 16:51.401
Oh, we didn't kill
our first guest.

16:51.445 --> 16:52.837
How 'bout those Livings,

16:52.881 --> 16:55.449
trying to carry that creepy Todd
out on that blanket?

16:55.492 --> 16:56.450
Hey, hey,

16:56.493 --> 16:57.494
who-who am I?

16:57.538 --> 16:58.626
"Oh, no, this is too heavy.

16:58.669 --> 16:59.888
I need to take a nap."

16:59.931 --> 17:01.150
I didn't say that!

17:01.194 --> 17:02.717
Yes.
- Yes, you did.

17:02.760 --> 17:03.935
"Expiration dates
are a hoax."

17:03.979 --> 17:05.546
Oh, very funny.

17:05.589 --> 17:07.722
Y'all, stop trying to make
me laugh. I'm still upset.

17:07.765 --> 17:09.506
Sam, be honest--
would it help my chances

17:09.550 --> 17:11.247
if I got your face
tattooed on my back?

17:11.291 --> 17:13.467
Please don't do that.
- Ah. See?

17:13.510 --> 17:15.512
This right here,
this is what it's all about.

17:15.556 --> 17:16.948
These little moments.

17:16.992 --> 17:19.081
These are the things
we're all gonna remember.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.648
Shut up, Pete...

17:20.691 --> 17:22.302
- You ruined it.
- Womp!

17:23.651 --> 17:25.087
What is going on?

17:25.131 --> 17:27.829
Oh, the ghosts are throwing
down some newfound wisdom.

17:27.872 --> 17:29.439
Oh, boy. Last time
that happened,

17:29.483 --> 17:31.006
our gazebo burned down.

17:31.050 --> 17:33.095
They're saying the moments
you really remember

17:33.139 --> 17:35.880
are the ones you spend
with the people you love.

17:35.924 --> 17:37.969
Look, running the B&B
will be hard,

17:38.013 --> 17:40.233
but at least we get
to do it together.

17:40.276 --> 17:41.712
Remember, when we were back
in the city,

17:41.756 --> 17:44.411
we worked so many hours,
we barely saw each other.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.630
I know. We're really
lucky to get to do this.

17:46.674 --> 17:48.415
And I'm sorry. I just...

17:48.458 --> 17:50.286
I kind of freaked out a little.

17:50.330 --> 17:51.418
Was it the toenail?

17:51.461 --> 17:53.811
It wasn't not
the toenail.

17:53.855 --> 17:55.335
Right.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.773
My buddy Neal just
sent me a link.

17:58.816 --> 18:01.341
Woodstone Mansion
is blowing up.

18:01.384 --> 18:02.603
- Currently?
Oh!

18:02.646 --> 18:03.821
- Run for your lives!
- To the cholera pit!

18:03.865 --> 18:05.301
It's the safest place!

18:05.345 --> 18:06.650
Just relax, everybody.

18:06.694 --> 18:08.130
That's
an Internet term.

18:08.174 --> 18:09.610
It sometimes is a good thing.

18:09.653 --> 18:11.829
Oh. Never mind.

18:11.873 --> 18:15.616
Oh, please be a good thing.
Please be a good thing.

18:15.659 --> 18:17.879
Oh, my God, it's Todd.

18:17.922 --> 18:20.186
An exciting morning here
at Hudson Valley Memorial,

18:20.229 --> 18:23.058
where a visiting jazz historian
nearly died

18:23.102 --> 18:24.320
after being poisoned.

18:24.364 --> 18:25.843
Can you tell us
what happened?

18:25.887 --> 18:28.672
Well, I was staying at the
Woodstone Bed-and-Breakfast...

18:28.716 --> 18:30.935
- Oh, no.
- We're finished.

18:30.979 --> 18:34.025
...when I discovered
a very old bottle of moonshine.

18:34.069 --> 18:35.026
So I drank from it.

18:35.070 --> 18:36.854
Why would you do that?

18:36.898 --> 18:38.160
I'm a curator and collector
of all things

18:38.204 --> 18:40.641
relating to jazz legend
Alberta Haynes,

18:40.684 --> 18:42.121
and I have reason to believe

18:42.164 --> 18:45.167
that she was the very last
person to drink from it.

18:45.211 --> 18:48.039
And I wanted to put my lips
where hers had been.

18:48.083 --> 18:49.432
Okay.

18:49.476 --> 18:52.174
So it turns out the
bottle had poison in it?

18:52.218 --> 18:54.524
Yes, I spoke to the doctors,
and they informed me

18:54.568 --> 18:55.917
they believe it was strychnine.

18:55.960 --> 18:57.962
I've often assumed
that Alberta was murdered

18:58.006 --> 18:59.703
by a jealous rival.

18:59.747 --> 19:01.052
And now I know
I was probably right.

19:01.096 --> 19:02.184
Back to you, Jerry.

19:02.228 --> 19:03.403
You know
what this means?

19:03.446 --> 19:05.187
This means
we didn't almost kill Todd.

19:05.231 --> 19:06.754
Todd almost killed Todd.

19:06.797 --> 19:08.408
You know what this also means?

19:08.451 --> 19:10.105
I <i>was</i> murdered.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.628
Oh, yeah,
look at you.

19:11.672 --> 19:12.977
Hey, babe? Babe,
look at this.

19:13.021 --> 19:15.110

50,000 views already.

19:15.154 --> 19:16.546
W-Wait, 50,000?

19:16.590 --> 19:18.200
What-what do you mean, "views"?

19:18.244 --> 19:19.984
What is views? Is that people?

19:20.028 --> 19:21.899
- Yeah.
- Check out these comments.

19:21.943 --> 19:23.727
A lot of "This guy's
a creep," but, also,

19:23.771 --> 19:25.294
there's a ton of people
just saying really nice things

19:25.338 --> 19:27.992

to her album.

19:28.036 --> 19:29.690

How did I never hear
