00:04.170 --> 00:05.990
CONNOR:
It's a terrible thing

00:06.040 --> 00:09.430
when someone loses
theIr moral compass.

00:09.480 --> 00:10.788
It starts with
a small infraction,

00:10.830 --> 00:12.218
something insignificant.

00:12.270 --> 00:13.965
Then it's followecl
by two more Infractions

00:14.010 --> 00:17.138
because the first one has
long been expected as Justified.

00:17.190 --> 00:20.409
Then, like a pyramid scheme
of moral laxity,

00:20.450 --> 00:23.271
the lies become misdemeanors,

00:23.320 --> 00:24.571
the misdemeanors
become felonies,

00:24.630 --> 00:26.143
and the felonies
become a way of life.

00:26.200 --> 00:29.454
And that brings us
to the defendant,

00:29.500 --> 00:31.764
Governor Peter Florrick.

00:31.810 --> 00:33.846
It also brings us
to his enablers,

00:33.900 --> 00:36.289
his campaign manager, Eli Gold,

00:36.340 --> 00:38.467
and-- I'm sorry to say--

00:38.510 --> 00:42.332
his wife, Alicia Florrick.

00:42.390 --> 00:45.029
Now, Mrs. Florrick will be
sitting behind her husband

00:45.080 --> 00:47.423
every day in court.

00:47.480 --> 00:49.823
In this way, the defense
wants you to think warmly

00:49.870 --> 00:51.121
of Governor Florrick.

00:51.180 --> 00:52.659
Huh, if his wife
stands beside him,

00:52.700 --> 00:54.008
he can't be that bad.

00:54.050 --> 00:56.359
Well, I want you
to resist that temptation,

00:56.400 --> 00:58.129
and I will give you
a good reason.

00:58.180 --> 01:00.262
Alicia Florrick is part
of a criminal conspiracy...

01:00.320 --> 01:01.309
DIANE:
Objection, Your Honor,

01:01.360 --> 01:02.918
Mrs. Florrick is not on trial.

01:02.970 --> 01:04.483
CONNOR:
I didn't say she was on trial,

01:04.540 --> 01:06.144
I said you were cynically
using her presence...

01:06.190 --> 01:07.361
DIANE:
Excuse me, you Just accused

01:07.410 --> 01:08.798
her of criminal conspiracy.

01:08.850 --> 01:10.238
If anyone is being cynical...

01:10.280 --> 01:12.362
Excuse me, Your Honor,
this is my opening argument

01:12.420 --> 01:13.933
and the defense attorney
will have her chance...

01:13.980 --> 01:17.199
What is cynical, sir,
is to point to a wife

01:17.250 --> 01:18.854
who has stood by
her husband for years.

01:18.900 --> 01:20.629
And if she were not here,

01:20.680 --> 01:22.284
you would point to
thatas suspicious.Your Honor...

01:22.340 --> 01:24.683
No, I'm gonna let you two
burn yourselves out, okay?

01:24.730 --> 01:27.381
Is there anything else?
Are you done, Ms. Lockhart?

01:27.430 --> 01:29.204
I am, Your Honor. As you know,
I came late to this case.

01:29.260 --> 01:31.421
As you pointedly
keep reminding us

01:31.480 --> 01:34.210
over and over and over.
Do you see this?

01:34.260 --> 01:35.386
Yes.
And do you see

01:35.440 --> 01:37.567
the hash mark
that you have there?

01:37.610 --> 01:39.043
Yes.
Okay, every time

01:39.090 --> 01:41.263
one of you provokes
a round of crosstalk,

01:41.310 --> 01:43.221
you get a mark,
and whoever has

01:43.270 --> 01:45.875
the most at the end of the day
will be held

01:45.930 --> 01:49.309
in contempt and fined $10,000.
Now, isn't that fun?

01:49.370 --> 01:50.792
Well, it is... unusual.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.182
Okay.

01:52.240 --> 01:53.753
Good. Let's continue.

01:53.800 --> 01:56.360
[whispering]:
He hates me.

01:56.420 --> 01:58.320
He has for years.
I know.

01:58.370 --> 02:01.021
This is not gonna be
a cakewalk.

02:01.070 --> 02:03.152
GARBER: I got a call
around 2:00 am.

02:03.210 --> 02:05.201
that my son had been
involved in a shooting.

02:05.250 --> 02:07.855
I thought at first
he was the one who'd been shot,

02:07.910 --> 02:09.207
but they said
he was the shooter.

02:09.250 --> 02:10.649
And who was he accused
ofshooﬁng?

02:10.690 --> 02:12.169
His girlfriend,
Patty Tanniston.

02:12.210 --> 02:13.905
And what did you do
when you heard about this?

02:13.950 --> 02:15.599
I went to see Peter Florrick.

02:17.130 --> 02:19.086
He was state's attorney
at the time

02:19.130 --> 02:20.916
and my friend.

02:20.960 --> 02:23.565
You are a campaign donor of
Mr. Florrick's, is that right?

02:23.620 --> 02:25.702
GARBER: Yes.CONNOR: Hmm. What did
you ask him?

02:25.750 --> 02:28.571
GARBER:
I told him I didn't want
my son going to jail.

02:28.620 --> 02:30.349
I couldn't imagine
he'd done it, but

02:30.410 --> 02:32.310
the evidence was against him.And what did

02:32.360 --> 02:34.316
Mr. Florrick say?He said, "Lloyd..."

02:34.370 --> 02:37.055
[phone buzzes]"...you know how much
I count on your support.

02:37.110 --> 02:38.930
You have nothing
to worry about."

02:38.980 --> 02:41.062
CONNOR:
And you took this to mean?Exactly what

02:41.110 --> 02:43.578
it sounded like-- he was going
to make the charges go away.

02:43.640 --> 02:45.062
CONNOR:
And what happened after that?

02:45.120 --> 02:47.202
GARBER: Well, two days
into Richie's trial,

02:47.250 --> 02:49.593
some evidence
went missmg.

02:49.640 --> 02:52.905
Bullets that were
in the state crime lab.

02:52.950 --> 02:55.202
The judge declared a mistrial.

02:56.780 --> 02:59.431
What did she say?

02:59.480 --> 03:01.345
Nothing.

03:01.390 --> 03:02.789
She said nothing?

03:02.830 --> 03:04.263
What did you ask?

03:04.310 --> 03:06.358
How's the trial?

03:08.010 --> 03:10.649
Did you piss her off?

03:10.710 --> 03:12.314
What? Is that so unlike you?

03:12.360 --> 03:14.533
She's in Mrs. Florrick mode
for the trial.

03:14.580 --> 03:16.445
That's all.
So you think
he did it?

03:16.500 --> 03:18.798
I don't know.

03:18.850 --> 03:20.977
I think Alicia thinks
he didn't,

03:21.020 --> 03:24.148
but if he goes to prison,
that wouldn't be bad for you.

03:24.200 --> 03:26.191
Lucca.
VVhat?

03:26.240 --> 03:28.151
Can we give it a rest?

03:28.200 --> 03:30.282
Okay.

03:30.340 --> 03:34.208
I'll shut up, but
I speak the truth.

03:40.300 --> 03:42.473
Do you want...?
Do you want...?[thudding continues]

03:42.520 --> 03:44.476
Do you want us to leave?

03:44.520 --> 03:47.045
Not if you don't mind the dust.

03:47.090 --> 03:48.523
[banging]

03:50.960 --> 03:52.393
More expansions?

03:52.440 --> 03:54.260
It looks like it.

03:54.320 --> 03:56.311
I never said that.
Didn't happen.

03:56.360 --> 03:58.009
[phone buzzes]
GOLD:
Connor knows you won't

03:58.060 --> 04:00.312
put Peter on the stand,
so there's no way to rebut.

04:00.370 --> 04:03.407
DIANE: Okay, well, let's see
what I can do, and, uh,

04:03.460 --> 04:04.939
Peter and Alicia,

04:04.980 --> 04:07.062
hold hands, be warm

04:07.110 --> 04:09.715
towards each other.
You're being watched.

04:09.770 --> 04:12.637
The jury wants
to see you close.Doing our best.

04:12.680 --> 04:15.148
CUESTA:
All right, recess is over.

04:15.210 --> 04:17.019
Counselors, do you have
any questions?

04:17.080 --> 04:18.160
Uh, yes, Your Honor.

04:18.210 --> 04:20.940
Mr. Garber, you said you told

04:20.990 --> 04:23.072
Governor Florrick, you couldn't
imagine your son had done it,

04:23.130 --> 04:24.472
but the evidence
was against him.

04:24.520 --> 04:26.340
Is that right?
Yes.

04:26.390 --> 04:28.824
So, this conversation must have
been about the evidence?

04:28.870 --> 04:31.521
I'm sorry?Well, you said the
evidence was against him,

04:31.570 --> 04:35.267
your son, so you must have been
discussing the evidence?

04:35.310 --> 04:36.789
Oh. Right.
Good.

04:36.840 --> 04:38.489
And the governor, your friend,

04:38.530 --> 04:40.998
was familiar with the evidence.

04:41.060 --> 04:42.618
He had just
reviewed it?
Yes.

04:42.670 --> 04:44.183
So then, when
Governor Florrick said,

04:44.240 --> 04:45.969
"You have nothing
to worry about,"

04:46.020 --> 04:47.715
doesn't it make
more sense that

04:47.760 --> 04:49.671
he meant
"I have reviewed the evidence,

04:49.720 --> 04:51.620
and you have nothing
to worry about?"

04:51.680 --> 04:54.285
But that's not what he said.Oh, it's not? Well,

04:54.330 --> 04:56.639
let me read again
exactly what you said.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.329
"I couldn't imagine
he'd done it,

04:58.380 --> 05:00.371
but the evidence
was against him."

05:00.430 --> 05:03.035
And Governor Florrick,
yourfnend,

05:03.080 --> 05:04.775
the friend
you are now betraying...

05:04.820 --> 05:07.380
Objection.Withdrawn. The governor
responded after

05:07.430 --> 05:10.957
reviewing the evidence, "You
have nothing to worry about."

05:11.000 --> 05:13.958
Sir, why can't the governor's
comment, "You have nothing

05:14.000 --> 05:17.128
to worry about"
be interpreted as

05:17.180 --> 05:19.785
the calming commiseration
of a good friend?

05:21.880 --> 05:23.438
Oh, I see you're
looking at Mr. Fox.

05:23.490 --> 05:24.616
Should I ask him?Objection.

05:24.670 --> 05:26.012
CUESTA:
Yeah, sure. Sustained,

05:26.060 --> 05:27.311
but it did look like

05:27.370 --> 05:28.849
he was checking with you
for the answer.

05:28.890 --> 05:31.358
Should I ask again,
Mr. Garber?
No.

05:31.410 --> 05:34.675
It wasn't the commiseration of a
friend, and you know it, Peter.

05:34.720 --> 05:36.676
Excuse me, don't talk
to my client, sir,

05:36.720 --> 05:38.631
especially since you know
he can't talk back.

05:38.680 --> 05:40.466
And enjoy your deal
with the AUSA.

05:40.510 --> 05:42.853
Objection! Your Honor.Yeah, I'm way ahead of you.

05:42.900 --> 05:45.460
Two to one.Wait. No. How did I get one?

05:45.510 --> 05:48.126
Correction. Two to two.

05:48.170 --> 05:50.479
Eight years.

05:50.520 --> 05:52.476
No.

05:52.520 --> 05:55.216
Okay. Then what else do we have
to discuss?

05:55.260 --> 05:58.479
Nothing.

05:58.530 --> 06:00.430
I'll see you in court.Your husband did it,
Mrs. Florrick.

06:00.490 --> 06:02.526
Then prove it.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.356
Seriously.

06:04.400 --> 06:06.186
I've defended enough people

06:06.230 --> 06:08.403
to know how shallow
those words are.

06:08.450 --> 06:10.532
I don't care what you believe.

06:10.580 --> 06:14.277
I care what you can prove,
so prove it.

06:15.810 --> 06:17.971
I have a surprise witness,
Mrs. Florrick.

06:21.200 --> 06:25.113

Is that Alicia?I need your help.

06:31.340 --> 06:34.639
The AUSA is holding

06:34.690 --> 06:35.998
He says
he has a surprise witness.

06:36.040 --> 06:37.257
Can you find anything out?

06:37.300 --> 06:39.120
Sure. You think it's Cary?Maybe.

06:39.180 --> 06:40.693
I'll talk to Canning.

06:40.740 --> 06:42.742
But anything you can find out
would be helpful.

06:42.790 --> 06:44.303
I'll do my best.

06:44.360 --> 06:45.873
How are youdoing?

06:45.920 --> 06:48.969

06:57.320 --> 06:59.936

07:28.970 --> 07:30.392
I think she's gonna jump ship.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.099
Well, don't you think

07:32.140 --> 07:34.449
it would have been a good idea
to let me know?

07:34.490 --> 07:36.754
Well, what do you mean?
We did discuss this.

07:36.800 --> 07:39.109
I have meetings all week.
I can't cancel them

07:39.150 --> 07:40.458
because of the trial.

07:40.500 --> 07:41.751
No, no, no, the construction.

They had the wrong floor.

08:09.830 --> 08:12.617
Oh, my God.
What do we do?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.139
I called the insurance.

08:14.180 --> 08:15.488
We're covered.

08:23.850 --> 08:26.148
Okay, we'll think
of something.

08:26.200 --> 08:28.543
Diane, we have
to get back to court.

08:41.470 --> 08:43.995
There's another possibility.

08:44.040 --> 08:45.257
What's that?

08:45.300 --> 08:48.030
We expand to the 29th floor.

08:48.090 --> 08:49.512
What?

08:49.570 --> 08:51.174
We want to expand
and hire more lawyers.

The 29th floor is empty.

Yes.

we decide to expand, not because

someone accidentally
destroyed our conference room.

09:00.880 --> 09:02.359
Why not?

09:02.410 --> 09:04.401
[elevator bell dings]

09:06.370 --> 09:10.272
Matan Brody, Assistant State's
Attorney in Cook County.

09:10.330 --> 09:12.628
You were the lead prosecutor
in the Richard Locke case?

09:12.680 --> 09:14.238
With Cary Agos,
that's correct.

09:14.290 --> 09:15.803
CONNOR: Would you say Peter
Florrick micromanaged this case?

09:15.850 --> 09:18.728
I would.
And in what way
did he do that?

09:18.770 --> 09:20.761
Well, for one,
he came to the crime scene.

09:20.820 --> 09:22.981
CONNOR: He did?
On the night of the murder?

09:23.040 --> 09:24.905
Yes.

09:24.950 --> 09:26.554
CONNOR:
Is that unusual?

09:26.600 --> 09:27.942
MATAN: I've worked
with four SA's in 11 years.

09:28.000 --> 09:30.867
First time
I'd ever seen it.
Huh.

09:30.910 --> 09:34.175
So as the crime scene was being
processed, Peter was there?

09:34.220 --> 09:36.006
Yes. He asked a lot
of questions, he worried

09:36.050 --> 09:38.610
about their methods, their
experience, he had us review

09:38.660 --> 09:40.480
911 calls earlier in the week.

09:40.530 --> 09:42.316
And did this behavior continue?

09:42.360 --> 09:44.180
Yes, through prep,
right up until trial.

09:44.230 --> 09:45.618
Even the charging decision.

09:45.670 --> 09:47.399
We could've gone
for first degree murder,

09:47.450 --> 09:49.054
but he barely let us go
for second.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.716
CONNOR:
Thank you, Mr. Brody.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.409
DIANE:
The murder of

09:54.460 --> 09:56.803
Ms. Tanniston happened
just two weeks

09:56.850 --> 09:59.159
after Governor Elorrick
assumed office.

09:59.200 --> 10:00.679
Is that correct?Yes, I believe so.

10:00.730 --> 10:02.800
And this was Governor Florrick's
second stint

10:02.860 --> 10:04.589
as state's attorney

10:04.640 --> 10:06.596
after the corruption charges
against him

10:06.640 --> 10:08.198
had been thrown out?Yes.

10:08.250 --> 10:10.468
So, showing up
at a crime scene,

10:10.520 --> 10:12.954
making sure evidence
is collected properly--

10:13.000 --> 10:16.219
couldn't that be the action of
a re-elected state's attorney

10:16.260 --> 10:18.820
wanting to ensure
the-the highest standards?

10:18.870 --> 10:21.691
It could be, but it wasn't here.

10:23.230 --> 10:25.130
I see.

10:25.180 --> 10:27.660
How many gun felony charges
were thrown out

10:27.710 --> 10:30.668
under the previous
state's attorney, Glenn Childs?

10:30.710 --> 10:32.666
I don't know.

10:32.710 --> 10:34.268
625.

10:34.320 --> 10:36.584
That's over 12%.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.064
Do you know how many were
thrown out under Peter Florrick?

10:39.110 --> 10:41.192
Mr. Florrick was in office
for fewer yea rs.

10:41.240 --> 10:44.198
Well, I'm glad you're making
your bias evident.

10:44.250 --> 10:46.115
29 cases were
thrown out, Sir.

10:46.160 --> 10:47.718
That's fewer
than two percent.

10:47.770 --> 10:49.943
So it seems
that Peter Florrick's

10:49.990 --> 10:51.639
micromanagement was needed.

10:51.690 --> 10:52.850
It wasn't needed.
CONNOR:
Objection. Argumentative.

10:52.910 --> 10:54.514
Our department had double
the prosecutions

10:54.560 --> 10:56.608
before Peter Florrick.Of course you had double
the prosecutions

10:56.650 --> 10:58.208
because you didn't care
about the rule of law.Your Honor, I'm objecting here.

10:58.260 --> 10:59.989
This is not a debate.MATAN: Oh, that is such
defense attorney crap.

You staying out of trouble?

11:12.880 --> 11:15.019
Trying.

11:15.060 --> 11:18.587
You seem to be drawing
a lot of interest.

11:18.630 --> 11:21.542
It happens when
your husband's on trial.

11:21.590 --> 11:25.026
So, is Cary
testifying against Peter?

11:25.070 --> 11:26.321
Let me ask you a question,

11:26.380 --> 11:28.245
is Peter
scapegoating Cary?
No.

11:28.290 --> 11:30.417
Then no.

11:30.470 --> 11:31.596
So we're linked?

11:31.640 --> 11:32.857
Well, you don't go after Cary,

11:32.900 --> 11:34.424
I have no reason
to go after Peter.

11:34.470 --> 11:36.597
Good.

11:36.650 --> 11:37.594
Then that's that.

11:37.650 --> 11:40.039
Not really.

11:40.090 --> 11:41.216
You have a problem.

11:44.440 --> 11:45.429
Peter is guilty.

11:48.220 --> 11:50.006
I have to get back to court,
Mr. Canning.

11:50.050 --> 11:51.005
Thank you.

11:51.050 --> 11:53.223
The AUSA has proof.

11:53.270 --> 11:55.534
They have a witness
who's not on the list.

11:55.580 --> 11:57.059
How do you know that?

11:57.100 --> 11:58.704
Because she approached us.
She wanted to know

11:58.760 --> 12:00.751
what Cary was gonna say.She? Who's she?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.051
Geneva Pine.

12:02.110 --> 12:04.670
If she testifies,
Peter goes to prison.

12:07.630 --> 12:09.507
What can she say?

12:09.550 --> 12:12.280
Everything.

she's testifying,

prosecutor on the case,

13:59.700 --> 14:02.351

I can't get my head
around what you said.

Which part?

how to reconcile those two.

I should get to work.

14:55.930 --> 14:58.364
Later?

14:58.410 --> 14:59.490
Yeah.

15:05.160 --> 15:07.765
EMILY: So who do you want
to know about?

15:07.810 --> 15:09.949
I know all the dirt
in the SA's office.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.776
JASON:
Geneva Pine.

15:11.820 --> 15:13.253
What do you want to know?

15:13.300 --> 15:14.722
I need anything
out of the ordinary,

15:14.780 --> 15:16.941
anything that I can use.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.560
You want some turkey sandwich?

15:19.610 --> 15:22.170
No thanks, I ate.

15:22.220 --> 15:24.871
So, here's the thing,

15:24.920 --> 15:27.434
the state's attorney's office
is like a big ole family,

15:27.490 --> 15:30.869
with a mama, and a papa,
and a whole lot of children.

15:30.930 --> 15:32.795
Who's the papa?Peter Florrick.

15:32.840 --> 15:34.228
At the time.

15:34.280 --> 15:35.224
And the mama?

15:35.280 --> 15:37.498
Geneva Pine.

15:39.060 --> 15:42.712
That's why she had access
to all the cases.

15:42.760 --> 15:44.068
She was sleeping with him.

15:44.110 --> 15:46.328
She was sleeping

15:46.380 --> 15:48.371
with Peter Florrick?Yup.

15:48.420 --> 15:50.729
Long time affair.
From what I hear,

15:50.770 --> 15:52.818
she was sleeping with him
up to a month ago.

15:52.860 --> 15:54.851
That's why she's testifying.

15:54.910 --> 15:56.298
He broke it off with her.

15:56.340 --> 15:57.329
Can you use that?

15:59.080 --> 16:00.900

16:00.960 --> 16:02.996
Geneva Pine.

16:03.040 --> 16:04.826
I work in the _
state's attorney's office.

16:04.870 --> 16:06.474
CONNOR: And you worked
under Peter Florrick?
GENEVA:
Yes.

16:06.530 --> 16:07.599
And did you interrogate
Mr. Locke

16:07.660 --> 16:08.649
on the night of the shooting?

16:08.700 --> 16:10.611
I did.
Can you tell me

16:10.660 --> 16:12.389
about this interview?Mr. Locke was upset.

16:12.440 --> 16:13.998
He kept saying
he loved his girlfriend,

16:14.060 --> 16:15.266
that he wished things had
happened differently.

16:15.320 --> 16:16.799
CONNOR:
Differently?

16:16.840 --> 16:19.013
Um, what-what did
he mean by that?

16:19.060 --> 16:20.664
It felt like
he was about to confess.

16:20.710 --> 16:22.439
Did he have
an attorney with him?

16:22.500 --> 16:23.842
GENEVA: No, he hadn't
asked for one yet.

16:23.890 --> 16:25.141
But he did later?
Yes.

16:25.200 --> 16:26.451
After Peter showed up

16:26.500 --> 16:28.627
and interrupted Mr. Locke

16:28.680 --> 16:30.102
and asked ifI had
Mirandized him.

16:30.160 --> 16:31.502
Had you?
No,

16:31.550 --> 16:32.801
because I wasn't
questioning Mr. Locke.

16:32.860 --> 16:34.464
CONNOR:
Is that standard practice?

16:34.510 --> 16:37.115
If we arrest someone,
it's a custodial interrogation,

16:37.170 --> 16:38.683
and we read them
their rights.

16:38.730 --> 16:40.812
If we show up,
and they want to tell us

16:40.860 --> 16:42.999
about the crime they committed,
we don't stop them.

16:43.040 --> 16:44.951
But Peter Florrick made you.He did,

16:45.000 --> 16:47.218
and then Richard Locke
clammed up.

16:47.260 --> 16:48.955
Lawyered up.

16:49.000 --> 16:50.342
Tell me, um, what are these?

16:50.400 --> 16:52.960
The four bullets recovered
from the crime scene.

16:53.010 --> 16:55.831
These two were taken from
the wall behind Patty Tanniston.

16:55.880 --> 16:57.962
These two were recovered
from her body.

16:58.010 --> 17:00.001
I see, these were
the ones that killed her.

17:00.060 --> 17:01.834
Yes.
And you helped supervise

17:01.890 --> 17:03.881
the ballistic testing
for these bullets.

17:03.930 --> 17:05.409
Was there a conclusion
to this testing?

17:05.450 --> 17:07.054
Yes, they were fired

17:07.110 --> 17:10.238
from a Glock 26 owned
by Mr. Locke, the defendant.

17:10.290 --> 17:12.804
That seems like
pretty damning eVIdence.

17:12.850 --> 17:14.636
Why weren't they used at trial?They were used.

17:14.680 --> 17:18.764
But before the defense had
the chance to test the bullets,

17:18.820 --> 17:19.980
they were lost.

17:20.030 --> 17:21.679
Which caused the mistrial.

17:21.730 --> 17:24.039
Yes.
[scoffs]

17:24.080 --> 17:25.331
I thought we should conduct
a top-to-bottom search

17:25.390 --> 17:26.869
for the bullets.
And what did
Mr. Florrick say?

17:26.910 --> 17:28.468
He said he would take
it under advisement.

17:28.520 --> 17:29.737
And did he?
No.

17:29.780 --> 17:31.566
Nothing more at the moment,
Your Honor.

17:31.610 --> 17:35.819
Counselor, I imagine you want
your usual moment to consult.

17:35.880 --> 17:37.302
DIANE: Yes, just one
second, Your Honor.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.965

of nothing but time.

[gallery murmuring]

17:47.240 --> 17:50.539
[phone buzzing]

17:57.070 --> 17:59.538
Now, I'm only doing this
because our fates are tied.

17:59.600 --> 18:00.669
Doing what?

18:00.730 --> 18:02.459
Helping.

18:02.510 --> 18:04.683
As long as you keep Cary out
of it and don't point fingers,

18:04.730 --> 18:06.334
I got your back.
Really?

18:06.380 --> 18:07.813
That I'd like to see.

18:10.210 --> 18:11.950
Geneva Pine is lying.

18:12.000 --> 18:13.126
Is that what those say?

18:13.170 --> 18:14.694
No, these just give the motive.

18:14.740 --> 18:15.866
What's that?

18:15.920 --> 18:17.956
She was a spurned lover.

18:18.000 --> 18:19.956
These are affidavits
from coworkers saying

18:20.010 --> 18:22.046
that Peter Florrick broke off
an affair with her.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.045
Got it. Good. Thanks.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.351
You heard what I just said?

18:25.400 --> 18:27.868
Yes.

18:27.930 --> 18:30.490
Were you wanting me to cry,
Mr. Canning?

18:33.240 --> 18:34.457
[fake crying]:
Oh, my God.

18:34.500 --> 18:35.808
[sobbing dramatically]

18:35.850 --> 18:37.010
I thought my husband

18:37.070 --> 18:39.630
no longer cheated.

18:39.680 --> 18:43.195
Wow.

18:43.250 --> 18:44.729
God, I love you.

18:44.770 --> 18:45.941
I know.

18:52.260 --> 18:53.739
DIANE:
She was a good witness.

18:53.780 --> 18:55.088
The jury believed her.

18:55.130 --> 18:56.688
ELI: I know, so how can
we undercut her?

18:56.740 --> 18:58.560
DIANE: I can argue that
Peter was being diligent,

18:58.610 --> 19:00.919
but that doesn't undercut
the crime lab failure.

19:00.960 --> 19:02.211
ELI: Could you go after
her reputation?

19:02.270 --> 19:03.828
DIANE: I don't think
she has an issue

19:03.880 --> 19:04.824
with the
Disciplinary Commission.

19:04.880 --> 19:05.915
Go to motive.

19:05.970 --> 19:07.744
What do you mean?

19:07.790 --> 19:10.179
No one else heard Peter reject
the search of the crime lab.

19:10.230 --> 19:11.185
Only Geneva.

19:11.230 --> 19:12.447
You think she's lying?

19:12.490 --> 19:14.572
I think you can make a case
she's lying.
How?

19:14.630 --> 19:17.929
She was sleeping with Peter.

19:17.980 --> 19:19.845
These are affidavits
from coworkers

19:19.890 --> 19:21.972
saying Peter
broke up with her.

19:22.030 --> 19:24.453
And she's trying
to get back at him.

19:24.510 --> 19:26.637
Goes to motive.

19:26.680 --> 19:29.638
Uh...

19:29.690 --> 19:30.816
How did you get these?

19:30.860 --> 19:32.373
Canning.

19:35.910 --> 19:36.945
PETER:
Well, that was, uh,

19:37.000 --> 19:38.513
Chief Justice Bennett.

19:38.560 --> 19:39.959
He's going to look
into her background

19:40.000 --> 19:42.389
and see if we can
use anything.

19:44.830 --> 19:46.559
What?

19:47.530 --> 19:49.009
[clears throat]

19:49.050 --> 19:50.529
What are those?

19:50.580 --> 19:53.481
ALICIA: They are affidavits
from Geneva's coworkers

19:53.540 --> 19:55.440
saying that she's lying

19:55.490 --> 19:59.017
because you broke up with her
after having a long affair.

19:59.060 --> 20:00.971
[chuckles] What?

20:01.020 --> 20:03.978
They are affidavits
from coworkers.

20:04.020 --> 20:06.978
You have people saying
that Geneva and I had an affair?

20:07.030 --> 20:10.193
Yes, and that she's lying
because she wants to hurt you.

20:11.380 --> 20:12.859
That's not true.

20:12.900 --> 20:14.458
DIANE: Why don't
we step out?
No.

20:14.510 --> 20:16.296
It's not true,
we can't use them.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.648
We'll just give you a minute.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.203
Just use it, Peter.

20:19.260 --> 20:21.990
No.

20:22.040 --> 20:23.473
I don't know
what's in those affidavits,

20:23.520 --> 20:24.862
but there was nothing
between Geneva and me.

20:24.910 --> 20:26.309
If you're worried
about embarrassing me...

20:26.350 --> 20:28.079
I'm not worried
about anything, Alicia.

20:28.130 --> 20:29.563
When people think
bad things of you,

20:29.610 --> 20:30.872
they keep thinking bad things.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.353
What you have here

20:32.400 --> 20:34.573
is office gossip.

20:34.620 --> 20:36.178
Who got it for you?

20:36.230 --> 20:37.185
Your investigator?

20:37.230 --> 20:38.219
No.

20:41.100 --> 20:42.317
Well, I'm not gonna use it.

20:42.370 --> 20:43.587
[gunshots]

20:44.760 --> 20:46.011
[gun clicks]

20:46.070 --> 20:48.061
Be careful, this one's got a...

20:48.110 --> 20:50.419
It's got a little bit
of a kick to it.

20:50.460 --> 20:51.711
God, I look good with a gun.

20:51.770 --> 20:53.590
[chuckles]

20:53.640 --> 20:56.029
What do you need?

20:56.080 --> 20:58.207
Uh, something
that's difficult for you.

20:58.250 --> 20:59.683
I need you on the stand.

20:59.730 --> 21:02.198
Florrick trial?

21:02.260 --> 21:06.082
Yeah, I read
your ballistics report.

21:06.130 --> 21:07.995
It's deliberately impenetrable.

21:08.040 --> 21:10.691
I needed another test, but they
lost the bullets before I could.

21:10.740 --> 21:12.048
Yes,

21:12.090 --> 21:14.046
but to withhold
an opinion,

21:14.090 --> 21:16.479
you have to have
an opinion.

21:16.530 --> 21:19.090
Opinions are nothing
without science behind it.

21:19.140 --> 21:21.449
No, you're an expert witness.

21:21.490 --> 21:24.050
If your opinion rises
out of your expertise,

21:24.100 --> 21:26.489
that's something.

21:26.540 --> 21:28.883
You don't usually
play this game.

21:30.590 --> 21:31.841
I know.
My client's being railroaded.

21:31.890 --> 21:33.061
He's not being
"railroaded."

21:33.110 --> 21:35.101
He's a Democratic governor

21:35.160 --> 21:37.503
being judged by
a Democratic jury.

21:37.550 --> 21:41.338
_ That's as far from
"railroaded" as you can get.

21:41.380 --> 21:42.813
I'm not asking you to lie.

21:42.860 --> 21:44.384
I'm just...

21:44.430 --> 21:47.945
asking you to give
your preliminary opinion.

21:49.830 --> 21:53.209
In a manner that is
helpful to my defense.

22:03.620 --> 22:06.407
Please, Kurt.

22:06.450 --> 22:08.099
Help me?

22:08.150 --> 22:10.402
LUCCA:
You were

22:10.450 --> 22:12.759
the ballistics expert hired
by the SA's office

22:12.800 --> 22:14.142
to assess these bullets?

22:15.680 --> 22:17.068
Now, I should get something
out of the way,

22:17.110 --> 22:18.372
right up front.

22:18.420 --> 22:19.808
I'm questioning because you

22:19.860 --> 22:21.725
are related to a lavwer
on our defense team.

22:21.770 --> 22:24.079
Yes, I'm married
to Diane Lockhart.

22:24.120 --> 22:25.246
Congratulations.

22:25.300 --> 22:27.074
Thank you, Your Honor.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.554
LUCCA: But this marriage
happened after

22:29.600 --> 22:31.602
the ballistics testing
you did for the SA's office?

22:31.650 --> 22:33.606
Yes.
Did you give
Governor Florrick

22:33.650 --> 22:35.254
a preliminary report
on these bullets

22:35.310 --> 22:36.993
before they disappeared?Objection!

22:37.050 --> 22:39.393
Your Honor, this trial
has nothing to do

22:39.440 --> 22:40.429
with Locke's guilt.

22:40.480 --> 22:41.617
This is about Peter Florrick.

22:41.660 --> 22:42.786
Yes, and we
are offering

22:42.830 --> 22:44.309
Mr. McVeigh's testimony

22:44.360 --> 22:46.009
to show Governor Florrick's
state of mind.

22:46.060 --> 22:47.448
_His state of mind
is irrelevant here.

22:47.490 --> 22:49.799
It-it's his action...

22:49.840 --> 22:52.365
Governor Florrick had no reason
to lose these bullets

22:52.410 --> 22:53.798
if he thought
they proved Locke's innocence.

22:53.850 --> 22:55.795
In fact, it would be
against his interest...

22:55.850 --> 22:56.805
Your Honor, this is circular...

22:56.850 --> 22:58.238
[shushes]

22:59.900 --> 23:01.197
I'll allow.

23:01.240 --> 23:02.320
He likes her.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.893
LUCCA:
Mr. McVeigh?

23:03.940 --> 23:06.113
As a respected
ballistics expert,

23:06.160 --> 23:09.118
who has worked for
the SA's office for ten years--

23:09.170 --> 23:11.513
what was your determination
about these bullets?

23:11.560 --> 23:14.336
Well, I should say that
my findings were preliminary.

23:17.700 --> 23:19.918
But from what I saw,

23:19.960 --> 23:24.135
these bullets did not come
from Mr. Locke's gun.

23:24.180 --> 23:26.740
[laughs]
Pardon our dust.

23:26.790 --> 23:28.269
Pardon our noise.

23:28.310 --> 23:29.925
Yeah, the world has changed.

23:29.970 --> 23:31.221
People don't look

23:31.270 --> 23:33.147
for the same thing
in a law firm.

23:33.190 --> 23:34.623
They look
for a personality.

23:34.670 --> 23:36.706
Which is what we
want to supply--

23:36.760 --> 23:38.409
an all-service firm

23:38.460 --> 23:39.529
with a female perspective.[door opens]

23:39.590 --> 23:41.808
Diane, sorry to interrupt.

23:41.850 --> 23:44.762
Uh, the Coleman divorce,
the bitch is on the line.

23:44.810 --> 23:47.722
She wants to talk
to both of us.

23:47.770 --> 23:49.590
David, what is your problem?

23:49.640 --> 23:50.720
My problem?

23:50.770 --> 23:52.499
Yes, there is
no Coleman divorce.

23:52.560 --> 23:54.425
My problem is I'm
an equity partner.

23:54.470 --> 23:55.778
You're spending my money.

23:55.820 --> 23:57.731
No, I'm spending ourmoney.

23:57.780 --> 23:59.031
There was a vote.

23:59.080 --> 24:01.036
A vote in a dictatorship
is not a vote.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.216
It was a fair vote.

24:02.260 --> 24:03.511
With women outnumbering men.

24:03.570 --> 24:04.821
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry, David.

24:04.870 --> 24:05.859
The women outnumber the men.

24:05.920 --> 24:07.137
That must be so hard for you.

24:07.180 --> 24:08.135
It's not only hard,

24:08.180 --> 24:09.522
it's discriminatory.

24:09.570 --> 24:10.832
Oh, come on,
you know what we were doing.

24:10.880 --> 24:12.131
You've been on
a hiring binge,

24:12.180 --> 24:13.226
and how many men
have you interviewed?

24:13.270 --> 24:15.056
How many male lavwers

24:15.100 --> 24:16.488
have you met with?

24:16.540 --> 24:18.963
I have met with men.Watch it, Diane.

24:19.020 --> 24:21.056
There's a discriminatory suit
in your future.

24:21.110 --> 24:22.054
[door opens]

24:22.110 --> 24:24.886
[Jason clears throat]

24:24.940 --> 24:27.329
This is an affidavit
from a coworker

24:27.370 --> 24:28.325
of Geneva Pine.

24:28.370 --> 24:30.156
He says that Geneva often

24:30.200 --> 24:34.079
bullied her way
into other cases.

24:35.730 --> 24:37.504
That's it? Nothing else?

24:37.560 --> 24:38.720
Nope.

24:38.780 --> 24:40.429
Just time and dates

24:40.470 --> 24:42.995
and she had some issues
with back taxes.

24:43.040 --> 24:45.088
Nothing about her
sleeping with Peter?

24:48.790 --> 24:51.429
Nothing I could
confirm independently.

24:51.490 --> 24:54.789
Did you try
to confirm it independently?

24:58.100 --> 24:59.749
I'm just...

24:59.800 --> 25:01.836
I'm in a awkward position here.

25:01.890 --> 25:04.620
I know.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.366
And I think I'm done.

25:07.410 --> 25:10.800
What does that mean?

25:10.850 --> 25:13.580
I can't be doing this
for your husband anymore.

25:13.640 --> 25:15.289
Oh.

25:15.330 --> 25:17.890
Investigating.

25:19.640 --> 25:21.983
We'll talk after the trial.

25:22.040 --> 25:26.511
Okay.

25:26.560 --> 25:28.516
CONNOR: You're a student
of Mr. McVeigh's?

25:28.570 --> 25:30.993
Yes, for four years.

25:31.050 --> 25:32.472
And you were asked to review
Mr. McVeigh's work in his case?

25:32.530 --> 25:33.565
HOLLY:
Yes.

25:33.610 --> 25:34.474
[whispers]:
Diane?

25:34.530 --> 25:35.349
Who is she?

25:35.400 --> 25:36.788
Kurt's favorite.

25:36.830 --> 25:38.001
Whatever that means.

25:38.050 --> 25:39.130
CONNOR:
And what did you find?

25:39.180 --> 25:40.522
Well, it was quite
preliminary.

25:40.580 --> 25:42.832
Mr. McVeigh has
only conducted

25:42.880 --> 25:45.098
one chemical analysis
on the bullets.

25:45.150 --> 25:46.924
And as Kurt said,
before he could make

25:46.980 --> 25:48.584
a more thorough examination,

25:48.630 --> 25:49.972
the bullets went missing.

25:50.020 --> 25:51.328
Did you find any deficiency
in his analysis?

25:51.370 --> 25:53.099
Objection--
calls for speculation.

25:53.160 --> 25:54.582
Your Honor,
as the defense pointed out,

25:54.640 --> 25:57.507
this is_ not about whether
Locke is innocent or gUIlty.

25:57.550 --> 26:00.155
This is about
Peter's state of mind.

26:00.210 --> 26:01.723
And therefore,
Mr. McVeigh's work

26:01.770 --> 26:03.112
and how it was presented

26:03.170 --> 26:05.980
to Peter has a great bearing
on this trial.

26:06.040 --> 26:09.294
But Mr. McVeigh had actual
access to the bullets.

26:09.350 --> 26:11.079
Ms. Westfall does not...

26:11.130 --> 26:13.439
Oh, come on, you do not get
to benefit from your client's

26:13.480 --> 26:15.436
destruction of evidence!Objection--
that mischaracterizes

26:15.480 --> 26:17.175
the testimony here.
Okay.

26:17.220 --> 26:18.391
You both get a hash mark.

26:18.440 --> 26:19.486
Overruled, Ms. Lockhart.

26:19.530 --> 26:21.179
You can't have it
both ways!

26:21.230 --> 26:23.186
Thank you, Your Honor.
[clears throat]

26:23.230 --> 26:24.572
Uh, do you need me
to repeat the question?

26:24.620 --> 26:25.791
No, I'm good.

26:25.840 --> 26:27.535
I don't find any deficiencies

26:27.580 --> 26:30.231
in Mr. McVeigh's
analysis of the bullets.

26:30.280 --> 26:32.714
I do find that he, um--

26:32.760 --> 26:34.671
how shall I say this--

26:34.720 --> 26:36.540
oversold

26:36.590 --> 26:38.842
his results in court.

26:38.900 --> 26:41.630
Uh, it is very easy
to get a false negative

26:41.680 --> 26:43.329
in gas chromatography,
and I think

26:43.380 --> 26:44.631
he may have
downplayed that here.

26:44.690 --> 26:46.157
Are you suggesting
that Mr. McVeigh

26:46.210 --> 26:47.768
is lying here, Ms. Westfall?

26:47.820 --> 26:50.163
No, Kurt is one of
the most honest people I know.

26:50.210 --> 26:51.381
I...

26:51.430 --> 26:53.079
I do think he had reason

26:53.130 --> 26:55.121
to spin his results.

26:55.170 --> 26:56.694
I think that's fair,

26:56.740 --> 27:00.301
given the make-up
of the defense team.

27:00.350 --> 27:02.875
Nothing further,
Your Honor.

27:11.580 --> 27:13.184
[Lucca clears throat]

27:13.240 --> 27:15.708
Ms. Westfall, even if
what you say is true--

27:15.760 --> 27:19.014
Mr. McVeigh oversold
his conclusions here--

27:19.070 --> 27:21.493
there's no reason to believe
that he didn't equally

27:21.550 --> 27:25.190
oversell them_
to Governor Florrick?

27:25.250 --> 27:27.206
HOLLY:
Well, I can't speak to that.

27:27.250 --> 27:29.810
All I can say is that Kurt
always tells the truth.

27:29.860 --> 27:31.851
But this isn't
about Mr. McVeigh.

27:31.910 --> 27:35.073
This is about Governor
Florrick's state of mind.

27:35.130 --> 27:38.031
And if Governor Florrick heard
the same thing from Mr. McVeigh

27:38.090 --> 27:40.604
that we heard here,
he would have no reason

27:40.650 --> 27:42.379
to destroy those bullets.

27:42.440 --> 27:44.874
HOLLY:
I guess that's true.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.694
LUCCA:
One last question.

27:46.750 --> 27:49.446
When you've worked
for the SA's office,

27:49.490 --> 27:51.526
did the state's attorney
ever handle evidence?

27:51.580 --> 27:53.707
Evidence like these bullets?

27:53.750 --> 27:56.059
HOLLY: No, never,
it was always the prosecutor.

27:56.100 --> 27:57.886
So Matan?No, the co-prosecutor

27:57.930 --> 28:00.239
handled the evidence,
uh...

28:00.280 --> 28:02.271
Cary Agos.

28:05.460 --> 28:07.542
ALICIA:
We didn't do that.

28:07.590 --> 28:09.638
We did not point
the finger at Cary.

28:09.680 --> 28:11.159
And who did?

28:11.210 --> 28:12.461
It was your lawyer.

28:12.510 --> 28:13.681
Tell Cary we're
on the same side.

28:13.730 --> 28:16.244
Well, we were...

28:16.300 --> 28:17.949
until about ten minutes ago.

28:28.530 --> 28:30.179
CONNOR: Mr. Agos, did
you ever discuss

28:30.230 --> 28:31.743
with Governor Florrick
the ballistics results

28:31.790 --> 28:33.041
in the Locke case?
CARY:
Yes, I did.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.226
And what was the nature
of that discussion?

28:34.270 --> 28:35.521
That the bullets
connected Locke

28:35.580 --> 28:37.002
to the crime
and the murder weapon.

28:37.060 --> 28:38.482
Mr. McVeigh
suggested here that

28:38.540 --> 28:39.882
he was cautious
in his analy5is

28:39.930 --> 28:41.625
about the bullets.Yes, he was.

28:41.670 --> 28:44.321
But that's his way.

28:44.370 --> 28:46.713
We knew the bullets
damned Peter.

28:47.900 --> 28:49.709
You-you mean Locke?

28:51.290 --> 28:54.111
Yes, my apologies-- Locke.

28:55.820 --> 28:57.902
LUCCA:
Mr. Agos?

28:57.950 --> 29:00.202
Do you hate the Florricks?No.

29:00.260 --> 29:03.252
But don't you have reason
to be angry with the Florricks?

29:03.300 --> 29:04.517
Yes.

29:04.560 --> 29:06.255
Yes.

29:06.300 --> 29:08.177
You do.

29:08.220 --> 29:11.007
So then why should this court
take your testimony seriously?

29:11.050 --> 29:12.915
Because I'm telling the truth.

29:12.960 --> 29:14.268
As you see it?

29:14.310 --> 29:15.743
Yes, of course.

29:15.790 --> 29:17.929
That's all I have
to offer here.

29:17.970 --> 29:20.006
The truth as I see it.

29:20.060 --> 29:23.882
ALICIA:
You didn't have
to do that, Cary.

29:27.670 --> 29:29.490
I never meant you any harm.

29:30.980 --> 29:34.370
You know, it's
amazing, Alicia.

29:34.420 --> 29:37.639
After all these years
working together,

29:37.680 --> 29:41.241
you still think I would come
in here into a court of law

29:41.300 --> 29:44.770
and perjure myself to hurt you.

29:44.820 --> 29:48.119
I was here to tell the truth.

29:48.170 --> 29:50.695
What are you here to do?

29:53.870 --> 29:56.134
I need to take the stand.

29:56.180 --> 29:57.568
They want to hear from me.

29:57.620 --> 30:00.225
They need
to hear from me.

30:00.270 --> 30:02.443
Because I seem like a coward.

30:02.490 --> 30:03.798
LUCCA:
You don't.
You seem smart.

30:03.840 --> 30:05.489
The prosecution
could rip you apart

30:07.370 --> 30:08.928
PETER: I think the
jury's against me.

30:08.980 --> 30:10.277
What do you think?I think you're right.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.276
I need to testify.

30:13.330 --> 30:14.547
Diane?

30:17.720 --> 30:18.937
I don't know.

30:18.990 --> 30:21.072
We should prep.

30:21.120 --> 30:22.849
See how you do.

30:27.390 --> 30:28.459
[clears throat]

30:28.520 --> 30:30.078
You look grumpy.

30:30.130 --> 30:31.859
Nope.

30:31.910 --> 30:33.343
This is my happy face.

30:33.390 --> 30:34.994
[chuckles]

30:35.050 --> 30:36.608
Peter's in trouble.

30:36.660 --> 30:38.605
I think he might go to prison.

30:38.660 --> 30:40.616
You don't sound
that upset about it.

30:40.660 --> 30:41.695
He's your client.

30:41.750 --> 30:43.706
Hey, I'm trying my best.

30:43.750 --> 30:46.833
_ But the facts _
just aren't cooperating.

30:48.710 --> 30:50.883
How's Alicia?

30:50.930 --> 30:52.181
A rock.

30:52.240 --> 30:53.844
But if he goes to prison,

30:53.890 --> 30:55.972
she'll need a lot of comforting.

30:56.020 --> 30:59.023
[chuckles]

30:59.070 --> 31:00.799
Here's what you don't
understand about Alicia.

31:00.850 --> 31:02.579
He goes to prison?

31:02.640 --> 31:04.722
She'll never divorce him.

31:04.770 --> 31:06.249
Even
I disagree.

31:06.290 --> 31:08.292
Because you think
things are logical.

31:08.340 --> 31:09.500
[scoffs]

31:09.560 --> 31:11.778
She will visit him
every week in prison.

31:11.820 --> 31:14.732
She will slowly
drift away from me.

31:14.780 --> 31:17.123
And she will be
the stoic spouse.

31:17.170 --> 31:19.730
And if he doesn't go to prison?

31:19.790 --> 31:21.041
She'll divorce him.

31:21.090 --> 31:22.910
And which do you want?

31:24.090 --> 31:25.830
Because here's something

31:25.880 --> 31:27.484
you don't seem to understand

31:27.530 --> 31:29.225
about yourself.

31:29.270 --> 31:31.272
You may play the game
of being this hard-bitten--

31:31.320 --> 31:33.925
or is it hard-boiled?

31:33.970 --> 31:35.790
One of the hards.

31:35.850 --> 31:39.069
When you, in fact,

31:39.110 --> 31:41.544
have fallen in love.

31:45.030 --> 31:46.759
Tell me it's not true.

31:46.810 --> 31:48.072
And I'll leave you
here drinking.

31:48.120 --> 31:50.554
All by your lonesome.

31:52.300 --> 31:54.939
It's not true.

31:55.000 --> 31:57.468
I don't believe you.

31:59.000 --> 32:00.297
And take my advice.

32:00.350 --> 32:03.387
Stop playing it cool.

32:03.440 --> 32:06.341
You want her?

32:06.400 --> 32:08.868
Go to her and say,

32:08.920 --> 32:11.047
"I want you.

32:11.100 --> 32:13.489
"And I'll protect you.

32:13.540 --> 32:16.703
"You don't owe
your husband anything.

32:16.760 --> 32:18.409
"Be happy.

32:18.450 --> 32:20.236
"Come to me.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.714
Make me happy."

32:33.950 --> 32:36.987
Kurt...

32:37.040 --> 32:38.337
I'm sorry.

32:40.260 --> 32:42.080
I'm so sorry.

32:44.170 --> 32:47.082
I will make you happy
every day of your life,

32:47.130 --> 32:49.212
but please forgive me.

32:52.660 --> 32:53.911
Please.

33:04.590 --> 33:05.887
[Diane inhales]

33:11.510 --> 33:13.501
[sobbing quietly]

33:16.730 --> 33:19.039
ALICIA:
Lloyd Garber
donated $5,000

33:19.080 --> 33:20.809
to your PAC in 2009,
is that correct?

33:20.860 --> 33:22.339
That's correct.But in 2013,

33:22.390 --> 33:26.030
a year after
Richard Locke's mistrial,

33:26.090 --> 33:29.867
Lloyd Garber's
donations quadrupled.

33:29.920 --> 33:31.308
Can you explain?

33:31.350 --> 33:32.521
I cannot.

33:32.570 --> 33:34.128
Lloyd Garber and I

33:34.180 --> 33:35.738
never discussed money.There was no tit for tat?

33:35.790 --> 33:38.179
"You get my son off for murder

33:38.230 --> 33:39.709
and I'll_ increase
my finanCIal support"?

33:39.750 --> 33:41.399
I-I believe I already answered
that question.

33:41.450 --> 33:42.929
No. Too belligerent.

33:42.970 --> 33:44.187
Huh?

33:44.230 --> 33:45.572
You're the governor.

33:45.630 --> 33:46.881
Be dignified.

33:46.930 --> 33:48.192
He's going to ask it,

33:48.240 --> 33:49.491
and he's going to ask it
more than once.

33:49.540 --> 33:50.711
[clears throat]

33:50.760 --> 33:52.193
There was no tit for tat.

33:52.240 --> 33:53.582
There were never any
strings or conditions

33:53.640 --> 33:54.937
attached to Lloyd Garber's,

33:54.980 --> 33:56.538
or anyone else's,
contributions.

33:56.590 --> 33:58.023
As a man who was convicted

33:58.070 --> 34:00.982
of using state funds
to pay for prostitutes,

34:01.030 --> 34:03.339
why should we take
your word for anything?

34:03.380 --> 34:04.642
My attorney would object
to that.

34:04.690 --> 34:06.294
And Judge Cuesta overrules.

34:06.340 --> 34:08.126
[sighs]

34:08.170 --> 34:09.990
My conviction was overturned

34:10.040 --> 34:11.860
and I was fully exonerated.

34:11.910 --> 34:13.730
So are you saying that
you never paid for prostitutes?

34:13.790 --> 34:15.439
Never cheated on your wife?

34:15.480 --> 34:16.959
Haven't broken every promise
you've ever made?

34:20.790 --> 34:22.348
It goes to character.

34:22.400 --> 34:25.221
To your trustworthiness.

34:29.930 --> 34:32.535
I believe I've been up front
about this.

34:32.590 --> 34:35.411
I did pay for prostitutes,
I did cheat on my wife,

34:35.460 --> 34:37.234
and I have
worked every day

34:37.290 --> 34:39.417
to make up for those
indiscretions.

34:39.460 --> 34:40.859
So would you agree...I'm not finished.

34:40.900 --> 34:44.597
And that is one
of the reasons why,

34:44.640 --> 34:46.722
when I was voted
back into office,

34:46.780 --> 34:50.204
I spent every day
trying to make sure

34:50.260 --> 34:52.251
_ there was not _
a Single bad conVIction.

34:52.300 --> 34:55.303
Because I saw what bad
convictions did to families,

34:55.350 --> 34:57.523
did to me,

34:57.570 --> 35:00.209
did to my wife.

35:00.270 --> 35:03.353
And I swore that
I would never

35:03.400 --> 35:05.789
let that ever
happen again.

35:08.010 --> 35:09.443
Is that true?

35:09.490 --> 35:12.755
Yes, Counselor, that is true.

35:12.800 --> 35:16.804
_ It's also true that
I micromanaged this case.

35:16.850 --> 35:18.715
Guilty.

35:18.760 --> 35:19.977
But that's what
you should want

35:20.030 --> 35:22.112
from a state's attorney.

35:22.160 --> 35:24.469
Someone who won't accept excuses

35:24.510 --> 35:26.819
for a failure to Mirandize

35:26.860 --> 35:29.727
or allow for bad
eVIdence collection.

35:29.770 --> 35:31.943
Someone who
loses bullets?

35:31.990 --> 35:34.379
That was just a mistake.You say that
you have worked

35:34.430 --> 35:36.250
hard every day to make up for

35:36.300 --> 35:39.645
the indiscretions of the past...

35:39.700 --> 35:41.179
but we have evidence

35:41.220 --> 35:42.949
that you were having
a longtime affair

35:43.010 --> 35:45.171
with not only
a fellow prosecutor...We would object here.

35:45.230 --> 35:47.835
Yes, and Judge Cuesta doesn't
like you. He would allow.

35:47.880 --> 35:50.098
At what point are we playing
husband and wife here,

35:50.140 --> 35:51.789
and at what
p0int lawyers?

35:51.840 --> 35:53.011
All points.

35:53.060 --> 35:54.493
Because here's
the thing:

35:54.540 --> 35:56.314
you get up
on that stand,

35:56.370 --> 35:58.179
and every past indiscretion

35:58.240 --> 36:00.322
will be determined admissible.

36:00.370 --> 36:02.190
Your sleeping with Geneva Pine.I didn't sleep

36:02.240 --> 36:04.105
with Geneva...Your sleeping with
Marilyn Garbanza.

36:04.160 --> 36:06.720
I didn't sleep with...Your sleeping
with Ramona Lytton.

36:06.770 --> 36:08.590
And you sleeping
with Will Gardner

36:08.640 --> 36:11.427
and you sleeping with
your investigator!

36:15.470 --> 36:17.904
I'm not on trial, buddy.

36:17.950 --> 36:20.384
CONNOR:
Are you saying you didn't
sleep with Geneva Pine?

36:20.430 --> 36:22.250
That's exactly what I'm saying.

36:22.310 --> 36:23.959
And these prostitutes, you never
slept with any of them, either?

36:24.000 --> 36:25.342
I believe I've already
admitted to that.

36:25.400 --> 36:26.731
Oh, well, good, good,

36:26.790 --> 36:28.041
at least you
admitted to that.

36:28.090 --> 36:30.229
That makes it okay, then.Objection.

36:30.270 --> 36:32.044
PETER:
What I don't understand
is what this has to do

36:32.100 --> 36:33.920
with my performance
as the state's attorney.

36:33.970 --> 36:35.699
Because your performance
is directly connected

36:35.750 --> 36:37.354
to your actions
before and after.

36:37.410 --> 36:38.707
You said yourself you
learned from your mistakes,

36:38.760 --> 36:40.887
that's why you were
such a diligent S.A.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.147
Objection, Your Honor.
Where is the question?

36:42.200 --> 36:43.713
CONNOR:
Here it is.

36:43.760 --> 36:46.069
You have lied so much,
Mr. Florrick,

36:46.110 --> 36:48.544
why should any of us
ever believe you again?

36:48.590 --> 36:50.376
Because I went to prison.

36:50.420 --> 36:52.547
Because I was wrongly convicted.

36:52.600 --> 36:53.760
I didn't ask
for a speech...

36:53.820 --> 36:55.469
You asked a question.

36:55.510 --> 36:58.035
I'm answering it.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.336
Am I a flawed
individual?

37:01.390 --> 37:04.166
Yes.

37:04.220 --> 37:08.042
Have I done things in my
personal life thatI regret?

37:09.610 --> 37:12.613
Yes, deeply.

37:12.660 --> 37:14.480
But I never wanted anyone

37:14.530 --> 37:17.260
to go through what
I went through

37:17.320 --> 37:20.960
and that is why I was
a hard-ass state's attorney.

37:21.020 --> 37:23.750
That's why I threw out
bad confessions.

37:23.800 --> 37:26.758
That's why I
micromanaged.

37:29.680 --> 37:33.116
But that's when
I was at my best.

37:33.160 --> 37:36.209
That's when I was
most honorable.

37:45.170 --> 37:46.774
CUESTA:
The 12 of you should give fair

37:46.820 --> 37:48.993
and equal consideration
to all the evidence

37:49.040 --> 37:51.474
and deliberate with the goal
of reaching an agreement.

37:51.530 --> 37:52.918
Your sole interest

37:52.960 --> 37:55.212
is to determine
whether the government

37:55.270 --> 37:58.444
has proved its case
beyond a reasonable doubt.

37:58.490 --> 38:00.526
Good luck.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.406
Now, the stairs will start here

38:05.450 --> 38:07.099
and expand out
as they get higher,

38:07.150 --> 38:09.368
connecting to the north side
of the 29th floor...

38:09.410 --> 38:11.401
And it will be all woman,

38:11.460 --> 38:13.894
from the north
to the south.
David, just go
back to your office.

38:13.940 --> 38:15.191
I will, as soon as you sign
this EEOC complaint.

38:15.240 --> 38:16.935
Oh, come on, David.

38:16.990 --> 38:19.026
What? I have just as much
right to complain

38:19.070 --> 38:20.241
as any minority.

38:20.290 --> 38:22.599
MAN:
Ms. Lockhart?DIANE: Yes.

38:22.640 --> 38:24.198
I'm Greg Cady from the
Department of Buildings.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.775
I'm here for a Certificate
of Occupancy inspection.

38:26.820 --> 38:28.424
And we've run into
an issue of compliance.

38:28.480 --> 38:29.868
Meaning?

38:29.910 --> 38:31.901
Meaning somebody
on your demolition crew

38:31.960 --> 38:33.734
took out the load-bearing wall

38:33.780 --> 38:34.781
for the 29th floor.

38:34.830 --> 38:36.218
DIANE:
They did?CADY: Yes.

38:36.270 --> 38:37.783
Does that mean our new floor
could come

38:37.830 --> 38:39.388
crashing down on our heads?Yes.

38:39.440 --> 38:41.874
You're kidding.No, unfortunately.

38:41.920 --> 38:43.922
You'll have to evacuate
to the 27th floor.

38:43.970 --> 38:45.961
Uh... when?

38:46.010 --> 38:47.614
Now.

38:47.670 --> 38:48.967
[elevator bell dings]

38:58.510 --> 39:00.762
[sighs]

39:02.200 --> 39:04.589
[phones ringing,
indistinct chatter]

39:13.390 --> 39:14.823
CONNOR:
Two years.

39:14.870 --> 39:16.212
I came down from eight.
I'm not going lower.

39:16.260 --> 39:17.431
I'd rather see
what the jury does.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.209
And you know the jury

39:19.260 --> 39:20.602
will probably do a lot more.

39:20.660 --> 39:22.082
I'll ask him.

39:22.140 --> 39:23.823
If I were you, I'd do
a lot more than ask.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.097
Take it to him.

39:25.140 --> 39:27.745
And sell it.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.927
Before the jury comes back.

39:33.020 --> 39:34.009
We're not giving up.

39:34.060 --> 39:35.186
We're working
different angles.

39:35.240 --> 39:36.662
Mike T_as_cioni found
a criminal case

39:36.720 --> 39:38.324
against an SA.
in DuPage County

39:38.370 --> 39:40.804
in '98 that was
thrown out.

39:40.850 --> 39:42.408
He thinks we can mine it
for a precedent.

39:42.460 --> 39:43.540
Eli, can you give us a minute?

39:47.120 --> 39:48.508
Yes, of course.

39:48.560 --> 39:49.766
I'm so sorry.

39:49.820 --> 39:51.071
[footfalls receding]

39:53.600 --> 39:54.942
[glasses clink]

39:59.300 --> 40:00.517
[cork pops]

40:07.310 --> 40:10.222
Can I make a confession to you?

40:10.270 --> 40:13.398
Sure.

40:13.450 --> 40:16.089
I never liked wine.

40:17.500 --> 40:19.456
I only drank it
'cause you liked it.

40:19.500 --> 40:20.888
I was always
a Scotch guy.

40:20.940 --> 40:22.669
I guess I inherited that
from my father.

40:22.720 --> 40:23.937
[laughs]

40:23.980 --> 40:25.675
Well, I can fix you a Scotch.

40:25.720 --> 40:26.937
No.

40:26.980 --> 40:28.504
It's grown on me.

40:35.820 --> 40:39.039
Two years.

40:40.520 --> 40:42.249
Oh, God...

40:42.300 --> 40:43.858
I was in there for
only eight months

40:43.910 --> 40:45.309
and almost died.

40:45.350 --> 40:47.136
Wait for the verdict, Peter.

40:47.180 --> 40:48.738
I do that,

40:48.790 --> 40:51.258
I may actually die in prison.

40:51.310 --> 40:52.527
Ten years.

40:56.270 --> 40:57.749
What did you think of the jury?

41:00.020 --> 41:02.238
I think they were judging us.

41:02.280 --> 41:05.238
But I think your speech
at the end went over well.

41:06.940 --> 41:08.589
I was always good with a speech.

41:11.120 --> 41:14.760
There's no good answer,
is there?

41:17.300 --> 41:19.689
I don't know
what to say.

41:24.430 --> 41:26.773
I'm not good at gambling.

41:30.480 --> 41:32.914
Don't decide yet, Peter.

41:32.960 --> 41:35.269
The jury's retired.

41:35.310 --> 41:38.609
Just... sleep on it.

41:42.060 --> 41:43.755
I'm gonna take the deal.

41:47.590 --> 41:49.546
It's the smart
thing to do.

41:51.590 --> 41:53.103
Two years.

41:55.070 --> 41:57.288
I'll get out,

41:57.340 --> 41:59.763
write a book,
start over.

42:02.430 --> 42:05.126
Are you gonna
come visit me?

42:05.170 --> 42:06.649
I will.

42:09.740 --> 42:12.527
The hardest thing
is being forgotten.

42:14.270 --> 42:19.173
I won't forget.

42:19.230 --> 42:20.527
Okay.

42:23.880 --> 42:25.188
[sighs]

42:25.230 --> 42:27.232
[phone buzzes]

42:34.070 --> 42:35.970
What?

42:36.030 --> 42:38.191
The jury's back.
