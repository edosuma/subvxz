33:05.775 --> 33:07.610
YOU SOLD CHRISSY'S GUITAR
THIS MORNING --

33:07.610 --> 33:08.611

33:08.611 --> 33:10.947
YOU'RE ON THE HOOK NOW.

33:10.947 --> 33:13.366
SO THE REST OF OUR TIME
IN THIS ROOM TOGETHER

33:13.366 --> 33:16.119
SHOULD BE SPENT
ON HOW YOU CAN MINIMIZE

33:16.119 --> 33:18.788
THE YEARS YOU'RE
GONNA SPEND IN JAIL.

33:18.788 --> 33:22.041
AND YOU SHOULD START
WITH HOW YOU DIDN'T
MEAN TO KILL CHRISSY,

33:22.041 --> 33:25.253
'CAUSE ANYBODY
THIS SLOPPY AND STUPID
DIDN'T PREMEDITATE IT

33:25.253 --> 33:26.045
I DIDN'T.

33:26.045 --> 33:28.381
GOOD. THAT'S BIG
WHEN IT'S ACCIDENTAL.

33:28.381 --> 33:29.716

33:29.716 --> 33:32.218
EVERYBODY WAS SUPPOSED TO BE
AT THE GIG,

33:32.218 --> 33:35.471
AND I WENT IN THERE JUST TO GRAB
UP THE JEWELRY.

33:35.471 --> 33:36.806
CHRISSY WALKS IN.

33:36.806 --> 33:38.725
YEAH, AND IT'S 5:00 A.M.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.476
AND I'M TEARING THROUGH
HER NIGHTSTAND.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.562
SHE STARTS SCREAMING.

33:42.562 --> 33:44.731
"SON OF A BITCH!
SON OF A BITCH!"

33:44.731 --> 33:45.898
SOMEBODY HEARS THAT,

33:45.898 --> 33:47.608
THEY'RE GONNA CALL THE COPS,

33:47.608 --> 33:49.360

TO SHUT HER UP,

33:49.360 --> 33:52.447

SHE AIN'T BREATHING.

33:52.447 --> 33:53.865

33:53.865 --> 33:57.702

WASTED THROUGH ALL THIS.

THE FIRE?

34:00.371 --> 34:02.665

AND LIGHTER FLUID.

PROBABLY TRACE THE GUITAR.

PROBLEM FOR, LIKE, 10 YEARS.

OF THE APARTMENT,

35:05.478 --> 35:08.231

WALKED IN ON IT.

GONNA GO AT THIS GUY?

YOU'RE NOT READY

THE OPPORTUNITY
TO DO HIS JOB,

IN THAT APARTMENT.

YOU KNOW YOU
WERE THERE, KEITH.

TO PULL SOME HAIR SAMPLES

AND GET SOME FINGERPRINTS,

IS GONNA TAKE AN EARLY DINNER,

FOR YOU RIGHT NOW

37:16.400 --> 37:18.486
IS GET YOUR STATEMENT HOW
THIS WAS A ROBBERY,

AND HIS SISTER, YOU KNOW, CAME
AT YOU OR I DON'T KNOW WHAT,

37:22.114 --> 37:24.367

AND YOU REACTED,

TO GO THAT FAR.

STATEMENT, I CAN GET YOU

FOR HIM AS I AM FOR YOU.
