12:12.834 --> 12:15.208
I wanted to thank
you for taking care

12:15.291 --> 12:18.208
of Daryll while
I was in the joint.
Oh. Eh.

12:23.333 --> 12:26.333
Mickey.

12:26.417 --> 12:27.959
Look at you.

12:28.041 --> 12:29.125
Jesus.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.000
Claudette.
(chuckles)

12:33.250 --> 12:34.375
Claudette,

12:34.458 --> 12:37.000
you look great.
Oh.

12:37.083 --> 12:38.542
You haven't changed a bit.

12:38.625 --> 12:40.667
That's nice of you to say that.

12:40.750 --> 12:42.792
Black don't crack.
Oh.

12:42.875 --> 12:45.041
(chuckles)
Come on in, guys.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.458
Uh, can I offer you
a, uh, beer?

12:47.542 --> 12:50.542
Some lemonade?
Come on in.

12:55.417 --> 12:58.000
It's so beautiful.

12:58.083 --> 12:59.667
I mean, my God.

12:59.750 --> 13:01.917
Do you know where your father
and I went to school?

13:02.000 --> 13:03.583
Ah, come on.
Southie.

13:03.667 --> 13:06.709
Broken windows, all the desks
had graffiti on them.

13:06.792 --> 13:09.792
Yeah, Southie. We know, Mom.
Will you look at this place?

13:11.000 --> 13:12.834
Why am I so nervous?

13:12.917 --> 13:15.709
Relax. You're the best looking
woman here.

13:15.792 --> 13:18.583
(quietly):
What's he doing here?

13:18.667 --> 13:20.166
Shit.

13:20.250 --> 13:23.083
Uh, th-this is the time
that we're... What?

13:23.166 --> 13:25.208
Ray.

13:25.291 --> 13:26.750
I mean, you don't call,
you don't write.

13:26.834 --> 13:27.208
I mean, what am I...
(chuckles)

13:27.291 --> 13:29.875
Hello, Stu.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.542
Hello, Abby.

13:31.625 --> 13:34.000
You look
lovely today.

13:34.083 --> 13:36.000
And these are your...

13:36.083 --> 13:38.250
kids, right?
Yeah.

13:38.333 --> 13:39.583
My son goes here.

13:39.667 --> 13:40.834
Oh, yeah?
Yeah.

13:40.917 --> 13:42.208
He's leading the tours. Jamie,

13:42.291 --> 13:44.041
get over here.

13:48.291 --> 13:49.667
Just drop her.
What?

13:49.750 --> 13:54.000
Dr-Drop her
and do him instead.

13:54.083 --> 13:56.291
(sighs)
Okay, kid.

13:56.375 --> 13:57.500
Come on with me.

13:58.709 --> 14:00.250
We're gonna sign in.

14:00.333 --> 14:01.709
All right.
All right.

14:01.792 --> 14:04.000
Come here.

14:04.083 --> 14:05.917
That crazy cunt Ashley--

14:06.000 --> 14:08.625
why I keep fucking her,
ah, I can't explain.

14:08.709 --> 14:11.000
What's the problem, Stu?

14:11.083 --> 14:14.041
You know, when I tell
her I'm leaving my wife,

14:14.125 --> 14:15.792
she actually believes me.

14:15.875 --> 14:18.667
Yeah, she's bat-shit crazy,
even for an actress.

14:18.750 --> 14:19.834
Singer.

14:19.917 --> 14:21.750
What-Whatever
the fuck she is.

14:21.834 --> 14:26.458
But two nights
ago, right...

14:26.542 --> 14:28.000
she breaks into my house

14:28.083 --> 14:30.417
and leaves a note for me
in the goddamn kitchen.

14:30.500 --> 14:32.333
Freaked out my wife.

14:32.417 --> 14:35.417
You think I need
full-time security now

14:35.500 --> 14:39.291
or what, you know?

14:39.375 --> 14:40.125
No.

14:40.208 --> 14:43.959
You gonna take care
of this for me?

14:44.041 --> 14:46.417
I'm not working today, Stu.

14:54.792 --> 14:58.166
(sighs heavily)

14:58.250 --> 14:59.333
Want to go in?

14:59.417 --> 15:00.625
Yeah.

15:00.709 --> 15:02.458
Let's go.

15:02.542 --> 15:04.375
What did he want?

15:04.458 --> 15:05.667
Relationship advice.

15:05.750 --> 15:08.000
(snickers)

15:08.083 --> 15:09.625
Here at Bel Air Academy,

15:09.709 --> 15:12.041
on a daily basis,
we dwell in possibility.

15:12.125 --> 15:16.792
We meet our students afresh
every day and ask them

15:16.875 --> 15:19.125
to step up to the smorgasbord
of learning and then watch

15:19.208 --> 15:22.041
as they assemble the toolkits
for their futures.

15:22.125 --> 15:25.291
Our students are
well-rounded achievers...

15:25.375 --> 15:26.000
(whispers):
Can you believe this?

15:26.083 --> 15:27.959
(whispers):
Yeah, looks great.

15:28.041 --> 15:29.875
...artistic and scientific.

15:29.959 --> 15:32.000
(mouthing)
Bel Air graduates have made

15:32.083 --> 15:33.625
a significant contribution
to our country.

15:33.709 --> 15:35.709
(cell phone vibrating)

15:35.792 --> 15:37.792
Turn it off.

15:37.875 --> 15:38.291
(vibrating stops)

15:38.375 --> 15:41.000
Ray.

15:41.083 --> 15:44.166
And our wonderful faculty
is the bedrock of our success,

15:44.250 --> 15:47.792
inspiring our students
to build their own lives...

15:49.583 --> 15:52.041
What's going on, Avi?

15:52.125 --> 15:53.500
Yeah, they're in Palm Springs.

15:53.583 --> 15:55.000
What the fuck
are they doing there?

15:55.083 --> 15:58.417
Visiting some rich guy
and his black wife.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.959
Claudette.

16:01.041 --> 16:02.875
You think he's gonna run?

16:02.959 --> 16:05.792
I need him back in L.A.
for the warrant.

16:05.875 --> 16:08.166
But what if he doesn't come back
to L.A.?

16:08.250 --> 16:11.375
We need him back in L.A., Av.

16:11.458 --> 16:13.208
Okay, Ray.

16:15.375 --> 16:16.375
(sighs)

16:16.458 --> 16:18.375
How's it feel to be out, Mick?

16:18.458 --> 16:18.959
Great.

16:19.041 --> 16:21.250
Back with my family,

16:21.333 --> 16:23.834
where I belong.

16:24.709 --> 16:27.375
Leave that shit alone.

16:29.208 --> 16:30.542
Knock it off.

16:33.625 --> 16:37.041
I've been saving this bottle
of cognac for years.

16:37.125 --> 16:38.458
1946.

16:38.542 --> 16:40.041
Very rare.

16:40.125 --> 16:43.417
MICKEY: How much
does a bottle like that

16:43.500 --> 16:45.250
set you back?

16:45.333 --> 16:47.625
Well, you know the old saying:
if you have to ask,

16:47.709 --> 16:50.250
you can't afford it.

16:50.333 --> 16:52.000
I know the saying.

16:53.875 --> 16:58.250
Cost me $2,000 when I bought it

16:58.333 --> 17:00.291
back in '95.

17:00.375 --> 17:01.667
What is this, like,

17:01.750 --> 17:02.917
oil in your hair?

17:03.000 --> 17:04.291
Touching me--
It's product.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.000
Product?
I'm not telling you again.

17:06.083 --> 17:07.458
It's him.
It's gross.

17:13.625 --> 17:14.750
This one's not
having any.

17:14.834 --> 17:17.166
He's, uh, sober.

17:17.834 --> 17:21.125
Though he doesn't act it.

17:25.375 --> 17:27.625
ALLAN:
The secret to happiness...

17:27.709 --> 17:30.041
is freedom.

17:30.125 --> 17:32.875
Here's to your new life, Mick.

17:36.792 --> 17:39.458
Fucking good toast, Allan.

17:39.542 --> 17:40.875
Thank you.

17:41.917 --> 17:43.166
(sighs)

17:45.875 --> 17:47.083
Sip it, Daryll.

17:47.875 --> 17:50.625
Come on. Take it easy.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.583
He flips
from the fire escape,

17:57.667 --> 17:58.792
pulls out the pistol
from the cop's holster

17:58.875 --> 18:01.208
and shoots three guys dead.

18:01.291 --> 18:02.500
And all in his underwear,

18:02.583 --> 18:04.208
because he was making out
with that chick

18:04.291 --> 18:04.792
when the bad guys found him.

18:04.875 --> 18:07.583
Tommy Wheeler is badass.

18:07.667 --> 18:10.083
Hey, guys,

18:10.166 --> 18:11.834
Tommy Wheeler's, like,
one of my best friends.

18:11.917 --> 18:13.417
Tommy Wheeler?
Bullshit.

18:13.500 --> 18:17.375
I'm serious. My dad works with
him, and we talk all the time.

18:17.458 --> 18:17.875
No fucking way.

18:17.959 --> 18:20.709
I can prove it.

18:31.750 --> 18:34.500
That could be anyone.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.959
It's not though. I could call
him right now and he'd pick up.

18:37.041 --> 18:38.583
Do it then.

18:38.667 --> 18:41.125
Yeah. Do it.

18:41.208 --> 18:43.667
Come on.
Go ahead.

18:43.750 --> 18:44.917
Nah, mm-mm.

18:45.000 --> 18:47.208
Put it on speaker.

18:47.291 --> 18:49.166
(line ringing)

18:49.250 --> 18:49.709
TOMMY:
Little dude, what's up?

18:49.792 --> 18:51.083
Hey, Tommy.

18:51.166 --> 18:54.709
Just looking for a
new school and shit.

18:54.792 --> 18:56.041
Cool. Did you see my movie yet?

18:56.125 --> 18:57.834
Nope, not yet, but I'm gonna.

18:57.917 --> 18:58.542
Well, come to my house,
and I'll screen it for you.

18:58.625 --> 19:01.125
Tell your dad.

19:01.208 --> 19:02.083
Okay.

19:02.166 --> 19:03.542
I got to go.

19:03.625 --> 19:05.375
Okay, little man. See ya.

19:05.458 --> 19:06.792
Bye.

19:06.875 --> 19:08.250
Did, uh...

19:08.333 --> 19:10.375
Tommy Wheeler
suck your dick yet?

19:10.458 --> 19:11.542
What?

19:11.625 --> 19:12.875
My dad produces his movies.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.125
Says he's a degenerate homo.

19:14.208 --> 19:16.250
So if Tommy wants
to hang out with you,

19:16.333 --> 19:19.208
he's just trying
to get into your pants.

19:19.291 --> 19:20.750
He's a total perv.

19:20.834 --> 19:22.917
(boys chuckling, murmuring)

19:31.875 --> 19:33.542
MAN:
I'm sure most of you took

19:33.625 --> 19:35.083
the requisite
Shakespeare courses in college.

19:35.166 --> 19:39.333
Our curriculum begins
with Hamlet.

19:39.417 --> 19:41.291
After all, he was a teenager

19:41.375 --> 19:42.917
who hated his mother
and stepfather.

19:43.000 --> 19:44.417
(parents chuckling,
cell phone vibrating)

19:44.500 --> 19:48.041
After Hamlet, we move on
to Romeo and Juliet--

19:48.125 --> 19:50.750
more teenage angst.

19:50.834 --> 19:52.083
Uh, it's an easier sell

19:52.166 --> 19:53.917
before we move on
to the histories.

19:54.000 --> 19:55.750
We start with
the English histories,

19:55.834 --> 19:58.625
do Richard II, Henry V.

19:58.709 --> 20:00.917
And if that doesn't kill them,

20:01.000 --> 20:02.250
we're gonna move on
to the Roman histories next.

20:02.333 --> 20:05.917
We're gonna have Coriolanus,
Julius Caesar.

20:06.000 --> 20:08.166
Of course, at that point,
they'll be begging

20:08.250 --> 20:10.625
for nonstop Simpsons reruns.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.000
(parents chuckling)

20:12.083 --> 20:14.375
GIRL:
So, basically,

20:14.458 --> 20:16.792
they have to accept me
because of my father.

20:16.875 --> 20:19.041
But I still have to take
that stupid entrance exam.

20:19.125 --> 20:20.417
Oh, my God, I know.

20:20.500 --> 20:22.417
I had two private teachers
last time,

20:22.500 --> 20:24.125
and I still totally tanked.
(laughs)

20:24.208 --> 20:26.041
Are you flying to Aspen
for the holiday?

20:26.125 --> 20:27.542
No. I get so airsick

20:27.625 --> 20:29.333
flying out of
Santa Monica airport.

20:29.417 --> 20:32.250
I know! My ears go crazy
and all the food platters fall.

20:32.333 --> 20:33.208
(groans)

20:33.291 --> 20:34.500
Do you go to Aspen?

20:34.583 --> 20:35.208
Uh, no.

20:35.291 --> 20:38.250
Oh, my God.
Are those Keds?

20:38.333 --> 20:40.375
Yeah. Yes.

20:40.458 --> 20:41.709
You are so lucky.

20:41.792 --> 20:43.625
My mother refuses
to buy them for me

20:43.709 --> 20:46.041
because she thinks they don't
have arch support. (chuckles)

20:46.125 --> 20:47.959
Yeah. You must have
really good feet.

20:48.041 --> 20:49.959
Maybe. Thanks.

20:50.041 --> 20:51.709
Where do you
go to school?

20:51.792 --> 20:53.834
Calabasas.

20:53.917 --> 20:54.917
Oh, my God.
(laughs)

20:55.000 --> 20:56.250
What?

20:56.333 --> 20:57.625
You are so lucky.

20:57.709 --> 20:59.000
No one would even
know you here.

20:59.083 --> 21:02.125
You could, like,
be anyone.

21:03.959 --> 21:06.083
(quietly):
Hmm.

21:09.291 --> 21:11.667
TERRY:
Dip, slip, punch.

21:11.750 --> 21:13.458
Sit down in
your punches.

21:16.709 --> 21:18.500
Okay, boss, you tell me.

21:24.166 --> 21:25.625
Yeah, it's good.

21:25.709 --> 21:29.500
Good? My Aunt Keithie taught me
how to make this.

21:29.583 --> 21:31.166
She was a ugly woman

21:31.250 --> 21:33.375
with tits that hung down
to her belly button.

21:33.458 --> 21:34.000
I said it was good.

21:34.083 --> 21:36.333
And she was mean
as hell.

21:36.417 --> 21:37.834
But she cooked so good

21:37.917 --> 21:40.333
that she actually got six men
to marry her.

21:40.417 --> 21:41.458
So?
So...

21:41.542 --> 21:44.917
if this recipe got
my Aunt Keithie laid,

21:45.000 --> 21:46.291
it should work for you, too.

21:46.375 --> 21:48.166
Keep your eyes on the target.

21:48.250 --> 21:51.458
You're very fucking welcome.

21:54.834 --> 21:56.542
Time!

21:57.959 --> 22:00.834
(makes whooshing sounds)

22:00.917 --> 22:02.834
You wanna go?
You wanna go?

22:02.917 --> 22:04.166
Let's do this, huh?

22:04.250 --> 22:05.291
Get out of here.

22:05.375 --> 22:06.917
Come on.
(laughs)

22:13.834 --> 22:15.166
Fuck!

22:15.250 --> 22:17.125
(laughs)

22:17.208 --> 22:18.875
Jesus, Bunch!

22:18.959 --> 22:20.750
You got my
fucking hair wet!

22:20.834 --> 22:21.583
So what?

22:21.667 --> 22:23.000
So what?!
I got product in it!

22:23.083 --> 22:25.083
I told you that!

22:25.166 --> 22:28.000
What's your problem?

22:28.083 --> 22:28.583
Bunch!

22:30.917 --> 22:34.000
You motherfucker!

22:41.709 --> 22:44.083
Fucking asshole, I told you
I didn't want to get wet!

22:44.166 --> 22:47.959
Come on. Come on. Come on.

22:49.041 --> 22:49.959
Huh?

22:50.041 --> 22:51.583
Cut it out, man.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.875
So, you're a movie
producer, huh?

22:57.959 --> 22:59.458
Mm-hmm.

23:01.500 --> 23:03.625
Ever make anything good?

23:03.709 --> 23:05.000
Good?
(chuckles)

23:05.083 --> 23:06.417
I don't know
about that.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.959
Made a hell of a lot of
fucking money though,

23:09.041 --> 23:10.834
if that's what
you're asking.

23:10.917 --> 23:11.875
If you ever need
a great idea,

23:11.959 --> 23:15.000
I got one.

23:15.083 --> 23:17.000
Yeah?
Oh, yeah.

23:17.083 --> 23:18.875
I got a fucking doozy
in my head.

23:18.959 --> 23:20.834
Just need someone
to spill it out to.

23:20.917 --> 23:21.417
What's it about?

23:21.500 --> 23:25.041
It's about some guy...

23:25.125 --> 23:27.750
who did 20 years

23:27.834 --> 23:29.125
for no good fucking reason.

23:29.208 --> 23:31.625
I heard about that, Mick.

23:33.250 --> 23:35.583
You here for the money?

23:35.667 --> 23:37.458
What money?

23:37.542 --> 23:40.834
(laughs)

23:42.750 --> 23:45.250
Claudette and I have no secrets
from each other.

23:45.333 --> 23:48.000
I know all about Boston.

23:48.083 --> 23:50.750
I know about the money
you gave her,

23:50.834 --> 23:52.417
and I know where you got it.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.166
Yeah?
Mm-hmm.

23:54.250 --> 23:57.500
I'm prepared to pay you back.

23:57.583 --> 23:59.083
If?

23:59.166 --> 24:01.667
You know the if, Mick.

24:01.750 --> 24:06.583
You get your money
and you move on down the road.

24:06.667 --> 24:10.500
It ain't the money I'm after,
Allan.

24:11.333 --> 24:13.917
You two having a good time?

24:14.000 --> 24:15.208
Mm-hmm.

24:15.291 --> 24:18.375
Come here.
Come here.

24:20.750 --> 24:24.041
Look-look at this.

24:24.125 --> 24:28.291
Ray's family.

24:28.375 --> 24:30.834
They're beautiful!

24:30.917 --> 24:32.208
They can't get
enough of me.

24:32.291 --> 24:33.542
Who'd have thought, huh?

24:33.625 --> 24:33.917
Oh...
(chuckles)

24:34.000 --> 24:36.834
Excuse me.

24:39.709 --> 24:41.333
WOMAN:
Don't fucking move!

24:41.417 --> 24:42.667
MAN:
Ah, yeah!

24:42.750 --> 24:43.083
WOMAN:
Don't move!

24:43.166 --> 24:45.917
(bed creaking)

24:46.000 --> 24:46.667
(woman gasps)

24:46.750 --> 24:49.583
There-- Oh, God, there it is.

24:49.667 --> 24:51.709
(moaning)

24:51.792 --> 24:54.250
Don't move! (gasps)

24:54.333 --> 24:57.333
Make... me... fucking...

24:57.417 --> 24:58.291
feel good!

24:58.375 --> 24:59.375
(moaning loudly)

24:59.458 --> 25:02.458
(shrieks)
What the fuck's that, Teddy?!

25:02.542 --> 25:03.875
TEDDY: What?!
Oh, shit.

25:03.959 --> 25:04.500
What the fuck is that?

25:04.583 --> 25:06.959
WOMAN:
I don't know.

25:07.041 --> 25:09.959
Shit.

25:10.041 --> 25:12.083
(line ringing)

25:12.166 --> 25:14.083
Come on, Ray.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.083
(phone vibrating)

25:15.166 --> 25:16.458
Turn it off.

25:16.542 --> 25:18.542
So what do you think?

25:18.625 --> 25:20.083
About?

25:20.166 --> 25:21.417
You want to go steady?

25:21.500 --> 25:23.083
My mom says you're
gonna lead me

25:23.166 --> 25:23.875
down the wrong path.

25:23.959 --> 25:25.917
All right,
so don't tell your mom.

25:26.000 --> 25:28.333
Okay.

25:28.417 --> 25:29.500
But I'm a good
Catholic girl.

25:29.583 --> 25:33.583
Everything's got to
be over my sweater.

25:33.667 --> 25:34.792
I can do that.

25:53.083 --> 25:54.917
MAN:
Hey.

25:56.083 --> 25:57.542
It's Ray Donovan.

25:57.625 --> 26:00.792
Errand boy
for Ezra Goldman.

26:00.875 --> 26:03.625
You mind?

26:03.709 --> 26:06.625
Trying to have a cup
of coffee with my wife.

26:06.709 --> 26:09.291
So, you, uh, you bringing
your kids around here

26:09.375 --> 26:11.667
to run errands, too?

26:11.750 --> 26:13.291
Pick up the trays
after lunch,

26:13.375 --> 26:15.083
maybe extort lunch money
from the other kids?

26:15.166 --> 26:16.542
Who the fuck
do you think you are?!

26:16.625 --> 26:17.709
Whoa, whoa.

26:18.875 --> 26:19.208
It's all right.

26:19.291 --> 26:21.375
You don't...

26:21.458 --> 26:23.125
talk to my husband like that.

26:23.208 --> 26:25.709
Listen,

26:25.792 --> 26:29.625
I'm being nice
'cause we're in a nice place.

26:29.709 --> 26:30.917
Understand me?

26:32.500 --> 26:35.834
Doesn't work like that
around here, Ray.

26:35.917 --> 26:39.417
You can't just
threaten people...

26:39.500 --> 26:41.583
get what you want.

26:44.291 --> 26:47.250
(phone vibrating)

26:48.458 --> 26:51.083
I'll be right back.

26:51.166 --> 26:52.667
Ray...

26:59.000 --> 27:02.041
My therapist said
I should apologize to you.

27:05.750 --> 27:07.792
Your therapist?

27:07.875 --> 27:09.583
What I said to you

27:09.667 --> 27:11.375
about Ray
fucking my girlfriend--

27:11.458 --> 27:13.041
it was totally untrue.

27:13.125 --> 27:15.041
I was acting out

27:15.125 --> 27:20.625
my guilt over having an affair
with a... a young girl.

27:20.709 --> 27:24.667
A beautiful young girl.

27:24.750 --> 27:28.250
I was acting it out on you,
and that was deeply wrong.

27:28.333 --> 27:31.208
And I apologize.

27:33.250 --> 27:35.500
Thank you.

27:35.583 --> 27:36.792
(chuckles)

27:39.000 --> 27:41.667
For your apology.

27:41.750 --> 27:44.875
You're welcome.

27:44.959 --> 27:48.083
And I'll put in a good word
about your kids.

27:48.166 --> 27:51.417
You know, just make sure
things work out.

27:55.583 --> 27:57.291
Good.

27:57.375 --> 27:58.667
Good, good, good, good.

27:58.750 --> 28:02.083
This... this feels good,
doesn't it?

28:02.166 --> 28:03.875
Right.

28:07.959 --> 28:08.917
How long ago did this happen?

28:09.000 --> 28:10.959
LENA: Uh, about ten minutes.
Who'd she call?

28:11.041 --> 28:13.875
She called the concierge
and then she called her lawyer.

28:13.959 --> 28:15.375
All right, I'll be right there.

28:15.458 --> 28:15.875
All right.

28:26.333 --> 28:27.709
Want me to call Ezra?

28:27.792 --> 28:29.166
No, don't bother him.

28:29.250 --> 28:30.792
I'll take care of it.

28:35.625 --> 28:37.208
You hotel security?

28:37.291 --> 28:38.875
Yeah.

28:38.959 --> 28:41.333
It's over here. I think
it's a microphone.

28:42.709 --> 28:44.166
Yeah, that's a microphone.

28:44.250 --> 28:45.125
Strangest thing.

28:45.208 --> 28:46.875
It just fell down from
behind the picture.

28:46.959 --> 28:48.458
I mean, I didn't
know who to call.

28:48.542 --> 28:52.166
What is this, like,
some CIA type of shit?

28:52.250 --> 28:54.166
This whole room
is wired?

28:56.959 --> 28:59.375
How do you know
where everything is?

28:59.458 --> 28:59.917
Excuse me.

29:03.667 --> 29:05.542
Can I see your I.D.?

29:09.625 --> 29:11.542
What are you...?

29:13.041 --> 29:14.959
What the fuck
you doing, man?!

29:18.917 --> 29:19.917
Fucking scumbag!

29:21.709 --> 29:23.625
(groans)
Sit.

29:23.709 --> 29:25.375
Fuck!

29:26.417 --> 29:26.667
You fucker!

29:26.750 --> 29:27.750
(grunts)

29:27.834 --> 29:29.959
You're gonna ruin
my goddamn life!

29:32.917 --> 29:33.166
(grunts)

29:33.250 --> 29:35.375
(shrieks)

29:39.333 --> 29:41.500
(groans)

29:44.709 --> 29:47.583
Wait, wait, wait,
wait, stop!

29:47.667 --> 29:48.834
Stop!

29:48.917 --> 29:51.291
Look at me!
Look at me!

29:53.083 --> 29:55.000
Listen to me.

29:55.083 --> 29:57.583
I am a human being.

29:57.667 --> 30:00.625
Do you ever think about
the things that you do?

30:00.709 --> 30:02.917
Listen. Do yourself...

30:03.000 --> 30:04.917
You bastard!
LENA: Hey.
Get to your room.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.375
No, I'm sorry, wait,
wait! I'll pay you!

30:06.458 --> 30:09.333
I'll do anything,
I'll do anything!
Calm down. Get to your room.

30:09.417 --> 30:10.834
Get to your room.
Oh, fuck you!

30:10.917 --> 30:11.625
Shut up.
You okay?

30:11.709 --> 30:13.041
Yeah.
Shit.

30:13.125 --> 30:15.750
All right.
We got to get
out of here. Go.

30:15.834 --> 30:19.625
Bel Air Academy costs
$33,000 a year in tuition.

30:19.709 --> 30:23.709
We have
a $10 million scholarship fund

30:23.792 --> 30:26.709
for students who can prove need.

30:26.792 --> 30:30.041
So, please, don't let our price
tag stop you from applying.

30:30.125 --> 30:31.709
Questions?

30:31.792 --> 30:33.583
MICKEY: Looks like
you landed on your feet.

30:33.667 --> 30:34.667
You gave me
a head start, Mickey.

30:34.750 --> 30:36.291
And I'll be forever grateful.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.417
Claudette...

30:38.500 --> 30:39.750
Come on.

30:39.834 --> 30:41.834
I got something for you.

30:41.917 --> 30:42.750
Oh.

30:42.834 --> 30:44.125
Uh-huh.
You do, huh?

30:44.208 --> 30:45.375
Yeah.

30:47.917 --> 30:48.250
Jesus.

30:48.333 --> 30:50.291
Pa-dow!

30:50.375 --> 30:51.250
You kept it.

30:51.333 --> 30:53.000
Here's your other
beautiful black baby.

30:53.083 --> 30:57.166
Ain't that something.
Ain't that something!
Mm-hmm.

30:58.667 --> 31:01.375
Holy shit.
My Sansui speakers!

31:01.458 --> 31:02.125
And there's more.

31:05.333 --> 31:06.750
Let's see if it's alive.

31:06.834 --> 31:08.625
(engine starts,
stereo playing R&B music)

31:08.709 --> 31:10.792
And more.

31:20.709 --> 31:22.750
(chuckles):
Oh, well...

31:22.834 --> 31:24.834
what are you gonna do?

31:25.750 --> 31:29.166
You like what you like.

31:29.250 --> 31:31.000

31:31.083 --> 31:34.291

33:39.291 --> 33:40.125

33:40.208 --> 33:43.750
That's Tommy Wheeler
sucking on your dick.

33:43.834 --> 33:45.083
MAN: All right, boys,
let's bring it in!

33:45.166 --> 33:46.667
(Jamie laughs)

33:46.750 --> 33:48.208
He'd do us all a favor
if we didn't go here.

You okay?

34:09.333 --> 34:10.875
Jamie, are you
all right?

34:10.959 --> 34:11.875
Did you fucking see that? Ah!

34:11.959 --> 34:16.333
Get back here,
you fucking asshole!

34:16.417 --> 34:18.291
(water running)

34:27.750 --> 34:29.458
(water stops)

34:38.375 --> 34:40.375
I was just running my mouth.

34:40.458 --> 34:43.458
Ezra, he...

34:43.542 --> 34:45.583
fucked me so badly
on my divorce.

34:45.667 --> 34:49.166
(sighs)

34:49.250 --> 34:52.250
I was just...

34:52.333 --> 34:53.250
running my mouth.

34:56.250 --> 34:57.333
(sighs)

35:25.291 --> 35:27.208
(playing mellow song)

35:30.792 --> 35:32.417
(singing quietly)

35:38.417 --> 35:40.709
(humming)

35:50.208 --> 35:52.500
That's great,
sweetheart.

35:52.583 --> 35:53.709
I always wanted to play
something that good.

35:53.792 --> 35:55.709
You play the piano.

35:55.792 --> 35:56.959
Yeah, three or four chords,

35:57.041 --> 35:59.375
but nothing like you.

36:01.250 --> 36:03.542
You like this place, don't you?

36:03.625 --> 36:06.208
I do, Daddy.

36:06.291 --> 36:08.709
If I applied,
do you think I'd get in?

36:08.792 --> 36:10.750
(scoffs)
I think they'd be lucky

36:10.834 --> 36:12.041
to have you,
that's what I think.

36:12.125 --> 36:13.792
Daddy, what happened
to your face?

36:13.875 --> 36:15.291
It's nothing.

36:15.375 --> 36:16.583
But...
Don't worry about it.

36:16.667 --> 36:19.667
It's nothing?
Nothing. Come on.

36:19.750 --> 36:22.375
Whatever you say.

36:22.458 --> 36:23.083
Big cat scratched me.

36:23.166 --> 36:24.959
(laughs)
A bobcat, maybe.

36:25.041 --> 36:28.375
One of those
Bel Air cougars.

36:28.458 --> 36:30.000
He hit me.
I know he did.

36:30.083 --> 36:31.250
I did not.

36:31.333 --> 36:33.417
He hit me!

36:33.500 --> 36:34.875
Conor, is this true?

36:34.959 --> 36:36.417
I don't know
what he's talking about.

36:36.500 --> 36:37.458
JAMIE:
He's a liar!

36:37.542 --> 36:38.709
He's a fucking liar!

36:38.792 --> 36:40.208
He hit me!
Do something about it.

36:40.291 --> 36:42.750
STU: All right,
Jamie, just calm down.

36:42.834 --> 36:44.875
So tell me exactly
what happened.

36:44.959 --> 36:46.083
I already did.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.583
We were walking
off the yard

36:47.667 --> 36:49.166
when this fucker hit me
with something.

36:49.250 --> 36:52.625
Well, I'm-I'm sure
it was an accident.

36:52.709 --> 36:55.208
JAMIE:
Just an accident, my ass.

36:56.083 --> 36:58.166
RAY:
Conor?

36:58.250 --> 37:00.959
I'm only gonna
ask you once.

37:01.041 --> 37:01.458
Did you hit him?

37:05.917 --> 37:08.417
Yeah, I hit him.

37:08.500 --> 37:09.667
And I don't give a shit!

37:09.750 --> 37:11.500
He's a fucking asshole!

37:11.583 --> 37:13.417
Come on, Bridget.

37:13.500 --> 37:15.458
Let's just go home.

37:19.333 --> 37:20.667
STU:
What the fuck, Ray?

37:26.542 --> 37:28.291
Walk away!

37:28.375 --> 37:30.250
Don't show your face here
again, bitch!

37:30.333 --> 37:32.792
Why'd you let him hit you?

37:32.875 --> 37:35.166
I didn't fucking see him.
He came up from behind me.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.583
(piano playing jazz music)

37:44.250 --> 37:45.083
(sighs)

37:45.166 --> 37:46.291
Means a lot to me--

37:46.375 --> 37:49.208
you boys coming
out here with me.

37:49.291 --> 37:52.000
It means a lot.

37:52.083 --> 37:54.333
Where's the fucking waiter?

37:54.417 --> 37:57.500
I need a new drink.

37:57.583 --> 38:00.458
(man singing jazz music)

38:00.542 --> 38:03.250
Ah, he's somewhere.

38:04.792 --> 38:06.250
(Darryl laughs)

38:07.208 --> 38:08.792
Oh, ho!

38:08.875 --> 38:12.000
(imitating Allan):
"Cost me $2,000 back in '95.

38:12.083 --> 38:15.291
"And if you have to ask me
how much it cost today,

38:15.375 --> 38:17.375
you can't afford it."
"You can't afford it!"

38:17.458 --> 38:19.542
(laughter)

38:19.625 --> 38:21.250
Go ahead, me, Bunch.

38:22.250 --> 38:24.083
"Sip it, Daryll,
come on."

38:24.166 --> 38:26.208
That's my boys.
"Come on!"

38:26.291 --> 38:29.041
Sip it my ass,
motherfucker.

38:32.458 --> 38:32.834
MICKEY:
Yes.

38:32.917 --> 38:36.083
To my seeds.

38:36.166 --> 38:38.166
Live forever.

38:41.709 --> 38:43.667

38:43.750 --> 38:45.709
(sighs)

38:45.792 --> 38:48.083
Whew.

38:48.166 --> 38:50.375
I got to go take a piss.

38:52.750 --> 38:54.875
(sniffs)

38:56.083 --> 38:59.333
Whoa, where
you going?

38:59.417 --> 39:00.750
Hey, come on.

39:00.834 --> 39:01.500
I'm fast.

how to cook like this?

42:38.417 --> 42:40.583
All right, Pie, that's enough!

43:15.875 --> 43:17.417
Potato Pie?

43:18.583 --> 43:21.667
How did you get
a name like that?

43:21.750 --> 43:26.125
See, when I was a kid,
I really liked pie.

43:26.208 --> 43:27.750
I mean, who doesn't?

43:27.834 --> 43:30.542
But I liked the
hell out of pie.

blueberry, pecan.

43:34.250 --> 43:35.542

sweet potato.
