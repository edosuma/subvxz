WEBVTT

00:05.667 --> 00:08.667
Sorry I'm late, everyone,
but I've got some big news.

00:09.041 --> 00:12.625
I've been studying acting
at the Even You Can Act Academy.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.333
Turns out even I can act.

00:16.458 --> 00:19.458
My teacher is Dan Lamont,
former star of "Beach Patrol."

00:19.542 --> 00:21.458
Oh, I loved "Beach Patrol."

00:21.709 --> 00:24.083
They had Loretta the talking dolphin.

00:24.166 --> 00:26.375
Hmm, that dolphin's all attitude.

00:26.458 --> 00:29.041
Talk to the fin
'cause the blowhole ain't listening.

00:30.291 --> 00:32.583
Dan Lamont's class is very exclusive.

00:32.667 --> 00:35.875
You have to go through an incredibly
rigorous selection process.

00:35.959 --> 00:38.667
By "rigorous" you mean
the free lesson coupon.

00:38.750 --> 00:40.208
Stuck under your windshield wiper?

00:40.709 --> 00:44.583
For your information, Dan himself told me
he thinks I have real talent.

00:45.041 --> 00:47.917
Here, let me show you guys an
exercise we learned today in class.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.375
It's called improv.

00:49.792 --> 00:51.417
- Improv?
That's right.

00:51.709 --> 00:53.500
No script, no problem.

00:53.583 --> 00:56.375
Just me alone,
pulling it out of my own brain.

00:56.709 --> 00:58.625
You'll be pulling it out of somewhere.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.458
Jack, be my scene partner.

01:01.542 --> 01:04.583
Not gonna happen, Rudy.
Acting is really not my thing.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.959
Don't worry.
Just let my talent drive the train.

01:08.291 --> 01:09.375
Rudy, Okay, here's the scene.

01:09.458 --> 01:10.959
We're in a...

01:13.166 --> 01:14.625
We're in a minimart.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.875
And you're the clerk and I'm...

01:22.834 --> 01:25.083
"ze" king of France.

01:25.166 --> 01:26.625
Ho-ho-ho-ho.

01:27.083 --> 01:29.709
Would you care for a candy bar?
They're king-sized.

01:29.792 --> 01:32.625
-
- <i>Oui, oui.</i>

01:32.917 --> 01:35.250
Sorry, you can't do that here.
Bathroom's broken.

01:37.625 --> 01:39.083
If you have to go wee-wee,

01:39.166 --> 01:41.250
you gotta hold it
till you get back to your own throne.

01:44.750 --> 01:45.959
And scene.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.667
- I said "and scene."
-

01:50.750 --> 01:52.750
That means the scene is over.

01:52.834 --> 01:54.834
You guys, he didn't even do an accent.

01:54.917 --> 01:57.417
It's not funny if you don't do an accent!

01:57.500 --> 02:00.583
-

02:45.500 --> 02:48.625
To be honest with you,
I just started acting.

02:48.709 --> 02:50.458
Are you sure you wanna be my manager?

02:51.333 --> 02:54.041
I'll say it again.
I wanna be in the Rudy business.

02:54.375 --> 02:56.959
I mean, dude, when I saw you
in that scene,

02:57.041 --> 02:59.250
I... I really thought
you were the king of France.

02:59.834 --> 03:01.375
I really took you there, huh?

03:01.792 --> 03:04.583
Took me there? Im still there,
sitting under the Eiffel tower,

03:04.667 --> 03:06.667
wearing a beret and eating smelly cheese.

03:07.709 --> 03:09.250
Rudy, I wanna be your people.

03:09.333 --> 03:12.166
I can't believe this. I have people.

03:15.959 --> 03:18.875
Quiet down, quiet down, everybody.

03:19.667 --> 03:24.542
Now as you know, the cake you've baked
will determine your final Home-ec grade.

03:25.250 --> 03:29.458
You know what I always say,
another day, another "A."

03:29.834 --> 03:33.250
You know what I always say,
you can't spell "Eddie" without "D"s.

03:36.542 --> 03:40.959
My gold fork and I will commence
the walk of taste.

03:42.542 --> 03:43.750
That's odd.

03:44.083 --> 03:47.917
Sponge cake does not contain
actual sponge.

03:48.959 --> 03:52.041
- "D-".
- Passed! Up top.

03:58.792 --> 04:03.125
Hmm. Dry, bland and unappetizing.

04:04.375 --> 04:05.250
Really?

04:05.959 --> 04:09.250
As unappetizing as you sunbathing.
In your bicycle shorts

04:09.333 --> 04:11.291
when you were supposed to be
at an assembly?

04:12.333 --> 04:14.542
"A+". Mr. Krupnick.

04:15.417 --> 04:16.917
Mr. Pedesta, sir,

04:17.417 --> 04:20.375
What you're about to taste
is not just a piece of cake,

04:20.917 --> 04:22.458
it's a piece of my heart.

04:23.083 --> 04:26.125
Students like you
are why I got into education

04:26.250 --> 04:27.709
and gave up Mexican wrestling.

04:42.458 --> 04:45.000
It looks like he's gonna need
that sponge after all.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.291
<i>♪ Hey ♪</i>

04:52.250 --> 04:53.709
<i>♪ Hey, come on... ♪</i>

04:54.458 --> 04:56.375

04:56.625 --> 04:59.500
-
- Uh, Rudy, what's going on?

04:59.834 --> 05:02.333
Jack, I'm very busy working
on my acting career.

05:02.417 --> 05:05.500
This is what they call in the biz
having my headshot.

05:06.542 --> 05:07.792
Is it cool if I worked out?

05:07.875 --> 05:09.834
I'm really close to nailing
a new bo staff routine.

05:10.166 --> 05:13.625
Fine. If you insist on doing karate
in this dojo, do it over there.

05:16.208 --> 05:17.500
All right, Lou,

05:17.583 --> 05:20.625
Once we start, I want you
to capture the many moods

05:20.709 --> 05:23.667
of the man I like to call Rud-ay.

05:46.250 --> 05:47.750
Jack, what did you do?

05:47.834 --> 05:50.083
I was in the middle of the forbidden pose.

05:51.041 --> 05:52.458
I'll tell you what he did.

05:52.834 --> 05:55.291
He threw his stick
at my camera and broke it.

05:55.375 --> 05:57.333
You are gonna get a bill from me, Rudy.

05:57.417 --> 05:59.709
I'm sorry. It was an accident.

05:59.792 --> 06:01.542
And I'll let you in on a little secret...

06:02.166 --> 06:05.208
The forbidden pose is forbidden
for a reason.

06:08.500 --> 06:10.959
I can't believe this.
Why would you do that?

06:11.041 --> 06:13.166
The bo staff just flew out of my hands.

06:13.875 --> 06:15.291
Rudy!

06:15.417 --> 06:18.083
Guess whose manager got their
superstar an audition.

06:18.458 --> 06:22.041
What's the part? I'll do anything,
even swimsuit work if it's tasteful.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.750
Who am I kidding?
It doesn't have to be tasteful.

06:25.250 --> 06:27.458
You're auditioning to be Pomegranate Man.

06:27.750 --> 06:30.417
He's a cape-wearing fruit,
but with attitude.

06:31.083 --> 06:32.542
That I can play.

06:33.250 --> 06:35.375
You're gonna kill it.
I hope you get it, man.

06:35.709 --> 06:37.417
- Thanks, Jack.
- Oh, yo,

06:37.500 --> 06:39.417
Pomegranate Man has to know martial arts.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.333
So I convinced the director
to come here tomorrow

06:41.417 --> 06:42.458
to show him what you can do.

06:46.375 --> 06:48.125
This is all happening so fast.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.417
Man's a star.

06:56.125 --> 06:58.458
My life is over.

06:58.792 --> 07:00.375
Don't you think you're overreacting?

07:00.500 --> 07:01.792
I certainly do not.

07:02.083 --> 07:05.041
Without that "A,"
that means I've lost my perfect G.P.A.

07:06.250 --> 07:08.625
Which means I'll never
become a thoracic surgeon.

07:09.375 --> 07:11.208
I'll go into a career tailspin.

07:11.250 --> 07:13.875
And end up selling shoes
at a ladies' sneaker outlet.

07:14.166 --> 07:17.625
I can't touch other people's feet.
I can't even touch my own.

07:18.959 --> 07:22.208
All right, Milton, I talked to Mr. Pedesta
in the nurse's office,

07:22.917 --> 07:27.041
and in-between barfs,
he told me you can retake the cake test.

07:27.125 --> 07:28.959
Oh, this is awesome.

07:29.417 --> 07:31.792
I'm gonna make a new cake
and it's gonna be perfect.

07:32.250 --> 07:35.583
When Pedesta tries it,
it'll caress the inside of his mouth.

07:35.667 --> 07:39.166
With the most sweet succulent moist...

07:39.208 --> 07:41.291
He's gonna taste it, Milton,
not make out with it.

07:45.792 --> 07:47.667
<i>♪ kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

07:47.750 --> 07:49.333
It's a good thing we're helping Milton.

07:49.750 --> 07:53.041
If he doesn't get the "A" this time,
he's going to flip out.

07:53.500 --> 07:55.500
I think that flip ship has already sailed.

07:56.333 --> 07:59.667
He stayed up all night watching that
angry English chef on the Food Channel.

08:01.166 --> 08:02.875
All righty-o!

08:03.667 --> 08:04.792
Let's get to cooking.

08:09.709 --> 08:11.375
Oh, come on!

08:11.834 --> 08:13.417
You call yourself a chef?

08:13.917 --> 08:16.583
This looks like it belongs in the loo.

08:17.667 --> 08:18.709
Is that good?

08:19.834 --> 08:21.208
Give me your apron.

08:24.875 --> 08:25.750
Now get out.

08:28.750 --> 08:29.625
Milton!

08:30.542 --> 08:33.583
Sift your flour!
Sift it, sift it, sift it!

08:39.208 --> 08:41.542
I am Pomegranate Man.

08:42.750 --> 08:45.291
I am Pomegranate Man!

08:46.625 --> 08:48.792
I am Pomegranate Man!

08:50.500 --> 08:52.208
Rudy, you've gotta calm down.

08:52.291 --> 08:55.583
I can't calm down.
There's so many ways to say things.

08:56.500 --> 09:00.000
Look, you can't freak out.
This is a huge opportunity.

09:00.083 --> 09:02.083
If you need me,
I'll be right next to you, okay?

09:02.709 --> 09:05.792
You're gonna love this guy.
Rudy, this is Terrence, your director.

09:06.166 --> 09:06.917
And this is Jack.

09:07.000 --> 09:08.250
- What's up, man?
- What's up, Jack?

09:08.333 --> 09:09.917
So, Rudy, you ready for this?

09:10.000 --> 09:12.125
I was born Rudy-- Uh, ready.

09:13.083 --> 09:16.333
Okay, this is Pomegranate Pow.

09:16.417 --> 09:19.250
It's a healthy drink
that helps kids perform at their best.

09:19.375 --> 09:20.917
So take a drink from the bottle,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.542
then say, "Now I'm ready
to take on the midday drowsies,"

09:24.625 --> 09:26.291
and then show me your best karate moves.

09:27.417 --> 09:28.583
Let's do this.

09:33.917 --> 09:35.500
And action.

09:35.583 --> 09:36.917
I'm sorry. What do you need me to do?

09:39.083 --> 09:41.333
- Show him what you can do, Rudy.
- Yeah.

09:41.417 --> 09:43.417
Oh, no, no, I... I got this.

09:47.000 --> 09:48.208
Ahh!

09:48.291 --> 09:51.542
Now I'm ready to take on
the midday drowsies!

10:00.875 --> 10:06.083
Yaah. Hoo-yaaahhhhh!

10:07.959 --> 10:09.166
Great work. We'll be in touch.

10:09.875 --> 10:12.417
Hey, hey, wait. He's got so much more,
so much more. Believe me.

10:12.500 --> 10:15.000
Hey, Rudy, do that move you invented.

10:15.083 --> 10:17.542
The scissor roll out dragon tail kick.
That'll shut him up.

10:17.625 --> 10:20.458
Right. I will now demonstrate...

10:20.834 --> 10:23.125
the scissor roll out dragon tail kick.

10:23.417 --> 10:24.458
That'll shut you up.

10:32.375 --> 10:33.500
Pretty cool, huh?

10:33.583 --> 10:35.583
He did it so fast,
you couldn't even see it.

10:36.333 --> 10:37.875
Jack, I can't remember the move.

10:37.959 --> 10:40.208
Rudy, it's so simple.
Just do as I do, okay? -Okay.

10:41.125 --> 10:42.208
- Ready?
- Yeah.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.083
Now I'm ready to take
on the midday drowsies!

10:47.208 --> 10:48.041
Pah!

10:50.041 --> 10:50.917
Pah!

10:53.458 --> 10:56.375
Stop! Audition's over.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.166
Jack, you got the part.

10:58.750 --> 10:59.667
What?

10:59.750 --> 11:01.959
You were sensational.

11:02.208 --> 11:04.250
I'll see you on set, Pomegranate Man.

11:05.959 --> 11:10.291
Aw, Rudy babe, that director's an idiot.

11:10.583 --> 11:12.333
You are perfect for this role.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.792
Jack babe, the director's a genius!

11:15.041 --> 11:17.083
You are perfect for this role.

11:27.458 --> 11:28.750
Why are the lights off in here?

11:33.959 --> 11:35.291
Bravo.

11:35.875 --> 11:39.333
Look who just walked in.
If it isn't Hollywood's new "It" boy.

11:40.625 --> 11:42.458
Rudy, why are you sitting alone
in the dark?

11:42.917 --> 11:45.375
It's only dark
because you turned off my star.

11:46.166 --> 11:48.041
Was it burning a little too bright
for you?

11:48.709 --> 11:50.375
Rudy, I was trying to help you.

11:50.500 --> 11:52.375
How? By stealing my career?

11:52.709 --> 11:56.166
What career? I've had zits
that lasted longer than your career.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.792
Ha, ha! Zits, that is fresh and funny.,

12:00.333 --> 12:01.583
Stop sucking up, Jerry.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.583
Yesterday you told me
I was fresh and funny.

12:03.917 --> 12:05.792
Yesterday, Rudy. Yesterday.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.041
You always have to be the star, Jack.

12:10.125 --> 12:12.583
That's why you sabotaged
my improv exercise,

12:12.667 --> 12:14.125
ruined my photoshoot,

12:14.208 --> 12:17.792
and took the role that I was born to play,
Pomegranate Guy.

12:17.875 --> 12:19.250
- Man.
- Man!

12:20.583 --> 12:23.166
Rudy, I don't even wanna be
in that dumb commercial.

12:23.250 --> 12:25.834
Good, because I forbid you from taking it.

12:28.834 --> 12:30.125
Excuse me?

12:31.750 --> 12:35.000
You know what?
Now I'm gonna do that commercial.

12:35.083 --> 12:38.083
And if you have a problem with it,
talk to my people!

12:40.000 --> 12:42.917
I don't believe it. You stole my people!

12:47.834 --> 12:49.750

12:49.834 --> 12:52.834

12:54.375 --> 12:56.750
I feel like a guy this ripped
shouldn't have to come here

12:56.834 --> 12:59.291
- sitting in your bike basket.
- All right, ah...

12:59.667 --> 13:00.959
Let's go over the concept.

13:01.041 --> 13:04.041
The whole city is being brought down

13:04.125 --> 13:08.333
by a big dark cloud
called the midday drowsies.

13:08.667 --> 13:10.917
Right, then I fly in
and defeat the drowsies

13:11.000 --> 13:13.291
with my signature Pomegranate Pow.

13:13.375 --> 13:15.917
Okay, now it's time for you
to meet your mortal enemy...

13:16.000 --> 13:17.375
The drowsies.

13:24.792 --> 13:27.250
Hello, Pomegranate Guy.

13:27.333 --> 13:29.166
- Man.
- Man!

13:38.875 --> 13:40.667
Hey, I think I'm getting the hang of this.

13:40.750 --> 13:44.166
- What do you think?
- Oh, come on!

13:44.583 --> 13:48.500
I think you should crawl back
to whatever slop kitchen you oozed out of.

13:50.542 --> 13:53.417
You know, Eddie and I were
trying to help you, Milton,

13:54.500 --> 13:57.125
but you're being a real jerk. Good luck.

13:59.375 --> 14:00.250
Kim, wait.

14:02.333 --> 14:04.583
I never got anything
other than "A"s before,

14:05.250 --> 14:09.041
it's driving me crazy that I can't do
something as easy as baking a cake.

14:10.542 --> 14:12.333
But I shouldn't take it out on my friends.

14:13.875 --> 14:17.291
Or become some crazy English chef
who spits all over people.

14:17.625 --> 14:18.792
I'm sorry.

14:19.834 --> 14:21.542
Milton, you can figure this out.

14:21.875 --> 14:24.417
I mean, you rock
in all your other subjects,

14:24.500 --> 14:26.667
history, geometry, chemistry.

14:26.750 --> 14:28.458
You even take honors lunch.

14:29.542 --> 14:32.125
That's it... chemistry!

14:33.291 --> 14:36.792
I just have to look at baking.
As a series of chemical reactions.

15:24.625 --> 15:26.709
It's alive!

15:26.792 --> 15:28.875
It's alive!

15:29.792 --> 15:31.333
With flavor.

15:34.834 --> 15:37.000
I can't believe you're the drowsies.

15:37.458 --> 15:40.917
Don't be afraid, Jack.
I'll try not to overshadow you.

15:41.250 --> 15:44.333
Kind of hard to be afraid
of someone wearing a cloud tutu.

15:45.375 --> 15:48.166
It's called wardrobe, and I look amazing.

15:48.959 --> 15:51.083
Wait, are you wearing makeup?

15:51.166 --> 15:54.625
Yeah, I'm the star of the commercial.
Of course I'm wearing makeup.

15:54.709 --> 15:56.041
I didn't get any makeup.

15:56.125 --> 15:58.417
All right, let's do this. Bring 'em up.

16:00.291 --> 16:01.625
I want makeup!

16:06.125 --> 16:08.625
Thanks for coming in
on a Saturday, Mr. Pedesta.

16:08.709 --> 16:12.250
I'll have you know I'm not happy
about being late for my spin class.

16:12.375 --> 16:13.583
Let's do this.

16:17.250 --> 16:20.166
Smells delicious.

16:20.250 --> 16:21.959
Let's take a closer look.

16:22.458 --> 16:24.208
There are a lot of chemicals in there,
Milton.

16:24.375 --> 16:26.625
- Are you sure it's safe?
- One hundred percent.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.917
The phosphorus atoms draw negative ions,

16:30.291 --> 16:32.709
and the sucrose atoms are all positive.

16:33.083 --> 16:36.583
So everything's fine as long as
the cake doesn't come in contact

16:36.667 --> 16:38.000
with any precious metal.

16:39.792 --> 16:43.000
Uh, like say golden fork?

16:46.583 --> 16:49.542
Nooooo!

17:03.417 --> 17:05.625
So, what do you think?

17:07.041 --> 17:08.500
Pretty moist, huh?

17:11.542 --> 17:13.250
<i>♪ Kickin' it with you! ♪</i>

17:14.083 --> 17:16.917

17:22.500 --> 17:23.709

Cut, cut, cut!

17:30.834 --> 17:33.542
Who was that? Ring-ring. Who is it?

17:33.625 --> 17:35.667
Oh, it's Jack phoning it in.

17:36.375 --> 17:40.250
Okay, nobody directs anybody
on this set but me.

17:40.375 --> 17:43.750
You're right, T-bone. Jump on in here.
Try to get a performance out of him,

17:43.834 --> 17:45.250
'cause he's giving me nothing.

17:46.125 --> 17:49.083
Back to one, everybody.

17:49.166 --> 17:50.667
Back to one, everybody!

17:53.792 --> 17:56.333
And action.

17:56.417 --> 17:59.458
Wake up, tired people.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.875
I am Pomegranate Man,

18:00.959 --> 18:03.834
here to bring Pomegranate Pow
to the entire city.

18:03.875 --> 18:06.500
- Cue music!
-

18:06.583 --> 18:08.542
And battle scene.

18:13.875 --> 18:17.583
And Pomegranate Pow!

18:22.834 --> 18:26.000
Get Pomegranate Pow
and say goodbye to the drowsies.

18:31.166 --> 18:33.333
What are you doing?
You're not supposed to come back.

18:33.417 --> 18:37.041
Well, maybe getting rid of the drowsies
isn't as easy as you thought,

18:37.125 --> 18:38.417
Pomegranate Man.

18:41.542 --> 18:43.458
That's uh... that's not in the script.

18:51.959 --> 18:53.834
Yah!

19:10.625 --> 19:12.875
Jack, you saved me.

19:12.959 --> 19:14.959
Of course. I'd never let you fall.

19:15.041 --> 19:18.583
Guys, Jack's cable isn't strong enough
to hold the both of you.

19:19.000 --> 19:20.917
Jack, let Rudy go.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.125
You've got more good earning
years ahead of you.

19:23.709 --> 19:25.583
Jack, let me go.

19:26.166 --> 19:29.041
- It's the only way you can save yourself.
- I'm not gonna do that.

19:29.375 --> 19:31.166
It's okay. I've lived.

19:31.625 --> 19:34.542
I've seen things... things like Canada.

19:34.792 --> 19:36.959
And a cow with a birthmark
shaped like another cow.

19:38.166 --> 19:40.041
Forget it, Rudy, I'm not letting go.

19:40.125 --> 19:41.917
Jack, I insist you let me go.

19:42.208 --> 19:44.458
- Okay, if that's how you want it.
- What?

19:47.959 --> 19:52.000
Jack, Jack, I'm sorry. I was being a jerk.

19:52.083 --> 19:54.041
Dude, you saved my life.

19:54.125 --> 19:56.542
You know I only did this commercial
'cause you said I couldn't.

19:56.625 --> 19:58.208
I had no right to do that.

19:58.291 --> 20:00.458
And now that I've had a taste
of this acting thing,

20:00.542 --> 20:01.792
I think I'm through with it.

20:02.583 --> 20:04.542
Yeah, it's not as glamorous as it seems.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.875
Between you and me,
I'm sporting a major harness wedgie.

20:10.125 --> 20:11.583
Look what you two have done.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.583
Oh, you've ruined my commercial!

20:15.000 --> 20:16.542
You're fired!

20:19.583 --> 20:22.041
Putting the whole
little disaster thing aside,

20:22.125 --> 20:23.750
what did you think of my acting chops?

20:23.834 --> 20:26.000
- 'Cause I could go a different way.

Huh, you asked the right guy.

21:08.917 --> 21:11.834
Okay, see, what you do
is you take a mannequin, right?

21:11.917 --> 21:14.375
You put her in a shopping cart
and you roll her down to the beach.

21:14.458 --> 21:16.041
Then you tape a piece of bologna
to her head

21:16.125 --> 21:18.125
and watch the seagulls
dive-bomb her skull.
