They're going to try
to keep her alive after all.

02:48.625 --> 02:49.750
Markos?

03:30.500 --> 03:32.750
I have to tell Sara
to get out of there.

03:35.708 --> 03:38.083
She's the only girl
I actually give a damn about.

03:43.416 --> 03:44.559
If I leave without her,

03:44.583 --> 03:46.833
they may pick her next.

03:47.000 --> 03:48.333
Or Olga.

figured out things.

03:55.208 --> 03:57.750

since the war.

04:21.541 --> 04:24.416
And you think
they can hear you now?

04:43.291 --> 04:45.875
At the beginning,
they gave me things.

04:46.041 --> 04:49.708
Perfect balance, perfect sleep.

04:49.875 --> 04:52.416
Talking with our minds.

Nah?

12:24.791 --> 12:27.458
I tried to call you
at your hotel this morning

12:27.625 --> 12:31.208
to ask you
if you could reschedule.

12:31.375 --> 12:34.125
- Why?
- Company business.

12:34.291 --> 12:36.458
It's not a good time
just today.

12:36.625 --> 12:38.166
But here you are.

13:11.000 --> 13:14.166
And one, and two,

13:14.333 --> 13:17.833
and three, and four,

13:18.000 --> 13:19.750
and five,

13:19.916 --> 13:23.583
and six, and seven,

13:23.750 --> 13:24.875
and eight.

13:25.041 --> 13:27.333
Elbows up. And one...

13:28.708 --> 13:30.000
Come in, Susie.

13:33.583 --> 13:38.000
Miss Millius and Miss Mandel
are the company's repetiteurs.

13:38.166 --> 13:40.083
And Veva Blanc?

13:40.250 --> 13:42.250
I was told she would be here.

13:42.416 --> 13:43.791
Oh, dear.

13:43.958 --> 13:47.250
You have no formal training
or references.

13:47.416 --> 13:49.500
Your insistence to audition

13:49.666 --> 13:54.166
happened to catch Madame Blanc
on a good day.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.916
But you really shouldn't
be here at all.

13:58.083 --> 14:00.500
Do you understand?

14:00.666 --> 14:02.333
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

14:02.500 --> 14:03.500
Good.

14:14.583 --> 14:16.791
Uh...

14:16.958 --> 14:19.958
I prefer dancing without music.

14:20.125 --> 14:21.750
Danke schoen.

14:21.916 --> 14:24.083
You can keep time
in your head, yes?

15:02.416 --> 15:04.791
Mm-hmm, and Hypnose.

15:04.958 --> 15:07.000
And here we have...

15:07.166 --> 15:08.666
a line between the elbows.

15:08.833 --> 15:10.000
Face forward.

15:10.166 --> 15:13.250
Perfect, and... Morphus.

15:13.416 --> 15:16.041
And here,
not so close to the face.

15:16.208 --> 15:18.333
More like you're holding
a bird or something.

16:15.500 --> 16:17.875
They did it when we
were in morning rehearsal.

16:18.041 --> 16:20.125
They just put her things
in shipping boxes.

16:20.291 --> 16:22.666
You don't think she
had to go underground, do you?

16:22.833 --> 16:24.458
I don't care what happened.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.166
I just want her to call.

16:26.333 --> 16:27.500
I'm really worried.

16:30.458 --> 16:31.875
Fraulein Bannion.

16:32.041 --> 16:33.208
Kommen Sie.

16:38.791 --> 16:41.041
I've just spoken
with Madame Blanc.

16:41.208 --> 16:42.625
Well done, Miss Bannion.

16:47.041 --> 16:49.583
I imagine you will need
to return home

16:49.750 --> 16:52.125
to settle things
and make arrangements

16:52.291 --> 16:53.041
for moving to Berlin.

16:53.208 --> 16:54.375
No. No, no.

16:54.541 --> 16:57.000
I can start right now.

16:57.166 --> 16:59.916
Good.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.750
This is Miss Boutaher,

17:02.916 --> 17:04.875
our technical director.

17:05.040 --> 17:06.583
Guten Tag.

17:06.750 --> 17:09.125
And this is Miss Vendegast.

17:09.290 --> 17:11.165
- She acts as house mother...
- Hello.

17:11.333 --> 17:13.833
...for our dancers
who reside here.

17:16.583 --> 17:17.583
Where'd you come from?

17:19.000 --> 17:21.833
Ohio.

17:26.083 --> 17:28.540
We operate as a sort
of Ruth Bré collective.

17:28.708 --> 17:31.500
As we cannot pay our dancers
a lot of money,

17:31.666 --> 17:34.791
we offer dormitory-style rooms,
rent-free.

17:34.958 --> 17:37.583
You don't... you don't charge
anything at all?

17:37.750 --> 17:39.000
Not a mark.

17:43.208 --> 17:45.166
In this company,
we fully understand

17:45.333 --> 17:49.708
the importance of a woman's
financial autonomy.

17:51.541 --> 17:54.333
Normally, it would be full
at this time of year,

17:54.500 --> 17:57.041
but we have had a room open.

17:57.208 --> 17:58.750
Yeah. Patricia's.

17:59.708 --> 18:01.916
Do you know Patricia?

18:02.083 --> 18:03.166
Mmm...

18:04.958 --> 18:06.708
No, I heard some girls talking

18:06.875 --> 18:08.291
about her in the hall.

18:08.458 --> 18:11.166
Ah.

18:11.333 --> 18:15.458
Now that you're one of us,
I won't be coy.

18:15.625 --> 18:17.500
Patricia has just left
the company

18:17.666 --> 18:20.208
under sad circumstances.

18:20.375 --> 18:23.833
We think she won't be back,
so there's room if you want.

18:24.000 --> 18:28.625
We'll send you one of our girls
to help you with your luggage.

18:28.791 --> 18:30.416
After lunch.

18:30.583 --> 18:32.208
It's all right for you?

18:32.375 --> 18:33.791
Yes.

18:33.958 --> 18:35.000
It's-it... it's all...

18:35.166 --> 18:36.791
Yes.

18:36.958 --> 18:38.375
It's perfect.

19:04.541 --> 19:06.583
Hello. Hi.
I'm sorry I'm late.

19:06.750 --> 19:08.250
- Hi.
- It's the rain.

19:08.416 --> 19:10.267
Whenever it rains in Berlin,
everyone jumps in a cab,

19:10.291 --> 19:12.000
and like an idiot,
I just let ours go.

19:12.166 --> 19:13.625
Hi. I'm Sara.

19:13.791 --> 19:15.642
We're gonna have to take
our chances on the street.

19:15.666 --> 19:17.333
Do you have an umbrella?

19:17.500 --> 19:19.375
Oh, when you weren't here
by 6:00,

19:19.541 --> 19:22.750
I had to take the room
for another night.

19:22.916 --> 19:24.333
Oh. God, Susie, I'm sorry.

19:24.500 --> 19:26.291
Everything was a mess
at the company today.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.708
Why are you smiling?

19:28.875 --> 19:30.708
I'm sor... I-I...

19:30.875 --> 19:33.583
Um, uh, when you said Berlin
a second ago,

19:33.750 --> 19:35.250
you said "everyone in Berlin,"

19:35.416 --> 19:39.000
and I just thought that...
that includes me now.

19:39.166 --> 19:40.625
I live in Berlin.

19:40.791 --> 19:42.958
Yes. Congrats.

19:43.125 --> 19:45.416
I heard you were
a sensation today.

19:45.583 --> 19:47.383
Have you called your
family yet, to tell them?

19:49.208 --> 19:51.166
Miss Blanc came
into my audition.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.208
But she left right after.

19:54.375 --> 19:56.666
She's incredible.

19:56.833 --> 20:00.166
The way she transmits her work,
her energy.

20:00.333 --> 20:01.434
When it shines on you, it's...

20:01.458 --> 20:03.208
"addictive" is the word for it.

20:03.375 --> 20:04.708
She's tough.

20:04.875 --> 20:07.083
She kept the company alive
through the war.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.309
When the Reich just wanted
women to shut off their minds

20:09.333 --> 20:11.583
and keep their uteruses open,

20:11.750 --> 20:13.625
there was Blanc.

20:13.791 --> 20:14.833
Thank you.

20:15.000 --> 20:17.291
La vraie chose.

20:17.458 --> 20:18.166
What?

20:18.333 --> 20:19.333
W-Was that French?

20:30.041 --> 20:31.583
It's a bomb.

20:31.750 --> 20:33.708
I can smell it.

20:33.875 --> 20:35.083
There's a bank that way.

20:37.416 --> 20:39.958
Don't you know
what's happening here?

20:40.125 --> 20:41.666
The hijackers
are negotiating a release

20:41.833 --> 20:44.083
of the Stammheim prisoners
tonight.

20:44.250 --> 20:45.958
The RAF.

20:46.125 --> 20:48.416
Baader-Meinhof.

20:48.583 --> 20:50.583
They kidnapped an executive.

20:50.750 --> 20:54.666
During the war,
he was a Nazi SS, an officer.

20:54.833 --> 20:59.041
Now he runs the German
Employers' Association.

20:59.208 --> 21:00.768
You don't get how awful
that is, do you?

21:07.958 --> 21:09.541
Sorry.

21:09.708 --> 21:12.375
I'm just worried
about my friend.

27:34.333 --> 27:35.958
Bedrooms are on
the second floor.

27:54.083 --> 27:57.125
Why don't you try speaking
to me like you love me?

27:57.291 --> 27:58.583
Huh?

27:58.750 --> 28:00.375
For a change.

28:03.416 --> 28:05.333
This is my room.

28:05.500 --> 28:08.000
And here...

28:08.166 --> 28:09.416
is yours.

28:09.583 --> 28:12.833
We're neighbors.

28:13.000 --> 28:15.458
You can knock on the wall
if you ever need anything.

29:42.750 --> 29:43.916
Good morning.

29:44.083 --> 29:45.875
- Good morning.
- Hello.

29:47.250 --> 29:48.791
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

29:48.958 --> 29:51.708
- Hi.
- Good morning. Good morning.

29:51.875 --> 29:53.541
How's your knee? Okay?

29:55.000 --> 29:56.541
It's wonderful you're here.

29:56.708 --> 29:58.833
Thank you.

30:05.083 --> 30:08.625
We have some happier
company business today.

30:08.791 --> 30:10.750
We have a new dancer.

30:10.916 --> 30:14.500
This is Susie Bannion,
who's joining us from America.

30:14.666 --> 30:17.375
I was privileged to witness
her audition yesterday.

30:17.541 --> 30:19.833
We are very lucky to have her.

30:20.000 --> 30:21.875
Would you like
to say something, Susie?

30:24.166 --> 30:25.625
Um...

30:25.791 --> 30:28.166
I don't know.

30:28.333 --> 30:29.333
Hello.

30:32.000 --> 30:33.458
I feel like
I'm not even here yet.

30:33.625 --> 30:34.791
I don't know.

30:34.958 --> 30:36.142
You join in
whenever you feel ready,

30:36.166 --> 30:37.833
but there's no rush.

30:38.000 --> 30:41.166
Welcome to our little family.

30:41.333 --> 30:42.416
I'm Susie.

30:42.583 --> 30:44.666
Hi. Hi.

30:44.833 --> 30:47.125
All right,
so for today's rehearsal,

30:47.291 --> 30:50.125
I want to pick up exactly
where we left off with Volk.

30:50.291 --> 30:51.458
I've spoken to Olga,

30:51.625 --> 30:54.375
and she's going to dance
Patricia's part.

30:54.541 --> 30:59.250
And, Sara, I'd like you
to dance Olga's part.

30:59.416 --> 31:00.666
Is everyone happy with that?

31:00.833 --> 31:03.458
Okay.

31:03.625 --> 31:04.833
Good.

31:16.958 --> 31:18.958
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Music off, please.

31:19.125 --> 31:20.916
One moment.

31:21.083 --> 31:22.250
Okay, so...

31:22.416 --> 31:25.500
And one, and two, and three.

31:25.666 --> 31:27.125
You pull it from the ground.

31:27.291 --> 31:28.958
All right? Gravity, remember.

31:29.125 --> 31:31.125
And everybody from here,
please.

31:31.291 --> 31:32.583
And Tanner.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.708
One and two and three.

31:34.875 --> 31:36.916
And one, and two, and three.

31:37.083 --> 31:39.250
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.

31:39.416 --> 31:41.875
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.

31:42.041 --> 31:43.958
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.

31:44.125 --> 31:46.291
Und eins,
und zwei, und drei.

31:46.458 --> 31:48.291
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.

31:48.458 --> 31:50.333
Und eins,
und zwei, und drei.

31:50.500 --> 31:52.750
Und eins, und zwei, und drei.

31:52.916 --> 31:54.500
This is shit.

31:56.458 --> 31:58.166
- Such shit.
- Okay.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.375
Why don't we all break
for ten minutes.

32:01.541 --> 32:04.625
You can't even be bothered
to respect your own lies.

32:04.791 --> 32:06.458
Miss Ivanova!

32:06.625 --> 32:08.541
No, no, no, no, no, it's okay.

32:08.708 --> 32:10.166
Let's face this.

32:11.541 --> 32:14.083
Patricia is gone, Olga.

32:14.250 --> 32:16.333
We don't know where.

32:16.500 --> 32:18.434
If she's gone into hiding,
she wouldn't have told us,

32:18.458 --> 32:20.708
- would she?
- She would have told someone.

32:20.875 --> 32:22.375
We know that she had dealings

32:22.541 --> 32:24.875
with people
who are interested in targets.

32:25.041 --> 32:26.361
And we know
there was another bomb

32:26.458 --> 32:27.583
in Kreuzberg last night.

32:27.750 --> 32:28.790
She wouldn't do that.

32:30.000 --> 32:31.958
She wanted to live her beliefs.

32:32.125 --> 32:34.333
Who doesn't admire that?

32:34.500 --> 32:38.041
And there's so much to change
in the world.

32:38.208 --> 32:39.833
If she wants to live
in a cellar

32:40.000 --> 32:42.916
filling bottles with petrol,
that's her choice.

32:43.083 --> 32:46.125
And who won't be heartbroken
if she's shot by police?

32:46.291 --> 32:49.166
You manipulate everything.

32:51.416 --> 32:54.500
She didn't trust you
because you're hypocrites.

32:54.666 --> 32:57.208
Will you take Olga
to her room, please, Tanner?

32:58.625 --> 33:00.375
No, Miss Tanner!

33:01.750 --> 33:03.416
Call Olga a cab.

33:03.583 --> 33:05.541
She's had enough.

33:05.708 --> 33:07.208
And is going to pack her things

33:07.375 --> 33:10.958
and get the fuck out
from this box of rabies!

33:27.916 --> 33:30.375
I'm sorry about that.

33:32.250 --> 33:33.916
It's a hot thing we do.

33:39.208 --> 33:43.500
Okay, so... who will dance
the protagonist?

33:43.666 --> 33:45.333
Sonia?

33:45.500 --> 33:48.125
I can't. Not yet.

33:48.291 --> 33:49.750
Caroline?

33:53.750 --> 33:56.000
Very well. We'll manage.

33:56.166 --> 33:59.375
I suggest that we all
take it from the top.

33:59.541 --> 34:01.083
I'll dance.

34:10.666 --> 34:12.125
I know it.

34:12.291 --> 34:13.750
It's in the documentary.

34:13.916 --> 34:15.875
I-I've seen it a hundred times
at the library.

34:18.875 --> 34:21.416
Sweetheart,
we rehearsed this piece

34:21.583 --> 34:24.333
for ten months
before we performed it.

34:25.750 --> 34:28.541
I've seen it in person, too.

34:28.708 --> 34:31.250
First do it alone, then.

34:31.416 --> 34:34.958
We don't want to put
the others at risk.

34:35.125 --> 34:36.833
The last thing we need

34:37.000 --> 34:40.625
is someone to get kicked
in the ribs.

34:44.708 --> 34:46.333
All right?

35:43.583 --> 35:44.750
Okay, stop. Stop, stop.

35:44.916 --> 35:46.458
Stop.

35:46.625 --> 35:48.083
All right.

35:48.250 --> 35:49.875
Clear your head.

35:50.041 --> 35:51.916
I want you to start over.

35:52.083 --> 35:54.375
Have you stretched?

35:54.541 --> 35:56.416
This is no joke.

36:27.000 --> 36:28.958
Olga.

37:33.458 --> 37:35.000
Olga.

37:39.333 --> 37:41.583
Come.

38:09.708 --> 38:12.166
Remember, you start
on one with the music,

38:12.333 --> 38:15.458
and if you feel ill
at any time, just stop.

38:15.625 --> 38:17.583
You start here.

38:17.750 --> 38:18.875
And...

39:20.041 --> 39:21.625
Lauter!

39:29.375 --> 39:31.666
Bravo. Bravo, Susie.

41:44.125 --> 41:45.583
It'll pass.

41:45.750 --> 41:48.500
You're not the first dancer
who lost the room.

41:53.333 --> 41:55.041
I'm not usually dizzy.

41:55.208 --> 41:56.458
An occasional collapse

41:56.625 --> 41:59.083
is a vocational hazard,
I'm afraid.

41:59.250 --> 42:02.625
I-I didn't...
I didn't collapse.

42:02.791 --> 42:05.875
You're on the floor, and that's
not where the dance ends.

42:08.916 --> 42:11.500
I was trying not to throw up
in your studio.

42:11.666 --> 42:13.041
Susie, it's fine.

42:13.208 --> 42:15.375
It was wonderful.

42:15.541 --> 42:18.708
Sara, can you take her
to her room, please?

42:18.875 --> 42:21.250
You can rest
for the rest of the day.

42:33.625 --> 42:36.166
- How enlightening.
- Okay, come on, girls.

42:36.333 --> 42:37.875
Let's go.

42:38.041 --> 42:40.416
And one, and two, and three.

42:40.583 --> 42:41.916
And...

43:32.791 --> 43:33.583
No, Susie.

43:33.750 --> 43:37.375
We have to study America.

43:37.541 --> 43:39.208
I said no.

43:42.041 --> 43:43.416
Susanna.

47:46.666 --> 47:48.375
You don't look better.

47:48.541 --> 47:50.916
Or are you this pale
all the time?

47:52.250 --> 47:53.916
I will leave you.

47:55.375 --> 47:56.541
Good night.

48:06.208 --> 48:07.708
The Amish split

48:07.875 --> 48:10.208
from the Mennonites
in the 17th century.

48:10.375 --> 48:11.517
They were worried
the Mennonites

48:11.541 --> 48:13.125
were becoming too liberal.

48:14.375 --> 48:16.541
"They"? Not "we"?

48:16.708 --> 48:20.083
You've left religious thinking
behind you, then?

48:20.250 --> 48:22.583
And you're not comfortable
talking about these things.

48:22.750 --> 48:24.916
I don't know why we are.

48:25.083 --> 48:26.763
It's difficult not
to be curious about you.

48:26.875 --> 48:29.208
In two days, you've auditioned,

48:29.375 --> 48:32.875
been accepted
and danced a lead.

48:33.041 --> 48:35.791
How did your journey
towards us begin?

48:35.958 --> 48:37.500
I went to New York.

48:37.666 --> 48:39.916
To the Martha Graham Center.

48:40.083 --> 48:42.750
I saw you there three times.

48:42.916 --> 48:44.500
I went once by bus,

48:44.666 --> 48:47.125
then I hitchhiked
the other two.

48:47.291 --> 48:49.875
That's risky.

48:50.041 --> 48:52.083
Were you punished?

48:53.041 --> 48:54.625
Yeah.

48:55.625 --> 48:58.041
But I felt I had to see you.

49:06.875 --> 49:09.125
What did it feel today

49:09.291 --> 49:13.208
to dance Volkin front
of the one who made it?

49:13.375 --> 49:15.250
No, no.
That's a vain question.

49:15.416 --> 49:17.500
Let me ask you another.

49:17.666 --> 49:21.750
When you were dancing,
what did it feel like...

49:21.916 --> 49:25.416
inside you, inside your body?

49:30.916 --> 49:35.750
It felt like what I think
it must feel like to fuck.

49:35.916 --> 49:37.833
You mean to fuck a man?

49:38.000 --> 49:40.041
No, I...

49:40.208 --> 49:41.750
was thinking of an animal.

49:50.208 --> 49:52.000
You looked...

50:03.041 --> 50:06.666
I'm going to ask Caroline
to work on your jumps with you.

50:06.833 --> 50:09.375
Yours are nowhere near
good enough yet.

50:09.541 --> 50:11.291
We'll have to build you up.

50:12.958 --> 50:14.875
So that I can dance
the protagonist

50:15.041 --> 50:16.833
when you perform it?

50:17.000 --> 50:20.500
I'll need to see you dance at
this level time and time again.

50:20.666 --> 50:21.833
I can do it.

50:27.875 --> 50:31.875
Olga made Volkseem
like such heavy lifting.

50:33.583 --> 50:35.103
She never understood
the heart of Volk.

50:37.541 --> 50:39.500
She lacked conviction.

50:39.666 --> 50:41.541
I'm relieved she's gone.

50:43.416 --> 50:46.375
Thank you for your help
with that.

50:53.000 --> 50:55.291
Madame Blanc...

50:55.458 --> 51:00.333
wants me to dance
the protagonist in Volk.

51:02.833 --> 51:06.416
I didn't think it was
gonna be like this.

51:06.583 --> 51:09.500
She's so kind.

51:09.666 --> 51:11.291
That's wonderful.

51:15.291 --> 51:16.750
Are you all right?

51:18.666 --> 51:21.583
I'm fine. I was just...

51:24.083 --> 51:27.666
I was just thinking about
what Olga said in rehearsal.

51:27.833 --> 51:29.416
About Patricia.

51:29.583 --> 51:31.791
What do you mean?

51:31.958 --> 51:35.541
She was active
in some political groups.

51:37.958 --> 51:40.000
No one knows where she is,
really.

51:40.166 --> 51:42.500
If she's all right.

51:42.666 --> 51:45.125
Was it true...

51:45.291 --> 51:46.833
what Olga said?

51:48.916 --> 51:51.208
Yes.

51:51.375 --> 51:53.916
Patricia didn't trust
the matrons.

51:55.416 --> 51:57.666
And I never understood why.

52:01.916 --> 52:04.750
If I asked you for a favor
tomorrow, would you do it?

52:04.916 --> 52:05.958
Yes.

52:13.291 --> 52:15.791
We might get caught.

52:16.833 --> 52:17.875
Okay.

53:04.666 --> 53:06.208
Mother. Mother.

53:06.875 --> 53:08.166
Mother.

53:08.333 --> 53:11.333
Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother.

53:11.500 --> 53:13.125
Mother. Mother.

53:17.041 --> 53:18.121
Susanna.

54:56.833 --> 54:58.375
- Guten Morgen.
- Guten Morgen.

54:58.541 --> 54:59.541
Morgen.

54:59.708 --> 55:01.250
Guten Morgen.

55:11.708 --> 55:13.416
Yeah, I know. It's crazy.

55:13.583 --> 55:15.500
Okay, well, let's meet soon.

55:23.250 --> 55:24.750
Yeah, no, I'm-I'm... I'm ready.

55:24.916 --> 55:26.916
I'm almost out the door.

55:27.083 --> 55:28.791
Okay. Yeah.

55:28.958 --> 55:31.458
- I'll see you soon.
- Marketa.

55:32.833 --> 55:36.166
- Marketa, come on.
- I'll see you soon.

55:38.166 --> 55:39.625
Come on.

55:57.791 --> 55:59.291
Come, come, come.

56:10.291 --> 56:13.125
Are you sure no one's coming?

56:13.291 --> 56:15.250
Oh, I'm sure. Don't worry.

56:15.416 --> 56:17.541
Nobody comes here
during the weekend.

56:46.083 --> 56:47.458
Patricia's isn't here.

56:47.625 --> 56:49.958
Try looking for Olga's.

56:50.125 --> 56:51.625
Olga...

56:52.458 --> 56:53.875
She's not here.

56:55.708 --> 56:58.000
I just need a number.

56:58.166 --> 57:00.375
For her parents or someone
who can tell me for sure

57:00.541 --> 57:01.791
she is or isn't in Berlin.

57:23.041 --> 57:25.333
Hmm. How odd.

57:30.333 --> 57:31.625
1961.

57:33.541 --> 57:35.000
1955.

57:36.916 --> 57:38.625
1949.

57:40.208 --> 57:41.500
It's bizarre.

57:47.250 --> 57:49.170
Here, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

58:18.166 --> 58:21.041
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty,
kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty...

58:35.875 --> 58:37.041
There's nothing.

58:37.208 --> 58:38.625
Come on.

58:42.833 --> 58:45.125
Sit down.

58:49.750 --> 58:51.583
This morning,

58:51.750 --> 58:54.541
we turn our instincts inward.

58:54.708 --> 58:56.083
Miss Millius, Miss Mandel,

58:56.250 --> 58:58.083
can you close the mirrors,
please?

58:58.250 --> 58:59.375
Miss Marks, no music.

59:08.291 --> 59:11.083
I want to start work
on a new piece.

59:11.250 --> 59:15.375
A piece about rebirths.

59:15.541 --> 59:18.500
The inevitable pull
that they exert

59:18.666 --> 59:22.458
and our efforts to escape them.

59:22.625 --> 59:25.291
We'll learn it now, but, Susie,

59:25.458 --> 59:28.291
you will improvise freely
at its heart.

59:28.458 --> 59:30.333
I'm interested
in your instincts here.

59:40.750 --> 59:44.083
The piece will be called
Weider OÖffnen.

59:44.250 --> 59:46.041
Open Again.

59:46.208 --> 59:47.625
Allez.

59:54.333 --> 59:57.916
One, two, three, four.

59:58.083 --> 01:00:01.666
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:01.833 --> 01:00:05.333
One, two, three, four.

01:00:05.500 --> 01:00:09.250
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:09.416 --> 01:00:12.916
One, two, three, four.

01:00:13.083 --> 01:00:15.583
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:16.791 --> 01:00:20.208
One, two, three, four.

01:00:20.375 --> 01:00:23.791
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:23.958 --> 01:00:27.500
One, two, three, four.

01:00:27.666 --> 01:00:28.791
One...

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.041
...two, three, four.

01:00:31.208 --> 01:00:34.958
One, two, three, four.

01:00:35.125 --> 01:00:38.125
One, two, three, four.

01:00:38.291 --> 01:00:42.083
One, two, three, four.

01:00:42.250 --> 01:00:45.791
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:45.958 --> 01:00:49.583
One, two, three, four.

01:00:49.750 --> 01:00:53.083
One, two,
three, four.

01:00:53.250 --> 01:00:56.583
One, two, three, four.

01:00:56.750 --> 01:00:58.375
One...

01:02:41.791 --> 01:02:43.666
Did something happen?

01:02:43.833 --> 01:02:45.958
- Hmm?
- To you, during it?

01:02:48.250 --> 01:02:50.333
N-No.

01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:52.083
Did you... did you...

01:02:53.208 --> 01:02:56.000
Did you feel something there?

01:02:57.958 --> 01:03:00.208
Someone?

01:03:00.375 --> 01:03:02.000
Or just something.

01:03:03.833 --> 01:03:05.166
What made you say that?

01:03:05.333 --> 01:03:06.583
I don't know.

01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:12.333
Am I confusing you?

01:03:13.333 --> 01:03:15.125
No, it's, um...

01:03:16.333 --> 01:03:18.791
It's odd. It's the...

01:03:18.958 --> 01:03:20.666
It's the sort of thing
Patricia would say.

01:03:20.833 --> 01:03:23.416
It's bizarre.

01:03:23.583 --> 01:03:25.125
Come on.

01:03:25.291 --> 01:03:27.251
Let's get changed,
or Sonia will leave without us.

01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:28.616
I've got a dress you can wear.

01:03:28.666 --> 01:03:29.916
Double caposhi.

01:03:40.041 --> 01:03:42.041
♪ ♪

01:03:45.708 --> 01:03:47.208
Susie!

01:03:58.791 --> 01:04:00.541
Oh, Susie!

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:51.541
Is it true?

01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.041
Is it true?

01:06:32.916 --> 01:06:34.750
I know who I am!

01:06:36.291 --> 01:06:38.333
I know who I am!

01:06:43.416 --> 01:06:46.125
It's all right.

01:06:46.291 --> 01:06:47.333
It's okay.

01:06:47.500 --> 01:06:49.083
Is she all right?

01:06:49.250 --> 01:06:50.708
It's just a nightmare.

01:06:50.875 --> 01:06:52.500
The Markos Company special.

01:06:52.666 --> 01:06:54.583
I'm surprised
it took this long.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:56.916
Hey, let me know
if she needs a Valium.

01:07:05.208 --> 01:07:07.458
She's right. I dreamt
of hairballs in toilets

01:07:07.625 --> 01:07:10.541
for three weeks before I got
a decent night of sleep here.

01:07:12.416 --> 01:07:13.500
Move over.

01:07:25.166 --> 01:07:28.625
I've only ever slept
in bed with my sister.

01:07:28.791 --> 01:07:30.458
We're sisters now.

01:09:26.625 --> 01:09:28.707
Herr Klemperer?

01:11:43.041 --> 01:11:45.375
And one, and two, and three.

01:11:45.541 --> 01:11:47.750
And one, and two,
and three.

01:11:47.916 --> 01:11:50.291
And one, and two, and three.

01:11:50.458 --> 01:11:53.166
And one, and two,
and three.

01:11:53.333 --> 01:11:55.291
One, and two, and three.

01:11:55.458 --> 01:11:57.958
And one, and two, and three.

01:11:58.125 --> 01:12:00.416
And one, and two,
and three.

01:12:00.583 --> 01:12:02.791
And one, and two, and three.

01:12:02.958 --> 01:12:04.708
That's-that's okay.

01:12:07.041 --> 01:12:08.708
Do you want to do the jumps?

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:12.166
Okay.

01:12:12.333 --> 01:12:14.041
And...

01:12:14.208 --> 01:12:16.500
one, and two, and three.

01:12:16.666 --> 01:12:19.250
And one, and two, and three.

01:12:19.416 --> 01:12:20.166
No.

01:12:20.333 --> 01:12:22.041
Elbows higher.

01:12:22.208 --> 01:12:23.416
All right, one moment.

01:12:23.583 --> 01:12:25.458
Susie, part of the jump
is muscle,

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:27.916
and that will develop
as you condition,

01:12:28.083 --> 01:12:29.642
but you seem to have
an aversion to them,

01:12:29.666 --> 01:12:31.208
and I don't quite see why.

01:12:31.375 --> 01:12:33.083
Are you so happy
to be stuck to the earth?

01:12:34.625 --> 01:12:36.458
There's a yield
before the push,

01:12:36.625 --> 01:12:38.351
which I don't think
you're quite understanding.

01:12:38.375 --> 01:12:41.666
Caroline. Could you come and do
a series for us, please?

01:12:58.041 --> 01:12:59.041
Thank you.

01:13:00.291 --> 01:13:01.666
And now you.

01:13:28.541 --> 01:13:30.666
What I really want
is to be on...

01:13:30.833 --> 01:13:32.916
on the floor right now, anyway.

01:13:33.083 --> 01:13:34.541
Well, of course.

01:13:34.708 --> 01:13:37.041
That's because you're mistaking
physical weakness

01:13:37.208 --> 01:13:39.208
with artistic preference.

01:13:39.375 --> 01:13:41.083
And because you're tired.

01:13:43.166 --> 01:13:45.791
At this point,

01:13:45.958 --> 01:13:48.291
the jumps are opposing
the pull of the structure,

01:13:48.458 --> 01:13:50.750
but...

01:13:50.916 --> 01:13:52.666
it's soon for that,
don't you think?

01:13:54.791 --> 01:13:59.375
The floor work is... is keeping
the other dancers pushed down.

01:13:59.541 --> 01:14:02.125
So this...

01:14:02.291 --> 01:14:05.000
this could echo that...

01:14:09.208 --> 01:14:13.041
...on-on a slightly higher
point of elevation.

01:14:15.750 --> 01:14:17.500
If I stay close
to the ground now

01:14:17.666 --> 01:14:21.416
and go straight into the jumps
where you have them later,

01:14:21.583 --> 01:14:25.750
then that's more to the point.

01:14:25.916 --> 01:14:28.208
The resistance is more...

01:14:28.375 --> 01:14:30.416
emphatic.

01:14:30.583 --> 01:14:31.833
Right?

01:14:35.291 --> 01:14:40.208
I don't know how aware you are

01:14:40.375 --> 01:14:43.750
of what times we lived through
here 40 years ago.

01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:48.375
Out of which
this piece was made.

01:14:50.416 --> 01:14:52.625
We learned at great cost
through those years

01:14:52.791 --> 01:14:56.000
the value of the balance
of things.

01:14:56.166 --> 01:15:01.250
Every arrow that flies
feels the pull of the earth,

01:15:01.416 --> 01:15:05.166
but we must aim upwards.

01:15:05.333 --> 01:15:07.000
We need to get you in the air.

01:15:25.750 --> 01:15:27.790
Leave her, leave her,
leave her, leave her, leave...

01:15:52.791 --> 01:15:54.500
Ja?

01:16:01.208 --> 01:16:03.250
She hit her head hard.

01:16:03.416 --> 01:16:04.875
I heard it. I hope...

01:16:14.041 --> 01:16:18.916
I am... I'm looking for
a dancer from your company.

01:16:19.083 --> 01:16:21.458
Who are you looking for?

01:16:21.625 --> 01:16:23.250
You are Sara.

01:16:26.041 --> 01:16:27.666
Yes.

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:28.833
May I help you?

01:16:29.000 --> 01:16:32.166
I am a friend from Patricia.

01:16:54.250 --> 01:16:56.375
I don't know what
to make of any of this.

01:16:56.541 --> 01:16:58.351
I know the kind of thing
she was involved with,

01:16:58.375 --> 01:16:59.708
but I can't see how any of this

01:16:59.875 --> 01:17:02.041
could be happening
inside the company.

01:17:02.208 --> 01:17:05.708
Well, she describes...

01:17:05.875 --> 01:17:08.833
something like
a revolutionary organization

01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:11.666
in a crisis of leadership.

01:17:11.833 --> 01:17:14.875
With Markos very ill...

01:17:16.541 --> 01:17:18.291
I live there.

01:17:18.458 --> 01:17:19.708
I have friends there.

01:17:19.875 --> 01:17:21.958
I don't see any evidence
of this at all.

01:17:22.125 --> 01:17:23.458
No one has ever approached me

01:17:23.625 --> 01:17:25.375
or any of the other girls,
as far as I know.

01:17:25.541 --> 01:17:28.416
Read this.

01:17:28.583 --> 01:17:29.583
What is this?

01:17:29.708 --> 01:17:31.666
This is Patricia's diary.

01:17:33.750 --> 01:17:35.500
Mother Markos.

01:17:35.666 --> 01:17:38.833
Mother Meinhof.

01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.333
The dance rehearsal.

01:17:40.500 --> 01:17:41.875
Political action.

01:17:42.041 --> 01:17:43.916
These two areas
in Patricia's life

01:17:44.083 --> 01:17:47.291
were of equal importance.

01:17:47.458 --> 01:17:50.166
This is how
transference happens,

01:17:50.333 --> 01:17:53.666
how delusion is made.

01:17:53.833 --> 01:17:55.416
Delusion, Sara,

01:17:55.583 --> 01:17:59.250
is a lie that tells a truth.

01:17:59.416 --> 01:18:01.583
- This says "witches."
- Mmm.

01:18:03.333 --> 01:18:07.916
Maybe Patricia's fantasies
about witches,

01:18:08.083 --> 01:18:13.708
they are her way of processing
some other form of intrigue.

01:18:16.750 --> 01:18:19.250
The company's a family.

01:18:19.416 --> 01:18:21.250
There's a lot of love there.

01:18:21.416 --> 01:18:22.958
Love and manipulation...

01:18:23.125 --> 01:18:27.416
they... they share houses
very often.

01:18:27.583 --> 01:18:30.250
They are frequent bedfellows.

01:18:30.416 --> 01:18:32.250
Sorry, I don't see this.

01:18:36.958 --> 01:18:38.000
Eat.

01:18:40.208 --> 01:18:41.250
Eat.

01:18:50.291 --> 01:18:53.000
Only...

01:18:53.166 --> 01:18:56.041
maybe the police,
they missed something.

01:18:57.333 --> 01:19:01.416
And Patricia,
she did spoke of...

01:19:01.583 --> 01:19:04.791
whole hidden areas
of the building.

01:19:04.958 --> 01:19:08.041
Actual rooms that are secret.

01:19:13.666 --> 01:19:16.083
I don't want
to be disrespectful...

01:19:16.250 --> 01:19:18.625
I don't...
but you're asking me,

01:19:18.791 --> 01:19:20.666
- and I'm telling you...
- Oh, please.

01:19:20.833 --> 01:19:22.041
It's a dance company.

01:19:22.208 --> 01:19:24.166
We're not talking
about anything else.

01:19:24.333 --> 01:19:25.916
Sara.

01:19:26.083 --> 01:19:29.458
Please, only look closer.

01:19:29.625 --> 01:19:30.934
Thank you for caring
for Patricia,

01:19:30.958 --> 01:19:32.666
but I hope
you don't come again.

01:19:55.708 --> 01:19:56.916
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:19:57.083 --> 01:19:58.708
Sara, hurry up.

01:19:58.875 --> 01:20:01.208
I'm tired. I need the bathroom.

01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:06.500
- Good night, Doll.
- Good night.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:18.416
She hasn't come back yet?

01:20:24.291 --> 01:20:26.833
Maybe she's seeing somebody.

01:20:31.791 --> 01:20:33.375
Part of the issue always

01:20:33.541 --> 01:20:35.958
is not being able
to see your body in space.

01:20:36.125 --> 01:20:40.750
One angle in one mirror
or on film is not enough.

01:20:40.916 --> 01:20:42.458
Movement is never mute.

01:20:42.625 --> 01:20:44.125
It is a language.

01:20:44.291 --> 01:20:45.833
It's a series
of energetic shapes...

01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:47.583
...written in the air

01:20:47.750 --> 01:20:50.833
like words forming sentences.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:52.458
Like poems.

01:20:53.750 --> 01:20:55.208
Like prayers.

01:20:58.333 --> 01:20:59.625
Spells?

01:21:01.750 --> 01:21:05.833
When you jump,
it's not the height

01:21:06.000 --> 01:21:08.458
but the space beneath you
that matters.

01:21:08.625 --> 01:21:11.375
Every leap into the air
must be a coup de foudre.

01:21:16.708 --> 01:21:18.416
I don't understand.

01:21:18.583 --> 01:21:21.333
A strike of lightning.

01:21:21.500 --> 01:21:23.666
A bolt of love, in fact.

01:21:26.875 --> 01:21:29.416
That's beautiful.

01:21:29.583 --> 01:21:32.916
There are two things
that dance can never be again:

01:21:33.083 --> 01:21:35.958
beautiful and cheerful.

01:21:36.125 --> 01:21:38.000
Today, we need
to break the nose

01:21:38.166 --> 01:21:40.333
of every beautiful thing.

01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:41.958
And if you're going
to be a dancer,

01:21:42.125 --> 01:21:44.041
you must learn French.

01:22:21.875 --> 01:22:23.791
When you dance
the dance of another,

01:22:23.958 --> 01:22:28.000
you make yourself
in the image of its creator.

01:22:28.166 --> 01:22:29.375
You empty yourself

01:22:29.541 --> 01:22:31.041
so that her work can live
within you.

01:22:31.208 --> 01:22:32.500
Do you understand?

01:22:33.791 --> 01:22:35.916
Yeah.

01:22:36.083 --> 01:22:37.250
You're in a company now.

01:22:37.416 --> 01:22:38.750
You have to find
your right place.

01:22:38.916 --> 01:22:40.333
You have to decide...

01:22:40.500 --> 01:22:43.708
what is it you want to be
for this company?

01:22:43.875 --> 01:22:45.708
Is it the head?

01:22:45.875 --> 01:22:47.583
The spine?

01:22:47.750 --> 01:22:49.750
The sex?

01:22:49.916 --> 01:22:51.125
The heart?

01:22:51.291 --> 01:22:52.500
The hands.

01:22:55.541 --> 01:22:57.500
I want to be
this company's hands.

01:23:02.125 --> 01:23:04.125
Higher.

01:23:04.291 --> 01:23:06.041
Higher. Higher.

01:23:06.208 --> 01:23:08.916
Higher.

01:23:09.083 --> 01:23:11.208
Higher! Higher.

01:23:11.375 --> 01:23:12.791
Higher.

01:23:14.416 --> 01:23:17.708
Higher, higher, higher.

01:23:17.875 --> 01:23:19.000
Higher.

01:23:24.500 --> 01:23:25.500
Higher.

01:23:26.166 --> 01:23:28.500
Higher. Higher.

01:23:28.666 --> 01:23:32.416
Higher. Higher. Higher.

01:23:38.541 --> 01:23:41.375
Sometimes I only need
to be told twice.

01:25:40.750 --> 01:25:45.375
33, 34, 35, 36,

01:25:45.541 --> 01:25:48.833
37, 38, 39,

01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:50.583
40, 41.

01:25:55.875 --> 01:25:58.000
57, 58, 59,

01:25:58.166 --> 01:26:00.916
60, 61, 62, 63.

01:26:10.833 --> 01:26:14.000
65, 64, 63, 62.

01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.208
23, 22, 21.

01:26:39.333 --> 01:26:40.833
Ten, nine, eight,

01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:42.625
seven, six.

01:26:42.791 --> 01:26:45.041
Two, one.

01:29:41.833 --> 01:29:44.416
Come with me! Quickly!

01:30:02.500 --> 01:30:05.291
Patricia wrote about

01:30:05.458 --> 01:30:08.875
"Three Mothers" lost in time,

01:30:09.041 --> 01:30:13.416
predating all Christian
invention.

01:30:13.583 --> 01:30:16.916
Pre-God. Pre-Devil.

01:30:17.083 --> 01:30:21.166
Mother Tenebrarum,
Mother Lachrymarum

01:30:21.333 --> 01:30:23.833
and Mother Suspiriorum.

01:30:25.291 --> 01:30:29.500
Darkness, Tears and Sighs.

01:30:30.583 --> 01:30:32.833
I saw images of that
last night.

01:30:33.000 --> 01:30:35.458
In porcelain,
these very fine things.

01:30:35.625 --> 01:30:37.041
You can tell they have money.

01:30:41.208 --> 01:30:44.333
Patricia said that, uh, Markos

01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.875
claims to be one of the Three.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.750
But there is dissent
amongst them.

01:30:49.916 --> 01:30:54.958
She wrote about "Markosites"
and "Blancites."

01:30:55.125 --> 01:30:58.416
In-Internal division.

01:30:58.583 --> 01:31:00.666
Madame Blanc's
involved in this?

01:31:07.250 --> 01:31:10.625
Do they believe
they're witches?

01:31:10.791 --> 01:31:16.250
You can give someone
your delusion, Sara.

01:31:16.416 --> 01:31:17.708
That's religion.

01:31:20.541 --> 01:31:22.041
That was the Reich.

01:31:23.666 --> 01:31:25.416
The Reich had these things.

01:31:27.125 --> 01:31:29.125
Insignia.

01:31:29.291 --> 01:31:32.250
Esoteric ritual.

01:31:32.416 --> 01:31:35.583
These "Mothers," yeah,
they could be

01:31:35.750 --> 01:31:39.083
code names for founding members

01:31:39.250 --> 01:31:41.625
with metaphoric histories.

01:31:41.791 --> 01:31:44.083
I don't know.

01:31:44.250 --> 01:31:48.916
But I do know you are living
with dangerous people.

01:31:49.083 --> 01:31:51.250
Patricia could still be in...

01:31:51.416 --> 01:31:52.416
...in there.

01:31:56.958 --> 01:31:58.767
They could be holding her.

01:31:58.791 --> 01:32:00.416
In the building.

01:32:00.583 --> 01:32:02.708
Well, I cannot promise
that the authorities

01:32:02.875 --> 01:32:05.833
will come back to, uh,
inspect a cabinet

01:32:06.000 --> 01:32:10.416
full of porcelain
after all that has happened.

01:32:10.583 --> 01:32:12.833
But we can try.

01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:16.791
And in the meantime, you must,
uh, take care of yourself.

01:32:16.958 --> 01:32:18.875
Perhaps you should leave.

01:32:19.041 --> 01:32:20.541
You have somewhere you can go?

01:32:22.791 --> 01:32:25.250
I'll figure it out.

01:32:25.416 --> 01:32:28.208
And I think you should
put this back.

01:32:28.375 --> 01:32:30.291
Or better still,
you leave it here.

01:32:32.375 --> 01:32:34.500
Not good for them
to know that you have it.

01:34:07.375 --> 01:34:09.750
Is anyone among you sick?

01:34:09.916 --> 01:34:12.541
Let him call for the elders
of the church;

01:34:12.708 --> 01:34:15.083
and let them pray over him,

01:34:15.250 --> 01:34:18.791
anointing him with oil
in the name of the Lord.

01:34:18.958 --> 01:34:24.333
And the prayer of faith
shall save him that is sick,

01:34:24.500 --> 01:34:27.500
and the Lord
shall raise him up;

01:34:27.666 --> 01:34:31.791
and if he has committed sins...

01:34:31.958 --> 01:34:33.875
My daughter.

01:34:36.791 --> 01:34:38.833
...they shall be forgiven him.

01:34:42.916 --> 01:34:44.791
My last one.

01:34:46.708 --> 01:34:50.625
She's my sin.

01:34:50.791 --> 01:34:53.875
She's what I smeared
on the world.

01:35:35.041 --> 01:35:38.583
You're making some kind
of deal with them.

01:35:38.750 --> 01:35:41.083
I don't know
what you're talking about.

01:35:42.708 --> 01:35:44.041
How can you know

01:35:44.208 --> 01:35:45.768
what they're going
to ask you in return?

01:35:45.833 --> 01:35:48.916
Sara, whatever you have
in your mind,

01:35:49.083 --> 01:35:52.375
nothing is wrong.

01:35:52.541 --> 01:35:54.375
You just haven't
seen the bill yet.

01:35:56.500 --> 01:35:58.125
Nothing's wrong.

01:36:56.916 --> 01:36:58.583
What's the matter with you?

01:36:58.750 --> 01:37:00.458
Huh?

01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:09.416
You don't be so afraid
about the white, Susie.

01:37:09.583 --> 01:37:12.916
They need to see you
from the very back row.

01:37:21.250 --> 01:37:22.666
Where is Sara?

01:37:24.250 --> 01:37:26.583
She came early in the morning,

01:37:26.750 --> 01:37:28.666
did her makeup and left.

01:38:20.041 --> 01:38:21.041
Girls!

01:38:21.166 --> 01:38:23.250
Vier minuten!

01:38:23.416 --> 01:38:24.750
Four minutes!

01:38:27.708 --> 01:38:30.666
Vier minuten!

01:38:30.833 --> 01:38:32.541
Tak, tak.

01:39:14.791 --> 01:39:15.916
Is it true?

01:39:16.083 --> 01:39:17.083
Sara.

01:39:18.500 --> 01:39:20.166
Sara.

01:39:20.333 --> 01:39:21.750
Patricia.

01:39:23.041 --> 01:39:26.041
Patricia. Patricia.

01:39:26.208 --> 01:39:28.708
- I knew it.
- They'll kill him.

01:39:28.875 --> 01:39:30.750
I'm sorry it took me so long.

01:39:30.916 --> 01:39:32.875
I'm so sorry.

01:39:33.041 --> 01:39:35.125
What did they do to you?

01:39:35.291 --> 01:39:37.750
I wake up here every day.

01:39:37.916 --> 01:39:39.708
It's all over now.
I'll get you out.

01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:42.458
The performance
is starting upstairs.

01:39:42.625 --> 01:39:45.291
Everyone will be looking
the other way.

01:39:45.458 --> 01:39:47.875
Get up. Get up.

01:39:48.041 --> 01:39:49.166
Patricia!

01:39:50.291 --> 01:39:52.583
- Patricia, get up.
- I'm trying.

01:39:52.750 --> 01:39:53.916
Get up.

01:40:05.208 --> 01:40:09.208
Get it off of me!

01:40:09.375 --> 01:40:10.750
Sara!

01:40:43.791 --> 01:40:47.333
Markos! Markos! Markos! Markos!

01:41:08.875 --> 01:41:10.083
Marketa.

01:41:10.250 --> 01:41:11.708
Where is Sara?

01:41:11.875 --> 01:41:12.666
Sara?

01:41:12.833 --> 01:41:13.916
I don't know.

01:41:14.083 --> 01:41:15.875
- Is she upstairs?
- No. I looked.

01:41:16.041 --> 01:41:18.125
Just dance
as if she's with you.

01:41:27.291 --> 01:41:28.916
Sara!

01:41:51.208 --> 01:41:52.208
Go!

01:43:45.875 --> 01:43:46.916
No.

01:43:48.541 --> 01:43:51.000
- No.
- Sara, lie still.

01:43:51.166 --> 01:43:53.083
- No!
- Sara.

01:43:56.291 --> 01:43:59.916
Please. Please...

01:44:04.750 --> 01:44:07.541
No! No!

01:48:16.666 --> 01:48:17.666
Sara!

01:49:02.958 --> 01:49:04.208
Good.

01:49:04.375 --> 01:49:06.125
Good. That's good.

01:50:22.375 --> 01:50:24.335
I'm sorry I went off book.

01:50:30.750 --> 01:50:32.833
This can't happen again.

01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:37.250
You're only just starting
to understand, Susie.

01:50:37.416 --> 01:50:38.958
We brought Sara back upstairs

01:50:39.125 --> 01:50:41.416
to try to complete
the performance in time,

01:50:41.583 --> 01:50:44.166
but then you derailed it.

01:50:44.333 --> 01:50:46.375
Did I hurt those people?

01:50:46.541 --> 01:50:47.916
Not this time.

01:50:48.083 --> 01:50:49.416
They saw a dance.

01:50:49.583 --> 01:50:50.583
That's all.

01:50:52.583 --> 01:50:55.875
It's all a mess, isn't it?

01:50:56.041 --> 01:50:58.166
The one out there.

01:50:58.333 --> 01:50:59.875
The one in here.

01:51:02.875 --> 01:51:04.291
The one that's coming.

01:51:08.750 --> 01:51:11.166
Why is everyone

01:51:11.333 --> 01:51:14.000
so ready to think
the worst is over?

01:51:33.083 --> 01:51:35.166
I could
explain everything to you.

01:51:37.583 --> 01:51:39.958
I think it would be wrong,
though.

01:52:14.333 --> 01:52:17.500
One, two, three, four.

01:52:17.666 --> 01:52:21.541
One, two, three, four.

01:52:21.708 --> 01:52:25.625
One, two, three, four.

01:52:25.791 --> 01:52:29.583
- One, two, three, four.
- ♪ Open again ♪

01:52:29.750 --> 01:52:33.458
One, two, three, four.

01:52:33.625 --> 01:52:37.208
One, two,
three, four.

01:52:37.375 --> 01:52:39.708
♪ We breathe again ♪

01:52:43.208 --> 01:52:48.458

Herr Doktor.

02:04:33.958 --> 02:04:35.500
I'm ready, Madame.

02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:03.208
You look afraid.

02:05:05.625 --> 02:05:07.541
She's afraid for you.

02:05:23.750 --> 02:05:27.500
There will be nothing of you

02:05:27.666 --> 02:05:31.500
left inside.

02:05:31.666 --> 02:05:37.250
Only space for me.

02:05:37.416 --> 02:05:39.875
I came here for this.

02:05:42.541 --> 02:05:43.958
You've all waited long enough.

02:05:44.125 --> 02:05:46.208
Ah!

02:05:46.375 --> 02:05:49.250
It is happening.

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:52.625
It is happening!

02:06:35.708 --> 02:06:39.333
Do you come here willingly?

02:06:39.500 --> 02:06:41.250
Hmm?

02:06:42.416 --> 02:06:43.416
Huh?

02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.250
You must have no doubts, Susie.

02:06:45.416 --> 02:06:47.750
If you do, I can take you back.

02:06:47.916 --> 02:06:50.458
I can take all of this
from your head.

02:06:50.625 --> 02:06:52.750
You can forget everything.

02:06:55.166 --> 02:06:58.333
I want this to be pure.

02:06:58.500 --> 02:07:02.541
We all know what you want.

02:07:06.833 --> 02:07:09.958
This isn't vanity.

02:07:10.125 --> 02:07:12.875
This isn't...

02:07:13.041 --> 02:07:14.958
art!

02:07:17.125 --> 02:07:19.208
There is something wrong here.

02:07:19.375 --> 02:07:20.500
Can you not feel it?

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:22.666
This is not right.

02:07:22.833 --> 02:07:24.000
We have to stop this now.

02:07:24.166 --> 02:07:26.833
We have been on

02:07:27.000 --> 02:07:29.041
two sides of this

02:07:29.208 --> 02:07:31.041
for too long now.

02:07:31.208 --> 02:07:33.750
Markos! Markos! Markos!

02:07:33.916 --> 02:07:37.583
Markos! Markos!
Markos! Markos!

02:07:37.750 --> 02:07:40.125
Markos! Markos! Markos!

02:07:40.291 --> 02:07:41.958
Markos! Markos!

02:07:42.125 --> 02:07:44.333
Markos! Markos! Markos!

02:07:44.500 --> 02:07:46.833
Markos! Markos!

02:08:18.000 --> 02:08:21.541
If you accept me,

02:08:21.708 --> 02:08:26.791
you must put down
the woman who bore you.

02:08:29.166 --> 02:08:32.375
Think of that false mother now.

02:08:45.208 --> 02:08:48.500
Reject her.

02:08:48.666 --> 02:08:50.583
Expel her.

02:08:54.375 --> 02:09:00.416
You have the only mother
you need here.

02:09:00.583 --> 02:09:03.583
Death to any other mother.

02:09:03.750 --> 02:09:04.750
Say it.

02:09:05.625 --> 02:09:09.166
Death to any other mother.

02:09:40.041 --> 02:09:41.750
Who are you?

02:09:48.166 --> 02:09:50.833
For whom were you anointed?

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:53.708
Which of the Three Mothers?

02:09:53.875 --> 02:09:55.833
Mother...

02:10:00.791 --> 02:10:03.833
Mother Suspiriorum.

02:10:06.666 --> 02:10:09.250
I am she.

02:10:47.750 --> 02:10:48.791
Markos.

02:11:03.625 --> 02:11:04.625
Markos!

I wasn't in a position
to prevent it.

02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:33.458
I believe you deserve
to know the truth.

02:21:42.708 --> 02:21:47.333
Your wife did try
to make it south

02:21:47.500 --> 02:21:49.000
to Teplice.

02:21:51.083 --> 02:21:55.041
She was apprehended
by border guards

02:21:55.208 --> 02:21:58.333
in the woods
just outside of Glashuütte.

02:22:01.666 --> 02:22:06.666
She was then taken
to Theresienstadt camp.

02:22:09.375 --> 02:22:11.833
She lived there for 20 days.

02:22:13.750 --> 02:22:18.791
On the 11th of November, 1943,

02:22:18.958 --> 02:22:23.208
the commandant of the camp,
a man named Burger...

02:22:24.791 --> 02:22:27.625
...ordered all 40,000
detained there

02:22:27.791 --> 02:22:32.458
stand outside in the cold
for a census.

02:22:38.625 --> 02:22:40.666
Hours and hours passed.

02:22:44.541 --> 02:22:46.625
Some hundreds died of exposure.

02:22:55.791 --> 02:22:58.333
Your wife had two women
with her as she died.

02:23:00.791 --> 02:23:04.375
Women she had befriended,

02:23:04.541 --> 02:23:07.208
who made her feel
that she was not alone.

02:23:14.625 --> 02:23:18.333
Her final thoughts...

02:23:18.500 --> 02:23:22.041
were of a birthday

02:23:22.208 --> 02:23:26.166
when you took her
to a concert as a surprise.

02:23:26.333 --> 02:23:28.875
Chopin and Brahms.

02:23:33.375 --> 02:23:35.583
It was the first time
you held her hand.

02:23:41.708 --> 02:23:44.458
She was cold when she died.

02:23:47.958 --> 02:23:49.458
But she wasn't afraid.

02:23:54.041 --> 02:23:56.250
She was thinking only of you.

02:24:15.833 --> 02:24:17.708
Of Anke Meier...

02:24:20.166 --> 02:24:21.875

of your undoing...

02:24:39.250 --> 02:24:41.958
...every memory will vanish.

02:24:46.250 --> 02:24:49.791
They will melt away in the sun

02:24:49.958 --> 02:24:51.166
