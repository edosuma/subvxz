BUT I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA
WHAT THAT COULD BE.

18:00.746 --> 18:01.997
- NOUGAT.

18:02.831 --> 18:03.957
THINK ABOUT IT.

18:04.041 --> 18:06.502
AT THE CENTER OF EVERY
SWEET CANDY IS NOUGAT,

18:06.585 --> 18:09.213
AND EARTH IS
THE SWEETEST PLANET.

18:09.296 --> 18:11.256
ERGO, NOUGAT.

18:11.340 --> 18:12.841
- THAT'S A GOOD GUESS, B.O.B.

18:12.925 --> 18:16.678
- UH, YES, BUT SQWEEB'S QUIZ
DEMANDS MORE THAN GUESSWORK.

18:16.762 --> 18:17.721
WITH THE CHILD STILL MISSING,

18:17.805 --> 18:19.223
THE ONLY WAY
TO SOLVE THIS MYSTERY

18:19.306 --> 18:24.436
IS TO GO TO THE CENTER
OF THE EARTH!

18:24.520 --> 18:25.979
[crashing]

18:26.063 --> 18:27.189
SORRY!

18:38.784 --> 18:41.286
- GREETINGS, LITTLE FAIL-IEN.

18:41.370 --> 18:43.789
- DOC, SPEAK TO ME.
WHAT DO YOU SEE?

18:43.872 --> 18:46.750
- MOSTLY BROWN,
SOMETIMES DARK BROWN.

18:46.834 --> 18:49.419
- I MISS YOU!
BRING ME A PRESENT!

18:49.503 --> 18:50.712
- YOU'RE PRETTY FAR DOWN.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.631
YOU SHOULD BE COMING UP
ON THE CORE ANY MINUTE.

18:52.714 --> 18:53.715
- YEAH, AT THE SAME TIME,
TICK TOCK.

18:53.799 --> 18:55.801
BETTER STEP ON THE GAS.

18:55.884 --> 18:57.719
- ACKNOWLEDGED.

18:57.803 --> 19:00.264
GOING QUITE FAST NOW, REALLY M--
OOF!

19:00.347 --> 19:01.431
- MOOF?

19:01.515 --> 19:03.642
- I SEEM TO HAVE FOUND THE CORE,

19:03.725 --> 19:06.645
AND IT APPEARS TO BE
NICKEL, IRON,

19:06.728 --> 19:08.897
AND OTHER TRACE ELEMENTS.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.733
- COULD SQWEEP'S PEOPLE
BE WRONG?

19:11.817 --> 19:13.026
- AND WHAT DO WE PUT
ON THE QUIZ?

19:13.110 --> 19:14.736
- I HAVEN'T THE FAINTEST IDEA.

19:14.820 --> 19:17.072
- GUYS, YOU'RE OVERLOOKING
THE OBVIOUS.

19:17.155 --> 19:21.451
WHAT IF THERE'S SOMETHING
IN THE CENTER OF THE CENTER?

19:23.453 --> 19:24.872
- IT'S WORTH A TRY.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.373
TO THE CENTER OF THE CENTER.

19:28.625 --> 19:30.752
YES, I'M BREAKING THROUGH.

19:30.836 --> 19:33.714
AND THERE IS SOMETHING
IN THE CORE.

19:33.797 --> 19:35.007
- WHAT?

19:35.090 --> 19:36.258
WHAT IS IT?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.179
- IT'S--IT--

19:41.263 --> 19:41.805
I THINK

19:41.889 --> 19:42.931
IT'S NOUGAT.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.725
Susan and Link: NOUGAT?

19:44.808 --> 19:45.767
- B.O.B. FOR THE WIN.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.853
[nougat gurgling]

19:47.936 --> 19:50.647
- MMM, YES, DEFINITELY NOUGAT.

19:50.731 --> 19:53.108
RICH, CREAMY,

19:53.192 --> 19:54.943
QUITE DELICIOUS, IN FACT,

19:55.027 --> 19:57.446
THOUGH IT MAKES NOT A WHIT
OF SCIENTIFIC SENSE.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.530
[computer beeping]

19:58.614 --> 19:59.823
- RESUME TEST.

19:59.907 --> 20:02.284
WHAT IS THE COMPOSITION
OF THE EARTH'S CORE?

20:02.367 --> 20:04.036
- THE ANSWER IS...NOUGAT?

20:04.119 --> 20:05.621
- CORRECT.

20:05.704 --> 20:06.705
CONGRATULATIONS.
PERFECT SCORE.

20:06.788 --> 20:09.333
[all cheer]

20:09.416 --> 20:11.543
- FOUND YOUR SHAMEFUL QUITTER.

20:11.627 --> 20:12.794
- OH, NO.

20:12.878 --> 20:13.962
STA'ABI, TELL ME YOU DIDN'T--

20:14.046 --> 20:15.130
- DIDN'T WHAT?

20:15.213 --> 20:17.299
VORNICARN,
SPIT OUT THE QUITTER.

20:20.761 --> 20:21.970
- WHATEVS?

20:22.721 --> 20:25.432
- PRECISELY.

20:25.515 --> 20:26.808
- WAIT, SQWEEP.

20:26.892 --> 20:28.936
YOU MAY HAVE CALLED IT QUITS,
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW

20:29.019 --> 20:32.022
THAT DR. C LITERALLY WENT TO
THE CENTER OF THE EARTH FOR YOU.

20:32.105 --> 20:33.440
- HE DID?
- YES.

20:33.523 --> 20:35.484
AND I'M AFRAID
THAT HAS PROVEN TO BE

20:35.567 --> 20:37.152
A RATHER STICKY WICKET FOR ME.

20:37.235 --> 20:38.820
I'M TRAPPED IN THE NOUGAT.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.113
[gasps]

20:40.197 --> 20:42.824
LOSING...OXYGEN.

20:42.908 --> 20:45.035
- NOT IF MAD SCIENCE
HAS ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.413
NOUGAT IS HIGH IN SUGAR CONTENT.

20:48.497 --> 20:50.666
OXIDIZER AWAY!

20:50.749 --> 20:52.000
[rumbling]

20:52.084 --> 20:54.586
I WILL NOW SUGGEST
EVERYONE DUCK AND COVER.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.260
- AH!
AH!

21:11.436 --> 21:12.479
- SO, YOU SEE,

21:12.562 --> 21:14.231
THE WHOLE UGLY AFFAIR
WAS MY FAULT.

21:14.314 --> 21:17.359
PLEASE DON'T PENALIZE SQWEEP.

21:17.442 --> 21:18.527
- AGREED.

21:18.610 --> 21:20.904
SQWEEP, YOUR PERFECT RECORD
IS REINSTATED.

21:20.988 --> 21:23.281
YOU MAY CONTINUE
YOUR EARTH STUDIES.

21:23.365 --> 21:24.282
HUGS!

21:24.366 --> 21:26.868
- HUGS!
THANK YOU FOR YOUR HONESTY.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.370
- OF COURSE.
JUST ONE LAST THING.

21:28.453 --> 21:30.706
I ACCEPT THE EARTH'S CENTER
IS NOUGAT.

21:30.789 --> 21:36.044
BUT MY QUESTION IS, WHY IS
THE EARTH'S CENTER NOUGAT?

21:36.128 --> 21:38.088
- OH, THE PRANKINOIDS
OF ARCON-5

21:38.171 --> 21:39.548
PUT THAT THERE EONS AGO.

21:39.631 --> 21:41.383
- PRANKINOIDS?
- YES.

21:41.466 --> 21:43.969
YOU SHOULD SEE WHAT
THOSE JOKERS DID TO YOUR MOON.

21:44.052 --> 21:45.804
THERE'S A REASON
IT LOOKS LIKE SWISS CHEESE.
