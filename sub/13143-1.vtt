00:32.145 --> 00:33.595
All new planes...

00:33.892 --> 00:35.539
Congratulation Mr. Avery.

00:35.895 --> 00:39.383
You're in the system, you're
good to go, so by next week.

00:39.814 --> 00:42.693
I can't come next week,
I have a business prospects elsewhere.

00:43.085 --> 00:45.785
Oh, good for you, sir. Are you
going to go work at another FedEx?

00:46.693 --> 00:48.826
Should go to window seven...

01:53.759 --> 01:55.724
In here.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.531
Is everything ready?

02:05.735 --> 02:07.608
It's $3,000, as discussed.

02:15.379 --> 02:17.813
The exact name you asked for.

02:23.987 --> 02:25.921
It's not a real...

02:25.923 --> 02:29.258
I mean, these numbers belong
to a real human being?

02:29.260 --> 02:34.496
Arthur J. Newman, born
Tulsa, Oklahoma, 1964.

02:34.498 --> 02:38.467
Died Visalia, California,
2010.

02:38.469 --> 02:41.036
A real human being.

02:43.975 --> 02:45.341
Good luck, Mr. Newman.

03:07.196 --> 03:09.030
I already did the mustard.

03:16.372 --> 03:19.207
By the way, did I mention I'm
going camping this weekend?

03:21.810 --> 03:23.144
Talbot Island State Park.

03:23.146 --> 03:28.549
well, it's right on the beach,
about 16 miles from

03:28.551 --> 03:29.484
Jacksonville proper.

03:29.486 --> 03:31.252
No, you didn't.

03:31.254 --> 03:35.289
Well, it was more or less a
spur of the moment decision.

03:35.291 --> 03:39.527
You see, I was thinking what
is the most economical

03:39.529 --> 03:42.296
vacation that I...

03:42.298 --> 03:43.531
that we could take...

03:43.533 --> 03:48.802
on my limited budget and, well,
it dawned on me I used

03:48.804 --> 03:53.840
to be a Boy Scout leader,
and I had a tent, and a

03:53.842 --> 03:56.977
sleeping bad, and...

03:56.979 --> 04:00.514
well, actually, I didn't think
you'd want to come, what with

04:01.109 --> 04:05.417
the sand, sea creatures, and...

04:06.722 --> 04:09.356
like I said, it was more
or less a spur

04:09.358 --> 04:10.957
of the moment decision.

04:14.395 --> 04:16.129
Thanks for the hot dog, Wallace.

04:16.130 --> 04:18.265
I got to go back to work.

04:34.083 --> 04:37.684
This is Arthur J. Newman calling
in reference to the

04:37.686 --> 04:41.520
380SL convertible I'll be
purchasing tomorrow.

04:41.522 --> 04:44.723
I was hoping I could
come in at...

04:44.725 --> 04:45.991
at 9 AM instead.

04:45.993 --> 04:47.460
I have an important
business meeting

04:47.462 --> 04:49.095
tomorrow, and I was hoping...

04:51.222 --> 04:53.363
No problem.
I'll see you at noon.

04:53.758 --> 04:55.468
Thank you very much.

05:44.016 --> 05:46.518
Hey.

05:46.520 --> 05:47.919
We saw you spying on
us again last night.

05:52.191 --> 05:54.859
I just came by to say I was
going to Talbot Island State

05:54.861 --> 05:56.895
Park today.

05:56.897 --> 05:59.497
Campground on a beach near,
uh, Jacksonville.

06:04.503 --> 06:05.770
Anyway, I brought you a gift.

06:05.772 --> 06:07.205
Just 'cause, uh...

09:25.067 --> 09:26.767
Hey, I'm Arthur Newman.

09:26.769 --> 09:28.135
Uh, how's it going?

09:28.137 --> 09:30.137
How's life treatin' you, friend?

09:33.775 --> 09:36.310
I'm Arthur Newman!

09:36.312 --> 09:38.812
Hey, there!

09:38.814 --> 09:40.614
Yep.

09:40.616 --> 09:43.183
Yep, it's Arthur New...

09:43.185 --> 09:46.253
Yep, it's Arthur Newman.

09:46.255 --> 09:47.654
That's me.

10:10.644 --> 10:13.246
I don't have a permanent
address yet, friend, but as

10:13.248 --> 10:14.814
soon as I get one, I'll
mail it to you so

10:14.816 --> 10:17.350
your form is complete.

10:17.352 --> 10:18.751
Good.

10:21.822 --> 10:23.990
Excuse me.

10:23.992 --> 10:27.827
I do not choose to partake
of pornography, sir.

10:27.829 --> 10:29.762
This is an extremely
inappropriate subject matter

10:29.764 --> 10:32.298
for public venue.

10:32.300 --> 10:33.666
OK.

10:52.387 --> 10:55.822
Get out of the car, miss!

10:55.824 --> 10:59.725
You stole my car, you
fuckin' crazy bitch!

10:59.727 --> 11:04.363
We're going to have to get you out

11:04.365 --> 11:06.465
of there, now!

11:06.467 --> 11:07.432
Whoa!

11:07.434 --> 11:08.433
God!

11:08.435 --> 11:10.068
I know my rights!

11:10.070 --> 11:13.572
I have a college education!

11:13.574 --> 11:16.007
Uh!

11:16.009 --> 11:18.276
Uh oh, here's trouble.

11:18.278 --> 11:23.482
Just call your wife, see if
she wants her car back!

11:23.484 --> 11:25.584
I just borrowed it!

11:35.796 --> 11:37.195
Show's over.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.563
Everybody go home.

11:47.975 --> 11:49.307
Yeah.

11:49.309 --> 11:52.010
My ex-husband.

11:52.012 --> 11:54.246
Actually, spying.

11:54.248 --> 11:56.014
You know what's crazy?

11:56.016 --> 12:00.652
When we were married, he avoided
Kevin like the plague.

12:00.654 --> 12:03.220
Well, and now...

12:03.222 --> 12:06.957
it's a strange way to
feel connected.

12:06.959 --> 12:09.493
You know what's so
sad about it?

12:09.495 --> 12:11.295
He was kind of great once.

12:20.540 --> 12:24.008
Good times!

12:26.946 --> 12:30.915
Yeah, good times!

12:30.917 --> 12:33.017
I want to have some good times!

12:41.259 --> 12:46.797
I like 'em fat, I like 'em tall,
I like them stubby, I

12:46.799 --> 12:48.866
like them all.

12:48.868 --> 12:50.935
I like them stubby.

12:54.339 --> 12:55.306
Hello?

12:58.709 --> 13:01.578
Are you OK?

13:01.580 --> 13:02.779
Show's over.

13:02.781 --> 13:05.815
Go home.

13:09.220 --> 13:10.587
Um...

13:13.390 --> 13:14.857
Don't touch me.

13:15.485 --> 13:16.953
OK.

13:19.264 --> 13:21.097
You need to see a doctor.

13:21.099 --> 13:24.067
Don't touch me.

13:29.874 --> 13:31.741
I'm going to try
to help you, OK?

13:31.743 --> 13:32.809
I won't touch you.

13:32.811 --> 13:36.713
I won't use my hands.

13:36.715 --> 13:41.184
You lift your arms up, like this, up.

13:41.186 --> 13:43.119
Put your arm around my neck.

13:43.121 --> 13:47.790
That way I can life you up
using my own body weight.

13:47.792 --> 13:50.593
No contact whatsoever
with my hands.

13:50.595 --> 13:52.894
Can you do that?

13:52.896 --> 13:56.331
Put your arm around my neck.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.733
OK?

14:01.170 --> 14:03.138
There, good job.

14:03.140 --> 14:06.074
No hands.

14:06.076 --> 14:10.746
OK, now, give me your...
give me your other arm.

14:10.748 --> 14:12.114
OK, ready?

14:15.652 --> 14:19.388
I can feel your hand.

14:19.390 --> 14:21.356
My name is Arthur Newman.

14:21.358 --> 14:23.859
Arthur J. Newman.

14:23.861 --> 14:27.629
Driver's license, Social
Security, any form of ID.

14:36.372 --> 14:38.006
Are you Michaela Fitzgerald?

14:40.544 --> 14:43.311
They need to know your name.

14:43.313 --> 14:48.149
Are you Mic... are you Michaela
Fitzgerald without peroxide?

14:48.151 --> 14:49.550
Call me Mike.

15:01.563 --> 15:03.798
How's life treating you?

15:03.800 --> 15:05.399
No complaints.

15:05.401 --> 15:08.869
Yeah, that's what
we like to hear.

15:08.871 --> 15:11.839
Hey, just out of curiosity, did
you happen to hear about a

15:11.841 --> 15:14.108
car theft around here
this evening?

15:14.110 --> 15:15.910
Woman allegedly stole a Chevy?

15:15.912 --> 15:20.014
You just admitted the gal.

15:20.016 --> 15:22.383
Actually, I...

15:22.385 --> 15:23.851
I'm just going a good deed.

15:23.853 --> 15:25.653
I don't know her.

15:25.655 --> 15:28.522
The guy with the Chevy didn't
know her either.

15:28.524 --> 15:30.224
Picked her up at the Beach
Comber, took her

15:30.226 --> 15:34.462
Had to drop the charges when the
old Mustang Sally fixed to

15:34.464 --> 15:35.863
call his wife from jail.

15:35.865 --> 15:38.399
Mr. Arthur Newman?

15:38.401 --> 15:39.967
Overdosed on what?

15:39.969 --> 15:43.403
It's a morphine-based cough
syrup, very powerful narcotic.

15:43.405 --> 15:44.904
She drank two bottles of it.

15:44.906 --> 15:48.875
When I asked her why, she said
she had a bad cough.

15:48.877 --> 15:51.845
We're cleaning her our with
an intravenous feed.

15:51.847 --> 15:53.346
She should be fine
in the morning.

15:53.348 --> 15:54.080
Cough syrup?

15:54.082 --> 15:55.482
She's in there.

16:08.729 --> 16:11.231
Hey now, don't you look
sharp as a tack?

16:15.503 --> 16:18.338
In case you don't remember,
I'm Arthur.

16:18.340 --> 16:22.509
I brought you here.

16:22.511 --> 16:26.980
Did I have sex with you?

16:26.982 --> 16:29.382
No.

16:29.384 --> 16:30.784
Absolutely not.

16:34.955 --> 16:36.522
Anyway, I just can't buy to...

16:36.524 --> 16:38.223
Don't leave me alone.

16:38.225 --> 16:39.525
...how you were getting along.

16:39.527 --> 16:41.426
Stay here with me.

16:41.428 --> 16:43.896
And then take me with
you in the morning

16:43.898 --> 16:45.931
when the sun is shining.

16:45.933 --> 16:48.233
Please?

16:48.235 --> 16:49.134
OK, OK.

16:49.136 --> 16:51.403
I'll stay.

16:51.405 --> 16:52.905
For a while.

17:11.691 --> 17:13.291
I'm not asleep yet.

18:28.533 --> 18:29.933
Hello, Mike.

18:32.536 --> 18:35.538
Well, maybe you don't
remember me.

18:35.540 --> 18:37.107
I'm Arthur.

18:37.109 --> 18:38.341
Arthur J. Newman.

18:38.343 --> 18:39.342
And I...

18:39.344 --> 18:41.645
I saved you.

18:41.647 --> 18:43.013
Well, I...

18:43.015 --> 18:44.414
I helped you.

18:46.584 --> 18:48.852
You said you'd stay.

18:48.854 --> 18:50.220
You left.

19:06.637 --> 19:08.138
Where would you like
me to take you?

20:04.294 --> 20:07.496
Should I put the top up?

20:07.498 --> 20:08.897
No.

20:26.415 --> 20:28.750
Would you like a hot
dog or nachos?

20:28.752 --> 20:31.319
No.

20:31.321 --> 20:32.720
OK.

20:39.695 --> 20:41.062
Forgot something.

20:49.471 --> 20:53.007
Is that where you
hide your money?

20:53.009 --> 20:54.909
I'm not hiding anything, Mike.

20:57.312 --> 20:58.179
Arthur?

20:58.181 --> 20:58.946
Yes, Mike?

20:58.948 --> 21:00.748
What's your story?

21:00.750 --> 21:01.649
My story?

21:01.651 --> 21:04.819
What kind of a human being am I?

21:04.821 --> 21:06.154
I mean, what's your story.

21:06.156 --> 21:08.456
I'm a golf pro.

21:08.458 --> 21:09.257
You mean...

21:09.259 --> 21:11.559
you're no Tiger Woods.

21:11.561 --> 21:13.527
Actually, Mike, I've won
quite a few prestigious

21:13.529 --> 21:17.464
But to tell you the truth, life
on the road is wearing me

21:17.466 --> 21:19.266
down, so I'm taking a gig.

21:19.268 --> 21:23.203
Resident pro at a course in
Terre Haute, Indiana.

21:23.205 --> 21:25.439
Were are you going, anyway?

21:25.441 --> 21:27.774
I don't know.

21:27.776 --> 21:29.776
Would you like a ride
to Terre Haute?

21:29.778 --> 21:31.378
No, I wouldn't.

21:40.354 --> 21:42.422
Where are the real hot dogs?

21:42.424 --> 21:43.657
Um, we don't have
them anymore.

21:43.659 --> 21:45.125
Just the tofu dogs.

21:45.127 --> 21:47.427
How is that possible?

21:47.429 --> 21:49.930
Not all of us want the
healthy alternative.

22:00.752 --> 22:02.300
Look, Mike, tofu dogs.

22:02.791 --> 22:04.791
Because I choose to be
health-conscious.

22:06.515 --> 22:10.116
I got you a small token.

22:10.118 --> 22:11.584
Thank you, Wallace.

22:11.586 --> 22:13.052
I love alligators.

22:13.054 --> 22:16.088
It's my pleasure.

22:16.090 --> 22:17.723
What did you call me?

22:17.725 --> 22:19.492
Wallace.

22:19.494 --> 22:21.894
Wallace Avery, right?

22:21.896 --> 22:24.363
I found it in the side pocket
of your golf bag.

22:24.731 --> 22:26.160
The trunk was locked.
I locked it.

22:26.558 --> 22:29.041
I used to work at Lock & Key.
I was really good.

22:32.005 --> 22:35.405
You know, on second thought,
I think I will ride to Terre Haute with you.

22:58.266 --> 22:59.665
Payments.

23:01.468 --> 23:02.834
Yes, this is Ms. Mina Crawley.

23:06.338 --> 23:09.307
Yes, I do know a Mr. Wallace
Avery, and you can tell him

23:09.309 --> 23:11.242
that I took the bus to
work this morning.

23:13.946 --> 23:15.313
Park what?

23:18.184 --> 23:22.153
What are you saying to me?

23:22.155 --> 23:23.555
Look, so you're phony.

23:23.557 --> 23:24.923
What's the big deal?

23:24.925 --> 23:27.492
One-way ticket to Durham,
North Carolina, please.

23:27.494 --> 23:31.763
I saw it in your driver's license.

23:31.765 --> 23:35.567
That's... that's not my...
look, I hate Durham!

23:35.569 --> 23:36.901
Does the lady want
her ticket or not?

23:36.903 --> 23:40.705
I reject the ticket!

23:40.707 --> 23:42.173
Get your hands off me!

23:42.175 --> 23:45.610
I reject the ticket!

23:45.612 --> 23:47.078
I feel dizzy.

23:47.080 --> 23:48.079
You're fine!

23:48.081 --> 23:50.048
My hands are numb.

23:50.050 --> 23:52.383
I got a sick man here.

23:54.954 --> 23:56.688
Is anybody a doctor?

23:56.690 --> 23:57.621
Wait, wait.

23:57.623 --> 23:59.056
Hang on here, now.

23:59.058 --> 24:03.260
He just started convulsing
or something.

24:03.262 --> 24:06.430
Who can help him?

24:06.432 --> 24:07.831
Someone's got to help him.

24:12.070 --> 24:13.036
Uh, I...

24:13.038 --> 24:14.671
I can't, um...

24:34.793 --> 24:36.526
I don't know how
to... somebody!

25:16.733 --> 25:19.335
Thanks for trying.

25:19.337 --> 25:21.137
Who is he?

25:21.139 --> 25:22.004
John Doe.

25:22.006 --> 25:24.040
Can't find an ID on him.

25:24.042 --> 25:26.342
Poor guy.

25:26.344 --> 25:28.144
What a way to go.

25:32.283 --> 25:35.117
Well, thanks for
trying, anyways.

25:37.455 --> 25:38.821
What is wrong with you?

25:46.096 --> 25:51.394
Poor John Doe, what a way to go,
poor John Doe.

25:54.404 --> 25:56.304
It's not funny.

26:05.448 --> 26:08.516
Oh, please don't make me get
on that bus, Wallace.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.390
That was a very funny
joke, Wallace.

27:29.030 --> 27:31.165
Getting lost on Talbot Island.

27:31.167 --> 27:32.533
Ha ha ha.

27:42.342 --> 27:44.210
Wallace?

27:44.212 --> 27:46.779
You can come out now.

28:14.575 --> 28:16.609
I can't sleep in my room.

28:35.929 --> 28:38.697
What are you doing?

28:38.699 --> 28:39.831
See my glasses?

28:39.833 --> 28:41.766
I thought I left...

28:41.768 --> 28:42.734
I thought I left them...

28:42.736 --> 28:44.135
No.

29:04.657 --> 29:09.227
His hands were all calloused.

29:09.229 --> 29:13.198
Especially his left hand,
around the wedding ring.

29:13.200 --> 29:17.102
How do you know that?

29:17.104 --> 29:19.170
Because I held his hand.

29:23.376 --> 29:26.378
By the way, that was very
kind of you, Mike.

30:28.573 --> 30:29.539
Same guy.

30:29.541 --> 30:30.940
Wallace Avery.

32:01.131 --> 32:03.031
How's life treatin' you?

32:07.737 --> 32:09.104
Keep the change.

32:16.178 --> 32:19.146
Who are you?

32:19.148 --> 32:20.514
I mean, really?

32:22.517 --> 32:25.219
I guess I've always
been Arthur Newman.

32:25.221 --> 32:28.022
Wife just forced another
individual on me.

32:28.024 --> 32:30.524
Wallace Avery was
such a nothing?

32:30.526 --> 32:32.793
Actually, Mike, Wallace Avery
was manager of a large,

32:32.795 --> 32:34.395
multinational corporation.

32:34.397 --> 32:36.597
What, like Blackwater
or evil empire...

32:36.599 --> 32:37.998
No, Federal Express.

32:40.836 --> 32:42.169
Well, I ran a branch in Orlando.

32:45.807 --> 32:47.808
Well, I was floor manager.

32:47.810 --> 32:50.644
Oh, Jesus!

32:50.646 --> 32:53.080
No wonder you want to
be Arthur Newman.

32:56.752 --> 32:57.785
Why the gold angle?

32:57.787 --> 33:01.088
I just happen to be a
very good golfer.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.728
Last spring at Diamondback
Golf Club, I observed a

33:08.730 --> 33:11.231
gentleman taking
practice shots.

33:11.233 --> 33:13.533
He had some serious issues with
his swing, and I offered

33:13.535 --> 33:17.270
him some, quite frankly,
valuable advise.

33:17.272 --> 33:20.140
And the next thing I know, this
gentleman grabs me on the

33:20.142 --> 33:22.876
16th fairway and he says,
"Sir, you are a godsend.

33:23.212 --> 33:25.301
I'm shooting like my old self
again. " And he tells me he

33:25.680 --> 33:27.981
owns a private golf club in
Terre Haute, Indiana, and I am

33:27.983 --> 33:29.382
welcome there any time.

33:33.020 --> 33:38.217
Well, that moment, Mike,
I had an epiphany.

33:39.757 --> 33:42.208
"Sir," I said,
"My name is Arthur Newman. "

33:43.257 --> 33:45.070
It just popped out of my mouth.

33:45.105 --> 33:48.601
"And I have recently returned
stateside after 15 years

33:48.603 --> 33:51.938
abroad on Asian tours,"
and did he need a teaching

33:51.940 --> 33:53.640
pro, I asked him.

33:53.642 --> 33:56.743
He shook my hand, and
he said, "Arthur,

33:56.745 --> 33:58.845
consider yourself hired.

33:58.847 --> 34:03.315
I'll see you in Terre
Haute next summer. "

34:03.317 --> 34:06.585
So you just ditched Wallace
Avery for a total stranger's

34:06.587 --> 34:07.953
half-baked promise?

34:14.994 --> 34:17.094
How very good are you?

34:22.302 --> 34:23.569
See that tractor?

34:23.571 --> 34:26.170
I'm going to hit it.

34:29.043 --> 34:31.009
Huh!

34:31.011 --> 34:32.010
Cool!

34:33.480 --> 34:35.112
See the truck?

34:46.860 --> 34:48.360
Oh!

35:13.553 --> 35:16.420
Can I ask you a personal question?

35:16.422 --> 35:20.324
I don't know, can you?

35:25.831 --> 35:28.232
Where you going to
go after we get to

35:28.234 --> 35:30.701
Terre Haute?

35:30.703 --> 35:32.169
I don't know.

35:32.171 --> 35:33.571
I guess...

35:38.076 --> 35:40.378
Don't you have a place?

35:40.380 --> 35:41.879
You know, a...

35:45.784 --> 35:47.285
A, I a home owner?

35:47.287 --> 35:50.454
Don't you have,
you know, a family?

35:53.925 --> 35:56.559
No, not really.

35:56.561 --> 35:57.994
No dad?

35:57.996 --> 35:58.962
No.

35:58.964 --> 35:59.729
Mom?

35:59.731 --> 36:01.031
Killed herself.

36:03.167 --> 36:06.403
I'm so sorry.

36:09.690 --> 36:11.118
You have siblings?

36:13.778 --> 36:17.714
I have a twin sister in
a loony bin, Arthur.

36:17.716 --> 36:19.916
I put her there for the fourth
time right before I met you.

36:19.918 --> 36:21.952
So you see, I really don't
have that much family.

36:27.658 --> 36:30.460
Twin sister?

36:30.462 --> 36:33.196
As an identical twin sister?

36:33.198 --> 36:34.597
Good night, Arthur.

36:36.901 --> 36:41.137
By any chance, does your twin
sister have short, blond hair?

36:41.139 --> 36:43.406
Lives in Durham, and you're
carrying her driver's license?

36:47.645 --> 36:49.878
You really think you're the
only person walking around

36:49.880 --> 36:51.046
with someone else's ID?

36:51.048 --> 36:52.781
How is this possible?

36:52.783 --> 36:55.384
I mean, you both...

36:55.386 --> 36:56.585
we're both...

36:56.587 --> 36:58.520
is this why you agreed
to come with me?

36:58.522 --> 37:02.157
Look, don't think this makes
us any closer, OK?

37:09.132 --> 37:10.532
So...

37:13.437 --> 37:15.004
Who are you?

37:15.006 --> 37:16.772
what's your name?

37:38.629 --> 37:40.029
Hey...

37:45.067 --> 37:47.068
so sorry.

37:47.070 --> 37:48.469
My questions upset you, Mike?

37:54.877 --> 37:56.277
My name is Charlotte.

37:59.681 --> 38:01.049
Kevin, over here!

38:01.051 --> 38:02.483
Watch me!

38:02.485 --> 38:03.451
Over here!

38:03.453 --> 38:05.887
Watch me!

38:08.124 --> 38:10.491
Fuck off, Jamie!

38:10.493 --> 38:14.195
Nice trip, dumb ass!

38:14.197 --> 38:16.597
There's someone here who'd like
to speak with you about

38:16.599 --> 38:17.965
your father.

38:19.535 --> 38:20.601
This is Mina Crawley.

38:20.603 --> 38:22.236
She is a friend of Wallace's.

38:22.238 --> 38:25.139
I'm a dear, dear friend
of your dad's.

38:25.141 --> 38:27.041
He... he spoke so much about you.

38:27.043 --> 38:29.010
It's a genuine pleasure to...

38:29.012 --> 38:31.579
you do resemble him here.

38:31.581 --> 38:33.448
Your father went camping
five days ago

38:33.450 --> 38:34.882
and he hasn't returned.

38:34.884 --> 38:38.285
At Talbot State Park at, um...

38:38.287 --> 38:39.319
at the ocean.

38:39.321 --> 38:42.589
The Atlantic Ocean.

38:42.591 --> 38:45.258
The police are searching for
him, but so far, they have

38:45.260 --> 38:47.461
found nothing, and they've...

38:47.463 --> 38:49.296
Crawley they're very concerned.

38:57.172 --> 39:01.108
Yeah, well, nice to
meet you, I guess.

39:22.296 --> 39:24.764
Hey, Charlotte!

39:24.766 --> 39:26.166
Charlotte!

39:33.707 --> 39:36.609
Why are you standing in the
middle of the street, Arthur?

39:36.611 --> 39:38.338
I thought you'd...

39:39.186 --> 39:41.069
Look.

39:50.725 --> 39:52.124
OK!

39:52.126 --> 39:53.259
Come on, Arthur!

39:53.261 --> 39:55.161
Let's follow them!

40:42.542 --> 40:45.510
Why don't we just return the
veil and get out of here?

40:49.982 --> 40:51.182
Oh, they're leaving.

40:51.184 --> 40:52.951
Let's just give it to them.

40:52.953 --> 40:53.851
No, no, no.

40:53.853 --> 40:55.887
Wait, wait.

40:58.024 --> 41:00.058
They're going on their
honeymoon, Arthur!

41:00.060 --> 41:02.168
Oh, that's very exciting.

41:03.027 --> 41:05.855
They are seniors, Mike.
I'm not sure "exciting" is the...

41:05.932 --> 41:07.298
Shhh.

41:30.055 --> 41:31.421
Mike.

41:35.560 --> 41:36.927
Mike, I don't like this.

41:44.369 --> 41:46.336
Mike, what we're doing
is returning the veil.

41:46.338 --> 41:47.471
Why don't you just...

41:47.473 --> 41:49.172
just leave it on the porch?

41:49.174 --> 41:50.574
Shh!

41:54.612 --> 41:56.013
Mike?

42:03.488 --> 42:05.656
Mike, just set it on the
kitchen table and... and get

42:05.658 --> 42:08.558
out of there.

42:08.560 --> 42:09.926
Mike?

42:12.563 --> 42:14.064
Mike, what are you doing?

42:21.739 --> 42:24.640
Get down here!

42:24.642 --> 42:25.941
Mike.

42:25.943 --> 42:27.343
Right now!

42:32.883 --> 42:34.950
Eugene, git on up here

42:34.952 --> 42:36.686
and act like a husband.

42:36.688 --> 42:38.454
Now, that is...

42:38.456 --> 42:39.622
inappro...

42:39.624 --> 42:41.657
take that thing off right now.

42:41.659 --> 42:43.759
You take it off.

42:43.761 --> 42:45.161
It's your honeymoon.

42:55.872 --> 42:57.473
Come 'ere, Gene.

42:57.475 --> 43:00.576
Lie down beside me.

43:00.578 --> 43:02.011
Mike, cut it out, really.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.412
It's... it's wrong.

43:05.615 --> 43:08.250
Wrong?

43:08.252 --> 43:13.489
Is love wrong on our weddin' day?

43:13.491 --> 43:16.458
It's not what I...

43:16.460 --> 43:18.660
what I mean is,
is pretending to be...

43:18.662 --> 43:20.929
We deserve to be
happy, Eugene.

43:27.069 --> 43:29.404
I'm not Eugene and you're not...

43:29.406 --> 43:30.805
I know.

43:37.680 --> 43:42.884
Let me be your joy, Eugene.

43:42.886 --> 43:48.123
Take my love, all of it.

43:48.125 --> 43:49.924
You'll be my happiness, too.

43:53.095 --> 43:54.629
Come 'ere, husband.

44:23.492 --> 44:25.893
Can I be myself, please?

44:37.439 --> 44:38.939
Oh, what the hell?

44:38.941 --> 44:40.307
Just skooch over.

44:45.613 --> 44:49.149
First thing I'm gonna
do in the AM is I'm

44:49.151 --> 44:51.485
going to take down those photos
by the stairs, and I'm

44:51.487 --> 44:56.457
gonna put up one great,
big, life size picture of you.

44:58.007 --> 45:01.781
Use the whole,

45:02.519 --> 45:07.741
the whole house, whole universe,
just to glorify you.

45:14.208 --> 45:16.642
Love you, you know that?

45:16.644 --> 45:20.279
Like the stars love
the night sky.

45:37.699 --> 45:39.065
Turn over.

45:54.114 --> 45:56.716
Sweet savior, you
are beautiful.

46:47.266 --> 46:49.768
Kevin.

46:49.770 --> 46:51.169
Do you live here?

46:51.171 --> 46:52.170
Uh, no.

46:52.172 --> 46:54.039
Or technically, no, I don't.

46:54.041 --> 46:57.274
I've spent a... a lot of time
here, a great deal of time

46:57.276 --> 47:00.144
Some wonderful time.

47:00.146 --> 47:03.514
What were you doing?

47:03.516 --> 47:05.349
Me?

47:05.351 --> 47:06.750
Uh...

47:06.752 --> 47:09.253
I was having some toast.

47:37.549 --> 47:38.949
Oh, my...

48:09.513 --> 48:10.680
Excuse me.

48:10.682 --> 48:13.683
I have to go to work.

48:13.685 --> 48:15.985
I've never been here before.

48:15.987 --> 48:17.654
Oh?

48:17.656 --> 48:19.922
He thought if he built a shrine
to me, he could make up

48:19.924 --> 48:23.059
for being such a shitty dad.

48:23.061 --> 48:25.194
Did it ever occur to
him I grew up?

48:29.566 --> 48:31.567
Oh, my goodness.

48:31.569 --> 48:34.570
Uh...

48:34.572 --> 48:35.938
You think he's dead?

48:40.878 --> 48:42.245
I don't know.

48:48.017 --> 48:50.952
Charlotte?

48:50.954 --> 48:51.820
What if we...

48:51.822 --> 48:53.321
Call me Mike.

50:04.893 --> 50:07.895
Come on, come on!

51:21.102 --> 51:26.372
Where have you been all night?

51:26.374 --> 51:28.374
Kevin?

51:52.800 --> 51:56.368
Stay with me, Mike,
in Terre Haute.

51:56.370 --> 51:58.136
We both want the same things.

51:58.138 --> 52:00.572
We both need...

52:00.574 --> 52:02.341
Live with me.

52:02.343 --> 52:03.876
You can be Michaela.

52:03.878 --> 52:06.345
I can be Arthur.

52:06.347 --> 52:10.249
We can both have the
lives we want.

52:10.251 --> 52:12.751
Finally.

52:12.753 --> 52:14.419
What do you say?

52:33.473 --> 52:36.674
The water pressure
here is superb.

53:28.326 --> 53:31.261
My mom was a paranoid
schizophrenic, Arthur.

53:33.764 --> 53:36.266
And so was my sister.

53:36.268 --> 53:39.069
You can't understand
how scary that is.

53:42.940 --> 53:47.711
How can I live with anyone?

53:47.713 --> 53:50.180
I'm a genetic time bomb.

53:52.985 --> 53:57.087
I hear that duck quack,
and I know it's a duck.

53:57.089 --> 53:59.856
But sooner or later, it's going
to be ducks sending me

53:59.858 --> 54:01.191
secret messages, telling me...

54:10.401 --> 54:13.069
When will it be over?

54:13.071 --> 54:15.270
When will I stop being me?

54:15.272 --> 54:16.805
Who says you will?

54:16.807 --> 54:17.940
Statistics.

54:17.942 --> 54:19.942
Someone with my family history...

54:19.944 --> 54:21.343
You're not a statistic, Mike.

54:21.345 --> 54:26.081
You're a person who can't defend
herself against her

54:26.083 --> 54:27.449
worst feelings.

54:29.853 --> 54:33.789
You feel the things most of us
run away from, the things most

54:33.791 --> 54:38.761
of us are just too bottled up to feel.

54:53.209 --> 54:55.644
Now do I have to
have sex with you?

54:55.646 --> 54:56.912
Because I really
don't want to.

54:56.914 --> 54:59.014
It's all right, it's OK.

55:55.404 --> 55:58.773
I can't get these sons
of bitches out.

55:58.775 --> 56:01.309
Will you help me, Arthur?

56:04.146 --> 56:05.612
Use the brush.

56:05.614 --> 56:07.280
No, the brush will hurt you.

56:07.282 --> 56:08.348
I need to use my hands.

56:08.350 --> 56:09.316
OK, go ahead.

56:09.318 --> 56:10.383
Just be...

56:10.385 --> 56:11.918
Careful, I know.

56:14.755 --> 56:17.090
Did you have any
kids, Arthur?

56:21.329 --> 56:25.298
I mean, did Wallace have kids?

56:25.300 --> 56:26.666
No, none.

56:55.930 --> 56:58.532
Arthur Newman world.

56:58.534 --> 57:01.534
Yes, we have golf communities
all around the United States,

57:01.536 --> 57:03.602
Let's check it out.

57:03.604 --> 57:06.238
Come on, Arthur, these
are your peeps.

57:17.617 --> 57:21.720
Come on, you can go now.

57:21.722 --> 57:23.155
What's the matter?

57:23.157 --> 57:24.456
I just feel a little dizzy.

57:24.458 --> 57:25.824
I just...

57:25.826 --> 57:26.725
I think I need...

57:26.727 --> 57:29.662
You need a hot dog.

57:29.664 --> 57:32.064
A pirate goes into
the bar, and the

57:32.066 --> 57:35.367
bartender says, "Hey, buddy,
you got a steering wheel in

57:35.369 --> 57:38.003
And the pirate says, "Aye.

57:38.005 --> 57:42.374
driving me nuts. "

57:42.376 --> 57:46.045
Did you ever win a trophy
like that, Arthur?

57:46.047 --> 57:47.580
How many?

57:47.582 --> 57:50.249
Like a few?

57:50.251 --> 57:51.884
A lot?

57:51.886 --> 57:54.620
A lot, a lot, or just a lot.

57:54.622 --> 57:56.654
A lot, a lot, I guess.

57:56.656 --> 57:59.190
How come such a hot
shot had to end up

57:59.192 --> 58:01.759
working at a FedEx, then?

58:01.761 --> 58:02.527
Arthur?

58:02.529 --> 58:04.285
He's choking!

58:05.405 --> 58:06.814
Arthur?
He's choking!

58:07.277 --> 58:08.967
He's choking!

58:14.840 --> 58:16.863
Another rough day for Wallace Avery.

58:17.410 --> 58:19.777
He was an outstanding amateur
but can't seem to catch a

58:19.779 --> 58:21.346
break since joining
the PGA Tour.

58:21.348 --> 58:23.414
I know, Frank.

58:23.416 --> 58:25.183
Looks like this once
promising player can't

58:25.185 --> 58:27.952
handle the big time.

58:27.954 --> 58:30.989
Right on cue.

58:35.595 --> 58:38.129
Nice job, Larry!

58:58.283 --> 59:00.284
I don't know if I can
pull this off, Mike.

59:00.286 --> 59:01.752
Pull what off?

59:01.754 --> 59:02.653
Arthur Newman.

59:02.655 --> 59:04.054
Of course you can.

59:04.056 --> 59:06.890
Just look at him.

59:28.047 --> 59:32.115
Hey, you want to
shoot a little pool?

59:37.855 --> 59:41.158
Oh, Jesus, you are hot.

59:55.972 --> 59:58.407
Come here, sexy.

59:58.409 --> 01:00:01.477
Oh, look what you have done.

01:00:04.781 --> 01:00:08.046
You know, I have to say, Mike,
you really are an excellent mimic.

01:00:08.481 --> 01:00:09.757
Mike is man.

01:00:10.297 --> 01:00:12.141
I am Ludmilla.

01:00:27.304 --> 01:00:28.671
Shit!

01:00:31.908 --> 01:00:32.908
Oh!

01:00:32.910 --> 01:00:35.378
Ow!

01:00:35.380 --> 01:00:37.346
Times you did that.

01:00:56.199 --> 01:00:58.099
Ludmilla!

01:01:07.543 --> 01:01:08.309
No.

01:01:08.311 --> 01:01:09.711
No!

01:02:01.896 --> 01:02:03.897
Golf.

01:02:03.899 --> 01:02:06.066
It's a mental game, a
mental component.

01:02:06.068 --> 01:02:07.835
That was lacking.

01:02:07.837 --> 01:02:10.904
Serious choking problem.

01:02:10.906 --> 01:02:12.573
Sorry to hear he's
dead, though.

01:02:12.575 --> 01:02:15.809
Yeah, really sorry.

01:02:15.811 --> 01:02:18.912
You can almost see
Avery's mind hijack

01:02:18.914 --> 01:02:21.114
his instincts.

01:02:21.116 --> 01:02:24.084
It's hard to watch a guy get in
his own way over and over

01:02:24.086 --> 01:02:25.886
again like this.

01:02:25.888 --> 01:02:27.387
Just a mental train wreck.

01:02:48.510 --> 01:02:53.980
Welcome to Terre Haute
Country Club.

01:02:53.982 --> 01:02:55.348
Thank you.

01:03:05.894 --> 01:03:06.792
Hello there, April.

01:03:06.794 --> 01:03:10.196
We're looking for the owner,
Chuck Willoughby.

01:03:10.198 --> 01:03:12.899
Unfortunately, Mr. Willoughby
has gone home for tonight, but

01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:13.766
I could call him?

01:03:13.768 --> 01:03:14.901
Don't bother, April.

01:03:14.903 --> 01:03:16.302
We'll be back in the morning.

01:03:29.082 --> 01:03:33.518
Do you want a dirty martini
with two olives?

01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.520
I'll have a martini with four olives.

01:03:35.522 --> 01:03:36.521
Four?

01:03:36.523 --> 01:03:37.923
OK.

01:03:40.526 --> 01:03:42.360
Should I, uh...

01:03:42.929 --> 01:03:48.555
should I call you my wife,
my girlfriend, or my fiance?

01:03:49.051 --> 01:03:50.936
Your whore.

01:03:56.043 --> 01:04:00.845
There's something I'd like to
teach you to do for me, Mike.

01:04:00.847 --> 01:04:03.315
Golf.

01:04:11.959 --> 01:04:14.092
This...

01:04:14.094 --> 01:04:15.627
this is a putter.

01:04:16.020 --> 01:04:17.638
- Oh!
- It's for...

01:04:18.318 --> 01:04:19.766
putting.

01:04:21.867 --> 01:04:26.503
Now the most important thing
is a light touch, extremely

01:04:26.505 --> 01:04:29.807
light touch on the club, like
you're holding a bird in the

01:04:29.809 --> 01:04:30.541
palm of your hand.

01:04:30.543 --> 01:04:31.342
Your were...

01:04:31.344 --> 01:04:33.010
I mean, Wallace Avery...

01:04:33.012 --> 01:04:34.244
were married, weren't you?

01:04:34.246 --> 01:04:39.617
Now, just tuck... tuck your
fingers together like so.

01:04:39.619 --> 01:04:41.118
What was she like, the wife?

01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:42.152
There you go.

01:04:42.154 --> 01:04:44.088
Good job!

01:04:44.090 --> 01:04:46.256
She a golfer?

01:04:46.258 --> 01:04:48.258
Did you teach her how to tuck
her fingers in, too?

01:04:48.260 --> 01:04:49.026
Bend your knees a little.

01:04:49.028 --> 01:04:50.761
Bend your knees.

01:04:50.763 --> 01:04:51.862
Keep some spring in them.

01:04:51.864 --> 01:04:53.831
Did you love her a lot, Arthur?

01:04:53.833 --> 01:04:56.000
Why no kids, huh?

01:04:56.002 --> 01:04:57.568
Is there something
wrong with you?

01:04:57.570 --> 01:04:59.637
Will you stick to the
matter in hand?

01:04:59.639 --> 01:05:01.505
What's the big deal?

01:05:01.507 --> 01:05:03.974
I told you all about the
insanity in my family, so

01:05:03.976 --> 01:05:05.376
what's a little infertility?

01:05:05.378 --> 01:05:06.610
There's nothing wrong
with me, Mike.

01:05:06.612 --> 01:05:09.513
Maybe you have extremely
weak sperm.

01:05:09.515 --> 01:05:10.748
My sperm's fine, thank you.

01:05:10.750 --> 01:05:12.016
You should probably get it tested.

01:05:12.018 --> 01:05:16.319
I think Wallace Avery is in
serious denial about his...

01:05:16.321 --> 01:05:19.155
I have a son.

01:05:19.157 --> 01:05:20.390
All right?

01:05:20.392 --> 01:05:21.858
There's nothing wrong with me.

01:05:26.563 --> 01:05:27.930
Arthur, I...

01:05:30.001 --> 01:05:32.368
Big whoop, you have a son.

01:05:32.370 --> 01:05:34.270
Why is that such a big secret?

01:05:37.941 --> 01:05:39.308
Arthur?

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:40.209
Uh...

01:05:40.211 --> 01:05:41.077
Chuck.

01:05:41.079 --> 01:05:42.412
Diamond Back.

01:05:42.414 --> 01:05:45.715
Yes, it's actually me,
Arthur Newman.

01:05:45.717 --> 01:05:47.116
We were told you went home.

01:05:47.118 --> 01:05:50.219
We were getting soused at
a bar down the road.

01:05:50.221 --> 01:05:51.754
Well, so were we.

01:05:51.756 --> 01:05:53.056
Your wonderful bar.

01:05:53.058 --> 01:05:55.425
By the way, this is
Michaela Fitzgerald.

01:05:55.427 --> 01:05:58.361
Whore.

01:05:59.895 --> 01:06:01.236
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:06:01.933 --> 01:06:05.568
Beautiful, beautiful.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:07.737
Remember that guy I told
you about, Gary?

01:06:07.739 --> 01:06:08.838
The pro?

01:06:08.840 --> 01:06:09.772
Diamond Back?

01:06:09.774 --> 01:06:14.609
I'm going to hire him,
work here, remember?

01:06:14.611 --> 01:06:19.414
Well, anyway, we're all systems
go, and then I Google

01:06:19.416 --> 01:06:23.251
him and find out there's no such
fucking pro ever worked

01:06:23.253 --> 01:06:26.021
the Asian circuits called
Arthur Newman.

01:06:28.491 --> 01:06:30.959
And here he is.

01:06:30.961 --> 01:06:32.861
With a whore.

01:06:34.164 --> 01:06:35.731
Fuckin' beautiful!

01:06:35.733 --> 01:06:38.300
What am I going to do, Gary?

01:06:38.302 --> 01:06:42.437
What am I going to do
with this liar?

01:06:42.439 --> 01:06:43.805
Call the police?

01:07:26.115 --> 01:07:29.049
I don't feel like talking
right now, Mike.

01:07:50.238 --> 01:07:53.607
What are you watching?

01:07:53.609 --> 01:07:56.944
The History Channel.

01:07:56.946 --> 01:08:00.080
Do you want to sit down?

01:08:00.082 --> 01:08:01.414
Sure.

01:08:14.361 --> 01:08:16.763
I read that how you rate your
life questionnaire my dad

01:08:16.765 --> 01:08:19.265
filled out.

01:08:19.267 --> 01:08:21.434
You did?

01:08:21.435 --> 01:08:23.703
Yeah.

01:08:23.705 --> 01:08:28.608
You know, he didn't... he didn't
rate you very high.

01:08:28.609 --> 01:08:30.376
Yeah, I know.

01:08:30.377 --> 01:08:31.810
But you got a 10.

01:08:31.813 --> 01:08:33.880
Guess that makes you happy.

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:35.448
He's full of shit.

01:08:35.450 --> 01:08:37.716
You know that, right?

01:08:37.719 --> 01:08:42.889
I mean, when I needed
him, I got zero.

01:08:42.890 --> 01:08:47.393
And now that I don't give
a shit, I'm a 10?

01:08:47.395 --> 01:08:51.531
I mean, fuck him.

01:09:17.057 --> 01:09:22.728
Kevin His name's Kevin.

01:09:27.533 --> 01:09:30.301
He's 13.

01:09:30.304 --> 01:09:32.470
He was 6 when my wife left me.

01:09:36.943 --> 01:09:38.877
She said I spend more time
with the cat than

01:09:38.879 --> 01:09:40.379
I did with my kid.

01:09:46.185 --> 01:09:47.653
Golf was the excuse.

01:09:54.726 --> 01:09:56.434
If I'm honest,

01:09:59.163 --> 01:10:01.646
the reason
I stayed away was...

01:10:10.042 --> 01:10:14.078
You hear about that overpowering
rush of love a

01:10:14.080 --> 01:10:17.481
parent feels for their kid?

01:10:17.483 --> 01:10:18.716
Well, for me, it was...

01:10:18.718 --> 01:10:20.151
You don't have to do this, Arthur.

01:10:20.153 --> 01:10:21.519
I really don't need to know.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:23.187
Drip, drip, drip.

01:10:29.361 --> 01:10:32.830
I couldn't feel the big ones.

01:10:32.832 --> 01:10:34.598
The stuff that runs deep,
I couldn't...

01:10:40.339 --> 01:10:45.388
so when you ask is there
something wrong with me, yeah.

01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:53.350
That was then.

01:10:53.352 --> 01:10:55.986
Arthur, look at you now.

01:11:00.358 --> 01:11:02.058
Do you miss Michaela?

01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:10.900
No.

01:11:15.339 --> 01:11:16.873
Think she misses you?

01:11:16.875 --> 01:11:19.209
No.

01:11:19.211 --> 01:11:21.277
Who takes care of her?

01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:24.547
Nurses and doctors,
professionals, whatever.

01:11:24.549 --> 01:11:26.349
I mean, who takes
care of her when

01:11:26.351 --> 01:11:29.019
she's not in the hospital?

01:11:29.021 --> 01:11:30.787
She's a grown woman.

01:11:30.789 --> 01:11:32.188
She can take care of herself.

01:11:34.825 --> 01:11:37.927
So it's obviously not you.

01:11:37.929 --> 01:11:39.329
Me?

01:11:41.664 --> 01:11:45.868
How am I supposed to take
care of a lunatic?

01:11:45.870 --> 01:11:46.902
Look at me.

01:11:46.904 --> 01:11:48.771
Practically certifiable myself.

01:11:48.773 --> 01:11:50.172
Just look at me.

01:11:53.209 --> 01:11:54.877
I'm looking at your back.

01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:08.190
It's just an act, isn't it?

01:12:08.192 --> 01:12:11.126
To avoid responsibility?

01:12:11.128 --> 01:12:14.997
For yourself, for your sister.

01:12:14.999 --> 01:12:18.700
For all the selfish things you do.

01:12:18.702 --> 01:12:20.669
Shut the fuck up.

01:12:25.241 --> 01:12:27.876
The elusive species that
I hope to get was

01:12:27.878 --> 01:12:31.513
the oceanic white tip, which is
considered the fourth most

01:12:31.515 --> 01:12:33.148
dangerous species of shark...

01:12:33.150 --> 01:12:36.385
I think I'm going to go to bed now.

01:12:36.387 --> 01:12:37.413
Of course.

01:12:37.860 --> 01:12:39.407
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:12:56.406 --> 01:12:58.639
This is your wakeup call, sir.

01:12:58.641 --> 01:12:59.574
Checkout time is 11:00 AM.

01:12:59.576 --> 01:13:01.642
Thank you. -Wake up, Mike.

01:13:47.222 --> 01:13:51.591
I won't be checking out today.

01:13:52.861 --> 01:13:54.528
Mr. Newman?

01:13:54.530 --> 01:13:55.428
It's the police.

01:13:55.430 --> 01:13:56.930
Please open the door.

01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:01.735
Do you know a woman named
Charlotte Fitzgerald?

01:14:10.077 --> 01:14:13.180
I'd just like to point out you
haven't read me my rights.

01:14:13.182 --> 01:14:15.448
I'd like to be given the respect

01:14:15.450 --> 01:14:17.851
due to a lawful citizen.

01:14:17.853 --> 01:14:19.853
You're not under arrest,
Mr. Newman.

01:14:19.855 --> 01:14:21.254
I'm not?

01:14:21.256 --> 01:14:24.591
We just want to ask you some
questions about Miss.

01:14:24.593 --> 01:14:26.660
Fitzgerald.

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:27.826
Is she...

01:14:27.828 --> 01:14:29.828
something happen to her?

01:14:29.830 --> 01:14:31.230
She's in jail.

01:14:31.232 --> 01:14:32.598
What for?

01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:35.234
Pick pocketing, down at the mall.

01:14:35.236 --> 01:14:39.104
When we arrested her, we found
$29,000 and change in her

01:14:39.106 --> 01:14:42.808
knapsack along with
other things.

01:14:42.810 --> 01:14:47.179
She says it belongs to
you and she stole it.

01:14:47.181 --> 01:14:49.315
Points for honesty, right?

01:14:49.317 --> 01:14:50.716
Do you want to press charges?

01:14:53.253 --> 01:14:54.620
I gave her the money.

01:14:58.892 --> 01:15:01.860
Mr. Newman, no one gives a
perfect stranger 30 grand.

01:15:01.862 --> 01:15:03.062
This is not a perfect
stranger.

01:15:03.064 --> 01:15:05.064
I have feelings for her.

01:15:07.867 --> 01:15:09.802
Deep feelings, matter of fact.

01:15:13.074 --> 01:15:17.910
You have feelings for
a klepto, mister.

01:15:17.912 --> 01:15:22.647
Do you know an Owen Hadley?

01:15:22.649 --> 01:15:25.149
No.

01:15:25.151 --> 01:15:26.517
How about these people?

01:15:30.689 --> 01:15:32.056
No.

01:15:34.994 --> 01:15:39.897
I don't suppose you, uh, know
Beauregard Tully, either?

01:15:45.204 --> 01:15:46.571
I, um...

01:15:49.141 --> 01:15:50.508
no.

01:15:54.547 --> 01:15:55.947
Excuse me.

01:16:15.267 --> 01:16:16.634
How much is her bail?

01:16:21.773 --> 01:16:23.293
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

01:16:24.610 --> 01:16:26.376
Do you want some toast?

01:16:26.378 --> 01:16:28.145
Why do you wear a bra
under your nightgown?

01:16:31.216 --> 01:16:35.852
I have some toast, and I have,
uh, jam and honey.

01:16:35.854 --> 01:16:38.388
What kind of jam?

01:16:38.390 --> 01:16:40.557
Strawberry.

01:16:40.559 --> 01:16:41.925
Jam, I guess.

01:16:48.833 --> 01:16:51.134
Did you and my dad have a lot
of sex in this apartment.

01:16:54.105 --> 01:16:55.439
Uh, that's a personal question!

01:16:55.441 --> 01:16:56.373
I...

01:16:56.375 --> 01:17:00.844
me to answer, Kevin.

01:17:00.846 --> 01:17:02.279
OK.

01:17:02.281 --> 01:17:04.981
Well, didn't you think he
was kind of boring?

01:17:04.983 --> 01:17:06.917
Focus on the positive.

01:17:06.919 --> 01:17:08.085
You're dad was...

01:17:08.087 --> 01:17:09.786
Come on, Mina.

01:17:11.856 --> 01:17:14.256
OK, he was incredibly boring.

01:17:14.258 --> 01:17:15.858
I mean, the lectures.

01:17:15.860 --> 01:17:17.226
Boring does not...

01:17:19.596 --> 01:17:21.063
I love him, though.

01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:26.001
I love him.

01:17:26.003 --> 01:17:27.937
Yeah.

01:17:27.939 --> 01:17:30.172
It's a lot easier to love
a dead man, isn't it?

01:18:28.231 --> 01:18:33.968
I'm going to try and
justify what I did.

01:18:34.370 --> 01:18:35.570
That's good.

01:18:36.949 --> 01:18:38.802
Neither am I.

01:18:41.649 --> 01:18:43.878
Broke into people's houses,

01:18:45.412 --> 01:18:49.975
ate their food, wore their clothes,
slept in their beds.

01:19:03.097 --> 01:19:07.501
But I didn't erase a man's life.

01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.570
That I didn't do.

01:19:12.874 --> 01:19:14.274
You take it.

01:19:19.214 --> 01:19:21.114
Did you even bother
to learn his name?

01:19:21.116 --> 01:19:24.952
Just take a look at that
stuff in there.

01:19:24.954 --> 01:19:26.420
It tells you a little story.

01:19:28.990 --> 01:19:32.593
His name is Beauregard Tully.

01:19:32.595 --> 01:19:36.363
Lived in Newport
News, Virginia.

01:19:36.365 --> 01:19:40.000
He drove a truck for Walmart.

01:19:40.002 --> 01:19:43.303
He was diabetic, went to
Alcoholics Anonymous.

01:19:47.075 --> 01:19:50.744
He had two kids,
John and Matt.

01:19:50.746 --> 01:19:53.580
He had a wife, Rosita.

01:19:53.582 --> 01:19:55.747
They were married 23 years.

01:20:13.835 --> 01:20:16.002
You Rosita Tully?

01:20:16.004 --> 01:20:18.137
Yes, I am.

01:20:18.139 --> 01:20:20.940
This is Charlotte Fitzgerald.

01:20:20.942 --> 01:20:24.477
We need to talk to you about
your husband, Beauregard.

01:21:20.299 --> 01:21:21.700
Coming in?

01:22:14.653 --> 01:22:18.422
You know what it's like,
don't you?

01:22:18.424 --> 01:22:20.024
Lose what you thought
you didn't want.

01:22:22.994 --> 01:22:24.995
Spend the rest your life
wanting it back.

01:22:30.368 --> 01:22:35.205
I need to go home and try and
let my son know I love him.

01:22:35.207 --> 01:22:37.841
You need to go home and see if
your sister needs your help.

01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:52.288
Family just crushes your
heart, doesn't it?

01:25:38.352 --> 01:25:39.719
Bye, Wallace.

01:25:55.302 --> 01:25:57.704
Don't worry, I know
where to find you.
