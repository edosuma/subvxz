WEBVTT

00:05.813 --> 00:07.078
Man, the last day of the seventies.

00:08.249 --> 00:11.085
You know, thinking back it’s like
one big blur.

00:12.816 --> 00:13.471
You’re welcome...

00:15.290 --> 00:17.730
You know Donna, it kinda sucks that
you are leaving for college today.

00:18.395 --> 00:22.179
I mean I kinda wanted to ring in the new
year by throwing out all your curduroy boy-pants.

00:23.431 --> 00:25.514
Well classes start on Monday
and Eric gets back at five

00:25.514 --> 00:28.321
so I just wanna like get out of here
before all the drama.

00:29.006 --> 00:30.024
Wait a second...

00:30.511 --> 00:31.227
If you’re actually going,

00:31.551 --> 00:34.211
then who is going to be the recipient
of Fez’ traditional midnight feel-up ?

00:35.543 --> 00:37.989
Well I was thinking that Fez’ll be
feeling up Jackie.

00:38.425 --> 00:39.797
I mean, she’s his new victim...

00:40.505 --> 00:42.602
I mean... girlfriend.

00:43.874 --> 00:47.309
Oh. I don't know Jackie and I haven’t
even had our first official kiss yet.

00:47.768 --> 00:50.726
Yeah it’s been a little hard making
the transition.

00:51.027 --> 00:52.850
Yeah and I don’t know what
to do because...

00:53.064 --> 00:55.967
now that she is not pushing me away
and saying "get off" it’s just awkward.

00:57.748 --> 00:58.768
Wait a second...

00:59.248 --> 01:00.668
Why are we wasting our time
talking about this ?

01:01.039 --> 01:02.836
Donna’s leaving town,
it’s the end of the decade,

01:03.153 --> 01:04.753
we should be doing something
awesome man.

01:05.072 --> 01:06.730
Something we have never done before...

01:07.207 --> 01:08.225
Or this.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.673
That '70s Show - 8x22 - That '70s Finale

01:19.511 --> 01:20.619
Wow...

01:20.842 --> 01:22.058
Wine at eleven-thirty huh ?

01:23.266 --> 01:24.548
Did you run out of Bourbon ?

01:26.632 --> 01:28.399
Well I am just a complete wreck.

01:28.919 --> 01:31.242
I’ve decided I don’t wanna
leave Wisconsin.

01:31.739 --> 01:32.685
D’you tell Red ?

01:33.089 --> 01:36.631
Well I... I’ve been trying to but, he’s just,
he’s so excited about Florida.

01:38.151 --> 01:39.933
Oh, but I’ve been dropping hints,

01:40.434 --> 01:43.008
I told him that sunshine makes people whistle

01:43.241 --> 01:46.393
because I know how much he wants
to punch those people in the face.

01:48.747 --> 01:49.417
Steven !

01:50.200 --> 01:51.432
Here’s a cheque for you.

01:51.689 --> 01:53.453
It’s for all the rent you’ve paid
over the years.

01:53.915 --> 01:56.409
I put it into a savings account so
you’d have something to get you started.

01:58.414 --> 01:59.633
Wow !

01:59.985 --> 02:02.216
This will buy me a monster bag of…

02:05.493 --> 02:06.957
marshmellows...

02:08.168 --> 02:11.873
Yeah well, you gonna need a place
to live now that we’re moving to Florida.

02:12.500 --> 02:13.561
Boy...

02:14.999 --> 02:17.380
It’s gonna be strange selling the house.

02:18.793 --> 02:19.778
That’s true.

02:20.459 --> 02:22.035
Plenty of warm memories…

02:23.032 --> 02:27.745
You morons just hung vacancy-signs
on your asses ! And my foot’s looking for a room !

02:27.964 --> 02:30.393
You know I had to vandalize
your ass with my foot...

02:30.393 --> 02:34.705
Sleep tight and don’t let the bedbugs
put their foot in your ass...

02:34.981 --> 02:37.562
How’d you like to own a little bit
of my foot in your ass ?

02:37.562 --> 02:40.886
How about I drive my foot into
this thing called your ass ?

02:40.886 --> 02:44.258
You know we could call in a specialist
to find my foot in your ass...

02:44.459 --> 02:47.847
My foot is about to drill a hole
in your ass...

02:48.246 --> 02:52.041
And you are about to read a book
that my foot wrote...

02:53.077 --> 02:55.753
It’s called “On the road to in your ass”.

03:00.249 --> 03:02.044
Did you ever actually do that
with your foot ?

03:04.256 --> 03:05.560
Once...

03:06.841 --> 03:08.180
On Iwo Jima.

03:09.931 --> 03:11.282
I can't talk about it...

03:17.717 --> 03:19.075
I love this song.

03:19.482 --> 03:20.563
Yes.

03:20.822 --> 03:22.600
It’s perfect for our first real kiss.

03:27.666 --> 03:28.474
What ?

03:31.053 --> 03:32.110
Stop it !

03:32.382 --> 03:33.601
You smiled first !

03:33.601 --> 03:35.426
Well I was thinking about tootsie rolls !

03:37.454 --> 03:39.557
Uh Fez, we’re forcing this.

03:40.555 --> 03:44.488
Our first kiss has to be romantic
and spontaneous.

03:45.709 --> 03:49.398
And as a guy, it’s your job
to completely plan that out.

03:51.321 --> 03:52.747
I hate being the guy.

03:53.644 --> 03:55.129
And not just because of this.

03:55.367 --> 03:56.855
The shoe selection is aweful.

04:00.046 --> 04:01.178
Oh, Mrs. Forman...

04:01.806 --> 04:03.133
I have here something

04:03.480 --> 04:05.448
that might make Red reconsider
about moving.

04:09.279 --> 04:11.832
Oh my God !

04:13.064 --> 04:14.972
Packers season tickets ?

04:15.392 --> 04:17.889
Red had been on that waiting list
for ever !

04:18.300 --> 04:20.302
Yeah my grandfather was
on that list for 30 years.

04:20.784 --> 04:22.760
When the tickets finally came
he was 90 years old.

04:23.952 --> 04:25.271
He ate them.

04:28.817 --> 04:30.119
How did you get these ?

04:30.560 --> 04:32.172
I used the cash that Red gave me.

04:32.753 --> 04:36.445
Oh I would hug you but
I know you don’t like that.

04:39.479 --> 04:40.442
Thank you...

04:43.836 --> 04:47.048
You are such a good boy !

04:48.159 --> 04:49.799
Alright Mrs. Forman, that’s enough.

04:51.527 --> 04:53.609
I’ll say when we’re done...

04:59.729 --> 05:02.164
Jackie wants our first kiss to happen
somewhere romantic.

05:02.424 --> 05:04.287
I wish I could bring her here
but this place is ruined...

05:04.956 --> 05:06.329
"Michael + Jackie"...

05:06.655 --> 05:08.257
It’s like going out after Sinatra.

05:10.375 --> 05:13.157
Yeah we’ve had some good times
up here man.

05:14.141 --> 05:17.030
My favourite thing was watching
how people got down…

05:19.000 --> 05:25.074

05:34.176 --> 05:35.550
This is a dangerous spot !

05:38.360 --> 05:39.732
There you guys are.

05:40.268 --> 05:41.262
KELSO !

05:41.262 --> 05:43.013
Hey man, when did you get back ?

05:43.888 --> 05:46.743
Man, c'mon ! I'm not going to spend
New Year's without my friends...

05:47.767 --> 05:50.617
C'mon ! Besides, it's, like the turn
of the century !

05:51.640 --> 05:52.860
It’s so good to see you..

05:55.037 --> 05:56.419
Did you just kiss my ear ?

05:58.628 --> 05:59.548
A little…

06:01.184 --> 06:02.321
I liked it…

06:03.653 --> 06:04.842
I’m so psyched, man...

06:05.061 --> 06:07.149
I got this like four-foot bottle rocket

06:07.515 --> 06:11.339
and then I’m gonna like tie it to my arm
and light it and just blast into the future !

06:13.274 --> 06:14.406
Hey you guys...

06:14.406 --> 06:16.301
I just thought of the perfect way
to put the seventies to bed.

06:17.012 --> 06:20.013
What do you say the three of us jump
of this thing one last time together ?

06:20.566 --> 06:22.287
You’re reading my freakin’ mind !

06:24.682 --> 06:26.011
Alright you guys ready ?

06:26.404 --> 06:27.025
Okay...

06:27.025 --> 06:28.913
One… two…

06:29.148 --> 06:30.639
Wait, wait.

06:32.297 --> 06:33.569
I know how this works...

06:34.086 --> 06:36.731
You’re gonna say three and
I’m gonna be the only one that jumps.

06:37.271 --> 06:39.505
Well if it makes you feel any better,
why don’t you do the counting ?

06:41.781 --> 06:43.611
That way we all have to jump !

06:44.200 --> 06:45.233
Alright...

06:45.749 --> 06:46.909
Here we go...

06:47.203 --> 06:47.956
One…

06:48.570 --> 06:49.978
two…

06:50.906 --> 06:51.524
three !

06:51.524 --> 06:54.080
AAAAHHHHAAAAHH !

07:01.771 --> 07:03.627
I just can't wait to see my Eric !

07:05.497 --> 07:06.726
I wonder what he'll look like ?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.917
I'm going to go out on a limb
and say...

07:12.601 --> 07:13.739
...skinny.

07:16.153 --> 07:18.334
- Hey.
- What the hell man !

07:18.334 --> 07:20.029
I thought you left for school like
three hours ago.

07:21.258 --> 07:22.845
I just want to see Eric
one last time, you know ?

07:23.695 --> 07:26.071
Show him that even though
he broke up with me that I'm fine.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.013
Uh-huh...

07:28.409 --> 07:31.452
Or maybe it's cause you still
looooove him...

07:32.995 --> 07:34.491
You are so off.

07:34.491 --> 07:36.629
- Oh he's here !
- Oh my God, how's my hair ?

07:47.246 --> 07:49.223
Where’s Eric ?

07:49.454 --> 07:51.209
The genius missed his flight.

07:54.279 --> 07:56.827
I circled the airport so many times...

07:57.129 --> 08:00.155
...that my finger actually hurts
from flipping people off !

08:03.367 --> 08:04.979
This is so typical of Eric.

08:05.542 --> 08:08.198
I let myself get all excited and then
he even doesn’t show up.

08:08.912 --> 08:10.830
You know Mrs. Forman I’m sorry,
but your son...

08:11.349 --> 08:14.195
is an inconsiderate jerk and
I’m so glad I’m through with him !

08:22.548 --> 08:25.045
Yeah, things are going great in Chicago.

08:25.946 --> 08:27.880
I even taught my baby daughter
how to say "Burn"...

08:28.588 --> 08:29.642
She doesn't use it right though.

08:29.888 --> 08:31.402
I get her a lot more than she gets me.

08:32.405 --> 08:34.142
Hey, you’re still doing security
at the Playboy-club ?

08:35.107 --> 08:36.731
Yeah. I got promoted to supervisor.

08:37.139 --> 08:40.525
I’m the guy who says :
"don’t touch".

08:40.874 --> 08:42.472
Can you believe that ?!
Me ?!

08:43.431 --> 08:46.416
Hey speaking of hot chicks, what's going
on with you and that stripper wife of yours ?

08:47.612 --> 08:49.201
Hmmm... not good, man.
She's gone.

08:49.401 --> 08:52.698
Apparently she’s not the sweet innocent
little girl she pretends to be
at the start of her act.

08:54.298 --> 08:55.288
That’s bad news.

08:55.881 --> 08:57.128
I totally would’ve done it with her...

08:58.658 --> 09:02.303
Man, Hyde, that was right on the bone.

09:03.833 --> 09:05.288
My arm’s all tingly.

09:05.698 --> 09:07.970
Just like your wife would have been
if I would have done it with her !

09:08.585 --> 09:10.048
Oww !

09:10.843 --> 09:13.509
Ah I missed this…

09:30.956 --> 09:32.789
Remember that time you shot me
with a BB gun ?

09:33.152 --> 09:35.254
I still have the BB stuck
underneath my skin.

09:35.794 --> 09:37.886
I like to play with it sometimes
when I get bored.

09:38.353 --> 09:39.856
Just like I would have done
with your wife…

09:43.766 --> 09:46.234
Awesome my tooth is loose !

09:52.464 --> 09:53.446
Okay Jackie...

09:53.995 --> 09:56.382
I think I figured out why we haven’t been
able to have our first kiss.

09:57.668 --> 09:59.125
We have too much history together.

09:59.459 --> 10:01.879
So... I thought that tonight...

10:02.190 --> 10:05.326
...would be romantic if I rewrite
some of that history.

10:06.541 --> 10:07.881
Look !

10:10.019 --> 10:11.515
Oh crap !
It was dark...

10:13.841 --> 10:15.496
This really shouldn’t be this hard.

10:15.988 --> 10:18.115
I just want everybody to know
how much I love you.

10:20.504 --> 10:21.692
I always have.

10:34.149 --> 10:35.721
That was really nice.

10:36.595 --> 10:38.236
Yeah... you have a really
strong tongue.

10:40.630 --> 10:43.209
Yeah, it's from all the talking.

10:51.176 --> 10:53.711
Just when I thought I can't like
Florida any more,

10:53.711 --> 10:55.804
they reinstate the death penalty !

10:59.156 --> 11:00.101
Red...

11:01.083 --> 11:05.069
you are not gonna believe
what just came for you...

11:07.937 --> 11:09.825
My Packer tickets ?!

11:10.104 --> 11:11.945
I know ! Isn't it terrific ?

11:13.220 --> 11:14.401
Fifth row.

11:15.110 --> 11:16.882
You can hear the knees
blowing out from there !

11:19.112 --> 11:21.777
I can't believe I have to
give them away...

11:23.204 --> 11:24.219
What ?

11:26.376 --> 11:28.388
I know how much you're looking
forward to Florida.

11:28.834 --> 11:30.012
I wouldn't do that to you.

11:32.926 --> 11:34.286
Red, I don't wanna move...

11:35.386 --> 11:36.068
What...?

11:36.529 --> 11:37.540
Well...

11:37.951 --> 11:40.458
I was gonna tell you, but ever since
we decided to move you...

11:41.077 --> 11:42.720
you've been so happy and smiley...

11:42.962 --> 11:45.700
and you're never that way except
for when you kill a deer.

11:50.587 --> 11:52.103
Red this is my home.

11:52.939 --> 11:54.214
I don't wanna leave.

11:58.358 --> 12:00.492
Kitty we don't have to go anywhere.

12:02.037 --> 12:03.672
I don't care where I live.

12:04.731 --> 12:06.397
As long as I'm with you...

12:07.024 --> 12:10.068
- Really ?
- Of course.

12:12.988 --> 12:14.320
Red...

12:16.241 --> 12:19.877
- I love you.
- Ohhh I love you too...

12:22.339 --> 12:25.204
I was...
talking to the tickets...

12:32.906 --> 12:34.952
- Hey.
- Oh hey man.

12:34.952 --> 12:37.005
If you're looking for Forman,
he's still not here.

12:37.005 --> 12:38.174
I don't wanna see him.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.520
I just wanna get drunk and ring in
the New Year with my friends.

12:40.748 --> 12:43.144
Oh...
Well in that case...

12:43.144 --> 12:44.835
welcome on board of
"Wasted Airlines"...

12:46.549 --> 12:49.903
Should you experience a loss of buzz,
a beer will fall into your hand...

12:51.045 --> 12:54.488
Please make sure to drink that beer
before helping small children with theirs.

12:56.063 --> 12:57.213
Everybody...

12:57.503 --> 12:58.798
...we have an announcement...

12:59.351 --> 13:00.643
we've decided...

13:01.647 --> 13:04.001
not to sell the house.
We're going to stay in Point Place.

13:06.435 --> 13:09.809
Hey, that's so weird, man. I was just
thinkin' of movin' to Point Place !

13:12.557 --> 13:13.722
Well...

13:14.195 --> 13:15.335
I am just...

13:15.766 --> 13:17.635
I am just so happy we're staying
because...

13:17.962 --> 13:20.683
I would miss you so.

13:23.377 --> 13:24.842
Like Fez...

13:26.792 --> 13:28.345
the way you and I have tea and...

13:29.284 --> 13:31.449
make fun of male ice-skaters...

13:33.718 --> 13:35.002
And Jackie...

13:35.400 --> 13:37.041
you're such a doll.

13:38.299 --> 13:40.995
I don't even mind your bad-handed
compliments.

13:42.491 --> 13:46.679
Ohhh Mrs. Forman,
you're my favourite old lady !

13:48.868 --> 13:51.583
Oh, and you too Leo...

13:52.315 --> 13:57.581
You always make my day when
you wave and smile hello.

13:59.203 --> 14:02.449
Even when you are urinating
on my mailbox...

14:03.444 --> 14:05.548
Oh, and Bob...

14:06.455 --> 14:08.960
No matter what I cook,
you can't pass it up.

14:09.651 --> 14:10.840
Kinda like...

14:11.044 --> 14:14.856
you can't pass up a woman's rear end
without yelling "Whoohoo" !

14:16.272 --> 14:17.867
Just being polite.

14:19.999 --> 14:21.659
And Steven...

14:22.907 --> 14:24.523
My second son...

14:26.023 --> 14:28.175
I adore you...

14:28.941 --> 14:29.800
But you know uhm...

14:31.105 --> 14:35.242
now that we're staying maybe you could
shave your mustache, because, Honey...

14:35.242 --> 14:38.339
you look like a forty-year old
male prostitute.

14:43.650 --> 14:46.109
And Donna, sweetheart...

14:47.157 --> 14:49.230
No matter where you go...

14:50.231 --> 14:52.804
I will always love you like a daughter.

14:59.406 --> 15:03.693
I'm so sorry things didn't work out
with you and Eric.

15:04.589 --> 15:07.634
Uhm...
I think I need some air...

15:10.680 --> 15:11.594
So...

15:12.178 --> 15:13.468
speaking of daughters...

15:14.292 --> 15:16.508
has anyone seen Laurie ?

15:18.428 --> 15:19.521
Now listen Bob, uh...

15:20.652 --> 15:23.843
I know that you were counting on me
for the bait shop and all...

15:24.265 --> 15:26.766
Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do.
I'm a big boy...

15:27.370 --> 15:28.762
I can make it on my own...

15:29.398 --> 15:31.737
I'm gonna miss you so much !

15:33.513 --> 15:35.811
Wow, you're getting really good
at this kissing thing...

15:36.756 --> 15:37.838
It's magical...

15:38.209 --> 15:39.641
I couldn't ask for anything else.

15:40.626 --> 15:43.216
So...
when do we get to second base ?

15:46.642 --> 15:49.059
Oh Mr. Forman, can I light this
off in your house ?

15:50.496 --> 15:52.983
Sure, and then I'll light my foot
off in your ass.

15:54.018 --> 15:57.914
And that my friends, is the last
foot-in-ass of the decade !

15:59.695 --> 16:00.921
Cheers !

16:03.389 --> 16:05.625
Michael, I just...
it's so good to see you.

16:06.061 --> 16:08.837
The girls in the emergency room
were just asking about you.

16:10.251 --> 16:12.385
You know, it's like
I've been gone for so long...

16:12.776 --> 16:14.364
I almost forgot you're a hot Mom !

16:17.631 --> 16:21.160
You know what else it hot ?
My foot when it's in your ass.

16:22.386 --> 16:24.800
Look at that.
He got one more in 'm !

17:17.763 --> 17:18.943
Happy new year...

17:21.222 --> 17:22.375
Eric...

17:23.832 --> 17:25.236
Donna I'm sorry I'm late.

17:26.508 --> 17:28.015
I caught the last flight out.

17:30.905 --> 17:32.879
So... uh....

17:34.866 --> 17:36.788
awkwaaard...

17:38.883 --> 17:40.320
So... how are you ?

17:41.608 --> 17:42.878
I'm good.

17:44.607 --> 17:46.091
I start college next week.

17:46.091 --> 17:47.447
Oh...

17:48.503 --> 17:50.437
- That's awesome.
- Yeah.

17:55.377 --> 17:57.638
So what, you just came back here
for New Year's Eve ?

18:00.563 --> 18:01.815
Look Donna...

18:03.828 --> 18:06.922
when I left I was so...

18:08.343 --> 18:11.246
positive that I was doing
the right thing.

18:14.134 --> 18:19.292
- But now I've been gone so long...
- Eric, things are a lot different now...

18:21.341 --> 18:23.099
I know.

18:27.540 --> 18:29.718
It's just Donna, I thought
about you every day.

18:34.771 --> 18:37.060
And you know what ?
It turns out that, uhm...

18:38.001 --> 18:39.344
Red was right...

18:41.934 --> 18:43.947
I am a dumb-ass !

18:46.634 --> 18:50.360
Donna, I'm sorry.

19:10.207 --> 19:11.489
So uh...

19:13.076 --> 19:15.581
- sounds like there is a party going on
in there ? - Yeah there is...

19:16.539 --> 19:18.432
You're Mom's like really drunk...

19:18.776 --> 19:19.767
Oh okay...

19:21.610 --> 19:23.369
Yeah I don't know if I'm ready
for all that.

19:25.277 --> 19:29.064
I wish there was just some way
to take the edge off...

19:30.445 --> 19:33.738
Edge, you are officially off !

19:35.092 --> 19:37.554
Eric, I have the most incredible news.

19:38.107 --> 19:40.116
I have kissed Jacqueline Burkhart !

19:41.096 --> 19:43.646
Yeah Fez.
I have some incredible news too...

19:44.346 --> 19:45.875
So has everyone else !

19:48.183 --> 19:50.539
I think it makes total sense
that Fez ended up with Jackie.

19:50.952 --> 19:52.976
She started out with me,
the Ferrari...

19:53.409 --> 19:55.772
And then she went to Hyde,
the Mustang...

19:56.171 --> 19:57.830
And now she's with Fez,
who's like a...

19:58.650 --> 20:01.906
donkey pulling a cart full of brightly
colored Mexican blankets !

20:02.979 --> 20:04.638
Oh hey Kelso, I almost forgot...

20:05.211 --> 20:07.370
I got you something from Africa
for your daughter.

20:07.370 --> 20:11.540
Check it out.
A genuine... plastic rhino-horn.

20:12.986 --> 20:17.699
Awesome !
Look guys, I'm a rhino !

20:19.343 --> 20:23.289
Guys, I think it's time we honor all
the braincells that survived the seventies.

20:23.838 --> 20:27.243
Despite our best efforts
some of those bastards pulled through.

20:27.714 --> 20:30.363
Tonight, they're going down...

20:31.691 --> 20:35.118
Die braincells, die !
And you're next liver...

20:36.852 --> 20:39.832
Hey... did you guys hear about
that car that runs on water ?

20:40.719 --> 20:44.779
It's got a fiberglass aircooled engine
and it runs on water, man !

20:46.875 --> 20:49.653
It's like we never run out of things
to talk about down here...

20:50.381 --> 20:52.062
I knew you burnouts were down here.

20:52.062 --> 20:54.734
You guys, it's almost midnight.
Mrs. Forman is pouring the champagne.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.616
Hey guys, last one up the stairs...

21:01.082 --> 21:02.776
has to call Red a dumb ass !

21:08.985 --> 21:11.268
Oh man...

21:25.240 --> 21:28.882
