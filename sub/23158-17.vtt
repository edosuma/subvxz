00:00.023 --> 00:01.854
I'm a high-stakes
poker player.

00:01.925 --> 00:04.894
And tonight, I'm in a game
with a collection of snakes.

00:07.030 --> 00:09.555
You're about the fastest
dealer I've ever seen.

00:09.632 --> 00:12.157
Could we leave the door open?
It's a little hot in here.

00:12.235 --> 00:14.226
You'll have plenty of
ventilation very soon.

00:14.304 --> 00:15.896
Get in the boat!

00:16.706 --> 00:18.799
We'll get them with
the chopper in the morning.

00:19.008 --> 00:21.203
Get us out of the mess
you've landed us in.

00:21.255 --> 00:23.815
I'm just the bodyguard
in the tuxedo, remember?

00:24.511 --> 00:25.500
J.L.!

01:51.343 --> 01:57.306
<i>Trans World Airlines' Flight
193 for Orlando and Jacksonville</i>

01:57.440 --> 01:59.635
<i>is now ready for boarding</i>
<i>at Gate 3.</i>

01:59.709 --> 02:02.473
<i>Flight 193</i>
<i>now boarding at Gate 3.</i>

02:02.545 --> 02:03.910
<i>Thank you.</i>

02:19.595 --> 02:21.893
Halt! Police! Police!

02:21.965 --> 02:22.954
Don't shoot.

02:39.182 --> 02:41.776
All you folks, stand back.
The man's a terrorist.

02:51.427 --> 02:52.860
Is it there?

03:00.570 --> 03:01.935
That's it.

03:04.507 --> 03:05.804
Kill him.

03:13.383 --> 03:16.477
<i>Life in the Islands
has an irresistible rhythm.</i>

03:16.552 --> 03:19.544
<i>Days merging together</i>
<i>like waves on the beach.</i>

03:20.056 --> 03:21.956
<i>That's why I've never</i>
<i>understood why people</i>

03:22.025 --> 03:24.289
<i>get so excited</i>
<i>over artificial events.</i>

03:24.761 --> 03:27.628
<i>For instance, a birthday</i>
<i>should be a private time,</i>

03:27.697 --> 03:30.063
<i>with maybe a run on</i>
<i>the beach to celebrate.</i>

03:30.133 --> 03:32.192
<i>Not the big,</i>
<i>embarrassing fuss</i>

03:32.268 --> 03:34.361
<i>a person's friends</i>
<i>always make over it.</i>

03:34.604 --> 03:37.072
<i>I should know</i>
<i>because it was my birthday.</i>

03:37.140 --> 03:40.576
<i>And I knew Rick and T.C. Would</i>
<i>be planning something special.</i>

03:41.044 --> 03:43.672
<i>What I didn't know was that</i>
<i>the day would be the beginning</i>

03:43.746 --> 03:46.613
<i>of one of the biggest</i>
<i>disasters of my life.</i>

03:54.824 --> 03:55.848
Hi, guys.

03:55.925 --> 03:56.914
Two cards.

03:57.460 --> 03:58.688
Whoa, I said, two.

03:58.761 --> 03:59.887
Trust me, keep that one.

03:59.962 --> 04:00.894
Hi.

04:00.963 --> 04:02.055
Hi.

04:02.131 --> 04:03.655
A royal flush?

04:06.402 --> 04:07.994
What's going on?

04:08.304 --> 04:10.101
How did you do that?

04:10.840 --> 04:12.967
Isn't it a little early
for card tricks?

04:13.042 --> 04:16.500
It's like drinking beer in the morning.
All a matter of taste.

04:16.579 --> 04:19.207
It's not morning.
It's lunchtime, practically.

04:19.281 --> 04:23.048
And besides,
today is kind of special.

04:23.119 --> 04:24.950
Hey, don't get distracted
by this turkey.

04:25.021 --> 04:26.784
He had the worst touch
for cards in Nam.

04:26.856 --> 04:29.757
On payday, people from three different
countries lined up to get him.

04:29.826 --> 04:32.124
Listen, just because
I wasn't obsessed

04:32.195 --> 04:36.029
with sitting in a hot, smoky room
with 52 pieces of cardboard...

04:36.099 --> 04:38.329
But you're a man of
many other skills.

04:38.401 --> 04:41.302
Including being a top-ranked
private investigator,

04:41.370 --> 04:44.362
who must look devilishly
handsome in a tuxedo.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.204
I'm Jeannie Lowry,
but everybody calls me J.L.

04:49.278 --> 04:51.405
Except some people
call me Texas Lightning

04:51.481 --> 04:53.381
because of the speed
with which I deal.

04:53.449 --> 04:55.713
Thomas, J.L.
Is a potential client.

04:55.785 --> 04:57.685
I'm a high-stakes
poker player.

04:57.753 --> 05:01.052
And tonight, I'm in a game
with a collection of snakes.

05:01.124 --> 05:03.524
These men are so obsessed
with winning that

05:03.593 --> 05:05.754
"They'd kill you as
soon as spit at you,"

05:05.828 --> 05:08.626
as my late husband,
Billy, used to say.

05:08.698 --> 05:12.828
And the head rattler in
tonight's game is Matt Thompson.

05:13.603 --> 05:15.833
Thompson
Electronics' Thompson?

05:16.305 --> 05:19.035
Well, it sounds like
what you want is a bodyguard.

05:19.108 --> 05:21.440
I don't do that kind of work.
Besides, tonight...

05:21.511 --> 05:24.002
T.M., we're talking
very big bucks here.

05:24.080 --> 05:27.049
Well, see, I kind of
have plans tonight

05:27.316 --> 05:29.580
with the guys here,
my friends.

05:31.487 --> 05:32.784
Oh, don't look at me.

05:32.855 --> 05:34.618
I've got a chopper full of
schoolteachers

05:34.690 --> 05:36.851
I gotta drop off
at the Big Island later on.

05:36.926 --> 05:40.293
Yeah, and I got a board
of directors' meeting here
at the club tonight, Thomas.

05:40.363 --> 05:43.423
Then let's get down
to gold tacks, Thomas. Money.

05:43.499 --> 05:46.093
Either I double
your regular daily fee,

05:46.169 --> 05:49.002
or 10 percent of what I earn.

05:49.172 --> 05:52.505
And I've been
known to win $250,000

05:52.575 --> 05:55.066
in a white-hot evening
at the table.

05:56.012 --> 05:57.502
$250,000?

05:57.580 --> 05:59.514
In a white-hot evening.

06:05.021 --> 06:06.386
Pull!

06:09.959 --> 06:12.587
Paulo Polo has just been
paid for his last film,

06:12.662 --> 06:15.495
so he has $500,000
in his checking account.

06:15.932 --> 06:18.958
Baron Von Klaus is flying in
from Berlin for the game.

06:19.035 --> 06:21.094
Our honored guest, of course.

06:21.571 --> 06:22.731
Pull!

06:24.373 --> 06:26.967
And one more player you may
find very interesting.

06:27.043 --> 06:30.376
She's a widow of an incredibly
wealthy Texas oil man.

06:30.446 --> 06:31.743
A what, a woman?

06:31.814 --> 06:33.645
Her international
reputation is that

06:33.716 --> 06:35.843
she's as reckless
as she is lucky.

06:36.219 --> 06:37.982
But is she beautiful?

06:39.288 --> 06:40.880
Enough to distract Mr. Polo.

06:42.191 --> 06:43.556
Very well.

06:44.227 --> 06:46.718
You're aware that
the blood of the... those birds

06:46.796 --> 06:48.457
is attracting a school
of sharks.

06:48.531 --> 06:52.058
Well, let's hope that none of
our guests falls overboard.

06:52.268 --> 06:53.394
Pull!

06:57.240 --> 06:58.229
Pull!

07:07.049 --> 07:08.846
Damn waste of birds.

07:10.653 --> 07:13.679
It's the abominable waste
I object to.

07:13.756 --> 07:14.882
Waste?

07:14.957 --> 07:19.394
How can you possibly call a chance
to earn $25,000 in one night "waste"?

07:20.129 --> 07:22.324
It's Higgins' law,
if you will.

07:22.632 --> 07:25.795
Opportunity plus Magnum
equals financial disaster.

07:26.269 --> 07:29.170
Inevitably, the disaster
befalls an innocent bystander.

07:29.238 --> 07:30.466
In this case, Mr. Masters.

07:30.539 --> 07:31.665
Oh, come on, Higgins.

07:31.741 --> 07:35.177
Robin has a whole closet
full of tuxedos in all sizes.

07:35.244 --> 07:36.711
One of them is
bound to fit me.

07:36.779 --> 07:38.770
That wardrobe is
for guests of the estate.

07:38.848 --> 07:41.510
Well, I'm a guest. Sort of.

07:41.784 --> 07:45.379
The "sort of" is more
descriptive of your status here.

07:45.454 --> 07:47.513
Oh, come on, Higgins.
Word of honor.

07:47.590 --> 07:50.753
I promise it'll come back
in perfect condition.

07:51.327 --> 07:55.764
Have you ever considered the absolutely
novel alternative of renting one?

07:57.333 --> 07:58.425
Okay.

07:59.001 --> 08:01.663
Okay, Higgins.
I didn't want to bring this up.

08:01.737 --> 08:04.763
I didn't want to embarrass you.
But it just so happens,

08:04.840 --> 08:08.105
it so happens that today
is my birthday.

08:09.145 --> 08:12.114
Now, I know that you probably
didn't shop for a gift.

08:12.181 --> 08:15.173
So as a favor,
a favor on my birthday,

08:15.251 --> 08:17.583
let me borrow
one of the tuxedos.

08:20.323 --> 08:22.223
Let me understand this.

08:22.291 --> 08:25.454
Today being your birthday,
in lieu of a present,

08:25.661 --> 08:28.892
you want me to loan you
one of the estate tuxedos.

08:29.465 --> 08:30.989
Higgins, you got me a gift!

08:31.067 --> 08:32.693
Good heavens, no.

08:33.135 --> 08:34.625
Then I'll take the tuxedo.

08:34.703 --> 08:35.864
Good.

08:35.938 --> 08:37.405
I'll help you select it.

08:37.472 --> 08:40.669
Higgins, you really did
get me a gift, didn't you?

08:41.110 --> 08:43.703
No, Mr. Masters did.

08:44.447 --> 08:47.314
But since you want to borrow
one of his tuxedos instead,

08:47.383 --> 08:50.181
I will, of course,
be returning the gift.

08:52.321 --> 08:53.879
Returning what?

08:57.293 --> 09:00.387
Higgins, what kind of
a gift is it?

09:03.366 --> 09:05.391
Gentlemen, the game is
five-card draw.

09:05.468 --> 09:07.368
Jacks or better to open.

09:09.138 --> 09:11.834
My late husband, Billy Lowry,
always said,

09:11.907 --> 09:15.536
two of the most exciting things
in life were bringing in a gusher

09:15.611 --> 09:18.045
and drawing to
an inside straight.

09:20.349 --> 09:22.715
To your good fortune,
everybody.

09:30.493 --> 09:31.858
I'll pass.

09:32.661 --> 09:34.060
Pass.

09:34.130 --> 09:36.291
I'll open, uh, for $1,000.

09:40.603 --> 09:41.831
I call.

09:42.438 --> 09:45.566
How can I resist being
in such charming company?

09:49.445 --> 09:50.639
Cards.

09:50.713 --> 09:53.011
I'll have three cards,
my dear.

09:54.250 --> 09:55.444
Three.

09:57.286 --> 09:58.548
And two.

10:02.191 --> 10:03.818
I'll play these.

10:04.293 --> 10:08.229
And the dealer
will take one card.

10:08.297 --> 10:10.094
You know, Mrs. Lowry,

10:10.833 --> 10:13.927
you're about the fastest
dealer I've ever seen.

10:15.771 --> 10:16.999
Really?

10:19.508 --> 10:21.772
The fastest and the luckiest.

10:22.511 --> 10:23.773
Well,

10:23.879 --> 10:27.815
in that case, I'd be honored
to have you deal me my card.

10:32.221 --> 10:33.518
For luck.

10:35.191 --> 10:36.852
Well, may I cut?

10:41.897 --> 10:44.798
Thank you.
Your bet, Mr. Thompson.

10:48.304 --> 10:49.737
$50,000.

10:54.777 --> 10:56.210
That's preposterous.

10:56.278 --> 10:59.736
No, sugar, I think it's just
called high-stakes poker.

11:00.549 --> 11:02.176
Too rich for me.

11:02.785 --> 11:06.619
You know, I feel so lucky,
I won't even look at this last card.

11:07.790 --> 11:09.155
I'll call.

11:12.461 --> 11:13.485
Three aces.

11:13.562 --> 11:14.756
Very nice, but,

11:14.830 --> 11:16.991
let's see what you dealt me.

11:24.673 --> 11:28.165
I must have you deal for me
more often, Mr. Thompson.

11:31.947 --> 11:34.472
Well, I got to
freshen my makeup.

11:34.550 --> 11:36.677
So if you gentlemen
will excuse me,

11:36.752 --> 11:38.947
Mr. Magnum here will play my hand.
What?

11:39.021 --> 11:42.354
And I warn you,
he's a much better player than I am.

11:42.725 --> 11:44.090
Excuse me.

11:44.994 --> 11:46.621
What are you doing?

11:46.695 --> 11:48.686
Just keep raising them.

12:16.725 --> 12:19.523
I want you to come up forward
and give us a hand, okay?

12:19.595 --> 12:20.857
Mr. Thompson said...

12:20.930 --> 12:22.693
I know what your orders are.

12:23.065 --> 12:25.033
Those sharks are
staying with us.

12:25.100 --> 12:27.591
And if those guys come out and see them,
they'll be scared.

12:27.670 --> 12:31.663
And you know how Thompson feels about
taking care of the guests. So let's go.

13:22.073 --> 13:23.762
It's up to you, Chan.

13:27.278 --> 13:28.905
Another $5,000.

13:35.920 --> 13:37.387
Your $5,000

13:39.123 --> 13:41.148
and I'll raise you $5,000.

13:43.861 --> 13:47.854
I've been admiring your most unusual
ring all evening, Mr. Magnum.

13:48.466 --> 13:50.195
May I ask its origin?

13:50.301 --> 13:54.101
Oh, it's a souvenir of a visit
to your part of the worid, sir.

13:54.639 --> 13:56.300
I thought as much.

13:58.442 --> 14:00.034
Another $10,000.

14:10.688 --> 14:12.315
And I'll raise you $20,000.

14:12.390 --> 14:13.789
Have you ever
been to Vietnam?

14:13.858 --> 14:16.554
Several times.
An exquisite country,

14:17.261 --> 14:19.456
despite its recent
transgressions.

14:19.530 --> 14:23.364
Well, I seem to have returned
just at the most exciting moment.

14:23.434 --> 14:25.129
Whose raise is it?

14:25.202 --> 14:26.328
Mine.

14:27.738 --> 14:30.798
But I'm afraid
your friend has outplayed me.

14:32.510 --> 14:34.671
Congratulations, Mr. Magnum.

14:35.880 --> 14:37.313
Thank you.

14:38.549 --> 14:40.540
The way you play,
Thomas, darling.

14:40.618 --> 14:43.280
I think you should hold the cards,
and I'll just bring you luck.

14:43.354 --> 14:45.447
Another drink to celebrate.

14:54.398 --> 14:55.490
Well, uh,

14:55.566 --> 15:00.003
since Mrs. Lowry seems to be enjoying
such remarkable good fortune,

15:00.504 --> 15:03.803
I'd like to propose that
we try to change all that.

15:05.343 --> 15:07.971
Let's double the ante
with every hand.

15:08.913 --> 15:10.141
Agreed.

15:14.885 --> 15:18.013
Mr. Thompson,
I do love the way you deal.

15:19.390 --> 15:21.915
Gentlemen, a rare pleasure.

15:22.293 --> 15:24.727
More than a pleasure,
<i>cara mia.</i>

15:24.795 --> 15:28.162
$300,000 is ecstasy.

15:28.232 --> 15:32.965
Yes. Uh, Mrs. Lowry, if you and your
friend will accompany me to my cabin,

15:33.637 --> 15:37.471
I have to get the money from
my safe to cash in your chips.

15:37.541 --> 15:41.033
Oh, the game's the excitement.
Counting money is such a bore.

15:41.112 --> 15:42.977
Just have your accountant
send me a check.

15:43.047 --> 15:45.811
Well, perhaps it would be more
convenient for him to pay now.

15:45.883 --> 15:48.943
I always settle my debts
on the spot, Mrs. Lowry.

15:49.020 --> 15:50.453
Good policy.

16:00.031 --> 16:01.055
Uh,

16:01.132 --> 16:03.692
could we leave the door open?
It's a little hot in here.

16:03.768 --> 16:05.736
You'll have plenty
of ventilation very soon.

16:05.803 --> 16:07.566
Why, Mr. Thompson,

16:07.638 --> 16:11.005
even in Texas, big losers
don't resort to firepower.

16:11.075 --> 16:13.509
You were in here
and you opened my safe.

16:13.577 --> 16:15.044
I want what you stole.

16:15.112 --> 16:18.206
Now you can give it to me,
or I'll take it from you.

16:18.282 --> 16:21.581
If you don't believe me, for openers,
I will eliminate your partner here.

16:21.652 --> 16:22.744
What's going on here?

16:22.820 --> 16:25.084
I was lookin' for cash,
but I didn't find any.

16:25.156 --> 16:27.386
The story about being
a wealthy widow was a lie.

16:27.458 --> 16:29.016
My husband didn't
leave me a cent.

16:29.093 --> 16:31.721
J.L., he doesn't want
your family history.

16:31.796 --> 16:33.991
Would you please give him what you took.
I'm broke,

16:34.065 --> 16:36.226
except for the money
I put in the pot tonight.

16:36.300 --> 16:38.495
I thought I'd find a bankroll
in your cabin.

16:38.569 --> 16:41.163
J.L., would you
please give it to him?

16:41.772 --> 16:44.502
See? Nothing! Nothing!

16:44.575 --> 16:46.543
Not even car fare home
if you shoot him.

16:48.079 --> 16:49.637
I think he means it.

16:49.713 --> 16:50.941
Then search me.

17:08.265 --> 17:10.699
Hold it! Believe me,
I'll kill you.

17:12.002 --> 17:14.561
Into the closet.
Magnum, get ready to run.

17:14.637 --> 17:16.731
No, wait. We can make a deal.
I'll pay you twice...

17:16.807 --> 17:19.241
Don't tempt me to do
what I'm aching to do already.

17:19.310 --> 17:21.141
Lock 'em in, Magnum.

17:24.748 --> 17:27.239
J.L., the money.
We won it fair and square.

17:27.318 --> 17:28.876
Shouldn't we get the money?

17:29.954 --> 17:32.388
J.L., it's my money, too,
you know.

17:32.456 --> 17:33.582
Shh.

17:37.728 --> 17:39.855
No, it's all right.
We're taking ourselves ashore.

17:39.930 --> 17:41.522
Mr. Thompson said
no one's to leave...

17:41.599 --> 17:43.032
Consider
that order changed.

17:49.507 --> 17:51.134
Get in the boat!

17:53.577 --> 17:55.238
Start the engine.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.307
Give me the gun!

18:08.058 --> 18:09.685
Get in the boat!

18:20.104 --> 18:21.469
Let's lower
the other launch.

18:21.539 --> 18:22.563
No, no.

18:22.640 --> 18:25.666
They're 50 miles from shore.
That launch hasn't been refueled.

18:25.743 --> 18:27.836
We'll get them with the
chopper in the morning.

18:27.912 --> 18:31.006
What I want to know is
how in blazes did they do it?

18:31.081 --> 18:32.605
They had help.

18:32.850 --> 18:34.340
It wasn't me.

18:34.418 --> 18:36.318
I didn't do anything.

18:36.554 --> 18:37.885
Kill him.

18:39.056 --> 18:40.353
No!

18:56.373 --> 18:59.274
Wipe those appalling smiles
off your faces.

19:00.211 --> 19:03.874
Magnum
and Mr. Masters' tuxedo

19:04.415 --> 19:06.975
have not as yet returned.

19:07.251 --> 19:11.585
Higgins, don't you know that a
high-stake poker game can go all night?

19:14.058 --> 19:17.391
Yeah, that Texas gal
is racking up a big score.

19:17.461 --> 19:19.691
And Magnum's in
for 10 percent.

19:20.097 --> 19:23.123
I wish your childlike
enthusiasm were merited,

19:23.200 --> 19:25.725
but my prediction is
that they lost everything.

19:25.803 --> 19:28.294
And Magnum, after seeking
solace in a bottle,

19:28.372 --> 19:30.670
is too intoxicated
to show his face.

19:30.741 --> 19:31.867
Mmm-mmm.

19:32.076 --> 19:35.170
My gambler's instinct says
that J.L. Is a big winner.

19:35.246 --> 19:37.077
And my instinct
is never wrong.

19:37.147 --> 19:38.637
The boy is right.

19:38.716 --> 19:41.082
Wherever those two are,
they're loaded with dough.

19:41.151 --> 19:42.379
And one thing is for sure.

19:42.453 --> 19:45.183
They're having
one terrific time.

19:58.469 --> 20:00.027
J.L., will you stop fooling

20:00.104 --> 20:01.571
with the emergency
transmitter?

20:01.639 --> 20:03.163
Just checking.

20:03.974 --> 20:07.307
I want us to be prepared
if the Coast Guard flies over.

20:07.378 --> 20:10.211
Do you want some water?
You look awfully...

20:11.782 --> 20:14.273
You're right. I am steaming.

20:14.985 --> 20:16.418
Boiling, in fact.

20:16.487 --> 20:17.920
But it's not because
of the sun.

20:17.988 --> 20:19.512
Shoot, it looks like
it's gonna rain.

20:19.590 --> 20:21.251
It's over being played
as a sucker.

20:21.325 --> 20:23.452
All dressed up in a tuxedo,

20:23.527 --> 20:27.463
and... and instead of getting a rose in
my lapel, I get a.38 stuck in my ribs!

20:27.531 --> 20:29.931
Well, why do you think
I hired you?

20:30.000 --> 20:33.094
I warned you in the beginning
Thompson was a killer snake.

20:33.170 --> 20:34.569
"A killer snake"?

20:34.638 --> 20:38.074
I'd be a little upset, too,
if somebody went through my safe.

20:38.142 --> 20:41.236
I explained that.
I'm desperate for money.

20:41.312 --> 20:44.975
Desperate? So desperate that
when we strolled out of there,

20:45.049 --> 20:48.246
you didn't want to take
the $300,000 that we won?

20:48.585 --> 20:52.749
I may be crazy from the heat,
but I'm not balmy enough to buy that.

20:52.823 --> 20:55.121
Well, maybe
I'm just a dizzy female

20:55.192 --> 20:58.127
who got her priorities
mixed up in the panic.

20:59.296 --> 21:00.923
Oh, I doubt that.

21:01.799 --> 21:03.323
Here, get busy.

21:04.601 --> 21:06.501
Because until
you level with me,

21:06.570 --> 21:10.028
I am just going to sit here and
recover from heat exhaustion.

21:10.107 --> 21:12.007
But Thompson's got to be
searching for us.

21:12.076 --> 21:15.705
If you don't paddle,
we're not going to reach that island.

21:19.049 --> 21:21.017
You can't intimidate me.

21:25.289 --> 21:27.189
You can't bully me
into submission.

21:27.257 --> 21:28.554
I don't have to.

21:28.625 --> 21:31.719
I'm sure Thompson would be
delighted to do that.

21:35.366 --> 21:39.530
Besides, in a pinch, I can
always swim to that island.

21:42.239 --> 21:44.366
Okay. Okay.

21:45.008 --> 21:47.476
Score this round
for intimidation.

21:48.579 --> 21:52.879
I didn't go after the money because
I happen to be on assignment

21:52.950 --> 21:55.111
as a government agent.

22:07.046 --> 22:10.277
K- Bay, this is
Coast Guard Hilo, Number 1420.

22:10.349 --> 22:12.317
We got nothing down
here but empty water.

22:12.384 --> 22:15.182
Request proceed to
next search area. Over.

22:15.254 --> 22:17.085
Affirmative, Number 1420.

22:19.758 --> 22:21.623
Okay, let's take
a heading of 15 degrees.

22:21.694 --> 22:22.626
Right.

22:22.695 --> 22:24.788
Maybe we'll find something.

22:24.864 --> 22:27.196
Wait a minute.
What's that over there?

22:27.266 --> 22:29.325
K- Bay, got something
at 11 o'clock.

22:29.401 --> 22:31.426
I'm heading down
for a look. Over.

22:31.503 --> 22:33.471
Roger. Standing by.

22:38.310 --> 22:40.540
well, now Thomas is probably
having such a good time,

22:40.613 --> 22:42.513
he probably forgot
to come home, right?

22:42.581 --> 22:43.707
Right.

22:45.517 --> 22:49.180
He's probably someplace right now,
blind drunk, celebrating, right?

22:49.755 --> 22:50.949
Right.

22:53.359 --> 22:57.056
Gentlemen, that was
the Coast Guard calling.

22:58.430 --> 23:01.228
Mr. Thompson, on whose yacht
the game took place,

23:01.300 --> 23:04.963
has reported that Magnum and Mrs. Lowry,
against his advice,

23:05.037 --> 23:08.029
insisted on returning to shore
alone in a small motor launch.

23:08.741 --> 23:10.732
It seems they were
quite intoxicated.

23:10.809 --> 23:13.471
Yeah, but even so,
Magnum's one heck of a sailor.

23:14.680 --> 23:17.308
Just like I said. He was drunk,
but he's on his way home.

23:17.383 --> 23:21.114
Mr. Thompson didn't notify the Coast
Guard. It was the other way around.

23:21.887 --> 23:26.586
Debris from the motor launch has been
sighted seven miles off the North Shore.

23:27.326 --> 23:31.194
It seems the boat exploded
and sank with no survivors.

23:44.877 --> 23:46.777
I've got to get back
and refuel.

23:46.845 --> 23:48.540
Can't we stretch it
a little longer?

23:48.614 --> 23:51.174
Only if you don't mind having
to swim back to Honolulu.

23:51.250 --> 23:52.877
We'll get back out
as soon as I refuel.

23:52.952 --> 23:55.250
What if the Coast Guard
keeps on searchin'?

23:55.321 --> 23:58.757
Let 'em. I planted that wreckage 100
miles out in the wrong direction.

23:58.824 --> 24:01.156
Don't worry, Mr. Thompson.
You pay me to do this.

24:01.226 --> 24:03.126
Find 'em now
or in a couple of hours,

24:03.195 --> 24:04.890
really isn't gonna
make any difference.

24:09.802 --> 24:12.965
A ship or a plane

24:13.806 --> 24:15.296
could appear at any moment.

24:15.374 --> 24:17.842
And I want to get this
transmitter as high as possible.

24:17.910 --> 24:19.810
Magnum, I'm aware.

24:20.245 --> 24:23.544
I am fully and painfully

24:24.416 --> 24:26.350
aware of our dilemma.

24:26.618 --> 24:30.850
All I'm suggesting is just
a moment's moderation

24:31.457 --> 24:33.687
in our sprint up this hill.

24:35.494 --> 24:39.328
In fact, as the person
in charge of this operation,

24:39.398 --> 24:41.730
I should be setting up
the transmitter myself.

24:41.800 --> 24:44.030
In charge?
In charge of what?

24:44.103 --> 24:47.129
I happen to
be a trained agent,

24:47.206 --> 24:49.640
skilled in
all manner of survival.

24:49.708 --> 24:53.576
Now I didn't want to have to say this
to you, Mag, but since you've forced me.

24:53.645 --> 24:57.479
It is my duty to get us out of
the mess you've landed us in.

24:58.450 --> 25:00.850
I got us in? I got us...

25:01.086 --> 25:03.748
I'm just the bodyguard
in the tuxedo, remember?

25:03.822 --> 25:06.985
You're the one who blew your mission
on the boat and turned Thompson on us.

25:07.059 --> 25:11.792
Who steered us out of any sea
lane onto this godforsaken island?

25:11.864 --> 25:13.491
Who stranded us?

25:14.066 --> 25:16.660
We'll talk about that at the top,
if you can make it.

25:16.735 --> 25:18.566
Oh, well,

25:18.971 --> 25:21.735
anytime you want
to switch outfits,

25:21.807 --> 25:24.002
I'd love to race you,

25:25.344 --> 25:28.006
and give you
an hour's head start!

25:32.151 --> 25:33.379
Enough!

25:34.119 --> 25:35.347
I've had it.

25:35.421 --> 25:37.946
I've had it with your
complaints and your orders,

25:38.023 --> 25:40.821
and your commands, especially
from someone who can't keep up.

25:40.893 --> 25:42.622
I can kill men
with these hands.

25:42.694 --> 25:46.027
Why bother, when you can
destroy them with that mouth?

25:46.098 --> 25:47.087
Stop!

25:48.300 --> 25:49.358
Now hold still.

25:49.435 --> 25:52.302
This dress
cost the agency $5,000,

25:52.504 --> 25:53.766
and I'm responsible...

25:53.839 --> 25:54.965
Terrific.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.803
When we get back,
if we get back,

25:56.875 --> 26:00.572
you can tell the agency that
you now have a $5,000 miniskirt.

26:01.013 --> 26:04.608
Whoever your agency
or section or bureau may be.

26:04.683 --> 26:06.878
I already told you,

26:06.952 --> 26:09.477
four times by my count,

26:09.822 --> 26:13.087
you've got no clearance for that
information, no need to know.

26:13.158 --> 26:16.753
Surely they must have taught
you that in Naval Intelligence.

26:16.829 --> 26:19.923
"No need to know," huh?
"No need to know"?

26:19.998 --> 26:23.161
Well, I'll tell you something
else I have no need for.

26:23.235 --> 26:24.896
Carrying this transmitter.

26:24.970 --> 26:27.905
Now, you pick it up
for a while, commander.

26:35.914 --> 26:37.245
Oh!

26:37.483 --> 26:40.145
You know what you are,
Thomas Magnum?

26:40.686 --> 26:42.984
"To the best friend
a guy could have" was,

26:43.055 --> 26:45.853
I believe, the last toast
to the deceased.

26:46.225 --> 26:48.989
However, I don't believe it
for an instant.

26:49.828 --> 26:51.261
Hey, Higgins,

26:51.330 --> 26:53.958
you can't insult my buddy
with him not being here.

26:54.032 --> 26:57.763
Please do not splash cheap rye
whiskey on Mr. Masters' sofa.

27:00.205 --> 27:02.139
He was a hell of a guy.

27:02.741 --> 27:04.333
A hell of a guy.

27:05.777 --> 27:08.507
Maybe not much
of a sailor but...

27:10.449 --> 27:12.883
I've contemplated
Magnum's death.

27:14.753 --> 27:16.778
Theoretically, of course,

27:16.855 --> 27:20.757
given the almost inevitable
consequences of his sordid occupation.

27:21.226 --> 27:24.923
And I know, however
desolated I would be,

27:25.697 --> 27:28.131
I would also experience
a certain...

27:28.967 --> 27:32.300
a certain catharsis
that is singularly missing.

27:32.804 --> 27:33.930
Uh,

27:34.006 --> 27:37.874
run that by me again, Higgie baby,
only this time in English.

27:38.177 --> 27:40.441
I don't believe
Magnum's dead.

27:44.316 --> 27:46.443
You mean, our buddy's alive?

27:48.387 --> 27:49.820
Our buddy is alive?

27:49.888 --> 27:50.980
Yes.

27:51.623 --> 27:54.421
And I propose
we organize a search.

27:54.993 --> 27:56.927
Not unlike
The Battle of El Alamein,

27:56.995 --> 28:00.863
victory will turn on strong
leadership and supreme organization.

28:00.933 --> 28:02.901
Modestly, albeit reluctantly,

28:02.968 --> 28:05.459
I, of course, will assume
the mantle of command.

28:05.537 --> 28:06.902
Hear, hear.

28:07.539 --> 28:09.336
Wait a minute.
Just a minute.

28:10.342 --> 28:14.904
Who appointed you
commander-in-chief?

28:24.256 --> 28:25.985
There being
no further objection,

28:26.058 --> 28:28.492
the motion is
carried unanimously.

28:48.447 --> 28:50.608
I have built
the signal fire,

28:50.682 --> 28:52.479
I've carried everything
up from the boat,

28:52.551 --> 28:55.486
and that's enough wood
to last us for days. Now...

28:57.122 --> 28:59.317
Now may I have
some dinner, please?

28:59.391 --> 29:02.224
You had your choice,
an equal division of labor.

29:02.294 --> 29:04.660
You could have caught the fish
and cooked it,

29:04.730 --> 29:06.288
a trained survivor like you.

29:06.365 --> 29:09.766
I meant a city survivor.
Just ask me to...

29:10.502 --> 29:13.869
to find a cab on Fifth Avenue
at rush hour,

29:14.106 --> 29:17.303
or infiltrate the best resort
hotel on three continents

29:17.376 --> 29:19.901
in four languages,
and I'm dynamite.

29:20.178 --> 29:23.944
I just never planned on being
stranded without room service.

29:25.050 --> 29:26.745
If that's an apology,
then I accept.

29:26.818 --> 29:28.308
An apology?

29:28.720 --> 29:30.984
It's... it's maybe
a peace overture.

29:31.056 --> 29:32.853
Is that almost done?

29:33.892 --> 29:36.861
Well, then I accept,
and it is, but...

29:38.864 --> 29:39.853
Mmm.

29:39.931 --> 29:41.728
Be careful, it's hot.

29:45.070 --> 29:47.630
Just hold still
for a minute, will you?

29:47.939 --> 29:48.906
Don't...

29:48.974 --> 29:50.874
I told you it was hot.

29:56.915 --> 29:58.610
Give me your hand.

29:59.584 --> 30:01.051
This may sting
a little bit.

30:01.119 --> 30:02.984
Don't worry, I'm tough.

30:06.792 --> 30:07.884
Ouch!

30:16.668 --> 30:18.363
Tell me something.

30:19.871 --> 30:21.498
Why'd you hire me?

30:21.573 --> 30:23.632
Why didn't the agency
send in a number two?

30:23.709 --> 30:25.939
And don't tell me,
"It's because they didn't have anybody

30:26.011 --> 30:28.070
who looked good in a tux."

30:31.016 --> 30:32.608
Eight days ago,

30:32.684 --> 30:36.211
my partner was killed at
International Airport in Miami.

30:36.655 --> 30:38.418
His throat was cut.

30:38.490 --> 30:40.651
We figured he'd gotten
the microfilm,

30:40.726 --> 30:44.423
but they murdered him before he
could make contact with the agency.

30:45.030 --> 30:46.622
What I don't get

30:47.632 --> 30:52.501
is if Uncle Sam knows what Thompson's
doing, why don't you just...

30:52.637 --> 30:53.763
Close him down?

30:53.839 --> 30:54.828
Yeah.

30:54.906 --> 30:58.808
When you're dealing with the
man who owns, owns mind you,

30:59.144 --> 31:01.135
the fifth-largest
defense supplier

31:01.213 --> 31:03.147
in the country,
you need proof.

31:03.215 --> 31:05.046
That's the microfilm.

31:05.417 --> 31:07.044
Who's the buyer?

31:07.285 --> 31:09.185
The Oriental in the card game.

31:09.488 --> 31:11.388
He's a Chinese general.

31:12.657 --> 31:13.783
Done.

31:14.960 --> 31:19.158
Thompson, uh, auctioned the
microfilm to him for $10 million.

31:19.831 --> 31:23.323
Plans for a, critical part
of our STEALTH technology.

31:24.636 --> 31:27.434
I guess, uh,
gambling losses add up,

31:27.506 --> 31:30.236
even when you're
the fifth-largest, uh...

31:30.542 --> 31:31.736
Um...

31:41.853 --> 31:45.084
So Thompson's deal with
the Chinese is exclusivity.

31:45.390 --> 31:47.984
And until they got
the microfilm back,

31:48.960 --> 31:50.427
or kill us...

31:52.431 --> 31:54.899
Where is that microfilm,
by the way?

31:55.834 --> 31:56.858
Mmm,

31:57.569 --> 31:59.901
Thomas, you're
a wonderful cook.

32:00.272 --> 32:01.864
And actually you're...

32:03.341 --> 32:05.309
you're a wonderful hero.

32:05.911 --> 32:09.142
When the bullets
were flying on the yacht,

32:10.816 --> 32:15.344
I felt the kind of
rush of blood pumping

32:16.855 --> 32:18.584
I've only had,

32:20.091 --> 32:21.388
well,

32:21.460 --> 32:24.725
when the cards are

32:26.431 --> 32:27.420
just,

32:28.467 --> 32:29.832
just...

32:39.311 --> 32:42.803
Are you still mad about your
10 percent of the $300,000?

32:44.216 --> 32:46.116
Where's the microfilm?

32:48.153 --> 32:49.552
On the boat.

32:52.491 --> 32:55.927
I hid it there when I realized
Thompson suspected me.

33:00.799 --> 33:02.494
Are you satisfied?

33:06.771 --> 33:07.965
Uh-huh.

33:54.786 --> 33:56.720
It's a chopper.
I think it's the Coast Guard.

33:56.788 --> 33:57.446
I'll light the signal.

33:57.471 --> 33:59.348
No, t-they won't see it
from that direction.

33:59.373 --> 34:00.637
The transmitter
will bring it in.

34:01.964 --> 34:03.989
Wait. No!

34:04.014 --> 34:06.244
They're heading
the other way!

34:20.195 --> 34:21.661
Is it broken?

34:22.530 --> 34:25.556
It isn't set to the
international rescue frequency.

34:25.632 --> 34:26.998
Set it to 121.5 MHz.

34:27.068 --> 34:30.231
The tuner's jammed.
I can't change the frequency.

34:30.705 --> 34:32.002
It doesn't make sense.

34:32.072 --> 34:34.940
God only knows
what Thompson's got that...

34:36.177 --> 34:39.976
You don't suppose he's got it
set to a frequency on the yacht?

34:43.685 --> 34:47.313
If it is, it means we've been
signaling him all this time.

34:54.496 --> 34:57.829
The Hawaiian Islands are
actually hundreds of islands.

34:57.899 --> 35:01.426
Some of them are so small that they're
covered by the ocean at high tide.

35:01.503 --> 35:04.666
Higgins, Higgins, enough of
the tour-guide chatter, man.

35:04.739 --> 35:05.831
Just look.

35:05.907 --> 35:07.807
I don't know why
we are looking here anyway.

35:07.876 --> 35:11.039
The Coast Guard said they found the
wreckage off the North Shore of Oahu.

35:11.112 --> 35:12.443
Yeah, but according to my map,

35:12.514 --> 35:14.846
that's exactly
where it shouldn't be.

35:15.350 --> 35:18.478
We're proceeding on the assumption
that this rotter Thompson

35:18.553 --> 35:21.613
gave the Coast Guard
totally false information.

35:21.923 --> 35:25.120
In which case, according
to winds, currents, and tides,

35:25.193 --> 35:27.787
Magnum should be
somewhere out here.

35:27.862 --> 35:30.296
Of course, Thompson could be
such a blackguard

35:30.365 --> 35:33.766
that he told the truth assuming
we'd think he was lying.

35:33.835 --> 35:35.962
I remember a case
in North Africa

35:36.037 --> 35:39.871
when we took an SS officer
prisoner just after Tobruk.

35:40.375 --> 35:44.311
Well, you can imagine
our fierce determination
to discover Rommel's plans.

35:44.746 --> 35:47.408
They worked on him
for a week. Nothing.

35:47.482 --> 35:50.246
Then they brought me in to...

36:12.607 --> 36:13.938
I'm sorry, Thomas.

36:14.008 --> 36:17.034
No. You were only
doing your job.

36:19.147 --> 36:22.605
I'm sometimes melancholy
about this work.

36:23.651 --> 36:25.016
This life.

36:25.587 --> 36:28.852
When I started out, things were
all in crisp black and white.

36:28.923 --> 36:30.288
And now...

36:31.626 --> 36:32.991
I'm sorry.

36:34.028 --> 36:36.519
Would you believe me
if I told you...

36:38.633 --> 36:41.033
It's coming back.
The signal fire.

37:08.396 --> 37:09.556
Magnum.

37:09.631 --> 37:12.122
When it blazes, throw some
weeds on it for smoke.

37:12.200 --> 37:13.724
Stop right now.

37:14.535 --> 37:15.797
Please.

37:16.671 --> 37:18.002
Don't make me.

37:18.072 --> 37:20.006
What, are you crazy?

37:21.342 --> 37:23.037
You lied.
You lied to me.

37:23.111 --> 37:24.544
I said I was an agent.

37:24.612 --> 37:26.842
I just didn't say
what country.

37:28.917 --> 37:30.179
Russian?

37:30.785 --> 37:32.685
Don't light that fire.

37:33.955 --> 37:35.923
You reset the transmitter.

37:35.990 --> 37:37.548
You broke the knob.

37:37.792 --> 37:41.421
It's set for one of our subs.
It's on its way.

37:42.330 --> 37:44.628
Thomas, you can hide.

37:44.933 --> 37:47.265
When they pick me up,
I'll tell them you were killed.

37:47.335 --> 37:50.566
And then, when I'm safe,
I'll call the Coast Guard. Don't...

37:50.638 --> 37:53.300
Don't look at me that way.

37:54.342 --> 37:56.003
I don't believe you.

37:56.077 --> 37:57.442
It's true.

37:58.413 --> 37:59.675
I wish...

38:00.481 --> 38:02.346
I wish it were different.

38:02.417 --> 38:03.441
No.

38:05.019 --> 38:07.283
I don't believe you'll shoot.

38:25.338 --> 38:26.828
What do you make of that?

38:26.906 --> 38:28.339
I don't see nothing.

38:28.408 --> 38:31.969
Precisely why I had the foresight
to bring the binoculars.

38:33.146 --> 38:36.206
Hey, I see smoke.
T.C., that's a signal fire.

38:38.485 --> 38:39.782
Come on.

38:55.668 --> 38:57.101
Come on, T.C.

39:01.541 --> 39:03.065
Boy, am I glad to see you.

39:03.143 --> 39:04.633
It's mutual, buddy.

39:04.711 --> 39:07.077
Oh, my God,
the bloody tuxedo.

39:07.147 --> 39:10.116
Magnum, get your head down or
you're going to get it blown off.

39:32.872 --> 39:35.102
Come on, baby,
you can do it.

39:51.858 --> 39:54.053
Now this dress
is really ruined.

39:54.127 --> 39:56.459
Don't worry, J.L.
It's not bad.

39:56.529 --> 39:58.224
You're going to be
all right.

39:58.298 --> 39:59.925
If you can
get us out of here.

39:59.999 --> 40:01.694
I'm trying, baby!
I'm trying.

40:08.341 --> 40:10.536
Come on, T.C., what are you
holding back for?

40:10.610 --> 40:12.043
I ain't holding back.

40:12.111 --> 40:13.601
We got five people
holding us back.

40:13.680 --> 40:16.513
You want to outrun this cat,
someone's gotta get out and walk.

40:49.082 --> 40:50.276
Can you get above 'em?

40:50.350 --> 40:51.578
You got it, baby.

41:58.484 --> 42:01.783
The hospital will be
discharging her in the morning.

42:02.255 --> 42:04.280
What are you going to do?

42:06.192 --> 42:07.659
I don't know.

42:10.663 --> 42:12.255
She is a Russian spy.

42:12.332 --> 42:13.526
I know.

42:21.474 --> 42:22.998
But Thompson's dead.

42:23.076 --> 42:25.203
The security leak's closed.

42:27.714 --> 42:29.773
She's still a Russian spy.

42:33.987 --> 42:36.421
She could have
killed me out there,

42:37.657 --> 42:40.125
got away on a sub,
but she didn't.

42:42.729 --> 42:44.594
She's still a Russian spy.

42:44.664 --> 42:46.256
Higgins, I know.

42:46.966 --> 42:48.627
But what's the harm
in letting her go?

42:48.701 --> 42:50.828
She doesn't have
the microfilm.

42:50.903 --> 42:52.063
Magnum,

42:52.372 --> 42:54.567
stealing STEALTH secrets

42:54.641 --> 42:59.135
is hardly the same thing as pinching
lipstick from the local five-and-dime.

44:33.740 --> 44:35.571
I was born in Russia,

44:35.641 --> 44:38.701
in what was left of Stalingrad,
right after the war.

44:38.778 --> 44:42.339
Part of what I told you about
Texas Lightning was true.

44:43.116 --> 44:47.382
My father was sent to Houston on a
diplomatic mission when I was five.

44:47.553 --> 44:50.818
I remember, because I'd never
had ice cream before.

44:51.090 --> 44:54.457
I lived there until I went
back to Moscow to college.

44:55.394 --> 44:57.021
I met Billy Lowry

44:57.897 --> 45:02.163
at a diplomatic reception in Houston
when I was visiting old friends.

45:04.804 --> 45:06.271
Were you already an agent?

45:06.339 --> 45:09.035
When I married him? Yes.

45:09.675 --> 45:11.973
But it never mattered until...

45:23.022 --> 45:25.855
The latest in
spring accessories.

45:26.492 --> 45:28.255
I hope you like it.

45:29.362 --> 45:30.920
You look terrific.

45:30.997 --> 45:34.091
I wanted to look my best
for whoever's waiting.

45:34.667 --> 45:36.601
Who is waiting, Thomas?

45:36.936 --> 45:40.895
Naval Intelligence?
The FBI? The CIA?

45:42.041 --> 45:43.372
The agency?

45:45.311 --> 45:47.211
Or do I need to know?

45:48.447 --> 45:49.675
Nobody.

46:00.426 --> 46:02.553
I'm giving you a head start.

46:04.730 --> 46:07.494
This isn't the way
it's supposed to end.

46:08.968 --> 46:11.436
I could finish this
and meet you

46:12.338 --> 46:14.397
in Europe next year,
in Switzerland.

46:14.473 --> 46:16.998
Or we could just run,
now, together.

46:19.212 --> 46:21.146
There's just one thing.

46:22.982 --> 46:25.815
The microfilm.
You've got to give it to me.

46:28.588 --> 46:31.182
I don't know where it is.

46:44.337 --> 46:45.998
Don't forget this.

46:51.210 --> 46:52.939
You better get going,

46:53.579 --> 46:56.309
or you won't be able to
make your plane.

47:35.688 --> 47:39.556
Mr. Magnum,
I'm so glad I caught you.

47:39.825 --> 47:41.850
I have something for you.

47:43.162 --> 47:45.824
Mrs. Lowry asked me
to give it to you.

47:46.866 --> 47:47.890
When?

47:47.967 --> 47:49.127
This morning.

47:49.201 --> 47:52.932
I walked into her room and she had
it all apart, in pieces, on her bed.

47:53.139 --> 47:54.663
She asked me
to give it to you

47:54.740 --> 47:57.174
only if you
didn't leave with her.

47:57.243 --> 47:58.938
Do you understand?

48:04.817 --> 48:07.650
<i>J.L. Knew I'd found the microfilm.</i>

48:07.753 --> 48:10.278
<i>But she was waiting</i>
<i>for me to tell her.</i>

48:10.356 --> 48:11.482
<i>And me?</i>

48:11.557 --> 48:14.458
<i>I was waiting for her</i>
<i>to tell me she had it.</i>

48:14.627 --> 48:17.619
<i>Both of us wanting</i>
<i>to believe in the other,</i>

48:18.130 --> 48:20.155
<i>but both demanding proof.</i>

48:21.033 --> 48:25.265
<i>And that, as they say,</i>
<i>is the hell of it.</i>
