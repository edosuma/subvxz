06:38.000 --> 06:40.590
Yes, Sir Robert, I had
the child conveyed here.

06:40.631 --> 06:41.760
You know me?

06:41.860 --> 06:45.380
You accompanied my patrol on
your visit to Wapping last year, sir.

06:45.420 --> 06:50.535
And you insisted that this... object
be examined by Sir William Chester,

06:50.575 --> 06:53.033
the leading surgeon in the land,
not the Surrey coroner. Why?

06:53.239 --> 06:55.300
- I'm sorry if I've...
- Answer the question.

06:55.340 --> 06:56.941
I've seen murder before, sir,

06:57.051 --> 07:00.100
but nothing like this.

07:00.140 --> 07:04.780
Murder? How do you murder something
that has never been alive?

07:04.820 --> 07:07.500
Never, sir? Are you certain?

you were acting undercover

You don't know the meaning of fear,
he says.

- Every living creature knows fear, sir.
- Let me tell you mine, then.

08:47.580 --> 08:49.620
Sir William Chester and I

08:49.660 --> 08:53.660
are in the process of modernising
our antiquated medical profession.

08:53.700 --> 08:56.740
The Anatomy Act will ensure
that medicine in this country

08:56.780 --> 09:00.180
is practised only by qualified
and accredited professionals.

09:00.220 --> 09:02.860

09:06.780 --> 09:09.940
is the work of someone
trying to put a stop to it.

- Who, sir?
- Any one of the numberless charlatans

09:13.107 --> 09:14.820
who have profited from the system
as it is.

09:14.860 --> 09:16.980

09:17.020 --> 09:19.940
Apothecaries, witch doctors.
Barbers, body snatchers.

09:19.980 --> 09:23.100
One or more of them is evidently
seeking to discredit our surgeons

09:23.140 --> 09:25.460
by stirring up popular feeling
against them.

09:26.380 --> 09:27.831
You think it was placed there deliberately?

09:27.871 --> 09:29.260
You saw that thing.

09:29.300 --> 09:33.300
A grotesque parody
of surgical procedure.

09:33.340 --> 09:36.060

09:36.100 --> 09:38.060

the one you were
doing business with,

12:09.400 --> 12:11.720
- who is he?
- Pretty. Resurrectionist.

12:11.760 --> 12:13.360
Body snatcher.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.920
He gets his corpses from the anatomy
classes. Subjects, we call them.

12:17.980 --> 12:19.720
I thought the gallows supplied them.

12:19.760 --> 12:21.440
Not the amount that we get through.

12:21.480 --> 12:25.400
- So the hospitals do trade with criminals?
- They ain't criminals.

12:25.440 --> 12:26.220
Look it up.

12:26.261 --> 12:29.480
A dead body ain't property by law.

12:29.520 --> 12:32.760
Right, so if something ain't got an
owner, it can't be stolen, can it?

12:32.800 --> 12:36.360
- Does he bring in children?
- Not often. Hard to come by.

12:36.400 --> 12:39.160
Families keep a closer watch on them
when they go.

12:39.200 --> 12:42.479
- So seven in one go?
- No chance. In a year, if you're lucky.

12:42.580 --> 12:44.900
How much?
For a child?

12:44.940 --> 12:46.620
Depends.

12:46.660 --> 12:48.900
State of decay, time of year.

12:48.940 --> 12:50.700
Five guineas, maybe.

12:50.740 --> 12:53.460
- Good business.
- Oh, yeah, it's a seller's market.

12:53.500 --> 12:57.260
The prices have dropped since talk of them
bringing the workhouse stiffs our way.

12:57.300 --> 13:00.060
- Sold by whom?
- Your employer.

13:00.100 --> 13:01.900
And mine.

13:01.940 --> 13:03.780
But what do I know?

13:03.820 --> 13:06.060
I'm just a hospital porter.

13:14.740 --> 13:16.380
You cut her up, sir?

13:16.420 --> 13:19.540
Into its original constituents, yes.

13:19.760 --> 13:23.100
Eight. One more
than my first testament.

13:24.940 --> 13:26.580
Can you say how they...

13:26.620 --> 13:27.940
how they died?

13:27.980 --> 13:29.900
Not now, no. When, perhaps.

13:30.340 --> 13:32.780
More than a week,
less than a fortnight,

13:32.820 --> 13:35.100
given the state of putrefaction.

13:35.140 --> 13:38.900
- And how long in the water?
- An hour. Two, at most.

13:38.940 --> 13:41.980
- Or longer, I'd wager.
- On what grounds?

13:43.580 --> 13:45.700
I've seen my share of floaters, sir.

13:46.580 --> 13:49.180
An hour here or there
is of little consequence.

13:49.220 --> 13:51.580
Sir Robert gave you his theory?

13:52.540 --> 13:55.580
Yes, someone out to prevent
the anatomy act.

13:55.620 --> 13:57.420
Blacken the name of surgery, yes.

13:57.460 --> 14:00.140
Many people fear us.

14:00.180 --> 14:03.540
They're superstitious about what
happens to their bodies after death.

14:03.580 --> 14:07.580
Medical science has grown
beyond their comprehension.

14:07.620 --> 14:11.680
Isn't it possible for a surgeon
to lose his wits like any other man?

14:11.720 --> 14:14.960
His wits, yes. Not his heart.
Not like this.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.420
This is the work
of a barber or a butcher.

14:18.460 --> 14:22.500
But not one of us, as whoever did
this would have us believe.

14:23.780 --> 14:27.340
- And the stitching?
- A seamstress may stitch.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.060
So you agree with Sir Robert?

14:30.060 --> 14:32.460
What other explanation
could there be?

14:34.500 --> 14:36.780
Look, will you excuse me?
I have a lecture.

14:38.940 --> 14:40.940
Show Mr Marlott out when he's done.

14:41.460 --> 14:44.260

- Move?

Like a chicken
whose head has been cut off,

14:46.940 --> 14:49.040
the energy persisting beyond death?

14:49.080 --> 14:50.760
No, Mr Marlott, they're dead.

15:26.460 --> 15:28.220
May we know why?

15:28.260 --> 15:33.340
I'm afraid not. The Home Secretary
has bound me in strictest confidence.

15:33.380 --> 15:36.700
If it's missing children you want,
go to a window and throw a coin.

Constable Nightingale?

19:43.100 --> 19:45.540
Why was Forrester reprimanding you?

19:45.580 --> 19:47.540
For arresting someone.

19:48.780 --> 19:51.340
- Who?
- Market trader.

19:51.380 --> 19:53.060
Beat up his wife.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.180
That's not a crime
in Forrester's eyes?

19:55.220 --> 19:58.980
Well, not if she can't pay
to have him prosecuted, no.

- Can you?
- I don't have that money.

Good intention but impractical.

GIRL: ♪ Oranges and lemons
say the bells of Saint Clement's ♪

41:12.640 --> 41:14.960
- "That's all we have of her."
- "I understand."

41:15.000 --> 41:16.880
"How could you?"

41:16.920 --> 41:19.000
"I know what it is to grieve."

42:50.680 --> 42:52.640
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC)

43:02.360 --> 43:04.120
Gone.

43:04.160 --> 43:06.000
Just as I thought.

43:09.800 --> 43:12.800
- Look around.
- What for, sir?

43:12.840 --> 43:15.960
Anything that might tell us
of their whereabouts.

43:17.760 --> 43:19.880
And the miniature of the Evans girl.

43:49.720 --> 43:51.920
READS: "Sleeping Lyca lay.

43:53.880 --> 43:56.080
While the beasts of prey.

43:56.120 --> 43:58.720
Come from caverns deep.

43:58.760 --> 44:01.880
View'd the maid asleep."

44:04.209 --> 44:06.061
Lyca.

44:08.651 --> 44:10.052
Lyca.

44:32.040 --> 44:35.280
Nothing, sir. What's that?

44:36.720 --> 44:39.000
Lyca.

44:39.040 --> 44:41.440
The little girl lost.

44:41.480 --> 44:44.680
In a rose pink dress.

44:44.720 --> 44:48.000
Like Alice.

45:40.480 --> 45:42.600
I have business with William Blake.

45:42.640 --> 45:45.480
I'm looking for a girl named Alice.

45:45.520 --> 45:48.560
To find her,

45:48.600 --> 45:50.280
you have to know

45:50.320 --> 45:52.000
the truth of the beast.

45:53.080 --> 45:56.160
I sense you are an honest man.

45:56.200 --> 45:58.040
I believe you are in peril.

46:00.880 --> 46:03.320
A dead body ain't property.

46:03.360 --> 46:05.440
And taking one ain't theft.

46:06.200 --> 46:10.400
Any more from you and I swear
on my soul, you'll swing for it.

46:10.440 --> 46:12.440
I take the liberty
of giving you my address.

46:13.880 --> 46:17.320
This government seeks to make
poverty a crime!

46:17.360 --> 46:20.200
And the afterlife
a privilege of the wealthy!

46:20.240 --> 46:23.400
These are dangerous paths
you're treading, Mr Marlott.

46:23.440 --> 46:27.400
Fail and I promise
I will deny all knowledge of you.

46:27.440 --> 46:32.120
If we deny Christ to the poor,
don't we also deny Him to ourselves?

46:32.160 --> 46:33.920
And that's what is at stake here.

46:33.960 --> 46:35.660
Not merely the future of medicine,

46:35.701 --> 46:39.021
but the prospect of
a world without God.
