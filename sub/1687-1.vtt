WEBVTT

00:48.920 --> 00:50.400
Honey? Hmm?

00:50.600 --> 00:51.795
Have you seen my checkbook?

00:52.800 --> 00:54.678
Downstairs in the living room.

01:16.080 --> 01:18.151
Shh.

01:20.640 --> 01:22.199
Darling, are you okay?

01:24.760 --> 01:25.760
Fine!

01:25.840 --> 01:27.593
Are you sure?

01:27.680 --> 01:31.515
I'm just gonna take
the dog for a walk.

01:33.920 --> 01:35.400
Okay.

02:19.800 --> 02:21.280
Nice office.

02:24.440 --> 02:25.440
Nice family.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.590
Sorry to disturb you
at this time of night...

02:33.760 --> 02:35.433
but we have a little problem.

02:36.080 --> 02:38.231
Your boss owes me money.

02:38.400 --> 02:40.198
A lot of money.

02:40.360 --> 02:42.113
And I'm here to collect it.

02:42.280 --> 02:44.511
I'm just the accountant.
I don't know anything.

02:44.720 --> 02:46.439
You don't need to
know anything...

02:47.440 --> 02:50.478
except the combination
to the safe.

02:50.640 --> 02:52.199
You do know
the combination, yes?

02:53.040 --> 02:54.110
Yes.

02:54.280 --> 02:56.078
Perfect. Please.

03:25.680 --> 03:26.909
Get in. Ah.

03:34.280 --> 03:38.752
<i>This is
310-555-0199. Leave a message.</i>

03:40.600 --> 03:44.594
Hello, my friend.
It's Malankov.

03:45.160 --> 03:48.597
I came to your office
to collect my money.

03:49.840 --> 03:52.753
What a disappointment
to see it's not here.

03:53.240 --> 03:56.472
But I am leaving you
something here in return.

03:57.160 --> 03:59.470
As a reminder.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.871
I cannot wait any longer.

04:05.920 --> 04:07.320
My best to the family.

05:48.920 --> 05:49.956
Sweet.

05:51.120 --> 05:52.236
Yeah.

05:52.400 --> 05:53.880
How old?

05:55.560 --> 05:57.358
No matter how old
they are, my friend...

05:57.520 --> 05:58.680
they will always be our baby.

05:58.720 --> 06:01.599
Ain't that true?
Come on, big guy.

06:02.640 --> 06:03.676
Thank you.

06:23.640 --> 06:25.393
- Whoa!
- Happy birthday!

06:26.160 --> 06:27.355
Dad!

06:28.400 --> 06:29.880
My birthday's
not even for three days.

06:30.040 --> 06:31.679
You're always saying
I'm so predictable.

06:31.840 --> 06:33.559
I wanted to shake
things up a bit,

06:33.640 --> 06:35.472
make it a little
less predictable.

06:36.520 --> 06:37.520
Sorry.

06:37.560 --> 06:38.710
Come in.

06:42.080 --> 06:44.231
- Champagne glasses?
- You know me.

06:44.640 --> 06:47.200
Why would I have
champagne glasses?

06:47.800 --> 06:50.110
Or a giant stuffed panda?

06:50.280 --> 06:51.316
I heard that.

06:52.160 --> 06:54.231
Inappropriate, huh?
Well, I mean...

06:55.600 --> 06:57.876
not if I was 7.
I can return it...

06:58.040 --> 06:59.110
or you can hang on to it

06:59.200 --> 07:00.761
until you have
a 7-year-old of your own.

07:01.640 --> 07:03.074
Not funny.

07:03.360 --> 07:04.760
Hey, baby. Babe? Hey!

07:04.920 --> 07:06.991
Hey, look who's here.
Mr. Mills.

07:07.560 --> 07:08.560
Hello, Jimy.

07:09.120 --> 07:10.713
How are you? Good. You?

07:11.720 --> 07:12.720
You know. Hey.

07:12.880 --> 07:13.950
Hi.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.314
Hey, if you guys are having

07:17.400 --> 07:18.754
a father-daughter moment,
I can really...

07:18.920 --> 07:20.798
No, no, no. I just dropped by.

07:21.000 --> 07:23.993
I thought I'd do
something unpredictable.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.001
Kim's always pointing out
how predictable I am.

07:26.160 --> 07:27.320
That's funny coming from her.

07:27.400 --> 07:28.680
You wanna talk
about predictable?

07:28.960 --> 07:30.474
I'm not predictable!
Oh, come on.

07:30.640 --> 07:31.869
Every single day...

07:32.040 --> 07:33.156
she goes to
the same exact store,

07:33.240 --> 07:34.674
right off campus,
every morning before class...

07:34.840 --> 07:35.840
and gets the same
peach yogurt drink.

07:35.920 --> 07:36.920
Stop.

07:37.080 --> 07:38.240
The fourth one from the back.

07:38.320 --> 07:39.913
Not the fifth one,
not the third one.

07:40.080 --> 07:42.276
The fourth one will stay cold,
but not too cold.

07:42.480 --> 07:43.834
That way,
when she's drinking it, uh,

07:43.920 --> 07:45.036
as a snack in between classes...

07:45.200 --> 07:47.351
It's still cold.

07:47.520 --> 07:49.557
I know. I would do
exactly the same thing.

07:49.720 --> 07:51.154
Yeah, the OCD gene.

07:51.280 --> 07:52.280
Uh...

07:52.400 --> 07:53.400
What's with the bubbly?

07:54.080 --> 07:55.958
Uh, pre-birthday celebration.

07:56.160 --> 07:57.594
If you don't mind, I just think

07:57.680 --> 08:00.240
it's a little early
to pop open a bottle.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.440
Yeah, no problem.

08:01.480 --> 08:02.994
I'll put it in the fridge.

08:04.560 --> 08:05.789
What's that?

08:06.000 --> 08:07.275
Whoa. A panda.

08:09.600 --> 08:10.600
That was awesome.

08:10.800 --> 08:11.950
I'll leave you two.

08:13.200 --> 08:14.554
Dad, don't...

08:14.760 --> 08:16.911
You don't have to take it.
Now I feel bad.

08:17.080 --> 08:18.912
Yeah, you should feel bad.

08:19.080 --> 08:21.595
I'll exchange it for
something more predictable.

08:22.000 --> 08:23.514
Love you. Take it easy, Jimy.

08:23.840 --> 08:24.840
Bye.

08:26.960 --> 08:28.952
Hey, babe.

08:29.120 --> 08:30.793
Is something wrong? Nothing.

08:30.960 --> 08:32.519
Are you sure, babe? Mmm-hmm.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.872
Stop. Stop.

08:54.960 --> 08:57.156
I just need a second, okay?

09:05.840 --> 09:08.036
You might want
to buckle up, Phillip.

09:09.560 --> 09:10.560
Bryan.

09:11.160 --> 09:12.480
How did it go?

09:13.120 --> 09:15.032
Great. Fantastic.

09:15.120 --> 09:16.474
Couldn't have gone better.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.313
The panda was not a hit,
I take it.

09:19.320 --> 09:20.470
Careful what you say.

09:20.600 --> 09:21.800
He's sitting right next to me.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.673
When did she grow up, Lenore?

09:25.160 --> 09:28.153
I know. It goes so fast.
All of it.

09:28.640 --> 09:29.640
<i>Where are you?</i>

09:30.440 --> 09:32.955
Just going home.
Make a little dinner.

09:34.160 --> 09:36.277
If you'd like to join us. "Us"?

09:36.440 --> 09:37.590
Me and the panda.

09:40.320 --> 09:42.880
I'll, uh, take
a rain check on that.

09:43.040 --> 09:44.394
<i>If that's okay with you?</i>

09:44.600 --> 09:45.795
And the panda?

09:46.760 --> 09:47.830
That's fine by us.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.559
<i>I'll see you.</i>

09:49.720 --> 09:50.720
See you.

09:55.440 --> 09:57.716
I know what you're thinking.

09:57.800 --> 09:59.154
Keep it to yourself.

10:07.880 --> 10:08.916
Oh, God.

10:25.720 --> 10:27.040
Hey. Lennie.

10:27.320 --> 10:28.549
You changed your mind!

10:28.720 --> 10:30.313
Yeah. Uh, you left
the door open.

10:30.680 --> 10:31.716
Come on in.

10:32.240 --> 10:33.594
Okay.

10:33.760 --> 10:35.592
I'm not intruding?
No, of course you're not.

10:35.760 --> 10:38.116
I was just preparing
dinner. Drink?

10:38.440 --> 10:40.079
Yes, please.

10:42.800 --> 10:43.836
Thanks for coming over.

10:46.280 --> 10:47.280
Cheers.

10:54.160 --> 10:55.514
You look stressed. Yeah.

10:55.680 --> 10:56.680
What?

10:56.840 --> 10:58.035
Stuart and I...

10:58.760 --> 11:00.194
We've tried everything.

11:00.360 --> 11:02.829
Therapy. Counseling.
Together, separately.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.952
He wants it to work.
He really does.

11:06.120 --> 11:07.156
And you?

11:07.320 --> 11:09.471
I know I'm hurting him.

11:09.800 --> 11:11.359
I just don't feel
anything anymore.

11:11.560 --> 11:12.960
I hate that.
I hate not feeling.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.839
I hate going through
the motions.

11:15.600 --> 11:17.034
The only thing
I feel is trapped.

11:18.160 --> 11:19.799
I have the worst taste in men!

11:20.000 --> 11:21.036
Thanks.

11:21.840 --> 11:23.877
Oh, no.

11:24.680 --> 11:25.716
No, not you.

11:25.880 --> 11:26.916
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.120
It's okay.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.030
Do you know what
I fantasize about?

11:33.200 --> 11:34.475
I'm afraid to ask.

11:37.000 --> 11:38.036
Us.

11:38.840 --> 11:40.832
Yeah? Mmm-hmm.

11:43.120 --> 11:44.349
And right after...

11:44.520 --> 11:47.080
the guilt comes roaring in
and I feel like such a shit.

11:48.760 --> 11:50.160
Does it make me a bad person...

11:50.320 --> 11:53.552
being married to one man,
fantasizing about another?

11:54.320 --> 11:57.757
Confused maybe. Bad? No.

11:59.960 --> 12:02.680
You must think I'm crazy.

12:02.840 --> 12:05.992
If you are, Lennie,
you're not the only one.

12:16.480 --> 12:17.994
Oh, Lennie.

12:19.680 --> 12:21.114
I'm sorry. No.

12:22.200 --> 12:23.873
It's me that should be
apologizing.

12:24.040 --> 12:26.839
It's not that I don't want to.
Believe me.

12:27.280 --> 12:30.034
But until you and Stuart
clear up your situation...

12:30.200 --> 12:32.351
I think it would do
more harm than good.

12:33.240 --> 12:34.310
For all of us.

12:34.520 --> 12:36.432
Why do you have
to be so damn honorable?

12:37.000 --> 12:39.469
Believe me, right now,
I wish I weren't.

12:40.720 --> 12:42.518
Uh, I'm gonna go. Wait.

12:46.080 --> 12:47.116
Here.

12:48.160 --> 12:50.720
I'm going out of town in a couple
of days for a month on a job.

12:50.880 --> 12:53.759
If you ever feel
you need to go someplace...

12:53.960 --> 12:55.758
just to be by yourself...

12:56.280 --> 12:57.316
use it.

12:57.400 --> 12:58.436
Thank you.

13:20.640 --> 13:21.915
I put on six pounds of muscle.

13:22.000 --> 13:23.520
Oh, you guys are
giving me a hard time.

13:23.640 --> 13:25.154
Well, it's not
helping your stroke.

13:25.480 --> 13:27.392
You were
plus two on the last one.

13:27.560 --> 13:29.313
You? Me?

13:29.480 --> 13:30.920
Did the rest of you
get on the green?

13:31.080 --> 13:32.958
I'm not even on the green.

13:33.160 --> 13:36.471
But seriously, it's money.
It would be fun.

13:36.640 --> 13:39.474
I know. I can't go, Sam.

13:39.640 --> 13:41.552
It's a four-man job.
We can't do it without you.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.757
I know. But a couple
of things have come up...

13:43.920 --> 13:47.231
and I'm not comfortable being
away for a month right now.

13:47.680 --> 13:49.319
Kim? It's not Kim.

13:49.840 --> 13:51.354
Man, you gotta let this go.
You do.

13:51.520 --> 13:53.955
Lenore's a grown woman.
She can take care of herself.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.679
You're not her
husband any longer.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.194
But she is my friend.

13:57.360 --> 13:59.636
I think you better talk
to somebody about this.

13:59.800 --> 14:01.075
A shrink, maybe.

14:01.240 --> 14:03.081
Why would I go to a shrink
when I got you guys?

14:03.400 --> 14:04.675
There's a good point.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.677
Can somebody
drop the flag stick?

14:09.480 --> 14:11.711
Hey, Kim. What's up?

14:11.880 --> 14:13.155
You want me to take it out?
If you wouldn't mind.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.390
Sure. When?

14:15.640 --> 14:17.154
Okay, baby.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.229
Okay. The big moment.

14:19.400 --> 14:21.392
That's a good shot.

14:25.120 --> 14:26.600
This is an unexpected treat.

14:26.800 --> 14:29.554
Yeah, I, um, need some advice.

14:30.160 --> 14:32.311
Okay, shoot.

14:33.760 --> 14:34.760
Um...

14:34.920 --> 14:38.755
I guess it's not something
I was really planning on...

14:38.920 --> 14:41.560
or even thought about, ever.

14:41.960 --> 14:43.713
Anyway, I just
wanted your advice.

14:43.880 --> 14:45.109
I'm flattered.

14:45.720 --> 14:47.234
Whoa.

14:48.320 --> 14:49.640
Poor lady.

14:50.360 --> 14:52.636
That is going to be serious
trouble in a few years.

14:53.160 --> 14:55.117
You mark my words.

14:56.520 --> 14:57.920
What was it you wanted to ask?

15:00.200 --> 15:01.270
Um...

15:04.520 --> 15:06.159
A puppy.

15:06.720 --> 15:07.870
A puppy? Yeah.

15:08.040 --> 15:10.236
I was thinking
about getting a puppy.

15:10.400 --> 15:11.914
From where? Um...

15:12.520 --> 15:15.080
My friend found one
behind her building...

15:15.760 --> 15:17.513
and we were trying
to find it a home...

15:17.680 --> 15:19.160
we put it on Facebook,

15:19.240 --> 15:20.833
but nobody claimed it yet, so...

15:21.000 --> 15:22.150
You wanna know what I think?

15:22.920 --> 15:24.240
Yeah.

15:24.440 --> 15:26.875
I mean, it's a lot of work.

15:26.960 --> 15:28.553
It's a lot of responsibility.

15:28.720 --> 15:29.720
With your lifestyle

15:29.800 --> 15:31.712
the way it is at the moment,
with college.

15:31.880 --> 15:33.314
With a puppy
you have to be there

15:33.400 --> 15:35.756
all the time
and feed it, walk it.

15:35.920 --> 15:37.559
It's no different
than having a kid.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.840
Have you had a chance
to look at the menus?

15:41.040 --> 15:42.190
Uh, not yet, Annie.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.759
What will I have?

15:50.080 --> 15:51.719
Stuart. Hey, Bryan.

15:51.880 --> 15:53.030
What are you doing here?

15:53.360 --> 15:54.360
Um...

15:54.560 --> 15:55.880
Everything all right?

15:56.040 --> 15:57.713
Yeah. It's fine.

15:58.800 --> 16:00.075
Can I talk to you inside?

16:00.240 --> 16:02.471
Yeah, yeah, sure.
I was just making some coffee.

16:02.640 --> 16:03.869
Milk? Sugar?

16:04.560 --> 16:05.560
Um, both, please.

16:06.040 --> 16:08.635
Okay. Milk, cold or hot?

16:08.840 --> 16:09.840
Uh...

16:10.320 --> 16:11.320
Hot, please.

16:16.560 --> 16:18.916
So, how's business?
Oh, you know.

16:19.120 --> 16:21.794
Some days good, some days great.

16:22.320 --> 16:23.320
Yeah.

16:26.920 --> 16:28.752
One sugar or two?

16:28.880 --> 16:29.880
Um...

16:32.360 --> 16:34.556
Two, please.

16:39.080 --> 16:41.072
Here we go. Thanks.

16:44.520 --> 16:45.590
Um...

16:46.760 --> 16:48.433
I'm sorry to
bother you this late...

16:48.600 --> 16:51.479
but I thought it was more,
um, respectful...

16:51.640 --> 16:53.120
to say what I have to say to you

16:53.240 --> 16:54.754
face-to-face, man-to-man.

16:54.920 --> 16:56.718
So to speak.

16:56.880 --> 16:59.190
I know that Lenore has...

16:59.360 --> 17:02.080
She's spoken to you about the
problems that we've been having.

17:02.440 --> 17:03.510
Um...

17:03.600 --> 17:05.159
You're a good guy, Bryan.
I like you.

17:05.319 --> 17:06.720
You're a respectful guy.

17:06.920 --> 17:09.992
And, listen, I'm not
accusing you of anything.

17:10.160 --> 17:12.277
But Lenore and I...

17:12.440 --> 17:15.079
if our marriage is gonna work...

17:15.240 --> 17:17.471
that can't happen
with you in between us.

17:18.960 --> 17:20.758
But, Stuart...

17:20.920 --> 17:22.832
there's nothing
between Lenore and I,

17:22.920 --> 17:24.752
other than we share Kim.

17:24.920 --> 17:26.638
I didn't say there was.

17:26.800 --> 17:28.233
Obviously...

17:28.440 --> 17:29.794
you share a daughter...

17:29.960 --> 17:32.680
and, uh, you've tried to be
the best father that you can,

17:32.760 --> 17:34.035
under the circumstances.

17:34.880 --> 17:36.519
And, uh, part of that

17:36.600 --> 17:39.434
means the two of you
talking and staying in touch.

17:40.760 --> 17:43.320
But I still want you
to stop seeing my wife.

17:43.480 --> 17:44.630
Until we sort things out.

17:45.880 --> 17:47.394
Does she know you're here?

17:47.560 --> 17:49.119
It doesn't matter if she does,
or if she doesn't.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.280
That's not the point.

17:50.400 --> 17:52.631
I'm asking you to stop seeing my wife.
Can you do that?

17:57.560 --> 17:59.233
I can do that.

18:00.480 --> 18:02.631
Wow. That's great.

18:02.800 --> 18:03.800
Thank you.

18:03.920 --> 18:05.240
I gotta go to Vegas tonight.

18:05.320 --> 18:06.640
Some business meeting tomorrow.

18:07.240 --> 18:09.835
I really don't want to be
worrying about...

18:10.000 --> 18:11.116
you know. Yeah.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.360
Thank you.

18:13.160 --> 18:14.753
I really appreciate it.

18:45.600 --> 18:48.354
"Need to see you.
Urgent. Bagels."

19:08.440 --> 19:11.433
Uh, four bagels and some
cream cheese, please.

19:11.600 --> 19:12.600
Okay.

19:13.520 --> 19:15.716
Be careful.
They're really hot. Thanks.

19:15.920 --> 19:17.281
Have a good day.
Thanks. Take care.

19:20.280 --> 19:21.280
<i>Hello?</i>

19:28.920 --> 19:29.920
Lennie?

19:52.520 --> 19:53.520
Lennie?

20:00.920 --> 20:01.920
Lennie?

20:02.760 --> 20:03.955
Lennie.

20:05.080 --> 20:06.080
Jesus, God.

20:06.240 --> 20:07.913
Lennie? Wake up!

20:10.400 --> 20:11.914
Come on, come on!

20:12.080 --> 20:14.436
Lennie! Freeze! Don't move!

20:15.080 --> 20:16.275
Step away from the knife.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.392
Get your hands up!
Sir, back away, now.

20:18.560 --> 20:19.560
I didn't do this.

20:19.640 --> 20:20.710
Get your hands up, now!

20:22.280 --> 20:23.280
Slowly.

20:24.280 --> 20:25.316
Get your hands up.

20:25.400 --> 20:26.754
You gotta listen to me.
On the floor, now!

20:26.880 --> 20:27.880
Listen to me.

20:27.920 --> 20:29.912
Down on the floor!
Listen to me.

20:30.040 --> 20:31.040
Step away from the knife!

20:31.120 --> 20:32.474
On your knees. Now!

20:32.600 --> 20:33.600
Down!

20:34.920 --> 20:36.115
Get your hands up!

20:36.280 --> 20:37.999
Hands up!

20:38.720 --> 20:40.837
Hands up! Higher!

20:42.840 --> 20:44.160
<i>I didn't do this.</i>

20:55.640 --> 20:56.790
Shit! Moving in!

21:03.440 --> 21:04.476
He's there!

21:09.480 --> 21:10.800
Hey! Hey!

21:10.960 --> 21:12.155
Drop your weapon!

21:34.000 --> 21:35.070
Oh, he's heading west!

21:53.120 --> 21:54.840
He's heading north.
22nd street. Back alley.

21:59.680 --> 22:00.680
Stop!

22:10.480 --> 22:11.480
Suspect in sight.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.681
Go inside. I'm heading back.

22:30.760 --> 22:31.796
Hey!

22:31.880 --> 22:32.880
Hey! Police!

22:45.040 --> 22:46.110
Door's sealed!

22:46.280 --> 22:47.760
- I just saw him inside.
- Shit!

23:03.400 --> 23:04.675
Clear! Moving in!

23:07.320 --> 23:08.390
You see him anywhere?

23:10.760 --> 23:12.433
He disappeared.

23:13.520 --> 23:14.520
God damn it. He's gone.

23:15.720 --> 23:18.599
This is 103. Suspect is gone.

24:36.680 --> 24:37.680
Yeah.

24:38.160 --> 24:39.913
<i>Kim, it's Dad.</i>

24:40.560 --> 24:41.994
Where are you?

24:42.160 --> 24:43.196
I'm at Mom's.

24:43.280 --> 24:44.714
Looking for my yellow sweater.

24:44.920 --> 24:46.513
<i>Are you alone?</i>

24:46.680 --> 24:49.559
Stuart is in Vegas. Why?

24:50.320 --> 24:51.754
I have something to tell you.

24:52.600 --> 24:53.600
Dad?

24:56.200 --> 24:57.873
Dad, what's wrong?

24:58.040 --> 25:00.032
<i>Something terrible has happened.</i>

25:00.200 --> 25:01.761
And I want you
to hear it from me first.

25:02.600 --> 25:04.671
<i>Your mom...</i>

25:05.640 --> 25:06.869
She's dead.

25:08.120 --> 25:10.396
<i>Someone murdered her...</i>

25:10.560 --> 25:12.791
<i>in my apartment.</i>

25:13.880 --> 25:14.950
It looks like I did it.

25:15.520 --> 25:17.557
<i>I don't know why.
I don't know who.</i>

25:18.320 --> 25:19.515
But I'm going to find out.

25:21.400 --> 25:23.039
<i>Listen carefully, Kim.</i>

25:23.200 --> 25:25.237
No matter what anyone says,
don't trust them.

25:25.520 --> 25:26.795
No. <i>You hear?</i>

25:27.000 --> 25:28.240
I'll find a way to contact you.

25:28.320 --> 25:29.515
But Dad...

25:29.680 --> 25:30.680
Try to be strong.

25:30.880 --> 25:32.394
Dad? I love you.

25:32.560 --> 25:33.914
<i>Wait.</i>

26:15.520 --> 26:18.877
Sergeant Dotzler,
suspect's name is Bryan Mills.

26:19.040 --> 26:20.918
His? His.

26:22.640 --> 26:23.640
Not his.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.480
The officers arrived
on the scene because...?

26:30.600 --> 26:32.034
Anonymous call came in,

26:32.120 --> 26:33.315
reported a woman screaming...

26:33.520 --> 26:34.881
"He's killing me.
He's killing me."

26:35.520 --> 26:38.592
Her name is Lenore St. John.

26:38.760 --> 26:41.080
We sent a car to her address.
It was listed on her license.

26:41.160 --> 26:43.516
Her daughter was there, but her
husband was in Las Vegas on business.

26:43.680 --> 26:45.797
He's, uh, taking
the first flight home.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.111
Any witnesses?
We're canvassing now.

26:48.280 --> 26:50.112
Call came from
an unlisted number.

26:50.480 --> 26:52.278
We're checking out
the cells as well.

26:52.440 --> 26:55.000
Download both of the phones,
correlate the data.

26:55.160 --> 26:58.232
I want to know
when these two people...

26:58.440 --> 27:00.796
spoke, texted, emailed.

27:01.120 --> 27:02.998
Every form of communication.

27:03.160 --> 27:04.355
Dates, times...

27:04.800 --> 27:05.916
duration of calls.

27:12.640 --> 27:14.393
Let's bag this.

27:14.560 --> 27:15.835
Detective, bag that.

27:29.360 --> 27:30.360
What's wrong?

27:32.680 --> 27:34.114
Good.

27:35.080 --> 27:36.878
<i>Right now,
this is still a very active crime scene.</i>

27:36.960 --> 27:38.599
<i>Investigators have been here
on the scene</i>

27:38.680 --> 27:40.433
<i>all morning, but so far...</i>

27:40.600 --> 27:43.752
<i>police have not told us what
happened inside the apartment...</i>

27:43.920 --> 27:45.149
<i>where earlier this morning...</i>

27:45.320 --> 27:47.152
<i>a woman's body was discovered.</i>

27:47.680 --> 27:49.831
<i>Bryan Mills is the owner
of the apartment...</i>

27:50.000 --> 27:52.276
<i>and the ex-husband of the deceased.</i>

27:52.480 --> 27:54.233
- Who's this?
<i>- It's me.</i>

27:54.440 --> 27:55.510
You're on the news.

27:55.680 --> 27:56.830
<i>I didn't do it, Sam.</i>

27:57.000 --> 27:59.117
Obviously, you didn't do it.
Are you all right?

27:59.320 --> 28:02.074
I'm going down the rabbit hole.
The code still the same?

28:02.280 --> 28:03.509
Yeah. It's still the same.

28:03.680 --> 28:05.433
I'll be in touch. <i>Be careful.</i>

28:10.880 --> 28:13.600
So, this is the area
we lost him, sir.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.080
The guy vanished.

28:15.240 --> 28:17.197
Uh, that's the gun
that he took, uh, off

28:17.280 --> 28:19.158
one of our officers, sir.

28:20.000 --> 28:22.196
He had a gun,
and he didn't fire at you?

28:22.360 --> 28:23.396
No, sir.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.314
And the helicopters...

28:31.520 --> 28:32.840
saw nothing?

28:33.000 --> 28:34.798
Choppers didn't see
anything, sir. No.

28:43.240 --> 28:45.232
I know he's good...

28:45.400 --> 28:46.400
but...

28:48.000 --> 28:50.276
vanishing into thin air?

28:51.360 --> 28:52.476
Let's move the truck.

30:25.520 --> 30:29.719
Do you know why your wife
went to visit Mr. Mills?

30:29.880 --> 30:31.360
No, I don't know.

30:31.840 --> 30:33.035
Their relationship

30:33.120 --> 30:34.760
was mostly centered
around their daughter.

30:35.080 --> 30:36.480
Um, but I think...

30:36.640 --> 30:38.472
he wanted more than friendship.

30:38.640 --> 30:40.950
I asked her to speak to him...

30:41.120 --> 30:43.715
and tell him that he should
stop bothering her about it.

30:44.320 --> 30:46.357
So you think that's what
she was doing over there?

30:46.680 --> 30:47.750
I don't know.

30:47.920 --> 30:48.990
What are you doing?

30:49.200 --> 30:51.590
Stuart, why are they going
through all of Mom's stuff?

30:52.120 --> 30:53.120
Hey, Kim.

30:54.080 --> 30:56.117
Miss St. John, Frank Dotzler.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.840
Mills. My name is Mills.

30:59.280 --> 31:00.430
Sorry for all the chaos.

31:00.800 --> 31:02.120
We're just looking around

31:02.200 --> 31:03.395
to see if we can find
something to help us.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.914
I know what you're looking for.

31:05.200 --> 31:06.759
I would just really like

31:06.840 --> 31:09.355
them out of her bedroom
for a few minutes.

31:14.960 --> 31:17.919
Garcia, let's vacate
the bedroom.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.719
Everybody out of the bedroom.

31:21.360 --> 31:22.714
Thank you.

31:23.040 --> 31:24.040
If I could just have
a few minutes

31:24.120 --> 31:25.600
of your time.
Ask you a few questions.

31:26.040 --> 31:28.714
Why aren't you out there trying
to find out who did this...

31:28.880 --> 31:30.712
instead of just standing around,
going through our home?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.310
We have people
out there looking.

31:33.480 --> 31:35.676
But in order for me
to get a full picture...

31:35.840 --> 31:36.840
I have to ask questions of him.

31:36.920 --> 31:38.160
I have to ask questions of you.

31:38.200 --> 31:40.317
My mom went to see my dad.
I don't know why.

31:41.080 --> 31:43.037
Probably to talk about me.

31:43.440 --> 31:44.920
Look, there's just...

31:46.280 --> 31:47.475
He didn't do it.

31:48.960 --> 31:50.792
He just didn't.
He didn't do it.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.713
There's no way on earth
he would lay a hand on her.

31:52.800 --> 31:53.800
Just, don't.

32:00.560 --> 32:02.597
He loved her.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.199
That's all I know.

32:14.440 --> 32:15.476
Please.

32:15.640 --> 32:17.518
That's mine.
That's not even hers.

32:20.200 --> 32:21.316
Excuse me.

33:13.560 --> 33:14.630
I'm sorry.

33:15.360 --> 33:16.396
Oh, God.

33:16.560 --> 33:18.233
Come on, let's get you home.

33:19.320 --> 33:23.360
If something comes to mind,
anything at all...

33:25.680 --> 33:28.240
It might not be anything.

33:29.080 --> 33:30.560
Um, you know what
happened in Paris

33:30.640 --> 33:31.790
and Istanbul
a couple years ago...

33:31.960 --> 33:33.838
where Bryan saved his family.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.560
Sure. You think
that's connected to this?

33:38.720 --> 33:41.519
I never really wanted
to know all the details...

33:41.680 --> 33:44.036
but a lot of people ended
up dead and now this.

33:46.240 --> 33:48.709
So what you're telling me is...

33:48.920 --> 33:50.912
I'm dealing with
a very dangerous man.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
No.

33:52.440 --> 33:54.432
No. Bryan's not dangerous.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.513
The world he lives in is.

33:57.720 --> 33:59.837
He loves his family...

34:00.000 --> 34:02.993
but he has a lot of enemies.

34:03.160 --> 34:04.640
I see.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.438
Bring him into Room Three.

34:17.440 --> 34:19.670
Garcia will, uh,
get you back home.

34:20.440 --> 34:21.954
Thank you.

36:07.640 --> 36:09.120
<i>This guy's a ghost.</i>

36:09.280 --> 36:11.476
At 21, he's in the army.

36:11.640 --> 36:13.996
At 23, he joins Special Forces.

36:14.280 --> 36:15.280
Then he's gone.

36:15.480 --> 36:17.119
No service record.

36:17.320 --> 36:18.390
No discharge.

36:18.560 --> 36:19.630
Nothing. Nothing.

36:19.800 --> 36:21.234
Sounds like spy shit to me.

36:21.400 --> 36:23.357
Until we have another suspect,
he's our man.

36:23.920 --> 36:25.400
So here's our best way
of finding him.

36:25.520 --> 36:27.000
His daughter with the deceased.

36:27.200 --> 36:29.840
Her husband says that
he's really close to her.

36:29.960 --> 36:30.960
Devoted to her.

36:31.040 --> 36:33.191
So let's keep
a close watch on her.

36:33.360 --> 36:34.396
Where she goes,

36:34.480 --> 36:35.800
who she calls, who she talks to.

36:36.000 --> 36:37.480
Let's not screw this up, okay?

36:37.640 --> 36:39.472
So, this is gonna be
our best shot...

36:40.120 --> 36:41.156
at finding him.

36:41.320 --> 36:42.640
Do we have the deceased's car?

36:43.000 --> 36:45.674
Yeah, that just came in.
They have his, too.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.560
All right. Garcia, Smith.

36:49.560 --> 36:51.438
<i>Let's do a full
sweep of the car.</i>

36:51.640 --> 36:53.472
<i>GPS downloaded,
see where he went and when.</i>

36:53.640 --> 36:54.710
<i>See if they correlate.</i>

36:55.520 --> 36:57.113
<i>See if we can find out
what's going on.</i>

37:02.320 --> 37:03.834
Just came in, his and hers.

37:04.120 --> 37:05.190
Let's go, then.

37:20.200 --> 37:21.316
Follow me.

37:35.560 --> 37:36.789
So, what's this about?

37:36.960 --> 37:38.280
Some guy offed his ex.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.153
Allegedly.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.716
Right. Allegedly.

37:53.720 --> 37:55.120
He didn't do her
in the car, did he?

37:55.160 --> 37:56.310
No, in his house.

37:56.480 --> 37:58.392
Good.
I hate going in those after.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.517
Blood. Pieces of flesh
and shit.

38:00.680 --> 38:01.680
It's disgusting.

38:06.400 --> 38:07.754
Which GPS you want done first?

38:08.240 --> 38:10.072
His, then hers.

38:10.240 --> 38:11.356
Right over here.

38:35.440 --> 38:37.432
What the hell were you doing

38:37.520 --> 38:39.000
all the way out there, Lenore?

38:46.160 --> 38:47.753
Excuse me.

38:47.920 --> 38:49.912
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.

38:50.240 --> 38:52.994
We're following up on a
missing persons investigation.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.675
I was wondering
if you'd seen this woman.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.000
Nope.

38:57.120 --> 38:58.839
She was here
about 10 p.m. last night.

38:59.000 --> 39:00.000
I was here then.

39:00.440 --> 39:03.035
I didn't see her.
I didn't see hardly nobody.

39:03.200 --> 39:06.159
Not exactly a bustling destination,
if you know what I mean.

39:06.360 --> 39:07.396
Hey, Sally.

39:07.720 --> 39:08.756
Excuse me.

39:08.920 --> 39:09.956
Duty calls.

39:14.440 --> 39:16.193
Amanda?

39:19.080 --> 39:20.116
Excuse me.

39:20.720 --> 39:22.871
Inspector Mallory, LAPD.

39:23.040 --> 39:25.077
Are these security
cameras operative...

39:25.240 --> 39:26.276
or are they just there for show?

39:26.440 --> 39:27.920
Yeah, they work.

39:28.720 --> 39:30.120
Follow me.

39:30.680 --> 39:32.160
You have the tape
from yesterday?

39:32.320 --> 39:33.879
I wasn't here.
The other guy was.

39:34.040 --> 39:36.396
But if someone was here,
it will be on there.

39:40.200 --> 39:41.953
Just push that button
for the playback.

39:43.280 --> 39:45.875
I'm just gonna stay here
while you look at that.

40:10.600 --> 40:12.273
You have problems
with this system?

40:12.440 --> 40:13.590
Breaks down sometimes.

40:13.720 --> 40:15.360
They keep saying
they're gonna replace it.

40:19.080 --> 40:20.514
Excuse me.

40:20.680 --> 40:21.716
Have you seen this woman?

40:25.560 --> 40:27.233
You fellas should get
more coordinated.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.601
Coordinated? What do you mean?
Like, color-coordinated?

40:29.760 --> 40:31.080
No, like, one of your guys

40:31.160 --> 40:32.680
was just in here
asking the same thing.

40:32.920 --> 40:34.274
One of our guys? Yeah.

40:37.400 --> 40:39.198
Him? Yeah. Him.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.392
Took off to the gas station.

40:52.240 --> 40:53.240
Shh.

41:27.240 --> 41:28.390
Freeze!

41:29.680 --> 41:30.680
Mr. Mills?

41:31.520 --> 41:32.670
Freeze!

41:32.880 --> 41:34.519
- Step out, buddy.
- Get out of the room.

41:34.720 --> 41:35.720
Freeze!

41:36.240 --> 41:37.754
Stop what you're doing,
Mr. Mills!

41:37.920 --> 41:38.920
Step away from the desk!

41:39.440 --> 41:40.600
Back away from the desk, sir.

41:40.640 --> 41:42.360
Step away from that desk,
or I'll shoot you!

41:43.200 --> 41:45.431
Back away from the goddamn desk!

41:45.600 --> 41:46.636
Now!

41:47.440 --> 41:50.035
Step away one step
from the desk.

41:50.560 --> 41:52.631
Just keep your hands
where we can see them.

41:52.800 --> 41:54.075
Stay perfectly still.

42:04.720 --> 42:05.756
You know the drill.

42:05.960 --> 42:07.030
Anything you say can and will be

42:07.120 --> 42:08.759
used against you
in a court of law.

42:08.960 --> 42:10.474
You have the right
to an attorney...

42:10.640 --> 42:13.280
to have one present
during questioning.

42:50.200 --> 42:52.112
Brooks. All right.

42:58.840 --> 42:59.956
Garcia and Smith.

43:00.120 --> 43:01.120
They got him.

43:13.640 --> 43:15.313
Garcia.
<i>Yeah, just picked him up.</i>

43:15.480 --> 43:16.596
Easy-peasy.

43:16.760 --> 43:18.319
If he's a pro like you said...

43:18.480 --> 43:19.914
<i>he wasn't on his game today.</i>

43:20.080 --> 43:21.840
He's playing you!
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

43:21.960 --> 43:23.110
Where is he? Where is he?

43:23.280 --> 43:25.431
He's back
in Phillips' car. Why?

43:25.600 --> 43:26.670
Stop the cars! <i>What?</i>

43:26.840 --> 43:27.840
Stop the cars!

43:28.000 --> 43:29.000
Now!

43:30.280 --> 43:31.280
Oh, come on!

43:35.480 --> 43:37.199
Phillips. Yeah?

43:37.360 --> 43:38.476
<i>Our boss has got a hair</i>

43:38.560 --> 43:39.835
<i>up his ass about something.</i>

43:40.000 --> 43:41.673
Just keep an eye
on this guy, all right?

43:42.760 --> 43:43.830
Yeah, okay.

43:45.120 --> 43:47.032
- They think we're idiots.
- It's unbelievable.

43:48.840 --> 43:50.441
He acts like I've never
done this before.

43:50.560 --> 43:52.119
He's just being Dotzler.

43:52.280 --> 43:53.920
You know what it is?
He's a control freak.

43:53.960 --> 43:55.720
If he's not doing it himself,
he's not happy.

44:29.440 --> 44:30.440
Keep driving!

44:35.560 --> 44:36.560
Phillips!

44:39.680 --> 44:40.680
Come on.

45:10.760 --> 45:11.800
What the hell is he doing?

45:25.640 --> 45:26.640
Pull it over!

45:59.920 --> 46:00.920
Back it up!

46:07.800 --> 46:08.800
Get out of the car!

46:17.320 --> 46:18.356
Drive!

46:29.680 --> 46:30.680
Stop the car.

46:32.000 --> 46:33.000
Come on, move.

46:35.600 --> 46:36.600
Radio.

46:37.040 --> 46:38.235
Cell phone.

46:39.280 --> 46:40.714
This is gonna end bad for you.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.749
Don't be such a pessimist.

46:52.440 --> 46:54.671
<i>Connecting to LAPD protected files.</i>

47:01.280 --> 47:03.397
<i>All units, code 10-29</i>

47:03.480 --> 47:04.994
<i>on a police car number 706.</i>

47:05.720 --> 47:06.836
<i>Number 706.</i>

47:12.960 --> 47:13.996
Suspect in sight.

47:53.320 --> 47:54.320
Here, here!

48:25.240 --> 48:26.240
Send some backup, now!

49:28.600 --> 49:29.636
Dotzler.

49:29.800 --> 49:31.632
By now, I'm sure
you know who I am.

49:31.800 --> 49:33.314
You know what I'm capable of.

49:34.640 --> 49:35.835
I am beginning to.

49:36.320 --> 49:38.312
Let me ask you something,
just so I'm clear.

49:38.400 --> 49:39.400
CIA operative?

49:39.480 --> 49:41.711
Division 6? Division 7? What?

49:41.880 --> 49:43.320
All you have to know
is I'm innocent.

49:43.520 --> 49:45.079
<i>Give me two days,
I can prove it.</i>

49:45.240 --> 49:46.390
I can find out who did it.

49:47.240 --> 49:49.914
You may very well
be innocent, Mr. Mills.

49:50.080 --> 49:51.878
But that's the court's job
to decide, it's not mine.

49:52.120 --> 49:53.156
<i>My job...</i>

49:53.320 --> 49:55.760
is to bring you in and let the
law take its course, that's it.

49:56.800 --> 49:58.359
Good luck.

50:11.760 --> 50:13.672
I got a GPS on the phone.
He's heading north.

50:13.840 --> 50:15.593
You want me to send units?

50:15.760 --> 50:17.672
Don't bother. He's gone.

50:24.080 --> 50:25.673
It's a dead end. Wait, wait.

50:28.120 --> 50:30.351
Why does he want us
to have this?

50:30.440 --> 50:33.194
He fucked up.
This guy doesn't fuck up.

50:33.280 --> 50:34.280
He wants us to watch it.

50:34.920 --> 50:36.070
Why?

50:36.400 --> 50:37.754
I don't know yet.

50:39.400 --> 50:40.436
Who is she waiting for?

50:46.800 --> 50:47.836
Who are these guys?

50:49.640 --> 50:51.233
Holy shit! Who are these guys?

50:52.920 --> 50:54.115
Give me our tech guy.

50:54.320 --> 50:56.118
I need some magic done
on a security tape.

50:56.320 --> 50:57.640
Now. Right now.

51:10.160 --> 51:11.640
Hey, let me guess.

51:11.800 --> 51:13.917
Pileup on the 710 North.

51:14.000 --> 51:17.232
Massive clusterfuck
of police vehicles...

51:17.320 --> 51:18.959
15 miles headed south.

51:19.120 --> 51:20.156
Sounds about right.

51:21.320 --> 51:23.073
Hey, thanks, Sam.

51:26.600 --> 51:28.000
You want to tell me
what's going on?

51:28.200 --> 51:29.793
Lenore sent me a text.

51:29.960 --> 51:31.872
Asked to come over
to my place for bagels.

51:32.040 --> 51:33.110
I got the bagels.

51:33.280 --> 51:36.318
When I came back,
I found her car out front.

51:37.640 --> 51:38.676
Um...

51:38.840 --> 51:41.309
She was in my bed
with her throat slashed.

51:42.000 --> 51:43.000
Oh, Jesus.

51:46.200 --> 51:47.316
What else?

51:47.480 --> 51:49.551
I found a location
on her car's GPS

51:49.640 --> 51:50.835
from the night before.

51:51.040 --> 51:53.475
She was out at this gas station
in the middle of nowhere.

51:54.160 --> 51:55.360
I saw it on a security camera.

51:56.080 --> 51:57.400
She was snatched.

51:58.480 --> 51:59.914
What do you want us to do?

52:00.080 --> 52:02.072
I downloaded
all her phone records

52:02.160 --> 52:03.833
from the police files.
And mine.

52:04.520 --> 52:06.318
Maybe there's something there.

52:07.160 --> 52:08.674
I need analysis of this.

52:09.680 --> 52:10.830
Her hair.

52:11.000 --> 52:12.320
Might turn up something,
might turn up nothing.

52:12.840 --> 52:14.194
Anything else?

52:14.720 --> 52:17.599
I want to go to the funeral.

52:18.360 --> 52:20.511
<i>The Bible constantly tells us...</i>

52:20.680 --> 52:22.592
that there will be
difficult times in life...

52:22.760 --> 52:24.513
when we feel like
we are walking...

52:24.680 --> 52:26.672
through a dark,
dangerous valley.

52:27.520 --> 52:29.716
Valley of the shadow of death.

52:29.880 --> 52:32.190
But what the word of God
does make very clear...

52:33.360 --> 52:35.511
is that, as we move
through such times...

52:35.680 --> 52:37.194
"the Lord is my shepherd."

52:37.360 --> 52:39.750
"He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures."

52:40.240 --> 52:44.120
<i>"He leadeth
me beside still waters."</i>

52:45.040 --> 52:46.394
In the name of the Father...

52:46.600 --> 52:47.875
and of the Son...

52:48.400 --> 52:49.800
<i>and of the Holy Spirit.</i>

52:56.640 --> 52:57.915
<i>Are you holding up?</i>

52:59.920 --> 53:01.559
- Right there.
- Mmm-hmm.

53:01.640 --> 53:03.711
Get me sound on that.
Right there.

53:04.240 --> 53:06.755
Kim, I'm so sorry.

53:07.280 --> 53:08.873
<i>If there's anything we can do...</i>

53:11.240 --> 53:12.879
Hey.

53:13.600 --> 53:14.795
<i>We're there for you.</i>

53:14.920 --> 53:16.241
<i>- You know that, right?
- Mmm-hmm.</i>

53:19.080 --> 53:20.958
Hey, baby. Hey.

53:22.280 --> 53:23.760
<i>I just want to go home.</i>

53:27.480 --> 53:28.834
You hear that?

53:29.000 --> 53:30.070
You hear that click?

53:30.240 --> 53:32.120
Yeah. We're getting some
interference somewhere.

53:37.480 --> 53:38.960
There it goes again.

53:39.680 --> 53:41.160
Hey. Hi.

53:41.680 --> 53:42.750
Oh, sweetie.

53:44.160 --> 53:45.276
They're jamming our signal.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.797
I know. I know.

53:48.360 --> 53:50.636
I'm so, so sorry.

53:50.800 --> 53:51.916
Listen.

53:52.360 --> 53:53.919
He'll be in touch.

53:54.120 --> 53:55.793
Just stick to your schedule.

53:56.000 --> 53:58.435
Your very predictable schedule.

54:33.160 --> 54:34.560
You want me to
put a tail on them?

54:34.720 --> 54:37.235
No, it's a waste of time.
It'd be a waste of our money.

54:37.400 --> 54:38.675
These guys could lose a tail

54:38.760 --> 54:40.240
if it was attached to a dog.

54:40.560 --> 54:41.676
We're done.

54:41.880 --> 54:42.916
Cut the feed.

55:14.080 --> 55:15.280
Stuart, why are there still...

55:17.200 --> 55:19.351
Why are there still
cops camped outside?

55:19.840 --> 55:22.196
Uh, I think it's standard
operating procedure.

55:22.360 --> 55:25.273
They think my dad's going to show up here?
Are they stupid or something?

55:25.440 --> 55:27.591
I don't know what they think.

55:27.800 --> 55:30.554
Inspector Dotzler asked
if we minded and I said no.

55:30.760 --> 55:33.275
You should have asked me.
I mind.

55:34.240 --> 55:35.390
I'm sorry.

55:35.600 --> 55:36.636
And who's he?

55:37.400 --> 55:38.400
Well, um...

55:39.280 --> 55:40.714
We need protection.

55:42.560 --> 55:43.630
Kim, honey,

55:43.720 --> 55:45.680
I know it's hard on you,
but it's hard on me, too.

55:46.200 --> 55:48.120
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
it was a competition.

55:50.800 --> 55:52.393
It's not a competition.

55:52.560 --> 55:54.791
Please, don't hate me.

55:54.960 --> 55:56.872
I'm not responsible
for what happened.

55:57.800 --> 55:59.757
I don't hate you, Stuart.

56:00.240 --> 56:02.232
But for the last two years...

56:02.400 --> 56:04.631
every time I looked
into my mom's eyes...

56:04.840 --> 56:07.639
the only thing I saw
was hurt and sadness.

56:08.400 --> 56:09.629
And for that...

56:09.840 --> 56:12.799
I do hold you responsible.

56:18.080 --> 56:19.514
Where are you going? School.

56:19.920 --> 56:21.752
If I'm allowed.

56:56.000 --> 56:57.912
I got you, baby. I got you.

57:15.280 --> 57:16.280
Hmm.

57:19.480 --> 57:20.800
Why are you following me?

57:20.960 --> 57:22.321
It's for your
own protection, miss.

57:22.400 --> 57:24.357
Protection? From who?

57:24.520 --> 57:26.477
My father?

57:26.640 --> 57:28.836
You really think
my father would hurt me?

57:29.000 --> 57:31.151
Your mother probably
didn't think so either.

57:32.000 --> 57:33.000
Asshole.

57:39.840 --> 57:40.910
- Hey.
- Hey.

58:17.200 --> 58:18.236
Anything?

58:18.400 --> 58:20.073
<i>She's on campus.
You want me to follow?</i>

58:20.240 --> 58:21.560
Is the bug active?

58:21.720 --> 58:24.713
Yes. <i>Okay. Stay there. Listen.</i>

58:24.880 --> 58:26.200
If he shows up, we'll hear it.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.670
<i>What else?</i>
She went into this convenience store,

58:28.760 --> 58:30.194
chugged down
a drink of some kind...

58:30.400 --> 58:32.676
<i>right from the fridge.</i>
All right.

58:32.760 --> 58:34.035
<i>Keep me informed.</i>

59:07.520 --> 59:09.159
<i>As you might
remember, last week...</i>

59:09.320 --> 59:11.516
we discussed disassociations...

59:11.680 --> 59:15.674
and interactions between
dorsal and ventral streams...

59:15.840 --> 59:17.320
<i>in object recognition.</i>

59:17.480 --> 59:19.358
<i>Now, a dominant hypothesis...</i>

59:19.840 --> 59:21.638
is that the dorsal stream
is supporting

59:21.720 --> 59:23.951
motor interactions with objects.

59:24.160 --> 59:26.516
While ventral stream
structures extract

59:26.600 --> 59:27.920
visual information...

59:28.120 --> 59:30.351
about the object
that is independent.

59:30.520 --> 59:31.720
I'm feeling a little nauseous.

59:32.680 --> 59:34.114
Would you mind
taking notes for me?

59:34.280 --> 59:35.634
Yeah, sure. Thanks.

59:35.840 --> 59:37.957
Now, in other words,
object knowledge

59:38.040 --> 59:40.111
is represented
in the ventral stream...

59:48.640 --> 59:51.200
Excuse me. I wonder if you could,
um, help me out with something?

59:51.320 --> 59:52.390
Sure.

59:53.280 --> 59:54.953
There was a young woman
in here...

59:55.120 --> 59:56.793
about an hour ago? Oh, yeah.

59:56.960 --> 59:57.960
Poor kid.

59:58.120 --> 59:59.634
Does she come here often?
Every day.

59:59.720 --> 01:00:00.720
She bought what?

01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.632
Same thing,
a peach yogurt drink.

01:00:02.800 --> 01:00:05.554
But today, she drank it all
right there from the fridge.

01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.677
Must have been thirsty.

01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320
You got anything?

01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:29.631
<i>Yeah,
she went to school. Got nauseous in class.</i>

01:00:29.760 --> 01:00:31.200
Now she's on her way
to the bathroom.

01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:32.360
Call for back-up.

01:00:32.560 --> 01:00:33.835
<i>I'm coming right now.</i>

01:00:53.120 --> 01:00:54.120
Shh!

01:01:08.440 --> 01:01:09.556
Shh.

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:15.476
Here, Kim. Drink this.

01:01:15.640 --> 01:01:17.711
I put something in the yogurt
to make you nauseous.

01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:19.599
This will take it away.

01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:27.430
Hi, baby.

01:01:27.880 --> 01:01:28.880
Hi.

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:34.957
Oh, Kim. Kim.

01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:38.594
Oh, Kim.

01:01:39.920 --> 01:01:42.276
Daddy. I don't know what to do.

01:01:43.440 --> 01:01:44.635
I'm pregnant.

01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080
What?

01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:53.078
I'm pregnant.

01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:58.590
Dad?

01:01:58.720 --> 01:01:59.720
I'm okay.

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:03.840
I have low blood sugar.

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.832
I haven't eaten since yesterday.

01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:07.400
Um...

01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.680
Eat this.

01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.591
Don't you worry.

01:02:26.800 --> 01:02:28.871
Let's get through
this first and then...

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.794
we'll figure out
what's best for...

01:02:32.280 --> 01:02:34.272
What you have to do
is act natural.

01:02:34.440 --> 01:02:35.954
This cop is really smart.

01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:37.634
Anything out of the usual...

01:02:37.800 --> 01:02:40.269
he'll become suspicious. Okay?

01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:44.119
I love you.

01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:45.959
I love you, too.

01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.798
<i>Yes.</i> Where are you?

01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:00.354
I'm in the science building.
East wing.

01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:01.520
<i>She's in the bathroom.</i>

01:03:01.640 --> 01:03:03.233
Don't move. Wait for me.

01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:10.514
Where are you staying?

01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:12.473
I'm still at Mom's.

01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:15.190
I started packing her stuff.

01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:18.674
It doesn't feel real.

01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:20.194
Oh, I know.

01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:22.433
I know.

01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.673
Dad, there's...

01:03:31.200 --> 01:03:32.714
Stuart's been acting
really weird.

01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:34.633
He must be scared
about something.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.359
He hired bodyguards.

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:39.840
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.520
It was so much fun.
But you know what?

01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:43.512
- He was such a jerk.
- Really?

01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:45.400
He made me pay for my own drink at the bar.

01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.201
I was wearing something
more skimpy than this.

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.401
More skimpy than that?
I don't know what was happening.

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:53.874
Maybe he's blind. I don't know.

01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:55.156
I don't know.

01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:02.555
He is such a jerk.

01:04:02.720 --> 01:04:03.720
I'm not gonna do
it again, though.

01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:04.960
No, it's cool, I've seen him.

01:04:05.080 --> 01:04:06.196
I completely understand.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:08.471
He's hot, right?

01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:16.234
- Go, go, go!
- I'm going!

01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400
Go, go, go.

01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:28.960
What the...?

01:04:29.080 --> 01:04:30.080
Excuse me?

01:04:31.920 --> 01:04:32.920
Perv!

01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:35.760
He just left.

01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:39.914
She's in the can.

01:04:41.920 --> 01:04:43.434
I can't let you leave.

01:04:47.120 --> 01:04:48.120
Seal all the areas.

01:04:53.320 --> 01:04:54.356
Hey!

01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:07.270
There he is.

01:05:07.640 --> 01:05:08.790
Down the south corridor!

01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:09.996
Freeze!

01:05:25.960 --> 01:05:27.474
Go, go, go!

01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360
Move!

01:05:37.480 --> 01:05:39.153
Just move! Come on!

01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:40.836
This way! Move, move!

01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.751
I know you think
you're helping him...

01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920
but you're not.

01:06:17.680 --> 01:06:18.680
You're not.

01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:20.354
Unless we get him to come in...

01:06:20.520 --> 01:06:22.830
I can't start trying to make
sense of what happened.

01:06:23.280 --> 01:06:25.351
Someone killed my mom.

01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:27.194
That's what happened.

01:06:27.400 --> 01:06:29.869
It was not my father.

01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:31.429
Without hearing
his side of the story,

01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.760
they can't know that, can they?

01:06:32.920 --> 01:06:34.036
I do.

01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:38.509
Is there anything else?

01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:39.870
You know we can arrest you

01:06:39.960 --> 01:06:42.031
for obstructing
an ongoing investigation?

01:06:43.560 --> 01:06:44.710
Arrest me.

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:47.916
Rather not.

01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.672
Well, then,
if you're not going to,

01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.955
can I go home?

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:54.437
Of course. Of course.

01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:01.030
Thank you.

01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:11.639
Interesting family.

01:07:15.760 --> 01:07:17.319
<i>Don't worry,</i>

01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.960
<i>we will take care of this.
Do as we planned.</i>

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:21.955
Call the car.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:23.679
Where are we going, boss?

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:24.910
The Malibu house.

01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:47.957
Okay, let's go get drunk.

01:10:09.160 --> 01:10:10.160
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:10:10.360 --> 01:10:12.750
I need a ride. Mind if I drive?

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.195
Okay.

01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:27.636
What's your name?

01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:28.756
Mike.

01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:32.359
I'm Bryan. You have kids, Mike?

01:10:32.440 --> 01:10:33.635
Yeah, two. Uh-huh.

01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:37.518
How old?
Owen is three, and Tori is seven.

01:10:37.600 --> 01:10:38.600
Great age.

01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.394
A piece of advice.
Don't miss a day of it.

01:10:42.160 --> 01:10:45.551
Before you know it,
they'll be having kids of their own.

01:10:45.640 --> 01:10:46.710
Know what I mean?

01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:00.670
Thanks, Mike.

01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:10.437
Uh-huh.
You know, if you stand in a field

01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:12.432
with a book of matches...

01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:15.798
you can have hundreds
of rabbits in seconds...

01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:17.195
like this.

01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.510
You know how? No.

01:11:24.160 --> 01:11:25.514
Come in, all rabbits.

01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.640
Come in, all rabbits.
You like this?

01:13:52.360 --> 01:13:53.589
Who hired you?

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:56.750
Huh?

01:13:58.680 --> 01:14:00.000
Who are you working for?

01:14:01.280 --> 01:14:02.509
Your accent is shit!

01:14:02.800 --> 01:14:04.439
Who are you working for?

01:14:05.760 --> 01:14:07.592
I'd rather die than tell you.

01:14:08.720 --> 01:14:09.915
Scumbag!

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:33.878
Boss? They're at the gate.

01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:35.316
Let them in.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
Oh, and take a stroll.

01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:39.234
I need a little privacy.

01:14:59.400 --> 01:15:00.754
Many?

01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:02.875
Many?

01:15:31.520 --> 01:15:32.749
Oh!

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.160
Bryan?

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:01.517
None of this is making sense to me,
Stuart.

01:16:03.520 --> 01:16:05.398
I was hoping
you could help me out.

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.710
How did you...

01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:09.792
Survive the crash?

01:16:13.920 --> 01:16:16.640
<i>The Russians who were following
me when I was following you...</i>

01:16:16.840 --> 01:16:18.000
do they work for you, Stuart?

01:16:18.160 --> 01:16:20.197
No.
I don't know what you're talking about.

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:21.480
What do you know?

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:23.841
The only thing I know is that
you were fucking my wife.

01:16:24.240 --> 01:16:26.232
And I know that she's dead!

01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:27.436
No, no, no!

01:16:39.680 --> 01:16:40.716
What do you know?

01:16:40.880 --> 01:16:42.360
I don't know anything.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.352
I swear. I don't know anything.

01:16:44.800 --> 01:16:46.075
If I believed that,
we wouldn't be here.

01:16:46.240 --> 01:16:47.674
No! No! No!

01:16:50.920 --> 01:16:52.593
Malankov, Malankov, Malankov!

01:16:53.320 --> 01:16:54.549
What?

01:16:54.720 --> 01:16:55.720
Malankov.

01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.230
Oleg Malankov.

01:16:58.600 --> 01:16:59.636
Who is Oleg Malankov?

01:16:59.840 --> 01:17:01.240
I owe him money.

01:17:01.400 --> 01:17:02.470
You don't know him.

01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:06.397
He'll never give up.
It's only a game for him.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:09.240
I lost everything.
He said he'd kill my family.

01:17:09.400 --> 01:17:10.959
Why didn't you tell
this to the police?

01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:12.200
You let them think it was me.

01:17:12.240 --> 01:17:13.310
I was angry with you.

01:17:13.520 --> 01:17:14.749
God damn it, you promised!

01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:15.956
You promised to stop seeing her!

01:17:16.120 --> 01:17:17.320
So what do you think happened?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.555
She came over to my place.

01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:20.359
This Malankov
followed her there?

01:17:20.760 --> 01:17:21.989
If you weren't seeing her
behind my back...

01:17:22.160 --> 01:17:23.958
she wouldn't have been there
in the first place, would she?

01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.760
They would have killed her
someplace else.

01:17:25.920 --> 01:17:27.434
So why are they coming after me?

01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:30.471
Because I told them
who you were.

01:17:30.640 --> 01:17:33.439
That you would find them
and kill them.

01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:35.751
How convenient
would that be for you?

01:17:35.960 --> 01:17:37.952
I kill them,
your debt is cancelled.

01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:40.599
I'm sorry, Bryan.

01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.951
But I loved her.
You gotta believe me.

01:17:43.120 --> 01:17:45.271
I loved her! I loved her!

01:17:45.440 --> 01:17:47.113
Here's what you're gonna do.

01:17:47.280 --> 01:17:49.954
You're gonna go to the police
and tell them everything.

01:17:50.840 --> 01:17:52.035
I can't.

01:17:52.200 --> 01:17:54.476
I can't. He's crazy.
You don't know him.

01:17:54.640 --> 01:17:57.712
You can do whatever the hell you want.
Either way...

01:17:58.000 --> 01:17:59.639
I'm a dead man.

01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:00.950
I'm dead.

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:02.873
They kill you,
they don't get paid.

01:18:03.400 --> 01:18:06.154
You're not the one they're
gonna come after next.

01:18:08.680 --> 01:18:09.955
Kim.

01:18:31.160 --> 01:18:32.160
Hey.

01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:34.310
Can I get your keys, please?

01:18:36.200 --> 01:18:37.873
Do you know what you're
getting yourself into, man?

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.280
Yeah. As a matter
of fact, I do.

01:18:39.440 --> 01:18:41.200
Could I get your keys
and your phone, please?

01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:47.196
You mind putting your
hands on the steering wheel?

01:18:48.240 --> 01:18:50.357
Or what?
What are you gonna do? Shoot me?

01:18:51.840 --> 01:18:52.840
Left or right?

01:18:54.920 --> 01:18:56.036
Go ahead, put the cuffs on.

01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:06.752
Thank you very much.

01:19:41.400 --> 01:19:43.119
Dad!

01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:45.794
Let's go, Kim.

01:19:49.840 --> 01:19:51.194
What's going on?

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:52.396
We're keeping you safe.

01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:55.276
Sam?

01:19:55.360 --> 01:19:56.880
Hey, Kim. We're gonna
get in the truck.

01:19:57.200 --> 01:19:58.236
Hi, Kim.

01:20:01.400 --> 01:20:02.470
Let's go.

01:20:08.400 --> 01:20:09.880
<i>Bernard Harris.</i>

01:20:10.480 --> 01:20:12.437
He's a trained sniper.

01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:15.356
Left the army at 24.

01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:16.840
Nothing, nothing after that.

01:20:17.080 --> 01:20:21.313
Nothing until he registers
as one of three founders

01:20:21.400 --> 01:20:23.960
of something called Private
Securities International.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:28.392
The other two being, Casey Mark,

01:20:28.480 --> 01:20:32.110
Navy SEAL, eight years' service.

01:20:32.200 --> 01:20:33.759
"Explosives expert."
It's right there.

01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:37.831
Next time we hear
from him, he's 45

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.754
and Senior Vice President

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:43.230
of Private Securities
International.

01:20:44.560 --> 01:20:46.836
Sam Grossman,
communications expert,

01:20:46.920 --> 01:20:48.991
a wizard,

01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:54.712
and he's the COO of Private
Securities International.

01:20:55.320 --> 01:20:59.678
Now, our primary person
of interest...

01:21:02.880 --> 01:21:04.758
Bryan Mills.

01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:11.558
Is listed as an "employee"
of Private...

01:21:11.640 --> 01:21:12.790
You get the picture.

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:18.352
These are very serious people.

01:21:18.440 --> 01:21:20.875
If you don't bring your A-game,

01:21:20.960 --> 01:21:23.429
they're gonna run around you,
through you, under you.

01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:26.274
I need it to stop right now.

01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:29.510
There's one more thing. This.

01:21:36.160 --> 01:21:38.470
The Russian, he killed himself.

01:21:39.120 --> 01:21:41.032
Probably because he didn't
wanna give up the information

01:21:41.120 --> 01:21:42.793
that Mills was asking him for.

01:21:42.880 --> 01:21:46.556
Because obviously,
he's not trying to kill you.

01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:50.190
Obviously, he's not
trying to kill anybody.

01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.193
He's only trying
to get information.

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.476
He's only trying to figure this out,
just like we are.

01:21:55.560 --> 01:21:58.837
Except for the fact that
he is a step ahead of us.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:02.391
I'd like to know the relationship
between the Russians

01:22:02.520 --> 01:22:05.194
and the wife's murder.

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.433
One of these four people,
they know something about it.

01:22:08.520 --> 01:22:10.352
They know the answer.

01:22:11.520 --> 01:22:12.715
I need you guys to find them.

01:22:12.800 --> 01:22:15.713
I need you to bring them in.

01:22:24.880 --> 01:22:26.234
- Anything yet?
- No.

01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:28.710
Nothing came up from the
samples you gave me.

01:22:28.920 --> 01:22:30.320
But this is gonna take
a while to sort through.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.437
Bryan, there's a shitload
of data here.

01:22:32.600 --> 01:22:34.000
What is that?

01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:36.392
I downloaded
the police computers.

01:22:36.600 --> 01:22:38.841
For what? BRYAN:
The first thing they're gonna look at...

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:41.071
are the phone records to
see if there are any clues.

01:22:41.240 --> 01:22:42.310
Mine and Lenore's.

01:22:42.480 --> 01:22:43.596
What's it gonna tell you,

01:22:43.680 --> 01:22:45.241
that you and Lenore
spoke to each other?

01:22:45.320 --> 01:22:46.640
You know what?
Don't worry about it.

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:48.120
We're almost done here anyway.

01:22:48.280 --> 01:22:49.680
So, what's the plan?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:51.752
The plan is to make sure
my daughter is safe.

01:22:51.920 --> 01:22:53.912
And the only way
to do that, so it seems...

01:22:54.080 --> 01:22:56.311
is to eliminate the thing
that will make her unsafe.

01:22:56.720 --> 01:22:57.915
Malankov.

01:22:58.080 --> 01:22:59.799
Good one, Stuart.

01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:01.914
I'd like to help.

01:23:02.120 --> 01:23:03.520
Oh, you're
gonna help, all right.

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:05.160
Like bait helps
to catch a shark.

01:23:05.320 --> 01:23:06.515
Excuse me?

01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.273
Start talking about Malankov.

01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:09.874
I want to know every detail.

01:23:10.040 --> 01:23:11.997
Who he is, what he does,
where he lives...

01:23:12.160 --> 01:23:13.435
where he works.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:16.156
Oleg Malankov.

01:23:17.440 --> 01:23:18.954
He's as tough as they come.

01:23:20.800 --> 01:23:22.280
<i>He served in the Russian Army</i>

01:23:22.360 --> 01:23:23.919
<i>when they invaded Afghanistan.</i>

01:23:27.760 --> 01:23:29.035
<i>He was</i> Spetsnaz.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:31.000
<i>It's like our Navy SEALS.</i>

01:23:31.920 --> 01:23:33.752
<i>After the collapse
of the Soviet Union,</i>

01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.433
<i>when everyone was
grabbing what they could...</i>

01:23:35.600 --> 01:23:37.034
<i>there was a real demand</i>

01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:38.440
<i>for men with his kind of skills.</i>

01:23:38.600 --> 01:23:40.353
<i>He became one of the grabbers.</i>

01:23:47.520 --> 01:23:48.840
<i>I met him
when I was doing a deal</i>

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:50.713
<i>involving heavy machinery.</i>

01:23:50.920 --> 01:23:52.195
<i>Since then, we did business</i>

01:23:52.280 --> 01:23:53.714
<i>on a number
of different occasions.</i>

01:23:54.920 --> 01:23:56.115
<i>Some deals worked out.</i>

01:23:58.840 --> 01:24:00.354
I don't have the money.

01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:06.120
Last one didn't.

01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.470
What?

01:24:10.280 --> 01:24:13.273
My mom is dead because of one
of your shitty business deals?

01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:14.400
No.

01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:15.880
Kim, that's not what happened.

01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:17.596
Fuck you!

01:24:17.800 --> 01:24:21.316
I'll fucking kill you! Kim.

01:24:21.480 --> 01:24:22.516
We need him.

01:24:24.160 --> 01:24:25.276
We need him.

01:24:31.440 --> 01:24:32.440
Call him.

01:24:32.800 --> 01:24:33.870
Why?

01:24:34.040 --> 01:24:35.560
Because you're gonna
set him up for me.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.200
Make the call. Now.

01:24:41.360 --> 01:24:42.396
On speaker.

01:24:50.040 --> 01:24:51.554
Pow.

01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:06.434
Stuart. I've missed you.

01:25:06.600 --> 01:25:07.600
I have your money.

01:25:07.760 --> 01:25:08.760
<i>You have it?</i>

01:25:09.080 --> 01:25:10.434
<i>That was fast.</i>

01:25:10.600 --> 01:25:11.750
How can I trust you?

01:25:11.960 --> 01:25:13.280
<i>You can trust me.</i>

01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:15.274
Where do you want me
to bring it?

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:17.716
Meet me at the building
downtown.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:18.990
<i>In one hour.</i>

01:25:20.160 --> 01:25:22.391
Sure, one hour.

01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:23.480
Scumbag!

01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:25.913
Tell me how his security works.

01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:29.912
<i>Malankov works out
of his penthouse apartment.</i>

01:25:32.080 --> 01:25:34.072
<i>He has a private elevator
with two bodyguards.</i>

01:25:34.440 --> 01:25:36.113
Malankov is coming.
Send the elevator.

01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.839
<i>The elevator is controlled</i>

01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:39.513
<i>by security upstairs.</i>

01:25:40.080 --> 01:25:42.440
<i>Once they see who's inside the
elevator and give the okay...</i>

01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:43.800
<i>they will send the elevator up.</i>

01:25:45.440 --> 01:25:47.432
<i>Outside the elevator,
upstairs...</i>

01:25:47.600 --> 01:25:50.911
<i>is a security station
and three more bodyguards.</i>

01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:52.830
<i>Two sets of doors.</i>

01:25:53.440 --> 01:25:54.999
<i>Through the second set of doors</i>

01:25:55.080 --> 01:25:56.878
<i>is Malankov's private apartment.</i>

01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:12.390
Can you help me out, here?

01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.472
I got an address
but I don't have a name.

01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.994
I got a back
full of perishables.

01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:17.640
Go to the first floor
and ask for the desk.

01:26:17.800 --> 01:26:19.040
First floor. Thank you so much.

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.120
You're welcome.

01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:35.276
Hello, sir.

01:26:35.360 --> 01:26:36.840
I'm here to see Oleg Malankov.

01:26:37.040 --> 01:26:38.360
Okay, sir, have a good day.

01:26:38.520 --> 01:26:39.520
Thanks.

01:26:51.360 --> 01:26:52.680
Get out.

01:27:14.600 --> 01:27:15.600
It's Dotzler.

01:27:15.680 --> 01:27:16.875
Answer it. Act normal.

01:27:17.080 --> 01:27:18.958
Don't try anything smart.

01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.674
- Hello?
<i>- Mr. St. John?</i>

01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:22.030
Frank Dotzler.

01:27:22.200 --> 01:27:23.270
Where are you?

01:27:23.440 --> 01:27:24.715
Um, I'm in a business meeting.

01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:25.956
Is there anything wrong?

01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:28.271
Bryan Mills removed your
stepdaughter from your home.

01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.476
<i>I'm there right now.</i>

01:27:29.720 --> 01:27:31.234
Oh, my God. That's, um...

01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:32.400
<i>When are you coming home?</i>

01:27:32.480 --> 01:27:33.550
I'm leaving immediately.

01:27:33.720 --> 01:27:35.916
<i>It should take me about an hour
to get there from where I am.</i>

01:27:36.080 --> 01:27:38.356
Where exactly is that? Malibu.

01:27:38.560 --> 01:27:41.917
Listen, Inspector,
I don't think he means her any harm.

01:27:42.080 --> 01:27:44.231
Mr. St. John, this man
is the prime suspect

01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:45.760
in the murder of your wife.

01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.151
His associates
held guns on my men

01:27:48.280 --> 01:27:50.237
in the front of your home.

01:27:50.400 --> 01:27:51.720
As far as I'm concerned,
he is dangerous

01:27:51.800 --> 01:27:53.080
<i>and has to be
taken into custody.</i>

01:27:53.240 --> 01:27:54.469
So, if you'd like,
I can send a car for you,

01:27:54.560 --> 01:27:55.789
but I need you somewhere safe.

01:27:55.960 --> 01:27:58.270
No, no, no. It's fine.

01:27:58.440 --> 01:28:00.079
I'm leaving right now.

01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.993
I'll be waiting for you.

01:28:07.840 --> 01:28:10.275
Get me a location
on St. John's phone.

01:28:10.440 --> 01:28:11.999
As soon as he finds
out you're not in Malibu,

01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.161
he'll be headed right here.

01:28:13.320 --> 01:28:14.800
I'd say we have

01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:16.917
less than 30 minutes to do
this before he shows up.

01:28:17.080 --> 01:28:18.150
It's enough time for me.

01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:19.390
Can you handle this, Kim?

01:28:19.600 --> 01:28:20.750
What do I have to do?

01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:22.521
Just keep me up to
date on what comes up.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:23.676
Thanks, Sam.

01:28:25.240 --> 01:28:27.675
Inspector, the tape you gave
us from that gas station...

01:28:27.840 --> 01:28:29.593
here are the stills,
frame by frame.

01:28:34.120 --> 01:28:35.120
Hey.

01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.680
He lied to you
about where he was.

01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:38.752
What a surprise. He's downtown.

01:28:38.920 --> 01:28:40.036
Let's call out the cavalry.

01:28:40.120 --> 01:28:41.120
All right.

01:28:41.480 --> 01:28:42.561
We're out of this location!

01:28:42.680 --> 01:28:44.956
We're on the move! Let's go!

01:28:50.480 --> 01:28:51.596
They're gone.

01:28:51.800 --> 01:28:53.439
Okay. Cops on the move.

01:28:53.840 --> 01:28:55.115
Okay. Let's go.

01:28:56.520 --> 01:28:58.352
You do exactly as you were told.

01:28:58.440 --> 01:28:59.510
Don't improvise.

01:28:59.680 --> 01:29:01.672
Try anything funny,
and they'll kill you.

01:29:01.840 --> 01:29:03.797
And if they don't, I will.

01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:22.797
I don't know how many times
I can say sorry.

01:29:29.800 --> 01:29:30.800
Come here, Kim.

01:29:34.080 --> 01:29:35.080
There.

01:29:44.320 --> 01:29:45.320
Dotzler.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.880
I found out something
you might wanna know.

01:29:47.120 --> 01:29:50.318
<i>Matching insurance policies
on St. John and his wife.</i>

01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.392
$12 million. Each.

01:29:52.720 --> 01:29:54.712
<i>How about that?</i>

01:30:03.360 --> 01:30:06.194
Stuart St. John.
Mr. Malankov's expecting me.

01:30:06.680 --> 01:30:07.716
What's in the bag?

01:30:13.120 --> 01:30:14.120
We're in.

01:30:17.799 --> 01:30:18.799
Okay.

01:30:18.800 --> 01:30:22.680
Stuart St. John is clear.
Unlock the elevator.

01:30:28.560 --> 01:30:29.789
Okay.

01:30:30.480 --> 01:30:31.800
Got him.

01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:34.440
Go! All right.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:35.874
What's going on?

01:30:36.560 --> 01:30:37.560
Everything okay?

01:30:44.720 --> 01:30:45.756
Mmm-hmm.

01:30:47.280 --> 01:30:48.475
Call the elevator.

01:30:55.640 --> 01:30:56.640
Get back to the truck.

01:31:06.680 --> 01:31:07.750
Bingo.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:09.875
Right on.

01:31:21.800 --> 01:31:23.314
Mmm.

01:31:31.600 --> 01:31:33.239
He's coming up.

01:31:34.360 --> 01:31:36.431
Go, go, go.

01:31:36.600 --> 01:31:38.114
Showtime. Bingo.

01:31:38.840 --> 01:31:40.513
What the hell's going on?

01:31:46.600 --> 01:31:47.600
Guys?

01:31:57.160 --> 01:31:58.389
Go check it out.

01:35:11.680 --> 01:35:12.750
Get up.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:15.920
Get up!

01:35:47.040 --> 01:35:48.997
Who are you, old man?

01:35:49.160 --> 01:35:51.231
You killed my ex-wife.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.831
But you're not gonna
kill my daughter.

01:35:58.560 --> 01:35:59.560
Your daughter?

01:36:01.440 --> 01:36:02.440
Shit!

01:36:03.960 --> 01:36:06.031
We are fucked by the same man.

01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.794
What are you talking about?

01:36:08.960 --> 01:36:10.758
Stuart St. John.

01:36:12.280 --> 01:36:14.431
First, he gets me
to kill your wife...

01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:15.636
then you.

01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:18.556
And when that doesn't work...

01:36:18.720 --> 01:36:21.360
he pushes you to kill me, no?

01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:24.513
Either way, he wins.

01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.071
Your wife was just
part of a business deal...

01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:32.517
like many before her.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:37.632
It is my turn to lose the game.

01:36:37.720 --> 01:36:38.756
Finish me!

01:36:39.480 --> 01:36:41.199
Finish me.

01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:43.679
I deserve it.

01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.314
Yes.

01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:52.275
You do.

01:37:29.200 --> 01:37:30.350
Dad?

01:37:30.560 --> 01:37:31.676
<i>Listen.</i>

01:37:33.840 --> 01:37:35.240
- Dad?
- What is it, Kim?

01:37:35.400 --> 01:37:36.400
No! Ahhh!

01:37:36.640 --> 01:37:37.869
Sam! Sam!

01:37:38.240 --> 01:37:39.240
Kim.

01:37:39.400 --> 01:37:40.595
Come on. Let's go.

01:37:41.480 --> 01:37:42.800
<i>Come on. Move.</i> Kim!

01:37:46.120 --> 01:37:47.395
Get in the car!

01:37:47.560 --> 01:37:48.560
Let's go, come on!

01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:51.070
Where are we going?

01:37:51.240 --> 01:37:52.310
Get in the car.

01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:25.753
He's still alive.
Let's get a medic in here...

01:38:25.960 --> 01:38:27.952
<i>ASAP! Medic!</i>

01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:29.680
Inspector!

01:38:29.760 --> 01:38:31.319
Yeah? The elevator!

01:38:31.480 --> 01:38:32.480
Dotzler, it's Smith.

01:38:32.560 --> 01:38:33.720
<i>We're in Malankov's building.</i>

01:38:33.760 --> 01:38:35.433
<i>I think, uh, Mills is here.</i>
Really?

01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:37.240
Yeah. We're gonna check
the apartment now.

01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:41.800
Shit!

01:38:42.920 --> 01:38:44.320
Hey! Can you move?

01:38:55.080 --> 01:38:56.594
Back it up. Back it up.

01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:07.720
All right, let's go.
Everybody in.

01:39:07.800 --> 01:39:09.120
Come on! Let's go!

01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:28.880
This guy's still warm.

01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.320
We got a good chance
he's still in the building.

01:39:30.440 --> 01:39:31.794
Call downstairs, lock it up.

01:39:31.880 --> 01:39:33.553
Nobody in, nobody out.

01:39:41.720 --> 01:39:43.552
Lock it up.
Nobody in, nobody out.

01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:18.474
<i>"Text from your phone
asking Mom to meet you..."</i>

01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:20.393
<i>"at the Rancho Berrego
the night she died."</i>

01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:22.040
<i>"Someone used your phone?"</i>

01:40:36.320 --> 01:40:37.436
Call Dotzler!

01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:48.229
<i>Santa Monica Aviation.</i>

01:40:48.320 --> 01:40:49.356
This is Mr. St. John.

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:51.790
I'll be there in 15 minutes.
Get the plane ready.

01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:52.960
<i>It'll be ready.</i>

01:40:55.680 --> 01:40:56.955
Why are you doing this?

01:40:58.520 --> 01:41:00.113
Because your father
and his friends

01:41:00.240 --> 01:41:01.469
are homicidal maniacs.

01:41:01.640 --> 01:41:03.359
You're a lying piece of shit.
Shut up.

01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:04.556
You killed her! I know...

01:41:04.800 --> 01:41:05.995
You shut up!

01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:07.316
Shut up!

01:41:11.800 --> 01:41:12.995
Brooks.

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:14.560
I want the full work-up
on a black Porsche,

01:41:14.640 --> 01:41:17.599
license plate number
6-8-9-M-J-C-6.

01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:18.680
Okay.

01:41:18.800 --> 01:41:20.200
<i>Connect me to the Porsche
phone and trace it.</i>

01:41:20.280 --> 01:41:21.280
All right.

01:41:23.960 --> 01:41:25.553
I need a run on
a California plate

01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:27.637
6-8-9-Mary-Jane-Charlie-6.

01:41:27.800 --> 01:41:28.800
I need a phone, too.

01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:40.160
Pick up the phone.

01:41:42.360 --> 01:41:43.680
<i>Black Porsche's
phone position received.</i>

01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:44.840
<i>Heading west.</i>

01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:47.993
Yes?

01:41:48.280 --> 01:41:49.396
Listen, Mr. Mills.

01:41:49.560 --> 01:41:50.596
<i>It's Dotzler.</i>

01:41:50.680 --> 01:41:52.320
I've started to piece
this thing together.

01:41:52.480 --> 01:41:54.836
<i>There's two
life insurance policies.</i>

01:41:55.040 --> 01:41:56.679
One for St. John,
one for your ex-wife.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:41:58.519
<i>You understand?</i>

01:41:59.520 --> 01:42:01.079
Stuart owed money
to these Russians.

01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:02.276
<i>A lot of it.</i>

01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:03.400
The ones who abducted her.

01:42:03.520 --> 01:42:04.840
Then they took her to my place

01:42:04.920 --> 01:42:06.521
and killed her to
keep me out of the way.

01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.080
I need you to step back...

01:42:09.240 --> 01:42:10.469
and allow me to handle this.

01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:11.680
<i>I got it.</i>

01:42:11.840 --> 01:42:13.593
What's your first
priority here, Inspector?

01:42:15.040 --> 01:42:16.235
To arrest St. John

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:17.960
and charge him
with your ex-wife's murder.

01:42:19.040 --> 01:42:21.680
My first priority
is my daughter.

01:42:40.560 --> 01:42:41.560
Get out of the car.

01:42:42.520 --> 01:42:43.556
Come on, let's go.

01:42:45.760 --> 01:42:46.796
Go!

01:42:54.200 --> 01:42:56.237
Okay, we're leaving now.
Come on, let's go.

01:42:56.440 --> 01:42:57.440
Yes, sir!

01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:04.560
Approaching Runway Two.

01:43:04.640 --> 01:43:05.915
Ready for takeoff.

01:43:06.080 --> 01:43:07.480
Come on, guys. Let's go.

01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:08.961
Requesting
permission for takeoff.

01:43:10.760 --> 01:43:12.672
<i>We got a visual on the Porsche.</i>

01:43:12.760 --> 01:43:14.752
<i>He's heading to
Santa Monica airport.</i>

01:43:22.160 --> 01:43:24.755
I want all units in the area
of the Santa Monica airport...

01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:26.957
to be on the lookout
for a black Porsche.

01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:48.480
No.

01:43:56.040 --> 01:43:57.040
Let's go!

01:44:05.600 --> 01:44:07.273
- Come on!
- We don't have enough speed!

01:44:08.800 --> 01:44:09.800
Let's go!

01:44:26.680 --> 01:44:27.716
Give me the goddamn gun!

01:44:30.040 --> 01:44:31.394
Give me the goddamn gun!

01:44:34.520 --> 01:44:36.512
I'll shoot you in the head!

01:44:36.680 --> 01:44:37.716
Shut up!

01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.196
Very smart...

01:44:57.040 --> 01:44:58.554
playing me off
against the Russian.

01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:01.875
Coming over for coffee.

01:45:02.040 --> 01:45:04.600
Taking my phone,
sending texts and then erasing them.

01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.400
So that your pals...

01:45:12.560 --> 01:45:13.681
could plant Lenore's body...

01:45:13.840 --> 01:45:15.240
and make it look
as if I killed her.

01:45:22.040 --> 01:45:23.235
All your problems solved.

01:45:23.720 --> 01:45:25.279
All your worries over.

01:45:25.680 --> 01:45:27.717
But it didn't quite
work out that way.

01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:31.592
Oh, listen, Bryan.

01:45:32.400 --> 01:45:33.516
They're coming.

01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:37.272
You can't kill me now.

01:45:41.400 --> 01:45:43.073
Oh, yeah?

01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:45.240
Dad...

01:45:51.080 --> 01:45:53.311
I know you know
a lot of people...

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.281
and with a good lawyer,
you'll get out of jail

01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:56.436
in a few years.

01:45:56.600 --> 01:45:58.910
And then I'll come for you.

01:45:59.120 --> 01:46:01.077
I'll find you.

01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:02.754
And we both know
what's gonna happen.

01:46:51.320 --> 01:46:53.880
<i>I knew from the beginning.</i>

01:46:55.320 --> 01:46:57.152
It was the bagels.

01:46:57.880 --> 01:46:59.678
They were warm.

01:46:59.840 --> 01:47:00.876
I had to ask myself...

01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:04.670
what kind of guy
goes out for warm bagels...

01:47:04.840 --> 01:47:07.150
and comes back
and commits murder?

01:47:07.320 --> 01:47:11.155
So, I compared the timestamps
to the deleted texts...

01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:14.316
that you downloaded
from our computers.

01:47:15.480 --> 01:47:17.880
Which, by the way, is illegal,
and I could arrest you for it.

01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:20.675
I could. But it's got me.

01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:23.796
And I was able to figure it out.

01:47:24.840 --> 01:47:25.840
She was leaving him.

01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:29.514
He needed the insurance money
to pay Malankov.

01:47:30.520 --> 01:47:32.280
You didn't help us out
by escaping, you know.

01:47:33.520 --> 01:47:35.273
He figured, what better way

01:47:35.360 --> 01:47:37.480
to get rid of Malankov and
keep the insurance money...

01:47:38.760 --> 01:47:40.080
than by getting me

01:47:40.160 --> 01:47:42.038
to kill the guy
who would kill him...

01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:45.832
because it was the only way
to keep my daughter safe.

01:47:47.040 --> 01:47:48.360
Almost worked.

01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:50.673
Almost.

01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.194
So, are we done, Inspector?

01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.040
Of course.

01:47:59.200 --> 01:48:00.236
Of course we're done.

01:48:04.120 --> 01:48:05.120
We're done.

01:48:07.920 --> 01:48:09.070
Could you, um,

01:48:09.160 --> 01:48:10.719
just stay in town
for the next month or so...

01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:12.800
just in case I have any
other questions for you?

01:48:13.920 --> 01:48:14.920
Sure.

01:48:48.920 --> 01:48:50.274
Now, you two.

01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:52.471
I've thought
about this all night.

01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.952
It's a very important choice.

01:48:56.600 --> 01:48:57.954
Whatever you decide...

01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:00.840
the two of you, together...

01:49:03.280 --> 01:49:05.272
I'll support you 100%.

01:49:06.240 --> 01:49:09.631
And I know your mom would have
said the same thing, too.

01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.153
Tell him. Dad...

01:49:14.600 --> 01:49:16.114
we've been talking.

01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:18.358
We thought that...

01:49:18.840 --> 01:49:19.910
if it's a girl...

01:49:21.680 --> 01:49:24.275
we'd like to name her after mom.

01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:33.351
She'd like that very much, Kim.

01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:50.037
<i>Hot nights coming.</i>

01:49:54.280 --> 01:49:57.717
<i>Keep the car running.</i>

01:50:01.720 --> 01:50:05.509
<i>Lavender fingers.</i>

01:50:09.440 --> 01:50:13.320
<i>Swallow my pollen.</i>

01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:21.116
<i>Gold, I swam into your spell.</i>

01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.955
<i>On the rite of God we fell.</i>

01:50:25.040 --> 01:50:28.670
<i>You were plush and I laid bare.</i>

01:50:28.760 --> 01:50:31.434
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:36.476
<i>Cold, I fell into your skin.</i>

01:50:36.560 --> 01:50:41.157
<i>On the night
you led me under your sin.</i>

01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:44.711
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:50:45.240 --> 01:50:48.153
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:51:20.760 --> 01:51:24.640
<i>Golden siren.</i>

01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:31.990
<i>Under-exposing.</i>

01:51:35.640 --> 01:51:40.715
<i>Come lay your weakness down.</i>

01:51:42.760 --> 01:51:47.596
<i>On the floor in the backseat.</i>

01:51:50.520 --> 01:51:55.197
<i>Gold, I swam into your spell.</i>

01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:59.069
<i>On the rite of God we fell.</i>

01:51:59.160 --> 01:52:02.915
<i>You were plush and I laid bare.</i>

01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:05.834
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:52:05.920 --> 01:52:10.676
<i>Cold, I fell into your skin.</i>

01:52:10.760 --> 01:52:15.277
<i>On the night
you led me under your sin.</i>

01:52:15.360 --> 01:52:18.831
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:22.671
<i>You had me howling.</i>

01:52:23.680 --> 01:52:27.560
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:35.280
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:42.954
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:52:46.720 --> 01:52:50.999
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:13.720
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:53:17.600 --> 01:53:21.674
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:53:25.280 --> 01:53:29.035
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:37.079
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:53:55.880 --> 01:53:59.556
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:54:03.240 --> 01:54:07.553
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:54:42.600 --> 01:54:46.230
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:54:49.800 --> 01:54:53.635
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush.</i>

01:54:57.480 --> 01:55:01.520
<i>Ooh, ooh, blush</i>
