Hey, Mom.

Oh, for crying out loud.

Well, let's get you cleaned up.

Hey, you!

01:28.797 --> 01:31.132
When Francis is home,

01:28.797 --> 01:31.132
anything we do is fun.

01:31.174 --> 01:32.509
I mean, we're

01:31.174 --> 01:32.509
just watching

01:32.551 --> 01:34.636
some stupid TV show,

01:32.551 --> 01:34.636
but it doesn't matter.

01:34.678 --> 01:35.930
This totally rules.

01:35.971 --> 01:37.305
This totally sucks!

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
Isn't there anything fun

01:37.347 --> 01:39.850
to do around here?

01:39.892 --> 01:41.602
I've got some chalk.

01:41.643 --> 01:44.145
We could draw some dead guy

01:41.643 --> 01:44.145
outlines on the sidewalk.

01:44.187 --> 01:45.188
Boring.

01:45.230 --> 01:46.189
Mom's not home.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.816
We could play

01:46.231 --> 01:47.816
cantaloupe ball.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.151
We did that last time

01:47.858 --> 01:50.151
I was home.

01:50.193 --> 01:51.653
Come on, guys, think!

01:54.907 --> 01:57.117
I'd be up for the

01:54.907 --> 01:57.117
chalk outline thing.

02:01.204 --> 02:03.164
Kitty's at the end

02:01.204 --> 02:03.164
of an ear infection.

02:03.206 --> 02:06.167
He'll need drops

02:03.206 --> 02:06.167
three times a day.

02:06.209 --> 02:07.419
Now, Jellybean

02:06.209 --> 02:07.419
likes to have

02:07.461 --> 02:10.047
a half-cup of wet food

02:07.461 --> 02:10.047
in one bowl

02:10.089 --> 02:12.382
and a half-cup of dry

02:10.089 --> 02:12.382
in another.

02:12.424 --> 02:13.550
Now, he likes the juice

02:13.592 --> 02:16.762
from the wet half

02:13.592 --> 02:16.762
poured onto the dry.

02:16.804 --> 02:18.388
Now, no overfeeding.

02:18.430 --> 02:20.181
I mean that, mister.

02:20.223 --> 02:21.600
Okay, maybe tomorrow.

02:21.642 --> 02:23.184
I can't say no to you.

02:23.226 --> 02:24.895
LOIS:

02:23.226 --> 02:24.895
Craig, can we

02:23.226 --> 02:24.895
speed things up?

02:24.937 --> 02:26.229
We've got Jellybean's

02:24.937 --> 02:26.229
emergency numbers.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.230
We know where

02:26.271 --> 02:27.230
his sweaters are.

02:27.272 --> 02:28.774
You showed us how to take

02:27.272 --> 02:28.774
his temperature.

02:28.816 --> 02:30.233
Is there anything else

02:28.816 --> 02:30.233
Dewey needs to know?

02:30.275 --> 02:32.360
I guess that's it, sport.

02:32.402 --> 02:34.237
Now, taking care

02:32.402 --> 02:34.237
of another living thing

02:34.279 --> 02:36.031
is a big responsibility.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.866
Are you sure you're up

02:36.073 --> 02:37.866
to the challenge?

02:37.908 --> 02:39.242
Mm-hmm.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
Don't worry, Craig.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
I have a feeling

02:41.244 --> 02:44.205
Dewey's going to

02:41.244 --> 02:44.205
do a great job.

02:44.247 --> 02:47.084
Great, and when

02:44.247 --> 02:47.084
the long weekend is over,

02:47.126 --> 02:49.294
you'll have earned

02:47.126 --> 02:49.294
five whole dollars.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.713
You told Mom ten.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.713
Right, ten.

02:51.755 --> 02:53.298
Aren't you a good

02:51.755 --> 02:53.298
little listener?

02:51.755 --> 02:53.298
Ow!

02:53.340 --> 02:56.135
I'm not so sure

02:53.340 --> 02:56.135
about this, Hal.

02:56.175 --> 02:57.886
Are you sure that Dewey

02:56.175 --> 02:57.886
can handle this?

02:57.928 --> 02:59.220
Aw, it's no

02:57.928 --> 02:59.220
big deal, honey.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.222
A job is a good

02:59.262 --> 03:01.222
thing for a boy.

03:01.264 --> 03:02.432
It teaches him

03:01.264 --> 03:02.432
the value of money.

03:02.474 --> 03:04.018
It gives him a little

03:02.474 --> 03:04.018
self-confidence.

03:04.059 --> 03:05.226
Besides, Craig's

03:04.059 --> 03:05.226
new place

03:05.268 --> 03:06.645
is only two blocks

03:05.268 --> 03:06.645
from our house.

03:06.687 --> 03:08.814
Hey, you can see

03:06.687 --> 03:08.814
our backyard from here.

03:08.856 --> 03:11.942
Hey... I almost forgot

03:08.856 --> 03:11.942
to show you my itinerary.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.235
Yeah, the convention lasts

03:11.984 --> 03:14.235
three days.

03:14.277 --> 03:16.321
I'll be back

03:14.277 --> 03:16.321
early Monday evening.

03:16.363 --> 03:19.867
Wow, Craig, I had no idea

03:16.363 --> 03:19.867
you were so into comic books.

03:19.908 --> 03:21.702
Well, it's not like

03:19.908 --> 03:21.702
I'm a freak about it.

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
It just helps me keep

03:21.743 --> 03:23.745
my life in perspective.

03:23.787 --> 03:25.747
You know, somehow my problems

03:23.787 --> 03:25.747
seem insignificant

03:25.789 --> 03:27.499
when compared to Richie Rich's.

03:27.541 --> 03:30.418
Well, it's time to say good-bye,

03:27.541 --> 03:30.418
Jelly Belly.

03:30.460 --> 03:33.254
Come give Daddy

03:30.460 --> 03:33.254
some kissy-kisses.

03:33.296 --> 03:34.631
(baby talk)

03:34.673 --> 03:36.466
(making noisy

03:34.673 --> 03:36.466
kissing sounds)

03:36.508 --> 03:38.259
(baby talk):

03:36.508 --> 03:38.259
I love you...

03:38.301 --> 03:39.720
Yes, I do-do-do...

03:38.301 --> 03:39.720
do-do-do-do-...

03:39.761 --> 03:42.139
(whispering):

03:39.761 --> 03:42.139
I know, son, but

03:39.761 --> 03:42.139
a job's a job.

03:42.181 --> 03:43.598
(kissing sounds continue)

03:45.308 --> 03:46.977
Big news, guys.

03:47.019 --> 03:49.688
Things are going to get a lot

03:47.019 --> 03:49.688
more interesting around here.

03:49.730 --> 03:50.438
What's up?

03:50.480 --> 03:51.857
I forget--

03:51.899 --> 03:53.942
you guys enjoy wrestling,

03:51.899 --> 03:53.942
don't you?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.360
Rage in the Cage?!

03:55.402 --> 03:56.987
Oh, my God!

03:55.402 --> 03:56.987
You're the best brother ever!

03:57.029 --> 03:58.906
We're going to have

03:57.029 --> 03:58.906
so much f...

03:58.947 --> 04:00.490
That's only two tickets.

04:00.532 --> 04:02.283
I know.

04:02.325 --> 04:04.912
How am I ever going to decide

04:02.325 --> 04:04.912
which one of you to take?

04:04.953 --> 04:08.207
You deliberately bought

04:04.953 --> 04:08.207
two tickets just to torment us?

04:08.248 --> 04:09.666
No, of course not.

04:09.708 --> 04:13.128
I bought them to see

04:09.708 --> 04:13.128
who loves me the most.

04:13.170 --> 04:15.296
Now, I know you

04:13.170 --> 04:15.296
both love me...

04:15.338 --> 04:19.300
but I bet one of you loves me

04:15.338 --> 04:19.300
just a little bit more.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.887
No. No way. We're not doing

04:19.342 --> 04:21.887
another butt-kissing contest.

04:21.929 --> 04:23.304
There's got to be

04:21.929 --> 04:23.304
another way.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.515
Okay, fine.

04:23.346 --> 04:25.515
Who's got a quarter?

04:25.557 --> 04:27.684
Here.

04:25.557 --> 04:27.684
Great.

04:27.726 --> 04:28.977
You're in the lead.

04:29.019 --> 04:31.312
Maybe you should make me

04:29.019 --> 04:31.312
a sandwich.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.732
Oh, come on, guys.

04:31.354 --> 04:33.732
It's Rage in the Cage!

04:33.774 --> 04:35.192
You should be happy!

04:35.234 --> 04:36.985
We are happy.

04:37.027 --> 04:39.654
Well, you're not doing

04:37.027 --> 04:39.654
the happy dance.

04:42.365 --> 04:47.121
BOTH:

04:42.365 --> 04:47.121
Happy dance, happy dance,

04:42.365 --> 04:47.121
we love to do the happy dance.

04:47.162 --> 04:48.622
Happier.

04:48.663 --> 04:50.624
Happy dance, happy dance,

04:50.665 --> 04:52.584
we love to do the happy dance.

04:52.626 --> 04:54.335
Happier.

04:54.377 --> 04:58.173
Happy dance, happy dance,

04:54.377 --> 04:58.173
we love to do the...!

05:00.801 --> 05:02.343
(meowing)

05:02.385 --> 05:04.805
CRAIG:

05:02.385 --> 05:04.805
A half-cup of wet food

05:02.385 --> 05:04.805
in one bowl

05:04.846 --> 05:07.057
and a half-cup of dry

05:04.846 --> 05:07.057
in another.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.143
He likes the juice

05:07.099 --> 05:09.143
from the wet half

05:09.184 --> 05:11.352
poured onto the dry.

05:11.394 --> 05:14.648
Jellybean also likes you

05:11.394 --> 05:14.648
better than your brothers.

05:14.689 --> 05:17.358
Everyone likes you better

05:14.689 --> 05:17.358
than your brothers.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.736
Someday, you're going to be

05:17.400 --> 05:19.736
president of Idaho

05:19.778 --> 05:22.781
and anyone taller than you

05:19.778 --> 05:22.781
will be fed to wolves.

05:22.823 --> 05:24.783
Time for your eardrops,

05:22.823 --> 05:24.783
Jellybean.

05:24.825 --> 05:27.077
(meows)

05:29.704 --> 05:32.332
(grunting)

05:35.335 --> 05:39.047
Okay, Jellybean, stop hiding.

05:39.089 --> 05:41.382
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

05:41.424 --> 05:42.467
(meowing)

05:43.426 --> 05:44.636
Okay, come on.

05:44.678 --> 05:46.345
(meows)

05:51.434 --> 05:53.394
(meows)

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
Please don't go

05:53.436 --> 05:55.438
outside, Jellybean.

05:55.480 --> 05:57.899
Don't be scared, Jellybean.

05:57.941 --> 06:00.443
They're just eardrops. See?

06:00.485 --> 06:01.987
(screaming)

06:02.029 --> 06:04.198
Jellybean!

06:04.239 --> 06:05.657
(screaming)

06:05.699 --> 06:07.034
Jellybean!

06:07.075 --> 06:09.077
♪ ♪

06:41.484 --> 06:42.986
Turn.

06:46.489 --> 06:49.450
Hey, Ma, can I borrow the car

06:46.489 --> 06:49.450
to go over to Richie's house?

06:49.492 --> 06:50.451
Uh, no.

06:50.493 --> 06:52.162
Why not?

06:52.204 --> 06:54.289
Because whenever you return

06:52.204 --> 06:54.289
the car, it's always filthy.

06:54.331 --> 06:55.623
That is so unfair.

06:55.665 --> 06:58.293
You always assume

06:55.665 --> 06:58.293
the worst of me.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.295
Assume? I see it.

07:00.337 --> 07:02.381
How am I going to show you

07:00.337 --> 07:02.381
that I've actually grown up

07:02.421 --> 07:03.840
if you never give me

07:02.421 --> 07:03.840
the chance?!

07:03.882 --> 07:05.508
Okay, I'm listening.

07:05.550 --> 07:08.929
Okay, how about if I wash

07:05.550 --> 07:08.929
the car before I take it?

07:08.970 --> 07:11.390
And I'll rake the leaves

07:08.970 --> 07:11.390
and I'll scoop out the gutters,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.641
and if that's not enough,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.641
I'll clean the whole attic!

07:13.683 --> 07:15.643
Mom, give him a break.

07:15.685 --> 07:18.272
Okay, you got yourself a deal.

07:18.313 --> 07:20.690
Bring it home in one piece.

07:20.732 --> 07:24.485
You need anything ironed,

07:20.732 --> 07:24.485
Mom?

07:24.527 --> 07:27.989
Dewey? You in here, son?

07:28.031 --> 07:30.491
What's wrong, son?

07:30.533 --> 07:32.577
You were supposed to

07:30.533 --> 07:32.577
be home hours ago.

07:32.619 --> 07:34.788
I can't do anything right.

07:34.829 --> 07:37.707
Dewey.

07:37.749 --> 07:39.334
Where's Jellybean?

07:39.376 --> 07:42.296
I left the door open,

07:39.376 --> 07:42.296
and he ran away.

07:42.337 --> 07:44.505
Oh, dear.

07:44.547 --> 07:46.800
Do we have to tell Mom?

07:46.841 --> 07:49.761
Well, this is a very

07:46.841 --> 07:49.761
serious situation, son.

07:49.803 --> 07:52.513
Of course we're not going

07:49.803 --> 07:52.513
to tell your mother.

07:52.555 --> 07:53.514
Really?

07:53.556 --> 07:54.933
Really.

07:54.975 --> 07:56.726
But I think it might

07:54.975 --> 07:56.726
be a little bit

07:56.768 --> 07:59.520
too much responsibility

07:56.768 --> 07:59.520
for your first job.

07:59.562 --> 08:01.606
Hey, don't worry,

07:59.562 --> 08:01.606
we'll find Jellybean.

08:01.648 --> 08:03.524
But I've been looking for hours.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.735
Well, that's your

08:03.566 --> 08:05.735
first lesson, Dewey.

08:05.777 --> 08:07.946
Sometimes it takes a lot

08:05.777 --> 08:07.946
of time and hard work

08:07.988 --> 08:09.530
to accomplish something.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.241
But what if

08:09.572 --> 08:11.241
Jellybean's hurt?

08:11.283 --> 08:12.617
It's dark outside.

08:12.659 --> 08:14.619
Let me tell you

08:12.659 --> 08:14.619
a little something

08:14.661 --> 08:16.037
about cats, all right?

08:16.079 --> 08:17.622
They're nocturnal creatures,

08:17.664 --> 08:20.917
which means they

08:17.664 --> 08:20.917
prefer the night.

08:20.959 --> 08:24.254
Then again, so do

08:20.959 --> 08:24.254
coyotes and feral dogs

08:24.296 --> 08:27.174
and devil worshippers.

08:27.215 --> 08:30.551
My point is that

08:27.215 --> 08:30.551
Jellybean is fine.

08:30.593 --> 08:33.013
He'll come home when

08:30.593 --> 08:33.013
he's good and ready.

08:33.054 --> 08:35.598
We're just going to put

08:33.054 --> 08:35.598
a little bowl of food out,

08:35.640 --> 08:38.185
and he'll come back.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.811
Are you sure?

08:39.853 --> 08:44.274
Trust me, tomorrow morning,

08:39.853 --> 08:44.274
everything is going to be fine.

08:48.695 --> 08:51.365
Dad! Jellybean's bowl is empty!

08:51.406 --> 08:53.408
He was here!

08:53.450 --> 08:55.576
You're the smartest man

08:53.450 --> 08:55.576
in the world!

08:55.618 --> 08:57.245
Yes!

09:04.002 --> 09:05.586
No sign of forced entry.

09:05.628 --> 09:07.422
I just don't see how

09:05.628 --> 09:07.422
these guys got in.

09:07.464 --> 09:08.631
It's a mystery.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.092
You left

09:08.673 --> 09:11.092
the window open.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.593
Mystery solved.

09:11.134 --> 09:12.593
I'm sorry,

09:12.635 --> 09:14.471
what is it you say

09:12.635 --> 09:14.471
you're doing here again?

09:14.513 --> 09:16.639
We're watching the cat

09:14.513 --> 09:16.639
while the owner's away.

09:16.681 --> 09:18.975
I don't see a cat.

09:19.017 --> 09:21.602
We're not doing

09:19.017 --> 09:21.602
a very good job.

09:21.644 --> 09:23.563
(phone ringing)

09:25.648 --> 09:27.608
Hello?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.444
CRAIG:

09:27.650 --> 09:29.444
Hal?

09:29.486 --> 09:32.655
Oh, Craig! Hi!

09:32.697 --> 09:33.614
How's the convention?

09:33.656 --> 09:34.782
Fantastic.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.701
I've picked up

09:34.824 --> 09:36.701
some great bargains.

09:36.743 --> 09:39.871
You would not believe some of

09:36.743 --> 09:39.871
the idiots that are here.

09:39.913 --> 09:43.250
Anyhow, I just called

09:39.913 --> 09:43.250
to see how Jellybean's doing.

09:43.291 --> 09:45.793
Oh, fine. He's a frisky

09:43.291 --> 09:45.793
little guy, you know.

09:45.835 --> 09:48.088
Oh, get off the TV,

09:45.835 --> 09:48.088
Jellybean!

09:48.129 --> 09:49.339
That reminds me--

09:49.381 --> 09:51.632
could you hit the timer button

09:49.381 --> 09:51.632
on my VCR?

09:51.674 --> 09:52.633
I want to tape  Arliss.

09:52.675 --> 09:54.886
Uh...

09:54.928 --> 09:57.931
Sure, no problem.

09:57.972 --> 10:01.642
Hey, Hal, um, I don't want you

09:57.972 --> 10:01.642
to think I'm weird, but...

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
could you put Jellybean

10:01.684 --> 10:03.937
on the phone?

10:03.978 --> 10:07.065
Uh, yeah, let me just...

10:07.107 --> 10:08.649
pick him up, yeah...

10:08.691 --> 10:10.569
There he is!

10:10.610 --> 10:11.652
Okay...

10:11.694 --> 10:13.488
Okay, I got his ear

10:11.694 --> 10:13.488
to the phone!

10:13.530 --> 10:14.655
Hey, Jellybean!

10:14.697 --> 10:16.657
How's my widdle pussycat?

10:16.699 --> 10:18.577
Have you been a good boy

10:18.618 --> 10:20.912
while I've been away?

10:20.954 --> 10:24.124
(purring)

10:24.165 --> 10:25.875
I love you, honey.

10:25.917 --> 10:27.752
Give Daddy a kiss.

10:27.794 --> 10:28.878
(smooching)

10:28.920 --> 10:30.755
Jellybean?

10:32.715 --> 10:35.510
I got to tell you, Reese,

10:32.715 --> 10:35.510
you are doing a great job.

10:35.552 --> 10:37.345
I am very impressed.

10:37.387 --> 10:38.679
Thank you.

10:38.721 --> 10:39.722
Here?

10:39.764 --> 10:43.059
Nah, one over.

10:43.101 --> 10:45.353
I just want to point out

10:45.395 --> 10:47.147
that Malcolm has not

10:45.395 --> 10:47.147
done a thing,

10:47.188 --> 10:49.983
and I have been carrying

10:47.188 --> 10:49.983
you around all afternoon.

10:50.024 --> 10:51.401
Don't think your enthusiasm

10:51.443 --> 10:52.860
and that pathetic

10:51.443 --> 10:52.860
look of desperation

10:52.902 --> 10:53.987
are going unnoticed.

10:54.028 --> 10:54.904
Here you go, Francis.

10:54.946 --> 10:56.281
What's this?

10:56.323 --> 10:57.907
MALCOLM:

10:56.323 --> 10:57.907
Your English term paper

10:57.949 --> 10:58.908
on the rise of the novel.

10:58.950 --> 11:00.701
It's a guaranteed "A."

11:00.743 --> 11:02.579
You can screw off the whole

11:00.743 --> 11:02.579
rest of this semester

11:02.621 --> 11:03.830
and still pull a "C."

11:05.999 --> 11:08.668
This pleases me.

11:21.640 --> 11:23.141
Jellybean!

11:23.183 --> 11:24.601
Come on, Jellybean.

11:24.643 --> 11:26.894
Come to Hal.

11:26.936 --> 11:29.730
That's a good pussycat.

11:30.649 --> 11:33.568
That's a good pussycat.

11:33.610 --> 11:36.363
Stay right where you... Damn!

11:36.404 --> 11:38.739
Come back here, Jellybean!

11:38.781 --> 11:42.035
Jellybean!

11:38.781 --> 11:42.035
You want some kissy-kisses?!

11:42.076 --> 11:43.828
(shrieking)

11:43.870 --> 11:45.455
Kissy-kisses!

11:45.497 --> 11:46.747
(panting)

11:46.789 --> 11:48.916
(kissing sounds)

11:48.958 --> 11:51.752
(louder kissing sounds)

11:51.794 --> 11:54.713
(shrieking)

11:57.800 --> 11:59.511
What is it?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.347
What?

12:02.389 --> 12:03.848
You know, I realized something.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.393
You could do Francis's homework

12:03.890 --> 12:06.393
for the next ten years,

12:06.434 --> 12:08.687
but you still can't go

12:06.434 --> 12:08.687
to Rage in the Cage

12:08.727 --> 12:09.770
if you're grounded.

12:09.812 --> 12:11.314
What are you talking about?

12:12.065 --> 12:14.526
Mom!

12:18.821 --> 12:20.198
(gasps)

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
What is with

12:22.825 --> 12:23.784
you, Reese?

12:23.826 --> 12:25.203
You've got to get in there

12:25.245 --> 12:26.787
and see what Malcolm

12:25.245 --> 12:26.787
did to Dewey.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.456
He's totally lost it!

12:26.829 --> 12:28.456
Hey, Mom.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.790
Where's Dewey?

12:29.832 --> 12:32.168
He left early

12:29.832 --> 12:32.168
to go feed Craig's cat.

12:32.210 --> 12:33.794
No way!

12:35.838 --> 12:36.881
Huh?

12:36.923 --> 12:39.509
What is going on

12:36.923 --> 12:39.509
with you, Reese?

12:43.638 --> 12:46.641
Oh!

12:50.645 --> 12:53.314
Dewey, wait till you

12:50.645 --> 12:53.314
see who I found...

12:53.356 --> 12:54.482
What happened to your face?

12:54.524 --> 12:56.025
What happened to your pants?

12:56.067 --> 12:57.694
Never mind that.

12:57.736 --> 12:59.820
Look who I have.

12:59.862 --> 13:01.740
Mrs. Johnson's cat?

13:01.780 --> 13:05.452
Yes... Mrs. Johnson's

13:01.780 --> 13:05.452
cat, yes!

13:05.493 --> 13:07.328
Go, scoot.

13:07.370 --> 13:08.622
(blows)

13:08.663 --> 13:11.374
♪ ♪

13:46.951 --> 13:50.163
Hey! I found these in

13:46.951 --> 13:50.163
the laundry in my shirt pocket!

13:50.204 --> 13:52.123
You put them there,

13:50.204 --> 13:52.123
didn't you?!

13:52.165 --> 13:55.876
Yeah, just like you put my muddy

13:52.165 --> 13:55.876
sneaker on the kitchen table!

13:55.918 --> 13:58.129
Guys, what's going on?

13:58.171 --> 14:00.548
He's trying to get me grounded

13:58.171 --> 14:00.548
so I can't go with you,

14:00.590 --> 14:01.966
but he's too stupid

14:00.590 --> 14:01.966
to pull it off!

14:02.008 --> 14:03.551
We'll see who's stupid

14:02.008 --> 14:03.551
when this stupid

14:03.593 --> 14:04.927
is watching

14:03.593 --> 14:04.927
a wrestling match.

14:04.969 --> 14:06.262
Whoa, guys, this is

14:06.304 --> 14:07.888
supposed to be

14:06.304 --> 14:07.888
a contest about love,

14:07.930 --> 14:10.767
and you've twisted it

14:07.930 --> 14:10.767
into something ugly.

14:10.809 --> 14:11.892
Carry on.

14:11.934 --> 14:13.269
(both shouting)

14:13.311 --> 14:15.730
Get off me!

14:13.311 --> 14:15.730
Get off! Ow!

14:15.772 --> 14:18.692
This, too, pleases me.

14:18.733 --> 14:21.486
Okay, we can fix this.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.404
Cats are territorial.

14:23.446 --> 14:26.324
I'd put money on it

14:23.446 --> 14:26.324
that Jellybean hasn't been

14:26.366 --> 14:28.909
outside a square block

14:26.366 --> 14:28.909
of this place.

14:28.951 --> 14:30.161
Ooh!

14:30.203 --> 14:32.413
Yup, he's been back.

14:32.455 --> 14:33.707
(sniffing)

14:33.748 --> 14:34.915
These are fresh.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.584
But he never stays.

14:36.626 --> 14:38.919
Well, then we'll just

14:36.626 --> 14:38.919
have to find

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
a way to keep him here,

14:38.961 --> 14:40.921
won't we?

14:40.963 --> 14:43.299
Paid a little visit

14:40.963 --> 14:43.299
to my doctor.

14:43.341 --> 14:44.300
What are those?

14:44.342 --> 14:47.428
These are sleeping pills,

14:44.342 --> 14:47.428
Dewey.

14:47.470 --> 14:49.930
I simply told him I've been up

14:47.470 --> 14:49.930
for the past few nights,

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
things aren't going

14:49.972 --> 14:51.932
well with the wife,

14:51.974 --> 14:55.311
afraid I'm going

14:51.974 --> 14:55.311
to lose the house...

14:55.353 --> 14:56.855
But don't you worry, son.

14:56.896 --> 14:59.148
Those are just lies I told

14:56.896 --> 14:59.148
to get prescription drugs.

14:59.190 --> 15:01.317
Now, we're just going

14:59.190 --> 15:01.317
to grind a few of these up,

15:01.359 --> 15:02.943
sprinkle it on his food,

15:02.985 --> 15:05.154
and it's sweet

15:02.985 --> 15:05.154
dreams, Jellybean.

15:05.196 --> 15:07.782
Should we put them

15:05.196 --> 15:07.782
in the wet or the dry?

15:07.824 --> 15:08.949
The wet, dry, milk, water--

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
we have to cover

15:08.991 --> 15:10.951
all our bases, son.

15:10.993 --> 15:13.037
We are going to get this cat!

15:16.040 --> 15:18.668
(cats purring, snoring)

15:18.710 --> 15:21.045
Which one's Jellybean?

15:21.087 --> 15:23.005
Well, that's

15:21.087 --> 15:23.005
another challenge.

15:23.047 --> 15:25.007
We'll make three piles:

15:25.049 --> 15:27.677
"Probably Not Jellybean,"

15:25.049 --> 15:27.677
"Definitely Not Jellybean,"

15:27.719 --> 15:29.053
and... "Not Even a Cat."

15:29.095 --> 15:30.971
We'll start with that possum.

15:31.013 --> 15:33.224
I think it's time

15:31.013 --> 15:33.224
to call Mom.

15:33.266 --> 15:36.018
I was hoping you'd say that.

15:41.315 --> 15:43.984
Rage in the Cage.

15:44.026 --> 15:45.695
What are you doing?

15:45.737 --> 15:47.988
Wait till Mom sees what you did

15:45.737 --> 15:47.988
to my expensive microscope.

15:48.030 --> 15:49.616
You don't have the guts.

15:49.657 --> 15:50.867
Say you quit, Reese.

15:50.909 --> 15:53.620
No! You're going

15:50.909 --> 15:53.620
to totally be grounded

15:53.661 --> 15:55.789
when Mom sees

15:53.661 --> 15:55.789
the beating you gave me.

15:55.830 --> 15:57.998
(screams)

15:58.040 --> 15:58.999
What are you doing?

15:59.041 --> 16:01.335
(grunting)

16:02.879 --> 16:03.880
Sucker!

16:03.922 --> 16:06.424
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

16:06.466 --> 16:08.134
(yells)

16:17.059 --> 16:18.603
Hey, hey, hey!

16:18.645 --> 16:21.021
This isn't about

16:18.645 --> 16:21.021
the tickets, is it?

16:21.063 --> 16:23.441
You have to decide.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.441
Who's going with you?!

16:23.483 --> 16:26.026
Oh, yeah, I probably should've

16:23.483 --> 16:26.026
said something.

16:26.068 --> 16:28.237
I met this girl

16:26.068 --> 16:28.237
at the Burger Barn,

16:28.279 --> 16:29.029
and guess what?

16:29.071 --> 16:30.531
She likes wrestling.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.826
What? You can't.

16:32.867 --> 16:34.034
Guys, it's a  girl...

16:34.076 --> 16:36.036
who likes  wrestling.

16:36.078 --> 16:38.873
I'm just as much

16:36.078 --> 16:38.873
a victim as you are.

16:40.708 --> 16:42.752
Aw, you'll understand

16:40.708 --> 16:42.752
when you're older.

16:42.794 --> 16:44.253
You guys are cool.

16:44.295 --> 16:47.006
I'm definitely bringing you home

16:44.295 --> 16:47.006
a couple programs.

16:49.801 --> 16:52.052
You're telling me

16:49.801 --> 16:52.052
none of these cats is Jellybean?

16:52.094 --> 16:53.680
What's wrong with you?!

16:53.721 --> 16:56.140
Come on, Lois, this is a

16:53.721 --> 16:56.140
very complicated situation.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.892
Don't blame Dewey.

16:57.934 --> 16:59.143
I am not blaming Dewey.

16:59.185 --> 17:00.060
Oh.

17:00.102 --> 17:01.896
Mom, maybe we can...

17:01.938 --> 17:04.064
Dewey, it's okay, just let

17:01.938 --> 17:04.064
your mom take care of it.

17:04.106 --> 17:05.650
Now here's what

17:04.106 --> 17:05.650
we're going to do.

17:05.692 --> 17:08.068
Okay, I'll say it.

17:08.110 --> 17:11.071
It was a really bad idea.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.573
(thumping)

17:12.615 --> 17:14.241
I'll tell you

17:12.615 --> 17:14.241
one thing--

17:14.283 --> 17:16.744
I've never seen 50 cats

17:14.283 --> 17:16.744
run out of a place so fast.

17:16.786 --> 17:18.287
Hal, how could this

17:16.786 --> 17:18.287
have happened?

17:18.329 --> 17:19.789
We've ruined Craig's life.

17:19.831 --> 17:21.708
No, no, it is not

17:19.831 --> 17:21.708
our fault, Lois.

17:21.749 --> 17:23.459
At a certain point,

17:21.749 --> 17:23.459
we simply have to say

17:23.501 --> 17:26.379
to ourselves that

17:23.501 --> 17:26.379
Craig is just cursed.

17:26.420 --> 17:27.922
Dad, it's Jellybean!

17:27.964 --> 17:28.756
HAL:

17:27.964 --> 17:28.756
Oh, my God!

17:28.798 --> 17:30.090
Oh, my God.

17:30.132 --> 17:32.134
Let me just grind up one

17:30.132 --> 17:32.134
of these sleeping pills.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.095
Won't take a minute.

17:32.176 --> 17:35.095
Keep him entertained.

17:35.137 --> 17:37.849
Or we could just pick him up.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.811
Yay!

17:41.853 --> 17:45.314
You see, Dewey, I told you

17:41.853 --> 17:45.314
everything would work out.

17:45.356 --> 17:47.358
(screams)

17:47.400 --> 17:50.110
FRANCIS:  You know,

17:47.400 --> 17:50.110
it doesn't pay as well

17:50.152 --> 17:51.738
as some other summer jobs,

17:51.779 --> 17:54.156
but I get the chance

17:51.779 --> 17:54.156
to mentor inner-city children.

17:54.198 --> 17:56.367
And how can you put

17:54.198 --> 17:56.367
a price on smiles?

17:56.409 --> 17:59.286
Oh, you're cute  and  sweet.

17:59.328 --> 18:02.122
You know, this is the first time

17:59.328 --> 18:02.122
I've gone out in six months.

18:02.164 --> 18:04.751
Then... we'll have to make this

18:04.792 --> 18:07.837
a night to remember, won't we?

18:12.425 --> 18:14.134
Amateurs.

18:14.176 --> 18:15.053
What?

18:15.094 --> 18:16.054
Oh, it's nothing.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.137
It's just a prank from...

18:17.179 --> 18:18.848
some of the kids

18:17.179 --> 18:18.848
at the center.

18:18.890 --> 18:21.141
You know, it's inspiring

18:18.890 --> 18:21.141
how they can laugh

18:21.183 --> 18:22.727
after all they've been through.

18:22.769 --> 18:23.978
(siren whoops)

18:24.020 --> 18:26.105
Oh, man!

18:27.023 --> 18:28.066
I wasn't speeding, was I?

18:28.107 --> 18:30.150
I don't think so.

18:33.863 --> 18:35.155
License and

18:33.863 --> 18:35.155
registration.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.156
Officer, what did I do?

18:36.198 --> 18:37.742
This car has been

18:36.198 --> 18:37.742
reported stolen.

18:37.784 --> 18:39.159
License and

18:37.784 --> 18:39.159
registration, please.

18:39.201 --> 18:42.789
Oh, it's been reported

18:39.201 --> 18:42.789
stolen, huh?

18:48.669 --> 18:51.965
I'm not going to ask you again.

18:48.669 --> 18:51.965
License and registration.

18:52.006 --> 18:54.968
Look, Officer,

18:52.006 --> 18:54.968
I know this looks bad, but...

18:55.009 --> 18:57.177
(thumping)

18:57.219 --> 18:58.387
Open the trunk, sir.

18:58.429 --> 18:59.764
Officer, let me explain...

18:59.806 --> 19:01.140
Open the trunk!

19:08.022 --> 19:10.190
(muffled cries)

19:11.233 --> 19:14.112
Get out of the car!

19:16.864 --> 19:18.198
Mom wasn't too thrilled

19:18.240 --> 19:20.284
about having to pick us up

19:18.240 --> 19:20.284
at the police station,

19:20.326 --> 19:21.786
but it was totally worth it.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.370
We don't have to serve

19:21.828 --> 19:23.370
Francis anymore.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.872
Here's your sandwich, Craig.

19:24.914 --> 19:26.206
Can I go to bed now?

19:26.248 --> 19:28.709
Ooh, mayo on only one side?

19:28.751 --> 19:30.086
It's a lot of mayo.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.420
No one's saying it's not,

19:31.462 --> 19:33.213
but I specifically asked

19:31.462 --> 19:33.213
for it on both sides.

19:33.255 --> 19:34.715
Craig...

19:33.255 --> 19:34.715
Malcolm,

19:34.757 --> 19:36.509
I don't like this

19:34.757 --> 19:36.509
any more than you do,

19:36.550 --> 19:38.218
but it was your mom's idea.

19:38.260 --> 19:40.847
Since as long as I'm living here

19:38.260 --> 19:40.847
you have to do everything I say,

19:40.888 --> 19:43.223
I'll try to meet you

19:40.888 --> 19:43.223
halfway and make my orders

19:43.265 --> 19:45.309
as clear as possible,

19:43.265 --> 19:45.309
okay, champ?

19:45.351 --> 19:48.938
Here, I heated it for

19:45.351 --> 19:48.938
ten seconds just like you said.

19:48.980 --> 19:51.858
It's still not quite

19:48.980 --> 19:51.858
room temperature.

19:51.899 --> 19:54.318
Look, I know I'm

19:51.899 --> 19:54.318
being demanding,

19:54.360 --> 19:57.989
but Jellybean's apartment

19:54.360 --> 19:57.989
was burned down, too.

20:01.283 --> 20:03.077
All right,

20:01.283 --> 20:03.077
it was  almost  worth it.

20:03.119 --> 20:05.245
(kissing sounds)

20:12.712 --> 20:13.963
(door slams)

20:14.005 --> 20:16.632
There's something

20:14.005 --> 20:16.632
you have to see.

20:16.674 --> 20:18.217
(slate beeps)

20:20.011 --> 20:21.261
(laughter)

20:21.303 --> 20:22.680
MAN:

20:21.303 --> 20:22.680
Cut.

20:22.722 --> 20:24.182
(slate beeps)

20:24.223 --> 20:25.307
(moaning)

20:25.349 --> 20:27.768
Oh, honey, the night

20:25.349 --> 20:27.768
is still young.

20:27.810 --> 20:28.895
What's the line?

20:28.936 --> 20:30.270
I'm sorry.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.355
(slate beeps)

20:33.816 --> 20:36.194
(banging)

20:36.235 --> 20:37.277
MAN:

20:36.235 --> 20:37.277
Cut.

20:37.319 --> 20:38.362
(slate beeps)

20:38.404 --> 20:40.614
Ow!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.326
MAN:

20:43.325 --> 20:44.326
Cut.

20:44.368 --> 20:46.746
(laughter)

20:46.787 --> 20:48.288
Shut up!

20:46.787 --> 20:48.288
We wouldn't be in this mess

20:48.330 --> 20:49.665
if you hadn't called for help.

20:49.707 --> 20:51.918
Keep... pushing me...

20:51.959 --> 20:53.920
ass (bleep).

20:53.961 --> 20:55.295
(laughter)

20:55.337 --> 20:56.296
Would you guys stop laughing?

20:56.338 --> 20:57.757
Dang, it's not that funny.

20:57.798 --> 20:59.383
Craig, you can't

20:57.798 --> 20:59.383
say "ass (bleep)."

20:59.425 --> 21:01.301
Keep...

21:01.343 --> 21:02.386
pushing me...

21:02.428 --> 21:04.304
ass (bleep).

21:04.346 --> 21:06.306
(laughter)

21:06.348 --> 21:07.307
Whoo!

21:07.349 --> 21:08.935
(slate beeps)

21:08.976 --> 21:11.020
(retching)

21:11.062 --> 21:12.396
(laughter)

21:12.438 --> 21:13.856
MAN:

21:12.438 --> 21:13.856
Cut! Cut!

21:13.898 --> 21:15.900
Now, honey, I'm sorry

21:13.898 --> 21:15.900
you had to see that.
