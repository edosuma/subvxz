14:59.768 --> 15:00.987
What am I supposed
to do, tell him

15:01.030 --> 15:02.945
Adam Noshimuri
killed his own sister?

15:02.989 --> 15:05.382
With no proof? That's really
gonna go over well.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.254
You found the murder weapon
in a drawer in Adam's house.

15:07.297 --> 15:08.908
No, I didn't; I found a gun

15:08.951 --> 15:10.518
that happens to be
the same caliber.

15:10.561 --> 15:12.912
That hardly constitutes
a murder weapon.

15:12.955 --> 15:15.784
Well, did you
get it tested?

15:15.827 --> 15:17.220
Don't think I haven't
thought of that.

15:17.264 --> 15:19.788
Then what are you waiting for?

15:19.831 --> 15:21.311
If it doesn't come back
as the murder weapon,

15:21.355 --> 15:23.531
then you can stop
thinking about it.

15:25.054 --> 15:27.448
And if it does?

15:31.234 --> 15:33.671
NOELANI:
Commander, I found something
on Agent Hennessey

15:33.715 --> 15:34.890
I think you should see.

15:36.631 --> 15:39.286
Something on the lashes.

15:39.329 --> 15:41.723
Is that it?That white stuff
is called "gutta-percha."

15:41.766 --> 15:43.333
Gutta-percha?

15:43.377 --> 15:46.380
It's used by dentists after a
root canal to plug up the holes.

15:46.423 --> 15:48.991
Has a slight eucalyptus
taste to it.

15:49.035 --> 15:51.341
But it wasn't just
in the eyes.

15:51.385 --> 15:53.778
I found residuals
of the same sealing substance

15:53.822 --> 15:55.519
in the hair follicles
of his nose and ears.

15:55.563 --> 15:58.305
Wait a minute,
Hennessey's eyes, nose,

15:58.348 --> 16:01.264
and ears were sealed up
with this gutta-percha stuff,

16:01.308 --> 16:03.701
and then he was drowned?

16:03.745 --> 16:05.790
Why?

16:05.834 --> 16:08.968
Commander, I just
find the evidence.

16:09.011 --> 16:10.447
Your job is
to solve the crime.

16:11.840 --> 16:13.798
All right.
Thanks, Noelani.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.506
STEVE: [over comm]:
Hennessey, we're taking fire.

16:25.549 --> 16:27.421
Heavy casualties.
What's your status?

16:27.464 --> 16:29.771
HENNESSEY: We're on our way.
Hang in there, buddy.

16:56.885 --> 16:58.452
Hey.

16:58.495 --> 17:01.020
Hey.
Walk with me.

17:02.325 --> 17:03.457
Listen, thanks for coming.

17:03.500 --> 17:06.068
Of course.

17:06.112 --> 17:08.027
I just figured
after Morocco, maybe...

17:08.070 --> 17:10.246
I'd never want
to see you again?

17:10.290 --> 17:12.988
Don't flatter yourself,
Steve.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.643
We spent two days of R&R
in a Marrakesh fleabag.

17:15.686 --> 17:17.123
I didn't expect you
to propose.

17:17.166 --> 17:19.473
Okay, well, I really
did get deployed,

17:19.516 --> 17:20.778
just so you know.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.128
I found your note.
Good.

17:22.171 --> 17:25.305
Everything I wrote
in that note was true.

17:25.348 --> 17:28.177
[clears throat]
Except the part about
seeing each other again.

17:28.221 --> 17:31.354
Yeah, my life got
a little complicated.

17:31.398 --> 17:32.703
Yeah, I know.

17:32.747 --> 17:34.314
Lieutenant Rollins and I
ran into each other

17:34.357 --> 17:37.752
a few years back.

17:37.795 --> 17:40.929
But you didn't ask me here
to talk about old times.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.025
Does your, uh,
your partner know

17:50.069 --> 17:51.200
you came to meet me today?

17:51.244 --> 17:53.507
Miller's not good
with secrets.

17:53.550 --> 17:57.032
Okay. And?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.729
He told me to keep
my mouth shut,

17:58.773 --> 18:00.035
get you talking.

18:00.079 --> 18:01.123
Hopefully,
whatever you know

18:01.167 --> 18:02.472
can help us find
Hennessey's killer.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.301
All I got's a riddle.

18:05.345 --> 18:07.303
Maybe I can answer it.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.131
First, I want to know
what Hennessey was working on.

18:09.175 --> 18:12.221
Routine intel gathering.
Nothing with a clock.

18:12.265 --> 18:13.744
Routine intel gathering?

18:13.788 --> 18:16.138
That why they
assigned you to this?

18:16.182 --> 18:19.228
No one assigned me.
I asked.

18:19.272 --> 18:20.490
Hennessey was my friend, too.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.145
Okay, so we both
want the same thing.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.147
Agreed.
Good.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.497
So, what was Hennessey
working on that got him killed?

18:29.325 --> 18:31.762
Greer, you can tell me,
or I can go over your head.

18:31.806 --> 18:33.677
Okay.

18:33.721 --> 18:35.897
Hennessey was one
of a dozen key agents

18:35.940 --> 18:37.768
at work right now in a dozen
different countries.

18:37.812 --> 18:39.944
You knew Anderson,
Glenn Anderson?
Yeah.

18:39.988 --> 18:42.033
We were down range together
in the sandbox in '03.

18:42.077 --> 18:43.339
But wait a minute,
you said "knew."

18:43.383 --> 18:44.340
What are you talking about?

18:44.384 --> 18:46.777
Well, ten days ago
in Jakarta,

18:46.821 --> 18:48.214
he drove his car
off the road.

18:48.257 --> 18:51.304
Killed instantly.

18:51.347 --> 18:54.089
Why do you think
it wasn't an accident?

18:54.133 --> 18:56.918
Anderson in Jakarta,
Stanton in Bangkok,

18:56.961 --> 18:59.225
Burke in Korea,
Brubaker in Hong Kong.

18:59.268 --> 19:02.053
Now Hennessey in Hawaii.

19:02.097 --> 19:06.406
Five top agents dead
in three months.

19:06.449 --> 19:08.234
Despite your theory
on Hennessey,

19:08.277 --> 19:10.801
so far, not a shred of
evidence to the contrary.

19:10.845 --> 19:12.803
All accidental deaths.
No.

19:12.847 --> 19:14.936
No, it's impossible.Of course.

19:14.979 --> 19:17.765
Meanwhile, our whole Pacific
Operation is caving in on us.

19:17.808 --> 19:20.333
Well, wait a minute, the CIA
has to have some lead,

19:20.376 --> 19:22.422
a theory at least.
We do.

19:22.465 --> 19:24.554
And if you quote me,
I'll deny it.

19:24.598 --> 19:27.078
Of course.

19:27.122 --> 19:28.950
It's got to be
from the inside out.

19:31.605 --> 19:34.173
Are you telling me there's
a mole inside the CIA?

19:34.216 --> 19:35.957
Who is it?

19:36.000 --> 19:38.612
When you find out,
tell me.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.491
JERRY: "Cocoon."
It's the only complete word

19:48.535 --> 19:50.363
in all the charred pieces
from Hennessey's place.

19:50.406 --> 19:52.756
The rest are just fragments.

19:53.714 --> 19:55.977
GROVER:
"A-R-C."

19:56.020 --> 19:57.326
What are those two swoops
before the "A"?

19:57.370 --> 20:00.460
Those fragmented symbols
occur over and over

20:00.503 --> 20:01.635
throughout the other remains.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.289
The lab has yet
to crack them.

20:03.332 --> 20:06.117
However, they were able
to find this.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.772
TANI:
"R-U-S." Okay, that's legible.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.078
That's clearly the end
of a word.

20:10.121 --> 20:11.645
Yeah, the "R-U-S" ending

20:11.688 --> 20:13.777
appears a number of times
in the remaining pages.

20:13.821 --> 20:15.910
Okay, so we need to find
the missing piece that
connects the two.

20:15.953 --> 20:18.478
Okay, they couldn't find
the exact segment,

20:18.521 --> 20:20.654
but the lab ran a scan
of the remaining pieces,

20:20.697 --> 20:21.959
and recovered this.

20:22.003 --> 20:24.310
And when you slide them
together...

20:24.353 --> 20:27.269
STEVE: What is that?
It spells "Arcturus."

20:27.313 --> 20:29.315
What is Arcturus?It's the name of a star.

20:29.358 --> 20:30.794
A star?
GROVER:
Okay.

20:30.838 --> 20:33.841
So, now we got two words:
cocoon and Arcturus.

20:33.884 --> 20:36.278
And a Chinese spy who broke into
your friend Hennessey's place

20:36.322 --> 20:38.019
so that we wouldn't find them.

20:38.062 --> 20:39.847
May be some kind of cipher.STEVE: I don't know,

20:39.890 --> 20:41.196
these were in Hennessey's
private notes.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.330
I doubt he coded anything.Hey, guys,

20:44.373 --> 20:46.332
I just heard from HPD,
and they found Hennessey's car.

20:46.375 --> 20:48.551
It was towed into impound
after sitting abandoned

20:48.595 --> 20:49.900
along the Sand
Island Parkway.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.728
That's nowhere near
where the body was found.

20:51.772 --> 20:53.208
STEVE:
Hold on now.

20:53.252 --> 20:56.646
Hennessey may have been
surveilling something out there.

20:56.690 --> 20:58.518
Junior, what's the closest pier

20:58.561 --> 20:59.780
to where they found
Hennessey's car?

20:59.823 --> 21:02.609
Uh, I think it was
Pier 10.

21:02.652 --> 21:06.134
That's a commercial pier.

21:06.177 --> 21:08.745
Jerry, what if these
swoops are S's?

21:12.009 --> 21:14.360
S.S. Arcturus.

21:15.404 --> 21:17.754
It's a ship.

21:31.159 --> 21:34.249
Oh... I got it.

21:34.293 --> 21:36.164
S.S. Arcturusright there.STEVE: All right, all right.

21:47.393 --> 21:48.829
She's sitting pretty low
in the water.

21:48.872 --> 21:50.787
Fuel tank's probably
filled with gas.

21:50.831 --> 21:52.485
Yeah, and what else?

21:52.528 --> 21:55.183
Huh.Hennessey was surveilling
this boat for a reason, Danny.

21:55.226 --> 21:58.273
Whatever is going through
your head right now,

21:58.317 --> 21:59.709
I just want you to know
it's a bad idea.

21:59.753 --> 22:01.276
I got to get on that boat.Right.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.930
It's a bad idea, okay?
And even if it was a good idea,

22:02.973 --> 22:04.061
what are you gonna do?
You gonna swim?

22:04.105 --> 22:05.454
You gonna swim over there?

25:11.553 --> 25:13.337
We believe Hennessey

25:13.381 --> 25:15.122
and some of his associates
were identified

25:15.165 --> 25:17.428
by a mole inside the CIA,

We failed at ours by not

25:30.311 --> 25:33.096

What are you talking
about, the gutta-percha?

25:35.359 --> 25:37.536
That's right. We found traces of
it in all the other autopsies,

25:37.579 --> 25:39.450

that the S.S. Arcturus

25:39.494 --> 25:41.235
was in every port
at the time of death.

25:43.150 --> 25:45.587
you found in the hold,
this cocoon,

25:45.631 --> 25:47.502
is some kind of

26:08.044 --> 26:10.351

that McGarrett

of incriminating information

26:14.877 --> 26:16.357
at Hennessey's apartment.

Then McGarrett's gonna
allow himself to get captured,

26:18.359 --> 26:19.839
and interrogated,

26:19.882 --> 26:23.103
and download a whole bunch
of misinformation.

26:23.146 --> 26:26.193
Correct.
That will then
do what exactly?

26:26.236 --> 26:28.282
Well, for a start, it'll expose
their communication channels.

26:28.325 --> 26:29.631
All right?

26:29.675 --> 26:31.502
The people who were behind
Hennessey's murder

26:31.546 --> 26:32.852
were convinced
that he was about to expose

26:48.389 --> 26:50.130

this information as well.

on that ship buy it,

26:52.436 --> 26:54.656
we have eyes and ears
