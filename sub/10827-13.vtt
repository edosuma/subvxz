WEBVTT

00:10.458 --> 00:11.804
-Watch it!

00:11.839 --> 00:12.460
-Sorry.

00:12.495 --> 00:13.254
-Can't stop.

00:13.289 --> 00:14.428
-It's an emergency.

00:20.779 --> 00:22.056
What's the emergency?

00:22.091 --> 00:25.370
-We sort of lied about
the emergency.

00:25.404 --> 00:27.061
-Actually, we've got
something for you.

00:27.096 --> 00:29.788
On behalf of the wolves you so
bravely protected, we'd like

00:29.822 --> 00:33.343
to present you with these.

00:33.378 --> 00:34.137
-Whoa.

00:34.172 --> 00:35.828
-They're amazing.

00:35.863 --> 00:37.209
-I framed them.

00:37.244 --> 00:39.487
-They look exactly like
the wolves we saw.

00:39.522 --> 00:43.595
-Oh, I just copied them from
photos on the internet.

00:43.629 --> 00:44.596
-Thank you.

00:48.462 --> 00:49.566
THEME SONG: A promise
that I keep.

00:49.601 --> 00:51.741
I'll never share, I'll
never speak.

00:51.775 --> 00:56.090
To my grave the secret goes.

00:56.125 --> 00:58.472
The beating, the
beating heart.

00:58.506 --> 01:00.715
Where mystic creatures
wandered far.

01:00.750 --> 01:04.581
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:04.616 --> 01:09.379
A change will come I know
behold my future.

01:09.414 --> 01:10.725
A promise that I keep.

01:10.760 --> 01:13.590
I'll never share, I'll
never speak.

01:13.625 --> 01:17.491
Through these veins
a wolfblood flows.

01:17.525 --> 01:20.114
-Department of the
environment.

01:20.149 --> 01:21.495
Why?

01:21.529 --> 01:23.635
-The wolves are in danger up
there, people like Kyle,

01:23.669 --> 01:25.878
farmers with guns.

01:25.913 --> 01:28.467
In some parts of America,
wolves are protected.

01:28.502 --> 01:30.676
And I'm going to get our
wolves protected too.

01:30.711 --> 01:32.195
-I don't know, Shannon.

01:32.230 --> 01:33.852
What if going public only
attracts more hunters?

01:33.886 --> 01:36.855
-Yeah, or the government
decide to shoot them.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.270
-I won't let that happen.

01:38.305 --> 01:40.169
-Look, I know you
want to help.

01:40.203 --> 01:41.963
-You weren't there, Maddy.

01:41.998 --> 01:45.346
Your picture brought it all back
to me, how they trusted

01:45.381 --> 01:47.797
me, how they knew I
was their friend.

01:47.831 --> 01:50.662
And I'm going to make sure no
one ever threatens them again.

01:50.696 --> 01:52.250
-Look, wolves have been
extinct in Britain for

01:52.284 --> 01:53.561
centuries, Shannon.

01:53.596 --> 01:55.598
Look, if you want the government
to start passing

01:55.632 --> 01:58.704
laws to protect them, you need
proof they actually do exist.

01:58.739 --> 02:00.948
-I know how to get it--

02:00.982 --> 02:03.261
cast wolf bate.

02:03.295 --> 02:05.539
It's irresistible, remember?

02:05.573 --> 02:06.712
-What, you've got some?

02:06.747 --> 02:08.542
-Well, Tom through the
canister away.

02:08.576 --> 02:10.820
But we'll go up there after
school, find it, attract the

02:10.854 --> 02:12.822
wolves, and take all
the photos we want.

02:18.828 --> 02:19.725
4 o'clock at Bernie's, right?

02:19.760 --> 02:21.555
-Can't we make it half past?

02:21.589 --> 02:24.489
-Yeah, I'm not going hiking
in my school gear.

02:24.523 --> 02:25.352
-[sighs]

02:25.386 --> 02:26.594
All right, quarter past.

02:26.629 --> 02:28.355
Look, it's really
important to me.

02:28.389 --> 02:29.459
I'm relying on you.

02:29.494 --> 02:30.633
-I know.

02:30.667 --> 02:32.290
-See ya at quarter past, then.

02:35.465 --> 02:36.535
-Why did we give them
those drawing?

02:36.570 --> 02:37.950
-It was your idea.

02:37.985 --> 02:39.987
-Yeah, I didn't know Shannon was
going to turn into David

02:40.021 --> 02:42.300
Attenborough, did I?

02:42.334 --> 02:43.922
-We should have said
we weren't going.

02:43.956 --> 02:46.683
Shannon opens a canister,
there's no wolves, job done.

02:46.718 --> 02:48.927
-What about tomorrow,
and the next day?

02:48.961 --> 02:50.584
She's not going to stop till
she gets what she wants?

02:50.618 --> 02:51.619
-Well, what happens if
we find the canister?

02:51.654 --> 02:53.518
Won't we just wolf out?

02:53.552 --> 02:55.761
-Dad's got some felt and
mask in his workshop.

02:55.796 --> 02:57.867
Meet us where Kyle trapped
us in 15 minutes.

03:13.814 --> 03:15.712
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]: Taking
up woodwork?

03:15.747 --> 03:17.300
-I was just--

03:17.335 --> 03:19.026
-Just running after Rhydian,
getting into more trouble.

03:19.060 --> 03:20.924
-I'm trying to stop trouble,
not cause it.

03:20.959 --> 03:23.410
There's more of that chemical
bait there and Shannon's going

03:23.444 --> 03:24.514
to release it.

03:24.549 --> 03:25.791
-Why?

03:25.826 --> 03:27.586
-She wants to get the wolves
protected by law.

03:27.621 --> 03:29.485
And the only way she can do that
is to prove they exist.

03:29.519 --> 03:30.934
And the quickest way
to do that--

03:30.969 --> 03:32.246
-Attract them with the scent.

03:32.281 --> 03:34.041
-And take photographs.

03:34.075 --> 03:35.594
-We need to tell your mother.

03:35.629 --> 03:37.458
-What, so she can nag us
for an hour and say

03:37.493 --> 03:39.011
how it's all my fault?

03:39.046 --> 03:41.359
-Me and Rhydian can get the
canisters before Shannon even

03:41.393 --> 03:42.670
leaves the village.

03:42.705 --> 03:44.914
-Yes, but what if they're
damaged or leaking?

03:44.948 --> 03:47.330
-Dad, I'm not a kid anymore.

03:47.365 --> 03:48.366
I made this mess.

03:48.400 --> 03:50.885
Just please, let
us clean it up.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.578
-Maddy, you are grounded.

03:53.612 --> 03:55.959
And you are not going
anywhere.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.934
[rustling sounds]

04:59.885 --> 05:02.440
-So they haven't made it
completely human, then.

05:02.474 --> 05:03.130
-Who are you?

05:03.164 --> 05:05.684
-You know who I am.

05:05.719 --> 05:06.478
-You smell like--

05:06.513 --> 05:08.342
-Like you.

05:08.377 --> 05:11.103
I'm Bryn, your brother.

05:11.138 --> 05:12.898
And I've come to
take you home.

05:15.763 --> 05:18.835
-You and Rhydian gave Tom
and Shannon a picture

05:18.870 --> 05:20.561
of you in wolf form?

05:20.596 --> 05:21.631
What were you thinking?

05:21.666 --> 05:23.633
-I was thinking of
me friends--

05:23.668 --> 05:25.877
you know the ones who
saved us from Kyle.

05:25.911 --> 05:28.466
-Who are now going to call
the authorities.

05:28.500 --> 05:29.881
-Shannon doesn't
mean any harm.

05:29.915 --> 05:32.021
-Humans never do, Maddy.

05:32.055 --> 05:33.402
But it can still end badly.

05:33.436 --> 05:35.438
I know it's good to
have friends.

05:35.473 --> 05:38.683
But your pack, your own kind,
they have to come first.

05:38.717 --> 05:39.477
[phone ringing]

05:39.511 --> 05:40.374
-It's Rhydian.

05:40.409 --> 05:42.514
-Oh, what's he done now?

05:42.549 --> 05:44.136
-Nothing.

05:44.171 --> 05:46.829
Hello?

05:46.863 --> 05:48.486
Your what?

05:48.520 --> 05:49.625
-My little brother.

05:49.659 --> 05:52.697
Isn't that a nice surprise?

05:52.731 --> 05:53.629
Stop it, Bryn.

05:53.663 --> 05:54.975
-Is Ceri there?

05:55.009 --> 05:56.045
-Ceri?

05:56.079 --> 05:57.874
What's going on, Maddy?

05:57.909 --> 05:58.737
-Is that your dad?

05:58.772 --> 06:00.049
-Yeah.

06:00.083 --> 06:01.809
Rhydian's little brother
showed up.

06:01.844 --> 06:03.466
-Oh, wonderful, another one.

06:05.951 --> 06:07.850
-Why didn't Ceri tell me I
have a little brother?

06:07.884 --> 06:10.784
-I don't know, maybe she thought
one shock was enough.

06:10.818 --> 06:12.855
-He keeps saying come
to take me home.

06:12.889 --> 06:16.168
But what part of, no, I don't
want to live in a cave did

06:16.203 --> 06:17.446
Ceri not understand?

06:17.480 --> 06:18.585
-Look, I don't know.

06:18.619 --> 06:20.863
Just stay with your
little brother.

06:20.897 --> 06:22.174
Try and figure it out.

06:22.209 --> 06:25.937
I've got family issues of
me own to deal with.

06:25.971 --> 06:28.008
-Brother?

06:28.042 --> 06:30.148
-Are you coming with me then?

06:30.182 --> 06:31.770
-Where's Ceri.

06:31.805 --> 06:35.671
-Don't know, tracking
me, probably.

06:35.705 --> 06:38.467
-What, so you've come
on your own?

06:38.501 --> 06:42.816
-I heard Mum, she said
where you live.

06:42.850 --> 06:45.025
I left when she was sleeping.

06:45.059 --> 06:46.820
-So you ran away from
home to find me?

06:46.854 --> 06:47.993
-Why else would I be here.

06:51.687 --> 06:53.274
-Come on, let's go to my place.

06:53.309 --> 06:56.105
-No.

06:56.139 --> 06:57.658
-It's not safe here.

06:57.693 --> 06:59.108
There's a canister.

06:59.142 --> 07:01.766
It's got something in it that
makes wolfbloods go out of

07:01.800 --> 07:02.905
control, like a scent.

07:05.597 --> 07:07.012
-But that's human world.

07:10.119 --> 07:11.638
-It's not as scary
as it looks.

07:11.672 --> 07:12.880
-I'm not scared.

07:12.915 --> 07:15.814
If you want to go to human
world, let's go.

07:21.717 --> 07:22.890
-Hello?

07:22.925 --> 07:24.029
Is anybody home?

07:26.791 --> 07:29.690
They must still be
out at work.

07:29.725 --> 07:32.935
I suppose this is a
bit weird for you.

07:32.969 --> 07:36.007
-[gasps]

07:36.041 --> 07:37.560
-It's weird for me, too.

07:37.595 --> 07:40.183
Just don't touch anything.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.495
-Have you got any meats?

07:41.530 --> 07:43.497
-Uh, meat?

07:43.532 --> 07:44.671
Yeah.

07:46.569 --> 07:48.985
How about a burger?

07:49.020 --> 07:50.193
-They're made out of ice.

07:50.228 --> 07:51.643
-I haven't cooked them yet.

07:51.678 --> 07:52.644
-Can't we just hunt?

07:52.679 --> 07:53.714
-No.

07:53.749 --> 07:54.232
Look, you'll like
these, trust me.

08:00.100 --> 08:01.032
-Blah.

08:01.066 --> 08:02.171
-Oh, Bryn.

08:08.280 --> 08:10.697
So you live in the
wild with Ceri?

08:10.731 --> 08:12.077
-Our mum.

08:12.112 --> 08:13.182
-Any other brothers and sisters
I should know about?

08:13.216 --> 08:14.494
-No.

08:16.565 --> 08:16.944
-Any--

08:16.979 --> 08:17.807
any dad?

08:17.842 --> 08:19.015
-Fathers come and go.

08:19.050 --> 08:20.189
Mothers stay.

08:20.223 --> 08:21.259
Mothers take care of you.

08:21.293 --> 08:22.122
-[scoffs]

08:22.156 --> 08:23.744
Not me.

08:23.779 --> 08:26.575
-All she ever talked about was
finding your, her lost child,

08:26.609 --> 08:28.059
taken by humans--

08:28.093 --> 08:31.545
how, when he transformed, she'd
bring him back home.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.339
[phone ringing]

08:32.373 --> 08:33.823
-[gasps]

08:33.857 --> 08:35.722
[crashing noises]

08:35.756 --> 08:38.966
[phone ringing]

08:39.001 --> 08:40.830
[laughter]

08:46.008 --> 08:47.319
-That's it.

08:47.354 --> 08:48.597
We're going without them.

08:52.014 --> 08:54.361
-I wasn't sneaking out
of being grounded.

08:54.395 --> 08:55.707
I told Dad why.

08:55.742 --> 08:57.191
-Yeah, after I'd caught you.

08:57.226 --> 08:59.055
-All those years we've told to
hide the truth, we weren't

08:59.090 --> 09:00.816
doing it to spoil your fun.

09:00.850 --> 09:03.128
There are people out there that
would harm wolfbloods if

09:03.163 --> 09:04.198
they could.

09:04.233 --> 09:05.268
-And you don't think
I know that?

09:05.303 --> 09:06.856
I've kept this secret,
haven't I?

09:06.891 --> 09:08.340
-Yeah, no thanks to Rhydian.

09:08.375 --> 09:09.307
-Yeah.

09:09.341 --> 09:10.653
First there was Linda's farm.

09:10.688 --> 09:11.343
-He didn't know any better.

09:11.378 --> 09:13.414
-Not at first, no.

09:13.449 --> 09:15.106
-Get all the windows and
the doors locked.

09:15.140 --> 09:17.764
We're staying here till its
safe, till Shannon's used all

09:17.798 --> 09:18.972
the scent off.

09:19.006 --> 09:20.698
-Rhydian is out there
with his brother.

09:20.732 --> 09:22.700
-Rhydian's no longer
our problem.

09:22.734 --> 09:24.149
-What?

09:24.184 --> 09:26.704
You were the ones that were
like, oh, let's help him.

09:26.738 --> 09:28.257
-He's out of control, Maddy.

09:28.291 --> 09:30.604
Sooner or later, he's
going to get caught.

09:30.639 --> 09:32.364
And we're not having you
going down with him.

09:32.399 --> 09:34.090
-It's the only way
to keep you safe.

09:34.125 --> 09:35.989
-Well, I'm not going to
let you abandon him!

09:36.023 --> 09:37.646
-Well, it's not your
choice any more.

09:37.680 --> 09:39.406
Get to your room
and stay there!

09:47.414 --> 09:51.038
-Look, Bryn, I've already told
Ceri I'm not going with her.

09:51.073 --> 09:52.453
What makes you think I'm going
to change my mind?

09:52.488 --> 09:55.111
-You have to, for
your own good.

09:55.146 --> 09:57.389
Humans are the tame
wolfbloods.

09:57.424 --> 09:58.459
They're corrupting you.

09:58.494 --> 09:59.391
-Did Ceri tell you that?

09:59.426 --> 10:01.704
-Stop calling her that.

10:01.739 --> 10:03.430
She's your mum.

10:03.464 --> 10:05.432
You've been hiding what
you are too long.

10:05.466 --> 10:06.813
You think you're one of them.

10:06.847 --> 10:09.678
-I am one of them, sort of.

10:09.712 --> 10:11.783
I know it's going to disappoint
you, Bryn, but I

10:11.818 --> 10:12.715
like it here.

10:12.750 --> 10:14.717
-I don't care what you like.

10:14.752 --> 10:15.994
She was gone for weeks.

10:16.029 --> 10:16.926
-Ceri?

10:16.961 --> 10:18.341
-Mum.

10:18.376 --> 10:22.035
Since coming home without
you, she's not the same.

10:22.069 --> 10:23.415
She doesn't hunt.

10:23.450 --> 10:25.348
She hardly notices me.

10:25.383 --> 10:28.248
You're the only thing she
thinks about anymore.

10:28.282 --> 10:30.422
I want my mother back
the way she was.

10:30.457 --> 10:34.668
And the only way to get that
is to bring you home.

10:34.703 --> 10:36.808
FEMALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
Rhydian, what's all this?

10:36.843 --> 10:38.396
-That's my foster mom.

10:38.430 --> 10:39.984
We should have cleaned
up downstairs.

10:40.018 --> 10:41.468
-If you're in trouble, you'll
have to leave with me.

10:41.502 --> 10:43.401
-I'm not in that much trouble.

10:43.435 --> 10:44.885
FEMALE SPEAKER [OFFSCREEN]:
Rhydian!

10:44.920 --> 10:46.059
Rhydian!

10:52.272 --> 10:53.411
-Come on.

10:56.448 --> 10:59.762
-You really don't trust
us, don't you?

10:59.797 --> 11:01.212
-Not today, Maddy, no.

11:01.246 --> 11:02.972
-Am I allowed to speak
to Dad, then?

11:03.007 --> 11:05.216
-Do whatever you want, Maddy, as
long as it's in this house.

11:08.253 --> 11:18.298
[buzz saw humming]

11:18.298 --> 11:31.967
[buzz saw humming]

11:37.248 --> 11:39.215
-Does this mean you're
coming with me?

11:39.250 --> 11:39.871
-No.

11:39.906 --> 11:40.872
-No?

11:40.907 --> 11:42.080
-She'll cool off
in a few hours.

11:42.115 --> 11:43.530
-She's not your mother.

11:43.564 --> 11:44.358
-[sighs]

11:44.393 --> 11:45.325
Bryn, listen to me.

11:45.359 --> 11:46.982
I know what you're say, I do.

11:47.016 --> 11:49.363
But I can't just leave my life
to live a new one with you.

11:49.398 --> 11:50.951
-You will come with me.

11:50.986 --> 11:51.434
-No, I won't.

11:51.469 --> 11:52.021
-Will!

11:52.056 --> 11:52.953
-Won't.

11:52.988 --> 11:53.436
-Well, I'll make you come.

11:53.471 --> 11:54.575
-How?

11:54.610 --> 11:57.993
-By telling people what
you really are.

11:58.027 --> 11:59.339
-Bryn.

11:59.373 --> 12:00.858
[sighs]

12:03.792 --> 12:04.551
-This is it.

12:04.585 --> 12:06.380
This is the place.

12:06.415 --> 12:07.554
-Uh, I threw it over there.

12:16.114 --> 12:18.530
-Does anyone here
know my brother?

12:18.565 --> 12:19.808
His name's Rhydian.

12:19.842 --> 12:20.498
-Rhydian?

12:20.532 --> 12:21.568
-He's a wolfblood.

12:21.602 --> 12:22.396
-A what?

12:22.431 --> 12:23.570
-Wolfblood.

12:25.572 --> 12:26.953
-Is he your brother?

12:26.987 --> 12:27.781
-I didn't know you
had a brother.

12:27.816 --> 12:28.886
-What's a wolfblood?

12:28.920 --> 12:30.819
-Is that a name, Rhydian
Wolfblood?

12:30.853 --> 12:32.406
-He's a new foster placement.

12:32.441 --> 12:33.822
He's winding you all up.

12:33.856 --> 12:36.307
It's time to go, Bryn.

12:36.341 --> 12:37.618
-I'm his real brother.

12:37.653 --> 12:39.379
I come from the far north,
from the [inaudible]

12:39.413 --> 12:41.553
wolfblood to bring him back
where he belongs.

12:41.588 --> 12:43.003
-Do they have baths up there?

12:43.038 --> 12:44.004
-He's quite good.

12:44.039 --> 12:45.074
-Did you write this for him?

12:45.109 --> 12:46.524
-Did you put him up to this?

12:46.558 --> 12:47.905
-I'm not being funny or
anything, but is this kid all

12:47.939 --> 12:48.560
right in the head?

12:48.595 --> 12:49.561
-I'm serious.

12:49.596 --> 12:50.528
Rhydian's not like you.

12:50.562 --> 12:52.254
-Yeah, he's got that right.

12:52.288 --> 12:53.842
-Rhydian's a wolfblood.

12:53.876 --> 12:55.844
He belongs in the wilderness
where the wolf runs free.

12:55.878 --> 12:57.121
-All right, son,
that's enough.

12:57.155 --> 12:58.536
It's a cafe, not a theater.

12:58.570 --> 12:59.537
-It's true.

12:59.571 --> 13:00.538
We're wolfbloods.

13:00.572 --> 13:02.333
He changes on the full moon.

13:02.367 --> 13:03.472
He's a wolf.

13:08.615 --> 13:10.444
-Are you going to take
him out, or shall I?

13:10.479 --> 13:12.067
-Let's go home, Bryn.

13:12.101 --> 13:12.584
-[grunts]

13:12.619 --> 13:16.278
[howling]

13:16.312 --> 13:18.867
-Did you know the Vaughans
had a special needs kid?

13:18.901 --> 13:20.627
-Don't smell very
special to me.

13:23.319 --> 13:24.424
-Bryn.

13:24.458 --> 13:27.358
Bryn, it's all right.

13:27.392 --> 13:28.428
They didn't mean any harm.

13:28.462 --> 13:29.670
-You were right.

13:29.705 --> 13:32.397
You are one of them, a fake,
a pretend human.

13:32.432 --> 13:33.536
-Bryn.

13:33.571 --> 13:34.503
-Go laugh with your
human friends.

13:34.537 --> 13:35.469
That's where you belong now.

13:39.922 --> 13:40.923
-I'd say he's got that right.

13:40.958 --> 13:42.304
[laughter]

13:42.338 --> 13:45.997
-You thank you're funny,
laughing at a confused kid?

13:46.032 --> 13:48.551
That's what you're all
like, isn't it?

13:48.586 --> 13:50.450
You see someone different to
you, and treat him like a

13:50.484 --> 13:53.108
joke, because deep down you're
scared of anyone who isn't

13:53.142 --> 13:56.214
exactly like you.

13:56.249 --> 13:58.492
-Things were a lot quieter
before that lad moved here.

14:01.392 --> 14:08.399
[buzz saw humming]

14:08.433 --> 14:10.435
-Where's Maddy?

14:10.470 --> 14:11.160
-What?

14:11.195 --> 14:12.023
-Where's Maddy?

14:12.058 --> 14:13.231
-I haven't seen her.

14:13.266 --> 14:16.303
I thought she was with you.

14:16.338 --> 14:31.077
[sighs]

14:31.111 --> 14:32.423
-I've got it.

14:32.457 --> 14:33.596
-Nice one, Shannon.

14:33.631 --> 14:34.908
Is it damaged?

14:34.943 --> 14:36.013
-Don't think so.

14:36.047 --> 14:37.255
-Are you going to
let it off now?

14:37.290 --> 14:40.155
-Well, we are here to
see the wolves, Tom.

14:40.189 --> 14:41.328
-Yeah, I suppose.

14:58.414 --> 14:59.588
-What do you want, human?

14:59.622 --> 15:01.176
-To see if you're OK.

15:01.210 --> 15:02.418
-Why would you care?

15:02.453 --> 15:04.696
-I might not be what you
and Ceri want me to be.

15:04.731 --> 15:05.697
But I'm still your family.

15:05.732 --> 15:07.078
I'm still your brother.

15:07.113 --> 15:08.459
-My human brother.

15:08.493 --> 15:09.943
-Humans aren't evil, Bryn.

15:09.978 --> 15:11.255
They might not understand
us, but that doesn't

15:11.289 --> 15:12.601
make them our enemy.

15:12.635 --> 15:15.052
-There's a bit of human
in all of us, you too.

15:15.086 --> 15:18.469
There's just a bit more
wolfblood in you, that's all.

15:18.503 --> 15:21.058
You know?

15:21.092 --> 15:22.991
-It's Mum.

15:23.025 --> 15:24.164
She's coming for us.

15:37.177 --> 15:38.144
-Oh, no.

15:38.178 --> 15:39.283
Bryn, stay here.

16:36.271 --> 16:40.102
[growling]

16:40.137 --> 16:41.862
-Are we going insane?

16:41.897 --> 16:43.692
-We're not insane, Tom.

16:43.726 --> 16:46.695
We never were.

16:46.729 --> 16:52.011
[growling]

16:52.011 --> 16:56.739
[growling]

17:13.308 --> 17:25.699
[growling]

17:25.733 --> 17:26.804
-Enough!

17:26.838 --> 17:28.116
I said, enough.

17:34.812 --> 17:35.916
-Mum.

17:35.951 --> 17:38.091
-Where have you been,
you foolish boy?

17:38.126 --> 17:40.197
Don't you ever run off again.

17:40.231 --> 17:42.613
-I'm sorry.

17:42.647 --> 17:43.924
-It's OK.

17:43.959 --> 17:45.098
It's the chemicals.

17:45.133 --> 17:46.375
It makes you see things.

17:46.410 --> 17:47.204
It's not really--

17:47.238 --> 17:47.756
-Oh, give it up, Maddy.

17:47.790 --> 17:49.171
They know.

17:49.206 --> 17:52.140
This is my mum, Ceri, and
my brother, Bryn.

17:52.174 --> 17:55.108
We're all wolfbloods.

17:55.143 --> 17:56.247
-Like Maddy?

18:01.425 --> 18:02.391
-What happened?

18:02.426 --> 18:03.323
-Your secret's out.

18:03.358 --> 18:04.324
-You did this.

18:04.359 --> 18:05.532
We invite you into our pack.

18:05.567 --> 18:06.844
And you've destroyed
everything.

18:06.878 --> 18:07.500
MADDY [OFFSCREEN]: Stop it!

18:07.534 --> 18:07.914
-Stop it!

18:07.948 --> 18:09.088
Mum!

18:14.162 --> 18:14.748
-You need to leave
our territory.

18:14.783 --> 18:16.681
-Mom, no!

18:16.716 --> 18:19.615
-It's all right, Maddy.

18:19.650 --> 18:20.444
She's right.

18:20.478 --> 18:21.583
I don't belong here.

18:21.617 --> 18:23.447
I've got a pack of my own.

18:28.866 --> 18:30.109
-My son.

18:38.669 --> 18:40.326
-Listen.

18:40.360 --> 18:43.812
Shannon, I wanted to tell you.

18:43.846 --> 18:46.159
Tom, if you just give us
a chance to explain.

18:46.194 --> 18:47.160
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: That's
it, Maddy.

18:47.195 --> 18:48.299
We're going now.

18:52.752 --> 18:53.856
Get in.

19:08.043 --> 19:09.734
-Just go home, Tom, I'm fine.

19:09.769 --> 19:10.425
-Fine?

19:10.459 --> 19:11.322
You're fine.

19:11.357 --> 19:11.771
I mean, we're both fine--

19:11.805 --> 19:12.668
not.

19:12.703 --> 19:13.428
-What do you want from me?

19:13.462 --> 19:14.429
-I don't know.

19:14.463 --> 19:15.533
Just don't do anything stupid.

19:15.568 --> 19:16.776
-Stupid?

19:16.810 --> 19:17.880
Yeah, stupid Shannon and
her stupid stories.

19:17.915 --> 19:19.503
-I didn't mean it like that.

19:19.537 --> 19:21.746
-She lied to us,
Tom, for years.

19:21.781 --> 19:23.265
-Yeah, but a secret like that?

19:23.300 --> 19:26.958
-We were supposed to be
her best friends.

19:26.993 --> 19:29.927
And all this time she treats
us like idiots.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.791
Well, guess what, this
time I'm going to

19:31.825 --> 19:33.310
do the right thing.

19:33.344 --> 19:34.656
-Shannon?

19:34.690 --> 19:35.760
-For the first time ever,
something weird on the

19:35.795 --> 19:37.590
moors.com has a genuine
exclusive.

19:41.456 --> 19:42.422
DANIEL [OFFSCREEN]:
Just take the

19:42.457 --> 19:43.941
essentials and the valuables.

19:43.975 --> 19:46.392
EMMA [OFFSCREEN]: We'll go to
Mike and Laura's, Maddy.

19:46.426 --> 19:50.396
Did you tell anyone about
our friends in Devon?

19:50.430 --> 19:52.018
Come on, Maddy, you've
got to pack.

19:52.052 --> 19:54.779
Shannon's photographs will
be online by now.

19:54.814 --> 19:56.195
Come on, Maddy, we've
got to go.

20:09.553 --> 20:10.968
-This is it, Tom.

20:11.002 --> 20:12.590
We're going to rock the
world with these.

20:12.625 --> 20:15.973
RHYDIAN [OFFSCREEN]: You
can't do that to Maddy.

20:16.007 --> 20:19.010
-You think you know what it's
like to be different, Shannon,

20:19.045 --> 20:21.496
to be the outsider.

20:21.530 --> 20:27.329
You have no idea, how scared
we are of being discovered,

20:27.364 --> 20:29.711
living on the run,
being captured

20:29.745 --> 20:31.540
and locked in a cage--

20:31.575 --> 20:35.579
how much we just wish we were
normal, like you two.

20:35.613 --> 20:36.580
-How's Maddy?

20:36.614 --> 20:37.753
-Don't know.

20:37.788 --> 20:40.963
So I'm going to leave
with my family.

20:40.998 --> 20:41.999
And I expect she is, too.

20:42.033 --> 20:42.793
-What, because of us?

20:42.827 --> 20:44.657
-No, the truth.

20:44.691 --> 20:47.487
It won't be long before all
kinds of people know.

20:47.522 --> 20:49.558
Some people will be
worse than Kyle.

20:49.593 --> 20:51.353
Thanks for saving us from him.

20:51.388 --> 20:52.561
-So it was you two?

20:56.876 --> 20:59.292
-You did the right thing then.

20:59.327 --> 21:00.914
Do the right thing now.

21:18.069 --> 21:19.347
-Oh, Maddy.

21:27.700 --> 21:31.704
Leaving is the hardest thing
we'll ever have to do.

21:31.738 --> 21:34.603
But I promise you one thing--

21:34.638 --> 21:37.468
it'll be all right in the end.

21:37.503 --> 21:38.400
You're can have a new life.

21:38.435 --> 21:39.159
And you'll be happy again.

21:39.194 --> 21:40.471
I promise.

21:45.718 --> 21:49.411
[knocking]

21:49.446 --> 21:50.550
-Stay here.

21:55.659 --> 21:58.696
-Um, hi, Mr. Smith.

22:04.219 --> 22:05.496
-I think you should have this.

22:17.577 --> 22:18.578
-What are you doing here?

22:18.613 --> 22:21.409
-Shannon's got something
for you.

22:21.443 --> 22:22.582
-That's all the photos I took.

22:25.551 --> 22:26.448
-All of them?

22:26.483 --> 22:28.001
-All of them.

22:28.036 --> 22:28.968
-Thanks.

22:29.002 --> 22:30.072
-Nothing is going on my blog.

22:30.107 --> 22:31.936
I'm closing the whole
site down.

22:31.971 --> 22:33.041
-Why?

22:33.075 --> 22:34.214
-Because you're our
friend, Mads.

22:34.249 --> 22:36.872
And that's supposed
to mean something.

22:36.907 --> 22:39.496
-Do you want a drink?

22:39.530 --> 22:40.462
-No, thanks.

22:40.497 --> 22:41.394
-Well, I do.

22:41.429 --> 22:41.843
Daniel?

22:41.877 --> 22:44.466
-Yeah.

22:44.501 --> 22:46.054
Oh, I'll give you a hand.

22:48.850 --> 22:50.541
-Rhydian said you
were leaving.

22:50.576 --> 22:51.922
-You've seen him?

22:51.956 --> 22:54.096
-He came to mine.

22:54.131 --> 22:58.791
I was loading the photos onto my
site, offline at the time.

22:58.825 --> 22:59.964
You should have trusted us.

22:59.999 --> 23:01.552
I wouldn't have told anyone.

23:01.587 --> 23:02.933
-I'm sorry.

23:02.967 --> 23:03.899
-And you could have told us
anytime you wanted to.

23:03.934 --> 23:05.418
But you didn't, Mads.

23:05.453 --> 23:06.419
-You're right.

23:06.454 --> 23:07.455
You're me best friends.

23:07.489 --> 23:08.663
And I should have trusted you.

23:08.697 --> 23:11.528
-So trust us now.

23:11.562 --> 23:12.460
But you don't have to go.

23:12.494 --> 23:14.496
We won't tell anyone.

23:14.531 --> 23:15.670
-Who'd believe us anyway?

23:22.055 --> 23:23.194
-Thank you.

23:29.960 --> 23:31.893
So where's Rhydian, if--

23:31.927 --> 23:33.066
if you've seen him?

23:40.108 --> 23:41.247
He's gone.

23:51.947 --> 23:53.086
He's really gone.

23:55.606 --> 23:57.505
-He loved you, Maddy.

23:57.539 --> 24:00.128
You do know that.

24:00.162 --> 24:03.234
-He told you that?

24:03.269 --> 24:04.546
-He didn't have to.

24:09.620 --> 24:14.625
