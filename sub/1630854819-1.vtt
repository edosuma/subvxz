Colonel Bach?

39:20.925 --> 39:25.496
I met him here,
Buenos Aires,

39:25.496 --> 39:28.766
maybe a year ago.
(CHUCKLES)

39:29.467 --> 39:31.001
At a Christmas party.

39:32.803 --> 39:34.271
Wait, he's here?

39:34.271 --> 39:36.707
No, no, no.
He lives in Bolivia.

39:38.342 --> 39:41.645
Tell me where
or I start shooting.

39:41.645 --> 39:46.150
And then, you will
just waltz across
miles of mountains

39:46.150 --> 39:49.353
and deserts and knock
on his door

39:49.353 --> 39:51.689
and shoot him
without any confrontation?

39:53.324 --> 39:58.195
The Germans have
thousands of guards

39:58.195 --> 40:00.364
protecting their
interests here.

40:00.364 --> 40:02.533
If you are bumbling around
the desert,

40:02.533 --> 40:06.704
they will find you
long before you'll find him.

40:06.704 --> 40:10.040
If you want Colonel Bach,

40:10.040 --> 40:12.810
you're going to need me
to help you find him.

40:12.810 --> 40:14.845
In exchange for what?

40:15.446 --> 40:16.781
As it happens,

40:17.481 --> 40:19.216
we have mutual interests.

40:20.217 --> 40:21.952
I also have to get to Bolivia.

40:23.187 --> 40:25.389
We travel there together.

40:25.389 --> 40:29.527

we play your little game.

40:29.527 --> 40:34.732

deaf Swiss father

40:34.732 --> 40:38.302

selling bananas.

40:38.302 --> 40:40.070
What threats?

40:40.070 --> 40:44.141
Machine gun-toting women from
Jerusalem or the equivalent.

40:45.342 --> 40:46.844
Why me?

40:46.844 --> 40:49.647
Why not these other Germans
if there's so many of them?

40:49.647 --> 40:53.484
Well, the Germans
want me dead, too.
It's, uh...

40:54.418 --> 40:56.554
It's complicated.

40:56.554 --> 40:58.155
But the Soviets don't.

40:58.856 --> 41:01.358
That envelope,

41:01.358 --> 41:03.928

of a contact

41:03.928 --> 41:06.263
that was going to get me
to safety in Moscow.

41:07.331 --> 41:10.434
He is at a remote airfield
in Bolivia.

41:12.203 --> 41:16.707
And as it happens,
that airfield is not

41:16.707 --> 41:20.644
very far from your
Colonel Martin Bach.

41:22.513 --> 41:24.448
If you want your German,

41:25.249 --> 41:26.951
get me to my Russian.

41:28.619 --> 41:30.287
How are we getting there?

41:30.287 --> 41:32.423
The next boat
leaves in five hours.

41:48.739 --> 41:51.842
We made it to the mouth
of the river here
headed north.

41:51.842 --> 41:56.046
Germans are watching
the airfields
and major ports,

41:57.781 --> 42:03.454
but we can putter up
to Paraguay undetected.

42:03.454 --> 42:06.123
The capital of Asuncion
is a risk, but if we make it,

42:06.123 --> 42:09.493
we can take the back roads
all the way to Bolivia.

42:09.493 --> 42:11.929
I'd rather fly,
but it's probably safer

42:11.929 --> 42:15.499
to hire a native to guide us
to the rendezvous.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.403

Nothing.

42:37.521 --> 42:39.723
I am an atomic physicist.

42:39.723 --> 42:43.127
One of the better ones
in the world.

42:43.127 --> 42:46.730
I was part of a team
developing the atom bomb
for Germany.

42:48.465 --> 42:51.835
The Soviets are recruiting me
to work for them.

42:51.835 --> 42:53.904
And she's trying
to stop you?

42:53.904 --> 42:59.577
She works
for a spy agency
called Mossad.

42:59.577 --> 43:02.980
Jerusalem is trying
to extradite me
to hang for war crimes,

43:04.882 --> 43:09.253
but bigger problem
is that the Germans here,

43:10.321 --> 43:11.622
they have no use for me.

43:12.489 --> 43:14.391
They would rather kill me

43:15.559 --> 43:17.461
to keep me from helping
the Russians

43:18.562 --> 43:19.630
or the Americans.

43:21.999 --> 43:23.400
That's tragic.

43:23.400 --> 43:25.235
The Nazis are trying
to kill me.

43:26.103 --> 43:27.805
That ought to make me
your friend.

43:27.805 --> 43:29.873
You made bombs for Hitler.

43:29.873 --> 43:33.077
You sit at a table with Nazis,
that makes you a Nazi.

43:35.012 --> 43:37.047

43:37.047 --> 43:40.584
is not responsible
for the man who uses it.

43:40.584 --> 43:43.988
If I make a, um,
butter knife

43:43.988 --> 43:46.523
and you stick it
in someone's throat,

43:46.523 --> 43:48.125
does that make me a murderer?

43:48.125 --> 43:49.560
Butter knife?

43:49.560 --> 43:52.596
Hitler would've used
your atom bomb on civilians.

43:52.596 --> 43:55.232
Which your country
did twice, I believe, yes?

43:55.232 --> 43:56.667
That's different.

43:56.667 --> 43:59.603
We're not Hitler.
We're the good guys.
