00:01.039 --> 00:02.539
Why are you here?

00:02.539 --> 00:03.939
It wasn't the rapture!

00:03.939 --> 00:06.139
They were no better than us! I have proof!

00:06.139 --> 00:08.639
Free of charge!

00:08.639 --> 00:10.639
She beat her children!

00:10.639 --> 00:12.339
It was not the rapture!

00:12.339 --> 00:13.339
Matt.

00:13.339 --> 00:14.539
Really need to do this today?

00:14.539 --> 00:15.539
Especially today.

00:15.539 --> 00:17.039
Next time you see your dad,

00:17.039 --> 00:18.639
you tell him he's off the hook.

00:18.639 --> 00:19.839
I will be sure and do that, Matt.

00:19.839 --> 00:22.839
I'm not asking for that
perfect day at the beach.

00:22.839 --> 00:26.239
Just give me all four of
us alive and together.

00:26.239 --> 00:28.239
A year ago, these people didn't even exist.

00:28.239 --> 00:30.239
Now there's almost 50 of them.

00:30.239 --> 00:31.239
Where did they come from?

00:31.239 --> 00:32.238
What do they want?

00:32.238 --> 00:33.839
You don't even know who they are.

00:33.839 --> 00:35.339
We know who they were.

00:35.339 --> 00:37.339
I'm trying to talk to my wife!

00:37.339 --> 00:38.739
Please come home.

00:39.356 --> 00:41.956
Do you even remember what it
feels like to care about anything?

00:41.956 --> 00:43.756

00:56.290 --> 01:01.411
This is the story of a... a little boy.

01:03.297 --> 01:06.249
I'd say, "Stop me if you've heard this one

01:06.300 --> 01:10.970
before," but you have, and I
don't really want to be stopped.

01:11.621 --> 01:13.321
_

01:13.390 --> 01:17.310
This boy, he's a good
kid; not perfect, but good,

01:17.344 --> 01:20.313
and when he's about 10 years old,

01:20.347 --> 01:23.349
his mom and dad tell him
he's gonna have a baby sister.

01:23.400 --> 01:26.152
And the baby sister comes,

01:26.186 --> 01:29.822
and of course he loves her very much.

01:29.857 --> 01:34.110
But... she's getting attention.

01:34.161 --> 01:36.629
His attention.

01:36.664 --> 01:39.115
So he wishes...

01:39.117 --> 01:42.118
actually... he prays

01:42.169 --> 01:45.622
for that attention back and...

01:45.673 --> 01:48.641
a month later, he's diagnosed

01:48.676 --> 01:51.711
with acute lymphatic leukemia.

01:54.214 --> 01:57.467
And the... cancer eats away at the boy

01:57.518 --> 02:00.703
until there is almost nothing left.

02:00.738 --> 02:03.189
But he fights it.

02:03.223 --> 02:06.693
He survives and...

02:06.727 --> 02:09.696
now he has a choice to make.

02:09.729 --> 02:11.648
Does he decide

02:11.699 --> 02:13.816
that he was punished

02:13.867 --> 02:16.319
or that he was rewarded?

02:16.370 --> 02:19.389
Will he be angry for
having been made to suffer,

02:19.423 --> 02:21.357
or will he be grateful

02:21.392 --> 02:23.876
for that suffering because...

02:23.911 --> 02:26.162
it changed him?

02:30.050 --> 02:33.670
This is the story of a little girl.

02:35.089 --> 02:37.557
She's 8 years old, and

02:37.591 --> 02:42.345
just over a week ago,
she's playing in the park.

02:42.347 --> 02:45.348
She loves to go high on the swings,

02:45.350 --> 02:49.852
up to the point where you hang
there for a moment, suspended,

02:49.854 --> 02:55.024
before the chains clink and
gravity pulls you back down.

02:57.578 --> 03:01.080
She's been asleep...

03:01.115 --> 03:03.116
in a coma,

03:03.167 --> 03:05.034
for 9 days now.

03:05.085 --> 03:08.087
Her brain activity is negligible.

03:08.122 --> 03:12.208
Her outcome is undetermined.

03:13.961 --> 03:17.547
The girl's name is Emily...

03:20.768 --> 03:25.388
and so that little boy is
asking for attention again now.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.276
For Emily,

03:30.310 --> 03:32.895
let us pray.

03:37.334 --> 03:39.769
Heavenly Father,

03:39.803 --> 03:43.406
You invite all who are
burdened to come to You.

03:44.608 --> 03:48.211
Allow Your healing hand to touch this girl.

03:49.580 --> 03:52.465
Fill her heart with Your courage

03:52.499 --> 03:55.551
and infinite love for
all that you create...

04:08.849 --> 04:10.600
Please.

04:12.236 --> 04:15.154
- Oh! Oh!
- Stop please!

04:18.992 --> 04:20.610
Oh...

04:24.659 --> 04:25.888
_

06:25.569 --> 06:27.537
Well, it's probably not a concussion.

06:27.571 --> 06:29.739
Doctor will want to take a
look at you before you can go.

06:29.741 --> 06:31.908
- Thanks.
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.377 --> 06:35.578
"Mrs. Amber Johnson,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.580
"a local pharmacist trainee,

06:37.631 --> 06:40.099
"secretly stole significant quantities

06:40.133 --> 06:42.919
"of Percocet, Oxycodone, and Vicodin

06:42.970 --> 06:45.421
and sold it to community college students."

06:45.472 --> 06:47.423
I know what it says.

06:47.474 --> 06:50.810
Amber here, she poof ed?

06:50.844 --> 06:53.312
She was a Departure, yes, mm-hmm.

06:53.347 --> 06:55.815
So you think our assailant knew Amber,

06:55.849 --> 06:58.234
maybe didn't appreciate
your little newsletter?

07:00.270 --> 07:01.771
I got this one, Lou.

07:01.822 --> 07:04.190
Chief, I was just taking his
statement. There's no need for...

07:04.224 --> 07:05.775
All right. Press charges, Matt?

07:05.777 --> 07:06.993
No.

07:07.027 --> 07:08.778
There you go.

07:10.163 --> 07:11.781
Father.

07:14.685 --> 07:16.619
Here we are again.

07:16.670 --> 07:18.287
Ahem.

07:19.623 --> 07:22.291
Occupational hazard. What are you gonna do?

07:22.342 --> 07:23.793
Stop pissin' people off.

07:23.844 --> 07:26.512
They need to hear the truth.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.631
Your dad understood that.

07:28.682 --> 07:31.300
Look where that got him.

07:34.104 --> 07:38.107
You know, me and Jill are living
in the old man's place now.

07:38.141 --> 07:41.110
Come over tonight, I'll
grill up some steaks,

07:41.144 --> 07:44.313
do a Sunday dinner like old times.

07:44.315 --> 07:47.900
Nights are tough for me.

07:47.951 --> 07:49.402
Mmm.

07:49.453 --> 07:50.870
Sorry.

07:59.162 --> 08:02.331
See you next time, Chief.

08:26.106 --> 08:29.191
Guess you and me are
going to the same place.

08:45.375 --> 08:47.376
You need help?

08:47.378 --> 08:49.345
Emily.

08:50.681 --> 08:54.300
The girl who was in here...
do you know what happened?

08:54.351 --> 08:56.552
She woke up,

08:56.603 --> 08:58.971
asked for a Sprite.

09:00.107 --> 09:02.058
Well, she's OK?

09:02.109 --> 09:04.560
I guess so. You know her?

09:04.562 --> 09:06.896
No, I visited with her, but

09:06.898 --> 09:09.398
my congregation...

09:09.449 --> 09:13.235
this morning, we prayed for her.

09:13.237 --> 09:16.288
Well, she woke up last night.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.232
Hello. You've reached the
administrative offices of Our Savior.

09:43.266 --> 09:45.434
Please leave a message
at the sound of the tone.

09:46.938 --> 09:49.371
Matt, hi. It's Jim Lewis from FDR.

09:49.406 --> 09:51.440
You're a hard man to reach.

09:51.442 --> 09:53.442
I'd really love to talk to you, in person,

09:53.444 --> 09:55.945
preferably, as soon as possible.

09:55.979 --> 09:58.948
I'm here at the bank
all day. Talk soon. Bye.

10:20.520 --> 10:22.471
Hey, hi.

10:22.473 --> 10:25.558
Um, are you open?

10:25.609 --> 10:27.760
Sure. Yeah. Come in.

10:29.146 --> 10:31.614
I don't know if you remember me.

10:31.648 --> 10:34.150
- I used to come all the time.
- Craig, right?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.734
McNary.

10:35.786 --> 10:38.654
Yeah. Sorry I haven't been in a while.

10:38.656 --> 10:41.157
My wife, ever since the 14th, she's not

10:41.159 --> 10:43.459
really into, you know...

10:45.212 --> 10:47.129
Anyway, she's over getting a manicure,

10:47.164 --> 10:49.131
and I told her to get her feet done, too,

10:49.166 --> 10:51.083
you know, just to take
some time for herself.

10:51.134 --> 10:54.170
I'd take the baby and come
back, pick her up later,

10:54.172 --> 10:56.172
so...

10:58.675 --> 11:01.177
How long does it take to do a,

11:01.179 --> 11:03.179
you know, a baptism?

11:47.724 --> 11:51.794
We... we have that
confidentiality thing, right?

11:51.828 --> 11:54.813
I'll try to keep my mouth shut.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.485
Oh, I... I don't know what the
appropriate contribution is...

11:59.536 --> 12:00.986
Please.

12:01.037 --> 12:02.988
It's on the house.

12:03.039 --> 12:05.124
You sure?

12:06.993 --> 12:08.911
How about you ask your wife to join

12:08.962 --> 12:11.497
you and your son for services this Sunday?

12:11.548 --> 12:14.466
We'll call it even.

12:14.501 --> 12:16.502
I don't think that's gonna happen.

12:16.553 --> 12:19.138
Heh! Had to try.

12:21.007 --> 12:24.143
If I don't, who will?

12:28.148 --> 12:30.599
This guy I worked with...

12:30.634 --> 12:32.601
he used to get loaded and drive out

12:32.603 --> 12:35.604
to the Indian casino in Connecticut.

12:35.606 --> 12:38.107
Gambled away his paycheck
every other Thursday.

12:38.109 --> 12:41.110
And when that was gone, I heard he...

12:41.112 --> 12:44.196
I heard he cleaned out
his kids' college account.

12:47.367 --> 12:49.535
He went on the 14th.

12:54.457 --> 12:57.042
What was his name?

12:59.846 --> 13:01.797
Andrew Sasaki.

13:04.302 --> 13:07.519
We don't discuss personal
information about our clientele.

13:07.554 --> 13:09.471
Sure. Of course not.

13:09.473 --> 13:12.975
This man, Mr. Sasaki, he was a Departure,

13:12.977 --> 13:16.278
and the reason I'm asking
about him is, uh... I'm sorry,

13:16.313 --> 13:20.482
I know this is personal, but did
you lose anyone close to you, sir?

13:24.237 --> 13:25.821
My niece.

13:27.290 --> 13:28.824
She was 9.

13:30.327 --> 13:32.328
May I show you something?

13:37.884 --> 13:40.002
This...

13:42.389 --> 13:44.974
is Albert Wayne Studdard.

13:45.008 --> 13:48.677
He abducted a young girl
walking home from school.

13:48.728 --> 13:51.847
Violated her sexually,
strangled her to death.

13:51.849 --> 13:55.351
On October 14th, he disappeared,

13:55.353 --> 13:57.853
right out of his jail cell.

13:57.855 --> 14:00.823
And this man, this monster,

14:00.857 --> 14:03.325
is on the same list
along with all the others

14:03.360 --> 14:06.862
who left us, along with
the innocent and the good...

14:06.913 --> 14:09.498
along with your niece.

14:10.867 --> 14:13.335
But someone has to expose these people

14:13.370 --> 14:16.338
for who they truly were
and what they truly did

14:16.373 --> 14:18.841
because if we can no longer separate

14:18.875 --> 14:21.293
the innocent from the guilty,

14:21.344 --> 14:24.880
everything that happened
to us, all of our suffering,

14:24.882 --> 14:26.849
is meaningless.

14:33.223 --> 14:36.225
I think I know what happened to your face.

14:36.227 --> 14:38.394
Can you help me?

14:39.813 --> 14:43.032
Well, we don't keep the
security cam data past 6 months,

14:43.066 --> 14:45.951
but I'll see what I can do.

14:45.985 --> 14:48.487
Jesus fucking Christ!

14:48.538 --> 14:49.905
Come on!

14:49.907 --> 14:52.958
What about the bet? What about the bet?

14:54.994 --> 14:57.396
Get outta here! Get outta here!

14:57.430 --> 15:00.632
I have to deal with
this. Get down to Pit 4.

15:00.667 --> 15:03.285
There's fuckin' birds on the table.

15:26.197 --> 15:28.197
_

15:38.338 --> 15:40.456
Oh.

16:04.114 --> 16:07.416
I'm sorry. I don't have any in white.

16:10.236 --> 16:13.238
I know you have a job to
do, but please tell Patti

16:13.289 --> 16:15.824
she's wasting your time sending you here.

16:15.826 --> 16:18.327
I've made it this far.

16:18.329 --> 16:21.997
I'm not gonna turn around now.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.058
Oh, Lord.

16:37.564 --> 16:39.648
What?

16:39.682 --> 16:42.151
Hello, Matt?

16:42.185 --> 16:45.604
Hey! Jim, is that you?

16:45.655 --> 16:48.357
I'm sorry. My phone's been acting up.

16:48.359 --> 16:51.360
Uh... how are you?

16:51.362 --> 16:53.712
Good. I'm good.

16:53.746 --> 16:57.282
Matt, I'm sure you're busy,
but can you come by the bank?

16:57.333 --> 16:58.367
Sure.

16:58.369 --> 17:00.369
- It's important.
- Yeah.

17:00.371 --> 17:02.788
I'll... come right over.

17:02.839 --> 17:04.790
Thank you!

17:09.762 --> 17:12.381
There's been an offer on the church.

17:13.766 --> 17:17.853
But... I don't understand.
You... you said I could stay.

17:17.887 --> 17:19.721
I said you could stay

17:19.771 --> 17:22.290
as long as no buyers came forward.

17:22.325 --> 17:24.726
I... I'm sorry, Matt.

17:24.728 --> 17:28.897
I've been trying to tell you
for at least two weeks now.

17:30.450 --> 17:33.035
Now, you always knew this could happen

17:33.069 --> 17:35.454
once you stopped making payments

17:35.488 --> 17:38.040
and we had to foreclose.

17:39.409 --> 17:41.243
Who's the buyer?

17:41.245 --> 17:43.045
Corporate LLC,

17:43.079 --> 17:45.797
probably a hedge fund.

17:45.832 --> 17:48.300
They can't really remodel,

17:48.334 --> 17:51.837
but the land is worth something.

17:53.306 --> 17:56.341
They probably want to knock it
down and throw up some apartments.

17:56.392 --> 17:58.594
Knock it...

17:58.645 --> 18:01.430
Well, it's not some restaurant.
This is a house of worsh...

18:06.486 --> 18:09.104
I'm sorry. I have to take this.

18:11.524 --> 18:12.941
Hey.

18:12.992 --> 18:14.493
Can I call you back?
I'm in the middle of a...

18:14.527 --> 18:16.495
We're out of bleach.

18:16.529 --> 18:18.614
What? Which kind?

18:18.665 --> 18:20.616
- Doesn't matter.
- Yeah.

18:20.667 --> 18:22.618
OK, I'll grab some on the way home.

18:22.669 --> 18:25.287
- Bye.
- Bye.

18:26.673 --> 18:28.790
How is Mary?

18:31.628 --> 18:34.296
Tell me how I can keep my church.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.133
With, uh, no other offers

18:38.135 --> 18:40.686
on the table, we have to accept theirs.

18:40.720 --> 18:43.639
But, now, if you can come in,

18:43.641 --> 18:46.608
all cash, even one dollar

18:46.643 --> 18:48.527
above their price,

18:48.561 --> 18:51.647
I can get your name back on the deed.

18:52.865 --> 18:54.983
What was their price?

18:57.704 --> 18:59.821
$135,000.

19:06.713 --> 19:09.331
How much time do I have?

19:11.217 --> 19:12.668
Tomorrow,

19:12.719 --> 19:14.303
end of day.

19:15.672 --> 19:17.673
Oh...

19:40.079 --> 19:41.580
- Hey, you.
- Hi.

19:41.614 --> 19:43.198
Hey.

19:48.037 --> 19:49.538
Bar fight?

19:51.041 --> 19:52.457
Am I interrupting anything?

19:52.508 --> 19:55.160
No, I was just watching TV. Come on in.

20:11.644 --> 20:13.995
Doug won't mind. I promise.

20:23.539 --> 20:25.490
Is Mary OK?

20:25.541 --> 20:28.126
She's... she's great.

20:30.046 --> 20:32.414
Then... what?

20:34.918 --> 20:38.587
I need to borrow $135,000.

20:39.972 --> 20:41.423
What?

20:41.474 --> 20:44.092
They're gonna sell the church.

20:51.484 --> 20:53.602
I'm sorry.

20:57.940 --> 20:59.941
I know it's a lot of money,

20:59.943 --> 21:01.910
but it'd just be a loan.

21:01.944 --> 21:04.413
Things are changing, people
are ready to come back.

21:04.447 --> 21:07.616
I just performed a baptism this morning.

21:08.951 --> 21:11.420
I hate coming to you,

21:11.454 --> 21:13.955
but this is our family church,

21:13.957 --> 21:15.674
Mom and Dad's...

21:15.708 --> 21:17.459
No, Matt, it's your church.

21:17.461 --> 21:18.627
They left it to both of us.

21:18.678 --> 21:20.629
They didn't leave it to anyone.

21:20.631 --> 21:23.298
They died in a fire when I
was 7, and then it was given...

21:23.349 --> 21:25.434
Please don't... don't get upset.

21:25.468 --> 21:27.969
- Why do you always have to do that?
- What?

21:27.971 --> 21:30.939
Make me upset and then
tell me not to get upset.

21:30.973 --> 21:33.191
You can't just knock on my
door and ask for $135,000...

21:33.226 --> 21:34.810
Do you not have it?

21:36.395 --> 21:39.030
I thought the benefit money...

21:42.034 --> 21:45.704
That money was for my
husband and my children.

21:49.325 --> 21:51.460
I'm sorry.

21:52.879 --> 21:54.796
You're right.

21:54.831 --> 21:58.300
I shouldn't have asked. I just...

21:58.334 --> 22:00.969
didn't know where to go.

22:09.679 --> 22:12.314
Will you stop making your paper?

22:13.432 --> 22:14.850
What?

22:14.901 --> 22:16.852
You're asking me for something.

22:16.936 --> 22:18.854
I'm asking you for something.

22:18.856 --> 22:21.823
Stop making your paper and
I'll give you the money.

22:21.858 --> 22:23.241
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

22:23.276 --> 22:24.493
People need to hear the tru...

22:24.527 --> 22:26.161
People need to punch you in the face!

22:26.195 --> 22:28.330
I didn't say it was easy to hear.

22:28.364 --> 22:30.115
Then deliver the truth in your church.

22:30.166 --> 22:31.833
That's what you're asking
me for, right, your church?

22:31.868 --> 22:33.535
- That's not what this is about.
- No!

22:33.537 --> 22:36.505
It's about the accident!
It's about the judge!

22:36.539 --> 22:39.508
And it should have ended
there, but you kept going!

22:39.542 --> 22:42.511
You dug up your dirt, and people
called you crazy behind your back,

22:42.545 --> 22:45.046
and I defended you because
I knew you were in pain,

22:45.048 --> 22:47.182
but then you decided it was your calling,

22:47.216 --> 22:49.885
your... your purpose, like you
were personally selected by God...

22:49.887 --> 22:52.637
Don't say that word! Don't say that word.

22:52.688 --> 22:56.057
You don't get to talk about
something you don't believe in.

22:56.059 --> 22:58.527
I don't get to?

22:58.561 --> 23:01.530
What do you believe in, Matt?

23:01.564 --> 23:05.066
Do you know where my family went?

23:05.068 --> 23:08.203
Do you know what it was?

23:13.242 --> 23:15.710
It was a test.

23:15.745 --> 23:17.746
Oh.

23:19.415 --> 23:21.583
Not for what came before,

23:21.585 --> 23:24.252
but for what came after.

23:24.303 --> 23:27.339
It was a test for what comes now.

23:27.390 --> 23:29.758
Well, if it was a test,

23:29.760 --> 23:32.928
then I think you may be failing it.

23:47.109 --> 23:49.744
I love you, Matt...

23:53.115 --> 23:55.617
but what you're doing...

23:55.619 --> 23:57.619
your paper, the church...

23:57.621 --> 24:00.121
it's not working anymore.

24:01.958 --> 24:05.126
It's not making things better.

24:07.597 --> 24:20.025
Maybe it's time to let it go.

24:20.059 --> 24:22.143
Hmm.

24:25.364 --> 24:27.782
Doug was having an affair.

24:34.156 --> 24:36.241
The kids' preschool teacher.

24:37.627 --> 24:40.745
They usually did it at her apartment.

24:42.665 --> 24:45.583
But a couple of times,

24:45.635 --> 24:49.254
he brought her to The Plaza in the city.

24:51.974 --> 24:55.894
He was smart enough to use cash, but...

24:55.928 --> 25:00.098
I have the receipts from
the ATM in their lobby.

25:05.971 --> 25:08.490
It's the one story I will never publish.

25:24.774 --> 25:27.542
I love you. I love you, too.

25:28.961 --> 25:30.595
OK.

25:46.696 --> 25:50.865
They're gone, but so much
of them is still here.

25:53.185 --> 25:56.738
You've tried to move on,
tried to live a normal life,

25:56.740 --> 25:59.207
but you haven't let go

25:59.241 --> 26:01.876
because you haven't known how.

26:03.379 --> 26:07.882
Loved Ones bereavement figures
allow you to say that good-bye.

26:09.668 --> 26:11.586
With as little as a single photograph,

26:11.588 --> 26:15.090
Loved Ones can create a tangible
likeness of your departed,

26:15.141 --> 26:17.592
a bereavement figure
for burial or cremation,

26:17.643 --> 26:20.095
allowing you and your family to finally...

26:20.146 --> 26:22.063
- Hey.
- Begin to feel hope again.

26:22.098 --> 26:24.099
Visit with a Loved Ones associate today

26:24.150 --> 26:25.650
or visit us online to receive this...

26:25.684 --> 26:27.652
Uh...

26:27.686 --> 26:30.488
this is the only kind they had,

26:30.523 --> 26:32.524
but bleach is bleach, right?

26:32.575 --> 26:34.159
Fine.

26:35.444 --> 26:37.746
Is everything OK?

26:37.780 --> 26:40.915
When you gonna pay me again, Mr. Matthew?

26:41.951 --> 26:44.419
Oh, uh... right.

26:44.453 --> 26:46.921
I'm sorry about that. I...

26:46.956 --> 26:48.957
I'd write you a check, but, uh,

26:48.959 --> 26:50.925
I've been moving money
between accounts and...

26:50.960 --> 26:53.962
Three weeks I work here for nothing.

26:53.964 --> 26:56.464
I know, I know. Uh, here.

26:56.515 --> 26:58.967
Take this.

26:59.018 --> 27:01.469
Uh...

27:01.471 --> 27:04.973
and I'll give you the rest when I can?

27:07.893 --> 27:10.311
Great. Thanks.

27:10.362 --> 27:12.864
If you can't pay me, I
can't do this anymore.

27:12.898 --> 27:15.066
You understand, yes?

27:15.117 --> 27:17.819
Yeah. I understand.

27:19.205 --> 27:22.157
She needs her bath.

27:46.899 --> 27:49.517
Hello, sweetheart.

29:49.466 --> 29:51.600
Help me.

30:26.425 --> 30:28.259
Thanks so much for doing this, Roxana.

30:28.311 --> 30:30.762
I... I never would have called
if it wasn't an emergency.

30:30.813 --> 30:32.347
Nights are overtime.

30:32.349 --> 30:34.316
Right, of course. Thank you.

30:34.350 --> 30:38.153
Mary's asleep upstairs. I just didn't
want to leave her here on her own.

30:38.187 --> 30:40.739
- How long will you be?
- Three, maybe 4 hours.

30:40.773 --> 30:43.074
Morning at the latest, and when I get back,

30:43.109 --> 30:45.243
I'm gonna pay you everything I owe you,

30:45.277 --> 30:47.996
all of it, tonight included.

30:50.833 --> 30:54.202
I'll come through this time.

30:54.253 --> 30:56.204
I swear.

32:07.109 --> 32:09.611
Uh, Kevin's dad,

32:09.613 --> 32:11.613
your
father-in-law,

32:11.615 --> 32:13.748
he left something here.

32:15.868 --> 32:18.169
For me.

32:20.339 --> 32:23.291
He said I could get it whenever I want it.

32:44.060 --> 32:47.060
_

32:47.733 --> 32:50.869
I won't say anything if you won't.

33:43.386 --> 33:46.386
_

33:50.160 --> 33:53.660
_

34:45.656 --> 34:47.123
Hello.

34:47.158 --> 34:48.775
Hello.

34:50.628 --> 34:52.629
How would you like it, sir?

34:52.663 --> 34:54.547
In chips.

34:55.917 --> 34:58.335
What denomination?

34:58.386 --> 35:00.971
Oh. Does it matter?

35:17.405 --> 35:20.023
20,000. Good luck.

35:42.130 --> 35:44.131
Would you like to bet?

35:44.133 --> 35:45.632
Yes.

35:45.683 --> 35:47.884
On red.

35:47.935 --> 35:50.303
Right there, sir.

36:02.150 --> 36:04.651
Uh, sir, our high-limit
tables are in the back.

36:04.653 --> 36:06.153
- If you'll allow me to escort you...
- No, I...

36:06.204 --> 36:08.288
I want to play on this table.

36:10.124 --> 36:11.708
Please.

36:19.667 --> 36:22.669
20,000 on red.

36:23.671 --> 36:25.755
No more bets.

36:36.067 --> 36:37.767
Winner. Red.

36:40.271 --> 36:42.355
40,000.

36:44.108 --> 36:46.026
Aw, shit!

36:46.028 --> 36:48.028
We got a player here.

36:48.030 --> 36:50.163
Again, please.

36:51.532 --> 36:53.667
Uh, heh heh!

36:55.586 --> 36:58.705
40,000 on red.

37:02.960 --> 37:04.427
No more bets.

37:18.025 --> 37:19.976
Awoo!

37:20.011 --> 37:22.479
Winner. Red.

37:22.530 --> 37:24.481
That is insane!

37:24.532 --> 37:26.449
Congratulations.

37:26.484 --> 37:28.451
- Jesus.
- 80,000.

37:35.209 --> 37:36.877
Once more, please.

37:36.911 --> 37:38.245
Jesus, man. Hey, whoa, whoa.

37:38.247 --> 37:40.747
You know something that we don't know?

37:40.749 --> 37:42.749
Gee, what the fuck are you do Tina?

37:42.751 --> 37:44.384
You're gonna jinx the
guy. That's a fucking jinx.

37:44.418 --> 37:46.386
- No, you bet with him.
- No, no, no. Black is due.

37:46.420 --> 37:47.637
Sorry.

37:49.674 --> 37:52.309
What do you need me to do?

37:58.482 --> 38:00.433
80,000 on red.

38:00.484 --> 38:02.435
Good luck.

38:16.701 --> 38:18.919
No more bets.

39:07.024 --> 39:08.942
$160,000.

39:08.993 --> 39:10.860
Congratulations, sir.

39:36.804 --> 39:38.888
Oh.

39:48.199 --> 39:49.532
Hey!

39:49.567 --> 39:52.068
Winner, winner, chicken dinner, right?

39:52.119 --> 39:54.120
- Heh!
- Yeah.

39:54.155 --> 39:55.572
Yeah, congrats, man.

39:55.623 --> 39:57.073
- Thanks.
- You were on fire.

39:57.124 --> 39:58.541
I never seen balls like that.

39:58.576 --> 40:00.043
I was trying to get my
girl over there not to bet

40:00.077 --> 40:01.744
against you, but she fuckin' ignored me.

40:01.795 --> 40:04.297
- I... I have to...
- Hey, listen, here's the thing, though.

40:04.331 --> 40:06.332
We dropped our last hundred,

40:06.383 --> 40:08.251
and we got to be in
Niagara Falls in the morning

40:08.302 --> 40:10.753
and that's at least two tanks
of gas, so I was just wondering

40:10.804 --> 40:13.306
maybe you could help us out, you know?

40:13.340 --> 40:15.008
Unless you're short on cash.

40:17.011 --> 40:19.012
Sure. Uh...

40:19.014 --> 40:20.513
Thank you.

40:20.515 --> 40:22.515
Uh...

40:22.517 --> 40:24.517
here's two.

40:24.602 --> 40:26.903
Gas is expensive.

40:26.937 --> 40:28.855
You know what, man?

40:28.906 --> 40:30.607
Why don't you hang on to that,

40:30.658 --> 40:32.492
and I'll just take that envelope?

40:34.195 --> 40:35.695
No!

40:35.697 --> 40:37.447
No!

40:49.877 --> 40:51.544
Get in the fucking car!

41:02.990 --> 41:04.891
Jesus! Stop!

41:04.893 --> 41:06.859
Aah! Aah!

41:06.894 --> 41:08.478
Please stop! Please!

41:14.468 --> 41:17.620
Oh, my God! Oh, my God!

42:41.905 --> 42:44.874
Are you OK? Huh?

42:44.908 --> 42:47.327
What'd they throw?

42:52.883 --> 42:55.385
Yes, uh, there has been an attack.

42:55.419 --> 42:57.904
A man was hit with a rock.
He's... he's bleeding.

42:57.938 --> 43:00.673
We're on, uh, Cedar Lane and...

43:02.226 --> 43:03.676
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

43:27.418 --> 43:29.085
Am I too late?

43:29.120 --> 43:31.538
Of course not. All are welcome.

45:00.455 --> 45:01.906
I'm sorry, Matthew,

45:01.908 --> 45:03.574
but it's spreading.

45:10.582 --> 45:13.250
Are they burning in there?

45:14.636 --> 45:16.587
Yes, Nora, they are.

45:16.638 --> 45:19.590
Why isn't anybody doing anything?

45:29.501 --> 45:32.436
Daddy! Daddy, where are you?!

45:32.487 --> 45:35.623
Help me!

45:37.943 --> 45:39.960
Sam!

45:39.995 --> 45:41.946
Sam!

45:41.997 --> 45:44.415
Sam!

45:50.005 --> 45:51.989
Hey!

45:57.045 --> 45:58.963
Honey?

45:59.014 --> 46:01.131
Do you hear me?

46:02.551 --> 46:04.018
Help!

46:04.052 --> 46:06.136
Please! I need help!

46:11.726 --> 46:13.143
Honey?

46:16.731 --> 46:18.983
Kevin! Where did you go?

46:22.320 --> 46:23.787
Help me!

46:23.822 --> 46:25.906
My wife is hurt!

46:25.957 --> 46:28.659
Please! Help!

46:58.106 --> 47:00.024
Matt, Matt.

47:00.075 --> 47:02.026
Why do you persist?

47:13.588 --> 47:17.341
Why isn't anybody
doing anything?

47:31.106 --> 47:32.856
Oh! My God!

47:41.149 --> 47:43.067
God.

47:59.584 --> 48:02.086
Hey, you shouldn't be up.

48:02.088 --> 48:04.638
- What time is it?
- You need to sit down.

48:04.673 --> 48:06.640
What time is it?

48:06.675 --> 48:08.475
4:30.

48:08.510 --> 48:11.310
Please, I need you to call the bank.

48:11.335 --> 48:14.035
FDR. The one on ***.

48:14.087 --> 48:16.054
Ask to speak to Jim Lewis.

48:16.089 --> 48:17.639
Tell him not to close.

48:17.674 --> 48:20.642
Tell him Matt Jamison
is coming over right now.

48:20.677 --> 48:22.094
Wait a minute. I don't know now. You...

48:22.145 --> 48:23.395
Just call him!

49:03.395 --> 49:05.346
No, no!

49:05.397 --> 49:07.348
- Someone called!
- We're sorry. We're closing.

49:07.399 --> 49:09.400
Wait! I need to see Jim Lewis.

49:09.434 --> 49:12.570
- We open tomorrow at 8:00.
- But wait! He's expecting me!

49:12.604 --> 49:13.738
- Hey!
- Step back!

49:15.107 --> 49:16.607
Jim! Jim! It's Matt!

49:16.609 --> 49:18.442
It's OK, Frank. Let him in.

49:22.080 --> 49:24.031
Jesus! Matt!

49:24.082 --> 49:25.499
What... what happened?

49:25.534 --> 49:28.085
I was, uh... I'm fine.

49:28.120 --> 49:30.037
I'm fine.

49:30.088 --> 49:31.505
Here it is.

49:31.540 --> 49:34.291
All of it, in cash.

49:35.844 --> 49:37.795
Well, I...

49:37.829 --> 49:40.297
I'm sorry, Matt. It's...

49:40.349 --> 49:41.799
it's too late.

49:44.353 --> 49:45.803
No.

49:45.854 --> 49:48.305
No, it... you said

49:48.307 --> 49:51.308
end of day, and it's only...10 minutes.

49:51.360 --> 49:53.811
I... I have the money.

49:53.862 --> 49:56.030
We made a deal.

49:56.064 --> 49:59.483
That was 3 days ago.

50:00.869 --> 50:02.820
What?

50:02.822 --> 50:05.823
You came in on Monday.

50:05.874 --> 50:09.326
This is... Thursday.

50:09.328 --> 50:12.997
Now, I tried calling you
on your cell phone, but...

50:14.833 --> 50:18.836
I'm, uh, I... I'm sorry, Matt.

50:18.838 --> 50:22.476
No one here wanted them to have it.

50:22.527 --> 50:25.362
But they paid all cash, no escrow.

50:26.781 --> 50:28.699
They, uh,

50:28.733 --> 50:31.201
they took possession yesterday.

50:33.788 --> 50:35.872
"They"?
