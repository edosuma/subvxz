00:02.635 --> 00:04.330
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.504 --> 00:06.836
For over a century,
I've lived in secret. Until now.

00:07.006 --> 00:10.601
- I know the risk. But I have to know her.
- Elena, a dead ringer for Katherine.

00:10.776 --> 00:13.370
You have no idea of the future
I have planned for us.

00:13.546 --> 00:15.173
You, me and Damon.

00:15.348 --> 00:17.782
Our love for Katherine
wasn't real, Damon.

00:17.950 --> 00:20.851
Katherine never compelled me.
I knew everything.

00:21.020 --> 00:23.250
I'm gonna bring her back.
Tell me how to get in the tomb.

00:23.422 --> 00:24.912
- The grimoire.
- Where is it?

00:25.091 --> 00:26.752
The journal. Johnathan Gilbert's.

00:26.926 --> 00:29.554
- Your ancestor's journal?
- I gave it to my teacher.

00:29.729 --> 00:30.889
- Alaric Saltzman.
- Damon.

00:31.097 --> 00:34.396
The grimoire, it was Emily's?
You need it to reverse the spell?

00:34.567 --> 00:35.591
- I'll help you.
- Okay.

00:35.768 --> 00:38.430
I told Damon
that I'd help him get Katherine back.

00:38.604 --> 00:40.629
- But it was a lie. I can't let him.
- Don't.

00:40.806 --> 00:42.535
I'll help you. Whatever it takes.

00:44.000 --> 00:50.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

00:57.757 --> 01:00.817
Please! Please help us.

01:02.461 --> 01:05.453
Please. My husband. He's been hurt.
Please help him.

01:07.934 --> 01:09.834
What are you two doing out here?

01:10.002 --> 01:11.970
- It's not safe.
- No.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.162
No, sir.

01:13.339 --> 01:15.466
It's not safe.

01:33.893 --> 01:35.793
And that's how it's done.

01:39.765 --> 01:41.062
What happens to the bodies?

01:41.233 --> 01:45.363
We'll take them into the woods.
The other animals will finish them off.

01:49.342 --> 01:51.173
Are you sure you're ready for this?

01:54.847 --> 01:57.281
I'm ready. I want you to turn me.

01:57.450 --> 01:58.508
When it's time.

02:00.920 --> 02:01.978
Kiss me.

02:04.724 --> 02:07.056
You should get a taste.

02:10.162 --> 02:11.527
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be.

02:12.098 --> 02:13.895
Soon you won't be able to get enough.

02:41.727 --> 02:44.093
Mm. Good morning.

02:45.364 --> 02:47.696
I could get used to this.

02:49.068 --> 02:50.626
Rise and shine, sleepy heads.

02:50.836 --> 02:52.394
- Please.
- What are you doing?

02:52.571 --> 02:53.765
Oh, stop being smutty.

02:53.939 --> 02:55.031
Get out of here.

02:55.207 --> 02:58.574
If I see something I haven't seen before,
I'll throw a dollar at it. Listen.

02:58.744 --> 03:00.837
There's very important business
to discuss.

03:01.013 --> 03:02.844
- It has to be now?
- We have lots to do.

03:03.382 --> 03:07.079
Now that we're all friends
and working toward a common goal.

03:08.154 --> 03:11.612
So in order to open the tomb,
we need to find the journal...

03:11.791 --> 03:14.055
...to get the grimoire to undo the spells.

03:14.226 --> 03:17.127
Since you are Elena Gilbert,
you're on journal duty.

03:17.296 --> 03:19.423
- Since when am I helping?
- Stefan's helping.

03:19.598 --> 03:22.726
And you've taken up residency
in Stefan's bed. Ergo...

03:22.902 --> 03:24.995
Don't do anything you don't wanna do.

03:25.171 --> 03:26.900
- I'll look for it today.
- Good.

03:27.073 --> 03:30.804
How do we know that this journal
will hold the location of the grimoire?

03:30.976 --> 03:34.104
We're gonna take the word of this vampire?
Seemed like a dimwit.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.248
- In lieu of any other options.
- Okay.

03:36.415 --> 03:38.280
What exactly is a grimoire anyway?

03:38.451 --> 03:40.510
It's a witch's cookbook.

03:40.986 --> 03:45.685
Every spell a witch casts is unique.
Every witch would document their work.

03:45.891 --> 03:48.758
- Yeah. Cookbook.
- What about our mystery vampire?

03:49.595 --> 03:52.029
Dimwit, obviously,
wasn't working alone...

03:52.198 --> 03:54.666
...so whoever is out there
knows who we are.

03:54.834 --> 03:58.167
And I don't like that disadvantage.
So... chop-chop.

03:59.438 --> 04:03.101
You know, I really like this whole
menage-a-threesome team thing.

04:03.275 --> 04:05.766
It's got a bit of a kink to it. Ha, ha.

04:05.945 --> 04:07.469
Don't screw it up.

04:10.683 --> 04:12.651
He doesn't...?

04:13.285 --> 04:15.480
Oh, right. Yeah.

04:16.856 --> 04:18.187
- Okay.
-  Oh.

04:18.357 --> 04:20.052
No. Come here.

04:22.828 --> 04:24.318
- We shouldn't...
- Shh.

04:35.374 --> 04:39.003
- What are you doing? Stop it.
- Make me.

04:53.159 --> 04:54.854
Yes?

04:57.830 --> 04:59.661
Excuse me, Miss Katherine.

04:59.832 --> 05:02.266
Miss Pearl is here to see you.

05:02.701 --> 05:05.033
I'll be down soon. Please ask her to wait.

05:07.173 --> 05:08.470
Thank you, Emily.

05:10.576 --> 05:13.511
- Mm. Fun's over.
- Mm, no.

05:19.752 --> 05:21.481
Good to see you, Pearl.

05:22.087 --> 05:23.782
Perhaps we could talk outside.

05:25.424 --> 05:26.482
Emily...

05:26.792 --> 05:30.353
...would you please tell Mr. Salvatore
that I've stepped away?

05:30.696 --> 05:31.720
Which one?

05:33.699 --> 05:34.723
Both.

05:39.438 --> 05:42.430
How long do you plan on staying
with the Salvatores?

05:42.608 --> 05:44.439
People talk, Katherine.

05:44.610 --> 05:48.808
You carrying on with both brothers
doesn't help the situation.

05:49.014 --> 05:51.312
The Salvatores have been kind
to take me in.

05:51.517 --> 05:53.246
As far as everyone here knows...

05:53.419 --> 05:57.321
...l'm a poor orphan girl from Atlanta
who lost her family in the fires, heh.

05:57.523 --> 05:58.854
A match you lit, no doubt.

06:00.926 --> 06:03.019
Honey, please be careful.

06:07.099 --> 06:10.125
Honoria Fell came by
the apothecary yesterday...

06:10.302 --> 06:12.634
...with a case of this elixir.

06:12.805 --> 06:15.330
She asked that it be sold
at a reduced rate.

06:15.541 --> 06:17.133
- I don't follow.
- Try it.

06:22.848 --> 06:24.042
What in hell...?

06:24.216 --> 06:26.616
- Vervain.
- Why is there ver?

06:28.053 --> 06:29.179
They know.

06:29.355 --> 06:31.755
They're trying to find us.
They're getting crafty.

06:31.924 --> 06:35.792
Townspeople ingesting vervain.
Well, that's inconvenient.

06:36.128 --> 06:38.062
It might be time for us to move again.

06:38.230 --> 06:42.223
No. I like it here.
I'm not interested in leaving just yet.

06:42.701 --> 06:43.759
Can we go, Mama?

06:47.373 --> 06:48.863
Is something wrong?

06:50.142 --> 06:53.339
Hey. It's me again. Anna.

06:53.512 --> 06:55.673
Stalker chick and foosball champion.

06:55.848 --> 06:58.180
Um, I'll be at the Grill later.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.682
If you want,
you know, a rematch or whatever.

07:02.621 --> 07:04.145
Who are you calling?

07:04.323 --> 07:05.517
Jeremy Gilbert.

07:07.192 --> 07:09.387
You're not, like, into him, are you?

07:09.795 --> 07:11.854
I need him for something.
Get over it.

07:14.033 --> 07:16.524
- Damn it.
- Dude, you gotta stop doing that.

07:16.702 --> 07:19.102
I know. I just... I keep forgetting.

07:19.672 --> 07:22.470
You're new. You'll get it.

07:22.641 --> 07:24.233
You found the Gilbert journal?

07:24.410 --> 07:27.106
That look like the Gilbert journal?

07:27.313 --> 07:29.042
Well, it's old and musty and...

07:29.214 --> 07:31.341
How am I supposed to know
the difference?

07:31.517 --> 07:32.984
I figured maybe, just maybe...

07:33.152 --> 07:35.552
...you've been paying
a little bit of attention since we met.

07:36.922 --> 07:39.891
You know, you don't have
to talk down to me. I'm not stupid.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.128
Here. Drink.

07:45.564 --> 07:49.364
I don't want you itchy around the witch.
She can sense if you're weak.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.030
Mm.

07:51.937 --> 07:55.532
When can we go hunting again?
This tastes old. I want fresh blood.

07:55.941 --> 07:58.774
When we get that tomb open,
you can kill anyone you want.

08:00.346 --> 08:02.177
For now, just stay focused on Bonnie...

08:02.348 --> 08:05.283
...while I try to get the journal back
from Jeremy's teacher.

08:05.918 --> 08:07.283
Why did you choose me?

08:08.053 --> 08:10.715
I needed someone in a position
to be my eyes and ears.

08:10.889 --> 08:12.550
Small-town bartender fit the bill.

08:12.725 --> 08:15.558
But there are plenty of bartenders
to choose from.

08:15.728 --> 08:16.752
Why me?

08:17.563 --> 08:19.053
You were sad, Ben.

08:19.231 --> 08:21.791
You lacked purpose. You needed me.

08:25.704 --> 08:29.401
Do you think Damon really believes us?
That we're both trying to help him?

08:31.477 --> 08:35.038
I don't think Damon knows
what to believe. Trust isn't something...

08:35.313 --> 08:36.871
...that comes naturally to him.

08:38.250 --> 08:41.378
You know, I really think
that Damon believes...

08:41.553 --> 08:44.613
...that everything he's done,
every move, he's done for love.

08:45.257 --> 08:48.192
It's twisted but kind of sad.

08:50.729 --> 08:53.892
There are other ways
to get what you want.

08:54.066 --> 08:55.727
You don't have to kill people.

08:56.235 --> 08:59.102
Damon has no regard for human life.

08:59.271 --> 09:01.432
He enjoys inflicting pain on others.

09:03.742 --> 09:08.202
For 145 years, every single time...

09:08.380 --> 09:13.079
...that I have let my guard down
and let Damon back into my life...

09:13.252 --> 09:15.846
...he's done something
to make me regret that.

09:16.021 --> 09:19.320
- I'm not gonna make that mistake again.
- What will happen...

09:19.491 --> 09:22.927
...if the tomb gets opened
and Damon gets Katherine back?

09:24.329 --> 09:27.662
I think no matter what Damon promises,
a lot of people will die.

09:36.975 --> 09:39.239
That's Johnathan Gilbert.

09:43.482 --> 09:44.642
What's this?

09:49.388 --> 09:51.117
What are you guys doing?

09:51.290 --> 09:55.454
Hey. Just, um, going through some stuff.
Feeling sentimental.

09:55.627 --> 09:58.061
Dad had this old journal.
I thought I'd dig it up.

09:58.263 --> 09:59.696
Johnathan Gilbert's journal?

10:00.332 --> 10:03.199
- Yeah. What do you know about it?
- I just did a history report on it.

10:03.368 --> 10:06.303
- Oh. Where is it now?
- Gave it to Mr. Saltzman.

10:06.472 --> 10:07.769
He wanted to see it.

10:10.776 --> 10:13.711
I met Barnette and Guiseppe this evening.

10:14.646 --> 10:17.843
I saw the skepticism in their eyes
when I showed them the compass.

10:18.016 --> 10:20.507
We're supposed to believe
that can track one of them?

10:21.286 --> 10:22.981
- What is it Magic?
- It's science.

10:23.155 --> 10:27.558
- I'll believe it when I see it.
- This church idea, I believe it could work.

10:29.528 --> 10:31.860
Excuse me, Father,
I didn't know you had guests.

10:32.030 --> 10:36.558
- We'll be done in a few minutes.
- Forgive me, Mr. Gilbert, Mr. Lockwood.

10:38.704 --> 10:41.332
- Have you told them?
- Not yet.

10:41.507 --> 10:43.236
We need all the men we can get.

10:43.408 --> 10:47.105
I'll tell them.
You can count on both my boys.

11:49.575 --> 11:51.270
Hello?

12:00.385 --> 12:02.114
Hello?

12:07.526 --> 12:09.426
Someone there?

12:51.570 --> 12:53.936
- Unh.
- You shouldn't have done that.

12:58.210 --> 12:59.268
Have a seat.

13:05.017 --> 13:06.507
What is this, compressed air?

13:07.986 --> 13:09.851
Did you make it yourself?

13:10.789 --> 13:11.915
Who are you?

13:13.625 --> 13:15.855
I'm not gonna hurt you...

13:16.028 --> 13:17.689
...unless you try that again.

13:26.471 --> 13:27.529
Now...

13:30.575 --> 13:32.042
...who are you?

13:32.878 --> 13:33.970
I'm a teacher.

13:37.449 --> 13:39.747
We're gonna have to do this
the hard way?

13:39.985 --> 13:41.816
I'm also a historian.

13:42.688 --> 13:48.092
And while researching Virginia, I made
a few discoveries about your town.

13:48.260 --> 13:49.818
So you show up like Van Helsing.

13:50.228 --> 13:53.061
Come on. Tell me the truth.

13:54.433 --> 13:57.368
My wife was a parapsychologist.

13:57.536 --> 14:01.370
She spent her life researching
paranormal activity in this area.

14:01.540 --> 14:03.872
- Her work led me here.
- Where is your wife?

14:04.242 --> 14:05.709
Dead.

14:06.111 --> 14:07.908
A vampire killed her.

14:08.847 --> 14:11.008
- Where's the Gilbert journal?
- What do you want with it?

14:11.183 --> 14:12.878
- Where is it?
- It's on my desk.

14:13.218 --> 14:14.242
No, it's not.

14:18.423 --> 14:20.414
It was on my desk.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.760
- Anything?
- Not yet. Just a lot of gibberish.

14:28.200 --> 14:30.464
You know,
some people shouldn't journal.

14:30.635 --> 14:33.195
I thought this Gilbert was the brains.

14:34.740 --> 14:36.435
Don't you have a date?

14:36.608 --> 14:38.132
Yup. Wish me luck.

14:42.814 --> 14:44.247
I saw her again today.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.281
The most beautiful woman in town...

14:46.618 --> 14:49.451
...with a name just as pretty. Pearl.

14:49.621 --> 14:51.054
Thought about what I've said?

14:51.223 --> 14:55.159
We'll leave soon, Pearl, I promise.
I need to take care of a few things first.

14:56.661 --> 14:59.391
You're gonna turn both of them,
aren't you?

15:00.732 --> 15:03.496
Katherine, please be careful.

15:03.668 --> 15:06.728
We'll all be safe. I promise.

15:06.905 --> 15:09.567
Mr. Gilbert's coming. Quick. Your cheeks.

15:10.642 --> 15:12.041
Perfectly rosy.

15:12.544 --> 15:13.841
Miss Pearl?

15:14.279 --> 15:15.974
May I have a moment?

15:16.148 --> 15:17.979
Yes, Mr. Gilbert.

15:18.650 --> 15:23.485
I'm still waiting for you
to explain that comet in the sky.

15:26.792 --> 15:28.555
Your mother has an admirer.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.920
As descendants
of the founding families...

15:33.098 --> 15:37.592
...they wanna know they can count on you.
- Of course they can. Is there any doubt?

15:38.270 --> 15:41.637
I'm not sure
your brother Damon understands...

15:41.807 --> 15:43.206
...the importance of duty.

15:43.375 --> 15:46.344
Damon left the Confederacy on principle.

15:46.511 --> 15:49.344
And it's his choice
and should be respected.

15:49.514 --> 15:53.280
- I have trouble respecting a deserter.
- I never asked for your respect.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.147
Good for you, Damon.

15:55.320 --> 15:57.151
Because all I have is disappointment.

16:01.293 --> 16:03.158
You said the town is in trouble?

16:05.363 --> 16:07.695
There have been too many deaths.

16:07.866 --> 16:10.334
It's time for us to fight back.
Stop these killers.

16:10.502 --> 16:13.369
- What are you talking about?
- We live amongst demons.

16:13.538 --> 16:15.597
You're being cryptic now, Father.

16:15.774 --> 16:17.799
Why don't you just say the word?

16:18.043 --> 16:19.476
Vampires.

16:20.412 --> 16:22.039
They exist.

16:22.614 --> 16:26.015
And they live amongst us.
But we have a plan to kill them.

16:28.119 --> 16:29.552
And you're going to help us.

16:33.992 --> 16:36.051
My father never approved of anyone I dated.

16:36.895 --> 16:40.991
Which only made me want them more,
of course.

16:41.666 --> 16:44.499
- What about you?
- There were a few guys.

16:44.669 --> 16:46.500
Logan isn't the only loser I've dated.

16:46.771 --> 16:48.864
They ever find him? Is he still missing?

16:49.374 --> 16:50.568
He's not missing.

16:50.876 --> 16:54.835
He's in the Bahamas working on his tan.
Very entitled, that one.

16:55.013 --> 16:57.072
Marches to his own drum.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.573
He's a Fell.

16:59.751 --> 17:00.775
They're all snooty.

17:07.425 --> 17:09.188
Hello, Elena.

17:11.061 --> 17:12.926
Hey. Where have you been?

17:13.231 --> 17:14.664
We're cooking dinner.

17:14.833 --> 17:17.893
- Stefan with you?
- Um, he'll be here soon.

17:19.704 --> 17:21.762
How long have you been aware of me?

17:23.407 --> 17:26.707
I learned just recently.
When I met your brother.

17:27.479 --> 17:28.537
You met Damon.

17:29.447 --> 17:31.244
Who do you think killed my wife?

17:33.084 --> 17:36.110
- You certain it was Damon?
- I witnessed it.

17:37.122 --> 17:40.057
If you're here for revenge...

17:40.225 --> 17:42.386
...this is gonna end very badly for you.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.722
I wanna find out
what happened to my wife.

17:44.896 --> 17:47.421
- I thought you just said that Damon...
- Ah.

17:48.934 --> 17:51.903
I saw him draining the life out of her.

17:54.639 --> 17:59.235
He must have heard me coming.
He just disappeared.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.436
So did her body.

18:01.846 --> 18:03.279
They never found her.

18:09.487 --> 18:11.284
Damon can never know why you're here.

18:12.791 --> 18:14.952
He'll kill you without blinking.

18:15.360 --> 18:16.657
I can take care of myself.

18:18.029 --> 18:19.758
No, you can't.

18:19.931 --> 18:21.489
I can help you.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.995
If you let me.

18:29.941 --> 18:31.806
Oh. Mm.

18:33.345 --> 18:36.280
- Don't do that.
- Do what?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.040
You know. That was deliberate.

18:38.249 --> 18:41.275
Well, yeah. I was deliberately trying
to get to the sink.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.652
Speaking of Stefan, where is he?

18:45.390 --> 18:48.655
He's missing family night,
which I am enjoying immensely.

18:53.665 --> 18:55.462
- Is it real?
- Is what real?

18:55.634 --> 18:59.297
This renewed sense of brotherhood.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.274
Can I trust him?

19:04.342 --> 19:06.469
Yes, you can trust him.

19:13.418 --> 19:15.386
Can I trust him?

19:16.054 --> 19:18.579
I'm wearing vervain, Damon.
It's not gonna work.

19:20.225 --> 19:21.556
I'm not compelling you.

19:23.194 --> 19:25.321
I just want you to answer me.

19:27.065 --> 19:28.293
Honestly.

19:31.836 --> 19:32.894
Of course you can.

19:38.176 --> 19:41.202
You can trust me,
Mr. Salvatore. I would never cheat.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.549
I'm losing over here. Again.

19:51.056 --> 19:54.753
She's good. I almost believe
she genuinely likes him.

19:56.127 --> 19:57.890
- Perhaps she does.
- Ha, ha.

19:58.063 --> 20:01.123
She knows Father would have her killed
if he knew the truth.

20:02.967 --> 20:07.028
Not if we talked to him. Explained how
we feel. He could help us keep her safe.

20:07.205 --> 20:08.263
Are you going mad?

20:08.840 --> 20:11.138
No. Father would
drive a stake in her himself.

20:11.342 --> 20:13.708
- Not true. We can trust him.
- Not with this.

20:13.878 --> 20:16.574
No, please...
Promise me you won't tell him, Stefan.

20:25.890 --> 20:27.448
I promise.

20:31.162 --> 20:33.824
There was a time
that I trusted him more than anyone.

20:33.998 --> 20:37.092
Trust breeds trust.
You have to give it to get it.

20:37.969 --> 20:39.095
Are you lecturing me?

20:40.371 --> 20:42.566
Do you need to be lectured?

20:43.108 --> 20:46.168
I just want her back.
I'm sure you can understand that.

20:47.812 --> 20:52.875
I can understand
that you would do anything for her, yes.

20:53.618 --> 20:58.783
Then you understand what I will do
if anyone gets in my way.

21:08.899 --> 21:11.231
You said
you had never played this thing before.

21:11.401 --> 21:14.302
I'm a fast learner. Quick reflexes.

21:21.144 --> 21:25.945
- Who are you dodging?
- This girl Anna. She can be, uh, persistent.

21:26.917 --> 21:30.853
- Is she hot?
- Yeah. Yeah. But she can be weird.

21:31.054 --> 21:33.716
Pfft. Hot trumps weird. Trust me.

21:35.091 --> 21:37.559
-  He is ridiculously hot.
- Shh.

21:39.796 --> 21:40.854
He's an ass.

21:42.933 --> 21:44.764
What are you doing with this?

21:44.935 --> 21:49.269
I thought there might be something
about my birth parents.

21:50.273 --> 21:52.138
Have you told Jeremy?

21:52.309 --> 21:54.334
I will. When the time is right.

21:55.712 --> 21:57.680
That's Stefan.

21:58.381 --> 21:59.939
Dude.

22:06.122 --> 22:07.350
Well?

22:08.892 --> 22:12.760
- Admit it. I can't sing.
- No. You were great.

22:12.929 --> 22:15.523
Come on.
I totally, like, trashed the Metallica song.

22:15.699 --> 22:19.294
Well, first mistake. Metallica karaoke?

22:19.469 --> 22:22.700
- At least I committed.
- That woman with the tattoos loved you.

22:23.340 --> 22:25.808
Well, next time,
I'm gonna throw out my Pearl Jam.

22:26.476 --> 22:27.773
Next time?

22:28.278 --> 22:29.404
Yeah.

22:30.814 --> 22:33.510
So, what are your friends up to tonight?

22:33.683 --> 22:36.151
Doing their own thing.
Caroline's at her dad's.

22:36.319 --> 22:38.549
- Elena's with her boyfriend.
- Elena Gilbert?

22:38.722 --> 22:41.350
- Yeah.
- I remember you guys used to hang out.

22:41.524 --> 22:42.923
Yeah. She's my best friend.

22:43.893 --> 22:46.418
My friends,
they all moved away after graduation...

22:46.596 --> 22:49.895
...and I didn't,
so we just kind of drifted apart.

22:50.066 --> 22:53.331
Yeah. Elena and I are bonded for life.
Ha, ha.

22:53.503 --> 22:55.528
- I can't imagine it any other way.
- Huh.

22:56.406 --> 23:00.001
- That tight, huh?
- She's my sister. I mean, I'd die for her.

23:01.311 --> 23:02.437
Huh.

23:03.847 --> 23:05.337
- Who took it?
- I don't know.

23:05.515 --> 23:07.949
It's that teacher.
There's something off about him.

23:08.118 --> 23:10.211
No. Somebody got to it right before me.

23:10.387 --> 23:12.184
Who else knew it was there?

23:15.825 --> 23:17.452
No. Damon, leave him out of it.

23:17.627 --> 23:19.720
- Why What's the big deal?
- Damon.

23:19.896 --> 23:25.630
So I heard you found a really cool journal
from back in the day.

23:25.835 --> 23:27.302
- Who else did you show it to?
- Huh?

23:27.470 --> 23:30.735
- Don't ask questions. Just spill.
- You're kidding me, right?

23:30.907 --> 23:33.205
Did you tell anyone
other than Mr. Saltzman...

23:33.376 --> 23:34.707
...about Gilbert's journal?

23:35.211 --> 23:38.840
- Why is everybody obsessed with that?
- Who else did you tell?

23:39.015 --> 23:40.949
- Mm, just Anna.
- The hot, weird one?

23:41.117 --> 23:42.550
- Yeah.
- Wait. Who is Anna?

23:42.719 --> 23:44.550
That's what I wanna find out.

23:45.922 --> 23:47.253
How do you know her?

23:47.424 --> 23:48.789
I just know her.

23:48.958 --> 23:51.927
- She wants to meet at the Grill tonight.
- Perfect.

23:52.762 --> 23:55.424
- I'll drive. Come on.
- Oh. Okay.

23:56.399 --> 23:57.798
Okay. I'm alone.

23:57.967 --> 24:00.367
Give me all the deets, Bonnie. I'm dying.

24:00.537 --> 24:03.301
It's going great.
He's a perfect gentleman.

24:03.506 --> 24:05.098
- A gentleman?
- I know.

24:05.275 --> 24:07.800
Boring, huh? I just wanna grab him
and lay one on him.

24:07.977 --> 24:10.138
- So why don't you?
- Because I'm a chicken.

24:10.346 --> 24:12.610
Heh, you're a powerful witch-goddess.
Come on.

24:12.782 --> 24:14.249
Seize the day, Broom Hilda.

24:14.417 --> 24:17.443
Ha, ha. Okay. I'm gonna text you later
with more details.

24:17.620 --> 24:19.110
You better.

24:21.424 --> 24:24.188
- Where's Damon?
- He left to track down Jeremy's friend.

24:24.394 --> 24:26.988
- See if there was anything there.
- Aren't you gonna go?

24:27.163 --> 24:29.961
- Lf he gets to the journal before we do...
- Doesn't matter.

24:30.133 --> 24:32.761
- What is that?
- It's a copy of it.

24:33.470 --> 24:34.664
How did you get it?

24:34.838 --> 24:38.899
Well, Mr. Saltzman made a copy
and was kind enough to loan it to me.

24:39.542 --> 24:43.205
- He did?
- Not exactly. But I got it.

24:47.650 --> 24:49.641
You just couldn't live without me, huh?

24:49.819 --> 24:53.186
Well, I kind of missed my daily dose
of cute stalker chick.

24:53.356 --> 24:56.291
- Funny, ha, ha.
- Let's play.

25:08.204 --> 25:09.796
The sheriff was here earlier.

25:10.206 --> 25:13.300
He bought large volumes
of the vervain elixir.

25:13.476 --> 25:16.138
- Did he try to put his hands on you?
- Doesn't he always?

25:16.312 --> 25:18.371
She's saving herself
for Johnathan Gilbert.

25:18.548 --> 25:22.109
- I am beyond saving. We know that.
- Ha, ha.

25:22.285 --> 25:23.650
How can you be so calm?

25:24.787 --> 25:28.951
- They're getting closer to you every day.
- We're respectable ladies of Mystic Falls.

25:29.125 --> 25:31.184
Thanks to Emily,
we walk the streets in daylight.

25:31.628 --> 25:32.993
No one will ever suspect us.

25:33.163 --> 25:35.563
Not unless a human tells them.

25:36.232 --> 25:37.529
I'd sooner die.

25:38.067 --> 25:40.831
And soon enough, you will.

25:43.506 --> 25:45.838
Mrs. Fell is approaching.

25:49.712 --> 25:50.872
Thank you, Annabelle.

26:06.362 --> 26:08.956
Here's a reference
that he wrote about Emily.

26:09.132 --> 26:11.896
"The Fell family believed it should be I,
not them...

26:12.068 --> 26:14.002
...who protected the witch's spell book.

26:14.170 --> 26:16.798
But I feared she would haunt me
from the hereafter.

26:16.973 --> 26:20.602
They mocked my fear,
but it was Guiseppe Salvatore who..."

26:21.744 --> 26:23.302
Is that your father?

26:23.813 --> 26:25.303
Yeah.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.080
"It was Guiseppe Salvatore
who removed my fear.

26:31.254 --> 26:34.314
He told me he would protect
the secret of the spell book.

26:34.490 --> 26:38.392
He said he would carry it to his grave."

26:44.467 --> 26:46.025
Oh, Stefan.

26:46.603 --> 26:48.093
To what do I owe this pleasure?

26:48.771 --> 26:53.265
- Did I interrupt your writing?
- Dull musings of my troubled mind.

26:53.643 --> 26:54.701
A great mind.

26:55.278 --> 26:58.975
- I will carry the real secrets with me...
- To your grave.

26:59.415 --> 27:00.939
And a full grave it will be.

27:11.494 --> 27:15.055
Now, speaking of troubled minds,
what's on yours?

27:17.333 --> 27:21.133
I have concerns
about your plan for the vampires.

27:22.972 --> 27:26.305
- And why is that?
- We are making the assumption...

27:26.476 --> 27:29.843
...that all vampires are as evil
as they have been characterized.

27:30.013 --> 27:34.575
- But what if that's not true?
- You have any evidence to the contrary?

27:34.951 --> 27:39.047
- Do you know of any vampires?
- No. No, of course not.

27:39.355 --> 27:43.052
But are we to take what others say
at face value?

27:43.226 --> 27:44.955
You always taught us so differently.

27:47.664 --> 27:52.761
Stefan, these creatures
are of the darkest parts of hell.

27:52.969 --> 27:55.096
They have the ability
to control your mind...

27:55.538 --> 27:57.403
...seduce your spirit.

27:57.573 --> 28:01.532
They are deadly,
and they must be destroyed.

28:02.412 --> 28:04.346
Those who stand with them...

28:04.514 --> 28:08.075
...who bring shame to their families,
will be destroyed as well.

28:17.860 --> 28:18.986
I know where it is.

28:33.042 --> 28:35.169
Okay, I give. Okay.

28:38.748 --> 28:40.238
Damn.

28:40.550 --> 28:42.415
You're strong for a little thing.

28:42.952 --> 28:45.716
I was wondering
how long it would take you to find me.

28:47.323 --> 28:50.292
Why isn't your father buried
in your family's tomb?

28:50.460 --> 28:52.587
It wasn't built until well after he died.

28:52.762 --> 28:55.390
Are you sure
the grimoire is in there with him?

28:55.565 --> 28:57.795
Sure as I can be.

28:58.334 --> 28:59.824
Great.

29:01.270 --> 29:03.067
Elena...

29:03.239 --> 29:06.640
...I can do this on my own.
- I said I would do whatever I can to help.

29:06.809 --> 29:10.677
- I know, and I appreciate that, but...
- This town is my home, Stefan.

29:10.847 --> 29:13.645
My friends and family are here.
You're here.

29:13.816 --> 29:16.944
I don't want that tomb opened
any more than you do.

29:36.672 --> 29:38.606
I'm sorry that you have to do this.

29:40.443 --> 29:41.967
What is that?

29:42.145 --> 29:43.544
A gift.

29:43.713 --> 29:45.442
From Damon?

29:45.615 --> 29:47.879
From Emily, actually.

29:48.084 --> 29:51.349
And when will you stop worrying
about Damon?

29:51.521 --> 29:52.749
I want you all to myself.

29:52.922 --> 29:54.947
Ha, ha. Just as he wants me.

29:55.124 --> 29:57.854
But I'm the one
who gets to make all the rules.

29:58.027 --> 30:00.552
- And why is that?
- Because I'm spoiled.

30:00.730 --> 30:03.597
- Yes, you are.
- And selfish.

30:03.766 --> 30:05.028
Mm-hm.

30:29.625 --> 30:31.115
What?

30:32.228 --> 30:33.252
Vervain.

30:34.330 --> 30:35.388
What?

30:39.902 --> 30:42.666
Katherine. Katherine.

30:44.340 --> 30:46.740
Go get the sheriff.
Tell him we have a vampire.

30:46.909 --> 30:49.275
- What? No.
- Do as I say, son.

30:49.645 --> 30:51.738
Nothing that you feel for her is real.

30:52.181 --> 30:54.411
She's a vampire, Stefan. A monster.

30:54.584 --> 30:57.144
I fed you vervain,
hoping that it would expose her.

30:57.320 --> 30:59.880
- How did you know?
- Your sympathy for their plight.

31:00.656 --> 31:03.682
I didn't raise my sons to be so weak.
The sheriff.

31:03.860 --> 31:05.953
Now. Go! Quickly!

31:07.663 --> 31:09.290
Now, son.

31:24.146 --> 31:26.114
How long have you been here?

31:26.349 --> 31:28.317
I arrived around half past comet.

31:28.484 --> 31:31.920
Watching you screw up
every chance you had to open that tomb.

31:32.522 --> 31:34.285
How did you know about the spell?

31:34.457 --> 31:36.152
I didn't say much back then.

31:36.325 --> 31:38.156
Which means I heard everything.

31:38.661 --> 31:41.892
If you've been here the whole time,
why are we crossing paths now?

31:42.064 --> 31:44.123
I like to use others to do my dirty work.

31:46.702 --> 31:47.999
Like Logan Fell?

31:48.638 --> 31:50.833
Oh, yeah. Thanks for that, by the way.

31:51.007 --> 31:52.031
Little bastard shot me.

31:52.208 --> 31:54.836
- Heh. Logan was an idiot.
- Mm-hm.

31:55.011 --> 31:58.071
Slipped him blood when he started
getting slayer with that compass.

31:58.247 --> 32:02.013
- I needed his journal. I couldn't let him die.
- What did you want with the Fell journal?

32:02.184 --> 32:05.551
I thought it contained the location
of the witch's spell book.

32:05.721 --> 32:07.018
I was wrong.

32:07.189 --> 32:10.920
According to her journal, Honoria gave
the grimoire to Johnathan Gilbert.

32:11.093 --> 32:13.653
And according to this...

32:16.499 --> 32:19.559
...he gave it to your father.
Now you're gonna help me find it.

32:20.770 --> 32:21.828
Why would I help you?

32:22.004 --> 32:24.268
Because you and I
both want that tomb open.

32:36.085 --> 32:37.518
Hmm. Heh.

32:40.756 --> 32:44.123
Sorry. I work alone.

32:46.696 --> 32:49.256
Well, the check's paid.
I'm all yours tonight.

32:49.432 --> 32:52.196
What do you wanna do?

32:56.005 --> 32:58.769
- What's wrong?
- Nothing. Sorry.

32:59.375 --> 33:02.105
I should've waited
till the end of the night to do that.

33:02.278 --> 33:03.302
I didn't mind.

33:05.014 --> 33:07.244
- I'm starting to get tired.
- You wanna go?

33:07.416 --> 33:11.648
I was gonna say have some more coffee,
get a caffeine buzz and... I don't know.

33:11.821 --> 33:14.483
- Go out and do something crazy.
- Hmm, like what?

33:14.657 --> 33:16.056
Like anything.

33:17.259 --> 33:19.420
- Okay.
- I'm gonna run to the restroom.

33:19.595 --> 33:21.290
- Okay.
- All right.

33:44.353 --> 33:45.843
What?

33:46.055 --> 33:48.250
Not many girls can say they've done this.

34:16.452 --> 34:17.679
Is that it?

34:56.391 --> 34:57.620
Well, what do you know?

35:01.764 --> 35:03.891
This is an interesting turn of events.

35:07.069 --> 35:09.264
I can't let you bring her back.

35:09.438 --> 35:11.929
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

35:13.375 --> 35:15.707
For thinking for even a second
I could trust you.

35:17.079 --> 35:21.675
You are not capable of trust. The fact
you're here means you read the journal.

35:21.851 --> 35:23.944
You were planning
on doing this yourself.

35:24.153 --> 35:27.953
Of course. Because the only one
I can count on is me.

35:29.658 --> 35:32.388
You made sure of that
many years ago, Stefan.

35:35.397 --> 35:36.887
But you...

35:40.770 --> 35:42.294
You had me fooled.

35:52.181 --> 35:54.115
So, what are you gonna do now?

35:54.750 --> 35:57.241
Try and destroy that, I'll rip her heart out.

35:57.419 --> 35:58.750
You won't kill her.

36:03.759 --> 36:05.920
I can do one better.

36:09.565 --> 36:11.055
Give me the book, Stefan.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.192
Or I'm snapping her neck...

36:13.369 --> 36:15.997
...and you and I will have
a vampire girlfriend.

36:16.205 --> 36:17.604
Let her go first.

36:19.475 --> 36:20.499
The book.

36:20.709 --> 36:24.270
I'm not gonna give this to you
until she is standing next to me.

36:24.446 --> 36:26.505
I no longer trust that you'll give it back.

36:26.682 --> 36:29.583
You just did the one thing
that ensures that I will.

36:33.355 --> 36:34.515
Okay.

37:10.993 --> 37:13.325
Now, make sure
the two of you stick together.

37:14.263 --> 37:16.390
- Check those woods over there!
- They're here.

37:16.565 --> 37:19.500
- God's on our side.
- Come on, spread out now!

37:21.303 --> 37:22.770
- Come! Over here!
- Joseph!

37:22.938 --> 37:25.236
- Make sure you stick together, hear?
- Let's go!

37:31.347 --> 37:33.212
No! Don't take her.

37:33.382 --> 37:36.510
You know what they'll do to you
if you're branded a sympathizer?

37:37.653 --> 37:40.850
- You'll be killed along with them.
- Then let me be killed.

37:53.736 --> 37:56.398
Aspirin must be downstairs.
Is my head supposed to hurt?

37:56.572 --> 37:59.507
No, you'll be fine.
It was just a small amount of blood.

37:59.675 --> 38:01.768
It should pass out of your system
by tomorrow.

38:05.848 --> 38:06.906
Are you okay?

38:08.717 --> 38:11.413
Damon was right. This is, uh...

38:12.221 --> 38:13.688
This is my fault.

38:17.359 --> 38:18.383
Look over there!

38:21.263 --> 38:24.061
Damon! Damon, stop. Stop.

38:25.701 --> 38:26.759
I'll help you.

38:26.936 --> 38:29.928
- We'll get her back.
- Don't you think you've done enough?

38:30.406 --> 38:34.775
- You promised you wouldn't tell him.
- I didn't think this would happen.

38:37.579 --> 38:39.570
There she is!

38:41.784 --> 38:43.718
You did this.

38:44.620 --> 38:46.713
This is your fault.

38:49.358 --> 38:51.724
I put my faith in my father.

38:51.894 --> 38:53.759
But Damon put his faith in me.

38:53.929 --> 38:57.057
And I destroyed that.

38:58.567 --> 39:00.558
This is my fault.

39:00.803 --> 39:03.067
We didn't do anything wrong.

39:03.906 --> 39:05.396
Don't forget that.

39:07.142 --> 39:08.166
Okay.

39:10.779 --> 39:13.111
- I'm gonna get you that aspirin. Okay?
- Mm.

39:24.560 --> 39:27.120
You know
you're not staying the night, right?

39:27.563 --> 39:30.794
Oh, uh, we're just gonna hang out
for a little while.

39:30.966 --> 39:32.957
You're lucky I like you.

39:33.135 --> 39:35.695
- Keep the door open.
- You got it.

39:35.904 --> 39:39.271
- Hey, do you have any aspirin?
- Yeah.

39:41.143 --> 39:43.634
Oh, hey, Stefan.

39:45.014 --> 39:47.175
- Where did she go?
- She went to the bathroom.

39:48.484 --> 39:50.850
- Where did who go?
- He has a friend over.

39:51.020 --> 39:52.612
Anna.

40:02.364 --> 40:04.229
What's happening?

40:04.500 --> 40:07.230
Get Emily. And stay hidden.

40:07.636 --> 40:08.830
I'll get us out of here.

40:17.179 --> 40:19.579
- Pearl!
- Johnathan.

40:21.583 --> 40:24.552
You see all this? The town's gone mad
rounding up the demons.

40:39.768 --> 40:41.235
You?

40:41.570 --> 40:42.969
L...

40:44.740 --> 40:47.208
Johnathan, please.

40:50.913 --> 40:52.676
I beg you.

40:54.116 --> 40:55.981
I've got another one over here!

40:59.721 --> 41:01.120
- Mother!
- Shh!

41:06.762 --> 41:08.252
No!

41:13.435 --> 41:15.494
Johnathan, this way!

41:18.107 --> 41:21.406
[WHISPERS] Shh. It'll be all right.
You're gonna see her again.

41:24.513 --> 41:27.641
I already know how to protect them.
I'm gonna protect them.

41:30.786 --> 41:32.253
There's gotta be more!

41:33.789 --> 41:35.654
Don't let her get away.

41:46.902 --> 41:48.130
Elena?
