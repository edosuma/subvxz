00:04.505 --> 00:05.755
Previously on Chicago Fire...

00:05.923 --> 00:07.674
I've seen him at two different
fire scenes.

00:07.841 --> 00:09.133
We got a firebug here?

00:09.301 --> 00:10.635
What do you carry around in
that backpack there?

00:10.803 --> 00:12.261
Get away from me.
You don't know me.

00:12.680 --> 00:15.932
Leon. I'm gonna come
pick you up. No speeches.
I just want to get you home.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.519
I need a refill.
I can pay you for them.

00:21.230 --> 00:22.897
Did you hear about
Hallie and Casey?
What?

00:23.065 --> 00:24.065
They're splitting up.

00:24.692 --> 00:25.817
You okay?

00:25.984 --> 00:27.235
Yeah. I'm good.

00:32.866 --> 00:34.492
Hey. I texted you
a couple times.

00:34.660 --> 00:37.286
I'm sorry. I've just been
dealing with something.

00:37.454 --> 00:39.247
I'm not looking to bring any
drama to her life.

00:39.415 --> 00:41.332
No, I hear ya.
Keep it short and sweet.
That's my policy.

00:41.500 --> 00:42.750
Exactly.

00:42.918 --> 00:44.794
Real quick. Corrine,
do you have any claim to her?

00:45.337 --> 00:46.713
Knock yourself out.

01:03.480 --> 01:04.981
Have a good day.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.275
Yeah. You too.

01:21.081 --> 01:22.290
You feel better?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.459
Feel like you
accomplished something?

01:26.920 --> 01:28.045
By the way,

01:30.841 --> 01:32.633
she's not 100% lesbian.

01:37.639 --> 01:38.931
What?

01:39.767 --> 01:41.517
You said it was cool.

01:51.236 --> 01:53.488
Saw it getting hot.
Smoke started coming in.

01:53.655 --> 01:56.783
I turn around, the next thing
I know, fire's coming in
through the window.

01:56.950 --> 01:59.619
We tried to spray it,
but it got too hot
and the propane tank blew...

01:59.787 --> 02:01.287
Anything else combustible
in there?

02:01.455 --> 02:03.873
A bunch of cylinders.
Oxygen. Acetylene.

02:04.041 --> 02:07.210
Truck 81, pull those tanks out
before this turns into
the Fourth of July.

02:07.377 --> 02:08.920
Squad, you're on search.

02:11.715 --> 02:14.300
Hey, isn't that that kid,
Ernie, from the
Thanksgiving dinner?

02:21.850 --> 02:25.520
Main room's clear of hazardous
materials. No workers in here.

02:25.687 --> 02:27.230
Haven't checked
the supply room yet...

02:27.397 --> 02:28.606
We got it!

02:32.444 --> 02:33.861
Lieutenant!
Somebody's in the corner.

02:34.029 --> 02:37.532
Okay! Grab his legs. Hadley,
Capp, finish the sweep...

02:37.699 --> 02:38.950
We're on it.

02:40.327 --> 02:41.953
Let's get two attack lines
ready in the back.

02:42.120 --> 02:43.120
Right, sir.

02:46.708 --> 02:48.584
One, two, three, go!

02:51.129 --> 02:53.422
Truck's still engaged. I need
you two to vent the roof.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.091
On it.

02:58.220 --> 03:00.638
Hey! Supply room's clear!

03:00.806 --> 03:02.807
Take one of these.
Got it.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.101
All yours, Rich.

03:05.769 --> 03:06.811
Give me more line!

03:13.360 --> 03:14.944
How we doing on that vent?

03:15.946 --> 03:17.280
We're venting.
Making progress.

03:23.245 --> 03:24.704
Clear out!
Clear out!

03:30.127 --> 03:31.127
Vargas!

03:33.505 --> 03:35.882
Mayday! Mayday!
Firefighter down!

03:36.049 --> 03:39.343
We've got a downed firefighter
on the roof!
Get a ladder up there, now!

03:44.850 --> 03:47.059
Vargas? Can you hear me?

03:47.227 --> 03:49.729
Take nice, slow breaths
for us, Vargas.

03:49.897 --> 03:52.023
We're gonna get you to
the hospital in no time, okay?

03:52.566 --> 03:54.567
Just hang in there for us.
You guys ready?
Yeah.

03:54.735 --> 03:55.735
We need a hand.

04:17.132 --> 04:20.343
Hey! Hey. Did you torch
this place, huh,
you little tweeker?

04:20.510 --> 04:22.803
I'm watching.
You're watching it?
Did you do it?

04:22.971 --> 04:24.972
Huh?
Kelly! That's enough.

04:26.433 --> 04:29.060
That's two fires,
two dumpsters,
same kid!

04:29.227 --> 04:30.561
Walk it off, Kelly.

04:30.979 --> 04:31.812
I am handling this.

04:31.980 --> 04:34.440
Why don't you invite him back
for apple pie? Keep him close.

04:34.608 --> 04:36.484
That's the plan, right?

04:57.631 --> 04:59.298
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

04:59.466 --> 05:02.718
I know you're all concerned
about what happened to Vargas
on the last shift.

05:03.178 --> 05:06.931
Hospital has treated him
and released him.
He's resting up.

05:08.767 --> 05:10.226
But he is not out of
the woods.

05:11.687 --> 05:15.356
Hazmat has confirmed
magnesium shavings were in
the bin at the machine shop,

05:15.524 --> 05:17.984
which you all know,
is reactive with water.

05:18.151 --> 05:19.485
Magnesium inhalation.

05:19.653 --> 05:22.613
He's got burns on his lungs
and an upper respiratory
tract infection.

05:23.365 --> 05:24.532
So when are we gonna
see him again?

05:24.700 --> 05:26.617
We won't know until we get
the test results.

05:27.452 --> 05:30.329
But look, he's gonna be fine.
No matter what happens.

05:31.999 --> 05:33.082
Okay?

05:37.546 --> 05:38.879
My office, now.

05:45.762 --> 05:46.721
Door.

05:50.225 --> 05:52.268
If you ever talk to me
like that in front of
the men again,

05:52.436 --> 05:54.395
you will see a side of me
that you won't forget.

05:54.563 --> 05:56.188
With all due respect,
I've gotta protect my men.

05:56.356 --> 05:57.898
And I am doing what?

05:58.066 --> 05:59.900
Walking around with
my thumb up my ass?

06:00.068 --> 06:02.611
He is a firebug. Plain as day.

06:02.779 --> 06:04.864
I am taking care of this!

06:06.033 --> 06:07.199
Do you understand me?

06:09.036 --> 06:10.036
Step back.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.947
Hey, you've reached
Jose Vargas.
Please leave a message.

06:48.742 --> 06:49.784
Hey. Anything?

06:50.202 --> 06:51.202
He's not picking up.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.579
All right, well, let me know
if anyone's planning on
going over there.

06:53.747 --> 06:56.040
Dawson and I want in.
You got it.

06:56.208 --> 06:59.710
Oh, hey, um...
Dawson's landlord
is being a dick about repairs,

06:59.878 --> 07:01.712
her kitchen window
leaks every time it rains

07:01.880 --> 07:03.047
and he won't do
anything about it.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.509
Really? She hasn't said
anything to me...

07:06.676 --> 07:08.886
Oh, she didn't want to come
off like a mooch.
But anyhow, she tried

07:09.054 --> 07:11.764
to fix it herself and now the
window won't go up or down.

07:11.932 --> 07:14.058
Oh. Well, I'll uh...
I'll talk to her.

07:15.018 --> 07:16.894
Great, thanks.
Yeah.

07:17.062 --> 07:18.062
Cool.

07:26.613 --> 07:28.614
You should've said something
about your window.

07:29.908 --> 07:31.867
You want greater
Chicago to know your business,

07:32.035 --> 07:33.244
make sure you tell
Leslie Shay.

07:33.411 --> 07:34.995
I can put in a new
one for you.

07:35.163 --> 07:38.082
Oh, I don't...
I don't like asking favors.

07:38.834 --> 07:40.626
Good thing you didn't ask.

07:50.053 --> 07:54.098
The fire at the machine shop.
Do you know how it started?

07:59.729 --> 08:03.357
Do you remember Jose Vargas?
From the firehouse?

08:04.693 --> 08:06.944
His lungs are burned.
Pretty bad.

08:10.240 --> 08:11.949
I told you I don't know
anything...

08:12.117 --> 08:13.784
But if you did know something,

08:14.744 --> 08:15.911
now would be the time for you
to speak up,

08:16.079 --> 08:18.247
because that way
I could still help you out.

08:26.965 --> 08:28.883
It's not my fault...

08:29.050 --> 08:30.217
What's not your fault?

08:31.511 --> 08:33.095
Come on, son.
Talk to me.

08:34.472 --> 08:36.348
Whatever it is,
we can make it right.

08:37.058 --> 08:38.392
We can get you some help.

08:40.103 --> 08:42.479
I wanna bring my grandma.
That's fine.

08:42.981 --> 08:45.608
Truck 81, elevator accident...

08:46.026 --> 08:48.068
You come down to
the station by 2:00.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.988
No one's gonna hurt you
anymore, Ernie.

08:55.160 --> 08:57.161
Station by 2:00, okay?

09:08.924 --> 09:10.049
What's the word?

09:10.217 --> 09:12.009
A bank of elevators
stopped working.
One of them's stuck.

09:12.177 --> 09:14.845
Somebody in there was calling
for help, but now nobody's
answering the phone.

09:15.013 --> 09:16.722
What floor?
It's the express.
It could be anywhere

09:16.890 --> 09:18.057
between the lobby and
the tenth floor.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.809
Let's start on ten and get
a bird's-eye view.

09:34.574 --> 09:35.574
This one.

09:39.162 --> 09:40.746
Got it?
Yeah.

09:43.083 --> 09:44.083
Good!

09:49.089 --> 09:52.633
This is the fire department.
Can anybody hear me?

09:56.304 --> 09:59.098
Mills, Cruz, Herrmann,
throw a rope.

09:59.266 --> 10:02.393
I'll get in the hoist way.
Otis, get up to the motor room
and take over the power.

10:03.186 --> 10:07.189
Ah, Mouch, you, uh,
stay right here and take
command of the floor, huh?

10:17.826 --> 10:19.410
Power is down on all
elevators.

10:21.579 --> 10:22.997
Peter Mills,
your line's secure.

10:31.756 --> 10:32.923
Line secured!

10:33.466 --> 10:34.633
All right.
Yeah.

10:57.907 --> 10:58.907
Hello?

11:03.913 --> 11:05.789
Elevator's empty
except for a safe.

11:05.957 --> 11:07.791
It's gotta weigh
a ton, at least.

11:16.634 --> 11:17.634
What the hell?

11:20.555 --> 11:21.555
I didn't do it.

11:28.730 --> 11:31.065
Hey, buddy, I came down
here to help you.

11:31.775 --> 11:34.902
You didn't hear me yelling?
Please,
I don't want any help.

11:35.070 --> 11:37.071
Clearly. What's your name?

11:37.238 --> 11:38.781
I don't wanna say.

11:39.240 --> 11:40.240
I'm not a cop.

11:43.703 --> 11:46.246
Fine. I'll call you Ralph.
Ralph, don't do anything...

11:46.414 --> 11:47.664
It's Mark.

11:47.832 --> 11:50.292
All right, Mark,
don't do anything stupid.

11:52.587 --> 11:54.129
I mean, don't do anything
stupid again.

11:54.631 --> 11:55.589
Oh, God...

11:55.757 --> 11:58.467
Elevator's dead until that
safe's out, Casey.

11:58.635 --> 12:01.011
Drop me a rescue harness.
On it!

12:01.763 --> 12:04.848
I only noticed the safe
was missing when I got back
from a meeting.

12:05.016 --> 12:06.767
Well, it ain't going
anywhere now.

12:10.021 --> 12:14.691
I told her I needed 45,
and she just said,
"Take it or leave it."

12:15.276 --> 12:16.860
Looks like you took it.

12:17.946 --> 12:19.571
We'll have him out
of there soon.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.865
Never hire family.

12:24.285 --> 12:26.328
The money never left
the building.

12:26.830 --> 12:28.872
Maybe Betts and I
can work something out.

12:29.040 --> 12:31.625
There you go.
Now, when I say the word...

12:32.085 --> 12:33.168
Not yet!

12:36.339 --> 12:39.967
I can't hold on.
Help me! Help me...
Hold on!

12:40.593 --> 12:42.428
I'm coming for ya.

12:42.595 --> 12:46.807
Casey, put your line back on!
Gimme your hand. Come on.

12:46.975 --> 12:49.017
Stay calm. Here,
now hold onto the beam.

12:49.185 --> 12:50.769
Grab the beam. Got it?
Yeah.

12:50.937 --> 12:56.316
Okay. Lean on the other hand.
One step at a time...
Edge it along... I got ya...

12:56.484 --> 12:57.651
Ahhh!

12:58.111 --> 13:02.030
Hold on! Get your feet up!
I got you.
Help me...

13:02.198 --> 13:03.782
Please don't drop me...
I got you.

13:03.950 --> 13:07.870
Get your feet up. I got you.
I got you.
I'm not gonna drop you.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.998
Keep going, you're okay.

13:14.669 --> 13:16.837
I got him. Up on line...

13:17.005 --> 13:18.422
Ready to haul.
Haul.

13:19.048 --> 13:21.508
Put your feet up.

13:22.469 --> 13:23.469
Keep comin'.

13:26.931 --> 13:28.765
And then... stop!
Stop right there!

13:31.853 --> 13:32.853
All right!

13:35.106 --> 13:37.441
You okay?
Let's go over to the chair.

13:41.070 --> 13:43.864
Well, sir, you look okay.
Do you hurt anywhere?

13:44.032 --> 13:45.199
I feel sick.

13:46.993 --> 13:47.951
You'll be all right.

13:48.119 --> 13:51.455
What am I supposed
to tell Mom? Huh? You dropout.

13:54.751 --> 13:58.504
Yo, Mouch. I think I left my
kit upstairs. Can you run up
and grab it for me?

13:58.671 --> 14:01.798
I'd give you the finger,
but that'd require too
much energy.

14:06.471 --> 14:07.513
Hello?

14:09.349 --> 14:11.058
Yeah, I'll accept the charges.

14:13.436 --> 14:17.231
Leon, you better not be
calling me from where I think
you're calling.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.027
Lieutenant?
Yeah.

14:22.695 --> 14:26.281
My little brother got pinched
in a robbery. Unarmed.
Petty theft.

14:26.449 --> 14:29.535
Anyway, he's at County
and if I could get an hour,
I need to bail him out.

14:31.704 --> 14:33.914
Get us back to 51 and
then do what you gotta do.

14:34.374 --> 14:35.541
You sure?

14:36.167 --> 14:37.167
Are you?

14:38.002 --> 14:39.169
He's family.

14:46.010 --> 14:48.136
Casey, hey.

14:48.763 --> 14:51.306
Uh, hypothetical.
A friend comes over
to your house

14:51.474 --> 14:52.516
to help out with something.

14:52.934 --> 14:56.603
Do you repay your friend with
your phenomenal
arroz con pollo picante?

14:56.771 --> 14:58.855
Or a six-pack of his
favorite beer?

15:03.486 --> 15:06.530
Hypothetically, your friend
can bring his own beer.

15:06.698 --> 15:12.077
However, he can barely say
arroz con pollo picante...

15:14.163 --> 15:15.163
Let alone cook it.

15:16.624 --> 15:17.624
Got it.

15:23.089 --> 15:26.967
Look at you. All lit up
like a Christmas tree.

15:27.135 --> 15:28.927
What? No, I just...

15:29.095 --> 15:31.179
I asked him if he wanted me
to make dinner.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.516
Uh-huh.
Hey. We are not talking
about this.

15:34.684 --> 15:36.393
Seriously, how long
has it been?

15:36.561 --> 15:40.689
He just dumped his fiancee,
Shay. But, yeah, it's been
a while.

15:40.857 --> 15:45.152
Right. That's why you gotta
get in there, pick up the
rebound, and slam it on home.

15:45.320 --> 15:47.446
Okay. I'm about to slam
something in a minute.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.993
Live and in person,
Jose Vargas...

15:53.161 --> 15:56.163
Ah, there he is!
Good to see you, buddy.

15:56.331 --> 15:59.207
Lieutenant.
What's up, man?

16:01.878 --> 16:04.796
Are you staying for lunch?
We're having brisket.

16:08.134 --> 16:10.093
He's staying.
Come on, let's eat!

16:14.974 --> 16:16.767
Ambulance 61,
man down, unknown causes...

16:16.934 --> 16:18.560
Save me some of that.
Sure.

16:19.020 --> 16:21.688
...716 South Morgan Drive.

16:26.944 --> 16:31.490
Sorry.
Doctors got me huffing on a
nebulizer four times a day.

16:31.991 --> 16:34.117
Plus this inhaler.

16:35.787 --> 16:36.953
Busy day so far?

16:37.121 --> 16:38.955
Uh, no, no. Not too bad.

16:47.507 --> 16:50.926
Casey, Severide,
Chief's asking for you.

16:58.267 --> 17:01.937
This is Dr. Tenney,
CFD medical director.

17:02.105 --> 17:03.105
Gentlemen.

17:03.731 --> 17:07.567
I wanted to bring you men in
since Vargas served under both
your command.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.113
His labs suggest chronic
obstructive pulmonary disease.

17:11.280 --> 17:12.280
What's that?

17:12.448 --> 17:17.536
He'll develop emphysema,
which means his lungs will
gradually deteriorate.

17:17.704 --> 17:20.831
He won't be able to
breathe the normal amount
of air, which...

17:20.998 --> 17:26.128
could lead to other issues,
weight loss, skeletal muscle
dysfunction, heart problems...

17:27.255 --> 17:30.048
There's just no way he can
handle the demands of the job.

17:30.216 --> 17:32.843
He's out there right now,
Chief. He looks good.

17:33.010 --> 17:36.972
We are placing him on
long-term disability.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.100
I wanted you two
to know what was happening.

17:40.560 --> 17:43.228
When I get all this
paperwork together,
I will talk to Vargas.

17:47.567 --> 17:48.775
We'll tell him.

17:54.449 --> 17:56.950
So that's it?
I'm sorry, Vargas.

17:58.494 --> 17:59.870
It could happen to any of us.

18:00.371 --> 18:01.955
Well, be glad it
didn't happen to you.

18:02.415 --> 18:05.834
Hey. You're getting paid.
Three-quarters salary.

18:08.087 --> 18:10.172
Yeah.
It's not what anybody wants,

18:10.339 --> 18:12.591
but any of us would
take that deal.

18:14.093 --> 18:16.261
How about you, Kelly?
Would you take that deal?

18:16.429 --> 18:17.679
Uh...

18:19.640 --> 18:21.057
They're not offering a choice.

18:21.726 --> 18:23.185
You still doing landscaping?

18:24.020 --> 18:26.521
Yeah. Whenever my buddy
needs another guy.

18:26.689 --> 18:29.149
Take the 75%o,
start your own business.

18:29.317 --> 18:31.902
Or go ride Harleys with your
brother like you talked about.

18:32.069 --> 18:33.403
He moved to Albuquerque.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.242
You and me should both
be taking 75%.

18:59.430 --> 19:00.722
Did you see a doctor?

19:02.975 --> 19:04.643
Your shoulder.
Do you think no one's noticed?

19:04.811 --> 19:07.312
It's my neck, and,
I saw a doctor.

19:07.480 --> 19:09.731
She said there's
nothing to worry about it.
So I'm not worrying about it.

19:09.899 --> 19:14.027
It's your business,
but if it's an issue for you,
it's an issue for all of us.

19:14.195 --> 19:15.111
Then we're good.

19:19.867 --> 19:24.621
Squad 3, Engine 51,
single car accident,
5512 South Franklin...

19:37.176 --> 19:39.052
Car's energized!
Keep your distance!

19:39.220 --> 19:41.638
Tony, get on the horn with
ComEd and get this line cut.

19:42.348 --> 19:43.723
Watch it, guys.

19:44.642 --> 19:47.686
Uh, I knew just to not
get out of the car...

19:47.854 --> 19:50.063
You knew right. You hurt?
No, I don't think so.

19:50.731 --> 19:55.610
What happened?
Well this animal darted right
out in front of my car...

19:55.778 --> 19:58.154
Well, looks like you missed
him, so PETA will be happy.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.323
Just give us a sec.
Severide...

20:03.744 --> 20:05.453
All right, we can't wait
for the power company.

20:05.621 --> 20:08.373
Wait, what's happening?
Just stay in the car.
Hadley, throw me the rope bag.

20:16.132 --> 20:17.257
Oh, my God.

20:18.509 --> 20:19.593
Is everything
gonna be okay?

20:19.760 --> 20:21.678
Yeah, I promise.
You're gonna be fine.

20:45.786 --> 20:47.245
You good?
Good.

20:53.628 --> 20:55.670
Ooh... oh...
See? Safe and sound.

20:58.925 --> 21:00.383
Okay.

21:00.551 --> 21:02.260
Come here. You want a
backboard or a stretcher?

21:02.428 --> 21:05.055
No, no. God,
what I need is a massage.

21:05.848 --> 21:10.101
No, I'm... I'm good.
I'm, uh... I'm okay.

21:11.145 --> 21:14.481
All right.
All right, well, these guys'll
check you out to make sure.

21:17.610 --> 21:19.277
Uh, thank you...

21:33.626 --> 21:34.751
You're moving in with me.

21:34.919 --> 21:36.127
Yo, whatever.

21:36.754 --> 21:39.839
Whatever? How about
"thanks for saving my ass"?

21:40.883 --> 21:44.177
We weren't raised like this.
You're turning your back
on your familia.

21:44.345 --> 21:45.929
Yo, I got a different
family now.

21:46.097 --> 21:49.808
What the hell is
the matter with you?
Look at where we are!

21:49.976 --> 21:52.143
I can't keep chasing after you
your whole life
cleaning up your mess.

21:52.311 --> 21:53.853
Yo, then don't.

21:57.650 --> 22:02.195
You wanna die in a gang?
Like Moco? Like Ruiz?

22:27.513 --> 22:28.972
Blackboy?
That's your word?

22:29.140 --> 22:32.976
It's a plant.
And a triple word score.

22:33.144 --> 22:36.688
Hey, Dawson, if I said "Let's
get a bunch of blackboys in
here to decorate the house"

22:36.856 --> 22:37.856
what would you think?

22:38.399 --> 22:40.066
Uh, I'm not touching that one.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.777
Should I go get the
dictionary? It's a word.

22:42.945 --> 22:44.571
Wait. I saved you a plate.

22:50.202 --> 22:51.995
Thanks.

22:53.581 --> 22:55.540
Um, yeah,
I could make you somethin'.

22:55.708 --> 22:59.419
Oh, no.
Don't trouble yourself.

22:59.587 --> 23:02.756
Peter Mills, I had two
sunflower seeds in the ambo.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.803
Ernie here yet?

23:08.971 --> 23:09.971
Not yet.

23:11.849 --> 23:14.517
I know you don't wanna
do this, Chief, but...

23:15.895 --> 23:16.936
You gotta do this.

23:18.314 --> 23:19.856
I just want to believe
he's a good kid.

23:20.024 --> 23:24.110
But you're not doing anybody
any favors by waiting for this
kid to do the right thing.

23:24.278 --> 23:26.279
And putting him in
the system does what?

23:28.741 --> 23:30.241
What choice do you have?

23:31.327 --> 23:32.327
Let it slide?

23:34.038 --> 23:35.914
Hope that he changes
on his own?

23:48.469 --> 23:50.637
Remember me? I tried to
electrocute you earlier?

23:50.805 --> 23:51.805
I remember.

23:53.557 --> 23:55.433
For you. Chocolates.

23:55.601 --> 23:57.310
Well, thanks. But it's not...

23:57.478 --> 24:01.189
No, no, please. I mean, it
doesn't even begin to repay
you for all your help.

24:01.357 --> 24:02.482
Miss...

24:02.650 --> 24:04.526
Uh, Renee Royce.
Ah.

24:04.693 --> 24:05.902
Call me Renee.

24:06.070 --> 24:08.363
Umm.
Look, my services are free.

24:14.495 --> 24:16.287
This is gonna sound, um...

24:17.081 --> 24:18.081
Okay, what the hell.

24:19.834 --> 24:23.461
Do you wanna have lunch
or coffee some time?

24:25.756 --> 24:27.757
It doesn't have
to be today...
It's a really nice offer...

24:27.925 --> 24:30.135
Come on. Just say yes.

24:30.928 --> 24:32.595
Miss Royce?
Yes?

24:33.055 --> 24:35.598
There's a well-known
phenomenon where people
who've been rescued

24:35.766 --> 24:37.725
become attracted to
the men that help them.

24:38.978 --> 24:40.937
Believe me, this will wear off
in 30 minutes, tops.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.825
Thank you again.

24:53.993 --> 24:55.994
Yeah. It was my pleasure.

25:08.716 --> 25:11.301
Hey, I heard the news.
I'm sorry, man.

25:17.725 --> 25:21.769
Want a yo-yo? Even as a kid,
I could never figure out
how to do it.

25:22.396 --> 25:24.522
Otis says I gotta
snap my wrist more.

25:26.650 --> 25:30.111
How long did it take?
To get from Truck to Squad?

25:30.821 --> 25:34.824
Sixteen years.
My whole career.

25:36.785 --> 25:38.745
Five weeks to get booted out.

25:44.668 --> 25:47.086
On the bright side,
there's a spot open now.

25:47.796 --> 25:51.007
No...
Yo, I wasn't even thinking...
I would never...

25:51.175 --> 25:55.887
Mills. When you get the
opportunity, grab it.

26:05.481 --> 26:06.689
It ain't easy.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.752
This is from all of us.

26:50.943 --> 26:51.776
Thanks, guys.

26:52.945 --> 26:54.279
This is, uh...

26:56.782 --> 26:58.116
It sure ain't pretty.

27:00.703 --> 27:03.246
But I love it. Thanks.

27:08.502 --> 27:10.753
It was an honor to serve with
you at this house, Vargas.

27:11.422 --> 27:12.797
Thanks, Chief.

27:16.135 --> 27:17.260
You lucky bastard.

27:18.762 --> 27:21.639
Hey, brother.
He's right, man.

27:23.684 --> 27:25.935
Just... get well soon.

27:36.363 --> 27:38.114
Take it easy, Vargas.
Take it easy, man.

27:40.409 --> 27:42.702
Keep an eye on him.
Both of you.

27:57.843 --> 28:00.178
Hey.
Wallace!

28:00.346 --> 28:02.597
Thanks for seeing me
on such short notice.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.017
We gotta catch up some time.
Off duty.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.352
You don't
have to tell me twice.

28:07.519 --> 28:09.520
Sit, sit. So whatcha got?

28:10.064 --> 28:12.857
We think we have
at least two major fires
that are connected.

28:13.025 --> 28:16.611
Both of them started in
dumpsters. Both possibly
started by a 14-year-old kid

28:16.779 --> 28:18.696
who has been seen
at three incidents.

28:19.365 --> 28:23.242
Record of station visits,
phone correspondence,
medical history, SSI data.

28:24.119 --> 28:25.870
Dad's doing 30 years in Tamms.

28:27.039 --> 28:28.456
Mom OD'd a year ago.

28:30.042 --> 28:31.042
He's a good kid.

28:32.378 --> 28:34.003
Someday he's going to
kill somebody.

29:03.200 --> 29:04.492
Flaco.

29:07.371 --> 29:09.580
Is that Joe Cruz?

29:10.332 --> 29:12.166
Damn. We ain't seen
you for a minute.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.002
What up, man?

29:15.754 --> 29:17.088
I appreciate you
taking the time.

29:17.256 --> 29:19.382
Ah, we go back,
you and me.

29:19.842 --> 29:21.634
I wanted to talk to
you about my brother.

29:21.802 --> 29:23.052
Yeah? I heard you
bailed him out.

29:23.220 --> 29:24.303
Yeah.

29:24.471 --> 29:27.432
That's cool.
But you ain't gotta worry
about Puppet, though.

29:29.101 --> 29:33.438
I'm watching out for
him. Personally.

29:36.525 --> 29:37.942
Look, he ain't cut
out for your crew.

29:39.319 --> 29:43.322
Now,
I'd love to help you out, bro,
but I put in time with him.

29:44.074 --> 29:45.950
Been grooming him
for a while now.

29:47.119 --> 29:48.119
You wanna buy-out,

29:48.996 --> 29:50.079
you gotta drop ten K.

29:51.331 --> 29:53.499
What?
Time is money, man.

29:55.461 --> 29:57.003
I don't have it.

29:59.298 --> 30:02.508
And even if I did,
I put in time with Leon.

30:03.218 --> 30:07.638
A lot more than you.
So the way I see it,
maybe you owe me something.

30:14.605 --> 30:18.983
You got heart.
I'll give you that.
And loyalty.

30:20.194 --> 30:26.240
Ain't nothin' more important
than loyalty to your
hermanos, right?

30:31.580 --> 30:32.747
Okay.

30:37.586 --> 30:38.586
We're cool?

30:39.922 --> 30:41.255
As cucumbers.

30:49.223 --> 30:51.390
If we're having
this same conversation
a year from now...

30:52.935 --> 30:56.062
I swear to you,
he's all yours.

31:00.943 --> 31:06.781
Sea salt sarsaparilla?
What the hell kind
of chocolate is this?

31:07.366 --> 31:08.407
Where's the nougat?

31:08.575 --> 31:09.867
I love this one.

31:10.035 --> 31:10.993
It's junk.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.078
What?

31:12.246 --> 31:14.830
With our winters, you want one
made with wood fiber

31:14.998 --> 31:16.165
strengthened with
PVC polymers.

31:16.333 --> 31:17.333
This one's so cute.

31:20.671 --> 31:21.671
I...

31:23.006 --> 31:24.632
Can't compete with cute.

31:24.800 --> 31:25.800
Mmm.

31:29.221 --> 31:30.555
Hey...
What's shaking, Sparkles?

31:31.765 --> 31:32.723
What's up with you?

31:32.891 --> 31:33.891
Nothin'.

31:35.978 --> 31:37.853
You on something again?
What?

31:38.647 --> 31:42.608
I know I'm not giving you
painkillers. You'd think after
Thanksgiving you'd...

31:42.776 --> 31:44.735
No, I'm finally
feeling better, Shay.

31:44.903 --> 31:46.237
When I have a good day,
I don't question it.

31:46.405 --> 31:48.114
So maybe you
shouldn't, either.

31:48.282 --> 31:50.950
And, by the way, didn't we
have an agreement when we
first moved in

31:51.118 --> 31:52.577
that we wouldn't get
in each other's business?

31:52.744 --> 31:55.788
This isn't some
personal thing, this is
serious what you're doing.

31:55.956 --> 31:57.498
I'm not doing anything.

32:01.169 --> 32:02.169
Anyhow...

32:05.215 --> 32:07.300
I came to tell you there's
someone looking for
you on the floor.

32:17.978 --> 32:21.147
It has been over 30
minutes and it
hasn't worn off.

32:24.109 --> 32:25.651
Well, how about that.

32:25.819 --> 32:28.613
Because you made me wait,
it is now going to be dinner.

32:29.698 --> 32:30.865
Is it?

32:31.033 --> 32:33.743
Have you ever been to
Francesca's? Because we're
in for tomorrow night.

32:38.915 --> 32:39.915
Where is this place?

32:42.502 --> 32:44.920
The injury you want
is to get shot in the foot.

32:45.088 --> 32:46.172
With the right angle,
you could blow that...

32:46.340 --> 32:49.550
Severide. Tell me that
lady you were just with
wasn't the same woman

32:49.718 --> 32:50.926
that you saved
from the wreck.

32:51.094 --> 32:52.094
Why? Is she your sister?

32:53.180 --> 32:57.224
Doctors don't date patients.
Lawyers don't date clients.

32:57.392 --> 32:58.684
Victims are off-limits
to firefighters.

32:58.852 --> 33:00.186
Uh, actually, there's nothing

33:00.354 --> 33:02.897
in the union bylaws that
says you can't date a victim.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.442
And I might add,
these chocolates?
A little too fancy pants...

33:06.610 --> 33:09.612
So don't eat 'em...
Oh!
Hey, I didn't say inedible.

33:14.034 --> 33:16.327
Vargas. Hey.
You forget something?

33:16.953 --> 33:20.289
You said come back anytime.
Of course. Yeah.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.668
Hey, you keep showing up
like this, you're gonna
give Mills a big head.

33:25.796 --> 33:26.796
Hey, man.

33:29.925 --> 33:33.260
Hey. Who's drinking
after shift? I'm buying.

33:33.428 --> 33:35.846
Ah, jeez, I wish I could,
but Lee Henry's
got a hockey game...

33:36.014 --> 33:40.518
Hey, if you're still buying
next week, I am totally free
Saturday and Sunday...

33:43.480 --> 33:44.605
No problem.

34:11.216 --> 34:12.258
Fire's out, Chief.

34:12.801 --> 34:16.345
Any idea what happened?
Yeah, a dumpster fire in
the back spread to the house.

34:42.789 --> 34:43.748
You got anything for me?

34:43.915 --> 34:46.333
Sent a couple guys over
to the kid's grandma's house.

34:46.501 --> 34:49.754
Nobody's there. Got a hit
on something else, though.

34:49.921 --> 34:51.464
The grandma's
the legal guardian.

34:51.631 --> 34:54.091
But his SSI checks, they're
going to another address.

34:54.718 --> 34:55.760
Text me.

35:17.866 --> 35:18.866
Ernie?

35:20.494 --> 35:21.535
What are you doing here?

35:22.579 --> 35:27.374
Did you start that fire?

35:27.542 --> 35:29.418
The cops were at my house.

35:29.586 --> 35:31.545
Why didn't you come to the
fire station like we agreed?

35:32.339 --> 35:33.672
You ratted me out.

35:34.257 --> 35:35.257
I am trying to help you.

35:35.801 --> 35:39.595
I didn't do anything wrong.
Everything's all messed up.

35:39.763 --> 35:40.763
What's messed up?

35:41.348 --> 35:42.807
You have to go.
Get out of here. Go!

35:42.974 --> 35:44.517
Hey, hey, hey!

35:49.272 --> 35:50.272
Who the hell are you?

35:50.857 --> 35:52.525
Wallace Boden.
How do you know Ernie?

35:53.902 --> 35:55.820
I'm his uncle.

35:58.281 --> 35:59.281
You okay, Ernie?

36:00.283 --> 36:01.367
He's my Uncle Ray.

36:04.663 --> 36:07.790
What's going on here?
What're you doing to that kid?

36:07.958 --> 36:09.625
I said, what are you doing
to that kid?

36:09.793 --> 36:10.793
You a cop?

36:16.675 --> 36:18.801
Hey, Ernie! Ernie!

36:30.939 --> 36:32.231
You stay the whole shift?

36:33.650 --> 36:34.650
Old habits...

36:39.906 --> 36:40.906
You still free tonight?

36:43.159 --> 36:45.411
How long were you hanging off
the side of that balcony?

36:45.871 --> 36:47.121
Long enough.

36:48.290 --> 36:50.833
If I hadn't raised that ladder
when I did, he would've had

36:51.001 --> 36:52.751
nothing but pavement
to break his fall.

36:52.919 --> 36:53.794
Wow.

37:02.846 --> 37:05.264
Yeah,
sorry I crashed your date.

37:05.432 --> 37:07.850
Oh, no, no, no, stop it.
It was, uh... it was fun.

37:08.018 --> 37:10.019
I've never seen you talk
that much in my life.

37:11.187 --> 37:12.938
Okay. See you guys.

37:16.026 --> 37:20.279
I appreciate you making
it three. He's... struggling.

37:27.787 --> 37:28.954
You're a good man.

37:47.641 --> 37:48.641
Leon!

37:52.062 --> 37:53.270
Oh, my God, Leon...

37:53.438 --> 37:55.439
What the hell did you do?

38:01.071 --> 38:02.196
No record of an uncle.

38:03.114 --> 38:06.951
But then in that part of town
you get a lot of unofficial
uncles and aunties.

38:07.452 --> 38:08.869
What about the house
where I found him?

38:09.037 --> 38:13.791
Uh, it's rented to
a... a Raymond Martin.

38:15.001 --> 38:15.960
That's him.

38:16.127 --> 38:19.046
No outstanding warrants.
Looks like he's layin' low...

38:21.925 --> 38:23.092
Has he got any priors?

38:27.764 --> 38:33.018
Ah. Did eight years in
Statesville. Felony arson.

38:42.737 --> 38:43.696
Cute enough?

38:43.863 --> 38:46.490
It's perfect. I love it.
Even the view is better.

38:47.784 --> 38:50.160
Uh...
Oh, God!

38:56.501 --> 38:57.626
Who you got here?

38:57.794 --> 39:03.424
Oh... That is my niece,
Maria. She just started
ballet classes.

39:03.591 --> 39:08.262
She's so adorable. The one
next to her, that's Antonio's
brainiac son, Diego.

39:08.430 --> 39:12.099
I don't know where he gets it.
The twins, Freddy and Carla.

39:14.269 --> 39:16.103
You his aunt, too?

39:17.689 --> 39:19.523
Yeah,
we hang out sometimes.
Oh, yeah?

39:19.691 --> 39:21.859
Well, he knows all the best
dive restaurants in the city.

39:22.527 --> 39:23.777
Really?
Mmm-hmm.

39:24.487 --> 39:28.699
Here, try this. It's a
little spicy. Be careful.

39:28.867 --> 39:30.159
I can take it.

39:35.248 --> 39:36.915
Oh, my God.
Yeah? You like it?

39:37.083 --> 39:38.083
It is phenomenal.

39:41.046 --> 39:44.048
Hey! Let's take a picture
for your wall of fame.
Okay.

39:45.300 --> 39:48.218
Nah. Here. Ready?

39:48.386 --> 39:49.803
Ready.
You sure?

39:49.971 --> 39:53.682
Yeah.
Three, two, one...

40:17.165 --> 40:20.084
I gotta go...
Okay. What's up?

40:22.796 --> 40:24.046
Vargas.

40:27.759 --> 40:29.134
Vargas,
you gotta stop playin'.

40:33.098 --> 40:34.807
Come on, man.

40:38.895 --> 40:42.064
Hey there, buddy.
What's going on?

40:43.233 --> 40:45.150
This is so messed up.

40:49.322 --> 40:51.573
Why don't you move away from
the edge there, Vargas?

40:51.741 --> 40:55.285
I've been telling him. If he
keeps living the rest of his
life the way he fought fires,

40:55.453 --> 40:57.955
he'll have a hell of
a lot to be proud of.

41:06.881 --> 41:09.550
You remember the Homewood
fire? We lost a house,
and Vargas

41:09.717 --> 41:11.135
saves the family photo album?

41:12.679 --> 41:14.721
Now, here's the thing.
I never told you.

41:15.348 --> 41:17.266
The mom thanked me
after it was all over.

41:17.851 --> 41:21.311
You know what she said?
She said, "The house was
made out of wood.

41:21.980 --> 41:24.356
"But the home was made out
of the people in that book."

41:25.024 --> 41:30.112
Firehouse 51 is made out of
you, and me, and Severide...

41:32.031 --> 41:34.533
And every firefighter who's
passed through those gates.

41:36.828 --> 41:38.871
Nothing can take that
away from you.

41:59.017 --> 42:02.394
51 is always gonna
be your house.

42:06.858 --> 42:07.858
Okay.
