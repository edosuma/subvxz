00:54.870 --> 00:57.710
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

00:58.190 --> 01:00.990
<i>(voice-mail) Hi, you've reached the
office of Dr. Stuart Price.</i>

01:01.030 --> 01:03.070
<i>Please note the office will be closed
until the 24th.</i>

01:03.070 --> 01:05.390

please try...</i>

01:07.350 --> 01:09.790
<i>(phone ringing)</i>

01:10.030 --> 01:13.190
<i>(voice-mail) Hi! This is Dr. Stu Price.
I'm getting married.</i>

01:13.190 --> 01:14.910
<i>So I'll be out of the
country for 2 weeks.</i>

01:14.910 --> 01:16.990
<i>I'm not sure if I'll
have cell service.</i>

01:16.990 --> 01:19.430
<i>If this is a dental emergency...</i>

01:19.430 --> 01:21.350
Nothing.

01:21.390 --> 01:26.150
<i>(speaking in Thai)</i>

01:26.830 --> 01:29.110
Daddy, please! You're not helping!

01:29.110 --> 01:33.070
I looked into his eyes.
Not the eyes of a man.

01:33.070 --> 01:35.510
The eyes of a coward.

01:35.550 --> 01:39.150
<i>(speaking in Thai again)</i>

01:39.310 --> 01:41.070
Excuse me!

01:45.310 --> 01:46.990
- Bill!
- Tracy!

01:46.990 --> 01:50.510
- I'm sorry!
- Where the hell are you?

01:52.910 --> 01:55.070
It happened again!

01:55.070 --> 01:57.710
Don't say that, please!

01:57.710 --> 02:00.150
No this time we really fucked up.

02:00.150 --> 02:02.910
Seriously! What is wrong with you three?

02:02.910 --> 02:05.950
So much Trace, I don't even know
where to begin.

02:05.950 --> 02:08.470
<i>Oh god! How bad?</i>

02:08.470 --> 02:12.990
- Like, no wedding bad?
- Yeah...

02:12.990 --> 02:15.590
a little worse than that.

02:18.430 --> 02:22.310
THE HANGOVER PART II

03:53.270 --> 03:55.350
ONE WEEK EARLIER

03:55.550 --> 03:56.990
Uh, huh.

03:58.630 --> 04:02.910
- You really need to floss more.
- Fuck that! That's why I come here.

04:03.030 --> 04:07.110
- Then you should come more than once every two years!
- Why? So you can bleed me of all my money?

04:07.070 --> 04:09.630
I never charge you a dime, Phil!

04:09.830 --> 04:12.630
- Hey, how do I work the nitrous?
- Ah, you don't actually.

04:12.630 --> 04:15.230
Come on! Just one hit!

04:15.230 --> 04:18.790
Fillings look pretty good. Any other problems?

04:18.790 --> 04:22.950
Yeah, actually. You're getting married
in Thailand.

04:22.950 --> 04:26.630
For starters, that's flights for me and Steph.
That's two grand right there.

04:26.630 --> 04:30.590
Then my mother in laws watching the kids. So
now she's got this whole new thing over my head.

04:30.590 --> 04:32.630
Plus, takes five days to get there.

04:32.630 --> 04:36.110
It's a 16 hour flight. And it's beautiful
when you get there.

04:36.110 --> 04:38.510
- Whatever, it's a hassle!
- It is kinda far.

04:38.510 --> 04:40.950
Lauren's been there a week and she's
still jet lagged.

04:40.950 --> 04:43.550
But it's where her parents are from and
it means a lot to them.

04:43.550 --> 04:46.870
Who gives a shit about her parents!
Her dad hates you!

04:46.870 --> 04:50.470
He doesn't hate me! He's just never
spoken to me...

04:50.470 --> 04:52.030
...I think it's a cultural thing.

04:52.070 --> 04:54.790
Why can't you just get married in Vegas like
you did the last time. It's so much easier.

04:54.830 --> 04:57.550
Why can't you just be excited for me?

04:57.590 --> 04:59.830
This is my wedding!

05:04.470 --> 05:08.350
- You're really happy, huh?
- I really am.

05:11.390 --> 05:12.630
Alright...

05:12.630 --> 05:15.270
...I'm happy too.

05:15.270 --> 05:18.950
- Thank you!
- Gonna be fun.

05:20.950 --> 05:24.270
Phil. Put the prescription pad back.

05:38.070 --> 05:42.390
- Thank you. You know that's a felony right?
- Fuck you, man!

05:42.950 --> 05:46.550
- Was this right up against your scrotum?
- Yep.

05:48.430 --> 05:50.430
- Oh my god, I just realized.
- What?

05:50.430 --> 05:53.550
- I forgot to renew my passport!
- Oh no...

05:53.550 --> 05:56.550
Good thing I did it last week. It's in
the kitchen drawer.

05:57.510 --> 06:00.710
- You're the best!
- Hey! We're a team!

06:00.710 --> 06:05.150
You're a good guy. Like a really good guy!

06:06.350 --> 06:07.630
Thank you!

06:07.630 --> 06:11.870
- So I know you're not gonna get mad.
- Mad? What, mad at what?

06:11.870 --> 06:15.310
Alan found out that we're going to
Thailand for Stu's wedding.

06:15.310 --> 06:18.790
- So?
- So he's heart broken Doug. You guys are like his family!

06:18.790 --> 06:21.710
No. Your family is like his family.

06:21.710 --> 06:24.750
All Alan talks about is the three of you.

06:24.750 --> 06:26.750
- And that weekend.
- Wait a second...

06:26.750 --> 06:31.070
- Is he the one who keeps calling and hanging up?
- He does that when he's upset.

06:31.070 --> 06:33.630
He doesn't understand why he's not invited.

06:33.630 --> 06:38.150
Could you just run it by Stu? Just run it by him.

06:38.150 --> 06:40.230
For me...

06:41.950 --> 06:44.310
No fucking way! Absolutely not!

06:44.310 --> 06:47.230
Come on Stu, it's killing him.

06:47.230 --> 06:51.110
Honestly, the two of you were barely invited.

06:51.110 --> 06:53.910
I get it. I really do. It's just, you know what...

06:53.910 --> 06:56.070
Alan considers you to be one of his best friends.

06:56.070 --> 06:57.910
I consider Alan to be insane.

06:57.910 --> 07:01.270
Stu, throw him a bone! We've already said he's got to
pay for everything he eats and everything he breaks.

07:01.270 --> 07:04.310
You know what. We should see if we can squeeze
the old man to cover the bachelor party.

07:04.310 --> 07:06.390
- That's good.
- I'm glad you brought that up.

07:06.390 --> 07:10.790
- Because... this is the bachelor party!
- What?

07:10.790 --> 07:13.870
- What are you talking about?
- Yeah, it's my bachelor brunch!

07:13.870 --> 07:19.030
Go crazy. Get some chocolate chip pancakes... a
lap dance from the waitress...

07:19.030 --> 07:23.670
That's bullshit! You can't just skip
out of a bachelor party, Stu.

07:23.670 --> 07:27.350
You see that? That's orange juice with
a napkin on top.

07:27.350 --> 07:30.030
Do you know why? So nobody will refuse me.

07:30.030 --> 07:32.870
Why I refuse to eat fucking cantaloupe
at a bachelor party?

07:32.870 --> 07:36.710
- C'mon Stu. Don't you think you're over reacting?
- No, I don't.

07:37.390 --> 07:42.310
I'm still putting the pieces of my broken
psyche back together.

07:42.630 --> 07:47.950
And you know what the glue is? Lauren!
I'm not doing anything to screw that up.

07:47.950 --> 07:51.110
- Oh, please. You wouldn't even be with her if it wasn't for us.
- Oh, this'll be good.

07:51.110 --> 07:52.750
Stu, think about it!

07:52.750 --> 07:55.790
You ended up ditching Melissa, and two years later
you met your true soul mate.

07:55.790 --> 07:58.990
You take Vegas out of that equation, you
would have married a cunt.

08:00.750 --> 08:02.990
Oh that's ok. I'm allowed to say it. It's
a bachelor party.

08:02.990 --> 08:04.510
Drink up everybody.

08:04.510 --> 08:07.390
Oh wait, there's no alcohol! I forgot
we're at a fuckin IHOP!

08:07.390 --> 08:10.550
Well it's my decision and it's final, so...
how bout a toast?

08:10.550 --> 08:12.910
This sucks. I'm gonna wait in the car.

08:12.910 --> 08:15.390
- C'mon Phil, where you going?
- Doug, Doug, I just don't get it!

08:15.390 --> 08:18.390
He's getting married in Thailand! That's
great for him, but what about us?

08:18.390 --> 08:21.950
You're selfish! Come on, sweetheart...

08:22.790 --> 08:24.750
Shame on you!

08:27.110 --> 08:29.910
Don't worry Stu. I will stand up for you
no matter what.

08:29.910 --> 08:31.110
Thank you.

08:31.150 --> 08:34.390
But you gotta help me out with this Alan thing.

08:36.230 --> 08:38.669
Guys, I can't tell you how much this means...

08:38.669 --> 08:42.110
Alan's been waiting for the invite ever
since he got word of the wedding.

08:42.110 --> 08:43.470
- I'm sure he has.
- Yeah.

08:43.470 --> 08:46.590
Been standing outside by the mailbox every day.

08:46.590 --> 08:48.110
- Well that's tough.
- Yeah.

08:49.110 --> 08:52.590
I uh, I'm not sure he ever left Vegas.

08:52.790 --> 08:54.910
He really needs this.

08:56.030 --> 08:57.310
What?

08:57.830 --> 09:01.830
Sweetie, papa! You have visitors!
Go in slowly.

09:01.830 --> 09:04.550
Give him a chance to acclimate.

09:06.990 --> 09:11.310
- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys! Hey, Phil!

09:11.310 --> 09:13.150
Hey, bud!

09:14.710 --> 09:18.110
- You guys wanna come in?
- Sure. Absolutely.

09:21.110 --> 09:22.350
- Hey.
- Hey.

09:23.350 --> 09:26.790
- Hey, Stu!
- Ok. See you on the court in half...

09:28.670 --> 09:32.670
- Pretty cool room, Alan!
- Thanks, Phil! My dad pays my rent.

09:32.670 --> 09:36.310
Alan, what the fuck! You were supposed
to delete these!

09:36.310 --> 09:38.150
You made a promise!

09:38.190 --> 09:39.310
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:39.630 --> 09:43.750
What the hell? I'm not cool with this
at all. You can't have these.

09:44.550 --> 09:46.550
Relax, Stu! Nobody ever comes in here.

09:46.550 --> 09:50.950
- A total violation of trust!
- Mother I'm done with my lunch. It's just sitting here!

09:51.790 --> 09:53.710
<i>I'm sorry, honey. I'll be right up.</i>

09:53.710 --> 09:56.630
- I can't believe you guys stopped by. This is really cool.
- Wait a second!

09:56.630 --> 10:00.110
- Al, is that Mr. Chow?
- Yeah. We still keep in touch.

10:00.110 --> 10:01.150
Stu!

10:01.150 --> 10:03.550
Chow, the guy that kidnapped us?

10:03.630 --> 10:05.470
He didn't kidnap us. He kidnapped Black Doug.

10:05.550 --> 10:06.990
Remember? It was a whole big misunderstanding.

10:07.470 --> 10:09.390
He's actually quite charming.

10:09.390 --> 10:12.430
- Alan, he's a criminal.
- Excuse me, boys!

10:12.430 --> 10:14.230
- Hi, Linda!
- Hi, Dougie!

10:14.230 --> 10:16.550
I guess we don't do desert anymore. I
didn't get that memo.

10:16.550 --> 10:19.550
I'm sorry, darling. I'll be right back.

10:19.550 --> 10:21.950
Would a cupcake kill you?

10:21.950 --> 10:25.950
- You know, I don't think this was a good idea.
- Alan, we have a little surprise for you.

10:25.950 --> 10:28.910
Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.

10:28.910 --> 10:32.710
- Well only if you're not busy.
- Stu!

10:32.710 --> 10:35.190
Well maybe the Jonas Brothers are in town.

10:35.190 --> 10:37.950
Nope. They're in Raleigh-Durham that weekend.

10:39.230 --> 10:43.990
Are you really being serious, Stu?
You're inviting me?

10:46.990 --> 10:51.030
Yeah why not? It's gonna be fun, right?

10:52.110 --> 10:54.430
- Phil, are you going?
- Of course!

10:55.630 --> 10:58.270
Then it will be fun.

11:04.430 --> 11:06.630
What the fuck are you doing, man?

11:07.550 --> 11:11.230
It's my immunizations. It's the last day
I can do it.

11:11.230 --> 11:13.510
That's supposed to be done by a registered nurse.

11:13.510 --> 11:16.150
I'm a nurse. Just not registered.

11:16.150 --> 11:20.630
Stu, look at this!
I bought this cause I thought of you!

11:55.270 --> 11:57.670
- Hey, there he is!
- Hey, Stu!

11:57.670 --> 12:00.910
- Teddy! What's up? How are ya?
- Hey Stu.

12:02.070 --> 12:05.270
- Alright. Who's this guy, Stu?
- This is Teddy. Lauren's little brother.

12:05.270 --> 12:08.190
Goes to Stanford. Pre-med. This is
Phil, Alan and Doug.

12:08.190 --> 12:09.550
Hey, nice to meet you, man!

12:09.550 --> 12:11.710
Wow, Stanford? How old are you?

12:11.710 --> 12:16.070
- He's 17. Kind of a genius.
- Actually, I'm 16.

12:16.070 --> 12:19.470
I'm not a genius. My dad just had me take
the entrance exams early.

12:19.470 --> 12:21.750
Because you're a genius.

12:21.750 --> 12:24.870
- So what are you, a doctor?
- No, not yet. I'm premed.

12:24.870 --> 12:28.230
- Ever heard of that guy Doogie Howser?
- Yeah.

12:28.230 --> 12:31.590
- Well, he turned out to be a gay.
- Alan.

12:31.590 --> 12:33.550
It's true, I read it in Teen People.

12:33.550 --> 12:37.870
Right, ok... well I'm gonna grab a book or something
for the plane. You guys want anything?

12:37.870 --> 12:41.110
- No, thanks. I'm good.
- I would actually love a small water.

12:41.110 --> 12:42.470
Cool.

12:44.510 --> 12:47.390
- What's the matter with you. He's 16 years old.
- Yeah, Alan. Take it easy!

12:47.390 --> 12:51.470
I'm a little confused. Is he here just to
see us off or what. How does this work?

12:51.470 --> 12:55.070
- How does what work?
- Is that person coming to the wedding?

12:55.070 --> 13:00.630
Yes Alan. My brides little brother is
coming to the wedding. Is that ok with you?

13:00.630 --> 13:04.110
Well, it's the first time I've heard of it.
You could have paged me.

13:07.430 --> 13:10.830
Don't over react. It's gonna be fine.

13:12.670 --> 13:17.230
- Hey. Mind if I sit?
- Wolf pack only. Find another chair.

13:17.230 --> 13:21.230
- There's no wolfpack, Alan. C'mon.
- It's no problem. I'll find...

13:21.230 --> 13:24.550
- Teddy, don't be ridiculous! You're sitting here!
- Careful, that's a Louis...

13:24.550 --> 13:27.510
That is a Louis Vuitton!

13:35.790 --> 13:41.750
- That's a nice neck roll!
- Thanks! You can use it if you want.

13:41.750 --> 13:43.350
Ok.

13:46.550 --> 13:51.310
<i>The Downeaster 'Alexa'" by Billy Joel playing</i>

14:49.950 --> 14:51.590
Baby!

15:05.150 --> 15:09.510
This is so absolutely beautiful!
Thank you much!

15:09.510 --> 15:10.830
Of course.

15:10.830 --> 15:15.590
Between Teddy and me, you must be pretty excited.
Pretty soon you'll have 2 doctors in the family.

15:15.590 --> 15:20.070
You have to realize that in my country we
don't consider dentists to be real doctors.

15:20.070 --> 15:21.110
Dad...

15:21.670 --> 15:22.710
Ok.

15:22.710 --> 15:26.630
Anyway I have to go and talk to Teddy
about his cello performance tonight.

15:28.350 --> 15:29.510
Ouch!

15:29.550 --> 15:31.190
I'm so sorry...

15:31.190 --> 15:33.870
Your dad's kind of obsessed with your
brother, isn't he?

15:33.870 --> 15:37.470
Teddy is my dad's prize possession. It's
always been that way.

15:38.270 --> 15:41.470
He'll warm up, I promise! Okay?

15:41.550 --> 15:43.550
You can just fax it over to me. I'll
pick it up at the concierge.

15:45.150 --> 15:47.510
Thanks, papa! Bye bye!

15:47.510 --> 15:50.510
That was my dad. I'm a stay at home son.

15:50.510 --> 15:54.070
We were discussing your wedding gift.
He's sparing no expense.

15:54.750 --> 15:56.710
Oh... That's so unnecessary.

15:56.710 --> 15:59.550
I've been meaning to ask someone. I
notice this is a fishing village.

15:59.550 --> 16:01.550
Is there a Long John Silver's on
the island?

16:01.550 --> 16:04.470
You know. No, I don't think so. I'm so sorry.

16:04.470 --> 16:08.310
But, we are actually serving some
great fresh seafood.

16:08.310 --> 16:10.910
- Better than Long John's?
- Yes.

16:10.910 --> 16:14.030
- I'll be the judge of that. Enjoy your evening.
- You too. Ok.

16:49.950 --> 16:51.870
All right!

16:57.990 --> 16:59.830
Thank you, Teddy!

16:59.830 --> 17:02.870
The hands of a brilliant musician!

17:02.870 --> 17:05.510
And one day, a great surgeon.

17:07.349 --> 17:09.630
I admit it...

17:09.630 --> 17:13.510
When I first met Stu, I was not quite sold.

17:14.630 --> 17:20.829
He seemed unattractive. He lacked
intelligence and imagination.

17:20.829 --> 17:25.270
He was missing the spark you look for
in a man.

17:26.270 --> 17:29.310
But then I looked into Stu's eyes.

17:29.310 --> 17:33.870
It reminded me of my sweet brother,
Chai Yo.

17:33.870 --> 17:38.870
For those who do not know, Chai Yo is learning
the sailboat and lives in a group home.

17:41.790 --> 17:45.070
But Chai Yo loves "khao" .

17:45.070 --> 17:51.750
And that's when I realized, Stu is "khao".

17:51.750 --> 17:53.430
What is "khao"?

17:53.430 --> 17:57.310
"Khao" is soft white rice in luke warm water.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.590
It has no taste.

17:59.590 --> 18:04.670
We feed it to small baby and uh, very
old people.

18:04.670 --> 18:07.910
It is nourishment that everyone can digest.

18:07.910 --> 18:14.870
The world needs "khao", just as the
world needs people like Stu.

18:16.230 --> 18:20.070
To my sweet daughter and Stu!
Congratulations!

18:20.070 --> 18:21.550
Cheers!

18:24.950 --> 18:28.950
And now I believe that Teddy has
something to say.

18:29.830 --> 18:33.990
Sit down! I got this.
Sit down, boy!

18:34.830 --> 18:37.470
That was a.. a great speech, sir!

18:37.470 --> 18:42.990
I like the comparison between
Stu and rice.

18:43.990 --> 18:47.510
I've also prepared a few words.

18:47.510 --> 18:50.270
Hey everybody. Here's some fun facts.

18:50.270 --> 18:53.750
The population in Thailand is 63 million people.

18:53.750 --> 18:56.390
It is twice the size of Wyoming.

18:56.390 --> 19:00.150
It's chief exports are textiles, footwear
and rice.

19:00.150 --> 19:05.990
Each year approximately 13,000 people are
killed in car accidents in Thailand.

19:05.990 --> 19:07.950
- The climate in Thailand...
- Alan!

19:07.950 --> 19:12.790
- Why don't you skip to the last card there, buddy.
- Okay. Sorry!

19:15.750 --> 19:18.470
None of you know Stu like I do.

19:18.470 --> 19:24.070
Not you... not you... not you...

19:24.070 --> 19:27.790
Not nobody knows Stu like I do.

19:28.750 --> 19:30.830
No one!

19:30.830 --> 19:34.470
I can't even tell you what we've been
through cause we made a pact.

19:34.470 --> 19:36.830
More important than blood.

19:36.830 --> 19:41.870
What I can tell you is this. This is
not Stu's first marriage.

19:41.870 --> 19:45.110
There was a whore in Las Vegas
a couple of years ago.

19:45.110 --> 19:46.950
Sit down...

19:49.030 --> 19:53.590
- Enough! He'll get over it!
- Okay. Thanks, Phil!

20:01.950 --> 20:04.030
In your face!

20:06.910 --> 20:10.470
Well that was exactly as painful as I
expected it to be.

20:10.470 --> 20:11.910
Sorry...

20:13.470 --> 20:16.790
- Oh, rice pudding! What are you doing?
- HaHa. Very funny!

20:16.790 --> 20:19.230
Be nice, Phil! He's extra sensitive tonight.

20:19.230 --> 20:22.390
Get over it! He's your father in law. He's
supposed to hate you.

20:22.630 --> 20:24.950
Come have a drink with me and the guys.

20:24.950 --> 20:29.590
You know... I'm really exhausted. We're
just gonna go upstairs and crash.

20:29.590 --> 20:32.830
C'mon, I just spoke with the manager. He's
gonna let us have a bonfire on the beach.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.590
That sounds fun!

20:36.590 --> 20:38.750
- Nyah... I'm good.
- He's tired!

20:38.750 --> 20:41.790
Stu, one drink with your friends who
came all this way.

20:41.790 --> 20:44.870
- I just wanna hang out with you!
- Oh c'mon. Just go! And do me a favor.

20:44.870 --> 20:49.030
Take Teddy with you. He never gets to
have any fun.

20:49.030 --> 20:51.550
That is a great idea. Bring the kid.

20:51.550 --> 20:54.350
- Alright. One drink!
- Perfect.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.270
- See you later.
- Have fun!

20:56.270 --> 20:59.310
- You have the key?
- Yep, got it right here!

20:59.310 --> 21:01.710
I'll see you in 20 minutes!

21:04.270 --> 21:07.830
My uncle Roger said that he once saw
an albino polar bear.

21:07.830 --> 21:12.470
Really? Polar bears are white.
How would he know if it's an albino?

21:13.870 --> 21:16.510
This one was black.

21:17.990 --> 21:21.550
Did you ever think maybe it was
just a black bear?

21:24.270 --> 21:25.910
Whatever...

21:26.150 --> 21:30.230
Ok. Here we go. American beer.

21:30.230 --> 21:33.310
- Sealed bottle!
- Thank you. Alright!

21:34.750 --> 21:37.910
- I'm not really old enough to drink.
- Yeah, it's illegal.

21:37.910 --> 21:40.310
Would be a shame if somebody reported you.

21:40.310 --> 21:44.510
Nobody's reporting anybody.
It's fine Teddy. Have a little fun.

21:44.510 --> 21:45.870
Careful!

21:45.870 --> 21:49.790
What is this? Instant marshmallows?
Nice touch!

21:49.790 --> 21:52.870
- That was Alan's idea.
- Good thinking, Al!

21:53.870 --> 21:58.470
You know... I gotta hand it to you, Stu!
This place is paradise.

21:58.470 --> 21:59.710
Not bad, right?

21:59.710 --> 22:04.270
And I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I'm actually jealous of you.

22:04.270 --> 22:07.670
- I mean, Lauren is an angel.
- Yeah, she really is amazing.

22:07.750 --> 22:09.110
Wow, you guys are sweet.

22:09.310 --> 22:14.310
Not big breasts on her. But still, solid
rack for an Asian.

22:14.310 --> 22:17.230
- Sorry, Teddy, but it's true.
- That's ok.

22:17.230 --> 22:19.390
That is just wildly inappropriate.

22:19.390 --> 22:26.310
And yet... I'm really glad you're here.
All you guys. Even you Alan.

22:26.310 --> 22:29.550
It means a lot that you made the trip.
Thank you.

22:29.550 --> 22:32.110
- Wouldn't have missed it buddy.
- Great!

22:32.110 --> 22:35.470
Now. Can we have our one fucking beer, dad?

22:36.830 --> 22:39.630
Alright. Toast! C'mon stand up guys.

22:40.630 --> 22:42.070
Come over here, Alan!

22:43.710 --> 22:46.230
To Lauren and Stu!

22:46.230 --> 22:49.070
- You did it, buddy.
- Sure did.

22:49.750 --> 22:51.190
Cheers!

24:04.750 --> 24:07.310
What the hell...

24:44.270 --> 24:45.430
What?

25:10.150 --> 25:11.670
Phil...

25:12.590 --> 25:15.310
I think it happened again.

25:15.310 --> 25:20.310
- Alan, what the fuck did you do?
- I didn't do anything. I swear to god.

25:20.310 --> 25:23.670
Your hair is gone.

25:23.670 --> 25:28.150
No, no... up.

25:33.710 --> 25:36.710
Where the fuck are we?

25:43.870 --> 25:45.710
Phil, I'm scared.

25:56.510 --> 25:59.510
Stu, c'mon get up! We got a situation.

26:07.670 --> 26:11.790
- Oh, holy shit!
- Where are we?

26:13.830 --> 26:19.310
- Oh my god, Alan. Your head.
- No your head!

26:19.310 --> 26:23.350
- Is it bald?
- Stu, you're gonna freak out, but it's gonna be ok.

26:23.350 --> 26:27.110
- Why? Was it my teeth?
- Nope, it's not your teeth.

26:27.110 --> 26:28.630
- Are you sure?
- Yep.

26:28.630 --> 26:30.390
Can you see the bottom?

26:32.950 --> 26:38.030
Oh my god! What the fu...ck

26:39.270 --> 26:42.230
That's good. Why don't you try to wash it off.

26:42.230 --> 26:47.590
It's not coming off. This is a real tattoo!

26:47.590 --> 26:50.790
- Alan, what did you do! Did you Roofie me?
- I didn't do anything!

26:50.790 --> 26:53.190
Stu, he swore to god!

26:54.550 --> 26:56.030
What happened?

26:59.270 --> 27:02.350
Get it off of me!

27:04.550 --> 27:07.430
- What the hell?
- It's a monkey.

27:07.430 --> 27:11.030
What a cute little mask. Hi little monkey.

27:10.990 --> 27:12.430
Alan...

27:15.830 --> 27:19.310
Phone! Alan, go find the phone!

27:20.190 --> 27:21.590
I got it!

27:22.630 --> 27:25.750
- Doug, where the hell are you?
- I'm at breakfast. By the pool.

27:25.750 --> 27:29.830
- You guys coming down or what?
- Oh Jesus. Thank god. Doug's fine.

27:29.830 --> 27:33.870
- Stu, Doug's fine. He's at the resort.
- Why aren't we at the resort.

27:33.870 --> 27:35.430
What's going on? Where are you guys?

27:35.430 --> 27:39.350
I do not know, man! We woke up
in some shit hole room in some city.

27:39.350 --> 27:42.870
- Oh god. What city?
- I don't know, Doug!

27:42.870 --> 27:45.510
Fuckin Asia-town.

27:45.510 --> 27:48.550
<i>- I do not know, I told you.
- Where are we?</i>

27:53.550 --> 27:56.310
- Hey Stu.
- What?

27:56.310 --> 27:58.790
Check this out.

27:58.790 --> 28:02.390
Ever seen anything like this?

28:08.550 --> 28:12.350
- What is that?
- Careful. Might be a spiders nest.

28:12.350 --> 28:14.870
I've tangled with those before.

28:14.870 --> 28:19.870
I don't get it man. We each had one beer
last night, right? I mean you too!

28:19.870 --> 28:23.390
- Yeah but I left early, remember?
- I don't remember shit!

28:23.390 --> 28:26.310
Tracy wasn't feeling well. She came
down to get me.

28:26.310 --> 28:30.350
- Wait and second. Is Teddy with you guys?
- Teddy? What? What are you talking about?

28:30.350 --> 28:33.030
He wasn't in his room. They've been
looking for him all morning.

28:33.030 --> 28:35.910
- Teddy went to Stanford, right?
- Yeah. Why?

28:35.910 --> 28:37.750
Fuck!

28:39.350 --> 28:42.230
- I just found his finger!
- What?

28:42.910 --> 28:47.630
- I just found his fucking finger, Doug!
- Phil, what is going on?

28:48.070 --> 28:51.830
Alright. Alright, alright... this is
what we're gonna do.

28:51.830 --> 28:55.030
You tell the girls that we woke up early and went
on a fishing trip, ok. And that's where we are.

28:55.030 --> 28:58.070
- Right.
- Right, stay by the phone!

28:59.110 --> 29:01.110
Shit!

29:03.710 --> 29:06.550
Uh, we got a little bit of a problem.

29:07.350 --> 29:09.270
What is that?

29:09.790 --> 29:11.630
We don't know.

29:12.310 --> 29:16.670
- Is it a worm?
- It's a mushroom.

29:17.910 --> 29:20.070
Yeah, shiitake.

29:20.590 --> 29:23.590
Monkey, taste it! Is it shiitake?

29:23.590 --> 29:27.990
- He can't understand you.
- He just did.

29:27.990 --> 29:31.270
- Why is he pulling on it?
- He's probably hungry.

29:31.270 --> 29:33.750
Wait a second. Is that...

29:33.750 --> 29:38.590
What the fuck man. Tell that gay monkey
to leave my shit alone.

29:38.590 --> 29:39.910
Chow?

29:39.910 --> 29:42.790
You're fucking crazy.

29:42.790 --> 29:48.510
It's so fucking light in here!
Alan, grab me my sunglasses!

29:48.510 --> 29:53.390
- It's great to see you, Leslie!
- Nice to see you too my little popo.

29:53.390 --> 29:55.310
Chow, what the fuck are you doing here?

29:55.310 --> 29:58.790
Alan called me a few days ago and
invited me to the wedding.

29:58.790 --> 30:00.990
- Excuse me?
- What, he's my plus one.

30:00.990 --> 30:03.590
You don't have plus one. It's $200 a plate.

30:03.590 --> 30:06.630
Guys, guys. Just focus, ok.
Chow, what happened?

30:06.630 --> 30:11.110
You guys texted me, said you're fucked
up and looking to party.

30:16.990 --> 30:20.190
I picked you up on my boat and I brought
you here to Bangkok.

30:20.190 --> 30:22.790
But we had a sick night, bitches!

30:22.790 --> 30:27.710
Wait a second Chow,  we're in Bangkok?

30:27.710 --> 30:30.910
Holler, city of squalor.

30:30.910 --> 30:35.590
- Do you know how I got this tattoo?
- Uh, yeah from a fucking tattoo guy!

30:35.590 --> 30:38.630
Come on Stu, use that big Jewish brain.

30:38.630 --> 30:40.630
What's the monkey holding?

30:43.030 --> 30:46.990
- That's a finger!
- Stu, I got some bad news.

30:46.990 --> 30:51.430
Teddy was with us last night.
That's his finger.

30:52.710 --> 30:57.910
- Teddy's dead?
- Teddy's not dead! He partied with us all night!

30:57.910 --> 31:01.550
- Well then where is he?
- Don't you remember anything?

31:01.550 --> 31:04.830
- No!
- No, nothing, Chow.

31:04.830 --> 31:07.910
Ok I explain it all, ok?

31:07.910 --> 31:12.750
Just let me do one bump, get my head straight.
Come to papa.

31:12.750 --> 31:15.150
That's a big...

31:20.150 --> 31:24.230
You ready for craziest fucking story ever...

31:33.550 --> 31:35.030
Chow!

31:36.870 --> 31:40.070
Hey Chow, you okay?

31:41.350 --> 31:44.230
You gotta be kidding me.

31:49.110 --> 31:51.630
Fuck, he's dead!

31:56.990 --> 31:58.270
- Help!
- Stu!

31:59.030 --> 32:02.190
- Help!
- Stu, shut up!

32:02.190 --> 32:04.990
- Call an ambulance!
- Shut up! He's dead!

32:04.990 --> 32:07.790
Look if someone comes and finds a dead
body and a pile of cocaine...

32:07.790 --> 32:11.190
We're gonna spend the rest of our fucking
lives in a Thai prison.

32:11.830 --> 32:14.470
Alan! Please don't cry!

32:15.790 --> 32:20.550
Alright. Alright. I just need a second to
figure this out.

32:35.590 --> 32:38.110
ICE MACHINE LOCATED ON 15TH FLOOR.

32:52.750 --> 32:54.790
Look, this is the worst idea, ever.

32:54.790 --> 32:56.590
What the fuck is this place?

32:56.590 --> 33:00.230
Bangkok is the capital of Thailand. Its
population is 12 million people...

33:00.230 --> 33:02.870
Alan, will you help!

33:08.430 --> 33:11.750
- The elevator!
- I'll get the button!

33:14.470 --> 33:18.190
- What the fuck is the deal with this monkey?
- That monkey gets it!

33:19.590 --> 33:21.150
- Come on!
- Fuck no!

33:21.150 --> 33:24.070
The powers out. We gotta take the stairs.

33:24.070 --> 33:25.430
- Oh fuck!
- Come on!

33:30.790 --> 33:32.430
Here it is!

33:32.910 --> 33:36.270
Feet first. I've done this before.

33:41.430 --> 33:43.350
Careful!

34:01.990 --> 34:04.550
- Stu!
- What?

34:06.510 --> 34:10.230
- We still have to find Teddy!
- Oh god.

34:18.110 --> 34:19.710
The roof!

34:19.710 --> 34:23.670
Teddy!

34:30.790 --> 34:33.750
- You guys see him?
- No!

34:42.270 --> 34:43.909
He's not here.

34:45.989 --> 34:49.510
I can't believe this is happening again.

34:51.590 --> 34:55.670
Ok, look. We'll handle this. You get
back there.

34:55.670 --> 34:59.110
You tell them that Alan and I got drunk
with him, we're still partying.

34:59.110 --> 35:04.070
- You gotta go get married!
- No! Not going back without Teddy!

35:04.070 --> 35:06.990
He's Lauren's little brother. He's lost,
he's injured.

35:08.590 --> 35:14.350
If I fuck this up, I lose everything.

35:15.790 --> 35:17.230
Ok.

35:18.270 --> 35:19.750
Alright.

35:21.110 --> 35:23.950
- Alan, check your pockets!
- What?

35:23.950 --> 35:26.750
You know the drill. C'mon there might
be clues.

35:26.750 --> 35:30.470
- Check your phones! Numbers, texts.
- That's a good idea!

35:31.190 --> 35:34.430
- I got nothing. Fuck!
- I got an text from Chow.

35:34.430 --> 35:37.150
- What time?
- Uh, 10 o'clock last night.

35:37.150 --> 35:41.270
- What's it say?
- "On my way, Niggahs"

35:41.270 --> 35:44.390
Oh, Niggahs... ok... hip hop.

35:46.750 --> 35:51.070
We are so... fucked!

35:51.070 --> 35:56.150
Hey Phil! Look who's back!

35:57.550 --> 36:01.350
We gotta get you out of the sun. You're
too hot.

36:02.830 --> 36:05.550
Phil, I really think we should go to
the American Consulate.

36:05.550 --> 36:08.870
For what? To report a dead body we shoved
into an ice machine?

36:08.870 --> 36:12.030
What are we gonna do? Keep walking around
in circles? Cause that's real productive.

36:12.030 --> 36:14.550
You know I'm trying to figure this thing
out here and your attitude is not helping.

36:14.550 --> 36:17.630
I'm sorry. It's a 100 degrees and we
don't have a plan.

36:17.630 --> 36:19.910
And all we've done is buy him hats and sodas.

36:19.910 --> 36:22.630
-What, it's a bag of Fanta!
- Alright, what do you want to do, Stu?

36:22.630 --> 36:23.670
I don't know!

36:23.670 --> 36:25.630
Well then stop yelling at me like it's my fuckin fault.

36:25.630 --> 36:27.150
It is your fault!

36:27.150 --> 36:29.470
All I wanted was a bachelor brunch.

36:29.470 --> 36:31.670
Shit! Shut up! It's Doug! Talk to me!

36:31.670 --> 36:35.150
I just got off the phone with Bangkok PD.
They've got him. He's ok.

36:35.150 --> 36:38.230
Oh thank god! Doug found him.

36:38.230 --> 36:39.990
- What happened?
- He got arrested.

36:39.990 --> 36:42.670
- Arrested? For what?
- Disorderly conduct.

36:42.670 --> 36:44.830
- Seriously?
- Yeah! He's ok though.

36:44.830 --> 36:48.310
They'll release him to you. No questions
asked. No one has to know.

36:48.550 --> 36:54.030
He's at the Ratra Wang police station.

36:54.030 --> 36:56.150
Ok. I'll call you when we get there.

36:56.150 --> 36:58.550
Teddy's in jail, but he's fine. We
gotta get a cab.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.590
- Ok!
- Alright!

37:04.830 --> 37:07.470
- Yes, I have his paperwork here.
- Okay.

37:07.470 --> 37:11.350
- He has been treated.
- Sounds good.

37:11.350 --> 37:14.630
We're good. They've processed him for
release.

37:15.430 --> 37:17.910
They put him in the drunk tank. He's fine.

37:17.910 --> 37:21.630
Sixteen years old and spent a night in
jail. Can you imagine?

37:21.630 --> 37:24.910
Haha! We love to party.

37:27.470 --> 37:28.950
Here we go!

37:30.150 --> 37:32.710
- Wait who's this fuckin guy?
- Teddy Sisay.

37:32.710 --> 37:35.910
No, no, no, no. That's the wrong guy! Sir!

37:35.910 --> 37:40.430
Excuse me.. I'm sorry. Officer. You brought
the wrong guy. That's not Teddy!

37:40.430 --> 37:44.350
Of course it is!
We have his ID's and everything!

37:44.350 --> 37:47.350
These were in his pocket
when we made the arrest.

37:47.350 --> 37:49.310
They were in his pocket?

37:50.230 --> 37:54.150
Excuse me, sir! How did you get this stuff?

37:54.830 --> 37:56.470
Hello?

37:56.470 --> 38:01.750
Teddy doesn't speak. We tried English,
Thai, Chinese... Nothing.

38:01.750 --> 38:03.470
Let me ask you something.

38:03.470 --> 38:08.190
Does he look like he works out at Bally
Total Fitness in Palo Alto, California?

38:08.190 --> 38:14.430
Look. We arrest a lot of people. We cannot
analyze everything.

38:14.430 --> 38:18.550
- What do you expect us to do with this guy?
- Not my problem!

38:19.230 --> 38:25.150
Hey guys, I think he knows us. Hi. Hello.

38:27.870 --> 38:32.110
You know where our friend is, Teddy?
He's missing!

38:32.110 --> 38:35.750
- Stu, forget it. The guys worthless.
- He knows something!

38:35.750 --> 38:38.590
He's wearing Teddy's sweatshirt.

38:38.590 --> 38:44.430
Maybe he just doesn't understand. I'll
act it out. Yeah, like charades. Watch.

38:44.430 --> 38:46.910
- Two words.
- Is it a movie?

38:46.910 --> 38:49.510
This is not for you, Alan!

38:50.670 --> 38:56.990
- American teenager... in Asia.
- Karate Kid, with Jaden Smith.

38:56.950 --> 38:59.670
It's easy cause you're talking to him.

38:59.670 --> 39:03.310
Stu, it's a waste of time! Just leave
this fucking guy here.

39:03.310 --> 39:07.190
Here's something. There are 500 thousand
monks living in Thailand.

39:07.190 --> 39:13.470
It is not uncommon for some monks to take
a vow of silence, at the age of eight.

39:13.470 --> 39:14.550
There you go.

39:14.550 --> 39:17.270
- Anything else in that envelope?
- Nah, it's empty.

39:18.870 --> 39:23.830
Woah, hang on. A drink card from White
Lion bar in Bangkok?

39:24.630 --> 39:26.910
Worth a shot.

39:28.350 --> 39:31.350
Jesus christ! Is this the right street?

39:31.350 --> 39:33.710
That's what it says.

39:39.270 --> 39:44.190
- Whoa! This is the White Lion!
- What the fuck happened here?

39:44.190 --> 39:46.710
Holy shit!

39:46.710 --> 39:50.710
<i>(yelling in Thai)</i>

39:50.830 --> 39:53.790
- Let's...
- We should probably...

39:58.030 --> 39:59.630
That's ok.

39:59.630 --> 40:02.750
What the fuck is going on here?

40:04.030 --> 40:09.230
- Whoa, guys. Check it out!
- Holy shit! Stu, look!

40:09.230 --> 40:15.230
That's my face. Go, go go!
Nice work, Alan!

40:16.710 --> 40:19.750
- Hello?
- Be with you in a minute!

40:23.190 --> 40:26.470
- Excuse me.
- Oh, look who it is!

40:26.470 --> 40:30.150
- So what do ya think?
- What, I'm sorry?

40:30.150 --> 40:35.390
- The tattoo. You love it?
- Uh, no. Actually, I hate it.

40:35.390 --> 40:38.190
- No refunds. Get the fuck out!
- Wait a second!

40:38.190 --> 40:39.750
Read the sign!

40:39.750 --> 40:41.270
NO REFUNDS. GET THE FUCK OUT OF HERE.

40:41.270 --> 40:43.870
We don't want any refunds. We just have
a couple of questions.

40:43.870 --> 40:45.910
We're trying to figure out what went
down last night.

40:45.910 --> 40:50.510
What went down? Take a look at what you
did outside. Half the neighborhood went down.

40:50.510 --> 40:54.350
- We did that?
- You don't remember getting into a bar fight at the White Lion?

40:54.350 --> 40:59.630
- Starting a full on fuckin riot?
- Sir, we don't remember anything.

41:03.550 --> 41:06.670
Oh boy...

41:07.550 --> 41:10.350
Check this out!

41:13.470 --> 41:15.710
Oh shit!

41:18.430 --> 41:22.150
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

41:25.190 --> 41:27.950
There's Teddy! He was with us!

41:40.830 --> 41:42.310
Jesus christ!

41:42.310 --> 41:45.030
That's when the cops arrived and started
cracking skulls.

41:45.030 --> 41:47.830
I took you guys and hid you in the
shop here.

41:47.830 --> 41:52.070
Then you decided to get a tattoo.
You cried like a little bitch.

41:52.070 --> 41:55.270
This kid is fucking nine years old. He's
got balls twice your size.

41:55.270 --> 41:58.990
- Show him your balls, Nao!
- No, no, no. That's ok.

41:58.990 --> 42:02.550
Listen, we're looking for our friend Teddy.
Have you seen him?

42:02.550 --> 42:04.670
Not since last night. Why? What happened?

42:04.670 --> 42:08.270
Yeah, I'm supposed to marry his sister
tomorrow and we kinda lost him.

42:09.510 --> 42:13.670
- Oh well. Then fuck it!
- What do you mean, fuck it?

42:13.670 --> 42:17.190
Bangkok has him now and she'll never
let him go.

42:17.190 --> 42:21.310
- You hear that, huh? Is this what you
wanted? You happy now?

42:21.310 --> 42:24.750
You're wasting your time. These monks
take their vow shit seriously.

42:24.750 --> 42:29.830
Look at this. That's the sign of the Chang
Mai Monastery, just outside of town.

42:29.830 --> 42:32.990
Maybe somebody over there can get him
to talk.

42:37.390 --> 42:39.990
- Ok, can we just go over this one
more time? You got the beer from...

42:40.110 --> 42:42.990
- The hotel bar. They gave me a sealed case.
- Right.

42:44.030 --> 42:46.550
- But, who gave it to you?
- The bartender.

42:47.350 --> 42:49.710
And then you brought em out and
I  opened them.

42:49.710 --> 42:53.190
Yeah and Doug had one and he was fine
so it's not the beer.

42:53.190 --> 42:55.590
- So what the hell happened?
- I have no idea!

42:55.590 --> 42:58.910
Hey guys. Check it out. He's got a
Chinese boner.

42:58.910 --> 43:02.070
Alan, come on! Cut it out!

43:04.390 --> 43:08.630
- That is so wrong!
- Don't stop monkey, keep doing it.

43:18.110 --> 43:23.110
When a monkey nibbles on a penis
it's funny in any language!

43:24.230 --> 43:26.350
Keep doing it!

43:28.110 --> 43:29.430
Alright, thank you!

43:31.390 --> 43:34.910
Bye Shannon! Bye Little Wayne!

43:44.390 --> 43:47.150
Wow! So beautiful!

43:49.270 --> 43:51.790
What is this, a PF Chang's?

43:53.030 --> 43:55.870
Ah, they're meditating.

43:55.870 --> 43:59.070
- Such a peaceful people!
- Yeah.

43:59.070 --> 44:02.870
- Knock, knock! Hello!
- Alan! Show some respect!

44:02.870 --> 44:06.910
- Don't get up guys.
- We brought one of your guys back.

44:06.910 --> 44:09.750
He's really funny. He's really nice
and cool.

44:09.750 --> 44:13.190
Hi, how you doing. You the one in charge?

44:15.710 --> 44:18.630
- Excuse me... ow... Wait!
- Stop it! Calm down!

44:19.910 --> 44:24.550
Hold on. It's because we're talking.

44:24.550 --> 44:27.270
God damn it! Oh! Stop!

44:27.270 --> 44:30.190
Wait it's me!

44:30.190 --> 44:31.990
Oh I get it.

44:35.150 --> 44:38.670
No talk! No talk! Shh.. Ok...

44:44.110 --> 44:46.390
Ok.

45:04.950 --> 45:09.710
Late last night, you climbed the walls
of our monastery.

45:09.710 --> 45:16.550
Shouting out questions about love, marriage
and the meaning of life.

45:16.990 --> 45:20.430
Poor brother Han was meditating alone
in the garden.

45:20.430 --> 45:24.590
- And you took him.
- Oh my god!

45:24.990 --> 45:29.350
- We kidnapped a monk.
- We live an alternative life style.

45:29.310 --> 45:34.510
We are so sorry about that, but we weren't
ourselves last night.

45:34.510 --> 45:40.550
Yep, things kinda spun outta control a little
bit. But there's a boy who's missing and hurt.

45:40.550 --> 45:43.710
Can you find out if he knows where our
friend is?

45:43.710 --> 45:47.030
Brother Han took a vow of silence many
years ago.

45:47.030 --> 45:49.110
It would be useless to try.

45:49.110 --> 45:53.190
Well maybe he can write down what happened,
on a piece of paper?

45:53.190 --> 45:56.230
Actually Phil, that would be cheating.
Isn't that right, Grand Wizard.

45:56.230 --> 45:59.150
- Alan!
- I'm afraid fatty is right.

45:59.150 --> 46:01.070
See?... What?

46:01.070 --> 46:04.910
None of us will ever know what brother
Han knows.

46:05.870 --> 46:09.150
Oh, alright. Well, so much for holy people.
Bunch of bald assholes. C'mon, let's go.

46:09.150 --> 46:13.190
Hey you know what! FYI! You may want to
put some signs up that say no talking...

46:13.190 --> 46:15.430
- ...before you unleash your dragon.
- Yeah, that was a little rough.

46:15.430 --> 46:18.510
And "your welcome" for bringing him
back safe.

46:18.510 --> 46:21.350
- You know we found him in the drunk tank.
- Yeah well we did take him in the first place.

46:21.390 --> 46:25.110
- C'mon guys, let's go.
- Wait!

46:25.950 --> 46:31.590
The Buddha teach, every memory lives
somewhere deep within.

46:31.590 --> 46:36.310
Perhaps you should bring your question
to the Garden of Meditation.

46:36.310 --> 46:39.390
- Did you understand a word he just said?
- Yeah, yeah. About two thirds.

46:39.390 --> 46:41.030
He said something about the Garden of
Meditation?

46:41.030 --> 46:43.630
No, he said he's farting because of
his medication.

46:43.630 --> 46:45.950
I get that.

46:50.830 --> 46:55.750
It's a waste of time. I don't remember
anything. Do you?

46:55.750 --> 47:00.950
No. I got nothing. Alan?

47:03.070 --> 47:04.750
Alan!

47:07.510 --> 47:10.550
<i>"Every memory lives somewhere deep within"</i>

47:10.630 --> 47:12.070
<i>- Sweetie.
- What?</i>

47:12.430 --> 47:13.670
<i>You have visitors.</i>

47:13.910 --> 47:15.670
<i>- Hey, Alan!
- Hey, guys!</i>

47:15.790 --> 47:17.590
<i>- Hey, Phil.
- Hey buddy!</i>

47:17.670 --> 47:19.430
<i>Stu would like to invite you to his wedding.</i>

47:19.630 --> 47:23.190
<i>- Is this true, Stuart?
- Yeah, why not. It'll be fun.</i>

47:24.550 --> 47:25.470
<i>Fuck!</i>

47:25.550 --> 47:29.110
<i>- For Lauren and Stu!
- Cheers!</i>

47:31.630 --> 47:34.670
<i>- Chow!
- We had a sick night bitches!</i>

47:36.070 --> 47:37.430
<i>Alan, what the fuck!</i>

47:38.630 --> 47:40.470
<i>Is that person coming to the wedding?</i>

47:40.550 --> 47:43.990
<i>- There is no wolfpack.
- Alan, Alan, don't do that!</i>

47:44.070 --> 47:45.630
<i>And finally...</i>

47:45.750 --> 47:47.990
<i>The three best friends anyone could have.</i>

47:57.350 --> 47:59.910
<i>Fuck the Police!</i>

48:11.350 --> 48:12.590
I know where to go.

48:15.750 --> 48:19.230
- What do you think, Alan?
- This is the place.

48:19.670 --> 48:21.230
C'mon. Let's go.

48:25.870 --> 48:27.670
I don't remember any of this!

48:28.990 --> 48:32.230
- Yeah Alan, you sure this is the place?
- Yeah, pretty sure.

48:40.110 --> 48:41.910
Rose! Harmony!

48:42.630 --> 48:44.750
Is he coming or what? I've been waiting
all day for him.

48:44.910 --> 48:48.990
- I'm sorry. Waiting for who?
- Chow, that dick ass fuck!

48:49.950 --> 48:52.350
- Why? What's wrong?
- Nothings wrong.

48:52.870 --> 48:57.390
Ok, good. Look at this. Look what I
bring for him. Check it out, huh.

48:57.550 --> 48:59.830
- No, no!
- $ 6,000 American.

48:59.950 --> 49:02.030
Wow looks so real!

49:08.310 --> 49:09.510
Sorry!

49:09.870 --> 49:14.910
- Alan, what the fuck!
- It's ok. The gun, it's very sensitive.

49:15.350 --> 49:17.310
Everybody ok?

49:17.990 --> 49:22.990
Ok, then get the fuck back to work!
Come on. Music, please!

49:23.750 --> 49:25.150
Where is my 6,000 dollars?

49:25.310 --> 49:28.790
6,000? No, no, no. This is Chow's deal. We
got nothing to do with that.

49:29.030 --> 49:30.790
Un-fucking believable.

49:30.950 --> 49:34.430
This guy, if he backs out again, the
shits gonna catch up with him.

49:34.550 --> 49:38.150
He's made a lot of enemies in this town,
and now they're gonna be your enemies.

49:38.230 --> 49:39.550
That's not fair!

49:39.670 --> 49:42.030
Ok listen. We're just looking for a
little kid.

49:42.150 --> 49:43.910
- 2,000 dollars.
- What!

49:44.070 --> 49:46.670
I don't know, maybe more. How young you
want this kid to be?

49:46.790 --> 49:53.270
No, no! Sorry, you misunderstood. We're
looking for our friend... 16 years old.

49:53.390 --> 49:55.110
- Teddy.
- Teddy?

49:55.310 --> 49:57.430
- Yeah he was here with you guys last night.
- He was?

49:57.550 --> 49:59.030
Do you know if he left with us?

49:59.190 --> 50:01.670
I don't know. You were in the corner all
night with Kimmy.

50:01.790 --> 50:03.350
- I didn't see you leave.
- Kimmy?

50:03.470 --> 50:06.630
- Is she here?
- Yes, she's in the back. She just came for her shit.

50:06.750 --> 50:07.990
Go and talk to her.

50:08.350 --> 50:10.750
Alright, listen. I'm sorry about everything
that happened.

50:10.870 --> 50:13.150
Listen to me, ok? Pay attention to what
I'm going to talk to you know.

50:13.230 --> 50:17.110
When you see Chow, you tell him Samir
says "Hello".

50:17.190 --> 50:17.950
Okay!

50:18.030 --> 50:22.550
But do it like that, ok! "Hello" like
threatening. Like, ironic.

50:23.790 --> 50:24.950
- "Hellooo"
- Okay!

50:32.470 --> 50:33.950
Go away! Go away!

50:34.430 --> 50:35.350
??

50:35.590 --> 50:38.910
Of course I remember him. He was buying
shots for everyone.

50:39.030 --> 50:42.470
Nice kid! His parents must be so proud.

50:42.550 --> 50:43.910
You have no idea.

50:44.190 --> 50:46.550
Ok, so do you remember if he left with us?

50:46.670 --> 50:50.270
Yeah, you were all leaving together, but
you almost forgot this one right here.

50:50.430 --> 50:52.350
Right, super star?

50:53.510 --> 50:57.470
This one was following me around like a
little puppy dog. All night.

50:57.790 --> 51:01.510
Saying he'd fallen in love with me. Asked
me to marry him.

51:02.870 --> 51:04.590
Classic Stu!

51:05.550 --> 51:08.110
- We didn't get married, did we?
- Course not!

51:08.270 --> 51:10.550
We just had some fun in the Chardonnay room.

51:10.710 --> 51:14.110
- What happens in the Chardonnay room?
- Let's just stay on task.

51:14.230 --> 51:19.270
I danced for him. He tickled me. We had sex.

51:19.390 --> 51:21.830
- Fuck!
- It's ok. You're not married yet.

51:21.950 --> 51:23.670
- No big deal.
- It's cheating!

51:23.790 --> 51:26.510
No offense to you. You're a lovely woman.

51:26.670 --> 51:28.630
It's a violation of my moral code.

51:28.790 --> 51:33.950
Don't be sad. Stu you loved it. You were
crying, saying how special it was.

51:34.070 --> 51:37.710
- Wait! I'm sorry. He was crying?
- What a baby. He was crying.

51:37.830 --> 51:42.110
You should have seen him. He was so
sexy. The way he moved around.

51:42.430 --> 51:45.070
I had to ask him to slow down so I didn't
drop my load too quick.

51:47.630 --> 51:52.390
- Load? What load?
- Oh, you know... My sperms.

51:53.870 --> 51:57.070
I think your English is off. You're talking
about my sperm!

51:58.190 --> 52:01.110
- Where would your sperm come from?
- From my balls!

52:01.270 --> 52:03.550
- Hold on! Back up!
- Wait... Are you...

52:06.030 --> 52:07.710
Hey. You're in Bangkok, sweetie.

52:07.830 --> 52:10.110
- There's a reason they don't call it "Bang-cunt".
- Oh!

52:15.350 --> 52:16.910
- Oh god!
- Wow.

52:20.870 --> 52:22.750
I don't get it. Is this a magic show?

52:23.990 --> 52:28.150
Come on, Stu, it was beautiful. We climaxed
at the same time.

52:29.030 --> 52:30.510
How's that work?

52:30.630 --> 52:33.270
Shoot my load into you. Shoot your load
on the floor.

52:33.910 --> 52:37.710
- Ok!
- You ruined me. Ruined bottom.

52:38.870 --> 52:40.950
Oh god!

52:47.670 --> 52:52.510
- Stu! It's not the end of the world.
- Sorry, but I'm so confused.

52:53.550 --> 52:56.510
I made love to a man... with boobies.

52:56.790 --> 53:00.270
Listen. I promise you no ones ever gonna
find out about this.

53:00.390 --> 53:01.990
But we found out about it.

53:02.070 --> 53:04.230
And then we forget. That's what we do!

53:04.350 --> 53:07.550
I do so much fucked up shit. And I just
forget about it.

53:07.670 --> 53:10.710
- Yeah?
- Yeah! Just forget! It goes away!

53:11.190 --> 53:14.230
That might be harder to go away, but in
time it'll happen.

53:14.350 --> 53:18.990
I certainly do. Just gonna forget about it.

53:19.110 --> 53:20.990
- Never happened.
- Great!

53:22.150 --> 53:24.110
Phone! Phone! Who is it? Answer!

53:24.630 --> 53:27.390
Lauren's dad. He just reminded me...

53:27.510 --> 53:29.150
- Answer it!
- I can't.

53:29.230 --> 53:31.870
What! He might know something about Teddy.
C'mon we still have a shot here.

53:31.990 --> 53:35.390
Get your head back into the fucking game, Stu!

53:39.990 --> 53:41.070
Hello?

53:41.150 --> 53:44.310
<i>Who takes an all day fishing trip the
day before a wedding?</i>

53:44.470 --> 53:49.150
- Yeah, I guess that is kinda stupid.
- Put Teddy on the phone.

53:51.550 --> 53:54.190
<i>- Teddy's seasick actually.
- Seasick?</i>

53:54.270 --> 53:59.350
- Teddy's been a Maritime cadet since he was nine.
- That's weird, cause he's puking everywhere.

53:59.510 --> 54:02.230
I'm gonna tell you something that you do
not know.

54:02.670 --> 54:05.790
- I don't like you.
- Yeah,I knew that already.

54:05.910 --> 54:07.590
<i>If my daughter chooses you,
that's her problem.</i>

54:07.670 --> 54:09.230
This is ??.
Hey it's Phil Winnick!

54:09.350 --> 54:12.110
Listen, I apologize. We've been reelin
in some crazy Marlin and I just wanna say...

54:14.310 --> 54:15.550
Phil!

54:15.630 --> 54:17.110
- Jesus!
- Phil!

54:17.430 --> 54:18.870
Fuck me!

54:18.870 --> 54:21.950
- Give us back our monkey!
- What monkey? Get your own monkey!

54:21.990 --> 54:24.630
Come on, you asshole, the fucking monkey!

54:25.030 --> 54:26.350
Come on!

54:26.470 --> 54:28.670
Anytime, Alan. He's pointing a gun at us!

54:28.790 --> 54:29.790
This is our monkey!

54:29.910 --> 54:31.990
No one's getting shot over a fucking monkey!

54:32.070 --> 54:33.710
Hand him over, now!

54:34.190 --> 54:36.430
God, I've never given him no monkeys.

54:36.910 --> 54:39.350
No, no ...

54:41.150 --> 54:44.790
Hey Phil, check it out. He's got a banana
on his helmet. He's the real deal.

54:44.870 --> 54:46.030
What the fuck's happening?

54:46.110 --> 54:48.910
Hold on! How did this happen? Do you
know where our friend is?

54:49.030 --> 54:53.430
<i>- Yeah. Sixteen years old. Asian kid.
- (says something in Russian?)</i>

54:54.070 --> 54:55.910
No, I don't understand what you said! No, I
didn't understand!

54:56.230 --> 54:58.510
What'd he say?

54:58.590 --> 55:00.550
He said fuck you and your questions!

55:03.070 --> 55:06.470
- Oh, my arm!
- Philip, are you okay?

55:06.950 --> 55:09.070
Oh I got shot! Fuck! Fuck this!

55:10.750 --> 55:12.510
It's alright, Phil! It's alright!

55:12.630 --> 55:14.830
We'll figure this out and get the monkey
back, I promise.

55:14.910 --> 55:18.710
Who gives a fuck about the monkey!

55:18.910 --> 55:24.630
- What the fuck is going on?
- Stu, am I gonna be ok? You're a doctor.

55:24.750 --> 55:26.390
I don't know, let me look!

55:28.510 --> 55:29.590
What?

55:30.710 --> 55:32.030
Don't look at it!

55:32.230 --> 55:35.430
Stuart Price! Get your ass back over here!

55:35.510 --> 55:37.110
- You got shot!
- I know!

55:52.430 --> 55:55.510
- Whoa, you all right?
- Yeah, I'm ok.

55:56.630 --> 56:00.390
Actually, bullet just grazed my arm.
Eight stitches.

56:01.070 --> 56:03.830
Only cost six dollars. How is that even
possible?

56:03.910 --> 56:05.830
How's any of this even possible?

56:09.350 --> 56:12.630
If I was a foot to my left, Stu, I'd be dead.

56:14.830 --> 56:16.390
What are we gonna do?

56:21.710 --> 56:23.870
I'm sorry guys. This wasn't part of the plan.

56:25.870 --> 56:30.190
- What plan, Alan?
- I've said too much already.

56:38.110 --> 56:40.470
Alan! What plan?

56:42.590 --> 56:45.750
- It's all Teddy's fault.
- What are you talking about, Alan?

56:45.910 --> 56:48.030
Why is he even here? He's not part of
the wolf pack!

56:48.150 --> 56:51.830
- Alan, what did you do?
- It's not my fault!

56:51.870 --> 56:54.790
Teddy shouldn't have been sharing from his bag.

56:55.790 --> 56:58.070
- What bag?
- The marshmallows.

56:58.190 --> 56:59.870
I had a separate bag just for Teddy.

56:59.990 --> 57:01.550
But it was dark and it was hard to keep
track.

57:01.670 --> 57:04.870
And then, you almost sat on em. I couldn't
tell which was which.

57:04.990 --> 57:07.710
- It was mayhem!
- What did you do to the marshmallows, Alan?

57:08.270 --> 57:10.670
Alan, what did you do?

57:11.070 --> 57:12.710
Isn't it obvious?

57:12.790 --> 57:16.870
I spiked them with muscle relaxers. And
plus my ADHD medication.

57:17.030 --> 57:18.870
- What?
- You drugged us again?!

57:18.990 --> 57:22.750
Not you! I just wanted to knock out Teddy for a
little while so we could finally enjoy the weekend.

57:22.830 --> 57:27.110
Enjoy the weekend? Alan, you told me that
you didn't do anything!

57:27.230 --> 57:28.910
Alan, you swore to god!

57:29.110 --> 57:30.830
I just wanted things to stay the same.

57:30.990 --> 57:35.390
Like at my face! You ruined my life!

57:35.790 --> 57:37.030
You're not my friend!

57:37.110 --> 57:39.670
Don't say that, Phil! You're serious?
Even in America?

57:39.750 --> 57:43.510
- Yes!
- Oh God! Don't say that, Phil!

57:43.630 --> 57:46.470
- Don't start crying, Alan!
- You're the bearded devil!

57:46.590 --> 57:49.430
You liked it! You smiled at me when I
handed you the bag with marshmallows.

57:49.550 --> 57:53.430
Because I like marshmallows, you
fucking psycho!

57:54.270 --> 57:56.790
Hey! Whoa! Hold on!

57:56.990 --> 57:58.430
Enough!

57:58.670 --> 58:01.390
- Why, Alan? Why?
- Stu!

58:01.670 --> 58:03.750
Because we're the three best
friends, remember?

58:04.190 --> 58:05.870
Remember?

58:05.870 --> 58:07.430
Stu, that's enough...

58:12.150 --> 58:14.990
Guys, we can't fall apart now. We gotta
stick together.

58:20.270 --> 58:23.110
- Alan, what's that written on your belly?
- What? Huh?

58:24.390 --> 58:27.430
Lebua Hotel, Saturday six pm.

58:27.550 --> 58:29.270
- You write that?
- No!

58:31.270 --> 58:33.190
Shit, that's in 20 minutes.

58:33.830 --> 58:35.590
What about England, Phil? Will we still
be friends there?

58:35.710 --> 58:40.470
Alan, I already told you. It was in the heat of the
moment. We're still friends. All over the world.

58:40.630 --> 58:43.230
- Even Great Britain?
- Yeah.

58:45.470 --> 58:47.030
What about you, Stu?

58:48.230 --> 58:49.590
We'll see.

58:51.230 --> 58:52.910
Gentlemen, follow me.

59:07.190 --> 59:08.430
Here you go.

59:12.830 --> 59:14.750
Well. About time! Sit down.

59:15.390 --> 59:17.230
Come on, sit.

59:18.150 --> 59:19.830
Wow, you guys look like shit.

59:22.710 --> 59:24.030
- Uh, do we know you?
- Hey!

59:24.150 --> 59:27.310
Take off your fuckin hat. You're in a
restaurant for christs sake. C'mon.

59:32.710 --> 59:35.550
Ok, listen. We have no clue what's
going on here.

59:35.670 --> 59:39.350
You know, they sell a Plum whiskey here,
it's fuckin unreal.

59:39.670 --> 59:46.790
Seriously, it will absolutely fuck you up! Oh, I'm
sorry. You guys already got fucked up, didn't you.

59:48.350 --> 59:53.510
- Uh, listen, I'm a little confused. How did you...
- You know what? I am a little fuckin confused!

59:53.630 --> 01:00:00.230
Where's Chow? With the fuckin account
code and the fuckin password!

01:00:05.470 --> 01:00:10.950
We don't know anything about any codes. We're
just trying to find our friend.

01:00:13.350 --> 01:00:17.670
- Teddy?
- Yes! Teddy! Have you seen?

01:00:21.470 --> 01:00:22.710
Hmm, let's see...

01:00:24.270 --> 01:00:25.550
There's Teddy!

01:00:26.670 --> 01:00:29.670
Holy shit! It's from last night.

01:00:31.230 --> 01:00:34.190
- Who are you?
- I'm a businessman.

01:00:34.390 --> 01:00:38.430
And I've invested a large chunk of capital
in your friend Chow.

01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:42.350
And in return, he was supposed to transfer
my profits electronically.

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:45.590
About five fuckin minutes ago.

01:00:46.470 --> 01:00:50.070
So last night, we took Teddy as insurance.

01:00:50.830 --> 01:00:55.990
- Oh my god! Is he okay?
- Oh my god, I wasn't done talking.

01:00:56.910 --> 01:01:00.070
You tell Chow, that we are having breakfast
on the roof of this hotel...

01:01:00.150 --> 01:01:03.590
...tomorrow morning at eight am.

01:01:03.670 --> 01:01:05.630
Or if he makes the transfer, you will
get Teddy.

01:01:05.750 --> 01:01:09.190
If not well then hey, you know...
it's Bangkok.

01:01:11.830 --> 01:01:13.830
That's your cue to get the fuck out of here.

01:01:20.270 --> 01:01:21.990
Hey, you know what? Leave the hat.

01:01:23.750 --> 01:01:24.990
Alan leave the hat.

01:01:27.150 --> 01:01:28.630
Atta boy.

01:01:37.470 --> 01:01:40.950
We're fucked! Chow's dead. What do we do now?

01:01:41.030 --> 01:01:44.390
The guy doesn't give a shit about Chow, Stu.
This whole things about a fucking bank account.

01:01:46.710 --> 01:01:49.230
Let's just go back to the hotel. We'll
search Chow's body.

01:01:49.350 --> 01:01:51.870
Hopefully the password's in his
wallet or something.

01:01:52.510 --> 01:01:54.790
- And what if it isn't?
- He's gonna kill Teddy.

01:01:54.870 --> 01:01:58.510
Just relax. We have until 8am tomorrow
to figure it out.

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:06.510
First the monkey and now my hat. How
much worse can this day get.

01:02:10.390 --> 01:02:12.150
Jesus christ!

01:02:19.270 --> 01:02:29.190
<i>Well we're livin here in Alan town. And
he's drivin our lives into the ground.</i>

01:02:30.030 --> 01:02:34.070
<i>When we woke up we were wasted and drunk.</i>

01:02:34.190 --> 01:02:39.670
<i>Phil got shot. We got beaten by a monk.</i>

01:02:41.830 --> 01:02:46.390
<i>I was happy, and my life was good.</i>

01:02:46.910 --> 01:02:51.270
<i>Getting married like a dentist should.</i>

01:02:51.390 --> 01:02:54.830
<i>Roasting marshmallows on a stick.</i>

01:02:54.990 --> 01:03:01.070
<i>I got fucked in the ass... by a girl
with a dick.</i>

01:03:02.190 --> 01:03:03.830
Oh yeah, remember that.

01:03:06.350 --> 01:03:10.430
<i>And we're livin in Alan town.</i>

01:03:12.870 --> 01:03:14.230
There's water everywhere.

01:03:15.030 --> 01:03:17.830
Yeah it's cause it melted, Stu. The
fuckin powers out.

01:03:17.910 --> 01:03:20.630
With an inadequate electrical grid,
serving millions of people

01:03:20.750 --> 01:03:23.870
Bangkok experiences 1500 power
outages per year.

01:03:23.990 --> 01:03:25.870
Seriously, Alan. That's enough!

01:03:26.030 --> 01:03:27.390
Out of the way!

01:03:33.630 --> 01:03:34.870
We got it.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:41.950
Oh my god!

01:03:43.390 --> 01:03:46.110
Chow, calm down!

01:03:46.230 --> 01:03:47.910
- You put the chill on me?
- No, no!

01:03:51.590 --> 01:03:53.070
It's okay.

01:03:53.630 --> 01:03:55.310
Relax!

01:04:03.390 --> 01:04:07.470
It's just us. Breathe!

01:04:07.590 --> 01:04:08.750
It was so cold.

01:04:08.830 --> 01:04:11.070
- We're gonna warm you up.
- I was so cold!

01:04:12.110 --> 01:04:15.790
- You did good, buddy. You did good.
- I did good.

01:04:21.110 --> 01:04:22.270
Feelin better?

01:04:23.470 --> 01:04:26.070
- Alright, you warm enough?
- I don't know.

01:04:26.190 --> 01:04:28.030
Come feel my bowels and tell me.

01:04:28.110 --> 01:04:30.910
I've been locked in a fuckin ice box
all day!

01:04:31.350 --> 01:04:33.910
Hey Alan, if you want my sunglasses...

01:04:33.990 --> 01:04:36.950
...just ask Chow. You don't have to kill me.

01:04:37.030 --> 01:04:40.910
Chow, nobody killed you. You were already
dead. You didn't have a pulse.

01:04:41.030 --> 01:04:42.870
Oh, you never do blow before?

01:04:42.990 --> 01:04:45.110
Sometimes your heart stop... start
up again.

01:04:45.510 --> 01:04:48.550
- Read a book!
- Look I'm sorry. We're having a bad day.

01:04:48.670 --> 01:04:52.150
Oh, you're having a bad day! Did you die?

01:04:52.830 --> 01:04:55.510
- I got shot!
- But did you die?

01:04:55.670 --> 01:04:58.990
Chow, some guy told us that you got
a bank code or something...

01:04:59.070 --> 01:05:01.110
...and if we don't bring it to him first
think in the morning...

01:05:02.390 --> 01:05:03.830
...he's gonna kill Teddy.

01:05:03.830 --> 01:05:09.990
Who, Kingsley? He harmless. Don't worry.
I got the bank codes.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:15.670
Great! Alright, we gotta meet him at 8am.
Who is that fuckin guy, anyway?

01:05:15.750 --> 01:05:19.110
- An investor in my business.
- Yeah, what business is that?

01:05:19.230 --> 01:05:21.670
It's called "not your business" ok!

01:05:22.350 --> 01:05:25.590
- Oh, where's the monkey?
- The monkey...

01:05:25.710 --> 01:05:29.550
Yeah I put the account number and
password in his vest. Where is he?

01:05:32.270 --> 01:05:35.670
- Why would you do that?
- Safe keeping, pretty boy.

01:05:35.750 --> 01:05:42.870
I got a lotta heat on my ass. I got
FBI, Bangkok PD, Interpol, MSNBC...

01:05:43.430 --> 01:05:45.310
That little monkey snorting coke with me
all night...

01:05:45.390 --> 01:05:48.270
Jerkin me off while I watched Stu make
fuckin lady boy.

01:05:48.590 --> 01:05:52.190
- He not going anywhere.
- We don't have the monkey, Chow.

01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:55.030
Oh, some Russian thugs took him from us.

01:05:55.110 --> 01:05:57.110
Oh you fucking guys!

01:05:57.950 --> 01:06:01.550
Okay. No problem. We just have to get
him back.

01:06:01.710 --> 01:06:04.870
- From where?
- From the same place we took him from.

01:06:25.630 --> 01:06:27.710
This monkey isn't just normal monkey.

01:06:40.310 --> 01:06:42.790
Every night, monkey drug mule.

01:06:44.310 --> 01:06:46.470
He take coke to buyer...

01:06:49.550 --> 01:06:53.150
And deliver cash to dealer. He
middle man.

01:06:53.830 --> 01:06:55.950
Dealer never handle drug directly.

01:06:56.670 --> 01:06:58.150
He clean.

01:06:59.870 --> 01:07:04.070
- That's terrible.
- Not terrible. What he talking about. Fucking genius.

01:07:04.430 --> 01:07:06.270
You ever see monkey go to jail?

01:07:08.070 --> 01:07:12.350
We just take the monkey for deal, he come
close, we take his vest. That's that.

01:07:12.910 --> 01:07:17.190
- We get some blow too, you know... bump.
- No, no more bumps, Chow.

01:07:19.310 --> 01:07:21.030
This is ridiculous.

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:26.070
Stu, Mr. Chow can't whistle. Shake your
monkey.

01:07:37.670 --> 01:07:38.750
Alright, here we go.

01:07:38.830 --> 01:07:40.190
Come on!

01:07:45.150 --> 01:07:47.270
How did we wind up with the monkey
last night anyway?

01:07:47.350 --> 01:07:49.510
I needed some blow and Alan thought
he was cute...

01:07:49.630 --> 01:07:50.870
...so we stole him!

01:08:02.670 --> 01:08:04.070
So stupid!

01:08:04.070 --> 01:08:05.550
Stu, ready to grab vest?

01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:10.150
- Okay. I just grab it?
- Yeah, just do it. Just do it.

01:08:10.270 --> 01:08:12.950
- Hey, little monkey.
- Alan, be quiet.

01:08:16.189 --> 01:08:18.870
- Fuck!
- We gotta go, right now!

01:08:19.750 --> 01:08:23.069
- Pull that fuckin monkey in!
- I'm trying!

01:08:27.390 --> 01:08:28.430
Shit!

01:08:31.910 --> 01:08:35.029
- Get that monkey in here, Stu!
- He won't let go!

01:08:35.990 --> 01:08:38.069
Stu, get back in the car! Right now!

01:08:38.630 --> 01:08:40.630
I'm trying! Slow down!

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:48.550
He's so strong!

01:08:51.710 --> 01:08:53.630
Let go you fuckin monkey!

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:58.430
- Look out!
- Oh shit! Tight squeeze!

01:09:00.350 --> 01:09:01.630
I got him!

01:09:04.910 --> 01:09:08.149
- Where's the code, Chow?
- Check his little vest.

01:09:11.550 --> 01:09:13.710
- Got it, Alan?
- Yes, I got a .

01:09:13.790 --> 01:09:17.069
- Slow down Chow!
- Hold on, J-Birds.

01:09:20.550 --> 01:09:22.029
Holy Shit!

01:09:23.470 --> 01:09:25.390
Don't worry. I got this shit!

01:09:27.510 --> 01:09:29.029
Pig!

01:09:33.109 --> 01:09:34.430
Oh, my word.

01:09:34.590 --> 01:09:35.950
Sorry, Stu! My bad!

01:09:41.630 --> 01:09:42.750
Oh, shit!

01:09:43.910 --> 01:09:45.029
Get down!

01:09:45.390 --> 01:09:46.790
What the fuck!

01:09:47.790 --> 01:09:50.430
Oh no! He shot the monkey!

01:09:50.670 --> 01:09:53.189
They shot the monkey.

01:09:53.310 --> 01:09:55.030
I'm at my wits end.

01:09:57.910 --> 01:09:59.510
He's coming back around.

01:10:00.190 --> 01:10:01.350
Look out!

01:10:05.070 --> 01:10:07.790
- Holy fuck!
- Oh no...

01:10:26.390 --> 01:10:28.350
- Everyone alright?
- Yeah.

01:10:29.430 --> 01:10:31.990
I have such an erection right now!

01:10:36.230 --> 01:10:37.550
Are you for real?

01:10:51.710 --> 01:10:53.950
They're gonna take good care of you
here, ok.

01:10:56.390 --> 01:10:57.710
What's that?

01:11:00.150 --> 01:11:04.750
Oh, yeah. Cigarettes. Got em right here.
Here you go.

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:10.230
Right here.

01:11:13.110 --> 01:11:16.070
Deep breathe. Good.

01:11:17.390 --> 01:11:19.630
Soak it in.

01:11:19.910 --> 01:11:23.070
Breathe the smoke into your tiny
little lungs. There you go.

01:11:24.230 --> 01:11:26.670
It's funny. I've never been much of a
smoker, but...

01:11:28.070 --> 01:11:30.030
Boy does it look cool on you.

01:11:30.350 --> 01:11:32.910
Alan, c'mon! Let's go!

01:11:35.910 --> 01:11:37.750
I'll miss you, monkey.

01:11:40.550 --> 01:11:42.670
I wish monkeys could Skype.

01:11:44.350 --> 01:11:45.950
Maybe one day...

01:11:53.270 --> 01:11:55.750
Come on! Get in!

01:12:30.550 --> 01:12:32.390
Are you guys seriously this calm?

01:12:32.510 --> 01:12:35.030
Relax, Stuart. It's classic switcheroo.

01:12:35.110 --> 01:12:36.950
I give him money, he gives us Teddy.

01:12:37.190 --> 01:12:39.670
You ever do anything that doesn't end
up in a standoff, Chow?

01:12:39.750 --> 01:12:42.910
I'm an international criminal. It always
ends like this.

01:12:43.030 --> 01:12:44.710
I met my wife at one of these things.

01:12:45.630 --> 01:12:49.710
- You got a wife?
- Yeah, we married 15 years.

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:52.310
What, I not good looking enough for woman?

01:12:53.390 --> 01:12:55.030
No, that's cool.

01:12:56.670 --> 01:12:57.670
Let's do this!

01:12:57.790 --> 01:13:00.470
- Welcome to the Tower Club.
- Blah blah blah, who cares.

01:13:01.990 --> 01:13:04.270
Stop! Chow crossing.

01:13:07.630 --> 01:13:10.790
- Hey, Kingsley!
- Well, well.

01:13:10.910 --> 01:13:12.670
Propecia looking nice!

01:13:12.830 --> 01:13:14.710
You been hitting the gym?

01:13:14.910 --> 01:13:17.990
Yes I am actually. Thank you for
noticing, Chow.

01:13:18.270 --> 01:13:19.990
Hey, guys. Have a seat.

01:13:20.910 --> 01:13:24.070
- Where's Teddy?
- He's waiting downstairs in my car.

01:13:24.310 --> 01:13:26.390
Send him up when the transfer is complete.

01:13:26.470 --> 01:13:29.230
Tell you what. Give me extra 50 grand, you
keep Teddy.

01:13:29.350 --> 01:13:31.950
And I throw in this other fat fuck for free.

01:13:34.030 --> 01:13:36.830
- Chow.. Chow...
- Could we move this along!

01:13:36.950 --> 01:13:41.270
Alan, account number. Come on, come on.

01:13:41.430 --> 01:13:51.030
8-1-4, K as in knife, 2-3-9-8.

01:13:52.190 --> 01:13:54.910
- Password?
- "baloney1"

01:13:55.550 --> 01:13:56.910
Your password is "baloney1" ?

01:13:57.030 --> 01:13:59.790
Well it used to be just "baloney" but
now they make you add number.

01:14:00.030 --> 01:14:01.910
Fuckin annoying.

01:14:12.750 --> 01:14:14.190
- And it's that easy.
- Ta dah!

01:14:15.590 --> 01:14:17.510
Oh look. You sunk my battleship.

01:14:19.110 --> 01:14:25.910
- Great, now can we please have Teddy?
- Yeah. Bring him up.

01:14:26.830 --> 01:14:30.070
See. We go to your wedding. We have fun. I
bust a nut.

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:32.150
We did it, Stu. It's over!

01:14:41.350 --> 01:14:43.870
This is Bangkok police! Everybody down!

01:14:46.870 --> 01:14:48.070
Oh, nuts!

01:14:48.190 --> 01:14:50.310
Kingsley, you're fucking Five-O?

01:14:50.430 --> 01:14:51.750
Gotcha, Leslie!

01:14:51.990 --> 01:14:53.030
Get him outta here.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:54.510
Go! Just do it! Go!

01:14:59.390 --> 01:15:00.870
How the fuck...

01:15:01.470 --> 01:15:06.070
Samir, you fucked me over six grand?
You camel jockey!

01:15:08.070 --> 01:15:10.470
You spit on me?

01:15:11.230 --> 01:15:15.590
Six grand this time, eight grand last time.
It's not the money, man, it's the principle!

01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:18.510
Principle? Nigga, please! We both dead inside.

01:15:18.590 --> 01:15:20.910
Call me nigga... don't call me "nigga"!

01:15:20.990 --> 01:15:23.750
- Put em in, motherfucker!
- He's an asshole, man.

01:15:25.070 --> 01:15:26.470
You guys ok?

01:15:26.550 --> 01:15:29.670
- What the fucks going on?
- Detective Inspector Peters, Interpol.

01:15:29.790 --> 01:15:31.030
- You're a cop?
- Yes.

01:15:31.150 --> 01:15:32.950
This sting operation has been in place
for weeks.

01:15:33.750 --> 01:15:36.190
When Samir told us that your friend
was lost...

01:15:36.390 --> 01:15:40.830
We took advantage of that information.
I'm sorry.

01:15:42.270 --> 01:15:45.990
- So can Teddy come out of the car now?
- No, Alan, Teddy's not in the fuckin car!

01:15:46.110 --> 01:15:47.910
They don't have him. They never had him.

01:15:48.470 --> 01:15:52.430
They just needed us to bring them Chow.
They used Teddy as bait.

01:15:53.870 --> 01:15:56.710
- Do you have any leads at all?
- No. We've checked everywhere.

01:15:56.870 --> 01:15:58.750
No one has seen him. I'm sorry.

01:15:59.790 --> 01:16:04.510
If you haven't found him by now, I'm afraid
Bangkok has him.

01:16:09.030 --> 01:16:11.190
Why do people keep saying that?

01:16:13.790 --> 01:16:17.230
Stu... It's time.

01:16:22.430 --> 01:16:23.670
Alan...

01:16:24.670 --> 01:16:28.950
-I'm sorry.
- Don't say that. Please.

01:16:29.030 --> 01:16:33.150
- No this time we really fucked up.
- Oh god! How bad?

01:16:33.350 --> 01:16:35.270
<i>Like, no wedding bad?</i>

01:16:37.190 --> 01:16:38.750
Yeah... a little worse than that!

01:17:04.350 --> 01:17:08.030
Ok, how about this? He fell off
the fishing boat and drowned.

01:17:09.470 --> 01:17:10.750
No.

01:17:12.070 --> 01:17:15.150
Ok, I got it. Teddy was hit by a truck.

01:17:15.950 --> 01:17:18.950
- Alan!
- Not a good time, Phil. Kinda busy!

01:17:19.030 --> 01:17:20.830
How many people get run over here?

01:17:20.910 --> 01:17:24.150
- Over 1200 a year, Phil.
- Perfect!

01:17:24.510 --> 01:17:27.430
His body was too mangled to recover.
Case closed.

01:17:29.070 --> 01:17:30.630
Can I get more ice, please?

01:17:31.790 --> 01:17:33.270
I'm not gonna lie to Lauren.

01:17:33.430 --> 01:17:40.710
- Stu, do you want this or not?
- Look at what I've done, Phil. What I do.

01:17:43.750 --> 01:17:48.270
I have a weakness for prostitutes. All
kinds, apparently.

01:17:52.470 --> 01:17:57.030
- I have a demon in me!
- So what?

01:17:58.470 --> 01:18:01.430
Teddy's gone, but I can still save Lauren.

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:03.390
Just let her live her life without me.

01:18:03.430 --> 01:18:04.670
Stu!

01:18:04.790 --> 01:18:07.950
I want you to call Doug and tell him I'm
never coming back.

01:18:08.470 --> 01:18:10.350
Gettin off the hamster wheel.

01:18:11.830 --> 01:18:15.350
Gonna stay here in Bangkok.
I think I belong here.

01:18:16.310 --> 01:18:18.390
Open up a little dentists office.

01:18:19.670 --> 01:18:21.710
Deep cleanings, with a happy ending.

01:18:25.750 --> 01:18:27.110
You sure about this?

01:18:34.430 --> 01:18:36.750
Hey, what the crud!

01:18:38.270 --> 01:18:39.630
Powers out, Alan.

01:18:43.830 --> 01:18:44.910
- Phil!
- Doug.

01:18:45.110 --> 01:18:47.390
- I need answers, man.
- I know...

01:18:48.310 --> 01:18:49.270
Doug, who are you talking to?

01:18:49.350 --> 01:18:50.230
- What?
- Give me the phone!

01:18:50.350 --> 01:18:51.470
Lauren, no! That's a private...

01:18:51.550 --> 01:18:52.630
Who is this?

01:18:52.710 --> 01:18:56.030
- Lauren?
- Phil? Tell me what's going on, right now!

01:18:56.630 --> 01:18:58.110
We lost your little brother.

01:18:58.550 --> 01:19:01.270
- What?
- Bangkok has him now.

01:19:08.790 --> 01:19:10.110
You gotta take the stairs.

01:19:10.630 --> 01:19:12.150
You're in Bangkok?

01:19:16.630 --> 01:19:18.030
Ooh, that's a finger!

01:19:19.230 --> 01:19:20.470
Put Stu on the phone!

01:19:21.310 --> 01:19:24.710
Bangkok experiences 1500 power outages
per year.

01:19:24.910 --> 01:19:26.990
<i>Stu really doesn't want to talk to anybody.</i>

01:19:27.710 --> 01:19:29.030
<i>- Water everywhere. Powers out.</i>

01:19:29.150 --> 01:19:31.430
<i>Come on, Stu, use that big Jewish brain</i>

01:19:34.070 --> 01:19:36.790
Phil! Give me the phone!

01:19:36.910 --> 01:19:38.670
- It's Lauren! I got it! I'm handling it!
- I know.!

01:19:38.790 --> 01:19:40.510
- Give me the fuckin...
- I can handle it, Stu!

01:19:40.590 --> 01:19:42.070
She's gonna break your heart!

01:19:42.150 --> 01:19:44.510
Honey, sweetheart, it's me! I'm so sorry!

01:19:44.630 --> 01:19:48.270
Stu? What the hell is going on? What does he
mean you lost Teddy?

01:19:48.350 --> 01:19:53.070
What? Is that what Phil said?
No no no. We misplaced, Teddy.

01:19:53.150 --> 01:19:55.750
But we're all good now. We heading back to the
hotel. We're gonna see you soon!

01:19:57.110 --> 01:20:01.910
I love you so much! And I gotta go, but
I'll see you soon. Bye.

01:20:04.950 --> 01:20:05.990
Stu!

01:20:09.310 --> 01:20:10.910
- Stu!
- God!

01:20:12.150 --> 01:20:14.550
Taxi!

01:20:14.790 --> 01:20:16.950
Come on, Alan!

01:20:19.390 --> 01:20:20.910
Hey, you mind filling us in!

01:20:21.150 --> 01:20:23.470
Ok, now when we woke up, the power was out.

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:25.790
And you found Teddy's finger in what?

01:20:25.990 --> 01:20:28.910
- In a pool of water.
- But it didn't start out as water.

01:20:29.070 --> 01:20:30.630
No, it was ice.

01:20:30.750 --> 01:20:32.270
Exactly! Teddy got ice from the machine...

01:20:32.390 --> 01:20:34.910
...came back to the room. Put his finger
on ice and fell asleep.

01:20:34.910 --> 01:20:35.870
Now what do you do if you wake up...

01:20:35.950 --> 01:20:38.510
...and you find your finger floating in
a bowl of melted ice?

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:41.950
I'd get more ice, Stu... on the 15th
fuckin floor!

01:20:42.070 --> 01:20:45.070
Yes! Teddy goes up, the power goes out...

01:20:45.150 --> 01:20:50.230
- Holy shit! Of course!
- He's at the ice machine.

01:20:50.710 --> 01:20:52.390
Alan, no!

01:20:55.550 --> 01:20:56.750
It's on ten!

01:20:57.150 --> 01:20:59.470
- Sir, is the elevator stuck?
- ??.

01:20:59.910 --> 01:21:00.910
- C'mon!
- Go, go, go!

01:21:05.230 --> 01:21:07.270
Hey, Teddy!

01:21:07.630 --> 01:21:09.630
Look out, look out!

01:21:17.950 --> 01:21:19.670
- Teddy!
- You're ok!

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:23.510
Teddy, you okay? You ok, man?

01:21:24.190 --> 01:21:27.150
- Where am I?
- You're in an elevator, in the middle of Bangkok.

01:21:27.390 --> 01:21:29.430
But we're gonna get you outta here. It's
gonna be fine.

01:21:29.670 --> 01:21:32.830
Hey Stu, nice tattoo.

01:21:35.030 --> 01:21:36.110
Thanks, man.

01:21:36.270 --> 01:21:37.670
Alright, let's do this! C'mon, c'mon!

01:21:38.470 --> 01:21:44.870
Tell him we found him.
Yeah, I know. But we're on our way. Ok, bye!

01:21:45.190 --> 01:21:50.230
Alright, guests are arriving, people starting
to ask questions, but we can still pull this off!

01:21:50.350 --> 01:21:52.990
- How?
- I don't know, with a taxi?

01:21:53.070 --> 01:21:54.470
- Chow's speed boat.
- What?

01:21:54.630 --> 01:21:56.790
Last think I remember, was getting off
Chow's speed boat.

01:21:56.910 --> 01:22:00.230
- Chow has a speed boat?
- "The Perfect Life".

01:22:01.390 --> 01:22:02.550
C'mon!

01:22:06.430 --> 01:22:07.750
Stu, get that back line.

01:22:09.990 --> 01:22:11.110
Good jump, Phil!

01:22:13.670 --> 01:22:14.790
- You alright?
- Yeah.

01:22:15.950 --> 01:22:18.790
- You sure you know how to drive this thing?

01:22:18.790 --> 01:22:20.470
Please, I was raised in a yacht club. I
know what I'm doing.

01:22:43.630 --> 01:22:44.870
You know where we're going?

01:22:45.990 --> 01:22:47.670
Leave it to the Captain!

01:22:47.910 --> 01:22:49.630
Oh fuck you, Alan!

01:22:51.230 --> 01:22:54.030
Do you know where we're going, Captain?

01:22:54.950 --> 01:22:57.030
Affirmative cadet!
We're going south.

01:22:57.590 --> 01:23:00.750
- We're in the Gulf of Thailand.
- Good.

01:23:21.870 --> 01:23:23.990
Hey! You okay?

01:23:25.390 --> 01:23:27.710
- Feeling a little better.
- Alright!

01:23:29.110 --> 01:23:33.430
Listen Teddy. I'm really sorry! We didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

01:23:34.230 --> 01:23:43.070
It's funny. I can't remember anything
But... when I woke up, I was kinda happy.

01:23:44.030 --> 01:23:45.270
Yeah!

01:23:46.870 --> 01:23:50.390
By the way... Do you have any idea
where my finger is?

01:23:50.470 --> 01:23:52.750
Yeah, we gave it to a drug dealing
monkey.

01:23:56.310 --> 01:23:57.710
Bangkok...

01:23:58.190 --> 01:24:01.790
Yeah, right... fuckin Bangkok!

01:24:15.270 --> 01:24:17.230
I apologize. There will be no wedding!

01:24:17.350 --> 01:24:19.270
He is on his way. He will be here...

01:24:19.390 --> 01:24:23.550
Please, if you will all move to the bar.
We are going to clear this area.

01:24:23.830 --> 01:24:25.350
Please!

01:24:28.110 --> 01:24:30.430
<i>I'm telling you, I spoke to him. He's coming.</i>

01:24:34.350 --> 01:24:36.510
Look! There they are!

01:24:40.350 --> 01:24:41.590
Stu!

01:24:47.630 --> 01:24:50.230
- Alan, there's no dock.
- Just hang on!

01:24:50.390 --> 01:24:52.990
- Alan, it's not funny! Turn the boat!
- Hang on!

01:24:53.070 --> 01:24:55.190
- Is that Alan driving the boat?
- What?

01:24:55.870 --> 01:24:58.390
Uh, we should probably move back a little bit.

01:24:59.670 --> 01:25:01.710
Oh my god!

01:25:01.830 --> 01:25:03.830
Turn the boat!

01:25:03.950 --> 01:25:05.310
Everyone back up a little bit here.

01:25:05.430 --> 01:25:07.270
Sir, it's gonna get worse before it gets better.

01:25:23.870 --> 01:25:26.350
Hi! Hi everybody!

01:25:28.430 --> 01:25:32.790
Came in a little hotter than we planned.
I'm sorry we trenched the lawn here.

01:25:33.590 --> 01:25:35.790
Totally fixable. A little bit of sod, it'll
be fine.

01:25:35.910 --> 01:25:37.630
- Baby!
- Oh my god!

01:25:37.830 --> 01:25:39.630
I'm so happy to see you!

01:25:41.110 --> 01:25:45.270
- Teddy! Teddy here.
- Hi, Dad!

01:25:46.150 --> 01:25:48.110
- You alright?
- Yeah, ok.

01:25:49.750 --> 01:25:52.350
- Your hand!
- I know.

01:25:52.470 --> 01:25:54.510
We had an accident. I'm ok.

01:25:56.630 --> 01:25:57.670
This is your fault!

01:25:57.830 --> 01:26:02.510
- Dad.
- He's right. I have not been completely honest.

01:26:02.630 --> 01:26:04.030
- Stu? Don't do this.
-Yeah?

01:26:04.150 --> 01:26:05.790
Thanks, Phil, but gonna do it.

01:26:06.910 --> 01:26:11.150
You said I'm a joke.Well I'm not.

01:26:11.710 --> 01:26:18.950
I'm not some weird, milky, ricy, watery
that you feed to infants and old people, ok!

01:26:19.070 --> 01:26:22.830
Maybe I would be if you added some
cayenne pepper!

01:26:25.430 --> 01:26:27.070
I wish I was a boring dentist...

01:26:27.190 --> 01:26:29.230
...who had a boring life and boring friends...

01:26:29.310 --> 01:26:31.070
... but I don't and I'm not.

01:26:31.790 --> 01:26:33.990
I'm actually part of this weird wolf pack.

01:26:34.190 --> 01:26:37.510
It's not weird. It's pretty cool
actually. No membership fees.

01:26:37.590 --> 01:26:39.990
I've had enough of this. Come here.

01:26:40.230 --> 01:26:44.150
Whoa! Here's the deal man.

01:26:44.430 --> 01:26:48.070
- I got a dark side!

01:26:48.150 --> 01:26:50.070
There's a demon in me!

01:26:50.950 --> 01:26:52.870
It's true, he has semen in him.

01:26:53.550 --> 01:26:54.750
I said demon.

01:26:55.270 --> 01:26:59.510
- But you also have semen in you, remember?
- Not relevant, but thank you, Alan.

01:27:01.710 --> 01:27:07.150
The point is, this demon takes me to
some pretty weird places.

01:27:07.350 --> 01:27:10.190
We lost Teddy for two days in Bangkok.

01:27:11.030 --> 01:27:14.870
But that same demon took us to
hell and back to find him.

01:27:14.950 --> 01:27:17.350
We took on Bangkok and we won.

01:27:17.510 --> 01:27:20.070
Now that's pretty fuckin cool if you ask me!

01:27:24.910 --> 01:27:28.910
I love your daughter, and I'm
gonna marry her.

01:27:29.030 --> 01:27:31.270
- Unless you have any problem with that?
- I'm good.

01:27:32.990 --> 01:27:37.710
But all that said, it would actually mean
a great deal to both of us...

01:27:37.950 --> 01:27:40.990
...if we could just get your mother fucking
blessing!

01:27:57.310 --> 01:27:58.590
Hey, Alan...

01:27:59.870 --> 01:28:03.550
- That looks pretty cool shaved.
- Thanks, Phil.

01:28:04.230 --> 01:28:05.750
You should shave your head too.

01:28:06.150 --> 01:28:09.390
- Why would I do that?
- Well than we would look exactly alike.

01:28:20.790 --> 01:28:23.790
- Take good care of my daughter, Stu.
- I will.

01:28:32.150 --> 01:28:34.470
I'm sorry we almost killed everyone with
the boat.

01:28:34.590 --> 01:28:36.070
Just happy you're here.

01:28:39.110 --> 01:28:42.630
And don't worry about the tattoo. I'm gonna
have it lasered as soon as we're home in LA.

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:46.710
- That's ok. I can get used to it.
- Really?

01:28:49.750 --> 01:28:51.550
But for now, let's switch sides?

01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:54.070
- Yeah, ok.
- Thank you.

01:28:55.470 --> 01:28:56.710
Much better.

01:28:58.110 --> 01:29:01.830
Dear family and friends. On behalf of Stu and Lauren...

01:29:01.950 --> 01:29:06.030
...I welcome all of you, to this
marriage celebration.

01:29:06.430 --> 01:29:08.470
We are here today to...

01:30:02.390 --> 01:30:04.750
Hey buddy. Can you hold on for a second.

01:30:05.110 --> 01:30:06.430
Thank you.

01:30:13.750 --> 01:30:16.230
Hello? Hi everyone!

01:30:17.630 --> 01:30:20.110
My name's Alan Garner.

01:30:20.190 --> 01:30:26.390
I want to thank the Asiatic people for
allowing us in your land.

01:30:27.670 --> 01:30:31.790
I wanted to say that, um, I'm really
happy to be here...

01:30:31.910 --> 01:30:35.910
...and I have a wedding gift to present
to Lauren and Stu.

01:30:36.870 --> 01:30:39.590
And um, a lot of thought has gone into this...

01:30:39.710 --> 01:30:44.190
...and I hope that you appreciate it as
much as I did, or going to.

01:30:44.390 --> 01:30:45.790
Okay, guys!

01:31:02.830 --> 01:31:04.270
Oh, fuck!

01:31:24.830 --> 01:31:25.830
Alan!

01:31:28.030 --> 01:31:29.910
What the fuck?

01:31:30.190 --> 01:31:33.390
- So what do ya think?
- That's insane! How did you do that?

01:31:33.470 --> 01:31:35.110
My dad had to make a lot of calls.

01:31:35.230 --> 01:31:38.550
I told Mike that you gotta do it. It's
for my third best friend.

01:31:39.230 --> 01:31:43.150
Alan, it's amazing!
I love it! Thank you so much!

01:31:43.230 --> 01:31:45.950
We only have him for tonight. We don't
have him permanently.

01:31:47.270 --> 01:31:48.830
Understood!

01:32:03.990 --> 01:32:07.590
<i>- You do a lot of public speaking, Alan?
- I barely ??</i>

01:32:08.070 --> 01:32:12.750
Mike, you were great. It's true, that
was incredible.

01:32:12.830 --> 01:32:15.470
Thanks, guys. That means a lot, really!

01:32:15.830 --> 01:32:18.990
By the way, you really need to remove that
fuckin tattoo from your face!

01:32:19.430 --> 01:32:20.910
Yeah! On it!

01:32:23.510 --> 01:32:25.710
Sorry about the last minute change up
to the performance, Mike.

01:32:25.830 --> 01:32:27.430
- Don't worry, Alan.
- What are you talking about?

01:32:27.550 --> 01:32:30.150
Well he was originally supposed to sing
"Burning Up" by the Jonas Brothers...

01:32:30.270 --> 01:32:32.310
...but then I remembered you don't like indie rock.

01:32:33.070 --> 01:32:35.390
Hey guys. You're not gonna believe this.

01:32:35.470 --> 01:32:37.510
- Is that your phone?
- Yeah.

01:32:37.830 --> 01:32:39.710
How come you never tried calling us?

01:32:39.790 --> 01:32:41.470
It's been dead for two days.

01:32:41.590 --> 01:32:43.910
But I recharged it and found all
these photos.

01:32:43.990 --> 01:32:45.150
What?

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:47.350
- Shit!
- Yeah, some of it's pretty messed up.

01:32:47.430 --> 01:32:49.910
- Awesome, let's check em out.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

01:32:50.230 --> 01:32:51.790
No one needs to see this stuff!

01:32:51.910 --> 01:32:54.550
C'mon man! I'm Mike Tyson. I've seen everything!

01:32:54.830 --> 01:32:57.350
