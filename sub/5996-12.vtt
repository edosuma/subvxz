00:01.369 --> 00:02.770
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yo, yo, yo.

00:02.803 --> 00:04.072
Let me catch you up.

00:04.105 --> 00:05.073
You recall that Jane the Virgin

00:05.106 --> 00:06.374
was taught to protect

00:06.407 --> 00:07.375
her flower until marriage.

00:12.513 --> 00:16.050
But lately Jane's been
 rethinking a little,

00:16.084 --> 00:18.819
especially since
 she's single now

00:18.852 --> 00:20.288
and crushing
 on Professor Hottie.

00:20.321 --> 00:23.091
I was wondering if you...

00:23.124 --> 00:25.059
wanted to get dinner sometime.

00:25.093 --> 00:26.294
Yes.

00:26.327 --> 00:27.828
I know-- OMG, right?

00:27.861 --> 00:29.297
Oh, and remember when Petra

00:29.330 --> 00:32.333
inseminated herself
 with Rafael's sperm?

00:32.366 --> 00:34.502
Well, Raf was pretty mad
 at first, but lately,

00:34.535 --> 00:37.338
they've actually been
 growing closer.

00:37.371 --> 00:40.508
And speaking of romance,
 Ro proposed to Xo.

00:40.541 --> 00:42.276
And they would've lived
 happily ever after,

00:42.310 --> 00:43.644
but for this.

00:43.677 --> 00:46.114
I don't want to have
any more kids.

00:46.147 --> 00:47.781
Yeah, so big problemo.

00:47.815 --> 00:48.749
And speaking of problems,

00:48.782 --> 00:50.584
Jane's ex-fiancÃ© Michael

00:50.618 --> 00:52.686
was trying to find
 two crime lords.

00:52.720 --> 00:55.189
Rose aka Sin Rostro,

00:55.223 --> 00:57.358
aka Luisa's great love.

00:57.391 --> 00:59.693
And Elena aka Mutter,

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
aka Rafael's mother.

01:01.762 --> 01:04.098
Turns out they were
 working together

01:04.132 --> 01:05.733
to change criminals' faces.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.801
And they kept all the
 information on a secret chip.

01:07.835 --> 01:09.837
But the cops finally
 got the chip

01:09.870 --> 01:11.172
and decrypted it.

01:11.205 --> 01:12.340
Our first face.

01:12.373 --> 01:13.441
Exciting, right?

01:13.474 --> 01:14.808
So maybe they can use it

01:14.842 --> 01:16.610
to solve this
 friggin' case already.

01:16.644 --> 01:18.579
I know Michael
 certainly wants to.

01:19.880 --> 01:21.615
(doorbell rings)

01:21.649 --> 01:24.885
As you all well know,

01:24.918 --> 01:27.788
our Jane had
 an active imagination.

01:29.257 --> 01:30.391
That, coupled
 with her tendency

01:30.424 --> 01:33.727
to romanticize,

01:33.761 --> 01:35.563
well, it pushed her towards

01:35.596 --> 01:38.232
a certain worldview.

01:38.266 --> 01:42.170
Rosy, if you will.

01:45.639 --> 01:46.874
Ow! Ooh, God!

01:50.944 --> 01:53.581
Hey, maybe we should
go to my place.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.251
But there was one thing
 Jane didn't romanticize.

01:57.285 --> 02:01.155
Uh, so, uh...

02:01.189 --> 02:03.624
it's probably time
that I told you.

02:03.657 --> 02:05.193
What?

02:06.527 --> 02:08.461
I'm a virgin.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.864
Oh.
 Wait for it.

02:10.898 --> 02:14.402
And I'm saving myself
until marriage.

02:14.435 --> 02:17.838
Well, I guess we'll have to wait

02:17.871 --> 02:19.873
till we're married then.

02:23.977 --> 02:27.181
But, alas, that day never came.

02:27.215 --> 02:28.749
Instead, this day came.

02:28.782 --> 02:30.518
Waiting just doesn't
seem to make sense anymore.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.453
I mean, I'm a virgin mom!

02:33.521 --> 02:35.189
That's just weird!

02:35.223 --> 02:36.524
Totally weird.

02:36.557 --> 02:38.192
Like, what exactly
am I holding onto?

02:38.226 --> 02:39.360
No idea.

02:39.393 --> 02:40.594
Because everything
is different now.

02:40.628 --> 02:42.363
Look, trust me,
I get it.

02:42.396 --> 02:44.965
But do you really think that
Professor Hottie is the guy?

02:44.998 --> 02:46.334
I don't know.

02:46.367 --> 02:48.902
I'm just open to it, that's all.

02:50.238 --> 02:52.406
I really feel... open.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.954
Do you have condoms?

03:06.987 --> 03:09.290
Uh, Mom, it's not
happening tonight!

03:09.323 --> 03:10.958
Okay, stop stalling
and go talk to Dad.

03:10.991 --> 03:12.326
All right,
I'm going, I'm going.

03:12.360 --> 03:13.461
Wish me luck.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.964
Hopefully the fact
that I don't want kids

03:16.997 --> 03:18.999
isn't a deal breaker.

03:19.032 --> 03:21.635
I don't want it to be
a deal breaker, either.

03:21.669 --> 03:24.972
So, I guess, how important
are kids to you?

03:25.005 --> 03:27.275
I mean, important.

03:27.308 --> 03:28.842
I didn't get to raise Jane--

03:28.876 --> 03:30.511
Rogelio...
I'm not blaming you.

03:30.544 --> 03:32.280
I mean, this-this
is just coming up,

03:32.313 --> 03:34.382
because now you're
springing this on me.

03:34.415 --> 03:35.716
It's not like I've been
keeping it a secret.

03:35.749 --> 03:37.318
I-I'm just realizing it.

03:37.351 --> 03:38.986
I only wish I'd known.

03:39.019 --> 03:40.854
Yeah, well,
there are things about you

03:40.888 --> 03:42.723
that I wish I knew, too!

03:42.756 --> 03:44.292
Like what?
I'm an open book.

03:44.325 --> 03:48.028
In fact, I gave you
my unauthorized biography.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.564
Well...

03:50.598 --> 03:53.634
what about your
Scientology discs?

03:53.667 --> 03:55.403
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, thank you.

03:55.436 --> 03:57.305
I've been waiting for someone
 to bring that up.

03:57.338 --> 03:59.006
Is that what this is about?

03:59.039 --> 04:00.808
Because you can watch
those discs right now

04:00.841 --> 04:02.310
if that will help.

04:02.343 --> 04:03.944
Great, let's do it!
 I'm in!

04:03.977 --> 04:06.046
No, I'm sorry.
(sighs)

04:06.079 --> 04:07.481
That's not the problem.
 Come on!

04:07.515 --> 04:09.583
I'm lashing out because...

04:09.617 --> 04:12.453
I love you and...

04:12.486 --> 04:14.054
I want to make this work.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.789
Me, too.

04:15.823 --> 04:17.458
(knocking on door)
MAN:
Rehearsal's up, Rogelio.

04:17.491 --> 04:19.392
Coming.

04:19.427 --> 04:21.995
Listen, let's just put the baby
decision on the back burner.

04:22.029 --> 04:25.399
We don't have to decide
that today, right?

04:25.433 --> 04:27.601
You look handsome.

04:27.635 --> 04:29.036
Thank you.

04:29.069 --> 04:30.971
This week, Tiago is going
through the time portal

04:31.004 --> 04:33.507
and arriving in
the women's suffrage movement.

04:33.541 --> 04:36.677
I'm playing the nation's
first male feminist.

04:36.710 --> 04:40.448
I think history has really
overlooked his point of view.

04:44.552 --> 04:47.421
And speaking
 of overlooked heroes...

04:47.455 --> 04:48.956
So...

04:48.989 --> 04:50.591
I'm seeing a clean record here.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.026
Looks like you've never been
in any trouble, Gus.

04:53.060 --> 04:54.862
Nope, never have.

04:54.895 --> 04:57.431
That's why I'm not
exactly sure why I'm here.

04:57.465 --> 04:58.799
That makes two of us.

04:58.832 --> 04:59.967
This guy, on the other hand,

05:00.000 --> 05:02.069
he's been in
lots of trouble.

05:02.102 --> 05:05.072
His name's Igor Beltzky,
Russian mafia.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.375
He's wanted
for drug trafficking,

05:07.408 --> 05:09.777
multiple murder charges,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.945
Yeah, sorry,
I don't know that guy.

05:11.979 --> 05:13.013
MICHAEL:
Interesting.

05:13.046 --> 05:15.649
Because it's you.

05:17.718 --> 05:19.387
Rose and Elena
kept records on a chip--

05:19.420 --> 05:22.690
all the faces they changed,
what they looked like then

05:22.723 --> 05:26.394
and what they look like now.

05:26.427 --> 05:29.463
Is it me or was he
 way cuter before?

05:29.497 --> 05:31.031
So here's what's gonna happen.

05:31.064 --> 05:33.534
You're gonna contact Rose,
however you contacted her,

05:33.567 --> 05:35.369
and you're gonna tell her
you have the chip.

05:35.403 --> 05:37.104
And you're gonna tell her
you'll sell it back to her

05:37.137 --> 05:38.472
And tell her
to come alone.

05:38.506 --> 05:40.040
And for the record,

05:40.073 --> 05:41.742
things would've unfolded
 that way exactly,

05:41.775 --> 05:43.544
but for this.

05:43.577 --> 05:45.713
If the police have the chip,
we both have a problem.

05:45.746 --> 05:48.449
That's right-- Rose and Elena
 knew the cops had it!

05:48.482 --> 05:50.050
But I'm getting
 ahead of myself.

05:50.083 --> 05:51.719
Yeah.

05:51.752 --> 05:54.622
Okay... I'm in.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.156
At this point,
 I should remind you

05:56.189 --> 05:58.091
that this case meant
 everything to Michael.

05:58.125 --> 06:00.894
Because of, well...

06:00.928 --> 06:02.162
Okay!
(kissing)

06:02.195 --> 06:03.731
Come to Daddy!

06:03.764 --> 06:06.166
Thank you for switching nights.
Of course.

06:06.199 --> 06:07.568
But again, I'm getting
 ahead of myself.

06:07.601 --> 06:09.102
Hey, uh, before you go,
do you still have

06:09.136 --> 06:10.638
that list, uh, you made
before you had Mateo

06:10.671 --> 06:12.139
of all the best
baby products?

06:12.172 --> 06:13.974
'Cause Petra's
kind of struggling.

06:14.007 --> 06:15.476
Oh, no, really?

06:15.509 --> 06:16.844
She bought a pram.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.580
A pram as in
an old-timey stroller?

06:19.613 --> 06:21.048
Apparently,
Kate Middleton uses one.

06:21.081 --> 06:22.883
(chuckles)
Around the castle.

06:22.916 --> 06:24.184
I tried
to make suggestions,

06:24.217 --> 06:26.420
but she just kind of
bit my head off.

06:26.454 --> 06:27.888
Yeah, well,
the hormones are crazy

06:27.921 --> 06:29.156
at the end of the pregnancy.

06:29.189 --> 06:30.057
That's what I said.

06:30.090 --> 06:31.492
You called her hormonal?

06:31.525 --> 06:33.060
No.

06:33.093 --> 06:36.029
I just suggested
that she might be...

06:36.063 --> 06:37.197
because she is!

06:37.230 --> 06:39.433
Not the point!
I know.

06:39.467 --> 06:40.868
Hey, you couldn't...?

06:40.901 --> 06:42.903
What?

06:42.936 --> 06:44.438
It's just that she
just looks up to you

06:44.472 --> 06:45.673
with all the mom stuff.

06:45.706 --> 06:48.075
Oh, you want me to talk to her?

06:48.108 --> 06:50.678
Well, we all are
gonna be a family.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.780
You see Michael wasn't
 the only one who knew Jane.

06:52.813 --> 06:54.114
You went there.

06:54.147 --> 06:55.015
I'm not proud of it.

06:55.048 --> 06:56.216
I hate you.

06:56.249 --> 06:57.751
Where is she?

06:57.785 --> 06:58.886
(creaking)

06:58.919 --> 06:59.920
(thump)

07:01.555 --> 07:02.756
JANE:
Oh!
Oh!

07:02.790 --> 07:04.024
Oh, I'm sorry!

07:04.057 --> 07:05.993
Didn't notice you were there.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.828
I was just
looking for Rafael.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.196
He's upstairs.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.998
Ah, shoot.

07:11.031 --> 07:12.966
You know, while I'm here...

07:13.000 --> 07:15.636
Hmm, looks like she's got her
 father's acting chops.

07:15.669 --> 07:18.639
...I, uh, was thinking
maybe we could clear the air.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.941
I-I know the only reason
why you canceled that lunch

07:20.974 --> 07:24.778
was because your mother
murdered that guy.

07:24.812 --> 07:25.979
Yeah.

07:26.013 --> 07:27.147
Sorry about that.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.016
No, it's not your fault.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.651
I mean, my mother does
a lot of stupid stuff, too.

07:30.684 --> 07:34.622
Anyway, uh, you know,
maybe we can have a redo.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.156
Talk about baby stuff...

07:36.189 --> 07:37.791
I'd love that.

07:37.825 --> 07:38.992
Oh, wow, that was quick.

07:39.026 --> 07:40.494
Oh! Okay.

07:40.528 --> 07:42.195
I think I got the
wrong stroller.

07:42.229 --> 07:43.897
Like, this pram won't fold.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.033
Or respond to kicking.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.635
I mean, I could pull up
my baby shower registry.

07:47.668 --> 07:50.003
Oh, that would be great.
I'd just buy everything.

07:50.037 --> 07:51.839
I'm not having a shower.

07:51.872 --> 07:53.741
My mother's in jail, so...

07:53.774 --> 07:54.675
Who would throw it?

07:54.708 --> 07:56.043
Anyway, it's fine.

07:56.076 --> 07:58.211
Ah, yes,
 and now I'll remind you

07:58.245 --> 08:00.080
of Jane's rosy worldview.

08:00.113 --> 08:01.949
I could throw you one,
if you want.

08:01.982 --> 08:03.250
What?

08:03.283 --> 08:04.552
A shower.

08:04.585 --> 08:06.286
(stammers)
A small luncheon.

08:06.319 --> 08:07.788
It's no big deal.

08:07.821 --> 08:09.723
Yeah, we-we can invite...

08:09.757 --> 08:12.660
um... the two women
that you go to yoga with.

08:12.693 --> 08:14.227
And-and the woman
that I met downstairs,

08:14.261 --> 08:15.763
uh, in the lounge.

08:15.796 --> 08:16.964
She doesn't speak English.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.532
Stepanka.

08:18.566 --> 08:19.199
Mm-hmm.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.535
Come on, it'll be nice.

08:21.569 --> 08:24.237
XIOMARA:
 You offered to throw her
 a baby shower?

08:24.271 --> 08:25.238
The better Petra and I
get along,

08:25.272 --> 08:26.640
the better
it'll be for our kids.

08:26.674 --> 08:27.641
Which ones?

08:27.675 --> 08:29.910
Neither.
Higher.

08:29.943 --> 08:31.645
(groans)

08:31.679 --> 08:33.080
I'm impressed.

08:33.113 --> 08:34.815
This is a brand-new Jane.

08:34.847 --> 08:36.249
Friends with Petra,

08:36.283 --> 08:39.653
open to having sex.

08:39.687 --> 08:41.254
Hey.

08:41.288 --> 08:43.155
Just in case.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.225
He's very handsome.

08:45.258 --> 08:46.694
It's not happening tonight!

08:46.727 --> 08:49.029
I'm just getting to know him.

08:49.062 --> 08:52.933
You're very hard
to Internet-stalk.

08:52.966 --> 08:56.036
Privacy-- it's not underrated.

08:56.069 --> 08:58.238
What do you want to know?

08:58.271 --> 09:00.841
Why'd you get a divorce?

09:00.874 --> 09:03.210
I wasn't suited for marriage.

09:03.243 --> 09:04.712
Huh.

09:04.745 --> 09:06.580
I can tell you that I'm

09:06.614 --> 09:08.949
definitely not thinking
about my ex right now.

09:12.119 --> 09:14.354
No, I am completely
rooted here in Miami.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.024
So you wouldn't
take the sabbatical?

09:17.057 --> 09:19.026
Two years in Thailand?

09:19.059 --> 09:21.061
Hmm... no way.

09:21.094 --> 09:22.630
When are you leaving?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.231
Not for four months.

09:24.264 --> 09:25.265
Mm.

09:25.298 --> 09:27.868
Teach till the end
of the semester.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.603
Then relax for the summer.

09:29.637 --> 09:31.271
Then I take off.

09:31.304 --> 09:33.273
Wow.

09:33.306 --> 09:36.276
(Jane laughing)

09:36.309 --> 09:38.378
So you're saying
I'm pretentious.

09:38.411 --> 09:40.113
No!

09:40.147 --> 09:42.215
No, I'm saying that novelas
explore serious themes,

09:42.249 --> 09:44.251
they just don't scream it.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.086
And yes, you are... pret...

09:46.119 --> 09:48.321
(laughs)

09:54.294 --> 09:58.065
MAN:
Um, hey?

09:58.098 --> 09:59.332
We're actually closing.

09:59.366 --> 10:00.668
Oh, sorry.

10:00.701 --> 10:03.003
(chuckles)
We're leaving.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.171
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

10:04.204 --> 10:05.739
(speaks indistinctly)

10:05.773 --> 10:08.241
Come back to my place.

10:08.275 --> 10:10.310
Oh, um,

10:10.343 --> 10:13.246
no, no, not tonight.

10:13.280 --> 10:15.015
Fine.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.017
Tomorrow?

10:17.050 --> 10:18.852
I'll make you dinner.

10:18.886 --> 10:20.954
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, we all know
 what "dinner" means.

10:25.358 --> 10:28.628
Great. Sounds perfect.

10:33.266 --> 10:36.970
He's just... the perfect
person to do this with.

10:37.004 --> 10:39.139
I mean, first of all,
I'm extremely attracted to him.

10:39.172 --> 10:40.240
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I'll say.

10:40.273 --> 10:42.209
Yes, you've made that clear.

10:42.242 --> 10:44.211
Plus he's leaving the country,
so there's no time for me

10:44.244 --> 10:46.113
to romanticize the whole thing
and get attached.

10:46.146 --> 10:48.749
At this point, I just want
to get it over with.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.117
You know, rip off
the Band-Aid already,

10:50.150 --> 10:52.119
so it's not such a huge thing.
Got it.

10:52.152 --> 10:54.421
So, you gonna tell him
it's your first time?

10:54.454 --> 10:56.256
No, there's no need.

10:56.289 --> 10:58.692
Then it's suddenly deep,
and it's not.

11:02.129 --> 11:03.764
Jonathan. There's
no real future there.

11:03.797 --> 11:05.065
(chuckles)

11:05.098 --> 11:07.300
Okay, you two, I got
to go to school. Bye.

11:07.334 --> 11:09.136
Give me a ride.
I'm meeting Rogelio.

11:09.169 --> 11:10.971
Bye, Ma.

11:11.004 --> 11:12.372
Bye.

11:12.405 --> 11:15.275
*

11:17.510 --> 11:19.479
(knocking on door)

11:19.512 --> 11:22.082
Xiomara, thank you for coming.

11:22.115 --> 11:23.717
Are you okay?
Yes.

11:23.751 --> 11:25.719
I have decided...

11:25.753 --> 11:27.187
Please come in.

11:29.356 --> 11:31.391
Sit.

11:31.424 --> 11:34.194
I know you said
this wasn't the issue,

11:34.227 --> 11:37.230
but if these Scientology discs
are holding you back in any way,

11:37.264 --> 11:38.465
I want to show
them to you.

11:38.498 --> 11:40.467
Oh, no, that's not necessary.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.335
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Shut it, Xo.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.104
Please, I insist.

11:44.137 --> 11:46.106
Sure, if you really want to.

11:56.449 --> 11:58.051
Okay, fine.

11:58.085 --> 11:59.486
Here it is.

11:59.519 --> 12:03.323
I was 26 years old,
and a friend was setting me up.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.926
She said she wanted
to find me a girlfriend.

12:05.959 --> 12:07.928
She was an older woman.

12:07.961 --> 12:10.530
And I thought she liked
to be called "madam"

12:10.563 --> 12:14.534
as a sign of respect,
but that wasn't the only reason.

12:14.567 --> 12:15.969
She was also...

12:16.003 --> 12:16.970
LUCIANA:
What?

12:17.004 --> 12:19.106
...an actual madam.

12:19.139 --> 12:20.307
But I didn't know.

12:20.340 --> 12:22.509
It wasn't until I watch
the acclaimed film Pretty Woman

12:22.542 --> 12:27.881
that I realized
I was a "pretty woman."

12:29.016 --> 12:29.983
Well, now you know.

12:30.017 --> 12:30.984
It was 15 years ago.

12:31.018 --> 12:32.419
It's so embarrassing.

12:37.490 --> 12:38.892
That's the big secret?

12:40.227 --> 12:43.496
Rogelio, honestly, I don't care.

12:43.530 --> 12:46.566
I was imagining
something way worse.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.969
Really? Luciana hung that
over my head.

12:49.002 --> 12:50.804
How many times
do I have to tell you?

12:50.838 --> 12:52.005
I'm not Luciana.

12:52.039 --> 12:55.375
No, you're not.

12:59.246 --> 13:02.049
It's finally been set.

13:02.082 --> 13:05.118
Xiomara, be my wife.

13:05.152 --> 13:06.553
Please.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.922
I know, no kids,
and I'm okay with that.

13:08.956 --> 13:12.325
I'd rather have you
than some hypothetical

13:12.359 --> 13:14.161
genetically blessed kid.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.405
PETRA:
 That thing is huge.

13:25.438 --> 13:27.607
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ah, yes, these two were
 also giving it a try.

13:27.640 --> 13:29.609
I know, but that is
the best breast pump

13:29.642 --> 13:31.311
because it comes
with an extra battery.

13:31.344 --> 13:32.946
Yeah, I won't need it.

13:32.980 --> 13:34.314
Oh, trust me.
(chuckles)

13:34.347 --> 13:35.615
I forgot my battery, and I was
at this writer's retreat,

13:35.648 --> 13:37.150
and then Raf had
to bring it to me,

13:37.184 --> 13:39.452
and it was just, like,
this whole big thing.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.154
No, I won't be needing it,
'cause I'm not breast-feeding.

13:41.188 --> 13:43.590
Oh.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.426
I'm having two babies,
Jane. That's a lot.

13:46.459 --> 13:48.261
No, I get that, I-I'm...
I'm not judging.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.262
Oh.

13:49.296 --> 13:51.098
Felt like judging.

13:51.131 --> 13:53.600
Sorry. Totally didn't
mean that at all.

13:53.633 --> 13:56.870
Anyway, um, Raf and I
have this glider.

13:56.904 --> 13:59.106
We love it because
it is so comfortable,

13:59.139 --> 14:01.508
especially if you're gonna be up
long nights, feeding the baby...

14:01.541 --> 14:03.243
I'm not worried
about late nights.

14:03.276 --> 14:05.078
I have a night nurse.

14:05.112 --> 14:08.115
Oh, well, maybe
she wants to sit in it.

14:10.450 --> 14:11.418
I just don't like it.

14:11.451 --> 14:12.652
Okay.
Okay?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.254
I think gliders are
ugly in general.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.388
Okay, got it.

14:15.422 --> 14:16.890
WAITRESS:
Here you go.

14:16.924 --> 14:18.525
Your oil.

14:18.558 --> 14:19.526
And your water.

14:19.559 --> 14:21.528
Thank you.

14:21.561 --> 14:23.530
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Huh. Perhaps I've romanticized

14:23.563 --> 14:26.099
their friendship potential
 just a little.

14:26.133 --> 14:27.534
So, pacifiers?

14:27.567 --> 14:29.002
Oh, yes, definitely
pacifiers.

14:29.036 --> 14:30.637
Wait, how about those?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.072
Two for $12?

14:32.105 --> 14:33.473
No, that's ridiculous.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.608
Lookit, five for ten.
Yeah.

14:35.642 --> 14:37.444
But don't you think there's a
reason for the price difference?

14:37.477 --> 14:39.079
Yeah, they're trying
to scam you.
Or they're better.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.313
Maybe.
Definitely.

14:40.347 --> 14:41.414
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Yeah.

14:41.448 --> 14:43.416
Not quite so rosy in real life.

14:43.450 --> 14:44.451
JANE:
 I was trying.

14:44.484 --> 14:46.286
But Petra is so...

14:46.319 --> 14:47.620
Judgy.

14:47.654 --> 14:49.622
Seriously, Jane's judgy.

14:49.656 --> 14:51.925
She was buying all these
overpriced impractical things

14:51.959 --> 14:53.961
just because they were
more expensive.

14:53.994 --> 14:56.930
She made me feel bad for wanting
the best things for our kids.

14:56.964 --> 14:57.998
And you should have
heard her talking

14:58.031 --> 14:59.299
about around-the-clock nannies.

14:59.332 --> 15:01.301
And she's such a martyr.

15:01.334 --> 15:03.003
She has to do
everything herself.

15:03.036 --> 15:05.005
Whatever. We're just
really different.

15:05.038 --> 15:06.706
Oil and water. Honestly.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.141
Enough, Petra.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.377
We just wanted to help.
"We"?

15:12.712 --> 15:15.682
Okay, I might have... told Jane

15:15.715 --> 15:17.684
you needed a little help.

15:17.717 --> 15:20.053
I don't need help.

15:22.522 --> 15:24.491
It's too late now, I
already said I would.

15:24.524 --> 15:26.393
I just got to get through this.

15:45.245 --> 15:47.047
Cut!

15:47.080 --> 15:50.217
Now let's move on to Tiago
making love in the voting booth.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.019
Yes.

15:52.052 --> 15:53.686
Oh, hi! Come.

15:53.720 --> 15:55.688
I'm so glad you're here.

15:55.722 --> 15:58.425
Suffragettes,
gather round, please.

15:58.458 --> 16:00.360
I want to make an announcement.

16:00.393 --> 16:02.762
The beautiful woman
standing next to me

16:02.795 --> 16:05.765
is going to be Mrs. de la Vega.

16:05.798 --> 16:07.034
(whooping)

16:07.067 --> 16:08.501
Uh, unless I keep my name.

16:08.535 --> 16:10.503
(laughing):
Why would you do that?

16:10.537 --> 16:11.971
That's ridiculous.

16:16.543 --> 16:18.511
Mr. de la Vega, can I
take a picture with you?

16:18.545 --> 16:19.979
For my mom?
Of course.

16:21.248 --> 16:22.649
Wait, first,

16:22.682 --> 16:24.051
find your light.

16:24.084 --> 16:26.053
And then hold
the camera up high

16:26.086 --> 16:28.355
to streamline your features.

16:28.388 --> 16:29.689
(camera clicks)
Yes.

16:29.722 --> 16:31.124
BOY: Thank you,
Mr. de la Vega.

16:31.158 --> 16:32.559
ROGELIO:
Sure.

16:34.194 --> 16:36.796
Rogelio, are you sure
this is what you want?

16:36.829 --> 16:38.198
A life without kids?

16:38.231 --> 16:41.034
No, I'm not.

16:41.068 --> 16:42.735
But I'm sure about you.

16:42.769 --> 16:44.471
And who knows?

16:44.504 --> 16:47.140
Perhaps in the future
you'll change your mind.

16:47.174 --> 16:48.308
What?

16:48.341 --> 16:49.409
You did before.

16:49.442 --> 16:51.111
It's a possibility.

16:51.144 --> 16:53.746
But I'm 40.

16:53.780 --> 16:55.782
I-I can't even have
kids much longer.

16:55.815 --> 16:57.784
Yes, I know.

16:57.817 --> 17:00.820
*

17:00.853 --> 17:04.723
What if we could
manipulate time?

17:04.757 --> 17:08.661
Xiomara, will you consider
freezing your eggs?

17:08.694 --> 17:11.664
Just as an insurance
policy, in case.

17:11.698 --> 17:16.368
Uh, I guess I could
think about it.

17:18.105 --> 17:19.606
JONATHAN:
 It's all about the eggs.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.808
You have to make sure
they're at room temperature.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.844
'Cause if they're too cold,
they won't mix with the flour.

17:24.877 --> 17:26.679
Delicious.

17:26.713 --> 17:28.681
I've never had
a homemade pasta before.

17:28.715 --> 17:30.683
Oh, I'm glad
you liked it.

17:30.717 --> 17:32.119
I did.

17:32.152 --> 17:33.620
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Let's be real.

17:33.653 --> 17:35.655
No one is thinking
 about pasta right now.

17:42.895 --> 17:46.099
And this, my friends,
 is what we call "chemistry."

17:51.138 --> 17:53.106
Just so you know.
Mm-hmm.

17:53.140 --> 17:54.807
You're the first person
I've been with.

17:54.841 --> 17:56.109
You've got to be kidding me.

17:56.143 --> 17:58.811
I mean, since my divorce
was finalized.

17:58.845 --> 18:00.713
Oh, okay, that makes
 more sense.

18:00.747 --> 18:02.815
I mean, not a big deal,
I'm just mentioning it.

18:02.849 --> 18:05.485
Got it.

18:16.196 --> 18:18.165
You know what else
is not a big deal?

18:18.198 --> 18:19.699
Wait, I thought
 we weren't telling.

18:19.732 --> 18:21.901
You are actually my first.

18:21.934 --> 18:23.303
That's it, buddy.

18:23.336 --> 18:24.737
That's the end of the sentence.

18:24.771 --> 18:26.139
I'm a virgin.

18:26.173 --> 18:27.740
Oh.

18:27.774 --> 18:29.476
But also not a big deal.

18:29.509 --> 18:31.478
It was just, like, a promise
I made to my grandmother. Yeah.

18:31.511 --> 18:33.313
(chuckling): Your...
your grandmother?

18:33.346 --> 18:34.781
Oh, Jane.

18:34.814 --> 18:36.816
I just mean that I was saving
myself for marriage,

18:36.849 --> 18:38.251
but now I'm not.

18:38.285 --> 18:39.719
So...

18:39.752 --> 18:41.721
Oh, no, did I ruin the mood?

18:41.754 --> 18:44.924
Not the stuff
about being a virgin.

18:44.957 --> 18:48.161
Maybe all the talk
about your grandmother.

18:48.195 --> 18:51.398
Look, I'm just looking
for something casual.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.233
Oh.

18:53.266 --> 18:56.836
So am I, so...

18:56.869 --> 18:57.837
Jane.

18:57.870 --> 18:59.839
Mm-hmm?

18:59.872 --> 19:01.808
M-Maybe we
shouldn't do this.

19:01.841 --> 19:04.311
I'm sorry.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.345
No.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.347
Gotcha.

19:07.380 --> 19:09.182
No problem.

19:09.216 --> 19:10.617
It's cool.

19:16.223 --> 19:17.590
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall we left Xiomara

19:17.624 --> 19:20.393
considering a certain
 fertility treatment.

19:20.427 --> 19:22.262
(clears throat)

19:22.295 --> 19:23.196
Were you waiting up for me?

19:23.230 --> 19:25.265
No.

19:26.266 --> 19:28.268
Are you still...?
Yes.

19:28.301 --> 19:30.270
I didn't have sex.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.273
For some reason, I told
him I was a virgin,

19:33.306 --> 19:35.275
and soon we were
talking about Abuela.

19:35.308 --> 19:36.743
Ooh.
Yeah.

19:36.776 --> 19:38.578
He pulled the plug.

19:38.611 --> 19:41.714
I mean, if he hadn't,
I would have done it.

19:41.748 --> 19:43.550
Maybe.

19:43.583 --> 19:45.385
Or maybe you brought up
the virgin thing

19:45.418 --> 19:46.919
because you weren't sure?

19:46.953 --> 19:48.788
What? No.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.992
JANE:
Oh, nothing.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.827
It was just
a bad date.

19:54.861 --> 19:57.297
Uh, I do have some
pretty big news, though.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.598
Mm-hmm?

19:58.631 --> 20:00.700
I might freeze my eggs.

20:03.870 --> 20:06.239
As in get them
removed and frozen.

20:06.273 --> 20:08.741
In case I change my mind
about having kids.

20:08.775 --> 20:09.942
Huh.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.912
Just to leave the door open.

20:12.945 --> 20:15.748
Okay, so he'll just
open the door,

20:15.782 --> 20:16.749
and I'll apologize.

20:16.783 --> 20:18.751
For keeping in touch

20:18.785 --> 20:21.788
with the woman who killed our
father and kidnapped his son.

20:30.397 --> 20:31.764
SUSANNA:
Perfect.

20:31.798 --> 20:32.999
Just be
straightforward.

20:33.032 --> 20:34.601
You can do this.

20:34.634 --> 20:36.035
I can do this.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.270
RAFAEL:
 You did it.

20:37.304 --> 20:38.538
You apologized.

20:38.571 --> 20:40.373
So now you can go.
Rafael.

20:40.407 --> 20:42.809
You chose to stay in touch with
Rose instead of turning her in.

20:44.811 --> 20:46.779
You need to
understand.

20:46.813 --> 20:49.616
Uh... I'm an
addict, right?

20:49.649 --> 20:51.451
And-and I've
been sober,

20:51.484 --> 20:55.288
but in some way, I've replaced
one addiction with another,

20:55.322 --> 20:57.757
and... and alcohol
became Rose.

20:57.790 --> 20:59.592
I mean, even with
all that bad stuff,

20:59.626 --> 21:01.428
I just, I was obsessed.

21:01.461 --> 21:03.396
I just couldn't let her go.

21:04.531 --> 21:06.999
Does this make any sense?

21:07.033 --> 21:09.302
No.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.039
You should leave.

21:19.546 --> 21:21.548
*

21:28.087 --> 21:29.522
JANE:
 Knock, knock.

21:29.556 --> 21:31.924
I'm in the middle
of something.

21:31.958 --> 21:33.426
I'm sorry, it's just...

21:33.460 --> 21:34.594
you haven't
returned my calls or texts.

21:35.795 --> 21:37.029
I just wanted to know

21:37.063 --> 21:38.365
if the tea sandwiches are a go.

21:38.398 --> 21:40.032
Kate Middleton's favorites.

21:40.066 --> 21:42.034
Jane, just spare me. Okay?

21:42.068 --> 21:43.069
What?

21:43.102 --> 21:44.937
I don't need your pity party.

21:44.971 --> 21:47.440
This is not
a pity party.

21:48.875 --> 21:51.010
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Stay put, Jane.

21:51.043 --> 21:52.412
Resist the urge to help.

21:52.445 --> 21:55.415
Look... I know that
you and Rafael

21:55.448 --> 21:57.116
were plotting how
to help me, okay?

21:57.149 --> 21:59.386
I should have realized it, the
way you were talking yesterday.

21:59.419 --> 22:00.853
"We" this, "we" that.

22:00.887 --> 22:03.356
No, no, it wasn't
like that.

22:03.390 --> 22:04.824
I mean, we're close,
that's all;

22:04.857 --> 22:06.426
we're raising
a kid together.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.994
He mentions things.

22:08.027 --> 22:08.995
That's it?

22:09.028 --> 22:10.663
Of course.

22:10.697 --> 22:12.399
Got it.

22:13.800 --> 22:15.602
Oh, we kissed.

22:15.635 --> 22:17.136
Did he mention that?

22:17.169 --> 22:19.506
No, he didn't.

22:19.539 --> 22:20.673
Well, we did.

22:20.707 --> 22:23.976
Wait, is that
what this is about?

22:24.010 --> 22:26.112
Do you think that
I want to be with him?

22:26.145 --> 22:27.847
Well, do you?

22:27.880 --> 22:29.649
No, I don't.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.083
Does he know that?

22:31.117 --> 22:32.985
Of course.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.392
(knocking at door)

22:39.426 --> 22:40.960
Hey, he's still sleeping.

22:40.993 --> 22:43.162
He'll be up any minute.

22:43.195 --> 22:44.797
Is everything okay?

22:44.831 --> 22:47.634
Apparently, Petra knew
that you sent me in.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.168
(sighs)

22:49.201 --> 22:50.637
Shoot.

22:50.670 --> 22:53.973
I meant to tell you...

22:54.006 --> 22:55.408
And did you mean

22:55.442 --> 22:56.709
to tell me about the kiss?

22:58.210 --> 23:00.046
I mean, I just wouldn't
have mentioned your name

23:00.079 --> 23:02.048
so many times, had I known.

23:02.081 --> 23:03.416
I don't know
why I didn't.

23:03.450 --> 23:05.985
Okay.

23:06.018 --> 23:07.454
Well, Petra said...

23:07.487 --> 23:08.755
That's not true,
I do know why.

23:08.788 --> 23:11.123
It's 'cause I still
love you, Jane, I do.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.828
And I'm sorry
that I lied to you,

23:15.862 --> 23:18.731
it's just that we were in such
a good place before that

23:18.765 --> 23:20.166
and I just want
to get back to that.

23:20.199 --> 23:21.634
We can't.

23:21.668 --> 23:22.902
We can.

23:22.935 --> 23:24.471
W... I won't lie again.

23:24.504 --> 23:25.672
It's not about the lie.

23:25.705 --> 23:26.939
We're just so different.

23:26.973 --> 23:28.475
Then we'll learn
how to compromise.

23:28.508 --> 23:30.009
Rafael, stop...
Fighting?
I-I can't,

23:30.042 --> 23:32.479
'cause I don't understand, Jane.
We were in love.

23:32.512 --> 23:34.747
We were. But...

23:34.781 --> 23:37.149
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And she knew she couldn't
 leave the door open.

23:37.183 --> 23:39.519
...my feelings
changed.

23:39.552 --> 23:41.187
I-I don't know when,

23:41.220 --> 23:42.822
but they changed

23:42.855 --> 23:44.491
and that's why
we aren't together.

23:44.524 --> 23:46.526
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And strangely, in this moment,

23:46.559 --> 23:48.795
his sister's words
 came to mind.

23:52.799 --> 23:54.166
Okay.

23:55.802 --> 23:57.704
Yeah, I got it.

24:05.044 --> 24:06.145
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You know what you should do

24:06.178 --> 24:08.515
if you share a baby daddy
 and months of animosity?

24:08.548 --> 24:11.017
Exactly!

24:11.050 --> 24:12.785
Throw a baby shower!

24:12.819 --> 24:14.186
(laughter, chatter)

24:22.294 --> 24:23.863
XIOMARA:
Sorry I'm late.

24:23.896 --> 24:26.032
Nah, don't worry,

24:26.065 --> 24:27.634
Petra's not even
here yet.

24:27.667 --> 24:29.702
So, how was
the fertility doctor?

24:29.736 --> 24:31.771
I learned I have
"geriatric eggs."

24:31.804 --> 24:33.573
Oh...
Seriously.

24:33.606 --> 24:35.041
That's what they're called
if you're over 35.

24:35.074 --> 24:37.109
But because of
where I am in my cycle,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.078
I can start injections

24:39.111 --> 24:41.113
tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

24:41.147 --> 24:43.115
Which she recommends,
because of the geriatric thing.

24:43.149 --> 24:45.618
Wow, okay.

24:45.652 --> 24:47.720
How do you feel
about that, Mateo, huh? Huh?

24:47.754 --> 24:50.623
You want another baby? Huh?

24:50.657 --> 24:52.224
Ooh, somebody's wet.

24:52.258 --> 24:53.092
Let's go change you.

24:53.125 --> 24:54.561
Let me. I want to.

24:54.594 --> 24:55.962
Okay...

24:55.995 --> 24:57.764
All done.

24:57.797 --> 24:59.265
Nice and clean.

24:59.298 --> 25:01.100
Yes.

25:01.133 --> 25:03.235
Who's my perfect boy?

25:03.269 --> 25:05.104
I love you.

25:05.137 --> 25:06.272
Yes, I do,

25:06.305 --> 25:08.941
I love you, Mateo.

25:10.577 --> 25:11.911
(sighs)

25:15.047 --> 25:16.148
(sighs)

25:24.323 --> 25:26.125
Why aren't you downstairs?

25:26.158 --> 25:28.695
I thought I made myself clear.
I didn't want the shower.

25:28.728 --> 25:30.897
Um, no, no.
You did not make that clear.

25:30.930 --> 25:33.199
And the shower is happening.
Right now.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.200
Okay, well, I'm not going.

25:34.233 --> 25:35.868
What? You have to.

25:35.902 --> 25:37.103
No, I don't.

25:37.136 --> 25:39.939
Jane, we don't like each other.

25:39.972 --> 25:41.207
And I don't need

25:41.240 --> 25:42.742
your sympathy, okay?

25:42.775 --> 25:44.243
I know you pity me
and my screwed-up family and...

25:44.276 --> 25:45.945
This isn't because of
your screwed-up family,

25:45.978 --> 25:47.580
it's because of mine. Okay?

25:47.614 --> 25:49.248
I just got to know my dad,

25:49.281 --> 25:51.250
and my grandma doesn't talk
to her relatives in Venezuela,

25:51.283 --> 25:53.252
and it was just the three of us,
a lot of the time.

25:53.285 --> 25:54.887
And that was lonely.

25:54.921 --> 25:56.923
And I don't want that
for my son.

25:58.124 --> 26:00.226
I didn't know that.

26:00.259 --> 26:01.628
You tend to...

26:01.661 --> 26:02.895
Romanticize. I know.

26:02.929 --> 26:04.263
Well...

26:04.296 --> 26:05.932
I do feel better

26:05.965 --> 26:07.199
knowing you've suffered
a little.

26:08.167 --> 26:09.168
What? I like honesty.

26:09.201 --> 26:10.837
So do I.

26:10.870 --> 26:12.304
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 At last.

26:12.338 --> 26:13.706
Something they have in common.

26:13.740 --> 26:15.141
Then, honestly,

26:15.174 --> 26:16.976
I don't react well
to being handled.

26:17.009 --> 26:18.645
I get that.

26:18.678 --> 26:20.046
And honestly, I don't
respond well to snobbery.

26:20.079 --> 26:21.881
And I don't like it
when people are fake.

26:21.914 --> 26:23.950
Part of the reason I didn't
want to go to the shower

26:23.983 --> 26:25.184
was because I didn't
want to hear you

26:25.217 --> 26:26.352
give some insincere toast.

26:26.385 --> 26:28.187
Good.

26:28.220 --> 26:29.856
'Cause I didn't want to give it.

26:32.324 --> 26:34.961
Now... can we go down?

26:34.994 --> 26:36.663
To Petra.

26:36.696 --> 26:38.831
She's...

26:40.066 --> 26:42.234
...having two babies.

26:44.303 --> 26:46.072
GUS:
 Careful there, baby...

26:46.105 --> 26:49.208
Can I take you to dinner later?
No.

26:49.241 --> 26:51.143
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I think he's forgetting
 about his new face.

26:51.177 --> 26:53.212
And that she's a lesbian.

26:53.245 --> 26:55.247
And that he's killed,
 like, 32 people.

26:55.281 --> 26:57.183
You're gonna wait for Rose
in the warehouse.

26:57.216 --> 27:00.019
When you exchange the chip
for the money, we move in.

...but I'm getting
 ahead of myself.
Cordero.

27:06.693 --> 27:07.994
What?

27:08.027 --> 27:09.428
What's wrong?

27:09.461 --> 27:11.798
Luisa was drinking.

27:11.831 --> 27:13.265
She was in
 a really bad car crash.

27:13.299 --> 27:16.068

 Is she okay?

27:16.102 --> 27:17.837
Is Luisa okay?

27:17.870 --> 27:19.238
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And I'd tell you the answer

27:19.271 --> 27:21.240
to that, friend, but again...

27:21.273 --> 27:23.209
I don't want to get
 ahead of myself.

27:27.446 --> 27:29.381
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 You'll recall, Luisa was taken

27:29.415 --> 27:31.217
to the hospital in a stretcher,

27:31.250 --> 27:32.752
but Jane knew nothing of that.

27:32.785 --> 27:34.120
Or she wouldn't be doing this.

 Professor Hottie.

27:54.406 --> 27:55.875
Don't sugarcoat, Jane.

27:55.908 --> 27:57.810
Ugh.

28:30.476 --> 28:32.879
*

28:32.912 --> 28:36.015
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 I believe the term here
 is "sexting."

28:40.186 --> 28:43.055
It should be noted

28:43.089 --> 28:46.425
that when two professional
 writers decide to sext,

28:46.458 --> 28:48.327
it gets very hot, very quickly.

28:52.164 --> 28:53.465
(shudders)

29:01.040 --> 29:02.909
It should also be noted

29:02.942 --> 29:04.844
that our Jane's driving
 just a little too fast...

29:04.877 --> 29:08.915
and also
 she's not wearing pants.

What?

29:22.461 --> 29:23.462
Yes.

29:25.497 --> 29:26.899
Hello.

29:26.933 --> 29:29.268
Everything okay?
Oh, yeah.

29:29.301 --> 29:30.937
Because you have
a lot of papers on your lap.

29:30.970 --> 29:33.272
I do.

29:33.305 --> 29:36.408
Because, um...

29:36.442 --> 29:38.845
I'm not wearing any pants.

29:38.878 --> 29:40.312
It's a long story.

29:40.346 --> 29:41.580
I'm sure it is.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.215
You were also speeding.

29:43.249 --> 29:44.450
Related to the pants.

29:44.483 --> 29:45.985
License and
registration.

29:46.018 --> 29:47.353
Yes, of course, I'm sorry.

29:54.460 --> 29:56.328
Ow! Ooh, ay, ay, ay...

29:56.362 --> 29:57.496
Sorry.

29:57.529 --> 29:58.965
(gasps)

29:58.998 --> 30:00.332
Don't have sex.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.369
I said, don't speed.

30:05.337 --> 30:06.438
Right.

30:06.472 --> 30:08.007
I'm so sorry.

30:08.040 --> 30:11.177
I'm gonna let you off
with a warning.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.212
But drive safely.

30:13.245 --> 30:14.580
Think first.

30:19.952 --> 30:21.287
Oh, God,

30:21.320 --> 30:23.222
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I was speeding and...

30:23.255 --> 30:25.191
I want you
so badly.

30:31.197 --> 30:32.398
Come on, let's go
to the bedroom.

30:32.431 --> 30:34.333
(whimpers)

30:34.366 --> 30:36.235
Hey. Are you okay?

30:36.268 --> 30:37.303
Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine.

30:37.336 --> 30:38.570
Okay.
I'm fine.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.376
(sobs)
Hey...

30:46.078 --> 30:47.313
J... You're-you're crying.

30:47.346 --> 30:49.215
No, I'm not crying.

30:49.248 --> 30:51.350
(crying):
I'm not cry...

30:51.383 --> 30:53.185
I'm not crying.

30:53.219 --> 30:55.287
I'm fine.
I really want to do this.

30:55.321 --> 30:56.923
I really do...

30:56.956 --> 30:59.191
Jane...
I'm sorry, I think
I'm just, like,

30:59.225 --> 31:01.193
a little overwhelmed,
but I'm fine.

31:01.227 --> 31:03.195
I still really want
to do this, I do.

31:03.229 --> 31:05.364
I think I just need
to blow my nose.

31:05.397 --> 31:06.565
Yeah.
Okay.

31:08.968 --> 31:10.236
Here.

31:10.269 --> 31:11.470
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Ugh, what a mess.

31:11.503 --> 31:13.039
Okay.

31:13.072 --> 31:14.040
(crying):
Okay, great.

31:14.073 --> 31:15.307
It's okay,
don't worry.

31:15.341 --> 31:17.910
No... no,
I really might want to.

31:19.011 --> 31:20.947
Oh...
It's okay.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.415
I've been
waiting for you.

31:23.449 --> 31:25.051
Oh, sorry, sorry,
I grabbed your keys,

31:25.084 --> 31:27.319
I didn't think
you were gonna go out.

31:27.353 --> 31:29.055
It's the first night
of the hormone shots.

31:29.088 --> 31:30.422
Ro wants to be with me...

31:30.456 --> 31:31.657
Whose pants are those?

31:31.690 --> 31:34.160
Jonathan's.

31:34.193 --> 31:35.427
I went to his house
to have sex with him,

31:35.461 --> 31:36.628
and instead I burst into tears.
No.

31:36.662 --> 31:39.198
Yes.
You cried?

31:39.231 --> 31:41.133
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Oh, she definitely cried.
I didn't mean to.

31:41.167 --> 31:42.434
Like, actual tears?

31:42.468 --> 31:44.336
Okay, now you're just making me
feel worse!

31:44.370 --> 31:46.372
Uh, anyway, Mom, um, bye.

31:46.405 --> 31:49.241
Tell Dad I said hi and thank you
for watching the baby.

31:49.275 --> 31:50.276
Bye, Ma.

31:50.309 --> 31:51.677
Uh, let me go change, Abuela.

31:51.710 --> 31:54.346
And then we can catch
up on our novelas.

31:55.681 --> 31:58.450
ROGELIO:
 Telenovelas need heart.

31:58.484 --> 32:01.487
But they also need a big,
fun action sequence.

32:01.520 --> 32:03.322
That's why we're
putting Susan B. Anthony

32:03.355 --> 32:04.623
in a freak riding accident.

32:04.656 --> 32:06.692
(screams)

32:09.295 --> 32:11.730
Plus, it's an old trick.

32:11.763 --> 32:14.133
A woman in distress really
brings everyone together

32:14.166 --> 32:16.268
at the end of an episode.

32:16.302 --> 32:19.138
(steady beeping)

32:19.171 --> 32:21.207
But I'm getting ahead of myself.
WOMAN: Shh!

32:21.240 --> 32:22.274
Lecture the intern
somewhere else.

32:22.308 --> 32:23.475
We're rolling.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.214
Xiomara!
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Shh!

32:28.247 --> 32:30.616
We must be very quiet,
 because we are now

32:30.649 --> 32:33.052
in the midst
 of an official telenovela

32:33.085 --> 32:35.054
action sequence.

32:35.087 --> 32:37.089
Gus looks nervous,
 which makes sense,

32:37.123 --> 32:39.258
because he's waiting
 to meet Rose.

32:43.262 --> 32:45.064
Is that her?

32:45.097 --> 32:47.266
(whistling)

32:49.301 --> 32:50.302
(exhales)

32:50.336 --> 32:52.371
Come on, come on, come on!

32:52.404 --> 32:53.439
(thud nearby)

32:53.472 --> 32:56.275
This is it-- she's coming.

33:05.584 --> 33:07.719
Rose.

33:07.753 --> 33:10.289
Your face.

33:10.322 --> 33:11.723
It's the same.

33:11.757 --> 33:14.226
Would you repaint
the Sistine Chapel?

33:14.260 --> 33:16.028
(laughs)

33:16.062 --> 33:18.264
I had to make sure
you were all right.

33:18.297 --> 33:20.232
(sniffles)

33:20.266 --> 33:22.701
And I also came here
to say good-bye.

33:22.734 --> 33:24.270
What?

33:24.303 --> 33:26.038
You need to move on.

33:26.072 --> 33:27.139
There's no future for us.

33:27.173 --> 33:28.307
Why?

33:28.340 --> 33:30.109
Don't say that.

33:30.142 --> 33:32.378
Luisa, you're not gonna
run away with me.

33:32.411 --> 33:35.047
I mean...

33:35.081 --> 33:36.548
I could.

33:40.186 --> 33:43.122
Okay, she's
getting ready to move.

33:43.155 --> 33:45.257
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 Okay, finally, I'm not
 getting ahead of myself.

33:45.291 --> 33:47.226
Let me fill you in.

33:47.259 --> 33:49.495
Remember how Rose and Elena
 knew the cops found the chip?

33:49.528 --> 33:52.198
If the police have the chip,
we both have a problem.

33:52.231 --> 33:54.100
Well, Michael knew they knew!

33:54.133 --> 33:55.134
I'm guessing there's a signal

33:55.167 --> 33:56.702
when it's downloaded,

33:56.735 --> 33:58.270
so Rose and Elena know
we have it, which means

33:58.304 --> 34:00.739
we need a public plan
and a real plan.

34:00.772 --> 34:02.741
And now I can tell you
 Luisa's okay.

34:02.774 --> 34:03.542
Now!

34:03.575 --> 34:05.377
Turn around slowly

34:05.411 --> 34:07.246
and put your hands up.

34:10.849 --> 34:12.251
You set me up?

34:12.284 --> 34:14.420
(crying):
I'm sorry, I had to!

34:14.453 --> 34:17.156
I'm sorry I couldn't
 say anything before.

34:17.188 --> 34:20.659
I wasn't sure
 who I could trust.

34:20.692 --> 34:22.328
SUSANNA:
Stand down!
Put your hands up!

34:22.360 --> 34:24.362
What is she doing?
What is she doing?

34:24.396 --> 34:26.232
Wait, what's happening?

34:26.264 --> 34:28.467
Send your guys in.
We need to wait
until she's out of ICU.

34:28.500 --> 34:30.302
Don't worry,
there's only one way out.

34:30.335 --> 34:31.770
Susanna Barnett.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.505
And now I urge you
 to pay attention.

34:33.539 --> 34:35.507
One of these women
 is about to die.

34:35.541 --> 34:38.444
So the details
 could be important.

34:38.476 --> 34:39.878
Yes.

34:39.911 --> 34:42.313
Susanna Barnett.

34:43.581 --> 34:45.684
I thought it would be you.

34:45.717 --> 34:48.320
Put your hands up.

34:48.353 --> 34:50.688
Your mom lives in Nashville with
your little brother Tyler Dylan.

34:50.722 --> 34:52.724
What was that?

34:52.757 --> 34:55.226
A blue comforter
on his bed?

34:55.261 --> 34:57.363
A Titans banner in the corner?

34:57.396 --> 34:59.498
No...

34:59.531 --> 35:01.667
Stay away from him.

35:01.700 --> 35:03.235
ROSE:
I'd love to.

35:03.269 --> 35:05.471
Escort me out.

35:05.504 --> 35:07.373
I'll take your gun.

35:08.507 --> 35:10.276
Or I will have my associates

35:10.309 --> 35:12.344
execute him,
make no doubt about it.

35:27.359 --> 35:29.495
Follow and I will kill her.

35:29.528 --> 35:31.830
No! No! No!
Damn it, no!

35:36.768 --> 35:39.471
(grunting)

35:44.310 --> 35:46.478
Where is she?
Where is she?

35:46.512 --> 35:48.447
In there!
Go!

35:51.417 --> 35:52.384
Stairs!

35:53.619 --> 35:55.687
Oh, my God.

35:55.721 --> 35:58.624
No!

36:06.398 --> 36:07.766
MICHAEL: She was strangled
by blue silk ties.

36:07.799 --> 36:09.268
That's got to be Mutter.
She beat us here.

36:09.301 --> 36:11.570
Wait for forensics.
We need to do this right.

36:11.603 --> 36:13.572
I need DNA, prints.
Let's get some...

36:13.605 --> 36:16.742
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 And now it's time
 to remind you again

36:16.775 --> 36:20.279
that he had everything
 riding on this.

36:20.312 --> 36:21.480
Huh.

36:21.513 --> 36:22.781
Didn't see that coming.

36:26.618 --> 36:27.686
Or that.

36:47.806 --> 36:49.908
I'm sorry, what?
 I'm sorry, what?

36:51.410 --> 36:52.978
With who?

36:57.015 --> 36:58.517
Oh.

36:58.550 --> 37:00.619
Why didn't you tell me?

37:00.652 --> 37:01.887
Ay...

37:08.627 --> 37:09.995
Well, they shouldn't have.

37:32.418 --> 37:34.653
Yeah, I agree.

37:34.686 --> 37:37.456
No more crying.

37:37.489 --> 37:38.490
(crying)

38:09.488 --> 38:10.556
Hi there.

38:10.589 --> 38:13.492
Powerful scene, no?

38:13.525 --> 38:15.494
Yeah.

38:15.527 --> 38:16.762
It really was.

38:16.795 --> 38:17.896
Poof!

38:20.432 --> 38:23.902
XIOMARA:
 Sometimes there's
 no clear answer.

38:23.935 --> 38:26.405
And sometimes there is.

38:26.438 --> 38:29.341
And I know I don't
want to do this.

38:29.375 --> 38:32.010
Is it the needles?

38:32.043 --> 38:33.612
No.

38:33.645 --> 38:37.115
It's that I love
being a grandmother.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.018
Because I love
being able to choose

38:40.051 --> 38:42.087
whether or not I want
to change a dirty diaper.

38:42.120 --> 38:44.423
And I want that choice.

38:44.456 --> 38:46.124
My needs are important,

38:46.157 --> 38:47.393
like Tiago said.

38:47.426 --> 38:48.894
And I know

38:48.927 --> 38:52.398
I don't want to have
any more kids.

38:52.431 --> 38:56.334
So, uh, I shouldn't
leave the door open.

38:58.504 --> 39:00.472
(crying):
And I know you want them.

39:00.506 --> 39:02.774
So you should have them.

39:30.702 --> 39:33.672
ROGELIO:
My greatest love

39:33.705 --> 39:35.741
was my first love,

39:35.774 --> 39:37.843
Xiomara.

39:37.876 --> 39:40.045
I think about her every day.

39:40.078 --> 39:42.514
(phone buzzing)

39:45.484 --> 39:46.718
Hi, Jane.

39:46.752 --> 39:48.520
Hey, Mom told me what happened.

39:48.554 --> 39:50.556
You okay?

39:50.589 --> 39:52.524
Yes, yes.

39:52.558 --> 39:54.560
Of course.

39:54.593 --> 39:56.562
LUCIANA:
You never told me about her.

39:56.595 --> 39:57.896
I told my pen pal Lola.

39:57.929 --> 40:00.566
It's easier to write
than to talk about.

40:00.599 --> 40:02.568
Plus, Lola is in prison,
so it's not like

40:02.601 --> 40:04.770
she's going to do
anything with my secrets.

40:04.803 --> 40:07.105
She won't be out
for another ten years.

40:07.138 --> 40:10.442
And we'll be on the Bridge
to Total Freedom by then.

40:17.616 --> 40:19.985
(phone chimes)

40:21.720 --> 40:23.855
* This heart
has its bleeding... *

40:23.889 --> 40:26.592
LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:
 She was a romantic,
 you'll recall.

40:26.625 --> 40:29.227
* This heart has
its workings... *

40:29.260 --> 40:32.498
But some moments
 can't be romanticized.

40:32.531 --> 40:34.966
* This heart is still mine

40:35.000 --> 40:38.604
* Which means
it's still yours... *

40:38.637 --> 40:40.706
What are you doing here?

40:40.739 --> 40:41.940
It's over.

40:41.973 --> 40:43.609
Rose is dead.

40:43.642 --> 40:44.976
What?

40:45.010 --> 40:47.145
She can't ever
hurt you or Mateo.

40:47.178 --> 40:48.714
I don't understand.

40:48.747 --> 40:50.115
I-I couldn't jeopardize
your safety again.

40:50.148 --> 40:51.517
I had to push you away.

40:51.550 --> 40:52.618
But-but it's over now.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.252
She's gone and you are safe.

40:54.285 --> 40:56.922
And, Jane, I love you.

40:56.955 --> 40:59.491
I've always loved you.

40:59.525 --> 41:02.160
Oh.

41:02.193 --> 41:04.930
Tell me it's not too late.

41:04.963 --> 41:08.634
Like I said, some moments
 can't be romanticized.

41:08.667 --> 41:10.035
Don't think.
Just tell me.

41:10.068 --> 41:11.903
Do you still love me?

41:11.937 --> 41:14.673
Because they're
 just that perfect.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.542
Yes.
