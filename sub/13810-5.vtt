21:56.023 --> 21:58.108
I WAS ABOUT TO CALL IN
A SEARCH TEAM!

21:58.191 --> 21:59.401
WHAT HAPPENED?!

21:59.484 --> 22:01.737
I CAUGHT THIS BIG FISH

22:01.820 --> 22:04.239
BUT I CAUSED EVERYONE TO LOSE
THEIR CATCH. AND THESE GUYS...

22:04.322 --> 22:06.908
{\an1}YOU DIDN'T LISTEN
TO ME, OTTO.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.578
YOU GUYS COULD HAVE GOTTEN
IN REAL TROUBLE!

22:09.661 --> 22:11.329
I'M SORRY, DAD.

22:12.622 --> 22:14.082
AAH... THE MOST
IMPORTANT THING IS

22:14.166 --> 22:16.752
IS THAT YOU'RE ALL RIGHT.

22:16.835 --> 22:19.337
HMM... NO FISH.

22:19.421 --> 22:21.590
{\an1}WHAT ARE WE GOING TO HAVE
FOR DINNER?!

22:21.673 --> 22:22.799
{\an1}Tito:

22:22.883 --> 22:25.719
I'VE BEEN FISHING WITH
RAYMUNDO HERE FOR YEARS

22:25.802 --> 22:27.637
