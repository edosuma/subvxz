WEBVTT

00:01.535 --> 00:03.003
AND AT THE END
OF THE DREAM,

00:03.070 --> 00:05.639
I HID IN THE CORN
MAZE WITH BILL NYE
THE SCIENCE GUY

00:05.706 --> 00:07.641
- UNTIL THE HURRICANE PASSED.
- ( GASPS )

00:07.708 --> 00:11.044
I HAD THE SAME DREAM
EXCEPT INSTEAD OF A CORN
MAZE, IT WAS THE OSCARS;

00:11.111 --> 00:14.047
AND INSTEAD OF
THE SCIENCE GUY,
IT WAS DRAKE.

00:14.114 --> 00:16.683
SO TOTALLY
DIFFERENT DREAM.

00:16.750 --> 00:19.486
DIFFERENT. BETTER.

00:25.125 --> 00:27.427
SO YOU WANNA MEET
FOR LUNCH LATER? 

00:27.494 --> 00:30.264
I HEARD THAT AWESOME
TACO TRUCK'S GONNA BE
ON CAMPUS.

00:30.330 --> 00:32.599
AS MUCH AS I LOVE
ROLLING THE DICE
ON STREET MEAT,

00:32.666 --> 00:34.067
I HAVE AN IMPROV CLASS.

00:34.134 --> 00:36.303
( SPITS )
WHEN DID YOU START
IMPROV CLASS?

00:36.370 --> 00:39.239
( SPITS ) I TOLD YOU
ABOUT THAT, DIDN'T I?

00:39.306 --> 00:41.642
I DID THE MOST AMAZING
ICE CUBE IN THE DESERT.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.210
"ARE WE THERE YET?

00:43.277 --> 00:46.480
IT'S HOT OUT HERE.
YEAH YEAH!"

00:46.547 --> 00:48.315
DIDN'T THEY MEAN
A FROZEN ICE CUBE?

00:48.382 --> 00:51.118
MAYBE, BUT A FROZEN
ICE CUBE CAN'T SAY
"YEAH YEAH!"

00:53.086 --> 00:54.321
HOW ABOUT COFFEE
THIS AFTERNOON?

00:54.388 --> 00:56.323
CAN'T. OUR PROJECT'S
DUE IN TWO DAYS,

00:56.390 --> 00:59.426
AND I PROMISED SPEWY LEWIS
THAT WE'D WORK ALL AFTERNOON.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.695
- WHO?
- SPEWY LEWIS,
GRAD STUDENT,

01:01.762 --> 01:03.564
CRUSH ON ME,
SPITS WHEN HE TALKS.

01:03.630 --> 01:07.367
I COULD HAVE SWORN
I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIM.
HOW ABOUT HAPPY HOUR?

01:07.434 --> 01:08.068
- CAN'T. DINNER?
- CAN'T.

01:08.135 --> 01:10.037
WHEN DID IT GET SO HARD
FOR US TO MAKE PLANS?

01:10.103 --> 01:13.240
HOW ABOUT A LATE MOVIE?

01:13.307 --> 01:15.309
THE ONE WITH THE GIRL
THAT WE HATE AND THE GUY
THAT WE LIKE?

01:15.375 --> 01:16.043
OUR FAVORITE THEATER?

01:16.109 --> 01:19.346
MAYBE THAT WASN'T SO HARD,
FOR US TO MAKE PLANS.

01:19.413 --> 01:21.014
BAGEL'S READY.

01:22.816 --> 01:24.751
I DON'T THINK THIS
ACTUALLY SAVES US ANY
TIME IN THE MORNING.

01:24.818 --> 01:27.321
I JUST LIKE WATCHING
YOU COOK WITH IT.

01:27.387 --> 01:29.056
MAYBE ONE DAY I'LL SHOW YOU
HOW TO USE IT ON YOUR HAIR.

01:29.122 --> 01:32.125
<i>( THEME MUSIC PLAYING )</i>

01:43.837 --> 01:46.039
FREDERICK, YOU HAVE
GOT TO STOP CALLING ME.

01:46.106 --> 01:48.609
YOU ARE A SWEET MAN,

01:48.675 --> 01:51.211
BUT I DON'T WANNA
THE TRIAL'S OVER.IL

01:52.880 --> 01:54.248
HANDLE YOUR BUSINESS,
AUNT HONEY.

01:54.314 --> 01:56.216
FREDDIE WAS FINE,

01:56.283 --> 01:58.252
BUT MAMA LIKES HER MAN'S
REPUTATION SOLID

01:58.318 --> 02:00.053
AND HIS ASSETS LIQUID.

02:00.120 --> 02:03.056
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOUR HALL CLOSET,E

02:03.123 --> 02:05.959
BUT DID YOU KNOW IT
WITH OLD BOXES?

02:06.026 --> 02:07.060
THAT'S WHY I SAID YOU
COULD USE THE CLOSET--

02:07.127 --> 02:11.598
SO YOU'D MOVE ALL
THE OLD BOXES.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.600
AUNT HONEY, YOU DON'T
INTO HELPING YOU.

02:13.667 --> 02:15.035
THAT'S WHAT
WE HAVE JO FOR.

02:15.102 --> 02:19.806
BUT I AM GONNA KEEP
FIERCENESS.OF VINTAGE

02:19.873 --> 02:21.608
IT'S YOURS.
THAT OLD THING

02:21.675 --> 02:23.677
SINCE I GOT RID
OF THE POLE.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.180
PUT YOUR EYES BACK
IN YOUR HEAD.

02:26.246 --> 02:29.049
I DATED A POLISH COUNT.

02:29.116 --> 02:32.019
HMM. OF COURSE YOU DID.

02:32.085 --> 02:34.054
- ( LAUGHS )
CLASS OF--"IGH SCHOOL,

02:34.121 --> 02:37.191
OH! NONE-YA.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.660
HEY, IS THAT YOU?

02:39.726 --> 02:43.230
IT WAS MY FIRST WEEK
IN NEW YORK.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.299
I DIDN'T KNOW THEY MADE
CAMERAS BACK THEN.

02:47.034 --> 02:50.771
- I'M JUST KIDDING.
- THAT WAS A GOOD DAY.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.974
REGGIE JACKSON HAD JUST
ASKED FOR MY NUMBER.

02:54.041 --> 02:57.711
I'M GOING TO NOD LIKE
I KNOW WHO THAT IS.

02:58.111 --> 03:00.881
WHO'S THE OTHER GIRL
IN THE PICTURE?

03:00.948 --> 03:03.217
THAT'S PATRICE.
SHE WAS MY BEST FRIEND.

03:03.283 --> 03:05.052
SORT OF LIKE YOU AND JO.

03:05.118 --> 03:09.423
HONEY AND TRICEY WERE GONNA
TAKE OVER THE WORLD.

03:09.489 --> 03:11.658
WHERE'S PATRICE NOW?

03:11.725 --> 03:13.026
I DON'T KNOW.

03:13.093 --> 03:16.363
OH, LOOK!
MY KEY TO THE CITY.

03:16.430 --> 03:20.300
I JUST WISH I COULD
REMEMBER WHICH CITY.

03:20.367 --> 03:22.636
YOU GUYS WERE BEST FRIENDS.
WHAT HAPPENED?

03:22.703 --> 03:25.606
WE GOT BUSY.
TIME FOR EACH OTHER.E

03:25.672 --> 03:27.107
WE JUST DRIFTED APART.

03:27.174 --> 03:29.209
DON'T YOU WISH YOU
COULD SEE HER AGAIN?

03:29.276 --> 03:31.345
THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING.

03:31.411 --> 03:35.215
OH LOOK,
MY LITTLE BLACK BOOK.

03:35.282 --> 03:38.252
OH, AND MY LITTLE
WHITE BOOK!

03:38.318 --> 03:41.121
MY LITTLE LATINO BOOK!
( SCREAMS )

03:47.995 --> 03:51.698
ALL THESE YEARS AND AUNT HONEY
HAS NEVER SAID ONE WORD
ABOUT THIS PERSON.

03:51.765 --> 03:55.435
I KNOW. THREE HOME
RUNS ON THREE PITCHES
IN ONE WORLD SERIES GAME.

03:55.502 --> 03:57.104
BANANAS.

03:57.171 --> 03:59.306
NOT REGGIE JACKSON.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.975
I'M TALKING ABOUT PATRICE.
SHE AND AUNT HONEY DID
EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

04:02.042 --> 04:05.045
AND THEN ONE DAY,
NOTHING. SO SAD.

04:05.112 --> 04:08.048
- YOU'RE SAD?
- I'M NOT SAD.
AUNT HONEY'S SAD.

04:08.115 --> 04:11.485
-<i>AREN'T YOU LISTENING?</i>
- I'M CARRYING TWO THINGS
OF POPCORN

04:11.552 --> 04:14.021
AND A SODA AND I'M TRYING
TO FIND YOU IN THE DARK. 

04:14.087 --> 04:16.156
IF ANYONE'S SAD,
IT'S ME.

04:16.223 --> 04:18.692
WE SHOULD TRY
AND GET THEM BACK TOGETHER.

04:18.759 --> 04:20.060
AUNT HONEY
AND REGGIE JACKSON?

04:20.127 --> 04:22.029
AUNT HONEY AND PATRICE.

04:22.095 --> 04:24.031
I THINK I'M GONNA
TRACK HER DOWN.

04:24.097 --> 04:27.434
BUT AUNT HONEY LIVES
RIGHT UPSTAIRS.

04:27.501 --> 04:29.169
PATRICE!

04:29.236 --> 04:31.939
GOODNESS, JO,
YOU BUILT A COMPUTER
WHEN YOU WERE EIGHT,

04:32.005 --> 04:35.776
BUT YOU CAN'T CARRY, WALK
AND THINK AT THE SAME TIME.

04:35.843 --> 04:38.178
OH!

04:38.245 --> 04:40.247
WELL, THAT MAKES
THINGS EASIER,

04:40.314 --> 04:43.016
BUT I STILL
DON'T SEE YOU.

04:43.083 --> 04:46.353
OKAY, LISTEN, I'M THE GIRL
STANDING UP,

04:46.420 --> 04:48.055
WAVING THE BRIGHT
RED BOA.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.024
YOU WOULD THINK
I'D SEE THAT.

04:51.091 --> 04:54.027
NO, THIS IS SAVED
FOR MY BEST FRIEND,

04:54.094 --> 04:56.029
WHICH YOU CAN BE
ANYTIME YOU LIKE.

04:56.096 --> 04:59.066
HEY, JO, WHAT--

04:59.132 --> 05:01.134
WHAT THEATER
ARE YOU IN?

05:01.201 --> 05:02.970
<i>OUR FAVORITE,</i>
<i>THE LAFAYETTE.</i>

05:03.036 --> 05:06.974
NO NO, SEE,
OUR FAVORITE IS THE MADISON,

05:07.040 --> 05:09.042
WHERE I AM.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.111
SO I SHOULD PROBABLY STOP
HUGGING THIS PERFECT STRANGER?

05:15.916 --> 05:18.519
YOU KNOW WHY THE MADISON
IS OUR FAVORITE THEATER?

05:18.585 --> 05:21.488
IT HAS REAL BUTTER
AND SEATS THAT GO BACK.

05:21.555 --> 05:24.324
NO, THE LAFAYETTE IS
OUR FAVORITE BECAUSE
IT HAS FAKE BUTTER

05:24.391 --> 05:26.693
AND ARMRESTS
THAT GO UP BECAUSE
SOMETIMES I GET SCARED

05:26.760 --> 05:29.463
AND NEED TO LIE DOWN.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.865
OH MY GOD,
THIS IS HOW IT STARTS.

05:31.932 --> 05:34.034
- HOW WHAT STARTS?
- THE DRIFTING APART
LIKE AUNT HONEY AND PATRICE.

05:34.101 --> 05:38.038
DON'T BE RIDICULOUS.
OKAY, THAT'S TOOTHPASTE.

05:38.105 --> 05:41.341
OH! SEE?
IT'S HAPPENING.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.443
THE ONLY THING
THAT'S HAPPENING IS
THAT NOW MY CHEEKS

05:43.510 --> 05:45.045
- ARE TARTAR FREE.
- ( SPITS )

05:45.112 --> 05:49.750
JO, THINK ABOUT IT.
EVER SINCE WE WERE FIVE,
WE DID EVERYTHING TOGETHER.

05:49.816 --> 05:52.419
NOW WE'VE GOT
DIFFERENT SCHEDULES

05:52.486 --> 05:56.423
- AND NEW FRIENDS.
WE'RE JUST OUT OF SYNC.
- ( SPITS )

05:56.490 --> 05:58.425
OOPSY.

05:58.492 --> 06:01.962
NOW SPIT ON MY ARM,
BUDDY.

06:02.029 --> 06:04.798
OUT OF SYNC.

06:04.865 --> 06:06.066
GEORGIA, YOU'RE MAKING
WAY TOO BIG A DEAL
OUT OF THE FACT

06:06.133 --> 06:08.068
- THAT YOU GOT
THE THEATER WRONG.
- NO, I'M NOT.

06:08.135 --> 06:11.538
- AND YOU GOT IT WRONG.
- MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO BE
HERE WHEN YOU REALIZE

06:11.605 --> 06:14.474
HOW WRONG YOU ARE,
I GOTTA MEET SETH
AND LEO FOR COFFEE.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.476
- WHO?
- FROM SCHOOL.

06:16.543 --> 06:18.679
- I DIDN'T TELL YOU
ABOUT THEM?
- NO!

06:18.745 --> 06:20.047
THERE'S A RUMOR
THAT LAST WINTER
WHEN THE HEAT WENT OUT,

06:20.113 --> 06:24.251
SETH AND LEO HAD
TO SHARE A BED FOR
A WEEK TO STAY WARM.

06:24.318 --> 06:27.721
PEOPLE CALLED THEM
THE SNUGGLE BUNNIES.

06:27.788 --> 06:30.557
THAT'S WHAT I'M TALKING
ABOUT, JOE, THERE'S SPITTING
AND SNUGGLING GOING ON.

06:30.624 --> 06:33.060
- I SHOULD KNOW THESE THINGS.
- GEORGIA, YOUR HAIR!

06:33.126 --> 06:34.061
DON'T CHANGE
THE SUBJECT, JO.

06:34.127 --> 06:38.098
YOU HAVE A WHOLE
ENTIRE WORLD THAT
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT.

06:38.165 --> 06:41.268
WHAT IS IT--
( SCREAMS ) MY HAIR!

06:41.335 --> 06:42.736
OH!

06:42.803 --> 06:46.473
THAT IS GONNA
SMELL ALL DAY.

06:46.540 --> 06:49.610
LOOK AT US, JO.
WE'RE FALLING APART.

06:49.676 --> 06:51.512
WE'RE NOT FALLING APART.

06:51.578 --> 06:54.114
OF COURSE, YOU'RE SMOLDERING
AND I'M LATE FOR SCHOOL,
BUT MOSTLY WE'RE FINE.

06:56.617 --> 07:00.153
JO! JO, YOU FORGOT
TO PUT ON YOUR PANTS.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.623
<i>YOU HAVE</i>
<i>A GOOD DAY TOO.</i>

07:03.123 --> 07:06.159
WE'RE SO FALLING APART.

07:10.631 --> 07:12.933
NO, LEO,
IT COULD NEVER HAPPEN.

07:13.000 --> 07:14.034
I'M NOT SAYING
IT'S LIKELY, SETH.

07:14.101 --> 07:16.036
I'M JUST SAYING
IT'S PHYSICALLY POSSIBLE.

07:16.103 --> 07:18.605
- I'M NOT GONNA ENGAGE--
- THEN DON'T.

07:18.672 --> 07:20.440
GUYS, GUYS, GUYS, GUYS.

07:20.507 --> 07:22.943
THIS IS NOT THE TIME
TO DEBATE WHAT
WOULD HAPPEN

07:23.010 --> 07:26.213
IF A VULCAN HAD SEX
WITH AN EWOK.

07:26.280 --> 07:29.049
LET'S JUST AGREE THAT
THE BABY WOULD BE
VERY SMART

07:29.116 --> 07:31.418
AND VERY ADORABLE.

07:31.485 --> 07:34.421
OR IT COULD HAVE
POINTY EARS

07:34.488 --> 07:36.023
AND SING IN A TREE.

07:36.089 --> 07:39.626
NO, IT COULDN'T, LEWIS,
BECAUSE IT COULD
NEVER HAPPEN.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.029
YOU PUT THAT AWAY.

07:42.095 --> 07:46.033
GUYS, CAN WE PLEASE
JUST FOCUS ON THIS PROJECT

07:46.099 --> 07:49.136
WITHOUT ANY MORE
DISTRACTIONS, PLEASE?

07:49.203 --> 07:51.538
SURPRISE!

07:51.605 --> 07:53.941
WHAT'S POPPIN',
PHYSICS PEOPLE?

07:54.007 --> 07:56.343
WHAT ARE ALL THESE DIGITS?
WHAT IS THAT?

08:06.820 --> 08:08.755
GEORGIA, WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

08:08.822 --> 08:10.457
WHAT?
I WANNA SEE YOU.

08:10.524 --> 08:14.094
I WANNA SOAK UP YOUR WORLD,
MEET YOUR NEW FRIENDS,
CHILLAX.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.629
WHY?

08:15.696 --> 08:17.231
BECAUSE YOU'RE
ALWAYS SAYING,

08:17.297 --> 08:19.233
"VISIT, MEET MY FRIENDS,
SOAK UP MY WORLD,

08:19.299 --> 08:21.468
CHILLAX."

08:21.535 --> 08:23.670
- I HAVE NEVER SAID THAT.
- THEN THAT'S JUST RUDE.

08:23.737 --> 08:26.440
ARE YOU FREAKING OUT
BECAUSE OF THE MOVIE
THEATER THING?

08:26.507 --> 08:29.176
WHAT? NO.
CAN'T A FRIEND
VISIT A FRIEND

08:29.243 --> 08:31.678
WITHOUT ALL
THESE SUSPICIONS
AND ALLEGATIONS?

08:32.946 --> 08:34.948
HEY, SO THIS IS WHERE

08:35.015 --> 08:36.917
ALL THE MAGIC HAPPENS,
HUH?

08:36.984 --> 08:40.020
MAGIC IS THE ANTITHESIS
OF SCIENCE.

08:40.087 --> 08:42.322
IN SCIENCE,
WE DEAL WITH FACTS.

08:42.389 --> 08:45.225
FACT: WE ARE
EXTREMELY BUSY.

08:45.292 --> 08:48.929
FACT: YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO CONTRIBUTE.

08:48.996 --> 08:50.964
THIS THE GUY
WHO LIKES YOU?

08:51.031 --> 08:52.866
FACT: YOU CAN DO BETTER.

08:52.933 --> 08:55.402
THAT'S ENOUGH.

08:55.469 --> 08:58.005
- YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME.
- I KNOW WHY THEY CALL
YOU SPEWY LEWIS.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.773
- GEORGIA!
- WHAT?!

08:59.840 --> 09:02.042
HE SHOULD COME
WITH A TOWEL.

09:02.109 --> 09:03.777
FOR YOUR INFORMATION,

09:03.844 --> 09:05.846
AN OVERACTIVE
SALIVARY GLAND

09:05.913 --> 09:08.448
IS A SIGN OF VIRILITY.

09:08.515 --> 09:11.151
LEWIS, WAIT. OH!

09:11.218 --> 09:13.554
COME ON,
WE'LL BE FINE.

09:13.620 --> 09:17.624
SETH THINKS
SOMEONE ELSE IS FINE.

09:19.726 --> 09:21.328
SHUT UP, LEO.

09:21.395 --> 09:24.498
SETH AND LEO?
THE SNUGGLE BUNNIES?

09:24.565 --> 09:27.568
- NO NO NO NO NO.
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

09:27.634 --> 09:31.004
SO HOW COLD DOES IT
HAVE TO GET FOR YOU GUYS
TO SNUGGLE TOGETHER?

09:31.071 --> 09:33.006
- YOU'RE SO CUTE.
- WHO DID YOU TELL?

09:33.073 --> 09:35.275
WHAT ARE YOU ASHAMED OF?
WE WERE WEARING UNDERPANTS.

09:35.342 --> 09:38.145
SHUT UP!

09:38.212 --> 09:41.114
THANKS A LOT, JO.
NOW I'LL HAVE TO GO
EARN HIS TRUST BACK.

09:41.181 --> 09:43.684
SETH!

09:43.750 --> 09:45.986
HOW COULD YOU DO THAT?

09:46.053 --> 09:48.989
- YOU SAID PEOPLE CALLED
THEM THE SNUGGLE BUNNIES.
- NOT TO THEIR FACES.

09:49.056 --> 09:51.692
WELL, THEN THAT'S ON YOU,
SWEETHEART. YOU SHOULD
HAVE BEEN MORE CLEAR.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.061
I CAN'T BELIEVE
WE LOST HALF THE TEAM.

09:54.127 --> 09:56.597
SO WHAT?
YOU SAID YOU PRETTY MUCH
DO ALL THE WORK ANYWAY.

09:58.932 --> 10:00.167
WOULD YOU PLEASE
STOP TALKING?

10:00.234 --> 10:02.870
OKAY.
OKAY, FINE.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.838
LISTEN, I AM A FLY
ON THE WALL.

10:04.905 --> 10:07.107
ON A CHAIR--
A FLY ON A CHAIR

10:07.174 --> 10:09.676
SOAKING UP YOUR WORLD.

10:09.743 --> 10:13.313
OKAY, I APOLOGIZE
FOR THAT,

10:13.380 --> 10:15.482

WHAT AM I GONNA DO
WITH YOU TWO?

19:26.300 --> 19:27.601
AND WHAT ARE YOU
LOOKING SO SAD ABOUT?

19:27.668 --> 19:30.704
I'M THE ONE WHO HAD
TO DEAL WITH THAT JEZEBEL.

19:32.206 --> 19:36.043
WELL, YOU AND PATRICE
WERE SO CLOSE AND
NOW YOU'RE NOT,

TO HAPPEN BETWEEN US.

19:38.178 --> 19:41.615
WHAT? YOU TWO ARE NOTHING
LIKE ME AND PATRICE.

AND LESS IN COMMON.

WERE EXACTLY ALIKE,

BACKSTABBING PART.

19:55.162 --> 19:57.731
YOU FORGOT CHEATING.

19:57.798 --> 20:01.902
WHY ARE YOU ALL UP
IN MY BUSINESS?

20:01.969 --> 20:05.305
YOU TWO SHOULD BE GLAD
THAT YOU'RE SO DIFFERENT.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.541
- WE SHOULD?
- YES.

20:07.608 --> 20:10.477
THAT'S WHAT
KEEPS YOU SO CLOSE.

20:10.544 --> 20:12.946

DOOMED TO DRIFT APART.

HAD TO WITNESS

A LOT OF HISTORY THERE.

20:38.238 --> 20:40.407
NO, I'M EMBARRASSED THAT
I LET HER GET THAT CLOSE

20:40.474 --> 20:42.509
BEFORE I COULD GRAB MY GUN.

20:42.576 --> 20:46.513
I MEAN, WHAT WAS THE POINT
OF ALL THAT TRAINING?

20:54.888 --> 20:57.057
THESE 20 MINUTES
IN THE MORNING MAY BE
ALL WE HAVE SOMETIMES,

20:57.124 --> 21:00.093
- BUT IT'S MY FAVORITE
PART OF THE DAY.
- MINE TOO.
