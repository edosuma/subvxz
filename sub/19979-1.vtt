01:00.694 --> 01:02.428
there he is.

01:02.430 --> 01:05.464
Jesus. You'll tell him
you were the reason
we're late, right?

01:05.465 --> 01:07.232
Come on. I don't--

01:07.234 --> 01:08.834
I don't want him
to think I don't care
about time and stuff.

01:08.836 --> 01:10.436
There's my girl.

01:10.438 --> 01:12.371
There's my dad.

01:13.740 --> 01:16.442
Dad, this is
my boyfriend Martin.

01:16.444 --> 01:18.210
Pleasure to meet you,
Mr. Martin.

01:18.212 --> 01:19.578
Uh, Mr. gallo.
I'm Martin.

01:19.580 --> 01:21.146
You're Mr. gallo.

01:21.148 --> 01:22.214
I know that.

01:22.216 --> 01:23.849
Nice to meet you, Martin.

01:29.756 --> 01:31.123
Fuck.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.326
It's really good
to see you.

01:34.328 --> 01:35.727
You look great.

01:35.729 --> 01:37.729
You look tired.
Where you coming from
this time?

01:37.731 --> 01:39.531
Singapore.
Ah.

01:39.533 --> 01:40.766
Ever been?

01:40.768 --> 01:42.468
No, I haven't been.

01:42.470 --> 01:46.205
Uh, i-- I hear
it's very, um, clean,
which I like.

01:46.207 --> 01:49.741
I also hear that they
cane you if you spit
in the street.

01:49.743 --> 01:52.811
Uh, not that I like that.
Yeah, I don't
like that part.

01:52.813 --> 01:56.148
Good evening.
Can I bring you
something to drink?

01:56.150 --> 01:58.684
Shall we start
with a nice bottle
of red?

01:58.686 --> 02:01.620
Uh, Martin has
a sulfite allergy.

02:01.622 --> 02:04.256
A sulfite allergy?

02:04.258 --> 02:06.558
Um, it's not that bad,
actually.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.794
I just get
a little, uh, hivey.

02:09.797 --> 02:12.831
But I'm fine with water

02:12.833 --> 02:14.133
or death.

02:14.135 --> 02:16.235
Okay. Uh, we'll have

02:16.237 --> 02:17.870
a bottle of
the chateauneuf-du-pape.

02:17.872 --> 02:19.404
Excellent choice.

02:19.406 --> 02:21.740
And, Martin,
are you sure? Nothing?

02:21.742 --> 02:24.243
Maybe a beer?
Or are you allergic
to hops?

02:24.245 --> 02:25.477
Heh.

02:32.185 --> 02:33.919
You sure you don't want
something else, Martin?

02:33.921 --> 02:36.588
Mm. Oh, no.
This is delicious.

02:36.590 --> 02:38.757
These beets are
really well steamed.

02:40.761 --> 02:42.928
I'm sorry.
I gotta take this.

02:46.799 --> 02:48.300
He hates me.

02:48.302 --> 02:49.568
He doesn't hate you.

02:49.570 --> 02:50.936
He hates me.

02:50.938 --> 02:53.305
He hates me so much,
I'm starting to hate myself.

02:53.307 --> 02:56.642
All that matters
is what I think,
and I'm a fan.

02:56.644 --> 02:57.876
Yeah?

02:57.878 --> 02:58.877
Big fan.

02:58.879 --> 03:00.746
Huge fan.

03:03.750 --> 03:05.184
All right.

03:05.186 --> 03:07.419
Martin:
Okay, I got this.

03:09.823 --> 03:11.490
I'll bounce back.

03:11.492 --> 03:12.791
Round two.

03:13.860 --> 03:15.194
Sorry about that.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.628
It's, uh,
not a problem.

03:16.630 --> 03:18.697
Looks like a, uh,
pretty major deal

03:18.699 --> 03:21.500
just went down over there
by the bar, huh?

03:23.970 --> 03:26.605
So, Martin,
what is it
that you do?

03:26.607 --> 03:29.208
Uh, dad, I told you
Martin is a musician.

03:29.210 --> 03:30.742
Right. Right.
What is it,

03:30.744 --> 03:31.944
the, uh, ukulele?

03:31.946 --> 03:33.912
Uh, it's the, uh, banjo.

03:33.914 --> 03:36.748
Banjo. Right,
like Kermit the frog.

03:36.750 --> 03:38.450
Heh.
I guess I assumed

03:38.452 --> 03:39.851
the banjo was a hobby.

03:39.853 --> 03:41.420
Well,
i have a band,

03:41.422 --> 03:42.721
hysterical kindness.

03:42.723 --> 03:45.357
It's a bluegrass collective,

03:45.359 --> 03:48.227
more flatt and scruggs
or punch brothers

03:48.229 --> 03:51.763
than some, you know,
poppy mumford & sons
kind of wannabe thing.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.498
What's wrong
with mumford & sons?

03:53.500 --> 03:55.500
They're a very
successful act, no?

03:55.502 --> 03:58.503
He likes
mumford & sons.

04:00.406 --> 04:02.441
So where you from?

04:02.443 --> 04:04.376
Well, I was born
in Chicago,

04:04.378 --> 04:06.578
uh, but I grew up
in guelph.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.280
Guelph?

04:08.282 --> 04:10.582
Uh, guelph, Ontario.

04:10.584 --> 04:13.252
Guelph?
It's, uh...

04:14.454 --> 04:15.487
Canada.

04:15.489 --> 04:17.422
Guelph?

04:17.423 --> 04:18.991
Okay.

04:18.993 --> 04:20.659
Your folks,
what do they do?

04:20.661 --> 04:22.361
Jesus, dad, what is
with the third degree?

04:22.363 --> 04:23.996
Third degree?
I'm just getting
to know the guy.

04:23.998 --> 04:25.430
You don't mind,
do you, Martin?

04:25.432 --> 04:26.632
No. No, no. It's great.

04:26.634 --> 04:28.000
It's great getting
to know someone

04:28.002 --> 04:29.768
this, you know,
vigorously.

04:32.438 --> 04:33.739
So your parents?

04:33.741 --> 04:35.474
Oh. Right. Um...

04:35.476 --> 04:39.278
My mother is
an acupuncturist
in Toronto,

04:39.280 --> 04:42.347
and my father
is an, um--

04:42.349 --> 04:46.518
he's an environmental
activist in Albuquerque.

04:48.921 --> 04:51.723
He's an
environmental activist
in Albuquerque, dad.

04:51.725 --> 04:52.724
Deal with it.

04:52.726 --> 04:54.993
I didn't
say anything.

04:56.462 --> 04:58.330
I'm sure it's
very satisfying work.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.333
He never met a tree
that he didn't want
to chain himself to.

05:05.038 --> 05:07.739
Sweetie,
you have a little,
um, salad dressing.

05:07.741 --> 05:08.974
Oh.

05:08.976 --> 05:11.476
Oops. Oh.
Mr. gallo,

05:11.478 --> 05:13.745
I am so sorry.

05:14.914 --> 05:17.716
I am so sorry.

05:41.941 --> 05:44.743
Could tonight's dinner
have gone any worse?

05:44.745 --> 05:47.346
Actually,
it could have.

05:47.348 --> 05:50.382
Mm, I guess
he could have castrated me
at the table.

05:50.384 --> 05:52.451
Last time
i introduced dad
to a boyfriend,

05:52.453 --> 05:54.119
I never heard
from the guy
again, so...

05:54.121 --> 05:56.121
Wow. When I disappear next,

05:56.123 --> 05:58.123
ask your dad
where my body's buried,

05:58.125 --> 06:00.992
just as, you know,
like, a courtesy to my mom.

06:00.994 --> 06:03.729
Martin,
i know he's tough.

06:03.731 --> 06:06.031
But you're
not gonna have
to deal with him.

06:07.367 --> 06:08.900
I probably
won't see him

06:08.902 --> 06:11.103
for another year,
so...

06:11.105 --> 06:12.571
Oh.

06:12.573 --> 06:14.940
In that case, I think
we should make a plan

06:14.942 --> 06:16.608
to see him
sooner than that.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.812
You'd be up for that?

06:20.814 --> 06:22.981
Absolutely.

06:22.983 --> 06:25.150
I would
go through that hell

06:25.152 --> 06:27.652
all over again for you.

07:02.488 --> 07:04.055
Coming.

07:04.057 --> 07:05.524
I'm coming.

07:15.668 --> 07:17.803
Mr. gallo?

07:17.805 --> 07:19.037
Ginnie home?

07:19.039 --> 07:21.440
Home? Uh, no. No.

07:21.442 --> 07:25.143
I mean, uh,
she may be home,
but, uh...

07:26.879 --> 07:29.448
Ginnie doesn't
live here anymore.

07:32.018 --> 07:33.552
We broke up.

07:34.821 --> 07:35.821
Okay.

07:38.225 --> 07:39.991
Want to invite me in?

07:39.993 --> 07:41.893
Oh. Yeah.

07:41.895 --> 07:43.128
Yeah. No, of course.

07:43.130 --> 07:44.729
Sorry.

07:44.731 --> 07:47.666
I was just, uh,
getting some work done.

07:50.137 --> 07:53.572
She didn't
tell you when we,
uh, broke up?

07:53.574 --> 07:55.073
We haven't spoken
since Christmas.

07:55.075 --> 07:58.109
Ah. Well, I guess
you could call her,

07:58.111 --> 08:02.080
you know, to get
her, uh, new address
to go there.

08:02.082 --> 08:03.248
She's not picking up

08:03.250 --> 08:05.183
or returning calls
or texts.

08:05.185 --> 08:07.652
I was hoping
maybe she'd be here.

08:10.056 --> 08:11.690
Oh, I just, uh--

08:11.692 --> 08:14.125
I just had a little, uh,
get-together last month, so--

08:14.127 --> 08:15.160
don't worry about it.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.229
Just cleaning, anyway.

08:17.231 --> 08:18.663
Yeah. So, uh,

08:18.665 --> 08:20.866
any idea where
i could find
my daughter?

08:20.868 --> 08:24.069
Did you try
Gary and Roberta?

08:24.071 --> 08:25.070
Gary and Roberta?

08:25.072 --> 08:26.137
Yeah. When she moved out,

08:26.139 --> 08:28.073
she went
to go stay with them.

08:28.075 --> 08:30.575
Do you want any coffee?

08:30.577 --> 08:32.010
Uh, that's-- that's okay.
Don't bother.

08:32.011 --> 08:34.913
I'm just gonna
make some anyway.

08:34.914 --> 08:37.015
So, uh...

08:39.052 --> 08:41.086
So when did
you two break up?

08:41.087 --> 08:43.154
Uh, about three months ago.

08:43.155 --> 08:45.757
Three months and nine days
or something.

08:45.759 --> 08:48.260
I don't-- you know,
I'm not, uh--

08:48.262 --> 08:50.161
I'm sure she's, uh--

08:50.163 --> 08:53.532
you said she, uh--
she knew you were
coming in to town?

08:53.534 --> 08:55.934
I gave her the heads-up
i was coming in
last minute,

08:55.936 --> 08:57.302
but I never
got a response.

09:04.277 --> 09:06.878
Huh.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.180
No, no. This is--
this is jimothy,

09:09.182 --> 09:11.283
uh, is my new roommate.

09:11.285 --> 09:12.284
Gallo: Gotcha.

09:12.286 --> 09:14.719
Jimothy.

09:14.721 --> 09:16.621
Like Timothy
with a "j."

09:16.623 --> 09:19.124
No.

09:19.126 --> 09:22.027
Jimothy,
this is Mr. gallo,

09:22.029 --> 09:23.094
ginnie's dad.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.162
Who?

09:24.164 --> 09:26.298
Ex-girlfriend's father.

09:27.800 --> 09:29.634
Do you have
the bong?

09:30.870 --> 09:33.171
What? I, uh-- I don't
know what you mean?

09:33.173 --> 09:34.940
What do you mean by that?

09:34.942 --> 09:38.243
The bong,
thing I smoke weed
out of all day.

09:38.245 --> 09:40.879
Oh, is that-- is that--
is that what this is?

09:40.881 --> 09:42.247
I was-- yeah,
i was looking earlier.

09:42.249 --> 09:44.015
I just didn't--
i was curious.

09:44.017 --> 09:46.217
You're giving me
a real stressy
vibe, man.

09:46.219 --> 09:47.285
Uh...
You stressed out?

09:47.287 --> 09:48.620
What's going on?
J-jimothy.

09:48.622 --> 09:49.921
Could you just, um--

09:49.923 --> 09:51.856
just take
your weird machine there

09:51.858 --> 09:54.259
and just let
Mr. gallo and I talk?

09:54.261 --> 09:56.928
Am I wrong?
Is he giving you
a stressy vibe?

09:56.930 --> 09:57.929
You're not wrong.

09:57.931 --> 09:59.631
Yeah.

09:59.633 --> 10:01.666
I'm having
people over tonight,

10:01.668 --> 10:03.735
in case
you want to hide
in your room again.

10:03.737 --> 10:04.903
You can come.

10:04.905 --> 10:06.738
I thought-- you know,
i thought we said,

10:06.740 --> 10:09.774
uh-- we agreed,
you know, last time,

10:09.776 --> 10:11.676
you know, with--
with the cops...

10:11.678 --> 10:14.913
Oh, so I'm not allowed
to have people over
in my own home?

10:14.915 --> 10:17.048
No, it's cool.
Whatever.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.384
Oh, did you get
my message?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.152
What message?

10:21.154 --> 10:22.654
The fiddle player
in your band
or something

10:22.656 --> 10:23.922
came by,
wanted you to know

10:23.924 --> 10:25.624
you had a show
this weekend
or something.

10:25.626 --> 10:28.026
Wait. What do you mean?
We have a show?

10:28.028 --> 10:29.260
I think so.

10:29.262 --> 10:31.863
Well, did he say
when or where?

10:31.865 --> 10:33.298
Didn't say when.

10:33.300 --> 10:35.800
Didn't say where.

10:43.242 --> 10:45.310
You know, I'm not--

10:45.312 --> 10:46.711
heh. He's not--

10:46.713 --> 10:48.113
we're not--
we're not friends.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.414
None of my business.
W-we're just friends.

10:49.416 --> 10:50.849
Okay.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.417
When ginnie moved out,
i needed

10:52.419 --> 10:54.152
a new roommate
to help cover the rent.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.754
Of course, yeah.
You don't wanna let go

10:55.756 --> 10:57.288
of a prime piece of
real estate like this.

10:57.290 --> 11:00.258
Yeah. No, these crossbeams,
you don't always--

11:01.861 --> 11:03.395
oh.

11:03.397 --> 11:05.397
Oh, I'll go get
that coffee.

11:05.399 --> 11:08.166
Look, Martin,
i can see you're, uh,

11:08.168 --> 11:10.301
a busy man here.

11:10.303 --> 11:12.937
Tomorrow I have
to get on a flight
to Geneva.

11:12.939 --> 11:15.073
All I want to do
is find my daughter,

11:15.075 --> 11:17.676
so if you
can just point me
to her new place,

11:17.678 --> 11:18.977
I'll get out
of your hair.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.779
Uh, we're all
out of milk.

11:20.781 --> 11:23.815
And sugar.
Uh, but we have syrup.

11:23.817 --> 11:25.717
You want syrup
in your coffee,

11:25.719 --> 11:27.218
or is that--
is that weird?

11:27.220 --> 11:29.688
I don't want syrup.
Thanks.

11:29.690 --> 11:30.689
Okay.

11:30.691 --> 11:32.924
So do you have
an address

11:32.926 --> 11:34.926
for this Gary
and Roberta?

11:34.928 --> 11:38.763
Uh, no, but they're
not too far from here.

11:38.765 --> 11:41.266
Uh, I don't have an address,
but I've been over there.

11:41.268 --> 11:43.001
So it's close?
Yeah.

11:43.003 --> 11:44.869
Yes, it's just
a couple blocks that-a-way.

11:44.871 --> 11:46.304
Okay. You want
to get dressed,

11:46.306 --> 11:47.706
and you can
take me over there?

11:47.708 --> 11:48.907
Now?

11:48.909 --> 11:51.042
Yes, now, Martin.
Do you mind?

11:54.181 --> 11:55.980
Fuck.

11:55.982 --> 11:57.849
Fuck this.

11:57.851 --> 12:00.919
Hey, Martin, do you mind
if I go on this computer
for a minute,

12:00.921 --> 12:02.120
check e-mails?

12:02.122 --> 12:04.189
Um, yeah, sure.
Go ahead.

12:04.191 --> 12:05.423
Fuck. Uh, wait!

12:05.425 --> 12:06.825
H-hold on!
Why don't you just--

12:06.827 --> 12:09.894
Holy shit!

12:09.896 --> 12:11.262
Uh, you know, I just--

12:11.264 --> 12:13.832
I tell jimothy
not to use my computer,

12:13.834 --> 12:15.166
but he does.

12:19.305 --> 12:20.905
Look, Martin,
porn is porn,

12:20.907 --> 12:23.174
you know,
but you gotta hide
that shit.

12:23.176 --> 12:25.343
Put it in a folder
or something.
Yeah.

12:25.345 --> 12:27.345
Can't just leave it
hanging out there.

12:27.347 --> 12:29.314
You know, i--
i can't even believe

12:29.316 --> 12:31.983
that they have sites
like that on the Internet.
Uh, those poor women.

12:31.985 --> 12:34.352
Okay, you want
to put on some pants
so we can hit the road?

12:42.429 --> 12:44.863
Here. You know
where we're going.
You drive.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.531
Ahh.

12:48.001 --> 12:49.801
Wasn't ready for that.

12:49.803 --> 12:52.504
Actually, I don't drive.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.777
What do you mean,
you don't drive?

12:58.779 --> 13:00.245
Ah, I don't
have my license.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.448
And, uh, also
i don't know how.

13:10.389 --> 13:11.556
Nice throw.

13:13.526 --> 13:17.262
How can you not
know how to drive
in Los Angeles?

13:17.264 --> 13:19.798
A man should know
how to drive.

13:19.800 --> 13:21.065
I have a bicycle.

13:21.067 --> 13:23.034
Oh, well,
congrats on that.

13:23.036 --> 13:26.471
Yeah, it's actually
considered very masculine
in the Netherlands.

13:26.473 --> 13:31.376
You know, hey,
i haven't really been
in touch with ginnie recently,

13:31.378 --> 13:33.111
so...
So?

13:33.113 --> 13:35.413
So I might not come in.
Fine by me.

13:35.415 --> 13:37.348
You know, not that
we're not friends.

13:37.350 --> 13:39.150
You know, we're still friends.
I think we're still friends.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.485
We're still friends
on Facebook. That--

13:40.487 --> 13:42.153
Martin,
where are we going?

13:42.155 --> 13:45.423
Oh, uh, it's just
up ahead that-a-way

13:45.425 --> 13:47.559
and a second left
at the light.

13:59.872 --> 14:03.007
It's one of these.

14:03.009 --> 14:04.876
I can never tell which.

14:05.611 --> 14:07.278
They all look the same.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.881
Voice mail's
still full.

14:10.883 --> 14:12.483
It's gotta be this one.

14:17.991 --> 14:19.457
I hear fighting.

14:19.459 --> 14:21.092
This is definitely it.

14:25.899 --> 14:28.466
Okay, well, write it down,
like, on the dry erase!

14:28.468 --> 14:30.134
'Cause Saturday's
my day!

14:30.136 --> 14:32.203
Shit. Hey. Hey,
how's it going, man?

14:32.205 --> 14:33.438
Um--
Gary.

14:33.440 --> 14:34.906
Yeah, hey, Martin.
Hi.

14:34.908 --> 14:37.175
Sorry to just
drop by like this.

14:37.177 --> 14:39.177
Yeah, it--
it really is--

14:39.179 --> 14:41.112
we're looking
for my daughter.

14:41.114 --> 14:42.247
Ginnie.
Oh.

14:42.249 --> 14:44.415
This is her father,
Mr. gallo.

14:44.417 --> 14:46.351
Uh, he didn't have
her new address.

14:46.353 --> 14:47.352
She, um--

14:47.354 --> 14:49.487
Martin, hi.

14:49.489 --> 14:51.089
Oh.

14:51.091 --> 14:54.292
Uh, they--
they're looking
for ginnie, babe.

14:54.294 --> 14:55.493
Um, this is
ginnie's dad.

14:55.495 --> 14:58.496
I'm Roberta. So great
to finally meet you.

14:58.498 --> 14:59.898
Jack, right?

14:59.900 --> 15:02.200
That would be
ginnie's stepfather.

15:02.202 --> 15:04.269
Right. Well, don't worry.

15:04.271 --> 15:06.104
She's talked a lot
about you, too.

15:07.507 --> 15:10.074
Did you invite them in?

15:10.076 --> 15:12.977
I literally just
opened the door.

15:14.014 --> 15:15.480
Come in. Come in.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.548
Yeah, come on in. Yeah.

15:17.550 --> 15:19.550
After you.
Yeah, welcome,
welcome.

15:19.552 --> 15:21.419
<i> Mi casa--</i>
heh heh.

15:21.421 --> 15:23.988
Roberta:
Uh, could I get you
something to drink?

15:23.990 --> 15:26.057
Water or kombucha?

15:26.059 --> 15:27.158
Twig tea?

15:27.160 --> 15:29.227
I have some nice
biodynamic wine.

15:29.229 --> 15:31.496
Don't bother.
Please, we're just
looking for ginnie.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.264
Martin said she
was staying here.

15:33.266 --> 15:34.465
She was
staying here.

15:34.467 --> 15:36.534
Uh, she left about
three weeks ago.

15:36.536 --> 15:38.102
Did you
try her cell?

15:38.104 --> 15:41.639
Phone is off,
mailbox full
for a couple days now.

15:41.641 --> 15:43.207
Gary: Oh, man,
sounds to me

15:43.209 --> 15:45.176
like she's living
off the grid, you know?

15:45.178 --> 15:48.479
Martin, was ginnie,
like, a survivalist,
you know?

15:48.481 --> 15:50.048
Like one
of those preppers

15:50.050 --> 15:51.983
or--
Gary, stop talking.

15:51.985 --> 15:55.086
Do you know
where she moved
when she left here?

15:55.088 --> 15:56.387
Yes. Um...

15:56.389 --> 15:58.122
Ohh. Ahh.

15:58.124 --> 15:59.390
What was
her name?

15:59.392 --> 16:01.426
Martin,
you know her.

16:01.428 --> 16:03.962
Um,
the jittery girl.

16:03.964 --> 16:06.397
Always looks like
she's about to cry.
You know her.

16:06.399 --> 16:09.634
Mm, doesn't, uh,
ring a bell.

16:09.636 --> 16:11.636
Okay, did ginnie
leave an address?

16:11.638 --> 16:12.704
Roberta: Yes.

16:12.706 --> 16:15.006
I think it's
on the fridge.

16:15.008 --> 16:17.342
Uh, Gary,
could you
get it, please?

16:20.246 --> 16:21.980
Please come in.

16:26.085 --> 16:28.086
Gary: Uh,
I'm not seeing it.

16:28.088 --> 16:29.721
It's on the fridge!
No, it isn't!

16:29.723 --> 16:31.589
It's definitely
on the fridge.

16:31.591 --> 16:33.057
I just checked there.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.659
Jesus. Sorry.
Excuse me.

16:34.661 --> 16:36.027
There's no address
on the fridge.

16:36.029 --> 16:37.595
It's on
the Japanese paper.

16:37.597 --> 16:39.597
Yeah, no.
I know you think
it's there,

16:39.599 --> 16:41.566
but it's not there.
On the Japanese paper. Christ.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.034
Roberta:
Get out of my way.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.435
Fine. I don't know
how to look.

16:44.437 --> 16:45.503
It's not there.

16:46.705 --> 16:48.573
You sure you guys
don't want anything,

16:48.575 --> 16:49.574
like a-- like a beer?

16:49.576 --> 16:52.210
Sure.
I could do a beer.

16:52.212 --> 16:54.112
Ah, you know, uh,

16:54.114 --> 16:55.546
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.382
Uh, how have
you been, Gary?

16:57.384 --> 17:00.451
I've been, um--

17:00.453 --> 17:02.286
work's good.
Work's good. Yeah.

17:02.288 --> 17:03.788
Gary,
where's the tub

17:03.790 --> 17:06.391
where we, uh,
keep the receipts?

17:06.393 --> 17:08.226
What tub?
I-- I don't know.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.461
Excuse me. Sorry.
I need to help her out.

17:10.463 --> 17:12.096
What tub are you ta--
the tin?

17:12.098 --> 17:13.531
That's a tin.
That's not a tub.

17:13.532 --> 17:15.767
Tub, tin, whatever.
No, I don't know.

17:15.769 --> 17:17.602
Can I help you find
what you're looking for?

17:17.604 --> 17:19.037
Go-- go check
the drawer.

17:19.039 --> 17:19.804
What drawer?

17:19.806 --> 17:21.305
The odds-and-ends
drawer.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.807
All right, I'm just
saying be specific.

17:22.809 --> 17:24.442
We'll find it.

17:24.444 --> 17:26.444
Can I get
you guys something?

17:26.445 --> 17:28.780
Are you sure?
Something to drink
or cheese?

17:28.782 --> 17:30.348
We have nice cheese.

17:30.350 --> 17:32.617
Oh, we're out
of the cheese, babe.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.485
Since when?

17:34.487 --> 17:36.254
Since we
finished it.

17:36.256 --> 17:37.688
I didn't finish
the cheese,

17:37.690 --> 17:39.123
so don't say "we."

17:39.125 --> 17:40.425
I was gonna freeze it

17:40.427 --> 17:42.460
for my doula workshop
next month.

17:42.462 --> 17:44.796
It's okay.
We don't need cheese.

17:44.798 --> 17:46.197
Someone finished
the cheese, I guess.

17:46.199 --> 17:48.066
Yeah, someone was hungry
in their house,

17:48.068 --> 17:49.667
and they ate cheese.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.135
They ate it all,
though.

17:51.137 --> 17:52.203
It's okay.

17:52.205 --> 17:53.738
Have you
seen ginnie recently?

17:53.740 --> 17:55.173
Brother.

17:55.175 --> 17:56.741
I certainly
have not.

17:56.743 --> 17:59.177
We love ginnie.

17:59.179 --> 18:00.478
Don't get me wrong.

18:00.480 --> 18:03.848
But some of us
loved her a little
too much,

18:03.850 --> 18:06.250
if you know
what I mean,

18:06.252 --> 18:07.552
and some things
got said.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.821
Yeah, some things
got said. You said 'em.

18:09.823 --> 18:11.622
Yeah, I said 'em, all right.
Yeah.

18:11.624 --> 18:13.157
'Cause someone had
to say something,

18:13.159 --> 18:14.625
'cause a certain someone
in this house

18:14.627 --> 18:16.260
wanted to have sex
with his daughter.

18:16.262 --> 18:17.595
Okay, what?
Excuse me?

18:17.597 --> 18:19.197
No?
No. No, Mr. gallo,

18:19.199 --> 18:22.166
you know that
your daughter
is very attractive.

18:22.168 --> 18:23.734
And unfortunately,
in this house,

18:23.736 --> 18:26.537
that makes certain people
very insecure.

18:26.539 --> 18:30.141
Okay, let me translate
for Mr. sensitivity
over here.

18:30.143 --> 18:32.643
Ginnie was getting
a little sick and tired

18:32.645 --> 18:35.313
of being leered at
every time she went
to the fridge.

18:35.315 --> 18:38.416
It was one time, and i
was trying to warn her
about the bad milk!

18:38.418 --> 18:40.418
Mr. gallo, Martin,
ginnie was going

18:40.420 --> 18:42.386
for some bad milk
in the fridge,

18:42.388 --> 18:46.557
so I was peering to see
what she was grabbing
from the fridge,

18:46.559 --> 18:48.793
in order to say,
"hey, don't ingest that,
yeah.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.262
'Cause you might get sick."
I was doing a service.

18:51.264 --> 18:53.397
You're a knight
in shining armor,
aren't you, gare?

18:53.399 --> 18:55.500
Here's an idea.
Maybe you could
sort it out with them

18:55.502 --> 18:56.667
at your favorite
strip joint...

18:56.669 --> 18:59.270
Ohh! That happened
at a bachelor party!

18:59.272 --> 19:01.539
They're strippers!
They climb all over you!

19:01.541 --> 19:03.341
You can't stop them!
You guys know!

19:03.343 --> 19:04.742
They're-- they're like
monkeys at a zoo!

19:04.744 --> 19:06.244
Can't stop 'em.

19:06.246 --> 19:07.478
The monkeys
climb all over you
at a zoo?

19:07.480 --> 19:08.679
Really?
Interesting zoo.

19:08.681 --> 19:11.415
Okay, we should
probably get going.

19:11.417 --> 19:12.750
If you find
that address,

19:12.752 --> 19:14.552
you could give me
a shout, that'd be great.

19:14.554 --> 19:15.553
We'll find it.

19:15.555 --> 19:16.654
Don't worry.
Thank you.

19:16.656 --> 19:19.423
I'm so sorry
about the cheese.

19:19.425 --> 19:21.692
You know,
it was very
expensive cheese.

19:21.694 --> 19:24.595
Jesus, Roberta,
he doesn't care
about the goddamn cheese.

19:24.597 --> 19:27.431
You, uh, might want
to try the cafe.

19:27.433 --> 19:28.733
Martin knows
where it is.

19:28.735 --> 19:29.867
She's probably
working there.

19:29.869 --> 19:31.235
The cafe?
Roberta: Yeah.

19:31.237 --> 19:33.204
Great. Martin?

19:33.206 --> 19:34.305
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

19:34.307 --> 19:36.307
Uh, all right.
Well, thanks, guys.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.276
Thank you for...

19:38.278 --> 19:40.578
That. All right.

19:42.514 --> 19:44.415
Why do you
have to attack me?

19:44.417 --> 19:46.417
Why are you--
have to be so hostile?

19:46.419 --> 19:48.219
And now
i completely lost face.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.189
I gotta go apologize
for something
i didn't even do.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.623
Hey, ma-Martin.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.925
Are we cool, man?

19:53.927 --> 19:55.626
Are we-- I just
want you to know

19:55.628 --> 19:56.727
truly--
yeah, no.

19:56.729 --> 19:57.828
Bro, I would never...

19:57.830 --> 19:59.230
Gary, it's fine.

19:59.232 --> 20:00.965
I mean, you know,
we're not even--

20:00.967 --> 20:02.233
I know. We're not,

20:02.235 --> 20:03.968
but still,
i promise you on my--

20:03.970 --> 20:05.937
I wouldn't--
and, Mr. gallo,

20:05.939 --> 20:07.705
I would never--
okay. Yeah, good.

20:07.707 --> 20:08.906
I'll rest easy now.

20:08.908 --> 20:11.275
You guys are the best.
Hey, try the cafe.

20:11.277 --> 20:12.577
She's probably there,
all right?

20:12.579 --> 20:14.545
Hey, and tell her
Gary says, "what's up?"

20:14.547 --> 20:17.315
Okay, so you just wanna
go straight until sunset,

20:17.317 --> 20:18.716
and then you
make a right,

20:18.718 --> 20:20.318
and, uh,
you can't miss it.

20:20.320 --> 20:21.652
Um, before you
drop me off,

20:21.654 --> 20:23.387
I can draw you
a little map.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.256
What, are you
dora the explorer?

20:25.258 --> 20:26.691
Fuck that.
You're coming with.

20:26.693 --> 20:27.692
Yeah.

20:27.694 --> 20:28.960
I would love to.

20:28.962 --> 20:30.828
Just apparently I have
a show coming up,

20:30.830 --> 20:32.363
and I really need
to rehearse.

20:32.365 --> 20:33.631
I'll pay you, okay?

20:33.633 --> 20:36.701
Pay me? Uh, no, no.
I don't, um--

20:36.703 --> 20:39.303
you don't, what,
need the money?

20:39.305 --> 20:40.571
I beg to differ.

20:40.573 --> 20:41.772
Look, Martin,

20:41.774 --> 20:43.507
I'll be straight
with you.

20:43.509 --> 20:44.875
I'm worried here,
okay?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.877
This is not
like my daughter

20:46.879 --> 20:49.680
to just disappear
like this.

20:49.682 --> 20:51.949
If you care
about her at all,

20:51.951 --> 20:55.419
I would think
you would want to know
if she's okay or not.

20:56.788 --> 20:58.556
I do. I do.

20:58.558 --> 21:00.858
Of course I do.

21:00.860 --> 21:01.926
Okay.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.429
Tell me
when to turn.

21:18.377 --> 21:19.944
This is where
my daughter works?

21:19.946 --> 21:21.879
Yeah. It's--
it's not that bad.

21:21.881 --> 21:23.781
They got
a little gallery now.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.516
It was ginnie's idea,
actually.

21:25.518 --> 21:27.318
Really turned
the place around.

21:32.025 --> 21:34.425
Nothing. Two dudes
just came in here.

21:34.427 --> 21:35.726
You know this one?

21:35.728 --> 21:37.928
Yeah. Tracy.

21:39.299 --> 21:40.898
You're the slut.

21:40.900 --> 21:43.601
The old one, maybe.

21:44.670 --> 21:46.070
You're gross.

21:46.072 --> 21:47.972
I have to go.

21:47.974 --> 21:49.774
Call me if it
doesn't stop bleeding.

21:51.543 --> 21:53.444
Tracy, hi.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.446
Uh, it's Martin.

21:55.448 --> 21:57.014
Remember me?

21:57.016 --> 21:58.382
No.

21:58.384 --> 21:59.517
Uh, ginnie's boyfriend.

21:59.519 --> 22:00.951
Ex-boyfriend.

22:00.953 --> 22:03.020
Is ginnie
working today?

22:03.022 --> 22:04.689
Ginnie doesn't
work here anymore.

22:04.691 --> 22:05.723
What? Since when?

22:05.725 --> 22:08.359
Since none
of your business.

22:08.361 --> 22:09.994
I'm her father...

22:09.996 --> 22:11.629
Trying to find her.

22:11.631 --> 22:14.031
Oh. She quit, like,
a month ago, maybe.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.067
Do you know where
she's working now?

22:16.069 --> 22:18.469
I think she works
at some restaurant.

22:18.471 --> 22:20.037
Lizzie, our manager,
would know,

22:20.039 --> 22:22.440
but she's at moglu
right now.

22:22.442 --> 22:25.843
Moglu? The yoga place,
right, on hyperion?

22:25.845 --> 22:27.845
Did you check
her Facebook?

22:27.847 --> 22:29.513
Checked her Facebook.
Twitter?

22:29.515 --> 22:31.015
Twitter. Yeah.

22:31.017 --> 22:32.750
You tweet something,
will you?

22:32.752 --> 22:35.486
Oh, I don't--
i don't Twitter--

22:35.488 --> 22:37.822
or tweet or,
you know, twit.

22:37.824 --> 22:39.557
'Course you don't.

22:39.559 --> 22:42.059
Look, um, Tracy,
would you mind

22:42.061 --> 22:43.394
just putting
something out there--

22:43.396 --> 22:45.029
I already did it.
You-- you did what?

22:45.031 --> 22:46.397
I tweeted it.

22:46.399 --> 22:47.932
Great. What--
what did you tweet?

22:49.034 --> 22:52.103
"Baller old guy,
creepy young guy

22:52.105 --> 22:55.973
looking for ginnie g.
#random #doable."

22:55.975 --> 22:58.776
I'm creepy?
W-why am I creepy?

22:58.778 --> 23:01.979
I've met her many times,
many times.

23:01.981 --> 23:04.382
Yeah. She seemed
like she-- was she stoned?

23:04.384 --> 23:05.616
Is this whole
neighborhood stoned?

23:05.618 --> 23:07.418
Uh, maybe she
was stoned.

23:07.420 --> 23:09.954
You know, this--
this neighborhood's
probably 70% stoned,

23:09.956 --> 23:11.989
80% on a Sunday.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.058
All right,
where's the yoga place?

23:14.060 --> 23:16.861
Uh, just that-a-way.

23:33.044 --> 23:34.879
So, uh, where'd you say
you were coming from?

23:34.881 --> 23:36.180
Mumbai.

23:36.182 --> 23:37.481
Oh, Mumbai!

23:37.483 --> 23:38.616
Yeah. Ever been?

23:38.618 --> 23:40.885
Uh, no, no.
But i-I'd like to.

23:40.887 --> 23:42.019
It's a shithole.

23:42.021 --> 23:43.721
Huh. Huh.

23:43.723 --> 23:48.559
Well, I guess I can, uh,
cross that off the list then.

23:53.866 --> 23:55.533
I need to take this.

23:55.535 --> 23:57.001
Okay.

23:57.003 --> 23:58.936
Barry.
Talk to me.

24:02.107 --> 24:03.908
Yeah, yeah.
Thanks again for coming.

24:08.146 --> 24:09.513
Hey, Lizzie.

24:09.515 --> 24:10.514
Martin.

24:10.516 --> 24:11.949
What are you doing here?

24:11.951 --> 24:14.051
Uh...
Please,

24:14.053 --> 24:15.853
please do not fuck
with my yoga buzz.

24:15.855 --> 24:17.855
No. No, uh...

24:17.857 --> 24:19.857
I was just wondering--
I've been looking for ginnie.

24:19.859 --> 24:22.059
Martin,
Martin, Martin...

24:22.061 --> 24:25.496
Martin, you've
got to get over
this ginnie thing.

24:25.498 --> 24:27.698
She's moving on.
You should, too.

24:27.700 --> 24:30.601
Uh, what do you mean,
she's moving on? What...

24:30.603 --> 24:31.936
Okay, everything
is in place.

24:33.139 --> 24:35.072
Barry, look, my phone
is about to die.

24:35.074 --> 24:36.807
Okay, Barry,
stop talking.

24:36.809 --> 24:39.610
I don't think
this is the best move
for you, Martin,

24:39.612 --> 24:42.880
but if you need
some kind of closure
or whatever,

24:42.882 --> 24:44.548
she's hostessing
at bibola.

24:44.550 --> 24:46.484
Bibola? What's that?

24:46.486 --> 24:48.252
It's a restaurant,
Martin.

24:48.254 --> 24:51.822
It's the new,
hot big restaurant
in west Hollywood.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.259
Fuck! My yoga buzz
is gone now.

24:55.261 --> 24:57.261
Okay. Well, thanks
for the info, Lizzie.
Shit.

24:57.263 --> 24:58.863
Yeah, Martin,
you should know that--

24:58.865 --> 25:01.532
oh, and by the way, good job.
You know, keep it up.

25:01.534 --> 25:03.133
What the hell
does that mean,
"good job"?

25:03.135 --> 25:04.735
No, I didn't
mean it like-- like--

25:04.737 --> 25:06.237
what did you mean?
I mean, like, yoga.

25:06.239 --> 25:07.605
You know, like
"good job, yoga."

25:07.607 --> 25:08.606
Uh-huh.
Like, you look great.

25:08.608 --> 25:09.607
Fuck off, Martin. Okay?

25:09.609 --> 25:10.641
Absolutely. Yeah.
Thank you.

25:10.643 --> 25:11.642
Good-bye.

25:11.644 --> 25:13.177
You're an asshole.

25:13.179 --> 25:14.245
Stop talking, Barry.

25:14.247 --> 25:16.780
Just do your fucking job,
okay?

25:16.782 --> 25:21.552
She said ginnie's
working at a restaurant
in west Hollywood.

25:21.554 --> 25:22.620
Let's go.

25:23.955 --> 25:24.955
Frank.

25:24.957 --> 25:26.757
Wow.
Kelly.

25:26.759 --> 25:28.759
Hi. Hi.

25:28.761 --> 25:30.828
It's been a minute.

25:30.830 --> 25:32.997
Are you in town
for a visit?

25:32.999 --> 25:35.566
Yeah, just popped in.
You look good.

25:35.568 --> 25:37.801
I'm a sweaty mess,
but thank you.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.570
You look good.

25:39.572 --> 25:41.005
How long are you
in town for?

25:41.007 --> 25:42.840
Very briefly.

25:42.842 --> 25:45.843
Uh, I'm sorry.
We're late to meet
my daughter, so...

25:45.845 --> 25:48.245
Oh. Oh, I won't--
i won't keep you, then.

25:48.247 --> 25:50.848
Well, it was, uh--
it was good to see you.

25:50.850 --> 25:51.949
You, too.

25:51.951 --> 25:53.784
So if you end up
sticking around,

25:53.786 --> 25:55.319
give me a shout.
Will do.

25:55.321 --> 25:56.654
Take care, Kelly.
Bye.

25:59.691 --> 26:02.026
You're gonna catch flies
there, Kermit. Come on.

26:02.028 --> 26:04.728
Was that that waitress
from that night
we all had dinner?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.063
I don't know, maybe.
So what?

26:06.065 --> 26:07.765
No, i-- nothing.
I mean, you know,

26:07.767 --> 26:09.867
you must have made
quite an impression on her.

26:09.869 --> 26:12.136
Where we going?
Uh, it's just up that-a-way.

26:12.138 --> 26:15.005
That's gotta be
the 15th fucking time
you said "that-a-way."

26:15.007 --> 26:16.340
Are you
hopalong Cassidy?

26:16.342 --> 26:17.875
Who's hopalong Cassidy?

26:19.110 --> 26:20.911
Ha-- get in the car.

26:24.049 --> 26:26.283
I thought there was
a little something
going on that night.

26:26.285 --> 26:27.851
Forget about it.

26:27.853 --> 26:31.021
No, I know. I know.
It's none of my business.

26:31.023 --> 26:32.856
She's very attractive.

26:32.858 --> 26:35.693
Yes. She's
an attractive woman.

26:35.695 --> 26:37.061
Okay? Deal with it.

26:37.063 --> 26:39.163
Very attractive.

26:39.165 --> 26:40.698
So how did that work?

26:40.700 --> 26:41.999
Did she slip you
her number--

26:42.001 --> 26:43.834
would you fucking
forget about it?
Please?

26:43.836 --> 26:47.237
Jesus.
Okay, okay. Yeesh.

26:49.809 --> 26:50.975
nice.

26:50.977 --> 26:52.109
Sweet.

26:54.279 --> 26:55.846
You like Bob seger?

26:55.848 --> 26:58.649
Yeah. I love Bob seger.

26:58.651 --> 27:00.951
"Beautiful loser,"
"stranger in town,"

27:00.953 --> 27:03.253
those are some
of my favorite albums ever.

27:06.759 --> 27:08.626
might be hope
for you yet.

27:26.378 --> 27:28.712
Maitre d' says
she quit about 10 days ago

27:28.714 --> 27:30.748
all of a sudden,
has no idea why.

27:30.750 --> 27:32.316
She only worked here
two weeks.

27:32.318 --> 27:34.318
That is pretty weird.

27:34.320 --> 27:36.353
Yeah, it is.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.159
Well,
want to grab a bite?

27:42.161 --> 27:43.227
Here?

27:43.229 --> 27:44.428
Sure. Why not?

27:44.430 --> 27:46.096
Gotta refuel, right?

27:46.098 --> 27:48.365
I mean,
you must be starving.
Let me buy you dinner.

27:48.367 --> 27:51.135
That's very nice of you.

27:51.137 --> 27:53.070
I guess
i am pretty hungry.

27:53.072 --> 27:54.204
Good.

27:56.942 --> 27:58.909
Oh, yeah, ginnie.

27:58.911 --> 28:00.344
Yeah, I love ginnie.
Ginnie's great.

28:00.346 --> 28:01.979
I was bummed
when she quit.

28:01.981 --> 28:04.181
But I think maybe
she got a better job.

28:04.183 --> 28:05.983
You know where?
I don't.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.117
But I can ask around.

28:07.119 --> 28:10.354
In the meantime, can i
get you anything to start?

28:10.356 --> 28:12.256
I think we'll skip
straight to the entree.

28:12.258 --> 28:13.457
We're in a bit
of a rush.

28:13.459 --> 28:14.992
I'll take the, uh,
steak-frites, rare.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.394
I guess I'll have, uh--

28:17.396 --> 28:19.997
you know what?
I'll get what he's getting,

28:19.999 --> 28:20.998
uh, the-- the steak.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.966
Excellent. Rare as well?

28:22.968 --> 28:25.035
Uh, yeah, yeah, rare.

28:25.037 --> 28:27.438
Very good.

28:31.943 --> 28:35.012
This place
is pretty, uh, chichi.

28:35.014 --> 28:36.914
Yeah, for you, I guess,

28:36.916 --> 28:39.450
eating tofu
out of a paper bag
or whatever.

28:39.452 --> 28:42.119
That is how i
usually eat, actually.

28:45.423 --> 28:46.857
She'll turn up,
Mr. gallo.

28:46.859 --> 28:48.492
She will.

28:48.494 --> 28:50.994
Have you, um...

28:50.996 --> 28:54.098
Talked to ginnie's mom?
No.

28:54.100 --> 28:57.101
I was just thinking, uh,
maybe she's heard from her.

28:57.103 --> 28:58.836
I don't want
to worry her.

28:58.838 --> 29:00.104
Right, but, you know,

29:00.106 --> 29:01.505
they're pretty close.

29:01.507 --> 29:03.507
I mean, maybe she
knows where she is.

29:03.509 --> 29:05.042
And what if she doesn't?

29:05.044 --> 29:06.443
Then she's in a panic.

29:06.445 --> 29:08.212
And whose fault is that?

29:09.114 --> 29:10.347
Yours?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.816
Well, no,
it would be yours,
actually,

29:12.818 --> 29:14.885
because it's your idea.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.922
Maybe she lost her phone.
If she lost her phone,

29:18.924 --> 29:20.758
then she wouldn't
get your messages.

29:20.760 --> 29:23.761
Martin, I get that
you think I'm being
paranoid here, okay?

29:23.763 --> 29:25.796
But believe me,
shit happens every day.

29:26.765 --> 29:28.132
Friend of mine's
daughter

29:28.134 --> 29:29.333
takes a little trip
to Europe.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.768
She gets grabbed
20 minutes out of orly.

29:30.770 --> 29:32.102
Jesus.
Yeah.

29:32.104 --> 29:33.904
Lucky for them
i know a thing or two

29:33.906 --> 29:36.140
about a thing or two.
I was able to
get her back.

29:36.142 --> 29:38.108
A thing or two?
I know how to handle

29:38.110 --> 29:40.177
a situation like that,
let's just say.

29:40.179 --> 29:41.178
Wait. Like those
Liam neeson movies?

29:41.180 --> 29:42.446
What?
You know,

29:42.448 --> 29:43.947
those Liam neeson movies.

29:43.949 --> 29:46.383
His-- his daughter
gets kidnapped or his wife.

29:46.385 --> 29:48.452
This is not a movie,
Martin. This is life.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.289
What-- what is so funny?

29:52.291 --> 29:53.991
Oh, just, uh--

29:53.993 --> 29:56.260
it just reminds me of--

29:56.262 --> 29:59.163
ginnie could never
explain what you do.

29:59.165 --> 30:01.431
It always seemed
so mysterious to us.

30:01.433 --> 30:04.434
We used to joke
that you were a, uh,

30:04.436 --> 30:09.473
um, an arms dealer
or something, you know,
something badass.

30:09.475 --> 30:11.508
Well,
something like that,

30:11.510 --> 30:13.277
but not quite
so glamorous, I guess.

30:14.412 --> 30:16.880
So what is it that
you do, exactly, then?

30:17.949 --> 30:19.583
I'm in procurement.

30:22.253 --> 30:23.253
Okay.

30:23.255 --> 30:24.488
Huh.

30:25.523 --> 30:27.524
Procurement.

30:27.526 --> 30:30.227
So what about you?
How's it going
with the music?

30:30.229 --> 30:33.831
Well, I guess I've got
that show coming up

30:33.833 --> 30:35.399
with my band,

30:35.401 --> 30:38.602
but I'm not sure
that I want to do it.

30:38.604 --> 30:40.170
Not sure?

30:40.172 --> 30:41.438
Well,
what's the issue?

30:41.440 --> 30:43.207
Well, it's been a while,

30:43.209 --> 30:44.575
and I guess
I've been trying

30:44.577 --> 30:46.577
to figure some stuff out
actually. I mean...

30:48.146 --> 30:49.513
Finally hit me.

30:49.515 --> 30:52.182
What's the endgame?

30:52.184 --> 30:54.484
I mean, I'm probably
never gonna make...

30:54.486 --> 30:56.220
A real living at it,

30:56.222 --> 30:58.222
or at least one
decent enough

30:58.224 --> 31:00.357
to support a family or...

31:02.393 --> 31:04.394
Are you good at it?

31:05.463 --> 31:07.598
Yeah, I am.

31:07.600 --> 31:09.967
Then you should
play the show.

31:12.270 --> 31:13.937
Waiter: Here we are.

31:13.939 --> 31:17.474
No luck on the ginnie front,
I'm sorry to say.

31:17.476 --> 31:19.142
Well,
thanks for trying.

31:19.144 --> 31:21.111
You know,
it is Thursday, though.

31:21.113 --> 31:22.946
You know, you might
want to try rococo.

31:22.948 --> 31:25.349
You know her friend trev?
He's awesome.

31:25.351 --> 31:26.950
He's been djing there
every Thursday.

31:26.952 --> 31:28.886
Yeah, I know Trevor.

31:28.888 --> 31:30.220
You know the place?

31:31.322 --> 31:32.389
Enjoy your meal.

31:37.428 --> 31:38.629
Dig in.

31:43.402 --> 31:44.601
You okay there, bub?

31:47.273 --> 31:49.306
It's been a while
since I ate meat.

31:49.308 --> 31:51.508
Yeah. Like how long?

31:51.510 --> 31:53.644
Oh, three...

31:53.646 --> 31:55.412
Maybe five years.

31:55.414 --> 31:57.414
Nobody made you order it.

31:57.416 --> 32:00.183
Tell you what, let's go
to that rococo place,

32:00.185 --> 32:02.152
get a drink,
settle your stomach, huh?

32:03.421 --> 32:05.622
I guess one drink
couldn't hurt.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.393
If not, maybe you
can point out somebody
that knows her, huh?

32:09.395 --> 32:11.395
You're the boss.
Now you're getting it.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.007
This place is impossible.

32:24.009 --> 32:25.475
We're never getting in.

32:25.477 --> 32:27.945
What, are you
kidding me? Come on.

32:34.385 --> 32:35.986
Where are you...

32:45.030 --> 32:46.096
All right.

32:51.402 --> 32:52.669
He's with me.

32:54.439 --> 32:55.706
Have a good night.

33:00.211 --> 33:01.645
How'd you do that?

33:01.647 --> 33:03.380
I spoke
the guy's language.

33:03.382 --> 33:04.648
What-- what was it,
samoan?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.316
What,
you spoke samoan?

33:06.318 --> 33:10.153
Dennis said
he hadn't seen her,
but you never know.

33:10.155 --> 33:13.590
Dennis? You spoke
to that guy for,
like, three seconds.

33:13.592 --> 33:15.225
Martin, look around.

33:15.227 --> 33:18.028
See if you can spot
anyone who knows ginnie.

33:18.030 --> 33:19.496
No, I don't know,
Mr. gallo.

33:19.498 --> 33:21.298
This really
doesn't look like
her kind of crowd.

33:23.067 --> 33:25.102
Come on.
Let's get that drink.

33:31.275 --> 33:32.275
Two taliskers, neat.

33:32.277 --> 33:33.343
You got it.

33:34.645 --> 33:36.113
See anything?

33:36.115 --> 33:38.115
No.

33:38.117 --> 33:39.182
There you go.

33:49.494 --> 33:51.161
I think I, uh...

33:51.163 --> 33:52.396
Good.

34:05.109 --> 34:07.210
Hey, Megan.

34:07.212 --> 34:09.413
Oh, my god. Martin!

34:09.415 --> 34:10.679
Megan!

34:10.681 --> 34:12.783
What the fuck
are you doing here?

34:12.784 --> 34:14.518
I'm looking for ginnie,
actually.

34:14.520 --> 34:17.154
Oh, Martin,
you gotta get over it.

34:17.156 --> 34:18.755
It's so sad, like--

34:18.757 --> 34:20.657
no, I'm-- I'm over it.

34:20.659 --> 34:24.061
Uh, it's just her dad is
looking for her, actually.

34:24.063 --> 34:26.329
Do you-- do you know if she's
gonna be here tonight?

34:26.331 --> 34:28.130
What?
Do you know

34:28.132 --> 34:29.533
if she's
coming here tonight?

34:29.534 --> 34:31.201
Who?
Ginnie!

34:31.203 --> 34:34.204
Get over it, Martin!

34:34.206 --> 34:35.839
'Kay.

34:35.841 --> 34:37.774
Oh, wow.

34:37.775 --> 34:40.210
She's very drunk.

34:40.212 --> 34:41.478
Yeah. Hey, uh, Lois.

34:41.480 --> 34:42.478
Right?
Yeah.

34:42.481 --> 34:43.847
Yeah. Martin, right?

34:43.849 --> 34:45.215
Yes! Thank you!

34:45.217 --> 34:46.583
Oh, sorry?

34:46.585 --> 34:49.753
I just, uh--
have you seen ginnie
by any chance?

34:49.755 --> 34:50.786
I'm sorry. Who?

34:50.789 --> 34:53.090
Ginnie,
my ex-girlfriend.

34:53.092 --> 34:54.291
Yeah.
No, I haven't seen her.

34:54.293 --> 34:56.659
Sorry.
It's so loud in here.

34:56.661 --> 34:59.096
I know.
It's unbelievably loud in here.

34:59.098 --> 35:00.831
I feel like
I'm screaming at you.

35:00.833 --> 35:02.466
It probably looks
like we're having

35:02.468 --> 35:03.800
a horrible,
horrible argument.

35:03.802 --> 35:06.169
Fuck you, you fucking asshole!

35:06.171 --> 35:08.238
I swear to fucking god!

35:08.240 --> 35:09.840
Woman: Uh,
what was that?

35:11.276 --> 35:12.776
I'm sorry.

35:12.778 --> 35:14.578
Oh.
I'm sorry. I was kidding.

35:14.580 --> 35:16.246
It was a joke
about arguments.

35:16.248 --> 35:18.548
Oh, man. Good. Good.

35:18.550 --> 35:19.783
I probably went too far.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.451
No.
Sorry.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.487
I don't think
I've seen her in here
for a few weeks.

35:23.489 --> 35:25.188
Is she missing
or something?

35:25.190 --> 35:26.356
Something like that.

35:26.358 --> 35:28.725
This one's on the house
all right?

35:28.727 --> 35:30.260
Thank you.
You know,

35:30.262 --> 35:32.562
you ought to talk
to that guy she's seeing.

35:32.564 --> 35:34.865
She's seeing somebody?

35:34.867 --> 35:37.567
Yeah, cute guy, too,
a big tipper.

35:37.569 --> 35:38.768
They met here, I think.

35:38.770 --> 35:40.237
You seen him lately?

35:40.239 --> 35:41.738
No. I haven't seen
either of 'em.

35:41.740 --> 35:42.806
Just a second.

35:43.875 --> 35:46.309
So do you
come here often?

35:46.311 --> 35:47.544
No, never.

35:47.546 --> 35:49.279
It's a little bit
too, like--

35:49.281 --> 35:50.313
axe body spray?

35:50.315 --> 35:52.682
Yes.
Hey, I heard you guys

35:52.684 --> 35:54.484
are playing
this weekend, right?

35:54.486 --> 35:56.319
Yeah. Uh...

35:56.321 --> 35:58.588
I don't know
if that's gonna happen.

35:58.590 --> 36:02.292
Yeah, I saw you play,
like-- like a year ago
at the river room.

36:02.294 --> 36:04.394
You were really good,
kind of like...

36:04.396 --> 36:06.263
The punch brothers
meets, like,

36:06.265 --> 36:08.865
the foggy mountain boys
meets, like, the muppets.

36:09.834 --> 36:11.468
Yeah, thanks, I think.

36:11.470 --> 36:13.270
That's at least
partially what--
exactly what--

36:13.272 --> 36:14.304
man: Marty?

36:14.306 --> 36:16.673
Hey, Trevor.

36:16.675 --> 36:18.375
They let you
in here?

36:18.377 --> 36:20.744
Yeah. Well, you know,
Dennis is a friend, so...

36:20.746 --> 36:21.745
Oh man.

36:21.747 --> 36:23.480
I know this guy!

36:23.482 --> 36:25.248
He's an idiot!

36:25.250 --> 36:28.185
Hey, um, I think
my friend is leaving,
so I have to go.

36:28.187 --> 36:30.187
Okay. And if I do
play that show,

36:30.189 --> 36:31.922
uh, maybe I'll
see you there.

36:31.924 --> 36:32.923
Yeah. Good to see you.

36:32.925 --> 36:34.891
Bye-bye.
Bye.

36:44.235 --> 36:47.370
Listen, Trevor,
have you seen
ginnie recently?

36:47.372 --> 36:48.572
Uh, yeah, I'm just
gonna do you a solid

36:48.574 --> 36:50.774
and not even
answer that, bro.

36:50.776 --> 36:52.576
I don't know
what your problem
is with me.

36:52.578 --> 36:54.377
Hey, I told you guys
about Marty here, right?

36:54.379 --> 36:56.479
He plays old-timey music
on his banjo

36:56.481 --> 36:58.615
like he's old McDonald
or some shit,

36:58.617 --> 37:01.251
and, like,
10 people show up.

37:01.253 --> 37:02.719
It's hilarious.

37:02.721 --> 37:06.356
Yeah, well, you know,
what's hilarious is, uh,

37:06.358 --> 37:09.626
you know, you look
like a-- a rapist...

37:11.295 --> 37:12.862
Like you've committed rape.

37:17.568 --> 37:19.569
You know
why ginnie dumped you?

37:19.571 --> 37:23.607
'Cause she's way
too fine for your
hella broke ass.

37:23.609 --> 37:25.742
I kind of want to punch you
in the face right now.

37:25.744 --> 37:28.511
You know, Marty,
a woman like ginnie,

37:28.513 --> 37:32.449
deserves to be given
the finer things
in life.

37:32.451 --> 37:35.785
And there's
a long line of dudes

37:35.787 --> 37:38.355
who want
to give it to her.

37:39.358 --> 37:40.557
Hey, Martin.

37:40.559 --> 37:42.259
Everything okay?
Yeah.

37:42.261 --> 37:46.296
I was just talking
to ginnie's, uh,
friend Trevor,

37:46.298 --> 37:48.865
just asking him
if he's seen ginnie.

37:48.867 --> 37:49.866
And?

37:49.868 --> 37:51.801
And I was
telling Marty here

37:51.803 --> 37:53.470
that the way
that girl's

37:53.472 --> 37:54.738
been working through
their breakup,

37:54.740 --> 37:56.873
she could be
facedown in any bed

37:56.875 --> 37:58.275
in a 10-mile rad--

38:08.286 --> 38:09.486
Look out!

38:17.028 --> 38:18.395
time to go.

38:30.375 --> 38:32.509
Holy shit.
You flattened
that guy out.

38:32.511 --> 38:33.543
I shouldn't have done that.

38:33.545 --> 38:34.577
Oh, fuck that guy.

38:34.579 --> 38:36.046
Never been
in a bar fight before.

38:36.048 --> 38:37.647
That was--
that was so amazing

38:37.649 --> 38:39.516
when I was like,
"look out!"

38:39.518 --> 38:41.351
You're a real lifesaver.
I mean--

38:41.353 --> 38:43.520
I feel like
i could have totally
held my own, though.

38:43.522 --> 38:44.954
I've got a ton
of pent-up rage

38:44.956 --> 38:47.457
I've never gotten to use.
Maybe we should go back.

38:47.459 --> 38:48.858
Gallo: Simmer down,
Mike Tyson.

38:53.531 --> 38:54.931
Oh, shit.
I know that girl.

38:56.000 --> 38:58.034
E'eryone is
right now--

38:58.036 --> 39:00.003
Megan?
Where are my keys?

39:00.005 --> 39:01.771
Megan, are--

39:01.773 --> 39:03.340
are you okay?

39:03.342 --> 39:06.076
Why is bri-baby being
such a dick-face right now?

39:06.078 --> 39:08.445
Um, i-- I don't know
who that is.

39:08.447 --> 39:11.081
Bri-baby.
Oh, I'm so outta here.

39:11.083 --> 39:13.083
And if he
doesn't like it,

39:13.085 --> 39:14.617
he can kiss my ass.

39:14.619 --> 39:16.086
Well, uh...

39:16.088 --> 39:17.620
Is this my car?

39:17.622 --> 39:18.888
Well, oh, oh, no.
This my car?

39:18.890 --> 39:20.690
I don't think
it's such a good idea

39:20.692 --> 39:22.659
for you to be driving
right now, Megan.

39:22.661 --> 39:25.362
Well, maybe it's not
such a good idea
for your face

39:25.364 --> 39:26.863
to be a dick
right now.

39:26.865 --> 39:28.598
Right. Okay.

39:28.600 --> 39:29.999
Uh...

39:31.570 --> 39:33.703
Mr. gallo...

39:33.705 --> 39:35.538
Yeah.

39:37.876 --> 39:39.609
Where do you live, Megan?

39:39.611 --> 39:41.511
You know where.

39:41.513 --> 39:43.480
Burger king.

39:43.482 --> 39:45.915
Because we're trying
to drive you home.

39:45.917 --> 39:47.984
Oh, I don't want
to go home.

39:47.986 --> 39:50.086
I want to go
to the par-tay.

39:50.088 --> 39:51.888
Are you
still on sweetzer?

39:51.890 --> 39:53.890
I want to go
to the party

39:53.892 --> 39:56.526
so I can blow
Dan Franklin.

39:56.528 --> 39:58.762
Let's get her home,
for Dan Franklin's
sake.

39:58.764 --> 39:59.963
Yeah, I think
she's still on sweetzer.

39:59.965 --> 40:01.431
It's just a right
at the next light.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.901
Yeah?

40:04.903 --> 40:07.837
Okay, slow down,
Barry.

40:07.839 --> 40:11.107
What the hell
do you mean they're
backing out? They--

40:11.109 --> 40:13.943
Barry. Barry.

40:13.945 --> 40:14.978
Barry.

40:14.980 --> 40:16.413
Fuck.

40:17.548 --> 40:18.915
Fucking phone died.

40:18.917 --> 40:19.983
Perfect.

40:19.985 --> 40:21.851
Take a picture,
and post it

40:21.853 --> 40:23.820
on bri-baby's
Twitter fuck.

40:34.732 --> 40:36.166
you gonna make it
upstairs okay?

40:36.168 --> 40:37.734
Where is it?

40:37.736 --> 40:39.569
Where it's at?

40:39.571 --> 40:40.937
We'll--
we'll help you up.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.005
Got it.

40:43.207 --> 40:45.708
Why don't you
get rid of Martin

40:45.710 --> 40:49.679
so me and you can go
to the party and party?

40:49.681 --> 40:51.648
I think you're
kind of partied out, kiddo.

40:51.650 --> 40:54.150
Ah, I'm fine.
I had, like, two shots.

40:54.152 --> 40:56.085
I'm fuckin' fine.

40:56.087 --> 40:57.754
I just need to spit.

41:04.028 --> 41:05.929
Megan:
Where are you taking me?

41:05.931 --> 41:08.498
Okay. All right.

41:08.500 --> 41:10.033
There you go.

41:10.035 --> 41:11.568
Where am I?

41:11.570 --> 41:13.670
Move just a little bit.

41:13.672 --> 41:15.138
Okay.

41:16.474 --> 41:18.541
Drink this.
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

41:18.543 --> 41:19.909
Megan...
Uh-uh. Uh-uh...

41:19.911 --> 41:21.611
Drink this. It's gonna
make you feel better.

41:21.613 --> 41:22.812
Mm. I'm not thirsty.

41:22.814 --> 41:24.247
It'll make you
feel better, Megan.

41:24.249 --> 41:25.515
Uh-uh.
Drink it.

41:40.899 --> 41:42.799
We can make out
if you want.

41:42.801 --> 41:44.501
That's a nice offer,

41:44.503 --> 41:46.769
but I'm good.

41:46.771 --> 41:51.708
Mm, 'cause
you're so in love
with ginnie still.

41:51.710 --> 41:53.176
Well, sure, that,
and I think

41:53.178 --> 41:55.512
you still have
some vomit in your hair.

42:16.934 --> 42:19.903
That's fucked up, dude.

42:19.905 --> 42:23.640
'Cause you know
she's in love
with someone else.

42:23.642 --> 42:25.542
She is?

42:25.544 --> 42:26.910
Mm-hmm.

42:26.912 --> 42:28.645
Who's that?

42:28.647 --> 42:31.781
Mr. hot stuff.

42:31.783 --> 42:33.650
Mm.

42:33.652 --> 42:34.684
Mr. hot stuff?

42:34.686 --> 42:37.320
Dude's ripped.

42:37.322 --> 42:39.122
That's...

42:39.124 --> 42:40.323
Awesome.

42:41.692 --> 42:43.326
This Mr. hot stuff...

42:44.695 --> 42:46.296
Does he have a name?

42:48.266 --> 42:49.265
Megan?

42:49.267 --> 42:51.734
Megan, what's his name?

42:52.703 --> 42:54.037
M-Megan.

42:54.039 --> 42:56.673
Megan. Megan.

43:02.346 --> 43:05.715
This girl is friends
with my daughter?

43:05.717 --> 43:07.617
Yeah.

43:07.619 --> 43:09.752
This isn't ginnie,
Mr. gallo.

43:09.754 --> 43:11.721
She's not like this.

43:14.191 --> 43:16.259
Let me find you
a shirt.

43:19.196 --> 43:22.966
What the fuck
is going on here?

43:22.968 --> 43:24.734
Hey, uh, no.

43:24.736 --> 43:26.302
Now, um...

43:28.173 --> 43:30.306
What the fuck
is going on here?

43:30.308 --> 43:32.875
Hey, relax, okay?
We gave the girl a ride.
That's all.

43:32.877 --> 43:35.111
That's my fucking
girlfriend, dude!

43:35.113 --> 43:37.880
Oh, you're, um,
bri-baby.

43:37.882 --> 43:39.215
I-I'm Martin.

43:39.217 --> 43:40.350
I'm Martin.

43:40.352 --> 43:41.951
I'm ginnie's
ex-boyfriend,

43:41.953 --> 43:43.086
Megan's friend
ginnie.

43:43.088 --> 43:44.854
Why is this dude
fucking shirtless?

43:45.823 --> 43:48.191
Just relax, bri-baby.

43:48.193 --> 43:50.960
Your girlfriend
threw up on me is all.

43:53.664 --> 43:55.198
Tell you what.
We'll just, uh,

43:55.200 --> 43:57.834
give you a few dollars
for the shirt,

43:57.836 --> 43:59.969
and, uh, we'll just--

44:01.905 --> 44:03.306
hey, Martin--

44:13.851 --> 44:15.051
Fuck.

44:16.286 --> 44:17.320
Come on.

44:17.322 --> 44:19.722
Come on.

44:19.724 --> 44:20.957
Come on.

44:22.226 --> 44:23.793
Martin: Hey!

44:33.203 --> 44:35.772
I think he's--

44:35.774 --> 44:37.774
he's...

44:38.909 --> 44:40.276
Oh, he's breathing.

44:40.278 --> 44:41.344
He's breathing.

44:41.346 --> 44:42.945
Good for him.

44:43.981 --> 44:45.815
Let's get
out of here.

44:45.817 --> 44:46.883
That-a-way.

44:59.897 --> 45:01.898
That doesn't
look too bad.

45:01.900 --> 45:03.700
Fucking hurts.

45:04.468 --> 45:05.935
How 'bout the smell?

45:05.937 --> 45:07.470
I still smell
like vomit?

45:07.472 --> 45:09.272
Little bit.

45:09.274 --> 45:10.773
Oh.

45:17.314 --> 45:19.215
What?
Thanks.

45:20.217 --> 45:22.185
You really had
my back up there.

45:22.187 --> 45:24.754
Yeah, well, Mr. gallo--

45:24.756 --> 45:26.155
you can call me frank.

45:26.157 --> 45:28.925
I don't think
i can do that, Mr. gallo,

45:28.927 --> 45:30.960
but you're welcome.

45:36.500 --> 45:38.968
Megan said ginnie
had a new boyfriend.

45:38.970 --> 45:41.437
Yeah.
Mr. hot stuff.

45:41.439 --> 45:44.340
Bartender at the club
said the same thing.

45:45.909 --> 45:49.412
Well, so...

45:49.414 --> 45:52.215
We probably won't
be finding her tonight,

45:52.217 --> 45:55.885
and that's because
she's with him.

45:55.887 --> 45:57.754
Look, Martin--

45:57.756 --> 46:01.290
so even if we do
find her, find them,
how's it gonna look?

46:01.292 --> 46:03.025
I'm tooling around
with her dad.

46:03.027 --> 46:04.861
She's shacked up
with her new boyfriend.

46:04.863 --> 46:07.263
So she's
dating someone else.
So what?

46:07.265 --> 46:10.166
I mean, don't you
still want to know
that she's okay?

46:10.168 --> 46:11.801
Aren't you
at all worried that
none of the people

46:11.803 --> 46:13.069
we talked to
tonight know
where she is?

46:13.071 --> 46:14.337
Of course
I'm worried about her.

46:14.339 --> 46:15.772
Because I thought you
still cared about her.

46:15.774 --> 46:16.873
Of course I still
care about her!

46:16.875 --> 46:18.341
She broke my heart!

46:18.343 --> 46:21.110
Has that not
been spelled out enough
for you tonight?

46:21.112 --> 46:23.813
Your daughter
fucked my shit up.

46:23.815 --> 46:26.916
My life has been
a complete wreck
for the last three months.

46:26.918 --> 46:30.319
I mean, I can't eat.
I can't think straight.
I can't play music.

46:30.321 --> 46:32.889
All I've literally
been able to do...

46:32.891 --> 46:34.223
Is sleep.

46:41.832 --> 46:43.533
So what do you
want to do, go home?

46:43.535 --> 46:46.035
Yes.

46:46.037 --> 46:47.804
Crawl into bed,
sleep some more?

46:47.806 --> 46:51.174
Yes, that's exactly
what I wanna do.

46:53.243 --> 46:55.945
Martin, I get it.
I do, but...

46:55.947 --> 46:59.382
It's a fucking
terrible feeling.

47:00.350 --> 47:02.084
It sucks, but...

47:02.086 --> 47:03.986
I don't think retreating
into your shell

47:03.988 --> 47:05.888
is doing you
a lot of good.

47:05.890 --> 47:10.026
Listen, I'm telling you
this from personal
experience, okay?

47:10.028 --> 47:12.094
Life goes by
really fast.

47:13.263 --> 47:15.965
If you half-ass it now,

47:15.967 --> 47:17.466
you're gonna
feel it later.

47:27.945 --> 47:29.078
Yeah.

47:30.347 --> 47:31.614
Okay.

47:34.985 --> 47:37.019
Okay. Where to now?

47:39.122 --> 47:41.858
There you go, juicy.

47:46.396 --> 47:50.099
Since we're, um,
exploring our options--

47:50.101 --> 47:52.635
and I know this is
a sensitive area,

47:52.637 --> 47:55.238
but maybe you
could try calling
ginnie's mom.

47:55.240 --> 47:56.873
I'm not calling
ginnie's mother, period.

47:56.875 --> 47:59.108
End of story. End of story.
Okay, but I was thinking--

47:59.110 --> 48:01.310
all right.

48:02.412 --> 48:04.380
So why'd you
and ginnie break up?

48:05.482 --> 48:06.983
You know that
prizewinning douchebag

48:06.985 --> 48:08.451
Trevor back at the club,

48:08.453 --> 48:11.520
he was saying
that ginnie is
out of my league.

48:13.457 --> 48:18.160
She's an amazing girl,
as you obviously know.

48:18.162 --> 48:21.597
She's smart,
beautiful, funny,

48:21.599 --> 48:23.499
and tough.

48:23.501 --> 48:25.167
Yeah, and, um...

48:27.170 --> 48:29.238
She is out of my league.

48:30.207 --> 48:32.108
Well...

48:32.110 --> 48:34.477
Maybe she saw
something you don't.

48:35.412 --> 48:36.646
Maybe she did,

48:36.648 --> 48:39.382
but I started to get
insecure about it,

48:39.384 --> 48:42.184
and then I got jealous
and moody.

48:42.186 --> 48:43.920
I don't know.

48:43.922 --> 48:46.222
It was my fault.

48:46.224 --> 48:48.324
I just--

48:48.326 --> 48:51.327
I fucked it up.

48:51.329 --> 48:53.529
I fucked it all up.

48:55.699 --> 48:57.967
We all fuck it up
sometimes.

49:05.143 --> 49:07.009
There it is.

49:15.520 --> 49:18.421
So procurement,

49:18.423 --> 49:19.422
what is that?

49:19.424 --> 49:20.489
Forget about it.

49:20.491 --> 49:23.225
No, no.
I'm curious, really.

49:23.227 --> 49:25.561
I bid on contracts
from foreign governments

49:25.563 --> 49:28.597
to procure for them
anything they need in bulk,

49:28.599 --> 49:31.133
grain, seed,
fertilizer,

49:31.135 --> 49:33.402
fucking nuts and bolts,
what have you.

49:33.404 --> 49:34.570
Ah.

49:34.572 --> 49:35.705
Okay.

49:35.707 --> 49:37.306
Procurement.

49:37.308 --> 49:41.978
Actually, figuring
how to get 20 tons
of corn feed

49:41.980 --> 49:46.382
from Germany to Nigeria
can be more exciting
than it might sound like.

49:46.384 --> 49:49.986
But it's also...

49:51.288 --> 49:54.390
Just not
a normal lifestyle,
you know?

49:54.392 --> 49:58.627
Makes it harder
to see my daughter,

49:58.629 --> 50:01.030
for example.

50:05.770 --> 50:09.071
hey, you know
that other girl at the club?

50:10.107 --> 50:11.140
What girl?

50:11.142 --> 50:12.508
What do you mean,
"what girl?"

50:12.510 --> 50:14.410
The one I saw you talking to.
She's into you.

50:14.412 --> 50:15.778
What, Lois?

50:15.780 --> 50:17.780
Wait. How--
how did you even--

50:17.782 --> 50:18.781
you weren't
even there.

50:18.783 --> 50:20.182
Jesus, Martin, wake up.

50:20.184 --> 50:22.385
90% of that shit
is body language, okay?

50:22.387 --> 50:23.652
She's into you.

50:23.654 --> 50:25.388
Wow, really?

50:25.390 --> 50:26.455
Huh, Lois.

50:26.457 --> 50:28.457
I just...

50:30.627 --> 50:32.428
You gotta
be kidding me.

50:34.164 --> 50:35.398
Gary?

50:37.100 --> 50:38.300
Hey!

50:38.302 --> 50:40.603
Hey, how's it
going, guys?

50:40.605 --> 50:42.104
Hey, did you
find ginnie?

50:42.106 --> 50:43.406
Was she
at the cafe?

50:43.408 --> 50:45.808
No.
Aw, bummer. Bummer.

50:45.810 --> 50:47.676
You don't think
she got kidnapped,
do you?

50:47.678 --> 50:49.612
No! Jesus, Gary!

50:51.282 --> 50:52.515
Hey, does Roberta
know you're here?

50:52.517 --> 50:54.316
Yeah. Yeah, no.

50:54.318 --> 50:55.818
She sent me out
for groceries.

50:55.820 --> 50:59.522
Um, I had to replace
the cheese.

50:59.524 --> 51:01.590
Yeah, so how's that going,
the grocery shopping?

51:01.592 --> 51:04.427
I don't know.
I think I just,
um, needed...

51:04.429 --> 51:05.728
Air.

51:05.730 --> 51:08.664
Yeah, 'cause
actually, uh...

51:08.666 --> 51:11.500
I don't know
if you guys noticed,

51:11.502 --> 51:13.536
but Roberta and i
have actually

51:13.538 --> 51:15.638
been having a lot
of problems lately.

51:15.640 --> 51:17.073
No shit? Really?

51:17.075 --> 51:18.641
No idea.
Apparently,

51:18.643 --> 51:21.844
the sight of my face
nauseates her

51:21.846 --> 51:24.513
is what she told me
verbatim.
Mm.

51:24.515 --> 51:26.248
Sorry to hear that, gare.

51:26.250 --> 51:27.516
Thanks.

51:27.518 --> 51:30.186
Uh, how 'bout if i
buy you another one?

51:30.188 --> 51:32.321
Yeah! Yeah, man!
Now we're talking!

51:32.323 --> 51:33.322
Definitely!

51:33.324 --> 51:34.457
Yeah, one more
for our friend.

51:34.459 --> 51:36.092
One more.
Yeah, on him. He's--

51:36.094 --> 51:37.526
I got it.
On him, yeah.

51:37.528 --> 51:40.229
Bartender: All right.
Mm.

51:40.231 --> 51:42.498
Always tastes better
when it's free. Heh.

51:42.500 --> 51:43.833
It does, though,
a little bit.

51:43.835 --> 51:45.334
Yeah, no,
i remember those days.

51:45.336 --> 51:46.335
Yeah, yeah, yeah. God.

51:46.337 --> 51:48.137
Okay, back to business.

51:48.139 --> 51:50.439
What do we know
about this guy, Mr. hot stuff?

51:50.441 --> 51:51.540
Mr. who?

51:51.542 --> 51:53.142
Ginnie's got
a new boyfriend.

51:53.144 --> 51:54.310
Really?
Damn it.

51:55.278 --> 51:57.113
For you, man.
Damn it.

51:57.115 --> 51:58.614
That sucks
for you.

52:01.151 --> 52:03.285
We know he's
a regular at the club.

52:03.287 --> 52:05.821
Bartender says
he's a big tipper.

52:05.823 --> 52:07.790
And he's ripped,
apparently.

52:07.792 --> 52:10.493
So he goes to the gym,
frequents nightclubs,

52:10.495 --> 52:12.361
likes to throw
his money around,

52:12.363 --> 52:14.530
maybe act like a big shot.

52:14.532 --> 52:16.165
Sounds like
an asshole.

52:16.167 --> 52:18.200
This is what I'm saying.
I smell a rat here.

52:18.202 --> 52:19.802
Hmm. What about
with Martin?

52:19.804 --> 52:21.570
Did you smell a rat
when you met him?

52:21.572 --> 52:23.205
No, no rat.

52:23.207 --> 52:25.274
Field mouse, maybe.

52:25.276 --> 52:26.742
Field mouse.

52:26.744 --> 52:27.743
Hah hah.

52:27.745 --> 52:28.777
He's right.

52:28.779 --> 52:30.846
You're
a field mouse, bro.

52:32.683 --> 52:33.849
This is great.

52:33.851 --> 52:35.651
This is what
I'm talking about.

52:35.653 --> 52:38.254
This is just guys
being guys,

52:38.256 --> 52:40.556
drinking beer,
and busting balls.

52:40.558 --> 52:42.424
"Field mouse."

52:42.426 --> 52:43.826
Mm. Mm-mmm.

52:43.828 --> 52:46.328
Next round is on me.
I insist.

52:46.330 --> 52:48.597
You've been
more than generous,
Mr. gallo.

52:48.599 --> 52:52.701
Got an emergency 20
in here somewhere.

52:52.703 --> 52:55.204
No way.

52:55.206 --> 52:56.405
Ohh.

52:56.407 --> 52:58.407
I been looking
for this,

52:58.409 --> 53:00.409
my 'shrooms.

53:00.411 --> 53:03.279
You guys want some?
Huh?

53:03.281 --> 53:05.214
Hey, we should
do these together,

53:05.216 --> 53:07.283
go camping.
Joshua tree.

53:07.285 --> 53:09.818
You should probably
put those away, like, now.

53:11.955 --> 53:13.289
Wait.

53:13.291 --> 53:14.890
Japanese paper.

53:17.961 --> 53:19.929
Gary: Hey, man.

53:25.937 --> 53:28.571
Gary,
you dumbass, drug-addled
son of a bitch,

53:28.573 --> 53:29.738
I could kiss you
right now.

53:29.740 --> 53:30.940
Okay, but we
should wait

53:30.942 --> 53:32.441
'til after we
eat the 'shrooms.

53:32.443 --> 53:33.742
Are you kidding me?

53:33.744 --> 53:35.611
Are you just
completely out to lunch?

53:35.613 --> 53:37.646
Martin, who cares?

53:37.648 --> 53:39.748
We have
ginnie's address.
Come on. Let's go.

53:39.750 --> 53:42.618
No, no, no, no.
We've been searching
for ginnie all day and night

53:42.620 --> 53:44.253
all over town
while her address

53:44.255 --> 53:45.854
has been sitting
in his pocket,

53:45.856 --> 53:47.656
wrapping
his stupid 'shrooms!

53:47.658 --> 53:49.692
Martin, man,
i-I'm really sorry.

53:49.694 --> 53:51.293
I am,
but you just--

53:51.295 --> 53:52.294
Martin,
come on.

53:52.296 --> 53:53.862
Let it go.

53:55.498 --> 53:56.899
Field mouse, huh?

54:01.438 --> 54:02.938
Hey, guys, wait.

54:03.974 --> 54:06.475
Can I come?

54:08.445 --> 54:10.613
Gary: Whoo-hoo!

54:11.849 --> 54:13.249
This is great, really.

54:13.251 --> 54:14.817
Really great, man.

54:14.819 --> 54:16.552
Call to adventure,
you know?

54:16.554 --> 54:17.886
We're on the case.

54:17.888 --> 54:19.822
Oh, you know what it's--
it's, um--

54:19.824 --> 54:22.524
it's like that movie,
that movie...

54:22.526 --> 54:23.659
John Wayne--

54:24.762 --> 54:26.462
Whoa!

54:27.797 --> 54:29.665
Whuhh!

54:29.667 --> 54:32.735
Mr. gallo, you sure
you're okay to drive?

54:32.737 --> 54:34.670
Sound like my ex.
"The searchers."

54:34.672 --> 54:35.971
"The searchers."
That's it.

54:35.973 --> 54:37.973
Ah, man,
that's an awesome movie.

54:37.975 --> 54:41.343
Hey, do either of you
have any weed on you?

54:41.345 --> 54:43.679
I don't like to 'shroom
without a little weed.

54:43.681 --> 54:46.949
You know, I bet
i can get my dealer
to come meet us.

54:46.951 --> 54:48.384
What's the, um--
Gary...

54:48.386 --> 54:49.918
We're not gonna have
your weed dealer

54:49.920 --> 54:51.387
meet us at
my daughter's place.

54:51.389 --> 54:53.555
Right. No, right.
Right. Um...

54:53.557 --> 54:54.957
Oh, shit.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.692
Sycamore, right?

54:56.694 --> 54:57.860
What's the address?

54:57.862 --> 54:59.028
1030 sycamore.

54:59.030 --> 55:01.730
Terri sadler.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.632
That's her roommate,
right?

55:03.634 --> 55:05.000
Yeah, that's her.
She's the--

55:05.002 --> 55:07.069
the jittery girl.
You know her, right?

55:07.071 --> 55:08.570
No, but keep asking.

55:10.740 --> 55:12.074
Ohh!

55:12.076 --> 55:14.376
I'm coming.

55:14.378 --> 55:15.511
I'm coming.

55:15.513 --> 55:17.513
I can't
get unbuckled.

55:17.515 --> 55:19.048
Gary, just stay
with the car.

55:19.050 --> 55:20.683
Mm-hmm.

55:21.785 --> 55:23.452
Windows are dark.

55:23.454 --> 55:24.620
Yeah, well, some people

55:24.622 --> 55:26.855
are actually asleep
after midnight.

55:43.474 --> 55:44.907
Okay. When you and ginnie
lived together,

55:44.909 --> 55:46.575
where did you hide
the spare key?

55:46.577 --> 55:48.110
Where?

55:48.112 --> 55:51.380
Um, that's not
really, um--

55:51.382 --> 55:53.048
that's
kind of private.

55:53.050 --> 55:54.516
Martin, I'm not
gonna rob you.

55:54.518 --> 55:55.884
What am I gonna take,
your bong?

55:55.886 --> 55:58.754
Where did you
hide the key?

55:58.756 --> 56:01.090
It was under a rock,
but...

56:05.061 --> 56:06.929
What--
what are you gonna--

56:06.931 --> 56:08.664
no, you're not gonna--
it's okay.

56:08.666 --> 56:09.798
I'm her father.

56:13.970 --> 56:16.538
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Mr. gallo, you are not--

56:16.540 --> 56:18.707
Martin, I need to see
if my daughter is in trouble.

56:18.709 --> 56:22.478
Okay, this is
a very bad idea.

56:22.480 --> 56:24.947
You know what, Martin?
I'm starting to see why
ginnie kicked you to the curb.

56:24.949 --> 56:26.982
Oh, are you? And why's that?
Yeah.

56:26.984 --> 56:28.584
'Cause you're
a namby-pamby,

56:28.586 --> 56:29.818
little fucking
pain in the ass.

56:29.820 --> 56:30.853
Now move it.

56:30.855 --> 56:33.422
No.

56:33.424 --> 56:34.690
Seriously?

56:34.692 --> 56:36.592
Martin, you do not
want to be standing

56:36.594 --> 56:37.960
in my fucking way
right now.

56:43.500 --> 56:44.767
Fine.

56:44.769 --> 56:46.802
That's what I thought.

56:46.804 --> 56:47.870
Fuck this.

56:56.013 --> 56:57.913
Shit.

56:57.915 --> 56:59.982
Gary: Because it's--
it's frustrating,

56:59.984 --> 57:02.050
'cause you
don't trust me
like I trust you!

57:02.052 --> 57:03.552
Because all
you wanna do

57:03.554 --> 57:05.854
is sit around watching
"game of thrones"

57:05.856 --> 57:07.156
and fantasize
about Jaime lannister!

57:07.158 --> 57:09.191
You do! You want
to bang the shit

57:09.193 --> 57:10.692
out of Jaime lannister!
That's fine!

57:10.694 --> 57:13.061
I don't get mad at you,
because I get it!

57:13.063 --> 57:14.730
Even with one hand,
he's beautiful!

57:18.601 --> 57:20.102
Hello.

57:24.207 --> 57:26.508
Anybody home?

57:29.212 --> 57:30.712
Shit.

57:47.831 --> 57:49.498
Woman:
Hello.

58:17.961 --> 58:19.595
Mr. gallo.

58:25.568 --> 58:27.169
I think ginnie's room's
over here.

58:27.171 --> 58:28.737
Thank fucking god.

58:28.739 --> 58:30.839
What the fuck?

58:30.841 --> 58:32.541
Wait. Hold on.

58:33.810 --> 58:35.577
I found out
where ginnie is.

58:35.579 --> 58:37.613
Where?
She went on vacation

58:37.615 --> 58:39.615
with her new boyfriend.

58:40.750 --> 58:42.184
His name is kip.

58:42.186 --> 58:43.886
Kip.
Yeah.

58:43.888 --> 58:45.621
I think it sounds
pretty serious.

58:45.623 --> 58:47.122
Gary: And guess what, babe.

58:47.124 --> 58:48.557
'Member those 'shrooms

58:48.559 --> 58:50.259
you wouldn't let me
take on Halloween?

58:50.261 --> 58:51.727
Well, trick or treat,

58:51.729 --> 58:53.562
'cause I'm taking 'em
right now.

58:54.932 --> 58:58.033
Mmm. Delicious.

58:58.035 --> 59:01.003
I can eat 'shrooms.
I can eat sun chips.

59:01.005 --> 59:04.606
I can eat fucking cheese,
because I'm my own man.

59:04.608 --> 59:06.208
I have something
inside of me.

59:06.210 --> 59:07.843
I have potential.

59:07.845 --> 59:09.878
I-- hello. Hel--

59:09.880 --> 59:12.247
all right, it's Gary.
Call me back.

59:39.343 --> 59:40.676
wait a minute.
How do you know

59:40.678 --> 59:41.944
where she is?
Don't get mad.

59:41.946 --> 59:43.045
Terri: Hello?
Is someone there?

59:43.047 --> 59:44.046
Hello?

59:47.051 --> 59:48.183
Shh.
Uh...

59:48.185 --> 59:49.184
Hi...

59:49.186 --> 59:51.153
There. This is--

59:51.155 --> 59:53.255
No, no, no. It's...

59:53.257 --> 59:54.256
What is
this girl's name?

59:54.258 --> 59:55.657
Um, Tammy, Toni, uh...

59:59.729 --> 01:00:01.063
Oh, Jesus Christ.

01:00:01.065 --> 01:00:02.731
Frank: Hey, it's okay.
It's okay. You know him.

01:00:02.733 --> 01:00:05.067
Run!

01:00:06.270 --> 01:00:08.637
I will fucking
murder you!

01:00:08.639 --> 01:00:10.105
You don't know her?
No.

01:00:10.107 --> 01:00:12.608
I don't fucking know her.

01:00:12.610 --> 01:00:14.009
Terri: I will
fucking kill you!

01:00:14.011 --> 01:00:17.012
Do you hear that,
you motherfucker?!

01:00:17.014 --> 01:00:18.714
I have a gun!

01:00:18.716 --> 01:00:21.116
You motherfucker,
i will...

01:00:21.118 --> 01:00:22.217
What do we do?

01:00:25.722 --> 01:00:26.989
No way.

01:00:26.991 --> 01:00:29.791
No way.
Come on.

01:00:29.793 --> 01:00:33.095
...fucking calling
the motherfucking cops
on you!

01:00:33.097 --> 01:00:35.330
I am not getting
arrested tonight.

01:00:38.301 --> 01:00:39.735
Wait. Oh.

01:01:25.149 --> 01:01:28.684
So beautiful.

01:01:42.733 --> 01:01:44.800
I know how you found out
ginnie's on vacation.

01:01:44.802 --> 01:01:46.334
You called her mom.
Yeah, that's right.

01:01:46.336 --> 01:01:48.970
I did. I called
Connie, who actually
talks to ginnie

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:50.405
and cares about what's
going on in her life

01:01:50.407 --> 01:01:52.741
and knows where
the hell she is.

01:01:52.743 --> 01:01:55.377
You had no right to do that.
I told you I didn't
want to worry her.

01:01:55.379 --> 01:01:56.712
Are you serious?
Yeah.

01:01:56.714 --> 01:01:58.246
We should have called
12 hours ago.

01:01:58.248 --> 01:02:00.315
Like, then,
maybe you wouldn't
have home invaded.

01:02:00.317 --> 01:02:01.883
It's complicated,
okay?

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:03.752
I didn't do right

01:02:03.754 --> 01:02:04.920
by ginnie's mom. I...

01:02:04.922 --> 01:02:06.822
Fucked around
when ginnie was little.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.491
Yeah, it's old news.
I've heard all about it,
believe me.

01:02:09.493 --> 01:02:12.194
You got a lot of nerve
talking to me like that.

01:02:12.196 --> 01:02:14.129
Ginnie's mom is fine,
Mr. gallo.

01:02:14.131 --> 01:02:16.865
She's happily remarried.
She got over it years ago.

01:02:16.867 --> 01:02:18.166
Ginnie did, too.

01:02:18.168 --> 01:02:19.434
Freeze! Stop right there!

01:02:35.017 --> 01:02:36.451
I'm gonna let it shine.

01:02:36.453 --> 01:02:38.053
I'm gonna let it shine.

01:02:38.055 --> 01:02:40.088
I'm gonna
let it shine.

01:02:40.090 --> 01:02:42.424
I'm shining my light!

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.764
This is the police.
Don't move.

01:02:48.766 --> 01:02:51.967
Just to be clear,
I've always been there
for my daughter.

01:02:51.969 --> 01:02:53.835
I gave her
everything she wanted.

01:02:53.837 --> 01:02:55.003
How 'bout
your attention?

01:02:56.073 --> 01:02:57.205
Oh, sh...
Fuck.

01:02:59.877 --> 01:03:01.109
Hi.

01:03:01.111 --> 01:03:02.978
We, uh-- could we
use your bathroom?

01:03:02.980 --> 01:03:05.447
Toilet is
for customers only.

01:03:05.449 --> 01:03:07.783
Uh, here.

01:03:11.121 --> 01:03:12.888
Come on.

01:03:12.890 --> 01:03:14.156
Are you fucking
kidding me?

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:21.196
Sorry. Look,
uh, my fault.

01:03:21.198 --> 01:03:22.931
Here you go.
Thank you. Come on.

01:03:22.933 --> 01:03:24.966
Let's go.

01:03:52.929 --> 01:03:54.396
Both of you,
on the ground now!

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:01.002
This day is never-ending.
What is this?

01:04:01.004 --> 01:04:03.004
I'm sure
it's nothing, babe.

01:04:03.006 --> 01:04:04.573
It's fine.

01:04:04.575 --> 01:04:08.476
No, kip,
they're directly
in front of my house.

01:04:08.478 --> 01:04:11.012
Okay, look, officers,

01:04:11.014 --> 01:04:13.882
it's-- it's just really
a big misunderstanding.

01:04:13.884 --> 01:04:16.051
Stop right there,
and get down!

01:04:16.053 --> 01:04:17.452
Just calm down
for a second.

01:04:17.454 --> 01:04:18.920
I can explain
the whole thing.

01:04:18.922 --> 01:04:20.121
That was
my daughter's
apartment.

01:04:20.123 --> 01:04:21.122
On the ground!

01:04:21.124 --> 01:04:24.025
Mr. gallo, get down now.

01:04:24.027 --> 01:04:26.328
I will not.
I am an upstanding
citizen.

01:04:26.330 --> 01:04:28.063
I am a taxpayer.

01:04:28.065 --> 01:04:29.097
I am a--
dad?

01:04:29.099 --> 01:04:31.066
Ginnie?
Ginnie?

01:05:03.433 --> 01:05:05.133
Gary, stop.

01:05:08.104 --> 01:05:10.272
Tastes like glass.

01:05:25.187 --> 01:05:27.322
All I wanted
was to make it

01:05:27.324 --> 01:05:29.958
through this breakup
in one piece,

01:05:29.960 --> 01:05:34.129
not be desperate
or stalkery
or pathetic.

01:05:35.298 --> 01:05:37.699
I just needed
to wait it out,

01:05:37.701 --> 01:05:40.502
get to the other side
with my pride intact.

01:05:48.145 --> 01:05:54.015
instead, I became
my ex-girlfriend's
father's idiot lackey,

01:05:54.017 --> 01:05:55.317
everyone she
knows in this town

01:05:55.319 --> 01:05:58.086
getting an eyeful
of what a loser I am.

01:05:58.088 --> 01:05:59.621
Ah, Martin,
you're not a loser.

01:05:59.623 --> 01:06:01.556
Oh, not to mention--
not to mention

01:06:01.558 --> 01:06:03.658
the throwing up,
the bar brawl,

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:07.963
breaking and entering
my ex-girlfriend's
new home,

01:06:07.965 --> 01:06:09.464
running
from the police--

01:06:09.466 --> 01:06:11.366
I really don't need
a recap, okay?

01:06:11.368 --> 01:06:12.367
I was there.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:26.448
Gary, Gary, Gary,
Gary, just shut
the fuck up, okay?!

01:06:26.450 --> 01:06:28.383
Just shut
the fuck up!

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:43.164
Couple of weeks ago
in my hotel in Mumbai,

01:06:43.166 --> 01:06:46.601
I woke up
in the middle
of the night

01:06:46.603 --> 01:06:48.169
soaked in sweat,

01:06:48.171 --> 01:06:50.438
didn't know
where I was.

01:06:52.041 --> 01:06:54.242
I didn't know
who I was for a second.

01:06:56.145 --> 01:06:58.780
My heart was just going...

01:06:58.782 --> 01:07:00.348
Thousand miles a minute.

01:07:03.519 --> 01:07:06.388
I mean, i-- I thought
i was gonna die.

01:07:06.390 --> 01:07:07.756
I called down
to the front desk

01:07:07.758 --> 01:07:10.792
and-- and asked 'em
to send up a doctor.

01:07:13.729 --> 01:07:16.698
And then I'm--
I'm just lying there,

01:07:16.700 --> 01:07:18.633
thinking, "this is it,"

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:22.270
you know, "this is--
this is it."

01:07:23.239 --> 01:07:25.306
And so I called ginnie...

01:07:28.144 --> 01:07:29.644
And ginnie wasn't there.

01:07:32.148 --> 01:07:34.682
And of course
the doctor shows up,

01:07:34.684 --> 01:07:36.718
and he-- and he
checks everything out.

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.153
He says it's
not a heart attack.

01:07:38.155 --> 01:07:39.487
It's not-- it's nothing.

01:07:39.489 --> 01:07:43.758
It's a fucking
panic attack.

01:07:43.760 --> 01:07:47.262
Just ridiculous...

01:07:47.264 --> 01:07:49.564
Embarrassing.

01:07:51.834 --> 01:07:54.135
I'm at the airport
the next morning,

01:07:54.137 --> 01:07:55.203
and, uh...

01:07:57.206 --> 01:07:59.774
No, it's not like
there's a layover here.

01:07:59.776 --> 01:08:02.577
I'm supposed to be
in Geneva right now.

01:08:05.081 --> 01:08:07.282
But I came here,
because...

01:08:10.086 --> 01:08:12.720
Because I needed to see
my little girl.

01:08:17.593 --> 01:08:19.661
I have no one else, Martin.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:23.832
You know?

01:08:26.669 --> 01:08:28.203
She's all I got.

01:08:33.642 --> 01:08:35.676
Hey, you guys,
you guys,

01:08:35.679 --> 01:08:38.179
you guys,
you guys...

01:08:39.281 --> 01:08:42.550
Can we just be serious
for one moment?

01:08:42.551 --> 01:08:44.752
Okay, can we just...

01:08:44.754 --> 01:08:48.857
Talk real shit?

01:09:02.839 --> 01:09:05.540
Visitor for Gary...

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:06.674
"Fulenwilder"?

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:08.309
Huh? I'm Gary.

01:09:10.179 --> 01:09:11.312
Roberta.

01:09:12.413 --> 01:09:13.548
Oh, my god.

01:09:13.550 --> 01:09:16.518
Oh, my poor, poor baby.
Oh, yeah.

01:09:16.520 --> 01:09:18.620
What a night
you've had.

01:09:18.622 --> 01:09:21.756
Baby, I see your light.

01:09:21.758 --> 01:09:24.392
It's, like, blue.

01:09:24.394 --> 01:09:27.194
Your aura is blue,

01:09:27.197 --> 01:09:29.397
like an "avatar" thing.
Ho ho.

01:09:30.466 --> 01:09:31.466
You know,

01:09:31.468 --> 01:09:32.734
I actually
believed you,

01:09:32.736 --> 01:09:34.636
that you were
going to the store

01:09:34.638 --> 01:09:35.670
to replace
the cheese

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:37.505
because you
felt bad about it.

01:09:37.506 --> 01:09:38.573
No, no, no.

01:09:38.575 --> 01:09:40.308
Not my gare.

01:09:40.310 --> 01:09:42.377
My gare's
not that kind of
boyfriend, is he?

01:09:42.379 --> 01:09:43.645
Ow. Ow. Ow...
He's more
of a call you

01:09:43.647 --> 01:09:45.279
from jail
at 4:00 A.M.

01:09:45.282 --> 01:09:46.747
Because I'm
tripping my balls off
kind of guy.

01:09:46.750 --> 01:09:48.483
Ow. Uh, honey,
your aura's

01:09:48.484 --> 01:09:50.551
turning, like,
dark red now.

01:09:50.554 --> 01:09:52.754
Good. Here's the drill.

01:09:52.756 --> 01:09:55.256
You're gonna
stay here until
your arraignment...

01:09:55.258 --> 01:09:56.691
Uh-huh.
Which is in two days,

01:09:56.693 --> 01:09:58.426
and you're
gonna sit and think

01:09:58.428 --> 01:10:00.461
about whether
you want to come home

01:10:00.463 --> 01:10:03.665
or be your own man
and let your light
shine down.

01:10:03.667 --> 01:10:05.800
I want--
i want to come home.
I want to come home.

01:10:05.802 --> 01:10:07.535
I know you do, honey,

01:10:07.537 --> 01:10:09.971
but that's because
you're scared and
stupid right now,

01:10:09.973 --> 01:10:12.574
so you just sit tight,
and sleep on it, okay?

01:10:12.576 --> 01:10:14.309
Uh-huh. Okay.
Okay.

01:10:17.279 --> 01:10:19.280
Nice work, guys.

01:10:20.683 --> 01:10:22.417
Gary: I love you!

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:30.458
All right, you two.

01:10:30.460 --> 01:10:32.827
Looks like your lawyer
has saved your ass.

01:10:47.776 --> 01:10:48.843
Ginnie.

01:10:49.812 --> 01:10:51.312
What the hell, dad?

01:10:51.314 --> 01:10:53.681
I know.
Look, I was worried.

01:10:53.683 --> 01:10:57.018
You hadn't returned
voice mails or e-mails.

01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.486
I was on vacation,

01:10:58.488 --> 01:10:59.687
and I tried
to call you back

01:10:59.689 --> 01:11:00.989
as soon as I got
off the plane.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:02.323
Right. And of course

01:11:02.325 --> 01:11:04.392
then my phone
was dead, so...

01:11:04.394 --> 01:11:06.261
So you thought
it would be
a good idea

01:11:06.263 --> 01:11:08.563
to break into
my house with
my ex-boyfriend?

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:12.600
Look, I'm sorry, okay,

01:11:12.602 --> 01:11:14.469
but what are you doing
running off

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:16.571
without telling anybody
and not answering
your phone?

01:11:16.573 --> 01:11:18.673
We were
in bora bora

01:11:18.675 --> 01:11:19.874
trying to unplug,

01:11:19.876 --> 01:11:21.843
and I told mom.
Jesus.

01:11:25.481 --> 01:11:26.748
Dad, this is kip.

01:11:26.750 --> 01:11:28.549
It's a pleasure
to meet you, sir.

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:30.285
How do you do?

01:11:30.287 --> 01:11:33.054
I-I'm sorry about
the misunderstanding.

01:11:33.056 --> 01:11:34.355
It's my fault.

01:11:34.357 --> 01:11:35.857
That's very generous
of you,

01:11:35.859 --> 01:11:38.559
but I'm pretty sure
it's all my fault.

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:41.496
Hey. Kip.

01:11:41.498 --> 01:11:43.464
Uh, I'm Martin.

01:11:44.933 --> 01:11:47.769
Well, uh, since
we have your father's
rental car,

01:11:47.771 --> 01:11:49.304
you want to--
want to take him

01:11:49.306 --> 01:11:50.805
back to the hotel?
I'll take our car.

01:11:50.807 --> 01:11:51.839
I'll meet you there?
Yeah.

01:11:51.841 --> 01:11:53.941
Okay. I'm gonna go.

01:11:53.943 --> 01:11:55.910
It was nice
to meet everybody.

01:12:02.618 --> 01:12:05.053
I guess I'll--
I'm gonna be going, too.

01:12:05.055 --> 01:12:08.923
Um, ginnie,
I'm so sorry
about everything.

01:12:08.925 --> 01:12:11.726
It was really nice
to see you, though.

01:12:13.529 --> 01:12:15.463
Martin.

01:12:31.880 --> 01:12:33.815
Martin!

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.419
Look, ginnie,

01:12:38.421 --> 01:12:39.887
I'm truly--
no, no, no.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:41.723
You don't have
to apologize.

01:12:41.725 --> 01:12:44.058
I know how persuasive
my dad can be.

01:12:44.060 --> 01:12:48.129
Well, yeah, but go easy
on the guy, huh?

01:12:48.131 --> 01:12:50.798
I think he's been
in a pretty rough place
lately.

01:12:52.401 --> 01:12:53.735
I'll try.

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.575
How are you?

01:13:04.446 --> 01:13:05.880
You know, uh...

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:08.883
How have you been?

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:12.453
I actually
applied to ucla,

01:13:12.455 --> 01:13:15.590
architecture
and urban design,

01:13:15.592 --> 01:13:17.592
and I got in.
Wow.

01:13:17.594 --> 01:13:18.793
That's great.

01:13:19.862 --> 01:13:21.562
That's what you've
always wanted.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.531
That's--
that's great.

01:13:23.533 --> 01:13:24.832
I found out last week,

01:13:24.834 --> 01:13:29.604
and bora bora was kip's
congratulation gift.

01:13:29.606 --> 01:13:32.840
I'm sorry that you
had to find out
about him like this.

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:34.542
I didn't know
if I should call.

01:13:34.544 --> 01:13:36.477
Ah, no.
Kip seems great, ginnie.

01:13:36.479 --> 01:13:38.813
And you, you seem...

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:42.683
You seem really happy.

01:13:45.988 --> 01:13:47.889
And I'm happy for you.

01:14:09.511 --> 01:14:10.945
Your head hurt?

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:13.748
Little bit.

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:16.017
Good.

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.453
Look, ginnie--

01:14:18.455 --> 01:14:20.221
I don't want
to hear it, dad.

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:26.894
Hey, you didn't tell me
you were thinking about
going back to school.

01:14:26.896 --> 01:14:29.163
You're not in my life.

01:14:29.165 --> 01:14:31.599
Okay?
You are never here.

01:14:32.901 --> 01:14:34.135
When are you
gonna understand

01:14:34.137 --> 01:14:36.471
that you don't get
a say in what I do

01:14:36.473 --> 01:14:38.739
or where I go
or who with?

01:14:41.243 --> 01:14:43.144
Look...

01:14:43.146 --> 01:14:44.579
You're my dad,

01:14:44.581 --> 01:14:46.214
and I love you...

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:49.250
And I do know
that you love me.

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:54.689
Why do you have to be
such an asshole?

01:14:54.691 --> 01:14:57.592
I don't know.

01:14:57.594 --> 01:14:59.160
Why is the sky blue?

01:15:27.523 --> 01:15:28.623
Jimothy:
No, no, no.

01:15:28.625 --> 01:15:30.591
Ah, no, no, no, no.

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:36.664
Jimothy...

01:15:36.666 --> 01:15:38.299
I'm trying to beat
this level, dawg.

01:15:38.301 --> 01:15:39.534
Have some respect.

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:40.535
We need to talk.

01:15:40.537 --> 01:15:41.702
Well, I'm busy.

01:15:41.704 --> 01:15:43.137
And after
i beat this level,

01:15:43.139 --> 01:15:44.872
I'm gonna
do more drugs,

01:15:44.874 --> 01:15:47.275
have more sex
with this very
attractive couple,

01:15:47.277 --> 01:15:49.110
and then sleep
for 16 hours,

01:15:49.112 --> 01:15:50.912
so pencil you in
after that.

01:15:52.180 --> 01:15:54.982
Hey, it's time
for you to move now.

01:15:54.984 --> 01:15:57.018
Get your shit, and go.
Listen, man--

01:15:57.020 --> 01:15:59.086
you're 30 days
past due on rent,

01:15:59.088 --> 01:16:01.122
so consider it
an eviction.

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:02.557
You're done.

01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:07.061
This is mine.

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:14.969
You know, I find
your newfound confidence
intoxicating.

01:16:15.938 --> 01:16:17.905
What if we...

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:22.109
Figured out
a different way
to pay rent...

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.947
A physical way?

01:17:31.980 --> 01:17:33.180
Connie: Hello.

01:17:33.182 --> 01:17:34.649
Hey, Connie.

01:17:34.651 --> 01:17:36.317
I hope it's okay
i called.

01:17:36.319 --> 01:17:38.285
Frank?

01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:46.454
Mr. gallo.

01:18:46.456 --> 01:18:47.888
Jesus. Would you please

01:18:47.890 --> 01:18:49.256
fucking call me
frank already?

01:18:49.258 --> 01:18:51.358
Thanks for coming, frank.

01:18:51.360 --> 01:18:53.894
That's nice stuff
up there.

01:18:53.896 --> 01:18:57.131
Seriously,
really, really good.
I enjoyed it.

01:18:57.133 --> 01:18:58.199
Ah, thanks.

01:18:58.201 --> 01:18:59.767
I thought you were, uh--

01:18:59.769 --> 01:19:01.102
had to be in Geneva.

01:19:01.104 --> 01:19:03.270
I figured
I'd stick around here,

01:19:03.272 --> 01:19:05.306
spend a little time
with my daughter.

01:19:05.308 --> 01:19:06.941
You want a beer?

01:19:06.943 --> 01:19:08.008
Sure.

01:19:11.012 --> 01:19:14.348
You know, Martin,
you went to the mat
for me in a big way.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.316
I appreciate it.

01:19:15.318 --> 01:19:17.084
Well, I mean...

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:19.186
I won't forget it.

01:19:24.459 --> 01:19:26.460
Looks like
you got a fan there.

01:19:26.462 --> 01:19:28.028
Who?

01:19:28.030 --> 01:19:30.231
Oh, Lois?

01:19:30.233 --> 01:19:32.066
Yeah, I, uh...

01:19:32.068 --> 01:19:34.335
Martin, would you
please open your eyes?

01:19:34.337 --> 01:19:36.804
That girl is
clearly here for you.

01:19:36.806 --> 01:19:38.405
We met up
before the show.

01:19:38.407 --> 01:19:40.307
Did you, now?

01:19:40.309 --> 01:19:43.978
Yeah. You were
right about that whole
body-language thing.

01:19:45.013 --> 01:19:46.080
Look at you.

01:19:47.282 --> 01:19:48.916
I am impressed.

01:19:48.918 --> 01:19:50.317
Uh...

01:19:50.319 --> 01:19:52.787
I should probably go say hi
before the second set.

01:19:52.789 --> 01:19:54.321
I think you should.
Are you gonna be...

01:19:54.323 --> 01:19:55.823
I'm totally good.

01:19:55.825 --> 01:19:56.924
Okay.

01:19:57.826 --> 01:19:58.926
Um...

01:19:58.928 --> 01:19:59.960
Martin...

01:19:59.962 --> 01:20:01.462
Get over there.

01:20:51.613 --> 01:20:53.113
they sound
real good tonight.

01:20:53.115 --> 01:20:54.949
Yeah.
You Martin's dad?

01:20:54.951 --> 01:20:56.517
His dad? No, no, no.

01:20:56.519 --> 01:20:58.219
No, I'm, uh...

01:21:22.144 --> 01:21:23.344
whoo!
