00:31.820 --> 00:37.900
THE FANTASTIC PLANET

03:08.520 --> 03:10.045
She stopped moving.

03:10.080 --> 03:12.100
Now we can't play
with her any more.

03:15.200 --> 03:16.419
Careful! It's Mr. Sihn.

03:27.360 --> 03:31.360
Look, father.
A female Om and her baby.

03:31.395 --> 03:33.245
Is she dead?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.045
I'm afraid so, Tiwa.

03:35.080 --> 03:38.560
Why does the baby make noise?

03:38.595 --> 03:41.897
It's either frightened or hungry.

03:41.932 --> 03:44.846
We can't leave him.
May I keep him?

03:44.881 --> 03:47.725
Let me, father.
I'll take care of him.

03:47.760 --> 03:52.480
All right, Tiwa,
we can't let the animal die.

03:52.515 --> 03:56.817
He was the Great Master
of the Traag people.

03:56.852 --> 04:01.120
He saved my life
and took me into his home.

04:34.120 --> 04:35.310
Mother!

04:35.345 --> 04:36.500
Mother!

04:39.600 --> 04:44.485
See how cute the little Om is!

04:44.520 --> 04:47.760
His mother's dead.
I want to keep him.

04:47.795 --> 04:50.460
He is very pretty, Tiwa.

04:54.360 --> 04:58.645
You disturbed your mother's Meditation!

04:58.680 --> 05:02.840
Make that animal behave
or I'll take it away!

05:02.875 --> 05:05.780
Father, he got away.
He needs a collar.

05:49.080 --> 05:51.040
Learn to use the Watch.

05:52.840 --> 05:53.880
Now put the animal down.

06:13.880 --> 06:16.511
It's fun. Let me try.

06:26.800 --> 06:28.485
No so fast.

06:28.520 --> 06:30.560
The animal is delicate.

06:30.595 --> 06:34.417
You might hurt it.

06:34.452 --> 06:37.646
Did you name it?

06:37.681 --> 06:40.805
Tiwa, like me.

06:40.840 --> 06:46.040
That's not an Om's name.
Name it Frisky or Trusty.

06:46.075 --> 06:48.940
Watch him wiggle, the little devil!

06:50.640 --> 06:52.420
I'll name him Terr.

07:07.320 --> 07:09.565
I was forgotten!

07:09.600 --> 07:13.960
A baby Om is nothing compared
to Meditation!

07:13.995 --> 07:15.165
A weird virtual.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.720
Traags devoted
most of their time to it.

07:17.755 --> 07:20.000
It seemed to be chief concern.

07:53.320 --> 07:58.480
Oddly enough, the housing unit factory
on our Uva at Goham...

07:58.515 --> 08:01.297
has not met production levels.

08:01.332 --> 08:04.080
The machines show unusual wear...

08:04.115 --> 08:07.757
This wear causes the delay.

08:07.792 --> 08:11.400
Master Taj, can you explain?

08:11.435 --> 08:12.645
We don't know yet.

08:12.680 --> 08:16.720
Meanwhile we’ll use machines
from our reserve...

08:16.755 --> 08:18.797
to meet the schedule.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.805
I don't understand.

08:20.840 --> 08:25.140
The machines worked
perfectly until now.

08:25.175 --> 08:29.440
Have you had similar problems
on other Uvas?

08:30.520 --> 08:34.445
Only machines from our space flight...

08:34.480 --> 08:39.080
to planet Antax 4
have trouble completing their program.

08:39.115 --> 08:41.485
Master Sihn, our scientists...

08:41.520 --> 08:46.920
explain this loss as a break
in the sensory compensation system.

08:46.955 --> 08:52.320
Scientists also notice that animals
brought from planet Terra...

08:52.355 --> 08:56.640
have sovibon
and rather high intelligence.

08:56.675 --> 08:59.165
I am not sure that is true.

08:59.200 --> 09:03.440
Obviously,
the animal adapts rather well.

09:03.475 --> 09:05.737
But is that intelligence?

09:05.772 --> 09:08.526
The little pet you stroke...

09:08.561 --> 09:11.280
between Meditations may well...

09:11.315 --> 09:12.765
surprise you some day.

09:12.800 --> 09:16.200
Films made in Terra
show many traces of organized life.

09:45.200 --> 09:48.640
This ability to adapt, Master Kon

09:48.675 --> 09:52.045
may indicate advanced evolution.

09:52.080 --> 09:55.725
Oms have a much shorter
life span that we.

09:55.760 --> 09:59.480
But we must not forget
that they multiply much more rapidly.

09:59.515 --> 10:03.160
If the animal is intelligent,
Master Sihn...

10:03.195 --> 10:05.000
we have not yet noticed.

10:05.035 --> 10:07.525
What we do notice

10:07.560 --> 10:09.685
is the considerable damage...

10:09.720 --> 10:13.160
caused by Oms
on the Uvas of Jext and Telez.

10:13.195 --> 10:16.600
The numbers of tame Oms
is easy to control.

10:16.635 --> 10:19.125
But wild Oms probably exist...

10:19.160 --> 10:22.120
in much larger numbers
than most of us realize.

10:22.155 --> 10:23.645
We de-om the enclaves...

10:23.680 --> 10:27.360
of wild Oms every 3 cycles.
But I wonder if...

10:27.395 --> 10:29.045
that is often enough.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.360
Few weapons have a long-term effect.

10:32.395 --> 10:34.885
Drastic measures must be taken.

10:34.920 --> 10:37.960
New ways to fight them
are being researched.

10:37.995 --> 10:42.020
I doubt if they will suffice.

13:44.920 --> 13:50.280
Go play somewhere else.

13:50.315 --> 13:51.725
I'm very sorry.

13:51.760 --> 13:54.160
Imagination was so rich today too...

13:54.195 --> 13:55.365
That Om is a pest!

13:55.400 --> 13:59.400
Please, our children
all love those animals.

15:49.800 --> 15:52.885
I grew up fast
in that slow world.

15:52.920 --> 15:56.400
A Traag week was equal
to one of my years.

15:56.435 --> 15:59.127
I was only a live plaything.

15:59.162 --> 16:01.820
I was sometimes rebellious.

16:01.855 --> 16:04.020
Tiwa loved me.

16:06.120 --> 16:10.120
Terr loves Tiwa...

16:10.155 --> 16:12.005
Repeat!

16:12.040 --> 16:17.040
Terr loves Tiwa...
Repeat!

16:56.840 --> 17:01.120
Tiwa got her learning
from a headphone.

17:01.155 --> 17:05.400
Its lessons cut directly
into the brain...

17:05.435 --> 17:11.085
engraved on the memory forever.

17:11.119 --> 17:14.220
"Our Planet Ygam has one satellite...

17:14.255 --> 17:17.319
"the Fantastic Planet.
It is uninhabited

17:17.355 --> 17:19.285
"and used for Meditation.

17:19.319 --> 17:21.525
"Ygam is divided into several Uvas.

17:21.560 --> 17:25.880
"Uvas Strop and Yot
are natural and symmetrical.

17:25.915 --> 17:29.440
"Urtana,
the largest Uva, is covered

17:29.475 --> 17:31.797
"with blue assonic blocks.

17:31.832 --> 17:34.436
"Its temperature range...

17:34.471 --> 17:37.005
"is from 8 to 243 laics...

17:37.040 --> 17:40.760
"making ripocal
exploitation impossible...

17:40.795 --> 17:44.217
"Our Uva, Goham,
has a fepular inland sea...

17:44.252 --> 17:47.906
"stabilizing
the apenosh at about 20 laics.

17:47.941 --> 17:51.430
"Fixations bloc

17:51.465 --> 17:54.885
"Er-shaped globes regulate pressure.

17:54.920 --> 17:59.400
"All Uvas under go a cycle
of 3 seasons of unequal length.

17:59.435 --> 18:02.085
"The seasons of garus crystalization..."

18:02.120 --> 18:08.120
An accident enabled me
to acquire the Traags knowledge.

18:08.155 --> 18:12.037
"When the soil peels,
intense vegetation..."

18:12.072 --> 18:15.920
"replaces all nosks
with similar nosks."

18:15.955 --> 18:17.565
I liked the lessons.

18:17.600 --> 18:20.405
I tried to get the most out of them.

18:20.440 --> 18:24.080
"The cliffs
on the fepular sea are eroded...

18:24.115 --> 18:28.080
"by rains that often last long."

20:22.400 --> 20:24.925
Tiwa, bring your animal!

20:24.960 --> 20:28.565
Jurgal has his and we'll have some fun.

20:28.600 --> 20:32.800
I don't want him hurt.
Jurgal's animal is insane!

20:32.835 --> 20:36.165
Once, he almost tore off his ears!

20:36.200 --> 20:41.040
He won't damage your Om.
Come and play!

20:41.075 --> 20:45.040
Come and see!

21:25.800 --> 21:29.640
Let Terr fight,
it will be more fun.

21:29.675 --> 21:33.480
Terr will win,
he's a real demon!

21:33.515 --> 21:37.480
Now fight!

21:59.640 --> 22:02.360
He sings well.

22:02.395 --> 22:05.080
Terr can sing too.

22:07.440 --> 22:11.440
Sing, Terr. Go on!

22:14.800 --> 22:17.720
- He'll strangle him!
- He doesn't know what he's doing.

22:17.755 --> 22:21.720
What a mean animal!

23:13.960 --> 23:19.160
"It is simple to see
a tark's fladed muscles...

23:19.195 --> 23:23.160
"because the animal's
easily skinned..."

23:31.280 --> 23:33.240
Do you hear the Om?

23:33.275 --> 23:35.165
That's Tiwa's lesson!

23:35.200 --> 23:38.720
She loves Terr so much
that he is with her always.

23:38.755 --> 23:41.360
Can he understand what he says?

23:41.395 --> 23:42.965
I don't think so.

23:43.000 --> 23:48.120
Anyway, I'll forbid her
to keep Terr during infos.

23:48.155 --> 23:51.085
She must study seriously.

23:51.120 --> 23:53.600
"The liscinian muscle
of a trak's leg...

23:53.635 --> 23:57.600
"is a fleshy, fuliform vilok...

24:08.360 --> 24:11.140
"The molog is an enviparous animal...

"The entire surface of their walls...

24:16.515 --> 24:18.565
"is made up of little cells...

24:18.600 --> 24:21.840
"separated by leaves

24:21.875 --> 24:23.285
"Some scientists...

24:23.320 --> 24:28.600
"today believe it is not organure
but only gambous amalga...

24:28.635 --> 24:30.725
" an artificial structure... "

24:30.760 --> 24:33.960
Have you got Terr again
during you info?

24:33.995 --> 24:36.997
I told you to stop!

24:37.032 --> 24:39.965
Into the Omhouse!

24:40.000 --> 24:42.640
But father, he doesn't bother me...

24:42.675 --> 24:44.285
And he's so happy.

24:44.320 --> 24:48.320
The infos are for you!
Get back to work!

24:57.120 --> 25:02.840
It was time for the Traag children
to have their first Meditation...

25:02.875 --> 25:06.240
The initiation ceremony
was a major step...

25:06.275 --> 25:10.240
on their road to knowledge.

26:30.200 --> 26:34.420
After a while
I lost my intimacy with Tiwa.

26:34.455 --> 26:38.547
As she grew up,
she gave up her playthings.

26:38.582 --> 26:42.640
Deprived of lessons,
I decided to run away.

27:15.960 --> 27:18.540
Mother, I can't find Terr.

27:18.575 --> 27:21.120
And my headphones are gone.

27:21.155 --> 27:23.405
Use your bracelet!

27:23.440 --> 27:27.320
If he's far away, it'll hurt him.

27:27.355 --> 27:31.200
Put your bracelet on maximum, please.

27:31.235 --> 27:35.200
No, mother...

28:16.200 --> 28:20.280
You're pretty stupid.
Like all tame Oms!

28:20.315 --> 28:21.885
You have a collar too.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.800
It’s a fake, to fool the Traags.

28:24.835 --> 28:27.205
What's that?

28:27.240 --> 28:29.200
The Traags invented it.

28:29.235 --> 28:31.125
What?

28:31.160 --> 28:34.120
The Traags made it.

28:34.155 --> 28:38.565
Listen!

28:38.600 --> 28:41.285
"Valio, cycle, info 4...

28:41.320 --> 28:43.880
"You will observe

"Notice that we look

28:53.795 --> 28:57.760
Don't worry,
it's not dangerous.

29:01.920 --> 29:03.805
Where are you taking it?

29:03.840 --> 29:07.840
- I don't know.
- Come with me!

30:08.440 --> 30:13.360
My new friend took me to her people
who lived hidden in the Big Tree.

30:13.395 --> 30:17.360
deep in an abandoned park.

30:20.920 --> 30:23.920
As a silly tame Om, my first meeting

30:23.955 --> 30:27.920
with wild Oms was a failure.

30:42.160 --> 30:46.160
Don't touch that case,
it's a trap!

31:04.440 --> 31:07.920
Since I brought
the headphones of knowledge...

31:07.955 --> 31:11.097
the wizard opposed me at once!

31:11.132 --> 31:14.240
We've brought 5 cases, Chief.

31:14.275 --> 31:16.165
What? Is that all?

31:16.200 --> 31:19.080
One of them was a trap and Speed is dead.

31:19.115 --> 31:21.600
He knew it was a trap.

31:21.635 --> 31:23.525
He's a tame Om.

31:23.560 --> 31:26.640
He ran away with a Traag device.

31:26.675 --> 31:29.720
It taught him to read Traag writing.

31:32.400 --> 31:35.640
He knows what's in the cases?

31:35.675 --> 31:39.237
In that one?

31:39.272 --> 31:42.800
Color powder.

Why interrupt the info?

35:15.355 --> 35:17.640
Traag knowledge is bad.

35:17.675 --> 35:19.877
We don't need it.

35:19.912 --> 35:22.136
We are not tame Oms.

35:22.171 --> 35:24.325
It is great offense!

35:24.360 --> 35:28.560
You must battle according to the Law.

35:28.595 --> 35:31.440
Bring the combat animals!

36:19.200 --> 36:24.000
You win. Stay with us Oms
of the Big Tree.

36:24.035 --> 36:26.165
You can be of use to us.

36:26.200 --> 36:29.120
Tomorrow we go on an expedition.

38:03.680 --> 38:08.320
It was my first expedition
to steal Traag food.

38:08.355 --> 38:10.680
We brought a great deal back.

38:24.120 --> 38:26.960
Be brave,
the Big Tree isn't far.

38:32.920 --> 38:35.040
The Hollow-Bush bandits!
Look out!

38:52.000 --> 38:54.565
Why attack us?

38:54.600 --> 38:57.160
They're from the Hollow Bush.
Beware of them.

38:57.840 --> 39:01.280
They are thieves
from the other side of the park.

39:30.280 --> 39:33.940
"This may well be
how Meditation originated.

39:33.975 --> 39:37.565
"Some believe
that Zarek is immortal and...

39:37.600 --> 39:42.080
"that from the flames of time
he reappears in infinitely varied...

39:42.115 --> 39:44.245
"whirling reality...

39:44.280 --> 39:48.160
"to combat the Traags will to die.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.840
"Actually

39:56.000 --> 39:58.285
"driving out the Jankos made...

39:58.320 --> 40:01.960
"the Traags develop
a spirit of enterprise..."

40:01.995 --> 40:04.045
The Oms are learning

40:04.080 --> 40:08.080
if only we had more headphones.

40:10.520 --> 40:13.780
You know as much as the Traags.

40:13.815 --> 40:17.040
I am barely learning to write.

40:17.075 --> 40:18.320
Look.

43:26.560 --> 43:28.765
Are you sure?

43:28.800 --> 43:30.845
Did you read it right?

43:30.880 --> 43:34.920
All the park walls read "de-om"!

43:34.955 --> 43:36.285
What does it mean?

43:36.320 --> 43:39.800
The Traags want to kill all the Oms!

43:39.835 --> 43:41.085
Long ago...

43:41.120 --> 43:43.680
I saw them de-om the park.

43:43.715 --> 43:45.245
It was horrible!

43:45.280 --> 43:49.520
But now on our tree,
there's not much danger.

43:49.555 --> 43:51.685
What will we do?

43:51.720 --> 43:55.840
- It had to come.
- Anyway, we have time to prepare.

43:55.875 --> 43:58.357
We'll post sentries.

43:58.392 --> 44:00.805
They'll slaughter us...

44:00.840 --> 44:03.540
to punish us for stealing knowledge.

44:03.575 --> 44:06.205
Let us pray to the Fantastic Planet.

44:06.240 --> 44:09.480
Sentries will warn us when they come.
Tomorrow we shall see.

45:37.040 --> 45:40.640
What are you doing on our land?

45:44.080 --> 45:48.120
I came to warn you.
The Traags intend to de-om the park.

45:48.155 --> 45:50.920
De-om!
You don't say!

45:50.955 --> 45:52.245
How do you know?

45:52.280 --> 45:55.325
One of us read it on the wall!

45:55.360 --> 45:59.800
Can Big-Tree Oms
read Traag writing now?

45:59.835 --> 46:01.765
Don't listen to him!

46:01.800 --> 46:05.040
It's a trap to get us out
of the Hollow Bush!

46:05.075 --> 46:08.000
Believe me, the Traags will de-om!

46:08.035 --> 46:10.765
Take him away!

46:10.800 --> 46:13.520
Someone go look at the walls!

50:24.600 --> 50:25.360
Listen!

50:26.320 --> 50:28.320
- Traags!
- Quiet!

50:40.120 --> 50:41.485
I smell Oms here.

50:41.520 --> 50:43.880
That vermin!
The Masters should...

50:43.915 --> 50:45.965
de-om more often!

50:46.000 --> 50:49.400
It's not bad to have pet Oms...
They're fun.

50:49.435 --> 50:52.005
But all those wild Oms...
They steal.

50:52.040 --> 50:55.920
They're dirty
and multiply appallingly fast.

50:55.955 --> 50:58.120
Look...
A nest by the walk.

50:58.155 --> 51:00.080
See... A whole colony.

51:00.115 --> 51:01.400
Let's kill Them.

51:40.320 --> 51:43.365
Chief is dead.

51:43.400 --> 51:45.725
Stop weeping like children.

51:45.760 --> 51:51.080
We must go
where the Traags can't find us.

51:51.115 --> 51:54.320
I know a place,
I'll take you there.

53:07.920 --> 53:11.560
This road leads
to an abandoned rocket dump.

53:12.000 --> 53:14.080
We'll be safe there.

54:00.600 --> 54:04.920
I regret that we de-om
only every 3 cycles!

54:05.040 --> 54:08.600
This killing proves
it is not enough!

54:08.760 --> 54:11.400
A Traag murdered!
It's unbelievable!

54:11.520 --> 54:13.800
Are we so weak
that Oms can kill us...

54:13.960 --> 54:15.000
so easily?

54:15.600 --> 54:19.560
Wild Oms are much more numerous
than we thought.

54:19.840 --> 54:21.600
The body showed many...

54:21.760 --> 54:26.560
bites and wounds, said Traag
who managed to escape slaughter.

54:26.720 --> 54:29.120
Oms' bites were very numerous.

54:32.480 --> 54:35.840
Every day wild Oms become bolder!

54:35.960 --> 54:38.360
They multiply at a terrifying rate!

54:38.480 --> 54:42.640
Master Sihn,
it is disturbing to note

54:42.760 --> 54:44.400
that your Uva at Telez

54:44.520 --> 54:47.080
is not the only one that has been

54:47.360 --> 54:49.480
very difficult to de-om.

54:49.600 --> 54:50.840
Two other Uvas...

54:51.000 --> 54:53.640
Goham and Urtana...

54:53.760 --> 54:56.240
have had similar problems...

54:56.640 --> 55:00.000
Near the murdered Traag we found...

55:00.160 --> 55:03.200
two surprisingly well organized lairs.

55:03.360 --> 55:06.600
Most disturbing of all was...

55:06.720 --> 55:08.280
that in one of the lairs...

55:08.400 --> 55:11.960
cases were sorted
according to contents.

55:12.080 --> 55:15.200
But they were unopened.
How could the Oms

55:15.360 --> 55:17.440
know what they contained?

55:17.720 --> 55:21.880
It is high time
to take efficient measures!

55:22.000 --> 55:25.040
I suggest we de-om twice a cycle.

55:25.160 --> 55:29.680
I also request strict regulation
of breeding...

55:29.880 --> 55:32.280
and selling of tame Oms.

55:32.400 --> 55:34.680
Too often they turn wild again...

55:34.920 --> 55:37.480
and go join the throngs of Oms...

55:37.600 --> 55:40.320
living in parks
and other isolated areas.

55:40.480 --> 55:45.240
We must use the new, much-discussed
de-om-ing devices at last.

55:45.360 --> 55:49.480
We must exterminate all wild Oms.
And I ask you:

55:49.600 --> 55:52.280
Should we keep our tame Oms?

55:52.440 --> 55:56.960
We are wrong to believe Oms
are merely vicious animals.

55:57.080 --> 55:59.000
If we do, we may commit...

55:59.120 --> 56:01.720
an error of serious consequences.

56:32.240 --> 56:33.800
Ygam had..

56:33.960 --> 56:36.760
3 seasons equal to...

56:36.920 --> 56:38.640
15 of our years.

56:49.280 --> 56:52.360
The Traag rocket graveyard
was abandoned.

56:52.480 --> 56:54.880
There we built our city.

56:55.000 --> 56:58.120
We planned to go
to the Fantastic Planet.

56:58.760 --> 57:01.320
Many tame and wild Oms
came to join us.

57:49.320 --> 57:52.360
Knowledge acquired
from the headphones...

57:52.560 --> 57:54.680
enabled us to reduce...

57:54.800 --> 57:56.640
Traag rockets...

57:56.800 --> 57:58.600
to our size.

58:07.080 --> 58:11.920
"Trinur is a metal
that palsifies Matwar

58:12.200 --> 58:16.760
"top-grade reculid gives it
a remarkable metallic shine."

58:24.120 --> 58:25.760
We have succeeded, Terr.

58:25.880 --> 58:27.400
Two rockets are for testing.

58:27.720 --> 58:29.000
We will start with those.

58:29.120 --> 58:32.520
- It's only a matter of work and time.
- We must hurry!

58:32.960 --> 58:35.840
Om informers say...

58:35.960 --> 58:38.240
that a large-scale
de-om-ing is near!

58:38.360 --> 58:40.840
They may know where we are.

01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.600
We must send up
our two rockets at once...

01:01:05.960 --> 01:01:08.480
to see if we can live
on the Fantastic Planet.

01:01:08.920 --> 01:01:10.720
We cannot wait any longer!

01:01:10.840 --> 01:01:14.400
Too bad. I can't go with you.

01:01:14.640 --> 01:01:18.000
I'm not afraid.
I'm sure you'll succeed.

01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:20.800
I know you will build...

01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.440
a new world
where Oms can be happy...

01:01:24.560 --> 01:01:26.120
far away from the Traags.

01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:29.480
The Fantastic Planet
will be our planet...

01:01:29.960 --> 01:01:32.560
a world for our children.

01:01:32.760 --> 01:01:34.400
You must go!

01:01:34.920 --> 01:01:36.800
You must hurry!

01:01:37.480 --> 01:01:38.560
You must...

01:03:20.720 --> 01:03:24.280
We had discovered
the secret of the Traags.

01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:28.440
The Spheres of Meditation there
enabled Traags to meet...

01:03:28.600 --> 01:03:32.160
beings from other galaxies
and hold strange nuptial rites.

01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:39.320
This union gave them vital energy
which they needed...

01:03:39.440 --> 01:03:42.600
and enabled them to reproduce.

01:04:17.160 --> 01:04:18.880
We were afraid...

01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:22.320
The statues feet
might damage our rockets.

01:04:31.040 --> 01:04:34.200
We found
the only weak point of the Traags.

01:04:36.080 --> 01:04:39.080
On Ygam, the de-om-ing was halted.

01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:24.760
Never have the Traags
been in such great danger!

01:05:24.880 --> 01:05:27.760
Our entire civilization is threatened!

01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:29.960
The Oms are taking revenge.

01:05:30.080 --> 01:05:33.000
They have incredible
scientific knowledge.

01:05:33.320 --> 01:05:35.040
They must be stopped!

01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.320
It may be too late.

01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:42.680
Neither Oms nor Traags...

01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:45.880
will profit from destruction.

01:05:46.160 --> 01:05:50.200
We must try
to make peace.

01:06:05.800 --> 01:06:07.640
"Since the Sihn era,

01:06:07.760 --> 01:06:12.440
"the Traag civilization has undergone
a remarkable evolution.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.640
"The Oms, instructed
by our philosophy and...

01:06:15.800 --> 01:06:16.960
"technology...

01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:19.120
"now provide the Traags with...

01:06:19.240 --> 01:06:22.880
"dynamics and
a new way of thinking.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.080
Our planet now has two satellites,
one natural and one artificial.

01:06:28.200 --> 01:06:31.200
"The natural one, the Fantastic Planet...

01:06:31.235 --> 01:06:33.480
"is kept for Traag Meditation.

01:06:33.600 --> 01:06:37.680
"The artificial one was made by Oms.
They named it Terr.

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.920
"Oms live in huge cities
on the various Uvas."
