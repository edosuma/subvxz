{\an3}JACK:
Dylan!

01:45.355 --> 01:47.857
Yeah?

01:47.941 --> 01:50.318
{\an5}Hang on, I was gonna
move the car.
That's okay, I'll get it.

01:50.401 --> 01:51.361
{\an4}Yeah?
Yeah.
Thanks, Dad.

01:51.444 --> 01:53.321
{\an3}Well hey, what are
dad's for?

01:55.448 --> 01:57.700
Dad!

01:57.784 --> 01:59.410
Jack!

02:03.331 --> 02:07.335
(screaming)

02:07.418 --> 02:09.378
(gasping)

02:16.094 --> 02:19.389
We're gonna be dreaming about
this for the rest of our lives.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.724
{\an1}You might as well
get used to it.

02:21.808 --> 02:24.227
Except it's not just a dream.

02:24.310 --> 02:25.395
It's... It's a nightmare.

02:25.478 --> 02:29.732
It's our nightmare.

02:29.816 --> 02:33.862
Jack's dead,
we might as well be.

02:38.199 --> 02:41.744

{\an5}DAVID:
<i>How am I supposed to be in</i>
<i>two places at one time?</i>

02:43.496 --> 02:45.957
It's humanly impossible.

02:46.040 --> 02:48.209
Of all the days to schedule
my first recording session.

02:48.293 --> 02:49.794
{\an1}You know, you're telling
me about your career

02:49.878 --> 02:51.671
as if I care-- I don't.

02:51.754 --> 02:52.589
{\an3}So, what am I supposed
to tell them?

02:52.672 --> 02:55.216
{\an3}Icon Records is
never gonna understand

02:55.300 --> 02:56.009
why I can't be
there tomorrow.

02:56.092 --> 02:57.927
{\an1}Two weeks ago I
would've been happy

02:58.011 --> 02:58.928
to intercede on your behalf,

02:59.012 --> 03:01.472
{\an3}but since you sold
me down the river, David,

03:01.556 --> 03:05.101
{\an3}why don't you make
like a tree... and leave?

03:05.184 --> 03:07.103
I can't believe this.
They're all over his front yard.

03:07.186 --> 03:08.396
Isn't that illegal?

03:08.479 --> 03:09.397
{\an5}...whether they have any
suspects in connection
It depends.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.233
with yesterdays' brutal
gangland-style murder

03:12.317 --> 03:13.735
of one-time Beverly Hills
financier, Jack McKay...

03:13.818 --> 03:15.320
What time is the funeral?

03:15.403 --> 03:18.239
{\an1}10:00 a.m.

03:18.323 --> 03:19.449
Did you call him, Andrea?

03:19.532 --> 03:22.327
I didn't know what to say.

03:22.410 --> 03:24.162
{\an3}Me either.

03:26.205 --> 03:29.125
(indistinct clamoring)

03:29.208 --> 03:30.752
Hey, Dylan...

03:32.337 --> 03:33.046
{\an3}you didn't think
you were gonna

03:33.129 --> 03:34.339
{\an3}get rid of me
that easy did you?

03:34.422 --> 03:38.009
{\an4}Lady, I'm trying,
I'm trying to reach
Iris McKay...

03:38.092 --> 03:42.013
McKay. M-C-K-A-Y.

03:42.096 --> 03:43.640
{\an3}Just hang up
already, will ya?

03:43.723 --> 03:44.349
What are you cryin'
to mama for, huh?

03:44.432 --> 03:47.018
I mean what did she ever do us?

03:47.101 --> 03:47.810
Excuse, excuse me?

03:47.894 --> 03:49.562
Did you get ahold
of your mom yet?

03:49.646 --> 03:51.522
You know where
she's at, man.

03:51.606 --> 03:53.650
The woman is off in woo-woo land

03:53.733 --> 03:55.818
searching for
the meaning of life.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.528
Dylan, are you okay?

03:57.612 --> 04:00.365
{\an1}Hey, can I leave
a message with you?

04:00.448 --> 04:03.326
Yeah, tell her Jack McKay
got blown to bits

04:03.409 --> 04:03.952
in Venice, California,
and Dylan thought

04:04.035 --> 04:05.453
she might just wanna know.

04:05.536 --> 04:09.332
Tell her that Dylan called.

04:09.415 --> 04:10.458
Aloha.

04:10.541 --> 04:14.295
Still no luck, huh?

04:14.379 --> 04:15.171
Not at all.

04:15.254 --> 04:17.173
{\an6}DYLAN:
Come on, man,
let's bail.

04:17.257 --> 04:18.007
Come on, let's go while
we've got the chance.

04:18.091 --> 04:19.716
We could be in Baja
in two hours.

04:27.934 --> 04:30.478
{\an3}Dylan, I just, I wish
there was something I could do

04:30.561 --> 04:33.189
to make you feel better.

04:33.272 --> 04:34.524
So do I, Kel.

04:34.607 --> 04:37.402
(knocking)

04:37.485 --> 04:38.486
Damn it! Not now!

04:38.569 --> 04:40.029
{\an3}God, what do
they want now?

04:40.113 --> 04:41.364
You know
what they want, man!

04:41.447 --> 04:42.365
They want to sell newspapers.

04:42.448 --> 04:43.491
Should I answer it?

04:43.574 --> 04:45.785
They want to put us
in a freak show!

04:47.412 --> 04:49.372
{\an1}Dylan, what should
I tell them?

04:49.455 --> 04:50.915
Tell 'em I split.

04:50.999 --> 04:52.750
(knocking)

04:53.751 --> 04:54.711
Mr. Walsh.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.713
Hi, Kelly.

04:56.796 --> 04:58.589
Come in before they
take your picture!

04:58.673 --> 04:59.924
This is crazy.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.884
{\an3}They've been camped out
there all day.

05:01.968 --> 05:02.510
Where is he?

05:02.593 --> 05:04.387
He's back there.

05:04.470 --> 05:05.722
{\an3}He's not doing
very good though.

05:05.805 --> 05:07.432
{\an1}I know, honey.
Let me talk to him.

05:16.816 --> 05:18.901
I'm so sorry, son.

05:18.985 --> 05:20.445
Yeah.

05:23.531 --> 05:24.907
Where you going?

05:24.991 --> 05:27.368
I don't know, but
I can't stay here.

05:27.452 --> 05:28.911
That's why I came over.

05:28.995 --> 05:31.581
{\an1}We want you to come back and
stay with us for a while.

05:31.664 --> 05:34.542
{\an3}Thanks, Jim, but Brenda's
made it pretty clear

05:34.625 --> 05:35.585
{\an3}she doesn't want
anything to do with me.

05:35.668 --> 05:38.755
{\an1}Apparently she's had
a change of heart.

05:38.838 --> 05:42.133
She was the one who insisted
I come here and bring you back.

05:47.889 --> 05:48.931
Are you gonna be okay, Kelly?

05:49.015 --> 05:50.058
{\an1}Yeah. I'm just gonna
go on home.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.059
{\an3}All right.

05:51.142 --> 05:53.102
Can you give us a minute?

05:53.186 --> 05:54.604
{\an5}JIM:
Out of the way, please.
Out of the way.

05:54.687 --> 05:56.230
{\an3}Let him through.
Any leads yet, Dylan?

05:56.314 --> 05:57.440
Dylan, have you gotten any sleep
since the death of your Dad?

05:57.523 --> 05:58.566
{\an3}Let us through.
Excuse us...

05:58.649 --> 06:01.110
Any comment at all...

06:01.194 --> 06:02.445
(reporters clamoring)

06:02.528 --> 06:04.822
{\an1}Come on, give us
the scoop.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.283
What about the allegations
against your father, Dylan?

06:07.366 --> 06:08.284
What's the story?

06:08.367 --> 06:11.329
{\an1}Dylan, just a comment.
Do you have anything to say?

06:18.544 --> 06:20.630
{\an6}BORMAN:
So what do you
propose we do, genius?

06:20.713 --> 06:23.132
Kidnap the kid, in front of the
eyewitness news team?

06:23.216 --> 06:24.467
Yeah, well you guys
blew this, not me,

06:24.550 --> 06:28.596
so we either do it my way or you
find yourself another cowboy.

06:38.940 --> 06:41.484
{\an1}You know, Bren, you look
like you could use

06:41.567 --> 06:45.488
a little Rocky Road-Butter Pecan
combo right about now.

06:45.571 --> 06:47.031
Now?

06:47.115 --> 06:49.492
Yeah, right.

06:49.575 --> 06:52.036
Listen, you letting Dylan stay
here is a really nice gesture.

06:52.120 --> 06:53.663
Yeah.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.626
What's wrong?

06:58.709 --> 07:01.671
I'm just kind of scared.

07:01.754 --> 07:03.673
So's he.

07:03.756 --> 07:06.884
I think they're here.

07:06.968 --> 07:10.054
{\an1}A little orange sherbet?
Last chance...

07:10.138 --> 07:11.514
Where's Dylan?

07:11.597 --> 07:16.602
{\an3}Uh, he's looking at
the backyard.

07:29.907 --> 07:31.534
Hey, D.

07:31.617 --> 07:34.328
Hey, B. How you doing?

07:34.412 --> 07:36.038
How you doing?

07:36.122 --> 07:37.999
I'm here.

07:40.168 --> 07:42.211
{\an3}You want me to take
these bags up for you?

07:42.295 --> 07:44.505
What are you, the bellboy?

07:44.589 --> 07:48.551
For you... yeah.

07:50.428 --> 07:52.555
{\an1}You know what I love
about your backyard, man?

07:52.638 --> 07:54.682
What?

07:54.765 --> 07:56.684
It looks the same
today, you know,

07:56.767 --> 07:58.603
I mean the same as
it did yesterday,

07:58.686 --> 08:01.898
{\an1}the day before that,
and the day before that.

08:01.981 --> 08:05.234
{\an3}Well, you know us Walshes,
boring and predictable.

08:05.318 --> 08:08.279
All except one.

08:08.362 --> 08:10.072
Are you guys
gonna come inside?

08:10.156 --> 08:11.407
It's pretty cold out here.

08:17.830 --> 08:20.583
You know, when
our Aunt Sheila died,

08:20.666 --> 08:21.959
I didn't want to go
to the funeral.

08:22.043 --> 08:23.419
Yeah, neither did I.

08:23.502 --> 08:24.587
But I felt better
afterwards.

08:24.670 --> 08:25.588
Saying good-bye and all...

08:25.671 --> 08:27.590
So what I'm I supposed
to go have a good cry

08:27.673 --> 08:29.258
with the press
breathing down my neck?

08:29.342 --> 08:31.427
They won't show up
to the memorial services,

08:31.510 --> 08:32.428
I promise you that.

08:32.510 --> 08:33.429
Yeah, we won't let them.

08:33.511 --> 08:35.431
What difference does it
make if I go or not?

08:35.514 --> 08:36.557
You guys, Jack's gone.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.059
Dylan, he's still here.

08:39.143 --> 08:40.727
Just like Aunt Sheila's
still here.

08:40.811 --> 08:43.105
Oh, what Bren, in spirit?

08:43.188 --> 08:44.148
Yes.

08:44.232 --> 08:45.441
{\an4}DYLAN:
I don't believe
in that junk.

08:45.524 --> 08:46.525
When your number's up,

08:46.609 --> 08:48.486
your number's up.
Jack took a hit, and that's it.

08:48.569 --> 08:52.531
Well, you don't have
to decide right now.

08:52.615 --> 08:54.450
I mean, maybe
you'll feel differently

08:54.533 --> 08:57.161
after you sleep on it.

08:57.245 --> 08:59.413
Look, Bren, I want to thank you
for letting me stay here.

08:59.497 --> 09:00.831
{\an3}Dylan, you don't
have to say anything.

09:00.915 --> 09:05.086
In fact, I want
to apologize to you.

09:05.169 --> 09:07.463
I'm sorry it took me a whole day
to swallow my pride,

09:07.546 --> 09:08.673
and do the right thing.

09:08.756 --> 09:11.425
{\an1}BRANDON:
I... I think you need

09:11.509 --> 09:12.343
another pillow.

09:12.426 --> 09:15.221
I'm just gonna go
in the hall and get it.

09:25.439 --> 09:27.149
You know, it's going to be okay.

09:27.233 --> 09:29.694
Just keep telling
me that, will ya?

09:34.865 --> 09:36.701
(sighs)

09:39.370 --> 09:41.497
KELLY:
<i>I just felt so useless.</i>

09:41.580 --> 09:43.874
I mean, I kept trying
to reassure Dylan

09:43.958 --> 09:46.294
that everything was gonna
be okay,

09:46.377 --> 09:48.796
{\an3}but I just don't think I was
getting through to him.

09:48.879 --> 09:51.674
He's probably still in shock.

09:51.757 --> 09:55.886
{\an5}Or maybe he knows that
I don't know what the
hell I'm talking about.

09:55.970 --> 09:58.472
{\an4}No, Kelly, you've never
been in a situation
like this before.

09:58.556 --> 10:01.892
{\an4}I mean, you can't expect
to know how to take care
of him right now.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.103
I bet the Walshes do.

10:04.186 --> 10:05.604
What's that supposed to mean?

10:08.441 --> 10:10.151
Dinner's ready.

10:10.234 --> 10:11.360
{\an1}You are staying,
aren't you?

10:11.444 --> 10:13.029
Well, what are we
having for dinner?

10:13.112 --> 10:14.864
Meat loaf and mashed potatoes.

10:14.947 --> 10:16.198
Yum!

10:16.282 --> 10:17.241
Ew.

10:17.325 --> 10:18.743
What, you don't
like meat loaf?

10:18.826 --> 10:22.038
No, it's just so retro...
so fattening.

10:22.121 --> 10:25.416
(phone ringing)

10:25.499 --> 10:28.044
Hello.

10:28.127 --> 10:28.878
Yeah, he is.

10:28.961 --> 10:29.879
Hold on.

10:29.962 --> 10:30.880
It's your producer.

10:30.963 --> 10:33.507
{\an1}Oh, God.

10:33.591 --> 10:35.843
{\an1}Uh, hello.

10:35.926 --> 10:38.554
Oh, great, great.

10:38.637 --> 10:39.013
{\an1}All right,
thanks a lot, Serge.

10:39.096 --> 10:41.057
I'll see you then.

10:41.140 --> 10:42.558
So you were able to reschedule?

10:42.641 --> 10:43.726
Not exactly.

10:43.809 --> 10:46.896
David, I thought you were going
to tell them

10:46.979 --> 10:49.148
about the funeral

10:49.231 --> 10:50.733
Can we talk about
this later, please?

10:50.816 --> 10:52.943
Fine.
We'll talk about it at dinner.

10:54.862 --> 10:56.947
Aren't you coming?

10:57.031 --> 10:58.699
{\an3}No. I just feel
like being alone.

10:58.783 --> 11:01.410
You just don't feel like
eating the meat loaf.

11:10.378 --> 11:13.422
It's disgusting,
gentlemen, disgusting.

11:13.506 --> 11:15.007
Who's winning?

11:15.091 --> 11:16.217
The bad guys.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.344
Hey, don't turn it
off on my account.

11:18.427 --> 11:19.887
It's all right,
this game's over.

11:19.970 --> 11:22.765
The Pistons never even
showed up.

11:22.848 --> 11:23.766
Easy come, easy go.

11:23.849 --> 11:26.394
So, how much you
on the hook for?

11:26.477 --> 11:28.354
Well, over the whole season,

11:28.437 --> 11:30.856
I'm pretty much even,
maybe down a little.

11:30.940 --> 11:33.234
It's all right, I got two games
tomorrow though.

11:33.317 --> 11:34.652
I fully expect to bounce back

11:34.735 --> 11:36.404
and possibly even be in
the plus side.

11:36.487 --> 11:37.863
Always do.

11:40.491 --> 11:41.951
{\an3}You must be
pretty beat, huh?

11:42.034 --> 11:45.162
Man, I haven't slept
in two days.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.791
Yeah, well, I'll try
not to snore.

11:48.874 --> 11:51.752
{\an1}Thanks.

11:51.836 --> 11:52.920
Good night, man.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.463
{\an1}Night.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.325
Hey, Dude.

12:23.409 --> 12:26.203
{\an3}I been
expecting you.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.456
What, you gonna make me
drink alone?

12:28.539 --> 12:32.751
{\an3}You can't tell me
you don't want any.

12:36.922 --> 12:37.506
Where you going?

12:37.590 --> 12:39.341
You gonna go call your sponsor?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.345
So that he can tell you

12:43.429 --> 12:45.264
{\an3}that he understands
how you feel?

12:45.347 --> 12:47.850
{\an3}Or you'd rather
wake up Jim and Cindy,

12:47.933 --> 12:51.437
so they can tell you
you've been like a son to them.

12:51.520 --> 12:53.522
Quit torturing
yourself, man.

12:53.606 --> 12:55.900
What do you want, Dylan?

12:55.983 --> 12:58.360
You wanna, you wanna hate him,
so you won't miss him?

12:58.444 --> 13:01.989
{\an3}That's not gonna work,
'cause you just remember

13:02.072 --> 13:06.368
{\an3}the other day, he put
his arm around you

13:06.452 --> 13:08.204
and just for that second

13:08.287 --> 13:10.539
{\an3}it felt like somebody
loved you.

13:10.623 --> 13:15.252
It's a lose-lose situation,
you know?

13:15.336 --> 13:16.504
I mean, it's a classic case--

13:16.587 --> 13:18.672
we're going down.

13:18.756 --> 13:21.675
{\an3}What's it
gonna be,

13:21.759 --> 13:26.931
stone-cold sober...
or feeling no pain?

13:51.497 --> 13:53.415
{\an1}What does Dylan like
for breakfast?

13:53.499 --> 13:54.291
Black coffee?

13:54.375 --> 13:56.293
Dylan's not really
a morning person.

13:56.377 --> 13:58.879
Except when he's surfing.

13:58.963 --> 14:01.173
Yeah well, he's not
going surfing today.

14:01.257 --> 14:02.967
{\an1}You know he told me he hadn't
slept since the explosion.

14:03.050 --> 14:05.761
{\an1}He went out like
a light last night.

14:05.844 --> 14:07.596
{\an3}Well, we'll just
let him sleep then.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.431
We don't have to go
for another hour.

14:09.515 --> 14:12.601
{\an1}Is that reporter from
Channel 12 still out there?

14:12.685 --> 14:14.770
Nope. Nobody's out there.

14:14.853 --> 14:17.439
{\an3}But this... on
the front page again.

14:17.523 --> 14:18.649
Dylan's picture no less.

14:18.732 --> 14:19.525
You're kidding.

14:19.608 --> 14:22.403
Why can't they
just leave him alone?

14:22.486 --> 14:23.862
Well, it's a valid
news story, Bren.

14:23.946 --> 14:25.739
{\an6}What does it say?
Well, there are
two articles.

14:25.823 --> 14:28.117
"Death of a Crooked Salesman"

14:28.200 --> 14:29.994
and "FBI to Probe McKay's
Mob Ties".

14:30.077 --> 14:32.496
I don't think we should let
Dylan see this this morning.

14:32.580 --> 14:33.455
{\an1}CINDY:
I agree.

14:33.539 --> 14:35.749
I think he's had enough
news for one week.

14:35.833 --> 14:37.585
I think we all have.

14:41.046 --> 14:43.507
Kelly, you're
not even dressed yet.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.467
I'm sick, Donna.
I really don't feel good.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.302
Kelly...

14:46.385 --> 14:47.177
I don't.

14:47.261 --> 14:49.138
I have stomach cramps.

14:49.221 --> 14:50.180
So take an aspirin.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.516
{\an1}The service starts in
a half hour.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.351
{\an1}Oh, Donna,
I tried saving you

14:54.435 --> 14:56.145
{\an1}the trip over here,
but you'd already left.

14:56.228 --> 14:57.980
Why, what, what's the matter?

14:58.063 --> 15:00.316
Nothing. Just we have
to take separate cars

15:00.399 --> 15:01.483
because I'm going straight

15:01.567 --> 15:02.693
to the recording session
afterwards.

15:02.776 --> 15:05.821
But Brandon said we have to go
to the Walshes' afterwards

15:05.904 --> 15:07.489
to pay our condolences.

15:07.573 --> 15:08.699
{\an3}Now that is something I'm
definitely not doing.

15:08.782 --> 15:11.327
Why not? Are you planning on
having a stomachache all day?

15:11.410 --> 15:13.329
{\an1}Well, don't you think it'd be
kind of awkward for Kelly

15:13.412 --> 15:15.706
{\an1}to go over there with Brenda
not even talking to her?

15:15.789 --> 15:19.293
Funerals are awkward
for everybody.

15:19.376 --> 15:21.503
{\an1}I mean, aren't you and Dylan
supposed to be going out?

15:21.587 --> 15:23.213
{\an1}Don't you think he
needs you there today?

15:23.297 --> 15:25.341
And I don't understand why you
just didn't tell Serge Menkon,

15:25.424 --> 15:28.302
that today isn't a good day
for you to cut a record.

15:28.385 --> 15:29.928
Donna, I can't
start making demands

15:30.012 --> 15:30.763
before I've proven myself.

15:30.846 --> 15:34.350
Well, what's Dylan
going to think?

15:34.433 --> 15:36.268
Well, if he thinks
about me at all,

15:36.352 --> 15:38.312
which I highly doubt,

15:38.395 --> 15:40.522
maybe he'll appreciate me
leaving him alone.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.274
You know, I am really
disappointed in you--

15:42.358 --> 15:44.276
in both of you.

15:45.277 --> 15:47.488
All right, I'm coming.

15:47.571 --> 15:48.155
{\an3}I just don't
know what to wear.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.717
(knocking)

16:08.801 --> 16:10.636
Yeah. Come in.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.354
You about ready?

16:20.437 --> 16:23.565
Do I have to wear this tie?

16:23.649 --> 16:25.943
Not if you don't want to.

16:26.026 --> 16:27.695
Good.

16:29.446 --> 16:31.907
Shall we go?

16:31.990 --> 16:34.118
If you say so.

16:47.381 --> 16:49.133
{\an1}You threw away all
my stuff, huh?

16:49.216 --> 16:50.759
{\an1}You took down
all the pictures?

16:50.843 --> 16:55.055
{\an3}No, they're just packed away
in a box in the garage.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.766
Out of sight,
out of mind, eh?

16:57.850 --> 17:01.311
Dylan, you've never
been out of my mind.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.358
But if this hadn't happened,
I wouldn't be welcome here.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.449
Dylan... you and Kelly
hurt me pretty badly.

17:16.535 --> 17:18.454
{\an3}But it's nothing compared
to what you're going through.

17:18.537 --> 17:22.290
And in the grand
scheme of things,

17:22.374 --> 17:24.001
{\an3}you'll look back
years from now

17:24.084 --> 17:26.462
and I'll just be a girl
you knew in high school.

17:26.545 --> 17:30.424
No, you won't.

17:30.507 --> 17:32.968
No, you won't, Bren.

17:33.051 --> 17:34.386
Not after everything.

17:39.516 --> 17:42.478
That's nice to know.

17:42.561 --> 17:44.354
We better get going.

17:46.356 --> 17:48.859
Do me a favor, Bren.

17:48.942 --> 17:50.569
Will you help me
tie this thing?

18:15.594 --> 18:17.429
How do we even know that
that's him in there?

18:20.432 --> 18:24.311
I mean, well, that could be
the upholstery

18:24.394 --> 18:27.356
or the steering wheel,
or anything.

18:31.109 --> 18:34.488
Dad, where are you?

18:39.451 --> 18:42.371
They're ready to start.

18:42.454 --> 18:44.373
{\an1}unless you need
a few more minutes?

18:49.294 --> 18:54.132
No, let's get this over with.

18:57.135 --> 19:01.515
They asked if you wanted to say
a few words at the service.

19:01.598 --> 19:04.768
You have some time
to think about it.

19:12.276 --> 19:14.945
(church organ playing)

19:42.848 --> 19:45.559
To everything there is a season,

19:45.642 --> 19:47.519
and a time for every purpose
unto the heaven,

19:47.603 --> 19:51.523
{\an3}a time to be born,
a time to die,

19:51.607 --> 19:57.446
a time to plant, a time to pluck
up what has been planted,

19:57.529 --> 19:58.947
a time to cast away stones

19:59.031 --> 20:01.325
and a time to gather

20:01.408 --> 20:03.660
stones together,

20:03.744 --> 20:05.454
a time to embrace

20:05.537 --> 20:09.291
and a time to refrain
from from embracing.

20:09.374 --> 20:11.543
{\an3}What can you say about
a man who had everything

20:11.627 --> 20:16.340
and lost it?

20:16.423 --> 20:19.468
{\an3}About a man who may not have
realized what he had?

20:19.551 --> 20:20.510
Was he blind or...

20:20.594 --> 20:22.554
What is he gonna say, huh?

20:22.638 --> 20:25.807
{\an3}Is he gonna say that
he was a wise man,

20:25.891 --> 20:28.435
that he was a kind man?
That he had ideas, vision?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.771
And what are you gonna tell 'em?

20:30.854 --> 20:33.315
Are you gonna tell 'em
what a great father he was?

20:33.398 --> 20:34.483
Devoted husband?

20:34.566 --> 20:36.693
Model citizen?

20:36.777 --> 20:39.154
Are you gonna tell them
that they killed him,

20:39.237 --> 20:40.656
but he didn't really
deserve to die?

20:40.739 --> 20:44.493
{\an3}Come on.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.371
{\an3}Dylan, how do
you feel?

20:47.454 --> 20:49.164
Do you want to
say anything?

20:49.247 --> 20:50.916
{\an3}DYLAN:
Huh?

20:50.999 --> 20:52.876
Because the truth is,

20:52.960 --> 20:55.587
they whacked him because
he was a bad guy.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.464
So if you want to share that
with all these people here,

20:57.547 --> 20:59.925
then you be my guest.

21:04.554 --> 21:07.474
No, I don't.

21:13.772 --> 21:15.524
{\an3}(sniffling)

21:22.614 --> 21:26.368
Well, I guess he's not gonna be
coming out anytime soon, huh?

21:26.451 --> 21:28.537
Well, you know, he's not
very big on crowds.

21:28.620 --> 21:31.873
He probably just wants
to be alone right now.

21:31.957 --> 21:32.708
{\an3}Are you sure
we should come over?

21:32.791 --> 21:35.544
Oh, yeah, yeah,
yeah, he'll be okay.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.630
My mom's putting out
a big spread.

21:40.966 --> 21:44.344
Donna, can't you just
say good-bye for me?

21:44.428 --> 21:48.724
No.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.019
Oh, I hate good-byes.

21:52.102 --> 21:54.187
{\an1}Well, I guess this
is good-bye for us too.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.274
{\an3}Yeah, but I'll see you back
at the Walshes'.

21:57.357 --> 22:00.068
I think I'm gonna skip it.

22:00.152 --> 22:01.611
Why?

22:01.695 --> 22:02.571
I just don't want to intrude.

22:02.654 --> 22:06.408
Excuse me, Christine,

22:06.491 --> 22:09.411
{\an1}uh, my mom wanted me to make
sure you have our address.

22:09.494 --> 22:11.246
{\an3}Yes, I do,
thank you very much.

22:11.329 --> 22:16.251
{\an1}And, Kelly, you remember
how to get there, don't you?

22:16.334 --> 22:18.462
I think I can find it.

22:20.547 --> 22:23.258
He'll just be a few minutes.

22:24.551 --> 22:27.763
Is everything
all right?

22:27.846 --> 22:29.890
He had to go to the bathroom.

22:33.018 --> 22:34.561
{\an1}Dylan!

22:49.534 --> 22:50.786
{\an1}I don't know
if you remember me.

22:50.869 --> 22:52.579
{\an1}I worked for Terry Wilson
on the boat.

22:52.662 --> 22:56.500
Yeah. Yeah.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.626
Just wanted to tell you
how sorry I am

22:57.709 --> 23:00.295
about what happened and all.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.964
Thanks.

23:03.048 --> 23:03.548
Excuse me.

23:18.730 --> 23:21.191
You're going to get a phone call

23:21.274 --> 23:23.193
at your friend's house
in two hours

23:23.276 --> 23:25.987
from some people
who need to speak with you.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.823
What are you talking about?

23:27.906 --> 23:29.616
{\an3}They just want to
pay their respects.

23:29.699 --> 23:34.329
{\an3}Be smart, and do
what they tell you.

23:34.413 --> 23:35.872
{\an3}Hey, Dylan.

23:35.956 --> 23:37.541
{\an3}Sorry. I didn't mean
to bother you.

23:37.624 --> 23:40.001
Don't worry, son.

23:40.085 --> 23:42.087
These things have a way
of working themselves out.

23:45.924 --> 23:48.051
{\an3}Listen, man,
I'd really like

23:48.135 --> 23:48.635
{\an3}to be at Brandon's
afterwards with everyone,

23:48.718 --> 23:50.887
but you see, the fact is

23:50.971 --> 23:52.681
I have a recording session
I have to be at, like, now.

23:52.764 --> 23:54.641
Whatever.

24:09.990 --> 24:12.534
DYLAN:
<i>Thanks for coming, Nat.</i>

24:12.617 --> 24:13.910
Bye, Nat.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.537
{\an3}Bye, honey.

24:18.790 --> 24:21.543
Can I get you anything?

24:21.626 --> 24:23.628
No. Not right now. Thanks.

24:26.882 --> 24:30.927
{\an1}Yo, D, want to go shoot
some hoops, brother?

24:31.011 --> 24:32.554
{\an3}No.

24:32.637 --> 24:34.222
Come on, man. A little Horse,
a little Pig.

24:34.306 --> 24:35.932
No. Maybe later.

24:36.016 --> 24:36.766
See you out there.

24:41.563 --> 24:43.023
You guys going to shoot around?

24:43.106 --> 24:45.233
{\an1}Yeah. Your son thinks
he can school me, so...

24:45.317 --> 24:47.235
Why don't you ask Dylan
if he'll play?

24:47.319 --> 24:49.237
He's not into it, Dad.

24:49.321 --> 24:51.281
Let me work on him.

24:51.364 --> 24:52.699
{\an3}Brandon, can I talk
to you for a sec?

24:52.782 --> 24:56.036
Sure. What's up?

24:56.119 --> 24:57.746
I'm worried about Dylan.

24:57.829 --> 25:00.540
Well, Brenda,
you can't exactly expect him

25:00.624 --> 25:01.791
to be the life of the party.

25:01.875 --> 25:03.418
But that article in the paper

25:03.501 --> 25:04.044
made it sound like
<i>he</i> might be the next target.

25:04.127 --> 25:06.421
And that's why we decided

25:06.504 --> 25:08.465
not to discuss it with him,
remember?

25:08.548 --> 25:11.009
Brandon,
from the way he's talking,

25:11.092 --> 25:12.761
something tells me
he already knows.

25:17.974 --> 25:19.935
These chips are so salty.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.728
{\an1}Then why don't
you stop eating them?

25:21.811 --> 25:23.271
I can't. I'm so nervous.

25:23.355 --> 25:24.439
{\an1}What are you
nervous about?

25:24.522 --> 25:26.441
This house.

25:26.524 --> 25:28.652
Dylan and Brenda
under the same roof together.

25:28.735 --> 25:32.447
Oh, please. Come on.

25:32.530 --> 25:33.740
I can't help it.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.617
{\an3}I mean, it's
like I'm paralyzed.

25:35.700 --> 25:36.785
{\an3}I don't even know
what to say to him.

25:36.868 --> 25:40.247
{\an3}I feel like he's
totally ignoring me.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.375
{\an1}Well, that's 'cause
you're acting really weird.

25:43.458 --> 25:45.877
{\an1}Thank you.
You're welcome.

25:53.677 --> 25:54.886
{\an6}ANDREA:
How long does it
take freesia to bloom?

25:54.970 --> 25:58.139
In Southern California?
Not more than about ten weeks.

25:58.223 --> 25:58.765
Cindy has quite a green thumb.

25:58.848 --> 26:00.976
Well, would you like

26:01.059 --> 26:01.810
to go sit out
on the patio?

26:01.893 --> 26:03.770
{\an3}Sure.

26:03.853 --> 26:05.146
What about you, Dylan?

26:09.818 --> 26:12.153
Uh... I was just wondering.

26:12.237 --> 26:14.531
When are we going
to be going down the the studio?

26:14.614 --> 26:18.326
Well, the group
ahead of you, uh...

26:18.410 --> 26:19.661
they have one more track to lay.

26:19.744 --> 26:21.037
What? Maybe another

26:21.121 --> 26:22.497
{\an1}hour, huh?

26:22.580 --> 26:23.498
An hour?

26:23.581 --> 26:27.043
Why? You have someplace
you'd rather be?

26:28.420 --> 26:31.506
No. Well, sort of.

26:31.589 --> 26:33.675
You see, my friend's father,
he just got...

26:33.758 --> 26:38.471
Uh... he died and, uh...
they're having the reception

26:38.555 --> 26:39.848
right now.
Oh, David.

26:39.931 --> 26:41.766
Why didn't
you say anything to us?

26:41.850 --> 26:43.893
{\an1}Serge booked
the space.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.855
We have people coming in.

26:46.938 --> 26:50.191
I know. It was just
sort of a last-minute death.

26:50.275 --> 26:51.484
{\an1}I mean...
David,

26:51.568 --> 26:54.404
a word to the wise.

26:54.487 --> 26:55.697
You want a career
in this business,

26:55.780 --> 26:58.908
you got to get
a creative synergy going.

26:58.992 --> 27:01.661
You know, that's a give-and-take
kind of thing.

27:01.745 --> 27:04.497
I hip, you hop. You be, I bop.

27:04.581 --> 27:06.333
{\an1}You know
what I'm saying?

27:06.416 --> 27:08.752
Uh... not really.

27:08.835 --> 27:12.297
Don't worry. You will.

27:15.633 --> 27:16.551
Okay, this is it.

27:16.634 --> 27:17.761
{\an1}This is for the title,
this is for

27:17.844 --> 27:20.555
{\an1}the money, this is for
everything folks. If I...

27:20.638 --> 27:21.890
If I make this shot in,

27:21.973 --> 27:24.225
you'll have to kiss my feet
in a conga line.

27:24.309 --> 27:25.560
Is he always like this?

27:25.643 --> 27:27.979
{\an1}Yeah. Shoot the ball
already, would ya, Steve?

27:28.063 --> 27:29.647
{\an4}Wait a second.
I want to know
if there's any takers.

27:29.731 --> 27:30.857
Yeah, I got a taker for you.

27:30.940 --> 27:32.817
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

27:32.901 --> 27:33.777
Shoot!

27:33.860 --> 27:35.779
{\an1}Oh! Two points!
All right!

27:35.862 --> 27:39.574
{\an3}You know they're not
your friends, don't you?

27:39.657 --> 27:42.744
{\an3}I mean, Brandon--
he's the one they love.

27:42.827 --> 27:44.913
{\an3}Oh, and like you and
Donna Martin have

27:44.996 --> 27:48.917
{\an3}anything in common...
except Kelly.

27:49.000 --> 27:51.127
{\an3}Sure, she's
good looking,

27:51.211 --> 27:52.921
but you know
it's only a matter of time

27:53.004 --> 27:54.089
before she burns you, too.

27:54.172 --> 27:55.757
{\an3}Shoot!

27:55.840 --> 27:56.925
Ooh, it disappeared.

27:57.008 --> 27:58.760
(Andrea laughs)

27:58.843 --> 28:00.804
Your shot, buddy.

28:00.887 --> 28:02.639
Go ahead.

28:12.816 --> 28:15.443
{\an3}Hi.

28:15.527 --> 28:17.153
Hi.

28:17.237 --> 28:19.114
{\an3}It's kind of weird being
here, don't you think?

28:19.197 --> 28:20.949
I think it's all relative.

28:21.032 --> 28:21.991
{\an1}It was weird being
in that limo with Jack,

28:22.075 --> 28:26.621
it was weird at the hotel,
it was weird on that boat.

28:26.704 --> 28:27.497
My whole life has been weird.

28:27.580 --> 28:29.833
Well, I really-- I
really liked Jack

28:29.916 --> 28:32.627
even though I didn't
know him that well.

28:32.710 --> 28:34.796
{\an1}Kelly, you knew him
nearly as well as I did.

28:34.879 --> 28:37.465
And I didn't believe anything

28:37.549 --> 28:37.966
that they wrote in
that article today.

28:38.049 --> 28:39.801
What article?

28:39.884 --> 28:43.596
The, the one in
the newspaper.

28:43.680 --> 28:46.599
{\an1}Hey, Brandon,
you got today's newspaper?

28:46.683 --> 28:49.310
No, I think I threw it away.

28:49.394 --> 28:51.312
So what'd it say, this article?

28:51.396 --> 28:52.981
{\an1}He was a mobster
or just a liar and a cheat?

28:53.064 --> 28:54.983
Dylan, I'm sorry.

28:55.066 --> 28:58.194
Why? Did you write it?

29:26.764 --> 29:28.516
{\an1}Hey, what's up,
Dylan?

29:28.600 --> 29:29.684
Oh, not now,

29:29.767 --> 29:31.519
goofball!

29:31.603 --> 29:32.353
Listen,
everybody's out back, David.

29:32.437 --> 29:33.855
I'll be there in a minute.

29:35.899 --> 29:38.359
So what are you doing, man?

29:38.443 --> 29:39.360
We're about to get drunk.

29:39.444 --> 29:40.570
You want to join us?
Hey,

29:40.653 --> 29:42.155
{\an3}didn't you have something
that you had to do?

29:42.238 --> 29:44.491
{\an1}Yeah, well, I got 'em
to postpone the session

29:44.574 --> 29:46.034
{\an1}'cause my head wasn't
really into it.

29:46.117 --> 29:47.994
Well, I hope you didn't
do that on my account.

29:48.077 --> 29:49.829
Especially since you
and I have nothing

29:49.913 --> 29:50.747
to say to one another.

29:50.830 --> 29:53.249
{\an1}Listen, we've never
really been too close...

29:53.333 --> 29:54.584
Here it comes.

29:54.667 --> 29:57.378
"I've always liked you,
I've always respected you."

29:57.462 --> 30:00.381
...and I guess
the fact is, uh,

30:00.465 --> 30:02.258
you just don't
really like me too much.

30:02.342 --> 30:04.594
David, the fact is I don't
really know you that well.

30:04.677 --> 30:05.887
Yeah, well, that's just it.

30:05.970 --> 30:08.348
I suddenly feel like
I know you more than anybody.

30:08.431 --> 30:10.391
Would you get rid
of this yutz, huh?

30:10.475 --> 30:11.059
{\an1}Listen, man,
it wasn't my father,

30:11.142 --> 30:13.728
but I was in the room

30:13.811 --> 30:16.397
when Scott accidentally blew
himself away

30:16.481 --> 30:17.941
{\an1}and I know how I felt
afterwards.

30:18.024 --> 30:22.278
{\an1}It's like a bad nightmare
you can't really wake up from

30:22.362 --> 30:24.405
and you can't do anything
to get him back.

30:24.489 --> 30:27.200
{\an1}I wanted to run away
and get high or something,

30:27.283 --> 30:28.201
but the problem is

30:28.284 --> 30:32.163
you can't run away
from what's in your head.

30:40.213 --> 30:42.966
I know.

30:43.049 --> 30:45.552
I know.

30:45.635 --> 30:47.971
{\an3}You want to go
outside, get some air?

31:01.526 --> 31:03.820
Oh, hi, David.

31:03.903 --> 31:04.779
Hi, Mrs. Walsh.

31:04.862 --> 31:07.615
{\an1}Dylan, have you had
anything at all to eat?

31:07.699 --> 31:09.075
Now that you mention it, no.

31:09.158 --> 31:11.077
What's good?

31:11.160 --> 31:12.120
Ah, this.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.371
(phone rings)
This is very good.

31:13.454 --> 31:14.497
Ooh.

31:14.581 --> 31:15.498
Try the salmon.

31:15.582 --> 31:16.666
{\an1}DAVID:
Thank you.

31:16.749 --> 31:17.709
Dylan.

31:17.792 --> 31:19.294
{\an3}The phone's for
you; it's...

31:19.377 --> 31:20.920
your Uncle Frank?

31:28.553 --> 31:30.305
Thank you very much, Mrs. Walsh.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.473
{\an3}DYLAN:
Are you threatening me?

31:32.557 --> 31:34.475
{\an3}Is that what
this is about?

31:34.559 --> 31:36.269
{\an3}All right, l-look,
I'll be there.

31:36.352 --> 31:38.271
Yeah, y-you got
to be more specific.

31:38.354 --> 31:39.105
(dial tone)

31:40.106 --> 31:43.026
Dylan, look.

31:43.109 --> 31:44.819
{\an3}Kelly, is Brandon
still outside?

31:44.902 --> 31:45.778
{\an3}Yes.
Thanks.

31:45.862 --> 31:46.779
Dylan, wait a minute.

31:46.863 --> 31:48.156
I need to talk to you.

31:48.239 --> 31:49.949
{\an3}Look, I'm really
bad at this.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.492
Nothing I say is
coming out right,

31:51.576 --> 31:52.493
{\an3}so maybe I
should just go.

31:52.577 --> 31:53.494
Do what you got to do.

31:53.578 --> 31:54.579
{\an3}I was hoping you'd say
you'd come with me.

31:54.662 --> 31:55.538
Kelly, I can't.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.539
All right?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.833
(sighs)

31:58.916 --> 31:59.876
Oh, God.

31:59.959 --> 32:02.754
I'll call you later.

32:04.797 --> 32:08.051
(sighs)

32:09.302 --> 32:12.639
{\an3}Brandon, Brandon,
listen to me.

32:12.722 --> 32:14.515
I need a favor.

32:16.559 --> 32:18.686
Oh, Dylan!
Hey! Hey!

32:18.770 --> 32:19.979
There he is!
Dylan, over here!

32:20.063 --> 32:21.147
{\an3}Let's go.

32:42.835 --> 32:44.712
Thanks, man.

32:44.796 --> 32:46.047
You got it.

32:46.130 --> 32:47.674
{\an3}You want to tell me
what this is all about?

32:47.757 --> 32:49.842
{\an1}If all goes well, I'll find
out what I need to know.

32:49.926 --> 32:51.219
And what if all
doesn't go well?

32:51.302 --> 32:53.096
Say you knew me when.

32:53.346 --> 32:56.391
{\an3}I'm coming
with you, man.

32:56.474 --> 32:57.392
{\an3}Next time.
Hey,

32:57.475 --> 32:58.726
what am I supposed to tell 'em

32:58.810 --> 33:00.061
if they ask me
what's going on, huh?

33:00.144 --> 33:01.229
(car engine starts)

33:01.312 --> 33:03.064
Make something up.

33:03.147 --> 33:05.858
(tires screeching,
engine roaring)

33:32.343 --> 33:36.139
{\an1}So what are we trying
to prove here, huh?

33:36.222 --> 33:37.390
{\an1}That we're
as stupid as Jack?

33:37.473 --> 33:38.474
I mean, come on, man,

33:38.558 --> 33:40.393
{\an1}those people put a bomb
under his car.

33:40.476 --> 33:42.478
What do you think they're going
to do when they find us?

33:42.562 --> 33:43.980
Two in the bonnet
and watch us bleed.

33:44.063 --> 33:45.148
Look, will you shut up?!

33:46.315 --> 33:48.943
{\an3}Thank you.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.280
You know, we could be to Baja

33:52.363 --> 33:55.158
in two hours.

34:00.538 --> 34:03.291
I just don't want to die.

34:05.334 --> 34:08.337
(mariachi music playing)

34:29.442 --> 34:31.319
(cash register rings)
(coins clatter)

34:31.402 --> 34:33.321
(men shouting)

34:53.257 --> 34:54.342
Daddy!

34:58.429 --> 35:01.182
Glad you could make it.

35:01.265 --> 35:03.309
Do you want to, uh, follow me?
Who are you?

35:03.392 --> 35:05.353
We'll get to that later.
(mock chuckling)

35:05.436 --> 35:08.397
We'll get to that right here,
right now, in broad daylight

35:08.481 --> 35:10.441
{\an3}with all these people
around-- now, who are you?

35:40.471 --> 35:42.431
(water dripping)

35:51.232 --> 35:53.192
Thanks for coming, Dylan.

35:53.276 --> 35:55.361
{\an1}Sorry to pull you away
from your friends.

35:55.444 --> 35:58.406
If you work for the government,
why are we meeting here?

35:58.489 --> 36:01.909
Because we're <i> not</i> meeting here.

36:01.993 --> 36:04.912
In fact, this conversation
never took place.

36:05.955 --> 36:06.873
So, what is it?

36:06.956 --> 36:10.293
You want to ask me
about my dad's "mob ties"?

36:10.376 --> 36:12.295
{\an3}Is that it?

36:12.378 --> 36:15.298
Let me tell you, you picked
a damn bad day for it.

36:15.381 --> 36:17.633
{\an3}CHRISTINE:
No, Dylan.

36:21.554 --> 36:22.471
That's not it.

36:22.555 --> 36:26.392
What, they dragged
you down here, too?

36:26.475 --> 36:27.476
Not exactly.

36:29.520 --> 36:32.023
I work with these guys.

36:35.192 --> 36:37.194
So did your father.

36:41.866 --> 36:44.118
{\an1}BORMAN:
When your dad agreed

36:44.201 --> 36:45.995
to cooperate with us,

36:46.078 --> 36:47.997
he had only one condition:

36:48.080 --> 36:50.082
that if anything
happened to him,

36:50.166 --> 36:54.253
{\an3}you should at least be told
that he was on the right side.

36:55.338 --> 36:57.465
I don't get it, at all.

36:57.548 --> 37:00.968
I mean, what, he got
out of prison early

37:01.052 --> 37:03.971
{\an1}so he could help you people
set up a sting operation?

37:04.055 --> 37:05.640
A-Acting as the bait

37:05.723 --> 37:07.975
{\an1}to lure some crime boss
to the boat?

37:08.059 --> 37:09.185
That was the plan.

37:09.268 --> 37:10.478
{\an1}Well, my question is:
While you geniuses

37:10.561 --> 37:14.023
{\an1}were supposed to be
watching his every move,

37:14.106 --> 37:15.441
how did they get the bomb

37:15.524 --> 37:18.277
under his car?!

37:18.361 --> 37:19.028
I mean, this is sick.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.113
{\an1}He went undercover
for you people,

37:21.197 --> 37:23.491
{\an1}he spilled his guts out,
and you were so busy

37:23.574 --> 37:26.035
{\an1}covering your ass that
you let your star witness

37:26.118 --> 37:30.373
{\an5}fall through the cracks,
and it cost him his life!
All right!

37:30.456 --> 37:32.333
It was a major screw-up, okay?

37:32.416 --> 37:36.045
{\an3}But this is an ongoing
investigation.

37:36.128 --> 37:38.381
{\an3}There's a lot of people
out on a limb here,

37:38.464 --> 37:40.341
and the only reason you're
getting this information--

37:40.424 --> 37:43.219
which you're not
getting, remember--

37:43.302 --> 37:45.596
is because your
father cut a deal.

37:48.599 --> 37:51.852
Can I talk to you
alone for a minute?

38:02.655 --> 38:04.323
{\an1}So, when you agreed
to marry Jack,

38:04.407 --> 38:05.700
was that just part
of the game, too?

38:05.783 --> 38:06.784
No, it wasn't.

38:06.867 --> 38:09.036
I mean, they do have rules
about that kind of thing?

38:09.120 --> 38:11.372
{\an5}Fraternizing with
the informants?
Yes, they do.

38:11.455 --> 38:15.209
{\an3}That's why I was
gonna resign.

38:17.253 --> 38:21.215
{\an3}Sometimes we fall in love
with the wrong people, Dylan.

38:21.298 --> 38:25.219
{\an5}(wry chuckle):
So you don't have
to resign now.

38:25.302 --> 38:30.391
{\an3}No, but I got to find a
way to go on without him.

38:31.600 --> 38:34.645
{\an3}That's what you've
got to do, too, Dylan.

38:40.317 --> 38:43.362
(mariachi music playing)

38:51.662 --> 38:55.082
{\an1}You don't really believe
that fairy tale

38:55.166 --> 38:57.626
about Jack being
a big unsung hero, do you?

38:57.710 --> 39:00.212
{\an3}I am not gonna sit here
talking to myself.

39:00.296 --> 39:02.923
{\an4}Yeah, that's just it,
you're not gonna be
talking to anybody

39:03.007 --> 39:06.427
{\an5}when the guy who put
the bomb under Jack's car
comes to our house!

39:06.510 --> 39:09.597
{\an5}(music blasting over radio)
Do you really trust
those goons to protect us?

39:09.680 --> 39:11.390
Oh yeah, hey,
turn up the volume,

39:11.474 --> 39:13.267
that's fine with me,
but I'm not gonna shut up

39:13.350 --> 39:15.478
until you go to a liquor store
and we get plastered.

39:15.561 --> 39:18.230
(turns off radio)
No! I don't want to hear it.

39:18.314 --> 39:22.777
{\an3}This is not the Bel Age Hotel!
It's not Rio or Paris!

39:22.860 --> 39:24.487
I'm not 13 years old anymore!

39:24.570 --> 39:26.405
I'll be damned
if I'm gonna listen

39:26.489 --> 39:28.991
to a broken record
for the rest of my life.

39:29.075 --> 39:30.534
Okay, here it comes,
once and for all, all right?

39:30.618 --> 39:34.789
We are gonna get through this,
and I do not want a drink!

♪ ♪

40:07.238 --> 40:08.948
You guys still here?

40:09.031 --> 40:10.991
I figured I'd be
old news by now.

40:11.075 --> 40:13.160
{\an6}Hardly. The <i> Herald</i>
is running a major
story tomorrow.

40:13.244 --> 40:14.620
{\an1}It's a good thing
I don't get the <i> Herald.</i>

40:14.703 --> 40:17.248
Dylan, we understand
there was bad blood

40:17.331 --> 40:18.499
between you and your father.

40:18.582 --> 40:20.626
{\an3}What kind of man was he,
and how will you remember him?

40:20.709 --> 40:24.630
I'm glad
you asked me that.

40:24.713 --> 40:26.924
I had a chance to talk
about him today

40:27.007 --> 40:28.676
at his funeral
and, uh, I didn't.

40:28.759 --> 40:32.012
{\an1}(sighs):
So, wh...

40:32.096 --> 40:34.306
when you write
about the notorious Jack McKay,

40:34.390 --> 40:36.058
you write this:

40:36.142 --> 40:39.353
He is survived by his only son,

40:39.436 --> 40:43.190
who loved him very much...

40:43.274 --> 40:47.027
and will miss him very much.

40:48.821 --> 40:49.780
Thanks, Dylan.

40:49.864 --> 40:52.241
{\an3}Let's go.

40:53.117 --> 40:55.202
We were getting worried
about you.

40:55.286 --> 41:00.249
{\an6}(sighs):
I just had to take a
drive to clear my head.

41:00.332 --> 41:01.542
Did it help?

41:01.625 --> 41:02.668
Yeah.

41:02.751 --> 41:03.878
Yeah, it did.

41:03.961 --> 41:05.379
(chuckles):
I, uh...

41:05.462 --> 41:07.381
I started flashing
back to this summer

41:07.464 --> 41:10.384
{\an3}a long time ago at
the beach, where, uh,

41:10.467 --> 41:13.804
{\an3}he taught me how to body surf,
taught me how to read.

41:13.888 --> 41:15.723
I'd forgotten all that.

41:15.806 --> 41:20.227
At least you got to hear
your father tell you...

41:20.311 --> 41:23.397
how much he loved you.

41:23.480 --> 41:26.275
Yeah.

41:26.358 --> 41:27.943
He did.

41:31.822 --> 41:34.241
Come on inside.

41:39.163 --> 41:40.998
Hi.

41:42.374 --> 41:44.084
Hi.

41:44.168 --> 41:45.753
You want some?

(exhales):
What flavor?

41:50.299 --> 41:52.968
Mm, butter pecan.

41:53.052 --> 41:55.054
Always works for me.

No, it's okay.

Okay.
