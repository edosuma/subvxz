00:41.650 --> 00:43.920
I'm lost.
Please, can you help me?

00:43.920 --> 00:46.360
It's that way.

00:49.290 --> 00:51.330
- Those trees...
- Are you the doctor?

00:51.330 --> 00:54.730
- Are you the doctor?
- Yes.

00:54.730 --> 00:59.900
Do you have an appointment?
You need an appointment
to see the doctor.

01:00.170 --> 01:03.370
Please,
something's chasing me.

01:08.650 --> 01:10.350
[gasping]

01:10.350 --> 01:12.720
When you drink a glass of coke,
it's only this big.

01:12.720 --> 01:15.280
But it's actually got
this much sugar in it.

01:15.290 --> 01:17.790
- Works a bit like that.
- What does?

01:17.790 --> 01:18.850
The tardis.

01:18.860 --> 01:22.430
It's bigger on the inside
than the outside.

01:22.430 --> 01:23.560
Or did you not notice?

01:23.560 --> 01:24.790
I just thought
it was supposed to be

01:24.800 --> 01:27.430
Bigger on the inside,
so I didn't say anything.

01:27.430 --> 01:30.170
Well, of course,
it's supposed to be bigger.

01:30.170 --> 01:32.400
Most people
are confused by that.

01:32.400 --> 01:34.370
I find everything
confusing really,

01:34.370 --> 01:37.810
So I don't say anything.
That's how come
I'm in the woods.

01:37.810 --> 01:39.880
I thought miss oswald told me
to find the doctor,

01:39.880 --> 01:42.610
But it wasn't her,
it was just in my head.

01:42.610 --> 01:45.850
Miss oswald? Dark hair?
Highly unpredictable?

01:45.850 --> 01:47.350
Surprisingly round face?

01:47.350 --> 01:49.850
Everyone says she's
in love with mr pink.

01:49.850 --> 01:52.290
- The pe teacher.
- Maths.

01:52.290 --> 01:54.790
I really like him.
I was in his group.

01:54.790 --> 01:58.160
Mr pink was looking after you?
Well, that explains
why you're lost.

01:58.160 --> 02:00.260
It doesn't surprise you
that I know all
about your school?

02:00.260 --> 02:03.830
Everyone seems to know
everything about everything,
apart from me.

02:03.840 --> 02:07.900
That's not quite true.
I, for instance,
have no idea why,

02:07.910 --> 02:09.340
When the terrestrial
navigation...

02:09.340 --> 02:11.370
...The terrestrial
navigation starts up,

02:11.380 --> 02:13.840
It closes down
all the other systems.

02:13.850 --> 02:15.280
You should ask
somebody who knows.

02:15.280 --> 02:18.880
Hm, that's another
of the drawbacks of being
the last of your species:

02:18.880 --> 02:22.180
No one to ask
when your tardis won't start.

02:22.190 --> 02:24.220
[whirring]

02:24.220 --> 02:28.160
- <i>[female voice] you have</i>
<i>reached your destination.</i>
<i>- No, we haven't!</i>

02:28.160 --> 02:29.530
We're supposed to be
in the middle of london.

02:29.530 --> 02:31.290
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>your destination.</i>

02:31.300 --> 02:32.900
Oh, stop saying that!

02:32.900 --> 02:36.100
She's only saying it
because it's true.

02:36.100 --> 02:38.730
We are in
the middle of london.

02:38.740 --> 02:41.040
We are in the middle
of a forest.

02:41.040 --> 02:43.340
Come and see.

02:43.710 --> 02:47.710
- Nelson's column.
Do you like it?
- Do I... Sorry, what?

02:47.710 --> 02:53.020
Do you like the forest
being in trafalgar square?
I think it's lovely.

04:11.260 --> 04:12.660
Bradley! Sir!

04:12.660 --> 04:14.060
Tell him, sir,
he's blinding me!

04:14.070 --> 04:16.670
- Give me that, bradley.
- I'm allowed a torch, sir.

04:16.670 --> 04:19.300
I've got a note,
I'm darkness-phobic.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.540
Just 'cause he's
scared of the dark, sir,

04:20.540 --> 04:22.440
Does that mean
he's allowed to blind me?

04:22.440 --> 04:23.940
You're allowed
a torch, bradley,

04:23.940 --> 04:25.140
Not a pocket-supernova.

04:25.140 --> 04:28.380
Ok, listen up.
Just a few things to run through
before we head home.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.550
Put your phone away, bradley.
Thank you.

04:30.550 --> 04:33.250
Firstly, collect up any rubbish
you may have generated

04:33.250 --> 04:35.920
Through midnight feasts
or whatever.

04:37.150 --> 04:38.850
Hello?!

04:41.830 --> 04:43.960
Hello?

04:46.960 --> 04:48.260
[girl] look at this.

04:48.270 --> 04:51.570
Why is this one so fat, miss?

04:51.570 --> 04:53.300
Because it was alive so long.

04:53.300 --> 04:56.810
[girl] this ring, though.
All the other rings are thin.

04:56.810 --> 05:01.210
This one's fat and red. See?

05:01.210 --> 05:04.950
Must have been
a good year to be a tree.

05:05.950 --> 05:08.320
I should have been
relieved, you know.

05:08.320 --> 05:12.450
- Oh. Coal hill school,
sleepover.
- Shh!

05:20.830 --> 05:23.900
[beeping]

05:24.470 --> 05:25.800
[all sigh heavily]

05:25.800 --> 05:28.770
[beeping continues]

05:28.770 --> 05:31.410
[door unlocks, beeps]

05:34.010 --> 05:35.680
Hang on, there's
a knack to this.

05:35.680 --> 05:37.780
No, no, no, no, no.
It moved, it moved.

05:37.780 --> 05:40.980
It's just jammed, it's
not locked. Come on, team.

05:40.990 --> 05:42.950
What team?

05:49.760 --> 05:51.630
Wow. Sir, where are we?

05:51.630 --> 05:54.060
What do you mean,
"where are we"?

05:55.330 --> 05:59.870
We can't have been asleep
for that long, can we?

06:18.220 --> 06:20.220
<i>You've heard of</i>
<i>leaves on the line,</i>

06:20.220 --> 06:23.960
<i>This is going to be</i>
<i>slightly harder to clear.</i>

06:23.960 --> 06:25.760
<i>In three hours time,</i>
<i>the ghana black stars</i>

06:25.760 --> 06:28.930
<i>Are due to play sierra leone</i>
<i>in the africa cup of nations...</i>

06:28.930 --> 06:31.770
<i>[speaking foreign language]</i>

06:32.800 --> 06:36.540
<i>It does not look like</i>
<i>the pitch will be ready.</i>

06:36.710 --> 06:39.110
You're always showing me
amazing things, well, I, doctor,

06:39.110 --> 06:42.210
Have finally got something
amazing to show you.

06:42.210 --> 06:44.480
Yes, well, there are some things
that I've never seen.

06:44.480 --> 06:46.520
That's usually because
I've chosen not to see them.

06:46.520 --> 06:49.990
Even my incredibly long life
is too short for <i>les miserables.</i>

06:49.990 --> 06:52.390
Oh, doctor,
you are gonna love this.

06:52.390 --> 06:57.430
<i>[the doctor] well, when you</i>
<i>come to collect this child,</i>
<i>you can tell me then.</i>

06:57.430 --> 06:59.090
Huh? What child?

06:59.100 --> 07:02.160
Young female human. Standard
defenceless little girl.

07:02.170 --> 07:05.330
Your friend mr pink was supposed
to be looking after her.

07:05.340 --> 07:09.810
- She probably has a name.
- Good point.

07:09.810 --> 07:12.940
[the doctor] you.
Have you got a name at all?

07:12.940 --> 07:14.410
Maebh. My name's maebh.

07:14.410 --> 07:16.810
What? Maebh?
Where are you?

07:16.810 --> 07:20.380
Trafalgar square.
I found her wandering around
the brand-new forest.

07:20.380 --> 07:25.850
- Brand-new forest?
- Yes, it's like the new forest,
except even newer.

07:25.860 --> 07:27.290
Is that the forest
that's covering london?

07:27.290 --> 07:29.930
<i>[the doctor] was that the</i>
<i>amazing thing you</i>
<i>were gonna show me?</i>

07:29.930 --> 07:31.560
'tis amazing
that I saw it first.

07:31.560 --> 07:35.300
Look, is she all right?
Will you bring her over?

07:35.300 --> 07:38.300
I can't bring her over, I'm a
time lord, not a child minder.

07:38.300 --> 07:41.340
You've got a spaceship.
All we've got are oyster cards.

07:41.340 --> 07:47.640
And I've got a global rapid
forestation crisis to deal with.

07:50.780 --> 07:52.680
- What did they say?
- Who?

07:52.680 --> 07:54.620
School, parents...
You were just on the phone.

07:54.620 --> 07:57.690
Oh, yeah, rang school
and parents. Yes, of course.

07:57.690 --> 07:59.620
I thought that was a priority.

07:59.620 --> 08:02.290
- And?
- And... I couldn't get through.

08:02.290 --> 08:03.490
Left messages,
I'll try again.

08:03.490 --> 08:05.290
Ah, you didn't call the school,
you called him.

08:05.300 --> 08:09.870
No, he called me, actually.
I can't stop him calling me,
can I?

08:09.870 --> 08:12.300
I thought you weren't
in contact.

08:12.500 --> 08:15.500
London has just been taken over
by a gigantic forest,

08:15.510 --> 08:17.040
Who do you want to talk to,
monty don?

08:17.040 --> 08:19.640
I want to do my job, which
is looking after these kids.

08:19.640 --> 08:22.340
- Oh, really? How many kids?
- What?

08:22.350 --> 08:24.710
Where's maebh arden?

08:25.180 --> 08:26.420
She's with the doctor.

08:26.420 --> 08:29.280
What? No, no, no,
maebh is a vulnerable kid,

08:29.290 --> 08:32.390
She's on medication.
She's having emotional trauma.

08:32.390 --> 08:33.890
He... Has he even been
crb checked?

08:33.890 --> 08:35.990
He didn't abduct her,
she was lost!

08:35.990 --> 08:38.330
- He found her!
- I thought you said
they're in love.

08:38.330 --> 08:40.100
Why are they shouting
at each other?

08:40.100 --> 08:42.730
That's what people do
when they're in love.

08:42.730 --> 08:44.870
Don't you know anything?

08:45.500 --> 08:49.100
[boy] where are we actually
going? Where is he taking us?

08:49.110 --> 08:50.370
[children chattering]

08:50.370 --> 08:52.440
- Who wants to be navigator?
- [all] me, me!

08:52.440 --> 08:54.580
[danny] good lad.
Come on, let's do this.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.540
What's an avigator?

08:55.550 --> 08:58.480
Follow the lamppost, that'll
keep us on cromwell road.

08:58.480 --> 09:00.080
We'll be able to
orientate ourselves.

09:00.080 --> 09:03.620
I thought we were getting
a coach. Where's the coach?

09:03.620 --> 09:07.290
Well, ruby, it seems there are
a lot of trees in the way.

09:07.290 --> 09:09.890
Why can't we just wait here
till they've gone?

09:09.890 --> 09:11.790
Trees don't
just disappear, ruby.

09:11.800 --> 09:14.330
They just came,
why won't they just go?

09:14.330 --> 09:16.870
See the question is:
How did it get here?

09:16.870 --> 09:19.600
Can a forest grow overnight
or have we been asleep for years

09:19.600 --> 09:21.670
- Like sleeping beauty?
- No, the question is:

09:21.670 --> 09:23.410
How are we gonna
get these kids home?

09:23.410 --> 09:26.340
Oh, absolutely, yeah.
That is the big question.

09:26.340 --> 09:29.110
[danny] ok, team,
it's crucial we stick together.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.410
If you start
to fall behind, don't.

09:30.410 --> 09:32.610
Bradley, we're gonna head
northeast first,

09:32.620 --> 09:34.350
To collect maebh
from trafalgar square.

09:34.350 --> 09:37.690
Then we're going south to
the river. Come on, keep up.

09:37.690 --> 09:39.050
[children chattering]

09:39.060 --> 09:41.760
You are enjoying this
just a little bit too much.

09:41.760 --> 09:45.430
Come on. You're not even
a little bit curious

09:45.430 --> 09:48.330
About how, who, why, when?

09:48.330 --> 09:51.100
I am curious,
I'm bewildered,

09:51.100 --> 09:53.370
I am, in fact, enchanted.

09:53.370 --> 09:55.440
But I'm not the priority here,
the kids are.

09:55.440 --> 10:00.180
You see, now that attitude is...
Actually very attractive.

10:00.180 --> 10:04.650
The government emergency
committee, cobra,
has formulated an action plan.

10:04.650 --> 10:08.680
We will create pathways through
the trees using carefully
controlled fires.

10:08.690 --> 10:11.390
This will facilitate the
movement of essential services.

10:11.390 --> 10:14.420
<i>We're therefore asking you</i>
<i>to stay in your homes,</i>

10:14.430 --> 10:18.090
<i>Fill your baths, sinks and</i>
<i>any buckets with fresh water...</i>

10:18.100 --> 10:20.260
Why would there be no reading?

10:20.430 --> 10:21.630
Because they're actually
made of wood.

10:21.630 --> 10:25.670
No circuits,
no mechanism. Wood.

10:26.740 --> 10:29.910
- What's this for?
- This is a sonic screwdriver.

10:29.910 --> 10:32.940
It interacts with
any form of communication
you care to mention.

10:32.940 --> 10:36.850
Sadly, trees have no
moving parts and they
don't communicate.

10:36.850 --> 10:41.020
- They communicate
a bit, though.
- What?

10:41.020 --> 10:43.290
Otherwise they wouldn't all grow
at the same time, would they?

10:43.290 --> 10:47.060
So, what, do you think
that's how spring begins?

10:47.060 --> 10:48.820
With a group message
on tree-facebook?

10:48.830 --> 10:51.330
Do you think they
send texts to each other?

10:51.330 --> 10:53.360
You don't need a phone
to communicate, do you?

10:53.360 --> 10:57.930
I haven't phoned home and I know
my mum is worried about me.

11:02.510 --> 11:03.910
You said you'd collect maebh.

11:03.910 --> 11:09.110
It's all right,
I'm collecting her,
as soon as I find my car keys.

11:09.110 --> 11:11.080
I can't see a thing.

11:11.080 --> 11:14.880
Next door planted
bloody hydrangeas.
Have they gone mental?

11:14.890 --> 11:19.660
I've had words with her
about it before and she's...

11:20.320 --> 11:22.160
Oh...

11:22.160 --> 11:23.490
I'll call you back.

11:23.490 --> 11:26.130
[ruby] miss,
in the museum, right,

11:26.130 --> 11:28.100
I was reading
about reproduction.

11:28.100 --> 11:29.460
Oh, ruby, this really
isn't the right...

11:29.470 --> 11:31.930
It said that trees
have blossoms

11:31.940 --> 11:34.100
And then that turns into fruit
or seeds or nuts, right?

11:34.100 --> 11:39.410
- Right, ruby.
- This tree has got
blossom and nuts.

11:39.410 --> 11:41.780
Oh, yeah, that is strange.

11:41.780 --> 11:44.350
Nuts. That's unfortunate
for you, isn't it, bradley?

11:44.350 --> 11:47.420
You have an allergy, don't you?
What if one of them
falls on your head?

11:47.420 --> 11:50.850
You'd die, you'd swell up
like a massive melon.

11:50.850 --> 11:51.650
Shut it!

11:51.660 --> 11:55.020
We should have
been consulted.

11:55.030 --> 11:56.190
What's it made of even?

11:56.190 --> 12:00.030
[woman] how far does this go?
I need to collect maebh.

12:00.030 --> 12:03.200
- [children chattering]
- trafalgar square.
Well done, bradley.

12:03.200 --> 12:05.630
- Excellent navigation skills
- [clara] aha! There it is!

12:05.640 --> 12:07.300
It's all sorted now.
Come on.

12:07.300 --> 12:08.740
Can we take a picture
with the lion, sir?

12:08.740 --> 12:12.740
- Please?
- Uh, stay together, but ok.

12:13.580 --> 12:15.210
[camera shutter clicking]

12:15.210 --> 12:17.850
I cannot believe
bradley just said "please".

12:17.850 --> 12:19.580
- Really?
- Yeah.

12:19.580 --> 12:22.850
He usually prefers
other means of persuasion.

12:22.850 --> 12:24.590
Give it. Give it!

12:24.590 --> 12:26.820
Miss! He won't lend me
his dictionary.

12:26.820 --> 12:29.390
You could try
saying "please", bradley.

12:29.390 --> 12:31.290
- [boy grunting]
- [thudding]

12:31.300 --> 12:33.000
[footsteps]

12:33.730 --> 12:35.900
And ruby.

12:35.900 --> 12:39.870
How do we find x?

12:40.440 --> 12:43.840
- Ruby?
- It's there, sir, at the top.

12:43.840 --> 12:47.780
- No, how do we find...
- It's not lost.

12:47.780 --> 12:49.540
It's there, at the top. Look.

12:49.550 --> 12:52.650
No, how do we find
the value of x?

12:52.650 --> 12:55.680
Why are you asking me
all the questions?

12:55.690 --> 12:56.920
Give someone else a go.

12:56.920 --> 12:58.620
You bring out
the best in them.

12:58.620 --> 13:01.220
- [rumbling]
- [all exclaiming]

13:04.730 --> 13:07.560
Look, sir. No rings.

13:07.560 --> 13:11.200
Trees usually have rings
to tell you how old they are.

13:11.200 --> 13:14.540
This one's got no rings.
Why is that then, sir?

13:14.540 --> 13:18.310
- The rings mark
the years of growth.
- [boy] who's that?

13:18.310 --> 13:20.540
One ring for each year.

13:20.540 --> 13:21.640
This grew up overnight,

13:21.650 --> 13:25.180
That whole tree is the result
of just one night's growth.

13:25.180 --> 13:29.020
- And they're still growing.
- Everyone, this is the doctor,

13:29.020 --> 13:31.550
And he is gonna sort everything
out, isn't that right, doctor?

13:31.560 --> 13:34.360
- That's what he does.
- Well, having looked at things,

13:34.360 --> 13:36.120
I think probably the answer
to that is no.

13:36.130 --> 13:38.130
He always says that,
he's really clever.

13:38.130 --> 13:39.560
Oh, yes, I am. Very clever.

13:39.560 --> 13:41.060
But what use is clever
against trees?

13:41.070 --> 13:43.630
They don't listen to reason,
you can't plead with them,

13:43.630 --> 13:44.630
You can't lie to them.

13:44.640 --> 13:47.300
They've got no moving parts,
no circuits.

13:47.300 --> 13:49.040
This is a natural event.

13:49.040 --> 13:50.940
How can it be natural
for a tree to grow in one night?

13:50.940 --> 13:54.140
Exactly what they said
about the ice age.

13:54.140 --> 13:56.750
"how can old glaciers
just pop up out of nowhere?"

13:56.750 --> 14:00.980
Well, they just did.
That's how this planet grows.

14:00.980 --> 14:02.980
A series of catastrophes.

14:02.990 --> 14:08.420
Farewell to the ice age,
welcome to the tree age.
Possibly.

14:08.430 --> 14:11.790
When the ice age was here,
you lot managed to cook mammoth.

14:11.800 --> 14:14.560
Now that there's a forest,
you'll just have to eat nuts.

14:14.570 --> 14:16.630
Can't eat nuts,
I've got an allergy.

14:16.630 --> 14:19.000
Don't worry,
it's a thing he does.

14:19.000 --> 14:22.500
He pretends he's not interested
and then he has an idea.

14:22.510 --> 14:26.410
- He's playing for time.
- Time.

14:27.910 --> 14:29.780
Interesting.

14:29.780 --> 14:31.450
See? Clever kicking in.

14:31.450 --> 14:33.580
A tree is a time machine.

14:33.580 --> 14:36.080
You plant a little acorn
in 1795,

14:36.090 --> 14:38.720
And in the year 2016,
there's an oak tree

14:38.720 --> 14:39.960
There, in the same spot

14:39.960 --> 14:44.560
With a tiny little bit of 1795
still alive inside of it.

14:44.560 --> 14:49.760
You can't create a whole
overnight forest with extra
special fertiliser,

14:49.770 --> 14:53.600
You have to mess
with the fabric of time.

14:53.600 --> 14:57.370
And communicate... With trees.

15:01.640 --> 15:04.250
So you're saying
it's an act of aggression?

15:04.250 --> 15:07.480
- By trees.
- Um, trees clean the air.

15:07.480 --> 15:08.780
Exactly. Well done, ruby.

15:08.790 --> 15:11.820
Someone or something who's
trying to scrub the atmosphere

15:11.820 --> 15:14.290
Before colonising or invading.

15:14.290 --> 15:16.160
Ah, yes, doctor...
[clears throat]

15:16.160 --> 15:19.760
This is coal hill year eight
gifted and talented group.

15:19.760 --> 15:21.230
What're the round bits for?

15:21.230 --> 15:22.800
Ask your teacher.
Come on, down from there!

15:22.800 --> 15:24.800
- [children chattering]
- hey! Away from the console.

15:24.800 --> 15:27.540
Come on, that's an antique.
Get away from there!
Don't touch that!

15:27.540 --> 15:31.710
Haven't any of you been struck
by the fact... Look,
it's bigger on the inside!

15:31.710 --> 15:34.540
There wasn't a forest,
then there was a forest.

15:34.550 --> 15:36.080
Nothing surprises us any more.

15:36.080 --> 15:39.750
These trees all appeared at once
and that wasn't a coincidence.

15:39.750 --> 15:43.420
There's no such thing
as an arboreal coincidence.

15:43.420 --> 15:46.590
Something, someone
has coordinated this.

15:46.590 --> 15:48.190
To coordinate,
you need to communicate.

15:48.190 --> 15:53.960
Every communication channel
on the tardis is open and...
Nothing.

15:55.770 --> 15:59.700
Except... Let me see that.

16:01.870 --> 16:04.870
Homework books.
Why are these here?

16:07.410 --> 16:08.680
Maebh arden.

16:08.680 --> 16:11.810
Maebh arden.
Which one is maebh arden?

16:11.820 --> 16:14.650
Which one's maebh? Maebh?

16:14.820 --> 16:16.120
Maebh?

16:16.120 --> 16:18.420
Maebh? Maebh?

16:18.890 --> 16:21.420
Maebh? Maebh? Maebh?

16:21.430 --> 16:25.660
- Maebh? Maebh?
- Oh, my god, maebh's gone.

16:25.660 --> 16:27.400
Maebh's lost in the forest.

16:27.400 --> 16:29.030
- Maebh's gonna die!
- [the doctor shouts]

16:29.030 --> 16:30.270
Ruby! That's enough.
Doctor...

16:30.270 --> 16:33.170
- We've gotta find her!
- Yes, I know that we have
to find her.

16:33.170 --> 16:37.340
Doctor, listen to me.
Her sister went
missing last year.

16:37.340 --> 16:39.610
She's on medication,
the child is barely functioning.

16:39.610 --> 16:42.410
She hears voices.
She's very vulnerable.

16:42.410 --> 16:46.850
- What do the voices say?
- I don't know, she takes
tablets and they stop.

16:46.850 --> 16:48.420
You people, you never learn.

16:48.420 --> 16:51.850
If a child is speaking,
listen to it.

16:51.860 --> 16:54.620
Oh, like you listened to her?

16:57.030 --> 17:01.130
He's right. She was trying
to tell me something
and I ignored her.

17:01.130 --> 17:03.470
Maebh arden is tuned
to a different channel.

17:03.470 --> 17:06.800
She can lead us to the source,
to the heart of the forest.

17:06.800 --> 17:08.740
We have to listen to her,
we have to find her.

17:08.740 --> 17:11.240
Not everything can be
fixed with a screwdriver.

17:11.240 --> 17:12.810
- It's not a magic wand.
- Does she have a phone?

17:12.810 --> 17:15.310
- Well, yeah, she does.
- Have you got the number?

17:15.310 --> 17:16.440
Um... Yep.

17:16.450 --> 17:17.650
[whirring]

17:17.650 --> 17:20.380
Maebh arden.
500 yards southeast of here.

17:20.380 --> 17:22.319
- I'll go get her.
- I'll go with him.

17:22.319 --> 17:25.490
- Oh, I can go...
- You haven't seen him
for months?

17:25.490 --> 17:27.390
Something like that.

17:27.390 --> 17:28.460
You didn't even say hello,

17:28.460 --> 17:30.590
You just sprung straight
into action.

17:31.090 --> 17:32.030
Special unit.

17:32.030 --> 17:33.760
- [boy] this is so cool.
- Hey!

17:33.760 --> 17:35.830
Do not touch anything!

17:35.830 --> 17:38.270
- Anything. Ok?!
- Ok.

17:38.270 --> 17:40.800
See? Someone needs to go,
child protection.

17:40.800 --> 17:43.870
- [children chattering]
- [child] I'm not sure
if I liked him or not.

17:43.870 --> 17:46.680
Gifted and talented, really?

17:46.680 --> 17:49.410
Furious, fearful,
tongue-tied.

17:49.410 --> 17:51.810
They're all super powers
if you use them properly.

17:51.820 --> 17:56.990
- Are they gonna be all right?
- They're in the tardis,
the safest place on the planet.

17:56.990 --> 18:00.820
[rumbling]

18:09.170 --> 18:12.730
- If this is an invasion...
- What?

18:12.740 --> 18:13.770
...It's over.

18:13.770 --> 18:15.870
They're here
and they've won.

18:15.870 --> 18:18.640
What do they want?

18:21.710 --> 18:24.280
[all coughing]

18:24.280 --> 18:27.680
We're not just gonna stand here
and let her die.

18:27.680 --> 18:28.950
- Who?
- Miss.

18:28.950 --> 18:32.290
You let her go off with some
randomer into the forest.

18:32.290 --> 18:35.060
You're supposed to be
madly in love with her.

18:35.060 --> 18:36.260
I... Who said that?

18:36.260 --> 18:38.390
- Everyone.
- She's probably
dead now anyway.

18:38.400 --> 18:42.100
- Crushed by now, sir.
- What if the trees
collapse on her?

18:42.100 --> 18:45.170
- And kill her?
- You're worrying too much.

18:45.170 --> 18:48.940
Yeah, but what if the wild
animals come out and eat her?

18:48.940 --> 18:51.570
Ruby, you're letting your
imagination run away with you.

18:51.580 --> 18:55.780
I'm not, though, am I?
Because I haven't got
an imagination.

18:55.780 --> 18:57.510
You can ask miss oswald.

18:57.510 --> 19:00.580
Ok, then. Come on,
team, let's do this.

19:00.580 --> 19:04.350
We will if you stop
calling us a team.

19:11.730 --> 19:13.330
Maebh!

19:20.040 --> 19:22.540
Doctor, look behind us,
the path.

19:22.540 --> 19:26.910
- We just walked down this,
it's overgrown already.
- [the doctor] clara.

19:31.380 --> 19:32.780
Why would she
put her phone down?

19:32.780 --> 19:33.920
Doesn't want to be followed.

19:33.920 --> 19:35.420
Lost a hold of it
in a struggle,

19:35.420 --> 19:37.320
Left it as a clue
so we would know

19:37.320 --> 19:39.150
Where she was going.
Trail of bread crumbs,

19:39.160 --> 19:41.290
- <i>Hansel and gretel.</i>
<i>- I'm actually frightened.</i>

19:41.290 --> 19:42.590
I never get frightened,
why am I frightened?

19:42.590 --> 19:44.930
- We just lost a little girl.
- Yes, that is a worry

19:44.930 --> 19:46.060
But I know you'll find her.

19:46.060 --> 19:48.560
No, no, no, this is not worry,
this is, uh, dread.

19:48.570 --> 19:51.270
- Maebh!
- You're pursuing
a little lost girl

19:51.270 --> 19:53.840
Through a mysterious forest.
The path has disappeared.

19:53.840 --> 19:58.210
You find yourself
with a strangely compelling,
masculine figure...

19:58.210 --> 20:01.840
- Maebh!
- Any minute now, we're gonna
find a gingerbread cottage

20:01.850 --> 20:04.550
With a cannibal
witch inside. Maebh!

20:04.550 --> 20:06.680
Exactly. The forest...

20:06.680 --> 20:09.420
It's in all the stories
that kept you awake at night.

20:09.420 --> 20:12.620
The forest
is mankind's nightmare.

20:12.620 --> 20:15.320
[panting]

20:51.160 --> 20:52.660
[the doctor] clara.

20:52.660 --> 20:57.770
- Is it hers?
- Yes. Clever girl.

20:59.340 --> 21:01.500
[man] get back!
We're burning here, stay back!

21:01.510 --> 21:04.710
- [clara] we're looking
for a little girl.
- Stay back,

21:04.710 --> 21:06.670
We're about to burn.

21:10.950 --> 21:13.450
[man 2] good job.

21:20.620 --> 21:24.290
- [man] what's going on?
- [man 2] trees aren't
responding to flamethrower.

21:24.290 --> 21:26.390
I mean, they don't catch fire.
They just don't catch.

21:26.400 --> 21:28.460
It's like they're
flame-proof or something.

21:28.470 --> 21:30.570
[the doctor] trees control
the oxygen on this planet.

21:30.570 --> 21:32.500
They withhold it,
they smother the fire.

21:32.500 --> 21:34.370
What sort of forest is clever?
What sort of forest

21:34.370 --> 21:35.870
Has its own in-built
fire extinguisher?

21:35.870 --> 21:37.810
- [clara] what do they want?
- [the doctor] why now?

21:37.810 --> 21:39.610
- [clara] what do you
mean "why now?"
- the whole natural order

21:39.610 --> 21:42.940
Is turning against this planet.
But why? Why now?

21:42.950 --> 21:44.680
Well, what else?

21:47.320 --> 21:50.920
How did she know this?

21:51.250 --> 21:54.490
- What is it?
- This is a massive solar flare
headed for earth,

21:54.490 --> 21:56.320
Like the one that destroyed
the bank of karabraxos.

21:56.330 --> 22:01.530
I've got an entire tardis
and I didn't notice this,
but she knew. How?

22:01.530 --> 22:03.670
This is maebh's,
where did you get this?

22:03.670 --> 22:05.000
You left your marking
on the tardis.

22:05.000 --> 22:08.270
Oh, great, right. Well, that's
just brilliant, isn't it?

22:08.270 --> 22:10.040
You don't think
danny saw this, do you?

22:10.040 --> 22:13.880
I've just informed you
that a solar flare's going
to wipe out your planet,

22:13.880 --> 22:15.510
You're worried about a row
with your boyfriend?

22:15.510 --> 22:18.850
How does she know this?
She even put the date on it!

22:18.850 --> 22:20.450
I always make them
date their homework.

22:20.450 --> 22:24.290
It's today's date.

22:28.690 --> 22:32.130
Well, there must be... A way.

22:32.130 --> 22:35.030
They want something.

22:35.030 --> 22:37.330
They're saying something.

22:37.330 --> 22:39.500
If there's a way,
the way is maebh arden.

22:39.500 --> 22:43.570
Ok, you know they're not really
gifted and talented, don't you?

22:43.570 --> 22:45.070
I just tell them that
to make them feel good.

22:45.080 --> 22:47.040
She's lost someone.
People who have lost someone,

22:47.040 --> 22:48.910
They're always listening,
they're always looking,

22:48.910 --> 22:50.450
They're always hoping.
So they notice more,

22:50.450 --> 22:56.680
- They hear more.
- [slow, distant howling]

22:56.690 --> 23:00.150
- Was that a howl?
- [howling continues]

23:00.160 --> 23:01.990
Was that a wolf?

23:02.860 --> 23:05.990
No, that is impossible,
we're in london.

23:06.000 --> 23:07.430
Would that be
the london with a zoo?

23:07.430 --> 23:09.230
The zoo with
a pack of wolves?

23:09.230 --> 23:11.600
The zoo whose barriers
and gates have probably been

23:11.600 --> 23:14.700
Mangled by the trees? No.

23:14.700 --> 23:17.370
Wolves are not impossible.

23:17.370 --> 23:20.810
Stick to the path,
red riding hood.

23:23.210 --> 23:27.220
- There is no path.
- [howling continues]

23:27.220 --> 23:29.780
Then we're lunch.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.850
[panting]

23:40.800 --> 23:44.070
- [rumbling]
- [growling]

23:50.840 --> 23:53.810
[growling]

24:05.290 --> 24:09.960
- [growling]
- [screaming]

24:11.630 --> 24:14.400
- Maebh?!
- [growling]

24:40.590 --> 24:42.520
[barking, growling]

24:42.530 --> 24:47.230
Maebh! Doctor, give me a boost
so I can pull her over.

24:47.230 --> 24:50.360
Maebh? Maebh?

24:52.130 --> 24:54.240
Maebh, you came looking for me.
You didn't...

24:54.240 --> 24:57.910
Maebh, maebh... You didn't
just stumble into the tardis.

24:57.910 --> 24:59.270
- Tell me what you know.
- Doctor...

24:59.280 --> 25:02.080
- This is important.
- Yes, can we please deal
with the wolves first?

25:02.080 --> 25:04.810
These are zoo wolves,
they're not even
used to hunting.

25:04.810 --> 25:07.050
- Doctor!
- [barking, growling]

25:07.050 --> 25:10.050
Right, ok. We just gotta
look as if we're too much bother

25:10.050 --> 25:12.890
To eat, right?
So, stay still, stay together.

25:12.890 --> 25:14.520
Look big! Look big like a big...

25:14.520 --> 25:18.990
...Three-headed, six-legged...
Scary thing!

25:22.460 --> 25:23.430
[wolves whimpering]

25:23.430 --> 25:26.730
[the doctor laughing]
I told you they were rubbish.

25:26.740 --> 25:29.500
Those wolves were terrified.

25:29.510 --> 25:32.210
What are wolves frightened of?

25:32.210 --> 25:35.540
[deep, slow growl]

25:43.720 --> 25:44.890
[roaring]

25:44.890 --> 25:47.120
There are very good, solid,
scientific reasons

25:47.120 --> 25:49.920
For being really quite
frightened just now.

25:49.930 --> 25:52.830
[roaring]

26:09.950 --> 26:12.810
[children cheering]

26:14.420 --> 26:17.550
Mr pink!
Why, thank you very much.

26:17.550 --> 26:19.590
Ah, no problem.
Just decided it was best

26:19.590 --> 26:21.890
Not to leave you alone...
With him.

26:21.890 --> 26:24.660
They've worked well together,
noticeable increase

26:24.660 --> 26:27.400
- In confidence levels
and energy.
- [clara] well done.

26:27.400 --> 26:30.300
And for saving us
from a tiger, too.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.970
Um, has she had
her medication yet?

26:32.970 --> 26:34.870
- Um, oh, no...
- No, no, not her medication.

26:34.870 --> 26:37.510
We don't want to shut her up,
we want to know what she knows.

26:37.510 --> 26:38.940
Maebh, what's the...
Maebh, what's...

26:38.940 --> 26:40.370
Maebh, what's this?
What is this?

26:40.380 --> 26:42.810
Apart from being almost
savaged by a tiger

26:42.810 --> 26:44.150
And abducted by a scotchman,

26:44.150 --> 26:46.480
She's allowed any nervous ticks
she likes, ok?

26:46.480 --> 26:48.080
This is not a nervous tick,

26:48.080 --> 26:51.190
- This is react...
- Please, just give her
her tablets.

26:51.190 --> 26:55.960
She's been in a state
since her sister went missing.

26:57.160 --> 26:59.990
Maebh! Maebh!

27:00.000 --> 27:03.530
- Maebh!
- [ruby] you won't find
your sister out there.

27:16.610 --> 27:19.050
Miss... What is it, miss?

27:19.050 --> 27:22.750
It's coming.
It's coming for everyone
and I can't un-think it.

27:22.750 --> 27:26.520
Maebh... Maebh,
this forest is communicating,

27:26.520 --> 27:31.130
With you, nobody else.
No technology can hear
what it's saying,

27:31.130 --> 27:33.430
But you can.

27:33.630 --> 27:35.760
Tell us what it wants,
where it came from.

27:35.770 --> 27:39.270
Just tell me,
who did this?

27:43.540 --> 27:46.140
It was me. I did this.

27:46.140 --> 27:48.080
I did these trees.

27:48.080 --> 27:49.680
No, maebh.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.210
You didn't make a global forest
appear overnight.

27:53.220 --> 27:57.080
- How could you do that?
- Thoughts come to me.

27:57.090 --> 28:00.760
Ever since annabelle
went missing,
I look for her everywhere.

28:00.760 --> 28:05.260
I don't find her,
but I find thoughts.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.830
The big forest was one.

28:07.830 --> 28:10.830
I thought everyone
would love it.

28:12.370 --> 28:14.500
The thoughts, the thoughts!

28:14.500 --> 28:17.040
- They go so fast.
- This is stressing me now.

28:17.040 --> 28:19.470
When I get stressed,
I forget my anger management.

28:19.480 --> 28:23.540
Maebh? Can you see something
that we can't see?

28:23.550 --> 28:25.850
Nearly too fast everywhere.

28:25.850 --> 28:28.380
Everything's subject to gravity.

28:28.380 --> 28:31.190
If I can create
a little local increase.

28:31.190 --> 28:34.490
No, you're not
experimenting on...

28:34.760 --> 28:38.660
[gasps] they're lovely.

28:39.030 --> 28:41.200
They don't like it
when you're holding them,

28:41.200 --> 28:46.000
- They want you
to let them go.
- Who are they?

28:46.340 --> 28:47.740
[deep voice speaks in unison]
we are here.

28:47.740 --> 28:53.370
Here always since the beginning
and until the end.

28:53.380 --> 28:54.740
Here, that's it?

28:54.740 --> 28:58.210
We are the green shoots that
grow between the cracks,

28:58.210 --> 29:00.820
The grass that grows over
the mass graves.

29:00.820 --> 29:05.020
After your wars are over,
we will still be here.

29:05.020 --> 29:07.250
We are the life that prevails.

29:07.260 --> 29:09.720
Why now?
Why are you here now?

29:09.730 --> 29:11.730
We hear the call and we come.

29:11.730 --> 29:15.160
As we came before
to the great north forest,

29:15.160 --> 29:18.200
Where we lie still
in the great circle,

29:18.200 --> 29:21.970
As we came to the vast
southern forest.

29:22.440 --> 29:23.970
Who's calling you now?

29:23.970 --> 29:26.810
The sun that creates,
the sun that destroys.

29:26.810 --> 29:29.140
You are hurting us,
let us go.

29:29.150 --> 29:33.050
You sent for me.
The girl came looking for me.

29:33.050 --> 29:39.020
- Why? Why me?
- We did not... Send... Pain.

29:39.020 --> 29:41.260
Did not send for you.

29:41.260 --> 29:44.960
We don't know you,
we were here before you

29:44.960 --> 29:48.000
And we'll be here after you.

29:51.030 --> 29:52.500
[grunts]

29:54.100 --> 29:57.510
That was actually quite cool.

29:57.740 --> 29:59.610
[maebh grunts]

30:00.240 --> 30:03.840
Maebh, you came looking
for the doctor. Think.

30:03.850 --> 30:05.010
Who sent you for the doctor?

30:05.010 --> 30:08.020
It was just a thought.
It was just a thought that came,

30:08.020 --> 30:09.980
I think it came from miss.

30:13.120 --> 30:15.360
They've gone.

30:16.390 --> 30:19.490
Why does everything have to go?

30:29.740 --> 30:31.740
This really is
gonna happen, isn't it?

30:31.740 --> 30:33.370
Stars implode,
planets grow cold,

30:33.380 --> 30:36.180
Catastrophe is the metabolism
of the universe.

30:36.180 --> 30:37.810
I can fight monsters,
I can't fight physics.

30:37.810 --> 30:39.980
Why would trees want to kill us?
We love trees.

30:39.980 --> 30:42.420
You've been chopping them down
for furniture for centuries.

30:42.420 --> 30:45.490
If that's love, no wonder
they're calling down fire
from the heavens.

30:45.490 --> 30:50.790
But we saw the future.
Lots of futures.

30:50.790 --> 30:53.030
Earth's futures.

30:53.260 --> 30:56.060
They're about to be erased.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.840
If you can't save them all,
save what you can.

31:06.010 --> 31:10.680
Tardis. It's a lifeboat,
isn't it?

31:11.080 --> 31:13.610
Not everybody has to die.

31:20.490 --> 31:25.160
- [danny chanting]
everywhere we go!
- [kids] everywhere we go!

31:25.160 --> 31:28.800
- People want to know.
- People want to know.

31:28.800 --> 31:33.100
- Who we are.
- [kids] who we are.

31:33.100 --> 31:35.900
[chanting continues]

31:43.550 --> 31:45.910
All right, come on, team.

31:48.350 --> 31:51.050
When they're done, you need
to get in your box and go.

31:51.050 --> 31:53.050
[the doctor] we're all going,
we're taking the kids.

31:53.060 --> 31:56.190
Taking them where?
What are you gonna do with them?

31:56.190 --> 31:57.830
Leave them on an asteroid?

31:57.830 --> 31:59.730
Find a space academy for
the gifted and talented?

31:59.730 --> 32:02.060
They just want
their mum and dads.

32:02.060 --> 32:04.830
And they're never gonna
stop wanting them.

32:07.270 --> 32:08.370
I can save you and danny.

32:08.370 --> 32:11.940
Danny pink will never leave
those kids so long
as he is breathing.

32:11.940 --> 32:13.270
[all cheering]

32:13.280 --> 32:14.840
[bradley] can we take
another selfie, sir?

32:14.840 --> 32:18.280
- [danny] of course,
come on, then.
- [children] yes!

32:22.350 --> 32:25.950
- I can save you.
- I don't want you to.

32:25.960 --> 32:31.530
- You don't want to live?
- Of course I want to live,
I just...

32:31.990 --> 32:36.200
- What?
- Don't make me say it.

32:36.200 --> 32:37.830
Say what?

32:38.670 --> 32:42.800
I don't want to be
the last of my kind.

32:46.810 --> 32:49.740
Then why did you
bring us all here?

32:50.750 --> 32:54.220
Because it's the only way
to get you back to the tardis.

32:54.220 --> 32:56.020
Make you think
you're saving someone.

32:56.020 --> 32:58.350
[sniffs] well,
you know what, doctor?

32:58.350 --> 33:03.490
This time,
the human race is saving you.

33:05.190 --> 33:08.430
Make it worthwhile.

33:09.800 --> 33:13.300
This is my world too.

33:13.300 --> 33:17.470
I walk your earth,
I breathe your air.

33:17.470 --> 33:22.340
And on behalf of this world,
you're very welcome.

33:22.350 --> 33:25.210
Now, go.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.280
Save the next one.

33:35.060 --> 33:36.760
Maebh.

33:39.430 --> 33:43.330
I'm sorry that
I couldn't help you.

33:43.330 --> 33:46.170
You helped me loads.
I thought it was all my fault.

33:46.170 --> 33:47.800
I feel much better now.

33:47.800 --> 33:50.470
Are you gonna
get rid of the forest?

33:55.180 --> 33:58.150
Hard to get rid of
a flame-proof forest, maebh, eh?

33:58.150 --> 33:59.750
Come on.

34:07.920 --> 34:13.230
[boy] "government crews
are being deployed
with the latest def...

34:13.230 --> 34:15.530
Defo..."

34:17.699 --> 34:19.100
"defoliant agent", samson.

34:19.100 --> 34:22.600
They're used to take
the leaves off the trees
so they're easier to burn.

34:22.610 --> 34:25.770
- That's harsh.
- [whirring]

34:25.780 --> 34:27.880
[bradley] where's he going?

34:29.210 --> 34:30.980
Home.

34:32.650 --> 34:34.580
He's going home.

34:35.250 --> 34:38.750
Which is exactly
where we're going.

34:47.030 --> 34:50.429
Flame-proof forest.

34:53.699 --> 34:56.770
Flame-proof forest.

34:56.770 --> 34:59.940
A thousand atom bombs
and no one hurt.

35:02.440 --> 35:04.980
I am doctor idiot.

35:04.980 --> 35:08.580
[the doctor] clara!
Come back here! Come back!

35:08.580 --> 35:11.190
- He's calling you.
- Yes, let him call.

35:11.190 --> 35:16.220
- This is more important.
- Clara! Mr pink!

35:16.230 --> 35:19.760
Maebh! All of you!
Quick! Quick, come back!

35:19.760 --> 35:23.200
Come back! Come on!

35:23.200 --> 35:27.130
Maebh, quick! Good girl,
good girl! Come on!

35:27.140 --> 35:29.740
It's there on the screen. Look.

35:29.740 --> 35:32.570
Big solar flare,
headed this way.

35:32.580 --> 35:34.380
A thousand kilometres a second.

35:34.380 --> 35:37.240
Coronal mass ejections,
geomagnetic storm, it's huge.

35:37.250 --> 35:42.980
It's brewing up a solar wind
big enough to blow
this whole planet away.

35:47.590 --> 35:50.590
I assumed your teachers
have mentioned this?

35:50.590 --> 35:54.630
I thought it would spoil
an otherwise enjoyable walk.

35:54.630 --> 35:58.100
Ok... Ok.

35:58.100 --> 36:01.100
Well, this is the bad news.

36:01.100 --> 36:04.740
The good news is,
it's happened before.

36:05.810 --> 36:07.570
And you're still here.

36:07.580 --> 36:09.110
The tunguska blast, 1908.

36:09.110 --> 36:12.580
That should have blown
the whole planet off its axis,
but it didn't.

36:12.580 --> 36:16.080
It knocked a few trees over...
Well, a few tens
of thousands of trees over.

36:16.090 --> 36:20.150
Curuca, in brazil, same story.
Earth should have been smashed,

36:20.160 --> 36:24.020
But it wasn't. What do
these things have in common?

36:24.030 --> 36:28.330
They're really,
really scaring us?

36:28.330 --> 36:29.330
Trees.

36:29.330 --> 36:33.930
Whenever there's
a planet-threatening
extra-terrestrial impact,

36:33.940 --> 36:34.940
Trees!

36:34.940 --> 36:35.800
Massive forest,

36:35.810 --> 36:37.940
Filling the atmosphere
with oxygen.

36:37.940 --> 36:39.370
Pumping it up, like a massive,

36:39.380 --> 36:43.510
Highly inflammable airbag,
so that when trouble hits...

36:43.510 --> 36:45.110
- Everyone dies.
- No.

36:45.110 --> 36:47.180
The impact burns off
the excess oxygen.

36:47.180 --> 36:50.920
You have some fairly hectic
weather for a few days

36:50.920 --> 36:56.160
And some fairly trippy-looking
sunsets, but apart from that,

36:56.160 --> 36:57.660
You will be all right.

36:57.660 --> 37:02.000
I was wrong.
The trees are not your enemy.

37:02.000 --> 37:03.600
They're your shield.

37:03.600 --> 37:06.030
They've been saving you
since forever,

37:06.040 --> 37:10.200
Protecting you from everything
that space can throw at you.

37:10.210 --> 37:12.240
The wide ring.

37:14.780 --> 37:15.780
The red ring.

37:15.780 --> 37:17.640
In the museum, ruby saw
a cross-section of a tree

37:17.650 --> 37:20.180
And one of the rings was wider
than the others and red.

37:20.180 --> 37:22.920
Atmospheric dust
captured by the trees.

37:22.920 --> 37:25.690
The fingerprint of an asteroid.
Happy red ring day.

37:25.690 --> 37:31.730
I don't get it.
If they're good, then
why are we chopping them down?

37:32.190 --> 37:34.130
The government is sending out
defoliating teams.

37:34.130 --> 37:37.230
They're dropping chemicals
on them right now.

37:37.830 --> 37:39.300
What is it with you people?

37:39.300 --> 37:40.930
You hear voices,
you want to shut them up.

37:40.940 --> 37:42.600
The trees come to save you,
you want to chop them down.

37:42.610 --> 37:46.910
[clara] you think you need
to save the world when
it's already saving itself.

37:46.910 --> 37:49.540
I did admit that I was wrong.

37:49.880 --> 37:50.840
Excellent.

37:50.850 --> 37:53.280
Mobile networks
are still operative.

37:53.280 --> 37:57.350
Right, we are gonna call
everyone on earth

37:57.350 --> 38:00.490
And tell them
to leave the trees alone.

38:02.560 --> 38:03.690
Can I do it?

38:03.690 --> 38:06.060
I started it,

38:06.060 --> 38:08.760
I should finish it.

38:08.760 --> 38:12.700
Ok. Ok.

38:12.700 --> 38:16.770
Class project: Save the earth.

38:16.770 --> 38:21.240
[children chattering quietly]

38:24.580 --> 38:28.920
Ok. I think that's it.

38:29.880 --> 38:33.690
[all phones ringing]

38:33.860 --> 38:36.620
[ringing continues]

38:41.760 --> 38:44.030
<i>[maebh] essential services</i>
<i>have been disrupted</i>

38:44.030 --> 38:47.970
<i>- Due to an unexpected forest.</i>
<i>-</i> Maebh? Where are you?

38:47.970 --> 38:51.540
We'd like to reassure you that
the situation will be rectified

38:51.540 --> 38:53.470
Very soon.
Please don't be scared.

38:53.480 --> 38:58.280
And please don't chop, spray
or harm the trees,
they're here to help.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.580
Be less scared,
be more trusting.

39:01.580 --> 39:07.320
Oh, and annabelle arden,
please come home.

39:08.360 --> 39:09.720
Ok, who would like to witness

39:09.730 --> 39:14.730
A once-in-a-billion-years
solar event at close-quarters?

39:15.000 --> 39:17.830
Mum! There's my mum!

39:24.670 --> 39:27.840
I thought I'd lost you too.

39:28.780 --> 39:31.080
Never. Not ever.

39:31.080 --> 39:33.580
[mother sighs, chuckles]

39:33.580 --> 39:36.880
- So, trip to space, anyone?
- I want my mum.

39:36.890 --> 39:38.290
I slightly want my mum too.

39:38.290 --> 39:41.290
Tell them, mr pink, what
an educational opportunity...

39:41.290 --> 39:42.590
You... You go.

39:42.590 --> 39:46.860
This... [chuckles]
this is enough for me.

39:46.860 --> 39:48.830
What?

39:49.630 --> 39:52.230
Coronal ejections,
geomagnetic storms,

39:52.230 --> 39:54.670
How often do you
get a playlist like that?

39:54.670 --> 39:57.700
I was a soldier,
I put myself at risk.

39:57.710 --> 40:04.810
I didn't try too hard to survive
but somehow, here I am.

40:05.480 --> 40:09.550
And now I can see what
I nearly lost and it's enough.

40:09.880 --> 40:11.080
I don't want to see more things,

40:11.090 --> 40:14.760
I want to see the things that
are in front of me more clearly.

40:15.360 --> 40:18.430
There are wonders here,
clara oswald.

40:18.430 --> 40:21.160
Bradley saying "please",
that's a wonder.

40:21.160 --> 40:24.130
One person is more amazing...

40:24.130 --> 40:25.930
Harder to understand,

40:25.930 --> 40:28.370
But more amazing
than universes.

40:28.370 --> 40:31.970
Really? What person
is that, then?

40:33.940 --> 40:36.480
[laughing, cheering]

40:36.480 --> 40:39.980
I told you.
I said so, didn't I?

40:39.980 --> 40:43.820
- [children chattering]
- we could have a picnic.

40:43.820 --> 40:46.890
We can't, you've got marking.

40:47.860 --> 40:50.790
Oh. Oh, no, no, no,
that was, um...

40:50.790 --> 40:52.360
That was from ages ago.
You see, what happened...

40:52.360 --> 40:56.500
They always write the date
neatly at the top of the page.

40:56.500 --> 41:00.530
- Yeah, they do, don't they?
- Yeah, last Friday.

41:00.540 --> 41:03.000
You were on the tardis
last Friday.

41:03.010 --> 41:04.570
Today you thought the world
was gonna end,

41:04.570 --> 41:06.110
- You still didn't
tell me the truth.
- No...

41:06.110 --> 41:09.640
- I tried, he interrupted.
- I just want to know the truth.

41:09.650 --> 41:12.710
I don't care what it is,
I just want to know it.

41:12.720 --> 41:14.510
Like maebh said,
like the forest.

41:14.520 --> 41:19.090
Fear a little bit less,
trust a bit more.

41:19.090 --> 41:20.520
Ok...

41:21.760 --> 41:23.660
- Well...
- No. Not now.

41:23.660 --> 41:28.860
Go home and do your marking.
Think about it, then tell me.

41:28.860 --> 41:33.530
I saved you from a tiger today,
I deserve at least that.

41:34.800 --> 41:37.040
Yes, you did.

41:37.040 --> 41:40.640
And yes, you do.

41:50.990 --> 41:52.250
I hope I'm right.

41:52.250 --> 41:56.860
It'd be slightly awkward
if the world was destroyed
at this point.

41:56.860 --> 41:58.930
What?

42:03.330 --> 42:05.430
There goes the
planet-sized airbag.

42:05.430 --> 42:10.540
That's the trees
harvesting the solar fire.

42:15.010 --> 42:18.810
[¶ woman vocalising]

42:21.650 --> 42:25.690
Now that was surprising.

42:26.790 --> 42:30.390
And I love surprises.

42:39.400 --> 42:42.870
[wind whistling]

42:43.600 --> 42:48.310
[clara] that is amazing.

42:55.350 --> 42:57.180
How will they
explain this tomorrow?

42:57.190 --> 43:00.520
You'll all forget
it ever happened.

43:00.790 --> 43:03.760
We're not going to forget
an overnight forest.

43:03.760 --> 43:05.490
You forgot the last time.

43:05.490 --> 43:10.400
You'll remember the fear
and you'll put it
into fairy stories.

43:10.400 --> 43:13.470
The human's super power:
Forgetting.

43:13.470 --> 43:15.870
If you remembered
how things felt,

43:15.870 --> 43:18.000
You'd have stopped having wars.

43:18.010 --> 43:21.880
And stopped having babies.

43:31.420 --> 43:35.760
[engine starts, motor revs]

44:00.580 --> 44:02.350
Annabelle!

44:02.350 --> 44:03.420
My annabelle!

44:03.420 --> 44:08.760
I knew you'd be here,
the thought of you came to me.

44:18.430 --> 44:22.340
- [the doctor] clara?
- Do I have your attention?

44:22.340 --> 44:25.570
You will never step inside
your tardis again.

44:26.040 --> 44:27.540
<i>[the doctor] clara,</i>
<i>what are you doing?</i>

44:27.540 --> 44:29.880
<i>[clara] time can be rewritten.</i>

44:36.450 --> 44:39.550
<i>[the doctor] clara, my clara,</i>
<i>I don't think you will!</i>

44:39.550 --> 44:42.160
- You know who I am.
- <i>[clara] I'm not clara oswald,</i>

44:42.160 --> 44:45.690
Clara oswald has never existed.
