00:39.123 --> 00:44.713
Caregiving is not just
about feeding and clothing and cleaning.

00:45.088 --> 00:48.798
It is also about understanding
how to navigate

00:48.883 --> 00:52.393
a complicated relationship
between those who give care

00:52.470 --> 00:54.890
and those who are in need of it.

00:56.307 --> 01:00.397
If you find yourself lost,
frustrated, confused,

01:00.478 --> 01:05.648
you can always come back
to this helpful mnemonic device:

01:06.234 --> 01:08.154
ALOHA.

01:08.236 --> 01:14.576
Ask, Listen, Observe, Help, Ask again.

01:15.285 --> 01:19.035
The fundamentals of caregiving
are to give care...

01:19.789 --> 01:22.249
but not care too much.

01:22.333 --> 01:25.213
If you truly want a lasting career
in caregiving,

01:25.295 --> 01:29.125
you'll need to adhere
to the caregiver commandments.

01:31.092 --> 01:32.972
Writ these down. They're important.

01:33.761 --> 01:37.431
I cannot take care of another

01:37.515 --> 01:42.435
unless I first take care of myself.

01:43.771 --> 01:47.571
Ben. Ben, come on.
I know you're in there.

01:52.196 --> 01:58.746
My needs are equal to the needs
of the person to whom I am giving care.

02:00.538 --> 02:02.368
Caregiving is difficult.

02:02.457 --> 02:08.667
All I can do is try my best
and maintain a positive attitude.

02:08.755 --> 02:11.835
Congratulations,
you're a certified caregiver.

02:12.425 --> 02:15.135
Just always remember:

02:15.928 --> 02:17.428
ALOHA.

02:18.348 --> 02:23.598
Ask, Listen, Observe, Help, Ask again.

02:24.646 --> 02:28.726
Nothing less. Nothing more.

02:41.704 --> 02:43.414
You must be Mr. Benjamin.

02:43.498 --> 02:45.918
- Elsa Conklin.
- Hi.

02:50.254 --> 02:53.764
I was transferred to the States
about nine months ago,

02:53.841 --> 02:57.471
and we've yet to find
a permanent caregiver for Trevor.

02:58.262 --> 03:01.392
The transition's been difficult,
to say the least.

03:01.474 --> 03:04.274
The flight over was the first time
he'd ever been on a plane and...

03:05.061 --> 03:08.521
Well, let's just say,
he's never really been one to relish

03:08.606 --> 03:10.266
being outside of his house,

03:10.358 --> 03:14.398
let alone 30,000 feet in the air,
or here in another country.

03:15.071 --> 03:20.241
So, tell me,
why'd you choose to be a caregiver?

03:23.371 --> 03:25.831
I like helping people.

03:26.290 --> 03:28.750
Do you have clients at the moment?
This would be full-time.

03:29.961 --> 03:31.131
No.

03:31.212 --> 03:34.552
Can you tell me about
some of your previous clients?

03:35.967 --> 03:38.047
Trevor would be my first client.

03:39.804 --> 03:43.474
Oh... I'd asked them
to only send people with experience.

03:43.975 --> 03:46.055
Oh, um...

03:46.144 --> 03:49.774
No, I have the certificate.
I took the... It's a six-week course.

03:49.856 --> 03:53.896
Yeah, I've taken it. It's all right.
It's just that I specified that we...

04:00.158 --> 04:04.118
Hello. I'm sorry. You know, I'm so sorry.
Did I do something wrong?

04:04.203 --> 04:07.503
I put on aftershave this morning.
That's something I don't normally do.

04:07.582 --> 04:08.922
Is he sensitive to smells?

04:09.876 --> 04:11.956
Trevor, that's enough.

04:16.298 --> 04:18.469
Pick a number between one and 3,500.

04:19.343 --> 04:20.433
Wha...? Huh?

04:20.511 --> 04:22.971
It's a game. Pick a number.

04:28.352 --> 04:30.562
- Three.
- Nope.

04:30.646 --> 04:33.316
Two thousand, four hundred and sixty-four.
Sorry, no job.

04:34.066 --> 04:38.236
Trevor, this is Ben. Do you have
any actual questions for him?

04:38.321 --> 04:39.715
What kind of aftershave are you wearing?

04:39.739 --> 04:41.989
- Trevor.
- What?

04:42.074 --> 04:44.845
This guy thinks retarded people get upset
by aftershave. That's brilliant.

04:44.869 --> 04:46.909
How does that work, exactly?

04:46.996 --> 04:49.116
Is it, like, "Oh, no. The smell.

04:49.207 --> 04:51.185
I don't understand where it's coming from.
Please, somebody help."

04:51.209 --> 04:55.249
You're not retarded.
And don't use that word.

04:55.338 --> 04:57.048
People worse off than you, you know?

04:57.131 --> 05:00.381
That's true. Like retarded people
that are forced to wear aftershave.

05:01.093 --> 05:04.763
Sorry. My child has a unique sense
of humor.

05:04.847 --> 05:06.137
Do you have kids?

05:08.351 --> 05:12.521
No. I know I don't have any experience,

05:12.980 --> 05:16.360
but I took the course
and I'll work very hard. I...

05:19.487 --> 05:22.697
I've been out of work for a while
and I could really use this job.

05:22.782 --> 05:25.542
Yeah, but if we're gonna
throw down nine bucks an hour

05:25.618 --> 05:29.368
for somebody to wipe my ass, we need
somebody who knows how to wipe an ass.

05:29.455 --> 05:32.785
Tell me, Ben, given the opportunity,
how exactly would you wipe my ass?

05:32.875 --> 05:34.165
You're being rude.

05:34.252 --> 05:37.132
I think it's a reasonable interview
question, given the scope of the job.

05:37.630 --> 05:40.420
True or false?
This man has to wipe my ass.

05:44.053 --> 05:46.513
I'd wipe it in such a way
that when I was done,

05:46.597 --> 05:49.137
there would be no shit left on your ass.

05:59.318 --> 06:00.948
He's the one.

06:20.631 --> 06:23.381
- Hey.
- Hi.

06:24.677 --> 06:25.927
Did you bring them?

06:28.431 --> 06:30.891
Ben, did you bring the divorce papers?

06:31.601 --> 06:33.811
Oh, you know what? Uh, I never got them.

06:35.104 --> 06:37.444
I know you got them.
I shoved them under your door.

06:37.523 --> 06:41.403
Right, I got your message about that.
That's weird. I don't...

06:41.485 --> 06:45.525
Here's a new set. Here's a pen.

06:47.199 --> 06:50.619
All right, well, I'll take these home
and, uh, I'll read them.

06:50.703 --> 06:52.833
Why are you doing this to me?

06:55.333 --> 06:58.713
Do I have to get a court order? I mean,
is that really what you want me to do?

07:01.505 --> 07:03.295
I'm not ready, Janet.

07:07.136 --> 07:09.136
It's been two-and-a-half years.

07:09.472 --> 07:12.892
What's the magic number where you wake up
and you're finally ready?

07:13.976 --> 07:17.896
Six years? Eight? Eighty?

07:20.024 --> 07:21.534
I'm sorry.

07:23.736 --> 07:25.776
I'm just not ready.

07:47.093 --> 07:48.393
Hello. Come in.

07:48.469 --> 07:50.549
- Hi.
- I'll take you on the tour.

07:51.180 --> 07:53.350
What do you know about DMD?

07:53.432 --> 07:54.892
Um...

07:55.518 --> 07:56.598
Uh...

07:56.686 --> 08:00.016
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.
When you get home tonight, google it.

08:00.106 --> 08:03.566
- Yes, I...
- I work as the office manager in a bank.

08:03.651 --> 08:05.611
It's a big bank,
but I work in a small branch,

08:05.695 --> 08:07.405
which means if I'm late, they notice.

08:07.488 --> 08:09.925
I have to leave here at 8:40,
which means you have to be here at 8:40.

08:09.949 --> 08:12.636
You're late, I'm late. I can't be late.
No one else to pay the bills.

08:12.660 --> 08:17.370
Every day we stretch his hamstrings,
heel cords, IT-bands, hip flexors,

08:17.456 --> 08:20.576
and forearms on the bed.
I'll demonstrate that for you.

08:20.668 --> 08:23.548
He sleeps most nights with
the C-pap machine to help his breathing.

08:23.629 --> 08:27.169
Trevor's extremely tied to his routine.
It cannot be disrupted.

08:27.258 --> 08:29.548
If it's disrupted,
he'll have a panic attack.

08:29.635 --> 08:33.424
He wakes at the same time every day,
he watches TV at the same time every day.

08:33.514 --> 08:34.914
He eats at the same time every day.

08:34.974 --> 08:37.063
Once a week,
he goes to the park on Thursdays.

08:37.143 --> 08:39.852
Always on Thursdays.
Always from 1 to 4. Exactly 1 to 4.

08:39.937 --> 08:42.687
He only eats waffles and sausage.
Two waffles, one sausage.

08:42.773 --> 08:44.073
Breakfast, lunch and dinner.

08:44.150 --> 08:48.820
Not ideal, but it's a battle I'm done
fighting and the vitamins fill in the gap.

08:48.904 --> 08:51.574
Hey. Check her out.

08:51.657 --> 08:54.197
Oldest working family farms
in Jerome, Idaho...

08:54.285 --> 08:58.575
Would you tap that? Because I would
pound that shit into the ground.

08:58.664 --> 09:02.174
His medications are also
on a precise schedule.

09:02.251 --> 09:04.051
It's all in this notebook.

09:04.128 --> 09:08.668
Prescription meds,
Deflazacort, Losartan, Eplerenone.

09:08.758 --> 09:10.758
Those you absolutely can't miss.

09:10.843 --> 09:13.853
Then the supplements,
Protandim, Haelan, omega fatty acids,

09:13.929 --> 09:17.429
calcium, vitamin D, Co Q10,
creatine, glutamine, Quercetin,

09:17.516 --> 09:19.266
multi-vitamin, and mega green tea.

09:19.351 --> 09:22.071
Why don't you read the notebook
and we'll talk more thoroughly later.

09:22.146 --> 09:25.896
Statistically, Trevor probably
has another seven to ten years.

09:25.983 --> 09:28.573
So, let's do everything right, okay?

09:31.530 --> 09:35.580
- I need to hear you say "okay."
- Yes. Okay. Absolutely.

09:45.836 --> 09:49.336
Trevor, it's his first day.
Please don't make him cry.

09:55.304 --> 09:59.064
- You need anything?
- I do, actually.

09:59.141 --> 10:00.741
Could you call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation

10:00.768 --> 10:03.098
and tell them I want a blowjob
from Katy Perry?

10:11.612 --> 10:14.622
I mean, she kind of has to say yes, right?
Think about it.

10:14.698 --> 10:18.078
If she was to reject me,
that would a PR nightmare for her.

10:18.160 --> 10:19.910
It'd be a shit storm.

10:21.372 --> 10:24.082
What do we have here?
A two-story outhouse.

10:24.166 --> 10:29.126
Aha. Here we go. Idaho Falls, Idaho.
Two-story outhouse.

10:30.047 --> 10:34.177
I'm no expert. I definitely think
I'd prefer to be on the upper level.

10:34.260 --> 10:37.100
- He apparently...
- What is this gem, you ask?

10:37.179 --> 10:40.889
This is a map of your precious country's
lamest roadside attractions,

10:40.975 --> 10:45.095
odd museums, bizarre landmarks,
and of course anything giant,

10:45.187 --> 10:49.147
- from farm animals to cherry pie.
- What's the red star?

10:49.233 --> 10:52.823
That, my friend, is
the world's deepest pit. My favorite.

10:52.903 --> 10:57.203
It just sounds so depressing, I love it.
Pick a number between one and 3,500.

10:58.450 --> 11:01.500
Go on, Ben. We've got
some time to kill. One and 3,500.

11:01.579 --> 11:03.959
- Three.
- One-5-5-5. You're not even trying.

11:04.039 --> 11:08.039
But I have some fantastic news,
I need to take a dump.

11:08.586 --> 11:09.836
Why is that fantastic news?

11:09.920 --> 11:13.840
Because it's your time to shine. Let's go.

11:23.726 --> 11:24.806
Ow.

11:24.894 --> 11:27.984
I need to take a shit, come on.
Come on, be serious.

11:28.063 --> 11:29.613
Take my legs.

11:32.568 --> 11:33.837
How does it make sense to take my legs?

11:33.861 --> 11:35.861
Are you gonna drag me to the toilet?
Put them down.

12:01.263 --> 12:02.853
- You all right?
- Yeah.

12:03.599 --> 12:05.099
Hold on, hold on.

12:10.481 --> 12:13.231
Do you wanna just shit in your chair,
maybe?

12:13.317 --> 12:14.567
Maybe.

12:14.652 --> 12:18.612
Ben. Ben, it's jammed. Ben, help!

12:18.697 --> 12:23.327
Who do you think would win
in a fight to the death. Me or a bird?

12:26.372 --> 12:29.922
Help me! Help me!

12:36.298 --> 12:37.758
Help!

12:37.841 --> 12:39.841
How about me versus a lot of birds,

12:39.927 --> 12:42.847
but all the birds
also had muscular dystrophy?

12:46.266 --> 12:50.396
I think a bunch of big birds with
muscular dystrophy are fucking you up.

13:03.826 --> 13:06.786
- I enjoy this time together.
- Me too.

13:10.374 --> 13:12.084
Can I ask you a question?

13:13.877 --> 13:14.997
What?

13:17.756 --> 13:22.676
If you woke up
and you were totally... fine...

13:24.763 --> 13:27.643
what's the thing you'd wanna do most?

13:29.685 --> 13:30.885
If I could do anything at all?

13:35.899 --> 13:38.529
I'd really like to take a pee standing up.

13:43.824 --> 13:45.164
Yeah, it's pretty awesome.

13:54.835 --> 13:56.245
Bye.

13:56.336 --> 13:58.576
If somebody tries to rob the bank today,
don't be a hero.

13:58.630 --> 14:01.130
I can't promise anything
once the adrenalin kicks in.

14:01.216 --> 14:02.216
Fair enough.

14:07.890 --> 14:11.390
Did you arrange these to look
like large testicles and a small penis?

14:15.355 --> 14:18.565
- Yep.
- Brilliant.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.860
- Enjoy your breakfast.
- Thanks.

14:23.572 --> 14:26.832
You never told me what you did before
you got into the ass-wiping business.

14:26.909 --> 14:28.909
- I was a writer.
- No, you weren't. Really?

14:28.994 --> 14:31.834
Yeah. I wrote a couple of novels
you've never heard of.

14:31.914 --> 14:36.004
You're right. So, what is this?
Is this, like, research for you?

14:36.085 --> 14:39.545
- Hardly. I'm retired.
- You're retired. Right.

14:39.630 --> 14:42.260
Well, man, you should write about me.

14:42.341 --> 14:45.681
Well, that would make
for a really interesting read.

14:45.761 --> 14:48.721
Chapter One, Watches TV.

14:48.806 --> 14:51.476
Chapter Two, Eats Waffles.

14:51.558 --> 14:56.358
Chapter Three,
Watches TV, Then Eats Waffles.

14:56.438 --> 15:00.278
- It writes itself.
- Seriously, I'm your man.

15:00.359 --> 15:04.569
And when you do write about me, I want you
to describe me as handsome and cool.

15:04.655 --> 15:06.525
The best stuff is truthful.

15:25.634 --> 15:27.344
Ben Benjamin?

15:27.928 --> 15:29.758
I have something for you.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.982
Hey, wait!

15:33.684 --> 15:35.524
This is a court order!

15:37.646 --> 15:39.266
I know where you live!

15:56.248 --> 15:58.748
You're just in time. The hot chick is on.

15:58.834 --> 16:01.884
And today I'm going to visit with Rufus,
the world's...

16:01.962 --> 16:03.857
If I had one night with her,
I swear when I was done,

16:03.881 --> 16:05.511
she wouldn't be able to walk properly.

16:05.591 --> 16:07.631
Oh, because you'd give
her muscular dystrophy?

16:08.469 --> 16:09.469
Cute.

16:09.553 --> 16:12.103
Rufus weighs 2,100 pounds.

16:12.181 --> 16:16.731
Hey, check it out. World's
biggest bovine. Ritzville, Washington.

16:16.810 --> 16:20.650
Ritzville. That's not far from here.

16:22.399 --> 16:25.029
What if we saw
some of these places for real?

16:25.110 --> 16:28.110
Have you been working
with lead-based paint in an enclosed area?

16:28.197 --> 16:30.777
Come on. Don't you get bored
just sitting in this room

16:30.866 --> 16:32.446
and going to the park once a week?

16:32.534 --> 16:35.954
I mean, doesn't any part of you want
to see the world's deepest pit in person,

16:36.038 --> 16:37.458
not just on TV?

16:37.539 --> 16:39.459
I do. But if we're making bucket lists,

16:39.541 --> 16:42.591
I'd put that way behind nailing
the Seattle Seahawk cheerleaders

16:42.669 --> 16:45.919
- in a pyramid formation.
- I do hope that's televised.

16:47.382 --> 16:49.012
Embarrassing.

16:50.719 --> 16:53.259
All right. So, we go to a Seahawks game.

16:53.347 --> 16:56.227
You know, most disabled people
don't just sit in their houses all day.

16:56.308 --> 17:00.228
They get out and do things
like everybody else. You got a letter.

17:18.829 --> 17:20.670
What are those?

17:21.625 --> 17:24.994
Letters... from my father.

17:26.296 --> 17:28.336
I didn't realize you had a father.

17:28.924 --> 17:31.394
I was born, wasn't I?
It means I have a father.

17:31.468 --> 17:33.428
No, I know, but...

17:33.512 --> 17:36.522
He left when I was three.
Right when I was diagnosed.

17:36.598 --> 17:40.848
- Probably just a silly coincidence.
- Oh. Sorry.

17:43.855 --> 17:47.525
Can you feel the love tonight?
Well, I sure can. It's Valentine's Day.

17:47.609 --> 17:49.779
And what more of a romantic place
to spend it

17:49.861 --> 17:51.701
than here in Devil's Lake, North Dakota.

17:51.780 --> 17:55.410
- So, you don't even read those?
- Really? We're still going on about this?

17:56.785 --> 17:58.405
Sorry, it's just...

17:59.454 --> 18:03.084
I... I don't know.
Aren't you even curious?

18:03.166 --> 18:07.416
- I mean, it seems like he's reaching out...
- I used to read them. They're lame.

18:07.504 --> 18:10.594
- Do you ever write back?
- No, I have not written him back.

18:12.551 --> 18:15.511
- Does he say he's sorry for leaving?
- What's with you today?

18:15.596 --> 18:18.032
He made his choice when I was three.
It was his choice, not mine.

18:18.056 --> 18:20.806
He can live with it.
Let's leave it at that.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.955
I'm just saying, you know,
he is still your father, maybe...

18:23.979 --> 18:25.309
He's not still my father.

18:25.397 --> 18:27.897
Okay? A father is supposed to be there
for his kid.

18:27.983 --> 18:30.613
Protect him from harm.
That's the only job a father has.

18:31.862 --> 18:34.322
You don't have a kid,
so what would you know about it?

18:35.782 --> 18:37.742
This combination
of meals is simply...

18:37.826 --> 18:41.366
There we go.
Now go get me some juice.

18:43.290 --> 18:46.420
Hey, juice. Come on.
We're not paying you to sit on your ass.

18:58.680 --> 19:00.270
Mr. Benjamin!

19:02.643 --> 19:07.733
Mr. Benjamin!
Mr. Benjamin, I'm not gonna leave!

19:11.693 --> 19:13.653
Thank you for staying.

19:13.737 --> 19:18.077
Ever since I started, they've been begging
me to go to happy hour on Thursday.

19:18.158 --> 19:20.948
I finally relented,
just to get them off my back.

19:21.036 --> 19:24.866
- I won't be too late.
- Oh, it's fine. Trev's napping.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.286
Oh, there's another thing.

19:26.375 --> 19:30.335
Work's asked me to go to Atlanta
for a week for a training seminar.

19:30.420 --> 19:34.470
- Oh. Why don't I stay here with Trev?
- Thank you.

19:36.051 --> 19:37.681
Um...

19:37.761 --> 19:39.351
There's one more thing.

19:39.429 --> 19:44.099
You know, over the years, Trevor's
never become attached to any caregiver.

19:44.810 --> 19:50.400
I'm so pleased you two get on so well,
but... you won't be here forever.

19:53.735 --> 19:55.855
I know about your son.

20:01.118 --> 20:04.288
You know,
I wouldn't let you be with Trevor

20:04.371 --> 20:07.211
without first doing my due diligence.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.540
What do you know exactly?

20:10.669 --> 20:13.669
Everything. So does Trevor.

20:14.756 --> 20:15.966
I'm so sorry, Ben.

20:17.676 --> 20:18.886
I can't even...

20:18.969 --> 20:21.389
- Trevor knows what happened?
- Yeah.

20:21.471 --> 20:23.641
Three years is not a very long time,

20:23.724 --> 20:26.814
and I can only guess
at your emotional state.

20:26.893 --> 20:29.693
I can't have you getting too close
to Trevor.

20:29.771 --> 20:33.611
I can't have you making promises
you can't keep.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.568
ALOHA, right?

20:37.487 --> 20:40.777
Ask, Listen, Observe, Help, Ask again.

20:41.616 --> 20:43.196
Nothing more, yeah?

20:48.373 --> 20:50.633
Sounds like my very obnoxious ride.

21:00.469 --> 21:04.639
You knew about my kid and you said
all that father bullshit to me? Huh?

21:04.723 --> 21:06.200
You think
because you're in a wheelchair

21:06.224 --> 21:08.286
that gives you the right to say and do
whatever you want?

21:08.310 --> 21:09.704
You ever considered
that maybe I'm just a prick,

21:09.728 --> 21:10.978
with or without the wheelchair?

21:14.608 --> 21:17.438
Fuck you. And fuck your wheelchair.

21:17.527 --> 21:20.947
And fuck your waffles and your stupid
fucking map with all the places

21:21.031 --> 21:22.671
that you're never ever gonna fucking see.

21:22.741 --> 21:24.831
Fuck those letters
that you'll never reply to

21:24.910 --> 21:27.660
'cause you're such
a self-absorbed piece of shit.

21:29.915 --> 21:33.375
Is that the best you can do?
That's it? I thought you were a writer.

21:33.460 --> 21:37.800
Fuck this, fuck that. That's really lame.
I think you need a second draft.

21:38.340 --> 21:42.180
I don't buy any of your bullshit.
You can make jokes all you want,

21:42.260 --> 21:47.390
but you are wasting your life by sitting
in this house and watching TV.

21:47.474 --> 21:49.774
Yeah? And what the fuck are you doing?

21:52.020 --> 21:53.940
It's been three years, Ben.

21:54.022 --> 21:56.902
Should you really be wiping my ass
for $9 an hour?

22:38.900 --> 22:42.110
Sounds like you and Trevor
had quite a night last night.

22:44.698 --> 22:48.028
- Yeah, sorry about...
- I specifically warned you

22:48.118 --> 22:50.868
about the nature of your relationship,
didn't I?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.920
Yeah, you did, but...

22:53.999 --> 22:58.249
What makes you think I would ever let you
take my son on a road trip?

23:00.505 --> 23:03.585
And now if I don't let him go see
the world's deepest pit

23:03.675 --> 23:05.555
or biggest cow or whatever,
he's gonna be upset.

23:05.594 --> 23:08.764
But of course I can't actually let him go.

23:10.974 --> 23:13.444
Look, well, whatever.
When Ben burst into my room

23:13.518 --> 23:16.238
and said we should go on a trip,
it just seemed like it would be fun.

23:16.271 --> 23:21.151
- You know? So, just forget it.
- Well, it's not happening.

23:21.234 --> 23:24.034
And I resent being put in this position.

23:24.654 --> 23:26.954
Honestly, what were you thinking?

23:32.912 --> 23:37.252
- I was thinking it would be good for him.
- Good for him?

23:37.334 --> 23:40.134
Do you have any idea what traveling
with someone like Trevor entails?

23:40.211 --> 23:41.921
You lose his Deflazacort, then what?

23:42.005 --> 23:45.625
Or the C-pap breaks in the middle
of nowhere? That be good for him?

23:45.717 --> 23:48.467
He's never been more than an hour
from his house.

23:49.846 --> 23:52.136
Maybe it's time to change that.

23:58.855 --> 24:04.275
Look. It takes three or four days
to get to the world's deepest pit. Right?

24:04.361 --> 24:07.491
We can see a lot of these other
roadside attractions along the way.

24:07.572 --> 24:11.282
Two days to get back,
we're gone for a week.

24:11.368 --> 24:13.618
I chart out all the hospitals
along the way.

24:13.703 --> 24:16.833
And they'll lend me the van so we can
carry all of Trevor's machines and stuff.

24:16.915 --> 24:18.875
We can go while you're in Atlanta.

24:18.958 --> 24:24.758
You're suggesting I risk my son's life
so he can see a hole in the earth?

24:26.007 --> 24:29.007
I'm suggesting that your son gets out
of the living room.

24:38.603 --> 24:42.613
Right. When I get back from work, we're
gonna sit down and plan this to the T.

24:42.691 --> 24:44.111
Wait. What?

24:46.778 --> 24:49.674
Well done. That was very heroic how you
jumped in there without missing a beat.

24:49.698 --> 24:53.238
- But I'm sorry, I can't do it.
- Why? This is your idea.

24:53.326 --> 24:55.496
I know, but I think I was caught up
in the moment.

24:55.578 --> 24:58.868
That moment being you telling me
to go fuck myself repeatedly.

24:58.957 --> 25:02.497
This is great. The open road.

25:02.585 --> 25:04.795
You know what? I'm gonna call
the Make-A-Wish Foundation

25:04.879 --> 25:08.129
and I'll get Katy Perry to meet us
at a motel in Missoula.

25:08.216 --> 25:10.926
What song do you want her to sing
while she's doing you?

25:16.766 --> 25:18.306
"Fireworks."

25:27.819 --> 25:31.409
- Did you get the van serviced?
- The van is serviced and ready to go.

25:31.489 --> 25:33.949
- When?
- Everything's up to date.

25:34.033 --> 25:36.053
Meaning you got it serviced
specifically for the trip,

25:36.077 --> 25:38.431
or you got it serviced at the normal time
it was supposed to be serviced?

25:38.455 --> 25:41.575
I want a text or a phone call
every three hours.

25:41.666 --> 25:43.836
Hey, do you know
when he got the van serviced?

25:43.918 --> 25:46.048
- Let's call this off.
- Okay.

25:46.129 --> 25:47.169
He needs this.

25:47.255 --> 25:48.733
- Do you need this?
- I don't need this.

25:48.757 --> 25:50.717
He says he doesn't need this.

25:50.800 --> 25:55.100
Elsa, I won't let anything happen
to your son.

26:07.150 --> 26:08.320
I love you.

26:09.027 --> 26:12.447
"He died trying to see the world's
deepest pit" is a really bad obituary.

26:13.364 --> 26:14.744
Or is it?

27:19.347 --> 27:20.427
Okay.

27:23.476 --> 27:26.476
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

27:26.563 --> 27:30.113
It's all right. Here. I got you.
I got you. I got you. Look.

27:30.191 --> 27:32.691
The road is all about living the dream,
my friend.

27:32.777 --> 27:34.630
What are you talking about?
What are you doing? What are you doing?

27:34.654 --> 27:37.874
You are gonna pee standing up.

27:37.949 --> 27:40.409
No, no, no. Honestly,
it's not gonna work. It's a mistake.

27:40.493 --> 27:42.137
- It's gonna work. All right?
- No, no, no.

27:42.161 --> 27:43.251
It's fine. I got you.

27:43.329 --> 27:44.999
- Give me a sec.
- I've got you. Shh.

27:45.081 --> 27:47.211
Shh. Shh.

27:47.292 --> 27:50.462
It is okay... Oh! Stop for a second.
Stop for a second.

27:50.545 --> 27:52.165
- I can't stop.
- Grab your penis!

27:52.255 --> 27:55.625
- I am! I've got my penis!
- That's holding your penis?

27:58.845 --> 28:02.635
- Time for a little celebration.
- What are we celebrating?

28:02.724 --> 28:04.894
This is the farthest
you've ever been from home.

28:04.976 --> 28:07.146
What are you talking about?
I lived in England.

28:07.228 --> 28:09.108
You know what I mean.

28:11.024 --> 28:14.364
- You ever had a Slim Jim?
- What do you think?

28:15.278 --> 28:18.408
- I think it's time.
- Not happening. No.

28:18.489 --> 28:21.119
We have enough newness going on here.

28:22.035 --> 28:25.705
Dude, were you...?
Were you just doing air quotes?

28:27.040 --> 28:30.380
Don't... Don't ever do that again.
Trust me.

28:30.460 --> 28:33.670
Come on.
This is what road trips are all about.

28:35.506 --> 28:36.716
No.

28:38.509 --> 28:40.139
It's really good.

28:40.678 --> 28:42.008
Mmm!

28:42.889 --> 28:44.269
Mmm!

28:44.349 --> 28:46.269
That's a hell of a meat stick.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.309
Mmm!

28:48.645 --> 28:49.975
Oh.

28:50.855 --> 28:53.265
Try it? Just try it?

28:54.025 --> 28:57.145
Come on, have a bite of the Jim.
Bite the Jim.

28:58.154 --> 28:59.614
Nibble on the Jim.

29:00.114 --> 29:02.584
Bite of the James? Hm?

29:02.659 --> 29:06.749
Isn't that what they say in your country?
A little bite of the James, shall we?

29:07.288 --> 29:09.288
Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

29:09.749 --> 29:12.169
Mmm! Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.

29:12.502 --> 29:15.052
Little bite of James!

29:15.129 --> 29:17.589
Go on! Have a bite of James!

29:19.050 --> 29:21.840
Let me see if there's any food
in there I can actually eat.

29:53.418 --> 29:55.378
Cool fucking sneakers.

29:59.590 --> 30:00.840
Mall.

30:21.487 --> 30:22.857
Mall.

30:24.574 --> 30:27.204
What does that even mean? Mall?

30:28.411 --> 30:29.847
It means that's where you get them from.

30:29.871 --> 30:34.631
No, I know, but you didn't get them there.
You got them online.

30:34.709 --> 30:36.169
It's where one would get them.

30:39.380 --> 30:41.220
Although, you didn't say that.

30:41.299 --> 30:44.139
I mean, you didn't say,
"Oh, you know, I got them at the mall."

30:44.218 --> 30:45.888
You just said, "Mall."

30:47.972 --> 30:50.852
Just one word. One syllable.

30:50.933 --> 30:53.733
Well, I thought it was good
to get straight to the point.

30:54.896 --> 30:58.356
Technically, that's the least amount
that you could say to a girl

30:58.441 --> 31:01.281
and still have it qualify
as a conversation.

31:03.071 --> 31:05.321
You know what? I'm wrong.

31:05.406 --> 31:08.446
I'm wrong.
There is something shorter. "Ma."

31:08.534 --> 31:11.834
What do you know about girls?
Your wife is trying to divorce you.

31:11.913 --> 31:16.883
- "Cool sneakers." "Ma."
- I'm in a fucking wheelchair, okay?

31:16.959 --> 31:18.339
I could spew Shakespeare shit

31:18.419 --> 31:20.669
and a girl like that's not
gonna be interested in me.

31:20.755 --> 31:24.375
- Ma.
- Fuck you, you're a 45-year-old ass-wiper.

31:24.467 --> 31:25.587
Ma.

31:32.058 --> 31:34.018
♪ Ma, ma, ma ♪

31:34.727 --> 31:36.017
♪ Ma, ma, ma ♪

31:36.104 --> 31:39.234
- I think I'm gonna give one of these a go.
- Yeah?

31:39.315 --> 31:40.645
- Yeah.
- Good.

31:40.733 --> 31:42.943
See, I knew
the open road would be good for you.

31:52.412 --> 31:55.042
What do you think? It's good, right?

32:00.628 --> 32:02.128
Nice try.

32:06.843 --> 32:09.013
That's really good. That's really funny.

32:21.315 --> 32:23.525
Would you quit screwing around?
I'm driving.

32:27.029 --> 32:28.029
Oh, shit.

32:37.832 --> 32:39.502
Oh, shit.

32:43.838 --> 32:46.048
Come on. Come on.

32:49.343 --> 32:53.143
Goddamn it! Oh, you fucker!

32:54.474 --> 32:57.234
Don't ever do that again!
You scared the shit out of me!

32:59.770 --> 33:03.110
- I'm just kidding.
- Jesus Christ!

33:08.779 --> 33:10.989
You know,
these are actually not that bad.

33:11.741 --> 33:14.491
- Bite of the James?
- Fuck you.

33:25.087 --> 33:28.467
Whoa. Check it out, man.

33:29.675 --> 33:31.675
Moo!

34:11.132 --> 34:14.973
Hey, we're here to see Rufus,
the world's biggest bovine.

34:15.054 --> 34:19.103
Okay, that's gonna be $4 apiece,
and what you're gonna do is...

34:20.101 --> 34:24.440
Oh, I'm, uh... I'm sorry.
We keep, uh, Rufus on the second floor.

34:25.940 --> 34:29.030
- Oh, you don't have handicap access?
- No. Sorry about that.

34:29.110 --> 34:31.449
It's not a problem. Seriously.

34:31.529 --> 34:34.569
What? No. It is a problem.
It's a huge problem.

34:34.657 --> 34:37.447
No, you can go up and take a look at it
and then tell me about it.

34:37.534 --> 34:38.695
No!

34:40.079 --> 34:42.539
You're in violation of codes.

34:42.623 --> 34:47.632
Look, why don't you and your son just
pick out something from our gift shop.

34:47.712 --> 34:49.815
I don't think you understand
the gravity of the situation here.

34:49.839 --> 34:51.799
Wait a sec.
You think we're father and son?

34:51.882 --> 34:55.431
We came to see a giant cow.
We're going to see a giant cow.

34:55.511 --> 34:58.115
I mean, what about the different accents?
Does that not bother you?

34:58.139 --> 35:00.889
- Look. Here's a postcard.
- Postcard?

35:00.975 --> 35:04.145
You think that's gonna solve this? What,
are you working with lead-based paint?

35:04.228 --> 35:06.308
Hey, what the fuck? That's mine.

35:06.397 --> 35:11.437
Look, it's just like a regular cow
but bigger.

35:11.527 --> 35:13.987
And we wanna see it.
And that's your problem.

35:14.071 --> 35:18.281
Because you're the one that went into
the giant cow-showing profession, not me.

35:18.367 --> 35:21.657
So, it's you that's gonna figure out
how we're gonna see a giant fucking cow,

35:21.746 --> 35:24.850
or else I'm gonna call the local news,
and I'm gonna have them send down the guy

35:24.874 --> 35:27.294
that does that "Shame on You"
business-buster thing,

35:27.376 --> 35:30.416
and he's gonna come down
with multiple cameras... Multiple cameras.

35:30.504 --> 35:33.384
...and ask you why you think it's okay
that somebody with disabilities

35:33.466 --> 35:35.586
isn't allowed to see a giant cow
like everyone else.

35:35.676 --> 35:37.237
What number are you even dialing
right now?

35:37.261 --> 35:38.851
Shut up.

35:41.766 --> 35:45.436
It's ringing. What's it gonna be?

35:51.317 --> 35:53.086
- Left! And careful, careful, careful.
- Not that much! Not that much!

35:53.110 --> 35:55.270
- I got you, I got you!
- You're gonna crush us, Mikey!

35:55.613 --> 35:57.493
Take as long as you need.

36:35.027 --> 36:36.197
- You good?
- Yeah, you?

36:36.278 --> 36:37.448
Yeah.

36:38.447 --> 36:39.987
Thank you.

36:44.870 --> 36:46.431
Come on! I'm losing my grip!
I'm losing my grip!

36:46.455 --> 36:48.215
- No, wait!
- Okay, okay. No, please don't...

36:50.835 --> 36:53.335
Well, I got good news and bad news.

36:53.421 --> 36:56.471
The good news is I talked
to the Make-A-Wish folks,

36:56.549 --> 36:58.629
and Katy Perry is all lined up.

36:59.260 --> 37:04.520
The bad news is
she's refusing to sing "Fireworks."

37:05.307 --> 37:09.517
Apparently, she's done that
with the last four Make-A-Wish kids.

37:09.603 --> 37:12.273
- She feels it's played out.
- I wanna go and see my father.

37:12.356 --> 37:13.766
What?

37:14.442 --> 37:16.572
He owns a car dealership
in Salt Lake City.

37:16.652 --> 37:19.862
- Your father's in America?
- He's an American.

37:19.947 --> 37:23.777
They met in the UK. Made me here,
then we moved back when he ditched us.

37:23.868 --> 37:26.698
I've been thinking about what you said
and I should hear him out.

37:26.787 --> 37:29.827
Oh, I don't... Oh, I don't...

37:31.250 --> 37:32.590
Look, I mean...

37:33.377 --> 37:36.377
I just... Here's the thing.
I don't know what I'm talking about.

37:38.841 --> 37:40.891
- I have to talk to your mom.
- No, definitely not.

37:40.968 --> 37:43.168
She isn't gonna let me go.
She barely let me go on this.

37:43.971 --> 37:45.681
Well, you should call him first.

37:45.765 --> 37:48.725
No. No, no, no.
If we're gonna do it, we just do it.

37:49.226 --> 37:51.436
I wanna see the look on his face.

37:51.520 --> 37:54.730
This was your idea.
Don't start pussying out now.

37:58.819 --> 38:00.149
Okay.

38:04.575 --> 38:06.035
What are you gonna say to him?

38:06.952 --> 38:09.162
Isn't it more about
what he's gonna say to me?

38:18.297 --> 38:20.257
Dude, look at this.

38:22.134 --> 38:23.894
I just texted this to your mom.

38:30.184 --> 38:31.524
Oh.

38:32.937 --> 38:37.567
- What do you suppose her deal is?
- Obviously, she wants me bad.

38:38.484 --> 38:41.244
What if she's a runaway
and her parents are looking for her?

38:42.780 --> 38:44.910
Should we give her a ride?

38:45.783 --> 38:47.203
What?

38:47.284 --> 38:49.664
She's hitchhiking.
Maybe we should give her a ride.

38:49.745 --> 38:52.405
- Want to?
- Why, you think we should?

38:53.707 --> 38:56.186
- You're probably right. We shouldn't.
- Well, I didn't said we shouldn't, did I?

38:56.210 --> 38:59.590
I said that, you know, it's just like,
whatever. If you want to, then...

38:59.672 --> 39:03.302
Then I guess we can. If you're feeling
fatherly and protective and shit.

39:03.384 --> 39:05.514
Nah, forget it.

39:16.188 --> 39:18.018
I'm worried about her parents.

39:19.608 --> 39:22.188
Yeah? Worried about her parents, are you?

39:22.278 --> 39:24.948
Deeply, actually.
'Cause she's out there alone.

39:25.030 --> 39:26.967
And in today's world,
there's no telling what could happen.

39:26.991 --> 39:31.411
There's all sorts of sickos out there.
And quite possibly in here.

39:36.041 --> 39:37.671
Let's do it.

39:39.169 --> 39:42.629
- Seriously?
- Yeah. Let's give her a ride.

39:44.717 --> 39:46.967
Okay. Yeah, why not, right?

39:47.052 --> 39:51.722
- Yeah, okay, yeah. Let's do it.
- Yeah. Go ask her.

39:52.892 --> 39:55.982
- What? Me?
- Yeah. You.

39:56.061 --> 39:57.455
No, I'm not asking. I can't ask her.

39:57.479 --> 39:59.319
- I'm not asking her.
- Why?

39:59.398 --> 40:01.978
Because I can't, okay?
Don't be a dick. You ask her.

40:02.067 --> 40:05.357
Man, if I go ask her, you're gonna be
watching it through this window

40:05.446 --> 40:07.356
like you were watching TV.

40:15.915 --> 40:19.285
You know, when I get home, I'm gonna
put you on the roadside attractions map.

40:19.376 --> 40:21.126
World's biggest dick.

40:24.298 --> 40:28.298
Hey, hey, hey. Let me just give you
a little bit of advice, okay?

40:29.136 --> 40:33.466
- What?
- Go with that mall rap again.

40:34.808 --> 40:38.348
I don't know if you remember it.
It's just one word. Just "mall."

40:41.732 --> 40:44.652
- I'm giving you the finger.
- Well, not really.

41:18.102 --> 41:19.352
I got it.

41:30.572 --> 41:33.742
- Hi there.
- Who the fuck are you?

41:33.826 --> 41:38.536
- Ben. My name's Ben.
- Oh, shit. Are you a pervert?

41:39.289 --> 41:42.669
- What?
- Look, I'm 21. Full-on adult.

41:42.751 --> 41:45.051
So, if you're into picking up kids
on the highway,

41:45.129 --> 41:49.219
- please just leave me the fuck alone.
- I'm not a pervert.

41:49.299 --> 41:51.759
That's exactly what a pervert would say.

41:51.844 --> 41:55.434
Right. I just wanna help you out.

41:55.514 --> 41:57.984
Are you hungry?
Do you want something to eat?

42:00.769 --> 42:02.439
I'm harmless.

42:07.860 --> 42:09.450
Fine. I could use some coffee.

42:11.447 --> 42:14.907
If you're a pervert,
I swear, I'll kick your fucking ass.

42:24.960 --> 42:25.960
Here.

42:31.508 --> 42:34.968
- You're the kid with the cool sneakers.
- Yeah.

42:35.054 --> 42:37.144
So, what's wrong with you?

42:38.849 --> 42:42.189
I have, uh... Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

42:43.312 --> 42:45.442
Shit. That sounds bad.

42:45.522 --> 42:48.362
- Can they fix it?
- No. Not yet.

42:48.442 --> 42:50.612
- That fucking blows.
- Yeah.

42:50.694 --> 42:54.204
- Does it hurt?
- No. I mean, kind of.

42:55.240 --> 42:57.830
- Does it affect your brains?
- No.

42:57.910 --> 43:00.660
- Does your penis work?
- You want a menu?

43:00.746 --> 43:03.786
Can we have a menu? What would you like?
You want a sandwich?

43:03.874 --> 43:05.134
You want some eggs maybe?

43:05.209 --> 43:08.669
- The waffles are really good. Right, Trev?
- Yeah.

43:09.254 --> 43:12.174
Yeah, the waffles are good
or, yeah, your penis works?

43:17.012 --> 43:18.642
The waffles suck.

43:22.142 --> 43:24.602
- I'm Dot.
- Trevor.

43:24.686 --> 43:27.396
You two perverts got room for one more?

43:35.364 --> 43:39.084
- So, what's in Denver?
- Starting my life, Mervin.

43:39.159 --> 43:40.659
Maybe go to art school.

43:40.744 --> 43:42.664
My mom always said
Denver was a good place

43:42.746 --> 43:46.286
because the high altitude makes
the air less complicated.

43:46.375 --> 43:47.665
Ah.

43:48.043 --> 43:50.303
- Does your mom know you're hitchhiking?
- No.

43:51.255 --> 43:52.625
Think you should tell her?

43:52.714 --> 43:55.054
She's dead,
so that might be a little difficult.

43:55.134 --> 43:58.144
- Unless you have psychic powers.
- Oh, I'm sorry.

43:58.220 --> 44:01.970
- I'm sorry, too. We're both sorry.
- Oh, it's okay.

44:02.057 --> 44:04.387
Kathy was so fucking rad.

44:04.476 --> 44:06.896
She would do shit for people,

44:06.979 --> 44:09.899
like, without them even asking,
she would just do it.

44:09.982 --> 44:11.209
And then, like, three years ago,

44:11.233 --> 44:14.953
she gets this random blood disease
out of nowhere.

44:15.028 --> 44:17.068
Just bullshit on a stick if you ask me.

44:17.156 --> 44:22.696
Yeah, it's total bullshit. And on a stick.
Like the world's least delicious lollipop.

44:23.996 --> 44:27.036
What about your dad?
Does he know where you are?

44:27.124 --> 44:30.134
No. I left him a note, though.

44:33.755 --> 44:38.925
- What's that? What's wrong?
- Nothing. It's a... It's a dash light.

44:39.011 --> 44:41.561
Where... Where are we?
When's the nearest exit?

44:41.638 --> 44:45.478
No, it's fine, Trevor. I had
the engine serviced. It's okay, Trevor.

44:45.559 --> 44:47.662
Maybe we should just pull over
and see what's... Check just to...

44:47.686 --> 44:49.856
- Just so you can check it over.
- Trevor, it's fine.

44:49.938 --> 44:53.318
Those lights don't mean shit.
Just keep going. Trevor, tell him.

44:54.526 --> 44:55.856
Keep going.

45:00.365 --> 45:02.905
You know what?
Trevor, I know you wanna keep going,

45:02.993 --> 45:05.221
but maybe we should just pull off,
find a place to stay tonight

45:05.245 --> 45:07.405
and then I'll get it checked out
in the morning.

45:07.497 --> 45:11.417
Look, I told his mom I'd keep him safe.
I'm sorry. That's what we're gonna do.

45:13.086 --> 45:18.046
What a fucking pussy.
Why are old people such pussies?

45:18.133 --> 45:23.103
Is it gradual, or one day you just wake up
and you look in the mirror and you say:

45:23.180 --> 45:25.520
"Today I am a giant fucking pussy"?

45:25.599 --> 45:28.349
Yeah, Ben. Why you are such
a giant fucking pussy?

45:28.435 --> 45:30.435
You wanna...?
Should we keep going? We can...

45:30.520 --> 45:33.020
I mean, I'm certainly okay to go,
and it's a bit...

45:33.106 --> 45:34.936
- It's kind of playing with fire...
- No, no.

45:35.025 --> 45:39.485
- You said you wanted stop, so we can stop.
- Yeah, no, let's pull over.

45:41.657 --> 45:42.907
Such a giant pussy.

45:50.457 --> 45:53.037
So, what's the deal
with the deep pit or whatever?

45:53.126 --> 45:54.126
Oh.

45:54.211 --> 45:55.921
In the '70s some scientist dudes

45:56.004 --> 45:58.174
made a little tiny hole six miles
deep straight down,

45:58.256 --> 46:01.716
trying to get to the center of the Earth.
Named it The World's Deepest Pit.

46:01.802 --> 46:03.262
I think I just like the name.

46:04.096 --> 46:06.846
So, your dream is to see a big hole
in the ground?

46:07.808 --> 46:11.848
I've always been an overachiever.
I'm also gonna see my father.

46:13.563 --> 46:15.523
Is your dad a fuck-up, too?

46:15.607 --> 46:18.127
I wouldn't know. He left when I was three,
when I was diagnosed.

46:19.778 --> 46:22.488
That's really bullshit on a stick.

46:23.156 --> 46:25.946
- Why are you seeing him?
- His idea.

46:26.034 --> 46:28.294
Thinks I should forgive him.

46:29.621 --> 46:31.371
I wouldn't forgive him.

46:33.792 --> 46:37.552
- We're being followed.
- What do you mean, we're being followed?

46:37.629 --> 46:40.219
There's a car in the parking lot.
I noticed it around Ritzville.

46:42.384 --> 46:44.224
I told Janet we were going to Salt Lake.

46:44.302 --> 46:46.682
She must have sent someone
with a court order.

46:47.848 --> 46:49.888
- Who's Janet?
- His wife.

46:49.975 --> 46:53.685
Your wife issued a court order
against you? That's great.

46:53.770 --> 46:56.457
She's trying to divorce him as well,
but he won't sign the divorce papers

46:56.481 --> 46:57.771
- because he's a...
- Dude.

46:57.858 --> 47:01.948
Yeah. I can't say.
Solemn bond between us.

47:03.155 --> 47:05.365
- I'll tell you later.
- Okay.

47:09.161 --> 47:12.291
If there's a knock on this door,
no one answers.

47:13.540 --> 47:16.040
If there's a knock
on that door...

47:17.794 --> 47:18.964
I'm going to smoke.

47:22.591 --> 47:25.431
Don't worry, Mervin.
I'll hide in the bushes.

47:29.264 --> 47:30.774
Hi, Mervin.

47:30.849 --> 47:34.389
Shut up, or tomorrow
I'll put your clothes on inside out.

48:08.345 --> 48:09.845
Morning.

48:12.349 --> 48:16.059
I, uh... took the car to a gas station

48:16.144 --> 48:18.404
and it's totally fine.

48:18.855 --> 48:20.565
It's just a fuse.

48:25.654 --> 48:28.164
- Where's Dot?
- She's outside.

48:28.865 --> 48:29.865
You ready?

50:20.518 --> 50:23.478
Hey there, it's Janet.
Please leave a message.

50:24.105 --> 50:26.185
Is this really necessary, huh?

50:26.274 --> 50:28.574
To hire some goon to follow me
across the country?

50:28.652 --> 50:31.452
It's bullshit, Janet. On a stick.

50:32.239 --> 50:34.869
He does that.
He took one of my things the other day.

50:35.742 --> 50:37.622
You know what's bullshit on a stick?

50:37.702 --> 50:40.542
I went 18 years on this planet and
no one ever told me about a Slim Jim.

50:40.580 --> 50:43.040
Humans didn't need to invent
any other food.

50:46.503 --> 50:48.133
Fuck, yeah.

51:09.818 --> 51:11.648
Right? And it's not just me!

51:11.736 --> 51:13.986
I can't piss for you!
Just try it! Concentrate!

51:14.072 --> 51:15.412
What? Put your arm...

51:15.490 --> 51:17.370
- I don't wanna pee.
- Put your arm on the wall.

51:19.286 --> 51:21.746
Pick a number
between one and 3,500.

51:21.830 --> 51:24.290
- Okay, I want three guesses.
- You don't get three guesses.

51:24.374 --> 51:27.424
You get one guess,
between one and 3,500. Go.

51:27.502 --> 51:30.552
Okay, okay, okay.
One thousand, four hundred and fifty-two.

51:31.506 --> 51:33.216
Oh, my God.
No one's ever gotten it before.

51:33.300 --> 51:35.236
- I can't believe you got it.
- Oh, you're so lying right now.

51:35.260 --> 51:37.850
I'm not lying. You got it.
I am flabbergasted.

51:37.929 --> 51:39.115
- Are you serious?
- Good move.

51:39.139 --> 51:40.219
No, I'm not serious.

51:40.307 --> 51:43.137
- Fuck you.
- Yeah, sorry.

51:48.982 --> 51:50.612
Whoa, look at that.

51:55.697 --> 51:57.947
I'm gonna see if she needs some help.

52:03.580 --> 52:06.170
- Hey.
- Hi.

52:06.249 --> 52:08.629
- How's it going there?
- Not good.

52:08.710 --> 52:10.590
I've been looking at all this,

52:10.670 --> 52:14.470
but I don't really know anything
about cars.

52:15.633 --> 52:18.433
I think something might be on fire.

52:19.554 --> 52:23.184
- You want me to call you a tow truck?
- Thanks. Um...

52:23.850 --> 52:29.360
Whew! I can't really afford to fix it.
I probably shouldn't have driven it.

52:30.023 --> 52:32.533
- Where are you headed?
- Grand Island, Nebraska.

52:32.609 --> 52:35.109
Nebraska?
You're driving by yourself to Nebraska?

52:35.195 --> 52:37.315
I'm going to see my mom.

52:37.405 --> 52:38.985
I'm pregnant.

52:39.491 --> 52:41.991
- What's your name?
- Peaches.

52:42.077 --> 52:43.237
I'm Ben.

52:43.828 --> 52:45.458
- Hi.
- Hi.

52:47.374 --> 52:49.754
- Just a second.
- Okay.

52:52.420 --> 52:54.630
Well, her car is shot.

52:55.298 --> 52:57.758
She's heading to Nebraska.

52:57.842 --> 52:59.403
I mean, we could take her
all the way to Salt Lake

52:59.427 --> 53:02.057
and maybe put her on a bus
for the rest of the way.

53:03.014 --> 53:04.854
What is wrong with you?

53:04.933 --> 53:07.693
You don't put a pregnant lady on a bus.

53:07.769 --> 53:09.229
We'll take her the whole way.

53:09.312 --> 53:10.998
Oh, well,
we don't really have that kind of time.

53:11.022 --> 53:14.032
Mervin. She's pregnant.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.860
You sure about this?

53:16.945 --> 53:19.855
- We don't know her.
- No, absolutely. Yeah. It's what we do.

53:19.948 --> 53:21.988
We're a taxicab for America.

53:24.035 --> 53:25.285
He's so much cooler than you.

53:26.788 --> 53:30.788
You hear that?
Handsome and cool.

53:31.668 --> 53:35.088
- I never said handsome.
- Well, pretty sure you did.

53:39.926 --> 53:41.886
So, how pregnant are you, Peaches?

53:42.887 --> 53:47.227
Uh, just a few more weeks
until baby Elton joins the world.

53:47.308 --> 53:50.018
I'm naming him after his father.

53:50.103 --> 53:53.363
- Is Elton's father in Nebraska?
- Afghanistan.

53:53.440 --> 53:56.320
- Really? He's a soldier?
- Yes.

53:56.401 --> 54:00.321
Private First Class, U.S. Army.
Second tour.

54:00.405 --> 54:03.445
He just got deployed again.
It kind of took us all by surprise.

54:03.533 --> 54:06.833
So, I'm scurrying back to Nebraska
to be with my mom.

54:06.911 --> 54:08.806
Did he see any action
when he was there the first time?

54:08.830 --> 54:12.540
Oh, yeah.
But he wouldn't want me talking about it.

54:12.625 --> 54:14.455
Oh, you have to.
It's what you do on the road.

54:14.544 --> 54:17.674
- Dot's already bored us with her story.
- Asshole.

54:17.755 --> 54:19.215
I'm... I'm just kidding.

54:19.299 --> 54:21.719
It's okay.
I kind of have a thing for assholes.

54:21.801 --> 54:23.551
Continue, Peaches.

54:24.095 --> 54:27.635
Okay, well,
he was on a mission with his buddies,

54:27.724 --> 54:30.524
and they got trapped by enemy rebels.

54:30.602 --> 54:33.812
I know he's not one for bragging,
so I probably shouldn't brag on him,

54:33.897 --> 54:35.897
but he saved everybody.

54:35.982 --> 54:38.362
He ran through enemy fire to get help.

54:38.443 --> 54:40.823
Trev, what would you do in that situation?

54:40.904 --> 54:42.914
Oh, I'd most likely shit myself.

54:42.989 --> 54:45.619
And I most likely would
have to clean it up.

54:47.035 --> 54:50.905
- Don't worry about them. They're idiots.
- Oh, okay.

54:50.997 --> 54:53.247
I have to clean him up
when he shits himself.

54:53.333 --> 54:54.333
God.

54:55.960 --> 54:57.710
All right.

54:57.795 --> 55:00.255
Two rooms tonight. We're living large.

55:01.674 --> 55:04.144
Man, I am starving.

55:04.219 --> 55:06.639
I think there's an all-night diner
across the street.

55:06.721 --> 55:07.971
What do you think?

55:08.389 --> 55:10.769
Oh, well, Peaches said she was too tired.

55:11.643 --> 55:14.023
Oh, all right.
Well, I guess it'll be the three of us.

55:14.103 --> 55:16.733
I'm getting a patty melt.
I don't give a shit.

55:17.440 --> 55:19.480
Look, maybe, uh...

55:19.567 --> 55:22.027
Maybe you could be too tired as well.

55:23.238 --> 55:25.158
What? Oh.

55:25.240 --> 55:26.570
Oh, okay.

55:26.658 --> 55:27.948
Wow.

55:28.493 --> 55:30.543
Come a long way since, "mall."

55:31.162 --> 55:34.332
Hey, guys, Peaches is already asleep.
You guys wanna get something to eat?

55:34.958 --> 55:39.208
You know, um... Do you guys mind
maybe just going by yourselves?

55:39.295 --> 55:42.005
I'm pretty beat.
I think there's a place across the street.

55:42.090 --> 55:43.590
Oh.

55:55.061 --> 55:57.651
Oh, come on. How obvious is this?

55:57.730 --> 56:00.000
No, it's not... He's totally...
It's a long... It's been a long day.

56:00.024 --> 56:01.234
Yeah.

56:05.488 --> 56:08.028
Are you asking me on a date?

56:14.247 --> 56:15.617
Yes, I am.

56:20.837 --> 56:22.587
Pick me up next door when you're ready.

56:30.054 --> 56:30.974
Dude!

56:31.055 --> 56:33.595
You were like James Bond there.

56:34.183 --> 56:36.603
That was the most badass thing
I've ever seen in my life.

56:36.686 --> 56:39.226
Come on, man. Give me a...
Give me a little sugar. Give it up.

56:39.314 --> 56:41.875
My people don't high-five.
Trust me, it's worse than the air quotes.

56:41.899 --> 56:44.189
Come on. Don't leave me hanging.

56:45.695 --> 56:49.155
Yeah, no. That... You're...
That was terrible. You were right.

56:54.245 --> 56:56.495
Handsome and cool, Ben.
You got it?

56:56.581 --> 56:57.711
Right.

56:57.790 --> 57:01.090
I'm just gonna give you
your medicines before you go.

57:08.885 --> 57:10.795
- What?
- Nothing.

57:11.638 --> 57:13.218
What do you mean, nothing? What is it?

57:20.313 --> 57:23.153
- Ben, what is it?
- Nothing.

57:24.359 --> 57:25.359
Uh...

57:27.278 --> 57:28.738
Oh, shit.

57:30.156 --> 57:31.156
What?

57:31.699 --> 57:33.159
Uh...

57:35.745 --> 57:37.655
Shi... Shit.

57:37.747 --> 57:39.457
Ben, what the fuck? What is it?

57:40.249 --> 57:41.669
Um...

57:43.252 --> 57:45.962
I think I left your medicines
in the other hotel.

57:46.047 --> 57:48.927
With the C-pap machine.
They were all together.

57:51.052 --> 57:52.722
Oh, fuck.

57:53.388 --> 57:55.138
Are you fucking kidding me?

57:55.223 --> 57:57.563
That's not a face cream, okay?
I need that shit to live.

57:57.642 --> 58:00.812
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know.
It's, um...

58:00.895 --> 58:02.895
Uh... Shit, you know...

58:02.981 --> 58:05.821
- Oh, fuck.
- Listen, it's fine. It's fine, all right?

58:05.900 --> 58:07.940
I'm gonna call a 24-hour pharmacy
and I'm gonna...

58:08.027 --> 58:10.607
No, we're in Podunk U.S.A.
They're not gonna have shit. Oh, fuck.

58:10.697 --> 58:13.657
- I knew one of your spells would kill me.
- No, it's not...

58:13.741 --> 58:16.871
Oh, shit! Shit! Shit! Shit! Shit!

58:16.953 --> 58:18.514
I'm sorry.
Look, I'm really sorry, all right?

58:18.538 --> 58:20.683
- I don't know what happened.
- I know what happened. You're an idiot.

58:20.707 --> 58:22.537
- You're a fucking idiot.
- I'm not.

58:22.625 --> 58:25.285
I'm not, all right? I'm not an idiot.

58:25.378 --> 58:27.878
I'm... hilarious.

58:30.717 --> 58:33.797
Oh... Oh, my hands are numb.

58:34.262 --> 58:35.892
Are you kidding me?

58:36.514 --> 58:41.104
This is when you decide to play the prank?
When I'm about to go on my first date?

58:42.353 --> 58:44.903
I... It just seemed funnier that way.

58:47.692 --> 58:49.072
Agreed.

59:08.337 --> 59:10.797
I told you, I only date assholes.

59:10.882 --> 59:13.682
Yes. And I'm not an asshole.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.863
And since you want an asshole,
my not being an asshole

59:15.887 --> 59:18.365
makes me more of an asshole
than the assholes that you normally date,

59:18.389 --> 59:19.908
because they're giving you
exactly what you want,

59:19.932 --> 59:22.352
whereas I, by not being an asshole,
am not.

59:25.271 --> 59:26.861
Which makes me an asshole.

59:29.233 --> 59:31.243
I can't believe
I actually understood that.

01:00:34.966 --> 01:00:36.336
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:00:36.425 --> 01:00:37.545
I woke up.

01:00:38.427 --> 01:00:40.807
- May I come in?
- Yeah, sure.

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:45.726
I was just, uh...

01:00:45.810 --> 01:00:47.020
Here.

01:00:48.479 --> 01:00:49.479
Thank you.

01:00:58.656 --> 01:01:00.776
They're really sweet.

01:01:01.534 --> 01:01:03.334
Yeah.

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:08.170
Baby's Elton's kicking.
You wanna feel him?

01:01:09.625 --> 01:01:14.545
- Oh, no, thanks, that's... That's okay...
- Oh, come on, he wants to say hi.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:15.800
It's... I don't... I...

01:01:20.303 --> 01:01:21.643
Dot told me about you.

01:01:22.263 --> 01:01:23.513
She did?

01:01:31.898 --> 01:01:34.108
What's it like being a parent?

01:01:37.028 --> 01:01:39.158
Every corny thing you've ever heard
about having a kid

01:01:39.238 --> 01:01:41.658
is completely and utterly true.

01:01:44.827 --> 01:01:47.037
It's the only reason we're here.

01:01:58.841 --> 01:02:02.181
- Hey. See you tomorrow.
- Yeah.

01:02:07.892 --> 01:02:09.602
How was it?

01:02:10.770 --> 01:02:13.060
She didn't let me eat waffles.

01:02:13.940 --> 01:02:16.360
No? What'd you have?

01:02:17.401 --> 01:02:19.241
French toast.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:36.422
Not tonight.

01:02:40.299 --> 01:02:41.549
All right.

01:03:29.265 --> 01:03:30.555
You ready?

01:04:00.004 --> 01:04:01.924
Hi. May I find you a salesman?

01:04:02.298 --> 01:04:05.548
Uh, yeah, my friend here is looking
for Bob Richardson.

01:04:05.634 --> 01:04:06.804
Is he available?

01:04:06.886 --> 01:04:09.386
- Why don't I get you one of our salesmen.
- We need Bob.

01:04:09.764 --> 01:04:10.894
Tell him it's Trevor.

01:04:10.973 --> 01:04:12.993
And if that doesn't jog his memory,
say, "He's in a wheelchair."

01:04:13.017 --> 01:04:15.257
And if that doesn't jog his memory,
say, "He's your son."

01:04:15.311 --> 01:04:18.771
And if that doesn't jog his memory,
say, "You're an enormous dick."

01:04:20.232 --> 01:04:21.942
Actually, just say that anyway.

01:04:24.737 --> 01:04:26.857
I will be right back.

01:04:27.656 --> 01:04:28.906
Okay.

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:39.632
Just give him a chance.

01:04:42.755 --> 01:04:44.045
Right this way.

01:04:44.840 --> 01:04:46.360
Bob will be with you in just a minute.

01:04:58.479 --> 01:05:03.939
Hey, Trevor. This is a... nice surprise.

01:05:04.026 --> 01:05:05.106
Hello.

01:05:06.237 --> 01:05:09.617
So, what brings you to town?

01:05:10.533 --> 01:05:12.453
Yeah, I'm doing some traveling.

01:05:12.535 --> 01:05:14.325
Wow. Great.

01:05:15.079 --> 01:05:17.079
How's your mom doing?

01:05:17.164 --> 01:05:20.584
She's doing great, actually.
She's got a good job at the bank.

01:05:20.668 --> 01:05:22.338
Transferred her here, so...

01:05:23.045 --> 01:05:24.875
Terrific.

01:05:25.423 --> 01:05:30.053
So, what can I do for you today?

01:05:39.770 --> 01:05:43.150
I figured it was about time
I answered these.

01:05:47.027 --> 01:05:48.317
Uh...

01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:52.775
"Dear Trevor."

01:05:55.202 --> 01:05:56.832
Oh...

01:05:57.246 --> 01:05:58.616
What?

01:06:01.167 --> 01:06:05.547
Elsa always wanted me to write you,

01:06:06.297 --> 01:06:09.587
and I didn't think that was a great idea.

01:06:09.675 --> 01:06:11.175
So...

01:06:12.470 --> 01:06:14.890
I'm... I'm sorry.

01:06:15.514 --> 01:06:18.274
Your mom wrote these.

01:06:25.983 --> 01:06:27.403
Okay.

01:06:31.030 --> 01:06:33.070
I think we better go.

01:06:33.157 --> 01:06:35.077
Trevor. Wait.

01:06:43.584 --> 01:06:45.544
Let me give you some money.

01:06:47.046 --> 01:06:52.126
Here. I got 160 bucks on me.

01:06:52.218 --> 01:06:53.718
What do you say?

01:06:55.429 --> 01:06:56.719
Take it.

01:06:57.264 --> 01:06:58.974
I want you to have it.

01:07:37.429 --> 01:07:39.929
Hey. Listen to me.

01:07:42.768 --> 01:07:44.518
Why'd I do that?

01:07:45.604 --> 01:07:47.614
Remember when you said to me
that you'd wipe my ass

01:07:47.690 --> 01:07:49.820
until there was no more shit left on it?

01:07:51.318 --> 01:07:53.738
Well, there is shit. It's all shit.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.740
I'm shit. You're shit. It's everywhere.

01:07:56.824 --> 01:08:01.454
It's the Ben Benjamin Traveling Shit Show
and you're the star.

01:08:04.582 --> 01:08:06.132
I wanna go home.

01:08:07.751 --> 01:08:09.091
Look. Stop, stop.

01:08:10.963 --> 01:08:14.473
Your father's an asshole, all right?
And I'm sorry about that.

01:08:14.550 --> 01:08:17.487
And I'm sorry if I pushed you to see him.
But I didn't make him an asshole.

01:08:17.511 --> 01:08:19.100
He just is one.

01:08:19.805 --> 01:08:22.765
Hey, man, look. I'm just a guy,
you know, trying to get through the day.

01:08:22.850 --> 01:08:24.270
Just like you.

01:08:25.102 --> 01:08:27.982
- I'm trying to help you.
- No, you're not.

01:08:28.606 --> 01:08:30.265
You're not trying to help me.

01:08:30.357 --> 01:08:33.317
This is not about me. It's about you.

01:08:33.402 --> 01:08:35.282
It's all been about you.

01:08:37.698 --> 01:08:41.368
Look, I know that it was hard in there,
but I think you're better off for...

01:08:41.452 --> 01:08:44.792
No, you... Listen, you're not my father.
Okay? You're not my father.

01:08:45.706 --> 01:08:47.206
I know.

01:08:47.291 --> 01:08:48.501
Do you?

01:08:49.167 --> 01:08:52.377
Let me ask you something.
Why'd you become a caregiver?

01:08:53.339 --> 01:08:54.379
I needed a job.

01:08:54.465 --> 01:08:57.925
Well, there are a lot of jobs out there
that don't involve taking care of a kid.

01:08:58.385 --> 01:09:00.845
I didn't know you were a kid
when I went for the interview.

01:09:06.477 --> 01:09:07.767
What do you think...?

01:09:07.853 --> 01:09:10.813
You think I'm looking
for redemption through you?

01:09:10.898 --> 01:09:13.818
You think I want you to fix me?
Is that it?

01:09:16.236 --> 01:09:17.906
My son died.

01:09:18.656 --> 01:09:21.156
You can't fix me.

01:09:23.618 --> 01:09:25.368
And I don't want to.

01:09:25.871 --> 01:09:27.121
Okay?

01:09:27.497 --> 01:09:30.787
So, you keep your problems over there
and I'll keep my problems over here.

01:09:30.876 --> 01:09:35.126
You wipe my ass, and I'll say thank you.
End of fucking story.

01:09:58.362 --> 01:10:01.532
Are we still going to the big pit?

01:10:01.615 --> 01:10:02.865
No.

01:10:08.414 --> 01:10:11.464
- Fine.
- Not fucking fine!

01:10:12.543 --> 01:10:14.213
I have exactly one life.

01:10:14.294 --> 01:10:17.514
And for reasons
I myself don't really understand,

01:10:17.589 --> 01:10:20.629
I now believe that
that life will not be fulfilled

01:10:20.718 --> 01:10:24.258
unless I am standing at the bottom
of the world's deepest pit

01:10:24.346 --> 01:10:26.466
with you two perverts.

01:10:26.557 --> 01:10:28.177
And this beautiful mom-to-be.

01:10:28.267 --> 01:10:30.807
- Oh, thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:10:30.894 --> 01:10:34.194
So, start the car.
We're going to the fucking pit.

01:10:35.190 --> 01:10:36.730
Yay.

01:11:56.563 --> 01:11:58.073
Holy fuck.

01:12:14.289 --> 01:12:15.869
Wow.

01:12:17.960 --> 01:12:21.840
I thought I'd like it 'cause it's lame,
but it's actually pretty cool.

01:12:24.132 --> 01:12:26.052
Let's go to the bottom.

01:12:47.865 --> 01:12:51.695
I'll catch up with you guys, all right?
I left my phone in the car.

01:12:51.785 --> 01:12:54.865
We got Slim Jims, Mervin. We'll be fine.

01:13:14.600 --> 01:13:16.440
I know who you are.

01:13:17.561 --> 01:13:18.561
What?

01:13:19.021 --> 01:13:21.771
Janet didn't send you. Elsa did.

01:13:22.482 --> 01:13:23.782
Who's Elsa?

01:13:24.484 --> 01:13:25.994
Trevor's mom.

01:13:26.737 --> 01:13:29.947
- Who's Trevor?
- What?

01:13:30.032 --> 01:13:32.202
Are you following Peaches?

01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.580
Dorothy.

01:13:36.663 --> 01:13:39.333
- Dot?
- Yeah, I'm her father.

01:13:40.208 --> 01:13:44.248
I mean, who are you? I mean, why...?
Why are you driving my daughter around?

01:13:44.338 --> 01:13:47.668
Hey, man, I didn't ask for any of this.
I'm just taking a kid to Salt Lake.

01:13:47.758 --> 01:13:50.111
I saw your daughter, I bought her a meal,
I gave her a ride.

01:13:50.135 --> 01:13:51.385
I was just trying to be decent.

01:13:52.179 --> 01:13:53.509
Oh.

01:13:54.681 --> 01:13:57.391
Well, I guess I owe you a thanks.

01:13:58.936 --> 01:14:00.396
You don't owe me anything.

01:14:00.479 --> 01:14:02.979
Look, I'm never gonna win
Dad of the Year, okay?

01:14:03.065 --> 01:14:05.225
But I sure as shit wasn't gonna let
my little girl get

01:14:05.317 --> 01:14:07.647
from Olympia to Denver on her own.

01:14:08.487 --> 01:14:13.117
Dorothy and I, we got some issues,
but we're connected, you know?

01:14:13.450 --> 01:14:16.950
Just... Just trying my best here.

01:14:17.913 --> 01:14:19.253
I get it.

01:14:20.999 --> 01:14:22.759
Is it okay if I tail you
the rest of the way?

01:14:22.793 --> 01:14:27.513
I... I won't get in your way, I'm just...
I just wanna make sure she's safe.

01:14:29.049 --> 01:14:30.679
Yeah, sure thing.

01:14:34.054 --> 01:14:35.314
Thanks.

01:14:44.564 --> 01:14:45.484
Hello?

01:14:45.565 --> 01:14:47.775
- Ben! Come downstairs quickly!
- Hello?

01:14:47.859 --> 01:14:50.359
It's me, Dot. It's an emergency!

01:14:50.445 --> 01:14:52.298
- Come... Now!
- What's the matter? What's the...?

01:14:52.322 --> 01:14:53.782
Can you hear me? Hello? Hello?

01:15:10.215 --> 01:15:12.295
- Is there a doctor here?
- How about a nurse?

01:15:12.384 --> 01:15:15.184
- Anyone here a doctor?
- With any kind of medical training?

01:15:15.262 --> 01:15:17.932
- Oh, no!
- She's having the baby.

01:15:18.015 --> 01:15:21.135
- Help.
- I don't... I don't know what to do.

01:15:21.226 --> 01:15:22.636
Please.

01:15:30.318 --> 01:15:31.648
Ben!

01:15:33.905 --> 01:15:35.155
Ben!

01:15:35.949 --> 01:15:37.409
She needs your help! Do something!

01:15:38.535 --> 01:15:42.865
Call 911! Call 911! Call 911!
All right, all right, all right.

01:15:42.956 --> 01:15:45.326
- Here you go, here you go.
- I think something is wrong.

01:15:45.417 --> 01:15:47.687
- Come on, Ben. Do something.
- Okay, okay. All right, all right.

01:15:47.711 --> 01:15:49.761
Something doesn't feel right.

01:17:40.490 --> 01:17:42.700
- Okay, okay.
- Ready, ready, ready?

01:17:59.050 --> 01:18:01.090
My little baby.

01:18:08.476 --> 01:18:10.096
He's here.

01:18:29.164 --> 01:18:30.424
Hi.

01:18:32.500 --> 01:18:34.090
Mmm.

01:18:36.463 --> 01:18:37.593
Thank you, Ben.

01:18:52.854 --> 01:18:54.614
It's a boy. Take a Slim.

01:18:54.689 --> 01:18:57.529
If you haven't had one,
it's the biggest mistake of your life.

01:19:23.551 --> 01:19:24.841
Did you steal this, Cash?

01:19:26.346 --> 01:19:28.966
Please don't call me that.

01:19:33.979 --> 01:19:36.189
Well, how... How did he seem?

01:19:36.898 --> 01:19:40.278
I mean, he seemed okay.

01:19:40.360 --> 01:19:42.780
I think he means well.

01:19:49.119 --> 01:19:51.959
She's... She's coming over. Uh...
Look... Look busy.

01:19:52.038 --> 01:19:54.288
What? Why?
Why do you need to look busy?

01:19:54.374 --> 01:19:56.794
Because of... I don't know. Shh.

01:19:58.169 --> 01:20:00.629
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:20:01.214 --> 01:20:02.304
How is he?

01:20:03.633 --> 01:20:08.013
He's a heaping mess,
but... he's my heaping mess.

01:20:09.264 --> 01:20:11.474
So, are you gonna go back
to Olympia with him?

01:20:11.558 --> 01:20:15.478
No. I'm going to Denver. I just have to.

01:20:15.562 --> 01:20:16.562
But...

01:20:17.689 --> 01:20:19.109
Um...

01:20:19.816 --> 01:20:21.656
I think he's gonna take me
the rest of the way.

01:20:26.573 --> 01:20:29.953
Uh, right now? Are you going...
Are you going right now?

01:20:32.162 --> 01:20:33.292
Yeah.

01:20:36.124 --> 01:20:38.384
Cool. Um... Cool.

01:20:38.877 --> 01:20:42.167
Okay. That's cool. I mean, yeah...

01:20:42.255 --> 01:20:45.085
I'm sure it'll be fine and stuff and...

01:20:45.967 --> 01:20:48.297
You know what? I'm just...

01:20:48.386 --> 01:20:50.926
I'm gonna go talk to Cash for a second.

01:21:04.319 --> 01:21:07.779
You have my number.
You're gonna text me, right?

01:21:10.492 --> 01:21:11.912
Definitely.

01:21:15.372 --> 01:21:17.172
You know what you are?

01:21:24.005 --> 01:21:26.005
Handsome and cool.

01:21:28.093 --> 01:21:29.803
Don't make fun of me.

01:21:31.971 --> 01:21:33.351
I'm not.

01:21:57.997 --> 01:21:59.617
What's wrong with him?

01:22:00.834 --> 01:22:02.384
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy.

01:22:04.254 --> 01:22:06.764
He'll be lucky if he makes it to 30.

01:22:08.466 --> 01:22:09.626
Is it rare?

01:22:11.678 --> 01:22:14.968
It affects one out of every 3,500 males.

01:22:15.348 --> 01:22:16.348
Man...

01:22:18.810 --> 01:22:21.480
Life's a real class-A bitch, isn't it?

01:22:25.316 --> 01:22:26.986
Not always.

01:22:35.243 --> 01:22:38.123
Well, thanks for the coffee, Mervin.

01:22:38.204 --> 01:22:42.334
Well, take care of yourself in Denver.
There are a lot of perverts there.

01:22:42.417 --> 01:22:44.707
Yeah? And how would you know?

01:22:45.587 --> 01:22:47.257
We all keep in touch.

01:24:38.283 --> 01:24:40.033
- Come on.
- What the heck are we doing?

01:24:40.118 --> 01:24:43.578
Would you just do me a favor and
shut the fuck up for once in your life?

01:24:43.663 --> 01:24:45.923
We literally... What is that? What...
What are you doing?

01:24:45.999 --> 01:24:47.959
We're doing something. Come on.

01:25:08.521 --> 01:25:09.811
You ready?

01:25:14.193 --> 01:25:17.663
Get ready for the most spectacular
standing-piss in human history.

01:25:17.739 --> 01:25:20.239
- It's not gonna work. I promise you.
- Oh, it's gonna work.

01:25:20.325 --> 01:25:23.695
All you gotta do is aim and fire.

01:25:23.786 --> 01:25:25.116
I don't know.

01:25:28.916 --> 01:25:29.916
Whoa.

01:25:30.001 --> 01:25:32.751
It's going.
Hang on, I got it, I got it, I got it.

01:25:32.837 --> 01:25:35.007
Yeah!

01:25:35.089 --> 01:25:37.379
Yes!

01:25:42.513 --> 01:25:46.183
Take a look!
I'm peeing standing up! Whoo!

01:26:28.434 --> 01:26:29.734
Hello.

01:26:58.881 --> 01:27:01.841
Trevor Conklin was handsome
and cool.

01:27:05.888 --> 01:27:08.888
Soon after our trip,
I resigned as his caregiver,

01:27:08.975 --> 01:27:11.435
but continued on as his friend.

01:27:12.812 --> 01:27:15.362
Two weeks ago,
when I went to visit Trevor

01:27:15.440 --> 01:27:19.860
on his 21st birthday, I found him
lying on the floor of his bedroom,

01:27:19.944 --> 01:27:21.954
finally at peace.

01:27:28.161 --> 01:27:33.581
The new caregiver, a kind woman
in her 60s named Anna, was sobbing.

01:27:34.208 --> 01:27:36.538
She, like me,

01:27:36.627 --> 01:27:39.047
knew just how special he was.

01:27:51.601 --> 01:27:53.601
He was faking, of course.

01:27:55.438 --> 01:27:57.398
Anna quit the next day.
