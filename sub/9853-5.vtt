00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.048 --> 00:12.473
A new, unopened
box of cereal.

00:12.473 --> 00:15.686
Untouched by my six
grubby siblings.

00:15.686 --> 00:18.269
I'll finally have a bowl
that looks like

00:18.269 --> 00:19.560
the picture on the box.

00:19.560 --> 00:21.642
Fresh bowl, come to Mama.

00:22.733 --> 00:26.407
Pull, Beast, pull.

00:26.407 --> 00:29.410
- What are you doing?
- We're training
to be firemen.

00:29.410 --> 00:32.412
Aren't you a little young,
short and completely unqualified

00:32.412 --> 00:34.575
to fight fires?

00:34.575 --> 00:36.327
There's gonna be
a fire truck at

00:36.327 --> 00:37.658
the neighborhood
block party this year.

00:37.658 --> 00:39.370
If we're gonna
join the squad,

00:39.370 --> 00:40.751
we gotta train hard.

00:40.751 --> 00:44.295
- You call that training?
- Oh, come on.

00:44.295 --> 00:46.717
Never walk away
from the first bowl.

00:46.717 --> 00:49.300
You guys can't
be firemen.

00:49.300 --> 00:51.472
You're too soft.

00:51.472 --> 00:52.673
You call this soft?

00:52.673 --> 00:55.556
- Ow!
- Ow!

00:55.556 --> 00:57.598
Maybe she's right.

00:57.598 --> 00:59.680
Maybe we do
need a trainer.

00:59.680 --> 01:03.354
Someone tough who won't
let up, no matter what.

01:06.527 --> 01:09.530
Oh, you don't want this.

01:09.530 --> 01:11.782
I'll bring the pain.

01:11.782 --> 01:14.455
We'll take whatever pain
you can dish out.

01:14.455 --> 01:16.787
All right then.
It's on.

01:16.787 --> 01:19.500
Move, fire monkeys, move.

01:23.464 --> 01:26.377
Daphne's soggy leftovers
for breakfast.

01:26.377 --> 01:29.380
Eh, wouldn't be the first time.

01:29.380 --> 01:31.552
Sorry the house is
such a mess, Bethany.

01:31.552 --> 01:33.714
It has been a hectic...

01:33.714 --> 01:36.387
This is how it always looks.
Best to keep your shoes on.

01:36.387 --> 01:38.719
I always wear my gardening
shoes when I come here.

01:41.722 --> 01:43.564
So block party time.

01:43.564 --> 01:45.396
Very exciting.

01:45.396 --> 01:47.398
Yep. Time to get
to know the neighbors

01:47.398 --> 01:49.650
I usually only speak to
when their car is
blocking my driveway.

01:49.650 --> 01:52.573
That reminds me.
I need you to move your car.

01:52.573 --> 01:54.535
It's not blocking anything,
it's just an eyesore.

01:54.535 --> 01:57.578
Anyway, I've got you down
for your usual assignment.

01:57.578 --> 01:59.370
Water station.
Got it.

01:59.370 --> 02:01.372
No one hands out
water bottles like us.

02:01.372 --> 02:03.624
Uh, Mom, can you please
grab me the peanut butter?

02:09.590 --> 02:11.462
I don't wanna hand out
water bottles again.

02:11.462 --> 02:12.713
It's a nothing job.

02:12.713 --> 02:14.675
The year we had the flu,
they replaced us

02:14.675 --> 02:16.637
with a tub of ice.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.809
So are you saying
we should do nothing?

02:18.809 --> 02:20.601
Because if you think
we can get away with it

02:20.601 --> 02:23.524
- I'm all for it.
- No. We should do more.

02:23.524 --> 02:25.606
We should be in charge
of the big activity.

02:25.606 --> 02:27.688
The Callahans
do the big activity every year

02:27.688 --> 02:30.441
and they nail it--
water slides, bounce houses.

02:30.441 --> 02:32.483
But they moved
to Alaska.

02:32.483 --> 02:33.774
This opening may
never come again.

02:33.774 --> 02:35.696
It's all about timing, Mom.

02:35.696 --> 02:38.539
Hey, guys.
Got any pretzels?

02:41.542 --> 02:43.784
Don't you wanna ask us
why we're in here?

02:43.784 --> 02:45.706
Not unless it affects you
handing me the pretzels.

02:48.459 --> 02:51.672
Harley, doing
the big activity
is way too risky.

02:51.672 --> 02:54.675
Everybody on the block
already thinks our family's
a train wreck.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.637
Have you seen Daphne?

02:59.560 --> 03:02.393
This is our chance to
change our reputation.

03:02.393 --> 03:04.515
I can bring the wow factor.

03:04.515 --> 03:07.688
And I don't mean the
"Wow, the Diazes

03:07.688 --> 03:10.611
still have their Christmas
lights up in July" factor.

03:10.611 --> 03:12.653
Sorry, Harley, we need to
just play it safe.

03:12.653 --> 03:15.576
Now follow me out
and act normal.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.819
And that, Harley,
is the difference

03:18.819 --> 03:20.781
between creamy
and crunchy peanut butter.

03:20.781 --> 03:22.663
Always teaching.

03:22.663 --> 03:24.825
I just thought you were
trying to avoid me.

03:24.825 --> 03:26.667
But based on the havoc
I'm seeing in there,

03:26.667 --> 03:29.750
it's entirely plausible
you got trapped.

03:29.750 --> 03:32.503
Ms. Peters?

03:32.503 --> 03:34.885
I'm must curious.

03:34.885 --> 03:36.837
Who's doing the activity
this year?

03:36.837 --> 03:38.929
Wait.

03:38.929 --> 03:41.802
You're thinking...
the activity?

03:41.802 --> 03:43.554
For the block party?

03:43.554 --> 03:44.845
This family?

03:47.518 --> 03:48.769
I'm not sure
why that's so funny.

03:48.769 --> 03:51.732
That's what makes it funny.

03:51.732 --> 03:54.445
As a mother of
 seven kids,

03:54.445 --> 03:56.777
it takes a lot to push
 my mom's buttons.

03:56.777 --> 03:59.450
But the one that puts her
 over the edge...

03:59.450 --> 04:01.702
laughing at her family.

04:01.702 --> 04:05.746
Mom's gonna lose it in
three, two, one.

04:05.746 --> 04:08.829
You can stop laughing
because the Diaz family
is doing the activity,

04:08.829 --> 04:10.671
and we're gonna
knock it out of the park.

04:10.671 --> 04:11.962
I mean, block.

04:11.962 --> 04:13.874
You know what I mean.

04:13.874 --> 04:16.966
Generous offer, but you
better stick to your strengths.

04:16.966 --> 04:20.511
Water, hand,
water, hand.

04:20.511 --> 04:22.683
It's not an offer.
We're doing it.

04:22.683 --> 04:24.555
Yeah!

04:28.519 --> 04:30.891
- What did we just do?
- Don't worry, Mom.

04:30.891 --> 04:33.734
We're gonna set
this block party on fire.

04:33.734 --> 04:35.896
Fire? Where?
Somebody do something.

04:35.896 --> 04:37.898

I just put
our family's reputation

05:36.877 --> 05:38.879
in front of
a one-woman firing squad.

05:38.879 --> 05:41.051
If I'm going to think of
an awesome activity

05:41.051 --> 05:44.725
for the party, I have to have
something I've never had before.

05:44.725 --> 05:47.638
Quiet.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.730
- No way. No way!
- ( music playing loudly )

05:49.730 --> 05:50.971
No way!

05:50.971 --> 05:52.893
You're kidding!

05:52.893 --> 05:54.895
( laughter )

05:54.895 --> 05:57.858
For a project
this big,

05:57.858 --> 06:00.981
I gotta find a place where
my family won't be in the way.

06:00.981 --> 06:03.864
( screaming )

06:03.864 --> 06:05.866
Not there.

06:08.579 --> 06:09.990
Thank you for coming
to my tea party.

06:09.990 --> 06:13.624
One of you has been served
an odorless poison.

06:13.624 --> 06:15.045
Who will it be?

06:17.918 --> 06:19.840
Definitely not there.

06:22.713 --> 06:24.675
Oh, hi, Harley.

06:24.675 --> 06:27.808
Mom sent me over
to try to find out
what your activity is.

06:27.808 --> 06:29.970
Is it bobbing for socks?
Looks super fun.

06:29.970 --> 06:33.934
No. I was just looking
for a quiet place to think.

06:33.934 --> 06:36.687
But this is more stink
than think.

06:36.687 --> 06:38.649
I have too much
quiet time.

06:38.649 --> 06:39.940
Sometimes I go in my closet

06:39.940 --> 06:42.112
and pretend the coats
are my big family.

06:42.112 --> 06:44.114
The trenchcoat
is my big brother,

06:44.114 --> 06:45.946
the parka's my cousin,

06:45.946 --> 06:47.788
and the poncho is
my fun little brother.

06:50.030 --> 06:52.032
I love
family game night.

06:52.032 --> 06:54.915
Your turn, Poncho.

06:54.915 --> 06:57.628
I have an idea.

07:05.636 --> 07:07.718
This is it.
It's perfect.

07:07.718 --> 07:09.890
Tell me
what we're seeing.

07:09.890 --> 07:11.101
I want to be
as excited as you.

07:11.101 --> 07:13.684
Ellie, I'm seeing
the place

07:13.684 --> 07:16.016
where I'm going to think
of an activity so awesome,

07:16.016 --> 07:18.649
your mom's head
is going to explode.

07:18.649 --> 07:19.900
No offense.

07:19.900 --> 07:23.734
None taken.
I've imagined it many times.

HARLEY: Now this is living.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.965
Now that I have
my quiet space,

07:44.965 --> 07:47.678
I'm going to think of
something great,

07:47.678 --> 07:49.760
because silence is golden.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.762
And so am I.

07:51.762 --> 07:55.686
Awesome activity.

07:57.728 --> 07:59.019

08:50.070 --> 08:51.992
What happened here?

08:51.992 --> 08:54.154
Where did
Harley's stuff go?

08:54.154 --> 08:57.077
Why does our room look like
Katy Perry's tour bus?

08:57.077 --> 08:58.919
Oh good, that's what
I was going for.

08:58.919 --> 09:00.831
You can't just decide
you get Harley's space.

09:00.831 --> 09:02.162
That's not fair.

09:02.162 --> 09:04.214
You're right.
Let's take a vote.

09:04.214 --> 09:07.047
Hey, squad, is this fair?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.800
- GIRLS: Totally.
 - The totallys have it.

09:09.800 --> 09:11.221
Yeah, well,
I've got people, too.

09:11.221 --> 09:13.844
Should I get half the room?

09:15.846 --> 09:18.178
Not cool, guys.

09:22.943 --> 09:24.815
Stay calm, ma'am.

09:24.815 --> 09:26.897
The fire department
is here.

09:26.897 --> 09:29.189
( falsetto )
Save my baby.

09:29.189 --> 09:31.151
Save Honey Maple.

09:31.151 --> 09:33.904
It's all right.
I've got him.

09:33.904 --> 09:37.117
He's my only child.
He's all I have.

09:37.117 --> 09:40.000
Dude, you're making me
not wanna rescue you

09:40.000 --> 09:41.912
or your ham baby.

09:41.912 --> 09:44.795
- ( whistle blows )
- Ten seconds!

09:44.795 --> 09:46.917
That ham would be
bacon by now.

09:46.917 --> 09:49.009
Guys, I just told you.

09:49.009 --> 09:51.011
No more rescuing
the deli meats.

09:51.011 --> 09:53.173
You said no,
she said yes.

09:53.173 --> 09:55.175
She's scarier.

09:55.175 --> 09:57.177
And she makes us
do push-ups.

09:57.177 --> 09:59.059
What is this,
a talk show?

09:59.059 --> 10:01.221
- Drop and give me ten.
- ( both groan )

10:01.221 --> 10:03.143
You know what? 20.

10:06.987 --> 10:09.229
And yet, I can't get you
to rake the leaves.

10:09.229 --> 10:12.232
- Rake the leaves
when you get home.
- Thanks, Daphne.

10:23.083 --> 10:26.006
Now I have no ideas
and no pencils.

10:27.087 --> 10:28.248
Harley.

10:30.250 --> 10:32.092
Mom and I are really glad
you convinced us

10:32.092 --> 10:33.884
to take a risk
this year.

10:33.884 --> 10:35.135
We'll show Bethany.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.097
I want us all dressed
for the big moment,

10:37.097 --> 10:38.929
so I made these
for everybody.

10:38.929 --> 10:42.102
"Team Diaz.
We nail activity."

10:42.102 --> 10:44.104
I wanted it to say
"How'd you like us now?"

10:44.104 --> 10:45.936
but Mom felt
it was enabling.

10:45.936 --> 10:47.317
This is the year
the Diaz family

10:47.317 --> 10:49.269
turns it around.

10:49.269 --> 10:51.111
Yeah, how you
like us now?

10:51.111 --> 10:52.272
Tom, please, stop.

10:58.238 --> 11:00.871
Stop staring at me.

11:08.338 --> 11:11.171
Okay, it's still in
the testing phase,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.213
but I want you two to be
the first to see

11:13.213 --> 11:16.006
my block party activity.
Be honest with me.

11:16.006 --> 11:17.297
Stop downplaying it.

11:17.297 --> 11:20.220
We already know
it's going to be awesome.

11:20.220 --> 11:22.893
It's called
the bounce fly.

11:25.395 --> 11:27.938
Uh...

11:27.938 --> 11:30.150
that's a trampoline.
P.S.

11:30.150 --> 11:31.311
Not a great one.

11:31.311 --> 11:33.984
No, this is
a bounce fly.

11:33.984 --> 11:37.077
On a trampoline, you jump.
There's no jumping here.

11:37.077 --> 11:39.319
Just bouncing.
And flying.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.321
She's messing with us.

11:41.321 --> 11:44.164
This is the razzle
before the dazzle.

11:44.164 --> 11:45.325
Show us the activity.

11:45.325 --> 11:46.416
I'll do the "ta-da."

11:46.416 --> 11:48.208
Ta-da!

11:48.208 --> 11:51.421
- Ta-da!
- Ta-da?

11:51.421 --> 11:54.174
I gotta go.

11:54.174 --> 11:57.097
When I tell Poncho,
he'll be devastated.

11:57.097 --> 11:59.339
This is a bounce fly.

11:59.339 --> 12:02.102
Calling it a trampoline
is insulting.

12:02.102 --> 12:04.975
Oh, cool.
A trampoline.

12:04.975 --> 12:06.186
Not a trampoline.

12:06.186 --> 12:08.228
Who cares?
We need a break.

12:08.228 --> 12:10.310
I'll break you.

12:10.310 --> 12:13.984
Get moving, or I'll
flip you like a pancake.

12:13.984 --> 12:16.316
What have I done?
I can't tell Mom

12:16.316 --> 12:18.448
I staked our family's
reputation

12:18.448 --> 12:20.951
on a knock-off trampoline.

12:20.951 --> 12:23.123
Look, let me
handle this.

12:23.123 --> 12:26.456
You're not used to
quitting things,
but I am.

12:26.456 --> 12:29.329
Right now, I'm
supposed to be at karate.

12:31.131 --> 12:32.963
So I bought
this pink shirt for school.

12:32.963 --> 12:34.464
GIRL: Love it.

12:34.464 --> 12:37.177
This pink shirt
for the concert.

12:37.177 --> 12:39.139
Oh, that's so pretty.

12:39.139 --> 12:41.381
And this pink shirt
to go buy other pink shirts.

12:41.381 --> 12:43.303
( squad laughing )

12:43.303 --> 12:45.385
What's so funny?

12:45.385 --> 12:47.147
( screams )

12:49.149 --> 12:50.390
Take that down.

12:50.390 --> 12:52.482
When you give me
my half of the room back.

12:52.482 --> 12:55.105
Until then, go ahead.
Rip it down.

12:55.105 --> 12:57.107
I've got more where
that came from.

12:57.107 --> 12:58.398
Night guard Rachel,

12:58.398 --> 13:00.160
runny nose Rachel.

13:00.160 --> 13:02.242
Wisdom tooth Rachel.

13:02.242 --> 13:03.493
No one looks good
after oral surgery.

13:03.493 --> 13:05.205
This is so unfair.

13:05.205 --> 13:07.457
Is it?
Let's take a vote.

13:07.457 --> 13:10.080
Is this unfair?

13:12.332 --> 13:15.295
That's right.
I figured it out.

13:15.295 --> 13:18.088
Yay! Bye.

13:18.088 --> 13:21.051
Mom, we need to talk
about the block party.

13:21.051 --> 13:22.342
- Interesting.
- ( Ethan screams )

13:22.342 --> 13:25.015
I was just going to
talk about the same thing.

13:25.015 --> 13:27.137
I didn't know
Ms. Peters was here.

13:27.137 --> 13:29.099
Neither did I.

13:29.099 --> 13:31.431
I guess I was camouflaged
by all the clutter.

13:31.431 --> 13:34.434
Anyway...
good news.

13:34.434 --> 13:36.276
The neighbors heard you were
stuck doing activity,

13:36.276 --> 13:38.438
so they pitched in
to fly the Callahans back.

13:38.438 --> 13:40.400
So you're off the hook.
Yay!

13:40.400 --> 13:42.282
We don't wanna be
off the hook.

13:42.282 --> 13:44.244
I made shirts,

13:44.244 --> 13:46.366
and we're gonna nail
the activity. Nail it.

13:46.366 --> 13:50.410
Yes. Nothing says competence
like T-shirt humor.

13:50.410 --> 13:53.213
Mom, maybe it's for
the best.

13:53.213 --> 13:55.215
We don't wanna upset
the Callahans.

13:55.215 --> 13:56.456
They've traveled so far.

13:56.456 --> 13:58.458
- Franklin is right.
- I'm Ethan.

13:58.458 --> 14:00.550
- Which one's Franklin.
- There is no Franklin.

14:00.550 --> 14:03.263
Are you sure? How can
you even keep track?

14:03.263 --> 14:05.345
You always have
so much on your plate.

14:05.345 --> 14:08.138
And yet,
never cook dinner.

14:08.138 --> 14:10.060
I just thought of that.

14:16.146 --> 14:18.188
- So how'd it go?
- Well...

14:18.188 --> 14:20.070
Back it up, woman.

14:20.070 --> 14:22.362
The Diaz family
is doing the activity,

14:22.362 --> 14:24.324
and we're gonna
nail it into the ground.

14:24.324 --> 14:27.197
- How do you like us now?
- Hey!

14:27.197 --> 14:28.538
Mom doubled down on you.

14:28.538 --> 14:30.490
I'm really sorry.

14:30.490 --> 14:34.294
Don't be.
This is a sign.

14:34.294 --> 14:36.416
This is the universe saying,

14:36.416 --> 14:38.548
"Harley,
you can't give up.

14:38.548 --> 14:40.500
You're not a quitter
like your brother Ethan."

14:40.500 --> 14:42.422
I'm not always
a quitter.

14:42.422 --> 14:44.594
Sometimes I don't
even start things.

14:44.594 --> 14:47.427
Well, it's time I start.

14:47.427 --> 14:49.509
So step back.

14:49.509 --> 14:52.182
I'm about to unleash
the Harley.

14:55.355 --> 14:57.357
I've got an idea
for the activity.

14:57.357 --> 14:59.319
I was overthinking it.

14:59.319 --> 15:01.521
The trick was
to keep it simple.

15:01.521 --> 15:04.364
We're just going to need
14 water beds,

15:04.364 --> 15:06.196
fifty pounds of concrete,
and a taco.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.118
The taco is key, Ethan.

15:10.240 --> 15:12.332
It's what we'll eat when
we're in the getaway car.

15:12.332 --> 15:17.207
Okay, you are literally
tangled in your own ideas.

15:17.207 --> 15:19.209
What's wrong with you?

15:19.209 --> 15:21.211
Good ideas used to
just pop out.

15:21.211 --> 15:23.463
Now, somehow,
the taco is key.

15:23.463 --> 15:26.466
What is wrong with me?

15:26.466 --> 15:29.509
Just last week, I came up
with something fantastic.

15:29.509 --> 15:31.511
They're my yoga pants.

15:31.511 --> 15:33.513
No, they're mine.

15:35.475 --> 15:38.398
And that's when I thought of
my detachable pant legs,

15:38.398 --> 15:41.521
or as I call them,
Detach-a-pants.

15:41.521 --> 15:43.323
How'd I miss this?

15:43.323 --> 15:46.326
I'm the middle kid
in a huge family.

15:46.326 --> 15:48.568
My body rejects
peace and quiet.

15:48.568 --> 15:51.411
I thrive in chaos.

15:51.411 --> 15:54.164
The taco isn't the key.

15:54.164 --> 15:56.576
It's chaos.
Cut me out of here, Ethan.

15:56.576 --> 15:59.209
I'm going back
to my old room.

16:01.251 --> 16:02.502
BOTH: No.

16:12.222 --> 16:13.433
It's our room now.
You can't move back in.

16:13.433 --> 16:16.306
It's not only
up to you. Georgie?

16:16.306 --> 16:19.439
I can't go back now.
Plus, we have a system.

16:19.439 --> 16:21.521
Oh, right. Georgie,
Mondays, Wednesdays
and Fridays

16:21.521 --> 16:23.363
- I open the door.
- My mistake.

16:27.237 --> 16:29.409
Besides, do you think
we're gonna let you back in

16:29.409 --> 16:31.321
after how you left us?

16:31.321 --> 16:34.284
So long, suckas!

16:34.284 --> 16:37.287
The H train is pulling out
of Lame Town,

16:37.287 --> 16:41.291
and I am never
coming back. Losers!

16:41.291 --> 16:43.503
Chug-chug-chug-chug.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.545
Chug-chug-chug.

16:45.545 --> 16:47.587
( voice echoing )
Losers!

16:51.391 --> 16:54.474
The H train shouldn't
have made that extra
stop in Cocky-ville.

16:54.474 --> 16:58.398
Yeah, that train has
a tendency to burn its bridges.

16:58.398 --> 17:00.690
You are never
getting back in there.

17:00.690 --> 17:04.523
Harley, we've never
asked you for anything before.

17:04.523 --> 17:05.694
Total lie.
Go ahead.

17:05.694 --> 17:09.279
The hard work,
the constant stress,

17:09.279 --> 17:11.570
it's something no fireman
should have to deal with.

17:11.570 --> 17:14.493
We don't even wanna be
firemen anymore.

17:14.493 --> 17:16.616
But she won't
let us quit.

17:16.616 --> 17:18.617
You've gotta get her
off our backs.

17:18.617 --> 17:22.422
She even moved
her playhouse into our room.

17:22.422 --> 17:24.464
She's driving us bananas!

17:24.464 --> 17:26.336
No, we like bananas.

17:26.336 --> 17:29.469
She's driving us tofu.

17:29.469 --> 17:31.761
Boys.

17:31.761 --> 17:33.673
I gotcha covered.

17:33.673 --> 17:35.675
Tell Daphne
to start packing.

17:35.675 --> 17:37.437
She's got a new address.

17:42.772 --> 17:44.484
Who let her in?

17:44.484 --> 17:47.487
There was free space;
I'm moving in.

17:50.490 --> 17:52.532
- My makeup bag.
- What are you doing?

17:52.532 --> 17:54.364
Making some room.

17:54.364 --> 17:55.615
My makeup!

17:56.786 --> 17:59.289
That makeup
was a waste of space.

17:59.289 --> 18:01.621
- Boys are icky.
- Make it stop.

18:01.621 --> 18:04.334
Wish I could, but
as long as there's space,

18:04.334 --> 18:06.506
she's going to stay.

18:06.506 --> 18:10.630
I mean, if there was
a bed or say,
an invention desk,

18:10.630 --> 18:12.762
Daph-nado could blow
back out to the hall.

18:14.424 --> 18:16.596
Wait. Are those
my bobbles?

18:16.596 --> 18:19.639
World's lamest dolls.
Bye-bye.

18:19.639 --> 18:21.481
My bobbles!

18:27.487 --> 18:28.608
I've got it.

18:30.650 --> 18:34.444
I've never been so relieved
 to have a huge, crazy family.

18:34.444 --> 18:37.657
I thought I'd get things done
 despite them.

18:37.657 --> 18:40.410
Turns out, I get things done
because of them.

19:03.643 --> 19:05.765
Awesome ride, Harley.

19:07.687 --> 19:09.609
We did it, Diazes.

19:09.609 --> 19:12.612
Consider me
razzled and dazzled.

19:12.612 --> 19:15.615
I can't wait to ride it.

19:19.489 --> 19:23.543
Thank you, everybody, for
helping me put this together.

19:23.543 --> 19:25.455
- You did it.
- Oh, come on.

19:25.455 --> 19:27.587
No, I couldn't have done this
without you guys.

19:27.587 --> 19:29.839
And half of my inventory.

19:29.839 --> 19:32.592
You're amazing, Harley.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.674
Just like the shirt says.
You nailed it.

19:34.674 --> 19:36.556
All right,
you can say it.

19:36.556 --> 19:38.798
How do you like us now?

19:38.798 --> 19:42.432
Kudos. So you made
an activity for the block.

19:42.432 --> 19:44.474
Well, not actually
on the block.

19:44.474 --> 19:47.647
More in the woods behind it,
but you know, it's something.

19:47.647 --> 19:49.569
Ellie, out of line.
Out!

19:49.569 --> 19:52.862
( groaning )

19:52.862 --> 19:54.864
You have a bunch of kids.

19:54.864 --> 19:56.696
You can afford
to put them on that.

19:56.696 --> 19:59.489
You might wanna tend to
the water station.

19:59.489 --> 20:01.451
It's looking
a little low.

20:01.451 --> 20:03.703
And if you're getting tired,
we can bring in a tub of ice.

20:06.586 --> 20:07.877
Yes!

20:07.877 --> 20:10.500
Thank you for giving me
a fist bump, Harley.

20:10.500 --> 20:12.752
I don't get many in life.

20:12.752 --> 20:14.884
The Diaz family is finally
gonna get some respect.

20:18.838 --> 20:21.511
She couldn't give me
five seconds.

20:21.511 --> 20:26.726
♪ ♪

20:29.689 --> 20:31.851
Hey, Dad, I wanted
to have a little chat.

20:31.851 --> 20:33.693
It's about your smack talk.

20:33.693 --> 20:35.525
How you like me now?

20:35.525 --> 20:36.946
I'm just not feeling it.

20:36.946 --> 20:39.699
I can help. I'm kind of
an expert on smack talk.

20:39.699 --> 20:42.452
I'd prove it by throwing
some "Yo mamas,"

20:42.452 --> 20:45.665
but yo mama is abuela,
 and that woman is a saint.

20:45.665 --> 20:47.577
For raising your lazy butt.

20:47.577 --> 20:49.789
- Oh! Gotcha anyway!
- So what am I doing wrong?

20:49.789 --> 20:52.712
Every word sounds the same.
Try punching one.

20:52.712 --> 20:54.544
How ya like me now?

20:54.544 --> 20:56.636
Mm, no.
Try the last word.

20:56.636 --> 20:57.837
How ya like me now?

20:57.837 --> 20:59.639
Ooh, that is better.

20:59.639 --> 21:02.512
The other thing,
big-time athletes

21:02.512 --> 21:03.883
always talk about themselves
in the third person.

21:03.883 --> 21:05.935
How ya like Tom now?

21:05.935 --> 21:08.518
Yeah, now it sounds like
you're asking for approval.

21:08.518 --> 21:10.730
Powerful people don't
need approval, Dad.

21:10.730 --> 21:12.482
They take it.
Take your power.

21:12.482 --> 21:14.814
Like Tom now!

21:14.814 --> 21:17.817
Yeah, people, now that is
what I'm talking about.

21:17.817 --> 21:19.699
- Thanks, hon.
- Yes.

21:19.699 --> 21:22.782
- Hey, guys.
- Like Tom now!

21:25.575 --> 21:27.907
I did before.
I don't know about now.

21:27.907 --> 21:30.580
Okay, Mom, we have to
work on your smack talk.

21:30.580 --> 21:32.502
Have a sit.
