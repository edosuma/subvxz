01:41.333 --> 01:43.958
( thunder rumbling,
streetcar bell ringing )

01:48.583 --> 01:51.125
What you doing here?

01:52.958 --> 01:56.125
Waiting.

01:56.125 --> 01:58.125
On your man?

01:58.125 --> 02:00.583
For business.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.916
What kind of business
you got in a cathouse?

02:02.916 --> 02:04.291
My business.

02:04.291 --> 02:07.333
You need to go.

02:07.333 --> 02:08.583
Now!

02:08.583 --> 02:10.708
( rain pattering )

02:18.916 --> 02:20.166
She's not his.

02:22.291 --> 02:23.041
Then whose?

02:23.041 --> 02:25.916
Just mine.

02:25.916 --> 02:27.541
( knock at door )

02:29.291 --> 02:30.708
- Clarence: Ma'am?
- Yes?

02:33.250 --> 02:35.291
- Why you lock the door?
- I was changing.

02:35.291 --> 02:38.000
- Been in these clothes
for three days.
- There's rooms for that.

02:38.000 --> 02:40.541
Daughter:
My girl's asleep.
I can't leave her.

02:40.541 --> 02:44.250
Clarence:
Heard from the doctor.

02:44.250 --> 02:46.375
Yes?

02:46.375 --> 02:50.041
He'll come by.
Unlock this when you done.

02:51.750 --> 02:52.916
I will.

03:02.875 --> 03:05.208
Walk out.

03:05.208 --> 03:07.375
While you can.

03:21.333 --> 03:23.791
Let's both see him.

03:27.875 --> 03:29.750
( band playing )

03:29.750 --> 03:31.833
( man coughing )

03:36.916 --> 03:39.083
Man:
Shake it over here!

03:40.416 --> 03:41.750
( man belches )

03:52.208 --> 03:54.666
- I'm awake.
- I ain't.

03:54.666 --> 03:56.375
This kind of night...

03:56.375 --> 03:58.291
it's like the clock's
running backwards.

03:58.291 --> 04:00.166
The middle of the week's
always slow.

04:00.166 --> 04:01.750
Mmm.

04:01.750 --> 04:02.958
Look who's the expert now.

04:02.958 --> 04:05.250
Pretty soon you'll be
running the joint.

04:05.250 --> 04:07.708
( chuckles )
I don't know about that.

04:07.708 --> 04:09.333
What I was doing,
I was your age?

04:09.333 --> 04:10.291
Knocking over storefronts
with a little Pocket Colt.

04:10.291 --> 04:13.958
Pow-pow.
( laughs )

04:13.958 --> 04:16.000
My own gang,
16 years old.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.041
People respected me.
I was going places.

04:18.041 --> 04:19.291
What happened?

04:20.500 --> 04:22.291
Your father set me up
with your mother.

04:22.291 --> 04:25.541
- Wait.
What did... he what?
- Nothing.

04:25.541 --> 04:28.333
I'm sure they're in
the front pew every Sunday.

04:28.333 --> 04:30.166
( yawns )

04:31.541 --> 04:33.125
Off your ass.

04:33.125 --> 04:34.958
Fetch 'em up
the sandwiches.

04:36.833 --> 04:38.750
And don't forget
the pickups later.

04:40.666 --> 04:42.750
( distant music
playing )

04:46.375 --> 04:47.583
( knocks )

05:06.666 --> 05:07.666
( clicks )

05:10.875 --> 05:13.083
Just brought
the sandwiches.

05:20.083 --> 05:21.000
( knocks )

05:21.000 --> 05:23.416
Señor.

05:24.916 --> 05:26.500
Las medianoches.

05:28.250 --> 05:30.416
The food...?

05:41.833 --> 05:43.708
Me cago en Dios.

05:43.708 --> 05:45.750
Where did he go?

05:52.416 --> 05:55.291
( thumping )

05:55.291 --> 05:57.583
( faint clanking,
clattering )

06:23.791 --> 06:25.750
( sighs )

06:26.875 --> 06:28.291
What are you doing?

06:28.291 --> 06:30.750
Strawberry pie.

06:30.750 --> 06:32.333
Leave it
for the morning.

06:32.333 --> 06:35.000
They're starting
to turn.

06:39.166 --> 06:42.583
You came in late.

06:42.583 --> 06:44.458
I couldn't
get out of there.

06:44.458 --> 06:47.625
It was just
speech after speech.

06:47.625 --> 06:50.583
- Did you make one?
- I had to.

06:50.583 --> 06:52.125
What did you say?

06:52.125 --> 06:53.875
( sighs )

06:53.875 --> 06:55.750
"Respected gentlemen
of the hall,

06:55.750 --> 06:57.500
Mr. Mayor,
Commodore Kaestner"...

06:57.500 --> 06:58.875
Mm-hmm.

06:58.875 --> 07:00.583
"I regard it
as both a duty
and a privilege"

07:00.583 --> 07:02.416
to put forward a man

07:02.416 --> 07:05.583
whose energy
is unquenchable,

07:05.583 --> 07:07.916
whose character
is unimpeachable,

07:07.916 --> 07:09.291
"whose loyalty
is inexhaustible."

07:09.291 --> 07:11.875
A nice construction.

07:11.875 --> 07:13.708
"The next Alderman
on the Fourth Ward"

07:13.708 --> 07:16.916
and boon companion
of my youthful years,

07:16.916 --> 07:20.041
"the Honorable
James Patrick Neary."

07:22.083 --> 07:24.041
The thing is,

07:24.041 --> 07:28.041
I've always considered him
a real son of a sailor.

07:28.041 --> 07:30.250
As long as you made
a strong impression.

07:30.250 --> 07:31.958
Everyone kept
calling me Nucky.

07:31.958 --> 07:34.208
- Oh, no.
- Mm-hmm.

07:36.583 --> 07:37.750
( Southern accent )
My name's Nucky, boys.

07:37.750 --> 07:41.416
I'm in ladies' garters.
What's your line?

07:41.416 --> 07:44.333
Say, have yourself
a "see-gar."

07:44.333 --> 07:45.666
Is that what
it sounds like?

07:53.208 --> 07:54.791
( gasps )

07:54.791 --> 07:56.458
What's wrong?

07:57.625 --> 07:59.791
You nauseous again?

08:00.708 --> 08:03.000
Should I fetch
the doctor?

08:04.208 --> 08:06.625
I just couldn't sleep.

08:14.750 --> 08:16.375
I sat at that dinner

08:16.375 --> 08:18.875
and watched them slap
Jim Neary on the back.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.791
They'll make him alderman

08:20.791 --> 08:23.916
because that's what
the Commodore wants.

08:25.583 --> 08:28.208
13 years
I've served him.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.416
Never even
says my name.

08:29.416 --> 08:31.375
You'll be recognized.

08:31.375 --> 08:33.166
- He'll see you're working...
- It doesn't matter.

08:33.166 --> 08:35.957
I have you.

08:37.457 --> 08:38.666
I'm gonna be a father.

08:40.875 --> 08:42.416
I'll make my way.

08:43.875 --> 08:45.875
I know what
I'm doing it for.

08:49.875 --> 08:50.750
( Southern accent )
How-de-do, fellas?

08:50.750 --> 08:53.333
Have yourselves
a "see-gar."

08:53.333 --> 08:54.708
( laughs )

08:59.041 --> 09:01.708
( distant music
playing )

09:05.958 --> 09:07.375
I don't like
cigarettes.

09:07.375 --> 09:10.875
Pissy little
girlie smokes.

09:10.875 --> 09:13.083
Cigarettes.
Drinks with fruit.

09:13.083 --> 09:14.791
Darling handbags.
Lavender soap.

09:14.791 --> 09:17.916
All that cunty shit.

09:17.916 --> 09:18.625
Why don't you
tell me your name?

09:23.958 --> 09:26.541
Francis X. Bushman.

09:26.541 --> 09:28.583
- Really?
- Absolutely.

09:28.583 --> 09:32.291
What's the X
stand for?

09:32.291 --> 09:35.583
The X will stand for
pretty much anything.

09:35.583 --> 09:37.583
Francis X.

09:37.583 --> 09:39.291
Francis X.,
where you from?

09:39.291 --> 09:40.958
Where do you
think I'm from?

09:40.958 --> 09:43.791
Mmm...

09:43.791 --> 09:45.291
what's that state
between, uh,

09:45.291 --> 09:48.458
Ohio and California?

09:48.458 --> 09:50.708
The state
of oblivion.

09:50.708 --> 09:53.083
You fucking with me,
Francis X.?

09:53.083 --> 09:55.625
- No.
- I don't like to be
fucked with.

09:55.625 --> 09:56.708
I'm not fucking
with you.

09:56.708 --> 09:59.958
So what's the state
I'm talking about?

10:01.625 --> 10:04.416
- Missouri.
- That's where you're from.

10:04.416 --> 10:05.500
- Isn't it?
- You got me.

10:05.500 --> 10:07.791
I'm a good judge
of character.

10:07.791 --> 10:09.666
Just ask
my first two husbands.

10:11.500 --> 10:13.750
They didn't know
what they were missing.

10:13.750 --> 10:17.083
About 800 bucks
and some paste jewelry
by the time I was done.

10:17.083 --> 10:19.208
- Ah.
- Mm-hmm.

10:21.458 --> 10:23.041
What brings you
to our fair city,

10:23.041 --> 10:26.291
"Francis X. Bushman
from Missouri"?

10:27.666 --> 10:28.708
Judge my character.

10:32.750 --> 10:35.708
You come for some kind
of convention.

10:35.708 --> 10:38.958
You sell hosiery
or hair combs

10:38.958 --> 10:42.000
or hatbands
or who gives a fuck.

10:42.000 --> 10:43.583
You're married,
but your wife hasn't
sucked your cock

10:43.583 --> 10:45.833
since Harding
bought the farm.

10:45.833 --> 10:49.500
You used to run around
with your asshole pals,

10:49.500 --> 10:52.333
get yourself boiled
on Saturday night.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.166
Line up at the one
whorehouse in town,

10:54.166 --> 10:57.458
come quick,
and lie about it after.

10:57.458 --> 10:59.666
But now you're mostly
thinking about

10:59.666 --> 11:00.750
fucking your secretary,

11:00.750 --> 11:04.250
stealing a boatload
off your boss,

11:04.250 --> 11:05.750
and whether or not
it would hurt more

11:05.750 --> 11:08.250
to stand in front
of a trolley

11:08.250 --> 11:09.666
or shoot yourself
in the head.

11:12.583 --> 11:15.625
Oh... and you love
your children.

11:18.208 --> 11:20.458
How'd I do?

11:23.041 --> 11:24.666
I sell floor polish.

11:24.666 --> 11:27.750
Oh, you poor,
sad fuck.

11:27.750 --> 11:30.375
What the hell
are you doing here?

11:31.875 --> 11:34.541
Looking
for a good time.

11:34.541 --> 11:35.625
You know what kind
of place this is?

11:39.083 --> 11:41.750
This is
where hope comes

11:41.750 --> 11:44.083
to get fucked
in the ass.

11:46.125 --> 11:47.750
When's she showing up?

11:47.750 --> 11:49.916
( laughs )

11:49.916 --> 11:51.500
If we run now,

11:51.500 --> 11:53.708
how's D'Angelo
gonna know?

11:53.708 --> 11:55.791
Run where?
With what?

11:58.291 --> 12:00.708
Hey.

12:00.708 --> 12:03.750
Get into the count room,
drop off the money.

12:03.750 --> 12:04.833
Leave the satchel,
don't open it.

12:04.833 --> 12:08.041
I step out,
start a conversation...

12:08.041 --> 12:09.625
"Anybody catch
that Cubs game?"

12:09.625 --> 12:11.666
I double back with the key,
empty the satchel,

12:11.666 --> 12:13.083
open the safe.

12:16.625 --> 12:20.583
This has not been
thought through.

12:20.583 --> 12:21.625
( sighs )
Fuck.

12:25.833 --> 12:29.458
What I said before,
about your spouse,

12:29.458 --> 12:32.125
you know,
being an accident...

12:32.125 --> 12:34.750
I didn't
mean it in a sense
of something horrible.

12:37.708 --> 12:39.500
What's all
the whispering?

12:39.500 --> 12:40.958
- Drop-off.
- Come back in the morning.

12:40.958 --> 12:43.708
It's already a day late.
We want to get it in now.

12:43.708 --> 12:45.458
Give it to me.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.875
We need to be sure
it's added.

12:46.875 --> 12:48.250
Nothing personal.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.416
All right.
Come on, hurry up.

12:56.625 --> 12:58.750
( faint music playing )

12:59.875 --> 13:04.000
Wait, wait, wait.
I don't have the key.

13:05.208 --> 13:06.458
You know where
the key is?

13:06.458 --> 13:07.041
Big Boy's desk?

13:07.041 --> 13:08.333
Go get it.

13:08.333 --> 13:09.708
No one
touches the desk.

13:09.708 --> 13:12.916
- Unless he's here.
- He's not here now.

13:12.916 --> 13:14.166
We really need
to drop this off.

13:14.166 --> 13:17.416
Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What are you doing?

13:17.416 --> 13:20.458
- Trying the knob.
- Can't do that.

13:20.458 --> 13:22.125
If it's open,
it's open, right?

13:23.875 --> 13:25.166
( moaning )

13:25.166 --> 13:25.708
( gasps )

13:30.375 --> 13:31.375
We, uh...

13:31.375 --> 13:33.291
Ralph:
Don't you fucking move!

13:37.500 --> 13:39.458
What are you
creeping around for?

13:39.458 --> 13:40.958
- A drop-off.
- The room is closed.

13:40.958 --> 13:44.125
- It was unlocked, so...
- It was occupied!

13:44.125 --> 13:45.833
It was as occupied
as a room can get!

13:45.833 --> 13:48.333
- We were late.
- Just a little late.

13:48.333 --> 13:50.666
- Last time there
was some concern.
- Give that to me.

13:50.666 --> 13:53.458
Uh, technically
that's supposed to go
in the, uh...

13:56.916 --> 14:00.083
Well, as long as it's
in Ralph's hands,

14:00.083 --> 14:01.750
I guess it's okay to...

14:16.125 --> 14:17.583
What the fuck are you
trying to pull?

14:17.583 --> 14:20.791
What are we trying
to pull?

14:23.791 --> 14:26.541
Ralph, you want us
to track down the Big Boy?

14:40.000 --> 14:42.125
Go find Mike D'Angelo.

14:52.666 --> 14:54.541
Let me take her out of here.
Just let me do that.

14:54.541 --> 14:57.541
So you can
book off again?

14:57.541 --> 15:00.250
You didn't come for me.

15:00.250 --> 15:02.166
You the honeypot,
though, ain't you?

15:02.166 --> 15:05.416
You can't want
her part of this.
It's not what you are.

15:05.416 --> 15:07.208
You don't know me,
do you?

15:07.208 --> 15:08.625
I know
you wouldn't stop.

15:08.625 --> 15:11.041
I know I had to leave
or never be free.

15:12.291 --> 15:15.041
You free now?

15:17.791 --> 15:21.083
Seven years I close
my eyes at night.

15:22.875 --> 15:26.000
Only thing got me to sleep
was your voice in my head.

15:26.000 --> 15:30.541
Then I realized
I didn't even remember
what you sound like.

15:30.541 --> 15:33.041
Just made you up.

15:35.250 --> 15:39.791
Tell me what happened.

15:39.791 --> 15:41.541
Please?

15:43.500 --> 15:45.208
Where are we?

15:45.208 --> 15:46.500
Oh...

15:46.500 --> 15:49.500
we're in New York,
precious.

15:49.500 --> 15:51.666
Like I said we'd be.

15:51.666 --> 15:53.500
- Althea: I fell asleep.
- ( Thunder rumbles )

15:53.500 --> 15:55.125
Yes, you did.

15:55.125 --> 15:57.833
Can I have
something to eat?

15:57.833 --> 16:00.000
As soon
as we finish here.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.708
Althea:
How soon is that?

16:02.708 --> 16:03.583
Not long.

16:06.041 --> 16:07.541
Will it be?

16:12.125 --> 16:14.291
Where you hail from,
little one?

16:14.291 --> 16:16.916
It's okay.
You can tell him.

16:16.916 --> 16:20.375
I was born
in Oklahoma.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.333
But we've been
all over.

16:22.333 --> 16:24.041
When your mama sing?

16:24.041 --> 16:25.250
She doesn't sing.

16:25.250 --> 16:28.125
Then what she do?

16:28.125 --> 16:31.166
Work for Mr. Engler.

16:31.166 --> 16:32.916
Yeah? Who that?

16:32.916 --> 16:36.250
He's a white man
in Memphis.

16:38.958 --> 16:41.458
What she do for him?

16:42.541 --> 16:45.958
I keep his toilets clean.

16:45.958 --> 16:47.208
( thunder rumbling )

16:47.208 --> 16:50.125
I'm begging you.

16:50.125 --> 16:52.125
( doorknob rattling )

16:52.125 --> 16:54.000
Narcisse:
Will you let me in?

16:55.583 --> 16:57.583
We can't talk
if I'm not able to see you.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.791
It's a long way to travel
for foolish games.

17:01.791 --> 17:04.290
Let him in.

17:06.000 --> 17:08.165
Go on.

17:13.875 --> 17:15.500
Okay.

17:15.500 --> 17:18.540
Go sit over there
and be quiet.

17:18.540 --> 17:19.790
Go sit over there.

17:31.583 --> 17:34.708
( distant music playing )

17:40.416 --> 17:42.166
I see.

17:42.166 --> 17:44.833
( thunder rumbling,
streetcar bell ringing )

17:47.250 --> 17:50.250
( door closes )

18:07.666 --> 18:10.208
What's your name?

18:11.666 --> 18:14.125
My name's Althea.

18:14.125 --> 18:15.500
That's pretty.

18:15.500 --> 18:16.708
Do you know
what it means?

18:19.083 --> 18:22.833
It means "healing"
in ancient Greek.

18:23.541 --> 18:26.666
My name is Valentin.

18:34.541 --> 18:36.625
And this man,
do you know him?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.375
They ain't
a part of this.

18:49.000 --> 18:53.500
Well, I suppose we all
have our affairs to discuss.

18:55.125 --> 18:57.791
- ( music chiming )
- ( People chatting )

18:57.791 --> 18:59.958
( thunder rumbling )

19:10.958 --> 19:12.833
How are you keeping,
Mr. Glass?

19:12.833 --> 19:15.166
Look at the ocean.

19:15.166 --> 19:17.000
What about it?

19:17.000 --> 19:21.583
That color...
two weeks before
the season starts?

19:21.583 --> 19:23.500
Bad sign.

19:23.500 --> 19:25.416
Looks all right
to me.

19:25.416 --> 19:27.166
That's hurricane water.

19:27.166 --> 19:29.541
- Nucky:
Kind of early for that.
- Bad sign for the summer.

19:29.541 --> 19:32.958
Let's hope
for the best.

19:32.958 --> 19:35.458
That's easy
for you to say.

19:37.416 --> 19:40.833
I have three
and a half months
to make my living out here.

19:40.833 --> 19:42.041
If I don't turn a profit now,
I don't turn one.

19:42.041 --> 19:44.500
At all.

19:46.416 --> 19:49.333
But that never stops
the lot of you showing
up like clockwork.

19:50.791 --> 19:52.500
Does it?

19:52.500 --> 19:54.125
How's that?

19:54.125 --> 19:55.791
Where's Lindsay anyway?

19:55.791 --> 19:58.333
Sheriff's got his hands
full today, so...

20:01.250 --> 20:04.041
There's a problem.

20:04.041 --> 20:05.583
- Yes, sir?
- Little thief
running around.

20:05.583 --> 20:06.708
You need to get on it.

20:06.708 --> 20:08.666
- What?
- Sneaky little monkey.

20:08.666 --> 20:10.208
Comes in right behind
the customers.

20:10.208 --> 20:12.125
Before you know it,
makes off with a box
of Caporals.

20:12.125 --> 20:14.458
Twice now.

20:14.458 --> 20:15.875
Can you
describe him?

20:15.875 --> 20:19.000
( sighs )
10, 11.

20:19.000 --> 20:20.500
Flat cap.
Dirty little monkey.

20:20.500 --> 20:24.208
Well, we'll keep
an eye out.

20:26.208 --> 20:27.541
I'm giving you
this why?

20:27.541 --> 20:32.458
I vow to bring
that rascal to justice,
Mr. Glass.

20:34.583 --> 20:36.666
( chiming continues )

20:45.333 --> 20:47.750
( women laughing )

20:47.750 --> 20:50.250
"Take your war-club,
Puggawaugun,."

20:50.250 --> 20:51.666
And your mittens,
Minjekahwun,

20:51.666 --> 20:53.125
And your birch-canoe
for sailing"...

20:53.125 --> 20:56.583
- He's gonna blow it.
- You can see it in his eyes.

20:56.583 --> 20:59.625
"may pass
the black pitch-water;."

20:59.625 --> 21:01.541
Slay this merciless
magician,

21:01.541 --> 21:05.625
Save the people
from the fever.

21:05.625 --> 21:09.083
That he breathes across
the fen-lands, And"...

21:11.000 --> 21:13.416
Oh, Francis.
Give up.

21:13.416 --> 21:14.500
I had to memorize
the whole thing.

21:14.500 --> 21:17.375
You lowly
piece of crap.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.250
You worm.

21:19.250 --> 21:21.375
- You dog. You hound.
- You kangaroo.

21:21.375 --> 21:24.291
- ( laughing )
- What?

21:24.291 --> 21:26.833
You know, hop, hop.

21:26.833 --> 21:29.000
I am a kangaroo.
How do you do?

21:29.000 --> 21:30.416
In my pouch
I have a kazoo.

21:30.416 --> 21:32.333
What the fuck are you
talking about?

21:32.333 --> 21:34.875
- Take your shirt off.
- Huh?

21:34.875 --> 21:38.708
You lost the bet.
You got to take
something off.

21:38.708 --> 21:41.833
- Woman ♪2: Let's go.
- How come you never lose?

21:41.833 --> 21:43.625
We're smarter than you.

21:43.625 --> 21:46.166
And younger.

21:47.583 --> 21:49.375
( gulps )
Oh, this is shit.

21:49.375 --> 21:50.958
Worst booze in town.

21:50.958 --> 21:52.208
Worst booze
in New Jersey.

21:52.208 --> 21:53.500
Fuck you, Irene.

21:53.500 --> 21:55.791
What'd you have
to say that for?

21:55.791 --> 21:57.250
'Cause
I felt like it.

21:57.250 --> 22:00.875
You're a lousy,
goddamn lush.

22:00.875 --> 22:02.125
And you're
King Neptune's consort.

22:02.125 --> 22:04.916
I almost was once.

22:04.916 --> 22:07.416
King Neptune's
cocksucker.

22:07.416 --> 22:09.500
Try it again,
I'll brain you.

22:11.791 --> 22:13.958
I know where to get
the good stuff.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.291
Yeah? Where?

22:16.291 --> 22:19.875
The Ritz-Carlton.
I'll walk you right in.

22:19.875 --> 22:21.583
And how you
gonna do that?

22:21.583 --> 22:24.125
Mama dressed me
for the parade.

22:24.125 --> 22:25.750
They know
who I am there.

22:25.750 --> 22:30.083
Well, then, Francis,
what the fuck are you
doing with us?

22:30.083 --> 22:34.041
I know them,
but I'm not like them.

22:34.041 --> 22:35.791
I'm like you.

22:35.791 --> 22:38.458
- Irene: I had little wings.
- Start at the bottom.

22:38.458 --> 22:41.666
With nothing.
You have nothing.

22:41.666 --> 22:42.916
Irene:
A little tiara.

22:42.916 --> 22:45.291
There's an opportunity.
You take it.

22:45.291 --> 22:47.000
What choice do you have?

22:47.000 --> 22:49.291
I looked like
an angel.

22:49.291 --> 22:52.541
You don't have a choice.
Get yourself ahead.

22:52.541 --> 22:54.291
What else can you do?

22:54.291 --> 22:55.750
For what, though, huh?

22:55.750 --> 22:56.708
For what?

22:56.708 --> 22:58.916
No one ever talks
about that.

22:58.916 --> 23:00.958
No one ever asks.
What's the point...

23:00.958 --> 23:04.583
Man:
Why don't you
shut the fuck up?

23:07.583 --> 23:09.041
Excuse me?

23:09.041 --> 23:12.625
Nobody wants to listen
to your stupid shit.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.791
I'm not talking to you.

23:14.791 --> 23:17.541
I can hear you anyways.
I'm fucking sick of it.

23:17.541 --> 23:19.125
Then go somewhere else.

23:19.125 --> 23:22.416
This is my place.
This is where I belong.

23:22.416 --> 23:25.541
- Sure is.
- ( Laughs )

23:25.541 --> 23:28.541
What's that, you old whore?
I'll punch your tits off.

23:28.541 --> 23:32.000
You, too,
you squirrel-faced cunt.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.125
Nucky:
Why don't you
watch your mouth?

23:34.125 --> 23:37.083
Why don't you spoon
the shit out of my asshole
and eat it for dinner?

23:37.083 --> 23:39.416
( women laughing )

23:39.416 --> 23:43.125
I think you need
to apologize to these ladies.

23:44.958 --> 23:47.125
Make me.

23:47.125 --> 23:50.291
Oh, Francis.
Help us, please.

23:54.958 --> 23:57.083
"Straightway
from the Shining Wigwam."

23:57.083 --> 23:59.083
Came the mighty
Megissogwon,

23:59.083 --> 24:01.458
Tall of stature,
broad of shoulder,

24:01.458 --> 24:04.541
Clad from head
to foot in wampum,

24:04.541 --> 24:06.583
"armed with all
his warlike weapons."

24:27.000 --> 24:29.250
Apologize.

24:32.041 --> 24:33.666
Apologize.

24:33.666 --> 24:36.000
Suck my dick,
Mary Jane.

24:51.375 --> 24:53.125
"Thus departed Hiawatha,."

24:53.125 --> 24:56.083
To the regions
of the home-wind,

24:56.083 --> 24:58.500
To the Islands
of the Blessed,

24:58.500 --> 25:00.333
To the Kingdom
of Ponemah,

25:00.333 --> 25:02.666
"To the Land
of the Hereafter."

25:04.958 --> 25:07.583
See?
I do know it.

25:07.583 --> 25:09.666
Guess you win
after all.

25:12.041 --> 25:13.750
What do I get?

25:15.125 --> 25:16.458
What do you want?

25:16.458 --> 25:20.000
Man: Come on.
Wake up, Walter.

25:20.000 --> 25:23.125
I want
to fuck you both.

25:57.250 --> 25:59.291
( grunts )

26:02.208 --> 26:03.000
Who wants
to talk first?

26:03.000 --> 26:05.666
Maybe you.

26:09.333 --> 26:11.083
We...

26:12.500 --> 26:15.000
uh...

26:15.000 --> 26:18.166
came to rob
the joint?

26:18.166 --> 26:20.833
The fucking balls.

26:20.833 --> 26:24.250
We knew the Big Boy
would be out and...

26:24.250 --> 26:28.000
- Skeleton crew.
- Yeah, skeleton crew.

26:28.000 --> 26:29.958
Figured it'd be easy.

26:29.958 --> 26:33.000
How did you geniuses
get that idea?

26:33.000 --> 26:34.875
My wife.

26:34.875 --> 26:37.833
Your wife told you
to rob Al Capone?

26:37.833 --> 26:39.750
We're having
trouble at home.

26:42.958 --> 26:44.958
I can vouch for that.

26:53.625 --> 26:55.166
How you want
to handle this?

26:55.166 --> 26:56.666
Only one
choice, right?

26:58.416 --> 27:01.458
You're the boss.
You want to do it?

27:02.583 --> 27:04.416
Do you want me
to do it?

27:08.291 --> 27:10.000
Do you want
to wait for Al?

27:12.708 --> 27:13.583
( sighs )

27:13.583 --> 27:15.875
Just get 'em
out of here.

27:15.875 --> 27:18.916
- Neat and quick.
- That's me all over.

27:18.916 --> 27:20.458
You need
any of these guys?

27:20.458 --> 27:22.500
Nah, I got
my boys outside.

27:27.625 --> 27:29.750
- Let's go.
- Where to?

27:30.375 --> 27:33.625
Dance marathon.

27:33.625 --> 27:35.708
Let's see how long
you can stay on your feet.

27:37.375 --> 27:39.666
Do you want
another one?

27:39.666 --> 27:41.625
No, sir.

27:43.083 --> 27:44.250
- Off to the races.
- ( Doors open )

27:44.250 --> 27:45.666
( laughing )

27:49.666 --> 27:51.666
Evening, Al.
You're back early.

27:51.666 --> 27:53.208
Yeah.

27:59.583 --> 28:02.875
♪ Any little duck

28:02.875 --> 28:05.541

28:11.916 --> 28:12.916
( laughing )

28:12.916 --> 28:15.416
Ralphie, meet
my new friends.

28:15.416 --> 28:17.041
Mr. Paul Muni,
Mr. George Raft.

28:17.041 --> 28:19.000
They've journeyed here
from Hollywood, California.

28:19.000 --> 28:21.625
Land of dreams.
Tell him why you're
here, George.

28:21.625 --> 28:24.166
We're doing
a crime picture.

28:24.166 --> 28:25.791
- Set in Chicago.
- That's right.

28:25.791 --> 28:27.083
About?

28:27.083 --> 28:28.875
Kind of
a Shakespearean drama.

28:28.875 --> 28:31.500
- Man's rise and fall.
- With lots of action.

28:31.500 --> 28:32.708
And he gets it
in the end, right?

28:32.708 --> 28:34.125
That's how
they have to do it.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.041
And to show them
how that works,

28:36.041 --> 28:39.041
I figured I'd introduce
them to Mr. Bugs Moran.

28:39.041 --> 28:40.416
( laughing )

28:40.416 --> 28:43.208
Break open
the Cubanos.

28:43.208 --> 28:45.541
Drinks.
Let's get a card
game going, huh?

28:47.541 --> 28:50.125
What are you
doing here?

28:52.666 --> 28:53.875
We were just leaving.

28:53.875 --> 28:55.291
That's a different
question.

28:56.791 --> 28:58.500
Taking care
of a problem, Al.

28:59.708 --> 29:01.333
What problem?

29:04.666 --> 29:07.291
( whispering )

29:11.666 --> 29:13.541
Interesting.

29:15.375 --> 29:16.708
You two make
yourselves at home.

29:16.708 --> 29:18.000
( laughs )

29:18.000 --> 29:20.750
You two, over here.

29:21.875 --> 29:23.666
If you would be
so kind.

29:24.333 --> 29:27.208
You heard the man.

29:27.208 --> 29:30.041
Okay, folks, listen up.
Look up, walk up, and pay up.

29:30.041 --> 29:32.750
Yes, it's a grand day
to stroll the boardwalk.

29:32.750 --> 29:36.000
But we got more to see
than water and sand.

29:36.000 --> 29:38.416
Just one nickel
pays admission

29:38.416 --> 29:39.875
to Atlantic City's
very own...

29:39.875 --> 29:42.333
- Could you put a word in?
- It's tricky.

29:42.333 --> 29:45.291
I'm not looking for much.
Just something in
the department.

29:45.291 --> 29:46.958
It needs to be
the right time.

29:46.958 --> 29:47.875
Jim Neary gets
put up for alderman.

29:47.875 --> 29:49.208
You want to be
like Jim Neary?

29:49.208 --> 29:51.791
Man doesn't have
an honest bone
in his body.

29:51.791 --> 29:52.708
You paid money
to go to that dinner.

29:52.708 --> 29:54.500
What's that
got to do with it?

29:54.500 --> 29:57.583
Next time you see
the Commodore...

29:57.583 --> 29:59.500
I'll handle it.

29:59.500 --> 30:01.000
Well, maybe one
of the firehouses...

30:01.000 --> 30:03.541
Eli, you need
to trust me, okay?

30:11.375 --> 30:13.291
Nuck.

30:13.291 --> 30:15.750
- Hey, Nuck.
- What?

30:15.750 --> 30:17.958
Last Sunday,

30:17.958 --> 30:20.583
I went with June
and her parents
up to Brigantine.

30:20.583 --> 30:23.916
We're all walking
along the shore

30:23.916 --> 30:27.666
and she goes,
"I lost my hair ribbon.

30:27.666 --> 30:30.541
Help me find it."

30:30.541 --> 30:33.458
- We wind up behind the grass.
- Girl: Caporals! Caporals!

30:33.458 --> 30:36.166
- And she lets me
put my hand right there.
- A penny apiece. Caporals.

30:36.166 --> 30:40.166
- Hey, mister, cigarette?
- Eli: I couldn't believe it.

30:40.166 --> 30:42.375
You could hear them
all talking on the other...

30:42.375 --> 30:44.833
What's going on?

30:44.833 --> 30:46.000
Hey!

30:48.958 --> 30:51.250
Hey!

30:51.250 --> 30:53.250
- Man: Watch out!
- ( Woman gasps )

30:56.125 --> 30:58.083
Nucky:
Stop!

30:58.083 --> 30:59.541
Man:
Watch it!

31:03.541 --> 31:07.750
- ( panting )
- Barker: Popcorn, peanuts,
and a prize for the kiddies!

31:07.750 --> 31:11.750
One little nickel gets you
a lot of deliciousness!

31:11.750 --> 31:13.333
Right here,
get your pretzels...

31:13.333 --> 31:17.791
( barker continues )

31:28.500 --> 31:32.166
( seagulls squawking )

31:44.125 --> 31:45.458
This really hurts
my feelings.

31:45.458 --> 31:48.500
( faint music playing )

31:48.500 --> 31:51.416
I mean, what'd I
ever do to you, huh?

31:51.416 --> 31:54.708
Except give you
a leg up?

31:55.750 --> 31:59.666
I take you in.
Favor to your brother

31:59.666 --> 32:01.541
so you could lay low.

32:01.541 --> 32:02.125
Didn't I do that?

32:02.125 --> 32:04.958
You did.

32:04.958 --> 32:08.458
You ever say thank you?
I never heard it.

32:08.458 --> 32:11.291
Thank you
very much.

32:11.291 --> 32:12.541
Doesn't count now.

32:14.000 --> 32:17.833
And you.

32:17.833 --> 32:20.583
I thought
we was buddies.

32:20.583 --> 32:23.500
Of course we are, Al.

32:26.958 --> 32:28.708
You steal from buddies?

32:28.708 --> 32:31.750
What kind of a man
does that make you?

32:34.791 --> 32:36.208
Greedy.

32:36.208 --> 32:37.958
Just very greedy.

32:39.333 --> 32:40.750
And you?

32:42.291 --> 32:44.625
I'm greedy, too.

32:46.666 --> 32:48.333
Here's what
I'm thinking.

32:48.333 --> 32:51.958
I don't believe you.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.666
I think you're up
to something.

32:53.666 --> 32:57.333
I think Charlie
Luciano was right.

32:57.333 --> 33:00.083
I think you're
a fucking badge.

33:00.083 --> 33:04.375
Al, you got
your guests.

33:04.375 --> 33:06.958
Turn up the radio,
Ralphie.

33:10.625 --> 33:13.041
( music playing loudly )

33:16.875 --> 33:20.166
What you have to say?

33:31.625 --> 33:36.541
I am Nelson
Kasper Van Alden!

33:36.541 --> 33:40.333
I am a sworn agent
of the United States
Treasury.

33:40.333 --> 33:42.083
And I swear
by Jesus our Lord

33:42.083 --> 33:46.625
justice will rain down
upon you if it is my last...

33:46.625 --> 33:48.583
( gunshot )

33:50.666 --> 33:52.333
Fucking Fed
piece of shit.

33:52.333 --> 33:54.916
Get him off me!

33:54.916 --> 33:56.541
Get him off me!

33:58.458 --> 33:59.416
( gasps )

33:59.416 --> 34:02.500
You all right, Snork?

34:02.500 --> 34:04.750
He was gonna kill me.
He was gonna kill me.

34:04.750 --> 34:07.000
- Ralph: He was.
- Radio announcer: This
concludes our broadcast day.

34:07.000 --> 34:11.458
This is Herbert Carter
signing off from Chicago.

34:13.333 --> 34:16.250
All this time.
Fuck.

34:16.250 --> 34:17.875
The shit with the irons?

34:19.250 --> 34:21.875
Huh?

34:21.875 --> 34:24.250
Fuck!
Fuck you!

34:24.250 --> 34:26.208
- Fuck!
- I'm sorry, June.

34:26.208 --> 34:28.250
- Fucking son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

34:28.250 --> 34:30.500
- Man: Boss, you all right?
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry, June.

34:30.500 --> 34:32.583
- Ralph: It's all right.
- What are you mumbling?

34:32.583 --> 34:34.916
- Ralph: Stay out.
- Hey!

34:34.916 --> 34:36.875
I'm talking
to you, huh?!

34:36.875 --> 34:38.666
Spill it! Spill it now!

34:42.416 --> 34:45.083
( stammers )
W-We came for the ledgers.

34:45.083 --> 34:47.541
Why?

34:47.541 --> 34:49.625
We were told to.

34:51.208 --> 34:53.375
- By who?
- This Fed...

34:53.375 --> 34:56.708
who was squeezing us.

34:56.708 --> 34:58.916
What's his name, huh?

35:00.250 --> 35:02.833
Look, either way
it's over, huh?

35:02.833 --> 35:05.708
Tell me
and I'll make it quick.

35:06.916 --> 35:08.500
Eli:
This "Prohee"...

35:11.041 --> 35:12.791
named Ness.

35:27.333 --> 35:29.083
We was barbers, Ralphie?

35:29.083 --> 35:32.083
Yeah?

35:34.000 --> 35:36.333
We would be asleep now.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.458
( chuckles )

35:39.375 --> 35:41.500
Face down
in a cornfield.

35:43.291 --> 35:44.916
D'Angelo:
Sure thing, Al.

35:47.625 --> 35:49.458
What do we tell
his brother?

35:49.458 --> 35:52.875
Luciano's taking
care of him.

36:09.708 --> 36:10.708
Ralph:
Mike?

36:12.541 --> 36:14.458
Watch him.

36:18.666 --> 36:20.833
You finish that,

36:20.833 --> 36:23.000
Al wants you to run
this over to Cicero.

36:25.125 --> 36:27.541
He's not feeling safe.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.625
He's very grateful
for what you've done.

36:59.791 --> 37:02.208
- Lobby.
- ( Elevator bell rings )

37:14.500 --> 37:16.666
He had two kids.

37:16.666 --> 37:18.750
So do I.

37:18.750 --> 37:21.333
When they ask
what I do, I won't be
ashamed to tell them.

37:25.291 --> 37:26.875
What happens to me?

37:26.875 --> 37:29.125
You think
I give a shit?

37:39.416 --> 37:41.083
Buy yourself
a bus ticket.

37:54.541 --> 37:56.458
Dinah:
Hiawatha?

38:14.291 --> 38:16.416
You like
the decor?

38:16.416 --> 38:18.916
Just what I was
looking for.

38:18.916 --> 38:21.125
Then what's
your pleasure?

38:22.375 --> 38:23.541
Her first,
then you.

38:25.916 --> 38:28.458
You don't like me?

38:28.458 --> 38:30.416
Save you for last.

38:30.416 --> 38:34.166
Where do you
want to do it?

38:34.166 --> 38:37.083
- Right here.
- ( Laughs )

38:37.083 --> 38:39.125
Filthy little boy.

38:39.125 --> 38:42.041
Son of a Piney,
that's me.

38:42.041 --> 38:44.125
I thought you
was from Missouri.

38:45.541 --> 38:48.083
I am a kangaroo.
How do you do?

38:48.083 --> 38:50.208
( both laugh )

38:55.250 --> 38:58.333
Let's get dirty.

39:06.500 --> 39:08.500
Looking for my pouch?

39:08.500 --> 39:10.500
- ( gasps )
- Found it.

39:10.500 --> 39:12.041
Hop on in.

39:12.041 --> 39:13.791
Francis,
just so you know,

39:13.791 --> 39:16.583
nothing personal.

39:20.541 --> 39:22.833
- Boss still inside?
- Mm-hmm.

39:26.333 --> 39:28.916
Well, is this
how you imagined it?

39:28.916 --> 39:32.708
These many years?
With another innocent
at hand? It can't be.

39:32.708 --> 39:34.583
You think you
getting out of this?

39:34.583 --> 39:36.125
The battle
is already over.

39:36.125 --> 39:38.458
I walked in here
on my own accord.
I have no weapon.

39:38.458 --> 39:41.333
- Your men outside.
- That would all
happen after.

39:41.333 --> 39:44.458
Does that matter to you?
I don't think it does.

39:45.875 --> 39:47.708
Chalky:
Send the little one out.

39:47.708 --> 39:49.750
But not Miss Maitland?

39:51.666 --> 39:54.000
( distant streetcar bells
ringing )

39:55.416 --> 39:56.166
What you come here for?

39:56.166 --> 39:59.791
True, now.

40:22.875 --> 40:24.583
I need to open it.

40:26.333 --> 40:28.291
( suitcase latches
click )

40:37.291 --> 40:39.500
I paid for the studio,

40:39.500 --> 40:41.416
the musicians,
the pressing.

40:41.416 --> 40:44.708
No one will play it.

40:44.708 --> 40:46.625
No one will hire me.

40:46.625 --> 40:48.041
Not in Chicago.
Not in Kansas City.

40:48.041 --> 40:50.500
- Not anywhere.
- What have I to do
with that?

40:50.500 --> 40:53.000
You stopped them
to stop me.

40:53.000 --> 40:57.375
My reach extends to every
honky-tonk and barrelhouse?

40:57.375 --> 40:59.916
I can't live that way.
Not with her.

40:59.916 --> 41:01.666
Give her up.
Others do.

41:01.666 --> 41:04.125
You are drowning me.

41:04.125 --> 41:06.541
Drop by drop.

41:06.541 --> 41:07.625
Perhaps the failing
is your own.

41:17.791 --> 41:20.208
Won't you let me go?

41:26.083 --> 41:28.875
I came here from
a meeting downtown...

41:28.875 --> 41:31.000
more truthful to say
I was summoned...

41:31.000 --> 41:32.750
with a Mr. Luciano.

41:35.208 --> 41:37.041
I remember him.

41:37.041 --> 41:39.875
I am being
dictated terms.

41:41.500 --> 41:44.833
I will be allowed
to conduct my business,

41:44.833 --> 41:48.833
but only under
his control.

41:48.833 --> 41:52.333
In exchange,
I will be protected
from others of his kind.

41:52.333 --> 41:54.875
He will allow me

41:54.875 --> 41:58.291
to conduct my business
in my home.

41:59.291 --> 42:01.625
This is the new
order of things.

42:01.625 --> 42:04.041
- Ain't no concern of mine.
- What if it were?

42:04.041 --> 42:06.625
And am I worse
than those devils
who betrayed you?

42:06.625 --> 42:08.250
You the only devil
I know.

42:08.250 --> 42:10.583
Call me what you will.
I never claimed to be
your friend.

42:10.583 --> 42:13.958
I'll make a place
for you.

42:13.958 --> 42:16.250
I'll pay you well.

42:16.250 --> 42:17.375
If it's blood you want,

42:17.375 --> 42:18.375
you'll have your chance
to spill it.

42:18.375 --> 42:22.250
( scoffs )
Me help you?

42:22.250 --> 42:24.166
Narcisse:
You help yourself.

42:24.166 --> 42:27.208
Every soul in this room
yearns to be free.

42:35.375 --> 42:37.458
Put the record on.

42:37.458 --> 42:40.541
I'm making you an offer.
You'll not get a better one.

42:40.541 --> 42:42.500
Put it on.

42:57.416 --> 43:00.583

43:19.708 --> 43:24.750

44:04.208 --> 44:05.250
No.

44:05.250 --> 44:08.083
Chalky:
Don't really matter to me.

44:08.958 --> 44:11.583
It's not
what I came for.

44:11.583 --> 44:13.583
You came to be heard.
That's your voice.

44:15.375 --> 44:18.416
You set it up
and I belong to you.

44:19.625 --> 44:21.833
Pick the city.
I'll make the call.

44:21.833 --> 44:22.666
You'll be booked
tomorrow.

44:35.041 --> 44:38.708
You weren't put
on this earth to be
no ofay's maid.

44:40.541 --> 44:43.958
( softly )
You can't trust him.

44:43.958 --> 44:46.458
Don't you know that?

44:46.458 --> 44:50.166
I say I can.
Far as I need to.

45:07.291 --> 45:09.125
( chuckles )

45:11.958 --> 45:13.791
You ever meet
your daddy?

45:13.791 --> 45:18.375
Mama loved him,
but she had to leave.

45:28.875 --> 45:30.791
Baby girl...

45:32.500 --> 45:34.708
you stay real close
to your mama now, you hear?

45:34.708 --> 45:38.375
Keep her away
from men like me.

45:42.416 --> 45:45.208
Let's get to business.

45:47.833 --> 45:50.708
I'll need the gun.
As a gesture of loyalty.

46:13.541 --> 46:15.083
They leave first.

46:15.083 --> 46:17.083
We'll all go together.

46:17.083 --> 46:19.750
What sense
that make?

46:22.000 --> 46:23.625
We headed in
different places.

46:26.000 --> 46:28.916
Go on, now.

46:37.500 --> 46:39.458
Help with that,
ma'am?

47:07.416 --> 47:08.625
Yes, of course
you do.

47:36.125 --> 47:39.041
Our collaboration
begins.

47:46.333 --> 47:48.708
Pop wants
to see you.

47:48.708 --> 47:50.875
Why, does he
need money?

47:50.875 --> 47:53.500
- It's not like that.
- Then what?

47:53.500 --> 47:56.541
He's only got
two sons.

47:56.541 --> 47:59.458
I see Ma,
that's what matters.

47:59.458 --> 48:02.958
Talks about you
all the time.

48:04.000 --> 48:05.750
Fuck him.

48:05.750 --> 48:08.041
Don't use words
like that.

48:12.416 --> 48:14.500
Mabel's pregnant.

48:15.500 --> 48:17.458
She is?

48:17.458 --> 48:20.333
Well, that's bully.

48:25.125 --> 48:29.333
( distant music chiming,
barker speaking )

48:34.375 --> 48:36.833
- Hold on there.
- ( Gasps )

48:36.833 --> 48:40.000
- ( grunting )
- All right. All right.

48:40.000 --> 48:41.583
Calm down.
No one's gonna hurt you.

48:41.583 --> 48:44.708
You're caught,
that's all.

48:57.500 --> 48:58.875
Been busy today, hmm?

49:03.250 --> 49:05.916
What's your name?

49:08.750 --> 49:10.750
You must have a name.

49:12.000 --> 49:13.666
Nellie Bly.

49:13.666 --> 49:14.750
Don't cut shines
with me.

49:14.750 --> 49:18.041
That's what it says
on the book.

49:31.416 --> 49:33.750
I'm Nucky.

49:33.750 --> 49:36.333
That's my brother Eli.

49:38.333 --> 49:41.041
It's not as bad as you think.
Just tell me your name.

49:42.625 --> 49:45.333
Gillian.

49:45.333 --> 49:47.208
That's not a name
for a boy.

49:47.208 --> 49:48.541
I'm not a boy.

49:56.125 --> 49:58.500
( bottles rattling )

50:02.291 --> 50:04.916
Fuck you looking at?

50:04.916 --> 50:09.333
You think I don't
know who you are?

50:09.333 --> 50:11.166
You little
thieving monkey.

50:11.166 --> 50:12.916
I'll run you
out of town.

50:12.916 --> 50:15.291
What?

50:15.291 --> 50:17.375
You expect
some kind of favor?

50:17.375 --> 50:20.250
You stupid
fucking child.

50:20.250 --> 50:22.291
Why would you trust me?

50:25.125 --> 50:26.708
I don't understand.

50:34.833 --> 50:36.833
( groans )

50:39.000 --> 50:40.750
Old Rumpus.
$50.

50:45.250 --> 50:48.500
You hear me?
I'll give you 50.

50:49.750 --> 50:51.166
I said I'll pay you.

50:51.166 --> 50:53.833
You don't have to pay me, sir.
I already work for you.

51:04.958 --> 51:07.125
( seagulls squawking )

51:15.333 --> 51:17.666
To see you.

51:26.375 --> 51:29.458
( distant waves
crashing )

51:37.583 --> 51:39.500
What's your name?

51:39.500 --> 51:41.958
Joe Harper.

51:41.958 --> 51:43.791
Where from?

51:43.791 --> 51:45.541
Indiana.

51:45.541 --> 51:48.416
What are you
doing here?

51:48.416 --> 51:49.750
Trying to get ahead.

51:52.833 --> 51:55.416
What you saw tonight...

51:55.416 --> 51:57.583
- I didn't see anything.
- You saw me.

52:00.208 --> 52:01.875
Anything I might
have said...

52:01.875 --> 52:04.208
You just said
you wanted to go home.

52:09.833 --> 52:11.666
Take it.

52:11.666 --> 52:13.416
No, sir.

52:13.416 --> 52:14.541
Why not?

52:14.541 --> 52:17.166
You just had
a rough night.

52:17.166 --> 52:20.208
That's all.

52:20.208 --> 52:22.500
Besides, if you
only help people
to help yourself,

52:22.500 --> 52:27.291
what kind of world
would it be?

52:27.291 --> 52:30.583
Someone I was close to
just died

52:30.583 --> 52:33.041
because of me.

52:33.041 --> 52:35.416
Last thing I heard
her say was,

52:35.416 --> 52:37.541
"Have your coffee."

52:40.166 --> 52:42.333
She's gone

52:42.333 --> 52:43.666
and I'm still here.

52:45.541 --> 52:48.541
What kind
of world is that?

52:52.333 --> 52:56.166
Come on, now.
It's not helping yourself.

52:56.166 --> 52:59.291
It's helping me.

53:09.916 --> 53:11.458
Señor?

53:11.458 --> 53:15.583
They are
downstairs.

53:17.000 --> 53:20.125
What?

53:20.125 --> 53:22.250
Mickey:
I need everybody
to listen good.

53:22.250 --> 53:24.666
You will swear an oath
of allegiance

53:24.666 --> 53:26.583
to Mr. Nucky Thompson
of Atlantic City, New Jersey,

53:26.583 --> 53:31.166
to protect and defend
his person and property
against all enemies,

53:31.166 --> 53:34.333
foreign and domestic, as long
as you both shall live.

53:38.625 --> 53:41.083
Nobody knew
where you were.

53:41.083 --> 53:42.541
So I done a Paul Revere.

53:45.416 --> 53:47.541
We saddling up
for a showdown or not?

53:55.416 --> 53:56.708
We are.

54:16.166 --> 54:17.750
Bring the car around.

54:21.791 --> 54:24.541
You ain't never gonna
stop them white boys.

54:26.583 --> 54:27.583
Why do you say that?

54:27.583 --> 54:31.375
They everywhere.
You just here.

54:33.000 --> 54:34.750
I'd call surviving
a victory.

54:38.000 --> 54:39.833
Well, you pretty
slick at that.

54:41.541 --> 54:43.916
Gonna keep
your word to her?

54:44.833 --> 54:46.333
'Cause I'm keeping
to mine.

54:46.333 --> 54:50.333
How will you know?

54:51.791 --> 54:52.916
I won't.

54:54.875 --> 54:57.541
Then tell yourself
I will.

55:01.166 --> 55:03.708
All a dream
to begin with.

55:03.708 --> 55:07.500
Ain't nobody
ever been free.

55:34.291 --> 55:36.583
All right, then.

55:42.208 --> 55:47.041

bright above you ♪

55:47.041 --> 55:51.250
