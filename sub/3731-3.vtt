[eclectic orchestral theme plays]

02:23.262 --> 02:24.512
[whispers] Don't look at him.

02:26.056 --> 02:27.390
That's how he got me.

02:33.813 --> 02:37.109
[electric saw whirring]

02:50.580 --> 02:52.457
[gasps]

02:55.294 --> 02:57.212
Good, you're awake.

02:57.296 --> 02:59.589
- What happened? Where am I?
- You were in an accident.

02:59.672 --> 03:03.760
Lucky to be alive. The other officers
who brought you in last night

03:03.843 --> 03:07.889
said we should give you special attention,
said you're a hero.

03:07.973 --> 03:09.141
Bagged some terrorist.

03:10.725 --> 03:13.103
[sighs] Jonas.

03:14.020 --> 03:15.021
I gotta go.

03:15.105 --> 03:17.107
You're not going anywhere.

03:17.190 --> 03:18.775
We think you have a concussion,

03:18.858 --> 03:21.486
and the MRI is showing
some unusual brain activity.

03:21.569 --> 03:22.946
[laughing scoff]

03:23.029 --> 03:24.489
I'll bet.

03:24.572 --> 03:26.283
Hey-- Wait!

03:28.201 --> 03:30.120
Hey! I need a doctor!

03:32.580 --> 03:35.208
- Doctor...
- This is my fault.

03:38.253 --> 03:40.880
- [mouths TV dialogue]
- [woman] You mustn't blame yourself.

03:40.964 --> 03:42.966
It was me.

03:44.343 --> 03:48.847
You had the perfect life
and I destroyed it. Yes.

03:48.930 --> 03:50.765
- Why do you torture me?
- Oh, come on,

03:50.849 --> 03:52.267
you make me run the lines with you,

03:52.351 --> 03:55.270
and I don't get to watch Ms. Thing
ruin my scene?

03:55.354 --> 03:58.106
- [woman] You're completely innocent.
- [laughs]

03:58.190 --> 03:59.607
It is true.

04:00.984 --> 04:04.196
- Passion is never innocent.
- [giggling]

04:05.364 --> 04:06.739
Mm...

04:08.074 --> 04:10.743
[both laughing]

04:10.827 --> 04:12.453
Aw!

04:12.537 --> 04:14.455
You guys make such an adorable couple.

04:15.290 --> 04:17.292
[clearing throat]

04:17.376 --> 04:19.460
- Morning.
- [Daniela] Morning.

04:19.544 --> 04:20.628
You want an espresso?

04:21.504 --> 04:23.340
Ah! Yes, please.

04:26.176 --> 04:28.345
- [Daniela sighs]
- Go talk to her. Go talk to her.

04:28.428 --> 04:30.347
[whispers] Go.

04:30.430 --> 04:31.764
You have to talk to her.

[classical piano continues]

[up-tempo music playing]

06:15.243 --> 06:17.954
When I was young,
I wanted to be a zebra.

06:18.663 --> 06:20.457
Not a bad profession.

06:20.540 --> 06:25.295
I liked the idea of not having
to look for food or shelter,

06:25.378 --> 06:27.172
or have responsibility.

06:32.051 --> 06:34.971
[zebras calling nearby]

06:39.976 --> 06:42.020
I wish I was a zebra.

06:43.771 --> 06:46.191
- Is that so?
- Yes.

06:46.274 --> 06:51.737
If I was a zebra,
I would always have friends like them.

06:51.821 --> 06:52.905
[mother chuckles]

06:53.698 --> 06:56.368
You would make a very beautiful zebra.

06:56.451 --> 06:58.953
You know the best thing
about being a zebra?

06:59.037 --> 07:00.539
Tell me.

07:00.621 --> 07:07.587
If we were hungry, we'd just eat grass
and we wouldn't be hungry anymore.

07:08.505 --> 07:10.631
[sighs] Don't worry.

07:10.715 --> 07:14.844
As long as we're together,
something good is going to happen.

07:17.305 --> 07:21.934
Soon we'll be stuffing our bellies
fuller than any zebra.

07:24.103 --> 07:28.358
Though you must never have seen a zebra
after a lion has had its way with it.

07:28.441 --> 07:30.443
[chuckles] A lot more worse than this.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.278
[laughing]

07:32.362 --> 07:35.740
- Lion is definitely a downside.
- Mm.

07:35.823 --> 07:38.701
I'll tell you something
my father told me.

07:38.784 --> 07:41.704
As long as you're determined,
and you work hard,

07:41.787 --> 07:43.998
you can be anything you want to be.

07:44.082 --> 07:47.793
And if there's one person
who can be a zebra in this world,

07:47.877 --> 07:49.379
it's you, my friend.

07:50.922 --> 07:52.632
It is good advice.

07:54.092 --> 07:57.387
What did you tell your father
you wanted to be to receive such advice?

07:57.470 --> 07:59.514
Son of a rich man.

07:59.598 --> 08:02.934
[laughing]

08:04.561 --> 08:07.105
- Daniela?
- Oh.

08:07.188 --> 08:10.108
- I--
- This place is incredible.

08:10.191 --> 08:14.362
I mean, it's a clichÃ©, but you gay guys
really know how to decorate, huh?

08:14.446 --> 08:19.284
[stammers] I... I wanted
to talk to you about last night.

08:19.367 --> 08:21.620
Oh, my God, so much fun.

08:21.702 --> 08:27.166
I think we might have had...
a bit of a misunderstanding with--

08:27.250 --> 08:28.876
Did-- Did I overstep?

08:28.960 --> 08:33.714
Oh, I'm so sorry if I got carried away.
It's just that... I love gay porn.

08:34.715 --> 08:37.009
[coughs, clears throat]

08:38.177 --> 08:40.138
No, I'm not talking about
that part of last night.

08:40.221 --> 08:45.310
[stammers] I'm-I'm just feeling that,
Daniela, this is a situation that, um...

08:46.144 --> 08:49.397
Well, maybe it's not
the situation that, um...

08:51.190 --> 08:54.402
Uh, Lito isn't sure
we need a live-in beard.

08:56.362 --> 08:59.240
- Yes, I mean...
- Oh.

09:01.326 --> 09:07.248
I see. So as long as I didn't know
the truth, you were fine with using me,

09:07.332 --> 09:11.836
making me feel like you cared about me,
but... now that I know the truth,

09:11.919 --> 09:16.299
you'd prefer to dump me,
move on and use someone else?

09:16.382 --> 09:18.259
- No, no, no, no.
- Interesting.

09:18.343 --> 09:20.803
I've said the exact same thing to him.

09:20.886 --> 09:22.555
Lito, I like this girl.

09:22.639 --> 09:28.144
- I thought you liked me, too.
- Yes. Yes, I do, Daniela. I...

09:28.227 --> 09:29.937
This is our home.

09:30.021 --> 09:33.107
It's... our sacred space.

09:33.899 --> 09:37.862
Uh... And you know, I'll try to...

09:39.447 --> 09:40.490
I'll try--

09:40.573 --> 09:42.534
- Where he gets to be himself.
- Yes.

09:42.617 --> 09:44.910
I would love to get to know the real you.

09:46.037 --> 09:50.375
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
Um-- You know, this-- [sighs]

09:50.458 --> 09:52.835
- Look, Daniela--
- Whoa.

09:54.754 --> 09:56.964
You saying this, it makes me feel--

09:57.048 --> 09:59.718
I mean, it's--
It's kind of uncomfortable.

09:59.800 --> 10:02.845
- Lito.
- [sighs]

10:03.929 --> 10:08.476
Because you're being honest with me,
I... I want to be honest with you.

10:08.560 --> 10:13.272
Um, there's another reason why
I didn't want to go home last night.

10:13.356 --> 10:15.858
There's this guy. [nervous chuckle]

10:15.941 --> 10:18.778
He knows my family and uh,
he's got it into his head

10:18.861 --> 10:21.155
that he was going to marry me.

10:21.239 --> 10:25.785
But he's not one of those people
that you say "no" to, so I...

10:26.786 --> 10:30.164
I did something, and I just...

10:30.248 --> 10:33.334
I need a place to crash
while things cool down with him.

10:34.877 --> 10:36.337
- What did you do?
- Mm-hm.

10:38.089 --> 10:39.674
Fucked his best friend.

10:57.776 --> 11:01.279
Yo, hero. [chuckles]
You're the man of the hour.

11:01.362 --> 11:03.239
Agent Stiles,
I was just looking for you--

11:03.322 --> 11:06.200
I appreciate your work ethic,
but you shouldn't even be vertical.

11:06.284 --> 11:08.911
- It's about Jonas.
- Yeah, don't worry. We got him.

11:08.994 --> 11:10.789
I want to talk to him.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.540
- You want to what?
- I just--

11:12.624 --> 11:15.042
You need to get back to the hospital
and get your head checked.

11:15.126 --> 11:17.336
Five minutes, that's all I need.

11:17.420 --> 11:19.880
Even I wanted to give you access
to this guy, and I don't,

11:19.964 --> 11:21.173
it's out of my hands.

11:21.257 --> 11:23.175
Homeland Security
sent over a car to pick him up

11:23.259 --> 11:25.762
and transport him over
to another facility for questioning.

11:25.845 --> 11:28.640
- When?
- Well, that's need to know only.

11:28.723 --> 11:31.517
He's on lockdown. Hey, you're a hero.

11:31.601 --> 11:34.562
Enjoy your five minutes of fame,
and stop trying to make six out of it.

11:44.155 --> 11:46.031
Oh, you shouldn't be out of bed.

11:46.115 --> 11:47.784
It's safer for you in the bed.

11:47.867 --> 11:50.953
There's nothing safe about this place.

11:51.036 --> 11:53.080
[woman] We are trying to help you.

11:53.164 --> 11:55.333
I know that you cannot
understand that right now,

11:55.416 --> 11:57.376
but that's because you're unwell.

11:57.460 --> 11:59.545
How can this be legal?

12:00.672 --> 12:02.841
I need you to get back into your bed.

12:02.923 --> 12:06.302
I can't believe that this is
happening to me in the 21st century.

12:06.385 --> 12:09.347
Dr. Metzger needs you
on this medication--

12:09.430 --> 12:11.265
This is like some
crazy witch-burning shit.

12:11.349 --> 12:13.893
--twenty-four hours
before your surgery.

12:13.976 --> 12:17.313
No, I told you,
I won't take any medication.

12:17.396 --> 12:18.898
[sighs]

12:18.981 --> 12:24.529
I've been instructed to use force,
Nomi, if you will not cooperate.

12:24.612 --> 12:27.615
No. No, no. No.

12:27.699 --> 12:29.074
No.

12:33.078 --> 12:35.623
How long do you think
you'll need to stay with us?

12:35.707 --> 12:39.168
As long as it takes for things
between Joaquin and me to cool down.

12:39.251 --> 12:41.295
Joaquin? That's the guy?

12:42.296 --> 12:44.048
What about the best friend?
Where is he?

12:45.049 --> 12:49.011
He and Joaquin... had words.

12:49.637 --> 12:50.930
They had words?

12:51.013 --> 12:53.474
And now I think he's in San Diego.

12:55.184 --> 12:56.644
"They had words."

12:58.145 --> 13:01.023
In a movie, that would mean
someone is in the hospital.

13:01.106 --> 13:03.943
[laughs]
This isn't a movie, Lito.

13:06.612 --> 13:09.824
So, you said Joaquin
was a friend of your family.

13:09.908 --> 13:12.451
He worked for my father
for a long time.

13:12.535 --> 13:14.620
What does your father do?

13:16.205 --> 13:17.289
Import/export.

13:18.791 --> 13:21.377
What does he import/export?

13:23.003 --> 13:24.923
Stuff people want, I guess.

13:30.929 --> 13:34.390
How serious was this thing
between you and Joaquin?

13:35.558 --> 13:39.061
It started my last year
at university in San Diego.

13:40.855 --> 13:42.774
He'd call me every time
he was in town,

13:42.857 --> 13:46.527
and at first, it was fun, casual.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.364
But then he got serious, and...

13:52.450 --> 13:54.285
[clears throat]

13:54.368 --> 13:56.036
My turn.

13:57.162 --> 14:00.666
So, how did you pick me to be your beard?

14:04.796 --> 14:06.965
[softly]
My agent showed me your head shot.

14:07.047 --> 14:08.674
Aw!

14:08.758 --> 14:10.342
You liked my head shot?

14:12.720 --> 14:15.222
It was between you and Gloria Sanchez.

14:15.306 --> 14:18.142
- Gloria Sanchez?
- Yeah.

14:18.225 --> 14:19.518
That skank?

14:19.602 --> 14:21.813
[laughs] Yes.

14:21.896 --> 14:23.689
And what was the tiebreaker?

14:25.775 --> 14:27.318
[softly] Hernando.

14:28.945 --> 14:30.863
He thought you had kind eyes.

14:30.947 --> 14:33.407
Said we'd make a better couple.

14:34.033 --> 14:35.242
[camera shutter clicks]

14:35.326 --> 14:36.953
He's not the only one.

14:45.336 --> 14:47.630
[whispers] Are you enjoying this?

14:47.713 --> 14:51.801
Are you kidding?
This is the best part I've ever had.

14:58.223 --> 15:01.978
[cell phone ringing]

15:07.274 --> 15:10.235
[ringing continues]

15:40.599 --> 15:43.686
[buttons beeping]

16:04.082 --> 16:05.083
[sighs]

17:02.473 --> 17:03.766
[sighs]

17:03.849 --> 17:08.228
Please, Sun,
take care of your brother.

17:10.314 --> 17:13.067
Do this for me.

17:16.695 --> 17:18.072
[sighs]

17:30.168 --> 17:32.377
[girl whispers] Help me.

17:37.008 --> 17:39.135
[whispers] Help me, Will.

18:03.617 --> 18:05.285
[exhales]

18:10.415 --> 18:11.709
[woman] Ms. Bak?

18:12.877 --> 18:16.505
I have Mr. Jeong from Seoul Citibank
on the line again.

18:16.588 --> 18:18.841
He sounded very upset.

18:21.677 --> 18:25.305
He told me to tell you
that if you don't pick up the phone...

18:26.265 --> 18:29.060
his next call will have to be
to the authorities.

18:44.783 --> 18:46.493
I need to speak with my father.

18:46.577 --> 18:49.747
Yes, I know, Ms. Bak.
I have left messages for him.

18:49.830 --> 18:51.207
He has not returned.

18:51.290 --> 18:54.001
Tell me where he is
and I'll go to him.

18:54.085 --> 18:57.671
I can't do that,
because I don't know where he is.

18:57.755 --> 19:00.674
- Do you want to leave another message?
- A message?

19:08.390 --> 19:10.017
[woman gasps]

19:20.194 --> 19:22.404
You're coming with me, aren't you?

19:22.487 --> 19:24.073
- Riley!
- Hey.

19:24.156 --> 19:25.866
Hello, my love.

19:25.950 --> 19:28.702
- Riley, Bambie. Bambie, Riley.
- Hi.

19:28.786 --> 19:30.913
This is, um... this is the one
I was telling you about.

19:30.996 --> 19:32.248
Right! You're a DJ.

19:32.331 --> 19:35.834
- Yeah, you work with Shugs.
- No, no, not a DJ, the DJ.

19:35.918 --> 19:38.629
- Best I ever saw. It was amazing.
- Ah!

19:38.712 --> 19:42.382
Uh, listen, I could use some help.
[nervous chuckle]

19:42.466 --> 19:44.384
Yeah.

19:44.468 --> 19:46.553
Aw, looks like you could use a pint,
to start.

19:46.637 --> 19:48.639
- Yeah.
- You all right?

19:48.722 --> 19:50.266
- [Riley] Mm-hm.
- Come on then.

19:50.349 --> 19:52.268
[Bambie] You sure you're all right?

19:52.351 --> 19:57.481
You see, the problem is
that they look exactly the same.

19:57.564 --> 19:59.984
They come in the same package.

20:01.110 --> 20:05.114
- They have the same identifying features.
- What are you doing here? Are you mad?

20:05.197 --> 20:06.490
- What?
- [man] To the naked eye,

20:06.573 --> 20:09.368
- no different from the real thing.
- Your wedding is in two days.

20:09.451 --> 20:11.745
I'm getting married, not lobotomized.

20:11.829 --> 20:13.998
[woman] The packaging is coated
in quality control.

20:14.081 --> 20:16.083
[softly] If I was marrying that man...

20:16.167 --> 20:20.296
- [man] We believe the counterfeiters...
- ...I'd let him lobotomize me all day.

20:20.379 --> 20:23.132
[man] ...work within companies
like yours...

20:24.258 --> 20:29.429
often substituting
counterfeit drugs for the real ones...

20:29.513 --> 20:30.555
[phone buzzes]

20:30.639 --> 20:34.434
...sometimes just cutting the dose
to cut costs.

20:35.311 --> 20:40.149
But these tampered-with drugs
are killing people

20:40.232 --> 20:42.943
who are not getting
the proper medication.

20:43.027 --> 20:45.529
[overlapping chatter]

20:46.822 --> 20:49.533
- You know, maybe it is not a good idea.
- No, you have to trust me.

20:49.616 --> 20:51.618
These are my people.
We speak the same language.

20:51.702 --> 20:54.246
Supply, demand, gross, net.

20:54.330 --> 20:56.123
- Bottom line, give me your money.
- What?

20:56.207 --> 21:00.378
Give me your money, unless you want your
mother to spend another night in pain.

21:02.754 --> 21:08.802
Yes. One, two, three, four, five...
Eight? Eight hundred bob?

21:08.886 --> 21:11.138
[groans, speaks foreign language]

21:11.222 --> 21:12.723
[sighs]

21:13.891 --> 21:15.642
I do love a challenge.

21:15.726 --> 21:16.894
Whoo!

21:16.977 --> 21:18.437
Hey, hi, my friend.

21:18.520 --> 21:21.606
And how is it going, Mr...?

21:21.690 --> 21:24.068
- Fuck off.
- Oh, you're Mr. Fuck Off.

21:24.151 --> 21:26.528
I mistook you for someone
who wants to make some money.

21:26.611 --> 21:28.155
What I sell here you can't afford.

21:28.239 --> 21:30.824
Oh, is that true? Wait. Phone.

21:30.908 --> 21:33.285
Uh, who's calling? [grunts]

21:33.369 --> 21:35.704
Oh. Yeah?

21:36.830 --> 21:38.374
What?

21:39.917 --> 21:41.919
No, I'm here now.

21:42.002 --> 21:43.795
No, you gave this address.

21:44.713 --> 21:48.717
Yes. No, this-- Construction site down--

21:48.800 --> 21:50.719
Come on, G.

21:50.802 --> 21:52.846
[speaks foreign language]

21:53.847 --> 21:56.183
Sorry, guys, wrong place. Let us go.

21:56.267 --> 21:59.937
- I thought this was Gorgo's.
- Gorgo? That guy's merch is shit.

22:00.020 --> 22:03.065
Is that true?
He said that your shit's totally cut.

22:03.148 --> 22:06.485
Fuck him. I sell the cleanest drugs
in the whole of Nairobi.

22:06.568 --> 22:07.778
Everybody knows it.

22:07.861 --> 22:10.489
Sure, Fuck Off, whatever you say.

22:11.407 --> 22:13.658
Come, what do you need?

22:13.742 --> 22:16.661
- Well, uh--
- My mother is sick with AIDS

22:16.745 --> 22:18.914
and the medicine she's taking
is making her sicker.

22:18.997 --> 22:21.750
AIDS medicine don't make people sick.

22:21.833 --> 22:25.421
It's counterfeit and watered-down
medicine that has side effects.

22:25.504 --> 22:30.509
Cramps, diarrhea, pain. Mostly pain.

22:30.592 --> 22:35.931
She needs Lortab, Norco.
But this is very expensive.

22:37.266 --> 22:39.059
Cheaper to let her die.

22:39.143 --> 22:41.103
- Fuck--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hey, relax.

22:41.186 --> 22:44.315
Hey. No, relax. Easy, easy.

22:44.398 --> 22:46.484
Wait, wait, wait, wait,
some of his jokes.

22:46.566 --> 22:48.277
Just relax. Relax!

22:49.903 --> 22:51.447
How much for the Norco?

22:51.530 --> 22:53.573
- Twenty-five.
- What?

22:53.657 --> 22:56.452
Gorgo's got it online
for half that price.

22:57.828 --> 23:00.789
- Let's go.
- Hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

23:00.872 --> 23:02.500
- Ten-fifty.
- Six-fifty.

23:02.582 --> 23:05.877
- Are you trying to fuck with me?
- Fuck, Mr. Fuck Off?

23:06.711 --> 23:09.089
- OK, nine.
- Eight.

23:12.217 --> 23:13.427
Deal.

23:31.362 --> 23:32.404
My money.

23:32.530 --> 23:35.366
Why don't you pick it up yourself
and uh... fuck off?

23:35.449 --> 23:38.327
- [laughing]
- [rattles pills]

23:39.370 --> 23:42.080
Should try what I did
when me and my ex broke up.

23:42.164 --> 23:45.501
I snuck into our flat
and put super glue on the toilet seat.

23:45.584 --> 23:48.045
Firemen had to come
and cut him away from the loo.

23:48.128 --> 23:50.255
Fucking cunt hobbled
to the emergency room

23:50.339 --> 23:52.966
with half the dunny
hanging off his ass. [cackles]

23:54.593 --> 23:57.888
Don't mind Bambie, Riley.
She can be a bit forward.

23:59.348 --> 24:02.809
I actually think she's got
a touch of Asperger's.

24:02.893 --> 24:04.936
Asperger's?

24:05.020 --> 24:07.647
I don't have Asperger's.

24:07.731 --> 24:09.608
I'm fuckin' Australian.

24:09.691 --> 24:12.236
[sputters, laughs]

24:12.319 --> 24:15.072
Whose side are you on?
He threw her out on the street.

24:17.657 --> 24:20.452
Look, I never fancied ol' Jacko.

24:20.536 --> 24:23.914
He was a dickhead.
You do deserve better.

24:35.926 --> 24:37.761
[spurs clinking]

24:39.679 --> 24:42.266
Tino! Tino, please!

24:42.349 --> 24:44.602
Don't do this! Please.

24:44.684 --> 24:46.520
- Please, don't go in there.
- I must.

24:46.604 --> 24:49.273
- Please, I beg of--
- I must.

24:49.356 --> 24:50.815
My destiny is a bullet.

24:51.775 --> 24:54.361
The one I put in him or the one...

24:54.445 --> 24:57.197
- [mouths silently]
- [Lito] ...he puts in me.

24:59.408 --> 25:01.868
And that's a cut!

25:01.952 --> 25:03.995
Eh! Very nice! Yes!

25:04.079 --> 25:05.372
Lito, beautiful.

25:05.456 --> 25:07.583
Thank you very much, eh? OK.

25:07.666 --> 25:08.917
- Are you sure you got it?
- Yes.

25:09.000 --> 25:10.377
Can I do one more, please?

25:10.461 --> 25:14.590
I was thinking, should I be playing here
that she's gonna betray me?

25:15.466 --> 25:17.342
No, you don't know. How could you know?

25:17.426 --> 25:20.429
Listen, listen... I know.

25:20.512 --> 25:22.806
- [bell tolling]
- I think my character might feel it.

25:22.889 --> 25:27.060
The audience doesn't know.
The audience is with you. They are you.

25:27.144 --> 25:29.020
When you know, they know.

25:31.022 --> 25:32.732
But I do know.

25:34.776 --> 25:36.361
Know what, love?

25:37.529 --> 25:40.031
- [bell continues tolling]
- Nothing.

25:41.116 --> 25:43.160
You gotta go through that door.

25:43.243 --> 25:45.829
There's nowhere else for you to go.

25:47.247 --> 25:51.710
Now, walk with me.
There's someone you need to meet.

25:53.753 --> 25:59.426
[Shugs] Um, welcome to my humble abode.
El palacio el Shugsio.

26:02.638 --> 26:04.055
[bell stops tolling]

26:04.139 --> 26:08.101
So, Lito, this is Mr. Flores.

26:10.228 --> 26:13.940
Please... call me Joaquin.

26:15.734 --> 26:17.402
Joaquin?

26:19.530 --> 26:21.156
How do you guys know each other?

26:21.239 --> 26:24.075
I'm a really good friend
of Mr. Moreno.

26:24.159 --> 26:26.911
You know, the guy who signs our checks?
[chuckles]

26:26.995 --> 26:29.080
He wants to take you out to lunch.

26:29.164 --> 26:31.082
Between us, he's a big fan.

26:32.125 --> 26:35.253
I've watched The Passion of the Sinner
a thousand times.

26:35.337 --> 26:39.132
And if it's on,
I always watch it till the end.

26:41.176 --> 26:42.844
You're my hero.

26:47.015 --> 26:50.227
Do you know what Mitchie said about you?

26:50.310 --> 26:54.314
He says, "Shugs,
there's two reasons to go to Iceland:

26:54.398 --> 26:57.901
the aurora borealis, and Riley Blue.

26:57.984 --> 27:04.241
One is a natural phenomenon
so beautiful it will blow your mind,

27:04.324 --> 27:07.869
and the other is just
some pretty lights in the sky."

27:07.952 --> 27:09.829
[soft chuckle]

27:10.830 --> 27:12.457
Thanks, Shugs.

27:13.584 --> 27:15.252
You're from Iceland?

27:17.837 --> 27:19.464
Do you miss it?

27:21.383 --> 27:23.009
I miss my dad.

27:24.636 --> 27:26.263
He's a pianist.

27:26.346 --> 27:28.724
I miss listening to him practice.

27:28.807 --> 27:30.809
[Shugs] Mm. My dad was a drunk,

27:30.892 --> 27:34.605
and I miss the way we'd find him sleeping
in a different place every morning.

27:34.688 --> 27:38.149
[chuckles]
Chip off the old block, this one.

27:41.111 --> 27:42.821
[Shugs] What else?

27:45.198 --> 27:46.908
I miss the winter.

27:47.992 --> 27:50.203
Just so quiet and still...

27:52.706 --> 27:54.750
you can hear your own heart beat.

27:54.833 --> 27:57.377
I'd go balmy in so much darkness.

27:58.420 --> 28:03.133
Actually, most Icelanders go crazy
in the spring when the sun comes back.

28:03.216 --> 28:06.928
I know so many people who
tried to kill themselves in the spring.

28:12.100 --> 28:13.518
That when you tried?

28:16.020 --> 28:19.023
Sorry, love. Australian.

28:21.067 --> 28:24.154
Hey, Riles... look.

28:25.823 --> 28:27.157
[clears throat]

28:28.408 --> 28:32.078
Every time I wake up in hospital and
someone tells me I'm lucky to be alive,

28:32.162 --> 28:34.164
I get another one.

28:36.291 --> 28:40.879
Riley, anyone watching
what really goes on in this world,

28:40.962 --> 28:43.423
how fucked up it all is...

28:45.843 --> 28:51.431
like... checking out,
temporarily, permanently...

28:52.808 --> 28:57.020
my darling, it is the only choice
that makes any sense.

29:13.662 --> 29:15.706
[cell phone ringing]

29:19.668 --> 29:20.836
[sighs]

29:24.464 --> 29:25.590
I'll walk.

29:28.886 --> 29:31.304
[cell phone ringing]

29:42.941 --> 29:48.196
What you actors do, playing all those
different people, is amazing.

29:50.824 --> 29:53.952
Actors are just good liars, Joaquin.

29:54.035 --> 29:55.871
One of my favorite scenes

29:55.954 --> 29:59.624
was that one where you
killed your father when he's sleeping.

29:59.708 --> 30:01.626
Our Father Who Art in Hell.

30:01.710 --> 30:03.962
Exactly. That one.

30:04.045 --> 30:07.424
You walked up to him,
cover his mouth,

30:07.507 --> 30:11.553
and you say, "No more lies."

30:11.636 --> 30:15.974
And then you drag the knife
through his throat.

30:18.643 --> 30:22.397
Wow! How did you do that?

30:22.480 --> 30:23.982
What do you mean?

30:24.065 --> 30:25.734
[mimics blood gushing]

30:25.817 --> 30:28.695
It's a prosthetic.

30:28.779 --> 30:32.031
- Oh.
- It's a fake neck that gets cut.

30:32.115 --> 30:35.368
Ah. I love it. Really, I love it.

30:36.035 --> 30:38.204
But listen, you cannot
kill a man like that.

30:39.289 --> 30:41.249
If you want to do it right,

30:41.332 --> 30:43.042
you aim here...

30:44.210 --> 30:46.254
for the jugular. Huh?

30:46.337 --> 30:48.715
Otherwise, you have
to hack through the windpipe,

30:48.799 --> 30:52.636
then the neck bone, and things
can get really, really, messy.

30:52.719 --> 30:56.431
A lot of thrashing around
till they drown in their own blood.

30:59.058 --> 31:01.060
Something of an expert, then?

31:03.271 --> 31:04.898
It's more like a hobby.

31:08.902 --> 31:10.111
Look...

31:11.822 --> 31:13.490
you know why I'm here, don't you?

31:16.576 --> 31:18.787
You're fucking the love of my life.

31:20.914 --> 31:22.958
When I heard she was seeing someone...

31:25.168 --> 31:27.879
and I'm gonna be
really honest with you, Lito...

31:28.755 --> 31:31.967
it drove me a little bit loco,

31:32.050 --> 31:36.972
because I couldn't stop thinking
of how we used to lay in bed

31:37.055 --> 31:40.475
and look at the selfies
she took with her past lovers,

31:40.558 --> 31:42.560
and how we used to make fun of them.

31:48.483 --> 31:49.943
[laughing]

31:54.031 --> 31:56.908
But it turned out to be you.
[laughs]

31:56.992 --> 31:59.077
So what could I do?

31:59.160 --> 32:02.873
If I were a girl,
I would also love to fuck you.

32:06.668 --> 32:11.673
I want to know just one thing,
and then you will never see me again.

32:15.468 --> 32:17.261
Is she happy?

32:19.514 --> 32:20.974
Yes.

32:21.808 --> 32:24.019
She told me she's never been happier.

32:30.734 --> 32:32.110
You did it.

32:34.445 --> 32:36.489
Just like I show you.

32:37.448 --> 32:39.034
Right for the jugular.

32:42.787 --> 32:45.164
But you should have used a knife.

32:48.960 --> 32:50.461
[silverware clatters]

32:55.050 --> 32:57.052
This is under production.

32:58.636 --> 33:00.013
It's free.
You don't have to pay.

33:00.097 --> 33:03.224
Sooner or later, we all have to pay.

33:11.024 --> 33:12.650
[sobbing]

33:19.449 --> 33:21.701
[whimpers, sobbing]

33:23.453 --> 33:29.167
[softly] Somebody...
Somebody help me, please.

33:32.378 --> 33:34.464
I knew you would be back.

33:35.506 --> 33:37.508
This is where you belong.

33:38.342 --> 33:39.844
You can pretend.

33:39.928 --> 33:42.847
You can act the way others
want you to act.

33:42.931 --> 33:44.891
You can bury your heart.

33:46.517 --> 33:50.229
But I know you will always come back.

33:57.654 --> 33:58.655
Good.

34:01.950 --> 34:05.745
[heart monitor beeps steadily]

34:10.917 --> 34:12.418
OK, put her under.

34:14.838 --> 34:17.465
[alarm beeping in distance]

34:19.759 --> 34:21.636
- [alarm blaring]
- What the hell is going on?

34:24.222 --> 34:25.598
The fire department is proceeding

34:25.682 --> 34:27.976
with a non-critical evacuation
of the building.

34:28.059 --> 34:30.645
Some lunatic set fire
to the visitors' room.

34:32.689 --> 34:35.608
This patient's under medical quarantine.
Get her back in the room.

34:41.072 --> 34:42.365
[Neets] It's gonna be OK.

34:42.448 --> 34:45.576
Something is going on,
I don't know what it is, but until we do,

34:45.660 --> 34:49.747
I will burn this building down before
I let anyone touch that beautiful brain.

34:50.456 --> 34:53.251
Oh... Thank you, Neets.

34:53.334 --> 34:55.253
[weak chuckle]

34:55.336 --> 34:56.796
Thank you.

34:58.589 --> 35:00.341
[whispers] Thank you.

35:11.978 --> 35:14.147
Hey, you promised no stopping here.
Bad area.

35:14.231 --> 35:16.149
We aren't full.
We need the money.

35:20.528 --> 35:21.738
See?

35:27.994 --> 35:29.453
Oh, shit!
