00:30.800 --> 00:33.960
Want to take a walk with me?

01:16.360 --> 01:20.000
...continue to protest the presence
of a convicted sex offender

01:20.040 --> 01:22.400
in their neighborhood.
Michelle Betler reports.

01:22.440 --> 01:25.040
Thanks, Rick. I'm standing here
on Woodward Court,

01:25.080 --> 01:26.680
the quiet residential
street

01:26.720 --> 01:28.800
that has become
the focus of controversy

01:28.840 --> 01:31.920
ever since 48-year-old
Ronald James McGorvey returned here

01:31.960 --> 01:33.680
after serving a two-year
prison sentence

01:33.720 --> 01:35.680
for indecent exposure
to a minor.

01:35.720 --> 01:37.640
In the past few days
an organization

01:37.680 --> 01:39.720
known as the Committee
of Concerned Parents

01:39.760 --> 01:42.760
began distributing these notices
throughout the community

01:42.800 --> 01:44.960
warning neighbors
of what they call a quote,

01:45.000 --> 01:46.920
"Dangerous predator
in our midst."

01:46.960 --> 01:50.280
I don't really like having
him that close to my family.

01:50.320 --> 01:53.800
I think it's outrageous.
This block has too many children

01:53.880 --> 01:56.720
for a sex offender to, uh, be
moving in the neighborhood.

01:56.760 --> 01:58.520
I-- I don't think
it's a good idea.

01:58.560 --> 02:00.880
Makes me very nervous.
Makes me a little enraged.

02:00.920 --> 02:03.800
Um, I'd have a problem
if I see him on the street.

02:03.840 --> 02:06.000
It's like having an
alcoholic work in a bar.

02:06.000 --> 02:08.279
They don't mix.
They shouldn't be together.

02:08.320 --> 02:11.360
The conditions of his parole
expressly forbid McGorvey

02:11.400 --> 02:13.440
to be within 100 yards
of any playground,

02:13.480 --> 02:16.960
school or recreation area
where children normally gather.

02:17.000 --> 02:18.920
These conditions seem
to be of little comfort

02:18.960 --> 02:21.480
to the many parents whose
children play and go to school

02:21.520 --> 02:23.280
in this formerly
tranquil community,

02:23.280 --> 02:26.560
and who in the coming days and weeks
will be hoping for the best

02:26.600 --> 02:29.320
but preparing for the worst.
Rick, back to you.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.600
My husband and I had an
actual spiritual experience.

02:42.640 --> 02:45.720
We did this intense
spa treatment--

02:45.760 --> 02:47.360
- Oh, come on.
- No, listen to me.

02:47.400 --> 02:50.640
It was on our vacation in Cabo
and there were eight other couples

02:50.640 --> 02:52.720
and this Mayan woman.

02:52.760 --> 02:54.760
A goddess,
just a goddess.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.200
- She had--
- She's due in September.

02:56.240 --> 02:58.680
She thinks she's gonna
take three months off,

02:58.720 --> 03:01.240
then it's Christmas, then she'll be back
to work the first of the year.

03:01.280 --> 03:02.760
Please.

03:02.800 --> 03:05.680
Six months from now she'll be right here
on this bench with us.

03:05.680 --> 03:07.520
My friend Beth said
that the way she did it

03:07.560 --> 03:10.760
was to just take him with her every time
she went to the bathroom.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.720
- I find that strange.
- Yeah, that's what I said to Beth.

03:13.760 --> 03:15.120
It's Oedipal.

03:15.160 --> 03:17.040
What's the rush?

03:17.040 --> 03:20.040
Although I will say, when I was trying
to potty-train Christian,

03:20.080 --> 03:22.760
I opened the diaper
and it was huge!

03:22.800 --> 03:24.480
Like a grown man.

03:24.520 --> 03:28.000
Smiling politely to mask a
familiar feeling of desperation

03:28.040 --> 03:31.760
Sarah reminded herself to think
like an anthropologist.

03:31.800 --> 03:35.680
She was a researcher studying the
behavior of typical suburban women.

03:35.720 --> 03:37.200
They weren't organic?

03:37.240 --> 03:40.120
She was not a typical
suburban woman herself.

03:40.160 --> 03:42.320
Troy, stop that!

03:42.320 --> 03:43.760
Paul and I were having
sex the other night

03:43.760 --> 03:45.800
and I drifted off
right in the middle of it.

03:45.840 --> 03:47.600
It happens.

03:47.640 --> 03:50.640
Yeah, I guess.
But when I woke up and apologized

03:50.680 --> 03:52.440
he said he hadn't
even noticed.

03:52.480 --> 03:54.160
You know what
you should do?

03:54.160 --> 03:56.720
Set aside a specific
block of time for it.

03:56.760 --> 03:59.440
That's what Louis and I do--
every Tuesday night at 9:00.

03:59.480 --> 04:01.440
"Whether you want to or not"
Sarah thought,

04:01.480 --> 04:03.760
her eyes straying over
to the play area.

04:05.200 --> 04:07.880
Even at such a tiny
playground as this

04:07.920 --> 04:10.960
Lucy didn't interact much
with the other children.

04:11.000 --> 04:13.400
Sarah didn't really know why
they even bothered coming here,

04:13.440 --> 04:15.400
except that she'd
probably go crazy

04:15.440 --> 04:17.120
trapped in the house
all day

04:17.159 --> 04:19.240
with this unknowable
little person.

04:26.160 --> 04:27.920
Morning snack time
was 10:30 on the dot...

04:27.920 --> 04:30.080
Snack time!

04:30.120 --> 04:32.680
...a regimen established
and maintained by Mary Ann,

04:32.720 --> 04:35.280
who believed that rigid
adherence to a timetable

04:35.320 --> 04:37.160
was not only the key
to a healthy marriage,

04:37.200 --> 04:39.160
but to effective
parenting as well.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.680
- I'll take this one!
- I want that one!

04:43.760 --> 04:46.840
- Can I do it?
- Yeah. Ready?

04:49.640 --> 04:52.200
Mommy...

04:52.240 --> 04:54.120
where's my snack?

04:54.160 --> 04:56.440
I'm sorry, honey,
Mommy can't find it.

04:56.480 --> 04:58.640
- I forgot the rice cakes.
- Poor thing.

04:58.680 --> 05:00.680
- I'm sure it's in here somewhere.
- Second time this week.

05:00.720 --> 05:02.520
Well, who's going to keep
track of everything?

05:02.560 --> 05:04.720
- Bad mommy. Bad mommy.
- Just calm down, please.

05:04.760 --> 05:08.400
No calm down!
I want my snack!

05:08.400 --> 05:10.680
All right, you know what?
It's--

05:10.720 --> 05:13.480
it's just not here, okay?
See for yourself.

05:16.720 --> 05:18.320
Wait!

05:18.320 --> 05:21.160
Troy, honey,
give Lucy your goldfish.

05:21.200 --> 05:22.880
No!

05:22.920 --> 05:24.600
Troy Jonathan,
give me those goldfish!

05:24.640 --> 05:26.040
But, Mama, they're mine.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.520
No back talk.
You can share with your sister.

05:28.560 --> 05:30.680
Troy has goldfish for you.
Go sit down.

05:30.720 --> 05:32.760
That's much more than 10.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.160
- That's great.
- Look how big I made my lawn.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.600
Thank you, Mary Ann,
you're a life saver.

05:37.640 --> 05:40.840
It's nothing.
I just hate to see her suffer like that.

05:42.440 --> 05:44.880
Maybe you should make
a checklist and tape it to the door

05:44.920 --> 05:47.320
so it's the last thing you
see before leaving the house.

05:47.360 --> 05:49.400
That's what I do.

05:49.440 --> 05:53.040
Yeah, thank you. That's-- that's
a really helpful suggestion.

05:54.600 --> 05:56.080
You're welcome.

05:56.120 --> 05:58.240
Drink your juice.

05:58.280 --> 06:00.040
Are you the plane again?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.320
Look.

06:01.360 --> 06:03.720
Now you have to act like me.

06:03.760 --> 06:06.040
The prom king.

06:06.080 --> 06:09.480
Oh my God,
he's back.

06:09.520 --> 06:11.280
Sarah followed
the other women's gazes

06:11.280 --> 06:12.640
over to the entrance
of the playground,

06:12.680 --> 06:15.760
eager to finally get a glimpse
of the prom king,

06:15.800 --> 06:18.240
the handsome and mysterious
young father

06:18.280 --> 06:20.400
who had been a regular
at the Walker Street playground

06:20.400 --> 06:22.960
for several weeks
this past spring

06:23.000 --> 06:25.960
before abruptly
dropping out of sight.

06:26.000 --> 06:29.560
I don't need a rest.
I need an airplane ride.

06:29.600 --> 06:32.520
His departure had left a gaping
hole in the emotional lives

06:32.560 --> 06:34.880
of Cheryl, Theresa
and Mary Ann.

06:34.920 --> 06:37.880
Barely a day went by without one
of them speculating wistfully

06:37.920 --> 06:41.320
about the reason for his absence
and the likelihood of his return.

06:43.200 --> 06:47.280
Here I come.
There's no room for two of us, diesel.

06:47.280 --> 06:49.640
You've done it again.

06:49.680 --> 06:51.240
I hate steam engines.

06:51.280 --> 06:54.080
When I come back I will
pinch you with my pinchers.

06:54.120 --> 06:57.520
Yeah?
Well, when I come back

06:57.560 --> 06:59.200
I'm gonna ram you
with my rammer.

06:59.240 --> 07:01.040
- Ready?
- No, you won't.

07:03.440 --> 07:07.720
Every time you win,
diesel!

07:07.760 --> 07:10.520
I know.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.160
- Hello!
- Mommy's home.

07:13.200 --> 07:16.000
The jester's cap was something
that truly disturbed Brad.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.200
All day long the boy ate,
played and napped in it.

07:19.240 --> 07:23.080
But the moment his mother stepped in
the house he had no more use for it.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.400
As if the entire day
up to that point

07:25.440 --> 07:28.240
had been a pointless
and somewhat useless charade.

07:28.280 --> 07:30.320
You got some sun
today, didn't you?

07:30.360 --> 07:33.000
Did Daddy forget
the sunscreen again?

07:34.680 --> 07:37.320
What are you doing?

07:37.360 --> 07:40.680
That's his full name.
What's your favorite thing about him?

07:40.720 --> 07:43.080
Um...

07:43.120 --> 07:45.400
I like to come over
to his house.

07:45.440 --> 07:46.800
Hmm.

07:49.680 --> 07:53.000
I think I'm gonna finally break down
and get a cellphone.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.120
- Really?
- Mmm.

07:55.160 --> 07:56.560
Why?

07:59.760 --> 08:01.800
I have no way of reaching you
when I'm out with Aaron.

08:01.840 --> 08:03.120
You're done,
right?

08:05.240 --> 08:07.280
You've got one.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.200
Don't you think it's
strange that I don't?

08:09.200 --> 08:12.920
Yeah, I do.
You just never wanted one before.

08:12.960 --> 08:15.160
Yeah, I know.

08:15.200 --> 08:18.600
There's a family plan.
We can talk for free.

08:20.480 --> 08:22.160
Okay.

08:22.200 --> 08:24.680
Let's just see where we are
at the end of the month.

08:24.720 --> 08:26.280
Yeah?

08:26.320 --> 08:29.360
Are your hands okay?

08:43.960 --> 08:46.200
As was her custom each week
night after dinner,

08:46.240 --> 08:49.400
the boy's mother sent Brad
down to the municipal library

08:49.440 --> 08:52.400
to study for the bar exam.

08:52.440 --> 08:55.640
But he never quite made it through
the door of the building.

08:58.320 --> 09:01.640
Brad had been watching
the skateboarders for weeks now,

09:01.680 --> 09:04.120
sometimes for as long
as an hour at a stretch.

09:04.160 --> 09:07.200
But he never received the slightest
acknowledgement from any of them.

09:08.720 --> 09:12.520
He'd been the same age as these
boys when his mother died.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.600
- You do that!
- No way!

09:14.640 --> 09:16.640
- Nice.
- Hey, that was nice, dude!

09:16.680 --> 09:19.320
"I must have been like this,"
Brad sometimes thought.

09:19.360 --> 09:23.400
"I must have been
one of them."

09:26.760 --> 09:28.080
Awful.

09:29.880 --> 09:32.160
He should be castrated.

09:32.200 --> 09:33.840
Quick and clean,
just chop it off.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.080
Then you wouldn't have to worry
about notifying the neighbors.

09:36.080 --> 09:37.880
You know what else
you should do?

09:37.920 --> 09:40.840
Nail his penis above the entrance
to the elementary school.

09:40.880 --> 09:43.480
You know, as a warning
to other perverts.

09:43.520 --> 09:45.240
You think
this is funny?

09:45.280 --> 09:48.680
I just can't believe you want to
castrate a man for indecent exposure.

09:48.720 --> 09:51.440
My brother used
to expose himself when--

09:51.480 --> 09:53.840
when we were teenagers.
He'd do it in my bedroom,

09:53.840 --> 09:56.320
he'd do it in the dining room,
he'd do it in the back seat of a car.

09:56.360 --> 09:59.640
He'd always figure out a way to do it so
that nobody could see him except me.

09:59.680 --> 10:01.800
Didn't you
tell anyone?

10:01.840 --> 10:03.720
No, I didn't want
to get him in trouble.

10:03.760 --> 10:05.560
Maybe he should
be castrated.

10:07.360 --> 10:10.080
It's not the same thing.
He wasn't doing it to strangers.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.760
Oh my God, there he is.

10:12.800 --> 10:15.320
After all this time,
two days in a row.

10:15.360 --> 10:16.800
Where's the fire?

10:16.840 --> 10:19.400
Maybe he needed a vacation.

10:19.440 --> 10:21.760
From what?

10:21.800 --> 10:23.880
From being
the prom king.

10:23.920 --> 10:26.200
It's a dirty job,
but someone's gotta do it.

10:29.720 --> 10:31.840
- Close it?
- Close it.

10:31.880 --> 10:35.000
Close the gate.
There you go.

10:35.040 --> 10:37.480
- It's open.
- It's all right.

10:37.520 --> 10:40.520
- Somebody else will close it.
- Are we practicing?

10:42.640 --> 10:45.280
Are we playing
up on the swings?

10:45.320 --> 10:47.280
Swing time!

10:52.040 --> 10:53.800
What's he do for a living?

10:53.840 --> 10:57.400
We've never actually
spoken to him.

10:57.440 --> 10:58.760
Really?

10:58.800 --> 11:01.080
We don't even
know his name.

11:01.120 --> 11:04.120
I thought you guys said
he was a regular here.

11:04.160 --> 11:06.320
- It was awkward.
- He made us nervous.

11:06.320 --> 11:09.400
You had to think about what you
were gonna wear in the morning.

11:09.440 --> 11:12.000
You know, put on makeup.
It was exhausting.

11:20.880 --> 11:23.160
Mommy, push me!

11:23.200 --> 11:26.720
Okay.
I'll be right there.

11:29.760 --> 11:33.000
Wait!

11:33.040 --> 11:35.160
Five bucks if you get
his phone number.

11:41.680 --> 11:44.080
How old is she?

11:44.120 --> 11:45.560
Lucy,

11:45.600 --> 11:48.360
tell the nice boy
how old you are.

11:48.400 --> 11:50.720
I'm three.

11:50.760 --> 11:52.960
My grandma
lives in New Jersey.

11:53.000 --> 11:55.920
She doesn't have
a swim pool.

11:55.960 --> 11:57.480
Do you like to swim?

11:57.520 --> 12:00.720
I don't like sharks.
They eat you up.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.640
Don't listen to him.

12:02.680 --> 12:05.920
We go to the town pool
almost every day.

12:05.960 --> 12:09.360
- I'm Brad, by the way.
- Sarah.

12:09.400 --> 12:11.640
You guys come
here a lot?

12:11.680 --> 12:14.200
No, just the last
few weeks.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.400
I usually go to the one
over on Harris,

12:16.400 --> 12:18.640
with the big wood things,
you know, and the slide across.

12:18.640 --> 12:20.280
Yeah, we actually rent a house
right around the corner

12:20.320 --> 12:21.720
from there on Ashforth.

12:21.760 --> 12:24.640
That ice cream truck never leaves.
Such a nightmare.

12:24.680 --> 12:28.200
Yeah, tell me about it.

12:28.240 --> 12:30.880
You know, you're the first person
here who's ever talked to me.

12:32.680 --> 12:35.800
You make 'em nervous.

12:35.840 --> 12:38.320
Oh, right.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.560
I guess they don't see too many fathers
here during the weekdays.

12:44.840 --> 12:46.880
You don't have to be polite.
Go ahead and ask.

12:46.920 --> 12:48.720
What?

12:48.720 --> 12:51.800
You know, what the person who wears the
pants in the family does for a living.

12:51.840 --> 12:55.080
Oh. All right,
what does your wife do?

12:55.120 --> 12:58.400
- She makes documentaries.
- Oh, wow.

12:58.440 --> 13:01.200
- Like Michael Moore?
- Uh, like PBS.

13:01.240 --> 13:03.720
Oh.

13:03.760 --> 13:05.720
Well, I think it's
admirable you're here.

13:05.760 --> 13:08.480
There's no reason fathers
can't be primary caregivers.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.560
I finished law school
two years ago,

13:12.560 --> 13:15.920
but I can't seem to pass the bar exam.
Failed it twice now.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.520
Maybe you just don't
want to be a lawyer.

13:23.120 --> 13:24.880
I'll take the test
one more time.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.520
If I mess up now

13:26.560 --> 13:30.560
I'll just have to find something else
to do with my life.

13:30.600 --> 13:33.040
- Right, buddy?
- Right.

13:33.080 --> 13:36.240
Sarah was shocked by how Brad
delivered this confession,

13:36.240 --> 13:39.840
with no apparent sense of being in the
least bit embarrassed by his failure.

13:39.880 --> 13:42.440
Most men weren't like this.

13:42.480 --> 13:45.280
Her husband Richard
certainly wasn't.

13:45.320 --> 13:47.920
She wondered if Brad was
always this forthcoming.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.680
If anything,
he seemed a little lonely,

13:50.720 --> 13:54.120
all too ready to open his heart at
the slightest sign of interest,

13:54.160 --> 13:56.640
like a lot of young
mothers she knew.

13:56.680 --> 13:59.200
I couldn't help noticing
your stroller.

13:59.240 --> 14:01.400
Do you have
another child?

14:01.440 --> 14:04.160
No, just Aaron.
Got that at a yard sale.

14:04.200 --> 14:07.480
Extra seat comes in handy
for the bear, though.

14:07.520 --> 14:10.520
Lucy refuses to go
in a stroller or a car seat.

14:10.560 --> 14:13.840
We have to walk everywhere. It takes us
half an hour to go three blocks,

14:13.840 --> 14:15.520
unless I carry her.

14:15.560 --> 14:19.120
- Daddy, I'm finished.
- Are you sure? We just got here.

14:19.160 --> 14:21.640
I'm finished right now.

14:21.680 --> 14:24.200
Okay. All right,
here we go.

14:24.240 --> 14:27.200
Ready?
One, two, three.

14:27.240 --> 14:28.920
- Oops.
- Oh, hold on for a second.

14:28.960 --> 14:30.240
- There, thank you.
- Are you okay?

14:30.280 --> 14:32.080
No problem.

14:32.080 --> 14:35.080
It was then while watching Brad
kneel down at his son's feet

14:35.120 --> 14:39.760
that Sarah found herself gripped by
an unexpected pang of sadness.

14:39.760 --> 14:42.680
"Don't go," she thought.

14:42.720 --> 14:46.280
"Don't leave me here
with the others."

14:46.320 --> 14:50.000
- It was nice talking to you.
- Same here.

14:50.000 --> 14:53.080
Wait! Um...

14:53.120 --> 14:54.960
Come here. Just...

14:55.000 --> 14:57.000
come here.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.000
You see those women
over there?

15:01.040 --> 15:03.040
Just, yeah, don't--
don't look.

15:03.080 --> 15:05.840
You know what
they call you?

15:05.880 --> 15:07.200
What?

15:07.240 --> 15:09.440
The prom king.

15:09.480 --> 15:11.080
Oh God, really?

15:11.120 --> 15:13.480
Yeah, they mean it
as a compliment.

15:13.520 --> 15:15.880
You're a big character
in their fantasy lives.

15:15.920 --> 15:17.320
Wow.

15:17.360 --> 15:20.560
Um, so one of them bet me $5
I couldn't get your phone number.

15:20.560 --> 15:23.240
Five bucks, huh?

15:23.280 --> 15:25.080
Yeah.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.440
Could we split
it 50-50?

15:27.440 --> 15:29.440
It could be
arranged.

15:29.480 --> 15:30.880
It doesn't have to be
your real number.

15:30.920 --> 15:33.440
Oh, well, you know, in that case, sure.
You got a pen?

15:33.480 --> 15:36.600
Great. Oh shit, no I--
um, no I don't.

15:36.640 --> 15:38.480
- Uh...
- Well...

15:38.520 --> 15:40.520
No wait, just--
wait.

15:40.560 --> 15:43.720
You know what'd
really be funny?

15:43.760 --> 15:46.640
If you gave me a hug.

15:46.680 --> 15:49.880
- You think?
- Yeah.

15:49.920 --> 15:52.240
- Yeah.
- All right, come here.

15:53.440 --> 15:55.680
Oh my God.

15:57.160 --> 16:00.320
Do you want to really
freak them out?

16:00.360 --> 16:01.720
Yeah.

16:01.760 --> 16:03.680
Who's gonna talk in there?

16:05.640 --> 16:06.720
- Oh my God!
- Troy!

16:06.760 --> 16:08.240
- Lucy!
- Isabelle!

16:08.280 --> 16:10.960
Isabelle! Come here, Isabelle.
Okay, we have to go.

16:10.960 --> 16:12.760
- Isabelle!
- Troy!

16:12.800 --> 16:15.760
- I think that worked.
- Yeah, I think so.

16:15.800 --> 16:19.320
- Um, well, it was nice meeting you.
- Yeah.

16:19.360 --> 16:21.760
It's okay, yeah.
We're gonna go.

16:21.800 --> 16:23.840
- It's all right.
- Lucy?

16:23.880 --> 16:25.680
We're gonna go home.

16:25.720 --> 16:28.080
Okay, here we go,
good girl.

16:28.120 --> 16:29.880
Good girl.

16:32.160 --> 16:34.560
I'm sure your daughter
found that very educational.

16:34.600 --> 16:36.000
His name is Brad.
He's a lawyer

16:36.040 --> 16:38.640
and he's really very nice.

16:42.320 --> 16:44.440
For the past few days
Sarah hadn't been able

16:44.480 --> 16:47.000
to concentrate on anything
but the prom king

16:47.040 --> 16:49.000
and the curious thing
that had happened

16:49.040 --> 16:50.920
between them
on the playground.

16:52.280 --> 16:54.840
She didn't feel
shame or guilt,

16:54.880 --> 16:58.280
only a sense of profound
disorientation,

16:58.320 --> 17:00.440
as if she had been
kidnapped by aliens

17:00.480 --> 17:03.720
then released unharmed
a few hours later.

17:19.638 --> 17:21.839
As he had so often
in recent days,

17:21.878 --> 17:25.520
Brad mentally reenacted
the kiss by the swing set.

17:25.560 --> 17:27.920
He still couldn't believe
it had really happened.

17:27.960 --> 17:29.640
And with all those women
and children watching.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.920
Troy! Troy!

17:30.960 --> 17:33.880
Aaron had been particularly
curious about what he'd seen.

17:33.920 --> 17:35.640
Why you hugging
that lady?

17:35.680 --> 17:37.840
Well, that's what
I'm trying to show you with Bozo.

17:37.840 --> 17:41.480
Sometimes it's a game that adults play
to show that they're friends.

17:41.520 --> 17:43.760
You say, "Hi,
I'm your friend."

17:43.760 --> 17:45.120
Aaron was skeptical.

17:45.160 --> 17:47.760
They returned to the playground
the following morning,

17:47.760 --> 17:50.480
but no one was there.

17:50.520 --> 17:53.040
Sarah hadn't shown up
at the town pool either,

17:53.080 --> 17:55.080
though Brad remembered telling
her that he and Aaron

17:55.120 --> 17:57.520
could be found there
most afternoons.

17:57.560 --> 18:00.520
It didn't seem to matter
that Sarah wasn't his type,

18:00.560 --> 18:04.480
wasn't even that pretty--
at least not compared to Kathy,

18:04.520 --> 18:08.920
who had long legs
and lustrous hair

18:08.960 --> 18:11.120
and perfect breasts.

18:11.120 --> 18:14.560
Sarah was short, boyish,

18:14.600 --> 18:17.400
and had eyebrows that were thicker
than Brad thought necessary.

18:19.120 --> 18:23.280
But even so, she'd walked
into his arms that day

18:23.280 --> 18:25.440
as if she were fulfilling
a secret wish

18:25.480 --> 18:29.160
he hadn't remembered
making.

18:29.200 --> 18:31.080
Hey, pervert!

18:31.120 --> 18:33.080
Yeah, you,
you pervert!

18:33.120 --> 18:35.560
You like little
boys, do you?

18:35.600 --> 18:38.080
- Larry?
- Yes, it's fucking Larry!

18:38.120 --> 18:39.840
Jesus, man, don't
even joke about that.

18:39.880 --> 18:41.600
What are you doing?
Are you busy?

18:41.640 --> 18:45.800
Uh, actually I'm
supposed to be studying.

18:45.840 --> 18:48.080
Taking the bar exam
next month.

18:48.120 --> 18:50.360
I thought you
did that last year.

18:50.400 --> 18:53.120
Yeah.
See how well I did?

18:53.160 --> 18:57.280
I got a better idea.
Get in.

18:57.320 --> 19:00.000
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on, come on, come on.

19:02.080 --> 19:04.880
Do you mind holding these?
Try to keep them nice.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.640
Oh, uh...

19:07.680 --> 19:11.640
are you, uh, part
of the committee?

19:13.080 --> 19:14.920
I am the committee.

19:16.520 --> 19:19.120
Wow.

19:19.120 --> 19:21.000
That's-- that's
quite a commitment.

19:21.040 --> 19:23.560
Yeah.

19:23.600 --> 19:25.760
Aren't you full time
on the force already?

19:27.960 --> 19:30.280
Yeah, I'm-- I'm taking
a little time off.

19:34.920 --> 19:38.400
You know what
they should do to this bastard?

19:38.440 --> 19:40.800
Just castrate him.
You know, pfft!

19:40.840 --> 19:44.360
Get it over with,
right?

19:44.400 --> 19:45.680
Yeah.

19:54.960 --> 19:56.280
You look good.

19:58.200 --> 20:01.280
You've been, uh,
working out?

20:01.320 --> 20:04.760
Uh, just push-ups,
crunches...

20:04.800 --> 20:06.320
a little light running.

20:08.920 --> 20:10.880
The guys are
gonna love this.

20:12.920 --> 20:14.280
What guys?

20:16.200 --> 20:19.440
Wow, this is something.

20:19.440 --> 20:22.320
Yeah, it's pretty,
but doesn't have a lot of give.

20:22.360 --> 20:23.760
It's like
playing on cement.

20:23.760 --> 20:25.600
Hey, hold on
a second.

20:25.640 --> 20:27.800
Duane, I've really gotta talk
to you about the committee.

20:27.840 --> 20:30.000
I mean, it would mean a lot to have
your support on this thing.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.160
I told you already, Larry, none of us
are gonna get involved in that shit.

20:33.200 --> 20:36.520
We're here to play ball. If that's your
thing, fine, but leave us out of it.

20:36.560 --> 20:38.680
Okay okay, fine.
I get it, I get it, I get it. Guys!

20:38.720 --> 20:41.640
Bring it in!

20:41.680 --> 20:44.520
Come on, come on,
hustle up!

20:44.560 --> 20:48.160
I want you all to meet
our new quarterback.

20:48.200 --> 20:51.040
- Quarterback?
- Guy better not be a pussy.

20:51.080 --> 20:52.520
He played in college.

20:52.560 --> 20:54.480
Uh, I'm a little
behind the curve.

20:54.520 --> 20:56.320
Who are you guys?

20:56.360 --> 20:58.120
- We're the Guardians!
- We're cops.

20:58.160 --> 21:00.000
Welcome to the Tri-County
touch football night league.

21:00.040 --> 21:02.800
Let's just work on some
simple pass patterns.

21:05.200 --> 21:07.800
Brad waited for his
good sense to kick in.

21:07.840 --> 21:10.800
There were lots of excuses
available to him.

21:10.840 --> 21:14.360
But it felt so good to be standing here
beneath the bright lights.

21:14.400 --> 21:16.800
And he was filled
with a feeling similar to the one

21:16.840 --> 21:18.920
he'd had right
before kissing Sarah,

21:18.960 --> 21:20.840
like his world had
cracked open

21:20.880 --> 21:24.120
to reveal a thrilling
new possibility.

21:25.440 --> 21:28.360
Okay, just let me
warm up a little.

21:28.400 --> 21:30.480
All right! Let's go!

21:30.520 --> 21:33.040
Set, hut!

21:38.360 --> 21:40.000
What the fuck?

21:40.040 --> 21:41.680
That's a late hit!

21:41.720 --> 21:43.600
This ain't
Pop Warner, ace.

21:45.680 --> 21:49.920
You fucking faggot.
You call yourself a quarterback?

22:01.520 --> 22:03.440
Oh, this isn't me.

22:06.000 --> 22:08.200
What are you doing?

22:08.240 --> 22:09.800
What is that?
What's that for?

22:11.600 --> 22:14.160
I want the scumbag
to know I'm keeping an eye on him.

22:19.480 --> 22:22.640
Oh, shit.
Oh, uh...

22:22.640 --> 22:25.520
I don't think we want
to be here, Larry.

22:25.560 --> 22:28.440
It's not a question
of want.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.120
Joanie thinks I'm
obsessed with this creep.

22:34.160 --> 22:36.320
She thinks if I had a job, I wouldn't
be driving past his house

22:36.360 --> 22:39.600
five, six times a day.
But you know what?

22:39.640 --> 22:42.760
I kinda think
this is my job.

22:45.160 --> 22:47.880
There's a roll of duct tape
in the glove compartment.

22:47.920 --> 22:51.200
Would you grab it for me?

22:58.400 --> 23:00.720
Honey?

23:03.280 --> 23:06.280
Hi!

23:06.320 --> 23:08.840
Where were you?

23:11.040 --> 23:12.760
Oh my God.
What happened?

23:12.800 --> 23:15.200
I-- I-- I joined
this group.

23:15.240 --> 23:17.320
The Committee
for Concerned Parents.

23:17.360 --> 23:20.200
We're distributing flyers about
that creep on Woodward Court.

23:20.240 --> 23:22.760
These guys play a little
touch football after.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.920
This late?

23:25.960 --> 23:28.760
Uh, it's a night league.

23:28.800 --> 23:32.320
So it's gonna be
a regular thing?

23:32.360 --> 23:34.000
No no no no,
just once a week,

23:34.040 --> 23:37.040
after I'm done
studying at the library.

23:37.080 --> 23:38.760
Is that okay?

23:38.800 --> 23:41.600
Uh, who are the guys?

23:41.640 --> 23:43.640
You remember
Larry Hedges?

23:43.680 --> 23:45.600
The guy from the Sprinkler
Park with the twins?

23:45.640 --> 23:48.720
It's his organization.

23:48.760 --> 23:50.760
I thought you
didn't like him.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.440
He's okay.

23:54.480 --> 23:57.600
This committee makes a
lot of sense. I mean it's--

23:57.640 --> 23:59.760
it's pretty scary having
a weirdo like that

23:59.800 --> 24:01.960
living right
by the playground.

24:04.040 --> 24:07.120
Mmm.
I know.

24:07.120 --> 24:09.000
I hate to even
think about it.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.320
Guess you'd better
take a shower.

24:14.360 --> 24:17.160
Brad showered quickly,
sensing a rare opportunity

24:17.200 --> 24:20.160
to have sex with his wife.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.240
"This is just what I need,"
he thought.

24:22.280 --> 24:25.320
"Something to take
my mind off that kiss."

24:25.360 --> 24:27.400
Please don't.

24:27.440 --> 24:29.120
Come on, Kathy, we've
been through this before.

24:29.160 --> 24:30.680
He needs to start
sleeping by himself.

24:30.720 --> 24:32.520
I know.
He looks so comfy.

24:32.560 --> 24:34.200
Well, he'll be just
as comfy in his own bed.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.560
I just miss
him so much.

24:36.560 --> 24:39.560
I'm getting a little tired waking up
with his foot in my face.

24:39.600 --> 24:42.120
It's a perfect foot.

24:42.160 --> 24:44.760
Look at him.
Just look at him.

24:46.040 --> 24:47.440
He's a handsome devil.

24:47.440 --> 24:50.760
Mmm, he's perfect.

25:03.760 --> 25:05.280
Good night.

25:09.800 --> 25:11.360
Number 2 Hillcrest

25:11.400 --> 25:13.440
was an impressive
piece of real estate.

25:13.480 --> 25:15.560
Even so,
Sarah was ambivalent

25:15.600 --> 25:17.760
about the house
she occupied.

25:17.800 --> 25:20.840
She wasn't involved
with its purchase or design.

25:20.880 --> 25:23.720
The place was a hand-me-down of sorts
from Richard's mother.

25:23.760 --> 25:27.200
And the furnishings
were leftovers from his first marriage.

25:27.240 --> 25:29.080
By the time
Sarah arrived here

25:29.120 --> 25:31.560
Richard wasn't all that
interested in redecorating.

25:31.600 --> 25:34.560
And so she decided
to leave it as it was,

25:34.600 --> 25:38.320
with the exception of a single room
that she staked out for her own

25:38.320 --> 25:40.240
and gradually began
to populate it

25:40.240 --> 25:42.400
with the remnants
of her former self.

25:48.000 --> 25:49.880
From the moment
Lucy was born

25:49.920 --> 25:52.760
Sarah had refused to hire
someone for child care.

25:52.800 --> 25:55.080
Read me a story?

25:55.120 --> 25:57.760
In a minute,
okay?

25:57.800 --> 26:00.280
- Can I sit on your lap?
- I said in a minute!

26:00.320 --> 26:02.400
Go finish your
program, go.

26:02.440 --> 26:05.320
She wasn't exactly sure
why she had taken this stance.

26:05.360 --> 26:08.520
The truth was she spent
most afternoons marking time,

26:08.560 --> 26:12.120
waiting desperately for the moment
when her husband returned from work

26:12.160 --> 26:14.840
and she could finally
have a moment to herself.

26:14.880 --> 26:16.960
But even this was not
something she could rely on.

26:17.000 --> 26:18.480
You're ready to roll?

26:18.520 --> 26:20.400
Could you wait
a few minutes?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.760
I'm sorry, Richard's barricaded
in the upstairs office

26:22.800 --> 26:25.560
- finishing some stuff for work.
- No problem.

26:25.600 --> 26:27.640
I've got a little surprise
for someone anyway.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.000
She's a terror at night.
I couldn't get her to nap again.

26:30.000 --> 26:32.960
- Oh, the poor thing.
- Poor mom is more like it.

26:33.000 --> 26:34.960
Hello.

26:35.000 --> 26:37.840
Is there a cute little
girl in the house?

26:37.840 --> 26:40.360
Oh, my goodness!

26:40.400 --> 26:43.080
What--

26:43.120 --> 26:45.440
what have I found?

26:45.480 --> 26:48.000
- A beanie.
- Oh, a beanie.

26:48.040 --> 26:49.480
Jean, you didn't
need to to that.

26:49.520 --> 26:53.200
Oh, this little dog needed
a girl to take care of him.

26:53.240 --> 26:55.920
And I know a little girl
who needed a dog.

26:57.960 --> 26:59.840
Let me see.

26:59.880 --> 27:01.520
Sarah was beginning
to get angry.

27:01.560 --> 27:04.040
Her evening fitness walk
was the one thing

27:04.080 --> 27:07.160
she looked forward to all day,
and Richard knew this.

27:09.880 --> 27:12.040
But if there was one thing
life had taught Richard,

27:12.080 --> 27:13.920
it was that it was
ridiculous

27:13.960 --> 27:16.960
to be at war
with your own desires.

27:17.000 --> 27:20.440
He could easily imagine what people
would say if they could see him now--

27:20.480 --> 27:23.280
Exactly the same thing they'd
say if someone had told them

27:23.280 --> 27:26.720
that Ray from next door
was a transvestite,

27:26.760 --> 27:28.480
or that Ted from work

27:28.520 --> 27:31.080
had anonymous gay sex
at highway rest stops.

27:31.120 --> 27:34.320
"But we want what we want,"
Richard thought,

27:34.320 --> 27:36.320
"and there's not much
we can do about it."

27:37.960 --> 27:40.640
He had stumbled
on the site 11 months ago

27:40.680 --> 27:43.480
while doing research
for a consulting firm.

27:43.520 --> 27:46.080
His office door
was wide open.

27:46.120 --> 27:48.120
But he clicked
on the link anyway.

27:55.920 --> 27:58.000
He was deeply engrossed
in his discovery

27:58.040 --> 28:00.480
when Ted knocked
on his door.

28:00.520 --> 28:02.240
I'm taking lunch orders.
You want something?

28:02.280 --> 28:04.160
Casually, but with great haste

28:04.200 --> 28:07.080
Richard banished Slutty Kay
from his screen...

28:07.120 --> 28:09.240
Uh, yeah, I'll have
a chicken Caesar.

28:09.280 --> 28:12.560
...and reentered the flow
of an ordinary day.

28:14.840 --> 28:17.200
It wasn't until
several months later

28:17.240 --> 28:20.480
that Richard gave the slightest thought
to the site he had stumbled upon.

28:23.120 --> 28:24.880
Do you need me
for anything else?

28:24.920 --> 28:26.800
Uh, no no, you
can head home.

28:26.840 --> 28:28.440
I'm just gonna catch up
on some e-mail.

28:28.480 --> 28:31.400
Well, don't stay too late.
Your dinner will get cold.

28:39.240 --> 28:43.280
Lately Slutty Kay
had become a problem.

28:43.280 --> 28:45.240
He thought about her
far too often,

28:45.280 --> 28:46.560
and spent hours studying

28:46.600 --> 28:49.560
the thousands of photographs
available to him.

28:49.600 --> 28:52.360
Some of Kay's practices
struck him as bizarre,

28:52.400 --> 28:54.240
even off-putting.

28:54.280 --> 28:57.640
She had a thing
about kitchen utensils,

28:57.680 --> 28:59.920
spatulas, and dressing up
like a little girl

28:59.920 --> 29:01.560
and playing with balloons.

29:01.600 --> 29:04.400
But who was
Richard to judge?

29:07.520 --> 29:09.480
Oh, that's it.

29:09.520 --> 29:13.120
Though as close as Richard
sometimes felt to Slutty Kay,

29:13.160 --> 29:15.320
as much as he believed
that he knew her,

29:15.360 --> 29:17.960
he could never get past
the uncomfortable fact

29:18.000 --> 29:22.000
that she existed for him
solely as a digital image.

29:31.600 --> 29:34.000
The panties were an attempt
to solve this problem.

29:34.000 --> 29:37.880
Maybe a sniff or two
would hurry things along,

29:37.920 --> 29:40.400
so he could get back
downstairs to his real life,

29:40.440 --> 29:42.360
where his wife
was waiting for him

29:42.400 --> 29:45.480
her impatience increasing
by the minute.

29:45.520 --> 29:48.360
What are you doing?

30:39.040 --> 30:42.880
Are you almost finished there? 'Cause
I'd really like to go for my walk?

30:44.520 --> 30:47.720
- You could have knocked.
- I did!

30:49.160 --> 30:51.800
We need to talk.

31:02.160 --> 31:04.040
You're awfully quiet
this evening.

31:04.080 --> 31:07.240
- Everything okay?
- What?

31:07.280 --> 31:09.480
Yeah.

31:09.520 --> 31:11.560
You'll have to walk
without me tomorrow night.

31:11.600 --> 31:13.960
I've got a book
group meeting.

31:14.000 --> 31:15.920
Okay.

31:15.960 --> 31:18.160
You're sure everything's
all right?

31:19.160 --> 31:21.840
Yeah, sorry.

31:21.880 --> 31:25.200
I guess I'm just
a little tired.

31:25.240 --> 31:26.920
So what are
you reading?

31:26.960 --> 31:28.720
"Crime and
Punishment."

31:28.720 --> 31:31.840
Wow. That's pretty
highbrow for a book group.

31:31.880 --> 31:35.440
Well, we have some
very stimulating discussions.

31:35.480 --> 31:37.960
You should come next month.
We're doing "Madame Bovary."

31:38.000 --> 31:40.040
You could be
my little sister.

31:40.080 --> 31:41.600
Little sister?

31:41.640 --> 31:45.160
We're trying to get younger
women involved.

31:45.200 --> 31:46.960
We call them
our little sisters.

31:48.400 --> 31:50.720
I don't know, Jean.

31:50.760 --> 31:53.240
I read "Madame Bovary"
in grad school.

31:53.280 --> 31:55.680
It's a pretty
misogynist text.

31:55.720 --> 31:58.720
Well, that's an
interesting perspective.

31:58.760 --> 32:01.440
- You should come.
- Let me think about it.

32:01.480 --> 32:04.360
Oh, would you
excuse me, Jean?

32:04.400 --> 32:07.680
Someone's at my door.
I'll call you, okay?

32:07.720 --> 32:09.520
Hi!

32:12.800 --> 32:14.320
Hi!

32:17.640 --> 32:20.200
Wow, God,

32:20.240 --> 32:21.680
this is a surprise.

32:21.680 --> 32:23.640
I haven't seen
you since--

32:23.680 --> 32:26.120
I-- I hope you don't mind. Your husband
said you'd be back any minute.

32:26.160 --> 32:27.720
Oh, no,
not at all.

32:27.760 --> 32:30.000
It's good
to see you.

32:30.000 --> 32:33.680
God, um, can I get you
some tea or something?

32:33.680 --> 32:36.040
I can only stay a minute.
I just came to warn you.

32:36.080 --> 32:38.600
- You know that guy, the pervert?
- Uh-huh.

32:38.640 --> 32:40.160
He's been riding his
bike near the playground

32:40.200 --> 32:42.600
- checking out the kids.
- Oh, God.

32:42.640 --> 32:45.200
Oh, God,
do the police know?

32:45.240 --> 32:47.160
Nothing they can do.
He's not breaking any laws.

32:47.200 --> 32:50.440
I guess they're just waiting
for him to kill someone.

32:50.480 --> 32:52.640
I just thought
you should know.

32:52.680 --> 32:56.120
Thanks, that's
nice of you.

32:56.160 --> 32:58.360
Let me get
you some tea.

32:58.400 --> 33:01.960
I'm sorry.
I-- I don't think it's a good idea.

33:04.400 --> 33:06.640
I didn't mean
to kiss him.

33:06.640 --> 33:09.760
I don't even know
how it happened.

33:13.200 --> 33:16.080
I'd better go.
Mike's gonna worry.

33:21.400 --> 33:23.720
You wanna talk?

33:23.760 --> 33:25.520
I'm tired.

34:55.360 --> 34:57.680
Hello.

34:57.720 --> 35:00.040
Hey.

35:00.080 --> 35:03.560
No, he's still
sleeping.

35:03.600 --> 35:06.680
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm going
through it right now.

35:09.800 --> 35:13.160
No, I guess I
don't need them.

35:16.360 --> 35:17.640
Okay.

35:19.000 --> 35:22.160
All right, bye.

36:23.520 --> 36:24.840
H-hi.

36:24.880 --> 36:27.080
H-hello?

36:27.120 --> 36:30.240
Yes, I'd like
to place an order.

36:30.280 --> 36:33.480
Pierce, Sarah,
Mrs.

36:35.440 --> 36:36.520
Um...

36:36.560 --> 36:40.680
it's the red bathing suit
on page 29.

36:40.720 --> 36:42.880
The hide-your-tummy
halter neck.

36:44.840 --> 36:47.320
Uh, I'm size...

36:49.680 --> 36:53.320
10, eight?
I mean, I think.

36:53.360 --> 36:55.360
E-eight.

37:35.640 --> 37:37.280
You want to go
in the pool?

37:37.320 --> 37:38.880
You do?

37:41.840 --> 37:45.080
One, two.

37:50.720 --> 37:53.600
Daddy, can I go
in the pool now?

37:53.640 --> 37:55.480
In a minute, okay?

37:55.520 --> 37:58.560
Okay.

37:58.600 --> 38:01.360
There you go.

38:08.360 --> 38:10.800
Mommy, I have
to go pee-pee.

38:10.840 --> 38:13.040
Just go in the pool.

38:13.080 --> 38:16.360
Huh-uh, I want
to go to the bathroom.

38:16.400 --> 38:18.240
Really?

38:18.280 --> 38:20.080
Okay, come on.

38:24.560 --> 38:26.120
Okay, ready?

38:26.160 --> 38:28.200
There.

38:55.960 --> 38:58.000
Swing down.

39:00.880 --> 39:03.760
Hey, I'm drumming it.

39:03.800 --> 39:05.000
Oh.

39:05.960 --> 39:08.800
Wow.

39:08.840 --> 39:11.280
- It's you.
- Yeah, hey.

39:11.320 --> 39:13.960
- Hi!
- Okay.

39:15.320 --> 39:17.680
I hope you don't mind.
Lucy has sensitive skin.

39:17.720 --> 39:20.280
She's better off
in the shade.

39:20.320 --> 39:22.920
Oh no,
not at all.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.160
It's nice
to see you again.

39:24.200 --> 39:26.120
Yeah, you too.

39:28.640 --> 39:30.960
I'm sorry,
would you get my back?

39:31.000 --> 39:34.000
Um...
okay, sure.

39:34.040 --> 39:35.360
Thanks.

39:35.400 --> 39:36.880
Right.

39:36.920 --> 39:39.840
# Who is knocking
on the door? #

39:39.880 --> 39:41.320
- Thanks a lot.
- # Knocking on the door #

39:41.360 --> 39:43.400
# Knocking on the door #

39:43.440 --> 39:46.040
- # Who is knocking on the door? #
- It's okay, just...

39:46.080 --> 39:48.440
# A way, hey hey. #

39:48.480 --> 39:50.520
Lucy, say hi to the little boy
from the playground.

39:50.560 --> 39:54.280
Hi.

39:54.320 --> 39:56.480
You remember him?

40:01.520 --> 40:03.440
The pool became a ritual.

40:03.480 --> 40:06.080
I was trying to think.
I just didn't know the way.

40:06.120 --> 40:07.840
- Oh oh, okay.
- I'm here, I'm here.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.480
We have the creature
and we have flower.

40:09.520 --> 40:10.680
Right.

40:10.720 --> 40:13.120
Day after day they sat
together in the shade

40:13.160 --> 40:15.080
getting to know
each other.

40:16.120 --> 40:18.840
This needs mustard.

40:18.880 --> 40:21.040
- Mustard?
- Yeah.

40:21.080 --> 40:22.920
Having little choice
in the matter,

40:22.960 --> 40:24.720
Aaron and Lucy formed
a fragile friendship.

40:30.720 --> 40:32.640
Aw, that's perfect.

40:32.680 --> 40:35.480
Sometimes Brad and Sarah
traded offspring.

40:39.400 --> 40:41.440
Mama said, "What Papa
told you was right.

40:41.480 --> 40:44.400
It's not a good idea
to talk to strangers."

40:44.440 --> 40:48.240
It was the most fun
Sarah had had in years.

41:01.240 --> 41:04.160
But there was always
that longing to touch,

41:04.200 --> 41:07.560
to be touched by Brad.

41:07.600 --> 41:11.000
And, as badly as
she wanted this,

41:11.040 --> 41:14.360
she wanted just as badly
to hold on to the innocent public life

41:14.400 --> 41:16.840
they'd made for themselves
out in the open.

41:16.880 --> 41:19.400
So she accepted
the trade--

41:19.440 --> 41:22.400
the melancholy
handshake at 4:00

41:22.440 --> 41:25.400
in exchange for this
little patch of grass,

41:25.440 --> 41:27.960
some sunscreen
and companionship.

41:28.000 --> 41:31.360
One more happy day
at the pool.

41:33.000 --> 41:35.600
Okay, no pasta
for dinner, okay?

41:35.640 --> 41:37.920
We eat way too much
pasta around here.

41:37.960 --> 41:39.880
I thought you
liked my pasta.

41:39.920 --> 41:42.400
No, I do.
That's the problem.

41:42.440 --> 41:45.280
Pretty soon I can sell advertising
space on my ass.

41:46.480 --> 41:47.920
No, that's okay.
I've got to go.

41:47.960 --> 41:49.840
I've got
a 9:00 at Taps.

41:49.880 --> 41:51.880
I thought you were
already editing.

41:51.920 --> 41:54.680
Yeah, so did I.
It was just--

41:54.720 --> 41:58.120
there's something in this
family's story that really got to me.

42:00.680 --> 42:02.800
The father was...

42:02.840 --> 42:05.680
K-I-L-L-E-D

42:05.680 --> 42:08.960
in a, um,
mortar attack,

42:09.000 --> 42:11.760
and, um, left behind
a little boy.

42:14.280 --> 42:16.680
I was talking to the mother the other
day on the phone,

42:16.720 --> 42:20.320
and she was saying she didn't know what
she was going to do next Christmas.

42:20.360 --> 42:21.600
Jeez, I bet.

42:21.640 --> 42:24.040
No, it wasn't like that.
It was more...

42:24.080 --> 42:26.960
she was wondering, should she keep
this tradition with her son

42:26.960 --> 42:28.600
that began with
the boy's father.

42:28.640 --> 42:31.320
And she was saying
he had this knack

42:31.360 --> 42:33.960
for requesting
odd Christmas gifts--

42:34.000 --> 42:35.880
scuba gear one year

42:35.920 --> 42:38.440
and rappelling gear
the next.

42:38.480 --> 42:42.280
She said he wasn't
afraid to try anything.

42:42.320 --> 42:44.840
Trying new things
made him feel...

42:44.880 --> 42:47.760
more alive.

42:49.680 --> 42:52.840
I've got to go.
See you later.

43:01.360 --> 43:04.360
Patch one of your best
and then we'll patch both of them.

43:04.400 --> 43:06.240
Okay?

43:08.880 --> 43:11.200
Hey, I got something.

43:15.400 --> 43:17.800
Hot enough for you?

43:17.840 --> 43:20.360
Yeah.

43:20.400 --> 43:23.360
Yeah, it's so humid.

43:23.400 --> 43:26.760
I've got football
practice tonight.

43:26.800 --> 43:28.680
Be like playing
in a sauna.

43:28.720 --> 43:31.920
Watch out for
that Italian guy.

43:31.920 --> 43:34.440
What's his name?

43:34.480 --> 43:35.800
Corrente?

43:35.840 --> 43:38.440
Yeah.

43:38.480 --> 43:40.840
Remember what
happened to your knee last week?

43:40.880 --> 43:43.240
You should be
careful, Brad.

43:45.920 --> 43:47.560
I'll be careful.

43:47.600 --> 43:50.120
Promise?

43:52.360 --> 43:55.960
Yeah.
Yeah, I promise.

43:58.960 --> 44:01.360
Weatherman said
scattered showers.

44:01.360 --> 44:03.280
I don't see
scattered showers.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.720
Mom, could I please
have some money for a snack?

44:15.760 --> 44:18.240
No, sweetheart.
You guys just had a snack. No.

44:18.280 --> 44:19.680
Oh, okay.

44:19.720 --> 44:21.600
All they want is sugar.

44:21.640 --> 44:23.360
Constantly.

45:38.040 --> 45:39.960
Oh, no.

45:46.800 --> 45:49.280
It's him.

45:50.360 --> 45:52.280
Oh, Jesus.

45:59.480 --> 46:01.480
Oh my God,
it's him.

46:01.520 --> 46:04.040
He's in the pool.

46:04.080 --> 46:06.120
Oh my God!

46:06.160 --> 46:08.200
Jacob, get out
of the pool now!

46:08.240 --> 46:10.160
Oh my God.
That's him.

46:10.200 --> 46:14.000
- Get away from that man.
- Why is everybody running to the pool?

46:14.040 --> 46:15.960
Brooke?
Jake?

46:16.000 --> 46:18.600
Dale, you'd better
get over here.

46:22.560 --> 46:23.920
Get out of the pool!

46:33.360 --> 46:36.080
Where's your sister?

46:44.440 --> 46:47.960
Why'd we have to get out, Mom?

46:48.000 --> 46:50.680
I'm scared.

46:55.800 --> 46:58.760
- What did he do?
- What's going on?

47:13.680 --> 47:16.240
I'm scared.

47:21.440 --> 47:24.080
Um, why the
police is here?

47:24.120 --> 47:27.720
Um, there's a man over there who
doesn't have a ticket to get in,

47:28.040 --> 47:29.640
so they're asking
him to go home.

47:29.680 --> 47:31.640
Mr. McGorvey.
Mr. McGorvey.

47:31.680 --> 47:33.480
It'd be wise for you to get
out of the pool at this time.

47:41.320 --> 47:43.320
Did that man
go near you?

47:43.360 --> 47:45.960
You're sure he
didn't touch you?

47:50.080 --> 47:52.360
Step out of
the pool, sir.

48:10.800 --> 48:13.800
I was only trying
to cool off.

48:13.840 --> 48:17.160
All right,
let's go.

48:21.520 --> 48:24.400
You can go back in the pool.

48:56.120 --> 48:59.560
Bear with us, please. You
know what that sounds means.

48:59.600 --> 49:02.880
Let's go. Out of the pool.
We're closing her up. Let's go.

49:02.960 --> 49:05.800
Exit the pool and vacate
the grounds immediately.

49:05.840 --> 49:07.760
Okay, I'll see
you tomorrow.

49:07.760 --> 49:10.200
You're going to carry her?
Come on, put her in the stroller.

49:10.240 --> 49:11.400
No, she won't do the stroller.

49:11.440 --> 49:12.680
- Really?
- No, she will not do this.

49:12.720 --> 49:13.960
Lucy, would you like to go
in the stroller?

49:14.000 --> 49:16.560
Can I interest you in a stroller?
It appears she'd like a stroller.

49:18.000 --> 49:19.880
It's out of
your way.

49:19.920 --> 49:23.000
No, it's fine.
You don't mind, do you, Aaron?

49:23.040 --> 49:25.320
Run!

49:35.280 --> 49:37.880
You'd better come inside.
You can't walk home in this.

49:40.160 --> 49:41.760
Oh!

49:49.840 --> 49:53.240
- You can put him down in Lucy's room.
- Okay.

49:57.800 --> 49:59.680
This is amazing.

49:59.720 --> 50:02.280
She never naps.

50:02.320 --> 50:04.520
Well, he'll be
out for the next two hours.

50:04.560 --> 50:07.080
We'll have to get him out
of that nightgown, though,

50:07.120 --> 50:09.160
before he wakes up
or he'll never forgive me.

50:19.040 --> 50:20.920
Nice place.

50:20.960 --> 50:22.600
- You think so?
- Yeah.

50:22.640 --> 50:24.440
Well, Richard does
all right for himself.

50:24.480 --> 50:26.400
What's he do, again?

50:26.480 --> 50:29.920
Lies. Um, please have a seat.
Make yourself comfortable.

50:29.960 --> 50:31.560
Better not,
I might ruin your furniture.

50:31.600 --> 50:34.360
I'll put these things in the dryer
and get us some towels.

50:34.400 --> 50:36.040
Okay.

52:34.680 --> 52:37.560
Oh, God!

52:39.440 --> 52:41.720
Oh, God!

52:46.160 --> 52:48.480
Do you feel bad
about this?

52:48.520 --> 52:50.920
No, I don't.

52:50.960 --> 52:52.800
I do.

52:52.840 --> 52:55.480
I feel really bad.

52:55.520 --> 52:57.040
Okay.

53:30.760 --> 53:33.600
Son?

53:37.000 --> 53:39.000
Son?

53:42.160 --> 53:44.560
Be well.

53:49.400 --> 53:51.080
May knew it wasn't natural

53:51.120 --> 53:52.920
for a grown man
to be living with his mother.

53:52.960 --> 53:54.880
No hobbies,
no diversions.

53:54.920 --> 53:57.720
It was like he was
still in prison.

53:57.760 --> 53:59.640
What he needed
was a girlfriend,

53:59.680 --> 54:02.280
and May intended to
help him find one.

54:02.320 --> 54:05.400
There are four whole columns
of lonely women here,

54:05.440 --> 54:07.840
and only a handful of men.
The odds are on our side.

54:07.880 --> 54:10.240
Why wouldn't one of
these women want

54:10.280 --> 54:12.840
to meet a nice
person like you?

54:12.880 --> 54:15.240
I'm not
a nice person.

54:15.280 --> 54:17.640
You did a bad thing.

54:17.680 --> 54:19.920
But that doesn't mean
you're a bad person.

54:19.960 --> 54:22.240
I have a psychosexual
disorder.

54:22.280 --> 54:23.680
You're better now.

54:23.720 --> 54:25.600
They wouldn't have let
you out if you weren't.

54:25.640 --> 54:27.880
They let me out
because they had to.

54:27.920 --> 54:30.400
Well, maybe
if you found

54:30.440 --> 54:32.640
a girlfriend closer
to your own age

54:32.680 --> 54:35.400
you wouldn't have
the bad urges so often.

54:35.440 --> 54:37.960
I don't want a girlfriend
my own age, Mommy.

54:38.000 --> 54:40.520
I wish I did.

54:43.320 --> 54:45.280
What are you going
to do when I'm gone?

54:45.360 --> 54:47.720
Who's going to
take care of you?

54:50.800 --> 54:52.720
What's the matter,
Mommy?

54:55.600 --> 54:57.520
Are you sick
or something?

54:57.520 --> 54:59.920
I'm an old woman.
I'm not going to live forever,

54:59.920 --> 55:01.960
Who's going to cook
for you?

55:02.000 --> 55:03.640
Who's going
to wash the dishes?

55:03.680 --> 55:06.080
I can wash
the dishes,

55:06.160 --> 55:07.960
You've never washed
a dish in your life.

55:08.000 --> 55:10.600
I could do it if I had to.
I'm not a retard.

55:10.640 --> 55:13.080
No, you're not.

55:14.560 --> 55:17.080
You're a miracle,
Ronnie.

55:18.840 --> 55:21.640
We're all miracles.

55:21.680 --> 55:24.320
You know why?

55:24.360 --> 55:26.440
Because as humans,

55:26.480 --> 55:30.240
everyday we go
about our business,

55:30.280 --> 55:32.800
and all that time

55:32.840 --> 55:35.680
we know, we all know

55:35.720 --> 55:38.840
that the things
we love,

55:38.880 --> 55:42.400
the people we love...

55:44.400 --> 55:47.960
at any time, it can
all be taken away.

55:51.760 --> 55:54.560
We live knowing that

55:54.600 --> 55:57.520
and we keep
going anyway.

56:02.800 --> 56:05.200
Animals don't do that.

56:09.480 --> 56:12.480
Now I'm not asking you
to get married, Ronnie.

56:14.160 --> 56:17.360
I'm just saying put an ad in the paper,
see what happens.

56:17.400 --> 56:20.680
Fine. I'll do it if
it will make you happy.

56:20.720 --> 56:23.080
But just one date.
All right?

56:26.160 --> 56:28.960
You have a nice smile,
why don't we start with that?

56:29.000 --> 56:32.080
What else?

56:34.320 --> 56:37.280
You always eat what I put in front
of you. You never complain.

56:37.320 --> 56:40.040
What else?

56:40.080 --> 56:41.800
You're trying to
get back in shape.

56:41.840 --> 56:43.560
You exercise.

56:54.280 --> 56:56.160
Wait right there,
young man.

56:56.200 --> 56:58.480
If you're going out
for some exercise,

56:58.520 --> 57:01.120
you can post this now.

57:03.760 --> 57:06.160
Hmm.

57:36.880 --> 57:38.800
Mmm.

57:41.520 --> 57:43.800
Come on.

57:43.840 --> 57:45.400
Let's do it again.

57:47.920 --> 57:50.120
All right.

57:51.240 --> 57:53.800
God, it's hot
as hell up here.

57:53.840 --> 57:55.960
What's wrong with
the laundry room?

57:56.000 --> 57:59.040
No mattress.

57:59.080 --> 58:02.160
Come on.
Lie down.

58:16.400 --> 58:18.320
You're nervous,
aren't you?

58:18.320 --> 58:20.120
What?
What do you mean?

58:20.160 --> 58:21.960
The game.

58:22.000 --> 58:26.320
Don't worry.
You'll be great tonight.

58:27.760 --> 58:30.800
I don't know.
I haven't played in 10 years.

58:32.760 --> 58:35.400
It used to be
my whole life.

58:35.440 --> 58:38.120
Then when I stopped,
I just...

58:38.160 --> 58:41.280
stopped. I didn't
even miss it.

58:42.840 --> 58:45.200
Now that I'm playing
again, I...

58:45.240 --> 58:47.880
feel I--

58:49.640 --> 58:52.120
I don't know.

58:52.160 --> 58:54.080
You feel alive.

58:54.120 --> 58:55.480
Yeah.

58:55.520 --> 58:58.040
That's good.

58:58.080 --> 58:59.960
That's how you're
supposed to feel.

59:01.120 --> 59:03.400
You're right.

59:03.440 --> 59:06.600
I guess it's just
been awhile.

59:08.000 --> 59:10.360
Yeah.

59:54.960 --> 59:56.880
Shake.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:19.560
- Call it.
- Heads.

01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:23.160
Heads it is.

01:00:25.720 --> 01:00:27.800
Ready?

01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:38.800
- Hello?
- Hi, Mom. Did I wake you?

01:00:38.840 --> 01:00:40.680
Oh, no honey.
Is everything okay?

01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:42.440
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:42.480 --> 01:00:44.000
You don't
sound fine.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.400
No, there's nothing wrong.
I just wanted to say hi.

01:00:46.480 --> 01:00:48.760
Well, hi.

01:00:48.800 --> 01:00:50.200
Hi.

01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:51.640
So how's my
little guy?

01:00:51.680 --> 01:00:53.880
He's great.
He's sleeping right here next to me.

01:00:53.920 --> 01:00:55.520
He's such
a cutie.

01:00:55.560 --> 01:00:57.440
So where's Brad?

01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.560
Brad's out.

01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.200
Oh, I'm surprised
the library stays open this late.

01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:03.880
Well, he's not
at the library.

01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:05.440
He's playing football
with some buddies.

01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:08.200
Oh, honey. Do you remember when
your father took up golf?

01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:10.760
He's not
like dad.

01:01:10.800 --> 01:01:13.160
Honey, they're
all the same.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:15.320
Well, he's not.

01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.280
You work so hard.

01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:20.520
Now listen...

01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:22.960
I could keep an eye
on the boys when you're at work;

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:24.440
make sure they're
staying out of trouble.

01:01:24.480 --> 01:01:26.760
- Do you want me to come up for a visit?
- No no, Mom, don't come.

01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:28.200
Well, honey, I worry
about you kids.

01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:30.480
Now what are you going to do if he
fails the test again?

01:01:30.520 --> 01:01:31.920
He's not going
to fail the test.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.680
Oh, honey,
that's what you said last time.

01:01:33.720 --> 01:01:35.400
Now how are you
doing for money?

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:37.880
We're fine.

01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:41.000
I'm going to send you a little
extra this month.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:42.600
- Mom...
- Honey, it's no burden.

01:01:42.640 --> 01:01:45.800
- Mom... Mom, please.
- I'm happy to help.

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:53.320
Aw, shit.

01:01:59.040 --> 01:02:01.280
Although the Guardians
lost by 26 points,

01:02:01.320 --> 01:02:04.160
Brad felt oddly exhilarated in the bar
after the game.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:09.080
He could feel a new respect
in the way the cops looked at him.

01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:12.160
- What you drinking, buddy?
- He wasn't on probation anymore.

01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:13.360
He was a member
of the team.

01:02:13.400 --> 01:02:15.040
Ice and Advil.

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:17.320
If all else fails, you can always see
the team physician,

01:02:17.360 --> 01:02:19.600
Dr. Daniels.
All his friends call him Jack.

01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.800
- To the good doctor.
- Hear, hear.

01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:27.640
- Larry? Here, you go Larry.
- Oh, thanks.

01:02:27.680 --> 01:02:29.680
Let me just
grab a chair.

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:39.120
Oh, we just gave you a shot.
We just gave you a shot.

01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:49.840
I had no business being
on that field tonight.

01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:52.080
I let you down.

01:02:52.120 --> 01:02:53.600
I let the whole
team down.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:55.400
I'm slow and
I'm fat.

01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:57.280
I let that guy
piss all over me.

01:02:57.320 --> 01:02:59.880
Come on. That guy was offsides
the whole night.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.880
Joanie left me.

01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.800
Took the kids and went
to her mother's.

01:03:10.440 --> 01:03:12.560
Jesus, Larry,
that's a tough break.

01:03:12.600 --> 01:03:14.400
Oh, I deserved it.

01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:16.360
Me and my big mouth.

01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.440
I called her
a fucking whore,

01:03:18.480 --> 01:03:20.400
right in front
of the kids.

01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:24.480
Why did you do that?

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.400
Huh,
I don't know.

01:03:26.480 --> 01:03:30.120
I was in a bad mood
or something.

01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:32.040
Now I'm fucked.

01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.040
Hey, did you hear
about the pervert?

01:03:41.080 --> 01:03:43.000
He went swimming
at the town pool.

01:03:43.040 --> 01:03:44.440
- What?
- Yeah.

01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:47.000
- Who told you that?
- Nobody. I saw it myself.

01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:49.080
- The town pool?
- Yeah, during the heatwave.

01:03:49.120 --> 01:03:50.560
- The town pool?
- Yep.

01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:52.360
Th-that place is
crawling with kids.

01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:53.960
I mean, my boys
go there.

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:56.360
Yeah, well, you know what,
it was just that one time.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.640
Um, he-- he won't be back.
The cops came.

01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.480
Cops? What cops?
Anyone from the team?

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.000
Uh, no.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.280
You sure?

01:04:05.320 --> 01:04:07.640
- Anyone from the team show up there?
- No no.

01:04:07.680 --> 01:04:09.280
- Yes or no!
- I'm saying no.

01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.480
- No, nobody...
- Jesus Christ,

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.560
that little fucking weasel.

01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.960
Larry, slow down.

01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:16.240
Slow down, Larry!

01:04:23.400 --> 01:04:25.480
- What now?
- Good evening, Mrs. McGorvey.

01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:26.560
We were wondering
if Ronnie was home.

01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:27.800
You leave him alone.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.480
We just want a little
moment of his time. Just a little chat.

01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.320
This is my house.
I pay the mortgage,

01:04:31.360 --> 01:04:33.160
and I say who is
and isn't--

01:04:33.200 --> 01:04:34.760
Yoo-hoo, Ronnie!

01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:37.560
- Get your perverted ass down here now.
- I'm calling the police.

01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.760
I hear they're well-disposed
to child molesters.

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:41.400
It's okay, Mommy.
Can I help you, gentlemen?

01:04:41.440 --> 01:04:42.960
Ronnie, you go
on upstairs.

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.440
Larry, let him go. I think he gets
the point. We can go home now.

01:04:45.480 --> 01:04:47.360
You listen to me, you
little piece of shit.

01:04:47.400 --> 01:04:49.480
You stay the fuck away
from the town pool.

01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.440
- You hear me?
- You're a bully!

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.640
My Ronnie would
never do what he did.

01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:07.640
That poor child
at the mall--

01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:12.040
what you did to him.

01:05:27.600 --> 01:05:29.720
Larry?

01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.960
Larry?

01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:38.200
Why did she
say that?

01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:40.760
Oh, don't pretend you
don't know about me.

01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:42.200
Everybody knows.
Everybody!

01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.280
Look, h-honestly,
I-- I don't know anything.

01:05:45.320 --> 01:05:47.920
I remember hearing
something...

01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:51.680
a few years ago
when we first moved here, but--

01:05:51.720 --> 01:05:53.600
something about
a-- a shooting

01:05:53.640 --> 01:05:55.720
at the mall.

01:05:55.760 --> 01:05:59.240
That's-- that's it.
That's all.

01:05:59.280 --> 01:06:01.480
I didn't even
know you then.

01:06:05.840 --> 01:06:07.800
I'm sorry.

01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:11.880
Sorry.

01:06:12.880 --> 01:06:14.920
It's okay.

01:06:20.640 --> 01:06:24.120
Dispatch said there
was a shooter loose at the mall.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.280
It was 10 minutes
from the end of my shift.

01:06:26.320 --> 01:06:28.800
10 minutes and there would have
been someone else.

01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:34.400
I can still see that
boy's face staring up at me.

01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.840
Yeah, but--
but it was an accident.

01:06:38.880 --> 01:06:40.800
You were trying
to stop a guy,

01:06:40.880 --> 01:06:44.120
and the-- the boy
g-got caught

01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:45.640
in the crossfire,
right?

01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:47.400
No, I panicked.

01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.320
There was no shooter.

01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:51.240
Just the boy.

01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:54.280
Antoine Harris
was his name.

01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:57.120
He was big for his age,
only 13 years old.

01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:59.880
He was a good kid.
Thought it was a joke,

01:06:59.920 --> 01:07:01.760
waving around an air gun
at his friend

01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.400
in the Big 5.

01:07:03.440 --> 01:07:06.320
They were acting out some scene
from some movie they liked.

01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:08.280
Shop girl saw it
from across the way,

01:07:08.320 --> 01:07:11.680
called 911.

01:07:11.760 --> 01:07:14.560
Jesus, that's terrible.

01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:17.080
That...

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:19.560
well, you didn't know.

01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.560
It could have
been real.

01:07:21.600 --> 01:07:23.560
But it wasn't.

01:07:29.160 --> 01:07:31.720
His parents...

01:07:31.760 --> 01:07:34.240
uh, his parents--

01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.880
I had to...

01:07:55.640 --> 01:07:57.920
I was diagnosed with post-traumatic
stress syndrome

01:07:57.960 --> 01:08:00.960
by three different
psychiatrists.

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.680
That's why I retired.

01:08:03.720 --> 01:08:06.400
I couldn't do
the job anymore.

01:08:11.640 --> 01:08:14.280
- So why don't you do something else?
- Like what?

01:08:14.320 --> 01:08:17.158
Drive a forklift
at Costco?

01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.118
Maybe you could
go back to school.

01:08:22.158 --> 01:08:24.118
I loved my job.

01:08:24.158 --> 01:08:26.319
I don't wanna do
anything else.

01:08:38.559 --> 01:08:41.920
You ever think about the term
"homeland security"?

01:08:43.599 --> 01:08:45.520
I mean,
really think about it?

01:08:51.439 --> 01:08:53.319
The day that
you found out

01:08:53.359 --> 01:08:56.639
that your father had
been killed in Iraq,

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.599
do you remember
that day?

01:08:58.639 --> 01:09:00.158
Can you talk
about that?

01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:02.240
You feel comfortable
talking about that?

01:09:06.479 --> 01:09:10.200
After the men came

01:09:10.240 --> 01:09:12.720
to tell my mom,

01:09:12.760 --> 01:09:15.040
I cried,

01:09:15.078 --> 01:09:18.439
but she didn't.

01:09:18.479 --> 01:09:21.000
She just went up
to her room

01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.800
and grabbed the pillows
off the bed,

01:09:24.840 --> 01:09:27.680
cut the tops off of them
with a pair scissors.

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:33.118
There were feathers
all over the place.

01:09:34.439 --> 01:09:36.520
That must have really
frightened you.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:41.118
No, she was trying
to find the crown.

01:09:42.158 --> 01:09:43.720
The crown?

01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:45.639
The crown you leave
in your pillow

01:09:45.639 --> 01:09:48.040
when you've slept on it
for a long time.

01:09:50.319 --> 01:09:52.599
My--

01:09:52.639 --> 01:09:55.200
my father had
two crowns.

01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:58.440
Stop there.

01:09:58.480 --> 01:10:01.560
- You hungry?
- No.

01:10:01.600 --> 01:10:03.320
Mind if I get
some lunch?

01:10:03.360 --> 01:10:06.080
No, go ahead.

01:10:26.680 --> 01:10:28.680
Brad?

01:10:28.720 --> 01:10:32.040
Honey, you there?

01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.560
Pick up.
I know you're there.

01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:38.040
It's Aaron's nap time.

01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:43.680
Okay, I guess you guys
are out somewhere.

01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:46.080
Um...

01:10:46.120 --> 01:10:48.640
I love you both.

01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.680
Bye.

01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.760
I certainly did.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:41.000
Here we go.

01:11:42.640 --> 01:11:44.520
I don't know, Jean.
I don't think I'm up for this.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:46.280
Well, now don't
be silly.

01:11:46.320 --> 01:11:48.360
- It'll be fun.
- Really?

01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.560
You're not the only
little sister here tonight.

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:54.000
- Oh, that's good.
- Oh!

01:11:54.040 --> 01:11:56.000
Hi, would you
like a glass?

01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:59.560
Did anybody like this book?
Because I really just hated it.

01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.360
It's so depressing.

01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:03.400
She cheats on her husband
with two different guys,

01:12:03.440 --> 01:12:06.000
wastes all his money,
then kills herself with rat poison?

01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:08.040
Do I really need
to read this?

01:12:08.080 --> 01:12:11.520
Well, there is a lot
of good descriptive writing.

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:13.480
It's supposed
to be depressing.

01:12:13.480 --> 01:12:15.360
It's a tragedy.

01:12:15.400 --> 01:12:18.680
Madame Bovary was undone
by a tragic flaw.

01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:20.560
What's her flaw?

01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:22.480
Blindness.
She didn't see

01:12:22.520 --> 01:12:24.560
that the men were
just using her.

01:12:24.600 --> 01:12:27.080
She just wants
a little romance in her life.

01:12:27.120 --> 01:12:30.640
- You can't blame her for that.
- It's about women's choices.

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:33.280
Back then, a woman
didn't have a lot of choices.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.400
You could be a nun
or a wife.

01:12:35.440 --> 01:12:38.920
- That's all there was.
- Or a prostitute.

01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.040
She had a choice.

01:12:40.080 --> 01:12:42.640
She had a choice not
to cheat on her husband.

01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:46.280
I found it refreshing
to read about a woman

01:12:46.320 --> 01:12:48.120
reclaiming her sexuality.

01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:50.320
Is that a nice way
of saying she's a slut?

01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:52.880
Madame Bovary's
not a slut.

01:12:52.920 --> 01:12:56.680
She's one of the great
characters in Western literature.

01:12:56.720 --> 01:13:00.120
I was a little puzzled
by some of the sexual references.

01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:01.800
Look,
like this one.

01:13:01.840 --> 01:13:04.240
Um...

01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.760
"He abandoned
every last shred

01:13:06.800 --> 01:13:08.680
of restraint
and consideration.

01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:12.080
He turned her
into something compliant,

01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:14.560
something corrupt."

01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.560
Does anyone know
what that means?

01:13:20.600 --> 01:13:22.280
It means
she's a slut.

01:13:22.320 --> 01:13:24.200
Is he tying her up

01:13:24.240 --> 01:13:26.240
or something?

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.720
Anal sex.

01:13:28.760 --> 01:13:30.920
Mm-hmm.
Mm-hmm.

01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:34.480
Did everyone get that
but me?

01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:37.320
Let's set that aside
for now.

01:13:37.360 --> 01:13:39.240
I'm really eager
to hear what

01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:42.000
our other little sister
has to say.

01:13:42.040 --> 01:13:44.560
I'm not sure if you know this,
but Sarah has a Ph.D

01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:47.400
in English lit.

01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.480
Just a masters.

01:13:49.480 --> 01:13:51.400
I never wrote
my dissertation.

01:13:51.400 --> 01:13:54.440
Well, you still have
a lot more expertise

01:13:54.480 --> 01:13:56.680
than the rest of us.

01:14:01.320 --> 01:14:03.920
I think I understand
your feelings about this book.

01:14:03.960 --> 01:14:07.400
I used to have some
problems with it myself.

01:14:07.440 --> 01:14:09.320
When I read it
in grad school,

01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.240
Madame Bovary just
seemed like a fool.

01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.520
She marries
the wrong man,

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:18.040
makes one foolish mistake
after another.

01:14:18.080 --> 01:14:21.640
But when I read it this time,
I just fell in love with her.

01:14:21.680 --> 01:14:24.240
She's trapped.

01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:27.080
She has a choice. She can either
accept a life of misery

01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:30.520
or she can struggle
against it.

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:32.720
And she chooses
to struggle.

01:14:32.760 --> 01:14:34.960
Some struggle--
hop into bed

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:36.880
with every guy
who says hello.

01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:40.320
Well, she fails in the end, but there's
something beautiful

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.680
and even heroic
in her rebellion.

01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:46.120
My professors would
kill me for even thinking this,

01:14:46.120 --> 01:14:48.240
but...

01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.680
in her own
strange way,

01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:52.600
Emma Bovary
is a feminist.

01:14:52.640 --> 01:14:54.480
Oh, that's nice.

01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:57.240
So now cheating on your husband
makes you a feminist?

01:14:57.280 --> 01:14:59.800
No no no.

01:14:59.840 --> 01:15:03.280
It's not the cheating.
It's the hunger.

01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:05.640
The hunger
for an alternative,

01:15:05.640 --> 01:15:08.880
and the refusal to accept
a life of unhappiness.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.000
Maybe I didn't
understand the book.

01:15:21.120 --> 01:15:22.960
She just looks
so pathetic.

01:15:24.640 --> 01:15:26.440
Is she pretty?

01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:29.640
Who?

01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:33.960
Your wife.

01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:35.880
Degrading yourself
for nothing.

01:15:35.920 --> 01:15:38.480
It's a simple question.

01:15:38.520 --> 01:15:40.800
She's pretty, okay?
Do we have to talk about this now?

01:15:42.920 --> 01:15:46.280
I mean, did she really think a man like
that was gonna run away with her?

01:15:49.960 --> 01:15:52.640
Possibly.

01:15:54.040 --> 01:15:55.920
How pretty is she?

01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:02.920
A knockout.

01:16:07.160 --> 01:16:09.200
Beauty's overrated,
Sarah.

01:16:14.080 --> 01:16:17.080
Brad had meant this
to be comforting.

01:16:17.120 --> 01:16:20.680
But at 3:00 in the morning, it had
precisely the opposite effect.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:24.800
He had a beautiful wife,

01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:28.400
a knockout, and she was sleeping
beside him right now.

01:16:29.960 --> 01:16:32.000
Only someone who took
his own beauty for granted

01:16:32.040 --> 01:16:34.600
would have been able
to say something so stupid

01:16:34.640 --> 01:16:36.680
and with a straight face.

01:16:59.680 --> 01:17:02.280
Weekends were difficult
for Sarah.

01:17:02.320 --> 01:17:03.880
48-hour prison stretches

01:17:03.920 --> 01:17:06.720
separating one happy blur
of weekdays

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.760
from the rest.

01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:13.880
I'm going to the ocean.

01:17:13.920 --> 01:17:16.520
- You are?
- I'm going to the ocean.

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:18.760
Is he doing
his ocean dance?

01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:26.120
Sarah sometimes let herself
be carried away by fantasies

01:17:26.160 --> 01:17:29.800
of a future very different from the life
she was living now,

01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.040
in which she and Brad were
free to love each other

01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:33.800
in broad daylight;

01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.480
where they had no one
to answer to

01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:37.800
but each other.

01:17:37.840 --> 01:17:41.440
It could happen,
she thought. It had to,

01:17:41.480 --> 01:17:43.840
because she wasn't sure she
could keep living like this

01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:46.280
for very much longer.

01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:55.120
Open your mouth again.

01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.960
No, I don't want to.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:00.800
May your mouth
be open.

01:18:00.840 --> 01:18:02.720
May your mouth.

01:18:02.800 --> 01:18:05.160
This is coming
into your mouth.

01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:09.680
Open your mouth,
little fishy.

01:18:09.720 --> 01:18:12.000
Hungry, hungry.

01:18:13.440 --> 01:18:16.040
Little fishy
is not hungry?

01:18:18.840 --> 01:18:20.800
You okay?

01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.560
Yeah, fine.

01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.640
- How about you?
- Great.

01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.240
So how was
your weekend?

01:18:37.160 --> 01:18:39.560
You really wanna know?
It sucked.

01:18:41.600 --> 01:18:43.440
How was yours?

01:18:43.480 --> 01:18:45.520
Terrible.

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:48.800
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:50.760 --> 01:18:53.080
Yeah, we went to the beach
and all Kathy and I did

01:18:53.120 --> 01:18:55.720
was argue
the whole time.

01:18:55.760 --> 01:18:59.040
Oh, you did?

01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:03.280
Yeah, it was our
annual argument

01:19:03.320 --> 01:19:06.160
over taking
the bar exam,

01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:08.160
like our whole life
depends on it.

01:19:08.200 --> 01:19:10.560
Get it over with.
You'll feel better.

01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:12.680
It's this whole thing.

01:19:12.720 --> 01:19:15.080
Gotta take a train
on Wednesday.

01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:17.880
It's a two-day ordeal.

01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:20.200
I'm not even
gonna pass.

01:19:20.200 --> 01:19:22.600
- You'll be fine.
- No.

01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:26.400
No, I won't.

01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:28.760
I haven't cracked
a book all summer.

01:19:37.480 --> 01:19:40.200
I missed you.

01:19:40.200 --> 01:19:42.840
I missed you, too.

01:19:47.880 --> 01:19:50.280
Don't-- don't do it.

01:19:51.360 --> 01:19:53.480
- What?
- The test.

01:19:53.480 --> 01:19:56.120
- Oh.
- Blow it off.

01:19:56.160 --> 01:19:58.560
We should go somewhere,

01:19:58.600 --> 01:20:00.480
just for a night,
you know?

01:20:00.520 --> 01:20:02.280
Richard's out
of town till Friday,

01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.320
and I'm sure I can get
a sitter for Lucy.

01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.360
No, I can't do that.

01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:12.880
I gotta take the test.

01:20:23.320 --> 01:20:25.800
That's good.

01:20:25.840 --> 01:20:28.280
- Looks good?
- Yeah.

01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:30.240
Well, I have a good
feeling about this whole thing.

01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:33.120
In fact, I think I'm gonna go buy
a bottle of champagne

01:20:33.160 --> 01:20:35.400
and put it in the fridge,
and we can open it to celebrate

01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:37.880
when we get
the good news.

01:20:37.920 --> 01:20:40.800
Don't get your hopes up.

01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:42.760
We've been
through this before.

01:20:42.760 --> 01:20:45.640
Huh-uh. This time's
gonna be different.

01:20:45.680 --> 01:20:47.680
I can feel it.

01:21:16.960 --> 01:21:20.200
Can you believe it?
This is our first date.

01:21:20.240 --> 01:21:23.360
Like a date, you know,
without the kids, I mean.

01:21:23.400 --> 01:21:26.480
How was Lucy?
Did she cry or anything?

01:21:26.520 --> 01:21:28.600
No, are you kidding?

01:21:28.640 --> 01:21:31.280
With Jean there, she
just about shoved me out the door.

01:21:35.600 --> 01:21:39.360
I thought we could make something
really beautiful.

01:21:39.400 --> 01:21:42.440
I have so
many things here.

01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:45.000
We could make...

01:21:45.040 --> 01:21:47.280
a picture frame.

01:21:48.760 --> 01:21:52.600
Or a jewelry box.

01:21:53.640 --> 01:21:57.480
Or a hat.

01:21:59.400 --> 01:22:02.440
Something for my mommy.

01:22:02.440 --> 01:22:04.360
Okay.

01:22:07.080 --> 01:22:08.440
- Stop it, stop it.
- No, Ronnie.

01:22:08.480 --> 01:22:11.000
Ron-- Ron-- Ronnie,
just hold on.

01:22:11.040 --> 01:22:14.080
Now there.

01:22:14.120 --> 01:22:17.440
You look handsome.
She won't be disappointed.

01:22:17.480 --> 01:22:20.360
Wait'll she hears
about my criminal record.

01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:22.600
I don't think you need
to get into that just yet.

01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:24.800
Why don't you stick
to small talk?

01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:27.680
What if someone
recognizes me?

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.040
That's highly unlikely.
I made the dinner reservation

01:22:31.080 --> 01:22:33.440
at a restaurant over
in Haverhill.

01:22:49.640 --> 01:22:51.560
Sheila.

01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:56.120
- Sheila.
- Yeah.

01:22:59.440 --> 01:23:01.800
Something wrong
with the food?

01:23:03.320 --> 01:23:05.520
No, it's fine.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:09.320
Back at the house you
mentioned you were on medication.

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:15.000
- What kind?
- All kinds.

01:23:15.040 --> 01:23:16.960
Mostly psychotropic.

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:23.240
So you had some kind
of a breakdown?

01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:26.880
Mm-hmm, my junior year
in college.

01:23:26.920 --> 01:23:28.880
You were that young?

01:23:30.800 --> 01:23:32.840
What happened?

01:23:32.880 --> 01:23:35.480
I don't really know.

01:23:35.520 --> 01:23:38.560
Well, nervous breakdowns
don't just come out of nowhere.

01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.040
Something must have
caused it.

01:23:42.080 --> 01:23:44.600
I guess.

01:23:44.640 --> 01:23:47.480
But I was fine before
I left for college.

01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:51.280
I don't know.
Maybe it was the stress

01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.080
of being on my own.

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:55.760
Maybe it's a chemical
imbalance in my brain.

01:23:55.800 --> 01:23:58.920
Every psychiatrist I go to
has a different opinion.

01:23:58.960 --> 01:24:02.000
This one guy, Dr. Faris,

01:24:02.040 --> 01:24:05.680
he said I must have been
sexually abused as a child.

01:24:05.720 --> 01:24:07.200
When I told him
I wasn't,

01:24:07.240 --> 01:24:09.720
he said I must be
repressing the memory.

01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.400
Right, um, so what
happened after that?

01:24:13.440 --> 01:24:15.240
Did you drop out
of school?

01:24:15.240 --> 01:24:17.960
Not right away.

01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:20.080
My mother wanted me
to go

01:24:20.120 --> 01:24:22.080
to the campus
counseling center.

01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:24.560
And they wanted
the problem fixed, like I could just

01:24:24.600 --> 01:24:27.400
snap my fingers and everything
would be okay again.

01:24:27.440 --> 01:24:29.800
Yeah, I know
all about that.

01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:33.160
You do?

01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:36.560
Yes, I do.

01:24:39.560 --> 01:24:43.120
So they said
I could leave school

01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:45.760
and get married and have lots of kids
like my sisters,

01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:47.840
and I can't take care
of kids.

01:24:47.880 --> 01:24:50.120
I can't even take care
of myself

01:24:50.160 --> 01:24:53.200
most of the time.
Besides, who's gonna marry me?

01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:56.520
You're not so bad.

01:24:56.560 --> 01:24:58.520
What?

01:24:59.680 --> 01:25:02.120
You're--
you're not so bad.

01:25:07.720 --> 01:25:10.080
I haven't had
a real boyfriend in six years,

01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.000
not since my second
breakdown.

01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:15.720
I had this thing happen
on a Greyhound bus.

01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.720
- I was--
- Do you want me to wrap that up?

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:21.400
Oh, no, thank you.

01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:24.160
No, wrap it up, please.
I'll take it home.

01:25:24.200 --> 01:25:26.720
Folks gonna want dessert?

01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:29.720
What do you say, Sheila?
You wanna share something sweet?

01:25:34.560 --> 01:25:36.880
Let's make a little stop.

01:25:36.920 --> 01:25:38.640
Take the next left.

01:25:45.080 --> 01:25:47.440
Turn off the lights.

01:25:54.720 --> 01:25:56.760
I had
a nice time tonight.

01:26:03.520 --> 01:26:05.920
The last guy
I went out with,

01:26:05.960 --> 01:26:07.720
you know what he did?

01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:10.520
He ditched me.

01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:13.440
He got up to go
to the men's room,

01:26:13.480 --> 01:26:15.440
never came back.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:20.560
Stuck me with the check.

01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:22.960
Never said goodbye.

01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.920
Never called
to apologize.

01:26:25.960 --> 01:26:29.360
He wasn't my type anyway.
He was a big-shot CPA.

01:26:29.400 --> 01:26:32.760
Super normal guy.
Didn't want to be dating some psycho.

01:26:40.160 --> 01:26:42.280
But you seem like
a nice person.

01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.640
Better not tell on me.

01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:17.680
You hear me?

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.840
You better not tell,
or I'll fucking get you.

01:28:22.160 --> 01:28:24.840
Hold on, Mom.
Hold on, Dad.

01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:28.360
You should park the car
on the escalator, and back...

01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:30.720
- So?
- What?

01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.560
- Up, down and then up.
- Test, dummy. How'd it go?

01:28:34.600 --> 01:28:36.480
It was all right.

01:28:38.560 --> 01:28:40.520
You didn't call home
last night.

01:28:40.560 --> 01:28:42.120
I was worried.

01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:44.160
Go on the escalator.

01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:46.160
Guess I could really use
that cellphone.

01:28:47.480 --> 01:28:52.120
Go on the escalator.

01:29:19.680 --> 01:29:22.360
- Well, look who's back.
- Oh, hi.

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:24.640
Hi, Jean.

01:29:24.680 --> 01:29:26.560
Thanks.

01:29:26.600 --> 01:29:28.440
You're a lifesaver.

01:29:28.480 --> 01:29:30.360
So how was
your old roommate?

01:29:30.400 --> 01:29:31.720
Oh, great.

01:29:31.720 --> 01:29:34.520
Yeah, thanks for doing this
on such short notice.

01:29:34.560 --> 01:29:37.800
Let me give you something
for your time.

01:29:37.800 --> 01:29:40.040
That's not necessary.

01:29:40.040 --> 01:29:43.280
No, really.
I insist.

01:29:44.560 --> 01:29:46.120
Please don't.

01:29:49.200 --> 01:29:50.760
Okay.

01:29:50.800 --> 01:29:53.000
Uh, any calls?

01:29:53.040 --> 01:29:54.560
Nope,
it was very quiet.

01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:57.920
She's asleep on your bed.
It was a very busy day.

01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:59.720
That's great.

01:29:59.760 --> 01:30:02.720
Um, Jean,
is everything okay?

01:30:06.040 --> 01:30:08.480
Yeah, she's
a wonderful child.

01:30:26.920 --> 01:30:28.840
Mommy.

01:30:39.400 --> 01:30:41.320
Mommy!

01:30:42.440 --> 01:30:44.000
Yeah.

01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:46.320
Are you coming?

01:30:49.840 --> 01:30:53.240
- I have something.
- What?

01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:55.320
I have something
for you.

01:30:59.400 --> 01:31:01.640
Just give me
a second here, okay?

01:31:28.160 --> 01:31:30.200
Brad.

01:31:34.520 --> 01:31:36.880
Brad.

01:31:37.960 --> 01:31:39.840
Hmm.

01:31:41.480 --> 01:31:44.440
Aaron's been telling me
about his new friend Lucy.

01:31:45.400 --> 01:31:47.880
She sounds like
a sweet little girl.

01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.280
What's her mother like?

01:31:55.480 --> 01:31:58.680
Nice enough, I guess.

01:31:58.720 --> 01:32:01.000
I can't even
remember her name.

01:32:04.680 --> 01:32:06.720
Isn't it Sarah?

01:32:08.040 --> 01:32:10.600
Sarah?

01:32:10.640 --> 01:32:12.920
Yeah, Sarah,

01:32:12.960 --> 01:32:14.520
from the pool.

01:32:14.560 --> 01:32:17.680
Her daughter's name
is Lucy.

01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:20.040
Oh, Lucy's mom.
Yeah, I forgot. That's right.

01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:22.720
Her name is Sarah.

01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:25.800
Hmm.

01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:27.920
Yeah, it might be
really nice for Aaron

01:32:27.960 --> 01:32:31.040
if they came over
for dinner.

01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:36.840
Okay.

01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:01.320
So you're
in advertising?

01:33:01.360 --> 01:33:04.080
No, that's-- that's
a common misconception.

01:33:04.120 --> 01:33:06.040
I'm not in advertising.
I'm in branding.

01:33:06.080 --> 01:33:08.080
And that's very different.

01:33:08.120 --> 01:33:10.160
Richard's pretty high up
in the company.

01:33:10.200 --> 01:33:12.080
Yeah yeah,
I have these clients

01:33:12.120 --> 01:33:13.800
and they'll come to me
when they have,

01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:16.040
you know, a new product
they wanna sell.

01:33:16.040 --> 01:33:19.320
Like, um, these guys,
they were in a couple weeks ago.

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:22.280
They're trying to open this chain
of Chinese restaurants, right?

01:33:22.320 --> 01:33:25.640
They're talking to me
and I-- I look down at the table

01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:27.880
and I realize that none
of these guys were Chinese.

01:33:27.920 --> 01:33:30.760
Where were they from?

01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.800
They're a bunch of fat cats
from Tennessee.

01:33:32.840 --> 01:33:35.400
They think they can start a chain
of Chinese restaurants good enough

01:33:35.440 --> 01:33:37.320
to fool the average
American boob.

01:33:37.360 --> 01:33:39.320
Oh, God.

01:33:39.360 --> 01:33:41.840
Mmm!

01:33:41.880 --> 01:33:43.720
- This is delicious.
- Isn't it?

01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:46.240
Brad's a fantastic cook.

01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:49.480
So you guys see these
fliers with the guy's face

01:33:49.520 --> 01:33:51.280
plastered all over
our village?

01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.800
Lots of Sturm und Drang
in our quiet little town, huh?

01:33:53.840 --> 01:33:55.440
Yeah, it's crazy.

01:33:55.480 --> 01:33:57.920
What I want to know is why they let
a creep like that out of prison.

01:33:57.960 --> 01:34:00.680
Some of the people
going after him are just as crazy.

01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:03.560
- What do you mean?
- Well, just today I heard that

01:34:03.600 --> 01:34:05.680
some nut's been spray-painting
the poor guy's house,

01:34:05.720 --> 01:34:08.840
lighting fires on his porch.
God knows what else.

01:34:08.840 --> 01:34:10.760
- Do they know who's doing it?
- Huh-uh.

01:34:10.760 --> 01:34:12.680
They think
it's some ex-cop.

01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:14.680
You know, that guy
who killed that kid at the mall.

01:34:14.720 --> 01:34:16.400
Yeah, I don't think
it's him.

01:34:16.440 --> 01:34:19.080
You're biased.
You're friends with the guy.

01:34:19.080 --> 01:34:22.000
Brad's on that Committee
of Concerned Parents

01:34:22.040 --> 01:34:23.600
with him.

01:34:23.640 --> 01:34:25.400
I didn't know
you were on that.

01:34:25.440 --> 01:34:27.840
I play on his
football team.

01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:30.960
He asked me to distribute
some fliers.

01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:32.960
He's on your team.

01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.840
You never told me that.

01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:37.480
Yeah.

01:34:39.720 --> 01:34:43.200
You know what's weird?
I've never even seen this McGorvey guy.

01:34:43.240 --> 01:34:45.400
- We did.
- No, we didn't.

01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:47.360
Not you.
Me and Brad.

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:50.320
That day at the pool,
remember?

01:34:50.360 --> 01:34:53.480
Yeah, I-I
totally forgot.

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:58.560
- Well, what happened?
- Sexual tension is an elusive thing,

01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:00.840
but Kathy had
pretty good radar for it.

01:35:00.840 --> 01:35:04.320
It was like someone had
turned a knob a hair to the right,

01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:06.800
and the radio station
clicked in so loud and clear

01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.480
it almost
knocked her over.

01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:11.880
Once she became aware
of the connection between them,

01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:14.880
it seemed impossible that
she'd missed it before.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:17.440
On a hunch,
Kathy dropped her fork

01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:19.600
in the hopes that
while retrieving it

01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:22.880
she would catch Sarah
and Brad playing footsie,

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.160
- but she was mistaken.
- Asked him to leave, and he left.

01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:28.360
But you know what?
He didn't look scary, right? I mean--

01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:31.080
No, it-- it wasn't that big
of a deal, you know.

01:35:31.120 --> 01:35:33.720
- No, he's like a regular guy, you know?
- Yeah, I mean--

01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:35.680
Kathy, are you okay?

01:35:35.720 --> 01:35:37.560
Uh, yeah.

01:35:37.600 --> 01:35:40.600
Just a sec.

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.240
Brad had convinced
himself

01:35:42.280 --> 01:35:44.640
the dinner party
had gone well.

01:35:44.680 --> 01:35:48.040
That he and Sarah had managed
to put Kathy's suspicions to rest,

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:50.200
at least temporarily.

01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:52.360
She certainly hadn't
accused him of anything,

01:35:52.360 --> 01:35:54.280
or behaved in a way
that made him think

01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:56.240
she'd noticed
anything untoward.

01:36:01.280 --> 01:36:04.640
I'm really glad
they came over.

01:36:10.160 --> 01:36:12.960
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.640
Two days later, however,

01:36:14.680 --> 01:36:16.880
his mother-in-law showed up
for a surprise visit...

01:36:16.920 --> 01:36:19.720
- Thank you, John.
- ...of ominously indeterminate length.

01:36:19.760 --> 01:36:22.440
And from that moment on,
she accompanied Brad

01:36:22.480 --> 01:36:24.200
and Aaron everywhere:

01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:26.000
To the playground;

01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:28.840
- We need some butter.
- To the supermarket;

01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:31.280
And to the town pool.

01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:33.880
Hi, Aaron.

01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:37.080
Hi, Lucy.

01:36:38.440 --> 01:36:41.120
The worst of it
was the pool.

01:36:41.160 --> 01:36:43.720
Nevertheless,
after threatening all week

01:36:43.760 --> 01:36:46.920
to go the football game,
Brad's mother-in-law decided against it

01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.840
at the last minute.

01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:50.840
- So are you coming?
- Well, I'd like to,

01:36:50.880 --> 01:36:52.760
but I'm a little tired.

01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:55.040
You sure?
You're welcome to.

01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.960
No, go ahead.
You and Aaron

01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.160
sure kept me hopping
this afternoon.

01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:01.200
Looks like
you're on your own.

01:37:01.240 --> 01:37:04.080
Oh, that's my ride.

01:37:04.120 --> 01:37:06.760
- What time are you gonna be home?
- I don't know.

01:37:06.760 --> 01:37:08.440
Pretty late, though.

01:37:08.480 --> 01:37:11.320
Be careful and stay
out of trouble.

01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:26.320
Winds whisper
of high hopes,

01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.400
victory is in the skies.

01:37:28.440 --> 01:37:31.680
One joins with many
on the summer's green field.

01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.760
At 0 and 5, the Guardians
were the basement dwellers

01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:37.480
of the Tri-County
Touch Football Night League.

01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:41.240
The Controllers, a team of young
hotshots from the financial district

01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.040
were 4 and 1
with an explosive offense

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:47.240
that regularly racked up
40 to 50 points a game.

01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:49.280
But from
the opening kickoff,

01:37:49.320 --> 01:37:52.680
this ragtag group
of law enforcement officers

01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.840
decided to crunch
their own numbers.

01:37:58.400 --> 01:38:00.600
But the Controllers
scored first

01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:02.560
after recovering
a Bart Williams fumble

01:38:02.600 --> 01:38:06.360
deep in Guardians' territory near
the end of the second quarter.

01:38:10.920 --> 01:38:13.880
The Guardians evened things up early
in the second half...

01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:17.800
moving methodically
downfield

01:38:17.800 --> 01:38:19.960
on an 80-yard
touchdown drive.

01:38:24.800 --> 01:38:27.880
The Controllers regained the lead
with a fourth quarter field goal.

01:38:27.920 --> 01:38:31.400
With less than a minute
to go, trailing by three,

01:38:31.440 --> 01:38:33.400
the Guardians faced
the extinction of their hopes.

01:38:33.440 --> 01:38:35.840
- Down!
- It was their last chance--

01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:38.280
4th and 5
on their own 35.

01:38:38.280 --> 01:38:41.000
Set!

01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.640
Hut, hut!

01:39:15.080 --> 01:39:18.080
Yeah yeah yeah!

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:23.280
Yeah yeah!

01:39:24.520 --> 01:39:27.040
Yeah!

01:39:28.120 --> 01:39:29.600
Oh my God!

01:39:29.640 --> 01:39:32.520
Yeah!

01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:45.040
Brad, Brad!

01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.680
What do you want?

01:39:47.720 --> 01:39:51.200
Everyone is waiting for us at the bar.
Are-- are-- are you coming?

01:39:51.240 --> 01:39:53.360
Why don't you go on ahead?
I'll catch up later.

01:39:53.400 --> 01:39:55.920
You're gonna come, right?
I mean, we gotta celebrate.

01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.600
Yeah yeah yeah,
I'll be there.

01:39:57.640 --> 01:40:00.480
- You promise?
- Jesus, Larry, I just told you.

01:40:00.520 --> 01:40:03.720
- Well, you got a ride?
- Yeah.

01:40:05.320 --> 01:40:07.720
Okay.

01:40:07.720 --> 01:40:09.760
I'll have a cold one
waiting for you.

01:40:13.720 --> 01:40:15.600
Larry, you have
to go home now.

01:40:15.640 --> 01:40:17.880
Just give me five more minutes.
He promised he was coming.

01:40:17.920 --> 01:40:20.640
I don't care what he promised,
I want to lock up.

01:40:20.680 --> 01:40:22.720
Now get your butt
out of here!

01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:25.280
Now!

01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:35.520
When I looked up there
and saw you it was just...

01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:39.720
wow... wow.

01:40:39.720 --> 01:40:42.920
Thank God you came.

01:40:42.920 --> 01:40:46.080
I don't want
to go home.

01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.360
I want to stay
right here forever.

01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:51.160
No, I do.
For the first time in my life

01:40:51.200 --> 01:40:53.800
I feel like anything is possible.
Like I can do anything, you know?

01:40:58.200 --> 01:41:00.400
What are we doing?

01:41:00.440 --> 01:41:03.920
What do you mean?

01:41:03.960 --> 01:41:06.880
It's not real, Brad.

01:41:06.920 --> 01:41:08.600
What?

01:41:08.640 --> 01:41:11.400
This. It's wrong
and it's weird.

01:41:11.440 --> 01:41:13.120
How long are we
gonna sneak around together?

01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:15.120
How long can that last?
I can't do this anymore.

01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:16.520
No, no don't
say that.

01:41:16.520 --> 01:41:20.040
As long as I know that
we're gonna have this--

01:41:20.080 --> 01:41:21.480
Have what?

01:41:21.480 --> 01:41:24.400
What is this?

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:26.560
Look...

01:41:26.600 --> 01:41:29.280
if that dinner at your house
was any indication,

01:41:29.320 --> 01:41:32.120
you seem pretty happy
with your wife.

01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:33.720
You know, you have
a perfect life

01:41:33.760 --> 01:41:35.680
- and I don't wanna to be the--
- Okay, stop stop stop.

01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:40.720
Run away with me.

01:41:40.760 --> 01:41:42.560
What?

01:41:44.840 --> 01:41:46.880
You don't mean that.

01:41:46.920 --> 01:41:51.480
You believe in me.

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:53.840
Come on.

01:41:53.880 --> 01:41:56.840
We'll go away,
figure this thing out.

01:41:56.880 --> 01:42:00.000
It's not weird.

01:42:00.040 --> 01:42:02.880
The kids are comfortable
with each other.

01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:05.920
I know there's more
to it than that, but...

01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:08.480
let's do this.

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:11.720
Please.
Please, Sarah.

01:42:14.080 --> 01:42:16.800
Oh my God.

01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:20.160
You really mean
it, don't you?

01:42:20.200 --> 01:42:22.640
Yes.

01:42:24.520 --> 01:42:28.000
Okay.

01:42:28.040 --> 01:42:30.560
Okay. Okay.
Yes!

01:42:30.600 --> 01:42:33.320
Yes!
Okay, yes.

01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.000
Fucking Brad, I'm so
sick of hearing about Brad.

01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:42.560
I'm fucking over it.

01:42:42.600 --> 01:42:45.760
I don't even like him.
He's a loser.

01:42:45.800 --> 01:42:47.360
"Brad made
the fucking touchdown."

01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:49.280
Yeah, you know why
he hasn't the balls to show up here?

01:42:49.320 --> 01:42:52.360
'Cause I fucking made the block.
It's bullshit.

01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:55.200
That's why he's not even here,
he's fucking embarrassed to see me.

01:42:55.240 --> 01:42:59.640
I don't even like anybody
in this fucking town.

01:43:11.840 --> 01:43:14.120
Wake up, wake up!

01:43:14.120 --> 01:43:17.080
Wake up, Woodward Court!

01:43:17.120 --> 01:43:18.640
Okay, I'm awake.

01:43:18.680 --> 01:43:23.040
Open your eyes! Get your goddamn heads
out of the sand!

01:43:23.080 --> 01:43:25.320
My heads?
My goddamn heads?

01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:27.360
Don't you people
love your children?

01:43:27.400 --> 01:43:30.400
Don't you want
to protect them from evil?

01:43:30.440 --> 01:43:33.440
Woodward Court,
there's a pervert in your midst!

01:43:33.480 --> 01:43:36.000
There's a goddamn
pervert in your midst!

01:43:36.040 --> 01:43:38.960
Open your eyes!
Protect the children!

01:43:39.000 --> 01:43:40.920
Save the children!

01:43:40.960 --> 01:43:43.560
Wake up
and see the grass!

01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.680
- Just stay inside, Ronnie.
- Save the children!

01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:47.400
Open your goddamn eyes!

01:43:47.440 --> 01:43:50.240
Wake up and save
your children!

01:43:50.280 --> 01:43:53.960
You dirty son of a bitch!
Get off my lawn!

01:43:54.000 --> 01:43:56.960
Who the hell do you think you are,
Mr. High and Mighty?

01:43:57.000 --> 01:44:01.160
No perverts
in Woodward Court!

01:44:01.160 --> 01:44:02.800
You think you're God?
Far from it!

01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:05.120
I don't think I'm God!
I never said I was!

01:44:05.160 --> 01:44:06.880
You murderer, you
killed the boy.

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:09.520
I didn't murder anyone. Now why don't
you go back inside, put some clothes on?

01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.600
You shot him through the neck.
I read it in the paper.

01:44:11.640 --> 01:44:14.360
- No perverts in--
- You son of a bitch. Give me that.

01:44:14.400 --> 01:44:16.640
Hey hey!

01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:17.840
Give me that!
You're--

01:44:17.880 --> 01:44:19.680
- You need to go home.
- The police are coming.

01:44:19.720 --> 01:44:21.000
I mean, you're
scaring my kids.

01:44:21.040 --> 01:44:23.240
Your kids need
to be frightened!

01:44:23.240 --> 01:44:24.960
They live across
the street from a pervert!

01:44:27.000 --> 01:44:28.680
Ow! Oh!

01:44:28.680 --> 01:44:31.560
Oh my God, Mrs. McGorvey.
Are you okay?

01:44:33.160 --> 01:44:36.440
May. May!

01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:38.720
May-- I think we should
call an ambulance.

01:44:38.760 --> 01:44:40.960
Karen, call an
ambulance, right now!

01:44:41.000 --> 01:44:43.120
- I'm doing it!
- Oh, fuck.

01:44:43.160 --> 01:44:47.720
- May!
- This is all I need.

01:44:55.000 --> 01:44:57.880
Excuse me, Mr. McGorvey,
we need to ask you some questions.

01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:35.680
$14.35.

01:45:47.560 --> 01:45:50.280
The Fed continuing its
campaign against inflation

01:45:50.320 --> 01:45:53.880
by raising short-term interest rates
for the 10th time yesterday.

01:45:53.920 --> 01:45:57.280
Usually there is a correlation between
inflation and gold prices.

01:45:57.320 --> 01:46:00.120
Let's take you over
to our stocks desk...

01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:04.360
Cafe con leche?

01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:06.040
Thank you.

01:46:09.680 --> 01:46:16.360
Kim Bryson, please call
the operator.

01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.240
Madre.

01:46:23.360 --> 01:46:27.120
Me too.
She's resting.

01:47:09.120 --> 01:47:11.200
Get down, knock it off!

01:47:11.240 --> 01:47:13.040
Quiet.

01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:15.880
Bring him around.

01:47:24.080 --> 01:47:25.960
It's all yours.

01:48:13.000 --> 01:48:14.720
Mr. McGorvey.

01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:19.440
Mr. McGorvey.

01:48:19.480 --> 01:48:21.760
I'm afraid we
have some bad news.

01:48:24.360 --> 01:48:26.880
Do you have a mortuary
to make arrangements for you?

01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.680
It's not a problem. The hospital has
a list that I can provide you with.

01:48:32.720 --> 01:48:34.760
Here's what's
going to happen:

01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.320
Your mother's body
will remain in her bed

01:48:37.360 --> 01:48:38.960
for up to three hours.

01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:41.120
Three hours is typical.

01:48:41.160 --> 01:48:44.680
But if there's a request for more time,
depending on our occupancy,

01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:46.800
that's usually
not a problem.

01:48:46.840 --> 01:48:50.400
If there's anyone
you need to call--

01:48:50.440 --> 01:48:52.680
family, friends--

01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:55.080
they're welcome to full
bedside visitation privileges

01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:56.960
before the body is taken
downstairs

01:48:57.000 --> 01:48:59.720
to be prepped
for transport.

01:48:59.760 --> 01:49:02.600
Do you have any questions
that come to mind?

01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:08.880
Anything I can
help you with?

01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.800
- No.
- Okay.

01:49:13.840 --> 01:49:16.680
I'd like to remind you to take your
mother's personal belongings with you

01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:18.880
before you leave
the hospital today.

01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:20.320
And all I need from you now

01:49:20.360 --> 01:49:23.360
is to sign this release-
of-remains form.

01:53:21.280 --> 01:53:23.640
Aaron.

01:53:25.880 --> 01:53:28.520
Hey hey, buddy.

01:53:28.520 --> 01:53:32.400
Can you wake up?

01:53:36.240 --> 01:53:39.480
Could you take your
hat off for me?

01:53:39.520 --> 01:53:42.160
Just for a second.

01:53:47.280 --> 01:53:49.960
Are you mad
at me, Daddy?

01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:54.120
No.
No no no, not at all.

01:53:54.120 --> 01:53:57.960
I just want you to know

01:53:58.000 --> 01:54:00.800
that I love you very much,

01:54:00.840 --> 01:54:05.320
and I would never do
anything to hurt you, okay?

01:54:05.360 --> 01:54:07.920
Okay.

01:54:13.960 --> 01:54:16.960
Now you can go
back to sleep.

01:55:14.120 --> 01:55:17.600
Lucy, come on.

01:55:17.640 --> 01:55:20.440
Let's go.

01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:23.160
I will not go
in the car seat!

01:55:24.920 --> 01:55:28.120
- You have to go in the car--
- I will not go in the car seat!

01:55:28.160 --> 01:55:29.320
Yes, you will!

01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:30.560
- You will go in the car seat.
- No, I won't!

01:55:30.600 --> 01:55:32.080
Yes, you will.
Go in the car seat.

01:55:32.120 --> 01:55:35.880
I will not go
in the car seat!

01:55:35.880 --> 01:55:37.400
Okay, just...

01:55:40.320 --> 01:55:41.760
you don't have to
go in the car seat.

01:55:41.800 --> 01:55:44.160
You can just go here.
No, actually...

01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:45.680
go on the floor.
Okay.

01:55:45.720 --> 01:55:48.040
Okay, go down on the floor.
You have to stay down, okay?

01:55:48.080 --> 01:55:50.600
Mommy is gonna get arrested.
Just stay down, okay?

01:55:50.640 --> 01:55:51.760
Okay.

01:56:09.720 --> 01:56:13.320
Mommy, I want to go home.

01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:15.920
Yeah, in a minute,

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.840
as soon as Brad gets here.

01:56:31.240 --> 01:56:33.600
Hello?

01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:39.600
Ronnie?

01:57:05.720 --> 01:57:07.880
Oh my God.

01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:25.520
- Are you all right?
- Yeah! Let's do it. Let's go!

01:57:28.040 --> 01:57:30.520
Hey, dude!

01:57:30.560 --> 01:57:33.760
What's the hurry?

01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:40.200
Yeah! Oh!

01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:43.840
- This is so sick.
- Damn.

01:57:43.880 --> 01:57:45.600
- Nice.
- Oh, man.

01:57:45.640 --> 01:57:48.120
Yeah, man.

01:57:48.160 --> 01:57:49.640
- How about you take a run?
- What?

01:57:49.680 --> 01:57:52.040
Yeah, give it a shot.
See what happens.

01:57:52.040 --> 01:57:54.880
You guys are crazy,
I can't do that.

01:57:54.920 --> 01:57:58.320
It's not about that,
it's about skating.

01:58:09.000 --> 01:58:11.400
Whoo!

01:58:11.440 --> 01:58:14.920
Come on.
Come on.

01:59:06.080 --> 01:59:07.320
Do you need help?

01:59:16.760 --> 01:59:19.760
She's g-- gone.

01:59:19.800 --> 01:59:22.360
She's gone.

01:59:22.400 --> 01:59:26.560
Who?
Who's gone?

01:59:26.600 --> 01:59:29.680
Mommy.
Mommy's gone.

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:35.560
I...

01:59:35.600 --> 01:59:38.440
I'm sorry.

01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:40.400
She loved me.

01:59:43.720 --> 01:59:46.120
She's the only one.

01:59:49.960 --> 01:59:51.680
Mommy died.

01:59:54.160 --> 01:59:56.160
Mommy died.

02:00:04.360 --> 02:00:06.200
Lucy?

02:00:08.480 --> 02:00:12.960
Lucy! Lucy!

02:00:13.000 --> 02:00:18.160
Lucy!

02:00:18.200 --> 02:00:25.720
Lucy! Lucy!

02:00:29.400 --> 02:00:34.080
Lucy!

02:00:42.880 --> 02:00:46.000
Get in the car seat!
Get in the car seat!

02:01:09.360 --> 02:01:11.640
It's okay, Mommy.

02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:17.040
Lucy.

02:01:25.000 --> 02:01:27.080
I'm sorry.

02:01:27.120 --> 02:01:29.520
I'm so sorry.

02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:38.120
Would you like
to go home?

02:01:38.160 --> 02:01:40.320
Yeah?

02:01:57.480 --> 02:02:00.000
Brad.

02:02:00.040 --> 02:02:02.880
Brad, can you hear me?

02:02:02.920 --> 02:02:06.880
D-- don't move.
The ambulance is on its way.

02:02:06.920 --> 02:02:09.760
Jesus.

02:02:09.800 --> 02:02:11.920
What happened to me?

02:02:11.960 --> 02:02:14.680
These kids say you've been
out cold for the last five minutes.

02:02:14.720 --> 02:02:17.920
- You almost had it.
- Dude, you were awesome.

02:02:17.960 --> 02:02:21.640
- That shit was gnarly, son.
- Back up, back up! Give him some space.

02:02:21.680 --> 02:02:24.600
You just hold still, all right?
Hold still.

02:02:28.760 --> 02:02:30.240
Hey, bro!

02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:33.000
Here, this fell
out of your pocket.

02:02:35.240 --> 02:02:37.160
I don't need it anymore.

02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:39.760
- Hey, Duane.
- Hm?

02:02:39.800 --> 02:02:42.600
Could you call my wife?

02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:44.480
You got it, buddy.

02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:46.560
Here we go.

02:03:06.680 --> 02:03:08.960
I'm so sorry, Ronnie.

02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:13.520
I really am.

02:03:18.560 --> 02:03:22.360
I never wanted anything
like this to happen.

02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:38.240
Are-- are you--
are you okay?

02:03:48.440 --> 02:03:52.240
- Oh, no!
- Gonna be good now.

02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:55.080
Oh my God!

02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:02.000
Hold on, Ronnie.

02:04:02.040 --> 02:04:04.840
You hold on.

02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:07.560
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

02:04:07.560 --> 02:04:10.080
You hold on there,
okay, buddy?

02:04:13.000 --> 02:04:14.840
In his wildest dreams

02:04:14.880 --> 02:04:18.640
Larry would never have imagined
he'd once again be in this position,

02:04:18.680 --> 02:04:21.920
where precious
minutes count.

02:04:21.960 --> 02:04:24.680
Tonight he could
save a life.

02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:27.240
He knew Ronnie had done
some bad things in the past,

02:04:27.280 --> 02:04:31.880
but so had Larry.

02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:34.520
You couldn't
change the past.

02:04:37.000 --> 02:04:40.800
But the future could
be a different story.

02:04:49.240 --> 02:04:51.640
And it had
to start somewhere.
