WEBVTT

00:11.000 --> 00:11.900
( Slurps )

00:12.000 --> 00:14.460
Ah!
That's darn fine coffee.

00:14.560 --> 00:17.220
It'd better be.
You had like 12 cups.

00:17.320 --> 00:20.320
Only thing
that keeps me steady.

00:21.560 --> 00:23.060
You don't want to see him
without it.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.580
Great lunch, guys.
This one's on me.

00:25.680 --> 00:26.700
âGreat!
âDelicious!

00:26.800 --> 00:28.580
You've been
training hard out there.

00:28.680 --> 00:30.140
You earned it.
Oh, waiter!

00:30.240 --> 00:32.240
( Robotic voice ) Food courts
do not have waiters.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.660
( Chuckles )
Yes. Of course.

00:33.760 --> 00:35.980
Go ahead and put all this
on the company tab.

00:36.080 --> 00:38.200
Payment is due in full
immediately.

00:39.880 --> 00:41.660
Uh...
( Chuckles )

00:41.760 --> 00:42.700
Ow!

00:42.800 --> 00:43.980
Okay. Sure.

00:44.080 --> 00:46.940
I'll just get the company
to reimburse me later.

00:47.040 --> 00:49.380
Oh, no...
IâI don't have my wallet.

00:49.480 --> 00:50.420
No wallet.

00:50.520 --> 00:51.380
( Yells )

00:51.480 --> 00:52.340
Hey.
Come on!

00:52.440 --> 00:53.460
Uh, can anyone else

00:53.560 --> 00:54.580
cover lunch today

00:54.680 --> 00:56.980
so I can get out
of this force field?

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
âNo can do.
âI don't have any creds.

00:58.040 --> 00:59.340
( Groans )
All right.

00:59.440 --> 01:01.380
My wallet's
got to be somewhere.

01:01.480 --> 01:02.180
Let's see.

01:02.280 --> 01:04.780
Last night, I definitely had it
at the space club

01:04.880 --> 01:06.880
'cause I bought
the first round of wings.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.100
Then I bought
the last round of wings.

01:08.200 --> 01:09.620
And then...
( Gasps )

01:09.720 --> 01:10.020
What?

01:10.120 --> 01:12.460
I left my wallet
back on mantis planet.

01:12.560 --> 01:14.180
Can you guys go get it for me?

01:14.280 --> 01:15.540
I don't know.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.700
That sounds like a planet
full of mantises.

01:17.800 --> 01:19.180
Oh, it is.

01:19.280 --> 01:21.280
They're cool though
(Chuckles) I swear.

01:20.720 --> 01:22.540
It'll be super easy.
Just in and out.

01:22.640 --> 01:24.820
Think of it as one
of your training exercises.

01:24.920 --> 01:26.940
( Groans )
Let's go get his wallet.

01:27.040 --> 01:28.700
Can we drive?
Why not.

01:28.800 --> 01:31.640
Oh fun!
Manti love robots!

01:33.160 --> 01:34.420
We're getting close.

01:34.520 --> 01:36.520
Aren't you forgetting
something?

01:35.800 --> 01:37.800
Oh, correct.

01:38.360 --> 01:40.360
Hey what's with the beard?

01:39.520 --> 01:41.620
Oh, this?
It is a disguise.

01:41.720 --> 01:44.140
I need the manti to believe
I'm a human being.

01:44.240 --> 01:46.060
Why? I thought you said
they loved robots.

01:46.160 --> 01:47.980
They do!
In their horror movies!

01:48.080 --> 01:48.940
Outside of that,

01:49.040 --> 01:51.340
manti actually find robots
extremely repulsive.

01:51.440 --> 01:54.540
So, you coming with us
isn't gonna be a problem, is it?

01:54.640 --> 01:56.140
I'm quite sure
I'll go undetected

01:56.240 --> 01:58.240
with this beard
and this baseball cap.

02:00.680 --> 02:01.380
( Groans )

02:01.480 --> 02:03.780
As long as we respect
all their customs,

02:03.880 --> 02:04.780
we'll be fine.

02:04.880 --> 02:06.060
Take a left here.

02:11.000 --> 02:11.980
Before we disembark,

02:12.080 --> 02:14.220
there are a few
cultural rules we should ââ

02:14.320 --> 02:16.680
Cool!
Bugs with guns.

02:18.720 --> 02:20.720
We have been commanded
to escort you

02:20.240 --> 02:21.740
to the great mountain
throne room

02:21.840 --> 02:23.980
by decree
of the King of Mantlantis!

02:24.080 --> 02:25.580
Whoa.
The King wants to see us?

02:25.680 --> 02:27.680
Are we in trouble
or something?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.780
Huh? Troubââ No!
No, no!

02:28.880 --> 02:30.880
The King just likes
to meet everyone

02:30.440 --> 02:32.440
who travels
to Mantlantis.

02:31.560 --> 02:33.560
Come along, then.

02:34.320 --> 02:36.700
Eh, uh, you're not
a robot, are you?

02:36.800 --> 02:38.620
I'm, uh, getting
kind of a vibe here.

02:38.720 --> 02:40.060
No, sir.
If I were a robot,

02:40.160 --> 02:41.980
how could I grow
this cool human beard?

02:42.080 --> 02:44.540
Hmm.
It is a pretty sweet beard.

02:44.640 --> 02:45.500
Good coverage, too.

02:45.600 --> 02:46.980
Whenever I try,
it's just like

02:47.080 --> 02:48.660
it doesn't really grow
on the sides.

02:48.760 --> 02:51.060
( Chuckles ) Of course,
it's like a jungle on my thorax,

02:51.160 --> 02:53.540
but isn't that always
the way?
I hear that.

02:53.640 --> 02:55.640
Mordecai and Rigby:
( Chanting ) Mantis King!

02:54.680 --> 02:57.500
Mantis King!
Mantis King!

02:57.600 --> 02:58.740
( Slurping )

02:58.840 --> 03:00.840
What's he saying?

03:01.960 --> 03:04.980
So, do you, like,
have a translator or...

03:05.080 --> 03:06.020
( Slurping )

03:06.120 --> 03:07.420
Uh...
Uh...

03:07.520 --> 03:09.380
Blech!
Pardon my gum chewing.

03:09.480 --> 03:12.220
I just wanted to freshen up
before meeting you.

03:12.320 --> 03:13.860
Well, uh,
we're here about a wallet.

03:13.960 --> 03:16.280
Our friend Sureshot said
he was here partying last night

03:16.360 --> 03:18.360
and thinks
he left it behind.

03:17.600 --> 03:20.060
Sureshot.
Yes.

03:20.160 --> 03:21.500
Our lost and found box

03:21.600 --> 03:24.520
could contain any item
lost or found.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.880
Oh, cool.

03:26.360 --> 03:28.660
That's just like
what we have at the park.

03:28.760 --> 03:30.860
I guess we're all more alike
than we think.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.820
( Laughs )

03:31.920 --> 03:34.400
Yes.
I suppose we are.

03:36.520 --> 03:37.420
There it is.

03:37.520 --> 03:38.540
Sureshot was right.

03:38.640 --> 03:40.580
This was easy.

03:40.680 --> 03:42.380
Um...

03:42.480 --> 03:45.860
But, before outsiders can access
our lost and found,

03:45.960 --> 03:49.100
it is our custom for them
to join us at the royal feast.

03:49.200 --> 03:51.220
Oh, we wouldn't want
to go against your customs.

03:51.320 --> 03:52.940
Yeah,
we can have a little bite.

03:53.040 --> 03:54.980
Let the feast begin!

03:55.080 --> 03:56.700
( Bell dings )

03:56.800 --> 03:58.660
What?
No!

03:58.760 --> 04:00.220
You guys!
This food!

04:00.320 --> 04:01.580
We can't eat this!

04:01.680 --> 04:03.540
You choke down
whatever they feed us

04:03.640 --> 04:05.140
until we get that wallet.

04:05.240 --> 04:06.140
That's an order!

04:06.240 --> 04:08.440
Our host is watching.

04:09.440 --> 04:11.380
( Slurping )

04:11.480 --> 04:13.480
( All gulping )

04:15.680 --> 04:18.240
( Funky synth music plays )

04:59.440 --> 05:02.500
And now frozen bug butts.
Enjoy.

05:02.600 --> 05:04.100
( Stomach growling )
No more bug food.

05:04.200 --> 05:06.960
The wallet's right over there.
Let's just grab it and go.

05:07.920 --> 05:09.700
( Sighs ) Yeah,
I can't take much more.

05:09.800 --> 05:10.820
I'll go talk to the King.

05:10.920 --> 05:13.220
Ahh, Mordecai.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.620
Hey, uh, I just wanted to say
thanks for dinner ââ

05:15.720 --> 05:17.860
all the bugs and guts
and stuff ââ

05:17.960 --> 05:19.300
but we're in
a bit of a hurry.

05:19.400 --> 05:20.300
We were wondering...

05:20.400 --> 05:21.060
Ah, yes!

05:21.160 --> 05:24.180
Your beloved lost item
still waits to be found!

05:24.280 --> 05:25.740
Right.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.800
So if we could just snag it,
we'll be out of your hair.

05:27.880 --> 05:28.620
Nonsense!

05:28.720 --> 05:30.900
You absolutely
cannot leave here

05:31.000 --> 05:34.300
until you've tried
our galaxyârenowned dessert!

05:34.400 --> 05:36.460
Bring out
the vanilla ice cream!

05:36.560 --> 05:38.560
âOh, that's awesome!
âI love vanilla ice cream.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.120
âAll right, great!
âIt's refreshingly normal.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.180
â( Screams )
â( Coos )

05:44.280 --> 05:45.300
( Groans )

05:45.400 --> 05:48.860
Ooh!
You got the juiciest one!

05:48.960 --> 05:49.940
Jealous!

05:50.040 --> 05:50.780
( Chuckles )

05:50.880 --> 05:52.660
You know,
I'm so full already.

05:52.760 --> 05:53.860
Here.
You want it?

05:53.960 --> 05:55.620
( All gasp )

05:55.720 --> 05:57.540
Ooh!
Ooh!
Ooh!

05:57.640 --> 05:58.580
( Giggles )

05:58.680 --> 05:59.580
Ooh!

05:59.680 --> 06:00.660
Mordecai,

06:00.760 --> 06:03.900
IâIâI don't know
what to say!

06:04.000 --> 06:05.100
( Laughs )

06:05.200 --> 06:06.460
What?
( Screams )

06:06.560 --> 06:10.060
Mordecai,
you sly Earth creature you!

06:10.160 --> 06:11.820
What a grand ruse!

06:11.920 --> 06:13.940
"Lost your wallet" ââ
ha!

06:14.040 --> 06:17.980
Your intention was to propose
to my daughter this whole time!

06:18.080 --> 06:20.220
âWhat?!
â( Laughs ) No way!

06:20.320 --> 06:22.180
Is this for real?
âVery real!

06:22.280 --> 06:24.340
In manti culture,
offering food to another

06:24.440 --> 06:26.060
is an instant
marriage proposal.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.980
Well, the heart knows
what it wants, I guess.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.980
Not to be too hasty,
of course.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.140
We still await
the Princess's decision.

06:32.240 --> 06:35.100
We're manti,
not barbarians!

06:35.200 --> 06:36.860
Daughter, do you consent

06:36.960 --> 06:39.460
to this fine young man's
proposal?

06:39.560 --> 06:40.980
I do, father.

06:41.080 --> 06:42.340
I say yes!

06:42.440 --> 06:44.620
Kiss me, my love!
Kiss me!

06:44.720 --> 06:45.620
( Slurping )

06:45.720 --> 06:47.300
( Screams )
Get away!

06:47.400 --> 06:49.180
I mean, get a...

06:49.280 --> 06:52.260
wait for me to run
to the bathroom real quick.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.360
And, uh, I need my friends
to come with me.

06:53.960 --> 06:55.960
Nah, I'm good.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.060
I want to see
how this turns ââ Ow!

06:56.160 --> 06:57.300
Your Earth tradition

06:57.400 --> 07:00.140
of using the bathroom in groups
is baffling,

07:00.240 --> 07:01.700
but I'm not one to judge.

07:01.800 --> 07:02.860
( Chuckling ) Go! Go!

07:02.960 --> 07:04.500
Haâha, be back
in just one second.

07:04.600 --> 07:05.540
( Laughs )

07:05.640 --> 07:07.900
Return to me soon,
darling!

07:08.000 --> 07:09.340
What do I do?
What do I do?

07:09.440 --> 07:11.020
Hey,
look on the bright side ââ

07:11.120 --> 07:13.300
(Singsong voice)
somebody likes you.

07:13.400 --> 07:15.400
Just get married
and have some mantis babies.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.780
Except he won't live
to see them,

07:16.880 --> 07:19.200
because she will eat him
right after they get together.

07:19.280 --> 07:20.060
Ha!
Ha ha ha!

07:20.160 --> 07:21.700
( Laughs )
Wait, what?

07:21.800 --> 07:23.260
Yes.
In mantis culture,

07:23.360 --> 07:24.820
it is customary
for the bride

07:24.920 --> 07:26.840
to eat the groom
immediately after marriage.

07:26.920 --> 07:28.920
But then how is there a king
and a princess

07:28.680 --> 07:30.680
if the females
eat their mates?

07:29.920 --> 07:31.660
Look,
I don't know everything!

07:31.760 --> 07:33.540
( Groans )
I hate this planet.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.640
Let's just get the wallet
and get out of here.

07:35.440 --> 07:36.260
Hey, settle down.

07:36.360 --> 07:38.180
After they've been
so generous with us,

07:38.280 --> 07:40.100
you really want to run
like a coward?

07:40.200 --> 07:42.200
No.

07:40.520 --> 07:42.940
So just explain
the misunderstanding.

07:43.040 --> 07:43.940
They'll get it.

07:44.040 --> 07:45.060
Okay. Yeah.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.660
( Slurping )

07:47.760 --> 07:49.980
( Chuckles ) Yeah.
Have a seat.

07:50.080 --> 07:51.380
So...

07:51.480 --> 07:52.740
I'm really sorry
about this,

07:52.840 --> 07:55.380
but I've got this space mission
to accomplish.

07:55.480 --> 07:56.740
And, um...

07:56.840 --> 07:58.740
I have sort of
an "it's complicated" thing

07:58.840 --> 08:00.460
still happening
back on Earth...

08:00.560 --> 08:02.260
Oh, in mantis culture,

08:02.360 --> 08:05.420
they don't have
"it's complicated",
so she's confused.

08:05.520 --> 08:07.300
Yes.
I understand that, Recap.

08:07.400 --> 08:09.700
I'm just trying to tell her
I'm not going to marry her.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.020
( All Gasp )

08:11.120 --> 08:12.100
I mean...

08:12.200 --> 08:13.820
You're not gonna...

08:13.920 --> 08:14.940
I mean, it's just ââ

08:15.040 --> 08:16.340
( Sobs )

08:16.440 --> 08:18.380
( Growling, hissing )

08:18.480 --> 08:19.700
In mantis culture,

08:19.800 --> 08:21.800
when someone makes
a princess cry, they ââ

08:21.440 --> 08:23.540
Execute them!
There you go.

08:23.640 --> 08:26.140
( Hiss! )

08:26.240 --> 08:27.420
â( Screams )
âGet down!

08:27.520 --> 08:29.020
( All scream )

08:29.120 --> 08:31.120
They're trying to kill us!
What do we do?!

08:30.480 --> 08:31.940
Why don't you
just marry her?

08:32.040 --> 08:33.660
What, are you afraid
of commitment?

08:33.760 --> 08:35.700
What? No!
What are you talking about?

08:35.800 --> 08:37.100
Kidding.

08:37.200 --> 08:39.200
Hyah!
( Yells )

08:40.920 --> 08:41.780
Ow.

08:41.880 --> 08:44.140
( Rumbling )

08:44.240 --> 08:45.580
( Yells )

08:45.680 --> 08:47.940
I'll hold them off!
Run!

08:48.040 --> 08:49.460
( Dramatic music plays )

08:49.560 --> 08:51.460
We can't just leave her
out there!

08:51.560 --> 08:53.100
( Grunts )

08:53.200 --> 08:55.340
There's too many of them!
What do we do?

08:55.440 --> 08:56.940
Leave this to me.

08:57.040 --> 08:58.580
Yaaaa!

08:58.680 --> 09:00.900
Normally,
I'm actually super chill.

09:01.000 --> 09:03.580
But the King starts spraying
that "attack" pheromone

09:03.680 --> 09:04.860
and its like, "Whoo!

09:04.960 --> 09:06.820
Time to eat
someone's face!"

09:06.920 --> 09:08.700
( Wap! )
( Hisses )

09:08.800 --> 09:10.700
Big mistake, bro.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.940
I eat humans like you
for an afterâdinner snack!

09:14.040 --> 09:15.100
Wait!

09:15.200 --> 09:17.780
You mean humans like me?

09:17.880 --> 09:20.180
( Screams )
A robot!

09:20.280 --> 09:22.460
( All scream )

09:22.560 --> 09:24.780
( Laughs )
That's right!

09:24.880 --> 09:26.980
Bleagh!
Bleagh!

09:27.080 --> 09:29.080
Get the wallet!

09:32.680 --> 09:34.380
Got it!
Let's go!

09:34.480 --> 09:36.560
Get to the kart!

09:38.240 --> 09:41.660
There is no escape!
Guards! Seize them!

09:41.760 --> 09:43.700
Do we have to seize them?

09:43.800 --> 09:46.580
They have a robot,
and that's just, like, "Ew."

09:46.680 --> 09:49.540
( Hiss! )
Just shoot them!

09:49.640 --> 09:51.640
Fire! More! More!

09:53.720 --> 09:55.720
Keep shooting!

09:58.200 --> 09:59.420
Wait.
Less! Less!

09:59.520 --> 10:02.040
Actually,
maybe stop altogether.

10:06.800 --> 10:07.820
We got your wallet.

10:07.920 --> 10:09.540
What took you?
Waiter!

10:09.640 --> 10:11.460
I am still not a waiter.

10:11.560 --> 10:14.620
Well, whatever you are,
payment has arrived.

10:14.720 --> 10:15.700
About time.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.340
Force field removed.

10:17.440 --> 10:18.780
Finally.
( Chuckles )

10:18.880 --> 10:20.060
A little respect.

10:20.160 --> 10:21.660
Now let me just pay
the stupid bill

10:21.760 --> 10:23.500
and get out of ââ

10:23.600 --> 10:24.860
Huh.
Okay.

10:24.960 --> 10:26.380
New mission ââ
I need you guys

10:26.480 --> 10:28.900
to go to my bank
on the wasp planet
and take out some ââ

10:29.000 --> 10:29.940
( All groan )

10:30.040 --> 10:31.540
They're super chill.
I swear!

10:31.640 --> 10:33.540
( Muffled )
Aw, come on!

10:47.880 --> 10:50.280
( Both chuckle )
