<i>and were able to deliver that.</i>

10:29.628 --> 10:31.464
<i>The application in this tattoo</i>

10:35.176 --> 10:36.135

10:37.887 --> 10:41.182
<i>It's tiny, but the details</i>
<i>are big enough</i>

10:41.265 --> 10:42.099

11:39.949 --> 11:42.535
Getting away from the mantis

11:59.218 --> 12:00.261

12:19.447 --> 12:21.615

just be solid.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.075
- Steve's is more of, like,
a technical drawing.

12:23.159 --> 12:25.661
<i>- It's like a science drawing.</i>
<i>- A science drawing</i>

12:25.744 --> 12:26.745

12:26.829 --> 12:27.830
{\an3}- I'm torn between
Steve and DJ.

12:27.913 --> 12:31.333
- I mean, Anthony put in
multiple textures.

12:31.417 --> 12:34.753
<i>Those translucent wings give</i>
<i>that really soft drop shadow,</i>

12:34.837 --> 12:36.755
<i>plus the connection</i>
<i>of every single leg</i>

12:36.839 --> 12:39.508
is really well detailed.
I'm leaning towards Anthony.

12:39.592 --> 12:41.844
- Anthony's has
that beautiful silhouette,

12:41.927 --> 12:44.680
and it's really soft.
I'm gonna go with Anthony.

12:44.763 --> 12:46.724

the winner

12:46.807 --> 12:49.018

23:42.295 --> 23:44.297
{\an1}And the whole thing's
completely lined.

23:44.381 --> 23:47.175
{\an8}My love for tattooing
cost me so much.

23:47.259 --> 23:49.511
{\an8}It's cost me friendships.
It's cost me relationships.

23:49.594 --> 23:50.762
<i>There was hardship</i>
<i>with my family for times,</i>

23:50.846 --> 23:53.223
where they thought
I was throwing away my life.

23:53.306 --> 23:55.016
<i>I wasn't willing to give up,</i>

23:55.100 --> 23:57.018
<i>and 15 years later,</i>
<i>I'm standing on the top</i>

23:57.102 --> 23:58.937
of this industry doing
really, really well.

23:59.020 --> 24:00.355
- You learned something new!

24:00.438 --> 24:01.648
- Depth, value.
Everything's there.

24:01.731 --> 24:02.440
- Hey, maybe they could
show this guy

24:02.524 --> 24:03.650
how to draw a mandala next.

24:03.733 --> 24:05.944
- When was the last time
you drew a mandala?

24:06.027 --> 24:07.195
'Cause I'm sure you have
some little program

24:07.279 --> 24:08.905
that does it for you.
- Oh, here we go.

24:08.989 --> 24:09.990
How'd you make that design?
- That's called

24:10.073 --> 24:12.534
a "printed piece of paper."
- Yeah.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.661
{\an8}Josh's tattoo is good
for a two-hour tattoo,

24:14.744 --> 24:17.038
<i>but for technical application,</i>
<i>sorry, Josh.</i>

24:17.122 --> 24:19.207
<i>Mine kills it.</i>

24:19.291 --> 24:23.670
- Three hours left.
Three hours to go, guys.

24:23.753 --> 24:26.298
- As soon as we get a skull
pick, you guys are done,

24:26.381 --> 24:28.175
because I'm firing
at both your teams

24:28.258 --> 24:29.801
and knocking the legs off of

24:29.885 --> 24:31.219
one of these top artists
on your team.

24:31.303 --> 24:33.805
- If you're coming at my team,
you got to come hard, bro,

24:33.889 --> 24:36.892
'cause they're standing
strong right now.

24:36.975 --> 24:38.393
{\an1}- It comes down to this:
application day,

24:38.476 --> 24:40.937
{\an1}I'm looking at chewed-up skin,
not solid black,

24:41.021 --> 24:42.814
{\an1}not smooth shading.
If I see that,

24:42.898 --> 24:44.191
{\an1}those people are gonna be
the ones in trouble.

24:47.777 --> 24:49.237
- How you doing, Frank?

24:49.321 --> 24:51.198
- She's starting to, like,
pull and split from, like,

24:51.281 --> 24:51.489
{\an8}rubbing it, wiping stuff.

24:53.825 --> 24:56.328
- Yeah.
- Oh...

24:56.411 --> 24:59.039
- I'm trying so hard to do
such a clean tattoo

24:59.122 --> 25:01.833
that I overlooked how much
that skin could take,

25:01.917 --> 25:03.752
<i>and I overworked it.</i>

25:06.171 --> 25:08.089
- [clicks tongue]

25:08.173 --> 25:09.424
{\an8}<i>- There's trauma in my tattoo,</i>

25:09.507 --> 25:12.093
and this is the one day
where that is the worst thing

25:12.177 --> 25:14.012
you could ever do.

25:14.095 --> 25:15.597
<i>I can only hope that</i>
<i>somebody else [bleep] up</i>

25:15.680 --> 25:16.640
more than I did.

25:16.723 --> 25:17.682
{\an3}- [bleep].

25:17.766 --> 25:21.561
- Final hour.
One hour remaining.

25:21.645 --> 25:23.772
{\an1}- Just a little choppier
in that part.

25:23.855 --> 25:25.482
{\an1}You gotta--
you gotta smooth it out.

25:27.484 --> 25:29.611
{\an7}- Okay, but you still can
have smooth shading.

25:29.694 --> 25:30.779
{\an8}- I got the triple moon
goddess,

25:30.862 --> 25:32.197
{\an8}and I'm not happy about it.

25:32.280 --> 25:34.449
<i>Triple moon goddess</i>
<i>is three lady faces:</i>

25:34.532 --> 25:36.952
a young one, a middle-aged one,
and an elderly one.

25:37.035 --> 25:38.995
{\an1}Just tell me it looks
like [bleep] right now.

25:39.079 --> 25:40.872
{\an3}- Come on. Keep working, bro.
You ain't got time.

25:40.956 --> 25:43.625
- And I'm freaking out.
I hate rushing tattoos.

25:43.708 --> 25:44.960
<i>I was just at the bottom.</i>

25:45.043 --> 25:46.002
<i>I don't want to go</i>
<i>to the bottom again,</i>

25:46.086 --> 25:47.754
but this tattoo
might send me there.

25:52.342 --> 25:54.970
- I'm gonna be nitpicky, bro.
- I want you to be nitpicky.

25:55.053 --> 25:56.221
- You got to do this.

25:56.304 --> 25:59.057
{\an8}- I am the only one on my team
that hasn't won

25:59.140 --> 26:00.392
{\an8}tattoo of the day yet.

26:00.475 --> 26:02.978
<i>I definitely need</i>
<i>to win it right now.</i>

26:03.061 --> 26:04.396
{\an3}- Don't forget what
you're here for.

26:04.479 --> 26:05.522
- I'm here for my people
of Puerto Rico.

26:05.605 --> 26:08.108
You know, I love them
with all my heart.

26:08.191 --> 26:09.025
Puts tears in my eyes
every time I mention them,

26:09.109 --> 26:10.193
and you know it.

26:10.277 --> 26:12.779
{\an8}I'm representing my country.

26:12.862 --> 26:14.656
<i>Today, I want</i>
<i>to give something</i>

26:14.739 --> 26:16.908
<i>to my people of Puerto Rico</i>
<i>to be proud of.</i>

26:16.992 --> 26:19.286
I want to bring hope
back to them,

26:19.369 --> 26:21.705
<i>and now is my chance.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:22.998
{\an8}It's closer than ever.

26:23.081 --> 26:25.583
{\an8}I want to win mejor tatuaje
del día for Puerto Rico.

26:29.129 --> 26:32.090
Five, four,

26:32.173 --> 26:35.635
three, two...one.

26:35.719 --> 26:36.928
That's it.
Machines down.

26:37.012 --> 26:40.015
Time is up.
No more ink.

26:40.098 --> 26:42.225
- You stayed so still.
I'm amazed.

26:42.309 --> 26:44.519
- Go check it out.

26:44.602 --> 26:45.687
{\an8}- Thank you.

26:45.770 --> 26:47.605
{\an1}You sat well
and it worked out.

26:47.689 --> 26:50.358
- Wow, fantastic.
- Dude.

26:50.442 --> 26:51.693
Thank you so much.
- Killed it. Awesome.

26:51.776 --> 26:53.945
- Oh, there she is.

26:54.029 --> 26:55.947
I'm teaching you well
on the circle, boy.

26:56.031 --> 26:57.574
{\an1}- You know that I've been
learning from you, man,

26:57.657 --> 26:59.200
the secret.

26:59.284 --> 27:01.369
{\an1}- Jeremy, you don't have
to pack up yet.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.203
{\an1}You can wait
until after elimination.

27:02.287 --> 27:04.247
It's not over yet.

27:04.331 --> 27:05.498
- Who let you out of daycare?

27:05.582 --> 27:06.833
- That's all you got?

27:06.916 --> 27:08.168
- I think Daniel needs
an adult.

27:10.962 --> 27:12.172
- It looked like hamburger.

27:12.255 --> 27:13.673
- You had three chances
to make a good face,

27:13.757 --> 27:14.966
and you [bleep] up
each one of them.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.261
- There's no explanation.
I [bleep] fell on my face.

27:18.345 --> 27:21.222
- You missed today big time.
- I'm not done.

27:21.306 --> 27:23.516
- This is poor execution,
and it really shows.

27:25.643 --> 27:29.064
<i>[dramatic music]</i>

27:29.147 --> 27:30.482
- My skull pick was
the hardest idea in the room.

27:30.565 --> 27:34.027
- No, it's not!
- Hell, no. No!

27:34.110 --> 27:35.862
{\an1}- Like, what the hell
is a triple moon goddess?

27:35.945 --> 27:37.906
- Drawing a face is,
like, the first thing

27:37.989 --> 27:40.325
you learn how to do.
- Maybe the first thing

27:40.408 --> 27:41.743
you learned,
but I don't do lady faces.

27:41.826 --> 27:43.578
{\an1}- The mouth on both
of those women looked like

27:43.661 --> 27:45.747
{\an3}what a fish does
when it opens its mouth.

27:45.830 --> 27:47.957
{\an1}How the [bleep] do you
not know how a lip works?

27:48.041 --> 27:50.001
- What about the trauma
all over yours, dude?

27:50.085 --> 27:51.211
It looked
like hamburger.

27:51.294 --> 27:52.545
{\an1}- I'm admitting there's
trauma in the place

27:52.629 --> 27:54.422
{\an1}that I told everybody
there was some trauma in.

27:54.506 --> 27:55.715
- Daniel's sword was
wobbled as [bleep].

27:55.799 --> 27:57.675
Did you see that?
- You had three chances

27:57.759 --> 27:59.928
to make a good face, and you
[bleep] up each one of them.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.846
- The lines were straight.
They weren't traumatized.

28:01.930 --> 28:03.264
Yeah.
- My line work was way better

28:03.348 --> 28:04.432
than your line work.
- My line work was straight

28:04.516 --> 28:05.725
as [bleep].
Talk all the [bleep] you want.

28:05.809 --> 28:07.769
My design is solid, dude.
It's readable.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.104
- You could read the
chin's [bleep] up.

28:09.187 --> 28:10.480
- Yeah.

to perfectly apply

28:25.870 --> 28:26.746
a sternum tattoo.

28:26.830 --> 28:28.748
Team Steve, you're up.
Jeremy.

28:32.001 --> 28:35.422
- Your technical application
is nice for the area.

28:35.505 --> 28:36.965
<i>You showed some</i>
<i>nice areas of line work,</i>

28:37.048 --> 28:38.633
<i>and you showed some</i>
<i>nice areas of shading.</i>

<i>That being said,</i>
<i>look at the lips</i>

<i>Look at the shading</i>
<i>of the nose and the cheeks.</i>

28:45.014 --> 28:46.141
<i>They're not finished.</i>

28:46.224 --> 28:47.725
<i>The center</i>
<i>is so charried out,</i>

28:47.809 --> 28:49.894
<i>it looks like you ran out of</i>
<i>time for your profiles.</i>

28:49.978 --> 28:52.480
- I did it on purpose to make
the middle stand out more.

28:52.564 --> 28:53.565
- It doesn't look complete.

28:59.904 --> 29:01.823

this tattoo looks very smooth.

29:01.906 --> 29:03.658
<i>The drawing of the cat</i>
<i>is very cool.</i>

29:03.741 --> 29:05.910
<i>It's very distinct.</i>
<i>It has an Egyptian look to it.</i>

29:05.994 --> 29:07.370
- The outline on these wings,

29:07.454 --> 29:08.705
<i>the way you shaded</i>
<i>these wings--</i>

29:08.788 --> 29:10.123
<i>it's just nice</i>
<i>and clean.</i>

29:10.206 --> 29:11.332
<i>The style of shading</i>
<i>that you use here</i>

29:11.416 --> 29:14.586
<i>really works well</i>
<i>with darker skin.</i>

29:14.669 --> 29:16.629
<i>This is just</i>
<i>the straightforward tattoo</i>

29:16.713 --> 29:18.673
done just right.
- Yeah.

29:18.756 --> 29:23.970
- Team Anthony, you're up.
Jason.

29:24.053 --> 29:26.181
- Overall, I really like
the look of this tattoo.

29:26.264 --> 29:28.183
<i>Technically speaking,</i>
<i>you have a bold outline,</i>

29:28.266 --> 29:31.186
<i>you have solid black,</i>
<i>and then you have the pepper</i>

29:31.269 --> 29:32.854
<i>that comes out</i>
<i>pretty equidistant</i>

29:32.937 --> 29:34.772
<i>all along each row</i>
<i>of the wings.</i>

29:34.856 --> 29:36.608
<i>There's a few spots</i>
<i>where we can see the red</i>

29:36.691 --> 29:38.526
<i>is not 100% saturated,</i>

29:38.610 --> 29:39.736
<i>but it has a really</i>
<i>tough look,</i>

29:39.819 --> 29:41.696
and it also is very legible
from a distance.

29:43.239 --> 29:46.868
- Juan.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.953
It's a really impressive
piece of work.

29:49.037 --> 29:51.831
<i>You have so much texture and</i>
<i>detail in the heart itself.</i>

29:51.915 --> 29:54.584
<i>The clouds are</i>
<i>very simplistic.</i>

29:54.667 --> 29:56.544
<i>I like how that juxtaposition</i>
<i>looks old-school,</i>

29:56.628 --> 30:00.131
but is unique at the same time.

30:00.215 --> 30:01.925
<i>- It's bold, it's heavy,</i>
<i>and it looks like it belongs</i>

30:02.008 --> 30:05.637
<i>exactly where it sits,</i>
<i>and it has a density</i>

30:05.720 --> 30:07.722
and a weight to it.
You could hold this thing.

30:07.805 --> 30:09.599
You could punch this thing.
It's bulletproof.

30:11.392 --> 30:14.062
- Daniel.

30:15.730 --> 30:16.898
{\an8}- The tattoo has
a beautiful look to it.

30:16.981 --> 30:20.151
{\an8}<i>You do such nice detail</i>
<i>with the skull,</i>

30:20.235 --> 30:21.653
{\an8}<i>but where you have a problem</i>

30:21.736 --> 30:24.072
{\an8}<i>is the alignment</i>
<i>of the design itself.</i>

30:24.155 --> 30:26.616
{\an8}- Obviously,
her chest is not symmetrical,

30:26.699 --> 30:29.702
{\an8}<i>but we agreed to make</i>
<i>the tattoo symmetrical.</i>

30:29.786 --> 30:32.080
- It is a little bit
questionable that the dagger

30:32.163 --> 30:34.832
<i>that goes into the top</i>
<i>of the skull goes pretty thin,</i>

30:34.916 --> 30:37.710
<i>and if it was to continue at</i>
<i>the same rate that it's going,</i>

30:37.794 --> 30:38.670
<i>there's no way the dagger</i>
<i>would make it all the way,</i>

30:38.753 --> 30:41.089
<i>as far down low as it does.</i>

30:41.172 --> 30:42.549
The blade length
is a little bit off.

30:45.343 --> 30:46.511
- Team DJ, you're up.
Deanna.

30:49.806 --> 30:52.559
- This is a tough,
dark, evil tattoo.

30:52.642 --> 30:53.810
<i>The dark shading is very cool,</i>

30:53.893 --> 30:56.104
<i>and you do get a lot of</i>
<i>nice textures in there,</i>

30:56.187 --> 30:58.690
but there needs to be a little
bit more highlight areas

30:58.773 --> 31:01.568
<i>in some parts of the skull,</i>
<i>because it just gets so dark</i>

31:01.651 --> 31:03.111
<i>that you lose what shapes</i>
<i>are going on there.</i>

31:03.194 --> 31:06.447
- Look at the skull and how
gnarled and how textured

31:06.531 --> 31:09.242
<i>and how great you do there,</i>
<i>and then you get to the horns,</i>

31:09.325 --> 31:11.327
<i>and it's just</i>
<i>two flat silhouettes.</i>

31:11.411 --> 31:12.870
<i>Make them interesting.</i>

31:12.954 --> 31:14.622
If you're gonna be able
to have this much freedom

31:14.706 --> 31:16.916
and be this loose, you've got
to follow all the way through.

31:18.876 --> 31:19.961
- Josh.

31:22.255 --> 31:24.591
- Technically, you have
a lot of really great shading.

31:24.674 --> 31:25.967
<i>You do have very consistent,</i>
<i>clean line work.</i>

31:26.050 --> 31:28.678
<i>The layers you have</i>
<i>of the petals</i>

31:28.761 --> 31:30.763
<i>where you have the shadow</i>
<i>cast from one layer</i>

31:30.847 --> 31:32.682
<i>to the next</i>
<i>gives this thing the depth,</i>

31:32.765 --> 31:34.767
and it just--it comes out
looking really beautiful.

31:34.851 --> 31:36.644
- Thank you very much.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.479
- Frank.

31:40.398 --> 31:42.984
- Design-wise, I think you fall
pretty short on this thing.

31:43.067 --> 31:44.652
<i>You went really simple.</i>

31:44.736 --> 31:47.155
It just has a goofy
little cartoony look.

<i>these red outlines</i>

31:49.741 --> 31:51.659

<i>that go up the trunk--</i>

31:51.743 --> 31:53.494
<i>all super inconsistent.</i>

31:53.578 --> 31:55.663
<i>The shapes of the headdress</i>
<i>and the line weights</i>

31:55.747 --> 31:58.583

31:58.666 --> 31:59.834

32:08.468 --> 32:09.719
from the drawing

32:14.098 --> 32:15.808
- All right, guys.
It is time to determine

32:15.892 --> 32:19.020
who had the best
tattoo of the day.

32:19.103 --> 32:22.190
- For technical application,
just how simple and how smooth

32:22.273 --> 32:23.775
Roly's is, I mean, there's not
a lot of a variance in there.

32:23.858 --> 32:25.151
<i>I think it's pretty clean.</i>

32:25.234 --> 32:28.363
- I look at that, and then
I look at Juan coming in

32:28.446 --> 32:30.114
and doing pretty much
the same technical application

32:30.198 --> 32:34.869
with a lot more in it.
I'm going for Juan.

32:34.952 --> 32:36.746
- My vote's for Roly.

32:36.829 --> 32:37.955
{\an8}<i>- It's hard to argue</i>
<i>with that heart.</i>

32:38.039 --> 32:39.540
{\an8}- There's a lot in there
and it's bulletproof.

32:39.624 --> 32:42.377
- My vote is for Juan.

32:42.460 --> 32:44.712
The judges have decided
the best tattoo of the day

32:44.796 --> 32:47.173
goes to Juan.
- What?

32:47.256 --> 32:48.508
I can't believe this.
- First win, Juan.

32:48.591 --> 32:50.176
- How does it feel?
- It feels amazing.

32:50.259 --> 32:51.886
Like a million bucks, man.

- All right, remember, coaches,

32:53.471 --> 32:56.182
you must deliberate

32:56.265 --> 32:57.225

{\an1}I had a falling out

She told me that

Right now, Team Anthony

is challenged as a design

35:35.466 --> 35:36.926

35:37.009 --> 35:38.177
<i>- In the center, that girl's</i>

{\an3}- He might be good
at what he does at home,

{\an3}but to come here

35:47.979 --> 35:48.980
you have to be able to draw.

themselves

35:50.314 --> 35:51.232

This is just as dumbed-down

36:00.449 --> 36:02.201

- Well, I'm gonna be hard

36:05.621 --> 36:07.999
on Daniel, because
the technical application

36:08.082 --> 36:09.792
<i>on his tattoo is very nice,</i>

36:09.876 --> 36:12.086
<i>but the setup of</i>
<i>the tattoo is way off.</i>

36:12.170 --> 36:13.588
<i>- It's just very unappealing.</i>

36:13.671 --> 36:15.131
The mixing of styles
the way he did it--

36:15.214 --> 36:18.009
<i>it's just</i>
<i>nothing goes together.</i>

36:18.092 --> 36:19.594
Let's talk about Deanna.

36:19.677 --> 36:22.972
The fact that she went so dark,
a lot of the detail gets lost.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.307
<i>- Deanna's tattoo</i>
<i>is illegible,</i>

36:24.390 --> 36:26.767
<i>'cause you don't know</i>
<i>that it's a dragon,</i>

36:26.851 --> 36:28.227
<i>and there's a big</i>
<i>contrast miss.</i>

36:28.311 --> 36:30.646
That's actually
a technical problem.

36:30.730 --> 36:32.273
- Yeah, that's a...
- Well, the coaches are

36:32.356 --> 36:34.650
now deliberating,
and they have the job

36:34.734 --> 36:37.778
of putting one of these artists
up for elimination,

36:37.862 --> 36:38.988
so that should be
pretty interesting

36:39.071 --> 36:39.363
to see who they choose.

36:41.908 --> 36:44.952
- I'm going down there.
That's gonna happen.

36:45.036 --> 36:46.662
For what happened,
I totally own that [bleep].

36:46.746 --> 36:48.956
I've not been down there once,
but I don't think it's the end.

36:49.040 --> 36:50.499
We're going down there

36:50.583 --> 36:53.836
That's what we [bleep] do.
- Aside from Roly and Juan,

36:53.920 --> 36:55.338
I think that anybody could be
going down to the bottom.

37:01.510 --> 37:04.639
- All right, coaches,
which artist are you sending

37:04.722 --> 37:05.848
down for elimination?

37:09.060 --> 37:11.020
- The coaches have decided...

37:11.103 --> 37:14.357
to send Frank down
for elimination.

37:14.440 --> 37:17.818
- All right.
We'll see Frank...

37:17.902 --> 37:19.654
Jeremy...

37:19.737 --> 37:23.407
and Deanna.

37:23.491 --> 37:24.450
And we'll see the coaches
downstairs as well.

37:28.955 --> 37:30.665
- Let's do it.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.250
- You got this.
- Frankie, play hardball.

37:39.590 --> 37:42.426
- Today, you had to show
perfect application

37:42.510 --> 37:44.845
tattooing a sternum.

37:44.929 --> 37:47.181
Based on your work,
one of you

37:47.264 --> 37:48.683
will be packing your machines.

37:48.766 --> 37:49.725
Let's hear from the coaches.

37:49.809 --> 37:52.895
Guys, why did you
vote Frank to the bottom?

37:52.979 --> 37:54.355
- We say it all the time,

37:54.438 --> 37:57.358
and I think with this challenge
in particular, it hit home:

37:57.441 --> 37:58.317
technical application.

37:58.401 --> 38:00.695
- So let's get
into Frank first.

38:00.778 --> 38:03.239
- Well, Frank, this was one of
the most challenged ones

38:03.322 --> 38:05.533
in the room.
Anywhere you had to go over

38:05.616 --> 38:08.077
this tattoo more than once,
it really shows.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.954
- If you would have taken
an approach

38:10.037 --> 38:11.580
more towards
your black and gray style,

38:11.664 --> 38:13.249
I don't think you'd
be down here today.

38:13.332 --> 38:14.875
- Technical application day.

38:14.959 --> 38:17.336
That's what we were doing,
and I [bleep] up, so...

38:17.420 --> 38:20.589
- I did not vote for Frank.
- Really?

38:20.673 --> 38:23.551
{\an3}- I looked deeper into
the future of this competition,

38:23.634 --> 38:25.511
{\an3}and I voted Jeremy
to the bottom.

38:25.594 --> 38:28.389
- If it was, like, design day,
he'd be going home.

38:28.472 --> 38:30.850
- I met the challenge you guys
asked for:

38:30.933 --> 38:32.351
technical application.
It's a clean, solid tattoo.

38:32.435 --> 38:35.646
<i>- This attempt</i>
<i>to put these weird lines</i>

38:35.730 --> 38:36.564
<i>in the girl's face</i>
<i>on the right--</i>

38:36.647 --> 38:38.774
<i>it looks like poor execution.</i>

38:38.858 --> 38:40.234
It looks like a mistake.

38:40.317 --> 38:43.154
{\an1}- I just really wish I would've
executed the drawing better.

38:43.237 --> 38:45.156
I know I can draw
better than that.

38:45.239 --> 38:46.449
It was a difficult ask

38:46.532 --> 38:48.159
of three women's faces
on a chest.

38:48.242 --> 38:49.368
Did it get a little away
from him?

38:49.452 --> 38:51.746
Absolutely.
But on application day,

38:51.829 --> 38:53.080
he has the best application.

38:53.164 --> 38:55.875
- Let's move on to Deanna.

38:55.958 --> 38:58.836
- My biggest problem with
this tattoo is illegibility.

38:58.919 --> 39:00.212
<i>- I was trying to do texture,</i>

39:00.296 --> 39:01.338
and I also want to show
that I can do other stuff

39:01.422 --> 39:03.466
and I can
go outside my comfort zone.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.344
- You're giving this thing--
this look--that all feels

39:06.427 --> 39:08.846
the same within itself.
With this few of you

39:08.929 --> 39:10.473
in the house,
whoever shines brighter

39:10.556 --> 39:12.183
than the other--
that one's gonna stay,

39:12.266 --> 39:13.726
and the other one's
gonna go home.

39:13.809 --> 39:17.355
- Judges, it is time
to determine who's going home.

39:17.438 --> 39:19.607
- This is the one day
where I said

39:19.690 --> 39:21.525
whoever goes home's gonna
be a technical issue.

39:26.155 --> 39:29.700
- And Frank, you're the one
with the most technical issues.

39:29.784 --> 39:31.368
- Chris?
- Frank.

39:31.452 --> 39:32.828
- The judges have decided.

39:32.912 --> 39:37.750
Frank, you do not have what
it takes to be Ink Master.

39:37.833 --> 39:39.126
- I will tell you this:

39:39.210 --> 39:41.128
none of us three want
to send you home.

39:41.212 --> 39:43.214
Keep your head up, be strong,

39:43.297 --> 39:45.883
and we really respect you.
I love your [bleep].

39:45.966 --> 39:47.593
- Please pack your machines
and close shop.

39:56.018 --> 39:58.479
<i>- What makes me most emotional</i>
<i>about this elimination</i>

39:58.562 --> 40:00.940
is the fact
that I dropped the ball,

40:01.023 --> 40:04.235
and I feel, like,
mad at myself for that.

40:04.318 --> 40:05.569
<i>This competition</i>
<i>was important for me</i>

40:05.653 --> 40:08.656
because I wanted to see
where I stacked up,

40:08.739 --> 40:10.741
<i>and it sucks that</i>
<i>it's had to stop here,</i>

40:10.825 --> 40:13.077
because I don't feel like
I got to show everybody

40:13.160 --> 40:14.537
what I'm capable of.

40:20.543 --> 40:23.462
<i>announcer: On the next episode</i>
<i>of "Ink Master"...</i>

40:23.546 --> 40:25.714
{\an1}- Why am I not respected
in this house?

40:25.798 --> 40:27.216
- You're not giving me
a [bleep] fight right now.

40:27.299 --> 40:28.843
- We are gonna [bleep]
chew these skulls up

40:28.926 --> 40:30.803
<i>and spit them right back</i>
<i>at you.</i>

40:30.886 --> 40:32.346
- To come here
and to risk it all,

40:32.429 --> 40:33.681
that's what I'm doing for him.

40:33.764 --> 40:35.141
- I'd like to see you go home.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.433
- He wants to do everything
or he wants to do nothing,

40:36.517 --> 40:37.893
<i>and there's no middle ground.</i>

40:37.977 --> 40:39.353
- You're not trying to [bleep]
get tattoo of the day,

40:39.436 --> 40:41.355
trying to win it,
trying to be Ink Master.

40:41.438 --> 40:42.857
That's just it.
- You win like bitches,

40:42.940 --> 40:44.442
you lose like bitches.

40:44.525 --> 40:47.153
- You have the technical
ability to be a lot better.

40:47.236 --> 40:49.321
- The key ingredient that's
missing is experience.

40:49.405 --> 40:50.364
- Where's his fundamentals?

40:50.447 --> 40:53.325
- That's some remedial-ass
[bleep]!
