00:01.034 --> 00:03.594
There's nothing about any of
these cars here that's ordinary.

00:03.670 --> 00:07.071
They'll take a hit that would send a
production-line model directly to car heaven.

00:08.908 --> 00:12.503
One of the security team
may be a plant, sent in on a hitjob.

00:16.282 --> 00:20.685
I have the assassination team on the
scanners. Those cars are heavily armored.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.688
Five at once could be a problem.

00:42.709 --> 00:47.806
Knight Rider, a shadowy flight
into the dangerous world of a man...

00:47.881 --> 00:49.906
who does not exist.

00:59.959 --> 01:01.950
Michael Knight, a young loner...

01:02.028 --> 01:04.553
on a crusade to champion
the cause of the innocent,

01:04.631 --> 01:07.657
the helpless,
the powerless,

01:07.734 --> 01:11.295
in a world of criminals
who operate above the law.

01:55.915 --> 01:59.908
Yesterday's bombing was the latest
in a string of deadly terrorist assaults...

01:59.986 --> 02:02.250
that have left scores of casualties
throughout the world.

02:02.322 --> 02:05.587
One can only wonder what effect
this will have on the summit conference,

02:05.658 --> 02:08.286
organized by the Foundation's
Devon Miles,

02:08.360 --> 02:11.159
which is scheduled to convene
five days from now.

02:11.231 --> 02:13.791
At that time, Mr. Miles hopes
to negotiate a treaty...

02:13.867 --> 02:17.496
among three of the nations currently
harboring the terrorist brigades.

02:17.570 --> 02:20.232
Hello. Yes, we're
looking forward to the meeting.

02:20.306 --> 02:23.207
Yes, I'm watching it now.

02:23.276 --> 02:26.541
Absolutely terrible news.

02:26.613 --> 02:31.778
It means that we will have to approach the
mission with a renewed sense of urgency.

02:31.851 --> 02:35.309
Oh, don't worry. You'll soon see
what steps I intend to take.

02:35.388 --> 02:38.949
The important thing is that
words, not guns, should be employed now.

02:39.025 --> 02:42.483
We don't need any more violence, and I'm
sorry, we have no more statements to make.

02:42.562 --> 02:44.086
Thank you so much.

02:46.533 --> 02:49.001
Michael, what is this?

02:52.138 --> 02:54.129
Seaweed.

02:54.207 --> 02:56.266
What is seaweed doing
under KITT's hood?

02:56.342 --> 02:59.038
Oh, yeah. Well.
I can explain that.

02:59.112 --> 03:02.878
- Perhaps you shouldn't, Michael.
- Don't tell me...

03:02.949 --> 03:05.247
Remember all those jewel robberies
down at the marina?

03:05.318 --> 03:08.219
Well, it turns out
the two thieves are scuba divers.

03:08.288 --> 03:10.483
Anyway, KITT and I are
on the pier, and these two guys,

03:10.557 --> 03:12.525
they jump right in the ocean,
so naturally...

03:12.592 --> 03:15.026
Michael. Devon! What's the good word?

03:15.094 --> 03:17.187
I wish I had one.
I'm sorry to disturb you both.

03:17.263 --> 03:19.288
I'm afraid I need you to drive me
somewhere immediately.

03:19.365 --> 03:21.765
All right. KITT should be
ready in a couple seconds.

03:21.834 --> 03:24.735
No. We won't need KITT.
I've arranged for another car.

03:24.804 --> 03:27.534
Come along. We must move quickly.
Time is of the essence.

03:27.607 --> 03:31.543
- Good-bye, Bonnie.
- Well, I'll catch you guys later, huh?

03:31.611 --> 03:33.602
Here.

03:38.818 --> 03:40.911
Why do you suppose
they excluded me, Bonnie?

03:40.987 --> 03:42.978
I don't know, KITT.

03:44.357 --> 03:46.723
But don't take it personally.
I won't.

03:46.793 --> 03:48.784
You know I can't
take anything personally.

03:57.303 --> 03:59.737
I've always known you were
a class act, Devon,

03:59.806 --> 04:03.742
but, uh, is it really necessary for me
to chauffeur you around like this?

04:03.810 --> 04:06.711
In this case,
absolutely essential, Michael.

04:06.779 --> 04:09.612
In fact, you're virtually indispensable.

04:38.544 --> 04:40.535
Looks like we got
some company.

04:40.613 --> 04:42.911
Any ideas?

04:42.982 --> 04:45.712
Yes. Lose it. Anyway you can.

04:45.785 --> 04:48.049
Okay, Devon, but
this sure isn't KITT.

05:48.948 --> 05:51.075
We're like a tank
against a fighter plane here.

05:51.150 --> 05:55.086
What am I supposed to do?
Be skillful, Michael. Be skillful.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.618
Well, Mr. Redmond. What is
your opinion of my opinion now?

06:33.693 --> 06:35.888
Well, you were not kiddin', Mr. Miles.

06:35.962 --> 06:39.090
This boy can hold his own with
the best. He's gonna do just fine.

06:39.165 --> 06:42.259
Do what fine? Would somebody
like to tell me what's goin' on here?

06:42.335 --> 06:45.099
All in good time, dear boy.
All in good time.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.607
Next week, the leaders
of three rather unstable...

06:50.676 --> 06:52.940
Third World nations
will come together here...

06:53.012 --> 06:56.072
in order to sign
an anti-terrorism treaty.

06:57.750 --> 07:02.187
If this treaty is signed, it could put
international terrorism out ofbusiness.

07:02.255 --> 07:05.122
Devon, I still don't see
the problem.

07:07.360 --> 07:12.957
Because, Michael, one of the security
team may be a plant sent in on a hit job.

07:13.032 --> 07:15.967
Or at the very least, to make sure
that the treaty isn't signed.

07:16.035 --> 07:19.004
And I'm supposed
to find the hit man. Right?

07:19.071 --> 07:23.565
Exactly. Now, in order to polish
their skills for their assignment,

07:23.643 --> 07:28.103
the members of the security team will attend a
special session at Mr. Redmond's Victory Academy.

07:28.181 --> 07:30.877
He normally handles
groups of up to 100.

07:30.950 --> 07:33.441
He teaches tactical and evasive
driving techniques...

07:33.519 --> 07:35.851
...along with advanced,
hand-to-hand combat,

07:35.922 --> 07:37.856
and weapons-oriented
bodyguard techniques.

07:37.924 --> 07:41.826
I'm familiar with the place. Now, do
you have any more information for me...

07:41.894 --> 07:45.125
beyond the fact that one of
these guys just might be a ringer?

07:45.198 --> 07:49.134
Very little, I'm afraid. Here are their dossiers,
but there isn't much to be learned from them.

07:49.202 --> 07:54.139
So, with no leads, I got less than one week
to catch a bad guy who may not even exist.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.141
Doesn't sound to me
to be too simple.

07:56.209 --> 07:58.837
On the contrary, Michael.
It seems perfectly simple to me.

07:58.911 --> 08:02.039
Devon, let's say
there is a bad guy.

08:02.114 --> 08:04.514
And he overreacts
and decides to waste me.

08:04.584 --> 08:09.681
Oh, that would be a most serious
and unfortunate resolution, Michael.

08:09.755 --> 08:12.553
But you're quite right.
It would solve our problem.

08:35.248 --> 08:40.515
What we're to do... do our best to make
any possible suspect blow his or her cover.

08:40.586 --> 08:43.111
I must say, it's an extremely
clever plan, though.

08:43.188 --> 08:45.180
Must've been Mr. Miles's idea.

08:45.258 --> 08:49.592
- Why would you think that?
- Because it entails a rather objective and sophisticated insight...

08:49.662 --> 08:52.563
- into your basic character.
- Oh?

08:52.632 --> 08:55.795
Of course. With your usual
lack of subtlety,

08:55.868 --> 08:59.634
you would have no problem at all in
panicking anyone with anything at all to hide.

08:59.705 --> 09:02.765
- Actually, we might even go so far as to say...
- KITT?

09:02.842 --> 09:06.073
- Yes, Michael. I know.
- Shut up.

09:56.662 --> 09:59.130
Hi.
Hi.

10:16.082 --> 10:18.277
Looks like the training here
is pretty rough.

10:18.351 --> 10:20.615
Maybe this is what they do
for roll call.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.462
You sure this is part of the program?

10:41.474 --> 10:44.466
You big gorilla. I didn't know
you were in this class.

10:44.543 --> 10:47.910
Yeah. I would have turned it down if I
knew they let little wimps like you into it.

10:47.980 --> 10:50.039
Ha!

10:55.454 --> 10:59.117
If that's how they greet an old friend, I
wonder what they do when they meet an enemy?

10:59.191 --> 11:02.024
If we're careful,
we'll never find out.

11:02.094 --> 11:04.062
- Margot Wells.
- Michael Knight.

11:04.130 --> 11:08.226
Howdy. Keller. The freelance fightin'
game's been a little shaky lately.

11:08.300 --> 11:10.234
We're just trying to
keep our hand in. Yeah.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.236
We get high-strung
sitting around.

11:12.304 --> 11:14.829
Oh, man. Ain't nothin'
gonna get you high.

11:14.907 --> 11:17.398
I know what you mean.
That nervous energy keeps buildin'up.

11:17.476 --> 11:19.467
Name's Corey.
Jacobs.

11:19.545 --> 11:22.105
Now you know who to call
when you want to work it off.

11:22.181 --> 11:23.842
Uh-huh?

11:27.219 --> 11:30.950
I, uh, can think of a lot better
ways to burn off excess energy.

11:31.023 --> 11:34.652
Well, you can start by burning off
a little energy with that.

11:34.727 --> 11:38.424
I hate to be the one to break this
to ya, but this isn't Club Med.

11:38.497 --> 11:43.434
You mean, I'm not gonna need my perfume, my
makeup, my sexy gowns and my string bikinis?

11:43.502 --> 11:46.733
That sounds great to me, but it's probably
the wrong kind of ammunition.

12:03.189 --> 12:06.386
Hey, buddy. How about a little
snapshot of that little package, huh?

12:06.459 --> 12:09.792
Anything?

12:09.862 --> 12:15.425
Yes. A semiautomatic pistol,32 caliber,
three clips of ammunition.

12:15.501 --> 12:18.470
- Yeah?
- Also, seven blouses, four pairs of slacks,

12:18.537 --> 12:21.768
two pairs of shoes, six sets
of undergarments, three... KITT?

12:21.841 --> 12:24.139
- Yes, Michael?
- Shut up.

12:37.089 --> 12:41.526
Well, as you can see, this isn't your
ordinary, Sunday-go-to-meetin' windshield.

12:41.594 --> 12:44.188
Matter of fact, there's nothing about
any of these cars here that's ordinary.

12:44.263 --> 12:46.993
They're not indestructible.

12:47.066 --> 12:50.866
But they'll take a hit that would send a
production-line model directly to car heaven.

12:53.739 --> 12:57.266
Whoo! Any chance I can get
one of those for my live-in?

12:57.343 --> 12:59.334
I don't think you could afford
the both of them, Keller, anyway.

12:59.411 --> 13:01.641
Unless one, or both of'em,
were a dog.

13:01.714 --> 13:04.274
Seems to me that a water bed
would be more your style.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.284
Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!
Hey.

13:06.352 --> 13:08.946
Why don't you just save that
for the hand-to-hand class?

13:09.021 --> 13:11.717
Stow this, Jacobs.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.817
Now, none of you should be too impressed
with this little demonstration of mine.

13:14.894 --> 13:17.124
The best security measures
are those...

13:25.371 --> 13:27.305
What, are you nuts?
It's practice, remember?

13:27.373 --> 13:30.467
It was an accident! The strap caught
the trigger when I put it in the rack.

13:30.543 --> 13:32.704
No more accidents.
All right?

13:32.778 --> 13:35.941
All right, Knight.
All right.

13:36.015 --> 13:39.917
Now, if you ask me, it's crazy
using live ammo in the first place!

13:41.220 --> 13:43.654
Yeah. You're probably right.

13:43.722 --> 13:46.156
But it does keep everybody
on their toes, now, doesn't it?

13:46.225 --> 13:48.955
Come on. We got work to do.
Let's go. Come on!

14:05.878 --> 14:07.846
Hey, why don't you come back
and join the party?

14:18.791 --> 14:23.057
What's with that guy, anyway? Ah, he spent
three years in a Cuban prison in solitary.

14:23.128 --> 14:25.926
Ever since then, he gets
in these weird moods.

14:25.998 --> 14:29.957
Hey, where's Margot? I don't know. She said
something about having to make a phone call.

14:30.035 --> 14:32.060
Man, I hate white bread.

14:33.439 --> 14:37.375
Better go round her up before
Bigfoot here eats everything in sight.

14:37.443 --> 14:41.846
Hey, wait for me!
I need to call my bookie.

15:43.208 --> 15:46.143
Hey!

15:47.780 --> 15:51.181
Hey! Hey!

16:07.299 --> 16:11.702
Michael?

16:11.770 --> 16:13.704
Good morning.

16:15.975 --> 16:18.409
Is that your idea
of an alarm clock?

16:18.477 --> 16:22.208
Uh, good morning, Mr. Knight. No, it's just
a little Halloween smoke, that's all that is.

16:22.281 --> 16:26.980
But, uh, it could just as easily have been
dynamite, fulminate, les plastiques, you name it.

16:27.052 --> 16:29.384
Jacobs, shut up!

16:30.823 --> 16:33.724
But if I'd been a, uh,
a for-real bandito,

16:33.792 --> 16:37.489
now, I could have blown you people all so far
that your memories would have just been memories.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.464
And then, with you out of the way,
your V.I.P. would be defenseless.

16:40.532 --> 16:43.467
A sitting duck.
Don't take yourself for granted.

16:43.535 --> 16:46.026
A bodyguard is a target too.

16:46.105 --> 16:49.597
But what I want you to remember
is you gotta be on, every minute.

16:49.675 --> 16:51.609
All 24 hours of the day.

16:51.677 --> 16:55.010
Now you're on your own
until roll call.

16:55.080 --> 16:58.174
Knight.

16:58.250 --> 17:02.380
Remember.
All 24 hours of the day.

17:02.454 --> 17:04.854
That goes double for you, amigo.
Comprende?

17:06.157 --> 17:08.626
Comprende.

17:28.280 --> 17:33.115
Michael, where are your pants? Never
mind. KITT, I got a bone to pick with you.

17:33.185 --> 17:37.087
According to my data on human anatomy,
you have 206 bones,

17:37.156 --> 17:41.718
- give or take some questionable cartilage.
- I left you in your surveillance mode.

17:41.794 --> 17:44.729
Now, why didn't you signal me
when Redmond went into my bungalow?

17:44.797 --> 17:48.790
If you recall, you yourself told me
that Mr. Redmond could be trusted.

17:48.867 --> 17:51.392
Oh, is that supposed to be
an idea of your logic?

17:51.470 --> 17:53.995
No. It's an example of yours.

17:54.073 --> 17:57.270
Speaking of which, when are you planning
to start making these people nervous?

17:58.811 --> 18:00.745
I'm starting tonight.

18:00.813 --> 18:06.012
I'm gonna organize a card game. I'm gonna
get rowdy, and drunk, and indiscreet.

18:06.085 --> 18:08.986
Very well. But when are you
planning to do some work?

18:12.925 --> 18:14.859
Seven. Oh, that's good! I like that.

18:14.927 --> 18:18.090
Man, that's a fool's bet. Don't be bettin'
that. That's a good one! I like this. Here.

18:18.163 --> 18:20.461
- Here. Go ahead. Go ahead.
- Here's $60.

18:20.532 --> 18:23.899
Hey! Seven!

18:23.969 --> 18:26.267
Oh, man. Pick up your
money. Listen, you guys.

18:26.338 --> 18:28.272
You guys know anything
about this weirdo Jacobs?

18:28.340 --> 18:30.274
I mean, you ever work
with him before? He's weird.

18:30.342 --> 18:34.335
Hey, pal. In our line of work,
asking anything about anybody...

18:34.413 --> 18:36.347
is a risky proposition.

18:36.415 --> 18:40.749
Lopez, don't get so touchy.
I'm not asking anything about you.

18:40.819 --> 18:43.344
- Not yet, anyway.
- And that's the way I like to keep it.

18:43.422 --> 18:45.890
Hey! Come on, let's just
play cards, all right?

18:45.958 --> 18:49.257
Let's just play!
It's practically the 21 st century.

18:49.328 --> 18:53.230
You wanna bet anything worth knowing about you,
Lopez, or you, Keller, or any of us here at the table,

18:53.298 --> 18:55.391
is stored up
in some computer somewhere.

18:55.467 --> 18:57.401
And all you gotta do
is know one thing.

18:57.469 --> 19:01.064
- What?
- What buttons to push.

19:01.140 --> 19:02.835
Shut up. Shut up!

19:02.908 --> 19:05.809
Come on.
Let's play cards, huh?

19:05.878 --> 19:09.712
Okay, today you're gonna practice
some ambush and evasive tactics.

19:09.781 --> 19:14.377
It'll be two on one: Two cars
of baddies to one good guy.

19:14.453 --> 19:16.853
Now, Lopez, I want you and Corey
to take the limos.

19:16.922 --> 19:20.756
Knight, you and Keller
will attack Lopez.

19:20.826 --> 19:24.728
Margot. I'd like you and Jacobs
to attack Corey here.

19:24.796 --> 19:26.730
All right?
Two against one.

19:26.798 --> 19:30.564
Devon, I've been here two days, and I
thought I'd give you a preliminary report.

19:30.636 --> 19:33.002
Redmond is a genius in denims.

19:33.071 --> 19:35.733
What he doesn't know about terrorism
hasn't been discovered.

19:35.807 --> 19:39.174
Corey is the wise guy.
There's always one in every crowd.

19:39.244 --> 19:42.372
He gets away with it because he's good.

19:45.317 --> 19:47.649
Keller, he's the best driver in the group.

19:47.719 --> 19:49.949
He does things they haven't
thought of in Detroit.

19:50.022 --> 19:53.685
Lopez... Well, he always
has a smile on his face.

19:53.759 --> 19:56.057
He's as tough as
two men twice his size.

19:56.128 --> 19:58.119
Margot is the brains of the group.

19:58.197 --> 20:00.825
In class, she even startles Redmond.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.800
Jacobs is a killing machine, Devon,
through and through.

20:03.869 --> 20:06.667
In short, they're a perfect team.

20:06.738 --> 20:08.968
The kind I'd be real happy
to go into combat with.

20:09.041 --> 20:14.377
The problem is how do I detect
an assassin in a group of trained killers?

20:14.446 --> 20:17.574
The local hangout in town
is called the Buckaroo Club.

20:17.649 --> 20:20.777
I'll meet you there. Maybe one of us
will have a bright idea.

20:27.292 --> 20:30.955
Hello, cowboy.

20:31.029 --> 20:35.125
- Bonnie!
- Howdy, partner.

20:35.200 --> 20:38.499
Trail boss sent me
to round you up.

20:38.570 --> 20:40.595
Thataway.

20:45.677 --> 20:47.907
Did you change your hair
or something?

20:56.688 --> 21:00.021
Devon, you look ridiculous.

21:00.092 --> 21:02.356
Really? I thought
I looked like Gary Cooper.

21:02.427 --> 21:06.488
Michael, we've had a devil of a time
trying to find you tonight.

21:06.565 --> 21:10.626
Say, is this the only pub in this town?
It's country western.

21:10.702 --> 21:13.262
And yeah, it is.
Yes. Very primitive.

21:13.338 --> 21:15.704
And hideously noisy.
Wait, wait. That's chili!

21:15.774 --> 21:20.268
And believe me, a gourmet
like you wouldn't be interested.

21:20.345 --> 21:22.779
Very unassuming.
And much too simple.

21:22.848 --> 21:26.841
You know, cayenne is
no substitute for cumin.

21:26.918 --> 21:31.685
And all those beans.
Phew.

21:31.757 --> 21:34.783
And now, for a progress report.

21:34.860 --> 21:39.320
Do you realize that we're running
very near the edge, so to speak?

21:39.398 --> 21:42.390
Devon, I've tried running it up the
flagpole, but so far, nobody's saluted.

21:42.467 --> 21:45.561
- Hmm.
- Meaning what?

21:45.637 --> 21:49.505
Meaning that he hasn't had...
Any reaction worth talking about.

21:49.574 --> 21:54.068
Meaning that either there is no ringer,
or if there is one,

21:54.146 --> 21:56.239
his nerves are
a lot better than we thought.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.545
Or you're not as obvious as you might be.

21:59.618 --> 22:01.848
Though I find that
very hard to believe.

22:01.920 --> 22:05.083
Bonnie, did he actually
give me a compliment?

22:05.157 --> 22:10.151
Listen, do any of the drivers know
exactly what the mission is yet?

22:10.228 --> 22:13.891
No, of course not. Why should they be
briefed before it's absolutely necessary?

22:13.965 --> 22:17.264
That's true.
But if there is a bad guy...

22:17.336 --> 22:19.702
he would have to know,
wouldn't he?

22:19.771 --> 22:22.137
What a brilliant thought.

22:22.207 --> 22:25.074
Yes, of course he would.

22:41.293 --> 22:43.659
Well, Michael, I guess
we can call it a day.

22:43.729 --> 22:46.425
Not yet, KITT. I want to search
Margot's room.

22:46.498 --> 22:48.466
I've heard that one before.

22:48.533 --> 22:50.865
It'll give you something
to brood about during the night.

23:53.832 --> 23:56.596
Ow, that hurts! It's supposed
to... And are you armed,

23:56.668 --> 23:58.659
or do I have to embarrass
both of us by a frisk?

23:58.737 --> 24:01.331
What are you doin' in my
room? Would you buy lust?

24:01.406 --> 24:05.502
I wouldn't buy anything, at this point. Want to
tell me why you're packin' a gun in your suitcase?

24:05.577 --> 24:08.637
Yeah, just as soon as you tell me
why you want to know.

24:11.950 --> 24:13.941
You want to let me go?

24:20.392 --> 24:23.486
Look. We're all in this
to do a job.

24:23.562 --> 24:25.496
Not to spy on one another.

24:25.564 --> 24:28.590
Or are we?

24:35.440 --> 24:37.670
Okay. In this scenario,

24:37.742 --> 24:40.074
Lopez is the bodyguard,
Knight is the V.I.P.

24:40.145 --> 24:44.844
Now, Keller, Corey, Wells and Jacobs
are hunting them down.

24:44.916 --> 24:46.884
The Uzis will be using wax loads.

24:46.952 --> 24:50.353
- Hey, what's the effect of the wax load?
- Well, they sting like hell,

24:50.422 --> 24:53.152
and they leave a nice, red splat,
so you know you're dead.

24:53.225 --> 24:56.956
And when you find 'em, don't be gentle.
A little pain can be highly motivational.

24:58.296 --> 25:01.231
This could get very interesting.
Knight, Lopez.

25:01.299 --> 25:06.259
Remember, you're gonna have to be on your toes. It doesn't
matter what hat you pull your particular rabbit out of,

25:06.338 --> 25:09.102
all that matters is survival...
And as for the rest of you,

25:09.174 --> 25:12.940
the hit team... remember, when you
find those two boys, don't be gentle.

25:13.011 --> 25:15.002
Make 'em remember
that being stupid can hurt.

25:15.080 --> 25:18.675
Okay! You bozos are stuck...

25:18.750 --> 25:20.980
out in the middle of nowhere,
and you're unarmed.

25:21.052 --> 25:23.384
These people'll give you
two minutes head start.

25:26.958 --> 25:29.426
- Okay, take off.
- So what happened to the two minutes?

25:29.494 --> 25:31.928
Corey, the terrorists don't play fair.
Why should we?

25:31.997 --> 25:33.862
Go! Come on.
All right.

25:33.932 --> 25:35.957
- I'll outflank them.
- Yeah, that's a good idea.

25:58.590 --> 26:00.524
I hope you're on your toes, man.

26:00.592 --> 26:02.617
Yeah, it's mutual.

26:02.694 --> 26:07.154
It's a perfect setup. It's a good
thing their bullets aren't real.

26:07.232 --> 26:11.601
Yeah. Hey. I think
that we better split up.

26:11.670 --> 26:13.968
It'll double our chances.
Yeah, okay.

26:14.039 --> 26:16.030
Go. Good luck!

26:54.846 --> 26:58.247
KITT. If anyone's playin' for keeps,

26:58.316 --> 27:01.342
this would be the perfect time
for them to try.

27:01.419 --> 27:03.979
Get into this area and
monitor everything that moves.

27:19.704 --> 27:22.764
Michael, I'm scanning
the area now.

27:22.841 --> 27:26.868
Stand by. I should be able to home in
on your recent communicator.

27:26.945 --> 27:31.644
Come on. Come on!

27:43.528 --> 27:45.587
Was that Knight?

28:03.481 --> 28:07.747
Michael, I'm locked onto you.
There. You're due south of my position.

28:07.819 --> 28:09.753
It may take a little time
to reach you.

28:09.821 --> 28:12.915
Uh-oh.

28:12.991 --> 28:18.190
Michael, there's someone stalking you.
Approximately 150 meters northeast of you.

28:56.568 --> 28:59.264
KITT, I was right.
They're using real bullets.

28:59.337 --> 29:02.238
For someone who's been proven right,
you don't sound very pleased.

29:14.052 --> 29:16.543
Wells. What are you doing out here?
Where's your target?

29:16.621 --> 29:19.522
He's in trouble. Somebody's trying
to kill him. Wait! Are you sure?

29:19.591 --> 29:23.118
Jacobs. I got away. But he's hunting
down Michael, and Michael's unarmed.

29:23.194 --> 29:25.185
Come on. Let's get
some live ammo.

29:28.533 --> 29:31.468
KITT. You got me
on your scanners?

29:31.536 --> 29:33.629
- Yes, Michael.
- Look, Jacobs is stalking me.

29:33.705 --> 29:36.435
- Can you tell me where he is?
- I believe so, Michael.

29:36.508 --> 29:39.807
There's another person about 12 meters
southeast of your position.

29:39.878 --> 29:42.438
That's all I need to know.

30:23.788 --> 30:26.382
Congratulations, Knight.
You found your assassin.

30:46.644 --> 30:49.010
Are you hurt?
Tell me the truth, Michael.

30:49.080 --> 30:53.881
Devon, I'm fine. My first hunch
was right, though. It was Jacobs.

30:53.952 --> 30:57.786
Has he talked? Who financed him?
Did he...

30:57.856 --> 31:00.791
I'd like to be able
to pick his brain, but...

31:00.859 --> 31:04.090
Unfortunately, he challenged
an Uzi... and lost.

31:05.330 --> 31:07.696
Well, you'd better start home.
You can catch up in your paperwork...

31:07.765 --> 31:09.699
while I go meet
the Third World leaders.

31:09.767 --> 31:11.758
See you in a few hours, huh?

31:13.705 --> 31:15.764
Okay. Looks like
I'm out of here.

31:15.840 --> 31:18.240
Thank you very much.
Thank you, Mike. Good luck.

31:18.309 --> 31:20.903
All right.
See you, guys. Thanks.

31:22.413 --> 31:27.043
And you? Thank you very much
for saving my life.

31:33.057 --> 31:35.685
Hmm!

31:40.598 --> 31:43.567
Michael, you're strangely quiet.
Is something bothering you?

31:43.635 --> 31:45.933
KITT, the first day we arrived,

31:46.004 --> 31:49.735
Jacobs tried to kill me before
we put the game plan into action.

31:50.975 --> 31:52.909
Why did he make the try then?

31:52.977 --> 31:55.411
He had no reason to be suspicious
at that point.

31:55.480 --> 31:58.643
Perhaps it was just an accident,
as he claimed at the time.

31:58.716 --> 32:02.618
And perhaps there really is a tooth fairy,
and perhaps there really is a Santa Claus.

32:02.687 --> 32:04.621
Go to manual.

32:14.098 --> 32:16.692
- What are you doing, Michael?
- We're goin' back!

32:16.768 --> 32:19.862
We're gonna find out why our game plan
worked so flawlessly.

32:58.142 --> 33:00.133
What's he doin' here?

33:13.624 --> 33:16.684
Jacobs? You look pretty healthy
for a dead man.

33:27.171 --> 33:29.765
You shouldn't have come back, Michael.

33:29.841 --> 33:31.968
I figured that one out
for myself.

33:34.112 --> 33:36.376
How many of you were involved
in all this? All of us.

33:36.447 --> 33:39.644
The whole class. No kidding!
Boy, I got to hand it to you.

33:39.717 --> 33:42.914
That's brilliant.
You set me up, didn't you?

33:42.987 --> 33:45.888
You staged Jacobs's death.
All so I could call Devon...

33:45.957 --> 33:47.891
and everyone breathes
a big sigh of relief.

33:47.959 --> 33:53.454
Right! Then, when security is relaxed,
the Third World leaders are sitting ducks.

33:53.531 --> 33:56.261
Where's Redmond?
He's in town.

33:56.334 --> 33:58.325
He plans on coming back
to escort us to the airfield,

33:58.403 --> 34:01.429
but, uh, I think we're gonna leave
a little bit earlier than that.

34:01.506 --> 34:03.599
You didn't kill him!

34:03.674 --> 34:05.608
Michael, we're professionals.

34:05.676 --> 34:07.871
We only kill people
if we get paid for it.

34:07.945 --> 34:11.904
Or if they get in the way.
One thing still bothers me.

34:13.016 --> 34:16.475
Your dossiers are clean all the way back.
How'd you get past the security check?

34:16.554 --> 34:18.715
Wouldn't you like to know?
Leave him alone.

34:18.790 --> 34:21.657
Go out and move his car. We
don't want Redmond to see it.

34:24.027 --> 34:26.292
We all have
our political beliefs, Michael,

34:26.364 --> 34:30.926
but, uh, sometimes Jacobs
gets a little carried away.

34:31.002 --> 34:33.300
To answer your question,
we had a man on the inside.

34:33.371 --> 34:36.601
Michael? Michael, are you there?

34:36.674 --> 34:41.077
Michael, your audio isn't on.
I can hear you, but you can't hear me.

34:43.815 --> 34:46.511
I'm sorry about this, Michael.

34:46.583 --> 34:50.384
I really am.
Yeah, I bet you are.

34:50.455 --> 34:53.514
You know what? I liked you.
I liked you a lot.

34:53.591 --> 34:59.154
Hmm. But I think, behind your
pretty smile and your pretty face,

34:59.230 --> 35:02.461
there's nothin'
but a grinning skull.

35:25.690 --> 35:29.786
You both are forgetting one thing. You kill
me, there's gonna be a lot of questions.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.659
As far as Devon's concerned,
I'm driving home right now.

35:32.730 --> 35:35.062
Michael, don't give them any ideas.

35:47.912 --> 35:50.142
He's right, you know?

35:51.549 --> 35:54.211
- There will be questions.
- No kidding.

35:54.285 --> 35:56.753
You don't get bullet holes
cruising down the highway.

35:56.821 --> 36:00.188
Michael, how clever.
You want me to cooperate with them.

36:00.258 --> 36:04.251
- Perhaps we better arrange
a little accident.

36:04.328 --> 36:08.958
- What kind of accident?
- Lopez, why don't you go see what's keeping Jacobs?

36:09.033 --> 36:11.297
I think we're gonna
need that car.

36:11.369 --> 36:14.099
Got it!

36:14.172 --> 36:16.606
I wish there could be
another way, Michael.

36:19.177 --> 36:21.839
Hey, Jacobs! Hey, hey!

36:21.913 --> 36:24.074
What's the matter?
You've gone loco or something?

36:24.148 --> 36:26.673
Yeah, you try
opening the doors.

36:26.751 --> 36:29.311
I've never seen
anything like it.

36:31.956 --> 36:34.857
Hey, man.
The pressure's getting to you!

36:34.926 --> 36:37.861
I know you're never
gonna believe me,

36:37.929 --> 36:40.227
but I didn't want to hurt you.

36:44.702 --> 36:47.899
It's a little late
for that thought, isn't it?

36:47.972 --> 36:52.932
No. You won't feel any pain.

37:08.759 --> 37:11.250
Too bad, huh?

37:11.329 --> 37:15.288
The guy wrapped up the big case, but got
totaled in an accident on the way home.

37:16.334 --> 37:19.132
Whoever said life was fair?

37:19.203 --> 37:22.798
Okay, let's go. We got 30 minutes
until our sitting ducks touch down.

37:27.645 --> 37:30.512
Michael, you're gonna be very proud of me.
I did exactly what you wanted.

37:30.581 --> 37:33.982
I let them drive me up here
and put you inside...

37:34.051 --> 37:36.383
and Michael, you can stop
pretending now.

37:39.090 --> 37:41.854
Michael. Michael?

37:43.361 --> 37:47.092
You're not pretending, are you?
Michael, wake up!

37:47.164 --> 37:50.793
This should help.

37:55.773 --> 37:57.968
- KITT?
- I see you're awake.

37:58.042 --> 38:03.674
Michael, I'm afraid we have a problem.
Seven-eighths of a kilometer ahead is a steep drop.

38:03.748 --> 38:06.376
A drop?
Actually, a cliff.

38:06.450 --> 38:09.977
At our rate of speed, we'll pass over
the edge in less than ten seconds.

38:10.054 --> 38:13.455
We will then fall 456 meters
to the canyon floor below.

38:13.524 --> 38:17.119
- Great!
- I may survive the impact. However, you will not.

38:17.194 --> 38:19.685
- Just hit the brakes!
- I am hitting the brakes.

38:19.764 --> 38:22.358
Stop the car!

38:22.433 --> 38:25.527
I'm trying, Michael.
But the law of gravity takes precedent.

38:25.603 --> 38:28.629
If you're familiar with
Newton's Laws of Motion, then...

38:28.706 --> 38:31.971
Rotate your turbo-booster.

38:41.552 --> 38:44.544
Okay. That wa...
That's just too close.

38:44.622 --> 38:48.058
And also, a brilliant demonstration
of Newton's Third Law of Motion.

38:48.125 --> 38:52.494
Yeah, great. Grade me later.
Just... Let's get out of here.

39:42.246 --> 39:44.771
Come to Mama.

39:46.117 --> 39:49.382
Foundation Control, this is Summit One.
Request landing clearance.

39:50.888 --> 39:53.322
Summit One, this is Foundation Control.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.621
Devon Miles is standing by
to greet your party.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.684
You are cleared to land.

39:58.696 --> 40:00.926
Roger, Foundation. Over.

40:22.553 --> 40:25.021
Welcome. Would you
follow me, please?

40:26.290 --> 40:29.589
Summit One, we are on a strict schedule.
Please clear the runway.

40:32.663 --> 40:35.598
KITT, patch me through to Devon.
I want to warn him.

40:35.666 --> 40:37.463
Sorry, Michael.
I can't get through!

40:37.535 --> 40:39.765
Why? We got to be in range
of the airfield!

40:39.837 --> 40:42.897
We are. But the security precautions
for the Third World leaders...

40:42.973 --> 40:45.669
- include a telephone security code.
- You don't have it?

40:45.743 --> 40:49.270
Human error, Michael.
You told Devon the case was closed.

40:49.346 --> 40:52.110
- Can you break the code?
- Do we have an hour?

40:52.183 --> 40:54.845
We don't have five minutes.

40:58.255 --> 41:01.418
Michael, I have the assassination team
on the scanners.

41:01.492 --> 41:03.585
We will overtake them
in a matter of minutes.

41:03.661 --> 41:05.856
Good! Don't let 'em
out of your sight.

41:05.930 --> 41:09.764
I don't intend to. Michael, I should point
out that those cars are heavily armored...

41:09.834 --> 41:12.462
and capable of
great rates of speed.

41:12.536 --> 41:14.504
Although I'm more than a match
for any one of them,

41:14.572 --> 41:17.735
five at once could be a problem.

41:17.808 --> 41:20.208
In that case,
we'll whittle 'em down one by one.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.581
There they are, KITT.
We're not too late.

42:09.059 --> 42:11.653
This way, please.

42:11.729 --> 42:14.129
Summit Two, please clear the runway.

42:15.232 --> 42:18.895
Summit Three, this is Foundation
Control. You are cleared to land.

42:23.274 --> 42:26.732
Everybody, we're being pursued.
I don't know how, but it's Knight.

42:28.112 --> 42:31.741
- That's impossible!
- Yeah, well, "Impossible" is following at about 90 miles an hour!

42:31.815 --> 42:34.613
Pull the limos over.
We'll stop him right here.

42:34.685 --> 42:38.246
- Got it.
- Uh, yeah, that's a roger.

42:51.869 --> 42:54.269
Uh-oh.

42:55.673 --> 42:57.436
Okay!
Here we go, KITT.

43:06.417 --> 43:09.284
Whoo! Yeah!

43:09.353 --> 43:11.480
That's two down, KITT.
And three to go.

43:28.872 --> 43:32.330
How very nice to see you.
Won't you come in?

43:39.717 --> 43:43.084
- He's back! He's still there!
- You go on. We'll nail him.

43:43.153 --> 43:46.384
- And then catch up with you.
- Yeah. I got you on the right there.

43:53.564 --> 43:57.193
Michael, they've split up. Two of
them are heading directly towards us.

43:57.267 --> 44:00.168
I noticed. I noticed.

44:00.237 --> 44:03.365
It's worse than I thought. The
limousines have reentered the picture.

44:05.476 --> 44:08.809
Michael, all four vehicles
are converging on our position.

44:08.879 --> 44:11.370
They will impact with us
in less than ten seconds.

44:11.448 --> 44:16.818
Not if I can help it.

44:21.992 --> 44:24.483
Whoo! Yeah!

44:24.561 --> 44:27.189
Let's get out of here, KITT,
and save the Third World leaders.

44:27.264 --> 44:29.095
Not to mention our reputations.

44:41.311 --> 44:44.940
Jacobs, where are you?

44:45.015 --> 44:47.506
Jacobs? Corey?

44:47.584 --> 44:51.543
Keller! Lopez!
Are you there?

44:58.829 --> 45:01.855
I'm sure the cars will be here
at any moment, gentlemen.

45:04.935 --> 45:07.233
She's dangerously close
to the Third World leaders, Michael.

45:07.304 --> 45:09.295
We have to, KITT.
I owe that lady.

45:26.123 --> 45:28.489
Mr. Miles, there's
a single car approaching.

45:34.832 --> 45:36.891
Stop that gray car
at all costs!

46:27.618 --> 46:29.609
- Hello, Devon.
- What kept you?

46:29.686 --> 46:32.814
- Am I late?
- No.

46:50.741 --> 46:54.404
Oh, Devon! Hi!

46:54.478 --> 46:56.844
Michael, are you
out of your mind?

46:56.914 --> 46:58.939
These people have
a serious and critical meeting!

46:59.016 --> 47:02.315
Well, that's why they got to unwind!

47:02.386 --> 47:05.685
- I'll be right there, Abdul.
- Devvy! Come on, I'll buy you a beer.

47:05.756 --> 47:08.520
"Devvy"?
Devon!

47:08.592 --> 47:10.526
You represent the Free World
to these people.

47:10.594 --> 47:13.392
You don't want 'em to think
we're all sticks in the mud, do ya?

47:13.463 --> 47:15.931
Come on! Come on!

47:15.999 --> 47:18.729
Now, look here...

47:58.976 --> 48:02.969
Michael Knight,
a lone crusader in a dangerous world,

48:03.046 --> 48:06.072
the world of the Knight Rider.
