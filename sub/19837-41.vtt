00:11.020 --> 00:12.450
<b>My brother sent the URL.</b>

00:12.450 --> 00:13.200
<b>Great!</b>

00:13.200 --> 00:14.600
<b>Let's get started.</b>

00:14.600 --> 00:15.510
<b>Yeah!</b>

01:40.990 --> 01:46.040
<b>Gathering x Of x Heroes</b>

01:47.900 --> 01:50.420
<b>As Kurapika obtains his ticket</b>

<b>Gon and Killua also prepare for the auction</b>

01:57.610 --> 01:59.820
<b>in Yorknew City.</b>

02:07.800 --> 02:10.270
<b>This is the website for Hunters?</b>

02:10.560 --> 02:14.910
<b>Yeah, I've heard that Hunters 
worldwide post information here.</b>

02:14.910 --> 02:16.750
<b>Worldwide?</b>

02:16.750 --> 02:18.030
<b>Wow...</b>

02:20.920 --> 02:22.740
<b>Please swipe your Hunter License,</b>

02:23.550 --> 02:26.320
<b>and enter your license code.</b>

02:36.850 --> 02:39.030
<b>Put the cursor on the bartender.</b>

02:40.880 --> 02:43.210
<b>What kind of information would you like?</b>

02:44.720 --> 02:47.080
<b>Wow! There's so much!</b>

02:47.470 --> 02:48.750
<b>Select the game category.</b>

02:52.450 --> 02:53.530
<b>There it is.</b>

02:53.530 --> 02:54.780
<b><i>Greed Island</i>.</b>

02:56.300 --> 02:58.320
<b>It will cost twenty million Jenny.</b>

02:58.320 --> 03:00.060
<b>Twenty million...</b>

03:00.060 --> 03:02.780
<b>So they won't give out the 
information for free.</b>

03:02.780 --> 03:04.700
<b>Well, we don't really have a choice.</b>

03:05.320 --> 03:07.950
<b>Deposit twenty million...</b>

03:10.760 --> 03:12.350
<b>I can feel aura coming from the monitor!</b>

03:16.490 --> 03:20.780
<b>I guess only <i>Nen</i> users can enter this site.</b>

03:21.420 --> 03:22.220
<b>Okay,</b>

03:22.580 --> 03:24.380
<b>now listen carefully.</b>

03:25.030 --> 03:26.470
<b><i>Greed Island</i> is</b>

03:26.980 --> 03:29.480
<b>a game created by <i>Nen</i> practitioners.</b>

03:31.450 --> 03:34.190
<b>Apparently, there were multiple creators,</b>

03:34.190 --> 03:36.290
<b>but no one knows their objective.</b>

03:36.290 --> 03:39.740
<b>They put <i>Nen</i> into all hundred 
copies of the game.</b>

03:40.160 --> 03:43.130
<b>When you start the game, 
the <i>Nen</i> activates,</b>

03:43.130 --> 03:45.490
<b>pulling the player inside the game.</b>

03:45.920 --> 03:47.380
<b>Inside the game?</b>

03:48.040 --> 03:51.120
<b>Only <i>Nen</i> practitioners can play the game.</b>

03:51.420 --> 03:54.880
<b>And as long as the player stays 
alive within the game,</b>

03:54.880 --> 03:56.880
<b>it will continue to run,</b>

03:56.880 --> 03:58.230
<b>even if the console is unplugged.</b>

03:58.230 --> 03:59.700
<b>It will stop if the player dies.</b>

04:01.590 --> 04:04.140
<b>One person who owned the game</b>

04:04.140 --> 04:06.890
<b>hired fifty Hunters to give it a shot,</b>

04:07.550 --> 04:10.200
<b>but none of them ever came back.</b>

04:11.280 --> 04:14.650
<b>I hear that you can return 
if you find a save point.</b>

04:16.600 --> 04:18.040
<b>Is that true?</b>

04:18.040 --> 04:20.120
<b>This information is from 
the Hunter website.</b>

04:20.120 --> 04:21.650
<b>It's gotta be accurate.</b>

04:22.430 --> 04:24.410
<b>At the Yorknew City auction,</b>

04:24.970 --> 04:30.410
<b>seven copies of <i>Greed Island</i>

04:31.070 --> 04:34.790
<b>The lowest starting bid is 8.9 billion Jenny.</b>

04:35.140 --> 04:37.100
<b>8.9 billion?!</b>

04:37.100 --> 04:38.990
<b>The price has shot up!</b>

04:38.990 --> 04:41.420
<b>That's 3 billion more than the retail price!</b>

04:42.080 --> 04:44.300
<b>Difficulty of obtainment is G-rank.</b>

04:44.300 --> 04:45.370
<b>Huh?</b>

04:45.370 --> 04:47.580
<b>The game is considered a legend,</b>

04:47.580 --> 04:49.600
<b>but there are plenty of copies.</b>

04:50.100 --> 04:54.310
<b>If you have enough money, 
it's relatively easy to procure.</b>

04:54.600 --> 04:57.290
<b>Hmm, a G...</b>

04:57.290 --> 04:58.810
<b>Lower than I expected.</b>

04:59.230 --> 05:02.070
<b><i>The message is that if I can't

05:02.070 --> 05:04.820
<b><i>I'll never be able to find you,</i></b>

05:05.090 --> 05:06.130
<b><i>Ging.</i></b>

05:12.150 --> 05:14.830
<b>Still, the money is a big problem.</b>

05:16.120 --> 05:19.970
<b>Hey, can we participate in the auction?</b>

05:19.970 --> 05:22.110
<b>They're starting at 8.9 billion!</b>

05:22.110 --> 05:24.280
<b>That's out of our league.</b>

05:24.280 --> 05:27.770
<b>No, I mean by selling stuff.</b>

05:27.770 --> 05:28.990
<b>Selling?</b>

05:28.990 --> 05:29.850
<b>That's it!</b>

05:29.850 --> 05:33.600
<b>We can look for treasure, 
and then auction it off.</b>

05:33.600 --> 05:34.730
<b>Okay!</b>

05:34.730 --> 05:37.400
<b>We can start with the 800 million we earned</b>

05:37.400 --> 05:39.360
<b>at Heavens Arena, and go from there.</b>

05:39.360 --> 05:40.610
<b>Yep!</b>

05:41.100 --> 05:45.970
<b>First, we'll start with online flea 
markets and auction websites.</b>

05:47.070 --> 05:47.860
<b>And see</b>

05:47.860 --> 05:49.990
<b>what we can dig up.</b>

05:50.480 --> 05:54.370
<b>We'll increase our money,

05:54.370 --> 05:55.250
<b>Yeah!</b>

06:12.400 --> 06:13.560
<b>Yay!</b>

06:23.970 --> 06:26.070
<b>How much do we have left?</b>

06:26.640 --> 06:29.860
<b>Combined, we're at 10.84 million.</b>

06:33.260 --> 06:34.750
<b>Damn...</b>

06:34.750 --> 06:37.540
<b>Initially, we were making a profit.</b>

06:38.840 --> 06:42.640
<b>That's why I said we should only 
use trustworthy public sites.</b>

06:42.640 --> 06:44.190
<b>I couldn't help it!</b>

06:44.190 --> 06:47.120
<b>Only the risky sites are profitable.</b>

06:49.770 --> 06:52.080
<b>It isn't working...</b>

06:54.190 --> 06:57.810
<b>Now, show me what you've brought.</b>

06:58.920 --> 07:01.300
<b>The hair of the famous actress Sara,</b>

07:01.300 --> 07:03.310
<b>and a DNA test to validate authenticity.</b>

07:03.680 --> 07:07.320
<b>The right arm of an Egyptian mummy, 
taken directly from a pyramid.</b>

07:08.040 --> 07:10.570
<b>The scaly skin of an ichthyosis patient.</b>

07:11.080 --> 07:13.330
<b>The skull of a one-horned creature.</b>

07:15.750 --> 07:19.460
<b>Okay, all four of you are hired.</b>

07:19.780 --> 07:22.710
<b>I'm Dalzollene, the head bodyguard.</b>

07:23.210 --> 07:24.330
<b>It's a pleasure.</b>

07:24.780 --> 07:27.710
<b>I'll need you to start working immediately.</b>

07:28.210 --> 07:33.470
<b>Your mission is to escort the boss 
to a Yorknew City hotel room.</b>

07:34.060 --> 07:38.970
<b>A private aircraft will take you to 
Lingon Airport, just outside Yorknew.</b>

07:39.330 --> 07:40.980
<b>The trip between airport and hotel</b>

07:40.980 --> 07:42.670
<b>takes approximately ninety minutes.</b>

07:43.060 --> 07:44.610
<b>A special car has been prepared.</b>

07:45.160 --> 07:49.180
<b>You four will provide the 
outer ring of security.</b>

07:49.180 --> 07:50.740
<b>Any questions?</b>

07:51.440 --> 07:53.860
<b>Do you know who might 
be targeting the boss?</b>

07:54.220 --> 07:57.080
<b>That question isn't worth an answer.</b>

07:57.080 --> 07:58.330
<b>What do you mean?</b>

07:58.990 --> 08:01.120
<b>The boss is an important 
figure in the underworld.</b>

08:01.640 --> 08:04.050
<b>There are plenty of people with 
reasons to hold a grudge.</b>

08:04.580 --> 08:07.130
<b>Let me rephrase since you 
didn't understand the first time.</b>

08:08.140 --> 08:10.610
<b>Regardless of grudges, do you know</b>

08:10.610 --> 08:14.240
<b>anyone who might actually
commit to an attack?</b>

08:14.770 --> 08:18.270
<b>If we can identify a few candidates, we'll know 
their motives, styles, and circumstances,</b>

08:18.270 --> 08:19.910
<b>and we can prepare accordingly.</b>

08:19.910 --> 08:22.270
<b>That will facilitate protecting the boss.</b>

08:23.710 --> 08:25.770
<b>You said that your name is Kurapika?</b>

08:26.220 --> 08:28.520
<b>You are the one who doesn't understand.</b>

08:29.230 --> 08:31.050
<b>Our job is to protect the boss,</b>

08:31.050 --> 08:35.060
<b>no matter who, when, 
where, or how they attack.</b>

08:35.720 --> 08:38.280
<b>That's all you need to know!</b>

08:38.630 --> 08:41.540
<b>Don't bother building a mental profile.</b>

08:42.010 --> 08:44.670
<b>If anything comes too close, it's hostile.</b>

08:49.120 --> 08:50.800
<b>I'll introduce you to the boss.</b>

08:50.800 --> 08:51.910
<b>Come with me.</b>

09:04.240 --> 09:05.290
<b>Excuse me.</b>

09:05.290 --> 09:06.480
<b>What's that?</b>

09:08.640 --> 09:10.870
<b>It's a little too realistic.</b>

09:11.430 --> 09:14.230
<b>Yes, that is an actual human being.</b>

09:15.250 --> 09:17.450
<b>He was once a fellow bodyguard.</b>

09:17.750 --> 09:19.890
<b>He ignored my advice,</b>

09:19.890 --> 09:21.950
<b>and let himself be deceived 
by false information,</b>

09:22.260 --> 09:26.330
<b>placing not only the other bodyguards, 
but the boss in danger as well.</b>

09:26.720 --> 09:28.880
<b>So he was punished.</b>

09:29.360 --> 09:31.710
<b>You are replacing him.</b>

09:32.700 --> 09:33.770
<b>Let's go.</b>

09:41.520 --> 09:44.560
<b>Boss, I've brought the new bodyguards.</b>

09:47.160 --> 09:48.230
<b>Please enter.</b>

10:01.380 --> 10:03.240
<b>This is the boss, Neon-sama.</b>

10:06.170 --> 10:08.820
<b>Nice to meet you, everyone.</b>

10:20.960 --> 10:24.850
<b>Anyway, I was pretty surprised when 
we were introduced to the boss.</b>

10:25.190 --> 10:26.680
<b>No kidding...</b>

10:26.680 --> 10:28.730
<b>They called her an important 
figure in the underworld,</b>

10:28.730 --> 10:32.070
<b>so I was expecting someone intimidating,</b>

10:32.070 --> 10:34.060
<b>but she turned out to be a cute little girl.</b>

11:07.050 --> 11:09.440
<b>Pakunoda, how's it going?</b>

11:10.000 --> 11:12.100
<b>Long time no see, Shalnark.</b>

11:12.740 --> 11:13.740
<b>You, too, Phinks.</b>

11:14.690 --> 11:16.650
<b>You sure took your time getting here.</b>

11:17.120 --> 11:18.190
<b>Oh?</b>

11:18.190 --> 11:19.920
<b>I believe I'm right on schedule.</b>

11:19.920 --> 11:23.090
<b>You're supposed to arrive 
ten minutes ahead of time.</b>

11:23.090 --> 11:24.280
<b>Same to you guys.</b>

11:25.730 --> 11:26.650
<b>Bonolenov!</b>

11:27.170 --> 11:28.410
<b>Kortopi!</b>

11:29.150 --> 11:31.200
<b>You guys are going with us, too?</b>

11:32.580 --> 11:33.420
<b>Yo!</b>

11:34.070 --> 11:36.780
<b>Haven't seen your faces in a while.</b>

11:38.200 --> 11:40.360
<b>I'm here, chief.</b>

11:40.360 --> 11:42.360
<b>What's our target this time?</b>

11:42.360 --> 11:44.180
<b>Give us our orders!</b>

11:44.530 --> 11:46.390
<b>Don't be in such a rush, Uvo.</b>

11:46.710 --> 11:49.380
<b>Feitan's group won't arrive until evening.</b>

11:49.380 --> 11:51.070
<b>We'll wait until everyone's here.</b>

11:51.650 --> 11:53.560
<b>You have no patience.</b>

11:53.560 --> 11:56.750
<b>Damn, half a day of waiting.</b>

11:57.380 --> 11:58.070
<b>Oh?</b>

11:58.430 --> 12:00.130
<b>Is that Shizuku?</b>

12:00.580 --> 12:01.570
<b>Hello.</b>

12:03.040 --> 12:05.620
<b>Has the other new addition arrived yet?</b>

12:05.620 --> 12:06.330
<b>No idea...</b>

12:06.840 --> 12:08.770
<b>You should ask Machi.</b>

12:37.680 --> 12:39.610
<b>This is for September.</b>

12:40.290 --> 12:42.680
<b>Huh? So many?</b>

12:42.680 --> 12:43.900
<b>Yeah,</b>

12:43.900 --> 12:47.870
<b>Rotfelli-sama and Trinc-sama

12:48.380 --> 12:50.490
<b>That just sucks.</b>

12:50.490 --> 12:53.410
<b>I told you to stop increasing my workload.</b>

12:53.900 --> 12:55.310
<b>I apologize.</b>

12:56.010 --> 12:59.750
<b>Both of them are friendly with your father.</b>

13:00.160 --> 13:02.510
<b>And what's Daddy doing?</b>

13:02.840 --> 13:05.760
<b>He had to attend a meeting.</b>

13:05.760 --> 13:08.670
<b>He's probably off playing golf or hunting.</b>

13:10.600 --> 13:12.960
<b>Daddy? This is Neon.</b>

13:14.000 --> 13:15.470
<b>What? No!</b>

13:15.470 --> 13:17.270
<b>You can't fool me!</b>

13:17.810 --> 13:18.780
<b>No.</b>

13:19.080 --> 13:20.020
<b>No!</b>

13:20.450 --> 13:21.460
<b>Huh?</b>

13:23.070 --> 13:25.570
<b>Fine, you have to keep your word.</b>

13:25.570 --> 13:28.030
<b>If you break another promise, I'll quit.</b>

13:29.950 --> 13:33.040
<b>Yay! I get another piece of treasure!</b>

13:33.820 --> 13:35.340
<b>A sweet deal.</b>

13:35.980 --> 13:37.670
<b>Congratulations.</b>

13:37.920 --> 13:38.980
<b>Okay...</b>

13:38.980 --> 13:41.420
<b>Since that's settled, I'll get this over with.</b>

<b>Angelic Auto Writing

<b>I hear she's an incredible diviner.</b>

14:14.240 --> 14:15.690
<b>Thanks to her father's connections,</b>

14:15.690 --> 14:19.540
<b>she's made clients of some very

<b>No, it's the other way around.</b>

14:22.450 --> 14:23.390
<b>Other way around?</b>

14:23.790 --> 14:27.590
<b>I'd say that the father has used

<b>his standing in the underworld.</b>

14:30.770 --> 14:33.180
<b>That's why he is frightened of losing her.</b>

<b>Afraid that his enemies</b>

14:35.510 --> 14:39.570
<b>might strike back at his daughter.</b>

14:41.640 --> 14:43.150
<b>Okay, all done.</b>

14:43.510 --> 14:44.360
<b>Here.</b>

14:44.630 --> 14:46.070
<b>Excellent work.</b>

14:46.760 --> 14:49.820
<b>Say, tomorrow's auction starts at night, right?</b>

14:49.820 --> 14:51.700
<b>I want to do some shopping beforehand.</b>

14:52.030 --> 14:54.700
<b>Very well, I shall accompany you.</b>

15:08.550 --> 15:10.830
<b>How many years has it been</b>

15:10.830 --> 15:13.720
<b>since all thirteen Troupe members gathered,</b>

15:13.720 --> 15:14.760
<b>Feitan?</b>

15:15.260 --> 15:17.210
<b>Three years, two months.</b>

<b>However, two members have since changed.</b>

<b>#4 and #8 are now different people.</b>

<b>Machi, will #4,</b>

<b>Hisoka, actually show up today?</b>

15:30.610 --> 15:32.050
<b>No idea.</b>

15:32.050 --> 15:33.530
<b>Don't ask me.</b>

15:33.530 --> 15:35.360
<b>Wasn't he your responsibility?</b>

15:35.750 --> 15:37.490
<b>I was only supposed to tell him to come.</b>

15:38.100 --> 15:40.720
<b>I don't like Hisoka.</b>

<b>Why does the chief let

15:43.700 --> 15:45.490
<b>Because he has skills.</b>

15:46.470 --> 15:47.460
<b>Skills, huh?</b>

15:47.800 --> 15:51.190
<b>His Bungee Gum is quite impressive.</b>

15:51.190 --> 15:53.510
<b>It would be difficult to counter.</b>

15:53.830 --> 15:55.390
<b>What's your point?</b>

15:55.800 --> 15:58.890
<b>Are you claiming that the 
chief is afraid of Hisoka?</b>

15:58.890 --> 16:00.380
<b>I won't let that statement stand.</b>

16:00.380 --> 16:02.140
<b>That's not what I meant.</b>

16:02.140 --> 16:06.400
<b>You're all being too generous. 
He's nothing special.</b>

16:07.610 --> 16:10.360
<b>Talk is cheap, as always.</b>

16:19.820 --> 16:21.050
<b>Nobunaga,</b>

16:21.050 --> 16:23.670
<b>this is what happens when I 
keep quiet and let you yap.</b>

16:24.150 --> 16:27.420
<b>You were talking as much as I was, Franklin.</b>

16:27.850 --> 16:29.230
<b>And so it begins.</b>

16:29.230 --> 16:30.520
<b>Ignore them.</b>

16:30.520 --> 16:33.430
<b>They're just playing around again.</b>

16:34.240 --> 16:37.680
<b>Anyway, why is the chief 
calling everyone together?</b>

16:37.980 --> 16:40.380
<b>We're thieves.</b>

16:40.380 --> 16:42.640
<b>There's something he wants us to steal.</b>

16:42.640 --> 16:44.350
<b>Well, I know that much.</b>

16:48.220 --> 16:51.470
<b>Yes, we've arrived at the hotel.</b>

16:51.950 --> 16:55.200
<b>However, one of the lady's 
fortunes concerned me...</b>

16:55.750 --> 16:59.200
<b>"An underground chamber 
where everything costs extra.</b>

16:59.200 --> 17:01.720
<b>That is where you will sleep.</b>

17:02.130 --> 17:05.420
<b>Never descend stairs that 
you didn't first ascend.</b>

17:05.420 --> 17:08.210
<b>Do not compete with others at numbers."</b>

17:08.830 --> 17:12.250
<b>There were three other poems 
that begin with this verse.</b>

17:12.250 --> 17:16.470
<b>Meaning that all four clients 
received the same fortune.</b>

17:16.890 --> 17:19.220
<b>The only thing connecting them</b>

17:19.220 --> 17:23.730
<b>is that they will be attending the 
underground auction this year.</b>

17:24.480 --> 17:28.120
<b>So the fortune is saying that 
their lives are at risk,</b>

17:28.120 --> 17:29.610
<b>should they participate?</b>

17:30.100 --> 17:33.830
<b>I'm assuming that "sleep" is a metaphor</b>

17:33.830 --> 17:35.860
<b>for succumbing to illness or death.</b>

17:36.270 --> 17:37.580
<b>I understand.</b>

17:37.580 --> 17:40.870
<b>I will pass the fortunes on to the clients.</b>

17:41.340 --> 17:43.120
<b>One more thing.</b>

17:43.700 --> 17:47.000
<b>The lady never remembers 
the fortunes she's told,</b>

17:47.000 --> 17:49.880
<b>and she cannot tell her own fortune.</b>

17:50.460 --> 17:53.630
<b>Does it make sense to let her 
participate in the auction?</b>

17:53.630 --> 17:54.720
<b>No!</b>

17:54.720 --> 17:56.940
<b>Bring her back immediately!</b>

17:56.940 --> 18:01.760
<b>However, I will need a proper 
explanation, or she'll never listen.</b>

18:02.120 --> 18:05.810
<b>If she throws a tantrum, 
we won't be able to stop her.</b>

18:06.940 --> 18:09.360
<b>In any case, don't take her 
to the auction site.</b>

18:09.760 --> 18:12.520
<b>Send some bodyguards to place bids.</b>

18:12.880 --> 18:14.060
<b>I understand.</b>

18:20.560 --> 18:21.730
<b>Neon...</b>

18:28.420 --> 18:29.580
<b>He's not coming.</b>

18:29.910 --> 18:31.600
<b>The sun's about to rise.</b>

18:32.060 --> 18:33.670
<b>Damn Hisoka...</b>

18:33.930 --> 18:36.530
<b>Next time I see him, I'll tear him apart.</b>

18:40.980 --> 18:42.430
<b>Oh, dear...</b>

18:43.480 --> 18:46.210
<b>That sounds quite gruesome.</b>

18:46.750 --> 18:48.440
<b>How very scary.</b>

18:48.730 --> 18:50.480
<b>Hisoka, you bastard!</b>

18:50.480 --> 18:52.060
<b>You're late.</b>

18:52.510 --> 18:55.570
<b>Man, I thought you weren't going to come.</b>

18:56.120 --> 18:59.070
<b>You asked me to come...</b>

18:59.570 --> 19:01.400
<b>Had I broken my promise,</b>

19:01.400 --> 19:05.950
<b>I would never get to see 
your Nen Stitches again.</b>

19:07.160 --> 19:09.330
<b>Chief, everyone's here.</b>

19:17.210 --> 19:20.300
<b>Chief, what are we stealing this time?</b>

19:21.760 --> 19:24.850
<b>We shall take the underground 
auction's treasures.</b>

19:25.320 --> 19:26.970
<b>Which ones?</b>

19:27.400 --> 19:30.850
<b>Ancient texts? 
Because the chief likes books.</b>

19:31.190 --> 19:33.730
<b>No, I'm thinking games.</b>

19:34.320 --> 19:37.700
<b>There will be multiple copies of the 
most expensive game ever for sale.</b>

19:38.170 --> 19:41.860
<b>Wouldn't it be logical to take 
precious metals and gemstones?</b>

19:42.430 --> 19:43.810
<b>Everything.</b>

19:45.080 --> 19:47.870
<b>We're taking everything 
that's up for auction.</b>

19:50.810 --> 19:52.620
<b>Are you serious, chief?</b>

19:53.370 --> 19:57.270
<b>The underground auction is run by 
gangs from across the world.</b>

19:57.730 --> 20:03.470
<b>If we do that, we'll be making 
enemies of them all...</b>

20:04.730 --> 20:07.010
<b>Are you frightened, Uvogin?</b>

20:08.250 --> 20:10.260
<b>I'm thrilled!</b>

20:10.260 --> 20:12.270
<b>I'm shaking with excitement...</b>

20:13.110 --> 20:15.520
<b>Give us the command, chief!</b>

20:15.830 --> 20:17.020
<b>Right now!</b>

20:22.300 --> 20:23.990
<b>You have my permission...</b>

20:23.990 --> 20:25.180
<b>Kill them.</b>

20:26.950 --> 20:29.440
<b>Kill every person who interferes.</b>

20:36.860 --> 20:38.420
<b>Good work.</b>

20:38.690 --> 20:40.760
<b>I have your next assignment.</b>

20:41.410 --> 20:45.480
<b>You must win the three items on this list 
at the underground auction.</b>

20:45.980 --> 20:47.770
<b>Money is no object.</b>

20:50.970 --> 20:53.190
<b>The complete mummy of Princess Corco.</b>

20:53.930 --> 20:57.730
<b>A tissue used by the actor, Son Remarch.</b>

20:57.730 --> 20:59.800
<b>Complete with DNA validation.</b>

21:01.460 --> 21:02.320
<b>And...</b>

21:02.760 --> 21:05.070
<b>The eyeballs of a Kurta, also known</b>

21:05.380 --> 21:06.570
<b>as scarlet eyes.</b>

21:10.330 --> 21:15.210
<b>Also, we've received information that 
there will be an attack on the auction.</b>

21:15.570 --> 21:19.240
<b>Prepare for any unexpected complications,</b>

21:19.240 --> 21:22.590
<b>while focusing on the primary 
objective of obtaining these items.</b>

21:29.920 --> 21:30.800
<b><i>They're coming.</i></b>

21:31.610 --> 21:34.600
<b><i>They are definitely coming!</i></b>

21:36.370 --> 21:39.160
<b>Kurapika awaits his chance 
to avenge his brethren.</b>

21:39.660 --> 21:42.190
<b>The Phantom Troupe, 
a band of murdering thieves.</b>

21:42.710 --> 21:44.570
<b>The sun has risen on the first day</b>

21:45.070 --> 21:48.450
<b>of the auction, where all sides will soon clash.</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.110
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.060 --> 23:06.440
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

23:02.950 --> 23:03.650
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:03.650 --> 23:05.300
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:06.620 --> 23:07.470
<b>It's Gon</b>

23:07.470 --> 23:08.320
<b>and Killua's</b>

23:08.320 --> 23:09.460
<b>Hunterpedia!</b>

23:08.570 --> 23:20.000
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:09.460 --> 23:10.910
<b>Today, we introduce Neon!</b>

23:10.910 --> 23:12.940
<b>She's the Nostrade family head's daughter.</b>

23:11.510 --> 23:15.910
<b>Has the <i>Nen</i> ability to tell 
others' fortunes via poems.</b>

23:12.940 --> 23:14.170
<b>She likes to collect human trophies.</b>

23:14.170 --> 23:16.080
<b>Her <i>Nen</i> ability is called Lovely Ghostwriter.</b>

23:15.910 --> 23:20.000
<b>The most important member 
of the Nostrade Family.</b>

23:16.080 --> 23:18.320
<b>I would try to tell my own fortune.</b>

23:18.320 --> 23:20.170
<b>But she can't do that.</b>

23:25.420 --> 23:27.720
<b>Next time: Defend x And x Attack!</b>

23:27.720 --> 23:30.720
<b>Hey, Killua, are you better 
at defending or attacking?</b>

23:30.720 --> 23:31.900
<b>What do you think?</b>

23:31.900 --> 23:33.470
<b>Hmm, attacking?</b>

23:33.470 --> 23:34.430
<b>Bingo.</b>
