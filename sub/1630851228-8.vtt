on behalf of

a few years ago.

05:48.086 --> 05:49.436

everything you taught me.

05:51.002 --> 05:52.352
- What do we know?

05:52.395 --> 05:55.355
- The festival was
a counter-cultural event.

05:55.398 --> 05:57.618
Could be a target
for far-right extremists.

05:57.661 --> 05:59.924
Europe has been a hotbed
of activity lately.

05:59.968 --> 06:02.405
- Attacks have been picking up,
and we are seeing all shades,

06:02.449 --> 06:04.625
neo-Nazis, anti-Islamists,
anti-feminists.

06:04.668 --> 06:07.454
- Anyone taking credit yet?
- Nothing on the wires.

06:07.497 --> 06:08.933
- We might be looking
at a lone wolf.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.587

06:10.631 --> 06:12.067
the bombs were placed
where they were?

06:12.110 --> 06:14.765
- HNP's initial investigation

06:14.809 --> 06:18.073
a dozen fatalities clustered
in these two locations.

06:18.116 --> 06:20.597
Visitors from multiple

who were running the event.

06:23.470 --> 06:25.515

private equity company

06:25.559 --> 06:26.821
owns the festival.

06:26.864 --> 06:28.910
- And both locations
were VIP sections.

06:28.953 --> 06:30.607
- Remote detonation?
- Yeah, from a cell phone--

06:30.651 --> 06:31.913
we think.

06:31.956 --> 06:34.132
- VIP section tickets
were over 1,000 euro.

06:34.176 --> 06:35.569
- And most of those
would've gone

06:35.612 --> 06:38.441

- Yeah, likely.

06:38.485 --> 06:40.269
And that's where
your five Americans

06:40.312 --> 06:41.662

with Bartalan Agostan.

07:25.227 --> 07:27.185
This guy was
the American dream.

07:27.229 --> 07:30.232
Born to Hungarian parents
in Pittsburg, Pennsylvania,

07:30.275 --> 07:32.060
he founded Trumantis Capital,

07:32.103 --> 07:33.975
the company that sponsored
the festival,

07:34.018 --> 07:36.804
and grew it into a major player
in international finance.

07:36.847 --> 07:38.327
- He died in the bombing.

07:38.370 --> 07:40.590
- On his company's website,
he says he wanted to bring

07:40.634 --> 07:44.246
the opportunity he'd found in
America back to his motherland.

07:45.726 --> 07:47.118
- Like I thought,

07:47.162 --> 07:48.859
HNP soil sample confirms

07:48.903 --> 07:51.035
meaningful ammonium nitrate
saturation at the park.

07:51.079 --> 07:53.037
It was definitely
an ANFO bomb.

07:53.081 --> 07:55.518
- One of the simplest to make.
- Not so simple

07:55.562 --> 07:57.041
to get your hands
on those materials, though.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.521
- Fuel oil is easy enough,

07:58.565 --> 07:59.870
but sales of ammonium nitrate

07:59.914 --> 08:01.785
are highly regulated in Europe.

08:01.829 --> 08:03.874
- So, if the ammonium nitrate
wasn't purchased,

08:03.918 --> 08:05.528
it had to originate
at the source.

08:05.572 --> 08:08.488
A manufacturing facility,
most likely something local.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.142

08:11.186 --> 08:12.970

manufacturers in Hungary.

08:13.014 --> 08:15.799

after the bomb.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.975
What do you think,
300 square meters of damage?

08:18.019 --> 08:21.152
- It would take 100 kilos
of ammonium nitrate to do it.

08:21.196 --> 08:23.807
- Got some info.
So there are half a dozen

08:23.851 --> 08:26.157

briefly, just to say hello
to some partners,

12:12.906 --> 12:14.864

you and Bartalan were close.

economies of scale

19:40.875 --> 19:42.355

Buda PetroChemical,

19:46.010 --> 19:48.448

Meanwhile, his wife filed for

I didn't date anyone

21:38.949 --> 21:40.734

21:40.777 --> 21:43.345

21:50.657 --> 21:55.401
there is nothing in the world

21:56.706 --> 22:00.797
It's like you have
one foot in and one foot out

22:00.841 --> 22:03.800
before the check comes
on that first date.

22:03.844 --> 22:06.020
You know, you'll be with her,

22:06.063 --> 22:09.719

22:09.763 --> 22:11.417
and you'll be thinking
about the job.

22:11.460 --> 22:12.635
You'll be thinking
about the case,

22:12.679 --> 22:13.984
the next interview.

22:17.553 --> 22:19.512
And there's a distance,
you know, that just...

22:23.646 --> 22:25.822
That's just too wide to cross.

22:27.868 --> 22:29.173
At least it was for me.

22:36.442 --> 22:39.923

22:43.971 --> 22:45.929
I don't know why you want

22:47.409 --> 22:49.019
<i>Kave</i> is his only bad habit.

22:49.063 --> 22:52.371

Elek is a good man,

22:55.548 --> 22:58.115
a good husband,
and a good father.

22:58.159 --> 23:00.727

then why did you leave him?

23:02.424 --> 23:05.558
- How long were you married?
- 16 years.

23:06.689 --> 23:07.864
- So you wake up one day

23:07.908 --> 23:09.562

it's not working out?

23:12.042 --> 23:13.435

23:13.479 --> 23:15.568
- It was me.
I changed.

23:24.794 --> 23:26.535
- These people?

23:26.579 --> 23:27.797
They have families, like you,

23:27.841 --> 23:29.538
and your husband killed them.

23:29.582 --> 23:31.932
Where is he?

23:31.975 --> 23:34.761
Look, if you don't tell us,
he's going to hurt more people.

23:42.595 --> 23:44.597
- When he was given notice
at his job,

23:44.640 --> 23:47.121
he was, of course,
worried about our future.

23:47.164 --> 23:50.124
Money's always an issue.

23:50.167 --> 23:53.562
But we still had each other,
and I thought he would be okay.

23:53.606 --> 23:55.521
But then he went
looking for jobs,

23:55.564 --> 23:58.437
and it was a different world
than 20 years ago.

23:58.480 --> 24:01.962
So I told him,
I could get a job, and I did,

24:02.005 --> 24:03.572
but the money wasn't enough.

24:03.616 --> 24:05.487
So I said we would find
a smaller flat.

24:07.141 --> 24:09.448
That's when he changed.

24:09.491 --> 24:13.495
- Changed how?
- Angry, always angry.

24:13.539 --> 24:15.715
He began to go out
at all hours,

24:15.758 --> 24:17.934
would never tell me
where he was.

24:17.978 --> 24:20.502
So I followed him, and I found

24:20.546 --> 24:22.548
that he was going
to protests and meetings.

24:25.768 --> 24:26.813
- Like this?

24:29.511 --> 24:31.731
- Hungry for Hungarians.

24:40.827 --> 24:42.481
<i>♪</i>

25:11.988 --> 25:13.990
- This was
a brand-new building,

25:14.034 --> 25:16.123
barely finished construction
last month.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.518
Luckily, most of the workers
are still off-site,

25:19.561 --> 25:22.085
which stemmed fatalities.
- Whose building is this?

25:22.129 --> 25:24.218
- It's owned by a British
conglomerate named Quarry.

25:24.261 --> 25:27.003
- Another corporate target.
- Ooh, hold on.

25:27.047 --> 25:30.529
It's the company that's
automating Buda PetroChemical.

25:33.314 --> 25:35.055
- He's targeting everyone

25:35.098 --> 25:36.926
responsible for his circumstances.

25:36.970 --> 25:38.362
- And he still has
enough material

25:38.406 --> 25:40.626
for at least one more bomb.

25:44.151 --> 25:46.370
- I want to know exactly
what had happened to Elek

25:46.414 --> 25:48.285
when he started
attending these rallies.

25:48.329 --> 25:52.028
We get into his psyche,
we figure out his next move.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.552
- Looked into this flyer.

25:53.595 --> 25:55.945
Hungry for Hungarians.
It's a movement started

25:55.989 --> 25:58.600
by a local university
professor, Octavius Varga,

25:58.644 --> 26:01.081
and he's branded himself
as voice of the people.

26:01.124 --> 26:03.910
- This is a conversation on
the Hungarian political forum.

26:03.953 --> 26:06.347
It's between Octavius Varga
and Elek Simko.

26:06.390 --> 26:07.609
Goes back months.

26:07.653 --> 26:09.263
- Does it mention any plans
for an attack?

26:09.306 --> 26:12.353
- No but it's not an argument,
more like teacher and student.

26:12.396 --> 26:14.224
- Maybe when his wife
said Elek changed,

26:14.268 --> 26:16.270
Octavius Varga is the one
who changed him?

26:16.313 --> 26:20.404

26:50.304 --> 26:51.653

26:54.308 --> 26:57.093
We're FBI assisting
the Hungarian national police

26:57.137 --> 26:58.529
on today's bombings.

27:00.314 --> 27:03.012
You wrote a book on
Hungarian patriotism, correct?

27:03.056 --> 27:05.319
- Well, that's a reductive way
to describe it, yes.

27:05.362 --> 27:06.755
- Well honestly,
it was so boring,

27:06.799 --> 27:09.105
I only skimmed it, but
let me see if I got the gist.

27:09.149 --> 27:11.412
In the past, there was order.
A man went to work,

27:11.455 --> 27:14.110
was paid a fair wage,
went home, and fed his family,

27:14.154 --> 27:15.938
but then the Berlin Wall fell

27:15.982 --> 27:17.461
and brought with it

27:17.505 --> 27:19.942
capitalism, chaos,
and criminals.

27:19.986 --> 27:21.248
That sound about right?

27:25.121 --> 27:27.210
The big fish
eat the small fish.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.300
That is what is happening
all across my country.

27:30.344 --> 27:32.563
The imperialists
of the modern age,

27:32.607 --> 27:35.523
these greedy, senseless,
foreign corporations.

27:35.566 --> 27:39.919
They are trying to buy Hungary,
and they must be stopped.

27:39.962 --> 27:41.485
That is my message.

27:41.529 --> 27:44.619
- Yeah, the bombings today
sure spoke that loud and clear.

27:46.403 --> 27:48.405
Do you recognize this man?

27:49.580 --> 27:52.061
- No.
- Elek Simko.

27:52.105 --> 27:53.323
No?

27:53.367 --> 27:55.369
I'm sure you'll remember
this, though.

27:55.412 --> 27:57.980
A four-month-long
online conversation

27:58.024 --> 27:59.503
between the two of you.

27:59.547 --> 28:03.029

thousands.

28:03.072 --> 28:04.334
I inspire them.

28:04.378 --> 28:06.641
I cannot remember
all their names.

28:06.685 --> 28:10.166
- Looks like Elek was
more than just a follower.

28:11.733 --> 28:15.171
Perhaps this person came
to one or two of my protests?

28:15.215 --> 28:17.478
- Maybe we should take him
down to the headquarters.

28:17.521 --> 28:18.914
What do you think?
- Mm.

28:18.958 --> 28:20.568
- Okay.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.527
Okay, yes, I know Elek.

28:23.571 --> 28:25.225
He lost his job.

28:26.617 --> 28:28.097
Told me his story.

The same one I hear
again and again

28:30.230 --> 28:32.711
about how
he had been exploited.

28:32.754 --> 28:36.105
The boot can press down
on a man's neck only so long

28:36.149 --> 28:39.195
before he fights back.
- And gets violent?

28:39.239 --> 28:41.545
- I'm not responsible
if he does.

28:41.589 --> 28:44.113
- Did you tell him
that Trumantis Capital

28:44.157 --> 28:46.333
acquired the company that
fired him and ruined his life?

28:46.376 --> 28:48.248
Did you give him his targets?
- No.

28:48.291 --> 28:50.511
- Oh, you just told
these people that

28:50.554 --> 28:52.992
these foreign companies
must be stopped at any cost.

28:53.035 --> 28:54.384
Did you tell him that too?

28:54.428 --> 28:57.474
- I helped him see
what has been happening to him,

28:57.518 --> 29:00.390
that he is a victim
made to suffer.

29:00.434 --> 29:04.873
I told him it was a shame that
these imperialist corporations

29:04.917 --> 29:07.136
are allowed
to run amok in Hungary

29:07.180 --> 29:10.052
and that someone
should do something about it.

29:10.096 --> 29:12.968
- Hungarians died today
in the bombings,

29:13.012 --> 29:14.361
your countrymen.

29:14.404 --> 29:16.580
Elek is armed
with enough material to blow up

29:16.624 --> 29:19.453
an entire city block
in Budapest at any minute.

29:19.496 --> 29:22.064
So you are going to tell me
everything you know

29:22.108 --> 29:24.806
about who he's targeting next,
right now.

29:26.155 --> 29:28.984
- I don't know that.
I swear it.

29:32.771 --> 29:34.903
- You know,
I see how you operate.

29:34.947 --> 29:37.079
Never get
your hands dirty, huh?

29:38.602 --> 29:41.431
- Every revolution,
there is collateral damage.

29:41.475 --> 29:45.044
These bombings are not on me,
not even on Elek.

29:45.087 --> 29:47.916
They are on those
who are buying my country

29:47.960 --> 29:50.919
and those who are selling it
in the first place.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.489
- First place.

29:56.664 --> 29:58.840
- What?
-

29:58.884 --> 30:00.886
This is personal for Elek.

30:00.929 --> 30:02.888
He's going to the first place
that wronged him,

30:02.931 --> 30:05.760
Buda PetroChemical.
- HNB's already covering it.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.849
- No, Elek's smart.
He's tricky.

30:07.893 --> 30:09.111
You know,
this is his home turf.

30:09.155 --> 30:10.896
He spent 20 years there.
If he slips through

30:10.939 --> 30:13.550
and hits
their ammonium nitrate supply?

30:13.594 --> 30:16.510
- He'd level an entire district
of Budapest.

30:16.553 --> 30:17.859
That's worse than Beirut.

30:17.903 --> 30:20.601
That's a 3.3 Richter scale
earthquake.

30:21.863 --> 30:23.386

at Buda PetroChemical.

- Bill, what happened?
- Oh, God.

31:07.822 --> 31:09.258

31:09.302 --> 31:11.565
He was waiting for me
in the back of the car.

31:11.608 --> 31:14.611
He's mad,

He knew--he knew

to keep it hush hush.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.314

The Grizzly overhead should

38:19.601 --> 38:23.475
Two months ago, Elek won.

38:23.518 --> 38:27.261
Legally, that can be viewed as
material funding of terrorism.
