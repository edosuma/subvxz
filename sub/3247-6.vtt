WEBVTT

00:13.263 --> 00:15.812
There we go. Perfect landing.

00:15.933 --> 00:17.981
Which isn't easy in such a tight spot.

00:18.060 --> 00:20.313
You should be used to tight spots
by now.

00:21.355 --> 00:24.154
- Where are we?
- The end of the line.

00:27.569 --> 00:29.822
No place like it.

00:36.787 --> 00:38.380
Home?

00:38.455 --> 00:41.004
- You took me home?
- Back to the morning after we left.

00:41.124 --> 00:43.877
So you've only been gone
about 12 hours. No time at all, really.

00:43.961 --> 00:47.932
But all the stuff we've done,
Shakespeare, New New York, old New York.

00:48.048 --> 00:50.176
Yep. All in one night.

00:50.259 --> 00:52.603
Relatively speaking,
everything should be just as it was.

00:52.678 --> 00:55.978
Books, CDs, laundry.

00:57.391 --> 01:00.235
So, back where you were, as promised.

01:01.562 --> 01:05.236
- This is it?
- Yeah, I should probably...

01:06.984 --> 01:08.736
Hi I'm out. Leave a message.

01:08.819 --> 01:10.867
I'm sorry.

01:10.946 --> 01:13.620
Martha, are you there?
Pick it up, will you?

01:13.699 --> 01:15.497
It's Mum. It'll wait.

01:15.576 --> 01:18.329
All right, then.
Pretend that you're out if you like.

01:18.495 --> 01:21.374
I was only calling to say
that your sister's on TV.

01:21.456 --> 01:25.211
On the news of all things.
Just thought you might be interested.

01:25.294 --> 01:28.423
- The details are top secret...
- How could Tish end up on the news?

01:28.505 --> 01:30.348
But I can tell you that tonight,

01:30.424 --> 01:32.518
I will demonstrate a device
which will...

01:32.593 --> 01:35.312
She got a new job
doing PR for some research lab.

01:35.387 --> 01:38.766
With the push of a single button,

01:38.849 --> 01:42.899
I will change what it means to be human.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.568
Professor! Professor!

01:45.647 --> 01:48.366
Sorry. You were saying you should...

01:49.568 --> 01:52.037
Yes, yes. I should.

01:53.739 --> 01:57.334
- One trip we said.
- Yeah.

01:57.951 --> 02:00.830
I suppose things just kind of escalated.

02:00.912 --> 02:03.916
Mmm. Seems to happen to me a lot.

02:06.376 --> 02:09.425
Thank you. For everything.

02:10.589 --> 02:12.887
It was my pleasure.

02:50.045 --> 02:54.425
No, I'm sorry. Did he say he was going
to change what it means to be human?

03:32.546 --> 03:34.298
Are you sure it's safe?

03:34.381 --> 03:37.305
There were some issues.
They've been resolved.

03:37.384 --> 03:40.263
I'm confident I'm in no serious danger.

03:40.345 --> 03:44.350
That's comforting, Richard, but it
wasn’t just you I was worried about.

03:44.474 --> 03:45.896
Your concern is touching.

03:45.976 --> 03:48.070
The people in that room will represent

03:48.145 --> 03:50.739
billions of pounds worth
of potential investment.

03:51.314 --> 03:54.534
Mr Saxon wants to be sure
they like what they see.

03:56.027 --> 03:59.657
Don't worry.
Our friend will get his money's worth.

04:02.701 --> 04:05.671
You wanted to see the guest list
for tonight, Professor?

04:05.746 --> 04:07.794
Yes, thank you, Letitia.

04:13.003 --> 04:15.802
That's an interesting perfume.
What's it called?

04:16.882 --> 04:18.555
Soap.

04:24.389 --> 04:26.187
Oh, black tie.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.485
Whenever I wear this,
something bad always happens.

04:28.560 --> 04:31.234
It's not the outfit, that's just you.

04:31.313 --> 04:35.443
Anyway, I think it suits you
in a James Bond kind of way.

04:35.525 --> 04:39.029
James Bond? Really?

05:00.550 --> 05:04.350
Oh, look, they've got nibbles!
I love nibbles.

05:07.474 --> 05:10.398
- Hello!
- Tish!

05:11.102 --> 05:13.400
You look great.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.403
So, what do you think?
Impressive, isn't it?

05:15.565 --> 05:17.567
- Very.
- And two nights out in a row for you.

05:17.651 --> 05:19.494
That's dangerously close
to a social life.

05:19.569 --> 05:21.492
If I keep this up,
I'll end up in all the gossip columns.

05:21.571 --> 05:24.531
You might, actually. You should keep
an eye out for photographers. And Mum.

05:24.574 --> 05:27.077
She's coming, too.
Even dragging Leo along with her.

05:27.160 --> 05:30.630
Leo? In black tie? That I must see.

05:31.998 --> 05:34.342
- This is the Doctor.
- Hello.

05:35.919 --> 05:38.092
- Is he with you?
- Yeah.

05:38.213 --> 05:40.432
But he's not on the list.
How did he get in?

05:40.507 --> 05:42.054
He's my plus one.

05:42.133 --> 05:44.101
So this Lazarus, he's your boss?

05:44.177 --> 05:47.021
Professor Lazarus, yes.
I'm part of his executive staff.

05:47.097 --> 05:48.940
She's in the PR department.

05:49.015 --> 05:51.109
I'm head of the PR department, actually.

05:51.226 --> 05:53.399
- You’re joking!
- I put this whole thing together.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.776
So do you know what the Professor's
going to be doing tonight?

05:55.856 --> 05:59.030
That looks like it might be
a sonic micro-field manipulator.

05:59.109 --> 06:01.612
He's a science geek. I should've known.

06:01.695 --> 06:05.666
Got to get back to work now.
I'll catch up with you later.

06:05.740 --> 06:07.458
Science geek? What's that mean?

06:07.534 --> 06:10.458
That you're obsessively
enthusiastic about it.

06:10.537 --> 06:12.039
Oh. Nice.

06:12.122 --> 06:15.752
Your father's caused me enough
heartache already with his menopause

06:15.834 --> 06:18.633
- and his trophy girlfriend.
- Yeah, Mum, I know.

06:18.712 --> 06:20.760
It was just something
he said last night.

06:20.839 --> 06:23.308
- Martha.
- Mum.

06:24.342 --> 06:25.935
Oh.

06:26.011 --> 06:28.639
All right, what's the occasion?

06:28.722 --> 06:31.521
What do you mean?
I'm just pleased to see you, that's all.

06:31.600 --> 06:36.447
- But you saw me last night.
- I know, I just missed you.

06:37.272 --> 06:38.740
You're looking good, Leo.

06:38.815 --> 06:41.864
Yeah, if anyone asks me to fetch them
a drink, I'll swing for them.

06:41.985 --> 06:44.909
- You disappeared last night.
- I...

06:45.780 --> 06:48.249
- ...just went home.
- On your own?

06:50.493 --> 06:52.837
This is a friend of mine, the Doctor.

06:52.913 --> 06:55.757
- Doctor what?
- No, it's just the Doctor.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.926
- We've been doing some work together.
- All right.

06:58.001 --> 07:00.345
Lovely to meet you, Mrs Jones.
Heard a lot about you.

07:00.420 --> 07:02.718
Have you? What've you heard, then?

07:02.797 --> 07:06.142
Well, you know,
that you're Martha's mother and...

07:08.136 --> 07:09.683
Urn...

07:10.347 --> 07:13.066
No, actually, that's about it.
We haven't had much time to chat.

07:13.141 --> 07:17.647
- You know, been busy.
- Busy? Doing what exactly?

07:17.729 --> 07:21.359
Oh. You know. Stuff.

07:24.027 --> 07:28.453
Ladies and gentlemen,
I am Professor Richard Lazarus,

07:28.531 --> 07:31.876
and tonight I'm going
to perform a miracle.

07:33.036 --> 07:36.381
It is, I believe,
the most important advance

07:36.456 --> 07:39.255
since Rutherford split the atom.

07:39.334 --> 07:43.464
The biggest leap
since Armstrong stood on the moon.

07:44.464 --> 07:47.934
Tonight you will watch and wonder.

07:49.052 --> 07:54.479
But tomorrow, you will wake to a world
which will be changed forever.

08:36.765 --> 08:38.643
Something's wrong. It's overloading.

08:53.742 --> 08:56.962
Somebody stop him!
Get him away from those controls!

08:57.120 --> 09:01.341
If this goes up, it'll take the whole
building with it! Is that what you want?

09:13.470 --> 09:15.643
Get it open.

09:41.331 --> 09:43.174
Ladies and gentlemen.

09:44.167 --> 09:46.169
I am Richard Lazarus.

09:47.212 --> 09:49.340
I am 76 years old

09:50.215 --> 09:52.263
and I am reborn!

09:57.013 --> 10:00.938
He did it. He actually did it!

10:04.854 --> 10:08.779
That can't be the same guy.
It's impossible. It must be a trick.

10:08.858 --> 10:11.702
Oh, it's not a trick. I wish it were.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.039
What just happened, then?

10:15.115 --> 10:18.039
He just changed what it means
to be human.

10:20.537 --> 10:22.380
Excuse me.

10:23.998 --> 10:28.048
That was the most astonishing thing
I've ever seen.

10:29.546 --> 10:33.141
- Look at you!
- This is only the beginning.

10:33.216 --> 10:37.016
We're not just making history,
we're shaping the future, too.

10:37.095 --> 10:39.393
Think of the money we'll make.

10:39.472 --> 10:43.397
People will sell their souls
to be transformed like that.

10:43.893 --> 10:46.521
And I'll be first in line.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.663
- Richard!
- I'm famished.

11:03.621 --> 11:07.421
Energy deficit. Always happens
with this kind of process.

11:07.542 --> 11:09.636
You talk as if
you see this every day, Mr...?

11:09.711 --> 11:13.386
Doctor. And, well, no, not every day,
but I have some experience

11:13.464 --> 11:16.013
- with this kind of transformation.
- That's not possible.

11:16.092 --> 11:18.686
Using hypersonic sound waves
to create a state of resonance,

11:18.761 --> 11:21.731
- that's inspired.
- You understand the theory, then?

11:21.806 --> 11:23.649
Enough to know that
you couldn't possibly

11:23.766 --> 11:25.734
have allowed for all the variables.

11:25.810 --> 11:30.031
- No experiment is entirely without risk.
- That thing nearly exploded.

11:30.106 --> 11:32.074
You might as well
have stepped into a blender.

11:32.150 --> 11:34.528
You're not qualified to comment.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.371
If I hadn't stopped it,
it would've exploded.

11:36.446 --> 11:40.326
Then I thank you, Doctor.
But that's a simple engineering issue.

11:40.450 --> 11:43.499
What happened inside the capsule
was exactly what was supposed to happen.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.122
No more, no less.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.375
You've no way of knowing that
until you've run proper tests.

11:48.458 --> 11:52.713
Look at me! You can see what happened.
I'm all the proof you need.

11:52.795 --> 11:56.891
The device will be properly certified
before we start to operate commercially.

11:56.966 --> 12:00.266
Commercially? You are joking?
That'll cause chaos.

12:00.386 --> 12:03.731
Not chaos, change.

12:03.806 --> 12:06.650
A chance for humanity
to evolve, to improve.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.399
This isn't about improving,

12:08.478 --> 12:11.322
this is about you and your customers
living a little longer.

12:11.397 --> 12:15.277
Not a little longer, Doctor,
a lot longer.

12:15.360 --> 12:16.828
Perhaps indefinitely.

12:16.945 --> 12:21.451
Richard, we have things to discuss.
Upstairs.

12:21.574 --> 12:23.747
Goodbye, Doctor.

12:23.826 --> 12:27.751
In a few years, you'll look back
and laugh at how wrong you were.

12:34.003 --> 12:36.597
Oh, he's out of his depth.

12:36.673 --> 12:38.801
He's no idea the damage
he might've done.

12:38.883 --> 12:42.183
- So what do we do now?
- Now...

12:43.096 --> 12:47.101
Well, this building must be full of
laboratories. I say we do our own tests.

12:47.183 --> 12:50.357
Lucky I've just collected
a DNA sample then, isn't it?

12:50.436 --> 12:54.361
Oh, Martha Jones, you're a star!

12:57.026 --> 13:01.202
I grew up over there.
Tiny flat above a butcher's shop.

13:02.031 --> 13:04.250
It'll have a blue plaque soon.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.541
- "Richard Lazarus lived here."
- It's gone.

13:08.746 --> 13:13.092
- Destroyed in the war. The bombing.
- Of course.

13:14.043 --> 13:16.137
1940. Do you remember?

13:16.879 --> 13:20.349
Night after night. Explosions.

13:22.051 --> 13:25.271
Guns. Firestorms.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.733
My parents had sent me
to the country by then.

13:28.808 --> 13:32.358
When the sirens went,
we'd go to the cathedral there.

13:32.478 --> 13:34.901
We used to shelter in the crypt.

13:35.606 --> 13:38.576
The living cowering among the dead.

13:38.651 --> 13:41.905
But look what you've built here now.

13:41.988 --> 13:45.083
You've laid the foundations
for an empire.

13:45.908 --> 13:49.082
An empire we can rule together.

13:57.003 --> 13:58.505
What's wrong?

14:05.053 --> 14:07.101
Look at yourself, woman.

14:11.559 --> 14:13.857
- Amazing.
- What?

14:13.978 --> 14:17.357
- Lazarus' DNA.
- I can't see anything different.

14:17.440 --> 14:19.943
- Look at it.
- Oh, my God!

14:20.068 --> 14:21.911
Did that just change?

14:22.737 --> 14:25.365
- But it can't have.
- But it did.

14:25.448 --> 14:26.745
It's impossible.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.543
And that's two impossible things
we've seen so far tonight.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.542
Don't you love it when that happens?

14:31.621 --> 14:34.966
That means Lazarus has changed
his own molecular patterns.

14:35.041 --> 14:37.294
Hypersonic sound waves
to destabilise the cell structure.

14:37.377 --> 14:40.257
Then a metagenic program to manipulate
the coding in the protein strands.

14:40.296 --> 14:44.392
Basically, he hacked into his own
genes and instructed them to rejuvenate.

14:44.467 --> 14:48.392
- But they're still mutating now.
- Because he missed something.

14:48.471 --> 14:52.146
Something in his DNA that's been
activated and won't let him stabilise.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.064
Something that's trying to change him.

14:54.143 --> 14:56.566
- Change him into what?
- I don't know.

14:56.646 --> 14:58.819
But I think we need to find out.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.775
That woman said
they were going upstairs.

15:00.858 --> 15:02.326
Let's go.

15:02.985 --> 15:05.704
It's me who made all this possible.

15:05.822 --> 15:08.951
This is my triumph
and I will not be denied.

15:09.033 --> 15:11.081
Not by you.
Not after everything I've done.

15:12.328 --> 15:15.923
You backed me because you saw profit.
Your concern was financial.

15:15.998 --> 15:18.547
You want the money as much as I do.

15:19.335 --> 15:21.463
We had a plan.

15:21.587 --> 15:24.932
When the device is ready,
I'll be rejuvenated, too.

15:25.007 --> 15:28.352
We could be rich and young and together.

15:29.387 --> 15:32.391
You think I'd waste another lifetime
on you?

15:34.851 --> 15:38.321
Did that process make you
even more cruel?

15:39.188 --> 15:44.115
No, my love, that I learned from you.
You have a gift for it.

15:44.193 --> 15:48.289
Then you'll know that I'll protect
my involvement in the project.

15:48.364 --> 15:50.913
I'm sure Mr Saxon will be interested...

15:52.368 --> 15:54.541
What's going on?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.878
It must just be...

15:57.957 --> 15:59.834
What is it?

16:00.793 --> 16:04.218
I'll be fine in a moment.
It's probably just cramp.

16:07.717 --> 16:09.390
Richard?

16:11.471 --> 16:14.099
Is it some kind of seizure?

16:14.223 --> 16:18.729
What should I do?
I don't understand. What's happening?

16:19.729 --> 16:21.151
Richard?

16:36.245 --> 16:40.751
Tish, have you seen Martha
and that Doctor anywhere?

16:40.833 --> 16:42.335
Not since the demonstration.

16:42.418 --> 16:44.887
Do you know anything about him?
Has she ever mentioned him before?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.930
- Not to me.
- The way she followed him...

16:47.006 --> 16:49.179
She's a doctor.
She was just doing her job.

16:49.258 --> 16:53.104
She's not a doctor yet. Never will be
if she doesn't stay focussed.

16:53.221 --> 16:55.724
Look, she's found a bloke. So what?

16:55.806 --> 17:00.277
There's something's going on, Leo.
I can feel it.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.837
Letitia Jones. I'd recognise
the smell of that soap anywhere.

17:21.958 --> 17:23.425
Professor.

17:23.501 --> 17:25.742
I'm sorry, ladies and gentlemen.
You'll have to excuse me

17:25.752 --> 17:29.633
while I take care of Letitia here.
I've been neglecting her.

17:37.807 --> 17:42.153
- This is his office all right.
- So where is he?

17:42.979 --> 17:47.234
Don't know.
Let's try back at the... reception.

17:55.783 --> 17:59.162
- Is that Lady Thaw?
- Used to be.

17:59.829 --> 18:03.834
It's just a shell, had all
the life-energy drained out of her.

18:04.959 --> 18:07.963
Like squeezing the juice
out of an orange.

18:08.045 --> 18:10.218
- Lazarus!
- Could be.

18:10.298 --> 18:13.393
- So he's changed already.
- Not necessarily.

18:13.509 --> 18:16.479
You saw the DNA, it was fluctuating.
The process must demand energy.

18:16.554 --> 18:19.478
- This might not have been enough.
- So he might do this again?

18:19.557 --> 18:20.934
Mmm.

18:27.898 --> 18:30.902
You seem very young to have
such a responsible position.

18:31.027 --> 18:33.951
- Have you much experience?
- Not really.

18:34.030 --> 18:36.671
But the interview panel thought
I had all the necessary attributes.

18:36.699 --> 18:38.747
How perceptive of them.

18:40.077 --> 18:41.954
So, where are you taking me?

18:42.038 --> 18:45.087
Up to the roof. It's a lovely evening.
I thought I'd show you the view.

18:45.166 --> 18:49.091
- It's extraordinary.
- Like a lot of things round here, then.

18:59.221 --> 19:02.065
- I can't see him.
- He can't be far. Keep looking.

19:02.141 --> 19:04.360
You all right, Marth?
I think Mum wants to talk to you.

19:04.435 --> 19:06.108
Have you seen Lazarus anywhere?

19:06.228 --> 19:08.151
He was getting cosy
with Tish a couple of minutes ago.

19:08.230 --> 19:09.903
- With Tish?
- Ah, Doctor.

19:10.024 --> 19:12.652
- Where did they go?
- Upstairs, I think. Why?

19:12.735 --> 19:16.365
- Doctor... I'm speaking to you!
- Not now, Mum!

19:19.033 --> 19:21.661
I think you need one of these.

19:21.744 --> 19:23.997
Thank you. That's very kind of you.

19:25.164 --> 19:30.637
- Do you know that man?
- No. He's a friend of my daughter's.

19:32.129 --> 19:35.599
Perhaps she should choose
her friends more carefully.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.270
Where are they?

19:43.391 --> 19:45.519
The fluctuating DNA
will give off an energy signature.

19:45.601 --> 19:47.695
I might be able to pick it up.

19:49.271 --> 19:51.569
- Got him.
- Where?

19:51.649 --> 19:54.152
But this is the top floor. The roof!

19:55.111 --> 19:58.365
That clock tower is beautiful
all lit up like that.

19:58.447 --> 20:03.123
It's Southwark Cathedral.
One of the oldest churches in London.

20:03.994 --> 20:07.123
Been around even longer than I have.

20:07.206 --> 20:09.834
But you're looking pretty good
for your age.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.669
Thank you.

20:12.962 --> 20:14.964
- Can I?
- Of course.

20:23.681 --> 20:27.902
- I still can't take it in.
- I'm still adjusting myself.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.523
I've been working toward it
for so many years,

20:31.647 --> 20:34.867
it's hard to believe
the moment's finally arrived.

20:34.984 --> 20:37.203
And is it like you expected?

20:38.654 --> 20:42.124
I find that nothing's
ever exactly like you expect.

20:42.783 --> 20:45.662
There's always something
to surprise you.

20:47.329 --> 20:51.084
Between the idea and the reality,
between the motion and the act...

20:51.167 --> 20:53.044
Falls the shadow.

20:54.336 --> 20:57.590
So, the mysterious Doctor
knows his Eliot.

20:57.673 --> 20:59.095
I'm impressed.

20:59.175 --> 21:02.019
- Martha, what are you doing here?
- Tish, get away from him.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.729
What? Don't tell me what to do.

21:03.804 --> 21:05.772
I wouldn't have thought
you had time for poetry, Lazarus.

21:05.848 --> 21:08.647
What with you being so busy defying
the laws of nature and everything.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.319
You're right, Doctor.

21:10.394 --> 21:13.739
One lifetime's been too short for me
to do everything I'd like.

21:13.814 --> 21:17.910
How much more I'll get done
in two or three or four.

21:18.194 --> 21:20.288
It doesn't work like that.

21:20.362 --> 21:24.333
Some people live more in 20 years
than others do in 80.

21:24.408 --> 21:26.877
It's not the time that matters,
it's the person.

21:26.952 --> 21:31.128
But if it's the right person,
what a gift that would be.

21:31.207 --> 21:33.926
Or what a curse.

21:34.001 --> 21:37.175
Look at what you've done to yourself.

21:37.254 --> 21:39.302
Who are you to judge me?

21:39.381 --> 21:41.054
Over here, Tish.

21:41.217 --> 21:42.969
You have to spoil everything, don't you?

21:43.052 --> 21:45.430
Every time I find someone nice,
you have to try and find fault.

21:45.513 --> 21:46.935
Tish, he's a monster!

21:47.014 --> 21:49.974
I know the age thing's a bit freaky,
but it works for Catherine Zeta-Jones.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.202
What is that?

22:05.783 --> 22:07.410
Run!

22:15.835 --> 22:18.133
- Are you okay?
- I was gonna snog him!

22:22.508 --> 22:23.680
Security One.

22:25.386 --> 22:29.357
Security One. Security One.

22:29.682 --> 22:31.901
- What's happening?
- An intrusion.

22:31.976 --> 22:34.775
It triggers a security lockdown.
Kills most of the power.

22:34.895 --> 22:36.943
Stops the lifts, seals the exits.

22:37.022 --> 22:40.026
He must be breaking through that door.

22:40.109 --> 22:41.782
The stairs. Come on!

22:47.324 --> 22:49.702
- He's inside!
- We haven't got much time!

22:52.788 --> 22:54.882
Tish, is there another way out of here?

22:54.957 --> 22:56.755
There's an exit in the corner,
but it'll be locked now.

22:56.834 --> 22:59.212
Martha, setting 54. Hurry.

23:00.629 --> 23:04.259
Listen to me!
You people are in serious danger.

23:04.341 --> 23:06.264
You need to get out of here right now!

23:06.343 --> 23:09.096
Don't be ridiculous. The biggest danger
here is choking on an olive.

23:31.994 --> 23:34.088
Mum, get back!

23:34.163 --> 23:35.460
Leo!

23:36.582 --> 23:40.462
Over here. This way!
Everyone down the stairs now. Hurry!

23:47.968 --> 23:49.811
No! Get away from her!

23:57.186 --> 23:59.439
Leo? Leo?

24:06.445 --> 24:09.119
Lazarus! Leave them alone.

24:10.407 --> 24:13.081
- Martha.
- Come on, stay with me.

24:13.160 --> 24:16.505
What's the point? You can't control it.
The mutation's too strong.

24:16.580 --> 24:20.426
Killing those people won't help you.
You're a fool.

24:21.377 --> 24:24.847
A vain old man
who thought he could defy nature.

24:24.922 --> 24:28.142
Only nature got her own back,
didn't she?

24:28.258 --> 24:30.226
You're a joke, Lazarus!

24:31.387 --> 24:34.516
A footnote in the history of failure!

24:47.403 --> 24:49.531
- What's the Doctor doing?
- He's trying to buy us some time.

24:49.613 --> 24:52.958
Let's not waste it. Leo, look at me.
Focus on me. Let's see your eyes.

24:53.033 --> 24:57.038
Okay, he's got concussion.
Mum, you'll need to help him downstairs.

24:58.497 --> 25:02.468
This'll keep the swelling down.
Go, I'll be right behind you.

25:03.877 --> 25:05.971
Tish, move. We need to get out of here.

25:34.992 --> 25:39.338
It's no good, Doctor.
You can't stop me.

25:39.413 --> 25:40.915
Is that the same arrogance you had

25:40.998 --> 25:43.251
when you swore that nothing
had gone wrong with your device?

25:43.333 --> 25:47.839
The arrogance is yours.
You can't stand in the way of progress.

25:47.963 --> 25:50.967
You call feeding on
innocent people progress?

25:51.800 --> 25:53.643
You're delusional!

25:53.761 --> 25:57.231
It is a necessary sacrifice.

25:57.306 --> 25:59.149
That's not your decision to make.

26:02.728 --> 26:04.651
We can't get out! We're trapped!

26:04.772 --> 26:07.400
There must be an override switch.
Where's the security desk? Tish!

26:07.483 --> 26:09.235
There.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.803
Peek-a-boo.

26:34.009 --> 26:36.011
Oh. Hello.

26:40.849 --> 26:43.944
- I've got to go back.
- You can't.

26:44.019 --> 26:46.192
You saw what that thing did.
It'll kill you.

26:46.313 --> 26:48.486
I don't care. I have to go.

26:49.191 --> 26:51.614
It's that Doctor, isn't it?

26:51.693 --> 26:54.446
That's what's happened to you.
That's why you've changed.

26:54.530 --> 26:56.783
He was biding us time, Martha.

26:56.865 --> 27:00.369
- Time for you to get out, too.
- I'm not leaving him.

27:02.538 --> 27:03.915
Martha!

27:43.078 --> 27:48.255
More hide and seek, Doctor?
How disappointing.

27:53.046 --> 27:57.426
- Why don't you come out and face me?
- Have you looked in the mirror lately?

28:00.012 --> 28:02.265
Why would I want to face that, hmm?

28:17.779 --> 28:19.952
- What are you doing here?
- I'm returning this.

28:20.032 --> 28:21.534
- I thought you might need it.
- How did you...

28:21.617 --> 28:23.210
I heard the explosion.
I guessed it was you.

28:23.285 --> 28:25.708
- I blasted Lazarus.
- Did you kill him?

28:25.787 --> 28:28.381
More sort of annoyed him, I'd say.

28:29.499 --> 28:30.876
She'll be all right.

28:32.211 --> 28:34.805
The Doctor and her,
they'll look out for each other.

28:34.922 --> 28:38.643
She turned her back on us,
went in there with that thing.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.805
- For him.
- He must be some guy.

28:44.014 --> 28:47.393
- Maybe she loves him.
- She just met him.

28:47.476 --> 28:49.774
Is your daughter still in there
with the Doctor?

28:49.853 --> 28:51.526
Do you know him?

28:53.148 --> 28:54.900
He's dangerous.

28:54.983 --> 28:58.487
- There are things you should know.
- What things?

29:06.119 --> 29:08.167
What now?
We’ve just gone round in a circle.

29:08.330 --> 29:10.833
We can't lead him outside.
Come on, get in.

29:13.502 --> 29:16.756
- Are we hiding?
- No, he knows we're here.

29:16.838 --> 29:19.091
But this is his masterpiece.

29:19.174 --> 29:21.927
I'm betting he won't destroy it,
not even to get at us.

29:22.010 --> 29:26.857
- But we're trapped.
- Well, yeah, that is a slight problem.

29:26.974 --> 29:30.274
- You mean you don't have a plan?
- Yes. The plan was to get inside here.

29:30.352 --> 29:32.901
- Then what?
- Well,

29:32.980 --> 29:35.529
then I'd come up with another plan.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.609
In your own time, then.

29:42.781 --> 29:45.500
- Hey!
- Sorry, sorry, sorry.

29:45.575 --> 29:48.545
- Here we are.
- What are you going to do with that?

29:48.620 --> 29:49.997
Improvise.

29:55.877 --> 29:59.472
I still don't understand
where that thing came from. Is it alien?

29:59.548 --> 30:01.471
No. For once,
it's strictly human in origin.

30:01.550 --> 30:03.393
Human? How can it be human?

30:03.510 --> 30:05.512
Probably from dormant genes
in Lazarus' DNA.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.796
The energy field in this thing
must've reactivated them.

30:07.806 --> 30:10.559
- Looks like they're becoming dominant.
- So it's a throwback.

30:10.642 --> 30:13.486
Some option that evolution rejected
for you millions of years ago.

30:13.603 --> 30:16.231
But the potential is still there,
locked away in your genes,

30:16.315 --> 30:19.034
forgotten about until Lazarus
unlocked it by mistake.

30:19.109 --> 30:22.454
- It's like Pandora's box.
- Exactly. Nice shoes, by the way.

30:29.578 --> 30:31.080
Doctor, what's happening?

30:31.204 --> 30:32.805
Sounds like he's switched
the machine on.

30:32.914 --> 30:34.837
- That's not good, is it?
- I was hoping

30:34.916 --> 30:38.136
it was going to take him
a little bit longer to work that out.

30:39.921 --> 30:42.845
- I don't want to hurry you, but...
- I know. Nearly done.

30:42.966 --> 30:44.013
What are you doing?

30:44.092 --> 30:46.436
Trying to set the capsule to
reflect energy rather than receive it.

30:46.511 --> 30:47.558
Will that kill him?

30:47.637 --> 30:49.560
When he transforms,
he's three times the size,

30:49.639 --> 30:52.859
cellular triplication,
so he's spreading himself thin.

30:54.061 --> 30:56.940
- We're going to end up like him!
- Just one more.

31:08.867 --> 31:11.211
I thought we were going to go
through the blender then.

31:11.286 --> 31:14.790
It really shouldn't take that long
just to reverse the polarity.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.296
I must be a bit out of practice.

31:24.132 --> 31:28.729
Oh, God. He seems so human again.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.647
- It's kind of pitiful.
- Eliot saw that, too.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.688
This is the way the world ends.

31:37.771 --> 31:40.149
Not with a bang but a whimper.

32:04.381 --> 32:07.100
She's here. Oh, she's all right.

32:07.175 --> 32:10.145
Oh, Mrs Jones.
We still haven't finished our chat.

32:11.179 --> 32:13.432
Keep away from my daughter.

32:13.515 --> 32:16.610
- Mum, what are you doing?
- Always the mothers. Every time.

32:16.685 --> 32:21.361
- He is dangerous. I've been told things.
- What are you talking about?

32:21.481 --> 32:25.361
Look around you.
Nothing but death and destruction.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.038
This isn't his fault.
He saved us. All of us.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.912
It was Tish who invited everyone
to this thing in the first place

32:31.032 --> 32:33.706
so I'd say, technically, it's her fault.

32:41.126 --> 32:42.969
Leave him.

32:48.008 --> 32:50.636
- Martha?
- Not you, too.

32:52.596 --> 32:54.189
Sorry.

32:58.977 --> 33:02.151
Lazarus, back from the dead.
Should've known really.

33:02.272 --> 33:04.274
Where's he gone?

33:07.527 --> 33:11.407
- That way. The church.
- Cathedral.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.918
It's Southwark Cathedral. He told me.

33:31.092 --> 33:33.436
Do you think he's in here?

33:33.512 --> 33:36.436
Where would you go
if you were looking for sanctuary?

34:09.047 --> 34:10.844
I came here before.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.351
A lifetime ago.

34:14.469 --> 34:19.726
I thought I was going to die then.
In fact, I was sure of it.

34:20.725 --> 34:23.899
I sat here, just a child.

34:25.730 --> 34:28.949
The sound of planes and bombs outside.

34:29.025 --> 34:30.868
The Blitz.

34:32.112 --> 34:34.864
- You've read about it.
- I was there.

34:37.117 --> 34:38.835
You're too young.

34:39.911 --> 34:41.333
So are you.

34:50.380 --> 34:54.760
In the morning the fires had died,
but I was still alive.

34:56.636 --> 34:59.435
I swore I'd never face death
like that again.

35:00.932 --> 35:03.435
So defenceless.

35:05.061 --> 35:09.032
I would arm myself.
Fight back. Defeat it.

35:09.107 --> 35:11.030
That's what you were trying to do today?

35:11.109 --> 35:12.986
That's what I did today.

35:13.069 --> 35:16.869
- What about the other people who died?
- They were nothing.

35:17.616 --> 35:20.961
- I changed the course of history.
- Any of them might've done, too.

35:21.036 --> 35:24.210
You think history's only made
with equations?

35:25.707 --> 35:29.803
Facing death is part of being human.
You can't change that.

35:29.878 --> 35:35.055
No, Doctor.
Avoiding death, that's being human.

35:35.717 --> 35:40.348
It's our strongest impulse, to cling
to life with every fibre of being.

35:40.430 --> 35:44.060
I'm only doing what everyone
before me has tried to do.

35:44.559 --> 35:47.438
I've simply been more successful.

35:49.147 --> 35:51.366
Look at yourself. You're mutating.

35:51.441 --> 35:53.990
You've no control over it.
You call that a success?

35:54.110 --> 35:55.908
I call it progress.

36:00.408 --> 36:02.502
I'm more now than I was.

36:04.746 --> 36:07.169
More than just an ordinary human.

36:07.248 --> 36:09.922
There's no such thing
as an ordinary human.

36:11.503 --> 36:14.347
- He's going to change again any minute.
- I know.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.558
If I could get him up
into the bell tower somehow,

36:16.633 --> 36:19.557
- I've an idea that might work.
- Up there?

36:27.352 --> 36:31.653
You're so sentimental, Doctor.
Maybe you are older than you look.

36:31.731 --> 36:36.077
I'm old enough to know that a longer
life isn't always a better one.

36:36.945 --> 36:39.323
In the end, you just get tired.

36:40.573 --> 36:42.826
Tired of the struggle.

36:42.951 --> 36:46.000
Tired of losing everyone
that matters to you.

36:48.248 --> 36:51.593
Tired of watching everything
turn to dust.

36:53.628 --> 36:56.177
If you live long enough, Lazarus,

36:56.256 --> 36:59.681
the only certainty left
is that you'll end up alone.

37:01.136 --> 37:03.434
That's a price worth paying.

37:05.140 --> 37:06.483
Is it?

37:18.027 --> 37:20.576
I will feed soon.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.749
I'm not going to let that happen.

37:24.367 --> 37:28.338
- You've not been able to stop me so far.
- Leave him, Lazarus.

37:29.330 --> 37:31.583
He's old and bitter.

37:31.666 --> 37:33.839
I thought you had a taste
for fresher meat.

37:33.960 --> 37:35.712
Martha, no.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.671
- What are you doing?
- Keeping you out of trouble.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.892
Doctor, the tower!

37:49.684 --> 37:51.686
Did you hear that?

37:54.522 --> 37:58.117
He's changed again. Keep moving.
We've got to lead him up.

38:02.989 --> 38:04.707
Where are they?

38:06.117 --> 38:07.243
Martha?

38:08.703 --> 38:09.795
Doctor!

38:09.871 --> 38:12.715
Take him to the top, the very top
of the bell tower, do you hear me?

38:12.791 --> 38:14.589
- Up to the top?
- Martha?

38:14.709 --> 38:17.713
- And then what?
- Martha, come on!

38:35.897 --> 38:38.400
Hypersonic sound waves, inspired.

38:45.073 --> 38:46.950
There's nowhere else to go.
We're trapped!

38:47.033 --> 38:48.706
This is where he said to bring him.

38:48.785 --> 38:51.083
Right, so we're not trapped, we're bait.

38:51.204 --> 38:53.548
He knows what he's doing.
We have to trust him.

38:53.665 --> 38:55.417
Ladies.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.432
Stay behind me.

39:02.507 --> 39:04.930
If he takes me, make a run for it.
Head back down the stairs.

39:05.051 --> 39:06.598
- You should have enough time.
- But...

39:06.719 --> 39:08.642
just do it, Tish!

39:12.892 --> 39:15.441
I hope there's a good acoustic in here.

39:30.034 --> 39:31.081
Martha!

39:33.955 --> 39:35.298
Hold on!

39:37.250 --> 39:39.127
Get away from her!

39:47.802 --> 39:49.600
We need to turn this up to 11.

40:16.831 --> 40:18.925
I've got you! Hold on.

40:19.000 --> 40:20.627
Martha!

40:29.594 --> 40:33.064
I'm okay. We're both okay!

40:38.394 --> 40:39.611
Thanks.

40:39.687 --> 40:42.110
It's your Doctor you should be thanking.

40:42.190 --> 40:45.660
- I told you he'd think of something.
- He cut it a bit fine though, didn't he?

40:45.777 --> 40:48.530
He always does. It's more fun that way.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.370
Who is he?

40:53.785 --> 40:55.287
He's...

40:57.747 --> 40:59.875
He's the Doctor.

41:31.656 --> 41:33.454
I didn't know you could play.

41:33.574 --> 41:35.668
Well, you know,
if you hang around with Beethoven,

41:35.743 --> 41:37.544
- you're bound to pick a few things up.
- Mmm.

41:37.578 --> 41:41.583
- Especially about playing loud.
- Sorry?

41:49.215 --> 41:51.309
Something else
that just kind of escalated, then.

41:51.426 --> 41:53.144
I can see a pattern developing.

41:53.261 --> 41:56.310
You should take more care
in the future. And the past.

41:56.431 --> 41:59.526
And whatever other time period
you find yourself in.

41:59.600 --> 42:02.444
- It's been fun, though, hasn't it?
- Yes!

42:02.562 --> 42:05.281
So what do you say? One more trip?

42:09.736 --> 42:11.864
No.

42:11.946 --> 42:13.118
Sorry.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.824
What do you mean?
I thought you liked it.

42:14.907 --> 42:17.831
I do, but I can't go on like this.
"One more trip." It's not fair.

42:17.952 --> 42:19.295
What are you talking about?

42:19.412 --> 42:23.292
I don't want to be a passenger any more,
someone that you take along for a treat.

42:23.374 --> 42:26.469
That's how you still see me.
I'd rather stay here.

42:27.670 --> 42:30.298
Okay, then, if that's what you want.

42:33.468 --> 42:36.563
Right. Well, we've already
said goodbye once today.

42:36.637 --> 42:39.186
It's probably best if you just go.

42:43.561 --> 42:46.360
- What is it?
- Well, I said okay.

42:46.481 --> 42:48.950
- Sorry?
- Okay.

42:50.276 --> 42:52.654
Oh, thank you! Thank you!

42:55.031 --> 42:58.831
Well, you were never really
just a passenger, were you?

43:04.499 --> 43:06.501
Hi I'm out. Leave a message.

43:06.584 --> 43:10.088
Martha, it's your mother.
Please phone me back.

43:10.171 --> 43:13.141
I'm begging you.
I know who this Doctor really is.

43:13.216 --> 43:16.641
I know he '5 dangerous.
You 're going to get yourself killed.

43:16.719 --> 43:21.099
Please trust me. This information comes
from Harold Saxon himself

43:21.182 --> 43:23.184
You 're not safe.

43:28.439 --> 43:30.567
Distress signal. Locking on.

43:30.650 --> 43:33.199
Now that is hot.
If you can't stand the heat...

43:33.945 --> 43:35.868
- The ship's gone mad.
- Who are you?

43:35.988 --> 43:37.035
I'm the Doctor.

43:37.115 --> 43:38.583
Mum, it's me, it's Martha.

43:38.699 --> 43:40.793
Get out of there!

43:40.868 --> 43:42.870
Burn with me.

43:44.622 --> 43:46.499
- I can't stop it!
- That's enough!

43:47.959 --> 43:49.757
Go on, my son.

43:49.877 --> 43:52.551
- That is brilliant.
- I know.

43:52.755 --> 43:55.634
- I'll save you.
- It's your fault.

43:55.716 --> 43:57.889
- What are you?
- Doctor!

43:58.010 --> 43:59.182
We're stuck here.
