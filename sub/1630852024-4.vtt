00:02.586 --> 00:04.254
[door creaks]

00:05.964 --> 00:08.300
Oh. Hello there.

00:08.300 --> 00:09.885
And welcome to Thornhill,

00:09.885 --> 00:12.971
the Blossom family's
ancestral home.

00:12.971 --> 00:15.891
A house
of secrets and mysteries,

00:15.891 --> 00:19.144
and the most haunted place
in Rivervale.

00:19.144 --> 00:21.980
Is it haunted by ghosts
or memories?

00:21.980 --> 00:24.191
Or something else? A curse?

00:25.442 --> 00:26.860
Perhaps all three.

00:26.860 --> 00:28.737
[clock chimes]

00:28.737 --> 00:30.989
Well, would you
look at the time?

00:31.823 --> 00:33.325
It's 7:00 am.

00:33.325 --> 00:35.619
And the women of Thornhill,
past and present,

00:35.619 --> 00:38.914
are waking up
across the decades.

00:38.914 --> 00:40.540
In the here and now,

00:40.540 --> 00:42.459
Cheryl Blossom wakes up
from a dreamless sleep.

00:42.459 --> 00:44.127
-[alarm ringing]
-[Cheryl groans]

00:45.504 --> 00:47.756
[Jughead] As 65 years ago,

00:47.756 --> 00:50.509
Poppy Blossom stirs awake
in the same room,

00:50.509 --> 00:52.344
in the same bed.

00:52.344 --> 00:53.929
And while further back still,

00:53.929 --> 00:56.473
Abigail Blossom opens her eyes
to meet the day.

01:02.729 --> 01:04.690
Three blossom women,

01:04.690 --> 01:07.943
one story
echoing across time,

01:07.943 --> 01:09.987
burning as bright and eternal

01:09.987 --> 01:12.114
as a comet's tail
in the night sky.

01:14.700 --> 01:16.618
[suspenseful music playing]

02:10.756 --> 02:12.424
[knocking at door]

02:19.181 --> 02:20.515
[mouthing]

02:29.816 --> 02:30.942
[knocking at door]

02:43.997 --> 02:45.290
Today, we will
be discussing comets,

02:45.290 --> 02:47.417
in particular, periodic comets.

02:47.417 --> 02:49.378
Bailey's comet passes through

02:49.378 --> 02:51.004
the inner workings
of our solar system

02:51.004 --> 02:53.173
once every 65 years.

02:55.550 --> 02:57.344
Tonight's a momentous night.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.556
You lucky girls will be able
to marvel

03:01.556 --> 03:03.350
at the comet's beauty
on the North hill

03:03.350 --> 03:04.726
as it streaks through
the night sky

03:04.726 --> 03:06.686
and over Rivervale.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.688
-Mm-hmm?
-Mistress Cheryl,

03:08.688 --> 03:10.273
will Nana Blossom be able

03:10.273 --> 03:11.942
to join us
for the viewing tonight?

03:11.942 --> 03:14.820
She's feeling quite weak today,
so I'm afraid not.

03:14.820 --> 03:17.030
And I will not be with you
at the North hill either.

03:17.030 --> 03:18.824
I will be by my Nana's bedside,

03:18.824 --> 03:21.159
conducting certain rituals

03:21.159 --> 03:23.370
to help her transition
into the afterlife.

03:23.370 --> 03:26.206
-I have some good news, Nana.
-[Nana Rose] Oh.

03:26.206 --> 03:27.582
[Cheryl] Tonight's the night
we've been planning

03:27.582 --> 03:29.501
for all these years.

03:29.501 --> 03:31.378
Bailey's comet returns
to our skies.

03:31.378 --> 03:35.841
Oh. You bring me such relief,
dear child.

03:35.841 --> 03:37.175
Now I must ask you again

03:37.175 --> 03:39.386
while you are
in your right mind.

03:39.386 --> 03:41.054
Roseanne Blossom,
are you certain

03:41.054 --> 03:42.556
you wish to continue
down this road?

03:42.556 --> 03:45.976
Once done, it cannot be undone,

03:45.976 --> 03:48.270
and there is risk.

03:50.188 --> 03:52.524
There's always a risk
when spellcasting.

03:52.524 --> 03:57.446
I have never been more certain.

03:57.446 --> 04:00.907
Very well then.
Let's begin with the ritual.

04:02.993 --> 04:04.327
To walk in their shoes,

04:04.327 --> 04:06.788
you must first
know their stories,

04:06.788 --> 04:07.873
their histories.

04:10.083 --> 04:11.168
Who do you wish to begin with?

04:11.168 --> 04:14.296
Both. For their stories,

04:14.296 --> 04:17.716
as you know, are intertwined.

04:17.716 --> 04:19.968
All right. Let's see.

04:20.552 --> 04:22.846
Ah. Yes.

04:22.846 --> 04:26.183
Poppy had just hosted
one of her delightful salons.

04:26.183 --> 04:27.976
Thanks for letting me
stick around

04:27.976 --> 04:30.270
-and bend
your ear alone, Poppy.
-Of course, Tamtam.

04:31.146 --> 04:32.856
And you did seem quiet

04:32.856 --> 04:34.483
during our discussion
of Lady Chatterley's Lover.

04:34.483 --> 04:36.526
Oh, it's so silly, Poppy.

04:36.526 --> 04:38.653
I want to start working
at the diner,

04:38.653 --> 04:40.906
but my husband is
dead set against it.

04:40.906 --> 04:43.158
Home is where I belong,
he says.

04:43.158 --> 04:44.701
But I know I would do

04:44.701 --> 04:46.620
a better job of managing Pop's
than he does.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.122
[Poppy] Hmm.

04:49.122 --> 04:50.373
[sighs]

04:54.252 --> 04:55.670
What's this?

04:55.670 --> 04:57.297
Some herbs from my garden.

04:57.297 --> 04:58.882
Sprinkle them in your hubby's
eggs Benedict

04:58.882 --> 05:02.135
and he will come down
with a nasty stomach bug.

05:02.135 --> 05:03.470
And then you can be the heroine

05:03.470 --> 05:05.055
and step up and run Pop's
for the day.

05:05.055 --> 05:06.264
[chuckles softly]

05:07.098 --> 05:08.850
Oh, Poppy,

05:08.850 --> 05:11.353
I don't know
what we'd do without you.

05:11.353 --> 05:14.064
I see here from your resume
that you have

05:14.064 --> 05:16.691
five years teaching experience.

05:16.691 --> 05:18.485
-Is that right?
-Yes.

05:18.485 --> 05:20.320
When I came across
your hiring announcement

05:20.320 --> 05:23.114
in the paper,
I was moved to apply.

05:23.114 --> 05:25.450
My old school was
shut down, you see,

05:25.450 --> 05:27.994
and turned into a hospital
after the war began.

05:27.994 --> 05:29.329
A wretched affair, isn't it?

05:30.830 --> 05:32.165
My own dear brother James

05:32.165 --> 05:34.584
is fighting
on the western front.

05:34.584 --> 05:38.004
Tell me, the pox is rampant
throughout our land,

05:38.004 --> 05:39.089
have you been afflicted by it?

05:39.089 --> 05:41.466
Yes, when I was but a babe.

05:41.466 --> 05:43.969
I too survived
that hellish plague.

05:46.638 --> 05:47.472
Are you married?

05:52.561 --> 05:55.397
-No, ma'am.
-Good.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.816
I have no need
for women with husbands.

06:03.238 --> 06:04.906
You're hired.

06:04.906 --> 06:07.200
Is it Thomasina or Miss Topaz?
Which do you prefer?

06:07.200 --> 06:08.243
Thomasina.

06:08.243 --> 06:10.036
Very good.

06:10.036 --> 06:12.998
-Where did you say
you were from again?
-Nearby.

06:12.998 --> 06:13.915
Greendale.

06:18.753 --> 06:19.963
[swishing]

06:37.230 --> 06:38.815
Today, ladies,

06:38.815 --> 06:40.900
we shall be discussing
proper table etiquette,

06:40.900 --> 06:43.403
especially in regards
to shared plates

06:43.403 --> 06:44.779
and clear soups.

06:44.779 --> 06:46.531
Actually, Ms. Blossom,

06:46.531 --> 06:48.283
I had a notion
about today's lesson.

06:49.993 --> 06:52.454
Bailey's comet is set
to pass over Rivervale

06:52.454 --> 06:54.247
in a few days' time,

06:54.247 --> 06:55.624
and it offers an excellent

06:55.624 --> 06:57.584
scientific opportunity
for the girls.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.211
Firstly, Thomasina,
it is quite unladylike

07:00.211 --> 07:01.838
to be traipsing
around the woods after dark.

07:03.006 --> 07:04.758
But, more importantly,

07:04.758 --> 07:07.302
the Thornhill Academy for Girls
is a finishing school.

07:07.302 --> 07:10.597
But a comet,
like any celestial body,

07:10.597 --> 07:13.183
is fundamental
to the understanding
of our lives.

07:13.183 --> 07:16.603
It's much like a poem, you see.

07:16.603 --> 07:20.565
Everything, the stars, time,
and even you and I,

07:20.565 --> 07:22.817
we're all part of
an intertwining cosmic fabric.

07:23.652 --> 07:26.363
I see.

07:26.363 --> 07:29.407
And I suppose next you'll be
wanting to teach my girls
other similarly

07:29.407 --> 07:31.284
impolite topics
from the world of men.

07:31.284 --> 07:32.661
Indeed, I will.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.538
Because men have all the power,

07:35.538 --> 07:37.165
and the world
need not be that way.

07:37.165 --> 07:39.292
That's quite enough
of that talk, Thomasina.

07:39.292 --> 07:41.544
So long as you teach
at my school, you will
follow my curriculum.

07:42.837 --> 07:45.590
Class dismissed.

07:45.590 --> 07:48.593
All right, ladies, if you could
please take your seats.

07:50.970 --> 07:53.056
So, for this week's salon,
I was thinking

07:53.056 --> 07:54.933
maybe we discuss
Bailey's Comet,

07:54.933 --> 07:56.976
which I just read
will be passing over

07:56.976 --> 07:58.978
our little town
later this year.

07:58.978 --> 08:00.855
What do we think?

08:00.855 --> 08:03.400
We should have a viewing party,
set up on the roof of Pop's.

08:03.400 --> 08:06.027
[Bitsy]
That's a swell idea, Tammy.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.779
Though I can't imagine
Jack would be

08:07.779 --> 08:09.823
very interested in a comet.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.533
[Tammy] Oh, by the way, Poppy,

08:11.533 --> 08:14.369
guess who's working the diner's
register these days.

08:14.369 --> 08:16.162
Curious timing, this comet.

08:17.831 --> 08:19.958
Didn't the Soviets
just launch Sputnik?

08:19.958 --> 08:21.793
Wait, is that the missile
I keep hearing about?

08:21.793 --> 08:24.379
It's the Russian
space satellite, Velma,

08:24.379 --> 08:26.631
for spying on us Americans.

08:26.631 --> 08:27.716
You're absolutely right, Bitsy.

08:27.716 --> 08:29.175
Can they really do that?

08:29.175 --> 08:30.593
Oh, by the way, did you hear?

08:30.593 --> 08:33.346
Wendy Weatherbee
was just arrested

08:33.346 --> 08:34.514
for conspiracy.

08:34.514 --> 08:36.266
-No.
-Yes.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.518
Wendy is
as red-blooded American
as the rest of us.

08:38.518 --> 08:40.812
Well, apparently now
she's just red.

08:40.812 --> 08:42.105
My question is,

08:42.105 --> 08:44.190
are our children safe
at school?

08:44.190 --> 08:47.819
Ladies, ladies,
no need to fret.

08:47.819 --> 08:51.239
My opinion is,
if people discuss their

08:51.239 --> 08:54.075
different ideas in the privacy
of their own homes,

08:54.075 --> 08:55.535
well, what's the harm?

08:55.535 --> 08:58.204
Poppy Seed Blossom,
do you really mean that?

08:58.204 --> 08:59.122
I truly do.

08:59.706 --> 09:01.249
[sighs]

09:01.249 --> 09:04.252
I suppose I'm just not a fan
of witch hunts.

09:04.252 --> 09:05.170
Of any kind.

09:08.590 --> 09:10.717
Thank you for letting me
stay behind, Poppy.

09:10.717 --> 09:13.052
I promise I won't take up
too much of your time.

09:13.052 --> 09:15.013
Oh pooh, Bitsy,

09:15.013 --> 09:16.222
time spent with you

09:16.222 --> 09:17.932
is always
the highlight of my week.

09:20.185 --> 09:21.394
But what's going on?

09:23.313 --> 09:25.732
The truth is, I'm not happy
in my marriage, Poppy.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.276
I've wondered.

09:28.276 --> 09:30.779
Jack thinks the answer
is to have another child.

09:32.781 --> 09:35.325
Even though my first pregnancy
was... [sighs]

09:36.868 --> 09:38.912
Well, you remember
how hard that was on me.

09:38.912 --> 09:41.623
Have you considered divorce?

09:41.623 --> 09:44.667
Divorce? Jack?

09:44.667 --> 09:47.712
No, I couldn't, Poppy.
Jack's Catholic.

09:47.712 --> 09:51.216
Well, maybe it's just about
not getting pregnant right now.

09:51.216 --> 09:54.552
Have you ever
looked into birth control?

09:54.552 --> 09:56.429
Oh, I couldn't
possibly ask Dr. Curdle

09:56.429 --> 09:59.808
-for something like that.
-Not to worry.

09:59.808 --> 10:01.893
I have just the thing.

10:05.730 --> 10:07.857
Take this special ginger root
from my garden.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.818
A few flakes
every day in the morning

10:09.818 --> 10:11.402
will make sure you don't start

10:11.402 --> 10:13.071
baking a bun in the oven.

10:14.239 --> 10:16.741
[sighing] Poppy...

10:16.741 --> 10:19.494
I'm so grateful to you
for listening

10:19.494 --> 10:21.746
and understanding.
What would I do without you?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.821
Oh, my.
What the devil am I doing?

10:54.821 --> 10:56.865
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Poppy.

10:56.865 --> 10:58.700
Oh, Bitsy, Bitsy,
everything's fine.

10:58.700 --> 10:59.742
Nothing bad happened.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.203
Everything will work out.

11:03.079 --> 11:05.039
You'll see. Okay?

11:05.039 --> 11:06.291
Okay. Okay.

11:14.799 --> 11:15.800
[Abigail] Thomasina.

11:17.051 --> 11:18.761
-[Thomasina] Yes.
-[Abigail sighs]

11:20.138 --> 11:20.972
I...

11:22.682 --> 11:26.686
I wanted to apologize
for my outburst earlier.

11:26.686 --> 11:29.772
I'm afraid I should be
the one to apologize.

11:29.772 --> 11:32.108
After all, it is
your curriculum, not mine.

11:32.901 --> 11:34.319
True. But...

11:35.987 --> 11:38.031
after some quiet reflection,

11:38.031 --> 11:40.783
I've realized you're right.

11:40.783 --> 11:43.828
From now on, we're going
to teach these young women

11:43.828 --> 11:45.330
hard truths,

11:45.330 --> 11:47.081
tough knowledge.

11:47.081 --> 11:50.001
Prepare them for a world
that might not exist yet,

11:50.001 --> 11:53.796
-but someday will.
-Yes, Abigail.

11:53.796 --> 11:55.131
What can I do to help?

11:57.926 --> 12:02.305
♪ I'm gonna drive you
Through the night ♪

12:02.305 --> 12:07.477

12:24.160 --> 12:26.871
Velma, I am so sorry.

12:26.871 --> 12:28.539
You were telling me
about your husband.

12:28.539 --> 12:31.876
Yes. It's just that...

12:31.876 --> 12:34.003
lately, things have
been a bit...

12:35.672 --> 12:38.466
-vanilla in the bedroom.
-Hmm.

12:38.466 --> 12:42.470
And I want to spice things up
a bit with the mister.

12:42.470 --> 12:47.600
But I don't know
how to, exactly.

12:47.600 --> 12:49.394
Hmm. Well,

12:49.394 --> 12:53.231
I have got some spice for you.

12:56.067 --> 12:57.402
The Kama-sutra.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.112
[Poppy]
Oh, it's the bee's knees.

12:59.112 --> 13:00.321
Oh, also.

13:02.407 --> 13:03.533
What's this?

13:03.533 --> 13:06.327
My own special aphrodisiac mix.

13:06.327 --> 13:09.831
Sprinkle that
into his roast beef and...

13:09.831 --> 13:11.708
he'll never want
to leave your bed.

13:12.583 --> 13:13.835
[Thomasina sighs]

13:15.086 --> 13:16.129
Abigail,

13:17.088 --> 13:19.465
why didn't you wake me?

13:19.465 --> 13:22.260
Because you are so beautiful
when you sleep.

13:24.095 --> 13:25.847
Thomasina,

13:25.847 --> 13:27.473
how I wish we can live in this

13:27.473 --> 13:29.684
little perfect world
of ours forever.

13:30.893 --> 13:32.937
[knocking at door]

13:33.813 --> 13:35.732
Who could that be?

13:35.732 --> 13:37.734
Only trouble comes knocking
at this hour.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.153
[loud knocking]

13:40.153 --> 13:41.654
[man] Abigail Blossom, open up.

13:41.654 --> 13:42.947
I'm here on official business.

13:46.159 --> 13:48.036
Constable Keller,
state your business, sir.

13:48.036 --> 13:49.370
[Kirk] I'm looking
for a murderess.

13:49.370 --> 13:51.247
The harlot's name
is Thomasina Topaz.

13:58.212 --> 14:01.215
There's no one here
by that name. Now, please go.

14:02.133 --> 14:03.426
For your own good.

14:03.426 --> 14:05.386
We have a confirmed case
of the pox here.

14:05.386 --> 14:07.055
There's a plague
upon this house.

14:07.055 --> 14:08.598
[coughs]

14:08.598 --> 14:10.600
[footsteps receding]

14:13.144 --> 14:14.353
Thomasina Topaz,

14:14.353 --> 14:15.772
I would have the truth
from you.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.030
[loud knocking]

14:28.201 --> 14:29.494
Don't say a word.

14:31.537 --> 14:33.623
I know what you did
with my wife.

14:33.623 --> 14:34.957
I beg your pardon.

14:34.957 --> 14:36.250
Don't you play coy
with me, Poppy.

14:37.251 --> 14:38.878
Well, go on, tell her.

14:41.589 --> 14:44.425
I might have given you
the wrong idea about us, Poppy.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.929
I've never been happier
in my marriage.

14:47.929 --> 14:49.222
And I would be very lucky

14:49.222 --> 14:50.264
to have another child
with Jack.

14:51.933 --> 14:53.601
So just butt out, okay?

14:56.270 --> 14:57.105
You hear that?

15:02.276 --> 15:03.444
Keep out of my marriage, woman.

15:03.444 --> 15:05.404
And so help me,

15:05.404 --> 15:08.032
if you get anywhere
near Bitsy again,

15:08.032 --> 15:09.158
I will kill you.

15:16.374 --> 15:17.416
[Abigail sobs]

15:25.800 --> 15:27.969
Why did Constable Keller
call you a murderess?

15:29.595 --> 15:32.598
When I came seeking employment,

15:32.598 --> 15:35.434
you asked if I had a husband.

15:35.434 --> 15:37.353
I said I did not,
which is true.

15:40.857 --> 15:41.941
But once I did.

15:43.734 --> 15:45.528
It was an arranged marriage.

15:49.574 --> 15:52.076
He was a cruel man.

15:54.495 --> 15:59.417
He didn't like my ideas
of educating womenkind.

15:59.417 --> 16:01.460
He didn't like my rituals.

16:01.460 --> 16:04.213
He just sought to control me

16:04.213 --> 16:07.300
with the back of his hand
and his belt.

16:08.259 --> 16:10.678
Men are such monsters.

16:10.678 --> 16:11.512
[Thomasina] One night...

16:13.014 --> 16:14.849
I saw a look in his eyes...

16:16.350 --> 16:18.644
and I knew it was
either his life or mine.

16:22.523 --> 16:23.900
So I choose mine.

16:25.693 --> 16:26.944
I chose to live.

16:31.991 --> 16:33.034
Stay here.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.456
Stay with me forever.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.546
[Britta] Mistress Cheryl,
may I come in?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.215
[Cheryl] Britannia?

16:47.215 --> 16:49.258
What are you doing here?
And where are the other girls?

16:49.258 --> 16:51.385
They left.

16:51.385 --> 16:52.845
To see the comet
from the North hill.

16:52.845 --> 16:55.264
And why, pray tell,
aren't you with him?

16:55.264 --> 16:57.725
Please, Mistress Cheryl.

16:58.392 --> 16:59.560
I notice things.

16:59.560 --> 17:00.978
I know you and Nana Rose

17:00.978 --> 17:03.481
have been planning something
in secret.

17:05.524 --> 17:07.026
I just don't know what it is.

17:08.819 --> 17:10.154
But I'd like to be here for it.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.489
[Nana Blossom] Oh.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.367
Let the child stay.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.160
Oh. Very well then,
you can stay.

17:16.160 --> 17:21.374
But not a word out of you.
Pull up a chair.

17:21.374 --> 17:23.834
I was just about to tell Nana
what happened to poor Poppy.

17:27.129 --> 17:30.841
♪ Feel guilty
When you kissed me ♪

17:30.841 --> 17:35.263
♪ Last night... ♪

17:35.263 --> 17:37.932
[knocking at door]

17:40.518 --> 17:41.394
Well, hello, boys.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.814
Excuse me. This is my home!

17:46.399 --> 17:48.401
Who the hell
do you think you are,

17:48.401 --> 17:50.611
telling our wives
we can't satisfy them?

17:50.611 --> 17:52.321
I see.

17:52.321 --> 17:55.157
So that's why none
of your wives came today.

17:55.157 --> 17:56.784
You bullied them
into submission.

17:58.452 --> 18:00.329
Pathetic, if you ask me.

18:00.329 --> 18:01.789
Well, we're not asking you.

18:01.789 --> 18:05.710
In fact, we want you
to leave Rivervale ASAP.

18:05.710 --> 18:08.087
The Blossoms have
outstayed their welcome here.

18:10.256 --> 18:11.549
And if I don't leave?

18:13.801 --> 18:15.761
Don't push us on this, Poppy.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.305
You know what I do
for a living.

18:17.305 --> 18:20.474
Kirk Keller,
Thornhill is my home.

18:20.474 --> 18:21.392
I'll never leave it.

18:21.392 --> 18:23.936
Okay, suit yourself.

18:23.936 --> 18:24.895
But don't say
we didn't warn you.

18:36.324 --> 18:38.993
[knocking at door]

18:43.914 --> 18:45.541
Who is it? Who's there?

18:45.541 --> 18:47.585
My name's Fen Fogarty, ma'am.

18:47.585 --> 18:50.546
I'm a friend of your brother's.
I come with news of him.

18:52.757 --> 18:54.425
Mr. Fogarty,

18:54.425 --> 18:56.635
come in and warm yourself
by the fire.

19:01.891 --> 19:02.892
-Welcome.
-Yeah.

19:11.359 --> 19:13.235
Miss Blossom,

19:13.235 --> 19:15.654
it is my sad duty to inform you
that your dear brother James

19:15.654 --> 19:17.448
was killed
during our last battle.

19:18.949 --> 19:22.661
He gave me this letter
to give to you,

19:22.661 --> 19:23.913
right before he passed.

19:29.251 --> 19:31.295
"In the midst
of this brutal war,

19:32.338 --> 19:36.384
it is my dying wish

19:36.384 --> 19:40.346
that you,
my beloved sister, Abigail,

19:40.346 --> 19:44.392
would take the hand
of my dearest friend,

19:44.392 --> 19:45.726
Fen Fogarty...

19:47.103 --> 19:48.187
in marriage."

19:49.480 --> 19:50.773
"Dearest friend."

19:51.565 --> 19:52.817
How intimately

19:52.817 --> 19:54.485
did you and James
know one another?

19:54.485 --> 19:57.738
War makes all men bedfellows.

20:01.450 --> 20:04.745
Abigail, you cannot marry
this man, this stranger.

20:04.745 --> 20:07.039
Thomasina,
you don't understand.

20:07.039 --> 20:10.751
My brother was my twin,
my soul mate.

20:10.751 --> 20:14.296
If this was his dying wish,
I must honor it.

20:14.296 --> 20:16.340
There is a darkness in Fen.

20:16.340 --> 20:18.092
I do not know what,
but I have a sixth sense

20:18.092 --> 20:19.718
about these things.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.096
And my intuition tells me
he means you harm.

20:22.096 --> 20:23.556
Nonsense.

20:23.556 --> 20:24.932
He was my brother's confidant.

20:24.932 --> 20:27.601
Letters can be forged.

20:27.601 --> 20:30.604
Tomorrow, when he goes hunting,
we will search his room

20:30.604 --> 20:33.441
for proof
of his true intentions.

20:33.441 --> 20:35.651
I'm certain that man
is not who he says he is.

20:38.404 --> 20:39.738
I will not let

20:39.738 --> 20:42.032
any harm come to you.
I swear it.

20:52.084 --> 20:53.711
Hello, Tammy.

20:53.711 --> 20:55.754
It's nice
to see you working here.

20:55.754 --> 20:57.756
I'll have my usual, please.

20:57.756 --> 21:00.509
A patty melt with
a side of coleslaw
and a glass of buttermilk.

21:00.509 --> 21:04.221
Do you maybe want that
to go, Poppy?

21:11.687 --> 21:14.773
No. I'd like to eat it here.

21:14.773 --> 21:15.608
Thank you very much.

21:16.775 --> 21:17.693
Fine.

22:01.737 --> 22:03.531
What's the meaning of this?

22:03.531 --> 22:04.823
What are you doing here, Kirk?

22:04.823 --> 22:06.825
We've received an anonymous tip

22:06.825 --> 22:09.161
that you, Miss Blossom,
are a subversive.

22:09.161 --> 22:11.330
A suspected
communist sympathizer.

22:11.330 --> 22:13.457
That's an outrageous lie,
and you know it.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.917
Is it?

22:14.917 --> 22:17.253
What about
the closed-door meetings

22:17.253 --> 22:18.837
you've been coercing

22:18.837 --> 22:20.548
the unsuspecting wives
of Rivervale to attend?

22:22.508 --> 22:24.593
What are you doing? Those are
my precious heirlooms.

22:24.593 --> 22:26.136
You've left us no choice.

22:26.136 --> 22:27.513
I'm sorry, Poppy.

22:27.513 --> 22:28.847
We're taking you in
for questioning.

22:30.975 --> 22:33.143
[Abigail] What, pray tell,
are we looking for?

22:33.143 --> 22:34.812
[Thomasina]
Evidence of his malfeasance.

22:42.361 --> 22:44.280
[Abigail] This isn't
my brother's hand.

22:44.280 --> 22:46.574
This is someone practicing
my brother's hand.

22:50.703 --> 22:52.955
My family seal.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.040
This is the official
Blossom crest.

22:56.458 --> 22:58.877
Thomasina, I think
you were right.

22:58.877 --> 23:00.546
The betrothal letter
was forged.

23:00.546 --> 23:02.798
Which means you don't have
to marry that imposter.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.055
Objects of the occult.

23:12.266 --> 23:16.061
I knew he was
trafficking in the dark arts.

23:16.061 --> 23:19.440
Abigail, I'm afraid
it's worse than I feared.

23:19.440 --> 23:21.400
Fen Fogarty
is not just a scoundrel,

23:22.401 --> 23:23.235
he's a warlock.

23:24.194 --> 23:25.988
What?

23:25.988 --> 23:28.324
But how could you know that?

23:28.324 --> 23:29.950
I have knowledge
about these things.

23:40.210 --> 23:41.587
Heaven protect us.

23:46.925 --> 23:48.802
These are
death portraits, Thomasina.

23:49.887 --> 23:50.971
I think he's a murderer.

23:58.270 --> 23:59.271
My lord.

24:00.939 --> 24:03.108
I think he murdered
my brother James.

24:03.108 --> 24:04.902
Women, I'm back with supper.

24:25.172 --> 24:27.091
What the devil
are you two doing in here?

24:27.091 --> 24:28.717
Be gone from my house
this instant.

24:28.717 --> 24:31.970
You do not
give me orders, woman.

24:31.970 --> 24:33.722
Once we are married,
I will become

24:33.722 --> 24:35.057
the Lord of this manor.

24:35.057 --> 24:37.309
-Will you now?
-Abigail, get back!

24:37.309 --> 24:38.602
-Stop!
-[Fen grunts]

24:39.395 --> 24:40.896
Do it, you devil!

24:40.896 --> 24:43.065
Obey me or I slit her throat
where she stands.

24:43.982 --> 24:46.026
Fen, please.

24:47.486 --> 24:50.030
I'll marry you, Fen.
I'll marry you.

24:50.030 --> 24:51.073
Good.

24:51.949 --> 24:52.991
Yes.

24:54.034 --> 24:56.870
We'll do it tonight. Legally.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.205
Properly.

24:59.039 --> 25:00.624
We'll need a vicar then,

25:00.624 --> 25:02.543
to perform the ceremony
and bear witness.

25:02.543 --> 25:04.545
You'll have to fetch one
in town.

25:04.545 --> 25:07.798
Oh, no, you'll go fetch him.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.508
If I leave,
you two will collude

25:09.508 --> 25:10.759
to kill me
and run off together.

25:12.136 --> 25:13.512
I'll lock

25:13.512 --> 25:16.348
this saucy sapphic wench
in the chapel

25:16.348 --> 25:18.809
if you're not back
within an hour with the vicar!

25:20.769 --> 25:21.812
I'll kill her.

25:25.566 --> 25:27.067
All right.

25:27.067 --> 25:28.485
[Kirk] All you have to do
is cooperate.

25:28.485 --> 25:30.070
We know you're a communist.

25:30.070 --> 25:31.780
Just admit it so I can
let you out of here.

25:31.780 --> 25:33.782
I won't admit to a lie.

25:33.782 --> 25:35.033
I haven't done anything wrong.

25:35.033 --> 25:36.869
Is it true
you once visited Russia?

25:36.869 --> 25:38.245
Yes.

25:38.245 --> 25:40.372
To participate
in a chess tournament.

25:40.372 --> 25:43.542
Are you loyal to this country?

25:43.542 --> 25:45.502
This government? The flag?

25:45.502 --> 25:49.006
Yes, yes and yes.

25:49.006 --> 25:50.632
Are you against God, religion?

25:50.632 --> 25:52.593
I'm against witch hunts
and group think.

25:54.011 --> 25:57.306
And yet,
you organize gatherings,

25:57.306 --> 25:59.183
unsegregated I might add,

25:59.183 --> 26:00.768
where you read banned books.

26:00.768 --> 26:02.853
Is it true
you use contraceptives?

26:02.853 --> 26:04.188
What is it you really want
from me?

26:08.817 --> 26:12.237
Admit you're a commie,
sign the confession,

26:12.237 --> 26:14.615
or I will put you in jail
to rot.

26:15.532 --> 26:16.575
Do what you want.

26:17.993 --> 26:19.369
I'm not signing anything.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.553
She wanted more than anything

39:48.553 --> 39:50.555
to be reunited with her.

39:51.931 --> 39:53.224
[Sabrina] The only way
to do that

39:53.224 --> 39:54.767
was to move her soul
into a body

39:54.767 --> 39:56.936
no longer meant to be
in this world.

39:58.229 --> 40:01.566
And tonight,
that's what we did.

40:01.566 --> 40:04.736
The soul that once inhabited
this body,

40:04.736 --> 40:06.529
Abigail's soul,

40:06.529 --> 40:12.410
has moved on
to a peaceful eternity

40:12.410 --> 40:14.954
in the sweet hereafter.

40:14.954 --> 40:17.582
And now, I, Roseanne Blossom,

40:17.582 --> 40:21.544
can once again
enjoy my precious youth.

40:21.544 --> 40:26.633
And Cheryl, Poppy, Abigail...

40:26.633 --> 40:28.468
-she's really dead?
-No.

40:29.886 --> 40:30.720
No.

40:32.180 --> 40:33.848
There is no death for witches.

40:35.016 --> 40:36.351
Only transformation.

40:37.935 --> 40:39.979
I mean, I died and came back.

40:40.813 --> 40:42.065
Abigail was a witch?

40:42.607 --> 40:44.108
She was.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.110
As was Thomasina.

40:46.110 --> 40:49.238
Which we can
definitely talk you through.

40:49.238 --> 40:51.532
But how about we do it over
a milk shake at Pop's?

Sabrina Spellman,

visiting Rivervale
from the neighboring township
of Greendale,

41:42.417 --> 41:44.585
summed it up perfectly.

41:44.585 --> 41:46.170
Happy-sad endings
