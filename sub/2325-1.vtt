WEBVTT

01:09.969 --> 01:12.037
Which one are you going for, bud?

01:13.306 --> 01:16.074
The white one? With goggles?

01:21.214 --> 01:24.683
Okay, I'm gonna show you
how to get there. Okay?

01:28.488 --> 01:31.222
Okay, you're gonna follow...

01:32.458 --> 01:35.326
this line till it gets to...

01:36.229 --> 01:39.199
Till it gets to this circle, okay?

01:39.200 --> 01:41.834
When it hits that circle,
you press the button.

01:41.835 --> 01:46.839
Then you're gonna follow this bottom
line until it gets to this circle.

01:46.840 --> 01:49.375
Then you press the
button, okay? Got it?

01:49.376 --> 01:51.878
Okay, you got any money?

01:51.879 --> 01:54.379
Okay, well, here's $1.

01:55.848 --> 01:57.849
Good luck.

05:22.422 --> 05:24.388
Hey.

05:27.093 --> 05:31.162
Nomad's back. He's
messing with us again.

05:39.972 --> 05:41.673
What did he say?

05:42.942 --> 05:48.112
"Your hack into MIT
servers was legit."

05:50.784 --> 05:52.283
That was fast.

05:52.718 --> 05:55.721
"Ta, ta, ta." What is that?

05:56.722 --> 06:00.827
"They put that shit on us.
"We almost got expelled."

06:09.969 --> 06:12.036
"Vibes."

06:12.805 --> 06:16.176
Who's this Vibes? Okay, guy.

06:16.677 --> 06:19.145
"We're going to expose
you at DEF CON,

06:19.146 --> 06:21.813
"so you better watch your back."

06:26.418 --> 06:28.619
Dude, what is that?

06:32.792 --> 06:34.826
What the...

06:48.040 --> 06:50.575
<i>Go into the building.</i>

06:55.681 --> 06:57.650
Get the Pwnie.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.685
All right, let's do this.

06:59.686 --> 07:01.854
Open up a Linux terminal
and start an Nmap, dude.

07:01.855 --> 07:03.689
Haley's gonna have
to drive tomorrow.

07:03.690 --> 07:05.024
Hey, focus.

07:05.025 --> 07:06.893
That's what I'm saying,
I won't be able to.

07:06.894 --> 07:10.630
Technically she's the one moving, so
technically she should be driving.

07:10.631 --> 07:13.765
- Is it open yet?
- In a sec.

07:14.166 --> 07:15.900
- Okay, I'm good.
- Okay.

07:22.909 --> 07:24.210
Okay, type something.

07:24.211 --> 07:26.745
I'm trying to think
of something funny.

07:26.746 --> 07:28.214
Damn.

07:28.215 --> 07:32.450
"Do androids take
an electric sheet?"

07:33.452 --> 07:35.519
You're stupid.

07:36.422 --> 07:39.325
Okay, read me out the
IPs on the C&C servers.

07:39.326 --> 07:44.764
"192. 236. 19. 147."

07:44.765 --> 07:46.766
147. Start sniffing connections.

07:46.767 --> 07:49.934
Copy that. Firing up the listeners.

07:50.369 --> 07:52.436
All right, this guy's toast.

07:56.776 --> 07:58.678
Nevada.

07:58.679 --> 08:01.478
Dude, we're going
right through Nevada.

08:02.214 --> 08:04.749
- We got him.
- We got him!

08:10.957 --> 08:13.424
Are you guys being
serious right now?

08:16.295 --> 08:19.430
Well, you're driving
in the morning, so...

08:19.532 --> 08:21.299
good night.

08:23.235 --> 08:28.172
I'd like to see you make
me, you Caltech turncoat.

08:46.325 --> 08:48.427
Haley, this fish tank's
leaking something.

08:48.428 --> 08:49.962
It's water, Jonah.

08:49.963 --> 08:52.263
- It's gross.
- Shut up.

08:52.598 --> 08:56.901
- You Caltech turncoats.
- Dude, can you stop saying that?

09:00.873 --> 09:04.110
- Signal sucks out here.
- You're right, it does suck.

09:04.211 --> 09:06.451
- Hey, you want one of these?
- No, I'm good, thanks.

09:06.452 --> 09:08.219
You want?

09:15.688 --> 09:17.521
Dude.

09:19.525 --> 09:22.526
- What?
- Check this out.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.764
What the hell?
Why isn't that working?

09:28.200 --> 09:29.301
Is that my car?

09:29.302 --> 09:32.805
- Yeah. It's a traffic camera.
- This guy is so gnarly.

09:32.806 --> 09:35.508
- How does he have a picture of my car?
- Hold on a sec.

09:35.509 --> 09:38.678
Why would this guy go to all
the trouble to hack into MIT,

09:38.679 --> 09:41.013
and then, you know,
just taunt us like this?

09:41.014 --> 09:43.683
The same reason anyone does
anything. Acknowledgment.

09:43.684 --> 09:45.451
"I'm better than you, you're
better than me," whatever.

09:45.452 --> 09:48.186
Here, dude, I can't
unlock it. You try.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.526
You guys should just
stop provoking him.

09:56.562 --> 10:00.597
He's probably just some little kid.

10:01.200 --> 10:05.738
- Nic, are we doing this or not?
- I can't, dude.

10:05.739 --> 10:07.705
What do you mean, you can't?

10:10.576 --> 10:13.345
I just can't right now.

10:13.346 --> 10:16.913
Look, I get we have to
take Haley to California.

10:17.383 --> 10:20.586
But there's no reason we
shouldn't do this, too.

10:20.587 --> 10:24.857
Nomad hacking into MIT is one
thing, but Haley's computer?

10:24.858 --> 10:27.693
No, but it's crazy not
to go after this guy.

10:27.694 --> 10:29.195
- Jonah, what's the sales tax?
- We're so close.

10:29.196 --> 10:33.365
6.3. It's on the way.

10:33.366 --> 10:36.567
$14.74. You can keep the change.

11:14.406 --> 11:17.108
- You guys want something?
- Yeah.

11:18.477 --> 11:20.980
- Coffee?
- Yeah, I'd love a coffee.

11:20.981 --> 11:24.682
- Black?
- There you go. Yeah, please.

11:38.731 --> 11:40.164
What?

11:42.234 --> 11:45.769
Has Nic said anything
to you about me moving?

11:46.071 --> 11:48.072
No.

11:49.175 --> 11:51.076
Nothing?

11:51.077 --> 11:55.246
No, obviously he's bummed you're
gonna be gone for a year.

12:01.153 --> 12:04.790
It just seems like he's trying to
distance himself from me, you know?

12:04.791 --> 12:08.092
Look, you guys are my best friends,

12:09.028 --> 12:11.263
and I'm just...

12:11.264 --> 12:13.397
I'm the wrongest guy to ask.

12:17.102 --> 12:18.769
Yeah.

12:20.840 --> 12:22.840
Oh, crap.

12:24.877 --> 12:26.544
Hey.

12:27.713 --> 12:29.947
You all right, bud?

12:30.216 --> 12:31.617
- I'm fine.
- Yeah?

12:31.618 --> 12:33.851
I'm fine, I'm fine.

12:34.186 --> 12:36.253
I'm gonna get more coffees.

12:42.695 --> 12:45.529
I'm gonna... move the car.

13:02.147 --> 13:04.415
Best friends!

13:07.586 --> 13:09.389
Is this one mine?

13:09.415 --> 13:12.915
Yeah. I already put two in.

13:14.060 --> 13:16.727
- Here you go.
- I got it.

13:20.499 --> 13:23.269
Nic, I offer to help not
because I think you need it,

13:23.270 --> 13:25.537
but because I know you don't.

13:25.538 --> 13:29.640
Yeah, well, you won't have to
worry about that soon, will you?

13:32.211 --> 13:34.011
Okay.

13:43.289 --> 13:45.522
Thanks, bud.

13:46.959 --> 13:50.262
We're not really that far
from this guy, are we?

13:50.263 --> 13:53.430
180 miles, give or take.

13:55.701 --> 13:58.034
All right, dude, let's do it.

13:58.237 --> 14:00.406
Let's go.

14:00.407 --> 14:03.275
Now, see, this is the
Nicholas Eastman I love.

14:03.276 --> 14:07.277
You know, just determined,
ruthless, competitive.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.946
Oh, and favors caffeine.

14:13.052 --> 14:15.185
Where's Haley?

14:16.055 --> 14:19.022
I don't know. I think
she walked, uh...

14:20.659 --> 14:22.493
That way.

14:43.482 --> 14:47.520
Haley, look, I'm sorry. It's
just, I've been distracted.

14:47.521 --> 14:49.588
I think you're getting ready
to make a big speech.

14:49.589 --> 14:52.992
I think this whole trip is about
you getting ready to make it.

14:52.993 --> 14:56.660
What are you talking about?
I'm not gonna make a speech.

14:56.662 --> 14:58.762
Stop.

15:15.481 --> 15:19.885
Haley, you know how many times
I've played this out in my head?

15:19.886 --> 15:22.721
Twice-a-week doctor's appointments.

15:22.722 --> 15:28.660
Who knows how many MRis and
tests. Eventually a wheelchair.

15:28.661 --> 15:30.529
All the time wondering if
you're gonna break up with me.

15:30.530 --> 15:32.297
- Stop.
- When you're gonna get tired of this...

15:32.298 --> 15:33.444
It's not fair to
make me the bad guy

15:33.446 --> 15:35.534
- without my input.
- Haley, that's not what I'm saying.

15:35.535 --> 15:39.070
I'm just saying I'm not gonna
be the guy who holds you back.

15:43.475 --> 15:46.277
Cool. So, uh...

15:46.979 --> 15:50.046
I move away for one year and...

15:50.249 --> 15:53.552
because you're scared
of what's gonna happen,

15:53.553 --> 15:56.820
you immediately resort
to breaking up?

15:56.889 --> 15:59.700
I'm just saying...
I'm just saying...

15:59.702 --> 16:02.694
- I need to protect myself.
- From what?

16:04.029 --> 16:07.631
- Is it your heart talking or your head?
- It's me talking.

16:08.400 --> 16:12.538
But you're the one that always told me to
run toward something and not away from it.

16:12.539 --> 16:15.639
Yeah, well, that was
before all this shit.

16:29.721 --> 16:31.822
What are you doing?

16:37.096 --> 16:40.431
You can keep your promises.
I don't want them.

16:50.809 --> 16:52.743
Haley.

16:56.748 --> 17:01.351
You just take a left up here.
It's about 20 miles or so.

17:01.720 --> 17:04.156
Maybe we should drop
Haley off first.

17:04.156 --> 17:07.191
Can you not talk about
me like I'm not in the car?

17:10.662 --> 17:13.195
Haley, you don't
have to come along.

17:13.265 --> 17:15.866
No, I wanna meet this asshole.

17:16.234 --> 17:18.135
Me, too.

17:29.815 --> 17:33.450
Just keep going. We still
got, like, a quarter mile.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.775
- Stop, stop, we passed it.
- What?

17:56.776 --> 17:58.375
Yeah, back up.

18:08.920 --> 18:11.454
Say, 20 or 30 feet.

18:11.823 --> 18:14.024
Stop, stop.

18:16.396 --> 18:19.296
- I think it's right here.
- You serious?

18:19.731 --> 18:22.134
It's right here. It's right here.

18:24.704 --> 18:28.505
- Don't get us stuck. Please, Nic.
- We're fine.

18:28.674 --> 18:30.708
It's over here.

18:35.814 --> 18:37.894
You should kill the headlights.

18:39.818 --> 18:41.186
Are you sure you want to do this?

18:41.187 --> 18:45.489
I'm not gonna lie.
This doesn't look right.

18:45.691 --> 18:48.025
What do you think?

18:50.495 --> 18:53.899
We're not gonna know
by sitting in the car.

18:53.900 --> 18:57.034
Come on, let's go. Get your camera.

18:58.036 --> 19:01.004
Haley, stay in and
lock the doors, okay?

19:02.107 --> 19:03.807
Nic.

19:04.243 --> 19:06.944
You know all this is stupid, right?

19:15.053 --> 19:18.023
- Where do you think we went wrong?
- What are you talking about?

19:18.024 --> 19:21.126
You know, it must have been,
like, a random IP allocation.

19:21.127 --> 19:23.562
Like, they could be in
Georgia for all we know.

19:23.563 --> 19:27.297
- Like, Europe Georgia.
- Shut up.

19:31.436 --> 19:34.772
Or they could be using
this as a relay point.

19:37.042 --> 19:39.910
A big mama sat in that chair.

19:46.285 --> 19:49.453
I'm gonna have to say
there's nobody here, Nic.

19:58.797 --> 19:59.998
Dude, Nomad is not here.

19:59.999 --> 20:02.067
- Let's take a look.
- He's not here.

20:02.068 --> 20:04.770
We'll take a look
and then we'll go.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.072
Let's go find him.

20:07.073 --> 20:09.506
A hillbilly lives here.

20:11.109 --> 20:14.011
- This guy has a baby?
- Shh!

20:18.917 --> 20:20.350
Shh!

20:48.447 --> 20:50.214
Jonah?

20:53.285 --> 20:54.985
Jonah?

21:04.329 --> 21:06.096
Jonah?

21:07.065 --> 21:09.534
Dude, I can see you.
What are you doing?

21:09.535 --> 21:11.201
Hey!

21:17.577 --> 21:20.143
Dude, you're such an asshole!

21:21.813 --> 21:24.383
How funny is this little chair?

21:24.384 --> 21:26.918
It was really facing
the corner like this.

21:26.919 --> 21:29.419
Come on. There's a basement.

21:30.923 --> 21:33.556
You're such a kike.

21:36.561 --> 21:40.764
- Go down.
- Screw that, you go down.

21:42.768 --> 21:44.534
Be careful.

21:57.182 --> 21:59.416
What is this place?

22:02.187 --> 22:04.321
Check it out, man.

22:07.459 --> 22:09.459
What are those?

22:09.561 --> 22:13.163
- Server racks.
- That's weird.

22:20.238 --> 22:22.272
Oh, wait. Haley!

22:23.575 --> 22:26.677
Haley! Haley! Haley!

22:28.813 --> 22:30.780
Haley!

22:36.121 --> 22:37.656
What the hell?

22:38.991 --> 22:40.592
- What was that sound?
- I don't know.

22:40.593 --> 22:43.962
- Why are the car doors open like that?
- I don't know!

22:43.963 --> 22:45.729
Haley!

22:53.572 --> 22:55.672
- Haley!
- Shh!

22:55.874 --> 22:57.907
Listen.

23:06.451 --> 23:07.752
Oh, my God.

23:08.988 --> 23:11.221
- Haley!
- Haley!

23:11.590 --> 23:13.556
Haley!

24:55.527 --> 24:58.861
Can you... speak?

25:00.131 --> 25:02.466
Where am I?

25:03.735 --> 25:05.869
I can't move.

25:07.405 --> 25:09.505
Can you tell me your name?

25:10.875 --> 25:13.211
Nicholas Eastman.

25:13.212 --> 25:15.580
I'm Damon. Dr. Wallace Damon.

25:15.581 --> 25:20.051
I'm heading up the transition
team that's going to help you,

25:20.052 --> 25:25.989
help all of us understand exactly
what you've been through.

25:26.458 --> 25:29.192
What are you talking about?

25:30.395 --> 25:34.798
Can you recall for me the first
time you encountered the signal?

25:35.066 --> 25:36.967
The what?

25:39.337 --> 25:41.638
Why can't I move?

25:42.774 --> 25:44.342
What happened to us?

25:44.343 --> 25:47.579
Due to the circumstances
surrounding your condition,

25:47.580 --> 25:53.116
I'm afraid that our information
is... extremely limited.

25:53.184 --> 25:55.787
Wait, what's my condition?

25:55.788 --> 26:00.189
What I'm about to tell you, Nic,
you may find a bit disturbing.

26:00.859 --> 26:04.761
You have made contact
with an E.B.E.

26:05.363 --> 26:07.265
E.B.E.?

26:07.266 --> 26:12.202
Extraterrestrial Biological
Entity. E.B.E.

26:14.873 --> 26:17.474
I want to talk to my parents.

26:20.011 --> 26:23.948
- I'm sorry, that's just not possible.
- What are you talking about?

26:23.949 --> 26:28.919
Where's Haley and Jonah?
What happened to us?

26:29.988 --> 26:33.423
Why am I... in a wheelchair?

26:38.129 --> 26:40.331
Why...

26:40.332 --> 26:42.632
Why are you wearing that suit?

26:44.369 --> 26:48.907
We're not 100% certain about
what we're dealing with here.

26:48.908 --> 26:53.478
The possibility for alien
contamination is... very real.

26:53.479 --> 26:56.112
When you say "alien
contamination," do you mean...

26:56.114 --> 27:00.041
microbiological
contamination, as in foreign?

27:00.218 --> 27:02.085
Hold still.

27:19.738 --> 27:21.238
Oh.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.910
It's just blood.

27:28.880 --> 27:31.113
<i>It's just blood.</i>

27:33.418 --> 27:36.419
I think we'll stop here for today.

28:48.092 --> 28:51.784
<i>Contact values at 9, 8,</i>

28:51.785 --> 28:56.032
<i>47, 91, 72.</i>

29:01.539 --> 29:04.707
<i>Level 12. Do we know current value?</i>

29:39.077 --> 29:43.091
Stop! Will you stop? Stop!

29:43.092 --> 29:46.649
Go back! Can you go back?

29:56.361 --> 29:58.628
What's wrong with Haley?

30:01.165 --> 30:04.369
As advanced as we are,

30:04.370 --> 30:10.973
it's amazing that a tool as crude
as a pen still has its place.

30:13.111 --> 30:15.311
There we go.

30:16.447 --> 30:20.650
I want to talk to Haley. Please.

30:21.519 --> 30:24.120
I'm afraid that's not
possible right now.

30:24.122 --> 30:25.690
Why?

30:25.691 --> 30:27.993
She's in good hands,
Nic, I promise you.

30:27.994 --> 30:30.962
The best thing you can do for
her right now is to help us.

30:30.963 --> 30:34.697
Now, will you please try
to cooperate with me?

30:38.536 --> 30:40.870
- Okay.
- Good.

30:42.807 --> 30:47.043
First I'm going to ask you
some simple control questions.

30:47.545 --> 30:51.013
Do you have 10 toes?

30:55.954 --> 30:57.854
Yes.

31:00.992 --> 31:03.693
Are you from Earth?

31:08.433 --> 31:12.702
- Yes, I am from Earth.
- Good, thank you.

31:13.905 --> 31:16.507
Now, this signal that you and
your friends were pursuing,

31:16.508 --> 31:18.109
when did you first encounter it?

31:18.110 --> 31:20.744
- You mean Nomad.
- Yes.

31:20.745 --> 31:23.780
MIT. He got into our
school's security network

31:23.786 --> 31:27.883
and ruined some major servers,
including our personal ones.

31:33.191 --> 31:36.192
Nic, I want you to watch something.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.540
<i>A big mama sat in that chair.</i>

32:18.536 --> 32:21.704
You definitely weren't
pursuing a hacker.

32:44.228 --> 32:46.062
Hey.

32:51.035 --> 32:52.902
Hey.

32:54.372 --> 32:57.873
- Jonah?
- Nic.

32:57.909 --> 33:01.176
- Jonah!
- Nic!

33:01.612 --> 33:03.281
Oh, my God! Jonah, where are you?

33:03.282 --> 33:06.517
I don't know. I'm locked
up, I'm in a room.

33:06.518 --> 33:10.254
Me, too. I'm in a locked room,
dude. Where are we?

33:10.255 --> 33:14.392
I heard them say we're not allowed above
ground because we were contaminated.

33:14.393 --> 33:17.328
What the hell was Nomad?
What have they told you?

33:17.329 --> 33:19.230
Not much.

33:19.231 --> 33:23.301
I saw Haley. She's in
a coma or something.

33:23.302 --> 33:27.503
Nic, they're doing some
weird shit here, man.

33:27.538 --> 33:30.273
My body doesn't feel right.

33:30.942 --> 33:34.112
- Nic, I gotta go.
- What? Where?

33:34.113 --> 33:38.549
This place is run like a clock.
I can't believe you're in the vent!

33:38.550 --> 33:40.718
What? Dude, I'm not in the vent.

33:40.719 --> 33:44.788
I'm not in the vent! Jonah! Jonah!

33:48.793 --> 33:52.763
- Why don't you have any clocks that work?
- Clocks that work?

33:52.764 --> 33:54.599
Yeah. The one in the
hallway is stuck at 12:30.

33:54.600 --> 33:57.435
- Which hallway?
- Seven windows back. Left turn.

33:57.436 --> 33:59.203
Four windows. Right turn.
Two windows on the right.

33:59.204 --> 34:03.302
Next to the bathroom with its sign
upside down. It's stuck at 12:30.

34:03.305 --> 34:09.246
Nic, it's a broken clock. Thank you
for bringing it to my attention.

34:09.248 --> 34:13.581
Can we please proceed with
the shapes and colors?

34:13.618 --> 34:17.059
- Screw this. This is stupid.
- What's the matter, Nic?

34:17.060 --> 34:19.422
- Can't you do it?
- No, I choose not to do it.

34:19.424 --> 34:24.462
Choose? You choose not to do it?
That sounds like pride talking.

34:24.463 --> 34:27.563
False and foolish pride. That's all.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.873
Pyramid, yellow.

34:36.875 --> 34:39.976
- And the...
- Cube, blue. Sphere, green.

34:39.978 --> 34:42.681
The blue tile here that says "Zero"
corresponds with the green cube.

34:42.681 --> 34:44.782
The yellow tile here that says
"Six" goes with the cube.

34:44.783 --> 34:47.318
The green tile here that says "Five"
goes with the yellow pyramid.

34:47.319 --> 34:49.420
The green cube goes with
the blue shaped cube.

34:49.420 --> 34:51.255
The yellow written sphere goes
with the green-shaped sphere.

34:51.255 --> 34:53.391
The blue written pyramid goes
with the yellow-shaped pyramid.

34:53.391 --> 34:55.025
"Blue," written in yellow,
"yellow," in green,

34:55.027 --> 34:57.094
correspond the visible colors and
shapes rather than the written words

34:57.096 --> 34:59.964
because the spectral quality of light
is more objective, so to speak,

34:59.965 --> 35:03.032
than the written English
words of those colors.

35:04.669 --> 35:07.905
- I see.
- You see? What do you mean, you see?

35:07.906 --> 35:10.241
You, Nic.

35:10.242 --> 35:14.011
I see you and I think I'm beginning to
understand something more about you.

35:14.012 --> 35:16.079
Understand what?

35:17.048 --> 35:19.751
The colors, the shapes,
they have an effect on you.

35:19.752 --> 35:22.019
I'd say it was an emotional
effect, wouldn't you?

35:22.020 --> 35:24.645
I don't care about the shapes and
colors, they don't mean anything to me.

35:24.646 --> 35:28.591
They don't mean shit to me! You're the
one that's infuriating me, you quack!

35:29.694 --> 35:31.561
"Quack."

35:32.096 --> 35:33.730
"Quack."

35:34.265 --> 35:37.302
I wanna see Haley

35:37.503 --> 35:41.104
and I'm not gonna say another
word until you let me see her.

35:43.374 --> 35:45.641
Okay, Nic.

35:54.252 --> 35:55.886
There's nothing on here.

35:55.887 --> 35:59.421
She's in a coma, Nic.

35:59.523 --> 36:03.159
There's nothing that can
be done for her right now.

36:03.928 --> 36:08.032
I promise, as soon as she wakes up,
you'll be the first one to see her.

36:08.033 --> 36:11.601
Right now we're doing
everything humanly possible.

36:50.408 --> 36:52.810
<i>Nic, this place is insane.</i>

36:52.811 --> 36:55.246
Yeah, I know. Listen.
You were right.

36:55.247 --> 36:59.083
This place is run like a clock.
Listen, I need your help.

36:59.084 --> 37:00.918
I've been keeping some
event sequences...

37:00.919 --> 37:04.021
Nic, it was hard to put
all this together,

37:04.022 --> 37:07.258
but, you know, I think
we're sick, or infected.

37:07.259 --> 37:10.194
Hey, Jonah, stop thinking
like that, man. Seriously.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.264
No, they're trying to keep whatever's
inside us from metastasizing.

37:13.265 --> 37:16.767
Jonah, stop. Nothing's
metastasizing, okay?

37:16.768 --> 37:18.636
- We're fine. We're gonna be fine.
- No, I'm not.

37:18.637 --> 37:21.504
- Just trust me on this.
- No, my body is not.

37:22.606 --> 37:24.940
We gotta get out of here.

37:25.609 --> 37:28.179
Yeah, I know. We will.

37:28.180 --> 37:30.481
Okay, I've got the
variables on my keypad.

37:30.482 --> 37:33.150
Now I need you to take back
half the sequences, okay?

37:33.151 --> 37:35.619
- Yeah. I'll help.
- Okay.

37:35.620 --> 37:39.991
- But my glasses are messed up, though.
- Hey, it's gonna be fine.

37:39.992 --> 37:43.627
It's gonna be fine. Don't
worry about your glasses.

37:43.628 --> 37:45.062
Okay, I'm gonna give
it to you spatially.

37:45.063 --> 37:47.797
Three v three phone style.
Okay, you ready?

37:47.798 --> 37:50.234
- Yeah.
- Okay.

37:50.235 --> 37:56.005
Top-middle, middle-middle,
top-left, bottom-left.

37:56.006 --> 37:58.976
- 2-5-1-7.
- You got it?

37:58.977 --> 38:00.845
Bottom-left first.

38:00.846 --> 38:05.581
Middle-middle second.
Top-middle third.

38:06.050 --> 38:08.450
Top-left last.

38:11.589 --> 38:14.592
Nic, I'm having a hard
time handling this.

38:14.593 --> 38:17.728
They made me drink some
weird stuff the other day

38:17.729 --> 38:21.096
and I haven't really been
able to feel my arms.

38:22.366 --> 38:26.535
Your arms? What? What do you mean?

38:26.537 --> 38:28.506
Oh, God!

38:31.342 --> 38:34.178
- Dude, who is it?
- I gotta go.

38:34.179 --> 38:36.679
Jonah, hold on a second.

38:37.715 --> 38:41.016
Jonah! Jonah!

38:41.519 --> 38:43.352
Jonah!

39:13.484 --> 39:15.651
Agitate.

39:46.451 --> 39:48.417
<i>Everybody outside.</i>

39:49.186 --> 39:53.524
<i>Recovery team to level 14.
Subject has breached.</i>

39:53.525 --> 39:55.825
<i>Subject has escaped.</i>

40:09.106 --> 40:12.643
Oh, sorry, I was just looking
for the water fountain.

40:25.523 --> 40:28.190
<i>Recovery team to level 14.</i>

40:29.360 --> 40:32.428
<i>Subject has breached. Escaped.</i>

40:52.983 --> 40:55.453
<i>Can you raise your arm?</i>

40:55.454 --> 40:57.919
<i>What happened in the hallway?</i>

41:03.861 --> 41:05.761
Good.

41:05.996 --> 41:08.265
Still no feeling in your legs?

41:08.266 --> 41:11.102
What happened to Jonah?

41:11.603 --> 41:14.672
Look, I know you guys know I
can talk to him through the vent.

41:14.673 --> 41:16.340
What the hell did you
guys do with him?

41:16.341 --> 41:18.842
Yes, Nic, we have been
listening to you,

41:18.843 --> 41:21.471
- but the truth of the matter...
- The truth of the matter is,

41:21.472 --> 41:23.247
total Mickey Mouse operation here.

41:23.248 --> 41:26.984
Antiquated methodologies,
dinosaurs with government grants.

41:26.985 --> 41:29.620
A whole facility built during
the first wave of Big Science

41:29.621 --> 41:33.357
outdated but allowed to continue
pretending that you're important.

41:33.358 --> 41:35.526
- I feel sorry for you. It's pathetic.
- Nic.

41:35.527 --> 41:38.160
"The truth of the matter."

41:38.529 --> 41:40.631
What is the truth
of the matter here?

41:40.632 --> 41:44.034
The only thing I know for certain is that
you don't know what you're dealing with.

41:44.035 --> 41:47.605
You will be pulled from this shitty little
shack you call a research facility so fast

41:47.606 --> 41:49.773
that the only thing relevant
to be shown for any of this

41:49.774 --> 41:51.842
is the way it's all exposed,
wrecked, and forgotten.

41:51.843 --> 41:54.845
You have no idea!
You have no clue! Do you?

41:54.846 --> 41:57.440
Have any clue how fast dumb,
lost little kids like me,

41:57.442 --> 41:59.526
Jonah or Nomad could
ruin a place like this?

41:59.551 --> 42:02.219
Have it come to a grinding halt
like the stone wheel it is?

42:02.220 --> 42:04.188
You're clueless law in
the Wild West, Damon.

42:04.189 --> 42:08.258
You're a relic protecting
ruins. You're pathetic.

42:08.259 --> 42:12.262
The truth of the matter is, I'm the
only one with any sense around here.

42:16.800 --> 42:19.368
Your friend Jonah...

42:20.638 --> 42:21.972
was never here, Nic.

42:21.973 --> 42:25.774
- We never recovered him.
- Bullshit!

42:26.076 --> 42:28.846
I've been talking to him through
the vent this whole time.

42:28.847 --> 42:31.012
Have you really?

42:32.583 --> 42:35.317
Through your vent, Nic?

43:50.527 --> 43:55.064
Three, four, five, six, seven...

44:07.845 --> 44:10.078
Shit.

44:58.662 --> 45:00.796
Shit!

45:15.279 --> 45:17.012
God damn it!

46:56.446 --> 46:58.747
Nic.

47:06.890 --> 47:08.991
Hey.

47:10.961 --> 47:13.294
How are you feeling?

47:13.964 --> 47:16.331
Better.

47:40.958 --> 47:43.892
I had a wonderful dream.

47:44.227 --> 47:46.728
Oh, yeah?

47:47.230 --> 47:49.631
You, um...

47:50.834 --> 47:53.034
You...

47:54.771 --> 47:58.006
You won your regionals.

48:03.447 --> 48:07.416
Hay, wake up. Wake up.

48:07.417 --> 48:09.584
Haley.

48:12.422 --> 48:14.791
Stop it, get off of me!
Get off of me!

48:14.792 --> 48:18.896
What the hell are you doing? Let go
of me! Haley! Haley, wake up!

48:18.897 --> 48:21.465
Hey, let go of me! Stop it! What
the hell do you think you're doing?

48:21.466 --> 48:24.833
Haley, wake up! Haley! Wake up!

48:44.354 --> 48:46.855
Holy... Holy...

49:00.303 --> 49:03.405
No! What the hell?

49:05.275 --> 49:07.210
Damon!

49:07.211 --> 49:09.646
<i>What did they do to my legs?</i>

49:53.290 --> 49:58.827
Nic, we are going to
need you to calm down.

50:00.397 --> 50:05.402
<i>Now you understand why we've
been so interested in you.</i>

50:05.403 --> 50:09.705
<i>As you can see, your
circumstances are very peculiar.</i>

50:12.976 --> 50:16.611
And believe me, we didn't
want to shock you with this.

51:13.170 --> 51:18.542
I'm sure by now you can appreciate
where we're coming from.

51:18.543 --> 51:22.712
<i>Now, for your safety and ours,</i>

51:22.713 --> 51:28.451
I'm going to need you to
hook yourself up to that IV.

51:28.452 --> 51:30.518
Right over there.

52:04.688 --> 52:06.723
Nic.

52:06.724 --> 52:09.357
I need you...

52:09.893 --> 52:12.394
to calm down.

52:24.340 --> 52:26.240
<i>Nic.</i>

53:38.815 --> 53:40.482
Nic.

53:45.455 --> 53:47.622
Don't do this.

53:48.992 --> 53:50.827
Why...

53:50.828 --> 53:52.796
Why didn't you tell me
what happened to my legs?

53:52.797 --> 53:56.599
How could we? We had
just recovered you.

53:56.600 --> 53:58.969
Now listen to me.

53:58.970 --> 54:04.339
It is extremely dangerous
for you up there.

54:04.874 --> 54:09.612
I can only safeguard you
from them down here.

54:09.613 --> 54:11.879
Safeguard me from who?

55:42.905 --> 55:46.808
You okay? Can you feel your legs?

55:47.710 --> 55:49.778
Come on, we gotta move.

55:49.813 --> 55:51.646
We gotta move.

55:52.982 --> 55:55.285
You okay?

55:55.286 --> 55:57.752
- What's happening?
- Come on, let's go.

56:38.394 --> 56:41.831
I'm sorry to interrupt, but do you know
how long it is until the gas station?

56:41.832 --> 56:45.502
Hmm? Oh, it's just up a ways.

56:45.503 --> 56:50.173
Okay. Thank you. And
where are we exactly?

56:50.174 --> 56:52.509
When our car broke down,
we kind of got lost.

56:52.510 --> 56:57.447
That's okay. That happens to a
lot of people out in these parts.

56:57.448 --> 56:58.815
Right.

56:58.816 --> 57:02.785
I always tell people they should
take comfort in the thought

57:02.786 --> 57:06.287
that they are always
watching over us.

57:07.557 --> 57:09.490
Hmm.

57:14.064 --> 57:17.565
- Did you hear that?
- Hear what?

57:18.201 --> 57:22.904
Listen, with your
mouth open, like this.

57:25.068 --> 57:26.673
Excuse me?

57:32.582 --> 57:36.084
Their horns are watching over us.

57:40.890 --> 57:44.826
- I'm sorry. Who's watching us?
- God's little angels.

57:47.497 --> 57:49.497
Who else?

58:19.228 --> 58:21.097
Thanks again for the ride.

58:21.098 --> 58:24.233
You have the rest
of the day nicely.

58:24.234 --> 58:27.335
Just push from the inside out.

58:30.406 --> 58:31.973
Bye.

58:36.412 --> 58:38.846
- Bye.
- Bye.

58:40.450 --> 58:42.852
- Inside out, don't forget.
- Okay, thanks.

58:47.924 --> 58:51.769
I'm gonna go use the phone,
okay? I'm gonna get us help.

58:51.770 --> 58:54.846
Stay here. Don't move.

58:56.499 --> 59:00.770
Haley! Haley, sit down. Sit down.

59:00.771 --> 59:04.974
I'm serious, okay?
I'm serious. Don't move.

59:04.975 --> 59:08.810
- I'm gonna get us out of here, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

Haley!

01:00:25.521 --> 01:00:27.088
Hey!

01:00:28.658 --> 01:00:30.325
Hey!

01:00:30.326 --> 01:00:32.126
Hey!

01:00:33.295 --> 01:00:35.164
Haley!

01:00:35.165 --> 01:00:39.333
- Stop the truck!
- Christ. What the hell are you doing?

01:00:40.203 --> 01:00:42.970
Get back! You get back now!

01:00:44.173 --> 01:00:46.609
Stop the truck! Stop it!

01:00:46.610 --> 01:00:48.943
- Get off my truck!
- Haley! Stop the truck!

01:00:49.278 --> 01:00:53.114
- Haley!
- Get off the goddamn truck!

01:01:29.819 --> 01:01:31.921
- Get away!
- Haley!

01:01:31.922 --> 01:01:34.022
- Stop!
- What is wrong with you?

01:01:51.741 --> 01:01:54.076
Boy, what's going on with your leg?

01:01:54.077 --> 01:01:56.044
Come on.

01:01:57.079 --> 01:01:59.148
You won't get far.

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.490
Nic.

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:44.493
Nic, what happened to your legs?

01:02:44.494 --> 01:02:48.129
Haley, I already explained to you.

01:02:48.931 --> 01:02:51.399
Are you feeling okay?

01:02:52.234 --> 01:02:54.101
Yeah.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.572
Yeah, I'm okay.

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:59.841
We're gonna be fine. Just...

01:03:00.542 --> 01:03:02.879
Just try to relax.

01:03:09.886 --> 01:03:11.819
Oh, shit.

01:03:31.740 --> 01:03:35.576
Is something wrong, Officer?
Is there some kind of trouble?

01:03:35.578 --> 01:03:39.914
No trouble at all, ma'am.
No trouble at all.

01:03:40.616 --> 01:03:42.450
Please.

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:47.355
Will you accompany me?

01:03:47.723 --> 01:03:49.457
Certainly.

01:04:09.445 --> 01:04:11.779
It doesn't make any sense.

01:04:14.283 --> 01:04:17.151
Where's the rest of the road?

01:04:19.588 --> 01:04:25.159
<i>Mirabelle, have you had contact
with any strangers lately?</i>

01:04:28.931 --> 01:04:31.999
Oh, yes.

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:36.138
We talked about... so
many wonderful things.

01:04:36.139 --> 01:04:39.175
But where did you
take them, Mirabelle?

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:41.377
What was your proximity to them?

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:45.681
It is so easy to find.

01:04:45.682 --> 01:04:50.586
<i>Always such a nice bit of color
against the dark nights.</i>

01:04:50.587 --> 01:04:52.421
<i>Dark nights, dark nights.</i>

01:04:52.422 --> 01:04:55.324
Dark nights, dark nights.

01:04:55.325 --> 01:04:58.893
Dark nights, nights...

01:05:02.197 --> 01:05:04.932
We could have a picnic.

01:05:04.967 --> 01:05:07.034
A picnic.

01:05:07.136 --> 01:05:10.206
<i>A picnic. Have a picnic.</i>

01:05:11.141 --> 01:05:12.475
<i>In a...</i>

01:05:12.476 --> 01:05:14.043
In a...

01:05:14.044 --> 01:05:15.378
<i>In a...</i>

01:05:15.379 --> 01:05:16.645
<i>On a...</i>

01:05:16.646 --> 01:05:17.912
<i>On a...</i>

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:25.186
<i>We're coming to get you.</i>

01:05:50.312 --> 01:05:52.748
Is that the same canyon?

01:05:52.749 --> 01:05:56.083
I don't know. I thought we
already passed it. Before.

01:05:56.318 --> 01:05:58.819
Maybe we circled back?

01:06:01.056 --> 01:06:03.557
Yeah, maybe. I don't know.

01:06:03.826 --> 01:06:06.293
It looks abandoned.

01:06:12.601 --> 01:06:14.770
What are you looking for?

01:06:14.771 --> 01:06:20.007
A gun, like, a cell phone or
a map or something in here.

01:06:23.679 --> 01:06:26.146
Do you wanna wear that?

01:06:41.697 --> 01:06:43.831
Come on, let's check it out.

01:06:53.209 --> 01:06:56.610
<i>The network is
currently unavailable.</i>

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:09.857
Haley, did you find anything?

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:13.594
Haley?

01:07:14.162 --> 01:07:15.629
Hey.

01:07:16.232 --> 01:07:21.602
Yeah, I found a map, but there's
not much information on it.

01:07:21.637 --> 01:07:23.938
"You are here."

01:07:25.541 --> 01:07:29.845
But we can't be. We
drove down, right?

01:07:29.846 --> 01:07:32.481
Isn't that the same gorge
we just came from?

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:35.517
Then that town, Good Springs,
should be down here, right?

01:07:35.518 --> 01:07:37.418
I guess.

01:07:38.857 --> 01:07:40.913
I don't get it.

01:08:19.895 --> 01:08:22.563
What do you think that sound is?

01:08:26.335 --> 01:08:28.969
I don't hear anything, Hay.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.305
What sound?

01:08:33.242 --> 01:08:35.009
There.

01:08:39.881 --> 01:08:43.484
I think we should
stay here tonight.

01:08:46.688 --> 01:08:48.822
Is this my fault?

01:08:49.158 --> 01:08:51.692
What? No.

01:08:52.027 --> 01:08:54.430
If anything, it's my fault.

01:08:54.430 --> 01:08:57.265
I was the one who
wanted to follow Nomad.

01:08:57.267 --> 01:08:59.734
I don't remember.

01:09:10.345 --> 01:09:12.513
Do they hurt?

01:09:14.550 --> 01:09:16.484
It's okay.

01:09:20.956 --> 01:09:23.323
So wide.

01:09:23.591 --> 01:09:26.359
I hope we can get across it.

01:09:42.544 --> 01:09:44.813
Haley. Hey, hey.

01:09:46.115 --> 01:09:48.381
We should go inside.

01:10:39.769 --> 01:10:41.437
Jonah!

01:10:41.438 --> 01:10:44.807
Jonah! Jonah!
No, Jonah! Jonah! It's me!

01:10:44.808 --> 01:10:49.144
Jonah, Jonah, Jonah!
Hey, it's Nic! Hey! It's Nic!

01:10:49.145 --> 01:10:52.980
Jonah, hey. Hey,
buddy, it's me. It's me.

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.615
Shit.

01:10:55.684 --> 01:10:58.887
Hello, James. Long time no see.

01:10:58.888 --> 01:11:00.589
"Hello, James."

01:11:02.125 --> 01:11:06.862
I'm trying to locate three individuals.
Two males, one female.

01:11:06.863 --> 01:11:09.465
All extremely contagious.

01:11:09.466 --> 01:11:12.399
Have you had any contact
with them, James?

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:18.607
What are you doing in my house?

01:11:18.608 --> 01:11:23.944
I'm glad to see you're comfortable
here, but is this your house?

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:26.647
Belongs to my mommy.

01:11:27.983 --> 01:11:30.686
- My brother sleeps right there.
- Yes?

01:11:30.687 --> 01:11:33.822
And I sleep right there,
and I have a little kitty.

01:11:33.823 --> 01:11:35.557
Your brother, your
mother and your kitty.

01:11:35.558 --> 01:11:37.559
Yeah.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:39.794
Can you remember
their names, James?

01:11:44.666 --> 01:11:48.637
Extraordinary, your will to survive

01:11:48.638 --> 01:11:53.173
fueled by your anger, your
fear, loneliness, frustration.

01:11:57.346 --> 01:12:00.748
- I admire you.
- I don't understand.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.252
It's all right, James.

01:13:10.485 --> 01:13:13.120
<i>I'm sorry I left you guys there.</i>

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:16.959
You know, I swear someone was helping me,
though I just can't bring it together.

01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:19.089
- Jonah, that place was...
- That place!

01:13:19.090 --> 01:13:22.186
This place! It's all the same, Nic.

01:13:22.798 --> 01:13:24.466
It's all the same.

01:13:24.467 --> 01:13:29.202
- What are you talking about?
- Look at your legs, man.

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:32.341
Look at your legs. Look at us.

01:13:32.342 --> 01:13:34.508
Look for the numbers.

01:13:34.776 --> 01:13:38.111
For... the tattoo.

01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:40.714
Do you have a tattoo?

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:49.089
This isn't an ID number?

01:13:49.491 --> 01:13:52.059
It is an ID number,

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:55.729
but it's just not for you.

01:13:56.398 --> 01:13:59.733
It's an ID for this
whole area, Nic.

01:14:00.803 --> 01:14:05.672
Two, plus three,
plus five, plus 41.

01:14:07.108 --> 01:14:08.942
51.

01:14:09.044 --> 01:14:11.413
Area 51, Nic. We're in Area 51.

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:13.348
- Jonah, I'm not sure...
- No, look at your legs!

01:14:13.349 --> 01:14:15.682
I'm looking at my legs!

01:14:15.851 --> 01:14:20.053
Watch. Empty.

01:14:22.057 --> 01:14:26.559
Everything is empty.
They're testing us, Nic.

01:14:26.562 --> 01:14:28.962
We're like little rats.

01:14:29.765 --> 01:14:32.668
Now, did you see the maps?

01:14:32.669 --> 01:14:34.536
What are you talking
about, the maps?

01:14:34.537 --> 01:14:38.307
What are you telling me, it's
not real? Of course it's real.

01:14:38.308 --> 01:14:42.242
There's roads, highways,
cities on these maps.

01:14:42.844 --> 01:14:45.345
They don't exist.

01:14:46.048 --> 01:14:49.418
We're trapped in a
huge government annex.

01:14:49.419 --> 01:14:52.031
Did you meet any of
the charming locals?

01:14:52.032 --> 01:14:56.123
Jonah. Jonah, listen to me.

01:15:01.229 --> 01:15:05.367
Listen to me. Haley is
really, really sick.

01:15:05.668 --> 01:15:08.971
Okay, we have to tell someone.
We have to tell someone.

01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:12.940
- We have to expose this.
- I'm sick, too.

01:15:15.043 --> 01:15:18.578
It's hard to explain, but
there's something in me.

01:15:20.048 --> 01:15:24.784
There's something that is... It's like
they took something from me, Nic.

01:15:25.587 --> 01:15:27.621
Took what?

01:15:28.957 --> 01:15:31.124
I feel like I'm...

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:34.627
I feel like I'm full of...

01:15:38.734 --> 01:15:41.234
- Gaps?
- Yes.

01:15:41.903 --> 01:15:43.972
That's exactly what it is.

01:15:43.973 --> 01:15:47.109
I mean, not exactly, but,
you know, it's really close.

01:15:47.110 --> 01:15:51.678
- So you know what I mean?
- Jonah, whose blood is that?

01:15:52.481 --> 01:15:54.714
Is that yours?

01:16:01.156 --> 01:16:03.991
I was trying to get them off.

01:16:06.161 --> 01:16:09.029
I was trying to get them off.

01:16:14.369 --> 01:16:16.271
Hey, buddy.

01:16:16.272 --> 01:16:20.175
We're gonna get somewhere where we can be
seen by as many people as possible, okay?

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:24.211
- It's the only way to be safe.
- They won't come off.

01:16:26.048 --> 01:16:29.082
But how would we do that?

01:16:29.885 --> 01:16:33.720
From what I've seen, there's
only one road in here.

01:16:35.123 --> 01:16:37.958
Well, that's the one we take.

01:17:17.399 --> 01:17:20.000
Okay, we're good. We're good.

01:17:40.555 --> 01:17:43.056
<i>Stop right there. Hold up.</i>

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:50.630
Hey, boss. We have
full clearance to pass.

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:54.834
<i>Check it out. Let's go.</i>

01:18:13.622 --> 01:18:18.425
<i>- Step out of your vehicle, sir.</i>
- No. That's okay.

01:18:18.627 --> 01:18:21.361
- It's time to go!
<i>- Block him down. Block him down.</i>

01:18:23.633 --> 01:18:25.732
Shit! Come on!

01:18:28.603 --> 01:18:30.370
Shit!

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:37.614
For God's sake, Nic! Stay
in the truck! Run, Nic!

01:18:39.615 --> 01:18:41.782
Jonah, what are you doing?

01:19:25.694 --> 01:19:28.228
It doesn't fucking type!

01:20:36.631 --> 01:20:39.933
Jonah!

01:20:41.569 --> 01:20:43.703
Jonah!

01:20:49.312 --> 01:20:51.978
Jonah, come on,
let's go! Get in the truck!

01:20:51.980 --> 01:20:53.882
Come on! Get back in!

01:20:53.883 --> 01:20:57.684
- Jonah, get in the truck!
- I'm done. I'm done.

01:21:01.323 --> 01:21:03.058
Just get in the truck.

01:21:03.059 --> 01:21:07.527
Nic, keep up.

01:21:09.564 --> 01:21:12.031
Get in the truck.

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:17.904
You put this shit on the
accelerator, go when I yell, "Go."

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:20.440
You go, Nic.

01:21:21.343 --> 01:21:23.976
Okay, Nic?

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.482
I need you to go.

01:21:30.752 --> 01:21:34.353
I need you to go. Please.

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:36.403
Put your seatbelt on.

01:24:44.145 --> 01:24:46.846
- Nic, I think we should just...
- Hold on.

01:25:00.896 --> 01:25:03.196
Nic, stop!

01:25:31.059 --> 01:25:33.292
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

01:25:47.709 --> 01:25:50.076
I love you.

01:26:30.585 --> 01:26:33.352
Haley!

01:27:40.621 --> 01:27:43.156
Don't even think about it, Nic.

01:27:43.691 --> 01:27:45.892
You can't reach her.

01:27:53.968 --> 01:27:56.035
<i>On my side.</i>

01:27:59.507 --> 01:28:02.375
Take a look at yourself, Nic.

01:28:03.344 --> 01:28:08.312
The perfect integration
of human will and...

01:28:09.250 --> 01:28:11.818
alien technology.

01:28:13.388 --> 01:28:15.988
Our finest achievement.

01:28:21.929 --> 01:28:23.930
Nomad?

01:28:26.434 --> 01:28:28.169
Nomad!

01:28:28.170 --> 01:28:32.674
Nomad, yes. I brought you here.

01:28:32.675 --> 01:28:37.245
But remember, Nic, you were the
one who came looking for me.

01:28:37.246 --> 01:28:40.014
So you might want to ask yourself,

01:28:40.015 --> 01:28:44.817
"Did I find what
I was looking for?"
