01:16.743 --> 01:18.643
He's in the other room.

01:26.586 --> 01:29.248
- Are you Thomas Gates?
- Yes.

01:30.290 --> 01:33.123
We got something
that we'd like you to take a look at.

01:33.460 --> 01:36.486
I hear you're quite good
with puzzles and riddles.

01:37.097 --> 01:41.363
- It's a coded message.
- It's a Playfair cipher.

01:42.602 --> 01:45.366
- Playfair cipher?
- Can you decode it?

01:45.438 --> 01:47.929
Cipher's impossible to decode
without the key.

01:48.007 --> 01:52.171
- What do you mean by "a key"?
- A keyword or phrase.

01:52.245 --> 01:55.612
I believe what you need is right there.

01:55.682 --> 01:57.673
It'll take some time.

01:59.719 --> 02:03.746
Go on. I'll take your diary.
I'll meet up with you later.

02:08.127 --> 02:10.858
Whoa.

02:26.212 --> 02:29.443
...calculate the distance
and you're sure to hit the mark

02:29.516 --> 02:31.780
in about most things
as well as shootin'.

02:34.220 --> 02:38.657
...ready to pour out all over you
like apple sass over roast pork.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.966
I'll take care not to
give up my hold on poor De Boots

02:47.133 --> 02:49.601
till I am quite sure of the American.

02:49.669 --> 02:54.436
Ah, that's my own girl.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.407
Augusta, dear, to your room.

03:00.013 --> 03:04.848
...to turn you inside out, old
gal, you sockdologizing old man-trap.

03:13.226 --> 03:16.525
<i>Sic semper tyrannis!</i>

03:33.012 --> 03:34.707
Temples.

03:36.382 --> 03:37.576
Gold.

03:37.750 --> 03:41.117
Cíbola? This is a treasure map.

03:42.922 --> 03:46.949
KGC? You're Knights of the
Golden Circle. You're a traitor.

03:47.026 --> 03:49.051
You're all traitors.

03:50.997 --> 03:54.831
- President Lincoln's been shot!
- Everybody, out! All of you!

03:54.901 --> 03:56.835
Killer's on the loose!

03:59.339 --> 04:03.332
I'd much appreciate it if you'd finish
deciphering that code now.

04:08.982 --> 04:11.280
- Dad!
- The war is over.

04:13.419 --> 04:14.647
No!

04:18.757 --> 04:21.522
- No!
- No!

04:26.866 --> 04:28.595
You're wrong about that.

04:30.003 --> 04:32.301
The war has only just begun!

04:37.577 --> 04:40.478
Charles.
The debt that all men... men pay.

04:40.546 --> 04:43.344
The debt that all men p...

04:45.184 --> 04:46.708
Dad! No, please!

04:52.392 --> 04:55.054
Come back. It's not fair.

04:56.129 --> 04:58.324
Help! Somebody help, please!

05:00.333 --> 05:01.823
So recapping:

05:01.901 --> 05:05.928
The Knights of the Golden Circle
was a Southern extremist group,

05:06.005 --> 05:09.133
operating in the north
to subvert Union forces.

05:09.208 --> 05:13.770
Had Thomas not burned the legendary
missing pages from the Booth diary,

05:13.846 --> 05:16.781
the killers may have found
a vast treasure of gold,

05:16.849 --> 05:19.784
and the Union may well have
lost the Civil War.

05:19.852 --> 05:22.218
Thank you.

05:24.657 --> 05:27.455
I'd like
to thank Ben and Patrick Gates.

05:27.527 --> 05:28.516
Thank you.

05:30.096 --> 05:34.863
And say what a wonderful addition Thomas
Gates is to our civilian heroes exhibit.

05:34.934 --> 05:35.923
Thank you.

05:37.603 --> 05:40.401
Thank you, Dr. Nichols.
I only wish my grandfather

05:40.473 --> 05:42.703
had been here to see this wonderful day.

05:42.775 --> 05:45.300
Excuse me.
I have a question I'd like to ask.

05:45.378 --> 05:48.176
What do you think happened
to that Booth diary page

05:48.247 --> 05:51.148
- that was pulled out of the fire?
- We may never know.

05:51.217 --> 05:52.650
Perhaps.

05:53.353 --> 05:56.379
Perhaps not.

05:56.456 --> 06:00.222
You see, I have one of those
great-great-granddaddies, like you,

06:00.326 --> 06:04.092
way up in my family tree,
name of Silas Wilkinson.

06:04.630 --> 06:08.088
He used to tell a story
about the night Lincoln was shot.

06:08.434 --> 06:10.129
As Silas tells it,

06:10.203 --> 06:14.435
Booth didn't seek out Thomas Gates
regarding the treasure map that night.

06:15.208 --> 06:17.301
It was Thomas who called the meeting.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.278
A meeting to plan
the assassination of Lincoln.

06:20.346 --> 06:22.837
- How absurd.
- That's a lie!

06:24.217 --> 06:27.084
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present to you...

06:28.287 --> 06:32.280
...one of the missing pages from the
infamous diary of John Wilkes Booth

06:32.358 --> 06:37.057
with the name Thomas Gates written on
a list along with all the other killers.

06:40.566 --> 06:43.660
- And Latin?
- Booth was a student of Latin.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.933
<i>He shouted, "Sic semper tyrannis"
after he shot Lincoln.</i>

06:47.006 --> 06:50.533
- "Thus always to... "
- "Thus always to tyrants. " We know.

06:51.244 --> 06:55.237
<i>- "Surratt, copiae"?
- Military supplies.</i>

06:55.314 --> 06:57.646
Mary Surratt was convicted and hanged

06:57.750 --> 07:00.617
for supplying Booth with
a rifle and field glasses.

07:04.457 --> 07:08.655
<i>- "Thomas Gates, artifex. "
- "Designer"</i>

07:08.728 --> 07:12.095
- or "mastermind. "
- I know what it means.

07:13.733 --> 07:16.429
He must have,
uh, planned the assassination.

07:16.502 --> 07:19.494
- I see.
- Could mean mastermind of anything.

07:20.606 --> 07:23.200
You see that?
Burned out right there.

07:23.943 --> 07:26.878
I can only imagine how difficult
this must be for you.

07:26.946 --> 07:29.744
- May I, Mr?
- Wilkinson.

07:29.816 --> 07:32.512
I'll see if this new page
matches the Booth diary.

07:32.585 --> 07:35.748
This is an outrage.
You're calling my grandfather a liar.

07:35.822 --> 07:39.383
With respect, now you're calling
my great-great-granddaddy a liar.

07:39.459 --> 07:42.656
Yes, sir, I am. This isn't
some garbage from a history book.

07:42.728 --> 07:45.094
My grandfather
told me this story himself.

07:45.164 --> 07:48.600
- I saw the truth of it in his eyes.
- I'm sorry, sir. I truly am.

08:01.013 --> 08:04.471
We'll test this thoroughly,
Patrick, to authenticate it.

08:05.084 --> 08:06.517
It can't be.

08:07.887 --> 08:09.718
Maps to presidents' houses.

08:10.890 --> 08:13.290
Keys to locks that don't exist.

08:13.993 --> 08:17.485
What's the point?
What am I looking for?

08:18.798 --> 08:21.028
Proof, proof, proof.

08:22.535 --> 08:23.866
What proof?

08:44.690 --> 08:48.148
Oh, wow. Is this a book
about the Templar treasure?

08:48.227 --> 08:52.755
Yes, it is about the Templar treasure,
but it's also about other things.

08:52.832 --> 08:57.326
Conspiracy theories, urban legends
and other myths that are true.

08:57.403 --> 09:00.861
- So the author's here signing copies?
- I'm the author.

09:01.674 --> 09:03.335
- You are?
- Yeah. See, uh...

09:03.409 --> 09:06.105
There's a picture of me right there.

09:07.914 --> 09:09.905
I think it's a pretty good picture.

09:09.982 --> 09:13.281
I thought that guy,
Benjamin Gates, found the treasure.

09:13.352 --> 09:17.220
Well, yes, Ben did,
but I am the co-finder.

09:17.290 --> 09:20.350
- Oh, I've never heard of you.
- Oh!

09:24.931 --> 09:28.128
Oh, my gosh. Are you Ben Gates?

09:29.936 --> 09:33.030
- Yes. Yes, I am.
- Do you own a red Ferrari?

09:35.708 --> 09:38.268
- Yes, I do.
- Well, it's being towed.

09:38.344 --> 09:39.538
Hm?

09:49.221 --> 09:51.917
Wait! Wait! That's my car!

09:58.864 --> 10:00.092
Where's the Ferrari?

10:01.434 --> 10:04.494
- IRS impounded it.
- The IRS?

10:04.570 --> 10:09.166
Funny story.
My accountant set up a corporation

10:09.241 --> 10:11.436
on an island that didn't exist

10:11.510 --> 10:14.536
and assured me
that that's how rich people do it.

10:14.614 --> 10:19.244
Then I got audited and slapped
with a huge fine plus interest.

10:20.686 --> 10:23.211
Wanna know what taxes
are on five million dollars?

10:23.289 --> 10:25.587
Six million dollars.

10:26.258 --> 10:28.453
But enough about me.

10:28.527 --> 10:30.893
What's new with you?

10:31.998 --> 10:35.832
Well, my girlfriend kicked me out,
I'm living with my dad,

10:35.901 --> 10:39.029
- my family killed President Lincoln.
- All right.

10:40.473 --> 10:41.940
I need your help.

10:42.174 --> 10:45.234
I can't believe
you have to break into your own house.

10:45.311 --> 10:49.008
I need to get Abigail's ID.
She has access to the Booth diary page.

10:49.081 --> 10:51.208
Why don't you ask Abigail for her help?

10:51.283 --> 10:54.684
She changed the alarm code, Riley.
She's not going to talk to me.

10:54.754 --> 10:55.812
All right.

10:55.888 --> 11:00.348
We have 30 seconds after
the alert starts to disable the alarm.

11:01.427 --> 11:03.827
Go.

11:06.666 --> 11:12.627
I'll probably regret asking this, but
what happened with you and Abigail?

11:12.705 --> 11:16.471
I don't know. I don't know.
She started using the word "so" a lot.

11:16.542 --> 11:17.941
"So?"

11:18.010 --> 11:21.070
Yeah, like,
"So, I guess my opinion doesn't matter. "

11:21.147 --> 11:25.049
"So, you seem to always know what's
best. " "So, I guess I'm invisible. "

11:25.117 --> 11:27.881
Now I've moved out,
we're dividing furniture...

11:27.953 --> 11:29.750
Oh.

11:29.822 --> 11:34.350
Women. Can't live with them, especially
if they change the alarm codes.

11:34.794 --> 11:36.455
You did that in 25 seconds.

11:37.029 --> 11:39.020
That's why I tell people to get a dog.

11:41.867 --> 11:43.596
- Got it.
- All right, let's go.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.701
That's not Abigail's car.

11:55.281 --> 11:56.748
She was on a date.

11:56.816 --> 12:00.308
Isn't that that guy?
The White House guy?

12:00.419 --> 12:04.116
The White House Easter Egg Roll
is next Monday. Maybe if you're not...

12:04.156 --> 12:05.145
He's weird!

12:05.224 --> 12:07.886
What happens if kids
don't find all the eggs?

12:07.960 --> 12:10.690
Wow. You work in a museum,
and you live in one.

12:10.763 --> 12:12.025
Pretty much.

12:12.098 --> 12:14.623
What clever repartee.
She must like him.

12:14.700 --> 12:17.726
All right, let me give you
a tour of the house.

12:17.803 --> 12:20.328
- OK.
- That's actually kind of...

12:20.406 --> 12:22.135
Oh, Abigail.

12:22.675 --> 12:25.940
- What are you doing here?
- I just needed to get some things.

12:26.011 --> 12:29.412
- Connor, good to see you again.
- Gates.

12:30.182 --> 12:31.706
How did you get in, Ben?

12:34.954 --> 12:37.320
Riley! Come out here!

12:39.792 --> 12:41.384
What?

12:43.295 --> 12:47.595
Hey! What are you doing here?
I mean, it's your house, but...

12:47.666 --> 12:50.692
I sent you a copy of my book.
Did you get a chance?

12:50.770 --> 12:53.796
- No, I haven't read it yet.
- Mm.

12:54.273 --> 12:56.867
I know you.
You're the White House curator.

12:56.942 --> 13:01.504
- I'm Riley. We met, uh, back in...
- Right. You're, uh, Ben's assistant.

13:01.814 --> 13:03.247
What?

13:03.315 --> 13:05.909
Um, maybe I should go.

13:05.985 --> 13:09.614
- Yeah, I'm really...
- Dinner tomorrow night?

13:10.289 --> 13:12.917
I... I actually already
have plans for tomorrow.

13:12.992 --> 13:14.254
You do?

13:15.461 --> 13:18.191
- Of course you do.
- But I'm free on Friday.

13:18.264 --> 13:21.358
- Awkward.
- Oh, great.

13:22.935 --> 13:24.562
- Good night.
- Good night.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.837
I cannot believe you broke in.

13:27.907 --> 13:30.501
- What did you take?
- It's just my things.

13:32.077 --> 13:33.271
Hand it over, Ben.

13:33.345 --> 13:35.905
I need to see
the Booth diary page.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.781
You saw the page yourself.
There is no treasure map on it.

13:39.852 --> 13:43.652
No, it's a cipher leading to a map.
Anyone spectral-image the page?

13:43.722 --> 13:47.021
No need to. The ink writing
on the page is clearly visible.

13:47.092 --> 13:49.287
It could have been erased or faded.

13:49.361 --> 13:52.819
You're the director of document
conservation. You know this.

13:52.898 --> 13:54.889
Not up to me.
It's not my department.

13:54.967 --> 13:57.492
That department reports
to your department.

13:57.603 --> 13:59.867
Come on. One look under infrared.

13:59.905 --> 14:01.896
You can have the Boston Tea Tables.

14:07.746 --> 14:09.043
Both of them?

14:12.318 --> 14:15.151
We've been looking
at this page for hours.

14:15.221 --> 14:16.813
There's nothing there.

14:17.656 --> 14:22.093
Ben, I really don't think we're
going to find anything on this page.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.595
In a hundred years,
no one's going to remember

14:24.663 --> 14:27.962
anyone involved in the Lincoln
assassination besides Booth.

14:28.033 --> 14:32.197
That's not true. Do you know
the expression, "His name is mud"?

14:32.304 --> 14:34.295
- Yes. Of course.
- You do?

14:34.373 --> 14:39.310
- You know the origin of the expression?
- Does anyone but you?

14:39.378 --> 14:43.041
Dr. Samuel Mudd was convicted
of being a co-conspirator

14:43.115 --> 14:46.778
in the Lincoln assassination.
The evidence was circumstantial.

14:46.852 --> 14:49.650
He was later pardoned,
but it didn't matter.

14:49.722 --> 14:54.489
Mudd's name still lives in infamy. And I
will not let Thomas Gates' name be mud.

14:56.896 --> 14:58.625
- Ben.
- What?

14:58.731 --> 15:00.096
Look at this.

15:01.333 --> 15:03.858
- See that?
- Oh.

15:03.936 --> 15:08.703
- That's quite something, isn't it?
- Yeah. It says "smudge. "

15:09.575 --> 15:10.906
It's nothing.

15:13.779 --> 15:16.646
Residual ink
from the facing page. Flip it.

15:17.316 --> 15:19.147
The letters are backwards.

15:19.218 --> 15:21.209
- It's a cipher.
- Yes. It is.

15:21.287 --> 15:23.585
A cipher.
See how the letters are coupled?

15:23.656 --> 15:29.424
Playfair ciphers encode letters
in pairs. This could prove his story.

15:29.495 --> 15:33.898
Unless you decode the cipher,
this does not prove a theory.

15:33.966 --> 15:36.196
That's OK.
We need a five-letter keyword.

15:36.268 --> 15:38.566
- What's the keyword?
- I don't know yet.

15:38.637 --> 15:41.401
- All right.
- Uh, can I get a printout of this?

15:41.473 --> 15:44.374
There's a billion words
in the English language.

15:44.443 --> 15:47.503
Got to be a logical...
Let's start from the beginning.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.137
A. Aardvark.

15:49.214 --> 15:53.207
Don't want to rain on your parade here,
but I don't think this is gonna stop

15:53.285 --> 15:57.244
Dr. Nichols from announcing
the discovery of the page tomorrow.

15:57.323 --> 16:02.124
No, now, wait. Can't you ask him to
wait until I prove Thomas is innocent?

16:03.495 --> 16:05.156
What if he isn't innocent?

16:15.874 --> 16:19.503
Sir? Looks like our old friend
Ben Gates is in the news again.

16:19.578 --> 16:21.705
What did he find now? Atlantis?

16:21.780 --> 16:24.476
A guy came forward
with a missing Booth diary page.

16:24.550 --> 16:26.609
That's not the best part.
Listen to this.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.778
"On the page are the names
of the conspirators

16:28.854 --> 16:32.881
in the Lincoln assassination, as well
as a previously unknown conspirator,

16:32.958 --> 16:36.587
Thomas Gates. Thomas Gates is said
to be the great-great-grandfather

16:36.662 --> 16:39.256
of treasure hunter
Benjamin Franklin Gates. "

16:39.331 --> 16:43.233
- Thought my relatives were bad.
- What do we know about this Wilkinson?

16:43.302 --> 16:47.500
- Sir?
- Guy claims he had this page

16:47.573 --> 16:50.906
for 140 years then just suddenly
comes forward with it?

16:52.878 --> 16:55.244
- Why?
- We'll find out.

16:55.314 --> 16:56.610
Better.

16:57.483 --> 16:58.780
Bacon.

17:01.954 --> 17:03.649
- Keep going.
- That's stupid.

17:08.894 --> 17:11.920
- How's he doing?
- Keep working.

17:13.732 --> 17:16.530
<i>We're grateful
to the Wilkinson family</i>

17:16.602 --> 17:18.297
<i>for coming forth with the page.</i>

17:18.369 --> 17:23.239
<i>On the page is a name of a previously
unknown conspirator, Thomas Gates.</i>

17:23.308 --> 17:26.835
- Nichols has bought into it. See?
- Would you stop watching that.

17:29.014 --> 17:30.345
It's on the Internet!

17:31.183 --> 17:34.619
<i>- No stopping it now.
- Gates may have been the architect...</i>

17:35.554 --> 17:38.284
- They have no understanding.
- You know the truth.

17:38.357 --> 17:41.656
That's all that matters.
You heard the story from Grandpa.

17:41.727 --> 17:46.096
The story? This guy's got evidence.
He's got everything.

17:46.165 --> 17:47.996
We have a story. We have nothing.

17:48.067 --> 17:51.594
For one brief moment,
the Gates family could hold its head up.

17:51.670 --> 17:54.730
- Now we're a bunch of crazies.
- But we're not liars.

17:55.941 --> 17:58.034
Wilkinson is saying that Thomas Gates

17:58.143 --> 18:02.705
was a mastermind to one of
the darkest hours in U.S. History.

18:02.748 --> 18:05.342
And he burned the diary page
to cover that up.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.518
You and I both know he burned the page

18:08.587 --> 18:11.078
to keep Booth's men
from finding the treasure.

18:11.156 --> 18:12.953
That's what we're going to prove.

18:13.025 --> 18:15.516
- Only one way to prove it.
- Find the treasure.

18:15.594 --> 18:18.961
You've got to find it. You're
going to help me find it. So come on.

18:19.031 --> 18:21.727
Let's hear the story again
from Grandpa Charles.

18:21.800 --> 18:26.362
Grandpa heard his father say,
"Treasure map. "

18:26.438 --> 18:30.499
- Then there was a commotion.
- Got all that. Anything after that?

18:30.576 --> 18:34.137
Anything he said,
something he did? Anything at all?

18:35.013 --> 18:37.038
- Wait a minute.
- What?

18:40.152 --> 18:42.313
He took his son's hand.

18:42.387 --> 18:46.483
He looked him in the eye, and he said,
with his dying breath,

18:46.558 --> 18:51.427
- "The debt that all men pay. "
- "The debt that all men pay"?

18:51.497 --> 18:53.624
The debt that Thomas paid.

18:54.166 --> 18:56.031
That's five letters.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.625
Oh!

18:57.736 --> 18:58.862
Try "Death. "

18:58.904 --> 19:00.667
- What?
- It's the keycode.

19:00.739 --> 19:02.570
The debt that all men pay is death.

19:07.312 --> 19:08.370
All right.

19:10.415 --> 19:13.282
L- A-B-O-U-L...

19:13.452 --> 19:15.920
It's Lab-ool...

19:15.988 --> 19:20.186
Lab-ahl... La...

19:20.259 --> 19:21.419
It's gibberish.

19:21.493 --> 19:23.723
- Laboulaye!
- Laboulaye!

19:23.795 --> 19:26.423
- What is that?
- It's a who. Èdouard Laboulaye.

19:26.498 --> 19:27.522
Where's the phone?

19:27.599 --> 19:30.295
I don't know.
Can't find anything in this mess.

19:30.369 --> 19:34.362
- Temporary till I find a new place.
- Find the old one. I like her.

19:36.875 --> 19:38.638
- Hi.
- Dr. Chase.

19:38.710 --> 19:40.871
- Abigail, please.
- Abigail.

19:40.946 --> 19:43.244
- Nice to meet you.
- Have a seat.

19:46.718 --> 19:48.879
Thanks for agreeing to meet with me.

19:48.954 --> 19:52.754
Of course. I was actually going
to call you about the diary page.

19:52.824 --> 19:55.054
- Any news?
- Well...

19:55.127 --> 19:59.461
We actually found some
latent letter fragments on it.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.091
Take a look.

20:04.303 --> 20:06.669
Random letters. A cipher?

20:06.738 --> 20:08.365
- Maybe.
- Gates seen this?

20:08.440 --> 20:10.499
He's the one that discovered it.

20:11.643 --> 20:14.111
- I'm sorry.
- Not a problem.

20:16.582 --> 20:19.210
- I need one minute.
- Please, take your time.

20:19.284 --> 20:20.478
Hey. What?

20:20.552 --> 20:23.020
We cracked the cipher. It's "Laboulaye. "

20:23.088 --> 20:24.817
<i>The cipher spells "Laboulaye. "</i>

20:24.890 --> 20:28.917
So? Laboulaye was well-known
in France. It could be nothing.

20:28.994 --> 20:32.691
Or maybe there was a treasure map
like Thomas Gates said there was,

20:32.764 --> 20:35.995
and Laboulaye had it.
We only got a partial on the next word.

20:36.068 --> 20:38.229
L- A-D, lad... ladder...

20:38.303 --> 20:39.964
- L-A-D.
- Aladdin! Aladdin?

20:40.038 --> 20:42.438
- Lady!
- Thank you, Abigail!

20:43.175 --> 20:46.542
Laboulaye Lady. Do you know
what Laboulaye was planning

20:46.612 --> 20:49.240
<i>right around the time
Lincoln was assassinated?</i>

20:49.314 --> 20:51.441
OK, Ben, I've got to go.

20:51.516 --> 20:53.984
There's a map or a clue to a map
on the Statue...

20:54.820 --> 20:57.482
- She hung up.
- She took your call. That was good.

20:57.589 --> 21:00.251
- Dr. Gates?
- Yes.

21:01.093 --> 21:05.496
Sounds like he cracked the cipher.
I couldn't help but overhear.

21:05.564 --> 21:08.624
Laboulaye? As in Èdouard Laboulaye?

21:08.700 --> 21:11.294
He seems to believe so, yes.

21:11.370 --> 21:13.770
Man who had the idea
for the Statue of Liberty.

21:13.839 --> 21:17.070
You're saying there's a treasure map
in the Statue of Liberty?

21:17.142 --> 21:21.044
Laboulaye was a Mason.
They built clues into everything.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.978
Did you learn that from my book?

21:26.018 --> 21:28.646
- Have an interest in history?
- Fascinated by it.

21:29.254 --> 21:32.189
Civil War, especially.
My family's descended from

21:32.257 --> 21:35.556
Confederate General Albert Pike.
He was a remarkable man.

21:35.627 --> 21:39.825
But, then again, what is history but
a marker for the deeds of great men?

21:39.898 --> 21:45.063
A man only has one lifetime,
but history can remember you forever.

21:45.137 --> 21:48.300
So the only question is,
which Statue of Liberty?

21:48.373 --> 21:49.465
Exactly.

21:50.509 --> 21:51.840
Is there more than one?

21:52.978 --> 21:55.469
There are three, actually, Riley.

21:55.547 --> 21:59.984
One is in New York,
one in the Luxembourg Garden.

22:00.085 --> 22:02.884
But he only referred to one
as his "lady. "

22:19.671 --> 22:22.435
This is like, impossible,
what you're doing.

22:22.507 --> 22:24.134
I'm glad you're enjoying it.

22:24.209 --> 22:28.236
Laboulaye had to leave a clue
somewhere on here. Move in on the torch.

22:28.313 --> 22:31.146
Let me get there.
It's not as easy as it looks.

22:31.216 --> 22:33.616
No. Believe me, I understand.

22:37.322 --> 22:39.381
Excuse me, officer. May I help you?

22:39.858 --> 22:42.725
Ah, American, eh?

22:42.861 --> 22:44.351
Of course you see no problem

22:44.429 --> 22:47.660
in disturbing everyone's
pleasant morning

22:47.733 --> 22:50.099
- with your buzzing there.
- Hey!

22:50.168 --> 22:54.468
You know how much our constitution was
influenced by your man, Montesquieu?

22:54.539 --> 22:56.268
- You know Montesquieu?
- Got it.

22:58.643 --> 23:01.874
Montesquieu, yeah. "A government
should be set up so that... "

23:01.913 --> 23:05.041
"... no man need
be afraid of another. "

23:05.617 --> 23:07.346
- That's very good.
- Thank you.

23:08.687 --> 23:11.178
- I'm astonished.
- I got it, I got it.

23:11.523 --> 23:14.321
- I hope you read French.
- May I?

23:16.194 --> 23:17.627
He's a cop.

23:17.696 --> 23:23.464
Um... "Across the sea
these twins stand determined... "

23:23.535 --> 23:26.003
- Resolute.
- "Resolute," yeah.

23:26.071 --> 23:28.972
"... to preserve what we are looking for.

23:29.040 --> 23:32.942
- Uh... Laboulaye, 1876."
- Six.

23:33.011 --> 23:36.538
- It's a clue.
- "These twins stand resolute. "

23:36.882 --> 23:39.544
Let's see. Resolute twins.

23:41.153 --> 23:42.552
Resolute.

23:43.321 --> 23:46.154
Resolute. And then twins.

23:46.925 --> 23:51.862
Siamese twins? Siam? Trade routes
between France and Thailand?

23:52.564 --> 23:55.499
<i>That's ridiculous.
HMS Resolute.</i>

23:56.435 --> 24:00.895
A British ship that got lost
in the Arctic in the 1800s.

24:01.006 --> 24:05.943
It was salvaged by American whalers, and
then Congress sent it back to England.

24:05.977 --> 24:08.468
When the ship was finally retired,

24:08.547 --> 24:13.507
Queen Victoria had two desks
made from its timbers.

24:13.585 --> 24:15.985
Voilà. Resolute twins.

24:16.054 --> 24:20.388
- And where are those desks now?
- The closest one is in London.

24:20.459 --> 24:22.757
How fast can we get
to Buckingham Palace?

24:22.828 --> 24:25.388
Don't know. Why don't you ask
your new best friend?

24:27.966 --> 24:29.490
He's going to call you a cab.

24:29.568 --> 24:31.092
OK?

24:31.169 --> 24:34.832
- Nice helicopter. Is that yours?
- Yes, actually. It is.

24:34.906 --> 24:39.002
- OK, so you get the ticket.
- Great.

24:39.444 --> 24:43.073
Mitch Wilkinson studied history
at Virginia Military Institute.

24:43.148 --> 24:47.016
Graduated 1978. Ran a private security
company which had contracts in Iraq

24:47.085 --> 24:49.883
during the invasion,
and in the Congo in the late '90s.

24:49.955 --> 24:54.221
These are trained mercenaries as well as
being black-market antiquities dealers.

24:55.093 --> 24:57.823
So why does a black market
antiquities dealer...

24:58.497 --> 25:02.160
...give up a rare Civil War artifact?

25:02.234 --> 25:06.466
Something he could sell to a private
collector for a good deal of money?

26:09.901 --> 26:11.869
So the queen's office is here.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.030
The elevator shaft gets you close,

26:14.105 --> 26:17.939
but the only direct access
is through security.

26:18.009 --> 26:21.467
- That should be exciting.
- We got to get you in that room.

26:23.114 --> 26:24.547
<i>- Hi, Dad.
- Ben.</i>

26:24.616 --> 26:27.176
It's Patrick Gates' phone.
He's calling Ben.

26:27.252 --> 26:28.310
Give me that.

26:29.187 --> 26:32.054
The house was broken into
last night. I was attacked.

26:32.123 --> 26:33.647
Call the police. I'm coming home.

26:33.725 --> 26:35.556
- What?
- What good would that do?

26:35.627 --> 26:38.721
<i>They didn't take anything.
And besides, I'm fine.</i>

26:38.797 --> 26:42.255
OK. We're in London.
We're going to Buckingham Palace.

26:42.334 --> 26:45.497
<i>We have an appointment
with the curator tomorrow afternoon.</i>

26:45.570 --> 26:47.800
<i>- Son, just be careful. Goodbye.
- Bye.</i>

26:47.872 --> 26:49.737
Someone else is after the treasure.

26:49.808 --> 26:52.208
Of course someone else
is after the treasure.

26:52.277 --> 26:56.145
- It's the axiom of treasure hunting.
- We have to hurry and see that desk.

26:56.214 --> 26:58.409
We don't want to miss that appointment.

27:00.585 --> 27:03.679
- Hi. Ben Gates.
- See security. They'll let you in.

27:19.838 --> 27:20.827
Wow.

27:43.995 --> 27:46.657
OK. It's teatime, chaps.

28:00.612 --> 28:03.740
Looking for the curator's office.
Which way was it again?

28:03.815 --> 28:06.283
Follow the stairs round,
then turn first left.

28:06.351 --> 28:07.978
Thank you so much.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.155
- Ben.
- Abigail.

28:15.226 --> 28:17.456
- What's she doing here?
- What're you doing?

28:17.529 --> 28:20.623
Your dad called me.
Said your next clue was here.

28:20.699 --> 28:22.633
<i>- She's really there?
- Ben...</i>

28:22.634 --> 28:24.234
<i>- Drop her. Lose her.
- I want to help.</i>

28:24.235 --> 28:26.999
That's very nice,
but it's a bad time right now.

28:27.072 --> 28:30.769
- A bad time, right now?
- It's a bad time.

28:30.842 --> 28:35.472
OK, I just flew all the way
to London to offer my help...

28:35.547 --> 28:37.947
<i>- Remember the plan.
- You don't need it?</i>

28:38.049 --> 28:39.778
You're the one making a scene.

28:39.851 --> 28:43.287
- I... I'm not making a scene right now.
- We want to make a scene.

28:43.354 --> 28:46.983
Well then, fine! If that's what
you want, let's have it out now!

28:47.492 --> 28:51.258
<i>- So subtle.
- Let me guess? It's the wrong time.</i>

28:51.329 --> 28:54.196
It's the wrong place. I'm wrong again!

28:54.265 --> 28:57.200
Wrong about us,
wrong about Thomas Gates,

28:57.268 --> 28:59.862
wrong that you'd like
the Queen Anne chair!

28:59.971 --> 29:01.962
You're wrong to assume
I'd like the chair.

29:02.006 --> 29:05.908
You see? Everybody, listen to this.
This is more interesting than that.

29:05.977 --> 29:09.469
She thinks that even when I'm right,
I'm wrong! Isn't that right?

29:09.547 --> 29:13.415
Abigail, just because
I answer a question quickly

29:13.485 --> 29:14.850
doesn't make it wrong.

29:14.919 --> 29:18.616
Not if the answer's something
we need to figure out as a couple.

29:18.690 --> 29:20.385
- That's what couples do!
- Sir.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.449
You and your missis, take it outside.

29:22.527 --> 29:26.588
Now look what you've done. You've
brought the little bobbies down on us!

29:26.664 --> 29:29.633
You take the missis outside.
I'm staying right here.

29:30.335 --> 29:32.235
- Ben!
- Whee!

29:32.303 --> 29:34.032
- Good afternoon, sir.
- Hello.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.573
- Been drinking, have we?
- Just a nip.

29:36.641 --> 29:39.667
Popped down to the pub for a pint!
Bit of all right!

29:39.744 --> 29:41.712
Going to arrest a man for that?

29:41.780 --> 29:45.216
Going to detain a blighter
for enjoying his whiskey?

29:45.283 --> 29:46.875
- Enough.
- Bangers and mash.

29:46.951 --> 29:48.578
Bubbles and squeak. Smoked eel pie.

29:48.653 --> 29:49.677
- Sir!
- Haggis!

29:49.754 --> 29:53.622
- That's it! Dismount the banister!
- I've got a lovely bunch of coconuts!

29:53.691 --> 29:55.784
Here they are, standing in a row!

29:55.860 --> 29:58.920
Small ones, big ones,
some as big as your head!

29:58.997 --> 30:01.488
That was brilliant.

30:02.100 --> 30:05.934
- What's wrong with being right?
- Nothing. You should try it sometime.

30:06.004 --> 30:09.064
- You're saying that I'm never right?
- I did not say that.

30:09.140 --> 30:11.267
Hoo! So I'm wrong again.

30:11.576 --> 30:14.443
- Now, see, there you are correct.
- Capital. Topper.

30:14.512 --> 30:18.744
Your mother told me about you.

30:19.717 --> 30:24.279
- In here, please.
- Why don't you just make a list

30:24.355 --> 30:27.518
of what's OK for me
to say or not write something...

30:28.193 --> 30:30.491
- What's right or wrong...
- You two, stay.

30:30.562 --> 30:32.530
- Right?
- No! No, no, man.

30:32.597 --> 30:35.862
- Don't leave me in here!
- That's great. Wow.

30:36.467 --> 30:37.900
What is going on?

30:37.969 --> 30:41.905
I'm sorry for getting you roped
into this, but you were excellent.

30:42.507 --> 30:45.067
- Thank you. So were you.
- When did you figure out

30:45.143 --> 30:47.873
- it was a fake argument?
- When'd you figure out I was

30:47.946 --> 30:50.608
- arguing during the fake argument?
- The middle.

30:50.682 --> 30:53.617
Where "I assume I'm right. "
Get us out. Which I don't get.

30:53.685 --> 30:56.620
If I'm right, after I assume I'm right,
then I'm correct.

30:56.688 --> 30:59.122
When you get to a conclusion
without asking,

30:59.224 --> 31:02.216
and you happen to be right,
you got lucky.

31:03.795 --> 31:05.319
I get lucky a lot.

31:05.797 --> 31:07.924
So where does that leave me, Ben?

31:07.999 --> 31:10.229
You guys are so great together.

31:10.301 --> 31:12.201
- Want to know why I'm here?
- Uh-huh.

31:14.239 --> 31:17.640
Think there may be a clue on
the Resolute desk in the queen's study.

31:19.477 --> 31:20.876
Does that help?

31:20.945 --> 31:25.405
Don't understand why it's difficult for
you to include others in your decisions.

31:25.483 --> 31:29.010
Just because you may know
what my answer is going to be

31:29.087 --> 31:31.647
doesn't mean you don't have to ask me.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.124
<i>Door number one, opening.</i>

31:37.195 --> 31:39.288
OK. Let me try this out.

31:40.331 --> 31:43.459
Abigail, would you like
to come with me, please?

31:43.534 --> 31:45.297
Yes. Thank you.

31:45.370 --> 31:46.997
Ridiculous. You're staying.

31:47.071 --> 31:49.005
- It's too dangerous.
- I am so coming.

31:49.073 --> 31:51.633
- Door number two.
- Door two, coming up.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.642
- You're not coming.
- Call security.

31:55.246 --> 31:58.238
<i>You should be near
a service elevator.</i>

31:58.349 --> 32:00.544
What are you doing?
Are those for the queen?

32:00.585 --> 32:04.612
Queen's not here. There's
no flag flying. Queen's at Windsor.

32:04.689 --> 32:07.214
- What are you doing?
- See the desk, without you.

32:08.493 --> 32:09.892
- No.
- Don't let her go.

32:09.961 --> 32:11.394
Abigail...

32:12.497 --> 32:14.488
All right. Get in. Get in. Get in!

32:16.167 --> 32:17.429
Hold this.

32:23.608 --> 32:25.906
Will you give me
the flowers back, please?

32:25.977 --> 32:27.035
Yeah.

32:33.117 --> 32:36.814
- What?
- Wearing the perfume I bought you.

32:37.689 --> 32:38.678
So?

32:39.324 --> 32:41.519
So I think it smells kind of pretty.

32:42.360 --> 32:45.523
- It's the flowers, Ben.
- No, it's not.

32:48.800 --> 32:50.267
Let's go.

32:55.239 --> 32:56.900
<i>OK, now turn left.</i>

32:57.775 --> 33:00.505
<i>- Dead end.
- I mean right. Go right.</i>

33:06.551 --> 33:09.918
- The flowers... petals... stamens.
- Good. Good.

33:17.929 --> 33:19.260
Go, go.

33:22.266 --> 33:23.631
That's it.

33:25.603 --> 33:27.230
The Resolute desk.

33:28.339 --> 33:29.704
We're looking for...

33:30.808 --> 33:35.609
...writing, patterns in the carvings.
Could be anything.

33:39.117 --> 33:40.482
Hey, look at this.

33:43.488 --> 33:48.687
- "Malcolm Gilvary, 1880."
- Hold on one second.

33:49.460 --> 33:53.920
Here we go. Malcolm Gilvary.
He didn't make furniture.

33:53.998 --> 33:57.092
<i>He made Chinese puzzle boxes.</i>

34:05.009 --> 34:06.533
- Oh...
- What?

34:07.645 --> 34:12.206
I think these drawers
work like tumblers in a safe.

34:12.283 --> 34:15.810
OK, four drawers...
Four-digit combination?

34:16.754 --> 34:17.846
What about a year?

34:17.922 --> 34:22.655
Uh, let me see.
Queen Victoria, born 1819.

34:22.726 --> 34:24.558
So you go one...

34:27.498 --> 34:28.487
Eight.

34:33.538 --> 34:34.562
One.

34:38.708 --> 34:39.766
Nine.

34:41.612 --> 34:45.309
- Any luck?
- OK... 1876 was on the inscription

34:45.382 --> 34:47.715
<i>on the statue in Paris. Let's try
that.</i>

34:48.252 --> 34:49.241
One.

34:51.589 --> 34:52.817
Eight.

34:55.393 --> 34:57.121
Seven.

35:01.899 --> 35:03.230
Six.

35:29.961 --> 35:30.950
Uh-oh.

35:31.562 --> 35:32.756
New rules.

35:33.631 --> 35:36.896
These markings, like Incan or Aztec.

35:36.968 --> 35:39.198
I have never seen any symbols like this.

35:39.270 --> 35:44.640
I mean, this looks centuries older
than Civil War.

35:44.709 --> 35:46.108
What do you think it means?

35:46.177 --> 35:49.704
I doubt it has anything to do
with the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

35:52.350 --> 35:53.510
Uh-oh.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.882
<i>Mayday. Mayday. Ben, get out of
there.</i>

36:01.526 --> 36:05.758
- Oi! Where are my detainees?
- OK, let's make some noise.

36:10.368 --> 36:11.767
The fire alarm's gone off.

36:11.836 --> 36:13.895
Uh-oh. God save the queen.

36:14.939 --> 36:16.873
<i>All units, go to action zebra.</i>

36:16.941 --> 36:19.034
- What's going on?
- Haven't the foggiest.

36:21.612 --> 36:25.207
Someone or something is causing this.

36:25.283 --> 36:28.548
- Check your primary stations.
- This doesn't make any sense.

36:28.619 --> 36:31.884
Find the source terminal
and check public areas four and eight.

36:47.738 --> 36:51.868
This way, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you very much. Keep moving.

36:51.943 --> 36:55.572
Keep walking until you're
on the other side of the fountain.

36:55.646 --> 37:00.982
- Excuse me, excuse me. Coming through.
- I got them. They're at the main gate.

37:18.803 --> 37:21.966
- Oi! Sparkle. Come on.
- OK. Here we go.

37:22.039 --> 37:23.597
I'm a little bit allergic.

37:23.674 --> 37:25.835
- Riley.
- Thank you. OK.

37:25.910 --> 37:29.243
- See you later. Thank you. Bye-bye.
- Sit! Sorry!

37:30.248 --> 37:32.876
Thanks for waiting for me.
Can I see the thing?

37:34.385 --> 37:35.784
Daniel, hold it.

37:38.289 --> 37:39.620
What is that?

37:39.690 --> 37:42.386
Went to Buckingham Palace,
all I got was this wood?

37:42.460 --> 37:45.122
Look at the symbols.
Never seen anything like this.

37:45.696 --> 37:47.425
It's an incredible discovery.

37:48.599 --> 37:52.501
- Wilkinson.
- Stop them. Go, go, go!

37:54.438 --> 37:57.066
- He's the one after the treasure.
- I'll drive.

38:00.745 --> 38:01.837
We're in England.

38:08.886 --> 38:10.217
It's a gun! Get down!

38:13.090 --> 38:16.787
- We're trapped!
- Hang on! Keep your heads down.

38:28.239 --> 38:29.331
Hey, who are you?

38:45.356 --> 38:46.448
Sorry.

38:49.460 --> 38:51.690
- Hey!
- Oi!

38:57.935 --> 39:01.166
- Ben, they're getting closer.
- What is their problem?

39:04.008 --> 39:05.441
Whoa!

39:06.977 --> 39:09.070
- Go left! Go left!
- Hold on.

39:16.153 --> 39:17.450
Turn, turn!

39:18.456 --> 39:19.445
Watch out!

39:26.063 --> 39:27.189
Everybody OK?

39:32.470 --> 39:35.530
- Come on, come on.
- Danny, I want them stopped.

39:40.144 --> 39:41.270
Look out!

39:42.046 --> 39:43.035
Ah!

39:51.622 --> 39:52.782
Ah!

40:14.979 --> 40:16.310
Go. Go, go, go, go!

40:18.983 --> 40:20.473
Did you see where he went?

40:24.989 --> 40:28.220
- What is that? Someone's phone.
- It's him.

40:28.292 --> 40:31.523
- Have his number in your speed dial?
- Oh, shu...

40:31.595 --> 40:33.790
This has to end
before someone gets hurt.

40:33.864 --> 40:36.890
Give me what you got at Buckingham,
it won't be necessary.

40:36.967 --> 40:38.264
Tell that to my father.

40:41.038 --> 40:44.064
Moron!

40:44.141 --> 40:46.632
Why are they standing
in the middle of the street?

40:48.946 --> 40:51.881
- Where are these people going?
- Why's everyone running?

40:55.653 --> 40:57.621
- He's right there! Go!
- Move!

41:00.157 --> 41:02.091
Get out of the way!

41:04.061 --> 41:07.462
- Did I just run over a man's foot?
- Watch the people!

41:16.106 --> 41:17.733
Go! Go! Faster!

41:30.354 --> 41:32.219
- Right over there.
- I got them.

41:33.557 --> 41:36.355
- They're still behind us.
- This phone have a camera?

41:36.427 --> 41:39.919
- No. No, it's broken.
- All right. Give me the plank.

41:44.101 --> 41:46.126
Hang on.
We're going to run a red light.

41:46.203 --> 41:48.364
Ah! Ah!

41:56.847 --> 42:00.806
Hack into the London Police database
and get a picture from that traffic cam.

42:00.918 --> 42:03.546
- Okey-dokey.
- You can't do it?

42:03.587 --> 42:06.454
No, I can. I just don't like
that you assume that I can.

42:06.524 --> 42:09.084
Why, thank you, Riley.

42:32.182 --> 42:33.308
Get it!

42:36.487 --> 42:37.681
Stop! Stop!

42:58.709 --> 43:00.574
- He's got it.
- What is it?

43:00.644 --> 43:03.045
I don't know, but it's ours. Let's go.

43:11.622 --> 43:14.284
- Abigail!
- Hey, Patrick.

43:15.459 --> 43:17.450
Nice to see you two together again.

43:17.528 --> 43:19.723
- Yeah, well, we're not.
- Yeah.

43:19.797 --> 43:23.255
Oh, I was hoping to get some
of these boxes out of the house.

43:32.376 --> 43:36.437
I can't read the whole thing,
but I can tell you that

43:36.513 --> 43:40.005
these are definitely pre-colonial
Native American markings.

43:40.084 --> 43:43.485
- Easily 500 years old.
- Easily.

43:47.424 --> 43:50.257
I can identify one symbol.

43:50.794 --> 43:53.388
Look at this.
Do you know what that is?

43:53.464 --> 43:55.432
Sacred calendrical? I don't know.

43:55.899 --> 43:58.459
That symbol is Cíbola.

43:59.269 --> 44:00.395
That's Cíbola.

44:01.905 --> 44:03.805
The City of Gold.

44:04.408 --> 44:05.670
The City of Gold.

44:08.646 --> 44:12.673
"In 1527, a Spanish ship
wrecked on the Florida coast.

44:12.750 --> 44:14.615
There were only four survivors.

44:14.685 --> 44:19.679
One was a slave named Estebán
who saved a local tribe's dying chief.

44:19.757 --> 44:22.590
As a reward,
he was taken to their sacred city,

44:22.660 --> 44:24.560
a city built from solid gold.

44:26.530 --> 44:30.591
Later, when Estebán tried to find
the city again, he never could.

44:30.668 --> 44:36.300
But the legend grew, and every explorer
came to the New World in search of it.

44:37.241 --> 44:41.200
When General Custer's search for gold
ended with his last stand

44:41.278 --> 44:45.715
at Little Bighorn, it became clear
none would ever find it. "

44:51.355 --> 44:56.088
Ben, can you imagine if the Confederates
got their hands on the City of Gold...

44:56.827 --> 44:58.294
My God.

44:59.229 --> 45:00.821
I'm going to go talk to her.

45:04.702 --> 45:07.102
- You're coming with me.
- No!

45:07.171 --> 45:11.437
- Hey. No one else can translate it.
- There are others.

45:11.508 --> 45:12.873
There are several others.

45:12.943 --> 45:15.275
For ancient Native American?
No one better.

45:15.345 --> 45:18.337
- Who?
- Look, Ben, I can't go with you.

45:18.415 --> 45:21.612
- It's been, what? Twenty-five years.
- Thirty-two.

45:23.287 --> 45:24.515
That long?

45:25.255 --> 45:28.952
There's a reason
why we haven't spoken in 32 years.

45:29.026 --> 45:31.722
- We have nothing in common.
- Me?

45:32.396 --> 45:36.230
Yes, of course. And I'm sure
she's just as proud of you as I am.

45:36.300 --> 45:38.700
- Who?
- His mom.

45:41.672 --> 45:45.802
- Will you relax? It's gonna be fine.
- Sure. Should look at the bright side.

45:45.876 --> 45:49.642
Been a long time. Maybe she
lost her memory, won't recognize me.

45:50.481 --> 45:51.880
I hate her!

45:53.884 --> 45:55.408
We're in the right place.

45:58.555 --> 46:01.718
I'm gonna take myself
out of the line of fire for this one.

46:01.792 --> 46:03.623
- Hi, Mom.
- Benjamin!

46:03.694 --> 46:06.857
Abigail! What a surprise!
Hello, sweetheart.

46:06.930 --> 46:07.919
Hi.

46:09.166 --> 46:10.155
Oh.

46:11.869 --> 46:15.361
You see? One syllable,
a knife in the heart.

46:15.439 --> 46:17.304
- Oh, no.
- She can do that.

46:17.374 --> 46:20.241
I can also track the whereabouts
of my toothbrush.

46:20.310 --> 46:23.302
I was not the one that left
the toothbrushes in Marrakech.

46:23.380 --> 46:26.349
I stowed them both
in the travel case, as instructed.

46:26.416 --> 46:30.546
Yes, and you also insisted
on loading the luggage into the taxi.

46:30.621 --> 46:33.715
- Didn't insist. I loaded the luggage.
- Not the travel case.

46:33.791 --> 46:36.988
Travel case is not luggage.
The case goes into the luggage.

46:37.060 --> 46:40.427
- Who was in charge of packing?
- I couldn't get the case into

46:40.497 --> 46:43.557
the luggage. It was full
with that stupid rug you bought.

46:43.634 --> 46:45.727
You thought it had secret stitching.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.237
- How stupid was that?
- Did have stitching.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.672
- Six phony green leather suitcases...
- Mom.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.968
I need you to take a look at this.

46:57.147 --> 46:59.672
- What is that a picture of?
- It's interesting.

46:59.783 --> 47:02.274
- We think it might be Olmec.
- It is.

47:03.554 --> 47:06.079
Yes, yes, definitely proto-Zoquean.

47:06.156 --> 47:09.319
We were hoping
that you could translate it.

47:10.060 --> 47:11.652
Yes, of course you were.

47:14.498 --> 47:17.831
Oh, this doesn't involve
another treasure hunt, does it?

47:17.901 --> 47:20.699
Mom, this is actually very important.

47:22.673 --> 47:25.107
All right. What have we got here?

47:25.843 --> 47:30.542
This... this glyph here,
that means "bird. " And that means...

47:36.486 --> 47:37.612
Uh, "noble bird. "

47:37.688 --> 47:40.885
"Find the noble bird,
let him take you by the hand

47:40.958 --> 47:44.223
and give you passage
to the sacred temple. "

47:50.934 --> 47:54.097
Oh, you think this is a treasure map
for Cíbola, don't you?

47:54.638 --> 47:56.503
Well, that is exactly what it is.

47:56.573 --> 48:00.703
No, this glyph doesn't mean "Cíbola. "
It means "the center of the world. "

48:00.811 --> 48:04.679
You know, you used to like it. She
fell in love with me on a treasure hunt.

48:04.715 --> 48:08.446
That was not love. That was
excitement, adrenaline and tequila.

48:08.447 --> 48:10.386
- Mom...
- I was trying to get course credit.

48:10.387 --> 48:13.914
Treasure hunting paid off,
in case you haven't read the papers.

48:13.991 --> 48:16.152
Had nothing to do with you.
That was Ben.

48:16.226 --> 48:18.524
Ben found the treasure.
You did nothing.

48:18.595 --> 48:23.498
Patrick, Emily, please. Can we
just figure out what's on the page?

48:26.136 --> 48:27.797
Well, that's it, I'm afraid.

48:28.505 --> 48:32.703
These glyphs are only partials.
So you only have half a treasure map.

48:33.844 --> 48:35.106
I'm sorry.

48:35.913 --> 48:37.380
Not that I'm surprised.

48:39.449 --> 48:41.940
At least we know
where the rest of the map is.

48:42.586 --> 48:43.917
What?

48:44.421 --> 48:46.753
You know where it is?
Why didn't you tell me?

48:46.823 --> 48:49.485
Obviously you have
a tendency to overreact!

48:53.163 --> 48:56.064
- I'm sorry.
- So am I.

48:56.133 --> 48:57.623
So where is it?

48:57.734 --> 49:02.330
Inscription on the statue in Paris said,
"These twins stand resolute. "

49:02.372 --> 49:05.899
We think the map's divided
between the two Resolute desks.

49:05.976 --> 49:09.503
The Resolute desk.
The Resolute desk?

49:09.579 --> 49:11.479
President's desk?

49:12.115 --> 49:13.878
The president. What president?

49:13.951 --> 49:16.886
- Our president?
- Unfortunately, yes.

49:16.954 --> 49:18.478
But that means...

49:18.555 --> 49:19.886
Wait, so we have to...

49:21.191 --> 49:22.351
The White House?

49:23.694 --> 49:27.221
The Oval Office... to be exact.

49:29.833 --> 49:31.630
Why would I overreact to that?

49:36.306 --> 49:40.140
- That's not what I signed on for.
- Could we focus on the issue at hand?

49:42.279 --> 49:43.268
Thank you.

49:47.217 --> 49:49.208
It's early, pre-Columbian.

49:49.286 --> 49:51.550
- Can you translate it?
- Are you kidding?

49:51.621 --> 49:54.920
This is an extinct,
exceedingly rare language.

49:54.992 --> 49:57.790
Only a handful of people
study these languages.

49:57.861 --> 49:59.260
Where are we to find them?

49:59.963 --> 50:03.330
Universities, I suppose.
But you don't have the whole thing.

50:03.400 --> 50:04.389
What do you mean?

50:05.135 --> 50:08.696
These glyphs here... they're cut off.

50:08.772 --> 50:11.942
There's more to the map?
How are we going to find that?

50:11.977 --> 50:14.877
We won't have to.
Gates will get it somehow.

50:15.212 --> 50:19.615
The Resolute desk is near
the south wall in the Oval Office.

50:19.683 --> 50:21.878
Look at this. Look.

50:21.952 --> 50:23.817
Small door on the front of the desk.

50:23.887 --> 50:27.345
FDR had that put in so
guests couldn't see his wheelchair.

50:27.424 --> 50:30.325
- But...
- Guys, take a look at this.

50:32.162 --> 50:33.595
This could work.

50:33.663 --> 50:37.394
I believe it's time for you to make
a date with your new boyfriend.

50:38.769 --> 50:39.929
I think you're right.

50:41.905 --> 50:46.467
<i>We hope you're enjoying
the White House Easter Egg Roll.</i>

50:46.543 --> 50:50.639
<i>Face painting continues at 2:00
near the south fountain.</i>

50:52.115 --> 50:55.676
- That Connor in the bunny suit?
- Thank you.

50:55.752 --> 50:58.880
I've never been to an Easter Egg Roll.
It's kind of sweet.

50:58.989 --> 51:00.616
Yeah, I love it.

51:02.159 --> 51:06.357
I know you. Your great-great-grandfather
killed President Lincoln.

51:06.430 --> 51:08.796
No. That would be John Wilkes Booth.

51:08.865 --> 51:11.026
Eisenschiml says that Booth was a tool

51:11.101 --> 51:14.537
in a greater conspiracy
that involved men in Lincoln's Cabinet.

51:14.604 --> 51:16.970
Absurd.
Eisenschiml's book is filled with

51:17.040 --> 51:20.009
- spotty research and false assumptions.
- Oh, yeah?

51:20.077 --> 51:23.205
Explain why Lincoln's bodyguard
left his post that night?

51:23.280 --> 51:26.681
Because President Lincoln
was never accompanied by guards

51:26.750 --> 51:30.277
when attending the theater. Listening?
Especially on Good Friday.

51:30.353 --> 51:33.322
Explain why all the bridges
out of Washington were closed

51:33.390 --> 51:36.553
except one,
the one Booth needed to escape?

51:36.626 --> 51:39.595
OK, run along now,
you impossible child. Run along.

51:41.231 --> 51:43.791
What is going on
with the education in America?

51:43.867 --> 51:46.836
- Hey! Hey!
- Connor!

51:46.903 --> 51:49.371
- I'm so glad you decided to come...
- Hey.

51:49.439 --> 51:51.999
...with Gates.
- Connor.

51:52.075 --> 51:54.134
- We just ran into each other.
- Oh.

51:58.115 --> 51:59.707
Aren't you going to ask him?

51:59.783 --> 52:01.273
- Ask me what?
- Nothing.

52:01.351 --> 52:04.479
- No, really. What?
- I really wouldn't want to impose.

52:04.988 --> 52:09.687
Well, what she means is
she doesn't think you can.

52:09.759 --> 52:12.887
- Doesn't think I can what?
- She wants to see the Oval Office.

52:12.963 --> 52:16.831
- No. That is way too much to ask.
- No, it's, uh...

52:18.768 --> 52:20.030
- I can do that.
- Really?

52:20.103 --> 52:21.092
You see?

52:21.738 --> 52:23.069
- You can?
- Yeah.

52:23.140 --> 52:27.440
That is so cool, Connor. I have
always wanted to see the Oval Office.

52:27.511 --> 52:29.172
Connor rocks.

52:29.846 --> 52:32.872
Well... here we are.

52:32.949 --> 52:35.315
- Mm.
- Wow.

52:35.752 --> 52:40.018
Empire furnishings
and crenelated molding. Love it.

52:40.090 --> 52:41.921
Hm.

52:41.992 --> 52:44.893
Amazing feeling, isn't it,
standing in here?

52:44.961 --> 52:47.953
- Yes. Amazing, huh?
- Oh, could...

52:48.031 --> 52:49.157
Oh. Sorry.

52:51.801 --> 52:55.430
Oh, that's, uh... The Resolute desk.

52:56.106 --> 52:59.166
Might recognize it from
the photo of young JFK Junior

52:59.276 --> 53:01.836
playing underneath
while his father was working.

53:01.878 --> 53:03.778
- Wonderful.
- Yeah.

53:03.847 --> 53:06.748
But many people don't know

53:06.816 --> 53:10.274
that this desk has a twin
that sits in Buckingham Palace.

53:10.353 --> 53:12.378
- Isn't that something?
- Who knew?

53:12.455 --> 53:14.719
Every president since
Rutherford B. Hayes

53:14.791 --> 53:17.726
has used that desk,
except, uh, Johnson and Nixon.

53:17.794 --> 53:19.261
And Ford, of course.

53:19.396 --> 53:21.830
- Uh, no.
- Uh, yes.

53:21.898 --> 53:23.923
- No.
- Yes.

53:24.000 --> 53:26.730
Abigail! Did you lose an earring?

53:27.604 --> 53:30.437
Oh! I... I did, yes.

53:30.507 --> 53:33.772
Connor, these were given to me
by my grandmother.

53:33.843 --> 53:37.643
I suppose we should look for it.
Wouldn't want anyone finding an earring

53:37.714 --> 53:40.649
that doesn't belong
to the first lady in the Oval Office.

53:40.717 --> 53:42.082
- Yes.
- Excellent point,

53:42.152 --> 53:44.450
considering we're not
supposed to be here.

53:44.521 --> 53:47.752
- Yeah.
- Why don't we, um, go over here

53:47.824 --> 53:49.155
and check it out?

53:50.927 --> 53:52.861
I'll check over here.

54:01.838 --> 54:04.398
- Do you think it fell down here?
- Yes.

54:11.014 --> 54:14.450
- Maybe here.
- Probably.

54:22.525 --> 54:24.186
Oh, no.

54:29.532 --> 54:33.366
- You did sit on the sofa.
- Oh, the bunnies.

54:38.742 --> 54:40.403
Connor!

54:40.477 --> 54:44.641
- You found it.
- I did.

54:54.557 --> 54:56.548
Thank you so much!

54:56.993 --> 54:58.460
Uh...

54:59.296 --> 55:02.094
You're just the best. Mm.

55:06.136 --> 55:07.228
Mm!

55:12.809 --> 55:14.140
Mm!

55:14.944 --> 55:16.206
Mm!

55:20.884 --> 55:22.044
Thank you.

55:25.288 --> 55:26.285
OK.

55:28.858 --> 55:31.122
- Empty.
- Someone must've taken it.

55:31.194 --> 55:34.789
Brightest men in our country sat
at that desk for over a hundred years.

55:34.864 --> 55:36.991
- Look.
- Course one of 'em found the map.

55:37.067 --> 55:40.559
- A symbol stamped into the wood.
- The presidential seal.

55:40.637 --> 55:42.537
It's not the presidential seal.

55:42.605 --> 55:46.268
The eagle's holding a scroll
instead of olive branches.

55:46.343 --> 55:49.244
- I'm not sure what this is.
- What do we do?

55:49.312 --> 55:50.904
Did none of you read my book?

55:52.816 --> 55:55.080
The eagle clutching the scroll.

55:55.452 --> 55:57.249
- Do you know what it means?
- Yeah.

55:57.320 --> 55:59.447
But it's not something I could tell you.

56:00.523 --> 56:04.459
It's something that
I have to show you... in my book.

56:10.767 --> 56:14.464
- You didn't even open it?
- I was moving.

56:14.537 --> 56:16.095
Chapter 13.

56:20.910 --> 56:25.176
- "The President's Secret Book"?
- "The President's Secret Book. "

56:25.248 --> 56:29.412
It happens to be a collection
of documents for presidents

56:29.486 --> 56:32.887
by presidents,
and for presidents' eyes only.

56:33.289 --> 56:36.690
And I'm not just talking about
JFK here, guys.

56:36.760 --> 56:41.197
The 18 and a half missing minutes
of the Watergate tapes.

56:41.898 --> 56:45.994
Did the Apollo really land
on the moon? Did it? Did it?

56:46.069 --> 56:50.028
And the coup de grâce... Area 51.

56:50.106 --> 56:53.234
Come on, Riley. That's...
that's an urban legend.

56:53.309 --> 56:56.244
Is it, Abigail? Is it?

56:57.280 --> 56:58.474
It's just totally...

56:58.581 --> 56:59.809
- Crazy?
- Yeah.

56:59.849 --> 57:04.650
Hm. 'Cause last time I checked,
we pretty much make our living on crazy.

57:04.721 --> 57:07.884
- He's got a point.
- I guess so.

57:09.492 --> 57:10.516
Same symbol.

57:10.593 --> 57:13.994
Released in '66 under
the Freedom of Information Act.

57:14.063 --> 57:15.792
The eagle and the scroll,

57:15.865 --> 57:20.131
the secret symbol
in the President's Book.

57:20.203 --> 57:23.001
So you're saying that
whatever was on that plank

57:23.072 --> 57:25.973
is now in the President's Secret Book?

57:28.278 --> 57:29.677
Ben.

57:30.346 --> 57:32.439
If it was you trying to convince me...

57:33.349 --> 57:36.944
...you'd have less evidence,
and I'd already believe you by now.

57:41.658 --> 57:43.387
The eagle with the scroll?

57:45.762 --> 57:48.162
Conspiracy theorists like to believe

57:48.231 --> 57:51.098
that it's the symbol
for the President's Secret Book.

57:51.167 --> 57:52.759
You bought Riley's book.

57:52.836 --> 57:56.237
Your friend writes a book
about government conspiracies.

57:56.306 --> 57:58.774
- You don't think we know about it?
- But is it true?

57:58.875 --> 58:01.275
Does the president have a secret book?

58:08.184 --> 58:09.446
Do you like ducks?

58:12.922 --> 58:14.116
There is a book.

58:15.658 --> 58:17.455
Why are you telling me out here?

58:18.628 --> 58:21.096
Because inside, I'm a federal agent.

58:21.164 --> 58:23.428
Out here,
I'm talking to you as a friend.

58:23.500 --> 58:27.903
- Where's the President's Book kept?
- Only the current president knows.

58:27.971 --> 58:30.565
The book is passed
from president to president,

58:30.640 --> 58:32.904
and each one chooses
his own hiding place.

58:32.976 --> 58:35.001
You're the FBI.
Can't you get it for me?

58:35.078 --> 58:38.639
Only way you'll ever see that book
is if you get elected president.

58:39.682 --> 58:41.081
Well, you never know.

58:42.952 --> 58:45.182
All I need is a few minutes with him.

58:46.055 --> 58:47.852
A few minutes? Really?

58:47.924 --> 58:50.154
Even if you were married
to the president,

58:50.226 --> 58:52.490
you wouldn't be able
to get a few minutes.

58:52.562 --> 58:55.554
Not when he's surrounded by handlers.
If I get him alone...

58:55.632 --> 58:57.930
How do you expect
to get the president alone?

58:58.034 --> 59:01.128
Before the Civil War,
the states were all separate.

59:01.471 --> 59:04.963
People used to say, "The
United States are. " Are

59:05.542 --> 59:10.343
Wasn't until the war ended people
started saying, "The United States is. "

59:12.181 --> 59:16.743
Under Lincoln... we became one nation.

59:16.819 --> 59:18.980
And Lincoln paid for it with his life.

59:19.055 --> 59:21.546
- So did Thomas Gates.
- Right.

59:22.692 --> 59:23.954
With his life.

59:25.428 --> 59:29.421
So how am I gonna get him alone?

59:33.136 --> 59:34.398
I'm gonna kidnap him.

59:36.039 --> 59:39.031
I'm gonna kidnap
the president of the United States.

59:42.712 --> 59:44.805
- That's not funny.
- I'm your father.

59:44.881 --> 59:48.112
How do you expect me to respond?
I can't let you ruin your life.

59:48.184 --> 59:50.175
Are you out of your mind?

59:50.253 --> 59:53.313
Read my book, and you'd know
you can't get to that book.

59:53.389 --> 59:55.789
Exactly how do you plan on doing this?

59:57.126 --> 01:00:00.022
- I was thinking Mount Vernon.
- Oh.

01:00:00.096 --> 01:00:02.291
- What?
- I'm in.

01:00:02.465 --> 01:00:05.229
Sir, we have to move the party.

01:00:05.368 --> 01:00:08.201
Some historian claims
the Spencer Landmark Hotel

01:00:08.271 --> 01:00:10.762
was used for Klan meetings
in the late 1800s.

01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.298
<i>- Anyone know if this is true?
- I've got the Washington Gazette.</i>

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:18.473
They want a quote on, "Is the president
being insensitive to minority issues?"

01:00:18.548 --> 01:00:21.676
- Doesn't matter.
- Get a list of approved alternates.

01:00:21.751 --> 01:00:24.413
- What do you have?
- Yeah, I know it's short notice.

01:00:24.487 --> 01:00:28.184
The pipe burst in the hotel
that we previously booked.

01:00:28.257 --> 01:00:33.285
- I... There is water everywhere.
- A retirement party for 200 people.

01:00:33.363 --> 01:00:36.127
- Gunston Hall.
- Monticello is booked.

01:00:36.199 --> 01:00:38.463
So is Gunston Hall and Tudor Place.

01:00:38.534 --> 01:00:41.901
The Denby Hotel is available,
and so is Mount Vernon.

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:46.135
- Oh, wow. You are a lifesaver.
- The Denby is great.

01:00:46.209 --> 01:00:49.406
Strike that. The Denby was booked.
Mount Vernon's all we got.

01:00:49.479 --> 01:00:51.674
Book it before someone else does.

01:00:56.386 --> 01:00:58.980
And let me say
what an honor it is to be here

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:01.386
and add my happy birthday to you,
Mr. President.

01:01:31.654 --> 01:01:33.713
- Good evening, sir.
- Good evening.

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:36.452
Are you aware that you are
in a restricted area?

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:39.051
Yeah, but this is
where the fish are, son.

01:01:39.128 --> 01:01:42.564
That may be, but I'm gonna
need to have you move upriver.

01:01:47.437 --> 01:01:50.770
Are you aware that according
to article one, section 25

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:54.435
of the Maryland constitution,
I'm allowed to fish in public water?

01:01:54.510 --> 01:01:59.379
Are you aware I have the right to detain
you for the next 48 hours without cause?

01:02:00.083 --> 01:02:04.520
I am going to go back where
I came from just as fast as possible.

01:02:11.928 --> 01:02:15.625
Maybe one day I'll wear this thing
to a party I was actually invited to.

01:02:25.408 --> 01:02:28.309
Twenty hundred time check. Station 11.

01:02:28.377 --> 01:02:30.937
<i>- All clear. Perimeter secure.
- Hey.</i>

01:02:31.013 --> 01:02:34.346
You didn't happen to see
a cute brunette wandering around?

01:02:34.417 --> 01:02:37.511
- Went to get a drink, she disappeared.
- No, sir.

01:02:38.254 --> 01:02:39.744
I've got no game tonight.

01:02:46.562 --> 01:02:50.658
Good evening, Your Excellency. Hello.

01:02:50.733 --> 01:02:54.760
Prime Minister, it's a delight
to have you back in the States.

01:02:54.837 --> 01:02:58.967
Spread the word, contribution limits
not enforced on the president's birth...

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:00.633
- Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

01:03:00.676 --> 01:03:04.407
- Ben Gates. The Templar treasure?
- Oh, right, Ben Gates. Yeah.

01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:07.745
- We won't keep you.
- Thanks so much. Always a pleasure.

01:03:07.817 --> 01:03:12.151
I can't tell you what a thrill it is
for me to be invited here tonight, sir.

01:03:12.221 --> 01:03:16.089
Yeah, you must have
the Secret Service hopping about now.

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.490
Sir?

01:03:17.560 --> 01:03:19.619
Considering your discovered lineage.

01:03:19.695 --> 01:03:22.220
- Oh, yeah. Oh, that...
- Carry on.

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:25.495
I beg your pardon, sir,
but I know what a huge admirer you are

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:29.561
of George Washington. I thought
you might want to take a look at this.

01:03:29.639 --> 01:03:31.197
Have a look at that.

01:03:31.274 --> 01:03:34.869
This is a map of Mount Vernon
drawn by George Washington himself.

01:03:34.944 --> 01:03:37.811
Mr. President,
that is exactly what it is.

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:41.646
- Architectural history major, Yale.
- I did not know that.

01:03:41.717 --> 01:03:43.514
It belonged to my great uncle.

01:03:43.515 --> 01:03:45.787
Got it from the granddaughter
of a slave, Charlotte.

01:03:45.788 --> 01:03:49.087
- Happy birthday.
- Always a pleasure. Thank you so much.

01:03:49.158 --> 01:03:52.719
Charlotte, who lived here
and worked here at Mount Vernon.

01:03:52.795 --> 01:03:56.162
- Yeah.
- And we're standing right here, sir.

01:03:56.232 --> 01:04:00.498
This line is an underground tunnel,
an escape route that was never found.

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:04.232
I wonder...
I wonder if it's still there.

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:07.402
Well...

01:04:07.476 --> 01:04:11.173
- Only one way to find out, sir.
- Maybe we should take a look.

01:04:11.948 --> 01:04:13.472
Are we allowed to do that?

01:04:13.850 --> 01:04:17.251
I mean, I know you're allowed
to do that. You're the president.

01:04:17.320 --> 01:04:18.582
Can I come with you?

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:22.885
- You guys are just everywhere.
- Yes, sir.

01:04:22.959 --> 01:04:25.484
- Give my friend your flashlight.
- Thank you.

01:04:27.096 --> 01:04:29.360
According to this map, it should be...

01:04:30.433 --> 01:04:34.426
It's one... two. In here.

01:04:34.503 --> 01:04:36.130
Yeah, should be in here.

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:39.169
- May I?
- Absolutely.

01:04:39.242 --> 01:04:40.732
All right.

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:47.549
You know, Craig,
I appreciate you doing your job,

01:04:47.617 --> 01:04:49.608
but I have no enemies down here.

01:04:50.419 --> 01:04:53.445
In the cellar. In this tiny little room.

01:04:54.757 --> 01:04:56.224
I'll just wait here, then.

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.693
Over here.

01:05:12.108 --> 01:05:15.976
- That's the mark of George Washington.
- Only it's slightly different.

01:05:16.045 --> 01:05:19.606
- How?
- These axes, the angle's off.

01:05:20.549 --> 01:05:26.385
For it to correspond with the ones on
the map, it should form a perfect V.

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:33.789
OK, what else?

01:05:34.730 --> 01:05:36.630
The arrowhead...

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:40.898
...is sideways.

01:05:48.644 --> 01:05:50.703
We're all right.
Don't worry.

01:05:56.118 --> 01:05:57.415
Look at that.

01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.209
Come on.

01:06:05.461 --> 01:06:06.450
Mr. President?

01:06:08.030 --> 01:06:10.590
We have a breach
in zone nine! There's...

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:17.002
- Inform Fairfax, SecTac Channel One!
- Perimeter detail, lock down all exits!

01:06:17.673 --> 01:06:20.642
- Gates, what are you doing?
- I'm sorry, Mr. President.

01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.441
I need to ask you a question,
which I know you can't answer

01:06:24.513 --> 01:06:27.311
- unless we're alone.
- Two coming in!

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:31.576
I want a sledgehammer, I want a crowbar,
I want a jackhammer, now!

01:06:33.122 --> 01:06:35.113
Tom, alert the vice president.

01:06:36.325 --> 01:06:38.919
Mr. President, sometime between 1880,

01:06:38.995 --> 01:06:42.089
when the Resolute desk
was placed in the Oval Office,

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:46.658
and now, one of our presidents found
a secret compartment in the desk.

01:06:46.736 --> 01:06:50.502
Hidden inside was a plank
with Native American writing on it.

01:06:50.573 --> 01:06:55.340
A treasure map to Cíbola,
the legendary City of Gold, sir.

01:06:55.411 --> 01:06:57.743
All this just to ask me
about a treasure map?

01:06:57.847 --> 01:07:01.214
That map is a key to proving
Thomas Gates' innocence.

01:07:01.250 --> 01:07:05.516
I know for a fact that the plank
is no longer in the Resolute desk.

01:07:05.588 --> 01:07:07.112
You've been in my desk too?

01:07:07.189 --> 01:07:10.249
I believe the whereabouts
of that plank is now hidden...

01:07:11.093 --> 01:07:13.118
...in the President's Book, sir.

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:18.124
The book known only to our presidents.

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:21.726
It contains all of our nation's secrets.

01:07:26.542 --> 01:07:29.272
That's the most
ridiculous thing I've ever heard.

01:07:29.345 --> 01:07:35.215
I saw the seal in the desk, sir.
I know the map exists.

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:39.277
You're not going to tell me
how to get out of here

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:42.722
- unless you get what you want.
- The way out is that direction,

01:07:42.792 --> 01:07:44.623
and I'll show you.

01:07:44.693 --> 01:07:46.752
You don't negotiate very well, do you?

01:07:47.797 --> 01:07:49.025
No, sir.

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:50.825
Mr. President!

01:07:50.900 --> 01:07:52.595
Where are my sledgehammers?

01:07:58.474 --> 01:07:59.736
I don't get you, Gates.

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:02.639
You do all this,
you're willing to go to prison,

01:08:02.711 --> 01:08:05.009
just to clear your ancestor's name.

01:08:05.714 --> 01:08:08.148
The way out is just down those stairs.

01:08:09.351 --> 01:08:12.320
Everything I am
is because of my ancestors, sir.

01:08:13.122 --> 01:08:15.886
Thomas Gates gave his
last full measure of devotion

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:18.551
to his country to stop the KGC.

01:08:18.627 --> 01:08:22.426
When someone dies for their country,
I believe they should be honored.

01:08:22.497 --> 01:08:24.363
"Last full measure of devotion"?

01:08:25.033 --> 01:08:27.901
Lincoln is my favorite president, sir.
No offense.

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:32.470
None taken. He's my favorite too.

01:08:34.276 --> 01:08:37.473
Sir, I know the book exists,
and my question is,

01:08:37.546 --> 01:08:40.912
"Will you agree to let me see it?"

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:44.246
Even if something like that
really did exist,

01:08:44.319 --> 01:08:47.220
why do you think I would
actually just give it to you?

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:49.688
Because it will probably lead us

01:08:49.758 --> 01:08:53.854
to the discovery of the greatest
Native American treasure of all time.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:57.488
A huge piece of culture lost.

01:08:57.600 --> 01:09:00.660
You can give that history
back to its descendants.

01:09:00.703 --> 01:09:04.901
And because you're the president
of the United States, sir.

01:09:04.974 --> 01:09:09.843
Whether by innate character, or the oath
you took to defend the Constitution,

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:12.813
or the weight of history
that falls upon you.

01:09:13.482 --> 01:09:16.417
I believe you
to be an honorable man, sir.

01:09:18.453 --> 01:09:20.819
People don't believe that stuff anymore.

01:09:22.825 --> 01:09:24.349
They want to believe it.

01:09:46.549 --> 01:09:51.384
Nearest highway is that direction.
You'll understand if we part ways here.

01:09:56.358 --> 01:09:58.758
- Gates.
- Sir?

01:09:58.827 --> 01:10:01.887
The following conversation
never happened.

01:10:03.265 --> 01:10:04.732
The book exists.

01:10:05.901 --> 01:10:08.335
- Where is it?
- Where else do you keep a book?

01:10:08.404 --> 01:10:10.235
In the Library of Congress.

01:10:10.973 --> 01:10:15.672
X, Y, two, three, four,
seven, eight, six.

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:17.035
Thank you, sir.

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:22.916
You'll also need to know
three, seven, nine, four.

01:10:22.985 --> 01:10:24.282
Got it.

01:10:25.354 --> 01:10:28.983
- And, Gates...
- Sir?

01:10:29.525 --> 01:10:34.360
Two hundred people know you held me
against my will. I can't tell them why.

01:10:34.430 --> 01:10:36.762
Unless you find what you're looking for,

01:10:36.832 --> 01:10:39.630
you'll be charged
with kidnapping the president.

01:10:39.702 --> 01:10:44.071
- You know what that means.
- Yes, sir. Very much so, sir.

01:10:47.943 --> 01:10:51.606
- I want you to do something for me.
- It would be a privilege, sir.

01:10:52.481 --> 01:10:56.508
Page 47. Just have a look at that.

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:02.952
Riley, meet me at the
Library of Congress in 20 minutes.

01:11:05.661 --> 01:11:06.650
OK.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:14.925
Sadusky.

01:11:17.606 --> 01:11:20.442
The president's been what?

01:11:22.845 --> 01:11:23.834
Gates.

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:31.442
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:35.923
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.
X- Y-two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

01:11:35.991 --> 01:11:37.618
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:11:38.027 --> 01:11:39.392
We're close.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.963
- Where do we start?
- XY is the book classification code.

01:11:53.042 --> 01:11:56.534
Stands for special collections,
which means very special books.

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.581
- Where are they?
- This way. We'll sneak in.

01:12:22.538 --> 01:12:23.527
This will be good.

01:12:26.475 --> 01:12:28.966
Here we go. XA... XM...

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:37.418
Look. Do you have a code?

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:40.552
Three-seven-nine-four.

01:12:47.296 --> 01:12:49.594
What did the president say
the number was?

01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:51.860
Two-three-four-seven-eight-six.

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:01.967
Two-three-six-seven...

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:05.104
X- Y-two-three-three,
two-three-seven-eight... Here.

01:13:05.180 --> 01:13:06.841
Two-three-four-seven-nine-one.

01:13:06.982 --> 01:13:09.815
- Two-three-four-seven-nine...
- Seventy-six, 78...

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.182
It's not there.

01:13:13.122 --> 01:13:15.784
Maybe someone checked it out.

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:21.590
- Why send us here if there's no book?
- He probably wanted us to get caught.

01:13:31.407 --> 01:13:32.396
Here.

01:13:48.957 --> 01:13:51.824
- What is that?
- It's a six-dial combination lock.

01:13:53.896 --> 01:13:55.796
The location is the combination.

01:13:57.132 --> 01:13:58.929
The location is the combination.

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:18.052
Yes. I was right.

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:20.353
Well done, Mr. Poole.

01:14:27.529 --> 01:14:29.121
Eagle and the scroll.

01:14:41.910 --> 01:14:43.434
- Area 51!
- Shh!

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:49.073
- Kennedy assassination.
- Shh! We don't have time.

01:14:49.151 --> 01:14:51.176
Yeah, it's true.

01:14:54.189 --> 01:14:56.851
Here. Wait.

01:14:56.925 --> 01:15:01.089
"April 1865. Queen Victoria
sends Pike two coded missives.

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:05.633
The first is received.
Contains information regarding

01:15:05.667 --> 01:15:09.103
New World treasure. The City of Gold. "

01:15:09.705 --> 01:15:13.072
Wait. The queen
wanted to help the Confederacy?

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:16.770
- A divided America'd have been weaker.
- Needed cotton from the South.

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:20.008
"The second missive was thought
to contain a Playfair cipher

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:24.018
suggesting contact with Laboulaye,
who'll hide clues before his death. "

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:27.817
The cipher written into the Booth
diary page that Thomas tried to burn.

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:30.188
- The one we have.
- Exactly. "1880.

01:15:30.959 --> 01:15:35.157
Resolute desk arrives in Washington,
sent by queen to President Hayes. "

01:15:37.199 --> 01:15:38.188
Look at that.

01:15:39.968 --> 01:15:43.233
Missing plank from the White House. Wow.

01:15:45.207 --> 01:15:47.767
Here's the final entry
by President Coolidge.

01:15:47.843 --> 01:15:51.904
"1924. I found a plank
in secret desk compartment.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:55.677
Plank photographed and then destroyed.

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:58.549
Borglum commissioned
to destroy landmarks

01:15:58.654 --> 01:16:00.747
in sacred Black Hills mountains. "

01:16:03.358 --> 01:16:06.987
Borglum. Mount Rushmore?

01:16:07.663 --> 01:16:12.657
He carved Mount Rushmore
to erase the map's landmarks

01:16:12.734 --> 01:16:15.202
in order to protect the City of Gold.

01:16:16.238 --> 01:16:18.866
Mount Rushmore was a cover-up.

01:16:18.941 --> 01:16:21.705
What is it?

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:26.679
There's my tax dollars at work,
coming to arrest me.

01:16:26.748 --> 01:16:29.376
Not coming for you,
they're for me. Go to the car.

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:31.351
- No!
- Go! I'll meet up with you.

01:16:31.920 --> 01:16:32.909
This way.

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:44.163
So Gates abducts the president,
lets him go

01:16:44.232 --> 01:16:46.223
and heads to the Library of Congress?

01:16:46.301 --> 01:16:48.929
- Why?
- Maybe he wants to check out a book.

01:17:08.357 --> 01:17:09.915
This way.

01:17:30.812 --> 01:17:33.280
<i>All agents...</i>

01:17:45.994 --> 01:17:47.825
- Dad.
- Ben.

01:17:47.896 --> 01:17:50.160
Get out of there.
I had to move the car.

01:17:50.232 --> 01:17:52.632
FBI, Secret Service all over the place.

01:17:52.701 --> 01:17:55.465
Calm down. I sent a picture
of the plank to your cell.

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.471
- You can do that?
- Yes, I can do that.

01:17:57.572 --> 01:17:59.199
<i>Did you get it?</i>

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.339
<i>- I got it.
- Look.</i>

01:18:03.045 --> 01:18:07.106
<i>- Take it to Mom for translation.
- Why me?</i>

01:18:07.182 --> 01:18:09.241
He say his mom
could translate the plank?

01:18:09.317 --> 01:18:11.217
Find out who she is.

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:25.161
- How are we going to find Ben?
- I don't know.

01:18:25.233 --> 01:18:27.133
- Hold it! Who are you?
- We work here.

01:18:27.202 --> 01:18:29.397
- IDs.
- Here. We were told to evacuate.

01:18:29.471 --> 01:18:31.166
I don't know what's going on.

01:18:31.239 --> 01:18:33.833
- My car's parked...
- One second I'm reading...

01:18:33.909 --> 01:18:37.401
- Special section for...
... a book, then we're rushed out...

01:18:37.479 --> 01:18:39.037
- Go ahead.
- OK. Thank you.

01:18:39.114 --> 01:18:42.208
- Thank you for your help, officer.
- Best of luck.

01:18:42.718 --> 01:18:45.516
Have a good night.

01:18:49.124 --> 01:18:52.355
Hey, go
to the northeast sectors...

01:18:55.831 --> 01:18:57.162
Start the car.

01:19:00.235 --> 01:19:01.395
Put it in gear.

01:19:03.405 --> 01:19:05.339
- Uh-oh.
- What's the problem?

01:19:05.407 --> 01:19:06.533
It's clear. Let's go!

01:19:07.142 --> 01:19:08.439
We're going to jail.

01:19:11.546 --> 01:19:13.309
I want to run a check...

01:19:16.218 --> 01:19:17.515
Get in! Hang on!

01:19:19.121 --> 01:19:20.349
Mercedes SUV...

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.982
- He's in! Go!
- Hang on!

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:24.685
Whoa!

01:19:25.961 --> 01:19:27.053
OK. We can do this.

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:33.393
Close the barricade, lock it down!

01:19:33.468 --> 01:19:35.561
<i>Lock it down!</i>

01:19:38.273 --> 01:19:40.104
- Drive, drive, drive!
- OK.

01:19:42.277 --> 01:19:43.938
I don't think so!

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:45.874
Whoa, whoa!

01:19:50.318 --> 01:19:52.650
Go, go, go, go, go!

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.985
Let's go! Let's go!

01:19:57.559 --> 01:20:00.050
That did not turn out
the way it was supposed to!

01:20:00.128 --> 01:20:02.790
- How'd they find us so quick?
- I'll tell you how.

01:20:02.864 --> 01:20:06.527
- The president is a tattletale!
- Sadusky. He was there.

01:20:06.601 --> 01:20:08.933
He knows more about the book
than I thought.

01:20:09.004 --> 01:20:11.697
How'd the president
feel about being kidnapped?

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:13.366
He was OK.

01:20:19.783 --> 01:20:22.718
- Dr. Appleton.
- This office is closed. I'm sorry.

01:20:22.786 --> 01:20:25.254
I do apologize
for the lateness of the hour.

01:20:26.623 --> 01:20:28.818
My name is Mitch Wilkinson.

01:20:28.892 --> 01:20:32.521
I've got something I want you
to take a look at. Just take a minute.

01:20:40.303 --> 01:20:42.601
- You're a treasure hunter.
- No, ma'am.

01:20:42.672 --> 01:20:45.436
I'm just a man trying
to make his mark on history.

01:20:45.976 --> 01:20:47.307
Can you help me?

01:20:48.712 --> 01:20:52.978
Um... No, I don't know that language.
I'm sorry. I can't help you.

01:20:53.083 --> 01:20:55.608
Oh, excuse me.

01:20:58.755 --> 01:20:59.847
Yes.

01:21:01.458 --> 01:21:02.925
Got it.

01:21:03.527 --> 01:21:07.293
Your ex-husband's on his way up.
He wants the translation.

01:21:08.732 --> 01:21:13.897
Tell him anything but the truth.
Get rid of him. His life depends on it.

01:21:23.547 --> 01:21:25.105
Emily?

01:21:37.828 --> 01:21:40.058
I know I'm the last person
you want to see,

01:21:40.130 --> 01:21:45.397
and I'm not comfortable either,
but we need you to translate something.

01:21:47.170 --> 01:21:51.402
- Ben sent me. He needs your help.
- Yes, of course.

01:21:52.709 --> 01:21:54.700
If it's for Ben, of course. What is it?

01:21:55.779 --> 01:21:58.111
Oh. Uh...

01:21:58.181 --> 01:22:00.945
It's in the cell phone.
I'm not sure how to...

01:22:01.017 --> 01:22:03.008
- Give it to me.
... bring it out.

01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:13.294
We know it leads to Mount Rushmore.

01:22:17.367 --> 01:22:20.564
Yes. "Islands...
Islands of stone in a sea of grass. "

01:22:20.637 --> 01:22:25.267
That's what the Lakota used to call
the Black Hills in South Dakota.

01:22:25.976 --> 01:22:26.965
Right.

01:22:30.247 --> 01:22:34.650
"Find where the moon touches the earth
and release the hummingbird. "

01:22:39.222 --> 01:22:40.280
That's it?

01:22:47.898 --> 01:22:52.232
Did it ever occur to you?
I can't believe I'm saying this.

01:22:53.436 --> 01:22:57.372
Did it ever occur to you that I did
the things I did to impress you?

01:23:00.143 --> 01:23:04.011
No, you did it because you wanted to,
and I would've done the same thing,

01:23:04.080 --> 01:23:07.413
except one of us had to grow up
and stay home and look after Ben.

01:23:07.484 --> 01:23:09.475
Certainly wasn't going to be you.

01:23:10.353 --> 01:23:14.813
Did it ever occur to you that I made
sacrifices for us that you never did?

01:23:17.427 --> 01:23:18.985
No, of course not.

01:23:19.462 --> 01:23:21.293
So just go away.

01:23:35.378 --> 01:23:36.868
Lousy tequila.

01:23:41.451 --> 01:23:43.681
Don't feel bad. You did good.

01:23:43.753 --> 01:23:45.812
Patrick believed every word you said.

01:23:45.889 --> 01:23:49.450
Besides, your son would have
never found the treasure anyway.

01:23:49.526 --> 01:23:51.357
You don't know Benjamin.

01:23:51.428 --> 01:23:54.989
Perhaps not.
But then again, I have this.

01:23:58.635 --> 01:24:03.504
A letter from Queen Victoria to
the Confederate General Albert Pike?

01:24:03.573 --> 01:24:07.839
Seems the dear old queen
was partial to the Confederate cause.

01:24:08.545 --> 01:24:11.480
This has been handed down
by my family for 140 years.

01:24:12.315 --> 01:24:16.615
Contains a vital piece of information.
The final clue, as it were.

01:24:16.686 --> 01:24:22.556
This piece of information is worthless
without your translation of the planks.

01:24:24.060 --> 01:24:25.823
It's ironic, isn't it?

01:24:25.895 --> 01:24:30.662
This all began with the burning
of pages, and now it ends

01:24:30.734 --> 01:24:34.261
with the burning of this,
the final clue.

01:24:35.105 --> 01:24:36.834
Making me the only one...

01:24:38.041 --> 01:24:39.538
...who can find Cíbola.

01:24:41.811 --> 01:24:42.869
Get your coat.

01:24:55.759 --> 01:24:58.751
Her translation on the second half
of the planks says

01:24:58.828 --> 01:25:02.389
- we need to find an island of stone.
- Ben would have found it by now.

01:25:02.799 --> 01:25:04.061
I don't think so.

01:25:11.875 --> 01:25:13.706
How do I get to, um, this...

01:25:15.578 --> 01:25:16.806
Hello, Mitch.

01:25:18.481 --> 01:25:19.539
Mom...

01:25:19.616 --> 01:25:22.483
- Wait for me.
- No way. You're too slow.

01:25:22.819 --> 01:25:25.811
I knew you'd figure out
the message I gave your father.

01:25:26.222 --> 01:25:29.191
The hummingbird was good. Let her go.

01:25:29.259 --> 01:25:32.990
We're the ones with the firepower,
and you're giving me orders.

01:25:33.063 --> 01:25:37.329
I kidnapped the president. The FBI
is on their way right now to arrest me,

01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:39.425
and I'm sure they'll love to meet you.

01:25:39.502 --> 01:25:41.629
They'll find us both and arrest us both.

01:25:41.705 --> 01:25:44.435
That path doesn't lead
to the City of Gold, does it?

01:25:44.674 --> 01:25:47.575
This man has information you need.
He's got a letter.

01:25:47.644 --> 01:25:50.010
From Queen Victoria
to General Albert Pike.

01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:52.947
- How do you know that?
- I read about it, in a book.

01:25:56.019 --> 01:25:57.486
I'm afraid he's burned it.

01:26:00.790 --> 01:26:05.489
All right... You've had me do
all the work so far, why stop now?

01:26:06.129 --> 01:26:09.462
You tell me what you know,
I'll find the City of Gold,

01:26:09.532 --> 01:26:12.763
prove Thomas Gates' innocence,
you can have the treasure.

01:26:12.836 --> 01:26:14.736
- What?
- I'm going with you.

01:26:14.804 --> 01:26:18.570
But if anyone's gonna be credited
for discovering the City of Gold,

01:26:18.641 --> 01:26:19.903
it's going to be me.

01:26:19.976 --> 01:26:23.070
But your partners stay here,
and all the guns.

01:26:23.146 --> 01:26:24.807
What makes you think I'd agree?

01:26:25.715 --> 01:26:30.243
Because you need that treasure.
Believe me, I know.

01:26:34.824 --> 01:26:37.054
All right, Gates. We'll do it your way.

01:26:39.963 --> 01:26:43.831
But believe me... I don't need the guns.

01:26:48.772 --> 01:26:52.572
- Which president? The president?
- I thought it best not to tell you.

01:27:05.889 --> 01:27:09.552
I still don't see anything
that looks like a noble bird.

01:27:11.494 --> 01:27:13.462
All right. Let's have it.

01:27:13.530 --> 01:27:17.967
What did the letter say? What's
the clue from Queen Victoria's letter?

01:27:18.034 --> 01:27:23.336
"The entrance shall only be revealed
under a cloudless rain. "

01:27:23.406 --> 01:27:24.998
Figure that one out.

01:27:25.074 --> 01:27:28.703
So we come back when it's raining?

01:27:30.713 --> 01:27:34.547
"Cloudless. " Could simply mean the sun.

01:27:35.218 --> 01:27:38.210
You need a sunny day... and rain.

01:27:39.589 --> 01:27:40.578
We need water.

01:27:41.324 --> 01:27:42.484
Water.

01:27:53.136 --> 01:27:54.262
Abigail.

01:27:55.438 --> 01:27:58.874
Everybody, the water makes
the rocks darker. Use the water.

01:27:58.942 --> 01:28:00.170
Em? Water?

01:28:00.243 --> 01:28:04.339
- What's this in my hand? Are you blind?
- Good, good, good.

01:28:16.392 --> 01:28:19.623
This is ridiculous.
Are we going to water the whole thing?

01:28:29.272 --> 01:28:30.739
That's it.

01:28:30.807 --> 01:28:35.403
Oh! That's it. I found it.
Over here! Found it! Over here!

01:28:37.614 --> 01:28:38.740
Look at this!

01:28:40.283 --> 01:28:41.341
It's an eagle.

01:28:43.319 --> 01:28:45.947
- Look at that. It's an eagle.
- There it is.

01:28:46.389 --> 01:28:49.187
- "The noble bird... "
- "Will give you passage. "

01:28:49.259 --> 01:28:52.751
- Uh-huh. Now what?
- We need to join hands,

01:28:52.862 --> 01:28:57.731
and in a noble manner,
pass over the bird.

01:28:58.868 --> 01:29:02.395
- It indicates direction...
- Somehow that bird...

01:29:02.472 --> 01:29:06.306
...will rise from the rock
and kind of caw...

01:29:06.376 --> 01:29:10.608
You can stand around guessing for a
while, or I can give you the next clue.

01:29:11.881 --> 01:29:14.782
"Surrender your hand
to the heart of the warrior. "

01:29:16.319 --> 01:29:18.651
And the eagle
is a symbol of the warrior.

01:29:24.060 --> 01:29:26.255
Ben, no. Wait, wait! No.

01:29:26.329 --> 01:29:29.025
That's probably a horrible trap.
Tell him!

01:29:29.098 --> 01:29:30.656
It's a horrible trap.

01:29:30.733 --> 01:29:34.362
It would be a pity to come this far
and not even try, now, wouldn't it?

01:29:35.705 --> 01:29:37.070
I'll do it, Ben.

01:29:37.707 --> 01:29:38.696
It's OK.

01:29:43.246 --> 01:29:45.111
Surrender your hand.

01:30:02.131 --> 01:30:05.225
- I am sorry. I... I couldn't resist.
- You!

01:30:07.470 --> 01:30:10.928
Lt, uh... feels like a latch.

01:30:20.283 --> 01:30:21.477
Look at this.

01:30:33.429 --> 01:30:36.159
All right, good. Let's go.

01:30:56.552 --> 01:30:58.144
Oh!

01:31:02.492 --> 01:31:03.959
Ben, look at this.

01:31:04.861 --> 01:31:07.022
Oh, that's beautiful!

01:31:10.800 --> 01:31:13.860
- Patrick. Patrick!
- Ben, what is that?

01:31:13.936 --> 01:31:16.928
Appears to be a counterweight
to hold the door open.

01:31:17.006 --> 01:31:19.099
What is that sound?

01:31:19.175 --> 01:31:20.506
Fascinating.

01:31:24.147 --> 01:31:26.342
Ah!

01:31:26.416 --> 01:31:27.474
Ben!

01:31:37.927 --> 01:31:39.224
Sorry.

01:31:39.295 --> 01:31:40.887
- You OK?
- No.

01:31:41.364 --> 01:31:42.353
Get up.

01:31:44.200 --> 01:31:45.189
It's locked.

01:31:45.268 --> 01:31:50.035
- Patrick, what have you done?
- Some kind of a bolt. I didn't do it.

01:31:50.106 --> 01:31:52.074
Only one way out of here now.

01:31:54.143 --> 01:31:55.371
Forward.

01:32:00.083 --> 01:32:03.052
Oh!

01:32:07.924 --> 01:32:10.358
Never seen so many relics.

01:32:10.426 --> 01:32:12.519
So beautifully preserved.

01:32:15.865 --> 01:32:18.527
Looks like we're going
to be moving some rocks.

01:32:18.601 --> 01:32:22.037
- There's a tunnel back in through here.
- Guys, look at this.

01:32:25.074 --> 01:32:26.598
It's a little golden man.

01:32:29.212 --> 01:32:34.047
Look. It's got a tiny little torso.
Look at that. It looks like...

01:32:47.196 --> 01:32:48.993
- Ben!
- Ben!

01:32:54.737 --> 01:32:58.002
Move back! Move back!
All of you! Other side!

01:33:00.943 --> 01:33:02.069
Back up! Back up!

01:33:02.912 --> 01:33:04.072
Ah!

01:33:08.451 --> 01:33:10.419
Riley, move forward! Move forward!

01:33:11.554 --> 01:33:13.021
No, back up, back up.

01:33:15.191 --> 01:33:17.250
- What you want me to do?
- Stop! Stop!

01:33:20.963 --> 01:33:24.660
We have to balance our weight
to even this thing out.

01:33:27.837 --> 01:33:29.896
- We'll find 'em.
- What are we gonna do?

01:33:29.972 --> 01:33:32.702
Figure something out.
Tell you what we're going to do.

01:33:32.775 --> 01:33:35.141
- No, I'll tell you.
- No. I'll tell you!

01:33:35.211 --> 01:33:38.044
No, I'll tell you!
There's that passageway.

01:33:38.114 --> 01:33:42.380
You go, pull those stones out,
because that leads somewhere.

01:33:42.451 --> 01:33:44.578
That is a good idea.

01:33:48.124 --> 01:33:51.252
There's nothing.
Just a big old black hole.

01:33:55.164 --> 01:33:57.632
Ben, look!
There's a ladder.

01:33:57.700 --> 01:34:01.761
- I mean, what's left of a ladder.
- Toss me the light.

01:34:04.273 --> 01:34:08.175
Riley. Move slowly to that corner.
No! Wait. Just...

01:34:08.244 --> 01:34:11.372
- As I move to this corner.
- OK.

01:34:13.549 --> 01:34:15.016
One step at a time. Good.

01:34:19.388 --> 01:34:22.516
If we can raise this corner,
I think I'll reach it.

01:34:26.095 --> 01:34:28.325
- Stop! Red light!
- You're not helping!

01:34:28.397 --> 01:34:30.456
I can get up there just as easy as you.

01:34:32.702 --> 01:34:33.691
Just stop.

01:34:35.171 --> 01:34:37.332
- Guys!
- It's three against one here.

01:34:37.406 --> 01:34:41.069
I ain't going last, and if I'm not
going last, I might as well go first.

01:34:42.445 --> 01:34:43.434
Look!

01:34:46.315 --> 01:34:47.907
What's it gonna be?

01:34:57.360 --> 01:34:59.123
We'll do this your way.

01:35:13.175 --> 01:35:17.043
The rest of us, on my count of three,
all move together.

01:35:17.113 --> 01:35:18.603
One step at a time.

01:35:19.448 --> 01:35:22.474
One, two, three.

01:35:41.804 --> 01:35:43.431
- You ready?
- Go.

01:35:55.051 --> 01:35:56.040
Ah!

01:36:17.306 --> 01:36:19.297
Mitch, what do you see?

01:36:20.609 --> 01:36:22.167
Is there a way out?

01:36:23.779 --> 01:36:25.303
What's up there, Mitch?

01:36:37.159 --> 01:36:38.319
Em?

01:36:38.394 --> 01:36:43.832
- Are you all right?
- Just promise me he's gonna be OK.

01:36:48.471 --> 01:36:49.563
All right.

01:36:51.374 --> 01:36:52.500
Let's go.

01:36:53.509 --> 01:36:55.977
Mitch! Come on!

01:36:56.746 --> 01:36:59.442
- I've been doing the math here, and...
- I know.

01:36:59.882 --> 01:37:02.316
We're gonna have to leave
one person behind.

01:37:02.385 --> 01:37:04.512
Promise you'll
come back for me.

01:37:04.587 --> 01:37:06.316
I can do the math too.

01:37:07.723 --> 01:37:10.385
- That makes you next.
- I'll go last.

01:37:12.094 --> 01:37:16.588
"No, we'll figure something else out. "
"We need you there. Please, Riley. "

01:37:18.334 --> 01:37:19.494
I'm just kidding. Go.

01:37:20.002 --> 01:37:21.560
OK...

01:37:50.499 --> 01:37:55.163
- One... two... three!
- Go!

01:38:00.309 --> 01:38:01.674
Oh!

01:38:02.311 --> 01:38:04.404
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

01:38:04.480 --> 01:38:06.038
Uh!

01:38:09.985 --> 01:38:11.009
I can't get it.

01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:20.051
Just go! Go now! Go!

01:38:22.565 --> 01:38:24.430
- All right, ready?
- Now!

01:38:24.500 --> 01:38:26.695
Ah!

01:38:26.769 --> 01:38:28.532
Riley! Hang on!

01:38:31.540 --> 01:38:36.068
OK. Mitch, the idol.
OK, Ben. We found a gold idol here!

01:38:36.145 --> 01:38:38.841
We can roll it over
to offset your weight!

01:38:38.914 --> 01:38:40.279
Then roll it!

01:38:43.586 --> 01:38:44.575
Here it comes!

01:38:53.429 --> 01:38:54.828
Come on, Ben!

01:38:57.700 --> 01:38:59.429
Here! Give me your hand!

01:39:01.837 --> 01:39:03.327
Ben!

01:39:04.540 --> 01:39:05.598
Thanks, Riley.

01:39:08.878 --> 01:39:10.743
Why couldn't a girl see me do that?

01:39:14.750 --> 01:39:18.550
- You all right?
- You're OK. You're OK. You're OK.

01:39:20.856 --> 01:39:23.051
So... forward.

01:39:26.595 --> 01:39:29.758
What is this?

01:39:29.832 --> 01:39:32.630
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:39:34.203 --> 01:39:35.431
Oh!

01:39:40.176 --> 01:39:42.007
Put your light over there.

01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.447
What are you doing?

01:40:12.508 --> 01:40:14.976
I can't see anything!
Is this it?

01:40:20.482 --> 01:40:21.471
It's oil!

01:41:00.589 --> 01:41:03.990
It's a dead end!
There's no way out!

01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:06.127
We have to turn back!

01:41:15.738 --> 01:41:17.069
OK.

01:41:19.675 --> 01:41:22.667
No. No, Patrick, this is crazy.

01:41:25.547 --> 01:41:26.536
OK.

01:41:31.687 --> 01:41:32.915
I got it!

01:41:35.124 --> 01:41:37.684
I got you! I got you!

01:42:06.588 --> 01:42:08.146
There's no forward!

01:42:11.160 --> 01:42:13.355
It's not forward, it's down!

01:42:14.330 --> 01:42:18.858
All this water has to go out somewhere.
Otherwise, it'd be filled up.

01:42:29.244 --> 01:42:31.235
Help me turn this wheel!

01:43:04.513 --> 01:43:06.378
The water's going down.

01:43:56.498 --> 01:43:58.193
It is... Em.

01:43:59.301 --> 01:44:01.292
Em. Em.

01:44:07.509 --> 01:44:09.340
Ben! Hey!

01:44:09.411 --> 01:44:13.711
Dad! We found it!

01:44:14.082 --> 01:44:17.643
- Thomas was right!
- No, you were right!

01:44:23.025 --> 01:44:26.290
Sorry I smeared your
great-great granddaddy's good name.

01:44:26.361 --> 01:44:28.921
Seemed like the only way
to get you in on the hunt.

01:44:28.997 --> 01:44:33.764
But this was a chance for the Wilkinson
family to make its mark on history,

01:44:33.836 --> 01:44:37.772
to find the City of Gold,
to be remembered.

01:45:08.570 --> 01:45:11.903
What happened to you?
Your father was worried sick about you.

01:45:11.974 --> 01:45:14.340
She was frantic. She was frantic.

01:45:15.344 --> 01:45:18.745
Dad, coming through,
did you happen to see?

01:45:18.814 --> 01:45:22.750
Stop it. Coming through, did you see
any branches that could lead out?

01:45:22.818 --> 01:45:26.811
No, it's all blocked. You can't even
get back to the big, round stone door.

01:45:27.322 --> 01:45:28.846
Where's your mother going?

01:45:31.593 --> 01:45:34.790
Sweetheart. Sweetheart.
Have a look at this.

01:45:34.863 --> 01:45:35.955
- What?
- Look.

01:45:36.031 --> 01:45:38.431
This is gonna unlock
the Olmec language.

01:45:38.500 --> 01:45:42.129
It's gonna give us incredible
insight into pre-Columbian history.

01:45:42.204 --> 01:45:44.035
Oh!

01:45:44.106 --> 01:45:45.869
Em?

01:45:45.941 --> 01:45:48.535
- You happy?
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:49.511 --> 01:45:52.503
- Ben! Look at this! Look!
- Oh, yeah.

01:45:53.048 --> 01:45:55.881
That's where they slit the throat,
cut the heart out.

01:46:13.302 --> 01:46:16.294
- What was that?
- Listen.

01:46:36.325 --> 01:46:38.088
Ah!

01:46:42.431 --> 01:46:46.094
I tried to find a way out.
All those portals are blocked off!

01:46:46.168 --> 01:46:49.626
I'm telling you, all this water
goes out somewhere. We'll find it.

01:46:57.145 --> 01:46:59.045
Ben, there's a current!

01:46:59.481 --> 01:47:02.541
Follow it!
There's got to be a central drain!

01:47:02.618 --> 01:47:04.711
It's under us. Right here!

01:47:13.962 --> 01:47:14.951
Come on!

01:47:16.398 --> 01:47:18.389
Let's go! Get in there!

01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:27.533
The water's rising too fast!

01:47:27.609 --> 01:47:30.339
Let's get that door open
so we don't all drown!

01:47:47.062 --> 01:47:50.225
Ben, it slopes down!
It's a drainage tunnel.

01:47:50.799 --> 01:47:53.063
It fills with water
when you open the door!

01:47:53.168 --> 01:47:56.296
We need to find something
to stick under it to keep it open!

01:47:56.338 --> 01:47:59.364
No, if it's open,
this tunnel will stay flooded.

01:47:59.441 --> 01:48:02.137
We've got to get to the other side
and close the door.

01:48:02.210 --> 01:48:03.939
Patrick, Emily, go!

01:48:09.317 --> 01:48:10.375
- No.
- No!

01:48:11.953 --> 01:48:12.942
No!

01:48:13.021 --> 01:48:15.785
Mitch, we got to be
on the other side of that door!

01:48:16.324 --> 01:48:18.121
Nobody leaves unless I say so.

01:48:19.594 --> 01:48:22.188
That door is not gonna stay open
by itself.

01:48:22.264 --> 01:48:24.494
We both know what has to happen here.

01:48:25.000 --> 01:48:28.401
One of us keeps the door open
and stays behind.

01:48:30.372 --> 01:48:31.464
I vote Mitch.

01:48:32.541 --> 01:48:34.475
This isn't a democracy.

01:48:39.114 --> 01:48:43.073
Stop! I'll stay!
I'm staying. Look. Look!

01:48:44.019 --> 01:48:46.510
See? I'm right here! I'm staying!

01:48:46.588 --> 01:48:49.318
I'll tell everybody
how this is going to go.

01:48:49.391 --> 01:48:53.657
You and me are going to open that door.
Anybody tries to leave before me,

01:48:53.762 --> 01:48:56.162
I drop the door,
we start this all over again!

01:48:56.198 --> 01:49:00.100
Try any funny business, I guarantee you
people are going to get hurt!

01:49:02.003 --> 01:49:05.495
I won't! You have my word.
Just let her go.

01:49:09.544 --> 01:49:12.172
Ben, no, we're not leaving without you.

01:49:14.149 --> 01:49:15.138
Abigail.

01:49:19.254 --> 01:49:22.985
You make my parents leave.
You make my parents leave.

01:49:32.334 --> 01:49:33.596
- No!
- Let's go!

01:49:34.102 --> 01:49:38.061
Let's go, please! Patrick, Emily,
he's trying to save our lives.

01:49:38.807 --> 01:49:40.434
Please, come on.

01:49:42.410 --> 01:49:43.604
Push, Ben!

01:49:47.282 --> 01:49:49.216
The current's too strong!

01:49:52.454 --> 01:49:54.649
- I'm ready!
- It's all yours!

01:50:10.639 --> 01:50:11.628
Ah!

01:50:17.712 --> 01:50:18.872
Mom!

01:50:19.447 --> 01:50:21.677
Hang on!

01:50:24.519 --> 01:50:25.781
Hold your breath!

01:50:35.564 --> 01:50:37.395
Ah!

01:50:37.465 --> 01:50:39.194
We got to get Ben out of there!

01:50:42.237 --> 01:50:46.537
If I'm stuck in the door,
it stays open,

01:50:46.608 --> 01:50:49.543
both rooms fill up, and we all drown!

01:50:49.611 --> 01:50:53.741
- Open the door! I'll get you out!
- The current's too strong!

01:50:53.849 --> 01:50:56.374
I open the door,
you'll be washed down!

01:50:56.418 --> 01:50:57.783
I'll get you out!

01:50:57.853 --> 01:51:02.222
I found the City of Gold! I found it!

01:51:02.290 --> 01:51:04.281
And no one will ever know?

01:51:04.359 --> 01:51:08.591
We can figure this out!
We can all get out!

01:51:08.663 --> 01:51:12.224
It's not a puzzle!
No more puzzles, Ben!

01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.463
We're all going to die,
or it could just be me!

01:51:16.304 --> 01:51:19.762
- Tell them I found it!
- Don't quit!

01:51:21.276 --> 01:51:23.403
Mitch!

01:51:32.554 --> 01:51:33.612
Ah!

01:52:03.885 --> 01:52:05.011
Thank you.

01:52:22.537 --> 01:52:26.496
- We haven't officially met. I'm Riley.
- Oh, hi.

01:52:32.747 --> 01:52:35.307
Sir! It's for you.

01:52:36.618 --> 01:52:37.607
Sadusky.

01:52:38.553 --> 01:52:41.351
- I have my proof.
- Ben!

01:52:41.756 --> 01:52:45.624
We were just talking about you.
Ready to turn yourself in?

01:52:45.694 --> 01:52:49.357
Not quite.
We found the City of Gold.

01:52:49.431 --> 01:52:52.229
Doesn't matter.
You still committed a federal crime.

01:53:12.721 --> 01:53:15.315
Stop. Stop it.

01:53:16.424 --> 01:53:18.756
- Mr. President?
- Craig, give us a minute.

01:53:18.827 --> 01:53:22.593
Sir, for your information,
this is the man who kidnapped you.

01:53:22.664 --> 01:53:25.428
As I recall, we were
exploring a hidden tunnel,

01:53:25.500 --> 01:53:29.061
and a door closed accidentally,
and this man saved my life.

01:53:29.404 --> 01:53:30.598
Yes, sir.

01:53:32.807 --> 01:53:34.570
- Gates.
- Sir.

01:53:35.643 --> 01:53:40.205
For the record, after centuries
of exploration, on this day,

01:53:40.281 --> 01:53:43.808
you have brought honor
to your country and your family.

01:53:45.353 --> 01:53:48.288
You've done this country
a great service. I thank you.

01:53:48.823 --> 01:53:51.485
- Thank you.
- Craig.

01:53:52.827 --> 01:53:57.093
I thought you might want to
take a look at tomorrow's headlines.

01:53:58.666 --> 01:53:59.655
Tomorrow?

01:54:07.876 --> 01:54:09.138
Thank you, sir.

01:54:10.111 --> 01:54:12.579
All of you, along with
Emily and Patrick Gates

01:54:12.647 --> 01:54:14.740
will get credit for this discovery.

01:54:21.890 --> 01:54:24.256
And Mitch Wilkinson, sir.

01:54:25.160 --> 01:54:28.994
- Is that right?
- It's true, sir.

01:54:30.598 --> 01:54:33.590
Ben, I am curious
about that favor I asked you.

01:54:35.136 --> 01:54:37.570
Any report regarding
what's on page 47?

01:54:37.639 --> 01:54:39.834
I believe I can help with that, sir.

01:54:39.908 --> 01:54:43.105
- So it's good.
- Life-altering, sir.

01:54:46.781 --> 01:54:50.410
What's on page 47?
Are you talking about the Book?

01:54:53.655 --> 01:54:54.781
What book?

01:54:56.357 --> 01:55:00.418
Be very careful with that.
Is that distilled water you're using?

01:55:00.495 --> 01:55:02.759
- Yes.
- Have you catalogued all of this?

01:55:02.831 --> 01:55:04.196
- No, ma'am.
- You haven't?

01:55:04.265 --> 01:55:07.325
Excuse me? Excuse me, sir?
Are you cataloguing this?

01:55:07.402 --> 01:55:10.701
You should've been there
when we picked out our first couch.

01:55:14.676 --> 01:55:16.109
Excuse me.

01:55:16.177 --> 01:55:20.079
Hey, you're that guy...
The treasure hunter guy, right?

01:55:20.148 --> 01:55:23.982
No, actually, the guy you're thinking of
is somewhere over there.

01:55:24.052 --> 01:55:28.489
No. You're him. Riley Poole.
I recognize you from your book.

01:55:29.157 --> 01:55:31.148
Will you sign it?

01:55:31.226 --> 01:55:32.215
OK.

01:55:41.469 --> 01:55:42.458
Thank you.

01:55:43.805 --> 01:55:47.036
So, um, the tea tables...

01:55:48.042 --> 01:55:51.773
Yes, I'm going to have the movers
bring them to you next week.

01:55:52.747 --> 01:55:54.681
I was going to say
you can keep them.

01:55:55.550 --> 01:55:59.680
And maybe you could...

01:55:59.754 --> 01:56:02.052
...come and move back in with me.

01:56:03.224 --> 01:56:06.022
- No. You used the word "so. "
- So?

01:56:06.094 --> 01:56:08.528
So, when you say "so,"
it means you're angry.

01:56:08.596 --> 01:56:12.555
Sometimes.
And then sometimes it doesn't.

01:56:12.634 --> 01:56:14.966
It's sort of like a puzzle.

01:56:16.504 --> 01:56:20.167
And you're so good at puzzles.
I'm sure you'll figure it out.

01:56:22.710 --> 01:56:23.904
So...

01:57:10.692 --> 01:57:12.319
I love this car.

01:57:13.305 --> 01:57:19.298
