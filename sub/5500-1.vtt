00:05.598 --> 00:09.201
<i>Charlotte... there are things
you couldn't have known.</i>

00:09.301 --> 00:13.238
<i>It would be difficult for you to grasp
the depths to which I had fallen,</i>

00:13.338 --> 00:16.405
<i>or the guilt that plagued me,
without grasping the scale of this monster</i>

00:16.505 --> 00:19.081
<i>called the East India Company.</i>

00:19.678 --> 00:22.741
<i>In their greed and avarice,
they had flung their empire of destruction</i>

00:22.841 --> 00:24.832
<i>around the globe.</i>

00:25.184 --> 00:27.219
<i>In time, there was investigation,</i>

00:27.319 --> 00:30.389
<i>and finally, there was this report.</i>

00:30.489 --> 00:33.325
<i>It had a lot to say about Charles Kemp</i>

00:33.425 --> 00:37.296
<i>and, I'm afraid,
made mention of me as well.</i>

00:37.396 --> 00:41.700
<i>Delivering this report to you the moment
you are ready to receive me again</i>

00:41.800 --> 00:44.620
<i>will be my last job.</i>

00:44.720 --> 00:49.611
<i>I live only to be worthy
of your respect.</i>

00:53.145 --> 00:55.734
Steady as she goes!

01:09.995 --> 01:12.534
- Hold the course.
- Yes, sir.

01:23.508 --> 01:25.768
Call the shot, Mr. Brand.

01:26.712 --> 01:29.368
One last time.

01:31.416 --> 01:34.320
Speed, three knots.

01:34.820 --> 01:37.177
On my mark. Fire.

01:38.924 --> 01:41.427
- <i>Gentlemen of the board.</i>
- Fire.

01:41.527 --> 01:43.296
<i>It's good to be back in London.</i>

01:43.396 --> 01:49.034
I am pleased to report that our operations
in India continue to be profitable.

01:49.134 --> 01:54.706
And yet, I have a feeling that our
interests in the American colonies

01:54.806 --> 01:59.579
could match or even exceed
our revenues from India.

02:00.479 --> 02:02.414
<i>Provided, of course...</i>

02:02.514 --> 02:07.472
<i>that we can keep Parliament
from meddling in our affairs.</i>

02:17.162 --> 02:19.031
<i>Even as we meet,</i>

02:19.131 --> 02:23.335
<i>my team is intercepting the final report
of Parliament's investigation</i>

02:23.435 --> 02:26.205
<i>of our business practices in India.</i>

02:26.305 --> 02:30.679
<i>My men are replacing
the official report with an altered copy</i>

02:30.779 --> 02:35.447
<i>which, I can assure you, will read
quite differently from the original.</i>

02:35.547 --> 02:36.749
- Oh! He's dead!
- Hey!

02:36.849 --> 02:39.871
- Sound the alarm!
- Time to go!

02:52.564 --> 02:58.103
<i>Gentlemen, I assure you,
you may trust in my discretion.</i>

02:58.203 --> 03:02.627
<i>Nothing, and no one
will stand in our way.</i>

03:46.652 --> 03:48.420
William.

03:48.820 --> 03:52.925
In the 14 years that I have known you,
you have never let me down.

03:53.025 --> 03:55.268
Not once.

03:55.861 --> 03:58.416
You are a treasure to me.

03:59.030 --> 04:02.088
- Thank you, sir.
- What is this?

04:06.371 --> 04:09.395
Oh, yes, very fine!

04:12.811 --> 04:15.047
Very much like my own.

04:15.147 --> 04:16.781
Yes.

04:17.182 --> 04:19.017
So, then, you are what?

04:19.117 --> 04:24.089
One week back in England, and already
carrying yourself like a gentleman.

04:24.189 --> 04:28.176
Well, in as much as I'll have the title
and lands that you've promised me,

04:28.276 --> 04:30.062
I thought I should make a start.

04:30.162 --> 04:32.731
I hope I'm not too eager in following
in your footsteps.

04:32.831 --> 04:37.188
Oh, my dear boy, have I... Have I not
impressed upon you the opportunities

04:37.288 --> 04:39.294
that could await you in the Americas?

04:39.394 --> 04:41.840
And think of it, that vast hinterland

04:41.940 --> 04:44.743
and those 13 squabbling colonies,

04:44.843 --> 04:46.912
all ripe for the picking.

04:47.312 --> 04:50.516
- Have I not done all that you've asked?
- You have.

04:50.616 --> 04:52.818
- All that was required.
- All.

04:52.918 --> 04:54.620
I've made my fortune...

04:54.720 --> 04:58.390
And you have made your fortune
doing exactly what I asked you to do.

04:58.490 --> 05:02.160
And you are the man
that I need there in the Americas.

05:03.300 --> 05:05.367
I'm done.

05:06.031 --> 05:07.786
I'm ready to put this
behind me, as you did.

05:07.886 --> 05:10.469
I will triple the offer
I have made to you.

05:10.589 --> 05:13.839
Already the Company
owes me over Â£10,000.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.228
And I have your promise of a new name.

05:16.328 --> 05:18.816
My heart is set on other things.

05:19.931 --> 05:21.823
You mean that?

05:21.923 --> 05:23.522
Yes.

05:29.574 --> 05:34.299
It's set. 10-second timer
once you pull the cord.

05:38.450 --> 05:41.319
You heard what he said.
10 seconds. Don't waste it.

05:41.419 --> 05:45.344
And make sure he's dead
before you jump. Go.

05:52.931 --> 05:56.488
Good luck, Will. Safe travels.

06:10.148 --> 06:13.655
Driver! Hey! Wait!

06:13.755 --> 06:15.567
Stop your carriage!

06:17.155 --> 06:19.711
Driver! Hey!

06:20.492 --> 06:24.583
Wait! Your carriage is on fire!

06:30.702 --> 06:34.225
<i>In that moment, I knew my guilt
had come to pay me out.</i>

06:43.215 --> 06:45.472
Give me your hand! Jump!

06:45.572 --> 06:47.305
- Get back!
- Now!

07:00.565 --> 07:05.070
On him... will fall the full burden

07:05.170 --> 07:06.905
<i>of the accusations.</i>

07:07.005 --> 07:11.327
<i>All of the vilifications that will
have been aimed at the company.</i>

07:12.077 --> 07:16.314
Tomorrow, in your newspapers,
gentlemen, you will be shocked

07:16.614 --> 07:19.351
<i>to learn of the rogue activities</i>

07:19.451 --> 07:23.021
<i>of that infamous scoundrel,</i>

07:23.121 --> 07:26.278
<i>the late William Reynolds.</i>

08:00.325 --> 08:01.680
Sorry about that.

08:12.671 --> 08:15.060
You would be a vicar.

08:17.242 --> 08:19.477
<i>I had wanted a new name.</i>

08:19.577 --> 08:21.633
<i>Now, I had it.</i>

08:21.980 --> 08:23.709
<i>This wasn't my idea, but...</i>

08:24.109 --> 08:26.751
<i>there was a sense of divine justice,</i>

08:26.851 --> 08:29.788
<i>that an assassin like me
should be forced to live</i>

08:29.888 --> 08:32.143
<i>a vicar's life.</i>

08:32.756 --> 08:34.960
By my word.

08:35.059 --> 08:37.616
I will avenge us both for this.

09:26.343 --> 09:28.178
Sir?

09:32.016 --> 09:33.672
Oh, Lord.

09:39.207 --> 09:41.630
Brent! Wake Jeremiah!

09:46.698 --> 09:49.240
Sir. Sir.

09:49.340 --> 09:54.159
I do hope he hasn't contracted
any of those lake diseases.

09:54.259 --> 09:58.730
- Indeed, Mrs. Witherspoon.
- I understand they're quite dreadful.

09:58.830 --> 10:02.687
- Will he recover, Doctor?
- I think so, Mrs. Holloway.

10:04.169 --> 10:08.540
Oh, I hope it's not going
to hinder his preaching.

10:08.640 --> 10:11.996
Anything would be better though
than the last vicar.

10:12.410 --> 10:17.982
He faithfully preached
the worst sermons I have ever heard.

10:18.082 --> 10:22.407
- Give him rest and quiet.
- Thank you.

11:10.468 --> 11:12.303
Reverend?

11:12.403 --> 11:14.904
It's good to see you awake.

11:15.540 --> 11:18.243
The newspapers are full of your story.

11:18.343 --> 11:21.877
Apparently, you were the last victim of
a rogue who did terrible things in India.

11:22.347 --> 11:24.649
His name was William Reynolds.

11:24.749 --> 11:29.073
Seemed to be a very brutal man.
A miracle that you survived.

11:42.717 --> 11:46.708
<i>Becoming a vicar hadn't turned out
so bad after all.</i>

11:47.438 --> 11:50.094
<i>You had believed my story, and...</i>

11:50.442 --> 11:53.231
<i>now Reynolds was dead.</i>

11:56.080 --> 11:58.796
<i>There was an untouched innocence
and a beauty about the place</i>

11:58.896 --> 12:01.139
<i>that was very attractive.</i>

12:03.621 --> 12:07.292
- The kitchen's well stocked...
- <i>I reasoned that my revenge could wait...</i>

12:07.392 --> 12:10.474
<i>while I explored
where this path might lead.</i>

12:18.236 --> 12:20.291
That tattoo.

12:21.306 --> 12:23.408
East India Company?

12:23.508 --> 12:25.677
I've seen it before.

12:25.777 --> 12:27.699
On slave traders, mainly.

12:30.048 --> 12:32.403
Mrs. Holloway knows.

12:33.284 --> 12:37.409
A friend contacted a family for me
after Mr. Holloway died.

12:38.663 --> 12:40.445
I needed out.

12:41.092 --> 12:43.281
And they needed me.

12:44.329 --> 12:47.165
The whole town is talking
about your arrival.

12:47.265 --> 12:52.170
We should hurry on over to the church
or we'll be late for your first sermon.

12:52.270 --> 12:53.665
My sermon?

12:54.973 --> 12:57.495
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

12:57.942 --> 13:00.498
- Good morning.
- Today's homily is...

13:05.984 --> 13:10.108
Near, and... dear,

13:10.722 --> 13:14.245
to, I am sure, many of you.

13:24.669 --> 13:26.891
Let's all stand.

13:39.751 --> 13:42.273
Thank you. You may be seated.

13:48.459 --> 13:50.695
I apologize. I...

13:51.195 --> 13:52.918
can't read my own writing sometimes.

14:10.548 --> 14:13.205
Burn it! Burn it all!

14:45.950 --> 14:47.952
Come on, Will.

14:48.052 --> 14:49.508
Pull yourself together.

14:51.022 --> 14:52.944
Reverend.

14:54.258 --> 14:56.080
Are you well?

14:58.562 --> 15:01.132
Yes. Why are you here?

15:01.632 --> 15:05.603
My mother asked me
to make sure you come to supper.

15:05.703 --> 15:08.006
She had her doubts you would.

15:08.106 --> 15:10.174
Will you join us?

15:10.274 --> 15:13.341
Yes. Yes, of course I will.

15:20.585 --> 15:24.261
<i>And so, the days stretched into weeks.</i>

15:24.989 --> 15:27.358
<i>When I was with you, Charlotte,</i>

15:27.458 --> 15:30.635
<i>the darkness seemed further away.</i>

15:55.820 --> 15:58.971
We're all very fond of you,
as I hope you know.

15:59.523 --> 16:00.858
"We"?

16:00.958 --> 16:03.963
Oh, yes, my mother is happy
that you're here.

16:05.463 --> 16:07.471
Yes, I see.

16:09.233 --> 16:11.308
And you?

16:12.536 --> 16:15.607
Who else would be my walking companion?

16:15.707 --> 16:19.210
So, you saved me from drowning
to be your walking companion?

16:19.310 --> 16:21.479
Why else?

16:21.579 --> 16:23.564
Because you're kind.

16:23.664 --> 16:28.954
- You're compassionate, you're virtuous...
- Stop. Please, I do not deserve such talk.

16:29.654 --> 16:33.364
Charlotte, I feel as if I...
I have a new life here.

16:33.625 --> 16:35.617
It's a life you made possible.

16:37.395 --> 16:39.804
Only God can give us new lives.

16:41.332 --> 16:44.141
God did not drag me from this pond.

16:46.237 --> 16:48.688
How can we know the ways of God?

16:50.141 --> 16:52.810
Five minutes sooner
or five minutes later,

16:52.910 --> 16:55.387
everything might have been different.

16:56.547 --> 16:58.356
That is the mystery of it.

16:59.483 --> 17:02.259
What do you feel, Mr. Walters?

17:04.922 --> 17:08.232
I feel as if I can trust you
with my life.

17:10.595 --> 17:12.404
I've never felt such a thing before.

17:14.565 --> 17:17.468
If that is providence, or fate,

17:17.568 --> 17:21.571
whatever you would call it, then...
then I will accept it.

17:21.672 --> 17:23.381
"If"?

17:26.444 --> 17:30.541
What am I to think of a vicar who seems
so unsure of what he believes?

17:30.641 --> 17:33.584
Charlotte, I'm...
I'm speaking to you truthfully.

17:33.684 --> 17:35.760
From my heart.

17:37.722 --> 17:40.535
Oh, this is terribly confusing.

17:45.563 --> 17:49.834
Steven, I have an uncle
who is coming at Christmas.

17:50.434 --> 17:54.181
He's traveling to America
and he's invited me to go with him.

17:54.281 --> 17:56.323
And you've agreed?

17:56.423 --> 17:58.627
Well, I'm hard pressed to say no.

17:59.577 --> 18:02.847
My mother believes it'll be
a great experience for me.

18:02.947 --> 18:05.722
But to leave Adlesbury...

18:06.384 --> 18:08.993
What reason do I have to stay?

18:12.123 --> 18:14.733
Would you like me to give you a reason?

18:16.427 --> 18:18.850
Only if it is a good one.

18:25.536 --> 18:28.346
Charlotte! Blast the devil's luck.

18:37.148 --> 18:39.750
I'm sorry, I didn't know
if you could swim!

18:40.204 --> 18:43.788
Thank you! I can't!

18:44.635 --> 18:46.917
You're soaking! Let me walk you home.

18:47.017 --> 18:50.225
Yes! I think that would be a good idea.

19:01.705 --> 19:03.762
Good evening, Reverend.

19:04.575 --> 19:07.318
Or is it... "parson"?

19:08.345 --> 19:10.721
I get them confused.

19:13.985 --> 19:16.560
Come to the fire where I can see you.

19:20.557 --> 19:22.933
So, he sent you for me.

19:25.029 --> 19:26.797
No.

19:26.897 --> 19:28.767
We thought you were dead.

19:29.367 --> 19:33.775
So imagine my surprise when I found you
back from the dead.

19:34.438 --> 19:37.482
See, you have put me
in an awkward position, Will.

19:38.909 --> 19:43.588
I do have my allegiance
with Charles Kemp to consider.

19:45.616 --> 19:47.758
So, what are you offering?

19:48.552 --> 19:50.955
I do have a few items that...

19:51.055 --> 19:53.391
could destroy him...

19:53.491 --> 19:55.793
- if in the right hands.
- I'm listening.

19:55.893 --> 19:59.168
I have the Parliamentary Report
from Rajid.

19:59.931 --> 20:02.466
Not the one Kemp doctored,
but the real one.

20:02.566 --> 20:06.037
With all the names, dates,
financial transactions, it's all there.

20:06.137 --> 20:10.881
So, you negotiate the deal with him,
and I'll split the amount with you.

20:12.910 --> 20:17.849
Well, this is remarkable. I assumed a man
of the cloth would use a report like that

20:17.949 --> 20:22.797
to expose the evil wrought by Mr. Kemp.

20:24.288 --> 20:27.825
But you aren't a man of the cloth,
are you, Will?

20:27.925 --> 20:29.694
I have found a new life.

20:30.194 --> 20:32.129
A vicar?

20:32.229 --> 20:34.477
Isn't that an absurd mask
for you to wear?

20:36.734 --> 20:38.422
What if it's not a mask?

20:41.605 --> 20:44.162
So, you have told her who you are.

20:45.342 --> 20:47.383
Why don't you?

20:47.912 --> 20:50.788
And see what the lady
thinks of you then.

20:53.317 --> 20:56.194
Your hands are stained with blood.

20:58.856 --> 21:01.065
I'm asking you...

21:02.693 --> 21:04.435
please...

21:05.696 --> 21:07.771
take the report...

21:08.099 --> 21:09.767
and leave.

21:09.867 --> 21:11.676
I will.

21:12.303 --> 21:14.371
Along with your carcass...

21:14.471 --> 21:16.808
and whatever reward he gives me.

21:17.508 --> 21:20.544
Hell's been waiting
a very long time for you,

21:20.644 --> 21:22.287
Will Reynolds.

21:57.965 --> 22:00.007
You think you're better than me?

22:37.922 --> 22:39.791
<i>Mother.</i>

22:40.691 --> 22:44.168
<i>How did you know
that Father was the right one?</i>

22:45.763 --> 22:48.138
Why do you ask?

22:53.637 --> 22:57.328
Is this about our vicar?

22:59.610 --> 23:02.681
You've grown very fond of him, I know.

23:05.950 --> 23:08.085
He is a gentleman.

23:08.185 --> 23:11.294
And... intelligent and...

23:11.789 --> 23:16.602
enjoyable in conversation.
So full of surprises.

23:19.663 --> 23:21.522
Do you love him?

23:21.832 --> 23:23.734
I could...

23:23.834 --> 23:25.643
I might.

23:26.971 --> 23:30.815
But there is something
that beguiles me about him.

23:32.376 --> 23:34.919
When I wish with all my heart
that we would move forward...

23:36.113 --> 23:37.988
<i>I stop.</i>

23:40.517 --> 23:42.920
<i>All of his good words...</i>

23:43.020 --> 23:45.129
<i>there's something missing.</i>

23:46.757 --> 23:50.327
<i>Because sometimes he speaks of God
as a distant acquaintance,</i>

23:50.427 --> 23:52.903
<i>not as an intimate friend.</i>

23:54.531 --> 23:56.734
It's times like these I...

23:56.834 --> 23:59.507
I do miss Father terribly.

24:08.612 --> 24:12.616
You could speak with your uncle
when he comes at Christmas.

24:12.716 --> 24:14.686
Can't you wait until then?

24:14.786 --> 24:17.021
There's no reason to rush.

24:17.121 --> 24:20.283
I simply cannot make a decision
about America without...

24:20.383 --> 24:22.794
resolving my feelings for Steven first.

24:23.494 --> 24:27.371
<i>But you aren't a man
of the cloth, are you, Will?</i>

24:28.198 --> 24:31.268
<i>You are the same man you've always been.</i>

24:31.568 --> 24:34.153
<i>Your hands are stained with...</i>

24:41.879 --> 24:45.376
Please. Please show me what I must do.

25:06.603 --> 25:10.147
- Charlotte.
- Is everything all right?

25:11.975 --> 25:13.578
No.

25:14.178 --> 25:16.080
It's not all right.

25:18.449 --> 25:20.925
There are things about me that...

25:25.289 --> 25:27.598
I'm not the man that...

25:28.692 --> 25:31.336
That is to say that in my past, I...

25:32.830 --> 25:35.505
Before I came to Adlesbury...

25:36.667 --> 25:38.398
I was not trained as a vicar.

25:40.504 --> 25:44.223
The quality of your training
has been a question.

25:45.843 --> 25:48.385
What I mean to say, though, is...

25:50.614 --> 25:53.056
I'm not worthy of you.

25:53.550 --> 25:56.093
I know of no man who is.

25:58.188 --> 26:02.232
Certainly, you deserve better
than anything that I can...

26:04.928 --> 26:07.338
I'm not a good man.

26:08.866 --> 26:11.208
But I decided to be.

26:12.336 --> 26:15.712
The thought of losing you,
it's more than I can bear.

26:16.640 --> 26:19.483
You embody God's mercy for me.

26:21.078 --> 26:24.803
It's a mercy that I'm beginning
to appreciate, though...

26:24.903 --> 26:26.728
I don't deserve it.

26:28.051 --> 26:30.598
I guess what I'm trying to say is...

26:30.898 --> 26:33.369
please don't go to America.

26:33.891 --> 26:36.733
I don't want to be separated from you.

26:39.229 --> 26:41.738
Ms. Charlotte Holloway, I...

26:48.972 --> 26:50.829
Will you consent to be my wife?

26:54.645 --> 26:57.939
- Mr. Walters...
- Please don't... Don't call me that.

26:58.039 --> 27:00.540
I'm sorry. Steven.

27:02.403 --> 27:04.478
I... I cannot.

27:06.255 --> 27:09.293
But... that is to say, I...

27:09.393 --> 27:12.603
I cannot give you an answer yet.

27:15.933 --> 27:18.435
Not because I do not wish to say yes,

27:18.535 --> 27:20.877
because I do.

27:21.271 --> 27:22.974
But I don't...

27:23.474 --> 27:25.977
fully trust myself...

27:26.777 --> 27:29.654
to make a decision
of this importance alone.

27:31.515 --> 27:34.992
Charlotte, I... I will do anything.

27:37.821 --> 27:39.864
Will you meet my uncle at Christmas?

27:41.792 --> 27:44.368
Yes. Yes, of course.

27:45.696 --> 27:47.838
I would like that.

27:54.137 --> 27:56.446
With his approval,

27:57.140 --> 27:59.716
I will be most happy to agree.

28:00.744 --> 28:03.954
Thank you. Thank you. I...

28:04.548 --> 28:06.390
I am honored.

28:07.484 --> 28:09.793
Thank you, Steven.

28:12.022 --> 28:14.525
Good night, Ms. Charlotte.

28:14.625 --> 28:16.500
Good night.

29:03.373 --> 29:06.360
Steven! Are you coming along?

29:06.460 --> 29:08.312
Yes, of course.

29:08.412 --> 29:10.680
My uncle can hardly wait to see you.

29:10.780 --> 29:13.450
Now? Before the service?

29:15.251 --> 29:18.879
- Would you rather we wait?
- No. No, now will do.

29:18.979 --> 29:21.776
Thank you! Uncle!

29:24.895 --> 29:27.798
Steven, this is my Uncle Charles.

29:28.098 --> 29:30.775
Uncle Charles, Steven Walters.

29:39.743 --> 29:42.446
Charlotte, my dear,
would you mind leaving us?

29:42.546 --> 29:45.789
We... we need to talk man-to-man.

29:46.183 --> 29:48.125
I'll wait.

30:09.406 --> 30:13.244
- You astonish me, Will.
- Then we are in good company.

30:14.144 --> 30:17.520
Oi! Form up! We're needed at the church.

30:27.925 --> 30:31.295
You are no man of peace! Or is this a...

30:31.395 --> 30:33.897
Not my niece!

30:33.997 --> 30:36.647
Good heavens, man, do you really think
that you can have a life...

30:36.747 --> 30:40.120
Charles, I beg of you.
If only for the sake of old loyalties,

30:40.220 --> 30:44.314
- my service to you in India, all I have...
- She's not your sort!

30:44.942 --> 30:47.918
She is a good person.

30:49.513 --> 30:54.525
Would she be surprised if I showed her the
uncorrected Parliamentary Report I possess?

30:58.788 --> 31:01.491
You threaten me, you dog?

31:01.591 --> 31:05.001
Steven, Uncle Charles, Mother's worried.

31:05.695 --> 31:08.071
What's the matter?

31:20.827 --> 31:24.255
Charlotte, my dear,
it grieves me that this scoundrel

31:24.355 --> 31:27.617
has lied his way into your affections.

31:27.717 --> 31:28.886
What?

31:28.986 --> 31:31.822
Our paths have crossed before in India!

31:31.922 --> 31:34.858
- Charlotte, I can explain.
- He is a liar...

31:34.958 --> 31:38.528
- And I have changed because of you.
- He is an impostor...

31:38.628 --> 31:41.759
- And he is a murderer.
- I'm sorry, I don't understand.

31:41.859 --> 31:44.568
I told you, Reverend Walters
had a past you didn't know of.

31:44.668 --> 31:48.656
But you are neither Reverend
nor are you Walters.

31:49.106 --> 31:52.409
You are the infamous scoundrel...

31:52.509 --> 31:55.546
- William Reynolds!
- Charlotte, please.

31:55.646 --> 31:57.447
- Guards!
- I can explain!

31:57.547 --> 31:59.917
- Come, my dear. Come. Guards, quickly!
- Open this door!

32:00.017 --> 32:01.348
- Come on!
- Steven!

32:01.448 --> 32:03.727
- This is not who I am!
- No! Wait!

32:30.314 --> 32:31.649
Hey! There he is!

32:31.749 --> 32:33.284
Move along!

32:33.784 --> 32:35.725
Get out of the way!

32:50.500 --> 32:52.042
Let's go! Yeah!

33:09.052 --> 33:11.294
Should we pursue?

33:11.588 --> 33:15.832
No need. I have something that he wants.

33:16.259 --> 33:18.635
He will come to me.

33:30.540 --> 33:32.301
How did you know I needed help?

33:36.079 --> 33:38.388
East India Company.

33:39.215 --> 33:41.809
When I stayed with their horses, I...

33:42.309 --> 33:44.761
I saw their weapons and I knew.

33:48.257 --> 33:50.700
I grabbed these for you.

33:56.232 --> 33:58.575
Escape while you can.

34:00.003 --> 34:02.974
You can't undo the damage done.

34:03.673 --> 34:05.315
No.

34:06.209 --> 34:08.351
I have to.

34:09.780 --> 34:12.054
He's taken everything from me.

34:17.320 --> 34:21.331
Ms. Charlotte will not be moved
by revenge.

34:26.697 --> 34:28.938
I'm so sorry...

34:30.266 --> 34:32.742
You shouldn't have saved me.

34:34.304 --> 34:36.905
My life wasn't worth your sacrifice.

34:40.377 --> 34:42.312
Redemption,

34:42.712 --> 34:44.888
not revenge.

34:48.318 --> 34:51.254
There's only one man with the power

34:51.353 --> 34:53.563
to make you new.

35:25.255 --> 35:26.897
God...

35:29.759 --> 35:32.536
if you'll help me redeem my name,

35:36.232 --> 35:38.708
I will lay aside revenge.

35:44.174 --> 35:47.050
Let me show Charlotte that I can change.

35:50.613 --> 35:52.356
Because of her.

35:55.385 --> 35:59.554
I'm so sorry, Charlotte,
but William is dead.

36:10.300 --> 36:13.743
- It's not here.
- Keep searching.

36:37.694 --> 36:42.168
<i>Charlotte, your uncle's evil
made me into William Reynolds.</i>

36:43.967 --> 36:48.114
<i>But now,</i> <i>he will be my opportunity.</i>

36:48.214 --> 36:51.448
<i>I will prove to you
that I am a different man.</i>

36:53.009 --> 36:58.182
<i>I will dismantle his plans
piece by piece.</i>

37:00.850 --> 37:04.187
<i>I will create a new reputation
honorable enough...</i>

37:04.287 --> 37:06.863
<i>to save me from my past.</i>

37:24.674 --> 37:27.143
- Can I help you, sir?
- Yes, please.

37:27.243 --> 37:30.847
I'm looking for... Benjamin Franklin.

37:30.947 --> 37:34.725
If you're looking for Mr. Franklin,
you'll find him at the shop.

37:56.840 --> 37:59.726
Occasional incompetence
may be overlooked,

37:59.976 --> 38:04.681
but yours persists at a level
worthy of Parliament.

38:04.781 --> 38:07.957
No, my good man, my decision is final.

38:08.118 --> 38:10.240
I must let you go.

38:10.340 --> 38:13.897
- Good day, sir.
- And good day to you, sir.

38:14.691 --> 38:16.760
And don't be a stranger...

38:16.860 --> 38:20.061
to other establishments in town.

38:23.783 --> 38:25.194
You're Mr. Franklin?

38:26.269 --> 38:29.806
Well, now that depends.
Do I owe you money?

38:29.906 --> 38:32.775
Have I offended a woman
of your acquaintance?

38:32.875 --> 38:34.444
No.

38:34.544 --> 38:37.047
Then, I am Benjamin Franklin.

38:37.147 --> 38:40.751
- How may I be of service?
- Sir, I seek employment.

38:41.051 --> 38:42.353
I'm retired.

38:43.353 --> 38:45.562
Are you skilled as a printer?

38:46.256 --> 38:48.180
I'm a fast learner.

38:48.280 --> 38:53.102
Another! All of our fast learners
have been fast leaving.

38:53.529 --> 38:56.199
Tell me, do you favor the King...

38:56.299 --> 39:00.003
or alternatives yet to be explored?

39:00.103 --> 39:04.207
On having only just arrived in this country,
I suppose I'm in favor of myself.

39:04.307 --> 39:06.242
What others do is not my business.

39:07.322 --> 39:09.079
Smart man!

39:09.179 --> 39:11.414
But with no conviction.

39:11.514 --> 39:16.493
Such a shame. But... anyone
can remake themselves here.

39:16.593 --> 39:19.094
Even young men with no conviction.

39:19.956 --> 39:21.072
So I've heard.

39:21.172 --> 39:25.762
Every man must be tested
before he can be trusted.

39:26.930 --> 39:29.132
Have you eaten?

39:29.232 --> 39:31.040
No, sir.

39:34.604 --> 39:36.506
The King and Crown pub.

39:36.606 --> 39:39.829
You'll find no better meal
nor a better place to...

39:39.929 --> 39:44.214
find out what convictions
you may or may not have.

39:44.314 --> 39:47.684
Try the lamb. It is excellent.

39:48.584 --> 39:50.654
Thank you, sir.
You're very kind, Mr. Franklin.

39:50.754 --> 39:53.196
You're very welcome, Mister...

39:53.723 --> 39:57.233
Flack. Jeremiah Flack.

40:06.936 --> 40:08.671
I reckon he stays.

40:08.771 --> 40:12.863
No, I give him five minutes.
Mark my time.

40:15.145 --> 40:19.589
So I called him a rebel dog
and kicked him out of my shop.

40:24.354 --> 40:26.863
Hear, hear. Long live the King.

40:36.632 --> 40:41.944
Ale, please. Your place comes
recommended. Mr. Charles Kemp.

40:43.907 --> 40:46.142
You're a disaster.

40:46.242 --> 40:48.685
Franklin rejected you as well.

40:52.382 --> 40:55.719
That nest... is ripe for kindling?

40:56.419 --> 41:00.556
I've never seen you here before.
You with Harrison's men?

41:00.656 --> 41:02.525
Harrison?

41:02.625 --> 41:05.001
That thundering cur?

41:05.528 --> 41:07.770
I wouldn't leave him my scraps.

41:08.164 --> 41:10.834
He remains loyal to our King.

41:11.434 --> 41:13.036
Hush, hush!

41:13.136 --> 41:15.863
And to his lying father, the devil.

41:16.507 --> 41:19.142
A grown child should have
independence from its mother.

41:19.442 --> 41:23.907
And for that mother to hold its child,
against its conscience, against its will,

41:24.147 --> 41:25.855
is that not tyranny?

41:27.717 --> 41:30.295
Beware, sir.

41:30.642 --> 41:33.089
This is a loyal pub!

41:33.389 --> 41:36.233
- God save the King!
- God save the King!

41:37.861 --> 41:40.235
For loyal pups.

41:53.576 --> 41:56.085
Did you have the lamb?

41:59.615 --> 42:03.553
Pity. What happened, my boy?

42:03.953 --> 42:06.856
Well, it seems I spoke up
for liberty and...

42:06.956 --> 42:09.192
was thrown out on my conviction.

42:09.292 --> 42:11.701
You are a fast learner.

42:13.195 --> 42:17.440
- But have I the makings of a printer?
- Probably not.

42:20.536 --> 42:23.039
But I'm retired, Mr. Flack.

42:23.439 --> 42:27.710
That is, until I return from my duties
with the Continental Congress.

42:27.810 --> 42:30.253
If I should survive that.

42:31.314 --> 42:33.283
Are you in danger, sir?

42:33.383 --> 42:36.953
Why, Mr. Flack, I am always in danger.

42:37.153 --> 42:41.925
He that would give up a little liberty
for security, deserves neither

42:42.025 --> 42:44.301
and loses both.

43:13.222 --> 43:16.390
Charlotte, my dear,
you're looking unhappy.

43:16.490 --> 43:18.995
I am sorry.

43:19.295 --> 43:22.231
But, my dear, this is
an important social occasion.

43:22.331 --> 43:25.898
We're trying to establish ourselves
in the very best circles. So smile!

43:25.998 --> 43:28.638
Yes. Yes, of course.

43:28.738 --> 43:32.108
- You may depend on me.
- Good girl.

43:32.608 --> 43:36.012
- Yes?
- Factory shop, it's burning.

43:36.112 --> 43:37.614
Oh, no!

43:37.714 --> 43:40.650
- Send all the men we can spare.
- Yes, sir.

43:40.750 --> 43:43.751
My dear... my dear, I think...

43:43.851 --> 43:47.523
perhaps it's time for you to withdraw
with the other ladies. Yes?

43:47.623 --> 43:49.232
Yes.

44:15.718 --> 44:17.960
This looks familiar.

44:19.322 --> 44:21.257
Mr. Flack?

44:21.357 --> 44:23.466
What have you found?

44:25.061 --> 44:27.503
A Leyden charge jar.

44:28.264 --> 44:32.702
- You know it?
- It stores an electrical pulse.

44:32.802 --> 44:37.039
I believe the Europeans came up with it
as a sort of parlor trick.

44:37.139 --> 44:39.248
To shock women.

44:40.109 --> 44:42.318
Or to detonate a bomb.

44:43.579 --> 44:45.988
How do you know about that?

44:46.482 --> 44:48.691
I'm a fast learner.

44:49.685 --> 44:55.156
I thought I was the only man in the colonies
capable of creating such a device.

44:55.792 --> 44:58.828
Now, these jars
don't work by themselves.

44:58.928 --> 45:03.439
One needs a generator to charge them.
I've built one myself.

45:11.173 --> 45:13.349
Most impressive, sir.

45:14.310 --> 45:16.933
Let me demonstrate for you.

45:21.417 --> 45:23.930
Who created that bomb?

45:25.054 --> 45:27.063
I don't know...

45:30.810 --> 45:31.949
for certain.

45:52.181 --> 45:54.017
Doctor!

45:54.617 --> 45:59.288
My dear fellow, I want to congratulate you.
What a superb job you have done.

45:59.388 --> 46:03.459
Pleasure to serve, sir. Pleasure, indeed.
Would you like to see the chamber?

46:03.559 --> 46:06.368
- I...
- Mr. Harrison is here.

46:07.797 --> 46:11.093
Mr. Harrison and gentlemen, welcome.

46:11.193 --> 46:13.402
Welcome, indeed.

46:13.502 --> 46:16.411
- Welcome.
- Thank you, sir.

46:16.606 --> 46:20.739
- What goes on here?
- All in good time, sir.

46:21.277 --> 46:23.262
Gentlemen...

46:23.813 --> 46:28.417
my men and I
are loyal servants of the King.

46:28.517 --> 46:34.590
We fear the consequences
that may come to these 13 colonies...

46:34.690 --> 46:37.927
should these rascals succeed

46:38.027 --> 46:42.179
in unifying their Continental Congress.

46:43.065 --> 46:45.502
But, gentlemen, I have a plan.

46:46.002 --> 46:49.171
When they speak
with their treacherous tongues,

46:49.271 --> 46:53.776
we shall reply with loyal fists.

46:53.876 --> 46:56.879
You will have to recruit

46:56.979 --> 47:00.316
or to destroy those around you.

47:00.416 --> 47:03.786
I look at you now and I ask,
are you willing?

47:03.886 --> 47:05.955
- Yeah!
- Are you willing?

47:06.055 --> 47:07.723
Yeah!

47:07.823 --> 47:11.433
Go, sirs. Go all of you...

47:11.894 --> 47:14.403
and create havoc.

47:21.003 --> 47:23.946
That's quite a lot of work
for a mere cover.

47:25.908 --> 47:28.144
This is not India.

47:28.244 --> 47:31.212
And the cover is half the plan.

47:43.659 --> 47:46.629
- Get this job done.
- Careful, that's a lot of rebel gunpowder.

47:46.729 --> 47:49.672
- I'm trying.
- Just load it on the cart.

47:55.604 --> 47:57.646
What was that?

48:02.641 --> 48:04.720
Where are they?

48:05.881 --> 48:07.753
Maybe loosen this cover.

48:32.074 --> 48:33.377
Stop him!

48:34.844 --> 48:38.014
If he is thwarting loyalists
and scoundrels,

48:38.114 --> 48:41.150
this is the best news
in a very long time.

48:41.250 --> 48:44.486
Well, then, what shall
we call him in our newspaper?

48:44.586 --> 48:48.691
Masked man... mysterious vigilante?

48:48.791 --> 48:51.768
Call him of what he his. The Highwayman.

49:15.751 --> 49:18.861
You were right, sir. He did follow us.

49:19.789 --> 49:22.365
In a mask, was he?

49:24.460 --> 49:26.862
Now we can make of that what we will.

50:02.364 --> 50:04.133
Astonishing.

50:04.233 --> 50:08.370
The Highwayman runs rings around us.

50:08.470 --> 50:11.240
Now how does he know our every move?

50:11.340 --> 50:14.377
Are we compromised? Are your men loyal?

50:14.477 --> 50:18.257
- Yes, sir, they are loyal.
- Get out of my sight.

50:21.784 --> 50:24.868
I'm surrounded by fools.

50:31.327 --> 50:34.122
I will not be made a fool of.

50:44.807 --> 50:47.441
There's sort of...
strange events going on.

50:47.541 --> 50:50.346
Is that not right? You have been talking
about this masked highwayman.

50:50.446 --> 50:52.248
Please, Ms. Charlotte.

50:52.348 --> 50:55.297
Some discussions are best held
after small ears have been put to bed.

50:55.397 --> 50:57.103
Of course. I understand.

50:57.223 --> 51:00.690
But we look forward to hearing
your perspective. This is the new...

51:01.390 --> 51:04.000
Daniel. Daniel Johnson.

51:13.402 --> 51:15.378
Let her go! Sweetheart.

51:25.715 --> 51:29.124
Daniel Johnson is a treasonous
rabble rouser.

51:29.353 --> 51:33.229
Let this be a lesson to him
and to all who would defy the King.

51:39.461 --> 51:41.071
Bring out the tar, men.

51:48.404 --> 51:49.405
No!

51:49.505 --> 51:52.566
Come on, boys. Let's get this job done.

52:36.652 --> 52:40.389
- This is your uncle's doing.
- It's the Night Watch. Scatter!

52:40.489 --> 52:43.192
- Everyone, stop.
- Stand down.

52:43.542 --> 52:47.997
- Stop or we'll shoot.
- I will not be taken. Give me the child.

52:48.397 --> 52:50.038
No!

52:51.032 --> 52:52.708
No!

52:54.670 --> 52:58.947
- He's taking my child!
- Hold your fire!

53:00.275 --> 53:04.019
Lieutenant, catch that horse.
Everyone else, with me.

53:10.352 --> 53:11.727
Fire!

53:32.107 --> 53:33.876
There!

53:33.976 --> 53:35.617
Fire!

54:28.297 --> 54:30.338
Excuse me, sir.

54:31.266 --> 54:34.169
Have you already published the events
on the Johnson house?

54:34.269 --> 54:36.472
No, ma'am. We haven't.

54:36.572 --> 54:39.078
I was there if you care to hear
a first-hand account.

54:39.508 --> 54:41.510
I've written out the details.

54:41.610 --> 54:45.014
The Highwayman, as you call him,
saved our lives,

54:45.114 --> 54:47.907
in spite of what you may have heard
from the watchmen who were...

54:48.007 --> 54:49.952
obviously confused about the event.

54:50.252 --> 54:52.387
There's quite a bit of that
going around, actually.

54:52.487 --> 54:54.329
Jeremiah!

54:54.757 --> 54:57.159
Mr. Flack, your hammer.

54:57.259 --> 54:59.567
Did you say Jeremiah Flack?

55:01.563 --> 55:04.206
Yes, ma'am. Actually, he's right...

55:05.734 --> 55:09.277
Now, that's odd. He was just right there.
Would you like me to find him for you?

55:09.938 --> 55:12.241
No. No.

55:12.341 --> 55:16.245
It is curious, though, I had a servant
by that name in England.

55:16.345 --> 55:18.180
You don't say.

55:18.280 --> 55:20.983
I will leave this account with you.

55:21.083 --> 55:23.619
The Highwayman is a true hero.

55:23.719 --> 55:26.929
The man behind the mask
deserves our deepest admiration.

55:27.489 --> 55:30.594
Indeed. Good day, ma'am.

55:43.772 --> 55:46.277
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

56:00.022 --> 56:02.831
<i>What of the missing papers?</i>

56:03.091 --> 56:05.134
<i>The papers.</i>

56:06.662 --> 56:09.185
<i>I followed your instructions.</i>

56:19.741 --> 56:21.374
You were actually there?

56:21.474 --> 56:25.114
- At the house of a well-known rebel?
- It was a friendly visit. You...

56:25.214 --> 56:28.451
And you proclaimed
the Highwayman a hero?

56:28.851 --> 56:31.787
- Yes. If you had been there...
- Have you any idea of the difficulties

56:31.887 --> 56:35.150
that I've had trying
to re-establish us in good society

56:35.250 --> 56:39.191
after your recent disastrous engagement.

56:46.668 --> 56:49.886
It was one dinner with a very...
polite family.

56:49.986 --> 56:53.375
A polite family. They are rebels.

56:53.575 --> 56:57.853
They are traitors and haven't you seen
the chaos they've been creating.

57:01.817 --> 57:06.128
Yes, I imagine that violence
reminds you of India.

57:07.456 --> 57:09.298
Is that not how it was there?

57:15.330 --> 57:18.300
Charlotte, I think you should
confine yourself to the house

57:18.400 --> 57:20.442
for the next few days.

57:21.336 --> 57:23.812
These are dangerous times.

57:25.040 --> 57:28.416
And I do not want your life jeopardized.

58:45.821 --> 58:48.162
Thank you for meeting me.

58:50.792 --> 58:53.034
It's an honor.

58:55.096 --> 58:59.501
I wanted to thank you
for intervening that night.

58:59.601 --> 59:01.910
And for warning me.

59:02.638 --> 59:06.709
We're all very grateful for your efforts
to stand between the innocent people

59:06.809 --> 59:10.485
and those who wish
to commit violence against them.

59:12.147 --> 59:14.416
Do you include your uncle
in that statement?

59:15.951 --> 59:18.660
So you said he was the cause
of what happened.

59:19.421 --> 59:21.497
I've not wanted to believe you.

59:22.324 --> 59:25.384
Yet I saw him meet with one
of the instigators of that violence.

59:27.863 --> 59:31.940
- What am I to do?
- There's nothing you can do.

59:32.667 --> 59:35.810
- For now.
- Then why are you here?

59:36.238 --> 59:38.179
To warn you.

59:38.907 --> 59:41.176
The annual mayor's ball in New York.

59:41.576 --> 59:44.146
Your uncle has plans for that event.

59:44.246 --> 59:46.315
And so do I.

59:46.415 --> 59:50.091
In the end, the truth will win out.

59:50.752 --> 59:53.996
- I have evidence.
- Evidence?

59:55.457 --> 59:59.134
If that's true, why wait until then?
What stays your hand?

01:00:01.062 --> 01:00:03.004
Ms. Holloway...

01:00:03.732 --> 01:00:06.274
do you believe in redemption?

01:00:06.735 --> 01:00:08.776
Can a man...

01:00:09.304 --> 01:00:11.813
who has made his life a web of lies...

01:00:12.874 --> 01:00:15.116
earn trust again?

01:00:17.379 --> 01:00:20.075
Well, that is a difficult question.

01:00:21.183 --> 01:00:23.681
Of course, I believe in forgiveness.

01:00:23.781 --> 01:00:27.714
It helps if... that man is willing...

01:00:27.814 --> 01:00:30.554
to set aside his deception.

01:00:34.196 --> 01:00:37.505
- I'm sorry. Someone's coming.
- Charlotte.

01:00:48.176 --> 01:00:50.579
You knew a man once...

01:00:51.179 --> 01:00:54.789
who was charged with many crimes
he did not commit.

01:00:55.851 --> 01:00:58.320
And the crimes he did commit...

01:00:58.420 --> 01:01:00.829
are a heavy burden upon him still.

01:01:01.756 --> 01:01:05.500
- Will...
- He had much to repay.

01:01:17.839 --> 01:01:20.015
I lied to you.

01:01:22.644 --> 01:01:25.213
I lied to you about many things,

01:01:25.313 --> 01:01:28.377
but I never lied to you about us.

01:01:35.057 --> 01:01:37.866
<i>I never thought I'd see you again.</i>

01:01:40.128 --> 01:01:43.404
William, what's happening?
I don't understand.

01:01:44.533 --> 01:01:46.508
I love you.

01:01:48.370 --> 01:01:50.839
And I wanted you to know.

01:01:50.939 --> 01:01:53.208
You of all people.

01:01:54.075 --> 01:01:56.578
- That William Reynolds...
- Charlotte.

01:01:56.678 --> 01:01:58.414
- I must go.
- No.

01:01:58.514 --> 01:02:00.288
Charlotte.

01:02:04.285 --> 01:02:07.929
There you are.
I thought you had retired.

01:02:08.806 --> 01:02:10.848
Was there someone...

01:02:11.593 --> 01:02:13.762
Anyway, there was something
I've got to tell you.

01:02:13.862 --> 01:02:18.667
Once a year in New York,
they throw a masquerade ball.

01:02:18.767 --> 01:02:21.042
Everyone attends.

01:02:22.070 --> 01:02:26.090
I was wondering whether you would care
to accompany your old uncle.

01:03:29.204 --> 01:03:31.245
My apologies.

01:03:49.491 --> 01:03:51.593
May I have this dance?

01:03:51.693 --> 01:03:53.535
Why, hardly.

01:03:54.462 --> 01:03:56.798
Duke of Kent's Waltz, do you know it?

01:03:56.898 --> 01:04:00.408
- No.
- Then follow my lead.

01:04:10.311 --> 01:04:12.620
You look lovely this evening.

01:04:13.565 --> 01:04:16.858
Making it difficult for me to keep
my eyes on General Washington.

01:04:18.820 --> 01:04:21.529
Why are you watching General Washington?

01:04:24.459 --> 01:04:27.195
My uncle wouldn't dare do anything
to harm the General.

01:04:27.295 --> 01:04:29.497
Not in front of so many witnesses.

01:04:29.597 --> 01:04:33.675
Are you so certain?
He has used bombs before.

01:04:39.040 --> 01:04:42.310
I may need to call upon you to
corroborate me before the night is over.

01:04:42.410 --> 01:04:45.419
William, I need to know
that I can trust you.

01:04:46.548 --> 01:04:50.314
You can, my dear. I will show you.

01:04:54.222 --> 01:04:57.542
Promise me... whatever happens,

01:04:57.642 --> 01:05:01.870
you will tell the truth.
Please, no more lies.

01:05:02.463 --> 01:05:04.296
Yes, Charlotte.

01:05:04.396 --> 01:05:06.395
I promise.

01:05:07.502 --> 01:05:09.311
No more.

01:05:16.144 --> 01:05:19.220
He's here. And he's wearing the jacket.

01:05:29.908 --> 01:05:32.524
Might I bother you to spend...

01:05:39.167 --> 01:05:41.209
I must go.

01:06:08.797 --> 01:06:11.519
- He attacked the General.
- What's this, then?

01:06:11.619 --> 01:06:14.269
- You're in danger, sir.
- I saw it all, General.

01:06:14.369 --> 01:06:16.874
- This man came at you with that knife.
- That's not true.

01:06:16.974 --> 01:06:20.509
I saw it as well.
He tried to assassinate you, sir.

01:06:20.609 --> 01:06:22.010
Who are you?

01:06:22.110 --> 01:06:24.079
- I'm...
- I know who he is.

01:06:24.579 --> 01:06:26.388
Mr. Kemp.

01:06:28.383 --> 01:06:32.725
I believe that you have read about
this fellow in your English newspapers.

01:06:33.588 --> 01:06:35.157
That...

01:06:35.257 --> 01:06:38.265
is the notorious villain...

01:06:38.993 --> 01:06:41.302
William Reynolds.

01:06:42.197 --> 01:06:45.360
Is that not the barbarian who committed
the atrocities in India?

01:06:45.460 --> 01:06:48.312
- The very one, sir.
- Did he not die?

01:06:48.412 --> 01:06:50.555
General, all you've read is a lie...

01:06:50.655 --> 01:06:53.925
put forth by Charles Kemp because
of what I know from my service to him.

01:06:54.025 --> 01:06:58.813
- Take him away, sir.
- Wait. Let him continue.

01:06:58.913 --> 01:07:03.251
I have evidence... proving
that Charles Kemp was a guiding force

01:07:03.351 --> 01:07:06.621
behind the violence committed in India
by the East India Company.

01:07:06.721 --> 01:07:10.431
And more recently, the violence
committed in Philadelphia.

01:07:11.559 --> 01:07:15.845
Once you see it, you'll agree. He should
be arrested and stand trial for his crimes.

01:07:22.737 --> 01:07:24.962
What is this farce?

01:07:27.175 --> 01:07:29.411
Is this some kind of joke?

01:07:30.011 --> 01:07:33.448
General, listen to me.
The package has been switched.

01:07:33.948 --> 01:07:36.685
It originally contained a report
I obtained nine months ago

01:07:36.785 --> 01:07:39.420
outlining Mr. Kemp's misdeeds in India.

01:07:39.520 --> 01:07:42.290
Let us suppose this document
really existed,

01:07:42.390 --> 01:07:45.460
it would have prevented
the bombings in Philadelphia.

01:07:45.660 --> 01:07:49.781
As you yourself have said, it's been
in your possession for nine months.

01:07:49.881 --> 01:07:55.977
Now, what innocent man would not have
handed it over directly to the authorities?

01:08:03.978 --> 01:08:05.487
Charlotte.

01:08:11.652 --> 01:08:15.997
Son... are you William Reynolds?

01:08:18.326 --> 01:08:21.350
Yes... I am.

01:08:24.765 --> 01:08:27.035
If the evidence is as it appears,

01:08:27.135 --> 01:08:31.045
then this man hangs at dawn
for spying and armed sedition.

01:08:31.839 --> 01:08:33.895
Take him away.

01:08:34.843 --> 01:08:38.886
You and Charlotte
were never the same sort.

01:08:50.758 --> 01:08:52.500
Will.

01:09:19.953 --> 01:09:22.462
- William.
- Charlotte.

01:09:25.026 --> 01:09:26.304
I kept my promise.

01:09:27.328 --> 01:09:29.470
I told the truth.

01:09:31.198 --> 01:09:34.575
But I was at fault to put all my trust
in that Parliamentary Report.

01:09:35.370 --> 01:09:39.340
- Now it's gone.
- I don't understand what's happening.

01:09:39.439 --> 01:09:43.211
You told me you had evidence.
Why... why did you wait?

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:46.147
Could you have stopped
the killing in Philadelphia?

01:09:46.247 --> 01:09:48.622
I waited because of you.

01:09:50.752 --> 01:09:54.049
- I did it all for you.
- For me?

01:09:55.223 --> 01:09:59.891
I've been trying to become the man
that is... somehow worthy of you.

01:10:01.562 --> 01:10:04.038
Of the respect you once gave me.

01:10:07.118 --> 01:10:10.086
William, do you mean
to tell me that you...

01:10:10.538 --> 01:10:15.276
You were letting people die to somehow
earn redemption? Or my love?

01:10:15.376 --> 01:10:17.679
I... I've known no other path.

01:10:17.779 --> 01:10:21.356
I fooled myself into thinking
that I could be a good man.

01:10:23.551 --> 01:10:25.720
That God would hear me.

01:10:25.820 --> 01:10:28.122
Don't you know...

01:10:28.222 --> 01:10:31.636
neither redemption or love

01:10:31.736 --> 01:10:34.068
can ever be earned.

01:10:35.229 --> 01:10:37.899
You have but to ask.

01:10:37.999 --> 01:10:39.867
They're both gifts...

01:10:39.967 --> 01:10:44.112
gifts to be granted freely
from the heart of God.

01:10:45.840 --> 01:10:48.052
And from my heart to yours.

01:11:13.968 --> 01:11:15.837
You're a genius, sir.

01:11:16.037 --> 01:11:18.272
No, it was easy actually.

01:11:18.372 --> 01:11:21.549
He was in business
for himself all along.

01:11:21.976 --> 01:11:24.352
Charlotte, my dear.

01:11:29.016 --> 01:11:31.619
Is there news from Philadelphia?

01:11:32.186 --> 01:11:36.925
The Doctor's arrived. Mr. Jefferson
completed the Declaration...

01:11:37.025 --> 01:11:39.494
to be read to Congress in the morning,

01:11:39.594 --> 01:11:41.669
then voted on.

01:11:41.796 --> 01:11:44.205
In the morning?

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:55.250
Lord...

01:11:58.963 --> 01:12:01.928
despite the crimes of this man,

01:12:03.484 --> 01:12:05.124
I know you know them fully...

01:12:08.289 --> 01:12:10.944
<i>I pray you redeem his life.</i>

01:12:11.044 --> 01:12:13.328
<i>Redeem him.</i>

01:12:15.563 --> 01:12:19.360
<i>And if I am to take part in your mercy,</i>

01:12:23.537 --> 01:12:26.600
please instruct me in what I must do.

01:12:34.398 --> 01:12:37.618
The entire city will be in ashes,
all in a matter of seconds.

01:12:37.718 --> 01:12:40.555
Brilliant, Doctor. Brilliant.

01:12:40.655 --> 01:12:42.300
Remote detonation.

01:12:43.958 --> 01:12:48.763
The entire Continental Congress
will cease to exist.

01:12:48.863 --> 01:12:52.667
And the best of all the blame
will fall on William Reynolds,

01:12:52.767 --> 01:12:55.836
the colony's very own Guy Fawkes.

01:12:55.936 --> 01:13:00.441
Saucy knave. Believed he was
good enough to marry my niece.

01:13:00.541 --> 01:13:03.144
I begin to suspect her loyalty, sir.

01:13:03.244 --> 01:13:07.815
If she so much as visits his grave,
I want her dead.

01:13:07.915 --> 01:13:12.595
She becomes more like her
sanctimonious father every day.

01:13:15.790 --> 01:13:18.603
Reverend, I had a deal with God.

01:13:21.662 --> 01:13:24.332
But it turns out the name
William Reynolds...

01:13:24.432 --> 01:13:27.280
was too evil for even him to redeem.

01:13:29.070 --> 01:13:31.728
I'll be getting what I deserve tomorrow.

01:13:37.778 --> 01:13:42.933
Actually, someone else
already got what you deserve.

01:13:53.094 --> 01:13:56.613
- <i>Visitor for the condemned man.</i>
- <i>He's in the hold.</i>

01:13:56.713 --> 01:14:01.771
<i>It's a lady. She wishes
to see him up on the main deck.</i>

01:14:28.929 --> 01:14:31.432
- You shouldn't be here.
- I had to see you.

01:14:31.532 --> 01:14:34.268
I did not know who else to turn to.

01:14:34.368 --> 01:14:35.770
I beg your pardon.

01:14:39.390 --> 01:14:40.749
Have they hurt you?

01:14:50.885 --> 01:14:53.124
I never told you.

01:14:54.288 --> 01:14:56.331
The night I escaped Adlesbury...

01:14:59.159 --> 01:15:00.955
Jeremiah...

01:15:01.055 --> 01:15:03.374
he gave his life for me.

01:15:08.669 --> 01:15:13.081
I realized tonight that that's
the same thing that Christ did for me.

01:15:15.072 --> 01:15:17.385
I saw myself fully for who I am.

01:15:21.515 --> 01:15:24.187
And I have strived in vain...

01:15:24.785 --> 01:15:27.161
to redeem my name.

01:15:28.022 --> 01:15:31.092
But, God, in His mercy...

01:15:31.392 --> 01:15:33.761
he has done the work
that I could never do.

01:15:33.861 --> 01:15:36.904
He has redeemed my name
and he has given me his.

01:15:38.499 --> 01:15:41.017
William... truly?

01:15:41.117 --> 01:15:42.704
Yes.

01:15:42.804 --> 01:15:47.282
I have found acceptance in the divine heart
that I've sought in vain all my life.

01:15:48.242 --> 01:15:49.810
- Will, I came...
- I tried.

01:15:49.910 --> 01:15:52.179
I grew to love the life
of Steven Walters.

01:15:52.279 --> 01:15:55.550
- So did I.
- But it was a stolen name.

01:15:56.250 --> 01:15:58.352
It was just another mask.

01:15:58.452 --> 01:16:01.255
- Will...
- It was a love you couldn't return.

01:16:01.355 --> 01:16:04.338
William, you'll have to save me.

01:16:04.438 --> 01:16:06.167
What?

01:16:08.195 --> 01:16:09.670
Charlotte!

01:16:11.565 --> 01:16:13.086
Woman overboard!

01:16:13.386 --> 01:16:15.442
Woman overboard!

01:16:16.537 --> 01:16:19.012
Where's she? Where?

01:16:27.381 --> 01:16:30.754
Prisoner overboard! Prisoner overboard!

01:16:30.854 --> 01:16:32.692
There they are!

01:16:33.354 --> 01:16:36.230
No. Don't shoot the lady.

01:16:38.092 --> 01:16:40.377
I wasn't even trying to kiss you.

01:16:40.477 --> 01:16:43.280
My uncle plans to destroy
the assembly in Philadelphia.

01:16:43.430 --> 01:16:45.206
They're right down there!

01:16:47.935 --> 01:16:49.810
William?

01:16:55.342 --> 01:16:57.351
There she is.

01:16:58.679 --> 01:17:01.289
Here you go, miss. Give me your hand.

01:17:07.655 --> 01:17:09.731
- There you go.
- Where is he?

01:17:11.926 --> 01:17:13.234
What's that?

01:17:20.734 --> 01:17:22.576
Well done.

01:17:26.874 --> 01:17:29.964
Charlotte? Charlotte?

01:17:35.883 --> 01:17:39.286
- You are quite resourceful.
- Oh, well, you never asked.

01:17:39.386 --> 01:17:41.422
I'm an old hand at escaping
prison ships.

01:17:42.122 --> 01:17:46.160
- Do you intend that I row all the way?
- You could stay to be hanged,

01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:49.070
or know that I chartered a carriage.

01:18:03.644 --> 01:18:05.819
Where did you find those?

01:18:06.947 --> 01:18:09.290
They were in my uncle's office.

01:18:10.717 --> 01:18:12.060
You stole these?

01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:17.492
Borrowed. I have every intention
of returning them in Philadelphia.

01:18:18.592 --> 01:18:21.068
Can you make sense of these?

01:18:23.497 --> 01:18:26.339
- "City in ashes", he said.
- Mr. Franklin will be of help.

01:18:26.439 --> 01:18:28.709
What are these symbols?

01:18:31.371 --> 01:18:33.574
Explosive devices.

01:18:34.074 --> 01:18:35.949
Guy Fawkes.

01:18:36.093 --> 01:18:37.561
What?

01:18:37.911 --> 01:18:40.514
The man who plotted to blow up
Parliament during the vote.

01:18:40.714 --> 01:18:43.992
Charles... he's planning
to blow up the Congress.

01:18:55.963 --> 01:18:57.264
What...

01:18:57.764 --> 01:19:00.301
You do know you've chartered
a smuggler's carriage.

01:19:08.242 --> 01:19:10.177
Are you stealing those?

01:19:10.277 --> 01:19:12.052
Borrowing.

01:19:56.523 --> 01:19:58.398
Pray for me.

01:19:58.642 --> 01:20:00.882
You're not the same man.

01:20:02.463 --> 01:20:05.226
I can't save you, William Reynolds.

01:20:13.073 --> 01:20:16.186
- Stay where you are safe.
- The Johnsons.

01:20:17.778 --> 01:20:21.154
- I will look for you there.
- I love you.

01:20:22.950 --> 01:20:24.992
I love you.

01:20:42.936 --> 01:20:44.893
That's her.

01:20:45.806 --> 01:20:47.541
- Let me go!
- You're coming with us.

01:20:47.641 --> 01:20:50.104
- Get your hands off me!
- Charlotte!

01:20:50.204 --> 01:20:53.548
- No.
- Your uncle is looking for you.

01:20:54.048 --> 01:20:55.823
You have betrayed your family.

01:21:18.425 --> 01:21:22.042
Mr. Franklin, get everyone out.
There a plan afoot to bomb this building.

01:21:22.142 --> 01:21:25.379
More nonsense!
We cannot afford any longer delay.

01:21:25.479 --> 01:21:27.915
Wait! I know him.

01:21:28.415 --> 01:21:30.491
No, you don't, sirs.

01:21:30.968 --> 01:21:32.288
I am William Reynolds.

01:21:32.388 --> 01:21:35.155
Former mercenary of the East India
Company, and currently a fugitive.

01:21:35.255 --> 01:21:38.092
Oh, good. Nothing serious then.

01:21:38.492 --> 01:21:41.396
Make of me what you will, sirs.
But the threat is real.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:43.203
Take him in hand.

01:22:28.142 --> 01:22:31.985
- Gunpowder.
- A lot of gunpowder.

01:22:33.981 --> 01:22:37.651
- How soon until the vote?
- At noon.

01:22:37.751 --> 01:22:41.088
- But, who would...
- Charles Kemp.

01:22:41.188 --> 01:22:43.646
East India Company.

01:23:03.643 --> 01:23:05.179
What is this place?

01:23:05.279 --> 01:23:08.623
Come find out for yourself,
Ms. Holloway.

01:23:28.068 --> 01:23:30.276
Sir, your niece is here.

01:23:31.505 --> 01:23:34.589
Basil tells me you've been
a naughty girl.

01:23:36.243 --> 01:23:39.820
I'm sorry, my dear,
but you've chosen the wrong side.

01:23:49.389 --> 01:23:51.816
Electric fuses.

01:23:52.626 --> 01:23:55.149
That should take care of it.

01:24:39.106 --> 01:24:41.348
Capacitors are charging.

01:24:52.986 --> 01:24:57.711
Behold, Charlotte...
the Doctor's ingenious machine.

01:24:58.542 --> 01:25:02.586
He uses the windmill to turn
this wheel, which, in turn...

01:25:02.686 --> 01:25:05.847
generates Mr. Franklin's...

01:25:05.947 --> 01:25:08.506
invisible lightning.

01:25:09.136 --> 01:25:11.238
And when I throw that lever,

01:25:11.338 --> 01:25:16.276
it moves from the jars
to the accumulator up there.

01:25:16.776 --> 01:25:20.387
Once it has achieved sufficient power,

01:25:20.514 --> 01:25:25.285
it releases itself, traveling through wires
that we have placed under the city,

01:25:25.385 --> 01:25:30.290
utilizing Mr. Franklin's
brand new sewage system.

01:25:30.390 --> 01:25:33.894
And where does that electricity
finally terminate?

01:25:33.994 --> 01:25:37.565
Barrels of gunpowder,
strategically placed.

01:25:38.765 --> 01:25:42.625
We've discovered
a practical use for electricity.

01:25:43.870 --> 01:25:45.674
How many people do you intend to kill?

01:25:47.574 --> 01:25:49.602
Oh, how many people
do you believe would die

01:25:49.702 --> 01:25:52.816
if there is an extended war
between England and the colonies?

01:25:52.916 --> 01:25:54.198
How many?

01:25:55.949 --> 01:25:59.277
How many people will die?

01:26:01.454 --> 01:26:03.096
Enough!

01:26:05.025 --> 01:26:08.127
So that their desire for independence
is overwhelmed

01:26:08.227 --> 01:26:11.264
by their need for law and order.

01:26:11.364 --> 01:26:13.516
Provided by you.

01:26:13.616 --> 01:26:16.257
Who else could be entrusted with it?

01:26:16.520 --> 01:26:20.407
Now, I'm sorry, my dear, but this chamber
is rigged to detonate with the city.

01:26:20.507 --> 01:26:24.390
The Doctor and I will be leaving,
of course. You will not.

01:26:24.490 --> 01:26:26.736
Basil, bind her.

01:26:39.459 --> 01:26:41.802
God have mercy.

01:26:50.804 --> 01:26:53.140
They intend to blow up the entire city.

01:26:53.540 --> 01:26:56.276
How would you harness
this much electricity?

01:26:56.376 --> 01:26:59.613
- Lightning?
- Too unreliable.

01:26:59.713 --> 01:27:02.349
A scientist might manufacture it,

01:27:02.449 --> 01:27:06.906
but the generator would have to be
quite large and at a central location.

01:27:08.989 --> 01:27:12.159
The wires. The wires
will lead me to the generator.

01:27:12.259 --> 01:27:14.668
Disarm as many as you're able.

01:27:16.763 --> 01:27:18.972
You may need this.

01:27:23.623 --> 01:27:25.546
Godspeed, my son.

01:28:03.943 --> 01:28:06.713
The detonation switch
is engaged, Mr. Kemp.

01:28:06.813 --> 01:28:08.188
Five minutes.

01:28:12.749 --> 01:28:16.129
Get this job done, boys.
It's time to depart.

01:28:17.758 --> 01:28:20.027
- There he is!
- It's the Highwayman.

01:28:20.127 --> 01:28:22.336
Take him! No mistakes.

01:28:23.096 --> 01:28:26.540
Tell Harrison to steepen
the pitch on the blades.

01:28:28.869 --> 01:28:30.270
Will!

01:28:30.370 --> 01:28:32.472
I'm afraid Mr. Harrison
is asleep on the job.

01:28:32.572 --> 01:28:36.376
I will ensure that Mr. Harrison
never wakes up.

01:28:36.476 --> 01:28:40.186
- Charlotte.
- The chamber is rigged to explode.

01:28:40.714 --> 01:28:43.657
- I may need your help.
- Get rid of him.

01:28:59.932 --> 01:29:02.369
More power, Doctor.
We must speed this up.

01:29:02.469 --> 01:29:04.520
Yes, Mr. Kemp.

01:29:09.776 --> 01:29:12.288
Faster, Doctor. Faster.

01:29:14.714 --> 01:29:16.857
The accumulator is nearly full.

01:29:18.118 --> 01:29:20.601
Capacitors are activated, Doctor.

01:29:20.701 --> 01:29:23.330
The generator is at maximum speed.

01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:43.750
- The accumulator malfunctioned.
- Fix it.

01:29:53.486 --> 01:29:56.823
- Pull the lever!
- It's not ready yet.

01:29:56.923 --> 01:29:59.492
A misfire could trigger an explosion.

01:29:59.592 --> 01:30:02.405
The accumulator needs to charge again.

01:30:03.063 --> 01:30:04.450
I'll charge it.

01:30:24.851 --> 01:30:26.052
No!

01:30:27.487 --> 01:30:30.931
Mr. Kemp... we're out of time.
We must leave.

01:30:33.827 --> 01:30:36.136
Not without the city in ashes.

01:30:39.165 --> 01:30:41.368
You are horrified, Charlotte,

01:30:41.468 --> 01:30:44.638
to see the real man behind the mask.

01:30:44.738 --> 01:30:46.998
You're a monster.

01:30:47.690 --> 01:30:52.228
We all have to come to terms
with our contradictions.

01:30:53.913 --> 01:30:55.949
I have.

01:31:01.354 --> 01:31:03.223
You must pull that lever back.

01:31:03.323 --> 01:31:07.445
Prepare for your independence,
Mr. Franklin.

01:31:08.461 --> 01:31:11.659
I cannot allow you to do that, my dear.

01:31:16.069 --> 01:31:18.505
Mr. Kemp, please.

01:31:18.605 --> 01:31:21.081
The machine is unstable.

01:31:24.144 --> 01:31:26.980
Will. Will...

01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:29.816
do you believe you can stop destiny?

01:31:29.916 --> 01:31:31.351
10 seconds, Mr. Kemp.

01:31:31.451 --> 01:31:34.587
If you pull those wires,
you will certainly die.

01:31:36.189 --> 01:31:38.451
Come on, Will.

01:31:38.551 --> 01:31:42.228
You have made your fortune doing
exactly what I asked you to do.

01:31:42.328 --> 01:31:44.464
I know you.

01:31:44.564 --> 01:31:46.616
This is not what you want.

01:31:46.716 --> 01:31:48.533
You are right, Mr. Kemp.

01:31:50.770 --> 01:31:52.319
This isn't what I want.

01:31:53.423 --> 01:31:56.484
But I'm not in business
for myself any longer.

01:32:27.106 --> 01:32:30.210
By a unanimous vote
of the Continental Congress,

01:32:30.310 --> 01:32:33.821
the Declaration of Independence passes.

01:34:19.753 --> 01:34:20.701
You'll pay for this.

01:34:20.801 --> 01:34:23.575
- Be quiet. Come on.
- You hear me? You'll pay for this.

01:34:24.123 --> 01:34:27.661
What is this? Wait!
Wait. What's going on?

01:34:27.761 --> 01:34:29.863
A dispatch has arrived from New York.

01:34:29.963 --> 01:34:32.632
It seems, you are indeed a wanted man.

01:34:32.732 --> 01:34:35.123
- Just as you said.
- What?

01:34:35.223 --> 01:34:38.072
Sir, this is ridiculous.
He needs a doctor. He's injured.

01:34:43.977 --> 01:34:46.229
You're just going to hang him,
after all of this.

01:34:46.329 --> 01:34:51.558
We have not yet decided whether we are
going to allow his extradition to New York.

01:35:01.594 --> 01:35:03.796
I cannot ask you to accompany me.

01:35:03.896 --> 01:35:07.233
Will, I pulled you out
of a pond as a stranger.

01:35:07.667 --> 01:35:10.276
Do you think I would abandon you now?

01:35:10.803 --> 01:35:13.082
I do not know what lies ahead.

01:35:13.806 --> 01:35:16.176
Mr. Franklin will defend you.

01:35:16.576 --> 01:35:18.784
As will I.

01:35:23.116 --> 01:35:25.719
From the first time I met you...

01:35:26.119 --> 01:35:29.461
I have been captivated
by the depths of your kindness.

01:35:31.741 --> 01:35:34.283
You were unconscious on that day.

01:35:44.971 --> 01:35:47.147
Well, I'm not now.

01:35:56.015 --> 01:35:58.785
Since the day
we last parted, I've been...

01:35:59.185 --> 01:36:02.718
trying to earn the right
to give you this ring.

01:36:04.390 --> 01:36:07.313
You told me, I have but to ask.

01:36:09.195 --> 01:36:11.137
I'm asking.

01:36:11.430 --> 01:36:13.966
Could you see fit
to let me care for you...

01:36:14.066 --> 01:36:16.441
as you have for me?

01:36:18.371 --> 01:36:20.013
Yes.

01:36:20.773 --> 01:36:23.159
Yes. Yes.

01:36:23.259 --> 01:36:24.911
Yes.

01:36:25.011 --> 01:36:28.989
Of course. With all my heart, yes.

01:36:42.829 --> 01:36:45.316
Then let it be God's will.

01:36:46.466 --> 01:36:48.407
You are.

01:36:49.802 --> 01:36:54.435
Come to think of it, our extradition laws
are rather ambiguous.

01:36:58.911 --> 01:37:01.931
I hope you know what you are doing.

01:37:16.646 --> 01:37:18.254
What is that?

01:37:20.933 --> 01:37:23.370
Oh, it's from Mr. Franklin.

01:37:23.619 --> 01:37:26.202
"To the most honorable William Reynolds.

01:37:27.039 --> 01:37:29.576
"You have rendered
a great service to our country,

01:37:29.676 --> 01:37:33.069
"for that I am grateful,
as others would be if they knew.

01:37:33.379 --> 01:37:35.481
"But they must never know.

01:37:35.581 --> 01:37:40.059
"The true battle is only just beginning.
We may have need for you again.

01:37:42.521 --> 01:37:45.675
"This coach will convey you not to jail,

01:37:45.775 --> 01:37:47.649
"but to my home...

01:37:47.749 --> 01:37:50.837
"where you may take whatever
restorative measures you must..."

01:37:50.937 --> 01:37:52.587
"and...
