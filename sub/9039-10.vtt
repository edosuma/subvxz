WEBVTT

00:03.233 --> 00:04.433
- WELL, FIRST OF ALL,

00:04.433 --> 00:06.167
MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY
ARE SO CUTE.

00:06.167 --> 00:08.133
- [laughing]
THANK YOU.

00:08.133 --> 00:10.233
- THEY'RE VERY FRIENDLY
AND HELPFUL

00:10.233 --> 00:12.133
AND ALL THE KIDS LOVE THEM,
I LOVE THEM.

00:12.133 --> 00:14.167
- WELL, THANK YOU.

00:14.167 --> 00:15.767
- THEY ARE VERY SPECIAL,

00:15.767 --> 00:18.000
AND THEY'RE SO EXCITED
ABOUT DOING A COMEDY ROUTINE

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
AT THE WINTER CONCERT.

00:19.000 --> 00:20.367
IT'S SO CUTE!

00:20.367 --> 00:22.200
YOU MUST BE VERY PROUD.
- OH, YEAH.

00:22.200 --> 00:23.400
- WINTER CONCERT?

00:23.400 --> 00:26.033
- YEAH, RAY.
YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:26.033 --> 00:27.567
- OH, YEAH,
I KNOW ABOUT THAT.

00:27.567 --> 00:31.200
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
IT'S WINTER ALREADY.

00:31.200 --> 00:33.133
- HE'S BEEN PRACTICING
THEIR ROUTINE WITH THEM.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.733
HE'S THIS TOTALLY
INVOLVED DAD, YOU KNOW?

00:35.733 --> 00:37.233
- YEAH, AND IF YOU NEED ANY HELP

00:37.233 --> 00:40.100
TELLING THEM APART,
I'M YOUR GUY.

00:40.100 --> 00:41.600
- WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S GOTTEN EASIER.

00:41.600 --> 00:43.267
BUT THERE ARE SOME
DIFFERENCES.

00:43.267 --> 00:45.300
- YEAH, YOU START SEEING
IT AROUND THE EYES, RIGHT?

00:45.300 --> 00:47.800
- SURE, THAT, AND THEN THERE
ARE SOME OTHER DIFF--

00:47.800 --> 00:50.100
WELL, LET'S SEE.
UM...

00:50.100 --> 00:52.800
THESE ARE THE PRE-K
ASSESSMENT FORMS,

00:52.800 --> 00:54.433
AND HERE ARE SOME NUMBERS,

00:54.433 --> 00:55.700
AND THEY BOTH
KNOW THEIR NUMBERS,

00:55.700 --> 00:57.133
BUT THEY EACH
GOT THE NINE WRONG.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.400
THEY SAID IT WAS A SIX.

00:58.400 --> 00:59.700
THAT'S A COMMON ERROR.

00:59.700 --> 01:01.233
- BUT, YOU KNOW,
I GUESS,

01:01.233 --> 01:04.733
IF YOU SHOWED IT
TO THEM LIKE THIS, RIGHT?

01:04.733 --> 01:06.367
I MEAN,
IT COULD'VE BEEN UPSIDE DOWN.

01:06.367 --> 01:10.533
- UH, NO.
WE SHOW IT TO THEM LIKE THIS.

01:10.533 --> 01:12.067
- OH.
- BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S A--

01:12.067 --> 01:13.733
- COMMON.
IT'S A COMMON ERROR.

01:16.500 --> 01:18.767
- AND, UH,
WELL, HERE ARE SOME LETTERS,

01:18.767 --> 01:20.433
AND THEY BOTH KNOW
ALL THEIR LETTERS.

01:20.433 --> 01:21.967
- WELL, I DO THAT
WITH THEM EVERY DAY.

01:21.967 --> 01:23.333
[singing] A, B, C, D--

01:23.333 --> 01:26.967
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT SONG.
[laughing]

01:26.967 --> 01:28.400
- YOU OKAY?

01:31.200 --> 01:33.400
- SOMETHING BAD
IS COMING.

01:35.033 --> 01:36.033
AM I RIGHT?

01:36.033 --> 01:37.433
- NO, NO, NOT AT ALL.

01:37.433 --> 01:39.267
LET'S JUST, UM--
OH, HERE.

01:39.267 --> 01:40.967
THIS IS A TEST
WHERE THE CHILD IS ASKED

01:40.967 --> 01:42.800
TO CUT WITH SCISSORS
ON THE LINE.

01:42.800 --> 01:44.400
SO, HERE'S GEOFFREY.

01:44.400 --> 01:45.967
- YEAH,
THAT'S PRETTY GOOD THERE.

01:45.967 --> 01:47.800
- YEAH.
MM-HMM.

01:47.800 --> 01:49.333
AND MICHAEL.

01:57.200 --> 01:59.733
- MICHAEL JUST NEEDS TO WORK
ON THIS SKILL A LITTLE.

01:59.733 --> 02:02.200
- A LITTLE?
WHAT, DID HE CHEW THE PAPER?

02:05.200 --> 02:06.567
- MICHAEL JUST DOESN'T KNOW

02:06.567 --> 02:08.200
HOW TO HOLD
THE SCISSORS PROPERLY,

02:08.200 --> 02:09.967
AND HE SEEMS
A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO TRY.

02:09.967 --> 02:11.367
- SO WHY DO YOU
THINK THAT IS?

02:11.367 --> 02:13.800
- IS HE STUPID?
YOU SHOULD TELL US.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.500
- NO, NO.
NOT AT ALL.

02:16.500 --> 02:18.800
THIS KIND OF THING IS JUST
A SIGN OF SLIGHT IMMATURITY,

02:18.800 --> 02:20.267
THAT'S ALL.

02:20.267 --> 02:22.600
AND MICHAEL MIGHT BE
JUST A LITTLE YOUNG FOR HIS AGE.

02:22.600 --> 02:25.567
- BUT THEY'RE SUPPOSED
TO BE IDENTICAL.

02:27.367 --> 02:29.600
WAS THAT IT?
IS IT JUST THE SCISSOR THING?

02:29.600 --> 02:32.733
- WELL, SEE, HERE'S SOME SHAPES,
WHERE THEY DRAW SHAPES.

02:32.733 --> 02:34.833
SO, HERE'S GEOFFREY.

02:34.833 --> 02:37.000
AND HERE'S MICHAEL.

02:41.967 --> 02:44.433
AND LET'S SEE...

02:46.767 --> 02:50.100
AND THEN THEY WERE SUPPOSED
TO DRAW PICTURES OF THEMSELVES.

02:50.100 --> 02:52.200
SO HERE'S GEOFFREY.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.333
HERE'S MICHAEL.

02:57.167 --> 02:58.500
AT FIRST HE
DIDN'T WANT TO DRAW,

02:58.500 --> 02:59.900
BUT THEN I TALKED HIM
THROUGH IT

02:59.900 --> 03:02.033
AND JUST LACKS
A LITTLE DETAIL.

03:05.600 --> 03:08.067
- THAT'S A NOSE?
WHAT THE HELL?

03:09.667 --> 03:11.000
- YOU KNOW, UM,

03:11.000 --> 03:13.700
BOYS ARE JUST A LITTLE SLOWER
TO DEVELOP THAN GIRLS.

03:13.700 --> 03:16.167
- BUT GEOFFREY'S DEVELOPING
ON SCHEDULE.

03:16.167 --> 03:18.633
OH, BOY.
MY FATHER'S GONNA LOVE THAT.

03:19.767 --> 03:20.800
- WHAT?

03:20.800 --> 03:23.233
SHUT UP.

03:23.233 --> 03:25.667
- EXCUSE ME?
- NOTHING.

03:25.667 --> 03:29.033
MY FATHER THINKS
THAT GEOFFREY HAS

03:29.033 --> 03:31.267
HOMOSEXUAL TENDENCIES.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.600
BUT, LOOK,

03:35.600 --> 03:37.267
DON'T WORRY ABOUT
WHAT HE THINKS.

03:37.267 --> 03:40.567
HE'S STILL NOT SURE ABOUT ME.
[chuckling]

03:47.200 --> 03:48.867
- WELL, IN MY OPINION,

03:48.867 --> 03:51.133
MICHAEL'S ONLY SLIGHTLY
BEHIND THE OTHER CHILDREN,

03:51.133 --> 03:54.067
AND I'M SURE HE'LL BE FINE
TO MOVE ON TO KINDERGARTEN.

03:55.567 --> 03:57.300
- BUT THERE'S
A QUESTION?

03:57.300 --> 03:58.800
- OH. WELL, NOT WITH ME,

03:58.800 --> 04:01.033
BUT THE KINDERGARTEN TEACHER,
RITA, WILL COME DOWN

04:01.033 --> 04:02.367
AND MAKE HER OWN EVALUATION.

04:02.367 --> 04:05.133
- SO MICHAEL
MIGHT HAVE TO STAY IN PRESCHOOL

04:05.133 --> 04:06.133
FOR ONE MORE YEAR.

04:06.133 --> 04:07.567
- IT--IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES.

04:07.567 --> 04:09.300
AND IT'S BETTER IF IT
HAPPENS IN PRESCHOOL

04:09.300 --> 04:11.800
BECAUSE THERE'S NO SHAME
IN REPEATING AT THIS AGE.

04:11.800 --> 04:13.333
- SURE.
RIGHT.

04:13.333 --> 04:15.200
BUT THIS
KINDERGARTEN LADY, RITA,

04:15.200 --> 04:16.700
SHE'LL MAKE THE CALL?

04:16.700 --> 04:17.700
- YES.

04:17.700 --> 04:19.267
- IS SHE TOUGH?

04:21.600 --> 04:22.800
- UM, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

04:22.800 --> 04:24.433
- YOU KNOW.

04:24.433 --> 04:26.000
[grunts]

04:27.267 --> 04:28.833
YOU REALLY GOT
TO LEAVE HIM BACK?

04:28.833 --> 04:31.567
I MEAN, WHAT ABOUT
THAT OTHER KID I SAW,

04:31.567 --> 04:33.600
THE ONE LICKING
THE BLACKBOARD?

04:37.667 --> 04:40.633
- RAY, IT'S NOT
A COMPETITION.

04:40.633 --> 04:42.967
YOU KNOW,
MY BIGGEST CONCERN

04:42.967 --> 04:45.800
IS SPLITTING UP THE BOYS,
BECAUSE THEY'RE SO CLOSE.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.667
- WELL, I THOUGHT OF THAT,
AND, YOU KNOW,

04:47.667 --> 04:48.800
IF IT COMES DOWN TO IT,

04:48.800 --> 04:50.633
THEY COULD BOTH STAY
IN PRE-K ONE MORE TERM.

04:50.633 --> 04:52.300
AGAIN, THEY'RE ON
THE YOUNGER SIDE,

04:52.300 --> 04:55.233
AND MOVING FORWARD
AT THIS AGE ISN'T CRUCIAL.

04:55.233 --> 04:57.300
- I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE THAT WOULD BE BEST.

04:57.300 --> 05:00.067
I--WHAT
DO YOU THINK?

05:00.067 --> 05:02.267
- IS THE BOARD-LICKER
MOVING UP?

05:12.600 --> 05:14.567
[chilling music]

05:14.567 --> 05:15.567
THEY'RE COMING!

05:15.567 --> 05:21.700
[Beethoven's Ode To Joy playing]

05:39.067 --> 05:40.600
[fire flaring]

05:48.367 --> 05:51.367
[Beethoven's Ode To Joy playing]

05:54.667 --> 05:57.200
- MICHAEL, LIKE THIS.
LIKE THIS.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.667
COME ON.
LIKE THIS.

05:59.667 --> 06:00.733
- I CAN'T.

06:00.733 --> 06:03.800
- UH, YOU--
DON'T GIVE UP, YOU--

06:03.800 --> 06:04.800
- HOW'S IT GOING?

06:04.800 --> 06:06.933
- SHH.
YES.

06:06.933 --> 06:08.767
YOU CAN, MICHAEL.
YOU CAN--THERE YOU GO, SEE?

06:08.767 --> 06:10.300
NOW YOU'RE HOLDING IT.
THAT'S IT.

06:10.300 --> 06:11.300
THERE, YOU'RE HOLDING IT.

06:11.300 --> 06:12.767
OKAY NOW, NOW LET'S CUT.

06:12.767 --> 06:14.167
- I DON'T WANT TO.

06:14.167 --> 06:15.533
- WELL, SURE, YOU DO.

06:15.533 --> 06:19.533
THIS IS GONNA HELP YOU
GET A GOOD JOB SOME DAY.

06:19.533 --> 06:20.533
COME ON.

06:20.533 --> 06:22.100
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

06:22.100 --> 06:24.367
ALL THE MILLIONAIRES
KNOW HOW TO CUT PAPER.

06:24.367 --> 06:25.867
- OKAY, JUST CUT
A STRAIGHT LINE.

06:25.867 --> 06:27.300
GO AHEAD. GO AHEAD.
CUT.

06:27.300 --> 06:28.367
BUT NO, STRAIGHT--

06:28.367 --> 06:29.700
GO STRAIGHT.
GO STRAIGHT.

06:29.700 --> 06:32.767
GO STRAIGHT, MIKE!
STOP--SLOW DOWN. STOP.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.167
GO STRAIGHT ACROSS, OKAY?

06:34.167 --> 06:36.867
NO...NO, NO, NO!

06:36.867 --> 06:38.133
- OKAY,
HEY, HEY, HEY,

06:38.133 --> 06:39.500
MAYBE--MAYBE
THIS ISN'T A GOOD IDEA.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.600
- NO, BUT HE
DOESN'T CUT--

06:40.600 --> 06:41.833
NO!
- IT'S OKAY, RAY.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.467
IT'S OKAY.
- NO!

06:43.467 --> 06:45.267
- I THINK IT'S BETTER
IF HE DOESN'T ASSOCIATE

06:45.267 --> 06:47.467
CUTTING PAPER WITH YOU
FOAMING AT THE MOUTH.

06:48.900 --> 06:51.133
WHY DON'T YOU JUST HELP HIM
WITH HIS COMEDY ROUTINE?

06:51.133 --> 06:52.600
- YEAH, YEAH.
GREAT, GREAT, GREAT.

06:52.600 --> 06:56.467
THAT'S A FUTURE.
"HEY, HEY, FUNNY BOYS!

06:56.467 --> 07:00.400
"PUT ON THESE CHICKEN HEADS
AND HAND OUT THESE COUPONS.

07:00.400 --> 07:01.567
"DON'T WORRY, MICHAEL,

07:01.567 --> 07:03.267
WE CUT THEM OUT
FOR YOU ALREADY."

07:04.767 --> 07:05.800
- HEY.
- HEY, ROBERT.

07:05.800 --> 07:07.600
- ALL RIGHT, MIKE...

07:07.600 --> 07:10.067
GO UPSTAIRS AND--
HERE, PRACTICE CUTTING.

07:10.067 --> 07:11.367
TAKE THE SCISSORS.
GO. RUN.

07:11.367 --> 07:14.733
- NO, DON'T RUN!
DON'T RUN!

07:14.733 --> 07:16.333
IDIOT.

07:19.733 --> 07:22.067
- THIS IS HOW MICHAEL
CUTS PAPER.

07:22.067 --> 07:24.133
- SO WE HATE HIM NOW?

07:25.967 --> 07:28.633
- HE JUST NEEDS TO WORK ON
HIS FINE MOTOR SKILLS A LITTLE.

07:28.633 --> 07:30.667
THEY'RE THINKING
OF KEEPING HIM IN PRE-K

07:30.667 --> 07:31.933
ONE MORE YEAR.

07:31.933 --> 07:33.600
- REALLY?

07:33.600 --> 07:35.600
INTERESTING.

07:35.600 --> 07:37.167
- WHY? WHY IS THAT
INTERESTING?

07:37.167 --> 07:39.067
- OH, NOTHING.

07:39.067 --> 07:40.500
- YOU GOT
ANY DOUGHNUTS?

07:40.500 --> 07:42.267
- DON'T GIVE HIM ANY!
HE ALREADY HAD TWO!

07:42.267 --> 07:43.900
I STILL HAVE COFFEE LEFT!

07:43.900 --> 07:47.000
YOU REFILLED THAT COFFEE SO
YOU COULD HAVE MORE DOUGHNUTS!

07:47.000 --> 07:48.500
- SO SHE ATE THEM!

07:48.500 --> 07:51.267
- THAT'S RIGHT, BECAUSE
TWO DOUGHNUTS ARE ENOUGH.

07:51.267 --> 07:52.933
- WELL, HOW MANY
DID YOU HAVE?

07:52.933 --> 07:54.567
- WHY DO YOU CHANGE
THE SUBJECT?

07:54.567 --> 07:56.700
- ALL RIGHT, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE, WAIT A MINUTE.

07:56.700 --> 07:58.467
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.
I KNOW WHAT TO DO.

07:58.467 --> 07:59.667
GET OUT!

08:02.833 --> 08:04.300
- WHAT'S THE MATTER, DEAR?

08:04.300 --> 08:06.500
- MICHAEL MIGHT GET
LEFT BACK IN PRESCHOOL.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.667
- WHAT?

08:07.667 --> 08:11.133
- OH, INTERESTING.

08:11.133 --> 08:12.367
- WHAT?
WHAT'S SO INTERESTING?

08:12.367 --> 08:15.100
- WHAT,
IS HE STUPID?

08:15.100 --> 08:17.167
- NOBODY'S STUPID,
FRANK.

08:17.167 --> 08:18.667
MICHAEL'S A LITTLE YOUNG
FOR THE CLASS,

08:18.667 --> 08:21.567
AND BESIDES,
GIRLS MATURE FASTER THAN BOYS.

08:21.567 --> 08:24.267
- OH, SO I GUESS
GEOFFREY'S FINE, THEN.

08:24.267 --> 08:26.333
- YEAH. ALL RIGHT.

08:27.967 --> 08:29.800
- STOP IT, FRANK.

08:29.800 --> 08:31.333
RAYMOND'S UPSET.

08:31.333 --> 08:33.900
IT'S OKAY, DEAR.
IT'S JUST PRESCHOOL.

08:33.900 --> 08:35.400
- THAT'S WHAT I TOLD HIM.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.367
AND IF HE HAS TO STAY,
GEOFFREY WILL STAY WITH HIM.

08:37.367 --> 08:40.000
- OH, THAT'S GOOD.
- NO, NO, NO!

08:40.000 --> 08:41.700
- WHY NOT, FRANK?

08:41.700 --> 08:42.733
- LAW OF NATURE.

08:42.733 --> 08:44.667
YOU GET LEFT BEHIND,
YOU GET EATEN.

08:46.100 --> 08:47.800
YOU'RE TOO SOFT
ON THE KIDS.

08:47.800 --> 08:50.767
YOU GOT TO PUSH THEM.
PUSH THEM FORWARD.

08:50.767 --> 08:54.033
JUST KEEP PUSHING THEM!

08:54.033 --> 08:55.800
- UNTIL WHEN, FRANK?

08:55.800 --> 08:57.533
- UNTIL THEY CRY.

08:59.567 --> 09:01.400
THAT'S NATURE'S WAY
OF LETTING YOU KNOW

09:01.400 --> 09:03.467
YOU'VE PUSHED ENOUGH.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.333
- HERE'S A MAN
THEY LET HAVE TWO CHILDREN.

09:12.700 --> 09:15.100
- RAYMOND, DON'T WORRY
ABOUT THE BOYS.

09:15.100 --> 09:17.700
THEY'RE BEAUTIFUL,
SWEET BOYS.

09:17.700 --> 09:20.300
THEY'RE GONNA FLY AWAY
SOON ENOUGH.

09:20.300 --> 09:21.533
- YEAH, ALL RIGHT,
MA, LOOK,

09:21.533 --> 09:24.067
I WANT THEM TO MOVE UP
TO KINDERGARTEN

09:24.067 --> 09:25.367
AND BE WITH THE OTHER CHILDREN.

09:25.367 --> 09:27.433
- OTHER CHILDREN
ARE OVERRATED.

09:29.167 --> 09:32.400
BUT IT WON'T HURT
MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY

09:32.400 --> 09:35.167
TO STAY LITTLE
ONE MORE YEAR.

09:35.167 --> 09:37.500
YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHAT
I DID WITH YOU.

09:41.400 --> 09:42.667
- WHAT?

09:42.667 --> 09:43.667
- IT'S FUNNY.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.800
[laughing]

09:45.800 --> 09:47.167
I NEVER TOLD YOU THIS,

09:47.167 --> 09:49.533
BUT WHEN YOU
WERE THE TWINS' AGE--

09:49.533 --> 09:52.400
DO YOU REMEMBER NURSERY SCHOOL,
USED TO BE ON JAY STREET

09:52.400 --> 09:54.800
WITH THE PRETTY
YELLOW FLOWERS OUT FRONT?

09:54.800 --> 09:57.667
WELL, YOU AND I WOULD
WALK THERE AND BACK TOGETHER

09:57.667 --> 09:58.667
EVERY MORNING.

09:58.667 --> 10:01.500
AND YOU WERE SO CUTE
HOLDING MY HAND.

10:01.500 --> 10:04.100
SO WHEN IT CAME TIME
FOR YOU TO GO TO KINDERGARTEN,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.100
WHICH WAS CROSSTOWN
WITH A BUS,

10:06.100 --> 10:08.367
I DECIDED IT
WOULD BE NICE FOR EVERYBODY

10:08.367 --> 10:11.733
IF YOU STAYED IN PRESCHOOL
ONE MORE YEAR.

10:16.000 --> 10:18.167
- YOU LEFT ME BACK?

10:18.167 --> 10:20.700
- LEFT BACK FOR LOVE.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.600
- THAT, AND YOU WERE SLOW.

10:25.600 --> 10:28.067
I REMEMBER
YOU COULDN'T EVEN CUT PAPER.

10:31.667 --> 10:34.800
- HEE HEE!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.133
- FRANK!
- WAIT.

10:36.133 --> 10:38.233
WHAT?

10:38.233 --> 10:39.300
WHAT WAS WRONG WITH ME?

10:39.300 --> 10:41.033
- NOTHING, SWEETIE.

10:41.033 --> 10:42.700
YOU WERE JUST
A LITTLE YOUNG, TOO.

10:42.700 --> 10:44.600
SO YOU STAYED THERE
ONE MORE YEAR,

10:44.600 --> 10:48.400
AND WE GOT TO WALK
BY THE YELLOW FLOWERS SOME MORE.

10:56.833 --> 11:01.300
- TH-THAT'S WHY I WAS ALWAYS
THE OLDEST IN MY CLASS.

11:01.300 --> 11:03.567
- YELLOW FLOWERS.

11:06.167 --> 11:07.900
- YOU KNEW?
- NO.

11:07.900 --> 11:09.433
- YES, YOU--
OF COURSE YOU DID!

11:09.433 --> 11:11.100
THAT'S WHAT WAS SO INTERESTING.

11:11.100 --> 11:12.600
- OKAY, I KNEW.

11:12.600 --> 11:14.433
- WELL, WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?
- I DON'T KNOW.

11:14.433 --> 11:16.867
- YOU TELL YOUR BROTHER THIS!
- I COULDN'T!

11:16.867 --> 11:18.233
- WHY?
- BECAUSE.

11:18.233 --> 11:21.833
- BECAUSE WHY?
- BECAUSE I FELT SORRY FOR YOU!

11:21.833 --> 11:24.833
- YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME?

11:24.833 --> 11:27.167
YOU FELT SORRY FOR ME?

11:31.800 --> 11:32.800
- RAY, IT WAS JUST
PRE--

11:32.800 --> 11:34.200
- GAH!

11:38.000 --> 11:40.200
- I WAS JUST--
- GAH!

11:43.233 --> 11:45.133
- OH--
- EE--NO!

11:49.500 --> 11:52.733
- MAYBE I SHOULD'VE WAITED
ANOTHER YEAR TO TELL HIM.

12:04.467 --> 12:07.000
- DEB.

12:07.000 --> 12:08.533
DEB.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.533
- OW!

12:21.533 --> 12:22.733
HEY!

12:22.733 --> 12:25.967
- WHAT'S UP?

12:25.967 --> 12:27.867
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:27.867 --> 12:30.067
- AM I STUPID?

12:30.067 --> 12:34.500
- IF THIS IS YOUR NEW WAY
OF ASKING FOR SEX, THEN YES.

12:37.233 --> 12:39.067
- COME ON, DON'T YOU SEE?

12:39.067 --> 12:41.067
THAT'S WHAT I PASSED ON
TO MICHAEL.

12:41.067 --> 12:42.267
THAT'S MY LEGACY.

12:42.267 --> 12:45.233
- NO, NO, NO.
- THE DUMBNESS.

12:45.233 --> 12:48.033
-YOU'VE PASSED ON OTHER THINGS.

12:50.633 --> 12:52.733
YOUR LACK OF TUSHIE.

12:54.933 --> 12:56.667
- HA.
YEAH, VERY FUNNY.

12:56.667 --> 12:58.900
YOU HAVE A STUPID KID,
YOU DON'T EVEN CARE.

12:58.900 --> 13:00.567
- HE IS NOT STUPID.

13:00.567 --> 13:03.533
- THEN WHY ISN'T HE
THE SAME AS GEOFFREY?

13:03.533 --> 13:06.767
YOU CAN'T EVEN GET GOOD TWINS
ANYMORE.

13:06.767 --> 13:09.533
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU
THINK OF IT THIS WAY, OKAY?

13:09.533 --> 13:12.267
MICHAEL IS THE WAY
THE TWINS SHOULD BE,

13:12.267 --> 13:16.100
AND GEOFFREY IS EXCEPTIONAL.

13:16.100 --> 13:19.367
- GEOFFREY'S YOUR FAVORITE.

13:19.367 --> 13:21.033
- YOU'RE KIDDING NOW, RIGHT?
- ADMIT IT.

13:21.033 --> 13:22.733
YOU'VE ALWAYS LIKED
GEOFFREY BETTER,

13:22.733 --> 13:26.867
AND THAT'S WHY
MICHAEL'S GOOFY.

13:26.867 --> 13:28.633
- GOOD NIGHT.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.667
MAYBE IF YOU WERE AROUND
A LITTLE MORE,

13:32.667 --> 13:35.767
MICHAEL COULD CUT PAPER.

13:35.767 --> 13:37.633
- AHA!

13:37.633 --> 13:40.500
I KNEW IT WAS RIGHT THERE
UNDER THE SURFACE, RIGHT.

13:40.500 --> 13:43.100
SO I SHOULD GO TO WORK
AND RAISE THE KIDS, ALL RIGHT.

13:43.100 --> 13:44.333
IT SHOULD BE ALL ME.

13:44.333 --> 13:45.800
YEAH,
AND WHAT DO YOU DO ALL DAY--

13:45.800 --> 13:47.367
I'M SORRY.

13:54.600 --> 13:56.433
- EXCUSE ME?
- I'M SORRY.

13:56.433 --> 13:57.600
- THAT'S RIGHT, YOU'RE SORRY.

13:57.600 --> 13:59.000
- THAT'S RIGHT, I'M SORRY!

13:59.000 --> 14:00.800
- YEAH.

14:00.800 --> 14:02.700
- I--LOOK, I JUST--

14:02.700 --> 14:06.233
I WANT THE KIDS
TO BE JUST LIKE EVERYBODY ELSE.

14:06.233 --> 14:08.267
- THEY ARE.
- NO.

14:08.267 --> 14:10.333
NO, THEY SHOULD--
THEY SHOULD MOVE UP

14:10.333 --> 14:12.567
AND GO TO KINDERGARTEN
AND BE WITH THEIR FRIENDS

14:12.567 --> 14:17.200
AND KEEP UP
WITH THE BOARD-LICKERS.

14:17.200 --> 14:19.433
AND HOW ABOUT THIS?
WHAT--WHAT IF--

14:19.433 --> 14:20.900
WHAT IF ONE DAY GEOFFREY
FINDS OUT

14:20.900 --> 14:22.200
THAT HE'S THE SMARTER ONE?

14:22.200 --> 14:23.933
HE'LL NEVER LET MICHAEL
LIVE IT DOWN.

14:23.933 --> 14:25.333
HE'LL GLOAT.

14:25.333 --> 14:27.633
JUST LIKE ROBERT'S
GONNA DO TO ME NOW.

14:27.633 --> 14:28.900
HE'S GONNA GLOAT.

14:28.900 --> 14:31.767
HE'S GONNA GLOAT
ALL OVER ME.

14:31.767 --> 14:33.800
- RAY, IT'S PRESCHOOL,

14:33.800 --> 14:35.533
AND IF THEY HAVE TO STAY BEHIND,

14:35.533 --> 14:38.900
IT'LL BE BECAUSE THAT'S
WHAT'S BEST FOR THEM, RIGHT?

14:38.900 --> 14:42.467
ISN'T THE MOST IMPORTANT THING
THAT THEY'RE HEALTHY AND HAPPY?

14:44.433 --> 14:47.567
- YOU DON'T CARE ABOUT
EITHER ONE OF THEM, DO YOU?

14:51.367 --> 14:53.700
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD NEWS!

14:53.700 --> 14:56.100
I WENT DOWN TO THAT SCHOOL
AND HAD A LITTLE VISIT

14:56.100 --> 14:59.667
WITH THE KINDERGARTEN BROAD.

14:59.667 --> 15:00.600
- WHAT?

15:00.600 --> 15:04.367
- THAT'S RIGHT,
I SCHMOOZED HER.

15:04.367 --> 15:06.733
HEY, SHE'S A HUMAN BEING.

15:06.733 --> 15:08.567
AND A WOMAN.

15:08.567 --> 15:09.867
- OH, NO.

15:09.867 --> 15:12.733
- AND BEING A WOMAN,
SHE'S A SUCKER FOR THE OLD

15:12.733 --> 15:14.767
"LOOK HOW MANY PHOTOS
OF THE CHILDREN

15:14.767 --> 15:17.067
GRANDPA HAS IN HIS WALLET" BIT.

15:17.067 --> 15:20.967
[in a high-pitched voice]
"OH, LOOK! THEY'RE SO ADORABLE!

15:20.967 --> 15:23.467
"AND WHAT A CHARMING GRANDPA!

15:23.467 --> 15:27.567
AND WHAT A DISTINGUISHED-LOOKING
FOREHEAD!"

15:27.567 --> 15:28.867
- SHE SAID THAT?

15:28.867 --> 15:31.367
- I PARAPHRASE.

15:31.367 --> 15:33.100
ANYWAY, THE REAL REASON
FOR THE BIT IS

15:33.100 --> 15:36.800
TO ACCIDENTALLY ALLOW A PEEK AT
THE WALLET BEING EXTRA FULL.

15:36.800 --> 15:39.800
- OH, GOD.
- OH, NO.

15:39.800 --> 15:42.400
- [chuckles]

15:42.400 --> 15:44.967
- NOW, SHE DIDN'T GIVE ME
A DEFINITE ANSWER ABOUT MIKEY,

15:44.967 --> 15:47.133
BUT I SAW HER EYES LIGHT UP.

15:47.133 --> 15:49.467
YOU KNOW, THOSE TEACHERS
DON'T MAKE SQUAT.

15:49.467 --> 15:51.500
[chucking]

15:54.567 --> 15:57.633
- I DON'T--I ALWAYS TOLD YOU
WE SHOULD HAVE A TRAPDOOR

15:57.633 --> 15:59.533
RIGHT THERE.

16:04.200 --> 16:06.367
- WHAT, NOW YOU'RE MAD?

16:06.367 --> 16:08.167
I DON'T GET YOU TWO.

16:08.167 --> 16:10.333
I'M THINKING OF THE KID!

16:10.333 --> 16:13.467
YOU KNOW, WE THOUGHT THAT
LEAVING LITTLE RAYMOND BACK

16:13.467 --> 16:17.433
DIDN'T HURT HIM ANY,
BUT WHO THE CRAP KNOWS?

16:17.433 --> 16:20.600
YOU COULD'VE BEEN A YEAR
AHEAD IN YOUR LIFE RIGHT NOW.

16:20.600 --> 16:22.133
THAT CAR YOU'RE SAVING UP FOR?

16:22.133 --> 16:24.667
YOU COULD BE DRIVING THAT TODAY.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.600
YOU COULD'VE BOUGHT THE HOUSE
A YEAR SOONER,

16:28.600 --> 16:30.733
MET DEBRA A YEAR SOONER,

16:30.733 --> 16:32.833
HAD THE KIDS A YEAR SOONER,

16:32.833 --> 16:34.500
WHICH, IF YOU DID, BY THE WAY,

16:34.500 --> 16:36.467
WOULD PUT MICHAEL
RIGHT ON TRACK,

16:36.467 --> 16:39.733
AND WE WOULDN'T HAVE TO HAVE
THIS CONVERSATION!

16:42.033 --> 16:43.767
- ALL RIGHT,
JUST HOLD IT, FRANK.

16:43.767 --> 16:45.333
DO YOU WANT TO HELP THE KIDS?

16:45.333 --> 16:48.767
WHY DON'T YOU START BY SETTING
A DECENT MORAL EXAMPLE?

16:48.767 --> 16:51.600
NONE OF THIS MATTERS!
DO YOU UNDERSTAND?

16:51.600 --> 16:52.800
THEY ARE FOUR.

16:52.800 --> 16:56.367
WE JUST WANT THEM
TO BE HEALTHY AND HAPPY!

16:59.700 --> 17:02.267
- GOOD LUCK ON THAT ONE.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.800
- THAT'S WHERE YOU GET IT FROM.

17:05.800 --> 17:08.733
- THAT'S GREAT,
I'M GONNA BE STUPID AND BALD.

17:13.600 --> 17:16.700
- HEY, CHUCKLEHEADS,
LET'S GO, MAKE THE BEDS!

17:16.700 --> 17:19.567
COME ON, ISN'T TODAY
THE BIG WINTER CONCERT GIG?

17:19.567 --> 17:20.500
- YEAH.
- YEAH.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.300
- YEAH, YOU'RE EXCITED, RIGHT?

17:22.300 --> 17:25.867
SO LET'S MOVE LIKE
LITTLE EXCITED PEOPLE.

17:25.867 --> 17:27.367
- RAY?

17:27.367 --> 17:29.367
- WHAT?
- COME HERE.

17:31.667 --> 17:34.067
I GOT THE CALL
FROM THE PRINCIPAL.

17:34.067 --> 17:35.467
- WHAT, ABOUT THEM?

17:35.467 --> 17:36.933
- YEAH.

17:36.933 --> 17:38.167
THEY THINK THAT MICHAEL

17:38.167 --> 17:41.733
SHOULD STAY IN PRESCHOOL
ANOTHER YEAR.

17:41.733 --> 17:43.433
- OH...

17:46.033 --> 17:48.600
SO THEN GEOFFREY, TOO?

17:48.600 --> 17:49.600
- MM.

17:49.600 --> 17:51.967
- YEAH.

17:51.967 --> 17:53.500
- [sighs]

17:53.500 --> 17:55.300
- SO THEN...

17:55.300 --> 17:56.400
THAT'S OKAY, RIGHT?

17:56.400 --> 17:58.900
I MEAN, THAT'S WHAT WE SAID,

17:58.900 --> 18:02.033
HAPPY AND HEALTHY.

18:02.033 --> 18:05.033
WE STILL WANT THAT?

18:05.033 --> 18:06.033
- YEAH.

18:06.033 --> 18:08.633
- UM.
- YEAH.

18:08.633 --> 18:09.633
- YOU OKAY?

18:09.633 --> 18:10.633
- YEAH.

18:10.633 --> 18:12.300
I JUST THOUGHT YOU'D BE UPSET.

18:12.300 --> 18:15.633
- NO, I'M, YOU KNOW,
I'M--I'M GOOD.

18:15.633 --> 18:16.433
- GOOD.
- YEAH.

18:16.433 --> 18:17.533
- YEAH, THEY'LL BE FINE.

18:17.533 --> 18:19.300
- YEAH, THEY'LL BE TOGETHER.

18:19.300 --> 18:22.633
- YEAH, NO, IT'S--IT'S GOOD.
IT'S GOOD.

18:24.933 --> 18:26.867
OKAY.

18:26.867 --> 18:28.167
ALL RIGHT, YOU GUYS, COME ON,

18:28.167 --> 18:30.167
YOU'RE THE BIG COMEDY STARS
TODAY.

18:30.167 --> 18:32.167
- LOOK, DADDY,
I MADE MY BED.

18:32.167 --> 18:35.500
- YEAH, GEOFFREY,
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.

18:47.433 --> 18:51.133
MIKEY, YOU'RE DOING IT THERE.

18:51.133 --> 18:52.600
GOOD.

18:54.767 --> 18:57.133
HEY, MIKE.

18:57.133 --> 18:59.233
COME HERE.

18:59.233 --> 19:00.867

19:09.767 --> 19:14.767
H-HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO STAY
IN HER CLASS NEXT YEAR?

19:14.767 --> 19:15.767
- OKAY.

19:15.767 --> 19:16.800
- YEAH?
GOOD.

19:16.800 --> 19:18.033
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

19:18.033 --> 19:20.867
IF YOU WANT TO, YOU CAN, OKAY?

19:20.867 --> 19:23.100
- OKAY.
- GOOD.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.800
GOOD.

19:26.800 --> 19:29.500
- DO I HAVE TO CUT PAPER NOW?

19:30.767 --> 19:33.333
- NO.
NO.

19:34.867 --> 19:37.100
NO.

19:37.100 --> 19:39.000
UNLESS YOU WANT TO.

19:39.000 --> 19:40.033
- NO.

19:40.033 --> 19:42.500
LOOK, I HAVE PANTS LIKE DADDY.

19:42.500 --> 19:43.867
- HM.

19:43.867 --> 19:47.567
YEAH, HOW ABOUT THAT?

19:47.567 --> 19:49.633
JUST LIKE DADDY.

19:52.867 --> 19:54.400
COME HERE.

20:00.133 --> 20:02.100

JINGLE BELLS, JINGLE BELLS

20:02.100 --> 20:04.133
JINGLE ALL THE WAY

20:04.133 --> 20:06.467
OH, WHAT FUN IT IS TO RIDE

20:06.467 --> 20:10.800
IN A ONE-HORSE OPEN SLEIGH

20:10.800 --> 20:13.733
[applause]

20:20.667 --> 20:21.700
- THANKS, EVERYBODY.

20:21.700 --> 20:23.233
AND NOW FOR
A VERY SPECIAL TREAT:

20:23.233 --> 20:27.033
THE COMEDY TEAM
OF MICHAEL AND GEOFFREY BARONE!

20:27.033 --> 20:30.167
[applause]

20:33.600 --> 20:37.733
- HELLO, MICHAEL,
I JUST FLEW IN FROM CLEVELAND.

20:39.433 --> 20:41.633
- AND YOUR ARMS ARE VERY TIRED!

20:41.633 --> 20:44.567
[laughter and applause]

20:47.567 --> 20:51.500
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN SWIMMING
SINCE I WAS THREE.

20:55.333 --> 20:58.167
- AND YOUR ARMS ARE VERY TIRED.

20:58.167 --> 21:01.300
[laughter and applause]

21:09.200 --> 21:11.533
IF YOU'RE AMERICAN
IN THE LIVING ROOM,

21:11.533 --> 21:14.133
WHAT ARE YOU
IN THE BATHROOM?

21:17.100 --> 21:18.767
- YOU'RE A-PEEIN'!

21:18.767 --> 21:21.700
[laughter and applause]

21:26.633 --> 21:29.100
- THAT ONE WAS MINE.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.100
- HEY.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

21:40.100 --> 21:41.567
- YEAH, WELL, YOU KNOW,
I GOT THAT GARDEN

21:41.567 --> 21:43.867
GROWING ON MY TERRACE
OVER MY APARTMENT,

21:43.867 --> 21:46.433
AND I THOUGHT I'D BRING YOU GUYS
SOME PLANTS.

21:46.433 --> 21:47.967
- REALLY?
ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
