WEBVTT

00:09.232 --> 00:10.865
Josh, Lucy.

00:10.968 --> 00:12.726
- Hi, Tom.
- Hi!

00:12.751 --> 00:14.513
Well... this is a surprise.

00:14.545 --> 00:17.612
What in Sam Heck are you kids
doing all the way out here?

00:17.714 --> 00:21.632
Well, uh, we have a
bit of breaking news.

00:21.657 --> 00:23.282
- News?
- We're getting married.

00:23.307 --> 00:25.387
- Yeah.
- You guys!

00:28.115 --> 00:30.849
You know your mother's been
hoping for this for a long time,

00:30.874 --> 00:32.908
so when she gets the news,

00:33.010 --> 00:35.644
we might be in for a bit of a reaction.

00:35.746 --> 00:38.046
Yeah, God. Yeah, that's a good point.

00:38.148 --> 00:41.283
Uh, maybe we should
take some precautions.

00:41.385 --> 00:42.417
Yeah.

00:44.321 --> 00:47.389
Glad you called. That mom
looks highly excitable.

00:47.491 --> 00:49.124
When she finds out
you're getting married,

00:49.226 --> 00:50.319
she's gonna explode.

00:50.382 --> 00:52.294
- Are we in danger?
- Well, it depends.

00:52.396 --> 00:55.230
This mom... does she
particularly like weddings?

00:55.332 --> 00:57.799
I-I would go so far as to say

00:57.901 --> 01:00.235
she maybe loves weddings.

01:00.337 --> 01:02.003
All right.

01:02.105 --> 01:05.840
This mom... when she looks at
you, does she see a full-grown man?

01:05.943 --> 01:09.010
Or does she still see her tiny,
little, itty-bitty baby boy?

01:09.112 --> 01:10.804
Uh...

01:12.382 --> 01:14.082
probably the second one.

01:14.184 --> 01:16.585
- Which one did I say second?
- Itty... itty-bitty baby boy.

01:16.687 --> 01:18.787
Crap. This is gonna get hairy,

01:18.889 --> 01:20.188
but we'll get through it.

01:20.290 --> 01:22.123
Thanks for your help,
mister... Greenberg.

01:22.225 --> 01:23.658
Greenberg.

01:23.760 --> 01:26.261
Son, what's this mom's religion?

01:26.363 --> 01:28.163
- She's Jewish.
- Back it up, people!

01:28.265 --> 01:30.131
Back it up! Let's go!

01:30.233 --> 01:31.833
Go, go! Move, move!

01:32.037 --> 01:33.837
It's not worth it! Get out of here!

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:49.052 --> 01:51.653
Well, hello!

01:51.755 --> 01:53.288
Is this for me?

02:00.897 --> 02:03.632
Josh is getting married?

02:04.935 --> 02:05.900
Take cover!

02:10.907 --> 02:14.976
Well, this is just great news.

02:19.082 --> 02:20.382
Ah!

02:44.874 --> 02:47.786
Congratulations on the wonderful news.

02:47.811 --> 02:49.711
We are both so happy for you.

02:49.813 --> 02:51.446
Our Liz Greenberg,

02:51.548 --> 02:54.753
officially a partner at
Hayes, Weber, and Rudnisky.

02:54.778 --> 02:58.083
Thank you very much. I
appreciate this opportunity,

02:58.108 --> 03:01.309
and I will do my utmost
to make this firm proud.

03:06.897 --> 03:08.063
Yes!

03:10.450 --> 03:12.383
Yeah!

03:12.669 --> 03:14.048
I did it.

03:14.935 --> 03:17.112
Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes!

03:17.137 --> 03:18.604
Yes!

03:20.343 --> 03:22.877
- Hey, Liz.
- Good morning.

03:22.979 --> 03:25.380
Mom?

03:30.887 --> 03:33.621
Hello? Is anyone home?

03:33.724 --> 03:35.123
Looking for your mom and dad?

03:35.225 --> 03:37.058
Uh, my stepdad. Yes.

03:37.160 --> 03:38.927
I think they're out back.

03:39.029 --> 03:40.395
- There you are.
- Oh, hey.

03:40.497 --> 03:41.651
Hey.

03:41.676 --> 03:44.342
- I've got some big news.
- Oh, we've already heard.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.009
Josh is getting married.

03:46.034 --> 03:47.533
Oh, I know. I know, it's great.

03:47.558 --> 03:49.548
I-I have some other big news.

03:49.573 --> 03:51.137
- Ah, yeah?
- Where are you guys going?

03:51.162 --> 03:53.742
Oh, your mother and I have decided

03:53.844 --> 03:55.110
to drop out of society,

03:55.212 --> 03:58.146
and follow Josh's wedding full-time.

03:58.248 --> 03:59.147
Yeah.

03:59.249 --> 04:01.015
Full... full-time?

04:07.190 --> 04:09.023
- So check it out.
- Okay.

04:09.126 --> 04:12.794
We're gonna hit them at
the stationary store today.

04:12.896 --> 04:13.566
Okay.

04:13.591 --> 04:15.497
Definitely at the dress-fitting.

04:15.599 --> 04:18.333
- Mm-hmm.
- And if we drive all night...

04:18.435 --> 04:20.196
We are gonna make it

04:20.221 --> 04:22.303
to the cake tasting.

04:22.405 --> 04:24.839
Man, I could go for some cake right now.

04:27.110 --> 04:30.011
Wait, cakes... Okay,
are... are you guys high?

04:30.113 --> 04:32.021
Wow, cool... cool instrument.

04:32.046 --> 04:37.016
I just wanted... had some
really cool news at work today.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.950
- I made partner!
- Whoa... bad...

04:43.093 --> 04:45.360
Okay, here's the deal, Liz.

04:45.462 --> 04:47.695
I know that you're into
this whole partner trip,

04:47.798 --> 04:49.564
and... and that's cool,

04:49.666 --> 04:51.366
but it's harshing our mellow.

04:54.237 --> 04:56.738
- Tom!
- Everything's still groovy.

04:56.840 --> 04:59.307
We're here at the stationary store, man.

04:59.409 --> 05:01.075
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:01.178 --> 05:03.178
- Whoo!
- Whoo-hoo-hoo!

05:03.280 --> 05:04.532
Okay, so which one do you like better?

05:04.557 --> 05:06.106
- Eggshell or off-white?
- Uh, which one is which?

05:06.131 --> 05:07.348
The lighter one is eggshell.

05:07.450 --> 05:08.483
- This one?
- Yeah.

05:08.585 --> 05:10.608
- Whoo!
- Whoo! Invitations!

05:13.256 --> 05:15.190
- Eggshell!
- Eggshell!

05:15.292 --> 05:17.992
Whoa, you got a really cool mom and dad.

05:18.094 --> 05:20.195
Stepdad.

05:20.297 --> 05:21.763
He's my stepdad.

05:43.320 --> 05:44.706
This is Joel.

05:45.989 --> 05:47.294
Hello?

05:48.525 --> 05:50.058
Hi... hi, Dad.

05:56.046 --> 05:57.378
Your assistant said you were so busy,

05:57.481 --> 05:58.768
so thank you for squeezing me in.

05:58.793 --> 06:01.284
Oh, it's no problem. A client cancelled.

06:02.319 --> 06:03.456
Lucky me.

06:04.721 --> 06:06.854
So, uh, are you still
clerking for that judge?

06:07.031 --> 06:09.459
No, I left that job over five years ago.

06:09.593 --> 06:11.159
Oh, that's right.

06:11.261 --> 06:13.995
I'm actually over at Hayes,
Weber, and Rudnisky now.

06:14.051 --> 06:15.250
Good firm. I hear they're pretty rough

06:15.352 --> 06:17.319
on their associates over there.

06:17.421 --> 06:18.754
Well, I don't have to worry about that

06:18.856 --> 06:20.289
now that I'm a partner.

06:20.391 --> 06:22.858
Hold on.

06:22.960 --> 06:24.583
You're a partner? Holy...

06:25.729 --> 06:26.695
What are you? The youngest partner

06:26.797 --> 06:28.330
in the history of that firm?

06:28.432 --> 06:29.655
Guilty.

06:29.680 --> 06:31.343
How old are you? 32?

06:31.368 --> 06:32.801
I just turned 31.

06:32.903 --> 06:35.003
You know, I was exactly your age

06:35.106 --> 06:36.472
when I made partner.

06:36.574 --> 06:38.574
I knew that actually.

06:44.048 --> 06:46.048
To the new partner.

06:56.460 --> 06:57.993
What was that?

06:58.095 --> 07:00.996
- Nothing.
- No, you made a face.

07:01.098 --> 07:02.865
- Is the wine bad?
- No, no, it's fine.

07:02.967 --> 07:04.166
Don't lie.

07:04.268 --> 07:07.169
- Okay, it's not great.
- Further.

07:07.271 --> 07:08.804
What do you mean? It's not good?

07:08.906 --> 07:11.006
Say what's on your mind. You know it.

07:11.108 --> 07:12.508
Say the words.

07:12.610 --> 07:14.510
It sucks.

07:14.612 --> 07:16.345
This wine sucks.

07:16.447 --> 07:18.080
How did you do that?

07:18.182 --> 07:21.216
How did you know this wine sucked?

07:21.318 --> 07:24.419
I don't know, I-I tasted
it, and it came to me?

07:24.522 --> 07:26.054
Come with me.

07:28.659 --> 07:30.058
I was born with a gift,

07:30.161 --> 07:31.527
a gift I thought would die with me,

07:31.629 --> 07:33.362
but it lives on.

07:33.464 --> 07:35.063
You inherited it.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.666
A gift? What gift?

07:37.691 --> 07:39.027
You have the incredible ability

07:39.052 --> 07:41.503
to tell what's good and what sucks.

07:41.528 --> 07:42.604
I don't know what you're talking about.

07:42.706 --> 07:44.873
I'm just normal. I'm a...

07:44.975 --> 07:46.608
I'm a normal, simple woman.

07:46.710 --> 07:49.244
Patti's normal, Josh is normal,

07:49.346 --> 07:51.613
Tom...

07:51.715 --> 07:53.916
I don't know what Tom is.

07:54.018 --> 07:57.586
But you... you have a special sight.

07:57.688 --> 08:01.056
Here, what do you think
of this public art?

08:01.158 --> 08:04.193
I don't know, it's just art.

08:04.295 --> 08:06.061
Focus, Liz, focus.

08:20.010 --> 08:21.276
It sucks.

08:24.248 --> 08:25.612
Concentrate.

08:25.637 --> 08:28.371
Is it good? Or does it suck?

08:33.991 --> 08:37.793
Good. This is a good tie.

08:37.895 --> 08:39.995
This is a good tie.

08:40.097 --> 08:41.847
Learn to harness the power.

08:48.087 --> 08:49.553
Sucks.

08:49.616 --> 08:53.152
And most importantly, do
not be afraid to unleash it.

08:56.247 --> 08:58.981
That sucks.

08:59.083 --> 09:00.983
This sucks.

09:01.085 --> 09:03.485
Sucks. Sucks!

09:03.587 --> 09:06.288
This whole neighborhood sucks!

09:09.026 --> 09:11.293
Yes, it does.

09:11.395 --> 09:13.662
It sucks.

09:13.764 --> 09:15.931
You are very special, Liz.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.766
If only Mom and Tom felt that way.

09:17.791 --> 09:22.093
Well, Mom and Tom are like blind worms,

09:22.273 --> 09:23.772
snaking their way through the muck,

09:23.874 --> 09:25.941
bellies dragging in the filth.

09:26.043 --> 09:27.876
Yeah. It's really annoying

09:27.978 --> 09:29.511
how focused they are on Josh's wedding.

09:29.613 --> 09:31.179
That's just like Patti, focusing on

09:31.282 --> 09:34.549
insignificant things,
like marriage and weddings.

09:34.652 --> 09:37.152
I am so glad I got out of there.

09:37.254 --> 09:40.122
- Do you ever regret leaving?
- The only thing I regret

09:40.224 --> 09:41.857
is what I had to leave behind.

09:41.959 --> 09:44.126
You mean me?

09:44.228 --> 09:46.795
Sure. Sure.

09:46.897 --> 09:48.088
But I also left behind

09:48.113 --> 09:49.975
a rare Jean Burdette print at the house.

09:50.000 --> 09:51.447
- Oh.
- And God knows

09:51.472 --> 09:52.664
its worth is lost on Patti.

09:52.689 --> 09:55.281
Her idea of art is those
tacky blankets she knits.

09:55.306 --> 09:58.453
- The ones with the dolphins?
- Mm, yes.

09:58.478 --> 09:59.242
Ugh.

09:59.267 --> 10:00.842
- They suck.
- They suck.

10:00.944 --> 10:03.545
Mom sends me one every year.

10:03.647 --> 10:05.380
A dolphin blanket every year?

10:05.482 --> 10:06.748
Christ, what do you do with all of them?

10:06.850 --> 10:08.383
I shove 'em in the back of the closet.

10:08.485 --> 10:10.018
I'd burn them.

10:10.120 --> 10:12.321
Shit. Listen, I gotta run.

10:12.423 --> 10:14.890
- It's a work thing.
- Oh, no.

10:14.992 --> 10:17.426
You know, I could get
your print back for you.

10:17.528 --> 10:20.028
- Really?
- Yeah, I could go now.

10:20.130 --> 10:22.030
And, uh, we could meet
up in a couple of hours.

10:22.132 --> 10:25.200
Maybe we could get a late
dinner maybe at your club?

10:25.302 --> 10:26.501
Yeah.

10:26.603 --> 10:27.936
- Yeah, I would love that.
- Great.

10:28.038 --> 10:29.037
Mm.

10:34.211 --> 10:37.546
The super juicer comes with
three removable attachments,

10:37.648 --> 10:40.082
all of which are
completely dishwasher safe.

10:40.184 --> 10:42.017
Oh, hey, Liz.

10:42.119 --> 10:43.489
I'd get up and give you a hug,

10:43.514 --> 10:46.332
but I'm as snug as a
dolphin in a blanket.

10:46.357 --> 10:47.989
As they say.

10:50.561 --> 10:52.627
Oh, Liz, we need help

10:52.730 --> 10:55.297
with the napkin folds
for Josh's wedding.

10:55.399 --> 10:56.932
Now which do you prefer?

10:57.034 --> 11:00.535
The French fold, or the...

11:00.637 --> 11:02.204
Bishop's hat?

11:02.306 --> 11:04.473
They both suck.

11:04.575 --> 11:05.741
Liz!

11:08.912 --> 11:10.312
What are you doing?

11:10.414 --> 11:13.615
Oh, I'm, uh, getting Dad's print.

11:13.717 --> 11:15.005
You saw Joel?

11:15.030 --> 11:17.697
Yeah, I did, and we
had a lot of fun, Mom,

11:17.988 --> 11:20.756
'cause he appreciates
things like cool art,

11:20.858 --> 11:24.493
and having a daughter who made
partner at a major law firm.

11:24.518 --> 11:29.341
Elizabeth, we're very proud
that you get to be manager.

11:29.366 --> 11:30.932
I'm not manager!

11:31.034 --> 11:33.301
I made partner.

11:33.404 --> 11:35.524
I don't work at Foot Locker.

11:35.635 --> 11:37.483
Hey, here's an idea.

11:37.508 --> 11:39.908
Um, why don't we all
go out and celebrate?

11:40.010 --> 11:42.444
We'll go to Pasta Buongiorno.

11:42.546 --> 11:44.446
Liz, they take your picture,

11:44.548 --> 11:48.350
and you get to be the meatballs!

11:48.452 --> 11:49.851
I've got better plans.

11:49.953 --> 11:51.853
Better than Pasta Buongiorno?

11:53.724 --> 11:56.057
But you get to be the meatballs.

12:01.098 --> 12:03.498
Excuse me, miss, are you a member?

12:03.600 --> 12:05.217
My dad is. We're having dinner.

12:05.242 --> 12:07.109
He needs to be present to escort you in.

12:11.975 --> 12:13.608
Okay, sure.

12:19.983 --> 12:21.983
- Joel Greenberg's office.
- Yeah, this is Liz.

12:22.085 --> 12:24.820
Is my dad on his way?
We have dinner plans.

12:24.922 --> 12:27.956
Right. Joel is gonna have to cancel.

12:28.058 --> 12:30.659
- Oh.
- Something came up.

12:30.761 --> 12:33.795
Uh, maybe we can just
reschedule for next week then.

12:33.897 --> 12:36.131
- Yeah, next week's no good.
- Of course.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.199
But he did leave a message for you.

12:37.301 --> 12:39.134
One sec.

12:39.236 --> 12:41.636
He said if you brought
his Jean Burdette print,

12:41.738 --> 12:44.239
to leave it at the club reception.

12:44.341 --> 12:46.241
I'll tell him you called?

12:48.822 --> 12:50.412
Uh...

12:50.514 --> 12:52.514
Yeah, don't... don't bother.

13:25.003 --> 13:28.838
Hi, Mom. Hey, Tom.

13:28.940 --> 13:32.842
I brought you a new print to
replace the one that I took.

13:32.944 --> 13:35.779
It's okay, Liz, you can keep it.

13:35.881 --> 13:39.182
It's like you said. We
don't understand art.

13:39.284 --> 13:42.248
Yeah, we're not fancy
like your dad, so...

13:44.122 --> 13:47.424
Uh, look, I just...
I just want to, um...

13:47.526 --> 13:51.828
I just want to apologize. I
was... I was so rude to you.

13:51.930 --> 13:55.098
You did kinda hurt our feelings.

13:55.200 --> 13:57.333
I know.

13:57.436 --> 13:59.703
Hey, what do you say we
go out to dinner, huh?

13:59.805 --> 14:00.528
My treat.

14:00.553 --> 14:02.587
- Oh, you don't have to do that.
- Oh, no, you don't have to do that, please.

14:02.612 --> 14:04.374
- Please?
- No.

14:04.476 --> 14:07.911
I mean, we could go to Pasta Buongiorno.

14:09.548 --> 14:10.542
I've never been.

14:10.566 --> 14:12.049
- What?
- What?

14:12.050 --> 14:14.692
Pasta Buongiorno? Are you kidding?

14:14.717 --> 14:15.529
No, never been.

14:15.554 --> 14:17.287
Can I have a word with your stomach?

14:17.389 --> 14:18.657
You're in for a treat!

14:18.682 --> 14:20.567
- Pasta Buongiorno!
- You're in for a treat!

14:20.592 --> 14:22.639
Pasta Buongiorno!

14:23.391 --> 14:27.363
This place is the tops.
They make everything fun.

14:27.466 --> 14:30.500
Buongiorno, and welcome
to Pasta Buongiorno.

14:30.602 --> 14:32.869
The only thing hotter than our deals

14:32.971 --> 14:34.304
is our pasta.

14:34.406 --> 14:35.909
Can I get you all anything to start?

14:35.934 --> 14:39.869
Well, we're thinking a
buttered bread bonanza.

14:39.894 --> 14:41.599
Ooh, what is that?

14:41.624 --> 14:43.924
- Tell her all about it.
- We take some bread,

14:43.949 --> 14:45.882
butter it, and keep
serving it in baskets

14:45.984 --> 14:48.184
- until you tell us to stop.
- We'll take one.

14:48.286 --> 14:51.488
And are you still doing
the unlimited sauce tub?

14:51.590 --> 14:52.891
- Yeah.
- What is that?

14:52.916 --> 14:54.217
Tell her all about it.

14:54.242 --> 14:55.836
We serve a mixture of our marinara,

14:55.861 --> 14:57.494
pesto, and alfredo sauces

14:57.519 --> 15:00.407
in one of our collectible
Pastas Buongiorno tubs.

15:00.432 --> 15:04.033
You can take the tub home
with you for five bucks extra.

15:04.136 --> 15:06.503
- I think we gotta get two.
- Well, all right.

15:06.528 --> 15:07.514
All right, we're definitely

15:07.539 --> 15:09.783
gonna be having some wine,
'cause it's not every day

15:09.808 --> 15:12.609
we get Liz down to Pasta Buongiorno.

15:12.711 --> 15:14.744
- So maybe...
- Oh, Liz probably knows

15:14.846 --> 15:17.180
a lot more about wines than we do.

15:17.282 --> 15:20.184
- Sweetie, do you wanna pick?
- You're the regulars.

15:20.209 --> 15:21.720
I just want what you guys would get.

15:21.745 --> 15:23.553
Okay, well, we'll have this one.

15:23.655 --> 15:25.922
- It's our favorite.
- Now how do you say it again?

15:26.024 --> 15:27.482
Yak piss.

15:28.678 --> 15:32.546
Oh, wait, is it ya...
uh, yak... yakpizá?

15:32.798 --> 15:35.431
- What it... what... what is it?
- Tell her all about it!

15:35.534 --> 15:36.966
Gus! Table 14.

15:42.295 --> 15:43.638
So the yak drinks water.

15:43.663 --> 15:46.039
That water is then
transported into his stomach,

15:46.064 --> 15:48.197
where his body processes it into waste.

15:48.222 --> 15:50.868
The liquid waste then comes
out of the yak's penis hole

15:50.893 --> 15:52.081
in the form of urine,

15:52.184 --> 15:54.050
and we ladle it out into your glass.

15:54.075 --> 15:56.129
Just like in Italy.

15:56.855 --> 15:59.289
Just...

15:59.391 --> 16:00.290
Mmm.

16:00.315 --> 16:01.314
May I?

16:07.666 --> 16:09.566
Did I pick the wrong kind?

16:14.231 --> 16:15.458
It's fine.

16:15.483 --> 16:18.550
We're gonna get a whole
bucket of that yak piss.

16:19.031 --> 16:20.297
To Josh's wedding.

16:20.322 --> 16:23.089
No, to Liz,

16:23.448 --> 16:26.149
for making partner.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.166
Did I say that right?

16:28.243 --> 16:29.639
You got it, Mom.

16:30.555 --> 16:32.989
Cheers.

16:33.091 --> 16:34.824
Warm tonight.

16:34.926 --> 16:36.926
- It is, it's lovely.
- So warm.

16:37.028 --> 16:38.962
A grainy kinda...

16:39.265 --> 16:41.061
- Yes, a little...
- You feeling that grain? That grit?

16:41.086 --> 16:43.024
- Yes, there is a grit to it.
- Yeah.

16:43.049 --> 16:45.009
Mmm.

16:47.572 --> 16:48.705
See ya.

16:51.951 --> 16:55.979
Hope you enjoyed your
Pasta Buongiorno experience.

16:56.335 --> 16:59.182
You seem to really get
along with your mom and dad.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.184
Well, he's my step, uh...

17:04.746 --> 17:06.826
Yeah, they're really great.

17:09.226 --> 17:11.281
Ooh.

17:11.673 --> 17:13.573
Yeah, I think those
doilies are great, Mom.

17:13.675 --> 17:15.723
Aw, you really think so, Liz?

17:15.749 --> 17:17.911
Yeah, Josh and Lucy will love 'em.

17:18.012 --> 17:19.378
Oh, I-I gotta run.

17:19.481 --> 17:20.826
I'll talk to you later, okay?

17:20.851 --> 17:23.271
Love you very much. Bye.

17:23.670 --> 17:25.385
Good afternoon, Liz.

17:25.487 --> 17:28.255
As you know, you've ingested
a large quantity of yak urine.

17:28.357 --> 17:31.258
- Am I gonna be all right?
- I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.760
That yak you drank from
was clearly mistreated.

17:33.862 --> 17:34.886
And he opened you up

17:34.911 --> 17:36.897
to a whole host of problems.

17:37.137 --> 17:39.276
Are you familiar with a tapeworm?

17:39.301 --> 17:41.148
Mm-hmm. Yeah, my dog... yep.

17:41.173 --> 17:44.024
Yeah, well, then from that,
you can probably extrapolate

17:44.049 --> 17:46.373
what it means to have a tape-snake.

17:46.640 --> 17:48.375
- Wow.
- You have a tape-snake.

17:48.477 --> 17:50.110
- He's there.
- I don't feel it.

17:50.212 --> 17:51.611
Well, when you're asleep, he's awake.

17:51.713 --> 17:54.427
- Where?
- All around you inside.

17:55.619 --> 17:57.268
You're gonna be here an awful long time,

17:57.293 --> 18:00.057
so I would say, why don't
you make yourself at home?
