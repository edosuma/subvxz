That sounds amazing.

14:16.440 --> 14:18.283
EMILY: Then we could always be together.

14:19.840 --> 14:22.366
You know, the girls don't need
a treehouse, Jack.

14:22.920 --> 14:24.285
They need you.

14:24.360 --> 14:26.681
I just hope that one day,
you're not gonna wake up and realize

14:26.800 --> 14:28.609
you missed the best part of life.

14:31.200 --> 14:32.406
CHIEF: You contractors
are all married with kids,

14:32.480 --> 14:35.370
yet none of you wear wedding rings.
Why is that?

14:35.880 --> 14:38.042
Our job is reading people.

14:38.120 --> 14:40.805
So, we can't give anyone an edge,
especially bad guys that might use it.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.680
I know you and Tyrone
go way back, so I'll be frank.

14:45.040 --> 14:47.566
The company thinks
you should be here. I don't.

14:48.480 --> 14:50.881
Truth is, there is no real threat here.

14:51.560 --> 14:53.881
We won the revolution for these people.

14:53.960 --> 14:55.121
The more guns there are here,

14:55.200 --> 14:57.521
the more likely there is
to be a misunderstanding.

14:58.400 --> 15:01.483
This is my last station before retiring.

15:02.280 --> 15:05.363
I don't need a misunderstanding.

15:06.520 --> 15:07.521
Is that clear?

Loud and.

15:10.000 --> 15:12.162
These are your credentials,
two weeks per diem.

15:12.320 --> 15:15.324
I'd spend them quick.
Things change fast here in Benghazi.

15:18.720 --> 15:21.041

new tech word for spy shit.

15:45.560 --> 15:48.965
Jack, since this is your first time with us,
you're gonna be posing as Jillani's husband.

Uh-oh.

15:50.360 --> 15:51.521

Not to this.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.001
I don't understand.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.003
Why do they keep
changing security guards on us?

They think we need babysitting.

Don't try to help.

17:25.839 --> 17:29.049
Yeah, just enjoying
a little Italian beanery here.

You wouldn't know a good coffee bean
from a lump of squirrel shit, country boy.

Yes, it's beautiful, but it's too busy.

25:02.320 --> 25:04.322
Forced-entry, blast-resistant door.

25:04.600 --> 25:06.443
Security bars on the windows.

25:06.600 --> 25:08.443
Inside that is our safe room.

25:08.600 --> 25:10.443
Ambo have any tactical experience?

25:11.520 --> 25:14.000
Nah. He has us.

25:17.360 --> 25:21.046
SCOTT: So, it's a nine-acre
compound, shotgun style

25:21.440 --> 25:22.601
from here,

25:23.520 --> 25:25.363
all the way to the back.

25:26.440 --> 25:27.771
I'll take you there.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.689
His room links to State in D.C. and Tripoli.

25:29.760 --> 25:31.444
JACK: That's the TOC?
SCOTT: Yeah.

25:31.960 --> 25:33.291
Back gate?

25:33.600 --> 25:36.285
DAVE: One way only. Emergency exit.

25:36.600 --> 25:39.285
Got a couple 17 Febs on detail, cameras.

25:39.400 --> 25:40.526
It's locked.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.844
What kind of firepower
you guys carry other than assault rifles?

25:43.920 --> 25:45.410
We've got multiple small arms.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.967
And ammo in the TacOps Center
just beyond the cantina.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.047
That way.

25:49.120 --> 25:50.121
That's it?

25:50.480 --> 25:53.723
I thought every embassy had standard
hard-target security measures.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.968
Car bomb barricades, full-time Marines.

25:56.120 --> 25:57.485
Supposed to.

25:57.640 --> 25:59.324
This isn't an embassy.

25:59.960 --> 26:02.167
We're a temporary diplomatic outpost.

26:02.640 --> 26:04.324
Uncle Sam's on a budget right now,

26:04.400 --> 26:07.483
so I guess normal
security regulations don't apply.

26:08.240 --> 26:10.925
Man, that's some real "dot-gov" shit, huh?

26:11.160 --> 26:13.162
SCOTT: It's like our own little resort.

26:14.080 --> 26:18.165
I hate to piss on your party, ladies,
but five dudes with M4s is not enough.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.081
The locals on your front gate are worthless,

26:21.160 --> 26:22.127
perimeter's soft,

26:22.200 --> 26:24.521
and this whole compound's
a fucking sniper's paradise.

26:24.920 --> 26:27.924
Any big element gets inside here,
you guys are gonna fucking die.

26:29.000 --> 26:30.286
Well, that's heartwarming.

26:30.920 --> 26:31.921
KRIS: What?

26:32.760 --> 26:33.841
No offense.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.450
Guys, we're a mile down the road.

26:35.520 --> 26:39.286
Anything goes down, you call us,
I send Boon, you're good.

26:40.000 --> 26:41.525
JACK: Take care, guys.

26:41.840 --> 26:42.841
What do you think?

26:42.960 --> 26:45.850
A dozen years of military
experience between them, max?

26:46.040 --> 26:47.530
Gonna be a fun week.

27:10.880 --> 27:13.645
Djibouti, request retasking ScanEagle.

I have eyes on both.

Get in position.

27:21.960 --> 27:23.644
Amahl, you lived here all your life, right?

27:23.880 --> 27:24.881
Yes.

27:26.160 --> 27:27.889
Is it true Gaddafi only hired females

27:28.080 --> 27:29.809
for his personal security detail?

27:30.320 --> 27:33.642
Yes. That is accurate.

27:37.360 --> 27:38.486
(LAUGHING)

27:39.480 --> 27:42.484

28:37.720 --> 28:39.324
Amahl, tell this guy to calm down.

28:41.480 --> 28:42.561
Easy, easy.

28:42.720 --> 28:44.324
AMAHL: He's saying bring your weapon down.

28:45.320 --> 28:47.049
He wants his money.

28:47.160 --> 28:48.400
Okay, okay.

28:48.720 --> 28:50.722
This is your money.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.882
TYRONE: Amahl, tell this guy
to calm the fuck down.

28:54.240 --> 28:55.401
That guy's whacked.

28:55.560 --> 28:56.641
Your money.

You know the jambo, yeah?

29:05.840 --> 29:07.001
Come on.

29:07.320 --> 29:09.004
AMAHL: Okay, cool down. Okay?

29:16.920 --> 29:18.524
Cool, baby.

29:18.640 --> 29:19.641
Come on.

29:19.760 --> 29:21.171

29:21.360 --> 29:22.771

29:24.880 --> 29:26.041
These guys are all right.

29:31.800 --> 29:34.326
TIG: Base, we're looking
at a lot of Russian SA-7s.

29:34.400 --> 29:36.687
Tell him to maintain eyes on the truck
as long as he can.

29:37.520 --> 29:41.844
We're gonna find his stash
and we're gonna level it with a Hellfire.

29:42.200 --> 29:43.850
Hi. Hi, Chris Stevens.

29:44.000 --> 29:45.525
- Sona.
- Sona, nice to meet you. Bob.

29:45.720 --> 29:47.529
- CHIEF: Thank you for doing that.
- It's my pleasure.

29:47.600 --> 29:48.886
- It means a lot.
- So good to be back.

29:51.360 --> 29:52.646
Alan, Chris Stevens. Brit, pleasure.

29:52.720 --> 29:55.291
Gentlemen, greetings. Chris Stevens.

29:55.480 --> 29:56.641
Pleasure to meet you, Mr. Ambassador.

29:56.720 --> 29:58.131
Nice to meet you. Step on in.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.691
AMBASSADOR: So between what
we see happening in Egypt with Morsi

30:01.760 --> 30:03.649
and the current destabilization of Syria,

30:03.720 --> 30:05.643
yes, it's easy to imagine

30:05.720 --> 30:07.609
any number of scenarios playing out here.

30:07.920 --> 30:09.604
However, in my mind,

30:09.760 --> 30:12.570
our biggest mistake would
be to not view this moment

30:12.640 --> 30:13.880
as an opportunity.

30:14.080 --> 30:16.970
Relationships between
governments are important, yes,

30:17.040 --> 30:19.008
but relationships between people

30:19.120 --> 30:21.088
are the real foundation of diplomacy.

30:21.240 --> 30:24.608
And I believe
that it is our mission as Americans

30:24.800 --> 30:27.087
to help Benghazans form a free,

30:27.200 --> 30:29.407
democratic and prosperous Libya.

30:39.960 --> 30:41.166
CHIEF: Don't bother apologizing. I'll do it.

30:41.240 --> 30:42.287
Well, I won't.

30:42.400 --> 30:44.687
'Cause I've heard the rah-rah
speech about politics and progress

30:44.760 --> 30:46.250
a hundred goddamn times before.

30:46.400 --> 30:47.561
Well, then I'll write you up.

30:47.680 --> 30:48.806
Sweet.

30:48.960 --> 30:51.486
Chief. Chief,
the guy's going on two hours sleep.

30:51.640 --> 30:54.120
He had a late scout last night
and an early buyback this morning.

30:54.280 --> 30:56.123
Yeah, buying up all of Gaddafi's arms.

30:56.280 --> 30:58.965
Let's count the fucking sand particles
on the beach while we're at it.

that you took off the black market,

31:01.800 --> 31:04.087
that's 30 airplanes that don't go down.

31:04.320 --> 31:06.641
I'm so sick of your shit, Tanto.

how to act like a professional,

31:09.120 --> 31:11.327
there are 10 guys waiting to take your spot.

being an insurance adjuster.

31:19.080 --> 31:20.320
That's the last chance, Tyrone.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.441
TYRONE: All right. GRS,

31:29.520 --> 31:31.443
the Ambassador has
a private meet at the Mayor's office.

31:31.520 --> 31:33.363
So, we're looking at a low-profile event.

31:33.520 --> 31:36.729
We're here to back up State,
so just stay in the background.

Dave, take right side.

You've got to be kidding me.

32:03.840 --> 32:05.171

America is here for you.

32:12.000 --> 32:13.001
We are.

that pisses my wife off.

in an abundance of caution

33:01.040 --> 33:03.281
to remain inside the compound walls all day,

33:03.360 --> 33:07.001
given the 9/11 anniversary,
so no drivers needed.

01:05:31.120 --> 01:05:33.771
Once you get all your guys through here,
you got to close this gate, okay?

01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:35.205
- Okay? All right.
- Okay.

Who's on the phone?

01:05:41.840 --> 01:05:42.841
Okay.

01:05:43.040 --> 01:05:45.407
I call attackers.
Maybe I negotiate surrender.

01:05:45.480 --> 01:05:47.050
Wait. You called the attackers?
You have their phone...

01:05:47.120 --> 01:05:49.043
How the fuck do you have their phone number?

01:05:49.200 --> 01:05:50.884
I now a good boy.

01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:53.322
But I know bad guys.

01:05:54.520 --> 01:05:56.443
- What?
- TIG: Tanto, get in here. We need you.

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:58.807
Yeah, dude, I know, I know, I'm coming.

Hey, I brought these 17 guys, okay?

01:06:33.080 --> 01:06:35.526
But I do think these

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:38.002
assholes, they were trying to steal our cars.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.924
They were the dudes
who were supposed to take point.

01:06:41.040 --> 01:06:42.166
Yeah.

01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:45.005

do you see us? We need to come in.

You know that thing where the initial assault

01:08:29.479 --> 01:08:32.643
is just a ploy to draw people
in for the real attack?

Hey. Hey. They're coming back!

01:08:55.840 --> 01:08:58.684
They said the attackers are regrouping,
adding reinforcements.

Coming back to finish the job?

01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:02.411

It's not good. (COUGHING)

We got one KIA.
We got guys still in the bushes.

No Ambo.

They're still here.

I think we got hostiles everywhere.

The fire has just got to be cover.

01:09:41.040 --> 01:09:44.600
They have control of the compound.
Why else leave so fast?

Black Hawk Down, man.

01:09:46.720 --> 01:09:48.768

his body through the streets.

Come here. Stop pointing your gun!

All right, Boon,
this wall set as new perimeter.

Take cover, hold it.
We're getting DS out of here.

We're gonna stay and look for the Ambo.
You guys need to exfil.

We're short two guys.

All right. Listen to me.
Listen, hey. Listen up!

01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.206
When you go outside that gate,
you go left, you understand?

01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.407
- Yes.
- You understand?

go the other way. Go the other way.

01:27:34.760 --> 01:27:37.684
TYRONE: Oz? This is where we make our stand!

01:27:39.680 --> 01:27:41.523
- It's dark out there.
- BOON: Hey, Rone,

01:27:41.680 --> 01:27:44.524
we're going to Building B.
It's better vantage.

01:27:44.680 --> 01:27:46.091
Get those DS guys off of there.

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.366
State!

01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.770
I want you to go down
and protect Building C from the ground.

with overlapping coverage.

01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.531
Tig, I can use you over here on Tower 3.

01:28:11.120 --> 01:28:12.201
Oz, what do you got?

01:28:14.720 --> 01:28:16.722

of local shepherds walking.

Lot of acreage out there.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.722
- Get on your NODs.
- Copy that.

01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.963
Hey, Chief. Are we expecting any
friendlies to set up a perimeter?

01:28:28.040 --> 01:28:30.486
CHIEF: Uh... Not that I know of. Why?

01:28:30.640 --> 01:28:32.483
KRIS: 'Cause we got cars amassing, east side.

01:28:32.640 --> 01:28:34.051
In the parking lot out by that house

01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:36.162
where the teenagers
are that throw the M-80s over the yard.

Just hold on.

Hey. I got two cop cars pulling in.

01:28:43.240 --> 01:28:46.562
KRIS: Chief, are we expecting
any of Benghazi's finest anytime soon?

01:28:46.720 --> 01:28:47.926
CHIEF: Let me check on it. Hold on.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.001
Yeah. Take your time.

01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:51.085
Alan, check the perimeter.

01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:52.565
Call Benghazi police and see if that's them.

01:28:53.760 --> 01:28:57.481
KRIS: Chief, these cops?
I bet you they work for the bad guys.

01:28:58.160 --> 01:29:00.527
Does this look like 17 Feb to you?

01:29:00.680 --> 01:29:02.444
Dude, how can you fucking tell?

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:04.882
They're all bad guys until they're not.

I got movement. You see this, guys?

01:29:13.280 --> 01:29:14.281
Yeah, I see it.

01:29:15.840 --> 01:29:17.683
I got unknowns moving to the parking lot.

01:29:17.760 --> 01:29:18.761
Fifteen Tangos.

01:29:18.840 --> 01:29:20.126
I gotta call you back.

TYRONE: Oz?

01:29:24.440 --> 01:29:28.604
OZ: All right. I got five more guys
right behind them little shepherds.

01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:31.804
One of them's got something slung.
I can't see what it is.

TYRONE: Everyone's got weapons in Benghazi.

01:29:33.440 --> 01:29:36.446
Until you see a weapon
in someone's hands, you do not fire.

Oh, yeah, they're coming in now. Come on.

01:29:59.920 --> 01:30:02.002
Chief, if we're expecting any friendlies,

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.168
I need to know that information now.

01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.163

Well,

02:04:49.080 --> 02:04:51.003
(GROANING)

02:04:51.080 --> 02:04:52.411
GRS JOOST: Show it to me.

02:04:54.560 --> 02:04:55.925
I lost the Ambo, man.

02:04:56.080 --> 02:04:57.650
GRS JOOST: Are you allergic to morphine?

02:04:57.920 --> 02:04:59.922
I lost the Ambo, Dave. What do I do?

02:05:00.080 --> 02:05:01.923
Shut up and go get a gun on that door.

02:05:02.240 --> 02:05:03.526
- (GROANS)
- Now!

02:05:07.200 --> 02:05:08.326
(VEHICLES APPROACHING)

02:05:10.840 --> 02:05:13.525
KRIS: You hear that, Boon? You hear trucks?

02:05:30.520 --> 02:05:31.521
Chief.

02:05:31.760 --> 02:05:33.888
Are we expecting any friendlies?

02:05:35.280 --> 02:05:36.884
Oh, my God.

02:05:37.800 --> 02:05:41.964
I got 40, 50 vehicles, including technicals.

02:05:42.800 --> 02:05:43.881
I don't know.

02:05:45.120 --> 02:05:47.566
KRIS: It's over, guys. It's fucking over.

02:05:50.040 --> 02:05:52.520
A fucking massive heavy force.

02:05:53.200 --> 02:05:54.725
Cock it, cock it.

02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:13.970
As far as I'm concerned,
this isn't over till it ends.

02:06:15.000 --> 02:06:17.731
That's when they're all dead or we are.

02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:43.163
Oh, Lord! Oh, Jesus!

02:06:43.640 --> 02:06:47.406
Guys, I think they're with us. (PANTING)

02:06:47.480 --> 02:06:48.527
They're with us!

02:06:48.760 --> 02:06:49.761
(TANTO LAUGHING)

02:06:50.160 --> 02:06:52.811
They're with us! (LAUGHING IN RELIEF)

02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.241
(SOBBING)

02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:11.730
Oh!

02:07:24.800 --> 02:07:26.211
Move, move!

02:07:34.840 --> 02:07:36.444
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

02:07:36.520 --> 02:07:38.727
ALEC: It's not safe out here. Keep going.

02:07:39.080 --> 02:07:41.731
SONA: Hurry! Get in the trucks!
They could still be coming.

02:07:42.200 --> 02:07:44.043
Come on, guys, get in the trucks.

02:07:45.520 --> 02:07:47.409
Come on. It's not safe out here.
Come on. Let's go.

02:07:47.920 --> 02:07:49.922
Up, up, up! Please, please, please.

02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:52.090
ALEC: Come on, guys!

02:08:18.280 --> 02:08:20.123
Chief, it's time.

02:08:20.760 --> 02:08:22.489
No, I'm staying.

02:08:22.560 --> 02:08:25.166
Sir, this is the last ride out.

02:08:25.240 --> 02:08:28.722
Yeah, I know. I'm staying.
I've got intel to collect.

02:08:30.120 --> 02:08:31.121
Okay. Let's go!

02:08:31.880 --> 02:08:33.450
What's the hold-up?

02:08:33.880 --> 02:08:35.564
Your Chief, he won't exfil!

02:08:35.720 --> 02:08:36.881
KRIS: It's not safe out here!

02:08:37.040 --> 02:08:38.371
- You what?
- I've got work to do.

02:08:38.480 --> 02:08:39.811
I'm staying.

02:08:39.880 --> 02:08:41.120
For what?

02:08:41.720 --> 02:08:45.645
So that more guys like Ty and Glen
have to come back here?

02:08:45.720 --> 02:08:47.563
And save your ass again?

02:08:49.040 --> 02:08:50.565
You're done here.

02:08:51.960 --> 02:08:54.566
(WHISPERING) Now, get in the fucking car!

02:09:24.360 --> 02:09:25.850
(BARKING)

02:09:51.000 --> 02:09:52.001
KRIS: Amahl.

02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:54.531
We made it, man.

02:09:55.520 --> 02:09:57.284
Come on, get in the truck.

02:09:57.640 --> 02:09:58.971
- I'm going home.
- What?

02:09:59.120 --> 02:10:01.361
I'm so sorry.
This should never have happened.

02:10:04.000 --> 02:10:05.001
Hey.

02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:12.483
Your country's
got to figure this shit out, Amahl.

02:10:12.880 --> 02:10:14.211
- (CAR DOOR CLOSING)
- (ENGINE STARTING)

02:11:20.240 --> 02:11:21.730
(CAR DOOR CLOSING)

02:11:22.640 --> 02:11:23.687
(OZ GRUNTS)

02:11:25.120 --> 02:11:27.248
I walked into this country, I'm walking out.

02:11:29.080 --> 02:11:30.127
Thank you.

02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:57.128
I don't know how you survived all that.

02:11:57.240 --> 02:11:59.208
But I know how the rest of us did.

02:12:00.160 --> 02:12:01.650
You guys did well tonight.

02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:08.569
I'm proud to know Americans like you.

02:12:22.680 --> 02:12:24.808
Couple more hours till our plane.

02:12:25.480 --> 02:12:27.084
Ambassador's body's just about here.

02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:32.170
Hi, sir.

02:12:32.640 --> 02:12:34.165
Can I have car?

02:12:37.000 --> 02:12:38.161
Yeah.

02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:41.887
(ALL CHEERING)

02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:53.170
There's no way.

02:12:53.840 --> 02:12:56.320
No way those mortars found us by chance.

02:12:56.400 --> 02:12:58.402
Had to be set up on us days or weeks ago.

02:13:04.880 --> 02:13:06.041
Listen.

02:13:09.000 --> 02:13:12.561
Any other six guys,
I don't think we'd make it.

02:13:14.240 --> 02:13:16.891
I think we were meant
to be together last night.

02:13:18.200 --> 02:13:20.009
How do you think
the Chief's eval is gonna go?

02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.929
He's going to get a medal. You'll see.

02:13:23.000 --> 02:13:24.081
BOON: And the Deltas?

02:13:24.520 --> 02:13:27.046
Yep. Medals. All of them.

02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:29.730
TIG: And what about us?

02:13:31.240 --> 02:13:33.607
The odds were 1,000-to-1, easy.

02:13:33.880 --> 02:13:35.006
What do we get?

02:13:35.920 --> 02:13:37.524
We get to go home.

02:14:08.880 --> 02:14:09.961
KRIS: Libyan transport.

02:14:11.640 --> 02:14:13.483
Still no Americans.

02:14:14.960 --> 02:14:15.961
JACK: Hey.

02:14:16.960 --> 02:14:18.325
It's me.

02:14:21.120 --> 02:14:23.646
I wanted you to hear it from me first.
We had a...

02:14:23.960 --> 02:14:25.803
A problem here.

02:14:26.920 --> 02:14:30.811
Whatever you hear on the news, it's over now.

02:14:31.840 --> 02:14:33.205
I'm done.

02:14:35.960 --> 02:14:38.042
I'm coming home.

02:14:38.120 --> 02:14:39.485
For good.

02:14:41.480 --> 02:14:42.606
No.

02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:45.282
No, I'm just lucky. I...

02:14:45.840 --> 02:14:47.444
I'm just lucky.

02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:55.330
(SOBS) He didn't make it.

02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:02.648
Rone's not coming home.

02:15:11.320 --> 02:15:13.049
I love you so much.

02:15:43.200 --> 02:15:46.488
TYRONE: "All the gods, all the heavens,
all the hells are within you."

02:15:46.560 --> 02:15:48.608
JACK: What is that?

02:15:48.680 --> 02:15:51.081
TYRONE: Something Boon dropped on me earlier.

02:15:51.160 --> 02:15:53.640
It's just been rattling around
in my head all night.
