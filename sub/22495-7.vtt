[ Sniffs ]

08:50.522 --> 08:52.188
Ohh, that is...ripe.

08:52.224 --> 08:56.459
You've been spreading a virulent
std across the entire galaxy.

08:56.495 --> 09:00.396
I...Have a lot to put right.

09:00.432 --> 09:02.131
Then again, we live
in the 23rd century.

09:02.200 --> 09:02.866
Problem solved.

09:02.934 --> 09:03.866
Damn it, Jim.

09:03.902 --> 09:07.604
You've got to notify every alien you
slept with in the past five years.

09:07.639 --> 09:08.304
Captain's log.

09:08.340 --> 09:10.140
Stardate -- I'm not
talking to Bones anymore.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.509
He's a real...buzzkill.

09:12.578 --> 09:14.877
Relax, it's not like it's space AIDS.

09:14.913 --> 09:18.047
Scotty, here are the coordinates of
every place my wang made contact.

09:18.116 --> 09:18.781
[ Gasps ]

09:18.850 --> 09:19.782
Me mother's house?

09:19.851 --> 09:22.384
I wouldn't kiss her on
the mouth from now on.

09:22.419 --> 09:23.952
Or the butt.

09:24.020 --> 09:27.588
You want to slide those knobs there,
or you want me to keep going?

09:27.623 --> 09:31.390
So, the chances are slim, but
I'd get tested just to be safe.

09:31.426 --> 09:32.424
I'm just a slave.

09:32.460 --> 09:35.693
The fact that you took the time to
tell me really touches my heart.

09:35.729 --> 09:38.796
Just like you...touched mine.

09:38.831 --> 09:39.930
Hey, I heard that.

09:39.965 --> 09:41.331
Chuck, this one's got a bug.

09:41.399 --> 09:42.865
Throw her in the incinerator.

09:42.901 --> 09:46.702
So, remember that...game I
taught you -- the...naked game?

09:46.737 --> 09:49.071
You never told me who won.

09:49.106 --> 09:51.573
We both lost.

09:51.608 --> 09:52.874
Hello, the gorn.

09:52.909 --> 09:55.977
I know we promised never to talk
about our epic battle and how

09:56.012 --> 09:58.980
our hands, clenched in anger,
found themselves intertwined in

09:59.048 --> 10:02.349
passion, but I might
have given you...herpes.

10:02.418 --> 10:06.886
No [bleep]

[ Grunts ]

[ Grunts ]

10:11.259 --> 10:12.792
Oh. Oh.

10:12.860 --> 10:13.593
Really.

10:13.628 --> 10:14.694
Yeah.

10:14.729 --> 10:15.528
Damn it, Jim.

10:15.597 --> 10:16.629
Keep it in your pants.

10:16.698 --> 10:18.531
Bones, you're a doctor, not my mom.

10:18.600 --> 10:20.800
Everyone's been notified,
so no harm, no foul.

10:20.835 --> 10:22.902
Scotty's parents are getting a divorce.

10:22.938 --> 10:26.339
Yes, it's all tied up in a nice
little bow, except for one thing.

10:26.374 --> 10:29.342
Who gave the herpes...to me?

10:29.377 --> 10:30.143
Hey, man.

10:30.178 --> 10:31.945
We got to talk.

10:31.947 --> 10:42.555
