00:01.262 --> 00:02.828
<i>Last time on</i> Naomi...

00:02.872 --> 00:05.353
Having powers doesn't
mean you're ready to use them.

00:05.396 --> 00:08.443
<i>I didn't just</i> <i>
find the disc, Akira.</i> <i>
I found the girl.</i>

00:08.486 --> 00:10.271
<i>Her powers</i> <i>
are beginning to manifest.</i>

00:10.314 --> 00:13.100
This world isn't safe anymore.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.231
<i>Thanks for this.</i>

00:14.275 --> 00:15.319
<i>Anything for you.</i>

00:15.363 --> 00:17.669
Even though you, uh, dumped me.

00:17.713 --> 00:19.802
It doesn't change
the way I feel about you.

00:19.845 --> 00:22.283
<i>I was able to translate</i> <i>
the markings on the disc.</i>

00:22.326 --> 00:24.502
It says "The Twenty-Nine."

00:24.546 --> 00:26.156
<i>We have something</i> <i>
to tell you.</i>

00:26.200 --> 00:27.331
<i>What is this?</i>

00:27.375 --> 00:28.767
This is where we found you.

00:34.556 --> 00:38.212

you came into our lives begins</i> <i>
a long time ago.</i>

02:34.763 --> 02:37.374
You said that you adopted me
someplace on the East Coast.

02:37.418 --> 02:39.071
You said that it was
a closed adoption.

02:39.115 --> 02:43.163
But you really found me here.
In the woods, on a rock.

02:50.692 --> 02:53.999
I've spent my whole life
imagining my birth parents.

02:54.043 --> 02:56.176
Who they are,
where they're from.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.786
Who I really am.

02:59.614 --> 03:02.051
Which you both knew
this whole time.

03:02.094 --> 03:06.577
We should have told you.
We are truly sorry.

03:06.621 --> 03:09.145
But we don't know
any of those details.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.365
We never did.

03:11.408 --> 03:15.064
I tried to find out. I used
every government contact I had.
But there was nothing.

03:15.107 --> 03:18.415
All we knew is that you came
from somewhere...

03:18.459 --> 03:20.678
- up there.
- But how did I get here?

03:20.722 --> 03:22.724
Did I come in some
kind of spaceship?

03:22.767 --> 03:25.901
There was no spaceship.
No wreckage.

03:26.336 --> 03:27.642
Just you.

03:29.731 --> 03:31.385
Someone just left me here?

03:33.430 --> 03:35.258
We don't know that.

03:35.302 --> 03:37.347
Maybe your birth parents
sent you here
to protect you.

03:37.391 --> 03:39.175
Maybe they saved you.

03:40.394 --> 03:42.178
Don't assume
the worst in them.

03:44.485 --> 03:46.791
I know that you're sorry

03:46.835 --> 03:50.447
and I understand
the circumstances.

03:50.491 --> 03:52.188
But why didn't you
tell me sooner?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.973
We kept saying we'd do it
when you were older.

03:55.017 --> 03:57.933
But you seemed happy.
So were we. We felt...

03:58.890 --> 04:00.544
normal.

04:00.588 --> 04:03.286
It was wrong not to tell you.

04:03.330 --> 04:06.158
And we understand
if you hate us.

04:07.508 --> 04:11.294
But we really hope,
maybe one day,

04:11.338 --> 04:13.427
you might be able
to forgive us.

04:15.385 --> 04:16.734
<i>And you did?</i>

04:16.778 --> 04:18.910
- You forgave them?
- Pretty much.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.565
I can't believe Greg and Jen
have been lying to you.

04:21.609 --> 04:23.437
I can't believe
they've been lying to me.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.352
I told my parents everything.

04:25.395 --> 04:29.312
About Dee, about Zumbado,
about the disc.

04:29.356 --> 04:33.490
My mom does that thing where
she gets really teary
and quietly stresses about me.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.318
And my dad went with a lecture.

04:35.362 --> 04:37.146
Greg, no! Read the room.

04:37.189 --> 04:39.540
He just said that I have
to be more careful.

04:39.583 --> 04:41.846
I don't know anything more
than I did yesterday.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.892
Except for the fact that
your parents have been keeping

04:43.935 --> 04:47.069
a giant secret for, like,
your entire life.

04:48.636 --> 04:51.334
You seem surprisingly
chill about this.

04:51.378 --> 04:53.902
Everything's finally back
to normal.

04:53.945 --> 04:56.731
No more secrets.
No more weirdness.

04:56.774 --> 04:58.602
I guess I just wanna
keep it that way.

04:58.646 --> 05:01.388
Babe, you're an alien,
not a robot.

05:01.431 --> 05:03.346
What am I supposed to do?

05:03.390 --> 05:04.652
- Yell? Cry?
Scream into my pillow?

05:04.695 --> 05:07.437
All of the above.
All of the above.

05:07.481 --> 05:11.311
Ladies, we have a big problem.

05:11.354 --> 05:12.921
Is that dried fruit?

05:12.964 --> 05:16.925
Esme decided to help us make
"healthier lifestyle choices."

05:16.968 --> 05:20.189
Since when does
a class president
get to decide on snacks?

05:21.190 --> 05:22.496
She's a monster.

05:22.539 --> 05:26.021
First, no off-campus lunches
and now a sugar ban?

05:26.064 --> 05:27.805
Maybe we should
organize a recall.

05:27.849 --> 05:30.330
That's exactly what
we should do.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.854
- I... I was kidding.
- Yeah. It's a real thing.

05:32.897 --> 05:36.118
All we have to do is to find
someone to run against Esme.

05:36.161 --> 05:38.163
Someone who can
actually beat her.

05:42.124 --> 05:43.386
Yeah, Naomi.

05:43.430 --> 05:45.345
If anyone
can do it, it's you.
- Me?

05:45.388 --> 05:47.608
Just do it.
- No, no. Guys,
that's not what I meant.

05:47.651 --> 05:51.481
Come on, you'd be great.
Weren't you planning on
running next year anyway?

05:51.525 --> 05:54.702
Well, yeah, I was, but now...

05:54.745 --> 05:56.443
I'm just not sure
it's the best idea.

05:56.486 --> 05:58.923
She kind of has
a lot on her plate.

05:58.967 --> 06:03.711
Naomi, we can't let this stand.
There are pistachios in there.

06:03.754 --> 06:06.496
Please, Naomi. Save us.

06:06.540 --> 06:07.454
Please.

06:15.331 --> 06:16.767
Okay. Yeah. Yeah. I'm in.

06:16.811 --> 06:19.640
- Let's take back
our candy bars.

06:19.683 --> 06:21.032
Down with almonds!

06:23.731 --> 06:26.124
- Easy. Easy.

06:27.604 --> 06:30.390
Focus on precise,
calculated movements.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.575
Dee, I'm so sorry. I didn't
even know I could do that.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.191
Naomi, it's okay.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.541
It's okay.

06:51.585 --> 06:53.195
Really.

06:53.238 --> 06:57.199
Maybe next session,
we'll start
the meditation training.

06:57.242 --> 07:01.116
I'm not really into the whole
yoga pants
on a mountaintop thing.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.511
Meditation is about
being aware and present.

07:04.554 --> 07:06.469
A mind that isn't aware
of its emotions

07:06.513 --> 07:08.471
is at risk of being
controlled by them.

07:11.039 --> 07:14.085
Is there, um, something
on your mind?

07:16.087 --> 07:17.480
Yeah, I found out my parents

07:17.524 --> 07:20.657
have known I'm from
another planet all along.

07:20.701 --> 07:24.705
They took me into the woods
and showed me this rock
where they found me.

07:24.748 --> 07:27.490
That explains the, uh,
punching bag.

07:27.534 --> 07:29.666
- That must have been difficult.
- I'm fine.

07:30.537 --> 07:31.712
It was just weird.

07:39.502 --> 07:40.634
I also told them about you.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.723
And now they want you
to come to dinner.

07:42.766 --> 07:43.767
I'm so sorry,
I should've asked.

07:43.811 --> 07:45.465
It just happened so fast.

07:47.336 --> 07:49.338
Well, I appreciate
your honesty.

07:49.381 --> 07:50.861
I think the worst part

07:50.905 --> 07:52.689
is my parents weren't able
to tell me anything

07:52.733 --> 07:54.604
about where I'm from
or who I am.

08:00.958 --> 08:03.221
For someone to send you here...

08:03.265 --> 08:05.789
the situation must
have been very bad.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.399
What do you mean?

08:07.443 --> 08:09.097
The universe is vast.

08:09.140 --> 08:11.621
There are more planets than
humans have even counted.

08:11.665 --> 08:13.710
More than they can imagine.

08:13.754 --> 08:15.582
I don't even know
all of them myself.

08:17.540 --> 08:18.759
But there's a hierarchy.

08:18.802 --> 08:21.762
Some planets are strong,
others are weak.

08:21.805 --> 08:23.154
And there are a few

08:23.198 --> 08:25.809
that are considered
the most special of all.

08:25.853 --> 08:28.029
You think I'm from
one of those planets?

08:28.072 --> 08:28.812
Yes.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.119
Naomi, you are different.

08:31.162 --> 08:33.774
I knew it from the first time
I sensed you.

08:33.817 --> 08:36.559
Your powers, your energy.

08:36.603 --> 08:38.082
It's rare.

08:38.126 --> 08:41.477
I may not know
who you are exactly...

08:41.521 --> 08:46.656
but I know you're someone
very special in this universe.

08:46.700 --> 08:48.484
You have great power.

08:57.537 --> 08:58.973
I'm here for my disc.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.279
The real one.

09:02.803 --> 09:05.327
You should go home, Naomi.

09:05.370 --> 09:06.850
I'm not afraid of you.

09:13.640 --> 09:16.425
Not many people do this
by hand anymore.

09:17.687 --> 09:19.036
The machine is easier.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.299
Faster.

09:22.605 --> 09:24.389
People prefer the convenience.

09:26.261 --> 09:28.263
There's no substitute
for the work.

09:29.873 --> 09:31.179
These things take time.

09:38.839 --> 09:40.580
I know who you are.

09:40.623 --> 09:41.798
What you are.

09:43.626 --> 09:45.715
I very much doubt that.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.674
I know that you're not
from this Earth.

09:49.023 --> 09:51.112
And I know what the numbers
on the disc say.

09:51.765 --> 09:52.940
The Twenty-Nine.

09:55.725 --> 09:58.380
I've warned you,
I've threatened you.

09:58.423 --> 10:01.775
Yet here you are, so certain
that you know
what's happening.

10:03.777 --> 10:06.780
I'm not leaving
without my disc.

10:22.883 --> 10:24.232
It's real.

10:27.757 --> 10:29.846
And you're just
giving it to me.

10:31.848 --> 10:33.197
Why would you do that?

10:34.372 --> 10:36.418
I told you before.

10:36.461 --> 10:38.594
Don't believe
everything you think.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.045
<i>♪ Ra, ra, ra</i>

10:55.089 --> 10:58.788
<i>♪ Everybody singing</i> <i>
Just like la, la, la ♪</i>

10:58.832 --> 11:02.618
<i>♪ Everybody shouting now</i> <i>
Like ya, ya, ya ♪</i>

11:02.662 --> 11:06.274
<i>♪ I don't care about it now,</i> <i>

11:06.317 --> 11:10.104

11:17.764 --> 11:21.593
<i>♪ Everybody cheering</i> <i>

11:21.637 --> 11:25.685
<i>♪ Everybody singing</i> <i>
Just like la, la, la ♪</i>

11:26.598 --> 11:27.774
What the hell...

11:32.213 --> 11:33.301
I have questions.

11:33.344 --> 11:34.955
Many, many questions.

11:34.998 --> 11:37.479
One, why did scary Zumbado
just give you the disc?

11:37.522 --> 11:39.960
Two, are we worried
that the disc
is going to explode?

11:40.003 --> 11:42.789
Three, why does the disc always
want me to do math?

11:42.832 --> 11:44.834
These numbers
were on the disc.

11:44.878 --> 11:47.184
- It's a cipher.
- Clearly binary.

11:47.228 --> 11:50.710
Might even be
Vigenere or Caesar.

11:50.753 --> 11:52.233
I used
the monogram frequencies,

11:52.276 --> 11:55.497
and the index of coincidence
is .06.

11:55.540 --> 11:56.890
My little nerds.

11:56.933 --> 11:59.153
I literally don't understand
a word you're saying.

12:05.812 --> 12:07.639
All codes can be cracked.

12:07.683 --> 12:10.207
You just have
to find the right method.

12:10.251 --> 12:11.774
I just haven't found it yet.

12:11.818 --> 12:13.776
Don't feel bad.
Did you see <i>Interstellar?</i>

12:13.820 --> 12:16.300
Even McConaughey struggled
with this sort of thing.

12:17.824 --> 12:19.826
What if we ran a PCO algorithm?

12:19.869 --> 12:21.305
Like the one we built
in coding club?

12:22.219 --> 12:23.960
That could work.

12:24.004 --> 12:26.267
Although, it might
take a while to find
the solution vectors.

12:26.310 --> 12:27.747
Okay, then let's get started.

12:34.275 --> 12:35.580
Sir, what's happening?

12:35.624 --> 12:36.451
It feels like
we're under attack.

12:36.494 --> 12:37.931
We might be, Major.

12:37.974 --> 12:40.847
That blackout last night
sent our systems offline.

12:40.890 --> 12:42.500
You suspect alien activity?

12:42.544 --> 12:44.067
We detected electron diffusion

12:44.111 --> 12:46.896
occurring within the region
just prior to the blackout.

12:47.941 --> 12:50.291
A possible dimensional breach.

12:50.334 --> 12:51.509
You think someone's arrived?

12:51.553 --> 12:53.076
That's our working theory, yes.

12:53.990 --> 12:55.687
That blackout

12:55.731 --> 12:57.428
was the result of
a massive energy draw.

12:57.472 --> 12:59.039
Over a gigawatt.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.692
Someone could do
a lot of bad things

13:00.736 --> 13:01.737
with that much energy.

13:01.781 --> 13:03.173
Exactly.

13:03.217 --> 13:04.914
We need to find out
the origin point
of that blackout

13:04.958 --> 13:06.220
and figure out
what the hell just happened.

13:21.713 --> 13:23.977
Hi.

13:25.500 --> 13:26.718
Forgot my book.

13:31.723 --> 13:34.552
Isn't there a big campaign
thing happening right now?

13:34.596 --> 13:36.903
Yeah, Annabelle thought we
should have an open mic forum,

13:36.946 --> 13:38.687
and Jacob brought
his karaoke machine.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.516
You're straight-up
hiding right now.

13:41.559 --> 13:42.865
What? No, I'm not.

13:44.649 --> 13:46.782
- Okay, maybe a little.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.702
You know, "President McDuffie"
does have a nice ring to it.

13:55.922 --> 13:57.924
But, uh...

13:57.967 --> 13:59.273
are you sure this is
what you really want?

14:00.796 --> 14:03.451
I was just
taking a break, but...

14:03.494 --> 14:05.757
You know, you're right.
I should get back.

14:05.801 --> 14:06.933
That's not what I meant.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.893
It just, uh, seems like

14:10.937 --> 14:13.069
maybe your heart's
not really in this.

14:16.856 --> 14:19.206
Everyone wants me to run.

14:20.598 --> 14:22.339
So?

14:22.383 --> 14:24.776
Who cares what they want?

14:24.820 --> 14:26.343
You need to trust how you feel.

14:27.170 --> 14:28.389
That's all that matters.

14:34.438 --> 14:37.311
How are you always
so sure about everything?

14:38.965 --> 14:40.880
I'm not sure about anything.

14:42.838 --> 14:43.970
Well...

14:45.536 --> 14:46.886
except for one thing.

14:55.895 --> 14:57.548
Babe!

14:57.592 --> 14:58.854
There you are.

14:58.898 --> 15:00.073
You missed Jacob
singing "The Boss."

15:00.116 --> 15:01.378
- Epic.
It really was.

15:02.640 --> 15:05.382
Um, but I come
bearing bad news.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.123
Our algorithm failed us.

15:07.167 --> 15:09.212
I can't figure out
the code, either.

15:09.256 --> 15:10.953
I think our method
is too complicated.

15:10.997 --> 15:11.998
We need something simple.

15:13.216 --> 15:14.217
Like...

15:14.261 --> 15:15.958
a Turing machine.

15:16.002 --> 15:18.961
Is that the thing that makes
those little cups of coffee?

15:19.005 --> 15:20.310
Turing.

15:21.616 --> 15:23.096
As in, Alan Turing.

15:23.139 --> 15:24.924
The mathematician
who developed a machine

15:24.967 --> 15:26.447
to break the
Nazis' Enigma code.

15:26.490 --> 15:29.145
He was instrumental in helping
the Allies defeat Germany.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.017
Not many people have
those anymore, though.

15:31.060 --> 15:32.496
Mostly just hobbyists.

15:35.238 --> 15:37.066
Then we need to find someone
who does.

15:39.416 --> 15:41.766
I hope that chicken's
not too dry.

15:41.810 --> 15:43.551
I sometimes overcook it.

15:43.594 --> 15:45.335
I'm sure it's delicious.

15:45.379 --> 15:47.990
Mom, he has wings.

15:48.034 --> 15:49.557
Like a bird?

15:52.125 --> 15:55.041
Dee, I am so sorry.
Please, let me
make you something else.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.390
It... it's fine.

15:56.433 --> 15:58.131
Uh, really, I'm okay.

16:10.665 --> 16:11.927
Naomi, why don't you tell us

16:11.971 --> 16:13.798
how your training
with Dee is going?

16:13.842 --> 16:14.886
Good.

16:14.930 --> 16:17.019
He's teaching me how to box.

16:17.063 --> 16:19.021
I had no idea how much
discipline it requires.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.155
It's really about
learning control.

16:23.895 --> 16:26.333
We're introducing, uh,
meditation next.

16:27.551 --> 16:29.205
Oh, that's wonderful.

16:29.249 --> 16:32.078
The recent science
is very compelling.

16:32.121 --> 16:35.037
I wouldn't have pegged you
as a New Agey kind of guy.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.734
You know, then again,

16:36.778 --> 16:37.997
I wouldn't have pegged you
as a guy who has wings.

16:41.217 --> 16:43.524
Meditation is, uh,
very centering.

16:46.962 --> 16:48.224
Right.

16:54.056 --> 16:56.406
You've been in Port Oswego
a long time, Dee.

16:56.450 --> 16:57.451
Almost 20 years.

16:59.018 --> 17:01.977
Well, not the whole 20 years.

17:08.288 --> 17:09.202
Dad, what are you doing?

17:09.245 --> 17:11.900
I'm just making conversation.

17:13.119 --> 17:15.077
It's okay, Naomi.

17:15.121 --> 17:17.688
I'm sure your father
has done his homework on me.

17:17.732 --> 17:19.081
He's right.

17:19.125 --> 17:21.344
I did leave town for
a couple of years.

17:23.694 --> 17:27.089
Actually, I left Earth entirely
back in 2012.

17:28.438 --> 17:31.006
Did you go back
to your home planet?

17:31.050 --> 17:32.399
I'd rather not talk about it.

17:41.451 --> 17:45.325
You seem to be embracing
this whole
"aliens are real" thing.

17:47.240 --> 17:51.244
- Well, it definitely took some
getting used to, but, uh...
- Yeah.

17:51.287 --> 17:52.245
...we love our daughter.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.945
Naomi tells me
you found her, uh,

17:56.988 --> 17:58.381
on a strange rock

17:58.425 --> 17:59.730
in the woods.

17:59.774 --> 18:02.690
Was there any kind of light
hovering above it?

18:02.733 --> 18:06.128
No. Just our Naomi,
wrapped in a blanket.

18:06.172 --> 18:08.174
Light... Why would
there be any light?

18:08.217 --> 18:09.523
It's an energy source.

18:10.480 --> 18:13.353
Normally present
at arrival events.

18:13.396 --> 18:15.137
Well, there was
nothing like that.

18:16.356 --> 18:18.271
And there was
no one else there?

18:18.880 --> 18:20.055
That's right.

18:23.189 --> 18:25.974
So, Naomi says your wings
can somehow sense

18:26.017 --> 18:28.194
if a person
isn't from this Earth.

18:28.237 --> 18:30.239
Within a certain range.

18:30.283 --> 18:32.894
And if they have powers.

18:32.937 --> 18:34.765
That's how I knew Naomi

18:34.809 --> 18:36.419
was not from this planet.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.552
Which... which you told her
before we could.

18:38.595 --> 18:39.422
Dad.

18:40.815 --> 18:42.512
You only had 16 years.

18:51.217 --> 18:53.262
Looks like we need a new bulb.

19:01.444 --> 19:02.271
Who's ready for dessert?

19:03.403 --> 19:04.926
I should go.

19:04.969 --> 19:06.057
It's getting late.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.540
Thank you for a, um,
lovely dinner.

19:22.248 --> 19:24.293
So, there's supposed
to be Turing machine in here?

19:24.337 --> 19:27.557
I did this escape room
last year in Portland
called Merlin's Revenge,

19:27.601 --> 19:28.602
and it was awesome.

19:28.645 --> 19:30.430
The one with
the secret bookcase

19:30.473 --> 19:32.214
- that leads
to the magician's lair?
Yeah.

19:32.258 --> 19:34.477
Is anyone else a little
freaked out that we're, like...

19:35.348 --> 19:36.349
trapped in here?

19:36.392 --> 19:38.220
Dude, we're not
actually trapped.

19:38.264 --> 19:40.527
The owner said
the Turing machine
was a part of this.

19:41.267 --> 19:43.399
There must be a second room.

19:43.443 --> 19:44.966
We have to beat the game.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.316

19:59.676 --> 20:03.245
Wait, so we're supposed to
solve the clue by smelling it?

20:03.289 --> 20:04.725
I think we have to figure out
the flower

20:04.768 --> 20:06.335
by matching it to the smell.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.209
It could be lavender.

20:11.079 --> 20:12.298
Mmm, definitely not.

20:12.341 --> 20:14.343
My mom had lavender potpourri,
and that smell

20:14.387 --> 20:16.215
has been burned into my brain.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.394
Lilac!

20:23.439 --> 20:24.788
There's
the Turing machine.

20:24.832 --> 20:26.268
<i>♪ I tried to piece it</i> <i>

20:26.312 --> 20:27.965

20:34.450 --> 20:36.278
I think these are coordinates.

20:37.627 --> 20:40.369
There's also
a description.

20:40.413 --> 20:43.459
A blonde woman
with blue eyes.

20:47.333 --> 20:48.421
W.

20:55.254 --> 20:56.603
For west.

20:56.646 --> 20:58.387
- Yes!

20:58.431 --> 20:59.823
I think the first set
of coordinates

20:59.867 --> 21:02.217
is a street corner in Portland.

21:02.261 --> 21:03.740
Why is she in Portland?

21:04.524 --> 21:05.655
I have no idea.

21:06.700 --> 21:08.179
But I'm gonna find out.

21:13.489 --> 21:14.621
- Morning.
- Morning, pumpkin.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.232
Morning.

21:17.276 --> 21:19.103
Might want to hold off
on that bagel.

21:19.147 --> 21:21.454
I'm making French toast.

21:21.497 --> 21:22.890
That's okay.

21:22.933 --> 21:25.327
Um, I think
I'll stick with the bagel.

21:25.371 --> 21:28.591
Uh, we were hoping to have
a post-dinner "Dee-brief"

21:28.635 --> 21:29.984
over breakfast.

21:33.248 --> 21:34.902
Really? Nothing?

21:34.945 --> 21:36.817
I mean, that was
one of my best puns.

21:38.209 --> 21:40.690
We just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

21:40.734 --> 21:43.171
Last night was a lot.

21:44.390 --> 21:45.304
I'm fine.

21:53.399 --> 21:55.139
But you guys were pretty harsh
on Dee.

21:55.879 --> 21:58.142
That wasn't our intention.

22:01.929 --> 22:04.497
But how much do you really
know about him?

22:04.540 --> 22:06.020
We just don't want
you to get hurt.

22:09.545 --> 22:10.590
You know,
I think I should really go.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.505
Uh, I have student council

22:12.548 --> 22:14.985
and then I have
a town hall meeting,
so I won't be home for dinner.

22:15.029 --> 22:17.988
You're running
for student council?
Since when?

22:18.032 --> 22:19.816
- A couple of days ago.
Why didn't you tell us?

22:19.860 --> 22:22.253
I mean, we're excellent
campaign advisers.

22:23.559 --> 22:24.908
It all just happened
really fast.

22:28.477 --> 22:31.567
You know, pumpkin, we threw
a lot at you the other night.

22:31.611 --> 22:32.612
It's...

22:32.655 --> 22:34.788
okay to be upset.

22:34.831 --> 22:37.007
You can always be honest
with us.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.574
Always.

22:38.618 --> 22:40.141
You know that, right?

22:41.316 --> 22:42.622
I do know that.

22:42.665 --> 22:43.884
And I'm fine.

22:44.493 --> 22:45.364
Really.

22:46.669 --> 22:48.018
I'll see you guys tonight?

22:48.541 --> 22:49.803
See you tonight.

22:59.595 --> 23:00.814
Can I help you?

23:03.469 --> 23:04.687
Just browsing, friend.

23:05.688 --> 23:08.343
This area's off limits.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.606
Off limits is just a matter
of price, isn't it?

23:14.044 --> 23:15.655
Depends on what
you're looking for.

23:17.265 --> 23:19.354
It's hard to say.

23:19.398 --> 23:21.400
The best cars are usually
hiding something.

23:30.496 --> 23:31.801
Who are you?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.977
What do you want?

23:36.719 --> 23:38.199
Something rare,

23:38.242 --> 23:39.287
valuable.

23:40.549 --> 23:42.246
Powerful enough
to be dangerous.

23:43.509 --> 23:44.858
I'll know when I see it.

23:44.901 --> 23:46.642
Something that dangerous...

23:48.035 --> 23:49.776
you might get in
over your head.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.518
I wouldn't have come
all this way

23:52.561 --> 23:53.867
if I wasn't sure
I could handle it.

23:56.565 --> 23:59.394
Like I said, just browsing.

24:03.093 --> 24:05.095
Then I suggest
you look elsewhere.

24:06.619 --> 24:08.447
You won't like
what you find here.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.695
Blonde hair.

24:43.438 --> 24:44.483
Blue eyes.

25:23.913 --> 25:25.393
You shouldn't have done that.

25:25.436 --> 25:26.873
You might expose yourself.

25:28.788 --> 25:30.093
Well, If you hadn't run,

25:30.137 --> 25:31.399
I wouldn't have had
to chase you.

25:34.054 --> 25:36.491
You're not what I expected.

25:36.535 --> 25:37.797
Did Zumbado send you?

25:37.840 --> 25:39.494
You know Zumbado?

25:41.888 --> 25:44.586
No. No, he didn't send me here.

25:44.630 --> 25:47.763
Good. Zumbado is dangerous.

25:47.807 --> 25:50.157
He's the one
who ruined Earth-29.

25:51.767 --> 25:53.726
Earth-29?

25:53.769 --> 25:55.466
Is that where you're from?

25:57.512 --> 25:58.992
Is that where I'm from?

26:07.783 --> 26:10.046
Where is it? What is it like?

26:14.007 --> 26:15.748
It used to be beautiful.

26:17.271 --> 26:18.664
Vibrant.

26:18.707 --> 26:20.404
It was full of color and life.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.714
But now... that's all gone,

26:25.758 --> 26:27.150
thanks to him.

26:29.588 --> 26:33.592
If Zumbado didn't send you,
you found me using the disc?

26:34.723 --> 26:36.638
You shouldn't have
activated it.

26:36.682 --> 26:37.813
What do you know
about the disc?

26:37.857 --> 26:39.728
It's a mistake.

26:39.772 --> 26:41.600
We thought we might need it
to find each other,

26:41.643 --> 26:45.038
which we should have known
might be a bad idea.

26:45.081 --> 26:47.301
Wait. Who would need
to find each other?

26:47.344 --> 26:48.737
Please.

26:48.781 --> 26:51.044
Uh... just tell me who you are.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.307
Tell me who I am.

26:56.615 --> 26:58.442
This is hard to understand.

26:58.486 --> 27:01.968
The less you know,

27:16.809 --> 27:19.594
<i>♪ Headed to Spring Street</i>

27:23.990 --> 27:25.208
Thanks for coming.

27:30.170 --> 27:32.651
Aren't you gonna ask me
what I'm doing in Portland?

27:33.869 --> 27:35.218
You'll tell me
when you're ready.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.704
Thanks for picking me up again.

27:42.748 --> 27:45.272
I really didn't want
to bother my parents.

27:45.315 --> 27:47.013
But you don't have to worry.

27:47.056 --> 27:48.014
It's all fine.

27:49.885 --> 27:53.933
You, uh... made a light bulb
flicker at dinner

27:53.976 --> 27:56.718
during a tense moment
with your parents.

27:56.762 --> 27:58.720
Did you know that?

27:58.764 --> 28:00.679
I can also make them explode.

28:02.898 --> 28:04.726
The light bulb's
not the problem.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.685
I didn't realize
there was a problem.

28:06.728 --> 28:10.819
There's a connection between
your emotions and your powers.

28:10.863 --> 28:13.039
Ever since you found out
your parents have, uh,

28:13.082 --> 28:14.083
not been honest...

28:15.868 --> 28:19.175
have you been in more
or less control of them?

28:23.179 --> 28:24.659
Are you gonna tell me

28:24.703 --> 28:26.139
I need to be more honest
with my parents?

28:27.923 --> 28:28.794
No.

28:30.056 --> 28:31.884
You need to be honest
with yourself.

28:37.846 --> 28:40.327
Our next question is from AJ.

28:40.370 --> 28:45.419
"Are you waging a war on candy?
If so, who hurt you?"

28:47.073 --> 28:50.641
I appreciate AJ's concern,
but the candy situation

28:50.685 --> 28:53.906
is about my concern
for all of you.

28:53.949 --> 28:56.604
Because you know
what has hurt people?

28:56.647 --> 28:57.953
- Sugar.

28:57.997 --> 28:59.607
We're in the middle
of an epidemic...

28:59.650 --> 29:01.217
Give me a break.

29:01.261 --> 29:02.697
Where is she?

29:03.611 --> 29:04.873
She'll be here.

29:04.917 --> 29:06.396
I've been texting her
for an hour.

29:06.440 --> 29:09.095
So, either her phone's dead,
she's dead, or we're dead.

29:09.878 --> 29:10.836
Are we dead?

29:12.533 --> 29:13.969
Sir.

29:14.840 --> 29:16.580
What do we have, Major?

29:16.624 --> 29:18.539
A massive electromagnetic
signal just ripped through
Port Oswego.

29:18.582 --> 29:21.150
Every cell and radio tower
within 100 miles
just picked it up.

29:21.194 --> 29:23.500
So we found
our missing gigawatt.

29:23.544 --> 29:25.633
You think this could be
another arrival event?

29:25.676 --> 29:26.590
No.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.722
No, this is different.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.158
The signal's repeating.

29:29.202 --> 29:31.987
The pulse frequency resembles
something like radar.

29:32.031 --> 29:33.075
Like someone's searching?

29:33.684 --> 29:35.121
Yes, sir.

29:35.164 --> 29:36.296
The question is for what.

29:36.339 --> 29:38.951
And now let's hear
from our challenger.

29:38.994 --> 29:40.909
Please welcome Naomi McDuffie.

29:44.478 --> 29:46.349
Our first question
is from Henry.

29:46.393 --> 29:47.742
"Why should we vote for you?"

29:49.831 --> 29:50.876
Um...

29:52.138 --> 29:53.879
Before I start...

29:53.922 --> 29:55.228
I just want to say,

29:55.271 --> 29:58.274
whatever problems we have
with Esme's policies,

29:58.318 --> 30:00.189
we shouldn't have with her.

30:00.233 --> 30:02.235
No one cares about
this school more.

30:02.278 --> 30:05.325
And she's always been upfront
about what she's doing and why.

30:05.368 --> 30:08.067
It's not always easy putting
yourself on the line like that.

30:10.156 --> 30:12.593
We have some possible locations
for the signal, Major.

30:12.636 --> 30:13.986
Putting it on your screen.

30:17.685 --> 30:18.947
You recognize something?

30:22.081 --> 30:23.125
No.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.693
It's easier to wait
for someone else

30:25.736 --> 30:27.869
to take care of our problems.

30:27.913 --> 30:29.349
Until one day you look up

30:29.392 --> 30:32.656
and there are no candy bars
in the vending machine.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.007
I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

30:36.356 --> 30:38.662
being honest
about what you really

30:38.706 --> 30:40.055
want and how you feel...

30:40.882 --> 30:42.318
It's scary,

30:42.362 --> 30:44.930
especially if you don't know
how others will react.

30:45.931 --> 30:47.889
It makes you feel vulnerable.

30:48.716 --> 30:50.805
It leaves room for rejection.

30:52.067 --> 30:53.808
And It makes you feel weak.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.946
But...

31:00.989 --> 31:03.426
if we decide to face it

31:03.470 --> 31:07.778
and be engaged and active,
despite the risk,

31:07.822 --> 31:09.868
there's nothing that this
school can't do.

31:11.478 --> 31:13.741
And I promise to do that.

31:13.784 --> 31:16.004
And that's why you should
vote for me.

31:27.407 --> 31:30.366
Candy!
Candy! Candy!

31:41.987 --> 31:44.032
<i>Someone's looking</i> <i>

31:51.039 --> 31:53.520
No wonder politicians
are cranky.

31:53.563 --> 31:54.913
I'm exhausted.

31:56.175 --> 31:57.959
You know what would sound
so good right now?

31:58.003 --> 31:59.221
Bed?

31:59.265 --> 32:01.267
A double cheeseburger
from Murray's.

32:01.310 --> 32:03.138
No pickles, extra onions.

32:03.182 --> 32:06.011
- Side of fries, extra crispy--
- I don't know.

32:06.054 --> 32:07.838
I have a calc test
first period,

32:07.882 --> 32:10.667
and you know how cranky I am
if I don't get a solid six.

32:10.711 --> 32:13.366
But you could get
one of those shakes
that you love.

32:13.409 --> 32:15.455
Double chocolate fudge
with whipped cream and--

32:15.498 --> 32:19.981
Extra chocolate sprinkles.
Tiny slivers of magic.

32:20.025 --> 32:21.417
You do know the way
to my heart.

32:23.158 --> 32:25.117
Fine. I'm in.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.509
I have to get something
from my locker,

32:26.553 --> 32:27.902
but I'll meet you there?

32:57.801 --> 32:59.238
Who are you?

32:59.281 --> 33:01.109
I'm here to take you back.

33:01.153 --> 33:02.763
Take me back?

33:02.806 --> 33:04.199
To Earth-29.

33:04.243 --> 33:06.462
There are a lot of people
looking for you.

33:07.507 --> 33:10.162
Sorry. It's just business.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.251
I'm not going anywhere
with you.

33:12.294 --> 33:13.992
I'm afraid
you don't have choice.

35:08.584 --> 35:10.325
I searched the campus.

35:13.198 --> 35:14.286
He's gone.

35:16.331 --> 35:17.376
You're safe now.

35:19.465 --> 35:20.596
Who was he?

35:25.123 --> 35:26.298
I believe he was
a bounty hunter.

35:27.473 --> 35:29.388
Bounty hunter?

35:29.431 --> 35:30.519
From where?

35:33.566 --> 35:36.221
There are many beings
like him in the multi-verse.

35:37.657 --> 35:40.703
He said that he was gonna
take me back to Earth-29.

35:42.270 --> 35:44.185
How did he even find me?

35:46.100 --> 35:47.188
I don't know.

35:48.363 --> 35:49.582
But you have an idea.

35:53.063 --> 35:54.543
Dee, what are you
not telling me?

35:57.067 --> 35:58.330
I think his arrival

35:58.373 --> 36:00.549
might be tied to the emergence
of your powers.

36:00.593 --> 36:03.335
They could be acting
as a magnet.

36:03.378 --> 36:05.250
So there might be others
that will come?

36:07.904 --> 36:09.297
What if they find me?

36:12.257 --> 36:14.084
Then they'll have
to go through me.

36:24.312 --> 36:26.358
You were right
about my powers.

36:28.447 --> 36:31.276
I tried to control them,
but I couldn't.

36:31.319 --> 36:32.538
I was too afraid.

36:34.366 --> 36:37.369
The first step towards
fixing a problem

36:37.412 --> 36:39.240
is admitting you have one.

36:41.373 --> 36:42.722
Acknowledging your
true feelings

36:43.940 --> 36:45.507
doesn't make you weak.

36:47.422 --> 36:49.250
It makes you strong.

36:49.294 --> 36:51.339
That kind of sounds
like an oxymoron.

36:58.172 --> 36:59.695
Can I tell you something?

37:00.435 --> 37:01.393
Mmm-hmm.

37:05.788 --> 37:07.225
This Q

37:07.877 --> 37:09.357
is for Qyeala.

37:10.445 --> 37:11.620
What does it mean?

37:18.453 --> 37:19.802
To me, everything.

37:22.414 --> 37:24.720
It's the name of
the one I loved.

37:29.377 --> 37:33.338
She's the reason why I left
the planet back in 2012.

37:35.296 --> 37:36.428
What happened to her?

37:38.778 --> 37:40.214
I don't know.

37:42.347 --> 37:43.391
But

37:43.435 --> 37:46.394
I do know that life is short.

37:49.049 --> 37:51.312
And I wish I had
known back then...

37:52.270 --> 37:55.621
how precious time is.

37:58.188 --> 38:00.408
I wish I had...

38:00.452 --> 38:03.498
told Q how much
she meant to me.

38:06.371 --> 38:07.807
Why didn't you tell her?

38:09.896 --> 38:11.289
I was afraid.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.467
I was too scared to love.

38:17.077 --> 38:19.253
To say the things I felt.

38:24.824 --> 38:26.652
Love is important, Naomi.

38:29.568 --> 38:32.614
If you find it,
you hold on to it.

38:34.790 --> 38:36.531
Even when it scares you.

38:41.971 --> 38:44.278
At 2014 hundred hours,
the signal went dead.

38:44.322 --> 38:48.369
Alpha Team also found no sign
of life or a device
at either of the sites.

38:48.413 --> 38:51.024
So, whoever this was, just...

38:51.067 --> 38:52.242
vanished.

38:52.286 --> 38:53.374
For now.

38:53.418 --> 38:54.593
We're monitoring it.

38:55.550 --> 38:57.247
Alpha Leader said you detoured

38:57.291 --> 38:59.380
prior to the arrival
at the second site.

38:59.424 --> 39:01.687
The data suggested
a third site nearby.

39:03.166 --> 39:06.387
I decided to investigate,
but I didn't find anything.

39:08.694 --> 39:09.825
Thank you, Major.

39:30.542 --> 39:32.457
- Hi.
- Hi.

39:34.459 --> 39:37.592

last night.

39:37.636 --> 39:38.898

39:38.941 --> 39:42.641
to start addressing you
as Madame President.

39:42.684 --> 39:45.774
No. I dropped out.

39:46.949 --> 39:48.255
