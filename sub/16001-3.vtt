00:00.208 --> 00:01.375
[Brian] Previously
on What About Brian:

00:01.458 --> 00:04.500
- I'm in love with Marjorie.
- Adam's in love with Marjorie.

00:04.500 --> 00:07.959
- And Adam's your best friend.
- [Deena] Adam and Marjorie
got engaged.

00:07.959 --> 00:11.250
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:11.250 --> 00:16.041
[Brian] We're gonna pretend
it never happened, go back
to the way it was.

00:16.041 --> 00:17.458
How do we do that?

00:17.458 --> 00:20.959
Brian, I have to go to work,
but you can have a shower.

00:21.834 --> 00:23.333
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:23.333 --> 00:24.583
- I'm Brian.
- Lisa.

00:24.583 --> 00:26.333
I like this roommate girl.

00:26.333 --> 00:27.959
- Can I call?
- I don't think so.

00:27.959 --> 00:30.250
- It would just be too...
- Weird.

00:30.250 --> 00:33.500
What if we... had sex
with other people?

00:33.500 --> 00:35.875
Want me to have intercourse
with another woman?

00:35.875 --> 00:39.000
I'm kind of glad
no one else showed up.

00:45.709 --> 00:48.834
- [Adam] Hurry up.
I'll keep watch.
- We're not stealing.

00:48.834 --> 00:51.625
- Then why don't we buy boxes?
- You don't buy boxes.

00:51.625 --> 00:54.458
- Yes, you do, at Box Brothers.
- These are free, OK?

00:54.458 --> 00:57.208
So just put that in your car.

00:57.208 --> 00:59.709
Honey, this stinks.
And there are roach eggs.

00:59.709 --> 01:02.458
I'm not letting you
put roach eggs in my car.

01:02.458 --> 01:04.625
OK, how about those?

01:04.625 --> 01:09.291
- Those are full.
- So we will empty them. Help
me.

01:09.291 --> 01:11.792
- [Adam] This is stealing.
- It's recycling.

01:13.250 --> 01:14.959
[man] What are you doing?

01:16.291 --> 01:21.500
I'm moving... in... with him.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.250
We're getting married.
We need boxes.

01:24.250 --> 01:28.333
- Why don't you just
go to Box Brothers?
- Don't.

01:28.333 --> 01:32.667
Girls, do me a favor, take those
in to your Auntie Nic.

01:32.667 --> 01:36.333
- Hey, thanks, girls.
- You're welcome.

01:36.333 --> 01:38.500
No, it's not too late.

01:38.500 --> 01:40.417
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:40.417 --> 01:43.375
[Angelo] Maybe I should take
the girls for ice cream.

01:43.375 --> 01:46.583
I mean, maybe this whole box
thing is just the tip of the
iceberg.

01:46.583 --> 01:47.917
What iceberg?

01:47.917 --> 01:50.458
[Adam] Maybe we're gonna argue
about a lot of things.

01:50.458 --> 01:54.125
It's just boxes. So, Dave,
are you ready for the pitch
tomorrow?

01:54.125 --> 01:56.959
- Yeah, I'm ready. You ready?
- Yeah, I'm ready.

01:56.959 --> 01:59.917
We have six months of work left
and two months of capital.

01:59.917 --> 02:02.709
We'll be shutting our doors
if we do not make this deal.

02:02.709 --> 02:07.667
I know what you do when you're
psyched. We need sharp, slick,
presentable.

02:07.667 --> 02:11.375
Speaking of presentable...
Hello.

02:11.375 --> 02:15.125
Lisa's Boutique. Isn't that
the girl from the club?

02:15.125 --> 02:17.834
Probably. I think she's
got a clothing line.

02:17.834 --> 02:20.792
- Put that down.
That's Marjorie's.
- This is a sign.

02:20.792 --> 02:23.959
I got a better sign.
She told me not to call.

02:23.959 --> 02:29.875
This is fate, the gods' bride
calling out to you. "Lisa B.
Look at me."

02:29.875 --> 02:32.834
Dave,
do I smell Deena's stuff?

02:32.834 --> 02:38.083
Honey, you're so lucky,
not doing this at 20 like I did.

02:38.083 --> 02:43.083
I mean, you've had time,
you've lived alone, dated
a lot of different guys.

02:43.083 --> 02:46.375
Do you know how many men I have
slept with in my whole life?

02:46.375 --> 02:48.667
- This is gonna depress me.
- Four.

02:48.667 --> 02:51.625
- Oh, my God.
- You can't even count, can you?

02:53.125 --> 02:55.500
I'm sure you're
into the double digits.

02:55.500 --> 02:59.125
I am hovering
on the brink. Nine.

02:59.834 --> 03:03.000
Oh, my God. Am I a slut?

03:03.000 --> 03:06.500
- I don't wanna turn into
a boring married couple.
- Standing right here.

03:06.500 --> 03:09.875
No offense. That argues over
closet space and shower water.

03:09.875 --> 03:11.917
First of all,
little grasshopper,

03:11.917 --> 03:15.000
married people don't just argue,
they have world wars.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.500
Do I really wanna say
goodbye to that moment

03:17.500 --> 03:20.250
where you see a beautiful woman
for the first time?

03:20.250 --> 03:23.417
And just knowing
that could all be yours.

03:23.417 --> 03:27.750
It's a big deal. It's the
first thing you guys do together
as a unit.

03:27.750 --> 03:31.583
Can you not make this
into a big deal when it's
so not a big deal?

03:31.583 --> 03:35.417
Yes, it is. It's a huge deal.
Moving in with your fiancé.
Moving day.

03:35.417 --> 03:38.041
- It's a milestone in your life.
- Look, guys.

03:38.041 --> 03:41.917
It's just every
major event in my life,

03:41.917 --> 03:44.375
whether it's graduating college,

03:44.375 --> 03:46.917
getting into medical school,
moving out here,

03:46.917 --> 03:49.542
my family is just...
They've let me down.

03:49.542 --> 03:52.875
They're all screwed up
and unable to take care
of themselves,

03:52.875 --> 03:56.792
so I just made things not a big
deal. You know, take care of it
myself.

03:56.792 --> 03:58.792
That way I don't get hurt.

04:01.583 --> 04:05.917
Well, it's not gonna be that way
with Adam. You can trust him.

04:05.917 --> 04:08.000
Yeah, I'm starting
to realize that.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.500
[Brian] Look, Adam, just relax.
One step at a time. Tomorrow
first.

04:11.500 --> 04:14.959
- Get the truck over,
you figure it out.
- I can't be here tomorrow.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.959
[Dave] Oh...

04:17.959 --> 04:19.750
...dude.

04:28.542 --> 04:31.083
Sure you don't wanna
pack anything in this box?

04:31.083 --> 04:33.291
[Marjorie]
Yeah, actually...

04:35.458 --> 04:38.041
Why don't you leave
something for the movers?

04:38.041 --> 04:39.917
Mrs. Chin is coming
to do the floors.

04:39.917 --> 04:42.792
If I'm not out by noon, she
won't give me my deposit back.

04:42.792 --> 04:45.500
I was thinking that
you and I could get up early

04:45.500 --> 04:47.917
and move everything out
onto the lawn.

04:49.583 --> 04:52.750
- There's something
I have to tell you.
- Yeah?

04:54.542 --> 04:58.375
I can't be here
for the move tomorrow. Yeah.

04:58.375 --> 05:02.291
This CEO, David Bellows,
is coming in to rehearse
a deposition tomorrow.

05:02.291 --> 05:05.667
He's a huge client, and this
case could get me a partnership.

05:05.667 --> 05:08.291
When did you find out
about this?

05:08.291 --> 05:10.709
- Friday.
- Why are you
telling me this now?

05:10.709 --> 05:13.834
So we wouldn't have the argument
we're about to have.

05:13.834 --> 05:17.291
Honey, I am sorry.
I am so sorry. I know.

05:17.291 --> 05:19.917
- [Marjorie] It's just,
I kind of...
- Kind of what?

05:22.792 --> 05:26.208
You know what? Nothing. It's not
a big deal. I can handle it.

05:26.208 --> 05:29.792
You go to work, get your
partnership. I can take care
of everything.

05:31.959 --> 05:36.208
Have I told you
that you are absolutely stellar?

05:37.625 --> 05:39.208
You can tell me again.

05:44.834 --> 05:47.166
Geneva, stop throwing
cereal at the baby.

05:47.166 --> 05:49.834
She likes it.

05:49.834 --> 05:53.834
- [Deena] You gonna eat?
- Which landscape looks better?

05:53.834 --> 05:57.750
- Come here, come here.
- [Geneva] Larissa,
Eat your cereal.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.458
You got this one or that one.

06:00.458 --> 06:05.458
Why don't you throw in some
helicopters and airplanes
and fill up the sky?

06:05.458 --> 06:07.458
Do you even know
what the game's about?

06:07.458 --> 06:10.834
People would think it's
a war game with helicopters
and airplanes.

06:10.834 --> 06:14.458
- Never mind.
- I need you to take
Geneva to school.

06:14.458 --> 06:18.458
- I'm keeping Larissa home.
- Why? She doesn't look sick.

06:18.458 --> 06:22.709
OK. Come on, Geneva.
You're with me. Let's go.

06:22.709 --> 06:27.375
Let's go, honey. Here's your
lunch. Have a good day
at school, OK?

06:27.375 --> 06:29.583
- OK.
- OK, let's go.

06:29.583 --> 06:32.875
Good luck with the presentation.
Call me when you're done.

06:32.875 --> 06:35.000
- You're not coming.
- OK, I'm coming.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.208
- I will call you. Promise.
- Come on!

06:37.208 --> 06:40.041
All right. You're just like
your mother. Let's go.

06:45.041 --> 06:47.166
[baby coos]

06:59.750 --> 07:02.083
Ciao, bella. I'm here
to help you move.

07:02.083 --> 07:06.750
Only until this afternoon.
I have an audition for
something called Mr. Clean.

07:06.750 --> 07:09.834
Look, honey.
Angelo came to help move.

07:09.834 --> 07:13.834
Thanks, man.
One of those a mocha?

07:13.834 --> 07:16.834
I made it. Brian? Bri?

07:16.834 --> 07:19.041
You're late.
We said we'd do a dry run.

07:19.041 --> 07:21.583
Three kids, two schools,
one sick. Do the math.

07:21.583 --> 07:24.417
You have to wire this.
I have no clue what I'm doing.

07:26.083 --> 07:28.750
- You gotta be kidding me.
- You said presentable.

07:28.750 --> 07:30.959
These are my corporate
zombie clothes.

07:30.959 --> 07:34.500
You're supposed to look
creative. T-shirt, ripped jeans.

07:34.500 --> 07:36.750
Untuck yours.
Goes with your hippie hair.

07:36.750 --> 07:39.291
- I don't have hippie hair.
- Sorry. Girl hair.

07:39.291 --> 07:41.917
- Seriously, change.
- I ain't changing.

07:50.291 --> 07:53.000
Can we just practice the pitch?
Thank you.

07:53.000 --> 07:56.458
The movers will be here at nine.
Here's their number, contract.

07:56.458 --> 08:01.041
Have them load the boxes
first and the furniture last.
Those lamps stay here.

08:01.041 --> 08:04.667
- I got those at a flea market.
- Yeah, key word being "flea."

08:04.667 --> 08:08.500
- I don't know about
these ex-con movers.
- They're supposed to be good.

08:08.500 --> 08:12.000
It's like a porn movie. My hot
fiancée and the ex-con movers.

08:12.000 --> 08:14.834
Don't worry. I will
take care of your fiancée.

08:14.834 --> 08:17.291
The whole thing's
like a porn movie.

08:17.291 --> 08:19.709
[phone ringing]

08:24.834 --> 08:27.333
- What do you have
in your mouth?
- Nothing.

08:28.291 --> 08:30.500
Spit it out.

08:30.500 --> 08:33.542
[Deena on machine]
You've reached the Grecos.
Leave a message.

08:33.542 --> 08:35.500
You can't eat chocolate
if you're sick.

08:35.500 --> 08:39.125
[man] Hey, Deena.
It's Richard.

08:39.125 --> 08:44.166
I was calling to see if you
were home. I'm sitting here
writing, and...

08:44.166 --> 08:47.083
- Yes, Richard. Hey, I'm here.
- Hey.

08:47.083 --> 08:50.834
- Uh, what are you doing?
- I'm just hanging out
with Larissa.

08:50.834 --> 08:53.542
'Cause this morning
I thought, maybe, she was sick,

08:53.542 --> 08:57.917
but I just caught her with
a mouthful of chocolate, so...

08:57.917 --> 09:00.458
That would explain
why I didn't see you today.

09:00.458 --> 09:03.875
- Yeah. What are you doing?
- Writing, or trying to.

09:03.875 --> 09:05.959
Anyway,
I'm totally blocked.

09:05.959 --> 09:09.709
Hey, which character name
do you like better, Karin
or Beth?

09:09.709 --> 09:12.041
Well, what's she like?

09:12.041 --> 09:15.750
Thirty, single. She lives
in Montana, is obsessed
with fishing.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.083
I think you should
name her Rhiannon,

09:18.083 --> 09:22.750
because her mother really liked
that Fleetwood Mac album

09:22.750 --> 09:25.709
and she listened to it
the whole time she was pregnant.

09:25.709 --> 09:28.667
- I love that.
- Really?

09:28.667 --> 09:30.667
Yeah, really.

09:31.875 --> 09:35.709
Hey, can I see you today?

09:37.208 --> 09:40.291
How about the park?
One o'clock?

09:40.291 --> 09:43.709
- Deena?
- OK.

09:44.792 --> 09:47.750
Am I misreading this?

09:47.750 --> 09:51.041
It's just, the other night
when we went out for pizza,

09:51.041 --> 09:53.542
it seemed like
there might be something.

09:55.583 --> 09:59.583
I will see you
at the park. Yeah.

10:07.500 --> 10:10.041
When you get to concept,
do that thing with the pen.

10:10.041 --> 10:12.417
- What?
- That thing you do
when you're nervous.

10:12.417 --> 10:14.583
That twirl click.
Then I'll know to wrap up.

10:14.583 --> 10:17.417
Then close with, "Rule
your fantasy." It's strong.

10:17.417 --> 10:19.583
I like mine.
"Control your fantasy."

10:19.583 --> 10:21.834
No, dude. I'm telling you,
do "rule."

10:23.417 --> 10:25.542
Do you really think
that label was a sign?

10:26.458 --> 10:27.917
What?

10:27.917 --> 10:31.125
Lisa B. The label. Maybe it was
a sign, I should go after her.

10:31.125 --> 10:36.709
Please, OK? This meeting could
define the rest of your life
and mine.

10:36.709 --> 10:41.125
Focus on this. After, you know,
we can talk about girls.

10:41.125 --> 10:44.458
- Maybe you could
find one for me.
- You're still doing that?

10:44.458 --> 10:47.208
- What, the open marriage?
- Yeah.

10:47.208 --> 10:50.458
Yeah. Look, dude, teenage boys
have more sex than me.

10:50.458 --> 10:53.125
My wife is telling me
to find someone to sleep with.

10:53.125 --> 10:55.000
What guy is not
gonna wanna do that?

10:55.750 --> 10:56.959
[knocking]

10:56.959 --> 10:57.959
They're here.

10:58.917 --> 11:00.667
[both exhale deeply]

11:00.667 --> 11:03.417
- Rule your fantasy.
- Control your fantasy.

11:03.417 --> 11:05.792
Dave Greco.
This is Brian Davis, my partner.

11:05.792 --> 11:08.333
- Nice to meet you.
- Brian.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.417
- Hi. Suzanne.
- Dave.

11:10.417 --> 11:12.834
I know.
Nice to meet you. I'm a big fan.

11:12.834 --> 11:15.834
- Thanks.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

11:15.834 --> 11:17.959
Nice to meet you.

11:19.417 --> 11:21.625
- Hey, Jimmy.
- Jimmy, Jim, Jim.

11:25.834 --> 11:28.959
- [groans]
- [phone ringing]

11:33.542 --> 11:36.917
- Hello.
- We're on our way right now.

11:36.917 --> 11:40.000
- No, you guys
are already an hour late.
- Yeah, yeah.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.709
Well, how are you gonna
get the truck packed in time?

11:43.709 --> 11:45.291
Please come
as soon as you can.

11:45.875 --> 11:47.375
Ah.

11:47.375 --> 11:50.709
Don't worry.
Everything will be fine, OK?

11:50.709 --> 11:53.959
The game is free-roaming
and mission-based,

11:53.959 --> 11:56.291
but the progress
you make during the day,

11:56.291 --> 11:59.458
building your home, your job,
providing for your family,

11:59.458 --> 12:02.166
all comes
under attack at night.

12:02.166 --> 12:06.041
The game itself is a spectacle,
but our technology makes it
personal.

12:06.041 --> 12:09.375
OK, we're in a jam.
We need a volunteer.

12:09.375 --> 12:11.792
- What do I have to do?
- Just smile.

12:11.792 --> 12:14.041
OK, Suzanne.

12:14.041 --> 12:18.709
Nice. Now,
keep your eye on the game.

12:25.875 --> 12:29.208
- No way.
- We have 30
different character modes.

12:29.208 --> 12:32.083
I see you as a cave girl
with a Stegosaurus.

12:32.083 --> 12:35.250
No, no, no. I'm thinking space
chick with a rocket ship.

12:35.250 --> 12:37.083
Mm.

12:37.083 --> 12:41.417
- Sorry. Super spy,
on a hot bike.
- I like that.

12:42.875 --> 12:48.625
In fact, that is one
of our plug-ins. Enjoy.

13:01.583 --> 13:05.083
Did you and Nicole go see that
fertility doctor I recommended?

13:05.083 --> 13:07.625
- Yes, we did.
- And?

13:07.625 --> 13:10.542
And maybe
we'll keep trying,

13:10.542 --> 13:13.417
see if we can get pregnant
in the natural way.

13:13.417 --> 13:16.959
I don't want Nicole to have
shots or be implanted.
It's too much.

13:16.959 --> 13:19.000
- And Nicole?
- She thinks the same.

13:19.000 --> 13:21.125
We don't want
to see any more doctors.

13:21.125 --> 13:25.166
The first thing I would
recommend is ovulation
stimulation.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.792
A typical regimen involves
seven to twelve days of
injections,

13:28.792 --> 13:33.375
during which we'll monitor you
with blood tests and pelvic
sonograms.

13:33.375 --> 13:36.458
- Are there any side effects?
- Gobs. Yeah.

13:36.458 --> 13:39.500
Hot flashes,
nausea, dry mouth,

13:39.500 --> 13:42.333
mood swings,
blurred vision, weight gain.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.125
- Weight gain?
- Yeah.

13:45.959 --> 13:47.625
You sure
you're ready for this?

13:49.750 --> 13:53.041
- Absolutely. I wanna go for it.
- And Angelo too?

13:53.041 --> 13:55.417
Yes. Of course.

13:55.417 --> 13:57.792
Larissa,
don't you wanna go to the park?

13:57.792 --> 14:00.333
I don't feel good.

14:00.333 --> 14:03.667
- Where's Larissa?
- Mommy, I'm four.

14:03.667 --> 14:08.250
Honey, listen, Mary's gonna be
there, and that fresh air is
gonna feel good.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.583
If you don't feel better,
we'll come back.

14:10.583 --> 14:12.333
- Deal.
- OK.

14:13.834 --> 14:19.208
Oh, my. Sweetie,
I am sorry you're sick.

14:20.625 --> 14:24.125
Our artists have created 19
different fully modeled levels.

14:25.500 --> 14:27.959
Specs of which
are in your take-home packets,

14:27.959 --> 14:30.125
also available
in hardcover.

14:31.875 --> 14:35.125
One final image.
A billboard at E3, 50 feet tall.

14:35.125 --> 14:38.125
"This summer from
Leviathan Gaming and Zap Monkey:

14:38.125 --> 14:42.000
Vision State.
Control your fantasy."

14:47.208 --> 14:50.458
Groundbreaking presentation.
The future of gaming.

14:50.458 --> 14:52.709
- My grandma thinks so.
- We're hoping.

14:52.709 --> 14:55.542
- Why don't we talk
this afternoon?
- Perfect.

14:55.542 --> 14:57.875
It was great
to have you guys in.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.709
- That was fantastic.
- Oh, yeah? Thanks.

15:01.709 --> 15:05.208
- I wanna play again.
- Well, that's the cool part
about it.

15:05.208 --> 15:09.417
It's never the same game twice.
It's really hard to get good
at it.

15:09.417 --> 15:12.875
You know, I used to kill
at Throttle Autobahn.

15:12.875 --> 15:14.917
- You played Throttle?
- All the time.

15:14.917 --> 15:18.125
- I wondered
what genius made that up.
- Oh, no, you didn't.

15:18.125 --> 15:21.083
I did. And now I know.

15:25.583 --> 15:26.792
Well, I'll see you.

15:29.083 --> 15:30.458
It's gonna happen.

15:38.291 --> 15:40.625
- Thank you.
- See you guys later.

15:56.250 --> 15:59.917
Get him to rehearse the
deposition. No one's been
able to do it yet.

15:59.917 --> 16:02.667
Don't badger, challenge him
or disagree with him.

16:02.667 --> 16:06.709
This company brings in $3
million a year. They're
our biggest clients.

16:06.709 --> 16:11.083
He's hated every associate
we've sent to him. You're
my last hope.

16:11.083 --> 16:14.291
- Get it?
- Got it.

16:20.834 --> 16:22.500
[shouting in Italian]

16:22.500 --> 16:23.500
No, no.

16:25.125 --> 16:27.667
[Marjorie giggles, squeals]

16:27.667 --> 16:29.875
- Wait. No, no, no.
- Goal, goal, goal!

16:29.875 --> 16:32.500
- Offsides. Offsides.
- What do you mean, offsides?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.834
[Phone ringing]

16:33.834 --> 16:36.333
How can it be offsides?
It's just one person.

16:36.333 --> 16:39.500
Where is it? Where's the phone?
Angelo, where's the phone?

16:41.250 --> 16:42.959
- It's impossible.
- Hello.

16:42.959 --> 16:45.333
- Ma'am, we're gonna
be there tomorrow.
- No.

16:45.333 --> 16:50.375
It is not OK if you come
tomorrow. I don't care
if your other job ran late.

16:50.375 --> 16:52.834
My stuff is gonna be thrown
onto the street.

16:52.834 --> 16:55.750
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Hello? Hello?

16:57.417 --> 17:01.166
- They're not coming.
- Oh, my God.
You should call Adam.

17:01.166 --> 17:03.041
He's got
an important day today.

17:03.041 --> 17:06.166
Besides, I want him to know
that I can handle it.

17:06.166 --> 17:07.750
[Angelo speaking Italian]

17:07.750 --> 17:09.709
Is that her?

17:09.709 --> 17:11.667
That's her.

17:11.667 --> 17:15.834
- Hi, Mrs. Chin.
- Everything better
be clean, Marjorie.

17:15.834 --> 17:17.625
Or no deposit for you.

17:20.667 --> 17:23.125
- What are you doing?
- Making sure it works.

17:23.125 --> 17:26.417
- That could be the second
they call.
- Let's take a breather.

17:26.417 --> 17:29.709
What are we so stressed out
about? They're gonna call.

17:29.709 --> 17:31.458
- Are they?
- Yes.

17:31.458 --> 17:35.041
He said he'd call this
afternoon. Break it down.
After noon.

17:35.041 --> 17:39.083
- It's after noon.
- OK, calm down.
It's gonna happen.

17:39.083 --> 17:42.542
OK? It's fate.
I know it's gonna happen.

17:42.542 --> 17:46.375
Suzanne looks just like the girl
I did in the mock-ups three
months ago.

17:47.959 --> 17:49.542
- A little.
- A lot.

17:49.542 --> 17:51.208
What bigger sign
do you need, Bri?

17:51.208 --> 17:53.834
Stop with the signs.
There's no signs.

17:53.834 --> 17:56.458
There's only results.
And no phone calls.

17:56.458 --> 18:00.375
You need to learn to believe
in signs. These signs say
it's gonna happen.

18:00.375 --> 18:01.917
- You promise?
- I promise.

18:01.917 --> 18:06.166
- If you say it's gonna happen,
then it better happen.
- Fine.

18:06.166 --> 18:08.417
[answering machine]
Leave a message.

18:08.417 --> 18:13.041
Richard,
it's Deena. Greco.

18:13.041 --> 18:16.750
Um, I'm sorry. We can't make it
to the park this afternoon.

18:16.750 --> 18:19.083
Larissa threw up.

18:19.083 --> 18:24.709
But maybe we could do it
again sometime, if you want.

18:24.709 --> 18:26.709
OK, bye.

18:28.417 --> 18:30.959
- Does that feel better,
sweetie?
- Yes, Mommy.

18:30.959 --> 18:32.583
Would you like
to watch a show?

18:32.583 --> 18:33.834
- Yeah.
- OK.

18:35.208 --> 18:36.709
[crying on TV]

18:40.959 --> 18:44.083
- Howdy, ma'am.
- [phone ringing]

18:44.083 --> 18:46.208
- Hey, that was fast.
- What was fast?

18:46.208 --> 18:49.291
Oh! Hey, Nic. Nothing.

18:49.291 --> 18:53.917
I'm at my doctor's office
and all the little fetuses
are staring at me.

18:53.917 --> 18:55.000
Can I come over?

18:56.667 --> 19:00.959
Oh, yeah, sure.
Come on over.

19:08.375 --> 19:10.542
[phone rings]

19:10.542 --> 19:13.625
- No one touches it.
- Everybody, I need silence.

19:13.625 --> 19:16.458
No, it should sound busy.
Life goes on without them.

19:16.458 --> 19:19.291
- Right, right.
Everybody, be busy.
- Busy, busy.

19:19.291 --> 19:22.417
Don't say,
"Zap Monkey." Say, "Hello."

19:22.417 --> 19:26.333
No, say, "Brian here."
No, say, "This is Brian."

19:26.333 --> 19:28.083
- Yeah.
- No, sound casual.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.667
- We're just at work.
It's no big deal.
- I got it.

19:30.667 --> 19:33.542
- This is Bri.
- Not like that.

19:33.542 --> 19:35.834
- Brian, it's Marjorie.
- Marjorie?

19:35.834 --> 19:39.834
Do you remember the guys we met
that time that thing didn't fit
in your car?

19:39.834 --> 19:42.333
- Karl and Ernesto.
- Do you have their number?

19:42.333 --> 19:45.458
- We need their number.
- Something wrong?
You need help?

19:45.458 --> 19:48.000
The movers didn't show,
and Mrs. Chin is here,

19:48.000 --> 19:51.333
and I have to go on call for
72 hours, so this has to happen
today.

19:51.333 --> 19:53.709
- I have an audition.
- You have their number?

19:53.709 --> 19:56.208
I'll call them,
but Ernesto has back spasms.

19:56.208 --> 20:01.000
- OK, just...
Can you come over, then?
- Yeah, I'll see you in a few.

20:03.709 --> 20:05.834
- What?
- Really?

20:05.834 --> 20:09.417
- We gonna stare
at the phone all day?
- Why can't Adam help her?

20:10.250 --> 20:11.291
[door opens]

20:12.542 --> 20:14.375
Adam Hillman
was instrumental

20:14.375 --> 20:17.041
in our defense of Frank/Solomon
Pharmaceuticals.

20:17.041 --> 20:19.542
- I asked for a shark.
- This is your man.

20:19.542 --> 20:23.500
- Looks more like a guppy.
- Work with him.
You'll like him.

20:23.500 --> 20:25.583
I better,
or I'm finding another firm.

20:33.333 --> 20:36.000
[speaks Italian]

20:38.959 --> 20:41.250
Thanks, you guys.
You saved my life.

20:41.250 --> 20:45.375
Hey, what were we doing anyway?
Sitting around waiting for a
phone call?

20:45.375 --> 20:49.041
Yeah. Going crazy
waiting for this phone call.

20:49.041 --> 20:52.417
- Is your phone on?
- Yep, it's right here.
Is yours?

20:52.417 --> 20:56.166
- Yeah. I put it over there.
- We'll never hear it
from over there.

20:56.166 --> 20:59.125
- We'll hear it in your pocket?
- It's not over there.

20:59.125 --> 21:02.834
You know how many times I call
you? I say, "Is your phone on?"

21:02.834 --> 21:05.125
I have it on vibrate, OK?

21:05.125 --> 21:08.125
Ernesto and I bicker
all the time too.

21:11.125 --> 21:13.667
- You like that, sweetie?
- [baby fusses]

21:13.667 --> 21:15.917
I'm starved.

21:15.917 --> 21:17.834
What is this stuff?

21:17.834 --> 21:20.667
Uh, turkey purée.

21:23.542 --> 21:27.000
This is what I need.
Meat in jars.

21:27.000 --> 21:29.500
I could sip it through a straw
while I'm driving.

21:29.500 --> 21:31.458
[chuckles]

21:31.458 --> 21:34.959
So what happened
at the doctor's office?

21:36.625 --> 21:40.083
Ovulation, hot flashes,
dry mouth, weight gain.

21:40.083 --> 21:43.959
I mean, it all takes so long.
I just wanted to scream at
the doctor,

21:43.959 --> 21:48.291
"Can you just get me pregnant?
Can someone please get me
pregnant?"

21:49.375 --> 21:51.458
Look at her.
You're so lucky.

21:51.458 --> 21:55.625
I know. But, Nic,
it's not all happy-happy.

21:55.625 --> 21:59.625
You know, it's hard. It is
the hardest job in the world.

21:59.625 --> 22:04.083
You're never, ever off. I mean,
just to have one minute to
myself...

22:04.083 --> 22:07.041
You'll have minutes.
You'll have tons of minutes.

22:07.041 --> 22:10.041
Your kids'll be grown and you'll
still be sexy as hell.

22:10.041 --> 22:14.458
You'll take trips to Greece
and I'll be 60 with a teenager
who hates my guts

22:14.458 --> 22:17.083
and tells his friends
I'm his grandmother.

22:17.083 --> 22:20.750
Maybe I should just forget it.
Accept defeat gracefully for
once.

22:20.750 --> 22:23.333
Honey, it isn't defeat.
It's just life.

22:23.333 --> 22:27.000
You can't say
you regret anything you've done.

22:27.000 --> 22:29.041
You did everything
you wanted to do.

22:29.041 --> 22:31.208
Haven't you done
everything you wanted to?

22:31.917 --> 22:34.625
[baby coos]

22:34.625 --> 22:40.625
In the third quarter of that
year, our profits soared
to 6.4 million.

22:40.625 --> 22:43.667
- Can you back that up
with paper?
- Whose side are you on?

22:43.667 --> 22:46.333
I just wanna be prepared
for whatever they ask us.

22:46.333 --> 22:49.583
Are you taking the stand?
If you don't believe in my case...

22:49.583 --> 22:54.083
Sir, I believe in it
whole-heartedly. I wanna protect
you from any slip-ups.

22:54.083 --> 22:56.917
Why would I slip up?
Don't think I know my business?

22:56.917 --> 22:59.375
Of course you do.
Better than anybody.

22:59.375 --> 23:02.875
OK, let's go over
those real-estate values again.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.709
- That's not necessary.
- Well, I have to disagree.

23:05.709 --> 23:09.875
You go ahead.
I'll just get another lawyer.

23:09.875 --> 23:12.917
OK. Go.

23:12.917 --> 23:16.125
Find somebody else. But let me
give you one last piece of
advice.

23:16.125 --> 23:18.709
Save your money,
pocket your $800 an hour

23:18.709 --> 23:21.417
and work your deposition
with your driver, pool boy,

23:21.417 --> 23:24.417
woman who presses your shirts.
Someone who won't say boo.

23:24.417 --> 23:27.542
You have zero interest in
hearing how this should be done,

23:27.542 --> 23:32.083
but your problem
isn't your lawyer, it's you.

23:39.333 --> 23:41.667
She is never gonna give me
my deposit back.

23:41.667 --> 23:45.291
Yes, she will. She's not gonna
beat us. We're not gonna let
her.

23:47.417 --> 23:52.125
Well, Marjorie, I guess I have
to give you your deposit back.

23:52.125 --> 23:55.834
Mrs. Chin, I just wanted
to thank you for letting
Marjorie break her lease.

23:55.834 --> 23:57.667
That shows a lot
of compassion.

23:57.667 --> 24:01.166
You have very nice manners,
for a man.

24:01.166 --> 24:04.083
Hey, how long
have you owned the property?

24:04.083 --> 24:08.583
Not too long. My husband makes
a lot of money in donut shops.

24:08.583 --> 24:11.834
You know Hello Donut
on Fairfax?

24:11.834 --> 24:15.583
- I love Hello Donut.
- That's us.

24:15.583 --> 24:18.834
- Also Goodbye Donut
on Wilshire.
- I'll have to try that.

24:18.834 --> 24:23.792
Don't bother. My brother-in-law
runs it. It's bad. Greasy.

24:25.375 --> 24:28.166
OK, listen,
I gotta go check on the truck.

24:30.375 --> 24:33.041
That's a very nice boy
you marry, Marjorie.

24:33.041 --> 24:35.917
- He... Thank you.
- Polite.

24:36.959 --> 24:40.709
And an ass
like a hard-boiled egg.

24:40.709 --> 24:43.041
You hang onto him.

24:44.208 --> 24:45.875
[phone ringing]

24:47.125 --> 24:48.375
Hello.

24:48.375 --> 24:50.291
- Deena.
- Hey, Richard.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.959
- How's Larissa?
- She's much better, thank you.

24:52.959 --> 24:57.250
Good. Can I bring you anything?
Medicine, lunch, a couple
of tallboys?

24:58.458 --> 25:01.166
How about
a million bucks and a Slurpee?

25:01.166 --> 25:03.875
The Slurpee I can do.
Not sure about the other one.

25:03.875 --> 25:08.000
- But I would like to see you.
- Well, I have
to pick up Geneva.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.375
- Maybe we could...
- Tim's got baseball.

25:10.375 --> 25:13.250
- After that?
- I bring the kids
back to their mom's.

25:13.250 --> 25:15.667
Maybe after that? Coffee?

25:15.667 --> 25:18.875
Oh. I don't have a sitter.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.250
[sighing] Maybe this whole thing
is just too complicated.

25:22.250 --> 25:24.583
No. Aroma at six.

25:24.583 --> 25:27.500
- I will figure
something out. OK?
- OK.

25:27.500 --> 25:30.000
- See you then.
- Aroma at six. Bye.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.000
Bye.

25:35.959 --> 25:39.166
[Marjorie] OK, Angelo, can you
take your car? I'll take mine.

25:39.166 --> 25:43.625
Dave, you mind going in the
truck with the guys? Brian,
you take your car.

25:43.625 --> 25:46.041
- Bye, Mrs. Chin.
- [groans]

25:47.875 --> 25:52.500
[engine revving, stalling]

25:56.500 --> 25:58.750
How many times
did you visit the site?

25:58.750 --> 26:00.417
Three times
after the incident.

26:00.417 --> 26:01.959
Date?

26:01.959 --> 26:05.208
Three times
since the incident on June 24th.

26:05.208 --> 26:08.917
- Good. Specific.
- I gotta tell you,
you're not bad.

26:08.917 --> 26:11.375
Your partners were right.
You got a big future.

26:13.375 --> 26:15.959
If you don't mind me asking,
Mr. Bellows,

26:15.959 --> 26:19.875
you just don't trip and fall
onto the cover of Fortune
magazine.

26:19.875 --> 26:22.709
So how'd you get into this mess
in the first place?

26:22.709 --> 26:25.417
Well,
you know how they say

26:25.417 --> 26:29.041
when you divorce your wife,
she takes half?

26:29.041 --> 26:34.500
- Well, it's actually more,
about 56%.
- Wow.

26:34.500 --> 26:39.750
Do yourself a favor.
Never, ever get married.

26:52.834 --> 26:55.125
You think you can fix it,
or you can fix it?

26:55.125 --> 26:58.166
- I can fix it.
- Don't get your hands dirty.

26:58.834 --> 27:00.500
[groans]

27:00.500 --> 27:03.208
- They're gonna call, Dave.
- I don't know.

27:03.208 --> 27:05.792
Truck breaking down,
it's not a good sign.

27:05.792 --> 27:08.792
Sorry, but I must leave now.
I have to go to my audition.

27:08.792 --> 27:11.417
- What's it for?
- Mr. Clean.

27:11.417 --> 27:14.375
- You won't get that.
- Why not? I'm clean.

27:14.375 --> 27:18.667
No, Ange, Mr. Clean is bald.
He's got an earring and muscles.
He's like a pirate.

27:18.667 --> 27:21.959
Maybe they wanna go in a
different direction. Why not?

27:21.959 --> 27:25.041
They're just not. This whole
thing is a sign, a bad sign.

27:25.041 --> 27:27.625
We don't get the call,
you don't get Mr. Clean,

27:27.625 --> 27:29.667
and this truck
is never gonna start.

27:29.667 --> 27:32.583
Oh, God, I just hate signs.
I do. I hate 'em.

27:32.583 --> 27:34.834
[truck starts]

27:34.834 --> 27:39.291
- Maybe our luck just changed.
- How about that sign, Mr.
Negative?

27:39.291 --> 27:43.041
- Mr. Clean, here I come.
- Yeah, OK. Good luck with that.

27:43.041 --> 27:46.792
I don't get it. You meant to
break up with her and you ended
up proposing.

27:46.792 --> 27:51.667
- Yeah, something like that.
- Listen, Guppy,
it is a mistake.

27:51.667 --> 27:56.750
You're a young man, easily ten
years and hundreds of thousands
of dollars

27:56.750 --> 28:00.000
of non-divisible assets away
from tying the knot.

28:00.000 --> 28:02.333
You don't
know Marjorie, OK?

28:02.333 --> 28:06.333
If you knew there was a 50%
chance of a car blowing up,

28:06.333 --> 28:08.166
would you still
drive one off the lot?

28:09.500 --> 28:11.542
I didn't think so.

28:11.542 --> 28:17.208
We'll keep working on this
deposition, but you have got
to learn,

28:17.208 --> 28:20.500
somewhere out there, there
is a trophy wife waiting for you

28:20.500 --> 28:23.000
who has not entered
the fifth grade.

28:27.750 --> 28:29.542
[Brian]
Maybe we should've...

28:29.542 --> 28:33.041
They're not gonna call us
because we looked like Bobbsey
Twins.

28:33.041 --> 28:36.375
The girl, she could have been
the boss's girl.

28:36.375 --> 28:38.875
He's nailing her
and you're flirting with her.

28:38.875 --> 28:42.291
- Should've never
said "control."
- I knew you'd blame me.

28:42.291 --> 28:46.375
- If you'd said "rule",
we'd be fine.
- "It's available in hardcover?"

28:47.625 --> 28:50.083
- See you, Bri.
- I can't carry this by myself.

28:50.083 --> 28:53.083
It's a metaphor, dude.
Deal with it.

28:56.208 --> 28:59.709
OK, so no television
till after six for the girls.

28:59.709 --> 29:02.333
If Carrie gets fussy,
there's a bottle in there.

29:02.333 --> 29:05.250
- OK, they're upstairs.
Thanks, sweetie.
- See you later.

29:06.542 --> 29:08.542
OK.

29:17.834 --> 29:19.458
Hi.

29:20.458 --> 29:22.250
What's up?

29:23.750 --> 29:28.291
What am I doing? I spent all
this time, years, on this game.

29:28.291 --> 29:31.667
How arrogant am I to just
assume that we'd sell it?

29:33.291 --> 29:36.250
Come on, honey.
It's just one setback.

29:36.250 --> 29:40.250
If they can't realize how great
the game is, someone else will.

29:45.250 --> 29:47.417
Deena, you know what?

29:47.417 --> 29:52.291
You deserve... You deserve
so much more than this tiny
old house.

29:52.291 --> 29:55.500
- I love this house.
- You do everything around here.

29:55.500 --> 29:58.291
And what do I do? I sit around,
I play video games.

29:58.291 --> 30:01.291
Honey,
that's just who you are.

30:01.291 --> 30:03.834
It's your brain.

30:03.834 --> 30:07.625
I love your brain.
It's different. It's wonderful.

30:07.625 --> 30:11.542
I think you could do anything
you wanted to with that brain
of yours.

30:11.542 --> 30:14.875
Except get you a house with more
than one bathroom for five
people.

30:18.959 --> 30:23.834
Do you wanna know what
my favorite time in
our marriage was?

30:23.834 --> 30:25.083
Hm.

30:27.000 --> 30:32.500
We were down to our last 20
bucks and it was our third-year
anniversary.

30:32.500 --> 30:36.417
So we just stayed home, and
we didn't even have a coupon,

30:36.417 --> 30:41.208
but you ordered a pizza with
eight toppings and cheesy bread.

30:41.208 --> 30:42.625
Cheesy bread.

30:42.625 --> 30:46.208
When the delivery guy came,
you handed him the 20

30:46.208 --> 30:48.667
and you told him
to keep the change.

30:51.166 --> 30:54.333
That was
my favorite time ever.

30:58.333 --> 31:01.166
Might have been because
we were baked out of our minds.

31:03.667 --> 31:09.458
Honey, the point is, you married
a very low-rent chick.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.375
[phone ringing]

31:22.542 --> 31:25.250
- You gonna get that?
- Nope.

31:27.542 --> 31:29.542
It's not important.

31:40.917 --> 31:42.250
[Angelo] How was work?

31:43.500 --> 31:46.375
- I didn't go to work.
- Why? Are you sick?

31:46.375 --> 31:49.583
- We should get you soup.
- No, I went to see Dr. Oscar.

31:51.291 --> 31:55.709
Oh. I thought we said we weren't
going to any more doctors.

31:55.709 --> 31:57.750
No, Angelo, you said that.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.917
And Dr. Oscar says that my
chances of getting pregnant,

32:00.917 --> 32:06.417
even using modern medicine,
are about five percent.

32:06.417 --> 32:10.667
Amore, we have sex,
we see if we make a baby.

32:10.667 --> 32:13.458
- This has worked for years.
- That's not what we do.

32:13.458 --> 32:17.083
We attack it, head on. Five
percent? Fine. I can beat
those odds.

32:17.083 --> 32:20.500
- We start
with ovulation induction.
- What is that?

32:20.500 --> 32:23.166
I give myself some shots,
I make a lot of eggs,

32:23.166 --> 32:25.750
then they tell us
exactly when we can have sex,

32:25.750 --> 32:27.917
then maybe
I'll get pregnant.

32:27.917 --> 32:30.333
- You always do this.
- What?

32:30.333 --> 32:32.792
You make decisions for us,
without telling me.

32:34.417 --> 32:37.792
- Why do I have to tell you?
- Because I'm your husband.

32:39.959 --> 32:41.417
I have a choice in this.

32:43.417 --> 32:46.792
OK. What is your choice?

32:48.667 --> 32:53.792
If this is the way it has to be,
I don't want to have a baby at
all.

32:56.625 --> 33:00.375
[Brian] Hey, I remember these.
I can't believe you still have
'em.

33:00.375 --> 33:04.208
- You took me
to that flea market.
- No, you took me.

33:04.208 --> 33:07.417
I wanted the lamps and I
couldn't bargain the guy down,

33:07.417 --> 33:10.959
so you ended up giving him
your shoes so I could get them.

33:10.959 --> 33:13.500
That guy freaked me out.
He really wanted my shoes.

33:15.375 --> 33:19.875
This was supposed to be the big
first day of Adam and me as
a real couple,

33:19.875 --> 33:22.917
and I ended up
spending the whole day with you.

33:26.834 --> 33:29.333
Well, I gotta go.

33:29.333 --> 33:32.625
- OK. Thank you, Brian.
- Yeah.

33:34.250 --> 33:37.083
[♪♪]

33:43.208 --> 33:44.875
We have to get past this.

33:45.583 --> 33:47.834
I'm past it.

33:49.583 --> 33:53.834
We've hugged a thousand times.
We have to figure out how to
do this without...

33:57.500 --> 34:02.083
I am marrying your best friend.
We're gonna be hugging for 50
years.

34:02.083 --> 34:03.375
Yeah, I know.

34:09.250 --> 34:12.208
- Wanna stay for dinner?
Adam would...
- No.

34:14.625 --> 34:18.250
- I'm gonna go.
- OK.

34:35.166 --> 34:37.834
[♪♪]

34:57.083 --> 35:00.083
- Lisa B.
- Hi.

35:01.583 --> 35:03.917
This is...

35:03.917 --> 35:05.583
- Weird.
- Weird.

35:07.875 --> 35:10.417
Oh, meter maid. Um...

35:10.417 --> 35:12.417
- You need a quarter?
- You got two?

35:12.417 --> 35:15.375
Yeah. Um...

35:15.375 --> 35:16.417
- There.
- Thanks.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.792
Sure.

35:19.208 --> 35:21.667
- Is this your car?
- Neither one of 'em are mine.

35:21.667 --> 35:23.834
But, you know,
nobody likes to get a ticket.

35:48.375 --> 35:50.041
Hi.

35:50.041 --> 35:53.291
Hi, honey. I'm home.

35:55.000 --> 35:59.792
- Place looks amazing.
- I'm making dinner.
Is that too wifey?

35:59.792 --> 36:04.166
No. I brought you some pizza.
I thought you might need some
food.

36:04.166 --> 36:08.166
- Thank you.
- It's the least I can do.

36:08.166 --> 36:13.834
- How did your deposition go?
- Oh. You know what?
It was tough.

36:13.834 --> 36:17.667
It was good tough,
but tough.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.792
And then it got
kind of weird.

36:19.792 --> 36:22.333
He tried to pitch me
on how I shouldn't get married.

36:23.750 --> 36:27.417
- Oh.
- Yeah, and it was exhausting.

36:27.417 --> 36:31.375
I was driving
home thinking,

36:31.375 --> 36:34.959
"I wish I was gonna
be alone tonight."

36:35.959 --> 36:38.000
And I walked in,

36:38.000 --> 36:42.625
and when I saw you,

36:42.625 --> 36:46.166
I was so glad
you were here, really.

36:46.166 --> 36:49.333
I mean, this guy is wrong.
He's wrong about everything.

36:49.333 --> 36:52.792
He makes marriage sound like
it's this huge deal, and it
isn't.

36:52.792 --> 36:58.375
It's just... It's just us,
you know? Like it's been
the last two years.

36:58.375 --> 37:01.250
Nothing has to change.

37:01.250 --> 37:03.709
I thought the same thing,

37:03.709 --> 37:07.125
that nothing has to change,
that I could handle it on
my own,

37:07.125 --> 37:08.750
but I couldn't.

37:10.083 --> 37:11.750
I needed you.

37:12.959 --> 37:16.542
I mean,
today was a complete disaster.

37:16.542 --> 37:22.291
- Well, why didn't you call me?
- Because I didn't think that
I could.

37:22.291 --> 37:26.542
Well, you can.
Will you call me next time?

37:26.542 --> 37:28.208
And you'll be there?

37:29.375 --> 37:32.875
Baby, I'll be there.

37:33.875 --> 37:35.625
OK, good,
'cause I'm gonna call you.

37:35.625 --> 37:37.250
Then call me.

37:40.041 --> 37:43.291
- We're gonna set a date?
- Yeah.

37:43.291 --> 37:47.750
- And look at venues?
- Yes. Whatever you want.

37:47.750 --> 37:51.125
- Together?
- Together.

38:04.625 --> 38:08.709
Dave is always talking about
signs, and I never believe
in that stuff,

38:08.709 --> 38:13.500
but seeing you,

38:13.500 --> 38:18.291
there is no one on this Earth
I would have rather run into
tonight.

38:18.291 --> 38:22.166
Well, Dave's right,
there are signs,

38:22.166 --> 38:24.792
you know,
but only if you're open to it.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.834
Maybe you won't
get this deal,

38:26.834 --> 38:30.333
or maybe it'll lead to another
one, or something better,

38:30.333 --> 38:33.792
if you just stay open
to the possibilities.

38:33.792 --> 38:35.667
At least,
that's what Dr. Phil says.

38:35.667 --> 38:37.625
[both chuckle]

38:40.083 --> 38:41.750
You gonna let me call you?

38:45.417 --> 38:46.625
No.

38:48.542 --> 38:50.417
I'm gonna call you.

39:11.625 --> 39:13.750
[Angelo] Nicole.

39:13.750 --> 39:15.750
I'll be right there.

39:40.458 --> 39:42.875
I, uh...
forgot my laptop.

39:45.709 --> 39:47.709
Me too.

39:49.542 --> 39:52.041
[Dave sighs]

39:52.041 --> 39:53.792
- Listen...
- We were both...

39:53.792 --> 39:56.125
- Just big dumb girls.
- Yeah.

40:00.291 --> 40:04.417
So what next? Makeup sex?

40:05.875 --> 40:07.583
You do look good
in that shirt.

40:10.250 --> 40:11.792
[phones ringing]

40:19.333 --> 40:20.625
- Hello?
- Hello?

40:20.625 --> 40:22.417
I have a call.
Can you hold, please?

40:22.417 --> 40:24.417
- Yes, I can hold.
- Yes, I can hold.

40:25.583 --> 40:27.291
- No way.
- No way.

40:27.291 --> 40:30.583
- Hello?
- You talk. You talk.

40:30.583 --> 40:32.917
- Hello?
- Hello, yes.

40:32.917 --> 40:36.417
- We decided
to go with you guys.
- That's fantastic news.

40:36.417 --> 40:39.333
We look forward
to doing business with you. Yes.

40:39.333 --> 40:41.875
- Very good.
- Thank you. Bye, now.

40:41.875 --> 40:43.250
Bye, now.

40:43.250 --> 40:48.083
I prayed to God! I don't ask
for much! Way to go, God!

40:48.083 --> 40:51.083
- Control your fantasy.
You were right!
- No, the signs!

40:51.083 --> 40:53.834
The signs, Bri.
You gotta believe in the signs!

40:53.834 --> 40:55.917
[screaming]
I can't believe it!

40:55.917 --> 40:58.750
[♪♪]

41:04.333 --> 41:06.375
Deena.

41:06.375 --> 41:10.291
Richard.
I can't believe you're here.

41:10.291 --> 41:14.667
- What happened? I was at Aroma.
- I know. I'm sorry. I couldn't.

41:16.583 --> 41:19.291
- You probably hate me now.
- No, I don't hate you.

41:19.291 --> 41:21.875
But I was just
starting to think

41:21.875 --> 41:25.667
maybe the universe was trying
to tell us something, you know?

41:25.667 --> 41:30.458
- And then... here you are.
- Good old universe.

41:34.709 --> 41:37.625
You, uh... you need
a hand with your bags?

41:37.625 --> 41:40.458
I hired a baby-sitter,
and she's still there,

41:40.458 --> 41:42.500
because I was coming
to see you.

41:42.500 --> 41:45.000
- It's fine.
- It's just...
