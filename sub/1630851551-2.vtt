WEBVTT

00:48.920 --> 00:50.360
No, thank you.

00:56.680 --> 00:57.960
All right?

00:57.960 --> 00:59.960
My nerves are frayed.

00:59.960 --> 01:01.280
Are you Mr Redford?

01:01.280 --> 01:04.520
I'm deaf, I'm mute, my synapses
are firing out of control,

01:04.520 --> 01:06.640
I can't think
a single clear thought.

01:06.640 --> 01:09.320
I'm trying so hard to concentrate,
but every five minutes,

01:09.320 --> 01:11.360
someone crashes into my space.

01:11.360 --> 01:13.200
If I don't accomplish
something today,

01:13.200 --> 01:16.120
I shall not be responsible
for my actions.

01:16.120 --> 01:17.440
Are you Mr Redford?

01:17.440 --> 01:20.040
Mr Redford does not exist
without his work.

01:20.040 --> 01:21.800
Why can't anyone understand that?

01:24.640 --> 01:26.400
There, a signed first edition.

01:26.400 --> 01:27.720
You have what you came for.

01:27.720 --> 01:29.720
Now, I beg you, leave me alone.

01:29.720 --> 01:30.920
I beg you!

01:36.600 --> 01:38.200
There's a spelling mistake on this.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.280
What? Impossible! You lie.

01:40.280 --> 01:42.280
Yeah. I just wanted you
to keep the door open.

01:42.280 --> 01:44.760
You are a... Na-na-na!

01:44.760 --> 01:46.560
Has someone died here? Yes.

01:46.560 --> 01:48.400
Then you're going to want
to invite me in.

01:48.400 --> 01:49.760
Ah, so you're the cleaner.

01:49.760 --> 01:52.400
No. I am the crime scene cleaner.

01:52.400 --> 01:54.080
Big difference. Huge.

01:54.080 --> 01:56.480
My work starts where
others pass in horror.

01:56.480 --> 01:59.440
A tired cliche, that I'm sure
you've used a thousand times.

02:00.440 --> 02:02.120
I hate your beard.

02:02.120 --> 02:04.720
What? Yeah, that's not
a tired cliche, is it?

02:04.720 --> 02:06.440
Now, would you like
to invite me in?

02:06.440 --> 02:08.000
Now is not a good time.

02:09.240 --> 02:11.320
Right.

02:11.320 --> 02:15.920
OK, well, you'll have to sign this
to say you don't need my services.

02:15.920 --> 02:18.120
And if you've got blood and
human remains in there,

02:18.120 --> 02:19.880
you might want to
clean them up quickly,

02:19.880 --> 02:22.680
or you're going to have some
unwanted housemates. Bye.

02:23.760 --> 02:26.520
Wait! what unwanted housemates?

02:26.520 --> 02:27.760
Bacteria.

02:27.760 --> 02:29.200
Oh, bacteria.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.640
The rats. Rats? Yes, rats!

02:31.640 --> 02:34.000
A real vermin house party. Enjoy.

02:34.000 --> 02:35.800
All right, y-you may come in.

02:35.800 --> 02:38.240
No. No, you're all right.
You've signed this now.

02:38.240 --> 02:41.640
I...think I'll go and
have a lovely beer.

02:41.640 --> 02:44.520
Please! I-I don't want
a vermin house party.

02:44.520 --> 02:45.960
I have a deadline.

02:45.960 --> 02:47.880
Oh, dear.

02:47.880 --> 02:51.440
£20. I'll give you £20 for beer.

02:51.440 --> 02:53.400
I don't even like beer.

02:56.560 --> 02:58.840
I do like beer. Go on.

02:58.840 --> 02:59.920
Come on, then.

03:11.080 --> 03:12.640
I shall be working in here.

03:12.640 --> 03:15.520
Please do not enter at
any point, for any reason.

03:15.520 --> 03:18.680
There. As you can see,
the blood is extensive.

03:18.680 --> 03:21.720
I've covered it with brown paper
because it's a little visceral.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.920
It's a little...?
It is triggering.

03:23.920 --> 03:26.320
Everyone's getting triggered
these days, aren't they?

03:26.320 --> 03:28.200
Lot of triggering going on.

03:28.200 --> 03:30.600
No?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.600
Not a lot of him left. Her.

03:32.600 --> 03:34.800
Oh. What, er...?

03:34.800 --> 03:37.600
Some kind of explosion,
sending shrapnel everywhere.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.760
That wood-burner is connected
to the heating system.

03:40.760 --> 03:44.160
They think a malfunction
caused a gas backdraught,

03:44.160 --> 03:47.040
simultaneously slicing and
incinerating the victim.

03:47.040 --> 03:50.160
Essentially, she burnt to death
because she was too old to escape.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.360
Horrific.

03:52.360 --> 03:53.760
Can't even imagine.

03:53.760 --> 03:55.840
You're a cleaner,
you're not paid to imagine.

03:55.840 --> 03:57.400
Hey, we can imagine!

03:57.400 --> 03:58.640
Go on, then.

04:01.960 --> 04:03.360
A moon.

04:05.760 --> 04:08.000
OK, well,
now the heating isn't working,

04:08.000 --> 04:10.600
and I'm writing a novel set
during a Provencal summer.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.360
I'm freezing. I'm in hell.

04:12.360 --> 04:14.400
Right. Were you here
when it happened?

04:14.400 --> 04:16.440
Thankfully no,
I was at a reading.

04:16.440 --> 04:19.800
The idea that my friend's
shit poetry saved my life...

04:19.800 --> 04:22.560
Well, the irony is not lost.

04:22.560 --> 04:26.000
And now, if you'll excuse me,
I must return to Provence.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.760
I've got a question.

04:27.760 --> 04:29.040
Yes?

04:29.040 --> 04:31.040
Who was it? Who was what?

04:31.040 --> 04:32.360
Who was that?

04:32.360 --> 04:33.960
Oh. My grandmother.

04:33.960 --> 04:35.520
Oh!

04:35.520 --> 04:37.560
OK, well, I'll...

04:37.560 --> 04:39.120
Good.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.360
And, you know...

04:42.040 --> 04:44.200
I'm sorry. What for?

04:46.440 --> 04:47.520
For your loss.

04:47.520 --> 04:49.960
Why are you sorry?
Did you kill her?

04:49.960 --> 04:52.000
I was just being polite, mate.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.920
It's another worn-out cliche.

04:53.920 --> 04:56.200
You're not sorry.
You didn't know my grandmother.

04:56.200 --> 04:58.200
Why would you be sorry
that she's dead?

04:58.200 --> 05:01.120
It's a bastardisation
of the language.

05:01.120 --> 05:04.080
You're right.
I couldn't care less she's dead.

05:04.080 --> 05:06.040
There! Now, doesn't
that feel fresher?

05:06.040 --> 05:07.680
The clean air of honesty!

05:07.680 --> 05:09.240
I'm glad she's dead!

05:09.240 --> 05:11.320
Why would you be glad?
I got carried away, it's...

05:11.320 --> 05:12.720
You are indifferent.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.360
You didn't know my grandmother.

05:14.360 --> 05:17.120
You are indifferent to
her life and death.

05:17.120 --> 05:18.480
That is proper.

05:19.680 --> 05:21.200
Sorry.

05:21.200 --> 05:25.240
About saying I'm glad,
not about her death.

05:25.240 --> 05:27.160
About which you are...?

05:28.440 --> 05:29.960
Indifferent?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.520
Dick. I can hear you.

05:38.520 --> 05:40.080
Sorry.

05:40.080 --> 05:41.760
But not about your dead nan.

06:30.400 --> 06:32.160
I must have quiet.

06:34.360 --> 06:35.920
I've got to move the paper.

06:35.920 --> 06:38.040
Well, move it silently.

06:38.040 --> 06:40.280
It's paper. It scrunches.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.640
It's sort of known
for its scrunchiness.

06:51.760 --> 06:54.480
It's going to take ages
to clear the area like that.

06:54.480 --> 06:56.760
I'll scrunch it all at once.
I'll speed scrunch.

06:56.760 --> 06:59.080
I can't work next to scrunching,

06:59.080 --> 07:00.920
regardless of the scrunch rate.

07:00.920 --> 07:02.440
Well, I don't like tippy-tappy.

07:02.440 --> 07:04.440
Tippy-tappy doesn't
affect your work!

07:04.440 --> 07:06.360
Scrunching affects mine.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.720
The fact that I'm using words
like "tippy-tappy"

07:08.720 --> 07:10.320
and "scrunch rate" proves it.

07:10.320 --> 07:12.840
You've reduced my vocabulary
to yours!

07:12.840 --> 07:15.080
Please, I beg you,
I must have quiet.

07:16.240 --> 07:18.720
Fine.

07:18.720 --> 07:20.760
But I know words you don't know.

07:20.760 --> 07:23.720
I very much doubt it,
with the greatest of respect.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.240
Crackletranton. What?

07:25.240 --> 07:27.000
Yeah, you don't know
that word, do you?

07:27.000 --> 07:28.400
You've clearly made it up.

07:28.400 --> 07:31.200
Perhaps I did make it up -
but you didn't know it, did you?

07:37.240 --> 07:39.400
Yeah, yeah, I'm here.

07:39.400 --> 07:41.400
What's it like?
It's a crackletranton.

07:43.240 --> 07:46.200
OK, you want to dance?
Let's dance!

07:46.200 --> 07:48.360
My synapses are on fire.

07:48.360 --> 07:50.600
I am on the verge of writer's block.

07:50.600 --> 07:53.560
I don't suppose there's an
equivalent in the world of cleaning,

07:53.560 --> 07:57.280
so let me try and put it to you
in such a way as you understand.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.480
If I don't finish
this chapter today,

07:59.480 --> 08:01.040
I will kill myself.

08:01.040 --> 08:02.800
Does that make you understand?

08:02.800 --> 08:05.240
I will snuff out my life force,

08:05.240 --> 08:06.520
then you'll have a death

08:06.520 --> 08:09.200
that you can legitimately
tell people you're sorry about,

08:09.200 --> 08:11.000
because you caused it!

08:11.000 --> 08:13.600
All you have to do is clean,

08:13.600 --> 08:17.200
and all I ask of you,
within that most basic of tasks,

08:17.200 --> 08:19.320
is that you clean quietly!

08:19.320 --> 08:21.200
Do you understand?!

08:22.360 --> 08:23.680
Yes.

08:23.680 --> 08:24.960
Yes, I fully understand.

08:38.920 --> 08:42.320
This? Aw... I've got cleaner's block.

08:42.320 --> 08:43.680
You son of a bitch!

08:43.680 --> 08:45.680
Yeah. It's a very serious condition.

08:45.680 --> 08:47.000
I could be here for months,

08:47.000 --> 08:49.080
if I don't decide
to use the vacuum cleaner

08:49.080 --> 08:50.840
to hoover away my life force.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.800
It's money, is it? That's what
talks to you people, isn't it?

08:53.800 --> 08:55.240
Hard cash.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.840
20 not enough to guzzle away?

08:57.840 --> 09:00.240
£50...if I don't hear a peep.

09:01.320 --> 09:03.560
150, and I'll be like
a mouse that hovers.

09:03.560 --> 09:04.880
Yeah, a hover mouse.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.200
You can't use that,
I'm writing a children's book.

09:07.200 --> 09:09.600
£100, cash.

09:11.720 --> 09:14.960
The only noise you will hear
from now on is the tippy-tappy

09:14.960 --> 09:16.760
of your porky little fingers.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.160
Le Responsable
by Jacques Dutronc

10:51.560 --> 10:53.520
Oh, f...!

11:06.640 --> 11:08.880
Oh, hello, little fella.

11:10.720 --> 11:12.160
You look lost.

11:15.640 --> 11:16.680
Ruff!

11:19.000 --> 11:20.280
Argh!

11:29.440 --> 11:31.320
I've been trying, mate!

11:31.320 --> 11:32.720
You're bleeding.

11:32.720 --> 11:34.880
Yes, it's a shaving cut.

11:34.880 --> 11:36.360
You shave your forehead?

11:36.360 --> 11:39.880
Yes, I'm sorry,
I've got a hairy forehead.

11:39.880 --> 11:41.800
I'm sorry about my frostiness.

11:41.800 --> 11:43.360
It's not you.

11:43.360 --> 11:45.280
I'm burned out, on empty.

11:45.280 --> 11:48.240
I've been trying to describe
someone climbing some stairs

11:48.240 --> 11:49.680
for nearly four days.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.480
Four days? How big's the house?

11:51.480 --> 11:54.640
No, I've spent four days
trying to find the right word.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.440
"Floating" is too ethereal,

11:56.440 --> 11:58.120
"hurrying" is too urgent.

11:58.120 --> 12:00.640
"He mastered the stairs"
is too masculine,

12:00.640 --> 12:02.360
"trudging" too subservient.

12:02.360 --> 12:05.600
"His feet swallowed the stairs"
is sexualised.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.400
I liked "he staired up"
for a while,

12:08.400 --> 12:11.120
then I realised
it's a nonsensical pun.

12:11.120 --> 12:15.200
The other characters are waiting
for him at the top of the stairs,

12:15.200 --> 12:18.120
but I can't continue the story
until I have the right word.

12:18.120 --> 12:21.200
It's a wolf in my mind,
do you understand?

12:21.200 --> 12:24.000
A wolf that consumes my mind.

12:26.440 --> 12:27.640
Stumble?

12:42.440 --> 12:43.920
Graham Greene!

12:45.560 --> 12:47.120
Stumble, yeah?

12:47.120 --> 12:49.480
Ah, another part
of the jigsaw of madness.

12:50.640 --> 12:53.280
I should get you
a beer to celebrate.

12:53.280 --> 12:55.520
No, no, I can't drink
during the week.

12:55.520 --> 12:57.080
I've got a condition.

12:57.080 --> 12:58.800
It means once I start, I can't stop.

12:58.800 --> 13:00.040
Medical condition?

13:00.040 --> 13:01.960
Yeah, it's called, er...

13:01.960 --> 13:03.440
..being an absolute legend.

13:05.440 --> 13:07.680
Oh.

13:07.680 --> 13:10.680
So, you are a crime scene cleaner?

13:10.680 --> 13:13.560
I am. And what does that involve?

13:13.560 --> 13:16.240
It's mainly delivering
patio furniture.

13:16.240 --> 13:17.720
A joke.

13:17.720 --> 13:20.320
Yeah. Very good. Enjoyable.

13:20.320 --> 13:24.320
And what is this
little cleaning agent?

13:24.320 --> 13:27.800
It's sodium hydroxide.
It's for dissolving flesh.

13:30.640 --> 13:32.320
Eh!

13:32.320 --> 13:34.400
Two jokes, two sentences.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.960
Maybe I should become a writer.

13:35.960 --> 13:38.480
Don't. It's mental torture.

13:38.480 --> 13:39.760
Can I tell you something?

13:41.560 --> 13:44.960
I actually won a little
writing award at school once.

13:44.960 --> 13:46.320
Go on.

13:46.320 --> 13:49.240
We had to come up with an
advertising slogan for a product,

13:49.240 --> 13:51.040
and I got given cigarettes.

13:51.040 --> 13:54.160
Shows you how long ago
it was, and...

13:54.160 --> 13:57.280
Oh...it doesn't matter.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.560
It was stupid.

13:58.560 --> 14:00.440
Please, I'm interested.

14:00.440 --> 14:01.800
It was just...

14:04.080 --> 14:06.240
"Fancy a fag?

14:06.240 --> 14:07.640
"Have a drag."

14:10.480 --> 14:11.960
Just simple.

14:21.040 --> 14:22.960
You can use it, if you want.

14:22.960 --> 14:24.800
No, I won't be using it.

14:24.800 --> 14:27.440
No? I was thinking
he could use it when he gets

14:27.440 --> 14:29.080
to the top of the stairs.

14:29.080 --> 14:32.160
Everyone could say, "Oh, you
look stressed. Fancy a fag?"

14:32.160 --> 14:34.640
"I'll have a drag."

14:34.640 --> 14:36.760
It's shit.

14:36.760 --> 14:39.600
It's the mindless utterance
of a cleaner-to-be.

14:39.600 --> 14:41.440
I'm a crime scene cleaner.

14:41.440 --> 14:44.240
Yes, yes.
"Pass in horror," etc, etc.

14:46.560 --> 14:49.560
Look, can I ask you something?
A serious question.

14:49.560 --> 14:51.400
Quickly, please.

14:51.400 --> 14:53.400
Why aren't you upset
about your gran?

14:53.400 --> 14:55.160
What makes you think I'm not upset?

14:55.160 --> 14:58.400
Well, normally,
people are affected by a loss.

14:58.400 --> 14:59.960
They show it in some way.

14:59.960 --> 15:01.440
What about your nan?

15:01.440 --> 15:04.320
She was an extraordinary woman,
and her loss, a fire in my soul.

15:04.320 --> 15:06.600
Tell your face.
Tell my face what?

15:06.600 --> 15:09.080
Normally, people...cry?

15:09.080 --> 15:11.480
I can't afford to cry.

15:11.480 --> 15:15.000
Look, I could break down now,
in front of you, rivers of tears,

15:15.000 --> 15:17.360
and fall into your arms -
and then, what?

15:17.360 --> 15:19.840
Well, then you'd feel better.
I'm a great cuddle.

15:19.840 --> 15:22.280
Look, I've got lovely,
big mum tits. Come on.

15:22.280 --> 15:24.240
Oh, God! Come on.

15:24.240 --> 15:28.040
But then, all the emotion
would be used up, wasted.

15:28.040 --> 15:29.600
My grandmother would be buried,

15:29.600 --> 15:32.440
and I'd sit down to try
and describe the pain,

15:32.440 --> 15:34.320
and there'd be nothing left.

15:34.320 --> 15:38.800
You can't use everything that you
go through in life for a book!

15:38.800 --> 15:41.520
Sometimes,
you've just got to...be.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.640
I think my grandmother
deserves more than

15:43.640 --> 15:45.680
a spontaneous howl of anguish.

15:45.680 --> 15:48.520
She deserves a novella, at least.

15:48.520 --> 15:50.600
So, I shall push it down.

15:50.600 --> 15:53.400
I either cry, or I write.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.000
Hm.

15:55.000 --> 15:57.280
Well, doesn't sound
very healthy to me.

15:57.280 --> 16:02.240
It isn't, but I've been published
in 28 countries, whereas you,

16:02.240 --> 16:04.800
when you "fancy a fag, have a drag".

16:04.800 --> 16:07.720
Well, if I have to push everything
down to become a writer,

16:07.720 --> 16:09.360
I'll stick to cleaning up blood.

16:09.360 --> 16:12.520
One must be consumed
by what one does.

16:12.520 --> 16:16.000
Dylan Thomas makes an interesting
point about it, actually.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.480
Oh, right, well, there's no
need to find it. I believe you.

16:18.480 --> 16:20.400
No, it's an interesting
passage. I'll...

16:20.400 --> 16:21.920
Yeah, I don't want to see it.

16:21.920 --> 16:24.640
It's relevant to our discussion.
But I'm not interested.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.120
Leave it!

16:27.560 --> 16:30.120
I hate this book. I despise it.

16:30.120 --> 16:31.240
Have you read it?

16:31.240 --> 16:33.120
Yes, of course I've read it.

16:33.120 --> 16:35.080
He's the worst writer
to come out of...

16:37.880 --> 16:39.800
Wales? Yes, Wales!

16:39.800 --> 16:42.280
"Oh, I've got a doll
with a big, tall hat

16:42.280 --> 16:44.040
"and a house full of spoons."

16:44.040 --> 16:45.840
Wales! Get over yourselves!

16:45.840 --> 16:48.520
He's one of the 20th century's
greatest writers.

16:48.520 --> 16:50.120
I hate his writing.

16:50.120 --> 16:52.480
His writing makes my balls
go up inside myself.

16:52.480 --> 16:54.680
You don't like his style?

16:54.680 --> 16:56.480
What don't you like about it?

16:56.480 --> 16:58.920
Well, it's so...

17:01.200 --> 17:03.120
...pecky, isn't it?

17:03.120 --> 17:06.160
Pecky? Yes, pecky. Isn't it?

17:06.160 --> 17:09.840
"Oh, I'm Dylan Thomas. Oh, look
at my words. Peck, peck, peck."

17:09.840 --> 17:11.920
So, pecky in terms of the sharp...

17:11.920 --> 17:15.320
Sharp... ..disjointed nature of
the prose. ..nature of the prose.

17:15.320 --> 17:19.000
So, you feel that by jumping
from image to juxtaposed image,

17:19.000 --> 17:20.880
we never really emotionally engage.

17:20.880 --> 17:24.000
Exactly. The guy's a prick. Oh.

17:27.200 --> 17:28.720
Aah!

17:28.720 --> 17:30.720
You holding your emotions in again?

17:30.720 --> 17:35.160
The pain I just felt will
flow across the next page.

17:35.160 --> 17:37.480
Well, as long as
it doesn't peck across it, eh?

17:37.480 --> 17:40.080
No, not like that prick
Dylan Thomas.

17:40.080 --> 17:43.680
We make a pretty good team,
eh, you and me?

17:43.680 --> 17:44.960
Meh.

17:56.200 --> 17:57.240
Pip-yup!

17:59.080 --> 18:00.880
Terence Redford? Yes.

18:00.880 --> 18:03.240
We come with news. I'm very busy.

18:03.240 --> 18:06.640
We know you must be consumed
with your next masterpiece,

18:06.640 --> 18:09.320
but we bring news
of an important award.

18:09.320 --> 18:11.200
An award? For one of my...?

18:11.200 --> 18:13.640
Slow The Seconds To Midnight
has been nominated

18:13.640 --> 18:15.400
in the Best Novel category.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.400
My sources have led me
to believe that you are in

18:18.400 --> 18:20.480
a very favourable position.

18:20.480 --> 18:22.040
Goodness!

18:22.040 --> 18:24.520
And what is the award, may I ask?

18:24.520 --> 18:26.600
A very important one. Which one?

18:28.200 --> 18:30.800
I am not at liberty to say.

18:30.800 --> 18:32.400
I see.

18:32.400 --> 18:33.720
Would you wait there?

18:38.760 --> 18:41.080
Come here,
you manky little stray.

18:44.160 --> 18:45.400
Oi!

18:46.480 --> 18:47.560
No!

18:52.640 --> 18:53.680
Dickhead!

18:56.480 --> 18:58.040
Ah!

18:58.040 --> 19:00.480
Oh! Is that a first edition?

19:00.480 --> 19:02.920
It is indeed.

19:02.920 --> 19:05.280
Would it be impertinent
to ask for a signature?

19:05.280 --> 19:06.560
Not at all.

19:15.280 --> 19:17.280
Ooh! Are you entertaining?

19:17.280 --> 19:19.760
Yes, yes. And what are
your names, please?

19:19.760 --> 19:22.440
I am Mrs Gathernoid,
and this is Miss Chant.

19:22.440 --> 19:23.920
Barbara Chant!

19:28.440 --> 19:30.640
"To the small woman
and the big woman.

19:30.640 --> 19:33.200
"Your lies are a disease
that will eat you."

19:33.200 --> 19:35.400
You are not from
an award committee,

19:35.400 --> 19:36.960
you are desperate groupies,

19:36.960 --> 19:40.920
and if you waste another second
of my time, I will destroy you!

19:40.920 --> 19:43.200
Now, get back on the train to...

19:43.200 --> 19:45.760
Gloucester. Of course, Gloucester!

19:45.760 --> 19:49.640
A rock which, when lifted,
is teeming with roaches.

19:58.720 --> 20:00.320
That was your fault.

20:08.120 --> 20:09.520
How dare they!

20:09.520 --> 20:12.040
How dare they use my
longing for recognition

20:12.040 --> 20:13.720
to their own foul ends!

20:13.720 --> 20:15.560
They know I crave the Booker,

20:15.560 --> 20:18.080
they know the Sunday Times
are blind to me.

20:18.080 --> 20:19.760
Every week, they come,

20:19.760 --> 20:22.520
the zombie army
of lonely housewives.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.360
Well, damn you, wretched sows.

20:25.360 --> 20:28.800
You've just made the female
protagonist get lost at sea,

20:28.800 --> 20:30.680
never to return.

20:30.680 --> 20:32.360
Hairy nose, as well?

21:11.160 --> 21:13.720
Well, you didn't push
your feelings down very well

21:13.720 --> 21:14.960
with them, did you?

21:14.960 --> 21:18.240
Because they took advantage
of a writer's greatest fear.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.920
It's about leaving a mark,

21:19.920 --> 21:22.240
leaving evidence that you existed.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.880
Well, the books do that, don't they?

21:23.880 --> 21:27.240
An award will bring
more people to my books.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.360
I'll cast a longer shadow.

21:29.360 --> 21:31.040
Don't you understand?

21:31.040 --> 21:33.280
No, not really.

21:33.280 --> 21:35.400
Mind you, I suppose
if I do my job properly,

21:35.400 --> 21:37.680
then I don't leave a trace
behind me.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.320
It's like I never existed.

21:39.320 --> 21:40.760
And that doesn't bother you?

21:40.760 --> 21:43.600
No. What do I care what people
think when I'm gone?

21:43.600 --> 21:44.960
I'll be dead.

21:44.960 --> 21:47.880
But you could live on
in people's minds.

21:47.880 --> 21:50.600
Well, that's like someone
buying a pint for me

21:50.600 --> 21:52.320
just before I have a heart attack.

21:52.320 --> 21:54.400
I don't get to enjoy the pint.

21:54.400 --> 21:55.720
And if there is a Heaven,

21:55.720 --> 21:58.040
I'll be looking down,
watching someone drink my pint,

21:58.040 --> 22:00.080
and I won't like that,
I'll be jealous,

22:00.080 --> 22:01.840
because I love a pint.

22:01.840 --> 22:04.920
If you had one hour left to live,
what would you do?

22:04.920 --> 22:07.920
Look, we do this stuff down
at the pub all the time,

22:07.920 --> 22:10.120
and I'm not particularly
proud of my answer,

22:10.120 --> 22:11.560
but I tell the truth -

22:11.560 --> 22:14.240
I would enjoy going round
the ladies' changing room,

22:14.240 --> 22:17.360
and I would enjoy watching them
try their bras on.

22:17.360 --> 22:19.680
What?

22:19.680 --> 22:22.040
No, that's not "hour to live",

22:22.040 --> 22:24.400
that's "invisible for the day",
isn't it?

22:24.400 --> 22:27.560
No, come on,
you've got one hour left.

22:27.560 --> 22:29.280
I don't know.

22:31.160 --> 22:32.960
I suppose I'd write to my ex.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.440
What does it matter
what your ex thinks?

22:35.440 --> 22:36.880
You'll be dead.

22:36.880 --> 22:39.000
Not while I'm writing
that letter, I won't be,

22:39.000 --> 22:41.720
and there's a few things
I'll enjoy getting off my chest.

22:41.720 --> 22:44.840
"Oh, didn't like the way
I used to load the dishwasher?

22:44.840 --> 22:47.360
"Well, your sister's racist."

22:47.360 --> 22:48.680
Jesus!

23:26.920 --> 23:29.120
You writing about me?

23:29.120 --> 23:30.480
What do you care?

23:30.480 --> 23:32.440
Well, I don't know
what you're saying!

23:32.440 --> 23:34.440
You're happy to disappear
once you've died,

23:34.440 --> 23:35.680
so don't worry about it.

23:38.560 --> 23:40.720
"I observed the gargantuan
pot-bellied man

23:40.720 --> 23:42.200
"going about his business."

23:44.280 --> 23:45.520
And that's me, is it?

23:46.600 --> 23:49.680
Well... Well, it's not going to be
a best-seller, is it, mate?

23:49.680 --> 23:52.480
The most mundane of activities
can be made interesting

23:52.480 --> 23:54.120
in the right context.

23:54.120 --> 23:56.040
Mundane? Yes.

23:56.040 --> 23:58.520
Tedious, inconsequential, dull.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.920
Let me tell you
some interesting stories.

24:00.920 --> 24:03.280
No, you just carry on.
Act like I'm not here.

24:03.280 --> 24:05.200
I will capture the truth.

24:06.480 --> 24:08.360
How many books did you
sell last time?

24:08.360 --> 24:09.840
Just shy of 100,000.

24:11.440 --> 24:13.200
I'll get some interesting things.

24:19.160 --> 24:21.280
There's some good stuff here,
straight away.

24:21.280 --> 24:24.440
Straight away. Ooh...
Now, this is daptrozone.

24:24.440 --> 24:27.480
That's for separating
blood and plasma.

24:27.480 --> 24:29.880
You could...

24:29.880 --> 24:33.200
And this, the bad bin.

24:33.200 --> 24:35.000
It's for severed body parts.

24:35.000 --> 24:37.480
Come on, mate, it's a finger bin!

24:37.480 --> 24:38.920
Not my genre.

24:38.920 --> 24:40.440
I've got good stories.

24:40.440 --> 24:43.560
Last year, I got called out to
a job, I had to take away a man -

24:43.560 --> 24:45.680
a chimp had had his legs away.

24:45.680 --> 24:48.120
I thought you weren't bothered
about being remembered.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.960
Well, I'm not, but I'm not having
those arseholes down the pub

24:50.960 --> 24:54.240
read a book with a boring
character and know it's me.

24:54.240 --> 24:55.480
What's that?

24:57.560 --> 24:59.160
That's my lunch.

24:59.160 --> 25:01.000
May I? Yeah.

25:09.160 --> 25:10.720
What is it?

25:10.720 --> 25:12.240
It's a sausage sarnie.

25:12.240 --> 25:14.200
Well, half of one.

25:17.400 --> 25:18.920
And then, this?

25:20.840 --> 25:22.240
Brown sauce.

25:23.600 --> 25:26.080
No salad?

25:26.080 --> 25:27.960
Who puts salad on a
sausage sandwich?

25:31.000 --> 25:33.080
What, you're writing
about my sandwich?

25:33.080 --> 25:34.360
Mm-hm.

25:34.360 --> 25:36.760
So, I've spent all day
listening to your madness,

25:36.760 --> 25:38.480
and cleaning up your grandmother,

25:38.480 --> 25:40.600
and you're writing about
my sandwich?

25:40.600 --> 25:42.160
It's the perfect metaphor.

25:42.160 --> 25:44.880
It is both dead and alive
simultaneously.

25:44.880 --> 25:47.160
But have you put
it's Wicky's sandwich?

25:47.160 --> 25:49.920
No, it is a sausage sandwich
lost in time.

25:49.920 --> 25:51.360
It's MY sandwich!

25:51.360 --> 25:53.480
You don't care if
anyone remembers you.

25:53.480 --> 25:55.040
You don't seek meaning.

25:55.040 --> 25:56.960
It is the universe's sandwich.

25:56.960 --> 25:58.360
Oh, yeah?

26:02.120 --> 26:03.680
It's my sandwich.

26:03.680 --> 26:05.120
Please!

26:19.680 --> 26:22.920
The fog will have gone in about
two hours, and so will I.

26:22.920 --> 26:24.400
Well, thank you.

26:24.400 --> 26:26.760
You're not welcome.

26:26.760 --> 26:30.240
I don't want you to accuse me
of using cliches, do I?

26:32.640 --> 26:34.320
Well, goodbye.

26:34.320 --> 26:36.360
My publisher awaits. Terence?

26:38.960 --> 26:41.720
I haven't read anything
by Dylan Thomas.

26:41.720 --> 26:43.040
I wouldn't bother.

26:43.040 --> 26:44.440
He's very pecky.

26:46.680 --> 26:48.640
I know you must think me strange,

26:48.640 --> 26:50.200
but I want you to know,

26:50.200 --> 26:53.200
one cannot always
control one's grief.

26:53.200 --> 26:55.320
Recently, I cried for a week.

26:55.320 --> 26:56.840
Why?

26:56.840 --> 26:59.280
It sounds silly, but...

26:59.280 --> 27:00.800
..my cat ran away.

27:02.720 --> 27:07.320
I grieve for my cat,
but for my grandmother...

27:07.320 --> 27:08.840
You'll find a way.

27:24.360 --> 27:25.760
"My grandmother was

27:25.760 --> 27:29.000
"the most beautiful woman
in the world.

27:29.000 --> 27:31.680
"She stood in the small,
wood-panelled kitchen

27:31.680 --> 27:35.560
"of her farmhouse, cooking
sausages for my sandwich.

27:37.720 --> 27:41.320
"'What is a sausage, Gran?'
I asked.

27:41.320 --> 27:44.760
"She smiled and ruffled my hair.

27:44.760 --> 27:48.640
"'Just eat, my love. Just eat.'"
