37:32.702 --> 37:35.645
maybe Pendleton can wait a little bit.

37:36.567 --> 37:39.187
You think I'm gonna miss the
chance to help you get your sister?

37:39.243 --> 37:41.700
See what all this fuss is about?

37:44.995 --> 37:48.595
I'm really sorry that you won't
be able to get Jessica back.

37:55.976 --> 38:00.049
Maybe we do need to stop
trying to fix the past...

38:01.005 --> 38:03.690
and start looking at the present.

38:06.152 --> 38:09.219
Maybe I do need to be
open to the possibilities.

38:10.836 --> 38:12.836
The possibilities of what?

38:15.184 --> 38:17.184
I don't know.

38:19.188 --> 38:22.282
I just know I'm not really
ready to say good-bye yet.

38:25.891 --> 38:28.529
Ah, the Lifeboat will be
charged and ready to go

38:28.531 --> 38:31.063
in three hours, my friends.

38:35.211 --> 38:36.992
[laughs]

38:37.309 --> 38:39.209
Will you tell Rufus
I'll be back in an hour?

38:39.211 --> 38:42.391
There's just one thing
I have to do first.

38:56.466 --> 38:58.195
Hey, Mom.

38:58.197 --> 38:59.696
Oh, Lucy!

39:00.028 --> 39:01.865
Oh, thank God.

39:01.890 --> 39:04.325
- It's been days. Where have you been?
- I know.

39:04.630 --> 39:07.677
- I have to tell you something.
- You can tell me anything.

39:09.959 --> 39:11.499
Come here.

39:11.524 --> 39:13.543
Here, just... here.

39:13.936 --> 39:16.100
- Here you go.
- All right.

39:16.210 --> 39:18.100
You're gonna think I'm insane,

39:18.116 --> 39:19.421
but you deserve the truth.

39:19.423 --> 39:21.890
- I'm listening.
- [chuckles]

39:22.064 --> 39:25.032
Connor Mason invented a time machine...

39:25.196 --> 39:26.695
and it's real.

39:26.697 --> 39:28.497
Time travel is real,

39:28.499 --> 39:30.688
and when I went on my first mission,

39:30.713 --> 39:32.446
I went to the Hindenburg in 1937,

39:32.447 --> 39:34.714
and when I left, I had a sister,

39:34.716 --> 39:37.157
and when I came back...

39:38.453 --> 39:39.953
she was gone.

39:39.955 --> 39:41.588
Lucy, a sister?

39:41.590 --> 39:44.624
Yes. I have a sister.
You have another daughter,

39:44.626 --> 39:46.559
and her name is Amy, and she is smart,

39:46.561 --> 39:49.237
and she is funny, and she
has a degree in sociology,

39:49.262 --> 39:51.096
and a black belt in karate,
which is super weird,

39:51.098 --> 39:52.964
and she has no idea what she
wants to do with her life,

39:52.966 --> 39:54.432
but oh, my God, does
she know how to live it,

39:54.434 --> 39:56.735
and she is my best friend.

39:56.737 --> 39:59.370
Lucy, this person doesn't exist.

39:59.372 --> 40:01.940
Yes, this person does exist.

40:01.942 --> 40:04.275
If you could remember the way
that we were as a family...

40:04.277 --> 40:06.912
if you woke up one day
and I was suddenly gone,

40:06.937 --> 40:08.269
you would have to do the same thing.

40:08.272 --> 40:10.928
- Do what?
- I have to get her back.

40:10.953 --> 40:12.405
I have to get her back.

40:12.430 --> 40:14.153
And the problem is that...

40:14.178 --> 40:15.644
in the timeline that Amy existed,

40:15.646 --> 40:17.257
you were sick... you were very...

40:17.282 --> 40:18.581
you were very sick.

40:18.583 --> 40:21.280
And I am gonna do everything
that I can to save you,

40:21.305 --> 40:23.752
but time travel is super unpredictable,

40:23.754 --> 40:24.987
and I don't know if
I'm gonna be able to,

40:24.989 --> 40:27.616
so I just want to tell you that I...

40:29.127 --> 40:30.793
I love you.

40:33.613 --> 40:35.613
Oh, sweetheart.

40:37.422 --> 40:40.524
Lucy, you won't lose me.

40:40.549 --> 40:42.339
- I promise.

Rittenhouse would never allow it.
