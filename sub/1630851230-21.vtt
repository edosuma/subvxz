Jenny's death
was ruled an accident.

19:08.190 --> 19:09.409
She was drinking
and smoking weed

19:09.452 --> 19:10.932
and decided to take a boat out.

19:10.975 --> 19:13.935
The cops figured that
she fell overboard and drowned.

19:13.978 --> 19:15.328
- And how does this
connect to Cassandra?

19:15.371 --> 19:17.939
- Because when you Google
Jenny Betz, you get this.

19:17.982 --> 19:20.942
It's a crowdsourced website
called "Finding Jenny"

19:20.985 --> 19:22.683
run by two guys trying to solve

19:22.726 --> 19:24.728
a cold case murder
in Providence, Rhode Island.

19:24.772 --> 19:27.383
- "Jenny Betz is wanted for
questioning in the 13-year-old

19:27.427 --> 19:30.952
"murder and dismemberment
of her landlady, Lisa Fanelli.

19:30.995 --> 19:32.432
"The Providence police
have determined that

19:32.475 --> 19:35.174
"Jenny Betz was not
her real name.

19:35.217 --> 19:38.046
So who is she really?"
- And the answer is...

19:39.308 --> 19:42.006
- Cassandra or whatever
her real name is.

19:42.050 --> 19:44.095
13-year-old photo,
but that's definitely her.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.446
- Yeah, next to her landlady,
Lisa Fanelli.

19:46.489 --> 19:49.449
I'm thinking that
she stole Jenny's identity,

19:49.492 --> 19:52.103
moved to Providence,
killed her landlady,

19:52.147 --> 19:54.671
moved to Long Island,
and became Cassandra Mason.

19:54.715 --> 19:55.803
- Hello?
- What I want to know

19:55.846 --> 19:56.934
is why a 17 year old needs

19:56.978 --> 19:58.197
a new identity
in the first place.

19:58.240 --> 20:00.286
What's a kid that age
need to hide from?

20:00.329 --> 20:02.375
- The stories about Treetops
could be true, right?

20:02.418 --> 20:05.334
Maybe she was afraid and ran.
- Hmm.

20:05.378 --> 20:07.293
- Guys, half an hour ago
in New Haven,

20:07.336 --> 20:08.729
a white female calls a valet

20:08.772 --> 20:10.034
and steals a car out
of the restaurant parking lot.

20:10.078 --> 20:13.081
- Is that our girl?
- Yeah, look.

20:13.124 --> 20:14.082
Could be one
of the wigs she stole

20:14.125 --> 20:15.388
from that department store.

20:15.431 --> 20:17.259
- Whoever she is,
whatever she's running from,

20:17.303 --> 20:19.435
she's clearly got
a big bag of tricks.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.958
- Hang on.

20:21.002 --> 20:22.786
The guys who run Finding Jenny,
they're in Providence?

20:22.830 --> 20:24.223
- Yeah.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.224
- Forget where
she's running from.

20:25.267 --> 20:26.312
It's where she's running to.

20:26.355 --> 20:28.314
New Haven is
on the way to Providence.

20:28.357 --> 20:30.403
If these website guys
are on a mission to reveal

20:30.446 --> 20:32.796
her true identity, she's not
gonna let that happen.

20:32.840 --> 20:34.189
- You think she knows
about the website.

20:34.233 --> 20:35.364
- I'd say yes.

20:35.408 --> 20:37.105
I'm gonna call Isobel
for a helicopter.

20:37.148 --> 20:38.367
We're going to Rhode Island.

20:45.722 --> 20:46.854
- No way! I can't believe
you guys are here.

20:46.897 --> 20:47.898
- This is our war room.
- Come on up.

20:47.942 --> 20:49.596
- Clues that come in go here,

20:49.639 --> 20:52.729
marked either dead or alive
depending on where we are.

20:52.773 --> 20:54.862
- Yeah, and here are
the people that are helping us.

20:54.905 --> 20:56.342
The good ones are up top.

20:56.385 --> 20:59.214
And the jag offs and the
wing nuts are at the bottom.

21:00.389 --> 21:02.783
- Do you guys have jobs?
- This is our job.

21:02.826 --> 21:05.481
- Hey, do you really think
that Jenny's coming after us?

21:05.525 --> 21:07.004
Because you could use us
as bait.

21:07.048 --> 21:10.225
- Yeah, we don't do that
with civilians, but thank you.

21:10.269 --> 21:11.705
- Well, we're not scared.

21:11.748 --> 21:13.576
You know, if it'll help us
solve our case,

21:13.620 --> 21:15.622
we'll do whatever.
- Guys, tap the brakes.

21:15.665 --> 21:17.101
We're not here
to solve your case.

21:17.145 --> 21:19.669
We're hunting our fugitive.
So if you want to help,

21:19.713 --> 21:22.672
give us the backstory
nice and succinct.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.326
- Sure, no problem.
- Okay.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.893
So Lisa Fanelli...
- Yes.

21:25.936 --> 21:28.330
- Was this 50-year-old
alcoholic lady

21:28.374 --> 21:29.984
who had a house
with a bunch of rooms.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.987
13 years ago,
she rented one to Jenny Betz,

21:33.030 --> 21:34.815
who said she was
a student at Brown.

21:34.858 --> 21:37.252
- Yeah, they used to
party together, hang out,

21:37.296 --> 21:39.863
then one day, Lisa disappears.

21:39.907 --> 21:42.692
The cops question everybody,
including Jenny.

21:42.736 --> 21:45.608
No one knows where she went.
Lisa was also kind of a mess,

21:45.652 --> 21:47.958
so the cops weren't
too bothered about it.

21:48.002 --> 21:51.527
- Everyone basically forgets
about her till six months ago.

21:51.571 --> 21:53.355
- And what happened
six months ago?

21:53.399 --> 21:57.272
- Rich guy in Newport having
his pool taken out and boom.

21:57.316 --> 22:01.407
Workers find a bag of bones,
and it's Lisa.

22:01.450 --> 22:02.625
So the cops are like,

22:02.669 --> 22:05.672
"Uh, oops.
Um, this is a homicide."

22:05.715 --> 22:07.064
And they want
to interview the people

22:07.108 --> 22:09.371
that Lisa was hanging with
last time they saw her.

22:09.415 --> 22:10.807
- So they look for Jenny

22:10.851 --> 22:12.374
and figure out
that's not her real name.

22:12.418 --> 22:14.376
- Yeah, they try to
pull her transcript at Brown,

22:14.420 --> 22:16.030
and there was none.

22:16.073 --> 22:18.380
She was never enrolled there,
but she was going to classes.

22:18.424 --> 22:21.035
How psycho is that?
- It's wish fulfillment.

22:21.078 --> 22:22.906
If you're going to create
a new identity,

22:22.950 --> 22:25.474
might as well be the one
you wish you had.

22:25.518 --> 22:26.823
- Bingo.

22:26.867 --> 22:28.782
We also found the real Jenny's
birth certificate.

22:28.825 --> 22:32.568
She grew up in Boston
to an Erin and Adrian Betz.

22:32.612 --> 22:35.397
There is an Erin Betz in
her 60s living in Worcester.

22:35.441 --> 22:36.659
We think it's her mom,

22:36.703 --> 22:38.400
but, you know,
she's not gonna talk to us.

22:38.444 --> 22:39.923
- Did you have an address?

22:39.967 --> 22:41.621
- Yeah, but she's probably
not gonna talk to you either.

22:41.664 --> 22:43.797
- We're the FBI.
She'll talk to us.

22:43.840 --> 22:45.102
- [chuckles]

22:45.146 --> 22:47.757
- Can we tell Andrew?
I feel like we should.

22:47.801 --> 22:50.804
- And Andrew is?
- Lisa Fanelli's son.

22:50.847 --> 22:53.023
He's more obsessed
with this than we are

22:53.067 --> 22:54.677
and he lives in Boston now too.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.505
- Hana, you and Ortiz
take the son.

22:56.549 --> 22:57.811
Kristin and I will
go talk to Jenny's mother.

22:57.854 --> 22:59.378
- You guys are leaving?

22:59.421 --> 23:00.857
- We'll stick some plainclothes
cops outside overnight.

23:00.901 --> 23:02.424
You'll be safe.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

23:02.468 --> 23:04.426
Can we at least grab a selfie?

23:04.470 --> 23:05.949
both:
No.

23:05.993 --> 23:07.603
[suspenseful music]

23:07.647 --> 23:09.475
- Yeah, I've seen the website.

23:09.518 --> 23:12.521
Those two jerks are confusing
my Jenny with someone else.

23:12.565 --> 23:15.568
So please, just go.

23:15.611 --> 23:17.787
- Mrs. Betz, we understand,

23:17.831 --> 23:20.355
and you're absolutely right,
this is not about your Jenny.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.836
13 years ago,
someone stole her identity.

23:22.879 --> 23:25.839
That person's now wanted
in at least three murders.

23:25.882 --> 23:27.318
- What?

23:27.362 --> 23:30.147
- This woman's on the run,
and we're looking for her.

23:30.191 --> 23:32.672
Please, we really
need your help.

23:36.066 --> 23:37.851
- I knew Jenny was shady.

23:37.894 --> 23:39.853
Paid her rent in cash,
partied with my mom.

23:39.896 --> 23:41.376
How many
college students you know

23:41.420 --> 23:42.986
party with 50-year-old women?

23:43.030 --> 23:44.597
- Well, maybe they do it if
the woman's paying for things.

23:44.640 --> 23:46.729
- Exactly, and it was bad.

23:46.773 --> 23:48.427
I checked my mom's
bank statements.

23:48.470 --> 23:50.429
Huge cash withdrawals
late at night.

23:50.472 --> 23:53.910
I told my mom to confront Jenny
about it and she did.

23:53.954 --> 23:56.043
Next day, she disappeared.

23:56.086 --> 23:59.002
Jenny said she didn't know
where she'd gone,

23:59.046 --> 24:01.831
and the cops believed her.
Here.

24:01.875 --> 24:03.572
One day, I snuck in
to Jenny's apartment.

24:03.616 --> 24:06.053
I found that original photo
tucked away in a drawer.

24:06.096 --> 24:07.663
I took a picture of it
with my phone.

24:07.707 --> 24:10.666
That's Jenny,
and that's her little sister.

24:10.710 --> 24:13.190
Now, look at the writing
on the back.

24:13.234 --> 24:17.630
- "To the world's best sister.
Love, Rose."

24:17.673 --> 24:19.719
- And you think
that's important, why?

24:19.762 --> 24:21.764
- It was another one
of her lies.

24:21.808 --> 24:25.202
Jenny said she didn't have
any siblings.

24:25.246 --> 24:29.206
- Mrs. Betz, do you recognize
any of these people?

24:29.250 --> 24:31.208
- Oh, my God,
that's Delia Holby.

24:31.252 --> 24:32.688
- How do you know her?

24:32.732 --> 24:34.690
- She was a classmate
of Jenny's at Treetops,

24:34.734 --> 24:36.475
and I hated her.

24:36.518 --> 24:38.825
Always in trouble
for drugs or drinking.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.217
She made terrible grades.

24:40.261 --> 24:44.047
Rumor was she was sleeping
with one of the teachers.

24:44.091 --> 24:45.440
- Did Jenny tell you that?

24:45.484 --> 24:47.224
- Yes, and I warned her
to stay away from Delia,

24:47.268 --> 24:48.922
but she wouldn't listen.

24:48.965 --> 24:52.012
She should've
'cause I was right.

24:52.055 --> 24:53.927
- About what?
What do you mean?

24:53.970 --> 24:56.843
- Jenny was afraid of boats.

24:56.886 --> 24:58.801
She never would've
gotten on one alone,

24:58.845 --> 25:00.063
much less at night.

25:00.107 --> 25:01.717
I think Delia was with her,

25:01.761 --> 25:04.851
and I think she pushed
my Jenny overboard.

25:04.894 --> 25:06.069
- What makes you think that?

25:06.113 --> 25:08.071
- The school said
they were together a lot,

25:08.115 --> 25:10.073
and there'd even been
some arguments.

25:10.117 --> 25:11.771
The weekend before Jenny died,

25:11.814 --> 25:13.903
they got caught
sneaking off campus together.

25:13.947 --> 25:16.253
My gut told me
something wasn't right.

25:16.297 --> 25:17.777
- Did you tell the police that?

25:17.820 --> 25:20.823
- Over and over, but they said
there wasn't any evidence.

25:20.867 --> 25:23.652
And of course, Delia denied it.

25:23.696 --> 25:27.264
I got so angry.
I sued the school.

25:27.308 --> 25:30.224
They took my deposition,
and the minute

25:30.267 --> 25:31.878
I brought up
Delia and the teacher,

25:31.921 --> 25:33.140
they changed their tune.

25:33.183 --> 25:36.622
Offered me $300,000
if I'd settle and sign

25:36.665 --> 25:38.841
a confidentiality agreement.

25:38.885 --> 25:43.150
I took it.
It was my pound of flesh.

25:43.193 --> 25:46.806
- What about Delia's parents?
Ever meet them?

25:46.849 --> 25:49.025
- The father was never around,
but I knew the mother.

25:49.069 --> 25:53.769
Sylvia Holby,
low-class dirtbag.

25:53.813 --> 25:55.597
When I told her what I thought
her daughter had done,

25:55.641 --> 26:00.646
she told me to go to hell
right in front of her girls.

26:00.689 --> 26:02.169
- Did you say girls, plural?

26:02.212 --> 26:04.780
- Yes, Delia had a little
sister at the primary school.

26:04.824 --> 26:05.999
I don't remember her name,

26:06.042 --> 26:09.219
but I do remember
feeling sorry for her.

26:09.263 --> 26:11.744
With a family like that.

26:11.787 --> 26:14.007
- Well, at least we know
who we're looking for now.

26:14.050 --> 26:15.269
Hana?

26:15.312 --> 26:18.141
- All I have on Delia Holby
is a tax form

26:18.185 --> 26:19.795
from when she worked
at a cleaning service

26:19.839 --> 26:21.623
in Taconic during high school.

26:21.667 --> 26:23.625
After that,
Delia ceases to exist.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.540
- That's when she stole
Jenny Betz's identity

26:25.584 --> 26:26.846
and fled to Providence.

26:26.889 --> 26:28.630
- And then eventually
Long Island,

26:28.674 --> 26:31.111
where she became
Cassandra Mason.

26:31.154 --> 26:33.940
What about the sister, Rose?
- Still looking.

26:33.983 --> 26:36.116
- I think she's disassociating.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.292
Whatever happened to her
at Treetops was so traumatic

26:38.335 --> 26:40.816
that she never wants
to be Delia Holby again.

26:40.860 --> 26:42.644
- Could it be as simple
as she murdered Jenny Betz,

26:42.688 --> 26:44.037
and that's what
she's running from?

26:44.080 --> 26:45.778
- Maybe, but this feels
deeper than that.

26:45.821 --> 26:47.693
All the lies. All the cons.

26:47.736 --> 26:50.130
It's like she wants
to be anyone but Delia.

26:50.173 --> 26:53.612
And she only kills when someone
threatens to expose her past.

26:55.614 --> 26:58.007
What I can't figure out
is that photo.

26:58.051 --> 27:02.011
She kept it as a souvenir
after she became Jenny Betz.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.839
But if it's a reminder
of her past,

27:03.883 --> 27:05.362
why hold onto it?

27:05.406 --> 27:07.364
- Maybe the sister
has meaning for her.

27:07.408 --> 27:09.889
