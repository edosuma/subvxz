-Shut up!

Can you please tell Matt
not to leave his stuff everywhere?

Oh, honey, you know how special
your brother is.

14:02.934 --> 14:04.800
I just hate telling him what to do.

14:04.934 --> 14:05.934
Please, Mom.

14:06.867 --> 14:09.367
Well, since you asked so nicely.

Matt, could you please stop
leaving your stuff everywhere

14:14.166 --> 14:15.867

I don't know,
it's like some kind of rash.

14:55.066 --> 14:57.567
I think it's from that lotion
I borrowed from you, Lizzie.

Well, Kate, while it was fun

of us started this food fight.

Yay, I cleared my name.

16:48.066 --> 16:49.433

not really.

Okay, so what's your point?

17:22.467 --> 17:24.100
I mean, this is taking
longer than I expected.

17:24.233 --> 17:25.800
Okay, here's the thing.

17:25.934 --> 17:27.667
Maybe none of us
started the food fight,

17:27.734 --> 17:29.600
but none of us stopped it either.

But, Kate, you're such a trendsetter.

17:33.834 --> 17:35.033
If you'd tried to stop it,

17:35.166 --> 17:38.000
then people would've copied you
and stopped throwing their food, too.

17:38.133 --> 17:41.667
I hate to admit it, but you're right.
People totally want to be like me.

Okay, I really need to work
on some esteem issues.

after the baseball game.

and we were running, running, running.
