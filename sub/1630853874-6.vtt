00:15.598 --> 00:17.809
<i>Welcome back</i>
<i>to the amped-up brain</i>

00:17.892 --> 00:20.770
<i>of Sherman Oaks'</i>
<i>favorite little try-hard, Ben Gross.</i>

00:21.521 --> 00:24.149
<i>I am Andy Samberg,</i>
<i>and I'll once again be your guide</i>

00:24.232 --> 00:26.735
<i>to this kid's complicated interior life.</i>

00:27.610 --> 00:31.114
<i>Feel free to check your coats at the door,</i>
<i>folks, because our boy has no chill.</i>

00:31.197 --> 00:32.991
Let's go.

00:33.074 --> 00:35.201
<i>Indeed, Ben, let us go.</i>

00:40.331 --> 00:41.958
All right, crunch time.

00:42.500 --> 00:43.460
You got this.

00:43.960 --> 00:45.336
<i> Ever since he was little,</i>

00:45.420 --> 00:48.214
<i>Ben had wanted to go to Columbia,</i>
<i>just like his father had.</i>

00:49.507 --> 00:52.260
<i>But he knew that the only way</i>
<i>to make sure he'd get in</i>

00:52.343 --> 00:54.179
<i>was to become an academic machine.</i>

00:56.181 --> 00:59.100
Time for breakfast, my little prince.

00:59.184 --> 01:01.019
No time, Patty. I gotta get to school.

01:01.102 --> 01:03.354
You cannot think if you do not eat.

01:03.438 --> 01:07.025
You need to fuel that big,
handsome brain of yours.

01:07.108 --> 01:09.152
It's okay.
I'll just eat a jerky stick on the way.

01:09.235 --> 01:11.571
While your parents are in Arizona,

01:11.654 --> 01:15.366
I am in charge,
and you are working too hard.

01:15.450 --> 01:17.577
You must slow down.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.829
I can't. There's too much at stake.

01:19.913 --> 01:22.207
Plus, people aren't rooting
for rich kids anymore.

01:22.290 --> 01:25.585
We're in a post
<i>Operation Varsity Blues</i> society, Patty.

01:25.668 --> 01:28.254
My dad can't just buy my way
onto an Ivy League crew team

01:28.338 --> 01:29.631
like in the old days.

01:29.714 --> 01:32.008
<i>I'm sure</i>
<i>he didn't really mean it like that.</i>

01:32.092 --> 01:35.345
<i>He knows bribing your way</i>
<i>into college is wrong. I hope.</i>

01:48.566 --> 01:50.193
Hey, watch where you're going, dumbass.

01:51.528 --> 01:52.487
What'd you just call me?

01:53.154 --> 01:55.824
Nothin'. I… I was just talking to myself.

01:57.992 --> 01:59.994
Time to go to class, dumbass.

02:01.496 --> 02:03.456
-Okay.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.958
-What's up?
-You look hungry.

02:05.041 --> 02:07.627
-Do I?
-Yes. Get him. Get him.

02:07.710 --> 02:10.004
-Come on.
-<i>That doesn't even seem fun.</i>

02:10.088 --> 02:12.841
<i>Who needs</i>
<i>developmentally crucial male bonding</i>

02:12.924 --> 02:16.219
<i>when you've got an A-plus diorama</i>
<i>of the Irish Potato Famine.</i>

02:16.719 --> 02:18.930
<i>Wow, that sentence made me sad.</i>

02:23.268 --> 02:24.102
Too easy.

02:33.153 --> 02:35.071
<i>We say, "Let's play"</i>

02:55.466 --> 02:56.509
I wanted to help you out,

02:56.593 --> 02:59.762
but not as much as I wanted
to see those books fall.

03:07.353 --> 03:08.479
Ben Gross.

03:08.563 --> 03:10.815
There you are.

03:11.399 --> 03:12.525
We need to talk.

03:13.109 --> 03:15.737
I just found out
that you're taking ten classes.

03:15.820 --> 03:16.738
That's crazy.

03:16.821 --> 03:18.823
You need to drop two classes immediately.

03:18.907 --> 03:19.991
What? No.

03:20.074 --> 03:22.035
This is the second semester
of junior year.

03:22.118 --> 03:24.954
I can't slow down now.
I mean, it's almost D-Day, baby.

03:25.038 --> 03:26.748
Do not call me "baby."

03:26.831 --> 03:28.917
Sorry. It just sort of
rolled out of my mouth.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.712
Look, Ben, your schedule is untenable.
You don't have a lunch period anymore.

03:32.795 --> 03:35.423
I don't need a lunch period.
I have a system.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.092
Mm-hmm, yes,
I've seen you with your meat sticks.

03:38.176 --> 03:41.179
Look, you have until tomorrow
to drop two classes or I will drop them.

03:41.262 --> 03:42.138
You can't do this.

03:42.222 --> 03:44.474
I already did, baby.

03:45.600 --> 03:46.935
Mr. Hall-Yoshida!

03:49.020 --> 03:51.231
I'm still waiting on that college essay.

03:51.314 --> 03:53.983
Yep, I'm on it. I'm basically done.

03:54.067 --> 03:55.860
Oh, so you'll be sending it over tonight?

03:55.944 --> 03:56.945
Totally.

03:57.028 --> 03:58.988
You told me that yesterday,
and I got nothing.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.740
Probably went to spam.

04:00.823 --> 04:02.951
Don't lie to my face, little boy.

04:03.451 --> 04:04.869
Get me that essay.

04:05.745 --> 04:06.746
-You got it.
-Mm-hmm.

04:09.582 --> 04:12.502
And why are you still standing here?
Don't you have a class to get to?

04:16.047 --> 04:20.426
All right,
another fun group project this week.

04:20.510 --> 04:25.139
You're gonna create presentations based
on the next few units in your syllabus

04:25.223 --> 04:27.558
and then teach those units to the class.

04:27.642 --> 04:31.980
Wait. Are you asking us
to make lesson plans and then teach them?

04:32.063 --> 04:33.064
Isn't that your job?

04:33.147 --> 04:35.400
That's a lot
of nit-picking from you, Devi.

04:36.109 --> 04:39.904
Who do you think you are, my wife?
Sorry. Ex-wife.

04:39.988 --> 04:41.447
<i>If it wasn't clear already,</i>

04:41.531 --> 04:43.700
<i>Mr. Brighton was going through</i>
<i>an acrimonious divorce</i>,

04:43.783 --> 04:45.952
<i>and he wasn't handling it well.</i>

04:46.035 --> 04:48.913
Um, get into groups of three.

04:49.455 --> 04:50.748
Shouldn't be that hard to choose.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.376
It's like how my two sons
chose their mother.

04:53.459 --> 04:55.086
So, you wanna team up?

04:55.670 --> 04:58.464
You're the only person in class
who hates group projects as much as I do.

04:58.548 --> 05:01.009
Yeah. My last group partner
transferred classes

05:01.092 --> 05:04.053
because he claimed my emails
were "violently smug."

05:04.721 --> 05:07.015
Oh, look who it is.

05:07.098 --> 05:11.561
Two of my closest friends in school,
Crazy Devi and, uh, this dude.

05:11.644 --> 05:14.731
Trent, are you trying to be in our group
just so you can get an A?

05:14.814 --> 05:16.482
How dare you suggest that?

05:16.566 --> 05:19.610
I was coming over to say hey
and to inquire about your well-being.

05:19.694 --> 05:23.156
You can be in our group if you use your
fake ID to buy us beer whenever we want.

05:23.239 --> 05:24.073
Deal.

05:24.782 --> 05:25.616
All right.

05:26.242 --> 05:30.705
Uh, I have some free time between- 15
and- 00 a.m. tonight to work on this.

05:31.289 --> 05:33.541
-That good for you guys?
-Are you out of your mind?

05:33.624 --> 05:35.376
We're not operating
on your psycho schedule.

05:35.460 --> 05:37.462
Both of you guys
just come to my house after school.

05:37.545 --> 05:40.089
No, I can't. That's when I Zoom
with my Mandarin teacher.

05:40.673 --> 05:43.801
Okay. Trent will do your section,
and I'll just put your name on it.

05:43.885 --> 05:44.719
No.

05:45.261 --> 05:46.095
I'll be there.

05:46.179 --> 05:47.764
-Hmm.

05:48.389 --> 05:50.266
I've never gotten so close
to having to do work.

05:50.350 --> 05:52.518
<i>Okay, looks like</i>
<i>Ben's overbooked afternoon</i>

05:52.602 --> 05:54.270
<i>was now even more overbooked.</i>

05:54.771 --> 05:56.314
<i>But if anyone could do it,</i>

05:57.315 --> 05:59.359
<i>-Ben could.</i>

05:59.442 --> 06:02.070
<i> Yeesh! You okay, little dude?</i>

06:06.532 --> 06:10.495
Okay. We have to cover chapter six,
Circular Motion and Gravitation.

06:10.578 --> 06:11.579
With all dude respect,

06:11.662 --> 06:14.040
I can't do that chapter
because of religious reasons.

06:14.957 --> 06:18.961
My belief system
does not include a "round" Earth.

06:19.045 --> 06:22.006
Trent, how are you in AP physics?

06:22.090 --> 06:23.466
I just signed up.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.343
I figured if I'm gonna get a D anyway,

06:25.426 --> 06:29.222
why not get a D in an AP class
because it basically counts as a C.

06:29.305 --> 06:30.932
That's actually not that bad of a plan.

06:31.015 --> 06:33.393
It's certainly better than the one
you're working with now.

06:33.476 --> 06:35.436
It's actually not, because I do have an F.

06:35.520 --> 06:36.729
What's wrong with my plan?

06:36.813 --> 06:39.357
-It's insane.
-Because I'm taking ten classes?

06:39.440 --> 06:43.444
No, I'm taking eleven classes,
but three of them are bullshit electives.

06:43.528 --> 06:46.114
Two arts and a class
that's a nature walk once a week.

06:46.197 --> 06:49.325
-My homework was to pick up an acorn.
-You think that'll get you into Princeton?

06:49.409 --> 06:51.369
How much you smoking
on the nature walks?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.414
They might look at my résumé
and see a couple of easy A's,

06:54.497 --> 06:57.708
but it still will be better
than when you get a bunch of B's.

06:57.792 --> 06:59.919
How dare you?
I would never get a B.

07:00.002 --> 07:02.713
You will if you keep grinding away
at your bonkers schedule.

07:03.339 --> 07:06.884
I am really looking forward
to becoming Valedictorian

07:06.968 --> 07:10.847
and looking at you sitting alphabetically
with the rest of the losers at graduation.

07:10.930 --> 07:12.306
Over my dead bu--

07:12.390 --> 07:15.643
Did you just say,
"Over my dead butt"?

07:15.726 --> 07:17.520
I love that. Can I steal that from you?

07:17.603 --> 07:18.729
Devi, what--

07:19.981 --> 07:23.025
Devi, what did I tell you about closing
the door when boys are here?

07:23.109 --> 07:26.946
You do not have to worry about these two.
They barely register as boys to me.

07:28.030 --> 07:31.576
God. Fine. Rhyah's coming over for dinner.
Will you be joining us?

07:31.659 --> 07:33.995
Ugh! No, thanks.
I'll just eat some frozen crap later.

07:47.341 --> 07:49.510
All right, guys,
I'll compile our work together

07:49.594 --> 07:50.845
and send it over to Ben

07:50.928 --> 07:53.931
because obviously,
you have a better printing situation.

07:54.015 --> 07:56.642
I will buy more black ink
when we use up all the cyan.

07:56.726 --> 08:00.062
Trent and Ben, you both are
more than welcome to join if you'd like.

08:00.146 --> 08:02.857
I wish I could,
but I have six more hours of homework.

08:03.441 --> 08:05.359
Damn, six hours of homework?

08:06.777 --> 08:08.571
Are you in medical school?

08:09.197 --> 08:11.199
-It's you.
-Hey, Devi.

08:11.908 --> 08:13.534
<i>Who the dick is this?</i>

08:13.618 --> 08:15.536
<i>And why is she looking at him like that?</i>

08:15.620 --> 08:17.955
<i>Hey, Andy, John McEnroe here.</i>

08:18.039 --> 08:19.373
<i>Let me clarify.</i>

08:19.457 --> 08:22.543
<i>That's Des, and the reason why Ben</i>
<i>doesn't remember him</i>

08:22.627 --> 08:26.297
<i>is because while Devi and Des</i>
<i>were doing this at Trent's party,</i>

08:27.507 --> 08:29.300
<i>your boy was doing this.</i>

08:32.637 --> 08:35.223
<i>Oh, right,</i>
<i>the cousin who wasn't a cousin.</i>

08:35.890 --> 08:39.185
<i>Yeah, we were a bit a-durnk that night.</i>

08:39.268 --> 08:41.729
Mom, can I steal you for a moment?

08:45.733 --> 08:48.528
-Why didn't you tell me we had guests?
-I did, 30 minutes ago.

08:48.611 --> 08:51.364
But you didn't tell me
her son was coming too. God!

08:51.447 --> 08:54.951
<i>In this moment, Ben forgot</i>
<i>about his mountain of homework.</i>

08:55.034 --> 08:58.955
<i>The only thing that mattered was seeing</i>
<i>what the vibe was between these two.</i>

08:59.038 --> 09:01.874
You know what?
I'd actually love to stay for dinner.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.543
It smells amazing.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.711
-Aw.
-No doy.

09:05.795 --> 09:08.297
The cardamom is frickin' aromatic, bro.

09:08.881 --> 09:10.007
Hmm.

09:10.091 --> 09:13.261
So, Des, what a fun surprise
seeing you.

09:13.344 --> 09:14.428
What you been up to?

09:14.512 --> 09:16.389
Maybe camping
in the woods with no service?

09:16.472 --> 09:18.140
Or doing a tech cleanse in Joshua Tree?

09:18.224 --> 09:20.476
Oh, I wish he would do a tech cleanse.

09:20.560 --> 09:22.979
This kid is nonstop texting all day long.

09:23.062 --> 09:26.023
Wow. Nonstop texting?

09:26.107 --> 09:27.900
-Fascinating.
-Is it?

09:27.984 --> 09:32.446
Well, sometimes my texts don't go through
because service is spotty and stuff.

09:32.530 --> 09:33.406
Hmm.

09:33.489 --> 09:34.907
<i>Yikes.</i>

09:34.991 --> 09:36.701
<i>Now Ben was getting the picture,</i>

09:36.784 --> 09:39.120
<i>and his pangs of jealousy</i>
<i>were turning to pity</i>

09:39.203 --> 09:43.165
<i>knowing Devi had been ditched</i>
<i>by yet another pretty dummy.</i>

09:43.249 --> 09:45.126
Oh, we got big news today.

09:45.209 --> 09:47.336
-Desi, tell Nalini Auntie.
-Mom, come on, I don't need--

09:47.420 --> 09:50.298
Okay, fine. If you don't want
to brag about yourself, then I will.

09:50.798 --> 09:53.050
Des got into Stanford early.

09:53.134 --> 09:55.511
-<i> And now we're back to jealousy.</i>

09:55.595 --> 09:56.679
Are you all right, Ben?

09:56.762 --> 09:59.223
Food shouldn't be too spicy.
I added milk to yours.

09:59.307 --> 10:01.183
Oh, no, I'm… I'm okay.

10:06.772 --> 10:10.526
So, how about that dinner last night?
Someone seemed a little thirsty.

10:10.610 --> 10:12.403
Yeah. You.

10:12.486 --> 10:14.405
When you found out
that Des was going to Stanford,

10:14.488 --> 10:16.449
you were like trying so hard
to one-up him.

10:16.532 --> 10:17.617
Mmm, no, I wasn't.

10:17.700 --> 10:20.828
Yeah, you were. You started speaking
to him in Mandarin out of nowhere.

10:20.911 --> 10:21.996
Mm, I don't remember that.

10:22.747 --> 10:23.664
Mmm.

10:24.749 --> 10:26.667
I filmed it
so I can make fun of you later.

10:26.751 --> 10:31.505
<i>You don't speak Mandarin?</i>
<i>That's surprising.</i>

10:31.589 --> 10:34.216
<i>Everyone really should speak it</i>
<i>with how globalized the world is becoming.</i>

10:34.300 --> 10:39.013
Whatever. So what's your deal with him?
Do you, like, like him or something?

10:39.096 --> 10:42.558
Mmm, I dunno. Do we talk about people
we like now with each other?

10:42.642 --> 10:43.934
Yeah, why not?

10:44.018 --> 10:47.271
I mean, you see me plowing my way
through half the girls at school.

10:47.355 --> 10:50.566
Hmm. Okay. Well, it's weird.

10:50.650 --> 10:54.028
He asked me for my number,
and then I never heard from him again.

10:54.111 --> 10:56.781
But last night,
he was a little flirty, right?

10:56.864 --> 10:58.616
-With his mom? Yes.
-Ben!

10:58.699 --> 11:00.326
Yeah, maybe there was a vibe there.

11:00.409 --> 11:02.745
But it was hard to tell
with how lame you were being.

11:02.828 --> 11:05.790
"I don't know if I'm gonna apply to
Stanford. We'll see if it's a good fit."

11:05.873 --> 11:09.085
Let's be clear.
You'd give 1,000 HJs to go to Stanford.

11:09.168 --> 11:12.922
Do you want me to smack that meat tube out
of your tiny hands and beat you with it?

11:13.005 --> 11:16.425
Fine. You want my advice?
Stop trying so hard.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.470
-Just be yourself and ask him out.
-Really?

11:19.553 --> 11:22.640
Yeah. What do you have to lose?
Certainly not your dignity.

11:29.146 --> 11:31.023
Okay, guys, the moment has come.

11:31.107 --> 11:34.402
Turn in your essays
on how you <i>will</i> use calculus in real life.

11:37.947 --> 11:38.989
Wait, what?

11:39.073 --> 11:41.867
We did an essay in math?
That doesn't even make sense.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.203
It does make sense
if you're a public school teacher

11:44.286 --> 11:46.497
who's been disrespected
for almost three decades.

11:46.580 --> 11:48.374
<i> Ben had missed this assignment</i>

11:48.457 --> 11:51.544
<i>because he had started listening</i>
<i>to an audiobook of </i>King Lear

11:51.627 --> 11:53.129
<i>midway through yesterday's class.</i>

11:53.212 --> 11:55.756
-Pointless? Well, that is it.

11:55.840 --> 11:59.969
You'll all be writing an essay explaining
how you use calculus in real life.

12:01.512 --> 12:03.639
I missed it. Can I get it to you tomorrow?

12:03.723 --> 12:06.475
Calculus not a priority for you, Ben?

12:06.559 --> 12:09.061
Maybe you want to spend your time
on more practical subjects

12:09.145 --> 12:11.439
like personal finance or health?

12:11.522 --> 12:12.523
No, I just--

12:12.606 --> 12:15.401
Guess what, Ben?
You get a zero on this assignment.

12:15.484 --> 12:18.195
A zero? No,
but if I get a zero on this essay,

12:18.279 --> 12:20.656
-that will bring my grade down to a--
-B.

12:21.949 --> 12:24.660
Okay, so, Savannah,
you're the one who said, quote,

12:24.744 --> 12:28.080
"It's hella pointless to learn
this wack-ass math I'll never use."

12:28.164 --> 12:30.750
So, why don't you read your essay first?

12:31.333 --> 12:34.587
<i> The worst had happened.</i>
<i>Ben had gotten a B.</i>

12:34.670 --> 12:38.299
<i>His GPA would be pulled down</i>
<i>to the disgusting upper fours.</i>

12:38.382 --> 12:39.925
<i>But he couldn't even focus on that</i>

12:40.009 --> 12:43.471
<i>because something extraordinarily painful</i>
<i>was happening to his insides.</i>

12:47.600 --> 12:49.393
Oh, hey, you okay?

12:49.477 --> 12:52.730
I think my appendix burst.
I gotta go to the hospital.

12:52.813 --> 12:54.482
-Oh shit.

12:56.567 --> 13:00.112
Can you please carry me
in a less emasculating way?

13:00.196 --> 13:03.365
<i>Radiology tech 165 to OR3.</i>

13:04.033 --> 13:06.702
<i>Radiology tech 165 to OR3.</i>

13:06.786 --> 13:08.954
Well, Mr. Gross, it's not appendicitis.

13:09.038 --> 13:10.414
It's not? Are you sure?

13:10.498 --> 13:13.125
Where'd you do your residency?
Are you still doing it?

13:13.959 --> 13:17.296
I'm going to ignore that series
of questions and cut to the chase.

13:17.379 --> 13:19.840
It appears the pain you're experiencing

13:19.924 --> 13:23.093
is the result
of impacted fecal matter in your colon.

13:23.928 --> 13:26.847
Most likely caused by stress
and poor diet.

13:26.931 --> 13:27.890
Excuse me?

13:27.973 --> 13:31.685
W-Wait. So, like, he's full of shit?

13:31.769 --> 13:34.480
Yes,
I guess you could put it that way.

13:35.064 --> 13:37.566
<i>Yeah, not really a diagnosis</i>
<i>you want to get</i>

13:37.650 --> 13:39.568
<i>in front of the most popular kid</i>
<i>at your school.</i>

13:40.069 --> 13:42.947
When was the last time
you had a bowel movement?

13:43.030 --> 13:46.575
Uh, I don't think it's been that long,
like, if today's Thursday…

13:47.660 --> 13:48.744
Sixteen days?

13:48.828 --> 13:50.371
-<i>Oh my God.</i>
Oh my God.

13:50.454 --> 13:54.291
Okay, due to the frankly incredible volume
of waste in your body,

13:54.375 --> 13:56.585
we will need to perform
a surgical procedure

13:56.669 --> 13:57.837
to remove it immediately.

13:57.920 --> 14:00.381
Wait. What am I supposed to do?
My parents are in Phoenix.

14:00.464 --> 14:03.926
My dad's helping Devin Booker launch
his new skincare line called NBAgeless.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.888
I know. I contacted your parents,
and they referred me to your babysitter,

14:07.972 --> 14:10.850
Patty Shevchenko,
but we haven't been able to reach her.

14:10.933 --> 14:12.852
Is there another adult
who can stay with you?

14:14.144 --> 14:15.896
Um, I'm 18.

14:15.980 --> 14:19.984
I can stay while you empty
the shit from him.

14:20.067 --> 14:24.280
<i>If there is a just</i>
<i>and merciful God, just kill Ben.</i>

14:24.363 --> 14:25.865
<i>-Kill him now.</i>

14:29.034 --> 14:29.994
Mr. Gross.

14:31.954 --> 14:34.123
Mr. Gross, it was a successful procedure.

14:34.206 --> 14:35.207
How do you feel?

14:37.293 --> 14:39.295
Good. I think.

14:39.378 --> 14:43.549
Now we just need you and your adult friend
to wait here until you pass gas.

14:43.632 --> 14:46.510
<i>And the humiliation</i>
<i>keeps a-coming.</i>

14:46.594 --> 14:48.804
It's standard.
Just so we know your GI tract

14:48.888 --> 14:50.556
is functioning properly post-op.

14:51.181 --> 14:53.392
So how big a fart we talking here, Doc?

14:53.893 --> 14:55.853
Like a real sheet rustler?

14:55.936 --> 14:58.480
Always a pleasure dealing with teen boys.

15:00.608 --> 15:02.276
Well, this is mortifying.

15:03.068 --> 15:05.070
You know, I kinda thought
getting cheated on by Devi

15:05.154 --> 15:07.156
would've been the end
of our journey together.

15:07.239 --> 15:09.533
Yeah. Yet, here we are.

15:09.617 --> 15:10.993
Waiting for your farts.

15:14.914 --> 15:16.498
So, how is Devi?

15:17.625 --> 15:18.834
She's good, I guess.

15:19.627 --> 15:21.754
Actually, she kind of has
this new guy now,

15:21.837 --> 15:25.674
and weirdly he's sort of a combo
of the two of us if we were also Indian.

15:27.593 --> 15:30.679
I always wondered how she liked
both of us at the same time.

15:31.180 --> 15:33.265
You know, because we're so different.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.935
Yeah, you're a cool hunk,
and I'm a friendless dweeb. I get it.

15:36.018 --> 15:37.937
No, I… I didn't mean it like that.

15:39.188 --> 15:41.982
I actually used to be
kinda jealous of you.

15:42.066 --> 15:43.484
Huh? Why?

15:43.567 --> 15:45.694
Because you're smart like she is.

15:46.236 --> 15:49.198
That's, like, a connection
I could never have.

15:49.907 --> 15:50.741
Yeah, well,

15:51.492 --> 15:53.827
being smart isn't all that
it's cracked up to be.

15:53.911 --> 15:55.913
You probably don't go
to the hospital very often

15:55.996 --> 15:57.915
with stress-induced constipation.

15:57.998 --> 16:01.085
No, I definitely don't.

16:03.921 --> 16:06.048
So, why are you so stressed out?

16:06.131 --> 16:08.634
Oh, I don't know.
Maybe because my entire life trajectory

16:08.717 --> 16:10.719
is determined by the outcome
of the next six months.

16:11.512 --> 16:14.890
Are you talking about college?
Dude, you'll get into college.

16:14.974 --> 16:17.142
I don't want to get into just any college.

16:17.226 --> 16:20.980
I want to go to Columbia,
and I'm not sure if I can get in.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.190
So then you don't get in. Who cares?

16:23.273 --> 16:24.274
No, not "who cares?"

16:24.358 --> 16:26.694
-I have to get in.
-Or what?

16:26.777 --> 16:29.196
Or all this work was for nothing.
My future is ruined,

16:29.279 --> 16:32.700
and I disappoint myself,
and my family, and, you know, my dad.

16:33.325 --> 16:35.202
This is all about your dad?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.579
Dude, tell him to go to hell.

16:37.663 --> 16:41.166
You work so hard,
you haven't had time to shit in two weeks.

16:41.250 --> 16:43.419
If I was your dad, I'd be proud of you.

16:44.753 --> 16:47.214
Not because
of the not shitting part

16:47.297 --> 16:49.758
but because of the hardworking part.

16:51.093 --> 16:54.013
Thanks. Let's change the subject.
What are you working on?

16:54.096 --> 16:56.223
Ugh. This stupid college essay.

16:56.932 --> 16:58.100
The question sucks.

16:58.183 --> 17:01.186
"Discuss an event
that shaped you into who you are."

17:01.937 --> 17:03.439
I just… I don't know how to answer it.

17:03.522 --> 17:05.649
Hmm. Do you not know what an event is?

17:05.733 --> 17:07.735
What the fuck, man?

17:07.818 --> 17:09.778
I know what an event is, dude.

17:11.113 --> 17:12.114
I just…

17:13.741 --> 17:16.035
I don't really know who I am.

17:16.118 --> 17:18.787
Gimme a break. What do you mean
you don't know who you are?

17:18.871 --> 17:21.373
You're the only person
at our school who's not a nobody.

17:21.457 --> 17:23.500
The lunch ladies
named a dessert after you.

17:23.584 --> 17:26.962
Yeah, that's all surface stuff.
That's not who I am.

17:27.755 --> 17:29.923
Okay. Then who are you?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.050
I don't know.

17:31.925 --> 17:34.219
Like, I think
I'm someone…

17:35.679 --> 17:38.057
Forget it. This is embarrassing.

17:38.140 --> 17:42.144
You can't possibly embarrass yourself
more than I have tonight, so get over it.

17:42.644 --> 17:44.646
What do you know is true about yourself?

17:44.730 --> 17:47.691
I mean, I'm a really good brother.

17:48.567 --> 17:51.820
Maybe I could talk about
when my sister was adopted. I--

17:51.904 --> 17:55.074
Wait, you have an adopted sister?
That's essay gold.

17:55.616 --> 17:57.242
Okay. Why don't you start making a list

17:57.326 --> 17:59.745
of all the ways that she's helped you
learn about yourself?

18:00.245 --> 18:03.082
Come on. I can… help you.

18:07.586 --> 18:10.214
<i>And so,</i>
<i>after a humiliating afternoon,</i>

18:10.297 --> 18:11.924
<i>things started to look up.</i>

18:12.007 --> 18:14.968
<i>Not only did Ben finally get</i>
<i>some much-needed male bonding,</i>

18:15.052 --> 18:18.138
<i>but also his fart arrived quietly</i>
<i>in the night,</i>

18:18.222 --> 18:21.058
<i>rustling nary a sheet nor a nostril.</i>

18:28.899 --> 18:29.733
Hey, champ.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.365
Dad? Why aren't you in Arizona?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.117
Because my kid was in the hospital.

18:38.200 --> 18:39.118
You okay?

18:39.201 --> 18:41.954
Yeah. Yeah, I'm all right.

18:42.037 --> 18:44.373
The doctor said this was caused by stress.

18:44.915 --> 18:47.668
Sounds like you might be a workaholic
like your old man.

18:47.751 --> 18:48.585
Yeah.

18:50.170 --> 18:52.297
But, um, actually,

18:53.006 --> 18:54.341
I don't think I want to be.

18:56.260 --> 18:58.303
Dad, I'm gonna scale my schedule back,

18:58.929 --> 19:01.974
but that also might hurt my chances
of getting into Columbia.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.852
And I know how much that means to you.

19:05.853 --> 19:06.687
You know,

19:07.646 --> 19:12.192
half the reason
I've worked so hard my whole life

19:12.901 --> 19:15.487
was to make my dad proud of me.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.575
I mean, he's been dead 30 years,

19:19.658 --> 19:22.452
and I'm still trying
to impress the son of a bitch.

19:23.787 --> 19:26.373
Ben, I'm proud of you.

19:27.249 --> 19:28.709
Wherever you go to college,

19:28.792 --> 19:31.211
whatever you do in this life,

19:31.753 --> 19:32.880
I'm proud of you.

19:32.963 --> 19:34.548
Come on, Dad.

19:34.631 --> 19:35.591
No, I mean it.

19:36.717 --> 19:37.926
And I want you to hear it.

19:38.886 --> 19:42.139
I know I haven't always been the best dad,

19:43.473 --> 19:46.560
but this is where I can
be better than mine.

19:47.936 --> 19:50.355
You are a brilliant boy.

19:51.773 --> 19:53.358
And I really love you.

19:54.193 --> 19:56.069
I love you too, Dad.

19:57.112 --> 20:00.407
<i> Finally, Ben heard the words</i>
<i>he'd been longing to hear.</i>

20:00.490 --> 20:03.577
<i>And for the first time</i>
<i>since probably preschool,</i>

20:03.660 --> 20:05.329
<i>he didn't feel stressed at all.</i>

20:08.790 --> 20:12.211
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>Ben was lighter in more ways than one.</i>

20:12.294 --> 20:13.837
Morning, Principal Grubbs.

20:13.921 --> 20:17.257
I've decided to drop
AP Calculus BC and statistics.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.467
Good.

20:18.967 --> 20:21.261
I'm so glad
you came to your senses.

20:21.345 --> 20:25.432
<i>Ben finally realized</i>
<i>that Columbia was not the end-all be-all.</i>

20:25.515 --> 20:29.353
Would it be okay if I added
an elective though? Maybe art studio?

20:29.436 --> 20:31.480
<i>But he was still going to apply.</i>

20:31.563 --> 20:32.606
Fine.

20:33.106 --> 20:35.108
Paxton! Oh!

20:36.777 --> 20:38.570
Great job on the essay.

20:38.654 --> 20:39.613
Very moving.

20:40.113 --> 20:42.783
I didn't know
you could actually be so deep.

20:42.866 --> 20:43.700
I cried.

20:44.701 --> 20:46.245
-Really?
-Mm-hmm.

20:53.835 --> 20:54.670
Hey.

20:54.753 --> 20:55.796
Oh, hey.

20:56.421 --> 20:58.507
Guess what? Des and I are going on a date.

20:58.590 --> 21:02.886
-Wow. Did you blackmail him or something?
-Even worse. I took your advice.

21:02.970 --> 21:06.682
I texted him and asked him if he wanted
to get FroYo sometime, and he said yes.

21:07.307 --> 21:09.643
So, while it pains me to say this,

21:10.143 --> 21:10.978
thank you.

21:11.061 --> 21:14.022
<i> This would normally prompt</i>
<i>a twinge of jealousy in Ben,</i>

21:14.648 --> 21:16.275
<i>but if last night taught him anything,</i>

21:16.358 --> 21:19.111
<i>it was that he needed to let go</i>
<i>of whatever caused him pain.</i>

21:19.194 --> 21:20.404
Do you wanna sit down?

21:20.988 --> 21:23.657
No. I'm just grabbing a soda before class.

21:24.658 --> 21:26.910
You know, I hope you don't blow it
with that guy, David.

21:26.994 --> 21:28.370
He could be your meal ticket.

21:28.453 --> 21:31.790
He wishes. I'm gonna be the first
ethical billionaire, like Rihanna.

21:31.873 --> 21:33.250
No such thing.

21:38.130 --> 21:38.964
What the hell?

21:39.047 --> 21:41.675
Yo, I heard you helped
my best friend last night.

21:44.344 --> 21:45.804
-Um…

21:45.887 --> 21:49.891
Any friend of my friend
is also my friend.

21:49.975 --> 21:51.435
Oh, it's cool, Trent.

21:51.518 --> 21:53.687
Noice. Wanna hang with us?

21:53.770 --> 21:55.272
Like with you and the Hot Pocket?

21:55.856 --> 21:58.066
-I don't know what that is.
-Oh, it's, uh…

21:59.192 --> 22:01.069
Never mind. Yeah, sure.

22:01.153 --> 22:02.446
All right, come on.

22:03.322 --> 22:05.949
<i>And while Ben's future</i>
<i>was still undecided,</i>

22:06.450 --> 22:09.369
<i>he was presently enjoying</i>
<i>his youth for once.</i>

22:09.870 --> 22:12.080
<i>All right, McEnroe, get back in here.</i>

22:12.581 --> 22:15.208
<i>Vacation's over,</i>
<i>you handsome son of a bitch.</i>
