01:09.330 --> 01:10.418

DIDN'T YOU AND HER

I'M NOTIFYING ZEKE
ABOUT WHAT I LEARNED

01:34.181 --> 01:36.618
AND HE CAN DEAL WITH
VERONICA'S NONSENSE.

01:36.661 --> 01:40.361
LOOK, BOTH OF YOU,
HEAR ME.

01:40.404 --> 01:43.581
I'M STILL LEAVING BRINGSTON
AT THE END OF THE TERM

01:43.625 --> 01:48.543
AND I DON'T NEED ANYONE
INTERFERING IN MY BUSINESS.

01:49.457 --> 01:50.762
I LEARNED MY LESSON.

01:50.806 --> 01:52.373
THIS IS A MEDDLE-FREE TRIP.

01:52.416 --> 01:55.724
YEAH, OK.
I'LL BELIEVE IT
WHEN I SEE IT.

01:55.767 --> 01:56.899
OK. I GOT CLASS,

01:56.942 --> 01:59.162
BUT WE'RE STILL ON
FOR LUNCH.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.511
LOVE Y'ALL.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.643
LOVE YOU.

02:03.558 --> 02:05.560
AND I GOT SCHOOL.

02:05.603 --> 02:06.952
IT'S SERVICE WEEK

02:06.996 --> 02:08.606
AND THE TEAM
IS COACHING

02:08.650 --> 02:10.478
SOME LOCAL
HIGH SCHOOLERS.

02:10.521 --> 02:12.610
ARE YOU OK?
WHEN I CAME IN,

02:12.654 --> 02:13.742
IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU HAD THE

02:13.785 --> 02:15.657
WEIGHT OF THE WORLD
ON YOUR SHOULDERS.

02:15.700 --> 02:16.571
I'M FINE.

02:16.614 --> 02:17.702
THAT'S THE BEST
YOU CAN DO?

02:17.746 --> 02:20.140
MOM, IT'S NOTHING BIG.

02:20.183 --> 02:21.663
-REALLY.
-OK.

02:25.536 --> 02:28.191
HOW ARE YOU, MOM?
ARE YOU GOOD?

02:28.235 --> 02:29.497
HONESTLY? BEING SINGLE

02:29.540 --> 02:31.499
AFTER ALL THESE YEARS
IS SCARY,

02:31.542 --> 02:35.546
BUT THERE'S SOMETHING
STRANGELY FREEING ABOUT IT.

02:35.590 --> 02:37.853
I'M GLAD.
FOR REAL.

02:37.896 --> 02:40.160
I CAN'T WAIT TO SHOW YOU
THE APARTMENT TONIGHT.

02:40.203 --> 02:42.205
I'M EVEN MAKING
YOUR FAVORITE.

02:42.249 --> 02:43.989
UH-OH. I'M ABOUT
TO EAT MY WEIGHT

02:44.033 --> 02:45.687
IN SPAGHETTI AND MEATBALLS.
YOU KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

02:45.730 --> 02:48.472
YEAH.

02:48.516 --> 02:50.648
HEY, MOM,

OH, YES.
THE OTHER STAR

02:54.652 --> 02:56.219
OF THE BRINGSTON LIONS.

02:56.263 --> 02:57.786
I DON'T KNOW
ABOUT ALL THAT, BUT

02:57.829 --> 02:59.918
WE DO HAVE A NEW
HOTSHOT OUTFIELDER.

02:59.962 --> 03:02.138
WELL, YOU KNOW,
WHAT CAN I SAY?

03:02.182 --> 03:03.879
YOU'RE VERY HUMBLE.

03:03.922 --> 03:05.576
LOOK, I GOTTA HEAD BACK
TO THE KAPPA HOUSE,

03:05.620 --> 03:07.274
BUT DAMON HAS
A FEW QUESTIONS

03:07.317 --> 03:10.102
ABOUT YOUR TIME HERE
AT BRINGSTON IF IT'S COOL.

03:10.146 --> 03:13.018
OH. SURE.
I HOPE I CAN HELP.

03:13.062 --> 03:14.542
-I'LL SEE YOU TONIGHT.
-ALL RIGHT, MOM.

03:14.585 --> 03:16.065
-ALL RIGHT, BABY.
-ALL RIGHT, BRO.

03:16.108 --> 03:17.153
YEAH.

03:17.197 --> 03:18.415
UH, LET ME GET
YOUR PLATE.

03:18.459 --> 03:19.547
THANK YOU.

03:21.766 --> 03:24.595
-HAVE A SEAT.
-YES, MA'AM.

03:24.639 --> 03:26.206
SO, WHAT CAN I
HELP YOU WITH?

03:26.249 --> 03:27.729
I WAS JUST WONDERING,
HAVE YOU EVER VISITED

03:27.772 --> 03:30.340
A COFFEE SHOP CALLED
PEACH BREW CAFE?

03:30.384 --> 03:33.517
OH, I LOVED THAT PLACE.

03:33.561 --> 03:35.084
YEAH, MY ADOPTIVE DAD

03:35.127 --> 03:36.520
USED TO VISIT
ATLANTA A LOT

03:36.564 --> 03:38.000
AND HE LOVED
THAT PLACE, TOO.

03:38.043 --> 03:39.915
OH.

03:39.958 --> 03:43.527
UH, HIS NAME WAS
XAVIER WILSON.

03:43.571 --> 03:45.529
I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU KNEW HIM.

03:45.573 --> 03:46.922
-WILSON?
-YEAH.

03:46.965 --> 03:49.316
I THOUGHT YOUR
LAST NAME WAS SIMS.

03:49.359 --> 03:52.188
OH, NO, MY MOM THOUGHT
HER MAIDEN NAME

03:52.232 --> 03:55.147
HAD A BETTER RING
FOR BRANDING PURPOSES.

03:55.191 --> 03:56.801
APPARENTLY,
"DAMON SIMS" HAS MORE

03:56.845 --> 03:58.586
STAR POWER THAN
"DAMON WILSON."

03:59.717 --> 04:02.590
SHE'S RIGHT.
IT'S A GOOD NAME.

04:06.507 --> 04:08.596
OH, UM...SORRY, I

04:08.639 --> 04:10.293
DIDN'T REALIZE
HOW LATE IT WAS.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.773
I HAVE A MEETING.

PRESIDENT ALLEN'S

04:59.734 --> 05:02.258
THANK YOU ALL

05:02.302 --> 05:04.565
AND VOLUNTEERING FOR
BRINGSTON'S SERVICE WEEK

05:04.608 --> 05:06.262
AND OUR ANNUAL

05:06.306 --> 05:08.351
"MAKE YOUR MATCH"
MENTORING EVENT.

05:08.395 --> 05:10.353
THE YOUNG PEOPLE YOU'RE

THE HBCU EXPERIENCE

05:19.014 --> 05:21.277
AND POTENTIALLY
ALTER THEIR LIFE PATH.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.715
AND I MAY BE BIASED, BUT
YOU'RE ALSO IN GOOD HANDS

05:24.759 --> 05:25.760
WITH THIS YEAR'S
EVENT ORGANIZER

05:25.803 --> 05:27.327
MS. KEISHA McCALLA.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.895
THANK YOU.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.725

INSTRUCTIONS VIA EMAIL,

05:34.769 --> 05:36.336
SO, YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

05:36.379 --> 05:38.163
GROUP LEADERS,
PLEASE COME TO
THE WELCOME DESK

05:38.207 --> 05:39.817

YOUR PACKETS,

05:39.861 --> 05:41.123
AND REMEMBER, Y'ALL,
THESE KIDS ARE WILD,

05:41.166 --> 05:45.040
SO, PLEASE JUST
KEEP THEM ON LOCK. HA!

05:46.824 --> 05:47.956
YOU DID GOOD
IN THERE.

05:47.999 --> 05:50.045
I DID, DIDN'T I?

05:50.088 --> 05:51.786
I GOT A TRUSTEE
MEETING, BUT

05:51.829 --> 05:53.265
WHAT HAPPENED TO
GIVING ME DATES

05:53.309 --> 05:54.876
FOR OUR JOINT
THERAPY SESSION?

05:54.919 --> 05:56.834
UM, I ACTUALLY DON'T
THINK MY THERAPIST AND I

05:56.878 --> 05:58.401
ARE A GOOD FIT ANYMORE.

05:58.445 --> 06:00.316
WE'RE JUST REALLY NOT
ON THE SAME WAVELENGTH.

06:00.360 --> 06:01.709
THERAPY ISN'T
A QUICK FIX.

06:01.752 --> 06:02.710
IT'S MOST EFFECTIVE
WHEN YOU...

06:02.753 --> 06:04.276
OH, SORRY, DAD.

06:04.320 --> 06:05.669
ACTUALLY, I HAVE TO
GO HELP SIMONE OUT

06:05.713 --> 06:06.844
WITH SOME VOLUNTEER STUFF,

06:06.888 --> 06:09.107
BUT I'LL LET YOU
KNOW IF--

06:09.151 --> 06:11.762
WHEN I GET MY
NEW THERAPIST...

06:11.806 --> 06:12.850
OH!

06:12.894 --> 06:14.765
PLEASE SAVE ME

06:14.809 --> 06:16.376
FROM MY OVERLY
INVESTED FATHER.

06:17.551 --> 06:19.248
DO TELL.

06:19.291 --> 06:20.815
NOTHING WORTH DISCUSSING.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.818
BUT...ARE YOU OK THEN?

06:23.861 --> 06:25.646
WHY DOES EVERYONE
KEEP ASKING ME THAT?

06:25.689 --> 06:27.082
YOUR AURA IS OFF.

06:28.866 --> 06:30.868
IT'S DAMON, ISN'T IT?

06:30.912 --> 06:33.044
Y'ALL ARE ALL KINDS
OF AWKWARD.

06:33.088 --> 06:34.568
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
KEEPING YOUR DISTANCE.

06:34.611 --> 06:36.787
I MEAN, I'M TRYING.
THE BROTHER IS EVERYWHERE.

06:36.831 --> 06:38.398
CLASS, STUDY HALL,
THE GYM.

06:38.441 --> 06:39.921
GIRL, IT'S GONNA BE
A HARD 4 YEARS

06:39.964 --> 06:40.835
IF YOU DON'T LEARN
HOW TO COEXIST.

06:40.878 --> 06:42.967
MAN, YOU'RE TELLING ME.

06:43.011 --> 06:44.447
WHY ARE WE GOING
THE OTHER WAY AGAIN?

06:44.491 --> 06:46.493
THAT IS MY EX LISA
AND THAT'S A CONVERSATION

06:46.536 --> 06:48.277
I AM NOT IN THE MOOD
TO HAVE RIGHT NOW.

06:48.320 --> 06:50.061
I'M SORRY.
WHAT HAPPENED
TO COEXISTING??

06:50.105 --> 06:52.803
COEXISTING. .

06:52.847 --> 06:54.065
OK.

06:58.113 --> 07:00.768
HEY. YOUR CHOREOGRAPHER
HAS ARRIVED.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.814
HOW YOU DOING?
I COME BRINGING
MY DOPEST MOVES.

07:03.858 --> 07:05.425
WE'LL SEE ABOUT THAT.

07:06.426 --> 07:07.992
YOU'RE VOLUNTEERING
FOR THE STEP SHOW?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.994
JUST LIKE LAST YEAR,
REMEMBER?

07:10.038 --> 07:11.518
NO. THAT'S ACTUALLY

07:11.561 --> 07:13.520
NOT WHAT I REMEMBER
ABOUT LAST YEAR.

07:15.913 --> 07:17.393
CAN Y'ALL EXCUSE US
FOR A SECOND?

07:21.876 --> 07:24.226
I GET THAT YOU'RE STILL
MAD ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED,

07:24.269 --> 07:27.098
BUT CAN WE PLEASE PUT ASIDE
OUR DRAMA AND WORK TOGETHER?

07:27.142 --> 07:30.232
SURE. FOR THE KIDS.

07:31.886 --> 07:33.714
HEY, THEA, HOLD UP.

07:35.890 --> 07:37.544
JUST A SPLASH.

07:37.587 --> 07:39.241
LET ME SHOW YOU
SOMETHING REAL QUICK.

07:39.284 --> 07:40.677
WAIT. I THINK
WE SHOULD GO BACK.

07:40.721 --> 07:42.766
COME ON. CHILL.

07:42.810 --> 07:44.464
MISSED SEEING
YOUR PRETTY FACE.

07:44.507 --> 07:46.857
THINGS GOT A LITTLE
DRAMATIC AT THE PARTY, BUT--

07:46.901 --> 07:48.163
-STOP.
-WAIT, WHAT...

07:48.206 --> 07:49.860
STOP. STOP. STOP!

07:49.904 --> 07:51.645
GET THE HELL OFF HER!

07:51.688 --> 07:53.603
WE'RE OK, RIGHT?
I MEAN,

07:53.647 --> 07:55.126
I'D STILL LOVE TO
KICK IT WITH YOU SOMETIME.

07:55.170 --> 07:59.217
NO, I--I--
I NEED TO GO.

08:10.707 --> 08:12.622
THEA'S NOT FEELING WELL,
SO, I'M TAKING OVER.

08:12.666 --> 08:13.841
-IS SHE OK?
-IT'S THEA,

08:13.884 --> 08:15.190
SO, IT'S HARD TO TELL.

08:15.233 --> 08:16.713
Y'ALL SHOULD'VE
RECEIVED AN EMAIL

08:16.757 --> 08:18.585
WITH YOUR COURT AND MENTEE
PLAYER ASSIGNMENTS.

08:18.628 --> 08:20.500
WORK THEM THROUGH
THE DRILLS TODAY.

08:20.543 --> 08:22.937
BASED ON MY ASSESSMENT
OF YOUR MENTEE'S SKILL LEVEL,

08:22.980 --> 08:24.286
I'LL CREATE A ROSTER
FOR TOMORROW'S

08:24.329 --> 08:25.983
PRINCESS OF
THE COURT MATCH.

08:44.872 --> 08:47.265
HEY. YOU MUST BE MYA.
IT'S NICE TO MEET YOU.

08:47.309 --> 08:49.093
YEAH, WE SHOULD
PROBABLY GET STARTED.

08:49.137 --> 08:50.921
WE DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF TIME.

08:50.965 --> 08:52.880
RIGHT. WELL,
I WAS THINKING

08:52.923 --> 08:54.490
WE COULD START WITH
SOME VOLLEY DRILLS.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.927
I THOUGHT THIS WEEKEND
WAS MEANT TO CHALLENGE US.

08:56.971 --> 09:00.278
OK. CHANGE OF PLANS THEN.

09:00.322 --> 09:03.368
GROUNDSTROKE TECHNIQUES
AND PUTAWAY SHOTS.

09:03.412 --> 09:04.674
LET'S SEE WHAT YOU GOT.

09:04.718 --> 09:06.676
BET. LET'S DO IT.

09:14.989 --> 09:16.599
AHEM. EXCUSE ME, SIR.

09:16.643 --> 09:18.514
SHOULDN'T YOU BE OFF
SHAPING YOUNG MINDS?

09:18.558 --> 09:20.777
OH, YOU BEST BELIEVE
I WILL BE.

09:20.821 --> 09:23.432
RIGHT AFTER ROLAND'S
LITTLE BATHROOM BREAK.

09:23.475 --> 09:26.087
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.
WHERE YOU BEEN HIDING?

09:26.130 --> 09:29.394
BETWEEN CLASSES,
RIDING THE BENCH
AT FOOTBALL PRACTICE,

09:29.438 --> 09:31.440
AND ALL OF
GABBY'S REHEARSALS,

09:31.483 --> 09:33.050
I'VE BARELY HAD
TIME TO SLEEP.

09:33.094 --> 09:35.052
SO, IT'S GABBY NOW,
IS IT?

09:37.838 --> 09:39.143
YO, KEISH,

09:39.187 --> 09:40.405
YOU THE ONE
WHO SAID YOU WEREN'T

09:40.449 --> 09:42.016
INTERESTED IN AN "US"

09:42.059 --> 09:43.670
BECAUSE YOU HAD TO
WORK ON YOU.

09:43.713 --> 09:45.062
UNLESS THAT'S CHANGED...

09:48.283 --> 09:49.632
THEN IT'S REALLY
NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS

09:49.676 --> 09:51.460
WHAT GABBY AND I DO.

09:51.503 --> 09:53.593
I'LL CATCH YOU LATER.
HEY, ROLAND.

09:59.207 --> 10:02.645
HEY. HEY, THIS IS, LIKE,
MY THIRD MESSAGE, MAN.

10:02.689 --> 10:04.778
I'M TRYING TO SEE IF YOU
TALKED TO YOUR MOMS YET.

10:06.693 --> 10:10.087
LOOK, WE NEED TO TALK.
JUST HIT ME BACK, ALL RIGHT?

10:10.131 --> 10:13.351
HEY, UH, COACH,
YOU GOT A SEC?

10:13.395 --> 10:15.092
HEY. WHAT'S UP, SIMS?

10:15.136 --> 10:18.095
UM, LOOK, I NORMALLY
DON'T DO THIS, BUT

10:18.139 --> 10:19.662
ARE YOU COOL WITH ME
SITTING OUT TODAY?

10:19.706 --> 10:20.968
WAIT A MINUTE.
IS THIS WHERE YOU'RE

10:21.011 --> 10:22.012
TELLING ME YOU'RE
QUITTING MY TEAM?

10:22.056 --> 10:23.579
NO, NO, COACH. IT'S--

10:23.623 --> 10:25.929
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT. JUST...

10:25.973 --> 10:28.149
YOU WANT TO TALK
ABOUT IT, SON?

10:28.192 --> 10:29.803
-NOT REALLY.
-HEY, COACH.

10:29.846 --> 10:31.239
THE MENTEES ARE
READY FOR YOU
ON THE FIELD.

10:31.282 --> 10:33.545
GOT IT.
ALL RIGHT, WELL,

10:33.589 --> 10:35.504
YOU TAKE YOUR DAY, SIMS.
BUT I WANT YOU BACK

10:35.547 --> 10:37.854
ON THAT MOUND TOMORROW
READY TO GO, SON.

10:37.898 --> 10:39.682
THANKS, COACH.

10:39.726 --> 10:40.770
ALL RIGHT.

10:43.730 --> 10:45.688
COACH LOWE, WHY IS
THE DEAN'S OFFICE

10:45.732 --> 10:47.298
SENDING ME EMAILS SAYING
THEY HAVEN'T RECEIVED

10:47.342 --> 10:48.778
THE TEAM'S
STUDY HALL LOGS?

10:48.822 --> 10:50.084
I DON'T KNOW.
I PUT IT

10:50.127 --> 10:51.259
ON YOUR DESK
FOR YOUR SIGNATURE.

10:51.302 --> 10:53.522
IF THAT WERE TRUE,
I WOULD'VE SEEN THEM.

10:53.565 --> 10:55.132
LISTEN, IF YOU CAN'T
GET THINGS DONE

10:55.176 --> 10:58.005
WHEN I ASK YOU TO,
I'LL FIND SOMEONE WHO CAN.

11:01.922 --> 11:03.271
HA HA HA!...

11:03.314 --> 11:05.447
ZEKE, WE NEED TO TALK.

11:05.490 --> 11:07.492
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.
THANK YOU.

11:10.626 --> 11:12.715
I'M GUESSING IT'S IMPORTANT.

11:12.759 --> 11:14.586
DID YOU KNOW THAT
VERONICA SKINNER
IS THE PERSON

11:14.630 --> 11:16.153
RESPONSIBLE FOR
LEAKING MY MUGSHOT?

11:16.197 --> 11:18.373
THAT'S TROUBLING.
IF IT'S TRUE.

11:18.416 --> 11:19.983
-IF?
-WHAT I MEANT IS

11:20.027 --> 11:21.855
VERONICA IS
A DEDICATED PHILANTHROPIST

11:21.898 --> 11:23.465
AND AN IMPORTANT PART
OF THIS INSTITUTION.

11:23.508 --> 11:25.206
I CAN'T IMAGINE SHE'D
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

11:25.249 --> 11:27.338
SHE PAID A STUDENT
TO POST IT.

11:27.382 --> 11:29.340
PLEASE TELL ME YOU'RE
GOING TO TAKE ACTION.

11:29.384 --> 11:31.168
OF COURSE.
I'LL HANDLE IT.

11:31.212 --> 11:33.170
SAVE THE IMPASSIONED
SPEECH, AMARA.

11:33.214 --> 11:36.173
I'LL TALK TO VERONICA.
YOU JUST FOCUS ON

11:36.217 --> 11:37.784
MAKING THIS LAST SEMESTER
A GOOD ONE.

11:43.093 --> 11:44.486
READY?

11:51.101 --> 11:53.538
GOOD SHOT, MYA.
BEND YOUR KNEES.

11:57.325 --> 12:01.764
-NO. NO, NO!
-WHAT HAPPENED?

12:01.808 --> 12:03.200
LOOK, IT'S ALL GOOD.
YOU CAN JUST

12:03.244 --> 12:04.767
USE MY RACQUET AND WE'LL
RESTRING IT LATER.

12:04.811 --> 12:08.510
NO, I--I CAN'T.
IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER.

12:08.553 --> 12:11.382
IT'S--IT'S ALL SO STUPID.

12:11.426 --> 12:15.343
MYA! LOOK,
YOU'RE PLAYING GREAT.

12:15.386 --> 12:18.085
DON'T LET SOME
BROKEN RACQUET RATTLE YOU.

12:18.128 --> 12:20.914
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
IT COSTS TO RESTRING
A RACQUET?

12:20.957 --> 12:22.611
OR HOW MUCH IT COSTS
TO GET A NEW RACQUET,

12:22.654 --> 12:24.134
WHICH IS WHAT
I REALLY NEED,

12:24.178 --> 12:26.180
SINCE I'M STILL
USING A YOUTH RACQUET.

12:26.223 --> 12:27.659
I DO, BUT
RIGHT NOW WE...

12:27.703 --> 12:29.226
LOOK, I BET
WHERE YOU'RE FROM,

12:29.270 --> 12:31.489
EVERYONE GETS NEW GEAR
AND COURT TIME

12:31.533 --> 12:34.754
WHENEVER THEY WANT
AND IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

12:34.797 --> 12:36.930
THIS IS WHY I HATE
COMING HERE.

12:38.670 --> 12:42.239
IT'S JUST A REMINDER
THAT I--

12:42.283 --> 12:44.589
I CAN'T AFFORD TO
COMPETE AT THIS LEVEL.

12:51.727 --> 12:52.772
DO YOU MIND?

13:01.868 --> 13:03.043
HOW FAR DID HE GET?

13:04.914 --> 13:06.481
KEVIN? HOW FAR...

13:09.179 --> 13:10.790
UM, HE DIDN'T.

13:12.443 --> 13:14.750
DAMON STOPPED HIM.

13:14.794 --> 13:15.795
YOU'RE LUCKY.

13:17.187 --> 13:18.493
KEVIN AND I
BECAME FRIENDS

13:18.536 --> 13:20.930
DURING FRESHMAN ORIENTATION.

13:20.974 --> 13:24.368
PURELY PLATONIC.
HE KNEW I HAD A BOYFRIEND.

13:24.412 --> 13:27.502
UM...THERE WAS
A PARTY AT PKZ

13:27.545 --> 13:29.112
AND J.R. WAS
OUT OF TOWN,

13:29.156 --> 13:31.071
SO, I INVITED KEVIN.

13:31.114 --> 13:33.595
ONE DRINK
TURNED INTO TWO.

13:33.638 --> 13:34.857
AND THE NEXT THING
I KNOW, I'M WAKING UP

13:34.901 --> 13:38.252
IN KEVIN'S ROOM
WITH NO CLOTHES

13:38.295 --> 13:40.036
AND NO MEMORY
OF WHAT HAPPENED.

13:41.342 --> 13:43.213
WELL, WHAT DID
KEVIN SAY?

13:45.302 --> 13:46.477
THAT HE HAD FUN.

13:48.349 --> 13:50.264
I FELT SO STUPID.

13:50.307 --> 13:53.267
IT WASN'T LIKE KEVIN
MADE ME DRINK.

13:53.310 --> 13:54.659
I THOUGHT I COULD
FORGET ABOUT IT, BUT

13:54.703 --> 13:58.185
THE RUMORS FLEW AND...
J.R. DUMPED ME,

13:58.228 --> 13:59.926
THINKING I CHEATED
ON HIM.

14:01.014 --> 14:04.844
AS TIME WENT BY AND MY
MEMORIES CAME BACK...

14:07.281 --> 14:09.849
I REMEMBERED KEVIN
DIDN'T DRINK.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.373
SAID HE WAS PLAYING BALL
THE NEXT DAY

14:12.416 --> 14:14.027
AND NEEDED TO BE
CLEAR-HEADED.

14:16.203 --> 14:18.161
HE KNEW EXACTLY
WHAT HE WAS DOING.

14:22.252 --> 14:25.821
DID YOU--DID YOU
TELL ANYONE?

14:29.564 --> 14:31.740
BY THE TIME I STOPPED
BLAMING MYSELF,

14:31.783 --> 14:34.003
TOO MUCH TIME
HAD PASSED, SO...

14:37.528 --> 14:39.443
I'M JUST HAPPY YOU'RE OK.

14:45.841 --> 14:49.889
YEAH, I'M OK,
NO THANKS TO YOU.

15:02.510 --> 15:03.554
SOCIAL MEDIA IS A GREAT TOOL

15:03.598 --> 15:05.078
FOR JOURNALISTS, BUT

15:05.121 --> 15:07.776
WE MUST MAINTAIN
AN OBJECTIVE TONE.

15:07.819 --> 15:11.823
OTHERWISE, WE'RE BOUND TO STEP
INTO SITUATIONS WHERE--

15:14.522 --> 15:17.960
OUR MORALS ARE QUESTIONED.

15:18.004 --> 15:21.311
BUT AS JOURNALISTS,
OUR REPUTATION

15:21.355 --> 15:22.922
IS OUR GREATEST ASSET,

15:22.965 --> 15:25.881
AND THAT IS SOMETHING
WORTH FIGHTING FOR.

15:27.230 --> 15:28.405
SEE YOU ALL NEXT WEEK.

15:34.455 --> 15:38.459
WHAT A WONDERFUL LECTURE
ON ETHICS AND RESPONSIBILITY.

15:38.502 --> 15:39.939
YOU COULD LEARN
A THING OR TWO.

15:39.982 --> 15:42.942
I HEARD PLENTY FROM ZEKE.
GOT A STERN WARNING.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.334
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

15:44.378 --> 15:45.640
I DIDN'T INTERVENE
WHEN YOU WERE

15:45.683 --> 15:46.989
CORRUPTING MY SISTER JADA

15:47.033 --> 15:48.773
WITH YOUR
DO-GOODER NONSENSE,

15:48.817 --> 15:51.472
BUT I AM TIRED OF YOU
AND YOUR MILITANT ANTICS.

15:51.515 --> 15:52.908
WHO THE HELL
DO YOU THINK YOU ARE?

15:54.040 --> 15:55.476
TINA,

15:55.519 --> 15:59.175
THANK YOU, BUT
I'VE GOT THIS.

15:59.219 --> 16:00.481
LOOK, I AM SORRY

16:00.524 --> 16:02.787
THAT YOU CAN'T LET GO
OF THE PAST,

16:02.831 --> 16:04.485
BUT I'M LEAVING BRINGSTON,

16:04.528 --> 16:05.660
SO, YOU NEED TO FIND
ANOTHER TARGET

16:05.703 --> 16:07.096
FOR YOUR LITTLE
JUVENILE GAMES.

16:07.140 --> 16:09.403
I'M NOT DONE.
NOT UNTIL I SEE YOU

16:09.446 --> 16:10.882
CRIPPLED WITH DEPRESSION

16:10.926 --> 16:13.407
AND STRUGGLE TO FIND WORK
LIKE MY SISTER DID.

16:13.450 --> 16:15.409
NO. YOU ARE DONE.

16:15.452 --> 16:19.282
AMARA DOESN'T PLAY DIRTY,
BUT I DO.

16:19.326 --> 16:22.329
YOU NEED TO THINK REAL HARD
ABOUT YOUR NEXT MOVE.

16:26.420 --> 16:29.466
ENJOY YOUR
LAST SEMESTER,

16:29.510 --> 16:32.513
BECAUSE BIG CHANGES
ARE COMING

16:32.556 --> 16:34.602
TO YOUR
BELOVED UNIVERSITY.

16:40.521 --> 16:43.306
WHAT IS SHE TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT CHANGES?

16:43.350 --> 16:45.091
I HAVE NO IDEA.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.094
TOO BAD YOU'RE
DROPPING IT.

16:50.226 --> 16:54.535
I WAS.
TILL VERONICA CAME
TO MY CLASSROOM

16:54.578 --> 16:55.884
AND SHOWED HER ASS.

16:55.927 --> 16:58.800
IF VERONICA SKINNER
WANTS A FIGHT,

16:58.843 --> 17:00.889
I'M GOING TO
GIVE HER ONE.

17:00.932 --> 17:02.673
5, 6, 7, 8.

17:10.899 --> 17:15.556
J.
YO, J.
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

17:15.599 --> 17:17.123
YEAH. Y'ALL FINISH UP,
AL RIGHT?

17:17.166 --> 17:19.081
YOU GOT 'EM?
APPRECIATE YOU.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.909
WHAT'S UP, BRO?

17:20.952 --> 17:22.432
DID YOU NOT GET
MY VOICEMAILS, BRO?

17:22.476 --> 17:23.694
NO. I BEEN HERE ALL DAY.

17:23.738 --> 17:25.827
HAVE YOU TALKED
TO YOUR MOM?

17:25.870 --> 17:27.872
NOT SINCE EARLIER, BUT
CLEARLY, SOMETHING WENT ON.

17:27.916 --> 17:30.701
-WHAT MAKES YOU SAY THAT?
-BECAUSE
YOU'RE ACTING WEIRD.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.312
AND SHE CANCELLED
DINNER ON US.

17:32.355 --> 17:33.835
SHE'D BEEN LOOKING FORWARD
TO IT ALL WEEK.

17:33.878 --> 17:35.445
ALL I DID WAS ASK HER
ABOUT MY DAD AND THEN

17:35.489 --> 17:37.230
SHE JUST STARTED ACTING WEIRD
AND GOT UP AND LEFT.

17:37.273 --> 17:38.666
SHE PROBABLY DON'T
KNOW HIM, BRO.

17:38.709 --> 17:40.624
OK, THEN WHY WOULDN'T
SHE JUST SAY THAT?

17:42.148 --> 17:43.714
I COULDN'T TELL YOU.

17:43.758 --> 17:45.586
LOOK, CAN YOU--
CAN YOU JUST

17:45.629 --> 17:48.806
TALK TO HER FOR ME,
PLEASE? PLEASE.

17:48.850 --> 17:51.983
LISTEN, MY MOTHER'S
FINALLY IN A GOOD PLACE

17:52.027 --> 17:54.116
AND I DON'T WANT
TO MESS THAT UP.

17:54.160 --> 17:56.379
ALL RIGHT?
WE TOOK THE DNA TEST.

17:56.423 --> 17:58.425
IT SAID WE NOT BROTHERS.

17:58.468 --> 18:00.427
SO, MAYBE WE SHOULD
JUST PUT IT TO THE SIDE

18:00.470 --> 18:01.906
AND FOCUS ON THE FUTURE.

18:01.950 --> 18:03.560
HOLD ON.
LET ME GET
SOMETHING STRAIGHT.

18:03.604 --> 18:05.084
SO, YOU GET THE ANSWERS
THAT YOU NEED

18:05.127 --> 18:06.694
AND JUST--AND JUST
SCREW WHAT I NEED, RIGHT?

18:06.737 --> 18:07.999
YOU KNOW DAMN WELL
THAT AIN'T WHAT I SAID.

18:08.043 --> 18:09.610
BRO, ALL YOU DO
IS CARE ABOUT YOU.

18:09.653 --> 18:10.654
YOU RUN AWAY LIKE
A LITTLE PUNK

18:10.698 --> 18:11.655
INSTEAD OF STOPPING
AND HAVING

18:11.699 --> 18:13.309
THE TOUGH CONVERSATION.

18:13.353 --> 18:15.006
THAT'S WHAT YOU DID
WITH THE BASEBALL TEAM

18:15.050 --> 18:16.791
AND THAT'S WHAT YOU DID
WITH YOUR EX, TOO, ISN'T IT?

18:16.834 --> 18:20.838
OH. SO, WE ANALYZING
EACH OTHER NOW.

18:20.882 --> 18:22.405
'CAUSE YOU PUTTING THIS
ADOPTION OBSESSION

18:22.449 --> 18:24.973
OVER EVERYTHING AND IT'S
COST YOU SIMONE ALREADY.

18:25.016 --> 18:27.236
WHOA. SIMONE HAS
NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

18:27.280 --> 18:28.672
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

18:28.716 --> 18:30.631
'CAUSE YOU DRUG HER
ALL THE WAY TO CHICAGO

18:30.674 --> 18:32.459
TO HELP YOU GET ANSWERS

18:32.502 --> 18:34.025
AND NOW SHE
BLOCKING YOU OUT.

18:34.069 --> 18:36.724
SAY, BRUH, I GET
THAT YOU GOTTA DO YOU,

18:36.767 --> 18:38.900
BUT LEAVE ME AND MY MOM
OUT OF IT, ALL RIGHT?

18:42.077 --> 18:44.384
ALL RIGHT, FELLAS,
Y'ALL LOOK GOOD.
YOU READY?

18:44.427 --> 18:46.473
1, 2, 3, 4.

18:55.743 --> 18:58.049
HEY, KEISH, YOU SEE
A LITTLE, SKINNY KID

18:58.093 --> 18:59.573
WITH A BLUE STREAK
IN HIS HAIR?

18:59.616 --> 19:00.791
-ROLAND?
-YEAH.

19:00.835 --> 19:02.271
NO, I HAVEN'T.

19:02.315 --> 19:04.273
PLEASE TELL ME
YOU HAVEN'T LOST HIM.

19:04.317 --> 19:05.405
DEFINE LOST.

19:06.971 --> 19:08.843
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
HEAR MY SPEECH

19:08.886 --> 19:10.410
ABOUT KEEPING TRACK
OF YOUR MENTEES?

19:10.453 --> 19:11.541
I KNOW, BUT
I TURNED MY BACK

19:11.585 --> 19:12.716
FOR, LIKE,
ONE SECOND, BRO.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.631
WHY ARE YOU
SO IRRESPONSIBLE?

19:14.675 --> 19:15.850
NOW WE HAVE TO
CALL SECURITY

19:15.893 --> 19:17.068
AND NOTIFY HIS PARENTS.

19:17.112 --> 19:19.636
WAIT, WAIT.
HE'S 15, NOT 9.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.595
HE'LL BE FINE.
WE'LL FIND HIM.

19:21.638 --> 19:23.597
DO YOU CARE ABOUT HOW
THIS MAKES ME LOOK?

19:23.640 --> 19:24.815
WAIT. WHY ARE YOU
GETTING SO UPSET?

19:24.859 --> 19:26.817
-I'M NOT UPSET.
-EXCUSE ME.

19:26.861 --> 19:28.776
I SAW A YOUNG BOY
WITH A BLUE STREAK

19:28.819 --> 19:30.473
TALKING TO A COUPLE
OF SORORITY GIRLS ABOUT

19:30.517 --> 19:33.084
HOW HE'S BRINGSTON'S
NEW STARTING QUARTERBACK.

19:33.128 --> 19:34.521
-PERHAPS HE'S YOURS?
-YES.

19:34.564 --> 19:35.783
THANK YOU, SIR.

19:37.567 --> 19:40.396
THANKS, DAD.
CRISIS AVERTED.

19:41.571 --> 19:42.703
YOU GUYS BREAK UP?

19:42.746 --> 19:45.880
ME AND CAM?
WE'RE NOT TOGETHER.

19:45.923 --> 19:48.099
THAT WAS THE YOUNG BOY
YOU WERE KISSING

19:48.143 --> 19:49.753
AT THE PARTY AT
OUR HOUSE, RIGHT?

19:49.797 --> 19:52.191
AND YOU GUYS FIGHT LIKE
THERE ARE FEELINGS INVOLVED.

19:52.234 --> 19:53.583
OK, WELL,
THERE ARE NO FEELINGS

19:53.627 --> 19:54.976
AND WE WERE NEVER TOGETHER.

19:55.019 --> 19:56.325
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

19:56.369 --> 19:57.935
IS THAT WHAT YOU TOLD
YOUR THERAPIST?

20:01.156 --> 20:02.592
CONSIDER THIS

20:02.636 --> 20:05.029
A FREE
THERAPY SESSION.

20:06.683 --> 20:08.294
ONE YOU CAN'T RESCHEDULE.

20:12.428 --> 20:16.693
I NEARLY LOST YOUR MOTHER
WHEN WE STARTED DATING

20:16.737 --> 20:18.260
'CAUSE I WAS SCARED

20:18.304 --> 20:20.958
OF ANYTHING THAT EVEN LOOKED
LIKE COMMITMENT.

20:23.787 --> 20:25.528
LIKE FATHER,
LIKE DAUGHTER, I GUESS.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.623
MY THERAPIST WANTS ME TO
DIG INTO PAST RELATIONSHIPS

20:33.667 --> 20:37.801
AND ANALYZE
WHAT WENT WRONG.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.154
I'M NOT SURE
I'M READY FOR THAT.

20:44.591 --> 20:47.115
YOU DON'T GET
TO THE GOOD STUFF

20:47.158 --> 20:48.769
WITHOUT WORKING
THROUGH THE BAD.

20:57.821 --> 20:59.170
THEA, DO YOU KNOW IF
CAM IS IN HERE?

20:59.214 --> 21:00.607
HIS MENTEE
KNOWS MY MENTEE

21:00.650 --> 21:01.912
AND I KIND OF NEED
SOME INSIGHT RIGHT NOW.

21:01.956 --> 21:03.479
I HAVE NO IDEA.

21:04.828 --> 21:06.221
ARE YOU OK?

21:06.265 --> 21:09.833
YEAH. I'M JUST--
IT'S WHATEVER.

21:09.877 --> 21:11.748
I JUST NEEDED
TO TALK TO DAMON.

21:11.792 --> 21:13.576
WELL, HE'S AT
ATHLETIC STUDY HALL.

21:13.620 --> 21:14.751
I WAS HEADED
THERE NEXT.

21:20.583 --> 21:21.628
HEY, UH...

21:23.847 --> 21:24.892
WILL YOU PLEASE TELL ME
WHAT'S GOING ON?

21:24.935 --> 21:26.633
I REALLY WANT TO
BE HERE TO HELP.

21:28.809 --> 21:30.027
I'M FINE.

21:31.768 --> 21:34.075
I WAS FINE.
AT LEAST, I THOUGHT I WAS,

21:34.118 --> 21:35.772
AND THEN TODAY,
HE SAID HI.

21:35.816 --> 21:37.296
WHO SAID HI?

21:39.080 --> 21:41.212
THEA, PLEASE
HELP ME UNDERSTAND.

21:48.350 --> 21:50.744
SOMETHING HAPPENED
TO ME.

21:51.745 --> 21:53.616
WELL, ALMOST HAPPENED
TO ME BECAUSE

21:53.660 --> 21:55.357
ANOTHER GIRL
DIDN'T SPEAK UP,

21:55.401 --> 21:58.665
BUT HERE I AM AND I
HAVEN'T SPOKEN UP.

21:58.708 --> 21:59.970
WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M HERE FOR YOU.

22:00.014 --> 22:02.451
OH, YOU'RE HERE FOR ME?

22:02.495 --> 22:04.323
LIKE YOU WERE THE NIGHT OF
THE EXQUISITE EIGHT PARTY?

22:04.366 --> 22:05.715
BECAUSE YOU PROMISED
TO BE THERE

22:05.759 --> 22:07.369
FOR ME THEN, TOO, RIGHT?

22:09.066 --> 22:10.633
-THEA...
-FORGET IT.

22:10.677 --> 22:12.243
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY
I'M TALKING TO YOU.

22:24.778 --> 22:27.389
DAMON, I THINK YOU
NEED TO CALL THEA.

22:27.433 --> 22:29.696
SHE WAS LOOKING
FOR YOU AND

22:29.739 --> 22:31.219
I WAS TRYING TO HELP, BUT

22:31.262 --> 22:32.568
WHATEVER IT IS
SHE'S GOING THROUGH,

22:32.612 --> 22:33.656
I THINK I MADE IT WORSE.

22:34.831 --> 22:36.964
CAN YOU PLEASE
JUST HELP ME?

22:37.007 --> 22:39.445
ALL RIGHT.
I'LL GIVE HER A CALL.

22:45.364 --> 22:46.800
HEY. IT'S DAMON.

22:46.843 --> 22:49.890
I WAS JUST CALLING
TO CHECK ON YOU.
HIT ME BACK, OK?

22:49.933 --> 22:51.457
HEY, SIMONE,
I HEARD YOUR LITTLE

22:51.500 --> 22:53.633
VOLUNTEERING SESSION
WAS A DISASTER.

22:53.676 --> 22:55.504
-EXCUSE ME?
-WELL, MY MENTEE

22:55.548 --> 22:57.898
IS FRIENDS WITH YOUR MENTEE,
SO, YOU KNOW.

22:57.941 --> 23:00.944
YEAH. IT WASN'T
GREAT, BUT

23:00.988 --> 23:03.077
MYA'S SUPER TALENTED
BUT SHE CAN'T AFFORD

23:03.120 --> 23:04.644
EQUIPMENT OR
COURT TIME.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.037
I DID THE MATH
AND MY PARENTS SPENT

23:07.081 --> 23:08.691
AT LEAST 15,000,
AND THAT

23:08.735 --> 23:10.171
DOESN'T EVEN
INCLUDE TOURNAMENTS.

23:10.214 --> 23:11.302
TELL ME ABOUT IT.
MY MOM

23:11.346 --> 23:12.782
SPENT, LIKE, 3 TIMES THAT.

23:12.826 --> 23:14.175
THAT AIN'T NOTHING NEW.

23:14.218 --> 23:15.829
BLACK KIDS BEEN
PRICED OUT OF Y'ALL'S

23:15.872 --> 23:17.483
BOUGIE SPORTS FOR DECADES.

23:17.526 --> 23:18.832
WELL, WE GOTTA FIX THIS.

23:18.875 --> 23:20.529
AT LEAST FOR
OUR MENTEES.

23:20.573 --> 23:22.923
FIGURE OUT A WAY
TO HELP THEM LONG TERM.

23:22.966 --> 23:23.924
WE'LL BRAINSTORM.

23:23.967 --> 23:25.055
GET A GROUP TOGETHER,

23:25.099 --> 23:26.927
HAVE A FAMILY-ISH DINNER
AT MY AUNT'S.

23:26.970 --> 23:28.058
WE COULD ORDER PIZZA.

23:28.102 --> 23:30.583
I'M ALWAYS DOWN
FOR FREE FOOD.

23:30.626 --> 23:32.193
AND A GOOD CAUSE.

23:32.236 --> 23:33.934
YOU KNOW, THE KIDS.

23:35.065 --> 23:36.632
LOOK, IF WE WANT TO MAKE
A REAL IMPACT

23:36.676 --> 23:37.938
IN THESE KIDS' LIVES,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO

23:37.981 --> 23:39.461
MAKE A LONG-TERM COMMITMENT.

23:39.505 --> 23:41.158
WHAT ABOUT GRANTS?
I MEAN, I'M SURE

23:41.202 --> 23:42.638
THERE'S TONS OF PEOPLE
THAT WE CAN WRITE TO.

23:42.682 --> 23:44.161
IT TAKES FOREVER
TO GET THOSE GRANTS.

23:44.205 --> 23:45.511
THEM KIDS WILL
GRADUATE COLLEGE

23:45.554 --> 23:46.947
BEFORE THEY EVER
SAW A PENNY.

23:46.990 --> 23:48.165
I MIGHT BE
ABLE TO HELP.

23:48.209 --> 23:50.733
MY FIRM WORKS WITH
AN ORGANIZATION IN L.A.

23:50.777 --> 23:51.734
THAT PROVIDES
RESOURCES FOR

23:51.778 --> 23:52.953
MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL
ATHLETES.

23:52.996 --> 23:54.607
I'VE GOT THE CEO
ON SPEED DIAL.

23:54.650 --> 23:56.826
I COULD GIVE HER A CALL.
MAYBE SHE COULD

23:56.870 --> 23:58.088
GIVE YOU SOME ADVICE.

24:00.090 --> 24:04.486
I THINK WE'D LOVE THAT.

24:06.793 --> 24:07.881
AUNTIE JUST TEXTED.

24:07.924 --> 24:08.882
SAID SHE'S WORKING LATE,

24:08.925 --> 24:10.753
SO, NOT TO WAIT UP.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.712
I HOPE AMARA
COMES TO HER SENSES

24:12.755 --> 24:14.104
AND STAYS AT BRINGSTON.

24:14.148 --> 24:16.759
I DO, TOO, BUT THIS
FAMILY IS VERY STUBBORN.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.458
IT TAKES A LOT FOR THEM
TO CHANGE THEIR MINDS.

24:19.501 --> 24:20.546
TRUE, WHICH IS WHY

24:20.589 --> 24:22.504
I'M ASKING YOU AGAIN--

24:22.548 --> 24:23.549
WHAT'S WRONG?

24:23.592 --> 24:25.289
DON'T SAY "NOTHING"
AND DO NOT THINK

24:25.333 --> 24:26.769
I AM LEAVING TOWN
WITHOUT AN ANSWER.

24:26.813 --> 24:28.162
OK.

24:29.555 --> 24:30.599
OK.

24:32.558 --> 24:34.821
I JUST FEEL LIKE
EVERYTHING'S MESSED UP
RIGHT NOW.

24:34.864 --> 24:37.737
I LET MY TEAMMATE
THEA DOWN, LIKE, BIG TIME.

24:38.868 --> 24:40.435
I HAD TO END MY FRIENDSHIP
WITH DAMON.

24:40.479 --> 24:41.697
YOU MEAN THE YOUNG MAN
THAT WAS

24:41.741 --> 24:42.829
EYEING YOU ALL NIGHT?

24:42.872 --> 24:43.960
I CAN'T BE
FRIENDS WITH HIM

24:44.004 --> 24:46.049
AND BE WITH
JORDAN, MOM.

24:46.093 --> 24:48.356
AND JORDAN IS
3,000 MILES AWAY

24:48.399 --> 24:50.184
AND I WANT TO
BLAME IT ON DISTANCE,

24:50.227 --> 24:53.317
BUT THINGS JUST--
JUST FEELS OFF.

24:53.361 --> 24:55.363
AND I DON'T WANT
ANYBODY TO GET HURT.

24:55.406 --> 24:58.584
RELATIONSHIPS ARE
COMPLICATED, HONEY,

24:58.627 --> 25:02.326
BOTH ROMANTIC
AND NON-ROMANTIC ONES.

25:04.285 --> 25:08.419
WHAT YOU NEED IS A RESET.
COME HOME FOR FALL BREAK.

25:08.463 --> 25:10.465
YOU COULD SEE JORDAN
AND VISIT HIM

25:10.509 --> 25:11.945
AT GOLDEN ANGELES.

25:11.988 --> 25:14.251
TRUE. BUT I CAN'T
AFFORD IT.

25:14.295 --> 25:16.732
-I'LL BUY YOUR TICKET.
-MOM, I DON'T--

25:19.082 --> 25:20.214
THE TIME ISN'T RIGHT.

25:20.257 --> 25:23.217
OK. I'M GOING TO
STOP PUSHING

25:23.260 --> 25:24.827
BECAUSE YOU'RE
JUST GONNA KEEP

25:24.871 --> 25:26.742
COMING UP WITH
EXCUSES, SO.

25:32.966 --> 25:35.011
HMM. IT'S MY CLIENT.

25:35.055 --> 25:36.665
APPARENTLY, THE PROGRAM
IN L.A.

25:36.709 --> 25:38.885
HAS OPENED TWO ADDITIONAL
SATELLITE OFFICES.

25:38.928 --> 25:41.365
ONE IS HERE IN ATLANTA.

25:41.409 --> 25:42.932
THE DIRECTOR AGREED
TO HEAR YOU OUT

25:42.976 --> 25:44.412
ON WHY THEY SHOULD
BRING THEIR RESOURCES

25:44.455 --> 25:46.240
TO BRINGSTON...
TOMORROW MORNING.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.851
-MOM, THAT'S AMAZING.
-I KNOW IT'S FAST.

25:48.895 --> 25:50.374
NO, NO, THAT'S GREAT.

25:52.072 --> 25:53.377
WE'LL BE READY.

25:55.336 --> 25:56.990
OUR MISSION IS
TO CREATE CHAMPIONS

25:57.033 --> 25:58.687
ON AND OFF THE COURT.

25:58.731 --> 25:59.906
YEAH, THAT'S--THAT'S
WHAT WE STAND FOR

25:59.949 --> 26:01.516
HERE AT BRINGSTON, TOO.

26:01.560 --> 26:04.084
BRINGSTON ATHLETICS HAS
MENTORED KIDS FOR YEARS,

26:04.127 --> 26:06.260
BUT ONE WEEKEND A YEAR
IS ALL THEY GET.

26:06.303 --> 26:08.436
SO, THIS IS A CHANCE
FOR YOUR ORGANIZATION

26:08.479 --> 26:10.090
TO HELP TRAIN
FUTURE ATHLETES

26:10.133 --> 26:12.440
AND HBCU GRADS.

26:12.483 --> 26:14.050
AN OPPORTUNITY
TO DO SOMETHING

26:14.094 --> 26:16.183
FOR THE CULTURE
AND FOR SPORTS.

26:20.230 --> 26:22.624
I'VE ALSO RECEIVED
COMMITMENTS FROM

26:22.668 --> 26:24.321
BRINGSTON'S
FOOTBALL, BASEBALL,

26:24.365 --> 26:25.671
AND TENNIS COACHES,

26:25.714 --> 26:27.411
AS WELL AS
DOZENS OF ATHLETES,

26:27.455 --> 26:30.066
THAT THEY'LL DONATE
5 HOURS A MONTH EACH

26:30.110 --> 26:32.678
TO COACH THE KIDS
WHO HAVE ENROLLED.

26:32.721 --> 26:36.943
OK. IF YOU CAN SIGN UP
25 HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETES,

26:36.986 --> 26:38.379
WE'D LOVE
TO WELCOME BRINGSTON

26:38.422 --> 26:40.729
TO THE STELLAR
AMBITIONS FAMILY.

26:40.773 --> 26:42.775
ABSOLUTELY.
WE'RE ON IT.

26:42.818 --> 26:44.428
YEAH, YEAH.
THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR YOUR TIME.

26:44.472 --> 26:45.908
IT'S SO NICE
TO MEET YOU.

26:45.952 --> 26:47.431
-THANK YOU.
-THANK YOU.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.786
DAMON SIMS,
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

26:53.829 --> 26:56.136

26:58.965 --> 27:00.227
AND YET YOU STAY
SO HUMBLE.

27:00.270 --> 27:02.882
NAH,
I REALLY, I JUST--

27:02.925 --> 27:03.970
I NEEDED
SOMETHING POSITIVE

27:04.013 --> 27:06.276
TO FOCUS ON LAST NIGHT.

27:06.320 --> 27:09.671
RIGHT NOW IN MY LIFE,
EVERYTHING IS JUST SO...

27:13.719 --> 27:15.808
I GOTTA GET TO
MYA'S MATCH.

27:15.851 --> 27:17.636
UM, BUT I CAN WORK ON

27:17.679 --> 27:20.334
SIGNING UP PEOPLE FOR
THE TENNIS PROGRAM.

27:20.377 --> 27:21.944
THINK YOU AND CAM
CAN FOCUS ON

27:21.988 --> 27:23.598
FOOTBALL AND BASEBALL?

27:23.642 --> 27:25.426
YEAH, YEAH.

28:09.470 --> 28:11.254

CAN I TALK TO YOU?

28:11.298 --> 28:13.213
I CAN'T.
I HAVE REHEARSAL.

28:13.256 --> 28:14.736
LOOK, I OWE YOU
AN APOLOGY.

28:16.564 --> 28:20.220
I...I SPENT ALL MORNING
AT THE TENNIS COURTS

28:20.263 --> 28:22.657
WATCHING THESE
YOUNG GIRLS PRACTICING

28:22.701 --> 28:24.964
AND I JUST KEPT
THINKING ABOUT HOW

28:25.007 --> 28:26.443
THEY'RE JUST LIKE US,

28:26.487 --> 28:28.097
DREAMING OF COMING
TO BRINGSTON,

28:28.141 --> 28:31.100
EXCITED ABOUT MAYBE
PLEDGING A SORORITY

28:31.144 --> 28:32.623
OR GOING ON A DATE
WITH A CUTE GUY,

28:32.667 --> 28:36.236
AND WHAT WOULD
HAPPEN TO THEM

28:36.279 --> 28:39.152
IF THEY ENCOUNTERED
A GUY LIKE KEVIN.

28:39.195 --> 28:41.763
HE WON'T STOP UNLESS
SOMEONE STOPS HIM.

28:41.807 --> 28:44.723
WHICH IS WHY I
MADE AN APPOINTMENT

28:44.766 --> 28:48.988
WITH THE DEAN OF STUDENTS
AND PRESIDENT ALLEN.

28:49.031 --> 28:50.119
AND IF YOU WENT WITH ME,

28:50.163 --> 28:51.599
WE'D REALLY HAVE A CASE.

28:54.297 --> 28:57.779
I ADMIRE YOUR OPTIMISM,
BUT GIRLS IN THESE

28:57.823 --> 29:01.217
"HE SAID/SHE SAID"
SITUATIONS ALWAYS LOSE.

29:02.479 --> 29:04.133
I'M NOT WRECKING
MY LIFE SO KEVIN

29:04.177 --> 29:05.178
CAN GET A SLAP
ON THE WRIST.

29:05.221 --> 29:07.441
AQUEELAH, I'LL BE
BY YOUR SIDE.

29:07.484 --> 29:09.922
I'M SORRY.
I CAN'T.

29:09.965 --> 29:11.445
4:00 TOMORROW.

29:12.446 --> 29:14.230
PRESIDENT ALLEN'S OFFICE.

29:14.274 --> 29:15.536
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

29:16.842 --> 29:20.410
AND I HOPE ONE DAY
YOU CAN SPEAK YOUR TRUTH.

29:21.542 --> 29:23.109
FOR YOUR OWN HEALING.

29:38.167 --> 29:39.299
OH, JEEZ.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.133
I HOPE YOU FIND IT.

29:47.176 --> 29:49.091
-FIND WHAT?
-WHATEVER YOU'RE
MANICALLY LOOKING FOR.

29:49.135 --> 29:51.615
NOBODY'S MANIC, AMARA.

29:51.659 --> 29:53.443
IT'S JUST A TURN
OF PHRASE, MARCUS.

29:53.487 --> 29:56.316
OK, LOOK, I'M SORRY.
I'M JUST FRUSTRATED.

29:56.359 --> 29:57.360
YOU OK?

29:57.404 --> 29:59.449
YEAH. JUST DOING
A LITTLE DIGGING

29:59.493 --> 30:02.409
FOR A STORY,
AND PERSONAL REASONS,

30:02.452 --> 30:03.845
AND STUMBLED ON SOMETHING.

30:03.889 --> 30:06.239
YOU KNOW THAT NEW
BOARD MEMBER VERONICA?

30:06.282 --> 30:08.502
YEAH. THE HEFFA THAT
POSTED YOUR MUGSHOT.

30:08.545 --> 30:10.504
DID YOU KNOW ZEKE
PERSONALLY RECRUITED HER

30:10.547 --> 30:12.114
ONTO BRINGSTON'S BOARD?

30:12.158 --> 30:14.247
TURNS OUT SHE WAS AN ASSOCIATE
OF HIS LATE WIFE'S.

30:14.290 --> 30:16.423
THEY SERVED ON PHILANTHROPIC
BOARDS TOGETHER.

30:16.466 --> 30:18.164
OK, SO, ZEKE
HAS POOR TASTE.

30:18.207 --> 30:20.166
OH, THERE'S MORE.

30:20.209 --> 30:22.690
I GOT A LIST OF BRINGSTON'S
FINANCIAL DONORS,

30:22.733 --> 30:24.431
AND VERONICA
ISN'T ONE OF THEM.

30:24.474 --> 30:26.215
WAIT A MINUTE.
IF SHE'S NOT DONATING

30:26.259 --> 30:27.434
MONEY TO BRINGSTON...

30:28.827 --> 30:31.699
WHY IS SHE SO VALUABLE
TO ZEKE AND THIS COLLEGE?

30:31.742 --> 30:34.136
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT
I NEED TO FIND OUT.

30:38.010 --> 30:40.360
-HEY, MA.
-UM, I HOPE
YOU DON'T MIND.

30:40.403 --> 30:41.840
ONE OF YOUR FRAT BROTHERS
LET ME IN.

30:41.883 --> 30:42.928
OF COURSE NOT.

30:42.971 --> 30:44.364
I WAS ACTUALLY GONNA
REACH OUT TO YOU.

30:44.407 --> 30:45.626
MAKE SURE YOU WERE OK.

30:45.669 --> 30:46.975
-J.R.--
-I'M SORRY ABOUT

30:47.019 --> 30:48.368
THE WHOLE DAMON
AMBUSH THING.

30:48.411 --> 30:50.065
I WAS JUST TRYING TO
HELP OUT A FRIEND.

30:50.109 --> 30:51.240
BUT IF THAT COME AT
THE COST OF YOUR

30:51.284 --> 30:52.938
PEACE OF MIND, NO,

30:52.981 --> 30:55.679
ESPECIALLY WHEN THAT
FRIEND IS UNGRATEFUL.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.290
YOU AND DAMON HAVE
A FALLING OUT?

30:57.333 --> 30:59.379
YEAH. 'CAUSE HE THINK
I'M SOME WEAK FOOL

30:59.422 --> 31:01.555
THAT RUNS AT THE FIRST
SIGN OF CONFLICT.

31:08.040 --> 31:10.999
I THINK MAYBE IT'S TIME
WE BOTH STOP RUNNING.

31:11.043 --> 31:12.653
MOM, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

31:14.002 --> 31:15.134
HAVE A SEAT, SON.

31:18.180 --> 31:19.878
WE NEED TO TALK.

31:25.622 --> 31:26.667
MYA.

31:28.712 --> 31:30.062
I GOT SOME
BIG NEWS.

31:31.541 --> 31:33.413
A WAY TO MAKE SURE
YOU CAN AFFORD

31:33.456 --> 31:35.415
TO COMPETE
AT THIS LEVEL.

31:35.458 --> 31:37.069
I'M NOT INTERESTED
IN CHARITY.

31:37.112 --> 31:38.287
NO. IT'S NOT CHARITY.

31:38.331 --> 31:40.333
I KNOW HOW
THIS WORKS, OK?

31:40.376 --> 31:42.770
I GET EXCITED AND THEN
FUNDING GETS CUT,

31:42.813 --> 31:44.206
OR WHOEVER RUNS
THIS PROGRAM

31:44.250 --> 31:46.078
FINDS A NEW PROJECT.

31:46.121 --> 31:47.340
CAN I FINISH WARMING UP?

31:57.654 --> 31:59.308
LISA, YO, I JUST
NEED TWO MINUTES,

31:59.352 --> 32:01.484
AND DON'T THINK THAT
I WON'T SING BEYONCE

32:01.528 --> 32:03.660
AT THE TOP OF MY LUNGS
TO GET YOU TO LISTEN.

32:03.704 --> 32:05.314
I WISH YOU'D BROUGHT
THIS TYPE OF ENERGY

32:05.358 --> 32:06.576
WHEN WE WERE DATING.

32:13.279 --> 32:16.238
I JUST...I JUST
WANTED TO SAY THAT

32:16.282 --> 32:18.632
I KNOW THAT I...

32:18.675 --> 32:20.503
KINDA SUCKED
AS A GIRLFRIEND.

32:20.547 --> 32:22.766
KINDA? THE MOMENT
THINGS BETWEEN US

32:22.810 --> 32:25.334
GOT TOO REAL,
YOU SABOTAGED IT.

32:25.378 --> 32:28.468
I MEAN, I--I THINK
THAT'S A LITTLE STRONG.
I DIDN'T...

32:28.511 --> 32:29.817
STAND ME UP?

32:31.036 --> 32:32.254
GASLIGHT ME INTO
THINKING WE WERE

32:32.298 --> 32:34.039
LESS SERIOUS
THAN WE WERE?

32:34.082 --> 32:35.779
MY THERAPIST TOLD ME
THAT TALKING TO YOU

32:35.823 --> 32:39.522
WOULD BE GOOD FOR ME
BUT THIS FEELS...AWFUL.

32:39.566 --> 32:41.785
WAIT. YOU ACTUALLY
WENT TO THERAPY?

32:41.829 --> 32:42.873
I DID.

32:42.917 --> 32:44.440
AND NOW YOU'RE HERE
ASKING QUESTIONS

32:44.484 --> 32:47.008
EVEN THOUGH
YOU HATE CONFRONTATION.

32:47.052 --> 32:49.358
WHAT MOTIVATED THAT?

32:49.402 --> 32:50.664
OR SHOULD I ASK WHO?

32:52.883 --> 32:56.626
OH, WOW.
I GUESS IT REALLY IS A WHO.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.324
I-I THOUGHT MY
FEAR OF COMMITMENT

32:58.367 --> 33:00.369
WAS 'CAUSE I WAS AFRAID

33:00.413 --> 33:02.023
TO LOVE AND LOSE
A SOULMATE

33:02.067 --> 33:03.111
LIKE MY DAD DID.

33:04.069 --> 33:06.854
BUT I--I THINK
THAT ACTUALLY--

33:06.897 --> 33:08.551
YOU DON'T THINK
YOU'RE GOOD ENOUGH.

33:09.857 --> 33:10.989
PSYCH MAJOR.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.556
DIDN'T TAKE ME LONG
TO FIGURE THAT OUT.

33:13.600 --> 33:15.906
OK, MADAM PSYCH MAJOR...

33:17.517 --> 33:19.693
YOU GOT ANY ADVICE?

33:19.736 --> 33:22.261
NOBODY'S GONNA CONVINCE YOU
YOU'RE WORTHY OF LOVE.

33:24.002 --> 33:26.482
THAT'S ON YOU
TO FIGURE OUT.

33:26.526 --> 33:28.049
THAT SOUNDS EASY ENOUGH.

33:32.532 --> 33:35.274
THANK YOU. HONESTLY.

33:39.408 --> 33:41.758
HEY, KEISH, WHEN YOU DO

33:41.802 --> 33:44.283
LET GO OF ALL YOUR BAGGAGE
AND GO ALL IN...

33:46.067 --> 33:48.026
YOU'RE GONNA BE
ONE BADASS GIRLFRIEND.

33:55.076 --> 33:56.077
WHOO!

34:08.220 --> 34:10.570
YOU DID GREAT! MM!

34:10.613 --> 34:12.050
DID YOU SEE THAT?

34:12.093 --> 34:13.529
THE WAY I HIT
MY FOREHAND?

34:13.573 --> 34:15.444
IT WAS PERFECTION, MYA.

34:15.488 --> 34:17.620
TOO BAD YOU'RE
WASTING YOUR TALENT.

34:17.664 --> 34:19.361
MOM. DON'T.

34:19.405 --> 34:21.363
YOU'RE GOOD.
YOU KNOW THAT.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.583
BUT YOU'RE LETTING YOUR
PRIDE GET IN YOUR WAY,

34:23.626 --> 34:24.671
AND PRIDE
KEEPS YOU FROM

34:24.714 --> 34:26.325
STEPPING INTO
YOUR POWER.

34:27.891 --> 34:29.589
DO YOU REALLY THINK
I HAVE WHAT IT TAKES

34:29.632 --> 34:31.025
TO PLAY COLLEGE
TENNIS, SIMONE?

34:31.069 --> 34:35.856
YES. BUT IN ORDER
FOR YOU TO COMPETE,

34:35.899 --> 34:38.293
YOU NEED
COACHING, EQUIPMENT,

34:38.337 --> 34:41.427
AND LOTS OF PRACTICE
TO HONE YOUR SKILLS, MYA.

34:46.171 --> 34:47.998
CAN I SEE THAT
BROCHURE AGAIN?

34:58.400 --> 34:59.401
HEY.

34:59.445 --> 35:03.623
UH, HEY.
HOW'D THE MATCH GO?

35:03.666 --> 35:05.407
MYA WON AND I GOT HER

35:05.451 --> 35:07.496
AND 12 OTHER
TENNIS GIRLS TO SIGN UP,

35:07.540 --> 35:09.019
SO, BETWEEN ME,
YOU, AND CAM,

35:09.063 --> 35:10.717
WE GOT 30 KIDS
TO COMMIT.

35:10.760 --> 35:12.501

-SO, STELLAR AMBITIONS

35:12.545 --> 35:14.590
IS OFFICIALLY PARTNERING

35:14.634 --> 35:15.678
THAT'S REALLY DOPE.

35:17.376 --> 35:19.987
THANK YOU, AGAIN,
FOR ALL YOUR HELP.

35:20.030 --> 35:22.511
YEAH, WELL,
WE MAKE A GOOD TEAM.

35:23.643 --> 35:25.427
YEAH.

35:25.471 --> 35:27.864

LIKE, GRAB

35:33.261 --> 35:34.567
A COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

35:34.610 --> 35:36.090

35:37.178 --> 35:40.007
ACTUALLY, I'M GONNA TAKE
MY MOM UP ON HER OFFER.

35:40.050 --> 35:42.183
I'M GONNA HEAD BACK

35:43.358 --> 35:45.186
YEAH. HEH.
OH, FOR SURE.

35:45.230 --> 35:46.883
THAT'S...THAT'S GOOD.

35:49.147 --> 35:52.019
WELL, GUESS I'LL
SEE YOU AROUND.

35:53.194 --> 35:54.195
YUP.

35:57.372 --> 35:58.721
HEY, UM...

35:59.853 --> 36:02.116
YOU EVER THINK
IT WAS A MISTAKE?

36:02.160 --> 36:04.162
YOU COMING TO
CHICAGO WITH ME?

36:04.205 --> 36:06.686
NO. NEVER.

36:06.729 --> 36:09.036
DAMON, I WANTED
TO SUPPORT YOU.

36:09.079 --> 36:11.169
I JUST KEEP
THINKING THAT

36:11.212 --> 36:12.779
MAYBE IT'D BE
EASIER ON EVERYONE

36:12.822 --> 36:13.997
IF I WOULD JUST STOP

36:14.041 --> 36:15.608
LOOKING FOR
MY BIRTH PARENTS.

36:16.565 --> 36:18.045
YOU DON'T REALLY
BELIEVE THAT.

36:25.748 --> 36:31.928
LOOK, HAVE A SAFE FLIGHT,
SIMONE HICKS.

36:54.821 --> 36:56.344
I COULDN'T SLEEP.

37:37.777 --> 37:38.865
YO, AND AGAIN, SORRY ABOUT

37:38.908 --> 37:40.606
THE MISSING STUDY HALL LOG.

37:40.649 --> 37:41.868
I'LL FIND IT.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.609
IT'S ALL GOOD, ALL RIGHT?
TAKE IT EASY.

37:50.616 --> 37:52.661
HEY.

37:52.705 --> 37:55.011
THANKS FOR ALL THE CALLS
CHECKING ON ME.

37:55.055 --> 37:57.710
SORRY I'VE BEEN M.I.A.

37:57.753 --> 37:59.973
NAH, WE STRAIGHT.
I KNOW YOU WERE

KEVIN SITUATION.

38:01.844 --> 38:03.716
-YEAH.
-GOOD FOR YOU

38:03.759 --> 38:04.847
FOR PUTTING HIM
ON BLAST, BY THE WAY.

38:04.891 --> 38:07.546
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

38:07.589 --> 38:10.200
UH, THIS WASN'T YOU?

38:11.898 --> 38:14.596
NO. BUT I KNOW
WHO IT WAS.

38:15.815 --> 38:17.338
I WENT TO
PRESIDENT ALLEN AND HE'S

38:17.382 --> 38:19.949
LAUNCHING A COMPLETE
INVESTIGATION.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.082
SO, IF THERE ARE
OTHER GIRLS,

38:22.125 --> 38:24.345
HOPEFULLY THEY'LL
COME FORWARD.

38:24.389 --> 38:25.651
YOU KNOW, YOU DID
A GOOD THING.

38:25.694 --> 38:27.348
YEAH, YOU DID, TOO.

AHH. AHH.

38:37.706 --> 38:39.839
HEY, ARE YOU OK?

38:39.882 --> 38:41.710
I ONLY WORK OUT
THAT HARD

38:41.754 --> 38:43.625
WHEN SOMETHING'S
MESSING WITH MY HEAD.

38:43.669 --> 38:46.715
UH, YEAH.
I DON'T WANNA BORE YOU.

38:46.759 --> 38:47.890
YOU WON'T.

38:48.848 --> 38:50.806
WHY DON'T WE GRAB
A BITE AND TALK?

38:52.025 --> 38:54.593
OR NOT.
WE COULD JUST

38:54.636 --> 38:55.942
SIT IN SILENCE.

38:58.597 --> 39:00.903
I KNOW YOU'VE
BEEN THROUGH,

39:00.947 --> 39:03.515

39:08.520 --> 39:10.565
OR JUST, LIKE, TWO FRIENDS
GRABBING A MEAL?

CAN IT BE BOTH?

39:16.745 --> 39:20.140

39:20.183 --> 39:22.882
JUST LET ME, UM,

WHY DON'T YOU
HANDLE THAT FIRST

39:28.801 --> 39:30.324
AND THEN COME FIND ME.

39:32.805 --> 39:34.763
YO, I'M GONNA

39:34.807 --> 39:37.331

40:17.589 --> 40:20.374
BUT...I CHANGED MY MIND.

40:20.418 --> 40:21.854
WHATEVER I NEED TO DO
