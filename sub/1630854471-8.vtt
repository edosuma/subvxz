00:03.962 --> 00:05.588
I want you to repeat after me.

00:05.880 --> 00:07.799
<i>Things are going incredibly well.</i>

00:08.008 --> 00:10.510
It is a win-win, my friend.

00:12.679 --> 00:14.180
Things are going incredibly well.

00:14.431 --> 00:20.061
<i>My company was just featured
on national television.</i>

00:20.228 --> 00:23.523
It will be ugly, Steve.
Blood will spill.

00:23.857 --> 00:27.652
<i>Everything you've worked
so hard to build will be in jeopardy.</i>

00:27.861 --> 00:29.154
Business is booming.

00:29.446 --> 00:30.739
<i>Business is booming.</i>

00:31.364 --> 00:34.117
<i>When you're the king,
there's gonna be snakes in the grass.</i>

00:34.117 --> 00:35.702
People wanna take you down.

00:35.869 --> 00:39.998
<i>I, Ray Colon, offering my everlasting
oath of loyalty.</i>

00:40.582 --> 00:43.043
<i>I live in a big,
beautiful house,</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.920
and I'm not going to blow it
on some silly little slight.

00:46.421 --> 00:49.132
I'm not going to blow it
on some silly little slight.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.138
Nick! Nick!

00:55.513 --> 00:56.973
What did you do with that money?

00:56.973 --> 00:59.100
<i>He's guilty.
Sure seems that way.</i>

00:59.100 --> 01:00.935
One problem.
There's no hard evidence.

01:00.935 --> 01:03.354
Don't worry about that. Any of that.

04:01.115 --> 04:02.200
Steve!

04:03.076 --> 04:05.995
Steve Banerjee in the house, man.

04:08.539 --> 04:10.375
It's good to see you.

04:16.214 --> 04:17.465
Oh, man, it's good to see you.

04:17.465 --> 04:18.591
Have a seat.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.218
- Good to see you.
- It's been too long.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.053
- You look good.
- You look good, too.

04:22.053 --> 04:23.263
- Yeah?
- Hello.

04:23.263 --> 04:24.347
<i>Guten abend.</i>

04:24.347 --> 04:25.431
English menu?

04:25.640 --> 04:26.683
How did you know?

04:28.434 --> 04:29.936
Thank you very much, love.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.526
I see why you wanted to meet here.
This town...

04:37.068 --> 04:41.698
It's charming. It's charming as fuck.
I feel like I'm in that movie.

04:42.865 --> 04:43.866
What movie?

04:44.450 --> 04:46.619
The one with the kids
and the British lady

04:46.619 --> 04:48.538
running around the mountain
singing and shit.

04:49.622 --> 04:52.333
Anyway, how's everything? How's life?

04:54.127 --> 04:55.378
Uh, fine.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.005
- Fine?
- Yes.

04:59.340 --> 05:01.592
Man, the things you must be seeing. Huh?

05:02.677 --> 05:04.304
- What do you mean?
- Chippendales.

05:05.054 --> 05:07.473
World tour. You been to Italy yet?

05:07.974 --> 05:11.311
Next month. Milan, Naples.
Three nights in Rome.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.645
Italy, man.

05:12.895 --> 05:16.149
I hear the ladies there
is like half a million Sophia Lorens.

05:20.653 --> 05:21.654
You okay?

05:23.948 --> 05:26.367
You keep looking around
like you're waiting for somebody.

05:26.701 --> 05:27.702
No.

05:37.003 --> 05:39.339
Where did that lady go?
The lady who gave us the menu.

05:39.339 --> 05:40.923
Shouldn't she be giving us water?

05:40.923 --> 05:42.759
- You need to chill.
- Why is a different man

05:42.759 --> 05:43.885
- giving us...
- Chill.

05:44.677 --> 05:45.678
Yeah.

05:53.936 --> 05:55.772
I think someone
is following me.

05:58.733 --> 06:00.068
- Who?
- I don't know.

06:00.401 --> 06:01.861
- You seen someone?
- Not...

06:16.250 --> 06:18.002
If you ain't see nobody follow you,

06:18.461 --> 06:20.088
how do you know somebody following you?

06:20.088 --> 06:23.007
It's just a feeling, man.
Strange things are happening.

06:23.800 --> 06:25.968
I saw the same man three times today.
Three times!

06:26.886 --> 06:29.430
In my hotel room,
the power went out for two hours.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.600
I ordered butterscotch gelato
and they gave me peach.

06:34.352 --> 06:35.520
Could be culture shock.

06:36.396 --> 06:37.605
- Culture shock?
- Yeah, man.

06:37.605 --> 06:41.150
Things are different here.
They call shampoo <i>"shampooing."</i>

06:43.444 --> 06:46.406
Ladies and gentlemen,
we are unfortunately experiencing

06:46.406 --> 06:48.324
a mechanical issue with our kitchen.

06:48.324 --> 06:51.828
If you've just arrived or ordered
and not yet received your meal,

06:51.828 --> 06:54.580
I'm afraid we will not be able
to accommodate you.

06:54.705 --> 06:55.706
Sincerest apologies.

06:57.041 --> 06:58.626
- What happened?
- I guess we gotta go.

06:58.626 --> 07:00.420
- Someone is fucking with me.
- Nobody is.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.089
Nobody shuts down a restaurant
while people are sitting there.

07:03.256 --> 07:05.341
I got a menu.
Why would they shut it down?

07:05.341 --> 07:06.426
This doesn't make sense

07:06.426 --> 07:08.386
Without power,
how they gonna cook the food?

07:08.386 --> 07:10.805
I don't like it. I have to go.
I should not have met you.

07:10.805 --> 07:12.515
Look, let's go to my hotel, man.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.559
It's right across the street.

07:14.559 --> 07:16.978
There's a mini bar.
We have some beers, right?

07:17.395 --> 07:20.398
Keep talking. You know,
total privacy, man. Just you and me.

07:21.315 --> 07:22.525
Let's keep talking, man.

07:24.193 --> 07:25.278
Be nice to catch up.

07:39.750 --> 07:40.751
Mmm.

07:41.335 --> 07:42.336
Shit.

07:42.336 --> 07:45.298
Beer in Europe is crisp, man!

07:46.382 --> 07:48.468
This whole city is crisp.

07:48.468 --> 07:50.178
Like, how they keep it so clean?

07:50.386 --> 07:54.849
You know, I'm not complaining.
I enjoy discovering new lands and shit.

07:54.974 --> 07:58.019
You know, I don't understand why
I had to <i>schlep</i> this far, but...

07:58.019 --> 08:02.356
<i>- Schlep?
- Schlep.</i> It's Yiddish or Jewish.

08:03.483 --> 08:05.443
For like, drag your ass somewhere.

08:07.612 --> 08:09.447
My sister-in-law's from Long Island.

08:18.122 --> 08:19.999
I appreciate you coming all this way.

08:21.334 --> 08:25.796
The phone lines, you know,
they're not safe.

08:27.131 --> 08:28.549
You think they tapped your phone?

08:29.383 --> 08:30.384
I can't rule it out.

08:33.888 --> 08:38.142
So I guess
the million dollar question is,

08:39.227 --> 08:40.937
you still want me to go through with it?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.650
Tell me what happened.

08:47.568 --> 08:48.694
You mean in London?

08:49.111 --> 08:50.238
Yes, in London.

08:50.238 --> 08:51.781
What happened? What went wrong?

08:51.781 --> 08:53.074
You really want to know?

08:53.449 --> 08:55.201
- I'm asking.
- Yeah, well, uh...

08:56.702 --> 08:57.787
Yeah.

09:01.624 --> 09:05.169
So, I go to the theater, right?

09:05.711 --> 09:06.921
<i>And I got everything set up.</i>

09:06.921 --> 09:11.300
I got everything with me.
A gun, bullets. A brick, just in case.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.718
- Right?
- Okay.

09:12.969 --> 09:15.096
I was gonna do it just like
you told me to.

09:15.596 --> 09:16.722
<i>Wait in the shadows</i>

09:17.223 --> 09:21.143
<i>by the side exit
until the dancers come out.</i>

09:22.478 --> 09:23.479
And then...

09:28.401 --> 09:30.444
There was a parade.

09:36.534 --> 09:37.702
- A parade?
- Yeah.

09:37.827 --> 09:39.328
You know, a parade.

09:41.622 --> 09:42.665
Come on!

09:42.665 --> 09:44.250
Yes, I know what a parade is, Ray.

09:44.250 --> 09:46.919
Yeah, and somewhere
amidst all that chaos...

09:52.592 --> 09:53.634
I lost it.

09:54.719 --> 09:55.720
You lost what?

09:56.637 --> 09:57.680
The gun!

09:58.139 --> 10:00.057
- You lost the gun?
- There was a parade.

10:00.057 --> 10:01.183
How do you lose a gun?

10:01.183 --> 10:02.977
Cause' I was getting knocked around.

10:02.977 --> 10:04.812
- You don't know...
- What is wrong with you?

10:04.812 --> 10:06.314
I just got off the plane.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.565
- I got jetlag.
- Jetlag?

10:07.565 --> 10:09.775
What? How do you lose a gun
in a fucking parade?

10:09.775 --> 10:11.152
All right. I'm sorry, okay?

10:11.152 --> 10:13.613
- Did you get anything right?
- I'm trying here.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.739
- You failed!
- Okay.

10:15.615 --> 10:18.367
I'm gonna make it up to you. I promise.
I'm gonna make this right.

10:18.367 --> 10:21.287
I will not accept the other half
of the money until I finish the job.

10:21.287 --> 10:22.371
Obviously.

10:22.371 --> 10:25.374
And if I fail, I'll give you back
every cent you've given me.

10:25.541 --> 10:28.210
- That's right.
- That is $37,500,

10:28.961 --> 10:33.049
half of the 75k you offered
to take out the three Adonis dancers.

10:33.049 --> 10:36.469
The other half payable upon
completion of the job, right?

10:37.053 --> 10:38.054
Huh?

10:42.433 --> 10:43.434
Right?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.575
- Who is calling you?
- I don't know.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.702
- You don't know anyone in Switzerland.
- I know.

11:01.702 --> 11:03.496
- Who could be calling you?
- I don't know.

11:03.496 --> 11:05.331
- Are you going to answer it?
- I don't know.

11:07.041 --> 11:08.042
Answer it.

11:19.470 --> 11:20.471
Hello.

11:24.266 --> 11:25.726
No, no one by that name.

11:31.065 --> 11:32.274
Yes. Okay, no problem.

11:34.819 --> 11:35.945
Who was that?

11:37.113 --> 11:39.615
Front desk got our room
confused with another room.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.577
- What the fuck is going on?
- Nothing.

11:44.912 --> 11:46.872
- Why are all these phones ringing?
- Front desk,

11:46.872 --> 11:48.958
- they're looking for someone.
- In multiple rooms?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.210
I don't know. I don't care.
And it's whatever.

11:51.210 --> 11:53.003
- They're onto us.
- No one is onto us.

11:53.003 --> 11:54.588
- They can hear us.
- No one hears us.

11:54.588 --> 11:55.715
These walls are thick.

11:55.715 --> 11:58.300
Did you know Switzerland has
the thickest walls in the world?

11:58.300 --> 12:00.553
- It's fucking cold, man. Look.
- I don't like this.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.763
- I'm leaving.
- Hey, man. You need to relax, okay?

12:03.055 --> 12:04.140
Have a beer.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.349
I don't drink beer.

12:06.434 --> 12:08.144
- A whiskey, then.
- I don't want whiskey.

12:09.061 --> 12:10.730
Come on. We always drink whiskey.

12:11.647 --> 12:12.773
No, we don't.

12:13.899 --> 12:15.860
You and me, we drank whiskey together.

12:17.027 --> 12:18.863
We don't drink whiskey together.

12:19.780 --> 12:20.990
Yes, we did at the club.

12:20.990 --> 12:23.492
We had whiskey together
on more than one occasion.

12:23.492 --> 12:24.702
I don't remember that.

12:26.203 --> 12:28.330
We drank whiskey together.

12:31.500 --> 12:33.043
We drank whiskey together.

12:34.837 --> 12:35.921
- No.
- Yes, we did.

12:35.921 --> 12:37.298
After the calendar.

12:37.798 --> 12:39.925
After the time
I committed arson for you.

12:39.925 --> 12:44.180
We drank whiskey together.
We shared a fellowship, Steve!

12:46.682 --> 12:48.893
I mean, what the shit, man?

12:50.186 --> 12:52.438
You and I drank whiskey every so often.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.024
And I like that we did. I fucking did.
I wouldn't have done

12:55.024 --> 12:58.027
all the dirty shit I did for you
if I didn't fucking like you.

12:58.027 --> 12:59.153
Do you see that?

12:59.153 --> 13:01.989
Do you understand
what I am trying to tell you?

13:06.327 --> 13:08.829
Let's have a drink, man.
Like the old days.

13:08.829 --> 13:11.957
Like the good old fucking days, man.

13:22.426 --> 13:23.552
Okay.

13:26.138 --> 13:27.223
There you go.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.725
There you go.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.527
To the good old days!

13:56.627 --> 13:58.462
- We did have some good times.
- Hmm.

14:00.756 --> 14:01.799
Yeah.

14:03.342 --> 14:04.426
We did.

14:06.178 --> 14:07.179
I miss it.

14:10.516 --> 14:12.434
Remember that time the sprinkler broke

14:12.434 --> 14:14.562
right in the middle of <i>It's Raining Men?</i>

14:15.813 --> 14:17.439
I do remember that.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.734
They all thought
it was part of the show.

14:21.068 --> 14:22.111
They loved it.

14:22.111 --> 14:23.863
Yup. I gotta be honest...

14:24.655 --> 14:26.490
When it first happened,

14:26.490 --> 14:28.576
I thought it was part
of the show, too.

14:28.576 --> 14:29.785
You did?

14:29.785 --> 14:31.453
The timing, it was too perfect.

14:31.453 --> 14:34.999
That's right! It was just as
the dancers popped their umbrellas.

14:34.999 --> 14:37.418
But when the alarm went off,
I was like...

14:37.418 --> 14:39.169
- The women went crazy.
- ...wait a second.

14:39.587 --> 14:41.630
<i>Rain coming down from the sky.</i>

14:41.630 --> 14:43.632
<i>In the middle of the fucking club!</i>

14:43.632 --> 14:45.384
How long is this going to go on?

14:45.634 --> 14:46.677
Patience.

14:48.512 --> 14:49.555
He's getting there.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.099
We've come this far.

14:52.975 --> 14:54.643
What's another couple hours?

15:17.333 --> 15:18.334
You him?

15:19.335 --> 15:20.377
Yeah.

15:20.628 --> 15:21.670
Yeah.

15:22.379 --> 15:23.464
Come on, come on.

15:29.595 --> 15:30.846
Get out. I gotta go.

15:31.096 --> 15:32.514
You're under arrest, motherfucker!

15:32.514 --> 15:34.767
Get on your knees, you fucking prick.

15:35.309 --> 15:36.936
I'll blow your fucking head off.

15:38.812 --> 15:41.106
You're looking
at 15 to 20, easy.

15:41.106 --> 15:43.025
Unless you give us something.

15:43.525 --> 15:45.361
Something fucking good.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.244
Garriola.

15:58.207 --> 15:59.583
I don't even know that guy.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.585
Really? Then explain this.

16:01.585 --> 16:05.631
Thirteen calls to him in the weeks
leading up to Nick's murder.

16:05.798 --> 16:10.219
That is a hell of a lot
of wrong numbers, isn't it?

16:11.220 --> 16:13.806
You want to tell us something
about Steve Banerjee,

16:13.806 --> 16:15.641
or do you want to rot in jail forever?

16:15.641 --> 16:17.893
He's a handyman
for the club whose services

16:17.893 --> 16:21.397
- apparently include arranging hits.
- And the occasional arson job.

16:21.397 --> 16:23.107
Still doesn't
solve your problem.

16:23.107 --> 16:25.859
- What problem is that?
- Hard evidence linking Banerjee

16:25.859 --> 16:26.986
to the De Noia murder.

16:26.986 --> 16:29.655
Without a smoking gun
or a taped confession...

16:29.780 --> 16:30.948
Funny you should mention it.

16:31.073 --> 16:33.033
- You got the murder weapon?
- The other one.

16:33.033 --> 16:34.910
- You have him on tape?
- No, but we will.

16:35.035 --> 16:37.788
The dancer hit.
He wants Colon to try again.

16:37.913 --> 16:40.290
He's flying him to Switzerland
to talk it over.

16:40.290 --> 16:41.709
We just want to tag along.

16:42.835 --> 16:45.796
I don't like any of this.
I should not have agreed to meet you.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.465
Look, Steve, let's go to my hotel, man.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.467
- It's across the street.
- They're on the move.

16:50.467 --> 16:52.845
There's a mini bar.
We have some beers, right?

16:53.137 --> 16:56.098
Keep talking. You know,
total privacy, man. Just you and me.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.392
Let's keep talking, man.

17:00.019 --> 17:01.020
Be nice to catch up.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.696
Can I tell you something?

17:11.530 --> 17:14.366
- Sure.
- Those early years?

17:16.326 --> 17:17.953
Best years of my life, man.

17:19.705 --> 17:20.706
You and me,

17:21.665 --> 17:24.668
Mrs. Banerjee, Denise...

17:27.504 --> 17:28.547
Nick.

17:31.383 --> 17:32.509
It's better now.

17:34.136 --> 17:35.679
Revenue has never been higher.

17:35.679 --> 17:37.931
Double-digit growth
for four years straight.

17:38.766 --> 17:41.894
I have clubs in four cities,
tours spanning three continents.

17:42.478 --> 17:44.063
Next year, we're going to Asia.

17:45.564 --> 17:47.357
Tokyo, Singapore, maybe even China.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.942
But don't you ever get lonely?

17:49.610 --> 17:52.362
- Lonely?
- Back then it was all of us. Now...

17:53.739 --> 17:55.282
That makes it even more impressive.

17:55.282 --> 17:57.076
The fact that I'm doing it
all by myself.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.160
That's true.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.245
That's how it started, right?
With just me.

18:01.789 --> 18:04.458
I thought of it. Without me,
there is no Chippendales.

18:08.212 --> 18:09.505
You ever hear from Irene?

18:13.050 --> 18:14.718
What does she have to do with it?

18:15.177 --> 18:16.261
I was just wondering.

18:20.099 --> 18:21.350
It has been some time.

18:22.851 --> 18:24.812
How's your daughter? You see her much?

18:28.148 --> 18:29.274
She's seven years old.

18:30.567 --> 18:31.735
Seven already.

18:32.152 --> 18:33.737
She's crazy about horses.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.157
Daddy gonna buy her one?

18:44.915 --> 18:47.209
You know you got
nothing to apologize for.

18:50.295 --> 18:51.713
- What?
- The stuff you did.

18:53.048 --> 18:54.174
You had your reasons.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.554
- Of course I did.
- Steve...

18:59.555 --> 19:00.639
You can talk to me.

19:01.306 --> 19:02.307
I'm your friend.

19:02.307 --> 19:03.392
What do you mean?

19:03.600 --> 19:07.020
I can see that things
are weighing on you.

19:07.020 --> 19:08.230
Nothing is weighing on me.

19:08.355 --> 19:11.233
I refuse to believe that.
A man's gotta have a conscience.

19:15.028 --> 19:16.155
You ever done therapy?

19:17.406 --> 19:19.158
- Therapy?
- Yeah, I've done it a few times.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.368
- It really works.
- I know nothing about therapy.

19:21.368 --> 19:22.452
It's incredible.

19:23.162 --> 19:26.039
What you do is,
you take what you're feeling, right?

19:26.039 --> 19:30.210
Whatever's weighing on you.
And you say it out loud.

19:31.795 --> 19:32.921
Why would you do that?

19:34.631 --> 19:37.718
Because the act of saying it out loud
makes it go away.

19:37.718 --> 19:39.678
It's like a magic trick, right?

19:39.678 --> 19:41.513
You say it out loud and... Poof!

19:41.513 --> 19:44.224
It's gone off your chest forever.

19:44.224 --> 19:46.643
You don't feel it anymore ever again.

19:47.060 --> 19:48.145
- So silly.
- It's not.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.647
- I'm telling you, bro. It works. Try it.
- What?

19:50.647 --> 19:52.774
- Right now. Try it.
- What are you talking about?

19:52.774 --> 19:56.570
I'm talking about saying the stuff
you feel bad about out loud.

19:56.778 --> 19:57.905
That's okay.

19:58.238 --> 19:59.573
- What's the harm?
- No, thanks.

19:59.573 --> 20:02.242
It's just me. You're not gonna say
something I don't already...

20:02.242 --> 20:03.327
No.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.217
Okay.

20:18.217 --> 20:21.553
I'mma go. I'mma do therapy because I got

20:21.553 --> 20:23.639
some things I gotta get off of my chest.

20:31.521 --> 20:34.149
- So, back in London...
- Yes?

20:37.903 --> 20:39.029
I didn't lose the gun.

20:41.031 --> 20:43.033
- What?
- And there was no parade.

20:43.825 --> 20:46.912
- There was no parade?
- I made it up.

20:47.996 --> 20:48.997
All of it.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.627
I never went to the theater.
I never even left the hotel.

20:55.796 --> 20:56.880
Is this some kind of joke?

20:57.089 --> 21:00.300
I chickened out, man.
I didn't have the balls to do it.

21:01.510 --> 21:05.097
- So you just lied to me.
- That's what I'm confessing.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.348
How could you do this to me?

21:06.556 --> 21:08.725
I'm baring my soul here, man!

21:08.725 --> 21:09.810
You idiot!

21:13.021 --> 21:14.523
I trusted you, and you betrayed me.

21:14.523 --> 21:15.816
- Betrayed you?
- Yes.

21:15.816 --> 21:17.734
I didn't want to do it
in the first place!

21:17.734 --> 21:18.986
You forced me into it.

21:18.986 --> 21:21.113
- I didn't force you.
- I was scared if I said no,

21:21.113 --> 21:23.407
you'd kill me,
just like you killed Nick De Noia.

21:32.291 --> 21:34.793
Come on, Steve. Acknowledge.

21:49.850 --> 21:50.976
Give me back my money.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.273
What money?

21:56.690 --> 22:00.444
- The half.
- For the hit on the three dancers?

22:01.194 --> 22:02.863
- Yes, you idiot.
- Don't call me that.

22:03.113 --> 22:05.615
That's what you are.
An idiot who can't get anything right.

22:05.615 --> 22:07.117
I got the Nick De Noia hit right.

22:07.117 --> 22:09.661
You were just the middleman.
Anybody could have done that.

22:09.661 --> 22:10.746
- Not true.
- It's true.

22:10.746 --> 22:12.539
I had money.
He had the gun and the balls.

22:12.539 --> 22:13.707
- You had nothing.
- So what?

22:13.707 --> 22:16.084
You just needed someone
to get money from you to him.

22:16.084 --> 22:18.086
- Yes.
- The murder wasn't traced back to you.

22:18.086 --> 22:19.463
- Yes.
- So they wouldn't know

22:19.463 --> 22:21.715
you're the one who ordered
the hit on Nick.

22:21.715 --> 22:22.841
Yes, you idiot!

22:22.841 --> 22:24.217
Yes, yes!

22:43.862 --> 22:44.988
What are you doing?

22:47.741 --> 22:48.950
- Come on, y'all.
- Ray?

22:49.409 --> 22:51.995
- What are you doing?
- Don't leave me hanging, is that it?

22:56.917 --> 22:58.126
Steve...

22:58.460 --> 23:00.128
Steve, what are you doing, man?

23:00.796 --> 23:04.758
Steve, you're going
straight-up crazy, a'ight?

23:07.427 --> 23:08.512
What are you doing?

23:10.889 --> 23:12.724
Steve, I wouldn't do that to you.

23:15.519 --> 23:18.480
You're freaking me out, already.
Would you stop, Steve?

23:27.406 --> 23:28.824
I'm sorry, boss.

23:31.576 --> 23:33.703
Freeze!
Get on the fucking ground.

23:33.703 --> 23:35.288
Let me see your fucking hands.

23:55.725 --> 23:57.144
I'm sorry.

24:08.905 --> 24:11.283
Shit. I mean, this is bad.

24:12.075 --> 24:14.161
I mean, you're facing charges that could

24:14.161 --> 24:16.913
- put you away for life.
- But you'll defend me.

24:16.913 --> 24:18.081
You'll get me out of this.

24:18.081 --> 24:19.916
No, you don't want me defending you.

24:19.916 --> 24:22.544
Not on this. You need a top
criminal defense attorney.

24:23.378 --> 24:25.172
- Who?
- I'll get you some names.

24:34.431 --> 24:36.349
Have you spoken with Irene?

24:37.392 --> 24:40.937
- Have you?
- No, she...

24:42.981 --> 24:44.441
She doesn't want to know me.

24:49.905 --> 24:52.657
If things don't go well for me,
you'll take care of her?

24:53.241 --> 24:54.493
I'll do my best.

24:55.118 --> 24:57.996
You haven't exactly left her
in the best position, though.

25:01.458 --> 25:02.667
She'll have the company.

25:05.629 --> 25:09.883
- What?
- You're being charged under RICO.

25:10.592 --> 25:11.635
RICO?

25:11.760 --> 25:14.513
Racketeer Influenced
and Corrupt Organizations Act.

25:14.721 --> 25:16.848
- What does that mean?
- It means that Chippendales

25:16.848 --> 25:19.351
has been classified
as a criminal organization.

25:19.726 --> 25:21.561
- What?
- Which means that the government

25:21.561 --> 25:24.147
has the right to seize all assets
upon your sentencing,

25:24.147 --> 25:25.565
including the business itself.

25:25.565 --> 25:28.985
- They're going to take my company?
- Down to the drink coasters and thongs.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.113
But in the divorce settlement,

25:32.405 --> 25:35.492
I said Irene, if anything happens to me,
Irene gets the company.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.035
That's what the settlement says.

25:37.202 --> 25:40.330
- That is all out the window now.
- But she did nothing wrong.

25:40.330 --> 25:42.290
She didn't even know about this.
I did this.

25:42.290 --> 25:44.251
She didn't know about this.

25:44.501 --> 25:46.294
I did this. This was me.

25:47.587 --> 25:50.840
She didn't know about this.
She didn't do anything wrong.

27:06.249 --> 27:08.335
Stop it. You deserve everything you got.

27:10.920 --> 27:12.047
Oh, that's right.

27:12.797 --> 27:17.052
You never saw this. That's why we had to
do a closed casket.

27:24.017 --> 27:26.144
Here's the thing I don't get, Steve.

27:27.812 --> 27:29.439
You know, I get killing me.

27:30.315 --> 27:32.651
I mean, I don't get it, but I get it.

27:32.651 --> 27:33.818
You were jealous.

27:33.818 --> 27:37.113
I was taking your spotlight,
your money, standard stuff.

27:37.238 --> 27:42.077
But those dancers in London? Come on.

27:42.243 --> 27:43.286
They were ripping me off.

27:43.286 --> 27:45.288
Yeah, there's always
going to be competitors...

27:45.288 --> 27:48.208
- They were ripping me off.
- Like the Electric Tomato?

27:51.586 --> 27:53.838
God. You don't even know what that is.

27:54.339 --> 27:56.675
The club that you burned down
because they were doing

27:56.675 --> 27:58.885
some stupid male stripper night.

28:01.554 --> 28:04.224
You won, Steve. You fucking won!

28:04.891 --> 28:05.934
The war was over.

28:05.934 --> 28:09.062
You conquered your rivals,
you vanquished your foes.

28:09.229 --> 28:12.482
But somehow, you didn't get the memo.

28:12.774 --> 28:15.402
When you're someone like me,
you can't stop fighting.

28:15.902 --> 28:16.903
Aw.

28:16.903 --> 28:18.029
Someone like you.

28:19.698 --> 28:22.659
Outsider, underdog, immigrant.

28:23.034 --> 28:26.996
I see. You can't make an American dream
omelet without breaking a few eggs.

28:26.996 --> 28:28.581
Yes. Yes.

28:33.378 --> 28:35.630
You know, I said it before
and I'll say it again.

28:35.630 --> 28:39.676
You, Steve Banerjee,
are one fucked-up dude.

28:40.635 --> 28:42.095
I am sorry you feel that way.

28:43.221 --> 28:46.182
Everyone feels that way.
Everyone who's ever met you.

28:47.475 --> 28:48.601
Including Irene.

28:53.815 --> 28:58.194
- Irene, Irene, Irene.
- Leave her out of this.

28:58.194 --> 29:02.866
She's going to be left with nothing.
All because you needed everything.

29:02.991 --> 29:04.117
She'll be fine.

29:04.117 --> 29:06.119
In what fucking universe?

29:07.537 --> 29:10.290
I'm sorry. It's upsetting.
We don't have to talk about her.

29:16.337 --> 29:19.924
The reality is... You fucked her.

29:22.051 --> 29:25.889
Oh, man, you fucked her good.

29:25.889 --> 29:26.973
She'll be fine.

29:26.973 --> 29:28.141
Single mother,

29:28.141 --> 29:31.644
business empire snatched away,
all because you had to take out

29:31.644 --> 29:34.063
three random-ass strippers?

29:36.024 --> 29:37.108
I will take care of her.

29:37.108 --> 29:39.360
- I will handle it.
- No, there's no handling this one,

29:39.360 --> 29:43.823
Stevie Boy. You can't put out a hit
on the American criminal justice system.

29:47.243 --> 29:50.079
The moment you're sentenced,
the government takes it all.

29:51.831 --> 29:53.333
She'll be left with nothing.

29:56.377 --> 29:57.670
Please go.

30:01.090 --> 30:02.217
Just go.

30:02.801 --> 30:03.802
I'm already gone.

30:49.973 --> 30:52.267
<i>How was your weekend?
Fantastic.</i>

30:52.392 --> 30:53.685
Did absolutely nothing.

30:54.018 --> 30:56.855
That's my kind of weekend,
when the wife lets me get away with it.

30:56.855 --> 30:58.481
Hear that.

31:33.474 --> 31:34.517
Hurry!

31:44.611 --> 31:45.987
I got it. No, I got it.

31:45.987 --> 31:48.448
Damn it. Give me a little more slack.

31:48.448 --> 31:50.116
Shit. Jesus Christ.

32:13.973 --> 32:15.475
Who the hell is this guy?

32:16.142 --> 32:20.647
Steve Banerjee.
He invented Chippendales.

32:21.356 --> 32:25.026
That guy?
Chippendales?

32:27.904 --> 32:31.950
Man. Doreen,
she fucking loved that place.

33:08.569 --> 33:10.321
- Well done tonight.
- Thanks, boss.

33:13.825 --> 33:15.785
Bobby! One Coke.

33:26.879 --> 33:28.006
One Coke, boss.

33:28.006 --> 33:29.465
Thank you, Bobby.

33:31.175 --> 33:33.678
- Hey, fantastic look.
- I know!

33:53.072 --> 33:54.115
Irene!

33:54.991 --> 33:56.159
Hey.

34:01.539 --> 34:04.250
- Thank you.
- You know I'll always take care of you.
