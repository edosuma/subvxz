<i>Tonight was your first time
at the club, wasn't it?</i>

00:31.323 --> 00:33.950
<i>No, I've been there
a few times before.</i>

00:33.951 --> 00:36.661
<i>Really? How come
I haven't seen you?</i>

00:36.662 --> 00:39.622
<i>I noticed you the first
night I walked in.</i>

00:39.623 --> 00:41.020
<i>You always stand out.</i>

00:41.959 --> 00:45.378
<i>Well, thank you.</i>

00:45.379 --> 00:48.714
<i>How come it took you till
tonight to talk to me?</i>

00:48.715 --> 00:51.634
<i>You're not shy, are you?</i>

00:51.635 --> 00:53.328
<i>Maybe a little.</i>

01:06.817 --> 01:09.402
<i>Are you okay with this?</i>

01:09.403 --> 01:13.406
<i>Just taking off with
someone you hardly know?</i>

01:13.407 --> 01:15.491
<i>I trust myself.</i>

01:15.492 --> 01:16.701
<i>What do you mean?</i>

01:16.702 --> 01:18.578
<i>Well, I believe in human nature.</i>

01:18.579 --> 01:20.977
<i>You know, that</i>

01:20.998 --> 01:22.832
<i>people are basically good.</i>

01:22.833 --> 01:25.356
<i>You're right, most people are.</i>

01:32.884 --> 01:37.263
<i>Tracie. You spell that
with a "Y" or an "I-E"?</i>

01:37.264 --> 01:41.995
<i>"I-E Guys are always
assuming I'm a "T-R-A-C-Y. "</i>

01:43.437 --> 01:45.605
<i>How I hate guys who assume.</i>

01:45.606 --> 01:47.003
<i>Me, too.</i>

01:56.325 --> 02:00.953
<i>- You look like a James.
- Nope, just Jim.</i>

02:00.954 --> 02:03.978
<i>- How about Jimmy?
- No, just Jim.</i>

02:06.209 --> 02:08.232
<i>Oh, come on, you are shy.</i>

02:14.551 --> 02:18.906
<i>Look, uh, there's something
I have been meaning to tell you.</i>

02:19.931 --> 02:21.999
<i>I think you have beautiful hair.</i>

02:22.392 --> 02:24.518
<i>- Oh, you think so?
- Yeah.</i>

02:24.519 --> 02:27.714
<i>Brown Bag, this is Brown
Bird, we have audio-visual.</i>

02:27.731 --> 02:29.833
<i>Do you think it's sexy?</i>

02:30.609 --> 02:32.652
Brown Bag, close into one click.

02:32.653 --> 02:36.864
<i>Oh, yeah. There's nothing sexier than
short hair on a beautiful woman.</i>

02:36.865 --> 02:40.284
What is it about big
hair that turns men on?

02:40.285 --> 02:43.935
What is it about big hair
that turns guys on, anyway?

02:45.707 --> 02:47.309
<i>Bad taste.</i>

02:48.835 --> 02:52.405
<i>Look at me. I want
to see your eyes.</i>

02:55.676 --> 03:00.031
<i>Innocent, just the way I like them.</i>

03:01.181 --> 03:04.266
That's him. That's our man.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.727
Car is registered to a Jim Gelway.

03:06.728 --> 03:08.889
<i>Brown Bird, this is
Brown Bag. Move in.</i>

03:20.409 --> 03:23.012
He's testing, Tracie. Tell him

03:24.788 --> 03:26.686
he's got the Midas touch.

03:28.625 --> 03:30.819
You got the Midas touch.

03:32.587 --> 03:35.782
That's 'cause I'm
God's gift to women.

03:38.176 --> 03:40.825
<i>And you know what I think you are?</i>

03:42.556 --> 03:45.641
I think you're a
natural-born cocksucker

03:45.642 --> 03:49.270
and I think it's time you did
what you were born to do.

03:49.271 --> 03:50.748
No.

03:51.940 --> 03:53.542
What is this?

03:54.609 --> 03:57.588
- What the fuck is this?
- Oh, shit!

03:57.654 --> 03:59.447
<i>- Fucking bitch!</i>
- Bust him!

03:59.448 --> 04:02.893
<i>Brown Bird, Brown Bag, move in!
Take him! Take him now! Now!</i>

04:03.869 --> 04:06.328
<i>Pull your vehicle to the side
of the road and keep your hands</i>

04:06.329 --> 04:07.496
<i>- where I can see them.</i>
- Fuck!

04:07.497 --> 04:10.958
Police! Pull over, now!

04:10.959 --> 04:12.042
I got him, Alex.

04:32.481 --> 04:33.939
Call for help, now!

04:33.940 --> 04:37.443
Tracie! Hold on! Don't move!

04:37.444 --> 04:40.571
Stay where you are! Stay still!

04:44.534 --> 04:46.994
Tracie, hold on, we're
going to get you!

04:46.995 --> 04:49.580
- Come on, guys!
- There's nothing to hook on to!

04:49.581 --> 04:52.875
- Give me a hand!
- Hold on!

04:52.876 --> 04:54.193
Alex?

04:56.755 --> 04:58.152
Tracie!

05:30.247 --> 05:31.872
- Hey, Hannah.
- Hi, Megan.

05:31.873 --> 05:34.271
I hope we don't have
that big math test.

05:40.507 --> 05:43.092
- Jezzie.
- Hey, Megan.

05:43.093 --> 05:46.572
Jezzie, guess who called
me again last night?

05:46.596 --> 05:48.556
Oh, let's see, um...

05:48.557 --> 05:50.975
Ah! Good morning, Dimitri.

05:50.976 --> 05:54.353
Hey, Megan, I downloaded some really
cool GIFs. You want to see them?

05:54.354 --> 05:56.146
Yeah, sure. What are they?

05:56.147 --> 05:57.648
We'll see inside.

05:57.649 --> 05:59.467
Agent Flannigan.

06:04.322 --> 06:07.283
Control, check in
Starodubov and Rose.

06:07.284 --> 06:08.601
Check!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.578
Hey, Jezz, what do we call
the Ruskies these days?

06:10.579 --> 06:13.205
Russians, former Soviets? I forget.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.230
<i>New World Order, Devine.
Get used to it.</i>

06:19.921 --> 06:25.175
Charles Lindbergh, Lucky Lindy,
or The Lone Eagle, as he was called,

06:25.176 --> 06:30.222
is our subject today because
he was the first man to what?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.600
- Megan?
- Fly over the Atlantic?

06:32.601 --> 06:36.854
Very good. First man to fly solo,
non-stop from New York City to Paris,

06:36.855 --> 06:40.691
and that was 1927. An
astonishing accomplishment.

06:40.692 --> 06:44.236
Which brings us to
today's assignment.

06:44.237 --> 06:49.033
Let's see which of you can
navigate, or fly, if you will,

06:49.034 --> 06:53.245
from our home base to
our hero's website here

06:53.246 --> 06:55.623
in the fewest number of links.

06:55.624 --> 06:57.917
All right, and you're off.

07:19.189 --> 07:21.542
That's very clever, Dimitri.

07:55.642 --> 07:58.370
Megan, might I have
a word with you?

07:59.062 --> 08:01.415
- Save me a seat, okay?
- Okay.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.213
Come to my office.

08:09.572 --> 08:11.174
Take a seat.

08:14.577 --> 08:19.665
Now, Megan, you know I understand
the particular pressures of your life.

08:19.666 --> 08:22.376
Your father being who he is.

08:22.377 --> 08:26.463
The enormous expectations, all adds
up to rather a lot, doesn't it?

08:26.464 --> 08:28.132
- Yes, sir.
- Mmm.

08:28.133 --> 08:33.511
But none of that excuses your
breaking the honour code.

08:33.513 --> 08:34.888
What?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.765
I know all about you
and Dimitri, Megan.

08:37.767 --> 08:39.559
We don't tolerate
cheating, now, do we?

08:39.561 --> 08:43.272
Cheating? Mr Soneji,
there's been a mistake.

08:43.273 --> 08:45.607
We only pass notes, you
know, jokes and stuff.

08:45.608 --> 08:48.777
Megan, before you go any further,

08:48.778 --> 08:51.051
best have a look at that.

08:55.118 --> 08:56.285
Mr Soneji?

08:56.286 --> 08:57.453
Yes?

08:57.454 --> 09:00.558
This essay, it isn't mine.

09:00.582 --> 09:02.355
Beg your pardon?

09:03.251 --> 09:04.477
What do you mean?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.964
Oh, my...

09:08.965 --> 09:12.134
Oh, dear girl, I'm...

09:12.135 --> 09:13.908
Oh, dear, dear...

09:39.454 --> 09:41.080
Gary, why is the door locked?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.248
Oh, my God! What happened?

09:43.249 --> 09:45.250
She's collapsed. She's just
collapsed. I'll tell you what,

09:45.251 --> 09:47.169
you stay with her,
I'll get some help.

09:47.170 --> 09:52.697
Okay. Megan? Hey, sweetheart,
can you hear me? Megan?

09:56.513 --> 09:58.847
- Hey, Jezzie.
- Hi, Kila.

09:58.848 --> 10:02.452
- Hey, Hannah, where's Megan?
- She's with Mr Soneji.

10:18.868 --> 10:21.537
Control, I'm en route
to Soneji's classroom.

10:21.538 --> 10:23.622
I'm sure it's just a
meeting that went long.

10:23.623 --> 10:27.273
Well, it's against procedure.
Mr Soneji should know better.

10:48.314 --> 10:49.836
His office.

11:00.201 --> 11:02.599
Mr Soneji? Secret Service, open up.

11:05.832 --> 11:07.354
Mr Soneji?

11:10.170 --> 11:11.692
Do you have a key?

11:17.177 --> 11:20.095
I'm sorry, there seems to
be something stuck in here.

11:20.096 --> 11:21.618
Stand back.

11:33.109 --> 11:36.554
Control, shut down. Stop all
vehicles. Lock on Soneji and Rose.

12:28.164 --> 12:31.250
So, how many of these
boats you have to make

12:31.251 --> 12:33.695
before you become shipshape?

12:37.966 --> 12:41.570
I have never seen a man work
so hard at looking busy.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.783
Alex, it's been eight months.

12:47.809 --> 12:50.287
It's time you forgave yourself.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.964
Vickie,

13:02.699 --> 13:07.305
you know that forgiving yourself is
the one thing a person cannot do.

13:19.132 --> 13:20.465
<i>Choose to make contact.</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:23.051
<i>We are currently trying to
put the pieces together</i>

13:23.052 --> 13:26.388
<i>as to how and why this man
would murder a teacher</i>

13:26.389 --> 13:28.307
<i>and kidnap a young student.</i>

13:28.308 --> 13:30.661
<i>Here's a photograph of
the missing student.</i>

13:30.685 --> 13:33.334
<i>Megan Ann Rose is 12 years old.</i>

13:33.354 --> 13:35.230
<i>Blonde hair with hazel eyes.</i>

13:35.231 --> 13:39.318
<i>She's 3'5" tall, and
weighs about 52 pounds.</i>

13:39.319 --> 13:43.905
<i>She was last seen inside the school,
with the suspect, around noon today.</i>

13:43.906 --> 13:48.493
<i>We have just received information that
senior FBI and Secret Service officials</i>

13:48.494 --> 13:51.580
<i>have arrived at the family
home of Senator Rose.</i>

13:51.581 --> 13:55.334
<i>We will go there live as soon
as we have our satellite feed.</i>

13:55.335 --> 13:58.420
<i>Technicians are setting up extra
telephone lines at the Rose home,</i>

13:58.421 --> 14:00.364
<i>all in preparation,
should the kidnapper...</i>

14:38.461 --> 14:39.733
Mom...

14:41.381 --> 14:42.858
Please.

14:43.591 --> 14:45.819
I want to go home.

14:46.386 --> 14:50.639
<i>The FBI and police are on the
lookout for this man, Gary Soneji.</i>

14:50.640 --> 14:52.307
<i>This is a recent
school photograph...</i>

14:52.308 --> 14:53.809
<i>We only know that
he has disappeared</i>

14:53.810 --> 14:56.311
<i>with the 12-year-old daughter
of Senator Hank Rose,</i>

14:56.312 --> 14:57.896
<i>how and why is on the mind of...</i>

14:57.897 --> 15:00.816
<i>Police are trying to find
out who this man really is,</i>

15:00.817 --> 15:03.485
<i>his motives for killing
teacher Amy Masterson</i>

15:03.486 --> 15:05.570
<i>and the kidnapping of Megan Rose.</i>

15:05.571 --> 15:08.490
<i>We go back live to join
reporter Alison Peretsky,</i>

15:08.491 --> 15:12.494
<i>who has been at the scene since law
enforcement officials arrived.</i>

15:12.495 --> 15:13.596
<i>Thank you, Jamie.</i>

15:13.621 --> 15:16.665
<i>It's now approximately four hours
since this tragic story unfolded...</i>

15:16.666 --> 15:17.833
Yes?

15:17.834 --> 15:19.231
<i>Mom...</i>

15:20.837 --> 15:22.280
<i>Please.</i>

15:22.922 --> 15:24.865
<i>I want to go home.</i>

15:26.175 --> 15:27.276
Hello?

15:30.596 --> 15:33.290
You tuned into me, Dr Cross?

15:33.307 --> 15:36.911
<i>That sounds like Alison
Peretsky at WNKW Action News.</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:39.626
Gary Soneji?

15:40.690 --> 15:42.087
That'll do for now.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.429
How did you get this number?

15:48.197 --> 15:51.199
Unlisted numbers? Come on,
Alex, there's no such thing.

15:51.200 --> 15:54.270
It's all out there in the air, you
just have to know how to grab it.

15:55.121 --> 15:57.956
<i>Hey, how do you feel about my
kidnapping being bigger news</i>

15:57.957 --> 16:00.560
<i>than your little tragedy
there with Jim Gelway?</i>

16:01.210 --> 16:04.880
You know, you really ought to give an
interview about what happened that night.

16:04.881 --> 16:06.824
You know what they say about
sharing your pain, it's

16:06.841 --> 16:09.551
<i>very cathartic.</i>

16:09.552 --> 16:11.154
Thanks, but I'm doing okay.

16:11.888 --> 16:15.709
Well, see, now, that's good
to hear. That's very good.

16:15.725 --> 16:18.423
I thought for a while there you
wouldn't be able to get your act back

16:18.428 --> 16:20.330
together and that
would be a great shame.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.670
<i>I have been planning
for a long, long time</i>

16:23.691 --> 16:26.510
<i>to involve you in the fate
of our Little Miss Muffet.</i>

16:27.570 --> 16:29.013
Megan.

16:30.364 --> 16:31.804
Do you have trouble
saying her name?

16:35.620 --> 16:39.247
First name rapport? Is that
Hostage Negotiations 101?

16:39.248 --> 16:41.817
Now, come on, Alex, you can do
better than that, can't you?

16:42.877 --> 16:46.197
<i>Do you think you're going to dissect
me in three blinks of an eye?</i>

16:46.589 --> 16:49.299
I'm not that easy.

16:49.300 --> 16:52.870
But with a little patience
and a little help,

16:52.887 --> 16:55.206
you just might profile me to a T.

16:56.599 --> 16:58.372
What makes you think
I'm interested?

17:00.603 --> 17:04.173
They say that when
I die, the case will die.

17:05.983 --> 17:08.551
They say it will be like
a book that I closed.

17:09.612 --> 17:12.761
<i>But the book, it will never close.</i>

17:15.284 --> 17:17.887
Very poetic. What the hell is it?

17:19.454 --> 17:25.001
Uh, I have left you something for
your visit with the Roses tonight.

17:25.002 --> 17:26.900
You'll find it in your cold,

17:27.171 --> 17:29.339
<i>corrugated</i>

17:29.340 --> 17:31.442
<i>mailbox.</i>

17:31.801 --> 17:34.871
It's time to get back
to work, Dr Cross.

18:22.643 --> 18:25.061
<i>I have been planning
for a long, long time</i>

18:25.062 --> 18:28.132
<i>to involve you in the fate
of our Little Miss Muffet.</i>

18:28.899 --> 18:30.296
<i>Megan.</i>

18:30.901 --> 18:33.424
<i>Do you have trouble
saying her name?</i>

18:48.711 --> 18:51.781
Sorry, Detective,
this is a federal case.

18:53.174 --> 18:54.924
I've been invited.

18:54.925 --> 18:57.369
Bobby. Sir, we have a
detective down here

18:57.386 --> 18:59.864
who may have a piece of
evidence pertinent to the case.

18:59.889 --> 19:01.161
Alex?

19:02.600 --> 19:05.328
Special Agent Craig. Well, I'll be.

19:08.397 --> 19:09.999
Dare I ask?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.381
In my mailbox.

19:13.402 --> 19:15.345
Anything else?

19:16.864 --> 19:19.012
That'll get you inside.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.016
Terry.

19:23.037 --> 19:25.014
Get this to McArthur.

19:25.873 --> 19:28.396
- Who's in charge?
- Ollie McArthur.

19:28.417 --> 19:33.421
Pedigree FeBe, made his bones busting
wackos in the Seattle office.

19:33.422 --> 19:34.694
Soneji. Clean?

19:34.715 --> 19:38.259
Clean? Squeaky. Fibres look
generic, fingerprints, nada.

19:38.260 --> 19:41.364
The whole school's a
goddamn forensic vacuum.

19:41.389 --> 19:45.539
All he left us was one very
neatly strangled teacher.

19:45.559 --> 19:48.708
Heads are gonna roll
at the Secret Service.

19:50.314 --> 19:51.631
Oh...

19:52.274 --> 19:55.110
Jezzie Flannigan, Alex Cross.

19:55.111 --> 19:58.655
Agent Flannigan was in charge of the
Secret Service detail at Cathedral.

19:58.656 --> 20:00.724
- Dr Cross.
- Agent Flannigan.

20:00.741 --> 20:03.094
I've read your books on profiling.

20:03.119 --> 20:06.063
Obviously not close enough, but...

20:07.456 --> 20:12.437
Kyle, this shoe was IDed by
the Roses. It's Megan's.

20:12.461 --> 20:15.235
Dr Alex Cross, Special
Agent in Charge...

20:15.256 --> 20:17.279
- Oliver McArthur.
- How do you do, sir?

20:17.299 --> 20:19.276
Alex, I'll catch you later.

20:19.301 --> 20:21.278
- Forensics.
- Yes, sir.

20:21.679 --> 20:24.282
The Senator and Mrs
Rose are through here.

20:25.141 --> 20:26.914
But before we talk to them,

20:26.934 --> 20:29.913
have you any idea why
Soneji is involving you?

20:29.937 --> 20:31.789
Not at all.

20:31.814 --> 20:33.587
This way.

20:33.607 --> 20:36.651
Excuse me, shouldn't Agent
Flannigan be in the room with us?

20:36.652 --> 20:38.095
Not a good idea.

20:38.112 --> 20:39.805
Miss Flannigan is not welcome.

20:39.822 --> 20:42.141
But she's a material witness.

20:42.783 --> 20:46.703
She failed the Roses and
she failed the Service.

20:46.704 --> 20:49.038
I think Agent McArthur has a point.

20:49.039 --> 20:51.437
No, he's missing the point.

20:51.459 --> 20:55.712
You saw Soneji every day, five
days a week for how long?

20:55.713 --> 20:57.281
Two years.

20:57.298 --> 21:00.777
You have no idea how much
you know about this case.

21:06.515 --> 21:08.413
Agent Flannigan...

21:13.147 --> 21:17.093
<i>They say that when I die,
the case will die.</i>

21:17.985 --> 21:20.679
<i>They say it will be like
a book that I closed.</i>

21:21.489 --> 21:24.763
<i>But the book, it will never close.</i>

21:25.367 --> 21:27.845
<i>Very poetic. What the hell is it?</i>

21:27.870 --> 21:32.601
<i>I have left you something for your
visit with the Roses tonight.</i>

21:33.501 --> 21:38.152
<i>You'll find it in your cold,
corrugated mailbox.</i>

21:43.552 --> 21:47.430
Well, for what it's
worth, that's Soneji.

21:47.431 --> 21:49.704
His speech pattern's the same.

21:51.685 --> 21:54.062
Is he, um...

21:54.063 --> 21:57.383
Are we dealing with a sex maniac?

21:58.192 --> 22:00.636
Someone who might, you know...

22:01.946 --> 22:03.514
No, sir.

22:04.365 --> 22:07.059
This man has no such
interest in your daughter.

22:07.076 --> 22:09.178
She's merely a means to an end.

22:09.203 --> 22:11.021
What do you mean?

22:11.747 --> 22:15.522
I see no standard procedure
in anything he's done.

22:15.543 --> 22:16.626
I disagree.

22:16.627 --> 22:20.088
This is a professional kidnapping.
It's going to be about money.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.736
Which is good.

22:22.550 --> 22:25.403
But you're saying it
isn't about money?

22:27.596 --> 22:30.245
I think he wants to draw this out.

22:31.433 --> 22:34.753
From what he's said,
whatever his motives,

22:36.939 --> 22:38.837
it's very unusual.

22:42.945 --> 22:45.013
What did he mean about the book?

22:45.781 --> 22:48.009
That it will never close?

22:50.744 --> 22:52.954
I honestly don't know.

22:52.955 --> 22:55.683
Well, I think I do.

22:57.626 --> 23:02.072
Let me tell you what this
Gary Soneji is up to.

23:02.089 --> 23:05.739
The last thing he wants is
good crisis management.

23:05.759 --> 23:07.677
What he wants is to confuse.

23:07.678 --> 23:12.454
Rancour, mixed signals,
disorientation, those are his tools.

23:12.474 --> 23:15.418
So he calls a local cop.

23:15.436 --> 23:18.585
A damaged cop shouldering
some heavy baggage.

23:18.606 --> 23:20.754
He's using Dr Cross
as his messenger.

23:20.774 --> 23:24.924
Excuse me, the man that kidnapped
our daughter didn't call you,

23:24.945 --> 23:28.323
so your agenda is what, to
insult the man he did call?

23:28.324 --> 23:32.270
- Mrs Rose, I never intended...
- No, you wait a second.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.037
A mad man has our daughter

23:34.038 --> 23:37.108
and for some reason he
contacted this man.

23:38.542 --> 23:40.144
Do you know why?

23:42.838 --> 23:44.781
No, ma'am, not yet.

24:22.544 --> 24:23.861
Hello.

24:26.215 --> 24:27.658
You okay?

24:30.552 --> 24:36.159
You, uh, got any tips for
helpless situations?

24:38.352 --> 24:41.797
Well, you could smoke
a carton a day...

24:43.399 --> 24:45.900
or you could bounce back.

24:45.901 --> 24:49.722
Yeah, well, I don't see
anywhere to bounce to.

24:49.738 --> 24:51.886
Like to get out of here?

25:00.124 --> 25:02.477
Can I ask you something?

25:03.711 --> 25:05.028
Sure.

25:07.881 --> 25:11.827
What did McArthur mean when he
referred to you as damaged?

25:14.930 --> 25:18.751
Last summer I let a sting
operation get out of control.

25:20.394 --> 25:22.417
My partner was killed.

25:37.911 --> 25:41.185
Hey, Megan. How are you?

25:42.833 --> 25:45.231
Lovely to see you.

25:45.252 --> 25:47.446
Do you recognise my voice?

25:50.466 --> 25:51.909
It's me.

25:53.093 --> 25:54.615
Mr Soneji.

25:54.887 --> 25:55.988
Mmm-hmm.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.745
I brought you that.

25:59.767 --> 26:01.119
A lovely cup of tea with honey.

26:01.143 --> 26:03.917
I know your throat is sore.
It'll make you feel better.

26:03.937 --> 26:05.539
There you go.

26:06.148 --> 26:07.875
It's all right.

26:10.486 --> 26:13.385
You have nothing to
be scared of, Megan.

26:14.031 --> 26:16.157
I'm not scared.

26:16.158 --> 26:17.430
Good.

26:19.953 --> 26:22.371
But you're wondering
what's going on.

26:22.372 --> 26:24.040
I know what's going on,
you're a kidnapper

26:24.041 --> 26:26.209
and you're a sick weirdo.

26:29.296 --> 26:32.616
Megan, you're the most
opinionated girl in my class.

26:33.675 --> 26:36.779
- Think you got that from your mom?
- I want to go home.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.952
You Will.

26:38.972 --> 26:42.558
Just promise me you're going
to behave yourself, okay?

26:42.559 --> 26:44.286
That's all.

26:44.311 --> 26:48.166
Now, listen, if you need to use
the bathroom, or anything at all,

26:48.190 --> 26:50.133
just press that, okay?

26:50.150 --> 26:52.503
I want to go home! Now!

26:52.528 --> 26:54.346
Look, I brought you
some fresh clothes.

26:54.363 --> 26:58.013
Please! Mr Soneji, please!

27:00.035 --> 27:02.703
This is a fine gun.

27:02.704 --> 27:04.580
It's Turkish.

27:04.581 --> 27:08.026
Handmade, 1924.

27:08.043 --> 27:09.919
That is nice.

27:09.920 --> 27:13.866
My daddy won it in a game
of poker. Aces and Eights.

27:13.882 --> 27:15.655
Dead man's hand.

27:16.844 --> 27:20.164
That's about as much as
I know about my father.

27:21.181 --> 27:22.783
Have a seat.

27:28.397 --> 27:33.344
Do you know of any relationship
between Amy Masterson and Soneji?

27:33.360 --> 27:35.337
Amy? No way.

27:35.362 --> 27:38.072
Why do you ask?

27:38.073 --> 27:40.074
He strangled her.

27:40.075 --> 27:42.348
It's an act of passion.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.581
That's a demonstration of will.

27:46.582 --> 27:48.059
A message.

27:49.918 --> 27:52.862
Take me seriously. What do you see?

27:52.880 --> 27:55.590
- Dr Cross...
- Alex.

27:55.591 --> 27:58.069
Alex, women's intuition, third eye,

27:58.093 --> 28:00.094
sixth sense, whatever
it is, I don't have it.

28:00.095 --> 28:03.264
Sure you do, you just
don't look at it right.

28:03.265 --> 28:06.434
Every face has two aspects.

28:06.435 --> 28:08.811
Now try looking at it down the
middle one side at a time.

28:08.812 --> 28:11.415
Would you say this
man was confident?

28:11.440 --> 28:13.087
Yeah.

28:13.108 --> 28:16.052
- Narcissistic?
- I wouldn't know.

28:16.069 --> 28:19.218
- You ever see any flashes of hatred?
- No.

28:19.239 --> 28:20.386
- Anger?
- No.

28:20.407 --> 28:22.054
- Hostility?
- No.

28:22.618 --> 28:23.890
Look,

28:24.453 --> 28:26.772
everything about him was right.

28:26.788 --> 28:28.936
He was always patient.
He was pleasant.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.625
He had a sense of humour.

28:30.626 --> 28:33.400
I mean, he was the perfect teacher.

28:39.468 --> 28:41.696
What do you see?

28:43.472 --> 28:44.915
I see...

28:45.807 --> 28:47.750
No, I mean about me.

28:49.436 --> 28:51.584
What do you see about me?

28:52.856 --> 28:55.584
And that's why you're
here, isn't it?

28:55.651 --> 28:57.298
To size me up?

28:57.653 --> 29:00.597
Evaluate your primary
material witness?

29:04.493 --> 29:07.722
I see that you're about
to start an argument.

29:07.996 --> 29:09.497
I need to help get her back.

29:09.498 --> 29:10.978
What makes you think
I want a partner?

29:10.999 --> 29:12.333
- You don't.
- That's right.

29:12.334 --> 29:14.812
- I can understand that.
- No, you can't.

29:14.836 --> 29:17.314
Can I tell you why I don't care?

29:19.508 --> 29:20.860
Shoot

29:25.806 --> 29:27.078
Look.

29:28.308 --> 29:32.353
When I was assigned to Cathedral,
it was a job I didn't want.

29:32.354 --> 29:36.023
It's a far cry from working
rope-lines or flying Air Force One

29:36.024 --> 29:39.193
but I have been there
for three years.

29:39.194 --> 29:43.364
I have been responsible for
Megan for three years.

29:43.365 --> 29:47.118
And that little girl means more
to me than even a partner.

29:47.119 --> 29:49.267
Can you understand that?

29:52.499 --> 29:54.146
I suppose so.

29:55.544 --> 29:57.378
But even if I say no anyway,

29:57.379 --> 30:00.949
you'll probably just follow
me around wherever I go.

30:02.884 --> 30:07.555
So, if it's a choice between having
you as a partner or as a stalker,

30:07.556 --> 30:10.660
I guess I'll take my
chances with a partner.

30:14.521 --> 30:15.998
Thank you.

30:28.327 --> 30:31.021
The student drop-off is there.
That's my morning post.

30:31.038 --> 30:32.580
Student sign-in.

30:32.581 --> 30:36.250
Cameras are there,
there, there and there.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.195
Motion sensors all
around the periphery.

30:40.422 --> 30:43.196
Foolproof way to
keep the kooks out.

30:43.592 --> 30:47.367
Exactly, we were always looking
in the wrong direction.

30:47.763 --> 30:49.536
Which door did he go out?

30:49.598 --> 30:53.794
Uh, that one there. It's a straight
shot to his parking space.

30:57.397 --> 30:58.965
Let's go in.

31:06.448 --> 31:09.176
- His classroom.
- Mmm-hmm.

31:10.744 --> 31:14.644
He was teaching the kids how everything
on the Internet is connected.

31:15.290 --> 31:18.234
- Alex, you got a sec?
- Sure.

31:19.795 --> 31:23.900
Listen, I think turf wars
are a total waste of time.

31:23.924 --> 31:27.385
If I was out of line
last night, I apologise.

31:27.386 --> 31:29.534
Don't. I've been there.

31:31.973 --> 31:35.373
- Anything you need, you let me know.
- Sure, Mac.

31:37.229 --> 31:40.253
Doctor Cross, you might
want to see this.

31:47.823 --> 31:50.051
- This is Megan's desk?
- Yes.

31:51.451 --> 31:52.743
What are you doing?

31:52.744 --> 31:56.599
Scoping GIFs. Graphic
Interchange Formats.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.499
They're all stego-encrypted.

31:58.500 --> 32:01.502
Somewhere among the billions of
zeros and ones making up this image

32:01.503 --> 32:03.504
is a string of text.

32:03.505 --> 32:06.841
I know about this, it's the cutting-edge
method of passing notes in class.

32:06.842 --> 32:09.445
It's driving the teachers nuts.

32:10.679 --> 32:12.680
How long before you can access it?

32:12.681 --> 32:14.014
Oh, try never.

32:14.015 --> 32:17.268
You don't crack stego
without a password.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.792
Would you take me to his office?

32:22.858 --> 32:26.193
Oh, when you find Soneji,
ask him for the password.

32:26.194 --> 32:29.468
He planted a monitoring virus
on the girl's hard drive.

32:29.489 --> 32:31.532
Every keystroke Megan hit,

32:31.533 --> 32:33.761
Soneji was recording it.

32:39.791 --> 32:41.564
Good move, Jezz.

32:42.544 --> 32:46.148
Angling for a position with
the DCPD. I like that.

32:47.007 --> 32:49.967
Dr Cross, Agent Ben Devine.

32:49.968 --> 32:53.721
Agent Devine is security
systems supervisor.

32:53.722 --> 32:55.556
Well, for now.

32:55.557 --> 32:57.159
We are going to be
thrown to the wolves

32:57.184 --> 33:00.003
as soon as they find Megan
Rose dead in a ditch.

33:00.020 --> 33:03.169
Now what makes you so sure
that's what's going to happen?

33:03.190 --> 33:06.169
Me getting fired or
the girl in a ditch?

33:07.068 --> 33:10.092
Sorry, I'm having a
pessimistic day.

33:12.741 --> 33:16.141
Tell me, Soneji, did he...

33:17.412 --> 33:21.437
Did he ever show any interest
in what you do? How you do it?

33:23.043 --> 33:24.752
The man never talked to me.

33:24.753 --> 33:26.855
I never talked to him.

33:28.381 --> 33:30.700
Well, thanks for your time.

34:09.547 --> 34:10.864
Hello.

34:13.592 --> 34:14.864
What?

34:16.471 --> 34:18.744
What do you think that is?

34:22.310 --> 34:24.754
- An empty frame.
- Mmm-hmm.

34:26.481 --> 34:28.754
Otherwise known as...

34:31.319 --> 34:33.217
A missing picture.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.978
You onto something?

35:45.393 --> 35:47.837
- A missing picture.
- Mmm-hmm.

35:49.898 --> 35:54.174
Our Mr Soneji has a
sense of humour.

35:54.194 --> 35:58.299
He didn't just kidnap a little girl,
he turned it into a game.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.012
Okay.

36:04.204 --> 36:07.103
Let's see what you
know, Mr Lindbergh.

36:19.094 --> 36:20.761
- My, my.
- What did he get?

36:20.762 --> 36:22.930
Dr Cross isn't in
cyberspace any more,

36:22.931 --> 36:25.534
you're at a live site looking
through a video camera.

36:25.558 --> 36:28.036
Those arrows down there move it.

36:33.108 --> 36:35.552
Where are we?

36:35.568 --> 36:38.612
I would guess we're
in Soneji's home.

36:38.613 --> 36:41.842
Now we're supposed to
find out where that is.

36:43.410 --> 36:44.785
<i>Oliver McArthur's office.</i>

36:44.786 --> 36:47.955
Yeah, it's me. Hold on.

36:47.956 --> 36:49.899
How about the files?

37:01.094 --> 37:02.469
There.

37:02.470 --> 37:03.591
- On the wall.
- There's a...

37:03.596 --> 37:06.415
Can you zoom in there?

37:06.433 --> 37:08.251
Yeah.

37:08.268 --> 37:09.415
Jonathan...

37:09.436 --> 37:10.753
- "M"...
- "E".

37:12.814 --> 37:14.064
- Hold on. Hold on.
- "L"?

37:14.065 --> 37:16.259
You can't move that around,
can you? It's stationary.

37:16.276 --> 37:17.423
Go back.

37:17.444 --> 37:19.592
No, there's something somewhere
else. I'll guarantee it.

37:19.612 --> 37:20.738
- Right there.
- There.

37:20.739 --> 37:22.762
- What?
- You can zoom.

37:22.782 --> 37:23.929
Focus. There.

37:23.950 --> 37:25.267
Bingo.

37:25.285 --> 37:27.103
- M-E-R...
- Mere?

37:27.120 --> 37:29.329
Mercusio.

37:29.330 --> 37:32.916
M-E-R-C-U-S-I-O.

37:32.917 --> 37:36.253
- 14-32... 35.
- 35.

37:36.254 --> 37:37.421
- Granville.
- Granville.

37:37.422 --> 37:38.614
Gary Soneji is also known as

37:38.631 --> 37:42.426
Mercusio, Jonathan,
1435 Granville Street.

37:42.427 --> 37:44.120
Well done, Alex.

37:51.478 --> 37:53.020
In! In!

37:53.021 --> 37:55.089
Cover up. Zoom in! Left!

37:55.982 --> 37:57.459
Eyes open!

37:58.693 --> 38:00.045
There.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.064
Not until we get the go-ahead.

38:31.518 --> 38:33.086
Turn it out to the roof.

38:44.697 --> 38:46.845
Yeah, he's still dusting.

39:14.686 --> 39:17.539
His surveillance was
better than ours.

39:18.773 --> 39:21.376
He's been at this for years.

39:26.114 --> 39:29.218
Imagine the patience.

39:29.242 --> 39:30.889
The dedication.

39:33.288 --> 39:35.516
You sound like an admirer.

39:38.251 --> 39:39.728
Well, he's...

39:41.087 --> 39:42.985
He's like a spider.

39:46.593 --> 39:48.991
And I happen to like spiders.

39:52.640 --> 39:54.742
He's got an elaborate
setup, here, boss.

39:54.767 --> 39:57.416
You want to see how he
stayed clean at school?

39:59.606 --> 40:03.150
It laminates a plastic
veneer over your hands.

40:03.151 --> 40:04.844
Look at this.

40:07.614 --> 40:11.685
Foam rubber. Looks like he was
wearing prosthetic appliances.

40:12.827 --> 40:14.161
<i>I understand the Secret Service</i>

40:14.162 --> 40:15.329
<i>are being cautious tonight.</i>

40:15.330 --> 40:18.248
<i>Th ere is speculation that a
full investigation is underway</i>

40:18.249 --> 40:20.918
<i>into how Gary Soneji was
able to kidnap a student</i>

40:20.919 --> 40:22.961
<i>from right under their cameras.</i>

40:22.962 --> 40:25.190
<i>Yes, Kevin. One of the
Secret Service agents...</i>

40:45.818 --> 40:48.362
Evening. What's the problem?

40:48.363 --> 40:51.031
Help! Help me!

40:51.032 --> 40:54.386
<i>You've got a Rule 21
problem, no running lights.</i>

40:55.787 --> 40:59.373
Again? I just replaced
the fuses yesterday.

40:59.374 --> 41:02.209
Help! Help!

41:02.210 --> 41:05.712
<i>Sir, no running lights. You're
going to have to follow us in.</i>

41:05.713 --> 41:08.657
Help! Please, help me!

41:09.092 --> 41:13.618
Well, let me see what I can do with
the fuse box. Hold on. Hold on.

41:16.307 --> 41:18.100
I'm in here, help me!

41:18.101 --> 41:20.579
<i>I've been kidnapped, help!</i>

41:21.980 --> 41:23.127
Help!

41:33.324 --> 41:34.892
How's that?

41:38.121 --> 41:40.144
Thanks a lot, fellas.

41:42.750 --> 41:44.584
Help!

41:44.585 --> 41:46.608
Help me, please!

41:57.974 --> 42:00.452
Help me, please!

42:01.853 --> 42:03.455
Help me!

42:10.820 --> 42:13.488
"...and before the hood
was pulled over his head,

42:13.489 --> 42:16.283
"he bragged to his executioner,

42:16.284 --> 42:18.869
"'They think that when I die,

42:18.870 --> 42:21.204
"'the case will die.

42:21.205 --> 42:24.583
"'They think it will be
like a book I close.

42:24.584 --> 42:26.376
"'But the book,

42:26.377 --> 42:28.730
"'it will never close."'

42:29.589 --> 42:34.115
Soneji was quoting the final words
of Richard Bruno Hauptmann.

42:37.138 --> 42:39.556
I'm sorry, I don't follow.

42:39.557 --> 42:43.602
1932. The infant son
of Charles Lindbergh,

42:43.603 --> 42:46.897
America's greatest
hero, was kidnapped.

42:46.898 --> 42:49.066
When Bruno Hauptmann was arrested,

42:49.067 --> 42:52.569
what followed became known as
"The Crime of the Century."

42:52.570 --> 42:56.239
I believe that Soneji wants
to do the same thing.

42:56.240 --> 42:59.493
You think we're dealing
with a copycat?

42:59.494 --> 43:01.411
Something like that.

43:01.412 --> 43:02.889
Dr Cross.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.235
What does he want from you?

43:11.589 --> 43:13.548
He's brought me in

43:13.549 --> 43:17.010
and left this trail because
he wants me to make sure

43:17.011 --> 43:19.489
that he's properly appreciated.

43:20.848 --> 43:23.667
And in order for him
to achieve this,

43:26.270 --> 43:27.938
he has to kill Megan?

43:27.939 --> 43:31.691
No, no. Not necessarily.

43:31.692 --> 43:34.653
The death of the Lindbergh
baby was accidental.

43:34.654 --> 43:38.031
Nevertheless, it's critical
that we pull his strings.

43:38.032 --> 43:39.950
The more we make him
a living legend,

43:39.951 --> 43:42.369
the more likely he is
to keep Megan alive.

43:42.370 --> 43:43.995
Dr Cross, you've been
brought into this case,

43:43.996 --> 43:45.789
what can you tell us
about Gary Soneji?

43:45.790 --> 43:49.501
I can tell you that Soneji
is very determined,

43:49.502 --> 43:51.545
<i>obviously highly capable</i>

43:51.546 --> 43:54.381
<i>and we consider him a
serious adversary.</i>

43:54.382 --> 43:55.799
<i>What about Megan Rose?</i>

43:55.800 --> 43:58.844
<i>Megan Rose is Gary Soneji's ace.</i>

43:58.845 --> 44:01.789
<i>As long as he has
her, he's in control.</i>

44:14.527 --> 44:17.237
<i>Sir, would you assign as
many agents to this case</i>

44:17.238 --> 44:19.406
<i>if she wasn't a Senator's daughter?</i>

44:19.407 --> 44:25.105
<i>The size of our task force is a reflection
of who Gary Soneji is, not Megan Rose.</i>

44:25.872 --> 44:28.081
Mr Soneji?

44:28.082 --> 44:30.834
<i>You can parse the
words if you'd like.</i>

44:30.835 --> 44:32.107
Hello.

44:32.545 --> 44:34.588
I need to go to the bathroom.

44:34.589 --> 44:36.131
All right. Be right there.

44:36.132 --> 44:37.484
<i>No, not at this time.</i>

45:35.316 --> 45:36.463
Come on.

45:44.158 --> 45:45.555
Come on.

46:03.386 --> 46:04.533
Hey!

46:12.270 --> 46:13.542
Help!

46:16.107 --> 46:18.335
Please, help!

46:20.069 --> 46:21.861
Help!

46:21.862 --> 46:24.385
Please, help!

46:33.582 --> 46:36.167
Help!

46:36.168 --> 46:38.646
Help me, please!

46:40.131 --> 46:41.448
Help!

46:43.217 --> 46:44.534
Help!

46:46.095 --> 46:47.572
Help me!

46:47.805 --> 46:50.890
Help, please!

46:50.891 --> 46:52.559
Please, help me!

46:52.560 --> 46:54.394
I'm coming!

46:54.395 --> 46:55.838
Hold on!

46:57.440 --> 46:58.898
Help! Help me!

46:58.899 --> 47:00.296
Hold on!

47:07.533 --> 47:08.850
No!

47:09.160 --> 47:10.728
No! Please!

47:16.042 --> 47:18.168
Please!

47:18.169 --> 47:20.128
Please!

47:20.129 --> 47:22.652
No! Help me! Please!

47:23.716 --> 47:25.284
No! Please!

47:28.804 --> 47:31.532
Here. Here.

47:31.766 --> 47:34.851
This'll keep you warm.
There you go.

47:34.852 --> 47:38.021
Megan, you promised me you
were going to behave yourself.

47:38.022 --> 47:41.547
Because of you, what you've
done, that man is dead.

47:43.486 --> 47:46.613
Now, promise me...

47:46.614 --> 47:50.344
Promise me you're going to
be a good little girl, okay?

47:51.827 --> 47:54.225
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."

47:55.998 --> 47:57.941
Say, "Yes, Mr Soneji."

47:58.834 --> 48:02.212
Yes, Mr Soneji.

48:02.213 --> 48:03.530
Okay.

48:06.133 --> 48:08.827
Now let's go have that cup of tea.

48:44.588 --> 48:47.090
I'd say eight hours.
About 9:00 a.m.

48:47.091 --> 48:50.844
Slugs are large calibre.
Shots hit him here, here.

48:50.845 --> 48:53.513
Kill shot tapped him,
crown of the head.

48:53.514 --> 48:56.433
This here is Thomas
Mathias, he found all this.

48:56.434 --> 48:57.911
This way.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.470
She's not in the water, Jezzie.

49:33.471 --> 49:35.847
Soneji still has her.

49:35.848 --> 49:38.808
- There is no way of knowing that.
- Well, think about it.

49:38.809 --> 49:40.393
Megan is precious cargo.

49:40.394 --> 49:43.563
Soneji is not going to let some
twist of fate bring her harm.

49:43.564 --> 49:44.881
Right?

49:47.985 --> 49:50.133
But why Megan? Why her?

49:56.327 --> 49:57.770
Come on.

49:58.871 --> 50:02.521
- Where are you going?
- Back to the city. We'll talk in the car.

50:05.628 --> 50:07.730
You asked, "Why Megan?"

50:08.506 --> 50:11.799
And that's the question we should have
been asking right from the start.

50:11.800 --> 50:14.278
Why Megan?

50:17.598 --> 50:19.792
Who is Senator Hank Rose?

50:21.477 --> 50:23.625
- He's...
- Nobody.

50:25.397 --> 50:27.148
Most people don't
even know who he is.

50:27.149 --> 50:31.069
Never heard of him. Couldn't
pick him out of a line-up.

50:31.070 --> 50:34.155
This case is front-page news now,
where will it be in two months?

50:34.156 --> 50:36.366
A Year?

50:36.367 --> 50:38.515
Oblivion. Know why?

50:39.954 --> 50:44.275
Because Senator Hank Rose
is no Charles Lindbergh.

50:45.876 --> 50:48.946
- Well, okay, then, who is?
- Ah...

50:50.297 --> 50:52.946
There is the troublesome question.

50:53.259 --> 50:54.781
Come on, Jezzie.

50:54.802 --> 50:58.156
Two years, five days
a week. You know Soneji.

50:58.514 --> 51:01.242
Who's a bigger fish
than Megan Rose?

52:10.044 --> 52:12.128
Dr Cross, Agent Flannigan,

52:12.129 --> 52:15.965
we appreciate your concern,
but Dimitri is fine,

52:15.966 --> 52:19.427
and our security services are
most capable of protecting

52:19.428 --> 52:22.031
the son of the Russian president.

52:23.265 --> 52:25.933
Can we at least talk to him?

52:25.934 --> 52:28.978
Nothing would please us
more than to be of help.

52:28.979 --> 52:33.316
But speaking to Dimitri right
now would be inappropriate.

52:33.317 --> 52:35.340
Thanks for your time.

53:06.183 --> 53:07.266
What?

53:07.267 --> 53:09.602
Well, McArthur is drag
netting the bay, right?

53:09.603 --> 53:12.105
And, I mean, he's not
really missing us,

53:12.106 --> 53:15.525
so I was thinking maybe we
could just stick around and,

53:15.526 --> 53:18.220
you know, scope out
the place a bit.

53:20.781 --> 53:23.054
Agent Flannigan, are you...

53:24.702 --> 53:28.287
Are you suggesting a stakeout here?

53:28.288 --> 53:30.707
Yeah, you know, stale
coffee, some doughnuts.

53:30.708 --> 53:34.904
No, no, no. That's a first-class
stakeout, Agent Flannigan.

53:34.920 --> 53:37.547
What you are talking about
here would be no frills.

53:37.548 --> 53:41.403
You'd only get to think about
stale coffee and doughnuts.

53:42.594 --> 53:45.243
Well, I can handle it if you can.

54:42.488 --> 54:45.531
I get the feeling
you've done this a lot.

54:45.532 --> 54:47.116
Oh, yeah.

54:47.117 --> 54:49.060
Every chance I get.

54:51.205 --> 54:54.980
Especially when it's cold and wet.

55:07.054 --> 55:08.304
No parking here.

55:08.305 --> 55:10.723
We are on the clock, Officer.

55:10.724 --> 55:12.225
Everything okay?

55:12.226 --> 55:14.454
Everything is all right.

55:37.584 --> 55:39.502
What's the problem?

55:52.099 --> 55:54.702
Go ahead, Jezzie.

55:54.726 --> 55:55.998
What?

55:59.773 --> 56:01.774
Have one.

56:01.775 --> 56:03.218
Thank you.

57:14.181 --> 57:16.249
Alex, that's Dimitri.

57:54.221 --> 57:58.497
Jezzie, it's him. It's him!

58:19.997 --> 58:21.189
Soneji!

58:21.748 --> 58:23.020
Hold it right there!

58:29.256 --> 58:32.030
Jezzie, shoot the tyres!

58:33.927 --> 58:35.119
Jezzie!

58:51.194 --> 58:52.546
Jezzie!

58:58.368 --> 59:01.017
Police! Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

59:21.433 --> 59:22.830
Jezzie!

59:28.315 --> 59:31.984
Jezzie, you're going to
get Megan back, right?

59:31.985 --> 59:34.653
Yes, we are. I promise.

59:34.654 --> 59:36.927
Use this to get Mr Soneji.

59:38.992 --> 59:40.910
I will.

59:40.911 --> 59:42.388
Thank you.

59:44.915 --> 59:47.666
You talk to Hal, I want you
to bring him up to speed.

59:47.667 --> 59:48.834
Well done, guys.

59:48.835 --> 59:52.004
Avert an international crisis
and paint Soneji into a corner.

59:52.005 --> 59:53.339
Not bad for a night's work.

59:53.340 --> 59:56.008
Incoming, Soneji ditched the
patrol car near Reno Park.

59:56.009 --> 59:58.612
Hijacked a tan Sierra. Put one
bullet in the driver's head.

59:58.637 --> 01:00:00.596
Last seen heading toward Route 50.

01:00:00.597 --> 01:00:04.100
Annapolis. I knew it. 75,000 boats.

01:00:04.101 --> 01:00:07.186
- Other marinas?
- We're here, dead fisherman here.

01:00:07.187 --> 01:00:10.439
These, all the marinas, all locked
down, patrol boats in each of them.

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.963
All right, listen up.
We got to move fast.

01:00:12.984 --> 01:00:15.861
Roadblock Route 50 and triple the
surveillance in the harbours.

01:00:15.862 --> 01:00:18.966
I want two choppers on the
pad in five minutes. Let's go.

01:01:08.707 --> 01:01:10.184
Son of a bitch.

01:01:34.900 --> 01:01:36.547
What's wrong?

01:01:39.946 --> 01:01:42.424
I blew it, that's what's wrong.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:49.330
I had a shot right before
he hit the hydrant.

01:01:49.331 --> 01:01:53.732
But instead of pulling the trigger,
I was thinking. I was thinking!

01:01:53.752 --> 01:01:56.462
Yeah, you were thinking of the
possibility of your shot going astray

01:01:56.463 --> 01:01:58.631
and blowing Soneji's head
off, in which case...

01:01:58.632 --> 01:02:00.674
We would never find
Megan. I know that.

01:02:00.675 --> 01:02:03.619
Well, then, don't beat
yourself up for being prudent.

01:02:03.637 --> 01:02:07.116
Alex, you don't get it. I was trained
to shoot first and think later,

01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.017
- and I...
- Jezzie, for heaven's sake.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:12.291
If you hadn't convinced
me to stay there,

01:02:12.312 --> 01:02:14.355
Soneji would have two
victims instead of one.

01:02:14.356 --> 01:02:17.460
Plus we'd have an international
incident on our hands. You did good.

01:02:17.484 --> 01:02:20.588
- Yes, but still...
- You did good.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:25.866
- Anything?
- No, not yet.

01:02:25.867 --> 01:02:28.535
We're sitting on the area.

01:02:28.536 --> 01:02:30.934
Chief, Soneji's on the phone.

01:02:43.051 --> 01:02:45.324
- Soneji?
<i>- Detective Cross?</i>

01:02:45.345 --> 01:02:47.994
<i>I want to explain how
the agenda's changed.</i>

01:02:48.014 --> 01:02:50.349
<i>You're going to bring me
$10 million in diamonds.</i>

01:02:50.350 --> 01:02:55.896
<i>Point five carat, colour D, clarity
SI2 in a thermos in nine hours.</i>

01:02:55.897 --> 01:03:00.503
<i>If the stones are rigged, laser
tagged, irradiated, the girl dies.</i>

01:03:00.527 --> 01:03:02.470
<i>Does that penetrate?</i>

01:03:02.862 --> 01:03:04.259
It does.

01:03:04.406 --> 01:03:07.680
<i>I'll call back. 4:00 p.m. sharp.</i>

01:03:10.036 --> 01:03:11.479
He beat the trace.

01:03:11.496 --> 01:03:15.351
The clock's ticking, people, let's
move this downtown. Let's go.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.737
<i>Dr Cross?</i>

01:03:44.738 --> 01:03:46.055
I'm here.

01:03:46.740 --> 01:03:49.684
<i>The Watergate. 20 minutes.</i>

01:03:49.909 --> 01:03:52.683
<i>There's a package for Mr Antwerp.</i>

01:03:53.121 --> 01:03:55.394
Okay, people, let's move.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:00.235
Don't lose me, kiddo.

01:04:00.253 --> 01:04:02.230
You won't even see me.

01:04:42.462 --> 01:04:44.630
I'm on police business.
Keep it here, please.

01:04:44.631 --> 01:04:45.778
Eddy, this way.

01:04:55.850 --> 01:04:57.122
Hi, how are you?

01:04:57.143 --> 01:04:58.811
Do you have a package
for Mr Antwerp?

01:04:58.812 --> 01:05:00.209
Yes.

01:05:04.859 --> 01:05:06.302
Yes, sir.

01:05:11.157 --> 01:05:13.100
Over there. That one.

01:05:24.212 --> 01:05:25.379
Cross.

01:05:25.380 --> 01:05:27.381
<i>Leave the phone. Leave the car.</i>

01:05:27.382 --> 01:05:31.487
<i>Pennsylvania and 6th. The fountain.
Fourteen minutes. Run.</i>

01:05:31.636 --> 01:05:32.783
Thanks.

01:05:34.013 --> 01:05:35.389
Mac, you there?

01:05:35.390 --> 01:05:37.333
- Alex.
<i>- He made me ditch the car.</i>

01:05:37.350 --> 01:05:39.999
<i>Looks like it's a running game.
I'm on my way to</i>

01:05:40.019 --> 01:05:42.838
6th and Pennsylvania.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:46.464
I'm left and behind you, Alex.

01:06:08.882 --> 01:06:11.155
Bearing onto Pennsylvania.

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:22.704
- Cross.
<i>- 12th and Madison.</i>

01:06:22.729 --> 01:06:25.548
<i>Twelve minutes will
get you there. Go.</i>

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:33.010
Unit 3, loop on 23rd Street. Unit 6,
take K Street and double back.

01:06:41.122 --> 01:06:43.520
You've got four units on top, Alex.

01:06:52.467 --> 01:06:53.592
Cross.

01:06:53.593 --> 01:06:57.038
<i>Four minutes. Union
Station. Main entrance.</i>

01:06:58.765 --> 01:06:59.912
Jezzie.

01:06:59.933 --> 01:07:02.309
<i>Union Station, main entrance.</i>

01:07:04.771 --> 01:07:07.545
It's rush hour. He's
drawing him into a crowd.

01:07:34.342 --> 01:07:36.410
Hey! Hey!

01:07:37.136 --> 01:07:38.738
Don't answer that!

01:07:38.763 --> 01:07:40.138
I think it's for me.

01:07:40.139 --> 01:07:41.456
Cross.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:04.146
- Cross.
<i>- Keep this phone. Take the Metro.</i>

01:08:04.163 --> 01:08:07.267
<i>Platform A. You got
two minutes. Go.</i>

01:08:13.715 --> 01:08:16.944
Jezzie, Metro,
downstairs, platform A.

01:08:34.027 --> 01:08:35.174
Cross.

01:08:35.194 --> 01:08:37.796
<i>Go to the centre of the platform.</i>

01:09:13.774 --> 01:09:15.502
<i>Track 15. Go.</i>

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:40.943
<i>Go to the first car.</i>

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.385
<i>You there yet?</i>

01:10:06.160 --> 01:10:07.494
Yeah, I'm there.

01:10:07.495 --> 01:10:10.269
<i>Go to the left side.
Open the window.</i>

01:10:10.832 --> 01:10:12.290
These windows don't open.

01:10:12.291 --> 01:10:15.565
<i>You're smart, Detective.
Improvise. Quickly.</i>

01:10:18.131 --> 01:10:20.173
Police officer, everybody down!

01:10:20.174 --> 01:10:21.947
Get down, everybody down.

01:10:21.968 --> 01:10:23.911
Come on, out of the way.

01:10:28.015 --> 01:10:31.790
<i>We're ready. All right. Now, throw.</i>

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:54.647
We can neither confirm nor
deny that Gary Soneji

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:57.252
was involved in the incident
on the MTA train this morning.

01:10:57.253 --> 01:10:58.962
We've heard rumours
that a ransom was paid.

01:10:58.963 --> 01:11:00.046
Can you comment on this?

01:11:00.047 --> 01:11:01.319
I can't comment on any of that.

01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.883
What about Megan Rose?

01:11:02.884 --> 01:11:05.594
<i>I'm not going to go into
any details at this time.</i>

01:11:05.595 --> 01:11:08.323
<i>What do we know about
Soneji's state of mind?</i>

01:11:08.347 --> 01:11:11.326
I'm not going to comment
on his mental stability.

01:11:11.350 --> 01:11:13.435
You can draw your own conclusions.

01:11:13.436 --> 01:11:17.898
Now, Senator Rose has agreed to
make a statement, but he's not...

01:11:17.899 --> 01:11:19.065
- What's up?
- ...going to answer any questions.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:22.340
The file on Soneji, is it
still on your kitchen table?

01:11:22.361 --> 01:11:23.570
Yeah, why?

01:11:23.571 --> 01:11:25.344
I'm going to have
another look at it.

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:27.866
This business about
the diamonds, money,

01:11:27.867 --> 01:11:29.310
I didn't see it coming.

01:11:29.410 --> 01:11:32.454
<i>And the feelings of
absolute helplessness.</i>

01:11:32.455 --> 01:11:38.187
<i>I am grateful that the FBI is here
with the objective expertise required</i>

01:11:38.211 --> 01:11:42.157
<i>to find out where my daughter
is. Secondly, I now...</i>

01:11:48.888 --> 01:11:51.366
This is worse than killing time.

01:11:52.058 --> 01:11:54.206
Yeah, but you'd be
amazed at how often

01:11:54.227 --> 01:11:58.048
the small, neglected things
become the most important.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:02.502
I've just got the feeling
we are missing something.

01:12:03.736 --> 01:12:06.446
Maybe I'm in the
wrong line of work.

01:12:06.447 --> 01:12:09.892
Maybe I should take on
something less challenging.

01:12:09.909 --> 01:12:12.228
You do what you are, Jezzie.

01:12:12.245 --> 01:12:14.598
You mean, "You are what you do."

01:12:15.122 --> 01:12:18.442
No, I mean, you do what you are.

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.355
You're born with a gift.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:26.572
If not that, then you get good
at something along the way.

01:12:27.260 --> 01:12:30.910
And what you're good at,
you don't take for granted.

01:12:30.930 --> 01:12:32.873
You don't betray it.

01:12:35.476 --> 01:12:38.645
What if you do betray your gift?

01:12:38.646 --> 01:12:41.147
Then you betray yourself.

01:12:41.148 --> 01:12:42.941
That's a sad thing.

01:12:49.991 --> 01:12:51.809
- Who is it?
- Police.

01:13:02.128 --> 01:13:03.730
Gary Soneji.

01:13:04.297 --> 01:13:05.740
Hi, Alex.

01:13:08.509 --> 01:13:11.469
Now, right hand,
thumb and forefinger.

01:13:11.470 --> 01:13:13.447
Just give me the gun.

01:13:17.184 --> 01:13:20.629
Alex, you can't shoot me.
You'll never find Megan.

01:13:36.203 --> 01:13:37.930
Sit down, Alex.

01:13:46.672 --> 01:13:49.466
I'm a little concerned,
Alex. I'm a little...

01:13:49.467 --> 01:13:51.194
I'm a little worried that you...

01:13:52.219 --> 01:13:54.721
You don't really care to
understand me any more.

01:13:54.722 --> 01:13:57.166
That you won't paint
an accurate portrait.

01:13:57.183 --> 01:13:59.832
And I need you to convince
me that I'm wrong.

01:13:59.852 --> 01:14:03.396
Well, in order to do that, we're going
to have to talk about Megan Rose.

01:14:03.397 --> 01:14:05.357
No. No, no bargaining, Alex.

01:14:05.358 --> 01:14:08.068
No cheap interrogation techniques.

01:14:08.069 --> 01:14:10.672
It's transparent and it's clumsy.

01:14:11.405 --> 01:14:13.678
This is between me and you.

01:14:14.367 --> 01:14:16.409
I want you to see.

01:14:16.410 --> 01:14:21.892
I want you to look inside here and
tell me what the fuck you see.

01:14:23.876 --> 01:14:25.978
I'm a gift to you, Alex.

01:14:27.088 --> 01:14:29.190
I'm a gift to you.

01:14:29.882 --> 01:14:34.704
And you are beyond pitiful if
you cannot understand that.

01:14:36.555 --> 01:14:38.999
I'm living proof that a mind...

01:14:40.893 --> 01:14:43.337
The mind is a terrible thing.

01:14:53.739 --> 01:14:55.740
I see you've got your
sense of humour back.

01:14:55.741 --> 01:14:56.888
Yeah.

01:14:59.078 --> 01:15:02.728
I wondered what happened to
it during the ransom drop.

01:15:05.793 --> 01:15:07.566
The ransom drop.

01:15:08.587 --> 01:15:11.190
That was a well-earned $12 million.

01:15:11.632 --> 01:15:13.359
Twelve million.

01:15:16.470 --> 01:15:19.414
Senator Rose says he
can pull strings.

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:23.143
Says he can fix it so you keep
the $12 million and walk.

01:15:23.144 --> 01:15:26.146
All you have to do
is return the child.

01:15:26.147 --> 01:15:27.874
Where is Megan?

01:15:29.108 --> 01:15:30.755
Where's Megan?

01:15:31.652 --> 01:15:33.379
Where's Megan?

01:15:33.821 --> 01:15:36.925
Where's Megan? Where's
Megan? Where's Megan?

01:15:38.117 --> 01:15:41.494
She's trapped on my boat,
Alex, isn't that right?

01:15:41.495 --> 01:15:43.496
Or maybe she's stuck in
a warehouse somewhere

01:15:43.497 --> 01:15:45.457
or floating in a river.

01:15:45.458 --> 01:15:48.732
Swinging from the end
of a rope. Buried alive.

01:15:54.467 --> 01:15:55.944
I envy her.

01:15:59.805 --> 01:16:02.624
What would life have been
like with parents like that?

01:16:02.641 --> 01:16:06.245
Come on, Gary. Blaming your
parents for what you are?

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.794
I'm not blaming them, Alex.

01:16:10.566 --> 01:16:13.010
They've been punished already.

01:16:14.403 --> 01:16:15.675
Oh?

01:16:18.491 --> 01:16:21.640
I burned down the house
while they slept.

01:16:26.415 --> 01:16:28.517
I was 15 years old.

01:16:30.377 --> 01:16:32.605
Was it what you expected?

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:36.985
Not really. It was
a new experience.

01:16:37.009 --> 01:16:38.486
What, killing?

01:16:38.511 --> 01:16:39.658
No.

01:16:40.846 --> 01:16:43.119
Being in the newspapers.

01:16:46.018 --> 01:16:49.771
So, in your opinion, Doctor,

01:16:49.772 --> 01:16:56.175
were my actions triggered
by nature or nurture?

01:16:57.863 --> 01:17:01.741
If you want me to
be brutally honest,

01:17:01.742 --> 01:17:05.813
I think you just have a morbid
desire to burn in hell.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.521
We're done for today.

01:17:16.215 --> 01:17:18.317
I'm taking her with me.

01:17:24.265 --> 01:17:26.367
You're not taking her anywhere.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:28.101
I'll send her back to you.

01:17:28.102 --> 01:17:30.937
You just tell me which
piece you want first.

01:17:34.400 --> 01:17:36.844
Oh, shit!

01:17:38.445 --> 01:17:39.842
Damn it!

01:17:41.115 --> 01:17:42.512
Alex!

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:56.609
What...

01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:00.363
What have you done?

01:18:02.428 --> 01:18:04.747
What have you done?

01:18:08.809 --> 01:18:11.913
Residents of this normally quiet
suburb are still in shock

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:13.980
as news of the shooting
of Gary Soneji,

01:18:13.981 --> 01:18:17.426
who is America's most wanted man,
filter through their community.

01:18:17.443 --> 01:18:20.153
Apparently Soneji attempted
to confront or even harm

01:18:20.154 --> 01:18:23.031
members of the kidnapping
taskforce hunting him.

01:18:23.032 --> 01:18:27.228
So he came after Jezzie
as payback for Dimitri.

01:18:28.829 --> 01:18:31.273
Ostensibly, yeah.

01:18:31.290 --> 01:18:33.166
That's how you want it on record?

01:18:33.167 --> 01:18:34.814
Yeah, for now.

01:18:41.133 --> 01:18:42.826
Here they come.

01:18:51.143 --> 01:18:55.794
Dr Cross, tell me you have at least
an idea of where my little girl is.

01:18:55.814 --> 01:18:57.962
I'm sorry, sir, I can't.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.318
You kill the one man
that has the answers,

01:19:00.319 --> 01:19:02.695
and you're telling me
you haven't a clue?

01:19:02.696 --> 01:19:04.197
Not one clue?

01:19:04.198 --> 01:19:05.990
The man walked in the fucking room

01:19:05.991 --> 01:19:08.264
- and you shot him!
- Senator.

01:19:09.703 --> 01:19:12.247
Standing in his shoes, I'd
have done the same thing, sir.

01:19:12.248 --> 01:19:14.476
Well, that's your job, not his.

01:19:14.500 --> 01:19:16.542
He's supposed to
find my little girl,

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:19.613
not shoot the man who
knows where she is.

01:19:19.713 --> 01:19:21.190
Senator.

01:19:28.055 --> 01:19:29.782
It's not over.

01:19:32.351 --> 01:19:35.295
The book is not closed.

01:19:56.542 --> 01:19:57.814
Alex.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:03.214
Thank you for saving my life.

01:20:03.215 --> 01:20:04.817
Goodbye, Jezz.

01:20:12.725 --> 01:20:15.044
You want to hear
something funny, Mac?

01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:17.379
Sure, cheer me up.

01:20:19.481 --> 01:20:22.835
I congratulated Soneji
on scoring $12 million.

01:20:23.569 --> 01:20:25.546
You mean $10 million.

01:20:27.614 --> 01:20:29.011
Exactly.

01:20:29.908 --> 01:20:32.761
He had no idea what
I was talking about.

01:20:58.270 --> 01:21:00.964
I know you. You work at my school.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:04.756
Eat your food, Megan.

01:21:51.865 --> 01:21:54.093
Alex, where is this going?

01:22:01.333 --> 01:22:04.502
We've been through these tapes
backwards and forwards.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:07.732
I can't see how this is
helping us find Megan.

01:22:10.008 --> 01:22:12.361
Do you know what I see, Mac?

01:22:12.678 --> 01:22:16.055
Someone was onto Soneji long
before we ever heard of him.

01:22:16.056 --> 01:22:18.182
Look at this. What do you see?

01:22:18.183 --> 01:22:21.102
Agent Devine hauling ass
out to the front gate.

01:22:21.103 --> 01:22:24.981
Mac, he could have shut this whole
place down from right there.

01:22:24.982 --> 01:22:27.835
Now you want to tell
me why he didn't?

01:22:31.697 --> 01:22:32.923
Good God!

01:22:33.490 --> 01:22:35.366
Devine was in on it with him.

01:22:35.367 --> 01:22:38.119
Then when Soneji hit the embassy,
he pulled a double-cross.

01:22:38.120 --> 01:22:39.787
He ran his own ransom.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:40.980
No.

01:22:41.790 --> 01:22:43.708
Soneji was a loner.

01:22:43.709 --> 01:22:46.733
An accomplice would
have been beneath him.

01:22:47.045 --> 01:22:49.714
I'll tell you what happened.

01:22:49.715 --> 01:22:51.738
Soneji was hoodwinked,

01:22:53.385 --> 01:22:55.078
and so were we.

01:22:55.888 --> 01:22:59.307
<i>Details are still emerging,
but this much is clear,</i>

01:22:59.308 --> 01:23:02.935
<i>the manhunt that began over a
week ago in the nation's capital</i>

01:23:02.936 --> 01:23:05.146
<i>came to a violent end
late yesterday...</i>

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:08.000
<i>with the death of kidnapper,
Gary Soneji. In this...</i>

01:23:40.933 --> 01:23:42.455
Don't move.

01:23:42.768 --> 01:23:46.020
Turn around, hands on
the wall, feet apart.

01:23:46.021 --> 01:23:47.980
Hi, Jezz, where did you come from?

01:23:47.981 --> 01:23:50.733
You know something, Devine?
You're pretty stupid.

01:23:50.734 --> 01:23:52.276
Your car in the driveway,

01:23:52.277 --> 01:23:56.197
the TV so loud you wouldn't be
able to hear a SWAT team come in.

01:23:56.198 --> 01:23:58.596
- What are you doing?
- Shut up!

01:24:15.133 --> 01:24:16.780
Where's Megan?

01:24:17.594 --> 01:24:18.970
She's in the barn.

01:24:18.971 --> 01:24:20.304
She was so doped up,

01:24:20.305 --> 01:24:22.640
I don't think she even knew
I took her off the boat.

01:24:22.641 --> 01:24:24.475
She's still alive?

01:24:24.476 --> 01:24:28.020
You were supposed to dump her in the
river after you got the diamonds.

01:24:28.021 --> 01:24:29.897
Yeah, well...

01:24:29.898 --> 01:24:34.235
Maybe killing a kid is something
I'm not prepared to do on my own.

01:24:34.236 --> 01:24:37.029
Anyway, today, tomorrow, it's still
going to look like Soneji killed her.

01:24:37.030 --> 01:24:39.282
She can't die after
Soneji, you idiot!

01:24:39.283 --> 01:24:41.826
It doesn't make any
difference, you know why?

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:44.680
They're never going
to find the body.

01:24:48.166 --> 01:24:51.586
Okay. I'll go do it now,
will that make you happy?

01:24:51.587 --> 01:24:53.234
Yeah, it would.

01:24:53.380 --> 01:24:54.697
Wait.

01:25:00.512 --> 01:25:02.205
Can I see them?

01:25:17.487 --> 01:25:19.614
Hey, do you realise that
we spent an entire year

01:25:19.615 --> 01:25:22.059
following Soneji's every move?

01:25:23.243 --> 01:25:25.437
I think we deserve these.

01:25:30.584 --> 01:25:32.835
That beats the hell out of a
Secret Service pension, huh?

01:25:32.836 --> 01:25:34.438
Hmm.

01:25:35.047 --> 01:25:37.195
Profiling the profiler.

01:25:38.133 --> 01:25:40.885
Kidnap from the kidnapper,
that's brilliant.

01:25:40.886 --> 01:25:43.034
You are a genius, Jezz.

01:25:44.264 --> 01:25:48.369
Genius has nothing to do with
it, I'm just good at what I do.

01:25:50.312 --> 01:25:53.856
Well, it didn't hurt that everyone
else involved was a complete half-wit.

01:25:53.857 --> 01:25:56.317
You think Alex Cross is a half-wit?

01:25:56.318 --> 01:26:00.218
You really believe that he
shot Soneji to save my life?

01:26:00.989 --> 01:26:02.114
Cross pulled the trigger

01:26:02.115 --> 01:26:05.515
because he knew Soneji
didn't have Megan any more.

01:26:06.578 --> 01:26:08.579
What are you saying?

01:26:08.580 --> 01:26:11.874
I'm saying that sooner or later
he's going to figure it out.

01:26:11.875 --> 01:26:15.104
He already knows Soneji
didn't run the ransom.

01:26:16.088 --> 01:26:18.611
He is onto us already, isn't he?

01:26:18.882 --> 01:26:20.905
No, he's not onto us.

01:26:22.761 --> 01:26:24.488
But I think he's onto you.

01:28:09.910 --> 01:28:11.577
<i>It's Turkish.</i>

01:28:11.578 --> 01:28:14.038
<i>My daddy won it in a game of poker.</i>

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:17.234
<i>It's about as much as I
know about my father.</i>

01:29:59.936 --> 01:30:01.128
Megan?

01:30:02.355 --> 01:30:04.207
Megan, it's me, honey.

01:30:04.608 --> 01:30:05.800
Jezzie?

01:30:06.902 --> 01:30:10.279
Jezzie! Jezzie,
I'm in here! Jezzie!

01:30:10.280 --> 01:30:13.240
Open up, honey. I'm gonna
take you home. It's all over.

01:30:13.241 --> 01:30:16.015
Yeah, sure, just hold on a second!

01:30:22.667 --> 01:30:24.019
Jezzie?

01:30:24.878 --> 01:30:26.446
Yeah, honey?

01:30:26.671 --> 01:30:29.194
What happened to that other guy?

01:30:31.176 --> 01:30:33.028
He's dead, Megan.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.159
You're safe now.

01:30:35.305 --> 01:30:36.748
Open up.

01:30:37.641 --> 01:30:38.993
Jezzie?

01:30:39.142 --> 01:30:40.710
Yeah, honey?

01:30:41.186 --> 01:30:43.459
Why isn't there
anyone else with you?

01:30:48.109 --> 01:30:49.944
Megan, it's me.

01:30:49.945 --> 01:30:52.924
Now don't be scared of me.
Open the door.

01:30:57.452 --> 01:31:00.788
Megan, I'm going to ask you one
more time to open the door.

01:31:00.789 --> 01:31:02.983
Right now! Open the door!

01:31:03.875 --> 01:31:05.852
Megan, open the door, honey!

01:31:06.336 --> 01:31:08.689
Listen to me! Open the door!

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.715
Megan, open the fucking door!

01:31:11.716 --> 01:31:13.910
Open it! Bitch!

01:31:20.308 --> 01:31:21.660
Stop it!

01:31:23.645 --> 01:31:25.088
Stop it!

01:32:35.592 --> 01:32:37.444
Very clever, Megan.

01:32:52.984 --> 01:32:54.256
Come on.

01:34:06.683 --> 01:34:08.080
Jezzie?

01:34:12.147 --> 01:34:13.624
It's over.

01:34:14.566 --> 01:34:16.168
Drop the gun.

01:34:20.405 --> 01:34:21.722
Alex.

01:34:25.243 --> 01:34:26.660
How did you, um...

01:34:26.661 --> 01:34:28.809
Aces and Eights, Jezzie.

01:34:29.372 --> 01:34:32.021
Plus your timing was a little off.

01:34:32.792 --> 01:34:34.769
I watched the tapes.

01:34:35.545 --> 01:34:39.423
You and Devine could have
stopped Soneji at the school.

01:34:39.424 --> 01:34:42.593
Just like you could have stopped
him at the Russian embassy.

01:34:42.594 --> 01:34:44.845
But you had a different agenda.

01:34:44.846 --> 01:34:47.040
You know something, Alex?

01:34:48.016 --> 01:34:51.916
When you said you do what
you are, you were right.

01:34:53.354 --> 01:34:55.206
I'm living proof.

01:34:57.317 --> 01:34:59.511
Put the gun down, Jezzie.

01:35:06.159 --> 01:35:08.637
Would you kill another partner?

01:35:09.787 --> 01:35:11.889
You're not my partner.

01:36:26.614 --> 01:36:28.216
You all right?

01:36:31.369 --> 01:36:33.972
You are a very brave girl, Megan.

01:36:35.123 --> 01:36:36.691
Who are you?

01:36:38.209 --> 01:36:39.982
I'm a policeman.

01:36:43.131 --> 01:36:45.154
My name is Alex Cross.

01:36:46.551 --> 01:36:48.949
I'm a friend of your parents.

01:36:52.140 --> 01:36:54.334
Can you take me to them?

01:36:55.893 --> 01:36:58.746
Nothing would give
me greater pleasure.

01:37:02.358 --> 01:37:03.926
Could you...

01:37:04.652 --> 01:37:06.095
Thanks.
