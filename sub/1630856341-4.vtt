You disappeared for two full days.
Where have you been?

01:44.875 --> 01:46.541
Exploring the city.

01:46.541 --> 01:49.000
Mrs. Polignac has also been away
for the past two days.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.541
Coincidence, perhaps?

01:50.541 --> 01:52.125
You were with her, right?

01:52.916 --> 01:54.625
That's why you got here so late.

01:55.125 --> 01:57.000
You told me you wouldn't put us
in any danger.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.500
But you did it anyway.

No.

02:11.166 --> 02:13.875
I wasn't expecting to steal the jewels
for another two nights.

I'll take care of the cameras

Let me know when you're ready,

[Damián] How can you call it love
when everything is a lie?

06:06.041 --> 06:08.333
Your name. Your phone number.

06:08.333 --> 06:11.208
And in two days,
you'll disappear, and she'll have nothing.

06:11.708 --> 06:13.750
I would never refuse
a single moment of love

06:13.750 --> 06:15.875
just because I knew
that the relationship would end.

06:15.875 --> 06:18.666
And when it ends,
I will sink into an abyss of pain.

06:18.666 --> 06:21.208
But until then, I will be alive.

06:22.166 --> 06:23.666

You're just a selfish bastard.
A sick egomaniac.

06:29.000 --> 06:31.375
Is this relationship worth
all the pain it'll cause?

06:31.375 --> 06:32.958
Of course it is.

06:35.791 --> 06:38.125
Five minutes with Camille has more passion

06:38.125 --> 06:41.583
than in 20 years
of that masquerade you call a marriage.

06:41.583 --> 06:46.125

30:26.333 --> 30:28.000
Hang on. [scoffs]

30:29.250 --> 30:30.625
Let me get this straight.

30:30.625 --> 30:33.541
Are you telling me that,
after successfully stealing millions,

30:33.541 --> 30:36.500
we are the only two people
who are not going to celebrate?

30:37.291 --> 30:38.750
Yes. You're absolutely right.

30:44.750 --> 30:46.750
[music fades]

30:49.208 --> 30:50.541
And who are you?

30:52.125 --> 30:53.958
I'm just curious to find out.

30:55.375 --> 30:56.291
[Roi sighs]

30:57.041 --> 30:58.791
Like, what is that glove hiding?

30:58.791 --> 31:00.500
<i>Driving</i> glove.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.083
Oops. Sorry.

31:02.583 --> 31:04.541
And what are these driving gloves hiding?

31:04.541 --> 31:06.583
A past life as a child thug?

31:07.208 --> 31:10.041
A tough guy from skid row?

31:10.041 --> 31:11.291
[both chuckle]

31:11.291 --> 31:12.791
[tender piano music playing]

31:12.791 --> 31:16.125
These fists must've seen some action.

31:16.625 --> 31:17.625
Bad boy.

31:18.208 --> 31:19.208
[chuckles]

31:20.125 --> 31:21.333
And this tattoo?

31:22.625 --> 31:23.583
Let me see.

31:24.208 --> 31:27.125
A wild buck with twisted horns.

31:28.625 --> 31:33.125
And what has happened to these hands
that would scar them for life?

31:37.416 --> 31:38.708
[inhales sharply]

31:40.583 --> 31:41.875
[sighs]

31:43.291 --> 31:44.500
Let's see.

31:45.875 --> 31:47.583
What's this peeking out?

31:48.541 --> 31:49.958
A tentacle.

31:52.250 --> 31:53.083
Oh!

31:53.083 --> 31:54.333
An octopus!

31:54.333 --> 31:56.208
[both laugh]

31:56.208 --> 31:58.791
Do you have
an entire aquarium on your back?

32:01.916 --> 32:05.000
Or are those your ex-pets
that... [makes choking sound]

32:08.541 --> 32:09.875
Let's try something.

32:10.583 --> 32:12.041
Have you seen <i>The Purge</i>?

32:12.041 --> 32:16.666
Well, basically, in the movie, one day,
every year, you can do whatever you want.

32:16.666 --> 32:18.250
- Great film.
- Great film.

32:18.250 --> 32:19.541
[chuckles]

32:19.541 --> 32:21.250
Tonight could be that night.

32:21.250 --> 32:24.500
To unleash the slumbering beast
inside you.

32:24.500 --> 32:27.916
And tomorrow, you can go back
to playing nice, sweet Cinderella.

32:27.916 --> 32:30.583
The self-restrained little boy,
Cameron's babysitter,

32:30.583 --> 32:32.708
Berlin's obedient lieutenant.

32:33.791 --> 32:34.833
[Roi exhales]

32:36.041 --> 32:37.208
You know what?

32:37.208 --> 32:38.666
What?

32:38.666 --> 32:41.416
Maybe I'm tired of being
Berlin's obedient bitch.

32:42.333 --> 32:45.375
So tonight, it's time
to pump up the voltage.

32:45.375 --> 32:47.708
And how does one pump up the voltage?

32:47.708 --> 32:49.708
It depends on your level of craziness.

32:49.708 --> 32:52.250
Tonight, I'd say I'm at... [sighs]

32:53.791 --> 32:54.833
...nine out of ten.

32:55.708 --> 32:58.083
Well, I'm at 10.7 and increasing.

32:58.083 --> 32:59.041
[chuckles]

32:59.041 --> 33:00.500
Time to go, Lieutenant.

33:01.000 --> 33:02.166
[Roi chuckles]

33:03.875 --> 33:06.041
Get changed. But don't change the hair.

33:07.083 --> 33:09.166
Tonight, we fly under the radar.

33:37.000 --> 33:38.625
- [Keila] Psst! Here.
- [Bruce] Okay.

33:43.708 --> 33:45.625
- [tablet chimes]
- I don't believe it.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.166
- What?
- It's not connected.

33:47.166 --> 33:50.083
- What do you mean, not connected?
- You could've done it on your own.

33:50.083 --> 33:51.375
[Bruce] On my own?

33:51.375 --> 33:53.958
And who would delete my passport
from the hard drive?

34:09.458 --> 34:10.833
That's the computer.

34:10.833 --> 34:12.541
That's where they took my info.

34:18.541 --> 34:21.416
[PC tower humming, beeps]

34:22.250 --> 34:23.625
It's password-protected.

[tense music fades]

34:53.708 --> 34:54.791
Psst! Keila!

34:54.791 --> 34:58.083
Keila! Downstairs, there's a bunch
of guys playing poker.

35:00.916 --> 35:03.875
- Give me a minute, guys.
- [man 1] The show must go on.

35:03.875 --> 35:06.916
[man 2] You think you can leave
with your money just like that?

35:06.916 --> 35:08.166
Just you wait.

35:10.958 --> 35:11.958
[guard sighs]

35:14.875 --> 35:16.416
[man 3] Quick. Check his cards.

35:17.875 --> 35:20.000
Where the hell did he get all these aces?

35:20.000 --> 35:22.083
[tense music swells]

35:30.708 --> 35:31.875
Who the hell are you?

35:33.125 --> 35:34.541
Amélie. The new girl.

35:35.541 --> 35:37.916
I came in early
to get started on the invoicing.

35:37.916 --> 35:40.000
[calculator keys clacking]

35:51.000 --> 35:52.125
And Michelle?

35:52.958 --> 35:53.833
Where is she?

35:55.291 --> 35:56.250
Um, she's...

35:57.708 --> 35:58.916
she's injured.

36:16.125 --> 36:17.333
Doesn't surprise me.

36:18.000 --> 36:22.041
I'm tellin' you, that woman,
she won't stop until she can lift a bus.

36:22.041 --> 36:23.375
[laughs nervously]

36:23.375 --> 36:25.625
[chuckles]

36:30.041 --> 36:32.875
[tense music continues]

36:42.666 --> 36:44.125
Could you make me a cup of coffee?

36:44.708 --> 36:46.166
I'm a little nervous.

36:50.375 --> 36:51.833
I'm... I'm kinda stressing out.

36:56.583 --> 36:58.208
[sighs] Sure.

36:58.708 --> 37:00.291
I'll get you a cup of coffee.

37:00.791 --> 37:02.916
- My pleasure.
- Thanks. [sighs]

37:04.666 --> 37:06.416
- [clears throat]
- Don't worry so much.

37:06.416 --> 37:08.750
Everyone goes through first-day jitters.

37:08.750 --> 37:10.208
[chuckles]

37:12.291 --> 37:13.916
Hey, boys.

37:13.916 --> 37:16.125
Let me introduce you to Amélie.

37:16.125 --> 37:17.583
She's the new girl.

37:17.583 --> 37:19.041
In accounting.

37:19.541 --> 37:21.666
<i>Salut</i>. Hello, Amélie.

37:21.666 --> 37:22.875
Hello.

37:23.375 --> 37:26.000
- Anyone want a beer?
- Nah, thanks.

37:28.208 --> 37:29.833
[static crackles on radio]

37:32.291 --> 37:33.458
Want one?

37:33.458 --> 37:34.666
No, thanks. I'm good.

37:41.625 --> 37:42.791
You came in early?

37:44.333 --> 37:45.291
Huh?

37:46.083 --> 37:47.500
[louder] You're in early.

37:49.750 --> 37:50.583
Yeah.

37:51.458 --> 37:52.708
Yeah, you're right.

37:53.250 --> 37:56.291
They told me there was
a problem with the invoices. [chuckles]

38:00.958 --> 38:03.416
- [coffee maker whirs]
- Anyone for roast chicken?

38:03.416 --> 38:05.125
I'd love some. Your wife's a great cook.

38:05.125 --> 38:07.958
- [man 2] I don't eat chicken, thanks.
- [guard] Why not?

38:07.958 --> 38:09.125
You a vegan?

38:09.125 --> 38:10.625
Nah, I'm not vegan.

38:12.625 --> 38:15.541
I saw a documentary.
Do you know they're being sued?

38:15.541 --> 38:19.208
They use syringes and inject this shit
into them, and then two weeks later,

38:19.208 --> 38:21.208
they already weigh two kilos.

38:21.208 --> 38:22.791
And then we eat that shit.

38:23.291 --> 38:24.791
And we become obese.

38:54.541 --> 38:56.041
It's, uh, some kind of bug.

38:56.041 --> 38:57.208
Well, you know,

38:57.208 --> 38:59.833
I learned a technique
that debugs everything.

38:59.833 --> 39:01.250
And it works every time.

39:01.875 --> 39:03.958
You unplug it and plug it back in.

39:03.958 --> 39:05.250
And it works.

39:05.875 --> 39:08.583
It's, uh... infallible.

Check this.
