- JAMAL: But seriously, y'all, I mean,

08:54.883 --> 08:56.550
this is 'Keem back at his best.

08:56.551 --> 08:57.995
- You know what I'm saying?
- COOKIE: Yeah, that is great,

08:58.019 --> 09:00.220
considering Hakeem hasn't done a video

09:00.221 --> 09:01.732
- in what... like, two years?
- Right.

09:01.756 --> 09:03.467
- But he didn't miss a beat.
- COOKIE: No.

09:03.491 --> 09:05.959
But you want to know what he
has not done even longer?

09:05.960 --> 09:08.428
Boy ain't been on tour.

09:08.429 --> 09:11.108
- Well, touring is expensive.
- JAMAL: It can be, but why can't we take

09:11.132 --> 09:12.734
some of the Panama money? We
put that towards a tour...

09:12.758 --> 09:15.969
COOKIE: Ah, ah! Boy. Can't nobody know

09:15.970 --> 09:17.871
where we got our cash infusion from.

09:17.872 --> 09:20.540
- Shut your head.
- My point is

09:20.542 --> 09:23.043
we need a tour,
so why not put together

09:23.044 --> 09:25.596
a Hakeem and Jamal Lyon
Resurrection Tour?

09:25.597 --> 09:26.577
Right.

09:26.578 --> 09:28.359
It gets people's minds back
on what's most important.

09:28.360 --> 09:30.550
And what's most important
at Empire? Music.

09:30.552 --> 09:31.996
- COOKIE: That's right.
- GISELLE: What you're talking about

09:32.020 --> 09:33.587
- is Lyon music.
- LUCIOUS: No. No.

09:33.588 --> 09:35.889
We're talking about the music
that built Empire.

09:35.890 --> 09:37.568
- That's right.
- LUCIOUS: My music built it.

09:37.592 --> 09:38.769
It makes my sense that my sons

09:38.793 --> 09:40.260
should resurrect it with theirs.

09:40.261 --> 09:43.463
Empire is no longer your
personal playground, Lucious.

09:43.464 --> 09:47.367
A decision this large
requires my support.

09:47.368 --> 09:49.113
Well, well, I'm sorry,
you forget that I built

09:49.137 --> 09:50.971
this so-called "playground."

09:50.972 --> 09:55.409
I know where the swing set is,
the slide, and the sandbox.

10:05.453 --> 10:07.621
(EXHALES SHARPLY) Okay.

10:07.622 --> 10:10.157
We'll see about that.

10:13.094 --> 10:14.561
Did that just happen?

10:14.562 --> 10:16.596
We moving on it or not?

10:16.598 --> 10:18.098
You damn right we're doing it.

We're just gonna wait
until we put a pin

10:19.500 --> 10:21.635

right there.

10:21.636 --> 10:23.937
No, no, no, no, no.

10:23.938 --> 10:25.973
Let me deal with Miss Giselle.

10:25.974 --> 10:28.542
- JAMAL: Oh, Mom.
- No. no.

10:28.543 --> 10:30.644
We are professionals, remember?

10:30.645 --> 10:32.646

10:32.647 --> 10:35.349
Nothing happened

<i>And you're making a conspiracy
out of a coincidence.</i>

10:38.386 --> 10:40.954
Do you think all that I have is
some kind of hip-hop hoedown

10:40.955 --> 10:42.266
to connect you to Damon and Lucious?

10:42.290 --> 10:43.801
Besides me being their lawyer. Hello!

10:43.825 --> 10:44.825
- Oh, my God...
- Which means any communications

10:44.826 --> 10:46.226

10:46.227 --> 10:49.396
falls under the protection
of attorney-client privilege.

10:49.397 --> 10:51.631
Privilege is pierced when the attorney

10:51.633 --> 10:53.433
is engaged in an ongoing crime,
Counselor.

10:53.434 --> 10:56.370
- And you have no evidence of that!
- Sit down.

Sit down.

that somebody's watching you?

11:13.721 --> 11:16.123
Well, you should be vibrating

11:16.124 --> 11:18.325

11:18.326 --> 11:20.304
'cause the Feds have been
watching your every move.

11:20.328 --> 11:23.063
So if I were you, Thirsty,

11:23.064 --> 11:24.598
I'd get comfortable.

11:24.599 --> 11:27.200
'Cause you're not going anywhere.

11:31.364 --> 11:34.331
The only thing that is gonna
save you, Thirsty, is the truth.

11:40.839 --> 11:42.273
Okay.

11:44.876 --> 11:46.310
Okay.

11:47.612 --> 11:49.146
Maybe there's more to this.

Please.

you guys have been starting
at the Platinum Party.

12:06.465 --> 12:09.800
But this story really begins

12:09.801 --> 12:12.303
in another place at another time.

12:12.304 --> 12:14.605
It's, um...

12:14.606 --> 12:17.608
the story of a-of a guy
and a girl. Vera.

12:19.044 --> 12:21.779
It's a love story.

12:21.780 --> 12:23.480
I'm here to drop off

12:23.482 --> 12:26.150
- a plea bargain for ADA Smith.
- Mm-hmm.

12:26.151 --> 12:27.818
Put it on the pile.

12:28.820 --> 12:31.555
A man's life hangs
in the balance, sweetie.

12:31.556 --> 12:33.657
I'd really like to hand it
to him personally.

12:38.430 --> 12:40.497
It's a bad day for a plea bargain.

12:40.499 --> 12:43.233
DA's in his feelings over his ex.

12:43.235 --> 12:44.568
THIRSTY: Oh.

12:44.569 --> 12:46.103
What do you suggest?

12:46.104 --> 12:48.172
Come back Thursday after 2:00.

12:48.173 --> 12:50.641
Right after his happy ending massage.

Mm-hmm.

12:58.416 --> 13:00.250
Looks cute, huh?

13:00.252 --> 13:02.519
Hey, you know what? I'll catch
up with you downstairs.

13:09.761 --> 13:11.762
Um...

13:11.763 --> 13:14.064
how about I, uh, b-buy you some lunch?

13:14.065 --> 13:17.668
I'm not interested in lunch.

13:17.669 --> 13:19.770
Oh.

13:21.239 --> 13:23.941
But you can buy me dinner.

Vera... who, by the way,

13:33.464 --> 13:35.298
sounds like
a make-believe girlfriend...

13:35.299 --> 13:37.634
have to do with Damon and Lucious?

13:37.635 --> 13:38.679
Look, you want me
to tell you the truth,

13:38.703 --> 13:39.936
then you got to be patient.

13:39.937 --> 13:41.705
All right? I'm getting there.

<i>GISELLE: It's unbelievable.</i>

13:44.542 --> 13:46.676
- Yeah. Today would be great.
- (KNOCKING)

13:46.677 --> 13:48.878
Let me call you back.

13:48.880 --> 13:50.480
- Hey.
- Hi, Cookie.

13:50.481 --> 13:53.783
Look, um, I know we're
equal partners and everything,

13:53.784 --> 13:56.286
but, uh, Lucious' face
is still on that logo.

13:56.287 --> 13:58.121
And I'm not saying it's right,

13:58.122 --> 14:00.167
but he's gonna be strongheaded,
and that's just the way it is.

14:00.191 --> 14:02.258
That's the way it is.
That sounds like an excuse,

14:02.260 --> 14:04.561
not an explanation.

14:04.562 --> 14:07.197
What does your 20% think?

14:07.198 --> 14:08.999
Is it handcuffed to his?

14:10.968 --> 14:13.036
(CLICKS TONGUE) Okay.

14:13.037 --> 14:16.373
Hakeem is in no way
ready to headline yet.

14:16.374 --> 14:19.075
The road can be really rough on you.

14:19.076 --> 14:22.379
- So we agree. The tour's off.
- I didn't say that.

14:22.380 --> 14:24.247
I said my baby's not ready
to headline.

14:24.248 --> 14:27.117
Look, what do you think about Empire

14:27.118 --> 14:31.087
launching a national tour featuring...

14:31.088 --> 14:34.257
all of our artists... Empire and LFM?

14:34.258 --> 14:36.326
The risk is too high.

14:36.327 --> 14:38.328
Come on, man. Go hard or go home.

14:38.329 --> 14:42.232
See, Cookie, you can say that
because you have a family

14:42.233 --> 14:44.968
and a husband to back you up.

14:44.969 --> 14:47.037
Empire is all I have.

14:47.038 --> 14:49.572
It's everything we got. Everything!

14:49.573 --> 14:51.875
I called Kelly Patel.

14:51.876 --> 14:53.810
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

14:53.811 --> 14:55.578
So, you went running to tell teacher

14:55.579 --> 14:58.114
because you knew
you wouldn't get your way.

14:58.115 --> 15:00.650
The parent company
has a 40% stake in Empire.

15:00.651 --> 15:03.153
Kelly has a right
to know what's going on.

15:03.154 --> 15:04.988
He'll be here later today.

15:04.989 --> 15:06.456
Oh, really?

15:06.457 --> 15:09.359
So did you snitch about Panama, too?

15:09.360 --> 15:11.861
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY) Of course not.

15:11.862 --> 15:14.631
He doesn't need to know
all our business.

15:14.632 --> 15:17.500
(SHORT CHUCKLE)

15:17.501 --> 15:19.602
We need this tour.

15:22.840 --> 15:25.241
So were you ever gonna
tell me about this tour?

15:25.242 --> 15:27.243
Yeah, I know.
Between this and Hakeem's video

15:27.244 --> 15:29.212
and this whole Treasure/Tiana thing,

15:29.213 --> 15:31.558
it's like the universe don't
even want me to miss Kai, so...

15:31.582 --> 15:35.452
Who is Kai?
Stop talking about him. God.

15:35.453 --> 15:38.788
I'm not hearing any music. Why's that?

15:38.789 --> 15:40.290
I-I tried, man.

15:40.291 --> 15:41.825
Uh-uh.

- Y'all, what's good?
- TIANA: Jamal,

15:44.161 --> 15:46.506
- I really tried, but I can't do this.
- Oh, no, no, no, no.

15:46.530 --> 15:48.542
- She is completely unprofessional.
- Unprofessional?

15:48.566 --> 15:50.010
- Girl, what is you talking...?
- Not getting any work done.

- All day.
- BECKY: For real?

15:54.572 --> 15:55.572
Isn't your baby crying somewhere?

15:55.573 --> 15:56.817
Talk about my baby one more time.

15:56.841 --> 15:57.841
Talk about my baby,
and you gonna have to

15:57.842 --> 15:59.209
get you a security guard.

15:59.210 --> 16:00.687
Why don't she got
the baby monitor in here?

16:00.711 --> 16:02.122
- Where is the baby?
- ...a mother, I will drag you.

16:02.146 --> 16:03.457
Girl, keep talking.
I'm unprofessional?

16:03.481 --> 16:05.081
- Oh, word?
- Yeah.

16:05.082 --> 16:06.460
- We cannot work together.
- You just got here.

16:06.484 --> 16:08.061
You doing a lot of this.
You need to do this.

16:08.085 --> 16:09.963
- I hear your baby crying. Go
check on your baby. - Okay.

16:09.987 --> 16:11.498
- Jamal, please come take out the trash.
- Really? Jamal.

16:11.522 --> 16:13.133
- (SIGHS)
- And don't talk about my baby no more.

16:13.157 --> 16:15.102
- Jamal, I can't do this.
- You talk a lot for...

16:15.126 --> 16:16.693
(VOLUME LOWERS)

16:18.195 --> 16:20.263
Thank you.

16:22.366 --> 16:24.968
I don't know. I mean,
after a couple of dates,

16:24.969 --> 16:27.036
we hit it off.

16:27.038 --> 16:30.039
Uh, Vera quit her job
at the DA's office.

16:30.041 --> 16:31.941
Before I knew it,
she was working for me.

16:31.942 --> 16:34.577
And it was magical.
I mean, she was beautiful.

16:34.578 --> 16:37.480
You're giving me cramps.
Please, get to the point.

16:37.481 --> 16:41.284
Vera w-was fascinated by celebrities.

16:41.285 --> 16:44.487
All right, she was obsessed
with this Platinum Party,

16:44.488 --> 16:45.855
so I had to finagle

16:45.856 --> 16:47.624
a couple of invites for us.
That night,

16:47.625 --> 16:50.093
that's when I ran into Mr. Lyon.

16:50.094 --> 16:52.195
I've seen enough. Let's go home.

16:52.196 --> 16:54.164
- Oh, after-party, huh?
- Yeah. (GIGGLES)

16:54.165 --> 16:55.865

16:55.866 --> 16:57.901
- What's up, man?
- Hey. -Hi.

16:57.902 --> 16:59.235
- One second, Mama.
- Hey.

16:59.236 --> 17:00.236
What's up, boss?

17:00.237 --> 17:01.938
You ready to take the Empire or what?

17:01.939 --> 17:04.574
It's more like the opposite right now.

17:04.575 --> 17:06.509
What's up? What you need?

17:06.510 --> 17:08.444
How much I owe you right now?

17:08.445 --> 17:10.146
Oh, we ain't gonna talk about that.

17:10.146 --> 17:12.025
It's a party atmosphere.
Come on, I know where you live.

17:12.049 --> 17:14.217
I don't like owing people.

17:14.218 --> 17:17.153
And until things get right...

17:17.154 --> 17:20.490
I should take a leave of absence
for a little while.

17:20.491 --> 17:23.092
- Just till things get right.
- Say no more, <i>mon ami.</i> I get it.

17:23.094 --> 17:25.828
You call me when you need me.
Enough said.

17:25.829 --> 17:27.266
I'm sorry, man.

17:27.267 --> 17:28.425
It's okay. Nothing to
be sorry about, man.

17:28.425 --> 17:30.400
- When it's right...
- It's right.

17:30.401 --> 17:33.002
- Sorry.
- Nice jacket, though.

17:33.003 --> 17:35.605
I'm rubbing off on you.

17:35.606 --> 17:37.607
Baby, are you okay?

17:37.608 --> 17:39.876
Yes. Everything's good.

17:39.877 --> 17:41.254
It's all good. Come on, let's go home.

17:41.278 --> 17:42.912
No, no, no, no. We should stay.

17:42.913 --> 17:44.414
Let's not forget why we're here.

17:44.415 --> 17:46.796
I quit my job to help you
build your practice.

17:46.797 --> 17:47.644
Yes.

17:47.645 --> 17:49.096
And, babe, I believe in
you, but we have no money

17:49.120 --> 17:50.497
- coming in.
- We have no money coming in.

17:50.521 --> 17:51.754
- No.
- This is true.

17:51.755 --> 17:53.590
Then let's work the crowd
and do what we do.

17:53.591 --> 17:54.991
- Okay.
- Find the money.

17:54.992 --> 17:57.493
- I'm sorry, baby. I'm sorry.
- No, it's okay.

17:57.495 --> 17:59.495
- All right.
- (LAUGHS)

17:59.497 --> 18:01.141
- I'm gonna get some drinks, okay?
- Yeah, okay.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.865
Okay.

18:02.867 --> 18:04.300
Hey, how you doing?

18:04.301 --> 18:05.679
Can I get a couple of tequila shots?

18:05.703 --> 18:08.438
There you go.

18:08.439 --> 18:10.016
There's a lot of beautiful women
here tonight, huh?

18:10.040 --> 18:11.774
Ah. I hadn't noticed.

18:11.775 --> 18:13.710
Thirsty Rawlings, right?

18:13.711 --> 18:15.378
I'm sorry, do we know each other?

18:15.379 --> 18:17.380
No. I'm Damon Cross.

18:17.381 --> 18:19.582
But, you know, I'm looking
for a personal attorney.

18:19.583 --> 18:21.050
Somebody who can be discreet,

18:21.051 --> 18:22.819
you know what I'm saying, resourceful.

18:22.820 --> 18:24.954
And-and I heard you do good work
with the Lyons.

18:24.955 --> 18:27.423
- Ah. You know the Lyons, huh?
- Not really.

18:27.424 --> 18:29.158
I ran into Cookie a few weeks ago.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.194
I really love how she handles
her business,

18:31.195 --> 18:32.695
and I assume that

18:32.696 --> 18:35.131
that extends
down to the family attorney.

18:35.132 --> 18:36.633
It does.

18:36.634 --> 18:38.536
Maybe I can squeeze you
in sometime next week?

18:38.560 --> 18:39.392
Really?

18:39.393 --> 18:41.271
That sounds... Oh, man, thank you.

18:41.272 --> 18:43.373
<i>- Salud.
- Salud.</i>

18:44.375 --> 18:47.243
- Mm.
- Yeah, I'll be in touch.

18:47.244 --> 18:48.778
♪

18:48.779 --> 18:50.880
Let me get two more.

18:50.881 --> 18:52.215
Thanks.

18:52.216 --> 18:54.217
- Thirsty.
- Ah.

18:54.218 --> 18:56.085
You see that? When one door closes,

18:56.086 --> 18:57.620
- another one opens.
- No.

18:57.621 --> 18:59.956
There are no coincidences.
Lucious lets you go,

18:59.957 --> 19:03.459
and then all of a sudden
Damon Cross wants to hire you?

19:03.460 --> 19:05.194
Wh-What do you know about Damon Cross?

19:05.196 --> 19:07.664
They whisper about him
in the DA's office,

19:07.665 --> 19:09.399
but they can never pin anything on him

19:09.400 --> 19:12.435
because he's too good
at whatever he does.

19:12.436 --> 19:15.004
Sounds like he gonna
keep me busy. (LAUGHS)

19:15.005 --> 19:17.507
I'm serious, Thirsty. He's dangerous.

19:19.109 --> 19:21.878
Look, babe, we just started, okay?

19:21.879 --> 19:23.290
- I don't want to lose you.
- Hey, hey.

19:23.314 --> 19:24.858
How do... how do you go to losing me?

19:24.882 --> 19:26.716
You're not gonna lose me.
All right, look,

19:26.717 --> 19:29.852
if I can handle Lucious Lyon,
I can handle Damon Cross.

19:33.824 --> 19:35.191
Ah.

19:41.755 --> 19:43.689
- Should I close this?
- Please.

19:45.291 --> 19:47.292
- How are you?
- Good.

19:47.293 --> 19:48.794
Please, sit.

19:48.795 --> 19:50.896
(CLEARS THROAT)

Your CT scan results...

19:54.234 --> 19:57.002

19:57.003 --> 19:59.938
And yours looks to be
particularly tricky.

19:59.939 --> 20:01.874
Now, that doesn't mean
that we're giving up.

20:01.875 --> 20:03.442
We've had some success

20:03.443 --> 20:05.077

20:22.529 --> 20:24.630
Andre?

20:33.606 --> 20:35.545
It is so nice to finally meet you.

20:35.546 --> 20:37.147
- You have 15 minutes.

20:37.148 --> 20:39.215
Oh, honey, it'll only take five.

20:39.216 --> 20:42.585
Your Instagram Live posts
are deeply moving,

20:42.586 --> 20:45.588
and your ability to resonate
with people is a gift.

20:45.589 --> 20:48.424
- Thank you.
- My mother follows you.

20:48.426 --> 20:50.693
My hairdresser? Obsessed with you.

20:50.694 --> 20:53.963
A major television network
president told me she's a fan.

20:53.964 --> 20:56.332
Sign with me, you'll be
in her office on Monday.

20:56.333 --> 20:58.501
Okay, look, I'm flattered, all right?

20:58.502 --> 21:01.871
But, um, I'm busy
rebuilding my empire.

21:01.872 --> 21:04.674
You could be your own brand
with my help.

21:04.675 --> 21:06.809
Brand? What, like a toothpaste?

21:06.811 --> 21:09.746
(LAUGHS) Hey, honey, try Oprah.

21:09.747 --> 21:11.681
Or Beyoncé.

21:11.682 --> 21:14.918
(LAUGHS) Child, look, I'm busy.

21:14.919 --> 21:17.030

21:17.054 --> 21:19.189
on <i>The View</i> for Whoopi

21:19.190 --> 21:20.456
when she goes on vacation?

21:20.458 --> 21:23.960
I'd say you're blowing smoke
up my ass.

21:23.961 --> 21:25.461
That network president I mentioned?

21:25.463 --> 21:26.996
She already approved it.

21:26.997 --> 21:30.667
Cookie Lyon,
I'm gonna change your life.

21:34.271 --> 21:36.272
Tee, I swear I'm-a need
blood pressure medicine

21:36.273 --> 21:38.039
by the time I'm done
working with y'all.

21:38.063 --> 21:39.249
It's not my fault.

21:39.250 --> 21:40.821
She keeps stepping all over my vocals.

21:40.845 --> 21:42.579
There would not be a problem

21:42.580 --> 21:44.324
if you would just sing
your part correctly.

21:44.348 --> 21:46.293
I'm singing my part correctly.
You're being extra.

21:46.317 --> 21:48.184
- Hey, hey.
- TREASURE: Really?

21:48.185 --> 21:50.186
What is this beef really about?

21:50.187 --> 21:52.365
I'll tell you what it's about.
You stole my song last time,

21:52.389 --> 21:54.591
and now she wants to turn around
and steal my duet.

21:54.592 --> 21:56.726
No, that's not what happened.

21:56.727 --> 21:57.904
Jeff Kingsley played me the track,

21:57.928 --> 21:58.972
and I thought it was fire.

21:58.996 --> 22:00.230
And then he told me

22:00.231 --> 22:01.541
it was Tiana's,
and if I really wanted it,

22:01.565 --> 22:04.067
I had to fight for it.
So what am I supposed to do?

22:04.068 --> 22:06.703
I'm the new girl.

22:09.106 --> 22:11.808
Eddie used to play
all these same games.

22:11.809 --> 22:14.544
Always comparing me to somebody else.

22:14.545 --> 22:17.313
"Christina's vocals
are bigger than yours."

22:17.314 --> 22:19.415
"Beyoncé's moves
are better than yours."

22:19.416 --> 22:21.985
I couldn't even make it
out of the hospital

22:21.986 --> 22:25.054
before he told me,
"Lose the baby weight."

22:25.055 --> 22:27.056
JAMAL: Mm.

22:27.057 --> 22:30.159
Damn near made me hate myself.

22:32.096 --> 22:34.964
And y'all don't even recognize
the connection here?

22:34.965 --> 22:38.234
I mean, really, you don't see
about just how you're playing

22:38.235 --> 22:39.836
right into the hands of these men?

22:39.837 --> 22:41.838
I love you, Mal, but...

22:41.839 --> 22:43.416
what makes you
any different right now?

22:43.440 --> 22:46.039
TREASURE: For real. You are
just another industry man

22:46.040 --> 22:47.111
telling two women what to do.

22:47.112 --> 22:49.345
- The same old thing.
- Okay, you know what?

22:49.346 --> 22:52.181
I-I'm gonna... I'm gonna receive that.

22:52.183 --> 22:55.318
So let's say that it's
gonna be different from now on.

22:55.319 --> 22:58.721
We got two strong,
black, female artists.

22:58.722 --> 23:02.292
These men are here
pitting y'all against each other

23:02.293 --> 23:04.961
to distract you
from what your actual power is.

23:04.962 --> 23:06.462
Y'all together.

23:06.463 --> 23:08.131
Take all of that power, man,

23:08.132 --> 23:09.799
and put it into the music.

23:09.800 --> 23:12.435
I mean, look,
I don't-I don't want to be a...

23:12.436 --> 23:14.637
an industry man
telling y'all what to do.

23:14.638 --> 23:17.040
- (LAUGHS)
- But can we try it again?

23:17.041 --> 23:19.108
Unified.

23:21.178 --> 23:23.746
- Hmm?
- Okay, okay.

23:23.747 --> 23:25.748
All right.

23:29.153 --> 23:30.586
Thank you, trinket.

23:30.588 --> 23:32.388
Oh, my... Can y'all stop with that?

23:32.389 --> 23:33.556
(LAUGHING)

23:33.557 --> 23:34.935
- You like that one, don't you?
- TREASURE: Hey. Geez.

23:34.959 --> 23:36.426
You're a professional.

23:36.427 --> 23:39.228
All right.

23:42.967 --> 23:44.500
Thank you.

23:44.501 --> 23:47.270
All right, after the party,

23:47.271 --> 23:49.672
did you ever talk
to Damon Cross again?

23:49.673 --> 23:51.708
Nah. It was just a one-off.

23:51.709 --> 23:53.343
He never called.

23:53.344 --> 23:56.746
What about Victor Horst?

23:56.747 --> 23:58.748
(CLEARS THROAT)

23:59.984 --> 24:02.218
Look, I told you
everything I know, all right?

24:02.219 --> 24:04.164
Now you're showing me pictures
of dudes at Mar-a-Iago.

24:04.188 --> 24:05.665
I can't help you with that.
All right, now,

24:05.689 --> 24:07.033
they're expecting me
back at Empire... I need

24:07.057 --> 24:09.125
- to get back to work.
- Victor... Horst.

24:11.862 --> 24:14.163
DAMON: Where we at, Victor?

24:14.164 --> 24:16.999
I converted the diamonds to euros

24:17.001 --> 24:20.103
and funneled the cash
through a charity.

24:20.104 --> 24:23.106
- Yeah, the Orphans of Rwanda Fund?
- Yeah.

24:23.107 --> 24:25.608
Nobody questions dying orphans.

24:25.609 --> 24:27.510
Well, we, uh,
promised them ten percent.

24:27.511 --> 24:30.012
I called the orphanage.
They didn't receive their cut.

24:30.014 --> 24:32.081
Why the hell would <i>you</i> talk to them?

24:32.082 --> 24:34.684
THIRSTY: It's called doing my job...

24:34.685 --> 24:36.152
- assclown.
- You don't work

24:36.153 --> 24:38.554
for Lucious Lyon anymore.

24:38.555 --> 24:41.290
You're supposed to just draw up
the transfer documents.

24:41.292 --> 24:43.359
DAMON: So, tell me, Victor,

24:43.360 --> 24:45.995
how much money actually went
to the orphans?

24:45.996 --> 24:48.431
Here's the beauty of it:
I strong-armed

24:48.432 --> 24:50.066
the orphanage director

24:50.067 --> 24:52.502
to kick us back
the entire ten million.

24:52.503 --> 24:54.470
- (LAUGHS)
- THIRSTY: Eh...

24:54.471 --> 24:56.172
I did a little research.

24:56.173 --> 24:58.875
There's only nine million
in the offshore account.

25:00.978 --> 25:02.845
I think you made a mistake.

25:02.846 --> 25:05.581
Nah, I think you made
the mistake when you...

25:05.582 --> 25:06.816
pocketed...

25:06.817 --> 25:09.719
that ten... percent!

25:09.720 --> 25:13.222
(GRUNTS) I hate liars!

25:15.592 --> 25:18.294
You send two million dollars
to that orphanage.

25:18.295 --> 25:20.229
- Two million.
- Okay.

25:20.230 --> 25:23.266
And he is right about one thing:
I ain't no Lucious Lyon.

25:23.267 --> 25:25.735
I'm a lot more dangerous.

25:27.071 --> 25:28.538
Clean him up.

25:28.539 --> 25:31.541
Get him up. Roll this up.
Get him out of here.

25:45.589 --> 25:47.123

there's no clear vision on how to fund

- this tour.
- LUCIOUS: No vision?

28:23.077 --> 28:25.379
a dozen calls from your cell to his?

28:26.981 --> 28:28.882
We have phone records.
We have correspondence.

We have checks from your account
to his company in Geneva.

29:52.834 --> 29:54.001
Yeah. Sure.

29:58.406 --> 30:00.841
I owe you an apology.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.110
What for?

30:03.111 --> 30:06.213
Making Kingsley CEO over you.

30:06.214 --> 30:09.149
If I had made the right choice
in the first place,

30:09.150 --> 30:11.852
Empire wouldn't be in this mess.

30:11.853 --> 30:16.023
Well, I appreciate you
telling me this in person.

30:18.293 --> 30:21.995
Generally, I don't-I don't
like coming to New York.

30:21.996 --> 30:25.298

kind of makes it all worth it.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.202

to see you, too...

- Lucious, I don't want

- Listen,

30:35.777 --> 30:38.111
under Kingsley's leadership,

30:38.112 --> 30:40.313
Empire betrayed the trust of its fans.

30:40.315 --> 30:41.548

30:41.549 --> 30:43.950
we owe our Empire family a debt.

30:43.952 --> 30:45.585
Let's repay it.

30:45.586 --> 30:47.154
Okay.

30:47.155 --> 30:49.689
- Okay, tell me how.
- LUCIOUS: We want to make

30:49.691 --> 30:53.026
the concert tour completely free.

30:53.027 --> 30:55.695
KELLY: (SCOFFS) So your answer

30:55.697 --> 30:58.198
to "Empire can't afford a tour"
is to make the tour free?

30:58.199 --> 31:01.134
- Yes.
- KELLY: That's heartfelt,

31:01.135 --> 31:04.171
but also reckless
and likely to bankrupt you.

31:04.172 --> 31:06.073

31:06.074 --> 31:07.574

31:11.045 --> 31:13.413
this is exactly
the kind of grand mea culpa

31:13.414 --> 31:14.881
that just might work.

31:14.882 --> 31:16.083
Hear me out.

31:16.084 --> 31:17.984
The free publicity
will offset the costs.

31:17.986 --> 31:21.021
The tour will drive up
the record sales.

31:21.022 --> 31:23.657
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but I think I'm gonna side

31:23.658 --> 31:25.992
with Lucious and Cookie on this one.

31:25.994 --> 31:28.829
- Yes! Smart woman.

- Yeah.

32:00.269 --> 32:02.837

32:02.838 --> 32:05.540

32:08.077 --> 32:09.978

try to tell me nothing, man.

with that robbery.

cleaned him out,

34:06.502 --> 34:08.469
took him for everything that night.

37:58.400 --> 38:00.568
Oh.

38:00.569 --> 38:02.670
At best.

38:32.375 --> 38:34.476
Thank you.

38:38.180 --> 38:40.849
AGENT: The things a guy'll
do to impress a girl, huh?

38:40.850 --> 38:43.028
His story pans out, but
that doesn't make it the truth.

38:43.052 --> 38:44.819
AGENT: Think we'll ever see him again?

38:44.820 --> 38:47.222
Probably. In a body bag.

38:47.223 --> 38:50.225
Get me everything we have
on the Lyon clan.

38:51.446 --> 38:53.894
I just have to find the precise crack

38:53.895 --> 38:55.730
and exert just the right amount
of pressure.

38:55.731 --> 38:57.164
Before you know it,

38:57.165 --> 38:59.467
Chicken and Waffles
will be behind bars.

39:02.904 --> 39:05.005
What?

39:15.350 --> 39:17.451
You okay, baby?

39:18.353 --> 39:20.988
Yeah.

39:20.989 --> 39:22.990
DAMON: She's fine.

39:22.991 --> 39:25.526
We was just worried about you.

39:26.928 --> 39:28.929
Okay.

39:28.930 --> 39:31.298
You were right.

39:31.299 --> 39:33.300
The Feds have been on you for a while.

39:33.301 --> 39:34.345
Okay. What'd they know?

39:34.369 --> 39:35.970
Whole lot of nothing.

39:35.971 --> 39:38.339
- Even less after I finished talking.
- Good.

39:42.110 --> 39:44.245
Now you can go.

39:44.246 --> 39:46.347
- Help me out.
- Go straight home, okay?

39:46.348 --> 39:47.882
- I'm right behind you.
- Okay.

39:47.883 --> 39:50.851
Hey. Hey, hey, where you going?

39:50.852 --> 39:52.263
Listen, I did what you asked, okay?

39:52.287 --> 39:53.888
So now we're straight. I'm out.

39:53.889 --> 39:56.257
Nah, you ain't out till I say you out.

39:57.993 --> 40:00.861
I need you to keep an even
closer eye on Lucious for me.

40:00.862 --> 40:02.897
A closer eye on Lucious...

40:02.898 --> 40:04.899
or Cookie, my man?

40:09.571 --> 40:11.672
Yeah, that's what I thought.

40:16.674 --> 40:18.813
You know, six months ago,

40:18.814 --> 40:21.549
when we were stuck in that house
without any AC,

40:21.550 --> 40:23.851
with no prospects, with...

40:23.852 --> 40:26.353
without two nickels to rub together.

40:26.354 --> 40:27.955
Now look at us, man.

40:27.956 --> 40:29.390
We're back on the throne.

40:29.391 --> 40:31.759
I mean, this was worth fighting for.

40:31.760 --> 40:33.928
Yeah, it's still the biggest risk

40:33.929 --> 40:36.063
we've ever had to take, Lucious.

40:36.064 --> 40:38.098
Why are you being
so negative right now?

40:38.100 --> 40:40.701
I'm not negative.
I-I believe in us, okay?

40:40.702 --> 40:43.204
I'm just worried. I'm-I'm scared.

40:43.205 --> 40:46.807
For Empire. I'm scared about us.

40:46.808 --> 40:50.311
You know any time we've rolled
the dice on this family,

40:50.312 --> 40:52.112
we've always come up with seven.

40:53.081 --> 40:55.015
What happened with that meeting

40:55.016 --> 40:57.218
with that agent from L.A.?

40:58.653 --> 41:01.121
- Told her I'd think about it.
- You what?

41:01.123 --> 41:03.557
Baby, you're supposed to be
focused on this right now.

41:03.558 --> 41:05.659
Look, Lucious, like most women,

41:05.660 --> 41:08.395
I know how to multitask, okay?

41:08.396 --> 41:10.064
I am working on building

41:10.065 --> 41:11.709
my brand, which is only
gonna help Empire.

41:11.733 --> 41:13.177
I thought you would know that, genius.

41:13.201 --> 41:14.702
Your brand?

41:14.703 --> 41:16.971
Yeah. My brand. That's what I said.

41:16.972 --> 41:20.074
No, it's just funny that they're
trying to make you a star

41:20.075 --> 41:23.143
when you were already born
a celestial event.

41:23.145 --> 41:24.812
Come on.

41:24.813 --> 41:26.747
Celestial event.

41:26.748 --> 41:29.817
My brand. See it now?

41:29.818 --> 41:32.286
(LUCIOUS LAUGHS)

41:38.093 --> 41:40.394
Hey.

41:40.395 --> 41:42.029
Andre.

41:43.165 --> 41:47.067
I cannot sign this, and I won't.

41:48.036 --> 41:49.247
It's for the both of you, Teri.

41:49.271 --> 41:50.738
It's for your future.

41:50.739 --> 41:52.506
Andre, if I sign these papers,

41:52.507 --> 41:55.643
that's me admitting
that there will be no future,

41:55.644 --> 41:57.745
that you'll be gone.

41:57.746 --> 42:00.080
That's what's gonna happen, Teri.

42:00.081 --> 42:02.049
You did not come into Quincy's life...

42:02.050 --> 42:05.219
into my life... by accident.

42:05.220 --> 42:07.955
My son is back at home
where he belongs

42:07.956 --> 42:09.657
because of you.

42:09.658 --> 42:13.360
This... this is not
how the story ends.

42:24.739 --> 42:26.407
You don't understand.

42:26.408 --> 42:27.808
I understand perfectly.

42:27.809 --> 42:30.911
- No, you don't.
- Yes, I do.

42:30.912 --> 42:34.014
I'm gonna help you fight, Andre.

42:34.015 --> 42:36.483
You...

42:36.484 --> 42:39.153
You did the impossible...

42:39.154 --> 42:41.255
for me.

42:43.258 --> 42:45.259
And so I'm gonna do

42:45.260 --> 42:47.795
the impossible for you.

42:51.399 --> 42:52.800
How?

42:55.370 --> 42:57.371
How?

43:07.482 --> 43:09.049
TERI: It's okay.
