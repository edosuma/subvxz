WEBVTT

00:00.473 --> 00:02.466
Previously on "Greenleaf"...

00:04.273 --> 00:06.379
Jacob is having an affair with Alexa.

00:06.414 --> 00:07.942
What are you talking about?

00:07.978 --> 00:10.346
You texted the wrong person.

00:10.380 --> 00:13.049
As minister of music,
I'm well within my rights

00:13.083 --> 00:15.584
to ask you to modify
the order of worship.

00:15.619 --> 00:18.935
Just let me know what song my choir
should sing as it crashes down,

00:18.969 --> 00:20.756
and then I'll pick up the pieces.

00:20.791 --> 00:22.042
Here it is, son.

00:22.325 --> 00:24.163
You're not ready for leadership.

00:24.532 --> 00:26.796
- What do you mean?
- I'm setting you down.

00:27.297 --> 00:28.831
Who's going to preach on third Sundays?

00:28.865 --> 00:30.633
I'll find somebody.

00:30.667 --> 00:32.500
Have you given any more
thought to my request?

00:33.013 --> 00:35.771
- I can do it.
- Oh, praise God.

00:35.806 --> 00:36.806
I won't preach.

00:37.314 --> 00:38.306
We'll see about that.

00:39.502 --> 00:40.922
One thing, though, Daddy.

00:40.956 --> 00:42.845
The first thing I'm going
to do is start a small group

00:42.879 --> 00:44.311
for the victims of sexual abuse.

00:48.594 --> 00:51.274
My dad hated me before I was even born.

00:52.598 --> 00:56.568
He was mad at my mom for getting
pregnant with a second child

00:56.602 --> 00:58.752
when he couldn't afford the first.

00:59.605 --> 01:01.575
He always held that against me.

01:03.242 --> 01:06.244
When I was eight, my mom divorced him.

01:11.016 --> 01:13.516
And then she met Keith.

01:15.726 --> 01:18.390
One night, we were all
sitting in the living room

01:19.024 --> 01:20.229
watching a movie.

01:20.826 --> 01:22.509
Mom was snoring on the couch,

01:22.828 --> 01:24.606
and I was sitting on the floor.

01:26.265 --> 01:30.349
And he said I could, like,

01:30.803 --> 01:32.423
lean against his legs.

01:33.903 --> 01:35.005
The way he said it,

01:36.479 --> 01:38.209
it sounded like something normal,

01:38.762 --> 01:40.208
something nice.

01:41.783 --> 01:43.078
So I did it.

01:45.718 --> 01:49.584
He massaged my shoulders,

01:50.456 --> 01:53.342
the back of my neck.

01:55.207 --> 01:57.686
And because my mom
and sister were right there,

01:58.097 --> 01:59.330
I thought it was okay.

02:02.839 --> 02:05.992
I didn't know what good dads
were supposed to be like.

02:07.000 --> 02:13.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:17.283 --> 02:18.316
Thank you.

02:22.121 --> 02:23.488
That took a lot of courage.

02:23.522 --> 02:24.774
It wasn't courage.

02:25.491 --> 02:27.492
Ever since I heard you were
starting this program,

02:27.526 --> 02:30.643
I felt like I had
an apple stuck in my throat.

02:31.497 --> 02:33.710
I knew I had to come just to,

02:33.933 --> 02:36.704
you know, get it out.

02:38.871 --> 02:41.472
If you ever need anything,
anything at all...

02:41.507 --> 02:43.937
Stacy, let's go.

02:46.145 --> 02:48.313
- Come on, now.
- I'll see you next week.

02:48.347 --> 02:50.615
- Yeah. Thanks.
- Okay.

03:47.543 --> 03:51.048
Well, I still think I prefer
"The Wizard Of Oz."

03:52.448 --> 03:54.682
This whole mania for seeing

03:54.717 --> 03:57.142
the supposed good in bad people,

03:57.716 --> 03:59.754
it's just decadence.

04:01.457 --> 04:03.132
Thank you.

04:06.629 --> 04:09.182
I'm due to preach in Birmingham Sunday.

04:09.861 --> 04:12.667
Already? My word.

04:12.925 --> 04:15.270
The months just fly by like weeks.

04:17.995 --> 04:20.207
I was thinking of
having Gigi cover for me.

04:20.242 --> 04:21.676
Oh, at Birmingham Baptist?

04:21.999 --> 04:24.530
No, no. Right here at Calvary.

04:26.282 --> 04:28.116
Why would you ever do that?

04:28.425 --> 04:30.251
I can't be in two places at once.

04:30.286 --> 04:32.454
No, James, why would you invite someone

04:32.488 --> 04:35.557
who is so obviously at odds
with the church, your family?

04:35.898 --> 04:37.544
She's not that at odds.

04:38.894 --> 04:40.261
The Sisters Of Tamar?

04:40.712 --> 04:42.930
It's a fine idea for a small group.

04:47.102 --> 04:49.871
James, that group is nothing

04:49.905 --> 04:52.073
but a slap in our face, and you know it.

04:52.107 --> 04:53.842
And then you want to let her
get up in front of everyone

04:53.876 --> 04:55.276
and say what?

04:55.311 --> 04:56.644
Whatever the Lord gives her to say.

04:56.679 --> 04:59.871
Just reinstate Jacob
and be done with it.

05:00.683 --> 05:03.017
It's not like you haven't been human.

05:05.736 --> 05:08.288
James, you have to forgive
Jacob for his failings

05:08.324 --> 05:10.978
at least as much
as you've forgiven yourself.

05:14.330 --> 05:17.699
You're not planning on
reinstating Jacob ever, are...

05:17.733 --> 05:19.334
When Jacob shows me that he understands

05:19.368 --> 05:20.894
the meaning of the position,

05:21.136 --> 05:22.337
I'll be happy to reinstate him.

05:22.371 --> 05:24.072
- Are you?
- Mae!

05:26.375 --> 05:28.910
If Gigi hadn't left, this whole notion

05:28.944 --> 05:31.229
of Jacob in the pulpit
would never have arisen.

05:31.714 --> 05:33.314
He'd have found his natural place.

05:33.349 --> 05:34.516
Where?

05:34.550 --> 05:36.117
What doghouse would he be sleeping in

05:36.151 --> 05:37.552
if I hadn't forced you

05:37.586 --> 05:38.920
from the day that Grace left here

05:38.954 --> 05:40.518
to bring him in out of the rain?

05:41.156 --> 05:43.142
I don't know what kind of work...

05:45.004 --> 05:46.628
that that boy is genuinely suited for,

05:47.221 --> 05:48.429
and neither does he.

05:49.198 --> 05:50.565
But if we have one chance
to set things right

05:50.599 --> 05:53.789
and get Gigi back in the pulpit,

05:54.957 --> 05:56.069
that's what we're going to do.

05:56.621 --> 05:59.773
At whose expense? Jacob's?

06:01.157 --> 06:02.376
Mine?

06:05.381 --> 06:06.614
Are you trying to start a war?

06:06.989 --> 06:07.958
No.

06:09.785 --> 06:10.852
I'm trying to end one.

06:19.995 --> 06:21.423
Are you coming to bed?

06:22.131 --> 06:23.088
In a while.

06:23.799 --> 06:26.935
I'm just trying to finish up some stuff.

06:30.673 --> 06:32.487
More fantasy football.

06:33.842 --> 06:35.677
Why do you waste your time with that?

06:35.711 --> 06:37.216
It's not a waste of time.

06:38.447 --> 06:40.415
When I was out
at Deion's bachelor party,

06:40.449 --> 06:41.783
he introduced me to a friend of his.

06:41.817 --> 06:43.952
- A friend.
- Yeah.

06:43.986 --> 06:46.387
- What's her name?
- Greg.

06:48.958 --> 06:51.526
He's the new head of development

06:51.560 --> 06:53.477
out at Voice of Life in Birdsong.

06:54.697 --> 06:56.664
I've been talking
fantasy football with him

06:56.699 --> 06:58.666
as a way to, you know, get in the door

06:58.701 --> 06:59.834
to have a conversation with him

06:59.868 --> 07:01.541
about putting Daddy on TV.

07:04.273 --> 07:06.708
Want to keep on looking like that now?

07:07.484 --> 07:08.508
Okay.

07:09.245 --> 07:10.445
He and his wife are coming over

07:10.479 --> 07:12.245
tomorrow night to talk about it

07:12.815 --> 07:13.915
if that's all right with you.

07:14.325 --> 07:17.351
I didn't know. I'm sorry.

07:25.728 --> 07:29.063
I told Nigel about this idea
I had for an arrangement.

07:29.098 --> 07:30.332
You know the song "Praise You"?

07:30.899 --> 07:32.066
- Fatboy Slim.
- Yeah.

07:32.101 --> 07:33.128
I love that.

07:33.163 --> 07:35.069
The way he looked at me,

07:35.104 --> 07:36.304
you would've thought I'd killed his cat.

07:36.338 --> 07:38.072
You should just fire that joker.

07:38.395 --> 07:40.308
He'd go straight over to Triumph.

07:40.342 --> 07:41.576
Basie's been wooing him for years.

07:41.610 --> 07:43.244
Well, let them have each other.

07:43.278 --> 07:44.646
Don't you have a pile of résumés

07:44.680 --> 07:45.847
you've been collecting over the years

07:45.881 --> 07:47.081
for every time you got all mad at Nigel

07:47.116 --> 07:48.211
and had to post that job?

07:48.517 --> 07:50.051
Nigel's really good, though.

07:50.085 --> 07:51.395
Yeah, but he's not good for you.

07:51.787 --> 07:53.267
Cut him loose. It would
be better for everybody.

07:54.123 --> 07:55.491
Why be unhappy?

07:56.158 --> 07:58.426
And I know Latonya's gonna do a
fantastic job with that solo.

07:58.460 --> 07:59.427
Nigel.

07:59.461 --> 08:01.029
She has a way with 12/8.

08:01.063 --> 08:02.664
I told her, me?
I'm better with the boogie.

08:02.698 --> 08:04.332
Nigel. Nigel!

08:04.366 --> 08:07.769
I don't want Latonya singing
any more solos this year.

08:10.205 --> 08:11.906
I know you ladies think that she's flat.

08:11.940 --> 08:13.875
We don't think she's flat, Nigel.

08:13.909 --> 08:15.143
She's flat.

08:15.522 --> 08:17.052
Charity, you pick the songs.

08:17.880 --> 08:19.080
I've learned to live with that.

08:19.114 --> 08:20.748
Nigel, I don't want to hear

08:20.783 --> 08:23.151
Latonya singing that solo this Sunday.

08:23.185 --> 08:25.553
Then maybe you'd rather hear
her from a great distance,

08:25.587 --> 08:27.155
say, across town?

08:27.450 --> 08:29.856
- You mean at Triumph?
- I didn't say Triumph.

08:30.195 --> 08:31.483
But now that you bring it up,

08:32.448 --> 08:34.562
I will say Pastor Skanks has offered me

08:34.596 --> 08:36.364
complete artistic control.

08:36.398 --> 08:38.533
- Then take it.
- Pardon me?

08:38.567 --> 08:40.051
Take it, Nigel!

08:49.178 --> 08:51.506
Pastor Greenleaf, you got a minute?

08:52.381 --> 08:53.625
Please.

08:54.383 --> 08:56.150
What's that you got there?

08:56.185 --> 08:58.398
Stories from the women
in my support group.

08:59.188 --> 09:00.797
The ones who won't talk, they write.

09:01.457 --> 09:02.623
Some of them won't even write.

09:02.948 --> 09:04.573
Well, it's good they have you

09:05.427 --> 09:07.669
feeling their pain like this.

09:09.031 --> 09:12.870
You know, that's the Lord
in you, you know, caring.

09:13.635 --> 09:16.437
I'm totally unable to go back and
stop any of it from happening.

09:16.773 --> 09:21.221
That's the Lord, too,
mourning that sad fact.

09:22.010 --> 09:25.910
This is ministry. It's nice
to see you coming along.

09:30.018 --> 09:31.133
What did I do now?

09:32.855 --> 09:34.288
I want you to preach on Sunday.

09:34.323 --> 09:35.757
Now, I know our deal was

09:35.791 --> 09:37.277
that you weren't going to preach.

09:38.327 --> 09:39.827
But our sister church in Birmingham,

09:39.862 --> 09:41.395
they count on hearing from me
every third Sunday.

09:41.430 --> 09:43.854
- So, reinstate Jacob.
- No.

09:45.100 --> 09:46.901
But I'll be happy to tell your mother

09:46.935 --> 09:48.736
that you and she finally
agree on something for once.

09:48.771 --> 09:51.539
- Daddy.
- All the best seats at God's table

09:51.573 --> 09:53.908
are filled with reluctant saints.

09:53.942 --> 09:55.955
I don't want to preach again.

09:58.580 --> 09:59.981
What is this dug-in position

10:00.015 --> 10:01.482
that you've taken against preaching?

10:01.517 --> 10:03.242
It's not what I came home to do.

10:05.954 --> 10:08.990
Well, you're the associate
pastor, and I can't be here,

10:10.496 --> 10:12.087
so you're going to do it.

10:13.962 --> 10:15.143
Carry on.

10:22.671 --> 10:24.572
- So...
- What happened?

10:25.182 --> 10:26.839
Aunt Charity just texted,

10:27.209 --> 10:29.544
and I'm going to be singing
a solo Sunday in church.

10:29.578 --> 10:30.945
Baby, congratulations.

10:30.979 --> 10:32.079
Come here. That's great.

10:32.114 --> 10:33.548
Good, good.

10:34.249 --> 10:36.484
Maybe you could preach
the sermon for me, too.

10:36.518 --> 10:38.119
Or sing it, huh?

10:38.153 --> 10:39.700
What's the book?

10:40.189 --> 10:41.789
Oh, it's something Thomas Sneed gave me

10:41.824 --> 10:43.791
when he heard that
I was preaching on Sunday.

10:43.826 --> 10:45.793
"Sermon Helps For Busy Servants."

10:45.828 --> 10:46.900
Mm-hmm.

10:47.908 --> 10:49.664
I think he has a crush on you.

10:49.698 --> 10:52.200
Oh, no. He has a crush on my job,

10:52.234 --> 10:54.246
and I wish they'd run away together.

10:55.060 --> 10:57.071
Aren't you even a little bit
excited to preach again?

10:57.105 --> 10:59.572
- No.
- Why not?

11:00.442 --> 11:02.109
It seems like it would be a lot of fun

11:02.144 --> 11:05.528
to get up there and just
say whatever you want.

11:06.148 --> 11:07.660
But it's not saying whatever you want.

11:08.450 --> 11:09.550
That's not what it's like.

11:10.176 --> 11:11.618
Then what is it like?

11:14.656 --> 11:17.933
It's kind of like having somebody
else talking through you.

11:19.027 --> 11:21.267
That doesn't sound so bad.

11:21.563 --> 11:23.865
No, it's not. Not in and of itself.

11:23.899 --> 11:27.228
It's just a question of...

11:28.470 --> 11:30.284
what's worth letting that person in

11:31.019 --> 11:32.773
and, really, what isn't.

11:35.844 --> 11:38.212
Okay, well, I am just glad

11:38.247 --> 11:40.314
to have you be the one with
homework for a change.

11:40.980 --> 11:43.017
Thank you.

11:43.051 --> 11:44.018
Good luck.

11:44.659 --> 11:45.869
Thanks, Mom.

11:51.293 --> 11:53.060
How many people every Sunday?

11:53.095 --> 11:54.295
4,000.

11:54.763 --> 11:56.264
But we've actually got sister churches

11:56.298 --> 11:59.066
in Birmingham,
Little Rock, and Knoxville.

11:59.101 --> 12:02.270
So, you know,
that's a ready-made audience.

12:02.304 --> 12:04.205
And he's written books, too, right?

12:04.239 --> 12:05.206
Absolutely.

12:05.240 --> 12:06.540
As a matter of fact, I'll send you some.

12:06.575 --> 12:08.075
That'd be great,

12:08.110 --> 12:09.264
something to show to
my people at the network.

12:09.811 --> 12:11.212
Don't let us interrupt.

12:11.246 --> 12:12.813
No, please interrupt.

12:12.848 --> 12:14.448
Please, we've been missing you ladies.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.617
- Aww.
- This looks amazing.

12:16.871 --> 12:19.607
- Careful, it's hot.
- I'm sure.

12:20.455 --> 12:23.057
- What is it?
- Portobello mushroom and goat cheese.

12:23.091 --> 12:25.293
It's something my mother always
used to make for company.

12:25.839 --> 12:29.230
Mmm. Baby, you've got
to get this recipe.

12:29.264 --> 12:31.132
And the staff to cook it as well.

12:31.166 --> 12:32.466
Don't be fooled.

12:32.501 --> 12:33.634
You have to teach them

12:33.669 --> 12:35.036
how to do everything.

12:35.070 --> 12:36.871
Sometimes I think it'd be easier

12:36.905 --> 12:38.844
if I just did it myself.

12:39.675 --> 12:40.741
Where you from, Kerissa?

12:40.776 --> 12:42.877
- Houston.
- I love Houston.

12:43.654 --> 12:45.379
Nobody loves Houston.

12:45.414 --> 12:48.115
No, I do. They have an art
collection down there...

12:48.150 --> 12:50.251
- The Menil.
- That's it.

12:50.285 --> 12:51.519
I love that place.

12:51.553 --> 12:52.720
That's my favorite.

12:53.922 --> 12:56.257
So, Jacob, what's it like

12:56.291 --> 12:58.259
to live in the same
house as your parents?

12:58.870 --> 13:00.994
- Terrible.
- Seriously?

13:01.278 --> 13:03.423
I thought it would be
a good place for the kids.

13:03.932 --> 13:06.767
Oh, yeah. You know, I was just kidding.

13:06.802 --> 13:09.036
You're so silly.

13:09.071 --> 13:10.972
Oh, God.

13:12.975 --> 13:14.475
What's the matter?

13:14.509 --> 13:16.510
It's so hard to choose.

13:17.143 --> 13:18.333
Between what, babe?

13:18.947 --> 13:21.032
Candidates for Nigel's job.

13:21.550 --> 13:24.085
I mean, not even someone to
hire, just someone to meet.

13:24.678 --> 13:26.920
Everybody's got
all these files to listen to

13:26.955 --> 13:29.791
and these super long statements.

13:30.759 --> 13:32.927
Well, don't take it so seriously.

13:32.961 --> 13:34.795
What if I end up with another Nigel?

13:35.199 --> 13:36.895
Who cares? It's just an interview.

13:38.000 --> 13:40.167
Okay, look, look.
Let's have some fun with it.

13:40.202 --> 13:42.687
Put the maybes to the right,
nevers to the left. Go.

13:43.572 --> 13:45.539
- Based on what, though?
- Whatever.

13:45.574 --> 13:49.170
You know, the picture
if they have one. Name?

13:49.585 --> 13:51.001
Just go for it.

13:51.580 --> 13:53.447
Like one of those dating apps?

13:53.482 --> 13:55.971
Yeah, you know, I guess.

13:56.985 --> 14:01.355
Okay. Maybe. Never.

14:01.979 --> 14:03.189
- Oh.
- Nah, nah, nah.

14:03.225 --> 14:04.449
Don't slow down. Just do it.

14:04.942 --> 14:08.162
Maybe. Uh, never.

14:08.196 --> 14:10.364
Ooh, never.

14:10.399 --> 14:12.833
Never. Maybe.

14:12.868 --> 14:16.370
There, I have respected and disrespected

14:16.405 --> 14:19.807
two sets of humans I know nothing about.

14:19.841 --> 14:24.779
Well, half won't know
and the other half won't care.

14:24.813 --> 14:27.948
Now, let me get these no-account
losers out of the way for you,

14:27.983 --> 14:30.349
and who do we have on top over there?

14:30.819 --> 14:33.521
- Carlton C. Cruise.
- Carlton C. Cruise. Give him a call.

14:34.054 --> 14:36.424
- What?
- Yeah, I mean, it's just an interview.

14:37.628 --> 14:39.525
It's not like you got to marry the guy.

14:42.914 --> 14:46.833
- Okay. Thank you.
- You got it.

14:51.239 --> 14:52.840
I'm so glad we're already married

14:52.874 --> 14:54.355
and we don't have to
deal with this stuff.

14:54.843 --> 14:57.611
- What stuff, babe?
- Dating apps.

14:57.646 --> 14:58.946
It seems so lonely.

14:59.850 --> 15:01.215
Yeah.

15:01.249 --> 15:02.750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

15:03.234 --> 15:05.418
We got it in just under the wire.

15:11.927 --> 15:14.178
So sorry to wake you.

15:16.043 --> 15:18.065
Oh, no. You didn't wake me.

15:18.100 --> 15:21.102
I mean, you did, but I
fell asleep reading, so...

15:22.466 --> 15:24.875
- You want to... - Oh,
this won't take a second.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.241
What's the matter, Mama?

15:30.112 --> 15:31.946
You're preaching this Sunday.

15:32.123 --> 15:33.484
Yeah.

15:34.282 --> 15:35.649
That wasn't my idea.

15:35.684 --> 15:37.948
Oh, I know whose idea it was,

15:38.687 --> 15:40.321
and I just wanted you to know, dear,

15:40.355 --> 15:43.691
in case it ever occurred
to you to doubt it at all,

15:43.725 --> 15:45.728
you have my complete support.

15:46.193 --> 15:47.195
Thank you for letting me know.

15:48.763 --> 15:50.503
I still remember, you know?

15:51.299 --> 15:52.933
Just like it was yesterday.

15:52.968 --> 15:55.062
You were five years old

15:55.337 --> 15:59.140
when you recited your first Easter piece

15:59.174 --> 16:00.541
in front of the church.

16:00.575 --> 16:01.575
Do you remember?

16:01.610 --> 16:03.944
Um, Jesus appearing before Mary?

16:03.979 --> 16:05.312
John 20.

16:07.349 --> 16:09.083
And everybody walked up

16:09.117 --> 16:12.119
to your father and me
afterwards, and they said,

16:12.154 --> 16:16.014
"Ooh, that is one talky child."

16:18.760 --> 16:20.427
And we were so proud.

16:25.367 --> 16:28.702
So, I guess what I want to say...

16:31.006 --> 16:32.973
...is that I hope it's your intent

16:33.008 --> 16:38.546
to use the authority of the pulpit
on Sunday for institutional purposes

16:38.580 --> 16:41.615
and not as a switch
to punish us publically.

16:43.985 --> 16:46.353
That would be
such a cruel thing to do...

16:46.388 --> 16:49.557
to your father,
especially in his absence.

16:49.591 --> 16:52.693
- Don't you agree?
- Mama?

16:53.495 --> 16:54.495
Yes, dear?

16:55.774 --> 16:57.259
Do you love me at all?

16:57.926 --> 17:00.031
What a ludicrous question.

17:00.065 --> 17:01.535
No, it's a real question.

17:03.606 --> 17:04.767
Do you love me?

17:05.176 --> 17:07.141
Of course I love you, Grace.

17:10.612 --> 17:12.291
I also love your father,

17:12.714 --> 17:14.781
and I love this church.

17:15.019 --> 17:20.086
And I just hope that you
approach this opportunity

17:20.121 --> 17:24.356
with the appropriate
humility, that's all,

17:25.060 --> 17:26.051
for your sake.

17:27.614 --> 17:29.051
Do you understand?

17:32.267 --> 17:33.388
Yeah.

17:33.868 --> 17:35.669
Then I'll let you be.

17:38.473 --> 17:39.840
Good night, dear.

17:39.874 --> 17:40.941
Good night.

17:47.150 --> 17:49.849
Jacob, your beautiful
lady distracted me.

17:49.884 --> 17:51.061
I'm not complaining,

17:51.096 --> 17:52.987
but I feel we didn't even get a chance

17:53.021 --> 17:54.188
to talk about the pitch for the show.

17:54.222 --> 17:55.389
Oh, it's all good.

17:55.423 --> 17:58.125
We'll find some time maybe next week

17:58.159 --> 17:59.810
over lunch, just you and me.

18:00.862 --> 18:03.464
I've got a better idea.
You all good, baby?

18:03.820 --> 18:04.931
Yeah.

18:04.966 --> 18:06.767
All good for what?

18:06.801 --> 18:09.113
We just bought this beautiful
place over in Birdsong.

18:10.205 --> 18:12.840
It's a cabin in the woods,
only 3,000 square feet.

18:13.344 --> 18:16.000
We've got a hot tub on the deck...

18:16.478 --> 18:17.312
lots of room.

18:17.912 --> 18:19.274
We can make a night of it.

18:20.115 --> 18:22.950
- You mean, like, stay over?
- You and I could get lit,

18:22.984 --> 18:24.885
brainstorm about what your
daddy's show could be.

18:24.919 --> 18:26.887
Let these lovely ladies soak in the tub

18:26.921 --> 18:28.649
underneath the stars.

18:29.417 --> 18:31.258
With no parents around, of course.

18:31.293 --> 18:32.529
That's right.

18:32.927 --> 18:35.489
No parents to see the mischief
we all might get up to,

18:36.265 --> 18:37.456
you know what I'm saying?

18:39.489 --> 18:40.529
Think about it.

18:42.003 --> 18:44.075
I want to hammer out
this pitch and get it done.

18:44.801 --> 18:47.174
- Me, too.
- Fantastic.

18:47.440 --> 18:50.015
Well, it's past our bedtime,
so we'll see ourselves out.

18:52.259 --> 18:53.681
- It was great meeting you.
- You, too.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.083
- You, too.
- All right, thank you.

18:56.117 --> 18:58.218
- All right.
- Night.

18:58.253 --> 18:59.219
Drive safely.

18:59.254 --> 19:00.621
We'll be in touch.

19:05.193 --> 19:06.660
What the hell was that?

19:15.804 --> 19:17.304
Whoa.

19:41.229 --> 19:42.896
What do you think you're doing?

19:58.246 --> 19:59.213
Hey.

20:02.687 --> 20:04.119
- Pastor?
- Hey.

20:05.075 --> 20:06.186
Here you go.

20:06.221 --> 20:08.204
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

20:08.890 --> 20:10.858
So few people return books nowadays.

20:10.892 --> 20:12.493
I have to confess,
I've come to think of it

20:12.527 --> 20:13.861
as a minor miracle when it happens.

20:14.668 --> 20:17.196
What are you going to preach about?

20:17.232 --> 20:19.900
I'm not sure yet. I probably should be,

20:19.934 --> 20:22.136
- considering it's tomorrow, huh?
- No, no.

20:22.170 --> 20:24.405
I preach every Wednesday night
at the group home on my block,

20:24.439 --> 20:26.440
as a blessing to the young folks there.

20:26.708 --> 20:28.041
Pastor, that's great.

20:28.269 --> 20:31.043
And the Lord always
gives me something to say,

20:31.079 --> 20:34.047
and it's almost always
at the last minute.

20:34.469 --> 20:36.650
It could be He shows me something

20:36.684 --> 20:38.318
in a movie I'm watching online.

20:38.612 --> 20:41.355
Or it could be something someone says

20:41.389 --> 20:43.123
when they don't even know
they're being used by the Lord

20:43.158 --> 20:44.925
to provide the seed for my message.

20:44.959 --> 20:46.008
Yeah.

20:46.208 --> 20:48.929
Or it could be a leaf
falling from a tree.

20:48.963 --> 20:51.331
But He is always on...

20:51.366 --> 20:52.332
Brother Kendall, come on in, please.

20:52.367 --> 20:53.767
Sorry to barge in.

20:54.163 --> 20:55.468
Grace, there's someone in your office.

20:55.503 --> 20:57.567
Excuse me, Pastor.

20:59.407 --> 21:00.774
Thank you.

21:03.378 --> 21:05.646
It's Stacy. She's
beaten up pretty badly.

21:05.680 --> 21:07.414
She's in your office right now.

21:07.449 --> 21:08.882
- What?
- Yeah, I think it was her husband.

21:09.475 --> 21:11.217
I just feel awful.

21:11.622 --> 21:14.754
Look, you can't control
what everyone's going to do.

21:14.789 --> 21:16.604
You just keep telling the truth

21:17.592 --> 21:19.851
and encouraging others to do the same.

21:21.029 --> 21:24.331
Look, you're doing the right thing.

21:25.035 --> 21:26.333
Thank you.

21:29.871 --> 21:31.508
Stacy.

21:37.812 --> 21:39.613
Yeah. Yeah.

21:42.250 --> 21:43.584
I'm so sorry.

21:45.820 --> 21:47.421
It's going to be okay.

21:51.676 --> 21:53.676
I understand. Thanks.

21:54.916 --> 21:56.250
So, what's the deal?

21:56.284 --> 21:58.886
Well, unfortunately,

21:58.920 --> 22:01.188
the woman's shelter we work
with is full right now.

22:01.223 --> 22:02.452
Is there any space here tonight?

22:02.487 --> 22:03.652
Not really.

22:03.687 --> 22:05.597
We're hosting men from
Shelter from the Storm.

22:06.261 --> 22:08.037
Now, I could put in a call to county.

22:08.318 --> 22:11.643
I can't take my kids to county.

22:12.447 --> 22:13.632
Last time we went there,

22:13.667 --> 22:15.636
the woman in the bunk
below us had a cough.

22:15.670 --> 22:17.238
She barked all night long.

22:17.272 --> 22:19.448
The kids got sick. I got pneumonia.

22:21.109 --> 22:22.643
- I can just go home.
- No, no.

22:22.677 --> 22:24.578
Oh, no, no, no. You're
not going back there.

22:24.613 --> 22:26.094
We'll figure something out.

22:27.282 --> 22:28.008
Yeah.

22:28.550 --> 22:30.484
I was a P.K., you know?

22:30.519 --> 22:33.421
Oh, just like me, obviously.

22:33.455 --> 22:35.723
It's a calling.

22:35.757 --> 22:39.527
Yeah, I grew up singing and
playing in my father's church

22:39.561 --> 22:43.097
and I have some very fond memories

22:43.131 --> 22:44.465
of being in the youth choir

22:44.499 --> 22:46.467
and singing "Jesus, Be A Fence."

22:46.720 --> 22:49.670
- Oh, I love that song.
- What?

22:49.704 --> 22:52.473
♪ Jesus, be a fence all around me ♪

22:52.507 --> 22:54.742
- ♪ Every day...
- That's right.

22:54.776 --> 22:57.645
♪ Jesus, I want You to protect me ♪

22:57.679 --> 23:01.816
♪ As I travel along the way ♪

23:01.850 --> 23:03.717
- ♪ I know You can
- ♪ Yes, Lord

23:03.752 --> 23:05.719
- ♪ I know You will
- ♪ Yes, Lord

23:05.754 --> 23:08.489
♪ Fight my battles
if I just keep still ♪

23:08.523 --> 23:10.491
♪ Yes, Lord

23:10.525 --> 23:14.929
♪ Lord, be a fence
all around me every day. ♪

23:14.963 --> 23:16.297
- Yeah!
- That was fun!

23:16.331 --> 23:17.598
Amen.

23:17.632 --> 23:18.933
I can't remember the last time

23:18.967 --> 23:20.734
I had fun with my choir director.

23:20.769 --> 23:22.269
Oh, well, that's a shame.

23:22.304 --> 23:23.938
The way I see it,

23:23.972 --> 23:28.142
the choir director is like the
vibe manager of the church.

23:28.176 --> 23:30.544
I mean, if you can't have fun
with your choir director,

23:30.579 --> 23:31.979
then no one's having fun.

23:32.255 --> 23:35.649
- I like you.
- I like you, too.

23:38.171 --> 23:40.573
I don't know why you called.
I'm glad you did.

23:41.008 --> 23:43.918
It sure is nice getting away from
that club for a few minutes.

23:44.611 --> 23:46.579
I tell you, sometimes I
look up from my work

23:46.613 --> 23:50.049
and I think if the Lord is still
looking out of these eyes,

23:50.083 --> 23:52.134
He sure is bored.

23:53.120 --> 23:54.533
I'm sure He is.

23:55.188 --> 23:56.525
Looking out, that is.

23:57.829 --> 24:00.893
So, what's going on, James?

24:03.397 --> 24:04.764
Gigi's preaching tomorrow.

24:04.798 --> 24:07.733
Preaching? Seriously?

24:07.768 --> 24:09.502
11 AM, if you're interested.

24:12.205 --> 24:13.472
This is her idea?

24:13.507 --> 24:16.475
No, no. I asked her to do it.

24:16.830 --> 24:20.021
And what does Mae
have to say about this?

24:20.614 --> 24:23.862
She's characteristically ecstatic.

24:24.818 --> 24:26.510
But what I wanted to know is,

24:27.220 --> 24:29.574
when I asked her to do it, she said no.

24:30.524 --> 24:35.127
Then when I asked her
why she was so set against it,

24:36.229 --> 24:39.517
she said that's not
what she came home to do.

24:40.233 --> 24:41.566
Do you know what she meant?

24:42.869 --> 24:44.537
What did she come home to do?

24:46.673 --> 24:48.741
- You know.
- No, I don't,

24:49.150 --> 24:51.877
- though I really...
- Yes, you do.

24:52.679 --> 24:55.214
You know, and that's why you called me.

24:55.248 --> 24:56.949
That's why you came by here to see me,

24:56.983 --> 24:59.446
to let me know you know.

25:02.456 --> 25:05.124
- What?
- Well...

25:05.997 --> 25:08.526
Whenever I'm with you like this,

25:09.896 --> 25:12.606
it occurs to me that, well,

25:14.101 --> 25:15.686
maybe I missed my life.

25:16.136 --> 25:19.118
You know, like a train.

25:20.507 --> 25:21.807
Did I miss it?

25:25.512 --> 25:29.749
Trains leave the station
every day, James.

25:29.783 --> 25:31.384
You just got to get off.

25:35.989 --> 25:39.629
Okay, then, if you need
anything else, just call me.

25:40.127 --> 25:42.695
- Otherwise...
- I don't need to know anything else.

25:42.729 --> 25:46.832
- No?
- No. You're hired.

25:47.790 --> 25:51.047
Oh, don't tell me you have
other offers on the table.

25:51.538 --> 25:53.939
I'm not going to let the best
meeting I have ever had...

25:53.974 --> 25:56.308
No, no, no, no. It's not that.

25:56.343 --> 25:57.810
So, what's the problem?

25:58.277 --> 25:59.744
There's something that you should know

25:59.780 --> 26:01.480
before you pull that trigger.

26:01.515 --> 26:02.775
Okay.

26:03.550 --> 26:06.519
I wasn't completely
up front about myself

26:06.553 --> 26:07.720
in my last two jobs,

26:07.754 --> 26:10.901
and it caused problems later.

26:11.229 --> 26:13.726
And I just want to put all
my cards out on the table,

26:13.760 --> 26:15.308
full disclosure.

26:16.196 --> 26:17.396
I'm gay.

26:18.565 --> 26:20.032
That's no problem.

26:20.269 --> 26:21.533
Are you sure?

26:22.002 --> 26:24.970
Because I have a partner
and he'd be coming to church.

26:25.789 --> 26:27.029
That's fine.

26:27.574 --> 26:30.576
I just want that music and this...

26:30.610 --> 26:33.179
this thing that we've got going here.

26:34.124 --> 26:36.181
Okay, then.

26:36.216 --> 26:37.463
Praise God.

26:39.219 --> 26:41.120
Okay, come tomorrow at 10:30

26:41.154 --> 26:43.255
and I will show you around.

26:43.596 --> 26:44.590
It's a date.

27:05.045 --> 27:06.176
Greg, what's up?

27:08.559 --> 27:09.831
Yeah. Uh-huh.

27:12.419 --> 27:14.587
I'm sorry I couldn't go to county.

27:14.621 --> 27:16.589
I just couldn't do it again.

27:16.623 --> 27:18.390
They have a way of making you feel

27:18.425 --> 27:19.984
like you're a criminal being there.

27:20.260 --> 27:21.727
I'm just glad you guys are safe.

27:32.472 --> 27:35.528
- Can I ask?
- What happened?

27:36.873 --> 27:39.099
Yeah, if you want to tell me.

27:43.450 --> 27:46.285
When I got home, Cole asked me

27:46.319 --> 27:48.606
what we talked about in the meeting.

27:49.956 --> 27:52.846
I told him what I said about Keith.

27:55.428 --> 27:59.866
He said that wasn't
anybody else's business,

28:00.367 --> 28:03.746
that I made myself look bad
telling stories like that,

28:04.371 --> 28:05.871
that I made him look bad.

28:05.906 --> 28:06.986
You made him look bad?

28:07.737 --> 28:08.995
For being with me.

28:11.144 --> 28:13.640
He said I couldn't go back
to group next week,

28:13.674 --> 28:15.548
and I said I was going to.

28:15.582 --> 28:20.452
I said I felt better now
that I said something and...

28:24.524 --> 28:26.492
I promise I won't stay
more than one night

28:26.526 --> 28:28.494
and I'll pay the church back

28:28.528 --> 28:29.595
as soon as I get some money.

28:29.629 --> 28:31.116
- Stacy.
- Girls?

28:31.364 --> 28:32.598
Go brush your teeth.

28:35.735 --> 28:37.770
Stacy, come here. He hit you.

28:38.076 --> 28:40.139
You can't go back to that,

28:40.173 --> 28:41.650
not without him getting help.

28:41.685 --> 28:44.843
You can't do that. Come here. Sit down.

28:48.348 --> 28:50.319
I'm not saying you should break up.

28:51.384 --> 28:52.651
I'm just saying don't go back.

28:54.454 --> 28:55.936
Not yet, anyway.

28:57.023 --> 28:58.157
You can't.

28:58.191 --> 28:59.158
I know you think I'm weak.

28:59.192 --> 29:00.526
No, I don't think...

29:00.560 --> 29:02.991
It's just that I grew up
without a father

29:04.197 --> 29:05.965
and I put myself through hell

29:05.999 --> 29:08.367
trying to find a way to fill the hole

29:08.401 --> 29:11.615
that missing piece left
inside me, you know?

29:13.111 --> 29:14.773
I don't want my daughters to grow up

29:14.808 --> 29:15.908
with that same missing piece.

29:15.942 --> 29:17.576
What if he hits them next time?

29:17.611 --> 29:19.345
He won't. I'm the one he's mad at.

29:19.379 --> 29:20.446
What if he hurts them
to get back at you?

29:20.480 --> 29:21.714
You know that happens.

29:21.748 --> 29:23.951
Why are you trying so hard to help?

29:24.884 --> 29:26.285
You told your story.

29:30.590 --> 29:32.091
That's not easy to do.

29:34.027 --> 29:36.127
Don't go back, Stacy.

29:40.033 --> 29:41.392
Mama?

29:42.836 --> 29:44.336
Excuse me.

29:48.642 --> 29:50.165
I got to...

30:06.727 --> 30:08.128
Zora and Winkie around?

30:08.996 --> 30:10.262
Zora's with Sophia

30:10.297 --> 30:13.106
and Winkie's in the kitchen
with Annika, I think.

30:13.333 --> 30:15.301
- Why?
- Greg called.

30:15.335 --> 30:17.433
He wants to know if we want to
come over for dinner tonight.

30:18.005 --> 30:19.177
Oh.

30:20.841 --> 30:22.960
Yeah, let's do that.

30:24.031 --> 30:25.578
You know what he thinks
is going to happen

30:25.612 --> 30:26.812
if we go over there, right?

30:27.449 --> 30:29.215
I have a pretty good idea.

30:29.249 --> 30:30.683
And you're okay with that?

30:32.886 --> 30:34.778
Will it get you that TV deal?

30:35.122 --> 30:37.523
It might. No guarantee.

30:39.826 --> 30:41.327
So, let's go.

30:42.081 --> 30:44.797
- You messing with me?
- Not at all.

30:47.034 --> 30:48.961
You ever stepped out on me before?

30:50.737 --> 30:53.139
Jacob, Grace is preaching tomorrow.

30:53.173 --> 30:54.440
Who knows what your stock is going to be

30:54.474 --> 30:56.409
once she closes that Bible.

30:57.110 --> 30:58.544
We have to do something.

31:01.648 --> 31:02.681
All right.

31:04.084 --> 31:05.618
I'll call him and tell him.

31:05.652 --> 31:06.513
Okay.

31:07.421 --> 31:08.988
I'll have my mom take
Winkie for the night.

31:09.022 --> 31:11.698
He'll like that,
if that's all right with you.

31:12.459 --> 31:13.738
Fine with me.

31:14.861 --> 31:15.752
Fun.

31:22.736 --> 31:26.872
He likes Tasha Cobbs, Travis Greene.

31:26.907 --> 31:28.479
Sounds great. See?

31:28.942 --> 31:30.476
The guy was out there
just waiting for you.

31:30.510 --> 31:32.645
- Happy ending.
- Except one thing.

31:32.679 --> 31:35.408
- What?
- Don't be mad.

31:36.716 --> 31:38.423
What is the problem?

31:39.104 --> 31:40.119
He's gay.

31:40.624 --> 31:41.687
How do you know he's gay?

31:41.712 --> 31:43.604
He told me.

31:44.291 --> 31:47.560
Uh... hello?

31:47.594 --> 31:50.162
- Hey, I saw you called.
- Yeah, I pulled a few strings

31:50.197 --> 31:52.198
and got Stacy a placement
at the Stanton House.

31:52.232 --> 31:54.500
Her and the kids can stay
a month, free of charge.

31:54.534 --> 31:56.702
Oh, my God, that's amazing.

31:56.736 --> 31:58.437
I'm going to go back
and tell her right now.

31:58.472 --> 31:59.638
Bye.

32:01.041 --> 32:02.428
So, he just told you he's gay.

32:02.652 --> 32:04.376
- Yeah.
- Who does that in a job interview?

32:04.816 --> 32:07.012
Gay people? I knew you'd be mad.

32:07.047 --> 32:08.881
I'm not mad, it's just your daddy's

32:08.915 --> 32:10.116
not going to love it, that's for sure.

32:10.150 --> 32:11.584
Like Daddy didn't know about Nigel?

32:11.618 --> 32:13.085
Come on, everybody knew.

32:13.120 --> 32:14.920
Yeah, maybe they did, but, well,

32:14.955 --> 32:17.031
they put up with it
because Nigel never...

32:18.313 --> 32:19.625
he never, you know, said it.

32:19.659 --> 32:22.962
I'm not going to not hire
Carlton just because he's gay.

32:22.996 --> 32:25.030
I'm not saying not to hire
him because he's gay.

32:25.065 --> 32:26.963
- I'm saying don't hire because...
- What? Out?

32:27.901 --> 32:28.899
Isn't that better?

32:29.236 --> 32:31.066
Isn't it better to be honest?

32:31.671 --> 32:33.091
You can do what you want.

32:33.673 --> 32:35.146
I just think it's a mistake.

32:35.809 --> 32:37.176
You're the one who told me

32:37.210 --> 32:38.922
to make two piles and have fun with it.

32:43.083 --> 32:46.719
I know. Believe me, I know.

32:57.844 --> 32:58.891
Hello.

33:00.222 --> 33:01.267
Can I help you?

33:01.301 --> 33:03.802
Hi. Where are the people
who were staying here,

33:03.837 --> 33:05.070
a woman and two kids?

33:05.105 --> 33:06.472
They checked out.

33:13.246 --> 33:16.115
Jacob, come on. I'm ready.

33:21.254 --> 33:23.289
Jacob, I said I'm ready to go.

33:34.601 --> 33:37.970
Jacob, I said I'm ready to go.

33:45.142 --> 33:46.612
What's wrong? Let's go.

33:48.315 --> 33:49.456
I don't want to.

33:54.854 --> 33:56.331
What about the TV deal?

33:56.590 --> 33:57.957
I don't care about it.

34:00.327 --> 34:01.860
You think you're going to get reinstated

34:01.895 --> 34:03.375
just by doing your time?

34:04.698 --> 34:07.128
Sorry, but after tomorrow,
it's going to be much harder.

34:08.001 --> 34:09.960
You were right to come up
with a good plan B.

34:11.905 --> 34:13.888
I won't have another man touching you.

34:14.507 --> 34:15.440
Why the hell not?

34:18.576 --> 34:21.560
You've been making a fool of
me, Jacob, for years now,

34:22.415 --> 34:25.284
making me pay every day
for the one mistake

34:25.318 --> 34:27.367
that you will not forgive,

34:28.121 --> 34:28.918
that...

34:32.659 --> 34:34.183
I love you.

34:35.161 --> 34:36.728
And judging by your behavior,

34:36.763 --> 34:39.130
I don't matter to you at all.

34:39.165 --> 34:41.500
So, Jacob, why the hell
would it matter to you

34:41.534 --> 34:43.911
if some other man touched me?

34:44.737 --> 34:45.960
Because you're mine.

34:46.966 --> 34:48.280
After all you've done?

34:49.775 --> 34:51.844
I didn't say I was perfect, woman.

34:54.007 --> 34:56.275
I just said you're mine.

36:00.246 --> 36:02.996
You sure you don't want to come
to Birmingham with me, darling?

36:03.516 --> 36:05.160
Maiden voyage on your new jet.

36:07.253 --> 36:08.339
No, thank you.

36:09.556 --> 36:11.790
- Mae.
- What?

36:11.825 --> 36:14.067
Do you think I don't
know what you're doing?

36:15.005 --> 36:17.354
I know you better
than you know yourself.

36:18.865 --> 36:19.945
What am I doing?

36:20.367 --> 36:21.713
You tell me.

36:22.302 --> 36:25.085
Come on. Come on.

36:26.924 --> 36:31.080
You're using Grace to punish
me for Faith's death,

36:31.154 --> 36:33.077
but it is not my fault.

36:34.765 --> 36:36.101
I don't think it's your fault.

36:36.136 --> 36:38.871
Oh, yes, you do, and you just need
to go on and at least admit it.

36:38.905 --> 36:39.893
I think...

36:42.864 --> 36:44.298
I think it's our fault.

36:46.998 --> 36:48.036
You should go.

36:59.738 --> 37:01.649
Stacy, this is Pastor Grace.

37:04.988 --> 37:06.855
Could you give me a call
when you get a chance, please?

37:08.625 --> 37:09.667
Please.

37:10.360 --> 37:13.395
Hey, we are going to the kitchen.

37:13.430 --> 37:15.019
Ooh, bring me something back.

37:15.054 --> 37:16.052
Yeah, what do you want?

37:16.087 --> 37:17.640
Uh...

37:18.635 --> 37:19.952
nothing.

37:20.336 --> 37:21.537
What are you going to preach about?

37:21.855 --> 37:23.505
Did she tell you to ask me that?

37:23.540 --> 37:25.599
Inquiring minds want to know.

37:26.559 --> 37:28.110
Still waiting for a sign.

37:30.425 --> 37:31.659
When my dad gets stuck,

37:31.693 --> 37:33.427
he just downloads sermons
off the Internet.

37:33.461 --> 37:35.529
- I doubt that's true.
- It's true.

37:35.563 --> 37:37.431
They have whole sermons
on there... 50 bucks.

37:37.465 --> 37:38.766
He just downloads them, prints them out,

37:38.800 --> 37:39.767
and reads them on the pulpit.

37:40.387 --> 37:41.902
Don't tell him I told you.

37:42.178 --> 37:43.289
Mum's the word.

37:43.805 --> 37:46.128
- We'll bring you something good.
- Thank you.

37:56.851 --> 37:58.118
Oh, boy.

38:11.555 --> 38:13.689
Before I met Bishop, you know,

38:13.724 --> 38:16.058
I had dreams of being a singer.

38:16.093 --> 38:17.751
- Mm, wow.
- Amen.

38:18.528 --> 38:20.337
Oh, excuse us, please.

38:21.281 --> 38:23.376
Oh, what a blessed sight.

38:24.888 --> 38:28.938
I prayed last night for some
good news, and here it is.

38:28.972 --> 38:31.874
The both of you are just so happy,

38:31.908 --> 38:33.609
just like the old days.

38:36.546 --> 38:37.543
Lady Mae...

38:37.568 --> 38:40.650
Kerissa, I know Grace is preaching this
morning,

38:40.684 --> 38:42.618
and aren't we all
looking forward to that?

38:43.353 --> 38:46.022
But I have my own little
message for you two.

38:46.306 --> 38:47.521
What's that?

38:48.959 --> 38:51.419
Let not your heart be troubled.

38:52.629 --> 38:55.009
- About what?
- Anything.

38:55.365 --> 38:57.533
Believe in God and also in me.

38:57.567 --> 38:59.969
I have both your fortunes well in hand,

39:00.003 --> 39:02.204
and this storm will pass.

39:05.027 --> 39:07.777
The choir usually enters through this
hallway,

39:07.811 --> 39:10.146
unless we're doing something
special like Christmas,

39:10.180 --> 39:11.981
when we come down the aisle.

39:12.015 --> 39:13.883
- Oh!
- Hey.

39:13.917 --> 39:15.255
Sophia's looking for you.

39:15.289 --> 39:17.953
Carlton, this is my husband Kevin.

39:17.988 --> 39:19.689
Heard a lot about you.

39:19.723 --> 39:21.424
Your wife is my new best friend.

39:21.458 --> 39:22.758
I hope that's going to be okay.

39:22.793 --> 39:23.993
Please, take her off my hands.

39:24.027 --> 39:26.162
Kevin is director of outreach.

39:26.196 --> 39:27.863
And soon to be daddy of two.

39:27.898 --> 39:29.303
Yeah, that's what she tells me.

39:29.328 --> 39:31.777
Well, those babies are going to
be on the cover of something...

39:31.811 --> 39:34.270
"Baby Ebony," "Baby Essence"...

39:34.304 --> 39:35.438
because between the two of you,

39:35.472 --> 39:36.806
you have cornered the market

39:36.840 --> 39:38.887
on all sorts of human attractiveness.

39:40.444 --> 39:42.144
Thank you for being good.

39:42.179 --> 39:44.046
Come with me and I'll introduce you

39:44.081 --> 39:45.854
to your new favorite soloist.

39:45.889 --> 39:48.508
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you, too.

40:37.234 --> 40:38.467
Amen!

40:50.213 --> 40:53.015
- Morning, Calvary.
- Morning!

40:53.049 --> 40:55.351
Thank you for welcoming
my daughter and me back.

40:55.878 --> 40:57.231
It's good to be home,

40:58.221 --> 40:59.687
back with my church family.

41:05.486 --> 41:07.029
Well, let's get into the Word.

41:07.063 --> 41:12.030
My scripture today is Matthew 6:28.

41:12.869 --> 41:14.837
This is where Jesus
exhorts His followers

41:14.871 --> 41:16.879
to consider the lilies.

41:18.675 --> 41:19.942
It's a familiar passage.

41:21.678 --> 41:22.978
My sister Faith used to
teach it all the time

41:23.013 --> 41:24.246
in Little Saints.

41:24.912 --> 41:27.046
But it's one that bears
a second look, I think.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.159
You know what, Church?

41:40.163 --> 41:41.336
You know what?

41:42.392 --> 41:43.639
Scratch that.

41:45.101 --> 41:46.802
I'm suddenly not feeling
that so much anymore.

41:48.905 --> 41:49.975
Mmm.

41:50.707 --> 41:51.874
The Holy Spirit is leading me

41:51.908 --> 41:53.108
in a different direction.

41:53.443 --> 41:55.592
Come on with me, Old Testament.

41:56.240 --> 41:59.849
Job 3:26.

42:03.320 --> 42:05.363
"I am not at rest.

42:07.290 --> 42:09.112
nor am I quiet."
