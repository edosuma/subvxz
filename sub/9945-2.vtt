WEBVTT

00:06.609 --> 00:11.619
Chickies, this way for the [inaudible] Express.

00:11.724 --> 00:16.804
All this making a mess of the lives they were given

00:16.908 --> 00:21.535
by [inaudible],, and kids they're convinced

00:21.640 --> 00:23.449
aren't actually theirs.

00:23.553 --> 00:28.180
What sounds on earth could ever replace kids needing money.

00:28.285 --> 00:32.773
A why and a face, because this people reckon, and me included,

00:32.877 --> 00:36.495
is why pubs and drugs were kindly

00:36.600 --> 00:40.358
invented to calm us all down.

00:40.462 --> 00:44.671
Stop us, called mental, these are [inaudible] states,

00:44.776 --> 00:49.333
basic essentials [inaudible] are worth every penny.

00:49.439 --> 00:55.701
[inaudible] you pay the taxes.

00:59.145 --> 01:02.276
Imagine a Britain without chaps with walking

01:02.381 --> 01:05.895
in who come on your face with the price of a beer.

01:05.999 --> 01:07.147
[inaudible]

01:12.922 --> 01:14.245
cheaper drugs now.

01:23.847 --> 01:28.544
You know what they say, a change is as good as a rest.

01:28.649 --> 01:30.562
Well, who's they?

01:30.666 --> 01:33.067
Never really been into all that philosophy bollocks,

01:33.171 --> 01:34.354
if I'm honest.

01:34.459 --> 01:35.885
Mom says it's because I'm the type

01:35.989 --> 01:38.147
what calls a spade a spade.

01:38.251 --> 01:41.069
What the fuck else you gonna call it?

01:41.174 --> 01:44.305
Sometimes, you just wake up and want to do something different,

01:44.409 --> 01:46.566
and you've got to go with it.

01:46.671 --> 01:49.836
Because if you ignore it, you get fucking nowhere.

01:49.941 --> 01:52.689
I've got something to tell you.

01:52.794 --> 01:54.011
Sounds ominous.

01:54.116 --> 01:57.038
I don't want you to judge me or disown me.

01:57.143 --> 01:59.647
Somebody's been watching too much Jeremy Kyle.

01:59.753 --> 02:02.013
I'm serious.

02:02.117 --> 02:04.519
I just need to get it out in the open,

02:04.623 --> 02:06.606
saves any sneaking about or bullshit.

02:26.159 --> 02:27.029
College?

02:27.133 --> 02:28.978
Study? You?

02:29.082 --> 02:30.021
I knew this would happen.

02:30.126 --> 02:31.100
And what about the business?

02:31.204 --> 02:32.317
It's only part time.

02:32.422 --> 02:35.483
Studying what exactly?

02:35.587 --> 02:36.561
Film.

02:36.667 --> 02:38.058
And who's going to pay for that?

02:38.162 --> 02:38.823
I will.

02:38.927 --> 02:40.772
A qualification, like?

02:40.876 --> 02:42.233
Obviously.

02:42.337 --> 02:44.356
To think we fought all our lives

02:44.460 --> 02:46.095
to bring you up right, son, for you

02:46.199 --> 02:48.148
to just go throw it all back in our faces

02:48.252 --> 02:49.679
by turning to education.

02:52.810 --> 02:54.689
Karen?

02:54.793 --> 02:57.332
Karen?

02:57.437 --> 02:59.524
Where's me shin pads?

02:59.629 --> 03:00.499
Karen?

03:00.603 --> 03:01.717
I'm busy.

03:01.821 --> 03:02.691
Well, have you seen them?

03:02.795 --> 03:04.013
Well, have you looked?

03:04.117 --> 03:04.812
Yeah.

03:04.917 --> 03:06.830
Can't find them anywhere.

03:06.935 --> 03:08.640
Since when did I become your mom?

03:08.744 --> 03:09.962
Oh, forget it.

03:10.067 --> 03:11.527
You can't even walk properly out of here.

03:11.632 --> 03:13.615
Here's me working my tits off trying to sort this party

03:13.719 --> 03:15.285
and all you can think about is forte.

03:15.390 --> 03:16.712
You're paying people to help you.

03:19.391 --> 03:20.260
It'll be fine.

03:20.364 --> 03:22.209
It won't be fine.

03:22.313 --> 03:24.748
You can't just keep burying your head in the sand.

03:24.852 --> 03:25.966
What do you want me to do?

03:26.070 --> 03:28.436
Make more effort. That'd be a start.

03:32.889 --> 03:33.795
Debbie?

03:33.899 --> 03:36.856
Debbie?

03:36.960 --> 03:39.048
Please?

03:39.152 --> 03:40.370
Please, come on.

03:40.474 --> 03:41.796
Just a fiver.

03:41.901 --> 03:43.361
The last time, promise.

03:43.467 --> 03:45.172
It's always last time, promise.

03:45.276 --> 03:47.780
Oh, come on, I'm doing me bit for the credit crunch.

03:47.885 --> 03:50.877
You still owe me a tener from Tuesday.

03:53.939 --> 03:55.331
Hey, how's it go?

03:55.435 --> 03:56.930
The only man who sticks close to you

03:57.035 --> 04:00.654
in adversity other than a friend is a creditor.

04:00.758 --> 04:01.489
Don't talk shit.

04:01.593 --> 04:03.785
Yeah, but you're my daughter.

04:03.889 --> 04:06.985
You're far closer than any friend of mine.

04:11.474 --> 04:12.830
You haven't got any friends, Dad.

04:16.901 --> 04:19.754
Is that clown harassing you?

04:19.858 --> 04:21.389
Nothing I can't handle.

04:30.470 --> 04:33.845
It was my mate what made me come.

04:33.949 --> 04:34.784
He's gone away.

04:38.472 --> 04:41.881
It's made me realize, you've got to grab stuff while you can.

04:41.986 --> 04:43.516
You know, go for it.

04:43.622 --> 04:47.100
And when you watch a film, well, that takes you away,

04:47.204 --> 04:48.284
doesn't it?

04:48.388 --> 04:51.311
So I thought I'll try this.

04:51.415 --> 04:56.598
You know, learn something new, which is ace, isn't it?

04:56.702 --> 04:58.407
Thanks, Micky.

04:58.512 --> 04:59.869
Good to know it's not just cause you

04:59.973 --> 05:02.131
think Will Smith's [inaudible].

05:07.488 --> 05:09.541
What do you think?

05:09.646 --> 05:11.907
Stunning.

05:12.012 --> 05:15.143
I missed football practice for this.

05:15.247 --> 05:18.970
Hey, Karen, how about a stripper for the party?

05:19.074 --> 05:21.161
We could charge them more.

05:21.266 --> 05:23.631
Not bad for you.

05:23.736 --> 05:24.779
Nice move.

05:29.720 --> 05:32.017
Oh my God.

05:32.121 --> 05:34.660
What have you done?

05:34.766 --> 05:38.140
Oh, Jesus.

05:38.244 --> 05:41.167
That's a babe.

05:41.271 --> 05:42.837
Get rid of it.

05:42.941 --> 05:43.777
What?

05:43.881 --> 05:45.203
It's not mine.

05:45.307 --> 05:46.560
We should call the police.

05:46.664 --> 05:47.499
No way.

05:47.603 --> 05:48.682
They'll shut us down.

05:48.786 --> 05:49.969
Get rid of it.

05:50.074 --> 05:53.866
You get that seen to, and you take over.

06:08.653 --> 06:09.557
Homework?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.235
It's part of my assignment.

06:12.341 --> 06:14.254
An assignment?

06:14.358 --> 06:15.262
Very clever.

06:15.367 --> 06:17.107
I just want something for myself.

06:17.211 --> 06:19.855
Why do you always have to take the piss?

06:19.960 --> 06:20.829
I'm not, son.

06:20.934 --> 06:22.256
No, you've got Dad.

06:22.360 --> 06:23.543
Jamie's got the Jockey.

06:23.648 --> 06:24.726
Shane's got Kelly.

06:24.830 --> 06:25.735
Mandie's got Katie.

06:25.840 --> 06:26.883
What have I got?

06:26.988 --> 06:30.850
A few pairs of shit flickers and a pink car.

06:30.954 --> 06:31.928
Tell you the truth.

06:32.032 --> 06:34.920
I've thought about studying for years.

06:35.025 --> 06:39.861
I got to do something like this, What have you got to do then?

06:43.862 --> 06:46.296
Well, they do it in Hollywood.

06:46.402 --> 06:48.384
You've got to put the whole film into one sentence,

06:48.489 --> 06:51.481
and see if it sounds like a goer.

06:51.585 --> 06:56.561
What like, mad fuck mommy's boy gets giddy with a knife?

06:56.665 --> 07:00.666
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.

07:00.770 --> 07:02.092
Carl Gallagher?

07:07.764 --> 07:09.573
How you [inaudible] for this?

07:09.677 --> 07:11.104
Why'd you do it?

07:11.208 --> 07:13.956
Always wanted to help people.

07:14.061 --> 07:15.731
It's my vocation.

07:15.835 --> 07:17.088
You're what?

07:17.192 --> 07:18.514
Like a calling.

07:18.618 --> 07:21.297
Some jobs you just have to do.

07:21.401 --> 07:23.871
It's a very attractive personality

07:23.977 --> 07:27.003
trait, Carl, having a vocation.

07:27.108 --> 07:28.534
I'm just like that.

07:28.639 --> 07:30.517
I hope anyone be.

07:30.622 --> 07:32.187
Really?

07:32.291 --> 07:33.926
Runs in the family.

07:34.031 --> 07:36.710
Brother's abroad at the moment, ready to save the children.

07:44.678 --> 07:47.705
We're always looking for volunteers here, you know?

07:52.401 --> 07:55.254
My mouth slips off her hardened nipple,

07:55.358 --> 07:59.325
and I kissed and licked my way down her tight body.

07:59.429 --> 08:02.282
Her skin tasted like sweet vanilla,

08:02.386 --> 08:04.961
and I wanted to devour her.

08:05.066 --> 08:08.788
As I went to my knees, my fingers slipped inside as she

08:08.893 --> 08:11.711
whimpered with pure pleasure.

08:11.815 --> 08:15.538
Are you getting on?

08:15.642 --> 08:16.930
I can't do it.

08:19.573 --> 08:22.253
Classic animation is not just for children,

08:22.357 --> 08:26.080
and is an equally legitimate dramatic tool as well.

08:26.184 --> 08:27.784
Discuss.

08:27.889 --> 08:29.559
See?

08:29.663 --> 08:34.221
I tell you what this needs, a sharp, analytical mind.

08:34.325 --> 08:35.785
I'll do it for you, son.

08:43.024 --> 08:44.310
He just needs a bit of encouragement

08:44.415 --> 08:48.415
every now and then. He can be a bit stubborn.

08:48.521 --> 08:50.294
Go on, mate, your move.

08:50.399 --> 08:51.582
Stubborn?

08:51.686 --> 08:53.043
My Walter?

08:53.147 --> 08:54.678
You wouldn't know the meaning of the word, would you, love?

08:59.792 --> 09:04.629
18 or 80, you're all the same.

09:04.733 --> 09:06.820
Carl's' move.

09:06.925 --> 09:07.969
Sorry.

09:08.074 --> 09:09.360
What you apologizing to me for?

09:09.465 --> 09:11.518
Bastard's a leopard, this old timer.

09:11.622 --> 09:13.814
Keep telling him, if I were 10 years older,

09:13.918 --> 09:17.432
and he were 10 younger, we'd probably be together.

09:17.536 --> 09:19.451
We just clicked, didn't we, babes?

09:19.555 --> 09:20.911
Bollocks.

09:21.016 --> 09:21.885
Serious.

09:23.938 --> 09:25.817
Fucking [inaudible].

09:36.428 --> 09:39.212
I could just tell you a lie, or I could just be honest.

09:39.316 --> 09:41.925
You with me?

09:42.029 --> 09:43.213
Not really, Miss.

09:43.317 --> 09:48.015
You should have got my story with your assignment.

09:48.119 --> 09:49.231
That was yours?

09:49.336 --> 09:51.006
Yeah, I wrote it.

09:51.110 --> 09:57.339
I do it the side just short stories with a twist, really.

09:57.443 --> 10:00.156
Not bad.

10:00.261 --> 10:01.826
It's just a hobby.

10:01.931 --> 10:03.671
They pay me.

10:03.775 --> 10:05.270
Nice one.

10:05.375 --> 10:06.975
Getting all paid for a hobby.

10:07.079 --> 10:08.958
It's not quite as simple as that.

10:09.063 --> 10:09.759
It's just words.

10:09.864 --> 10:12.925
Can't be that hard.

10:13.029 --> 10:15.325
Have a go yourself then if you're so sure.

10:20.754 --> 10:21.902
What? Now?

10:22.006 --> 10:22.841
I'm waiting.

10:25.902 --> 10:28.998
All right.

10:29.104 --> 10:33.940
How about his thrust pumped harder as his seed

10:34.044 --> 10:36.305
boiled in his balls ready to spill

10:36.410 --> 10:39.263
out into her velvet chasm.

10:39.367 --> 10:40.932
Bloody hell.

10:41.036 --> 10:42.811
That's great, Micky.

10:42.915 --> 10:46.708
Hey, you reckon they'd pay me an all?

10:46.812 --> 10:51.057
Maybe we should go back to mine, grab a coffee.

10:51.161 --> 10:54.641
There's not much difference between his world and ours.

10:54.745 --> 10:56.414
His mother with a single parent.

10:56.519 --> 10:58.920
His father was permanently abled.

10:59.024 --> 11:02.398
Poor little bastard fucked all stability.

11:02.504 --> 11:04.834
Makes you think, doesn't it?

11:04.938 --> 11:07.340
Yes, love.

11:07.444 --> 11:09.357
We've done all right by our kids, haven't we?

11:09.462 --> 11:10.992
Of course, we have, love.

11:11.097 --> 11:14.019
Even if I did get shot, I mean at least you'd still be here.

11:14.124 --> 11:16.838
Not like that fuck out gallivanting, flashing his

11:16.942 --> 11:18.264
owns.

11:18.368 --> 11:22.544
You know, he had exactly the same shit on his plate as us.

11:22.648 --> 11:23.970
Did that bambi.

11:24.074 --> 11:28.876
I'm just popping out for a [inaudible]..

11:28.980 --> 11:30.024
OK.

11:45.019 --> 11:45.923
Hiya.

11:46.027 --> 11:46.897
Hi, love.

11:51.594 --> 11:53.682
Good day at school, Ches?

11:53.786 --> 11:55.074
Depends what you class as good.

11:59.632 --> 12:02.032
I said the wrong thing again.

12:02.136 --> 12:03.354
Come on.

12:03.458 --> 12:05.650
Really that long ago since you were his age?

12:05.754 --> 12:06.728
No.

12:06.834 --> 12:08.538
You could have made more of an effort.

12:08.643 --> 12:10.278
At least try and bond.

12:10.382 --> 12:13.443
Like I haven't been doing?

12:13.548 --> 12:15.531
I'm sick of this.

12:15.635 --> 12:18.662
All I want is a bit of harmony.

12:18.766 --> 12:19.810
You're both male.

12:19.914 --> 12:22.350
You must have something in common?

12:40.651 --> 12:41.486
Jaime?

12:50.357 --> 12:53.072
We've hardly gotten anything to say anymore.

12:53.176 --> 12:54.428
Went to this guy, we baby oil.

12:54.532 --> 12:56.864
He's getting right on my nerves.

12:56.968 --> 12:58.569
Never quite got that.

12:58.673 --> 13:01.073
Rubbing up a complete stranger.

13:01.178 --> 13:04.066
Well, some of these women haven't had a shag in 10 years.

13:04.170 --> 13:05.492
So?

13:05.597 --> 13:08.171
So they pay me a fiver for a ticket to see a bit of cock.

13:08.275 --> 13:11.163
There's no crime in wanting to break the routine.

13:11.268 --> 13:13.216
Seven year itch already?

13:13.320 --> 13:16.451
It just all seems a bit flat.

13:16.555 --> 13:19.270
Karen, I found an article.

13:19.374 --> 13:22.853
The previous landlord was shacked up here with some bird

13:22.958 --> 13:24.732
that topped herself.

13:24.837 --> 13:27.237
Gloria someone.

13:27.341 --> 13:28.559
Guess why?

13:28.663 --> 13:30.681
Why, Norma?

13:30.785 --> 13:34.021
She never got over the death of her baby.

13:34.125 --> 13:36.178
Everyone has bad patches.

13:36.282 --> 13:38.544
It will pass, you know.

13:38.648 --> 13:39.728
Keep hoping it will.

13:39.832 --> 13:42.198
Things will just perk right back up.

13:42.302 --> 13:43.484
You two are solid.

13:43.589 --> 13:46.790
You'll just ride it.

13:46.894 --> 13:48.460
Who says I want to though?

13:54.617 --> 13:55.835
She'll calm down.

13:55.940 --> 13:59.036
Best if I just keep out of her way for a bit, Dad.

13:59.141 --> 14:00.254
You know what women are like.

14:00.359 --> 14:01.437
Indeed, I do, son.

14:01.541 --> 14:02.585
What are you doing here?

14:02.690 --> 14:04.951
Giving the misses a wide berth.

14:05.055 --> 14:06.900
He's having a breather.

14:07.004 --> 14:08.222
Terrible?

14:08.326 --> 14:09.508
Yeah, sort of.

14:09.614 --> 14:10.656
Morning, Hitchcock.

14:10.762 --> 14:12.188
She finally kicked you out then?

14:12.292 --> 14:14.554
You're not getting a divorce, are you?

14:14.658 --> 14:15.528
What the fuck?

14:15.632 --> 14:16.467
No.

14:16.572 --> 14:17.790
It's nothing.

14:17.894 --> 14:19.494
It's just you know how it is when everything you do

14:19.599 --> 14:20.294
is wrong.

14:20.398 --> 14:21.790
Where's your spine?

14:21.895 --> 14:23.808
You sound like a right puff.

14:23.912 --> 14:26.104
He's right, for once.

14:26.208 --> 14:27.496
Pussyfooting won't get you anywhere.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.470
Take the upper hand.

14:28.574 --> 14:29.966
Act like a man for a change.

14:30.071 --> 14:30.906
Show them who's boss.

14:31.010 --> 14:32.681
They love that.

14:32.785 --> 14:35.985
You're a Maguire, balls of steel, like your father.

14:36.090 --> 14:37.517
Cocopuffs, sweetheart?

14:41.343 --> 14:44.405
Lose the sock, Pablo.

14:44.509 --> 14:47.606
It's not Pablo really, is it?

14:47.710 --> 14:48.545
No.

14:48.650 --> 14:49.693
Alan.

14:49.798 --> 14:51.989
And you're not from Rio de Janeiro?

14:52.094 --> 14:54.181
Wiggin, actually.

14:54.285 --> 14:55.121
Sorry.

14:58.635 --> 14:59.540
See ya.

15:03.088 --> 15:04.480
No one wants to see that.

15:04.584 --> 15:06.776
It was your idea in the first place.

15:06.880 --> 15:08.515
- I meant a bird. - Typical.

15:08.620 --> 15:10.673
The women around here are going to love that.

15:10.777 --> 15:11.786
Aren't they, girls?

15:11.891 --> 15:13.004
We're supposed to be bringing people in,

15:13.108 --> 15:14.604
not driving them away.

15:14.709 --> 15:16.691
Like I don't know that, after all the work that I've done.

15:16.797 --> 15:18.500
You're not the only one who's been grafting.

15:18.606 --> 15:22.362
You have painted a wall, Jamie.

15:22.467 --> 15:23.511
Nothing's enough, is it?

15:31.409 --> 15:32.591
Thanks.

15:32.696 --> 15:34.296
Shit's not one of my strong points.

15:37.740 --> 15:39.202
You're supposed to be on the ward.

15:39.307 --> 15:40.697
Poor lad just needs easing in.

15:40.803 --> 15:42.298
I think he can look after himself.

15:42.402 --> 15:43.586
Can you, Carl? - Yeah.

15:43.690 --> 15:44.942
Shift it, you.

15:45.047 --> 15:47.238
All those wasted years at charm school, huh?

15:47.343 --> 15:50.718
Listen, lady, if those beds aren't done by 1:00,

15:50.822 --> 15:52.457
it's me who gets it in the neck.

15:52.561 --> 15:55.484
And I won't be taking the rap for some two bit auxiliary,

15:55.588 --> 15:56.354
all right?

15:56.459 --> 15:57.711
Don't talk to her like that.

15:57.816 --> 15:58.790
Excuse me?

15:58.894 --> 16:00.007
- Leave it, Carl. - No.

16:00.112 --> 16:01.260
What right she got?

16:01.364 --> 16:03.139
I must admit, Carl, I thought you were

16:03.243 --> 16:05.539
a man of more seasoned taste.

16:05.643 --> 16:06.478
You know what?

16:06.583 --> 16:07.731
Fuck off.

16:07.835 --> 16:09.854
You stick this shit job, [inaudible]..

16:15.072 --> 16:18.969
Carl, thanks for sticking up for me.

16:19.073 --> 16:21.057
I should have just got on with the job.

16:21.161 --> 16:22.205
Well in there.

16:28.746 --> 16:31.773
Have you talked to her?

16:31.877 --> 16:35.147
So she can tell me again how shit I am?

16:35.251 --> 16:37.374
Can't do right for doing wrong, Dad.

16:37.478 --> 16:38.522
It's relentless.

16:38.626 --> 16:41.583
I just want to scream at him all the time.

16:41.688 --> 16:43.428
You are good natured, too, underneath.

16:43.532 --> 16:45.758
That's got to count for something.

16:45.863 --> 16:47.359
No.

16:47.463 --> 16:50.212
Wrong time of the month, that's all it will be.

16:50.316 --> 16:52.716
You do love him, don't you?

16:52.822 --> 16:53.830
Not as much as I can hate him.

16:53.934 --> 16:57.379
And I feel like I could kill him.

16:57.484 --> 17:01.867
Might actually pick up a knife and slash his throat.

17:01.971 --> 17:03.119
That bad?

17:03.224 --> 17:04.894
Have you checked the tides?

17:04.998 --> 17:06.529
You're talking shit, Dad.

17:06.633 --> 17:09.765
All my life, leave the box seat open

17:09.868 --> 17:11.400
at our house on a full moon, and your mother

17:11.503 --> 17:12.653
turns into a screaming banshee.

17:12.757 --> 17:15.435
But he's romantic [inaudible].

17:15.540 --> 17:18.358
Novelty soon wears off.

17:18.463 --> 17:24.934
He couldn't give a shit anymore about me or this place.

17:25.038 --> 17:27.647
I don't get it.

17:27.752 --> 17:28.622
It's marriage, son.

17:28.726 --> 17:31.197
You're not supposed to.

17:31.301 --> 17:33.318
I think I'm losing him, Kelly.

17:49.776 --> 17:50.645
What you think?

17:55.690 --> 17:56.803
Where'd you get this?

17:56.908 --> 17:58.717
Perks of the job, that's all.

17:58.821 --> 18:00.526
It's for you.

18:00.630 --> 18:02.196
Wouldn't have been my first choice.

18:08.006 --> 18:08.841
Anyway--

18:18.582 --> 18:22.515
Years I made Shane wear that patch to sort out his squint.

18:22.619 --> 18:25.646
That's all she was doing for Tom, babe.

18:25.750 --> 18:28.116
How is it her fault he's got big fuck off ears?

18:28.220 --> 18:29.090
Is

18:29.194 --> 18:30.342
Malls, sweetheart.

18:30.446 --> 18:32.117
And when she sticks up for him,

18:32.221 --> 18:34.935
he gets even more shit, because they've

18:35.040 --> 18:38.241
branded him mom a naughty.

18:38.345 --> 18:41.823
How'd you ever get over that sort of thing?

18:41.928 --> 18:44.329
Imagine it.

18:44.433 --> 18:46.138
All rise, it's Spielberg.

18:46.242 --> 18:47.286
All right.

18:50.069 --> 18:52.052
B. - B?

18:52.157 --> 18:57.375
I got a B. Did you hear that, Paddy?

19:01.655 --> 19:03.185
[knocking]

19:09.309 --> 19:11.257
Fuck me, you look nice.

19:11.362 --> 19:14.632
Good job I do, because you're taking me out.

19:14.737 --> 19:15.398
Hiya.

19:15.502 --> 19:17.764
Hi

19:17.868 --> 19:20.442
Least you can do, since I saved you from the clutches

19:20.547 --> 19:21.834
of that silly boot.

19:21.939 --> 19:23.748
This is Maxine.

19:23.852 --> 19:25.975
Oh, hiya.

19:26.079 --> 19:27.714
She yours?

19:27.818 --> 19:28.688
Yeah.

19:28.792 --> 19:29.697
Won't be a sec.

19:29.802 --> 19:31.576
Can I have this one, ma'am?

19:31.681 --> 19:34.638
You look amazing for a bird that's just sprogged.

19:34.742 --> 19:37.525
Oh, thanks.

19:37.629 --> 19:39.752
Norma, what are you doing?

19:39.856 --> 19:40.726
Not.

19:58.748 --> 20:01.810
Get your coat, and you've pulled.

20:01.914 --> 20:04.037
Auntie Julie is into all this.

20:04.141 --> 20:05.393
She sells door to door.

20:05.498 --> 20:07.759
You should see boot of the car, boxes full of creams.

20:07.864 --> 20:09.116
What creams?

20:09.220 --> 20:11.934
Anti-wrinkle, anti-blackhead, anti-cellulite.

20:12.039 --> 20:13.987
Auntie Julie's got a cream for it.

20:14.092 --> 20:15.378
Anti-cellulite?

20:15.483 --> 20:16.596
Amazing.

20:16.701 --> 20:18.824
Honest.

20:18.928 --> 20:21.015
See?

20:21.120 --> 20:22.093
So where you off?

20:22.198 --> 20:23.067
Just the Jockey.

20:23.172 --> 20:24.390
Got a bit of a do on.

20:24.494 --> 20:25.503
Dressed like that?

20:25.607 --> 20:26.512
They've done it all up.

20:26.617 --> 20:27.660
About bloody time.

20:27.765 --> 20:29.191
Love a good do, me.

20:29.295 --> 20:30.374
We'll all go, shall we?

20:30.478 --> 20:31.557
What's that smell?

20:31.661 --> 20:33.018
It's not me, it's Carl.

20:45.230 --> 20:46.100
Hiya, mate.

20:46.204 --> 20:47.318
Hiya.

20:47.422 --> 20:49.335
This is job, new footy captain.

20:49.440 --> 20:50.797
Hi.

20:50.901 --> 20:51.736
Hi.

20:51.841 --> 20:53.684
I'm De.

20:53.789 --> 20:56.467
[music playing]

21:01.304 --> 21:05.931
They avoid me and [inaudible] a drink a beer.

21:06.035 --> 21:06.905
A pint.

21:07.009 --> 21:08.924
He's just doing his job.

21:09.028 --> 21:09.967
With a lap dancer?

21:10.072 --> 21:12.472
Dancing?

21:12.576 --> 21:16.160
Off, off, off, off, off.

21:16.264 --> 21:19.674
Time's up.

21:19.778 --> 21:21.726
Yeah, is this lively?

21:21.831 --> 21:22.944
It's lively.

21:26.389 --> 21:28.511
We're losing customers, Karen.

21:28.615 --> 21:30.181
Sling it.

21:30.286 --> 21:31.120
Fuck it.

21:31.225 --> 21:32.269
Turn it off.

21:35.156 --> 21:35.991
See?

21:36.096 --> 21:37.452
So it's gone a bit wrong.

21:37.556 --> 21:39.366
It's a total disaster, Karen.

21:39.471 --> 21:41.106
We're busy, aren't we?

21:41.210 --> 21:43.332
You should've listened.

21:43.436 --> 21:44.828
One piddly suggestion, Jaime.

21:44.933 --> 21:47.925
This took a lot more than that to put this lot off.

21:48.029 --> 21:50.151
It's not my fault nobody wants to see it.

21:50.256 --> 21:51.856
Well, some of them do.

21:51.960 --> 21:53.248
(SINGING) How'd you like it?

21:53.352 --> 21:54.256
How'd you like it?

21:54.361 --> 21:55.266
More, more, more.

21:55.370 --> 21:56.831
No more gagging for it.

21:56.936 --> 21:59.406
I just wanted everyone to have a good night.

21:59.511 --> 22:01.006
Well, I'm having a good night.

22:04.868 --> 22:06.573
Well, most were that desperate, they'd

22:06.677 --> 22:08.243
pay to watch anything strip.

22:12.801 --> 22:13.949
I'm sorry about that, everyone.

22:14.053 --> 22:15.376
If you can just be patient with me,

22:15.480 --> 22:16.906
I'll have some more entertainment

22:17.010 --> 22:20.629
sorted in a minute.

22:20.733 --> 22:23.343
[music playing]

22:25.360 --> 22:26.891
That's more like it.

22:47.349 --> 22:48.253
Moral support.

22:48.358 --> 22:50.515
She's She's smart, that one.

23:00.396 --> 23:02.797
Go on, you.

23:02.901 --> 23:04.640
[inaudible] down.

23:04.745 --> 23:06.067
Whoa, Neddie.

23:06.171 --> 23:07.529
Dad, I'm not 10.

23:07.633 --> 23:09.581
I'm not your little girl anymore.

23:12.608 --> 23:15.148
Suffice the requirements, Lillian.

23:22.314 --> 23:25.028
What good am I for her these days?

23:25.133 --> 23:26.525
She'll come around.

23:26.629 --> 23:28.125
I was the same at her age.

23:28.230 --> 23:31.187
Like a little controllable tiger.

23:31.291 --> 23:32.926
I'm no different now, if I'm honest.

23:43.676 --> 23:44.756
Hello, boys.

23:55.610 --> 23:56.968
Debbie?

23:57.072 --> 23:58.881
Sorry. I've got a date.

23:58.985 --> 24:00.899
Oh.

24:01.003 --> 24:02.291
So have you.

24:02.395 --> 24:05.178
So true.

24:05.282 --> 24:07.684
My kind of bird.

24:07.788 --> 24:09.283
Back to mine?

24:09.387 --> 24:11.893
What for?

24:11.997 --> 24:12.867
Coffee.

24:12.971 --> 24:13.981
Coffee?

24:28.106 --> 24:29.463
Ow.

24:29.567 --> 24:30.506
Oh, sorry.

24:30.611 --> 24:31.550
Are you all right?

24:31.654 --> 24:33.185
Sh. sh Keep going.

24:39.343 --> 24:41.014
She's built like a brick shithouse,

24:41.118 --> 24:42.545
and she's grabbing hold of him like this.

24:42.649 --> 24:44.702
And she's got these big hands, like fella's hands,

24:44.806 --> 24:48.285
all big and veiny, and she's shouting right at me.

24:48.390 --> 24:49.885
I'd have told her to sling it.

24:49.989 --> 24:51.938
[inaudible].

24:52.043 --> 24:53.435
Hi, babes.

24:53.539 --> 24:54.374
Toast?

25:10.065 --> 25:10.900
Jamie.

25:15.596 --> 25:17.580
Stop following me.

25:17.684 --> 25:19.841
We're bound to bump into each other.

25:19.945 --> 25:21.512
Sitting in a car, watching me isn't us

25:21.616 --> 25:22.694
bumping into each other.

25:22.798 --> 25:25.094
But this is.

25:25.199 --> 25:26.869
Well, just stay away.

25:26.973 --> 25:30.313
You should be with me enjoying yourself, not bringing her up.

25:30.417 --> 25:32.715
I'm not bringing her up.

25:32.819 --> 25:35.080
You're old before your time, Debs.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.142
At least when you were with me, we had fun, didn't we?

25:38.246 --> 25:39.255
Don't kid yourself, Grandad.

25:46.109 --> 25:50.076
[interposing voices]

25:50.180 --> 25:53.415
Hey, break it up.

25:53.520 --> 25:55.886
Now.

25:55.990 --> 25:57.521
You fight the girls, huh?

25:57.625 --> 25:59.956
He was helping me to [inaudible]..

26:00.061 --> 26:01.730
She took it!

26:01.835 --> 26:02.739
They've got my MP3 player.

26:02.844 --> 26:03.887
Look at my face.

26:03.992 --> 26:05.384
She nearly scratched my eyes out.

26:05.488 --> 26:07.158
- What's going on, Meena? - Yeah, that's right.

26:07.263 --> 26:09.315
Take their side. You're all the same.

26:09.419 --> 26:10.463
It's not about sides.

26:10.568 --> 26:11.959
You're committing a public order offense,

26:12.063 --> 26:15.508
not to mention assault. Now, clear off, you two.

26:15.613 --> 26:17.178
See, that's it.

26:17.282 --> 26:18.326
Let the white girls go.

26:18.430 --> 26:19.474
That's enough.

26:19.579 --> 26:21.527
Schoolies too, just your type.

26:21.631 --> 26:22.779
Why you so angry, yeah?

26:22.883 --> 26:24.137
I've seen what it's like for you.

26:24.241 --> 26:26.224
You don't go short, you spoiled little bastard.

26:26.329 --> 26:28.937
It's got nothing to do with color.

26:29.042 --> 26:32.104
We just expect this bollocks from you.

26:32.208 --> 26:33.217
Come on.

26:33.321 --> 26:34.574
We'll sort it down at the station, yeah?

26:40.245 --> 26:42.750
She was desperate to get hold of it once more.

26:42.854 --> 26:44.768
It wasn't the longest she'd seen,

26:44.872 --> 26:46.821
but the fact that she couldn't get her hand around it

26:46.925 --> 26:47.795
told the story.

26:50.926 --> 26:53.396
They couldn't wait a minute longer.

26:53.501 --> 26:57.189
She reached for his belt, as he tore off her shirt.

26:57.293 --> 26:58.789
But she ain't wearing a bra, is she?

26:58.893 --> 26:59.763
No.

26:59.867 --> 27:01.259
Dirty bitch.

27:01.364 --> 27:06.408
She looks up at his chest all glistening with sweat.

27:06.512 --> 27:09.748
His abs and full pecs rolling up and down

27:09.852 --> 27:11.661
with his deep manly breathing.

27:11.767 --> 27:14.480
You're making us wait, aren't ya?

27:14.584 --> 27:15.419
Yeah.

27:15.524 --> 27:16.393
Criminal.

27:18.829 --> 27:22.239
She drowned him down, faster and harder.

27:22.343 --> 27:25.022
He bit on her erect nipple as the blood rushed

27:25.126 --> 27:27.318
excitedly into with dick. - Cock.

27:27.423 --> 27:28.118
Cock.

27:28.223 --> 27:29.545
Does he fuck her then?

27:29.649 --> 27:30.519
Yeah.

27:30.623 --> 27:31.284
How?

27:31.388 --> 27:33.546
Up the ass?

27:33.650 --> 27:35.773
I meant from behind.

27:35.877 --> 27:38.799
I absolutely love it doggy.

27:38.904 --> 27:42.244
I think I'd prefer if these two were face to face.

27:47.741 --> 27:48.645
Hey, doll.

27:53.690 --> 27:54.351
Grow up.

27:54.455 --> 27:55.987
It's just my tits.

27:56.091 --> 27:57.413
I kept them drinking, didn't I?

27:57.518 --> 27:58.492
It's not just that.

27:58.596 --> 28:00.996
What is it?

28:01.100 --> 28:02.979
Everything.

28:03.084 --> 28:04.684
All this.

28:04.788 --> 28:07.920
It's a constant battle.

28:08.024 --> 28:09.312
Doesn't last long, does it?

28:09.416 --> 28:10.947
What?

28:11.051 --> 28:12.547
The honeymoon.

28:12.652 --> 28:14.008
Karen?

28:14.113 --> 28:15.504
What, Norma?

28:15.609 --> 28:19.123
Googled the artist blog, he did 15 years for murder.

28:19.228 --> 28:20.480
So?

28:20.584 --> 28:22.081
He probably did away with the both of them.

28:22.185 --> 28:24.515
If I can find out where he is, he might be able to tell us

28:24.620 --> 28:25.663
about Gloria's baby.

28:25.768 --> 28:27.682
Gloria's fucking baby.

28:27.786 --> 28:29.247
Oh, calm down.

28:29.352 --> 28:30.674
Just want closure, Karen.

28:30.778 --> 28:31.822
Have you heard yourself?

28:31.926 --> 28:33.248
Who the fuck is Gloria?

28:33.352 --> 28:35.093
And I thought I told you to dump the fucking baby?

28:35.197 --> 28:39.024
So why haven't you dumped the fucking baby?

28:39.128 --> 28:40.937
Just want closure.

28:44.521 --> 28:46.260
Look at her.

28:46.364 --> 28:49.287
You two should a night out.

28:49.391 --> 28:51.688
Not with this place, doubt it.

28:51.793 --> 28:53.985
Well, I can cover for ya.

28:54.089 --> 28:55.202
One night wouldn't hurt.

28:57.881 --> 28:59.969
Told you.

29:00.073 --> 29:01.986
I could stay over, if you like?

29:02.091 --> 29:05.466
You could have lit one.

29:05.570 --> 29:06.648
Would ya?

29:06.753 --> 29:07.588
Course.

29:10.232 --> 29:13.886
We should do something.

29:13.990 --> 29:17.782
Put one of them in loo's if you want.

29:17.887 --> 29:20.148
Here I come.

29:20.252 --> 29:22.236
Payday.

29:22.340 --> 29:24.218
Hey, top night.

29:30.342 --> 29:32.255
Keep your eyes up, pal.

29:32.359 --> 29:33.369
Jaime.

29:43.388 --> 29:44.954
Oh, here he comes.

29:45.059 --> 29:48.851
PC Patronizing.

29:48.955 --> 29:50.207
Listen, kids.

29:50.312 --> 29:53.165
It's his fault we're here in the first place.

29:53.270 --> 29:54.348
That's not fair.

29:54.452 --> 29:55.809
Where did you get the MP3 player?

29:55.913 --> 29:56.574
Lost property box?

29:56.680 --> 29:58.279
You're all snides.

29:58.383 --> 30:00.819
Give it a rest for a minute, Chesney.

30:00.923 --> 30:02.489
I've had a word with the sarge.

30:02.594 --> 30:03.463
So?

30:03.568 --> 30:05.238
I'm taking you home.

30:05.342 --> 30:06.977
So you can grass to Mom.

30:07.082 --> 30:09.239
- Why would I do that? - Because you're a copper.

30:12.266 --> 30:14.214
And make things even tougher for myself?

30:21.973 --> 30:24.513
This is brilliant.

30:24.617 --> 30:26.217
Cheers, mate.

30:26.322 --> 30:27.714
Good enough to submit now?

30:27.818 --> 30:29.661
Definitely.

30:29.766 --> 30:30.705
Where to?

30:30.809 --> 30:32.062
Online.

30:32.167 --> 30:33.594
There's a few different sites depending

30:33.698 --> 30:34.880
on what you're good at.

30:34.984 --> 30:37.107
What like?

30:37.212 --> 30:44.657
Couples, swingers, animals, gay.

30:44.761 --> 30:47.092
Wanna stick around for a beer?

30:47.197 --> 30:50.780
I am genuinely sorry you think I've been ignoring you.

30:53.633 --> 30:56.486
But don't think of me badly, please?

30:56.590 --> 30:58.156
We need each other.

30:58.261 --> 30:59.826
Because things are going to be better

30:59.930 --> 31:03.480
from now on for both of us.

31:03.584 --> 31:07.585
I mean, we can join forces, kid.

31:07.689 --> 31:09.428
You and me versus the world.

31:12.838 --> 31:15.899
Hey, our special pact.

31:16.005 --> 31:16.909
Debbie?

31:17.013 --> 31:18.196
Yeah?

31:18.301 --> 31:19.727
What you think you're playing at?

31:19.831 --> 31:20.875
What?

31:20.979 --> 31:22.023
Arranging to go out with my bird.

31:22.127 --> 31:23.554
It's just a drink.

31:23.658 --> 31:25.850
I was going to take her out tonight.

31:25.954 --> 31:27.937
Oh, you're not jealous are ya?

31:28.042 --> 31:28.877
I'm a fuck.

31:33.713 --> 31:36.601
Promise me you'll always be there for me.

31:47.178 --> 31:49.961
One thing get asked on, Paddy, has made me look at life

31:50.065 --> 31:51.735
from an animal's perspective.

31:51.839 --> 31:52.953
Fuck "Badger Watch."

31:53.057 --> 31:53.927
That's just boring.

32:00.225 --> 32:03.808
Just a splash of color and a squeaky voice, and that's it.

32:03.912 --> 32:05.130
You're there.

32:05.234 --> 32:07.496
I could go on forever about this, Patrick.

32:07.600 --> 32:09.131
For infinity.

32:09.236 --> 32:12.889
You see, now I know how it must have felt for Buzz Lightyear.

32:12.993 --> 32:15.741
- Mimi, would you do me a favor? - Yeah.

32:15.846 --> 32:16.959
And shut the fuck up?

32:20.926 --> 32:23.430
He like us.

32:23.535 --> 32:24.961
He's bright. [toilet flushing]

32:25.065 --> 32:25.970
He's cute.

32:28.928 --> 32:31.676
Your very own prodigy.

32:31.780 --> 32:33.764
Imagine.

32:33.868 --> 32:35.434
You reckon he's game?

32:35.538 --> 32:36.617
I know he is.

32:42.044 --> 32:47.228
Micky, [inaudible],, ever heard of a fuck buddy?

32:54.395 --> 32:55.508
Is anyone home?

33:06.086 --> 33:07.059
What's going on in there then?

33:07.164 --> 33:08.451
It's just a stew.

33:12.800 --> 33:15.375
Day at school, Ches?

33:15.479 --> 33:17.567
Yes, great.

33:17.671 --> 33:18.575
Well, then.

33:22.055 --> 33:23.585
I didn't think you had it in ya.

33:23.690 --> 33:24.525
Piece of piss.

33:30.892 --> 33:34.510
[music playing]

34:17.791 --> 34:20.818
1, 2, 3, go.

34:37.413 --> 34:40.440
Patrolling grease monkey at 3 o'clock.

34:40.545 --> 34:45.625
Oh, he's old enough to be my dad.

34:45.728 --> 34:48.338
He just took his wedding ring off.

34:48.442 --> 34:50.842
Oh, the slime ball.

34:50.947 --> 34:53.105
No harm in getting a drink out of it.

35:27.722 --> 35:30.192
Read him the riot act, didn't I?

35:30.296 --> 35:34.159
He'll forgive a flashy tit if it means we're back on track.

35:34.263 --> 35:36.212
And are you?

35:36.316 --> 35:37.220
What?

35:37.325 --> 35:39.239
Back on track.

35:39.343 --> 35:40.213
Sort of.

35:43.170 --> 35:45.675
Do you always do that?

35:45.780 --> 35:47.693
What?

35:47.797 --> 35:49.711
Pout.

35:49.815 --> 35:51.902
No.

35:52.007 --> 35:53.155
Do you know what?

35:53.259 --> 35:54.094
What?

35:57.121 --> 36:00.671
I think you're a dead fig.

36:11.908 --> 36:12.813
Fuck off.

36:25.094 --> 36:26.799
She's been following me around.

36:26.903 --> 36:29.513
Yeah, that's not good.

36:29.617 --> 36:30.974
Nightmare.

36:31.078 --> 36:34.488
She's around every corner.

36:34.592 --> 36:37.549
Soon I was clinging with my first big split.

36:37.653 --> 36:41.273
Something a bit pathetic about all that though.

36:41.377 --> 36:42.421
Don't you think?

36:46.003 --> 36:47.708
I thought you were really good today.

37:28.763 --> 37:29.702
[inaudible]!

37:36.035 --> 37:37.391
Go, go, go, go.

37:37.496 --> 37:39.549
Give me my fucking wallet.

37:39.653 --> 37:40.523
Shit.

38:00.250 --> 38:01.119
Freak.

38:07.938 --> 38:11.208
All right, it should have been a woman.

38:11.313 --> 38:12.635
Can someone tape this?

38:12.739 --> 38:13.957
Yeah, say it again.

38:14.061 --> 38:15.732
It doesn't matter now.

38:15.836 --> 38:16.880
It's history.

38:16.984 --> 38:19.246
Yeah, and it were a top night in the end.

38:19.350 --> 38:20.672
Does that mean I get an apology?

38:20.776 --> 38:23.246
Oh, this I will have to film.

38:23.351 --> 38:27.700
I am the first to apologize when I've done something wrong.

38:27.804 --> 38:29.787
Did you get that?

38:29.892 --> 38:31.179
Leave it, Shane.

38:31.284 --> 38:32.502
Leave it, Jamie, don't you mean?

38:37.129 --> 38:40.121
Mandy?

38:40.225 --> 38:42.556
Listen, I'm gonna take her home.

38:42.661 --> 38:43.947
Oh.

38:44.052 --> 38:45.131
No, just take her home.

38:55.360 --> 38:56.229
I'm off to bed.

38:56.334 --> 38:56.995
What?

38:57.099 --> 38:58.491
So early?

38:58.595 --> 38:59.952
I'm knackered.

39:00.056 --> 39:00.996
You coming?

39:01.100 --> 39:02.596
In a bit.

39:16.930 --> 39:18.078
Tequila?

39:18.183 --> 39:19.018
Yes.

39:27.576 --> 39:28.516
Sh.

39:28.620 --> 39:29.560
In here.

39:41.528 --> 39:43.928
Norma?

39:44.034 --> 39:46.260
Poor little mite will be in limbo forever

39:46.364 --> 39:47.860
if I don't do something.

39:47.965 --> 39:48.904
What?

39:49.008 --> 39:51.166
Dead.

39:51.270 --> 39:52.418
All alone.

39:52.522 --> 39:54.958
My, God stop being so fucking morbid.

39:55.062 --> 39:57.532
What's the matter?

39:57.637 --> 39:59.098
Little baby.

39:59.202 --> 40:00.315
Someone's baby.

40:00.420 --> 40:01.255
It's not a baby.

40:01.359 --> 40:03.691
It's a fucking cat.

40:03.795 --> 40:05.117
No.

40:05.221 --> 40:07.657
Still Norma, look, rib cages flat on both sides,

40:07.761 --> 40:08.944
and limbs that run proportion.

40:09.048 --> 40:12.423
And it's a fucking moggy, is that.

40:12.528 --> 40:13.954
He's amazing, isn't he?

40:31.281 --> 40:32.150
Shane!

40:46.589 --> 40:48.502
Sorry, I can't.

40:48.606 --> 40:49.720
Yeah, you can.

40:49.824 --> 40:51.425
I'm married.

40:51.529 --> 40:54.416
Yeah, to a moron.

40:54.521 --> 40:55.878
What?

40:55.983 --> 40:56.922
Sorry, but--

40:57.026 --> 41:00.366
Get the fuck outta me pub.

41:00.470 --> 41:01.201
What?

41:01.306 --> 41:02.349
Now.

41:09.203 --> 41:13.796
I don't think I'll be coming to class anymore.

41:13.900 --> 41:15.570
On, no, why not?

41:15.674 --> 41:19.154
It's not really my thing.

41:19.258 --> 41:21.937
I think you found your thing tonight though.

41:22.041 --> 41:23.190
Didn't you?

41:23.294 --> 41:24.825
We're all good at something.

41:24.929 --> 41:27.504
Just takes some of us a little longer to suss out what it is.

41:31.923 --> 41:33.209
Exactly.

41:33.314 --> 41:37.697
You could give my place to someone what really needs it.

41:37.803 --> 41:38.811
Yeah, I could really.

41:41.768 --> 41:44.099
Beer?

41:44.204 --> 41:47.057
Yeah, go on then.

41:47.161 --> 41:48.866
One for the road.

41:48.970 --> 41:49.805
Twisted my arm.

42:22.997 --> 42:24.353
Sorry for being a cow.

42:29.885 --> 42:30.755
I'm sorry too.

43:09.791 --> 43:13.410
- Nothing happened. - Good job.

43:13.514 --> 43:16.054
I'm a gent, you know?

43:16.158 --> 43:19.046
But you're right, Shane, if we had, I couldn't even remember.

43:28.440 --> 43:32.267
[inaudible]?

43:32.371 --> 43:35.364
[music playing]

44:01.352 --> 44:03.267
What?

44:03.371 --> 44:04.484
Good night?

44:04.589 --> 44:05.423
Yeah.

44:08.450 --> 44:09.494
What you playing at, Carl?

44:15.199 --> 44:18.679
Did you cut up?

44:18.783 --> 44:21.532
Listen, Carl, we're mates, aren't we?

44:21.636 --> 44:22.506
Mates?

44:22.611 --> 44:23.619
With a bird?

44:23.724 --> 44:24.559
What about--

44:24.663 --> 44:25.847
So we shagged.

44:25.951 --> 44:28.525
You were great, but you're not my fella.

44:28.630 --> 44:30.891
So don't go on moody bollocks just 'cause I went out,

44:30.995 --> 44:35.657
got off me tits, and had a laugh without you, because you can't.

44:35.762 --> 44:38.336
We might as well be mates though if we like each other,

44:38.440 --> 44:40.806
don't you think?

44:40.911 --> 44:41.886
I suppose so.

44:44.599 --> 44:52.079
Might be the odd night, if you're lonely and I'm lonely.

44:52.183 --> 44:54.828
You made me squeal.

44:54.932 --> 44:57.368
Be a fool not to.

44:57.472 --> 44:59.247
When you put it like that.

45:02.168 --> 45:04.187
Right.

45:04.291 --> 45:05.231
Any chance of a shag then?

45:34.142 --> 45:37.726
Maybe after all I am into all the bullshit.

45:37.830 --> 45:40.579
Just another way of looking at things.

45:40.683 --> 45:42.596
Things happen for a reason.

45:42.702 --> 45:46.146
The best things come to those who wait.

45:46.250 --> 45:49.834
Sounds so fake though, don't it?

45:49.938 --> 45:52.617
Check out the girth on that, she said,

45:52.721 --> 45:55.748
as he put the big black stallion back in its stable.

45:55.852 --> 45:58.044
She tossed back her glorious mane of hair

45:58.148 --> 46:01.141
and opened her top two buttons.

46:01.245 --> 46:05.733
And hot [inaudible],, she said, as he caught a glimpse

46:05.837 --> 46:07.369
of top of her huge tits.

46:07.473 --> 46:12.031
I'll tell me what my philosophy is, you're born, then you die.

46:12.135 --> 46:15.405
In between, you might as well do whatever it takes to get

46:15.509 --> 46:17.318
as much of a buzz as you can.

46:17.423 --> 46:18.258
Dead simple.

46:29.913 --> 46:30.749
Fuck.

46:36.072 --> 46:40.108
[theme music]

47:17.683 --> 47:20.536
That's fucking brilliant.

47:20.640 --> 47:21.544
Get on, Micky.

47:21.648 --> 47:22.519
Your turn.

47:30.625 --> 47:32.226
Yeah.
