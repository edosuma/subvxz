00:00.543 --> 00:01.710
Previously on
<i>Alphas...</i>

00:01.778 --> 00:03.578
I have this thing
where I can't remember

00:03.717 --> 00:05.651
anything that happened,
like, more than a month ago.

00:06.588 --> 00:07.856
That's gotta be lonely.

00:07.857 --> 00:09.324
You said that you would bring
my dad around

00:09.392 --> 00:10.824
to our way of thinking.

00:10.892 --> 00:13.057
Do you understand everything
I'm risking for this?

00:13.129 --> 00:17.256
Someone close to us
is working with Parish.

00:18.620 --> 00:21.178
Cameron, is that one
of Dani's paintings?

00:21.245 --> 00:22.245
Yeah, she just finished it.

00:22.313 --> 00:25.041
You haven't seen it before?

00:25.106 --> 00:26.671
Yes, I have.

00:30.772 --> 00:32.705
This is what we came here for,
the ultimate rush.

00:32.773 --> 00:34.406
Hold this.

00:34.474 --> 00:36.210
Put it under your tongue.

00:36.278 --> 00:39.077
It gets hot, and you'll feel
it moving through your body.

00:39.145 --> 00:41.542
Just look at your hands.

00:41.610 --> 00:43.207
You'll know when it kicks in.

00:43.275 --> 00:44.774
- This is insane.
- That's why it's so awesome.

00:44.842 --> 00:46.140
It's not gonna hurt, right?

00:46.207 --> 00:48.507
No.

00:48.575 --> 00:50.506
All right, who's first?

00:50.573 --> 00:52.139
- Let's go.
- Let's do it.

00:52.207 --> 00:54.171
High dive from the 21st floor.

00:56.000 --> 01:02.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:07.707 --> 01:09.407
- Right?
- That was awesome!

01:09.475 --> 01:11.375
- That was amazing.
- Totally.

01:11.443 --> 01:13.177
Are we doing it again?

01:22.450 --> 01:25.851
Hey, Doc,
you want whip cream?

01:27.921 --> 01:30.388
No, not for me.
Thanks, Nathan.

01:30.455 --> 01:31.822
Uh, forgive me for intruding
on your family this way,

01:31.890 --> 01:32.957
especially at this hour.

01:33.024 --> 01:35.325
Not a problem.

01:35.393 --> 01:36.425
When you said
the investigation

01:36.493 --> 01:37.792
into Parish's inside source

01:37.860 --> 01:41.928
is moving forward, um...
What do you mean?

01:41.996 --> 01:43.729
The abduction was
a break for us.

01:43.797 --> 01:45.130
When your team
tracked you down,

01:45.197 --> 01:46.731
they opened a door into Parish's
communications network.

01:46.799 --> 01:49.733
Now, it closed pretty fast,
but we were able

01:49.801 --> 01:51.301
to get a flash clone
of his cell log.

01:51.369 --> 01:54.069
Every number Parish called,
every number that called him.

01:54.137 --> 01:55.370
It's encrypted.

01:55.437 --> 01:57.438
Tight as hell,
but NSA's been working overtime

01:57.505 --> 01:58.838
to decode it.

01:58.906 --> 02:00.973
They could have something solid
on his inside source

02:01.040 --> 02:03.008
in three, maybe four days.

02:03.075 --> 02:06.510
Four days?
And then you'll be certain?

02:06.578 --> 02:08.377
We're moving
as fast as we can, Doc.

02:08.445 --> 02:11.380
Believe me,
I want to get this S.O.B.

02:11.447 --> 02:12.514
as bad as you do.

02:12.582 --> 02:16.847
Daddy, daddy!
We don't have any tape.

02:16.914 --> 02:20.397
This guy tells me last night
he's got a model

02:20.465 --> 02:23.747
of the whole solar system
that's due today.

02:23.815 --> 02:25.214
You better hurry up.

02:25.282 --> 02:27.448
Thanks.

02:27.515 --> 02:31.116
I don't know.
Do you help 'em?

02:31.183 --> 02:32.250
Kids have to learn
how to deal

02:32.317 --> 02:33.317
with their own problems,
right?

02:33.385 --> 02:37.319
Indeed, they do.
Yeah.

02:37.387 --> 02:39.120
Nathan, I'd love to have a look
at whatever you have

02:39.188 --> 02:41.589
concerning these encrypted
phone numbers.

02:41.656 --> 02:42.856
I can't do that.

02:42.924 --> 02:44.691
These internal investigations
are tight.

02:44.759 --> 02:46.392
I can't even involve
my own people.

02:46.460 --> 02:48.460
We'll get him, and he will
never see daylight again,

02:48.528 --> 02:50.094
because I'm gonna put him
in a room

02:50.162 --> 02:52.896
and I'm gonna throw away
the room.

02:59.969 --> 03:03.504
This is from the net.

03:07.308 --> 03:09.310
Analysts kicked
this video over to us.

03:09.377 --> 03:10.878
Now, either there
are four people

03:10.945 --> 03:13.079
with the exact same
Alpha ability,

03:13.147 --> 03:15.615
or there's some kinda drug
that's turning people

03:15.683 --> 03:16.950
into Alphas.

03:17.017 --> 03:20.519
Either way, we need to get
to the bottom of this.

03:20.587 --> 03:23.422
Right, Bill.

03:23.489 --> 03:26.057
I trust you to take the reins
on this one.

03:26.125 --> 03:28.726
Uh, okay, I can do that.

03:28.793 --> 03:31.361
So you just want me
to keep you updated?

03:31.428 --> 03:32.395
Yes, please.

03:36.232 --> 03:37.332
Gare, got you a present.

03:37.400 --> 03:39.767
Tada!
Oh...

03:39.835 --> 03:41.368
This is a plant.
Yep.

03:41.436 --> 03:42.736
You're not supposed
to just give someone a plant.

03:42.804 --> 03:44.705
This could have bugs in it.

03:44.772 --> 03:46.874
You're welcome.
It's for your man cave.

03:46.941 --> 03:48.408
Bill, we need to call
the exterminators.

03:48.476 --> 03:49.476
- Oh, come on, Gary.
- Kat's brought some bugs

03:49.543 --> 03:50.810
into the office.
All right.

03:50.878 --> 03:52.812
Gary, I just sent you
a YouTube link, okay?

03:52.880 --> 03:54.313
I need you both to focus.

03:54.381 --> 03:55.882
Focus is my middle name.

03:55.949 --> 03:57.350
No, you can't know that
for sure.

03:57.417 --> 03:59.151
Gary, I need you to do
face grabs off the video, okay?

03:59.219 --> 04:00.620
- I--
- Check the Internet

04:00.687 --> 04:03.188
for any matches, okay?

04:03.256 --> 04:04.255
We're looking for any indication
that these people

04:04.323 --> 04:05.790
may be Alphas.

04:05.858 --> 04:06.924
Hey, what about me?

04:06.992 --> 04:08.159
You can call
the exterminator.

04:08.226 --> 04:10.294
Bring bugs in here?
You take care of that.

04:12.831 --> 04:16.266
Douche bag.

04:19.103 --> 04:21.438
- Hey.
- Hey.

04:21.505 --> 04:24.775
So I thought of another thing
for Friday night.

04:24.843 --> 04:26.443
My mom will offer you coffee
as soon as you get there,

04:26.511 --> 04:29.146
but you must turn her down
three times before accepting it,

04:29.214 --> 04:31.148
and then once you take it,
you have to drink it all.

04:31.216 --> 04:33.417
Every last sip.

04:33.485 --> 04:34.885
Okay, I'll make sure
I come thirsty.

04:34.953 --> 04:36.887
Oh!
And don't compliment

04:36.954 --> 04:38.655
anything in the house,
like a painting or a lamp,

04:38.723 --> 04:40.924
because they'll insist
that you take it home with you,

04:40.992 --> 04:42.225
and then afterwards,
they'll complain about it,

04:42.293 --> 04:43.493
like, "you're the boy
who stole the lamp."

04:45.897 --> 04:47.164
I'm serious.

04:47.232 --> 04:48.632
Oh, I know.

04:48.700 --> 04:51.302
It's just...you're cute
when you're worried.

04:52.805 --> 04:54.573
Does this look like
the face of a worried person?

04:54.640 --> 04:56.308
- Rachel.
- Uh-huh?

04:56.376 --> 04:57.810
You know I've been
in actual combat, right?

04:57.878 --> 04:59.212
Yes.

04:59.279 --> 05:00.446
I think I can handle dinner
with your parents.

05:00.514 --> 05:01.948
Yes.

05:02.016 --> 05:03.116
Yeah.

05:03.184 --> 05:07.187
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:09.857 --> 05:12.459
Breathe.
Deep breaths.

05:12.527 --> 05:14.661
So he's not
an Iranian lawyer.

05:14.729 --> 05:16.563
Your parents
will just have to deal.

05:16.631 --> 05:18.798
He's the blondest boy
I have ever seen.

05:18.866 --> 05:20.700
They're gonna rip him
to shreds.

05:25.907 --> 05:29.509
Mwah!

05:29.577 --> 05:32.279
Lala, daddy!

05:36.485 --> 05:39.487
Dr. Rosen.

05:39.555 --> 05:42.857
Gary, w-would you close
the door, please?

05:42.925 --> 05:46.027
Gary, I need you to handle
an assignment for me.

05:46.095 --> 05:47.663
I'm already doing
a case for Bill.

05:47.730 --> 05:50.932
But I-I can multitask.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.202
Gary, um--

05:53.269 --> 05:56.138
you can't speak
to anyone about this.

05:56.206 --> 05:58.975
If, uh, that makes
you uncomfortable, I understand.

05:59.043 --> 06:02.712
No, I'm not uncomfortable,
'cause I'm a secret agent.

06:02.780 --> 06:05.415
Secret's what I do best.

06:05.483 --> 06:06.917
Secret's my middle name.

06:14.059 --> 06:17.701
Hey, Tyler!

06:17.769 --> 06:20.247
How are you, pal?

06:20.315 --> 06:21.318
How was the flight?

06:21.386 --> 06:25.890
Bumpy, but they had TVs.

06:25.958 --> 06:27.293
There's somebody I want you
to meet.

06:27.361 --> 06:28.461
This is my friend Dani.

06:28.528 --> 06:32.231
Hey, Tyler.

06:32.299 --> 06:36.269
I hate it
when the flight's bumpy too.

06:36.337 --> 06:39.139
Come on.

06:39.207 --> 06:40.941
Hey, that's a--

06:41.008 --> 06:43.309
that's a nice deck.
How long you been skating?

06:43.377 --> 06:44.777
A while.

06:44.845 --> 06:47.413
Well, I know this cool
skate park over on the westside.

06:47.481 --> 06:48.982
You wanna check it out?

06:49.050 --> 06:50.316
Sweet.

06:50.384 --> 06:51.884
Um, Dad, can we go?

06:51.952 --> 06:54.454
Yeah, of course we can.

07:04.631 --> 07:06.332
Busted!
Bill!

07:06.400 --> 07:07.533
She's a criminal!

07:07.601 --> 07:09.302
She's busted,
and I get to cuff her.

07:09.369 --> 07:10.603
Hey, get up!
Assume the position!

07:10.671 --> 07:11.971
Get up!
You assume the position.

07:12.039 --> 07:14.574
Get off me.
Bill, bring your cuffs!

07:14.641 --> 07:15.708
Gary, what the hell
are you talking about?

07:15.776 --> 07:17.443
The- I found the guy
from the video.

07:17.511 --> 07:18.578
Look.

07:18.645 --> 07:19.779
He's, like, the ringleader.

07:19.847 --> 07:21.848
- Yeah.
- And this is his Facebook.

07:21.915 --> 07:22.982
And that picture,

07:23.050 --> 07:24.417
it was taken last year.
Okay, so?

07:24.485 --> 07:27.554
So, Bill, look there.
It's her.

07:27.622 --> 07:30.692
She's one of them.

07:30.759 --> 07:33.594
I kinda look hot
with pink highlights.

This is drug-related.

08:14.035 --> 08:16.737
It's called "Jump."
I found more videos.

But he's having
a party tonight,

08:27.014 --> 08:28.581
and if Gary can get his address,
I can get reacquainted.

08:28.649 --> 08:30.149
I mean, maybe score
a little Jump.

08:30.217 --> 08:32.284
Uh, I'm essential
to this case now, right?

08:32.352 --> 08:33.719
No, I'm not gonna

08:41.529 --> 08:42.763

09:29.310 --> 09:31.411

You don't have a clue
who I am, do you?

09:50.130 --> 09:53.733
I've been pushed
off your mental TiVo.

09:53.800 --> 09:56.602
Maybe you should refresh
my memory.

09:56.670 --> 09:57.736
You mind?

09:57.804 --> 10:01.040
Do I look like I mind?

10:04.743 --> 10:06.109

this guy?

10:07.779 --> 10:08.779
I don't wanna see that.

10:08.846 --> 10:13.048
♪ Let's grow old together ♪

10:13.116 --> 10:16.351

10:16.419 --> 10:17.819

Kat's an old friend.

10:25.059 --> 10:26.326
Hey.

10:26.394 --> 10:28.428
I thought we were gonna
hang out tonight.

10:28.495 --> 10:32.565
Just give us a minute.

Are you guys together?
Are you kidding?

10:44.812 --> 10:47.914
You're irreplaceable.

10:50.851 --> 10:52.686
Um...

10:52.754 --> 10:54.889
What are they doing?

10:54.956 --> 10:57.858
Havin' a good time.

10:57.926 --> 10:59.760
- Damn.
- Whoa.

10:59.828 --> 11:01.562
That's not a fun party, Bill.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.467
Come on!

11:24.152 --> 11:25.953
Not even a scratch.

11:26.021 --> 11:28.956
I'll have what he's having.

11:55.954 --> 11:59.190
Come on.
I'll show you.

12:02.928 --> 12:04.863
Kat, where you goin'?

12:04.930 --> 12:06.931
Kat, you're going
out of range, okay?

12:06.999 --> 12:08.299
I can't hear you.
Gary, follow her on the comm.

12:08.367 --> 12:09.934
- Yeah, yeah, in the alleyway.
- Follow her signal.

12:10.002 --> 12:13.271
We should just leave her.
She's useless.

12:13.339 --> 12:16.142
Watch your step.

12:16.209 --> 12:18.110
Come on.

12:18.178 --> 12:20.379
- Can I open them now?
- No.

12:20.447 --> 12:24.016
- Please?
- No, a couple more steps.

12:24.084 --> 12:27.186
Now.

12:27.254 --> 12:30.289
I was hoping you'd come back
so we could do this together.

12:34.294 --> 12:35.495
Come on!

12:35.562 --> 12:38.097
You were always
crazy brave, right?

12:38.165 --> 12:40.199
I know you forget stuff,
but that doesn't change

12:40.267 --> 12:41.800
who you really are.

12:41.868 --> 12:43.469
Trust me, kitty Kat.

13:11.865 --> 13:15.435
Kat?

13:17.004 --> 13:18.304
You all right?

13:18.372 --> 13:20.607
It was incredible!

13:22.410 --> 13:24.677
Mmm, no, we gotta go.
We gotta go.

13:28.798 --> 13:30.511
So my mom's gonna keep
on offering you food

13:30.513 --> 13:31.613
no matter how full you are,

13:31.681 --> 13:33.014
and you have to keep
on eating it.

13:33.082 --> 13:34.382
- All right, good tip.
- Okay.

13:39.054 --> 13:40.955
- Rachel.
- Yeah?

13:47.096 --> 13:48.463
You speak Farsi.

13:48.531 --> 13:50.198
Six years
in the Middle East,

13:50.265 --> 13:52.633
you're bound to pick
up a couple things.

13:52.701 --> 13:55.636
Hey, I'm complicated.

13:55.704 --> 13:57.805
You don't peel back an onion
like this in a couple weeks.

13:57.873 --> 14:00.341
John...

14:00.409 --> 14:01.643
You should've told me that.

14:01.710 --> 14:05.113
I wanted it
to be a surprise.

14:05.181 --> 14:06.715
There are rules, Kat.

14:06.783 --> 14:09.885
And rule number one: You don't
dive off a freaking roof.

14:09.953 --> 14:12.054
That doesn't sound
like a real rule.

14:12.122 --> 14:13.822
Everything's a joke to you,
isn't it?

14:13.890 --> 14:15.157
Kat, where you going?

14:15.225 --> 14:16.926
I should've never let
you go undercover.

14:16.994 --> 14:18.528
Why, because I did so well?

14:18.596 --> 14:21.030
Look, there's a weird-ass drug
out on the street,

14:21.098 --> 14:22.898
and I got a sample of it.

14:22.966 --> 14:24.967
Plus, I found out
what my favorite color is.

14:25.035 --> 14:26.435
You have a sample of it?

14:26.503 --> 14:28.271
It's green.
Thanks for asking.

14:30.708 --> 14:31.941
Where's the sample, Kat?

14:32.009 --> 14:33.509
Right in here.

14:33.577 --> 14:35.244
Who's Donnie Brasco now, bitch?

14:45.355 --> 14:46.622
I made that.

14:46.689 --> 14:48.657
I made that
with a label maker.

14:48.725 --> 14:50.659
We don't have
any "top secret" stickers.

14:50.726 --> 14:52.126
We needed some, so I--

14:52.194 --> 14:55.429
I made 200.

14:55.497 --> 14:58.565
This is what Cley got
off Parish's phone.

14:58.633 --> 15:00.133
The NSA is still working
on it,

15:00.201 --> 15:01.735
but I cracked it.

15:01.802 --> 15:03.503
You didn't even ask me to,
but I cracked it anyway.

15:03.571 --> 15:04.938
Well, what does it mean?

15:05.006 --> 15:06.939
It means
that I took initiative.

15:07.007 --> 15:09.241
No, I know, Gary.
Um, thank you.

15:09.309 --> 15:11.177
But, no, the numbers.
Oh, yeah, you were right.

15:11.244 --> 15:12.477
It's telephone numbers.

15:12.545 --> 15:14.880
It's a very complicated system,
Dr. Rosen.

15:14.947 --> 15:16.148
It was--it's even harder
to crack

15:16.215 --> 15:18.616
than Anna's code,
but I think it must've

15:18.684 --> 15:20.551
been made
by a-a supercomputer,

15:20.619 --> 15:22.320
or an Alpha.

15:22.387 --> 15:23.821
Gary, I want you to write down
any of these numbers

15:23.889 --> 15:26.391
in the New York area that are
still active, all right?

15:26.458 --> 15:27.492
Yeah.

15:30.829 --> 15:32.597
You saw that thing
with the can, right?

15:32.665 --> 15:35.801
You mean when he threw
it in the garbage?

15:35.869 --> 15:37.636
Yeah, he's quite
the little environmentalist.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.939
Off the wall,
into the recycling bin,

15:40.006 --> 15:41.841
and he was barely even looking.

15:41.908 --> 15:44.811
Cam, don't.

15:44.878 --> 15:47.246
I mean, what if he is?
Does it matter?

15:47.314 --> 15:50.684
Yes, it matters.

15:50.751 --> 15:54.121
Maybe I can help him
understand it,

15:54.189 --> 15:56.890
you know, so he doesn't feel
like such a freak.

15:56.958 --> 15:58.459
I don't know,
I think I should ask your dad

15:58.527 --> 15:59.660
to run some tests on him.

15:59.728 --> 16:02.864
No, no, no, no.
Listen.

16:02.932 --> 16:04.299
My dad ran a few tests on me.

16:04.367 --> 16:08.337
It basically ruined my life.

16:08.405 --> 16:09.905
This is your
ruined life?

16:09.973 --> 16:12.274
Uh, you, me, and ice cream?

16:13.544 --> 16:15.945
No, this is...

16:16.013 --> 16:19.248
pretty friggin' perfect.

16:19.316 --> 16:23.419
I love you,
you know that?

16:23.487 --> 16:28.625
Hey.

16:28.693 --> 16:30.426
Me too.

16:36.700 --> 16:37.734
Dad?

16:37.801 --> 16:42.805
Are we playing video games?

16:42.873 --> 16:44.574
Yeah, pal, hang on.

16:44.642 --> 16:46.209
Get ready
to get your butt kicked.

16:46.277 --> 16:48.912
- Yeah, okay.
- All right.

16:48.980 --> 16:51.949
Here we go.

16:55.388 --> 16:56.922
Oh, wow.

16:56.989 --> 16:58.123
What?

16:58.190 --> 17:00.625
The compound in Kat's blood.

17:00.692 --> 17:03.061
It reshaped the tissue
at the molecular level,

17:03.128 --> 17:05.829
creating a short-term form
of chitinous, which...

17:05.897 --> 17:07.265
What?

17:07.333 --> 17:08.733
It...it made, um,

17:08.800 --> 17:11.002
a protective shield around
the body like Kevlar skin.

17:11.069 --> 17:12.204
So jump makes you
indestructible?

17:12.271 --> 17:14.271
Maybe not.

17:14.339 --> 17:16.174
One of the kids in the video,
Tony Dolan,

17:16.242 --> 17:19.077
he was found dead
a day after he jumped.

17:19.145 --> 17:20.345
Let's get an autopsy
on that, please.

17:20.413 --> 17:22.881
I already got it,
but it doesn't mean

17:22.948 --> 17:24.115
I actually understand it.

17:24.183 --> 17:26.751
Tony died
of cardiac fibrosis.

17:26.819 --> 17:27.785
The hardening didn't stop
at his skin.

17:27.853 --> 17:30.121
It solidified his heart.

17:30.189 --> 17:32.523
Yeah, there were eight cases
of cardiac fibrosis

17:32.591 --> 17:34.058
in the metropolitan area.

17:34.126 --> 17:35.760
That's in the last
three weeks.

17:35.828 --> 17:38.228
So Jump can make you
indestructible,

17:38.296 --> 17:39.930
but it can also kill you.

17:39.997 --> 17:41.999
Kat, we need to get
you checked out,

17:42.066 --> 17:43.734
and we gotta get this drug
off the streets.

17:51.343 --> 17:52.409
Dad.

17:52.477 --> 17:54.244
Hi, Danielle.

17:54.312 --> 17:55.679
What's wrong?
Is--is mom okay?

17:55.746 --> 17:56.847
Everything's fine

17:56.914 --> 17:59.149
as far as I know.

17:59.217 --> 18:01.284
I just wanted to see you.

18:01.352 --> 18:02.953
It's, uh...

18:03.021 --> 18:05.355
It's been a while.

18:05.423 --> 18:07.691
Well, um, come on up.

18:13.965 --> 18:14.932
Sorry.
It's, uh...

18:14.999 --> 18:17.567
the same as always.

18:21.672 --> 18:22.705
Wow, these are different.

18:22.773 --> 18:24.440
Yeah.

18:24.508 --> 18:25.841
Uh, it's not done yet.

18:25.909 --> 18:27.743
Well, they're nice,
uh, very nice.

18:27.811 --> 18:29.145
Oh, my goodness.

18:29.213 --> 18:30.879
You still have this
one after all these years.

18:30.947 --> 18:32.181
Yeah.

18:32.249 --> 18:34.884
I still like the way
the hands came out.

18:34.951 --> 18:37.152
Yeah, in Mr. Tzodee's class,
7th grade, right?

18:37.220 --> 18:39.221
- Yeah.
- Boy, you hated him.

18:40.757 --> 18:43.458
I think you said
it was his bad breath.

18:43.526 --> 18:46.695
Yeah.

18:46.763 --> 18:49.565
Oh, I really did tell you
everything back then, didn't I?

18:49.633 --> 18:52.535
Well, you still can, Dani.

18:52.603 --> 18:53.636
Yeah?

18:53.704 --> 18:56.773
Sure.

18:56.840 --> 18:59.075
Oh, there is, um...

18:59.143 --> 19:03.878
there's one thing.

19:03.945 --> 19:05.780
Cameron.

19:05.847 --> 19:08.282
- Right.
- I mean...

19:08.350 --> 19:10.618
this is me
we're talking about.

19:10.686 --> 19:14.122
I just keep wondering
how I'm gonna screw it up.

19:14.190 --> 19:16.759
It's inevitable, right?

19:16.827 --> 19:18.394
Dani, nothing's inevitable.

19:18.461 --> 19:22.631
Not in this life, anyway.

19:22.699 --> 19:25.167
Yeah, and I'm starting
to believe that too.

19:25.234 --> 19:27.669
Right.

19:27.737 --> 19:29.438
You okay?

19:29.506 --> 19:33.275
Yeah, I'm just, uh--
just, you know, uh--

19:33.343 --> 19:35.877
I'd love a cup of tea.

19:35.945 --> 19:37.045
Yeah.

19:37.112 --> 19:39.180
Uh, yeah, of course, yes.

19:39.248 --> 19:43.083
You make yourself at home.

19:54.994 --> 19:58.931
Still no sugar, right?
Uh, right.

20:45.546 --> 20:49.883
There you go.

20:49.951 --> 20:50.984
Oh, yes.

20:51.052 --> 20:54.321
Lapsang souchong road tar tea.

20:54.389 --> 20:58.926
I remember.

21:24.902 --> 21:28.538
- Morning.
- Morning.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.176
I know that look, Lee.

21:34.244 --> 21:37.813
Don't worry.
I'm all over this.

21:37.880 --> 21:39.047
Got the NSA to triple
their manpower

21:39.115 --> 21:42.017
on the investigation.

21:43.219 --> 21:44.286
You came by house

21:44.354 --> 21:45.487
to light a fire under my ass,

21:45.555 --> 21:46.855
and I heard you,
loud and clear.

21:46.923 --> 21:47.756
Thank you
for your diligence.

21:47.824 --> 21:50.024
Oh, by the way, Nathan...

21:50.092 --> 21:52.794
how'd it turn out with your
son's solar system project?

21:52.861 --> 21:55.129
I did Neptune and Saturn,
and had to hear

21:55.197 --> 21:57.665
about 300 Uranus jokes.

21:57.732 --> 22:00.201
Kid needs your help,
what are you gonna do?

22:09.010 --> 22:11.145
Hey,
tonight's the night, huh?

22:11.213 --> 22:12.847
John versus the Pirzads.

22:12.914 --> 22:15.983
Should be on pay-per-view.

22:16.051 --> 22:18.318
He speaks Farsi.

22:18.386 --> 22:19.620
Well, great.

22:19.687 --> 22:21.255
He'll knock it out
of the park.

22:21.322 --> 22:23.290
Yeah.

22:23.357 --> 22:25.959
I canceled dinner.

22:26.027 --> 22:27.294
I thought this
was what you wanted.

22:27.361 --> 22:29.429
It is.

22:29.497 --> 22:32.498
I mean, it was.

22:32.565 --> 22:33.765
All right, spill.

22:34.363 --> 22:36.464
What if my parents
actually like him?

22:36.531 --> 22:37.665
Then what?

22:37.733 --> 22:40.368
Then you have
a hot boyfriend.

22:40.436 --> 22:42.337
That's what people call
a real relationship.

22:42.404 --> 22:45.606
Not that it's a topic
I know much about at the moment.

22:45.674 --> 22:47.208
What if I'm not ready?

22:47.276 --> 22:51.479
The last time I had
a real boyfriend...

22:51.546 --> 22:52.580
was over three years ago.

22:52.647 --> 22:55.783
Three years, no sex?

22:57.852 --> 22:59.919
I can't.

22:59.987 --> 23:00.820
With him,
I had to get so drunk

23:00.888 --> 23:02.255
I couldn't feel anything.

23:02.323 --> 23:03.390
That was three years ago,

23:03.457 --> 23:05.458
and John isn't that guy.

23:05.526 --> 23:08.161
Yeah.

23:08.229 --> 23:10.530
But I'm still me.

23:10.598 --> 23:12.199
And I'm a total freak.

23:12.266 --> 23:13.967
No, Rachel, you're not.

23:14.035 --> 23:17.504
Think of everything
you've done since then.

23:17.572 --> 23:20.273
Think of everything
you do here, every day.

23:20.341 --> 23:23.043
You're strong,
and you're capable,

23:23.111 --> 23:24.912
and we're all freaks.

23:28.683 --> 23:30.950
That's my favorite?

23:31.018 --> 23:32.418
Chocolate chili
and rum raisin?

23:32.486 --> 23:33.953
Really?
You're messing with me.

23:34.021 --> 23:35.421
Seriously?

23:35.489 --> 23:40.260
Where's the trust?

23:40.328 --> 23:42.763
Okay.

23:48.602 --> 23:50.070
Oh, that's really good.

23:50.137 --> 23:52.372
It's disgusting.

23:52.439 --> 23:55.808
But you love it.

23:55.876 --> 23:59.312
I'm starting to think
I'm really weird.

23:59.380 --> 24:03.049
But so friggin' cute.

24:03.117 --> 24:05.084
So, uh, what are we
doing tonight?

24:05.152 --> 24:08.154
Can we get more Jump?

24:08.222 --> 24:11.024
I can get as much
as we want.

24:11.091 --> 24:15.728
Got the New York franchise.

24:15.796 --> 24:16.929
Do you deal it?

24:16.997 --> 24:18.931
Let's just say
I know where to get it.

24:18.999 --> 24:20.232
Mm.

24:20.300 --> 24:23.637
I have something.

24:23.704 --> 24:25.572
It's yours.

24:25.640 --> 24:27.241
You gave it to me
the last time I saw you.

24:27.308 --> 24:31.278
This is mine?

24:34.717 --> 24:37.519
This is mine.

24:37.586 --> 24:39.721
The first day we met,

24:39.789 --> 24:42.257
you were hustling money

24:42.325 --> 24:44.426
doing that knife trick
from <i>aliens.</i>

24:44.493 --> 24:46.695
Just trust me.

24:46.762 --> 24:50.865
You know the one
where you stab really quickly

24:50.933 --> 24:54.036
in between your fingers
really fast?

25:03.880 --> 25:05.147
I thought you were badass.

25:05.215 --> 25:07.616
You thought I was handsome.

25:07.684 --> 25:09.918
We were both right.

25:13.022 --> 25:15.357
Who's J.D.?

25:15.425 --> 25:17.459
I have no idea.

25:17.527 --> 25:18.661
Before my time.

25:22.800 --> 25:27.070
I really missed you, Kat.

25:27.138 --> 25:28.772
You can't arrest him.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.208
Kat, this is rule number two
for field work, okay?

25:31.275 --> 25:33.477
Whatever I say is what goes.

25:33.545 --> 25:35.079
Now, we're gonna
arrest him, okay?

25:35.146 --> 25:37.281
We're gonna lean on him,
and then he gives up his source.

25:37.349 --> 25:39.584
That's the way it works, Kat.
But-but I-I can get him

25:39.651 --> 25:40.718
to tell me
who's making this stuff.

25:40.786 --> 25:42.520
I know I can.

25:42.587 --> 25:45.589
Kat, you got out of him
what you could, okay?

25:45.657 --> 25:49.494
Now, in an hour,
I will have an arrest warrant.

25:49.561 --> 25:51.462
Now, you did your job.
Let me do mine.

25:51.530 --> 25:53.932
Thank you.

25:59.105 --> 26:00.706
Nice one, pal.

26:00.774 --> 26:02.107
Hey, listen.

26:02.175 --> 26:03.308
I want you
to hit this next one

26:03.376 --> 26:07.346
right down
the third base line, okay?

26:09.582 --> 26:11.283
Come on, pal,
you're not even trying.

26:11.350 --> 26:14.519
I suck, okay?

26:14.587 --> 26:15.754
I don't wanna
hit balls anymore.

26:15.822 --> 26:17.455
I just--

26:17.523 --> 26:18.657
I just wanna go home.

26:18.724 --> 26:19.991
Okay, look.
We'll go home.

26:20.059 --> 26:20.925
We'll, uh, we'll play
video games, all right?

26:20.993 --> 26:22.093
Whatever you wanna do.

26:22.161 --> 26:24.128
No.
I wanna go home.

26:24.196 --> 26:25.797
My home.

26:25.864 --> 26:29.333
Tyler.

26:29.401 --> 26:32.070
Hey, that's for an official
government vehicle.

26:32.138 --> 26:33.339
You're not allowed
to take that.

26:33.406 --> 26:36.142
And you're gonna go
and help a drug dealer.

26:36.210 --> 26:37.376
You're not allowed
to do that either.

26:37.444 --> 26:38.644
Gary, Gary, look.
I care about this guy.

26:38.712 --> 26:40.079
It's like you care about Bill,

26:40.147 --> 26:41.647
and if he was in trouble,
you'd help him, right?

26:41.715 --> 26:43.082
Yeah, I'd help him.

26:43.150 --> 26:44.817
Yeah, I'd get his six,
'cause he's my partner,

26:44.885 --> 26:45.952
but we're federal agents.

26:46.020 --> 26:47.253
You're just a civilian.

26:47.321 --> 26:48.722
No, Gary.
Gary, you're right.

26:48.789 --> 26:50.691
- Yeah, I know I'm right.
- Look, I need your help.

26:50.758 --> 26:53.594
I'm not authorized
to do this on my own.

26:53.662 --> 26:55.663
Only a real federal agent
can check out

26:55.731 --> 26:56.764
an official
government vehicle.

26:56.832 --> 26:59.000
What do you say?

26:59.068 --> 27:00.535
Huh?

27:00.602 --> 27:04.272
I can't be b--yeah, yeah.
But I'm driving.

27:04.340 --> 27:06.974
Okay, fine.

27:07.042 --> 27:08.609
Can you drive?
Yeah, of course.

27:08.677 --> 27:10.945
I passed the test online.
I got a perfect score.

27:11.013 --> 27:12.981
But I'm better
if I don't drive on roads

27:13.048 --> 27:14.749
where there are other cars
or people,

27:14.817 --> 27:17.418
just 'cause--'cause they don't
always obey the rules,

27:17.486 --> 27:19.153
and I could mow people down.

27:19.221 --> 27:21.121
Okay, how 'bout
on the way back?

27:21.189 --> 27:22.522
I, uh--yeah, okay.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.330
You wanted to see me?

27:29.398 --> 27:31.132
Hi, Nina.

27:31.200 --> 27:35.603
You okay?

27:35.671 --> 27:37.872
I need a favor, Nina.

27:37.939 --> 27:39.340
Sure.

27:39.408 --> 27:43.111
You've always been there
for me.

27:43.179 --> 27:44.346
How long
would it take you

27:44.413 --> 27:48.584
to get a passport
under a false name?

27:48.651 --> 27:50.419
I could walk
into a federal building

27:50.487 --> 27:53.689
and come out with one today.

28:06.705 --> 28:11.008
Dani?

28:17.216 --> 28:19.317
Tyler, I'm sorry, okay?

28:19.385 --> 28:20.451
Whatever I did, I'm sorry.
Whatever, Dad.

28:20.519 --> 28:22.287
I just wanna go home.

28:22.355 --> 28:23.355
- Come on.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

28:23.423 --> 28:25.957
Come on.

28:26.025 --> 28:27.692
Hey, what happened?

28:27.760 --> 28:28.760
I took him to the park
to hit a few balls.

28:28.828 --> 28:30.829
Okay, Dani, I had to know.

28:30.897 --> 28:33.131
No, Cam, you didn't.

28:44.277 --> 28:46.678
Hey, Ty, can you come out here
for a minute?

28:49.582 --> 28:51.216
I don't wanna talk to him.

28:51.284 --> 28:52.284
Okay, well, you don't have
to talk to him.

28:52.352 --> 28:53.519
You can just talk to me.

28:53.587 --> 28:56.622
I don't wanna talk
to you either.

28:56.690 --> 28:57.790
I don't even know you.

28:57.858 --> 29:00.226
That's fair enough.

29:00.293 --> 29:03.163
How about no talking?

29:03.230 --> 29:07.433
Promise.

29:20.347 --> 29:24.117
Tyler,
have you heard about Alphas?

29:24.184 --> 29:25.718
Dani!

29:30.556 --> 29:32.758
I guess.

29:32.826 --> 29:36.796
Well...I am one.

29:42.236 --> 29:44.204
Give me your hand.

30:00.254 --> 30:05.325
Cameron, this is
how you made Tyler feel today.

30:14.036 --> 30:16.571
Tyler, this is how your dad
feels about you.

30:30.087 --> 30:31.287
Oh, pal, I am so sorry.

30:38.262 --> 30:39.229
Dad?

30:39.297 --> 30:41.865
I thought that you

30:41.932 --> 30:45.870
were disappointed in me.

30:45.938 --> 30:50.574
But this...

30:50.642 --> 30:53.845
feels like...

30:53.912 --> 30:55.613
I don't know
what to call it.

30:55.680 --> 31:00.451
It's just how I feel, pal.

31:04.956 --> 31:07.457
It's love, Tyler.

31:14.031 --> 31:15.665
Here, come here.

31:21.506 --> 31:22.806
Parish is manipulating her.

31:22.874 --> 31:25.842
She's hooked on his ideology.

31:25.910 --> 31:27.577
And Cley is on the verge
of catching her, Nina.

31:29.046 --> 31:30.246
I just have to get her
away from here.

31:30.314 --> 31:31.748
Away where?

31:31.815 --> 31:36.186
Anywhere where Cley or Parish
can never find her, ever.

31:36.253 --> 31:37.587
Now, I have some money
set aside--

31:37.655 --> 31:41.023
Yeah, a recovering addict
in a strange place?

31:41.091 --> 31:44.293
With no support system
and money to--

31:44.361 --> 31:45.661
she'll be dead
in three months.

31:45.729 --> 31:47.530
They'll send her
to Binghamton, Nina.

31:47.598 --> 31:52.268
You know they will.

31:52.336 --> 31:55.571
Well, I suppose I'm as much
at fault as she is.

31:55.639 --> 31:56.839
I've made so many mistakes.

31:56.906 --> 31:59.041
Dani's made her own.

31:59.109 --> 32:01.443
You can't keep blaming a
screwed up family life forever.

32:01.511 --> 32:02.711
You taught me that, remember?

32:06.783 --> 32:10.318
Maybe the best thing you can
do is just...

32:10.386 --> 32:13.722
Let Cley do his job.

32:13.789 --> 32:15.290
No.
No, no, no, no, no.

32:15.358 --> 32:17.392
You know
how Cley handles things.

32:17.459 --> 32:20.628
Anything could happen.
She could be dead on the street.

32:20.696 --> 32:24.632
Nina, she's my daughter.

32:28.536 --> 32:29.769
Dylan?

32:29.837 --> 32:31.304
Dylan!

32:31.372 --> 32:32.539
You've gotta get outta here
right now.

32:32.606 --> 32:34.174
Where are we going?

32:34.241 --> 32:35.642
Look, not "we," you.

32:35.710 --> 32:37.611
Look, I'm working
with the government, sort of.

32:37.678 --> 32:39.746
Look, a TAC team's
gonna bust down your door

32:39.814 --> 32:41.781
and arrest you.
You gotta go.

32:41.849 --> 32:44.117
I trusted you.

32:44.185 --> 32:45.085
And I'm here
to make it right.

32:45.153 --> 32:49.256
We don't have much time.

32:49.324 --> 32:52.392
Okay, okay.
Just let me grab some stuff.

32:58.733 --> 33:00.567
Dylan?

33:07.376 --> 33:09.577
What the hell?

33:19.022 --> 33:20.856
What are you doing?

33:29.267 --> 33:32.569
Oh, my God.

33:32.636 --> 33:33.703
You're the source.

33:33.771 --> 33:37.607
He's mine.

33:37.674 --> 33:41.343
I'm his Alpha now.

33:41.411 --> 33:42.545
No, we're getting out
of here.

33:42.612 --> 33:43.579
We are leaving.

33:43.647 --> 33:45.848
No.

33:45.916 --> 33:48.484
Come on.
I'm gonna get you out of here.

33:48.552 --> 33:49.886
I wanna be with him.

33:49.954 --> 33:50.987
He's using you.

33:51.055 --> 33:52.288
He's going to kill you.

33:53.824 --> 33:54.924
She'll be fine, kitty Kat.

33:54.992 --> 33:58.728
She's my golden goose.

33:58.796 --> 34:01.697
I'll take care of her,
just like I took care of you.

34:06.470 --> 34:10.106
You're such a boy scout.

34:10.174 --> 34:13.676
You're always getting pissed off
about something.

34:13.744 --> 34:16.312
And I always find you,
after you forget.

34:21.418 --> 34:22.452
We'll do this again.

34:22.518 --> 34:25.489
We always do.

34:25.556 --> 34:28.257
Couple of months from now,
you'll be back in my bed.

34:33.456 --> 34:34.623
Kat.

34:35.108 --> 34:36.742
Kat!

34:36.810 --> 34:39.143
Kat, come on, get up.

34:39.212 --> 34:40.378
Get up.

34:40.446 --> 34:41.545
You weren't answering
your earbud,

34:41.614 --> 34:43.047
so I-I came for you.

34:43.114 --> 34:44.482
I got your six.

34:44.516 --> 34:46.384
- Oh, thanks, Gare.
- Yeah.

34:49.187 --> 34:50.121
He's getting away.

34:50.188 --> 34:51.589
I called the police,

34:51.657 --> 34:53.123
but they're not here ye--
oh, no, don't do that!

34:53.190 --> 34:54.958
Those are drugs.
Come on.

34:55.025 --> 34:56.726
Kat, that's drugs.
Don't do drugs!

34:56.795 --> 34:59.563
Bill said no drugs, Kat.
Get in. Get in.

34:59.631 --> 35:01.365
Come on, kick in.

35:01.432 --> 35:03.566
Come on!

35:03.634 --> 35:05.669
Screw it!

35:07.939 --> 35:10.040
Oh, oh!
Reconsider.

35:10.107 --> 35:11.875
Whoa, whoa, no--oh-oh!

35:33.598 --> 35:36.900
Never touch me again.

35:53.817 --> 35:57.253
Well, um,
have a good flight.

36:01.225 --> 36:02.459
- See you in a bit.
- Yeah.

36:02.526 --> 36:03.560
Come on.

36:15.640 --> 36:16.773
Hey, hey, easy tiger.

36:16.841 --> 36:19.076
Excuse--

36:19.143 --> 36:20.744
easy.

36:20.812 --> 36:22.146
I didn't have anything
with him.

36:22.213 --> 36:26.016
Just his piece of Alpha ass.

36:26.084 --> 36:28.085
Well, the good thing
is that you won't even remember

36:28.152 --> 36:29.286
in a couple weeks, right?

36:29.354 --> 36:30.421
Yeah, that's the problem.

36:30.489 --> 36:32.490
I'm the perfect mark.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.691
Who knows what the hell
he had me learn

36:33.759 --> 36:35.293
to make him a few bucks?

36:35.361 --> 36:36.628
Well, according to him,

36:36.696 --> 36:38.030
he could never get you
to do anything too crazy.

36:38.097 --> 36:42.100
Just pick a couple of pockets
or rewire some alarms.

36:42.168 --> 36:43.468
Did you beat that
out of him?

36:43.536 --> 36:45.437
No.

36:45.505 --> 36:47.973
I told him that, uh, I'd give
you another shot at him.

36:50.343 --> 36:51.143
Thanks.

36:55.949 --> 36:58.450
For a second, I thought
that actually meant something.

36:58.518 --> 36:59.651
Probably wasn't even mine.

36:59.719 --> 37:02.187
It's yours now.

37:02.254 --> 37:03.355
Why don't you let that
be a memento

37:03.422 --> 37:06.724
of your first time
undercover.

37:06.792 --> 37:11.330
All right?

37:11.397 --> 37:12.497
Oh, no, come on.
Mmm.

37:12.565 --> 37:13.965
Come on, come on.
Ah, nah, nah.

37:14.033 --> 37:15.467
Shouldn't do that.
That's inappropriate.

37:15.535 --> 37:17.202
We don't squeeze other agents.

37:17.269 --> 37:18.937
Oh, good thing I'm not
a real agent then, huh?

37:19.004 --> 37:20.338
Speaking of which,

37:20.406 --> 37:23.441
I can no longer send
an untrained

37:23.508 --> 37:27.244
and undisciplined civilian
into the field.

37:27.312 --> 37:28.712
Quantico's FBI Academy.

37:28.780 --> 37:29.813
Now, normally,
this program takes

37:29.880 --> 37:31.914
about two years to complete.

37:31.982 --> 37:33.349
I pulled some strings.

37:33.417 --> 37:35.584
I think you can tackle it
in about...two weeks?

37:37.754 --> 37:39.254
- Oh, thank you!
- All right.

37:39.322 --> 37:40.589
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

37:40.656 --> 37:41.856
I didn't hear a yes.
Is that a yes?

37:41.924 --> 37:43.291
- Oh, thank you, Gary!
- Oh, no, don't--no.

37:43.359 --> 37:44.359
Don't do that to me.
No, I don't like that.

37:44.427 --> 37:45.593
Ooh, Gary!

37:45.661 --> 37:47.062
You're squeezing my six.
Come on.

37:47.129 --> 37:49.764
Grow up.

38:07.415 --> 38:09.917
Dad! Uh, what are you
doing here?

38:09.985 --> 38:13.587
He isn't coming, Dani.

38:13.655 --> 38:15.022
I don't know what
you're talking about.

38:15.090 --> 38:16.190
I
Parish.

38:16.257 --> 38:18.592
He's not coming.

38:18.660 --> 38:20.127
I sent the message.

38:23.898 --> 38:25.265
You think you know everything.

38:25.332 --> 38:27.033
No, no, I don't.

38:27.100 --> 38:28.768
You don't know him.

38:28.835 --> 38:30.269
You don't know me.

38:30.337 --> 38:32.671
Well, I know enough right now
to know that if you keep--

38:32.739 --> 38:34.840
I was on the street
when he found me.

38:34.908 --> 38:37.910
Okay, I-I was...Nothing.

38:37.977 --> 38:39.111
I was screwing guys

38:39.179 --> 38:41.780
for a bag of dope, Dad.
$10.

38:41.848 --> 38:44.016
Okay, that--that's who I am.

38:44.084 --> 38:47.621
I am your father, Dani.
That's why I am here.

38:47.688 --> 38:48.755
I want to help you.

38:48.822 --> 38:51.157
I don't need your help.

38:51.225 --> 38:54.060
I didn't do this
to hurt you.

38:54.127 --> 38:55.661
He said he would
bring us together.

38:55.729 --> 38:57.196
That's never
going to happen.

39:05.073 --> 39:07.541
Please, Dani, don't run.
Don't.

39:07.609 --> 39:09.777
What did you do?

39:09.845 --> 39:12.380
I just need you to be safe.

39:12.448 --> 39:17.085
Dani...I need
to see your hands.

39:17.153 --> 39:19.554
Dani, show me your hands.

39:19.622 --> 39:21.923
John, the guns
aren't necessary.

39:21.991 --> 39:25.059
Dr. Rosen, I've got this.
Back off!

39:25.127 --> 39:26.694
Dani, I have to take you
into custody now.

39:26.762 --> 39:28.429
I want you to put
your hands on your head.

39:28.497 --> 39:31.632
I want you to lay face down.

39:52.806 --> 39:54.174
What the hell
is wrong with you, hmm?

39:54.241 --> 39:55.508
Cameron--

39:55.576 --> 39:56.910
You turned her in!

39:56.977 --> 39:58.878
Please, understand,
if I had any other option,

39:58.946 --> 40:00.346
I would have exercised it.
She's your kid!

40:00.414 --> 40:02.014
You're supposed to
protect her.

40:11.558 --> 40:13.626
You were supposed to
protect her.

40:23.705 --> 40:27.741
I just really feel like
I should have seen it.

40:27.808 --> 40:30.576
None of us did.

40:30.644 --> 40:33.546
I mean, not even Rosen.

40:33.614 --> 40:35.682
He must be heartbroken.

40:35.750 --> 40:37.517
No, hearts don't really break.

40:37.585 --> 40:39.186
They can stop,

40:39.254 --> 40:41.689
and they can leak,
but they can't really break.

40:41.757 --> 40:43.391
It just--it gets tired.

40:43.459 --> 40:45.593
Gives up after a while.

41:09.551 --> 41:11.819
Dani, I know how difficult
this must be for you.

41:11.887 --> 41:13.988
No.

41:14.056 --> 41:17.892
No, it's a relief.

41:17.959 --> 41:20.595
Dad...

41:20.662 --> 41:21.729
Dad, can you do something
for me?

41:21.797 --> 41:26.201
Of course.

41:26.269 --> 41:29.038
Tell them to put me
in building seven.

41:29.105 --> 41:31.073
Put a chip in my head.

41:31.141 --> 41:34.844
Oh, God, Dani.

41:34.912 --> 41:35.978
- Please, dad, please.
- Oh, my God, no.

41:36.046 --> 41:37.113
I just want to forget.

41:37.181 --> 41:38.348
I want to disappear.

41:38.415 --> 41:40.850
No!

41:40.918 --> 41:43.620
I'm not gonna do that.

41:43.687 --> 41:45.822
Dani, that--
that's not gonna happen.

41:52.496 --> 41:54.564
Listen.

41:54.632 --> 41:56.499
This--this isn't
the end, Dani.

41:56.567 --> 42:00.270
It's--

42:00.338 --> 42:01.771
There's an opportunity here.

42:01.839 --> 42:03.773
It--

42:03.841 --> 42:08.111
yes, yes, there is a way out.

42:08.179 --> 42:09.613
I don't want a way out.

42:09.680 --> 42:14.585
Will you--will you please
listen to me, please?

42:14.653 --> 42:17.488
Please, Dani.
