There's energon here, but it's too deep to access.

Dead end.

00:52.719 --> 00:56.389
As dead ends go, at least this one has a view.

Ah. Are you telling me that we spent all day

00:59.225 --> 01:02.162
yomping up here just to enjoy the scenery?

Predacons. Up there.

Optimus, maximize!

01:23.249 --> 01:25.819
Nowhere to run and no place to hide.

02:01.754 --> 02:05.058
Attack! We storm their position.

RATTRAP: You're on the wrong wavelength there, lizard lips.

02:07.861 --> 02:09.896
We run!

02:09.996 --> 02:11.664
Oh, yes.

02:11.764 --> 02:15.335
And just where do we run, rodent?

03:07.186 --> 03:08.688
I'll cover the rear.

Well done, old friend.

Steady nerves and quick thinking.

03:14.194 --> 03:15.595
Comes with the job description.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.297
No, I'm serious.

03:17.397 --> 03:20.099
If you ever wanted to, you'd make one prime leader.

03:20.200 --> 03:23.403
Thanks anyway, but I'll leave that sort of thing to you.

03:23.503 --> 03:27.507
I'd rather just tag along behind and smell the flowers.

03:39.619 --> 03:43.756
I do believe I may have underestimated him. Yes.

03:43.856 --> 03:47.894

04:56.963 --> 05:00.233
But infinitely well worth the effort, Maximal,

05:00.333 --> 05:04.537
as you are about to discover. Yes.

05:10.243 --> 05:14.847
If I can just patch in, I can activate his comm link.

05:14.947 --> 05:17.150
I say we just go after him.

05:17.250 --> 05:18.885
Cool your circuits, Cheetor.

05:18.985 --> 05:21.654
First, we have to find out where he is.

05:21.754 --> 05:23.589
Ehh. I got it.

06:40.633 --> 06:42.401
Oh, man.

06:42.502 --> 06:45.938
Indeed. Most ominous.

06:46.038 --> 06:48.407
It alters the balance of power.

06:48.508 --> 06:51.144
I'm talking about what it does to Rhinox.

06:51.244 --> 06:54.013
Better dead than Pred.

06:54.113 --> 06:57.083
Some of us have survived the experience,

06:57.183 --> 06:59.886
furball.

06:59.986 --> 07:01.420
I can't get it back.

07:01.521 --> 07:04.123
We're too far away and there's too much interference.

07:04.223 --> 07:06.692
We'll have to get closer to the Predacon base.

07:06.793 --> 07:08.161
Yeah. Real close.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.062
Like through the gates with lasers blazing!

07:10.163 --> 07:11.464
Negative.

07:11.564 --> 07:14.267
We don't have the forces for a full-scale assault.

07:14.367 --> 07:16.869
Yeah, but the kid's got a point.

07:16.969 --> 07:19.138
Man, we can't just leave my pal in there.

07:19.238 --> 07:20.706
Oh, yes we can.

07:20.807 --> 07:23.209
That's exactly what we're going to do.

07:23.309 --> 07:25.144
Oh, good-- What?!

07:25.244 --> 07:29.515
Optimus! You got a few bugs in your systems directory?

07:29.615 --> 07:31.751
No. But I've got a hunch

07:31.851 --> 07:33.753
that Megatron's bitten off a little more

07:33.853 --> 07:36.088
than he bargained for.

07:36.189 --> 07:39.091
Yes.

07:39.192 --> 07:42.094
( ominous theme playing )

07:43.529 --> 07:45.731
RHINOX: Nice little setup, chief.

07:45.832 --> 07:49.001
I think I'm gonna feel right at home.

07:49.101 --> 07:51.771
And now that you've toured our base,

07:51.871 --> 07:53.806
to business.

07:55.575 --> 07:58.377
Your former lodgings, Rhinox.

07:58.477 --> 08:02.215
And you have intimate knowledge of the defense systems.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.183
Knowledge which will

08:04.283 --> 08:08.421
prove most valuable. Yes.

08:08.521 --> 08:11.190
And what's in this for me?

08:11.290 --> 08:14.026
The satisfaction of having played a leading role

08:14.126 --> 08:17.463
in the destruction of your former comrades.

08:17.563 --> 08:19.765
Destruction.

08:19.866 --> 08:23.002
Yep. Destruction is always good.

08:24.637 --> 08:25.671
( groans )

08:25.771 --> 08:27.173
Something wrong?

08:27.273 --> 08:29.108
There must be a malfunction

08:29.208 --> 08:32.812
of the image decompression protocol array.

08:32.912 --> 08:35.648
Gee. Hope it's under warranty.

08:35.748 --> 08:37.450
( growls )

08:48.127 --> 08:51.364
The chief wants to know how long this is gonna take.

08:51.464 --> 08:55.668
Tell him not to get his software in a snarl.

08:55.768 --> 08:59.272
First, I have to figure out what the slaggin' problem is.

09:01.107 --> 09:06.178
Hang on. The redactor modem's missing.

09:06.279 --> 09:09.782
No. You shock me, Scorponok.

09:09.882 --> 09:11.784
( muttering )

09:18.891 --> 09:21.160
RHINOX: Scorponok.

09:21.260 --> 09:22.895
Over here.

09:22.995 --> 09:25.398
( suspenseful theme playing )

09:27.833 --> 09:29.902
Hey, hey, hey!

09:30.002 --> 09:31.637
You wanna be careful there.

09:31.737 --> 09:34.240
Oh, I'm being real careful.

09:34.340 --> 09:36.609
See, I'm on this side.

09:36.709 --> 09:39.745
And it's all gonna fall that way.

09:39.845 --> 09:42.748
( yelling )

09:43.849 --> 09:45.418
( grunts )

09:50.256 --> 09:52.124
Idiot. What have you done?

09:54.260 --> 09:56.696
WASPINATOR: Hmm.

09:56.796 --> 09:59.532
The idiot does not respond.

09:59.632 --> 10:02.001
The idiot is trauma-toast.

10:02.101 --> 10:04.537
MEGATRON: Get him to the restoration chamber.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.093
Heads up.

10:27.193 --> 10:29.362
( grunting )

10:34.834 --> 10:37.903
So this is the game.

10:38.004 --> 10:40.673
( panting )

10:40.773 --> 10:43.376
Destroy all Autobots.

10:43.476 --> 10:45.945
Bot-- Bot-- Bot--

10:47.513 --> 10:50.716
Waspinator, what are you buzzing about?

10:50.816 --> 10:53.753
Waspinator. Negative, negative, negative.

10:53.853 --> 10:58.124
I am Shrapnel, Decepticon hero-- Oh, oh, oh.

10:58.224 --> 11:01.327
Shrapnel? That was a Decepticon from the great wars,

11:01.427 --> 11:03.429
three centuries ago.

11:03.529 --> 11:04.797
He's wacko.

11:04.897 --> 11:05.898
Wacko?

11:05.998 --> 11:10.836
No, Wonko. Wonko, the sane!

11:13.272 --> 11:15.675
( dramatic theme playing )

11:26.052 --> 11:27.887
Look who's here.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.389
Our loyal friend.

11:30.489 --> 11:33.993
Is that supposed to mean something?

11:34.093 --> 11:38.197
Deep-six the big wide-eyes routine.

11:38.297 --> 11:41.534
You're trying to destabilize the whole operation

11:41.634 --> 11:44.637
so you can knock off Megatron and take over.

11:44.737 --> 11:49.542
Well, I got news for you, pal.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.711
I like this plan. So here's the deal.

11:52.812 --> 11:55.347
You and me. Equal partners.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.050
No. Here's the deal.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.252
( choking )

12:00.352 --> 12:02.421
You're gonna keep your big beak shut.

12:02.521 --> 12:04.557
And do exactly what I tell you.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.225
Because one false move

12:06.325 --> 12:09.195
and you're a new fast-food sensation:

12:09.295 --> 12:12.598
Pterodactyl hot wings. Get it?

12:13.966 --> 12:15.134
Got it.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.136
Good.

12:17.236 --> 12:19.705
( panting )

12:19.805 --> 12:21.707
( coughs )

12:24.210 --> 12:26.745
( Tarantulas & Blackarachnia groaning )

12:31.117 --> 12:34.787
MEGATRON: Taranatulas? Blackarachnia?

12:34.887 --> 12:37.356
These spiders have been poisoned.

12:39.358 --> 12:41.227
What's going on around here?

12:47.867 --> 12:49.602
Heh-heh. Now I get it.

12:49.702 --> 12:53.339
Leave Rhinox in there and let him create total chaos.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.941
Yes. I was guessing that the transmutation

12:56.041 --> 12:58.878
would push his aggressiveness quotient right off the scale.

12:58.978 --> 13:01.514
And it looks as if I guessed right.

13:01.614 --> 13:04.016
There's just one problem.

13:04.116 --> 13:06.819
Megatron is no one's fool.

13:06.919 --> 13:09.021
Yeah. I mean, pretty soon

13:09.121 --> 13:10.556
he's gonna put two and two together.

13:10.656 --> 13:13.292
And then what happens to Rhinox?

13:15.728 --> 13:17.363
( groaning )

13:17.463 --> 13:19.732
I... I looked up.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.936
Blam.

13:24.036 --> 13:26.839
It seems I made a mistake

13:26.939 --> 13:30.442
by reprogramming the Maximal. Yes.

13:30.543 --> 13:33.679
But fortunately, this can be rectified.

13:33.779 --> 13:36.448
It's time to bring this experiment,

13:36.549 --> 13:39.451
and Rhinox himself, to an end!

13:41.820 --> 13:44.123
( suspenseful theme playing )

13:49.795 --> 13:52.131
We gotta move. And fast.

13:52.231 --> 13:53.933
Not yet. If we intervene now,

13:54.033 --> 13:57.570
we're facing seven Predacons, including Rhinox.

13:57.670 --> 14:01.006
And if we wait, we're facing six Preds.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.776
And a large collection of rhino bits.

14:03.876 --> 14:07.580
He's right. The game is over.

14:07.680 --> 14:09.715
Not quite.

14:09.815 --> 14:13.452
Rhinox and Megatron have one more hand to play:

14:13.552 --> 14:15.521
With each other.

14:15.621 --> 14:19.225
We'll move in closer, but then we'll hold our position.

14:19.325 --> 14:21.927
Until I give the word.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.263
( dramatic theme playing )

14:26.699 --> 14:29.001
MEGATRON: Rhinox.

14:32.037 --> 14:34.773
Such a pleasure to see you, Rhinox.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.910
Always a treat to see you too.

14:38.010 --> 14:39.111
Traitor.

14:39.211 --> 14:41.046
Yep. You got a point there.

14:41.146 --> 14:42.548
In which case...

14:42.648 --> 14:45.251
Rhinox, terrorize!

14:45.351 --> 14:48.153
( roars )

14:48.254 --> 14:51.924
They're playing our song, Megatron.

14:52.024 --> 14:54.793
Time to dance.

14:54.893 --> 14:57.463
Oh, I do so hate to disappoint.

14:57.563 --> 15:01.500
But you won't mind if I sit this one out.

15:04.136 --> 15:07.406
Scorponok, terrorize!

15:07.506 --> 15:09.942
Terrorsaur, terrorize!

15:10.042 --> 15:14.880
Oh? You're back on their side now?

15:14.980 --> 15:17.016
Gee, a guy can hardly keep track.

15:17.116 --> 15:18.550
( coughs )

15:18.651 --> 15:20.753
What's he talking about?

15:20.853 --> 15:22.421
Uh, don't listen to him.

15:22.521 --> 15:24.556
When I slagged you and bug eyes,

15:24.657 --> 15:27.459
he was watching and smirking.

15:27.559 --> 15:29.128
TERRORSAUR: Th-- That's a lie.

15:29.228 --> 15:32.665
RHINOX: Then how come you're looking so shifty all of a sudden?

15:32.765 --> 15:35.067
( screaming )

15:36.468 --> 15:38.771
TERRORSAUR: I am not-- He's a smirker.

15:38.871 --> 15:40.172
( laughs )

15:40.272 --> 15:41.774
( yells )

15:41.874 --> 15:44.076
( grunts )

15:44.176 --> 15:45.744
( screeches )

15:48.080 --> 15:52.217
No. Idiots! He's the enemy.

15:53.619 --> 15:56.288
( grunts )

15:56.388 --> 15:58.090
( Rhinox cackling )

16:02.594 --> 16:04.063
( both thud )

16:06.765 --> 16:08.334
( grunting )

16:14.340 --> 16:16.675
Well, what do you know?

16:16.775 --> 16:18.310
I win.

16:21.480 --> 16:25.284
Reprogramming me was the worst mistake you ever made.

16:25.384 --> 16:27.252
Because now that I'm a Predacon,

16:27.353 --> 16:30.089
I'm just a little too crafty for you.

16:30.189 --> 16:33.826
Yes. I see this now.

16:33.926 --> 16:36.028
It's called irony, sport.

16:36.128 --> 16:41.166
I take over and you head straight for the recycling bin.

16:41.266 --> 16:44.002
Yes.

16:44.103 --> 16:47.339
So it would seem. And even now, Rhinox,

16:47.439 --> 16:50.676
you're teaching me a valuable lesson.

16:50.776 --> 16:52.845
Yeah? What's that?

16:52.945 --> 16:56.048
Sometimes, Predacons gloat too much.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.420
( screams )

17:02.721 --> 17:05.057
Wh-- What happened?

17:05.157 --> 17:06.558
Maximum buffoon.

17:08.894 --> 17:10.629
You thought you'd outwit me?

17:10.729 --> 17:12.998
( alarm wailing ) Aah!

17:13.098 --> 17:14.733
OPTIMUS: Maximize!

17:14.833 --> 17:18.504
( all growling )

17:18.604 --> 17:20.873
Okay, so how about we just punt your butt

17:20.973 --> 17:23.642
a couple of hundred yards downfield?

17:25.778 --> 17:27.312
( muttering )

17:27.413 --> 17:29.782
Decepticons, attack! Attack!

17:57.743 --> 17:59.111

18:02.281 --> 18:04.082

( screams )

19:07.746 --> 19:09.615
It's gonna blow!

19:09.715 --> 19:12.451
Predacons, take cover.

19:12.551 --> 19:15.654
Dinobot! Grab Rhinox and let's go, go, go!

19:15.754 --> 19:18.924
No. This is our chance to take command of the base.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.192
That's an order!

19:20.292 --> 19:23.228
( whistles ) Yo, everybody out of the pool!

( dramatic theme playing )

19:34.039 --> 19:37.142
No. Look, I can explain.

19:37.242 --> 19:41.213
Let me share this with you, Terrorsaur.

19:41.313 --> 19:45.184
I am very, very unhappy indeed.

19:45.284 --> 19:48.320
Oh, yes.

Heaven.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.040
( Optimus laughs )

20:08.140 --> 20:11.209
Good to have you back, Rhinox.

20:11.310 --> 20:12.945
So give us the scoop.

20:13.045 --> 20:15.647
What's it actually feel like being a Pred?

20:15.747 --> 20:19.217
Hmm. Like you're three gigabytes of attitude

20:19.318 --> 20:21.420
on a two gig hard drive.

20:21.520 --> 20:24.723
No wonder they got personality problems.
