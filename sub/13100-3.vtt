'We've been sitting here
for over an hour.'

'Is there a problem? '

00:08.000 --> 00:09.125
(male #1)
'We've instituted new policies'

00:09.208 --> 00:10.375
'to screen for weapons.'

00:10.458 --> 00:12.167
'It's slowing down processing.'

00:12.250 --> 00:14.250
'Captain's meeting with
the Transport Association now'

00:14.333 --> 00:15.417
'to work it out.'

00:15.500 --> 00:17.250
'I'm sure it won't
be a problem.'

00:18.667 --> 00:20.167
Please, just..

00:20.250 --> 00:22.417
Can we have some order here,
please?

[whistles]

00:28.042 --> 00:29.500
Thank you.

00:29.583 --> 00:32.417
Now, I realize that
it's gonna take longer now

00:32.500 --> 00:34.375
to get your material
through customs.

00:34.458 --> 00:37.792
We project delays of no more
than ten to fifteen percent.

00:37.875 --> 00:40.917
[all shouting]

00:42.667 --> 00:44.750
Look, we can get that
delayed down to five percent

00:44.833 --> 00:46.792
if we put on more inspectors.

00:46.875 --> 00:48.708
But that's gonna raise
your docking fees.

00:48.792 --> 00:51.667
[all shouting]

00:51.750 --> 00:53.583
The hell with the money.

00:53.667 --> 00:55.792
We know why you're
really doing this.

00:55.875 --> 00:57.208
They want to control
all the weapons

00:57.292 --> 00:59.583
so they can push us around,
intimidate us.

01:01.875 --> 01:05.625
Weapons make you a big man,
don't they, Sheridan?

01:05.708 --> 01:07.250
'You're pretty brave
sitting up there'

01:07.333 --> 01:09.500
'with armed guards
on either side.'

01:09.583 --> 01:12.250
Us down here, all we got..

01:13.875 --> 01:15.792
...is what we got.

01:15.875 --> 01:18.125
Why don't you come down here
and try this crap?

01:18.208 --> 01:19.750
That'll be enough.

01:19.833 --> 01:21.750
'That's the real reason you
don't want guns around here.'

01:21.833 --> 01:23.708
Because you're a damn coward.

01:23.792 --> 01:27.042
Without a gun to back you up,
you got nothing.

01:29.208 --> 01:32.208
[intense music]

01:51.875 --> 01:53.458
You got the gun.

01:55.208 --> 01:59.292
All I've got is what I've got.

01:59.375 --> 02:01.500
No way.

02:01.583 --> 02:03.833
I drop you and
your guards will kill me.

02:03.917 --> 02:05.833
Maybe. Maybe not.

02:05.917 --> 02:07.417
Hell, anything happens to me

02:07.500 --> 02:09.792
everyone gets
an instant promotion.

02:12.167 --> 02:14.625
You got the gun.
Go ahead, go for it.

02:15.792 --> 02:17.583
I'll wait for you.

02:22.417 --> 02:24.292
Look.

02:25.958 --> 02:28.458
I was just talking,
I didn't mean nothing.

[music continues]

02:44.542 --> 02:46.625
Commander Ivanova

02:46.708 --> 02:49.625
we've been going
at this all day.

02:49.708 --> 02:51.417
[sighs]

02:51.500 --> 02:54.542
I recommend we adjourn
until tomorrow..

02:54.625 --> 02:56.833
...when cooler heads..

02:56.917 --> 02:58.583
...can prevail.

03:00.042 --> 03:02.125
Adjourned.

03:02.208 --> 03:04.042
[indistinct chatter]

03:06.333 --> 03:09.000
With all due respect..

03:09.083 --> 03:10.250
That was Grade A stupid.

03:10.333 --> 03:11.792
I mean, what if the guy
would've gone for it?

03:11.875 --> 03:13.375
'What if he would just have
blown your brains'

03:13.458 --> 03:16.250
all over the place?
I mean, what if he..

03:16.333 --> 03:18.042
What's that?

03:18.125 --> 03:19.542
Energy cap.

03:19.625 --> 03:22.125
I palmed it when I shoved
the gun in his pocket.

03:25.000 --> 03:27.750
You are going to give me
an ulcer.

03:27.833 --> 03:29.792
Okay, okay, next time
I'll give him a live gun.

03:29.875 --> 03:31.333
You really do want
that promotion.

03:31.417 --> 03:33.750
- Next time you're gonna--
- Captain Sheridan.

03:35.542 --> 03:37.000
Counselor Na'Far.

03:37.083 --> 03:39.250
'I've just arrived and wanted
to check in with you.'

03:39.333 --> 03:42.750
I'm here to replace
Citizen G'Kar.

03:49.667 --> 03:54.292
(Susan)
The Babylon Project was our
last, best hope for peace.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.458
It failed.

04:00.417 --> 04:02.250
[theme music]

04:14.292 --> 04:16.000
But in the year
of the Shadow War

04:16.083 --> 04:18.333
it became something greater..

04:18.417 --> 04:21.667
Our last, best hope
for victory.

04:26.583 --> 04:31.875
The year is 2260.
The place, Babylon 5.

'When the Centauri conquered
our world'

05:22.958 --> 05:24.375
they disbanded our government

05:24.458 --> 05:27.708
and created a new one
under their control.

05:27.792 --> 05:32.667
Citizen G'Kar is the only member
of the Kha'ri still free.

05:32.750 --> 05:34.125
We've given him sanctuary.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.667
He can remain here
as long as he wants.

05:35.750 --> 05:37.417
Yes, but unfortunately

05:37.500 --> 05:41.875
he remains in a position of
authority with our people here.

05:41.958 --> 05:44.583
The Centauri believe
he is using his influence

05:44.667 --> 05:48.333
to create an armed resistance
back home.

05:48.417 --> 05:50.333
Well, I don't see the problem.

05:50.417 --> 05:52.750
Don't you want
the Centauri off your world?

05:55.542 --> 06:00.417
My concern is for the welfare
of all of my people.

06:02.125 --> 06:06.417
The resistance is causing
great problems for the Centauri.

06:06.500 --> 06:11.375
For every one of them we kill,
they kill 500 of us.

06:13.125 --> 06:15.583
We must cool things down.

06:15.667 --> 06:19.583
The time for action
will come later.

06:19.667 --> 06:21.833
The provisional government
has authorized me

06:21.917 --> 06:25.083
to take charge
of the local Narn population

06:25.167 --> 06:28.958
and to ask for your assistance
in returning Citizen G'Kar.

06:31.375 --> 06:33.333
[sighs]
I'm sorry, Na'Far..

06:35.333 --> 06:38.667
I have to deny your request.

06:38.750 --> 06:40.958
I won't interfere
in Narn internal affairs

06:41.042 --> 06:44.625
and I won't make G'Kar go
anywhere he doesn't want to go.

06:44.708 --> 06:47.042
You two will have to work
that out between you.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.917
Well, thank you for your time,
captain.

06:52.250 --> 06:54.000
Commander.

06:59.458 --> 07:01.667
[instrumental music]

07:04.917 --> 07:06.667
(Michael)
'So, this Brakiri,
he's following me around.'

07:06.750 --> 07:09.333
'He's busting my chops about
how there's not enough security'

07:09.417 --> 07:11.917
in the Alien Sector,
and he will not go away.

07:12.000 --> 07:14.292
So, finally, I point down the
hall and say, "Look! A comet!"

07:14.375 --> 07:16.167
And I dive into the nearest
transport tube.

07:16.250 --> 07:17.833
Subtle. Very subtle.

07:17.917 --> 07:20.500
Except later on
I find out that a comet

07:20.583 --> 07:22.500
is a major Brakiri death symbol.

07:22.583 --> 07:25.000
So, now, he's putting his affair
in order and pressing charges

07:25.083 --> 07:28.750
saying that I threatened him,
his family and his water-clan

07:28.833 --> 07:30.875
whatever the hell that is.

07:33.042 --> 07:36.333
Stephen, she went by again.

07:36.417 --> 07:37.667
Now, go on, ask her
to dance, already.

07:37.750 --> 07:39.250
What are you waiting for,
an invitation?

07:39.333 --> 07:42.292
- Come on, Michael, I'm bushed.
- So it'll be a quick dance.

07:42.375 --> 07:44.208
Hey, commander, there you are.

07:44.292 --> 07:45.750
I got tied up in a meeting
with the captain

07:45.833 --> 07:48.542
and a new rep from Narn.

07:48.625 --> 07:50.208
Oh, you look whacked.

07:50.292 --> 07:53.708
Twenty hours without a break.
The usual.

07:53.792 --> 07:56.583
- How's the captain?
- He's fine. Why?

07:56.667 --> 08:00.917
Well, I was telling Michael,
he seems a lot more..

08:01.000 --> 08:02.875
I don't know, hard-assed lately.

08:02.958 --> 08:05.500
Oh, with everything that's
going on, who wouldn't be?

08:05.583 --> 08:08.208
When the captain first got here,
he just tried to fit in.

08:08.292 --> 08:09.417
Now he's trying
to make this place

08:09.500 --> 08:10.917
more like what he's used to.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.375
'Right now we need
a good soldier'

08:12.458 --> 08:14.208
'a hell of a lot more
than a diplomat.'

08:14.292 --> 08:17.750
Yeah, well, right now
what I need to do is use..

08:17.833 --> 08:19.792
[instrument beeps]

08:19.875 --> 08:21.708
[sighs]

08:22.833 --> 08:24.250
Franklin.

08:24.333 --> 08:26.250
(male #2)
'Dr. Kobiyama
just called in sick.'

08:26.333 --> 08:27.750
'He says he can't take
the next shift.'

08:27.833 --> 08:29.792
'Can you sit in for a while?'

08:29.875 --> 08:31.417
[sighs]
What about Dr. Morales?

08:31.500 --> 08:33.583
'She's in Med Three
in heavy isolation'

08:33.667 --> 08:36.708
'and can't leave until she's
gone through decontamination.'

08:36.792 --> 08:39.167
- Alright, when do you need me?
- 'Two hours.'

08:40.125 --> 08:41.583
I'll be there.

08:43.125 --> 08:46.250
Never slows down around
this place, now, does it?

08:46.333 --> 08:47.958
I'm gonna use the little
officers' room

08:48.042 --> 08:50.417
I'll be right back.

08:50.500 --> 08:51.708
Wow.

08:52.958 --> 08:54.500
Hey, did I ever tell you

08:54.583 --> 08:56.708
I looked through the captain's
personnel file?

08:56.792 --> 08:58.750
- You what?
- Shh.

08:58.833 --> 09:00.875
Michael, that information
is strictly off-limits.

09:00.958 --> 09:02.208
I did it when
he first came aboard.

09:02.292 --> 09:03.833
I like to know
who I'm dealing with.

09:03.917 --> 09:06.708
And who knew he'd turn out
to be okay, huh?

09:06.792 --> 09:08.375
Alright, now,
according to his file

09:08.458 --> 09:10.083
Sheridan's a good
tactical thinker.

09:10.167 --> 09:11.833
He can take an inferior
defensive force

09:11.917 --> 09:13.292
and turn it into
an offensive force

09:13.375 --> 09:15.708
capable of taking on
a better equipped enemy.

09:15.792 --> 09:18.667
He did it with the Black Star.
He did it during the Mars riots.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.583
You ask me, he's the one chance
we've got

09:20.667 --> 09:22.792
to make it
through this thing alive.

09:22.875 --> 09:25.333
Maybe.

09:25.417 --> 09:27.500
Did you look through my files
when I came onboard?

09:27.583 --> 09:32.208
Commander, that information
is strictly off-limits.

09:32.292 --> 09:34.000
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

09:35.625 --> 09:37.500
- Whoo! Where you going?
- Gotta go.

09:37.583 --> 09:38.750
Alright, I've got two hours

09:38.833 --> 09:40.375
before I have
to be back on duty.

09:40.458 --> 09:42.167
I'm gonna go ask that little
lady to dance after all.

09:42.250 --> 09:45.000
So you watch my back,
Michael, I'm going in.

09:45.083 --> 09:46.333
[instrumental music]

09:46.417 --> 09:48.208
Oh, yeah.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.542
After speaking
with Captain Sheridan

10:01.625 --> 10:03.708
I was told to report to you

10:03.792 --> 10:07.167
prior to contacting
G'Kar directly.

10:07.250 --> 10:08.792
May I now proceed?

10:10.417 --> 10:13.833
You know,
I was thinking of visiting

10:13.917 --> 10:16.708
your world sometime soon.

10:16.792 --> 10:19.333
I couldn't really get
a good look at it

10:19.417 --> 10:21.458
the last time I was in the area.

10:21.542 --> 10:25.542
Do you think it would be safe
for someone such as myself

10:25.625 --> 10:27.292
to visit your world now?

10:27.375 --> 10:31.375
Yes. Quite safe.

10:31.458 --> 10:36.375
The streets are kept clear
of troublemakers

10:36.458 --> 10:38.875
rock throwers, protesters?

10:38.958 --> 10:45.625
The surviving streets
are quite empty, ambassador.

10:45.708 --> 10:50.458
The work farms,
the relocation camps

10:50.542 --> 10:56.792
the construction gangs
are all operating at capacity?

10:58.917 --> 11:00.792
Hmm.

11:06.833 --> 11:09.833
And the executions, Na'Far?

11:09.917 --> 11:12.500
The executions continue?

11:12.583 --> 11:16.292
The executions...continue.

11:18.750 --> 11:20.583
Progress.

11:21.958 --> 11:24.833
It's a beautiful thing
to behold, no, Vir?

11:26.958 --> 11:31.250
You may contact G'Kar, now.

11:31.333 --> 11:33.417
Go, go.

11:38.792 --> 11:40.833
Was that necessary?

11:40.917 --> 11:42.667
They got out
of their place once.

11:42.750 --> 11:45.083
We must make sure
it doesn't happen again.

11:45.167 --> 11:46.833
Londo, we've beaten them.

11:46.917 --> 11:50.042
Their cities are in ashes,
their military is wiped out.

11:50.125 --> 11:52.125
They've lost hundreds
and thousands of lives.

11:52.208 --> 11:53.792
They have nothing left!

11:53.875 --> 11:56.125
No. There you are wrong.

11:56.208 --> 11:58.458
They still have their pride.

11:58.542 --> 12:02.625
He tries to hide it, this one,
but I can see it in his eyes.

12:02.708 --> 12:06.583
As long as it remains,
they will always be a threat.

12:06.667 --> 12:09.542
So is that
what it's about? Pride?

12:09.625 --> 12:11.167
It's not enough that
we've beaten them?

12:11.250 --> 12:14.250
- We have to break them?
- Yes.

12:14.333 --> 12:16.375
I'm sorry,
I thought you understood that.

12:16.458 --> 12:18.750
I don't want our people
to go through this again

12:18.833 --> 12:20.333
in another 100 years.

12:20.417 --> 12:23.625
It is the way things are done,
Vir.

12:23.708 --> 12:25.708
Nothing personal.

12:25.792 --> 12:28.292
[instrumental music]

12:31.958 --> 12:34.625
We've been monitoring it
for the past hour, captain.

12:34.708 --> 12:37.667
Ever since it entered
Babylon 5 space.

12:37.750 --> 12:38.958
Distance?

12:39.042 --> 12:40.917
It's a little over 5000 klicks.

12:41.000 --> 12:42.250
We sent a security-bot
to check it out.

12:42.333 --> 12:44.208
Should be in range by now.

12:46.542 --> 12:48.542
Signature and configuration

12:48.625 --> 12:51.500
it's like nothing
we've seen before.

12:51.583 --> 12:54.083
Looks like we've got a first
contact situation, captain.

12:54.167 --> 12:56.750
[intense music]

13:02.458 --> 13:04.417
[intense music]

13:04.500 --> 13:07.083
(David)
'Alien vessel coming to relative
stop, captain.'

13:07.167 --> 13:10.750
- No life signs present.
- Weapons?

13:10.833 --> 13:12.500
None that I can tell.

13:12.583 --> 13:14.875
Must be a science probe
of some kind.

13:17.000 --> 13:19.917
I'm getting a signal,
a recording.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.750
Anything you recognize?

13:21.833 --> 13:23.167
Negative.

13:23.250 --> 13:25.833
Just the same pattern of signals
repeated over and over.

13:25.917 --> 13:27.542
They're probably sending us
their alphabet

13:27.625 --> 13:30.458
and language codes. How long
before the system decodes it?

13:30.542 --> 13:32.167
It's pretty complex, sir.

13:32.250 --> 13:34.875
At least two, three hours.
Maybe more.

13:34.958 --> 13:37.708
And I know that things
have been somewhat..

13:39.083 --> 13:42.042
...difficult between us
for some time Delenn.

13:42.125 --> 13:44.875
That is most unfortunate.

13:44.958 --> 13:49.042
I feel sometimes as though
I have lost a friend.

13:49.125 --> 13:53.625
I think you have lost much more
than a friend, ambassador.

13:53.708 --> 13:57.833
But that is between you
and whatever Gods you worship.

13:57.917 --> 13:59.417
Delenn..

14:01.500 --> 14:04.583
I don't want to argue with you.
Not now.

14:04.667 --> 14:09.583
From time to time in the past,
I have helped you, hmm.

14:09.667 --> 14:14.125
And in return, you said that
if I ever needed a favor

14:14.208 --> 14:15.667
I had only to ask.

14:15.750 --> 14:18.125
- Now I am asking.
- Ambassador..

14:18.208 --> 14:21.375
Don't worry,
it is not for myself.

14:21.458 --> 14:23.750
Not for the Centauri Republic.

14:23.833 --> 14:26.917
It is for Vir.

14:27.000 --> 14:29.833
The Centauri diplomatic mission
to your Homeworld

14:29.917 --> 14:32.917
has been closed for,
what, several years now.

14:33.000 --> 14:36.625
Some trouble, I understand,
with our last envoy.

14:36.708 --> 14:41.583
I think that Vir would be
the perfect replacement.

14:41.667 --> 14:45.292
You will find him
most inoffensive.

14:45.375 --> 14:49.125
He is friendly.
He-he keeps to himself.

14:49.208 --> 14:52.208
He wouldn't even spy
on your government.

14:52.292 --> 14:55.708
He would consider it rude.

14:55.792 --> 14:58.292
What you ask is not impossible.

14:59.750 --> 15:02.750
But I would like to know,
why this particular favor?

15:04.708 --> 15:08.375
I have some concerns
about his development

15:08.458 --> 15:10.500
his career.

15:11.542 --> 15:13.542
It would be a good move for him.

15:13.625 --> 15:15.125
Thank you.

15:15.208 --> 15:17.000
And now the truth.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.125
[sighs]

15:22.208 --> 15:25.458
Well, over the last two years..

15:26.542 --> 15:29.333
...to my considerable surprise..

15:29.417 --> 15:33.333
...I have become
very fond of Vir.

15:33.417 --> 15:36.000
Sometimes in his eyes..

15:36.083 --> 15:40.375
...I see a younger version
of myself, before..

15:43.708 --> 15:49.542
[clicks tongue]
Well, he would be better off
away from here.

15:49.625 --> 15:51.833
Away from what must be.

15:53.083 --> 15:55.250
He would only get in the way.

15:56.667 --> 16:01.042
I think, perhaps,
you need him.

16:01.125 --> 16:05.083
Need? No, I don't need anyone.

16:05.167 --> 16:08.208
He is an inconvenience to me.

16:08.292 --> 16:12.042
A blight, a pox,
a stone around my neck.

16:12.125 --> 16:14.833
Here, I give him to you.

16:17.708 --> 16:19.333
I will see what I can do.

16:21.042 --> 16:23.875
Perhaps, the mission
has been empty too long.

16:23.958 --> 16:26.375
Good.

16:26.458 --> 16:28.042
Well..

16:29.917 --> 16:31.792
I must be going.

16:31.875 --> 16:33.667
Thank you for seeing me, Delenn.

16:37.458 --> 16:40.458
Sometimes I miss..

16:40.542 --> 16:43.042
...that we don't talk anymore,
Delenn.

16:45.292 --> 16:47.542
We never really talked, Londo.

16:49.083 --> 16:50.875
No, I suppose not.

16:53.583 --> 16:56.375
So why the sudden invitation
to dinner?

16:56.458 --> 16:57.917
What, I can't make
a little extra pasta

16:58.000 --> 16:59.458
some cannoli,
I have to have an agenda?

16:59.542 --> 17:01.417
[laughs]
Absolutely.

17:01.500 --> 17:02.625
You know, you're a hard man,
Stephen.

17:02.708 --> 17:04.292
- Now sit, eat, huh?
- Alright.

17:04.375 --> 17:06.292
Before it gets cold.
Thank you.

17:09.167 --> 17:11.250
I was just thinking, you know

17:11.333 --> 17:13.000
we're a lot alike in some ways.

17:13.083 --> 17:14.333
We're both perfectionists.

17:14.417 --> 17:17.042
We make everybody
under us crazy

17:17.125 --> 17:19.083
but we're both good
at what we do.

17:19.167 --> 17:20.750
And the reason we're both good
at what we do

17:20.833 --> 17:23.792
is because
we're obsessive-compulsives.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.708
Of course, there's
a downside to that.

17:25.792 --> 17:27.417
Which is?

17:27.500 --> 17:30.667
Well, you know,
we fall into patterns easy.

17:30.750 --> 17:34.583
You know, tendencies become
habits, habits become vices.

17:34.667 --> 17:37.792
Stop dancing, Michael. You got
something to say, say it.

17:37.875 --> 17:40.167
Alright.

17:40.250 --> 17:42.042
This is a glass of water.

17:42.125 --> 17:44.292
The reason it's a glass of water
and not wine is because

17:44.375 --> 17:46.958
once I start I don't know
where to stop.

17:47.042 --> 17:49.750
The last thing you want to do is
hand an obsessive-compulsive

17:49.833 --> 17:54.500
a drink
or dice or...stims.

17:56.875 --> 18:00.125
You're crazy, Michael.
I don't have a problem.

18:00.208 --> 18:01.958
Back at Earhart's, between
the time when you went off

18:02.042 --> 18:04.458
to the bathroom when you came
back, did you do any stims?

18:04.542 --> 18:07.083
[laughs]
Wh.. Stims are perfectly legal

18:07.167 --> 18:08.667
used by prescription,
in moderation--

18:08.750 --> 18:10.000
That's not what I asked you.

18:10.083 --> 18:11.583
Did you do any stims?

18:13.250 --> 18:15.250
Alright. Yeah.
I mean what of it?

18:15.333 --> 18:16.958
- Stephen--
- 'No, no, wait a minute, now.'

18:17.042 --> 18:19.917
You know, most days I'm on duty
36 hours at a stretch.

18:20.000 --> 18:22.708
Sometimes longer because
we don't have the people

18:22.792 --> 18:24.792
or the resources or the money.

18:24.875 --> 18:26.958
Now, I have to be alert
and I have to be focused

18:27.042 --> 18:28.833
or people die. It's that simple.

18:28.917 --> 18:30.500
Look, I don't want to butt
into your personal life..

18:30.583 --> 18:32.208
It's a little late for that,
now, isn't?

18:32.292 --> 18:34.500
But I've checked your logs. You
pull shifts you don't have to.

18:34.583 --> 18:36.542
You've been checking up on me,
huh?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.083
I thought you were my friend.

18:38.167 --> 18:40.625
Damn it, Stephen,
I am your friend.

18:40.708 --> 18:43.750
And we wouldn't be having this
conversation if I weren't.

18:43.833 --> 18:46.167
I'm just concerned, I thought
we could talk about it.

18:46.250 --> 18:47.625
Alright, we talked about it,
okay?

18:47.708 --> 18:49.458
Stop trying to put
your problems on me.

18:49.542 --> 18:51.708
Just because you never met
a bottle you didn't like.

18:54.833 --> 18:58.000
I'm sorry,
that was out of line.

18:58.083 --> 18:59.333
Yeah.

19:00.750 --> 19:03.500
Skip it. Skip it.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.042
Food's getting cold.

19:06.333 --> 19:08.958
Look, Michael, I don't have
a problem, okay?

19:09.042 --> 19:11.583
But if it makes you happy,
I'll cut back on the stims

19:11.667 --> 19:13.500
because it's not a big deal.

19:15.250 --> 19:16.958
Okay.

19:18.458 --> 19:21.000
[instrumental music]

19:27.417 --> 19:30.917
Ah. I got your message.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.333
- Where's Na'Far?
- Sleeping.

19:36.167 --> 19:39.667
- It was a long trip from Narn.
- Hm.

19:39.750 --> 19:42.250
We will meet with Citizen G'Kar
tomorrow morning.

19:45.167 --> 19:47.958
It's good to see you again.

19:48.042 --> 19:49.417
And you.

19:49.500 --> 19:51.417
I wondered what happened to you.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.875
'Last I heard after we broke out
of that Streib ship'

19:53.958 --> 19:55.292
and got back.

19:55.375 --> 19:59.000
You'd been sent off
to some hospital on Narn.

19:59.083 --> 20:00.708
Needed time to heal.

20:02.125 --> 20:06.167
I meant to return
to thank you for saving my life.

20:08.500 --> 20:10.917
Then the war came.

20:11.000 --> 20:15.292
It was terrible. Millions dead.

20:15.375 --> 20:20.042
I tried to serve,
to help any way I could.

20:20.125 --> 20:22.542
That's how you wound up
with Na'Far?

20:22.625 --> 20:24.333
Bodyguard.

20:26.667 --> 20:30.125
Sometimes I do not know
who I'm protecting him against.

20:30.208 --> 20:33.375
Outsiders or my own people.

20:34.625 --> 20:37.458
But because of him, I am here.

20:37.542 --> 20:40.167
And now I can thank you.

20:40.250 --> 20:42.500
I owe you a debt.

20:42.583 --> 20:45.375
A debt I must repay
as a matter of honor.

20:47.375 --> 20:49.333
[laughs]
I'm not entirely sure

20:49.417 --> 20:51.458
what my superiors back home
would think if I suddenly

20:51.542 --> 20:54.667
began showing up places
with a Narn bodyguard.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.375
They would say

20:56.458 --> 21:00.792
"Here is a man
who will live to be a 150."

21:03.792 --> 21:05.583
[both laughing]

21:08.083 --> 21:09.333
[dramatic music]

21:09.417 --> 21:10.625
(David)
'Computer's finished processing'

21:10.708 --> 21:12.333
'their language codes,
commander.'

21:12.417 --> 21:13.833
Can you translate their message?

21:13.917 --> 21:16.042
(David)
I think so. Stand by.

21:18.417 --> 21:20.625
It's a recorded message,
as we thought.

21:20.708 --> 21:24.167
The probe was sent to find other
life forms and initiate contact.

21:24.250 --> 21:25.542
So far so good.

21:25.625 --> 21:26.875
What about
the rest of the message?

21:26.958 --> 21:29.625
It's a series of questions.

21:29.708 --> 21:31.292
Physics.

21:31.375 --> 21:32.833
Quantum mechanics.

21:32.917 --> 21:34.375
Molecular biology.

21:34.458 --> 21:35.833
Genetics.

21:35.917 --> 21:38.208
'Apparently, it's some form
of intelligence test'

21:38.292 --> 21:39.500
'to determine if we're'

21:39.583 --> 21:41.125
'sufficiently intelligent
for contact.'

21:41.208 --> 21:44.375
Well, gee, I'm honored.
So, what do we get if we pass?

21:44.458 --> 21:47.875
Cures for every known
form of disease.

21:47.958 --> 21:51.042
Technological information
centuries beyond our own.

21:51.125 --> 21:54.125
[sighs]
Why didn't they say so
in the first place?

21:54.208 --> 21:56.208
Congratulations, lieutenant,
I think we're about

21:56.292 --> 21:57.958
to go down
in history books.

21:58.042 --> 21:59.458
Just one thing.

21:59.542 --> 22:01.708
It says that if we don't provide
all the correct answers

22:01.792 --> 22:04.292
within 24 hours, the probe
will self-destruct

22:04.375 --> 22:08.458
with the force of
...500,000 megatons.

22:08.542 --> 22:11.167
That's enough to vaporize
the entire station.

22:11.250 --> 22:13.792
[music continues]

22:17.708 --> 22:19.250
[intense music]

22:19.333 --> 22:21.917
(Susan)
'We did a low-power scan
of the probe.'

22:22.000 --> 22:24.250
It began a countdown
to a thermonuclear reaction

22:24.333 --> 22:26.333
just after we finished
decoding the message.

22:26.417 --> 22:28.000
If it goes off within this area

22:28.083 --> 22:31.417
there won't be enough left
of Babylon 5 to fill a thimble.

22:31.500 --> 22:33.583
Can we get inside, defuse it?

22:33.667 --> 22:36.375
Negative. The hull is seamless.
We'd have to burn our way in.

22:36.458 --> 22:39.583
The message said any attempt
to defuse or destroy the probe

22:39.667 --> 22:41.417
would result in immediate
self-destruct.

22:41.500 --> 22:43.417
What about those questions
they wants us to answer?

22:43.500 --> 22:45.000
How many are we looking at?

22:45.083 --> 22:46.542
Just over 600.

22:46.625 --> 22:48.917
We've got less than 23 hours
to pull them all together.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.417
I've got the computer
working on it now

22:50.500 --> 22:52.042
but some of the stuff
is pretty theoretical.

22:52.125 --> 22:53.625
I mean, it's very advanced.

22:53.708 --> 22:56.083
I had to send back to Earth for
some of it. I don't understand.

22:56.167 --> 22:57.708
I mean, why would they
wanna destroy us..

22:57.792 --> 22:59.625
...if we can't answer
all their questions?

22:59.708 --> 23:02.208
Whoever sent this
considers intelligence

23:02.292 --> 23:04.458
the most important factor
in deciding who should live

23:04.542 --> 23:07.417
and expand out
into the universe.

23:07.500 --> 23:09.667
The probe finds
worthy candidates

23:09.750 --> 23:12.125
and eliminates those it
considers less evolved

23:12.208 --> 23:13.708
less intelligent.

23:13.792 --> 23:16.708
Sort of like
an interstellar gardener?

23:16.792 --> 23:18.750
Plucking out of the weeds
so just the flowers can grow?

23:18.833 --> 23:20.750
[laugh]
Basically, yes.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.958
Well, let's just hope
the high-IQ boys back home

23:23.042 --> 23:25.125
give us all the right answers
to this test.

23:25.208 --> 23:26.417
Otherwise we're gonna get hit

23:26.500 --> 23:29.208
with a 500,000-megaton
weed whacker.

23:29.292 --> 23:33.292
Many of our people are starving,
G'Kar.

23:33.375 --> 23:38.167
Starving because the roads
have been mined.

23:38.250 --> 23:41.292
Centauri relief ships
carrying food

23:41.375 --> 23:44.500
are shot down by the resistance
before they can land.

23:44.583 --> 23:47.958
They are trying to buy
loyalty with food.

23:48.042 --> 23:50.750
Peace with crumbs
from their table.

23:50.833 --> 23:54.333
What does it matter
where the food comes from?

23:54.417 --> 23:57.333
- It keeps our people alive.
- It matters.

23:57.417 --> 23:59.000
(Na'Far)
'Only to you!'

23:59.083 --> 24:00.875
You don't appreciate
the damage you're causing

24:00.958 --> 24:03.333
our people back home
by leading this resistance!

24:03.417 --> 24:06.042
Damage I'm..

24:06.125 --> 24:08.583
Damage I'm causing?

24:08.667 --> 24:10.667
I didn't invade Narn!

24:10.750 --> 24:13.458
I didn't bomb our world
with asteroids!

24:13.542 --> 24:15.208
Level our cities!

24:15.292 --> 24:18.958
- I didn't--
- Alright.

24:19.042 --> 24:21.292
I'm sorry, G'Kar.

24:21.375 --> 24:25.125
The choice of words
was unfortunate.

24:33.458 --> 24:37.083
Any Centauri vessel
is a legitimate target.

24:37.167 --> 24:41.208
We are arranging
for our own food drops.

24:41.292 --> 24:44.917
You cannot bring in
as much as the Centauri

24:45.000 --> 24:46.208
not enough to do any good.

24:46.292 --> 24:47.750
Neither can they.

24:47.833 --> 24:50.625
What little they bring
is a token with one purpose

24:50.708 --> 24:53.667
to make our people fight
over their scraps.

24:53.750 --> 24:57.042
You think they care
what happens to us?

24:57.125 --> 24:59.208
This is about control.

24:59.292 --> 25:01.750
I think it's about pride.

25:01.833 --> 25:03.625
Your pride.

25:03.708 --> 25:06.250
'You sit here in exile'

25:06.333 --> 25:08.750
'and dream of your return
in triumph'

25:08.833 --> 25:11.875
of personally driving
the Centauri from our world.

25:11.958 --> 25:15.083
But this is not the time
for armed resistance, G'Kar.

25:15.167 --> 25:18.792
Soon, yes, but not now.

25:18.875 --> 25:21.083
We must bide our time

25:21.167 --> 25:23.042
recover from our wounds

25:23.125 --> 25:27.542
and lull the Centauri
into a sense of false security.

25:27.625 --> 25:29.042
How?

25:30.667 --> 25:32.417
By surrendering?

25:32.500 --> 25:35.292
We are fighting for our world,
Na'Far.

25:40.833 --> 25:44.333
What would you have me do
otherwise?

25:44.417 --> 25:48.167
Postpone the fight,
just for a little while

25:48.250 --> 25:50.500
and come back with me..

25:50.583 --> 25:52.375
...to Narn.

25:52.458 --> 25:55.000
Surrender to the Centauri.

25:55.083 --> 25:58.500
I have it on very good authority
that you will not be harmed.

25:58.583 --> 26:02.458
If I return, who will lead
our people here?

26:02.542 --> 26:06.292
I will. The Centauri trust me.

26:06.375 --> 26:08.833
The others will not accept you.

26:08.917 --> 26:10.917
They may.

26:11.000 --> 26:15.083
When I tell them that if you
do not come back with me..

26:15.167 --> 26:16.667
...the Centauri will begin

26:16.750 --> 26:20.125
harassing their families
back home.

26:20.208 --> 26:24.708
Some of them
may even be imprisoned..

26:24.792 --> 26:26.875
...or tortured.

26:26.958 --> 26:30.542
'For the sake of everyone,
G'Kar..'

26:30.625 --> 26:34.833
...you must give up Babylon 5..

26:34.917 --> 26:36.208
...and come home.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.500
(Stephen)
'Does it hurt here?'

26:39.583 --> 26:42.875
Does it hurt here? Right here?
Does it hurt?

26:42.958 --> 26:44.083
How about..

26:44.167 --> 26:45.500
[sneers]

26:45.583 --> 26:47.042
It doesn't understand
a damn thing I'm saying.

26:47.125 --> 26:49.167
- Where's the translator?
- It should be here any minute.

26:49.250 --> 26:50.625
But they said that
a half-hour ago!

26:50.708 --> 26:52.042
Now, I can't do
a proper diagnosis

26:52.125 --> 26:53.333
if I can't communicate.

26:53.417 --> 26:54.750
It may have
a ruptured peratellum

26:54.833 --> 26:56.208
too small to show up
on the scanners.

26:56.292 --> 26:57.708
Now, I don't want to operate
unless..

26:57.792 --> 26:59.458
[machine beeps]

26:59.542 --> 27:01.000
Damn it!

27:01.083 --> 27:03.833
What now?

27:03.917 --> 27:05.167
Yes?

27:05.250 --> 27:06.667
I was wondering
if you heard from Earth

27:06.750 --> 27:08.500
on those medical questions.

27:08.583 --> 27:10.708
No, I'm sorry, I..

27:10.792 --> 27:12.167
[sighs]
I haven't been able
to check back.

27:12.250 --> 27:13.833
I've been a little busy
around here.

27:13.917 --> 27:16.375
Doctor, if we don't get those
answers on molecular biology

27:16.458 --> 27:17.917
whatever you're doing
down there won't matter

27:18.000 --> 27:19.375
because your patients
won't live long enough

27:19.458 --> 27:20.917
to appreciate your assistance.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.208
Alright, alright. Alright, I'll
check back as soon as I can.

27:24.292 --> 27:26.542
Alright? Medlab out.

27:26.625 --> 27:27.708
[groaning]

27:27.792 --> 27:29.042
Look, we can't wait much longer.

27:29.125 --> 27:31.250
Prep him for surgery,
we'll do an exploratory.

27:31.333 --> 27:33.500
Yes, doctor. Come on.

27:36.292 --> 27:38.792
[intense music]

27:48.625 --> 27:50.208
I don't want to go to Minbar.

27:50.292 --> 27:52.833
(Londo)
'Oh, of course,
you want to go to Minbar.'

27:52.917 --> 27:55.042
Everyone wants to go to Minbar.

27:55.125 --> 27:58.000
It is the vacation spot
of the season

27:58.083 --> 28:01.917
assuming you're part of the
long-robes-and-head-bone set.

28:02.000 --> 28:04.208
- Londo
- 'Vir.'

28:04.292 --> 28:06.083
It's a good career move for you.

28:06.167 --> 28:10.250
From time to time you'll
come back here, report to me.

28:10.333 --> 28:13.417
We will, uh,
do a little business together.

28:13.500 --> 28:15.917
And who will take care of things
when I'm gone?

28:16.000 --> 28:19.875
I am quite capable
of taking care of myself, Vir.

28:19.958 --> 28:23.875
I want you away from here.
It is not a good place for you.

28:23.958 --> 28:27.500
- I want to protect you.
- I don't want to be protected!

28:27.583 --> 28:30.917
Well, I'm afraid it's not your
decision. It's already done.

28:31.042 --> 28:32.417
You have been promoted.

28:32.500 --> 28:35.083
You will earn more money,
receive more attention

28:35.167 --> 28:39.250
women may even come to find you
attractive...in time.

28:39.333 --> 28:40.708
I know it is a great burden

28:40.792 --> 28:43.333
but I think that
you will adjust.

28:43.417 --> 28:46.792
Now, I must go.
I'm late for my appointment.

28:46.875 --> 28:50.250
Londo, if I leave,
you will be alone.

28:50.333 --> 28:53.250
Ah, I have always been alone.

28:56.708 --> 28:58.125
[whispering]

28:58.208 --> 29:00.458
(male #3)
'And what do we make of this?'

29:00.542 --> 29:01.958
It looks Narn on the outside

29:02.042 --> 29:05.750
but I hear it is Centauri
on the inside.

29:05.833 --> 29:08.875
I don't know
what you're talking about.

29:08.958 --> 29:10.167
I am a duly appointed liaison--

29:10.250 --> 29:13.375
Appointed by who? The Centauri?

29:13.458 --> 29:17.625
To be their pet,
their messenger, their puppet?

29:18.750 --> 29:20.458
I just heard from Homeworld.

29:20.542 --> 29:22.833
My pouch-brother
has been arrested.

29:22.917 --> 29:26.208
I'm told he will be released
when G'Kar returns home.

29:26.292 --> 29:29.375
I'm sorry. I tried to warn you.

29:29.458 --> 29:33.333
You are a blood traitor, Na'Far.

29:33.417 --> 29:35.875
The Centauri failed
to break us with bombs

29:35.958 --> 29:38.125
and guns and ships.

29:38.208 --> 29:42.875
And now you come
to break our soul.

29:42.958 --> 29:45.458
Go back to Narn.
Or we'll..

29:47.000 --> 29:49.958
You would strike against
your own kind?

29:50.042 --> 29:52.833
Only if you consider
someone cowardly enough

29:52.917 --> 29:55.917
to strike from behind
one of his own kind.

29:58.333 --> 30:00.750
Stop it! Enough!

30:03.375 --> 30:05.708
Have I led you
no better than this?

30:08.083 --> 30:10.875
Have I taught you
no better than this?

30:10.958 --> 30:12.417
Look at yourselves.

30:12.500 --> 30:14.625
We're at each other's throats!

30:16.375 --> 30:19.667
By G'Quan, I won't have this.

30:19.750 --> 30:21.292
Na'Far.

30:23.333 --> 30:25.167
I won't allow the Centauri
to use me

30:25.250 --> 30:28.417
to turn us against one another.

30:28.500 --> 30:32.292
If they want me to return home,
if that is the price..

30:32.375 --> 30:34.875
...then let's pay it
and get this over with.

30:37.042 --> 30:39.625
I will return with you to Narn.

30:44.125 --> 30:47.167
[intense music]

30:51.000 --> 30:53.500
[intense music]

30:54.750 --> 30:56.292
How're we doing
on those questions?

30:56.375 --> 30:58.417
Seventy-five more to go,
we just started translating

30:58.500 --> 30:59.792
the batch on molecular biology.

30:59.875 --> 31:01.250
Corwin check these figures again

31:01.333 --> 31:03.500
make sure they came through
the translator okay.

31:03.583 --> 31:05.042
I don't want to get killed
because of a typo.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.750
- It will be embarrassing.
- On it.

31:06.833 --> 31:08.250
Can we power up
the weapons system gradually

31:08.333 --> 31:09.750
so the probe won't pick it up?

31:09.833 --> 31:11.750
We can try but it may not
matter, the probe's supposed to

31:11.833 --> 31:13.417
be fast enough to blow
the instant we fire.

31:13.500 --> 31:16.583
Yeah, maybe.
And maybe they're bluffing.

31:16.667 --> 31:18.167
If we don't get
those answers in time

31:18.250 --> 31:20.500
we may have to take that chance.
Power up slowly.

31:20.583 --> 31:22.792
Captain, I've got
the Transport Pilots Association

31:22.875 --> 31:24.542
on the link again.

31:24.625 --> 31:26.042
'They want to know when
you're gonna meet with them'

31:26.125 --> 31:27.792
'to finish the discussion
about weapons.'

31:27.875 --> 31:29.958
They've called five times
in the last hour.

31:30.042 --> 31:31.208
How long before
that probe detonates?

31:31.292 --> 31:32.542
Six hours.

31:32.625 --> 31:34.292
Tell them we'll reconvene
in seven hours.

31:34.375 --> 31:36.083
If that thing blows,
at least it'll save me

31:36.167 --> 31:38.042
from one more annoying
conversation.

31:38.125 --> 31:40.500
Always finding the good
in every situation, eh, captain?

31:40.583 --> 31:43.417
Absolutely. If I didn't,
I might end up like you.

31:45.375 --> 31:47.417
Hey!
What's that supposed to mean?

31:47.500 --> 31:49.792
Did anybody else hear that?
Did you hear that?

31:49.875 --> 31:51.875
- No, commander.
- Good.

31:51.958 --> 31:53.792
I swear, if we live through this
somebody's gonna find their

31:53.875 --> 31:55.500
automatic shower
preferences reprogrammed

31:55.583 --> 31:57.333
for ice water.

32:01.083 --> 32:02.625
Yes?

32:05.500 --> 32:07.167
'Mr. Garibaldi.'

32:07.250 --> 32:08.917
It's late.
What can I do for you?

32:09.000 --> 32:12.333
I heard on the grapevine
you were, uh, leaving.

32:12.417 --> 32:15.167
I didn't believe it, but figured
I better check it out.

32:15.250 --> 32:17.667
The families of those
here on Babylon 5

32:17.750 --> 32:21.542
will be harassed and intimidated
until I return.

32:21.625 --> 32:23.583
So, I return.

32:25.083 --> 32:28.208
I thought your government
gave you orders to stay.

32:28.292 --> 32:30.833
That government
no longer exists.

32:30.917 --> 32:33.500
I do what I must.

32:33.583 --> 32:38.000
If you go back,
the Centauri will kill you.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.958
You know it, I know it.

32:41.292 --> 32:45.208
If I didn't know better
I might think you were..

32:45.292 --> 32:47.125
...genuinely concerned.

32:48.375 --> 32:52.667
G'Kar, too many people
in my life have died.

32:52.750 --> 32:56.500
And I don't want to add
any more to the list.

32:56.583 --> 33:00.083
So, please, don't do it.

33:00.167 --> 33:02.583
My fate
is in the hands of G'Quan.

33:04.292 --> 33:06.542
What must happen will happen.

33:08.250 --> 33:11.167
Thank you for your concern..

33:11.250 --> 33:12.958
...Mr. Garibaldi.

33:15.167 --> 33:16.417
Goodnight.

33:23.292 --> 33:25.292
[door closes]

33:29.000 --> 33:30.375
And we've been able
to track down

33:30.458 --> 33:32.125
most of the data you asked for.

33:32.208 --> 33:33.333
I'm transmitting it now.

33:33.417 --> 33:34.875
Wait, wait, wait.
Wait a minute.

33:34.958 --> 33:36.917
Now, what do you mean,
most of the data?

33:37.000 --> 33:39.250
Two of the questions
in molecular biology

33:39.333 --> 33:41.167
are very advanced.

33:41.250 --> 33:42.750
'There have only been
a couple of papers'

33:42.833 --> 33:44.250
'published in this area.'

33:44.333 --> 33:46.042
Both by Dr. Franz Mueller.

33:46.125 --> 33:47.958
We haven't been able
to get ahold of him.

33:48.042 --> 33:49.667
But you've got
the rest of the data.

33:49.750 --> 33:52.542
No, no, the rest don't matter
unless you have all of them.

33:52.625 --> 33:55.500
You can't just give me some
of them and say it's enough!

33:55.583 --> 33:57.625
Dr. Mueller is on vacation.

33:57.708 --> 34:00.125
Well, then, you'd better damn
well find him!

34:00.208 --> 34:01.750
Or you're gonna have a
quarter-million dead people

34:01.833 --> 34:03.208
on your conscience!

34:03.292 --> 34:05.208
There's no reason to speak
to me in that fashion.

34:05.292 --> 34:06.458
Oh, God.

34:06.542 --> 34:07.875
You know, we've got
four hours to live

34:07.958 --> 34:09.458
and you're worried
about being rude?

34:09.542 --> 34:10.667
'No, no, no,
I don't want to hear it.'

34:10.750 --> 34:12.042
Now you get on that web

34:12.125 --> 34:13.792
you use his emergency code
and you find him!

34:13.875 --> 34:15.958
'Or I swear, the last thing
I'll do is send a report'

34:16.042 --> 34:17.833
'on your incompetence
straight to Earth Dome!'

34:17.917 --> 34:19.417
You'll be disbarred so fast

34:19.500 --> 34:21.458
you'll leave skid marks as they
throw your ass out of the EMA!

34:21.542 --> 34:24.167
Now you get on it,
and you get on it now!

34:24.250 --> 34:26.333
Dr. Franklin.

34:26.417 --> 34:29.750
- Are you alright?
- Yeah.

34:29.833 --> 34:32.000
Fine.

34:32.083 --> 34:34.458
- How's the patient?
- Not good.

34:34.542 --> 34:35.917
Alright, you get him
down to Medlab 2.

34:36.000 --> 34:38.292
You get Estevez going on him
now. Go.

34:41.250 --> 34:43.792
[intense music]

34:47.875 --> 34:49.708
[syringe hisses]

34:52.792 --> 34:54.458
[exhales]

34:54.542 --> 34:57.833
Citizen G'Kar has said
the things you want to hear.

34:57.917 --> 35:02.625
Focused your anger on blood
and revenge and retaliation.

35:02.708 --> 35:05.042
All these things will be ours..

35:05.125 --> 35:09.042
...but at the proper time
and in the proper way.

35:09.125 --> 35:11.458
This is neither.

35:11.542 --> 35:13.417
'As the newly established
liaison'

35:13.500 --> 35:16.375
between you and
the provisional government.

35:16.458 --> 35:21.250
I can help you work within
the system imposed upon us..

35:21.333 --> 35:23.417
...to rebuild Narn.

35:23.500 --> 35:28.667
'To feed, clothe
and protect our people.'

35:28.750 --> 35:31.708
For what can be
more important..

35:31.792 --> 35:33.458
...than their safety?

35:33.542 --> 35:36.417
There is, perhaps, one thing.

35:38.667 --> 35:40.792
- 'How much time?'
- 'Three minutes.'

35:40.875 --> 35:43.250
- Standing by to transmit.
- Commander.

35:43.333 --> 35:45.125
The message we got
from the probe.

35:45.208 --> 35:47.500
What did it promise, if we did
give all the right answers?

35:47.583 --> 35:50.500
Advanced tech, mainly, medical
information, cures for disease

35:50.583 --> 35:52.125
new jumpgate technology.

35:52.208 --> 35:54.750
But it never gave you the name
of the race or where it's from?

35:54.833 --> 35:57.417
I assume we get that information
once we pass the test.

35:57.500 --> 35:58.958
Two minutes.

35:59.042 --> 36:00.958
- Okay, here we go.
- No, wait!

36:02.458 --> 36:04.542
There's something about this
that has been bothering me

36:04.625 --> 36:06.625
ever since we made contact.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.625
We have been operating under
the assumption that

36:08.708 --> 36:11.083
whoever sent the probe..

36:11.167 --> 36:12.417
...is deciding whether or not

36:12.500 --> 36:14.250
a sentient race
is fit to survive

36:14.333 --> 36:17.583
based on what they know
at the moment of contact.

36:17.667 --> 36:19.417
But if that's true,
why give them a leg up

36:19.500 --> 36:21.375
on more advanced technologies?

36:21.458 --> 36:22.792
Maybe they're feeling generous.

36:22.875 --> 36:24.167
No, if they were
feeling generous

36:24.250 --> 36:26.083
they wouldn't be wiping out
inferior races

36:26.167 --> 36:29.125
based on lack of advancement.

36:29.208 --> 36:30.333
Now, I don't like it.

36:30.417 --> 36:31.542
Captain, we're down
to one minute.

36:31.625 --> 36:33.792
I don't see
any other options here.

36:33.875 --> 36:35.458
What if it's a berserker?

36:35.542 --> 36:38.083
A probe sent out to find
life forms advanced enough

36:38.167 --> 36:40.542
to pose a threat
to the race that created it?

36:40.625 --> 36:43.667
It sends a list of questions
backed by a threat.

36:43.750 --> 36:46.000
If it gets the right answers
back that proves

36:46.083 --> 36:49.125
a certain level of technological
advancement, then boom!

36:49.208 --> 36:50.625
You wipe out a potential enemy

36:50.708 --> 36:52.708
without leaving any trace
of where you came from.

36:52.792 --> 36:55.458
Or it could be exactly
what it said.

36:55.542 --> 36:58.458
Fifteen seconds.
Captain, send or no send?

37:01.667 --> 37:03.833
No send.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.083
Oh, boy.

37:05.167 --> 37:07.708
[intense music]

37:12.208 --> 37:13.792
It's breaking off,
you're right.

37:13.875 --> 37:16.417
Yeah, well, being right isn't
enough. What about the next guy?

37:16.500 --> 37:18.458
Are there any secure-bots
in that area?

37:18.542 --> 37:20.542
Just one, 5000 klicks.

37:21.708 --> 37:23.458
It's far enough.

37:23.542 --> 37:25.958
Relay those answers to the bot
move it toward the probe

37:26.042 --> 37:27.792
and have it stand by
to transmit.

37:27.875 --> 37:30.417
[music continues]

37:36.083 --> 37:38.708
(David)
'Probe is at 3000 klicks.'

37:38.792 --> 37:41.000
Three thousand four.

37:41.083 --> 37:43.583
- 'Three thousand six.'
- Stand by.

37:46.167 --> 37:47.792
Stand by.

37:50.333 --> 37:51.583
Transmit.

37:59.583 --> 38:02.125
[explosion]

38:08.583 --> 38:11.833
Send out a recovery team
to pick up the debris for study.

38:11.917 --> 38:14.000
Captain, you alright?

38:14.083 --> 38:15.375
Oh, nuts.

38:15.458 --> 38:17.042
(Susan)
What's wrong?

38:17.125 --> 38:18.583
I mean, we survived.

38:18.667 --> 38:19.708
Right.

38:19.792 --> 38:21.042
Which means now
I have to go back to that

38:21.125 --> 38:24.792
stupid transport
association meeting.

38:24.875 --> 38:26.583
Oh, well.

38:29.792 --> 38:31.833
If I live through this job..

38:31.917 --> 38:33.667
...without completely losing
my mind..

38:33.750 --> 38:36.208
...it will be a miracle
of biblical proportions.

38:36.292 --> 38:39.583
Well, there goes my faith
in the Almighty.

38:41.583 --> 38:43.125
[clears throat]

38:56.750 --> 38:59.083
Is there a problem, G'Dok?

38:59.167 --> 39:01.333
I cannot let you leave.

39:01.417 --> 39:04.458
You are valued.
And you are needed here.

39:05.833 --> 39:08.458
Thank you, but I must go.

39:11.833 --> 39:14.667
I'm sorry, but I do what I must.

39:19.208 --> 39:21.625
We cannot let you leave, G'Kar.

39:21.708 --> 39:25.250
You are valued
and you are needed here.

39:25.333 --> 39:27.458
This is foolishness.

39:27.542 --> 39:29.958
I'm doing this
for your own good.

39:34.875 --> 39:37.500
We cannot let you go, G'Kar.

39:37.583 --> 39:41.083
The only way out
is through all of us.

39:41.167 --> 39:43.250
If I stay here

39:43.333 --> 39:45.667
your families
are in jeopardy.

39:47.042 --> 39:50.125
Is anything more important
than their safety?

39:50.208 --> 39:52.958
Yes. Their freedom.

39:53.042 --> 39:55.125
It's better to die
in the cause of freedom

39:55.208 --> 39:58.000
than to live in comfort
as a slave.

39:58.083 --> 40:01.125
We understand this and
our families understand this

40:01.208 --> 40:03.458
because you taught it to us.

40:04.917 --> 40:07.583
Stay, G'Kar, for us

40:07.667 --> 40:09.125
and for them.

40:09.208 --> 40:11.042
To leave now that I have decided

40:11.125 --> 40:13.958
to stay and join
the others would be rude.

40:17.417 --> 40:19.417
And extremely uncomfortable.

40:21.917 --> 40:23.708
That is a K'tok.

40:25.958 --> 40:31.000
Once drawn, it cannot be
sheathed until it draws blood.

40:31.083 --> 40:35.750
Again, you would raise arms
against your own kind.

40:35.833 --> 40:38.292
Have I taught you nothing?

40:38.375 --> 40:42.125
I carry my sword in my hand.

40:42.208 --> 40:46.250
You carry yours in your heart
and in your mind.

40:46.333 --> 40:48.167
As I see it

40:48.250 --> 40:51.375
that gives you a 2-to-1
advantage in arms.

40:51.458 --> 40:53.667
Be fair, Citizen G'Kar.

40:56.833 --> 40:58.125
[chuckles]

41:00.750 --> 41:02.000
I will stay.

41:02.083 --> 41:05.208
[all cheering]

41:09.625 --> 41:10.875
Thank you.

41:12.750 --> 41:15.292
[intense music]

41:29.417 --> 41:31.583
We never get a break, do we?

41:31.667 --> 41:33.167
Now, we went through
that whole nonsense

41:33.250 --> 41:35.750
because some race
wants to yank our chain.

41:35.833 --> 41:38.125
Pass the test and die.

41:38.208 --> 41:40.208
Fail the test
and remain ignorant.

41:40.292 --> 41:42.125
I know, it's a pain in the neck.

41:42.208 --> 41:45.542
But would you really want your
life safe, predictable, easy?

41:47.458 --> 41:48.875
Sometimes.

41:50.500 --> 41:52.292
Listen, uh..

41:52.375 --> 41:54.958
I wanna say, I may have jumped
the gun a little when we talked.

41:55.042 --> 41:57.250
I had no business getting in
your face about the stims.

41:57.333 --> 41:59.750
You say you got it covered,
that's your call.

42:01.250 --> 42:02.583
Thank you.

42:02.667 --> 42:05.417
And I do have it covered.
I do.

42:05.500 --> 42:07.542
I mean, I went through this
whole nonsense with the probe

42:07.625 --> 42:09.958
and, and about a half
a dozen sick patients

42:10.042 --> 42:12.292
and I-I never touched
the stuff once.

42:14.708 --> 42:18.000
So where's the captain
and Ivanova?

42:18.083 --> 42:19.833
Heroes of the hour, huh?

42:19.917 --> 42:21.292
Don't ask.

42:22.833 --> 42:25.125
Order. People, please!

42:25.208 --> 42:27.542
I can't conduct this meeting.

42:27.625 --> 42:28.958
Please.

42:29.042 --> 42:30.958
[people clamoring]

42:31.042 --> 42:32.375
Stop.

42:33.958 --> 42:35.208
Order!

42:36.750 --> 42:40.125
(man on PA)
'Final boarding call
for Minbari liner Zoful'

42:40.208 --> 42:43.292
'now departing
from Bay 7 to Minbar..'

42:43.375 --> 42:45.750
[instrumental music]

42:45.833 --> 42:48.417
[indistinct chatter on PA]

42:52.500 --> 42:55.375
'All passengers requiring
loading assistance..'

43:05.458 --> 43:06.917
[theme music]
