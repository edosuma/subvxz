WEBVTT

00:30.834 --> 00:34.125
Honestly, Z, was there a party
where you didn't drop trou?

00:34.208 --> 00:37.417
Question is why?
It's Elfin.

00:37.500 --> 00:38.834
Can't even see it.

00:38.917 --> 00:39.834
Exactly.

00:44.834 --> 00:47.000
Bobby Kennedy,
eat your heart out.

00:52.125 --> 00:53.792
Oh God, no.

00:53.875 --> 00:56.500
I'll pay you $100 to destroy
that. I'm not kidding.

00:56.583 --> 00:57.625
Unh-unh.

01:00.542 --> 01:02.750
'Ow! Looking sexy, sweetie.'

01:02.834 --> 01:04.333
Just what
the doctor likes.

01:04.417 --> 01:07.208
Uh...sweetie, that's Sara.

01:07.291 --> 01:08.667
Oops.

01:08.750 --> 01:10.750
- 'Really?'
- Yeah.

01:10.834 --> 01:13.000
We looked alike
once upon a time.

01:13.083 --> 01:16.166
We still do.
You're just prettier.

01:16.250 --> 01:18.458
First six months I knew these
two, thought they were
sisters.

01:18.542 --> 01:21.417
That's 'cause you were on acid
your entire freshman year.

01:21.500 --> 01:24.709
Come on, guys,
Z wasn't always on acid.

01:24.792 --> 01:27.959
Yeah. I switched to mushrooms
sophomore year.

01:28.041 --> 01:30.250
How much longer you
gonna torture us, Jack?

01:30.333 --> 01:32.500
Oh, I love these pictures.

01:32.583 --> 01:34.625
'Reminds me of the freedom
of our college days.'

01:34.709 --> 01:35.875
'How we all met.'

01:35.959 --> 01:38.625
- I'd go back in a
heartbeat.
- Yeah?

01:38.709 --> 01:41.500
Mm-hmm. Back then,
I had so much time.

01:41.583 --> 01:43.709
Spent it with you guys.
And now--

01:43.792 --> 01:44.875
(Jack)
'Work people.'

01:44.959 --> 01:46.667
Bills people.
Commute people.

01:46.750 --> 01:48.291
Voted-for-Reagan people.

01:48.375 --> 01:50.250
- Hey.
- Yeah.

01:55.166 --> 01:56.250
McBride.

01:57.792 --> 01:59.000
(Jack)
'Sorry.'

01:59.083 --> 02:01.834
I-I don't know how
that one got in there.

02:08.375 --> 02:11.125
I guess the show is over.

02:51.333 --> 02:53.583
Johanna? Everything alright?

03:28.333 --> 03:30.250
- Morning, boss.
- Morning.

03:30.333 --> 03:33.166
- Louie.
- Hey, Rush. Long time.

03:34.083 --> 03:36.709
Looking good.

03:36.792 --> 03:38.542
Back at ya, Louie.

03:38.625 --> 03:40.500
Couple named
Jack and Johanna Kimball

03:40.583 --> 03:43.125
died here in 1981.

03:43.208 --> 03:46.166
It looked like an
accidental gas leak explosion.

03:46.250 --> 03:48.166
(Louie)
Yeah, "looked" being
the operative word.

03:48.250 --> 03:49.458
(Stillman)
The blast from the stove

03:49.542 --> 03:52.458
ripped through a portion
of the kitchen floor.

03:52.542 --> 03:55.291
Debris fell behind
the basement drywall.

03:55.375 --> 03:56.792
Did the owner
find something?

03:56.875 --> 03:58.083
(Stillman)
'A construction foreman did'

03:58.166 --> 03:59.291
'while doing renovations.'

04:00.792 --> 04:03.208
Fragments of a pipe cap.

04:04.208 --> 04:06.250
And melted battery.

04:06.333 --> 04:07.583
Talking bomb?

04:07.667 --> 04:09.041
'A bomb specifically designed'

04:09.125 --> 04:10.917
to mimic a gas explosion.

04:11.041 --> 04:12.959
That's why they didn't
find anything back in '81?

04:13.041 --> 04:16.625
Yep. Can't find what you're
not looking for, right?

04:16.709 --> 04:18.917
A battery was used for
a triggering device?

04:19.000 --> 04:20.000
Bingo.

04:20.083 --> 04:21.917
What kind of couple
were these two?

04:22.000 --> 04:23.542
Clean-cut.
Upwardly mobile.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.000
And blown to bits.

05:04.333 --> 05:05.709
One-page report.

05:05.792 --> 05:07.375
Bodies blasted to smithereens.

05:07.458 --> 05:10.208
Nothing we don't know.

05:10.291 --> 05:14.166
The Kimball's met at Penn,
got married in 1973.

05:14.250 --> 05:15.875
Jack was
an ad
copywriter.

05:15.959 --> 05:17.542
Johanna was
a corporate
lawyer.

05:17.625 --> 05:19.250
No kids.

05:19.333 --> 05:20.875
All work and no play.

05:20.959 --> 05:22.208
Young couple
making a lot of money

05:22.291 --> 05:23.375
settled into the Main Line.

05:23.458 --> 05:26.208
1981.
First wave of yuppies.

05:26.291 --> 05:29.375
College friend named Sara
Lowell
paid for their funerals.

05:29.458 --> 05:31.709
Lil and Scotty
are starting there.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.500
Excuse me.

05:37.208 --> 05:39.417
- Hey, Janie.
- Hey, dad.

05:40.542 --> 05:42.166
Hey, Sean, how ya doing?

05:42.250 --> 05:44.166
- Okay.
- What do you got there?

05:44.250 --> 05:45.375
Avatar Aang.

05:45.458 --> 05:46.875
He can bend air.

05:46.959 --> 05:48.333
Is that right?

05:48.417 --> 05:50.500
[chuckles]
Go wait in grandpa's
office, sweetie.

05:50.583 --> 05:52.333
I'll be right there.

05:56.667 --> 06:00.458
- You okay, Janie?
- Yeah. No.

06:00.542 --> 06:02.583
I was wondering if you could
take Sean for a couple of
days.

06:02.667 --> 06:04.250
Mom's in Florida.

06:04.333 --> 06:05.500
Oh sure, sure.

06:05.583 --> 06:08.208
Carl and I need
a night together to talk.

06:08.291 --> 06:09.208
Something happen?

06:09.291 --> 06:11.333
No. We've just become strangers

06:11.417 --> 06:12.583
who live in the same house.

06:15.041 --> 06:17.792
Janie, I know I'm the last
person to give advice on
this.

06:19.333 --> 06:21.458
Good, bad, whatever it is

06:21.542 --> 06:24.417
don't leave
anything left unsaid.

06:24.500 --> 06:26.041
I won't.

06:27.542 --> 06:29.000
You sure you can handle Sean?

06:30.458 --> 06:31.834
I could handle you, right?

06:54.208 --> 06:56.333
(Rush)
'These flowers
are beautiful, Sara.'

06:56.417 --> 06:59.291
'What are they?'

06:59.375 --> 07:01.333
Cattleya orchids.

07:01.417 --> 07:03.041
Rely on other shoots to bloom.

07:03.125 --> 07:05.959
My mom always said
they symbolized

07:06.041 --> 07:07.834
the strength of family.

07:07.917 --> 07:09.125
- Pretty.
- Thank you.

07:09.208 --> 07:10.500
Any thoughts on who'd wanna

07:10.583 --> 07:11.667
hurt Jack or Johanna?

07:11.750 --> 07:12.959
None.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.834
They were a young,
happy couple, no
enemies.

07:15.917 --> 07:17.667
So when'd you last see 'em?

07:17.750 --> 07:20.417
They hosted a..
a college reunion
weekend.

07:20.500 --> 07:22.917
We left on Saturday.

07:23.000 --> 07:25.417
Next night they were dead.

07:25.500 --> 07:26.625
(Rush)
'Reunion?'

07:26.709 --> 07:27.542
Fun times?

07:27.625 --> 07:29.166
Oh, there was lots of partying

07:29.250 --> 07:30.333
and talking into the night.

07:30.417 --> 07:31.625
Like the old days.

07:31.709 --> 07:33.875
Yeah, but you didn't have
such a wonderful time?

07:35.250 --> 07:38.709
I was...still kind of stuck
in my old hippie ways.

07:38.792 --> 07:41.834
Didn't fit very well
into the decade of greed.

07:41.917 --> 07:44.000
Jack and Johanna,
they hippies, too?

07:44.083 --> 07:45.375
I mean, back in the day?

07:45.458 --> 07:46.583
No, I was the hippie.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.875
They were the true activists.

07:48.959 --> 07:50.667
The height of the Vietnam War.

07:50.750 --> 07:53.333
They were protesting against
an America that had become

07:53.417 --> 07:55.500
an imperialistic bully.

07:55.583 --> 07:56.875
Sounds vaguely familiar.

07:56.959 --> 08:00.333
Capitalism was a dirty
word
for us in '71.

08:00.417 --> 08:01.625
And in '81?

08:01.709 --> 08:03.125
Only for some of us.

08:03.208 --> 08:04.667
Not so dirty anymore.

08:12.792 --> 08:14.458
300 watts a channel.

08:14.542 --> 08:17.000
Nice. How much?

08:17.083 --> 08:18.709
I try not to dwell on that.

08:18.792 --> 08:20.375
Why? Don't feel guilty.
You earned it.

08:20.458 --> 08:23.291
By writing
candy bar
slogans.

08:23.375 --> 08:25.792
Remember when we wanted our
talents to serve a purpose?

08:25.875 --> 08:27.667
Purpose is for Cub Scouts.

08:30.375 --> 08:31.750
Hey, I just turned that down.

08:31.834 --> 08:33.250
It's still too loud.

08:33.333 --> 08:34.250
Neighbors?

08:34.333 --> 08:35.917
It's Friday night.

08:36.000 --> 08:37.041
You're not ready for bed.

08:37.125 --> 08:38.250
I didn't say that.

08:38.333 --> 08:39.959
Refill?

08:40.041 --> 08:42.250
At your service.

08:42.333 --> 08:43.917
Sara? You want something?

08:44.000 --> 08:46.417
I think I'll join you.

08:52.333 --> 08:54.166
Remember that
summer freshman year?

08:55.750 --> 08:58.458
You visited me
and my parents were gone.

09:01.041 --> 09:03.542
Feels like yesterday.

09:03.625 --> 09:04.959
Yesterday being 12 years ago.

09:05.041 --> 09:08.959
I know, I know I think
about those days too much.

09:13.458 --> 09:15.333
What are you doing?

09:15.417 --> 09:18.667
Fixing your hair. Relax.

09:18.750 --> 09:21.458
Well, fix it in front
of Jack next time.

09:21.542 --> 09:23.875
Alright, don't
put on airs with
me.

09:23.959 --> 09:25.000
Excuse me?

09:25.083 --> 09:26.125
You're a long way from that

09:26.208 --> 09:28.583
one-bedroom apartment in Newark.

09:30.417 --> 09:31.792
Grow up, Porter.

09:31.875 --> 09:33.917
Stop acting like you just
stepped off the Mayflower.

09:34.000 --> 09:35.709
Your dad was a plumber.

09:35.792 --> 09:37.208
You know, isn't it ironic

09:37.291 --> 09:41.166
that you work for
a military contractor?

09:41.250 --> 09:42.917
What's that supposed to mean?

09:43.000 --> 09:44.083
I wonder what your
boss would say

09:44.166 --> 09:45.750
if he knew
what you did in college.

09:47.083 --> 09:48.583
I take it back.
You haven't changed a
bit.

09:48.667 --> 09:51.208
You're still
a manipulative
bitch.

09:52.709 --> 09:54.125
I drive by your office
all the time.

09:54.208 --> 09:56.792
Maybe I'll stop in
and say hi.

09:56.875 --> 09:58.834
You ever go
near my workplace

09:58.917 --> 10:00.667
it'll be the
last thing you
do.

10:15.959 --> 10:17.667
What was Johanna talking about?

10:17.750 --> 10:19.083
I'm not sure.

10:19.166 --> 10:21.750
It was-it was very complicated
between those two.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.000
Complicated how?

10:23.083 --> 10:24.583
Well, they used to date before.

10:24.667 --> 10:27.542
Johanna broke it off for Jack.

10:27.625 --> 10:30.166
I don't think Porter
ever got over her.

10:30.250 --> 10:31.667
He show up at the funeral?

10:31.750 --> 10:34.208
I paid for it,
but I didn't go.

10:34.291 --> 10:36.875
I wanted to remember
Jack and Johanna as they were.

10:38.291 --> 10:40.792
I never saw any of them again
after that weekend.

10:44.417 --> 10:47.083
First Johanna dumps you
and disses you.

10:47.166 --> 10:49.333
Pissed you off pretty bad.

10:49.417 --> 10:50.834
(Jeffries)
'She had some dirt on you.'

10:50.917 --> 10:52.250
Maybe you stopped
her from talking.

10:52.333 --> 10:54.417
I'd never hurt Johanna, never.

10:54.500 --> 10:57.458
Funny. You're still not
telling us what she had on
you.

10:58.166 --> 10:59.917
Fine.

11:00.000 --> 11:01.375
We were caught
by campus security

11:01.458 --> 11:02.709
one drunken night
our freshman year.

11:02.792 --> 11:03.875
For doing what?

11:03.959 --> 11:05.875
Breaking into Penn's
ROTC headquarters

11:05.959 --> 11:07.834
and smashing it up
with a baseball bat.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.333
Ten years later
you're working
for

11:09.417 --> 11:12.458
a company with
huge military
contracts.

11:12.542 --> 11:15.959
Let me guess, this little ROTC
incident wasn't on your resume?

11:16.041 --> 11:17.250
What do you think, Einstein?

11:17.333 --> 11:19.542
I think you should
answer "yes" or
"no."

11:20.625 --> 11:22.792
That all she had on you?

11:22.875 --> 11:24.542
Yes.

11:24.625 --> 11:26.000
Why do I know you're lying?

11:26.083 --> 11:29.417
Porter...you're a suspect
in a double homicide.

11:29.500 --> 11:31.166
We'll dig deep
into your
background

11:31.250 --> 11:32.792
leave no stone unturned.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.750
We're much more
sympathetic to
suspects

11:34.834 --> 11:36.417
that do the digging for us.

11:37.667 --> 11:40.083
Look, we were
wanna-be Che Guevaras.

11:40.166 --> 11:41.291
Out to change the world.

11:41.375 --> 11:42.250
So?

11:42.333 --> 11:44.291
It's not what
Johanna had on me.

11:44.375 --> 11:45.667
It's what Z
had on all of us.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.834
Hide the children!

11:57.917 --> 12:01.000
(Porter)
'You're gonna wash
that seat off right, Z?'

12:03.125 --> 12:05.041
It ain't any bigger
in real life, pal.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.417
Enough, Z.

12:12.500 --> 12:14.417
I got neighbors.

12:15.875 --> 12:18.458
Now we care about what
the neighbors think, Jack?

12:18.542 --> 12:20.792
Yeah. Yeah, 'cause
I'm the schmuck

12:20.875 --> 12:24.041
'with a nude houseguest
riding a bike.'

12:36.667 --> 12:37.667
Knock it off, Z.

12:45.750 --> 12:47.667
You wanna say something to me?

12:49.250 --> 12:51.417
Used to be my hero, Jack.

12:53.583 --> 12:56.083
Your words inspired me.

12:56.166 --> 12:58.041
All of us.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.250
What about the plans
we had, man?

13:01.750 --> 13:04.583
Was it ever about
the 'cause, Jack?

13:04.667 --> 13:06.250
Or was it just about

13:06.333 --> 13:09.291
you hearing yourself talk?

13:09.375 --> 13:10.875
Go to hell.

13:13.083 --> 13:15.000
I'll see you there..

13:15.959 --> 13:18.000
...Mr. Jones.

13:32.834 --> 13:35.041
- Mr. Jones?
- Jones Family.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.709
Radical underground
student group

13:36.792 --> 13:38.208
in the '70s.

13:38.291 --> 13:39.917
Espoused violence for a change.

13:40.000 --> 13:42.083
I heard of them
when I was on patrol.

13:42.166 --> 13:43.208
Like the Weathermen.

13:43.291 --> 13:45.000
Used to plant bombs
in public places

13:45.083 --> 13:47.375
to protest the Vietnam War.

13:47.458 --> 13:49.041
Violence to end wars.
Makes sense.

13:49.125 --> 13:50.375
Jack was a member?

13:50.458 --> 13:51.542
We all kind of were.

13:51.625 --> 13:53.834
Went to a few meetings, but..

13:53.917 --> 13:55.583
...I thought they were all nuts.

13:55.667 --> 13:58.583
Bombing for peace,
was like humping for
virginity.

14:00.166 --> 14:02.583
Just a few meetings?

14:02.667 --> 14:04.000
That's it.

14:06.000 --> 14:07.583
FBI sent over photos

14:07.667 --> 14:09.709
of the Jones Family
Philly
headquarters.

14:09.792 --> 14:12.250
See what Porter's
definition of a few is.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.917
Miller. In here. Now.

14:24.667 --> 14:26.583
'What's up?'

14:27.834 --> 14:30.417
How in the hell
do you open this
thing?

14:30.500 --> 14:33.083
There's this new device
called a straw.

14:33.166 --> 14:35.083
Straw?

14:38.542 --> 14:40.083
I didn't see that.

14:40.166 --> 14:43.208
Why don't you let the
four year old show you?

14:43.291 --> 14:46.291
Hey, Sean, how about
some juice, buddy?

14:46.375 --> 14:47.875
Sure.

14:54.041 --> 14:57.375
You wanna go interview a murder
suspect or something, boss?

14:57.458 --> 14:59.041
Calm yourself down?

15:01.709 --> 15:05.125
(Scotty)
'FBI surveillance photos.
The Jones Family.'

15:05.208 --> 15:06.583
(Rush)
'Porter's full of it.'

15:06.667 --> 15:07.667
They were at a lot of meetings.

15:07.750 --> 15:09.500
Nope, not Sara, though.

15:09.583 --> 15:11.750
No FBI files on any
of them specifically.

15:11.834 --> 15:13.959
Either they really only
attended meetings..

15:14.041 --> 15:16.333
Or they were never caught
blowing something up.

15:16.417 --> 15:18.834
Well, one of them
was handy with bombs.

15:18.917 --> 15:20.709
- What do you got?
- College files.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.917
Z took out
a lot of student loans.

15:23.000 --> 15:24.000
Paid them off
working summers

15:24.083 --> 15:25.583
at Helm Drilling & Blasting.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.417
Big construction company.

15:27.500 --> 15:28.709
Blasting?

15:28.792 --> 15:30.000
Z worked demolition.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.500
Peace-loving
hippie was an expert

15:31.583 --> 15:33.583
'with explosive devices.'

15:38.709 --> 15:40.375
(Vera)
Where were you in '71?

15:40.458 --> 15:42.500
(Jeffries)
Year out of the Air Force.
Worked a foot beat.

15:42.583 --> 15:44.959
(Vera)
Any run-ins with
these Jones Family punks?

15:45.041 --> 15:48.166
(Jeffries)
Nah, worked crowd control
at some protest marches.

15:48.250 --> 15:50.959
Thousands gathered right here.

15:51.041 --> 15:52.583
These kids ever go to class?

15:52.667 --> 15:55.417
Who has time for class when
there's a revolution going
on?

15:55.500 --> 15:57.125
Revolution my ass.

15:57.208 --> 16:00.208
Takes a silver spoon to
have so much time to protest.

16:00.291 --> 16:03.125
Most college kids' hearts
were in the right place.

16:03.208 --> 16:06.208
My uncle...served
two tours in Vietnam.

16:06.291 --> 16:07.667
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.542
Got home, walked
through the airport

16:10.625 --> 16:13.750
and two of those
good-hearted college students

16:13.834 --> 16:15.750
threw eggs in his face.

16:15.834 --> 16:18.208
Complicated times, Nick.

16:18.291 --> 16:19.917
Just like today.

16:24.625 --> 16:26.750
Professor Zimmerman?

16:30.375 --> 16:32.417
To what do I owe
the honor, detectives?

16:32.500 --> 16:33.583
(Vera)
'How'd you know who we are?'

16:33.667 --> 16:35.667
Oh, it's a talent I've long had.

16:35.750 --> 16:37.917
For spotting guys that
are gonna ruin your day?

16:38.000 --> 16:39.375
Philly Homicide.

16:39.458 --> 16:42.917
Got a few questions about
Jack and Johanna Kimball.

16:43.000 --> 16:45.250
Jack and Johanna?

16:45.333 --> 16:48.250
Turns out they were
murdered back in '81.

16:48.333 --> 16:50.375
(Vera)
'Accidental explosion
was really a bomb'

16:50.458 --> 16:52.041
planted behind
their kitchen stove.

16:52.125 --> 16:53.750
(Jeffries)
'Reminiscent of what
you and your pals'

16:53.834 --> 16:55.583
in the Jones
Family
used to do.

16:55.667 --> 16:59.083
I.. I can't believe this.

16:59.166 --> 17:01.709
Understand you knew a
thing
or two about explosives.

17:01.792 --> 17:04.583
(Jeffries)
'And you were in a fight
with Jack at your little..'

17:04.667 --> 17:06.208
...reunion party?

17:06.291 --> 17:08.542
Jack and I,
we worked it out.

17:08.625 --> 17:11.333
Yeah? Where were you
the night he died?

17:11.417 --> 17:12.375
I was already home.

17:12.458 --> 17:13.959
- 'Alone?'
- Yeah.

17:14.041 --> 17:15.041
(Vera)
'Great alibi, Z.'

17:15.125 --> 17:16.750
Did the butler do it, too?

17:16.834 --> 17:18.583
Look, um..

17:18.667 --> 17:22.542
...if anyone had a problem
with Jack that weekend..

17:22.625 --> 17:24.041
...it was Sara.

17:34.959 --> 17:37.375
I'm sorry I rode
your bicycle naked

17:37.458 --> 17:40.500
in a Ronald Reagan mask, Jack.

17:40.583 --> 17:41.834
Forget it.

17:41.917 --> 17:44.625
Wouldn't be a party
without seeing your
ass.

17:45.542 --> 17:47.542
I miss you, man.
That's all.

17:47.625 --> 17:50.250
I miss how it used
to be with all of us.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.458
So do I.

17:53.959 --> 17:55.458
(Z)
'You know what I'm gonna do?'

17:55.542 --> 17:57.166
(Jack)
'What are you gonna do?'

17:57.250 --> 18:00.125
When I go home tomorrow..

18:00.208 --> 18:03.166
...I'm gonna propose
to my girlfriend.

18:03.250 --> 18:06.417
Well, I thought you didn't
believe in the archaic

18:06.500 --> 18:08.208
oppressive bonds of marriage.

18:09.542 --> 18:11.667
Oh, you and Johanna
make it so cool.

18:11.750 --> 18:15.125
Oh, with Jo,
it's kind of
easy.

18:15.208 --> 18:17.458
You learn to love
the little things.

18:18.583 --> 18:20.709
Need some help, Sara?

18:24.333 --> 18:25.917
- Sara!
- What did you..

18:27.709 --> 18:29.125
I-I..

18:30.083 --> 18:31.709
I should have it, too.

18:31.792 --> 18:35.542
- What you and Johanna have.
- What are you talking?

18:35.625 --> 18:38.917
McBride was the only person
who ever loved me.

18:39.000 --> 18:40.583
And you killed him.

18:42.750 --> 18:45.083
Sara, I..
I am
sorry.

18:45.166 --> 18:46.667
I thought I could move on.

18:46.750 --> 18:49.542
I tried so hard.

18:49.625 --> 18:51.542
You guys have made
something of your lives.

18:51.625 --> 18:53.750
But...if I died..

18:53.834 --> 18:57.709
...if I vanished off the
face
of the earth tomorrow

18:57.792 --> 18:59.792
no one would even notice.

19:03.709 --> 19:06.417
You're the one who should be
dead, Jack, not McBride.

19:18.000 --> 19:20.917
- Who's McBride?
- He was Sara's boyfriend.

19:21.000 --> 19:22.625
He was a gung-ho radical

19:22.709 --> 19:25.208
who was inspired
by Jack's political writings.

19:25.291 --> 19:26.834
Anything specific?

19:26.917 --> 19:29.500
Jack had a catchphrase
that caught on.

19:29.583 --> 19:30.917
"Peace at any cost."

19:31.000 --> 19:33.709
- Meaning violence is okay?
- Yep.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.458
At the time,
Penn's Science Center

19:35.542 --> 19:37.875
had a defense contract
with the government.

19:39.041 --> 19:41.917
McBride got a
little carried away.

19:42.000 --> 19:43.333
How so?

19:43.417 --> 19:47.125
Well, he blew himself up
planting a bomb there.

19:54.792 --> 19:56.583
Your boyfriend died,
and you blamed Jack.

19:56.667 --> 19:58.750
Ten years later
you finally made him pay.

19:58.834 --> 20:00.959
Ten years later I was a mess.

20:01.041 --> 20:03.083
I didn't, I didn't have
the strength to get out of
bed.

20:03.166 --> 20:04.667
(Rush)
'Maybe you called
an old friend'

20:04.750 --> 20:06.291
in the Jones
Family
to do it for you.

20:06.375 --> 20:08.834
The Jones Family?
I was a pacifist.

20:09.917 --> 20:11.208
Didn't believe in that.

20:11.291 --> 20:12.625
But your boyfriend did.

20:12.709 --> 20:15.375
McBride was a gentle soul.

20:15.458 --> 20:16.959
He was the kindest guy
I ever met.

20:17.041 --> 20:18.333
Doesn't sound
like
the kind of guy

20:18.417 --> 20:20.625
who could blew up
a building on his
own.

20:24.250 --> 20:25.417
McBride had help, didn't he?

20:32.417 --> 20:34.125
The bombing was Jack's idea.

20:34.208 --> 20:36.000
He recruited McBride.

20:36.875 --> 20:38.208
They were all in on it.

20:38.291 --> 20:39.750
Who was?

20:39.834 --> 20:42.208
Jack...Porter..

20:42.291 --> 20:43.667
...Johanna, Z.

20:43.750 --> 20:46.333
They were all in the Science
Center when it went off.

20:46.417 --> 20:47.959
What about you?

20:48.041 --> 20:50.959
They kept me in the dark.
I didn't know until later.

20:52.083 --> 20:53.291
That's some secret.

20:55.583 --> 20:57.709
We were all dying inside.

20:59.417 --> 21:01.166
Jack was the only one..

21:01.250 --> 21:03.125
...who couldn't
live with it anymore.

21:19.417 --> 21:21.000
What happened?

21:21.083 --> 21:23.917
What happened is that
ten years ago we killed
someone.

21:24.000 --> 21:24.917
Jack.

21:25.000 --> 21:26.375
What happened...is that

21:26.458 --> 21:28.542
none of us can live with it.

21:28.625 --> 21:30.125
Look at Sara.

21:30.208 --> 21:32.834
Can't get up in
the morning without a pill.

21:32.917 --> 21:36.166
Z dulling the pain with booze.

21:36.250 --> 21:37.208
Me?

21:37.291 --> 21:38.291
Trying to buy peace of mind

21:38.375 --> 21:40.875
with BMWs and trips to Aspen.

21:40.959 --> 21:42.333
That's brilliant, Dr. Freud.

21:42.417 --> 21:45.166
It's the truth.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.208
Fact is, that's really why

21:46.291 --> 21:48.500
I brought us all together.

21:48.583 --> 21:51.709
You put McBride's
slide
in there on purpose?

21:51.792 --> 21:53.792
Maybe I did.

21:53.875 --> 21:56.542
We promised never, ever
to talk about this again.

21:56.625 --> 21:58.959
Guess I'm breaking that promise.

21:59.041 --> 22:01.959
Two weeks ago I got a call
from McBride's dad.

22:05.417 --> 22:07.750
(Roger)
'Uh...hello, Jack.'

22:07.834 --> 22:09.583
'Roger McBride again.'

22:09.667 --> 22:12.667
'I can't seem to reach you.'

22:12.750 --> 22:15.458
'Anyway, it's ten years
since we lost my boy'

22:15.542 --> 22:17.750
'and I've been
thinking about you.'

22:19.083 --> 22:21.000
'He really looked up
to you, Jack.'

22:21.083 --> 22:24.417
'I think a part of
his spirit lives in you'

22:24.500 --> 22:28.166
'and that comforts me.'

22:28.250 --> 22:31.333
'I'll never understand
why he did it.'

22:31.417 --> 22:34.000
'He was my only son.'

22:34.083 --> 22:36.583
'And time doesn't heal
a damn thing.'

22:36.667 --> 22:39.125
'It only makes it worse.'

22:44.667 --> 22:47.583
I haven't called him back.

22:47.667 --> 22:50.417
I'm not sure what I'd say.

22:50.500 --> 22:52.750
Maybe, um..

22:52.834 --> 22:54.125
"Hey, Mr. McBride

22:54.208 --> 22:56.125
"your son's death
was actually my fault.

22:56.208 --> 22:59.041
"I took a clean-cut kid
and made a killer out of him.

22:59.125 --> 23:01.125
- Please stop this.
- "He died in my arms.

23:01.208 --> 23:03.291
"Then I ran away like a coward.

23:03.375 --> 23:04.750
"Washed his blood off my jeans

23:04.834 --> 23:06.166
"like it was dirt.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.375
Can you ever forgive me?"

23:12.792 --> 23:15.125
I'm sorry, but McBride
knew the risks.

23:15.208 --> 23:16.458
He never would've
been there

23:16.542 --> 23:17.625
if I hadn't planned
the whole thing.

23:17.709 --> 23:19.458
We can't change the past.

23:19.542 --> 23:21.959
But we can change the future.

23:22.041 --> 23:23.375
The only way we're gonna heal

23:23.458 --> 23:25.458
is if the truth comes out.

23:25.542 --> 23:27.667
The truth means we go to jail.

23:30.250 --> 23:32.583
Monday morning..

23:32.667 --> 23:34.458
...I'm going to the cops.

23:48.542 --> 23:50.542
That was Saturday.

23:50.625 --> 23:53.875
- We all left that night.
- And Sunday he was dead?

23:53.959 --> 23:57.166
It looks like one of you
went back to shut him up.

23:57.250 --> 23:58.875
Well, I was proud of him.

23:58.959 --> 24:00.583
Well, you had
nothing to lose.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.083
You weren't directly involved

24:02.166 --> 24:03.709
in McBride's death.

24:04.917 --> 24:06.333
Leaves Porter and Z.

24:13.458 --> 24:15.166
"The boy closed the window.

24:15.250 --> 24:18.166
"Then the boy closed his eyes.

24:18.250 --> 24:19.291
And outside.."

24:19.375 --> 24:22.417
"The barn and all
the animals slept."

24:22.500 --> 24:23.792
That's right.

24:23.875 --> 24:26.834
Now, time for
some shut-eye.

24:26.917 --> 24:30.125
I don't wanna sleep.
I wanna go home.

24:30.208 --> 24:32.458
Oh, you gotta stay
here tonight, pal.

24:32.542 --> 24:33.709
Why?

24:33.792 --> 24:35.750
Because your mom and dad
are having a date.

24:35.834 --> 24:36.834
Why?

24:36.917 --> 24:39.125
[chuckles]
It's grown-up stuff.

24:41.125 --> 24:42.959
Time to hit the hay.

24:44.709 --> 24:45.792
How come Grandma Rita

24:45.875 --> 24:48.041
'doesn't live here?'

24:50.709 --> 24:53.291
Grandma Rita's
happy where she is.

24:53.375 --> 24:54.417
Why?

24:57.458 --> 24:59.959
Well..

25:01.458 --> 25:05.000
...Grandma Rita always used
to wonder when I'd be home..

25:05.083 --> 25:06.667
...where I was.

25:06.750 --> 25:09.000
It made her sad.

25:09.083 --> 25:10.208
'And now it's easier'

25:10.291 --> 25:11.834
for Grandma Rita.

25:11.917 --> 25:14.583
She doesn't have to worry
and be sad because..

25:17.250 --> 25:20.208
...because she doesn't have
to wait for me anymore.

25:24.709 --> 25:25.917
Now..

25:27.250 --> 25:29.250
How 'bout we both
get some sleep?

25:29.333 --> 25:31.083
Can you read it to me again?

25:31.166 --> 25:33.250
I just read it
to you twice, pal.

25:33.333 --> 25:36.208
One more time.
Please.

25:37.750 --> 25:38.667
Alright.

25:43.917 --> 25:45.625
"The sun came up

25:45.709 --> 25:47.333
and the rooster crowed."

25:53.125 --> 25:55.834
We got Z and Porter
in separate rooms.

25:55.917 --> 25:57.083
Play them against each other

25:57.166 --> 25:58.917
then pick the right
time
to shine the light.

25:59.000 --> 26:00.458
What, talk a deal?

26:00.542 --> 26:01.792
ADA Thomas said she's willing

26:01.875 --> 26:03.166
to take Involuntary on McBride

26:03.250 --> 26:05.917
if one of them confesses
to the Kimball job.

26:06.000 --> 26:06.917
Got it.

26:07.000 --> 26:08.041
Well, legally the DA

26:08.125 --> 26:09.125
can't lie to a suspect.

26:09.208 --> 26:11.500
Ah, but we can.

26:11.583 --> 26:13.667
I love this job.

26:17.125 --> 26:18.709
- Janie.
- 'Hey, dad.'

26:20.500 --> 26:22.125
Sean get off to school okay?

26:22.208 --> 26:24.041
Ah, piece of cake.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.667
How many times did he
get you to read "The Barnyard?"

26:25.750 --> 26:28.375
Twice.
Then he knew it was
bedtime.

26:30.208 --> 26:32.166
So, uh,
how'd things go?

26:35.083 --> 26:36.709
After you and mom,
I promised myself

26:36.792 --> 26:39.458
I would never
do this to Sean.

26:39.542 --> 26:42.000
You were so young,
you remember that, Janie?

26:43.041 --> 26:44.625
I never forgot.

26:48.083 --> 26:50.917
Well, sometimes
it's not so simple.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.792
It's not your fault.

26:54.709 --> 26:55.792
I know.

26:59.709 --> 27:02.166
So, how many times did you
really read him the book?

27:05.542 --> 27:07.208
He fell asleep on the fifth.

27:11.333 --> 27:15.208
(Valens)
Tell us more about
your pal McBride.

27:15.291 --> 27:16.875
'I already told you
everything I know.'

27:16.959 --> 27:20.041
Porter says you and McBride
planted that bomb together.

27:20.125 --> 27:23.208
Understand you were friends
with Paul McBride.

27:23.291 --> 27:24.333
Sara's boyfriend?

27:24.417 --> 27:25.709
Your pal Z says you and McBride

27:25.792 --> 27:27.291
planted a bomb together.

27:27.375 --> 27:29.375
(Rush)
'You're going down for
McBride right now.'

27:29.458 --> 27:30.542
(Valens)
Unless..

27:30.625 --> 27:31.583
Unless you come clean

27:31.667 --> 27:33.166
about the Kimballs' murder.

27:33.250 --> 27:36.166
Talk now or you'll be trading
in your six-bedroom house

27:36.250 --> 27:37.834
for a six-by-nine cell.

27:41.291 --> 27:44.542
Jack was going
to the cops about McBride.

27:44.625 --> 27:46.917
I wanted to stop him.
We all did.

27:47.000 --> 27:48.875
- So you killed him.
- No.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.417
I tried to reason with him.

27:53.000 --> 27:55.333
You're gonna shove us under
a bus to end your real guilt.

27:55.417 --> 27:56.750
My "real guilt?"

27:56.834 --> 27:59.417
The fact that you peddle
Yummy Bars to pay the mortgage.

27:59.500 --> 28:00.875
(Z)
'It's felony murder, Jack.'

28:00.959 --> 28:02.750
We could go away
for a long time.

28:02.834 --> 28:04.458
Yeah, prison
with hardcore murderers.

28:04.542 --> 28:05.500
You wanna repent?

28:05.583 --> 28:06.917
Do it on your own time.

28:07.000 --> 28:08.583
It's 1981.

28:08.667 --> 28:10.041
No one has sympathy
for what we were trying

28:10.125 --> 28:11.375
to accomplish in '71.

28:11.458 --> 28:12.375
We?

28:12.458 --> 28:13.583
The whole plan was Jack's idea.

28:13.667 --> 28:14.750
'Let's not forget that.'

28:14.834 --> 28:17.083
Well, I think Jack's right.

28:17.166 --> 28:18.250
How brave of you,
seeing as you've

28:18.333 --> 28:19.542
got nothing at stake here.

28:19.625 --> 28:21.750
We owe it to McBride
to tell the truth.

28:21.834 --> 28:22.959
Guess what, Sara?

28:23.041 --> 28:24.417
When you weren't around,
your precious love

28:24.500 --> 28:25.917
was bagging every hot
art major on campus.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.125
'So spare me
his sainthood.'

28:27.208 --> 28:28.875
That's not necessary, Porter.

28:28.959 --> 28:31.291
She wanted truth,
she can suck on it.

28:37.959 --> 28:39.542
Johanna..

28:39.625 --> 28:42.959
...what do you think?

28:43.041 --> 28:45.500
Remember how we used
to solve our disputes?

28:45.583 --> 28:46.792
Simple vote.

28:46.875 --> 28:48.291
True democracy.

28:48.375 --> 28:50.709
Don't you still
believe in that, Jack?

28:56.166 --> 28:57.458
Fine.

28:58.750 --> 29:02.500
"Yes," we turn ourselves in.

29:02.583 --> 29:06.458
"No," we never
discuss this again.

29:06.542 --> 29:09.083
Sounds good.

29:09.166 --> 29:11.333
Jack, I assume
you're a still a yes?

29:11.417 --> 29:13.125
Yes.

29:16.000 --> 29:18.083
Yes. We turn ourselves in.

29:21.917 --> 29:24.291
No way, Jose.

29:24.375 --> 29:26.291
I second that.

29:26.375 --> 29:29.667
That's two "no"s, two "yes."

29:29.750 --> 29:31.500
Jo..

29:31.583 --> 29:33.000
...you're the deciding vote.

29:39.083 --> 29:42.583
- No.
- What?

29:42.667 --> 29:44.792
I'm saying we
don't go to the
cops.

29:44.875 --> 29:47.000
I say we bury this forever

29:47.083 --> 29:48.583
once and for all.

29:59.000 --> 30:01.750
And with that, it was over.

30:01.834 --> 30:05.333
And you all went
on your merry way?

30:05.417 --> 30:07.542
Well, it wasn't merry.

30:07.625 --> 30:08.709
I'll tell you that.

30:08.792 --> 30:10.458
We were just glad it was over.

30:10.542 --> 30:12.709
And Jack was gonna
abide by the vote?

30:12.792 --> 30:14.709
No way. No, not that guy.

30:17.166 --> 30:19.625
What are you hiding, Z?

30:19.709 --> 30:21.750
I got nothing to hide.

30:21.834 --> 30:23.291
The fact is..

30:23.375 --> 30:25.583
...Jack still
couldn't let it go.

30:33.750 --> 30:36.583
What we did, Jo,
it's killing us all.

30:36.667 --> 30:37.792
Can't you see that?

30:37.875 --> 30:40.750
And this is how
we help each
other?

30:40.834 --> 30:43.250
(Johanna)
'I told Sara she can
stay with us for a while.'

30:43.333 --> 30:44.417
She needs us.

30:44.500 --> 30:47.041
And we need
to face what we did.

30:47.125 --> 30:48.542
McBride is dead.

30:48.625 --> 30:50.834
And it's awful, and
I'm sorry for his
father

30:50.917 --> 30:53.375
'but there's nothing
we can do to bring him back.'

30:53.458 --> 30:56.750
But we can bring
ourselves back.

30:56.834 --> 30:58.875
Jack, you might be
right
about the others.

30:58.959 --> 31:00.417
But I'm happy..

31:00.500 --> 31:01.917
...with all we
have,
with who we are.

31:02.000 --> 31:03.083
Jo, Jo!

31:03.166 --> 31:05.041
I've fought so hard
to get here, Jack.

31:05.125 --> 31:06.875
I can't start again.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.917
I can't go back to
being
the poor kid with
nothing.

31:15.792 --> 31:18.583
Remember what my mom used
to say about the Cattleyas?

31:21.583 --> 31:23.625
I know. Family.

31:23.709 --> 31:26.125
Yeah.

31:26.208 --> 31:29.250
What about the family
that we wanted to start?

31:29.333 --> 31:32.125
Jack, we're finally ready.

31:32.208 --> 31:34.583
I can't start
anything right
now.

31:34.667 --> 31:36.792
That is the problem.

31:36.875 --> 31:38.250
You saying you don't love me?

31:38.333 --> 31:40.083
No, I'm saying that
I have to make this
right.

31:40.166 --> 31:42.583
Even if that means
going to jail?

31:42.667 --> 31:45.041
Never seeing each other again.

31:57.542 --> 31:58.750
'But you're sure..'

31:58.834 --> 32:00.792
...Johanna said that
about the orchids?

32:00.875 --> 32:03.000
Symbol of family?

32:03.083 --> 32:04.125
Yeah.

32:04.208 --> 32:07.208
The exact same thing
Sara told us.

32:10.375 --> 32:13.166
According to Z, Sara was
staying
at the house a few more days.

32:13.250 --> 32:15.750
Sara forgot to
mention
that little detail
to us.

32:15.834 --> 32:19.458
Ran her 1970
fingerprints
against her current
prints.

32:19.542 --> 32:21.625
Thing is, they don't match.

32:22.542 --> 32:24.959
But these do.

32:25.041 --> 32:28.500
- Whose are they?
- Johanna's.

32:28.583 --> 32:31.667
Sara Lowell is
really
Johanna Kimball.

32:33.083 --> 32:35.625
The real Sara must've
died in the blast.

32:35.709 --> 32:38.208
Johanna stole her identity.

32:38.291 --> 32:40.834
And ran.

32:46.083 --> 32:47.709
Still no whereabouts on Johanna.

32:47.792 --> 32:49.458
Mm. She's running again.

32:49.542 --> 32:51.625
(Stillman)
'Miller's talking
to the family.'

32:51.709 --> 32:53.709
Hey, Louie traced the
serial number on the pipe cap

32:53.792 --> 32:56.166
to a batch that was
purchased by Marshall Corp.

32:56.250 --> 32:58.417
Oh, where Porter worked in '81.

32:58.500 --> 33:00.792
Looks like
we got our bomb-maker.

33:02.291 --> 33:05.291
You stay in touch with
Sara
after that weekend?

33:05.375 --> 33:07.458
Sara?

33:07.542 --> 33:09.792
We weren't exactly
exchanging Christmas cards.

33:10.750 --> 33:12.625
I never saw her again.

33:12.709 --> 33:16.250
We know you
made the
bomb...Einstein.

33:16.333 --> 33:20.709
And you had
the hots for
Johanna.

33:20.792 --> 33:22.709
I guess it doesn't matter.

33:22.792 --> 33:25.583
She's been dead so long.

33:25.667 --> 33:28.417
It was Johanna's idea.

33:28.500 --> 33:31.250
But something went wrong.

33:31.333 --> 33:32.917
She wasn't supposed
to be in the house.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.208
Just Jack.

33:34.291 --> 33:36.125
Your best friend.

33:36.208 --> 33:37.458
You gotta understand.

33:37.542 --> 33:39.625
I did it for
the woman I loved.

33:40.542 --> 33:42.834
When did Johanna
come to you?

33:42.917 --> 33:44.917
I was packing to leave.

33:54.959 --> 33:57.000
Jack's still going to the cops.

33:59.125 --> 34:00.333
What?

34:00.417 --> 34:01.417
I thought we
all decided.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.917
He doesn't care.

34:04.041 --> 34:05.458
Well, you got
to stop him, Jo.

34:05.542 --> 34:07.333
He won't listen to me.

34:07.417 --> 34:11.291
He's throwing everything
away,
including me.

34:11.375 --> 34:13.625
I'm scared, Porter.

34:13.709 --> 34:15.208
I'm so scared.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.917
Maybe I was wrong
about everything.

34:20.000 --> 34:21.917
What do you mean?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.667
The decisions
I made back then

34:24.750 --> 34:26.333
about you and Jack.

34:28.041 --> 34:30.625
I have thought
about it, you know.

34:30.709 --> 34:34.166
That summer..

34:34.250 --> 34:37.375
We were together.

34:37.458 --> 34:39.917
Maybe this is
a chance to start
over.

34:41.500 --> 34:43.125
Yeah, but..

34:43.208 --> 34:45.625
...in jail, on the run?

34:46.750 --> 34:49.166
There's another way.

34:49.250 --> 34:52.208
I keep thinking about
Jack's writings, his
words.

35:00.542 --> 35:02.500
"Peace at any cost."

35:02.583 --> 35:04.041
Yes.

35:06.500 --> 35:08.667
What are we talking about, Jo?

35:10.083 --> 35:12.500
You and me not giving
up
what we've got.

35:14.083 --> 35:15.834
You and me?

35:18.083 --> 35:19.250
Yes.

35:32.750 --> 35:34.583
It was a simple plan.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.750
The stove knob
triggered the bomb.

35:36.834 --> 35:39.583
Jo should have been
long gone, meeting me.

35:40.583 --> 35:43.375
But she didn't show.

35:43.458 --> 35:45.375
Hmm.

35:45.458 --> 35:48.083
All I wanted
was her, and I..

35:49.333 --> 35:50.625
...I killed her.

35:54.125 --> 35:56.834
Sara was staying
in the house, Porter.

35:58.125 --> 36:00.750
You killed her, not Johanna.

36:03.291 --> 36:05.542
(Vera)
'Forgot to loop you in, huh?'

36:05.625 --> 36:08.291
Maybe that summer wasn't
so special after all.

36:11.083 --> 36:13.333
Whoo!

36:16.875 --> 36:18.583
Oh, your daughter's good.

36:18.667 --> 36:21.166
Thank you.

36:21.250 --> 36:23.792
(Rush)
You've carved quite a
life
for yourself, haven't

36:23.875 --> 36:26.542
Beautiful house,
beautiful family.

36:28.542 --> 36:30.834
I wonder what Johanna
would think of this.

36:32.667 --> 36:34.667
Where was Johanna from?

36:34.750 --> 36:36.208
- Uh, New Jersey.
- Right.

36:36.291 --> 36:39.041
In a tiny apartment in
Newark,
out-of-work father.

36:40.208 --> 36:42.250
Grew up poor.

36:43.458 --> 36:46.000
You do your homework.

36:46.083 --> 36:47.041
Yeah, all of you came from

36:47.125 --> 36:49.291
money except for Johanna.

36:50.417 --> 36:53.458
She worked her
way through
school.

36:53.542 --> 36:55.166
Struggled.

36:57.208 --> 37:00.542
I bet she would have given
anything to have this.

37:00.625 --> 37:01.792
Done anything.

37:12.792 --> 37:14.750
Please.

37:14.834 --> 37:16.709
I know who you are, Johanna.

37:21.542 --> 37:23.208
(Rush)
'Does it haunt you?'

37:23.291 --> 37:26.458
When you steal a life,
do you leave your soul behind?

37:26.542 --> 37:28.458
Don't do this here, please.

37:28.542 --> 37:30.542
Tell me what happened, Johanna.

37:37.291 --> 37:39.959
All I ever wanted was a family.

37:41.375 --> 37:43.834
A garden.

37:43.917 --> 37:45.583
Peace.

37:45.667 --> 37:46.917
And you killed for it.

37:48.500 --> 37:50.166
I loved Jack.

37:50.250 --> 37:51.792
Strange way to show it.

37:55.458 --> 37:57.166
I'm not a monster.

37:57.250 --> 37:59.041
What are you then?

38:01.250 --> 38:02.750
A coward.

38:09.417 --> 38:11.500
Sara's taking a walk.

38:11.583 --> 38:12.834
It's just you and me.

38:16.166 --> 38:17.417
Let's go to bed, sweetie.

38:17.500 --> 38:19.125
Tomorrow morning we
should get on a
plane.

38:19.208 --> 38:21.333
Go somewhere, anywhere.

38:22.250 --> 38:23.750
Jo, there's no running away.

38:23.834 --> 38:25.458
We've been under
a lot of stress

38:25.542 --> 38:28.000
with work,
with this
reunion.

38:29.125 --> 38:31.000
Let's take a
break,
you and me.

38:32.333 --> 38:34.208
I can't.

38:42.834 --> 38:45.250
Remember that day?

38:46.792 --> 38:49.125
We got a flat tire.

38:49.208 --> 38:51.166
Pulled into a park.

38:52.500 --> 38:55.041
Walked down to that lake.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.375
Best flat tire I ever had.

39:04.583 --> 39:06.959
I thought it was you and
me
against the world.

39:07.041 --> 39:09.667
It still is.

39:09.750 --> 39:11.917
Let's do this together.
Be strong with me, Jo.

39:13.875 --> 39:16.125
You always were
the strong one.

39:17.375 --> 39:19.291
It isn't strength.

39:20.792 --> 39:23.250
It's like
I don't have a choice.

39:25.834 --> 39:28.583
No choice.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.083
I think I understand now.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.625
Good.

39:51.125 --> 39:52.917
Let's go to bed.

39:53.000 --> 39:55.375
I'll be up in a second.
