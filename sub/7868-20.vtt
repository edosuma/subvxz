Oh, yeah!

01:23.359 --> 01:24.793
Ooh, yeah!

01:24.832 --> 01:28.535
Duffman is here to
refill your beers!

01:28.602 --> 01:29.936
Okay. Thank you.

01:30.004 --> 01:32.906
Now, for the only thing
better than Duff.

01:32.973 --> 01:34.541
Better than Duff?

01:34.608 --> 01:36.576
Free Duff stuff!

01:36.644 --> 01:37.711
Oh, yeah! Oh!

01:37.778 --> 01:40.513
Now, who wants... beer cozies?!

01:40.581 --> 01:42.215
A shirt that says "Yo!"

01:42.283 --> 01:44.350
Sassy seat cushions!

01:44.418 --> 01:48.722
And flash drives for your PC
so you can take your data and

01:48.789 --> 01:51.291
back it up!

01:51.358 --> 01:52.992
Whoa! I need some of that.

01:53.060 --> 01:55.195
And now, Duffman has a dinner date

01:55.262 --> 01:56.963
with his estranged daughter.

01:57.031 --> 01:59.766
Must not bring up why she
dropped out of college.

01:59.834 --> 02:01.534
It's too sad!

02:01.602 --> 02:04.037
Huh. Huh. Hey. Ha! Ha!

02:04.105 --> 02:06.139
Guess what company

02:06.207 --> 02:09.241
had a giveaway at Moe's last night?

02:09.310 --> 02:10.243
No, I won't.

02:10.311 --> 02:12.779
Keep guessing.

02:12.847 --> 02:14.681
What's it say, boy?

02:14.749 --> 02:16.082
Responsibly.

02:16.150 --> 02:17.484
Oh!

02:18.719 --> 02:20.153
Kid, you've been staring

02:20.221 --> 02:22.889
at these gelatin
desserts for 15 minutes.

02:22.957 --> 02:24.224
Pick one!

02:24.291 --> 02:26.493
It's so hard to decide.

02:26.560 --> 02:29.429
Is the yellow one
lemon or pineapple?

02:29.497 --> 02:30.630
It's your pet canary.

02:30.698 --> 02:31.731
Now scram!

02:34.135 --> 02:35.668
Hey. Haw haw!

02:35.736 --> 02:36.870
You're a spaz!

02:36.937 --> 02:38.638
That's not true.

02:38.706 --> 02:41.007
First of all, Milhouse fell
because you tripped him.

02:41.075 --> 02:44.477
Secondly, spaz is short
for spastic diplegic,

02:44.545 --> 02:47.147
someone who suffers from a
serious medical condition.

02:47.214 --> 02:49.949
Thirdly, your "haw haw,
" through overuse,

02:50.017 --> 02:51.951
has lost its power.

02:52.019 --> 02:53.319
Wow.

02:53.387 --> 02:55.421
I bow before your logic.

03:00.027 --> 03:01.928
Excuse me.

03:01.996 --> 03:04.430
I couldn't help but notice
how logically you argue.

03:05.900 --> 03:08.501
Well, I am one: flattered,
and two: intrigued.

03:08.569 --> 03:09.969
Lisa Simpson.

03:10.037 --> 03:11.337
Ms. Dubinsky.

03:11.405 --> 03:13.907
I'd like to invite you
to join our debate team.

03:13.974 --> 03:16.009
I didn't know we had a debate team.

03:16.076 --> 03:18.144
Well, it's the one
extracurricular activity

03:18.212 --> 03:20.747
that can't be cut,
because it requires no equipment.

03:20.815 --> 03:22.282
We're low on funding,

03:22.349 --> 03:24.784
so Ralph Wiggum will be
standing in as your lectern.

03:26.220 --> 03:28.021
I'm a furniture!

03:31.192 --> 03:32.492
And that is why

03:32.560 --> 03:34.327
hybrid car buyers
should be given rebates

03:34.395 --> 03:36.763
paid for by taxes on hamburgers.

03:38.499 --> 03:39.332
Thank you, Lisa.

03:39.400 --> 03:40.300
Excuse me.

03:40.367 --> 03:41.401
The podiums are needed

03:41.468 --> 03:43.036
in the art room as easels.

03:43.103 --> 03:46.272
Yay!

03:46.340 --> 03:47.941
Megan, cross-examination.

03:48.008 --> 03:50.710
What if someone's driving an old,
but functioning, car?

03:50.778 --> 03:52.111
Wouldn't the carbon required

03:52.179 --> 03:54.647
to create a new hybrid
exceed the savings in gas?

03:54.715 --> 03:56.115
Initially yes, but...

03:56.183 --> 03:58.518
And isn't most electricity
in the United States

03:58.586 --> 04:00.653
ultimately derived from
the burning of coal?

04:00.721 --> 04:02.856
Currently. However,
solar and wind are...

04:02.923 --> 04:05.925
The sun and the breeze-
the two things you know a lot about.

04:05.993 --> 04:07.126
Right, Blondie?

04:07.194 --> 04:08.027
Blondie?!

04:08.095 --> 04:09.696
Like, totally.

04:09.763 --> 04:11.564
Why don't we get a
bitchin' new perm

04:11.632 --> 04:13.700
with daddy's credit card?

04:14.602 --> 04:15.969
First of all,

04:16.036 --> 04:18.438
my father no longer has any
functioning credit cards.

04:18.505 --> 04:20.106
Secondly, how dare you refer to...

04:20.173 --> 04:22.108
Ooh, you can count to two. Aah.

04:22.176 --> 04:24.377
Do you need some ice on your head?

04:25.546 --> 04:26.679
I... I...

04:28.849 --> 04:30.817
The winner by a hair--

04:30.885 --> 04:33.119
a brown hair-- Megan!

04:33.187 --> 04:34.520
Ooh!

04:34.588 --> 04:35.922
Sir, that hollow mountain in Nevada

04:35.990 --> 04:37.757
that was supposed to
hold a million years

04:37.825 --> 04:39.859
of nuclear waste is full.

04:39.927 --> 04:42.695
Did they jump on the
pile to smoosh it down?

04:42.763 --> 04:45.265
It went down in one
place and up in another.

04:45.332 --> 04:47.567
We need somewhere else to
dispose of this plutonium.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.869
Eh, just find the biggest
idiot on our payroll

04:49.937 --> 04:51.437
and slip it in his bag.

04:55.209 --> 04:56.542
Ooh!

04:56.610 --> 04:58.544
That's a bingo.

04:58.612 --> 05:01.581
Mmm. Good mac and cheese.

05:01.649 --> 05:03.082
I've had better.

05:03.150 --> 05:06.319
Down at the train station.

05:06.387 --> 05:07.921
I'll have to check it out sometime.

05:07.988 --> 05:09.689
Mmm!

05:09.757 --> 05:11.824
The best mac and cheese
<i>I've</i> ever had

05:11.892 --> 05:13.760
is at a bowling
alley in Ogdenville.

05:13.827 --> 05:15.728
Mm, I am pretty full.

05:15.796 --> 05:17.563
Breadcrumbs on the top.

05:17.631 --> 05:19.565
I'm on my way!

05:21.902 --> 05:24.470
That bag-- surely it's attended.

05:25.973 --> 05:28.808
Unattended bag!

05:30.210 --> 05:32.645
All panic!

05:39.620 --> 05:41.154
So, what do you think?

05:41.221 --> 05:42.855
I think we're gonna blow it up

05:42.923 --> 05:45.325
and let the bleeding heart
liberals ask questions later.

05:45.392 --> 05:49.128
Well, now, why can't it be
blown up by a woman of color?

05:49.196 --> 05:50.763
Five, four.

05:50.831 --> 05:52.932
No time for a full countdown.

05:56.170 --> 05:58.137
Ooh, it's dinner time!

06:01.859 --> 06:02.426
This just in.

06:02.604 --> 06:05.705
The suspicious bag detonated at
Springfield Union Station today

06:05.790 --> 06:07.123
contained deadly plutonium,

06:07.191 --> 06:09.959
which can only mean one thing-
a terrorist plot.

06:10.027 --> 06:11.394
Enough radioactivity was released

06:11.462 --> 06:14.597
to create 17 Hulks
and a Spider-Man.

06:14.751 --> 06:16.552
Here's an artist's conception.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.521
Quite disturbing.

06:21.291 --> 06:22.425
I admit it.

06:22.492 --> 06:23.793
Everything I've said

06:23.860 --> 06:26.262
about terrorism till
now was fear-mongering.

06:26.330 --> 06:28.397
But today, I monger the truth.

06:28.465 --> 06:31.334
To protect our city from
all future bombings,

06:31.401 --> 06:34.136
dirty, clean, dive or carpet,

06:34.204 --> 06:35.871
we have hired an outside consultant

06:35.939 --> 06:37.540
from London, England.

06:37.608 --> 06:39.542
Does he have a cute accent?

06:39.610 --> 06:41.377
Why don't you be the judge,
young lady?

06:41.445 --> 06:44.046
Ooh, he sounds just
like Paddington Bear!

06:44.114 --> 06:46.115
My name is Nigel Bakerbutcher.

06:47.718 --> 06:49.185
Sleepy London town.

06:49.253 --> 06:52.188
<i>Once upon a time, the
only problem we had here</i>

06:52.256 --> 06:54.590
<i>was from overzealous Cockney
flower sellers.</i>

06:54.658 --> 06:55.625
Flowers, guv'nor?

06:55.692 --> 06:56.859
A pretty for your buttonhole?

06:56.927 --> 06:57.994
'Ello, 'ello, 'ello.

06:59.363 --> 07:01.097
But in London of the 21st century,

07:01.164 --> 07:03.366
the watchword is vigilance.

07:03.433 --> 07:07.937
<i>London is now ringed by the most
comprehensive array</i>

07:08.005 --> 07:10.673
<i>of surveillance cameras mankind
has ever seen.</i>

07:25.522 --> 07:26.922
Excuse me.

07:26.990 --> 07:29.825
Is this what the framers of
the constitution would want?

07:29.893 --> 07:31.994
Well, I'm Wally of Wally's Framers,

07:32.062 --> 07:33.929
and this is exactly what I want.

07:33.997 --> 07:37.366
How many personal freedoms
are we willing to give up

07:37.434 --> 07:38.901
in the name of security?

07:40.370 --> 07:43.773
That blonde girl thinks she's smart,
like us dark hairs.

07:43.840 --> 07:46.108
Again with the blonde!

07:46.176 --> 07:48.577
Why in the world would
the color of the hair

07:48.645 --> 07:50.379
on someone's head
have anything to do

07:50.447 --> 07:52.081
with the intelligence within?

07:52.149 --> 07:54.350
Yeah, you're so right.

07:54.418 --> 07:56.419
I'm smart, too.

07:56.486 --> 08:00.389
I got Joe to promise to leave
his wife when I turn 50.

08:00.457 --> 08:01.824
Eh, uh, yes.

08:01.892 --> 08:06.162
Now, all in favor of
these cameras say cheese.

08:06.229 --> 08:07.697
ALL Cheese!

08:07.764 --> 08:10.800
Those opposed say,
"I hate America."

08:10.867 --> 08:12.001
I ha...

08:12.069 --> 08:13.302
Oh, wait.

08:13.370 --> 08:14.470
Oh.

08:14.538 --> 08:16.739
Motion carries.

08:16.807 --> 08:20.343
Next up: motion to limit
terms of city officials.

08:20.410 --> 08:23.245
All in favor say,
"I have sex with animals."

08:23.313 --> 08:25.648
I <i>do</i> have sex with animals,

08:25.716 --> 08:28.050
but I am not in favor
of term limits.

08:28.118 --> 08:29.318
Mm-hmm.

08:31.121 --> 08:34.457
Lisa, I know kids have been
making fun of your blonde hair,

08:34.524 --> 08:36.125
so I got you this book

08:36.193 --> 08:38.294
from the Being Different
section of the bookstore.

08:38.361 --> 08:40.895
Hmm?

08:40.964 --> 08:44.133
"Sally Circle was eating
donuts and Ovaltine

08:44.201 --> 08:46.569
when her father came
in with terrible news."

08:46.636 --> 08:48.838
We're moving to Rectangu-Land!

08:48.905 --> 08:51.407
Round up the family and let's roll!

08:51.475 --> 08:53.576
"Everyone was mean to Sally.

08:53.643 --> 08:55.144
"She was too well-rounded.

08:55.212 --> 08:56.579
"She felt cornered.

08:56.646 --> 08:58.381
"They wouldn't let
her play four-square

08:58.448 --> 09:00.383
"or invite her to the box social.

09:00.450 --> 09:01.717
The end."

09:01.785 --> 09:05.154
That's a rather unambitious book.

09:05.222 --> 09:07.990
I want a camera on
every light pole.

09:08.058 --> 09:09.859
I want two hidden cameras there,
open camera there.

09:09.926 --> 09:11.127
Hidden. Hidden.

09:11.194 --> 09:11.894
Hidden.

09:13.730 --> 09:14.864
Hidden.

09:14.931 --> 09:17.133
Cluster! Right there! Yes!

09:17.200 --> 09:20.336
Um, you ain't gonna
like what you see.

09:20.404 --> 09:22.605
Did you hear about the
blonde who couldn't make ice?

09:22.672 --> 09:25.274
She lost the recipe.

09:25.342 --> 09:27.877
You know why it takes longer
to build a blonde snowman?

09:27.944 --> 09:29.678
You have to hollow out the head.

09:35.352 --> 09:37.186
He sure nailed you, Lis.

09:37.254 --> 09:38.954
You're blond, too.

09:39.022 --> 09:40.523
Blonde <i>guys</i> aren't dumb.

09:40.590 --> 09:41.991
They're evil.

09:42.058 --> 09:43.793
Like in <i>The Karate Kid</i>
and World War II.

09:46.296 --> 09:47.797
All right, boys.

09:47.864 --> 09:51.066
Let's see the dark
underbelly of our fair burg.

09:56.406 --> 09:57.740
Okay, we got a litterbug

09:57.808 --> 10:01.510
on F-6, double homicide
in progress on Q-20...

10:01.578 --> 10:04.013
A woman sunbathing topless on R-15!

10:04.080 --> 10:06.048
Uh, Chief, I think we got a misuse

10:06.116 --> 10:08.050
of police equipment on ZZ-99.

10:08.118 --> 10:10.419
Killjoy.

10:12.389 --> 10:15.424
Gas station customer
washing windshield

10:15.492 --> 10:17.193
without buying gas.

10:17.260 --> 10:19.128
Girl using Wite-Out as nail polish.

10:19.196 --> 10:21.130
Oh, man, this is hard.

10:21.198 --> 10:24.166
Hey, did you get that guy who
was parading around naked?

10:24.234 --> 10:26.702
He was just jogging in a
tan sweat suit, Chief.

10:26.770 --> 10:28.671
Are you sure?
I thought I saw his...

10:28.738 --> 10:30.973
That was a fanny pack,
worn on the front.

10:31.041 --> 10:31.941
But there was a... Water bottle...

10:32.008 --> 10:32.942
But it was... Leaking.

10:33.009 --> 10:34.343
That's it! That's it!

10:34.411 --> 10:36.912
I can't take another minute
of these stupid screens!

10:36.980 --> 10:39.348
Go-Go find some concerned citizens

10:39.416 --> 10:40.783
to pick up the slack.

10:40.851 --> 10:42.284
Well, how many should I get?

10:42.352 --> 10:45.321
Uh, well, we've got, uh,
eight chairs, so...

10:45.388 --> 10:46.555
Oh, no, wait.

10:46.623 --> 10:48.524
Put one chair in my
office facing my desk,

10:48.592 --> 10:50.292
so-so I'll seem
like a meetings guy.

10:50.360 --> 10:51.460
Yeah. Oh, uh...

10:51.528 --> 10:52.695
Oh, have a seat.

10:52.762 --> 10:54.797
Uh, I'll be with you
in one minute. Yeah.

10:54.865 --> 10:55.865
Ah, that's a new low.

10:57.434 --> 10:59.168
We have chosen you to help out,

10:59.236 --> 11:01.804
because you are all
that rare combination.

11:01.872 --> 11:03.839
Prying, but not pervy.

11:05.575 --> 11:09.011
Now just follow a little
formula called P.B. and J.:

11:09.079 --> 11:12.715
Peer at the monitor,
Be judgmental, and Jot it down.

11:12.782 --> 11:15.150
One way to remember that is A.B.C.:

11:15.218 --> 11:18.120
Always Be Considering P.B. and J.

11:18.188 --> 11:20.689
But the single most important
rule is the four A's:

11:20.757 --> 11:23.225
Always Act According to A.B.C.

11:26.663 --> 11:27.863
Uh-oh.

11:27.931 --> 11:29.064
What is it, Ned?

11:29.132 --> 11:30.866
I've got two teens in a public park

11:30.934 --> 11:32.167
goin' at it like a
couple of gibbons

11:32.235 --> 11:33.669
in the back seat of Noah's Ark!

11:33.737 --> 11:35.304
Should we inform the Chief?

11:35.372 --> 11:36.639
Hmm, maybe.

11:36.706 --> 11:38.807
But I feel a little
like I'm the Tom Voyeur

11:38.875 --> 11:40.809
to these Huckleberry Sinners.

11:40.877 --> 11:42.845
Or you could correct
the behavior yourself

11:42.913 --> 11:45.314
with our Nag-a-sonic speakers.

11:45.382 --> 11:47.650
Oi! Snogging people!

11:47.717 --> 11:49.418
What the hell was that?!

11:49.486 --> 11:51.153
Tongues where I can
see them, please.

11:51.221 --> 11:53.856
I ain't lettin' you touch
me with somebody watchin'.

11:53.924 --> 11:56.292
Come on, baby, it's just a voice.

11:56.359 --> 11:57.993
Don't push it, Kearney.

11:58.061 --> 11:59.962
I'm Jimbo! Oh, great.

12:00.030 --> 12:02.431
Make me look easy in
front of the voice.

12:02.499 --> 12:04.199
But you are easy!

12:04.267 --> 12:06.669
Don't be ashamed of what you are!

12:06.736 --> 12:07.970
Shauna...

12:08.038 --> 12:10.873
I've gone from
lookie-loo to talkie-too.

12:10.941 --> 12:14.310
Excuse me, that's your salad fork.

12:14.377 --> 12:16.445
That Wi-Fi's for hotel guests only.

12:16.513 --> 12:20.182
What's the matter, sir,
too cool to sing "Happy Birthday?"

12:20.250 --> 12:21.717
Isn't this great, Marge?

12:21.785 --> 12:24.186
We're like Jiminy Cricket for
the whole ding-dang town.

12:24.254 --> 12:27.356
A half-man, half-bug that knows
what's best for everybody.

12:27.424 --> 12:28.757
Mm-hmm.

12:28.825 --> 12:30.492
I don't know.

12:30.560 --> 12:32.394
I'm starting to think
we're prying too much

12:32.462 --> 12:34.029
into people's lives.

12:34.097 --> 12:36.098
And this room isn't
really the best place

12:36.166 --> 12:37.666
for Maggie to hang out.

12:37.734 --> 12:39.001
That's not <i>Sesame Street,</i>

12:39.069 --> 12:40.536
that's a gay bar.

12:46.276 --> 12:47.509
Although I guess

12:47.577 --> 12:49.845
this would teach her
sharing and caring,

12:49.913 --> 12:51.747
but... we're going home.

13:07.364 --> 13:09.832
Dye! Dye! Dye!

13:13.570 --> 13:15.537
Tomorrow's forecast is...

13:15.605 --> 13:17.272
Okay, place your bets.

13:17.340 --> 13:19.074
Partly cloudy. Partly sunny.

13:19.142 --> 13:20.609
Golf ball-sized hail!

13:20.677 --> 13:22.645
A chance of severe thunderstorms

13:22.712 --> 13:24.980
with golf ball-sized hail!

13:25.048 --> 13:26.315
Whoo-hoo!

13:27.717 --> 13:30.953
I spy, with my electronic eye,
illegal wagering!

13:31.021 --> 13:32.755
Hey, weren't these
cameras installed

13:32.822 --> 13:35.824
to keep America's enemies
from blowin' up our homeland?

13:35.892 --> 13:37.826
Well, sir, how many times
have you been blown up

13:37.894 --> 13:39.094
since the cameras went in?

13:39.162 --> 13:40.462
Zero times.

13:40.530 --> 13:41.897
Mm-hmm!

13:41.965 --> 13:44.266
Now I'm gonna go

13:44.334 --> 13:45.901
till you give the money back.

13:47.003 --> 13:48.804
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

13:51.541 --> 13:52.508
Cut it out...

13:52.575 --> 13:54.176
Cut it out!

13:55.779 --> 13:57.513
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm-mm!

13:57.580 --> 13:58.681
All right!

13:58.748 --> 14:00.149
All right!

14:00.216 --> 14:01.183
I'm goin' home.

14:01.251 --> 14:02.785
It's not safe in here.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.526
Don't use that dog as a ramp.

14:10.593 --> 14:13.629
Less radical... Less radical!

14:14.898 --> 14:16.165
Stop gleaming that cube!

14:21.037 --> 14:22.971
So, you like to watch, huh?

14:23.039 --> 14:24.673
Well, take a look at this!

14:25.875 --> 14:27.276
Huh?

14:27.343 --> 14:29.411
Hmm.

14:29.479 --> 14:31.380
Buttocks!

14:31.448 --> 14:32.981
Tushie!

14:33.049 --> 14:35.451
Ugh!

14:35.518 --> 14:37.252
Whoa, a blind spot!

14:42.559 --> 14:45.194
Boy cheeks!

14:45.261 --> 14:47.062
Fanny!

14:47.130 --> 14:49.031
Derriere!

14:49.099 --> 14:51.533
Hiney!

14:51.601 --> 14:53.535
Backside!

14:53.603 --> 14:55.571
Cover up that coin slot!

14:55.638 --> 14:56.939
Hey, boy, whatcha doing?

14:57.006 --> 14:58.574
Experimenting with my butt.

14:58.641 --> 15:00.943
My little Einstein.

15:09.166 --> 15:11.700
Welcome to Chaos Corners,
the Pleasure Patch,

15:11.768 --> 15:13.536
Satan's Triangle--

15:13.603 --> 15:15.671
the one place in town
no cameras can see you,

15:15.739 --> 15:17.506
and no laws can touch you.

15:21.878 --> 15:23.646
Oh, yeah, that stopped the kicking.

15:28.251 --> 15:30.352
Inspiration Point looks
pretty uninspired.

15:30.420 --> 15:31.954
All's quiet in Murder Town.

15:32.022 --> 15:35.691
Yep, Springfield is cleaner
than the Lord's hand towels.

15:35.759 --> 15:38.527
Sour ball, take me away!

15:38.595 --> 15:40.763
Mm-mm-mmm.

15:40.831 --> 15:42.798
Mmm! Mm-mmm... mmm.

15:52.676 --> 15:54.443
Another tie.

15:54.511 --> 15:57.413
Followed by three hours
of parachute repacking.

15:59.783 --> 16:00.716
Koo-koo-roo! Koo-koo-roo!

16:00.784 --> 16:02.952
A phony bird call?!

16:03.019 --> 16:04.220
That means Marge is coming!

16:04.287 --> 16:05.354
Everyone, act legal!

16:17.267 --> 16:20.803
Homer, Maggie has to wear
that clown mask for Halloween.

16:20.871 --> 16:22.338
What's going on?

16:22.405 --> 16:24.340
Well, uh...

16:24.407 --> 16:26.275
the one place the cameras can't
see is right here in our backyard,

16:26.343 --> 16:27.977
so I'm charging people
to do whatever they want.

16:28.044 --> 16:29.979
Isn't that wonderful?

16:30.046 --> 16:32.114
I don't see what's so wonderful.

16:32.182 --> 16:35.584
Remember how you wanted me to
get that expensive operation?

16:35.652 --> 16:38.120
Well, now I can
afford a motorcycle!

16:38.188 --> 16:41.557
Ever hear of the expression
"Not in my backyard"?

16:41.625 --> 16:43.492
Well... that!

16:44.828 --> 16:46.262
Nothin'.

16:46.329 --> 16:47.963
Nothin'. Somethin'.

16:48.031 --> 16:49.765
I don't want to get
Homer in trouble,

16:49.833 --> 16:52.635
but it's just plain wrong
to use that blind spot

16:52.702 --> 16:55.871
to turn our backyard into
a Mecca of misdemeanors!

16:55.939 --> 16:57.172
Blind spot?!

16:57.240 --> 16:58.741
Mecca?!

17:02.178 --> 17:04.813
Rod, hold up Daddy's shaving
mirror out the window, would ya?

17:10.954 --> 17:12.855
I see you now.

17:12.923 --> 17:14.522
Rod, you and Todd
stay in the house.

17:14.590 --> 17:16.358
Todd's not in the house.

17:18.994 --> 17:20.061
No!

17:23.351 --> 17:26.586
And that's why school uniforms
should not be mandatory.

17:26.654 --> 17:27.988
Lisa, rebuttal?

17:33.094 --> 17:35.829
Dressing in uniforms
is a good thing.

17:35.897 --> 17:39.633
If everyone looks the same,
it levels the playing field.

17:39.700 --> 17:41.268
Hmm, very smart.

17:41.335 --> 17:43.270
That's well-reasoned.
A true brunette.

17:43.337 --> 17:46.072
It's better to just
fit in with the crowd.

17:46.140 --> 17:47.541
She's as bright as her
hair is dark! So smart!

17:47.608 --> 17:48.575
Great point!

17:48.643 --> 17:50.176
Oh, I can't go on!

17:50.244 --> 17:51.811
This rebuttal is a sham!

17:52.713 --> 17:53.847
You aren't being persuaded

17:53.915 --> 17:55.315
by the content of my argument.

17:55.383 --> 17:57.717
You're being convinced
by the color of my hair!

17:57.785 --> 17:59.252
Well, that--
that's absurd! Ridiculous!

17:59.320 --> 18:01.421
Although her brown hair
makes a persuasive case.

18:01.489 --> 18:03.323
Well guess what?
I am not a brunette!

18:03.391 --> 18:05.091
I'm a blonde!

18:06.294 --> 18:07.327
Roots!

18:08.796 --> 18:11.631
We must rid ourselves of
these outdated clichés.

18:11.699 --> 18:13.466
Not all blondes are dumb!

18:13.534 --> 18:16.036
Not all fat people are jolly.

18:16.103 --> 18:17.771
Would you be jolly

18:17.838 --> 18:20.440
if you thought Comic-Con
was moving to Anaheim?

18:20.508 --> 18:23.343
And not all old people
are bad drivers.

18:24.812 --> 18:27.180
This building cut me off!

18:38.125 --> 18:39.659
Who wants feet steak?

18:39.727 --> 18:40.860
Me! Me!

18:40.928 --> 18:42.295
Over here!

18:42.363 --> 18:44.931
De-meat those feet!

18:44.999 --> 18:47.100
Oh, no! I don't have
to listen to you.

18:47.168 --> 18:49.703
If I'm not on camera,
you can't see me!

18:49.770 --> 18:51.538
I'm standin' right here!

18:51.606 --> 18:53.473
Everyone in this town
is sick and tired

18:53.541 --> 18:55.041
of you looking over their shoulder.

18:55.109 --> 18:57.243
"Don't leave your
sprinklers on in the rain!

18:57.311 --> 18:59.779
Don't burn that pile of
ventriloquist dummies!"

18:59.847 --> 19:01.448
Oh, but you promised!

19:01.515 --> 19:02.782
Later. Later.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.951
But, neighbor,
why did you have to do this?

19:05.019 --> 19:07.821
I've tattled this
town into a paradise!

19:11.559 --> 19:15.095
This used to be just
a little part of me.

19:15.162 --> 19:17.097
You see, Ned, your citywide nagging

19:17.164 --> 19:18.999
compressed all of our
town's misbehavior

19:19.066 --> 19:21.635
into one small place.

19:21.702 --> 19:24.971
Creating a glittering
diamond of super evil.

19:26.107 --> 19:27.574
I guess I did create this.

19:27.642 --> 19:29.042
Like God created the devil.

19:29.110 --> 19:30.710
God created the devil?

19:30.778 --> 19:32.479
Finally, He did something cool.

19:33.881 --> 19:36.082
Oh, I never wanted to
turn into Big Brother.

19:36.150 --> 19:37.684
I just wanted to be little sister,

19:37.752 --> 19:40.787
tattlin' on everyone so the
town would be a nicer place.

19:40.855 --> 19:43.390
Well, if you ask me,
you were trying to play God.

19:44.825 --> 19:47.060
That's the worst sin of all,
for some reason.

19:47.128 --> 19:48.728
What can I do to make things right?

19:48.796 --> 19:51.131
You can help me take
out those cameras.

19:52.433 --> 19:55.769
Neighbor, we got some work to do.

19:57.672 --> 19:59.072
Yes!

20:12.353 --> 20:15.221
So, sadly, the most popular
reality show in England

20:15.289 --> 20:16.690
is no more.

20:18.626 --> 20:20.560
I'll miss that Ralph Wiggum.

20:20.628 --> 20:22.662
Reminds me of my boy.

20:22.730 --> 20:25.732
Oh, Mummy, my cat's breath
smells like cat food.
