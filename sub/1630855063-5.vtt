WEBVTT

01:13.532 --> 01:14.533
Bailey?

01:26.503 --> 01:27.546
Do you know her?

01:32.843 --> 01:33.677
Do you?

01:36.054 --> 01:37.055
<i>No.</i>

01:38.432 --> 01:39.641
We never talk about her.

01:42.394 --> 01:43.687
It's hard to talk about.

01:48.150 --> 01:51.028
When I lost your mother...

01:52.196 --> 01:53.530
everything--

01:55.365 --> 01:56.408
My whole life changed.

01:58.744 --> 02:02.206
But I think about her all the time.

02:03.749 --> 02:07.294
She's who I see whenever I look at you.

02:22.226 --> 02:23.060
Look.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.938
"Debate Team President Katherine Smith
and teammates

02:25.938 --> 02:28.482
celebrate state championship
at her family's bar,

02:28.482 --> 02:29.942
The Never Dry."

02:32.653 --> 02:34.404
You think that bar still exists?

02:35.030 --> 02:36.240
The photo's 20 years old.

02:37.741 --> 02:39.701
It's still here.
It's right off 6th Street.

02:49.294 --> 02:50.295
Let's go.

02:51.213 --> 02:52.840
Come on. We need to go there now.

02:56.260 --> 02:57.094
Bailey.

02:57.845 --> 02:59.596
I know you're upset. I know you are.

02:59.596 --> 03:02.140
I'm upset too
but we need to talk this through.

03:02.140 --> 03:03.433
There's nothing to talk through.

03:03.433 --> 03:06.770
We're 55 names from getting an answer
to who your father used to be.

03:07.729 --> 03:09.940
If we just stay here
and go through the roster--

03:09.940 --> 03:11.441
No, I'm sick of sitting here.

03:12.276 --> 03:13.277
Bailey--

03:13.277 --> 03:15.112
We can google the names at the hotel.

03:15.112 --> 03:18.115
Yeah. Most of them are on Google
but the yearbooks are here.

03:18.115 --> 03:20.868
Let me put it this way,
I'm going to The Never Dry.

03:21.660 --> 03:23.579
I need to know who she is.

03:24.496 --> 03:26.874
Please, I'm asking you to come with me.

03:31.128 --> 03:33.297
Okay. Let's go.

03:37.050 --> 03:39.469
<i>Find out if she rented a car,
checked into a hotel,</i>

03:39.469 --> 03:42.723
where she used a credit card
and I want a trace on her phone.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.765
I'll put in for a warrant.

03:43.765 --> 03:45.934
Exigent circumstance.
They teach you anything in law school?

03:45.934 --> 03:47.644
Taught me I can't get a trace
without a warrant.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.521
Want me to send the file on Owen
to the courthouse?

03:49.521 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, I think we want that
in as many hands as possible.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.817
- Right.
- Tell the judge Hannah Hall and her ward

03:53.817 --> 03:55.485
are in imminent danger.

03:55.485 --> 03:57.154
We gotta get to them
by the end of the day.

03:57.154 --> 03:59.239
Tell her we gotta find them
before anyone else does.

04:01.116 --> 04:03.452
- What happened to knocking?
- Bailey Michaels is in Austin.

04:04.494 --> 04:05.329
Since when?

04:05.329 --> 04:07.873
She and Hannah Hall took a flight
from San Francisco yesterday.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.208
Shit.

04:09.208 --> 04:11.793
If anything happens to them--
If this story surfaces again--

04:11.793 --> 04:12.878
I got it.

04:13.420 --> 04:14.588
Where do you wanna start?

04:14.588 --> 04:17.007
- I wanna trace her phone, and I think--
- With a warrant.

04:17.632 --> 04:20.928
And I think someone should make it clear
to the FBI team investigating The Shop

04:20.928 --> 04:23.472
that putting any photos of Owen
in the papers or on the news

04:23.472 --> 04:25.682
would be a colossally stupid idea.

04:28.519 --> 04:32.606
I've got a contact pretty high up
in the criminal division at the DOJ.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.192
- See if she can run some interference.
- Thank you.

04:35.817 --> 04:36.818
Hey.

04:37.653 --> 04:39.112
- Do they know?
- Excuse me?

04:39.112 --> 04:41.323
- <i>Hey, Maris.</i>
- Hold on just one second.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.784
Why are they here? Do they know?

04:45.661 --> 04:46.828
No. I don't think--

04:47.829 --> 04:48.914
They can't.

04:49.998 --> 04:52.000
Then what the fuck
are they doing in Austin?

05:02.219 --> 05:04.972
There are hundreds
of Katherine Smiths on Instagram.

05:04.972 --> 05:06.473
- Literally hundreds...
- Yeah.

05:06.473 --> 05:08.517
...but none of them look like her.

05:11.228 --> 05:12.229
Anything on the bar?

05:12.229 --> 05:15.274
Some Yelp reviews,
blog posts on Eater, an old profile.

05:15.274 --> 05:17.109
I mean, it hasn't been updated in a while.

05:17.609 --> 05:19.528
Does anyone even use that anymore?

05:20.445 --> 05:21.446
Watch it.

05:22.406 --> 05:23.699
Seriously, I was asking.

05:24.658 --> 05:26.451
Well, I'm telling you some of us do.

05:27.911 --> 05:30.038
Including Charlie Smith.

05:33.375 --> 05:35.085
- He's not Dad.
- No, he's not.

05:36.879 --> 05:38.630
Lists Austin at his hometown.

05:38.630 --> 05:42.176
He studied architecture
at the University of Texas at Austin.

05:43.427 --> 05:46.305
Is there anything on his wife,
Andrea something?

05:46.305 --> 05:48.849
Reyes. Andrea Reyes.

05:48.849 --> 05:50.392
But it says he's single.

05:51.185 --> 05:52.811
R-E-Y-E-S, right?

05:52.811 --> 05:53.896
I think so.

06:10.204 --> 06:12.539
Bailey, do you know her?

06:15.125 --> 06:16.710
Maybe. I--

06:17.419 --> 06:18.670
I'm not sure.

06:42.277 --> 06:43.278
Thanks.

06:47.533 --> 06:49.076
Does it look familiar?

06:49.076 --> 06:50.494
I don't know. Maybe a little.

06:51.995 --> 06:53.830
Maybe I'll remember more inside.

06:53.830 --> 06:55.123
- Wait.
- What?

06:55.123 --> 06:56.792
- I don't want you in there.
- Why not?

06:57.292 --> 07:00.045
We don't know whose bar this is.
We don't know who these people are.

07:00.045 --> 07:01.755
We don't know whether they're dangerous.

07:01.755 --> 07:04.132
All we know is that it's looking like
you have roots here.

07:04.132 --> 07:06.009
Roots your father
didn't want you to know about.

07:06.009 --> 07:09.179
Something or someone
he was trying to protect you from.

07:11.723 --> 07:15.394
Go get some coffee.
Just work on Cook's roster

07:15.394 --> 07:17.437
and stay where the barista can see you.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.566
You saw the picture.
She looks just like me.

07:21.483 --> 07:25.779
Why won't you just say it?
Say who you think is inside.

07:28.740 --> 07:31.451
Probably for the same reason
you're not ready to say it either.

08:19.833 --> 08:20.834
Hello?

08:38.977 --> 08:42.397
<i>You're a little vague
when you talk to her about Olivia.</i>

08:42.981 --> 08:44.733
A little vague when I bring her up too.

08:51.073 --> 08:52.074
Hey there.

08:54.034 --> 08:55.661
We're not open just yet.

08:55.661 --> 08:57.496
We usually don't start serving till 5:00.

08:58.288 --> 08:59.498
Sorry about that.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.375
The door was unlocked and I just--

09:02.167 --> 09:03.794
I didn't mean to let myself in.

09:05.087 --> 09:06.463
I guess it's five o'clock somewhere.

09:09.299 --> 09:11.426
Why don't you take a look
at the cocktail menu?

09:12.094 --> 09:13.804
I got a couple more things
to take care of.

09:20.143 --> 09:21.395
I'm Charlie, by the way.

09:22.104 --> 09:24.022
Maxine. Max.

09:25.524 --> 09:26.567
Pleased to meet you, Max.

09:30.571 --> 09:31.780
You okay over there?

09:33.282 --> 09:35.534
Sorry. Nervous tic.

09:36.660 --> 09:37.703
What you nervous about?

09:39.538 --> 09:41.373
New city, you know?

09:42.875 --> 09:45.627
And I have an interview tomorrow
at the university.

09:45.627 --> 09:47.129
I'm staying around the corner.

09:47.129 --> 09:49.673
How is the walk to campus from here?
Doable?

09:51.216 --> 09:53.260
I mean, it's a good 45 minutes.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.928
And in this heat,

09:55.429 --> 09:57.431
it's probably not the best look
for your interview.

09:57.431 --> 09:58.557
Right. Good point.

09:59.433 --> 10:00.475
What's the job?

10:01.560 --> 10:04.396
It's a teaching position
at the school of architecture.

10:05.814 --> 10:06.815
Really?

10:09.151 --> 10:11.653
I took some classes over there
once upon a time.

10:11.653 --> 10:13.155
Yeah, I started my master's.

10:14.823 --> 10:17.910
Well, a couple curveballs, and here I am.

10:18.869 --> 10:21.288
Yeah, I know a little about curveballs.

10:24.333 --> 10:25.334
So, you're an architect?

10:28.378 --> 10:30.631
I'm in the running for a visiting position

10:30.631 --> 10:33.050
but they asked me to have dinner
with some of the faculty tonight,

10:33.050 --> 10:35.302
so I'm hopeful and a little nervous.

10:35.844 --> 10:39.181
Well, you've come to the right place.
First drink's on the house.

10:54.404 --> 10:56.198
Hook 'em horns, baby!

11:03.664 --> 11:06.291
- Hey.
- This photo you sent is insane.

11:06.875 --> 11:08.168
<i>Yeah. It's a lot.</i>

11:10.379 --> 11:11.880
You found it in the library?

11:11.880 --> 11:13.382
<i>In an old yearbook.</i>

11:13.966 --> 11:14.967
<i>You okay?</i>

11:15.634 --> 11:17.261
Yeah. I don't know.

11:17.886 --> 11:19.137
What do you think?

11:19.137 --> 11:21.348
<i>I mean, clearly there's a resemblance.</i>

11:22.724 --> 11:25.018
Okay. And?

11:25.018 --> 11:28.814
<i>And maybe she's, like,
your aunt or a cousin</i>

11:28.814 --> 11:29.982
or something. I just--

11:31.692 --> 11:33.861
I don't think your dad would lie to you
about who your mom was.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.112
I really don't, Bailey.

11:37.072 --> 11:40.450
Yeah. Well, three days ago, I didn't think
he'd lie to me about anything but...

11:41.076 --> 11:42.327
<i>Come on, Bails.</i>

11:44.037 --> 11:45.747
He'd never keep your mom from you.

11:49.793 --> 11:51.837
So why can't I breathe when I look at her?

12:00.596 --> 12:01.889
The house specialty.

12:01.889 --> 12:04.975
My grandfather used to make the bitters
himself, now I do it.

12:05.809 --> 12:06.810
Most of the time anyway.

12:11.440 --> 12:12.441
Wow.

12:13.942 --> 12:15.777
So, this is your family's bar?

12:15.777 --> 12:17.905
Yeah.
My grandfather was the original owner.

12:22.618 --> 12:25.913
He wanted a place to hang out
and play cards with his buddies.

12:25.913 --> 12:27.497
Wow. That's cool.

12:29.541 --> 12:30.584
What about your father?

12:32.127 --> 12:32.961
What about him?

12:35.547 --> 12:37.674
I was just wondering
if he works here too or...

12:39.009 --> 12:40.093
My father's a lawyer.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.679
Yeah, this was never his thing.

12:45.057 --> 12:47.559
To be honest, it was never mine either,

12:47.559 --> 12:49.811
but at a certain point I needed the gig.

12:49.811 --> 12:50.729
Curveballs.

12:50.729 --> 12:51.855
Yeah. Two of 'em.

12:52.606 --> 12:53.649
Twins.

12:55.067 --> 12:57.361
Anyway, that was the end of my master's.

13:01.406 --> 13:04.326
Maybe that's why you look familiar.

13:08.080 --> 13:11.416
I think I might have been here,
at this bar.

13:13.502 --> 13:14.503
Really?

13:15.462 --> 13:17.339
I thought you said you were new to Austin.

13:18.257 --> 13:19.716
I am. That's the thing.

13:20.801 --> 13:22.386
I've only been here one other time.

13:23.262 --> 13:28.600
A few years ago I came to town with a
girlfriend for the hot sauce competition.

13:28.600 --> 13:31.895
She was taking pictures for the paper
that she worked for.

13:33.355 --> 13:35.232
We hit a bunch of bars.

13:35.232 --> 13:38.151
But I think we might have been here.

13:38.151 --> 13:40.362
It just feels really familiar.

13:41.071 --> 13:42.072
Yeah, it's possible.

13:43.240 --> 13:45.742
The festival's held,
down at Fiesta Gardens.

13:45.742 --> 13:47.327
That's not too far from here.

13:47.327 --> 13:49.162
We keep some of the winners in stock.

13:51.540 --> 13:54.793
Yeah. This one makes a mean Bloody Mary.

13:55.294 --> 13:56.295
I'll bet.

13:58.213 --> 14:02.092
If I'm remembering right, the bartender
working that night was a total sweetheart.

14:02.092 --> 14:05.596
She gave us all sorts of tips
for places to eat.

14:05.596 --> 14:07.598
She had long blond hair.

14:08.348 --> 14:10.392
She looked a lot like you actually.

14:11.518 --> 14:12.853
That's some memory you have.

14:14.229 --> 14:15.981
Well, I might be getting some help.

14:16.565 --> 14:18.358
Maybe it was her.

14:25.824 --> 14:26.825
Not possible.

14:29.870 --> 14:30.871
Are you guys related?

14:30.871 --> 14:32.080
You ask a lot of questions.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.834
I know. Sorry.

14:36.877 --> 14:37.878
It is a bad habit.

14:38.629 --> 14:40.047
Asking too many questions?

14:40.047 --> 14:41.507
Thinking people wanna answer.

14:45.844 --> 14:47.095
No, it's fine.

14:48.472 --> 14:50.807
She was my sister and it's just...

14:51.892 --> 14:53.101
she's no longer with us.

14:54.520 --> 14:55.729
Car accident a while back.

15:02.236 --> 15:03.570
I'm so sorry.

15:05.030 --> 15:06.031
Yeah.

15:08.033 --> 15:09.034
Me too.

15:11.078 --> 15:14.748
<i>Yes. We have an update on
the fraud investigation at The Shop.</i>

15:14.748 --> 15:18.919
<i>According to my sources, several more
of The Shop's officers and senior staff</i>

15:18.919 --> 15:21.338
<i>are expected to be indicted
this afternoon.</i>

15:21.338 --> 15:23.507
Shit. Okay, everybody.

15:23.507 --> 15:25.384
Where are we on Hannah Hall's cell phone?

15:25.384 --> 15:26.885
The warrant application's in.

15:26.885 --> 15:29.763
- Did you follow up with the judge?
- She's been on the bench all day.

15:29.763 --> 15:30.848
Hey.

15:31.765 --> 15:32.808
- You see this?
- Yeah.

15:33.809 --> 15:35.644
You get anywhere with your friend
at the DOJ?

15:35.644 --> 15:37.020
Said her hands are tied.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.439
- Where are we with the phone warrant?
- Nowhere.

15:41.149 --> 15:42.359
Let me call the data brokers.

15:42.943 --> 15:44.069
Let me track Hannah's phone.

15:44.653 --> 15:47.281
Maris, you don't have to know about it.
This is me going rogue.

15:49.908 --> 15:51.368
Officially, it's a no.

15:52.035 --> 15:53.829
Thanks, unofficially.

15:55.247 --> 15:57.207
- New plan?
- Yeah. Call the data brokers.

15:57.207 --> 15:59.209
- CSLI for the last 24 hours.
- On it.

16:00.794 --> 16:01.795
This just came for you.

16:03.338 --> 16:04.339
Thank you.

16:30.115 --> 16:31.491
The fuck?

17:01.688 --> 17:03.690
Hey. Excuse me. Do you have a--

17:04.191 --> 17:05.192
Thanks.

17:06.318 --> 17:07.277
Sorry. One sec.

17:07.986 --> 17:10.030
Hey. My phone's literally about to die.

17:10.030 --> 17:11.573
I think I found an address.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.784
- <i>Whose address?</i>
- Andrea Reyes.

17:13.784 --> 17:14.910
<i>Seriously?</i>

17:15.661 --> 17:17.079
Are you sure it's the same Andrea?

17:17.079 --> 17:19.957
No, but I found the same address
for Charles Smith

17:19.957 --> 17:22.459
on a campaign contribution
disclosure form, so...

17:23.961 --> 17:26.588
Okay. Well, can you send it to me?

17:27.089 --> 17:28.089
<i>Just did.</i>

17:34.680 --> 17:36.139
It's actually pretty close.

17:36.849 --> 17:38.892
Bailey, you can't go by yourself.

17:39.935 --> 17:42.563
I can't believe I'm saying this,
but you should probably wait for Hannah.

17:44.064 --> 17:46.316
Yeah, maybe.

17:46.316 --> 17:47.776
<i>Is she still in the bar?</i>

17:49.194 --> 17:50.445
She is.

17:55.409 --> 17:56.535
Thanks for the drink.

17:58.203 --> 17:59.288
Are you sure I can't...

18:00.414 --> 18:02.291
On the house means on the house.

18:04.585 --> 18:06.170
Your boys sure are adorable.

18:08.463 --> 18:12.384
Yeah, they're a bit older than
they were there, so a bit less adorable.

18:12.885 --> 18:13.719
You got kids?

18:13.719 --> 18:15.846
Not yet. I'm still looking for the guy.

18:19.349 --> 18:21.935
Anyway, I should get going.

18:23.020 --> 18:26.773
But maybe I'll head back
if I get done early enough.

18:27.399 --> 18:28.317
Definitely.

18:28.317 --> 18:30.068
Yeah, come back. We'll celebrate.

18:30.652 --> 18:31.653
From your lips.

18:34.198 --> 18:37.075
I do have one more bizarre question
before I go.

18:38.243 --> 18:39.453
Of course you do.

18:41.663 --> 18:43.498
I figure you know a lot of locals.

18:44.208 --> 18:46.126
Far too many. Why?

18:47.211 --> 18:48.545
I'm trying to find a guy.

18:49.505 --> 18:51.673
My girlfriend and I
met him when we were here.

18:51.673 --> 18:55.093
He lived in Austin, probably still does.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.803
I mean, he might've been a regular.

18:57.888 --> 19:00.098
And my girlfriend had a huge crush on him.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.684
Okay?

19:03.185 --> 19:07.272
Anyway, she's going through a crappy
divorce and I know this is ridiculous,

19:07.272 --> 19:12.486
but since I'm in town, I thought maybe
I'd try to find him for her.

19:13.570 --> 19:14.696
They had a connection.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.407
How long ago was this?

19:18.200 --> 19:19.201
A while ago.

19:20.786 --> 19:22.162
Connections are hard to find.

19:24.706 --> 19:25.707
Fair enough.

19:27.042 --> 19:30.170
You got a name?
Not that I'm great with names but...

19:31.046 --> 19:34.174
How about with faces?
I think I took a photo that day.

19:34.174 --> 19:35.592
Yeah, I'm pretty good with faces.

19:47.437 --> 19:48.438
Where did you get this?

19:50.274 --> 19:51.275
You think this is funny?

19:51.275 --> 19:53.151
This is my family you're fucking with.

19:54.278 --> 19:57.072
Who are you? Who sent you?

19:57.072 --> 19:57.990
No one.

19:57.990 --> 19:59.116
Tell me who sent you!

19:59.116 --> 20:00.617
Hey! Get off of her!

20:04.246 --> 20:05.789
Holy shit.

20:07.082 --> 20:07.916
Kristin?

20:07.916 --> 20:10.752
No, I'm not.

20:12.004 --> 20:14.381
Go, now!

20:16.884 --> 20:19.469
- What happened? Who was that?
- Just keep going.

20:30.981 --> 20:31.982
- Hey!
- Excuse me.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.401
Watch it!

20:58.967 --> 21:00.802
Just go!

21:01.887 --> 21:03.222
Watch it!

21:35.462 --> 21:36.463
Bailey, faster.

21:36.463 --> 21:38.799
I'm going as fast as I can.
It's a shit show.

21:38.799 --> 21:40.300
Is he even following us anymore?

21:41.260 --> 21:42.219
Bailey.

21:43.804 --> 21:45.597
Come on. We gotta go.

21:48.600 --> 21:50.102
<i>Kristie.</i>

21:54.815 --> 21:56.483
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

21:57.568 --> 21:59.403
<i>You're not afraid of bats, are you?</i>

22:02.656 --> 22:06.201
<i>Don't worry.
They're just... passing through.</i>

22:16.879 --> 22:19.256
<i>Kristie.</i>

22:19.256 --> 22:20.174
Bailey?

22:23.969 --> 22:24.970
You okay?

22:33.478 --> 22:34.730
I remember her.

22:36.732 --> 22:42.154
She was here with Dad
and Andrea and Charlie.

22:45.073 --> 22:46.283
He called me Kristie.

22:47.492 --> 22:48.952
My dad called me Kristie.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.496
I mean...

22:54.082 --> 22:56.251
she's my mother. Isn't she?

22:57.753 --> 22:58.754
I think, maybe.

23:01.381 --> 23:02.674
Do you think that--

23:03.967 --> 23:05.177
I mean, if--

23:05.177 --> 23:07.346
If my dad lied about who she was,

23:07.346 --> 23:10.933
then do you think that
maybe she might still be--

23:10.933 --> 23:12.809
She died in a car accident.

23:13.977 --> 23:16.688
Charlie told me. That part's true.

23:16.688 --> 23:18.607
Your dad didn't lie about that.

23:20.067 --> 23:21.527
I am so sorry.

23:25.739 --> 23:28.367
Why? Why would he...

23:29.993 --> 23:32.329
I don't know. I really don't.

23:43.966 --> 23:45.425
Bailey, listen to me.

23:46.426 --> 23:51.557
I'm upset too but we need to go.
We need to go someplace safe.

23:53.016 --> 23:54.309
Can we do that?

23:55.060 --> 23:58.063
And then we will talk this all through,
I promise. I promise you that.

23:59.273 --> 24:01.233
- Can we go?
- Yeah, okay.

24:03.318 --> 24:04.570
Come on.

24:23.380 --> 24:25.674
You know that doesn't actually
make it come any faster.

24:25.674 --> 24:28.468
- Maybe we should take the stairs.
- We're on the sixth floor.

24:29.720 --> 24:30.762
Oh, come on.

24:56.705 --> 24:57.998
We're taking the stairs.

25:01.793 --> 25:04.755
But until then, we've got to
go back, because if anything--

25:06.173 --> 25:07.174
Guys, hold on a sec.

25:07.674 --> 25:09.426
- What?
- Owen sent me his phone.

25:11.011 --> 25:12.221
Notes app, emails.

25:13.055 --> 25:14.056
All of it annotated.

25:16.266 --> 25:18.018
Yeah, we're gonna have to push.

25:19.811 --> 25:21.939
Look, I just started digging in
but it's exculpatory.

25:21.939 --> 25:24.691
He wasn't part of the primary coding team
but he was trying to fix the problem.

25:24.691 --> 25:28.153
He was pushing Avett not to go public,
to declare there was an issue.

25:31.031 --> 25:34.201
Jackie, get me the US Attorney's office
in San Francisco.

25:34.201 --> 25:36.078
Who's running point on the investigation?

25:36.078 --> 25:38.038
Jamie Caldera is the AUSA on the case.

25:38.038 --> 25:40.123
And I've been talking to Naomi Wu
at the FBI.

25:40.123 --> 25:41.834
Get her on the phone for me.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.752
We got Hannah Hall's CSLI records,

25:43.752 --> 25:45.879
looks like she just walked into
The Town Hotel.

25:48.006 --> 25:49.091
Go.

25:49.091 --> 25:51.051
I'll text you Naomi Wu's contact info.

25:51.635 --> 25:53.178
Grab Poser, meet us in the garage.

25:53.178 --> 25:55.138
Larry, grab your gear. You're with me.

25:55.138 --> 25:56.265
I gotta go.

26:07.067 --> 26:08.277
Let's pack up.

26:13.282 --> 26:14.366
Hey, Bailey!

26:15.033 --> 26:16.410
Where are we going?

26:16.410 --> 26:17.494
Home.

26:18.287 --> 26:19.538
I can't just leave.

26:20.163 --> 26:21.164
Bailey.

26:23.959 --> 26:25.961
But you said we'd talk it through.

26:27.045 --> 26:30.007
I said we'd talk it through
once we got somewhere safe.

26:30.007 --> 26:31.300
You've got to be kidding me.

26:31.300 --> 26:34.970
I mean, he lied to me.
He lied to me about everything.

26:34.970 --> 26:37.598
About who I am,
who my family is, all of it.

26:37.598 --> 26:41.143
And then he fucking disappeared
and I wanna know the truth! Don't you?

26:41.143 --> 26:44.897
Yes. I'm telling you, we'll find it.
Just not here.

26:44.897 --> 26:47.357
This is where the answers are.
Maybe, we should--

26:47.357 --> 26:50.110
We should go back to The Never Dry
and talk to Charlie.

26:50.110 --> 26:51.612
Forget it. No!

26:52.821 --> 26:56.241
I may not know why your father
did what he did, but I know who he is.

26:56.742 --> 26:59.286
And anyone who would
have that kind of reaction to him

26:59.286 --> 27:00.871
is not someone we can trust.

27:02.623 --> 27:03.624
Pl--

27:04.499 --> 27:05.918
We're so close.

27:06.877 --> 27:10.214
I promise we will figure it out,
but not here.

27:11.340 --> 27:12.799
Not where you might be in danger.

28:05.102 --> 28:06.186
How does it feel?

28:06.770 --> 28:07.771
Pretty great.

28:09.690 --> 28:11.483
If you don't like the ring, just--

28:11.483 --> 28:12.568
I love the ring.

28:13.569 --> 28:14.570
I love you.

28:16.154 --> 28:17.155
But?

28:19.533 --> 28:20.993
How did Bailey take it?

28:24.288 --> 28:26.290
She was so hap-- No.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.417
About how you'd expect.

28:28.417 --> 28:29.501
That bad?

28:30.085 --> 28:31.086
She'll be fine.

28:35.757 --> 28:37.384
You don't know that. I mean...

28:39.178 --> 28:40.804
growing up without a mom.

28:42.973 --> 28:44.474
It's hard to let in someone new.

28:46.643 --> 28:47.853
Especially when...

28:50.856 --> 28:53.942
you're a little vague
when you talk to her about Olivia.

28:56.904 --> 28:59.448
You really wanna get into all this
tonight?

29:00.574 --> 29:02.618
And a little vague
when I bring her up too.

29:10.667 --> 29:12.127
There are some things I'm just...

29:14.671 --> 29:16.715
afraid to tell her about her mom.

29:19.343 --> 29:20.344
Like what?

29:21.595 --> 29:22.596
Like...

29:28.977 --> 29:32.981
Like, you could never tell either of them
what to do.

29:35.317 --> 29:36.693
This is gonna go well.

29:36.693 --> 29:37.986
Probably not.

29:37.986 --> 29:39.363
Comforting.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.243
We can wait till she graduates
high school, if that's what you want.

29:45.911 --> 29:47.538
What do you want?

29:48.497 --> 29:49.498
You.

29:50.332 --> 29:53.418
And if I were even slightly worried
about it the rest of it,

29:53.418 --> 29:55.045
I wouldn't be okay standing here.

29:56.004 --> 29:57.172
And for the record...

29:58.757 --> 30:01.593
I'm pretty fucking okay
to be standing here.

30:30.956 --> 30:32.165
Hey, Jules.

30:32.165 --> 30:35.794
- <i>Owen's real name is Ethan Young.</i>
- What?

30:35.794 --> 30:38.213
You were right. We found a safe
in your grandfather's vase.

30:38.213 --> 30:42.176
The key opened the safe and inside was
a handwritten will for an Owen Michaels,

30:42.176 --> 30:43.427
née Ethan Young.

30:43.427 --> 30:44.845
Slow down. You have his will?

30:44.845 --> 30:47.723
You need to get out of Austin, Hannah.
You need to get out of there now.

30:47.723 --> 30:49.141
Why? What is going on?

30:49.141 --> 30:51.101
<i>Have you heard of a Nicholas Bell?</i>

30:51.101 --> 30:52.644
The name sounds familiar, but--

30:52.644 --> 30:55.397
He's Kate Smith's father,
Owen's father-in-law.

30:57.149 --> 31:00.569
He's a mob lawyer, Hannah,
for the Campano family.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.071
<i>They're the largest crime syndicate
in North America.</i>

31:03.071 --> 31:05.616
<i>We're talking racketeering,
extortion, murder.</i>

31:05.616 --> 31:09.536
<i>Not to mention
a serious foothold in Oxy trafficking.</i>

31:10.454 --> 31:11.830
What does it have to do with Owen?

31:11.830 --> 31:14.541
<i>Owen turned state's evidence
against the Campanos</i>

31:14.541 --> 31:15.959
<i>after Kate was killed.</i>

31:15.959 --> 31:19.129
He took down Nicholas Bell
and other key members of the organization.

31:19.129 --> 31:20.297
Oh, my God.

31:20.297 --> 31:23.342
Yeah.
You need to get the fuck out of there!

31:25.135 --> 31:27.095
Han, listen to me.
I spoke to the Hertz office.

31:27.095 --> 31:28.555
It's in your hotel, all right?

31:28.555 --> 31:31.934
There's a car waiting for you.
All you need to do is pack up and go.

31:31.934 --> 31:33.685
<i>And make sure
not to leave anything that they can</i>

31:33.685 --> 31:35.354
- <i>trace back to you or Bailey.</i>
- Right.

31:35.354 --> 31:37.147
<i>I'm gonna fly to Albuquerque
in the morning.</i>

31:37.147 --> 31:38.815
<i>I'll meet you there,
we'll drive back together.</i>

31:38.815 --> 31:39.816
Yeah.

31:39.816 --> 31:42.736
<i>And get rid of your phones,
you can get new ones on the road.</i>

31:42.736 --> 31:43.862
Yeah.

31:43.862 --> 31:45.197
<i>Now, Hannah!</i>

32:02.756 --> 32:03.757
Bailey?

32:04.675 --> 32:06.552
Bailey, we gotta get outta here.

32:08.011 --> 32:10.472
We gotta go. Bailey.

32:13.475 --> 32:14.601
Fuck!

32:16.270 --> 32:17.396
Bailey?

32:27.447 --> 32:30.659
Have you seen a teenage girl?
Sixteen, blond, pink streaks.

32:30.659 --> 32:32.619
I just got here. I don't...

33:17.080 --> 33:18.290
With the Marshals service.

33:18.290 --> 33:20.250
I'm looking for a room number
for a Hannah Hall.

33:21.627 --> 33:24.338
- I'm sorry, I'm just not...
- Ma'am, it's kinda urgent.

33:24.338 --> 33:27.883
She's about 5'8'', she's got brown hair,
white Caucasian, mid-to-late 40s.

33:27.883 --> 33:29.301
Might've paid in cash.

33:33.305 --> 33:34.932
Could be Miss Parnes.

33:39.311 --> 33:40.312
Hang back.

33:45.901 --> 33:46.902
Bailey?

33:51.031 --> 33:52.366
What did you do, Hannah?

34:15.973 --> 34:17.056
<i>Hey, kiddo.</i>

34:17.056 --> 34:19.434
Hey. I swear to God, I just saw Kristin.

34:20.018 --> 34:21.395
<i>Kristin? What?</i>

34:23.813 --> 34:26.190
I want men at the hotel
and at The Never Dry.

34:27.568 --> 34:29.527
