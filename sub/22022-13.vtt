how much is that?

- Definitely.

Because if the te...

Kepner didn't believe

to let us try this

01:37.867 --> 01:39.773
Who's Kepner to judge?

being the judge.

Come here. Hello.

02:01.833 --> 02:04.172
Hey, I just wanted to say "hi"
before I had to go to work.

02:04.240 --> 02:06.637
Come here, ladybug.
Oh!

02:06.832 --> 02:08.752
- What is, uh, all this?
- Hello.

02:08.835 --> 02:10.414
- Are you sick?
- Oh, I'm just a little

02:10.483 --> 02:11.546
ung-hay over-ay.

02:11.623 --> 02:13.922
Partied a bit too hard
last night, so...

- Yes, yes, yes.

02:19.790 --> 02:21.709
- All right.
- How are you, my ladybug?

02:21.779 --> 02:23.000
You're so squishy.

02:23.086 --> 02:24.172
You smell like soap.

02:24.240 --> 02:25.283
Yum.

02:25.367 --> 02:26.742
Okay, sweetheart.

02:26.819 --> 02:28.088
Bye, Daddy.

02:28.156 --> 02:30.039
- I'll see you later.
- Say "bye-bye."

02:31.350 --> 02:32.499

02:32.672 --> 02:34.805
Hi.
Hi.

02:43.225 --> 02:44.278
That is very cool.

Oh, uh,
good morning, Chief.

02:47.078 --> 02:48.662
Uh, I-I didn't see your car
in the lot.

02:48.739 --> 02:50.126

02:50.203 --> 02:52.080

02:53.507 --> 02:55.206
No, I'm...

02:55.429 --> 02:58.320
finding a way to fit exercise
into my day.

02:58.437 --> 03:01.336
It is 2,004 steps
to the train.

03:01.413 --> 03:02.789
If I'd done this
a year ago,

03:02.857 --> 03:04.750
maybe I'd have never
had a heart attack.

03:05.034 --> 03:07.157
But you're gonna
take it easy today?

03:07.234 --> 03:10.133
Not at all.
I've been trapped in my bed.

03:10.445 --> 03:12.932
I've binged every
reality show ever made,

03:13.000 --> 03:14.775
and I can physically feel
my IQ lowering.

03:14.843 --> 03:16.702
I'm getting back
in the OR.

03:17.061 --> 03:18.218
Pierce cleared me.

03:18.454 --> 03:19.675
I did.

03:19.743 --> 03:21.523
She's cleared.
I cleared her.

03:23.611 --> 03:25.695
She's cleared,
and I'm not taking it back

03:25.763 --> 03:27.089

you stare at me.

03:27.156 --> 03:28.126
I had things to do today.

03:28.203 --> 03:29.818
Now I've got to spend my day
following her.

03:29.886 --> 03:32.427
Or you could just trust
my professional assessment.

03:34.213 --> 03:35.213
No?

03:36.583 --> 03:38.054
Okay.

so I know you both know.

this morning

03:43.828 --> 03:45.726
to discuss the patent
on his cross-polymer.

03:45.794 --> 03:47.651
They're calling on my phone,
which is fully charged

03:47.718 --> 03:48.976
and on the loudest ring
possible.

03:49.043 --> 03:50.649
And no matter where you are
or what you're doing

03:50.716 --> 03:52.515
when the call comes in,
we find you.

03:52.610 --> 03:54.557
And what are you
not going to do?

03:54.625 --> 03:55.945
Not find you.

03:56.013 --> 03:57.150
Or?

03:57.218 --> 03:58.552
- Mention this to Kepner.
- Mention this to Kepner.

03:58.619 --> 03:59.705
Correct.

03:59.773 --> 04:01.166

04:01.243 --> 04:02.500

Warren?

04:08.769 --> 04:10.692

blunt abdominal trauma

04:10.769 --> 04:12.488

in his upper thigh.

04:12.555 --> 04:13.608

from a scalp lac.

of consciousness.

04:25.935 --> 04:27.535
I was just trying
to teach him chemistry.

04:27.605 --> 04:28.756
Can you tell my mom?

04:28.824 --> 04:30.186
That I wasn't doing
anything wrong?

04:30.254 --> 04:31.551
- Okay, I got him.
- Trauma one?

04:31.668 --> 04:33.345
Yeah. No, Kepner,
you and Grey,

04:33.451 --> 04:34.852

the other rig.

04:34.920 --> 04:36.572

got thrown by the blast.

04:36.639 --> 04:37.720
He was bleeding out
from the abdomen,

04:37.787 --> 04:38.860
and, well,
one of our team,

04:38.928 --> 04:40.662
she just shoved her hand
in there.

04:46.865 --> 04:48.594
Uh, 10-year-old male
with a penetrating...

04:48.662 --> 04:49.844
Why is your hand
inside him?

04:49.912 --> 04:51.577
- Because he was bleeding a lot.
- Take it out of him!

04:51.644 --> 04:53.907
You look 12. Can you find
a grown-up to tell me that?

04:53.975 --> 04:55.080
- Do not move your hand!
- Don't let go!

04:55.147 --> 04:56.524
See that?
Grown-ups.

04:56.592 --> 04:58.029

16:59.233 --> 17:00.374
Okay.

17:00.859 --> 17:03.937
So now... can you feel it
pulsating?

17:05.648 --> 17:08.101
There! I feel it.
I-I clamped it, I think.

17:08.169 --> 17:10.311
- Okay.
- You can take your hand out.

17:12.031 --> 17:13.351
Herrera,
take your hand out.

17:13.439 --> 17:15.009
You told me that if
I took my hand away,

17:15.077 --> 17:16.032
he'd bleed out in seconds.

17:16.101 --> 17:17.305
Yeah, that was before
you clamped him.

17:17.372 --> 17:18.698
Yeah, I don't know
if I clamped it.

17:18.765 --> 17:21.163
- I'm not a doctor.
- Will you just trust me?

17:21.631 --> 17:23.733
Let go of the clamp.

17:24.335 --> 17:25.515
Move!

17:25.583 --> 17:27.912
- Clamp.
- Need some suction.

17:28.351 --> 17:30.152
Great. Bovie.

17:31.364 --> 17:33.193
You did it, Herrera.
He's still alive.

17:34.399 --> 17:36.287
Let's hang two more units.

17:37.533 --> 17:38.952
Sponge stick, Bohkee.

17:39.311 --> 17:43.334
♪♪

17:43.420 --> 17:45.756
Hey, there's scut that's
not gonna do itself, Bello.

17:45.824 --> 17:47.806
And by do itself, I mean,
I'm not gonna do it for you.

17:47.873 --> 17:50.242
Sorry, I'm...
Sorry.

17:50.467 --> 17:52.158
You can page me if you need me,
Dr. Koracick.

17:52.225 --> 17:53.834
Count on it, Dr. Bello.

17:57.505 --> 17:59.282
Geez.
She's hot.

17:59.359 --> 18:01.014
Dancer body. Ass for days.
She single?

18:01.082 --> 18:02.113
Gross.

18:02.190 --> 18:04.035
Um, she's a doctor,

18:04.111 --> 18:05.590
so unless she's
some kind of a savant,

18:05.614 --> 18:06.834
she's of age,
which makes her fair game.

18:06.901 --> 18:08.288
Why so judgy, DeLukes?

18:08.356 --> 18:10.342
Can we just focus
on the project?

18:10.410 --> 18:12.318
There is no project.
There aren't enough variables.

18:12.385 --> 18:14.241
We're talking thermal ablation
of targets

18:14.309 --> 18:15.533
with micromillimeter
precision.

18:15.610 --> 18:17.598
She'll never get there
with just heat versus time.

18:17.666 --> 18:19.957
Why is Shepherd
still barking up that tree?

18:20.025 --> 18:22.694
- I think it's the time frame.
- What time frame?

18:22.762 --> 18:24.327
Rome wasn't built
in a time frame.

18:24.395 --> 18:26.520
- What's the rush?
- Kimmie. Kimmie is the rush.

18:26.588 --> 18:28.221
What in God's name
is a Kimmie?

18:28.289 --> 18:30.715
That.
That's Kimmie.

18:32.618 --> 18:33.958
Oh.

18:36.348 --> 18:38.712
Hmm.

18:39.285 --> 18:41.137
This kid
won't stop bleeding.

18:42.090 --> 18:43.317
Oh, there it is.

18:43.385 --> 18:46.594
Hey, he transected his
superior mesenteric artery.

18:46.662 --> 18:49.262
- Can we fix that?
- We can fix that.

18:49.379 --> 18:52.098
We will do
a reverse saphenous graft.

18:52.207 --> 18:54.493
Oh, that'll take hours.

18:54.570 --> 18:57.019
Why don't you and I
swap out, Bailey?

18:57.152 --> 19:01.378
I'm sure the paperwork's
piled up after your vacation.

19:01.446 --> 19:04.326
Uh, no, I managed
to stay caught up.

19:04.394 --> 19:05.743
I'm fine.

19:05.820 --> 19:07.857
Here, why don't you
harvest the graft

19:07.925 --> 19:08.967
since
you're already there?

19:09.035 --> 19:12.982
I just thought maybe
you'd want to ease back in.

19:13.050 --> 19:15.621
What is a vacation for,
if not to recuperate

19:15.738 --> 19:20.613
so that one can return to work
at full strength?

19:23.910 --> 19:25.443
Um, more suction here,
Qadri.

19:27.209 --> 19:29.208
His ischemia time's
getting up there.

19:29.276 --> 19:30.667
I'm aware.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.427
You know, some vacations
are so strenuous

19:33.495 --> 19:35.636
that you need a vacation
from your vacation.

19:35.738 --> 19:37.214
Ben Warren,

19:37.812 --> 19:39.825
as handsome as you look
in your uniform

19:39.893 --> 19:42.972
and as grateful as I am that
you are still alive today,

19:43.199 --> 19:44.685
you do not belong
in there.

19:44.753 --> 19:46.347
Get out.
I brought your patient in.

19:46.472 --> 19:48.489
I just wanted to see
how he was doing.

19:48.667 --> 19:49.909
And how you're doing,

19:50.089 --> 19:53.084
since it's your first day back
from vacation.

19:53.152 --> 19:54.609
Okay,
my vacation is over.

19:54.686 --> 19:57.373
I went on it,
and I am back.

19:57.450 --> 20:00.163
It was glorious,
but like all experiences,

20:00.240 --> 20:02.480
it now lives on in
the cherished memories

20:02.574 --> 20:04.159
that I share
with no one but myself.

20:04.410 --> 20:06.745
So stop talking about
my vacation!

20:12.253 --> 20:14.308
- Hey, where'd you go?
- None of your business!

20:14.402 --> 20:17.066
Warren, um, she's right.

20:17.183 --> 20:18.609
You don't belong in here.

20:18.686 --> 20:22.331
Uh, I've got my eye
on everything in here.

20:26.450 --> 20:27.793
Now his bowel is
getting dusky.

20:27.870 --> 20:29.824
This kid's gonna wind up
with a stool bag.

20:29.902 --> 20:31.724
Oh, no, sir.
Not on my watch.

20:31.792 --> 20:33.839
Not on my first day back
he's not.

20:41.730 --> 20:43.033
Where's Koracick?

20:43.222 --> 20:44.464
I sent him
to see Kimmie.

20:44.550 --> 20:46.277
- You did what?
- Damn it.

20:46.378 --> 20:48.109
What? Why?
Was that wrong?

20:48.186 --> 20:51.417
♪♪

20:52.519 --> 20:55.033
Oh, God.
Of course that was wrong.

20:55.110 --> 20:56.796
I'm just calling it
the way I see it,

20:56.863 --> 20:58.147
and the sooner
you face the truth...

20:58.214 --> 20:59.843
You're full of crap
and you know it!

20:59.910 --> 21:01.552
"Hamilton" only made
your top three

21:01.620 --> 21:02.787
because it's new and shiny.

21:02.855 --> 21:04.789
And you only left it off
your list because you're bitter

21:04.856 --> 21:06.879
that you couldn't score tickets
for the original cast.

21:06.946 --> 21:08.995
It goes "Cabaret,"
"Hamilton," "Rent."

21:09.081 --> 21:11.793
So... no Sondheim?

21:11.870 --> 21:13.777
Stephen Sondheim.

21:13.855 --> 21:16.035
- Damn it. Sondheim.
- Yeah, can't count him out.

21:16.103 --> 21:18.185
Count of three. Best Sondheim.
One, two, three.

21:18.253 --> 21:20.004
- "Into The Woods." Oh.
- "Sweeney Todd." Gross.

21:20.071 --> 21:21.529
No, he wielded
a hell of a scalpel.

21:21.597 --> 21:23.475
They've been at this
for 20 minutes straight.

21:23.542 --> 21:24.839
Happiest I've seen her
in days.

21:24.907 --> 21:26.913
"Into the Woods," a quarter
of the Broadway audience

21:26.980 --> 21:28.334
left that show
at intermission.

21:28.402 --> 21:30.316
'Cause they want
an easy, happy ending.

21:30.417 --> 21:32.605
But, hello, that's why
it's brilliant.

21:32.673 --> 21:35.206
Doctors. Second opinion.
Weigh in.

21:36.768 --> 21:37.951
Uh...

21:38.035 --> 21:40.162
Ah,
love me a good weirdo.

21:40.230 --> 21:41.850
I can see why you're trying
to rush the process.

21:41.917 --> 21:43.607
Good. Now we can make
some headway.

21:43.675 --> 21:44.913
Oh, I have no doubt
we're gonna make

21:44.980 --> 21:46.678
this ultrasound our bitch
and save a lot of lives.

21:46.745 --> 21:48.756
But let's not, uh, delude
ourselves into thinking

21:48.824 --> 21:50.675
Kimmie's
will be one of them.

21:50.839 --> 21:52.763
There is no easy,
happy ending here.

21:52.831 --> 21:54.964
She's
got a few months to live,

21:55.089 --> 21:56.860
you know,
if she's lucky.

22:09.843 --> 22:11.640
New Guy.

22:12.610 --> 22:14.369
I know.
I shouldn't be here.

22:14.446 --> 22:16.159
I just placed a clamp.

22:16.312 --> 22:17.533
On an aorta.

22:17.687 --> 22:18.991
- You did?
- Yes!

22:19.101 --> 22:21.455
Damn. I... I gotta admit
I'm kinda jealous.

22:21.523 --> 22:22.913
It was amazing.

22:22.990 --> 22:24.611
And awful, because
as soon as I placed it,

22:24.638 --> 22:26.568
the whole OR erupted,
and then...

22:27.624 --> 22:28.963
It's hard having
a front-row seat,

22:29.031 --> 22:30.339
and then getting kicked out,
ya know?

22:30.406 --> 22:31.533
I do.

22:31.952 --> 22:33.836
I just hope he makes it.

22:35.601 --> 22:37.484
You... You wanna see
for yourself?

22:37.945 --> 22:39.594
Look, I-I can't get you
front row,

22:39.662 --> 22:41.930
but... I can get you
pretty close.

22:42.109 --> 22:43.242
Come on.

22:44.500 --> 22:46.033
The patient's mother's
here.

22:46.110 --> 22:47.609
She's looking
for an update.

22:47.686 --> 22:49.430
Okay,
the graft is ready.

22:50.265 --> 22:52.408
Dr. Qadri, can you go out
and update...

22:52.476 --> 22:54.393
Oh, no,
Dr. Qadri cannot.

22:54.461 --> 22:58.018
She cannot go and update this
patient's mother by herself

22:58.086 --> 22:59.414
because she's an intern.

22:59.492 --> 23:02.416
An intern who has yet to update
any patient's family

23:02.484 --> 23:03.588
about anything.

23:03.656 --> 23:06.760
And she's not going to start
by facing that mom alone

23:06.828 --> 23:08.844
to tell her her two boys

23:08.912 --> 23:10.859
might not make it
out of this alive.

23:13.070 --> 23:14.484
Oh, for the love of...

23:17.569 --> 23:19.069
Mm.

23:22.773 --> 23:24.449
I had a heart attack!

23:24.844 --> 23:26.172
Hmm.

23:26.320 --> 23:29.166
That's what Dr. Webber has gone
out of his way not to say.

23:29.234 --> 23:31.319
He's gone out of his way
all damn day

23:31.396 --> 23:35.924
to not reveal my secret,
to not let me do my job,

23:35.992 --> 23:40.315
and to make sure that I'm not
putting any extra stress

23:40.383 --> 23:42.623
and strain on my body,
and it's not okay.

23:42.700 --> 23:44.471
I know better than
to show up

23:44.539 --> 23:46.112
to this hospital
before I'm ready,

23:46.180 --> 23:47.819
I know better than to put
a child's life

23:47.896 --> 23:49.489
in my hands
before I am ready,

23:49.566 --> 23:52.533
and I am ready
to do my job.

23:52.883 --> 23:57.875
Now, I would appreciate everyone
doing their own jobs, too.

24:02.030 --> 24:05.643
Focusing on the field,
until the awkward goes away.

24:05.711 --> 24:07.057
5-0 prolene, please.

24:07.125 --> 24:08.440
Dr. Bailey, look,
all we're...

24:08.508 --> 24:10.048
Babysitters get paid
$10 an hour.

24:10.116 --> 24:11.242
You want to get paid
$10 an hour?

24:11.309 --> 24:12.981
I can arrange for that.

24:13.318 --> 24:14.372
Go.

24:17.839 --> 24:19.129
Come on.

24:25.827 --> 24:26.991
Clive's nice.

24:27.421 --> 24:28.525
He's cute.
He's funny.

24:28.593 --> 24:29.796
Aww.
And the sex?

24:29.897 --> 24:31.779
Wow, you're just getting
straight to it, huh?

24:31.856 --> 24:34.329
Well, Carina is...
Is only getting better.

24:34.397 --> 24:36.452
There's, like, no slump.

24:36.538 --> 24:37.790
It's the opposite
of a slump.

24:37.858 --> 24:39.228
It's a boom.
It's a sex boom.

24:41.233 --> 24:43.069
Ladies, what are
we laughing about?

24:43.146 --> 24:44.337
- Sex.
- Nothing.

24:44.405 --> 24:45.423
Sex? Really?

24:45.491 --> 24:47.793
I was expecting
maternal mortality

24:47.870 --> 24:49.018
or rechargeable hearts
or something.

24:49.085 --> 24:50.793
But, no, that's...
I can talk sex.

24:50.870 --> 24:52.709
Well, you know, the thing about
rechargeable hearts...

24:52.776 --> 24:55.351
Maggie's got a date
with Clive.

24:55.670 --> 24:57.252
- Is Clive still around?
- Mm-hmm.

24:57.320 --> 24:58.955
- Mm-hmm.
- Look at that. That's adorable.

24:59.022 --> 25:00.087
I got a date tonight,
too.

25:00.155 --> 25:01.353
- Oh.
- Uh, Priya is her name.

25:01.421 --> 25:02.345
Oh.
Yeah.

25:02.413 --> 25:03.518
- Who? - Priya.
- Did you make that up?

25:03.585 --> 25:04.655
Very cool, brilliant,

25:04.723 --> 25:05.873
- actually. - Oh.
- Mm.

25:05.941 --> 25:07.414
Very attractive.
Human rights attorney, so...

25:07.481 --> 25:08.579
- Well, that's hot.
- That's hot.

25:08.646 --> 25:10.393
- Pretty impressive, yeah.
- Yeah, that is... That's hot.

25:10.460 --> 25:11.108
Interesting.

25:11.176 --> 25:12.642
Um, you know,

25:12.710 --> 25:14.579
I think I'm gonna...
vending machine.

25:14.647 --> 25:15.609
- Really?
- Yeah.

25:15.686 --> 25:16.833
- Oh.
- Huh.

25:16.910 --> 25:18.174
I'm gonna start
double gloving.

25:18.241 --> 25:20.304
My hands smelled like bedpan
when I was eating

25:20.372 --> 25:21.447
- last night.
- Oh.

25:21.515 --> 25:23.593
I scrubbed in on
a bowel resection yesterday.

25:23.700 --> 25:26.374
Being on The Party's good
side has benefits.

25:26.442 --> 25:28.853
I almost called her Dr. Party
this morning

25:28.921 --> 25:30.593
instead of Dr. Kepner.

25:30.661 --> 25:32.608
Is that
a fireable offense?

25:33.163 --> 25:34.905
You're just gonna be
really happy for her.

25:34.987 --> 25:37.584
- No, super happy, overjoyed.
- Okay. Yep.

25:37.700 --> 25:40.311
I never would've pegged myself
as a guy who's into moms,

25:40.379 --> 25:42.351
but moms make you do things
till you get 'em right.

25:43.783 --> 25:45.158
Nope.

25:46.332 --> 25:48.491
- Dr. Roy.
- Hey, buddy.

25:48.559 --> 25:51.199
Um, I've got a patient,
Mr. Wilkins, in 1413,

25:51.276 --> 25:54.499
with a large, super infected
abscess in his groin

25:54.567 --> 25:55.749
that you're gonna
drain for me.

25:55.816 --> 25:57.442
- Um...
- Now.

26:02.370 --> 26:04.366
- Yes, I-I tried.
- Maybe you should try harder.

26:04.434 --> 26:05.505
She's the mother of my kid,

26:05.572 --> 26:06.981
- and this...
- Harder, harder.

26:10.925 --> 26:13.410
Kepner, Grey, I'm about
to update his mother.

26:13.478 --> 26:14.598
What can you tell me?

26:14.666 --> 26:16.394
He had an injury
to his abdominal aorta

26:16.462 --> 26:18.451
- that we're trying to repair.
- Ah, damn.

26:18.519 --> 26:19.621
It's a mess.

26:19.689 --> 26:21.951
We're still trying to evaluate
the extent of the injury.

26:22.019 --> 26:23.292
Can I get a towel?

26:28.104 --> 26:30.066
All right.
Okay, we're good.

26:31.570 --> 26:33.152
So, you're a rule breaker?

26:33.235 --> 26:34.818
Uh, n-no.

26:34.886 --> 26:36.946

I no longer work.

26:39.624 --> 26:40.918
Mm-hmm.

26:45.040 --> 26:47.472

serious injuries

26:47.540 --> 26:48.913
and are in surgery.

26:49.275 --> 26:50.760
We'll let you know more
as soon as we can.

26:50.827 --> 26:52.741
Both of them?

26:53.220 --> 26:54.806
Are they okay?

26:55.290 --> 26:57.293
They're in surgery,
but they'll be okay, right?

26:57.462 --> 26:59.892
We're fighting for them.
We're doing everything we can.

26:59.978 --> 27:01.369
I have a job.

27:01.821 --> 27:03.663
I have to work.

27:03.907 --> 27:06.386
I need to feed them
because they are 14 and 10

27:06.454 --> 27:08.394
and they eat everything
that isn't nailed down.

27:08.462 --> 27:11.279
I cannot hold onto them
every minute of the day.

27:11.361 --> 27:14.033
I have to go to work.
They're 14 and 10.

27:14.110 --> 27:15.872
I mean, they should be able to
be home for a morning

27:15.939 --> 27:18.259
while I go to work
without...

27:19.486 --> 27:20.923
Oh, my God.

27:21.240 --> 27:23.884
Tyler is 14,
and Zach is 10.

27:23.952 --> 27:25.712
They have to be okay.

27:25.780 --> 27:27.556
They have to be okay.

27:27.650 --> 27:29.029
They have to be okay.

27:29.106 --> 27:30.493
Oh, my God.

27:30.687 --> 27:32.126
Oh, my God!

27:36.940 --> 27:39.776
- I can't believe you used to do this.
- What?

27:39.932 --> 27:42.838
This. That.
Y-Y-You did that.

27:43.523 --> 27:45.276
And you were good at it?

27:45.535 --> 27:47.409
Um, yeah.

27:47.580 --> 27:48.980
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- I'm... I'm just saying.

27:49.047 --> 27:52.814
Y-You did this
incredibly cool thing

27:52.993 --> 27:56.213
that probably pays a hell of
a lot more than what we do,

27:56.322 --> 27:59.674
you did it well,
but you walked away from it?

28:00.451 --> 28:01.690
Why?

28:03.932 --> 28:05.143
To do more.

28:05.260 --> 28:08.393
I mean, yes,
I used to do that down there,

28:08.461 --> 28:11.096
with the patients in the OR
where you're trying to fix them,

28:11.164 --> 28:12.534
but I, you know...

28:12.677 --> 28:14.831
I also cut open a guy
with a clipboard.

28:15.112 --> 28:17.159
I mean, y-y-you know the metal
part of a clipboard?

28:17.227 --> 28:18.763
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, I broke it off

28:18.831 --> 28:20.096
and used it as a scalpel.

28:20.164 --> 28:23.252
Cracked his chest because
we were nowhere near an OR

28:23.721 --> 28:25.736
and I... I did
what I had to do.

28:25.910 --> 28:30.135
And I saved his life,
but I... got into trouble.

28:31.117 --> 28:32.556
A lot of trouble.

28:33.033 --> 28:36.939
You know, but I-I never felt
anything but proud.

28:37.590 --> 28:41.853
So now I'm doing a job where
I'm the first one on the scene

28:41.921 --> 28:46.181
and I get to do whatever
it takes to save that life.

28:47.334 --> 28:49.244
And that's only
a good thing.

28:51.790 --> 28:55.761
I was just looking for a
"because fire" kind of answer,

28:55.829 --> 28:57.408
but okay.

28:58.520 --> 29:00.533
Can we listen to what's
going on down there?

29:00.688 --> 29:03.502
- Only if you don't let me talk anymore.
- Mm-hmm.

29:07.199 --> 29:09.582
Hey!
What's going on?

29:09.737 --> 29:12.370
Amelia called Koracick,
and I hate him.

29:12.510 --> 29:14.580
Like, I want put him in
an old-fashioned choke hold

29:14.648 --> 29:15.895
and throw him down the stairs
hate him.

29:15.962 --> 29:19.142
Okay.
You hate him because...

29:19.210 --> 29:21.169
What? I need a reason?
Have you met the guy?

29:21.237 --> 29:24.299
Did something happen?
With Kimmie?

29:24.525 --> 29:27.853
It's just... some kids
get under your skin.

29:42.342 --> 29:44.765
You're dropping out?
Really?

29:44.833 --> 29:46.065
I'm not dropping out,
but I'm not gonna rush

29:46.132 --> 29:48.721
developing this thing over
an unrealistic deadline.

29:49.989 --> 29:51.892
- You don't agree.
- No, I don't.

29:52.420 --> 29:54.475
You think I don't know that
this girl is dying?

29:54.709 --> 29:56.698
You should have seen her
when we first met her.

29:56.765 --> 29:58.266
She is a fraction
of who she was.

29:58.334 --> 30:00.667
But she is still alive,
and she is still full of hope,

30:00.768 --> 30:02.713
and that means we don't
get to say, "I give up."

30:02.783 --> 30:04.036
If doctors said,
"I give up,"

30:04.104 --> 30:05.440
we would all be dead
of cholera right now.

30:05.507 --> 30:07.261
We don't get to give up.
We don't get to write her off.

30:07.328 --> 30:08.549
We don't quit.

30:08.617 --> 30:10.205
Yeah, I know
you think you're right,

30:10.273 --> 30:11.761
but you're used to
Brain Tumor Shepherd,

30:11.828 --> 30:13.421
so you don't hear it
when nonsense

30:13.489 --> 30:14.862
comes out of your mouth.

30:14.948 --> 30:16.255
I am not being crazy.

30:16.323 --> 30:17.612
Then stop being naive.

30:17.680 --> 30:19.697
Stop being a ridiculous
Pollyanna

30:19.765 --> 30:20.822
and please, please

30:20.890 --> 30:22.723
stop diminishing
this little girl's life

30:22.791 --> 30:25.167
by barking things at me that
belong on a refrigerator magnet.

30:25.234 --> 30:26.711
It's beneath you.

30:26.852 --> 30:29.353
She is going to die,
and any effort that you spend

30:29.421 --> 30:31.025
that doesn't go toward
preventing that

30:31.093 --> 30:33.320
is a supreme disservice
to her.

30:33.388 --> 30:35.214
And this...
This is not gonna save her.

30:35.282 --> 30:37.728
This is the only thing
that might save her.

30:37.796 --> 30:38.966
She's not gonna have
much of a life

30:39.033 --> 30:40.416
with an exploded,
flaming skull.

30:40.484 --> 30:42.708
- Well, then, we reduce the heat.
- And you leave the tumor!

30:42.775 --> 30:43.806
You do nothing!

30:43.874 --> 30:45.668
God, you're... Then we attack
it from another angle!

30:45.735 --> 30:47.511
We do something else entirely!
Maybe it's not ultrasound.

30:47.578 --> 30:49.008
Maybe it's some kind of
radiation...

30:49.076 --> 30:50.663
- Sh-Shut up.
- You shut up!

30:50.850 --> 30:52.149
We attack it
from another angle.

30:52.217 --> 30:53.141
I just said that.

30:53.209 --> 30:55.697
And then
we reduce the heat.

30:55.765 --> 30:57.431
Yeah, I said that, too.
Why are you...

30:57.638 --> 30:59.565
No. Mnh-mnh.

30:59.806 --> 31:01.534
With more beams,

31:01.602 --> 31:03.487
we control the amount
of heat generated.

31:03.555 --> 31:06.487
This way we have
more variables.

31:06.555 --> 31:07.768
So two beams?

31:08.041 --> 31:09.743
Or... Or... Or seven.

31:09.811 --> 31:12.633
Or 27, or a thousand

31:12.701 --> 31:15.477
that we run for
shorter periods of time.

31:15.545 --> 31:16.908
So when they enter the skull,
they don't heat it.

31:16.975 --> 31:18.399
And where the beams
come together...

31:18.467 --> 31:19.869
The reinforced waves
are intense enough

31:19.936 --> 31:21.852
that they heat and kill
just the tumor!

31:21.984 --> 31:24.594
I mean, it's...
It's brilliant.

31:24.662 --> 31:26.602
I mean...
I'm brilliant.

31:32.590 --> 31:35.297
Bailey, it's been five minutes
and the bowel hasn't pinked up

31:35.365 --> 31:36.414
and I don't hear any flow.

31:36.482 --> 31:38.197
We're gonna have to consider
resecting this bowel.

31:38.264 --> 31:41.500
Ju... Hold on.
Sometimes it takes a while.

31:45.567 --> 31:47.316
Was it severe?
The MI?

31:47.472 --> 31:48.985
Severely scary.

31:49.478 --> 31:51.325
- A stent?
- CABG.

31:51.464 --> 31:55.149
God, Bailey. I'm sorry.
I just wish that I'd...

32:09.925 --> 32:12.175
Okay. Can I get

- I didn't just try.

36:31.573 --> 36:33.427
Dr. Cerone is gonna be
in the States next week

36:33.495 --> 36:35.409
and has agreed
to come hear your pitch.

36:35.495 --> 36:36.902
What?!
You're kidding.

36:36.971 --> 36:38.029
Wait.
What did you say?

36:38.097 --> 36:40.270
I just said they're standing
between the hose

36:40.347 --> 36:42.766
and the flames right now,
by holding onto that patent.

36:43.897 --> 36:45.104
I mean,
and I should know.

36:45.172 --> 36:47.300
I was literally holding on
to something today

36:47.368 --> 36:49.175
that I couldn't
let go of, either, but...

36:49.307 --> 36:50.810
And then the time came
to step away

36:50.878 --> 36:52.019
and let you take over,

36:52.087 --> 36:54.651
and if there's anyone
he can trust to take over,

36:54.776 --> 36:56.073
- it's you.
- Thank you.

36:56.141 --> 36:58.167
Also I tried to explain
the whole sprinkler thing,

36:58.235 --> 36:59.510
but I don't think
it translated.

36:59.578 --> 37:01.509
Yeah, it really just sounded
like you were screaming at him.

37:01.576 --> 37:03.977
Ah, Romance languages
are passionate.

37:06.158 --> 37:08.497
We don't have to hug now, do we?
I'm not really a hugger.

37:08.565 --> 37:10.305
- Oh, God, no.
- Okay, good.

37:10.430 --> 37:11.664
I had a good time today.

37:11.732 --> 37:13.141
It was nice to meet you,
Dr. Grey.

37:13.573 --> 37:14.760
You too.

37:14.860 --> 37:16.063
I gotta go find my rookie.

37:16.131 --> 37:17.172
- Okay.
- All right.

37:17.240 --> 37:18.766
- Good night.
- See ya.

37:24.860 --> 37:26.480
You home tonight?

37:27.354 --> 37:28.938
Shift ends at 9:00.

37:36.618 --> 37:40.289
W-When I started training,
you... you pushed against it.

37:40.508 --> 37:42.375
I mean, and I get it,
because, you know,

37:42.443 --> 37:44.688
my keeping it from you
and you were thrown.

37:44.758 --> 37:47.172
But still, you...
You pushed.

37:48.024 --> 37:49.946
So I pushed back.

37:51.555 --> 37:53.211
I was so busy pushing

37:54.641 --> 37:57.104
that... I never stopped
to really think about

37:57.172 --> 37:58.258
what I'd be giving up.

37:58.326 --> 38:00.110
Oh, you thought
about it plenty.

38:00.871 --> 38:02.946
But you never stopped
to feel it.

38:04.795 --> 38:08.157
Go on, sit there.
Let yourself feel it.

38:10.895 --> 38:14.446
Then get up...
do what you do.

38:16.764 --> 38:18.008
What are you gonna do?

38:18.313 --> 38:21.693
I... am gonna feel my day,
too.

I just noticed
some of the interns

38:39.477 --> 38:41.493
have nicknamed you
"The Party," so...

38:41.602 --> 38:42.971
Yeah. I'm pretty sure

38:43.039 --> 38:44.272
they mean that
as a compliment.

38:44.340 --> 38:45.991
Well, some of the things
they were saying

38:46.059 --> 38:47.286
weren't exactly
complimentary.

38:47.428 --> 38:49.248
Well, you should hear
what they say about you.

38:49.343 --> 38:50.513
