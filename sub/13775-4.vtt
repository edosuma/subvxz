WEBVTT

00:03.997 --> 00:05.498
Look at her go. Wow.

00:05.564 --> 00:09.702
I was the designated driver for
nine months, and now it's your turn.

00:09.769 --> 00:11.770
So, Jenny, while
you're drinking your way to

00:11.838 --> 00:13.625
Mother of the Year Award, who's
taking care of Chalupa Batman?

00:13.746 --> 00:14.680
Christopher Benjamin?

00:14.747 --> 00:16.047
My mom's in town.

00:16.116 --> 00:17.049
She's watching the kids.

00:18.118 --> 00:19.051
That woman hates me.

00:19.119 --> 00:21.053
No, she does not hate you.

00:21.121 --> 00:22.054
No, she doesn't hate you.

00:22.122 --> 00:24.223
She just thinks Kevin could've
done better, that's all.

00:24.291 --> 00:25.357
She's an anti-Semite.

00:25.425 --> 00:26.358
No, she's not.

00:26.426 --> 00:27.426
No. You got that wrong.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.794
She doesn't like kites.

00:28.861 --> 00:29.928
She thinks they're dangerous.

00:29.996 --> 00:32.030
And by the way, my roommate,
George, is coming by.

00:32.098 --> 00:33.357
Please don't embarrass me.

00:33.477 --> 00:35.101
How is that possible, Taco?

00:35.168 --> 00:36.135
Come on, look at you guys.

00:36.203 --> 00:38.471
I still can't believe you
have a legitimate apartment.

00:38.538 --> 00:39.572
Yeah, it's nicer than Pete's.

00:39.639 --> 00:40.573
Of course it is.

00:40.640 --> 00:41.640
I make a shit-ton of money.

00:41.708 --> 00:42.641
Hey, what's up, George?

00:42.709 --> 00:43.642
How's it going?

00:43.710 --> 00:44.710
How's it going, girl?

00:44.777 --> 00:46.378
Boom, boom, ugh.

00:46.446 --> 00:47.980
Sweet tiger.

00:48.047 --> 00:49.215
Thanks. I'm into tigers.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.416
Hi, I'm George.

00:50.484 --> 00:52.651
Is George short for something else?

00:52.719 --> 00:54.820
My parents were just like,
really into George Lopez.

00:54.887 --> 00:57.256
Well, George, these are
some people I know.

00:57.324 --> 00:58.424
That's Ruxin, my lawyer.

00:58.492 --> 01:01.994
Oh, he could probably help you with that
jaywalking/public urination ticket.

01:02.061 --> 01:02.995
I know.

01:03.062 --> 01:03.996
That was total bull crap.

01:04.063 --> 01:05.464
I was not jaywalking.

01:05.532 --> 01:07.065
I had both feet on the sidewalk.

01:07.134 --> 01:11.069
I knew it, the po-po knew it,
everyone in that bakery knew it.

01:11.138 --> 01:13.239
You were just pissing your pants?

01:13.306 --> 01:15.274
In her defense, she didn't
know that she was urinating.

01:15.342 --> 01:16.509
I was drunk.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.744
Like, it's not public urination
if it's involuntary.

01:18.811 --> 01:19.845
It's like a heart attack.

01:19.912 --> 01:21.347
To my credit, I was, like, 85%

01:21.414 --> 01:23.642
sure I was in a Del Taco.

01:23.762 --> 01:29.636

<font color="#ec14bd">www.addic7ed.com</font>

01:29.756 --> 01:30.789
That was so great, babe.

01:30.857 --> 01:31.823
Hold on.

01:31.891 --> 01:32.958
So much fun.

01:33.026 --> 01:35.294
We should totally do that,
like, every week, right?

01:35.362 --> 01:36.295
Oh, totally.

01:36.363 --> 01:37.296
Yeah, I know.

01:37.364 --> 01:38.297
Yeah. Great.

01:38.365 --> 01:39.298
I'm going back.

01:39.366 --> 01:40.366
Wow. You're late.

01:40.433 --> 01:41.767
Hey, Ma.

01:41.834 --> 01:43.969
Well, it looks like
you've had a lot of fun.

01:44.037 --> 01:45.003
Yeah.

01:45.071 --> 01:49.275
I will go check on Christopher 'cause
I bet he is ready to mow down, so...

01:49.342 --> 01:50.476
Yeah.

01:50.544 --> 01:54.280
You're-you're gonna test first
before you breastfeed, aren't you?

01:54.347 --> 01:55.281
Do you have some test strips?

01:55.348 --> 01:56.282
Oh... sure.

01:56.349 --> 01:57.283
Strips?

01:57.350 --> 02:00.319
No, I got the... Because I've got
some right here that you can have.

02:00.387 --> 02:02.454
Those are like Breathalyzers
for your breast milk.

02:02.522 --> 02:03.789
A breastalyzer.

02:03.856 --> 02:05.524
So why don't you test?

02:05.592 --> 02:06.625
Yeah.

02:06.693 --> 02:09.527
And bring the strip back... Yeah, you know...
...so we can take a look at

02:09.596 --> 02:10.461
it. I'd like to see it.

02:10.530 --> 02:12.498
You know, I'm gonna show you,
'cause it's gonna be fine.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.332
Great.

02:13.400 --> 02:14.166
Going to test.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.000
All right, babe.

02:15.068 --> 02:16.068
One, two, three, testing.

02:16.135 --> 02:17.236
Tell me the truth.

02:17.304 --> 02:18.737
Is she okay with the kids?

02:18.805 --> 02:22.174
Yeah, look how well Ellie turned out.

02:22.242 --> 02:24.910
Honey, the child is a disaster.

02:24.977 --> 02:27.379
Oh, and by the way, it's Elizabeth now.

02:27.447 --> 02:28.581
I'm sorry?

02:28.648 --> 02:29.648
We decided that tonight.

02:29.716 --> 02:30.916
Oh, no, no.

02:30.983 --> 02:32.318
I prefer it, she prefers it.

02:32.385 --> 02:34.520
Mom... She's very happy.

02:34.588 --> 02:36.255
I win. Positive.

02:36.323 --> 02:37.323
Good. See?

02:37.390 --> 02:38.324
Positive.

02:38.391 --> 02:41.660
No, this means that your breast
milk is loaded with alcohol.

02:41.728 --> 02:42.661
What?

02:42.729 --> 02:44.530
So you're gonna have to pump and dump.

02:44.598 --> 02:45.664
No, this is liquid gold.

02:45.732 --> 02:47.866
Well, it's more like Goldschlager.

02:47.934 --> 02:49.702
You don't have to keep talking.

02:49.769 --> 02:51.870
Do you want Christopher to
get drunk on tent whiskey?

02:51.938 --> 02:53.205
I was drinking gimlets.

02:53.273 --> 02:55.407
And tequila.

02:55.475 --> 02:57.676
All the more reason to pump and dump.

02:57.744 --> 02:59.077
Okay, look, look, fine, fine.

02:59.145 --> 03:00.078
Fine, fine.

03:00.146 --> 03:01.413
I am going to pump and dump.

03:01.481 --> 03:03.682
Okay, well, I'm gonna go
check on Elizabeth, then.

03:03.750 --> 03:06.885
Who the hell is Elizabeth?

03:06.953 --> 03:08.387
So, how's your houseguest?

03:08.455 --> 03:09.521
Mom McArthur treating you right?

03:09.589 --> 03:11.957
Yeah, she's been great at
pointing out what a horrible mom

03:12.024 --> 03:13.459
and human being I am.

03:13.526 --> 03:17.062
Which reminds me, she signed me
up for that Mommy & Me class,

03:17.130 --> 03:18.564
and you are going to bring me.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.698
Oh, I don't want to.

03:19.766 --> 03:20.699
It's so uncomfortable.

03:20.767 --> 03:22.968
What guy wants to go to a
place full of boobs where

03:23.035 --> 03:24.970
there's no chance for
a sexual encounter?

03:25.037 --> 03:27.406
The first time I ever went in
there, it was like I was driving

03:27.474 --> 03:29.875
on the highway and there was an
accident, and a breast truck

03:29.942 --> 03:32.611
just flipped over and there were
just titties scattered everywhere.

03:32.679 --> 03:34.613
Oh, that's right. I forgot
you guys hate to catch a

03:34.681 --> 03:36.482
glimpse of a tittie
every now and again.

03:36.549 --> 03:38.784
No, we love seeing the boobs,
but not in this casual context.

03:38.851 --> 03:40.051
It's inappropriate.

03:40.119 --> 03:42.921
Breasts are meant to be ogled
and fondled, not tugged at like

03:42.989 --> 03:45.791
some raccoon pulling on a trash bag.

03:45.858 --> 03:47.092
Hi, guys.

03:47.160 --> 03:48.126
Hey, how's it going?

03:48.194 --> 03:52.765
This is for Christopher, and I'm
going to make him a cap to match.

03:52.832 --> 03:53.732
Oh, Martha, thank you.

03:53.800 --> 03:55.834
Because I notice how
cold it is in his room.

03:55.902 --> 03:56.835
Hey, guys.

03:56.903 --> 03:57.903
Hey.

03:57.970 --> 03:59.104
Oh, there he is.

03:59.172 --> 04:00.406
Oh, bitsy boy.

04:00.473 --> 04:03.342
Oh, I've hardly seen you
since I've been here.

04:03.410 --> 04:04.677
You've been so busy.

04:04.744 --> 04:06.745
But I always make time to come
and check in on these guys

04:06.813 --> 04:08.781
and to help out with little Elizabeth.

04:08.848 --> 04:09.782
Oh, God.

04:09.849 --> 04:10.916
Hear how he made his nut?

04:10.983 --> 04:13.185
He did tell me he made his nut.

04:13.252 --> 04:15.487
I made my nut. Empires don't
get built on couches, huh, you

04:15.555 --> 04:17.488
know what I saying? Someone's
got to work around here.

04:17.557 --> 04:19.491
Well, I know you have to rush
off, but are you hungry?

04:19.559 --> 04:20.492
Why don't I make you something?

04:20.560 --> 04:22.494
Oh, I don't want to put you out.

04:22.562 --> 04:25.497
Besides, Jenny doesn't really keep
any fresh deli meat in the house.

04:25.565 --> 04:27.533
Well, let's see what I can do
with what we've got, okay?

04:27.600 --> 04:28.534
Okay.

04:28.601 --> 04:29.535
She's the best.

04:29.602 --> 04:30.536
She's killing me.

04:30.603 --> 04:33.104
Do you know I am being submitted
to random breast drug tests?

04:33.172 --> 04:33.972
What?

04:34.040 --> 04:34.973
I'm like Lance Armstrong.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.942
Maybe they'll strip me of my kids.

04:37.009 --> 04:37.943
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

04:38.010 --> 04:38.944
Hey, come on, just a sip.

04:39.011 --> 04:40.779
Easy, Livestrong, you're on probation.

04:40.847 --> 04:41.613
I mean, come on.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.515
Taco, what's up with
your roommate, George?

04:43.583 --> 04:44.516
She's super cute.

04:44.584 --> 04:45.351
Yeah, she is.

04:45.418 --> 04:47.152
You ever think of hitting that?

04:47.220 --> 04:48.153
That's a rude question.

04:48.221 --> 04:49.054
Yeah, we... all the time.

04:49.121 --> 04:50.856
Wait, you're sleeping with George?

04:50.923 --> 04:51.690
Uh-huh.

04:51.758 --> 04:53.859
Listen, I don't want to be the
bearer of bad news, but you

04:53.926 --> 04:55.994
guys are living together and
you're sleeping together.

04:56.062 --> 04:58.163
I mean, you're in a relationship.

04:58.231 --> 05:00.165
No, we're just having sex and
we're both not paying rent.

05:00.233 --> 05:00.999
That is it.

05:01.067 --> 05:02.835
Quick question, how many bedrooms?

05:02.902 --> 05:03.669
Two.

05:03.737 --> 05:04.803
How many do you sleep in?

05:04.871 --> 05:05.804
One.

05:05.872 --> 05:08.206
And when you come in, do you
feel the need to say hi to her?

05:08.274 --> 05:10.141
Of course, but that's because
we're gonna have sex.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.978
Well, have you lost your individual
identity and compromised yourself as a man?

05:13.045 --> 05:16.014
Well, yeah, but that's just so
that she doesn't get mad at me.

05:16.082 --> 05:17.015
Bitsy boy has a girlfriend.

05:17.083 --> 05:18.016
What?

05:18.084 --> 05:19.017
Yeah!

05:19.085 --> 05:20.018
I have one of these?

05:21.454 --> 05:22.554
Hey.

05:22.622 --> 05:25.190
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
I'm in a relationship!

05:25.258 --> 05:26.191
Oh, my God.

05:26.259 --> 05:27.325
Sweetheart, your sandwich.

05:27.394 --> 05:28.660
Ooh.

05:28.728 --> 05:29.928
Thanks, Mommy.

05:29.996 --> 05:32.063
It's not very fresh, but I
put lots of mustard on it.

05:32.131 --> 05:33.198
Oh, my God.

05:33.266 --> 05:35.401
Oh, Jenny, time to
test the breast milk.

05:35.468 --> 05:36.402
No.

05:36.469 --> 05:37.503
You're getting a BUI.

05:37.570 --> 05:39.671
But Christopher is child number two.

05:39.739 --> 05:41.840
You cannot tell me that you
weren't more lax with Taco.

05:41.908 --> 05:43.208
What do you mean?

05:43.276 --> 05:44.209
Taco, it's locked.

05:44.277 --> 05:45.411
He's extremely successful.

05:45.478 --> 05:47.078
The other unlock, Taco.

05:47.146 --> 05:48.079
He's an entrepreneur.

05:48.147 --> 05:49.080
Yep, now you got it.

05:49.148 --> 05:50.081
Got it!

05:50.149 --> 05:52.017
He's a self-made man.

05:52.084 --> 05:54.185
He has started so many businesses.

05:54.253 --> 05:56.688
He's ambitious; he's never
worked for anyone but himself.

05:56.756 --> 05:59.396
He's a very high-functioning young man.

05:59.516 --> 06:01.894
High being the operative word.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.777
I can't believe you're still in
a league with these dumb dildos, man.

06:12.844 --> 06:13.610
You mean my best friends?

06:13.679 --> 06:14.444
Yeah, our best friends.

06:14.512 --> 06:15.279
How's Brian?

06:15.346 --> 06:16.113
Kevin?

06:16.181 --> 06:17.882
Still married to that Asian girl?

06:17.949 --> 06:18.783
Jenny, who's white? Yep.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.584
All right, Raffi, I'll
see you later, buddy.

06:20.652 --> 06:22.252
Honey, Baby Geoffrey swim class, 2:30.

06:22.320 --> 06:23.120
Today?

06:23.188 --> 06:23.954
Yeah.

06:24.022 --> 06:25.089
It's every Sunday?

06:25.157 --> 06:27.658
No, it's not every Sunday,
but it's fall and winter.

06:27.726 --> 06:29.393
The last class is on February 3.

06:29.460 --> 06:30.394
Super Bowl Sunday?

06:30.461 --> 06:32.262
Ah, you don't care about that shit.

06:32.330 --> 06:34.431
Oh, great, so I'll just go
swimming with Geoffrey and a

06:34.499 --> 06:37.042
bunch of disgusting children in a hot pool
on Sundays instead of watching football.

06:37.162 --> 06:37.887
You're a great daddy.

06:38.001 --> 06:38.934
I love you, babe. Bye.

06:39.002 --> 06:39.935
I love you.

06:40.003 --> 06:43.347
I could watch her walk
out of a room for hours.

06:43.606 --> 06:45.207
My sister's body is bonkers.

06:45.275 --> 06:46.374
I hope you are hitting that.

06:46.442 --> 06:47.883
You know what, I have an idea.

06:48.003 --> 06:49.178
Jerk-off party?

06:49.245 --> 06:50.012
No. No.

06:50.079 --> 06:50.846
Let's do this.

06:50.914 --> 06:52.345
I like where this is going.
Okay, put it away and just listen to me.

06:52.465 --> 06:55.607
What if you took
Geoffrey to swim class?

06:55.727 --> 06:56.486
Yes, done.

06:56.606 --> 06:59.186
Obviously your kid needs a male
role model, 'cause I'll be

06:59.305 --> 07:01.139
honest with you, he's soft.

07:01.207 --> 07:02.207
'Cause he's four.

07:02.275 --> 07:03.308
'Cause he's your son.

07:03.376 --> 07:04.309
No.

07:04.377 --> 07:06.545
You spend all your time
reading books, and looking at

07:06.612 --> 07:10.208
numbers and letters like
they mean something.

07:10.328 --> 07:11.094
They do.

07:11.162 --> 07:11.928
Do you know how to read?

07:11.996 --> 07:13.213
I get by, all right?

07:13.333 --> 07:14.332
What do you know?

07:14.452 --> 07:16.438
- You know, like... red means stop.
- Great.

07:16.558 --> 07:17.731
- Green means go.
- Good.

07:17.851 --> 07:18.664
Yellow's the other one.

07:18.753 --> 07:19.919
Do you want to do this with Geoffrey?

07:19.980 --> 07:20.749
Yes, I'm telling you.

07:20.869 --> 07:21.309
Okay.

07:21.355 --> 07:22.706
I really want to...
Then you need to listen to these rules.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.212
- I'm listening!
- Red!

07:24.713 --> 07:25.932
Okay, a few rules.

07:26.052 --> 07:27.395
One, no smoking.

07:27.515 --> 07:28.315
Cigarettes or drugs?

07:28.383 --> 07:29.149
Both.

07:29.217 --> 07:31.099
Oh, come on.
How long does this class even last?

07:31.219 --> 07:31.905
Like an hour.

07:32.141 --> 07:32.875
<i>What?</i>

07:32.995 --> 07:34.181
<i>Two, no swearing.</i>

07:34.301 --> 07:35.322
<i>Oh, shit on me.</i>

07:35.390 --> 07:37.304
<i>Three, no knives.</i>

07:37.424 --> 07:38.624
<i>What if there's an attack?</i>

07:38.692 --> 07:40.109
<i>It's a bunch of children
and mothers in a pool.</i>

07:40.229 --> 07:41.813
<i>That's exactly what I would attack.</i>

07:41.921 --> 07:44.113
<i>And here's the fourth, and
this is the most important.</i>

07:44.233 --> 07:47.247
<i>You need to pretend to be me,
and that's our secret, okay?</i>

07:47.367 --> 07:49.101
<i>So that Sofia doesn't know...
All right.</i>

07:49.168 --> 07:50.902
<i>...that you're pretending
to be Rodney Ruxin.</i>

07:50.970 --> 07:51.565
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>Do we have a deal?</i>

07:51.685 --> 07:52.485
<i>Yeah. Deal.</i>

07:52.715 --> 07:54.063
- <i>Great.</i>
- <i>No, wait. Do you have a sister?</i>

07:54.183 --> 07:55.555
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- <i>I get to do her.</i>

07:55.675 --> 07:57.536
<i>She lives in Milwaukee, she's
married to a dentist, and she's</i>

07:57.656 --> 07:59.165
<i>got IBS, so have at her.</i>

07:59.267 --> 08:01.735
<i>Oh, I will.</i>

08:01.803 --> 08:03.971
<i>So George and I have a
couple's night planned, which</i>

08:04.039 --> 08:05.239
<i>you guys are all invited to.</i>

08:05.307 --> 08:07.208
<i>I'm down for a night out.</i>

08:07.275 --> 08:09.409
<i>Can't do it, Mama's watching.</i>

08:09.477 --> 08:10.244
<i>Whoa!</i>

08:10.312 --> 08:12.213
<i>Larry Fitzgerald TD!</i>

08:12.280 --> 08:15.449
<i>I have got so many receivers, I don't
even know what to do with them all.</i>

08:15.516 --> 08:16.283
<i>Please.</i>

08:16.351 --> 08:17.218
<i>Maybe trade them away.</i>

08:17.285 --> 08:18.219
<i>Make me an offer.</i>

08:18.286 --> 08:19.086
<i>Somebody's hungry.</i>

08:19.154 --> 08:21.588
<i>Oh... Look who it is.</i>

08:21.656 --> 08:24.058
<i>Hopefully he can eat
without having a hangover.</i>

08:24.125 --> 08:26.260
<i>Oh... Here we go, mister.</i>

08:26.328 --> 08:27.794
<i>Buddy, are you hungry?</i>

08:27.863 --> 08:28.795
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

08:28.864 --> 08:29.629
<i>Okay.</i>

08:29.697 --> 08:31.298
<i>Oh, no... Oh, come on, Jenny.</i>

08:31.366 --> 08:32.299
<i>Really?</i>

08:32.366 --> 08:33.133
<i>Oh, Jenny, please.</i>

08:33.201 --> 08:34.134
<i>Look, Jenny, I'm sorry.</i>

08:34.202 --> 08:35.836
<i>Are we doing that right
here, right now?</i>

08:35.904 --> 08:36.937
<i>What?</i>

08:37.005 --> 08:39.173
<i>There are gentlemen here
trying to watch a game.</i>

08:39.241 --> 08:40.573
<i>The boob, hello.</i>

08:40.640 --> 08:43.977
<i>Um, yes, I am in the privacy
of my own home, the</i>

08:44.044 --> 08:46.247
<i>games are on, this is the best
TV in the house, so yeah.</i>

08:46.314 --> 08:47.081
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

08:47.148 --> 08:47.915
<i>Nobody wants to see this.</i>

08:47.983 --> 08:48.749
<i>Low class.</i>

08:48.816 --> 08:50.484
<i>This kind of stuff does
not fly at our place.</i>

08:50.551 --> 08:52.253
<i>Come on, Pete, what do you say?</i>

08:52.320 --> 08:53.120
<i>Marshawn Lynch for Wes Welker?</i>

08:53.188 --> 08:55.789
<i>I... I can't look at you and talk
to you right now, all right?</i>

08:55.857 --> 08:57.491
<i>You want some Wes Welker.</i>

08:57.558 --> 08:59.326
<i>I do not negotiate with
nipples, I'm sorry.</i>

08:59.394 --> 09:01.028
<i>You need some Wes Welker.</i>

09:01.096 --> 09:01.862
<i>Give me Doug Merton.</i>

09:01.930 --> 09:03.530
<i>All right, you know what?</i>

09:03.598 --> 09:05.366
<i>I'll pull my dick out
for Marshawn Lynch.</i>

09:05.433 --> 09:06.200
<i>No.</i>

09:06.268 --> 09:07.968
<i>I can't believe he said "no" to that.</i>

09:08.036 --> 09:08.802
<i>Neither can I.</i>

09:08.870 --> 09:09.703
<i>Look at your enemies.</i>

09:09.771 --> 09:10.537
<i>It's like prison.</i>

09:10.605 --> 09:12.206
<i>Find the strongest person... Arms up!</i>

09:12.274 --> 09:14.008
<i>...separate her from the rest.</i>

09:14.075 --> 09:15.976
<i>Separate the chubby girl, 'cause
she looks like she runs this</i>

09:16.044 --> 09:16.944
<i>place.</i>

09:17.012 --> 09:17.978
<i>Take her down.</i>

09:18.046 --> 09:19.679
<i>Remember what I told
you about karate chop?</i>

09:19.747 --> 09:20.514
<i>What are you gonna do?</i>

09:20.581 --> 09:21.681
<i>Show me. Come on!</i>

09:21.749 --> 09:22.616
<i>Oh, that's right.</i>

09:22.683 --> 09:25.786
<i>Now, remember... if anybody
asks, I'm your father.</i>

09:25.853 --> 09:26.787
<i>Let's do this.</i>

09:26.854 --> 09:28.622
<i>Oh, I'm seeing some new faces.</i>

09:28.689 --> 09:29.623
<i>Hi!</i>

09:29.690 --> 09:30.457
<i>How you doing?</i>

09:30.525 --> 09:31.292
<i>I'm Gail.</i>

09:31.359 --> 09:33.360
<i>Rodney Ruxin, Esquire.</i>

09:33.428 --> 09:34.194
<i>Nice to meet you.</i>

09:34.262 --> 09:35.162
<i>Means I'm a lawyer.</i>

09:35.230 --> 09:35.996
<i>Great.</i>

09:36.064 --> 09:37.164
<i>This is, uh, Geoffrey.</i>

09:37.232 --> 09:38.632
<i>Hey, Geoffrey.</i>

09:38.699 --> 09:39.666
<i>Are you ready to swim?</i>

09:39.734 --> 09:40.534
<i>Let's do this!</i>

09:40.601 --> 09:41.368
<i>Nice.</i>

09:41.436 --> 09:43.237
<i>How many kids you got in this class?</i>

09:43.305 --> 09:44.071
<i>Uh, about ten.</i>

09:44.139 --> 09:45.839
<i>How many do you expect to survive?</i>

09:45.907 --> 09:46.673
<i>All of them.</i>

09:46.741 --> 09:49.676
<i>If you're doing your job right,
only the strong survive.</i>

09:49.744 --> 09:50.577
<i>All right, Mr. Ruxin.</i>

09:50.645 --> 09:52.413
<i>Everybody calls me Rodney.</i>

09:52.480 --> 09:53.247
<i>Cool.</i>

09:53.315 --> 09:55.215
<i>All right, we're gonna start
with the Superhero, okay?</i>

09:55.283 --> 09:57.017
<i>All you do, bend forward, and
then you're gonna act like</i>

09:57.085 --> 09:59.920
<i>a superhero, put your arms up and
then you push the water back.</i>

09:59.988 --> 10:01.855
<i>Remember what I taught you.</i>

10:01.923 --> 10:02.756
<i>Do this, but then stab.</i>

10:02.824 --> 10:04.091
<i>Just do stab, stab.</i>

10:04.159 --> 10:06.060
<i>Swim, swim, stab.</i>

10:06.127 --> 10:07.995
<i>Who wants to get in the pool?</i>

10:08.063 --> 10:09.696
<i>Getting in the pool now?</i>

10:09.764 --> 10:10.530
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:10.598 --> 10:11.365
<i>Cool.</i>

10:11.433 --> 10:12.499
<i>Nice and steady, all right?</i>

10:12.567 --> 10:14.734
<i>Not too hard, not too
rough, just little kicks.</i>

10:14.802 --> 10:15.569
<i>Good, nice and gentle.</i>

10:15.636 --> 10:16.403
<i>Little teeny kicks.</i>

10:16.471 --> 10:17.404
<i>There you go.</i>

10:17.472 --> 10:18.405
<i>Come on.</i>

10:18.473 --> 10:19.406
<i>Nice!</i>

10:19.474 --> 10:21.408
<i>Okay, kick... keep kicking.</i>

10:21.476 --> 10:24.945
<i>Raffi bomb!</i>

10:28.083 --> 10:28.949
<i>Whoa!</i>

10:29.017 --> 10:29.850
<i>What are you doing?</i>

10:29.917 --> 10:31.685
<i>You have not held him underwater.</i>

10:31.752 --> 10:33.620
<i>You have not done anything that
is viable survival skills.</i>

10:33.688 --> 10:34.455
<i>Okay.</i>

10:34.522 --> 10:36.256
<i>Well, I'm teaching him
how to kick and float.</i>

10:36.324 --> 10:37.871
<i>You've got him all hooked up to all this stuff.
What is this stuff?</i>

10:37.939 --> 10:40.609
<i>You think, when the Russians attack,
we're all gonna get one of these?</i>

10:40.729 --> 10:41.979
<i>Wasting this kid's time.</i>

10:42.099 --> 10:43.077
<i>You know what?</i>

10:43.145 --> 10:45.786
<i>First of all, I appreciate
your enthusiasm, okay?</i>

10:45.906 --> 10:48.174
<i>Because all these other dads,
they come out here, they just</i>

10:48.242 --> 10:50.143
<i>check their phones for the
football scores, and I like that</i>

10:50.210 --> 10:52.412
<i>you're in the pool and
you're taking an interest.</i>

10:52.479 --> 10:53.775
<i>Yeah, I'm not like these other dads.</i>

10:53.895 --> 10:54.907
<i>They're weak.</i>

10:55.027 --> 10:56.449
<i>Like your husband, I'm sure.</i>

10:56.517 --> 11:00.786
<i>Well, I'm single, so...
Whee!</i>

11:00.854 --> 11:02.088
<i>How's it going?</i>

11:09.360 --> 11:12.742
Hey, everybody, welcome to Mommy & Me.

11:12.862 --> 11:14.663
We're gonna get started
in a few minutes.

11:14.731 --> 11:16.498
- Hi, sorry I'm late.
- Oh, hey! Oh, no problem.

11:16.566 --> 11:18.247
Hey hey hey.

11:18.367 --> 11:19.906
2:00, Kristin Cavallari.

11:20.026 --> 11:21.036
There's a spot right over there.

11:21.104 --> 11:22.164
That'd be great, thank you.

11:22.284 --> 11:23.233
You know who she's engaged to?

11:23.353 --> 11:23.967
Jay Cutler.

11:24.087 --> 11:24.962
And she brought the Cutler baby.

11:25.442 --> 11:26.209
The Cutlet.

11:26.276 --> 11:27.176
That's Baby Cutlet.

11:27.244 --> 11:28.011
She's coming over here.

11:28.078 --> 11:29.712
Hi, is there room for me here?

11:29.779 --> 11:30.546
Uh, yeah.

11:30.614 --> 11:32.248
Yes, in fact, he was just leaving.

11:32.316 --> 11:33.082
He can totally scoot over.

11:33.150 --> 11:34.083
No, nope. I'm staying.

11:34.151 --> 11:35.267
Gosh, I thought I was gonna be so late.
I had to pump.

11:35.387 --> 11:36.510
Oh, no, you're good,
they're running late.

11:36.630 --> 11:38.600
Should I clear out some
space for Daddy here?

11:38.720 --> 11:40.912
Oh, no, Daddy would love to
be here, but he's working.

11:41.032 --> 11:41.720
Oh.

11:41.840 --> 11:42.503
Yeah.

11:42.623 --> 11:43.361
Oh. Daddy's working.

11:43.481 --> 11:47.094
Oh, I know that look, that's the
"oh, I wish Jay was coming" look.

11:47.214 --> 11:47.989
Jay?

11:48.109 --> 11:51.185
Jay... Who's this Jay you speak of?

11:51.305 --> 11:52.744
You can cut the shit.

11:52.864 --> 11:57.232
Oh... Right, Jay! The... Jay... the quarter...
quarter thrower.

11:57.352 --> 11:58.541
You know what's so ridiculous?

11:58.608 --> 12:00.243
Guys used to come up to me
and hit on me all the time.

12:00.310 --> 12:03.879
Now I can't go anywhere without guys
coming up like, "Hey, how's Jay's thumb?"

12:03.947 --> 12:06.382
Or, "How many yards do you
think he's gonna throw for?"

12:06.450 --> 12:08.051
That is so inappropriate.

12:08.118 --> 12:08.884
I know.

12:08.952 --> 12:10.444
How is his thumb?

12:10.920 --> 12:11.686
Really?

12:11.753 --> 12:12.520
You, too?

12:12.587 --> 12:13.354
Sorry.

12:13.422 --> 12:15.389
We can absolutely talk about
how beautiful your baby is.

12:15.457 --> 12:17.794
All the other players
must just love him.

12:17.914 --> 12:19.681
Bet you Matt Forte
thinks he's really cute.

12:19.749 --> 12:21.383
Matt is great with him, yeah.

12:21.450 --> 12:22.217
Yeah.

12:22.284 --> 12:22.934
Probably just bounces him on his knee.

12:23.054 --> 12:25.060
As long as his ankle is strong enough.

12:25.180 --> 12:27.159
Let me guess.
You didn't draft Michael Bush.

12:27.279 --> 12:28.949
Forgot to handcuff him to Matt Forte?

12:29.069 --> 12:32.599
Listen, Cavallari, all I'm looking
for is a little bit of information.

12:32.719 --> 12:34.415
Monday night's game vs. Dallas.

12:34.535 --> 12:36.080
Forte's listed as questionable.

12:36.200 --> 12:37.870
I mean, what is questionable?

12:37.990 --> 12:38.442
What is it?

12:38.562 --> 12:40.121
It's how you're behaving right now.

12:40.752 --> 12:42.008
Mmm, touché, Cavallari.

12:42.128 --> 12:45.457
Oh, and I think something questionable
is going on in that diaper.

12:45.577 --> 12:46.663
Oh, come here, buddy.

12:46.783 --> 12:48.416
That is a Cutler poop.

12:48.536 --> 12:50.180
Cutler poop, Cutler poop.

12:50.300 --> 12:51.921
That must be a monster poop.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.047
I think that went really well.

12:54.699 --> 12:56.067
Wait... what are you doing?

12:56.187 --> 12:57.398
That's some good milk.

12:57.518 --> 12:59.020
Don't you dare touch that milk.

12:59.140 --> 13:00.015
That is not your milk.

13:00.135 --> 13:00.923
But it could be.

13:01.043 --> 13:01.669
Leave it alone.

13:01.789 --> 13:02.639
I'm gonna steal that milk.

13:02.759 --> 13:04.536
No, you're not gonna steal breast milk.

13:04.656 --> 13:07.695
I am gonna take it to Taco's party,
have a couple drinks, and let your mom

13:07.815 --> 13:08.632
breastalyze that.

13:08.752 --> 13:11.333
You are ruining my chances of becoming
best friends with Jay Cutler.

13:11.453 --> 13:14.006
You have no chance of being
best friends with Jay Cutler.

13:14.126 --> 13:19.141
I have a chance of having a great time
and a couple of drinks at Taco's party.

13:19.261 --> 13:20.267
You really want to milk-dope?

13:20.387 --> 13:21.050
Come on, babe.

13:21.170 --> 13:22.244
Cutler baby breast milk?

13:22.364 --> 13:23.898
Think about how strong
our baby will be.

13:24.018 --> 13:24.913
Oh, God.

13:25.261 --> 13:27.439
Cutler baby breast milk
inside of our son.

13:27.559 --> 13:30.567
He could be a quarterback at
least at junior high level.

13:30.687 --> 13:31.746
- Come on.
- All right, I'm in.

13:31.866 --> 13:32.784
- Yeah?
- Let's do it.

13:32.904 --> 13:34.895
- Okay. Cover me.
- Okay.

13:36.629 --> 13:37.362
Okay.

13:37.482 --> 13:38.183
Stop.

13:38.303 --> 13:39.190
Hey, how you guys doing over there?

13:39.310 --> 13:40.620
- Great.
- So good.

13:40.740 --> 13:41.899
Good. Good.

13:42.019 --> 13:43.946
Go, go, go.
Go, go.

13:44.066 --> 13:45.040
Okay, okay.

13:45.160 --> 13:47.335
Go, go, go, go, go, go.

13:47.403 --> 13:48.436
Okay.

13:48.504 --> 13:49.270
Oh, are you guys leaving?

13:49.338 --> 13:50.788
Oh, those poopy positions.

13:50.908 --> 13:52.283
Yeah, I had Thai for lunch.

13:52.403 --> 13:54.148
Oh... Yeah, we're gonna
have to skedaddle.

13:54.268 --> 13:55.267
Hey, tell Jay to call me.

13:55.387 --> 13:56.249
He's not gonna call.

13:56.369 --> 13:57.033
Bye, Kristin.

13:57.269 --> 13:58.015
Bye.

14:02.058 --> 14:03.688
Ah, hello, friends.

14:03.808 --> 14:04.509
Come on in.

14:04.629 --> 14:05.605
Hey! Thank you.

14:05.725 --> 14:06.960
Good to see you guys.

14:07.080 --> 14:09.373
Welcome to our humble abodes.

14:09.493 --> 14:10.684
You live in one abode.

14:10.804 --> 14:12.790
I hope there was a lot of
traffic on the way over here so

14:12.910 --> 14:13.984
we have stuff to talk about.

14:14.104 --> 14:14.668
No traffic.

14:14.788 --> 14:16.172
Well, thanks for making the trek.

14:16.292 --> 14:18.100
We really appreciate it.
We couldn't get a sitter.

14:18.220 --> 14:19.555
You don't have any kids, Taco.

14:19.675 --> 14:21.246
I heard people saying that, so... Okay.

14:21.366 --> 14:23.371
Hey, guys! Welcome!

14:23.439 --> 14:23.839
George.

14:23.906 --> 14:24.673
You guys remember George.

14:24.741 --> 14:25.406
How's it going?

14:25.474 --> 14:27.175
Thanks, guys, for making
the trek out here.

14:27.243 --> 14:28.343
We could not find a sitter.

14:28.410 --> 14:30.045
I tried that.
That doesn't work, apparently.

14:30.165 --> 14:32.146
Well, you guys have a
lot to catch up on.

14:32.266 --> 14:33.141
I'm gonna go to the bar.

14:33.261 --> 14:34.039
Make yourself at home.

14:34.159 --> 14:35.133
This is nice.

14:35.253 --> 14:36.576
Yeah, very nice.

14:36.696 --> 14:37.894
Two couples.

14:38.014 --> 14:39.320
Couple of couples.

14:40.725 --> 14:42.626
I have so much to learn from you guys.

14:42.694 --> 14:43.327
Thanks, Taco.

14:43.395 --> 14:44.095
Thank you, Taco.

14:44.162 --> 14:46.430
Notice how they're friendly
with each other, but you can

14:46.498 --> 14:47.944
tell there's a lot of disdain
right below the surface.

14:48.064 --> 14:48.618
- Yeah.
- What?

14:48.738 --> 14:50.956
And notice how the female
is wearing granny panties.

14:51.076 --> 14:52.548
I'm not wearing granny panties.

14:52.668 --> 14:54.114
I can tell by the way you walked in.

14:54.234 --> 14:57.671
The granny panties actually help Kevin
not be sexually attracted to her.

14:58.599 --> 15:00.478
Oh, my meatballs!

15:00.545 --> 15:02.591
She is such a great homemaker.

15:02.711 --> 15:04.846
Jesus Christ!

15:04.966 --> 15:06.720
How many butterflies are there, Taco?

15:06.840 --> 15:08.576
Come. Let me show you guys around.

15:09.111 --> 15:12.543
And this is what people
refer to as a living room.

15:12.663 --> 15:14.823
To make it feel more adult
in here, we put away the

15:14.943 --> 15:17.733
skateboards, video games and
most of the trampolines.

15:17.853 --> 15:19.899
I see you kept the
hydroponics out, though.

15:20.019 --> 15:22.297
Those are strictly
medicinal recreational.

15:22.417 --> 15:25.070
And of course, we took out
our fine china for you guys.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.508
- Oh, the bong.
- Wow.

15:26.628 --> 15:28.827
And, Jenny, there's a spare
room back there if you feel the

15:28.947 --> 15:31.486
need to pump... instead of
standing in front of everyone

15:31.606 --> 15:34.103
breasts akimbo, making a
public spectacle of yourself.

15:34.223 --> 15:36.053
I don't do that, Taco.

15:36.481 --> 15:39.630
But I will need to pump while
I'm here, so thank you.

15:39.854 --> 15:40.450
Please.

15:40.570 --> 15:43.149
Now both my boys are here.

15:43.269 --> 15:44.767
Oh, thank you, Mom.

15:44.887 --> 15:46.769
Just keep her away from the punch bowl.

15:46.889 --> 15:48.251
- Okay, Mom.
- Wienies?

15:48.860 --> 15:49.507
Wienies?

15:49.627 --> 15:50.688
Oh, how lovely.

15:50.808 --> 15:55.095
The bigger ones are sausages, and
then these thin guys are sticks.

15:55.215 --> 15:56.883
Not edible. Thank you.

15:56.931 --> 15:59.075
And here is my Meadows record.

15:59.195 --> 16:00.729
How much of this stuff is ours?

16:00.849 --> 16:03.029
I know. I found my Social
Security card in the bathroom.

16:03.149 --> 16:05.056
Oh, friends, come on.

16:05.176 --> 16:06.524
Let's not talk about trivial matters.

16:06.644 --> 16:10.985
Oh, have you guys met my lawyer Ruxin
and his voluptuous wife Sofia?

16:11.105 --> 16:12.395
- Hello.
- Hi.

16:12.843 --> 16:13.725
Hi, friends.

16:13.845 --> 16:16.834
Can I offer you some
chicken à la king tartare?

16:16.954 --> 16:18.498
Is that raw tuna on top of chicken?

16:18.618 --> 16:21.147
No, it's raw chicken
on top of Cheez Whiz.

16:21.408 --> 16:22.987
Oh, geez.

16:23.107 --> 16:27.373
I'm gonna get us a couple of drinks.

16:27.493 --> 16:28.878
Buddy, you seen this?

16:28.998 --> 16:30.233
Who's the future missing person?

16:30.353 --> 16:32.484
She's crazy.

16:32.604 --> 16:35.502
We just had sex in the cab
on the way over here.

16:35.622 --> 16:36.521
In the back of a cab?

16:36.641 --> 16:38.213
In the back of her body.

16:38.333 --> 16:40.166
She's up for anything.

16:40.286 --> 16:41.754
And you know what?
I've got you to thank for it.

16:41.874 --> 16:44.563
- How so?
- I met her at the swim class.

16:44.683 --> 16:46.789
Wait, Raffi...
She's the teacher.

16:46.909 --> 16:49.907
Raffi, you can't bring the teacher
from the swim class here.

16:50.027 --> 16:51.375
In fact, I did.

16:51.481 --> 16:54.682
You can't! My wife is here, and she can't
know that you're pretending to be me!

16:54.750 --> 16:56.518
You need to get her out of here now.

16:56.585 --> 16:58.020
Fine. Cheers.

16:58.087 --> 16:58.686
Hey, babe.

16:58.754 --> 16:59.454
Hey, babe.

16:59.522 --> 17:00.555
Get me a drink.

17:00.623 --> 17:02.391
Yeah, just finished topping
it off right there.

17:02.458 --> 17:03.558
Thank you.

17:03.626 --> 17:08.096
There you go. Drink up... Mmm...
...'cause you got to go.

17:08.164 --> 17:08.896
What?

17:08.964 --> 17:09.597
You're dumped.

17:09.665 --> 17:12.200
Do you notice that Baby Geoffrey's
calling my brother "Daddy"?

17:12.268 --> 17:15.569
Yeah, you know, I guess a lot
of people confuse Raffi and I.

17:15.637 --> 17:17.406
I don't respect you, okay!

17:17.473 --> 17:19.238
Perfect.
I don't respect myself!

17:19.358 --> 17:20.474
What?! Okay, fine.

17:20.542 --> 17:22.944
Truth be told, there's another girl here.

17:23.012 --> 17:23.444
Awesome.

17:23.512 --> 17:24.546
You're into that?!

17:24.613 --> 17:26.548
How do you think I got
through nursing school?

17:26.615 --> 17:28.383
Ugh! You know what?

17:28.955 --> 17:30.055
You got to go.

17:30.122 --> 17:31.089
I'm not going.

17:31.157 --> 17:32.057
Just pack it up!

17:32.124 --> 17:33.959
I am here for...
I don't find you attractive!

17:34.027 --> 17:34.927
I don't care!

17:34.994 --> 17:37.128
I think your face is gross, I
think your boobs are different

17:37.196 --> 17:39.230
sizes, and I think this is way too big!

17:39.298 --> 17:41.101
All right, you are getting
me so hot right now.

17:41.221 --> 17:44.069
- What?!
- Yes! Treat me like shit.

17:44.136 --> 17:45.275
Oh, God. You know what?

17:45.395 --> 17:47.588
No, let's go. Come over here with me.

17:49.341 --> 17:49.741
Hi.

17:49.809 --> 17:50.108
Hi.

17:50.176 --> 17:51.142
This is Gail.

17:51.210 --> 17:52.243
Gail.

17:52.311 --> 17:53.612
This is Sofia.

17:53.680 --> 17:53.979
Hi.

17:54.047 --> 17:55.246
The light of my life.

17:55.314 --> 17:55.948
Yeah, right.

17:56.015 --> 17:58.016
She's the most beautiful
woman in the world.

17:58.084 --> 17:59.918
Aw... I love you so much.

17:59.986 --> 18:01.319
I love <i>you</i> so much.

18:01.387 --> 18:02.153
Bullshit.

18:02.221 --> 18:06.625
Bullshit? Fine.

18:06.693 --> 18:08.093
Mmm!

18:08.160 --> 18:09.795
Oh!

18:09.862 --> 18:14.466
Wow. Oh, okay. Mmm-mmm!

18:14.533 --> 18:17.435
Sofia Ruxin forever unclean!

18:17.503 --> 18:18.336
I love you.

18:18.404 --> 18:19.170
I love <i>you.</i>

18:19.238 --> 18:20.472
<i>All right, you know what?</i>

18:20.539 --> 18:22.273
<i>I don't have to take this.</i>

18:22.341 --> 18:24.676
<i>You really messed this up, okay?</i>

18:24.744 --> 18:25.143
<i>What?</i>

18:25.211 --> 18:28.146
<i>You could have had sex with
the most pathetic, insecure,</i>

18:28.214 --> 18:29.547
<i>desperate woman you've ever met.</i>

18:29.616 --> 18:32.117
<i>I would have let you put me in a cage!</i>

18:32.184 --> 18:33.018
<i>I have a cage!</i>

18:33.086 --> 18:34.786
<i>Have fun in your cage alone!</i>

18:34.854 --> 18:36.354
<i>Later, Gail.</i>

18:36.422 --> 18:38.156
<i>Hey, what was that all about?</i>

18:38.224 --> 18:39.357
<i>I was just messing around.</i>

18:39.425 --> 18:40.525
<i>But by the way, great kiss.</i>

18:40.593 --> 18:41.126
<i>Ugh!</i>

18:41.193 --> 18:41.827
<i>Really?</i>

18:41.894 --> 18:44.062
<i>I hope you're getting a lot
of this, man, because this is</i>

18:44.130 --> 18:45.897
<i>some terrific kissing right
here my sister does.</i>

18:45.965 --> 18:46.698
<i>I'm a good kisser.</i>

18:46.766 --> 18:47.132
<i>Yeah!</i>

18:47.199 --> 18:47.733
<i>Ugh! No!</i>

18:47.800 --> 18:49.901
<i>I mean, you're such a good
kisser, you got my</i> dick hard,

18:49.969 --> 18:50.836
and I'm your brother.

18:50.903 --> 18:51.469
Oh, come on.

18:51.537 --> 18:52.504
I didn't make you hard!

18:52.571 --> 18:53.538
You can check. You can check.

18:53.606 --> 18:54.472
Ah! Enough! We're going!

18:54.540 --> 18:55.540
Bye, honey. I love you.

18:55.608 --> 18:56.574
Bye. I'll see you.

18:56.643 --> 18:57.408
I love you.

18:57.476 --> 18:58.744
Ugh!

19:05.628 --> 19:07.930
Bathroom? Bathroom? Whoo!

19:07.998 --> 19:11.367
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

19:11.434 --> 19:13.635
Some kind of crazy, awesome
jerk-off machine, I assume?

19:13.703 --> 19:15.926
Hello, beautiful.

19:16.212 --> 19:19.111
This is gonna get gross.

19:19.231 --> 19:20.823
Can we please go home now?

19:20.943 --> 19:21.843
Everyone else is gone.

19:21.911 --> 19:23.111
It's dark out.

19:23.179 --> 19:25.061
Nope. We have the
babysitter until 10:00.

19:25.181 --> 19:27.483
We are going to stay
out until about 10:15.

19:27.550 --> 19:29.318
Can you ease it down a little bit?

19:29.385 --> 19:30.313
You're drinking like Mickey Mantle.

19:30.433 --> 19:32.078
Are you having another drink?

19:32.198 --> 19:36.024
No! Martha, this is the same glass of
wine I have been nursing all night long.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.933
Do you not believe me?

19:38.053 --> 19:39.120
I'll go pump right now.

19:39.188 --> 19:40.088
You can test it.

19:40.155 --> 19:41.990
I think that would be a good idea.

19:42.057 --> 19:42.957
And you know what?

19:43.025 --> 19:45.823
I'll go do it in private 'cause I would
hate to whip these ladies out in public.

19:45.943 --> 19:49.898
I don't think
the public would notice.

19:49.965 --> 19:51.432
Great.

19:51.500 --> 19:53.858
Honey, why are you mad at me?
I didn't even do anything.

19:53.978 --> 19:56.593
Okay, no one ate my chicken
tartare, your friends are lame,

19:56.713 --> 19:59.407
and your mom smoked all of my pot.

19:59.474 --> 20:00.833
- You breaking up with me?
- Yeah. You know what?

20:00.953 --> 20:03.524
If you're ever drunk late-night,
just text me and we can screw.

20:03.644 --> 20:07.768
George, don't stop walking.
Please leave. Whoo!

20:07.888 --> 20:10.019
Since when did you start smoking pot?

20:10.139 --> 20:11.493
I sell Mom weed all the time.

20:11.613 --> 20:14.564
You try knitting all those baby
clothes without some weed.

20:14.684 --> 20:15.939
Yeah. We get baked together.

20:16.059 --> 20:17.861
- What?
- It's never hurt Taco.

20:17.981 --> 20:19.154
It's not gonna hurt me.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.097
I'm not pumping shit.

20:23.165 --> 20:24.686
Thank you, Kristin.

20:24.806 --> 20:25.879
Sorry, Cutler baby.

20:25.999 --> 20:28.636
But suck it, Martha.

20:28.703 --> 20:31.801
Hey, did you guys use that jerk-off
machine in the guest room?

20:31.921 --> 20:34.699
What? Are you talking about
my wife's breast pump?

20:34.819 --> 20:37.214
Nope. I'm talking about
the jerk-off machine.

20:37.334 --> 20:40.996
Okay, does this jerk-off machine, Raffi,
have a circle and some tubes coming

20:41.116 --> 20:41.685
out of it...
Yeah.

20:41.805 --> 20:43.400
- ...and a pump that sucks it out?
- Yeah. Sure.

20:43.520 --> 20:44.593
Oh, my God!

20:44.713 --> 20:45.700
I didn't make a mess or anything.

20:45.820 --> 20:48.802
I put the stuff in the bottle, the
bottle in the bag, and I'm done!

20:48.922 --> 20:50.729
Wait, wait. What bottle?

20:50.849 --> 20:52.101
The bottle that it came with.

20:52.221 --> 20:53.962
Oh, my God.

20:54.029 --> 20:55.243
That's not breast milk.

20:55.363 --> 20:58.799
No, no, no. Mom, Mom, Mom,
Mom, Mom, Mom, no, no, no, no!

20:58.867 --> 20:59.491
I can't place it.

20:59.611 --> 21:02.649
I can. You guys can call me
"Dad" from now on if you want.

21:02.769 --> 21:05.577
Oh... Hey, Martha, test it and weep.

21:05.697 --> 21:06.373
We're weeping.

21:06.493 --> 21:08.657
And by the way, there's plenty
more where that came from.

21:08.777 --> 21:09.441
Oh!

21:09.561 --> 21:11.926
We should get out of here?

21:12.145 --> 21:22.378
