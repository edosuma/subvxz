20:05.243 --> 20:07.411
Finally. My kingdom.

20:07.412 --> 20:09.146
Thank you, Galavant.

20:09.147 --> 20:11.615
Could've done without
the forced death march,

20:11.616 --> 20:13.050
but thank you nonetheless.

20:13.051 --> 20:14.451
What are you gonna do now?

20:14.452 --> 20:15.919
Uh, it's been a tough year.

20:15.920 --> 20:18.221
I lost my wife, my best friend,

20:18.222 --> 20:19.956
my brother tried to kill me.

20:19.957 --> 20:22.092
I really just want to curl up in my room

20:22.093 --> 20:24.628
and eat like 1,000 pounds of cake

20:24.629 --> 20:27.130
and just let my people adore me.

20:27.131 --> 20:28.298
You?

20:28.299 --> 20:31.735
I am going to raise an army
and rescue Isabella.

20:31.736 --> 20:33.437
[Chuckling] Right, right, right.
I knew that.

20:33.438 --> 20:34.538
You know, tell you what.

20:34.539 --> 20:36.940
I'm going to give you whatever you need...

20:36.941 --> 20:41.645
My army, my fastest ships, sharpest horses.

20:41.646 --> 20:44.548
My... I'm sorry.

20:44.549 --> 20:49.752
I swear to god my castle was...Right here.

20:59.714 --> 21:03.215
Well, that's not good.
