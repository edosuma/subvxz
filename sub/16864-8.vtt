00:01.367 --> 00:02.748
Previously on "Rescue Me..."

00:02.868 --> 00:04.436
Oh!
Whoa!

00:04.504 --> 00:05.637
What's goin' on?

00:05.705 --> 00:06.571
What happened to the cookout?

00:06.885 --> 00:08.042
Headquarters shut us down.

00:08.162 --> 00:09.875
Well, this ain't happening
without some noise.

00:09.942 --> 00:11.710
- We could use some noise.
- Yeah, noise is good.

00:11.778 --> 00:12.832
I think we're all scared.

00:13.246 --> 00:14.379
Aren't you?

00:14.447 --> 00:16.347
- Yeah, I'm scared.
- Me, too.

00:16.416 --> 00:18.784
I know I got the brains and the
balls to do the job. All right?

00:18.851 --> 00:20.385
My old man, he'd be proud.

00:20.453 --> 00:23.055
I know that. So, mission accomplished.
Maybe I can make

00:23.122 --> 00:25.090
just as big a difference in the
world doing something else.

00:25.158 --> 00:25.891
Yeah, what else?

00:25.958 --> 00:27.559
How about something that
doesn't involve me getting

00:27.627 --> 00:28.560
fried up in a fire?

00:28.628 --> 00:31.663
God damn it, I don't want to die!
Nobody's gonna remember

00:31.731 --> 00:33.765
me and what I done down there,
not the way they're gonna

00:33.833 --> 00:36.112
remember what that ballerina
did in there tonight.

00:36.232 --> 00:37.254
Who's that?

00:37.637 --> 00:39.905
That's my cousin, the ex-priest.

00:39.972 --> 00:40.806
I mean the dame.

00:40.873 --> 00:43.809
Oh. That's Sheila. Remember I told you
me and her had that thing?

00:43.876 --> 00:46.545
And now she's sleeping with your cousin?
That's cold.

00:46.612 --> 00:48.513
Guys, there's a school
burning down on 117, and

00:48.581 --> 00:49.629
there are no available units.

00:49.749 --> 00:51.783
All right, look. We're gonna
respond to this call ourselves.

00:53.619 --> 00:54.486
You got any tools?

00:54.554 --> 00:55.487
Grab whatever you can.

00:55.555 --> 00:57.556
- Got it? - Got it?
- Got it.

00:57.623 --> 00:59.691
Excuse me. Those guys that
just saved the kids...

00:59.759 --> 01:00.592
Are they firemen?

01:00.660 --> 01:01.927
They used to be.

01:01.994 --> 01:05.964
I have a photo of you and Connor when
you guys aren't even up to my waist.

01:06.032 --> 01:08.809
Connor probably would have been
a lot taller than me now, huh?

01:32.332 --> 01:33.072
Hey.

01:33.192 --> 01:34.525
Hey.

01:34.961 --> 01:38.029
Got up a little early, and
I thought maybe, you know,

01:38.097 --> 01:41.701
maybe I'll just make you some breakfast.
And voila.

01:42.640 --> 01:44.970
Yeah.
You actually used the stove.

01:45.037 --> 01:47.873
Well, that first hour was
figuring out how to turn it on.

01:47.940 --> 01:49.608
Then I realized I didn't need
the bottom part. I just needed

01:49.675 --> 01:52.777
the top part. And... uh...
Yeah. I got that.

01:52.845 --> 01:55.780
Yeah.
There you go. Uh, yeah.

01:55.848 --> 01:56.648
Ah.

01:56.716 --> 01:59.158
Um, extra crispy bacon and...

02:03.675 --> 02:05.104
There you go.

02:06.743 --> 02:08.827
All righty. And coffee.

02:08.947 --> 02:10.729
That's amazing.

02:11.464 --> 02:12.864
So...

02:12.932 --> 02:14.025
Go ahead. Eat.

02:14.967 --> 02:17.335
You know, I think I'm just
gonna start with some coffee.

02:17.403 --> 02:19.491
Go ahead.
Ok.

02:26.560 --> 02:28.573
It's, uh, good.

02:30.737 --> 02:32.165
This is nice. You know?

02:33.158 --> 02:34.567
Uh-huh.

02:34.687 --> 02:35.959
Domestic.

02:38.394 --> 02:39.755
Last night was nice.

02:41.646 --> 02:43.619
Yeah. Yeah.

02:45.280 --> 02:46.518
Yeah?

02:48.205 --> 02:49.933
It was... it was nice.

02:51.604 --> 02:55.090
I don't know.
I thought it was...Good.

02:55.650 --> 02:58.009
Tommy, no, it was very nice.

02:58.249 --> 03:01.551
You know, it just happened, and I don't
really want to dwell on it at the moment.

03:02.882 --> 03:06.387
I think we should...
dwell on it. I think

03:06.700 --> 03:11.492
that it could...Use a little more dwelling.
I think

03:11.724 --> 03:17.301
maybe we should...
Dwell on how we're...

03:17.655 --> 03:21.280
How much we're gonna dwell
on it in the future.

03:22.287 --> 03:24.355
Ok.
So, what does it mean to you?

03:25.444 --> 03:26.454
To me?

03:28.631 --> 03:32.219
It, you know, to me...
You go first.

03:33.688 --> 03:36.042
Ok, let's
cut to the chase. Ok?

03:36.450 --> 03:42.287
So, we had sex... Ok,
excuse me, we made love...

03:42.355 --> 03:45.035
for the first time in I can't
remember how long.

03:45.810 --> 03:48.409
And then I wake up this morning
to this...

03:49.505 --> 03:53.431
beautifully made breakfast,
you know, and a goofy smile

03:53.499 --> 03:56.301
plastered on your face.
So, I can only assume that it means

03:56.369 --> 04:00.872
that we are starting over...
All happy, happy, sunshine and roses.

04:00.940 --> 04:01.703
Ok.

04:02.942 --> 04:04.109
It was not a goofy smile.

04:04.176 --> 04:05.441
It was just a regular smile.

04:05.561 --> 04:06.444
- Ok.
- Ok?

04:06.512 --> 04:07.112
Mm-hmm.

04:07.179 --> 04:11.384
And I'm not... nobody's saying,
"happy, happy" anything.

04:11.426 --> 04:14.740
I'm just saying that last night,
something happened.

04:14.779 --> 04:18.502
It was a natural thing.
It just... it happened, like you said.

04:18.815 --> 04:20.704
But I thought, you know, I don't know.

04:22.296 --> 04:24.666
To me, it was a sign of maybe

04:25.001 --> 04:31.803
the beginning of a
re-comm... commitment thing.

04:32.240 --> 04:34.185
Can you say that again
without stuttering?

04:34.674 --> 04:41.123
I...felt like it was...
something.

04:43.015 --> 04:44.282
- Ok.
- Ok.

04:44.350 --> 04:47.252
Ok. You know, we can
give this one more shot.

04:47.320 --> 04:48.119
Ok.

04:48.518 --> 04:50.191
Ok? But this is the last time.

04:50.763 --> 04:53.089
Ok? 'Cause we can't play
these games anymore, Tommy.

04:53.892 --> 04:58.161
You know? And the two of us, we obviously
have a high threshold for misery, but,

04:58.433 --> 05:00.700
Ok, what we are doing to the kids, no more.

05:01.666 --> 05:04.061
- Ok? So, if this crashes and burns...
- No.

05:04.403 --> 05:07.906
- If this is yet another one of your
empty promises... - No, no, no.

05:07.973 --> 05:10.642
Ok. But if it is, then you
need to know that it will be

05:10.710 --> 05:16.486
the cruelest, most damaging,
most hurtful last thing

05:17.645 --> 05:18.979
that you ever do to me.

05:20.135 --> 05:21.186
I understand.

05:21.253 --> 05:24.830
Ok. And, I mean, if this is
gonna work,

05:25.728 --> 05:27.225
then there are no outside distractions.

05:27.293 --> 05:29.027
None. Totally here.

05:29.095 --> 05:32.320
No Sheila. Zero contact.

05:33.884 --> 05:37.353
Ok? You can say good-bye to her
one last time, but then...

05:38.128 --> 05:39.077
That's it.

05:43.870 --> 05:46.849
Yeah. Done deal.

05:48.013 --> 05:48.981
Ok.

05:49.582 --> 05:54.403
Good. And, you know, same thing
goes for you and, uh, Franco.

05:55.020 --> 05:56.578
Excuse me?

05:57.272 --> 05:59.491
You and Franco... you know, same thing.
Done deal.

05:59.558 --> 06:01.326
No contact.

06:01.374 --> 06:03.286
Tommy, Franco was nothing.

06:04.925 --> 06:05.992
Yeah, right.

06:06.112 --> 06:09.965
Lips... big, gorgeous girl lips.

06:10.085 --> 06:11.662
You don't have to tell
me about the lips.

06:11.782 --> 06:13.605
And pretty eyes and long lashes.

06:13.672 --> 06:15.607
All right, I haven't spent
that much time looking at his

06:15.674 --> 06:17.142
eyeballs, but, you know.

06:17.209 --> 06:18.914
Ok... Tommy, he was pretty.

06:18.927 --> 06:20.745
- That's it.
- Look.

06:20.813 --> 06:24.251
Um, what you had with Sheila,

06:24.673 --> 06:28.099
you know, the two of you turning
to each other in grief after Jimmy...

06:30.423 --> 06:33.969
That was emotional betrayal for me.
I was your wife.

06:36.929 --> 06:39.630
Just... You turning to her was...

06:41.589 --> 06:43.317
It was like a dagger to my heart.

06:44.854 --> 06:47.616
Ok. I got it.

06:48.374 --> 06:51.581
Done deal. Ok.

06:52.978 --> 06:56.347
- So, you can see her one last time.
- Got it.

06:56.415 --> 06:59.517
But if I find out that you
guys have seen each other

06:59.585 --> 07:02.253
afterwards or if there's
anything going on between you...

07:02.321 --> 07:04.062
Nothing. Nothing.

07:06.307 --> 07:07.592
Not happening.

07:07.660 --> 07:08.927
Ok.

07:08.994 --> 07:10.628
Where's the...Hmm.

07:10.696 --> 07:12.797
Uh, are you looking for the cap?

07:12.865 --> 07:13.945
Yes.

07:16.535 --> 07:19.314
Oh. I thought that
was the pepper.

07:25.987 --> 07:30.648
â™ª On another day, c'mon, c'mon,
with these ropes I tied,

07:30.716 --> 07:32.383
can we do no wrong?

07:32.451 --> 07:37.121
Now we grieve, 'cause now
is gone, things were good

07:37.189 --> 07:40.325
when we were young, with
my teeth locked down,

07:40.392 --> 07:45.363
I can see the blood, of a thousand
men who have come and gone,

07:45.431 --> 07:49.968
now we grieve, 'cause now
is gone, things were good

07:50.035 --> 07:53.104
when we were young, is it safe to say?

07:53.172 --> 07:56.541
C'mon, c'mon, was it right to leave?

07:56.609 --> 07:59.777
C'mon, c'mon, will I ever learn?

07:59.845 --> 08:05.450
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon, c'mon â™ª

08:15.059 --> 08:17.909
Now, I've known this guy
40-plus years, so let me do the talking.

08:18.029 --> 08:19.763
All right.
How hard you gonna push?

08:19.831 --> 08:22.399
Don't have to push.
It's politics, stroking egos.

08:22.467 --> 08:24.167
Sounds more like stroking cocks.

08:24.235 --> 08:26.570
Any of that going on, you're
gonna be the one doing it.

08:26.638 --> 08:28.972
This is about me trading
on a long relationship and

08:29.040 --> 08:32.342
you standing in the corner
keeping your piehole shut.

08:32.409 --> 08:34.211
Otherwise, we'll never
get this house reopened.

08:34.279 --> 08:35.044
So, what are you telling me?

08:35.113 --> 08:37.648
- All the letters from the locals,
all the petitions and... - Ooh.

08:37.715 --> 08:39.149
Wait a minute.
Where are the letters?

08:39.217 --> 08:40.583
Shit. I had it on the desk.

08:40.652 --> 08:42.251
You forgot the goddamn letters.

08:42.937 --> 08:44.450
I could have sworn I took 'em.

08:44.570 --> 08:46.924
Jesus Christ. Why don't you
admit you're out to sink us?

08:46.991 --> 08:48.792
Now, you want the house to close.
That way, you're not

08:48.860 --> 08:50.861
connected to any of the crew's
hijinks, and then you can come

08:50.929 --> 08:52.896
down here and slide behind
a desk nice and easy.

08:52.964 --> 08:55.399
You shut your face.
Goddamn letters and petitions...

08:55.466 --> 08:56.500
They don't mean shit, anyway.

08:56.567 --> 08:58.869
They go from his desk over to
the circular file.

08:58.937 --> 09:03.023
You don't do anymore talking,
not until we leave these premises. Done.

09:06.678 --> 09:08.145
- Hey, Dickie.
- God damn it.

09:08.212 --> 09:09.203
Dickiebird, how are you?

09:09.323 --> 09:11.658
I haven't seen your ugly mug
in a million years.

09:11.864 --> 09:14.751
- Dickiebird and Sid the yid together again.
- That's right.

09:14.819 --> 09:16.753
That's what we used to call
him back in probie school...

09:16.821 --> 09:18.221
Sid the yid.

09:18.289 --> 09:19.990
- He's a Jew, you know.
- Do tell.

09:20.058 --> 09:22.092
And we used to call him Dickiebird

09:22.160 --> 09:25.195
Because... My name is Dick, but my first
day on the job, my first call,

09:25.263 --> 09:27.798
I kid you not, a bird
shits on my head. Plop.

09:27.865 --> 09:29.800
It's supposed to be
good luck when that happens.

09:29.867 --> 09:31.635
- Hey! I'm still here, huh?
- Right.

09:31.703 --> 09:35.138
18 years up in the Bronx, 29
years down here. Not bad.

09:35.206 --> 09:37.741
Listen, Dickie. You know why we're here.
I wanted to...

09:37.809 --> 09:41.095
I'm gonna cut you off at the
pass, Sid, save us all some time.

09:41.816 --> 09:43.340
It wasn't an easy decision.

09:43.460 --> 09:45.215
We took a lot of factors
into consideration.

09:45.283 --> 09:46.950
Ok, what sort of factors
were considered?

09:47.018 --> 09:49.720
Let me finish.
There were three of us making final

09:49.787 --> 09:51.188
recommendations to headquarters.

09:51.255 --> 09:54.091
And I gotta tell you, as much
as nobody likes to see houses

09:54.158 --> 09:57.761
closing, I think we did a
goddamn good job in terms of

09:57.829 --> 10:00.964
getting rid of some, you know,
overlapping services and some

10:01.032 --> 10:05.035
underperforming houses
and... I gotta be honest...

10:05.400 --> 10:06.760
One or two trouble houses.

10:07.522 --> 10:11.073
I know we got a couple of bad apples,
I'm not gonna deny that.

10:11.193 --> 10:12.991
But our response times are solid.

10:13.111 --> 10:16.196
Calls are up 20%. Your guys up
on the West Side,

10:16.316 --> 10:17.904
They're gonna be beating
their ass trying to...

10:17.954 --> 10:19.843
It's done, Sid. Ok?

10:20.423 --> 10:23.770
You want to sit and talk about the old
days for a couple of minutes, please.

10:24.056 --> 10:26.875
But your house is closed, and I'm not
discussing it any further.

10:29.215 --> 10:30.413
Ok.

10:31.621 --> 10:32.629
Ok?

10:32.697 --> 10:34.262
Ok? That's all the fight you got?

10:34.382 --> 10:35.932
I'd like to talk to Dick alone, ok?

10:36.000 --> 10:39.403
Now, I'll talk to him.
Dick, I'm not your old pal,

10:39.470 --> 10:41.571
which means I don't have to sit here
and eat your shit sandwich

10:41.639 --> 10:42.806
with a big smile on my face.

10:42.926 --> 10:43.807
Who is this guy?

10:43.875 --> 10:46.247
You know who I am.
I'm one of the new guys...

10:46.367 --> 10:48.873
You know, the pseudo-chiefs
you old-timers can't stand.

10:48.993 --> 10:50.790
But I got a good crew under me.

10:50.910 --> 10:53.361
And breaking us up isn't gonna do
the department any goddamn good.

10:53.481 --> 10:55.307
Plus, I got a neighborhood that needs me.

10:55.427 --> 10:58.255
Now, I know city hall needs to
see some more white faces uptown

10:58.375 --> 11:00.390
before they give a shit about
providing basic services...

11:00.458 --> 11:03.900
Are you lecturing me, shithead?
Because this is my office you're in.

11:04.020 --> 11:07.731
You don't tell me what's good for the
department. You're new here.

11:07.799 --> 11:09.800
I've been FDNY almost 50 years.

11:09.867 --> 11:12.335
- I'll buy you a goddamn cake.
- Watch your tongue.

11:12.403 --> 11:14.971
But if the candles catch the
place on fire, you better hope

11:15.039 --> 11:16.737
there's an open house nearby.

11:16.857 --> 11:18.175
- Get him out of here.
- Come on, let's go.

11:18.242 --> 11:20.243
I don't know if you heard,
Dickie, but my boys had a bunch

11:20.311 --> 11:23.380
of saves at a school for deaf
kids the other day. Yeah.

11:23.448 --> 11:27.484
They responded in their own vehicles
with no tools, no bunker gear,

11:27.552 --> 11:29.786
and they got every kid out of
there safely, just as your

11:29.854 --> 11:31.054
trucks were rolling up.

11:31.122 --> 11:32.722
Better late than never, huh?

11:33.053 --> 11:35.492
Maybe you should have that painted
on all your vehicles from now on.

11:35.560 --> 11:37.794
None of those men were authorized
to report to that call.

11:37.862 --> 11:40.864
And none of those kids were
authorized to burn to death.

11:40.932 --> 11:42.794
- Sid, get him out of here.
- Let's go.

11:42.914 --> 11:45.435
I don't know if you heard.
We also got some video.

11:45.503 --> 11:47.904
Pay attention. We shot this
ourselves 'cause there's not

11:47.972 --> 11:49.372
a lot of news crews uptown.

11:49.440 --> 11:52.309
But it's all there... My guys
responding, my guys bringing

11:52.376 --> 11:55.078
the kids out safely, your trucks
arriving in what I would not

11:55.146 --> 11:56.796
call a timely fashion.

11:57.341 --> 11:59.096
That's for you to watch and enjoy.

11:59.154 --> 12:01.885
I got other copies... for the
"Times," for the "Post,"

12:01.953 --> 12:04.688
and for the "Daily News."
And just in case what I'm hearing is true

12:04.755 --> 12:07.457
about print media being dead,
this whole footage is getting

12:07.525 --> 12:10.694
posted on Youtube. Yeah.
That's the newfangled interweb

12:10.761 --> 12:13.330
you've heard so much about.
When you go home, have one of your grandkids

12:13.397 --> 12:17.850
type in "FDNY turns deaf ear to
disabled children."

12:17.970 --> 12:18.969
See what comes up.

12:19.036 --> 12:21.821
If you think you can come in
here and push me around, pal...

12:21.849 --> 12:24.340
No, no, no... I don't think I can.

12:24.460 --> 12:26.128
I've seen this footage.

12:26.568 --> 12:27.832
I know I can..

12:30.969 --> 12:32.282
Feel that on your head, Dickie?

12:32.611 --> 12:34.244
You just got shit on again.

12:36.154 --> 12:37.278
Shalom.

12:39.519 --> 12:40.485
We'll talk.

12:50.267 --> 12:52.636
- I never thought I'd say this, kid.
- What's that?

12:52.703 --> 12:54.871
God damn, I love the Internet.

12:58.509 --> 13:00.402
Ok, guys.

13:01.412 --> 13:02.577
Rest easy.

13:03.643 --> 13:05.332
I found the porn.
It's still here.

13:05.452 --> 13:07.250
- Yeah, the gay stuff is Tommy's.
- Ha ha.

13:07.318 --> 13:08.919
Don't need trucks or gear.

13:09.264 --> 13:10.994
Damn sure can't do the
job without the porn.

13:11.114 --> 13:11.874
Let me get this straight.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.191
You've been gone for about an hour
and 15 minutes looking for the porn.

13:14.258 --> 13:14.925
At least.

13:14.992 --> 13:17.145
Ok, funny story.
Once I got to looking through it,

13:17.265 --> 13:20.447
I had to make a little pit stop and give
the old doodle dandy a yankee,

13:20.567 --> 13:21.345
if you know what I mean.

13:21.465 --> 13:22.966
Oh.
You know, I was jerkin' off.

13:23.034 --> 13:24.434
Yeah, we got it.
All right.

13:24.502 --> 13:26.102
Jeez.
Let me get this straight.

13:26.170 --> 13:27.931
Everything in the refrigerator
has turned

13:28.051 --> 13:29.439
except the potato salad?

13:29.840 --> 13:32.542
Well, kind of.
It... it tastes a little like feet.

13:32.610 --> 13:33.810
But you're still eating it.

13:33.878 --> 13:35.412
I said, "a little like feet."

13:35.479 --> 13:38.315
And you better get rid of that
smut before the chief sees it.

13:38.382 --> 13:40.917
- Hey, chief!
- Hey. How we doin'?

13:40.985 --> 13:42.586
Hey. Good. Good.

13:42.653 --> 13:44.120
Everything present and accounted for?

13:44.188 --> 13:45.288
Yes, sir.

13:45.356 --> 13:48.767
Boy, I'm telling you, I never
thought we'd be back here again.

13:48.887 --> 13:50.026
No, neither did we, huh?

13:50.094 --> 13:51.094
What the hell.

13:51.162 --> 13:52.034
Yeah.

13:52.430 --> 13:54.197
- Here we are.
- All right, chief.

13:54.519 --> 13:55.826
No thanks to you.

13:59.268 --> 14:00.125
What did you say?

14:02.084 --> 14:03.173
Nothin'.

14:03.241 --> 14:06.140
No, no, big man.
Let's hear it...

14:06.466 --> 14:08.245
Nice and loud so everybody can hear.

14:08.312 --> 14:09.397
Ok.

14:10.485 --> 14:11.927
I said, "no thanks to you."

14:13.628 --> 14:16.720
I thought that's what you said.
You little turd.

14:16.787 --> 14:19.389
How dare you talk to me like that.
Don't you ever, ever talk to me...

14:19.457 --> 14:21.057
- Hey, man!
- Stay out of this, Gavin.

14:21.125 --> 14:22.192
Between me and the kid.

14:22.260 --> 14:23.326
I'm sorry, all right?

14:23.394 --> 14:24.855
I don't give a shit what you are.

14:25.427 --> 14:28.515
All my years of service, I gotta put up
with garbage like that, like you?

14:29.182 --> 14:31.719
Stack my medals up, they stand
taller than you, asshole.

14:32.467 --> 14:34.467
What gives you the right to mouth
off to me like that?

14:34.489 --> 14:37.173
Hey, chief, you know, we all
heard what happened downtown.

14:37.241 --> 14:37.941
Yeah.

14:38.009 --> 14:42.583
Oh, so, uh, our pal Needles hero
comes in *** this morning, huh?

14:43.209 --> 14:46.447
It's all the "hail the conquer hero"
and all that bullshit, huh?

14:46.985 --> 14:49.911
Screw the yid and kiss
the Guinea's ass. Right?

14:50.488 --> 14:51.688
What did he say?

14:51.756 --> 14:54.037
He said you forgot the
letters and the petition.

14:55.125 --> 14:56.418
That's right. I did.

14:57.194 --> 14:59.829
My fault. But it wouldn't
have done any good, anyway.

14:59.897 --> 15:01.546
Yeah, well, they probably
wouldn't have hurt.

15:02.066 --> 15:05.000
Oh, now you're the expert on
how to handle HQ? Huh, Rivera?

15:05.336 --> 15:07.203
Tell me, genius, what
would you have done?

15:07.271 --> 15:10.275
Hey, look, chief, you know, I'm actually
much more interested in what you did.

15:10.395 --> 15:12.509
All right? Or what you didn't
do, because

15:12.576 --> 15:14.311
quite honestly, it doesn't sound like
you did very much.

15:14.378 --> 15:16.664
I didn't have the chance.

15:18.582 --> 15:22.205
I wanted to work the guy... Call
in a few favors,

15:22.967 --> 15:25.622
treat him with a little respect, play it
so that all of us could

15:25.690 --> 15:27.257
walk away thinking we're winners.

15:27.325 --> 15:29.423
But no. He wouldn't give me the chance.

15:30.144 --> 15:32.266
Right away, it wants to turn it
into a confrontation...

15:32.525 --> 15:33.967
blackmail, extortion.

15:34.598 --> 15:36.723
I'm surprised he didn't
piss on the guy's desk.

15:36.843 --> 15:38.368
Whatever he did, it worked.

15:38.436 --> 15:39.602
Back in business.

15:39.670 --> 15:41.338
Oh, isn't that wonderful?

15:41.405 --> 15:42.958
We're back in business.

15:44.189 --> 15:49.019
Meanwhile, 'cause of what he did,
we have zero political clout downtown.

15:50.121 --> 15:52.782
And you can thank your pal chief Nelson.

15:53.763 --> 15:55.485
Get on the goddamn truck.

15:55.806 --> 15:57.860
Garrity, get rid of the porn cooler.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.465
Battalion.

16:21.262 --> 16:24.537
Listen up, you guys.
We have intel from the partner buildings

16:24.605 --> 16:27.841
that the landlord has sliced
this place up like a cheap salami.

16:27.961 --> 16:30.041
- So, heads-up.
- Goddamn motel no tell.

16:30.161 --> 16:31.882
- All right. Garrity, Franco...
- Yeah.

16:32.002 --> 16:33.044
Rear fire escape.

16:33.094 --> 16:35.648
Tommy, Shawn, you guys head to the basement.
Damian, you come with me.

16:35.716 --> 16:39.261
We'll do a sweep from here up.
And let's stay together inside!

16:40.486 --> 16:42.377
Fire department. Hello!

16:43.891 --> 16:44.937
What do we got here?

16:45.477 --> 16:47.468
- Rise and shine, my brother.
- What's going on?

16:47.588 --> 16:48.924
Come on. We gotta move.

16:49.044 --> 16:50.189
Why come?

16:50.309 --> 16:52.101
"Why come." Nice grammar.
Come on.

16:52.221 --> 16:53.503
Come on, man.
Let's make moves.

16:53.623 --> 16:55.408
Come on. Up the stairs.
Come on, man.

16:55.528 --> 16:57.091
- Let's go!
- Hello!

16:57.211 --> 17:00.596
FDNY! Bring out your dead!

17:00.978 --> 17:02.651
"Bring out your dead"?
What the hell does that mean?

17:02.771 --> 17:03.916
Come on. Monty Python?

17:04.036 --> 17:05.930
What the hell are they teaching
you kids in school nowadays?

17:06.050 --> 17:08.678
I don't know. How to cook crystal
meth and have unprotected sex.

17:08.798 --> 17:10.411
Oh. I'm going back to school.

17:11.090 --> 17:12.438
Ohh.

17:13.145 --> 17:14.964
- What's up?
- Listen, I'm good here.

17:15.084 --> 17:16.733
Why don't you go help Tommy
and Sean with the sweep?

17:17.019 --> 17:19.019
- You said stick together.
- And now I'm saying unstick.

17:19.138 --> 17:20.175
Go.

17:21.428 --> 17:22.460
Oh, shit. We got one, Lou.

17:22.579 --> 17:24.636
Hey. We got one,
chief, second floor.

17:25.709 --> 17:27.589
It's all right, ma'am.
We're gonna get you out of here. Ok?

17:27.709 --> 17:29.100
- My... my grandbaby.
- Where?

17:29.220 --> 17:31.304
- It's...uh...Please.
- Can you hear that?

17:32.732 --> 17:34.556
Ma'am, you gonna have
to come with me, ok?

17:36.236 --> 17:39.001
You're gonna have to carry me, boy.
My leg's busted.

17:39.545 --> 17:41.804
Yeah. All right, just give
me a minute on that, ok?

17:58.232 --> 17:59.165
Don't worry.

17:59.233 --> 18:00.648
Wait! You're still here?

18:00.768 --> 18:02.001
Yeah, yeah.
She's a little heavy.

18:02.069 --> 18:02.902
Well look who's talking.

18:02.970 --> 18:04.079
I got no baby in there, ma'am.

18:04.199 --> 18:05.805
She's in the dresser drawer!

18:05.873 --> 18:07.040
Oh, yeah. Naturally.

18:07.107 --> 18:09.576
You know, you might want to
lead with that info next time.

18:09.643 --> 18:11.611
That's ok.
Don't you worry about the baby.

18:11.679 --> 18:14.174
He's the best that
we have at finding babies.

18:45.773 --> 18:46.739
Hey, kid.

18:49.800 --> 18:51.936
Let's get you out of here, ok?

18:57.340 --> 18:59.123
Hey.

18:59.243 --> 19:00.426
Where's Damian?

19:00.494 --> 19:03.351
He and Lou are bringing one out.
Lou, what's your status?

19:03.732 --> 19:05.583
I'm still single.

19:05.703 --> 19:08.067
- We're heading home.
- Oh, God.

19:08.135 --> 19:10.903
I'm supposed to be leaning on you!
You're leaning on me,

19:10.971 --> 19:12.203
you old fat ass.

19:12.323 --> 19:15.033
I'm not fat, lady. It's... it's the pants.
Now, come on.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.709
Let's keep moving.

19:16.777 --> 19:18.244
- I got a baby!
- Hey.

19:18.312 --> 19:21.295
- All right.
- I got a baby. Huh?

19:21.415 --> 19:23.683
- I got a baby!
- You said that already.

19:23.751 --> 19:24.684
Here, careful. It's a baby.

19:24.752 --> 19:26.753
How about that, huh?
She's got your hunter's cap.

19:26.820 --> 19:29.293
She's not gonna let go. There you go.
How are you feeling?

19:30.001 --> 19:31.933
- I just saved a baby.
- Yeah.

19:32.053 --> 19:33.226
- You see that?
- I saw it.

19:33.293 --> 19:35.540
I just saved a baby.
I just saved a frickin' baby.

19:35.660 --> 19:37.463
I don't even like babies,
and I'm psyched.

19:37.531 --> 19:39.465
I know.
You stepped on my toe!

19:39.533 --> 19:40.433
You all right?

19:40.501 --> 19:41.567
On my toe.

19:41.635 --> 19:42.568
Got it, got it, got it.

19:42.636 --> 19:43.670
Uhh. Oh, thank you.

19:43.737 --> 19:44.537
You all right?

19:47.146 --> 19:49.554
Oh, yeah. Perfect...

19:50.303 --> 19:51.813
How about a roast beef sandwich?

19:52.156 --> 19:53.353
Ok, we can make that happen.

19:53.473 --> 19:56.764
Or 2 roast beef sandwiches.

19:56.884 --> 19:58.029
My God.

19:58.437 --> 19:59.457
Whoo!

20:01.955 --> 20:02.992
- Hey.
- Shh.

20:03.112 --> 20:04.724
- What?
- Lou's sleeping.

20:04.792 --> 20:06.559
Well, Lou, we can go talk
somewhere else if you want.

20:06.627 --> 20:10.239
No, stay. You know, if...
If it looks like I've stopped breathing or

20:10.359 --> 20:12.728
I'm dead, just pound
my chest really, really hard.

20:12.848 --> 20:13.667
You got it.

20:14.501 --> 20:15.868
Anyway, listen.

20:15.936 --> 20:17.670
I've been thinking about Pat.

20:17.738 --> 20:19.138
Yeah, dude. Me. Too.

20:19.206 --> 20:21.607
You know, I don't think it
worked out so well, you know?

20:21.675 --> 20:24.110
Taking him to the ballet and all
those regrets he told us about.

20:24.178 --> 20:25.740
I don't think we can do
anything about those, dude.

20:25.860 --> 20:28.869
I know, man. Oh, here's the thing.
Remember Pat was talking about, like

20:29.142 --> 20:31.172
wanting to
be remembered and all that shit?

20:31.292 --> 20:34.274
Yeah, was that before or after he
tried to piss in the fountain?

20:34.394 --> 20:35.513
Before, I think.

20:35.633 --> 20:36.789
Anyway, here's what we gotta do.

20:36.857 --> 20:38.472
We gotta convince him that he
will be remembered.

20:38.592 --> 20:40.703
And who are the people that are gonna
remember him the most, huh?

20:40.823 --> 20:41.628
Who are they?

20:44.822 --> 20:45.952
Do I get a multiple choice?

20:46.072 --> 20:49.408
No, dick. His saves...
People he saved in a fire.

20:49.703 --> 20:50.778
- Yes.
- Huh?

20:50.898 --> 20:52.038
You're brilliant, dude.

20:52.106 --> 20:54.076
I can be. I just don't try
that hard most of the time.

20:54.196 --> 20:55.287
Yeah, I know that feeling.

20:55.407 --> 20:57.028
Anyway, I got on the phone
with his last firehouse, and

20:57.148 --> 20:59.602
I got a list of some names and
addresses of some of his old saves.

20:59.722 --> 21:01.981
And tonight, we're gonna
go out, and we're gonna start

21:02.049 --> 21:04.557
the Pat Mahoney appreciation tour.

21:04.952 --> 21:07.782
That way, he knows that he'll always
be remembered long after he's gone.

21:08.408 --> 21:10.702
- You like it? - It's so nice, dude.
- What's wrong?

21:10.822 --> 21:12.024
I'm choking up.

21:12.092 --> 21:13.686
- You know why that is?
- Why?

21:13.737 --> 21:15.445
Well, I can make this a
multiple choice for you.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.731
"A," you're gay. "B," you're super
gay, like meet George Michael

21:18.799 --> 21:22.268
in a back alley gay.
Or 3, mmm, your pants are on fire

21:22.336 --> 21:23.844
filet mignon gay.

21:24.103 --> 21:26.633
Or "D," all of the above. It's your call.
See you tonight.

21:33.039 --> 21:34.250
It's "D."

21:40.732 --> 21:41.916
What's up to the probie?

21:42.036 --> 21:43.086
I gotta give you props, son.

21:43.206 --> 21:44.896
- A baby save's a big one, man.
- Thank you.

21:45.016 --> 21:47.164
Yeah. This morning, you
barely had any hair on your balls,

21:47.206 --> 21:48.439
and now you got a
full-grown beard, huh?

21:48.474 --> 21:51.284
Yeah. Well, if I'm such a big hero,
how come I still gotta polish the rig?

21:51.404 --> 21:52.223
Law of the land.

21:52.343 --> 21:53.760
Yeah, man. That's the rules of the roost.

21:53.880 --> 21:56.860
I know it sucks, but one baby save don't
change the fact that you're still a pissant,

21:56.980 --> 21:58.764
grunt-faced, lower
than turtle shit probie.

21:59.132 --> 22:00.854
- No doubt.
- All right, listen.

22:01.207 --> 22:03.303
I need some advice.
I don't know who else to turn to.

22:03.423 --> 22:04.269
About pussy?

22:04.389 --> 22:05.575
Yeah. How'd you know?

22:05.695 --> 22:07.670
Ok. Well, I mean, if you're
asking me for advice,

22:07.713 --> 22:10.049
it damn sure ain't about
quantum mechanics. Shoot.

22:10.675 --> 22:13.524
All right. Well, I'm seeing
Penny tonight, right?

22:13.644 --> 22:16.728
And it's like our third date.
And I'm just worried that if

22:16.795 --> 22:18.563
I don't make a move soon,
then, you know, she's...

22:18.631 --> 22:19.554
She's gonna think you're queer.

22:19.674 --> 22:20.820
- Exactly.
- Right.

22:21.065 --> 22:25.118
So, what do I do? What do I say to,
you know, steer things into the sack?

22:25.238 --> 22:26.193
Heh. It's easy.

22:26.472 --> 22:28.406
Hey...

22:28.439 --> 22:31.175
Listen carefully to my man
pretty Frank on this player shit.

22:31.713 --> 22:35.062
You understand what this is.
This is Luke talking to Yoda

22:35.375 --> 22:37.759
in the swamp, only it's not
about the force.

22:38.673 --> 22:41.530
It's about the pussy.
Ears wide open, son.

22:41.884 --> 22:42.809
Ok.

22:42.929 --> 22:45.407
All right, young Jedi, now, listen up.
This is the play. All right?

22:46.360 --> 22:48.693
You start off telling her
about the save. Ok?

22:48.813 --> 22:50.706
And then you segue
into something like this.

22:51.672 --> 22:54.557
So, I had that baby in my
hands, fire all around me.

22:54.677 --> 22:56.492
I'm running for the door.
And I thought to myself,

22:56.551 --> 23:00.480
"if I were to die right now, today,
would I have any regrets whatsoever?"

23:00.600 --> 23:02.072
And I could only think of one.

23:02.330 --> 23:05.043
And that would be not taking our
relationship to the next level...

23:05.449 --> 23:06.877
- Making it physical.
- Mmm.

23:06.997 --> 23:11.219
Making the connection between you
and me stronger, deeper, and more real.

23:11.339 --> 23:13.866
I know I could go to my final resting
place a happy man,

23:13.986 --> 23:15.019
with no regrets.

23:15.087 --> 23:15.687
Mmm.

23:15.754 --> 23:17.477
If you can get a little misty around
the eyes, that always helps.

23:17.597 --> 23:20.294
Next thing you know, you're
getting your lightsaber serviced.

23:21.205 --> 23:22.280
Yoda!

23:23.395 --> 23:24.402
Mm-hmm.

23:24.837 --> 23:26.457
Do I remember him?

23:26.577 --> 23:28.743
You gotta be kiddin'.

23:29.628 --> 23:33.138
Not a day goes by I don't throw
a prayer in your direction, brother.

23:34.100 --> 23:36.059
Right. You could have aimed
a little better, I guess.

23:36.780 --> 23:40.175
He's got cancer from working
down at ground zero.

23:41.114 --> 23:44.469
- Jesus. That ain't right.
- Yeah.

23:44.768 --> 23:47.516
- Can I tell you something?
- Yeah.

23:48.061 --> 23:49.695
A few days after 9/11,

23:50.647 --> 23:53.491
they start talking about
missing firemen in the paper.

23:54.267 --> 23:55.907
Pretty soon, they had a list.

23:56.709 --> 23:59.272
Every day, I'd go through that list.

23:59.735 --> 24:01.381
I'd look for your name,

24:01.767 --> 24:03.122
which I never forgot.

24:04.870 --> 24:06.900
I remember the paper
was shaking in my hands.

24:07.717 --> 24:09.322
I almost didn't want to look,

24:09.703 --> 24:12.385
hoping and praying
I wouldn't find your name there.

24:13.242 --> 24:16.630
When it wasn't, I figured you
were down there

24:17.011 --> 24:18.992
digging for the names that were.

24:20.407 --> 24:21.604
Now this.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.029
It ain't fair.

24:28.060 --> 24:29.444
No, it ain't.

24:30.429 --> 24:31.840
A bowl of soup. Come on.

24:31.960 --> 24:34.289
- No, no, thanks.
I- ... I'll have a bowl of soup.

24:34.409 --> 24:35.337
Thanks.

24:36.140 --> 24:37.150
You got cancer?

24:37.603 --> 24:38.794
No. I did, though.

24:38.914 --> 24:40.100
I'm better now.

24:41.529 --> 24:42.628
I'll give you a cup.

24:48.647 --> 24:49.914
So, like, all right.

24:49.982 --> 24:51.249
I'm in this burning room, right?

24:51.316 --> 24:54.118
And I'm holding this poor,
defenseless little baby, and

24:54.186 --> 24:55.261
there's fire all around me.

24:55.381 --> 24:58.159
There's no exit in sight.
And I'm thinking to myself,

24:59.324 --> 25:02.675
"if I die right now,
will I have any regrets?"

25:03.763 --> 25:04.893
And I realized

25:05.546 --> 25:06.617
I had only one.

25:08.767 --> 25:10.100
If I left this planet

25:10.220 --> 25:12.753
without us taking our relationship
to the next level,

25:12.873 --> 25:14.137
like, that would be...

25:14.395 --> 25:16.980
Hold up. Are you trying to say
that you want to bang me?

25:19.038 --> 25:20.262
Yeah, pretty much.

25:20.616 --> 25:22.997
God damn. There's always gotta
be some big speech. Ok.

25:23.117 --> 25:25.810
Um, why don't you tell me the
rest of whatever it was

25:25.862 --> 25:27.526
that you rehearsed
on the way back to my place.

25:28.311 --> 25:30.445
- Ok.
- Chop, chop, Keefe.

25:33.522 --> 25:35.153
All right. Let's do this.

25:36.784 --> 25:39.382
Jared Williams?
What'd you want to see him about?

25:39.502 --> 25:40.484
Uh, we're firefighters.

25:40.604 --> 25:43.820
And our buddy here saved Mr. Williams
back in February 2004.

25:43.940 --> 25:47.803
Whew. Should have let his ghetto ass burn.
I'll tell you that much.

25:48.225 --> 25:50.789
Nice. Well, is he here?
Do you know if he's around?

25:50.909 --> 25:52.191
- No, he's not.
- Ok.

25:52.311 --> 25:55.514
He's in prison... serving
4 life sentences

25:55.634 --> 25:57.542
back to back to back to back.

25:58.222 --> 26:02.263
Crackhead asshole.
Killed his lady and 3 kids

26:02.383 --> 26:04.167
right here in this house.

26:04.752 --> 26:07.506
Should have let his ass burn up.
That lady and

26:07.626 --> 26:09.300
her 3 kids still be alive today.

26:14.469 --> 26:17.602
Dude, I told you we should have
checked out these folks beforehand.

26:17.669 --> 26:20.109
It's a minor bump in the road. This
next one...it's gonna be great. Come on.

26:25.711 --> 26:28.950
That was...
Fast.

26:29.780 --> 26:30.733
Really?

26:31.726 --> 26:35.707
I think it may have taken me
longer to say, "that was fast."

26:36.415 --> 26:37.802
Yeah, I don't know.

26:37.922 --> 26:41.571
I don't know. Like, I was just
really focused on what was

26:42.088 --> 26:44.243
taking place, you know, in the moment.

26:44.529 --> 26:47.114
- Felt like at least, like...
- 12 seconds.

26:47.862 --> 26:48.926
Is that good or bad?

26:49.046 --> 26:51.837
Jesus.
Please don't tell me you're a virgin.

26:52.177 --> 26:54.903
Or please tell me you're a virgin, 'cause
that would explain you being so clueless.

26:54.936 --> 26:57.290
No, I'm not a virgin.
All right?

26:57.410 --> 26:58.467
Thank God.

27:01.681 --> 27:04.851
There was this girl...
a woman, actually...

27:05.096 --> 27:07.711
back in high school, one of my teachers,
Mrs. Turbody.

27:08.079 --> 27:09.453
Wait. So, you were molested?

27:09.855 --> 27:10.858
Repeatedly.

27:11.356 --> 27:12.504
And I enjoyed it.

27:14.109 --> 27:18.183
Ok. Uh, but was there
actual intercourse?

27:19.162 --> 27:22.266
Uh, no. No.

27:22.334 --> 27:24.864
But it was definitely headed
in that direction, and then

27:25.340 --> 27:28.089
I told my Uncle Tommy about
it, and all hell broke loose.

27:28.209 --> 27:32.172
So, just now was the first time?
That you've ever actually...

27:32.933 --> 27:33.807
Yeah.

27:36.610 --> 27:38.120
So, you're a virgin.

27:39.718 --> 27:42.228
Well, I was a minute and
12 seconds ago, yeah.

27:42.514 --> 27:45.534
I find them... I don't know how.
Ok, Keefe?

27:46.800 --> 27:50.193
I really like you. I do.
So, we're gonna pretend that

27:50.696 --> 27:52.860
the first time never happened.

27:52.980 --> 27:54.127
- Ok.
- Ok?

27:54.247 --> 27:55.721
So, the next time...

27:57.013 --> 28:00.265
We are gonna take it slowly.

28:00.772 --> 28:01.945
And you're gonna kiss me.

28:02.065 --> 28:05.578
And then you're gonna run your fingers
gently across my inner thigh.

28:05.972 --> 28:08.703
And they you're gonna
go down on me. Got it?

28:09.381 --> 28:10.878
Yeah. Got it.

28:11.790 --> 28:12.987
Where are you goin'?

28:14.119 --> 28:16.286
- What? I thought that we were gonna...
- This isn't homework.

28:16.572 --> 28:17.865
You're gonna try this right now.

28:18.422 --> 28:19.919
- Oh.
- Uh-huh.

28:20.359 --> 28:23.336
Very cool. And, um...

28:23.880 --> 28:25.880
I think it's gonna take
a little longer this time.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.199
Oh, good. 'Cause we're aiming
for anything more 12 seconds.

28:28.267 --> 28:29.221
Oh.
Heh.

28:30.990 --> 28:32.174
So, what?

28:33.515 --> 28:35.474
He wants a medal from me? Huh?

28:36.174 --> 28:40.478
Uh, he... he saved your life,
Mr. Weiss, 10 years ago when

28:40.545 --> 28:41.925
your neighbor's Christmas
tree caught on fire...

28:41.957 --> 28:42.976
You don't think I remember?

28:43.882 --> 28:45.644
Unlike you, asshole, I was there.

28:45.764 --> 28:48.066
Ok. Mr. Weiss, there's no
need to get testy.

28:48.101 --> 28:50.187
We just...You were right. We should have
checked these people out beforehand.

28:50.699 --> 28:52.522
- Um...
- This guy shows up.

28:54.693 --> 28:57.818
I tell him, "My wife's in the next room.
Get my wife."

28:58.563 --> 29:00.983
But he don't listen. No.

29:01.731 --> 29:04.497
"Someone else will get her.
She'll be fine," he says.

29:05.370 --> 29:08.753
But she wasn't fine, was she?
She was dead!

29:14.246 --> 29:17.270
52 years married at
that time, my Sophie...

29:20.352 --> 29:23.903
Dead. Because of your friend.

29:24.717 --> 29:29.201
So, I don't say, "thank you,"
I say, "spit on you!" You hear me?

29:29.554 --> 29:31.296
I'm gonna spit on you!

29:34.343 --> 29:41.086
Ok. Well, this has been great.
Norman, thank you so much.

29:41.535 --> 29:45.617
Uh, boys, I think we should...Go.

29:48.080 --> 29:51.912
Well?

29:53.627 --> 29:54.960
16 seconds.

29:55.080 --> 29:57.827
What? No. That was way
longer than 16 seconds.

29:58.109 --> 30:01.836
No. I counted from penetration on.
Total 16 seconds.

30:03.047 --> 30:04.176
Yeah, well...

30:04.829 --> 30:06.013
better than 12.

30:07.564 --> 30:09.104
30% better, actually.

30:10.168 --> 30:12.596
You know, at this rate, if we
keep going like this, like...

30:12.716 --> 30:14.787
Yeah. You'll last a whole
minute by Christmas.

30:17.264 --> 30:18.054
Yeah.

30:19.044 --> 30:20.545
That's gonna be sweet.

30:32.235 --> 30:33.460
So, that's it?

30:36.400 --> 30:37.448
Yeah.

30:41.625 --> 30:42.455
Ok.

30:43.713 --> 30:44.625
You can go now.

30:50.574 --> 30:52.906
Let's go. Up and at 'em.

31:01.335 --> 31:02.927
What? What?

31:03.975 --> 31:06.764
I was just making sure you were,
you know, that you were all right.

31:08.332 --> 31:09.992
Yeah.

31:11.924 --> 31:13.696
- I'm great.
- Ok.

31:15.716 --> 31:17.458
This isn't over because

31:17.852 --> 31:21.752
you crawled over here with your tail
tucked between your legs.

31:22.188 --> 31:25.747
It is over because I decided
it was over ages ago,

31:26.781 --> 31:28.631
when I realized

31:28.751 --> 31:32.682
that I needed something more than the
occasional crazy-ass

31:32.749 --> 31:36.852
booze-infested bonking when I
rummaged through the rubble

31:36.920 --> 31:39.318
of this bullshit relationship...

31:39.931 --> 31:43.931
which is really just a giant
goddamn series of one-night stands...

31:44.051 --> 31:49.623
and I picked out the one, maybe two,
golden nuggets that remained...

31:51.535 --> 31:53.715
I succumbed to the fact that

31:54.518 --> 31:56.123
all you ever did

31:57.375 --> 31:59.089
was disappoint me.

32:00.644 --> 32:01.412
Really?

32:01.812 --> 32:02.935
Really.

32:03.901 --> 32:05.044
Ok. How's that?

32:05.725 --> 32:06.883
You want the list?

32:07.184 --> 32:08.784
There's a list?

32:08.852 --> 32:11.515
- Yeah. I got a list a mile goddamn long.
- Oh, really?

32:11.635 --> 32:13.856
- Yeah. You want to hear that list?
- No, no. You know what? No.

32:13.924 --> 32:17.860
I do not want to hear the list, ok?
As a matter of fact, I,

32:17.928 --> 32:20.663
ok, have no interest in the list.
And I'll tell you why.

32:20.731 --> 32:23.062
Because I am approaching this...

32:24.532 --> 32:25.593
I'm bigger than this...

32:28.205 --> 32:30.437
I am bigger than this.

32:34.165 --> 32:35.403
What's on the list?

32:36.881 --> 32:37.980
You used me.

32:38.048 --> 32:39.285
Oh, please.

32:39.883 --> 32:44.895
You did. You used me to
ease your own guilt...

32:45.322 --> 32:47.990
Your guilt about Jimmy, your
guilt about the fact that

32:48.058 --> 32:50.960
your wife didn't seem to give
enough of a shit about you.

32:51.027 --> 32:53.796
You promised me that we had
something, that whatever it was

32:53.864 --> 32:56.047
we were doing was gonna lead somewhere.

32:56.374 --> 32:57.462
You used my kid

32:57.582 --> 33:00.428
to live out fantasies about
your own kid after he died.

33:00.706 --> 33:02.311
You made him into a fireman,

33:02.431 --> 33:04.673
you made him into a hero, then you
promised me that you were gonna

33:04.741 --> 33:08.091
do something to change his mind,
and then, poof.

33:09.112 --> 33:11.017
 Nothing! Nada.

33:11.047 --> 33:14.477
Zippo. Zilch. You never took me anywhere.
You never bought me anything.

33:14.858 --> 33:17.186
You never even
wondered out loud what it is

33:17.254 --> 33:21.724
that I might want, because it
was all about you, you, you,

33:21.792 --> 33:23.622
you, big nose.

33:25.195 --> 33:28.660
And let's see.
There was one more thing. Oh, yeah.

33:29.800 --> 33:31.207
The sex sucked.

33:34.026 --> 33:35.838
- The sex didn't suck. - Yeah, it did.
- No, it didn't.

33:35.906 --> 33:37.273
Yeah.
It did not. Bullshit.

33:37.340 --> 33:39.074
Sweetheart, it totally
sucked, because you would

33:39.142 --> 33:41.310
come over here drunk or to get drunk...

33:41.378 --> 33:43.442
You told me I could come
over here and drink.

33:43.562 --> 33:46.148
In a rage, and it would just
be like this slapping and

33:46.216 --> 33:47.883
- screaming at each other...
- Yeah.

33:47.951 --> 33:51.425
It would be this vicious,
wonderful, furious action.

33:52.355 --> 33:53.866
Big whoop, Tommy.

33:55.308 --> 33:57.091
You couldn't do the same thing sober.

33:58.628 --> 34:01.997
'Cause it's not just about the action.
It is about emotion

34:02.065 --> 34:06.735
and connection, and I don't even
think that you ever looked me

34:06.803 --> 34:09.581
in the eyes once when we did it.

34:10.306 --> 34:13.636
I mean, if it was like
really great sex...

34:16.980 --> 34:19.277
I wouldn't have a list now, would I?

34:21.318 --> 34:25.306
You're telling me that you have no...
feelings for me.

34:26.257 --> 34:28.791
Oh, no, I do.
I've got feelings of pity for you.

34:28.859 --> 34:30.069
Oh, bullshit.

34:30.966 --> 34:33.197
- I'm with Mickey now.
- Yeah.

34:33.318 --> 34:36.966
And he is this close to
getting Damian to change his

34:37.033 --> 34:40.469
mind about his life path.
And... No offense,

34:40.536 --> 34:44.940
but my God, he is a
fabulous kisser. Mmm.

34:50.080 --> 34:56.295
Mmm, let me just... You're telling me that...

34:58.228 --> 35:01.942
If I was to kiss you right now,
you... You wouldn't feel anything.

35:02.993 --> 35:06.046
I'm sober. You're sober.

35:07.271 --> 35:09.760
That ship doesn't even have a sail.

35:10.500 --> 35:11.698
Mm-hmm.

35:22.861 --> 35:24.276
Mmm.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.131
Bacon. See you later.

35:29.586 --> 35:30.386
Ok.

35:40.196 --> 35:42.961
Mmm.
Mm-hmm.

35:45.954 --> 35:46.936
Mmm.

35:47.003 --> 35:47.736
Oh.

35:47.804 --> 35:48.737
You're disgusting!

35:48.805 --> 35:50.072
Knock it off.

35:55.111 --> 35:58.985
Mmm.

35:59.282 --> 36:00.649
You lied, didn't you?

36:00.717 --> 36:02.551
- Yes, I did.
- Yeah. You did.

36:06.398 --> 36:08.357
Ah. Got it.

36:17.367 --> 36:18.600
All right.

36:20.614 --> 36:21.933
This is the end of it.

36:22.238 --> 36:25.174
Ok. It has to be.

36:25.241 --> 36:26.429
Ok.

36:27.577 --> 36:29.078
You gotta be shittin' me.

36:29.145 --> 36:30.579
What...Oh. No, no, no.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.615
Oh! Mickey no.
Oh, Mickey, no, no, no, no!

36:32.682 --> 36:33.916
No, no. Mick, wait. Wait.

36:34.884 --> 36:37.252
Wait. I'm trying to... Ay!
Ow, my ass!

36:38.254 --> 36:39.822
- Get off of me.
- My hand.

36:39.889 --> 36:42.658
What's happening?
What... I'm stuck in... Oh, my...

36:42.726 --> 36:43.659
There it is. Wait.

36:43.727 --> 36:45.461
Mickey? Mickey? Mickey?

36:45.528 --> 36:46.462
Heh heh heh. Ho ho ho.

36:46.529 --> 36:47.896
Hey, you're in your underwear.

36:47.964 --> 36:49.331
Where's my dress?
Where's my dress?

36:49.399 --> 36:51.033
- It's on, but it's all...
- Aah!

36:51.101 --> 36:52.568
Shit.

36:52.636 --> 36:55.357
God damn it.

36:55.805 --> 36:56.872
Who are you calling?

36:56.940 --> 36:59.642
Domino's pizza.
Who do you think I'm calling? Him.

36:59.709 --> 37:02.177
If he calls Janet or shows
up at my house, I'm dead.

37:02.245 --> 37:04.913
Hey. Hey. Why don't you think
about me for once, huh?

37:04.981 --> 37:07.816
You asshole. Why can't you think with
your brain instead of your cock?

37:07.884 --> 37:10.019
'Cause apparently, my
brain is in my cock.

37:10.086 --> 37:11.553
Yeah.

37:11.621 --> 37:12.815
Who are you calling?

37:13.423 --> 37:16.158
My vaginey, to tell her
to stay away from you.

37:16.226 --> 37:16.992
That's so funny.

37:17.060 --> 37:18.861
Was that the beep? Oh, my God.
Ok. I hope you didn't hear

37:18.928 --> 37:20.429
that, but if you heard
that, it's totally ok...

37:20.497 --> 37:23.699
Hey, Mick, you did not see what
you thought you saw. Now...

37:23.767 --> 37:25.267
Hey, you're ruining my message!

37:25.335 --> 37:26.946
Your message is making it worse.
Listen to me.

37:27.066 --> 37:28.937
Don't call Janet. Don't go to my house.

37:29.005 --> 37:31.802
We were trying to prove that we
weren't attracted to each other.

37:31.922 --> 37:34.223
- Right. Right. Which we are.
- Yes.

37:34.343 --> 37:35.825
- Not. Not.
- No..

37:35.945 --> 37:38.447
- Listen, I know it looked weird. It's...
- Oh, Mickey, please come back here...

37:38.515 --> 37:40.049
I'm telling you that it was...

37:40.116 --> 37:40.883
it was a stupid mistake.

37:40.950 --> 37:43.585
It's not what you thought you saw.
So, please call us. Don't...

37:43.653 --> 37:45.151
Just call us.

37:45.968 --> 37:48.186
Please forgive me, putty.

37:58.802 --> 37:59.727
Putty?

38:01.741 --> 38:03.572
I tot I taw a putty-tat.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.341
That's... That's cute.

38:06.771 --> 38:08.658
You couldn't let me go, could you?
You know?

38:08.696 --> 38:10.941
- I was halfway out the goddamn door...
- Shut up.

38:10.976 --> 38:12.414
And you had to push
my goddamn buttons.

38:12.482 --> 38:13.982
- Shut up!
- It's all your fault!

38:14.050 --> 38:15.918
- Go to hell!
- Guess what, sweetheart?

38:15.985 --> 38:17.253
I'm already there.

38:19.608 --> 38:20.489
Which one?

38:20.557 --> 38:21.882
Figure it out.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.062
Ah, ha!

38:28.131 --> 38:30.099
Don't you slam that door.
Don't you slam that door!

38:37.440 --> 38:39.441
All right, Patty, boy, a
couple more stops,

38:39.509 --> 38:42.111
if you can risk it. Might want to pick
up a bulletproof vest first.

38:42.178 --> 38:43.045
Yeah.

38:43.113 --> 38:46.181
We're sorry, dude. It was supposed
to be a good thing, you know?

38:46.249 --> 38:49.250
Oh, hey, guys, guys, don't worry.
This job...

38:49.652 --> 38:52.187
This job is a good thing. Ok?

38:52.255 --> 38:54.845
It don't matter if they don't get it.
Shit...

38:55.635 --> 38:59.862
Best days of my life were spent running
in the burning shitholes, uptown,

38:59.929 --> 39:01.764
downtown, Bronx, Brooklyn.

39:01.831 --> 39:02.464
Yeah.

39:02.532 --> 39:04.599
Most times, anyplace you are,
it's...

39:05.266 --> 39:09.537
people who are in some kind of dire
straits you gotta go in and get, you know?

39:10.408 --> 39:13.281
The poor, the messed-up drunks, people
down on their luck.

39:13.401 --> 39:16.778
You don't get to pick who you save, right?

39:22.051 --> 39:23.252
Comes with the territory.

39:23.319 --> 39:27.876
I mean, if saves had to fill out
goddamn personality tests

39:27.996 --> 39:31.960
before we ran in to grab 'em, we'd
probably let most of 'em fry.

39:32.829 --> 39:34.612
Well, we're sorry. You know?

39:36.796 --> 39:39.334
Dude, I still think it was a
good idea, though, you know?

39:39.402 --> 39:43.071
Like, if I were, like, dying, I would
totally want you to do this for me.

39:43.139 --> 39:46.281
You know, that's a little morbid, but at least
I'd check everybody out next time.

39:46.401 --> 39:47.520
Yeah, you gotta, dude.

39:47.751 --> 39:48.662
Hey, pal, what do you think, man?

39:48.782 --> 39:51.233
We should stop for a brew or something
before we head back to the hospital, huh?

39:51.954 --> 39:52.757
Patty?

39:55.321 --> 39:56.192
Pat?

39:56.452 --> 39:57.648
Hey, Pat?

39:58.822 --> 39:59.947
Pat?

40:13.892 --> 40:16.004
Hello? Hey.

40:16.072 --> 40:17.777
- Hey, daddy.
- Hi.

40:18.107 --> 40:19.641
- How was your day?
- Good.

40:19.709 --> 40:21.376
- Good.
- What's goin' on?

40:21.444 --> 40:23.152
Uh, nothing.
Just making dinner.

40:23.272 --> 40:24.613
- Where's your mother?
- Hi.

40:24.681 --> 40:26.715
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:26.783 --> 40:28.617
- Hi.
- Mmm. How was your day?

40:28.685 --> 40:30.118
- Good.
- Yeah?

40:30.186 --> 40:32.054
Yeah. How was... How's
everything here?

40:32.121 --> 40:33.121
Good.

40:33.189 --> 40:34.323
Good.

40:34.390 --> 40:35.452
So, what's happening?

40:36.092 --> 40:37.693
Just cooking dinner.

40:37.760 --> 40:40.162
Cool.

40:40.864 --> 40:44.900
So, uh, everything's, uh...
Looks good.

40:44.968 --> 40:46.902
Thank you. Sit, sit, sit.

40:46.970 --> 40:48.203
We made you this dinner.

40:48.271 --> 40:52.207
- Ok. I am ready for...
- Good.

40:52.275 --> 40:53.270
Dinner.

40:56.212 --> 41:00.782
So, uh...
Anybody, um, call?

41:00.850 --> 41:01.884
Uh, nope.

41:01.951 --> 41:02.894
Nobody called?

41:03.987 --> 41:07.871
Cool. Where's, uh, Katy?

41:07.991 --> 41:10.145
She's in her bedroom doing homework.

41:12.141 --> 41:13.929
Would you please go
get her for dinner?

41:13.997 --> 41:15.864
Yep.

41:15.932 --> 41:17.532
Katy, dinner!

41:17.857 --> 41:19.067
I could have done that.

41:19.135 --> 41:21.136
All righty.

41:21.204 --> 41:23.005
This looks great.

41:28.578 --> 41:29.825
Hey, cuz.

41:32.582 --> 41:33.805
Hey.

41:38.288 --> 41:39.425
What's up?

41:41.524 --> 41:43.392
Come on, Uncle Mickey. Sit down.
