FILM 1

01:08.880 --> 01:13.280
<i>You say,</i>
<i>“For as long as I’ve been conscious.”</i>

01:13.360 --> 01:15.480
<i>But this is not true.</i>

01:15.560 --> 01:20.680
<i>Rather, you should say,</i>
<i>“For as long as I have been unconscious.”</i>

01:23.360 --> 01:25.000
<i>I promised you.</i>

01:28.440 --> 01:29.840
<i>Do you feel it?</i> <i>I love you.</i>

01:53.040 --> 01:56.000
So, Esenya Andreyevna, shall we begin? -I’m ready. Where do I start?
-With a blank page.

02:01.960 --> 02:03.840
Why did you become a detective?

02:04.880 --> 02:06.680
This seems like an odd choice--

02:08.360 --> 02:10.080
For someone with your looks.

02:12.800 --> 02:14.560
Looks can be deceiving.

02:15.080 --> 02:16.600
Still, what was it?

02:28.520 --> 02:35.240
MOSCOW / 1999

03:51.000 --> 03:55.440
<i>When I was seven years old,</i>
<i>my mother was murdered.</i>

03:59.760 --> 04:01.640
<i>They never found the killer.</i>

04:03.320 --> 04:05.560
<i>I grew up, and I swore…</i>

04:06.680 --> 04:08.240
<i>that I would find him.</i>

04:08.320 --> 04:12.400
MOSCOW / 2015

04:14.360 --> 04:16.480
FAREWELL, GRADUATES!

04:16.560 --> 04:18.279
Dear graduates!

04:19.320 --> 04:23.000
You are now degreed legal professionals!

04:24.160 --> 04:25.920
And with some final words of wisdom,

04:26.000 --> 04:31.880
Ministry of Justice Senior Counselor
Andrei Sergeyevich Steklov!

04:36.720 --> 04:39.000
Hello! Let’s set aside rank for a minute.

04:40.120 --> 04:45.440
You know that today my daughter is also
setting out on her own journey.

04:46.280 --> 04:47.800
Good luck, Esenya.

04:49.320 --> 04:50.680
And good luck to you all.

04:52.240 --> 04:54.520
I don’t know what’s in store for you.

04:55.400 --> 04:57.440
Life has many different paths.

04:58.080 --> 05:02.280
I don’t even know where she’s going,
even though I see her more than you.

05:03.280 --> 05:04.880
But just remember this.

05:06.280 --> 05:09.480
If you can’t summon up the courage
to take an important step,

05:10.080 --> 05:14.760
or, on the contrary, you’re being pushed
to take a reckless misstep,

05:14.840 --> 05:16.400
you can turn to me.

05:17.640 --> 05:20.800
I’ll hear out each one of you
with as much care as I would her.

05:21.520 --> 05:23.160
Perhaps even with more care,

05:23.880 --> 05:26.120
because sometimes she talks a lot.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.000
So I’ll do whatever I can for you.
We’re colleagues now.

05:33.560 --> 05:35.200
Congratulations! Go celebrate!

05:37.520 --> 05:40.200
I hate you.

06:02.840 --> 06:04.880
What a pleasant surprise.

06:05.480 --> 06:08.840
-I wanted to do something nice.
-And prove that you’re in control?

06:12.720 --> 06:15.320
I’m not going to St. Petersburg
to work for the prosecutor.

06:15.840 --> 06:17.000
May I ask why?

06:17.080 --> 06:20.080
Because I’m sick of only being known
as your daughter.

06:20.160 --> 06:21.680
You don’t like being my daughter?

06:21.760 --> 06:24.640
I do, at home. But at work,
I want people to know me for who I am.

06:28.400 --> 06:29.200
What is it?

06:30.240 --> 06:32.360
Your mom wanted a son.

06:32.440 --> 06:34.440
That’s why you’re so headstrong.

06:35.400 --> 06:37.320
What’s wrong with St. Petersburg?

06:37.920 --> 06:39.480
Remember, you used to say,

06:40.400 --> 06:41.920
“A prosecutor works with shadows.

06:42.000 --> 06:44.400
A detective
works with those who cast them.”

06:44.840 --> 06:47.360
I don’t want to work with shadows. I don’t want to just sit on my butt.

06:50.040 --> 06:51.920
I want to find out who killed Mom.

06:52.000 --> 06:53.480
So that’s what it’s all about.

06:53.560 --> 06:56.080
You promised, remember?
Have you found him?

06:56.880 --> 06:59.520
-He’s been dead for a long time.
-How do you know?

06:59.600 --> 07:01.640
Did you see the body?
Do you know his name?

07:01.720 --> 07:03.720
-You just gave up.
-That’s enough.

07:04.880 --> 07:07.280
Call them.
Tel them thank you, but no thanks.

08:13.960 --> 08:18.520
Esenya Andreyevna,
when was the first time you met Meglin?

08:30.840 --> 08:32.320
GRADUATES!

08:46.160 --> 08:48.720
Senya! Let’s go dance!

08:49.320 --> 08:50.840
Sasha, I didn’t know you dance.

08:54.560 --> 08:55.440
I’m not bad.

08:56.240 --> 08:59.440
-Have you been drinking?
-Just a little.

08:59.520 --> 09:02.800
-And I haven’t. Would you get me a drink?
-No problem.

09:02.880 --> 09:04.480
Just don’t move, okay? -I’m not moving.
-Wait here.

09:13.680 --> 09:15.200
Esenya!

09:21.400 --> 09:23.160
-Hey!
-Hey!

09:23.240 --> 09:25.760
-How are you?
-Good. And you?

09:25.840 --> 09:28.040
Not so good. I’m bored.

09:28.120 --> 09:31.400
Come on!
Look at all the girls in their dresses!

09:32.560 --> 09:33.760
And panties.

09:35.120 --> 09:37.160
-And you?
-Me what?

09:37.240 --> 09:38.920
-Are you wearing panties?
-Zhenya!

09:50.840 --> 09:52.240
I’ll leave you two alone.

10:13.760 --> 10:15.360
May I borrow your mascara?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.120
I don’t think I have much of a neck.

10:29.200 --> 10:30.800
It’s nothing like yours.

10:31.600 --> 10:33.760
At least there’s no need
to worry about jewelry.

10:33.840 --> 10:36.320
-That’s what you worry about?
-I worry about a lot of things.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.200
I envy people.

10:39.800 --> 10:42.480
Anulya,
have you ever seen my elephant ears?

10:43.560 --> 10:46.800
No, really. I’ve always envied you.

10:47.800 --> 10:50.920
I’ve envied your neck and your legs.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.160
And the jewelry.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.680
-Aren’t you forgetting something?
-I’m serious.

10:58.280 --> 11:00.960
And your clothing is always so…
eye-catching,

11:01.040 --> 11:02.640
but it’s obviously expensive.

11:03.280 --> 11:07.160
You have both taste and means.
I’ve never had that.

11:09.320 --> 11:12.040
But I’m young! I’ll make money.

11:12.120 --> 11:14.360
-I’m a legal professional now, right?
-Of course. And your neck is gorgeous.

11:17.800 --> 11:20.320
And no one in our class
has eyes like yours.

11:20.720 --> 11:24.640
And jewelry is a dangerous thing.
Men use it to buy us.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.840
-Have you ever had any offers?
-To monetize myself?

11:28.400 --> 11:30.000
A couple of times.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.120
I want all the dirty details!

11:33.720 --> 11:35.040
He gave me a necklace.

11:35.120 --> 11:37.000
And then he said,
“Let’s go to Seychelles.”

11:37.080 --> 11:37.880
And you?

11:37.960 --> 11:41.160
And I said, “I’m not going with you
because you’re a loser.” Girls! Zhenya is just amazing!

11:46.600 --> 11:49.520
-Liz, are you wearing panties?
-Are you?

11:50.560 --> 11:52.160
I am.

11:55.960 --> 11:58.160
Does a new life really begin tomorrow? -What is it gonna be like?
-Full.

12:02.640 --> 12:05.560
But what it’s gonna be full of--
not a damn clue.

12:29.920 --> 12:32.080
Gross. What’s on your mind?

12:32.680 --> 12:35.000
-What’s it to you?
-What do you mean?

12:35.080 --> 12:37.560
Who knows when we’ll see each other again!
How about some wine!

12:37.640 --> 12:39.520
I’m wondering what’s next.

12:39.600 --> 12:41.640
There’s nothing to think about.
It’s all written out.

12:41.720 --> 12:42.440
Where?

12:43.800 --> 12:46.920
On everyone’s forehead.
What do you see on mine?

12:51.960 --> 12:54.560
-Bad handwriting.
-Come on, it’s right there!

12:54.640 --> 12:56.920
It clearly says “I will sting.”

12:57.520 --> 13:00.760
Sting what-- human hearts with verbs?

13:00.840 --> 13:03.400
No! Verbs describe actions.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.840
To work, to plow, to sweat.
That’s not cool.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.920
Interjections-- they’re cool.

13:13.600 --> 13:14.800
I get it.

13:16.480 --> 13:18.720
What do you see on my forehead?

13:28.240 --> 13:31.280
You’ll get married. It won’t work out.

13:32.400 --> 13:34.600
You’ll have willpower. He won’t.

13:37.000 --> 13:38.400
You’ll get a divorce.

13:38.640 --> 13:40.560
You’ll get married again.

13:41.160 --> 13:43.920
You’ll get a divorce again. Same story.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.120
You’ll quit this marrying hobby.

13:48.760 --> 13:50.640
You’ll find solace in work.

13:50.720 --> 13:53.760
You’ll become a lawyer in Yaroslavl.

13:53.840 --> 13:55.560
You’ll be making good money.

13:56.200 --> 13:57.400
You’ll buy a pair of earrings. That’s it!

14:08.360 --> 14:10.240
Move over! Give me some water!

14:20.080 --> 14:22.200
Come on! Get him!

14:23.200 --> 14:25.240
Vitalya, come on!

14:27.160 --> 14:29.800
Come on, Vitalya, come on!

14:30.560 --> 14:31.960
Come on!

15:07.560 --> 15:11.640
God knows what you’ll think of me,
but, oh, well.

15:12.360 --> 15:15.200
For once,
I should’ve done what they do in movies.

15:15.280 --> 15:18.000
I should have thrown this out
in the trash.

15:18.400 --> 15:19.280
I just can’t.

15:20.640 --> 15:21.720
Are you talking to me?

15:30.160 --> 15:31.960
Living crystals.

15:33.200 --> 15:36.880
Every one of them is different.
Gold, platinum.

15:37.600 --> 15:39.240
It’s beautiful.

15:39.320 --> 15:40.720
It’s German.

15:43.520 --> 15:46.200
When Germans do something,
they do it right.

15:48.800 --> 15:52.280
I wanted to give it to her today
and fly out together tomorrow.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.680
To Germany.

15:55.280 --> 15:58.520
Then she says,
“Thank you, Yuri Sergeyevich.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.960
But I can’t accept this. Please don’t.”

16:07.800 --> 16:10.960
At first I thought she was being shy.

16:11.040 --> 16:14.000
Her family isn’t rich.
She’s just not used to this.

16:16.440 --> 16:17.640
That wasn’t it. She met someone else.

16:23.280 --> 16:26.160
Tall, young, handsome.

16:28.880 --> 16:30.480
I got upset at first.

16:31.320 --> 16:33.960
Then I thought,
“Why should I ruin the night for someone--

16:35.600 --> 16:38.680
for someone I feel this way about.”

16:39.440 --> 16:42.280
How is she to blame?
She only told me how she felt.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.120
I’m just a fool with a necklace.

16:47.080 --> 16:50.720
So I just came out here to get some air.

16:50.800 --> 16:52.800
I’ve been here for about 40 minutes.

16:53.600 --> 16:57.280
I open the box, look at the necklace,
and I can’t throw it away.

16:57.960 --> 17:01.200
How can anyone throw away
something so beautiful?

17:07.800 --> 17:09.400
You know what?

17:11.359 --> 17:15.440
I don’t need anything from you,
not even your name.

17:15.520 --> 17:16.800
Please, take this.

17:16.880 --> 17:18.599
No! No!

17:18.680 --> 17:22.040
If you don’t like it, throw it away.
I can’t do it.

17:22.119 --> 17:26.160
Please take it. It’s from the heart.
Please.

17:32.160 --> 17:33.800
It’s heavy.

17:42.760 --> 17:44.080
Living crystals.

19:03.840 --> 19:05.040
Stay put.

19:05.120 --> 19:07.640
I haven’t given the order.
I can’t see him.

19:15.560 --> 19:16.960
I want you.

19:21.000 --> 19:23.560
What are you doing?
I can’t do it like this.

19:23.640 --> 19:24.840
What?

19:25.720 --> 19:29.160
Do you… need to get ready or something?

19:29.240 --> 19:30.240
Something like that.

19:32.920 --> 19:35.920
Are you, you know…

19:36.920 --> 19:38.480
“You know” what?

19:39.200 --> 19:40.800
Are you a woman yet?

19:40.880 --> 19:42.440
So what if I’m not?

19:42.520 --> 19:45.120
Does the constitution say
that we all have to fuck?

19:45.200 --> 19:46.880
You’re right.

19:49.800 --> 19:51.880
-Me neither.
-Not a woman?

20:42.320 --> 20:44.520
I’ve been with women. I have.

20:48.440 --> 20:52.560
Sanya, you haven’t been with me.
Honestly, I don’t think you ever will.

20:53.200 --> 20:54.400
I don’t get it.

20:55.280 --> 20:56.600
Don’t you like me?

20:57.360 --> 20:59.480
-I do.
-So what’s the problem?

20:59.560 --> 21:01.640
You’re too… good.

21:03.840 --> 21:05.600
I don’t even know if I deserve you. You do, you do!

21:08.040 --> 21:09.760
Esenya, of course you do.

21:10.560 --> 21:11.760
You do.

21:42.840 --> 21:45.080
-Let’s go to work!
-Copy that!

21:46.400 --> 21:47.720
Are you done?

22:10.880 --> 22:12.320
Let’s go!

22:13.280 --> 22:14.480
POLICE

23:17.160 --> 23:18.760
Did you show them?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.240
You did it.

23:22.280 --> 23:23.720
Did you show them?

23:23.800 --> 23:25.480
You showed them, didn’t you?

23:25.560 --> 23:27.960
-I showed them!
-Well done.

23:37.320 --> 23:39.360
She goes like this,
and you go like that, right?

23:40.880 --> 23:44.040
Yes!
She goes like this, and I go like that!

23:44.120 --> 23:46.960
Well done! So, you showed them, right?

23:47.040 --> 23:48.440
-I showed them!
-You did great.

23:48.520 --> 23:50.480
-You’re just tired, right?
-Yes.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.720
-Are you tired?
-I’m tired.

23:56.320 --> 23:59.680
It’s okay.
We’ll talk, and then you’ll go to jail.

23:59.760 --> 24:00.760
Okay?

24:01.360 --> 24:02.720
It’s okay. Stop crying.

24:02.800 --> 24:07.400
Tell me, those deadly earrings
this weekend, and the necklace--

24:07.480 --> 24:09.480
-did you make them all yourself?
-By myself.

24:09.560 --> 24:12.440
Good job. You’ve done such a good job.

24:12.520 --> 24:15.520
Tell me, and this guy, what’s he like?

24:16.320 --> 24:17.240
What guy?

24:17.320 --> 24:21.440
The one who told you what to say,
what to say to the girls.

24:21.520 --> 24:24.160
He did such a good job. You both did.

24:24.240 --> 24:27.160
He’s done a good job, and so have you.

24:27.240 --> 24:28.640
What’s he like?

24:30.080 --> 24:30.880
He’s handsome.

24:31.680 --> 24:33.560
You’re handsome too. You are.

24:34.280 --> 24:36.120
What’s his name?

24:36.200 --> 24:37.760
“You won’t catch me.”

24:39.320 --> 24:42.000
He said that was his name.
“You won’t catch me.”

24:42.080 --> 24:43.720
He said you’d be asking.

24:43.800 --> 24:45.800
Yep, that’s his name.

24:47.280 --> 24:49.360
That’s a good name. It’s unique.

24:51.720 --> 24:53.680
Listen, can you do me a favor?

24:53.760 --> 24:55.640
I just can’t get around to it.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.520
You seem to be good with your hands.
Will you help?

24:58.600 --> 25:00.640
-No problem.
-I’ll come visit you in jail.

25:00.720 --> 25:01.840
-Sounds good?
-Deal.

25:01.920 --> 25:03.480
-Take him.
-No problem.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.680
-Coming through!
-Coming through!

25:18.400 --> 25:20.400
“You won’t catch me.”

25:35.400 --> 25:37.040
Keep your hands off me!

25:37.120 --> 25:38.320
Keep your hands off me!

25:38.400 --> 25:39.800
What’s wrong with you?

25:39.880 --> 25:41.760
Anya was just murdered, and you--

25:41.840 --> 25:43.280
Screw you!

25:43.360 --> 25:46.120
How noble! You’re going to nobly
cover your ass your whole life!

25:47.120 --> 25:49.480
-I said keep your hands off!
-Calm down.

25:49.560 --> 25:52.680
You wanna lose your stars?
Friggin’ legal professionals!

25:53.520 --> 25:56.040
Future fat asses of Russia!

25:56.320 --> 25:58.600
You’ll be pushing paper your entire lives!

25:58.680 --> 26:02.280
What are you gonna be pushing around--
whatever your daddy-general lets you?

26:02.360 --> 26:06.040
I’d rather be shoveling shit
than prosecutor’s papers!

26:07.400 --> 26:09.120
I’ll be like Meglin!

26:09.200 --> 26:12.760
He cracked him in just two minutes!
All it took was psychology!

26:13.360 --> 26:16.200
You’d be looking for him for five years,
you morons!

26:16.280 --> 26:17.640
Listen.

26:17.720 --> 26:20.280
My house is empty. Everyone’s out of town.

26:20.360 --> 26:21.680
Get away from me!

26:21.760 --> 26:24.480
If you want, we can go to my place.

27:19.240 --> 27:22.440
-Help yourself.
-I’m fine, thank you.

27:25.760 --> 27:26.960
You’re welcome.

27:29.440 --> 27:31.320
Anyone would have done the same.

27:32.240 --> 27:34.080
If you don’t want it, all the better.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.360
Or worse.

27:38.440 --> 27:39.760
I’m a horrible person.

27:41.480 --> 27:42.480
Why?

27:44.360 --> 27:46.760
I agree. I’m just curious why.

27:50.840 --> 27:53.280
I was having a good time, and I forgot.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.000
About Anulya.

27:56.920 --> 27:58.600
We were friends for four years.

27:59.320 --> 28:02.680
Then some scum killed her,
and I’m here enjoying myself.

28:03.280 --> 28:04.680
It’s not like you killed her.

28:05.280 --> 28:08.880
Besides, justice has been served. Hurrah.

28:14.440 --> 28:16.960
-He got him fast.
-Who’s “he?”

28:17.760 --> 28:18.960
Meglin.

28:19.920 --> 28:24.640
I could have learned more from him
than I did at that freaking university.

28:29.440 --> 28:30.920
Here you go.

28:32.840 --> 28:35.120
Are you sure he’s the one
who tracked him down?

28:36.400 --> 28:39.680
Yes, my dad told me.
This was the third murder at a graduation.

28:47.960 --> 28:49.440
Cases that--

28:51.240 --> 28:53.080
that make others pee their pants

28:53.160 --> 28:55.040
are something only Meglin can handle.

28:55.640 --> 28:57.280
Is he an expert on maniacs?

28:58.480 --> 28:59.680
An expert--

29:01.560 --> 29:04.840
Half the country are experts,
but there’s only one Meglin.

29:06.080 --> 29:07.720
What’s so special about him?

29:08.360 --> 29:11.040
His clearance rate is 80%.

29:11.120 --> 29:13.720
No one knows how he finds them.

29:15.880 --> 29:18.000
On paper, he’s just an ordinary major.

29:21.400 --> 29:22.600
In reality…

29:23.760 --> 29:26.280
he couldn’t care less
about the cops or the FSB.

29:29.720 --> 29:32.280
He kicks open generals’ doors
with his boot.

29:33.080 --> 29:34.800
Are you talking about your father?

29:35.800 --> 29:37.080
And yours.

29:38.720 --> 29:41.960
My dad says
that he doesn’t report to anyone.

29:42.680 --> 29:47.040
He has a personnel file, but it’s empty.

29:47.640 --> 29:51.400
No résumé, no pictures, no biography--
not a damn thing.

29:53.320 --> 29:55.320
So how do I find Meglin?

29:59.640 --> 30:00.840
You can’t.

30:01.640 --> 30:03.560
He just shows up wherever he wants…

30:04.800 --> 30:07.080
and suddenly
a maniac floats up to the surface.

30:08.400 --> 30:09.720
Does he kill them?

30:11.120 --> 30:14.960
Well, almost. He catches them…

30:18.040 --> 30:19.640
like butterflies with a net.

30:21.920 --> 30:23.920
He’s got some kind of method.

30:25.400 --> 30:28.520
I ask my dad, “What’s his method?”

30:29.960 --> 30:31.360
No one knows…

30:34.120 --> 30:35.320
the method.

30:37.720 --> 30:40.080
Anulya never liked you.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.840
She’d say, on the outside, you’re okay.

30:46.520 --> 30:47.720
But on the inside…

30:48.840 --> 30:50.560
you’re empty.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.280
Not much to the outside either.

31:01.040 --> 31:02.480
What do you think?

31:03.320 --> 31:05.200
I don’t think about you, Zhenya.

31:22.240 --> 31:23.560
Do you have a pencil?

31:25.560 --> 31:28.960
-I almost hesitate to ask what for?
-To hold my hair up.

31:32.680 --> 31:34.920
Ask Iosif Vissarionovich.

31:40.280 --> 31:42.080
Where are you off to?

31:42.160 --> 31:44.240
I’m gonna go. We’re done, right?

31:46.560 --> 31:47.880
I get it.

31:47.960 --> 31:50.600
To see your melancholy knight.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.520
Sasha’s good. And he has a soul.

31:59.800 --> 32:01.000
And I don’t have one?

32:02.320 --> 32:04.920
You have a penis instead of a soul,
Zhenya.

32:06.280 --> 32:07.480
Bye.

32:11.520 --> 32:13.000
Cheers, Iosif Vissarionovich.

32:21.000 --> 32:27.120
TWO DAYS LATER

32:56.880 --> 32:58.560
Oh, God!

33:00.280 --> 33:02.760
My beautiful girl!

33:11.920 --> 33:13.960
My baby girl!

33:14.040 --> 33:15.800
My poor girl!

33:18.240 --> 33:20.400
You left us too soon!

33:20.480 --> 33:21.920
No!

33:31.680 --> 33:33.960
No! No!

33:34.600 --> 33:36.400
How could this happen?

33:38.760 --> 33:39.960
No! No!

34:42.000 --> 34:44.080
…HORRIFIC MURDERS… OF YOUNG BOYS…

35:04.480 --> 35:08.960
FSB ARCHIVES

35:35.000 --> 35:37.120
-Hi, Esenya.
-Hello.

35:37.880 --> 35:41.200
I heard about your graduation party.
I’m speechless.

35:41.600 --> 35:45.040
-I can’t even get my head around this.
-Everyone’s shocked.

35:45.120 --> 35:46.840
You and Anya were friends.

35:47.440 --> 35:50.160
Her parents must be devastated.
I can’t even imagine.

35:50.600 --> 35:52.080
The funeral was yesterday.

35:54.040 --> 35:57.120
Well, life goes on. Stay strong.

35:58.200 --> 36:01.000
-What do you need?
-Case files. Here’s the list.

36:08.880 --> 36:13.320
Those were… Major Meglin’s cases.

36:13.400 --> 36:16.080
I’m actually writing a paper
on his method.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.800
Those files are sealed.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.280
-Does your father know?
-Of course he does.

36:21.720 --> 36:23.720
He said to sign them out under his name.

36:24.400 --> 36:26.800
I’m not making copies.
I’ll just read them.

36:56.160 --> 36:57.360
Hi.

36:57.960 --> 36:59.960
-Why are you here?
-Why are you?

37:00.960 --> 37:03.600
I’m actually applying to graduate school.

37:03.680 --> 37:05.400
-You too?
-No!

37:07.400 --> 37:08.600
I mean yes.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.960
This is my classmate.
He’s also applying to graduate school.

37:14.040 --> 37:16.520
Sorry, Esenya.
The files have been checked out.

37:17.080 --> 37:20.400
-What do you mean? Who has them?
-I can’t tell you that.

37:22.960 --> 37:24.000
Okay then.

37:24.080 --> 37:26.360
-Good-bye, Elena Vasilievna.
-Good-bye.

37:27.120 --> 37:29.280
-Esenya, do you want to--
-Bye, Sasha.

37:29.840 --> 37:31.320
…do something tonight?

37:33.560 --> 37:34.760
Hello.

37:59.760 --> 38:02.560
-Hi, Dad.
-<i>Hi.</i>

38:03.280 --> 38:04.520
What are you doing?

38:05.800 --> 38:08.760
-Not much yet.
-<i>I see.</i>

38:08.840 --> 38:11.000
<i>I have a favor to ask.</i>

38:11.720 --> 38:15.240
Don’t check out sealed files
from the archives under my name.

38:15.320 --> 38:17.080
<i>Is that clear?</i>

38:19.120 --> 38:22.200
Elena Vasilievna ratted me out. Well done.

38:22.840 --> 38:25.960
-<i>Why do you need Meglin’s case files?</i>
-I just need them.

38:27.920 --> 38:29.120
I see.

38:29.760 --> 38:32.640
I’m going to repeat the question. Why?

38:35.400 --> 38:37.680
I want to work for him.

38:38.320 --> 38:40.560
-<i>Out of the question.</i>
-Why?

38:43.360 --> 38:45.880
-I have a meeting. We’ll talk at home.
-I can’t.

38:45.960 --> 38:48.160
I also have a meeting. Bye.

39:07.680 --> 39:09.600
Ivan Mikhalich, greetings.

39:11.120 --> 39:13.000
Thank you for your prayers.

39:14.160 --> 39:15.760
Listen, about Esenya--

39:18.320 --> 39:21.480
I’m very grateful to you,
but it’s not going to work out.

39:23.080 --> 39:25.080
No, she does want to. It’s just…

39:25.160 --> 39:27.680
The St. Petersburg weather
affects her badly.

39:28.280 --> 39:29.800
She’s allergic to everything.

39:32.080 --> 39:36.480
Listen, can we figure something out later?

40:00.360 --> 40:02.800
INVESTIGATIVE COMMITTEE

40:09.280 --> 40:12.440
Andrei Sergeyevich, we’re waiting
for Dolgov from the DA’s office and…

40:12.520 --> 40:13.800
the other one.

40:13.880 --> 40:15.680
They’re almost here. We’ll start soon.

40:15.760 --> 40:17.000
Good.

40:19.400 --> 40:20.600
Excuse me.

40:22.640 --> 40:25.120
I see your meeting is in full swing.

40:25.840 --> 40:27.920
We agreed to decide everything at home.

40:29.880 --> 40:31.480
I’ve already decided.

40:32.320 --> 40:34.320
I want to train under Meglin.

40:37.200 --> 40:38.920
What do you know about him?

40:40.080 --> 40:41.680
I know he’s the best.

40:44.040 --> 40:47.000
Have you ever thought that if there’s
so little that’s known about a person,

40:47.080 --> 40:48.680
it’s for a reason?

40:50.320 --> 40:53.280
He picked out Anya’s killer
in five minutes.

40:53.960 --> 40:56.400
I want to work with him, and you know why.

40:57.000 --> 40:58.600
I said we were done talking about it.

41:01.200 --> 41:02.680
What if he’s alive?

41:03.760 --> 41:07.280
What if he’s still out there.
Doesn’t that bother you?

41:07.360 --> 41:11.240
-You can’t live for revenge.
-This isn’t revenge. This is justice.

41:11.840 --> 41:13.720
Listen to me for once.

41:14.360 --> 41:16.880
He’s never had anyone train under him,

41:16.960 --> 41:19.080
especially a brat fresh out of college.

41:20.080 --> 41:23.120
He turned away detectives
who had worked dozens of cases.

41:23.640 --> 41:25.880
Meglin works alone. Period.

41:28.760 --> 41:31.840
You don’t want to go to St. Petersburg?
Fine.

41:35.760 --> 41:37.880
You want to get dirty? No problem!

41:38.320 --> 41:42.320
There’s a spot in Homicide in Novosibirsk.
A detective trainee.

41:42.400 --> 41:44.520
Siberia. A real job.

41:44.600 --> 41:46.920
The flight is tomorrow. Think about it.

41:47.000 --> 41:49.360
I actually do have a meeting right now.

41:49.440 --> 41:51.360
Andrei Sergeyevich, Meglin’s here.

42:17.160 --> 42:18.520
Hello.

42:21.400 --> 42:23.160
I’m Esenya Steklova.

42:25.480 --> 42:28.280
I just graduated from law school,
with honors.

42:30.280 --> 42:31.880
Will you take me as a trainee?

42:33.720 --> 42:35.120
A trainee?

42:35.800 --> 42:37.000
Yes.

42:41.720 --> 42:43.320
Okay.

42:44.880 --> 42:47.000
Can I get your phone number
so I can call--

42:47.080 --> 42:48.480
I don’t have a phone.

43:04.560 --> 43:07.600
-Andrei Sergeyevich, everyone’s here.
-All right. Just like that? And you weren’t surprised?

43:21.840 --> 43:24.400
You know that he had reasons of his own.

43:25.000 --> 43:26.200
I know it now.

43:28.240 --> 43:31.520
I was too overwhelmed to think about it.

43:36.280 --> 43:38.120
He could help me.

43:44.120 --> 43:45.120
He was…

43:48.520 --> 43:49.720
a legend.

44:14.160 --> 44:15.600
<i>Did you show them?</i>

44:15.680 --> 44:17.200
<i>You did it.</i>

44:17.920 --> 44:19.200
<i>Did you show them?</i>

44:19.560 --> 44:21.440
<i>You showed them, didn’t you?</i>

44:21.760 --> 44:22.760
<i>I showed them!</i>

44:23.280 --> 44:25.440
-<i>He got him fast.</i>
-<i>Who’s “he?”</i>

44:26.000 --> 44:26.800
<i>Meglin.</i>

44:26.880 --> 44:29.200
<i>Meglin works alone. Period.</i>

44:29.280 --> 44:31.040
<i>Will you take me as a trainee?</i>

44:31.120 --> 44:32.600
<i>Okay.</i>

44:32.680 --> 44:34.440
<i>Can I get your phone number</i>
<i>so I can call--</i>

44:34.520 --> 44:36.120
<i>I don’t have a phone.</i>

44:50.280 --> 44:55.280
LIPETSK

45:58.320 --> 46:01.160
Help! Help!

46:04.040 --> 46:05.840
Oh, my God! Stop!
