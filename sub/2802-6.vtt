I adopted my son Olly

05:50.017 --> 05:53.228
through an international adoption lawyer,
Luke Donovan.

05:53.312 --> 05:55.314
-Where's Olly from?
-Chechnya.

05:55.397 --> 05:58.692
Mr. Donovan has connections to agencies
all over Eastern Europe.

05:58.775 --> 06:02.321
A month after the adoption was finalized

06:02.404 --> 06:06.533
he told me the Chechen birth mother
had come forward and wanted Olly back.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.204
He said it was a scam
the birth mothers pull sometimes.

06:10.287 --> 06:12.164
They don't want their kids,
they want your money.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.459
He said I could pay her $50,000
to make her go away.

06:15.542 --> 06:17.085
But she didn't go away.

06:17.169 --> 06:19.004
Last week, he told me

06:19.087 --> 06:21.882
things with the birth mother
had gotten complicated.

06:21.965 --> 06:23.342
That she wanted more money.

06:23.425 --> 06:25.469
He said if I wanted to keep my son

06:25.552 --> 06:30.182
I had one week to come up
with an additional hundred thousand.

06:30.265 --> 06:32.851
-Piece of cake, right?
-One week?

06:33.727 --> 06:37.731
Did Donovan give you any proof
that the birth mother had come forward?

06:37.814 --> 06:41.193
Some papers with chicken scratches
for a signature.

06:41.276 --> 06:44.112
I put in calls to the State Department
to check out his story,

06:44.196 --> 06:45.781
but the clock was ticking.

06:45.864 --> 06:48.909
If he was telling the truth
and I delayed things…

06:48.992 --> 06:50.202
He'd take Olly away from you.

06:51.578 --> 06:53.705
So you decided to rob your own store.

06:53.789 --> 06:56.166
Not exactly mother of the year, I know.

If someone threatened to kidnap your wife,

07:03.173 --> 07:05.008
would you let her out of your sight?

07:06.885 --> 07:09.513
You're sure Olly's adoption was legal?

07:09.596 --> 07:13.016
He has an IR-4 visa,
a Social Security number.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.061
He's my son.

07:16.144 --> 07:19.147
And if I go to prison,
I may never see him again.

07:20.816 --> 07:24.570
Donovan is shaking Catherine down for cash
using her kid as leverage.

07:24.653 --> 07:25.904
It's tough to prove.

07:25.988 --> 07:27.739
Well, maybe it's the real mother,
maybe it's not.

07:27.823 --> 07:31.285
If Catherine calls him on it,
he can just say that the real mom

07:31.368 --> 07:33.829
changed her mind
and moves on to the next family.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.455
Sounds like extortion to me.

07:35.539 --> 07:37.833
-I'm gonna pay Donovan a visit.
-Yeah.

07:44.131 --> 07:47.217

If there's anything I can do…

07:51.638 --> 07:55.100
You can tell me why you demanded
a hundred thousand dollars from her.

07:55.184 --> 07:57.853
No, no, no, I didn't demand anything.

07:57.936 --> 08:02.149
Sometimes, the birth mothers
will threaten to reclaim their children

08:02.232 --> 08:03.984
unless they're given a large sum of money.

08:04.067 --> 08:06.820
It's unfortunate,
but these are the waters.

08:07.487 --> 08:09.865
Prove to me that Olly's birth mother
came forward.

08:09.948 --> 08:12.159
Well, I'll be happy to give you
the name of my Chechen contact.

08:12.242 --> 08:16.371

feel free to charter a flight to Gudermes

08:16.455 --> 08:17.497
and find her yourself.

08:17.581 --> 08:19.458
Catherine told you
she didn't have the money.

08:19.541 --> 08:21.835
Well, yes, and I had no idea
what she'd resort to to get it.

08:21.919 --> 08:23.754
She's an adult, I told her the truth.

08:23.837 --> 08:25.547
She robbed a jewelry store.

08:25.631 --> 08:28.634
If I'm guilty of something,
it's believing that she was a good parent.

What's he doing calling on Donovan?

09:07.047 --> 09:09.299
Maybe he wants Donovan's help
becoming a daddy.

You think the Chechen mob's involved
with these adoptions?

36:09.711 --> 36:10.963
It's your choice.

36:12.381 --> 36:14.550
I know what this guy is capable of.

36:14.633 --> 36:16.385
If you got the money, I'd give it to him.

36:16.468 --> 36:18.554
I don't, but, Mr. Abramov, I'm sorry.

36:18.637 --> 36:20.889
I was expecting a cash payment
when your men picked me up.

36:20.973 --> 36:23.350
No, no, no. Is wrong answer.

36:25.310 --> 36:29.022
And I will give you one minute
to think of right answer.

36:37.614 --> 36:40.033
(NEAL GRUNTING)

36:42.744 --> 36:45.455
(EXCLAIMS) I don't have your money.

-I swear to you.
-(PUNCH LANDS)

36:48.458 --> 36:51.211
I swear to you I don't have your money.
Wait, no.

PETER: (WHISPERS) Say something
about your legs. Your legs.

36:55.007 --> 36:58.135
Oh, God. I swear to you.

36:58.635 --> 37:00.179
Oh, God.

(YELLS) Not fire.

37:02.264 --> 37:03.348
Ow!

37:03.807 --> 37:06.393
Don't let the cigarette… (SCREAMS)

37:14.693 --> 37:16.737
You come up with way to get my money yet?

37:16.820 --> 37:18.405
(INAUDIBLE)

37:19.781 --> 37:22.326
Gentlemen,
give Mr. Donovan same treatment.

37:22.409 --> 37:25.162
No, whoa, whoa. wait, wait, wait.
I can… I can, um…

37:25.245 --> 37:26.997
I… I can get you money, my job…

37:27.080 --> 37:29.208
-Your job?
-I can…

37:29.291 --> 37:30.584
Your job?

37:31.627 --> 37:35.005
-You work for mint or something?
-No, no, no, I'm…

37:35.088 --> 37:37.049
I'm an adoption lawyer
with wealthy clients,

37:37.132 --> 37:38.800
I can get money from them
and I'll cut you in.

37:38.884 --> 37:41.512
My sources tell me you're running
some sort of scam.

37:43.138 --> 37:45.807
I threaten them. I… I tell them
they might lose their kids.

37:47.684 --> 37:49.478
How will I know the plan
of yours will work?

37:50.103 --> 37:51.104
Because I've done it.

37:51.188 --> 37:53.315
I've done it eight, nine, ten times.
It works, I promise.

37:53.398 --> 37:54.566
ABRAMOV: Promise.

37:54.650 --> 37:56.860
Jones, Diana, you got all that, right?

37:56.944 --> 38:00.572
-Oh, yeah.
-PETER: <i>Excellent, everybody move in.</i>

38:01.823 --> 38:03.617

38:04.660 --> 38:07.913
(SIGHS) Agent Burke, these men, they…

38:14.419 --> 38:16.088
Told you I'd be in touch.

38:16.171 --> 38:17.673
This is a setup?

38:20.342 --> 38:21.677
And you were in on it?

38:23.095 --> 38:24.346
Yeah.

38:24.429 --> 38:27.516
Agent Burke explained to me
your little extortion scheme.

38:28.851 --> 38:32.855
What kind of sick animal
messes with innocent Chechen kids?

38:34.273 --> 38:36.108
You should be ashamed of yourself.

38:39.236 --> 38:43.448
Mrs. Mayburn and I plan on playing
that little confession for your clients.

38:43.532 --> 38:45.534
I got a feeling a lot more
extortion victims

38:45.617 --> 38:46.743
are gonna be coming forward.

(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

38:53.083 --> 38:55.586
-So, what happens to Abramov?
-Nothing.

38:56.420 --> 38:58.714
But he so much as gets a parking ticket,

38:58.797 --> 39:02.759
the Organized Crime Division
gets a very thick file.

39:02.843 --> 39:04.386
Generous gesture.

39:11.393 --> 39:12.978
-You know what this place needs?
-Hmm.

39:13.061 --> 39:15.731
-Espresso machine.
-Well, that's a good idea.

39:15.814 --> 39:18.525
Maybe we could dress up Jones
as a pastry chef on Fridays.

39:18.609 --> 39:20.569
I suggest refinement, you make jokes.

39:20.652 --> 39:21.820
No, I'm serious.

39:21.904 --> 39:25.365
I think he'd look handsome
with one of those floppy chef hats.

39:25.449 --> 39:27.326
-It's called a toque.
-I know what it's called.

39:27.409 --> 39:28.785
And no espresso machine.

39:29.286 --> 39:30.913
Can't stand that steam sound.

39:32.706 --> 39:33.707
Hey, Catherine.

39:34.833 --> 39:37.044
How you doing?
Heard the custody meeting went well.

39:37.127 --> 39:39.755
My attorney got me a deferred prosecution.

39:39.838 --> 39:42.174
Strict probation
with some community service.

39:42.257 --> 39:43.842

to thank both of you for everything.

-Yeah.

we'll be okay.

-Wow, that is bad.
-It's awful.

She was your girlfriend
before you went to prison.

40:37.521 --> 40:39.606
What happened to her in that plane?

40:39.690 --> 40:41.066
It's complicated.

on the other end of that phone.
