WEBVTT

00:44.878 --> 00:46.963
Hey, roomie. How's it going?

00:50.508 --> 00:52.927
Gotta go.
Keep up the good work, little guy.

01:07.233 --> 01:09.819
-Hey.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.904
Oh, my God.

01:11.613 --> 01:12.614
Doughnut?

01:12.697 --> 01:14.157
You know, at week 27,

01:14.240 --> 01:17.702
the best thing you could be eating
is walnuts full of omega-3 fatty acids?

01:17.786 --> 01:21.039
Let me tell you how this works.
You're a rookie. You listen to me.

01:21.122 --> 01:23.166
I listen to the baby. Got it?

01:23.750 --> 01:24.959
So I'm lower than the baby?

01:25.043 --> 01:26.044
Now you're getting it.

01:26.127 --> 01:28.880
That's good to know.
So, you're early. What's up?

01:28.963 --> 01:29.923
Chief called.

01:30.006 --> 01:32.550
FBI needs help
on a witness protection detail.

01:32.634 --> 01:33.927
He needs us back by 11:00.

01:34.010 --> 01:35.887
-FBI, huh? Great.
-Mm-hmm.

01:35.970 --> 01:37.806
Doesn't leave us much time
to serve this warrant.

01:37.889 --> 01:41.267
-And don't spill that in my car.
-I'll drink it when we get there.

01:54.698 --> 01:57.200
So, the boss says
this guy's a computer hacker?

01:57.283 --> 02:00.704
More than a hacker. He broke
into Social Security, sent himself checks.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.414
Sounds pretty smart.

02:02.497 --> 02:03.498
All right, rookie.

02:03.581 --> 02:07.293
Before you get all excited about taking
down your first criminal mastermind,

02:07.377 --> 02:10.255
we found the guy
because he had two pounds of Red Vines,

02:10.338 --> 02:12.966
a fake beard and the book,
So You're Moving to Mexico!,

02:13.049 --> 02:15.010
-Ah.

02:15.093 --> 02:16.428
I'll cover the back.

02:16.511 --> 02:18.304
Oh, and if he squirts,
you're doing the running.

02:18.388 --> 02:19.639
On it.

02:23.309 --> 02:24.602
US Marshals.

02:24.686 --> 02:27.689
Ma'am, I'm looking for
a Mr. Lester Chao. He here?

02:27.772 --> 02:30.400
-Oh, Lester.
-Mmm.

02:33.737 --> 02:35.905
Hey, Grandma,
is that the burrito guy?

02:41.077 --> 02:43.204
-US Marshals, put your hands--
-

02:45.957 --> 02:47.208
Ah!

02:49.878 --> 02:51.504
Oh, my God!

02:52.339 --> 02:53.882
-Hey, stay down!

02:57.385 --> 02:58.470
All right.

03:01.556 --> 03:02.557
Where you going?

03:06.269 --> 03:08.063
-All you.
-Okay.

03:14.569 --> 03:15.862
-

03:17.155 --> 03:19.157
-Lester Chao, you're under arrest

03:19.240 --> 03:21.701
for violating
the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.

03:23.661 --> 03:26.122
Well, get him up.

03:26.206 --> 03:28.541
You gonna let a pregnant woman
do all the work?

03:29.584 --> 03:33.296
And I think you're gonna want to add
"assault with a ceramic clown statue."

03:33.380 --> 03:34.506
Got it.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.591
-Lester, it's been a delight.
-

03:36.675 --> 03:38.635
You gotta check out Jalama.

03:38.718 --> 03:42.722
You get a nice offshore, four to six foot,
beach break perfection.

03:42.806 --> 03:46.101
And it's right near Lompoc Federal Pen
where you're gonna do your time.

03:46.184 --> 03:49.854
-I got, like, ten years, man.
-Yeah, it's something to look forward to.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.273
-Ah, Baxter.
-Yo.

03:52.357 --> 03:55.151
-Think about that baby name I mentioned?
-Uh, think about it?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.903
I can't pronounce it.

03:56.986 --> 03:59.155
-Kamohali'li.
-Mmm.

03:59.239 --> 04:00.240
Hawaiian shark god.

04:00.323 --> 04:01.324
You know what?

04:01.408 --> 04:03.243
We have a boy name and a girl name,

04:03.326 --> 04:05.370
but that's the name
if I have a shark baby.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.746
Okay. I'll circle back.

04:08.039 --> 04:09.374
I don't get that guy.

04:09.833 --> 04:12.168
Who, Xavier? Nobody does.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.630
Great deputy though.
If you're good with him, you're good.

04:16.297 --> 04:17.966
Turner, Baxter. Get in here.

04:18.633 --> 04:21.094
This is Agent Long with the FBI.

04:21.720 --> 04:23.680
The chief tells me you're good
at witness protection.

04:23.763 --> 04:26.266
-Well, we try not to lose too many.
-

04:26.349 --> 04:28.893
Excuse me? How many have you lost?

04:28.977 --> 04:33.189
Oh, uh, no. That was a joke.
We-- We haven't ever lost one.

04:33.815 --> 04:36.192
-I hope you'll take this seriously.
-Of course they will.

04:36.276 --> 04:37.277
-Yes.
- Yes.

04:37.360 --> 04:40.613
-Uh, who's the witness?
-His name's Larry Gluck.

04:40.697 --> 04:44.451
He's part of a bank robbery crew.
Hit 22 banks in 2019.

04:44.534 --> 04:48.580
He enters witness protection post-trial.
He'll need 24-hour protection until then.

04:48.663 --> 04:51.416
-No problem. We're--
-

04:53.209 --> 04:55.378
We'll, uh, we'll make sure
he's taken care of.

04:57.422 --> 04:59.215
You two are my bodyguards?

04:59.841 --> 05:02.635
Shouldn't you be… I don't know, bigger?

05:04.637 --> 05:08.224
-Are you pregnant?
- I am. Will you tell my husband?

05:08.308 --> 05:11.144
We'll be in charge
of your safety during the trial.

05:12.228 --> 05:15.231
Hope you're better at your job
than these FBI idiots.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.400
Oh. They're all over me to rat.

05:17.484 --> 05:19.194
"Oh, Larry, make a deal, make a deal."

05:19.277 --> 05:21.988
So I flip and what do you know?
Two of my old crew, they get away.

05:22.072 --> 05:24.866
Two of Mr. Gluck's associates escaped
after a shoot-out.

05:24.949 --> 05:27.744
Which means they're out there
brainstorming ways to torture me.

05:27.827 --> 05:28.995
We won't let that happen.

05:29.079 --> 05:31.623
How you gonna do that,
wrap me up in your embryonic sac?

05:31.706 --> 05:32.791
Keep me in your little tummy?

05:32.874 --> 05:36.878
I'm going to need to know the specifics
of my client's security arrangements.

05:36.961 --> 05:40.006
We don't discuss security protocols.
It's to keep your client safe.

05:40.090 --> 05:41.675
-Shall we?
-Mmm.

05:41.758 --> 05:43.009
-

05:44.260 --> 05:45.553
That's the best you can do?

05:46.554 --> 05:47.555
Stop here.

05:47.639 --> 05:49.683
-Take one-- Take one of these?
- Yep.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.768
-No, no.
- Okay, fine.

05:54.521 --> 05:56.106
Decoy one, go.

05:56.606 --> 05:57.941
Decoy two, go.

06:15.917 --> 06:19.504
You've got to be kidding me.
This place is a freaking dump!

06:19.587 --> 06:20.672
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:20.755 --> 06:23.383
Yeah, you know, we had a room for you
at the Four Seasons, but they just--

06:23.466 --> 06:25.844
They have this crazy rule
against bank robbers.

06:25.927 --> 06:28.805
Hey, don't look so down.
The place comes with babysitters.

06:28.888 --> 06:31.391
Deputy Kim's right outside
and Barrios here

06:31.474 --> 06:33.351
-will tuck you in at night.
-Yo.

06:33.435 --> 06:35.562
We'll be back in the morning
to take you to court.

06:35.645 --> 06:37.230
I just sit here? What about food?

06:37.856 --> 06:39.899
I don't see a room service menu.
You know what?

06:39.983 --> 06:43.194
The vending machine's got those
nacho cheese combos from the early '90s.

06:43.278 --> 06:44.404
Ooh, might not have 'em long.

06:44.487 --> 06:45.947
-I could go for a combo.
-Mmm.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.157
-Shall we?
-Let's do it.

06:47.240 --> 06:48.742
-Bye, Larry.
-

06:50.243 --> 06:51.578
Oh, God.

06:51.661 --> 06:53.079
When I was an MP in Iraq,

06:53.163 --> 06:56.875
I got in fights with drunk Navy Seals
that didn't kick like this baby.

06:56.958 --> 06:59.627
I swear it's like the kid's trying
to escape through my kidney.

06:59.711 --> 07:02.797
You know if you need to take it slower,
you can talk to the chief.

07:02.881 --> 07:04.883
-He already wants me riding a desk.
-

07:04.966 --> 07:08.053
No. I'm staying on the street
till they drag me off.

07:09.721 --> 07:12.182
Uh-oh. Who's blowing up your phone?

07:12.265 --> 07:15.060
-Oh, uh, my mom. Yeah.
-Okay.

07:15.143 --> 07:17.103
She's packing up my dad's old stuff.

07:18.104 --> 07:19.481
I'll call her when I get home.

07:19.564 --> 07:20.982
That must be rough.

07:21.066 --> 07:23.068
Losing a husband
all of a sudden like that.

07:24.027 --> 07:25.779
And you're not giving her any grandbabies.

07:25.862 --> 07:28.073
Oh. You're having a baby
so I gotta have one too?

07:28.156 --> 07:29.157
Maybe.

07:29.240 --> 07:31.451
My sister already gave her
the best grandkid ever,

07:31.534 --> 07:33.119
and I'm not really dating anyway, so…

07:33.203 --> 07:36.498
Right, 'cause you're still hung up
on that ex who dumped you?

07:36.581 --> 07:40.543
Not hung up. Did not dump me. Nope.
We just decided to focus on our careers.

07:40.627 --> 07:43.713
And that's why I keep catching you
on her Instagram?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.131
It would be rude to unfollow.

07:45.215 --> 07:47.050
-I be watching.
-What--

07:47.592 --> 07:48.593
Oh, man.

07:48.677 --> 07:51.304
Hey, point is, say the word,
I'll set you up. I got cousins.

07:51.388 --> 07:54.516
Yeah, I've met your cousins.
They're lovely. Maybe after I make chief.

07:54.599 --> 07:56.810
Thank you.
Let's never talk about it again, okay?

08:08.530 --> 08:09.739
Looks like we got a visitor.

08:14.077 --> 08:16.413
-Matt, Laura, what are you doing here?
-

08:16.496 --> 08:18.748
-Uncle Scott, we brought your dog.
-Geez. Whoa.

08:18.832 --> 08:20.125
-Hey, Scotty.
- Hello.

08:20.208 --> 08:22.502
And Mom wanted to be here,
but she got tied up with all the packing.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.881
-So, this is Hooch.
-

08:26.965 --> 08:29.592
There's food, a leash, some toys.
This one's his favorite.

08:29.676 --> 08:30.885
-Mr. Horsey.
-Okay.

08:30.969 --> 08:34.055
I don't mean to just drop him and go, but
traffic was awful getting into the city,

08:34.139 --> 08:36.599
and it's Grady's night with Matthew
tonight, so I have to run.

08:36.683 --> 08:38.727
What's going on?
What are you talking about?

08:38.810 --> 08:40.270
-Didn't Mom call you?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:40.353 --> 08:43.857
I had a crazy, busy day. I was about to
call her back. She was calling about this?

08:44.858 --> 08:49.529
He slobbered all over the car.
Mom calls him the Fountain of Spit.

08:49.612 --> 08:51.448
-It was awesome.

08:51.531 --> 08:52.615
That is awesome.

08:52.699 --> 08:55.076
You can't just drop off a giant dog
I've never met in my house, Laura.

08:55.160 --> 08:58.538
Okay.
Dad adopted Hooch last November.

08:58.621 --> 09:02.208
So the only reason you haven't met him
is you hardly ever come home anymore.

09:02.292 --> 09:04.669
And second, Mom said
she made all the arrangements with you.

09:04.753 --> 09:08.590
-Matt, don't you want a dog, buddy?
-But he's your dog, Uncle Scott.

09:08.673 --> 09:12.052
Yeah, but you two seem to have
a pretty special bond, right?

09:12.135 --> 09:13.887
Like, maybe if you told your mom…

09:13.970 --> 09:17.474
Mom says I'll see him when I visit,
that Grandpa wanted you to have him.

09:17.557 --> 09:18.767
-What? What?
-

09:18.850 --> 09:20.560
That's true. Here.

09:22.187 --> 09:25.607
Mom gave me this.
Dad wrote it before he passed.

09:27.233 --> 09:31.613
But-- Laura. Laura. I cannot do this.
I cannot take care of a dog.

09:31.696 --> 09:33.615
Stop being so dramatic.
You grew up around dogs.

09:33.698 --> 09:35.450
Grew up around earthquakes.
Doesn't mean I want one.

09:35.533 --> 09:36.951
Well, you got one now.

09:37.577 --> 09:38.828
-Go on, Hooch, you're home!
-No! No, no!

09:39.496 --> 09:41.623
-You're gonna be fine.
-I will not be fine.

09:41.706 --> 09:44.584
Matt, you wanna say something
to your mom? Say something!

09:44.668 --> 09:46.920
Hooch! No, no, no. No! Hooch.

09:48.004 --> 09:50.423
Come-- Come here. Come here.
Hooch! Sit, sit, sit.

09:51.299 --> 09:53.468
Stay down-- Stay. Oh! Whoa, whoa!

09:53.551 --> 09:56.471
Whoa, whoa. Oh, oh! Whoa!

09:56.554 --> 09:58.807
Oh, no!

10:11.528 --> 10:13.613
-

10:13.697 --> 10:17.450
You-- You will stay in the kitchen.

10:17.534 --> 10:19.452
-

10:19.536 --> 10:21.871
Mom, Mom, you can't just send me a dog.

10:21.955 --> 10:24.165
I didn't just send him. I called.

10:24.249 --> 10:26.459
And I was literally
just about to call you back,

10:26.543 --> 10:28.461
but I can't take care of him, okay?

10:28.545 --> 10:31.089
I don't even spend enough time
with my Roomba. All right?

10:31.172 --> 10:33.174
I'm literally working all the time.

10:33.258 --> 10:37.470
Your father worked all the time,
and he took great care of his dogs.

10:37.554 --> 10:39.014
Not the same. He was a local cop.

10:39.097 --> 10:42.308
Well, he wanted you to have Hooch.
He rescued him from the shelter.

10:42.392 --> 10:45.895
He said it was almost
like the original Hooch came back.

10:45.979 --> 10:50.233
Which is all very magical, Mom,
but I can't take care of him.

10:50.316 --> 10:51.985
I just got put on street duty.

10:52.068 --> 10:55.613
I'm working all the time, and I--
I'm still trying to prove myself, Mom.

10:55.697 --> 10:58.158
Come on. You're gonna love him.

10:58.241 --> 11:01.036
You know I love dogs. I love your dogs.

11:01.119 --> 11:04.664
I lo-- I love all dogs,
but there's a reason I never got a--

11:04.748 --> 11:06.708
-

11:06.791 --> 11:07.792
I'll call you back.

11:12.922 --> 11:16.343
-I left you alone for 30 seconds.
-

11:18.762 --> 11:21.890
Hope you're having fun,
'cause you're leaving tomorrow.

11:26.561 --> 11:28.480
"You grew up with dogs." Yeah, I know.

11:58.593 --> 12:01.012
We never should've broken up.

12:01.096 --> 12:03.264
We're incredible together.

12:04.641 --> 12:08.561
You're bad. You're bad. You're bad.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.441
Oh.

12:15.026 --> 12:16.319
Oh.

12:17.445 --> 12:18.988
Oh, uh…

12:19.072 --> 12:21.533
Oh… Oh.

12:23.952 --> 12:25.704
Roomie! Roomie!

12:29.124 --> 12:31.459
Laura, you can't do this to me.

12:31.543 --> 12:33.503
If I leave him at my house,
he'll destroy it.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.213
He already made me late for work.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.549
Look, if it'll help,
I may be able to stop by later

12:37.632 --> 12:40.885
-and help you with some dog-proofing--
- No, no, no.

12:40.969 --> 12:44.097
I don't need dog-proofing,
I need dog removal, Laura.

12:44.180 --> 12:46.266
Hooch would be way too much here, okay?

12:46.349 --> 12:48.685
I mean, gosh, I am barely
keeping it together as it is.

12:48.768 --> 12:51.521
Between Matthew and the foster turtles,
and Boodles has a cold,

12:51.604 --> 12:54.774
and Blob has his exercises
and his special needs.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.693
I have needs! I have needs, Laura.

12:56.776 --> 12:57.986
Look, my partner's calling me.

12:58.069 --> 13:00.780
Just think about it. Agree to think
about it. I'm gonna call you back.

13:00.864 --> 13:02.449
Are you thinking about it? I gotta go.

13:02.532 --> 13:03.825
-Hey, Jess. Sorry, I'm--
- Scott?

13:03.908 --> 13:07.078
Scott, we've got an emergency here.
The safe house got hit.

13:07.162 --> 13:08.496
Wait, what? What happened?

13:08.580 --> 13:11.291
Barrios is down! The witness is gone!

13:11.374 --> 13:14.044
Jess, I'm five minutes away.
Can you give me a description? Anything.

13:14.127 --> 13:17.922
Yes. Three males in masks,
driving a silver Suburban.

13:18.006 --> 13:20.967
Got it. I'm on my--
W-Wait. Silver Suburban?

13:21.051 --> 13:23.595
Yes. Yes, they went south on Linwood.

13:23.678 --> 13:24.971
I see 'em! I'm in pursuit.

13:30.769 --> 13:31.811
We got company.

13:33.229 --> 13:34.773
Can't make out during a car chase, Hooch.

13:34.856 --> 13:36.816
We can't make out during a car chase.
Stay back.

13:40.403 --> 13:41.696
-Come on.
-

13:42.405 --> 13:43.490
No, no, no. No barking.

13:44.657 --> 13:46.034
Watch it!
-

13:46.826 --> 13:48.661
-

13:48.745 --> 13:50.413
No howling. No howling either.

13:56.169 --> 13:58.338
Tail in my eyes. No, Hooch.
A little less tail, Hooch--

14:00.799 --> 14:02.884
Hey!

14:02.967 --> 14:04.552
-Sorry!
-What are you doing?

14:04.636 --> 14:07.389
No, no. Dirty! Dirty. Put that down.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.311
-Look out!

14:14.729 --> 14:17.107
Hold on!

14:24.364 --> 14:25.323
-

14:27.492 --> 14:29.119
Whoa. Oh, my…

14:36.251 --> 14:38.211
-I see them.

14:45.885 --> 14:47.345
-

14:50.890 --> 14:55.395
Requesting backup. I'm in an alley off
of 15th, approaching suspects' vehicle.

14:58.732 --> 14:59.983
-

15:01.609 --> 15:03.653
No, Hooch, go away. Go.

15:05.071 --> 15:06.156
Hooch, go back to the car.

15:13.580 --> 15:16.041
Hooch, we're not playing
with trash right now. Go!

15:33.058 --> 15:35.310
-

15:40.231 --> 15:43.485
I do not have a visual.
Suspects are not with the car.

15:48.198 --> 15:51.326
Seriously, Hooch? Hooch, get away.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.204
Hooch, go!

16:09.886 --> 16:11.888
Barrios is gonna be fine. Thank God.

16:11.971 --> 16:14.224
Bullet made it through his body armor,
but didn't do much damage.

16:14.307 --> 16:17.894
Our case, on the other hand,
that's a disaster. How did this happen?

16:17.977 --> 16:22.273
It was an ambush. Three dudes in masks
hit while we were changing shifts.

16:22.357 --> 16:25.318
I-- I was heading in, I ID'd
the suspects' vehicle and pursued--

16:25.402 --> 16:28.071
-You should have been at the site.
-I was slightly delayed, sir.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.447
Chief, it's not Scott's fault.

16:29.531 --> 16:31.950
If he hadn't been on the road,
they would have gotten away clean.

16:32.033 --> 16:33.868
But they still got away, didn't they?

16:33.952 --> 16:36.996
Police backup found nothing,
the car's a total waste, evidence-wise.

16:37.080 --> 16:38.081
Also…

16:39.124 --> 16:40.709
why is there a dog in the office?

16:40.792 --> 16:44.671
It's a long story, sir.
The animal was given to me.

16:44.754 --> 16:48.258
I tried to leave him downstairs,
but he kept eating the headrest in my car.

16:48.341 --> 16:51.928
-Um, why-- why's he between my legs?
-

16:52.012 --> 16:54.973
He likes you, sir. Or--
Or maybe you recently had peanut butter.

16:55.932 --> 16:56.933
Peanut butter?

16:57.642 --> 16:59.519
Where the hell's my client?

16:59.602 --> 17:02.480
Deputy Turner. Didn't you tell me
you knew what you were doing?

17:02.564 --> 17:04.899
-Huh? Maybe you can tell me where my cli--
-

17:08.945 --> 17:10.405
You keep that thing away from me.

17:11.239 --> 17:12.323
Hooch, quiet.

17:12.407 --> 17:14.868
Maybe you should've chose a different day
to bring your dog to work.

17:14.951 --> 17:15.952
It's not mine.

17:16.036 --> 17:17.454
The Bureau was counting on you.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.955
Your team blew our entire case.

17:19.039 --> 17:21.082
-Why don't we, uh, talk in my office?
-Yes.

17:21.166 --> 17:22.709
First, we'll talk about finding my client,

17:22.792 --> 17:25.045
then we'll talk
about the lawsuit I'm filing.

17:25.128 --> 17:26.129
-Okay.
-

17:26.212 --> 17:28.381
And that is a health code violation.

17:33.553 --> 17:35.764
Hey. You all right?

17:36.389 --> 17:37.390
Yeah, I'm fine.

17:38.016 --> 17:39.809
That's your "I'm fine" face?

17:39.893 --> 17:40.935
Ouch.

17:41.019 --> 17:44.189
I've been on the streets with you, what,
three months? Now this happens?

17:44.272 --> 17:48.068
You can't blame yourself. There's a reason
I vouched for you with the chief.

17:48.860 --> 17:52.697
Fact is, nobody cares about doing
the job right more than you do.

17:52.781 --> 17:56.951
You remember that time you reimbursed
the department 35 cents for parking?

17:57.035 --> 17:58.036
Thirty-five cents!

17:58.119 --> 18:01.247
-Is this supposed to make me feel better?
-I'm just telling it like it is.

18:01.331 --> 18:03.083
What are you gonna do
about your new roommate?

18:03.166 --> 18:04.918
-Oh, Hooch?
-Yeah.

18:05.001 --> 18:08.088
Well, obviously I can't keep him.
Guess I gotta take him to the poun--

18:08.171 --> 18:11.633
-Do not say "the pound," Scott Turner.
-You saw him in there.

18:11.716 --> 18:14.844
So what, he hates lawyers.
That's a plus in my book.

18:14.928 --> 18:17.889
You do know what happens
to dogs at the pound, right?

18:17.972 --> 18:22.310
Yeah, some-- Many get adopted, right?
To wonderful, loving families.

18:22.394 --> 18:25.313
Shouldn't Hooch be
with a wonderful, loving family?

18:25.397 --> 18:27.524
Who, I don't know, loves slobber?

18:30.944 --> 18:33.780
What are you looking at, man?
I didn't destroy your apartment.

18:35.156 --> 18:38.910
All right, look. I think I might
know someone you can talk to.

18:40.537 --> 18:45.000
So I'm working with this new guy,
Scott Turner. He's in a bit of a jam.

18:45.083 --> 18:48.294
You think you could give him
some pointers with his dog?

18:49.462 --> 18:51.548
I don't think pointers would help.

18:51.631 --> 18:55.010
I mean, training a dog
is all about building a relationship.

18:55.093 --> 18:56.845
-Yeah.
-It could take years for a working dog--

18:56.928 --> 18:59.389
Working dog? Oh, no, no, no.

18:59.472 --> 19:03.018
I just think he wants a dog
who won't, like, eat his car seats

19:03.101 --> 19:05.562
and jump in the bed with him,
that kinda thing.

19:05.645 --> 19:09.733
Oh, well. With behavior issues like that,
it could be something deeper.

19:09.816 --> 19:13.153
If you think he should just give up
on the dog, then I'll tell him that--

19:13.236 --> 19:16.031
No! Jess, you should never give up
on an animal.

19:16.114 --> 19:18.283
-Right.
-I mean, I could help any dog.

19:18.366 --> 19:20.535
Oh, great. So, Erica, meet Scott.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.287
Uh.

19:22.370 --> 19:26.708
I'll let you two chat.
I got a doughnut waiting in the car.

19:26.791 --> 19:28.626
-Oh--
-Thanks.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.380
Hi. I-- I'm Erica Mounir.

19:32.464 --> 19:35.383
Uh, Scott Turner. This is Hooch.

19:35.467 --> 19:36.634
Hi, Hooch.

19:37.802 --> 19:41.890
I run the K-9 explosives detection
training for the Marshal Service.

19:41.973 --> 19:44.059
I-I know this is an unusual situation,

19:44.142 --> 19:46.936
but if there's anything you can do,
please.

19:47.020 --> 19:49.105
Please, I'm-- I'm desperate.

19:50.315 --> 19:52.859
So, how'd you end up with him exactly?

19:52.942 --> 19:54.986
Oh, uh, my father left him to me.

19:55.070 --> 19:57.572
And if I give him away,
my family will disown me,

19:57.655 --> 19:59.991
and I'm pretty sure Jessica will shoot me,
or worse.

20:00.075 --> 20:02.535
Oh. What's worse than shooting you?

20:02.619 --> 20:05.080
Um, uh… Uh, I'm sure she had some ideas.

20:05.163 --> 20:06.456
-Yeah. Sorry.
-Hi.

20:06.539 --> 20:10.794
So anyway, I'm just stuck with him
for now, and he's just totally untrained.

20:11.628 --> 20:13.338
-Do you mind if I--
-Please.

20:13.963 --> 20:15.256
Hooch, sit.

20:16.925 --> 20:18.134
Good boy.

20:18.843 --> 20:19.803
Uh…

20:19.886 --> 20:22.889
Look. Look. Good.

20:23.890 --> 20:25.600
-Down.
-

20:25.684 --> 20:26.685
Wow.

20:26.768 --> 20:27.769
Oh, roll over.

20:28.853 --> 20:32.565
Ah! Good boy. Good boy.

20:34.734 --> 20:37.654
Maybe my dad showed him some things,
'cause--

20:38.154 --> 20:40.615
'cause with me… it's not good.

20:40.699 --> 20:42.492
-Yeah.
-He almost ate a lawyer.

20:42.575 --> 20:47.414
So, um, usually in situations like this,
it's less about the dog than the owner.

20:48.164 --> 20:50.625
-So it's my fault?
-No. No, no.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.253
Maybe. A little bit?

20:54.045 --> 20:57.757
It's just, dogs watch us,
they read our faces, our bodies.

20:57.841 --> 20:59.342
They can tell if we're nervous…

20:59.426 --> 21:00.635
-Shh.

21:00.719 --> 21:03.555
-…or angry, or when we need love.
-

21:04.180 --> 21:07.767
Okay, right. But Hooch didn't destroy
my apartment 'cause I need love.

21:07.851 --> 21:11.604
Well, Jess said he got into bed with you,
so maybe Hooch thought you did.

21:15.400 --> 21:17.569
I'm sorry. You don't need love.

21:17.652 --> 21:20.488
I mean--
You probably have tons of girlfriends…

21:20.572 --> 21:21.865
-I don't.
-You don't?

21:21.948 --> 21:23.241
-I mean, it's fine.
-Great.

21:23.324 --> 21:24.743
-Hey.
-Hey.

21:24.826 --> 21:26.828
Can you help me? With the dog.

21:26.911 --> 21:29.706
-Sure. I'd love to help with the dog.
-Great.

21:29.789 --> 21:31.750
-How's Thursday?
-Love it.

21:31.833 --> 21:33.043
I wish it was Thursday.

21:33.126 --> 21:35.170
-I'm-- I'm counting the hours, seriously.
-Bye, Hooch.

21:35.253 --> 21:36.254
Thank you. Bye. Bye.

21:36.338 --> 21:37.380
The exit's that way.

21:38.882 --> 21:40.508
Mmm. This is good.

21:40.592 --> 21:44.220
Uncle Scott usually never has any food
other than chicken breast and vegetables.

21:44.304 --> 21:45.638
-Yeah.
-Mmm.

21:45.722 --> 21:47.349
You know, you can thank Hooch for that.

21:47.432 --> 21:50.226
He unplugged my fridge somehow,
and all my food went bad.

21:50.310 --> 21:51.561
Mm-hmm.

21:52.562 --> 21:56.441
He behaves for everyone but me.
I-- I swear, he's doing this deliberately.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.902
It's like Dad said.
It doesn't matter if they drive you crazy.

21:58.985 --> 22:01.154
If the dog's got your back
and you've got the dog's back,

22:01.237 --> 22:03.114
-that's your forever dog.
-"Your forever dog."

22:03.198 --> 22:07.160
Yes. Well, Hooch is not my forever dog.
I don't even think he's my two-minute dog.

22:07.243 --> 22:10.622
Although, to be fair, I've had him all day
and it's felt like forever.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.750
Aw. You made him sad.

22:13.833 --> 22:17.545
No, that's his face. Okay? He literally
always looks sad. It masks the evil.

22:18.588 --> 22:23.093
Hey, Matty, show Uncle Scott
what we found in Grandpa's things.

22:26.471 --> 22:27.931
It's you and Grandpa.

22:29.766 --> 22:30.892
I miss Grandpa.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.186
Me too, bud.

22:33.853 --> 22:36.523
-Mom says you fought all the time.
-

22:37.357 --> 22:41.277
You know, um… we loved each other. A lot.

22:41.361 --> 22:43.863
But he just--
he didn't want me to move to the city,

22:43.947 --> 22:46.032
and then he wanted me to have a dog.

22:47.617 --> 22:48.702
So, he won the fight?

22:50.870 --> 22:53.248
Uh, yeah.

22:54.165 --> 22:57.711
Now that you mention it,
it-- it appears he did.

22:59.879 --> 23:02.298
-Why don't you like dogs?
-Wha--

23:03.967 --> 23:05.176
Answer the question.

23:05.260 --> 23:07.470
Of course I like dogs.

23:07.554 --> 23:14.060
I just-- I don't like the way
that they drool. And smell. And act.

23:14.144 --> 23:16.271
First sign of a sociopath?
Distaste for dogs.

23:16.354 --> 23:18.023
Oh.

23:18.106 --> 23:19.441
I'm trying to focus on my job, bud.

23:19.524 --> 23:22.610
But Grandpa said
dogs made him better at his job.

23:22.694 --> 23:24.612
That they were smarter than people.

23:24.696 --> 23:27.699
'Cause people see
what they think they should see,

23:27.782 --> 23:29.367
but dogs just see what's there.

23:30.368 --> 23:31.661
Hmm.

23:35.707 --> 23:39.544
Hey, Matty, come help me with the door.
Let's let him work. Come on.

23:41.129 --> 23:43.340
Dogs see what's there.

23:45.550 --> 23:47.385
Chief, I was thinking it over
and I realized,

23:47.469 --> 23:49.721
this whole kidnapping thing,
it doesn't add up, does it?

23:49.804 --> 23:52.599
Seems pretty simple. Gluck's crew
came after him for turning on 'em.

23:52.682 --> 23:54.851
But how do we know it was them?

23:55.852 --> 23:58.021
-Who else would it be?
- It doesn't fit their MO at all.

23:58.104 --> 23:59.773
I mean, look at the files.

24:01.316 --> 24:02.817
What the hell happened to these?

24:02.901 --> 24:07.364
Uh, I'm still working on the whole
"paper's not food" thing with Hooch. Hey--

24:07.447 --> 24:11.493
-Hooch, slow down! Sorry.

24:11.576 --> 24:12.660
Oh, you okay?

24:13.661 --> 24:17.540
I need our witness back, Turner.
Not speculation and dog spit.

24:17.624 --> 24:20.168
-Yeah.
-Look, I wanted to talk to you.

24:20.251 --> 24:22.754
I'm taking
you and Deputy Baxter off the case.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.965
-What?
-This is direct from US Marshal Sickerman.

24:26.049 --> 24:28.426
The FBI Special Agent in charge
is blaming us.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.512
It's a whole political thing now.

24:30.595 --> 24:32.639
Chief, I promise you I am onto something--

24:32.722 --> 24:34.557
Turner. Don't make this harder
than it has to be.

24:34.641 --> 24:36.309
Get your files, get your dog and go home.

24:38.061 --> 24:39.062
Okay.

24:41.606 --> 24:44.150
-So that's it? We're just off the case?
-

24:44.234 --> 24:47.445
All I know is what the chief said.
The FBI is upset, and--

24:47.529 --> 24:49.155
-And we're the fall guys.
-Come on.

24:49.239 --> 24:50.824
Yeah, it seems to be the idea.

24:54.869 --> 24:57.580
What is that thing doing
in the building again? It's a menace.

24:57.664 --> 24:59.582
Calm down. We're just leaving.

24:59.666 --> 25:02.377
Hey! Heard you two
got thrown off the case.

25:02.460 --> 25:05.338
Least the Marshal Service
got that right.

25:05.422 --> 25:08.758
What happened to you?
You had it right before.

25:08.842 --> 25:11.886
Bad man. Bite. Got it?

25:12.470 --> 25:14.180
You're hopeless.

25:16.766 --> 25:22.772
Well, you ate my files, got me
kicked off the case, ruined my apartment--

25:23.398 --> 25:25.275
Anything else in my life
you want to destroy?

25:26.401 --> 25:27.861
Don't answer that.

25:59.351 --> 26:02.979
You want to read this with me?
I guess it's about you.

26:04.814 --> 26:06.232
I'll take that as a yes.

26:22.582 --> 26:26.544
"Dear Scotty, I know we haven't
always agreed on things,

26:26.628 --> 26:28.672
and I know you think you don't want a dog.

26:29.381 --> 26:31.341
There was a time I thought the same.

26:31.424 --> 26:34.594
But everything I care about
in my life started with a dog.

26:36.971 --> 26:39.057
Your mom, your sister…

26:40.850 --> 26:41.935
and you.

26:44.354 --> 26:46.481
-

26:49.567 --> 26:52.153
I want you to have that forever dog
you can count on.

26:53.154 --> 26:54.489
Hooch is special, Scott.

26:54.572 --> 26:59.244
He's smart, he's loyal and,
more than anything, he's got a big heart.

27:03.123 --> 27:06.626
And I want you to have a dog who loves
everyone as much as I love you."

27:15.552 --> 27:16.636
Thanks, Hooch.

27:19.556 --> 27:21.433
Maybe you don't love everyone.

27:25.228 --> 27:26.312
Ugh.

27:29.524 --> 27:30.567
Wait a second.

27:31.443 --> 27:33.361
What was up with you and that lawyer?

27:34.362 --> 27:36.239
I mean, yesterday
you wanted to eat the guy,

27:36.322 --> 27:39.075
and today, he was less interesting
than the office plant.

27:42.037 --> 27:43.079
Unless…

27:43.788 --> 27:45.081
Angel.

27:45.165 --> 27:46.708
-Good. With me.
-

27:47.584 --> 27:48.668
Angel, heel.

27:48.752 --> 27:50.086
Good girl.

27:50.170 --> 27:51.254
Hey. Uh, Erica?

27:52.172 --> 27:54.049
-Deputy Turner!
-Can I talk to you?

27:54.132 --> 27:55.300
Uh…

27:56.676 --> 27:59.512
Didn't we say Thursday? Is today Thursday?

27:59.596 --> 28:00.930
Nope. It's Wednesday.

28:01.014 --> 28:06.019
Oh. Okay. Cool. So, you're just
here Wednesday then.

28:06.102 --> 28:07.896
You know that thing you said the other day

28:07.979 --> 28:10.607
about dogs being able
to pick up on human emotions?

28:10.690 --> 28:12.984
Like, things we don't necessarily know
we're doing?

28:13.068 --> 28:14.069
Yeah.

28:14.152 --> 28:17.906
I was wondering if they just see,
like-- like, dog-related things--

28:17.989 --> 28:19.991
No, they see all kinds of things.

28:20.075 --> 28:23.370
They can sense tiny, little changes
in our facial expressions

28:23.453 --> 28:24.913
and the way we move--

28:24.996 --> 28:27.040
I mean, they don't just see things either.

28:27.123 --> 28:29.250
They can smell changes
in our body chemistry.

28:29.334 --> 28:31.336
And then they just use that
to sense our emotions.

28:31.419 --> 28:33.046
-Isn't that cool?

28:33.129 --> 28:36.007
I mean, they could smell
if we're sad or stressed--

28:36.091 --> 28:38.385
Not that you smell. You smell great.

28:38.468 --> 28:41.012
I'm sorr-- My question's just
a little more urgent than that.

28:41.096 --> 28:42.180
Oh.

28:42.263 --> 28:46.476
We had a witness get abducted, and I think
it might have been an inside job.

28:46.559 --> 28:47.769
What?

28:47.852 --> 28:51.481
Do you think a dog might be able to,
like-- like, pick up on that?

28:51.564 --> 28:53.149
It's possible, for sure.

28:53.233 --> 28:55.151
A dog can tell
if someone's hiding something,

28:55.235 --> 28:57.570
especially if they're nervous
or angry about it.

28:57.654 --> 28:59.072
Do you think that Hooch--

28:59.155 --> 29:01.074
Yesterday, he was barking at this lawyer.
Hated him.

29:01.157 --> 29:02.117
-

29:02.200 --> 29:04.077
And then today,
didn't care about him. At all.

29:04.160 --> 29:07.539
And I realize,
what if he wasn't barking at the lawyer?

29:08.206 --> 29:11.334
What if he was barking
at the FBI agent behind him?

29:13.503 --> 29:17.132
He knew everything about the operation,
and if he betrayed us--

29:17.215 --> 29:19.884
Yeah. I think maybe Hooch
sees something that we don't.

29:25.807 --> 29:28.018
-You all right?

29:28.101 --> 29:29.644
How do you think I am?

29:29.728 --> 29:33.148
It's bad enough Barrios is in the hospital
and we lost the witness,

29:33.231 --> 29:35.358
but now I can't even do anything about it.

29:36.067 --> 29:38.611
Baby-- You think that this may be a sign?

29:39.237 --> 29:42.699
I mean, with the baby comin' and all,
maybe it's time for you to, you know--

29:42.782 --> 29:46.327
Uh-uh. This kid already took my perfect
butt. I draw the line at my career.

29:46.411 --> 29:49.831
Come on. All I'm saying is that
with the baby comin', maybe it's time to--

29:49.914 --> 29:51.249
To what?

29:51.750 --> 29:55.045
You know, enjoy some
of these fine pork chops I prepared.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.880
The pork chops?
That's what you were about to say.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.131
Mm-hmm.

29:58.214 --> 30:01.760
'Cause you do know it's a crime
to lie to federal law enforcement.

30:03.303 --> 30:06.056
-

30:06.139 --> 30:07.474
You eat. I'll get it.

30:10.602 --> 30:11.644
-Hey.
-Hey.

30:11.728 --> 30:12.729
Oh, hey, Hooch!

30:13.938 --> 30:15.065
What are you guys doing here?

30:15.148 --> 30:17.776
Thinking about doing something stupid
that could end my career.

30:18.610 --> 30:21.196
Of all the words I never thought
I'd hear come out your mouth…

30:21.279 --> 30:24.991
Jess, I think I know how to find Larry.

30:27.660 --> 30:29.412
Agent Long should be leaving soon.

30:29.496 --> 30:31.956
I called and checked.
He's working late with the chief.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.670
Just wanna make sure I have this straight.

30:36.753 --> 30:41.508
We're tailing an FBI agent
because your dog got a hunch.

30:41.591 --> 30:43.968
You sure you don't wanna
run this by a hamster first?

30:44.052 --> 30:47.681
It's not just a hunch. You know that alley
I chased the Suburban to?

30:49.641 --> 30:52.268
Remember I told you
Hooch kept wanting to play in the garbage?

30:52.352 --> 30:54.562
So I started thinking,
what if he wasn't playing?

30:54.646 --> 30:58.191
What if he was following the kidnappers?
Turns out, I was right.

30:58.274 --> 31:01.611
I went back to that alley
with Hooch earlier, and I find this mask.

31:02.237 --> 31:05.407
That's one of the masks they had,
but how does it connect to Agent Long?

31:05.490 --> 31:09.327
Think about it. Why stop in that alley?
It doesn't make sense.

31:09.411 --> 31:12.455
Unless Agent Long had
to get rid of his disguise

31:12.539 --> 31:14.541
so he could get back to the crime scene.

31:16.292 --> 31:18.628
Have you been huffing your protein powder?

31:19.254 --> 31:22.632
Accusing an FBI agent
of joining a bank heist crew,

31:24.843 --> 31:26.720
We could check the mask
with the DNA test, but that--

31:26.803 --> 31:30.265
Jessica, we don't need the DNA.
We have Hooch.

31:30.348 --> 31:33.435
When I went back to that dumpster,
why did Hooch go straight for the mask?

31:34.310 --> 31:36.813
Because he smelled Agent Long.

31:41.443 --> 31:44.946
Wow. And Hooch figured it out
all by himself.

31:46.406 --> 31:48.450
That's incredible.

31:48.533 --> 31:49.784
What do you mean?

31:49.868 --> 31:52.829
Well, he was the one
who knew to look in the garbage.

31:52.912 --> 31:57.417
That's not-- I mean, I actually, you know,
sort of put the pieces together.

31:57.500 --> 32:01.880
Really, Scott? That's low.
Taking the credit from poor Hooch?

32:01.963 --> 32:06.384
-How am I taking credit?
-I am so sorry, Hooch. Good job. Good job.

32:06.468 --> 32:08.803
-I'm a deputy marshal, okay?
-Yeah.

32:08.887 --> 32:10.722
-He's a dog. He eats bugs.
-Oh, my Go--

32:10.805 --> 32:13.266
- That Agent Long?

32:14.517 --> 32:15.518
Yep.

32:16.644 --> 32:17.645
Some dog.

32:57.686 --> 33:00.397
Unless the Feds are setting up shop
in janky warehouse buildings,

33:00.480 --> 33:01.481
we should check it out.

33:01.564 --> 33:02.857
What about the baby?

33:02.941 --> 33:05.860
Did they not cover this in health class?
The baby goes where I go.

33:06.569 --> 33:09.322
And before you give me some speech
about protecting me,

33:09.406 --> 33:11.574
let me just say that my back hurts,
I gotta pee

33:11.658 --> 33:13.201
and my feet are like water balloons.

33:13.284 --> 33:16.579
But more important than all of that,
is we got a witness to save.

33:16.663 --> 33:18.415
-So just grab Hooch, and let's go.
-W-Wait.

33:18.498 --> 33:20.250
Wait, you want to bring Hooch too?

33:20.333 --> 33:23.003
-No! No. No way. No.
-

33:25.505 --> 33:27.716
Do you think he's just gonna stay quiet
if we leave him?

33:27.799 --> 33:29.551
Listen to a doggy podcast or something?

33:32.637 --> 33:34.973
Great. Come on. All right. Come on.

33:37.892 --> 33:41.104
Do you want more?
Or you gonna tell us what we want to know?

33:47.027 --> 33:49.863
We both know the only reason
you flipped on your buddies

33:49.946 --> 33:52.115
was so you could rip them off
for their cut of the cash

33:52.198 --> 33:53.199
you took from the banks.

33:55.201 --> 33:58.830
Which, by my count, should be…
two million bucks, give or take.

34:01.207 --> 34:02.584
Now tell me where it is.

34:03.668 --> 34:05.670
What are you gonna do then?
Then you kill me?

34:06.796 --> 34:08.631
Listen to me, Larry.

34:08.715 --> 34:11.843
I'm not gonna kill you.
I just want the money.

34:12.927 --> 34:15.013
-Ah.
-If you don't talk, though…

34:15.096 --> 34:17.140
-We gotta get in there now.
- Just hold on.

34:17.223 --> 34:18.892
Hold up, cowboy.
We run in there, we get shot.

34:18.975 --> 34:21.394
I got it at my mom's place,
in a bowling bag in the garage.

34:21.478 --> 34:23.229
Yeah, we don't,
our witness gets shot.

34:23.313 --> 34:24.898
You said you weren't gonna kill me.

34:24.981 --> 34:27.484
Larry, Larry.
Of course I'm gonna kill you.

34:28.109 --> 34:30.904
Hang on. I got an idea.

34:34.949 --> 34:35.950
What the hell was that?

34:36.034 --> 34:37.202
Sounded like a noise.

34:38.161 --> 34:40.955
Yeah, idiot. I got that far.

34:41.748 --> 34:42.916
Go check it out!

34:43.917 --> 34:45.710
I don't know how you worked
with these meatheads.

34:45.794 --> 34:47.629
You gotta walk them
through every little thing.

34:48.380 --> 34:51.091
-US Marshals!
-Don't move!

34:51.883 --> 34:54.636
Easy, easy. This isn't what it looks like.

34:55.345 --> 34:56.429
Help me!

35:01.518 --> 35:03.520
-

35:03.603 --> 35:04.813
Get me out of here! You--

35:16.241 --> 35:17.659
Hooch!

35:23.164 --> 35:24.582
Now there's a dog?

35:27.335 --> 35:28.878
-

35:30.296 --> 35:32.424
Just shoot him!
He's behind a wooden box!

35:32.507 --> 35:34.050
Bullets go through wood!

35:38.430 --> 35:40.140
What kind of idiots are you?

35:41.224 --> 35:44.060
-Oh, no! Come on!
-

35:47.355 --> 35:49.315
-Whoa!
-

35:53.737 --> 35:55.155
Yes!

35:55.238 --> 35:56.990
-

35:59.993 --> 36:01.828
Finally. Some handcuffs.

36:01.911 --> 36:03.538
-

36:04.998 --> 36:06.750
Yo, Scott. You all right?

36:06.833 --> 36:09.336
-Yeah, I'm fine. Where's Long?
-You let him get away.

36:09.419 --> 36:12.213
Have you not been paying attention?
We just saved your life.

36:12.297 --> 36:13.423
Barely.

36:14.341 --> 36:17.385
-Jess, I gotta go after him.
-Yeah, go on. I'll get us some backup.

36:17.469 --> 36:21.097
Yeah, I also need assistance. The guy
on the ground in a zip tie and a chair.

36:22.182 --> 36:24.642
Go on, Hooch. Show me where he is.
Find him for me.

36:29.356 --> 36:30.732
It's over, Agent Long!

36:30.815 --> 36:31.816
Oh, ya think?

36:33.985 --> 36:36.112
Seems like it's just getting started.

36:38.156 --> 36:40.742
-You should've stayed out of it.
- Hooch, get back.

36:40.825 --> 36:43.244
Nobody was gonna get hurt
that didn't deserve it.

36:44.704 --> 36:46.831
Well, you're not getting out of here,
Agent Long.

36:46.915 --> 36:48.500
The police are already on their way.

36:48.583 --> 36:50.377
Well, you hear any sirens yet, smart guy?

36:54.881 --> 36:56.800
Get back. Hooch, get back.

36:56.883 --> 36:58.134
Look, you don't want to do this.

36:58.218 --> 37:02.972
Yeah, I do. I busted my ass
for a year chasing that scumbag.

37:04.516 --> 37:07.435
He walks with millions and a new life,
and what do I get?

37:07.519 --> 37:10.814
A divorce, a bunch of debts I can't pay.

37:10.897 --> 37:12.691
-What is it, Hooch?

37:14.484 --> 37:16.069
Is something…

37:27.831 --> 37:31.209
Alameda docks, by the ship cranes.
There's a gray Jeep parked nearby.

37:31.292 --> 37:32.502
Just get here, now.

37:37.507 --> 37:39.467
We gotta get out now.
The whole place is going up.

37:39.551 --> 37:43.304
Yeah, I can see that.
Let's go. Don't try anything.

37:48.560 --> 37:51.896
- Get down! Get down! Stay down!

37:51.980 --> 37:53.732
He came around front.
He's gonna trap us in here.

37:56.776 --> 37:58.445
And the place is exploding.

37:59.404 --> 38:01.322
Door number one's looking
like our only option.

38:07.370 --> 38:08.872
Jess, Hooch is faster than either of us,

38:08.955 --> 38:10.790
and he would love to take a bite
out of Agent Long.

38:11.541 --> 38:14.169
Long's gonna start shooting
the second that door opens.

38:14.252 --> 38:16.838
He's looking for me.
He's never gonna see Hooch.

38:19.674 --> 38:20.842
Hey, buddy.

38:21.843 --> 38:24.721
We're gonna go out there in a second.
It's gonna be dangerous.

38:24.804 --> 38:28.683
But I'm gonna be with you the whole way,
because I know you have my back.

38:30.477 --> 38:32.896
-I have your back too.

38:35.815 --> 38:37.442
Because you're my forever dog.

38:40.737 --> 38:41.863
No matter what.

38:48.995 --> 38:51.122
-You ready?
-

39:02.217 --> 39:03.426
No!

39:05.804 --> 39:07.389
-

39:09.474 --> 39:11.893
Drop it! Or you're dog food.

39:17.023 --> 39:20.443
-

39:26.533 --> 39:27.534
Good boy.

39:32.288 --> 39:33.873
Way to go, Turner.
-

39:33.957 --> 39:35.458
-All right, Baxter.
-Way to go, you two.

39:35.542 --> 39:37.585
All right, all right.
Hey, Chief wants to see us.

39:37.669 --> 39:39.045
-Okay.
-Hey, Turner.

39:42.757 --> 39:47.554
Ooh. A shaka from Xavier. Nice.
Took me a year to get one of those.

39:47.637 --> 39:50.098
I thought maybe he was telling me
I had a phone call.

39:51.558 --> 39:52.559
Glad you're here.

39:52.642 --> 39:53.893
Yeah…

39:56.062 --> 39:57.939
Is…
-Oh.

39:59.315 --> 40:01.359
Can… Can we stop this?

40:01.443 --> 40:03.695
-No.
-Hooch. Sit.

40:06.489 --> 40:07.782
Wow.

40:08.408 --> 40:09.909
I'm gonna start by saying in the future,

40:09.993 --> 40:12.203
when I say you're off the case,
you're off the case, understood?

40:12.287 --> 40:13.788
Yes, sir.

40:13.872 --> 40:16.249
That said, nice work.

40:16.332 --> 40:19.002
Got a call from Marshal Sickerman himself.

40:19.085 --> 40:20.170
He says thanks.

40:21.254 --> 40:23.506
Also, he's decided that--

40:25.050 --> 40:27.469
-What's his name?
-Hooch.

40:27.552 --> 40:28.386
Hooch?

40:29.387 --> 40:30.513
Because of Hooch's service

40:30.597 --> 40:33.600
and maybe because he took our friends
at the FBI down a peg,

40:33.683 --> 40:37.812
he's decided that the two of you
are a K-9 unit, effective immediately.

40:38.646 --> 40:43.026
Which is why I wanna…
talk to Ms. Mounir about training.

40:43.109 --> 40:48.323
Actually, sir, it's clear he has a lot
of training already from Scott's father.

40:48.948 --> 40:52.577
Unconventional, maybe,
but kind of amazing.

40:54.371 --> 40:56.373
Oh.
-Maybe I wasn't clear.

40:56.456 --> 40:59.834
I mean train him to stop doing anything
that involves dry-cleaning my pants.

41:00.919 --> 41:02.170
Right.

41:04.506 --> 41:07.467
Hey, hey. Come here. Come here, Hooch.

41:07.550 --> 41:11.304
We're gonna be a K-9 unit.
Does that sound good?

41:12.847 --> 41:17.560
-Oh, um, Erica. Hey, Erica. Hi.
-Hi.

41:17.644 --> 41:20.271
Before you go,
I just wanted to ask you something.

41:20.355 --> 41:22.232
-You do?
-Uh-huh.

41:22.315 --> 41:25.068
Oh. Uh, sure.

41:26.027 --> 41:28.446
Do you really believe those things
you said about Hooch?

41:29.614 --> 41:30.782
Oh, um…

41:33.284 --> 41:35.745
-Yeah. Yeah, I do.
-Yeah?

41:35.829 --> 41:39.833
He just needs someone who gets him,
sees how great he is.

41:41.001 --> 41:42.335
-I'm trying.
-

41:42.419 --> 41:43.795
-I really am.
-Yeah.

41:43.878 --> 41:46.297
These things, they take time.

41:46.965 --> 41:51.636
He's just not great at, uh…
picking up on signals.

41:52.262 --> 41:55.557
You hear that, Hooch?
You gotta pick up on signals, right?

41:55.640 --> 41:58.268
Gotta be aware
of what's right in front of your face.

42:01.354 --> 42:03.064
So, where do we start?

42:03.148 --> 42:05.483
Hooch got along really well
with Angel the other day.

42:05.567 --> 42:09.154
…if you want, he can train with her.

42:09.237 --> 42:10.405
And the other K-9 units.

42:10.488 --> 42:12.782
Yeah, great. Sounds good.

42:12.866 --> 42:15.660
Great. Wow, I-- I'm--

42:16.411 --> 42:19.039
Angel will be really excited
to work with him.

42:19.122 --> 42:21.082
Um… All right. Enjoy.

42:21.166 --> 42:23.251
Thank you. I will. Yeah.

42:23.335 --> 42:26.046
You hear that, Hooch?
You got a date, buddy.

42:31.134 --> 42:32.719
All right, Hooch. Listen up.

42:33.595 --> 42:37.223
Now that we're roommates and coworkers,
we need some rules, okay?

42:37.307 --> 42:40.018
Now, I know I said
that "forever dog" thing,

42:40.101 --> 42:43.188
but that doesn't mean
dog who does whatever he wants, okay?

42:43.271 --> 42:46.524
So that's the dog bed,
this is the people couch.

42:46.608 --> 42:48.902
Me here, you there.

42:48.985 --> 42:50.445
-Whoa, oh!

42:50.528 --> 42:53.531
-No, no. Stop. That's my phone.
-

42:53.615 --> 42:56.368
Hey, look. Unless you're gonna
grow hands, I gotta get that, right?

42:56.451 --> 42:57.452
Excuse me.

42:58.912 --> 42:59.913
Thank you.

43:00.955 --> 43:01.956
Hi, Laura.

43:02.040 --> 43:03.708
Hey, Scott. I'm at Mom's.

43:04.376 --> 43:05.835
Okay. Something wrong?

43:05.919 --> 43:08.171
You know how we've been
going through Dad's old things?

43:08.254 --> 43:09.255
I found something.

43:09.339 --> 43:10.632
What is it?

43:10.715 --> 43:11.925
All these files.

43:12.008 --> 43:15.470
I think Dad was working on a case
before the heart attack. Something big.

43:15.553 --> 43:16.971
What do you mean?

43:17.055 --> 43:21.393
There's all these notes and dozens
of police files on major criminals.

43:21.476 --> 43:23.353
Drug dealers, organized crime…

43:23.436 --> 43:24.771
Well, he was a cop.

43:24.854 --> 43:28.149
Scott, all of this was hidden
in the back of his closet.

43:28.233 --> 43:31.653
I think he was onto something scary enough
he didn't wanna tell anyone.

43:31.736 --> 43:35.782
And it looks like the only one with him
was Hooch.

43:39.285 --> 43:41.037
Okay. I, um…

43:42.122 --> 43:44.833
-We'll get out there as soon as we can.
-Thanks.

43:49.004 --> 43:50.547
Sure you can't talk, boy?

43:51.089 --> 43:52.507
Huh?

43:53.425 --> 43:56.970
Okay. Guess we're gonna
have to figure this out together.
