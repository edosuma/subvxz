YOUR NAME ON GOLF BALLS?

I'D USE IT.

THE TRASH FOR ME,

YEAH, MAYBE HE COULD
GO TO SCHOOL FOR YOU, TOO.

GET A "B" THIS YEAR.

01:53.514 --> 01:57.451
OKAY, BUT IT'S MY PICTURE
IN THE YEARBOOK.

I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT
THE LIST YOU GAVE ME, MAX.

02:02.022 --> 02:03.791

A CHRISTMAS LIST, TOO?

02:03.791 --> 02:05.226
WEEKS AGO,

02:05.226 --> 02:08.729
BUT I CAN'T FIND
THIS MONKEY CAGE GAME.

02:08.729 --> 02:12.433
IT'S NOT A GAME, DADDY.
IT'S AN ACTUAL CAGE.

02:12.433 --> 02:15.536
HE ASKED US
FOR A MONKEY.

02:15.536 --> 02:18.071
AH, THAT EXPLAINS
WHY HE WANTS DIAPERS

02:18.071 --> 02:20.908
AND A TINY ACCORDION.

02:20.908 --> 02:23.244
GOD, I HOPE SO.

02:23.244 --> 02:25.979
WELL, I'M NOT
AS GREEDY AS MAX.

A CORN DOG,

02:35.088 --> 02:37.325

IN THE WRONG PLACE.

02:38.959 --> 02:41.362
