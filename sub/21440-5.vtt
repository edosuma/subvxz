01:40.030 --> 01:41.830
Ulaz?

02:25.540 --> 02:27.790
Operation Kuron stage one successful.

02:27.910 --> 02:29.380
Begin stage two.

03:18.920 --> 03:20.880
Come on! Come on!

03:25.100 --> 03:27.310
Notify command headquarters.

03:27.390 --> 03:29.201
Operation Kuron stage

03:29.321 --> 03:31.203
three is underway.

05:36.480 --> 05:37.730
General Raht...

05:37.850 --> 05:39.776
I have an assignment for you.

05:39.896 --> 05:41.780
I serve in the name of Galra.

05:42.327 --> 05:45.932
I fear Lotor's focus
wavers since his return.

05:46.052 --> 05:47.876
I knew there was a risk in bringing

05:47.914 --> 05:49.820
him back after such a long absence.

05:49.910 --> 05:53.830
And I worry about the
path he leads us down.

05:54.815 --> 05:57.000
I need you to keep an eye on him.

05:57.080 --> 05:59.091
Follow his battle cruiser and report

05:59.211 --> 06:01.245
any suspicious behavior to me.

06:03.113 --> 06:04.760
Vrepit sa.

06:49.880 --> 06:51.390
What killed you?

08:16.090 --> 08:17.260
Help!

08:36.409 --> 08:38.870
This must be the one
that crashed the pod.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.106
Subject Y0XT39 has

08:48.226 --> 08:50.260
normal response to optic stimuli.

08:50.380 --> 08:52.880
Approved for use in Operation Kuron.

08:57.661 --> 08:59.838
Well, what's he saying?

08:59.958 --> 09:02.220
I can't tell, but he's coming out.

09:19.370 --> 09:22.040
- What's that noise?
- Let me check.

09:25.753 --> 09:26.960
He wakes.

09:27.564 --> 09:29.710
Remember to put the clamp on him?

09:29.790 --> 09:31.571
- Which clamp?
- The one that keeps his

09:31.691 --> 09:33.590
arm from turning into a weapon.

09:33.670 --> 09:37.180
- The red one?
- It's the only clamp we have! Ugh!

09:43.430 --> 09:46.520
Where am I? Why am I tied up?

09:46.600 --> 09:48.480
I say we eat him.

09:48.560 --> 09:51.770
- He doesn't look Galra.
- Does that mean we can't eat him?

09:51.860 --> 09:54.820
- We're not going to eat him.
- I'm not Galra.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.860
Even worse. He's a traitor.

09:56.950 --> 09:58.860
I'm not a...

10:01.120 --> 10:03.450
You're... You're rebel fighters.

10:03.540 --> 10:05.830
That's right. We stand
against the Galra.

10:05.910 --> 10:08.210
We haven't thrown our lot
in with them like you have!

10:08.290 --> 10:11.001
I'm not working with
them. I'm on your side.

10:11.121 --> 10:12.282
My name is Shiro.

10:12.402 --> 10:15.212
I'm a Paladin of Voltron,
but I was captured...

10:15.479 --> 10:16.600
I think.

10:16.720 --> 10:19.970
- I was fighting Zarkon.
- Fighting Zarkon?

10:21.890 --> 10:24.761
Right, and I'm the Phloban of Gargalax.

10:24.767 --> 10:27.565
Please, have you heard of Voltron?

10:27.640 --> 10:31.020
The lions. I need to know...
What happened to them?

10:31.100 --> 10:33.320
How much time has passed?

10:33.440 --> 10:35.197
The Galra have been sending scouts

10:35.317 --> 10:37.110
to try and flush us out for years.

10:37.230 --> 10:39.734
And now they send you to infiltrate us.

10:39.854 --> 10:41.570
Hmm, a joke.

10:41.660 --> 10:43.689
They didn't send me. I escaped.

10:43.695 --> 10:46.705
Escaped a Galra battle cruiser?

10:48.830 --> 10:52.234
- I'm not buying it!
- It's true. I took a pod.

10:52.354 --> 10:54.802
They fired at me. My pod took a hit.

10:54.922 --> 10:57.055
They wouldn't do that if I was friendly.

10:57.175 --> 10:59.085
Please, contact the Blade of Marmora

10:59.123 --> 11:01.680
or Voltron to verify my identity.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.519
And send a signal that
can be tracked? Uh, no.

11:05.978 --> 11:07.220
Look around you.

11:07.310 --> 11:10.060
Our food and supplies are
limited at this outpost.

11:10.180 --> 11:12.101
We have no problem watching you starve

11:12.221 --> 11:14.980
until you start telling the truth.

11:26.746 --> 11:28.561
Prince Lotor, that anomaly is

11:28.681 --> 11:30.540
registering on our scanners again.

11:30.620 --> 11:33.170
Get the coordinates. I want a visual.

11:43.220 --> 11:44.510
There's nothing.

11:44.590 --> 11:46.470
What are you expecting?

11:46.590 --> 11:48.352
I don't think three strange readings

11:48.472 --> 11:50.680
in a day are a coincidence.

11:50.770 --> 11:53.730
- We're being followed?
- We'd know.

11:53.850 --> 11:55.944
Not if they had our scanner protocols.

11:56.064 --> 11:58.280
They could counteract our measures.

11:58.360 --> 12:01.030
Who would know our protocols
other than the Galra?

12:02.183 --> 12:04.046
Bring up heat detectors and set blasters

12:04.166 --> 12:05.990
to fire around the anomaly.

12:06.070 --> 12:08.747
Around it? I say we hit it!

12:09.329 --> 12:11.830
I want to know who's after me.

12:21.470 --> 12:23.260
It is a Galra fighter.

12:25.260 --> 12:28.050
Let's invite our guest aboard.

12:32.140 --> 12:33.810
No!

12:42.848 --> 12:44.472
Prince Lotor requires

12:44.592 --> 12:46.216
your assistance on planet Thayserix.

12:46.336 --> 12:48.580
We expect you here immediately.

12:48.660 --> 12:51.914
- Thayserix? Where is that?
- Not far from here.

12:52.370 --> 12:54.249
The fleet is passing
through our quadrant.

12:54.369 --> 12:56.245
- Log it on the klygarg.
- Oh,

12:56.365 --> 12:59.170
I hate the klygarg.
How do I get on it again?

12:59.250 --> 13:01.449
- Enter your password.
- Right.

13:01.569 --> 13:04.130
- What's my password?
- I don't know! It's your password!

13:04.220 --> 13:06.501
I'm intercepting another
communication coming in now.

13:06.621 --> 13:07.825
Log this one, too.

13:07.945 --> 13:09.975
I haven't logged the first one!

13:10.060 --> 13:13.140
Shh!

13:15.640 --> 13:18.150
We've received orders from Prince Lotor.

13:18.230 --> 13:19.980
We are to intercept Voltron.

13:21.400 --> 13:24.400
Voltron? Uh...

13:24.490 --> 13:26.530
See if he's ready to talk.

13:29.070 --> 13:30.490
Huh?

13:30.580 --> 13:33.660
Ah! Vakala! Get in here!

13:33.750 --> 13:36.290
I told you we should have eaten him.

13:37.170 --> 13:39.250
His leg is hurt. He can't be far.

13:39.330 --> 13:41.920
Let's split up. I'll check outside.
You check the tunnels.

14:25.800 --> 14:27.720
Huh?

14:36.246 --> 14:38.038
I don't want to have to hurt you!

14:38.076 --> 14:39.770
Please stand down!

14:49.240 --> 14:51.251
You keep missing him! Let me shoot!

14:51.289 --> 14:52.660
Give me that!

14:52.780 --> 14:54.410
No, it's mine!

14:58.355 --> 15:00.830
Stop right there! I'll shoot!

15:11.243 --> 15:13.321
You're on the wrong side of this war.

15:15.752 --> 15:17.681
No, I'm not.

15:17.801 --> 15:19.680
I'm on your side.

15:19.800 --> 15:21.369
My name is Shiro,

15:21.489 --> 15:25.320
and like I said before,
I'm a Paladin of Voltron.

15:26.846 --> 15:29.575
I know that no matter what I
say, you won't believe me,

15:29.880 --> 15:30.957
so...

15:37.490 --> 15:39.450
Huh?

15:39.540 --> 15:40.540
Hmm?

15:41.169 --> 15:43.113
I need to get to my team

15:43.437 --> 15:45.460
and I need your help.

15:54.970 --> 15:57.623
There's Thayserix.
It's a giant gas planet.

15:57.743 --> 15:59.977
According to the
communications we intercepted,

16:00.097 --> 16:01.730
Voltron is there.

16:01.850 --> 16:03.065
Or was.

16:03.185 --> 16:04.594
I need to get there.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.829
- Do you have a ship?
- Just a shuttle.

16:06.949 --> 16:09.320
It's designed to dock
with low orbiting ships,

16:09.400 --> 16:11.190
not travel across the universe.

16:12.810 --> 16:15.746
Here. Sorry for hanging
you up by your wrists.

16:15.866 --> 16:17.046
Thanks.

16:17.166 --> 16:19.920
Sorry for hitting you in the
face with your friend's gun.

16:20.040 --> 16:21.135
Meh.

16:21.255 --> 16:23.960
Wasn't the first time it
happened. Won't be the last.

16:24.820 --> 16:26.482
Shiro, there just doesn't seem to

16:26.602 --> 16:28.420
be any way to get you to Thayserix.

16:29.614 --> 16:31.760
What about the Galra
cruiser heading there?

16:31.840 --> 16:33.083
What about it?

16:33.203 --> 16:35.318
Well, if it's passing close
enough to this planet,

16:35.438 --> 16:36.953
maybe I can hitch a ride.

16:37.363 --> 16:39.350
Hitch a ride on a Galra cruiser?

16:39.430 --> 16:41.730
You just escaped from a Galra ship,

16:41.810 --> 16:44.270
and now you're talking about
breaking back onto one?

16:44.350 --> 16:45.810
You're crazier than me.

16:45.900 --> 16:48.860
And I volunteered to live on
an ice planet for five years.

16:50.150 --> 16:52.110
Is it possible or not?

16:56.200 --> 16:58.410
The cruiser is currently within range,

16:58.490 --> 17:01.290
but it's gonna make a jump
to hyper-drive any time now.

17:01.370 --> 17:02.950
Then I'd better hurry.

17:18.300 --> 17:20.510
Thank you for all your help.

17:38.012 --> 17:39.985
Do you really think he'll be able to get

17:40.105 --> 17:41.790
to a fighter and make it to Voltron?

17:41.910 --> 17:43.874
If he's really who he says he is,

17:43.994 --> 17:45.628
then he's got a chance.

17:46.370 --> 17:49.080
You know that was our only ship, right?

17:54.950 --> 17:57.880
The battle cruiser's sensor
will identify the shuttle

17:57.970 --> 17:59.630
once it gets within range.

17:59.750 --> 18:01.816
The single shuttle is
such a small object

18:01.936 --> 18:03.947
that the bridge won't be notified.

18:04.376 --> 18:06.092
Its defense system is programmed to

18:06.212 --> 18:07.989
destroy on sight.

18:18.450 --> 18:21.443
At this point, the sensors
will ID you as debris.

18:21.563 --> 18:23.225
You must move quickly.

18:23.345 --> 18:24.790
Make your way to the blasters.

18:24.910 --> 18:26.290
That's where you'll get in.

18:26.370 --> 18:30.040
These weapons retract
just before hyper-drive.

18:41.519 --> 18:44.135
Exiting hyper-drive. Shields up.

18:44.255 --> 18:45.736
We're under attack!

18:45.856 --> 18:48.730
We have a visual on Voltron.
Voltron is within range.

18:48.810 --> 18:49.964
Voltron?

18:53.020 --> 18:55.530
Prepare Fighter Squadron One
for immediate deployment.

19:07.000 --> 19:09.870
Come on. Send the fighters. Let's go!

19:11.420 --> 19:13.130
Voltron is out of range.

19:13.210 --> 19:16.710
Fighters, abort launch.
I repeat, abort launch.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.050
It's now or never.

19:37.940 --> 19:39.690
Voltron!

19:44.870 --> 19:46.370
Come on, move!

19:46.450 --> 19:48.450
Oh, he's too fast for me!

19:54.920 --> 19:56.420
No!

20:18.690 --> 20:21.280
Stop sending your cronies after me.

20:21.400 --> 20:24.130
I know many ideas float
through your head,

20:24.250 --> 20:25.950
just like your father,

20:26.030 --> 20:28.589
but the Galra Empire
needs your leadership

20:28.627 --> 20:30.500
in these troubling times.

20:30.620 --> 20:32.830
I am the leader!

20:34.536 --> 20:37.790
But I am not my father.

20:51.310 --> 20:55.480
Pilot log. I am one
day out of Thayserix.

20:55.560 --> 20:58.860
I've lost visual and radar
contact to Voltron.

20:58.940 --> 21:01.860
I'm continuing course
on the same heading.

21:07.240 --> 21:09.660
I am four days out from Thayserix.

21:10.450 --> 21:12.160
No food or water.

21:12.910 --> 21:14.910
SOS ping is active.

21:15.960 --> 21:18.210
No signs of anyone.

21:23.590 --> 21:25.550
I am seven days out.

21:26.470 --> 21:28.720
Oxygen levels are low.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.180
And fuel is... gone.

21:33.390 --> 21:36.770
This will be my last entry.

22:06.050 --> 22:08.300
What's wrong?

22:15.680 --> 22:17.310
We found him.
