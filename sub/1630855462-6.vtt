WEBVTT

00:08.660 --> 00:10.271
Extraordinary.

00:10.271 --> 00:13.404
You will want
to get this on camera. Ha!

00:13.404 --> 00:15.319
Quickly. Gizmo!

00:15.319 --> 00:17.974
Gizmo? Gizmo, get up.

00:17.974 --> 00:20.281
- Yeah? Yeah?
- Where's Nandor?

00:20.281 --> 00:22.326
Um, I think he's, uh, indisposed

00:22.326 --> 00:24.459
at the moment, um,
in his bedroom.

00:24.459 --> 00:27.940
Ha, shaking hands with Rosie
Palmer and her five milkmaids.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.725
- What?
- What? Follow me.

00:29.725 --> 00:31.727
<i>Laszlo's still
the only one who knows</i>

00:31.727 --> 00:34.382
<i>I'm half-vampire and he's been
doing experiments to help.</i>

00:34.382 --> 00:36.819
Happy to report that
there's been some progress.

00:36.819 --> 00:39.604
My telekinesis
has gotten better.

00:44.174 --> 00:46.437
Pretty cool, huh?

00:46.437 --> 00:49.745
I have discovered something
wonderful with the frogs

00:49.745 --> 00:51.268
- that I injected
with your blood.
- Wait,

00:51.268 --> 00:53.053
you-you did what with my blood?

00:55.925 --> 00:57.492
- Why are they so hairy?

00:57.492 --> 00:59.189
Well, why are you so hairy?
Who cares?

00:59.189 --> 01:01.278
- Now, bon voyage.
- What? No!

01:01.278 --> 01:02.323
Those poor frogs!

01:08.677 --> 01:10.070
Shit.

01:12.463 --> 01:14.770
- Come on, little guy,
come on, you can do it.
- Shh!

01:16.250 --> 01:17.164
- Your turn.
- To do what?

01:17.164 --> 01:18.339
I want you

01:18.339 --> 01:19.905
to leap off that balcony.

01:19.905 --> 01:21.211
What?

01:21.211 --> 01:22.865
No, I'll break my legs.

01:22.865 --> 01:24.867
- Bullshit. You saw those frogs.
- Yeah.

01:24.867 --> 01:27.130
They were transformed
by your blood, they flew.

01:27.130 --> 01:29.001
Ipso facto, shithead...

01:30.394 --> 01:31.787
...so can you.

01:31.787 --> 01:33.441
But what if I can't?

01:33.441 --> 01:35.095
Yeah, but what if you can?

01:35.095 --> 01:36.748
What if you can?

01:38.185 --> 01:39.795
- That would be pretty cool.
- It would be

01:39.795 --> 01:42.058
very cool.
Now, I calculate

01:42.058 --> 01:44.016
we have exactly
two minutes before

01:44.016 --> 01:46.193
Nandor finishes
making pearl jam.

01:46.193 --> 01:48.760
- Right.
- So I'll see you at the bottom.

01:48.760 --> 01:50.458
As the actress said
to the bishop.

01:50.458 --> 01:52.199
Come on, Guillermo.

01:52.199 --> 01:55.027
I believe in you
and I love you, Guillermo.

01:55.027 --> 01:56.377
Come on, Gizmo, let her rip.

01:56.377 --> 01:58.509
Launch yourself forward,
see what happens.

01:58.509 --> 02:00.772
- We should practice
closer to the floor first.
- No.

02:00.772 --> 02:02.078
No, no, no. You will never fly

02:02.078 --> 02:04.036
unless you need to. Panic is

02:04.036 --> 02:05.516
the secret ingredient.
Now, come on.

02:10.173 --> 02:12.088
Aah--

02:14.046 --> 02:16.745
I'm doing it!

02:16.745 --> 02:18.138
-  Guillermo?
- Yes, Master--

02:20.140 --> 02:22.707
- That's how we all learned.

02:24.883 --> 02:27.190
<i>♪ Don't sing if you want
to live long ♪</i>

02:27.190 --> 02:29.888
<i>♪ They have no use

02:29.888 --> 02:32.326
<i>♪ You're dead, you're dead,

02:45.165 --> 02:47.036
<i>♪ You're dead

02:59.701 --> 03:01.181
What is this screaming?
Is someone squeezing a snake?

03:01.181 --> 03:02.965
Oh.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.315
- Fucking hell.
-  What happened?

03:05.315 --> 03:07.230
Well, I don't know. I was in
the library. Don't look at me.

03:07.230 --> 03:08.840
Does it hurt?

03:08.840 --> 03:10.929
Because it looks
like it really hurts.

03:10.929 --> 03:12.801
- Hey, boners.
-  What?

03:12.801 --> 03:14.194
Nice shiner, Colin Robinson.

03:14.194 --> 03:17.284
Hey, look at this dude.

03:17.284 --> 03:18.937
Someone's had
an interesting evening.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.417
- Please help me.
-  Wow.

03:20.417 --> 03:22.114
What happened to dingus' foot?

03:22.114 --> 03:23.377
Who gives a fuck?

03:23.377 --> 03:24.987
Tell us what happened
to your blackened eye.

03:24.987 --> 03:26.380
Yes, was it fisticuffs?

03:26.380 --> 03:28.164
Did you get kicked by a donkey?

03:28.164 --> 03:29.992
Stop guessing
and stop grabbing me.

03:29.992 --> 03:31.820
This is the problem.

03:31.820 --> 03:33.735
Take it easy, summer breezy.

03:33.735 --> 03:35.867
Every time
I go to drain someone,

03:35.867 --> 03:38.218
they see my black eye
and want to know what happened.

03:38.218 --> 03:41.003
All of a sudden, I'm too...
G-damn interesting

03:41.003 --> 03:42.134
to drain anyone.

03:42.134 --> 03:44.006
- What the fuck?
-  Really?

03:44.006 --> 03:45.703
You think you are
<i>too</i> interesting?

03:45.703 --> 03:47.749
I know I am. I mean,

03:47.749 --> 03:49.316
this exact same thing happened
when I came back from Vietnam.

03:49.316 --> 03:51.361
Whoa.

03:51.361 --> 03:54.190
- You were in 'Nam?
-  Well, thank you
for your service.

03:54.190 --> 03:56.801
Colin Robinson, I had
no idea you were in the Army.

03:56.801 --> 03:58.412
Oh, I-I wasn't in the Army.

03:58.412 --> 04:00.022
About six years ago,

04:00.022 --> 04:01.806
I took a cycling trip
with Backroads.

04:01.806 --> 04:03.852
- On the third day, we found

04:03.852 --> 04:05.680
a dead body. In a tree.

04:05.680 --> 04:06.724
No kidding?

04:06.724 --> 04:09.031
With an ox's asshole

04:09.031 --> 04:11.686
around its neck like a necklace.

04:11.686 --> 04:13.427
- What?
- How did that happen?

04:13.427 --> 04:16.125
Some poor farmer and his ox
must've stepped

04:16.125 --> 04:18.040
on a decommissioned
land mine and...

04:18.040 --> 04:20.390
blew him up into the tree
and the ox's

04:20.390 --> 04:22.174
asshole must've
landed on his head.

04:22.174 --> 04:23.785
-  Good grief.
- Fascinating.

04:23.785 --> 04:25.700
I wasn't expecting that ending.

04:25.700 --> 04:28.006
See? It's the black eye-- makes

04:28.006 --> 04:29.486
- my stories too interesting.
- Do you think

04:29.486 --> 04:31.923
that your black eye also has
a very interesting story?

04:31.923 --> 04:35.275
Unfortunately, yes,
it's fucking remarkable.

04:35.275 --> 04:36.363
But this is Colin Robinson.

04:36.363 --> 04:37.842
I mean, he can't have any more

04:37.842 --> 04:39.757
fascinating stories in him.

04:39.757 --> 04:42.891
Gee, you tell me.
A five-pound frozen block

04:42.891 --> 04:45.850
of shit and piss
fall off a plane, landing

04:45.850 --> 04:48.418
- on a 308 Ferrari
-  No way.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.986
and blowing the sideview mirror
right into my kisser.

04:50.986 --> 04:52.770
Well, fuck my old boots.

04:52.770 --> 04:54.511
Son of a bitch!

04:54.511 --> 04:57.340
- Frozen blocks
of pisses and shits?
-  Yes.

04:57.340 --> 04:58.820
- What will they think of next?

04:58.820 --> 05:01.039
Guillermo, oi...

05:01.039 --> 05:03.172
No, fuck this,
I want to stay here

05:03.172 --> 05:05.087
and listen
to his wonderful stories.

05:05.087 --> 05:07.785
- Yes, me too.
- Guillermo is your familiar.

05:07.785 --> 05:09.744
I just went to get him
new trousers a year ago.

05:09.744 --> 05:11.136
It is your turn.

05:11.136 --> 05:13.095
Fine. Fuck it. Whatever.

05:13.095 --> 05:15.271
Okay, Guillermo,
stop lying around.

05:15.271 --> 05:17.404
Let's get that
of yours looked at.

05:17.404 --> 05:19.884
Come on, boys, to the lab.

05:19.884 --> 05:22.234
- Tell me more
about this ox's anus.
-  It really hurts.

05:22.234 --> 05:24.019
Okay already,
I said we're going.

05:24.019 --> 05:26.064
Oh! Laszlo, my love,

05:26.064 --> 05:27.762
did you just see a hairy frog?

05:27.762 --> 05:29.285
The only hairy frog
I'm interested in,

05:29.285 --> 05:31.679
my darling,
is the one between your legs.

05:31.679 --> 05:32.854
It's not just a frog.

05:32.854 --> 05:34.899
- It's the whole swamp.
- True.

05:34.899 --> 05:36.684
Come on.

05:36.684 --> 05:38.207
Off you go, my love.

05:42.298 --> 05:44.779
Where are you?
Come on, boy.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.824
Come on, boy.
Where the fuck are you,

05:46.824 --> 05:48.391
you fucking frog?

05:48.391 --> 05:50.785
Are either of you
allergic to penicillin?

05:50.785 --> 05:52.352
- No.
- What is that?

05:52.352 --> 05:54.310
Just ragweed

05:54.310 --> 05:56.225
- and chewing gum.
- Chewing gum?

05:56.225 --> 05:58.749
- How unusual.
- That is unusual.
- Guys, guys.

05:58.749 --> 06:00.185
You're literally killing me.

06:00.185 --> 06:02.710
Right, let's crack on.
When I flick this switch,

06:02.710 --> 06:03.972
the lights will flash,
there'll be a horrible noise

06:03.972 --> 06:05.277
and a terrible odor

06:05.277 --> 06:07.018
as I transfer
the life energy from Nandor

06:07.018 --> 06:08.977
into Colin Robinson.

06:08.977 --> 06:10.979
Sorry, Laszlo,
I do have one question.

06:10.979 --> 06:12.937
-  Which is?
- Will it hurt?

06:12.937 --> 06:14.417
Pain like you've never known.

06:14.417 --> 06:16.680
And furthermore, if you're
overdrained, you could die.

06:16.680 --> 06:17.942
Fuck this, I'm out.

06:17.942 --> 06:19.161
- What?
- W-Wait a minute.

06:19.161 --> 06:20.728
I'm starving.

06:20.728 --> 06:22.338
And you will be fed,
Colin Robinson.

06:22.338 --> 06:24.427
But I think we should revert
to our original plan.

06:24.427 --> 06:27.038
- The original plan? Are you mad?
-  I think
it's a pretty good plan.

06:27.038 --> 06:28.649
We cover your black eye
with makeup

06:28.649 --> 06:30.215
and make you boring again.

06:30.215 --> 06:32.392
It does seem a lot simpler.

06:32.392 --> 06:34.437
- Let's do that.
-  All right.

06:34.437 --> 06:36.308
- Cowards.
-  Makes sense.

06:36.308 --> 06:39.094
Turn your back on science
at your own peril.

06:39.094 --> 06:41.052
- We'll take our chances.
Thank you, Laszlo.
- Yeah.

06:41.052 --> 06:43.011
Seriously, Nadja,

06:43.011 --> 06:45.013
I don't need urgent care.
I can just sleep it off.

06:45.013 --> 06:46.754
Do you really think
I want to doing this?

06:46.754 --> 06:48.712
If it was up to me, I would have
just packed your ankle

06:48.712 --> 06:50.671
in some mud made from fish piss

06:50.671 --> 06:52.237
and fed you some
pickled pig's ears.

06:52.237 --> 06:55.110
But, no, my husband
thinks a doctor is better.

06:55.110 --> 06:57.417
"Trust the science, my darling."

06:57.417 --> 06:59.201
-  <i>I don't know
what's going on</i>

06:59.201 --> 07:01.029
with my body right now,
but if a doctor finds out

07:01.029 --> 07:03.205
that I'm almost a vampire,
I'm a dead man.

07:03.205 --> 07:05.381
And if Nadja finds out,
it'll be worse, so--

07:05.381 --> 07:07.296
- Stop squirming, Guillermo,
we're very close now.

07:07.296 --> 07:09.298
No, you know what?
I feel a lot better.

07:09.298 --> 07:11.996
The vampire doctor is going
to fix your mangled foot.

07:11.996 --> 07:13.955
What? You said
we were going to urgent care.

07:13.955 --> 07:15.260
Yes, Familiar Urgent Care, silly.

07:15.260 --> 07:17.915
No. No, Nadja, no!

07:20.004 --> 07:24.531
Oh, just look at all
these people to feed from.

07:24.531 --> 07:27.316
I don't know, I kind of
feel like I want go home

07:27.316 --> 07:30.058
- and take the train
to sleepy town.
- No!

07:30.058 --> 07:32.234
It would be a sleep of death.

07:32.234 --> 07:34.323
Just take a look
at all these losers, hmm?

07:34.323 --> 07:36.194
Outdoor diners.

07:36.194 --> 07:38.283
- They do deserve it.
-  Yes.

07:38.283 --> 07:40.155
- Great start.
- Uh, excuse me.

07:40.155 --> 07:42.070
Hello.

07:42.070 --> 07:44.376
I notice you have a d...
Oh. Ooh.

07:44.376 --> 07:46.204
- You got this.
-  Doggie bag.

07:46.204 --> 07:49.251
Interesting story
about how the...

07:49.251 --> 07:52.080
origin of the doggie bag started.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.257
It was actually a-- Ow!

07:55.257 --> 07:56.998
-  Oh, shit!
-  Son of a bitch!

07:56.998 --> 07:59.522
World War II, they would

07:59.522 --> 08:01.350
- take food home for their dog
-  Did you see that?

08:01.350 --> 08:03.570
- instead of wasting it.

08:03.570 --> 08:05.093
<i>Don't look at me!</i>

08:05.093 --> 08:06.529
<i>This isn't interesting.</i>

08:06.529 --> 08:08.183
What have you done?

08:08.183 --> 08:10.664
Someone ran over my foot,
shithead. It hurt.

08:10.664 --> 08:13.449
- Tell them to go away.
- Nothing interesting here.
Keep moving, please.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.451
<i>Stop filming me!</i>

08:15.451 --> 08:17.322
- Are you okay?
- No, I'm not okay.
- Shoo!

08:17.322 --> 08:19.194
He needs privacy.

08:19.194 --> 08:21.370
- It is fine.
-  Nandor, take me home.

08:21.370 --> 08:22.458
I'm taking you home.
We're gonna go home.

08:22.458 --> 08:24.634
Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.
Are you okay?

08:24.634 --> 08:26.549
- No!
-  What the fuck?
That's the dude from <i>Mad Men.</i>

08:26.549 --> 08:28.029
<i>Oh, for fuck's sake.</i>

08:28.029 --> 08:29.465
<i>Oh, where's your martini, bud?</i>

08:29.465 --> 08:31.162
- Hi.
-  You got to
be kidding me.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.990
<i>Damn, you just
got hit by John Slattery.</i>

08:32.990 --> 08:34.209
<i>- That is crazy.
- What the heck happened?</i>

08:34.209 --> 08:36.037
You stepped off the curb
without even looking.

08:36.037 --> 08:37.691
What happened
is you ran over my foot!

08:37.691 --> 08:39.606
We really need to go.
My friend is not well.

08:39.606 --> 08:41.216
Let me drive you
to the hospital. I-I just

08:41.216 --> 08:42.565
played a-a doctor on a season
of <i>The Good Fight.</i>

08:42.565 --> 08:43.914
They love me over there.

08:43.914 --> 08:45.350
<i>That was a really good episode.</i>

08:45.350 --> 08:47.265
It doesn't even
really hurt that much

08:47.265 --> 08:48.702
- anymore.
- Well, I'll-I'll
drive you home, please?

08:48.702 --> 08:50.486
- It's the least I can do.
- You know what?

08:50.486 --> 08:52.401
We will accept
your generous offer.

08:52.401 --> 08:53.663
- Yes, yes.
- What the fuck are you doing?

08:53.663 --> 08:55.230
Hey, John, over here.

08:55.230 --> 08:56.971
We will be in that car alone

08:56.971 --> 08:58.450
with this gentleman
that owes you a debt.

08:58.450 --> 09:00.148
<i>Which you will collect</i>

09:00.148 --> 09:02.150
<i>by feeding.</i>

09:02.150 --> 09:04.065
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

09:04.065 --> 09:06.894
<i>John Slattery coming to the aid
of the guy he just ran over.</i>

09:06.894 --> 09:08.591
- Shotgun left.
- Fuck!

09:08.591 --> 09:10.941
- John Slattery, please.
-  You're a hero, John.

09:10.941 --> 09:12.464
-  One of the greats.
-  He's not
one of the greats.

09:12.464 --> 09:14.336
- He's a reckless driver.
-  You're a reckless

09:14.336 --> 09:15.511
- walker.
- Peasants, disperse!

09:15.511 --> 09:16.904
- Begone!
-  He call us peasants?

09:16.904 --> 09:19.602
-  Oh, rude.

09:19.602 --> 09:21.430
Animal hospital? Why
are we-why are we going here?

09:21.430 --> 09:24.128
Ow!

09:24.128 --> 09:26.304
-  This is for pets.
I'm not a dog.
- Shh! Potato, "potahto."

09:26.304 --> 09:28.959
Um, yes, hello,
um, I've got a broken familiar.

09:28.959 --> 09:31.396
- So, you're gonna want
to go around that corner--
- Yeah, I've been here before.

09:31.396 --> 09:34.182
There is nothing to see here.

09:34.182 --> 09:37.533
It is just a Doberman
with a floppy tail.

09:38.969 --> 09:40.188
- Hold on tight.
- Wait, where are we going?

09:40.188 --> 09:41.493
- Uh, through the wall.
- No, no stop!

09:41.493 --> 09:43.104
- That's a solid wall.
- No, it's not.

09:43.104 --> 09:47.151
No. No! No!
Okay.

09:47.151 --> 09:49.153
- That was kind of cool.
- It's just a common cold,
so there's gonna be sneezing

09:49.153 --> 09:52.243
and coughing and that
is gonna be a burden on you,

09:52.243 --> 09:55.986
so I have a recommendation.
And that is put her down.

09:55.986 --> 09:58.423
- Oh, gosh, you really think so?
-  Even if she recovers

09:58.423 --> 10:01.165
from this cold, she's...

10:01.165 --> 10:03.037
good God, she's, like,
almost 40.

10:03.037 --> 10:04.952
She might squeeze out
a few more good years,

10:04.952 --> 10:06.649
but we're talking
quality of life.

10:06.649 --> 10:08.390
Okay, let's do it.

10:08.390 --> 10:10.174
No, fuck this. I'm out of here.

10:10.174 --> 10:12.002
Oh, calm, down, it'll be okay.

10:12.002 --> 10:13.482
No!

10:15.484 --> 10:18.269
- Thanks, guys.
-  Sedate him, Jack.
- No.

10:18.269 --> 10:19.488
-  Fantastic.
-  That's it.

10:19.488 --> 10:21.142
Aw.

10:21.142 --> 10:22.970
Sweet dreams, Guillermo.

10:22.970 --> 10:24.580
-  Yeah, perfect.

10:24.580 --> 10:27.104
You, uh, you okay back there?

10:27.104 --> 10:29.237
You look like shit.

10:29.237 --> 10:31.500
Well, yeah, I mean,
you ran over my foot.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.503
Sorry about all the cell phone
pictures and stuff.

10:34.503 --> 10:36.026
You know, you would
that people in New York

10:36.026 --> 10:37.637
would have seen
a famous actor before.

10:37.637 --> 10:39.508
It is quite all right,
John Slattery.

10:39.508 --> 10:41.728
You have our gratitude.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.773
Drain him.

10:43.773 --> 10:45.688
Do you find it, uh, difficult?

10:45.688 --> 10:48.038
What?

10:48.038 --> 10:50.127
Do you find it difficult

10:50.127 --> 10:52.129
being an older actor?

10:52.129 --> 10:54.349
Having to memorize lines?

10:54.349 --> 10:56.351
Especially
when you've been drinking.

10:56.351 --> 10:58.483
Slattery-- that's
an Irish name, right?

10:58.483 --> 11:00.616
Wait, s-say
that last part again.

11:00.616 --> 11:02.923
What, "Slattery's
an Irish name"?

11:02.923 --> 11:06.230
I mean, I personally
don't mind the Irish.

11:06.230 --> 11:09.146
But I just don't like it when
they try to sound intelligent.

11:09.146 --> 11:11.627
Huh, wow.

11:11.627 --> 11:14.717
I could listen
to you talk for hours.

11:14.717 --> 11:17.328
- Exsqueeze me?
- I mean, not to what you're
saying, but to that accent.

11:17.328 --> 11:19.722
It's just so specific.
Where are you from?

11:19.722 --> 11:21.506
- Well...
- Wait, wait, wait,
don't tell me. Upper Midwest.

11:21.506 --> 11:24.292
For sure. Uh, Wisconsin?

11:24.292 --> 11:26.207
But not eastern Wisconsin,
that would have more of

11:26.207 --> 11:28.383
a Germanic influence to it,
am I right?

11:28.383 --> 11:30.994
Are you, like, prepping
for a role or something?

11:30.994 --> 11:33.344
No, this isn't for a role.
I just love accents.

11:33.344 --> 11:35.303
People are just
walking stories, you know?

11:35.303 --> 11:38.349
In all their fascination
and specificity.

11:38.349 --> 11:39.481
You ever see
the movie <i>Spotlight?</i>

11:39.481 --> 11:42.353
About the <i>Boston Globe</i> reporters

11:42.353 --> 11:46.096
who uncovered the sexual abuse
coverup in the Catholic church?

11:46.096 --> 11:48.229
- Yeah, exactly.
- No.

11:48.229 --> 11:50.231
Oh. Well, in that
I played Ben Bradlee, Jr.

11:50.231 --> 11:52.276
And that character begins
with the accent,

11:52.276 --> 11:54.714
because the real Bradlee
is from Boston.

11:54.714 --> 11:57.412
But he's an upper-crust guy.

11:57.412 --> 11:58.543
Not like some jamoke standing

11:58.543 --> 12:00.284
around Kelly's Tavern

12:00.284 --> 12:02.286
in, uh, Revere Beach,
you know what I mean?

12:02.286 --> 12:04.071
- Very good, John Slattery.
-  Not bad, right?

12:04.071 --> 12:06.290
- But I was talking to him.
- Oh.

12:06.290 --> 12:08.249
You know, it's funny, I had this
babysitter when I was a kid.

12:08.249 --> 12:09.990
She was Irish.
Her name was Vivian.

12:09.990 --> 12:12.470
But again, sorry for your loss.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.559
She was just a familiar,
but thank you.

12:14.559 --> 12:16.953
It is kind of nice
to think of Cathy

12:16.953 --> 12:18.650
on that rainbow bridge,

12:18.650 --> 12:20.609
doing stuff with
her familiar friends.

12:20.609 --> 12:23.264
Having spaghetti or whatever
it is they dream of doing.

12:23.264 --> 12:25.527
Well, they're
in a better place now.

12:25.527 --> 12:27.398
- Yes.
-  I wish I was.

12:27.398 --> 12:30.053
- I'm looking for a Nadja.
-  Oh, yes.

12:30.053 --> 12:32.186
- Please, can we go?
- Well,

12:32.186 --> 12:34.057
Guillermo's ankle
is healing up nicely,

12:34.057 --> 12:36.451
which is very unusual, so...

12:36.451 --> 12:39.323
just to be safe...
I say we put him down.

12:39.323 --> 12:40.672
He could break that ankle again,

12:40.672 --> 12:42.500
he could break
the other ankle or

12:42.500 --> 12:44.372
- he could just bitch a lot.
- Hmm.

12:44.372 --> 12:46.243
Think we're just gonna
take him home.

12:46.243 --> 12:48.158
All right.
Well, that is your choice.

12:48.158 --> 12:50.160
- Yes.
- Oh, there's one more thing.

12:50.160 --> 12:52.641
The results of that blood work
came back and they're very odd,

12:52.641 --> 12:55.165
so I'm just gonna have it
retested, will not take long.

12:55.165 --> 12:57.951
I promise I'm gonna get you
out of here well before sunrise.

12:59.126 --> 13:00.605
<i>Now I'm thinking,</i>

13:00.605 --> 13:02.607
<i>"They're going to
test him again?"</i>

13:02.607 --> 13:04.261
What if they find
that Van Helsing muck

13:04.261 --> 13:05.654
in his blood?

13:05.654 --> 13:07.134
I'm going to have to
get him out of here.

13:08.352 --> 13:09.963
<i>Why are we heading towards</i>

13:09.963 --> 13:11.660
the Verrazzano Bridge?

13:11.660 --> 13:14.445
Uh, are you-are you
taking us to Brooklyn?

13:14.445 --> 13:16.447
Are you taking
us to Brooklyn? Are you...

13:16.447 --> 13:17.709
That-- It's really-- That's
a tough one. It's got kind

13:17.709 --> 13:19.407
of a twang to it.
Say something else.

13:19.407 --> 13:21.322
I don't want to go to Brooklyn.

13:21.322 --> 13:22.976
I don't want to go to Brooklyn?

13:22.976 --> 13:24.499
There's
a little bit of an uptalk there.

13:24.499 --> 13:26.196
I don't want to go to Brooklyn?

13:26.196 --> 13:27.154
- Can you let us out right h--
-  Can you

13:27.154 --> 13:29.243
let us out right here, please?

13:29.243 --> 13:30.026
You also have these interesting

13:30.026 --> 13:31.549
pauses in your speech, but

13:31.549 --> 13:34.248
I can't tell if they're regional
or uniquely you or...

13:34.248 --> 13:36.032
It's just the most
interesting accent

13:36.032 --> 13:38.034
- I've ever heard.
- Okay, fuck this.

13:38.034 --> 13:39.601
<i>I mean, where are you from?
I'm sorry, guys. That's kind of</i>

13:39.601 --> 13:41.516
<i>mean, right? I'm not trying
to make fun of you,</i>

13:41.516 --> 13:42.604
<i>I'm just trying to get it
in my head, you know,</i>

13:42.604 --> 13:44.171
<i>it's all about muscle memory.</i>

13:44.171 --> 13:45.520
Guillermo?

13:45.520 --> 13:47.739
Guillermo!

13:47.739 --> 13:50.220
Guillermo, why the hell
are you wearing a dress?

13:50.220 --> 13:53.006
Hey, Nandor, you made it.
Hey, girl.

13:53.006 --> 13:54.529
Get your shit together,
we got to go.

13:54.529 --> 13:56.531
No, I want to lie down.
You know they gave me

13:56.531 --> 13:59.055
some relax and it's making me
feel very medicine.

13:59.055 --> 14:01.014
They are testing your blood

14:01.014 --> 14:03.233
and they're going to find
your Van Helsing germs

14:03.233 --> 14:05.105
and whatever else you've
got going on in there and then

14:05.105 --> 14:07.194
- they're going to kill you,
so let's go!
- That sounds serious.

14:07.194 --> 14:08.586
Can I say something?

14:08.586 --> 14:11.024
- Nadja?
- What?

14:11.024 --> 14:13.896
I think you're wonderful
and I love-- Ow!

14:13.896 --> 14:17.160
You're a crazy bitch.
But I love you.

14:17.160 --> 14:18.901
You know who else I love
is Laszlo.

14:18.901 --> 14:20.990
But he's a horny little bitch.

14:20.990 --> 14:23.036
I also love Colin Robinson.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.951
He's, like,
a little boring bitch.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.561
Like, he's like an LBB.

14:26.561 --> 14:29.607
But, you know, the one I love
the most is actually Nandor.

14:29.607 --> 14:31.696
- Because he's, like,
the queen bitch.

14:31.696 --> 14:33.263
- Is that crazy?

14:33.263 --> 14:34.699
Hey. Who's that bitch?

14:34.699 --> 14:37.615
Wow, you are
such a miracle worker.

14:37.615 --> 14:39.704
He is back to a red, shiny,

14:39.704 --> 14:42.011
fresh apple, so,
think we're gonna get

14:42.011 --> 14:43.230
- the ol' dog home now.
- Yeah.

14:43.230 --> 14:44.579
I don't think
that's gonna happen.

14:44.579 --> 14:45.536
I have a question for you.

14:45.536 --> 14:47.364
Who turned him?

14:47.364 --> 14:48.931
Who what?

14:48.931 --> 14:50.977
According to his blood,

14:50.977 --> 14:52.674
this familiar has been turned
into a vampire.

14:52.674 --> 14:55.459
Yes, it's early stages,
but he is well on his way.

14:55.459 --> 14:57.548
No, I'm sorry,
there's been a huge mistake.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.290
Are you regretting turning him?
Because if you are,

15:00.290 --> 15:02.118
you should have thought
of that before you did it.

15:02.118 --> 15:03.990
- Guillermo?
- Yeah.

15:03.990 --> 15:05.426
- A vampire?
- Yes.

15:05.426 --> 15:06.514
That thing?

15:06.514 --> 15:08.429
That loser is a vampire?

15:08.429 --> 15:10.083
Absolutely not.

15:10.083 --> 15:11.432
Have you seen how lame he is?

15:11.432 --> 15:12.563
Science does not lie.

15:12.563 --> 15:14.000
Now, it must be recent

15:14.000 --> 15:15.523
because he's still transforming.

15:15.523 --> 15:18.439
No one in our house
would do such a thing.

15:18.439 --> 15:20.571
Well, then we have
a very big problem, 'cause

15:20.571 --> 15:22.269
I'm gonna put him down.

15:22.269 --> 15:24.619
Well, you can't
do that because...

15:24.619 --> 15:26.447
He is our familiar!

15:26.447 --> 15:28.840
- You need to let him go.
- Get your hands off of me!

15:32.061 --> 15:34.368
Guillermo? Guillermo?

15:34.368 --> 15:39.460
Guillermo! Guillermo!

15:41.549 --> 15:43.551
<i>Guillermo!</i>

15:43.551 --> 15:45.553
Guillermo, snap out of it.

15:45.553 --> 15:47.468
They think you are
a bastard vampire

15:47.468 --> 15:48.643
And they're going to kill you.

15:48.643 --> 15:49.774
- Guillermo?
-  Come on, girl.

15:49.774 --> 15:51.124
Get out!

15:51.124 --> 15:52.952
Guillermo.

15:52.952 --> 15:55.476
Guillermo? Hello?

15:55.476 --> 15:57.826
Sorry. [chuckles] Guillermo?

15:57.826 --> 15:59.959
Guillermo?

15:59.959 --> 16:02.048
Nadja, hi.

16:02.048 --> 16:03.701
What? You work here?

16:03.701 --> 16:05.486
Volunteer, actually.

16:05.486 --> 16:07.662
It's a way of giving back.

16:07.662 --> 16:09.969
I mean, who rescued who, right?

16:09.969 --> 16:12.449
- Have you seen Guillermo?
- Guillermo?

16:12.449 --> 16:14.495
Oh, no, no, not here.

16:14.495 --> 16:16.453
This place is just for strays.

16:16.453 --> 16:18.934
- I have a family.
- Hey! Eat your chicken!

16:18.934 --> 16:20.980
-  He's not
gonna make it.
- I can hear you.

16:20.980 --> 16:22.982
Guillermo! Open!

16:22.982 --> 16:24.940
Guillermo.

16:24.940 --> 16:27.334
Uh, I don't...
think I can make it.

16:27.334 --> 16:29.510
Of course you're gonna make it.
I know this is difficult,

16:29.510 --> 16:31.729
but you've got
to be strong, okay?

16:31.729 --> 16:35.472
I want you to go in here
and ask to use the toilet.

16:35.472 --> 16:38.301
Then I want you to ask
for a sanitary wipe.

16:38.301 --> 16:40.260
Then I want you to ask

16:40.260 --> 16:42.175
when the last time
they cleaned the toilet.

16:42.175 --> 16:43.480
Then I want you to tell them

16:43.480 --> 16:45.221
you're gonna take
a nice big shit, okay?

16:45.221 --> 16:47.354
It's gonna buy you
a few more hours of energy.

16:47.354 --> 16:50.313
- Whoa! Get the fuck out!
-  Oh, fuck.

16:50.313 --> 16:52.446
- May I use your toilet?
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.839
Yo!

16:54.839 --> 16:56.580
It's my guy from TikTok.

16:56.580 --> 16:58.626
What?

16:58.626 --> 17:00.671
Whoa!
Nobody fucking move.

17:03.500 --> 17:05.372
<i>♪ Jump around...♪</i>

17:05.372 --> 17:06.590
Colin Robinson, that's you.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.244
-  Oh,
for crying out loud.
- Yeah.

17:08.244 --> 17:10.246
How did they make this
so quick? And the music?

17:10.246 --> 17:11.769
Aah!

17:11.769 --> 17:13.336
Nice shot.

17:13.336 --> 17:16.165
Thank you so much!
You saved my store!

17:16.165 --> 17:18.254
- He did?
- How clean's your toi...

17:18.254 --> 17:20.517
- It's...
- No!

17:20.517 --> 17:22.302
Colin Robinson!

17:22.302 --> 17:24.304
- Guillermo!
- You can't be back here.

17:24.304 --> 17:26.349
Move!

17:26.349 --> 17:28.351
- Fuck off!

17:28.351 --> 17:30.527
- Guillermo!
- Hey, girl.

17:30.527 --> 17:32.790
Get off him!
Get away!

17:32.790 --> 17:34.966
- He's mine!

17:37.099 --> 17:39.841
Get off him! Get off!

17:39.841 --> 17:42.148
Shoo! Scram!

17:44.150 --> 17:45.934
Now, what the fuck, man?

17:45.934 --> 17:47.588
This doctor tells me
you're almost a vampire?

17:47.588 --> 17:49.894
Oops, I have a little secret.

17:49.894 --> 17:52.288
- Focus, Guillermo.
The truth now.

17:52.288 --> 17:54.769
Fine! Okay?

17:54.769 --> 17:58.077
I took my fate into my own
destiny and I had Derek do it.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.904
- I paid him to do it.
He turned me into a vampire!

17:59.904 --> 18:02.037
Derek?

18:02.037 --> 18:05.171
You could have been turned
by a legendary vampire,

18:05.171 --> 18:09.044
and you gave it away to Derek?

18:09.044 --> 18:12.221
Nandor is going to rip your face
into a new asshole.

18:12.221 --> 18:13.788
Well, it doesn't matter,
does, it, 'cause these guys

18:13.788 --> 18:15.355
- are gonna kill me anyways.
- Oh shut up, you dumb dick.

18:15.355 --> 18:17.922
I'm not gonna let them kill you.
That is Nandor's privilege.

18:17.922 --> 18:19.750
- Now, come on, let's go.

18:21.012 --> 18:22.884
I told you,
we need to put him down.

18:22.884 --> 18:24.277
That's not going to happen.

18:24.277 --> 18:25.974
He is coming with me,

18:25.974 --> 18:29.151
and his master
will decide how to kill him.

18:29.151 --> 18:31.893
If we release an abomination
like that onto the street,

18:31.893 --> 18:33.677
I'm gonna lose
my medical license.

18:35.810 --> 18:37.725
Nadja! Watch out.

18:43.644 --> 18:44.558
Help me, you load.

18:46.690 --> 18:48.301
- Oh, whoa.
-  Good one, Guillermo!

18:48.301 --> 18:49.650
- Ow.
- Yes!

18:49.650 --> 18:51.608
Nice one.

18:51.608 --> 18:53.132
- Ha!
- Watch out!

18:59.312 --> 19:00.356
Don't touch her!

19:01.923 --> 19:02.880
No!

19:04.969 --> 19:07.058
You're just a glorified vet.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.017
Guillermo!

19:09.017 --> 19:10.018
Nadja!

19:11.976 --> 19:14.240
Get away from her, you bitch!

19:14.240 --> 19:17.895
Oh!

19:17.895 --> 19:21.116
Thank you, Girerro.

19:21.116 --> 19:24.206
Oh. I think I might've got a
little bit of poison in my face.

19:24.206 --> 19:26.121
Do I look okay?

19:26.121 --> 19:29.342
- Yeah. You look-- you look fine.
- Good.

19:29.342 --> 19:30.995
Now go and find your clothes
and I'll...

19:32.693 --> 19:34.129
Let's go.

19:35.304 --> 19:38.655
Laszlo! Laszlo!

19:38.655 --> 19:40.222
- What is it, man?
- Help!

19:40.222 --> 19:42.137
Quick, to the laboratory.

19:44.748 --> 19:46.620
- Laszlo, hurry. Please hurry.
- All right.

19:46.620 --> 19:48.143
Now, brace yourself, fellas.

19:48.143 --> 19:49.275
Turning the machine

19:49.275 --> 19:51.190
- on.

19:54.584 --> 19:56.020
Is it working? Do you feel good?

19:57.631 --> 20:00.721
It hurt at first, but now
I kind of like it.

20:00.721 --> 20:01.896
- Yeah.

20:01.896 --> 20:04.594
What exactly is the
purpose of this machine?

20:04.594 --> 20:07.162
It's just a simple
energy transference device.

20:07.162 --> 20:10.165
I originally built it
to combat situational impotence,

20:10.165 --> 20:12.863
or whiskey dick,
as you might call it.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.953
Oh, that makes sense,
'cause I'm getting a little

20:15.953 --> 20:18.042
tickle in my pickle.

20:18.042 --> 20:19.740
Well, that's an accident,
'cause I removed that aspect.

20:19.740 --> 20:21.611
- Must be the vibrations.
- Could be.

20:21.611 --> 20:23.918
Or could be the smell.

20:23.918 --> 20:25.659
I really like
the smell of burning hair.

20:25.659 --> 20:26.747
What about you, Nandor?

20:26.747 --> 20:28.618
How are you finding it?

20:28.618 --> 20:30.098
Oh, fuck.

20:33.362 --> 20:34.624
-  Shit.

20:34.624 --> 20:36.539
Turning the machine off.

20:37.540 --> 20:39.194
Reverse the process, Laszlo.

20:39.194 --> 20:40.587
Well, I can't.
It's too late, isn't it?

20:40.587 --> 20:42.458
- Look at him. Shit.
-  [in distance] Laszlo!

20:42.458 --> 20:44.199
- Get fucking downstairs!
- Shit.

20:44.199 --> 20:46.723
Go ahead.
I'll reenergize Nandor myself.

20:46.723 --> 20:48.116
- How?
-  Laszlo!
- Well, if I can drain

20:48.116 --> 20:49.248
the energy from people,

20:49.248 --> 20:50.466
I sure as hell
can put it back in them.

20:50.466 --> 20:52.076
- Just go. Trust me.
-  Get downstairs!

20:52.076 --> 20:53.817
- Coming, my darling.
-  Don't you "darling" me.

20:53.817 --> 20:55.732
Would I be wrong
in sensing some...

20:58.126 --> 21:00.781
It's your boy, Colin Robinson.

21:00.781 --> 21:05.351
But I'm going to tell you
my real name. It's...

21:05.351 --> 21:07.527
Arthur...

21:07.527 --> 21:09.180
Simon...

21:09.180 --> 21:10.443
Santino.

21:10.443 --> 21:13.228
But I-I had to change it

21:13.228 --> 21:15.622
because people would laugh
when they realized

21:15.622 --> 21:19.103
that the initials
spelled out "ass."

21:20.366 --> 21:22.237
Ass.

21:22.237 --> 21:24.370
Do you know who it was
that pointed that out to me?

21:24.370 --> 21:25.371
No.

21:25.371 --> 21:27.677
It was my ex-boyfriend,

21:27.677 --> 21:29.331
- Davy Crockett.

21:29.331 --> 21:30.724
At the Alamo.

21:31.768 --> 21:33.509
- Really?
- Yeah.

21:33.509 --> 21:35.685
If-if you don't believe me,

21:35.685 --> 21:39.428
maybe this knife that Jim Bowie
gave me will convince you.

21:39.428 --> 21:40.821
Ass.

21:43.650 --> 21:46.087
-  My darling,
you need to calm down.
- I mean, what the hell?

21:46.087 --> 21:48.263
- We have a little two-faced
bitch, lying-behind-the-back

21:48.263 --> 21:50.221
vampire in the house
and my husband doesn't think

21:50.221 --> 21:51.484
- I need to know about it?
- Cool it,

21:51.484 --> 21:53.355
my darling.
I'm just trying to find a cure.

21:53.355 --> 21:54.400
All right? Now,

21:54.400 --> 21:55.749
if I can stop
the transformation,

21:55.749 --> 21:58.186
maybe Nandor can turn Gizmo.

21:58.186 --> 22:01.450
- You are a worthless piece
of big, wet <i>skatá,</i> Guillermo.
- Yeah.

22:01.450 --> 22:03.365
When Nandor finds out,
he's going to kill you.

22:03.365 --> 22:04.584
And then he's going
to kill all of us.

22:04.584 --> 22:05.672
- Mm.
- And then he's going
to kill himself.

22:05.672 --> 22:06.716
- Then don't tell him.
- I'm not going

22:06.716 --> 22:08.065
to lie to my housemate
to cover up

22:08.065 --> 22:09.545
- your treachery.
-  Just give me

22:09.545 --> 22:11.025
a chance to make this up.
When I did this, I didn't--

22:11.025 --> 22:13.027
Finally. Well, well, well.

22:13.027 --> 22:14.507
You've been gone all night.

22:14.507 --> 22:15.421
What, you can't even call?

22:15.421 --> 22:17.031
Sorry.

22:17.031 --> 22:18.293
They tried to put me down.

22:18.293 --> 22:19.555
What? Why?

22:19.555 --> 22:21.035
What did the doctor say?

22:21.035 --> 22:22.428
Uh, uh, uh...

22:23.603 --> 22:24.734
Yes?

22:26.214 --> 22:27.607
Guillermo is fine.

22:27.607 --> 22:29.522
Just your average weak-boned,

22:29.522 --> 22:31.393
- broken-foot familiar.

22:31.393 --> 22:34.265
I guess someone won't be
cutting a rug anytime soon.

22:34.265 --> 22:35.310
Wait.

22:36.659 --> 22:38.269
Don't move.

22:45.451 --> 22:46.582
What...

22:46.582 --> 22:48.541
the hell...

22:48.541 --> 22:50.369
is this?

22:53.415 --> 22:54.285
Hmm?

22:55.504 --> 22:57.114
Frog?

22:57.114 --> 22:58.681
Really? A frog?

22:58.681 --> 23:01.380
A frog that flies and has hair

23:01.380 --> 23:03.643
and looks kind of like you?

23:05.209 --> 23:07.298
Guillermo, do you think
I am an idiot?

23:07.298 --> 23:08.735
Say no.

23:08.735 --> 23:09.779
No.

23:09.779 --> 23:10.998
That's right.

23:10.998 --> 23:12.521
Because this is

23:12.521 --> 23:14.436
precisely what happens

23:14.436 --> 23:17.265
when a little birdy
sneaks into this house,

23:17.265 --> 23:19.659
fucks a mouse,
they have a child that grows up

23:19.659 --> 23:22.444
that then fucks a frog
that looks like you.

23:22.444 --> 23:25.708
This is a direct result
of your slacking.

23:25.708 --> 23:28.624
We are not running
a fucking circus here.

23:28.624 --> 23:30.104
- Yeesh.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.237
Give him to me.

23:33.237 --> 23:34.587
You may have fooled him,

23:34.587 --> 23:37.807
'cause he has the IQ
of a Russian toilet,

23:37.807 --> 23:39.809
but I know you're up
to something, aren't you,

23:39.809 --> 23:41.376
you little sneaky Pete?

23:45.424 --> 23:46.816
Okay, Colin,

23:46.816 --> 23:48.470
- if I tell you something--
-  Psych.

23:48.470 --> 23:49.863
I couldn't give two squirts.
