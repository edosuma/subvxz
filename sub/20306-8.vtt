NARRATOR:
<i>Previously on </i>Hill Street Blues...

00:03.837 --> 00:07.215
Detective Belker hops
tonight's redeye to Las Vegas.

00:07.298 --> 00:10.010
Flying is about the safest form
of transportation around today.

00:10.093 --> 00:11.553
Look, ma'am, if the boy stole something,

00:11.636 --> 00:13.596
we usually just take him home
and tell his parents.

00:16.182 --> 00:19.102
-That's her.
-Are you sure?

00:19.185 --> 00:20.854
-(crying) That's her. Close it.
-Okay.

00:20.937 --> 00:22.188
FABIAN: Tell me something.

00:22.272 --> 00:24.149
Who I'm gonna cook for now?

00:24.232 --> 00:27.527
I got this judge to sign some papers
to make me your legal guardian.

00:27.610 --> 00:30.030
Mick, I just got this message
you're going to Las Vegas tonight.

00:30.113 --> 00:31.031
Yep.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.907
I got to tell you,
I'm not that crazy about it.

00:32.991 --> 00:34.325
Now, these are junket tickets,

00:34.409 --> 00:36.244
which means
there's a couple of restrictions on 'em.

00:36.327 --> 00:37.871
<i>Eau de P.U.</i>

00:38.288 --> 00:39.622
That's her favorite cologne.

00:39.706 --> 00:42.459
Would you put that back?
It's Leo's letter to his ex.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.543
-Oof.
-J.D.: Mick.

00:44.419 --> 00:46.087
(imitates droning sound)

00:48.173 --> 00:49.215
-(chattering)
-STAN: Item six.

00:49.299 --> 00:51.760
Yesterday I looked into my crystal ball.

00:51.843 --> 00:55.722
I told you that the Corrections drivers
were not going out on strike.

00:55.805 --> 00:58.516
That's why I'm a cop
and not a fortuneteller.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.018
They're out on a wildcat.

01:00.101 --> 01:02.479
You're gonna be driving prisoners
to the court

01:02.562 --> 01:05.356
and to the tombs
until they get back on the job.

01:05.440 --> 01:06.691
(all moaning)

01:06.775 --> 01:08.318
For time and a half, Sarge?

01:08.401 --> 01:09.360
Time.

01:10.236 --> 01:11.905
-Item seven.
-(clipboard thuds)

01:12.697 --> 01:14.324
Memo from Division.

01:16.326 --> 01:19.370
(chuckles) "It's been brought
to this department's attention

01:19.454 --> 01:20.413
"by general accounting

01:20.497 --> 01:24.542
"that certain officers have been
submitting insurance claims

01:24.626 --> 01:28.922
"for therapy treatments
at the Paradise Lost Health Clinic

01:29.005 --> 01:31.132
"on Simón Bolívar Avenue.

01:32.092 --> 01:36.471
"Said establishment was raided yesterday
by Washington Heights vice

01:36.554 --> 01:40.308
and is henceforth off-limits
to all personnel."

01:40.391 --> 01:41.267
Guys...

01:42.644 --> 01:45.063
you wanna go to a whorehouse,
that's up to you.

01:45.522 --> 01:48.233
Don't try to pass it off as major medical.

01:48.316 --> 01:50.527
"Job-related stress."

01:50.610 --> 01:52.946
-Malarkey.
-(all laugh)

01:53.029 --> 01:54.572
Uh, item eight.

01:55.115 --> 01:59.410
"Ceremonies today,
reopening of the Monarch Theater."

01:59.494 --> 02:03.164
That's phase two of the Monarch Block
Rehabilitation Project.

02:03.248 --> 02:04.290
The mayor's gonna be there,

02:04.374 --> 02:07.335
so we're gonna have to coordinate
security with Division.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.587
Breem, Cantrovich, Schnebble, Mayo,

02:09.671 --> 02:12.423
Garibaldi, and Sergeant Bates
draw the plum.

02:12.590 --> 02:13.675
Item nine.

02:14.509 --> 02:16.136
-Flu season, people.
-J.D: Yeah.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.971
-Ooh. Vegas.
-Seems we got a bug going around.

02:18.054 --> 02:21.641
The sick are LaRue, Washington, Coffey,

02:21.724 --> 02:23.852
Lieutenants Calletano and Hunter.

02:23.935 --> 02:28.022
Now, now yours truly doesn't believe
there is any mystery

02:28.106 --> 02:29.983
to personal healthcare, people.

02:30.441 --> 02:33.778
Um, you take a couple of extra minutes
when you go out

02:33.862 --> 02:36.156
to make sure that you're dressed warm.

02:36.447 --> 02:39.159
You, uh, make sure
that we're eating right.

02:39.242 --> 02:43.037
That includes our breakfast,
which, of course, springboards our day.

02:43.121 --> 02:46.624
And then, of course, we wear
our garlic cloves around our neck

02:46.708 --> 02:51.254
until four days of sunshine in the spring
or April the 7th, whichever comes first.

02:51.337 --> 02:54.340
That's it. Let's have a safe shift.

02:54.674 --> 02:57.427
Let's do it to them
before they do it to us.

02:57.510 --> 03:00.847
-(chattering)
-(chairs scraping)

03:02.432 --> 03:04.726
I'm taking an hour
of personal time this morning.

03:04.809 --> 03:06.269
I got to enroll Fabian in school.

03:06.352 --> 03:08.813
Oh, it's a lousy morning for it, Sergeant.

03:08.897 --> 03:11.316
Yeah, I know,
but it's his first day of class, you know,

03:11.399 --> 03:13.484
and I got to talk to his teacher.

03:13.568 --> 03:14.903
Uh, as quick as you can.

03:14.986 --> 03:17.280
-I need all the people I can get.
-Right.

03:17.363 --> 03:19.157
Got any plans for Thanksgiving, Leo?

03:19.240 --> 03:21.451
Yeah, me and the football game.

03:21.534 --> 03:24.329
Well, I'm cooking up a turkey.
That is if you're interested.

03:24.412 --> 03:26.706
That'd be fun. Do you got a TV?

03:26.789 --> 03:30.001
Sarge! Messages for you, Sarge.

03:30.251 --> 03:31.085
Oh.

03:32.378 --> 03:34.923
"Vera Horvath. Vera Horvath.
Vera Horvath."

03:35.006 --> 03:37.759
Sarge, this came for you. I signed for it.

03:37.842 --> 03:39.052
Huh.

03:45.934 --> 03:49.938
(chattering)

03:50.021 --> 03:53.024
-(bells ringing)
-(coins jingling)

03:53.107 --> 03:56.611
(chattering)

04:01.783 --> 04:03.660
MAN 1: Yo! Whoo-hoo!

04:03.743 --> 04:07.455
MAN 2: Insurance, anyone?
Do you speak Spanish?

04:07.956 --> 04:10.625
(chattering continues)

04:12.168 --> 04:14.754
Excuse me. I'm looking
for Isadore Fagenbaum.

04:14.837 --> 04:16.506
I think he runs the steam bath.

04:16.589 --> 04:18.258
Yes, the spa's in the back, sir.

04:18.508 --> 04:21.052
Would you like a free chance
at our $5,000 slot?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.888
No, thank you.
I'm just looking for this man.

04:23.972 --> 04:26.057
Well, you still get
a free pull if you want it.

04:26.975 --> 04:27.892
Okay.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.562
Thank you.

04:32.647 --> 04:35.566
-(bells ringing)
-(alarm blaring)

04:35.650 --> 04:38.236
(coins jingling)

04:41.656 --> 04:44.200
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

04:44.450 --> 04:46.244
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

04:46.327 --> 04:50.039
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

04:50.123 --> 04:51.833
(sirens wailing)

04:57.297 --> 04:59.924
(theme music playing)

06:20.630 --> 06:23.383
Lucy, I went through Frank Jr.'s
closet last night,

06:23.466 --> 06:25.593
and I found some things
I think will fit Fabian.

06:25.676 --> 06:27.428
Hey, that's great. Thanks a lot.

06:28.262 --> 06:29.263
How's he doing?

06:29.806 --> 06:32.100
So far, so good. I enrolled him
in school this morning, so...

06:32.183 --> 06:33.476
Yeah? How are you doing?

06:34.227 --> 06:35.436
Well, I was up all last night,

06:35.520 --> 06:37.605
wondering how am I gonna
take on a kid like this.

06:37.688 --> 06:39.065
I mean, what am I, crazy?

06:39.148 --> 06:41.359
Did I get the right stuff for breakfast?
You know.

06:41.943 --> 06:43.569
Instant motherhood, right?

06:43.653 --> 06:45.405
Yeah, but it gets easier, I mean...

06:45.863 --> 06:48.658
-Tell me it gets easier.
-Harder.

06:48.741 --> 06:50.493
But, I mean, it calms down.
It all settles down.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.287
You, you get a night's sleep.
I mean, it's worth it.

06:54.372 --> 06:55.289
Well...

06:56.541 --> 06:58.543
Ha-ha. Thank you very much.

06:58.626 --> 06:59.669
-(chuckles)
-Great.

06:59.752 --> 07:00.878
Welcome to the club.

07:01.295 --> 07:02.171
Uh-huh.

07:05.758 --> 07:08.094
Captain, uh, Mr. Lowe
from the Monarch Project.

07:08.177 --> 07:09.011
Thank you.

07:10.138 --> 07:13.141
Biff Lowe. I'm so glad we finally met up.

07:13.224 --> 07:14.642
How can I help you, Mr. Lowe?

07:14.725 --> 07:17.979
Well, first of all, Captain,
I want to thank you

07:18.062 --> 07:21.107
for the marvelous preparations
for all our events.

07:21.190 --> 07:24.026
-Friday night is going to be fabulous.
-Thank you.

07:24.110 --> 07:28.156
Now if you could just spare us
two more officers,

07:28.406 --> 07:31.492
I tell you, uh,
it would be worth my right arm.

07:31.576 --> 07:35.163
-When?
-Well, uh, the long weekend really.

07:35.496 --> 07:38.624
We're rented a fabulously
expensive sound system.

07:38.958 --> 07:43.212
Now, believe me, I'm the first to say it.
And I'll say it fresh, I'll say it hot.

07:43.296 --> 07:46.883
Ninety-nine percent of your people
up here are law-abiding citizens.

07:46.966 --> 07:49.552
Uh, I'm afraid that, uh,
we don't have enough manpower

07:49.635 --> 07:51.429
to stand 24-hour guard

07:51.596 --> 07:54.015
over Monarch Redevelopment's
stereo system.

07:54.098 --> 07:58.144
Captain, we're talking about
the cultural heritage of your community.

07:58.978 --> 08:02.190
Now, do you suppose
if I put in a call to Fletcher...

08:02.273 --> 08:04.817
You already did,
and he told you what I'm telling you.

08:04.901 --> 08:06.777
You seem to think that police protection

08:06.861 --> 08:08.863
flows like water out of a tap
up here on the Hill.

08:08.946 --> 08:09.822
That's just not so.

08:11.365 --> 08:14.619
Don't you see the history
the Monarch represents?

08:14.785 --> 08:17.288
The chance for revitalization?

08:17.371 --> 08:19.040
You see revitalization.

08:19.373 --> 08:21.167
I see 200 limousines

08:21.250 --> 08:24.003
dumping about 800 rich people
onto my streets tomorrow night

08:24.086 --> 08:26.380
and flaunting it over people
who can hardly pay the rent.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.424
I must say, Captain, I...

08:29.008 --> 08:31.219
I'm afraid you're taking the short view.

08:31.302 --> 08:33.596
I'm in a short-view job, Mr. Lowe.

08:35.014 --> 08:35.973
Yes.

08:38.392 --> 08:42.063
Well, I certainly hope we'll be seeing you
at the dedication ceremonies, Captain.

08:42.355 --> 08:44.440
(door opens)

08:44.524 --> 08:47.235
(chattering)

08:51.656 --> 08:54.492
MAN: Looking for a three.
Looking for a three.

08:57.245 --> 08:58.829
-Rolled a nine.
-Damn.

08:58.913 --> 09:00.039
You warm 'em up, Joseph.

09:00.122 --> 09:03.334
J.D.'s gonna shake, rattle,
and roll this joint into Chapter 11.

09:03.417 --> 09:04.794
Make 'em apologize, Joseph.

09:04.877 --> 09:06.921
Yeah, they got a lot of apologizing to do.

09:07.004 --> 09:08.631
I think I'll try keno.

09:09.549 --> 09:10.591
MAN: Still looking for a three.

09:10.675 --> 09:13.010
I'm with you, Lieutenant.
Let's ease into this.

09:14.387 --> 09:15.346
All right.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.557
MAN: Nope.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.767
(chattering)

09:19.850 --> 09:21.769
-Any luck, gentlemen?
-RAY: Hey, nothing, Lieutenant.

09:21.852 --> 09:23.020
We're just looking, Howard, just looking.

09:23.104 --> 09:25.773
As am I, Raymundo, for Leo's ex.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.531
An extraordinary number of Asiatics.

09:38.411 --> 09:39.453
Myrna!

09:41.956 --> 09:43.249
Myrna Schnitz.

09:43.541 --> 09:45.293
-Lieutenant Hunter?
-Right.

09:45.793 --> 09:47.169
How are you, my good woman?

09:47.253 --> 09:48.546
Great. Okay.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.673
-How's yourself?
-Oh, never better.

09:51.632 --> 09:53.634
I bring you greetings from the east.

09:54.218 --> 09:55.803
That's got to be from Leo.

09:55.886 --> 09:58.264
He's the only guy
that keeps that cologne in business.

09:59.974 --> 10:02.101
-How is he?
-Oh, he's like a new man.

10:02.184 --> 10:03.978
He's lost weight.
He looks ten years younger.

10:04.061 --> 10:06.439
You're kidding. So he seems happy?

10:06.856 --> 10:08.149
Old home week, Myrna?

10:08.232 --> 10:09.734
A friend of mine from back east.

10:10.109 --> 10:11.360
Does he play blackjack?

10:12.153 --> 10:14.071
Well, I'll hazard a wager.
What are the stakes?

10:14.447 --> 10:15.906
$25 minimum.

10:15.990 --> 10:18.284
-Hi, Myrna!
-J.D.!

10:18.367 --> 10:20.369
Joe, what is this, a convention?

10:20.453 --> 10:21.954
Hey, how about dealing us
some seconds, huh?

10:22.038 --> 10:23.914
Don't even say that in fun.

10:24.373 --> 10:26.417
So how's it going? Having any luck?

10:26.500 --> 10:28.461
Yeah, all of it's been bad, too.

10:28.544 --> 10:30.421
-Mick!
-Hello, Mrs. Schnitz.

10:30.504 --> 10:31.964
-You get your letter?
-Yeah.

10:32.048 --> 10:35.176
Listen, fellas, here's some keys.

10:35.259 --> 10:38.095
-Suites at the DI.
-J.D.: What's going on?

10:38.179 --> 10:41.432
I go to see my friend. I pull the thing.

10:41.515 --> 10:43.059
Bada-bing, bada-boom, bada-ba,

10:43.142 --> 10:45.394
with the noise, with the flashes,
with the lights.

10:45.603 --> 10:46.854
$5,000.

10:46.937 --> 10:48.189
You pulled what thing?

10:48.272 --> 10:49.774
The thing, the thing at the entrance.

10:49.857 --> 10:52.193
-That big slot? The free slot?
-Yeah, that one.

10:52.276 --> 10:54.987
And I won this, and I won the rooms.

10:55.237 --> 10:56.947
And, and so I fibbed a little bit.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.076
I told them I was staying over,
I was with a big party.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.495
-Good of you to think of us, Mick.
-It's unbelievable.

11:02.578 --> 11:05.831
And my friend wasn't even there.
I had to leave him a note.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.459
J.D., what time...

11:08.668 --> 11:11.295
Oh, boy! I got to pick my prisoner up.

11:11.462 --> 11:13.547
Mick, hey, put that away.

11:14.382 --> 11:15.341
Oh, yeah.

11:16.967 --> 11:18.552
-I'll see you at home, Mick. Thanks.
-Yeah.

11:18.636 --> 11:21.097
Hey, Mick, Mick, uh, look.

11:21.180 --> 11:22.014
Since you're flush,

11:22.098 --> 11:24.433
do you think you can let me hold
a couple of hundred?

11:25.017 --> 11:26.227
Yeah, sure.

11:28.562 --> 11:31.023
I'll pay you back as soon
as we get home, all right?

11:31.107 --> 11:32.525
Huh. Yeah.

11:32.608 --> 11:34.235
-Hey, thank you.
-Yeah.

11:35.945 --> 11:38.239
-(police sirens wailing)
-MAN: Here, police! Police!

11:38.447 --> 11:40.991
Robbery! Please! It is robbery!

11:41.075 --> 11:43.411
-Please, they take my ticket!
-RENKO: Sir, calm down!

11:43.494 --> 11:45.496
Robbery! It is robbery!

11:45.579 --> 11:47.748
I am telling you my ticket is gone!

11:47.832 --> 11:50.751
The chance of a lifetime
was taken from me!

11:50.835 --> 11:53.754
It is (indistinct). I'm telling
you my ticket is gone!

11:53.838 --> 11:56.382
And I am telling you
I will get you another ticket!

11:56.465 --> 11:57.675
Lottery? Calm down about it.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.428
$3,000, and I am leaving
to collect my prize!

12:00.511 --> 12:03.639
I am outside, and right here (indistinct).

12:03.723 --> 12:07.852
And this ticket, chance of a lifetime
in America is taken from me!

12:07.935 --> 12:08.894
Which way did they go?

12:08.978 --> 12:09.937
-That way.
-That way.

12:10.730 --> 12:15.109
One moment I am winning,
and I am hero of my family, $3,000.

12:15.192 --> 12:16.527
You must help us.

12:16.610 --> 12:18.070
They are... with their fists!

12:18.154 --> 12:21.115
And I am fighting, but--
Right here! And it is no good!

12:21.198 --> 12:23.868
But you said he went that way.
The other guy said this way.

12:23.951 --> 12:26.203
-I am goat.
-No, sir, you are not a goat.

12:26.287 --> 12:28.873
-I am goat!
-Sir, you're not a goat.

12:28.956 --> 12:31.792
-He's a citizen, isn't he?
-(clamoring)

12:31.876 --> 12:33.753
You all want to go down
to the station or not?

12:33.836 --> 12:35.379
-I can't believe it!
-Yes, please!

12:36.005 --> 12:38.299
I can't believe it! I can't believe it!

12:38.382 --> 12:40.342
I just... I can't believe it.

12:42.136 --> 12:43.554
He can't believe it.

12:43.637 --> 12:45.681
LOWE: We look forward to the day

12:45.765 --> 12:50.728
when this whole square block will be alive
with shops and restaurants.

12:51.645 --> 12:55.900
And, so, on behalf
of the nonprofit friends of the Monarch,

12:55.983 --> 13:00.529
as well as our dedicated associates,
Anthony and Phillip Barletta,

13:00.863 --> 13:05.201
I say to you at the risk
of being taken for a royalist...

13:05.576 --> 13:06.869
(laughs)

13:07.495 --> 13:09.079
...long live the Monarch.

13:09.538 --> 13:10.998
(applause)

13:11.081 --> 13:12.625
LOWE: Thank you very much.

13:12.708 --> 13:15.461
Phil Barletta, would you
care to say anything, please?

13:15.544 --> 13:16.670
Please.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.632
(camera shutters click)

13:20.299 --> 13:22.551
I don't have any remarks prepared.

13:22.718 --> 13:25.888
I just want to say
glad everyone could be here.

13:25.971 --> 13:28.641
Uh, enjoy the buffet
on the Barletta brothers.

13:28.724 --> 13:32.311
(applauding)

13:32.394 --> 13:34.230
Uh, Mr. Mayor. Mr. Mayor?

13:34.772 --> 13:39.026
(applauding)

13:41.946 --> 13:43.364
I grew up on Dekker.

13:43.531 --> 13:46.784
I came to this theater with my sisters
when I was a boy.

13:48.077 --> 13:50.454
Please don't feel I'm misusing
this glorious occasion

13:50.538 --> 13:52.957
if I dissent from Mr. Lowe on one point.

13:53.582 --> 13:55.543
Welcome back to the Monarch.

13:56.961 --> 13:59.255
But let's not rush into phase three
of the project

13:59.338 --> 14:01.423
without asking some important questions.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.885
I, for one, don't want
the kind of urban renewal

14:04.969 --> 14:08.806
that expels an impoverished community
rather than lets it in.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.184
(applauding)

14:14.562 --> 14:15.855
Uh, uh...

14:15.938 --> 14:18.524
Oh, everyone, now please,
uh, please enjoy the buffet.

14:18.607 --> 14:21.151
(applauding)

14:21.694 --> 14:23.445
MAN: Over here, Mr. Mayor! Mr. Mayor?

14:23.529 --> 14:25.865
-WOMAN: A few questions, please!
-MAN: Mr. Mayor?

14:25.948 --> 14:26.991
Mr. Mayor, are you satisfied

14:27.074 --> 14:29.326
with Monarch Redevelopment's record
on minority hiring?

14:29.410 --> 14:30.244
Yes, I am.

14:30.327 --> 14:31.912
What about your little dig
on gentrification?

14:31.996 --> 14:34.999
We're still in negotiations.
Uh, no further comment.

14:35.082 --> 14:37.710
-(reporters clamoring)
-WOMAN: Mayor Cleveland!

14:37.793 --> 14:39.169
-(gunfire)
-(woman screaming)

14:39.253 --> 14:43.173
(clamoring)

14:46.677 --> 14:47.970
Harry!

14:48.679 --> 14:50.723
-Police!
-The guy just went around the corner!

14:55.603 --> 14:57.438
-Stop! Police!
-Hold it!

14:58.981 --> 15:02.735
-(police sirens wailing)
-(tires screeching)

15:06.155 --> 15:07.156
PATSY: Oh!

15:09.742 --> 15:10.701
Ugh!

15:12.745 --> 15:15.247
(grunts)

15:18.834 --> 15:20.920
(breathing heavily)

15:21.003 --> 15:22.087
LUCY: I got the gun!

15:27.009 --> 15:29.845
I want a complete press blackout.
Not a word to any of these guys.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.014
-What's the mayor's condition?
-He's okay. He's okay.

15:32.097 --> 15:34.308
They're treating his shoulder
at emergency.

15:34.391 --> 15:36.810
Frank Magnuson.
I'll see my client Mr. Springer now.

15:36.894 --> 15:40.064
HARRY: Just wait one second, all right?
Wait till we book him, sir.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.691
-Who dropped the fast dime to him?
-(groans)

15:43.984 --> 15:45.069
Springer's in.

15:45.152 --> 15:46.779
Any indication he'd like to talk?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.197
He's already got a lawyer.

15:48.530 --> 15:50.866
Captain, can I talk to you
about something else for a second?

15:50.950 --> 15:52.034
Sure. Come on in.

15:54.328 --> 15:56.872
-You're not gonna believe this.
-(papers rustling)

15:56.956 --> 15:59.249
Look what came for me this a.m.

15:59.333 --> 16:00.501
Express delivery.

16:03.170 --> 16:04.004
Oh!

16:04.797 --> 16:05.714
FRANK: Who is this?

16:06.548 --> 16:07.424
Vera Horvath.

16:08.258 --> 16:09.885
Lieutenant Horvath of Polk Avenue?

16:11.971 --> 16:15.057
Woman's been sending me letters,
breathing at me on the phone.

16:15.849 --> 16:18.727
She's been on psychiatric leave.
She thinks she's in love with me.

16:19.561 --> 16:21.689
I didn't do anything
to encourage this, Captain.

16:21.772 --> 16:22.606
(paper rustling)

16:22.690 --> 16:24.775
I don't go near the woman.
I don't speak to her.

16:24.858 --> 16:26.485
That's a pretty bizarre outfit.

16:26.819 --> 16:28.404
-You're telling me.
-(rustles)

16:28.487 --> 16:31.281
I opened the envelope, I jumped ten feet.
I thought it was a tarantula.

16:32.449 --> 16:34.660
Those last couple
she's not wearing anything at all.

16:38.497 --> 16:39.748
How can I help?

16:40.541 --> 16:41.959
I need to know

16:42.042 --> 16:44.586
are they planning on reinstating
this woman, or what?

16:44.670 --> 16:46.630
I don't know. What do they say
down at Polk Avenue?

16:46.714 --> 16:48.424
Well, it's a medical matter.
It's confidential.

16:48.507 --> 16:50.217
I can't get any kind of a read over there.

16:50.300 --> 16:51.343
Well, maybe if I call.

16:51.427 --> 16:52.678
That's what I was gonna ask.

16:55.848 --> 16:58.392
What kind of a creep snaps
pictures like that, Captain?

16:58.475 --> 17:00.686
-Let me ask you that.
-Takes all kinds, Stan.

17:04.273 --> 17:07.317
I figure maybe she ran a string
from the shutter to her toe.

17:08.444 --> 17:10.946
(door opens, closes)

17:11.030 --> 17:14.658
Miss Davenport, we got a situation.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.952
The guy had a lawyer and wants a PD now.

17:17.703 --> 17:19.663
-Indigent?
-I don't know.

17:19.955 --> 17:22.458
(in low voice)
It's the guy who tried to shoot the mayor.

17:25.836 --> 17:29.339
Oh, this guy Magnuson
was being totally superficial,

17:29.423 --> 17:31.800
like he didn't have my best interests.

17:31.884 --> 17:33.802
So you want my office to represent you?

17:33.886 --> 17:37.347
And no car comes. Believe that?
I'm standing there, no car.

17:37.681 --> 17:39.683
Gee, that's a shame
when you try to assassinate a mayor

17:39.767 --> 17:40.601
and it doesn't come out right.

17:40.684 --> 17:42.352
Hey, be sarcastic.

17:42.436 --> 17:44.438
-Can you afford counsel?
-No.

17:45.230 --> 17:48.108
-Then who sent him?
-Therein lies the tale, honey.

17:48.734 --> 17:50.194
And you got to hear it. You understand me?

17:50.277 --> 17:53.030
'Cause if anything happens,
you go loud and clear to the cops.

17:53.113 --> 17:54.823
You got my instruction on that?

17:57.951 --> 18:00.370
Captain, preliminary ballistics
on Terry Springer's gun

18:00.454 --> 18:01.997
matches the attack bullets.

18:02.331 --> 18:04.124
-Good work, Lucy.
-Thanks.

18:04.208 --> 18:05.876
Still kind of like this, you know?

18:08.378 --> 18:10.714
Frank, my client feels he's at risk

18:10.798 --> 18:13.092
and requests added protection
when he's taken downtown.

18:13.175 --> 18:14.593
Does he also want to talk?

18:14.676 --> 18:16.428
Is that a condition for protecting him?

18:16.929 --> 18:20.432
No, there's strike over at Corrections,
so we're pulling in supervisors to drive.

18:20.516 --> 18:22.684
-There'll be a convoy.
-Hmm.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.853
There's also a possibility
Mr. Springer may want to

18:24.937 --> 18:27.106
negotiate after indictment,
if there is one.

18:27.189 --> 18:28.357
You talking conspiracy?

18:28.440 --> 18:29.942
After indictment, Lieutenant.

18:33.028 --> 18:36.281
(engines whirring)

18:36.365 --> 18:38.075
Hey, Detective, look, I'm a realist.

18:38.158 --> 18:40.494
I know that you would be
prejudiced not to believe me.

18:40.577 --> 18:41.745
MICK: Shut up.

18:42.871 --> 18:43.831
-MICK: Hello.
-Hello.

18:43.914 --> 18:47.251
We have reservations on flight 27,
Belker and Flaherty.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.629
I'm sorry, Mr. Belker,
but I'm afraid that flight's been delayed.

18:50.712 --> 18:53.006
-For how long?
-We have to bring in new equipment.

18:53.090 --> 18:54.424
New departure's at 4:00 p.m.

18:54.508 --> 18:56.885
That's five hours.
You don't have any other flights?

18:56.969 --> 18:58.262
No, I'm afraid not.

18:59.388 --> 19:01.849
Ah! I believe this is fate.

19:01.932 --> 19:04.726
I believe someone wants
an innocent man's story getting heard.

19:04.810 --> 19:06.812
Shut up. Arm.

19:07.146 --> 19:09.898
-Where are we going?
-The flight's not for five hours.

19:09.982 --> 19:11.859
We are going to see a friend of mine.

19:12.359 --> 19:13.777
MAN (on PA):<i> ...boarding at gate 2.</i>

19:13.861 --> 19:15.821
You know, you got good qualities,
Detective.

19:15.904 --> 19:17.447
I think we're gonna wind up
liking each other.

19:17.531 --> 19:19.158
Not in this lifetime.

19:19.992 --> 19:22.119
Hey, why don't you leave me,
go visit your friend,

19:22.202 --> 19:24.329
-and meet me back here?
-Shut up.

19:26.331 --> 19:28.125
Aw!

19:28.333 --> 19:31.670
Now I'm in a time capsule here.
I'm in a time warp.

19:31.753 --> 19:33.505
Mick Belker, Mr. Fagenbaum.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.132
Sure, introduce yourself.

19:35.215 --> 19:38.010
Like I wouldn't pick you out
of a crowd of 4,000 people, huh?

19:38.093 --> 19:40.846
(laughter)

19:40.929 --> 19:43.974
Oh, I could not come to Las Vegas
without looking you up.

19:44.057 --> 19:46.894
Sure, don't look me up.
Just leave me notes, huh?

19:46.977 --> 19:49.271
I'll have you shot.
Have you been on the streets?

19:49.688 --> 19:52.691
-Look at you. You're a cop now, huh?
-Yeah.

19:52.774 --> 19:54.735
-Hey, it's kind of warm in here.
-Shut up.

19:54.818 --> 19:56.028
Oh, there's a deep thinker.

19:57.237 --> 20:01.325
You remember that Schwitz
that your daddy used to bring you to, huh?

20:01.408 --> 20:03.452
-With your little (indistinct).
-(laughing)

20:03.535 --> 20:06.205
Ooh, why don't you change
and have a steam, huh?

20:06.288 --> 20:08.957
That'd probably be a little
complicated, Mr. Fagenbaum.

20:09.041 --> 20:10.167
Aah.

20:10.250 --> 20:11.752
MAN: I'm gonna tell you something
you won't believe.

20:11.835 --> 20:14.671
-Shut up.
-Absolutely no history--

20:14.755 --> 20:16.215
Absolutely no history of what?

20:16.298 --> 20:17.966
-Uh-oh.
-Uh-oh, what?

20:18.050 --> 20:20.636
-Uh-oh, ticker?
-(breathing heavily)

20:20.719 --> 20:22.221
Absolutely no history--

20:22.304 --> 20:24.223
-Joey, number five!
-Yes, sir!

20:24.306 --> 20:26.350
-(groaning)
-Here.

20:26.433 --> 20:28.185
Leave it-- Leave it to (indistinct).

20:28.268 --> 20:29.937
-Shut up.
-Stop telling me to shut up.

20:30.020 --> 20:32.064
I meant shut up "calm down."

20:33.190 --> 20:35.567
(breathing heavily) Whoo!

20:35.901 --> 20:37.319
Is it warm in here?

20:38.695 --> 20:40.489
Oh, no!

20:40.572 --> 20:42.407
-Uh-oh.
-Oh, clear him!

20:42.491 --> 20:43.951
Clear him!

20:44.952 --> 20:46.203
MAN 1: You're a liar.

20:46.286 --> 20:49.039
MAN 2: How is this assured to me?
How is delivery assured to me?

20:49.122 --> 20:50.457
-This is what I must know.
-Hey!

20:50.540 --> 20:52.918
I love this. I love this.

20:53.001 --> 20:54.169
(clamoring)

20:54.253 --> 20:56.546
-BOBBY: Okay! Hey! Hey! Hey!
-Officers, finally.

20:56.630 --> 20:58.298
Arrest this man. He is a liar.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.759
-Who called? Who called here?
-MAN 1: I was the one.

21:00.842 --> 21:02.552
He's a criminal. He's pimp gangster.

21:02.636 --> 21:04.179
-Arrest him!
-No, Kasim, please be quiet.

21:04.263 --> 21:06.014
Pleased to meet youse, officers.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.057
What's going on here?

21:07.140 --> 21:10.352
"Hector Lupa,
bail bonds and personal loans,

21:10.435 --> 21:13.063
a financial corporation incorporated."
How nice!

21:13.146 --> 21:14.356
It's my understanding

21:14.439 --> 21:17.526
that this gentleman
has lost an item of significant value.

21:17.734 --> 21:22.990
Now, several people have approached me
to return this item for a fee of $750.

21:23.073 --> 21:24.449
You're a dog in the gutter!

21:24.533 --> 21:25.951
What's in it for you there, Mr. Lupa?

21:26.034 --> 21:29.705
Another $750...
for my time, for my trouble.

21:29.788 --> 21:32.124
$1,500 total in all.

21:32.207 --> 21:34.376
-When Mr., uh...
-Bittar.

21:34.459 --> 21:37.170
-...gets his $3,000.
-That is half!

21:37.254 --> 21:39.298
That is-- All right, now you arrest him.

21:39.381 --> 21:41.466
LUPA: Hey, listen, go ahead, lock me up!

21:41.550 --> 21:44.177
(all shouting)

21:44.261 --> 21:45.595
-Mr. Lupa!
-Wait a minute!

21:45.679 --> 21:48.765
Get off me now! Hey! Hey!
You shut up,<i> you </i>shut up!

21:48.849 --> 21:51.351
Now, Mr. Bittar,
the report has been made on this.

21:51.435 --> 21:53.645
The perpetrators
are probably a long way away,

21:53.729 --> 21:56.732
and our chances of catching 'em now
are probably next to nothing.

21:57.357 --> 21:59.609
So, if you ever wanna see
any of your money again,

21:59.693 --> 22:02.612
I might suggest you at least listen
to what this man has to say.

22:02.696 --> 22:04.031
-No. Never.
-Wait, wait.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.783
BOBBY: Okay with us, sir,
but you already lost your ticket.

22:06.867 --> 22:09.244
It seems to me
that you have nothing else to lose

22:09.328 --> 22:10.329
and everything to gain.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.663
As we say in this country,

22:11.747 --> 22:14.291
"60 percent of something is better
than 100 percent of nothing."

22:15.876 --> 22:18.045
-No, no, no, no, no. No, no.
-One second.

22:18.128 --> 22:21.381
(speaking foreign language)

22:22.466 --> 22:24.259
Tick-tock, gentlemen. Tick-tock!

22:24.343 --> 22:25.927
-(speaking foreign language)
-WOMAN: Kasim!

22:26.136 --> 22:28.180
-Don't do it.
-I will accept offer.

22:28.263 --> 22:30.390
MAN: Armand... you are an idiot.

22:30.474 --> 22:32.934
Idiot! An idiot!

22:33.268 --> 22:35.562
You don't conduct business this way!

22:36.063 --> 22:37.981
-(door slams)
-I'm sorry for my brother-in-law.

22:38.065 --> 22:39.024
He thinks I'm very foolish

22:39.107 --> 22:41.735
because I am not in America
for a very long time.

22:42.277 --> 22:43.362
But my sister and I,

22:43.445 --> 22:47.532
we are very happy to win money
in America anyway.

22:47.783 --> 22:50.660
Uh, buy a new motor scooter, yes?

22:52.204 --> 22:53.747
(in low voice) It's pathetic.

22:53.830 --> 22:55.957
(police siren wailing)

22:58.752 --> 23:01.713
(police siren wailing)

23:01.797 --> 23:03.006
Officers!

23:04.049 --> 23:05.217
Excuse me.

23:07.719 --> 23:10.305
(police siren wailing continues)

23:11.264 --> 23:13.558
I'd appreciate it
if you were at the lottery office

23:13.642 --> 23:15.227
this afternoon for this transaction.

23:15.644 --> 23:16.645
Why is that?

23:17.687 --> 23:19.606
Well, if you're there,

23:19.773 --> 23:21.942
then these Arabs won't try
any funny stuff.

23:26.154 --> 23:29.574
Hey, look. I didn't have
to get involved here before.

23:29.658 --> 23:31.535
You know, for my slice, I'm just happy

23:31.618 --> 23:34.079
being the grease on the wheels
of your street justice.

23:34.162 --> 23:35.997
Okay, Mr. Lupa, 3:00.

23:36.081 --> 23:38.458
Excellent. Thank you very much.

23:39.292 --> 23:41.002
RENKO: Thank<i> you </i>very much.

23:41.086 --> 23:43.088
Oh, Bobby, I just love this.

23:43.171 --> 23:44.881
I love watching my day go kerplop

23:44.965 --> 23:46.883
in the company of these
lowlife street-types

23:46.967 --> 23:51.304
when our alleged friends are out somewhere
soaking up the fun and the sun

23:51.388 --> 23:54.141
in a casino watching the money roll in.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.726
The guy went just like that, Sarge.

23:56.810 --> 23:58.687
I mean, one minute,
he was running his mouth,

23:58.770 --> 24:00.981
-the next minute, he was blue.
-(chattering)

24:01.064 --> 24:03.900
Uh, I don't know. Hold on. I'll ask.

24:03.984 --> 24:05.152
Officer.

24:05.235 --> 24:07.779
My sergeant wants to know,
will there be an inquest?

24:07.863 --> 24:09.114
It's the coroner's call.

24:09.197 --> 24:11.366
You always take your prisoners
to the steam bath?

24:12.075 --> 24:15.996
The man had no cardiac history.
Those were his last words, all right?

24:16.705 --> 24:20.208
Uh, anyway, Sarge,
they want me to wait one more day

24:20.292 --> 24:22.169
just till they issue the certificate.

24:23.086 --> 24:24.087
Right.

24:25.172 --> 24:26.465
Right. I will.

24:27.424 --> 24:28.925
Okay. Bye.

24:30.260 --> 24:31.261
More?

24:32.637 --> 24:35.056
There's not gonna be any
trouble about this, is there?

24:35.474 --> 24:37.392
I wouldn't put it
in an extradition manual.

24:37.476 --> 24:39.936
-You are staying here if we need you.
-Yes, sir.

24:42.772 --> 24:44.774
How do you like it?
The guy went just like that, huh?

24:44.858 --> 24:45.901
It's the way they go.

24:47.110 --> 24:49.905
This is a pretty good argument
for enjoying yourself while you can.

24:49.988 --> 24:53.867
Oh, Mikey, nobody gives you
a contract for the sunrise.

24:54.451 --> 24:57.871
Hey, why don't you relax
and take a steam, huh?

24:57.954 --> 25:00.040
Eh. Maybe later.

25:02.125 --> 25:03.835
(chuckles)

25:03.919 --> 25:05.879
(chattering)

25:11.968 --> 25:14.221
Should have taken the Jefferson Loop.

25:14.304 --> 25:16.139
HARRY: Oh, Corrections
has their own routes, Pat.

25:17.682 --> 25:20.727
Yeah, I guess with a guy like Springer,
you don't take major thoroughfares.

25:22.979 --> 25:25.023
-(gunfire)
-Oh, no!

25:25.106 --> 25:26.525
-No.
-(police siren wailing)

25:26.608 --> 25:29.277
PATSY: MB-97! Springer's been shot!

25:29.361 --> 25:32.697
-Suspects fleeing in a white van!
-(police siren wailing continues)

25:32.781 --> 25:35.659
License plate "D", David...

25:35.742 --> 25:37.202
19755.

25:37.285 --> 25:39.079
Emergency backup. All units.

25:39.496 --> 25:41.790
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>MB-97, what's your location?</i>

25:41.873 --> 25:43.458
MAN (on radio):
<i>We're taking him to County General.</i>

25:43.542 --> 25:45.001
How is he? How is he?

25:45.085 --> 25:46.294
MAN:<i> Shot in the head.</i>

25:46.378 --> 25:48.630
WOMAN:<i> MB-97, repeat.</i>
<i>What's your location?</i>

25:48.713 --> 25:52.592
PATSY: Um, we're on McCandless Avenue
northbound at 155.

25:52.676 --> 25:56.930
(tires squealing)

25:57.013 --> 26:01.851
MB-97 now headed westbound,
alley between 155 and 156.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.187
(police siren wailing continues)

26:04.271 --> 26:06.648
-(tires screeching)
-Harry, look out!

26:15.073 --> 26:17.284
-PATSY: Come on.
-HARRY: I'm going! I'm going!

26:17.367 --> 26:19.786
-(horn honks)
-(tires screeching)

26:21.705 --> 26:22.664
Damn!

26:22.747 --> 26:24.207
MAN (on radio):<i> Springer's dead!</i>

26:26.501 --> 26:27.586
(typewriter clacking)

26:27.669 --> 26:30.088
-Nothing. Total loss.
-Do we have a perimeter?

26:30.171 --> 26:31.756
Twenty blocks,
down to the Avenue "B" overpass.

26:31.840 --> 26:33.633
Captain, they found the van.

26:33.717 --> 26:35.760
Alley off Hudson, 3200 block.

26:35.844 --> 26:37.095
Go. Rush any prints.

26:37.178 --> 26:39.097
Start a house-to-house
from the point of the van.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.099
Call Division.
We probably could use a helicopter.

26:41.182 --> 26:42.601
Right.

26:42.684 --> 26:45.520
Frank... I have to talk to you.

26:48.815 --> 26:52.110
I have no proof for any of this.
It's just for your story.

26:52.694 --> 26:56.114
He said he was hired to kill the mayor
by an ex-cop who called himself Fred.

26:56.197 --> 26:57.032
(thuds)

26:57.115 --> 26:59.075
Fred was working
for the Barletta brothers.

26:59.159 --> 27:00.869
The guys that restored
the Monarch Theater?

27:00.952 --> 27:04.164
Who also, according to Springer,
have a high-ranking cop in their pocket.

27:04.247 --> 27:07.709
Springer said it was the same cop
that had been spying on Cleveland.

27:07.792 --> 27:09.294
What cop? Does he have a name?

27:09.377 --> 27:12.213
He didn't say,
just that there was a high-ranking cop

27:12.756 --> 27:15.175
spying on Cleveland
before and after the election.

27:15.258 --> 27:16.509
-Did he say why--
-He said--

27:17.177 --> 27:20.096
Springer said-- And that was the same cop
the Barlettas bought.

27:20.180 --> 27:23.224
Did he say anything about why
the Barlettas wanted Cleveland killed?

27:23.308 --> 27:26.269
Apparently, they were desperate
about the redevelopment.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.355
Cleveland was opposing it,

27:29.147 --> 27:31.483
and they were leveraged
past the breaking point.

27:31.566 --> 27:32.651
(clicks tongue)

27:32.734 --> 27:36.655
Including that guy,
Biff Lowe, from the nonprofit committee.

27:36.738 --> 27:38.865
So they figured get Deputy Mayor Binachi
in their pocket,

27:38.948 --> 27:40.909
-they'd have a pushover.
-I don't know.

27:40.992 --> 27:43.119
Did he say anything else about
the ex-cop, where they met?

27:43.203 --> 27:45.288
-No.
-Did he say why a ranking cop

27:45.372 --> 27:47.957
would wanna be spying on Cleveland
and who he was doing it for?

27:48.041 --> 27:50.293
No, really, that's everything.

27:50.377 --> 27:53.463
Frank... Springer was afraid.
That's why he told me.

27:53.672 --> 27:55.173
Uh, in case that...

27:56.383 --> 27:57.592
Frank, am I at risk?

27:57.884 --> 28:00.512
There's no way for them to know
you had anything to do with Springer.

28:00.595 --> 28:03.139
What about the leaks? What about the cop
in the Barlettas' pocket?

28:03.223 --> 28:04.933
The cop isn't in this room, Joyce,

28:05.016 --> 28:06.559
and your association with Terry Springer

28:06.643 --> 28:08.144
-goes only as far as this room.
-(knocking)

28:08.228 --> 28:10.939
-Captain, the chief is in your office.
-Two seconds, Stan.

28:12.732 --> 28:15.652
Let's get the Barletta brothers in here
fast and Biff Lowe.

28:19.489 --> 28:21.574
Does this make me your
"Deep Throat," Frank?

28:21.658 --> 28:23.535
(telephones ringing)

28:25.120 --> 28:26.788
No, sir. No way.

28:27.288 --> 28:30.125
Don't give the damn department
a break for once.

28:30.625 --> 28:32.836
Don't give us a simple lone assassin.

28:32.919 --> 28:35.338
No, make it a conspiracy with an ex-cop,

28:35.422 --> 28:39.092
throw in my own damn man
spying on me for the assassins.

28:39.175 --> 28:41.636
Who was your man, Chief?
Who'd you have spying on Ozzie Cleveland?

28:41.720 --> 28:43.221
-A traitor and a Judas...
-The name!

28:43.304 --> 28:44.389
...from what it sounds like.

28:44.472 --> 28:46.766
-Who cares?
-My informant cares.

28:46.850 --> 28:48.768
My informant doesn't want
the word getting back

28:48.852 --> 28:50.979
to the Barletta brothers
what we have, neither do I.

28:51.896 --> 28:53.314
It's gonna come out anyway.

28:53.398 --> 28:54.941
And if the Barlettas
have a man in Division

28:55.024 --> 28:56.526
and we go after the Barlettas...

28:56.860 --> 28:57.861
(sighs)

28:57.944 --> 28:59.237
Keenan.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.322
Joe Keenan was your campaign plumber?

29:01.406 --> 29:02.782
He wasn't a plumber, Frank.

29:04.200 --> 29:05.577
All right, maybe he conducted

29:05.660 --> 29:08.204
some investigative work for me
above and beyond the call.

29:08.288 --> 29:10.331
What are we talking about? Wiretaps?

29:10.540 --> 29:13.293
Theft of papers? Paid informants?
Maybe a break-in or two?

29:13.376 --> 29:15.086
You think Ozzie was so clean?

29:15.170 --> 29:17.338
The man had been collecting
trash on me for three years.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.340
And for all of this "above and beyond,"

29:19.424 --> 29:21.468
Keenan's reward was special narcotics.

29:21.551 --> 29:23.344
Hey, that's enough.

29:24.846 --> 29:27.140
Well, it seems we have
two different problems here,

29:27.766 --> 29:29.726
corruption and finding
a couple of killers.

29:29.809 --> 29:32.562
One may be your job,
but tracking down these assassins is mine,

29:32.645 --> 29:33.813
and I won't be obstructed.

29:34.564 --> 29:36.441
(paper rustling)

29:36.524 --> 29:37.525
You won't be.

29:39.194 --> 29:40.069
Not by me.

29:40.737 --> 29:41.863
(rustles)

29:42.739 --> 29:43.865
What are these?

29:44.324 --> 29:48.453
My campaign files on Cleveland,
everything Joe Keenan ever collected.

29:49.078 --> 29:51.581
A couple folders are marked
"Barletta Construction."

29:51.664 --> 29:52.791
For openers,

29:53.208 --> 29:57.295
they gave Ozzie Cleveland 37 large ones
in unreported campaign gifts.

29:58.338 --> 30:00.006
Wherever these lead, understood?

30:00.089 --> 30:01.382
Understood.

30:01.466 --> 30:02.801
And not a word to Joe Keenan.

30:03.676 --> 30:05.929
(scoffs) The problem
with plumbers, Frank...

30:08.097 --> 30:10.266
you never know whose pipes
they're working on.

30:11.226 --> 30:12.560
(door closes)

30:12.977 --> 30:14.604
-Hey, Sarge!
-STAN: Hi.

30:14.854 --> 30:16.981
You got a phone call, Sarge.

30:17.065 --> 30:18.358
-Female?
-Yeah.

30:26.533 --> 30:27.408
Vera?

30:30.411 --> 30:32.747
Aw, come on.
Cut out the heavy breathing, will you?

30:34.749 --> 30:36.000
Vera, is that you?

30:38.044 --> 30:39.003
(telephone thuds)

30:39.629 --> 30:41.965
Excuse me. I'm looking for Sergeant Bates.

30:42.549 --> 30:44.217
Uh, that way. That way.

30:45.802 --> 30:48.096
(chattering)

30:52.267 --> 30:53.768
I'm looking for Sergeant Bates.

30:53.852 --> 30:54.978
Yeah, that's me.

30:56.980 --> 30:58.439
This kid said you were his mother.

30:59.440 --> 31:00.692
Why aren't you in school?

31:02.277 --> 31:03.653
What does this mean?

31:03.736 --> 31:05.947
Kid was busting windows, throwing rocks.

31:06.030 --> 31:07.824
Maybe you ought to sit down
with the kid and let him know

31:07.907 --> 31:09.742
if he does it again,
he's gonna get charged.

31:09.826 --> 31:12.120
Believe me, I got better things
to do than chase delinquents.

31:12.203 --> 31:13.580
He's not a delinquent.

31:13.997 --> 31:15.748
I think I can handle
this one from here, Officer.

31:17.292 --> 31:18.543
Keep your nose clean, kid.

31:20.920 --> 31:22.171
Start talking.

31:23.798 --> 31:25.466
First of all, why weren't you in school?

31:25.550 --> 31:27.218
They wanted to put me in remedial.

31:27.302 --> 31:29.804
That's so you can catch up.
That is what "remedial" means.

31:29.888 --> 31:31.431
You haven't even been
to school for over a year.

31:31.514 --> 31:33.266
What do you think,
they're gonna make you the teacher?

31:33.349 --> 31:35.143
I'm smarter than those other kids!

31:35.226 --> 31:36.895
How smart is a kid
who doesn't want to go to school,

31:36.978 --> 31:38.187
who doesn't even want to learn?

31:39.480 --> 31:41.399
I told you it wasn't gonna work out.

31:41.691 --> 31:43.026
So why don't we just quit each other?

31:43.109 --> 31:45.361
Oh, perfect, right?
What is this, some kind of test?

31:45.445 --> 31:47.614
Were you trying to see how soon
you can make me fold my cards?

31:47.697 --> 31:50.283
Is that it? Forget about it.

31:50.366 --> 31:52.869
You are stuck with me,
good or bad, like it or not.

31:55.622 --> 31:56.623
(sighs)

31:56.706 --> 31:58.416
A lot of changes the last couple of days.

31:59.417 --> 32:00.293
Yeah.

32:01.461 --> 32:02.587
For both of us.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.009
-(papers rustling)
-Let's go.

32:11.971 --> 32:14.223
One, two, three, four, five...

32:15.683 --> 32:18.353
six, seven, eight, nine... 3,000.

32:18.436 --> 32:19.395
Yeah. (sighs)

32:19.479 --> 32:21.314
A little bit unusual
for us to pay out in cash,

32:21.397 --> 32:22.273
but we're happy to accommodate.

32:22.357 --> 32:24.692
-Thank you very much, miss.
-Congratulations, Mr. Bittar.

32:24.776 --> 32:26.444
Good. For Mr. Lupa, yes?

32:26.527 --> 32:28.446
Armand, Armand, listen.
You're dealing with a scoundrel.

32:28.529 --> 32:30.198
You have the money now. Why give it?

32:30.281 --> 32:32.659
-You could as soon throw it in the street.
-Kasim, please leave me alone.

32:32.742 --> 32:34.661
Armand, don't do this.
It's madness. Armand.

32:34.744 --> 32:35.828
-Kasim.
-Listen to sense, please!

32:35.912 --> 32:40.375
Let us try to conduct ourselves
in a gentlemanly fashion, shall we?

32:40.458 --> 32:42.043
-No.
-Mr. Lupa?

32:42.210 --> 32:44.045
-No!
-It is done, Kasim. Stop it!

32:44.128 --> 32:47.507
-You will find it's all there.
-Of course it is.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.217
-(mumbles)
-You...

32:49.300 --> 32:50.426
You.

32:51.386 --> 32:52.679
You are a leech,

32:52.762 --> 32:55.181
a leech living off
the good fortune of others.

32:55.264 --> 32:56.683
(spits)

32:58.559 --> 33:01.312
Well, now, I suppose you want us
to walk you to your car, don't you?

33:01.396 --> 33:04.649
No, I can handle it myself from here.

33:04.732 --> 33:05.942
I'll bet you can.

33:06.693 --> 33:09.696
Well, all things considered,
I'd call that a pretty fair example

33:09.779 --> 33:12.240
of impromptu community service,
wouldn't you?

33:12.323 --> 33:13.825
BOBBY: All in a day's work, son.

33:14.742 --> 33:18.121
The Barlettas consider Ozzie Cleveland,
personally, a good friend

33:18.204 --> 33:20.623
and a terrific friend
of the Monarch Theater project.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.834
They've had their minor differences,
but so what?

33:23.126 --> 33:24.460
Again, who's Fred?

33:24.544 --> 33:25.962
And I said, "Fred who?"

33:26.045 --> 33:28.297
Look, my clients know a lot
of people named Fred, Captain.

33:28.923 --> 33:31.426
To their best knowledge, none are ex-cops.

33:31.509 --> 33:33.594
We don't like cops, ex or otherwise.

33:33.678 --> 33:36.681
What about contributions
to Ozzie Cleveland's political campaign?

33:36.764 --> 33:39.392
Hey, that guy wants to be mayor.

33:39.475 --> 33:42.186
Why not? They should get
a chance to advance themselves.

33:42.270 --> 33:44.480
What do you say we about wrap
this thing up, huh, Captain?

33:46.983 --> 33:50.278
I feel simply dreadful
about this whole damn business.

33:50.361 --> 33:52.196
I mean, Oz being shot at?

33:54.240 --> 33:58.244
And now, to have this perfectly ludicrous
accusation being leveled at me!

33:58.327 --> 33:59.996
FRANK: Let me put it another way.

34:00.288 --> 34:03.583
What can you let us have
on your business partners, the Barlettas?

34:03.666 --> 34:07.628
And that is ludicrous, too, may I add.
These are first-rate gentlemen.

34:07.712 --> 34:10.298
With whom you have made
your financial dealings.

34:10.381 --> 34:13.926
(chuckling) Well, there is certainly
no law against that, Captain.

34:14.010 --> 34:15.386
I am a legal investor

34:15.470 --> 34:18.681
with full faith and confidence
in the Monarch Theater project.

34:18.848 --> 34:22.685
I have tried my damnedest
to do something to help these people,

34:22.977 --> 34:25.063
to help your community, Captain.

34:26.230 --> 34:28.483
And I feel perfectly crucified for it.

34:28.566 --> 34:30.693
My palms bleed for you, Mr. Lowe.

34:35.031 --> 34:38.284
-(telephone ringing)
-(chattering)

34:40.912 --> 34:42.455
Shooting, guys. Come with me.

34:45.875 --> 34:48.711
(police siren wails)

34:51.881 --> 34:52.924
-That's the brother-in-law.
-What do you think?

34:53.007 --> 34:54.425
I don't see that?
You think I don't see that?

34:54.509 --> 34:58.429
He had a pistol and he demanded
that I give him back $750.

34:58.513 --> 35:00.765
These officers know
what I'm talking about!

35:00.848 --> 35:02.892
These are the officers
you talked with before?

35:02.975 --> 35:03.893
Yeah.

35:04.310 --> 35:06.771
-One thing at a time.
-(clears throat)

35:07.230 --> 35:09.607
-RENKO: You say he threatened you...
-We're in it now, Bobby Hill.

35:09.690 --> 35:11.067
-We're in it now.
-We'll talk to the sarge.

35:11.150 --> 35:13.111
We'll talk to him first before anybody,
you understand?

35:13.194 --> 35:15.738
Yeah, I understand real good.
I understand real good.

35:15.822 --> 35:17.198
I understand everything.

35:22.495 --> 35:26.457
It is a wonderful thing
to win this moneys, isn't it?

35:27.667 --> 35:29.043
I am a lucky man.

35:31.337 --> 35:34.215
(voice breaking)
This was supposed to be the best day...

35:35.550 --> 35:37.343
the best day of my life.

35:41.931 --> 35:44.142
My winnings will pay for his funeral.

35:45.685 --> 35:46.769
I didn't tell her.

35:48.521 --> 35:51.816
I have to tell my sister
that her husband...

35:52.358 --> 35:53.359
is dead.

35:54.652 --> 35:55.611
Would you like for us--

35:57.488 --> 35:59.407
You have done enough already, yes?

36:01.325 --> 36:02.243
Yes?

36:03.536 --> 36:06.372
I think so. I think so.

36:08.875 --> 36:11.377
(indistinct talking on police radio)

36:15.590 --> 36:18.718
(slow jazz music playing)

36:22.555 --> 36:23.431
Hi.

36:25.933 --> 36:27.059
Hi.

36:27.393 --> 36:29.187
Are you going to ask me to sit down?

36:30.396 --> 36:31.314
Sit.

36:39.405 --> 36:41.866
-Do I know you?
-I know<i> you </i>a little bit.

36:41.949 --> 36:43.451
-From where?
-From this morning.

36:43.534 --> 36:44.577
I saw you win the jackpot.

36:48.873 --> 36:51.083
You became a cowboy since then.

36:51.167 --> 36:52.043
(chuckles)

36:52.126 --> 36:54.879
I just, uh, bought this, you know.

36:54.962 --> 36:57.840
If I'd have known,
I'd have worn my cowgirl outfit.

36:57.924 --> 37:01.219
(chuckling) Who are you? What's going on?

37:06.599 --> 37:07.683
What do you think?

37:10.061 --> 37:11.437
I think you're trying to pick me up.

37:11.646 --> 37:13.564
How am I doing?

37:13.648 --> 37:14.815
Pretty good.

37:22.531 --> 37:26.494
Seven out, flying away.
Last comes and they do not get paid.

37:26.577 --> 37:28.037
I don't believe this.

37:28.371 --> 37:29.497
They're coming out.

37:29.997 --> 37:32.124
Crap, 11, any seven, two, three, and 12...

37:32.208 --> 37:34.669
-They're coming out on the front lines.
-Hiya, Joey.

37:35.127 --> 37:36.420
What are you doing here?

37:36.712 --> 37:38.130
What happened to your prisoner?

37:38.631 --> 37:41.008
Oh. He croaked.

37:42.051 --> 37:43.511
Do you believe that?

37:44.011 --> 37:45.805
(laughs)

37:45.888 --> 37:48.015
Oh, hey, come here.

37:49.016 --> 37:51.394
I wanna borrow your room key.

37:51.477 --> 37:52.812
Are you shooting, sir?

37:53.312 --> 37:56.232
-No, pass the dice.
-New shooter's coming out.

37:56.315 --> 37:57.858
Yeah, I can see where you'd need it.

37:57.942 --> 38:00.319
Mm-mm-mm.<i> Incorrecto.</i>

38:00.403 --> 38:02.905
-Look, I'm not your warden.
-MAN: Crap 11.

38:02.989 --> 38:05.574
Hey, listen, do you think
you could let me hold another hundred?

38:06.909 --> 38:08.995
-MAN: Five is the number.
-Correcto!

38:09.078 --> 38:10.079
Ah, great. Thanks.

38:10.371 --> 38:11.539
Thank you.

38:12.206 --> 38:16.168
MAN: Come bet, feel bet.
Five is the line, place the nine.

38:16.252 --> 38:18.421
-Change.
-MAN: You gonna come bet or feel bet?

38:19.422 --> 38:21.090
(door opens, closes)

38:27.054 --> 38:28.681
You travel heavy, Mick.

38:29.557 --> 38:31.642
Oh, no, no.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.936
Didn't I explain that to you?

38:34.228 --> 38:35.146
Mm-mm.

38:36.230 --> 38:37.189
Oh.

38:38.524 --> 38:39.567
Well...

38:41.152 --> 38:43.487
-(thuds)
-it's just my buddy's stuff...

38:43.571 --> 38:45.281
and they're all downstairs.

38:45.364 --> 38:47.074
Then we have the place to ourselves.

38:50.077 --> 38:53.664
Would you look at this?
Isn't this something?

38:53.748 --> 38:57.293
I mean, this is elegant in the extremes.

38:57.376 --> 38:58.419
Mm-hmm.

38:59.503 --> 39:01.714
It's pretty nice.

39:03.215 --> 39:05.760
Well... shall we get comfortable?

39:05.843 --> 39:07.636
(groans) Oh, boy.

39:08.429 --> 39:11.724
(chuckles) Whew.

39:23.569 --> 39:25.279
I'm gonna tell you something.

39:28.908 --> 39:29.825
What?

39:33.079 --> 39:36.040
I can't go to bed with you
'cause I got a girlfriend.

39:37.708 --> 39:39.960
I don't kiss and tell, Mick.

39:40.044 --> 39:41.253
(both laugh)

39:41.587 --> 39:44.590
(snorts, laughs) I know.

39:48.677 --> 39:49.804
I can't.

39:53.808 --> 39:55.684
But I wanna take care of your time.

40:00.606 --> 40:01.524
Okay.

40:01.816 --> 40:02.817
(clears throat)

40:03.567 --> 40:05.528
Okay, you got to tell me what's right.

40:06.904 --> 40:08.781
(sighs) Well, I gotta say $200.

40:10.741 --> 40:11.867
Oh, boy.

40:12.326 --> 40:13.869
(chuckles) Ooh.

40:32.763 --> 40:33.639
Thank you.

40:36.350 --> 40:38.978
(sighs) I wish that you'd
have let me earn it, Mick.

40:42.273 --> 40:43.983
You don't understand.

40:44.191 --> 40:45.151
You<i> did.</i>

40:47.862 --> 40:50.239
I had such a terrific time.

40:52.741 --> 40:54.160
Oh, boy.

40:55.828 --> 40:57.204
Oh!

40:57.788 --> 40:59.206
(sighs)

41:02.126 --> 41:04.003
You want me to take your boots off?

41:06.297 --> 41:08.757
Why don't you reach around
and pat yourselves on the back, fellas?

41:08.841 --> 41:10.259
Or are you expecting me to do it for you?

41:10.342 --> 41:12.428
No, Sarge. It just seemed
like the best way, you know?

41:12.511 --> 41:13.888
Of course, one foot in front of the other,

41:13.971 --> 41:16.640
ordinary police work,
obviously, wasn't in order.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.225
You had to shortcut the whole process--

41:18.309 --> 41:20.644
Sarge, we aren't denying
that we were wrong,

41:20.728 --> 41:22.104
but there was no way for us to know that.

41:22.188 --> 41:24.648
Get it through your skulls,
you're out there to catch 'em.

41:24.732 --> 41:26.942
That's it. King Solomons, you ain't.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.278
We already got guys get paid for that.
They wear black robes.

41:29.361 --> 41:31.405
Look, we had a situation.
We thought it over.

41:31.489 --> 41:32.656
We done the best we could, okay?

41:32.740 --> 41:33.657
Why didn't you ask him

41:33.741 --> 41:36.202
if he'd trade off his sister's husband
for money straight up?

41:36.285 --> 41:37.286
Think he'd go for that?

41:37.369 --> 41:38.496
Maybe we're not blessed
with 20-20 hindsight like you are!

41:38.579 --> 41:40.289
If you're gonna start dishing out
your own brand of justice,

41:40.372 --> 41:41.665
you better make damn well sure you<i> do--</i>

41:41.749 --> 41:43.417
Real easy when you're sitting
behind a desk all day.

41:43.501 --> 41:44.960
You wasn't there!

41:45.044 --> 41:46.712
Lucky for you I wasn't, pal,
'cause you'd get busted

41:46.795 --> 41:49.715
down to school patrol so fast
your eyes would spin!

41:49.798 --> 41:51.842
It was bonehead, get it?

41:51.926 --> 41:54.178
No excuses, no nothing,
bonehead, the both of you.

41:57.097 --> 41:59.558
We get a complaint from a citizen,
it goes to IAD,

41:59.642 --> 42:01.560
your whole damn careers
could hang by a thread.

42:01.644 --> 42:04.063
Maybe it goes to IAD anyway.

42:04.480 --> 42:07.107
You sit down and you write it up,
you get it to me in 20 minutes.

42:07.191 --> 42:10.236
And don't you ever jump back
at me like that again.

42:11.862 --> 42:13.614
I was out there pounding the beat

42:13.697 --> 42:15.783
when you were crawling up
your mama's drapes.

42:17.159 --> 42:18.244
Twenty minutes.

42:18.869 --> 42:21.330
(door opens, closes)

42:22.790 --> 42:25.376
FRANK: How bad? Is he conscious?

42:25.459 --> 42:26.544
(bangs on door)

42:26.752 --> 42:29.296
I'll be right there.
Stay on top of ballistics.

42:30.631 --> 42:33.926
In the "small-world" department,
try this one on for size.

42:34.635 --> 42:36.387
A man keels over with a coronary

42:36.470 --> 42:39.265
as he's about to board
a plane for St. Louis.

42:39.890 --> 42:43.978
No ID, just a ticket and a baggage claim.

42:44.061 --> 42:47.439
Buried under the shirts and stuff
is a recently-fired Uzi.

42:47.523 --> 42:51.068
-The gun that killed Terry Springer?
-Well, they're testing it, but I'd say so.

42:51.318 --> 42:54.071
Also in the suitcase
are a wallet and a passport...

42:54.947 --> 42:56.198
Jerry Fuchs.

42:56.448 --> 42:58.576
You're kidding? Jerry Fuchs?

42:58.659 --> 42:59.994
A.K.A. Fred.

43:03.789 --> 43:06.125
(monitor beeping)

43:20.055 --> 43:21.181
Jerry.

43:24.351 --> 43:25.352
Frank.

43:26.562 --> 43:27.438
(scoffs)

43:28.355 --> 43:29.481
Do you believe this?

43:31.525 --> 43:33.527
One minute I'm running to catch a plane,

43:34.528 --> 43:37.323
next thing I'm flat
on my face sucking floor.

43:38.115 --> 43:41.201
We have your suitcase,
we have your weapon, and we have you.

43:41.869 --> 43:44.622
Frank, please, listen to me.

43:45.080 --> 43:46.665
Save the excuses, Jerry.

43:47.207 --> 43:48.834
Don't take that tone with me.

43:50.002 --> 43:51.879
I ain't the only one involved here.

43:52.963 --> 43:53.881
Who else?

43:55.007 --> 43:56.508
It's gonna cost you, Frank.

43:57.635 --> 44:00.054
You may have my ticket,
but you ain't gonna punch it.

44:01.221 --> 44:05.017
We got more business to do
on this than you could (coughs)

44:06.769 --> 44:08.354
possibly imagine.

44:09.605 --> 44:10.814
(door creaks)

44:15.861 --> 44:18.697
Whatever business it is, Captain, it, uh,
it'll have to wait.

44:19.531 --> 44:21.158
(monitor beeping)

44:23.369 --> 44:25.371
(chattering)

44:39.009 --> 44:40.719
This is not going to IAD.

44:42.304 --> 44:45.265
Probably this nutball gets himself shot
no matter what you do.

44:45.641 --> 44:47.101
But understand one thing...

44:48.060 --> 44:50.104
you disrespected the process.

44:50.854 --> 44:51.855
Judgment call, Sarge.

44:51.939 --> 44:54.066
Nobody's gonna shut you down
for a judgment call.

44:54.149 --> 44:55.567
That's 80 percent of it out there.

44:55.651 --> 44:58.445
But you make a judgment call,
you better ask yourself one question.

44:58.904 --> 45:02.032
What does Sergeant Stan Jablonski do
in the same situation?

45:02.116 --> 45:05.953
'Cause I'm gonna hold you
accountable for it every time.

45:07.913 --> 45:08.872
Got that clear?

45:09.456 --> 45:10.290
Yes, sir.

45:10.624 --> 45:11.458
Yes, sir.

45:12.876 --> 45:13.711
Okay.

45:15.587 --> 45:16.422
So, good night.

45:18.382 --> 45:19.258
Good night.

45:19.758 --> 45:21.468
Uh, Sarge (clears throat)

45:21.552 --> 45:22.511
Um...

45:23.429 --> 45:24.638
Could we buy you a beer?

45:26.181 --> 45:27.474
Maybe some other time.

45:34.898 --> 45:35.733
Mick!

45:37.651 --> 45:40.320
What are you doing here? Judas!

45:41.071 --> 45:42.406
Where's your prisoner, Mick?

45:42.865 --> 45:44.825
(wheezes, coughs)

45:45.576 --> 45:46.785
He croaked.

45:47.494 --> 45:49.621
Who dressed you in the cowboy suit?

45:50.247 --> 45:52.624
(groans)

45:52.708 --> 45:55.002
-Oh, no.
-What?

45:55.544 --> 45:57.212
-Oh, no!
-HOWARD: What?

45:57.379 --> 45:59.339
My money's gone. She robbed me!

45:59.423 --> 46:03.761
Mick, uh, I wouldn't
put out any APB's just yet.

46:03.969 --> 46:06.263
(chattering)

46:14.563 --> 46:16.857
-Let's go.
-Hey, Mick, what's goin' on?

46:16.940 --> 46:20.277
-Want a card, sir?
-He does not want a card!

46:20.360 --> 46:21.945
-You got a problem, fellas?
-Yes, we do.

46:22.029 --> 46:23.781
We got a problem. I want that money back.

46:23.864 --> 46:25.032
I don't want him playing this hand.

46:25.866 --> 46:27.242
But the cards have been dealt.

46:28.619 --> 46:32.247
This guy is a thief.
He's playing with stolen money.

46:32.331 --> 46:33.499
Fold 'em up.

46:33.874 --> 46:35.459
Take it out of the casino, will you?

46:39.296 --> 46:41.590
(coins jangling)

46:50.265 --> 46:51.767
Go ahead, explain it to me.

46:54.561 --> 46:56.313
-Well, I didn't steal your money.
-You're a liar.

46:56.688 --> 46:58.315
LaRue said you went upstairs dead broke,

46:58.398 --> 47:00.317
and when you came back down,
you were betting hundreds.

47:00.400 --> 47:03.195
Yeah, all right, I took your money,
but I was gonna pay you back.

47:03.278 --> 47:04.696
Just give me what's left.

47:08.033 --> 47:08.951
MAN: Good evening.

47:11.662 --> 47:12.996
It's 500 bucks.

47:13.997 --> 47:15.374
Five hundred?

47:16.792 --> 47:18.418
What the hell happened to the rest of it?

47:18.502 --> 47:19.670
That's all there is.

47:21.296 --> 47:24.007
You lost over $3,000?

47:24.091 --> 47:26.885
Yeah, well, I was down to $100,
and I started to come back.

47:26.969 --> 47:28.637
-Will you just let me keep playing?
-The hell with you!

47:28.720 --> 47:31.014
I'm begging you, give me a chance
to just win it back at least!

47:31.098 --> 47:32.391
Or lose the rest of it!

47:32.641 --> 47:35.352
-It's a lousy 500 bucks, man!
-You know how long it takes me?

47:35.435 --> 47:39.231
It takes me two weeks
to take home 500 lousy bucks!

47:44.069 --> 47:47.531
Hey, Mick, Mick, come on!
Let me play with what's left, man.

47:47.614 --> 47:50.242
-Stay away from me!
-Hey, take it easy, Joe.

47:50.325 --> 47:52.578
You should be ashamed of yourself.

48:02.337 --> 48:05.215
(closing theme playing)
