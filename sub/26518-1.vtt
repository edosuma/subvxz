00:26.799 --> 00:29.280
Aiko's on the move,
and she's bringing company.

00:29.323 --> 00:31.586
Copy that.
I'm in position.

00:36.809 --> 00:38.289
Sorry.

00:43.337 --> 00:45.948
Good day!

00:45.992 --> 00:48.777
I would please like drink...

00:55.697 --> 00:57.873
What kind of criminal
wants to meet in a place

00:57.917 --> 00:59.135
that confiscates guns?

00:59.179 --> 01:00.528
You, apparently.
Mm.

01:00.572 --> 01:02.878
This was not my idea.
If I had my way,

01:02.922 --> 01:04.663
I'd be shacked up in
a love hotel right now,

01:04.706 --> 01:06.404
eating Hi-Chews
off a freshly-waxed...

01:06.447 --> 01:08.231
This is Yakuza
neutral territory.

01:08.275 --> 01:10.016
Aiko and her men
will be unarmed too.

01:10.059 --> 01:11.452
Yeah, well, what about
those guys up there, huh?

01:11.496 --> 01:13.715
House security, pistols only.

01:13.759 --> 01:16.414
I don't like it.
It's like the time we went

01:16.457 --> 01:18.633
to Sho Ahktar's
penthouse party "sans guns."

01:18.677 --> 01:20.809
I think we all remember what
happened there, am I right?

01:22.724 --> 01:24.944
Oh, my God! You don't
remember, do you?

01:24.987 --> 01:27.642
Bits and pieces. But with
the ZIP poisoning, I...

01:27.686 --> 01:29.601
Great, I'm on a
complicated off-books heist

01:29.644 --> 01:30.950
with the guy from "Memento."

01:30.993 --> 01:35.389
I remember the plan, Rich.
It's not complicated.

01:35.433 --> 01:37.435
First, Patterson
plays tourist...

01:37.478 --> 01:40.960
Smooth? Uh...

01:41.003 --> 01:42.701
Oh, can I see that bottle,
actually?

01:42.744 --> 01:44.659
Getting the bartender to
hand her a particular bottle

01:44.703 --> 01:48.402
so she can attach a small
electromagnetic listening device.

01:48.446 --> 01:51.666
Then, Aiko Matsuo arrives
to meet "Simon North,"

01:51.710 --> 01:54.365
American businessman-turned-
traitor played by you.

01:54.408 --> 01:58.499
Aiko accepts the sword as payment for the
CIA Noc list she thinks you're here for,

01:58.543 --> 02:01.502
a list that she will retrieve
from a super-secure safe,

02:01.546 --> 02:04.026
and once she does,
Patterson's EM device

02:04.070 --> 02:05.419
will pick up the combination.

02:05.463 --> 02:07.552
Once Aiko leaves,
Reade creates a diversion,

02:07.595 --> 02:09.467
giving Patterson time
to re-open the safe

02:09.509 --> 02:11.904
and grab what we
really came here for,

02:11.947 --> 02:14.950
Roman's fourth data cache.

02:14.994 --> 02:17.736
Here.

02:17.779 --> 02:19.781
Man, I know Roman had
a few screws loose,

02:19.825 --> 02:21.696
no disrespect to the dead,
but hiding these things

02:21.740 --> 02:23.263
in the most dangerous
places in the world

02:23.306 --> 02:25.570
is a real "screw you" from
beyond the grave, you know?

02:25.613 --> 02:28.311
These caches were like
his back-up hard drive

02:28.355 --> 02:30.226
in case something
happened to him.

02:30.270 --> 02:31.445
He needed them secure

02:31.489 --> 02:32.881
so they didn't fall
into the wrong hands.

02:32.925 --> 02:35.231
Granted, but it's been three
months since Roman died,

02:35.275 --> 02:38.887
and getting them into the right hands
is proving to be a real cluster-cuss.

02:38.931 --> 02:40.411
Aiko's here.

02:42.630 --> 02:45.198
They're unarmed.
So far, so good.

02:45.241 --> 02:48.070
Remember, you're Simon North,
respectful businessman.

02:48.114 --> 02:49.420
Don't blow this.

03:00.561 --> 03:03.434
Simon, your Japanese is good.

03:03.477 --> 03:06.393
Aiko, your English is better.

03:06.437 --> 03:08.439
Before we complete
our transaction,

03:08.482 --> 03:12.094
may I suggest
a friendly game of Go?

03:12.138 --> 03:13.400
Why is she stalling?

03:13.444 --> 03:14.575
Are you familiar with the rules?

03:14.619 --> 03:16.925
Of Go? Intimately.

03:16.969 --> 03:18.753
We don't want to miss
your flight, Mr. North.

03:18.797 --> 03:21.495
Don't worry.
This'll be quick.

03:21.539 --> 03:24.585
Yes. It will.

03:30.504 --> 03:31.940
An unusual opening move.

03:31.984 --> 03:34.813
Arigato. That was not a compliment.

03:34.856 --> 03:36.292
You need to lose this game

03:36.336 --> 03:37.555
and quickly.

03:37.598 --> 03:39.165
Keep your mind
on the mission, Rich.

03:39.208 --> 03:42.298
Did you know, there are
more potential moves in Go

03:42.342 --> 03:44.518
than there are atoms
in the galaxy?

03:44.562 --> 03:45.824
The universe, actually.

03:45.867 --> 03:47.608
Go is more complex than chess,

03:47.652 --> 03:50.829
more nuanced than
the finest GewuÃ¼rztraminer.

03:50.872 --> 03:53.309
That's German wine.
Exactly.

03:53.353 --> 03:54.485
Which is why a computer

03:54.528 --> 03:56.965
has never bested
a true human master.

03:57.009 --> 03:58.619
Well, that's not
entirely accurate.

03:58.663 --> 04:00.012
I don't like this.

04:00.055 --> 04:02.405
Tank the game, and let's
get out of here, Rich.

04:02.449 --> 04:04.059
Come on. A machine has bested

04:04.103 --> 04:06.801
a human master at Go.
It was more of a beat-down,

04:06.845 --> 04:08.324
if we're being semantically correct.

04:08.368 --> 04:10.370
You see, a machine is only as good

04:10.413 --> 04:11.893
as the man who programs it.

04:11.937 --> 04:14.156
Or woman.

04:14.200 --> 04:16.028
There are plenty of
talented female programmers,

04:16.071 --> 04:17.682
but this one
happened to be a man,

04:17.725 --> 04:21.423
and this man happened
to be very, very good.

04:21.468 --> 04:26.168
Rich DotCom.

04:26.212 --> 04:30.999
Famously talented
and famously arrogant

04:31.043 --> 04:36.135
and currently losing
to me at Go.

04:40.226 --> 04:42.010
This is very not good.

04:42.054 --> 04:44.970
Oh, I don't know what you think,

04:45.013 --> 04:48.408
but my name is Simon,
Simon North.

04:48.451 --> 04:49.583
I'm the guy that
brought you the sword.

04:49.627 --> 04:51.237
I just wanted to
betray my country.

04:51.280 --> 04:52.891
That's not a crime, is it?

04:52.934 --> 04:54.849
My apologies for the subterfuge.

04:54.893 --> 04:57.504
You have many enemies
here in Japan,

04:57.548 --> 04:58.853
men willing to pay a large sum

04:58.897 --> 05:00.551
to have you under their control.

05:00.594 --> 05:02.553
I'm flattered?

05:19.221 --> 05:20.658
You just had to play
the game, didn't you?!

05:20.701 --> 05:21.789
Hey, this is on you, all right?

05:21.833 --> 05:23.051
I wanted my cover name
to be Brutus.

05:23.095 --> 05:24.879
I told you no one's
buying me as a Simon.

05:24.923 --> 05:27.055
Enough! I need your help!
I didn't get the combination,

05:27.099 --> 05:28.883
but I think I can use
a mix of the bar's dry ice

05:28.927 --> 05:31.059
with some of these alcohols
to make a cryogenic fluid.

05:31.103 --> 05:32.844
To freeze the lock!
That's brilliant!

05:32.887 --> 05:34.585
Yeah, but all of these
labels are in Japanese.

05:34.628 --> 05:37.762
So, what is a sideways smiley
face with some quote marks?

05:37.805 --> 05:38.980
Is that vodka or gin?

05:39.024 --> 05:40.895
I don't know.
Try it and find out.

05:47.946 --> 05:49.948
Stay behind me.
Gladly!

06:24.852 --> 06:26.332
Hey, hey, okay.
All right.

06:34.601 --> 06:36.603
Oh, yeah, that's gin.

06:55.187 --> 06:56.362
Oh!

06:57.624 --> 06:59.191
Okay, that is
definitely in my top five

06:59.234 --> 07:01.846
sexiest all-time
rooftop swordfights.

07:02.934 --> 07:04.675
Oh, no.

07:07.068 --> 07:09.723
What?
She's got two swords?

07:09.767 --> 07:11.333
That doesn't seem fair.

07:11.377 --> 07:13.335
Patterson, how long
'til you crack it?

07:13.379 --> 07:15.381
Close... ish.

07:18.297 --> 07:19.298
He's reloading.

07:22.780 --> 07:24.869
Okay, okay, okay.

07:24.912 --> 07:26.740
Come on, come on. The local police
is on their way.

07:26.784 --> 07:28.394
Come on, come on.

07:28.437 --> 07:29.656
All right, give that to me.

07:32.398 --> 07:33.704
I'm in!
Grab it! Let's go!

07:34.574 --> 07:35.880
Got it!

07:35.923 --> 07:37.664
You know what?
It seems like you got this.

07:37.708 --> 07:39.405
I don't want to...
Too many cooks, et cetera.

07:57.640 --> 07:58.685
Hah!

07:58.729 --> 07:59.947
Eh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

08:23.275 --> 08:26.713
Take my life.
Let me die in combat.

08:26.757 --> 08:28.889
No can do, Matsuo-san.

08:28.933 --> 08:31.196
See, we're FBI.
We don't just randomly

08:31.239 --> 08:33.807
execute people for no reason.

08:35.113 --> 08:36.809
O...

08:36.854 --> 08:39.246
kay, I guess sometimes we do.

08:39.291 --> 08:40.683
Jeez.Hey.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.642
We gotta go,
unless we wanna end up

08:42.684 --> 08:43.643
in a Japanese black site.

08:43.686 --> 08:44.905
Chopper's almost here.

08:44.949 --> 08:48.909
Jane, are you okay?

08:49.823 --> 08:51.085
Never better.

08:55.200 --> 08:59.630

09:12.498 --> 09:13.847
You're back.

09:15.240 --> 09:17.198
We got in early.

09:17.242 --> 09:18.809
Not early enough.

09:18.852 --> 09:20.071
Come here.

09:22.638 --> 09:23.857
I missed you.

09:23.901 --> 09:26.251
I know.
I got your texts.

09:26.294 --> 09:27.121
Too much?

09:27.165 --> 09:30.124
Way too much.

09:30.168 --> 09:32.692
What? Hey, you're not
wearing your brace.

09:32.735 --> 09:36.870
No. The physical therapist said
that I could go without it.

09:36.914 --> 09:40.874
Hey, look. I went for
a drive this morning.

09:40.918 --> 09:43.877
You drove?
On your own? Kurt...

09:43.921 --> 09:46.488
Jane, I'm fine. Really.

09:46.532 --> 09:49.230
You were shot. You were
in a coma for over a week.

09:49.274 --> 09:51.580
The doctor said to take it slow.

09:51.624 --> 09:54.975
Come on.
You just got home.

09:55.019 --> 09:58.849
I'm feeling better.
Avery's off to Brown.

09:58.892 --> 10:00.459
Surely I don't have to
take it that slow.

10:00.502 --> 10:03.984
You're bad, and I have
to change for work.

10:04.028 --> 10:07.335
Rain check?
Rain check.

10:11.992 --> 10:15.909
Psst! Patty Cakes!
Hey, keep this on the DL,

10:15.953 --> 10:18.956
but I'm running a little
interoffice pool to predict

10:18.999 --> 10:20.871
who the new FBI Director
is going to be.

10:20.914 --> 10:21.915
They're finally picking someone?

10:21.959 --> 10:23.003
God, it took 'em long enough.

10:23.047 --> 10:24.570
Yeah, well, it's a $50 buy-in.

10:24.613 --> 10:26.441
Favorite gets six-to-one,
or if you're feeling saucy

10:26.485 --> 10:28.182
and want to bet on me,
it's 3,000-to-one,

10:28.226 --> 10:30.968
- so do the math.
- What've we got?

10:31.011 --> 10:33.622
Uh, Roman's dongle is legit.

10:33.666 --> 10:35.015
Love it when you talk dirty.

10:35.059 --> 10:36.495
Since Roman died
three months ago,

10:36.538 --> 10:38.236
we've been able to
track down four of these.

10:38.279 --> 10:40.368
And the bad news is,
there's still eight out there?

10:40.412 --> 10:41.935
No, that's just
a fun fact at this point.

10:41.979 --> 10:43.371
The bad news is that,
once again,

10:43.415 --> 10:45.678
all the files on Roman's
cache are encrypted.

10:45.721 --> 10:47.114
What is with
your family and puzzles?

10:47.158 --> 10:49.334
I'm guessing this cache has
similar intel to the others?

10:49.377 --> 10:51.031
More research
on my ZIP poisoning?

10:51.075 --> 10:52.424
More tattoo ciphers?

10:52.467 --> 10:54.208
Yeah, I think
that's a pretty safe bet.

10:54.252 --> 10:55.818
Okay, well, then,
let's get on decrypting it

10:55.862 --> 10:58.299
so we can find the rest of 'em
and take down HCI Global.

10:58.343 --> 11:01.737
Can we not... I mean,
Hank Crawford is dead, right?

11:01.781 --> 11:03.565
Like, all the way dead?
I mean, what if we just ease back

11:03.609 --> 11:06.394
on the whole HCI Global
fetish and focus on this?

11:06.438 --> 11:08.788
The world's most dangerous
company is still operational.

11:08.831 --> 11:11.704
We have to assume that their plans
for world domination are still a go.

11:11.747 --> 11:13.749
They're like the Hydra.
You cut off one of their heads,

11:13.793 --> 11:15.360
and two more are gonna
grow back in its place.

11:15.403 --> 11:17.188
I know what a Hydra is.
You don't have to clarify

11:17.231 --> 11:18.406
like you're the only one
who knows what a Hydra is.

11:18.450 --> 11:19.886
Rich, Patterson's right.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.409
I'd feel a lot better if we knew

11:21.453 --> 11:24.064
who was taking the wheel
in Crawford's absence.

11:34.248 --> 11:35.989
Penny for your thoughts?

11:36.033 --> 11:38.165
Your position as
Interim CEO is tenuous.

11:38.209 --> 11:40.994
Someone on HCI Global's
board wants you out.

11:41.038 --> 11:42.822
That's what you were
thinking about here at sunset,

11:42.865 --> 11:43.997
on the bank of the Seine?

11:44.041 --> 11:45.172
We need to shore up your support

11:45.216 --> 11:46.434
and call a vote to get you in

11:46.478 --> 11:49.394
permanently as CEO, now.

11:49.437 --> 11:52.353
Protocol dictates I serve for
six months as Interim before...

11:52.397 --> 11:55.269
Would your dad
have followed protocol?

11:55.313 --> 11:57.489
We've set the table
for tomorrow.

11:57.532 --> 11:59.447
All the major shareholders
who don't support you

11:59.491 --> 12:01.101
will be there.

12:01.145 --> 12:04.191
It is time to seduce
the skeptics.

12:04.235 --> 12:07.412
If you don't, someone else will.

12:07.455 --> 12:10.806
I am so glad you're on my side.

12:10.850 --> 12:13.026
Power isn't given.
It's taken.

12:13.070 --> 12:15.507
Tomorrow, we grab it
with both hands.

12:22.514 --> 12:25.299
Sorry I haven't
returned your calls.

12:25.343 --> 12:28.128
I don't want you to worry.
I'm fine.

12:28.172 --> 12:31.131
I just need to go away
for a while...

12:32.654 --> 12:34.874
Sorry to interrupt.

12:34.917 --> 12:36.310
You're fine.

12:36.354 --> 12:39.183
We just cracked a file
on the newest cache.

12:40.619 --> 12:41.924
What is it?

12:41.968 --> 12:43.448
It's not good.

12:43.491 --> 12:45.363
It looks like
Jane's ZIP poisoning

12:45.406 --> 12:48.844
will eventually progress
beyond headaches,

12:48.888 --> 12:51.238
memory lapses, and fainting.

12:53.197 --> 12:54.720
What do you mean?

12:58.724 --> 13:00.030
It's killing you.

13:01.379 --> 13:03.424
The ZIP you were injected with

13:03.468 --> 13:05.600
has never fully left your system.

13:05.644 --> 13:09.169
What remains seems
to be slowly traveling

13:09.213 --> 13:10.649
towards your brain stem.

13:12.303 --> 13:15.349
And the closer it gets,

13:15.393 --> 13:18.135
the worse your symptoms
will become.

13:18.178 --> 13:20.311
And when it arrives there,

13:20.354 --> 13:24.054
your body will effectively
forget how to function,

13:24.097 --> 13:29.015
how to regulate temperature,
heart beats...

13:29.059 --> 13:31.061
how to breathe.

13:32.671 --> 13:34.629
No, Shepherd and Roman

13:34.673 --> 13:37.980
would never have
given me something fatal.

13:38.024 --> 13:40.940
They may not have known
when they dosed you.

13:40.983 --> 13:43.421
But I think Roman found out,

13:43.464 --> 13:45.162
probably because
he was suffering

13:45.205 --> 13:47.338
from the same complications.

13:47.381 --> 13:51.081
This cache contains
theories on cures.

13:51.124 --> 13:54.214
So there are cures? Emphasis on theories.

13:54.258 --> 13:56.695
And you haven't had any
of the advanced symptoms yet.

13:56.738 --> 14:00.046
No voices, no hallucinations.
We have time.

14:00.090 --> 14:03.049
I just...

14:03.093 --> 14:05.356
I need a little space.

14:05.399 --> 14:07.097
Yeah. Why don't
we go home?

14:07.140 --> 14:11.318
Alone.
I need to be alone.

14:15.148 --> 14:17.107
We're gonna do
everything we can.

14:18.195 --> 14:19.761
The other caches might have a...

14:19.805 --> 14:21.415
more definitive treatment.

14:22.503 --> 14:23.548
"Might?"

14:46.527 --> 14:50.357
Hello, sis.
Long time no see.

14:50.401 --> 14:53.447
Roman? But you're...
Dead?

14:53.491 --> 14:56.189
So much for no hallucinations.

14:57.408 --> 15:00.106
I guess you've got
less time than they thought.

15:06.119 --> 15:07.772
So I'm...

15:07.816 --> 15:09.339
Dying.
And you're...

15:09.383 --> 15:11.080
A ZIP-induced hallucination.

15:11.124 --> 15:13.387
A symptom of what's killing you.

15:14.953 --> 15:17.521
Roman, what's happening to me?

15:17.565 --> 15:20.655
I can't remember the last two
and a half years of my life.

15:20.698 --> 15:23.266
The last thing I remember
is Oscar telling me

15:23.310 --> 15:24.833
I would wake up in Times Square.

15:24.876 --> 15:26.791
And then, instead,
I wake up in a hospital bed

15:26.835 --> 15:29.272
only to find that you
and Oscar are both dead

15:29.316 --> 15:31.100
and Shepherd's
in a black site...

15:31.144 --> 15:32.362
And you're married to the enemy,

15:32.406 --> 15:34.321
the man responsible
for all of that pain.

15:34.364 --> 15:36.366
Yeah, and I have
to smile at him.

15:36.410 --> 15:38.455
I have to tell him
how much I love him.

15:38.499 --> 15:40.457
Play the part of Jane,
doting wife.

15:40.501 --> 15:42.633
Sleeping next to him
every night,

15:42.677 --> 15:44.722
taking care of him.

15:44.766 --> 15:46.507
It makes you sick, doesn't it?

15:47.508 --> 15:49.075
Do you think Weller's onto you?

15:49.118 --> 15:51.207
That you're you again?

15:51.251 --> 15:54.254
No. I've maintained
my cover,

15:54.297 --> 15:56.560
and I've been reaching
out to Sandstorm.

15:56.604 --> 16:00.216
Hobbes, it's me,
it's Remi. I need help.

16:00.260 --> 16:03.132
All the old numbers, online
forums, drafts folders...

16:03.176 --> 16:04.568
They beat us, remember?

16:04.612 --> 16:06.483
Do you really think
there's anyone left?

16:06.527 --> 16:08.746
There has to be.

16:08.790 --> 16:11.097
No. There doesn't.

16:11.140 --> 16:13.838
Maybe the time
for fighting is over.

16:13.882 --> 16:16.928
Maybe you and I could just run.

16:16.972 --> 16:19.453
No, no, no, I can't!

16:19.496 --> 16:22.108
Look, you said it
yourself, I'm dying.

16:22.151 --> 16:23.761
I have no choice
but to keep working

16:23.805 --> 16:25.720
with these people
until we recover

16:25.763 --> 16:28.114
the rest of your data
caches and find the cure.

16:28.157 --> 16:30.420
If I want to live,
I have to stay.

16:30.464 --> 16:32.161
You really think that can work?

16:32.205 --> 16:37.166
I mean,
if I had all the answers,

16:37.210 --> 16:39.777
don't you think
I would've cured myself?

16:47.829 --> 16:49.613
What the hell are you doin'?

16:49.657 --> 16:51.224
My physical therapist
said that I could

16:51.267 --> 16:52.660
increase training,
so that's what I'm doing.

16:52.703 --> 16:55.053
And the doctor said
you could bench press?

16:55.097 --> 16:58.492
I gotta get back in the field.

16:58.535 --> 17:00.320
Jane shouldn't be
out there alone.

17:00.363 --> 17:02.713
She's not, she's got us,
and if you rush your recovery,

17:02.757 --> 17:04.150
she won't have you at all.

17:06.281 --> 17:11.113
This ZIP poisoning thing,

17:11.156 --> 17:13.681
I can't imagine
my life without her.

17:21.297 --> 17:23.560
She's gonna put up
one hell of a fight.

17:23.604 --> 17:25.954
You know that.

17:25.997 --> 17:27.651
Yeah.

17:29.262 --> 17:33.353
What about you?
You hanging in there?

17:33.396 --> 17:35.964
Are you talking about Tasha?

17:36.007 --> 17:37.008
Yes, I am.

17:37.052 --> 17:38.358
Oh, I'm fine.

17:39.533 --> 17:40.534
Really?

17:42.797 --> 17:44.668
I've been calling.

17:44.712 --> 17:47.758
She's only called me back
once, about a month ago.

17:47.802 --> 17:51.371
She left a voicemail.
Told me not to worry.

17:52.328 --> 17:55.201
We all miss her.
Yeah.

18:02.295 --> 18:03.687
Patterson's got something...

18:03.731 --> 18:05.036
whoa, on Sandstorm.

18:05.080 --> 18:06.864
Put me back in, coach.

18:06.908 --> 18:09.519
When the doc says you're ready
and not a second before.

18:13.306 --> 18:14.785
Over the past couple months,

18:14.829 --> 18:18.180
I've picked up on
some Sandstorm chatter.

18:18.224 --> 18:20.313
Why are we just
hearing about this?

18:20.356 --> 18:21.618
Well, you're just
hearing about this.

18:21.662 --> 18:23.054
You were taking care of Weller,

18:23.098 --> 18:24.360
and we didn't want to worry you.

18:24.404 --> 18:26.971
Plus, we didn't have
anything concrete, so...

18:27.015 --> 18:29.887
Yeah, all the digital communicado
was super one-sided.

18:29.931 --> 18:32.325
One last true
believer screaming into the void.

18:32.368 --> 18:34.152
It got pretty sad, actually.

18:34.196 --> 18:36.633
"Chef Lonely Hearts Soup for
One," if you know what I mean.

18:36.677 --> 18:39.636
Until today.
Somebody responded.

18:39.680 --> 18:40.724
What did they say?

18:40.768 --> 18:42.944
- It's coded.
- Obviously.

18:42.987 --> 18:45.947
But I'm 99% sure it's
a Wheatstone Playfair cipher.

18:45.990 --> 18:48.602
My computer is running
the frequency analysis now,

18:48.645 --> 18:50.081
trying to ascertain the keyword.

18:50.125 --> 18:52.432
How long does that take?
Half hour, tops.

18:52.475 --> 18:54.085
If we get an address,
we're storming this place.

18:54.129 --> 18:55.261
I'm not taking any chances.

18:55.304 --> 18:57.393
You know what the keyword is.

18:57.437 --> 19:00.309
Hell, you've already
solved it, haven't you?

19:00.353 --> 19:01.789
Someone has finally reached out.

19:01.832 --> 19:04.618
They've set a meet,
and you've got 30 minutes

19:04.661 --> 19:07.185
before they figure out
where it is.

19:07.229 --> 19:10.276
You gotta get out of here now.

19:10.319 --> 19:13.583
Hey, are you okay?

19:13.627 --> 19:15.759
Yeah, it's just a headache.

19:15.803 --> 19:18.936
I'm just gonna
lie down for a bit.

19:42.003 --> 19:43.439
Hello?

19:45.833 --> 19:47.400
Hello?

19:50.359 --> 19:51.360
Well, I'll be damned.

19:51.404 --> 19:53.449
Listen to me, the FBI's coming.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.711
We have to get out of here.

19:54.755 --> 19:56.409
"We" don't have
to do anything, Jane.

19:56.452 --> 19:57.714
I know you work for the Feds

19:57.758 --> 19:59.325
now that you've turned
your back on us.

19:59.368 --> 20:02.023
Never thought I'd get to meet
the traitor face-to-face.

20:05.418 --> 20:06.636
Reade, I have the address.

20:06.680 --> 20:07.681
I'm sending it to you now.

20:07.724 --> 20:09.335
Copy that.

20:13.513 --> 20:15.166
I'm not Jane anymore.

20:15.210 --> 20:18.126
I'm Remi again. I'm me! Uh-huh.

20:18.169 --> 20:20.650
What happened, you get hit in the
head with the second coconut?

20:20.694 --> 20:22.957
Why have you been
trying to contact me?

20:23.000 --> 20:25.394
'Cause I'm on your side. My side?
"Sandstorm," right?

20:25.438 --> 20:27.614
That's what you call us?
Well, there is no side,

20:27.657 --> 20:29.877
'cause I'm the only one
left. You did that!

20:33.184 --> 20:35.099
Like I said,

20:35.143 --> 20:37.363
I'm on your side,

20:37.406 --> 20:38.886
and we just doubled our numbers.

20:38.929 --> 20:40.235
Now, you need to believe me.

20:40.278 --> 20:42.368
The FBI will be here any second.

20:47.982 --> 20:49.331
Why should I trust you?

20:49.375 --> 20:51.507
Because I am telling you
how to get away right now

20:51.551 --> 20:54.118
and because you still
believe we can rebuild.

20:54.162 --> 20:56.077
Please, I have
a place we can talk,

20:56.120 --> 20:57.383
but it's not safe here.

21:00.821 --> 21:02.779
I'm risking
everything to be here.

21:02.823 --> 21:04.912
The second they find us,
we have nothing.

21:04.955 --> 21:06.870
Please. Trust me.

21:17.925 --> 21:19.883
Clear!

21:19.927 --> 21:21.755
We missed 'em.

21:24.758 --> 21:27.064
Thank you all for coming today.

21:27.108 --> 21:29.632
My late father had
a vision for this company,

21:29.676 --> 21:31.199
a vision I share and I...

21:31.242 --> 21:33.114
All due respect,

21:33.157 --> 21:34.681
I'm not sure you're fully aware

21:34.724 --> 21:36.639
of everything this company does.

21:36.683 --> 21:38.380
Apart from your charity work...

21:38.424 --> 21:39.425
George!

21:39.468 --> 21:41.165
The girl just lost her father.

21:41.209 --> 21:44.734
Exactly. She should be
taking the time to grieve,

21:44.778 --> 21:48.390
not learning how to run
a multinational conglomerate.

21:50.000 --> 21:53.743
Thank you, Madeline,
but I don't need defending.

21:53.787 --> 21:56.050
And I certainly don't
need an explanation

21:56.093 --> 21:58.052
of what this company does:

21:58.095 --> 22:00.663
The orphanages,
the training grounds,

22:00.707 --> 22:02.796
my father's plan
for a global army.

22:02.839 --> 22:05.015
I know it all,
and I believe in it.

22:07.017 --> 22:08.976
So, Mr. Amherst,
if you thought I was

22:09.019 --> 22:10.586
just some charity doyenne,
it appears

22:10.630 --> 22:13.197
you're the one
who's not fully aware.

22:13.241 --> 22:16.592
I am prepared to make
your priorities mine.

22:16.636 --> 22:18.202
Now I know this is unorthodox,

22:18.246 --> 22:20.683
but I'm calling a shareholder
meeting this week

22:20.727 --> 22:23.033
to formally vote
on my father's replacement.

22:23.077 --> 22:25.775
I'd like to know that
I can count on your support.

22:27.647 --> 22:31.477
So, how do we get this done?

22:37.178 --> 22:40.486
Thank you...

22:40.529 --> 22:42.270
for before.

22:42.313 --> 22:43.967
But I still have some questions.

22:44.011 --> 22:47.318
I'd be disappointed
if you didn't.

22:47.362 --> 22:48.885
The FBI really doesn't know?

22:48.929 --> 22:51.714
No. They think
I'm Jane Doe now,

22:51.758 --> 22:53.890
true blue, through and through.

22:55.805 --> 22:59.156
You really did it.
You infiltrated...

22:59.200 --> 23:01.637
The FBI. We are right
where we need to be.

23:01.681 --> 23:04.553
About this "we."
We have no money.

23:04.597 --> 23:06.207
We have no resources.

23:06.250 --> 23:08.731
And we are gonna fix that.

23:08.775 --> 23:10.733
We're an army of two.

23:10.777 --> 23:12.996
Everyone else is either
dead or in prison.

23:13.040 --> 23:14.171
So we hire mercenaries.

23:14.215 --> 23:15.433
Mercs aren't cheap.

23:15.477 --> 23:16.652
You have that much
cash lying around?

23:16.696 --> 23:19.525
No. But I think I know
where we can get it.

23:19.568 --> 23:21.657
Oh yeah? How?

23:21.701 --> 23:23.920
We trigger a tattoo.

23:28.403 --> 23:29.752
Thank you, Madeline,

23:29.796 --> 23:31.928
but this was really unnecessary.

23:31.972 --> 23:35.105
Please, don't people know how
to celebrate properly anymore?

23:35.149 --> 23:40.850
Now, to the future CEO
of HCI Global,

23:40.894 --> 23:45.028
a woman who knows
exactly what she wants.

23:52.470 --> 23:54.037
My father believed
that this company

23:54.081 --> 23:56.300
had the power
to change the world,

23:56.344 --> 23:58.302
and I intend to see
that it does.

23:58.346 --> 24:02.350
The road that lies ahead will
not always be easy or popular.

24:02.393 --> 24:04.091
True change is often painful.

24:04.134 --> 24:07.529
It requires risk.
Sacrifice.

24:07.573 --> 24:08.574
May we all have the courage to...

24:08.617 --> 24:10.576
Christine? Ms. Salem?

24:15.798 --> 24:17.365
What... What did you...?

24:19.193 --> 24:20.977
What did you give them?

24:21.021 --> 24:23.066
Should that really be
your main concern right now?

24:23.110 --> 24:24.241
Drop your weapon.

24:25.634 --> 24:28.332
Why... why...

24:28.376 --> 24:30.117
Why are you doing this?

24:30.160 --> 24:32.598
You literally don't have
time for me to explain.

24:32.641 --> 24:36.427
Goodbye, Blake.
Say hi to your dad.

24:41.519 --> 24:46.263
Now, what to do about you?

24:52.850 --> 24:55.497
I can be useful.
I'm former FBI.

24:55.540 --> 24:58.848
And CIA and NYPD.

24:58.891 --> 25:02.025
I know everything about you.

25:02.068 --> 25:05.158
You've always been
part of my plan, Tasha.

25:05.202 --> 25:06.682
What plan?

25:06.725 --> 25:09.946
We play by my rules,
not yours. Understand?

25:09.989 --> 25:11.774
And if this little
corporate takeover

25:11.817 --> 25:14.341
is giving you pause,
you tell me right now,

25:14.385 --> 25:15.821
and we'll end it right here.

25:18.650 --> 25:20.739
Blake has always been too timid,

25:20.783 --> 25:23.699
but that's not your problem.

25:23.742 --> 25:26.789
No?
What is my problem?

25:32.011 --> 25:34.492
How do you plan
to explain all this?

25:34.536 --> 25:35.972
I have a story.

25:36.015 --> 25:39.236
We're never together,
not as a group.

25:39.279 --> 25:40.933
But here we are,

25:40.977 --> 25:43.414
so now we all
go off to Saint-Tropez

25:43.457 --> 25:44.807
for a little corporate retreat,

25:44.850 --> 25:48.375
and sadly, my yacht
will sink off the coast

25:48.419 --> 25:50.203
during the festivities,
and you and I

25:50.247 --> 25:51.553
will be the only survivors.

25:51.596 --> 25:54.730
Your yacht? And you
think that's smart?

25:54.773 --> 25:56.209
Do you have a better idea?

25:56.253 --> 25:58.864
A cover story that actually
covers your tracks.

25:58.908 --> 26:00.997
They all flew in
on Blake's plane.

26:01.040 --> 26:04.130
Why not fly them out
on it too? It crashes.

26:04.174 --> 26:06.219
There's enough DNA in
the ashes to make an ID,

26:06.263 --> 26:08.700
but not enough to find whatever
you put in that champagne.

26:08.744 --> 26:12.791
You see?
Useful already.

26:12.835 --> 26:17.535
And put me on the manifest too.

26:17.579 --> 26:19.145
My remains will burn
in the crash.

26:19.189 --> 26:20.886
I'll be just
another missing body,

26:20.930 --> 26:23.585
so when the FBI comes
looking for me,

26:23.628 --> 26:25.978
there'll be nothing to find.

26:30.461 --> 26:32.202
So, this is weird.

26:32.245 --> 26:34.639
We got a hit
on an original tattoo.

26:34.683 --> 26:37.076
Yo mean one of the old ones?

26:37.120 --> 26:38.687
We have no money.

26:38.730 --> 26:40.166
But I think I know
where we can get it.

26:40.210 --> 26:41.907
We trigger a tattoo.

26:41.951 --> 26:43.822
I thought we solved
most of those already.

26:43.866 --> 26:46.433
We did. And most of them
are dried up now.

26:46.477 --> 26:48.218
The cases, not
the literal tattoos.

26:48.261 --> 26:50.263
Obviously, you have
radiant, milky skin, Jane.

26:50.307 --> 26:52.570
Are you a sheet mask girl
or is it more serum...?

26:52.614 --> 26:54.616
So, which tattoo is it?

26:54.659 --> 26:55.747
The "Zhe."

26:55.791 --> 26:57.531
"Zhe," a Cyrillic letter.

26:57.575 --> 27:00.665
It's also the symbol for a
notorious underground bank.

27:00.709 --> 27:02.275
This place operates on US soil,

27:02.319 --> 27:04.277
issuing loans
to the likes of ISIS,

27:04.321 --> 27:05.452
laundering money for gangs.

27:05.496 --> 27:07.019
It's basically
WaMu for bad guys.

27:07.063 --> 27:09.108
And they keep millions
in their vaults.

27:09.152 --> 27:10.675
This place is gonna be
like Fort Knox.

27:10.719 --> 27:11.850
No way the two of us can rob it.

27:11.894 --> 27:14.070
So we don't.
We let the team do it.

27:14.113 --> 27:15.767
We've always
known this bank existed.

27:15.811 --> 27:16.942
We just couldn't find it.

27:16.986 --> 27:18.640
Well, we just did.

27:18.683 --> 27:20.250
Someone on MS-13
slipped up real bad.

27:20.293 --> 27:21.381
Posted on a message board

27:21.425 --> 27:23.122
that they want
to make a withdrawal.

27:23.166 --> 27:26.604
I remember that one.
I know how to unlock it.

27:26.648 --> 27:29.302
Long story short,
the coded language they used

27:29.346 --> 27:32.262
triggered my database,
unlocking the tattoo.

27:32.305 --> 27:34.656
You got a location? Coordinates, yeah.

27:34.699 --> 27:37.180
Then what are we
waiting for? Let's move.

27:45.797 --> 27:49.322
You don't have to do this
if you don't feel up for it.

27:49.366 --> 27:50.846
Yes, I do.

27:50.889 --> 27:53.065
We can't ignore this, Jane.

27:53.109 --> 27:54.850
You're sick.

27:54.893 --> 27:57.504
Look, please,
just take some time off,

27:57.548 --> 27:59.332
slow down a little bit. Oh, yeah?

27:59.376 --> 28:00.856
You're in workout gear, Kurt,

28:00.899 --> 28:03.685
when you're supposed
to be resting.

28:05.338 --> 28:08.211
I'm... I'm fine, really.

28:08.254 --> 28:11.344
But you don't have to be.
It's okay to be scared.

28:11.388 --> 28:13.259
I'm not.
Well, I am.

28:18.395 --> 28:19.701
I know.

28:23.617 --> 28:26.708
We're gonna get
through this, okay?

28:29.058 --> 28:30.450
I love you.

28:30.494 --> 28:32.278
I love you too.

28:35.760 --> 28:37.719
He's gonna be a problem.

28:44.116 --> 28:45.770
All right, you and I'll
command Alpha Team,

28:45.814 --> 28:46.989
breach the front.

28:47.032 --> 28:48.773
No. Why don't you
lead Alpha solo?

28:48.817 --> 28:50.557
Let me take Bravo,
cover the back.

28:50.601 --> 28:52.211
That'll work.

28:57.042 --> 28:59.044
Alpha Team's in position.

29:00.263 --> 29:02.961
Bravo's in place.
Just say the word.

29:03.005 --> 29:05.007
All right, let's do this.

29:20.979 --> 29:23.939
I got this guy!
Move in, clear the floor!

29:28.813 --> 29:30.989
The vault. Now.

29:39.781 --> 29:41.434
Open it.

29:42.871 --> 29:46.439
You wanna live?
Open it.

30:18.950 --> 30:21.170
You don't have to do this.

30:31.658 --> 30:32.746
Jane, what's your 20?

30:32.790 --> 30:34.748
I got into the vault.

30:34.792 --> 30:36.838
You're gonna want to see this.

30:43.235 --> 30:45.194
He tried to go for my gun.

30:46.935 --> 30:49.720
There's gotta be,
like, 200 mil here.

30:49.763 --> 30:52.027
Yeah, give or take.

30:54.102 --> 30:56.364
We recovered over $200 million

30:56.408 --> 30:58.497
from that underground bank,
all large bills.

30:58.540 --> 30:59.759
Racks on racks on racks.

30:59.802 --> 31:00.847
Which is a red flag.

31:00.890 --> 31:02.283
Gangs and terrorist
organizations

31:02.327 --> 31:04.242
raise funds through
drug deals or...

31:04.285 --> 31:07.201
Illegal gambling rings,
brothels, the fun stuff!

31:07.245 --> 31:09.247
Business conducted
in small bills.

31:09.290 --> 31:10.726
You think they're
working with someone else?

31:10.770 --> 31:12.424
Yeah. A legitimate bank,
probably.

31:12.467 --> 31:15.340
But that does track with
the MO of Jane's old tattoos.

31:15.383 --> 31:16.689
Uncovering government corruption

31:16.732 --> 31:18.908
and shady corporations,
it kind of makes sense.

31:18.952 --> 31:20.649
Friends! Colleagues!

31:20.693 --> 31:22.608
Weitz? What are you
doing here?

31:22.651 --> 31:25.263
Uh, whoa, did you
just say colleagues?

31:25.306 --> 31:26.960
Oh, yeah, you haven't heard?

31:27.003 --> 31:28.875
They just named
the new Director of the FBI,

31:28.918 --> 31:30.442
and it's me.

31:30.485 --> 31:32.922
Damn it. Sorry, I...
We had a...

31:32.966 --> 31:35.316
Uh, I'm Richard, by the way.

31:35.360 --> 31:37.362
Congrats.

31:37.405 --> 31:38.754
We're gonna have to work
on your enthusiasm

31:38.798 --> 31:40.887
a little bit, I think.
So, I heard you guys

31:40.930 --> 31:43.585
just raided a shady bank.
Who wants to catch me up?

31:44.717 --> 31:45.892
Uh, I'll go.

31:45.935 --> 31:47.328
Uh, we think they
have connections

31:47.372 --> 31:48.938
to a legitimate
banking institution.

31:48.982 --> 31:50.070
Incorrect!

31:50.113 --> 31:51.114
How do you know that?

31:51.158 --> 31:52.333
Oh, I don't,

31:52.377 --> 31:53.682
but I do know that I don't wanna

31:53.726 --> 31:55.945
crush the US economy
on my first day, so...

31:55.989 --> 32:00.254
Okay, I've got other hands
to shake, so excuse me.

32:02.517 --> 32:04.040
Cool boss.
I hate that guy.

32:04.084 --> 32:06.826
Oh, come on, you're just
bitter that you lost the pool.

32:06.869 --> 32:09.872
You bought into his pool?
It builds office rapport!

32:09.916 --> 32:11.787
Okay.

32:19.839 --> 32:22.581
Hey, can we talk?

32:22.624 --> 32:25.453
I... I found this center
in Mumbai that treats...

32:25.497 --> 32:27.368
Look, I know that
you're frightened.

32:27.412 --> 32:28.804
Honestly, so am I.

32:28.848 --> 32:31.372
My illness, it...
It affects both of us.

32:31.416 --> 32:35.028
I know that, even if
I haven't shown it.

32:36.812 --> 32:38.901
I just want to be there for you.

32:38.945 --> 32:40.990
I want you to let me... If you want to
support me right now,

32:41.034 --> 32:43.863
then trust me.
If something's wrong,

32:43.906 --> 32:46.431
you will be the first
person I come to.

32:46.474 --> 32:50.260
Look, you can't keep
watching me all the time.

32:50.304 --> 32:53.699
It just makes me feel
sicker, like you're waiting

32:53.742 --> 32:56.179
for something
terrible to happen.

32:56.223 --> 33:01.359
You're right.
No more hovering.

33:01.402 --> 33:03.361
Thank you.

33:06.102 --> 33:07.495
Oh! Ow!

33:07.539 --> 33:08.757
Ow!
Oh, sorry.

33:08.801 --> 33:11.194
I forgot you're
still recovering.

33:11.238 --> 33:13.066
Sometimes love hurts.

33:14.241 --> 33:16.548
Well played.

33:21.248 --> 33:24.904
We just got an ID
on our last man "sanding."

33:24.947 --> 33:26.862
That's a Sandstorm pun
I just came up with.

33:26.906 --> 33:28.298
Meet Dolan Osmond.

33:28.342 --> 33:29.561
This genius was smart enough

33:29.604 --> 33:31.867
to bring his cell phone
to that meet.

33:31.911 --> 33:33.129
So he was there this morning?

33:33.173 --> 33:34.479
Briefly, but you must have

33:34.522 --> 33:35.741
spooked him when you arrived.

33:35.784 --> 33:38.526
Sorry, how do you know it's him?

33:38.570 --> 33:40.398
Because Miss Mensa over here
tracked every cell ping

33:40.441 --> 33:41.573
near the warehouse.

33:41.616 --> 33:43.139
Thankfully, it was
a remote meet spot.

33:43.183 --> 33:45.446
Hey, don't downplay it.
It was very impressive.

33:45.490 --> 33:48.188
Anyway, when I
cross-referenced all the pings

33:48.231 --> 33:51.365
with criminal records
and social media profiles...

33:51.409 --> 33:53.106
What, you found
this guy on Instagram?

33:53.149 --> 33:54.542
Opposite, opposite.

33:54.586 --> 33:57.371
Dolan was the only ping
with multiple arrests,

33:57.415 --> 33:59.242
all for anti-government stuff.

33:59.286 --> 34:00.548
That fits the Sandstorm profile.

34:00.592 --> 34:04.073
And the only one
on zero social media sites.

34:04.117 --> 34:06.554
Don't tell me he still
has his cell phone on him?

34:06.598 --> 34:08.426
He's on the West Side Highway.

34:08.469 --> 34:09.775
All right, let's do it.

34:09.818 --> 34:11.907
Well, you've got no way
of contacting him.

34:11.951 --> 34:13.996
Good luck getting
out of this one.

34:16.563 --> 34:18.348
You have to get to him first.

34:18.391 --> 34:19.654
You think I don't know that?

34:20.612 --> 34:22.440
I've got eyes on the target.

34:38.020 --> 34:40.370
You need to get rid
of Reade right now

34:40.414 --> 34:42.938
or your only ally gets
taken off the board.

34:59.041 --> 35:00.869
Jane, what the hell was that?!

35:00.913 --> 35:02.741
Sorry, that car came
out of nowhere!

35:02.784 --> 35:04.656
I've still got eyes
on the target.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.487
You know, I've got an idea.

35:15.101 --> 35:16.102
I've got him!

35:46.306 --> 35:48.482
Dolan!

35:49.831 --> 35:51.050
Dolan, come on, we gotta
get you to a hospital.

35:51.093 --> 35:52.530
No, you don't.

35:52.573 --> 35:54.488
Please, Dolan, hang on.

35:54.532 --> 35:58.187
Make them pay, Remi.
Promise me.

35:58.231 --> 36:00.712
Make them pay for all of it.

36:02.148 --> 36:04.019
Dolan.

36:15.955 --> 36:19.263
So, Dolan's death
is a bit of a setback.

36:19.307 --> 36:20.873
Why? With Dolan dead,

36:20.917 --> 36:23.311
Sandstorm's really
finished now. We won.

36:23.354 --> 36:24.616
No. He was communicating
with someone.

36:24.660 --> 36:27.358
Yeah, and it's on us
to find out who.

36:27.402 --> 36:28.403
What about his cell phone?

36:28.446 --> 36:29.578
Maybe he used it to reach out.

36:29.621 --> 36:32.145
Burner. Called 411 once.
That's it.

36:32.189 --> 36:33.625
It's gonna be a
little harder to track down

36:33.669 --> 36:34.974
the mystery Sandstormer now.

36:35.018 --> 36:38.630
Hard, but it's not impossible.
Whoever this is,

36:38.674 --> 36:40.937
they just became
our Most Wanted.

36:46.029 --> 36:48.814
Ooh, nice work.

36:48.858 --> 36:51.164
Maybe I should
fire my maid as well.

36:54.429 --> 36:55.821
What is it?

36:57.736 --> 37:01.349
This has been a monumental day
for us here in the Bureau.

37:01.392 --> 37:04.526
Under my direction,
this office has taken down

37:04.569 --> 37:06.919
an underground bank
responsible for funding

37:06.963 --> 37:09.748
street gangs
and terrorist groups.

37:09.792 --> 37:13.970
Today, my first day
as FBI Director,

37:14.013 --> 37:16.581
we saved thousands of lives.

37:16.625 --> 37:17.974
I'll briefly take
a few questions.

37:18.017 --> 37:20.411
This new FBI Director
will be good for us.

37:20.455 --> 37:22.370
Weitz is malleable.

37:22.413 --> 37:24.633
But you know all
about that, don't you?

37:26.461 --> 37:28.245
What about your relationship

37:28.288 --> 37:29.855
with Assistant Director Reade?

37:30.856 --> 37:34.556
We were colleagues.
That's it.

37:34.599 --> 37:36.819
I know that look.

37:38.429 --> 37:40.475
Could you kill your colleague

37:40.518 --> 37:41.954
if you had to?

37:44.043 --> 37:46.785
Without question.

37:50.572 --> 37:53.444
Hey, Kurt.
Yeah?

37:53.488 --> 37:55.881
We have more bad news.

37:55.925 --> 37:58.231
We dug into Roman's mystery calls.
He was calling

37:58.275 --> 38:00.059
the same number again and
again before he died.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.018
We thought it might be a
lead, maybe a scientist

38:02.061 --> 38:04.324
he was working with
to cure this illness.

38:04.368 --> 38:07.937
And what'd you find?
Who was he talking to?

38:07.980 --> 38:09.242
Nobody.

38:09.286 --> 38:11.288
We traced it to a VOIP landline

38:11.331 --> 38:13.029
that's been out of
service for over a year.

38:13.072 --> 38:14.552
That doesn't make sense.

38:14.596 --> 38:17.729
We think he thought he
was speaking with someone,

38:17.773 --> 38:19.731
that he was experiencing
hallucinations

38:19.775 --> 38:21.429
from his ZIP poisoning.

38:22.430 --> 38:24.344
Like Jane will, eventually.

38:24.388 --> 38:27.609
Uh...
Yeah... yeah.

38:27.652 --> 38:32.701
I'm... I've gotta go home
and check on my wife.

38:37.488 --> 38:39.708
What? Oh, don't look
at me like that.

38:39.751 --> 38:41.449
That's not a cure.
That's a fairy tale.

38:41.492 --> 38:42.754
Oh, come on, now that we know

38:42.798 --> 38:44.364
how lethal Jane's
ZIP poisoning is,

38:44.408 --> 38:46.454
isn't this is the perfect
time to read everybody in

38:46.497 --> 38:48.847
on The Book Of Secrets
from Roman's data cache?

38:48.891 --> 38:50.153
I don't want to go
over this again.

38:50.196 --> 38:51.763
Telling Kurt that
book could save Jane's life

38:51.807 --> 38:53.896
is tantamount to telling him
that Santa Claus could.

38:53.939 --> 38:55.724
Okay, I don't think
there's any need

38:55.767 --> 38:57.290
to take shots at Santa,
all right?

38:57.334 --> 38:58.944
What would it hurt?
We'll just take a quick look.

38:58.988 --> 39:00.729
Oh, you want to take a quick
look for the holy grail?

39:00.772 --> 39:01.904
Or the fountain of youth?

39:01.947 --> 39:03.471
If Roman was pointing me to it

39:03.514 --> 39:05.298
from beyond the grave,
yes, yes, I would.

39:05.342 --> 39:08.476
Let it go, seriously.

39:08.519 --> 39:10.478
This isn't gonna help anyone.

39:11.566 --> 39:13.959
Okay.
All right.

39:14.003 --> 39:15.483
Done.

39:16.353 --> 39:18.877
Consider it gone.

39:22.838 --> 39:26.798
Hey. How you feeling?

39:26.842 --> 39:30.933
Uh... A little banged up,
but I'll be all right.

39:30.976 --> 39:35.546
'Cause you seem
a little distracted.

39:35.590 --> 39:38.157
Me? What about Jane?
She came out of nowhere!

39:38.201 --> 39:40.725
This news about her health,
Weller's recovery...

39:40.769 --> 39:42.248
she's going through it.

39:42.292 --> 39:45.034
You're going through
a lot right now, too.

39:46.383 --> 39:47.515
I heard you listening

39:47.558 --> 39:49.517
to Tasha's voicemail
this morning.

39:50.692 --> 39:53.433
That was an old message.
It's...

39:53.477 --> 39:55.740
You're allowed to miss her.

39:58.003 --> 40:00.702
I just wish
I knew where she was.

40:03.531 --> 40:05.750
She's in Zurich.

40:05.794 --> 40:08.100
I didn't want to say anything
until I knew for sure,

40:08.144 --> 40:11.234
but the chime on the message,

40:11.277 --> 40:12.844
it sounded familiar.

40:12.888 --> 40:15.194
Sorry I haven't
returned your calls.

40:15.238 --> 40:17.240
I don't want you to worry.
I'm fine.

40:17.283 --> 40:20.025
I just need to go away
for a while.

40:21.200 --> 40:22.593
So I did a little digging,

40:22.637 --> 40:25.988
and it's the sound
their trams make.

40:26.031 --> 40:30.253
That's where she is...
or at least where she was.

40:31.384 --> 40:33.212
It's a start.

40:35.867 --> 40:36.912
I never thought that, uh...

40:36.955 --> 40:38.435
I never thought
that this would...

40:38.478 --> 40:40.437
this would happen for me...
happen for me.

40:40.480 --> 40:42.221
I never thought that...
I never thought that...

40:42.265 --> 40:45.790
I would find what we have.
I would find what we have.

40:45.834 --> 40:47.879
Today is just...

40:47.923 --> 40:52.884
Uh, hey. Sorry,
I didn't hear you.

40:57.280 --> 40:59.456
What were you doing?

40:59.499 --> 41:03.068
Uh, I just...

41:04.635 --> 41:09.292
There's so many memories
that I've lost already.

41:10.685 --> 41:13.296
I didn't want
to lose this one too.

41:13.339 --> 41:16.734
You won't.
I won't let you.

41:18.736 --> 41:21.347
So, what about Roman's calls?

41:21.391 --> 41:24.263
Did Patterson have
any luck tracing them?

41:26.309 --> 41:27.876
No. Not yet.

41:28.920 --> 41:30.966
How about I go
and get us some dinner?

41:31.009 --> 41:32.445
Vegan banh mi?

41:32.489 --> 41:34.099
That sounds perfect.

41:34.143 --> 41:36.275
You got it.

41:42.281 --> 41:45.720
Nice cover for your little
"Jane Doe rehearsal."

41:45.763 --> 41:47.765
I hate him.
I know.

41:47.809 --> 41:51.160
I want revenge for everything.

41:51.203 --> 41:54.511
For you, Oscar,
Dolan, our mother...

41:54.554 --> 41:56.121
So take it.

41:56.165 --> 41:59.037
We are gonna break our mother
out of that black site,

41:59.081 --> 42:02.127
we are gonna
find a cure for you,

42:02.171 --> 42:04.564
and then...

42:04.608 --> 42:07.350
we're gonna kill Kurt Weller.

42:43.212 --> 42:44.909
Greg, move your head!
