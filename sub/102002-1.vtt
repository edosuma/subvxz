WEBVTT

01:04.239 --> 01:06.808
Ugh. Ugh.
Ahhhhhh!

01:20.822 --> 01:23.491
Thank God that's over with.

01:24.961 --> 01:28.364
I want you to take my body.

01:28.496 --> 01:29.597
You want me to do what!?

01:29.731 --> 01:32.234
It'll be fun... trust me.

01:32.368 --> 01:35.870
Ummm...

01:36.005 --> 01:39.507
Keep fishin'
Brit, this one is mine -

01:39.641 --> 01:41.944
Sometimes.

01:42.078 --> 01:43.145
This time!

01:43.279 --> 01:46.182
Ok! I got the message - I'll
catch you later.

01:46.315 --> 01:48.483
You too sexy fish.

01:50.386 --> 01:51.686
She...

01:51.820 --> 01:56.926
I know. Just
remember who you really want.

02:14.110 --> 02:15.311
There she is.

02:15.444 --> 02:17.679
Yeah I see her!

02:17.812 --> 02:21.549
Avery Quinn!
Stop right where you are!

02:22.118 --> 02:24.020
Oh God...

02:24.519 --> 02:25.988
Avery!...

02:27.189 --> 02:31.559
We've got eye on her... she's
on foot..and she's armed...

02:33.628 --> 02:34.796
Come on.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.531
You ain't gotta tell me twice.

02:36.664 --> 02:39.768
Well, I doubt you can do twice
but I'll take what I can get.

02:40.835 --> 02:44.373
Does she have to try to
nail everything that moves?

02:44.507 --> 02:47.143
- What!?
- Nothing! Let's go.

02:51.180 --> 02:52.314
Oh boy...

02:53.449 --> 02:57.286
Oh, no, no, no
loverboy... its time to go-

02:57.420 --> 02:58.620
party is over...

02:58.753 --> 03:00.189
Come on Gwyn!
We'll let you join in if

03:00.322 --> 03:01.589
you'd like.

03:01.723 --> 03:02.690
You can't handle me!

03:02.824 --> 03:04.026
Let's go!

03:05.094 --> 03:06.262
I better go too.

03:06.529 --> 03:09.098
You don't have to be good
all of the time you know.

03:09.597 --> 03:10.966
Your dad hates
me enough already.

03:11.100 --> 03:14.303
Stop worrying
about what people think!

03:14.437 --> 03:15.538
That's easy for you to say.

03:15.670 --> 03:17.872
Just go - with your boyfriend!

03:30.186 --> 03:31.954
Help!

03:34.056 --> 03:38.994
Somebody please... help me...

03:39.128 --> 03:40.829
help...

03:41.596 --> 03:44.599
help me... help me...

03:44.732 --> 03:46.135
What the hell!?

03:46.402 --> 03:49.038
Somebody get locked out and
shit themselves or what?....

03:51.739 --> 03:53.842
You sure can pick 'em ladies...

03:54.543 --> 03:58.713
Standards, ladies. Standards.

04:00.950 --> 04:05.287
Let me in! Please!

04:09.225 --> 04:11.227
I think its some girl out there
in her underwear but I can't

04:11.360 --> 04:13.795
- really tell.
- Well goddamn! I say let that

04:13.929 --> 04:15.431
- bitch in!
- Shut up, man. She might be

04:15.564 --> 04:16.565
- hurt.
- Maybe we should

04:16.697 --> 04:18.067
call the police first?

04:18.200 --> 04:21.702
Police!? For a girl with her
wail-tail flying?

04:21.937 --> 04:25.773
You don't need cops baby,
you need Carter Reese.

04:29.578 --> 04:32.214
What if she left here earlier
and got in trouble?

04:32.348 --> 04:35.050
That wouldn't be too good for Pi
house, would it Gwyn?

04:35.184 --> 04:38.420
Nobody is calling anyone.
Pi house will be fine.

04:38.554 --> 04:40.589
I'll handle this.

04:40.722 --> 04:43.025
One way or another...

04:44.826 --> 04:46.728
Help!

04:54.003 --> 04:55.870
See! What did I tell you!?

04:56.172 --> 04:58.873
When girls come to Carter
Reese their pants just fall off!

05:00.276 --> 05:01.177
Hey.

05:01.809 --> 05:03.245
Let me help you baby.

05:04.547 --> 05:06.916
Oh shit!

05:11.987 --> 05:13.455
Close the door!

05:14.190 --> 05:15.723
Now!

05:17.560 --> 05:18.826
Ok...

05:29.305 --> 05:30.439
Lock it!

05:31.473 --> 05:32.707
Hurry up!

05:33.075 --> 05:35.511
I said lock the
fucking door!

05:35.843 --> 05:37.279
Now!

05:38.414 --> 05:42.585
And get over there before I blow
his goddamn head off!

05:42.717 --> 05:44.719
Want me to hold
my hands up forever?

05:45.753 --> 05:48.924
You'll do whatever I say.
Got it?

05:49.525 --> 05:51.160
Fuck you!

05:51.293 --> 05:52.860
Fuck me?!

05:52.995 --> 05:54.496
Fuck you!

05:55.763 --> 05:58.100
Understand me now? There are
far worse things that can happen

05:58.234 --> 06:02.171
to you than your arms
getting tired. Trust me.

06:02.571 --> 06:03.606
Now go!

06:04.806 --> 06:08.944
Everyone into the living room
where I can see you. Now!

06:16.919 --> 06:19.355
What do you want?

06:21.290 --> 06:26.495
What do I want?
What do I want?

06:29.898 --> 06:31.900
That's a good question

06:33.068 --> 06:35.803
So many things.

06:39.508 --> 06:41.809
I don't know.

06:45.547 --> 06:48.417
How about my last two
days back for starters?

06:50.486 --> 06:52.688
A good pair of running
shoes and comfortable pants

06:52.820 --> 06:56.225
wouldn't hurt either.

06:58.193 --> 06:59.361
But I -

06:59.495 --> 07:01.063
What do I really want?

07:01.597 --> 07:03.032
What do I want?

07:03.165 --> 07:06.235
That's what you want
to know!? Is it!?

07:10.838 --> 07:12.074
Pi House.

07:12.675 --> 07:15.044
You think these girls have
actually seen anything?

07:16.378 --> 07:19.248
It's the last night
before Spring Break

07:20.616 --> 07:22.184
This party is legendary.

07:23.485 --> 07:25.988
The price of admission is
enough to say the least.

07:26.722 --> 07:28.991
Well, I wouldn't let
Sharon find out how you know about

07:29.124 --> 07:31.694
legendary Last Night.

07:32.661 --> 07:35.197
Can't imagine your dad would be
too thrilled about it either.

07:38.866 --> 07:40.235
What do I want?

07:41.603 --> 07:43.005
What do I want?

07:47.443 --> 07:52.847
I want my friends back.
I just want my Eric back.

07:56.318 --> 07:58.153
I just want them back.

07:59.722 --> 08:01.323
I just want them back.

08:04.159 --> 08:06.095
I can't believe he's real.

08:07.963 --> 08:10.265
Why did we have to do it!

08:13.936 --> 08:16.871
If we would have never
done it, they'd still be here.

08:24.680 --> 08:26.382
Here.

08:26.515 --> 08:27.649
Let me help you.

08:27.783 --> 08:29.051
Help me!?

08:29.651 --> 08:31.453
How are you
gonna help me Gwyn!?

08:33.822 --> 08:36.725
You know Dylan, I've been called
multiple times to this estate

08:36.859 --> 08:37.993
for noise complaints.

08:38.126 --> 08:39.695
Yeah Miller,
we're all aware of your

08:39.828 --> 08:42.063
enthusiasm when it comes to
catching the noise complaint

08:42.197 --> 08:44.032
cases at the Pi House.

08:45.134 --> 08:46.835
A word to the wise -

08:47.069 --> 08:48.370
women always find out.

08:49.338 --> 08:51.006
Always.

08:51.140 --> 08:52.441
Don't forget that big guy.

08:53.642 --> 08:56.712
Oh, that's right, I know who
you are you stuck up bitch.

08:57.045 --> 08:59.581
if you're stupid morning show
wasn't enough, your picture's

08:59.715 --> 09:01.917
all over the place at GMU.

09:02.785 --> 09:05.387
How much did that
cost you anyway huh?

09:05.854 --> 09:08.924
Must be nice to buy your
way out of everything.

09:09.191 --> 09:11.794
If I can't do it,
I'll just buy it.

09:11.960 --> 09:15.464
Just rich bitch Malibu
Barbie living the American dream

09:15.597 --> 09:17.166
aren't ya!?

09:19.768 --> 09:21.670
You really think
she'd crash this party?

09:22.070 --> 09:23.305
I mean.

09:24.406 --> 09:25.909
Too many witnesses
right - it doesn't make sense -

09:26.041 --> 09:27.543
No it doesn't make any sense.

09:28.310 --> 09:30.212
but if anything
strange is going on,

09:30.345 --> 09:31.680
Gwyn will know about it -

09:32.815 --> 09:34.550
nothing happens at GMU without
Gwyn knowing about it.

09:35.818 --> 09:38.487
Besides, Olivia said she came
this way so it's worth a shot.

09:40.489 --> 09:43.759
But enough of this
getting to know you bullshit,

09:43.893 --> 09:45.427
let's keep it simple.

09:45.994 --> 09:50.265
- I didn't...
- Ah, why so sensitive anyway Gwyn!?

09:50.399 --> 09:53.602
Did I hit a nerve?
I don't wanna hear it!

09:56.338 --> 09:59.041
You can't buy
your way out of this one.

10:00.142 --> 10:03.880
You can't help me.
None of you can.

10:04.012 --> 10:05.714
Then what do you want?

10:06.782 --> 10:08.350
Just go.

10:08.784 --> 10:10.052
- Dylan?
- Hmm?

10:10.619 --> 10:12.521
How do you know
about the Pi parties.

10:17.226 --> 10:20.996
Experience buddy boy.
Experience.

10:21.563 --> 10:23.131
Wow.

10:24.833 --> 10:27.035
Do not fucking move!

10:29.538 --> 10:31.039
Come on ladies.

10:31.173 --> 10:32.441
Ms. Prescott!?

10:33.675 --> 10:36.044
Ms. Prescott, its Sheriff Dylan
and Officer Miller from Lake

10:36.178 --> 10:37.513
Hartwell PD.

10:39.281 --> 10:41.283
Alright, get rid of them -

10:41.683 --> 10:42.618
You go, too!

10:43.887 --> 10:47.322
And if anyone of you thinks
about signaling them or calling

10:47.456 --> 10:50.960
out or even breathing
too fucking loudly I'll empty

10:51.093 --> 10:54.730
every fucking bullet into them,
take their guns, and shoot you

10:54.863 --> 10:56.298
all in the fucking head!

10:57.332 --> 10:58.567
You get me?

10:59.801 --> 11:01.905
Come on, ladies.

11:02.037 --> 11:03.338
Jesus Christ.

11:04.573 --> 11:05.942
Come on, ladies!

11:06.575 --> 11:08.277
Ma'am we're looking for
a fugitive in the area, can you

11:08.410 --> 11:09.946
open the door please?

11:12.414 --> 11:13.415
You want me to knock?

11:13.549 --> 11:14.516
Shut up.

11:14.650 --> 11:16.920
Let's go!

11:17.185 --> 11:18.720
Come on!

11:18.854 --> 11:20.522
Ms. Prescott!?

11:21.590 --> 11:22.926
Tada!

11:23.058 --> 11:24.560
- Good evening, Ms. Prescott.
- Good evening officers what can

11:24.693 --> 11:26.461
- I do ya for?
- Ma'am not to alarm you, we're

11:26.595 --> 11:29.665
looking for a suspect in the
area. Have you seen this woman?

11:29.966 --> 11:33.335
Uh, no I haven't
Lucas, what has she done?

11:33.702 --> 11:36.973
It's possible she may have
murdered five people at the old

11:37.105 --> 11:39.775
Granville house, you know, in
the woods off highway 41.

11:39.909 --> 11:42.979
- You okay?
- Yeah..yeah she's fine we're

11:43.111 --> 11:44.546
just, uh - that's shocking.

11:44.680 --> 11:47.749
Yeah it sure is.
It's strange too.

11:47.884 --> 11:49.318
By all accounts she was...

11:49.851 --> 11:51.587
she was a good girl.

11:51.921 --> 11:54.623
Guess you can't really tell
anymore these days with the damn

11:54.756 --> 11:57.626
reality TV, horror movies,
sexting, and the uppers and

11:57.759 --> 11:59.461
downers they gotta
take to deal with it.

11:59.595 --> 12:01.096
You know its a miracle
we don't hear more often about

12:01.229 --> 12:03.699
some of our own just going snap,
crackle and pop off the goddamn

12:03.832 --> 12:06.134
- reservation.
- Sheriff! Sheriff!

12:06.268 --> 12:07.937
Sorry, sorry ma'am...

12:08.071 --> 12:09.338
Miss, have another look.

12:09.973 --> 12:10.872
A little harder.

12:11.908 --> 12:14.109
Jesus Christ, she's here!

12:14.242 --> 12:16.913
No, wait!

12:22.919 --> 12:24.720
Don't even think about it, hero.

12:24.988 --> 12:26.121
Throw your gun away!

12:26.521 --> 12:29.825
Throw it away! Get inside now!

12:30.392 --> 12:32.461
Into the living room.

12:33.729 --> 12:36.765
Alright, just...
just take it easy.

12:36.933 --> 12:38.266
It's, it's Avery, right?

12:39.735 --> 12:41.436
Look.

12:41.570 --> 12:44.206
Just give me the gun
and we can end this.

12:44.339 --> 12:46.441
Nobody else has to get hurt.

12:46.575 --> 12:47.476
Okay?

12:47.609 --> 12:50.646
Shut up! Everybody
on their knees!

12:51.346 --> 12:52.447
I need to think!

12:59.956 --> 13:02.190
It was him.

13:02.324 --> 13:04.259
I thought it was
just like a game

13:04.393 --> 13:06.695
an urban legend you know?

13:06.828 --> 13:08.463
A kid's story.

13:08.898 --> 13:09.698
Tick tock!

13:09.831 --> 13:12.367
Look.
Avery.

13:13.735 --> 13:14.503
It's alright.

13:14.636 --> 13:16.772
Just give me the gun.

13:17.305 --> 13:18.473
Your friends were hurt tonight.

13:18.607 --> 13:20.143
They need our help.

13:20.375 --> 13:22.277
It's okay. We can help you.

13:22.477 --> 13:24.413
I didn't mean to hurt him.

13:24.947 --> 13:26.815
I didn't kill anyone else.

13:26.983 --> 13:29.718
I barley escaped,
don't you get it!?

13:32.187 --> 13:33.622
Him who? What game?

13:33.822 --> 13:35.857
Yo! Are you
kidding me with this shit!?

13:36.125 --> 13:37.693
This bitch is fucking crazy!

13:38.061 --> 13:39.929
Blaming some
bullshit game!?

13:40.529 --> 13:41.830
- Shut up Carter!
- She's fucking whacked!

13:41.964 --> 13:43.398
Shut up!

13:43.832 --> 13:47.904
Look, Avery,
whatever you think happened

13:48.804 --> 13:50.173
it's okay.

13:50.338 --> 13:51.908
We can talk about it.

13:52.041 --> 13:54.911
Just give me the gun,
we can help you.

13:55.444 --> 13:57.279
I'm the only one that survived.

13:57.412 --> 13:58.981
Don't you see?

13:59.115 --> 14:00.382
I don't know how to stop him.

14:00.515 --> 14:04.820
- Stop who!?
- I don't know who or what he is.

14:05.420 --> 14:07.255
He comes in your sleep.

14:07.389 --> 14:09.624
Who comes in
your sleep sweetie?

14:10.193 --> 14:11.660
The Sandman.
Tick Tock.

14:11.793 --> 14:13.930
Oh, oh!

14:14.063 --> 14:15.397
Oh Freddy Kreuger did it!?

14:15.530 --> 14:18.533
Yeah, this twat's fucking crazy!

14:19.501 --> 14:20.869
That's enough Carter!

14:21.003 --> 14:22.571
- It's stupid bullshit!
- That's enough!

14:22.704 --> 14:25.007
She's a killer! We all saw it!

14:25.273 --> 14:27.242
She's just trying to
blame some fake-ass wanna-be

14:27.375 --> 14:30.046
boogeyman! The Sandman!?

14:30.512 --> 14:33.682
Yeah. Look, the insanity
defense is a good one,

14:33.815 --> 14:36.119
keep going with that
you crazy fucking bitch!

14:36.251 --> 14:37.719
- Shut up!
- Fuck you!

14:37.853 --> 14:41.289
You think it's just a game?
You think he isn't real?

14:41.623 --> 14:43.192
Its just my imagination?

14:43.692 --> 14:46.062
Then we're all gonna play a
little game together.

14:46.862 --> 14:49.198
We'll see what scares
you by the end of the night.

14:49.564 --> 14:51.767
So you
want us to play a stupid game!?

14:51.901 --> 14:52.935
Its not a game!

14:54.636 --> 14:56.738
Its real! Tick tock.

14:56.872 --> 14:58.573
Then what
do you want us to do?

15:00.176 --> 15:01.676
You.

15:01.810 --> 15:05.081
You take her and her and go find
some candles and something

15:05.214 --> 15:06.281
to cut with.

15:06.448 --> 15:08.650
Let me go, just
leave them alone.

15:09.018 --> 15:10.819
Shut up Ms. Perfect.

15:11.921 --> 15:14.623
No one better
get a hero complex.

15:14.924 --> 15:19.262
I still got five
bullets left. You three go!

15:19.861 --> 15:20.862
Now!

15:24.666 --> 15:27.203
Don't even think about moving.

15:29.638 --> 15:34.643
Keep your eyes open.
Something strange is going on.

15:35.777 --> 15:37.880
This doesn't make any sense.

15:38.680 --> 15:40.116
Yeah you're damn right.

15:40.249 --> 15:42.551
A little girl like that
killing all of those people?

15:44.086 --> 15:45.654
I can't believe it.

15:46.521 --> 15:47.556
Me either.

15:49.424 --> 15:51.894
Still. These kids these days.

15:52.028 --> 15:55.597
You know what, don't go all
Lucas Dylan on me!

15:56.966 --> 15:58.366
Don't lose focus!

15:58.500 --> 15:59.534
Balls.

16:00.702 --> 16:01.904
It's just one girl.

16:03.072 --> 16:06.075
It's just one girl with a trail
of bodies behind her.

16:07.475 --> 16:08.810
Yeah fair enough.

16:18.254 --> 16:20.522
- Ok, now what do we do?
- Now we sit around for the next

16:20.655 --> 16:22.791
three and a half half hours
watching our candles

16:22.925 --> 16:25.194
burn while this psycho cunt
tries to figure out how to kill

16:25.328 --> 16:26.761
us all and escape.

16:28.297 --> 16:31.466
Meanwhile Barney Fife here and
TJ Hooker outside get to die

16:31.600 --> 16:33.202
- heroes.
- Shut the hell up, Carter.

16:33.336 --> 16:34.569
Fuck you RJ!

16:34.703 --> 16:36.205
No! Fuck you
Carter this is your fault!

16:36.339 --> 16:40.508
My fault? She holds us at
gunpoint and it's my fault!?

16:40.642 --> 16:42.811
It's your fault
we even have to do any of this!

16:42.945 --> 16:46.315
Can you guys just
take it easy okay?

16:46.448 --> 16:48.217
I'm gonna get us out of this.

16:48.416 --> 16:49.751
This is bullshit!

16:49.886 --> 16:51.753
Yo, just keep your
candle lit and that's it!

16:51.888 --> 16:53.722
It's a fucking kid's game!

16:54.223 --> 16:56.926
Might as well be saying Bloody
Mary in front of a goddamn

16:57.059 --> 16:57.659
mirror!

16:57.792 --> 17:00.662
No! That's not it!

17:01.563 --> 17:04.099
The midnight Man?

17:05.433 --> 17:07.535
This would be his greatest fear.

17:09.271 --> 17:10.272
You think you know.

17:10.940 --> 17:14.843
but you don't, but you will.

17:15.477 --> 17:16.711
You all will.

17:18.047 --> 17:22.285
First of all, you can
forget whatever you think you

17:22.416 --> 17:26.955
know or saw in some shitty indie
movie 'cause this ain't no game!

17:27.521 --> 17:29.758
This ain't no
bullshit Midnight Man!

17:31.726 --> 17:33.595
This is real.

17:34.729 --> 17:36.165
The Sandman is real.

17:39.235 --> 17:40.102
Tick Tock!

17:40.236 --> 17:41.270
Tick tock!

17:41.404 --> 17:46.508
Hello!?
Hey, hey. Crazy bitch!

17:48.210 --> 17:52.014
When all of the blood is on the
paper, its time to invite the

17:52.148 --> 17:53.115
Sandman in.

17:55.151 --> 17:57.519
Once he's here,
he's here until dawn.

17:59.088 --> 18:02.557
if you try to leave
or turn on the lights,

18:02.691 --> 18:03.960
he'll kill you.

18:05.027 --> 18:09.231
When you see him, it's
the last thing you'll see.

18:11.200 --> 18:15.204
And you better pray you
survive and don't wake up.

18:17.006 --> 18:20.742
and all you can do is try to
survive your worst nightmares

18:21.710 --> 18:24.947
and hope
that you beat him.

18:27.682 --> 18:29.318
I thought you weren't
supposed to fall asleep?

18:29.919 --> 18:32.854
No no no no no!
That's what I'm saying!

18:33.356 --> 18:38.560
This is real! you have to beat
him at his game!

18:39.362 --> 18:41.397
But what do you mean we
have to try to survive our worst

18:41.529 --> 18:42.932
nightmares?

18:45.434 --> 18:46.768
Look at me.

18:48.703 --> 18:50.572
What do you think?

18:51.941 --> 18:54.709
He wants you to wake
up so he can get you.

18:56.379 --> 18:59.581
Tick tock! Tick tock!

19:00.749 --> 19:02.385
And what if you don't?

19:02.517 --> 19:05.787
Oh then it's just easy!
You just have to survive your

19:05.921 --> 19:07.722
worst nightmares.

19:07.856 --> 19:10.393
Oh, I fucking told
y'all this bitch is crazy!

19:11.127 --> 19:16.298
Look, we're gonna be fine unless
she shoots us, get fucking real!

19:16.432 --> 19:18.334
Shut up Carter!

19:18.467 --> 19:21.170
Fine! Sure!

19:21.937 --> 19:25.807
As long as you all keep your
candles lit and stay asleep and

19:25.941 --> 19:28.576
survive your worst nightmares
you'll be fine!

19:28.944 --> 19:31.981
How are any of us
supposed to sleep?

19:32.314 --> 19:34.716
You don't have a choice!

19:34.849 --> 19:38.553
When he's here,
you'll go to sleep

19:38.686 --> 19:41.991
and stay asleep as long
as your candle is lit.

19:42.590 --> 19:44.293
What if it goes out?

19:47.562 --> 19:50.933
Avery! Get out! Go!

19:51.167 --> 19:55.237
The Sandman kills you as you sit
unless you get your candle

19:55.371 --> 19:56.472
- re-lit in time...
- Okay.

19:56.604 --> 19:58.374
- in time, in time.
- Okay, alright.

19:58.507 --> 20:00.775
You know what, Carter's
right, this is some bullshit!

20:00.910 --> 20:02.445
Complete bullshit!

20:02.677 --> 20:04.712
Bring me the paper!

20:11.887 --> 20:13.588
Light your candles.

20:20.595 --> 20:22.231
What now then!?

20:22.898 --> 20:24.967
Now I'll invite the Sandman.

20:25.867 --> 20:29.771
I'm not crazy! I'm
not crazy! You'll see!

20:30.738 --> 20:35.277
I'm not crazy, okay.

20:37.379 --> 20:42.784
Sandman come to me
tonight 'till morning's light,

20:44.019 --> 20:47.423
as darkness falls
and shadows loom,

20:47.822 --> 20:50.359
I bid you welcome to my room,

20:50.493 --> 20:52.727
rest your bones beside my bed,

20:52.861 --> 20:55.364
your spell of slumber deep,

20:55.498 --> 20:58.200
and stay beside me as I sleep,

20:58.700 --> 21:00.635
If I die before I wake,

21:01.103 --> 21:04.974
I grant to you my soul to take.

21:14.416 --> 21:15.918
Now we wait.

21:16.585 --> 21:19.754
This bitch is nuts,
and you fucking morons

21:19.889 --> 21:21.223
bought it!?

21:21.357 --> 21:22.958
I mean, we could
have rushed her, taken her gun,

21:23.092 --> 21:28.297
and been halfway to
Daytona by now but no.

21:29.265 --> 21:31.100
She doesn't have
the guts to shoot one of us on

21:31.233 --> 21:32.401
purpose anyway.

21:32.535 --> 21:34.003
Would you shut up kid!?

21:35.971 --> 21:39.741
Avery, Avery, look at me.

21:41.510 --> 21:43.445
Why don't you just
give me the gun okay?

21:44.180 --> 21:45.281
Look...

21:45.414 --> 21:47.616
I can take you
down to the station, we can talk

21:47.749 --> 21:51.887
about whatever happened to you
and your friends. It's ok.

21:52.488 --> 21:53.889
We can help you.

21:55.857 --> 21:57.059
It's okay.

21:59.761 --> 22:02.298
Sweetie, just,
just give him the gun.

22:03.831 --> 22:06.302
We know that you
didn't mean to do this.

22:07.536 --> 22:10.039
Maybe I am crazy.

22:12.508 --> 22:15.044
Just give him the gun!

22:19.014 --> 22:21.550
No! I'm not crazy!

22:21.884 --> 22:24.587
You'll see! He's coming!

22:25.120 --> 22:29.058
You'll see! I'm not crazy!!!

22:30.626 --> 22:36.031
THE
SANDMAN: Tick tock.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.367
See.

22:39.867 --> 22:40.835
Nobody move.

22:40.970 --> 22:42.770
Did you see that shit!?

22:42.905 --> 22:44.340
We gotta get out of here.

22:44.839 --> 22:46.675
Where, where is she!? Avery!?

22:46.808 --> 22:48.344
She's fucking dead man!

22:48.477 --> 22:50.179
And we're all gonna be
too if we don't leave!

22:50.312 --> 22:52.747
- Come on! Let's go!
- Yo! You can't leave!

22:52.881 --> 22:53.748
Didn't you hear her?!

22:53.882 --> 22:55.251
Oh so now you believe!?

22:55.384 --> 22:57.453
Oh and you don't!?
Yo, I believe what I saw!

22:57.653 --> 23:00.422
You know what!? You all can
fucking stay if you want,

23:00.556 --> 23:02.157
we're leaving!

23:02.291 --> 23:03.592
That fucking thing's hand just
went through her fucking chest

23:03.726 --> 23:04.960
I'm not standing
around to be next!

23:05.094 --> 23:07.229
That's enough! You
wanna live forever kid!?

23:08.863 --> 23:12.468
I'm sorry.

23:12.601 --> 23:13.868
No!

23:16.105 --> 23:19.774
Carter's right, I'm sorry...
I'm staying...

23:20.409 --> 23:22.111
We're all staying!

23:22.711 --> 23:27.082
She's right! Just stay
where you are, and and keep your

23:27.216 --> 23:30.185
- candles lit.
- RJ just sit down please!

23:31.320 --> 23:33.489
So, are we just supposed to sit
here all night!?

23:33.622 --> 23:37.660
I say we go! She couldn't have
been right about everything!

23:37.926 --> 23:40.362
I mean she said
we'd all be asleep right!?

23:40.862 --> 23:42.031
Right!?

23:42.398 --> 23:44.133
Do you really wanna test that?

23:45.367 --> 23:47.169
Do you?

23:48.070 --> 23:51.473
I'm in charge of each
and every one of you!

23:52.274 --> 23:54.710
I say we stay right
here and wait it out.

23:54.910 --> 23:57.379
We only have until
dawn, right?

23:57.513 --> 23:58.747
Yeah!

23:58.881 --> 24:01.684
She's right! Just stay
where you are.

24:02.817 --> 24:06.121
I can't even believe I'm
saying this, keep your candles

24:06.255 --> 24:10.259
lit and we'll stick
this out together.

24:10.392 --> 24:14.296
And don't forget. We're
already playing the game.

24:15.030 --> 24:16.532
What!?

24:16.665 --> 24:18.667
Wait, excuse me, but am I
the only one with a fucking

24:18.801 --> 24:20.069
brain!?

24:20.202 --> 24:21.737
Am I the only one who
fucking saw that!?

24:21.869 --> 24:23.238
We all seen it!

24:23.672 --> 24:25.974
It's amazing how
fast you change your tune.

24:26.408 --> 24:27.443
Big tough guy.

24:27.576 --> 24:28.777
Look at you now.

24:28.911 --> 24:30.279
Chicken Shit!!

24:30.946 --> 24:31.880
Chicken shit!?

24:32.014 --> 24:33.182
Yo, did you hear her!?

24:33.515 --> 24:36.685
She said we had to beat
him at his game now,

24:36.819 --> 24:40.589
I don't know about y'all but I'm
a fucking winner and I'm gonna

24:40.723 --> 24:43.158
walk out the door at the
end of this night!

24:43.292 --> 24:46.195
Now, you can all sit here and
sing Kumbaya, play tiddlywinks,

24:46.328 --> 24:49.164
or fucking jerk each
other off for all I care.

24:49.298 --> 24:51.100
I'm taking me and my
candle where none of y'all can

24:51.233 --> 24:54.269
fuck with it and
waiting it out alone.

24:57.172 --> 25:00.909
and if any of you try to
find me, I'll kill you myself.

25:02.311 --> 25:03.545
Kid!?

25:04.380 --> 25:04.980
Wait!

25:05.114 --> 25:06.648
Let him go.

25:07.316 --> 25:08.717
He ain't going anywhere.

25:09.852 --> 25:11.553
besides the first noise,
noise that he hears he will be

25:11.687 --> 25:14.156
in here up underneath our asses
pretending like we need he

25:14.289 --> 25:15.290
him.

25:16.191 --> 25:19.228
You know his type,
all talk no action.

25:30.038 --> 25:32.174
I'm walking
outta here tonight.

25:33.942 --> 25:36.245
I'm walking
outta here tonight.

25:41.016 --> 25:42.384
I'm walking out here.

25:42.886 --> 25:44.186
Now, what are we supposed to do?

25:44.486 --> 25:46.588
Just sit here and
wait for that thing to get us?

25:46.722 --> 25:50.459
No, if we stay together we
should be fine alright?

25:50.894 --> 25:52.361
And keep your candles lit!

25:52.861 --> 25:54.296
Right.

25:54.430 --> 25:56.765
That's fine and I can do
all of that, but I need to go to

25:56.900 --> 25:57.901
the bathroom first.

25:58.100 --> 25:59.368
No, you can't go.

25:59.868 --> 26:01.069
I'll be fine.

26:01.637 --> 26:03.672
Look, just, just take
someone with you okay?

26:03.806 --> 26:05.741
I will be fine!

26:06.241 --> 26:09.913
All I have to do is keep a
candle lit, pop a squat,

26:10.045 --> 26:13.015
tinkle and I'll be right back.

26:13.749 --> 26:15.484
Gwyn.

26:15.617 --> 26:16.952
You go girl!

26:28.730 --> 26:30.299
What the hell?

26:33.469 --> 26:34.636
Oh my God.

26:36.338 --> 26:38.106
Is this for real?

26:40.409 --> 26:44.246
I must say, if this
is my worst nightmare,

26:45.681 --> 26:48.317
I don't want to
wake up, it's pretty good!

26:52.988 --> 26:56.291
Okay. Get a grip!

26:59.161 --> 27:00.362
Still.

27:00.529 --> 27:02.064
Oh my God.

27:04.333 --> 27:06.502
Okay, that's enough!

27:15.043 --> 27:16.812
Open the door.

27:17.246 --> 27:18.614
Open the door.

27:20.382 --> 27:21.783
Can anybody hear me!?

27:21.918 --> 27:23.619
Open the door!

27:24.219 --> 27:26.288
I'm serious!

27:27.356 --> 27:30.726
Come on! Joke's over!

27:34.129 --> 27:35.797
Bo?

27:36.832 --> 27:38.567
Somebody!? Anybody!?

27:42.972 --> 27:44.239
She shouldn't have gone.

27:44.373 --> 27:46.241
Did you want her to
piss right here!?

27:46.375 --> 27:48.310
Would you just
shut up Brittany!?

27:48.443 --> 27:50.546
Your mouth just has
to always be open don't it!?

27:50.880 --> 27:52.214
Just like your goddamn legs!

27:52.347 --> 27:53.448
You know what - fuck you!

27:53.582 --> 27:56.351
- Fuck you!
- Both of you, stop!

27:56.618 --> 28:00.957
Everybody stop arguing
alright! It doesn't get us

28:01.089 --> 28:05.827
anywhere and it's stupid! Look,
I know this may be new for you

28:05.962 --> 28:08.297
guys but if we want to pull
through with this you're going

28:08.430 --> 28:10.432
to have to work together!

28:11.233 --> 28:14.469
Now, that means
we keep our shit wired tight!

28:14.938 --> 28:17.406
So, if you want to
go to the bathroom you hold it

28:17.539 --> 28:20.509
and if you want to
open your mouth, you don't!

28:22.311 --> 28:27.316
You keep your cool! I sure as
hell am not dying in a goddamn

28:27.449 --> 28:29.284
sorority house tonight alright!?

28:30.053 --> 28:35.257
None of us are, okay!
Look, we have to get Gwyn and

28:35.457 --> 28:37.693
that little douche bag back
here and make sure they

28:37.826 --> 28:40.495
park their asses
until the time is up!

28:42.397 --> 28:44.766
You, what's your name?

28:46.903 --> 28:48.236
RJ.

28:48.403 --> 28:50.439
Alright, RJ, look.

28:50.739 --> 28:53.308
You get your buddy
and bring him back here.

28:53.542 --> 28:55.744
I will escort
Ms. Prescott, okay.

28:56.211 --> 28:57.546
No.

28:57.679 --> 28:58.714
What!?

28:59.114 --> 29:00.482
I'm not moving.

29:01.249 --> 29:02.484
Way to pick 'em Erin!

29:03.452 --> 29:05.153
Look. I'm sorry alright.

29:06.521 --> 29:08.123
But you were right before.

29:08.724 --> 29:11.693
I mean y'all saw that
thing, everybody saw it.

29:14.529 --> 29:17.699
I'm gonna stay here and make
sure my candle stays lit.

29:19.102 --> 29:21.169
I'm not moving.

29:22.204 --> 29:24.040
You know what. I'll go.

29:24.172 --> 29:25.741
No, you shouldn't.

29:25.874 --> 29:28.510
Shouldn't what!? Go because
I'm a girl!? Give me a break!

29:29.378 --> 29:31.047
At least take
someone with you okay.

29:31.179 --> 29:31.881
I'll go!

29:33.782 --> 29:34.816
Okay, fine.

29:34.951 --> 29:37.120
Just stay together
and come right back.

29:37.753 --> 29:40.555
Its across
the house. We'll be okay!

29:40.722 --> 29:42.025
Don't go.

29:42.157 --> 29:44.693
I can't just sit here and do
nothing, even if you can.

29:44.994 --> 29:47.329
Maybe my dad was right.

29:51.166 --> 29:55.071
I'll be right back. If anything
happens, just yell like hell.

29:55.203 --> 29:57.472
Okay?

30:29.771 --> 30:30.605
No!

30:30.739 --> 30:33.009
- Jesus!
- No lights, remember?

30:33.142 --> 30:34.509
I don't see him anyway.

30:34.776 --> 30:36.378
Why don't we just split up?

30:36.511 --> 30:38.413
Yeah cause that always
works out in scary movies.

30:38.547 --> 30:40.348
All we have to do is
keep our candles lit and we're

30:40.482 --> 30:43.218
- fine right?
- Tick tock.

30:44.820 --> 30:46.022
Right.

33:15.604 --> 33:18.773
Oh my God you asshole!

33:18.908 --> 33:19.942
Asshole huh?

33:24.180 --> 33:27.016
We need to find Erin
and get back to the circle.

33:28.750 --> 33:30.086
Did you hear me!?

33:33.289 --> 33:35.992
Okay! Easy tiger!

33:36.125 --> 33:38.660
We don't have time for that and
if we did, you wouldn't know

33:38.793 --> 33:40.629
what to do with me.

33:54.343 --> 33:55.410
Okay.

33:58.214 --> 33:59.581
Gwyn?

34:01.350 --> 34:02.484
Ms. Prescott!?

34:05.121 --> 34:08.090
Hold on, I'm coming!

34:19.235 --> 34:24.606
Harder! You got me in the mood,
now let's go!

34:25.206 --> 34:29.045
That's more like it!

34:33.248 --> 34:34.716
Okay!
That's enough!

34:34.849 --> 34:37.119
We don't have a
safe word, stop!

34:38.620 --> 34:42.690
Enough! Enough!
I said that's enough!

34:52.969 --> 34:54.469
Why?

34:54.601 --> 34:59.442
Carter, let me go.
Fucking asshole.

35:09.318 --> 35:11.220
Tick tock.

35:19.895 --> 35:24.799
No! No! No! Oh God
No!...No!!!!!...no, no, no.

36:14.116 --> 36:16.352
Well, I'll be goddamned.

36:16.485 --> 36:18.988
What do we got here?

36:19.821 --> 36:21.357
Wha-what?

36:21.490 --> 36:23.259
What!? What the hell do you mean
what!? You about knocked me the

36:23.392 --> 36:26.262
hell on my ass! What you ought
to do is excuse yourself for

36:26.395 --> 36:28.030
coming in here all half-cocked!

36:28.164 --> 36:32.767
Instead of tearing ass into
somebody! Ain't that right Hal?!

36:33.536 --> 36:36.805
That's right Zeke!
These little college whores just think

36:36.939 --> 36:39.874
they can come
out here run all into anybody,

36:40.009 --> 36:44.113
do any goddamn thing they
want - ain't that right Zeke!?

36:44.246 --> 36:46.282
Uh huh!

36:46.415 --> 36:48.817
I didn't mean to, I didn't-

36:51.020 --> 36:53.422
Come out here with her
tits all bouncing, ass all

36:53.556 --> 36:58.360
hanging out. You know, this
used to be our mama and daddy's

36:58.494 --> 37:02.164
place back before little whores
like you came out here.

37:03.299 --> 37:05.867
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to-

37:06.001 --> 37:09.305
You didn't mean to what!?
Knock me on my ass?

37:09.438 --> 37:12.341
Come out here dressed
like that. You trying to tease

37:12.475 --> 37:15.177
us? Is that what you're doing?

37:15.311 --> 37:18.547
That's exactly what she's doing!
Coming out here bumping into

37:18.680 --> 37:21.984
my brother tits first, you know
he can't take that kind of

37:22.118 --> 37:26.322
excitement - he's got a goddamn
heart condition for fuck's sake!

37:26.688 --> 37:27.622
I'm sorry!

37:27.755 --> 37:30.625
Oh, now
you're sorry!?

37:33.162 --> 37:37.032
Well, I think we got us a little
girl that needs a lesson in

37:37.166 --> 37:40.469
manners like the way that
mama and daddy used to teach

37:40.603 --> 37:43.139
it. Don't you?

37:43.272 --> 37:47.910
I like that idea. That's a
fucking fantabulous idea!

37:48.310 --> 37:51.514
We gonna have you whistling
zippity fucking doo dah out

37:51.646 --> 37:54.383
that sweet ass of yours when
we're done with you.

37:54.517 --> 37:59.054
No! I just wanted to run! I'm
sorry! I'm sorry.

37:59.188 --> 38:03.225
Please let me go! Please.

38:03.359 --> 38:05.294
Alright.

38:06.694 --> 38:09.864
We don't like teasing,
do we Hal?

38:09.999 --> 38:14.904
No. We don't.
You're all ours now.

38:20.075 --> 38:22.344
We're gonna show you why
little girls shouldn't be out

38:22.478 --> 38:24.880
here all alone.

38:25.014 --> 38:29.751
Oh goddamnit, we're doing
the teasing now!

38:38.527 --> 38:43.933
Tick tock bitch!
Tick tock! Tick tock!

38:50.838 --> 38:55.843
Tick tock... Tick tock...

38:59.582 --> 39:03.919
Tick tock! Tick tock bitch!

39:33.916 --> 39:37.785
Tick tock. Tick tock.

40:06.348 --> 40:10.052
Ms. Prescott!?

40:10.185 --> 40:14.490
Gwyn?

40:16.925 --> 40:19.561
Tick tock.

40:31.240 --> 40:35.678
Gwyn!? Gwyn, are you okay!?

40:35.810 --> 40:39.415
What's wrong!? Are you hurt!?

40:39.548 --> 40:40.749
My face.

40:40.883 --> 40:42.518
TRENT - What!?
GWYN - My face.

40:42.651 --> 40:46.288
What's wrong with your face!?
Your face is fine! Gwyn!

40:46.422 --> 40:49.725
You're okay! Look, I need
you to hold this for me okay!?

40:49.857 --> 40:51.859
Take it okay!? We're going to go
back to the others alright!?

40:51.994 --> 40:55.497
You can do it, let me help you
up here come on, here we go,

40:55.631 --> 40:58.866
together.

41:00.669 --> 41:02.304
I got you.

41:20.055 --> 41:23.959
Tick tock.

41:27.730 --> 41:28.831
Did
you hear that?

41:28.997 --> 41:32.101
No, I didn't hear
anything.

41:32.234 --> 41:34.503
Tick tock.

41:41.143 --> 41:43.479
I heard it that time.

41:53.155 --> 41:54.690
Gwyn, I need
you to go down to the living

41:54.823 --> 41:56.525
room and stay there
with the others okay!?

41:56.658 --> 41:59.228
No I'm not leaving you here by
yourself! Don't ma'am me I told

41:59.361 --> 42:00.696
you I'm not going anywhere

42:00.829 --> 42:02.931
Go! Now!

42:03.065 --> 42:04.933
Just stay behind me!

42:05.067 --> 42:07.369
It won't open! It's locked!

42:07.503 --> 42:10.506
Stay behind me!

42:30.058 --> 42:32.161
It can't be.

42:34.263 --> 42:36.965
What's
the matter baby boy?

42:37.232 --> 42:40.102
Aren't you happy
to see your old man?

42:40.904 --> 42:44.908
This can't be. Dad!?

42:45.240 --> 42:49.545
Wait, wait,
wait. Jack?!

42:49.678 --> 42:51.647
Gwyn.

42:51.780 --> 42:53.115
Don't move Gwyn!

42:53.248 --> 42:54.850
What!? It's just your
father, he's a legend.

42:54.983 --> 42:57.586
No, no... no.

42:59.755 --> 43:02.124
I see you still think
you can control every

43:02.257 --> 43:04.894
man on the planet Gwyn.

43:05.027 --> 43:07.095
Jack, we need your help!

43:07.229 --> 43:09.431
I know what you need!

43:10.098 --> 43:12.201
But what are you
prepared to do about it?

43:12.334 --> 43:16.271
- Trent, what's going on?

43:16.405 --> 43:19.775
I don't know, just, just
stay behind me okay.

43:19.909 --> 43:24.446
What are you doing here kid?
Is this what I taught you?

43:24.580 --> 43:28.350
Is it!?

43:28.484 --> 43:33.121
Is this what
I gave up my life for?

43:35.424 --> 43:38.060
If you're gonna do something,
you do your best or

43:38.193 --> 43:40.062
you stand down.

43:40.796 --> 43:44.233
It was one test dad! I
will pass it next time alright!?

43:44.366 --> 43:46.268
I'm glad that your
mother is not here,

43:46.401 --> 43:48.670
it's a disgrace
to her memory.

43:48.804 --> 43:51.473
Did you ever think maybe I
wanted something different for

43:51.607 --> 43:53.075
myself?

43:53.208 --> 43:54.776
When I was growing up my

43:54.911 --> 43:57.713
father used to say there were
three things that really matter:

43:57.846 --> 44:02.050
Country, God and Family.

44:03.953 --> 44:06.321
Well, I don't wanna be him!

44:08.223 --> 44:10.092
In the first five
minutes of combat you will

44:10.225 --> 44:13.795
find out more about yourself and
everybody around you than you

44:13.930 --> 44:15.899
will in the rest of your life.

44:16.064 --> 44:19.002
Well, I'm not a soldier dad! And
I'm not a hero like you and

44:19.134 --> 44:22.304
I don't
want to be anything like you!

44:24.573 --> 44:29.044
Don't move! Hands up!

44:32.882 --> 44:34.516
Dad!

44:35.985 --> 44:39.187
I said don't move!

44:41.723 --> 44:43.225
Hands up Miller!

44:43.358 --> 44:47.863
Jake Beasley? I thought
you were doing 25 to life.

44:47.997 --> 44:51.833
There's no pen that
can hold me, not as long as

44:51.968 --> 44:53.602
you're alive!

44:54.703 --> 44:56.705
This is my son.

44:58.707 --> 45:00.309
I know.

45:15.591 --> 45:19.227
Dad! Dad, I don't know what
to do, there's so much blood!

45:19.361 --> 45:21.129
I gotta call for help!

45:21.263 --> 45:24.700
No. You go get him.

45:27.235 --> 45:29.338
I can't leave you here -
there's so much -

45:29.471 --> 45:30.872
- you're gonna bleed!

45:31.007 --> 45:36.378
You don't want to live forever,
do you kid? Go... go.

45:39.481 --> 45:43.752
Dad!?...Dad!?...Dad!?

45:52.427 --> 45:56.531
Speak boy. Is that
what I took that bullet for?

45:56.665 --> 45:59.267
No sir.

45:59.969 --> 46:03.305
- Is it!?
- No sir!

46:03.872 --> 46:05.008
I can't hear you!

46:05.140 --> 46:06.875
No Sir!

46:13.281 --> 46:18.487
Look at you. Don't move, stand
behind me. Who do you think

46:18.654 --> 46:21.857
you are? You think
you're in control here?

46:22.959 --> 46:27.964
This can't be. You're dead.

46:28.664 --> 46:32.135
You'd like that wouldn't
you? So I couldn't see

46:32.267 --> 46:34.803
that you let
Beasley get away with it?

46:34.937 --> 46:39.875
No! No, I got my man - I - I
brought him in.

46:40.009 --> 46:42.177
You got nothing! There's only

46:42.310 --> 46:46.515
one way to handle a psychopath
and you didn't have the guts.

46:47.016 --> 46:51.120
It's pathetic! All these
people - all these innocent

46:51.253 --> 46:52.821
people are dying-

46:52.955 --> 46:58.161
Stop it Jack! Trent, let's go!
Let's get out of here!

46:58.326 --> 47:01.229
No, you run Gwyn.

47:02.230 --> 47:06.802
You remember Orwell?
What did we say?

47:06.936 --> 47:08.770
Say It!

47:08.905 --> 47:10.605
People sleep peaceably

47:10.739 --> 47:14.376
in their beds because rough men
stand ready to do violence on

47:14.509 --> 47:15.644
their behalf!

47:15.777 --> 47:17.046
Again!

47:17.180 --> 47:19.681
People sleep peaceably
in their beds at night because

47:19.815 --> 47:23.920
rough men stand ready to do
violence on their behalf!

47:24.286 --> 47:28.223
Good. You're getting better.

47:29.125 --> 47:32.895
Now listen, you're busy
playing cops and robbers while

47:33.029 --> 47:36.431
all these innocent people are
gonna die and it's all gonna be

47:36.565 --> 47:39.868
your fault.

47:40.002 --> 47:45.407
Hey, now, you don't wanna
live forever, do ya kid?

47:51.147 --> 47:56.318
Tick tock son. Tick tock.

47:57.719 --> 48:02.925
Miller!? Miller!? Wake up!
Come on! Snap to it! Miller!?

48:05.827 --> 48:07.130
Ms. Prescott!?

48:07.262 --> 48:08.931
You okay?

48:09.065 --> 48:10.766
What happened!?

48:10.900 --> 48:14.904
We seen something at the end
of the hall. We both heard it!

48:15.037 --> 48:20.442
Then you just passed out. Are
you okay!? Huh? Are you okay!?

48:21.978 --> 48:23.246
Yeah, okay.

48:23.378 --> 48:26.949
Come on, let's get back to
the living room. Come on.

48:28.050 --> 48:29.952
Splitting up!

48:30.086 --> 48:35.457
What the hell was I thinking!?
That never ends well.

48:36.192 --> 48:38.161
At last I still have my candle.

48:38.293 --> 48:40.263
Tick tock.

48:40.395 --> 48:44.299
Hello!? Who's there!?

48:46.102 --> 48:50.739
Get a grip!

48:50.872 --> 48:53.675
Jesus! Fuck! RJ!

48:54.643 --> 48:56.444
I thought you
weren't gonna move?

48:56.578 --> 48:59.182
I came
to find you. We need to talk.

48:59.314 --> 49:00.448
Here? Now?

49:00.582 --> 49:02.151
Yes! Here. Now.

49:02.285 --> 49:03.252
I have to
find Carter.

49:03.385 --> 49:06.488
Fuck Carter! We need to talk.

49:10.126 --> 49:13.662
Okay, you've got me.
I'm sitting here.

49:13.795 --> 49:14.462
Do I?

49:14.596 --> 49:15.697
Do you what?

49:15.831 --> 49:17.033
Have you?

49:17.166 --> 49:18.667
You're ridiculous! I
don't have time for this-

49:18.800 --> 49:20.136
Keep your fucking
ass in that fucking chair!

49:20.269 --> 49:25.440
Oh, you're gonna grow
a backbone now? Fine.

49:28.376 --> 49:29.946
When you look at me,
what do you see?

49:30.079 --> 49:33.682
- What do I see?
- Yes! What do you see?

49:33.815 --> 49:37.053
Fine! You want this right
here, right now?

49:37.186 --> 49:41.324
Fine! I see an
amazing guy who can't get over

49:41.456 --> 49:44.961
his own bullshit hang-ups to be
the man I want him to be.

49:45.094 --> 49:48.763
If you could just do that, you
would be the man I want to be

49:48.898 --> 49:53.903
with all of the time instead of
- this. That's what I see.

49:57.173 --> 49:58.241
That's what you see?

49:58.373 --> 49:59.541
That's what I see.

49:59.674 --> 50:00.910
Yeah, I know what you
really see.

50:01.043 --> 50:02.844
Oh really?
Why don't you tell me then?

50:02.979 --> 50:04.546
You see
the same thing your daddy does

50:04.679 --> 50:05.948
every time he looks at me

50:06.082 --> 50:06.949
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah!

50:07.083 --> 50:08.117
What's that!?

50:08.251 --> 50:10.052
A man who ain't
ever gonna be good enough!

50:10.186 --> 50:13.956
And not because he isn't smart
and not because he doesn't have

50:14.090 --> 50:18.493
potential, but because every
time you look at him the only

50:18.627 --> 50:22.831
thing you see is a
worthless-low-down-nigger.

50:22.965 --> 50:24.699
Erin - Hey!?
RJ - Yeah!

50:24.833 --> 50:28.870
An athlete. A field hand who
ain't worth noting more than an

50:29.005 --> 50:32.074
occasional good time for his
daughter every time she wants to

50:32.208 --> 50:35.577
make her daddy mad!

50:35.710 --> 50:39.481
Damn it!
I said tell me I'm wrong!

50:45.221 --> 50:50.425
What you said. Disgusts me.

50:51.961 --> 50:52.895
Does it!?

50:53.029 --> 50:54.696
Yes, it does.

50:54.829 --> 50:56.531
Why?
Erin - Why?

50:56.665 --> 50:58.867
I wanna know!

51:02.038 --> 51:07.243
You're good enough for me
RJ, more than good enough.

51:07.609 --> 51:09.644
But this fear you have,

51:09.778 --> 51:14.283
this constant worry about us and
how people see you.

51:14.417 --> 51:19.587
That's your problem! Nobody ever
spit in our face! Nobody ever

51:20.356 --> 51:24.393
told us we couldn't be
together! Nobody ever told you

51:24.526 --> 51:27.430
that you weren't good enough!

51:27.562 --> 51:31.766
All of this shit
is in your mind!

51:31.901 --> 51:33.568
And maybe that's
because you're just-

51:33.702 --> 51:35.037
Just what!?

51:35.171 --> 51:38.506
It's because the only person
that sees you as

51:38.640 --> 51:42.510
a nigger, is you!

51:46.382 --> 51:48.150
Erin!?

51:49.185 --> 51:50.886
Erin!?

52:00.396 --> 52:03.265
Come on! It'll be fun, trust me!

52:03.598 --> 52:05.001
Trust you!?

52:05.134 --> 52:07.269
Damn right trust me! Would I
ever steer you wrong!?

52:07.403 --> 52:08.737
Yes.

52:08.870 --> 52:10.106
You totally would.

52:10.906 --> 52:12.041
- It's true.
- Fine.

52:12.174 --> 52:13.675
Okay, but not this time!

52:13.808 --> 52:15.211
You're totally gonna dig it!

52:15.344 --> 52:17.246
You're gonna love it!

52:19.315 --> 52:21.783
Alright then.

52:46.841 --> 52:49.412
Guys, this is it?
A kegger!? Seriously!?

52:49.544 --> 52:51.080
Until the orgy starts.

52:51.213 --> 52:52.915
No! I should really be studying,
I have a world history test

52:53.049 --> 52:55.051
tomorrow!

52:55.184 --> 52:56.118
Oh my God.

52:56.252 --> 52:57.752
We are so not
going to miss you.

52:57.887 --> 52:59.155
Tell me about it!

52:59.288 --> 53:00.755
Wait, miss me? What do
you mean miss me!?

53:00.890 --> 53:02.657
I'm just glad we didn't
have to carry her!

53:02.791 --> 53:04.726
Yeah for real, the box
was heavy enough!

53:04.859 --> 53:06.162
Oh my god, you didn't
even have to dig!

53:06.295 --> 53:08.164
Oh please, neither did
you, that's what they're

53:08.297 --> 53:09.664
here for!

53:09.798 --> 53:10.598
You guys, what the hell are you
talking talking about?

53:10.732 --> 53:12.334
Babe, beer!

53:13.169 --> 53:14.803
It's a surprise.

53:15.171 --> 53:16.172
I don't get it.

53:16.405 --> 53:17.872
You'll see.

53:27.383 --> 53:29.717
Wait no! No! No! No!!!

53:30.186 --> 53:33.322
No! No! No!

53:33.456 --> 53:35.925
Please!!!!

53:39.328 --> 53:42.398
Please... please.

53:45.267 --> 53:47.036
Carter?

53:49.371 --> 53:52.774
Carter!

53:55.743 --> 53:58.047
Carter!

54:11.427 --> 54:13.229
Damn it! Carter?

54:14.296 --> 54:16.098
Where are you?

54:22.171 --> 54:23.339
Carter!

54:24.039 --> 54:25.673
Tick tock!

54:25.807 --> 54:27.876
Jesus!

54:29.011 --> 54:31.280
That better not be
you Carter Reese!

54:35.451 --> 54:37.286
Fuck it.

54:44.659 --> 54:46.262
Carter.

54:55.171 --> 54:56.738
Tick tock!

55:02.645 --> 55:05.981
Carter!? Oh my God!

55:06.382 --> 55:08.150
I got ya, didn't I?

55:08.284 --> 55:09.751
Bunch of scared
little bitches.

55:09.885 --> 55:11.253
Yeah, we're the bitches.

55:11.387 --> 55:12.555
I can't believe I
volunteered to come look for

55:12.687 --> 55:14.256
you, come on!

55:14.390 --> 55:16.892
No way! I told you guys, I'm
staying here until morning and

55:17.026 --> 55:18.527
then Carter Reese
is walking out that door.

55:18.661 --> 55:21.363
I can't come back without
you, RJ is already pissed!

55:21.497 --> 55:24.433
Well I guess you're staying
here, cause I'm not going!

55:24.567 --> 55:25.568
Stay here?

55:25.700 --> 55:26.801
- That's right!
- With you?

55:26.936 --> 55:28.971
- Yeah, with me!
- I don't think so!

55:29.104 --> 55:31.407
Come on! It's not like
you haven't done it before.

55:31.540 --> 55:35.377
That was a long time ago Carter
Reese, keep dreaming.

55:35.511 --> 55:37.146
No, this is your dream baby.

55:41.217 --> 55:45.753
Oh. Ah.

55:57.066 --> 56:00.502
Oh.

56:08.377 --> 56:09.811
Fuck.

56:11.813 --> 56:13.415
What the fuck!?

56:15.951 --> 56:18.554
- Dylan!?
- Dylan hold on we're coming!

56:18.687 --> 56:21.856
Lucas!? What's wrong with him!?

56:21.991 --> 56:24.326
- I don't know!
- Hold on, Lucas!

56:24.460 --> 56:26.161
Hurry up! He's choking!

56:31.433 --> 56:32.401
Leave the...

56:32.534 --> 56:33.435
kids...

56:33.569 --> 56:34.970
alone!

56:36.071 --> 56:38.674
Take me instead!

56:39.108 --> 56:42.278
Hold on!
He's choking!

56:43.778 --> 56:44.947
What the hell!?

56:45.080 --> 56:46.848
Just, just grab his arms!

56:47.449 --> 56:48.850
Fuck that!

56:52.787 --> 56:54.156
Singer!

57:19.415 --> 57:24.286
Somebody! Somebody

57:25.354 --> 57:29.792
Please help me!

57:33.962 --> 57:35.597

57:39.168 --> 57:42.304
Somebody help me please!

57:46.942 --> 57:48.410
Hi.

57:49.278 --> 57:50.913
What Bo?

57:51.246 --> 57:52.114
Please!

57:52.247 --> 57:53.749
You need something?

57:54.216 --> 57:58.087
Somebody!?
Somebody help me please.

58:01.623 --> 58:06.195
- You are so needy!
- Please. Please help me!

58:06.328 --> 58:08.731
- Please.
- Here Gwyn.

58:08.863 --> 58:09.898
You know you want to.

58:10.032 --> 58:11.066
Give me that!

58:11.200 --> 58:12.735
No, please!

58:12.867 --> 58:16.871
Please help me!
Please, no. Please.

58:17.005 --> 58:19.808
No, please. Please. Help me!

58:19.942 --> 58:22.077
- Who's next?
- I am!

58:22.211 --> 58:25.447
Please! Please help me!

58:59.815 --> 59:01.617
Why don't you come in RJ.

59:01.750 --> 59:03.285
Shut the door bro!

59:06.588 --> 59:10.058
Are you gonna come in or are you
to much of a pussy for that too?

59:10.192 --> 59:12.361
Too scared of what
people might think?

59:12.896 --> 59:14.663
What do you think of this?

59:15.631 --> 59:16.900
Do you like that?

59:17.032 --> 59:18.967
I know I do!

59:20.969 --> 59:24.373
You want me, come get me.

59:30.746 --> 59:32.981
Erin?

59:33.115 --> 59:35.050
Carter?

59:35.751 --> 59:37.887
How?

59:38.020 --> 59:39.955
Why?

59:40.422 --> 59:42.658
Sorry bro. Did you really think
she would be with you?

59:43.325 --> 59:44.793
Look at her and look at you.

59:45.093 --> 59:46.128
Look at me?

59:46.261 --> 59:48.330
Yeah, I mean bro...

59:48.464 --> 59:49.798
you're a little
too tan if you...

59:49.933 --> 59:50.833
Tan!?

59:51.767 --> 59:55.204
Oh, RJ. Don't take
it so hard, I mean...

59:55.337 --> 59:57.206
you said it yourself.

59:57.339 --> 59:59.508
You're nothing to me.

59:59.641 --> 01:00:01.310
Just a toy.

01:00:02.110 --> 01:00:04.646
A nigger to do
whatever I need him to do.

01:00:07.549 --> 01:00:08.550
Nigger?

01:00:09.518 --> 01:00:12.721
Did I stutter?
He is just a nigger, right?

01:00:13.522 --> 01:00:14.590
He is.

01:00:14.756 --> 01:00:15.657
You are.

01:00:15.791 --> 01:00:17.559
it is what it is, man.

01:00:22.966 --> 01:00:26.869
You were right about daddy.

01:00:27.603 --> 01:00:33.008
That's exactly how he
saw you and what can I say.

01:00:33.977 --> 01:00:35.544
I'm a daddy's girl.

01:00:41.383 --> 01:00:43.118
But you can
stay and watch us.

01:00:49.191 --> 01:00:52.761
And I guess that old
saying was wrong because

01:00:52.896 --> 01:00:54.796
I went black.

01:00:54.931 --> 01:00:57.799
And I couldn't wait to get back.

01:01:19.621 --> 01:01:22.992
Gwyn!? Gwyn wake up! Gwyn!

01:01:23.125 --> 01:01:24.693
Wake up!

01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:27.796
Bo! Bo wake up!
Can you hear me!?

01:01:27.931 --> 01:01:29.731
Jesus! Why won't they wake up?

01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:33.702
Tick tock!

01:01:41.209 --> 01:01:45.314
Don't move!

01:01:46.848 --> 01:01:50.552
I said don't move!
Show me your hands.

01:02:10.907 --> 01:02:12.341
Dear God.

01:02:18.146 --> 01:02:19.648
Look at him.

01:02:19.781 --> 01:02:21.817
He's pathetic!

01:02:22.117 --> 01:02:24.720
Go! Just go, loser!

01:02:27.489 --> 01:02:30.392
As if I was
ever a nigger lover.

01:03:00.957 --> 01:03:03.191
Inchoate.

01:03:03.325 --> 01:03:04.693
Run!

01:03:13.735 --> 01:03:15.771
Tick tock!

01:03:57.446 --> 01:04:00.315
- Please! Stop!
- Tick tock!

01:04:00.449 --> 01:04:03.485
Please stop! Please, God!

01:04:03.618 --> 01:04:07.222
Please, please. Help me!

01:04:07.355 --> 01:04:09.192
- Please!
- Quit that.

01:04:09.324 --> 01:04:10.659
Alright stop that crying, girl.

01:04:10.792 --> 01:04:11.860
Please help me!

01:04:12.661 --> 01:04:14.396
Bye!

01:04:14.529 --> 01:04:19.334
Please help me! No!

01:04:19.468 --> 01:04:21.003
No. Please!

01:04:21.137 --> 01:04:23.106
Please!

01:04:23.238 --> 01:04:24.773
Somebody!

01:04:27.176 --> 01:04:29.544
No! Somebody help me!

01:04:31.780 --> 01:04:35.417
Please. No. Please. Please!

01:04:35.817 --> 01:04:37.385
Please.

01:04:38.888 --> 01:04:39.821
Night, night!

01:04:39.956 --> 01:04:44.459
- Somebody help me, no!
- So needy!

01:04:44.593 --> 01:04:46.996
Please, help me, no!

01:04:48.064 --> 01:04:50.032
Somebody!

01:04:57.073 --> 01:04:58.573
Carter?

01:04:58.707 --> 01:05:02.811
I told you.
I'm walking out of here alive.

01:05:04.213 --> 01:05:05.680
Carter?

01:05:06.748 --> 01:05:07.884
Bo?

01:05:08.450 --> 01:05:09.818
Carter?

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:11.753
Tick tock.

01:05:14.289 --> 01:05:15.624
Carter!?

01:05:19.528 --> 01:05:20.963
Tick tock!

01:05:21.097 --> 01:05:22.364
- Carter!?
- Bo.

01:05:27.069 --> 01:05:29.671
I don't know when I'm going to
learn my lesson with you.

01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:32.674
So this is it huh?

01:05:34.342 --> 01:05:34.944
Unbelievable.

01:05:36.245 --> 01:05:39.048
So, you're just gonna get me out
here, get me all ready to go,

01:05:39.182 --> 01:05:40.016
and what?

01:05:40.149 --> 01:05:41.449
Just leave me hanging?

01:05:43.920 --> 01:05:46.321
This because I
went out with your sister?

01:05:47.455 --> 01:05:49.558
I only did that
to get close to you.

01:05:49.791 --> 01:05:52.427
Make you jealous, you know
I had no real interest in her.

01:05:54.063 --> 01:05:56.598
But I can see none of that
makes a difference to you.

01:05:59.534 --> 01:06:03.872
No, this has nothing to do with
me and your sister does it?

01:06:04.207 --> 01:06:05.640
No, it's all about you!

01:06:06.441 --> 01:06:10.745
All part of your disgusting need
to fuck everyone you can as

01:06:10.880 --> 01:06:13.481
much as you can just to prove
something to yourself.

01:06:13.615 --> 01:06:15.117
Isn't that right!?

01:06:16.418 --> 01:06:19.721
You'll do anything you can to
hide how you feel about me from

01:06:19.855 --> 01:06:21.456
everyone!

01:06:21.756 --> 01:06:24.327
Your sister, your mom, your dad,
your friends.

01:06:25.161 --> 01:06:29.364
From yourself. All just to
hide the fact that you're gay!?

01:06:31.901 --> 01:06:35.171
Admit it! Be proud
of who you are.

01:06:35.670 --> 01:06:37.539
- Admit it goddamn it!
- That's enough!

01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:41.010
That's enough! I am so
sick of this shit!

01:06:42.410 --> 01:06:46.015
You're just like everybody else!
Just a self-righteous prick who

01:06:46.148 --> 01:06:50.219
wants everybody to do everything
their way! You hear me?!

01:06:51.386 --> 01:06:55.258
I don't need to go around
screaming or waving a flag just

01:06:55.390 --> 01:06:58.327
to know who I am.
You understand?

01:06:58.460 --> 01:06:59.262
I don't need a month.

01:06:59.394 --> 01:07:00.662
I don't need a day.

01:07:00.795 --> 01:07:03.065
And I don't need a march
just to validate me!

01:07:05.001 --> 01:07:08.070
You don't see my parents or my
friends out there organizing

01:07:08.204 --> 01:07:11.974
straight pride protests or
celebrations do you, huh!?

01:07:12.375 --> 01:07:14.176
You fucking hypocrite!

01:07:14.442 --> 01:07:15.344
It's different!

01:07:15.477 --> 01:07:16.946
No, no it's no different.

01:07:17.380 --> 01:07:19.614
You only think it's different
because someone with an agenda

01:07:19.748 --> 01:07:23.585
used you and told
you that it was different!

01:07:29.557 --> 01:07:32.694
Who or what I am
is my own business!

01:07:33.229 --> 01:07:34.230
You hear me?

01:07:34.931 --> 01:07:37.599
It's bullshit! You're hiding!

01:07:37.766 --> 01:07:39.668
But, but you can
keep lying to yourself.

01:07:39.801 --> 01:07:41.370
But what happens when
you can't hide behind that

01:07:41.503 --> 01:07:44.706
arrogant lady's man you try to
be and your secret gets out?

01:07:46.441 --> 01:07:50.612
If and when I want someone
to know, I will tell them.

01:07:51.113 --> 01:07:54.016
But until then,
nobody better find out.

01:07:54.150 --> 01:07:58.921
You hear me!? You
better keep your mouth shut!

01:08:02.058 --> 01:08:03.392
Oops.

01:08:13.269 --> 01:08:15.004
Carter let me get
a clear picture of you!

01:08:15.137 --> 01:08:17.538
Carter Reese, can you let us
know how long you've known

01:08:17.671 --> 01:08:18.773
you've been gay?

01:08:18.908 --> 01:08:20.343
Let me get a clear
picture of you!

01:08:20.475 --> 01:08:22.411
Are you bisexual or are
you just paying women to have

01:08:22.544 --> 01:08:23.712
sex with you!?

01:08:23.845 --> 01:08:25.381
...a picture of
you and your boyfriend!?

01:08:25.513 --> 01:08:27.917
...homosexual will hurt your
father's business in the UK?

01:08:28.050 --> 01:08:29.885
My boy in
there smoking pole!

01:08:30.019 --> 01:08:31.420
You said some ass was
getting pounded tonight,

01:08:31.553 --> 01:08:34.522
you didn't say it was your ass!

01:08:34.890 --> 01:08:37.960
Good morning GMU wants an
exclusive! I can see it now:

01:08:38.094 --> 01:08:41.997
Carter Reese from
frat boy to fabulous!

01:08:42.831 --> 01:08:45.100
Does your girlfriend
know you're queer!?

01:08:45.234 --> 01:08:47.801
How long have you been shagging
men in parked cars!?

01:08:47.937 --> 01:08:48.803
Does Brittany know!?

01:08:48.938 --> 01:08:51.107
What about your sister!?

01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:53.975
Is this why the PI girls say
you can't get it up!?

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:56.045
Are you pitching or catching?!

01:08:57.113 --> 01:08:58.747
Stop! Stop!

01:08:58.881 --> 01:09:00.916
Stop! Stop!

01:09:06.122 --> 01:09:08.590
Hey get back in there
and finish the job man!

01:09:14.196 --> 01:09:15.997
Poor...

01:09:16.131 --> 01:09:19.768
Go finish - hey go finish
the job you ain't done, yet!

01:09:32.180 --> 01:09:35.617
Faggot!

01:09:47.930 --> 01:09:50.698
Tick tock!

01:10:14.390 --> 01:10:16.192
Tick tock!

01:10:27.403 --> 01:10:29.305
Tick tock!

01:10:43.586 --> 01:10:46.021
Tick tock.

01:11:48.951 --> 01:11:52.521
]

01:11:52.655 --> 01:11:55.457
- Gwyn!?
- Tick tock.

01:11:55.591 --> 01:11:57.226
- Gwyn!?
- Bo! Bo, she's gone.

01:11:57.359 --> 01:11:58.360
Gwyn!

01:11:59.794 --> 01:12:01.796
Goddamn it listen
to me she's gone okay!?

01:12:01.931 --> 01:12:03.465
Here, look take this.

01:12:03.731 --> 01:12:05.968
You need
to get your candle lit alright!?

01:12:06.101 --> 01:12:08.537
Okay!? Focus on me alright!?

01:12:08.671 --> 01:12:10.005
- Look Bo...
- Oh my God!

01:12:10.139 --> 01:12:11.773
Bo look at me!
You're gonna make it okay!?

01:12:11.907 --> 01:12:15.843
You're gonna get out of here and
you're gonna be fine, alright?

01:12:15.978 --> 01:12:17.246
- Just stay with me.
- Oh my God!

01:12:17.379 --> 01:12:18.881
- take this and get your candle...
- Oh my God!

01:12:19.014 --> 01:12:20.282
Look at me.
Take this and get your candle

01:12:20.416 --> 01:12:21.917
lit and don't look back.
Whatever you do, do not

01:12:22.051 --> 01:12:24.353
look back. Okay?
You're gonna be fine alright!?

01:12:24.486 --> 01:12:25.753
We're gonna die.

01:12:25.888 --> 01:12:27.722
No! You're not
gonna die here tonight okay!?

01:12:27.923 --> 01:12:29.592
You're gonna be fine alright!?

01:12:29.724 --> 01:12:31.160
Wait! What about you? No.

01:12:31.293 --> 01:12:32.628
Don't worry about me,
I'm gonna buy you some time,

01:12:32.760 --> 01:12:34.096
do it now!

01:12:34.597 --> 01:12:36.764
It's just you and me.

01:12:43.738 --> 01:12:45.908
Yippee ki yay motherfucker.

01:12:47.643 --> 01:12:49.278
I always wanted to say that.

01:13:12.268 --> 01:13:14.370
Tick tock.

01:13:28.751 --> 01:13:32.221
Is that it!? Did I make it!?

01:13:36.759 --> 01:13:39.461
Tick tock.

01:13:46.035 --> 01:13:49.938
No! No, no, no, no! No! No! No!

I don't - I don't wanna die!

01:14:07.523 --> 01:14:08.823
I don't wanna die!

Please! No, just take her! Take
her not me! No! No! No... no...

Don't, don't leave me.

01:15:00.976 --> 01:15:03.278
Please don't leave me.

01:15:03.412 --> 01:15:05.514
Don't leave, please.

Please, no, just go.

01:16:22.926 --> 01:16:24.593
Just, just go.

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.096
Tick tock.

01:16:28.764 --> 01:16:30.466
You're just a myth.

01:16:30.599 --> 01:16:32.601
Yeah, you're just a
bedtime story.

01:16:33.435 --> 01:16:34.870
You're just a legend!

01:16:35.304 --> 01:16:39.641
Please! Please, just go! Just-
just go...

01:16:41.243 --> 01:16:42.978
Tick tock...

01:16:47.783 --> 01:16:49.218
Please no, just go!

01:16:49.818 --> 01:16:51.921
Please. Please.

01:16:52.054 --> 01:16:53.589
Please, no! Just go...

01:16:53.722 --> 01:16:54.490
just...

01:17:08.804 --> 01:17:10.672
My God.

01:17:13.742 --> 01:17:15.077
What are you?

01:17:26.622 --> 01:17:31.360
Just go. Just go.
This is a dream.

01:17:31.627 --> 01:17:34.530
This is a dream. This
is a dream! This can't be real!

01:17:35.797 --> 01:17:37.266
This can't be real!

01:17:41.303 --> 01:17:44.373
Why don't the lights work!?

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.409
The lights don't work... why
don't the lights work?

01:17:49.378 --> 01:17:50.879
My candle has to be lit.

01:17:52.314 --> 01:17:54.383
Why does my
candle have to be lit?

01:18:05.861 --> 01:18:07.262
Oh my...

01:18:11.600 --> 01:18:12.701
Singer?

01:18:14.503 --> 01:18:15.737
Singer?

01:18:19.808 --> 01:18:20.876
Oh, God.

01:18:21.010 --> 01:18:22.144
Olivia.

01:18:28.817 --> 01:18:30.218
Hold on.

01:18:33.255 --> 01:18:34.523
Hold on.

01:19:22.738 --> 01:19:25.908
What kind of Hell did
you invite in here?

01:19:28.077 --> 01:19:31.546
Oh my God.

01:19:31.948 --> 01:19:33.315
Miller!?

01:19:44.493 --> 01:19:47.596
Gwyn!? Gwyn!?

01:20:01.044 --> 01:20:02.411
Bo.

01:20:04.780 --> 01:20:07.349
Come on! Come and
get me you bastard!

01:20:07.482 --> 01:20:09.251
What are you waiting for you

01:20:09.384 --> 01:20:10.385
fucker, come here!

01:20:10.519 --> 01:20:13.188
Come and get me!
Come and get me.

01:20:15.857 --> 01:20:19.227
I'm here!

01:20:19.361 --> 01:20:21.130
Come and get me.

01:20:21.263 --> 01:20:23.966
What the fuck
are you waiting for!?

01:20:25.400 --> 01:20:26.635
- Come and get me.
- Tick tock!

01:20:30.372 --> 01:20:31.440
Come and get...

01:20:35.243 --> 01:20:36.211
Nice hit.

01:20:36.344 --> 01:20:37.914
For a bitch!

01:20:40.782 --> 01:20:43.251
Come on, little girl all
alone in the dark.

01:20:44.053 --> 01:20:46.822
Final showdown!
Let's see what you've got!

01:20:48.457 --> 01:20:49.926
I hope this works.

01:20:51.326 --> 01:20:54.763
Bo!? Bo, wake up!

01:20:55.430 --> 01:20:58.266
Bo!? Do you hear me?

01:20:59.468 --> 01:21:00.736
Bo, can you hear me!?

01:21:01.170 --> 01:21:02.370
Can you hear me!?

01:21:02.571 --> 01:21:05.340
Bo, say something! Come on!

01:21:07.642 --> 01:21:09.478
Bo!?

01:21:26.862 --> 01:21:28.497
Bo?

01:21:54.856 --> 01:21:57.960
Look you bastard!
Look at yourself!

01:21:58.261 --> 01:22:00.129
Is this your
biggest fear!?

01:22:00.762 --> 01:22:02.564
Is this your biggest
nightmare!?

01:22:03.465 --> 01:22:06.802
I said look goddamn it!
Look at yourself!

01:22:07.103 --> 01:22:09.471
Look goddamn it, look!

01:22:15.912 --> 01:22:17.146
Bo!?

01:22:17.280 --> 01:22:18.513
No.

01:22:18.647 --> 01:22:19.916
No, no, no... you're okay,

01:22:20.049 --> 01:22:21.083
you're awake,
you're alive, you're okay!

01:22:21.217 --> 01:22:23.019
No! What did you do!?

01:22:23.518 --> 01:22:25.087
You're okay, you're
awake, it's okay.

01:22:25.221 --> 01:22:29.258
