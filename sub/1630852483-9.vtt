There are many interesting things.

21:45.730 --> 21:48.840
I saw these back when I was in Qing.

21:49.740 --> 21:51.940
This does not seem
to be an ordinary guild.

they just locked us in here.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.700

22:30.110 --> 22:33.150
-Welcome back, ma'am.
-Did anything happen?

22:33.450 --> 22:34.980
We got news from Gokdu.

22:35.280 --> 22:37.150
They will pay for the gunpowder
as promised.

22:38.490 --> 22:39.550
Really?

22:40.250 --> 22:43.090
We were worried for nothing.
Everything is working out.

22:43.820 --> 22:46.590
That Leader Kang does not lack
common sense as much as we thought.

within two hours,

22:56.140 --> 22:59.110
Because of the big payment,
we will get a handful of stone shells.

Stop with the nonsense.

If you are thinking of tricking us
with the silver coins,

23:52.760 --> 23:53.990
think again.

23:54.900 --> 23:58.130
I sincerely hope
that you make a wise choice.

25:05.530 --> 25:08.270
I am sure she is more valuable
than a few silver coins.

25:08.940 --> 25:10.240
Especially to you.

25:14.770 --> 25:17.680
What I require are silver coins

-Let us return.
-Is that so?

25:27.620 --> 25:30.220
In chunks is what I will prefer this time.

While I was out by the water,

25:32.760 --> 25:35.130
your daughter was genuinely surprised
by the size of my bait.

I will chuck your goods in the water.

before using him as fish bait.

How did our lord who passed away...

46:09.090 --> 46:10.430
He was alive?

46:10.830 --> 46:12.300
Lord Yi-eon was alive.

46:12.360 --> 46:15.030
That is right. We could not find his body.

46:15.100 --> 46:18.200
Right. Our lord would never
pass away that easily.

46:23.010 --> 46:24.280
Hold on.

46:25.080 --> 46:28.310
Does that mean he deceived us
even though he was alive?

46:29.780 --> 46:32.680
You are right.
He must have had his reasons.

46:32.750 --> 46:34.550
But that is no excuse.

46:35.690 --> 46:37.620
-This is not right!
-This is not right!

46:39.060 --> 46:40.390
By the way,

46:40.460 --> 46:43.260
does not that lady's back look familiar?

46:43.760 --> 46:46.500
Her build, hair, and clothes.

46:48.230 --> 46:49.900
Is that Jo-yi?

46:50.670 --> 46:52.670
Stop being ridiculous.

46:52.810 --> 46:55.670
Did you forget she left
for Ganghwa Island with Gwang-soon?

47:00.810 --> 47:02.880
-Gwang-soon?
-Bi-ryeong!

47:04.180 --> 47:05.180
What?

47:05.550 --> 47:07.520
-Yuk-chil!
-Goo-pal!

47:14.830 --> 47:16.430
Why are you here?

47:18.460 --> 47:19.470
Have you gone mad?

47:19.670 --> 47:22.370
Should you not be seeing Lord Yi-eon off?

47:22.430 --> 47:24.040
He will be very upset.

47:24.100 --> 47:25.470
Get a grip.

47:25.540 --> 47:28.110
-She is right.
-Is it not his funeral right now?

47:28.370 --> 47:30.810
Have you lost your mind, Goo-pal?

47:30.880 --> 47:32.610
-Come to your senses.
-What are you doing?

47:32.680 --> 47:34.550
It hurts.

47:34.880 --> 47:36.110
It hurts!

47:36.950 --> 47:39.050
-That is not true.
-What is not?

47:39.120 --> 47:41.050
Stop. He is alive.

47:41.120 --> 47:43.020
Lord Yi-eon is alive!

47:44.560 --> 47:46.020
Lord Yi-eon is alive?

47:46.090 --> 47:47.690
Look.

47:52.530 --> 47:55.530
Then that man is Lord Yi-eon?

47:56.000 --> 47:57.170
Yes.

47:57.370 --> 47:59.100
-Really?
-Yes.

48:04.440 --> 48:07.150
-Gwang-soon!
-Gwang-soon?

48:07.280 --> 48:08.510
Gwang-soon!

48:09.680 --> 48:10.850
What do we do?

48:22.830 --> 48:25.630
But really! That little!

48:29.540 --> 48:31.140
Am I the only one who cannot see them?

48:32.300 --> 48:33.310
Where did they go?

48:33.370 --> 48:34.910
-They were there a minute ago.
-Where did they go?

48:41.150 --> 48:42.850
What happened?

48:43.220 --> 48:45.550
You should have sent us
a letter if you were alive.

48:46.850 --> 48:48.250
I had no choice.

48:49.520 --> 48:53.390
Some people would have pried
and confirmed my death again,

48:53.890 --> 48:55.560
so I had to be dead as a doornail.

48:57.100 --> 49:00.030
I had no idea.
I cried my eyes out and regretted--

49:00.100 --> 49:03.140
So you regretted it
and cried your eyes out.

49:06.770 --> 49:08.840
You must have missed me dearly.

49:29.130 --> 49:31.430
I almost fainted when the mine collapsed

49:31.500 --> 49:34.970
and you got buried
under the stone debris back then.

49:36.900 --> 49:38.640
How did you get out of there?

49:38.870 --> 49:40.610
Did the soldiers rescue you?

49:47.180 --> 49:49.380
[I was unconscious for a while.]

49:52.220 --> 49:53.850
[A butterfly flew by.]

49:54.350 --> 49:55.450
[A butterfly?]

49:55.550 --> 49:57.820
[How can a butterfly be inside a mine?]

49:58.320 --> 50:01.390
[You are right.
A butterfly in a mine is absurd.]

50:02.330 --> 50:03.900
[But the fact
that a butterfly flew inside]

50:04.260 --> 50:06.370
[also means there is a way out.]

50:07.330 --> 50:09.970
[So I followed it.]

50:20.410 --> 50:21.510
Tae-seo.

50:34.190 --> 50:35.630
I had no time to hesitate.

50:37.000 --> 50:38.830
To figure out the whole story
of the incident,

50:39.300 --> 50:40.770
I had no choice but to go after them.

50:42.370 --> 50:46.470
Does that mean you have been secretly
tracking down the case until now?

50:53.010 --> 50:54.410
Using my death,

50:54.480 --> 50:56.950
I was able to figure out the whole story.

50:59.750 --> 51:01.990
Are they not so wicked?

51:02.350 --> 51:03.890
How can a human being

51:03.960 --> 51:06.430
be that meticulously vicious?

51:06.790 --> 51:08.730
People who commit crimes

51:08.790 --> 51:10.560
are all meticulous.

51:11.700 --> 51:14.200
How would you commit a crime
if you were lazy?

51:15.430 --> 51:17.070
Those nasty jerks.

51:17.600 --> 51:19.710
This world is so cruel.

51:20.370 --> 51:22.940
I thought I'd get rewarded
if I worked hard,

51:23.310 --> 51:25.410
and things would get better if I tried.

51:26.210 --> 51:28.850
But those bad guys
are shamelessly living a happy life.

51:30.420 --> 51:32.480
Everything feels useless.

51:34.990 --> 51:37.220
I came to Hanyang
which was my dream place.

51:38.190 --> 51:39.590
And I met...

51:41.330 --> 51:42.890
my mother whom I have wanted to meet.

51:47.400 --> 51:48.970
But what was all that for?

51:59.140 --> 52:00.880
I realized when I died.

52:03.150 --> 52:05.020
That this moment with you...

52:06.450 --> 52:07.920
is not all that bad.

52:10.320 --> 52:11.360
So...

52:14.230 --> 52:16.060
life will not be as harsh.

52:17.600 --> 52:21.130
Because from now on,
I will be by your side.

52:27.240 --> 52:28.340
And...

52:29.370 --> 52:31.110
I will arrest all those bad guys

52:32.040 --> 52:34.650
and show you the world
is not that of a cruel place.

53:19.420 --> 53:20.830
That reminds me!

53:21.660 --> 53:22.990
Gosh, look at me.

53:23.060 --> 53:24.800
Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong must be waiting.

53:24.860 --> 53:25.900
I should get going.

53:25.960 --> 53:29.800
We need to find a tavern to stay in
before it gets too late.

53:29.870 --> 53:31.270
Well then.

53:31.800 --> 53:33.170
A tavern?

53:35.040 --> 53:36.240
A tavern?

53:37.140 --> 53:38.610
How could you even consider such a place?

53:38.740 --> 53:40.410
Who knows who will be in the next room?

53:41.080 --> 53:42.380
I will be fine.

53:42.480 --> 53:45.080
Why worry when I have
Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong?

53:47.520 --> 53:50.420
Do not be like that
and come back to my place.

53:57.800 --> 54:00.930
What I meant was
that there are many vacant rooms,

54:01.000 --> 54:02.300
so we can sleep together--

54:02.400 --> 54:03.500
Together?

54:04.800 --> 54:08.270
You will sleep in my room
while I sleep in your room...

54:08.740 --> 54:10.410
Why would I sleep in your room?

54:11.810 --> 54:15.080
I did not mean we should sleep together.
We will only spend the night...

54:15.480 --> 54:16.620
Spend the night?

54:17.920 --> 54:19.350
Out of the blue?

54:19.420 --> 54:22.150
Is this how you treated
all the women in your life?

54:22.520 --> 54:24.620
All the women in my life?

54:24.720 --> 54:27.690
I have never been with women before.
You are my first...

54:31.660 --> 54:32.800
Your first?

54:41.510 --> 54:42.570
Whatever!

54:44.580 --> 54:48.150
You cannot stay at a tavern indefinitely,

54:49.510 --> 54:50.750
so what will you do?

54:51.320 --> 54:52.520
According to Gwang-soon,

54:52.580 --> 54:55.320
the rent is affordable
over at Ohjeongdonggye.

54:55.390 --> 54:58.790
Wanderers like me can easily settle there.

54:59.060 --> 55:01.830
It is why I will visit
a real estate agency tomorrow.

55:00.530 --> 55:03.090
[Gageogan: real estate agency]

55:03.190 --> 55:04.300
Over there?

55:05.500 --> 55:07.630
Why must you make it harder on yourself?

55:09.600 --> 55:13.140
It is about time I found my independence.

55:21.910 --> 55:23.580
I know you too well

55:24.680 --> 55:26.050
to even think about stopping you.

55:26.580 --> 55:28.090
Always be cautious though.

55:28.490 --> 55:31.090
You are in Hanyang now.

55:33.430 --> 55:35.360
I really should get going now.

55:35.430 --> 55:37.930
Gwang-soon and Bi-ryeong
must be looking for me.

55:39.260 --> 55:41.370
Yuk-chil and Goo-pal
must be waiting for me too.

55:41.500 --> 55:43.700
Then, you should get going.

55:46.000 --> 55:48.570
Actually, let me escort you to them.

55:48.670 --> 55:49.770
Where were they?

55:51.110 --> 55:53.210
It is all right.
You should get going first.

55:53.310 --> 55:55.250
I can make it to them on my own.

55:55.550 --> 55:59.150
As if. How can you walk alone
at this late hour?

55:59.480 --> 56:01.590
-Allow me to walk you.
-They are not far from here,

56:01.690 --> 56:02.890
so please do not fret.

56:02.950 --> 56:04.260
I said I would walk you to them.

56:04.720 --> 56:06.860
-Lead the way.
-But I am fine.

56:06.930 --> 56:07.890
Lead the way.

56:07.960 --> 56:10.400
Having fun, are you?

56:14.600 --> 56:16.700
Do you not even care about us?

56:17.200 --> 56:18.700
How could you, my lord?

56:18.800 --> 56:20.570
How could you?

56:20.670 --> 56:24.140
You! Do you have any idea
how worried I was?

56:24.510 --> 56:27.410
I bet you did not even consider
that we would be worried sick.

56:31.020 --> 56:32.080
-Sorry.
-Sorry.

56:32.220 --> 56:34.220
-Unbelievable.
-But...

56:34.290 --> 56:35.320
Get over here.

56:35.390 --> 56:36.720
How could you?

56:36.820 --> 56:39.390
-Do you know how worried we were?
-Get over here!

56:39.520 --> 56:41.130
-How dare you!
-Hold on.

56:41.360 --> 56:43.600
How could you make us worry like that?

56:44.130 --> 56:47.630
Goodness.
My lord, I cannot believe you are alive.

56:58.640 --> 56:59.880
Stop that.

57:00.080 --> 57:02.880
♫ Ganggangsuwolrae ♫

57:03.050 --> 57:06.080
♫ Round and round we go ♫

57:06.150 --> 57:08.590
-♫ Ganggangsuwolrae ♫
-I am dizzy.

57:08.650 --> 57:10.060
♫ What a good day this is ♫

57:10.160 --> 57:13.590
Joseon must have found peace
while I was away.

57:13.760 --> 57:15.360
Once more!

57:21.170 --> 57:23.330
There we go. Yes!

57:33.710 --> 57:36.150
[Underage actors were managed with care.]

57:52.830 --> 57:54.570
[We thank Jo Kwan-woo and Cha Hak-yeon
for their special appearance.]

57:54.700 --> 57:57.440
[Secret Royal Inspector Joy]

57:58.070 --> 57:59.670
[We are off to make an arrest.]

57:59.940 --> 58:01.810
[An arrest? On whose authority?]

58:01.940 --> 58:04.980
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.
-Please reconsider, Your Majesty.

58:05.080 --> 58:06.180
[What now?]

58:06.240 --> 58:08.110
[How will you repay me?]

58:08.380 --> 58:09.280
He will have to die.

58:09.350 --> 58:11.020
[I knew it was you!]

58:11.080 --> 58:12.420
[Who said you could be this sweet?]

58:12.520 --> 58:15.120
[There must be a young lady
your heart beats faster for.]

58:15.220 --> 58:16.550
[But Inspector Ra...]

58:17.490 --> 58:18.820
[You're the secret royal inspector!]

58:18.960 --> 58:20.430
I am here to arrest you.

58:20.760 --> 58:23.330
[What are you trying to tell me?]

58:23.430 --> 58:25.260
[I will capture you this time.]
