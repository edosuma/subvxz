WEBVTT

00:08.182 --> 00:10.358
I was rummaging through
my toolbox the other day

00:10.401 --> 00:13.100
looking for a crescent wrench.

00:13.143 --> 00:14.623
I found an old engine part,

00:14.666 --> 00:17.974
reminded me of our first
road trip together as a couple.

00:19.976 --> 00:22.152
That was the day I knew.

00:24.328 --> 00:26.287
I mean, I knew
I loved you already, I knew...

00:26.330 --> 00:29.159
you had what it took
to be the wife of a cop.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.951
God, I miss you so much.

00:59.972 --> 01:01.452
<i>Hey!</i>

01:01.496 --> 01:04.107
We didn't get a chance
to talk at roll call.

01:04.151 --> 01:05.239
We're riding together.
I'm Eddie.

01:05.282 --> 01:07.154
Reagan?
Janko.

01:07.197 --> 01:08.807
Yeah, that's what it says
on your nameplate,

01:08.851 --> 01:10.157
but you're not fooling anybody.

01:10.200 --> 01:11.549
Well, I'm not trying to.

01:11.593 --> 01:13.334
You're married
to Sergeant Reagan,

01:13.377 --> 01:14.683
the PC is your daddy-in-law.

01:15.771 --> 01:17.642
- You got a problem with that?
- Nope.

01:17.686 --> 01:19.557
But maybe you do,
which is why you go by Janko.

01:20.906 --> 01:22.125
Luis Badillo.

01:22.169 --> 01:23.387
But you already
know about me,

01:23.431 --> 01:24.954
'cause I heard
you made calls asking.

01:24.997 --> 01:26.042
I did.

01:26.825 --> 01:27.913
I heard good stuff.

01:27.957 --> 01:29.872
Don't believe it.

01:30.873 --> 01:31.874
Did you already grab the keys?

01:31.917 --> 01:34.311
I did. I'll drive.

01:34.355 --> 01:36.922
29-David, you have a 10-30
at 460 Broadway.

01:36.966 --> 01:38.533
No further details at this time.

01:38.576 --> 01:40.361
Robbery in progress.
Let's roll.

01:40.404 --> 01:42.102
Are you gonna stand there
all day or you gonna get in?

01:43.364 --> 01:46.715
This trial is a witch hunt
by Erin Reagan,

01:46.758 --> 01:48.934
who she thinks she can do
whatever she pleases,

01:48.978 --> 01:51.372
including railroad my mother.

01:51.415 --> 01:53.374
But I am not
intimated by that.

01:53.417 --> 01:55.898
Erin Reagan has messed
with the wrong family.

01:55.941 --> 01:58.074
Keep moving.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.902
Ms. Harris,
one more question. Um...

01:59.945 --> 02:01.904
Oh, Ms. Reagan, uh,
do you care to comment

02:01.947 --> 02:03.253
on Leticia Harris's contention

02:03.297 --> 02:05.299
- that this trial is personal?
- No comment.

02:05.342 --> 02:07.344
Uh, you-- shouldn't have
you have recused yourself
from this case?

02:07.388 --> 02:08.389
No comment.

02:08.432 --> 02:09.520
Didn't you try to
recuse yourself?

02:09.564 --> 02:10.695
Yeah, and she objected.

02:10.739 --> 02:12.219
Well, now you know why.

02:12.262 --> 02:15.091
Move.

02:15.135 --> 02:16.832
Move. Go.

02:23.186 --> 02:24.970
Police!

02:28.496 --> 02:30.324
Clear!

02:35.372 --> 02:37.244
Somebody call 911?

02:37.287 --> 02:39.724
- Over here! Behind
the counter.

02:41.726 --> 02:42.858
Hey, hey.

02:42.901 --> 02:43.772
You got to help me.

02:44.860 --> 02:45.817
- Thank God you're here.
- Police!

02:45.861 --> 02:46.905
- Whoa.
- Don't move.

02:46.949 --> 02:47.776
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

02:47.819 --> 02:49.125
I'm the one who called 911.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.867
Ram Singh, I own the place.

02:51.910 --> 02:52.998
Well, then, who's this guy?

02:53.042 --> 02:54.565
He's the guy who
tried to rob me.

02:54.609 --> 02:56.176
And that-that's his gun.

02:56.219 --> 02:57.351
Do not go near that gun.

02:57.394 --> 02:58.656
- Yes, ma'am.
This guy's crazy!

02:58.700 --> 03:00.354
Just arrest me and get me
the hell out of here.

03:00.397 --> 03:02.007
How did he end up in cuffs?

03:02.051 --> 03:03.444
This guy comes in here
and pulls a gun on me,

03:03.487 --> 03:05.054
tells me to empty
my register.

03:05.097 --> 03:06.577
But one of my customers
had his own gun,

03:06.621 --> 03:09.145
and points it at
this scumbag, and says,

03:09.189 --> 03:11.278
"Be smart or be dead."

03:11.321 --> 03:14.455
He decided to be smart,
I guess, and we cuffed him.

03:14.498 --> 03:15.804
You just have cuffs?

03:15.847 --> 03:17.109
No, those were
the customer's, too.

03:17.153 --> 03:18.459
Yeah, who was
this customer?

03:18.502 --> 03:19.460
What's his name?

03:19.503 --> 03:21.244
"Good Samaritan."

03:22.289 --> 03:23.420
You don't have a name?

03:23.464 --> 03:25.814
He asked to be anonymous.

03:25.857 --> 03:27.119
We're gonna have to insist
that you give us a name

03:27.163 --> 03:28.295
or a description.

03:28.338 --> 03:29.513
No can do.

03:29.557 --> 03:31.123
Look, he just saved me
from getting robbed.

03:31.167 --> 03:32.168
Maybe even saved my life.

03:32.212 --> 03:33.300
Yeah, well,
we're gonna need to look

03:33.343 --> 03:34.866
at your security footage.

03:34.910 --> 03:36.346
I don't have any.

03:36.390 --> 03:37.478
You have cameras.

03:37.521 --> 03:38.870
They're not operational.

03:39.871 --> 03:41.525
Apparently,
he was on his way home

03:41.569 --> 03:43.310
from the gym, got coldcocked.

03:43.353 --> 03:44.659
The perp stomped him pretty bad

03:44.702 --> 03:45.834
out on the street,
broad daylight.

03:45.877 --> 03:47.052
Any witnesses?

03:47.096 --> 03:48.358
They were all looking
the other way

03:48.402 --> 03:50.491
as he got his arm broken
and a couple ribs.

03:50.534 --> 03:51.970
You get a description?

03:52.014 --> 03:53.929
Nothing yet.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.279
Okay, I want a team on this.

03:56.323 --> 03:58.412
Check all the surveillance
cameras in the area.

03:58.455 --> 04:00.240
You got it, boss.

04:20.695 --> 04:24.046
Well, I'm not gonna ask you
how you're doing.

04:24.089 --> 04:25.482
I'm fine.

04:25.526 --> 04:28.050
They're not even gonna
keep me overnight.

04:28.093 --> 04:29.747
Did you get a look at the guy?

04:31.488 --> 04:32.620
No.

04:32.663 --> 04:34.317
Nothing?

04:34.361 --> 04:35.884
Nothing.

04:38.713 --> 04:40.192
You're a good cop, Joe.

04:40.236 --> 04:42.891
I expect more than just,
"Gee, it all happened so fast."

04:42.934 --> 04:45.067
He blindsided me.

04:45.110 --> 04:47.330
It was probably just some guy
who hates cops.

04:47.374 --> 04:52.553
Or one particular cop.

04:52.596 --> 04:55.077
By a collar
with an axe to grind?

04:55.120 --> 04:58.515
Well, that's a long
damn list, so...

04:58.559 --> 05:01.301
Well, we've got time.
I'm putting a team together.

05:03.390 --> 05:04.608
I'd rather not.

05:08.656 --> 05:11.093
You'd rather not
find out who did this?

05:11.136 --> 05:13.008
I'd rather you not send it up
the food chain,

05:13.051 --> 05:15.315
and have your office
release it to the press.

05:15.358 --> 05:16.620
That's not gonna happen.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.230
And I'd rather
the family not know.

05:20.407 --> 05:22.104
Do me a solid, okay?

05:22.147 --> 05:26.369
Just pretend I'm-I'm one
of the 35,000 other cops,

05:26.413 --> 05:30.199
95% of whom, uh,
tussle with a perp, and...

05:40.992 --> 05:45.170
Danny. You recognize this woman?

05:45.214 --> 05:48.348
No. Never saw her
before in my life.

05:48.391 --> 05:49.958
She was arrested a
couple hours ago.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.307
Officer found a ghost
gun with a silencer

05:51.351 --> 05:52.439
in her glove compartment.

05:52.482 --> 05:53.788
And you came all the way
down here

05:53.831 --> 05:55.137
to tell me that because...

05:55.180 --> 05:57.792
She was gonna use it
to kill a cop.

05:57.835 --> 06:00.229
Okay, well,
thank God she didn't.

06:00.272 --> 06:01.796
What does that have
to do with me?

06:01.839 --> 06:04.799
You're the cop
she was supposed to kill.

06:32.566 --> 06:34.698
How do we even know
this is legit?

06:34.742 --> 06:36.134
Maybe she's some loony tune

06:36.178 --> 06:38.267
who got my name
off the news or something.

06:38.310 --> 06:41.009
Did you happen to visit Linda
at the cemetery this morning?

06:41.052 --> 06:42.358
She was there?

06:42.402 --> 06:44.099
Elena Marquez.

06:44.142 --> 06:45.274
Your would-be
assassin.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.536
Says she came within
20, 30 feet of you,

06:46.580 --> 06:48.190
gun aimed at your back.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.671
What was her motive?

06:50.714 --> 06:52.890
More importantly, why didn't
she go through with it?

06:52.934 --> 06:54.936
She clammed up pretty tight
when we started digging in.

06:54.979 --> 06:57.155
Figured maybe you could
get it out of her.

06:57.199 --> 06:58.983
I will.

06:59.027 --> 07:01.116
Okay, I got it from here.

07:01.159 --> 07:04.206
Danny, that's not
how this one's gonna go.

07:04.249 --> 07:06.556
Well, how is this one gonna go?

07:06.600 --> 07:08.515
I'm gonna be with you on this
until it rides into the sunset.

07:08.558 --> 07:10.778
No, you're not. Thanks anyway.

07:10.821 --> 07:12.257
Please just take the help.
It's mandatory.

07:12.301 --> 07:14.477
Who assigned you to babysit me?

07:14.521 --> 07:16.044
Lieutenant Gormley.
Said he doesn't want to take it

07:16.087 --> 07:17.480
to the PC,
but he will if you refuse.

07:17.524 --> 07:18.655
And you just went along with it?

07:18.699 --> 07:20.440
I'm just following orders
and doing my job.

07:20.483 --> 07:23.007
Uh-huh. Story of your life,
Saint Jameson.

07:23.051 --> 07:24.269
Let's go.

07:30.537 --> 07:33.365
We ID'd the attacker.

07:33.409 --> 07:35.411
We got footage from
the laundromat on the corner,

07:35.455 --> 07:38.806
enhanced it and sent it
through facial recognition.

07:38.849 --> 07:40.329
Perp's name
is Javier Estevez,

07:40.372 --> 07:43.288
25, from East New York.

07:43.332 --> 07:45.595
His rap sheet's like
a roll of toilet paper.

07:45.639 --> 07:48.380
Last charge was
attempted murder.

07:50.382 --> 07:53.211
And the arresting officer...

07:55.170 --> 07:56.693
...Detective Joe Hill.

07:58.129 --> 08:02.351
Who testified against Estevez
on that charge in 2017,

08:02.394 --> 08:05.702
was found guilty
and sentenced to four years.

08:06.921 --> 08:09.053
And now he's looking
for revenge.

08:12.100 --> 08:13.318
Yeah.

08:16.017 --> 08:18.236
The serial number's
on the face of the cuff's body

08:18.280 --> 08:19.542
above the keyhole.

08:19.586 --> 08:22.197
That's right,
ending in 1-3-2-2.

08:22.240 --> 08:23.764
Yeah, I'll hold.

08:23.807 --> 08:25.113
What are you doing?

08:25.156 --> 08:26.723
Finding out who
owns these cuffs.

08:26.767 --> 08:28.072
Why?

08:28.116 --> 08:29.900
'Cause they were
involved in a robbery.

08:29.944 --> 08:30.988
No, they belong
to the Good Samaritan,

08:31.032 --> 08:32.337
who wants to remain anonymous.

08:32.381 --> 08:33.991
I like to be thorough.

08:34.035 --> 08:35.123
Is that what you call this?

08:35.166 --> 08:36.864
Excuse me?

08:36.907 --> 08:38.256
The perp is arrested.

08:38.300 --> 08:39.954
It was an easy collar,
end of story.

08:39.997 --> 08:41.738
Let's go get some real collars.

08:41.782 --> 08:44.219
Well, this Good Samaritan
stepped up to prevent a robbery.

08:44.262 --> 08:47.439
I think he deserves thanks.
And he was an eyewitness.

08:47.483 --> 08:49.529
He deserves what he asked for.
To be anonymous.

08:49.572 --> 08:50.704
And there might be
a good reason.

08:50.747 --> 08:52.488
- You ever think that?
- Yes.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.273
Oh, okay. Are you sure?

08:55.317 --> 08:56.797
Thanks.

08:58.755 --> 09:00.670
The serial number's from a batch

09:00.714 --> 09:02.542
that were sold to the NYPD.

09:02.585 --> 09:04.544
So, our Good Samaritan
is an off-duty cop,

09:04.587 --> 09:06.894
which is exactly why
he wants to remain anonymous.

09:08.983 --> 09:12.290
And were there any fingerprints
on the murder weapon?

09:12.334 --> 09:15.424
Yes, there were two prints
of value lifted from the gun.

09:15.467 --> 09:17.600
And did they
match anyone?

09:17.644 --> 09:20.995
The prints were a match, uh,
to the defendant Sandra Harris.

09:21.038 --> 09:22.997
Thank you.

09:23.040 --> 09:26.653
Do those fingerprints
that match my mother's,

09:26.696 --> 09:30.657
do they prove
that she killed Reggie Lewis?

09:30.700 --> 09:31.701
Well, it doesn't work that way.

09:31.745 --> 09:32.876
Yes or no?

09:32.920 --> 09:34.748
Does the match prove

09:34.791 --> 09:37.098
that Sandra Harris
killed Reggie Lewis?

09:37.141 --> 09:38.839
- Well, no.
- Isn't it possible

09:38.882 --> 09:41.755
that the gun belonged to
Mr. Lewis, and the only reason

09:41.798 --> 09:44.105
that my mother's prints
are on the gun

09:44.148 --> 09:46.194
is because he showed it to her?

09:46.237 --> 09:48.196
Objection. Speculation.

09:48.239 --> 09:49.676
Overruled.

09:49.719 --> 09:51.068
Is it possible?

09:51.112 --> 09:54.637
Well, yes, it's possible,
but unlikely.

09:54.681 --> 09:56.204
That's all, Detective.

09:56.247 --> 09:58.336
Detective Abetamarco,

09:58.380 --> 10:00.774
was there
any evidence whatsoever

10:00.817 --> 10:04.081
that Reggie Lewis
ever possessed that weapon?

10:04.125 --> 10:05.300
None.

10:05.343 --> 10:07.476
And why do you believe
that Sandra Harris

10:07.519 --> 10:10.827
possessed the gun that shot
and killed Reggie Lewis?

10:10.871 --> 10:13.221
Because we found a witness
that saw the whole thing.

10:13.264 --> 10:17.051
Thank you. No further questions.

10:18.574 --> 10:20.141
Why didn't you come
forward at the time?

10:20.184 --> 10:21.664
I've already gone through this.

10:21.708 --> 10:23.753
Leticia Harris is going
to poke holes

10:23.797 --> 10:25.407
into the reason why
you waited so long.

10:25.450 --> 10:29.150
I can't change how long
I waited, Erin.

10:29.193 --> 10:30.238
Are you done
prepping me?

10:30.281 --> 10:31.587
Anything else
you want to discuss?

10:31.631 --> 10:33.110
I guess not.

10:33.154 --> 10:36.026
And I can't discuss this case
with you until it's over.

10:36.070 --> 10:38.246
Which can't be soon
enough for me.

10:39.943 --> 10:41.597
What is that supposed to mean?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.774
It means I'm tired, Erin.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.429
I've been in the
headlines for days

10:47.472 --> 10:49.344
because of this trial.

10:49.387 --> 10:50.911
That was not my intention.

10:50.954 --> 10:52.956
Right. You had good intentions,

10:53.000 --> 10:56.481
which, in the Reagan playbook
makes it all okay.

11:00.268 --> 11:02.574
- It doesn't
add up, Elena.

11:02.618 --> 11:05.534
You were hired to do the job,
why didn't you pull the trigger?

11:05.577 --> 11:08.798
Shooting you in the back?
Where's the honor in that?

11:08.842 --> 11:11.627
- Honor? Last
time I checked,

11:11.671 --> 11:14.717
wasting a cop like me would be a
grand slam for someone like you.

11:14.761 --> 11:17.415
And nobody would care
if you corked your bat.

11:17.459 --> 11:19.722
You're right, Detective.

11:19.766 --> 11:21.811
The whole life
isn't sitting right anymore.

11:21.855 --> 11:24.553
So why the change of heart?
Why didn't you pull the trigger?

11:24.596 --> 11:27.121
- I need a reason?
- You're damn right
you need a reason!

11:27.164 --> 11:29.079
- In here,

11:29.123 --> 11:31.081
you want a deal, you got
to tell us the whole truth.

11:31.125 --> 11:32.256
Otherwise you're
looking at one to four

11:32.300 --> 11:33.736
for felony criminal possession.

11:33.780 --> 11:34.868
I can't go to prison.

11:34.911 --> 11:36.521
Well, that's exactly where

11:36.565 --> 11:38.436
you're gonna go if you're
not straight with us.

11:42.005 --> 11:43.441
I'm pregnant, okay?

11:43.485 --> 11:45.356
It's one thing
to choose

11:45.400 --> 11:47.881
this life for myself,
but for an innocent child?

11:49.230 --> 11:51.536
So you found out

11:51.580 --> 11:53.408
you were expecting,
had a change of heart,

11:53.451 --> 11:55.279
then wanted to be let go?

11:55.323 --> 11:59.153
Yeah. So I could
walk a straight line.

11:59.196 --> 12:01.068
Do the right thing.

12:01.111 --> 12:02.547
But first you had to make good
on a severance agreement?

12:02.591 --> 12:04.288
The people I run with?

12:04.332 --> 12:05.681
Leaving them is a little harder

12:05.725 --> 12:07.204
than switching
cell phone providers.

12:07.248 --> 12:09.250
So they named
their price.

12:09.293 --> 12:11.382
Your freedom
for the life of a cop.

12:13.428 --> 12:16.257
My freedom for <i>your</i> life,
Detective.

12:16.300 --> 12:17.911
My life.

12:17.954 --> 12:19.347
Specifically.

12:19.390 --> 12:20.957
Who the hell are these
people you're running with?

12:23.655 --> 12:26.006
Mano Sangriento.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.626
Who ordered the hit?

12:37.669 --> 12:38.888
His name is Arturo Muñoz.

12:40.281 --> 12:42.674
They call him La Nieve.
"The Snow."

12:42.718 --> 12:45.155
Let me guess.
For his warm, sunny personality?

12:45.199 --> 12:47.767
And since I didn't have it
in me to finish the job,

12:47.810 --> 12:49.638
another hit could be
around the corner.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.074
For either of us.

12:51.118 --> 12:52.859
Elena, this is up to you.

12:52.902 --> 12:54.382
You're gonna help us
take down Muñoz.

12:54.425 --> 12:55.557
And if I don't?

12:55.600 --> 12:57.124
If you don't,

12:57.167 --> 12:59.256
then the first thing
your child will ever see

12:59.300 --> 13:00.910
is the inside of the infirmary

13:00.954 --> 13:02.869
at Bayview Correctional
Facility.

13:17.884 --> 13:21.888
Brought you your favorite
breakfast, bagels from Zabar's.

13:26.893 --> 13:29.112
You want to come in?

13:31.158 --> 13:33.900
Well, I'd like to, yeah.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.685
Okay.

13:38.165 --> 13:40.384
Thanks.

13:45.694 --> 13:47.739
How'd you know?
About the bagels?

13:47.783 --> 13:50.133
Full disclosure,
I asked your mom.

13:50.177 --> 13:52.048
Nice place.

14:00.970 --> 14:04.452
That's the day I graduated
from the academy.

14:04.495 --> 14:07.368
Uh, the one with my mom
is-is Cape Cod.

14:09.892 --> 14:12.025
I don't have any photos
of my dad, so...

14:14.723 --> 14:17.900
But you are like him
in so many ways.

14:20.990 --> 14:22.557
Yeah, I wouldn't know.

14:24.951 --> 14:26.169
May I?

14:41.315 --> 14:42.925
Okay.

14:46.711 --> 14:49.584
You said you didn't see
the perp, but it turns out

14:49.627 --> 14:52.717
it's someone you arrested
and testified against.

14:54.676 --> 14:56.286
But then, you know that.

14:58.419 --> 14:59.899
So what are you saying?
I'm lying?

14:59.942 --> 15:01.378
Well, I'm thinking

15:01.422 --> 15:03.903
you think you can deal
with this yourself.

15:03.946 --> 15:06.340
I can, and I will deal
with it myself.

15:06.383 --> 15:08.385
I hope you're not talking
about street justice.

15:08.429 --> 15:10.300
I didn't say that.

15:10.344 --> 15:11.562
Then what?

15:12.563 --> 15:14.174
What do you want from me here?

15:14.217 --> 15:16.567
What do I want from you? I want
you to do this by the book.

15:16.611 --> 15:19.788
Go in, make a positive ID
and let us handle it.

15:19.831 --> 15:22.530
And be the dumbass cop
who got jumped by a street thug

15:22.573 --> 15:24.749
and then had my ass
handed to me on a platter?

15:24.793 --> 15:26.708
- No, thanks.
- Joe, you're a cop,

15:26.751 --> 15:28.362
- not a vigilante.
- You're kidding me.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.669
Even if I do testify,
the guy is gonna get out.

15:31.713 --> 15:34.063
I-I feel like every collar
I make these days,

15:34.107 --> 15:36.631
the guy gets out before
I can even finish the paperwork.

15:37.893 --> 15:39.416
And what's your justice?

15:41.070 --> 15:42.724
I don't know,
but it's a hell of a lot better

15:42.767 --> 15:44.117
than what you're offering.

15:46.075 --> 15:50.166
Maybe you need to ask yourself
what kind of cop you want to be.

15:51.167 --> 15:52.777
I know what kind of cop I am.

15:52.821 --> 15:54.170
A proactive one.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.912
And it's not because of you,
or my dad,

15:56.956 --> 15:59.610
and I don't need you coming here
telling me what to do.

16:08.054 --> 16:10.056
Maybe you do.

16:27.073 --> 16:28.813
Where the hell are you?

16:28.857 --> 16:30.902
Danny, I'm back here!

16:34.428 --> 16:36.212
What the hell are you doing?

16:36.256 --> 16:37.387
What?

16:37.431 --> 16:39.520
What? You got Kevlar curtains

16:39.563 --> 16:43.002
on my windows, unmarked cars
on each end of the block. Why?

16:43.045 --> 16:43.872
Protecting you.

16:43.915 --> 16:44.960
- Protecting me?
- Yeah.

16:45.004 --> 16:46.831
By camping out in my bedroom?

16:46.875 --> 16:48.268
One can never be too safe.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.226
Yes, one can be too safe,

16:50.270 --> 16:52.054
and that's exactly what
you're being right now.

16:52.098 --> 16:52.968
You need to stop.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.361
After we nail Muñoz.

16:54.404 --> 16:56.015
- Do you want to watch a movie?
- No.

16:56.058 --> 16:57.886
Because I brought one of
your favorites. <i>The Verdict.</i>

16:57.929 --> 17:01.063
Oh, great.
I'll go make some popcorn.

17:01.107 --> 17:02.151
You're a pain in the ass.

17:02.195 --> 17:03.805
No, <i>you're</i> a pain in the ass.

17:03.848 --> 17:05.850
You're welcome!

17:11.856 --> 17:13.249
Hi, Henry.

17:13.293 --> 17:14.729
Hi, yourself.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.339
Jamie with you?

17:16.383 --> 17:18.602
No, he's doing a double.

17:18.646 --> 17:21.344
Oh. Francis isn't home yet.

17:21.388 --> 17:23.346
Uh, it's you I came to see.

17:23.390 --> 17:26.610
Oh. Can I get you a cup of tea?
Or a drink?

17:26.654 --> 17:27.785
Uh, no.

17:27.829 --> 17:32.051
I came to return these.

17:35.532 --> 17:37.969
I believe they're yours.

17:38.013 --> 17:42.235
The NYPD purchased
those in 1971,

17:42.278 --> 17:44.715
and they
assigned them

17:44.759 --> 17:48.806
to Detective Henry Reagan
of the warrant squad.

17:48.850 --> 17:50.547
So?

17:50.591 --> 17:53.768
So what are you doing running
around with cuffs and a gun?

17:53.811 --> 17:57.032
I have a full carry permit.
Do you need to see it?

17:57.076 --> 17:58.599
That's not what I'm saying.

17:58.642 --> 18:02.255
And if you carry a gun, you
should also have cuffs, too.

18:02.298 --> 18:04.518
I'm glad I did.
They came in handy.

18:04.561 --> 18:06.041
What are you doing
running around trying to stop

18:06.085 --> 18:07.521
a criminal
who could've killed you?

18:07.564 --> 18:09.566
I was doing what
any cop would do.

18:09.610 --> 18:12.221
I need you to promise me
that you will not do that again.

18:12.265 --> 18:15.877
Eddie.

18:15.920 --> 18:20.316
I was arresting people
before you were born.

18:20.360 --> 18:23.580
I'm too old
and too experienced to have you

18:23.624 --> 18:28.194
or anyone else in this family
tell me what to do.

18:28.237 --> 18:31.197
This conversation
is over.

18:31.240 --> 18:33.329
The only thing I need
from you is a promise

18:33.373 --> 18:35.897
that you won't tell
the rest of the family.

18:35.940 --> 18:38.682
I don't want to embarrass Frank.

18:38.726 --> 18:42.773
Now, if you'll excuse me.

18:45.646 --> 18:48.779
Apparently, the guy
who's trying to kill you

18:48.823 --> 18:50.129
is Arturo Muñoz.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.782
He took over
Mano Sangriento

18:51.826 --> 18:53.349
after we cleaned house

18:53.393 --> 18:55.046
and arrested José Rojas.

18:55.090 --> 18:57.745
Apparently Rojas was his uncle.

18:57.788 --> 18:59.573
No wonder why
it's personal for him.

18:59.616 --> 19:00.661
But if we can use Elena
to get him

19:00.704 --> 19:02.053
to admit to ordering the hit,

19:02.097 --> 19:03.968
then that's conspiracy
to commit murder.

19:04.012 --> 19:05.753
- You want to
send her in

19:05.796 --> 19:08.234
to talk to him wearing a wire?

19:08.277 --> 19:10.279
- Yeah.
- Just like that.

19:10.323 --> 19:13.848
You don't become the leader of
Mano Sangriento by being stupid.

19:13.891 --> 19:17.112
This guy's not just gonna admit
that he ordered the execution.

19:17.156 --> 19:19.506
Not unless he thinks Elena
really went through with it.

19:27.557 --> 19:29.168
Let's get a little more blood.

19:30.169 --> 19:31.474
I like this look for you.

19:31.518 --> 19:32.649
Maybe you can get one
with me in it?

19:32.693 --> 19:33.824
This would make
a good Christmas card.

19:33.868 --> 19:35.304
- Very funny.
What on earth

19:35.348 --> 19:37.350
could have inspired you
to come up with this idea?

19:37.393 --> 19:38.699
Can we just see

19:38.742 --> 19:40.527
if the pictures
look good already?

19:40.570 --> 19:42.006
Been laying
here all day.

19:42.050 --> 19:43.747
A little too real,
if you ask me.

19:43.791 --> 19:45.358
You think Muñoz is gonna buy it?

19:45.401 --> 19:47.142
They don't have to be perfect.

19:47.186 --> 19:49.100
Just have to buy Elena
some time with Muñoz.

19:49.144 --> 19:50.798
You think this girl
is trustworthy?

19:50.841 --> 19:53.017
She could be leading us
to a death trap.

19:53.061 --> 19:54.105
This is his idea, not mine.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.151
Muñoz texted
Elena's phone.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.283
- He wants to meet.
- Great.

19:57.326 --> 19:59.110
Let's get a wire on her
forthwith

19:59.154 --> 20:01.417
and get that son of a bitch
and his cartel off my back.

20:01.461 --> 20:03.419
And get the human buzz saw
out of my bedroom.

20:03.463 --> 20:05.943
Nobody will be happier than me
when this is over, all right?

20:05.987 --> 20:11.340
Has Erin Reagan ever expressed
interest in becoming the D.A.?

20:11.384 --> 20:14.169
Objection, Your Honor.
I am not the one on trial here.

20:14.213 --> 20:17.477
If you will allow me,
I believe A.D.A. Reagan

20:17.520 --> 20:21.263
wants her boss's job, so
exposing her boss on the stand

20:21.307 --> 20:23.396
is the real reason
why we are here.

20:23.439 --> 20:24.614
- Your Honor.
- My client

20:24.658 --> 20:27.269
is on trial for a murder
she didn't commit,

20:27.313 --> 20:29.445
and the jury deserves
to hear that.

20:29.489 --> 20:31.099
I'll allow.

20:37.410 --> 20:39.890
Has Ms. Reagan
expressed interest

20:39.934 --> 20:42.371
in Kimberly Crawford's job?

20:42.415 --> 20:44.199
Well, it's the natural
progression.

20:44.243 --> 20:46.506
Yes or no?

20:46.549 --> 20:49.073
Has she expressed interest?

20:49.117 --> 20:50.597
Yes.

20:54.644 --> 20:56.429
No further questions.

21:06.874 --> 21:09.485
We got a tip that the perp
who attacked Detective Hill

21:09.529 --> 21:11.748
is holed up in a safe house
in the Bronx.

21:11.792 --> 21:14.577
I can send ESU
to collar him.

21:14.621 --> 21:16.666
No, have them sit on the place.

21:16.710 --> 21:17.841
To what end?

21:17.885 --> 21:19.060
Well, he's got to come out
sometime.

21:19.103 --> 21:21.584
When he does, pick him up.

21:21.628 --> 21:22.542
Why wait?

21:22.585 --> 21:24.021
Because if he has a gun on him,

21:24.065 --> 21:26.981
and a felony to his name,
he can be charged federally.

21:28.504 --> 21:30.854
And he won't be subject
to bail reform.

21:30.898 --> 21:32.116
That's pretty smart.

21:32.160 --> 21:34.249
Thank you.

21:34.293 --> 21:35.990
I think that's why
he's the boss.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.339
Let me get on this.

21:46.130 --> 21:47.349
Detective Hill.

21:50.309 --> 21:53.790
Lieutenant Gormley. Call me Sid.

21:53.834 --> 21:56.053
- It's nice to meet you.
- Yeah.

21:56.097 --> 21:57.533
Heard a lot about you.

21:57.577 --> 21:58.665
All good, I hope.

21:58.708 --> 22:01.363
Detective Hill?

22:02.756 --> 22:04.323
- Yeah.

22:23.429 --> 22:24.560
I didn't ask you to sit.

22:32.263 --> 22:34.222
But stand easy.

22:37.443 --> 22:40.228
I hope this isn't
about the incident.

22:41.447 --> 22:43.318
The incident
where someone broke your arm

22:43.362 --> 22:46.974
and a couple of ribs and
affected your short-term memory?

22:48.889 --> 22:51.065
Make no mistake,
we're gonna get the guy

22:51.108 --> 22:53.372
whether you cooperate or not.

22:54.721 --> 22:56.200
Then, why am I here?

22:56.244 --> 22:58.768
We are close to arresting
the perp.

22:58.812 --> 23:01.510
When we do, you will be
summoned for a lineup,

23:01.554 --> 23:04.774
at which point,
should you recognize him,

23:04.818 --> 23:07.386
you will be asked
to answer any question

23:07.429 --> 23:09.649
posed to you by the supervisor.

23:11.607 --> 23:13.174
And if I choose not to?

23:13.217 --> 23:16.438
Failure to do so will result
in your suspension

23:16.482 --> 23:19.180
and surrender
of your gun and shield.

23:20.311 --> 23:23.010
Are you trying
to strong-arm me here?

23:24.446 --> 23:26.970
Be pretty easy,
the shape you're in.

23:29.930 --> 23:32.628
I seem to recall
you asking to be treated

23:32.672 --> 23:36.937
like the 35,000 other cops
on the job.

23:36.980 --> 23:40.201
Well, you got it.

23:40.244 --> 23:41.768
Dismissed.

24:05.705 --> 24:09.404
She was facing Reggie Lewis
when she pulled the trigger.

24:09.448 --> 24:11.885
And when Reggie Lewis
dropped to the ground?

24:11.928 --> 24:16.498
She put the gun back in her bag,
turned around and left.

24:16.542 --> 24:18.631
Did she check to see
if he was dead?

24:18.674 --> 24:21.547
No.
Did she call 911?

24:21.590 --> 24:22.635
No.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.071
Can you point out the person

24:24.114 --> 24:27.422
you saw murder Reggie Lewis?

24:29.816 --> 24:31.295
That's her right there.

24:31.339 --> 24:33.472
Sandra Harris.

24:33.515 --> 24:35.735
Let the record reflect

24:35.778 --> 24:39.303
that the witness identified
the defendant Sandra Harris

24:39.347 --> 24:42.611
as the person who murdered
Reggie Lewis.

24:42.655 --> 24:45.396
Thank you.
No further questions.

24:45.440 --> 24:49.313
So, you saw this murder
30 years ago?

24:49.357 --> 24:51.098
That's right.

24:51.141 --> 24:53.840
And how did you decide
to come forward

24:53.883 --> 24:57.670
after sitting on this secret
for 30 years?

24:57.713 --> 25:00.194
I mentioned the murder
during a witness interview

25:00.237 --> 25:02.631
on a case I was working
with A.D.A. Reagan.

25:02.675 --> 25:04.764
I said I saw
a murder,

25:04.807 --> 25:07.680
but never came forward at the
time, and that I regretted it.

25:07.723 --> 25:09.420
And what did she say?

25:09.464 --> 25:10.639
She said we should
reopen the case.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.467
Hmm. And how did you respond?

25:12.511 --> 25:14.513
Objection. Relevance.

25:14.556 --> 25:16.732
Your Honor, if you will
allow me to continue,

25:16.776 --> 25:18.560
you will see
the relevance.

25:18.604 --> 25:19.909
I'll allow.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.651
What did you say

25:22.695 --> 25:24.392
to A.D.A. Reagan

25:24.435 --> 25:27.264
when she said that she'd like
to open the case?

25:27.308 --> 25:29.571
I responded by saying I lied.

25:31.094 --> 25:33.140
That I never really saw
the murder.

25:33.183 --> 25:34.576
You said

25:34.620 --> 25:36.317
that you never

25:36.360 --> 25:37.840
really saw
the murder?

25:37.884 --> 25:39.189
Objection.

25:39.233 --> 25:41.714
- Asked and answered.
- Overruled.

25:41.757 --> 25:44.194
- You said you didn't
see the murder.

25:44.238 --> 25:47.371
Now you're saying you did see
the murder. Which is it?

25:47.415 --> 25:49.852
Were you lying then
or are you lying now?

25:49.896 --> 25:51.158
I did see the murder.

25:51.201 --> 25:53.726
I mean, that's a...

25:53.769 --> 25:55.815
That's some serious
flip-flopping.

25:55.858 --> 26:01.603
And yet, Erin Reagan
still opened the case.

26:01.647 --> 26:03.300
Is it possible
that Erin Reagan

26:03.344 --> 26:05.868
opened this case

26:05.912 --> 26:06.956
because she wants your job?

26:07.000 --> 26:08.697
Objection, Your Honor.

26:08.741 --> 26:10.960
- I'll allow.
Did you ever consider

26:11.004 --> 26:14.268
that A.D.A. Reagan
opened this case

26:14.311 --> 26:17.619
to discredit you
because she wants your job?

26:17.663 --> 26:18.794
Object... Yes.

26:25.322 --> 26:27.368
No further questions.

26:35.463 --> 26:37.596
Everything you need
is on your phone.

26:37.639 --> 26:39.162
It's like having an open line.

26:39.206 --> 26:41.512
So, you'll hear
- everything we say?
Everything.

26:41.556 --> 26:44.167
All you got to do is get Muñoz
to admit that he ordered the hit

26:44.211 --> 26:47.431
on me in exchange for your
freedom from Mano Sangriento.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.129
- The hit of
Detective Reagan

26:49.172 --> 26:50.739
is in your photos.

26:53.481 --> 26:56.397
You can show that to Muñoz as
proof that you carried it out.

26:56.440 --> 26:58.355
- And once he
acknowledges that,

26:58.399 --> 26:59.356
it's all over.

26:59.400 --> 27:00.662
What if something goes wrong?

27:00.706 --> 27:03.012
What if he thinks
something's up?

27:03.056 --> 27:05.449
You can use a phrase to signal
to us that you need help.

27:05.493 --> 27:06.929
Like "I don't feel well"?

27:06.973 --> 27:07.669
Just like that.

27:07.713 --> 27:08.670
It's not really a lie.

27:08.714 --> 27:09.889
Are you okay?

27:09.932 --> 27:12.195
Yeah, I'm okay, it's just...

27:12.239 --> 27:14.328
everything's different now.

27:14.371 --> 27:17.287
Now it's not just me
I'm putting in danger.

27:17.331 --> 27:20.290
- If this goes smoothly, you'll
go into witness protection.

27:20.334 --> 27:22.336
You can start a new life.

27:25.600 --> 27:26.775
For both of you.

27:36.916 --> 27:39.396
Can I have another slice of pie?

27:39.440 --> 27:41.094
Gonna be your second dessert.

27:41.137 --> 27:42.225
What does that mean?

27:42.269 --> 27:43.705
Why are you drowning
your sorrows in pie?

27:43.749 --> 27:45.098
Clearly you're not
up to date

27:45.141 --> 27:46.708
on how my trial
is being characterized

27:46.752 --> 27:48.667
as a catfight
between me and my boss.

27:48.710 --> 27:50.016
Ooh, is it? A catfight?

27:50.059 --> 27:52.105
No. Whoever said

27:52.148 --> 27:55.674
no good deed goes unpunished
was smart as hell.

27:55.717 --> 27:58.415
- Amen to that. You
try helping people,

27:58.459 --> 28:01.418
you end up on trial yourself.

28:01.549 --> 28:02.724
Couldn't have said it better
myself, Pop.

28:02.768 --> 28:04.813
Well, maybe if people
were honest

28:04.857 --> 28:06.641
and up-front about things,
they wouldn't worry

28:06.685 --> 28:10.079
about having things come out
that shouldn't come out.

28:10.123 --> 28:12.255
Are you calling
Aunt Erin dishonest?

28:12.299 --> 28:14.736
No. I'm just saying
keeping secrets,

28:14.780 --> 28:18.087
like the D.A. did, and like
other people do, can backfire.

28:18.131 --> 28:20.263
Well, that depends
on the reason

28:20.307 --> 28:22.483
for keeping the secret
in the first place.

28:22.526 --> 28:25.007
- Exactly.
Sometimes you don't
get rewarded for doing

28:25.051 --> 28:26.922
the right thing, you end up
catching nothing but grief.

28:26.966 --> 28:28.576
- And sometimes
some people

28:28.619 --> 28:30.447
should just stay out of other
people's business.

28:30.491 --> 28:31.797
- Well, I wish I
had done that

28:31.840 --> 28:33.276
instead of reopening this case.

28:33.320 --> 28:37.063
I got to say, you all sound
so whiney today.

28:37.106 --> 28:38.151
What are you talking about?

28:38.194 --> 28:39.152
I'm not whining.
That's Danny's job.

28:39.195 --> 28:40.631
I'm venting, not whining.

28:40.675 --> 28:43.112
Come on, everybody's complaining
about getting involved

28:43.156 --> 28:45.245
in something they say
they shouldn't have.

28:45.288 --> 28:47.551
- What's wrong with that?
- I don't think there's
anything wrong with it.

28:47.595 --> 28:50.250
What's the alternative?
Sitting on the sidelines?

28:50.293 --> 28:52.469
Is that what everybody
wished they'd done instead?

28:52.513 --> 28:53.993
Not me.

28:54.036 --> 28:55.646
Or me.
Or me. I just wish

28:55.690 --> 28:57.431
someone else would've
stayed on the sidelines.

28:57.474 --> 28:58.737
I think I wish I had.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.042
Yeah, me, too.

29:00.086 --> 29:01.261
I'm working
that Good Samaritan case.

29:01.304 --> 29:02.566
What's there to work?

29:02.610 --> 29:04.438
Give the guy a medal,
end of story.

29:04.481 --> 29:05.831
I agree completely.

29:05.874 --> 29:07.093
Yeah.

29:08.050 --> 29:09.704
Bottom line,

29:09.748 --> 29:13.142
sitting on the sidelines
is not in this family's DNA.

29:16.058 --> 29:17.625
Which means it's all your fault.

29:18.757 --> 29:20.802
Which means it's your fault.

30:01.669 --> 30:02.975
MUÑ Long time no see.

30:03.018 --> 30:04.367
You get into trouble
or something?

30:05.891 --> 30:07.806
Did you want the hit done fast,

30:07.849 --> 30:09.720
or did you want it done right?

30:23.734 --> 30:24.910
<i>OÓrale.</i>

30:24.953 --> 30:26.346
I did what
you wanted.

30:26.389 --> 30:28.217
I killed Danny Reagan.

30:36.399 --> 30:38.184
We all squared up?

30:42.144 --> 30:44.233
This detective.

30:44.277 --> 30:46.801
He's the son
of the police commissioner.

30:46.845 --> 30:50.239
This will be splashed all over
the news by tomorrow morning.

30:50.283 --> 30:55.636
If it does, then yeah,
we're square.

30:56.898 --> 30:58.334
If it doesn't...

31:04.558 --> 31:06.908
Stop trying to scare me.

31:06.952 --> 31:08.518
I don't feel well.

31:11.913 --> 31:13.175
Get her out of there now.

31:13.219 --> 31:14.307
Go! Go!

31:26.536 --> 31:28.364
Back, back!

31:34.283 --> 31:35.894
Go.

31:39.288 --> 31:40.637
Go! Go!

31:44.424 --> 31:46.295
Stay down!
On the ground!

31:46.339 --> 31:47.557
- Lay down!
- All the way down!

31:47.601 --> 31:48.515
Keep your hands

31:48.558 --> 31:49.168
where we can see
them, right now!

31:53.650 --> 31:55.348
Go.

32:04.400 --> 32:06.272
Hallway's clear!

32:06.315 --> 32:08.274
- Clear!
- Clear!

32:11.277 --> 32:12.974
Danny.

32:30.513 --> 32:33.429
You got to be kidding
me. They're gone.

32:33.473 --> 32:34.996
Yeah, I can see that.

32:43.352 --> 32:45.833
TARU said that three of the guys
you grabbed

32:45.876 --> 32:47.791
all called
the same burner phone.

32:47.835 --> 32:49.402
They're working
on tracking the signal.

32:49.445 --> 32:52.274
We don't find her quick, we're
gonna find her body in bags

32:52.318 --> 32:53.406
at the bottom of the river.

32:53.449 --> 32:54.581
Thanks for reminding
us all of that.

32:54.624 --> 32:55.625
No problem.

32:58.585 --> 33:00.848
Hey, if you didn't pull me
in there when you did...

33:00.891 --> 33:03.851
It was instinct.
Don't make a big deal out of it.

33:03.894 --> 33:05.374
All those years

33:05.418 --> 33:08.464
of Mom telling me
to look after my kid brother.

33:08.508 --> 33:09.726
TARU said

33:09.770 --> 33:11.859
the burner just pinged
off a tower upstate.

33:11.902 --> 33:13.034
The signal's
on the move,

33:13.078 --> 33:14.166
but it's still transmitting.

33:14.209 --> 33:15.341
Let's go.

33:18.213 --> 33:20.999
- MUÑ
- See, one of two
things happened.

33:21.042 --> 33:23.001
You either killed the detective

33:23.044 --> 33:24.698
and the heat followed you, or...

33:26.047 --> 33:28.615
...you snitched and brought him
to my front door.

33:29.616 --> 33:32.532
Just wait, Nieve. You'll see.

33:32.575 --> 33:33.794
Yeah, truth,

33:33.837 --> 33:36.101
like oil, always
rises to the top.

33:37.798 --> 33:40.409
You better hope that
piggy is good and dead.

33:40.453 --> 33:41.497
Because if he isn't...

33:41.541 --> 33:42.846
What are you gonna do?

33:42.890 --> 33:44.283
Get on with it.

33:45.545 --> 33:46.763
I'm not afraid anymore.

33:49.766 --> 33:51.725
Police! Hey!

33:52.769 --> 33:54.380
- Drop it!
- Put it down!

33:54.423 --> 33:55.772
Elena, drop
the knife right now.

33:55.816 --> 33:57.818
Come on.
He's not worth it.

33:57.861 --> 33:58.819
He deserves to die.

33:58.862 --> 33:59.994
And he will die.

34:00.038 --> 34:01.343
He'll die
a nice slow death

34:01.387 --> 34:03.954
as he rots away
in a prison cell. But if

34:03.998 --> 34:05.608
you don't drop that knife,
you're going down with him.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.957
You're right.

34:07.001 --> 34:08.611
But if I cut his throat now,

34:08.655 --> 34:11.310
at least my baby will
never meet its father.

34:11.353 --> 34:12.876
Ever!

34:12.920 --> 34:14.226
He raped you?

34:14.269 --> 34:16.097
Elena.

34:16.141 --> 34:17.577
Don't do this.

34:17.620 --> 34:18.926
You already made
the right decision

34:18.969 --> 34:20.841
when you chose to spare
my brother's life.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.625
- You chose to be a mother.
If that baby

34:22.669 --> 34:24.845
has half as much courage
as you do,

34:24.888 --> 34:26.760
it's not gonna matter
who his piece-of-crap father is.

34:26.803 --> 34:28.109
I promise you.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.111
Do me a favor

34:30.155 --> 34:31.460
and put that knife down.

34:37.684 --> 34:38.989
There you go. Come on.

34:39.033 --> 34:40.078
Come here.

34:40.121 --> 34:42.080
I got him.

34:42.123 --> 34:44.299
On your stomach.

34:49.435 --> 34:50.827
You okay?

34:52.481 --> 34:57.225
If I have a son, I hope he turns
out just like you, Detective.

34:57.269 --> 34:59.140
Well, if you're lucky,

34:59.184 --> 35:01.751
he'll turn out a little bit more
like <i>Sergeant</i> Reagan.

35:06.495 --> 35:08.236
Let's get her looked at.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.499
Come on, get that piece
of crap out of here.

35:13.850 --> 35:15.461
Number four. That's him.

35:15.504 --> 35:16.636
You sure?

35:16.679 --> 35:17.767
Positive. Yeah.

35:17.811 --> 35:19.943
He's the one who assaulted me.

35:19.987 --> 35:23.033
Hold number four,
release the others.

35:23.077 --> 35:25.253
I just need your signature,
and then you can go.

35:25.297 --> 35:26.515
Yeah.

35:28.648 --> 35:30.258
All right.

35:30.302 --> 35:31.607
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

35:31.651 --> 35:33.392
Hey, you work with Erin,
mostly, right?

35:33.435 --> 35:36.960
Yeah, but I've also worked with
that big pain in the ass, too.

35:37.004 --> 35:38.310
Who is that, Danny?

35:38.353 --> 35:40.138
Exactly. But frankly,
they're all...

35:40.181 --> 35:41.313
Opinionated,

35:41.356 --> 35:43.924
holier than thou,
morally superior?

35:43.967 --> 35:45.708
A cut above us mere mortals.

35:45.752 --> 35:47.145
I think I know what you mean.

35:47.188 --> 35:48.668
You know, I used to think
it wasn't for real.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.148
I mean, who has dinner
with the whole family

35:50.191 --> 35:51.584
every Sunday anymore?

35:51.627 --> 35:54.587
- True.
- And the whole
family's in service?

35:54.630 --> 35:56.154
Nobody wanted to make a buck?

35:56.197 --> 35:57.198
I guess not.

35:57.242 --> 35:59.679
I was waiting to find out,
you know,

35:59.722 --> 36:02.899
if they're really corrupt
or greedy or...

36:02.943 --> 36:04.858
secretly hated each other.

36:04.901 --> 36:07.600
Then I realized,
this wasn't a show at all.

36:07.643 --> 36:09.210
I mean, these guys
are the real deal.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.082
And I wish I had what they had.

36:12.126 --> 36:15.042
Yeah, they bust
each other's chops, and mine,

36:15.085 --> 36:16.739
but they'd do anything
for each other,

36:16.783 --> 36:19.264
and anything
for the greater good.

36:19.307 --> 36:21.091
My book?

36:21.135 --> 36:23.355
You're a lucky man
counting them as your family.

36:33.408 --> 36:35.541
I signed out.

36:35.584 --> 36:37.978
You find who owned those cuffs?

36:38.021 --> 36:39.458
No.

36:39.501 --> 36:41.590
Good.

36:41.634 --> 36:43.549
At least one cop
can rest easy tonight

36:43.592 --> 36:44.811
knowing you won't out them.

36:44.854 --> 36:47.422
Just for the record,
I was trying to help,

36:47.466 --> 36:48.902
not get anybody in trouble.

36:48.945 --> 36:50.773
- If you say so.
- Look,

36:50.817 --> 36:53.036
if you want to switch partners,
just put in for it.

36:53.080 --> 36:54.473
No harm no foul.

36:54.516 --> 36:55.430
Well, you sleep with the guy
who makes the roster.

36:56.562 --> 36:58.738
Why don't you take
the lead on that?

37:03.133 --> 37:06.398
Did he get you to ask
for a new partner yet?

37:06.441 --> 37:07.790
What does that mean?

37:07.834 --> 37:09.183
He says he doesn't want
to ride with someone

37:09.227 --> 37:10.576
in the Reagan family.

37:12.839 --> 37:15.015
He was gonna make it
so you request a change.

37:16.669 --> 37:19.672
Oh. So this is, like, planned?

37:19.715 --> 37:21.239
It's kind of his M.O.

37:23.153 --> 37:26.461
His partners go through
a revolving door.

37:26.505 --> 37:28.550
Huh.

37:35.818 --> 37:38.038
Last time unless I'm invited.

37:42.956 --> 37:44.653
May I?

37:52.531 --> 37:54.881
I followed your orders, so...

37:54.924 --> 37:58.363
Well, I just wanted to thank you
for ID'ing the guy.

38:00.843 --> 38:04.369
I heard he was arrested
on federal charges?

38:04.412 --> 38:06.719
Oh, I wouldn't know
anything about that.

38:06.762 --> 38:09.374
The Feds never tell us
what they're doing.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.028
Hmm.

38:24.040 --> 38:27.261
Your dad's graduation
from the academy.

38:28.697 --> 38:29.916
Thank you.

38:33.267 --> 38:35.269
He'd be proud of you.

38:39.926 --> 38:43.408
Well, your grandpa's
got work to do.

38:44.626 --> 38:45.932
My schedule cleared up,

38:45.975 --> 38:47.760
so if your invitation
to family dinner

38:47.803 --> 38:49.152
still holds...

38:49.196 --> 38:50.806
It does.

38:50.850 --> 38:53.374
I'd like to come.

38:55.507 --> 38:57.335
Bring the dessert.

39:02.557 --> 39:04.342
In the case of the people
of the state of New York

39:04.385 --> 39:05.865
against the defendant
Sandra Harris,

39:05.908 --> 39:07.693
has the jury
reached a verdict?

39:07.736 --> 39:09.085
We have, Your Honor.

39:09.129 --> 39:10.609
Will the defendant please rise?

39:12.872 --> 39:14.569
How does the jury find?

39:14.613 --> 39:16.528
On the charge of murder
in the second degree,

39:16.571 --> 39:20.401
we find the defendant
Sandra Harris, not guilty.

39:20.445 --> 39:21.533
Sandra Harris,

39:21.576 --> 39:22.621
you have been
found not guilty

39:22.664 --> 39:24.187
in the murder
of Reggie Lewis.

39:24.231 --> 39:26.799
You are free to go.

39:26.842 --> 39:28.540
Thank you, Your Honor.

39:41.466 --> 39:43.424
I'm sorry you lost the case.

39:43.468 --> 39:44.730
Are you?

39:44.773 --> 39:46.819
- What does that mean?
- As a prosecutor,

39:46.862 --> 39:49.212
you know that
when an eyewitness lies,

39:49.256 --> 39:51.650
it's impossible to prove
the defendant guilty

39:51.693 --> 39:53.652
beyond reasonable doubt.

39:53.695 --> 39:56.568
Are you seriously suggesting
I helped Leticia win the case?

39:56.611 --> 39:58.004
You tell me.

39:58.047 --> 40:00.615
Maybe you weren't
as interested in winning

40:00.659 --> 40:03.792
as you were making sure my name
got dragged through the mud.

40:03.836 --> 40:05.881
Right, because this has been
such a walk in the park for me?

40:05.925 --> 40:09.581
I'd say it's brought you a
little closer to the D.A. seat.

40:11.800 --> 40:16.979
If I decide to run for the D.A.,
you will be the first to know.

40:17.023 --> 40:19.547
And be assured that when
I prosecute a case,

40:19.591 --> 40:22.898
it's to win
so justice can be served.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.944
Then, I guess
Leticia won the case

40:24.987 --> 40:26.859
because she simply
out-lawyered you.

40:38.305 --> 40:40.263
Yeah, I'm still
not really sure about this.

40:40.307 --> 40:41.830
Trust me, it's gonna be
all right. It's gonna be--

40:41.874 --> 40:43.615
All right, everybody. Showtime.

40:45.051 --> 40:46.792
What is this again?

40:46.835 --> 40:48.837
I found some lost
home video footage, Pop.

40:48.881 --> 40:50.665
- Ooh, I hope
it's Montauk.

40:50.709 --> 40:52.450
I miss that place every day.

40:52.493 --> 40:53.973
Come on, you guys, let's go.

40:54.016 --> 40:55.365
Yeah, come on.

40:55.409 --> 40:56.541
What are we watching here?

40:56.584 --> 40:58.238
- Yeah.
- I'm hoping Montauk,

40:58.281 --> 40:59.587
back in the day.

40:59.631 --> 41:00.632
No, it's a new one.

41:00.675 --> 41:01.720
We haven't
made any home videos

41:01.763 --> 41:03.461
of the kids
since they were little.

41:03.504 --> 41:05.158
And here we go.

41:08.422 --> 41:09.989
Hey, give me the cash, man.

41:10.032 --> 41:11.251
Whoa.

41:11.294 --> 41:13.166
What's this?

41:13.209 --> 41:15.081
What is this, footage
of the Good Samaritan?

41:15.124 --> 41:15.995
Give me the cash.
- Just watch.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.518
Here comes our hero.

41:17.562 --> 41:18.432
I'm gonna hit the button
right here, all right?

41:18.476 --> 41:19.955
It's open, all right?

41:19.999 --> 41:21.043
- I'm gonna get a bag.
- Grandpa,

41:21.087 --> 41:22.523
you're the Good Samaritan?

41:22.567 --> 41:23.524
You told?

41:23.568 --> 41:24.830
No, I didn't. I swear.

41:24.873 --> 41:27.093
It wasn't her, Pop.
This was all me.

41:27.136 --> 41:29.487
Be smart or be dead.

41:29.530 --> 41:30.792
Wow. Gramps.

41:30.836 --> 41:32.533
Put the gun on the counter.

41:32.577 --> 41:34.927
You know, hold on, Jamie.

41:34.970 --> 41:36.232
Wow.

41:36.276 --> 41:37.973
You know,
anybody asked me,

41:38.017 --> 41:40.498
I could've told them.

41:40.541 --> 41:42.761
"Be smart or be dead."

41:42.804 --> 41:44.414
That's my Pop.

41:44.458 --> 41:46.373
- It really does
run in our DNA

41:46.416 --> 41:47.417
because of you, Gramps.

41:47.461 --> 41:48.636
I mean, look at you there.

41:48.680 --> 41:50.464
You're like
the-the Gray Panther.

41:53.162 --> 41:54.555
Eh, just an ex-cop.

41:54.599 --> 41:56.557
- More than just
an ex-cop.

41:56.601 --> 41:58.211
A hero ex-cop.

41:58.254 --> 41:59.342
Yeah.

41:59.386 --> 42:01.170
I'm glad I did it.

42:01.214 --> 42:03.738
And I'd do it again,
so don't start lecturing me.

42:03.782 --> 42:06.349
- I'm not gonna lecture you.
- You're still the man, Gramps.

42:06.393 --> 42:08.177
Seriously, I want to be you
when I grow up.

42:08.221 --> 42:10.049
- And I'm stealing
that line.

42:10.092 --> 42:11.920
"Be smart or be dead."

42:14.706 --> 42:16.316
- I did it without
thinking.

42:16.359 --> 42:20.189
I felt like a cop again there
for a few minutes.

42:20.233 --> 42:21.930
God, it felt good.

42:23.889 --> 42:26.065
I felt relevant.

42:30.330 --> 42:33.551
Well, more like irreplaceable.
