WEBVTT

00:07.307 --> 00:10.611
Hi, I'm looking for... her.

00:10.644 --> 00:11.745
Lindsay.

00:11.778 --> 00:13.580
Jeannie? Hey.

00:13.614 --> 00:14.581
Hi.

00:14.615 --> 00:16.349
(chuckles)
How are you?

00:16.382 --> 00:18.685
I'm fine. I see I don't
have to ask what's new.

00:18.719 --> 00:20.153
Yeah, about five months.

00:20.186 --> 00:21.487
I knew her
when she was a virgin.

00:21.522 --> 00:23.123
LINDSAY: Funny.

00:23.156 --> 00:24.791
Listen, you got two seconds?
I'm on a major clock.

00:24.825 --> 00:26.392
Sure.

00:26.426 --> 00:29.395
You must be a witch.
I have been meaning to call you.

00:29.429 --> 00:30.797
Yeah, yeah.

00:30.831 --> 00:33.233
Thanks for inviting me
to the wedding, by the way.

00:33.266 --> 00:35.235
-Eloped.
-Right.

00:35.268 --> 00:37.638
Listen-- William Hinks.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.407
I've been treating him.

00:41.441 --> 00:43.143
The William Hinks?

00:43.176 --> 00:44.511
Yes.

00:44.545 --> 00:46.513
Did he start
killing people

00:46.547 --> 00:48.515
after you began
treating him, or...

00:48.549 --> 00:49.816
That's cute.

00:49.850 --> 00:54.154
(sighs)
I don't think he did it.

00:54.187 --> 00:56.356
What do you mean,
you don't think he did it?
He confessed.

00:56.389 --> 00:58.525
I think he fabricated
that confession.

00:58.559 --> 01:00.393
He made up
that he killed nine people?

01:00.426 --> 01:01.394
Yes.

01:01.427 --> 01:02.529
And fooled the police?

01:02.563 --> 01:03.730
It's complicated.

01:03.764 --> 01:05.666
Listen,
as you probably know,

01:05.699 --> 01:07.634
the trial starts
in two days.

01:07.668 --> 01:09.670
He just fired
his attorney.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.371
The judge, I'm told,

01:11.404 --> 01:13.206
is not likely to grant him
much of a continuance.

01:13.239 --> 01:17.310
He'll probably assign
a public defender, and...

01:17.343 --> 01:20.313
Lindsay, would you
consider doing it?

01:20.346 --> 01:22.649
Defending William Hinks?

01:22.683 --> 01:25.652
You've become this big star.
I read about you now.

01:25.686 --> 01:29.155
I don't do
serial killers, Jeannie.

01:29.189 --> 01:32.526
Lindsay, I believe
the man didn't do it.

01:32.559 --> 01:34.427
Yes, he says he did,

01:34.460 --> 01:36.429
but as good as you are
at what you do,

01:36.462 --> 01:38.431
I am just as good
at what I do,

01:38.464 --> 01:40.701
and I'm telling you,
I have become

01:40.734 --> 01:43.169
more and more convinced
he's delusional.

01:43.203 --> 01:45.438
William Hinks is not
the serial killer

01:45.471 --> 01:46.840
who murdered those women,

01:46.873 --> 01:49.810
and right now
he needs a good lawyer.

01:52.579 --> 01:55.582
â™ª (theme)

02:45.231 --> 02:46.767
BOBBY: I don't think
you should take it.

02:46.800 --> 02:49.369
My first instinct was not to,
but she says he's innocent.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.737
I don't know,
Lindsay.

02:50.771 --> 02:52.272
How do you start
such a monster of a trial

02:52.305 --> 02:53.574
on two days' notice?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.375
The defense
is fully developed.

02:55.408 --> 02:56.910
John Moore was the lawyer.
He's good.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.579
Stephen Banks
was the lawyer before that,

02:58.612 --> 03:00.781
and he's excellent.

03:00.814 --> 03:02.683
What happened to them?

03:02.716 --> 03:04.350
Well, he fired them.

03:04.384 --> 03:06.252
According to Jeannie,
when they confronted Hinks

03:06.286 --> 03:07.821
about his possibly
being delusional,

03:07.854 --> 03:09.690
he fired them.

03:09.723 --> 03:12.258
The man can't face the idea
that maybe he's not the killer.

03:12.292 --> 03:13.794
In which case
how do you defend him?

03:13.827 --> 03:15.729
And why would you
even want to?

03:15.762 --> 03:17.698
I'd be going up against
Roland Hill, for one thing.

03:17.731 --> 03:19.465
How often does any lawyer
get the chance

03:19.499 --> 03:20.767
to go up against him?

03:20.801 --> 03:23.269
Not very often,
but if I were going to do it,

03:23.303 --> 03:24.905
I certainly wouldn't
want a client

03:24.938 --> 03:26.472
who insists he's guilty.

03:26.507 --> 03:28.274
You people supposedly
defend underdogs.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.643
I've got one here.

03:29.676 --> 03:31.912
He's ill,
and unless we help him,

03:31.945 --> 03:33.880
he's going to destroy
his life.

03:33.914 --> 03:37.718
I want to do it, Bobby,
but I will need backup.

03:37.751 --> 03:39.352
I can do it.

03:39.385 --> 03:40.987
-I was first. I got dibs.
-You were not first.

03:41.021 --> 03:42.623
BOBBY: All right.

03:42.656 --> 03:46.259
-Lindsay, you sure?
-Yes.

03:46.292 --> 03:49.262
(sighs)
Jimmy, you second chair.

03:49.295 --> 03:50.396
That's not fair.

03:50.430 --> 03:52.933
Thank you. Thanks.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.539
He's really
a docile man.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.807
Just misunderstood.

04:00.841 --> 04:03.644
Do we need
a guard in the room?

04:03.677 --> 04:07.614
It's your call.
You'll lose privilege.

04:09.683 --> 04:12.919
I think
we can take him.

04:12.953 --> 04:14.855
Okay.

04:23.764 --> 04:25.732
William,
this is Lindsay Dole,

04:25.766 --> 04:27.668
the lawyer I was
telling you about,

04:27.701 --> 04:30.003
and this is Jimmy Berluti,
also with the same firm.

04:30.036 --> 04:32.573
My pleasure.

04:32.606 --> 04:35.509
I guess "thank you"
is in order.

04:35.542 --> 04:39.045
Mr. Hinks, we continued
the trial until next week,

04:39.079 --> 04:41.047
which means
you may get transferred

04:41.081 --> 04:42.749
back to Cedar Junction.

04:42.783 --> 04:44.785
They don't like keeping
maximum security prisoners

04:44.818 --> 04:46.352
in lockup for too long.

04:46.386 --> 04:47.954
What we're going
to do first

04:47.988 --> 04:50.356
is go over the confessions
and the evidence,

04:50.390 --> 04:52.492
and then we'll get
back together and talk.

04:52.526 --> 04:54.628
What is there
to talk about?

04:56.062 --> 04:58.031
Well, Dr. Reynolds
tells me

04:58.064 --> 05:01.367
it's your preference
to plead insanity.

05:01.401 --> 05:04.437
You realize if we win
on that, you don't go free.

05:04.470 --> 05:06.339
Yes, I realize that.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.775
If we could possibly get
a straight not guilty--

05:08.809 --> 05:10.511
No.

05:10.544 --> 05:14.347
I did it, Ms. Dole.

05:14.380 --> 05:16.783
At least with insanity,
I can perhaps be sent

05:16.817 --> 05:19.352
to a place where they'll
help me get better.

05:19.385 --> 05:20.787
Even if that's true,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.757
you won't be getting out.

05:26.126 --> 05:28.094
The closest diagnosis
I can make

05:28.128 --> 05:30.096
is that he has delusions,

05:30.130 --> 05:32.398
symptomatic of schizophrenia,
probably paranoid.

05:32.432 --> 05:34.568
Not only does he believe
he committed these crimes,

05:34.601 --> 05:36.837
the idea of others
not believing it

05:36.870 --> 05:38.972
is, for some reason,
repugnant to him.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.841
But if he didn't do them,

05:40.874 --> 05:43.109
he sure gave them
a lot of details.

05:43.143 --> 05:45.579
Almost all the information
he provided in his confession

05:45.612 --> 05:47.047
was accessible.

05:47.080 --> 05:49.049
There's a whole internet site
set up on this killer.

05:49.082 --> 05:50.817
A lot of these facts
are available

05:50.851 --> 05:52.519
to the general public.

05:52.553 --> 05:54.454
Jeannie, tell me why
you think he didn't do it.

05:54.487 --> 05:56.690
For one thing, he's got
a lot of holes in his story.

05:56.723 --> 05:58.992
I also don't get
any sense of anger in him.

05:59.025 --> 06:01.528
I don't see the necessary
capacity for violence.

06:01.562 --> 06:03.063
He's a quiet
little accountant

06:03.096 --> 06:04.731
who never
leaves his house.

06:04.765 --> 06:06.633
It's always
the quiet ones.

06:06.667 --> 06:08.535
I also put him
under hypnosis.

06:08.569 --> 06:10.837
There, he told
a very different story.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.072
Which was?

06:12.105 --> 06:14.074
Basically,
that he didn't do it--

06:14.107 --> 06:15.976
that he wishes he did it.

06:16.009 --> 06:17.544
They found him

06:17.578 --> 06:19.980
near the scene
of his last victim.

06:20.013 --> 06:21.982
He said
he has a police radio.

06:22.015 --> 06:23.850
According to his story
under hypnosis,

06:23.884 --> 06:26.452
he heard of the crime,
he managed to go there,

06:26.486 --> 06:27.954
get into
a neighboring cellar,

06:27.988 --> 06:29.455
and let himself
be discovered there.

06:29.489 --> 06:31.124
The police are pretty good

06:31.157 --> 06:32.993
about sniffing out
false confessions.

06:33.026 --> 06:35.696
He is extremely smart--
borderline genius.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.698
He also
passed the polygraph,

06:37.731 --> 06:40.166
which he would
if he were delusional.

06:40.200 --> 06:43.469
Any chance he could have been
faking with the hypnosis?

06:43.504 --> 06:45.005
That's what I thought
at first,

06:45.038 --> 06:46.873
but I don't
believe it now.

06:46.907 --> 06:48.975
Either way, Jeannie,
if he convinced the police

06:49.009 --> 06:51.512
with his confession,
including an FBI profiler,

06:51.545 --> 06:52.879
he'll likely
fool a jury.

06:52.913 --> 06:56.016
He didn't necessarily
fool the FBI profiler.

06:57.518 --> 06:59.986
What?

07:00.020 --> 07:01.487
I was suspicious.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.724
There were certain facts
he should have had

07:03.757 --> 07:05.892
if he were the real killer,
and he didn't.

07:05.926 --> 07:07.460
Such as?

07:07.493 --> 07:09.730
Times of death.
He could only approximate.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.464
A killer that precise,

07:11.497 --> 07:13.567
I'd have thought
he'd be clear on time.

07:13.600 --> 07:15.802
Positions of the bodies,
also the fingernails.

07:15.836 --> 07:17.470
What about
the fingernails?

07:17.504 --> 07:19.573
Well, you saw that he pulled
them off all of his victims.

07:19.606 --> 07:21.074
And?

07:21.107 --> 07:22.609
He actually didn't.

07:22.643 --> 07:24.244
The police
planted that disinformation

07:24.277 --> 07:25.712
for the very reason

07:25.746 --> 07:27.548
to trip up
any false confessions.

07:27.581 --> 07:29.015
Hinks has maintained

07:29.049 --> 07:31.552
that he pulled the nails out
of all of his victims,

07:31.585 --> 07:33.253
just as reported
in the papers.

07:33.286 --> 07:35.021
If you've
checked discovery,

07:35.055 --> 07:37.724
you now know that the nails
of the fifth victim

07:37.758 --> 07:39.092
were never removed.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.494
That's something
the real killer should know.

07:41.528 --> 07:45.098
But you signed off
on this being the guy.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.001
Because he did have a lot
of very specific details.

07:48.034 --> 07:50.837
He was found near the scene
of the last one,

07:50.871 --> 07:52.739
and when they searched
his apartment,

07:52.773 --> 07:54.174
they found
voluminous clippings,

07:54.207 --> 07:55.842
internet printouts,
whatever,

07:55.876 --> 07:57.844
on each and every
previous killing.

07:57.878 --> 07:59.846
But he could have
collected that stuff

07:59.880 --> 08:01.181
to learn
about the murders.

08:01.214 --> 08:03.183
Or he was the murderer

08:03.216 --> 08:05.185
and he liked to read
about himself,

08:05.218 --> 08:07.754
which is pretty typical
of serial killers.

08:07.788 --> 08:09.790
One more thing--

08:09.823 --> 08:11.191
the killings stopped

08:11.224 --> 08:13.894
as soon as William Hinks
was in custody.

08:15.629 --> 08:17.531
So you think he's it?

08:17.564 --> 08:19.800
I think
he's probably the one.

08:19.833 --> 08:21.868
But maybe not.

08:21.902 --> 08:24.805
Maybe not.

08:29.109 --> 08:30.711
How do we defend him?

08:30.744 --> 08:32.813
If we plead not guilty,
he'll fire us.

08:32.846 --> 08:35.048
Which, more than anything else,
is telling me he didn't do it.

08:35.081 --> 08:36.683
How do you figure?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.318
Well, a guilty man would
want to get an acquittal

08:38.351 --> 08:40.253
if he could,
don't you think?

08:40.285 --> 08:42.022
A man obsessed with having
the world think he's guilty,

08:42.054 --> 08:43.557
on the other hand...

08:43.590 --> 08:45.959
Isn't it possible
it could be both,

08:45.992 --> 08:47.994
guilty and wanting
everyone to know it?

08:48.028 --> 08:50.531
Possible, but I just don't
see it that way.

08:51.998 --> 08:54.234
Maybe we just stick
with insanity.

08:54.267 --> 08:56.803
Who knows? Maybe we could
win that way.

08:56.837 --> 08:58.905
But we don't believe
he did it, Jimmy.

08:58.939 --> 09:00.674
We can't argue he was insane
at the time he did it

09:00.707 --> 09:02.609
if we know
he didn't do it.

09:02.643 --> 09:06.046
We don't know it, Lindsay.
We don't know anything.

09:06.079 --> 09:08.782
Could you ever go to a judge
and get an order

09:08.815 --> 09:10.984
that he has to plead
not guilty?

09:11.017 --> 09:13.620
I've never heard
of that happening.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.623
Everybody wants it
to be him, Lindsay,

09:16.657 --> 09:18.625
because they're afraid,

09:18.659 --> 09:22.896
and he wants it to be him,
but it's not him.

09:37.043 --> 09:38.612
I don't understand.

09:38.645 --> 09:40.280
Are you arguing insanity
or not?

09:40.313 --> 09:42.282
Mr. Hinks, this is
extremely complicated.

09:42.315 --> 09:44.751
You're just going
to have to trust me.

09:44.785 --> 09:45.986
Can you do that?

09:46.019 --> 09:47.721
No, I can't, Ms. Dole.

09:47.754 --> 09:49.355
My future is at stake--
my life.

09:49.389 --> 09:51.191
I've known you
less than a week.

09:51.224 --> 09:52.659
William, you trust me,
don't you?

09:52.693 --> 09:54.360
Please don't handle me.

09:54.394 --> 09:56.630
I'm not some anonymous
little man to be handled.

09:56.663 --> 09:58.765
The plan is to keep you
out of prison,

09:58.799 --> 10:00.667
but it may involve you
having to hear

10:00.701 --> 10:02.168
some things in court
you don't want to hear.

10:02.202 --> 10:04.905
It could also mean
you having to testify,

10:04.938 --> 10:06.840
so be prepared for that.

10:06.873 --> 10:09.242
Testify?

10:12.212 --> 10:15.215
Your only chance at this point
is to trust her, William.

10:24.090 --> 10:27.694
Are we going with insanity
or not, Ms. Dole?

10:27.728 --> 10:30.330
Yes.

10:30.363 --> 10:33.399
We're going with insanity.

10:36.903 --> 10:39.139
All right.

10:39.172 --> 10:41.307
Insanity.

10:51.451 --> 10:54.420
WILLIAM: I always chose to drop the weapon
at the scene,

10:54.454 --> 10:56.422
relieving myself
of the worry

10:56.456 --> 10:58.992
of it ever being found
in my possession.

10:59.025 --> 11:01.427
The gloves
I would either burn

11:01.461 --> 11:03.897
or dispose of
at the right opportunity.

11:03.930 --> 11:05.165
MAN: Why the fingernails?

11:05.198 --> 11:08.068
WILLIAM:
Souvenir, I suppose.

11:08.101 --> 11:10.070
A fingernail
is easier to remove

11:10.103 --> 11:12.338
than one might expect.

11:12.372 --> 11:16.342
Less bloody as well.

11:16.376 --> 11:18.912
How many times
we got to watch it?

11:18.945 --> 11:20.914
Until we've memorized
every word.

11:20.947 --> 11:23.416
This confession
is their whole case.

11:23.449 --> 11:26.052
I would have probably
removed all 10

11:26.086 --> 11:28.321
except for
the time consumption.

11:28.354 --> 11:30.891
It takes patience
to extract the fingernail

11:30.924 --> 11:33.326
without damaging it.

11:33.359 --> 11:36.329
I liked them in mint
condition, of course,

11:36.362 --> 11:39.900
and it's difficult
not to rush

11:39.933 --> 11:43.469
when you have a dissected
carcass in the room.

11:43.504 --> 11:46.106
It can make you jumpy.

11:51.411 --> 11:53.947
We will introduce
more of this tape

11:53.980 --> 11:56.449
during the trial,

11:56.482 --> 11:59.119
but the footage
that you just saw

11:59.152 --> 12:01.121
will be introduced
as evidence

12:01.154 --> 12:05.125
of the defendant's clarity
during his confession--

12:05.158 --> 12:10.864
his precision,
his careful choice of words.

12:10.897 --> 12:14.134
He had just committed
a murder and dismemberment

12:14.167 --> 12:17.403
three hours
before this interview.

12:17.437 --> 12:21.975
This was a man in control,

12:22.008 --> 12:25.145
a man who understood
the nature and the quality

12:25.178 --> 12:28.782
of the horrific acts
he had committed.

12:28.815 --> 12:30.851
The evidence will show

12:30.884 --> 12:32.886
that these crimes
were carried out

12:32.919 --> 12:37.423
with detailed precision,
with thorough premeditation.

12:37.457 --> 12:41.427
The evidence will reveal
cold-blooded murder--

12:41.461 --> 12:43.997
executions, if you will--

12:44.620 --> 12:50.070
committed by a man who knew
exactly what he was doing.

13:07.320 --> 13:11.191
William Hinks is insane.

13:24.337 --> 13:26.306
All nine victims had dogs.

13:26.339 --> 13:29.576
Mr. Hinks met all of them
in various parks and streets

13:29.610 --> 13:31.177
while walking his dog.

13:31.211 --> 13:33.446
And you learned this
how, detective?

13:33.479 --> 13:35.315
From his confession.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.317
Then he would
telephone them,

13:37.350 --> 13:39.920
always from a public
phone booth,

13:39.953 --> 13:42.322
make a date or
a plan to see them,

13:42.355 --> 13:45.491
be let into their homes,
and he'd kill them.

13:45.526 --> 13:48.061
From your experience,
did these killings appear

13:48.094 --> 13:50.330
to be acts
of uncontrolled behavior?

13:50.363 --> 13:51.632
No.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.099
Why is that, sir?

13:53.133 --> 13:54.901
First of all,
they were meticulous.

13:54.935 --> 13:56.269
Other than the mutilations,

13:56.302 --> 13:58.171
which, of course,
were bloody,

13:58.204 --> 14:00.073
there was never
any evidence.

14:00.106 --> 14:02.509
No fingerprints, no DNA.

14:02.543 --> 14:04.244
The weapon was always
carefully placed

14:04.277 --> 14:05.546
next to the torso.

14:05.579 --> 14:08.081
The first wound
was always fatal.

14:08.114 --> 14:09.516
How could you tell that?

14:09.550 --> 14:12.085
There was never
a sign of a struggle.

14:12.118 --> 14:15.556
Plus, the coroner's report
would always confirm this.

14:15.589 --> 14:17.558
Is it
your testimony, sir,

14:17.591 --> 14:20.026
that a killer acting
outside of conscious control

14:20.060 --> 14:22.295
could never act
in a meticulous manner?

14:22.328 --> 14:23.564
It's not the norm.

14:23.597 --> 14:25.031
Is it possible?

14:25.065 --> 14:27.000
It's possible, but--

14:27.033 --> 14:29.035
Thank you. You've answered
the question.

14:29.069 --> 14:31.538
Actually, I didn't, counsel.
I'd like to complete it.

14:31.572 --> 14:33.473
It was
a yes or no question.

14:33.507 --> 14:36.309
But it was evidently not
a yes or no answer, your honor.

14:36.342 --> 14:39.045
The witness may complete
his response.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.481
If the last victim
hadn't hit that silent alarm,

14:41.515 --> 14:43.383
if we hadn't
found the defendant

14:43.416 --> 14:46.186
in that basement,
he'd still be out there.

14:46.219 --> 14:48.622
We called these murders
the immaculate dissections

14:48.655 --> 14:51.191
because the scenes
were free of evidence.

14:51.224 --> 14:52.626
I mean clean.

14:52.659 --> 14:54.928
That takes planning--
skill.

14:54.961 --> 14:57.330
He didn't just know
what he was doing,

14:57.363 --> 14:59.933
he knew how to do it
perfectly.

14:59.966 --> 15:01.401
Are you finished now?

15:01.434 --> 15:02.703
Yes.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.071
Thank you, detective.
Nothing further.

15:11.211 --> 15:12.579
JUDGE: Mr. Hill?

15:12.613 --> 15:14.414
Prosecution rests,
your honor,

15:14.447 --> 15:17.083
saving our psychiatric
evidence for rebuttal.

15:17.117 --> 15:19.285
The witness may step down.

15:21.187 --> 15:24.224
The defense calls
Dr. Jean Reynolds.

15:25.659 --> 15:27.193
All set?

15:27.227 --> 15:28.194
I think.

15:28.228 --> 15:29.630
Watch yourself.

15:29.663 --> 15:31.698
Don't worry.

15:33.667 --> 15:36.537
Could you state your name and
occupation for the record?

15:36.570 --> 15:39.372
Jean Reynolds.
I'm a criminal psychologist.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.007
Could you briefly describe

15:41.041 --> 15:42.743
what you mean
by criminal psychologist?

15:42.776 --> 15:44.745
It's basically
how it sounds.

15:44.778 --> 15:46.379
I've spent 10 years

15:46.412 --> 15:48.214
treating patients
charged with violent crimes,

15:48.248 --> 15:50.216
as well as studying
behavioral patterns

15:50.250 --> 15:51.652
of repeat offenders,

15:51.685 --> 15:53.654
including the patterns
of serial killers.

15:53.687 --> 15:55.656
Dr. Reynolds,
did you have opportunity

15:55.689 --> 15:57.724
to treat my client
Mr. William Hinks?

15:57.758 --> 16:00.493
-I did.
-Did you have opportunity
to discuss with my client

16:00.527 --> 16:02.128
the crimes
which he is currently

16:02.162 --> 16:03.664
being charged with
in this trial?

16:03.697 --> 16:06.499
-I did.
-Did you form any
medical conclusion

16:06.533 --> 16:07.534
as a result
of this treatment?

16:07.568 --> 16:09.335
Yes.

16:09.369 --> 16:11.371
Could you please
state that opinion
for the court?

16:11.404 --> 16:14.107
I do not believe Mr. Hinks
killed those women.

16:14.140 --> 16:17.177
(gallery murmuring)

16:18.712 --> 16:22.082
He did not
commit the crimes?

16:22.115 --> 16:24.751
My opinion is Mr. Hinks is
suffering from delusions

16:24.785 --> 16:27.020
secondary to schizophrenia.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.089
Basically, he thinks
he killed those women.

16:29.122 --> 16:31.024
He did not.

16:31.057 --> 16:33.193
And on what do you base
this opinion?

16:33.226 --> 16:36.062
On 30 hours of treatment
with Mr. Hinks,

16:36.096 --> 16:39.633
as well as 10 years of
practical and academic
experience.

16:39.666 --> 16:42.636
I also placed Mr. Hinks
under hypnosis

16:42.669 --> 16:45.772
where he told me
he did not kill those women.

16:45.806 --> 16:47.373
Objection. Hearsay.

16:47.407 --> 16:49.510
Under hypnosis,
the reliability of--

16:49.543 --> 16:52.513
There is no hypnosis exception
to the hearsay rule.

16:52.546 --> 16:54.380
Your honor,
I would like a sidebar.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.182
Mr. Hinks,
please sit down.

16:56.216 --> 16:58.118
I seek
to discharge counsel.

16:58.151 --> 16:59.620
She is soliciting false
testimony from this witness.

16:59.653 --> 17:01.354
Mr. Hinks,
I asked you to sit down.

17:01.387 --> 17:03.356
She doesn't represent
my interest,

17:03.389 --> 17:05.726
nor does she represent
the truth.

17:05.759 --> 17:08.662
I ask that
she be removed.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.696
Mr. Hinks,
take your seat now.

17:16.770 --> 17:19.740
I am very confused here.

17:19.772 --> 17:22.375
You entered a plea
of not guilty

17:22.407 --> 17:23.844
by reason of insanity.

17:23.877 --> 17:25.444
Defense seeks
to change that plea

17:25.478 --> 17:27.079
to a straight not guilty.

17:27.113 --> 17:30.116
Mr. Hinks never killed
those women at all.

17:30.150 --> 17:32.085
This is a lie,
your honor!

17:32.118 --> 17:34.454
Security, take Mr. Hinks
into custody.

17:34.487 --> 17:37.658
I will see counsel
in chambers now.

17:45.431 --> 17:47.400
What the hell's
going on?

17:47.433 --> 17:49.503
He didn't commit
the crimes.

17:49.536 --> 17:50.837
Wait a second.

17:50.871 --> 17:52.405
It was your intent
all along to argue this?

17:52.438 --> 17:53.674
Yes.

17:53.707 --> 17:56.376
You committed a fraud
on the court, counsel.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.579
You filed an affirmative
defense of insanity.

17:58.612 --> 18:01.381
-We had to.
-You had to?

18:01.414 --> 18:02.482
Yes.

18:02.516 --> 18:05.185
We had to keep it
from our client.

18:05.218 --> 18:07.788
That necessitated
keeping it from the court.

18:07.821 --> 18:10.456
You kept your strategy
from your client?

18:10.490 --> 18:12.726
Your honor, he's delusional.
He not only thinks he did it,

18:12.759 --> 18:16.162
he wants others to think
he did it, which precluded--

18:16.196 --> 18:18.331
Then you should have
had him declared
incompetent to stand trial.

18:18.364 --> 18:20.333
He would have passed
the competency test easily

18:20.366 --> 18:21.868
and we'd be
right back in court.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.770
You do not commit
a fraud on the court

18:23.804 --> 18:25.506
or the district attorney.

18:25.539 --> 18:26.807
These circumstances
warranted us--

18:26.840 --> 18:28.174
No, they did not,
counsel.

18:28.208 --> 18:29.510
Yes, they did,
your honor.

18:29.543 --> 18:31.678
With all due respect,
William Hinks was prepared

18:31.712 --> 18:35.248
to let himself be convicted
for a crime he didn't commit.

18:35.281 --> 18:36.817
That's a bigger fraud--

18:36.850 --> 18:39.886
a fraud that leaves the real
killer still out there.

18:39.920 --> 18:42.188
And how do we know
that this isn't a trick?

18:42.222 --> 18:44.625
If the defendant has not
agreed to the change of plea,

18:44.658 --> 18:46.627
he has an automatic grounds
for a new trial.

18:46.660 --> 18:48.261
This isn't a trick.

18:48.294 --> 18:50.363
You have my word
as an officer of the court.

18:50.396 --> 18:51.898
That doesn't solve it.

18:51.932 --> 18:54.234
You cannot change the plea
without the client's consent.

18:54.267 --> 18:56.503
The man has fired
two previous attorneys

18:56.537 --> 18:58.404
who wanted to prove
his innocence

18:58.438 --> 19:00.674
because he doesn't want
to be innocent.

19:00.707 --> 19:02.442
We had to keep him
in the dark,

19:02.475 --> 19:04.845
and that meant keeping
the court in the dark.

19:04.878 --> 19:07.313
And if he loses,
his next lawyer

19:07.347 --> 19:09.683
will be in here arguing
your incompetency for--

19:09.716 --> 19:12.418
Look, this is
an unusual thing here.

19:12.452 --> 19:15.689
We got a defendant
whose sickness prevents him

19:15.722 --> 19:17.791
from wanting
to be found innocent.

19:17.824 --> 19:19.960
If we had pled
straight not guilty,

19:19.993 --> 19:21.695
he would have fired us

19:21.728 --> 19:23.964
like he fired
the two guys before us.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.867
He would have went out
and eventually found a lawyer

19:26.900 --> 19:29.870
to tell his lie,
and as I said, in our minds,

19:29.903 --> 19:32.573
that would have been
the biggest fraud.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.411
Who the hell
do you think you are?

19:38.444 --> 19:39.780
I'm your doctor,
William.

19:39.813 --> 19:41.815
No, you're not.
Do you get that?

19:41.848 --> 19:42.949
No, you are not.
You are all discharged.

19:42.983 --> 19:44.484
That can't happen.

19:44.518 --> 19:46.887
The judge has ordered us
to stay on.

19:53.359 --> 19:56.462
William, you're ill.

19:56.496 --> 19:59.800
You think
you committed those crimes.

19:59.833 --> 20:01.234
Under hypnosis,

20:01.267 --> 20:02.736
you admitted to me
you didn't.

20:02.769 --> 20:04.738
Maybe I was lying
under hypnosis.

20:04.771 --> 20:07.007
You think about that?

20:07.040 --> 20:09.009
Maybe I was in denial.

20:09.042 --> 20:11.645
For God's sake,
I killed nine women.

20:11.678 --> 20:13.914
I can't be in denial?

20:13.947 --> 20:16.583
William, all I care about
for this discussion

20:16.617 --> 20:18.919
is keeping you
out of prison.

20:18.952 --> 20:20.921
Why, so I can get
mental treatment

20:20.954 --> 20:23.289
for my disorder?
Is that the secret plan?

20:28.328 --> 20:30.864
-I'm testifying.
-We don't think that's--

20:30.897 --> 20:32.032
I have a right
to testify, Ms. Dole.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.034
If I'm competent
to stand trial,

20:34.067 --> 20:36.036
I'm competent
to make this decision.

20:36.069 --> 20:38.605
I will be getting
into that witness chair.

20:38.639 --> 20:42.042
You cannot prevent that.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.911
I'm testifying.

21:02.629 --> 21:03.964
And while under hypnosis,

21:03.997 --> 21:05.899
what did he say
about the basement?

21:05.932 --> 21:08.535
That he'd heard about
the crime on his police radio,

21:08.569 --> 21:10.904
together with the suspicion
that it was this same killer,

21:10.937 --> 21:12.472
and went to the scene.

21:12.506 --> 21:14.440
Police were all over it,

21:14.474 --> 21:17.343
so he broke into the basement
two houses away.

21:17.377 --> 21:18.912
I renew
my hearsay objection.

21:18.945 --> 21:21.014
This is all being asserted
as the truth.

21:21.047 --> 21:23.917
Mr. Hill, your objection
is noted and overruled.

21:23.950 --> 21:27.353
Did he say why he went
into that basement?

21:27.387 --> 21:29.623
No. I can only guess,
on some level,

21:29.656 --> 21:31.391
he wanted to be caught.

21:31.424 --> 21:32.793
Dr. Reynolds,

21:32.826 --> 21:34.595
aside from what he told you
under hypnosis,

21:34.628 --> 21:36.362
do you have
any other reason

21:36.396 --> 21:38.331
to believe he did not
commit these crimes?

21:38.364 --> 21:39.733
Well, as I said,

21:39.766 --> 21:42.335
I've studied the patterns
of serial killers.

21:42.368 --> 21:45.338
These people often have
some displaced anger.

21:45.371 --> 21:48.341
I didn't find Mr. Hinks
to have a lot of anger,

21:48.374 --> 21:49.375
if any.

21:49.409 --> 21:50.877
He's seen these killings

21:50.911 --> 21:53.446
on the front pages
of our newspapers,

21:53.479 --> 21:55.448
and he's somehow
convinced himself

21:55.481 --> 21:57.751
he is the object
of all these headlines.

21:57.784 --> 22:00.921
Ever know a patient to fake
being under hypnosis?

22:00.954 --> 22:02.689
I don't think Mr. Hinks
was faking--

22:02.723 --> 22:04.591
My question was,
ever know a patient

22:04.625 --> 22:06.893
to fake being under
hypnosis?

22:06.927 --> 22:08.829
Yes.

22:08.862 --> 22:11.464
And if this patient suffered
from a delusion, doctor,

22:11.497 --> 22:14.000
wouldn't he suffer
from the same delusion

22:14.034 --> 22:15.669
under hypnosis?

22:15.702 --> 22:18.038
Yes, usually the delusion
would persist under hypnosis.

22:18.071 --> 22:19.773
Didn't that
make you suspicious?

22:19.806 --> 22:21.642
I was extremely
suspicious, but--

22:21.675 --> 22:24.010
What is the I. Q.
of Mr. Hinks, if you know?

22:24.044 --> 22:26.012
It's high.

22:26.046 --> 22:27.781
And is it
your testimony, then,

22:27.814 --> 22:29.783
that you make no room
for the possibility

22:29.816 --> 22:31.685
that he faked
being under hypnosis

22:31.718 --> 22:33.754
to tell his little tale
of innocence?

22:33.787 --> 22:36.389
I not only considered it,
Mr. Hill,

22:36.422 --> 22:39.392
I at first suspected it,
but when he kept insisting

22:39.425 --> 22:41.762
that his lawyers not
declare him to be innocent,

22:41.795 --> 22:43.396
when he fired lawyers

22:43.429 --> 22:45.398
for endeavoring
to prove his innocence,

22:45.431 --> 22:47.701
I knew then
he couldn't be faking.

22:47.734 --> 22:49.636
Well, she's simply wrong.

22:49.670 --> 22:51.037
What more can I tell you?

22:51.071 --> 22:53.039
Dr. Gale,
did you consider

22:53.073 --> 22:54.641
that this could be
a false confession?

22:54.675 --> 22:56.610
It's one of the first things
that we look for,

22:56.643 --> 22:57.978
but in Mr. Hinks' case,

22:58.011 --> 23:00.514
I determined his confession
to be genuine.

23:00.547 --> 23:02.783
And on what did you base
this opinion, sir?

23:02.816 --> 23:04.685
I've been a clinical
and forensic psychologist

23:04.718 --> 23:06.486
for 33 years now.
That's what I do.

23:06.520 --> 23:08.421
And contrary
to Dr. Reynolds' findings,

23:08.454 --> 23:11.958
I consider Mr. Hinks
to be consumed with rage.

23:11.992 --> 23:15.061
He lived alone
with his mother growing up.

23:15.095 --> 23:16.797
Though not
physically abusive,

23:16.830 --> 23:18.765
she was
emotionally punishing.

23:18.799 --> 23:21.201
The gruesome acts
committed here--

23:21.234 --> 23:23.069
the dissection
of the bodies--

23:23.103 --> 23:24.938
these are acts of hatred.

23:24.971 --> 23:27.473
These murders are
very much about punishment.

23:27.508 --> 23:29.843
Dr. Gale, I'm going
to play for you

23:29.876 --> 23:31.978
a portion
of his confession.

23:32.012 --> 23:34.615
If I could have
figured out a way

23:34.648 --> 23:38.652
to dismember them alive,
I would have done so,

23:38.685 --> 23:43.890
but fear of getting caught
was a deterrent there.

23:43.924 --> 23:46.059
Still...

23:46.092 --> 23:49.796
I would have so loved to have
extended that look of pain

23:49.830 --> 23:51.898
in their faces--

23:51.932 --> 23:54.535
that look of horror.

23:54.568 --> 23:56.537
It's a thing of beauty--

23:56.570 --> 23:58.905
the look
on the face of a woman

23:58.939 --> 24:01.908
who knows
she's about to die.

24:01.942 --> 24:04.645
They write in the papers,
why do they do it?

24:04.678 --> 24:07.648
Why do these killers do it
over and over and over?

24:07.681 --> 24:10.551
It's that look.

24:10.584 --> 24:13.754
MAN: You think
you'll kill again?

24:13.787 --> 24:16.189
Oh, yes.

24:16.222 --> 24:21.662
I'll get out of this.
You just watch.

24:21.695 --> 24:25.231
And I'll know the joy
of that look again.

24:29.135 --> 24:31.672
Even if Hinks

24:31.705 --> 24:35.041
were to somehow learn
all about those crimes

24:35.075 --> 24:38.712
to the point of being able
to fool law enforcement,

24:38.745 --> 24:40.881
and that's an extremely
unlikely if,

24:40.914 --> 24:44.885
you cannot fake
a psychosis like that.

24:44.918 --> 24:46.252
Sitting at that table

24:46.286 --> 24:49.189
is the man
who mutilated those women.

24:56.563 --> 24:59.533
Well, you got
your wish, William.

24:59.566 --> 25:02.235
After watching
that last footage,

25:02.268 --> 25:04.805
I'm sure everyone
thinks you did it,

25:04.838 --> 25:06.206
including the jury.

25:06.239 --> 25:08.208
Other than lying to me,

25:08.241 --> 25:09.610
you've tried
an excellent case.

25:11.912 --> 25:14.915
You should both feel good
about yourselves.

25:14.948 --> 25:19.219
Do you truly appreciate
where you'll be going?

25:19.252 --> 25:21.788
In this life or the next?

25:21.822 --> 25:23.790
This one.

25:23.824 --> 25:26.159
I'm talking about
the maximum security hell,

25:26.192 --> 25:28.795
where prisoners
have special feelings

25:28.829 --> 25:31.331
for men
who mutilate women.

25:31.364 --> 25:36.336
Well, it's my turn now,
I suppose.

25:36.369 --> 25:39.940
I still would
like to testify.

25:39.973 --> 25:41.975
I don't see the harm
at this point.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.309
What else is left?

25:43.343 --> 25:45.579
Not much. We've got
an expert on tire tracks

25:45.612 --> 25:48.214
that could place his car
maybe in some of the areas.

25:48.248 --> 25:50.183
It's nothing.

25:50.216 --> 25:51.585
They'll establish
he has no alibi.

25:51.618 --> 25:53.587
Big deal--
he says that himself.

25:53.620 --> 25:55.088
We're almost done.

25:55.121 --> 25:56.857
Are you winning
or losing?

25:56.890 --> 25:59.259
Well, that depends
on the goal, Eugene.

25:59.292 --> 26:01.862
I think he's looking
at a conviction,

26:01.895 --> 26:04.731
but to the client,
that seems to be a victory.

26:04.765 --> 26:07.834
And why does he want
to testify, exactly?

26:07.868 --> 26:10.203
Because if my soul
is to be offered

26:10.236 --> 26:11.838
any chance at redemption,

26:11.872 --> 26:13.840
I must make
a full confession.

26:13.874 --> 26:16.843
LINDSAY:
And God would like you
to do that under oath?

26:16.877 --> 26:20.681
God would like me to be open
and notorious with my evil.

26:20.714 --> 26:21.948
Yes.

26:21.982 --> 26:24.785
What did you do
with the gloves?

26:24.818 --> 26:26.620
I'm sorry?

26:26.653 --> 26:28.288
The killer
always wore latex gloves

26:28.321 --> 26:30.223
to avoid leaving prints
or oils behind.

26:30.256 --> 26:32.358
On the night you were caught,
the gloves were never found.

26:32.392 --> 26:34.895
-What did you do with them?
-As I told the police,

26:34.928 --> 26:37.263
I have no actual memory
of how I disposed of them.

26:37.297 --> 26:39.265
And again,
as I told the police,

26:39.299 --> 26:40.667
if I were to guess,

26:40.701 --> 26:42.035
I threw them in the fire
and burnt them.

26:42.068 --> 26:43.870
Actually,
you didn't make that guess

26:43.904 --> 26:45.872
in your confession,
you made it much later

26:45.906 --> 26:48.208
after it was reported that
there was a fire burning.

26:48.241 --> 26:50.143
The police found
no residue of the gloves

26:50.176 --> 26:52.112
in the fireplace.
Did you know that?

26:52.145 --> 26:54.047
Is it possible nobody
could find the gloves

26:54.080 --> 26:56.016
because the real killer
took them?

26:56.049 --> 26:58.284
I am the real killer,
Ms. Dole.

26:58.318 --> 26:59.753
How come you didn't know

26:59.786 --> 27:01.387
the second victim
had cancer?

27:01.421 --> 27:02.422
Something which was never
released to the media,

27:02.455 --> 27:04.124
coincidentally,

27:04.157 --> 27:06.159
something you didn't know
when you confessed.

27:06.192 --> 27:08.294
I didn't give them
physicals, counsel.

27:08.328 --> 27:10.396
I just removed
their heads.

27:10.430 --> 27:12.766
This one's head
had a wig on it.

27:12.799 --> 27:15.168
You decapitated her but
didn't know she had a wig?

27:15.201 --> 27:17.070
Even the sickest
of criminals

27:17.103 --> 27:19.706
knows not to mess
with a woman's hair.

27:19.740 --> 27:22.142
What a clever answer.

27:22.175 --> 27:24.711
Women have a thing
about their nails, too.

27:24.745 --> 27:26.179
You messed with them.

27:26.212 --> 27:28.815
Actually, I never so much
as scraped a nail.

27:28.849 --> 27:31.718
I removed them
in perfect condition.

27:31.752 --> 27:33.086
What happened to them?

27:33.119 --> 27:35.355
I beg your pardon?

27:35.388 --> 27:37.791
You said in your confession
you took them as souvenirs.

27:37.824 --> 27:39.225
People keep souvenirs.
What did you do with them?

27:39.259 --> 27:40.894
That I won't tell.

27:40.927 --> 27:43.463
Come on, Mr. Hinks,
this is confession time.

27:43.496 --> 27:45.832
We're trying to redeem
a soul here.

27:45.866 --> 27:47.467
What'd you do with
the fingernails?

27:47.500 --> 27:51.204
There are some things
I will take to my grave,
that's one.

27:51.237 --> 27:53.473
You don't know where they are
because you never took them.

27:53.507 --> 27:54.775
I did.

27:54.808 --> 27:56.242
All of them?
Every victim?

27:56.276 --> 27:58.078
Every victim.

27:58.111 --> 28:00.346
What about the fingernails
on the last victim,

28:00.380 --> 28:02.916
Mr. Hinks? They went
the way of the gloves?

28:05.118 --> 28:09.089
I swallowed them.

28:11.091 --> 28:13.326
What about the fifth victim,
Mr. Hinks?

28:13.359 --> 28:15.361
Angela Barton--
you remember her?

28:15.395 --> 28:19.766
Pretty, quick-tempered,
lost her head easily.

28:19.800 --> 28:23.003
Clever again.
Did you remove
her fingernails?

28:23.036 --> 28:26.106
One by one-- made difficult
because she bit them.

28:26.139 --> 28:28.742
You didn't take her nails,
Mr. Hinks,

28:28.775 --> 28:30.276
not Angela Barton's.

28:30.310 --> 28:33.379
The police conceal
information for the purpose

28:33.413 --> 28:35.381
of flushing out
phony confessions.

28:35.415 --> 28:37.283
In your confession,

28:37.317 --> 28:39.385
you talked about removing
Ms. Barton's nails

28:39.419 --> 28:41.922
before you incised
the hands.

28:41.955 --> 28:44.024
The thing is, Mr. Hinks,
when you go to trial,

28:44.057 --> 28:46.026
the prosecution
has to hand over

28:46.059 --> 28:47.427
all exculpatory evidence,

28:47.460 --> 28:49.429
even the stuff
the police concealed,

28:49.462 --> 28:51.431
and what
I've now learned--

28:51.464 --> 28:54.034
the nails of Angela Barton
were never removed.

28:54.067 --> 28:56.036
It was reported
that they were,

28:56.069 --> 28:58.071
so you confessed
to doing it.

28:58.104 --> 29:02.075
So I forgot.

29:02.108 --> 29:05.078
It was four victims ago.
They blend.

29:05.111 --> 29:07.247
You forgot. You forgot
a lot of things, Mr. Hinks.

29:07.280 --> 29:10.183
You could never remember
the colors of carpets,

29:10.216 --> 29:12.185
the layouts of rooms,
the types of drapes...

29:12.218 --> 29:14.054
I was killing people.
You think I was going

29:14.087 --> 29:15.455
to take time out
to notice fabric?

29:15.488 --> 29:16.823
This killer
noticed everything.

29:16.857 --> 29:18.391
He was meticulous.

29:18.424 --> 29:20.927
Please don't talk about me
as if I were not in the room.

29:20.961 --> 29:22.829
What about
the tenth victim?

29:26.132 --> 29:28.101
There were nine.

29:28.134 --> 29:30.103
Nine reported.
There was a tenth,

29:30.136 --> 29:32.372
never confirmed to be
one of the serial victims

29:32.405 --> 29:34.908
because she died
by a gunshot wound.

29:34.941 --> 29:37.077
-Objection.
-Overruled.

29:37.110 --> 29:38.512
Her fingernails
were also pulled out,

29:38.545 --> 29:40.981
limbs and head amputated--
your work, Mr. Hinks?

29:41.014 --> 29:42.382
Objection!

29:42.415 --> 29:43.917
Ask that counsel not interrupt
or steer the witness.

29:43.950 --> 29:45.952
Mr. Hill, you will sit
and remain quiet.

29:45.986 --> 29:47.387
Your work, Mr. Hinks,

29:47.420 --> 29:49.489
or another killer
who likes fingernails?

29:52.258 --> 29:55.228
I didn't think the police
knew about that one.

29:55.261 --> 29:57.197
So it was your work?

30:00.333 --> 30:03.469
Your work, Mr. Hinks?

30:06.106 --> 30:07.440
Yes.

30:07.473 --> 30:10.476
Funny. I made it up.

30:12.378 --> 30:14.347
You're a fraud.

30:14.380 --> 30:16.082
You've never hurt anybody.

30:16.116 --> 30:18.184
I killed those people.

30:18.218 --> 30:19.419
No, you didn't.

30:19.452 --> 30:21.588
I killed those people,
Ms. Dole.

30:21.622 --> 30:23.456
Your doctor's discovered
you're delusional.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.358
You're just
an anonymous little man--

30:25.391 --> 30:27.894
I killed those women
as quickly and surely

30:27.928 --> 30:29.362
as I would kill you.

30:29.395 --> 30:30.363
Mr. Hinks.

30:30.396 --> 30:31.998
I did it!

30:32.032 --> 30:34.200
I'm famous.

30:34.234 --> 30:36.537
You see my pictures
in the papers

30:36.570 --> 30:38.104
because I did it!

30:38.138 --> 30:40.206
Mr. Hinks,
you will lower your voice.

30:40.240 --> 30:42.543
This is mine!

30:42.576 --> 30:44.377
I-I killed them,

30:44.410 --> 30:47.247
and you can't
take it away.

30:49.282 --> 30:52.519
You can't.

30:58.525 --> 31:00.561
You can't.

31:08.669 --> 31:11.638
Okay, Mr. Hinks.

31:11.672 --> 31:13.574
You win.

31:33.426 --> 31:34.961
Forgive me, Mr. Hinks.

31:34.995 --> 31:37.230
I was just trying
to decide

31:37.263 --> 31:39.232
whose performance
was better here--

31:39.265 --> 31:40.333
yours or Ms. Dole's.

31:40.366 --> 31:41.367
Objection.

31:41.401 --> 31:43.369
Sustained.

31:44.671 --> 31:47.674
I have nothing
for Mr. Hinks.

31:59.085 --> 32:02.956
I think maybe we've won.

32:02.989 --> 32:05.225
It's not over.

32:05.258 --> 32:07.393
You haven't
heard him close.

32:18.071 --> 32:19.740
LINDSAY:
No physical evidence,

32:19.773 --> 32:21.441
no witnesses--

32:21.474 --> 32:24.010
just a confession from
a paranoid schizophrenic man

32:24.044 --> 32:26.012
suffering from delusions,

32:26.046 --> 32:30.383
a man desperate to believe
he's something he's not.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.553
You heard
his treating psychologist.

32:32.586 --> 32:35.121
You saw him
in that witness chair.

32:35.155 --> 32:36.657
He's ill,

32:36.690 --> 32:40.661
but he's not the sick man
who committed those crimes.

32:40.694 --> 32:42.663
For this so-called confession,

32:42.696 --> 32:44.665
he was armed
only with information

32:44.698 --> 32:46.667
that had been published
somewhere,

32:46.700 --> 32:49.402
stuff that he'd cut out,
downloaded, printed,

32:49.435 --> 32:51.404
plastered all over his walls.

32:51.437 --> 32:53.607
The things that weren't
public information

32:53.640 --> 32:56.176
like the fingernails still being
on the fifth victim--

32:56.209 --> 32:58.244
oh, he somehow forgot that.

32:58.278 --> 33:02.082
Mr. Hinks,
as part of his illness,

33:02.115 --> 33:06.252
is desperate to believe
he's the one.

33:06.286 --> 33:08.522
The prosecution,
as a result of public pressure,

33:08.555 --> 33:11.457
is desperate to believe
he's the one.

33:11.491 --> 33:14.060
I think on some level
we all are,

33:14.094 --> 33:16.062
because we want
this sick person,

33:16.096 --> 33:18.532
whoever he is,
off the street.

33:18.565 --> 33:24.370
But if we really, truly want
this killer captured,

33:24.404 --> 33:26.807
we better send the message
to the police

33:26.840 --> 33:29.810
that they'd better
keep looking,

33:29.843 --> 33:34.214
because it's not
William Hinks.

33:54.701 --> 33:59.172
I have never been on a case
where the defense pled insanity

33:59.205 --> 34:01.575
only to then,
in the middle of trial,

34:01.608 --> 34:04.578
suddenly declare
that he didn't do it at all,

34:04.611 --> 34:06.580
and then to follow that,

34:06.613 --> 34:09.850
with the defendant taking
the stand to say that he did.

34:09.882 --> 34:11.652
Sounds crazy,

34:11.685 --> 34:14.387
but it isn't crazy,
ladies and gentlemen.

34:14.420 --> 34:18.692
It's brilliant and very
carefully orchestrated.

34:18.725 --> 34:23.429
We're dealing with a sick, dark,
but brilliant chess player,

34:23.463 --> 34:26.331
a man who met eight women--
eight different women--

34:26.366 --> 34:28.333
got admitted to their homes,

34:28.368 --> 34:31.170
murdered them,
leaving virtually no evidence--

34:31.204 --> 34:34.708
not a hair,
not a bead of sweat, nothing.

34:34.741 --> 34:37.277
Then he met his ninth victim,

34:37.310 --> 34:39.279
and though she let him in

34:39.312 --> 34:42.248
like the eight others had
before her,

34:42.282 --> 34:46.351
she was also able to set off
a silent alarm.

34:46.386 --> 34:49.623
Mr. Hinks still was able
to commit the murder

34:49.656 --> 34:52.292
and do his
immaculate clean-up,

34:52.324 --> 34:55.360
but when it came time to leave,
the police were coming,

34:55.395 --> 34:58.198
and this time
he had to take flight,

34:58.231 --> 35:01.735
to seek cover
in a neighboring basement,

35:01.768 --> 35:04.437
and this time he was caught.

35:04.470 --> 35:07.641
He knew the police
would search his apartment

35:07.674 --> 35:10.376
and find those clippings
and those web site printouts.

35:10.410 --> 35:12.813
He knew that he could offer
no alibis

35:12.846 --> 35:14.815
for those eight other killings.

35:14.848 --> 35:17.584
He knew that the police
would know

35:17.618 --> 35:19.553
they had the right guy.

35:19.586 --> 35:21.555
Well, to get out of this now,

35:21.588 --> 35:24.858
Mr. Hinks would have to be
at his most ingenious,
wouldn't he?

35:24.891 --> 35:26.860
So he gives a confession,

35:26.893 --> 35:28.862
careful to provide
most details,

35:28.895 --> 35:31.765
but also careful
to leave out a few,

35:31.798 --> 35:33.767
and then,
while under the pretense

35:33.800 --> 35:36.369
of being hypnotized
while being treated,

35:36.402 --> 35:41.274
he tells a different story--
a story of innocence,

35:41.307 --> 35:44.277
and he hopes that this therapist
will become his pawn.

35:44.310 --> 35:48.782
Well, Dr. Reynolds
is no pushover.

35:48.815 --> 35:50.450
She's a gifted psychologist,

35:50.483 --> 35:52.786
one likely capable
of detecting a sham,

35:52.819 --> 35:55.355
and though he had her
mostly convinced,

35:55.388 --> 35:57.357
he knew that
she remained doubtful.

35:57.390 --> 35:59.292
According to her own testimony,

35:59.325 --> 36:01.928
it was only after Mr. Hinks
fired his previous attorneys

36:01.962 --> 36:07.734
that she finally decided
he was not faking his delusions.

36:07.768 --> 36:11.471
He got her,
and he needed her.

36:11.505 --> 36:14.207
You see, to have any chance
of an acquittal,

36:14.240 --> 36:18.579
Mr. Hinks needed this therapist
to sell you,

36:18.612 --> 36:20.847
and in order to keep her
convinced enough,

36:20.881 --> 36:23.416
he had to keep insisting
that he did it,

36:23.449 --> 36:25.418
and he had to keep insisting

36:25.451 --> 36:27.420
that his lawyers
not say otherwise,

36:27.453 --> 36:31.592
all the while needing a lawyer
who would say otherwise,

36:31.625 --> 36:34.628
over his feigned protests.

36:36.697 --> 36:39.866
Enter Ms. Dole,
pawn number two.

36:39.900 --> 36:44.337
Mr. Hinks needed an attorney

36:44.370 --> 36:46.707
who would find a way
to plead not guilty,

36:46.740 --> 36:49.510
in spite of being told not to.

36:49.543 --> 36:51.878
Sound complicated? You bet.

36:51.912 --> 36:54.247
Hard to pull off? Absolutely.

36:54.280 --> 36:56.783
Far-fetched? Maybe.

36:56.817 --> 37:00.787
But let's consider what
he's pulled off before.

37:00.821 --> 37:04.525
Not many people can commit
eight murders

37:04.558 --> 37:06.727
without leaving a single clue.

37:06.760 --> 37:10.463
He did,
then he met his ninth,

37:10.496 --> 37:11.898
and we got him.

37:11.932 --> 37:15.368
We finally got him,

37:15.401 --> 37:17.538
and in order to get off,

37:17.571 --> 37:21.307
he would have to come up
with something masterful.

37:22.943 --> 37:25.411
He did.

37:25.445 --> 37:28.048
You want to give him
an Academy Award

37:28.081 --> 37:30.684
for his wrenching performance
on the witness stand,

37:30.717 --> 37:34.054
you do it, but don't you dare
give him an acquittal.

37:34.087 --> 37:35.756
Don't you dare.

37:35.789 --> 37:39.893
You don't want him out there
looking for number 10.

38:10.356 --> 38:12.358
How long?

38:12.392 --> 38:15.596
I expect this one
to take a while.

38:15.629 --> 38:17.330
It's close.

38:18.498 --> 38:21.702
His closing was good,
wasn't it?

38:21.735 --> 38:23.570
Extremely.

38:27.574 --> 38:30.677
He kind of sold me.

38:59.940 --> 39:03.777
Did you know I planned
to yank the insanity plea

39:03.810 --> 39:05.111
and go straight
not guilty?

39:05.145 --> 39:07.113
I had a pretty good idea.

39:08.915 --> 39:11.484
When you wouldn't
tell me the strategy,

39:11.518 --> 39:13.486
and you said I might
be testifying,

39:13.520 --> 39:15.856
I figured that's what
you were planning.

39:15.889 --> 39:19.693
What if I hadn't?
Wasn't that sort of a risk?

39:19.726 --> 39:21.695
Considering my plight,
Ms. Dole,

39:21.728 --> 39:24.097
I was in a position
to take risks.

39:24.130 --> 39:26.867
Besides, I was poised
to suffer a mental breakdown

39:26.900 --> 39:28.602
and at least secure
a mistrial

39:28.635 --> 39:29.803
if you stuck
with insanity.

39:29.836 --> 39:32.405
Why didn't you just
let me talk you

39:32.438 --> 39:33.974
into going not guilty
over your objection?

39:34.007 --> 39:35.876
Because Dr. Reynolds
was measuring me

39:35.909 --> 39:38.779
every single step
along the way.

39:38.812 --> 39:41.114
I had to cling
to my delusions.

39:41.147 --> 39:44.117
Without her completely sold,
I didn't stand a chance,

39:44.150 --> 39:46.152
and what perhaps
she didn't tell you--

39:46.186 --> 39:48.722
she wasn't completely sure.
She thought I was innocent,

39:48.755 --> 39:51.124
but her medical conclusions
were far more precarious

39:51.157 --> 39:53.126
than she ever let on.

39:53.159 --> 39:55.128
I couldn't risk losing her.

39:55.161 --> 39:58.532
Okay, why not
feign improvement?

39:58.565 --> 40:00.867
Take medication, then you
could have just testified

40:00.901 --> 40:02.803
and said,
"I thought I killed them,

40:02.836 --> 40:03.837
but now I know I didn't."

40:03.870 --> 40:05.438
Far too self-serving.

40:05.471 --> 40:07.440
When you murder
nine people,

40:07.473 --> 40:09.843
the jury is not looking
for a reason

40:09.876 --> 40:11.444
to let you go.

40:11.477 --> 40:14.447
Things have to be perfect.

40:17.984 --> 40:20.587
If you get off,

40:20.621 --> 40:22.623
you're going to
kill again?

40:24.157 --> 40:26.727
Mr. Berluti,

40:26.760 --> 40:29.129
if I tell you
I'm about to kill again,

40:29.162 --> 40:31.598
you don't have
to honor privilege,

40:31.632 --> 40:35.869
and you can repeat
everything I'm telling you now,

40:35.902 --> 40:37.738
but nice try.

40:37.771 --> 40:41.975
So things went just
as you planned in there.

40:42.008 --> 40:43.610
I certainly didn't plan

40:43.644 --> 40:46.547
for Mr. Hill to be so good
in his closing.

40:46.580 --> 40:51.918
If he convinced you,
I hardly feel overconfident.

40:51.952 --> 40:55.188
What about the latex gloves
on the last victim?

40:55.221 --> 40:58.024
Burned in the fireplace.

40:58.058 --> 41:01.027
The police are shoddy.

41:01.061 --> 41:02.996
(knock on door)

41:03.029 --> 41:06.600
Verdict.

41:23.316 --> 41:25.652
JUDGE WHITE: All right.

41:25.686 --> 41:27.588
Mr. Hinks,
will you please rise?

41:27.621 --> 41:30.056
Madame foreperson,
the jury has a final verdict?

41:30.090 --> 41:32.659
We do, your honor.

41:32.693 --> 41:33.894
What say you?

41:33.927 --> 41:36.162
Commonwealth
vs. William Hinks--

41:36.196 --> 41:38.665
counts one through nine

41:38.699 --> 41:40.901
of murder
in the first degree,

41:40.934 --> 41:42.903
we find the defendant
William Hinks...

41:42.936 --> 41:44.838
not guilty.

41:44.871 --> 41:48.008
(gallery reacts loudly)

41:48.041 --> 41:49.776
JUDGE WHITE: All right.

41:49.810 --> 41:52.746
Members of the jury,
your service here is completed.

41:52.779 --> 41:56.917
Mr. Hinks, you have been
declared not guilty.

41:56.950 --> 42:00.220
You are free to go.
This court is adjourned.

42:00.253 --> 42:03.557
(bangs gavel)

42:08.762 --> 42:11.331
I might go out
the back way.

42:11.364 --> 42:13.567
Yes. Thank you.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.068
Thank you both.

42:15.101 --> 42:16.937
MAN: Mr. Hinks,
about the fingernails, sir?

42:16.970 --> 42:18.805
JIMMY: Can you keep
them back, please?

42:18.839 --> 42:20.807
-Unbelievable.
-Yeah.

42:20.841 --> 42:22.275
Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

42:22.308 --> 42:24.811
I suppose your heart
was in the right place.

42:24.845 --> 42:27.247
Yeah. Listen, William,
this gets you out,

42:27.280 --> 42:29.850
but you still need
treatment.

42:29.883 --> 42:31.852
Will you let me
help you?

42:31.885 --> 42:35.255
Let me think about that,
all right?

42:35.288 --> 42:37.824
You really need
to get help.

42:37.858 --> 42:41.294
I'll call you.

42:46.366 --> 42:49.302
You did it, Lindsay.

42:49.335 --> 42:51.237
Incredible.

42:51.271 --> 42:53.640
Were you really sure
he was innocent?

42:53.674 --> 42:56.910
Was I sure? No.

42:56.943 --> 42:59.646
I'll probably never be
100% sure.

42:59.680 --> 43:01.314
He knew that.

43:01.347 --> 43:03.016
Sorry?

43:05.218 --> 43:06.787
Nothing.

43:06.820 --> 43:08.622
Well, he's not
out of the woods

43:08.655 --> 43:09.990
unless he gets treatment.

43:10.023 --> 43:12.058
Let him go, Jeannie.

43:12.092 --> 43:13.794
He's ill, Lindsay.

43:13.827 --> 43:16.897
Everything doesn't just end
with a trial, sorry to say.

43:16.930 --> 43:18.665
Especially this one.

43:18.699 --> 43:21.101
Let him go.

43:39.786 --> 43:42.155
â™ª (theme)

44:05.411 --> 44:06.880
You stinker!
