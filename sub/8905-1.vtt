01:16.516 --> 01:18.040
All right, guys, line up.

01:18.385 --> 01:22.685
Rudy, take that stupid helmet off.
You're not even playing.

01:23.724 --> 01:28.457
Me and Pete, we're Notre Dame.
You guys, you're Michigan.

01:28.662 --> 01:30.357
Okay, huddle up. Come on.

01:31.698 --> 01:35.464
- Same play. I'll hand it off to you.
- Okay. I got it.

01:36.370 --> 01:38.270
One, two, three, breakl

01:38.572 --> 01:40.267
Come on, Rudy.
Get on the ball.

01:41.408 --> 01:43.467
Readyl 42, blowl

01:43.777 --> 01:44.641
Set, hut!

01:44.845 --> 01:46.870
One, 1000. Two, 1000.

01:48.615 --> 01:50.048
Oh, no! Oh!

01:50.250 --> 01:51.717
I told you to cut inside.

01:51.918 --> 01:53.283
Do it right.

01:54.388 --> 01:55.218
Come on, Todd.

01:55.422 --> 01:56.616
Try it again. Let's go.

01:56.823 --> 01:58.950
All right, Todd. Same thing, okay?

01:59.159 --> 02:00.251
Break.

02:00.460 --> 02:02.394
- Ready?
- Let's go. Get on the ball.

02:02.596 --> 02:04.530
I'm sick of being all-time center.

02:04.731 --> 02:07.029
- What?
- I'm sick of being all-time center.

02:07.234 --> 02:08.428
I told you five times.

02:08.634 --> 02:11.035
You can't play anything
else but that.

02:11.238 --> 02:12.705
You're too small.

02:12.906 --> 02:15.397
- I can too.
- You guys, I'm going. I'm sorry.

02:15.609 --> 02:16.906
- I gotta go.
- We need you.

02:17.110 --> 02:19.340
- Come on.
- Let Rudy play in my place.

02:19.546 --> 02:21.446
Good idea, Frank. Let Rudy play.

02:21.648 --> 02:22.876
Come on. Why not?

02:23.083 --> 02:25.677
Okay, you can rush the passer.

02:26.987 --> 02:28.318
All right, Rudy.

02:30.157 --> 02:31.124
We gotta get them.

02:31.324 --> 02:32.518
- Break.
- Okay.

02:33.293 --> 02:34.225
Okay, let's go.

02:34.428 --> 02:35.554
Ready!

02:35.762 --> 02:37.559
Set, hut!

02:37.798 --> 02:39.390
Get him, Rudy. Get him.

02:43.937 --> 02:46.462
- The snow, for the touchdown.
- Yeah!

02:46.673 --> 02:47.970
All right!

02:49.076 --> 02:50.805
What a spaz.

02:51.611 --> 02:53.442
All right! We won, guys!

02:53.647 --> 02:55.478
Oh, yeah!

03:45.132 --> 03:47.066
- There you go.
- Thanks.

03:47.267 --> 03:49.701
Pete, you got your own home?

03:49.903 --> 03:52.770
- Last time I looked.
- You're welcome here anytime.

03:52.973 --> 03:55.100
Excuse me, young lady. Who are you?

03:55.308 --> 03:56.275
Sherry Walinski.

03:56.476 --> 03:58.000
- Bob's kid?
- Rudy's girlfriend.

03:58.211 --> 03:59.303
She is not.

03:59.513 --> 04:00.537
Yes, I am.

04:02.983 --> 04:06.009
- Everybody has a job at the mill.
- But I don't want that.

04:06.219 --> 04:11.088
Where else you gonna get 5 bucks
an hour? You got union protection.

04:11.291 --> 04:14.124
You got relatives watching
your front and your back.

04:14.327 --> 04:16.158
Tell me where you'll find this...

04:16.363 --> 04:19.332
...and God be with you.
- But, Dad, Pat's going there...

04:19.533 --> 04:22.764
- You gonna give me indigestion here?
- Leave the boy alone.

04:22.969 --> 04:25.460
But this boy can go off on his own.
You heard him.

04:25.672 --> 04:27.333
That's enough.

04:28.842 --> 04:32.141
Has anybody else got anything to say
before I start this meal?

04:34.047 --> 04:36.982
After high school, I'm gonna
play football at Notre Dame.

04:39.152 --> 04:40.744
Play football at Notre Dame?

04:42.189 --> 04:44.214
And I'll buy a mansion
on Lake Shore Drive.

04:44.624 --> 04:45.716
Rudy...

04:56.436 --> 04:58.836
What are we watching? Channel 7.

05:00.340 --> 05:04.174
- Don't you want something to drink?
- That's okay. Thanks.

05:09.149 --> 05:10.844
- Mr. Ruettiger?
- Yeah, Pete.

05:11.051 --> 05:14.452
At halftime, could we watch
some of the Indiana-Purdue game?

05:15.856 --> 05:18.848
There's only one team we watch
in this house, right?

05:19.059 --> 05:20.253
Right.

05:29.469 --> 05:32.734
And I want the ends in there fast,
every play, every play.

05:32.939 --> 05:34.304
We're under control.

05:34.507 --> 05:37.670
Any men in the backfield,
analyze before you move.

05:37.878 --> 05:40.972
If they throw a forward pass,
see the ball in the air...

05:41.181 --> 05:43.445
...and then go and get it.
When we get it...

05:43.650 --> 05:46.710
...that's when we go on offense.
That's when we go to them.

05:46.920 --> 05:50.151
We're going inside and outside them,
inside and outside them.

05:50.357 --> 05:52.791
We'll get them and
keep them on the run.

05:52.993 --> 05:56.053
We won't pass unless our
secondary comes up too close.

05:56.263 --> 05:59.699
But don't forget, we'll get them
on the run and go, go, go, go!

05:59.900 --> 06:02.095
Don't stop until we're
over the goal line.

06:02.302 --> 06:05.032
Don't forget men, today's
the day we're gonna win.

06:05.238 --> 06:09.231
They can't beat us in the fight and
we'll fight, fight, fight, fight!

06:09.442 --> 06:11.933
What do you say, men? Yeah!

06:20.086 --> 06:21.713
Ruettiger! Hey, Rudy!

06:21.922 --> 06:24.356
Kill that halfback.
Move that secondary back.

06:24.557 --> 06:27.583
- We gotta get ready for those...
- Come on, offense. Break!

06:31.598 --> 06:33.361
Black, 80!

06:34.801 --> 06:36.496
Set, hut!

06:40.206 --> 06:42.800
- Bring it on down. Come on!
- All right, let's go.

06:44.577 --> 06:46.238
Come on, Pete. Come on, buddy.

06:46.446 --> 06:48.107
I didn't hurt you, did I?

06:51.184 --> 06:52.879
Take a knee, guys.

06:54.587 --> 06:55.747
Listen up.

06:55.956 --> 06:59.119
You seniors, this is
your last practice.

06:59.793 --> 07:03.889
And with the exception of
Thomas, Lee, Bo...

07:04.364 --> 07:06.832
...Sypitch, you get on the weights...

07:07.033 --> 07:10.901
...tomorrow night will be the last
time you put on a football uniform.

07:12.038 --> 07:15.064
You know these last four years
have gone by too fast.

07:16.176 --> 07:17.507
They always do.

07:19.112 --> 07:20.977
And I gotta tell you guys...

07:21.181 --> 07:24.947
...that I really appreciate
the hard work and effort...

07:25.151 --> 07:28.279
...that you've given to me,
to the coaches...

07:28.488 --> 07:30.251
...and to the Hilltoppers.

07:31.157 --> 07:32.385
As a reward...

07:32.592 --> 07:34.856
...I'll give each
one of you seniors...

07:35.695 --> 07:40.189
...one final hit on me and
my friend down there.

07:40.400 --> 07:42.732
All right. Seniors, stay here.

07:42.936 --> 07:46.702
Underclassmen, two lines,
five yards apart. Let's go!

07:56.883 --> 07:58.748
You're first, McConnell!

07:58.952 --> 08:02.251
Give me your best shot!
Remember, it's gonna be your last!

08:08.828 --> 08:09.920
Good shot!

08:10.130 --> 08:11.062
Shower room.

08:12.332 --> 08:13.993
Constantino!

08:14.534 --> 08:16.058
Come on, David!

08:23.476 --> 08:24.738
Ruettiger!

08:40.326 --> 08:42.020
Okay, Rudy. Okay.

08:43.063 --> 08:45.429
Hey, Rudy, we're gonna miss you.

08:49.169 --> 08:50.500
Come on, Pete!

09:02.348 --> 09:04.373
I can't believe it's over.

09:12.392 --> 09:14.622
The bicameral legislature
originated...

09:15.095 --> 09:18.531
...not in the United States,
but where?

09:20.233 --> 09:22.030
Rudy, Rudy.

09:24.270 --> 09:27.433
Mr. Ruettiger, would you be
interested in joining us?

09:29.175 --> 09:31.473
- The House and the Senate...
- Don't even try.

09:32.745 --> 09:37.546
If I were giving out grades for
daydreaming, you'd be getting an A.

09:37.750 --> 09:40.048
But in civics, you're failing.

09:40.253 --> 09:42.187
You see, ladies and gentlemen...

09:42.388 --> 09:45.186
...the problem with dreamers
is, they usually aren't doers.

09:45.725 --> 09:49.320
Their achievements are
grand up here...

09:49.529 --> 09:52.987
...but here where it counts,
they fall short.

09:54.200 --> 09:59.001
Now, the bicameral legislature
originated... Hold up.

09:59.205 --> 10:00.866
I have an announcement.

10:01.908 --> 10:06.845
"If you are a student interested in
the University of Notre Dame...

10:07.046 --> 10:11.312
...a bus will be leaving here
at 10 a.m. Saturday, December 15th...

10:11.518 --> 10:14.078
...for a one-day guided
tour of the campus.

10:14.287 --> 10:18.519
Please sign up by Wednesday,
November 5th."

10:38.211 --> 10:40.839
And Raciniak, good.

10:41.281 --> 10:43.374
Whoa, wait!

10:43.583 --> 10:44.982
Where are you going?

10:45.585 --> 10:47.075
I'm going to see Notre Dame.

10:47.287 --> 10:49.380
Do you have some friends
in South Bend?

10:51.090 --> 10:54.025
- No.
- Then there must be some other reason.

10:56.563 --> 10:59.760
When you announced it in class,
I thought anybody could go.

10:59.966 --> 11:04.369
I'm sorry. This bus is for students
who want to attend the university.

11:04.571 --> 11:06.539
It's not a sightseeing tour.

11:09.209 --> 11:11.234
Maybe someday I'll go to school there.

11:13.580 --> 11:16.981
- Father Joseph, take over for me.
- Of course.

11:18.952 --> 11:20.112
Rudy...

11:20.486 --> 11:24.422
...you don't have the grades for Joliet
Community, much less Notre Dame.

11:25.491 --> 11:27.618
The secret to happiness
in this life...

11:27.827 --> 11:31.888
...is to be grateful for the gifts
the good Lord has bestowed upon us.

11:33.032 --> 11:34.192
Rudy...

11:34.400 --> 11:37.096
...not everyone is meant
to go to college.

12:16.409 --> 12:17.307
Dad, wait up!

12:18.011 --> 12:19.911
What about this order?

12:20.113 --> 12:22.946
We have to change
the rollers on number 13.

12:23.149 --> 12:24.582
- Thirteen?
- Yeah.

12:24.784 --> 12:27.514
All right, we'll have the crane
ready for you, okay?

12:28.221 --> 12:29.552
Hey, Rudy.

12:29.789 --> 12:30.915
Rudy!

12:34.294 --> 12:36.125
You were late again today?

12:36.996 --> 12:38.395
You were late?

12:39.098 --> 12:40.463
Get serious.

12:40.667 --> 12:42.601
No special days here.

12:53.279 --> 12:54.576
What is today?

12:54.781 --> 12:57.614
- Friday.
- No, no, I mean the date.

12:58.484 --> 12:59.314
August 23rd.

13:00.520 --> 13:02.010
And that is...?

13:02.689 --> 13:04.088
My birthday.

13:04.657 --> 13:07.490
Twenty-two big ones!

13:07.960 --> 13:10.258
Pete, it's starting to go by too fast.

13:11.497 --> 13:13.988
Well, I didn't
have time to wrap it, but...

13:14.200 --> 13:16.259
- Go ahead, open it.
- You shouldn't have.

13:30.316 --> 13:32.045
This is fantastic.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.844
Where did you find this?

13:36.055 --> 13:39.718
I saw it in this surplus store and
I said, "That's gotta be yours."

13:40.259 --> 13:41.954
This is unbelievable.

13:42.995 --> 13:45.725
Pete, I don't know how
I'm ever gonna thank you.

13:53.005 --> 13:54.267
How's it look?

13:55.541 --> 13:57.133
You were born to wear it.

14:03.149 --> 14:04.138
Do you know Ara...

14:04.350 --> 14:08.844
...is the only coach in Notre Dame
history who encourages walk-on players?

14:09.088 --> 14:12.285
You probably know more about
the team than half the players.

14:12.658 --> 14:14.489
I can't wait to get there.

14:16.062 --> 14:17.996
Guess how much money I have saved up?

14:18.698 --> 14:19.790
Twenty?

14:21.167 --> 14:22.691
Eighty? Fifty?

14:22.902 --> 14:24.062
1000 dollars.

14:28.174 --> 14:29.835
That's a good start!

14:35.081 --> 14:37.777
You're the only one who ever
took me serious, Pete.

14:40.353 --> 14:42.844
Well, you know what
my dad always said.

14:43.055 --> 14:45.523
"Having dreams is what
makes life tolerable."

14:56.068 --> 14:58.036
- 2-2-0-5.
- 2-2-0-9.

14:58.237 --> 15:00.671
That's 2-2-0-9.
That's the house, Rudy!

15:00.873 --> 15:02.397
Isn't it cute?

15:02.608 --> 15:03.939
We can afford this.

15:04.143 --> 15:06.703
And know what else it has?
Wall-to-wall carpeting.

15:06.913 --> 15:09.575
It has a fireplace.

15:10.683 --> 15:13.709
And a big kitchen.

15:13.920 --> 15:15.820
It's close to the schools.

15:17.523 --> 15:18.683
What's wrong?

15:19.358 --> 15:20.552
Nothing.

15:23.296 --> 15:26.891
It's great, Sherry. It's great.
You did a great job.

15:31.704 --> 15:32.932
Look, buddy...

15:33.272 --> 15:35.069
...I've put in my time.

15:36.576 --> 15:39.136
I've been very patient
waiting for us to save up...

15:39.345 --> 15:41.939
...so we could get married
and do this right.

15:43.182 --> 15:44.479
You owe me.

15:45.384 --> 15:46.408
Come on.

15:48.087 --> 15:49.884
I think you're gonna like it.

15:52.124 --> 15:53.591
Hey, Joe, what do you know?

15:54.760 --> 15:58.423
- Can I get another beer down here?
- Sure. Coming right up.

15:58.965 --> 16:00.956
What are you doing tomorrow night?

16:01.167 --> 16:02.464
A little TV.

16:02.869 --> 16:06.498
Coach Parseghian is speaking at the
Chicago Grid Iron Club. Wanna go?

16:06.706 --> 16:09.072
Sure. If Rhonda
lets me stay out late.

16:09.275 --> 16:12.369
Tell her the D train gets
back no later than 10:30...

16:12.578 --> 16:15.206
Ara Parseghian? You just
can't give it up, can you?

16:15.414 --> 16:17.848
He's the greatest coach
in the country, Frank.

16:18.417 --> 16:21.045
Are you gonna kiss his autographed
picture every night?

16:21.254 --> 16:25.054
- What is your problem?
- Or maybe he'll let you wipe his ass.

16:25.258 --> 16:28.227
- Why don't you leave him alone?
- Mind your own business.

16:28.594 --> 16:32.963
As long as my brother talks this crazy
Notre Dame shit, he deserves this.

16:33.165 --> 16:35.861
Hey, you were a pretty big
Notre Dame fan.

16:36.636 --> 16:39.002
I used to collect baseball cards too.

16:40.640 --> 16:41.572
Forget about it.

16:43.442 --> 16:46.411
You know what Coach Gillespie
said about you, Frank?

16:47.113 --> 16:49.206
He said you had a lot of talent.

16:49.415 --> 16:52.509
But your problem was,
you were too afraid of getting hit.

16:52.718 --> 16:54.310
You had no guts.

16:54.921 --> 16:56.286
Go to hell, Pete.

16:56.989 --> 16:58.923
- Come on.
- It's okay.

17:01.193 --> 17:04.821
He used to tell me if you had one
half of Rudy's heart and desire...

17:05.031 --> 17:07.396
...you could have been
all-conference.

17:08.467 --> 17:10.492
He said you were a pussy.

17:14.574 --> 17:15.404
Frank!

17:20.413 --> 17:21.903
Come on, Frank.

17:24.183 --> 17:25.012
Rudy!

17:25.217 --> 17:26.844
- Rudy! Rudy!
- All right!

17:27.053 --> 17:28.077
That's enough!

17:28.287 --> 17:29.948
Do you hear me?!

17:30.156 --> 17:31.555
That's enough!

17:35.261 --> 17:36.956
Frank, good!

17:40.900 --> 17:42.595
Don't nothing ever change?

17:44.770 --> 17:46.465
Throw them out, Mary Ann.

17:53.346 --> 17:57.510
You didn't have to get into it
with Frank. I can take care of myself.

17:57.717 --> 18:00.880
I know you can.
That was between him and me!

18:01.387 --> 18:04.550
Ever since he started working here,
he's been pissed off.

18:04.757 --> 18:07.419
Because he's not the same
kind of god around here...

18:07.627 --> 18:09.686
...that he was in high school.

18:16.669 --> 18:18.000
We got a breakout!

18:32.385 --> 18:33.716
Rudy, I need more water!

18:34.720 --> 18:35.914
I'm not getting any!

18:36.622 --> 18:38.522
Try another valve!

18:42.561 --> 18:43.926
I'm not getting any, Pete!

18:45.698 --> 18:47.325
Come on, goddamn it.

18:48.100 --> 18:51.866
There's no pressure in the line.
We need to get out of here!

18:52.304 --> 18:54.204
Turn something!

18:58.010 --> 18:59.534
Pete!

19:18.664 --> 19:20.029
Let us pray.

19:21.534 --> 19:26.471
O, God, who alone are ever
merciful and sparing of punishment...

19:26.739 --> 19:31.233
...humbly we pray You in behalf of
the soul of Your servant, Peter...

19:31.444 --> 19:35.005
...whom You have commanded to
go forth today from this world.

19:35.214 --> 19:39.878
Do not hand him over to the enemy,
and do not forget him forever...

19:40.386 --> 19:44.288
...but command that this soul
be taken up by the holy angels...

19:44.590 --> 19:47.616
...and brought home to Paradise.
So that, since he hoped...

19:47.827 --> 19:51.319
...and believed in You, he may not
undergo the punishments of Hell...

19:51.530 --> 19:54.624
- I'm so sorry. He was a friend.
- Thank you.

19:54.834 --> 19:56.927
Through Christ our Lord. Amen.

20:24.029 --> 20:25.360
You okay?

20:25.965 --> 20:27.523
You wanna just go home?

20:31.003 --> 20:32.937
I'm going to South Bend.

20:33.873 --> 20:35.306
Now is not the time.

20:35.875 --> 20:40.812
If I don't go now, I'll never be any
good for you or for me or anybody.

20:46.719 --> 20:47.845
I'm sorry.

20:51.357 --> 20:52.346
Well...

20:55.961 --> 20:58.953
...if you have to go, then
you'll have to go alone.

21:01.901 --> 21:03.027
I know.

21:06.005 --> 21:07.597
I'm sorry.

21:36.602 --> 21:37.762
Dad.

21:38.971 --> 21:40.495
What are you doing here?

21:49.949 --> 21:52.110
You can take a couple of weeks off.

22:09.401 --> 22:13.030
Your grandfather saved
all of his life...

22:13.239 --> 22:15.707
...to bring the family
to this country.

22:17.676 --> 22:21.510
He got a good job in the stockyards.
He had a nice little house...

22:21.714 --> 22:23.477
...South Chicago.

22:26.418 --> 22:28.750
I was about 12.

22:32.892 --> 22:36.726
Somebody sold him on the idea
he ought to move to the country...

22:37.496 --> 22:39.464
...and become a dairy farmer.

22:45.971 --> 22:47.097
Well...

22:47.373 --> 22:51.207
...he buys some land, you know,
and gets a couple hundred cows.

22:53.979 --> 22:57.779
Within five months, every one of
those cows was dead with disease.

23:02.655 --> 23:04.282
It was the Depression.

23:05.824 --> 23:07.451
Couldn't sell the land.

23:10.229 --> 23:11.594
There was no work.

23:14.867 --> 23:16.300
So one day...

23:17.736 --> 23:19.203
...he took off.

23:21.640 --> 23:23.107
Didn't come back.

23:25.978 --> 23:28.310
My brothers and me, we split up...

23:28.514 --> 23:31.142
...to live with friends and relatives.

23:37.756 --> 23:40.384
Chasing a stupid dream...

23:41.160 --> 23:46.029
...causes nothing but you and
everyone around you heartache.

23:48.867 --> 23:51.597
Notre Dame is for rich kids...

23:52.037 --> 23:53.902
...smart kids...

23:54.573 --> 23:58.031
...great athletes. It's not for us.

23:59.278 --> 24:00.768
You're a Ruettiger.

24:01.513 --> 24:05.711
There's nothing wrong with that.
You can have a damn nice life.

24:06.652 --> 24:09.644
Frank is gonna take over
plant number two.

24:09.888 --> 24:12.482
A couple years, he'll make
more than me and Johnny.

24:12.791 --> 24:14.850
He's in charge of
the expansion program.

24:15.060 --> 24:18.223
I don't wanna be Frank or John.

24:53.599 --> 24:57.262
Excuse me, I need to see somebody
about going to school here.

24:57.703 --> 24:58.829
Now?

24:59.138 --> 25:02.505
Admissions office doesn't open
for another couple of hours yet.

25:03.642 --> 25:06.509
There's gotta be somebody
I can talk to now.

25:06.979 --> 25:08.037
Please?

25:08.447 --> 25:13.384
Well, you could talk to a priest.
Maybe that's what you need, son.

25:14.653 --> 25:16.553
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

25:17.523 --> 25:18.820
Just a minute.

26:28.327 --> 26:29.487
Mr. Ruettiger?

26:29.695 --> 26:32.129
- Rudy.
- I'm Father Cavanaugh.

26:35.367 --> 26:39.064
How long have you thought
about this decision?

26:40.272 --> 26:42.001
For as long as I can remember...

26:42.207 --> 26:46.303
Have you taken the proper steps,
investigated the process?

26:46.512 --> 26:50.710
- Yes. I have more to learn, but...
- Are you fully aware...

26:50.916 --> 26:53.680
...of the sacrifices
you'll have to make?

26:55.053 --> 26:56.145
I am.

26:56.822 --> 26:58.619
I'll do whatever it takes.

27:01.493 --> 27:03.222
What brought you here today?

27:04.830 --> 27:08.129
I just came from my best friend's
funeral. He said that...

27:08.333 --> 27:09.732
Of course.

27:09.935 --> 27:11.800
What do you mean, "Of course"?

27:12.437 --> 27:14.462
Well, it's very common for people...

27:14.673 --> 27:17.904
...suffering a crisis to seek
escape into the cloth.

27:18.110 --> 27:20.670
- We recommend a grieving...
- Escape into the cloth?

27:20.879 --> 27:23.143
That's just an expression
that we use...

27:23.348 --> 27:27.444
...for those who are running away from
emotional or psychological pain...

27:27.653 --> 27:30.588
...by choosing priesthood.

27:32.057 --> 27:34.116
You think I want to become a priest?

27:36.562 --> 27:37.859
Don't you?

27:38.597 --> 27:41.760
Nothing against being a priest,
but I don't think it's for me.

27:43.402 --> 27:44.801
Why are you here?

27:45.571 --> 27:48.039
I want to go to school at Notre Dame.

27:52.377 --> 27:53.742
Well, have you applied?

27:54.146 --> 27:57.479
No, my grades have never been
very good, even though I tried.

27:57.683 --> 28:01.676
But I'll try harder. I'll study
20 hours a day if I have to.

28:01.887 --> 28:04.913
This university,
it's not for everybody.

28:06.525 --> 28:09.790
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to go to school here.

28:09.995 --> 28:14.728
And ever since I was a kid,
everyone said it couldn't be done.

28:16.268 --> 28:20.728
My whole life, people have been telling
me what I could do and couldn't do.

28:20.939 --> 28:24.500
I've always listened to them,
believed in what they said.

28:27.446 --> 28:29.641
I don't want to do that anymore.

28:33.018 --> 28:34.883
Okay, Mr. Rudy.

28:36.255 --> 28:37.654
Here's the deal...

28:38.957 --> 28:43.894
...Holy Cross Junior College is nearby.
I can get you one semester there.

28:45.063 --> 28:48.294
You make grades,
you get another semester.

28:48.500 --> 28:50.127
Maybe with a good GPA...

28:50.335 --> 28:53.532
...you might have a chance
of getting into Notre Dame.

30:37.909 --> 30:38.807
Hey, kid!

30:41.713 --> 30:43.578
You're not supposed to be here!

30:45.050 --> 30:47.883
Hey, this place is really
something else, huh?

30:49.287 --> 30:52.984
Someday, I'm gonna come out of that
tunnel and run onto this field!

30:53.191 --> 30:55.125
Well, it ain't gonna be this day.

30:58.563 --> 31:01.191
I'm here to play football
for the Irish.

31:02.033 --> 31:04.501
Coach Parseghian know about it?

31:07.339 --> 31:08.931
No, not yet.

31:09.908 --> 31:12.468
Well, maybe you best tell him first.

31:13.879 --> 31:15.506
Yeah, you're right.

31:15.714 --> 31:17.409
Yeah, that's what I should do.

31:18.483 --> 31:19.711
Thanks.

31:20.285 --> 31:21.718
I'll see you around.

31:25.190 --> 31:26.418
Is he expecting you?

31:26.625 --> 31:27.557
This'll just take a second.

31:28.193 --> 31:29.854
- Now just a moment...
- Coach?

31:30.061 --> 31:33.121
- Can I talk to you for a second?
- I'm sorry, coach, I tried.

31:33.865 --> 31:37.767
- No, it's all right. I've got it.
- Shall I close the door?

31:38.203 --> 31:40.694
- How can I help you, son?
- I'm Rudy Ruettiger.

31:42.474 --> 31:45.102
I'm here to talk about playing
football for Notre Dame.

31:45.343 --> 31:47.811
Our walk-on tryout date
was two weeks ago.

31:48.413 --> 31:52.747
I'm not talking about this year.
I was thinking about next springtime.

31:52.951 --> 31:54.816
Are you a student here?

31:55.220 --> 31:59.156
No. I'm at Holy Cross.
But I'm gonna be a student here.

31:59.357 --> 32:04.294
I've been a Notre Dame fan for as long
as I can remember, since I was little.

32:05.063 --> 32:08.794
In high school, I started...
Is it all right if I sit down?

32:09.568 --> 32:11.934
In high school,
I started at cornerback.

32:13.438 --> 32:17.602
I wasn't the quickest guy on the team
or the biggest...

32:17.809 --> 32:19.538
...but I lead in tackles.

32:20.011 --> 32:21.911
But anyway...

32:22.514 --> 32:25.506
...I've been working at a steel mill
for about four years.

32:25.717 --> 32:27.878
And I've been saving up my money.

32:28.253 --> 32:31.552
And I've been planning on
coming here. But...

32:32.324 --> 32:35.122
My friend Pete really understood
what my dream was.

32:35.327 --> 32:37.795
And he told me not to
waste any more time.

32:38.730 --> 32:41.198
But I don't know.
For some reason, I couldn't...

32:42.033 --> 32:44.593
See, he died in an accident on Friday.

32:45.770 --> 32:48.170
And I came here right after
the funeral.

32:48.740 --> 32:50.105
You see what I mean?

32:50.308 --> 32:51.502
Son...

32:52.744 --> 32:54.735
...I think you're in the wrong office.

32:55.347 --> 32:56.609
Come on, now.

32:57.883 --> 32:59.111
I don't understand.

32:59.317 --> 33:02.514
You might want to go and talk
to Father Cavanaugh.

33:02.721 --> 33:06.350
I talked to Father Cavanaugh.
He got me into Holy Cross.

33:06.558 --> 33:07.582
He did?

33:07.792 --> 33:10.727
He said that if I got good enough
grades at Holy Cross...

33:10.929 --> 33:15.332
- and I will, I promise... that
I'd be admitted here officially.

33:17.736 --> 33:21.797
I just wanted to introduce myself and
say I look forward to practice.

33:22.641 --> 33:24.802
- Thank you.
- So long.

33:27.212 --> 33:28.406
Sorry.

33:30.815 --> 33:34.581
For us, divine inspiration does not
mean that God possesses a man...

33:34.786 --> 33:38.051
...and simply dictates
the inspired text to him.

33:38.256 --> 33:39.086
Rather...

33:39.524 --> 33:43.756
...that God implants into a man's mind
the general concept.

33:43.962 --> 33:45.224
When God does that...

33:45.430 --> 33:49.059
...He allows the man to write that
in his historical context.

33:49.267 --> 33:52.896
The sitz im leben, or,
"That is the setting in life."

33:53.104 --> 33:56.437
So a man may have
historical inaccuracies...

33:56.641 --> 33:59.667
...but God allows
those misunderstandings...

33:59.878 --> 34:02.403
...because what is important
and inherent...

34:02.614 --> 34:05.947
...is the theological concept that
God is getting across to mankind.

34:06.151 --> 34:08.244
I think that's all for today.

34:08.453 --> 34:12.355
We will have a quiz on Monday,
so please prepare yourselves for it.

34:13.725 --> 34:15.283
Well done, Father.

34:15.594 --> 34:17.186
Please grade these for me.

34:17.395 --> 34:19.522
- Appreciate it. Thank you.
- Certainly.

34:22.900 --> 34:24.926
You learning stenography or what?

34:26.036 --> 34:28.005
Everything he's mouthing
is in the book.

34:28.672 --> 34:30.641
I gotta make an A in this class.

34:30.842 --> 34:34.641
Just remember your sitz im leben,
and it shouldn't be a problem.

34:40.018 --> 34:43.215
I'm not talking to you, man.
Not after what you did.

34:44.054 --> 34:46.181
You brought a girl to meet me...

34:46.391 --> 34:49.417
...and the next thing you know,
she sits next to Brian...

34:49.628 --> 34:51.562
Hi, could you hold this?

34:51.763 --> 34:53.128
- Yeah, sure.
- Thanks.

34:53.465 --> 34:55.659
So you're interested
in a room to rent?

34:56.534 --> 34:57.831
I don't know. Maybe.

34:58.036 --> 35:00.903
My brother has a house about
five blocks from campus.

35:01.106 --> 35:03.131
I'm sick and tired of...

35:03.642 --> 35:06.304
- I have an extra card I can give you.
- Just forget it.

35:06.945 --> 35:09.140
Forget it. See you.

35:10.215 --> 35:11.944
So if you're interested,
call soon.

35:12.150 --> 35:14.675
Maybe tonight. All right, bye.

35:19.357 --> 35:21.587
You don't have a goddamn clue, do you?

35:23.528 --> 35:24.392
About what?

35:24.596 --> 35:26.757
About how to get an A in that class.

35:27.399 --> 35:28.889
I could help you.

35:29.834 --> 35:33.065
Look, besides being an honor student
at Notre Dame...

35:33.271 --> 35:35.569
...and a TA in Father...

35:37.642 --> 35:40.770
I'm also a tutor for hire.

35:40.979 --> 35:43.539
I can't even afford a room to rent.

35:44.783 --> 35:47.718
Wait, maybe we can make
some other kind of deal.

35:48.653 --> 35:50.245
What kind of deal?

35:50.622 --> 35:51.714
Well...

35:56.094 --> 35:59.154
...I got Notre Dame pretty well
staked out.

35:59.698 --> 36:00.926
Staked out?

36:01.332 --> 36:02.162
Girls.

36:02.367 --> 36:04.096
- I don't know here...
- Excuse me.

36:04.302 --> 36:06.133
- Sorry.
- Sorry.

36:07.405 --> 36:09.703
I don't know the girls
here at Holy Cross.

36:09.908 --> 36:12.502
- What's your point?
- Well, maybe you could...

36:12.711 --> 36:13.541
What?

36:13.745 --> 36:17.010
- Introduce me to a few...
- I don't know any girls here.

36:19.017 --> 36:20.245
So be it.

36:25.056 --> 36:26.216
Wait a minute.

36:26.424 --> 36:27.721
Hey, wait!

36:28.793 --> 36:30.260
Hey, wait a minute.

36:30.829 --> 36:32.319
Maybe I do know some girls.

36:32.530 --> 36:34.725
In fact, I know a lot of girls.

36:34.933 --> 36:37.766
- I just gotta find them.
- That's the spirit.

36:37.969 --> 36:40.563
As you can see, I'm pretty
goddamn desperate.

36:40.772 --> 36:41.830
I'm D-Bob.

36:42.040 --> 36:44.031
- Rudy.
- And I'm in love.

36:44.242 --> 36:46.802
- Hey, how you doing?
- Don't say anything.

36:47.011 --> 36:49.844
Pretty sweater you're wearing.
This is D-Bob.

36:50.048 --> 36:51.879
He's feeling not well.

36:52.083 --> 36:53.641
Will you cut it out?

36:54.986 --> 36:56.283
Branski twisted his knee.

36:56.488 --> 36:58.012
He's not gonna make...

36:58.223 --> 37:01.192
- Is this the practice field?
- All practices are closed.

37:01.392 --> 37:02.916
- I know Coach Parseghian.
- Are you...

37:03.128 --> 37:05.460
- I talked to him the other day.
- Watch out.

37:08.666 --> 37:10.258
- Step back, okay?
- All right.

37:15.206 --> 37:16.366
Hey, coach!

37:19.944 --> 37:23.004
You gotta keep your eyes open
around here, kid.

37:24.983 --> 37:26.780
Hey, coach!

37:27.118 --> 37:28.449
Coach Parseghian...

37:28.987 --> 37:32.150
...anything I can do to help the team,
you just let me know.

37:34.292 --> 37:35.725
See you.

37:45.904 --> 37:47.428
- Who's that?
- Your lunch breaks are too long.

37:48.640 --> 37:49.971
Go plug in the end zone.

37:50.175 --> 37:52.700
- Tell Jake I need to talk to him.
- All right, boss.

37:53.778 --> 37:58.408
- What did I tell you about trespassing?
- You're the guy I need to talk to.

37:59.050 --> 38:01.712
- I need your help.
- Why should I help you?

38:02.020 --> 38:05.717
- I want to be your assistant.
- I've got a full crew.

38:05.924 --> 38:08.825
Couldn't you use somebody else?
I mean, I'll work for free.

38:09.661 --> 38:11.288
What's in it for you?

38:11.629 --> 38:14.860
I volunteered to help the team
do anything I can, but...

38:15.066 --> 38:17.432
...I can't, because I'm not
a student here.

38:17.635 --> 38:19.125
But I will be.

38:19.404 --> 38:23.033
I figured if I'm gonna play here,
I need to know the lay of the land.

38:23.608 --> 38:24.973
You're nuts.

38:25.176 --> 38:26.803
I've heard that a lot.

38:27.011 --> 38:29.741
Well, you've got to be nuts
to want to work for nothing.

38:33.051 --> 38:35.611
I just want to be a part
of this university.

38:41.960 --> 38:43.427
Okay.

38:44.095 --> 38:46.825
Meet me here tomorrow, 10 a.m.

38:47.165 --> 38:49.759
- Thanks.
- Minimum wage.

38:52.170 --> 38:54.104
- Thanks again.
- All right.

38:55.106 --> 38:57.472
Did you understand what
I was trying to say?

38:57.675 --> 38:58.733
You don't understand.

38:58.943 --> 39:01.138
- Let me give you a hand.
- Are you sure?

39:01.346 --> 39:03.644
- No problem. Here.
- I got it.

39:03.848 --> 39:05.748
- Keep it straight, kid.
- Okay.

39:06.784 --> 39:09.412
- Poet. Scholar.
- Dickinson. Dickinson.

39:10.255 --> 39:12.416
Hut, hut. Blue and gold, let's go.

39:13.157 --> 39:15.284
- Hi there, what's your name?
- Donna.

39:15.493 --> 39:18.929
- Great. My name's Rudy Ruettiger.
- Hi, I'm Colleen.

39:20.431 --> 39:23.730
- I've got this buddy, D-Bob.
- D-Bob with the two watches?

39:23.935 --> 39:25.596
Mr. Marshall Fields?

39:25.803 --> 39:29.762
- His name's D-Bob. He's a sweetheart.
- Well, maybe I'll see you around.

39:29.974 --> 39:32.966
- No, I have class.
- I sit behind you in 235.

39:36.214 --> 39:38.739
- Two watches!
- Two watches!

39:40.985 --> 39:45.479
Don't waste time reading the question
if it's a long test in a short period.

39:45.690 --> 39:47.715
- All right.
- Two of them will be similar.

39:47.926 --> 39:51.054
It'll be one of those two.
One's absurd. Forget that one.

39:51.262 --> 39:52.923
- This is important.
- "Increase...

39:53.164 --> 39:55.758
...in psychological responses."
- What do you think?

39:55.967 --> 39:57.264
Excuse me.

39:57.468 --> 40:00.528
I'm sorry to interrupt, but
I just have to ask you...

40:00.738 --> 40:03.002
...have we met somewhere before?

40:03.274 --> 40:06.300
You know, you look
really familiar to me.

40:08.713 --> 40:12.444
Maybe psych class. Do you have psych
on Monday, Wednesday, Friday?

40:12.650 --> 40:14.618
I'm in there at 10:00.

40:16.487 --> 40:17.954
Yeah, he's in that class.

40:18.156 --> 40:20.818
I bet that's where.
I knew you looked familiar.

40:21.025 --> 40:24.358
Well, anyway, this is kind of
embarrassing, but...

40:24.562 --> 40:27.292
...you heard about the dance
on Saturday night, right?

40:30.501 --> 40:32.298
- Right?
- Yeah, we've heard about it.

40:32.503 --> 40:37.406
Okay. All right, well, I was just
wondering, do you have any plans?

40:41.279 --> 40:46.080
- That's great. So you're available?
- D-Bob would love to go.

40:46.317 --> 40:48.046
Really? This is so great.

40:48.252 --> 40:51.517
I would love to introduce you
to my roommate, Elza.

40:53.858 --> 40:55.553
Elza, come here.

41:04.702 --> 41:09.196
D-Bob was suspicious, so he made me go
to a language lab to take these tests.

41:09.407 --> 41:12.342
They said I had a slight case
of dyslexia.

41:12.543 --> 41:15.876
It's when the words get mixed up
in your head when you're reading.

41:17.048 --> 41:21.178
I'm doing exercises to help me, and...

41:21.386 --> 41:24.753
...I got an A on a literature test.
- That's great, kid.

41:26.391 --> 41:28.086
Hey, do you live in here?

41:29.060 --> 41:31.187
Believe it or not, got my own home.

41:31.396 --> 41:33.557
That cot's for when
my sciatica acts up.

41:33.898 --> 41:35.729
Okay, let's go to work.

41:37.168 --> 41:39.227
See that hose on top of the locker?

41:39.437 --> 41:40.802
Bring that with you.

41:59.090 --> 42:00.182
So you're in student housing?

42:00.825 --> 42:02.986
Huh?

42:03.194 --> 42:05.287
No, I'm living with a friend in town.

42:05.496 --> 42:06.929
Where in town?

42:08.332 --> 42:12.359
- I haven't found a place to stay yet.
- Funds pretty low, huh?

42:13.571 --> 42:16.631
All my savings went for tuition.

42:16.841 --> 42:19.036
I shower at Holy Cross.
I'm all right.

42:19.243 --> 42:23.873
- So this is it, huh?
- This is where it starts and finishes.

42:54.278 --> 42:55.973
"I've gotta go, Rock.

42:56.280 --> 42:58.339
It's all right. I'm not afraid.

42:59.016 --> 43:01.041
Sometime, when the team's
in trouble...

43:01.252 --> 43:04.744
...and things are wrong and the breaks
are beating the boys...

43:04.956 --> 43:08.756
...tell them to go in there and
win just one for the Gipper.

43:10.194 --> 43:14.722
I don't know where I'll be then, Rock,
but I'll know about it...

43:14.932 --> 43:16.627
...and I'll be happy."

43:24.876 --> 43:26.241
The Four Horsemen.

43:27.378 --> 43:29.141
Knute Rockne.

43:30.615 --> 43:32.310
Moose Krause.

43:32.850 --> 43:34.215
Angelo Bertelli.

43:34.418 --> 43:36.113
Johnny Lujack.

43:36.320 --> 43:39.517
Leon Hart, Terry Hanratty, Jack Snow.

43:40.158 --> 43:41.682
John Lattner.

43:47.064 --> 43:49.624
Paul Hornung could've dressed
in this locker.

43:50.468 --> 43:52.333
We got work to do, kid.

44:04.115 --> 44:07.243
"We're gonna go inside.
We're gonna go outside.

44:07.451 --> 44:11.182
We're gonna get them on the run.
We're gonna keep them on the run.

44:11.389 --> 44:13.050
Then we're gonna go, go, go, go, go!

44:13.257 --> 44:15.623
We won't stop until we're across
that goal line.

44:16.093 --> 44:20.962
This is a team they say is good.
Well, I think we're better than them.

44:21.332 --> 44:22.799
They can't lick us.

44:24.135 --> 44:25.659
What do you say, men?"

45:01.872 --> 45:04.102
By the way, Gipper,
I got your gym card.

45:04.308 --> 45:06.003
- Great!
- Wait, we had a deal.

45:06.210 --> 45:09.771
- I do your laundry for two months.
- This was hard to get.

45:09.981 --> 45:13.007
- It's gonna be a semester.
- Of doing your laundry?

45:13.584 --> 45:15.415
- Come on, let me see.
- A semester.

45:15.620 --> 45:17.850
All right, fine.
Just let me see the card.

45:20.625 --> 45:23.992
- Come on, that's impossible.
- It's your job to give it a shot.

45:24.195 --> 45:26.322
She's out of our league.

45:26.530 --> 45:28.327
Tell her I'm a Fields.

45:28.799 --> 45:32.735
As in Marshall Fields. She'll know.
Just tell her that, please.

45:41.479 --> 45:44.539
That looks great.
I think you'll really enjoy it.

45:45.349 --> 45:48.341
Hi, are you interested in joining
a student activity?

45:49.620 --> 45:51.178
Here's your choices.

45:55.259 --> 45:58.786
Do you see that guy over there?
Over by the pillar.

45:58.996 --> 46:02.659
Could you wave at him a little bit?
Just kind of humor him.

46:03.534 --> 46:04.728
Please?

46:11.309 --> 46:13.140
That was perfect. Thank you.

46:13.344 --> 46:14.311
Well?

46:14.745 --> 46:17.976
Choir looks good. I used to sing
in the high school choir.

46:18.182 --> 46:21.913
- What's Football Boosters?
- We organize the pep rallies and...

46:22.119 --> 46:25.020
...paint the helmets
the night before the game.

46:25.222 --> 46:27.622
The actual football helmets?
You guys...

46:27.825 --> 46:29.952
That's definitely me.
Where do I sign?

46:30.161 --> 46:31.389
Right here.

46:33.364 --> 46:35.423
You are a student
at Notre Dame, right?

46:37.401 --> 46:39.596
Yeah. Why, don't I look like one?

46:39.804 --> 46:41.704
Oh, no, we're just supposed to ask.

46:41.906 --> 46:45.239
Yeah, I'm Notre Dame gold and blue,
through and through.

46:45.676 --> 46:50.079
The first meeting is tomorrow night
at the ACC, 7:00.

46:50.314 --> 46:52.305
- See you there.
- All right, bye.

46:53.551 --> 46:55.951
Like to sign up
for a student activity?

46:56.153 --> 46:57.814
- Strike?
- Out.

46:58.222 --> 47:01.020
She has a boyfriend
who's on the football team.

47:01.225 --> 47:04.558
- You looked like you were in.
- Well, I'm sorry.

47:04.762 --> 47:07.959
You look awful goddamn
happy about this.

47:09.500 --> 47:10.899
Thank you.

47:12.937 --> 47:16.600
- Did you get the field passes?
- Chuck hasn't given them to me yet.

47:17.208 --> 47:18.334
Mary.

47:21.011 --> 47:22.035
Mary!

47:28.886 --> 47:31.081
- Watch yourself.
- Oh! Sorry.

47:41.699 --> 47:42.757
Hey...

47:43.567 --> 47:45.159
...isn't this fantastic?

47:45.369 --> 47:47.633
There's 24-karat gold in the paint!

47:47.838 --> 47:51.069
- What's your name again?
- Rudy Ruettiger.

47:51.642 --> 47:55.100
I need your student I.D.
To get your card section pass.

47:56.881 --> 47:59.008
I don't have it now,
but I'm gonna get it.

47:59.216 --> 48:03.209
- I'll have it by tomorrow.
- I gotta send the names in tonight.

48:03.421 --> 48:05.355
Couldn't you let it slide this once?

48:05.556 --> 48:08.491
It's the rules, sorry. Next game.

48:10.728 --> 48:14.129
Are you gonna come to Corby's?
It's where we all go afterwards.

48:14.331 --> 48:16.492
Yeah, I'll be there. Thanks.

48:31.282 --> 48:35.651
Is that Bob Gladieux and Ron Dushney
sitting at the end of the bar?

48:36.353 --> 48:38.821
- How about another one?
- Sure.

48:39.457 --> 48:42.688
Now, that's a game to remember:
1966 against Michigan State.

48:42.893 --> 48:47.159
Gladieux caught the greatest pass
in Notre Dame football history.

48:48.199 --> 48:49.029
Hey!

48:49.233 --> 48:52.964
"Mary, Mary quite contrary,
what makes your garden grow?"

48:54.538 --> 48:57.598
Excuse me, could I get change
for a dollar, please?

48:57.808 --> 48:59.139
Thank you.

48:59.810 --> 49:00.640
You all right?

49:01.679 --> 49:05.877
Yeah. I just wanted to say
it's been a pleasure working with you.

49:06.717 --> 49:07.547
Thanks.

49:07.751 --> 49:12.154
You said before you were the greatest
Notre Dame football fan in history.

49:12.356 --> 49:16.053
I thought I was, so I guess that
means we got something in common.

49:18.629 --> 49:22.622
In fact, I'm gonna be playing football
for the Irish next fall.

49:22.833 --> 49:25.199
I've talked to Coach Parseghian
about it.

49:25.402 --> 49:28.894
You see, I'm at Holy Cross for
a semester, maybe two at the most.

49:29.106 --> 49:31.438
Father Cavanaugh says
if I make the grades...

49:31.876 --> 49:34.436
...I'll have a real good shot
at getting in.

49:34.712 --> 49:38.273
And for the first time in my life,
my grades have been really good.

49:39.083 --> 49:41.108
You're not a Notre Dame student?

49:43.187 --> 49:44.051
Not officially.

49:44.255 --> 49:47.713
- But I will be next semester.
- You can't be a part of the Boosters.

49:47.925 --> 49:50.758
- I'm sorry.
- Mary, wait a minute.

49:51.228 --> 49:53.059
Will you please forget I said that?

49:53.264 --> 49:56.199
- You know what a tremendous fan I am.
- It's the rules.

49:56.400 --> 49:57.833
I know, but...

49:59.670 --> 50:00.967
Damn!

50:33.804 --> 50:34.828
I need one ticket.

50:35.039 --> 50:37.064
No way.

50:37.274 --> 50:41.176
- Mister, I got 10 bucks for a ticket.
- Ten bucks? You're 90 short.

50:42.079 --> 50:45.845
- Kid, can I buy that ticket from you?
- Yeah, for 20 bucks.

50:47.251 --> 50:51.950
- Please, can I get in? I got $10.
- I couldn't do it. I'd lose my job.

50:52.156 --> 50:53.350
Really.

50:53.624 --> 50:55.285
I'd like to, buddy.

50:57.795 --> 51:01.925
- Hands off to Eric Penick
for the Notre Dame touchdown.

51:10.341 --> 51:12.366
Do you have an extra ticket? Please?

51:12.576 --> 51:15.409
- One ticket. I just need one seat.
- I'm sorry, no.

51:32.630 --> 51:37.567
Point after attempt is good. Score:
Irish, 7, Northwestern, nothing.

53:02.686 --> 53:05.985
Fortune, did you see Eric Penick's
kickoff return yesterday?

53:06.724 --> 53:08.248
I saw it on TV.

53:08.459 --> 53:10.586
He broke free right about here.

53:11.061 --> 53:14.428
The 40. The 35. The 30!

53:14.631 --> 53:17.225
The 25! The 20! The 15!

53:17.434 --> 53:20.631
The 10! The 5! Touchdown Irish!

53:25.876 --> 53:28.071
Hey, hey, hey, we got work to do.

53:29.213 --> 53:31.443
Down, set, hut!

53:36.553 --> 53:39.613
- You ever see a game from in here?
- Nope.

53:40.457 --> 53:44.291
Well, then your first game
will be one I'm playing in.

53:44.495 --> 53:48.591
Whatever you say, kid.
You gonna watch me or help me?

53:53.137 --> 53:55.435
Thanks for the blanket and the key.

53:55.639 --> 53:57.607
I don't know nothing about it.

53:58.041 --> 54:00.202
Then who put the key on the cot?

54:02.045 --> 54:03.979
You hear what I just said?

54:05.449 --> 54:06.381
Yeah.

54:21.298 --> 54:23.323
All B's.

54:24.501 --> 54:25.991
And an A.

54:28.172 --> 54:30.732
I know my grades have gone down,
Father, but...

54:30.941 --> 54:33.466
...I have a lot of
extracurricular activities.

54:33.911 --> 54:36.004
You did a good job, kid.

54:36.547 --> 54:41.484
Admissions people, you never can tell.
They're a funny bunch of squirrels.

54:42.085 --> 54:43.985
Have I done all I can?

55:06.310 --> 55:07.436
Excuse me.

55:07.644 --> 55:10.010
Hi, I need box 620, please.

55:15.452 --> 55:16.714
Thank you.

55:27.965 --> 55:30.957
"Dear Mr. Ruettiger,
Your application for admission...

55:31.168 --> 55:34.399
...to the University of Notre Dame
has been evaluated by..."

55:46.984 --> 55:49.646
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

55:59.830 --> 56:03.857
Tommy, where did you get that?
Oh, you're all sticky.

56:04.067 --> 56:08.197
It's okay, but it's just gonna
get everything all over the place.

56:09.706 --> 56:10.695
Rudy!

56:11.742 --> 56:13.573
Where have you been for so long?

56:13.777 --> 56:17.474
I've been going to college
at Holy Cross. It's in South Bend.

56:17.714 --> 56:21.343
If you're going to Holy Cross,
why do you have a Notre Dame jacket?

56:21.551 --> 56:24.349
- I'll go there next year.
- Then that's where I'll go too!

56:24.554 --> 56:27.022
Do you want something to eat?

56:32.529 --> 56:34.429
An A and three B's.

56:37.067 --> 56:38.500
Good for you.

56:42.839 --> 56:46.536
I didn't make it into Notre Dame this
semester. I saw a few home games.

56:46.977 --> 56:50.879
I thought about you. You'd have loved
it. You gotta come over for a game.

56:51.148 --> 56:52.740
It's so exciting. You've...

56:52.950 --> 56:56.408
I watch the games here on
my television. That's fine for me.

56:56.620 --> 56:58.747
I know, but it's not the same thing.

57:02.559 --> 57:03.958
What if I were in the game?

57:04.161 --> 57:06.527
Jesus, we still have
to listen to this crap?

57:06.730 --> 57:08.994
That semester at college
didn't make you smarter.

57:09.333 --> 57:11.699
I'm glad you made good grades.

57:13.503 --> 57:15.164
Come on, Johnny. Please tell me.

57:15.605 --> 57:17.368
It wouldn't be a surprise if I tell.

57:17.574 --> 57:19.633
You can do better than that.

57:19.843 --> 57:21.674
Okay, one more hint.

57:23.313 --> 57:27.374
Hey, Johnny-boy, aren't you gonna
wish your brother a merry Christmas?

57:43.033 --> 57:44.364
How you doing, Rudy?

57:46.203 --> 57:47.192
Fine.

57:48.672 --> 57:53.405
I just want to tell you that
you going to college and all...

57:54.344 --> 57:55.902
...I think that's great.

57:57.080 --> 57:58.604
Thanks, Johnny.

58:03.153 --> 58:04.848
I'll be in the kitchen.

58:10.794 --> 58:12.022
I gotta go.

58:13.830 --> 58:15.661
Why don't you stay for a while?

58:15.866 --> 58:17.299
I have to go to work.

58:17.501 --> 58:18.968
Rudy, I'm sorry.

58:19.536 --> 58:23.028
I just want to tell you that
I hope you make it. I do.

58:58.508 --> 58:59.475
Hi.

59:00.177 --> 59:01.166
Hi.

59:10.187 --> 59:12.712
Twelve o'clock. Closing time.

59:12.923 --> 59:15.221
- Thanks, Mrs. Mackenzie.
- You're welcome.

59:21.398 --> 59:22.387
Thanks.

59:44.287 --> 59:47.723
Vacation, that's all I hear from you.
"I'm gonna go on vacation."

59:48.091 --> 59:50.525
After this game you're gonna
pay my money, right?

59:50.727 --> 59:52.661
What about the end of the month?

59:55.632 --> 59:57.429
Total failure.

59:57.634 --> 59:59.101
Everything I did.

59:59.302 --> 01:00:03.363
Work, the studying, four hours
a night's sleep in a dungeon.

01:00:08.378 --> 01:00:10.778
I've blown another year
of eligibility.

01:00:10.981 --> 01:00:12.778
This entire year's been a waste.

01:00:12.983 --> 01:00:14.041
A waste, huh?

01:00:15.485 --> 01:00:19.148
You got your head so far up your ass
about that damn football team...

01:00:19.356 --> 01:00:23.258
...you don't get that you just got
one year of top-quality education.

01:00:23.460 --> 01:00:24.791
"Waste."

01:00:25.495 --> 01:00:27.588
Don't be wasting my time.

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.634
Ain't you got some work to do?

01:00:49.085 --> 01:00:52.521
First three chapters for next week.
Start thinking about those.

01:00:58.628 --> 01:00:59.686
Thank you.

01:01:22.652 --> 01:01:23.812
Damn it!

01:02:00.390 --> 01:02:01.424
We gotta do
our own cooking and laundry.

01:02:01.424 --> 01:02:02.857
We gotta do
our own cooking and laundry.

01:02:03.059 --> 01:02:05.084
I'm not very good at that either.

01:02:05.295 --> 01:02:07.855
You gonna invite me?

01:02:08.064 --> 01:02:09.463
You'll be the first one.

01:02:09.666 --> 01:02:13.693
- First? I'm gonna be the guinea pig?
- If you live through it, why...

01:02:13.903 --> 01:02:16.269
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

01:02:24.714 --> 01:02:27.342
Taking your appeal to a higher court.

01:02:27.751 --> 01:02:29.082
I'm desperate.

01:02:29.653 --> 01:02:32.622
If I don't get in next semester,
it's over, done.

01:02:33.023 --> 01:02:35.617
Notre Dame doesn't accept
senior transfers.

01:02:39.062 --> 01:02:42.896
Well, you did a hell of a job, kid,
chasing down your dream.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.764
I don't care. If it doesn't produce
results, it doesn't mean anything.

01:02:49.406 --> 01:02:51.931
I think you'll discover that it will.

01:02:54.277 --> 01:02:56.643
Maybe I haven't prayed enough.

01:02:56.846 --> 01:02:58.711
I'm sure that's not the problem.

01:02:59.816 --> 01:03:02.046
Praying is something
we do in our time.

01:03:02.252 --> 01:03:04.550
The answers come in God's time.

01:03:05.855 --> 01:03:10.417
Have I done everything I possibly can?
Can you help me?

01:03:14.531 --> 01:03:17.659
Son, in 35 years
of religious studies...

01:03:17.867 --> 01:03:21.633
...I've come up with only
two hard, incontrovertible facts:

01:03:21.838 --> 01:03:23.203
There is a God...

01:03:25.375 --> 01:03:26.899
...and I'm not Him.

01:03:48.698 --> 01:03:51.326
Is there anything in box 620, please?

01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:33.404
"...has been approved.

01:04:35.478 --> 01:04:39.073
You've been accepted as a freshman
for the fall semester..."

01:04:51.661 --> 01:04:53.424
Oh, thank God.

01:05:12.282 --> 01:05:13.544
What's wrong?

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:14.910
Read it.

01:05:22.926 --> 01:05:26.623
"Congratulations, you are..."

01:05:32.769 --> 01:05:33.827
I did it.

01:05:36.906 --> 01:05:38.100
You did it.

01:05:38.842 --> 01:05:40.139
You did it.

01:05:41.811 --> 01:05:43.039
Hey, guys.

01:05:44.147 --> 01:05:45.739
My son's going to Notre Dame.

01:05:45.949 --> 01:05:47.940
All right, Rudy. Way to go!

01:05:49.986 --> 01:05:51.681
Hey, you guys!

01:05:52.489 --> 01:05:55.083
My son's going to Notre Dame!

01:05:57.293 --> 01:06:00.694
You hear that, Johnny?
Your brother's going to Notre Dame.

01:06:00.897 --> 01:06:02.558
Can you believe it, Frank?

01:06:03.066 --> 01:06:04.397
Congratulations.

01:06:04.801 --> 01:06:08.703
So, listen, you wanna work
till it's time to go to school?

01:06:08.905 --> 01:06:12.500
I gotta get back, Pop.
Football tryouts start this week.

01:06:20.416 --> 01:06:21.747
I'll call you.

01:06:39.569 --> 01:06:42.231
One, two, three...

01:06:43.039 --> 01:06:46.566
...four, five, six...

01:06:46.776 --> 01:06:48.767
...seven, eight!

01:07:02.992 --> 01:07:05.085
Let me tell it to you
as clean as I can.

01:07:06.563 --> 01:07:07.962
We have 95 players here...

01:07:08.398 --> 01:07:11.060
...so accomplished
as athletes in high school...

01:07:11.267 --> 01:07:15.601
...they have full scholarships to the
best football program in the country.

01:07:15.805 --> 01:07:20.105
NCAA regulations allow us
to dress just 60 for home games...

01:07:20.310 --> 01:07:23.302
...which means at least
35 scholarship players...

01:07:23.513 --> 01:07:25.811
...will be watching the game
from the stands.

01:07:26.015 --> 01:07:28.483
So if any of you has any fantasies...

01:07:28.685 --> 01:07:32.712
...about running out of that tunnel
with your helmet shining in the sun...

01:07:32.922 --> 01:07:34.787
...you best leave them right here.

01:07:34.991 --> 01:07:39.223
Of you 15 dreamers out there,
maybe we'll keep one or two.

01:07:40.063 --> 01:07:44.762
My job is to basically beat the shit
out of you for the next five days.

01:07:44.968 --> 01:07:47.300
And whoever is still
standing at the end...

01:07:47.503 --> 01:07:49.971
...maybe we'll use
for our scout teams.

01:07:50.173 --> 01:07:54.007
You'll be running the opposition's plays
week in and week out.

01:07:54.477 --> 01:07:58.106
Your greatest value to us is,
we don't care whether you get hurt.

01:07:58.314 --> 01:08:02.751
Our first teams are gonna pound on you
like you're their worst enemies.

01:08:03.886 --> 01:08:06.013
Like what you hear so far?

01:08:07.256 --> 01:08:11.158
Any of you want to run home to Mama?
Now's your chance.

01:08:12.795 --> 01:08:15.093
Joe, they're all yours.

01:08:15.298 --> 01:08:19.166
Don't just stand there trying to think.
Let's hit those ropes. Move it!

01:08:19.368 --> 01:08:21.394
Move it, I said! Come on!

01:08:22.839 --> 01:08:24.466
Pick them up, pick them up!

01:08:24.674 --> 01:08:27.404
High knees!
Let's go, gentlemen, let's go!

01:08:27.609 --> 01:08:29.874
Pump your arms,
keep your heads up.

01:08:30.145 --> 01:08:32.273
That's it, don't step on that rope!

01:08:32.482 --> 01:08:36.680
Up and down, let's go!
We want to see how quick you are here.

01:08:36.886 --> 01:08:38.513
Keep it rolling, keep it rolling.

01:08:40.590 --> 01:08:42.615
Heads up, keep moving, keep moving.

01:08:42.825 --> 01:08:45.919
Pump those arms, pump those arms
when you're backwards running.

01:08:46.129 --> 01:08:48.393
Move it, move it, move it!

01:08:48.598 --> 01:08:50.497
Keep your heads up,
keep your heads up!

01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:51.724
Run!

01:09:10.086 --> 01:09:12.054
Get in there, Ruettiger,
get in there!

01:09:19.395 --> 01:09:21.955
All right, let's concentrate
and get it right.

01:09:23.899 --> 01:09:26.198
Go hard, charge him.

01:09:38.281 --> 01:09:41.250
What is that?
What are you doing? Come on!

01:09:41.451 --> 01:09:43.578
Who has the play?
Who wants to do it right?

01:09:44.187 --> 01:09:45.279
I got it.

01:09:45.822 --> 01:09:47.756
All right, stay low.

01:09:56.132 --> 01:09:58.191
Come on, let's do it again!

01:09:59.535 --> 01:10:02.003
- Get out of here.
- Coach, I can do it.

01:10:02.438 --> 01:10:04.838
Oh, yeah? All right, we'll see.

01:10:18.621 --> 01:10:20.987
This is where we separate
the men from the girls.

01:10:21.190 --> 01:10:22.953
30, hit the spot.

01:10:36.939 --> 01:10:40.306
Get in there. Now pick him off.
Pick him off, damn it!

01:10:44.714 --> 01:10:47.046
All right, if you want
to make this team...

01:10:51.954 --> 01:10:54.149
Relax for a few minutes.

01:10:58.761 --> 01:11:01.059
If it was up to me,
I'd get rid of all of them.

01:11:01.464 --> 01:11:04.058
If they can't protect themselves,
I don't want them.

01:11:04.267 --> 01:11:05.529
The kid with blood on him.

01:11:05.735 --> 01:11:07.100
Ruettiger?

01:11:07.303 --> 01:11:09.794
Have you been watching?
No athletic skill.

01:11:10.006 --> 01:11:14.033
- He's put more effort than anybody.
- You fellows decide.

01:11:14.243 --> 01:11:17.804
Not in my defensive backfield.
You want him, you got him.

01:11:18.781 --> 01:11:22.148
All right, shower up.
We'll let you know.

01:11:24.353 --> 01:11:25.877
You think you made it?

01:11:26.923 --> 01:11:28.618
Unfortunately, yeah.

01:11:29.358 --> 01:11:31.883
What is so unfortunate
about making the team?

01:11:32.094 --> 01:11:34.085
This is my third year as a walk-on.

01:11:34.297 --> 01:11:37.266
I had scholarships
to two Big Ten schools.

01:11:37.466 --> 01:11:39.900
But my father was
an all-American here...

01:11:40.102 --> 01:11:42.195
...so I get a lot of family pressure.

01:11:42.405 --> 01:11:43.838
I don't understand.

01:11:44.040 --> 01:11:46.702
If you haven't been cut,
then you still have a chance.

01:11:46.909 --> 01:11:49.343
- What, a chance to play?
- Yeah.

01:11:49.545 --> 01:11:53.037
The only reason they keep me on
here is because I'm a legacy.

01:11:53.249 --> 01:11:56.047
To them I'm no more valuable
than a tackling dummy.

01:11:56.252 --> 01:11:57.947
Ruettiger, come with me.

01:11:58.154 --> 01:11:59.416
Yeah, coach.

01:12:00.823 --> 01:12:02.586
You want on the team pretty bad.

01:12:02.792 --> 01:12:04.259
You have no idea.

01:12:04.594 --> 01:12:07.791
- You sure busted your balls out there.
- Coach, I'll do anything.

01:12:07.997 --> 01:12:10.124
You think you can give
the same effort...

01:12:10.333 --> 01:12:13.302
...day in and day out
for the next five months?

01:12:13.502 --> 01:12:15.163
Sir, I have no doubt.

01:12:15.371 --> 01:12:19.137
Fine.
If you do lighten up one hair...

01:12:20.209 --> 01:12:23.770
...I'll throw you off this team
so fast you won't know what hit you.

01:12:25.481 --> 01:12:26.470
Wait a minute.

01:12:26.682 --> 01:12:29.617
Throw me off? That means
I gotta be on the team first.

01:12:29.819 --> 01:12:32.344
- Don't let me down.
- Does that mean I'm on the team?

01:12:32.555 --> 01:12:34.648
- Yeah, kid, you're on the team.
- Thank you!

01:12:34.857 --> 01:12:36.324
Hey, hey, come on.

01:12:36.525 --> 01:12:38.083
Go put some shoes on.

01:12:59.815 --> 01:13:01.544
Thanks for everything.

01:13:02.184 --> 01:13:03.116
Here.

01:13:03.319 --> 01:13:04.513
What's that?

01:13:05.254 --> 01:13:07.449
It's the key to the maintenance room.

01:13:08.791 --> 01:13:10.691
Don't know nothing about it.

01:13:16.799 --> 01:13:17.925
Yeah...

01:13:22.471 --> 01:13:26.168
You promised. You'll come see
your first game if I ever dress.

01:13:34.583 --> 01:13:38.451
Well, I'll stop by every now
and again, just to bother you.

01:13:39.789 --> 01:13:41.222
See you later.

01:13:42.191 --> 01:13:43.385
Hey, kid.

01:13:45.227 --> 01:13:46.888
You ever dress...

01:13:48.731 --> 01:13:49.993
...I'll be there.

01:13:54.603 --> 01:13:57.902
Rally, sons of Notre Dame

01:13:58.107 --> 01:14:01.235
Sing the glory and sound the fame

01:14:01.677 --> 01:14:04.908
Raise the gold and blue
And cheer with voices true

01:14:05.114 --> 01:14:07.173
Rah-rah for Notre Dame

01:14:08.684 --> 01:14:11.551
We will fight in every game

01:14:11.754 --> 01:14:15.485
Strong of heart and true to her name

01:14:15.691 --> 01:14:18.421
We will ne'er forget her
And will cheer her ever

01:14:18.627 --> 01:14:21.494
Loyal to Notre Dame

01:14:22.131 --> 01:14:25.430
Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame

01:14:25.634 --> 01:14:28.535
Wake up the echoes cheering her name

01:14:28.738 --> 01:14:31.502
Send the volley cheer on high

01:14:32.108 --> 01:14:35.100
Shake down the thunder from the sky

01:14:35.311 --> 01:14:38.337
What tho the odds be great or small

01:14:39.615 --> 01:14:41.913
Old Notre Dame will win over all

01:14:42.118 --> 01:14:45.178
While her loyal sons are marching

01:14:45.388 --> 01:14:47.856
Onward to victory

01:14:48.691 --> 01:14:51.819
Cheer, cheer for old Notre Dame

01:14:52.028 --> 01:14:55.293
Wake up the echoes cheering her name

01:14:55.498 --> 01:14:58.365
Send the volley cheer on high

01:14:58.567 --> 01:15:01.536
Shake down the thunder from the sky

01:15:01.737 --> 01:15:05.434
What tho the odds be great or small

01:15:05.641 --> 01:15:08.337
Old Notre Dame will win over all

01:15:08.544 --> 01:15:11.672
While her loyal sons are marching

01:15:11.881 --> 01:15:13.371
Onward to victory

01:15:15.418 --> 01:15:18.319
Onward to victory

01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:27.659
Sloppy!

01:15:28.330 --> 01:15:30.821
Run it again.
Sloppy, for chrissake!

01:15:31.033 --> 01:15:32.091
38 counter.

01:15:32.301 --> 01:15:35.759
The back missed the hole.
He's gotta go to the outside.

01:15:35.971 --> 01:15:38.166
You all right, man?
Come on, get up.

01:15:40.709 --> 01:15:42.336
- Get in the huddle.
- Ruettiger!

01:15:42.545 --> 01:15:44.069
Ruettiger, get out.

01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:45.804
I can do it, coach!

01:15:49.952 --> 01:15:51.476
- Ready?
- Let's go, fellas.

01:16:06.202 --> 01:16:07.533
What are you doing?

01:16:07.736 --> 01:16:11.797
Don't treat me like your kid brother.
I'm playing defense for Purdue.

01:16:14.009 --> 01:16:16.842
You ain't here to be no nanny
in no kindergarten!

01:16:17.046 --> 01:16:19.344
- Now, go play ball.
- Hit me, man.

01:16:32.261 --> 01:16:33.888
Red 40!

01:16:34.663 --> 01:16:36.153
Red 40!

01:16:46.108 --> 01:16:47.837
Keep your ass down.

01:16:55.484 --> 01:16:57.679
So on Eagle,
do I go on "set" or "2"?

01:16:57.887 --> 01:17:00.151
You gotta go on "set."
You gotta pick the man up.

01:17:00.356 --> 01:17:03.416
On Eagle Slant, do I let him slide
or do I pick him up too?

01:17:03.626 --> 01:17:05.958
Hey, little buddy! Hold up, man.

01:17:06.729 --> 01:17:09.163
I'm not talking to you.
You keep going.

01:17:10.032 --> 01:17:12.865
I'm sorry about
what happened at practice today.

01:17:13.068 --> 01:17:14.399
Don't be sorry.

01:17:14.970 --> 01:17:18.098
If you don't cool it out there,
you'll get yourself killed.

01:17:18.774 --> 01:17:23.177
If I cool it, I won't be helping you
get ready for the games. Got it?

01:17:26.081 --> 01:17:27.514
I got it.

01:17:28.150 --> 01:17:31.085
He's just a showboat, man.
That's all he's about.

01:17:31.287 --> 01:17:34.051
He's just doing his job, Jamie.
Can it.

01:17:38.794 --> 01:17:40.125
Go Irish!

01:17:41.030 --> 01:17:43.931
Go Irish!

01:18:17.433 --> 01:18:20.027
- Let's go. Come on.
- Come on, here we go.

01:18:33.315 --> 01:18:34.976
What are you doing, huh?

01:18:37.586 --> 01:18:38.610
Break it up!

01:18:38.821 --> 01:18:39.913
Get off me!

01:18:40.389 --> 01:18:41.686
Come on, Ruettiger!

01:18:43.559 --> 01:18:45.823
Break it up, I said. And cool down.

01:18:46.262 --> 01:18:48.924
You brown-nosed suck-ass!
You suck ass!

01:18:49.999 --> 01:18:52.160
What's your problem, O'Hare?

01:18:52.368 --> 01:18:55.633
Last practice and this asshole
thinks it's the Super Bowl.

01:18:55.971 --> 01:18:59.998
You just summed up
your entire sorry career here...

01:19:00.209 --> 01:19:01.836
...in one sentence!

01:19:02.044 --> 01:19:05.536
If you had a tenth of Ruettiger's heart,
you'd have made all-American.

01:19:05.748 --> 01:19:08.444
As it is, you just went
from third team to prep team.

01:19:08.651 --> 01:19:11.085
Go on, get out of here.
Get me another tailback.

01:19:11.287 --> 01:19:12.549
- Huddle!
- Let's run it.

01:19:12.755 --> 01:19:14.689
Come on, let's rock some ass.

01:19:15.391 --> 01:19:18.485
- Huddle!
- Let's go. Defense, come on out.

01:19:19.561 --> 01:19:22.860
Rudy, I want you to ice this
twice more in your room tonight.

01:19:23.065 --> 01:19:24.259
We'll see you tomorrow.

01:19:24.466 --> 01:19:27.697
Keep that pack on that shoulder
for at least 15 more minutes.

01:19:32.474 --> 01:19:33.498
Hey, Jim.

01:19:35.044 --> 01:19:38.707
Your bullshit out there makes us
look bad, so dial it down a notch.

01:19:39.181 --> 01:19:40.011
Dial it down?

01:19:40.215 --> 01:19:44.015
Everybody's sick and tired of hearing,
"Put out more like Ruettiger."

01:19:44.219 --> 01:19:46.813
What do you get out of
getting your head kicked in?

01:19:48.023 --> 01:19:49.513
It's not worth it, you know?

01:19:49.725 --> 01:19:52.353
You gotta be in at least one play
during a game...

01:19:52.561 --> 01:19:55.155
...to officially be part of this team.

01:19:55.564 --> 01:19:59.500
The only uniform you'll put on is
that grungy thing you've been wearing.

01:19:59.702 --> 01:20:02.364
If you hate it so much,
why don't you just quit?

01:20:03.906 --> 01:20:05.134
I can't.

01:20:05.841 --> 01:20:07.138
Why not?

01:20:09.511 --> 01:20:12.412
If I quit, my father
won't pay my tuition.

01:20:17.052 --> 01:20:18.542
Is that why you're here?

01:20:23.826 --> 01:20:28.195
I'm under the delusion that I might
get a chance to run out that tunnel.

01:20:41.610 --> 01:20:43.202
Does he think I'm lying to him?

01:20:43.412 --> 01:20:45.676
Nobody said nothing about lying.

01:20:45.881 --> 01:20:48.975
I have to get pictures taken
of practice to prove I'm on the team?

01:20:49.184 --> 01:20:50.344
I believe you.

01:20:50.552 --> 01:20:53.248
What happened to my face?
Where did I get these?

01:20:53.455 --> 01:20:57.084
- So you're a glorified waterboy.
- Oh, you just don't get it.

01:20:57.292 --> 01:21:01.058
If you are on that team, my opinion
of Notre Dame just hit the shits.

01:21:01.263 --> 01:21:02.321
Leave him alone.

01:21:02.531 --> 01:21:03.520
There's no "if."

01:21:03.732 --> 01:21:07.133
I wear a uniform, I block and tackle.
You just don't understand.

01:21:07.336 --> 01:21:08.462
Actually, it's simple.

01:21:08.670 --> 01:21:11.400
Every Saturday when we turn on
the TV to watch...

01:21:11.607 --> 01:21:15.771
...we see players wearing the blue
and gold. We just don't see you.

01:21:16.111 --> 01:21:17.271
You will.

01:21:17.479 --> 01:21:19.140
- What?
- You will. Now shoot.

01:21:19.381 --> 01:21:20.848
Just shoot.

01:21:27.022 --> 01:21:29.547
Coach, Rudy Ruettiger's
here to see you.

01:21:31.326 --> 01:21:32.759
Send him in.

01:21:41.870 --> 01:21:43.929
This won't take long, coach.

01:21:44.473 --> 01:21:48.409
First, I'd like to thank you for
the opportunity of being on the team.

01:21:48.610 --> 01:21:50.805
I never thought I'd be saying this...

01:21:51.013 --> 01:21:54.107
...but it's been a pleasure.
Now what can I do for you?

01:21:56.018 --> 01:21:59.852
Well, one of the many things
that I've learned this year...

01:22:00.055 --> 01:22:03.718
...is that no matter how hard I try,
I'll never get above the prep team.

01:22:03.926 --> 01:22:08.625
I've accepted that God made some
people football players, but not me.

01:22:09.064 --> 01:22:12.932
I wish God would put your heart
in some of my players' bodies.

01:22:17.039 --> 01:22:20.998
My father loves Notre Dame football
more than anything else in the world.

01:22:21.443 --> 01:22:23.536
He doesn't believe I'm on the team...

01:22:23.745 --> 01:22:26.077
...because he can't see me
during the games.

01:22:27.149 --> 01:22:30.983
Next year, my senior year, I'd love
to be able to give him this gift:

01:22:31.787 --> 01:22:35.314
I'd really appreciate it if you'd
let me dress one game next season.

01:22:37.593 --> 01:22:38.719
Look, Rudy...

01:22:38.927 --> 01:22:43.364
...the NCAA really hamstrings us
with this 60 rule.

01:22:43.565 --> 01:22:45.829
In some positions
we only have one backup.

01:22:46.034 --> 01:22:49.902
You know every year we're competing
for the national championship.

01:22:53.408 --> 01:22:55.376
Is this just for your father?

01:22:57.479 --> 01:23:01.848
No, it's for everybody who told me
that it would be impossible.

01:23:02.251 --> 01:23:03.843
It's for my brothers...

01:23:04.052 --> 01:23:07.419
...the kids in my high school,
the guys I work with at the mill.

01:23:08.257 --> 01:23:12.250
They can't come to practice
and see that I am part of the team.

01:23:16.999 --> 01:23:18.159
Okay.

01:23:21.203 --> 01:23:24.104
You deserve it. You'll dress
for one game next season.

01:23:26.775 --> 01:23:28.299
Thank you, coach.

01:23:31.880 --> 01:23:33.074
Yes!

01:23:33.882 --> 01:23:37.818
I don't know which game yet,
but it'll definitely be next season.

01:23:38.787 --> 01:23:40.311
I'm sure.

01:23:42.190 --> 01:23:45.250
I guess they'll tell me
a few days before the game.

01:23:45.460 --> 01:23:47.792
Look, just be ready, okay?

01:23:50.632 --> 01:23:51.963
Thanks, Dad.

01:23:53.068 --> 01:23:54.296
All right, bye.

01:23:55.971 --> 01:23:57.272
V-l-C-T-O-R-Y

01:23:57.272 --> 01:23:58.705
V-l-C-T-O-R-Y

01:23:58.907 --> 01:24:02.172
Victory, victory, that's our cry

01:24:03.278 --> 01:24:05.405
Gipper. Hey, Gipper!

01:24:06.548 --> 01:24:08.573
Goddamn Miami law school beckons.

01:24:09.685 --> 01:24:11.448
Miami!

01:24:11.920 --> 01:24:13.353
I had to go.

01:24:15.958 --> 01:24:17.482
What's wrong with you?

01:24:21.463 --> 01:24:22.487
Look.

01:24:25.100 --> 01:24:26.567
Ara quit?

01:24:28.036 --> 01:24:30.869
I'll be goddamned.
Who's the new coach?

01:24:31.073 --> 01:24:34.133
- Dan Devine from the Green Bay Packers.
- Wow...

01:24:34.943 --> 01:24:39.073
I'm sure Ara's gonna let him know
about his promise to let you dress.

01:24:40.182 --> 01:24:41.809
Come on, let's take a walk.

01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:45.948
When are you leaving?

01:24:46.188 --> 01:24:48.213
- In about six minutes.
- Really?

01:24:48.423 --> 01:24:51.153
The spring semester starts
in two weeks.

01:24:52.828 --> 01:24:55.456
We've had a hell of a goddamn...

01:24:55.664 --> 01:24:58.155
We've had a hell of a goddamn run,
haven't we?

01:24:58.367 --> 01:24:59.732
Yeah, we have.

01:25:00.602 --> 01:25:03.469
You let me know when you dress.
I'll fly out for that.

01:25:05.207 --> 01:25:07.971
There's no way I can thank you
for everything you've done.

01:25:10.646 --> 01:25:12.170
You already have.

01:25:14.583 --> 01:25:16.141
You remember Elza, right?

01:25:17.486 --> 01:25:19.044
- Hi.
- Good to see you again.

01:25:19.254 --> 01:25:21.916
She's my girl now.
She's coming with me.

01:25:22.124 --> 01:25:24.718
- Isn't that goddamn something?
- Dennis.

01:25:24.926 --> 01:25:29.022
I forgot. I'm not allowed
to say "goddamn" no more.

01:25:30.198 --> 01:25:32.598
What's a lapsed Catholic to do?

01:25:34.803 --> 01:25:37.033
- We should get going.
- Yeah.

01:25:37.339 --> 01:25:39.102
I'll see you next fall, right?

01:25:41.710 --> 01:25:43.405
Thanks for everything.

01:25:48.450 --> 01:25:50.509
- You take care of him.
- We're going.

01:26:59.154 --> 01:27:00.883
Don't I know you?

01:27:01.389 --> 01:27:03.721
Ruettiger, get your ass back out here!

01:27:46.768 --> 01:27:48.201
Touchdown!

01:28:42.924 --> 01:28:44.414
Sorry, man.

01:28:51.333 --> 01:28:52.595
Sorry, man.

01:28:56.004 --> 01:28:57.471
It just ain't right.

01:28:57.672 --> 01:28:59.196
No, it's not.

01:29:01.743 --> 01:29:03.370
- Where are you going?
- I quit.

01:29:03.578 --> 01:29:06.069
- Wait up.
- The hell with Devine, with Yonto!

01:29:06.281 --> 01:29:09.546
Wait up. In two years,
you haven't missed one practice.

01:29:09.751 --> 01:29:11.218
And now you just quit?

01:29:11.419 --> 01:29:14.013
- That's what I said.
- I don't want you to quit.

01:29:14.222 --> 01:29:16.247
What the hell is it to you?

01:29:17.292 --> 01:29:21.456
You're one of the reasons
I stayed on this last year.

01:29:22.864 --> 01:29:24.263
Well, I'm sorry.

01:29:24.466 --> 01:29:25.865
You're sorry?

01:29:26.067 --> 01:29:27.728
You're full of crap!

01:29:27.936 --> 01:29:31.269
Everything you did and
everything you said is bullshit!

01:29:33.608 --> 01:29:35.803
Tell Jake to make sure
the top's ready.

01:29:36.011 --> 01:29:40.573
We'll check with the weather service
by 5, and we'll make a decision then.

01:29:46.821 --> 01:29:48.584
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

01:29:48.957 --> 01:29:51.425
What you doing here?
Don't you have practice?

01:29:52.727 --> 01:29:54.786
Not anymore. I quit.

01:29:56.431 --> 01:29:59.093
Well, since when are you
the quitting kind?

01:30:01.036 --> 01:30:02.867
I don't see the point anymore.

01:30:03.371 --> 01:30:05.669
So you didn't make the dress list.

01:30:05.941 --> 01:30:08.171
There are greater tragedies
in the world.

01:30:08.376 --> 01:30:11.903
I wanted to run out of
that tunnel for my dad.

01:30:12.113 --> 01:30:13.102
To prove to everyone...

01:30:13.315 --> 01:30:14.612
Prove what?

01:30:16.618 --> 01:30:20.247
- That I was somebody.
- Oh, you are so full of crap.

01:30:21.456 --> 01:30:25.187
You're 5 feet nothing.
A hundred and nothing.

01:30:25.393 --> 01:30:27.884
And you've got hardly
a speck of athletic ability.

01:30:28.229 --> 01:30:32.791
You hung in with the best college
football team in the land for 2 years!

01:30:33.001 --> 01:30:37.665
And you're gonna walk out of here
with a degree from Notre Dame.

01:30:37.872 --> 01:30:42.332
In this life you don't have to prove
nothing to nobody except yourself.

01:30:42.544 --> 01:30:46.878
And after what you've gone through,
if you haven't done that by now...

01:30:47.082 --> 01:30:49.209
...it ain't gonna never happen.

01:30:53.388 --> 01:30:55.253
Now go on back.

01:30:58.626 --> 01:31:01.186
I'm sorry I never got you
to see your first game.

01:31:04.432 --> 01:31:07.629
Hell, I've seen too many games
in this stadium.

01:31:07.836 --> 01:31:11.431
- You said you never saw a game.
- I've never seen one from the stands.

01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:14.335
You were a player?

01:31:16.077 --> 01:31:19.012
I rode the bench for two years.

01:31:19.881 --> 01:31:22.281
Thought I wasn't being played
because of my color.

01:31:22.484 --> 01:31:26.420
I got filled up with
a lot of attitude, so I quit.

01:31:27.088 --> 01:31:29.750
Still not a week goes by,
I don't regret it.

01:31:29.958 --> 01:31:33.792
And I guarantee a week won't go by,
you won't regret walking out...

01:31:33.995 --> 01:31:36.293
...letting them get the best of you.

01:31:40.201 --> 01:31:42.533
Now, you hear me clear enough?

01:31:45.140 --> 01:31:46.266
Yeah.

01:32:14.969 --> 01:32:19.099
Bill? The pitch was too soon.
Wait. Make him commit.

01:32:19.808 --> 01:32:21.605
38 option, 38 option.

01:32:22.277 --> 01:32:23.608
Hustle up.

01:32:36.157 --> 01:32:37.351
It's Rudy.

01:33:08.123 --> 01:33:10.250
Welcome back. Line up.

01:33:11.793 --> 01:33:14.353
What's going on down there?
Get back to work.

01:33:24.739 --> 01:33:25.728
Yeah?

01:33:30.245 --> 01:33:32.338
Oh, hi, Roland. Come in.

01:33:36.317 --> 01:33:38.251
I want Rudy to dress in my place.

01:33:39.220 --> 01:33:40.744
He deserves it.

01:33:44.626 --> 01:33:46.856
Don't be ridiculous.

01:33:47.061 --> 01:33:50.519
Georgia Tech's one of the top
offensive teams in the country.

01:33:58.673 --> 01:34:01.938
You're an all-American
and our captain. Act like it.

01:34:03.344 --> 01:34:04.868
I believe I am.

01:34:14.656 --> 01:34:15.987
Me too, coach.

01:34:16.824 --> 01:34:19.122
I want Rudy to dress in my place.

01:34:23.298 --> 01:34:25.630
Coach, this is for Rudy.

01:34:28.503 --> 01:34:30.334
This is for Rudy, coach.

01:34:55.563 --> 01:34:57.827
I promise. This is the real thing.

01:34:58.433 --> 01:35:01.596
I'm gonna be on
the sidelines, in uniform.

01:35:04.706 --> 01:35:08.472
Frank, I've never asked you
for anything in my life.

01:35:08.676 --> 01:35:11.372
Promise me he'll be
on that bus tomorrow.

01:35:16.784 --> 01:35:20.242
Frank, I want you to be there too.

01:35:26.127 --> 01:35:27.355
Please.

01:36:09.237 --> 01:36:10.226
Here you go.

01:36:10.438 --> 01:36:12.463
What a day for a game, huh?

01:36:12.674 --> 01:36:13.936
You bet.

01:36:15.043 --> 01:36:17.273
All right. Go Irish!

01:36:17.478 --> 01:36:20.311
- Go Irish! Thank you.
- Thank you.

01:36:20.515 --> 01:36:23.109
I'll get you on the way back.
I don't got my wallet.

01:36:24.519 --> 01:36:25.577
This is our gate.

01:36:28.890 --> 01:36:29.982
Hey, Rudy?

01:36:32.960 --> 01:36:36.418
I just want you to know that
I think this is a great thing.

01:36:38.066 --> 01:36:39.090
Thanks.

01:36:40.068 --> 01:36:41.399
You're welcome.

01:37:16.304 --> 01:37:17.669
It's your day.

01:37:27.682 --> 01:37:31.118
- I wish you could be out there with me.
- I know.

01:37:47.168 --> 01:37:50.729
This is the most beautiful sight
these eyes have ever seen.

01:37:53.241 --> 01:37:54.572
Come on, Dad.

01:38:00.214 --> 01:38:01.545
Huddle up.

01:38:06.053 --> 01:38:07.782
Bring it in, guys.

01:38:11.793 --> 01:38:12.782
Father.

01:38:13.828 --> 01:38:15.693
Everyone, take a hand.

01:38:17.698 --> 01:38:19.859
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

01:38:20.067 --> 01:38:24.003
Blessed art thou among women and
blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

01:38:24.205 --> 01:38:27.106
Holy Mary, mother of God,
pray for us sinners now...

01:38:27.308 --> 01:38:28.832
...and at the hour of our death.

01:38:29.043 --> 01:38:30.032
Notre Dame, Our Mother.

01:38:30.344 --> 01:38:31.971
Pray for us!

01:38:40.221 --> 01:38:42.052
You all know what you have to do.

01:38:43.691 --> 01:38:44.919
Remember...

01:38:45.293 --> 01:38:46.157
...no one...

01:38:46.694 --> 01:38:50.027
...and I mean no one...

01:38:51.165 --> 01:38:54.794
...comes into our house
and pushes us around.

01:38:57.071 --> 01:38:59.596
This is your game now, gentlemen.

01:39:01.042 --> 01:39:04.170
And for you seniors, it's your
last one, so make it count...

01:39:05.112 --> 01:39:08.639
...because you'll remember it
for the rest of your lives.

01:39:13.955 --> 01:39:15.081
Let's get 'em.

01:40:01.002 --> 01:40:01.991
Rudy!

01:40:07.942 --> 01:40:09.273
You ready, champ?

01:40:09.477 --> 01:40:11.411
I've been ready
for this my whole life.

01:40:12.146 --> 01:40:14.273
Then you take us out on the field.

01:40:26.260 --> 01:40:27.557
All right, let's go.

01:40:42.944 --> 01:40:44.172
Here they go!

01:40:49.984 --> 01:40:52.748
- That's him. 45.
- 45. You see him?

01:40:59.594 --> 01:41:02.119
Forty-five! Forty-five!

01:41:02.330 --> 01:41:05.128
That's him! I know him!
That's Rudy!

01:41:13.107 --> 01:41:14.665
You guys already know this...

01:41:14.875 --> 01:41:17.673
...but this is the most important
game of your lives!

01:41:17.878 --> 01:41:20.369
No excuses! Do the work!

01:41:20.581 --> 01:41:23.106
- Our Lady of Victory!
- Pray for us!

01:41:33.461 --> 01:41:36.123
What the hell?
They're across the line.

01:41:51.078 --> 01:41:53.171
Watch number 70.
He's waltzing with him.

01:42:16.370 --> 01:42:19.533
Forty yards for
a Notre Dame touchdown.

01:43:12.626 --> 01:43:16.790
It's the fourth quarter with 3 minutes
to play and the issue still in doubt.

01:43:17.098 --> 01:43:21.831
As Barratt fades back to pass for
Georgia Tech from his 30-yard line.

01:43:22.036 --> 01:43:23.094
Looks upfield, throws.

01:43:23.904 --> 01:43:26.134
Intercepted by Roland Steelel

01:43:26.340 --> 01:43:28.638
He has a convoy of blockers
down the sidelines.

01:43:28.843 --> 01:43:33.644
Steele going in unmolested
for a Notre Dame touchdown.

01:43:33.848 --> 01:43:36.373
It's a backbreaker for Georgia Tech.

01:43:38.285 --> 01:43:40.845
Joe, play all the seniors!

01:43:41.088 --> 01:43:41.986
And Rudy?

01:43:42.990 --> 01:43:45.356
- Let him in for one play.
- Absolutely not.

01:43:47.962 --> 01:43:52.092
Coach, you gotta play him.
Come on, coach. One play.

01:43:57.304 --> 01:43:59.397
Give him a chance, coach!

01:43:59.607 --> 01:44:03.805
Notre Dame all over the ball.
Thompson recovers for the Irish.

01:44:09.150 --> 01:44:10.412
Rudy!

01:44:10.618 --> 01:44:13.212
Rudy! Rudy!

01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:17.288
Rudy! Rudy! Rudy!

01:44:37.645 --> 01:44:41.206
37 seconds remaining and it'll be
all over here at Notre Dame.

01:44:41.816 --> 01:44:43.010
To our left...

01:44:43.217 --> 01:44:46.482
...l'm picking up a chant
from the Notre Dame student body.

01:44:46.687 --> 01:44:48.985
Can't quite make out just what it is.

01:44:49.356 --> 01:44:54.225
Devine's gonna empty his bench with
a little time remaining in the game.

01:44:54.562 --> 01:44:58.259
One of the players going
into the game is Jamie O'Hare.

01:44:58.465 --> 01:45:03.129
O'Hare was heavily recruited throughout
the country several years ago.

01:45:03.337 --> 01:45:05.396
He came to Notre Dame...

01:45:05.606 --> 01:45:09.633
...and it's safe to say that
his career has been a disappointment.

01:45:17.384 --> 01:45:19.045
They're chanting for Rudy.

01:45:25.693 --> 01:45:27.627
Tell him to go to a knee.

01:45:35.870 --> 01:45:37.895
Listen up.
Victory formation.

01:45:38.539 --> 01:45:40.063
The hell with Devine.

01:45:40.274 --> 01:45:42.265
If the offense is here,
Rudy can't play.

01:45:42.476 --> 01:45:45.274
- We gotta run the play.
- No, we gotta score now.

01:45:45.713 --> 01:45:48.705
- Let's get a score for Rudy.
- It's the last game!

01:45:48.916 --> 01:45:51.646
All right, this one's yours.
Pro right.

01:45:51.852 --> 01:45:54.980
38 halfback pass on one.
On one. Ready?

01:46:27.021 --> 01:46:28.784
What the hell is he doing?

01:46:47.775 --> 01:46:52.439
Touchdown. Notre Dame, 23.
Georgia Tech, 3.

01:46:54.481 --> 01:46:55.914
That was for you.

01:46:58.719 --> 01:47:01.153
What was that?
Who called that play?

01:47:01.355 --> 01:47:02.913
It's just occurred to me...

01:47:03.123 --> 01:47:06.183
...what they've been chanting
for the last few minutes.

01:47:06.994 --> 01:47:08.962
It's the name "Rudy."

01:47:09.930 --> 01:47:12.899
Dan Ruettiger, a walk-on senior...

01:47:13.100 --> 01:47:17.867
...subject of an article in yesterday's
student newspaper, The Observer.

01:47:20.374 --> 01:47:22.706
All right, go get 'em, kid!

01:47:35.823 --> 01:47:36.812
He's so little!

01:47:50.371 --> 01:47:52.532
Come on. One more play.

01:47:55.776 --> 01:47:57.437
What do I do?

01:47:58.379 --> 01:48:00.108
Stay in. Stay there!

01:49:20.127 --> 01:49:22.493
Who's the wild man now?!

01:49:33.040 --> 01:49:34.337
That's it.

01:49:34.541 --> 01:49:35.872
You won.
