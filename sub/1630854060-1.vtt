Ms. Clark handed me

been getting tens of thousands

what you've been telling me.

-No!

to make a decision.

13:59.747 --> 14:01.541
We've been doing
our best to work with you.

14:01.943 --> 14:03.576
There are other options,

14:03.611 --> 14:05.919
like a convalescent home,
county--

14:05.954 --> 14:07.514
Nah, I have the payment.

14:18.197 --> 14:22.661
Just-- just-- just give
me three days. Just three more.

strings around here for you.

14:34.741 --> 14:36.246

14:41.055 --> 14:43.055
I've covered
you for as long as I could.

14:43.824 --> 14:45.992

down on me now.

14:46.027 --> 14:48.126
My back is against
the wall here.

14:49.591 --> 14:51.492
You know I care
about your family, Kev.

14:52.428 --> 14:55.199
But this new director
is asking so many questions.

14:55.234 --> 14:57.102
It's getting
harder to cover up for you.

15:00.536 --> 15:03.372
I'm not going to continue
jeopardizing my job.

15:03.707 --> 15:05.605
My head is on
the chopping block here.

15:05.640 --> 15:07.673
If I continue
to facilitate her here,

15:07.708 --> 15:09.983
with these
outstanding account charges?

15:11.382 --> 15:13.118
Listen,
we've been through a lot.

15:13.153 --> 15:15.483
I want to help you, but...

15:16.585 --> 15:19.454
Listen... get me three days,

15:19.489 --> 15:23.557
Lakisha, I promise. I promise.

15:24.659 --> 15:26.527
Okay. Kevin.

15:26.829 --> 15:29.134
Three days only,
but you're going to have

15:29.169 --> 15:32.401
to start paying on time...
and no more extensions.

15:34.042 --> 15:36.075
-Kevin?
-Yeah?

15:36.110 --> 15:37.978
How's everything
going in your personal life?

15:39.245 --> 15:40.541
It's...

15:40.576 --> 15:42.576
I mean, you know, it's good.

15:42.611 --> 15:44.017

15:44.486 --> 15:46.415
I know it's difficult
raising a daughter by yourself.

15:48.419 --> 15:50.386
Don't you think it's
time you start dating again?

15:51.290 --> 15:54.687
Uh... y-- Woo!

15:59.661 --> 16:02.464
What? Kevin? Okay.

16:02.499 --> 16:05.071

16:07.240 --> 16:08.734
Boss. Mazzetti's here.

16:14.247 --> 16:17.710
So Detective Mazzetti. You
ready to act like a cop today?

16:18.548 --> 16:20.053
-Funny.

16:20.088 --> 16:21.351
What you trying
to show me, man?

16:21.386 --> 16:22.814
I got stuff to do today, man.

16:22.849 --> 16:25.091
I got a video
of the thief that robbed me.

16:25.126 --> 16:26.554
-Okay.
-Come with me.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.658
Man, what
the hell is this, Max?

16:31.693 --> 16:33.066
Don't worry about him.

16:33.635 --> 16:36.234
He ain't nobody. Come here.

16:37.831 --> 16:40.337
So tell me,
Detective Frank Mazzetti,

16:40.939 --> 16:42.372
you recognize this thief?

16:42.941 --> 16:44.572
Now how am
I supposed to recognize him?

16:45.341 --> 16:47.575
Because you say
this is your city,

16:47.977 --> 16:50.083
and you know
every thief in this town.

16:54.155 --> 16:59.818
Can't do that.... but what
I can do is send this video

16:59.853 --> 17:01.325
to some informants.

17:02.460 --> 17:03.822
Streets are goin'
start talking,

17:04.724 --> 17:07.793
give me a couple of days,
see if I can dig something up.

17:09.533 --> 17:12.204
This thief took
something very personal to me,

17:12.239 --> 17:13.304
and I want it back.

17:14.538 --> 17:15.834
I understand.

17:21.446 --> 17:23.743
Wake him the fuck up.
Wake yo' ass.

17:25.615 --> 17:27.252
You ready to talk?

17:30.224 --> 17:31.817
Who got my fucking property?

17:32.219 --> 17:34.226
Yo' mama, motherfucker.

17:52.708 --> 17:54.213
Fucking Kevin Hunter.

18:03.488 --> 18:04.883
Detective Perez.

18:04.918 --> 18:06.621
Hello, beautiful.

18:06.656 --> 18:09.624
Beautiful? Frank,
you only call me beautiful

18:09.659 --> 18:12.660
when you want something.
So what is it?

18:13.229 --> 18:16.697
I need you to run a name
for me, Kevin Allan Hunter.

18:16.732 --> 18:18.402
-Can you do that?
-Okay.

18:20.208 --> 18:23.902
Um, when do you need this by?

18:25.345 --> 18:27.510
As soon as possible,
can you put a rush?

18:27.545 --> 18:29.710
Okay. I'll call you right back.

18:30.581 --> 18:31.910
Alright, great. Thank you.

18:47.301 --> 18:48.696
-Hey, guys. How's it going?
-What's up, chief?

18:48.731 --> 18:51.270
-What y'all doing tonight?
-I have no idea.

18:51.305 --> 18:52.799
-Hey, what's up, Perez?
-'Sup, guys?

18:53.934 --> 18:55.835
-What's up, captain?
-Hey, what's up?

19:02.250 --> 19:03.876
Frank. I was
just about to call you.

19:04.445 --> 19:07.715
Here's all the info on this
Kevin Allan Hunter.

19:08.117 --> 19:09.882
Thank you so much.
You're the best.

19:10.150 --> 19:11.620
No problem.

19:11.655 --> 19:12.951
I owe you one, aight?

19:35.811 --> 19:37.349
Hello?

19:37.384 --> 19:39.516
Mr. Mazzetti!

19:39.751 --> 19:42.013
Chuck Price here with
Urban and Funding Development.

19:42.048 --> 19:43.982
Chuck Price,
how can I help you?

19:44.017 --> 19:46.523
Well, Mr. Mazzetti, we have
a couple of problems here.

19:46.558 --> 19:48.921
Seems we never received
your quarterly funding reports.

19:50.397 --> 19:52.364
I'm in the process
of getting those to you.

19:52.399 --> 19:54.762
Give me by the end of the day,
and you'll have an email.

19:54.797 --> 19:56.467
Okay, Mr. Mazzetti.

19:56.669 --> 19:59.998
But your other problem is
I just heard Gabriel Cavallero

20:00.033 --> 20:02.671
was killed last night,
which means you no longer

20:02.706 --> 20:04.409
have an engineer
instructor for this program.

20:05.005 --> 20:06.378
Yeah.

20:07.777 --> 20:09.777
Um, I have someone
available to take his spot,

20:09.812 --> 20:11.350
so there's no need
to worry about that.

20:11.385 --> 20:12.483
Hm.

20:13.319 --> 20:15.486
Tell you what I can
do for you, Mr. Mazzetti.

20:16.188 --> 20:20.018
Have those reports and new
engineer instructor by Monday,

20:20.053 --> 20:22.790
or I'll have no other
choice but to give this grant

20:22.825 --> 20:24.363
to another program.

20:24.398 --> 20:25.562
Do you understand?

20:25.597 --> 20:26.827
I'll take care of it.

20:27.629 --> 20:29.962
I expect to hear from
you soon, Mr. Mazzetti.

20:30.866 --> 20:32.404
Have a good day.

20:43.582 --> 20:45.681
Chicken, rice and veggie
is your favorite food.

20:46.651 --> 20:47.914
Why aren't you eating, baby?

20:51.887 --> 20:54.360
Grandma says my hair
looks just like my mom's.

20:55.990 --> 20:59.695
Yes, baby. Your hair is--
your hair is just as beautiful.

21:01.864 --> 21:03.501
Is Mommy in heaven, Dad?

21:05.373 --> 21:08.407
Yes. Your mom
is in heaven, baby.

21:12.446 --> 21:13.907
I wish Mom was here.

21:17.682 --> 21:20.881
Mommy watches over us
now to make sure we're safe.

21:21.653 --> 21:22.817
Okay, baby?

21:23.985 --> 21:25.457
Mm hm.

21:26.159 --> 21:29.956
We have to be real
good to each other because...

21:30.827 --> 21:32.497
it's just you and me now.

21:34.831 --> 21:36.061
Okay.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.471
Call the foul!

21:40.407 --> 21:43.068
Man that shit-- see?
And he still got it.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.509
Should've been
an and-one.

21:44.744 --> 21:46.775
And they still can't stop it.

21:47.110 --> 21:49.041
-And they still can't stop us.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.080
What the fuck?

22:01.121 --> 22:03.594
I got you on
camera robbing Maxim Cavallero.

22:03.629 --> 22:05.530
Now, you have three options.

22:05.565 --> 22:08.434
I can tell him who you are,
which I know you don't want,

22:08.469 --> 22:09.897
you can go back to prison,

22:10.299 --> 22:11.965
or you can follow
these instructions.

22:12.634 --> 22:15.133
You're a smart man,
you'll make the right decision.

44:23.363 --> 44:24.736
it's the first
door on the right.

44:25.299 --> 44:26.771
Okay, thank you.

44:26.806 --> 44:28.135
Thank you, ma'am.

44:29.534 --> 44:31.138
-Mrs. Clark?

44:32.911 --> 44:34.042
How can I help you gentlemen?

44:34.411 --> 44:35.912
Hi. I'm Detective Burns.

44:36.147 --> 44:37.848
This is my partner,
Detective Hollister.

44:37.883 --> 44:39.784
-Ma'am.
-We're investigating a robbery,

44:39.819 --> 44:41.247
and we'd like to ask
you a few questions.

44:41.282 --> 44:42.820
Okay.

44:42.855 --> 44:45.152
Mrs. Clark,
do you recognize this card?

44:46.353 --> 44:47.924
Yes. It's my business card.

44:47.959 --> 44:49.288
Is there a problem,
Detective Hollister?

44:49.323 --> 44:50.487
We're not sure.

44:50.522 --> 44:52.456
Have you heard
of a Destiny Bingo Hall?

44:52.491 --> 44:54.029
Of course I have.

44:54.064 --> 44:55.998
They have commercials
running on TV all the time.

44:56.400 --> 44:58.869
Were you at the bingo
hall last night, Mrs. Clarke?

44:59.338 --> 45:03.302
No, I wasn't at any bingo hall.
I don't gamble.

45:03.337 --> 45:05.304
Do you know of anyone
that may have had your business

45:05.339 --> 45:07.405
card that goes
to the Destiny Bingo Hall?

45:07.440 --> 45:09.506
No, I'm sorry. I-- I don't.

45:09.908 --> 45:12.509
You see, Mrs. Clark,
the problem is that

45:12.544 --> 45:14.819
your card was found
at the scene of a crime.

45:15.488 --> 45:17.283
We're trying to figure
out why it was there.

45:18.484 --> 45:20.385
I'm sorry.
I wish I could help you,

45:20.420 --> 45:22.893
but I don't know why my
business card would be there.

45:22.928 --> 45:25.159
I give my card out
to lots of different people.

45:27.867 --> 45:30.296
Okay, Mrs. Clark.
Well, thank you for your time.

45:30.665 --> 45:32.133
And here's my card.

45:32.502 --> 45:34.399
If you happen
to think of anything,

45:34.434 --> 45:37.006
-please give us a call.
-Okay.

45:37.041 --> 45:38.337
-You have a good day.
-Mhm.

45:38.372 --> 45:39.910
Have a good day.

Answer the--

47:07.164 --> 47:08.966
What's up, Kev?

47:09.001 --> 47:10.462
You find out anything yet?

47:10.497 --> 47:12.134
I'm getting close.

47:12.803 --> 47:14.169
Things are starting to add up.

47:14.204 --> 47:15.599
Just give me
a little bit more time,

47:15.634 --> 47:16.941
and I have something for you.

47:17.570 --> 47:18.469
<i>I'm almost there.</i>

47:18.771 --> 47:23.541
Hey, aight, Carlos, man,
I need that info, bruh, ASAP.

47:23.576 --> 47:24.949
Okay. I got you.

47:28.383 --> 47:29.921
Fuck!

47:32.222 --> 47:34.453
-Yeah.
-Yeah? For sure.

47:34.488 --> 47:37.225
I'm sure. If you move that,
that'll be good.

47:41.099 --> 47:44.298
What's wrong, Mr. Hunter?
Your girl flaked on you?

47:47.699 --> 47:51.668
Nah, Shawn. It's all good.
I just had to, uh--

47:53.639 --> 47:55.980
You know, guys,
it's getting late.

47:56.015 --> 47:57.410
Let's just call it a night--

47:59.183 --> 48:02.283
-But I wrote two verses!
-What you mean late?

48:02.318 --> 48:05.121
Yeah, yeah.
It's getting up there,

48:05.156 --> 48:06.584
but at least we have, uh--

48:06.619 --> 48:09.125
-Come on!
-We got a decent beat going,

48:09.160 --> 48:11.391
we gon'-- we gon' keep
the vibes going tomorrow.

48:11.426 --> 48:15.032
You guys just think
of some ideas and we'll--

48:16.431 --> 48:18.233
-Tomorrow?
-we'll get it back in tomorrow.

48:18.268 --> 48:20.664
-Whatever.
-Well, guess I'm going home.

48:22.470 --> 48:24.338
-Good night, Mr. Hunter.
-Goodnight.

48:24.373 --> 48:26.373
-All right, guys.
-See you, Mr. Hunter.

48:26.408 --> 48:28.309
-Good night, Mr. Hunter.
-Thank you.

48:45.295 --> 48:46.558
Here you go.

48:47.363 --> 48:49.066
Be careful, baby.

48:49.101 --> 48:50.199
The plate's hot.

48:50.568 --> 48:54.401
Wow. I can't
believe you cooked for me.

48:54.436 --> 48:56.568
Come on, now.
Anything for you, baby.

48:56.603 --> 48:58.042
Muah!

49:04.545 --> 49:07.381
Mm, smells good, too.

49:07.416 --> 49:09.746
That's right. You know
I ain't no rookie.

49:11.420 --> 49:14.157
Look at you,
trying to be romantic.

49:16.161 --> 49:19.393
Trying? Just wait 'til dessert.

49:37.281 --> 49:38.445
Here you go, Daddy.

49:38.747 --> 49:40.414
Y'all want something to drink?

49:40.449 --> 49:41.448
- Nah, I'm straight.

49:42.317 --> 49:45.023
Nah, I'm good.
But we got a problem, Trey.

49:46.224 --> 49:47.355
And what's that?

49:47.590 --> 49:49.522
Man, you know them
linguini-eating motherfuckers

49:49.557 --> 49:51.029
trying to take over
our shit, right?

49:51.493 --> 49:52.591
Yep.

49:52.626 --> 49:55.066
Man, no bitches
ain't taking over shit.

49:55.101 --> 49:58.069
If they want to go to war,
we going to take 'em to war.

49:58.404 --> 50:00.170
You know them
motherfuckers killed Black.

50:00.505 --> 50:03.041
They put a X on his head
just to let us know who did it.

50:04.176 --> 50:05.571
Man, fuck Black!

50:05.940 --> 50:08.046
You think I give a fuck
about Black?

50:08.348 --> 50:09.608
He was doing business
with them guido,

50:09.643 --> 50:12.083
gwap, goomba
motherfuckers, man.

50:14.615 --> 50:16.120
So what you want to do, Trey?

50:23.426 --> 50:27.230
Look, I need everybody to keep
their guards up right now,

50:27.799 --> 50:31.366
and report back to me any
disruptions in our operations.

50:31.735 --> 50:33.500
And if y'all see
one of them spaghetti,

50:33.535 --> 50:35.865
ravioli-eatin'
motherfuckers in our territory,

50:35.900 --> 50:37.471
smoke they ass on site.

50:42.247 --> 50:43.543
- What's up with this?

50:43.578 --> 50:45.578
Every time I come down here,
it's a different bill.

50:46.080 --> 50:47.778
Or you could speak
to my manager.

50:47.813 --> 50:50.484
I ain't speakin' to no manager.
I'm out of here.

50:52.653 --> 50:55.555
-Oh. Hey, Mario.
-Um, hi, Jada.

50:55.590 --> 50:57.590
I'm here to pay
my mom's bill again.

50:58.230 --> 50:59.328
Yeah, okay.

50:59.693 --> 51:00.725
So...

51:03.268 --> 51:04.399
here's 200.

51:05.501 --> 51:06.698
Yeah, that will do.

51:07.133 --> 51:09.173
Oh, by the way, Jada?

51:09.208 --> 51:11.703
Do you know Mrs. Lopez
that lives next door to us?

51:11.738 --> 51:13.375
-Mhm?
-Apartment number six?

51:13.905 --> 51:15.212
Yeah, I know her.

51:15.547 --> 51:17.214
Can you tell me how
much her bill is?

51:17.249 --> 51:18.710
'Cause I've seen her
going across the street

51:18.745 --> 51:20.679
to the neighbor's
just to get a bucket of water.

51:20.714 --> 51:22.747
So, uh, I think her
water's off or something.

51:23.149 --> 51:24.452
-Yeah. Hold on.

51:25.154 --> 51:27.422
Yeah. I'm really
not supposed to do that,

51:27.457 --> 51:30.887
but for you this time,
um, one second.

51:34.893 --> 51:36.398
Yeah. She's, like,
three months behind.

51:36.433 --> 51:38.433
They cut it off,
like, last week.

51:39.436 --> 51:40.897
Um, how much is it?

51:41.867 --> 51:43.174
Let me check for you.

51:44.441 --> 51:46.342
Let's see.

51:47.246 --> 51:48.443
One second.

51:50.546 --> 51:51.908
Thank you, by the way.

51:51.943 --> 51:54.284
-Um...

51:54.319 --> 51:56.253
With the late fees,
I can wave those,

51:57.256 --> 51:58.915
we're looking at like 175.

52:00.358 --> 52:03.755
Um, all right,
you know what? Here's...

52:05.891 --> 52:07.231
Here's 300.

52:07.600 --> 52:08.727
That should
be enough to cover

52:08.762 --> 52:09.860
her next bill when it's due.

52:11.600 --> 52:12.764
That's really nice
of you, Mario.

52:13.932 --> 52:15.437
You tell your mom
I said hi, okay?

52:15.472 --> 52:16.504
-All right, thanks Jada.
-All right.

52:17.340 --> 52:19.672
-Hey, what's up, Rico?
-Hey, Mario.

52:19.707 --> 52:20.838
Next, please.

52:21.240 --> 52:22.609
Aight man,
take care, all right?

52:22.644 --> 52:23.940
Hello,
I'm here to pay my bills.

52:23.975 --> 52:26.811
Mhm. Okay,
give me just, like, one second.

52:32.357 --> 52:33.455
Hey, Jess.

52:33.490 --> 52:34.555
Hey, Mario.

52:54.709 --> 52:56.214
Hey, Ma, how you doing?

52:58.977 --> 53:01.582
Oh, you forgot
to give your<i> nanay</i> a hug?

53:02.453 --> 53:03.716
Of course, Ma. I'm sorry.

53:05.489 --> 53:08.754
Oh, Mom, by the way,
I made some hit records today.

53:08.789 --> 53:10.723
I'm gonna take good care
of you and Angela.

53:10.758 --> 53:11.889
Me too?

53:11.924 --> 53:14.727
Especially you, Angela,
and you know what?

53:15.829 --> 53:16.894
This is for you, Mom.

53:17.730 --> 53:19.303
You know,
it's just a little something

53:19.338 --> 53:20.469
to help with the bills

53:20.504 --> 53:22.240
and get you guys
something nice to wear.

53:22.575 --> 53:25.474
Ooh, that's what I'm talking
about! Thanks, Mario.

53:25.876 --> 53:27.872
You know what? I got everyone.

53:27.907 --> 53:29.643
No more of this
everyday struggling.

53:30.245 --> 53:31.810
Where did you get this money?

53:35.585 --> 53:36.617
Hard work, Mom.

53:37.252 --> 53:41.589
Hard work? Hard work from
where? From your music?

53:41.991 --> 53:43.723
You know what?
Where's Dad? Huh?

53:44.292 --> 53:45.956
And when is the last time
we seen him?

53:48.796 --> 53:51.302
What is he even ever done
for us? He's the one that left.

53:52.536 --> 53:53.964
I'mma take care of us,
all right?

53:55.341 --> 53:56.703
I love you, Mario.

53:56.938 --> 53:58.804
Of course, Angela. I got you.

53:59.339 --> 54:00.872
I know just the outfit I want,

54:00.907 --> 54:02.643
I gotta tell Abby
we're shopping tomorrow.

54:03.045 --> 54:07.912
Aight. But, Mom, wait 'til
we drop this new single.

54:07.947 --> 54:09.848
I'm telling you,
we got something special.

54:10.417 --> 54:12.015
I'm proud of you,<i> anak.</i>

54:12.050 --> 54:14.787
But you be careful with
those music people,

54:14.822 --> 54:16.723
I've heard some nasty things.

54:17.392 --> 54:20.463
I'll be okay, Mom. But as soon
as I get enough money,

54:20.498 --> 54:23.433
I'mma buy you a house
and you ain't working no more.

54:23.835 --> 54:25.369
Oh, sweetie, I love you.

54:26.504 --> 54:27.536
Of course, Mom.

54:33.071 --> 54:35.346
Hey, Kevin. Please come in.

54:38.978 --> 54:40.076
It's all there.

54:40.111 --> 54:41.418
Full payment?

54:41.653 --> 54:42.683
Paid in full.

54:43.452 --> 54:47.391
What? Okay,
and next month's payment?

54:48.592 --> 54:49.789
It'll be on time.

54:50.462 --> 54:51.494
Good.

54:52.464 --> 54:53.296
Good.

54:53.599 --> 54:57.335
Well, good. So, what are
your plans for the night?

54:57.704 --> 55:01.471
Ugh. Tonight, I gotta look
for a needle in a haystack.

55:03.508 --> 55:04.870
Is there anything
I can help you with?

55:06.973 --> 55:09.446
Nah, I gotta do this on my own.

55:11.780 --> 55:13.780
Well, you know I'm always here
for you if you need me.

55:15.784 --> 55:16.915
I know, Kisha.

55:19.623 --> 55:20.655
Thanks for everything.

55:29.930 --> 55:30.962
How's your food?

55:31.965 --> 55:33.063
Seasoned.

55:33.098 --> 55:36.374
-I heard that.

55:45.044 --> 55:46.516
Is everything okay?

55:47.151 --> 55:49.046
Yeah, Ma, everything's fine.

55:52.051 --> 55:55.052
Don't act like I don't know
what's going on, son.

55:55.954 --> 55:58.154
I was just dropping off
a payment to Lakisha.

55:58.959 --> 56:00.662
You got a new job?

56:01.797 --> 56:02.928
As a matter of fact,

56:02.963 --> 56:04.831
I'm working on music
in a youth program.

56:09.739 --> 56:12.575
Well, everything is
going to be fine.

56:12.610 --> 56:14.643
Yeah, Ma, I'm happy.

56:16.713 --> 56:20.011
Kevin, when is the last time

56:20.046 --> 56:21.947
you paid respect
to your father?

56:27.185 --> 56:28.591
Uh, it's been a while.

56:32.025 --> 56:33.057
It's time to go, baby.

56:33.292 --> 56:35.961
Okay. Bye, Grandma.

56:36.733 --> 56:38.029
Bye-bye, honey.

56:42.970 --> 56:44.772
Come back
and see me soon.

56:45.544 --> 56:46.576
Okay.

56:57.820 --> 56:58.885
So, how's your ice cream?

56:59.187 --> 57:00.623
It's good.

57:01.325 --> 57:03.461
I just want you to know
how proud of you I am.

57:03.930 --> 57:06.090
You've been making a lot
of progress at school, and...

57:08.534 --> 57:09.929
I just love
to see you do good.

57:10.531 --> 57:12.635
Does everybody want
to see me do good?

57:13.104 --> 57:17.134
Mm, They do.
Just never better than them.

57:18.808 --> 57:21.479
-Hm. Okay.
-Come on, baby. Let's cut out.

57:22.944 --> 57:26.550
Keep up the good work,
keep the grades up,

57:27.152 --> 57:28.552
I'll get you
all the sprinkles

57:28.587 --> 57:29.982
and all the ice cream
in the world.

57:31.282 --> 57:33.953
So we gon' hit him
with the Bill Cosby juice,

57:33.988 --> 57:36.120
then we gon' bust in,
take all the dough

57:36.155 --> 57:38.188
-and the money, all right?
-All right, I got you.

57:38.993 --> 57:40.025
I'm so proud of you.

57:40.327 --> 57:41.730
What up, Trey?

57:43.998 --> 57:48.066
Hey, what's up, little mama?
You remember Uncle Trey?

57:48.301 --> 57:49.837
Mhm.

57:49.872 --> 57:51.674
Man, you done got big.

57:51.976 --> 57:53.544
You know, if you ever need
anything,

57:53.579 --> 57:55.040
-you can call me, okay?
-Okay.

57:55.075 --> 57:56.613
What grade you in, now?

57:56.648 --> 57:57.713
Trey, man. We need to talk.

57:58.048 --> 57:59.979
Me and you ain't got nothing
to talk about.

58:00.214 --> 58:01.684
Man, you still
holding grudges--

58:01.719 --> 58:02.952
Now, hold up.

58:02.987 --> 58:04.951
Nah, hold up, hold up.
It's cool, it's cool. I got it.

58:04.986 --> 58:07.822
Look, check this out.
On the strength of Michelle,

58:07.857 --> 58:09.219
I'll hold it down for Kayla.

58:09.521 --> 58:12.090
But me and you
ain't got shit to talk about.

58:12.358 --> 58:14.191
Man, we boys.

58:14.660 --> 58:17.095
Nah, we was boys.
Come on,

58:17.130 --> 58:18.195
Trey!

58:18.230 --> 58:19.999
-Bye, Kayla.
-Bye.

58:21.739 --> 58:22.837
Come on.

58:27.613 --> 58:29.173
How come you guys
don't talk to each other?

58:29.208 --> 58:30.878
I like Uncle Trey.

58:33.377 --> 58:35.245
Sometimes people
who are close friends

58:35.280 --> 58:37.016
have a disagreement and...

58:39.823 --> 58:41.724
It's just always better
to talk things out

58:41.759 --> 58:43.792
before they turn
to bad feelings.

58:43.827 --> 58:45.222
-Okay, Kayla?
-Mhm.

58:57.740 --> 59:00.941
Man fuck that shit. Run me
my money for the concrete job

59:00.976 --> 59:02.008
'fore the goons pull up.

59:03.946 --> 59:05.583
Somebody killed my nephew.

59:06.385 --> 59:08.751
You find out
who killed my nephew, Frank,

59:08.786 --> 59:10.082
and you find out now!

59:10.617 --> 59:13.085
they killed one of mine's,
I'mma kill ten of theirs!

59:14.924 --> 59:16.022
I'm tired of hearing about

59:16.057 --> 59:17.793
what the fuck
you gonna to find out.

59:17.828 --> 59:19.795
You find out

59:45.317 --> 59:47.658
Carlos, what's up man?
What you got?

59:47.926 --> 59:49.726
I got a ping on the cell phone.

59:50.927 --> 59:52.795
A ping? Where?

59:52.830 --> 59:54.291
It was at
the police station, Kevin.

59:55.998 --> 59:57.393
-Police station?
-<i> Yeah.</i>

59:57.828 --> 59:59.637
And I checked it three times.

1:00:00.039 --> 1:00:01.969
It's the police station
downtown on Fifth.

1:00:03.841 --> 1:00:06.743
All right, Carlos, man.
Good work. Thanks.

1:00:07.445 --> 1:00:09.680
-Talk to you later, man.
-<i> Kev, hold on.</i>

1:00:09.715 --> 1:00:11.407
You ain't in some kind
of trouble, are you?

1:00:12.109 --> 1:00:17.050
Yeah, man. I'm deep in it.
Gotta figure a way out.

1:00:17.987 --> 1:00:19.085
Call me if you need me.

1:00:20.858 --> 1:00:22.660
Right. All right, man. I will.

1:00:45.850 --> 1:00:46.882
Hey!

1:00:48.314 --> 1:00:50.688
Come on, you know why I'm here.

1:00:57.862 --> 1:00:59.158
-It's all here?
-Yup.

1:01:02.834 --> 1:01:04.064
See what happens
when you pay on time?

1:01:04.433 --> 1:01:05.967
We don't have
any problems, right?

1:01:06.002 --> 1:01:07.331
-Right.
-Yeah.

1:01:07.366 --> 1:01:08.464
-You guys have a good day.
-Mhm.

1:01:33.898 --> 1:01:35.359
Be a difference.

1:01:39.233 --> 1:01:41.233
-'Sup, Mario?
-Oh, wassup Buddha?

1:01:41.268 --> 1:01:42.399
-Shit. Chillin'?
-How you doing?

1:01:42.434 --> 1:01:44.170
-Good, good.
-Okay, fo' sho'.

1:01:44.205 --> 1:01:45.270
Who's your girl?

1:01:45.305 --> 1:01:46.876
Oh, nah, nah.
That's my friend.

1:01:46.911 --> 1:01:49.340
Okay, she wanna fuck

1:01:49.375 --> 1:01:51.078

1:01:51.113 --> 1:01:53.949
Hey, hey. She got a mans

It don't matter to me, baby.

1:01:55.117 --> 1:01:56.380
-Aight, Buddha.
-Aight.

1:01:56.415 --> 1:01:57.414
Aight.

1:01:58.150 --> 1:01:59.988
I got the hottest bars
in that track.

1:02:00.023 --> 1:02:01.220
-You think so?
-Yeah.

1:02:01.255 --> 1:02:02.054
I don't think so.

1:02:02.290 --> 1:02:04.091
I think my bars
are pretty good, actually, too.

1:02:04.126 --> 1:02:05.257
-Aight. Hold on.

1:02:05.292 --> 1:02:07.798
Hold on, hold on, hold on.
Yo, what's up?

1:02:10.594 --> 1:02:12.231
Aight. Aight, word.

1:02:14.301 --> 1:02:15.465
Hey Rio, who was that?

1:02:15.500 --> 1:02:18.270
Oh s-- Oh, man,

1:02:18.305 --> 1:02:20.239
Yeah, I got to go see

1:02:20.274 --> 1:02:21.471
So, uh, I'll be right back.

1:02:21.506 --> 1:02:23.209
You ain't got no honeys, fool.

1:02:23.244 --> 1:02:25.981
All you got is a pack of rats.
Hood rats.

1:02:26.016 --> 1:02:28.181
Yeah, come on, Rio.
You full of shit, man.

1:02:28.216 --> 1:02:30.821
I know who you was talkin' to,
I know what you about to go do.

1:02:30.856 --> 1:02:32.988
I told you, you was gonna get
caught up in that shit, man.

1:02:33.023 --> 1:02:36.288
Hey, man, what shit, Elijah?
Stop telling me what you think.

1:02:36.323 --> 1:02:38.521
You need to be thinking about
making this paper with me.

1:02:38.556 --> 1:02:39.962
Man, whatever.

1:02:39.997 --> 1:02:41.491
Man, let him go, man.

1:02:41.526 --> 1:02:42.866
Don't nobody
want to be around you

1:02:42.901 --> 1:02:44.263
and them
dirty hood rats anyway.

1:02:44.298 --> 1:02:45.528
Yeah, whatever, Anthony.

1:02:46.030 --> 1:02:47.970
You just mad
you ain't getting no paper.

1:02:50.304 --> 1:02:51.369
Rio...

1:03:03.581 --> 1:03:04.987
Hey, what's up Frank?

1:03:05.022 --> 1:03:06.021
Man, come on, get in.

1:03:14.460 --> 1:03:15.492
You got that shit?

1:03:16.968 --> 1:03:18.231
What's my name, Frank?

1:03:18.266 --> 1:03:19.364
Stop playing with me. Come on.

1:03:20.972 --> 1:03:22.004
Aight.

1:03:27.209 --> 1:03:28.307
It's all here?

1:03:28.342 --> 1:03:30.078
Yeah, everything you asked for.

1:03:31.642 --> 1:03:33.246
Man, what? You don't trust me?

1:03:33.281 --> 1:03:34.610
Man, I trust you.
I'm just checking.

1:03:35.250 --> 1:03:36.315
Aight.

1:03:38.253 --> 1:03:39.318
Okay, okay.

1:03:41.355 --> 1:03:42.486
Cool, cool, cool.

1:03:44.424 --> 1:03:45.456
This for you.

1:03:46.624 --> 1:03:49.097
Ooh, that's what
I'm talkin' about.

1:03:50.661 --> 1:03:52.001
Is it all here?

1:03:52.036 --> 1:03:54.465
Nah, man,
I'm just playing.

1:03:54.500 --> 1:03:55.598
I trust you, Frank.

1:03:58.009 --> 1:03:59.338
-Hey, look.
-'Sup?

1:03:59.373 --> 1:04:01.076
I'mma gonna need twice as much
next time, all right?

1:04:01.478 --> 1:04:04.640
Twice as much?
I mean, what you doing with it?

1:04:05.142 --> 1:04:06.543
There you go
asking questions, man.

1:04:06.578 --> 1:04:07.984
You trying to get this money
or not?

1:04:08.252 --> 1:04:09.118
Can a bird fly?

1:04:09.354 --> 1:04:11.922
Man, just hit me and
I'll have it for you, aight?

1:04:11.957 --> 1:04:14.254
Cool, and nobody knows about
our little arrangement, right?

1:04:14.289 --> 1:04:15.618
Hell nah!

1:04:15.653 --> 1:04:16.960
As a matter of fact,

1:04:16.995 --> 1:04:18.258
let me get the hell out of here

1:04:18.293 --> 1:04:19.622
before somebody
see me with you.

1:04:19.657 --> 1:04:20.456
Yeah.

1:04:20.792 --> 1:04:22.460
I don't want 'em thinking
I'm working with no cop.

1:04:23.529 --> 1:04:25.199
Aight, man,
just hit me, all right?

1:04:25.234 --> 1:04:28.202
-All right, man. Be smooth.
-Aight, you too. See ya, Frank.

1:04:34.507 --> 1:04:37.475
Stop slamming my door! Damn.

1:04:45.551 --> 1:04:46.649
<i> Hello?</i>

1:04:46.684 --> 1:04:49.487
Yo, what's up with it?

1:04:50.325 --> 1:04:51.357
'Sup, Trey?

1:04:51.692 --> 1:04:53.689
Yeah, I got another job
for you, man.

1:04:54.291 --> 1:04:59.332
It's easy, too.
In and out. You down?

1:05:00.566 --> 1:05:03.666
Yeah. Uh, but can you give me,
like, an hour?

1:05:04.702 --> 1:05:08.440
Aight, Aight. That's what's up.
Meet me at the spot then.

1:05:11.078 --> 1:05:12.983
Aight.
I'll see you there, Trey.

1:05:33.137 --> 1:05:34.301
What we got?

1:05:34.336 --> 1:05:35.599
A young Asian male,

1:05:35.634 --> 1:05:37.205
looks like he's been here
for a while.

1:05:41.139 --> 1:05:42.639
They sure did a number on him.

1:05:44.082 --> 1:05:45.444
See the X on his forehead?

1:05:47.217 --> 1:05:49.085
Look like Max's crew
is at it again.

1:05:50.286 --> 1:05:51.714
Yeah, but that's a kid, man.

1:05:51.749 --> 1:05:53.485
Yeah, but he got
caught up in something.

1:05:53.520 --> 1:05:54.783
Hey.

1:05:54.818 --> 1:05:56.785
Call Mazzetti.
Let's see if he know this kid.

1:05:56.820 --> 1:05:58.226
I just radioed him.

1:05:58.261 --> 1:05:59.458
He said he'd be here in a sec.

1:05:59.726 --> 1:06:01.031
All right.

1:06:03.563 --> 1:06:06.003
No casings. It's clean.

1:06:06.939 --> 1:06:09.303
Still have a cell phone on him?

1:06:10.207 --> 1:06:11.470
Hey, Mazzetti.

1:06:20.481 --> 1:06:21.579
You know this kid?

1:06:21.847 --> 1:06:23.119
Yeah.

1:06:27.323 --> 1:06:29.719
Okay. I'll meet you later
at Lorenzo's.

1:06:32.328 --> 1:06:34.658
And you always trying to be
cool with your fucking glasses.

1:06:34.693 --> 1:06:36.066
We in the damn house.

1:06:36.101 --> 1:06:37.463
Girl, get the fuck
out of here.

1:06:43.570 --> 1:06:45.108
Get the fuck
out of my way, dog.

1:06:45.143 --> 1:06:46.307
-Fuck you, man.
-Fuck out of here.

1:06:46.342 --> 1:06:47.539
Maxim, where the hell are you?

1:06:47.574 --> 1:06:49.112
Are you fucking
frisking me, man? Fuck this.

1:06:49.147 --> 1:06:49.979
I'll call you back.

1:06:50.382 --> 1:06:53.545
Maxim, I need to talk to you
right now. Fuck off me, man.

1:06:53.580 --> 1:06:54.744
I said get the fuck off me.

1:06:54.779 --> 1:06:56.152
I'mma send
all you motherfuckers

1:06:56.187 --> 1:06:57.549
back to where the fuck
y'all came from.

1:06:57.584 --> 1:06:59.551
-Punk ass motherfucker.
-The fuck out of here.

1:06:59.986 --> 1:07:01.784
Are you doing
your fucking job, Detective?

1:07:02.453 --> 1:07:04.457
I told you
let me handle it my way

1:07:04.725 --> 1:07:06.393
and you went
and killed the fucking kid!

1:07:07.496 --> 1:07:10.298
He had nothing to do with
the robbery or Gabriel's death.

1:07:12.302 --> 1:07:13.433
And you motherfuckers think

1:07:13.468 --> 1:07:15.270
you can get away
with this shit in my town?

1:07:15.639 --> 1:07:16.471
Your town?

1:07:16.873 --> 1:07:19.406
You don't even know what the
fuck goes down in your town.

1:07:19.441 --> 1:07:20.638
You're killing innocent people,

1:07:20.673 --> 1:07:22.475
and it's going
to lead straight to me.

1:07:23.110 --> 1:07:24.840
Now, I'm warning you, man.

1:07:25.645 --> 1:07:27.183
Don't fuck with me.

1:07:28.285 --> 1:07:29.449
I know everything.

1:07:30.617 --> 1:07:31.682
Ain't that right?

1:07:34.555 --> 1:07:36.324
Maxim Cavallero.

1:07:41.166 --> 1:07:42.198
I know your contacts.

1:07:42.926 --> 1:07:44.398
I'll start naming names.

1:07:45.830 --> 1:07:48.501
Starting with the politicians
on your fucking payroll!

1:07:49.768 --> 1:07:51.372
So are you threatening me,
Frank?

1:07:53.673 --> 1:07:55.475
You show me
some fucking respect.

1:07:59.811 --> 1:08:03.120
All I'm trying to say
is let me handle this my way.

1:08:05.355 --> 1:08:07.619
You know that fucking box
that got taken from me?

1:08:07.654 --> 1:08:11.590
Do you know what was
inside that box? Huh?

1:08:15.228 --> 1:08:17.299
Now tell me why
I shouldn't kill you right now?

1:08:20.535 --> 1:08:22.172
Because I know
who has your box.

1:08:24.341 --> 1:08:26.902
Now he knows
who has my fucking box!

1:08:29.214 --> 1:08:30.345
Who has my box?

1:08:35.715 --> 1:08:36.780
His name is Kevin Hunter.

1:08:38.916 --> 1:08:40.850
I grew up with him
I can find him.

1:08:43.558 --> 1:08:44.623
Give me 24 hours.

1:08:47.793 --> 1:08:49.265
You got 24 hours.

1:08:50.067 --> 1:08:52.928
I want my box,
I want this Kevin Hunter,

1:08:54.097 --> 1:08:57.207
or some more fucking people
in your town of coming up dead,

1:08:57.542 --> 1:08:58.604
startin' with you.

1:09:03.710 --> 1:09:04.841
Show his fucking ass out.

1:09:04.876 --> 1:09:06.381
Fucking piece of
shit out of here.

1:09:06.416 --> 1:09:07.481
Fuck outta here.

1:09:16.360 --> 1:09:17.821
-Hey, Mr. Hunter.
-Hey.

1:09:18.557 --> 1:09:19.856
-What's up, man?
-'Sup?

1:09:19.891 --> 1:09:21.528
All right, everybody,
come on in.

1:09:21.563 --> 1:09:22.727
-Let's get settled.
-Hey.

1:09:22.762 --> 1:09:24.795
We got a lot of work
to do today.

1:09:25.197 --> 1:09:26.434
Is everybody here?

1:09:26.733 --> 1:09:27.798
No.

1:09:28.534 --> 1:09:30.636
Mr. Hunter,
Mario ain't here yet.

1:09:31.375 --> 1:09:33.309
What? Where is he?

1:09:34.037 --> 1:09:35.278
Has anybody seen him?

1:09:35.546 --> 1:09:36.741
We were all with him last night

1:09:36.776 --> 1:09:38.677
and he had to go do something.

1:09:38.712 --> 1:09:39.777
He just took off.

1:09:40.513 --> 1:09:43.418
I see. That's what I've been
trying to tell you guys.

1:09:43.753 --> 1:09:46.322
You got to be focused
to make this thing happen.

1:09:46.624 --> 1:09:49.721
Now, he's not here,
but it's slowing up everything.

1:09:50.356 --> 1:09:52.988
I got that beat
you gave me a while ago,

1:09:53.023 --> 1:09:54.264
can I just finish that?

1:09:55.399 --> 1:09:57.729
Sure. Let's get it.
Jennifer, you up.

1:09:57.764 --> 1:09:58.928
All right.

1:10:01.372 --> 1:10:03.768
Hey, Ant. That ain't like Rio
to just miss class, man.

1:10:03.803 --> 1:10:05.242
Something ain't right.

1:10:05.844 --> 1:10:08.905
Yeah, I was just thinking
the same thing, man.

1:10:09.173 --> 1:10:11.281
Whatever he in, man,
he deep in it.

1:10:11.844 --> 1:10:12.909
Yeah, man.

1:10:17.784 --> 1:10:18.915
Hey, Ray.

1:10:18.950 --> 1:10:19.949
Hey, Miss Wanda.

1:10:21.887 --> 1:10:24.492
Mrs. Clark,
the detectives are back.

1:10:25.363 --> 1:10:26.395
They're back?

1:10:30.731 --> 1:10:31.796
I'm outta here.

1:10:36.033 --> 1:10:37.307
Excuse me, Miss Clark.

1:10:38.176 --> 1:10:40.673
Hello, gentlemen. Did you
find out why my business card

1:10:40.708 --> 1:10:41.540
was at the bingo hall?

1:10:41.743 --> 1:10:44.347
No, not yet. We are here
to ask some questions

1:10:44.382 --> 1:10:45.711
about one of your students.

1:10:45.746 --> 1:10:47.713
One of my students? Which one?

1:10:48.148 --> 1:10:49.979
Mario Hernandez.

1:10:50.014 --> 1:10:51.079
Mario.

1:10:51.114 --> 1:10:52.817
What did he do now?

1:10:53.119 --> 1:10:55.886
We don't know. He was murdered
earlier this morning.

1:10:55.921 --> 1:10:57.987
-Oh, my God. No!

1:10:58.022 --> 1:11:00.858
Mario, murdered?
Oh, my God.

1:11:00.893 --> 1:11:02.299
Have a seat, Miss Clark.

1:11:02.862 --> 1:11:04.466
Mario, no!

1:11:05.766 --> 1:11:08.668
Mrs. Clark, when was
the last time you saw Mario?

1:11:09.803 --> 1:11:12.474
I saw him here yesterday
at school.

1:11:12.509 --> 1:11:14.740
Did he say if he was
having any trouble with anyone?

1:11:15.578 --> 1:11:17.545
No, not to me.

1:11:17.914 --> 1:11:19.943
Do you think
any of your students would know

1:11:19.978 --> 1:11:21.483
of his whereabouts last night?

1:11:22.849 --> 1:11:24.783
I don't know,
but we can ask them.

1:11:25.819 --> 1:11:27.819
They're at the recording studio

1:11:27.854 --> 1:11:29.986
with their instructor,
Mr. Hunter.

1:11:30.021 --> 1:11:31.053
Where is that?

1:11:31.588 --> 1:11:36.861
That's three blocks away
at 1651 Martin Luther King Way.

1:11:37.630 --> 1:11:41.536
Mrs. Clark, we're also here
to investigate another homicide

1:11:41.571 --> 1:11:43.032
of a Gabriel Cavallero.

1:11:43.067 --> 1:11:45.100
We was told he was working here.

1:11:45.702 --> 1:11:49.038
He did. Do you think
the two were connected?

1:11:49.073 --> 1:11:51.579
We don't know. That's what
we're here to find out.

1:11:51.847 --> 1:11:52.976
Do you still have my card?

1:11:54.749 --> 1:11:57.717
Please. If you can think
of anything, anything at all,

1:11:58.119 --> 1:11:59.356
please give us a call.

1:12:00.557 --> 1:12:02.084
-I will.
-Thank you, Mrs. Clark.

1:12:02.119 --> 1:12:03.393
Thank you.

1:12:03.428 --> 1:12:04.427
Thank you, Miss Clark.

1:12:09.626 --> 1:12:11.665
Hey, Mr. Hunter.
Police just pulled up.

1:12:12.701 --> 1:12:13.766
Aw, thanks, Shawn.

1:12:17.068 --> 1:12:18.166
Kevin Hunter?

1:12:18.201 --> 1:12:19.475
Yeah, I'm Kevin.

1:12:20.177 --> 1:12:22.907
Um, we'd like to ask you
a few questions outside.

1:12:23.376 --> 1:12:27.615
Okay, uh, y'all keep this going,
it sound great.

1:12:28.017 --> 1:12:29.111
I'll be right back.

1:12:29.680 --> 1:12:31.883
-What's that about?

1:12:34.217 --> 1:12:35.656
I'm Detective Burns,

1:12:35.691 --> 1:12:37.427
this is my partner,
Detective Hollister.

1:12:37.962 --> 1:12:40.496
We're here to investigate
a homicide.

1:12:40.531 --> 1:12:41.530
A homicide?

1:12:42.566 --> 1:12:43.862
Yeah. Mr. Hunter.

1:12:43.897 --> 1:12:46.766
Mario Hernandez was murdered
this morning.

1:12:48.572 --> 1:12:51.606
What? How? What happened?

1:12:51.874 --> 1:12:53.509
We're trying to figure that out.

1:12:53.544 --> 1:12:56.006
When was the last time
you saw Mario Hernandez?

1:12:56.808 --> 1:12:59.746
I saw him yesterday,
here in the studio.

1:13:00.881 --> 1:13:02.749
Did he say where
he's going after class?

1:13:03.051 --> 1:13:05.015
No. I mean, not to me he didn't,

1:13:05.050 --> 1:13:07.050
but I know he was with some
other students when he left.

1:13:07.419 --> 1:13:09.052
Can we talk
to these other students?

1:13:09.554 --> 1:13:11.725
Yeah, yeah, sure. Come on.

1:13:19.163 --> 1:13:22.802
All right, everyone.
I need you to listen up.

1:13:22.837 --> 1:13:25.541
I'm afraid I have some--
some terrible news.

1:13:25.776 --> 1:13:26.971
What's wrong, Mr. Hunter?

1:13:28.975 --> 1:13:30.744
I'm so sorry
to have to tell you guys this,

1:13:30.779 --> 1:13:34.044
but Mario was killed
this morning.

1:13:37.522 --> 1:13:40.182
And this is Detective Burns
and Detective Hollister.

1:13:40.951 --> 1:13:43.559
They'd like to ask you guys
some questions about Mario,

1:13:43.594 --> 1:13:46.661
so if you could, please
just cooperate with them.

1:13:49.567 --> 1:13:52.161
Do any of you guys have
any information about anyone

1:13:52.196 --> 1:13:53.965
that might want to harm Mario?

1:13:54.200 --> 1:13:56.000
Do you know if he had problems
with anybody?

1:13:56.904 --> 1:13:58.233
Did he owe anyone money?

1:14:00.578 --> 1:14:02.171
We're here to try
to solve a murder,

1:14:02.773 --> 1:14:04.679
the murder of one
of your classmates.

1:14:05.415 --> 1:14:07.814
Don't you want to try to help us
find out who did this?

1:14:08.850 --> 1:14:12.049
Come on, kids.
They both just here to help.

1:14:14.053 --> 1:14:16.922
Who was the last one
in this class to talk to Mario?

1:14:19.597 --> 1:14:20.695
Come on, none of you?

1:14:21.664 --> 1:14:24.259
You're not helping us or Mario
by being quiet.

1:14:24.794 --> 1:14:27.031
If you cooperate
and you're scared,

1:14:27.700 --> 1:14:28.967
we can give you protection.

1:14:30.036 --> 1:14:31.134
Protection my ass.

1:14:31.169 --> 1:14:32.938
Y'all was not there
to protect Mario.

1:14:33.707 --> 1:14:36.678
We're just here to try to get
to the bottom of this, son.

1:14:40.046 --> 1:14:42.783
Mr. Hunter,
let me give you my card.

1:14:43.685 --> 1:14:46.721
And if any of your students
can remember anything,

1:14:47.323 --> 1:14:48.657
let me know as soon as possible.

1:14:49.693 --> 1:14:50.923
Okay, I will.

1:14:52.322 --> 1:14:53.761
Uh...

1:14:54.597 --> 1:14:56.665
Why don't we just head home
for the day, kids?

1:14:57.134 --> 1:14:58.634
I think that's best. Can we--

1:14:59.403 --> 1:15:00.933
Let's meet up here
at the school tomorrow

1:15:00.968 --> 1:15:02.264
and discuss
how everybody's feeling.

1:15:07.172 --> 1:15:08.941
-Okay. Thank you.
-Come on, come on.

1:15:08.976 --> 1:15:10.041
Thank you.

1:15:14.179 --> 1:15:15.211
Sorry, kids.

1:15:15.680 --> 1:15:16.949
I can't believe this.

1:15:17.518 --> 1:15:19.721
Yeah, I'mma catch up
with y'all, all right?

1:15:19.989 --> 1:15:21.624
-All right, man.
-See you, Elijah.

1:15:30.030 --> 1:15:33.262
-Slow down. Slow. Down.

1:15:33.297 --> 1:15:34.637
-Hey.

1:15:34.672 --> 1:15:35.737
Bye, Mr. Robinson.

1:15:36.806 --> 1:15:38.102
-Bye.
-Bye.

1:15:40.205 --> 1:15:42.304
All right, now. Bye!

1:15:44.110 --> 1:15:45.846
Cut it out! Stop!

1:15:45.881 --> 1:15:47.947
Hey, stop that!
What are y'all doing?

1:15:47.982 --> 1:15:49.113
Stop!

1:15:49.148 --> 1:15:50.279
Get on over here. Go home.

1:15:53.284 --> 1:15:55.790
Kayla. Hey, baby,
you got so big!

1:15:56.058 --> 1:15:57.792
I'm Casey,
I'm a friend of your dad.

1:15:57.827 --> 1:15:58.991
He asked me to come get you

1:15:59.026 --> 1:16:00.157
'cause he got into an accident

1:16:00.192 --> 1:16:01.763
to take you
to see your grandmother.

1:16:01.798 --> 1:16:02.929
Accident?

1:16:02.964 --> 1:16:04.667
Oh, no, no, no. He'll be fine.

1:16:04.702 --> 1:16:07.065
Matter of fact, he's gonna meet
us there as soon as possible.

1:16:07.100 --> 1:16:09.232
Let's go see your grandmother.
Come on.

1:16:13.744 --> 1:16:14.776
It's about Mario.

1:16:16.813 --> 1:16:19.913
Okay. Um, is there something
I should know about Mario

1:16:19.948 --> 1:16:21.882
that you didn't want
to tell the detectives?

1:16:24.282 --> 1:16:25.754
I think I know
what happened to him.

1:16:26.955 --> 1:16:28.020
What, Elijah?

1:16:29.353 --> 1:16:31.826
The other night, he went
to see Trey about a job.

1:16:33.027 --> 1:16:36.358
Trey? A job? What kind of job?

1:16:36.393 --> 1:16:37.865
You know, a job.

1:16:37.900 --> 1:16:39.702
He was robbing houses
and businesses.

1:16:40.404 --> 1:16:42.199
That's why he always
had money in his pocket.

1:16:44.071 --> 1:16:45.136
And you think...

1:16:45.872 --> 1:16:48.007
What? he was so deep in it
with Trey,

1:16:48.042 --> 1:16:49.140
and that's what got him killed?

1:16:49.175 --> 1:16:50.812
Man, Mr. Hunter, I don't know.

1:16:52.079 --> 1:16:53.980
There's a lot going through
my mind right now.

1:16:54.415 --> 1:16:56.884
Hey, you gotta tell me
everything you know.

1:17:01.891 --> 1:17:03.352
He was dealing
with that crooked-ass cop.

1:17:04.289 --> 1:17:05.728
What crooked-ass cop?

1:17:05.763 --> 1:17:07.224
You know,
the one that runs this program.

1:17:08.865 --> 1:17:12.933
What? W-- Wait a minute,
the music program?

1:17:13.669 --> 1:17:15.738
I thought Mrs. Clark
ran this program?

1:17:16.073 --> 1:17:19.170
She do,
but she's not the real boss.

1:17:21.944 --> 1:17:25.781
Elijah, who is this cop
you're talking about?

1:17:28.214 --> 1:17:29.719
Detective Frank Mazzetti.

1:17:30.154 --> 1:17:32.414
Detective Frank Mazzett--

1:17:35.826 --> 1:17:39.795
Wait a minute. I know him.

1:17:39.830 --> 1:17:42.358
Yeah, well, he had Mario go out
and do jobs for him too.

1:17:42.593 --> 1:17:44.228
He was getting him
pills and shit.

1:17:48.531 --> 1:17:52.203
Elijah, why don't you
head on home and, uh,

1:17:54.075 --> 1:17:55.338
we'll talk about this
in the morning.

1:17:57.375 --> 1:18:00.277
And Elijah, let me
worry about everything

1:18:00.312 --> 1:18:01.718
you just told me, aight?

1:18:02.347 --> 1:18:03.379
All right, Mr. Hunter.

1:18:19.133 --> 1:18:20.429
Fucker!

1:18:49.867 --> 1:18:51.526
<i>This is Gabriel Cavallero.</i>

1:18:51.895 --> 1:18:53.836
<i>If anything happens to me,</i>

1:18:53.871 --> 1:18:55.431
<i>Detective Frank Mazzetti</i>
<i>did it.</i>

1:18:55.733 --> 1:18:57.367
<i>I found out he was embezzling</i>

1:18:57.402 --> 1:18:59.204
<i>the music program's</i>
<i>grant money.</i>

1:18:59.573 --> 1:19:02.009
<i>Tell my uncle, Maxim Cavallero.</i>

1:19:02.277 --> 1:19:03.945
<i>You can find him</i>
<i>at his warehouse</i>

1:19:03.980 --> 1:19:06.211
<i>on Industrial Boulevard,</i>
<i>near the docks.</i>

1:19:06.246 --> 1:19:08.950
Oh, shit.

1:19:21.360 --> 1:19:22.832
-<i> Hello?</i>
-Hey, Carlos.

1:19:22.867 --> 1:19:24.064

What that got to do with me?
How is that my problem?

1:24:16.424 --> 1:24:18.226

nothing to happen to her, right?

1:24:22.127 --> 1:24:24.133

You just gon' do me

I didn't call you.

1:27:20.806 --> 1:27:22.278
Doing my job, Max.

1:27:24.348 --> 1:27:25.479
Where's my daughter?

1:27:29.111 --> 1:27:31.683
Don't worry. She's close.

1:27:37.526 --> 1:27:39.328

1:27:40.122 --> 1:27:41.561
You said fuck Max, right?

Frank killed Gabriel?

1:27:50.440 --> 1:27:51.505
What?

1:27:52.409 --> 1:27:54.574
Yeah, and I got proof!

1:27:54.842 --> 1:27:56.477
You motherfucking Frank.

1:27:57.046 --> 1:27:58.611
Fucking 'em! Kill 'em all!

1:28:24.474 --> 1:28:26.001
No. No, no.

1:28:26.036 --> 1:28:28.443
Sorry. Time's up.

1:28:33.477 --> 1:28:35.109
Not today, motherfucker.

1:28:35.578 --> 1:28:37.551
-Uncle Trey!
-I gotcha, Kayla.

1:28:40.457 --> 1:28:41.522
B, come on!

1:28:41.957 --> 1:28:44.459
-Buddha, get her out of here.
-Come on, Kayla.

1:28:46.023 --> 1:28:47.055
Come on, y'all.

1:28:55.802 --> 1:28:57.472
Oh, fuck.

1:28:57.507 --> 1:29:00.904
I accept your apology,
and don't worry, Kayla's safe.

1:29:00.939 --> 1:29:05.106
Oh, fuck. Thanks, man.
I appreciate that.

1:29:05.141 --> 1:29:07.614
Don't worry about it.
Thank me later.

1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:37.677
You fucked me, Kev!

1:29:39.549 --> 1:29:42.077
Nah! You was trying
to fuck me, Frank.

1:29:42.879 --> 1:29:46.851
I can cover for us,
but we have to make a deal.

1:29:48.085 --> 1:29:49.150
A deal?

1:29:49.955 --> 1:29:51.119
Man, what kind of deal?

1:29:51.990 --> 1:29:53.187
How can I trust you?

1:29:53.622 --> 1:29:55.959
You don't have a choice
but to trust me.

1:30:01.835 --> 1:30:03.901
All right. I'm coming out.

1:30:06.268 --> 1:30:08.774
Trey, I need you
to do something.

1:30:09.042 --> 1:30:10.105
What you need?

1:30:13.649 --> 1:30:15.979
All right. Coming out.

1:30:26.794 --> 1:30:30.059
I can clear this up,
but we have to become partners.

1:30:30.861 --> 1:30:32.765
We can both benefit
from the box.

1:30:34.637 --> 1:30:38.034
Well, if we gon' be partners,
then I want in on everything.

1:30:39.169 --> 1:30:40.575
What do you mean everything?

1:30:41.941 --> 1:30:43.171
That is everything.

1:30:43.640 --> 1:30:44.909
What else is there?

1:30:45.578 --> 1:30:47.912
I want in on that 400,000
that you gettin'.

1:30:53.018 --> 1:30:54.787
I'll give you a hundred grand.

1:30:54.822 --> 1:30:58.824
Nah, Half. No deal, Frank.

1:31:05.327 --> 1:31:06.601
Deal.

1:31:16.305 --> 1:31:17.975
Why'd you kill
Gabriel Cavallero?

1:31:21.717 --> 1:31:26.555
Aw, man. He found out what
I was doing, threatened to tell,

1:31:28.724 --> 1:31:29.723
so I blew his head off.

1:31:30.253 --> 1:31:31.527
Pretty simple.

1:31:33.729 --> 1:31:35.828
All right, look, listen.

1:31:36.230 --> 1:31:38.160
I'mma take care of them
out there, all right?

1:31:39.196 --> 1:31:41.163
-I think they'll trust me.
-Yeah.

1:31:42.166 --> 1:31:43.297
You guys hold tight.

1:31:45.367 --> 1:31:47.268
We'll figure this out,
all right? Sound good?

1:31:47.770 --> 1:31:49.941
-S'all good.

1:31:50.443 --> 1:31:52.977
Come out the building
with your hands up.

1:31:55.916 --> 1:31:58.884
Carlos, did you get all that?

1:31:59.183 --> 1:32:00.215
Yup.

1:32:00.550 --> 1:32:01.821
<i>I got it.</i>

1:32:03.693 --> 1:32:05.319
And I tagged the police
like you asked me to.

1:32:13.637 --> 1:32:15.362
Hey! Detective Frank Mizzetti,

1:32:15.397 --> 1:32:17.034
everything's under control here.

1:32:17.069 --> 1:32:18.871

1:32:23.647 --> 1:32:25.009
Put the gun down, Frank!

1:32:25.244 --> 1:32:27.649
It ain't worth it, Frank.
We know what you did.

1:32:29.279 --> 1:32:30.685
Thanks, Trey.

1:32:30.720 --> 1:32:32.819
Let's get the fuck up
out of here, man.

1:32:36.891 --> 1:32:37.956
Come on, Frank.

1:32:38.191 --> 1:32:39.694
Don't have to end this way!

1:32:46.835 --> 1:32:48.131
Don't be stupid!

1:32:49.167 --> 1:32:50.672
Put the gun down, Frank.

1:32:51.367 --> 1:32:52.938
-No!

1:32:54.843 --> 1:32:56.271
Put the gun down!

1:33:14.995 --> 1:33:17.391
Trey, man, I gotta thank you
for coming through for me, bruh.

1:33:17.926 --> 1:33:20.064
Don't pat yourself
on the back, Kev.

1:33:20.099 --> 1:33:21.197
I did that for Kayla.

1:33:21.432 --> 1:33:22.737
Wait, wait, wait.

1:33:23.806 --> 1:33:24.838
I got to ask, man.

1:33:25.373 --> 1:33:27.137
What did I do to you
back in the day

1:33:27.172 --> 1:33:29.172
so bad that I needed
to be sorry for, man?

1:33:31.946 --> 1:33:33.176
You still don't know, huh, Kev?

1:33:33.611 --> 1:33:35.079
Nah, man, I don't know.

1:33:35.848 --> 1:33:37.884
When we was
in the ninth grade,

1:33:37.919 --> 1:33:40.315
you stole Michelle from me
when I went to juvie.

1:33:40.350 --> 1:33:42.053
Man, you knew
I was in love with her.

1:33:42.288 --> 1:33:44.253
Wow.

1:33:44.288 --> 1:33:46.222
Man, I'm sensitive.

1:33:46.257 --> 1:33:47.828
I was in the ninth grade, man.

1:33:47.863 --> 1:33:48.994
Really?

1:33:49.029 --> 1:33:50.732
But you still my boy, man.

1:33:51.101 --> 1:33:52.261
You're sensitive?

1:33:52.296 --> 1:33:55.198
