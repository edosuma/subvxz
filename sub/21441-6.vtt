MILES: <i>Previously on</i> Get Shorty...

00:10.464 --> 00:12.458
Sad excuse for a half-assed writer.

00:12.464 --> 00:15.458
Let me handle it. Okay?

00:15.464 --> 00:19.458
I'll make sure he does what you
want. And I'm a little curious.

00:19.464 --> 00:20.459
About what?

00:20.465 --> 00:22.458
About how the writing thing works.

00:22.464 --> 00:23.459
Help!

(SCREAMING)

00:25.464 --> 00:27.458
You talk to Mexico?

00:27.464 --> 00:29.458
They wanna keep business smooth.

00:29.464 --> 00:31.458
But you got the Feds watching you.

00:31.464 --> 00:32.459
So?

00:32.465 --> 00:35.458
I'll handle the territory
north of Indian Springs.

00:35.464 --> 00:37.458
It's best for everyone.

00:37.464 --> 00:41.458
Josias's men. They talk to you?

00:41.464 --> 00:43.458
They said shit. I didn't listen.

00:56.464 --> 00:58.458

DHAR: Take it you were
asleep when this happened.

01:40.464 --> 01:42.458
Josias was second from the right.

01:42.464 --> 01:45.458
Chatter suggested he was gonna
move on Amara De Escalones,

01:45.464 --> 01:48.464
so maybe this is her
getting to him first.

01:49.464 --> 01:51.458

02:09.464 --> 02:12.464
- Oh. Impressive hosting.
- Good morning.

02:13.464 --> 02:15.458
I'm sure you agree.

02:15.464 --> 02:19.458
It's, um, it's better if Emma
doesn't know about last night.

02:19.464 --> 02:21.458
Did something happen last night?

02:21.464 --> 02:24.458
(SCOFFS) Well, you don't
remember. That's your loss.

02:24.464 --> 02:27.464
- Oh, you mean the sex?
- Mmm.

02:28.464 --> 02:29.459
I mean, as a rule,

02:29.465 --> 02:31.458
I don't usually tell
Emma when we have sex.

02:31.464 --> 02:33.458
Do you do that?

02:33.464 --> 02:35.458
No. I mean, only when it's really good.

doing the, you know,

when you come into the office.

03:09.464 --> 03:10.459
Yeah, definitely.

03:10.465 --> 03:12.458
Also, you're gonna meet the director,

03:12.464 --> 03:13.459
and the lovely lady
from Gravity Pictures.

want to get in the way.

have a problem with it,

03:57.464 --> 03:59.458
<i>Well, uh, sober enough.</i>

03:59.464 --> 04:01.458
Then you made a decision.

04:01.464 --> 04:03.464
Well, I mean, I wouldn't
call it a decision. We just...

04:04.464 --> 04:06.464
(SIGHS) I'm sorry.

toxic about this situation.

07:47.464 --> 07:49.458
But everyone in there...

07:49.464 --> 07:52.458
Every... Everyone, I mean,
everyone is writing a screenplay.

07:52.464 --> 07:55.458
So, I mean, do writers just
work in coffee shops or...

07:55.464 --> 07:57.458
Is everyone in LA a fuckin' writer?

07:57.464 --> 07:58.464
MILES: Hey.

07:59.464 --> 08:01.458
She is? That's great.

08:01.464 --> 08:03.458
I mean, of course she
is, it's a beautiful role.

08:03.464 --> 08:05.458
I can get her a meeting
but she'll have to be quick,

08:05.464 --> 08:08.458
there's an awful lot of interest.

08:08.464 --> 08:12.458
Okay, well, let me find the time
and I'll call you back later.

08:12.464 --> 08:13.459
- Did you hear that?
- Hmm?

08:13.465 --> 08:16.458
That is textbook. Sell the
sizzle and not the steak.

08:16.464 --> 08:18.464
Well, my sizzle got sold.

08:20.464 --> 08:23.458
- Where is Hafdis?
- GLADYS: I don't know.

08:23.464 --> 08:24.459
- He was just there...
- What do you got?

08:24.465 --> 08:26.458
GLADYS: On a scout.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.458
Rick. Becca Morgan, she's
interested in the role of Margaret.

08:29.537 --> 08:31.458
Okay, well, well, who's that?

08:31.464 --> 08:33.457
Could you get April Quinn on the line?

08:33.464 --> 08:35.014
Also, can I get one
of those headset things

08:35.020 --> 08:36.457
for my phone, like that lady has, there?

08:36.464 --> 08:39.457
Becca Morgan, she was a breakout
role in <i> Flashing Lights.</i>

08:39.464 --> 08:41.457
RICK: Which is?

08:41.464 --> 08:43.457
A film out of New Zealand,
winning loads of awards.

08:43.464 --> 08:45.458
- According to who?
- Her agent.

08:45.464 --> 08:47.458
Ah. Now, see. You gotta watch out.

08:47.464 --> 08:48.459
That's what the agents do. They talk...

08:48.465 --> 08:50.458
GLADYS: I have April.

08:50.464 --> 08:51.464
Oh, all right. Put her on speaker.

08:54.464 --> 08:56.458
- Hello, Miss Quinn.
- APRIL: <i>This about Becca Morgan?</i>

08:56.464 --> 08:58.458
- You heard.
- Unbelievable.

08:58.464 --> 09:00.458
Kisbye, now Morgan.

09:00.464 --> 09:02.015
I don't know what they
see in this project

09:02.022 --> 09:03.458
or why they'd want to work with you.

09:03.464 --> 09:05.458
But it's a good cast.

09:05.464 --> 09:06.459
Brandon likes her?

09:06.465 --> 09:08.458
APRIL: <i>He saw</i> Flashing
Lights <i> at Telluride,</i>

09:08.464 --> 09:10.458
<i>he's been killing himself
trying to put her in something.</i>

09:10.464 --> 09:13.458
Yeah, she was great
in that. We love her.

09:13.464 --> 09:14.459
Becca wants to come in
and discuss the role.

09:14.465 --> 09:16.458
I was thinking we could
use that big white room

09:16.464 --> 09:20.458
that you brought us to, the
one with the... With the trees.

09:20.464 --> 09:22.458
Make sure Hafdis can come.

09:22.464 --> 09:24.458
Yeah. And, uh, Julian Pynter.
She's gonna want to meet the writer.

09:24.464 --> 09:26.458
- APRIL: <i> No, he quit.</i>
- What?

09:26.464 --> 09:29.458
APRIL: <i>Yeah. Stopped
returning calls, really weird.</i>

09:29.464 --> 09:32.464
<i>But don't bring Louis
Darnell. He's a train wreck.</i>

09:33.464 --> 09:35.458
Yeah, no problem.

09:35.464 --> 09:36.459
- How's 1:00 pm?
- How's it look?

09:36.465 --> 09:38.458
Yeah, should be good.

09:38.464 --> 09:40.458
Line producer interview is at 10:00
and the investor comes in a noon.

09:40.464 --> 09:43.464
- What investor?
- Amara De Escalones.

09:46.464 --> 09:48.464
- Amara's coming where?
- Here.

09:49.464 --> 09:51.458
To this office?

09:51.464 --> 09:52.459
Yeah, yeah, yeah. She called last night.

09:52.465 --> 09:54.464
Said she's coming by this
afternoon. I thought you knew that.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.464
Hello?

09:59.464 --> 10:01.458
You know, 1:00 pm, great.

APRIL: <i>All righty, then.
Brandon's gonna be ecstatic.</i>

10:04.464 --> 10:05.464
Could we step into your office?

10:13.464 --> 10:16.464
She called me. I didn't call her, so...

10:17.464 --> 10:20.458
Talked about the project, that's all.

10:20.464 --> 10:21.459
Our project. It's not like I said,

10:21.465 --> 10:23.458
"Hey, come to LA."

10:23.464 --> 10:26.458
Why didn't we hear about it till now?

10:26.464 --> 10:28.464
I didn't know myself till last night.

10:32.464 --> 10:34.458
Get a hold of Ed, find
out why they're here.

10:34.464 --> 10:37.458
Oh, shit. I better
tell Katie not to come.

10:37.464 --> 10:39.458
LOUIS: What are you gonna tell her?

10:39.464 --> 10:40.464
MILES: I don't know. I'll
text her something vague.

10:42.464 --> 10:44.458
All right. I know, I know the
rough stuff happened in Nevada.

10:44.464 --> 10:47.458
The stuff with your
face. And okay, that's...

10:47.464 --> 10:49.458
It's unacceptable.

10:49.464 --> 10:52.458
But she's not gonna try that
stuff outside the casino, right?

10:52.464 --> 10:54.458
It's... This is what investors do.

10:54.464 --> 10:57.458
They want the glitz and the glamour.

10:57.464 --> 10:59.458
She picks up a souvenir, she goes home.

10:59.464 --> 11:01.464
You don't want her picking up souvenirs.

11:03.464 --> 11:04.464
What does that mean?

11:05.464 --> 11:07.464
Ed's not answering.

11:08.464 --> 11:10.458
(LOUIS SIGHS)

11:10.464 --> 11:11.459
You're not gonna be available
to meet Becca Morgan today.

11:11.465 --> 11:13.458
Why's that?

11:13.464 --> 11:14.835
You're gonna be too busy showing Amara

11:14.842 --> 11:16.458
the beautiful sights of Los Angeles.

11:16.464 --> 11:17.459
Like, uh, the Chinese Mann Theatre.

11:17.465 --> 11:19.458
- MILES: The Hollywood sign.
- LOUIS: Or the wax museum.

11:19.464 --> 11:23.464
Whatever it takes to get her fill,
so she can drive back to Pahrump.

11:24.464 --> 11:26.464
I don't know why this is on me.

11:28.464 --> 11:31.464
But fine, I'll deal with her.

11:36.464 --> 11:38.464
Just want to point out,
she's your investor.

11:42.464 --> 11:45.458
Should we use the round
table for the appetizers?

11:45.464 --> 11:47.458
No, I know, we'll set
out stuff for the bar.

11:51.465 --> 11:53.458
I thought you were in the guest house

11:53.464 --> 11:55.458
but then Jenna said,
"No one's in there."

11:55.464 --> 11:58.094
- Oh, we stayed at my dad's.
- Okay.

11:58.190 --> 11:59.458
We're going to visit
Miles at the studio.

11:59.464 --> 12:01.458
But I will be back to help
you get ready for the party.

12:01.464 --> 12:04.464
- All right. Get changed, we'll go.
- Yes!

12:06.464 --> 12:08.464

- Yeah.

12:09.464 --> 12:10.464
Just sleep?

12:12.464 --> 12:13.464
Not just sleep.

12:15.464 --> 12:17.458

It's like an addiction. I don't know.

12:26.464 --> 12:29.458
- Want to invite him tonight?
- No, no, bad idea.

12:29.464 --> 12:30.464
You sure?

12:31.464 --> 12:35.458
Look. It's Indian Springs.

12:35.464 --> 12:36.459
CHARLENE: (SIGHS) I saw that.

12:36.465 --> 12:39.169

12:45.464 --> 12:46.464
How long they been on us?

12:49.464 --> 12:53.464

CLANCY: Sir, in order for me to let you

13:35.878 --> 13:37.458

to let you on with a warrant,

13:41.464 --> 13:43.458
or if you're coordinating with the
police department on the studio lot.

13:43.464 --> 13:47.464
Otherwise, you're gonna want to make
a U-turn and use that exit. Thanks.

20:14.464 --> 20:16.458
No, I get it.

20:16.464 --> 20:17.459
Hey, hold on.

20:17.465 --> 20:21.458
Could you meet me tonight
before the party? Just you.

20:21.464 --> 20:24.464
- Well, I'm... I'm helping Charlene.
- Five minutes.

20:25.464 --> 20:27.458
For what?

20:27.464 --> 20:29.464
I'll text you the
address. It's a surprise.

20:33.464 --> 20:36.458
Well, thank you for the VIP tour.

20:36.464 --> 20:38.458
TOUR GUIDE: All right folks,
welcome to the Gravity Studio's tour!

20:38.464 --> 20:41.464
(SIGHS) It ain't pretty.

20:45.464 --> 20:47.458
MILES: Let's hear it.

20:47.464 --> 20:51.458
Ed said that they took out
Josias Ramos and his crew.

20:51.464 --> 20:53.464
His crew. How many men?

20:54.464 --> 20:55.464
Dozen.

20:57.464 --> 20:58.459
Holy shit.

20:58.465 --> 21:00.458
LOUIS: So, Amara split
Nevada before it went down,

21:00.464 --> 21:03.458
she decided this is as
good a place to go as any.

21:03.464 --> 21:06.458
And then Yago came up to join her.

21:06.464 --> 21:08.458
So she'll have Feds watching.

21:08.464 --> 21:10.458
Safe bet.

21:10.464 --> 21:12.458
Which means they'll be watching us too.

21:12.464 --> 21:15.458
Holy shit.

21:15.464 --> 21:16.459
Everything was peachy and
she brings the circus to town.

21:16.465 --> 21:19.464
Be careful, she might hear us. Just...

21:24.464 --> 21:26.464
- The fuck?
- LOUIS: What?

21:27.464 --> 21:28.459
Nothing, just...

21:28.465 --> 21:31.464
This memo. It says I missed
a call from your agent.

21:32.464 --> 21:33.458
(CHUCKLES)

21:33.464 --> 21:34.464
He might have called.

21:36.464 --> 21:38.458
- Your agent?
- Yeah.

21:38.464 --> 21:39.464
You have an agent.

21:40.464 --> 21:43.458
Matt Solo. Yeah, I met him at church.

21:43.464 --> 21:45.464
- Did you?
- LOUIS: Mmm-hmm.

21:46.464 --> 21:48.458
Why's he calling me?

21:48.464 --> 21:51.458
I'm not totally sure but could be
to discuss my fee for the screenplay.

21:51.464 --> 21:55.458
Your fee... That you didn't write.

21:55.464 --> 21:56.464
We know that.

21:57.464 --> 21:58.459
Just to be clear.

21:58.465 --> 22:00.458
We may be implicated in a mass murder

22:00.464 --> 22:02.458
and you're trying to gouge
me for fuckin' script money?

22:02.464 --> 22:05.458
He said that the
studio would pay for it.

22:05.464 --> 22:06.464
- Oh, shit.
- Oh, they're leaving.

22:08.464 --> 22:11.458
So, Rick's taking you
to see the sights, is he?

22:11.464 --> 22:13.458
Yeah. Can't go wrong with
the Walk of Fame, right?

22:13.464 --> 22:16.458
- MILES: No.
- It's a side-walk with names. (CHUCKLES)

22:16.464 --> 22:17.458
I wish we could come.

22:17.464 --> 22:18.464
Uh, send some pictures.

22:19.464 --> 22:21.464
Hmm. Let's go.

22:23.464 --> 22:25.458
Good luck with that actress,
huh? Crossed fingers.

22:25.464 --> 22:28.458
Who? What actress?

22:28.464 --> 22:29.459
RICK: No. I've never even heard of her.

22:29.465 --> 22:32.464
(STAMMERS) I'm not even going.
I'm gonna let Miles handle it.

22:33.464 --> 22:34.459
You meet here?

22:34.465 --> 22:37.458
Oh, no, no. Way over at the studio.

22:37.464 --> 22:40.458
We've got so many actor
meetings coming up, don't we?

22:40.464 --> 22:42.458
I mean, if down the line you want
to sit in on one, that would be...

22:42.464 --> 22:43.464
I come to this one.

22:46.464 --> 22:47.464
There's really no need.

22:48.464 --> 22:52.458
You don't want me to go? But you go.

22:52.464 --> 22:55.464
(CHUCKLES) I have to. It's my job.

22:56.464 --> 22:58.464
Your job is what I say it is.

23:01.464 --> 23:02.464
The more the merrier.

23:04.464 --> 23:05.464
Good idea.

23:14.464 --> 23:17.458
Ed called. Amara wants me in Nevada.

23:17.464 --> 23:20.458
No, there's no way you're going
down there and I'm staying here.

23:20.464 --> 23:23.458
We were supposed to get
an update two hours ago.

23:23.464 --> 23:25.458
My ass hurts from sitting
in this fucking chair.

23:25.464 --> 23:27.458
It'll come by.

23:27.464 --> 23:29.458
All right, he said to keep an eye
on Lyle. Just don't let him die.

23:29.464 --> 23:30.459
Ed can go fuck himself.

23:30.465 --> 23:32.458
Change the IV every six hours.

23:32.464 --> 23:34.458
If the EPI stops workin', give
Ed a call, he'll get a doctor.

23:34.464 --> 23:35.213
Fuck!

23:35.220 --> 23:37.458
All right, microwave
there. Soup and tortillas.

23:37.464 --> 23:40.458
Yeah, yeah, that's great.

23:40.464 --> 23:43.392
Thank you. It's like
Nevada fuckin' correctional.

Yo.

24:27.464 --> 24:28.464
Hey.

24:29.464 --> 24:32.458
Hey. Wake the fuck up.

(LYLE GROANS)

24:40.464 --> 24:41.464
Fuck!

24:42.464 --> 24:45.458
I take this tiny movie
out of New Zealand,

24:45.464 --> 24:47.458
I mean, it paid nothing
but I liked the script.

24:47.464 --> 24:49.458
Next thing I know, it's winning awards

24:49.464 --> 24:51.196
and I'm having a meeting with Hafdis

24:51.203 --> 24:53.458
Snaebjornsson about
an amazing new project.

24:53.464 --> 24:54.262
(APRIL CHUCKLES)

24:54.269 --> 24:56.458
Well, we're just lucky to have you here.

24:56.464 --> 24:57.459
Mmm-hmm. Right.

24:57.465 --> 25:00.458
I watched your film on
a flight to Reykjavik.

25:00.464 --> 25:03.464
Your performance was
absolutely stunning.

25:04.464 --> 25:07.458
It was haunting in its honesty.

25:07.464 --> 25:09.458
Mmm. I thought so.

25:09.464 --> 25:11.458
- That's very kind.
- APRIL: Mmm.

25:11.464 --> 25:13.458
And congratulations on the reviews.

25:13.464 --> 25:17.464
Thank you. What happened to your face?

25:18.464 --> 25:20.458
Slipped on a squash court.

25:20.464 --> 25:23.458
BECCA: Oh. Hmm.

25:23.464 --> 25:25.458
What's the movie called?

25:25.464 --> 25:27.458
That I did? <i> Flashing Lights.</i>

25:27.464 --> 25:29.464
Eh, I didn't see.

25:30.464 --> 25:32.458
He say you play prostitute.

25:32.464 --> 25:33.464
Yeah.

25:39.464 --> 25:41.458
You lived in New Zealand, right?

25:41.464 --> 25:42.943
Right. Still catch myself driving on the

25:42.950 --> 25:44.458
left side, now and then. (CHUCKLES)

25:44.464 --> 25:46.458
(ALL CHUCKLE)

25:46.464 --> 25:49.458
BECCA: I learned so much, living
there. About New Zealand, but also...

25:49.464 --> 25:51.464
She don't look like Margaret.

25:52.464 --> 25:54.458
(MILES GULPS)

25:54.464 --> 25:55.464
AMARA: You wanna play Margaret, right?

25:56.464 --> 25:58.464
But you don't look right.

26:01.464 --> 26:04.458
And that's what's so
amazing about actors, innit?

26:04.464 --> 26:06.458
- How they can transform themselves.
- RICK: Yeah...

26:06.464 --> 26:08.458
Mmm-hmm. (GASPS) Sorry, I should go.

26:08.464 --> 26:10.552
I'm, um, I'm meeting
friends of mine tonight,

26:10.559 --> 26:12.458
who own an organic
winery in New Zealand.

26:12.464 --> 26:15.458
You should come, if you want
and we can talk about the movie?

26:15.464 --> 26:17.458
- Sounds nice.
- BECCA: My agent has my number.

26:17.464 --> 26:18.463
(APRIL CHUCKLES)

26:18.470 --> 26:21.458
Oh, um, does this mean
you're gonna take the role?

26:21.464 --> 26:23.458
I'm definitely interested.

26:23.464 --> 26:25.458
- So exciting!
- BECCA: Lovely to meet you all.

26:25.464 --> 26:26.459
RICK: Yeah, you too.

26:26.465 --> 26:28.458
- Becca, I'll see you out.
- BECCA: Okay.

26:28.464 --> 26:30.464
- HAFDIS: Okay.
- MILES: Cheers.

26:33.464 --> 26:35.464
HAFDIS: Thank you.

26:36.464 --> 26:38.458
- Mmm-hmm.
- Sounds like we got our Margaret.

26:38.464 --> 26:40.458
- RICK: Yeah.
- APRIL: It's a huge get.

26:40.464 --> 26:42.458
Brandon will be over
the moon when he hears.

26:42.464 --> 26:44.464
- Oh, yeah. This'll be good.
- We find someone else.

26:48.464 --> 26:50.458
I think she's perfect.

26:50.464 --> 26:53.458
No. She, she has the
dignity I envisioned

26:53.464 --> 26:56.458
and the quality of someone
who knows suffering.

26:56.464 --> 26:58.464
No, no, no. Someone else.

27:02.464 --> 27:04.458
Amara, right?

27:04.464 --> 27:07.458
I told Rick I was happy to
have you join for this meeting.

27:07.464 --> 27:09.458
But this studio also
has a stake in this film.

27:09.464 --> 27:11.458
A very large stake.

27:11.464 --> 27:13.464
So this just really isn't your call.

27:16.464 --> 27:17.464
(EXHALES)

27:20.464 --> 27:22.464
I just tell you what I see.

27:23.464 --> 27:24.464
And we appreciate that.

27:32.464 --> 27:33.459
- I came here in a golf cart.
- Ah.

27:33.465 --> 27:35.458
- Anyone needs a ride?
- Oh.

27:35.464 --> 27:37.458
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

27:37.464 --> 27:38.464
RICK: Yeah.

27:41.464 --> 27:44.458
Tonight we go to dinner.
Where we gonna go?

27:44.464 --> 27:47.458
Oh. You know what? I
can't do dinner tonight.

27:47.464 --> 27:50.458
I've got too much work on
of a productorial nature,

27:50.464 --> 27:54.458
maybe Rick will take you
to the Bel-Air Lounge.

27:54.464 --> 27:55.459
You're gonna love this place.

27:55.465 --> 27:58.464
Got loads of Hollywood
history and celebrities.

27:59.464 --> 28:01.464
Yeah, okay. (CHUCKLES)

28:02.464 --> 28:04.458
But you're too busy?

28:04.464 --> 28:06.458
I'm afraid so.

28:06.464 --> 28:09.464
'Cause you're a movie producer. I see.

28:14.464 --> 28:19.458
Feds, huh? What makes
you think they were Feds?

28:19.464 --> 28:21.458
ED: What do you mean?

28:21.464 --> 28:24.464
Well, you said they were in
the car behind you at the gate.

28:25.464 --> 28:27.458
Don't know if they were Feds.

28:27.464 --> 28:29.464
Just know that they were tailing us.

29:17.464 --> 29:22.458
Emma asked where I was going and
I said, "Your dad won't tell me."

29:22.464 --> 29:26.464
She wanted to come and I said she
couldn't, even though I don't why...

29:28.464 --> 29:31.464
- Is your hair different?
- Balayage.

29:32.464 --> 29:33.459
What now?

29:33.465 --> 29:36.458
It's fancy highlights. I
had it done at Charlene's.

29:36.464 --> 29:37.459
Don't ask what it cost.

29:37.465 --> 29:40.464
- It looks beautiful.
- Thank you. (SIGHS)

29:43.464 --> 29:45.464
You wanna, maybe tell me why we're here?

29:47.464 --> 29:48.464
You like this place?

29:49.464 --> 29:51.458
Who lives here?

29:51.464 --> 29:52.464
You, maybe.

29:54.464 --> 29:56.458
I didn't buy it, I just... I rented it.

29:56.464 --> 29:58.464
But if you come to
LA we could stay here.

29:59.464 --> 30:01.458
Miles.

30:01.464 --> 30:03.458
I had to give 'em
three months in advance.

30:03.464 --> 30:05.464
But don't let that influence you.

30:06.464 --> 30:08.464
Come on, have a look inside.

Okay.

tiles in the master bath."

30:26.464 --> 30:28.464
It's got three bed,

30:29.464 --> 30:31.458
in case Emma insists on living with us.

30:31.464 --> 30:33.464
What if I say no?

30:34.464 --> 30:36.458
It's fine.

30:36.464 --> 30:39.918
I'll have to burn the place
to the ground. But it's fine.

30:42.464 --> 30:44.464
It's a beautiful house.

30:45.464 --> 30:46.459
(SIGHS) It's perfect.

30:46.465 --> 30:49.464
But I, uh, I need a few
days to think about it.

30:50.464 --> 30:51.464
Sure.

30:52.464 --> 30:55.464

31:13.464 --> 31:15.458
You left him alone?

31:15.464 --> 31:16.459
I had to get some real food.

31:16.465 --> 31:19.458
I said if you needed
anything, to call me.

31:19.464 --> 31:21.464
It's not like he's going anywhere.

31:22.464 --> 31:24.464
You got the key?

(YAGO SIGHS)

31:41.464 --> 31:42.464
He keeps passing out.

31:52.464 --> 31:54.464
He's dead.

31:55.464 --> 31:57.464
No shit?

32:06.464 --> 32:10.458
What? I walked two blocks
so I can get a sub, okay?

32:10.464 --> 32:12.458
I was starving.

32:12.464 --> 32:13.459
I gotta call Amara.

32:13.465 --> 32:15.458
YAGO: You know what? Call Amara.

32:15.464 --> 32:17.556
Tell her I was sitting
here all day in this

32:17.563 --> 32:19.458
fucking garage that reeks of this <i> puta</i>.

32:19.464 --> 32:21.458
She said I would run the expansion.

32:21.464 --> 32:22.459
Not sit waiting all day,

32:22.465 --> 32:27.458
like some fuckin' secretary
for some phone calls.

32:27.464 --> 32:29.458
And you know what? And tell
her that if it wasn't for me,

32:29.464 --> 32:32.458
she wouldn't even have
had this new territory.

32:32.464 --> 32:33.981
You don't want me to tell her that.

32:36.464 --> 32:38.458
You know what?

32:38.464 --> 32:41.464
Get somebody else to clean this
shit, 'cause I'm fucking out of here.

go upstairs and watch T.V.

there's a party down here?

Uh, he's a, uh, a movie producer.

33:24.464 --> 33:26.458
Really?

33:26.464 --> 33:29.458
Yeah. He's making a film at
Gravity Pictures with Max Kisbye.

33:29.464 --> 33:34.458
- No kidding. I love Kisbye.
- (CHUCKLES) Yeah.

33:34.464 --> 33:37.458

there's a table read, and that's...

33:37.464 --> 33:39.458

you think they're stuck up.

46:36.464 --> 46:38.458
I mean, neither of us
in our wildest dreams

46:38.464 --> 46:41.458
thought that fucking
woman was coming to LA.

46:41.464 --> 46:43.458
Hi.

46:43.464 --> 46:45.458
Thought I'd surprise you.

46:45.464 --> 46:46.459
If I'm interrupting...

46:46.465 --> 46:49.458
No, no, no. Now's good.

46:49.464 --> 46:51.464
Come in. What is that?

46:53.464 --> 46:54.464
Tiki torch.

46:56.464 --> 46:59.458
-I'll be back in a few.
- No, don't leave on my account.

46:59.464 --> 47:01.464
Yes. Better if you leave.

47:07.464 --> 47:08.459
(SIGHS)

47:08.465 --> 47:10.458
It's been six months.

47:10.464 --> 47:13.458
Telling myself that, for
Emma's sake we had to move on.

47:13.464 --> 47:17.464
Because I couldn't imagine how our
situation was ever gonna change.

47:18.464 --> 47:20.458
Then I came out here.

47:20.464 --> 47:23.464
And I see this life
you're making for yourself,

47:24.464 --> 47:25.464
it's amazing.

47:27.464 --> 47:31.458
- And I find myself thinking...
- Katie, uh, we should talk.

47:31.464 --> 47:33.464
What do you mean?

47:34.464 --> 47:35.464
Let me close the door.

47:40.464 --> 47:42.458
'Sup, son? Makin' the
scene, living the dream?

47:42.464 --> 47:44.458
Yo, you need to get out here.

47:44.464 --> 47:47.458
- You would really like this.
- Seriously?

47:47.464 --> 47:49.458
YAGO: <i> Why not?</i>

47:49.464 --> 47:51.458
Boy, I'd love to get up there.

47:51.464 --> 47:52.459
I mean, I got cousins in Reseda.

47:52.465 --> 47:54.458
I used to get there as a kid...

47:54.464 --> 47:56.458
Hey, you still got that flake?

47:56.464 --> 47:58.458
<i>You should bring
that shit with you.</i>

47:58.464 --> 48:00.458
<i>We'll get a little
business going.</i>

48:00.464 --> 48:03.458
Think Amara's gonna roll with that?

48:03.464 --> 48:05.458
This shit is between you and me, right?

48:05.464 --> 48:06.459
<i>A little business on the side,</i>

48:06.465 --> 48:09.458
<i>Amara doesn't have
to hear about that.</i>

48:09.464 --> 48:13.458
I mean, if that's how
you want to play it.

48:13.464 --> 48:15.458
Well, then get your ass out here.

48:15.464 --> 48:18.464
Bring that fuckin' flake and
let's do Hollywood in style.

48:21.464 --> 48:23.458
Well, at least now I get it.

48:23.464 --> 48:26.464
How it's possible you could
suddenly be making a movie.

48:27.464 --> 48:29.458
(SIGHS)

48:29.464 --> 48:31.458
If Amara is behind it...

48:31.464 --> 48:34.458
Not behind it, just paying for it.

48:34.464 --> 48:37.458
So the movie comes out she'll
let you go on with your life?

48:37.464 --> 48:38.464
That's the plan.

48:40.464 --> 48:41.464
What did she actually say?

48:44.464 --> 48:47.458
- You haven't talked about it.
- No, we have.

48:47.464 --> 48:49.458
She's just invested in one movie.

48:49.464 --> 48:52.458
She agreed that I could
live here and honestly,

48:52.464 --> 48:56.458
I didn't know she was gonna stay
in LA until five bloody minutes ago.

48:56.464 --> 48:58.464
- Is she here, in the office?
- Yes.

49:06.464 --> 49:08.458
- Oh, Katie...
- I should go get Emma.

49:08.464 --> 49:10.458
We're driving back right after lunch.

49:10.464 --> 49:12.458
- Back to Nevada.
- Mmm.

49:12.464 --> 49:13.459
MILES: So is that it, then?

49:13.465 --> 49:16.458
'Cause if we're done,
can you just tell me?

49:16.464 --> 49:18.464
Put me out of my fuckin' misery.

49:19.464 --> 49:21.458
- I'll call you.
- Oh, okay.

49:21.464 --> 49:23.464
I don't mean it like that, I mean...

49:24.464 --> 49:26.464
I'll call you.

49:41.464 --> 49:42.459
What's that?

49:42.465 --> 49:45.458
I tried to balance coffee
and a stack of binders...

49:45.464 --> 49:48.458
And see? It's almost gone.

49:48.464 --> 49:49.464
- (CHUCKLES)
- That's handy.

49:50.464 --> 49:51.464
Is that ketchup?

49:53.464 --> 49:55.458
Yeah, yeah.

49:55.464 --> 49:57.464
- Hold still.
- Uh...

50:01.464 --> 50:05.464
You, uh, smell, um, nice.

50:12.464 --> 50:17.464
Well, there. I can still
see it, but it's better.

50:20.464 --> 50:21.464
Okay.

50:26.464 --> 50:27.464
Thank you.

50:31.464 --> 50:32.464
(INAUDIBLE)

50:54.464 --> 50:55.464
AGENT WARE: Mr. Snaebjornsson.

50:56.464 --> 50:58.458
HAFDIS: This is ridiculous.

50:58.464 --> 51:00.458
Then tell me what I've done.

51:00.464 --> 51:02.458
If you can't tell me,
you gotta let me go...

51:02.464 --> 51:03.459
Calm down. Sir, where's your car?

51:03.465 --> 51:06.464
- My what?
- Can you tell me where your car is?

51:07.464 --> 51:08.376
HAFDIS: My...

51:08.448 --> 51:09.967
DETECTIVE FADDEN: If
I told you it was in

51:09.974 --> 51:10.459
the swimming pool of the Wilshire Hotel,

51:10.465 --> 51:12.464
would you be surprised?

51:13.464 --> 51:14.459
Somewhat surprised, yeah.

51:14.465 --> 51:16.464
DETECTIVE FADDEN: You're going downtown.
