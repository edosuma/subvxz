00:11.280 --> 00:13.800
So, according to you,

00:14.520 --> 00:17.080
everything started
with the arrival of the new students.

00:24.680 --> 00:28.360
When a new species is introduced
into an ecosystem, it is always altered.

00:29.680 --> 00:32.720
<i>The new one can devastate</i>
<i>the flora and fauna of a place,</i>

00:33.520 --> 00:35.280
<i>breed endlessly,</i>

00:35.720 --> 00:39.560
<i>or cause more subtle changes</i>
<i>which end up perverting everything.</i>

00:40.600 --> 00:44.120
<i>Are you referring to the new students</i>
<i>as if they were another species?</i>

00:44.520 --> 00:48.720
I don't want to believe
that Marina's... dead.

00:49.040 --> 00:53.040
Nowadays, we use social networks
to present ourselves to others.

00:53.640 --> 00:56.720
What we show, or what we hide,

00:57.080 --> 00:59.080
says a lot about who we are.

00:59.480 --> 01:02.400
And this is what the pair work
I want you to do is about.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.040
I want you to create

01:04.240 --> 01:07.520
your partner's profile
for a social network.

01:07.600 --> 01:09.560
Wasn't this language
and literature class?

01:09.640 --> 01:11.320
Welcome to Las Encinas, man.

01:11.680 --> 01:15.880
We can demonize social networks,
like other schools do, but...

01:16.360 --> 01:19.080
we can also use them to learn.

01:19.240 --> 01:23.440
Please, take advantage of the opportunity
to investigate, to question each other.

01:23.520 --> 01:26.520
And most of all, adapt this to your goal.
What is it, Christian?

01:26.600 --> 01:29.800
I just have a question.
What can I improve in my profile? Nothing!

01:30.640 --> 01:31.800
It can be improved.

01:31.880 --> 01:34.240
When he was talking about privilege
and intelligence, he didn't mean you.

01:34.320 --> 01:35.840
Boom! Take that.

01:36.080 --> 01:36.920
Guys...

01:38.160 --> 01:39.680
Please, be creative.

01:39.760 --> 01:42.160
Use photos, videos, interviews,
whatever you want.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.920
You have all the school's resources
at your disposal.

01:47.640 --> 01:51.640
Nobody leaves until they have a partner.
Choose one and come by my desk.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.120
Here's your chance.

01:53.760 --> 01:54.600
To do what?

01:55.000 --> 01:58.200
What do you mean, "to do what"?
Our plan for Miss Palestine.

01:58.880 --> 02:01.240
Go and tell her you want to work with her.

02:02.320 --> 02:03.440
You are with me, right?

02:03.520 --> 02:06.480
That way, I'll get to see you more.
You've been avoiding me.

02:06.560 --> 02:09.360
What a silly thing to say.
Of course we'll work together.

02:09.440 --> 02:11.120
So, want to work together?

02:11.360 --> 02:13.640
You won't have much to do.
My profile rules.

02:13.720 --> 02:17.160
And once we upload some photos
of your trophies and the girls you get,

02:17.240 --> 02:19.840
yours will be done in no time.
Then we can smoke a joint.

02:19.920 --> 02:20.840
Shut up!

02:21.920 --> 02:22.840
Samuel.

02:23.400 --> 02:25.160
We can work together if you want.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.240
You and I?

02:27.400 --> 02:28.240
OK.

02:30.040 --> 02:31.200
Want to work together?

02:31.280 --> 02:33.360
-But we have nothing in common.
-Even better.

02:33.600 --> 02:35.440
We can learn more about each other.

02:40.520 --> 02:41.400
Motherfucker.

02:42.840 --> 02:46.560
-Nano, are those burgers ready?
-Almost there. Why the hurry?

02:46.680 --> 02:47.720
Get a move on.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.560
I said you had experience.
They're complaining.

02:49.640 --> 02:51.440
-Samu, don't bust my balls.
-Hurry.

02:54.120 --> 02:54.960
Here you are.

02:55.640 --> 02:58.080
We were so happy in this town
without these snobs!

02:58.160 --> 03:00.280
I don't know where she is.
Carla's avoiding me.

03:00.360 --> 03:01.840
You must have done something.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.320
You have to take care of her.
You won't find another one like her.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.080
I've told you before, haven't I? Huh?

03:08.160 --> 03:11.680
-Put your phone down, please. We are here!
-It's my dad. He wants me to train.

03:11.760 --> 03:13.960
-Sorry.
-Hey, waiter, thank you.

03:14.040 --> 03:16.360
-I've had faster service.
-Sorry. We have new staff.

03:16.440 --> 03:19.320
I wish you were as good at working
as you are at making excuses.

03:19.720 --> 03:20.880
This is overcooked.

03:20.960 --> 03:23.920
You know I can't answer back.
That's why you're doing this.

03:24.000 --> 03:26.640
-He's talking to me.
-Just eat it. It looks good.

03:32.520 --> 03:35.040
She read my message. It's blue.
Why won't she answer?

03:37.000 --> 03:38.280
I get it.

03:38.560 --> 03:40.000
-Is it clear?
-Yes.

03:40.080 --> 03:41.400
Nano, what's going on?

03:41.480 --> 03:42.320
Nothing.

03:43.240 --> 03:45.880
-Besides, they're leaving, right?
-That's up to you.

03:46.640 --> 03:47.560
Give me time.

03:53.200 --> 03:54.280
Good afternoon.

03:59.280 --> 04:02.240
-Nano, tell me what's going on.
-Samu, it's nothing.

04:05.960 --> 04:06.960
Forget it.

04:11.520 --> 04:13.320
Guys, I'm leaving.

04:13.400 --> 04:15.760
-You're leaving? How come?
-Gotta train, I told you.

04:15.840 --> 04:18.120
-But finish your food.
-If I do, I'll be late.

04:18.200 --> 04:19.920
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

04:20.760 --> 04:24.280
Should I write to her again or...
send her an audio message?

04:25.000 --> 04:27.280
I'll send her an audio message. Yeah.

04:46.920 --> 04:47.760
Hey.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.120
How much do you want?

05:01.320 --> 05:02.440
It's good, you'll see.

05:04.480 --> 05:07.240
Hey. We can finish this one if you want.

05:10.680 --> 05:12.040
Can I ask you a question?

05:15.320 --> 05:17.760
If it's about the other night,
it's best if you don't.

05:18.160 --> 05:20.560
I was drunk. And... I wanted to try.

05:21.400 --> 05:22.440
Just to try.

05:22.800 --> 05:25.400
Guys... are... not my thing.

05:29.880 --> 05:32.120
-What?
-You wanted to suck my dick.

05:47.480 --> 05:48.480
Come.

06:06.080 --> 06:06.920
You OK?

06:08.760 --> 06:09.600
Shit.

06:10.120 --> 06:11.320
They're freezing.

06:23.480 --> 06:24.480
What are you doing?

06:24.800 --> 06:27.280
Putting it on the seat,
so you're more comfortable.

06:30.080 --> 06:32.920
What is it? Thought the Muslim boy
was gonna rob you, or what?

06:40.160 --> 06:42.160
No, it's not that, but...

06:43.480 --> 06:44.760
I don't feel comfortable.

06:46.200 --> 06:47.360
Let's stop.

06:48.160 --> 06:49.040
What is it?

06:49.400 --> 06:50.760
It was you who wanted it.

06:51.560 --> 06:52.400
Dude...

06:53.520 --> 06:54.840
Are you really freaking out?

06:54.920 --> 06:57.520
No, but, leave me alone, OK? I'm going.

07:03.320 --> 07:04.880
<i>Describe your relationship</i>
<i>with the new kids.</i>

07:05.240 --> 07:07.920
-It was normal, nothing special.
-And with Omar?

07:09.200 --> 07:10.200
He's a friend.

07:11.520 --> 07:13.080
Ander. What's up, man?

07:13.160 --> 07:14.000
Hey.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.160
-How was training yesterday?
-Good.

07:17.800 --> 07:18.720
Very good, man.

07:18.800 --> 07:20.800
-My dad's cracking the whip, but good.
-OK.

07:22.520 --> 07:23.400
Listen.

07:24.200 --> 07:27.120
-You know you can tell me anything?
-Sure, I know.

07:27.800 --> 07:29.800
I mean,
we've been friends our entire lives.

07:30.080 --> 07:30.920
Yes.

07:32.240 --> 07:33.440
I'm off to train.

07:35.640 --> 07:36.520
<i>Now, a hobby.</i>

07:37.160 --> 07:40.520
<i>-You've been recording for ten minutes.</i>
<i>-Give me a hobby, and I'm done.</i>

07:40.880 --> 07:43.640
Seriously, I didn't plan
to work so hard on my part.

07:43.720 --> 07:45.640
I thought they strove for excellence here.

07:46.760 --> 07:50.840
-Tell me something I don't know.
-Fine, but not here. I'd feel awkward.

07:50.920 --> 07:51.760
Let's go.

08:02.720 --> 08:04.680
-Come on!
-What are we doing here?

08:04.760 --> 08:07.800
Don't ask. We have ten minutes
before the basketball players arrive.

08:07.920 --> 08:10.840
And you should know,
I've shown this to very few of my friends.

08:13.880 --> 08:14.760
Now I'm ready.

08:15.120 --> 08:17.120
-Are you recording?
-I'm recording.

08:18.120 --> 08:19.920
You'll end up with a great project.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.320
Why did you make these videos?

08:31.840 --> 08:33.320
For a school project.

08:43.480 --> 08:44.560
That's all.

08:45.320 --> 08:46.720
Marina loved to dance.

09:05.360 --> 09:06.200
Siblings?

09:06.280 --> 09:07.760
One, you know him. Nano.

09:09.000 --> 09:09.840
Nano.

09:10.360 --> 09:12.280
How's it going
in the kitchen at La Cabaña?

09:12.360 --> 09:14.120
For him, or for me since he started?

09:14.680 --> 09:17.480
OK. I'm writing you get along famously.

09:17.560 --> 09:18.880
So we're lying, right?

09:18.960 --> 09:21.520
Then you can write that I get along
with my brother.

09:29.320 --> 09:31.800
Look, I'm happy my brother is out of jail.

09:34.800 --> 09:36.400
It's just that sometimes...

09:38.200 --> 09:39.040
What?

09:41.040 --> 09:44.600
Let's not get intense. Photos.
Do we use what we have, or take new ones?

09:44.680 --> 09:47.680
I can dance, but posing for photos
is entirely different.

09:47.760 --> 09:48.880
Let me see.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
This folder.

09:50.880 --> 09:52.000
-Yes, that one.
-OK.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.560
This one's really cool.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.240
What are you talking about?

09:59.600 --> 10:02.080
This one's not bad,
but none of them show your face.

10:02.160 --> 10:04.280
-That's normal.
-Normal, yeah, right.

10:06.840 --> 10:08.840
CONSTRUCTION COMPANY NUNIER, INC.
RESPONSIBLE FOR COLLAPSE

10:08.920 --> 10:10.520
OF SAN ESTEBAN SECONDARY SCHOOL

10:14.880 --> 10:16.000
ENTREPRENEUR VENTURA NUNIER
INVOLVED IN FURIA SCANDAL

10:16.080 --> 10:16.920
What's this?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.520
Sorry.
I opened something I shouldn't have.

10:23.880 --> 10:28.040
-It's no secret he's my father, right?
-Why do you have all those articles?

10:29.320 --> 10:30.200
Well...

10:31.160 --> 10:32.440
Because...

10:33.640 --> 10:36.120
It doesn't matter.
Let's do this later, OK?

10:42.200 --> 10:43.680
-See you tomorrow, Carla.
-Bye.

10:48.160 --> 10:49.080
Hi there.

10:50.320 --> 10:52.080
See? No problem.

10:52.200 --> 10:54.400
OK. I didn't want to complicate stuff
with your boyfriend.

10:54.480 --> 10:57.480
Don't worry. We are only texting.

10:57.920 --> 11:00.400
Fine. I'll go smoke a joint,
and we'll talk later.

11:02.960 --> 11:04.040
What did he say?

11:05.120 --> 11:06.880
The poor thing is clueless.

11:08.000 --> 11:11.360
He's afraid if you see us talking,
you'll suspect and get jealous.

11:11.440 --> 11:12.920
Me? Jealous of that guy?

11:13.000 --> 11:15.680
He's more muscle than brain
and can't tell the difference--

11:16.360 --> 11:17.240
Of course not.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.320
How about we do it again?

11:21.160 --> 11:24.360
With Christian.
I'm so glad you persuaded me to do it.

11:24.440 --> 11:26.720
-I didn't persuade you.
-I want to do it again.

11:27.200 --> 11:28.800
Say yes, please.

11:32.320 --> 11:33.600
We'll talk later, OK?

11:35.280 --> 11:36.120
OK.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.480
So, how do we go about this? My--

11:44.760 --> 11:46.320
My place or yours?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.720
My parents wouldn't like me
to be seen with you.

11:48.840 --> 11:49.800
They don't know me.

11:50.040 --> 11:52.560
All my friends' mothers say
I'm the perfect son-in-law.

11:52.640 --> 11:56.640
For my parents, the perfect son-in-law
prays five times a day, facing Mecca.

11:56.720 --> 11:57.560
Do you do it?

11:57.960 --> 11:59.640
Yes. It helps me find myself.

11:59.720 --> 12:01.800
We're not getting married.
It's a project.

12:01.960 --> 12:03.800
Can't we work on it during breaks?

12:04.000 --> 12:06.360
I've written some questions.
Answer them by tomorrow.

12:07.480 --> 12:08.600
And we're done.

12:08.960 --> 12:10.280
We'll talk tomorrow.

12:12.920 --> 12:13.760
Wow.

12:14.760 --> 12:18.280
I think Miss Palestine is not going
to make it easy for you.

12:18.640 --> 12:21.800
If I were you...
I'd put in a little more effort, honey.

12:23.240 --> 12:24.840
-Please!
-Shut up!

12:33.320 --> 12:34.160
Excuse us.

12:34.320 --> 12:35.880
We have this project--

12:46.520 --> 12:47.680
-Hi.
-Hi.

12:47.760 --> 12:49.120
I'm looking for Samuel.

12:49.280 --> 12:51.000
He's on a break. Out back.

12:51.160 --> 12:52.640
-That way.
-Thanks.

13:03.320 --> 13:04.160
Hey.

13:05.640 --> 13:06.840
Hey, what's going on?

13:06.920 --> 13:10.160
-I was looking for your brother.
-And you found me.

13:10.920 --> 13:12.840
It's gonna become a habit.

13:13.840 --> 13:14.920
Fuck!

13:19.080 --> 13:20.640
How's everything here?

13:21.560 --> 13:23.560
Fantastic. I'm a total chef.

13:26.000 --> 13:26.840
I can tell.

13:33.120 --> 13:33.960
Hello.

13:34.440 --> 13:36.000
They told me you were out here.

13:36.600 --> 13:38.920
-Want some?
-No, thanks. Enjoy.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.640
Listen... Sorry I left like that.

13:43.520 --> 13:44.360
Don't worry.

13:45.160 --> 13:46.920
Want to work on the project?

13:49.040 --> 13:52.360
<i>My name is Marina,</i>
<i>and as you know, I like to dance.</i>

13:52.560 --> 13:56.040
<i>But what I would really like to do</i>
<i>is make documentaries.</i>

13:56.240 --> 13:58.000
<i>Do investigative reports.</i>

13:59.320 --> 14:01.520
The truth is,
that has always been my dream.

14:01.600 --> 14:02.960
Although, I don't know now...

14:03.640 --> 14:06.560
-Why not?
-How could I call myself a journalist

14:06.640 --> 14:10.680
if I now have the chance
to expose somebody, and I don't do it?

14:12.120 --> 14:14.720
Nobody's gonna blame you
for not ruining your father.

14:14.800 --> 14:17.520
Not even if I had incriminating evidence?

14:20.440 --> 14:23.960
There's money in the safe
in my father's office at home.

14:24.640 --> 14:27.320
And, about a year ago,
I needed to take some.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.800
We all know the combination.
It's my date of birth.

14:31.160 --> 14:34.720
So, I opened the safe,
and there were photos,

14:35.400 --> 14:37.400
documents, and some emails.

14:37.960 --> 14:40.320
They were addressed to a minister
in the government.

14:40.880 --> 14:44.160
My father was telling him that,
because the budget was so tight,

14:44.240 --> 14:46.480
the materials might not be
of the best quality.

14:47.600 --> 14:49.120
Was it about my school?

14:49.280 --> 14:50.160
I don't know,

14:50.240 --> 14:53.000
but I think something similar happened
with your school.

14:56.560 --> 14:59.200
Now you know more than any of my friends.

15:00.400 --> 15:03.240
Don't even think of using that
in the project, OK?

15:03.320 --> 15:06.080
Of course I will!
After the part about you liking to dance.

15:06.160 --> 15:09.080
-That you have a corrupt father.
-Don't even joke about that.

15:09.160 --> 15:10.680
-But of course!
-Samuel.

15:11.000 --> 15:12.040
Break is over.

15:15.080 --> 15:16.960
-See you tomorrow.
-See you tomorrow.

15:18.360 --> 15:19.280
Waiter!

15:32.920 --> 15:34.040
Bye, thanks.

15:37.680 --> 15:39.400
Hi, how are you? Go ahead, please.

15:43.400 --> 15:44.240
Hello.

15:46.400 --> 15:47.240
Good afternoon.

15:47.320 --> 15:50.760
-Why are you here? What do you want?
-To introduce myself to your parents.

15:50.840 --> 15:53.960
Hi, how are you?
Guzmán Nunier, pleased to meet you.

15:54.040 --> 15:55.840
-I'm your daughter's classmate.
-Hello.

15:56.480 --> 16:00.080
-I came to ask if I may study with her.
-You'd better leave.

16:00.880 --> 16:02.480
Why? What's the matter?

16:02.560 --> 16:05.560
That I'm not a Muslim?
That my father is who he is? What is it?

16:05.680 --> 16:07.400
I said we'd work during breaks.

16:07.600 --> 16:09.840
-What's the problem? Who's his father?
-Dad...

16:09.920 --> 16:11.920
-Guzmán, go.
-He paid for her scholarship.

16:12.000 --> 16:14.280
I think it would be best
if you let me stay...

16:14.760 --> 16:15.760
and work with her.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.800
Why have you come here? To insult me?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.880
Do you know, because of your father,
my son and others

16:23.960 --> 16:26.320
have to travel 30 km to go to school?

16:27.040 --> 16:28.920
Do you know
how many kids could have died?

16:30.120 --> 16:34.720
Sir, I've come in good faith
to ask if I can work with your daughter.

16:35.200 --> 16:36.040
Leave.

16:41.000 --> 16:42.120
Enough, Guzmán.

16:45.640 --> 16:48.720
What do I have to buy so you let me stay
and explain myself?

16:55.800 --> 16:56.760
What's going on?

16:59.800 --> 17:01.800
Guzmán, please. Go.

17:22.360 --> 17:26.480
We know this is a difficult time.
But we need to ask you some questions.

17:27.920 --> 17:30.200
How was your relationship
with your sister?

17:30.280 --> 17:31.800
What kind of question is that?

17:33.800 --> 17:35.040
I loved her very much.

17:49.600 --> 17:50.760
Hi, sweetie.

17:53.320 --> 17:55.000
Have you taken your medication?

17:58.000 --> 18:02.080
Listen, if you have any discomfort,
nausea, or whatever, tell me, OK?

18:07.440 --> 18:08.720
-Hi, Mommy.
-Hi, sweetie.

18:08.800 --> 18:10.600
-Are you OK?
-Yes, great.

18:20.240 --> 18:24.280
You know Mom only talks about my pills
when she mixes anxiety meds with alcohol?

18:24.600 --> 18:26.160
It's hard for her, Marina.

18:27.680 --> 18:29.680
It's no picnic for me either.

18:30.080 --> 18:30.920
Hey.

18:31.280 --> 18:32.760
Hey, Marina.

18:34.640 --> 18:35.720
What did we say?

18:36.080 --> 18:36.920
Huh?

18:38.200 --> 18:40.480
Through good times, bad times, and?

18:41.040 --> 18:43.040
And the times that are fucked up.

19:09.360 --> 19:11.360
What are you doing?
The store's unattended.

19:11.440 --> 19:12.880
I'm going. Don't worry.

19:12.960 --> 19:15.120
-Keep an eye on it.
-Yes. Nag.

19:22.920 --> 19:25.640
HI, ARE YOU STILL FREAKED OUT?

19:35.440 --> 19:38.440
<i>There's money in the safe</i>
<i>in my father's office at home.</i>

19:38.520 --> 19:40.840
<i>We all know the combination.</i>
<i>It's my date of birth.</i>

19:40.920 --> 19:43.480
<i>To give it a sentimental touch.</i>

19:45.120 --> 19:46.560
What are you doing?

19:47.000 --> 19:49.440
Recording fancy girl in your free time?

19:49.920 --> 19:52.720
-It's for a school project.
-A school project.

19:53.120 --> 19:56.000
How modern. Come on, Spielberg,
it's dinner time.

20:00.560 --> 20:03.400
GORGEOUS, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

20:06.720 --> 20:09.400
WAITING FOR YOU IN MY BED...
THINKING OF YOU

20:13.840 --> 20:16.760
DON'T SAY THAT, YOU ARE KILLING ME...

20:20.520 --> 20:22.160
-Hi, hon.
-Hi.

20:22.520 --> 20:25.360
-What are you doing?
-Chatting with Christian.

20:26.040 --> 20:28.320
<i>-About what?</i>
-Not much.

20:28.840 --> 20:30.440
But it was getting interesting.

20:30.960 --> 20:33.280
<i>Do you want to join me so it gets better?</i>

20:33.680 --> 20:35.840
<i>We'll have a good time.</i>
<i>What do I tell him?</i>

20:36.200 --> 20:40.040
Tell him you only get turned on
if they know how to play.

20:40.120 --> 20:42.280
<i>And ask him if he knows how to play.</i>

20:42.600 --> 20:44.600
<i>And if he's willing to go all the way.</i>

20:44.760 --> 20:46.120
You are into this!

20:47.160 --> 20:49.840
He wants to know
what my boyfriend would think.

20:49.920 --> 20:53.880
That you're a very naughty girlfriend.
And you want to be worse than naughty.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.760
<i>I am a very naughty girlfriend.</i>

20:57.880 --> 21:00.680
And I want to be... worse than naughty.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.040
<i>What would you do to me</i>
<i>if I were there with you?</i>

21:06.200 --> 21:07.840
I'd treat you like a queen.

21:07.960 --> 21:10.120
Tell him you have your boyfriend for that.

21:10.200 --> 21:12.440
Now, I'm in the mood for something else.

21:15.520 --> 21:16.520
<i>He says...</i>

21:16.920 --> 21:18.280
<i>"I'm so turned on."</i>

21:20.360 --> 21:21.200
Should I continue?

21:21.280 --> 21:22.440
Make him come.

21:30.960 --> 21:31.840
Hey, you.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.840
-Yes, you.
-Christian.

21:34.320 --> 21:39.120
Whatever your name is. I have a question.
Do you know this Muslim guy?

21:39.200 --> 21:40.840
-Nadia's brother?
-Yes, Omar.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.800
-Why? Who talked to you about him?
-Ander, he told me about him.

21:43.880 --> 21:47.240
Buddy, you want to score?
Wow, I didn't think you smoked, but...

21:47.320 --> 21:50.680
-I guess we all have our vices, huh?
-Right. And what exactly does he sell?

21:50.800 --> 21:53.680
-He has grass, paki, pollen, acorns--
-Acorns?

21:53.760 --> 21:55.440
Another kind of hash, dude. Softer.

21:55.520 --> 21:57.160
-They're drugs, right? Okay.
-Joints.

21:57.240 --> 21:59.240
Whatever you want, he can get it.

21:59.320 --> 22:01.320
Give me a call,
and I'll send you his number.

22:03.360 --> 22:06.320
-Already thinking about planting a bomb?
-Yes, on your face!

22:07.440 --> 22:08.600
...on your face!

22:16.400 --> 22:17.880
Hi, Nadia.

22:20.920 --> 22:22.560
Listen, sorry about yesterday.

22:22.640 --> 22:25.640
-It got out of hand.
-I shouldn't be talking to you.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.160
What were you thinking?

22:27.240 --> 22:31.240
I went with the best intentions
to show your father I am a good person.

22:31.800 --> 22:32.800
Nailed it.

22:34.360 --> 22:36.840
After all,
arrogance runs through your veins.

22:40.080 --> 22:41.800
Nadia.

22:44.880 --> 22:46.040
Good morning!

22:48.560 --> 22:50.080
How can I make it up to you?

22:51.320 --> 22:52.240
Relax.

22:53.160 --> 22:54.000
And nothing.

22:54.520 --> 22:56.280
I finished the project without you.

22:56.360 --> 22:59.640
The information I had was enough
to finish your profile.

23:03.760 --> 23:04.600
Martín.

23:05.160 --> 23:07.480
I have a question. It's about the project.

23:08.320 --> 23:12.520
Nadia says she's finished,
but I really think it's incomplete.

23:13.200 --> 23:14.680
-May I?
-Yes, of course.

23:19.200 --> 23:21.200
Is this all you have?

23:21.640 --> 23:22.960
Four photos and...

23:23.840 --> 23:24.720
I don't know.

23:24.800 --> 23:28.200
How much more does one need
to introduce oneself on social media?

23:28.840 --> 23:31.920
Nadia, I think there's something
you haven't understood.

23:32.000 --> 23:34.360
At this school,
we take projects very seriously.

23:34.800 --> 23:38.400
They're as important as exams.
Or even more. This is a demanding task.

23:39.240 --> 23:42.400
Guys,
I thought I had explained myself clearly.

23:43.200 --> 23:44.960
When I read your profiles,

23:45.040 --> 23:47.520
I want to get a clear idea
of who your partner is.

23:47.600 --> 23:49.440
You're making a lot of effort, Martín,

23:49.520 --> 23:51.720
for someone
who doesn't deserve much attention.

23:51.800 --> 23:53.880
No, I don't try too hard.

23:53.960 --> 23:57.120
I think she can do it,
and she can be the best in the class.

23:57.200 --> 23:59.200
You all can if you try.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.120
<i>The emails were addressed to a minister</i>
<i>in the government.</i>

24:16.320 --> 24:19.600
<i>My father was telling him that,</i>
<i>because the budget was so tight,</i>

24:19.680 --> 24:21.760
<i>the materials might not be</i>
<i>of the best quality.</i>

24:21.840 --> 24:24.360
I can't stop thinking
about our chat yesterday.

24:24.640 --> 24:25.960
It was very instructive.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.600
-We'll have to put that into practice.
-I'm all yours.

24:28.680 --> 24:30.560
Your place or mine? Probably yours.

24:30.640 --> 24:32.640
Are you going to meet up
with this moron?

24:32.720 --> 24:35.040
-What about Polo?
-Guzmán, mind your own business.

24:35.120 --> 24:37.800
-My friend's girlfriend is my business.
-Not at all.

24:37.880 --> 24:41.080
-You heard her, man. Go away.
-You can't order me around in my school.

24:41.160 --> 24:45.760
Too bad your school's my school.
Besides, we're both asking you, so... go.

24:45.840 --> 24:47.560
Let me explain this to you, you idiot.

24:47.640 --> 24:49.040
Neither you nor anybody

24:49.120 --> 24:51.400
from your shitty town can say anything
to me.

24:51.480 --> 24:53.400
Know why?
Because, to me, you don't exist.

24:53.560 --> 24:55.960
If I hit you,
that might confirm my existence.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.080
What are you doing?

24:57.160 --> 24:59.280
This nobody is trying to steal
your girlfriend.

24:59.520 --> 25:03.400
"Your girlfriend, my school, my rules."
Your concept of property is a bit much.

25:03.480 --> 25:05.560
If I get the girl,
it's because she wants it.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.000
You calm down, too.

25:07.080 --> 25:10.120
-Sorry, babe.
-Did you hear that? He calls her "babe"!

25:10.200 --> 25:11.200
Look, don't...

25:11.800 --> 25:13.840
Let's go, Guzmán. Please.

25:15.480 --> 25:16.320
That's enough.

25:16.760 --> 25:19.120
So, at your place, then? We'll talk.

25:21.640 --> 25:24.560
Why were you so calm
while I defended your girlfriend?

25:24.640 --> 25:28.520
-Why are you getting involved?
-Because he's stealing her, don't you see?

25:28.600 --> 25:31.000
Don't be old-fashioned.
You sound like a Neanderthal.

25:31.080 --> 25:33.480
Whatever you say,
but I know what I saw.

25:33.560 --> 25:36.280
-So put an end to this, Polo--
-Guzmán, it's arranged.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.480
She's hooking up with him
because I want her to.

25:39.640 --> 25:40.840
It's a game, OK?

25:41.160 --> 25:42.600
Let's see, Polo...

25:43.720 --> 25:46.280
What the fuck do you win in this game?

25:46.360 --> 25:48.120
But, Guzmán, we're using him.

25:48.520 --> 25:51.320
She hooks up with him,
but I tell her what to do with him.

25:52.080 --> 25:53.520
And while they do it...

25:55.080 --> 25:56.000
I watch them.

25:57.320 --> 25:58.200
But, man...

25:58.400 --> 25:59.760
Shit, all right.

26:01.040 --> 26:03.080
I didn't know things were that bad.

26:03.400 --> 26:05.960
-But--
-Listen, what if Carla falls for him?

26:08.720 --> 26:09.560
Anyway...

26:11.080 --> 26:13.280
End this as soon as possible, Polito.

26:13.600 --> 26:14.440
OK?

26:19.480 --> 26:22.480
Martín? I have a question. May I come in?

26:22.560 --> 26:24.240
-Yes, of course.
-Thank you.

26:24.680 --> 26:26.680
I know that...

26:27.680 --> 26:30.800
with the new kids getting
into the school and...

26:31.000 --> 26:32.480
them being at a disadvantage,

26:32.560 --> 26:35.720
it's logical for you
to give them more attention.

26:36.520 --> 26:38.640
How can I say it without sounding rude?

26:39.440 --> 26:42.320
Don't worry,
I'm sure you'll find the words. Tell me.

26:42.600 --> 26:43.640
Do you think

26:44.080 --> 26:49.400
it's OK to pay more attention to a girl
with such archaic and non-feminist values?

26:51.560 --> 26:52.920
You want me to discriminate?

26:53.000 --> 26:56.360
No, just don't pay
so much attention to her.

26:58.080 --> 27:00.680
She doesn't pay your salary,
the rest of the parents do.

27:02.400 --> 27:05.120
I am your teacher, Lu, not your employee.

27:05.200 --> 27:08.480
And I'm telling you
that your contract is renewed annually.

27:08.680 --> 27:12.520
And that the idea of the new kids
getting into the school was not...

27:13.040 --> 27:14.240
popular with our parents.

27:14.320 --> 27:15.520
It was just a front.

27:17.760 --> 27:18.800
Think about it.

27:18.880 --> 27:21.480
About whose side you are on.
Have a nice day.

27:22.880 --> 27:26.120
I wish those three had never come
to the school, that's all.

27:26.480 --> 27:30.200
-Do you hate them so much?
-I'm not the only one, I can assure you.

27:40.600 --> 27:41.440
Hello.

27:42.520 --> 27:44.600
Hello. What are you doing here?

27:44.680 --> 27:47.080
-Want to work on the project?
-Sure.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.680
Do you want to take pictures
since we have good lighting?

27:53.760 --> 27:57.920
-Don't be shy, tell me how to pose.
-I think this is stupid.

28:02.280 --> 28:03.120
Let me see.

28:06.920 --> 28:09.600
Is this how you see me? Only this?

28:10.680 --> 28:13.560
Don't be afraid to sexualize me.
Relax, take a couple more.

28:13.640 --> 28:14.720
Get dressed.

28:15.920 --> 28:17.920
You are so boring, really.

28:18.400 --> 28:20.520
-What are you doing?
-Who cares? No one's here.

28:23.200 --> 28:25.600
Since we are here,
and you're not looking at me...

28:25.680 --> 28:27.080
at least ask me questions, OK?

28:27.480 --> 28:28.760
Well... I don't know.

28:29.480 --> 28:32.000
Why were you hell-bent
on doing this project with me?

28:32.200 --> 28:33.760
To make fun of me?

28:34.880 --> 28:38.080
Since you're not taking pictures,
I'll take one of you. Stand there.

28:38.320 --> 28:39.600
There's good light.

28:43.360 --> 28:44.200
Let's see.

28:46.480 --> 28:47.320
Turn around.

28:49.680 --> 28:51.240
Turn slightly to your left.

28:52.280 --> 28:54.560
To your left, Nadia! Are you dyslexic?

29:01.640 --> 29:03.400
-I should delete it.
-Why?

29:04.120 --> 29:08.000
It doesn't say anything about you.
I have no fucking idea who you are.

29:09.480 --> 29:10.760
I'll wait for you outside.

29:16.280 --> 29:17.120
What happened?

29:18.200 --> 29:21.240
Some men came asking for Nano.

29:22.000 --> 29:24.760
I didn't let them in,
and they forced the door open.

29:24.840 --> 29:26.560
-Let me get this--
-Nothing happened.

29:29.680 --> 29:31.720
They only meant to scare her, that's all.

29:32.040 --> 29:34.760
-I told her it won't happen again.
-Was it the guys from La Cabaña?

29:35.080 --> 29:36.240
Who from La Cabaña?

29:37.640 --> 29:39.520
-What about La Cabaña?
-Come.

29:39.600 --> 29:42.040
Who from La Cabaña?
What did you get into?

29:42.200 --> 29:43.040
Shut the door.

29:45.920 --> 29:46.960
Tell me, Nano...

29:47.200 --> 29:50.400
do you think it's normal for junkies
to come here and threaten Mom?

29:50.480 --> 29:54.360
-I owe a lot of money, Samu. A lot.
-What? You just got out of jail.

29:54.440 --> 29:58.400
I owe it to people in there.
To the people who protected me.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.840
-I promised them a lot of money.
-What are you saying?

30:03.000 --> 30:05.720
-What are you saying?
-Things were messed up there.

30:05.840 --> 30:07.760
And I had to find a way to get by.

30:08.680 --> 30:10.600
Look at the present they gave me.

30:13.440 --> 30:16.880
I didn't tell you so as not to scare you.
But now, I need to pay up.

30:18.240 --> 30:21.120
If something happens to me,
I don't care, it's my problem.

30:21.200 --> 30:24.520
-But I can't let anything happen to you.
-Are you being serious, Nano?

30:24.600 --> 30:26.000
Do I look like I'm joking?

30:28.280 --> 30:29.120
Help me.

30:33.520 --> 30:34.360
How?

30:38.160 --> 30:39.880
I saw what fancy girl told you.

30:40.640 --> 30:42.360
About her father's papers.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.200
Help me get them.
I can sell them, blackmail him.

30:46.400 --> 30:49.320
You're telling me you used my computer
when I've told you--

30:49.400 --> 30:51.760
Can you think of a better way
to get 40,000 bucks?

30:51.840 --> 30:53.640
If you have one, tell me.

30:56.360 --> 30:59.280
Nano, you're on fucking parole.
I can't let you do that.

31:04.080 --> 31:06.240
If I don't do it, we are fucked.

31:06.560 --> 31:08.560
Mom... you, and I.

31:14.240 --> 31:15.600
Brother, I'm screwed.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.320
I'll do it myself.

31:38.520 --> 31:40.120
I'll get you the papers.

31:53.560 --> 31:54.880
-Hi.
-Hello.

32:08.960 --> 32:09.840
Fuck!

32:17.200 --> 32:18.480
Looking for this?

32:22.560 --> 32:25.640
You have no right to search my room.
How did you find it?

32:25.720 --> 32:27.440
Guzmán, a good friend of yours.

32:29.360 --> 32:33.080
Do you know what can happen
if you test positive for drugs?

32:34.000 --> 32:36.960
-It's the second time I've bought.
-And why?

32:37.040 --> 32:40.240
-Why do you want to ruin your career?
-Come on, it's just a joint.

32:40.960 --> 32:41.960
You are an idiot.

32:43.840 --> 32:45.000
This is the last time.

32:52.120 --> 32:52.960
Carla.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.440
I think we should drop
this thing with Christian.

32:58.160 --> 33:00.040
-Why?
-I've been talking to Guzmán.

33:00.120 --> 33:01.200
For fuck's sake.

33:01.800 --> 33:04.520
As I was telling him about it,
I realized it sounded crazy.

33:05.320 --> 33:06.600
What are we doing?

33:06.960 --> 33:09.920
Are we really going to stop experimenting
and having fun

33:10.000 --> 33:11.600
because of what your friend thinks?

33:13.560 --> 33:14.960
We all know what he's like.

33:19.360 --> 33:21.760
Listen, we are playing with fire.

33:22.320 --> 33:23.400
It's not normal.

33:23.840 --> 33:26.560
It's not normal for people our age
to do these things.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.560
And that's it.

33:27.800 --> 33:30.240
-Right?
-When have you and I been normal?

33:30.960 --> 33:32.360
My mom's a wine-making marchioness,

33:32.440 --> 33:35.440
and your moms are a pair of rich
and influential lesbians.

33:35.520 --> 33:37.640
You and I are anything but normal.

33:38.240 --> 33:39.080
I don't know.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.120
You don't want to relive the other day?

33:43.800 --> 33:44.640
Or yesterday?

33:45.120 --> 33:49.040
Because I can't stop thinking about it.
And I know you.

33:49.440 --> 33:52.720
-I know you feel the same.
-I don't think it's the same.

33:52.920 --> 33:56.680
Our lives are already written.
And I'm not saying they're bad lives.

33:56.880 --> 34:00.280
But, why not stray from the script,
at least a little bit?

34:00.880 --> 34:01.720
I don't know.

34:01.800 --> 34:03.240
-What don't you know?
-I don't know.

34:03.320 --> 34:04.880
-What? That you love me?
-Huh?

34:04.960 --> 34:06.240
-I do love you.
-I love you.

34:06.320 --> 34:07.760
-And you?
-I love you.

34:07.840 --> 34:09.040
-I love you.
-I love you.

34:37.080 --> 34:37.960
Wait in the lobby.

34:38.040 --> 34:40.400
We'll continue talking in a while.
Thank you.

34:40.920 --> 34:42.280
Polo, you may come in.

34:44.600 --> 34:46.440
Sorry, why do you want to talk to me?

34:46.520 --> 34:48.920
They are questioning everybody,
don't worry.

34:51.440 --> 34:52.480
They suspect Guzmán.

35:04.680 --> 35:05.960
Really? Yes.

35:10.840 --> 35:12.040
Good morning!

35:13.240 --> 35:14.280
Good morning.

35:14.800 --> 35:16.920
-Good morning.
-A bit sluggish this morning?

35:17.000 --> 35:18.240
I'm a little tired.

35:18.880 --> 35:22.360
I have to show you what I've done.
I have your profile almost ready.

35:23.160 --> 35:25.600
I am still a bit stuck with yours.

35:26.280 --> 35:27.200
How come?

35:27.600 --> 35:30.160
We can work on it
this afternoon at my place.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.320
Sure.

35:32.680 --> 35:35.640
But my mom's at home.
It may be better to do it at yours.

35:35.720 --> 35:36.560
Of course.

35:37.160 --> 35:39.720
-Are you OK?
-Yes. I'm still sleepy.

35:40.160 --> 35:42.200
-What the fuck did you do?
-Calm down.

35:42.280 --> 35:45.400
-You got me in trouble!
-I'm worried about you. You're my friend.

35:45.480 --> 35:47.720
Then talk to me,
don't snitch to my parents.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.480
You know how I feel about drugs.

35:49.560 --> 35:52.440
-After what happened to my sister.
-Get over it already!

35:52.520 --> 35:55.760
Get over what happened!
And stop messing with the rest of us.

35:56.640 --> 35:58.560
Would you say Guzmán is violent?

35:59.320 --> 36:00.640
You suspect Guzmán?

36:01.440 --> 36:04.240
Guzmán wouldn't hurt his sister
or anybody else.

36:04.440 --> 36:05.840
It's just a draft.

36:05.920 --> 36:08.360
If you want,
we can change the whole thing.

36:08.840 --> 36:11.400
I don't know.
I feel a little exposed, Samuel.

36:11.760 --> 36:13.400
Besides, you end it by saying:

36:13.480 --> 36:16.720
"Sad, intelligent eyes
which seem to have suffered too much."

36:16.800 --> 36:18.720
-Too much?
-I don't know.

36:18.800 --> 36:22.640
Maybe this is nothing but a bored
and vain rich girl putting on an act.

36:23.200 --> 36:24.800
Why would you do that?

36:25.560 --> 36:29.400
To keep guys away
and avoid being upended by love again.

36:30.800 --> 36:32.320
I've never felt that.

36:34.600 --> 36:36.440
You're not missing out, really.

36:39.400 --> 36:41.000
You don't want it to happen again?

36:42.160 --> 36:43.800
I don't know, it scares me.

36:47.280 --> 36:48.680
What are you scared of?

36:49.320 --> 36:50.680
Hello. How are you?

36:50.920 --> 36:52.680
Hi. What are you doing here?

36:52.760 --> 36:54.640
How did you let him talk you into this?

36:55.840 --> 36:58.400
-She's here to work on the project.
-So is Samu.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.880
-Hello.
-Hello.

37:01.840 --> 37:03.960
OK, we're off.
We don't want to bother you.

37:04.040 --> 37:04.880
OK.

37:06.520 --> 37:10.720
Nadia. Don't let him tease you too much.
Whistle if you need me, OK?

37:12.960 --> 37:13.840
Guzmán!

37:15.280 --> 37:18.600
Honey, I'm calling you, and you're...
You're not answering.

37:18.680 --> 37:20.760
I don't know what you're doing,
or where you are.

37:20.840 --> 37:23.160
Please, call me when you get this, OK?

37:26.640 --> 37:27.480
So?

37:28.600 --> 37:30.240
Why are you being so flattering?

37:31.080 --> 37:34.240
Am I a challenge,
or a bet you made with your friends?

37:34.520 --> 37:37.240
Let's see how long it takes
the Muslim girl to fall for me.

37:38.760 --> 37:39.600
What?

37:40.200 --> 37:41.400
Is your self-esteem so low

37:41.480 --> 37:43.880
that you think
I'd only be with you because of a bet?

37:44.960 --> 37:46.280
Then I'm a challenge.

37:46.800 --> 37:49.520
-The impossible turns you on.
-I feel comfortable with you.

37:50.120 --> 37:51.360
We have a lot in common.

37:52.360 --> 37:54.320
Come now, I doubt that.

37:54.880 --> 37:56.800
Well, you believe in your God.

37:56.880 --> 37:59.000
You respect your parents.
You're responsible.

37:59.440 --> 38:00.640
Me too. Look.

38:01.280 --> 38:02.560
Here we go again!

38:06.720 --> 38:07.720
See?

38:08.280 --> 38:11.000
Only I wouldn't strip
to show you I believe in Allah.

38:12.840 --> 38:17.080
-Put your shirt on. Or you'll catch cold.
-We all have our ways, Nadia.

38:17.160 --> 38:21.080
And it is true that I often use my body
and my charm to get what I want.

38:21.320 --> 38:23.120
Maybe I don't quite believe

38:23.200 --> 38:26.240
someone could like me
just for what I think or feel.

38:32.880 --> 38:36.480
-Do you have your cell phone on you?
-Want to take a picture?

38:38.920 --> 38:39.760
No.

38:41.320 --> 38:42.160
No!

38:42.840 --> 38:44.800
-Well?
-Guzmán.

38:44.880 --> 38:46.280
Not so brave now, huh?

38:47.040 --> 38:48.840
-Please!
-Come on, laugh now!

38:48.920 --> 38:50.880
-Come on, stop it.
-Laugh at me now.

38:50.960 --> 38:53.160
-Go on, laugh.
-Please, Guzmán!

38:54.200 --> 38:55.080
-No!
-Look.

38:55.680 --> 38:57.320
-Please!
-No.

38:58.240 --> 39:00.000
-Come.
-Guzmán! Please!

39:01.800 --> 39:02.760
I was winning.

39:05.400 --> 39:06.800
OK. Should we continue?

39:17.720 --> 39:21.240
-Can I use your bathroom?
-Sure, it's right over there.

39:22.360 --> 39:23.200
Right...

39:25.040 --> 39:28.200
I don't feel so good,
and it would be embarrassing...

39:29.360 --> 39:31.640
-Use the one downstairs.
-OK, thanks.

39:34.320 --> 39:37.320
You still need a couple of photos
at the end, but it's ready.

39:39.640 --> 39:40.520
Hi, Dad.

39:40.600 --> 39:41.440
<i>Hi, Nadia.</i>

39:41.960 --> 39:43.240
<i>-Are you at school?</i>
-No.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.360
I'm with Samuel, doing homework.

39:45.480 --> 39:47.360
-Sure, with the waiter.
<i>-Put him on.</i>

39:47.440 --> 39:49.920
<i>-I want to ask him something.</i>
-Eh... Of course.

39:50.320 --> 39:52.520
He's in the bathroom, one second.

39:53.400 --> 39:55.880
-Shit, I have to find Samuel.
-Go.

40:34.400 --> 40:35.240
Marina!

40:35.320 --> 40:37.400
-Have you seen Samuel?
-He's in the bathroom.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.920
-The one downstairs.
-Shit!

40:40.440 --> 40:41.280
Samuel.

40:41.960 --> 40:44.600
<i>-Hello? You still there?</i>
-Dad, one moment.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.040
What am I doing?

40:57.000 --> 40:57.840
Samuel!

41:03.720 --> 41:05.080
-Samuel!
-What?

41:05.800 --> 41:06.640
It's my father.

41:06.720 --> 41:09.400
-Tell him we are studying at your house.
<i>-Hello?</i>

41:10.120 --> 41:11.520
Hi, Mr. Shanaa. It's Samuel.

41:11.600 --> 41:14.160
We are at home, working on something
for school.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.920
-We're almost done.
-What are you doing?

41:16.000 --> 41:17.320
I couldn't find the bathroom.

41:17.400 --> 41:19.680
-It's down there!
-I couldn't find it.

41:21.760 --> 41:23.360
Nadia will be there soon, OK?

41:36.880 --> 41:38.040
Nice place!

41:39.000 --> 41:40.640
Listen, where's your mother?

41:40.720 --> 41:41.560
ALMOST THERE

41:41.640 --> 41:43.680
-She's rarely here.
-Right, of course.

41:43.920 --> 41:46.120
I suppose marchionesses
also have things to do.

41:46.200 --> 41:47.600
-Hello, Mirella.
-Hello.

41:47.680 --> 41:48.520
Hello.

41:48.880 --> 41:52.200
Yeah, well, she always says
they have been social parasites,

41:52.280 --> 41:55.880
and a blight on this country,
but she got into wine.

41:56.440 --> 41:58.560
Into making it, that is,
not drinking it.

41:58.640 --> 42:01.040
Although, every now and then,
she opens a bottle.

42:01.400 --> 42:04.120
-I'll introduce you one day.
-OK. Cool.

42:05.160 --> 42:08.720
Wow, nice bathtub you marquises have!

42:20.240 --> 42:21.520
-Hello, Mirella.
-Hello.

42:21.600 --> 42:22.880
Carla is expecting me.

42:25.560 --> 42:27.960
Hey, you don't see me
just as a sex object, right?

42:51.800 --> 42:52.800
It's OK!

42:53.440 --> 42:56.440
It's OK, don't worry. You can carry on.

42:56.520 --> 43:00.800
On the plus side, I'm more comfortable
than I was at Marina's.

43:00.880 --> 43:01.720
Polo.

43:02.320 --> 43:04.040
-What?
-You haven't told him?

43:04.680 --> 43:06.760
The other day, I was there, watching you.

43:07.280 --> 43:09.960
Did you think you'd fuck my girl
without me enjoying it?

43:10.040 --> 43:10.880
Polo!

43:11.000 --> 43:13.360
What's he talking about? Is that true?

43:14.040 --> 43:14.880
You knew?

43:16.560 --> 43:17.920
Poor guy!

43:18.160 --> 43:20.840
He thought he was hooking up
with a Spanish grandee.

43:20.920 --> 43:22.960
You imagined yourself a married winemaker?

43:23.040 --> 43:24.240
You're making fun of me?

43:24.320 --> 43:25.400
-No, we're not.
-No.

43:25.480 --> 43:26.560
I think you are.

43:31.200 --> 43:33.080
Fucking rich people!

43:33.520 --> 43:35.040
-Let's talk.
-Fucking snobs.

43:35.120 --> 43:35.960
Christian!

43:36.040 --> 43:39.520
-Let's talk about it.
-No! Do you realize what you have?

43:39.600 --> 43:41.400
Take care of her, please, man!

43:41.840 --> 43:44.360
You can't let people fuck her!

43:44.480 --> 43:47.040
And you watching, on top of it!
Fuck off, will you?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.040
Good evening.

43:57.080 --> 43:58.800
How can you be so stupid?

43:58.880 --> 44:01.000
If you didn't want to,
you should have told me.

44:02.280 --> 44:04.600
I did tell you,
but you didn't listen to me.

44:05.600 --> 44:06.440
What's the matter?

44:07.080 --> 44:09.480
Do you care so much
about that bumpkin's feelings?

44:11.600 --> 44:13.240
The only bumpkin here...

44:14.080 --> 44:14.920
is you.

44:17.200 --> 44:18.600
Fuck off!

44:22.600 --> 44:25.000
You don't tell me to fuck off, Carla.
Carla!

44:30.200 --> 44:32.920
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

44:36.160 --> 44:39.240
HEY, FINALLY

44:40.040 --> 44:41.360
SORRY. I'VE BEEN BUSY

44:41.480 --> 44:44.000
WANT SOME POT?

44:45.160 --> 44:48.520
NO, I'D RATHER SEE YOU WITHOUT AN EXCUSE

44:51.520 --> 44:53.600
-Hi, darling.
-Hi, Dad.

44:54.840 --> 44:56.240
How did it go with Samuel?

44:56.800 --> 44:59.360
It went well. We finished the project.

44:59.760 --> 45:00.880
Were you at Samuel's?

45:05.520 --> 45:07.400
-Dad...
-I didn't expect this from you.

45:08.120 --> 45:11.120
You lied to me.
Daughters like you don't do that.

45:11.560 --> 45:13.680
I don't want those people
to change you, Nadia.

45:14.000 --> 45:16.440
And I don't want you to disappoint
your mother and me.

45:21.520 --> 45:23.360
We have sacrificed a lot for you two.

45:24.200 --> 45:26.480
Don't make us feel we made a mistake.

45:27.160 --> 45:28.120
No more lies.

45:32.040 --> 45:33.280
Don't you have to study?

45:33.560 --> 45:35.560
There is no power or strength saved
in Allah.

45:36.920 --> 45:38.640
Omar, leave me alone, I have to study.

45:39.920 --> 45:42.000
WOULD YOU LIKE TO MEET TOMORROW?

45:43.280 --> 45:44.160
I'M REALLY BUSY

45:51.960 --> 45:54.360
You don't have it?
You said you would get it.

45:54.440 --> 45:56.920
I couldn't do it.
I'm not going to rob her father.

45:57.000 --> 46:00.880
-You'd rather save her family than ours?
-I didn't do it because I like her.

46:01.480 --> 46:02.680
I really like Marina.

46:03.400 --> 46:04.880
You dumbshit!

46:05.560 --> 46:07.760
You have no shot with her. Samu!

46:07.840 --> 46:08.680
What?

46:11.400 --> 46:14.280
You're screwing me over for a girl
who doesn't care about you.

46:14.480 --> 46:15.720
You are an idiot!

46:18.520 --> 46:21.640
<i>Guys, I got all your projects in my inbox,</i>

46:21.720 --> 46:24.200
<i>and I wanted to thank you.</i>
<i>I'm very happy with them.</i>

46:25.000 --> 46:27.280
<i>I imagine you've realized this was</i>

46:27.360 --> 46:30.680
a very important project
to get to know ourselves better,

46:30.960 --> 46:36.160
and to find out what it is
that we want others to know about us.

46:36.600 --> 46:38.480
What is the image we want to project?

46:38.840 --> 46:40.760
What is it we hide from others?

46:41.680 --> 46:42.920
Are we really...

46:43.760 --> 46:47.800
what others believe we are,
or do they only see our best side?

46:48.200 --> 46:50.200
You want me to tell you
what Marina was like?

46:51.440 --> 46:52.280
Marina was light.

46:55.240 --> 46:56.280
Marina was...

46:57.800 --> 47:00.440
one of those people
you meet on a Monday and...

47:01.120 --> 47:02.440
you want to look in the face,

47:02.520 --> 47:04.760
because she will smile
and brighten your day.

47:11.560 --> 47:13.200
Do you have any more questions?

47:14.240 --> 47:15.080
Guzmán...

47:17.680 --> 47:21.320
Maybe there's one thing
you didn't know about your sister.

47:26.800 --> 47:27.640
Look.

47:29.480 --> 47:31.840
We got the autopsy results.

47:33.000 --> 47:34.080
She was pregnant.

48:51.400 --> 48:54.160
