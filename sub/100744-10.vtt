00:11.000 --> 00:13.200
[Uhtred] <i>I am Uhtred, son of Uhtred.</i>

00:13.800 --> 00:17.000
<i>Eardwulf has led the Danes</i>
<i>to the greatest prize.</i>

00:17.080 --> 00:21.320
After Tettenhall, Edward believes
the Danes no longer hold a threat.

00:21.400 --> 00:24.680
He’s taken his army to Aegelesburg,
leaving Winchester undefended.

00:26.400 --> 00:29.160
-[groans]
-[screaming]

00:29.440 --> 00:32.720
[Uhtred] <i>But Sigtryggr sees the truth</i>
<i>of his dark heart.</i>

00:32.800 --> 00:35.400
So, let this man's fate
serve as a warning.

00:35.960 --> 00:37.680
[grunts]

00:37.759 --> 00:39.440
[Uhtred] <i>Haesten has entrapped me</i>

00:39.520 --> 00:43.800
<i>and I have lost those under my protection,</i>
<i>even my daughter Stiorra.</i>

00:45.240 --> 00:47.840
<i>And now the king's sons are held captive.</i>

00:48.240 --> 00:49.400
Don’t let them kill us!

00:49.880 --> 00:51.840
Both my heirs!

00:51.920 --> 00:56.400
[Uhtred] <i>In Edward’s absence, the Danes</i>
<i>strengthen their grasp on Winchester.</i>

00:56.480 --> 00:58.360
Lady Aelswith! [spits]

00:58.840 --> 00:59.960
[groans]

01:00.320 --> 01:01.280
[groans]

01:02.960 --> 01:05.600
Raise the Fyrd! Raise the Mercian Guard!

01:05.680 --> 01:09.560
[Uhtred] <i>The king is rash</i>
<i>in his determination to retake the town</i>

01:09.640 --> 01:11.720
<i>and will not listen to reason.</i>

01:11.800 --> 01:13.160
Do not do this!

01:13.240 --> 01:15.160
-Attack!
-No!

01:15.240 --> 01:18.040
[army roars and yells]

01:18.920 --> 01:20.480
[Uhtred] <i>Destiny is all!</i>

01:38.880 --> 01:41.240
[rats squeak]

02:34.080 --> 02:38.000
[horse neighs and men chatter
in background]

02:58.560 --> 03:01.840
-[Uhtred] Has he gone mad?
-Leave him. He will not listen.

03:01.920 --> 03:05.080
-You must tell him he is being foolish.
-I have tried. He is not himself.

03:07.640 --> 03:10.640
Be kind, Uhtred.
He is at heart a boy who is suffering.

03:14.160 --> 03:16.800
[breathes heavily]
Do you intend to set a fire?

03:16.880 --> 03:17.800
Yes.

03:18.320 --> 03:21.120
We encircle them and draw them out.

03:21.200 --> 03:22.920
Lord King, you should not do this.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
It is decided.

03:25.080 --> 03:27.440
The town walls cannot be breached
another way.

03:28.480 --> 03:30.520
Our attempts to attack have been futile.

03:31.000 --> 03:34.560
The Danes show no sign of surrender.
Perhaps this will force their hand.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.800
The fire will catch
and the town will be destroyed.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.640
Lord King, the heart of Wessex
will be burnt to ashes.

03:41.720 --> 03:44.840
And so the heathen burns in hell.
It is a risk I am resolved to.

03:45.480 --> 03:47.840
What are my choices, Uhtred? Surrender?

03:47.920 --> 03:50.560
Live in history as the King
who lost his lands?

03:50.640 --> 03:52.760
Thirty days we have tried and failed.

03:54.600 --> 03:59.040
I... I do this and in time Winchester will
rise again, stronger for her suffering.

03:59.120 --> 04:01.160
We should try again to speak
with Sigtryggr.

04:01.240 --> 04:03.320
This silence may be a sign
he looks for another way.

04:03.400 --> 04:05.000
They do not want to speak.

04:05.080 --> 04:07.200
We send men. They send arrows.

04:07.280 --> 04:09.920
We have asked them to leave
and now our patience wears thin!

04:10.000 --> 04:13.240
Yes and they will also be tired of this
and may be willing to negotiate.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.080
We are past negotiation.

04:15.160 --> 04:16.760
We win or they do!

04:16.840 --> 04:18.960
-Our families are prisoners--
-Aldhelm, what news?

04:19.640 --> 04:20.480
[sighs]

04:21.399 --> 04:23.760
Lady Aethelflaed sent me here
to tell of a great victory.

04:25.000 --> 04:28.480
She has taken Eoferwic and the Danes there
have submitted to her rule.

04:28.560 --> 04:30.440
She now travels south with her army.

04:31.600 --> 04:35.720
[inhales and exhales] Let her not be
shamed by weakness in her brother.

04:36.560 --> 04:40.240
Let her return to the land of her birth
and find it cleansed of the Danes.

04:41.080 --> 04:42.360
Tell them it is decided.

04:43.920 --> 04:46.920
If they do not surrender,
Winchester will burn!

05:31.440 --> 05:32.760
[Cenric] ...formation!

05:33.920 --> 05:34.920
Halt!

05:45.240 --> 05:47.200
[insects buzz]

05:50.440 --> 05:53.160
King Edward sends you this message
of intent!

05:57.120 --> 06:01.760
Leave the town,
or on his command, these flames will...

06:01.840 --> 06:02.840
[grunts]

06:02.920 --> 06:04.680
[angry murmuring]

06:04.760 --> 06:05.640
[groans]

06:08.680 --> 06:10.280
I knew what he was going to say.

06:11.120 --> 06:12.400
They’re getting desperate.

06:18.400 --> 06:19.240
[soldier groans]

06:21.000 --> 06:24.800
"755, Cynewulf and the West Saxons

06:24.880 --> 06:30.040
deprived Sigebert of his kingdom,
because of his unlawful deeds.

06:30.600 --> 06:33.760
Cynewulf often fought great battles
in Wealas."

06:34.680 --> 06:38.560
[sighs] Please, this is so dull.
I want to pull out my own eyes.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.120
Spoken like a true heathen.

06:41.440 --> 06:42.280
[sighs]

06:42.960 --> 06:46.400
Shall we play another game?
What was the tally again?

06:46.480 --> 06:48.040
I am not keeping count.

06:48.600 --> 06:49.640
Come, read.

06:50.120 --> 06:51.880
I’m too hungry to read.

06:58.280 --> 07:01.600
-Is this the last of the bread?
-I am not keeping count of that either.

07:01.680 --> 07:03.120
Do you still have the grain?

07:08.560 --> 07:11.520
I’m taking the girl.
We need to kill a hostage.

07:12.240 --> 07:14.720
-And she will get their attention.
-They threaten to use fire.

07:15.160 --> 07:17.360
And in response, we show no mercy.

07:18.360 --> 07:20.480
Then not her. She is worthless.

07:20.720 --> 07:22.320
Not to the Dane-Slayer.

07:22.800 --> 07:25.880
Sigtryggr,
I need Uhtred to come out and fight.

07:26.280 --> 07:27.840
This will force his hand.

07:28.920 --> 07:31.040
Is this true? Will your father attack us?

07:31.120 --> 07:33.080
If he does, he’ll destroy you.

07:33.560 --> 07:34.720
[grunts]

07:34.800 --> 07:36.400
Do not succumb to anger, Brida.

07:36.480 --> 07:38.960
Haesten, tell the men
to get clay and water.

07:39.040 --> 07:41.600
Dampen the roofs.
Protect the walls from fire.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.800
Then I will select a hostage...

07:46.480 --> 07:48.040
and we will see what they do.

07:49.600 --> 07:50.440
Hm?

07:52.840 --> 07:55.120
-[Dane] Hurry up, men!
-[excited murmuring]

07:55.200 --> 07:56.200
Make haste!

07:57.320 --> 07:59.040
[indistinct chattering]

07:59.120 --> 07:59.960
[Dane] Take it.

08:17.880 --> 08:18.720
[Haesten] Here.

08:18.800 --> 08:19.880
[Eadith gasps softly]

08:23.360 --> 08:25.400
There is some water in a flask here.

08:26.160 --> 08:28.200
[Eadith] But what are you doing?

08:29.040 --> 08:30.920
Don’t worry. I will look after you.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.840
-Where is the water?
-You finished it.

08:43.919 --> 08:45.400
We must pray they offer more.

08:45.960 --> 08:48.320
-[Aelflaed] I am...
-Please do not say it again.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.600
We know you are hungry.

08:50.480 --> 08:53.280
She is not accustomed to discomfort.

08:53.360 --> 08:56.960
Discomfort! This is nothing compared
to what we endured in the marshland.

08:57.560 --> 08:59.320
Just be grateful there are no flies.

08:59.840 --> 09:02.040
I am grateful there is no screaming.

09:02.640 --> 09:05.240
[Aelswith] I fear that is
because everyone is dead.

09:05.560 --> 09:09.400
We are being kept alive,
so they can make a show of our deaths.

09:09.960 --> 09:13.040
Then if they try to take me,
I shall throw myself upon their knives.

09:15.280 --> 09:17.840
I can show you a way
with a piece of cloth.

09:20.600 --> 09:23.760
I have learned things in my life,
which you do not know.

09:30.440 --> 09:31.280
[sighs]

09:34.720 --> 09:38.280
There is a plant
that flowers in the courtyard.

09:39.760 --> 09:43.720
The purple blooms,
when dissolved in water, are tasteless...

09:44.880 --> 09:45.920
and effective...

09:47.000 --> 09:48.280
especially in children.

09:51.720 --> 09:54.080
Why would such a plant grow
in the courtyard?

09:56.800 --> 10:00.840
It was planted there,
should this situation ever arise.

10:03.280 --> 10:05.040
[door is unlocked]

10:09.640 --> 10:10.680
[door slams]

10:20.200 --> 10:21.920
Give me the King's heir.

10:23.160 --> 10:24.080
Come here, boy.

10:24.160 --> 10:28.400
No! That child is the King's first born.
He does not care for my son. Take him.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.000
Foolish.

10:30.640 --> 10:34.320
He will assume you are lying
and take Aelfweard anyway.

10:35.480 --> 10:36.480
Are you lying?

10:36.680 --> 10:38.680
[breathes heavily]

10:39.800 --> 10:41.280
[softly] I do not know.

10:41.680 --> 10:42.720
[sighs]

10:43.320 --> 10:46.320
Which of these two children
is more precious to his heart?

10:46.920 --> 10:49.280
I'm the elder brother. I should be chosen.

10:54.040 --> 10:55.440
I will take them both.

11:03.440 --> 11:06.280
[distant neigh of horses]

11:07.840 --> 11:09.560
Do not give the signal.

11:09.640 --> 11:12.200
You must see how this plan
unleashes pointless slaughter.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.840
Each hour we wait is an insult
to my father!

11:14.920 --> 11:17.480
-Then think of the captives.
-They are lost to us!

11:18.080 --> 11:21.000
They were lost from the moment
the Danes arrived in Wessex.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.080
Do you not see it?

11:22.560 --> 11:24.040
This is my punishment.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.400
I abandoned the children of Mercia

11:26.480 --> 11:28.520
and this is God's vengeance
for that mistake.

11:28.600 --> 11:30.160
God would not do that, Lord.

11:30.240 --> 11:32.360
We do not have to burn Winchester!

11:32.720 --> 11:34.920
I swear to you I will find another way.

11:35.920 --> 11:38.040
And you always keep to your word, Uhtred.

11:40.480 --> 11:41.840
[Father Pyrlig sighs]

11:42.880 --> 11:45.600
I will get in, find this Sigtryggr and--

11:45.680 --> 11:48.640
How?
We built those walls never to be breached.

11:48.720 --> 11:50.960
So far, they've been more steadfast
than any of us.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.160
[young Uhtred] Father!

11:53.280 --> 11:54.440
Uhtred?

11:54.720 --> 11:56.320
[pants]

11:56.400 --> 11:58.480
-What are you doing here?
-Where is she?

11:58.560 --> 12:00.040
[pants]

12:00.600 --> 12:01.880
Where is Stiorra?

12:01.960 --> 12:04.240
She is within,
but we have a plan to save her.

12:04.320 --> 12:07.640
[horn blows]

12:07.720 --> 12:10.280
[Sigtryggr] King Edward of Wessex!

12:13.480 --> 12:14.480
[soldier] Make ready

12:15.600 --> 12:18.480
[Sigtryggr] King Edward of Wessex!

12:18.880 --> 12:22.440
I have shown myself. Do the same.

12:26.360 --> 12:30.320
Approach the gate
and meet me face to face!

12:31.680 --> 12:34.560
[inhales] I will not take
orders from a Dane.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.840
[Sigtryggr] Let us talk, eye to eye!

12:38.920 --> 12:41.480
[Edward inhales]
This is a game and I will not play.

12:42.760 --> 12:46.360
Tell him to surrender, or I will give
the signal to burn them all.

12:49.440 --> 12:50.480
Bring the boys.

12:56.480 --> 12:57.400
Lord King!

13:09.920 --> 13:11.480
Lower your weapons!

13:14.480 --> 13:15.320
Come!

13:15.800 --> 13:18.160
Talk to us at the gate!

13:22.800 --> 13:23.800
Come now!

13:24.560 --> 13:26.440
Your sons want to see their father!

13:29.560 --> 13:31.920
Lord, do not approach the gate.

13:57.000 --> 14:01.480
Give me my children,
or I will find yours and take their eyes.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.560
I have no children.

14:05.200 --> 14:06.200
Nor a wife.

14:07.280 --> 14:09.040
This is why I'm stronger than you.

14:10.680 --> 14:12.040
Give me my children!

14:14.000 --> 14:15.280
I command it.

14:15.760 --> 14:17.240
[Sigtryggr chuckles]

14:17.880 --> 14:21.280
[Sigtryggr] I will give you
one of your sons if you retreat.

14:21.560 --> 14:23.120
And you may choose which.

14:46.040 --> 14:49.200
[distorted yell]

14:52.040 --> 14:54.080
[breathes heavily]

14:54.160 --> 14:55.320
Someone speak.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.200
[breathes heavily]

14:57.640 --> 14:58.800
What do I do?

15:01.920 --> 15:03.240
Request the aetheling.

15:03.680 --> 15:07.120
If I choose one child, what happens
to the other...? [voice cracks]

15:07.200 --> 15:08.800
It is a hard decision, yes.

15:09.400 --> 15:10.800
But I think it is part

15:10.880 --> 15:13.720
of a longer strategy to see
if you will negotiate.

15:13.800 --> 15:17.920
I... I have looked that man in the eye
and he is not one to give ground.

15:18.000 --> 15:19.480
[breathes heavily]

15:21.800 --> 15:22.840
What do you think?

15:25.680 --> 15:27.440
That if we show weakness now...

15:28.480 --> 15:31.080
he will make a show of cruelty.

15:31.160 --> 15:32.000
[exhales sharply]

15:32.080 --> 15:33.640
[Aldhelm] I think say nothing.

15:35.440 --> 15:36.400
Can we pay him?

15:36.480 --> 15:40.040
[exhales] He doesn’t want silver.
If he did, he would have taken it--

15:40.120 --> 15:42.480
He wants to destroy us
and destroy our spirit.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.800
[breathes heavily]

15:47.480 --> 15:49.680
I cannot do this. I can...

15:50.720 --> 15:54.320
I can... I cannot... I cannot.
I cannot do this.

16:01.080 --> 16:02.120
What would you do?

16:07.160 --> 16:08.640
Much the same as him.

16:10.000 --> 16:11.360
Be broken by it.

16:12.080 --> 16:13.240
Any man would.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.120
It is unnatural to have to choose
between your children.

16:16.200 --> 16:17.960
I would want you to pick Stiorra.

16:18.520 --> 16:20.640
I could defend myself
if it happened to us.

16:20.720 --> 16:22.280
It will not happen to us.

16:23.960 --> 16:25.720
And it will not happen to the King.

16:27.640 --> 16:29.840
Are you going to do something foolish?

16:29.920 --> 16:31.080
Are you going stop me?

16:37.480 --> 16:39.440
-[Edward exhales]
-Then you should be pragmatic...

16:40.160 --> 16:42.720
and choose the son
whose legitimacy is not in question.

16:42.800 --> 16:45.840
I cannot. I cannot be the man
to condemn one son over the other.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.600
There must be something else he wants.

16:48.680 --> 16:49.840
[Uhtred] He wants me dead.

16:52.960 --> 16:54.760
This much I know from Haesten.

16:56.480 --> 17:01.040
He would not trade you for my sons. You...
You are not that valuable to me, Uhtred.

17:02.400 --> 17:03.320
True.

17:04.560 --> 17:06.360
But I do have a value to the Danes.

17:06.840 --> 17:09.839
To kill the man they call the Dane-Slayer
would bring great reputation.

17:09.920 --> 17:10.960
He might want that.

17:12.119 --> 17:15.000
And Brida will want revenge
for her enslavement in Wealas.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.720
Let me offer myself. It is worth trying.

17:24.720 --> 17:27.280
Then Wessex would once again
be in your debt.

17:29.560 --> 17:31.000
[Edward breathes heavily]

17:33.480 --> 17:39.040
And should you not return, I will ensure
they speak of your honor through the ages.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.000
Uhtred will not be forgotten.

17:45.440 --> 17:46.640
This is a brave plan.

17:47.480 --> 17:48.560
Which plan is that?

17:48.640 --> 17:49.800
He doesn't have a plan.

17:49.880 --> 17:52.000
This is what he looks like
when he's making it up.

17:52.080 --> 17:53.920
You cannot hope to take them
on single-handed?

17:54.000 --> 17:55.760
What do you think he's doing, then?

17:55.840 --> 17:57.640
I presume
you’re trying to get us some time.

17:58.440 --> 18:00.680
If you can delay the Danes
until Lady Aethelflaed arrives,

18:00.760 --> 18:03.320
she will persuade Edward
to endure a longer siege.

18:03.400 --> 18:05.760
You know that we can take back the town
when they’re depleted.

18:06.800 --> 18:09.440
-That is not my plan, Aldhelm.
-Ha! Told you.

18:10.240 --> 18:12.040
Why else would you make
such a dangerous offer?

18:15.440 --> 18:17.240
Because I believe I can end this.

18:21.000 --> 18:22.000
[Uhtred sighs]

18:44.440 --> 18:45.480
[Uhtred] Sigtryggr!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.200
Show yourself!

18:52.200 --> 18:53.560
But I killed him...

18:54.040 --> 18:55.120
What?

18:55.200 --> 18:56.040
We...

18:56.560 --> 18:58.040
We have tried to kill him.

18:59.880 --> 19:01.840
And yet here he is...

19:02.720 --> 19:06.040
returned from the dead,
like their nailed god.

19:06.120 --> 19:07.040
[sighs]

19:07.560 --> 19:09.360
And not for the first time, I hear.

19:11.480 --> 19:14.480
I have learned a lot about him
from his daughter.

19:15.800 --> 19:17.800
[Uhtred] We will not retreat, Sigtryggr!

19:18.280 --> 19:19.960
Instead, we make you this offer.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.320
Send out both the children...

19:23.000 --> 19:26.560
and I will walk into Winchester alone.

19:29.120 --> 19:32.040
[Sigtryggr] And why would I exchange gold
for silver?

19:33.040 --> 19:35.960
Because you will have
the Saxons' greatest warrior!

19:36.640 --> 19:38.120
[chuckles]

19:38.480 --> 19:41.200
And because you know
that, in time, I would kill you...

19:41.480 --> 19:43.840
as I have killed your friends
and your brothers.

19:44.400 --> 19:45.600
Is he lying?

19:47.000 --> 19:47.880
No.

19:50.080 --> 19:51.680
What his daughter said is true.

19:52.680 --> 19:54.880
We cannot conquer this place
while he lives.

19:57.480 --> 19:59.280
Edward can make other heirs.

20:00.120 --> 20:01.720
He cannot make another Uhtred.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.720
[chuckles]

20:07.040 --> 20:09.240
Then perhaps we should tear him to pieces.

20:11.880 --> 20:13.120
Make the exchange.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.400
[low murmuring]

21:52.280 --> 21:53.560
How long do we give him?

21:56.200 --> 21:57.360
As long as he needs.

22:01.320 --> 22:02.880
We’ll know when the time comes.

22:23.240 --> 22:24.240
[grunts]

22:25.960 --> 22:28.600
Your king could not choose
between his sons.

22:33.560 --> 22:34.680
And so...

22:35.600 --> 22:37.600
Guards, bring in the prisoner!

22:39.880 --> 22:44.280
He has given us his greatest warrior
in their place!

22:52.840 --> 22:53.840
Bring him to me.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.800
I did not know about the child.

23:11.280 --> 23:12.560
Neither did Cnut.

23:15.480 --> 23:19.080
All will be avenged
when you suffer as I have suffered.

23:20.160 --> 23:22.960
Tie him to the crucifix
in the marketplace!

23:23.560 --> 23:26.720
Let him die like the Christian
he tries to be!

23:29.000 --> 23:30.880
-In time, Brida.
-Huh?

23:30.960 --> 23:34.280
-[Sigtryggr] Take him to the hall.
-[Brida] What? Sigtryggr...

23:34.760 --> 23:36.960
Sigtryggr! We agreed.

23:37.840 --> 23:40.800
I swear that you shall have him
when I am finished with him.

23:41.600 --> 23:42.600
On my honor.

23:44.080 --> 23:45.280
His sword.

23:50.960 --> 23:53.680
Return the captives to the chapel
and feed them.

23:54.080 --> 23:55.320
I need them alive...

23:57.040 --> 23:58.080
for now.

24:00.720 --> 24:01.920
Do you like this?

24:03.720 --> 24:04.920
Then I need your help.

24:05.640 --> 24:08.000
[Brida] I don’t want his sword!
I want him!

24:08.080 --> 24:10.720
-You’ll have your revenge, Brida.
-Sigtryggr!

24:32.360 --> 24:33.240
Hm.

24:34.880 --> 24:36.200
What does this mean?

24:36.760 --> 24:38.360
Why this sudden kindness?

24:38.440 --> 24:39.920
Sigtryggr toys with us.

24:40.400 --> 24:43.400
Whether it means a reprieve,
I do not know.

24:43.480 --> 24:45.840
Well, the children are safe.

24:46.440 --> 24:47.600
That is enough for now.

24:48.800 --> 24:51.000
Let us break bread and be thankful.

24:55.720 --> 24:58.080
Drink enough water,
then give me back the jug.

24:58.160 --> 25:00.200
After that point, do not drink anymore.

25:01.720 --> 25:02.680
Why?

25:03.400 --> 25:06.040
If the King cannot choose
between his sons,

25:06.120 --> 25:07.880
it may be that we need to ensure

25:07.960 --> 25:11.560
Aethelstan does not have
a powerful friend.

25:26.160 --> 25:27.280
[door opens]

25:29.280 --> 25:31.400
[grunts]

25:35.320 --> 25:36.400
[grunts]

25:39.720 --> 25:41.000
You are fast.

25:41.480 --> 25:43.080
I think you are not trying.

25:43.160 --> 25:46.480
Why would I not try? When you are
the killer of so many of my kin?

25:46.560 --> 25:48.920
That is a question only you can answer.

25:53.040 --> 25:55.680
Perhaps your reputation is exaggerated.

25:58.800 --> 26:00.840
I've been reading his chronicle.

26:02.920 --> 26:04.360
You are not in it.

26:05.760 --> 26:09.200
Alfred did not want it known
how much he owed to a heathen.

26:09.280 --> 26:10.680
[chuckles]

26:11.720 --> 26:15.160
If you are not of their God,
then why do you choose them?

26:17.840 --> 26:20.400
-They are my people.
-And they accept you as such?

26:20.480 --> 26:22.160
Many heathens live here in peace.

26:22.240 --> 26:24.320
It is only the Kings
who cannot find accord.

26:24.400 --> 26:25.240
Oh.

26:26.800 --> 26:27.760
Interesting.

26:28.720 --> 26:30.840
Your daughter, she said the same.

26:31.560 --> 26:32.560
Where is she?

26:32.640 --> 26:33.880
She is here.

26:34.640 --> 26:36.240
She’s been well-treated.

26:37.480 --> 26:40.640
Hm, I see the Dane in her.

26:42.680 --> 26:45.400
She has not been dishonored,
I swear to that.

26:46.080 --> 26:50.320
No, your daughter
is a very intelligent young woman...

26:50.880 --> 26:53.000
which she apparently gets from her mother.

26:53.320 --> 26:54.880
We've talked a great deal.

26:56.240 --> 26:57.920
She has told me much about you...

26:58.400 --> 27:01.160
how you fought for peace in Mercia...

27:01.640 --> 27:04.280
how you gave up the woman you loved.

27:04.360 --> 27:10.560
But my favorite tale was how
you lost your home at Bebbanburg.

27:10.640 --> 27:11.920
Why is that of interest?

27:12.000 --> 27:14.120
Because I too have lost a home.

27:15.760 --> 27:20.880
And, so, I wonder
if that puts us on common ground.

27:26.960 --> 27:28.360
Do you wish to strike a bargain?

27:30.040 --> 27:31.800
Is that why you have not killed me?

27:31.880 --> 27:33.080
[Sigtryggr chuckles]

27:33.720 --> 27:35.040
Why not approach the King?

27:35.120 --> 27:40.280
Because the King is not a decisive man
and men like that, they cannot negotiate.

27:40.360 --> 27:44.480
You, on the other hand, you offered
your lover to preserve a kingdom.

27:44.960 --> 27:47.600
So, I presume
you can make difficult choices.

27:48.240 --> 27:49.080
Hm?

27:50.440 --> 27:54.280
-But I have nothing to give.
-But you have influence with those who do.

27:56.480 --> 27:58.040
And they follow you.

28:00.320 --> 28:01.920
What is it you want?

28:02.000 --> 28:02.880
Peace.

28:03.800 --> 28:05.600
Or peace and land.

28:06.080 --> 28:08.440
And you try to find peace
by starting a war?

28:10.000 --> 28:11.160
Where is the battle?

28:12.680 --> 28:14.240
Where is the war?

28:16.960 --> 28:19.000
I guessed you wanted to negotiate.

28:19.480 --> 28:21.440
The king would not believe it.

28:21.520 --> 28:24.520
Who told you that I would be willing
to strike a bargain?

28:24.960 --> 28:26.520
Oh, you did...

28:27.800 --> 28:29.600
when you chose to enter the town.

28:31.600 --> 28:33.600
The offer had been made.

28:34.160 --> 28:37.120
All we have to do is get Edward
to agree to a meeting...

28:37.480 --> 28:38.800
and argue the terms.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.800
[Brida] Haesten! Are you spying on them?

28:41.880 --> 28:43.920
[Uhtred and Sigtryggr chat in distance]

28:44.240 --> 28:45.480
I spy on everyone.

28:47.120 --> 28:48.600
What is he doing with him?

28:49.160 --> 28:50.200
I fear to tell you.

28:50.280 --> 28:52.120
Haesten, what’s happening in there?

28:53.760 --> 28:54.600
[clears throat]

28:55.920 --> 28:56.920
You should know...

28:57.800 --> 28:59.360
Sigtryggr seeks a truce.

29:00.000 --> 29:00.960
[exhales]

29:02.200 --> 29:03.880
That is a good thing, Brida.

29:04.360 --> 29:06.160
It means more land, more silver.

29:09.800 --> 29:11.000
It means betrayal.

29:11.080 --> 29:12.680
You are foolish.

29:15.200 --> 29:16.400
This could soon be over.

29:20.920 --> 29:22.120
Cowards.

29:22.200 --> 29:24.000
Liars and cowards all of you!

29:24.920 --> 29:28.200
Go in the north. You need good weather
to go through there.

29:28.280 --> 29:29.880
Why don’t you go up to Eoferwic?

29:57.840 --> 30:01.840
Well, I don’t think this is going to work.

30:08.240 --> 30:09.240
[yells angrily]

30:30.400 --> 30:32.200
[birdsong]

31:07.400 --> 31:10.400
[Osferth] Do not lose faith.
He will have survived.

31:13.480 --> 31:14.320
[sighs]

31:16.880 --> 31:17.720
[man] Lord.

31:18.760 --> 31:21.320
No, I'm begging, Lord King,
just give him more time.

31:21.400 --> 31:23.760
Do not attack whilst he is within.
Please, Lord.

31:23.840 --> 31:25.800
-This does not mean the end.
-[man] My Lord.

31:25.880 --> 31:28.480
Lord King,
we have followed Uhtred for years.

31:28.560 --> 31:29.480
He’s never failed!

31:29.560 --> 31:31.920
He never failed
because good men followed him.

31:33.560 --> 31:34.480
[sighs]

31:34.560 --> 31:37.200
But even he could not take on
an army alone.

31:37.560 --> 31:38.760
It was unwise.

31:39.360 --> 31:44.200
It is painful to speak it, but your Lord
has lost a battle he could never win.

31:49.760 --> 31:51.040
There is no hope for him.

32:19.480 --> 32:22.120
[Pyrlig] Lord King!
Our scouts send good news!

32:23.400 --> 32:25.960
The Lady of Mercia has come.
She brings an army!

32:35.160 --> 32:37.920
The King is trying to be bold,
but his decisions are rash.

32:38.000 --> 32:41.040
I'm certain that with more time,
the siege can be ended without slaughter.

32:41.120 --> 32:43.200
Edward, I have heard the boys
have been freed.

32:43.280 --> 32:47.160
One mercy has been shown, yes.
I hear Danes have submitted in the north.

32:47.240 --> 32:49.880
Yes. And what has been done once
can be done twice.

32:50.360 --> 32:53.960
If you have your sons, you have everything
you need for Alfred's line to thrive.

32:54.560 --> 32:57.480
Walls can be rebuilt, palaces, even tombs.

32:58.280 --> 33:00.040
Edward, you are Wessex.

33:00.400 --> 33:02.760
Whatever you decide,
Mercia will support you.

33:04.080 --> 33:07.240
He cannot lose Winchester.
It would rip out our father's heart.

33:07.320 --> 33:09.240
We should not put it above
the lives of innocents.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.040
-No, Aethelflaed is right.
-How many people are within?

33:12.120 --> 33:14.760
Many. And there are those,
of course, inside of royal blood,

33:14.840 --> 33:15.880
my wife, our mother.

33:16.600 --> 33:18.720
Mother would not want you to capitulate.

33:18.800 --> 33:21.720
She is by father's side
and will be reconciled to dying.

33:21.800 --> 33:24.760
[sighs] Then we shall proceed,
but not as they expect.

33:24.840 --> 33:30.280
They have made provisions against fire,
so, let us use smoke to conceal an attack.

33:30.360 --> 33:31.840
If God and the winds are in our favor,

33:31.920 --> 33:34.680
it will choke those guarding the gates
and allow us to breach the walls.

33:34.760 --> 33:37.440
But if the wind turns,
then we ourselves are smothered.

33:37.520 --> 33:38.360
Lady, I beg you.

33:38.440 --> 33:41.080
-Give Lord Uhtred more time.
-Lord Uhtred is already dead.

33:50.000 --> 33:52.480
Dead or alive, it does not matter.

33:53.520 --> 33:57.440
We cannot hand Winchester
over to the Danes for the life of one man.

33:57.920 --> 33:59.120
[Edward] Indeed.

33:59.480 --> 34:01.880
Set the hay sacks close to the gates.

34:01.960 --> 34:05.320
Add shit and lime,
so they may choke on the stench.

34:05.400 --> 34:08.120
We force men from the ramparts
and into the streets,

34:08.200 --> 34:10.240
breach the gates and slaughter them!

34:10.320 --> 34:12.200
[men shout and chatter in background]

34:57.120 --> 34:57.960
[screams]

34:59.800 --> 35:01.400
[screams]

35:04.480 --> 35:05.320
[groans]

35:10.960 --> 35:12.960
[yelling and screaming]

35:21.000 --> 35:22.040
Here.

35:22.840 --> 35:23.760
[pants]

35:24.560 --> 35:25.560
Are you leaving?

35:25.640 --> 35:26.480
Yes.

35:27.720 --> 35:30.920
They are at the gates and I do not want
to be here for the fight.

35:32.360 --> 35:36.280
-And you are coming with me.
-No. No, no, I cannot.

35:40.040 --> 35:42.760
-[grunts and whimpers]
-They will be slaughtered!

35:42.840 --> 35:44.200
[breathes heavily]

35:44.280 --> 35:46.640
-[distant roar of battle]
-[breathes heavily]

35:47.200 --> 35:48.240
Come with me.

35:48.920 --> 35:52.360
Many women have grown to appreciate
my charms, given a year or so.

35:52.440 --> 35:54.240
[pants and groans]

35:55.320 --> 35:57.360
[roaring and yelling]

36:08.400 --> 36:10.000
[grunting and gasping]

36:10.080 --> 36:11.200
[guard] Get back!

36:11.280 --> 36:13.280
[grunting and gasping]

36:16.960 --> 36:18.280
[gags and vomits]

36:18.360 --> 36:19.280
[splatter of vomit]

36:19.360 --> 36:20.800
[gags and coughs]

36:20.880 --> 36:24.480
[horn blows in background]

36:28.200 --> 36:29.240
Down there.

36:29.320 --> 36:30.240
[grunts softly]

36:31.600 --> 36:33.080
-Will we get out?
-Yes!

36:33.560 --> 36:35.440
Save yourself from what will follow.

36:35.520 --> 36:36.360
[Eadith] No!

36:36.440 --> 36:38.360
You will not survive the fight!

36:38.720 --> 36:40.000
We have no time for this!

36:40.080 --> 36:41.480
Stay and you die!

36:41.560 --> 36:43.120
My place is with the captives!

36:43.200 --> 36:45.920
Ah, die, then, ungrateful bitch!

36:46.320 --> 36:47.760
[breathes heavily]

36:52.440 --> 36:54.040
Edward has attacked us.

36:54.120 --> 36:55.120
Come with me.

36:57.480 --> 36:58.480
Uhtred.

36:59.600 --> 37:01.960
You betray me, all will suffer.

37:02.040 --> 37:03.840
[inhales deeply and exhales]

37:07.320 --> 37:10.480
[men yell and roar]

37:19.920 --> 37:21.200
Quickly! Get back!

37:28.080 --> 37:29.640
One formation!

37:29.720 --> 37:32.320
[grunting and yelling]

37:35.880 --> 37:39.480
[horn blows]

37:45.080 --> 37:46.800
[roar of men yelling]

37:46.880 --> 37:48.080
[whistle of arrows]

37:59.120 --> 38:02.200
Pull back! Protect your men! Keep tight!

38:02.760 --> 38:05.480
[Eadith grunts and pants]

38:05.960 --> 38:07.280
[Eadith whimpers]

38:07.360 --> 38:09.360
[roar of men yelling]

38:29.040 --> 38:30.440
[yells ferociously]

38:49.640 --> 38:50.920
[grunting]

38:51.720 --> 38:54.560
Let me speak with him.
Let me speak with the King.

38:55.120 --> 38:58.720
Go with this man.
If he kills Danes, kill him.

39:21.760 --> 39:22.800
[grunting]

39:24.000 --> 39:25.720
Stand down your men!

39:26.120 --> 39:28.120
Edward, stand down!

39:28.200 --> 39:29.520
Stand down!

39:44.080 --> 39:45.360
Edward!

39:46.480 --> 39:48.400
Edward! Edward!

39:48.480 --> 39:50.720
[indistinct yelling and grunting]

39:50.800 --> 39:54.880
Lord, you must trust me! I spoke to him.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.000
Edward, stop this fight!

40:00.360 --> 40:02.160
[indistinct yelling]

40:02.240 --> 40:04.200
-It's too late!
-Trust me!

40:04.280 --> 40:07.160
Sigtryggr is willing to negotiate!
Why would I lie to you?

40:07.240 --> 40:09.400
I have spoken to him. He will stand down!

40:09.480 --> 40:11.040
Winchester is going to burn!

40:11.480 --> 40:14.640
Sigtryggr! Stand down your men!

40:14.720 --> 40:17.040
Order the shield wall! Do it now!

40:20.480 --> 40:22.600
Did you get what you came for?

40:22.920 --> 40:25.560
Sigtryggr! Stand down your men!

40:28.840 --> 40:30.840
You can get what you came for!

40:33.400 --> 40:35.760
Shield wall!

40:38.360 --> 40:39.760
[blows]

40:40.480 --> 40:41.680
[yelling]

40:44.760 --> 40:47.880
Shield wall!

40:48.880 --> 40:51.240
[horn blows]

40:51.320 --> 40:55.800
Shield wall!

41:03.000 --> 41:05.720
[Eadith yells and whimpers]

41:05.800 --> 41:06.920
[Finan] Get back!

41:07.640 --> 41:09.760
[guard] Hold the line! Back!

41:10.280 --> 41:11.240
-Dear God!
-[groaning]

41:11.320 --> 41:12.160
Stay back!

41:12.680 --> 41:13.680
Please.

41:17.560 --> 41:19.440
-[Eadith groans]
-Eadith. Eadith.

41:19.720 --> 41:20.640
[Dane] Stay back.

41:20.720 --> 41:22.360
-[Uhtred] Finan!
-[groaning]

41:22.760 --> 41:24.560
She's all right. Come on.

41:24.840 --> 41:25.760
[Uhtred] Move!

41:26.880 --> 41:29.600
-[Finan] Get back! Get back!
-[Uhtred] Move!

41:30.920 --> 41:34.800
-Hold the line! Hold the lines!
-[Dane] You heard him!

41:35.640 --> 41:37.400
[panting]

41:41.720 --> 41:44.080
[breathes heavily]

41:48.720 --> 41:52.000
[Edward] Sigtryggr,
you wish to talk with us?

41:53.320 --> 41:56.440
There will be no negotiation
until we see the captives.

42:00.600 --> 42:01.480
Welcome.

42:11.200 --> 42:13.400
[door is unlocked and opened]

42:40.560 --> 42:43.720
Uhtred tells me you have gone north.

42:45.560 --> 42:48.400
I want Eoferwic
and the lands that surround it.

42:48.480 --> 42:52.080
-No, we have just recaptured Eoferwic.
-Which is why I want it.

42:52.160 --> 42:54.400
For decades, we have fought
to push Danes from there.

42:54.480 --> 42:57.120
To give it to you
would set us back a generation.

42:57.200 --> 42:58.800
Then I will keep Winchester.

42:59.920 --> 43:00.760
[chuckles]

43:00.840 --> 43:02.560
We can offer you East Anglia.

43:02.640 --> 43:06.080
It is bigger and has access
to your homeland from the sea.

43:06.560 --> 43:07.720
I want Eoferwic.

43:07.800 --> 43:09.120
I cannot agree.

43:09.200 --> 43:11.280
[Sigtryggr] It is unclear
what your choices are.

43:16.040 --> 43:16.920
[sighs]

43:17.000 --> 43:20.600
-Perhaps we should consider it.
-[Aethelflaed] He would be on my border!

43:22.120 --> 43:24.360
Edward, do not let him divide us.

43:24.680 --> 43:27.000
I will leave you to trade
between yourselves.

43:27.080 --> 43:28.400
I’ll find my daughter.

43:42.120 --> 43:42.960
[groans]

43:44.480 --> 43:45.560
[yells ferociously]

43:45.640 --> 43:46.800
[groans]

43:46.880 --> 43:48.320
Did you think I would forget you?

43:48.400 --> 43:49.920
Stop this! It is over.

43:50.000 --> 43:51.480
It is never over.

43:51.560 --> 43:53.520
[yells ferociously and grunts]

43:53.920 --> 43:56.680
Brida! I spared your life!

43:56.760 --> 43:58.560
You destroyed my life!

43:58.640 --> 44:00.600
You know nothing of how I suffered!

44:00.920 --> 44:03.040
I will not kill you, nor Cnut's child.

44:03.120 --> 44:06.240
He is not Cnut's. He is mine alone!

44:06.320 --> 44:09.720
And he will be loyal to me,
as no man ever has!

44:09.800 --> 44:12.600
I will breed in him
a hatred of all Saxons.

44:12.680 --> 44:16.080
Then you condemn your child
to a bloody death and that will undo you!

44:16.160 --> 44:18.400
[grunts and pants]

44:19.520 --> 44:22.680
[grunts angrily and groans]

44:24.320 --> 44:25.360
[both grunt]

44:26.120 --> 44:27.760
Fight on and they will kill you!

44:27.840 --> 44:29.960
[breathes heavily]

44:30.040 --> 44:32.360
If not the Saxon kings,
then Sigtryggr himself.

44:32.760 --> 44:34.560
But I am not afraid of that.

44:35.240 --> 44:37.440
I have not lost faith in what comes after.

44:38.200 --> 44:39.480
Do it!

44:40.360 --> 44:41.520
Do it!

44:41.600 --> 44:43.880
Kill me. [pants]

44:44.200 --> 44:46.200
If you do not, I will become stronger.

44:48.480 --> 44:50.680
Blood has been shed. More will flow.

44:51.440 --> 44:54.040
I will take revenge on all of those
who have betrayed me

44:54.120 --> 44:57.280
and I will not rest
until they suffer at my hand.

44:59.080 --> 45:00.920
[pants] Do it!

45:04.680 --> 45:06.080
Or I will be your undoing.

45:06.160 --> 45:07.920
[pants and laughs nervously]

45:15.080 --> 45:16.080
Just leave.

45:17.800 --> 45:18.920
Have your child.

45:21.600 --> 45:23.000
Leave while you can.

45:35.480 --> 45:37.320
[Uhtred] I never know where she is.

45:37.600 --> 45:38.720
Careful, Osferth!

45:44.080 --> 45:45.040
[Aethelflaed sighs]

45:45.560 --> 45:46.680
Have you struck a bargain?

45:48.320 --> 45:49.240
[clears throat]

45:49.320 --> 45:51.600
He... He will take Eoferwic...

45:52.160 --> 45:55.320
and agree never to enter Wessex,
Mercia or East Anglia.

45:55.400 --> 45:57.400
So, you hold three of the four Kingdoms.

45:58.880 --> 46:00.240
That is no humiliation.

46:04.000 --> 46:06.640
Sigtryggr would like to take
one of the captives.

46:07.400 --> 46:09.760
[breathes heavily]

46:10.400 --> 46:11.240
Your daughter.

46:13.880 --> 46:15.360
Which you have refused.

46:18.080 --> 46:21.280
Because you know what it is to have
your child used in a bargain!

46:22.720 --> 46:24.520
Stiorra is not a child.

46:26.360 --> 46:27.640
She is a young woman.

46:30.880 --> 46:32.480
So, we did not refuse.

46:48.920 --> 46:50.000
[gasps softly]

46:54.720 --> 46:56.480
I thought I'd lost you.

47:00.800 --> 47:01.800
I'll miss you.

47:06.760 --> 47:07.600
Why?

47:08.440 --> 47:09.560
When I leave.

47:10.800 --> 47:11.880
I have said no.

47:13.960 --> 47:16.320
But I'm... I'm willing to go.

47:17.960 --> 47:18.960
With Sigtryggr?

47:20.760 --> 47:24.640
-But I want you with me in Coccham.
-There’s nothing for me in Coccham.

47:24.720 --> 47:26.840
It’s the chance for us to be one family.

47:26.920 --> 47:28.920
It’s not what either of us wants.

47:29.560 --> 47:33.120
You’d like it to be true, but it’s not.
Your men are your family.

47:33.600 --> 47:35.520
I want my children with me.

47:35.600 --> 47:36.760
Maybe in Bebbanburg.

47:36.840 --> 47:40.640
Maybe then, but you’re not destined
to be the Lord of Coccham

47:40.720 --> 47:43.280
any more than I’m meant to live
a small life there.

47:43.920 --> 47:45.200
We’re wanderers, Father.

47:45.280 --> 47:49.080
We follow where the gods lead us
and the gods are sending me to Daneland.

47:49.800 --> 47:53.480
[sighs] Let me go...
for the sake of all Saxons.

47:54.400 --> 47:58.000
-I have sacrificed enough for them.
-Well, I have sacrificed nothing.

47:59.400 --> 48:03.000
Please! [sighs] I want to live
amongst my mother's people,

48:03.080 --> 48:08.080
to... [inhales] ...find the part of myself
that died when she was taken from me.

48:15.480 --> 48:16.440
Besides...

48:17.200 --> 48:18.160
[exhales]

48:19.120 --> 48:20.600
Sigtryggr is gentle.

48:23.680 --> 48:25.160
He's a man of honor!

48:37.800 --> 48:39.000
[sighs]

48:39.680 --> 48:41.440
You are mine to take care of.

48:42.480 --> 48:44.840
For too long, you’ve had nothing from me.

48:45.200 --> 48:47.400
I’ve had everything from you.

48:48.960 --> 48:52.120
Your blood is within me
and it’s made me a restless spirit.

48:52.560 --> 48:55.200
Please give me this chance
to live as you do,

48:55.280 --> 48:58.440
to follow a path without having certainty
of where it’s going to end.

49:02.120 --> 49:03.080
Let me go.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.280
[gasps and pants]

49:08.360 --> 49:10.120
How did you like your first battle?

49:10.200 --> 49:11.480
[chuckles painfully]

49:11.560 --> 49:13.320
I swear it will be my last.

49:13.400 --> 49:14.240
[both chuckle]

49:14.320 --> 49:16.960
From now on,
I will be staying in the tent.

49:17.040 --> 49:18.400
[Finan chuckles]

49:18.480 --> 49:20.600
You showed the spirit of a true warrior.

49:20.680 --> 49:21.600
[Eadith chuckles]

49:21.680 --> 49:24.400
[breathes heavily]
Perhaps my family honor is restored.

49:25.720 --> 49:28.560
If only those who cared for me
were still here to see it.

49:30.280 --> 49:31.480
[gasps softly in pain]

49:34.040 --> 49:35.840
[pants softly]

49:39.400 --> 49:42.760
Rest. It is over.

49:52.000 --> 49:53.760
-[thump of Aelswith falling]
-Mother!

49:54.480 --> 49:55.320
Mother!

49:55.400 --> 49:56.720
[pants]

49:58.400 --> 49:59.520
Mother!

50:06.440 --> 50:08.360
[breathes heavily]

50:08.440 --> 50:09.760
My mother is taken ill.

50:09.840 --> 50:12.200
I fear the Danes have claimed
another life.

50:13.000 --> 50:14.080
She's strong.

50:19.000 --> 50:20.600
My mother cannot care for him.

50:22.040 --> 50:22.960
How could I?

50:23.040 --> 50:25.680
Please, Uhtred.
I know you will not swear to me,

50:25.760 --> 50:28.120
but this child deserves more
than a monastery.

50:28.200 --> 50:33.360
He is a brave and a goodhearted boy,
but he will need guidance.

50:33.680 --> 50:37.120
Protect him and take him to safety.

50:37.600 --> 50:39.600
One aetheling is enough for Winchester.

50:40.480 --> 50:41.720
Bring him within the palace,

50:41.800 --> 50:46.640
it would create a strife
to rival that of Aethelwold.

50:46.720 --> 50:47.720
That is politics.

50:52.560 --> 50:54.480
What would you have me do with him?

50:54.560 --> 50:58.120
Teach him how to be a warrior
and all you know of the Danes.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.240
Teach him of Northumbria.

51:01.320 --> 51:04.160
You have just sworn
you will not fight for Northumbria.

51:04.240 --> 51:07.680
There are ways to take lands
without fighting for them.

51:07.760 --> 51:09.360
Sigtryggr has shown us this.

51:10.320 --> 51:12.400
Northumbria is the last kingdom.

51:12.480 --> 51:15.120
Without it under one King
and under Christ,

51:15.200 --> 51:16.960
there will be no England.

51:24.560 --> 51:25.600
[sighs]

51:32.080 --> 51:34.080
[crowd murmur in background]

51:49.560 --> 51:52.600
[Uhtred] It is hard for a father
to see his daughter go.

51:52.680 --> 51:56.120
[young Uhtred] But you were right, Father.
Sigtryggr is different.

51:56.600 --> 51:58.560
[Uhtred] Perhaps I was not so foolish.

51:59.720 --> 52:01.160
Or someone was guiding you.

52:02.840 --> 52:04.640
The gods like to see me fight.

52:06.080 --> 52:07.400
It is sport to them.

52:20.400 --> 52:22.400
I will return to my church, Father.

52:26.400 --> 52:28.600
I curse myself for my headstrong children.

52:29.200 --> 52:32.720
What can I say? My blood is the blood
of a stubborn bastard.

52:34.480 --> 52:35.400
[chuckles softly]

52:47.000 --> 52:52.600
[Uhtred] <i>So, in the reign of King Edward,</i>
<i>peace broke out between Saxon and Dane.</i>

52:55.360 --> 53:01.160
<i>And though it was not for the first time,</i>
<i>there was a sense the truce would last.</i>

53:02.920 --> 53:04.280
<i>But at what cost?</i>

53:08.800 --> 53:11.440
<i>Ambition stalks the Saxon palaces.</i>

53:13.440 --> 53:16.440
<i>In time, the King must choose his heir</i>

53:16.520 --> 53:18.880
<i>and the bonds of blood may be tested.</i>

53:23.280 --> 53:25.080
<i>Brothers may be torn apart...</i>

53:26.120 --> 53:28.480
<i>but a throne cannot stay empty.</i>

53:30.000 --> 53:33.160
<i>I now stand alone</i>
<i>with nothing but my sword.</i>

53:34.800 --> 53:37.200
<i>I failed in securing my birthright.</i>

53:38.440 --> 53:40.640
<i>I have given up the woman I love.</i>

53:41.400 --> 53:43.200
<i>My family are dispersed...</i>

53:43.920 --> 53:45.680
<i>perhaps never to be reunited...</i>

53:46.240 --> 53:49.160
<i>scattered far across the Saxon kingdoms.</i>

53:49.240 --> 53:53.680
[grunts in pain]

53:53.760 --> 53:55.240
[groans]

53:55.320 --> 53:59.800
<i>As a new feud is born,</i>
<i>revenge is certain to grow stronger.</i>

54:01.200 --> 54:03.240
[groans in pain]

54:05.680 --> 54:08.320
<i>I have sworn to protect a bastard child...</i>

54:09.600 --> 54:14.160
<i>whose path, I fear, is entwined</i>
<i>with that of this great land.</i>

54:15.600 --> 54:19.640
<i>And though I have refused</i>
<i>the service of Saxon Kings,</i>

54:19.720 --> 54:22.080
<i>it may only be a matter of time</i>

54:22.160 --> 54:25.320
<i>before fate draws me back</i>
<i>into their plans.</i>

54:26.040 --> 54:28.240
<i>Destiny is all!</i>
