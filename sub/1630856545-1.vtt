02:19.318 --> 02:20.449
- Hold on, hold on.

02:20.536 --> 02:21.450
No.

02:22.973 --> 02:25.889
We gotta put the big
black one in first.

02:35.377 --> 02:36.248
No, Meg, hold on.

02:36.334 --> 02:37.596
Just wait, okay?

02:39.338 --> 02:40.208
Okay?

02:41.166 --> 02:42.209
All right, I got it.

[luggage thudding]

02:51.611 --> 02:55.223
[muffled radio chattering]

03:03.188 --> 03:04.406
I grabbed your journal.

03:06.278 --> 03:07.627
It was under the couch.

03:13.720 --> 03:14.764
- You hungry?

03:14.851 --> 03:15.939
- Not really.

03:18.507 --> 03:21.206
[turning signal clicking]

03:21.293 --> 03:22.424
I'm not hungry.

03:24.557 --> 03:26.211
- Okay, but I gotta get gas.

03:28.038 --> 03:28.952
- Fine.

03:30.954 --> 03:31.868
Sorry.

04:01.463 --> 04:03.335
- [Newscaster] City Hall
today, a protest

04:03.422 --> 04:06.903
led by public safety
advocates aims to put pressure

04:06.990 --> 04:08.949
on the Boston police department.

04:09.297 --> 04:10.864
- [Protester] How many
other women and girls

04:10.951 --> 04:13.823
has the Boston police
stopped looking for?

04:13.910 --> 04:17.784
[muffled protesters shouting]

04:19.611 --> 04:21.570
[chip bag crackling]

04:21.657 --> 04:22.528
- [Newscaster] The
department came

04:22.615 --> 04:23.833
under pressure this spring-

04:23.920 --> 04:25.487
- Excuse me.
- After the shocking return

04:25.574 --> 04:26.836
of Megan Rhoads.

04:26.923 --> 04:27.924
The 32-year-old Beacon
Hill resident

04:28.011 --> 04:29.143
[tense music]
[low rumbling]

04:29.230 --> 04:30.927
had been assumed dead
by the police

04:31.014 --> 04:33.452
after she disappeared
from nearby parking garage

04:33.539 --> 04:36.324
nearly six months earlier.

04:41.460 --> 04:44.027
[tense music]

04:48.858 --> 04:50.295
- My great-grandfather
bought this place

04:50.382 --> 04:51.948
in the 20s, I think?

04:55.474 --> 04:58.259
We used to own everything
to the end of that road.

04:58.346 --> 05:00.827
[Meg chuckles softly]

05:26.896 --> 05:29.638

06:27.522 --> 06:30.395
[Meg gasps]

06:30.525 --> 06:31.831
- Sorry.

06:37.313 --> 06:39.142
- I'll grab the rest
of the bags.

06:39.229 --> 06:40.100
- Okay.

06:49.762 --> 06:52.895
[water whooshing]

06:53.156 --> 06:54.636
Where were your parents?

06:55.507 --> 06:58.031
- The adults all stayed
at the big house, mostly.

06:58.945 --> 06:59.685
Let me get this.

06:59.772 --> 07:01.034
- I got it.

07:01.121 --> 07:02.557
Where's that?

07:02.644 --> 07:04.820
- Well, the big house used
to be down by the beach,

07:04.907 --> 07:07.432
but they tore it down
when I was a kid.

07:07.519 --> 07:08.433
- Why?

07:09.434 --> 07:11.523
- 'Cause no one could
afford the property taxes.

07:11.610 --> 07:12.480
It was massive.

07:15.309 --> 07:16.919
- [Meg] So you were here alone?

07:17.746 --> 07:19.356
- Well, with the rest
of the cousins.

07:19.444 --> 07:21.097
This was like the cousins house.

07:22.229 --> 07:23.839
My grandmother hated
kids, I think,

07:23.926 --> 07:26.102
so she put us all in this house

07:26.189 --> 07:28.888
so she didn't have
to deal with us.

07:28.975 --> 07:29.976
- She sounds sweet.

07:31.586 --> 07:32.805
- No, she wasn't sweet.

07:33.762 --> 07:34.981
We wouldn't see her all summer

07:35.068 --> 07:37.200
and then one day she
would summon us down

07:37.287 --> 07:40.289
and individually interview
us about our interests

07:40.377 --> 07:42.379
and tell us us stand
up straight.

07:44.381 --> 07:45.513
Can I finish this?
- Oh.

07:45.600 --> 07:47.123
[glass clatters loudly]
Shit, sorry.

07:47.210 --> 07:48.124
- I'm sorry.

07:49.082 --> 07:50.562
Meg, you don't have shoes on.

07:50.649 --> 07:52.607
Just back away, it's okay.

[wine sloshing]

08:10.277 --> 08:13.323
[broken glass clattering]

08:13.410 --> 08:14.934
- Is anyone else coming down?

08:16.283 --> 08:17.197
- Doubt it.

08:18.981 --> 08:20.635
It's pretty empty in the winter.

08:26.075 --> 08:27.337
You sure you didn't...

08:27.424 --> 08:29.252
You alright?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

08:29.339 --> 08:30.689
Thank you.

08:30.776 --> 08:32.559
[Scott chuckles softly]

08:32.821 --> 08:33.953
- My reward.

08:34.039 --> 08:38.958
[Meg chuckles softly]
[tense music]

08:58.064 --> 09:00.719
[Scott sighs]

09:00.806 --> 09:01.676
Good?

09:04.070 --> 09:04.984
You sure?

09:09.989 --> 09:10.859
Come here.

09:16.735 --> 09:19.955
[Scott snores loudly]

09:26.048 --> 09:29.269
[Scott groans softly]

09:30.879 --> 09:33.578
[Scott snores loudly]

09:33.665 --> 09:36.058

10:46.128 --> 10:48.653

10:51.960 --> 10:52.831
- Scott?

11:28.562 --> 11:31.870
[Meg breathes shakily]

11:53.413 --> 11:54.327
Scott.

11:56.851 --> 11:57.722
Scott!

11:59.071 --> 12:00.376
[Scott grunts]

12:00.463 --> 12:01.377
Meg.

12:04.076 --> 12:04.946
It's okay.

12:06.513 --> 12:07.601
You're okay.

12:08.950 --> 12:09.995
You're okay.

12:11.823 --> 12:12.867
You're safe.

12:18.786 --> 12:20.440
- You were sleepwalking.

12:20.527 --> 12:21.354
- Hm?

12:21.441 --> 12:22.355
- Last night.

12:28.404 --> 12:29.754
Is there a dog here?

12:30.798 --> 12:31.712
- A dog?

12:34.497 --> 12:39.241
- I heard a dog bark and then
I dropped that weird plate.

12:41.896 --> 12:43.071
- What plate?

12:43.158 --> 12:45.726
[tense music]

12:52.994 --> 12:55.867
- You remember you dropped
a glass last night?

12:56.258 --> 12:59.348
- No, it was right here.

13:02.525 --> 13:03.918
[Scott sighs]

13:04.005 --> 13:06.268
- You remember what
Dr. Potter said?

13:07.748 --> 13:10.403
Sometimes nightmares can
feel really real.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.888
[glass clatters sharply]

13:16.975 --> 13:17.714
You okay?

13:18.977 --> 13:19.716
[Meg exhales shakily]

13:19.804 --> 13:20.543
- Yeah.

13:20.630 --> 13:21.936
[Scott kisses]

13:22.023 --> 13:22.894
- Okay.

13:29.814 --> 13:32.555

15:08.782 --> 15:10.610
[Meg sighs]

15:11.654 --> 15:13.004
[bird chirping]

15:13.526 --> 15:15.789
- I've been thinking
about Christmas.

15:16.659 --> 15:17.573
- Mm-hmm.

15:19.619 --> 15:21.577
- It might be nice to
spend it at home.

15:24.102 --> 15:25.973
- I thought you wanted
to come out here.

15:27.148 --> 15:28.236
- I did, but...

15:28.323 --> 15:30.021
[dog barking]

15:30.108 --> 15:31.283
- [Woman] Yoo-hoo!

15:31.370 --> 15:32.458
- Madelin?

15:32.545 --> 15:35.113
[tense music]

15:38.203 --> 15:40.683
[dog barking]

15:40.770 --> 15:42.250
- Hey, Minnow.

15:42.337 --> 15:43.338
Minnow!

15:43.425 --> 15:44.949
[Minnow barking]
Down!

15:45.036 --> 15:46.385
Down, Minnow!
- Minnow, off.

15:50.215 --> 15:51.738
Talkie. [laughs]
- Madelin.

15:51.825 --> 15:53.131
What are you doing here?

15:53.218 --> 15:56.047
I was just out for a
walk and I saw your car.

15:56.134 --> 15:57.526
I'm staying at my mother's
little shack.

15:57.613 --> 15:58.701
- [Scott] How's your mom doing?

15:58.788 --> 16:00.355
- [Madelin] Not well,
I'm afraid.

16:00.442 --> 16:01.226
- I'm so sorry, that's tough.

16:01.313 --> 16:02.227
- Yeah.

16:03.793 --> 16:08.233
And Meg, I'm so glad
to see you again!

16:08.320 --> 16:09.974
- I'm sorry?

16:10.061 --> 16:13.455
- Meg, this is my
cousin Madelin.

16:13.542 --> 16:14.979
You met her at the wedding.

16:15.066 --> 16:16.415
- Oh.

16:16.502 --> 16:17.633
- We've got a big family.

16:17.720 --> 16:20.767
I won't hold it against
you. [chuckles]

16:21.637 --> 16:24.814
So, how long are you here for?

16:24.901 --> 16:26.599
Not sure.
- Through the New Year.

16:27.556 --> 16:29.776
- I can't believe Talkie
didn't tell me

16:29.863 --> 16:31.343
you two were coming. [laughs]

16:31.430 --> 16:34.389
I didn't know anybody
was gonna be here.

16:34.476 --> 16:35.912
- Talkie?

16:36.000 --> 16:40.395
- Oh, well, Scott was
so quiet as a kid.

16:40.482 --> 16:42.267
I don't think he said
a word until you

16:42.354 --> 16:43.659
were what, two years old?

16:43.746 --> 16:45.009
- Okay, I don't think we
need to talk about this.

16:45.096 --> 16:47.054
- So we started calling
him, you know,

16:47.141 --> 16:48.751
I think it was grandmother
who first...

16:48.838 --> 16:51.450
In any case, we started calling
him walkie-talkie as a joke,

16:51.537 --> 16:55.541
and then just walkie Scotty,
and then just talkie.

16:56.411 --> 16:57.891
- Poor Scott.

16:57.978 --> 16:58.892
- Sorry?

16:59.936 --> 17:03.201
He just told me how tough
your grandmother could be.

17:03.288 --> 17:04.201
- Oh, I was just telling
her about

17:04.289 --> 17:06.291
the famous sit-down interviews.

17:06.507 --> 17:07.466
- Right.

17:10.729 --> 17:13.907
You know, I had a friend
in college named Meg.

17:13.994 --> 17:16.257
It was short for Megumi.

17:16.344 --> 17:17.650
- Oh.

17:17.737 --> 17:19.434
- Is your name short
for anything?

17:21.610 --> 17:22.524
- Megan.

17:24.135 --> 17:25.919
- So you need some
cream and sugar?

17:26.920 --> 17:29.488
- Did you forget how
I take my tea?

17:29.575 --> 17:30.837
- Do you wanna do it yourself-
- Has it been that long?

17:30.924 --> 17:32.186
- -you can just take care of it.

17:32.273 --> 17:34.406
- [Madelin] Has it been
that long? [laughs]

17:34.493 --> 17:37.104
[tense music]

18:19.755 --> 18:21.453
[Meg exhales shakily]

18:21.540 --> 18:23.324
- Let me see how you're
holding it.

18:23.411 --> 18:24.412
You gotta hold it
like that that.

18:24.499 --> 18:25.544
All right, right here, ready?

18:25.631 --> 18:27.415
- Okay.

18:27.502 --> 18:30.810
[tennis ball thumping]

18:39.427 --> 18:40.167
[Scott grunts]

18:40.254 --> 18:40.994
- Yes!

18:41.081 --> 18:42.256
Nice shot, Madelin.

18:42.343 --> 18:44.476
[Madelin laughing]

18:44.563 --> 18:45.912
- I've got it.

18:45.999 --> 18:49.655
[Meg grunts loudly]

18:49.742 --> 18:50.873
- [Scott] I'll get it.

18:53.093 --> 18:54.529
- It's okay.

18:54.616 --> 18:56.792
- Oh, it is really
back here, Meg.

18:56.879 --> 18:57.967
- Sorry.

18:59.404 --> 19:00.535
- It's lodged deep.

19:00.622 --> 19:02.581
[tense music]
You know, it helps

19:02.668 --> 19:07.629
if you square your hips
and start low.

19:08.543 --> 19:10.502
Keep your eye on the ball.

19:10.589 --> 19:13.331
Swing through all the way over.

19:15.985 --> 19:16.725
- Yeah?

19:16.812 --> 19:18.292
- [Scott] Got it.

19:19.598 --> 19:20.773
- Why don't we just rally?

19:20.860 --> 19:23.906
Give Meg a chance to
get her bearings.

19:32.088 --> 19:34.874

20:21.442 --> 20:22.704
[Meg whimpering]

20:22.791 --> 20:23.879
- Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg,
Meg, Meg, Meg, Meg.

20:23.966 --> 20:27.056
[Meg crying loudly]

20:28.144 --> 20:28.884
[high-pitched whining]

20:28.971 --> 20:30.625
It's not, it's not.

20:45.118 --> 20:48.034
[calm vocalizing]

21:08.881 --> 21:10.926
- I used to count the footsteps.

21:11.013 --> 21:13.755
[clock ticking]

21:15.540 --> 21:17.106
The house was old.

21:22.634 --> 21:23.983
The sound carried.

21:37.605 --> 21:38.998
I started counting

21:42.741 --> 21:44.308
how long it would
take them to get

21:44.395 --> 21:46.266
to different places
in the house.

21:56.624 --> 22:01.673
It helped a little

22:02.978 --> 22:05.807
to always know how long it
would take them to get to me.

22:10.986 --> 22:14.076
[Scott sighs]

22:14.163 --> 22:16.601
[Meg sighs]

22:17.558 --> 22:19.952
- Dr. Potter said it
could be really helpful

22:21.040 --> 22:22.346
to write in your journal

22:26.741 --> 22:28.656
when you're having
moments like this.

22:43.671 --> 22:44.933
Can I go get it for you?

22:49.764 --> 22:52.550
[glass clinking]

22:53.855 --> 22:57.076
So this is an Argentinian wine.

22:57.163 --> 23:00.645
It's supposed to be really
good, sort of peppery.

23:05.737 --> 23:06.651
Good?

23:07.913 --> 23:09.436
- Good.

23:09.523 --> 23:12.047
I dunno.

23:12.134 --> 23:13.875
- No, [laughs] wait,
what are you doing?

23:13.962 --> 23:15.834
- You hate it.
- No, I love it.

23:15.921 --> 23:17.444
- And you're sure?
- Yes.

23:17.531 --> 23:18.706
- And you wanna drink it?
- Mm-hmm, I wanna drink it.

23:18.793 --> 23:20.273
- We have others.
- No, I want this one.

23:20.360 --> 23:21.187
[Meg laughs softly]

23:21.274 --> 23:22.536
Put the wine down, psycho.

23:22.623 --> 23:25.974
[Minnow barking]
- Yoo-hoo!

23:26.061 --> 23:27.846
Minnow, down.

23:27.933 --> 23:30.718
Off.
[Minnow panting]

23:30.805 --> 23:32.024
Oh.

23:32.111 --> 23:32.894
Hello.

23:32.981 --> 23:33.852
- Hello, hello, hello.

23:33.939 --> 23:35.114
[Madelin kisses animatedly]

23:35.201 --> 23:37.682
I brought chicken
and an eggplant.

23:37.769 --> 23:39.640
- Oh, you didn't have to.

23:39.727 --> 23:40.989
- Oh, my mother barely
eats anyway

23:41.076 --> 23:42.382
and I don't want all
this to go to waste.

23:42.469 --> 23:44.253
Here, would you get
to work on this?

23:44.340 --> 23:49.171
- Oh, actually, I'm sorry,
we weren't expecting you.

23:50.521 --> 23:52.479
- Oh, god, so American.

23:52.566 --> 23:54.438
What is it, five o'clock?
[laughs]

23:54.525 --> 23:56.048
- [Scott] 6:30.

23:56.135 --> 23:58.267
- If you got to a restaurant
in Paris at eight o'clock,

23:58.354 --> 23:59.921
you'd be the first ones there.

24:00.922 --> 24:01.662
- You know what?

24:01.749 --> 24:02.489
We can have it tomorrow.

24:02.576 --> 24:03.447
- Yeah.

24:03.534 --> 24:04.448
Thank you.

24:08.539 --> 24:11.193
[Scott sighs]

24:11.280 --> 24:12.934
- Well, I better be off.

24:16.982 --> 24:18.853
- Would you like to
stay for dinner?

24:18.940 --> 24:19.680
- That's a good idea.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.203
- No, I couldn't impose.

24:21.290 --> 24:22.509
- No, it's not an imposition.

24:22.596 --> 24:23.728
I can just set out an extra...

24:23.815 --> 24:24.903
- Alright, well, wonderful.

24:24.990 --> 24:25.817
Talkie, get out the
good glasses.

24:25.904 --> 24:28.472
I have a surprise for you.

24:30.386 --> 24:31.823
- Is that the family rye?

24:31.910 --> 24:33.868
- The last batch. [laughs]

24:33.955 --> 24:35.479
- You make your own whiskey?

24:35.566 --> 24:36.958
- Yeah, well, our
great-grandfather-

24:37.045 --> 24:38.307
- Great-great-grandfather.

24:38.394 --> 24:40.092
- Our great-great-grandfather
was a banker

24:40.179 --> 24:44.313
and a man owed him money, and
after the markets crashed,

24:44.400 --> 24:45.489
he couldn't pay in cash so-

24:45.576 --> 24:50.232
- So Pop let him pay
us in whiskey.

24:50.319 --> 24:53.845
- We've had a basement full
of stuff for almost a century,

24:53.932 --> 24:55.237
but we're almost out now.

24:56.325 --> 24:58.893
- To the fall of
our great house.

25:00.068 --> 25:03.028
[glasses clinking]

25:08.729 --> 25:10.252
[Meg coughs]

25:10.339 --> 25:13.168
- Let me just grab the wine
and then we will be ready.

25:13.255 --> 25:15.083
[Madelin chuckles]

25:15.170 --> 25:16.998
- Looks delicious, Talkie.

25:17.085 --> 25:17.999
- Yeah.

25:22.177 --> 25:25.398
[silverware scraping]

25:30.751 --> 25:32.927
- How are things at the firm?

25:33.014 --> 25:36.409
- Oh, yeah, I'm still on
leave through the holidays,

25:36.496 --> 25:40.413
but yeah, I spoke to the
partners and they
were suggesting

25:40.500 --> 25:42.284
a January 10th return.

25:42.371 --> 25:43.068
- [Madelin] Oh, that's
wonderful.

25:43.155 --> 25:44.069
- What?

25:44.939 --> 25:45.897
- I told you that.

25:47.376 --> 25:52.425
- And Meg, Scotty tells
me you were an engineer.

25:53.905 --> 25:54.906
- Am.

25:54.993 --> 25:55.994
- Hm?

25:56.081 --> 25:57.735
- I am an engineer.

25:57.822 --> 25:59.650
I'm also returning to
work in the new year.

25:59.737 --> 26:02.261
- Oh, that's fantastic news.

26:02.348 --> 26:03.915
Scotty didn't mention it.

26:04.002 --> 26:05.786
- Yeah, thank you.

26:05.873 --> 26:06.744
- When?

26:08.833 --> 26:10.530
When are you going back?

26:12.227 --> 26:14.403
- I'm not exactly sure yet.

26:14.490 --> 26:16.884
They're still reconfiguring
my position.

26:16.971 --> 26:18.364
- Of course.

26:18.451 --> 26:19.670
I'm sure they had to
shuffle things around a bit

26:19.757 --> 26:20.671
when you got back.

26:25.937 --> 26:27.460
- What do you do?

26:27.547 --> 26:29.767
- Oh, a little of this,
a little of that.

26:29.854 --> 26:33.031
I take care of my mother,
and then there's the land.

26:33.118 --> 26:35.076
That just never stops.

26:35.163 --> 26:37.905
- Madelin actually taught
in Korea after college.

26:37.992 --> 26:39.559
Meg was born in Seoul.

26:40.342 --> 26:41.300
- Oh!

26:41.387 --> 26:45.130
[speaking Korean]

26:47.828 --> 26:50.701
- Sorry, I don't speak Korean.

26:50.788 --> 26:53.355
- Oh, [laughs] don't
worry about it.

26:53.442 --> 26:54.966
I just asked when you left.

26:56.184 --> 27:00.711
- Oh, I was adopted
when I was three.

27:02.669 --> 27:04.976
- Oh.
- Can you pass the salt?

27:05.063 --> 27:05.977
- Yeah.

27:08.849 --> 27:10.851
- So I ran into the
Harrisons at the market.

27:10.938 --> 27:12.113
- I heard they were selling.

27:12.200 --> 27:12.984
- [Scott] Indeed, they are.

27:13.071 --> 27:15.290
[Madelin gasps]

27:15.377 --> 27:16.161
Their neighbors
[Minnow whimpering]

27:16.248 --> 27:16.988
bought the property.

27:17.075 --> 27:18.511
- Uh-huh.

27:18.598 --> 27:19.643
- They're putting in a
pool over the entire lot.

27:19.730 --> 27:20.861
- [Madelin] Oh.

27:20.948 --> 27:21.993
- [Scott] Tearing down
the old house.

27:22.080 --> 27:22.994
- Stop it.

27:26.214 --> 27:29.740
You teach a dog to beg,
it'll never stop.

27:35.310 --> 27:36.311
- Pass the salad.

27:39.663 --> 27:44.668
[water whooshing]
[plates clinking]

27:54.852 --> 27:57.245
- How are you guys
related again?

27:57.332 --> 27:58.464
- [Scott] We're cousins.

28:00.553 --> 28:01.685
- Like first cousins?

28:03.208 --> 28:04.818
- Our dads are brothers, why?

28:07.038 --> 28:07.908
- Nothing.

28:14.088 --> 28:14.959
It's just

28:18.702 --> 28:21.182
what was with Madelin
speaking in Korean to me?

28:23.707 --> 28:25.796
- I think she was just
trying to connect.

28:27.754 --> 28:31.149
- Okay, but I also have
family in Sweden.

28:32.324 --> 28:35.022
I bet she wouldn't have tried
to speak in Swedish to me.

28:36.197 --> 28:39.244
- Well, I don't think she
speaks Swedish, but okay.

28:40.419 --> 28:42.769
[Meg sighs]

28:42.856 --> 28:44.379
[Scott sighs]

28:44.466 --> 28:46.512
Do you want me to talk
to her about it?

28:46.599 --> 28:48.557
- No, thank you.

28:53.214 --> 28:55.608
[Meg sighs]

28:56.783 --> 28:57.697
- I know.

29:02.354 --> 29:04.486
It's always made me kind
of uncomfortable,

29:06.662 --> 29:10.579
but I [laughs] can't control
what they put on their walls.

29:10.666 --> 29:11.755
- [Meg] Yeah.

29:11.842 --> 29:13.452
- [Scott] And it was
a long time ago.

29:16.890 --> 29:17.761
- But...

29:18.718 --> 29:19.458
[Scott sighs]

29:19.545 --> 29:20.720
- What?

29:20.807 --> 29:23.462
- Well, what did your
grandparents do

29:23.549 --> 29:24.855
when they were over there?

29:24.942 --> 29:27.379
- My great grandparents
were missionaries.

29:27.466 --> 29:30.425
- So they built churches and
taught people English, right?

29:31.209 --> 29:32.863
- Right.

29:32.950 --> 29:37.650
- Okay, and what did Madelin
do when she was over there?

29:37.737 --> 29:39.826
- Okay, she taught
at a university.

29:39.913 --> 29:41.175
- She taught English! [laughs]

29:41.262 --> 29:42.350
- It's not the same thing.

29:42.437 --> 29:43.743
- Really?

29:43.830 --> 29:45.310
'Cause it feels like a
different iteration

29:45.397 --> 29:46.659
of the same thing to me.

29:47.921 --> 29:50.489
[Scott sighs]

29:56.582 --> 29:59.367
- Well, I guess we
just disagree.

30:02.283 --> 30:03.850
We can disagree, right?

30:08.246 --> 30:09.160
- Yeah.

30:12.990 --> 30:13.860
- Okay.

30:15.906 --> 30:18.430
[Meg gasps]

30:18.517 --> 30:21.825
[Meg breathes shakily]

30:27.526 --> 30:30.094
[tense music]

30:36.491 --> 30:37.405
- Scott?

30:43.281 --> 30:44.804
[high-pitched whining]

30:44.891 --> 30:47.633
[slow thudding]

31:17.010 --> 31:19.534
[Man whistles]

31:19.621 --> 31:22.624
[muffled shouting]

31:25.889 --> 31:26.802
- Hi.

31:34.506 --> 31:36.247
- You gotta stay below
the water line

31:36.334 --> 31:38.031
if you're gonna walk
around here.

31:40.686 --> 31:41.600
- Why?

31:42.514 --> 31:43.819
- It's private property.

31:45.125 --> 31:46.735
- Are you a Whitman?

31:46.822 --> 31:47.911
[Man laughs]

31:47.998 --> 31:49.173
- No, I just do some
repairs for them

31:49.260 --> 31:50.870
in exchange for fishing rights.

31:52.002 --> 31:54.047
They're really uptight
about trespassing.

31:58.051 --> 32:02.186
- I'm actually here with
my husband, Scott Whitman.

32:04.492 --> 32:05.841
- Shit, sorry, I'm an idiot.

32:05.929 --> 32:06.842
- [Meg] [laughs] No, it's fine.

32:06.930 --> 32:08.409
- I didn't realize he was back.

32:08.496 --> 32:10.629
Yeah, the summer crowd
doesn't usually come so often

32:10.716 --> 32:11.891
during the off season.

32:16.287 --> 32:17.766
- What do you mean so often?

32:19.551 --> 32:22.902
- Nothing, just he was here
last winter for a while.

32:25.949 --> 32:32.042
Hey, I'm really sorry
about what happened to you.

32:36.089 --> 32:37.134
- Thank you.

32:46.665 --> 32:49.233
[tense music]

32:53.324 --> 32:56.370
[door thuds softly]

33:05.075 --> 33:08.295
Why have we never come out here?

33:08.382 --> 33:10.254
- There's just so much baggage,

33:11.081 --> 33:13.431
so much family stuff out here.

33:13.518 --> 33:15.737
I guess I'm realizing that

33:17.522 --> 33:19.741
it's been so long since
I've been out here.

33:22.179 --> 33:24.224
I'm glad we're here now.

33:30.317 --> 33:33.016
[coat rustling]

33:34.669 --> 33:37.977
[garage door rumbling]

33:39.892 --> 33:42.329
[wrench clicking]

33:42.416 --> 33:44.723
[screwdriver clicking]

33:44.810 --> 33:47.639
[parts rustling]

33:55.516 --> 33:58.128
[pencil scratching]

33:58.215 --> 34:00.782
[tense music]

34:01.870 --> 34:05.352
[both breathing heavily]

34:13.317 --> 34:15.275
[door thuds]

34:15.362 --> 34:16.755
- Stay with me.

34:19.932 --> 34:21.019
[door thuds loudly]

34:21.106 --> 34:23.675
[tense music]

34:25.981 --> 34:26.939
[door banging loudly]

34:27.026 --> 34:30.334
[high-pitched whining]

34:50.396 --> 34:52.747
[high-pitched whining]

34:52.834 --> 34:53.617
See?

34:53.704 --> 34:55.228
Everything's fine.

35:04.498 --> 35:08.111
[glass clattering sharply]

35:25.519 --> 35:28.087
[tense music]

36:01.468 --> 36:04.950
[Madelin singing eerily]

36:23.621 --> 36:25.275
- Shit.
- Meg!

36:26.189 --> 36:29.670
[Madelin laughing]

36:29.757 --> 36:32.151
Go in, go in, I'll
be right there!

36:37.722 --> 36:39.506
[footsteps thumping]

36:39.593 --> 36:42.074
It's incredible for
the immune system,

36:42.161 --> 36:44.468
the cold air and hot
water together.

36:44.555 --> 36:46.426
I haven't been sick in years.

36:46.513 --> 36:48.602
- Oh, thank you.

36:48.689 --> 36:49.603
- Mm-hmm.

36:53.390 --> 36:55.740
My mother became obsessed
with oil painting

36:55.827 --> 36:56.958
when she got sick.

36:58.133 --> 36:59.918
Can't tell you how many
hours we sat like that,

37:00.005 --> 37:01.049
posing for her.

37:02.703 --> 37:03.922
- You used to be blonde?

37:05.489 --> 37:06.359
- Briefly.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.233
- It doesn't look like you.

37:11.886 --> 37:13.540
- She wasn't a great painter.

37:14.411 --> 37:17.457
[Meg laughs softly]

37:18.763 --> 37:19.981
- Who's the little boy?

37:21.722 --> 37:22.636
- My brother.

37:25.204 --> 37:26.074
- Your brother?

37:28.990 --> 37:32.255
- He died when he was
five and I was eight.

37:34.126 --> 37:36.041
We were swimming right
off our beach.

37:40.611 --> 37:41.481
- I'm sorry.

37:42.656 --> 37:44.267
- For most of my childhood,
I thought I dreamt

37:44.354 --> 37:45.398
the whole thing.

37:45.485 --> 37:47.052
My parents never talked
about him.

37:47.922 --> 37:49.837
I don't know what possessed
my mother to paint him

37:49.924 --> 37:50.969
into that portrait.

37:52.710 --> 37:54.712
I'm not even sure it's
a good likeness.

38:04.112 --> 38:06.027
- I think I saw her earlier.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.074
- Who?

38:10.597 --> 38:13.557
- Your mother, walking
in the woods.

38:15.428 --> 38:16.777
- My mother is bedridden.

38:18.301 --> 38:20.128
She hasn't left that
room in months.

38:21.521 --> 38:22.392
- Oh.

38:32.489 --> 38:34.012
How is she?

38:34.099 --> 38:35.013
- She's dying.

38:36.710 --> 38:37.581
- I'm sorry.

38:38.756 --> 38:41.062
- She hasn't enjoyed
life for many years.

38:42.455 --> 38:44.457
Death will be a mercy.

38:44.544 --> 38:47.112
[tense music]

38:49.549 --> 38:50.550
Coyotes.

38:52.117 --> 38:53.684
They can be a real menace.

38:59.342 --> 39:01.126
Mm, what's that?

39:03.824 --> 39:05.348
- Oh, it's nothing.

39:05.435 --> 39:06.827
Just a nervous habit.

39:06.914 --> 39:08.394
- What are you nervous about?

39:09.874 --> 39:11.136
- Nothing.

39:11.223 --> 39:12.790
- Is it all the talk of death?

39:14.269 --> 39:15.706
[Madelin chuckles]

39:15.793 --> 39:17.055
Are you afraid of dying?

39:18.970 --> 39:19.971
- Everyone is.

39:20.058 --> 39:21.059
- Not everyone.

39:22.582 --> 39:24.845
Some people believe we
go somewhere better.

39:26.760 --> 39:31.112
Other people think anywhere
is better than here.

39:39.556 --> 39:40.905
- May I use your bathroom?

39:42.515 --> 39:44.212
- Right at the top
of the stairs.

39:53.874 --> 39:56.703
[low rumbling]

39:56.790 --> 39:57.661
- Wrong way.

39:58.879 --> 40:00.751
[Meg chuckles awkwardly]

40:00.838 --> 40:01.665
Upstairs.

40:04.145 --> 40:07.322

40:24.557 --> 40:25.906

40:25.993 --> 40:28.474
[Meg grunts]

40:35.916 --> 40:38.441
[tense music]

40:42.270 --> 40:45.883
- Yoo-hoo!
[Minnow barking]

40:50.975 --> 40:52.193
So I steal the keys.

40:52.280 --> 40:53.673
- Naturally, I stole
the booze. [laughs]

40:53.760 --> 40:56.502
- And we get out on the
water and it's pitch black

40:56.589 --> 40:58.461
on the water, and I
look at Madelin,

40:58.548 --> 41:01.072
I hand her the keys, and that's
when we realized [laughs]

41:01.159 --> 41:03.814
neither of us knows how
to drive a boat.

41:03.901 --> 41:07.034
So we just floated for a
little while and about an hour

41:07.121 --> 41:10.516
into it, we realize we have
drifted well off our mooring,

41:10.603 --> 41:13.084
like out into the bay,
and suddenly Madelin

41:13.171 --> 41:14.520
gets a look of confidence.

41:14.607 --> 41:15.869
- I mean, gin can do
that to a girl, you know?

41:15.956 --> 41:17.784
- And she declares, "I'm
gonna drive us back."

41:17.871 --> 41:19.307
- [Madelin] Yeah, and I did!

41:19.394 --> 41:20.961
- Well, you did,
but you drove us

41:21.048 --> 41:23.660
right into the neighbor's dock,
to be fair. [Madelin laughs]

41:23.747 --> 41:25.183
So if the boat is totaled.

41:25.270 --> 41:27.620
Their dock is like splinters.

41:27.707 --> 41:28.578
She looks at me.

41:28.665 --> 41:29.317
You remember what you said?

41:29.404 --> 41:30.623
I'll never forget.

41:30.710 --> 41:32.146
[Madelin clears throat]

41:32.233 --> 41:33.974
- "Do you think mother will
notice the gin is gone?"

41:34.061 --> 41:36.803
[both laughing]

41:41.155 --> 41:42.243
- I love that story.

41:42.330 --> 41:43.506
Oh, man.

41:43.593 --> 41:44.768
- So what did you do?

41:46.639 --> 41:47.901
- About what?

41:49.816 --> 41:51.035
- The boat.

41:51.122 --> 41:52.689
The dock.

41:52.776 --> 41:56.127
- [Madelin] Oh, we had it
repaired, I mean. [laughs]

41:56.214 --> 41:57.520
- Must have been expensive.

41:57.607 --> 41:58.521
- Mm-mm.

41:59.347 --> 42:01.524
We don't talk about money
at the dinner table.

42:08.661 --> 42:10.054
- But we're already talking
about money.

42:10.141 --> 42:12.186
- Meg, it's just a story.

42:13.579 --> 42:14.624
- What do you mean?

42:15.450 --> 42:17.540
- Well, that's what this
whole story is about.

42:18.802 --> 42:19.890
[Scott sighs]

42:19.977 --> 42:21.065
It's fine.

42:22.327 --> 42:23.676
I'm not saying it's bad.

42:24.547 --> 42:25.722
I just think it's funny.

42:26.636 --> 42:29.334
Only rich people think it's
rude to talk about money.

42:33.033 --> 42:36.254
- It's interesting you don't
consider yourself rich.

42:37.734 --> 42:38.952
- Well, it's different.

42:40.301 --> 42:42.260
I didn't grow up with money.

42:42.347 --> 42:44.915
- But you have money now.

42:45.002 --> 42:48.092
- My parents' life
insurance, not a trust fund.
- Because as I understand
it, you actually have

42:48.179 --> 42:50.573
a good deal more money
than either Scott or me.

42:53.619 --> 42:55.403
I'm not saying it's bad.

42:55.490 --> 42:58.711
[wine sloshing]

42:58.798 --> 42:59.669
Just funny.

43:02.933 --> 43:06.240
[Meg chuckles quietly]

43:14.771 --> 43:16.033
This has been lovely.

43:17.164 --> 43:19.602
I should really go check
on my mother.

43:19.689 --> 43:20.690
- Oh.

43:20.777 --> 43:22.082
- Oh, I'm sorry.

43:22.169 --> 43:23.127
- Yeah, I'll just...

43:23.214 --> 43:24.781
If you're not done, we can...

43:30.961 --> 43:33.006
[Meg laughs quietly]

43:33.093 --> 43:34.007
- I'm done.

43:34.094 --> 43:35.008
It's fine.

43:36.270 --> 43:37.402
- She'll eat it later.

43:40.318 --> 43:41.232
- It's fine.

43:45.715 --> 43:47.978
- She doesn't like to eat
in front of people anymore.

43:56.247 --> 43:57.640
- [Madelin] You poor thing.

44:06.039 --> 44:08.607

[Meg chewing loudly]

45:08.101 --> 45:11.322
So we're just not gonna
talk about it.

45:15.282 --> 45:17.850
[Scott sighs]

45:33.300 --> 45:34.649
- They poisoned your food.

45:36.042 --> 45:39.089
Not every time, but
enough to keep you scared.

45:42.527 --> 45:44.181
And I'm sorry, I don't...

45:45.791 --> 45:47.575
I'm sorry they did that to you.

45:54.539 --> 45:58.021
[Scott breathes shakily]

46:05.768 --> 46:07.770
- They made me make videos.

46:08.945 --> 46:10.511
[tense music]

46:10.598 --> 46:14.428
They made me beg you for help.

46:16.866 --> 46:17.780
- Not tonight.

46:21.174 --> 46:22.393
- Are you serious?

46:22.480 --> 46:23.437
- [Scott] I'm tired,
I'm not doing this.

46:23.524 --> 46:24.699
- We're having a conversation.

46:24.787 --> 46:25.700
- No, we're not!

into a Whitman woman here.

- I'm not a Whitman.

you in town for?

- Lonely.

50:16.583 --> 50:18.063
- [Joe] Madelin?

50:18.150 --> 50:19.978
- My husband's cousin?

50:20.065 --> 50:21.284
- Mm.

50:21.371 --> 50:22.763
Oh, yeah.

50:22.850 --> 50:24.852
I mean, I don't know her,
but I see her around.

50:25.766 --> 50:27.029
- And my husband Scott.

50:28.465 --> 50:31.381
You saw him around
too, last winter?

50:32.991 --> 50:34.906
- Yeah, a couple times.

off about her.

51:05.937 --> 51:07.330
- Madelin?

- She's intense.

back for it in the morning.

53:02.009 --> 53:03.010
- I can't leave it!

53:03.097 --> 53:04.098
It's not mine.

53:04.186 --> 53:05.274
- I'm right up there.

53:08.233 --> 53:09.321
- No, no, no.

53:09.408 --> 53:11.149
I wanna drive myself.

53:11.236 --> 53:12.629
- You can't drive,
you're wasted.

53:12.716 --> 53:13.804
- I wanna go home.

53:13.891 --> 53:15.545
- I'm taking you home.

53:15.632 --> 53:17.024
Careful, careful.

53:17.111 --> 53:18.069
- Give me my keys.

53:18.156 --> 53:18.896
- No way. [laughs]

53:18.983 --> 53:20.158
- Get off me!

53:20.245 --> 53:20.985
[Meg shouts]
[Joe grunts]

53:31.387 --> 53:32.779

[Joe groans]

54:14.647 --> 54:16.258
- [Scott] Where were you?

54:16.345 --> 54:19.086
[coin rattling]

54:21.263 --> 54:23.265
- Out.

54:23.352 --> 54:25.919
[Scott sighs]

54:29.575 --> 54:33.362
[footsteps thudding quietly]

54:34.841 --> 54:39.933
Where were you?

54:50.857 --> 54:53.991
Where were you when I was gone?

54:56.341 --> 54:57.647
- Are you drunk?

55:00.954 --> 55:02.347
- [Meg] Answer the question.

55:09.441 --> 55:11.269
- You need to go to bed.

55:15.665 --> 55:18.624
[clothes rustling]

55:21.192 --> 55:23.194
- I wanna talk about the videos.

55:23.281 --> 55:25.544
[Scott sighs]

55:25.631 --> 55:26.676
- Oh my god.

55:28.895 --> 55:32.116
I didn't get any fucking
videos, okay.

55:33.552 --> 55:36.425
- Then why weren't you parked
in the driveway that night?

55:38.731 --> 55:39.645
[Scott sighs]

55:39.732 --> 55:41.081
- You sure you wanna do this?

55:42.953 --> 55:45.042
You sure you wanna do
this again tonight?

55:48.959 --> 55:52.397
- You asked me to get
your phone from the car,

55:55.444 --> 55:57.402
but you weren't parked
in the driveway.

55:59.361 --> 56:02.755
You were parked in the garage.

56:04.801 --> 56:06.324
We never park there.

Why weren't you parked
in the driveway?

[Scott sighs]

56:15.725 --> 56:17.204
Answer the fucking question.

56:20.425 --> 56:22.166
- Am I under investigation here?

56:25.778 --> 56:26.692
Am I?

56:29.652 --> 56:34.700
Because you know, the
police, they asked me

56:35.266 --> 56:36.702
all these questions already.

56:38.095 --> 56:39.009
You remember?

56:44.275 --> 56:46.930
And they were satisfied
with the answers I gave 'em,

56:51.978 --> 56:53.545
so why aren't you satisfied?

56:56.418 --> 56:58.507
Huh?
[Meg cries quietly]

56:58.594 --> 56:59.899
Why aren't you satisfied?

57:00.813 --> 57:03.250

57:03.337 --> 57:04.251
Answer me.

question, please.

Open the door.

59:04.502 --> 59:08.811
- Meg.

59:41.060 --> 59:43.933
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

59:46.631 --> 59:47.545
Meggie.

59:53.203 --> 59:54.291
Meg, please.

59:56.598 --> 59:57.511
Meg.

59:59.078 --> 01:00:00.166
Please, Meg.

01:00:01.777 --> 01:00:02.908
I'm so sorry.

01:00:04.127 --> 01:00:05.128
Meg, I'm so sorry.

01:00:05.215 --> 01:00:06.216
Look at me.

01:00:07.086 --> 01:00:08.000
Meg, Meg.

01:00:10.612 --> 01:00:11.525
Meg, look at me.

01:00:14.920 --> 01:00:17.488
[Scott cries]

01:00:19.490 --> 01:00:22.319
I'm such a piece of shit.

01:00:22.406 --> 01:00:24.669
I'm such a fucking asshole.

01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:27.759
I can't lose you again.

01:00:33.939 --> 01:00:38.988
I'll do anything.
[Meg breathes shakily]

[crow cawing]

01:00:49.563 --> 01:00:51.130
- I wanna go home.

01:00:52.654 --> 01:00:53.567
- Okay.

01:00:54.612 --> 01:00:55.526
Okay.

01:00:56.396 --> 01:00:57.571
Okay, we'll go home.

01:00:58.355 --> 01:00:59.617
We'll go home tomorrow.

01:01:01.619 --> 01:01:02.533
- Today.

01:01:05.144 --> 01:01:07.669
- All right, we'll home today.

01:01:09.018 --> 01:01:12.195
Thank you, thank you.
[Meg cries quietly]

01:01:12.282 --> 01:01:13.196
Thank you.

01:01:15.024 --> 01:01:15.894
Thank you.

01:01:53.323 --> 01:01:54.237
Meg.

01:02:11.994 --> 01:02:14.866
So they can send someone
tomorrow.

01:02:17.347 --> 01:02:18.261
It's okay.

01:02:19.828 --> 01:02:21.307
We'll be back home tomorrow,
all right?

01:02:22.482 --> 01:02:23.527
Just one more day.

01:02:26.704 --> 01:02:28.184
You okay?

01:02:28.271 --> 01:02:30.926
[Scott kisses]

01:02:31.753 --> 01:02:34.538
[grass rustling]

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:36.105
- Why are we here?

01:02:37.106 --> 01:02:40.196
- Just one drink, I promise.

01:02:41.719 --> 01:02:42.851
We have to say goodbye.

01:02:42.938 --> 01:02:44.461
- Why here, though?

01:02:44.548 --> 01:02:47.420
- We used to throw parties
here when we were teenagers.

01:02:47.507 --> 01:02:48.204
[Madelin laughs]
- Hello.

01:02:48.291 --> 01:02:49.248
[tense music]

01:02:49.335 --> 01:02:50.554
- Let's see if we still got it.

01:02:53.731 --> 01:02:56.734
[ping pong ball clattering]

01:02:56.821 --> 01:02:57.996
- [Scott] We threw this
big party here

01:02:58.083 --> 01:02:59.041
at the end of the summer.

01:02:59.128 --> 01:03:00.607
[Madelin laughs]

01:03:00.694 --> 01:03:02.044
Do you remember the punch?

01:03:02.131 --> 01:03:03.610
- [Madelin] Yeah, we
mixed it in a garbage can!

01:03:03.697 --> 01:03:08.267
- Whoa, let me show you that.

01:03:10.269 --> 01:03:11.444

01:03:13.185 --> 01:03:14.056
- I'm comin', I'm comin'.

01:03:14.143 --> 01:03:15.057
Try it.

01:03:15.927 --> 01:03:17.755
I think I fell off my
bike every 10 yards

01:03:17.842 --> 01:03:19.409
on the way home.
- I wish I'd brought my bike.

01:03:19.496 --> 01:03:20.627
Maybe then I would've
made it home

01:03:20.714 --> 01:03:22.586
instead of passed
out on the beach.

01:03:22.673 --> 01:03:23.935
- [Scott] [chuckles]
I forgot about that.

01:03:24.022 --> 01:03:25.894
- I swear, my mother never did.

01:03:27.199 --> 01:03:28.461
- How is your mother?

01:03:31.595 --> 01:03:32.901
- She's hanging in there.

01:03:33.945 --> 01:03:37.035
- We should stop by
before we leave.

01:03:37.122 --> 01:03:38.210
I'd love to meet her.

01:03:39.516 --> 01:03:41.126
- My mother is very frail.

01:03:42.649 --> 01:03:45.304
- Don't you think she'd
enjoy some company?

01:03:45.391 --> 01:03:47.263
- No, I don't.

01:03:49.874 --> 01:03:50.788
Do you like it?

01:03:52.007 --> 01:03:55.314
It's an heirloom from our

01:03:55.401 --> 01:03:59.928

great-grandfather.

01:04:00.015 --> 01:04:00.842

[Madelin laughs loudly]

01:04:03.627 --> 01:04:05.803
- John Jacob Whitman.

01:04:05.890 --> 01:04:06.804
- Oh, wow.

01:04:06.891 --> 01:04:08.545
There's a huge spider down here.

01:04:08.632 --> 01:04:09.589
- [Meg] The banker?

01:04:09.676 --> 01:04:11.591
- His great-grandfather.

01:04:11.678 --> 01:04:12.679
- No, I'm good.

01:04:12.766 --> 01:04:14.246
[alcohol sloshing]

01:04:14.333 --> 01:04:17.249
- John Jacob Whitman was
a merchant and a diplomat.

01:04:17.336 --> 01:04:19.425
He's credited with
opening the port of Canton

01:04:19.512 --> 01:04:20.513
to Western trade.

01:04:26.041 --> 01:04:28.826

01:04:33.875 --> 01:04:34.788
You try.

01:04:39.228 --> 01:04:40.316
- Uh-oh.

01:04:40.403 --> 01:04:41.143
Look what we got here!

01:04:41.230 --> 01:04:41.970
[Madelin gasps]

01:04:42.057 --> 01:04:43.667

01:04:43.754 --> 01:04:45.147
- Play what?
[tense music]

01:04:45.234 --> 01:04:46.278
- Charades.

01:04:46.365 --> 01:04:49.716
- Old rules apply.
[jar rattling]

01:04:49.803 --> 01:04:51.283
- What do I have here?

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:52.284
Okay.

01:04:53.982 --> 01:04:54.896
- One word.

Strangling, strangle.

01:05:15.046 --> 01:05:16.352
Strangle, strangle.

01:05:17.440 --> 01:05:19.007
Scott, I don't... Do something
else, do something else.

01:05:19.094 --> 01:05:19.833
Try something different.

01:05:19.921 --> 01:05:20.834
Try something different!

01:06:04.617 --> 01:06:06.271
How many words?

01:06:06.358 --> 01:06:07.229
Is it a book?

01:06:45.919 --> 01:06:46.790
I'm stumped.

01:06:46.877 --> 01:06:48.183
Meg, you got any guesses?

01:06:49.662 --> 01:06:50.576
Atta girl.

01:06:52.230 --> 01:06:53.144
- So what was it?

01:06:54.754 --> 01:06:55.668
The clue.

01:06:57.670 --> 01:06:58.845
"Easy Rider."

01:06:59.672 --> 01:07:01.848
All right, you're up,
you're up, you're up.

01:07:03.154 --> 01:07:05.069
- That was really
bad "Easy Rider."

01:07:05.156 --> 01:07:08.029
- [Madelin] What did you say?
- That was not good.

01:07:08.116 --> 01:07:10.466
- [Madelin] Maybe you're
just a really bad guesser.

01:07:10.553 --> 01:07:12.555
- Obviously I would've
been on the right track

01:07:12.642 --> 01:07:15.079
if anybody was giving me
anything to work with.

01:07:15.166 --> 01:07:18.474
[both laughing softly]

01:07:19.997 --> 01:07:20.867
[low rumbling]

01:07:20.954 --> 01:07:23.522
[tense music]

01:07:28.353 --> 01:07:29.702
Meg, are you alright?

01:07:29.789 --> 01:07:31.922
Aw, did you get a paper cut?

01:07:33.228 --> 01:07:34.098
- No, I...

01:07:44.630 --> 01:07:45.631
All better.

01:07:48.286 --> 01:07:49.983
How are we looking?

01:07:51.028 --> 01:07:52.595
Here you go.

01:07:52.682 --> 01:07:54.075
I wanna go home.

01:07:55.293 --> 01:07:56.555
Come on, it's just a paper cut.

01:07:56.642 --> 01:07:58.122
[piano tinkling]

01:07:58.209 --> 01:07:59.080
- Scott!

01:08:10.395 --> 01:08:13.529
[bright piano music]

01:08:24.801 --> 01:08:27.368
[tense music]

01:08:48.476 --> 01:08:52.045
[glass clattering loudly]

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:59.574
[piano banging]

01:09:14.111 --> 01:09:16.331
- [Madelin] You alright?

01:09:17.158 --> 01:09:19.551
Meg, you need some water?

01:09:19.638 --> 01:09:20.769
- I wanna go home.

01:09:20.857 --> 01:09:22.466
- Let's go for a swim!

01:09:22.554 --> 01:09:24.339
- What?
- The ocean is right there!

01:09:24.426 --> 01:09:25.340
- It's freezing!

01:09:25.427 --> 01:09:26.428
- Cold water is good for you!

01:09:26.515 --> 01:09:27.645
- No!
- Suit yourself.

01:09:27.733 --> 01:09:28.604
- Talkie?

01:09:28.690 --> 01:09:29.692
- Megan, come on, come on.

01:09:29.778 --> 01:09:30.910
- Scott!

01:09:30.997 --> 01:09:32.956
[door bangs]

01:09:33.043 --> 01:09:36.350
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:09:40.224 --> 01:09:43.358
[water whooshing]
- No, no! [laughs]

01:09:43.445 --> 01:09:44.707
No, it's too cold,
it's too cold,

01:09:44.794 --> 01:09:47.536
it's too cold, it's
too cold! [tense music]

01:09:47.623 --> 01:09:48.492
- [Scott] All right,
you gonna do it?

01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:49.712
- Yeah, yeah!

01:09:50.930 --> 01:09:52.583
One, two, three!

01:09:52.671 --> 01:09:54.717
[Madelin laughing]

01:09:54.804 --> 01:09:55.892
- What is wrong with you?

01:09:55.979 --> 01:09:56.849
- No! [laughs]

01:09:56.936 --> 01:09:57.937
- You wanna play dirty?

01:09:58.024 --> 01:09:59.242
All right.

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:00.592
[Madelin laughing loudly]

01:10:00.679 --> 01:10:02.159
Get in the water!

01:10:04.030 --> 01:10:06.598
[tense music]

01:10:18.915 --> 01:10:19.829
Meg!

01:10:21.309 --> 01:10:23.267
Come on down!
- Join us!

01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:32.276
[Meg breathing heavily]

01:10:37.890 --> 01:10:38.674
[metallic rattling]

01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.633
[engine rumbling]

01:10:50.990 --> 01:10:53.558
[dog barking]

01:11:13.709 --> 01:11:16.407
[loud crashing]

01:11:22.935 --> 01:11:26.287
[Meg breathing shakily]

01:12:22.691 --> 01:12:25.171
[Meg grunts]

01:12:27.348 --> 01:12:30.176
[birds chirping]

01:12:36.965 --> 01:12:39.795
[grass rustling]

01:12:57.116 --> 01:13:00.119
- [Scott] She doesn't seem
to be getting any beter.

01:13:00.206 --> 01:13:02.557
[muffled chattering]

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:05.081
- [Madelin] But you're
doing the best you can.

01:13:05.168 --> 01:13:07.866
There's nothing more you
can do in this situation.

01:13:07.953 --> 01:13:10.782
[birds chirping]

01:13:13.872 --> 01:13:15.308
She needs real help.

01:13:15.396 --> 01:13:18.007
[door scraping]

01:13:18.094 --> 01:13:19.400
- Meg, Jesus Christ.

01:13:19.487 --> 01:13:21.445
Where have you been?

01:13:21.532 --> 01:13:22.403
Are you hurt?

01:13:23.186 --> 01:13:24.709
Where's your coat?

01:13:24.796 --> 01:13:26.189
- I'll make you some tea.

01:13:29.497 --> 01:13:30.411
- [Meg] Get out.

01:13:31.367 --> 01:13:33.108
- Meg.
- Excuse me?

01:13:33.196 --> 01:13:35.067
- Get out.

01:13:35.153 --> 01:13:36.155
- Hey, calm down.

01:13:36.982 --> 01:13:38.723
- Oh my god, get the fuck out!

01:13:38.810 --> 01:13:41.160
- Meg!
- Get out, Madelin! Go!

01:13:41.247 --> 01:13:44.425
[footsteps thudding]

01:13:49.255 --> 01:13:50.169
Goodbye!

01:13:51.823 --> 01:13:53.651
[Madelin sighs]

01:13:53.738 --> 01:13:54.870
- What the fuck is
wrong with you?

01:13:54.957 --> 01:13:56.305
- [Meg] Where are the keys?

01:13:56.393 --> 01:13:57.698
- [Scott] Meg.

01:13:57.786 --> 01:13:59.004
- Where are the keys?

01:13:59.787 --> 01:14:00.963
- [Scott] Meg, what happened?

01:14:01.050 --> 01:14:02.051
- I'm going home.

01:14:02.834 --> 01:14:04.053
- Meg, talk to me,
what happened?

01:14:04.140 --> 01:14:05.184
- I don't know, Scott.

01:14:05.271 --> 01:14:06.577
What could've happened?

01:14:06.664 --> 01:14:07.926
What could've happened
in the last 24 hours

01:14:08.013 --> 01:14:10.059
that would make me
wanna leave you?

01:14:10.146 --> 01:14:11.713
Do you have any fucking guesses?

01:14:12.670 --> 01:14:13.758
- Meggie.

01:14:13.845 --> 01:14:15.499
- Just tell me where
the keys are!

01:14:15.586 --> 01:14:16.935
- Can we just talk about this?

01:14:17.022 --> 01:14:18.459
- I don't wanna talk
about it! I wanna go home!

01:14:18.546 --> 01:14:20.198
- We'll go home, okay?

01:14:20.286 --> 01:14:21.200
We'll go home.

01:14:24.987 --> 01:14:26.858
- You knew she would
be here with us.

01:14:34.126 --> 01:14:37.129
[Meg sighs]

01:14:37.215 --> 01:14:38.696
Is Madelin even your cousin?

01:14:46.008 --> 01:14:48.837
[chair thudding]

01:14:54.885 --> 01:14:56.540
- Madelin is my cousin.

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:05.418
[Meg breathing shakily]

01:15:05.506 --> 01:15:07.376
- Why did you bring me here?

01:15:13.470 --> 01:15:14.384
Scott?

01:15:15.907 --> 01:15:18.910
- I'm trying to be who
you need me to be,

01:15:18.997 --> 01:15:23.175
but I'm out of my depth, Meg.

01:15:25.438 --> 01:15:27.266
You've been having
such a hard time.

01:15:29.268 --> 01:15:32.228
You won't talk to the
doctor, won't talk to me.

01:15:32.314 --> 01:15:34.273
Sometimes it feels like
you're not even really there,

01:15:34.360 --> 01:15:37.668
like you're seeing
something that I don't see.

01:15:37.755 --> 01:15:40.323
[tense music]

01:15:41.629 --> 01:15:43.544
Madelin, She was just
trying to help.

01:15:45.023 --> 01:15:46.416
I needed help.

01:15:46.503 --> 01:15:47.852
You need help.

01:15:47.939 --> 01:15:49.637
You're barely eating,
you're barely sleeping.

01:15:49.724 --> 01:15:51.464
Now with your sleepwalking-

01:15:51.552 --> 01:15:52.553
- Wait, what?

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.383
- It's like living with a ghost.

01:15:57.470 --> 01:15:59.777
[clinking]

01:16:04.956 --> 01:16:06.479
- Oh, no.

01:16:06.567 --> 01:16:09.961
Oh, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

01:16:10.048 --> 01:16:11.746
- Babe, what's happening?

01:16:11.832 --> 01:16:12.703
Tell me.

01:16:14.357 --> 01:16:15.445
- I'm scared.

01:16:15.532 --> 01:16:18.013
[Meg crying]

01:16:23.540 --> 01:16:25.150
- Just calm down.

01:16:25.237 --> 01:16:26.151
It's okay.

01:16:31.374 --> 01:16:32.505
[water trickling]

01:16:32.593 --> 01:16:35.552
I want you to write
this down, okay?

01:16:43.691 --> 01:16:45.430
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:16:45.518 --> 01:16:46.737
That's it.

01:16:46.823 --> 01:16:48.478
That's a good girl.

01:17:07.453 --> 01:17:10.282
[water sloshing]

01:17:24.122 --> 01:17:26.908
[paper rustling]

01:17:51.541 --> 01:17:54.283
[clock ticking]

01:17:58.069 --> 01:18:00.898
[sheets rustling]

01:18:04.597 --> 01:18:07.599
[Meg sighs softly]

01:18:18.263 --> 01:18:19.177
- Scott?

01:18:38.414 --> 01:18:42.853
[footsteps thudding quickly]

01:18:42.939 --> 01:18:45.813
[sheets rustling]

01:18:55.518 --> 01:18:57.259
[doors rattling]

01:18:57.346 --> 01:19:00.218
[fabric rustling]

01:19:01.305 --> 01:19:02.917
Where are the keys?

01:19:05.746 --> 01:19:08.661
[drawer rattling]

01:19:19.063 --> 01:19:21.936
[drawer rattling]

01:19:25.896 --> 01:19:28.203
[rustling]

01:19:33.207 --> 01:19:36.515
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:19:39.257 --> 01:19:41.651
[fabric rustling]

01:19:41.738 --> 01:19:45.046
[Meg breathes heavily]

01:19:49.050 --> 01:19:52.357
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:19:53.271 --> 01:19:56.144
[computer clicks]

01:20:01.714 --> 01:20:04.500
[Meg whimpering]

01:20:04.587 --> 01:20:06.415
Someone please help me.

01:20:06.501 --> 01:20:07.851
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:20:07.938 --> 01:20:10.158
- [Kidnapper] Talk to him.

01:20:12.508 --> 01:20:13.769
- Scott, please.

01:20:17.513 --> 01:20:19.732
They're gonna kill me!

01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:21.212
[Meg screaming]

01:20:21.299 --> 01:20:23.780
[Meg crying]

01:20:25.826 --> 01:20:27.218
[Meg screams]
[tense music]

01:20:27.305 --> 01:20:30.613
[Meg breathes heavily]

01:20:32.528 --> 01:20:33.442
- Minnow!

01:20:40.405 --> 01:20:41.319
Minnow?

01:20:44.932 --> 01:20:45.846
Minnow?

01:20:49.327 --> 01:20:50.241
Minnow!

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:54.985
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:20:55.072 --> 01:20:56.073
[tense music]

01:20:56.160 --> 01:20:58.293
My mother is bedridden.

01:21:49.561 --> 01:21:50.998
[gun clicking]

01:21:51.085 --> 01:21:51.955
Hi, Meg.

01:21:54.218 --> 01:21:56.394
I've been looking for
Minnow all night.

01:21:59.832 --> 01:22:04.533
You'll help me look.

01:22:04.620 --> 01:22:05.534
- Minnow?

01:22:17.024 --> 01:22:18.634
Maybe we should go back.

01:22:22.116 --> 01:22:23.160
- He could be hurt.

01:22:41.657 --> 01:22:42.787
- What are you doing?

01:22:45.965 --> 01:22:47.010
Keep going.

01:22:48.794 --> 01:22:51.144
- It was an accident.

01:22:51.232 --> 01:22:52.885
It was an accident.

01:22:54.452 --> 01:22:55.366
Please.

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:00.981
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:23:25.005 --> 01:23:28.660
[Madelin breathes shakily]

01:23:35.102 --> 01:23:38.061
[loud thudding]
[Madelin grunts]

01:23:38.148 --> 01:23:41.456
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:23:59.039 --> 01:24:04.087
[Meg grunts]
[grass rustling]

01:24:05.741 --> 01:24:08.396
[low rumbling]

01:24:35.510 --> 01:24:37.599
I've been thinking about
your brother.

01:24:40.950 --> 01:24:42.212
It must've been awful.

01:24:45.823 --> 01:24:48.436
And afterwards, your parents
wouldn't talk about it.

01:24:51.308 --> 01:24:52.701
You must've been so lonely.

01:24:55.921 --> 01:25:00.970
And Scott, he was
like a brother.

01:25:04.669 --> 01:25:06.149
And I can understand.

01:25:09.457 --> 01:25:10.719
I'm not your enemy.

01:25:15.115 --> 01:25:17.204
I just need to know
what happened.

01:25:21.599 --> 01:25:22.774
Who hired them?

01:25:25.777 --> 01:25:27.170
Was it you or was it Scott?

01:25:30.912 --> 01:25:31.827
- Fuck you.

01:25:33.655 --> 01:25:36.223
[tense music]

01:25:44.187 --> 01:25:45.796
- What's the plan now?

01:25:47.059 --> 01:25:48.539
Just kill me yourself?

01:25:50.715 --> 01:25:52.717
- Why would I kill you?

01:25:58.419 --> 01:25:59.680
You'll do it yourself.

01:26:03.032 --> 01:26:04.903
You'll never feel normal again.

01:26:06.470 --> 01:26:09.256
How could you, after
what you went through?

01:26:11.432 --> 01:26:14.174
A person doesn't just recover
from something like that.

01:26:16.176 --> 01:26:19.744
It rewires your brain.

01:26:19.831 --> 01:26:24.880
It lives in your body
now, and you'll always,

01:26:26.010 --> 01:26:29.972
always feel this way,
this emptiness,

01:26:38.067 --> 01:26:42.202
like you're watching your life
pass by from behind glass.

01:26:43.507 --> 01:26:46.467
You'll go through the
motions and you'll know

01:26:46.554 --> 01:26:51.559
when you should be happy, but
you'll never really feel it.

01:26:55.084 --> 01:26:59.653
And after a while,
that'll make you bitter.

01:27:03.005 --> 01:27:08.053
You'll resent others for
moving on from something

01:27:08.358 --> 01:27:11.796
that you can never leave behind.

01:27:11.883 --> 01:27:12.796
- [Meg] Shut up.

01:27:13.668 --> 01:27:18.673
- [Madelin] Eventually
you'll just be a burden.

01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:19.935
- Shut up.

01:27:20.022 --> 01:27:21.805
- You can make it all go away.

01:27:21.893 --> 01:27:23.765
It will be a mercy.
- Shut up.

01:27:23.852 --> 01:27:24.809
Shut up!

01:27:24.896 --> 01:27:25.854
- [Madelin] You're broken!

01:27:25.941 --> 01:27:26.898
- Shut up!

01:27:26.985 --> 01:27:28.769
- You can't tell what's real-

01:27:28.857 --> 01:27:30.424
- Shut up!
- And what's just

01:27:30.510 --> 01:27:31.686
a symptom of your
diseased brain.
- Shut up, shut up,

01:27:31.773 --> 01:27:33.992
shut up, shut up, shut up!

01:27:36.385 --> 01:27:37.257
- Madelin?

01:27:42.479 --> 01:27:43.349
Madelin?

01:27:47.483 --> 01:27:48.355
Madelin?

01:27:49.747 --> 01:27:51.358
Oh, god, Madelin!

01:27:51.445 --> 01:27:52.924
Fuck, fuck, fuck!

01:27:53.010 --> 01:27:54.883
Madelin, Maddie, Maddie,
Maddie, Maddie.

01:27:54.970 --> 01:27:56.276
Wake up, wake up, wake up.

01:27:57.189 --> 01:27:58.321
Are you alright?

01:27:58.408 --> 01:27:59.714
- What did you do?

01:28:00.584 --> 01:28:02.107
- You wanted me dead.

01:28:02.194 --> 01:28:03.674
- What the fuck?

01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:06.068
- You made me go
into that garage

01:28:06.155 --> 01:28:07.590
so you could take my money.

01:28:07.678 --> 01:28:08.853
- We have to get her
to the hospital.

01:28:08.939 --> 01:28:09.854
- Because you wanted
me to be with her.

01:28:09.941 --> 01:28:11.595
Meg, you have to help me, okay?

01:28:11.682 --> 01:28:12.379
Help me carry her.

01:28:12.465 --> 01:28:13.902
- I saw the videos!

01:28:13.989 --> 01:28:15.643
- I didn't do anything!

01:28:19.124 --> 01:28:20.604
I don't know who took you!

01:28:26.218 --> 01:28:28.220
- How am I supposed
to believe you?

01:28:37.534 --> 01:28:39.319
[Scott sighs]

01:28:39.406 --> 01:28:40.885
- You never will.

01:28:55.987 --> 01:28:58.947
The first video was
delivered to our apartment

01:29:00.035 --> 01:29:03.517
with a note while I
was still out here.

01:29:05.082 --> 01:29:07.042
I didn't see it for
almost a month.

01:29:12.264 --> 01:29:14.354
I thought you were dead.

01:29:17.444 --> 01:29:18.967
I felt like I had killed you.

01:29:21.535 --> 01:29:23.580
It was another month
before another video came,

01:29:23.667 --> 01:29:28.455
and by that point, I
didn't know what to do.

01:29:28.542 --> 01:29:29.804
I couldn't show the police.

01:29:29.891 --> 01:29:31.675
They were already
investigating me.

01:29:34.069 --> 01:29:37.680
[Scott cries softly]

01:29:37.768 --> 01:29:39.335
I had already lost you, Meg.

01:29:41.076 --> 01:29:42.338
I grieved for you.

01:29:48.474 --> 01:29:49.911
- You grieved for me?

01:29:57.919 --> 01:30:00.921
- I should've told you, I
should've told you, Meg.

01:30:01.009 --> 01:30:02.271
I should've told you.

01:30:02.358 --> 01:30:03.707
I'm so sorry.

01:30:03.794 --> 01:30:05.013
- You grieved for me

01:30:08.364 --> 01:30:09.365
for a month.

01:30:09.452 --> 01:30:12.019
[tense music]

01:30:13.891 --> 01:30:18.722
You grieved for me because
you missed the ransom note,

01:30:18.809 --> 01:30:22.160
because you were here with her.

01:30:22.247 --> 01:30:24.162
- You were already dead.

01:30:24.249 --> 01:30:27.470
- I bet you liked the
attention, didn't you?

01:30:29.516 --> 01:30:33.084
You liked being the handsome
widow on TV.

01:30:33.171 --> 01:30:34.695
- No!

01:30:34.782 --> 01:30:38.046
- Poor Scott Whitman, his
little Asian wife is dead.

01:30:38.916 --> 01:30:41.092
I bet Madelin played
right along.

01:30:41.179 --> 01:30:43.921
She made you feel special,
didn't she?

01:30:45.401 --> 01:30:48.099
- You were already fucking dead.

01:30:50.711 --> 01:30:52.277
- You're a coward.

01:30:58.066 --> 01:31:00.460
[high-pitched whining]

01:31:00.546 --> 01:31:01.461
Scott.

01:31:07.249 --> 01:31:09.425
- I can't live like this.

01:31:10.905 --> 01:31:12.733
It's too much.

01:31:12.820 --> 01:31:14.909
[Meg cries quietly]

01:31:14.996 --> 01:31:15.910
- Please.

01:31:21.916 --> 01:31:22.960
- I'm sorry.

01:31:25.746 --> 01:31:28.183
[gun clicks]

01:31:28.269 --> 01:31:31.751
[loud thud]
[Scott grunts]

01:31:31.839 --> 01:31:34.581
[Meg shouts]
[loud thud]

01:31:34.668 --> 01:31:37.235
[Meg choking]

01:31:43.677 --> 01:31:44.546
I'm sorry.

01:32:04.175 --> 01:32:04.959
[Scott shouts]

01:32:05.046 --> 01:32:07.614
[Meg gasping]

01:32:10.399 --> 01:32:14.142
[footsteps thudding quickly]

01:32:14.229 --> 01:32:18.015
[Meg breathing heavily]

01:32:18.102 --> 01:32:19.016
Meg!

01:32:21.105 --> 01:32:22.019
Meg!

01:32:23.543 --> 01:32:24.892
Get back here, Meg!

01:32:24.979 --> 01:32:27.590
[gun rattling]

01:32:31.812 --> 01:32:32.856
Meg, please.

01:32:34.510 --> 01:32:37.382
I don't know what's
wrong with me.

01:32:40.689 --> 01:32:42.823
I'm such a piece of shit.

01:32:44.738 --> 01:32:47.523
I'm such a fucking asshole.

01:32:47.610 --> 01:32:49.830
[tense music]

01:32:49.917 --> 01:32:52.397
[gun clicks]

01:32:53.268 --> 01:32:54.182
- Meg

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:56.053
- Let me go.

01:32:56.140 --> 01:32:57.010
- Put the gun down.

01:32:58.186 --> 01:32:59.143
- [Meg] Let me go.

01:33:00.448 --> 01:33:01.363
- What?

01:33:03.233 --> 01:33:04.888
I just wanna leave.

01:33:06.411 --> 01:33:09.240
- You're the one with the gun!

01:33:09.327 --> 01:33:11.373
[Scott laughs incredulously]

01:33:11.460 --> 01:33:13.593
[high-pitched whining]

01:33:13.680 --> 01:33:15.420
If you wanna go, go!

01:33:19.250 --> 01:33:20.164
Yeah?

01:33:26.997 --> 01:33:29.783
[water sloshing]

01:33:34.135 --> 01:33:36.703
[Meg gasping]

01:33:42.970 --> 01:33:45.537
[tense music]

01:34:01.162 --> 01:34:02.598
[low rumbling]

01:34:02.685 --> 01:34:05.253
[Meg choking]

01:34:07.864 --> 01:34:10.650
[water sloshing]

01:34:20.876 --> 01:34:23.445
[Meg gasping]

01:34:37.241 --> 01:34:39.722
[Meg grunts]

01:34:49.253 --> 01:34:51.691
[Meg grunts]

01:35:01.483 --> 01:35:05.008
[engine rumbling quietly]

01:35:10.057 --> 01:35:10.971
- Hello?

01:35:14.061 --> 01:35:17.367
[Meg breathes heavily]

01:35:36.082 --> 01:35:39.129
[Meg cries quietly]

01:35:44.744 --> 01:35:45.919
Are you okay?

01:35:46.006 --> 01:35:48.486
[gun clicks]

01:35:49.313 --> 01:35:51.533
[Meg breathes shakily]

01:35:51.620 --> 01:35:53.187
[door thuds]

01:35:53.274 --> 01:35:56.146
[engine rumbling]

01:36:02.283 --> 01:36:04.851
[Meg screams]

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:11.073
[Meg laughs]

01:36:11.161 --> 01:36:13.729
[Meg screams]

01:37:47.388 --> 01:37:49.912
[keys jingle]

01:38:08.365 --> 01:38:09.366
[door thuds]

01:38:09.453 --> 01:38:12.195
[siren wailing]

01:38:22.858 --> 01:38:25.426
[tense music]

01:38:47.665 --> 01:38:50.930
[rhythmic vocalizing]

01:39:42.198 --> 01:39:45.158
[eerie vocalizing]

01:40:37.079 --> 01:40:39.516
[slow music]

01:40:40.474 --> 01:40:43.303
[calm vocalizing]

01:41:01.625 --> 01:41:05.064
[chill electronic music]
