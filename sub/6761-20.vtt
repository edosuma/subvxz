01:42.143 --> 01:43.186
Hi.

01:52.528 --> 01:53.946
Hey, puppy.

01:54.739 --> 01:57.700
Where are you going?
Getting in shape, huh?

01:58.576 --> 02:00.661
Well, you better go home.

02:01.162 --> 02:03.956
Come on, puppy. Go. Go home.

02:04.457 --> 02:07.209
Puppy, go home.
Please, puppy, go home.

02:09.044 --> 02:10.128
Go!

02:10.253 --> 02:13.799
Look, I mean it, get lost.
Go home. Please.

02:13.883 --> 02:16.844
Come on, go home. Go home.
Get out of here.

02:18.262 --> 02:20.306
Damn it, puppy, go home.

02:23.017 --> 02:24.602
- Hey, Dave.
- Hi, Jim.

02:24.685 --> 02:26.353
Meet my expert coaching staff.

02:26.437 --> 02:28.689
- My son, Brandon.
- Brandon.

02:28.772 --> 02:30.191
- How are you, Dave?
- All right.

02:30.274 --> 02:31.358
His friend, Steve Sanders.

02:31.442 --> 02:32.651
- Steve.
- Nice to meet you.

02:32.735 --> 02:33.861
This is Dave Franklin,

02:33.944 --> 02:36.864
<i>the el presidente of the
West Beverly Hills Baseball League.</i>

02:36.947 --> 02:38.824
Today I'm just a regular dad.

02:38.907 --> 02:41.619
- Which one's your son?
- That's Davey over there.

02:41.702 --> 02:44.288
All right. We ought to get him
on our team, Mr Walsh.

02:44.371 --> 02:46.040
Well, I think that can be arranged.

02:46.123 --> 02:48.333
So for the tryouts,
you up to hitting some fungoes?

02:48.417 --> 02:50.002
- Just point me to the bat rack.
- All right.

02:50.085 --> 02:51.545
- Nice meeting you, fellas.
- See you later, Dave.

02:51.628 --> 02:52.671
Bye-bye.

02:52.755 --> 02:54.089
So how tight is your dad with Franklin?

02:54.173 --> 02:55.841
Well, they work together.
Pretty tight, I think.

02:55.924 --> 02:57.551
Well, then you can bet
old Franklin's gonna make sure

02:57.634 --> 02:59.303
his good buddy gets all the best players.

02:59.386 --> 03:00.429
Maybe.

03:00.512 --> 03:03.682
- Say, is your dad any good?
- He loves baseball.

03:03.765 --> 03:06.518
- But is he any good?
- See for yourself.

03:16.737 --> 03:18.572
Oh, I'm sorry, honey,

03:18.655 --> 03:23.618
but if you play without stretching first,
what do you expect?

03:24.369 --> 03:27.497
- A little sympathy?
- For whom?

03:27.956 --> 03:30.709
The ageing jock
who throws out his back every season?

03:30.792 --> 03:34.004
Or the ageing nurse who gets to listen
to her patient moan and groan all week

03:34.087 --> 03:36.423
while she waits on him hand and foot?

03:36.506 --> 03:39.801
Okay, okay.
I'll be back in commission by Monday.

03:41.178 --> 03:45.348
Forget it. Dr Kramer told you
specifically to stay off your feet.

03:45.599 --> 03:49.519
And your children and I are here to
make sure that you take your medicine.

03:51.813 --> 03:54.649
- Oh, poor Daddy.
- Oh, poor Daddy.

03:56.484 --> 03:59.571
What can I say, kids?
Your old man's a stiff.

04:00.030 --> 04:03.283
Brandon, you and Steve, you think you
can run the show for a couple of weeks?

04:03.366 --> 04:06.661
- Teach the kids how to play some ball?
- Probably.

04:07.412 --> 04:10.832
Yeah, I had a pretty good coach
when I was younger.

04:15.003 --> 04:18.130
So, you know, with my dad laid up,
we need all the help we can get.

04:18.214 --> 04:20.800
First practice is today
if you want to join in the festivities.

04:20.884 --> 04:23.428
Thanks, but no thanks, Slim.

04:23.887 --> 04:25.972
Dylan, I thought
you were a total baseball freak.

04:26.055 --> 04:28.308
Oh, I am.
But having to listen to these parents

04:28.391 --> 04:30.810
berating their kids from the sidelines
all day long

04:30.893 --> 04:32.478
brings back a whole slew
of bad memories.

04:32.562 --> 04:34.314
Yeah, but it shouldn't be
about the parents.

04:34.397 --> 04:36.858
It should be about being on a team,
learning fundamentals,

04:36.941 --> 04:38.651
having a good time.

04:38.735 --> 04:41.362
That's very noble, Brandon,
but when I was playing

04:41.446 --> 04:44.157
- it was about winning at any cost.
- It still is.

04:44.240 --> 04:45.616
I know some people from the Valley,

04:45.700 --> 04:48.286
took their kid out of the league
because it was so competitive.

04:48.369 --> 04:52.832
Well, no offence, Andrea, but did this
kid have any athletic ability whatsoever?

04:52.915 --> 04:54.458
Are you kidding?

04:54.542 --> 04:56.502
Avery not only won the batting title,

04:56.586 --> 05:00.423
but was the star pitcher for the entire
West Valley Baseball League.

05:00.548 --> 05:02.049
Well, guys, I hear what you're saying,

05:02.133 --> 05:05.386
but I can promise you that Steve and I
will not run our team like that.

05:05.636 --> 05:08.222
Crawford!
Get your finger out of your nose!

05:08.973 --> 05:10.725
He eats them, too.

05:11.183 --> 05:12.643
Take a lap.

05:13.185 --> 05:14.395
Steve.

05:15.229 --> 05:17.356
Steve, what's the problem?
He wasn't doing anything.

05:17.440 --> 05:19.400
Yeah, he was, he was grossing me out.

05:19.483 --> 05:22.319
Last thing we need
is a booger picker playing second base.

05:22.403 --> 05:23.821
Hi, Steve. Hi, Brandon.

05:23.904 --> 05:25.990
- Davey, you all right?
- Davey, how you doing, large guy?

05:26.073 --> 05:27.658
Hey, you got a new mitt. All right, buddy.

05:27.741 --> 05:29.743
- Yeah.
- Franchise.

05:30.494 --> 05:35.416
Okay, everyone gets a new mitt.
New bats. New helmets. The works.

05:36.083 --> 05:37.835
How sweet it is.

05:37.918 --> 05:40.337
So, when do we get new uniforms?

05:41.297 --> 05:43.549
You don't get a uniform
until you can prove to us

05:43.632 --> 05:46.719
that you could smack the ball
out of the park, you little squeef.

05:46.802 --> 05:48.679
Everyone pile on Noah.

05:50.681 --> 05:52.307
Where did you get all this stuff?

05:52.391 --> 05:55.602
You need anything, you let me know.

06:01.900 --> 06:03.610
It's like he raided
a sporting goods store.

06:03.694 --> 06:07.447
Told you it would pay
to have Franklin's kid on the team.

06:13.912 --> 06:15.956
You are welcome to come in,

06:16.039 --> 06:20.085
but, with my father's back, you're
definitely entering at your own risk.

06:20.752 --> 06:22.504
I think I'll pass.

06:22.879 --> 06:25.007
I think I don't blame you.

06:25.799 --> 06:27.676
- Bye.
- Bye.

06:38.395 --> 06:40.147
What are you doing?

06:40.230 --> 06:42.482
Get away from there.
You're making a mess.

06:42.566 --> 06:45.026
Come on, get out of here.
Go home before I call the pound.

06:45.110 --> 06:47.487
I'm serious. Get out of here.

06:51.658 --> 06:55.287
Oh, don't look at me like that.
I don't even like dogs that much.

07:03.169 --> 07:05.880
You don't even have a collar, do you?

07:07.048 --> 07:10.385
Okay, if I give you something to eat,
will you go?

07:11.636 --> 07:13.471
Do you like bologna?

07:13.888 --> 07:17.475
You like bologna?
Okay, I'll get you some bologna.

07:17.600 --> 07:19.060
Yes, I will.

07:19.602 --> 07:20.937
Let's go.

07:22.939 --> 07:24.816
Okay, Noah, heads up.

07:27.569 --> 07:29.862
Throw it home. Throw it home.

07:31.948 --> 07:35.368
- Look what I got, ma?
- Oh, come on, give me a break.

07:35.868 --> 07:38.621
Noah. Noah. Hey,
don't pull your head out, man, all right?

07:38.705 --> 07:40.415
Yeah, but the ball
didn't get through my legs.

07:40.498 --> 07:42.625
Well, it's 'cause it took a sweet hop.

07:42.709 --> 07:44.669
You don't know
what you're talking about.

07:44.752 --> 07:46.713
- What'd you say?
- You heard me.

07:46.796 --> 07:47.964
Noah!

07:50.049 --> 07:52.343
That's gonna cost you a lap.

07:52.885 --> 07:54.011
Noah!

07:54.095 --> 07:56.013
Snack time, everybody!

07:56.347 --> 07:58.057
Yes! All right.

07:58.224 --> 07:59.392
Noah!

08:03.271 --> 08:05.690
You won't believe
what that kid just said to me.

08:05.773 --> 08:07.900
Yeah, I know he's a real paw,
but he's a good hitter.

08:07.984 --> 08:10.361
- And his mom's Nan Guersy.
- Who?

08:10.820 --> 08:14.490
Our team mother. She brought
this delicious dim sum for the kids.

08:14.657 --> 08:17.702
- You gotta taste these noodles.
- Dim sum?

08:19.286 --> 08:21.330
Can't believe the spread
this woman brought.

08:21.414 --> 08:24.500
She brought Chinese dumplings,
and bottled water, and...

08:24.583 --> 08:28.170
It was amazing. We used to eat
Twinkies back home, remember?

08:28.254 --> 08:31.882
Oh, honey, would it be easier
to eat upstairs?

08:31.966 --> 08:35.970
No, it wouldn't. I have been in bed
all day, and I am going stir-crazy.

08:36.053 --> 08:37.304
I know.

08:40.224 --> 08:44.144
Well, sounds like we've been given
a pretty good ball team.

08:44.311 --> 08:45.980
Well, we got some pretty good players.

08:46.063 --> 08:48.899
I could do without
a lot of the attitude, though.

08:50.192 --> 08:52.278
Well, of course
the first thing these kids are gonna do

08:52.361 --> 08:53.946
is to test your limits.
What do you expect?

08:54.029 --> 08:55.698
Yeah, but you don't understand, Dad,
it...

08:58.283 --> 09:01.662
The league's run a lot differently out
here than it was back home, that's all.

09:01.745 --> 09:04.373
And you've come to this conclusion
after the first day of practice?

09:04.456 --> 09:05.582
Jim.

09:05.666 --> 09:07.668
Well, I don't understand
why he's being so critical.

09:07.751 --> 09:11.213
- And what is all this yelping?
- It sounds like a dog.

09:11.296 --> 09:13.549
That's being tortured in our back yard.

09:13.632 --> 09:15.759
- Where are you going?
- To see what it is.

09:15.843 --> 09:18.053
You are not.
You're supposed to stay off your feet.

09:18.136 --> 09:19.429
- Brandon can see what it is.
- Yeah.

09:19.513 --> 09:20.597
- Jim...
- Mom, it's a dog.

09:20.681 --> 09:22.099
Yeah, I think
we established that, Brenda.

09:22.182 --> 09:23.976
It sounds like it's coming
from the side of the house.

09:24.059 --> 09:25.102
No, it's in the garage.

09:25.185 --> 09:26.687
No, it sounds like the side of the house.

09:26.770 --> 09:29.523
No, trust me, Dad, it's in the garage.

09:34.736 --> 09:38.281
He smells bad. But once you get
to know him, he's really sweet.

09:38.365 --> 09:41.701
- Who does he belong to?
- Us.

09:44.871 --> 09:48.041
Brenda, we can't have a dog
in this house, and that is that.

09:48.125 --> 09:49.251
Why not?

09:49.334 --> 09:52.128
Because I know who's going to be
the one

09:52.379 --> 09:55.590
to walk it and feed it and all...

09:55.674 --> 09:58.802
No. Dad, I don't want you guys
to lift a finger to this dog.

09:58.885 --> 10:00.804
He's completely my responsibility.

10:00.887 --> 10:03.682
Yeah, well, that's what you said
about Ruby.

10:03.765 --> 10:07.519
Ruby was completely untrainable.
I mean, even the vet said so.

10:07.644 --> 10:09.020
And Bruno?

10:09.145 --> 10:12.857
Bruno bit the mailman completely
out of self-defense, and you know that.

10:12.941 --> 10:14.567
Okay. Fine.

10:16.027 --> 10:19.739
- Let's talk about Mr Pepper.
- I knew he'd bring him up.

10:19.823 --> 10:21.032
Jim.

10:21.116 --> 10:24.327
I'm sorry, but someone in this family

10:24.410 --> 10:29.165
left that poor animal outside in the
middle of winter to freeze to death.

10:29.332 --> 10:30.625
I was nine years old!

10:30.708 --> 10:33.753
How was I supposed to know
about wind-chill factors?

10:34.546 --> 10:36.714
Brenda, I think the dog needs you.

10:37.465 --> 10:38.633
Excuse me.

10:38.716 --> 10:41.469
- Brenda.
- Dad, he needs me.

10:41.552 --> 10:45.431
And what I need is for you to take him
to the animal shelter tonight.

10:45.515 --> 10:49.477
I can't do that. If I take him to the pound,
they'll put him to sleep.

10:49.560 --> 10:51.771
Fine, I'll take him.

10:51.979 --> 10:54.273
- Jim.
- Where are the car keys?

10:55.483 --> 10:56.609
Jim!

10:56.818 --> 11:01.572
I'm taking him back
to the pound tonight, and that is that.

11:01.697 --> 11:03.115
No, that is not that.

11:03.199 --> 11:06.369
You're not going anywhere but straight
upstairs and back to bed right now.

11:06.452 --> 11:07.620
- Cindy.
- No.

11:07.787 --> 11:11.666
I can't bear to see you walk around
like the Hunchback of Notre Dame.

11:11.749 --> 11:13.501
And I won't have you barking
at your children

11:13.584 --> 11:15.336
because your back is in spasm.

11:15.419 --> 11:17.338
Now, while
you are upstairs recuperating,

11:17.421 --> 11:19.548
your son is going to post signs
in the neighborhood

11:19.632 --> 11:23.052
- to see if anyone's lost a dog, right?
- No problem.

11:23.135 --> 11:24.845
And until we find its rightful owner,

11:24.929 --> 11:28.099
your daughter will not only take
total responsibility for this animal,

11:28.182 --> 11:30.810
but she will also get rid of it
the moment it becomes a nuisance,

11:30.893 --> 11:33.646
- isn't that right, honey?
- Thanks, Mom.

11:34.188 --> 11:36.273
You're making a big mistake.

11:36.357 --> 11:39.735
Daddy, I promise,
it's going to be totally different this time.

11:39.819 --> 11:41.695
You're all going to love Wally.

11:41.779 --> 11:42.988
- Wally?
- Wally?

11:43.072 --> 11:44.323
Wally?

11:44.406 --> 11:46.825
You won't even know he's around.

12:00.839 --> 12:03.175
- Hey, you're early.
- Actually, I'm late.

12:03.258 --> 12:06.261
And I was kind of hoping
I could switch today for tomorrow.

12:06.345 --> 12:07.554
What's up?

12:07.638 --> 12:10.557
Well, I'm coaching a team for the
West Beverly Hills Baseball League,

12:10.641 --> 12:13.102
and they just handed me
a practice schedule.

12:13.185 --> 12:14.228
Say no more.

12:14.311 --> 12:17.397
You can take as much time as you want
on one condition.

12:17.481 --> 12:21.235
You gotta schedule a couple
of practice games against my kids.

12:21.318 --> 12:22.986
You're a coach?

12:23.070 --> 12:26.114
Yeah. I have been for years.
Mid City Park and Rec Centre.

12:26.198 --> 12:28.242
It's a gas. I love it.

12:28.325 --> 12:30.744
Well, how's your team,
are they any good?

12:31.245 --> 12:33.538
No, they stink, but who cares?

12:34.039 --> 12:35.999
You know, just being out there

12:36.083 --> 12:39.169
is like being part
of a great American tradition.

12:40.212 --> 12:42.839
- You know what I mean?
- Yeah, I do.

12:43.507 --> 12:46.426
Crawford!
What are you, digging for dinosaurs?

12:47.511 --> 12:50.222
- Come on, guys, get your cleats on.
- Right.

12:51.598 --> 12:53.850
We gotta talk to your dad
about trading that kid.

12:53.934 --> 12:55.393
- Forget it.
- Why?

12:55.477 --> 12:56.686
Because when his back's out,

12:56.770 --> 12:59.022
you don't wanna talk to him
about anything. Trust me.

12:59.105 --> 13:00.982
- Then we'll talk to Franklin.
- Franklin?

13:01.066 --> 13:03.860
- Yeah, he said if we ever need anything.
- Steve, I don't...

13:03.944 --> 13:06.196
Hey, the kid is dead weight.

13:09.908 --> 13:12.869
Mr Franklin,
could I have a word with you?

13:17.290 --> 13:19.042
As it turns out...

13:19.334 --> 13:21.628
Have you tried the slouvaki?

13:29.010 --> 13:32.931
Okay, Wally, stay. Stay right... Stay.
Stay right there.

13:34.057 --> 13:37.852
Okay, Wally, come. Come on, Wally.
Come on.

13:38.436 --> 13:40.146
Come on. Come on.

13:40.438 --> 13:42.357
Wally, come here.

13:43.316 --> 13:45.026
Wally, come here.

13:46.361 --> 13:47.946
Wally, come on.

13:50.073 --> 13:52.992
- Let's face it, he's dumb.
- He's not dumb.

13:53.701 --> 13:56.913
He's just going through
a slight separation anxiety.

13:56.996 --> 13:58.247
Brenda.

13:59.791 --> 14:01.667
What's with your dog?

14:03.878 --> 14:07.006
Oh, don't mind him.
He goes crazy for perfume.

14:08.090 --> 14:10.343
I'm not wearing any perfume.

14:14.222 --> 14:15.598
Strike three.

14:15.681 --> 14:17.600
Got to work those corners, Davey.

14:17.683 --> 14:19.977
I know how to throw a curve.

14:20.311 --> 14:23.189
Probably wanna stay away from
that breaking stuff for a couple years.

14:23.272 --> 14:24.690
You don't wanna burn out your arm.

14:24.774 --> 14:28.361
You know, you're the first coach
who's ever told me not to push myself.

14:28.444 --> 14:30.988
Yeah. It's like my dad says,
"What's the rush?"

14:31.864 --> 14:34.617
Davey, hustle up. You're in the cage.

14:35.493 --> 14:37.078
See you later.

14:38.037 --> 14:40.873
Well, it's all set.
Franklin's arranging the trade right now.

14:40.956 --> 14:43.501
- It's a trade.
- What trade?

14:43.584 --> 14:46.170
Crawford for Kenny Kessler.
Don't say anything till it's official.

14:46.253 --> 14:47.463
It may take a week or two.

14:47.546 --> 14:50.132
What if Crawford
doesn't want to be traded?

14:50.257 --> 14:51.592
Who cares? We're gonna rip.

14:51.675 --> 14:55.262
We're gonna have Kenny Kessler
and Davey, Jr in the same rotation.

14:55.346 --> 14:57.765
Forget it, Steve. It's not fair.

14:57.848 --> 14:59.600
It's a done deal.

14:59.892 --> 15:03.062
Look, Franklin's amped about this.
He wants to have a winning team.

15:03.145 --> 15:05.105
Well, then I guess
I'll just have to go talk to him.

15:05.189 --> 15:06.732
Well, what are you gonna say to him?

15:06.815 --> 15:09.693
I'm gonna tell him
to let the coaches run the team.

15:09.777 --> 15:11.904
Brandon, look.

15:12.780 --> 15:15.157
I'm your friend.
You can say anything to me.

15:15.240 --> 15:18.160
But I don't think you wanna offend
the president of the league.

15:18.243 --> 15:20.996
Especially if he's a friend
of your father's.

15:35.677 --> 15:36.887
Wally.

15:38.221 --> 15:40.766
Wally, stop it. Wally, no.

15:41.808 --> 15:43.018
Down.

15:43.143 --> 15:45.520
Wally, you're a bad boy. Down.

15:45.729 --> 15:47.022
Wally...

15:47.606 --> 15:50.609
Wally, no.
You better be quiet now. Stop it!

15:53.820 --> 15:56.615
I cannot keep on making excuses
for you.

15:59.576 --> 16:02.287
Brenda, your father
wants to speak to you.

16:03.413 --> 16:05.540
Mom, Wally's really a sweet dog.

16:05.624 --> 16:09.044
Yeah. Well, tell that to your father.

16:10.545 --> 16:12.422
I don't know why
you have to be so critical

16:12.505 --> 16:14.841
- of everybody involved in this league.
- I'm not, Dad.

16:14.925 --> 16:17.594
Dave Franklin puts in
a lot of hours for you kids

16:17.677 --> 16:19.554
that someone of his clout
doesn't have to spare.

16:19.638 --> 16:20.722
I know.

16:20.805 --> 16:22.849
And I think he deserves
a hell of a lot of credit.

16:22.932 --> 16:24.809
I agree. It's...

16:26.936 --> 16:29.731
I promise I'm gonna find him a home
first thing tomorrow.

16:29.814 --> 16:31.191
Thank you.

16:34.068 --> 16:35.820
And as far as you and I are concerned,

16:35.904 --> 16:38.448
I hope to be seeing a new attitude
coming out of the coaching box,

16:38.531 --> 16:40.617
or it's going to be a long season.

16:41.159 --> 16:44.287
Come on, Wally,
I need you to keep a low profile

16:44.370 --> 16:46.956
until everybody
can get to know you better.

16:47.832 --> 16:52.253
I know it's dark and lonely in here,
but it's the best that I can do.

17:05.141 --> 17:06.601
Okay, Wally,

17:08.269 --> 17:13.107
you stay on the rug, don't make
any noise, and don't chew anything.

17:14.358 --> 17:15.526
Okay.

17:16.569 --> 17:18.613
You're such a good dog.

17:25.578 --> 17:27.288
Good night, Wally.

17:45.222 --> 17:47.725
- Okay, we're gonna have a good time?
- Yeah!

17:47.808 --> 17:49.310
Are we gonna play ball
like we normally do?

17:49.393 --> 17:50.436
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

17:50.519 --> 17:52.980
Let's do it, let's do it. Come on, let's go.
Where's my catcher?

17:53.063 --> 17:55.065
Okay. Here we go.

17:55.691 --> 17:56.734
Okay.

17:56.942 --> 18:00.112
This is pathetic.
They're not even wearing uniforms.

18:00.196 --> 18:01.739
So what? It's a practice game.

18:01.822 --> 18:03.032
They don't look so good, Brandon.

18:03.115 --> 18:06.035
It's okay. They came out here to play,
and that's the important thing.

18:06.118 --> 18:08.162
Now, listen up, you guys.

18:08.454 --> 18:10.873
The way you treat your competition
is a direct comment

18:10.956 --> 18:12.082
on how you play the game.

18:12.166 --> 18:15.002
Good sportsmanship counts big time
with me and my old man.

18:15.085 --> 18:16.712
So let's get off on the right foot.

18:16.795 --> 18:19.548
Let's go out there, let's treat these guys
with some respect, okay?

18:19.631 --> 18:22.217
- Chill for a second, guys. Bran.
- What's up?

18:22.968 --> 18:26.722
Buddy, Franklin doesn't want
Nat's kids using our new equipment.

18:26.805 --> 18:30.893
He just doesn't want any of the stuff
to get broke before the season starts.

18:30.976 --> 18:33.729
You don't have a problem with that,
do you?

18:35.355 --> 18:38.191
- Let's get this practice game going!
- Batter up!

18:44.239 --> 18:45.532
All right!

18:49.202 --> 18:50.704
Come on. Yeah. Come on. Yeah.

18:50.787 --> 18:52.164
Take that! Take that.

18:52.247 --> 18:54.207
- Good man.
- Hurrah!

18:54.583 --> 18:55.792
Run!

19:01.089 --> 19:02.507
All right.

19:05.719 --> 19:08.680
- How many runs you score so far?
- Fourteen.

19:10.473 --> 19:11.558
Come on, guys!

19:11.641 --> 19:14.936
We can do it. We got two outs.
We can get out of this inning. Let's go!

19:15.020 --> 19:16.771
Come on. Heads up!

19:16.855 --> 19:21.151
Okay, routine grounder. You got it.
Easy out.

19:23.528 --> 19:26.990
Come on, Mannie.
Shake it off. You can shake it off.

19:28.116 --> 19:30.660
Hey, doofus, you really eat toads.

19:30.744 --> 19:33.705
You'll throw it better next time, Mannie.

19:35.248 --> 19:38.960
Hey, Cory, hit it to the doofus.
He's a real toad.

19:43.006 --> 19:44.757
- Halt. Time out.
- Time!

19:48.052 --> 19:50.555
Crawford, get in the game for Noah.

19:52.515 --> 19:55.727
- Forget you!
- Get off the field, Noah.

19:56.311 --> 20:00.148
I'm not getting off the field
unless Coach Sanders tells me to.

20:00.231 --> 20:02.317
Hold up a second, tiger.

20:09.949 --> 20:11.325
What's up?

20:11.409 --> 20:13.911
I'm benching Noah. He doesn't deserve
to play with his attitude.

20:13.995 --> 20:16.414
I agree. I just don't think
you wanna humiliate him.

20:16.497 --> 20:18.958
I'm not gonna humiliate him,
I just wanna teach him a lesson.

20:19.041 --> 20:22.336
Yeah, okay,
but I think the timing might be a little off.

20:25.923 --> 20:29.343
Fine. Why don't you coach
the rest of the game by yourself, buddy.

20:29.427 --> 20:30.845
Brandon...

20:32.972 --> 20:34.265
Brandon!

20:39.770 --> 20:42.314
- What happened?
- I don't know.

20:49.905 --> 20:52.658
- Hi, Mom.
- Oh, hi, honey, how are you?

20:53.325 --> 20:55.578
Oh, you know, the same.

20:56.704 --> 20:58.664
I'm sorry about Wally.

20:59.623 --> 21:01.876
Yeah. So what's for dinner?

21:02.543 --> 21:05.296
You didn't have to take him
to the pound, did you?

21:05.379 --> 21:06.922
No, I didn't.

21:07.089 --> 21:09.925
Terrific.
You found a home for him, huh?

21:10.134 --> 21:12.344
Yeah, ours.

21:13.887 --> 21:16.765
- Brenda.
- Mom, I tried. I really did.

21:16.849 --> 21:17.975
I went to the vet.

21:18.058 --> 21:20.644
The receptionist asks, "Hi,
are you looking for a new puppy?"

21:20.728 --> 21:23.981
I said, "No, I have a dog
that needs a home, like, right now."

21:24.064 --> 21:26.984
So she gave me the card
to the Department of Animal Control,

21:27.067 --> 21:31.321
and then she made sure to tell me
that three-quarters of the 190,000 strays

21:31.405 --> 21:33.866
that were brought to the shelter
last year were destroyed.

21:33.949 --> 21:35.909
And then she said to have a nice day.

21:35.993 --> 21:38.579
It's a crime
more people don't neuter their pets.

21:38.662 --> 21:41.498
And the thought of poor Wally
in some alley fending for himself...

21:41.582 --> 21:44.251
It was just too cruel, I just couldn't do it.

21:44.418 --> 21:46.920
- Okay.
- Okay, I can keep him?

21:47.004 --> 21:50.007
No, okay, you can explain
to your father why he's still here,

21:50.090 --> 21:52.843
and then you can tell him about all
the wonderful things you're doing

21:52.926 --> 21:54.845
to find him a new home.

21:54.970 --> 21:56.847
Oh, that sounds fair,

21:57.222 --> 22:00.726
except can you go upstairs with me
to break the news?

22:02.394 --> 22:05.647
You know, I think it might be wise
to just wait a little bit.

22:05.856 --> 22:07.858
I'm not gonna argue with you
anymore, Brandon.

22:07.941 --> 22:11.153
And apparently you're not going to listen
to my side of the story either, are you?

22:11.236 --> 22:12.988
You already told me what happened.

22:13.071 --> 22:15.824
One of your kids got out of line,
you lost your temper,

22:15.907 --> 22:18.410
you stalked off the field
in the middle of a game.

22:18.493 --> 22:22.706
Dad, if you'd have seen the way that
Noah taunted their second baseman,

22:22.789 --> 22:25.542
I guarantee you would've pulled him off
the field in a second.

22:25.625 --> 22:27.502
Maybe. Maybe not.

22:27.961 --> 22:30.463
One thing I can guarantee
is the Brandon Walsh that I know

22:30.547 --> 22:33.133
would've handled the problem
without causing a scene.

22:33.216 --> 22:35.844
Well, I'm sorry I let you down, Dad.

22:35.927 --> 22:38.680
You didn't let me down.
You let your team down.

22:38.763 --> 22:40.515
Dave Franklin called me
from his car phone,

22:40.598 --> 22:43.184
he was so concerned
about the situation.

22:43.393 --> 22:46.104
Maybe I should learn to be
more like Steve,

22:46.354 --> 22:49.524
suck up to the parents,
let the kids do whatever they want.

22:49.607 --> 22:51.734
- Brandon...
- Or better yet,

22:51.818 --> 22:54.612
why don't we just let the kids run
the whole damn team.

22:54.696 --> 22:56.531
Then we can just sit up in the bleachers

22:56.614 --> 22:58.992
and eat tofu hamburgers
with the umpires.

22:59.075 --> 23:00.535
What do you want, Brandon?

23:00.618 --> 23:02.245
You want to quit being a coach,
is that it?

23:02.328 --> 23:04.205
Maybe that'd be best.

23:14.716 --> 23:16.134
All right.

23:16.592 --> 23:18.761
As soon as I'm back on my feet,
and back on the field,

23:18.845 --> 23:20.596
you're free to quit.

23:20.680 --> 23:24.058
But up until then,
I need you to gut it out for me.

23:24.142 --> 23:26.102
How soon will that be?

23:27.770 --> 23:29.647
Hopefully by next practice,

23:30.022 --> 23:33.484
assuming I can get some peace
and quiet around here.

23:35.570 --> 23:37.613
<i>The Peach Pit is closed.</i>

23:39.031 --> 23:40.366
Okay.

23:47.081 --> 23:50.418
- Hey, come on in.
- Hi. I called your house.

23:50.501 --> 23:52.253
Your sister said you might be here.

23:52.336 --> 23:54.338
- All right. Can I fix you anything?
- No, thanks.

23:54.422 --> 23:56.966
I came to talk
about what happened at the game.

23:57.049 --> 23:59.969
Hey, that's yesterday's news. Forget it.

24:01.262 --> 24:03.597
I just can't forget the way
your second baseman looked

24:03.681 --> 24:06.100
after Noah started picking on him.

24:06.183 --> 24:09.979
- Yeah, well, after you left, it got worse.
- What happened?

24:10.896 --> 24:14.358
Well, the very next play,
Mannie made another error,

24:14.900 --> 24:17.152
and he broke down and lost it.

24:17.236 --> 24:19.196
Mannie's a tough case.

24:19.613 --> 24:22.324
He's been in and out of foster homes.

24:22.408 --> 24:24.618
Nothing comes easy for him.

24:24.827 --> 24:28.747
He's just the last little kid
you ever want to see get hurt.

24:30.499 --> 24:33.585
Did anyone even have the courtesy
to come over and apologize to you?

24:33.669 --> 24:36.630
Yeah, your friend Steve came by.
He was very nice.

24:36.713 --> 24:38.257
What'd he say?

24:38.465 --> 24:42.553
Well, he just wondered if we shouldn't
cancel the second practice game.

24:42.803 --> 24:44.304
Great, Steve.

24:44.555 --> 24:46.932
Wait a minute, Brandon,
he's got a point.

24:47.015 --> 24:49.309
We didn't exactly play you head up.

24:49.393 --> 24:51.103
Why? What was the final score?

24:51.186 --> 24:54.481
I don't know. I stopped counting
after the second inning.

24:56.858 --> 24:59.069
I really feel terrible about all this, Nat.

24:59.152 --> 25:01.822
The fact is that my little kids
from the Park and Rec

25:01.905 --> 25:03.073
just weren't ready to compete

25:03.156 --> 25:07.577
against the vast resources of the
West Beverly Hills Baseball League.

25:08.370 --> 25:10.831
Not that I couldn't whip them
into better shape.

25:10.914 --> 25:14.209
But it's just tough to do it all by yourself.

25:15.418 --> 25:19.214
Well, are you in the market
for a feisty third base coach?

25:20.423 --> 25:23.260
Why? You looking to become
a free agent?

25:25.428 --> 25:27.973
I'm a journeyman ball player, Nat.

25:28.390 --> 25:31.935
I go where I'm needed and wanted.

25:38.316 --> 25:41.027
Dad? You're up?

25:41.903 --> 25:43.613
It's a minor medical miracle.

25:43.697 --> 25:46.741
I've got lateral movement again.
I feel almost human.

25:46.825 --> 25:48.243
Hallelujah.

25:48.785 --> 25:52.956
Listen, a lot of things got said last night
that I deeply regret.

25:53.915 --> 25:55.458
And I want you to know how sorry I am

25:55.542 --> 25:57.752
that we're not gonna be
coaching together again.

25:57.836 --> 26:01.256
- Maybe you'll reconsider.
- Maybe.

26:03.174 --> 26:06.344
So why don't you join us?
We're wheeling and dealing.

26:08.346 --> 26:11.224
Come on, we're making a line-up.
Come on.

26:11.683 --> 26:14.060
I'm gonna get some cheese bits.

26:16.938 --> 26:18.648
Brandon, your dad's a great guy.

26:18.731 --> 26:20.692
The three of us could go all the way
this season.

26:20.775 --> 26:23.444
Yeah, especially with Dave Franklin
pulling all the strings.

26:23.528 --> 26:26.697
Look, I'm sorry about the other day.
But we're a team.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.201
- Look, Steve, I was just talking to Nat...
- Great!

26:30.284 --> 26:31.869
Tell them we've had a change of heart.

26:31.953 --> 26:35.248
We definitely want to play those kids
in another practice game.

26:35.331 --> 26:36.874
- Really?
- Absolutely.

26:36.958 --> 26:38.334
All right.

26:39.210 --> 26:41.796
But why the sudden change of heart?

26:42.380 --> 26:45.132
You gotta admit
that if we clobber these nerd balls,

26:45.216 --> 26:47.635
it'll be great for team morale.

26:50.221 --> 26:52.723
Oh, oh, yeah. Yes, he's quiet.

26:53.641 --> 26:56.268
Smart? Very smart.

26:57.436 --> 27:00.606
House trained?
Yeah, I better let you talk to Brenda.

27:00.856 --> 27:03.275
It's a long shot, but go for it.

27:04.276 --> 27:06.112
Cliff, how are you?

27:06.779 --> 27:08.030
Dylan.

27:09.949 --> 27:11.408
So tell me,

27:11.492 --> 27:14.453
how does going to Beverly Hills High
School compare to West Beverly?

27:15.996 --> 27:17.206
Oh, really?

27:17.289 --> 27:19.917
That has got to be the dumbest dog
in the history of dogdom.

27:20.000 --> 27:21.794
Well, you never met Bruno
or Mr Peppers.

27:21.877 --> 27:24.171
He came this close
to getting hit by a truck yesterday.

27:24.254 --> 27:25.881
Listen, man,
do you got some time tomorrow?

27:25.965 --> 27:28.425
You could help me run
a baseball clinic for some of the kids.

27:28.509 --> 27:31.261
B, I told you I have zero interest

27:31.345 --> 27:34.598
in getting involved with a team
from West Beverly Hills.

27:35.140 --> 27:39.978
What if it's to help Nat's kids so they
can beat the team from West Beverly?

27:40.104 --> 27:43.065
Well, that's a different story, isn't it?

27:47.027 --> 27:49.947
See, what did I tell you? Isn't he sweet?

27:50.322 --> 27:51.907
Isn't he great?

27:52.491 --> 27:55.202
And I think he likes you.

27:56.620 --> 27:59.248
Well, yeah, he's a pretty good dog.

27:59.331 --> 28:02.668
Pretty good?
David, he's great and he likes you,

28:02.751 --> 28:04.795
which in your case
ought to count for something.

28:04.878 --> 28:07.756
- And you said you wanted a dog.
- Well, yeah, but...

28:07.839 --> 28:10.634
Know what? I know the smartest thing.
I should have thought of this earlier.

28:10.717 --> 28:12.427
Why don't you just take him
for a couple of days

28:12.511 --> 28:14.137
and see how it works out
between you two?

28:14.221 --> 28:15.263
Look, Brenda, I can't...

28:15.347 --> 28:17.849
But, David, it's just for a trial run.

28:17.933 --> 28:21.144
Just for a couple of days.
Even one night, like tonight.

28:21.228 --> 28:23.897
Take him and then you'd see
what a great dog he is.

28:23.980 --> 28:27.609
- Okay, just one night?
- Absolutely. Whatever you want.

28:28.235 --> 28:31.696
You think you could get me a date
with Kelly Taylor?

28:33.657 --> 28:36.076
Wally, I'll find you a new home.

28:37.118 --> 28:38.536
Just a question.

28:56.513 --> 29:00.558
You know, the improvement from
one week to the next is remarkable.

29:00.642 --> 29:01.976
Oh, yeah.

29:02.602 --> 29:05.146
Kids are showing a lot of promise.

29:05.980 --> 29:10.235
But you still need a pitcher
that can put the ball over the plate.

29:11.903 --> 29:14.781
Yeah. But win or lose,
the most important thing

29:14.864 --> 29:17.867
is how good
the kids feel about themselves.

29:18.576 --> 29:20.828
Absolutely. Totally.

29:21.579 --> 29:25.083
Yeah, I mean in the long run,
that's all that counts.

29:25.500 --> 29:28.086
- Absolutely.
- Totally.

29:33.674 --> 29:35.092
Andrea, hi.

29:35.301 --> 29:37.637
Listen, do you remember the other day

29:37.720 --> 29:39.514
you told me you knew
some kid in the Valley

29:39.597 --> 29:42.016
who was a blue-chip ball player?

29:43.684 --> 29:46.687
Yeah, Avery.

29:52.401 --> 29:54.487
Mom, what are you doing?

29:55.363 --> 29:59.867
Oh, well, it was late, and I didn't know
how long you'd be in the shower.

30:00.493 --> 30:02.328
You like Wally, don't you?

30:02.411 --> 30:04.955
Just didn't want him to go hungry.

30:06.874 --> 30:10.961
He was such a good boy today.
I hardly heard a peep out of him.

30:11.378 --> 30:14.006
- Why is the door open?
- I don't know.

30:21.013 --> 30:23.224
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

30:24.266 --> 30:26.518
- Wally?
- Wally.

30:26.852 --> 30:28.062
Wally!

30:28.729 --> 30:29.980
Wally!

30:31.357 --> 30:33.025
- Wally.
- Wally.

30:34.443 --> 30:35.694
Wally.

30:43.118 --> 30:46.288
I looked on Wilshire.
I looked on Sunset.

30:46.371 --> 30:48.123
I looked down Rodeo Drive.

30:48.207 --> 30:50.167
I looked everywhere. No pooch.

30:50.250 --> 30:52.336
Well, we gave up 20 minutes ago.

30:52.419 --> 30:55.255
- Poor Wally.
- He'll come back.

30:55.464 --> 30:57.674
That's probably
what the last owner said.

30:57.758 --> 31:01.345
Hey, don't worry about him, Bren.
He'll be fine. He's got street smarts.

31:01.428 --> 31:04.848
Brandon, I love Wally,
but that dog has no smarts.

31:06.099 --> 31:08.352
Well, I'm going to miss him.

31:08.518 --> 31:10.479
- Yeah, right.
- No, really.

31:10.562 --> 31:13.690
I got used to the howling.
It put me to sleep.

31:14.775 --> 31:18.737
Speaking of which, this coach needs
some shut-eye before tomorrow's game.

31:18.820 --> 31:19.988
Sounds like a plan.

31:20.072 --> 31:21.198
Night.

31:21.323 --> 31:23.658
- Good night, honey. Sorry.
- Good night.

31:23.950 --> 31:25.368
Good night.

31:32.584 --> 31:33.919
So, Coach,

31:35.003 --> 31:37.964
which dugout are you gonna be
sitting in tomorrow?

31:38.048 --> 31:42.135
I was just helping Nat teach his team
a few of the fundamentals, that's all.

31:42.218 --> 31:43.720
Does Dad know that?

31:43.803 --> 31:46.890
No. And what Dad doesn't know
won't hurt him.

31:47.641 --> 31:51.644
You know something, Brandon,
you're starting to sound like me.

31:52.562 --> 31:54.564
That's a scary thought.

32:08.119 --> 32:09.245
Dad.

32:09.329 --> 32:11.789
Just a quick thing
about tomorrow's game.

32:11.873 --> 32:15.501
You want to ride with me,
or is Steve gonna be picking you up?

32:15.585 --> 32:18.379
Actually, I was gonna ride with Dylan.

32:20.840 --> 32:22.050
Okay.

32:22.925 --> 32:25.678
But I... I'll go with you if you want.

32:27.430 --> 32:29.307
Whatever you prefer.

32:31.976 --> 32:33.686
I'll go with you.

32:38.733 --> 32:40.693
- Night.
- Good night.

32:50.119 --> 32:53.205
- Hey, Coach.
- Nat. Have you met my father?

32:53.289 --> 32:56.000
- I feel like I know him.
- I know the feeling.

32:56.083 --> 32:58.836
You ought to see what I got for the kids.

33:02.131 --> 33:03.215
The Pitts.

33:03.299 --> 33:06.177
Yeah, they got hats, and wristbands,
and... Real jazzy.

33:06.260 --> 33:08.596
- Why two T's?
- They're from Pittsburgh.

33:08.679 --> 33:09.764
Very clever.

33:09.847 --> 33:12.058
Well, if it isn't the walking wounded,
how are you doing?

33:12.141 --> 33:14.560
Hey, Dave, good to see you. Excuse me.

33:16.270 --> 33:21.233
You know, I ordered one for you, too.
Not that I expected you to wear it today.

33:21.734 --> 33:24.361
Not that part of me doesn't want to.

33:24.820 --> 33:27.323
We'll save it for you, my friend.

33:27.740 --> 33:28.991
Thanks.

33:29.867 --> 33:31.035
- Good game, huh?
- Yeah.

33:31.118 --> 33:32.369
All right. Keep it up, Dylan.

33:32.453 --> 33:33.996
All right, you guys,
let's turn a double play now.

33:40.586 --> 33:42.379
Okay, come on, Dukes, listen up.

33:42.463 --> 33:44.631
When I tip my hat, it means bunt.

33:45.007 --> 33:47.718
- When I cross my arms like this...
- Hold it.

33:47.801 --> 33:49.887
Cory, Noah,
we're having a team meeting over here.

33:49.970 --> 33:51.430
You guys wanna tell me
what's so funny?

33:51.513 --> 33:53.056
What? Did someone cut one over here?

33:53.140 --> 33:56.435
They have that peewee doofus
playing second base again.

33:57.186 --> 33:59.146
- You've got it.
- Yeah!

33:59.855 --> 34:02.900
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Listen up.
I said listen up!

34:04.568 --> 34:08.487
You know, everyone's predicting you
guys will be the team to beat this year.

34:08.572 --> 34:11.617
But my take on it is, if you all
don't change your attitude real quick,

34:11.699 --> 34:14.077
it won't matter
how many games you win.

34:14.161 --> 34:17.289
You won't be the champs,
you'll be the chumps.

34:18.706 --> 34:21.626
And the worst part about it is,
you won't even know it.

34:21.710 --> 34:22.918
Come on, Brandon, lighten up.

34:23.003 --> 34:25.255
You gotta admit that kid, Mannie,
is a real klutz out there.

34:25.338 --> 34:28.216
- Where's your sense of humor?
- Where's your sense of humor?

34:28.300 --> 34:29.885
- Can we do it?
- Yeah!

34:29.967 --> 34:31.887
Then let's do it! Let's get in there.

34:31.969 --> 34:34.222
- Come on, let's go!
- All right, boys, let's get into position!

34:34.306 --> 34:35.849
Come on now, let's show some hustle.

34:35.931 --> 34:38.851
Come on! All right, look alive out there!

34:38.935 --> 34:42.022
Hey, Nat.
Nat, this is Avery. Avery, this is Nat.

34:42.105 --> 34:43.188
- Hey.
- Hi.

34:43.273 --> 34:45.317
Wonder what Andrea Zuckerman's
doing here?

34:45.400 --> 34:47.068
Dylan, Dylan, take care, here.

34:47.152 --> 34:49.279
- Give me this, give me this.
- All right, you'll be great.

34:49.362 --> 34:52.239
What's Dylan doing?
Bringing in a ringer?

34:56.619 --> 34:58.455
My God, it's a girl.

34:59.289 --> 35:01.458
Dude, it's a girl.

35:05.962 --> 35:09.174
Poor Dylan, he's really scraping
the bottom of the barrel, huh?

35:09.257 --> 35:11.134
All right, batter up!

35:12.635 --> 35:13.803
All right, Avery.

35:13.887 --> 35:16.055
Come on, you could do it. Come on.

35:17.599 --> 35:18.766
Yeah!

35:21.519 --> 35:23.771
Run! Run!

35:23.855 --> 35:25.106
Go!

35:25.189 --> 35:26.524
Home run!

35:32.405 --> 35:33.740
Home run.

35:39.287 --> 35:40.955
Man, she's good!

35:45.042 --> 35:46.544
Strike three!

35:47.044 --> 35:48.254
Strike three!

35:48.796 --> 35:50.548
Strike three, you're out!

35:51.424 --> 35:53.134
Man, she's great.

35:59.974 --> 36:04.186
Let's go, Brad.
Any little hit, buddy, any little hit.

36:04.270 --> 36:05.771
Strike three!

36:10.151 --> 36:12.820
All right, let's get a rally going.
Let's hear some noise.

36:12.903 --> 36:15.406
Let's get back in the game.
Come on now.

36:15.865 --> 36:19.785
All right, you guys! Two outs!
Last inning! Run on anything!

36:19.910 --> 36:22.288
Come on, Avery. Blow it by him.

36:22.413 --> 36:24.748
Come on, Davey, we need a hit here!

36:25.749 --> 36:27.543
Come on. Hit it good.

36:30.963 --> 36:32.798
Yeah!

36:34.174 --> 36:35.342
Yeah!

36:35.843 --> 36:37.428
Yes! Well done.

36:44.435 --> 36:45.936
Go, go, go, go, go.

36:46.145 --> 36:47.438
Go, boy.

36:52.109 --> 36:53.819
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

36:55.070 --> 36:56.864
- Yes!
- All right!

36:57.906 --> 37:00.909
- Gutsy coaching, young man.
- Thank you, sir.

37:00.993 --> 37:02.578
- You did it.
- Yeah.

37:02.870 --> 37:04.830
Shake it off, Avery, we'll get them.

37:04.913 --> 37:06.915
You suck wind, pitch.

37:06.999 --> 37:09.793
Hey, hey, hey.
None of that, or you can go home.

37:13.922 --> 37:16.633
- Yeah! Run, run!
- Go, go!

37:17.301 --> 37:18.427
Out!

37:19.136 --> 37:22.723
All right, boys, who's next?
Come on, last chance, let's go, let's go.

37:22.806 --> 37:25.392
- Everybody been in the game?
- Not Randy Crawford.

37:25.475 --> 37:26.852
Crawford, get in right field.

37:26.935 --> 37:28.979
- Come on, let's go!
- Come on, let's show them! Come on.

37:29.062 --> 37:31.773
Mr Walsh, did you forget
we're gonna trade Randy next week?

37:31.857 --> 37:34.818
That's next week,
this week he's in right.

37:34.943 --> 37:36.236
All right, come on now!

37:36.319 --> 37:38.196
- Come on, guys, let's go!
- Let's get them!

37:38.280 --> 37:39.531
This is it!

37:39.614 --> 37:41.867
You battled back, all right.

37:41.950 --> 37:44.619
Thanks to Davey, clutch hitting,
power pitching. He's got it all.

37:44.703 --> 37:47.706
Thanks. He really enjoys
playing with his friends.

37:47.789 --> 37:49.165
You know, it'd be a shame to win it

37:49.249 --> 37:52.335
with Tim Bosworth's son
sitting on the bench.

37:52.460 --> 37:54.879
It's just a practice game, Dave.

37:55.171 --> 37:58.133
Yeah, well, it's your decision.
You're the manager.

38:01.970 --> 38:03.763
Wait for your pitch!

38:05.598 --> 38:08.518
All right, Avery, you're our last chance!

38:13.273 --> 38:16.526
Okay, Davey, okay, bear down now,
bear down now.

38:17.110 --> 38:18.444
Let's go, pitch!

38:18.736 --> 38:20.321
Come on, Avery!

38:20.405 --> 38:21.614
Hold on, now.

38:24.409 --> 38:25.577
Yeah.

38:28.371 --> 38:30.873
All right, Avery, one down.
Heads up now.

38:30.957 --> 38:32.917
You want to settle him down?

38:38.464 --> 38:40.591
All right, listen up, Davey.

38:40.675 --> 38:44.679
You're a pitcher of record, man. Win or
lose, you tossed a hell of a game.

38:47.849 --> 38:50.268
There's no pressure here, buddy.

38:50.768 --> 38:52.270
Go get them.

38:52.353 --> 38:54.188
- Go get the game.
- Come on.

38:54.272 --> 38:55.940
- Here we go.
- Come on, doofus.

38:56.023 --> 38:58.192
Come on.

38:58.276 --> 39:00.194
Come on, Davey, come on.

39:00.486 --> 39:01.529
Strike three, you're out.

39:01.612 --> 39:02.697
All right, that's it.

39:02.780 --> 39:05.324
Way to go, Davey. Yeah.

39:05.533 --> 39:08.536
You concentrate, you can do it. Right?

39:08.619 --> 39:12.164
You can hit this ball.
There's no guessing, you're gonna do it.

39:12.248 --> 39:15.126
You got it on nice and tight, tough guy.

39:15.209 --> 39:16.585
Take a swing.

39:16.919 --> 39:18.629
What's so funny?

39:19.005 --> 39:20.339
- Time out!
- Time!

39:21.924 --> 39:24.760
Hey, guys, come on in.
Gather around here.

39:26.887 --> 39:29.682
All right, guys, come in here. Listen up.

39:29.807 --> 39:31.684
Here's my predictions.

39:32.393 --> 39:35.437
I predict he'll strike out in three pitches,

39:36.564 --> 39:38.524
and I predict that no one on this team

39:38.607 --> 39:41.694
is gonna try to make him
feel bad about that.

39:42.903 --> 39:44.780
This kid's had a tough life.

39:44.863 --> 39:46.615
And there's no reason on earth
why any of you

39:46.699 --> 39:49.201
should try to make it any harder on him.

39:51.120 --> 39:53.872
And having said that, let's play ball.

39:54.748 --> 39:56.083
Let's go!

39:57.209 --> 40:01.088
All right, Mannie,
tag this one, baby, he ain't got nothing.

40:01.171 --> 40:03.882
You can blow it by this doofus, Davey.

40:04.091 --> 40:07.594
The doofus on wheels!
Give it up, doofus!

40:07.678 --> 40:10.931
Hey, peewee doofus,
the bat looks kind of heavy.

40:11.348 --> 40:15.519
Hey, doofus, give it up.
Give it up, doofus!

40:16.436 --> 40:19.231
Hey, peewee doofus, don't drop the bat.

40:19.815 --> 40:22.317
<i>The way you treat your competition
is a direct comment</i>

40:22.401 --> 40:23.610
<i>on how you play the game.</i>

40:23.694 --> 40:25.529
Give it up, doofus!

40:28.156 --> 40:29.783
- Go.
- Go.

40:55.684 --> 40:58.311
- Second base, second base.
- Yeah!

40:59.271 --> 41:00.313
Yeah!

41:07.362 --> 41:08.530
Yeah!

41:17.914 --> 41:20.083
- Not bad, little buddy.
- Yes!

41:24.170 --> 41:27.632
All right, all right!

41:29.008 --> 41:31.469
Bosworth's kid
would have caught that ball.

41:31.553 --> 41:34.764
We should have caught that ball!
We should have won this game!

41:34.847 --> 41:38.268
Hey, Davey, don't look now,
but we did win the game.

41:38.559 --> 41:40.478
Two, four, six, eight.

41:40.561 --> 41:42.230
Who do we appreciate?

41:42.313 --> 41:46.693
The Pitts! The Pitts! Yeah! The Pitts!

41:48.903 --> 41:50.530
Good game, guys.

41:51.614 --> 41:54.575
So how's it feel to be
the pitcher of record?

41:55.952 --> 41:57.161
Yeah!

41:58.496 --> 41:59.956
Feels great.

42:05.294 --> 42:07.255
It was just a practice game.

42:07.338 --> 42:09.757
It doesn't matter
if you lose a practice game.

42:09.840 --> 42:13.552
I mean, it was just a practice game.
Doesn't even count.

42:13.636 --> 42:16.222
Noah, it counts.

42:17.765 --> 42:19.600
Hey, Bran, wait up.

42:27.566 --> 42:30.152
Hey, buddy,
don't be so hard on yourself.

42:30.611 --> 42:33.656
Daryl Strawberry
couldn't have caught that ball.

42:33.739 --> 42:37.159
Poor kid. He gave it his best shot.

42:39.870 --> 42:42.331
Wally? Wally!

42:42.414 --> 42:44.708
Wally, come here.
Dylan, look, Wally's back.

42:44.792 --> 42:47.336
Wally! That's my dog.

42:48.587 --> 42:50.464
Wally's back. Come here.

42:51.799 --> 42:53.342
Oh, Wally.

42:53.425 --> 42:55.636
Wally. Wally. Wally?

42:58.055 --> 42:59.306
Wally!

42:59.390 --> 43:01.558
Hey, is that Brenda's dog?

43:03.102 --> 43:04.144
Wally?

43:04.478 --> 43:06.897
That's not Wally, that's Ruppert.

43:06.980 --> 43:09.024
That's my dog. Oh, he's back.

43:10.234 --> 43:12.736
I thought you were dead, Ruppert.

43:13.237 --> 43:14.530
Ruppert?

43:16.532 --> 43:19.243
Hey, Noah, what'd your mom bring
for a snack?

43:20.160 --> 43:22.746
Spinach salad and warm goat cheese.

43:23.455 --> 43:26.750
- How about a Twinkie?
- Great!

43:27.709 --> 43:28.961
Come on.

43:31.588 --> 43:34.091
Hey, buddy,
we'll get him next time, huh?

43:35.300 --> 43:38.261
Hey, Coach, let's go home.

43:38.720 --> 43:40.597
All right, large guy.

43:41.723 --> 43:43.475
See you next week.

43:46.311 --> 43:47.479
Yeah.
