11:51.252 --> 11:52.586
- GOOD NIGHT, HAPPY.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.463
- [growls]
YOU TOO.

11:54.547 --> 11:56.507
[farts]

11:58.134 --> 11:59.385
- I'M NOT THE ONE WHO NEEDS
A NASAL STRIP, FINGER.

11:59.468 --> 12:03.472
YOU'RE THE ONE WHO SNORES.

12:03.556 --> 12:05.474
COME ON.
BACK ME UP, MOM.

12:05.558 --> 12:07.643
- UH, GOOD NIGHT, HONEY.

12:07.726 --> 12:12.565
- FINE.
COMPROMISE?

12:12.648 --> 12:13.816
[chimes jingle]

12:13.899 --> 12:14.775
- [teeth chattering]

12:14.859 --> 12:16.152
EIGHT HOURS TILL SUNRISE.

12:16.235 --> 12:17.611
EIGHT HOURS TILL SUNRISE.

12:17.695 --> 12:18.529
EIGHT HOURS TILL--

12:18.612 --> 12:20.823
- OKAY, BEN, LIGHTS OUT.

12:20.906 --> 12:24.285
TONIGHT YOU'RE GONNA STAY
IN YOUR OWN BED, RIGHT?

12:24.368 --> 12:25.995
- [whimpers]

12:26.078 --> 12:28.372
- BECAUSE FIVE NIGHTS
IN YOUR OWN BED

12:28.456 --> 12:31.625
EQUALS ONE ICE CREAM CONE.

12:31.709 --> 12:33.169
- WITH REAL ICE CREAM?

12:33.252 --> 12:34.503
NOT SOY?

12:34.587 --> 12:35.754
- UH-HUH.

12:35.838 --> 12:36.464
READY?

12:36.547 --> 12:42.928
- FIVE, FOUR, THREE, TWO...

12:43.012 --> 12:44.305
OOH!

12:44.388 --> 12:46.223
KEEP IT TOGETHER, BEN.

12:46.307 --> 12:48.684
BIG MAN, BIG MAN.

12:48.767 --> 12:49.727
[creaking sound]

12:49.810 --> 12:50.686
[gasps]

12:50.769 --> 12:52.021
IT'S A BOOGEYMAN!

12:52.104 --> 12:54.732
[screams]

12:54.815 --> 12:57.985
BESSIE, THERE'S A BOOGEYMAN
IN MY ROOM,

12:58.068 --> 13:00.446
ON MY BED
NEAR MY PILLOW!

13:00.529 --> 13:02.114
- BEN, BEN, BEN,
BEN, BEN.

13:02.198 --> 13:03.199
BENJAMIN.

13:03.282 --> 13:05.075
A BOOGEYMAN?

13:05.159 --> 13:05.659
- WHAT?

13:05.743 --> 13:07.536
BOOGEYMEN ARE REAL.

13:07.620 --> 13:10.331
ASK MR. PANTS.

13:10.414 --> 13:13.292
- OH, NO ONE'S SAYING
THEY AREN'T REAL.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.543
[light clicks]

13:14.627 --> 13:16.754
BOOGEYMEN ARE VERY REAL.

13:16.837 --> 13:18.047
LET'S SEE.

13:18.130 --> 13:21.383
BIGFOOT, NESSIE, VAMPIRE BATS,
VAMPIRE RABBITS...

13:21.467 --> 13:24.345
AH, HERE WE GO,
BOOGEYMEN.

13:24.428 --> 13:25.721
MADE OF BOOGERS,
EAR WAX, AND FUR BALLS,

13:25.804 --> 13:29.058
THESE BEASTS USE
THEIR MANY HOOKS AND CLAWS

13:29.141 --> 13:32.603
TO STEAL KIDS' BOOGERS.

13:32.686 --> 13:33.521
- [gasps]

13:33.604 --> 13:35.231
- LISTEN.
YOU MUST HEAR.

13:35.314 --> 13:36.315
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT.

13:36.398 --> 13:40.152
HOWEVER, BOOGEYS NEVER TRAVEL
THIS FAR SOUTH.

13:40.236 --> 13:41.654
THEY'RE
A COLD CLIMATE MONSTER.

13:41.737 --> 13:43.239
THEY MOSTLY HAUNT WISCONSIN,

13:43.322 --> 13:45.199
SINCE IT HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER
OF RUNNY NOSES PER CAPITA.

13:45.282 --> 13:49.078
- BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE HAVING
UNSEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES.

13:49.161 --> 13:50.871
POSSIBLY THEY'VE MIGRATED.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.248
- HMM.
UNLIKELY.

13:52.331 --> 13:52.790
BUT TELL YOU WHAT.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.666
I'LL SWEEP THE HOUSE

13:53.749 --> 13:55.417
FOR ANY SIGNS
OF BOOGEY ACTIVITY.

13:55.501 --> 13:57.419
- YOU CAN DO THAT?

13:57.503 --> 13:58.420
- OF COURSE.

13:58.504 --> 14:01.298
THANKS TO MY TOTALLY AWESOME
MAMMALIAN-BASED

14:01.382 --> 14:03.342
MONSTER DETECTION
AND DEFENSE KIT.

14:03.425 --> 14:04.051
- WOW.

14:04.134 --> 14:06.345
WHERE DID
YOU GET ALL THIS?

14:06.428 --> 14:08.055
- OH, JUST A LITTLE SOMETHING
I THREW TOGETHER

14:08.138 --> 14:11.100
THE FIRST TIME I TRIED TO EARN
THE MONSTER SQUAD BADGE.

14:11.183 --> 14:12.101
BUT DESPITE
MY BEST EFFORTS,

14:12.184 --> 14:14.937
I COULD NEVER NAIL DOWN
AN EXACT LOCATION

14:15.020 --> 14:17.481
FOR EL CHUPACABRA.

14:17.565 --> 14:18.607
NOW COME ON.

14:18.691 --> 14:20.568
LET'S BOOGEY.

14:20.651 --> 14:21.777
AH, "LET'S BOOGEY."

14:21.860 --> 14:22.695
YOU HEAR THAT?

14:22.778 --> 14:23.153
AH, THAT WAS A JOKE I MADE.

14:23.237 --> 14:27.366
[sighs]

14:27.449 --> 14:29.785
GOT TO SAY, I'M NOT FINDING
ANY BOOGEY FIBERS IN HERE.

14:29.868 --> 14:30.786
[gasps] GAH!

14:30.869 --> 14:31.787
- WHAT?

14:31.870 --> 14:33.831
- UH, BEN?

14:33.914 --> 14:37.960
- SOMETIMES I LIKE
TO FEEL HANDSOME; SO WHAT?

14:38.043 --> 14:39.753
- SURE, YEAH.
NO JUDGMENTS.

14:39.837 --> 14:42.464
NOW, IF YOU SAID
YOU SAW A SEA SERPENT,

14:42.548 --> 14:43.340
THEN I'D BE ALARMED.

14:43.424 --> 14:46.093
THIS CITY IS LOUSY
WITH SEA SERPENTS.

14:46.176 --> 14:49.555
BUT BOOGEYS
ARE RARE AT OUR LATITUDE.

14:49.638 --> 14:50.472
SEE?

14:50.556 --> 14:51.307
JUST HAPPY'S FUR.

14:51.390 --> 14:52.474
WAIT A SEC.

14:52.558 --> 14:57.062
HMM, BLACK FUR?

14:57.146 --> 14:58.814
THAT'S STRANGE.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.274
- [moaning]

15:00.357 --> 15:01.108
- BUT IT COULD BE ANYTHING,

15:01.191 --> 15:03.819
LIKE MAYBE HAPPY
HAD A FRIEND OVER,

15:03.902 --> 15:06.113
OR HE'S EXPERIMENTING
WITH FUR DYE,

15:06.196 --> 15:07.615
OR, HEY, MAYBE
HE WAS BRUSHING SOME RATS.

15:07.698 --> 15:10.659
YEAH, YEAH, RATS.
THAT'S IT.

15:10.743 --> 15:11.493
HA.
RIGHT, YEAH.

15:11.577 --> 15:15.998
[chuckles nervously]

15:16.081 --> 15:20.336
[sighs] I'M SURE THAT BLACK FUR
WAS JUST CIRCUMSTANTIAL.

15:20.419 --> 15:21.545
RIGHT, BEN?

15:21.629 --> 15:22.504
BEN?

15:22.588 --> 15:23.505
- [screams]

15:23.589 --> 15:26.091
[echoing growl]

15:26.175 --> 15:28.427
[both screaming]

15:28.510 --> 15:30.763
- OH, WELL, YOU KNOW
HOW THE PLUMBING IS

15:30.846 --> 15:32.890
IN THESE OLD BUILDINGS.

15:32.973 --> 15:33.432
OH, OKAY, I'M NOT GONNA
SUGARCOAT IT.

15:33.515 --> 15:35.601
THAT WAS FREAKY

15:35.684 --> 15:37.853
B-BUT--
BUT STILL INCONCLUSIVE.

15:42.775 --> 15:43.692
[objects crashing]

15:43.776 --> 15:46.695
BEN,
CALM--GULP--DOWN.

15:46.779 --> 15:50.032
EXPERTS AGREE THAT BOOGEYS
NEVER USE THE FRONT DOOR,

15:50.115 --> 15:52.451
NOT THAT WE EVEN HAVE BOOGEYS
NEAR OUR HOUSE.

15:52.534 --> 15:57.289
[screeching]

15:57.373 --> 15:58.540
[high-pitched screeching]

15:58.624 --> 16:00.542
- [groans]

16:07.508 --> 16:08.550
- PHEW.

16:08.634 --> 16:11.136
FOR A SECOND THERE,
I WAS EXPECTING TO FIND A--

16:11.220 --> 16:12.554
[thunder crashes]

16:12.638 --> 16:14.473
[screaming]

16:14.556 --> 16:16.392
BOOGEYMAN!

16:16.475 --> 16:18.477
- [screams]

16:18.560 --> 16:19.770
- AH-LA-LA-LA-LA.
DON'T SCREAM.

16:19.853 --> 16:20.688
- WHY?

16:20.771 --> 16:21.939
DO THEY FEED ON SCREAMS?

16:22.022 --> 16:23.399
- NO, I JUST WANT YOU

16:23.482 --> 16:26.902
TO HOLD ON TO A SHRED
OF SELF-RESPECT.

16:26.985 --> 16:28.779
WE JUST NEED TO FOLLOW
THE <i> HONEYBEE HANDBOOK'S</i>

16:28.862 --> 16:31.448
SIMPLE STEPS
TO MONSTER SURVIVAL,

16:31.532 --> 16:34.076
WHICH WILL ALSO EARN ME
MY MONSTER SQUAD BADGE.

16:34.159 --> 16:35.035
FINALLY.
SEE?

16:35.119 --> 16:36.161
SILVER LINING.

16:36.245 --> 16:37.413
OKAY, LET'S SEE.

16:37.496 --> 16:39.998
"STEP ONE:
FIND EVIDENCE OF THE MONSTER."

16:40.082 --> 16:40.332
[shudders]

16:40.416 --> 16:41.458
CHECK.

16:41.542 --> 16:44.420
- WHAT'S STEP TWO?

16:44.503 --> 16:45.838
- SECURE THE PERIMETER.

16:45.921 --> 16:46.797
[cans clanking]

16:46.880 --> 16:49.258
WINDOW ALARMS, CHECK.

16:49.341 --> 16:50.759
[bubble wrap popping]

16:50.843 --> 16:53.470
STEP THREE:
SET TRAPS,

16:53.554 --> 16:55.597
HUMANE TRAPS.

16:55.681 --> 16:57.474
EVEN BOOGEYMEN
HAVE MOTHERS.

16:57.558 --> 16:59.184
STEP FOUR:
ARM YOURSELF.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.144
[both shouting]

17:00.227 --> 17:03.439
STEP FIVE:
EXPLOIT YOUR ENEMY'S WEAKNESS.

17:03.522 --> 17:07.651
FOR BOOGEYS,
IT'S TISSUES.

17:07.734 --> 17:09.278
- REALLY, TISSUES?

17:09.361 --> 17:10.279
- OH, YEAH.

17:10.362 --> 17:11.613
BOOGEYS HATE TISSUES,

17:11.696 --> 17:14.282
ESPECIALLY
THE ONES WITH LOTION.

17:14.366 --> 17:17.118
AND THE FINAL STEP,
WE WAIT.

17:17.202 --> 17:21.665
- SO HAS ANYONE EVER EARNED
THIS MONSTER SQUAD BADGE?

17:21.749 --> 17:23.791
- NO ONE WHO LIVED
TO TELL ABOUT IT.

17:23.876 --> 17:26.086
YOUR TURN.

17:26.170 --> 17:27.128
[doorbell rings]

17:27.212 --> 17:27.755

17:27.838 --> 17:30.716
- WOW, UH, THE DOORBELL.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.551
THAT'S FORWARD.

17:32.634 --> 17:33.385
CLEARLY
WE'RE DEALING WITH

17:33.469 --> 17:34.470
SOME HIGHLY AGGRESSIVE
BOOGEYMEN,

17:34.553 --> 17:42.352
WHICH MEANS IT'S TIME
FOR PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFARE.

17:42.436 --> 17:43.645
[clears throat]

17:43.729 --> 17:45.647
UH, HEY, MY FELLOW BOOGS.

17:45.731 --> 17:47.941
UH, I'M A BOOGEYMAN,

17:48.025 --> 17:50.194
AND I ALREADY CALLED DIBS

17:50.277 --> 17:51.320
SO BEAT IT.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.863
UH, TRY SOMEPLACE ELSE--

17:52.946 --> 17:55.324
I DON'T KNOW,
LIKE--LIKE CANADA.

17:55.407 --> 17:57.826
[both screaming]

17:57.910 --> 17:59.036

18:08.420 --> 18:10.130
- THEY GOT ME!

18:10.214 --> 18:12.174
OH, GOOD-BYE, WORLD.

RETREAT!

18:18.639 --> 18:21.892

18:21.975 --> 18:25.187

I WAS THIS STRONG!

18:25.270 --> 18:26.480
- YOU'RE NOT!
YOU'RE NOT!

18:26.563 --> 18:28.106
IT'S THE ADRENALINE.

18:28.190 --> 18:34.238
[rustling footsteps]

18:34.321 --> 18:37.241
- [yelps] THE BOOGEYS
ARE INSIDE THE HOUSE,

18:37.324 --> 18:39.785
AND THEY BROUGHT
A SOUNDTRACK.

18:39.868 --> 18:41.954
- [sobs]
BEN.

18:42.037 --> 18:43.705
BEN,
YOU SHOULD KNOW SOMETHING.

18:43.789 --> 18:44.957
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.375
I'M THE ONE WHO ATE
YOUR BROWNIE BOTTOM PIE,

18:46.458 --> 18:48.836
NOT HAPPY.

18:48.919 --> 18:52.381
- OH, BESSIE.
I KNEW THAT ALL ALONG.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.132
AND YOU SHOULD KNOW

18:54.216 --> 18:55.551
HAPPY DIDN'T
CHEW UP YOUR SHOES.

18:55.634 --> 19:00.806
IT WAS ME.
[sobs]

19:00.889 --> 19:03.433
[woman screams]

19:03.517 --> 19:06.186
OH, NO!
THEY GOT MOM!

19:11.692 --> 19:13.986
[bang on door]

19:14.069 --> 19:16.572
- ALL RIGHT, I'M THE ACTING HEAD
OF THIS FAMILY NOW,

19:16.655 --> 19:18.448
AND I'M NOT GONNA
SIT HERE LIKE A VICTIM.

19:18.532 --> 19:21.034
- AWW, WELL, THEN,
CAN I SIT HERE LIKE A VICTIM?

19:21.118 --> 19:22.035

19:22.119 --> 19:25.372
BEN, TISSUES, STAT!

19:29.626 --> 19:31.253
TAKE THAT AND THAT

OH, BOY,
THESE ARE HARD TO THROW.

19:31.879 --> 19:34.381
AND THIS AND THAT!

19:34.464 --> 19:38.969
THIS BOX IS FAMILY-SIZED,
SO I CAN TISSUE YOU ALL NIGHT!

19:39.052 --> 19:44.141
- AH-HA!

19:48.020 --> 19:49.354
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

19:49.438 --> 19:52.024
- OH.
YOU'RE NOT BOOGEYMEN.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.610

WAIT, WHY ARE YOU
WEARING TISSUES?

20:03.952 --> 20:05.787
- LOOK, I'LL EXPLAIN LATER.

20:05.871 --> 20:06.747
I CAN'T TALK RIGHT NOW

20:06.830 --> 20:07.789
BECAUSE BOOGEYMEN
ARE INVADING THE HOUSE.

20:07.873 --> 20:08.790
WE HEARD SCRATCHING...

20:08.874 --> 20:10.584
[high-pitched screeching]

20:10.667 --> 20:14.129
AND HOWLING.

20:14.212 --> 20:17.966

20:18.050 --> 20:22.304
[howls]

20:22.387 --> 20:23.138
[growls]
LIKE THAT?

20:23.221 --> 20:24.348
- YES, EXACTLY LIKE THAT.

20:24.431 --> 20:25.974
YOU DO AN AMAZING
BOOGEYMAN IMPRESSION.

20:26.058 --> 20:28.644
- [groans]

20:28.727 --> 20:31.480
WILL YOU CLAM UP
AND LET ME TALK?

20:31.563 --> 20:32.397
- UGH, FINE, HAPPY.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.524
BUT I'M BATTLING
A HOME INVASION HERE,

20:34.608 --> 20:35.734
SO MAKE IT QUICK.

20:35.817 --> 20:40.530

IT REALLY HAPPENED.

20:40.614 --> 20:43.951
- UH-HUH, YOU FORGOT THE KEY

20:44.034 --> 20:47.955

[howls]

20:48.038 --> 20:48.956
- SO YOU HOWLED
AND SCRATCHED AT THE WINDOWS

20:49.039 --> 20:53.168
TO BE LET BACK INSIDE?

20:53.251 --> 20:55.504
- [growls] THEN I SAW
OUR NEIGHBORS.

20:55.587 --> 20:56.880
- UH-HUH.

20:56.964 --> 20:58.090
THEN YOU RAN INTO
OUR NEIGHBORS

20:58.173 --> 21:00.092
AND ASKED THEM TO HELP YOU MAKE
AN EVEN BIGGER RACKET?

21:00.175 --> 21:02.010
[knocking on door]

21:02.094 --> 21:05.180
WHICH FINALLY WOKE UP MOM,
WHO LET YOU GUYS INSIDE.

21:05.263 --> 21:06.264
HMM, YES,
THAT MIGHT EXPLAIN AWAY

21:06.348 --> 21:09.518
20%, EVEN 30%
OF OUR BOOGEY EVIDENCE.

21:09.601 --> 21:13.146
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE STOMPING
AND THE CREEPY PIANO SOUNDS

21:13.230 --> 21:13.522
AND THIS?

21:13.605 --> 21:15.607
both: EEK!

21:15.691 --> 21:19.861
- [sighs]

21:19.945 --> 21:21.321
DARREN, LUCILLE.

21:21.405 --> 21:23.115
- OH, YOU DON'T
HAVE TO INTRODUCE ME, HAPS.

21:23.198 --> 21:25.117
I'VE MET THE RETIRED
CIRCUS PERFORMERS

21:25.200 --> 21:27.703
WHO RECENTLY MOVED IN
NEXT DOOR:

21:27.786 --> 21:30.622
LUCILLE, THE BEARDED LADY
WHO PLAYS PIANO,

21:30.706 --> 21:34.543
AND HER PARTNER, DARREN,
THE MAN WITH HOOKS FOR HANDS.

21:34.626 --> 21:36.545
OH, BOY.

21:36.628 --> 21:37.713
THIS IS AWKWARD.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.047
OOPS.
HEH.

21:39.131 --> 21:41.008

21:41.091 --> 21:44.511

21:44.594 --> 21:46.888

21:46.972 --> 21:47.806
- OKAY, OKAY.

21:47.889 --> 21:50.392
SORRY WE MISTOOK YOU GUYS
FOR BOOGEYMEN.

21:50.475 --> 21:54.563
IT WAS AN HONEST MISTAKE.

21:54.646 --> 21:55.272
- SO WAIT.

21:55.355 --> 21:57.607
THERE AREN'T ANY BOOGEYMEN?

21:57.691 --> 21:58.442
- NOPE.

21:58.525 --> 22:00.902
TECHNICALLY,
I GUESS NO BOOGEYMEN

22:00.986 --> 22:03.405
MEANS NO MONSTER SQUAD
BADGE.

22:03.488 --> 22:04.865
WELL, BAD NEWS

22:04.948 --> 22:07.534
I'M BACK ON HIS CASE.

22:07.617 --> 22:08.410
SEE, BEN, I TOLD YOU.

22:08.493 --> 22:11.329
BOOGEYMEN

22:11.413 --> 22:13.832
[laughter]

22:13.915 --> 22:19.046
