00:19.185 --> 00:21.821
<i>- Uh, did you just get</i>
<i>a mysterious envelope</i>

00:21.888 --> 00:23.890
<i>and casually toss it aside</i>
<i>without even opening it?</i>

00:23.990 --> 00:26.159
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- Fuck, you're cool.</i>

00:26.226 --> 00:27.594
<i>- Okay, I already know</i>
<i>what's inside.</i>

00:27.694 --> 00:29.262
<i>It's my invite to</i>
<i>Kappa's pre-rush brunch</i>

00:29.362 --> 00:31.531
- <i>later this afternoon.</i>
<i>- How can you be sure?</i>

00:31.598 --> 00:35.035
<i>- Because as a future Kappa,</i>
<i>I know how Kappas think.</i>

00:35.101 --> 00:36.703
<i>And I also might've</i>
<i>heard two girls</i>

00:36.770 --> 00:39.039
<i>in my Lit seminar talking</i>
<i>about the envelope color.</i>

00:39.105 --> 00:40.507
<i>"Mykonos sky blue."</i>

00:40.573 --> 00:43.276
<i>- Interesting.</i>
<i>I think of it as more of</i>

00:43.376 --> 00:45.378
<i>a "Sonic the Hedgehog" blue.</i>

00:45.445 --> 00:48.281
<i>- Wait, Kappa invited you, too?</i>
<i>- Sure did.</i>

00:48.381 --> 00:50.784
<i>Got it last night. What?</i>
<i>Are you surprised?</i>

00:50.884 --> 00:53.753
<i>- Of course I'm surprised.</i>
<i>You wear sneakers with dresses.</i>

00:53.853 --> 00:55.789
<i>- Leighton, I'm gonna tell you</i>
<i>what I told Whitney.</i>

00:55.889 --> 00:57.957
<i>That sororities</i>
<i>have a long history</i>

00:58.058 --> 01:00.360
<i>of exclusionary behavior</i>
<i>that promote</i>

01:00.427 --> 01:02.262
<i>this kind of</i>
<i>woman-on-woman warfare.</i>

01:02.362 --> 01:04.764
<i>And that's why I will be</i>
<i>abstaining from Greek life.</i>

01:04.864 --> 01:07.200
<i>- Yeah, absolutely. Preach.</i>
<i>I'm totally on the same page.</i>

01:07.267 --> 01:09.035
<i>- Did you get an envelope?</i>
<i>- No, I did not.</i>

01:09.102 --> 01:09.969
<i>Me neither.</i>

01:17.644 --> 01:19.712
<i>- Hey, can I give you</i>
<i>some unsolicited feedback</i>

01:19.779 --> 01:21.247
<i>on what you're wearing?</i>

01:21.314 --> 01:23.116
<i>- Oh, my God, of course.</i>
<i>I love when people do that.</i>

01:23.216 --> 01:26.619
<i>- It's just Kappa is the most</i>
<i>exclusive sorority on campus.</i>

01:26.719 --> 01:29.155
<i>And this rush brunch</i>
<i>is your first opportunity</i>

01:29.255 --> 01:30.723
<i>to show them that you fit in.</i>

01:30.790 --> 01:32.492
<i>- Okay, so what's wrong</i>
<i>with what I'm wearing?</i>

01:32.592 --> 01:33.726
<i>It's jeans and sneakers.</i>

01:33.793 --> 01:35.161
<i>- And that is such</i>
<i>a cute outfit</i>

01:35.261 --> 01:36.930
<i>for, like, grocery shopping.</i>

01:36.996 --> 01:39.132
<i>I'm just saying there's still</i>
<i>time to run home and change.</i>

01:39.232 --> 01:40.900
<i>- Oh, my God.</i>
<i>Maybe you should change.</i>

01:40.967 --> 01:42.335
<i>I look good.</i>

01:42.435 --> 01:44.003
<i>You look like the perfume lady</i>
<i>at Bloomingdale's.</i>

01:44.104 --> 01:45.972
<i>- That is the meanest thing</i>
<i>you could've said to me.</i>

01:46.072 --> 01:48.308
<i>- I just--I think</i>
<i>you're overthinking it.</i>

01:48.408 --> 01:50.343
<i>The invite said</i>
<i>to dress casual.</i>

01:53.813 --> 01:56.516
<i>- This is what Kappa means</i>
<i>by casual.</i>

02:02.155 --> 02:04.491
<i>- Yeah, this is some "Get Out"</i>
<i>shit right here.</i>

02:12.432 --> 02:14.701
<i>- Hey, Mr. G,</i>
<i>I think you need to</i>

02:14.801 --> 02:18.705
<i>chugga chugga,</i>
<i>chugga chugga chill out.</i>

02:21.641 --> 02:25.311
<i>- That's so funny, right?</i>
<i>- I love that catchphrase.</i>

02:25.378 --> 02:27.680
<i>Chugga chugga chill out.</i>

02:27.780 --> 02:30.517
<i>- No, the sketch is about</i>
<i>how catchphrases are lame.</i>

02:30.617 --> 02:32.152
<i>No one would actually laugh</i>
<i>at someone saying</i>

02:32.218 --> 02:35.555
- <i>chugga chugga chill out.</i>

02:36.489 --> 02:39.392
<i>- Forget it. Look, this guy,</i>
<i>Danny Marawitz,</i>

02:39.492 --> 02:42.195
<i>he's a comedy legend.</i>
<i>He's also a "Catullan" alum,</i>

02:42.295 --> 02:44.063
<i>and he's going to be at</i>
<i>this big alumni dinner</i>

02:44.164 --> 02:45.064
<i>they're throwing tonight.</i>

02:45.165 --> 02:46.633
<i>I want to chat him up</i>

02:46.699 --> 02:48.401
<i>and convince him</i>
<i>to be my mentor.</i>

02:48.501 --> 02:50.970
<i>- Oh, Bela, I'm sure he'd love</i>
<i>to be your mentor.</i>

02:51.037 --> 02:52.372
<i>You're the funniest person</i>
<i>I know.</i>

02:52.472 --> 02:54.040
<i>It's like I live</i>
<i>with Bugs Bunny.</i>

02:54.140 --> 02:56.309
<i>- I know you mean that</i>
<i>as a compliment, so thank you.</i>

02:56.376 --> 02:57.911
<i>Hey, wait, actually,</i>
<i>do you want to</i>

02:58.011 --> 03:00.880
- <i>come with me as my plus one?</i>
<i>- Uh, yeah. I'd love to.</i>

03:00.980 --> 03:02.248
<i>Okay, cool.</i>

03:02.348 --> 03:03.816
<i>- So if people like</i>
<i>this Danny guy are going,</i>

03:03.883 --> 03:05.485
<i>it's probably going to be</i>
<i>pretty fancy, right?</i>

03:05.552 --> 03:09.389
<i>- Fancy as shit.</i>
<i>- Oh, so like pantyhose fancy.</i>

03:09.489 --> 03:11.991
<i>- Kimberly, nothing</i>
<i>is ever pantyhose fancy.</i>

03:12.058 --> 03:14.894
<i>- Okay, well, I only brought</i>
<i>one dress with me to college.</i>

03:14.994 --> 03:17.030
<i>- I'm sure it's fine.</i>
<i>Is it black?</i>

03:18.531 --> 03:19.933
<i>It's mustard.</i>

03:21.201 --> 03:22.602
<i>Maybe we just go shopping.</i>

03:25.371 --> 03:28.041
<i>- Okay, fresh rosemary sprig</i>
<i>in my drink.</i>

03:28.107 --> 03:29.442
<i>I can get on board with this.</i>

03:29.542 --> 03:30.777
<i>- See? Kappa's living up</i>
<i>to the hype.</i>

03:30.877 --> 03:32.745
<i>Oh, do you see</i>
<i>that blonde girl?</i>

03:32.845 --> 03:34.614
<i>- That's super creative.</i>

03:34.714 --> 03:36.416
<i>- There's like 15 blonde girls</i>
<i>over there.</i>

03:36.516 --> 03:38.218
<i>- Okay, first off,</i>
<i>half of them are bronde.</i>

03:38.284 --> 03:40.753
<i>No, I am talking about that</i>
<i>one right there, Quinn Cannon.</i>

03:40.853 --> 03:42.355
<i>She went to Spence.</i>
<i>She was like three years</i>

03:42.422 --> 03:44.857
<i>above me, and now</i>
<i>she's president of Kappa</i>

03:44.924 --> 03:47.260
<i>and queen of the entire</i>
<i>Essex social scene.</i>

03:47.360 --> 03:50.296
<i>Quinn Cannon is exactly who</i>
<i>I want to be in three years.</i>

03:50.396 --> 03:53.032
<i>Okay, I am going to go mingle.</i>
<i>Are you good on your own?</i>

03:53.099 --> 03:55.301
<i>- I most definitely am not.</i>
<i>- You'll be fine.</i>

03:55.401 --> 03:56.970
<i>All right,</i>
<i>I can text you details</i>

03:57.070 --> 03:58.705
<i>about who you're talking to,</i>
<i>if you need.</i>

03:58.771 --> 04:00.540
<i>I've done extensive research</i>
<i>on every single girl here.</i>

04:00.607 --> 04:01.941
<i>And if you need any help,</i>

04:02.041 --> 04:03.876
<i>just start talking</i>
<i>about celery juice.</i>

04:08.081 --> 04:10.917
<i>- Hey, you're Maura, right?</i>

04:11.451 --> 04:15.288
<i>- Yeah. You must be</i>
<i>Nico's sister, Leighton.</i>

04:15.388 --> 04:16.556
<i>How you liking Essex?</i>

04:16.623 --> 04:18.391
<i>- I've been busy</i>
<i>balancing schoolwork</i>

04:18.458 --> 04:20.226
<i>and extracurriculars</i>
<i>and finding ways</i>

04:20.293 --> 04:22.095
<i>to apply the knowledge</i>
<i>I gained last summer</i>

04:22.161 --> 04:24.897
<i>while interning for</i>
<i>Dahlia Lithwick at Slate.</i>

04:24.964 --> 04:26.599
<i>- Wow.</i>

04:26.666 --> 04:28.835
<i>I feel like I'm interviewing</i>
<i>you for a job.</i>

04:28.935 --> 04:32.238
- <i>Did you rehearse this?</i>
<i>- No.</i>

04:33.339 --> 04:35.174
<i>- Wait, your name</i>
<i>is Ashley, too?</i>

04:35.275 --> 04:36.476
<i>I just met an Ashley.</i>

04:36.576 --> 04:39.345
<i>- Yeah, but I spell it</i>
<i>A-S-H-L-E-E.</i>

04:39.445 --> 04:42.649
<i>I know.</i>
<i>What were my parents smoking?</i>

04:44.784 --> 04:46.319
<i>Allie VanLandingham.</i>

04:46.419 --> 04:48.855
<i>You were the senior</i>
<i>social chair at Choate, right?</i>

04:48.955 --> 04:51.090
<i>- Um, yeah.</i>
<i>How did you know that?</i>

04:51.157 --> 04:52.959
<i>- I mean there's only</i>
<i>three Choate Kappas.</i>

04:53.026 --> 04:55.695
<i>You, Madison, and Sheridan.</i>
<i>It's all on the website.</i>

04:55.795 --> 04:57.430
<i>Stalker much?</i>

04:57.497 --> 05:00.300
<i>- It--it's public information.</i>

05:00.366 --> 05:04.203
<i>- Yeah, but I spell it</i>
<i>A-S-H-L-E-I-G-H.</i>

05:04.304 --> 05:06.639
<i>- A-S-H-L-E-Y-E.</i>

05:06.706 --> 05:10.943
<i>- I spell it A-S-H-L-I-E.</i>

05:11.010 --> 05:12.679
<i>Do you like celery juice?</i>

05:12.779 --> 05:14.213
<i>- I have it</i>
<i>every single morning.</i>

05:14.314 --> 05:16.182
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

05:16.282 --> 05:19.118
<i>- Kappa girls are we</i>
<i>and everywhere we are.</i>

05:19.185 --> 05:22.121
<i>We wear the sacred letters,</i>
<i>K-B-R.</i>

05:22.188 --> 05:24.557
- <i>Go, Kappa Beta Rho!</i>

05:24.657 --> 05:27.060
<i>Oh, my God, there's such good</i>
<i>stuff in the Kappa hashtag.</i>

05:27.160 --> 05:28.494
<i>- Mm.</i>
<i>- Would it be crazy</i>

05:28.561 --> 05:31.397
- <i>if we made one together?</i>
<i>- Uh--</i>

05:31.497 --> 05:32.965
<i>Hey, sorry. I got to go.</i>

05:33.032 --> 05:34.967
<i>- Yeah, no, of course.</i>
<i>I'll see--I'll see you later.</i>

05:37.970 --> 05:39.906
<i>Your sneakers are so cool.</i>

05:40.006 --> 05:42.041
<i>- And you actually</i>
<i>play a varsity sport?</i>

05:42.141 --> 05:43.309
<i>That's so impressive.</i>

05:43.376 --> 05:44.744
<i>- Whitney,</i>
<i>what's your phone number?</i>

05:44.844 --> 05:46.879
<i>We want to add you</i>
<i>to our Kappa memes chain.</i>

05:46.979 --> 05:50.249
<i>- This has been so great,</i>
<i>but I have a team bus to catch.</i>

05:50.350 --> 05:53.019
<i>It was nice meeting you,</i>
<i>and I look forward to</i>

05:53.086 --> 05:55.488
<i>seeing you all on</i>
<i>"Selling Sunset" one day.</i>

05:55.555 --> 05:57.023
<i>- She's so fun.</i>

05:58.491 --> 05:59.892
<i>Oh, this one's so pretty.</i>

05:59.992 --> 06:02.729
<i>This looks like something</i>
<i>Shania Twain would wear.</i>

06:02.829 --> 06:04.764
<i>- Kimberly, no.</i>
<i>Please let me fix you.</i>

06:04.864 --> 06:06.499
- <i>I'm trying so hard.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

06:06.566 --> 06:08.935
<i>- So, have you met up</i>
<i>with hot-ass Nico</i>

06:09.035 --> 06:10.536
<i>for any more French lessons</i>
<i>yet?</i>

06:10.603 --> 06:12.839
<i>- No. Not since he bailed</i>
<i>on me last time.</i>

06:12.905 --> 06:14.207
<i>I'm not sure it'll be</i>
<i>an ongoing thing.</i>

06:14.273 --> 06:15.608
<i>But did you text him?</i>

06:15.708 --> 06:17.343
<i>- It's fine.</i>
<i>I don't want to bother him.</i>

06:18.411 --> 06:21.080
<i>- Wait, wait, wait, wait.</i>
<i>This is the dress.</i>

06:21.180 --> 06:22.548
<i>- Fire emoji.</i>

06:22.615 --> 06:24.617
<i>Head exploding emoji.</i>
<i>Tongue hanging out emoji.</i>

06:24.717 --> 06:27.019
- <i>You got to try this one out.</i>
<i>- This is beautiful.</i>

06:27.086 --> 06:29.922
<i>Oh, it's way too expensive.</i>

06:30.022 --> 06:31.557
<i>- Kimberly, if you don't wrap</i>
<i>your beautiful body</i>

06:31.624 --> 06:33.192
<i>in this dress, it will be</i>
<i>a slap in the face</i>

06:33.259 --> 06:35.294
- <i>of hot feminists everywhere.</i>
<i>- I can't afford this.</i>

06:35.395 --> 06:36.796
<i>This will use up way too much</i>

06:36.896 --> 06:38.531
<i>of my "for emergencies only"</i>
<i>credit card.</i>

06:38.598 --> 06:41.868
<i>- So, just leave the tags on</i>
<i>and return it tomorrow.</i>

06:52.145 --> 06:53.946
<i>Look at my big tits.</i>

06:57.250 --> 06:59.118
<i>- Hey, over here.</i>

06:59.218 --> 07:00.119
<i>Hey.</i>

07:03.589 --> 07:04.824
<i>Hey, my God.</i>

07:04.924 --> 07:06.659
<i>- I am so excited to get</i>
<i>out of town with you.</i>

07:06.759 --> 07:08.761
<i>- Me too.</i>
<i>I kind of love hotels.</i>

07:08.828 --> 07:10.430
<i>- Aw, that's so cute</i>
<i>but you're not going to</i>

07:10.496 --> 07:11.764
<i>like this one.</i>
<i>It's pretty gross.</i>

07:11.831 --> 07:13.332
<i>- Well, I'm sure</i>
<i>you'll like it more than</i>

07:13.433 --> 07:15.101
<i>crashing on your couch</i>
<i>for another night.</i>

07:15.168 --> 07:17.170
<i>It's got to be so weird</i>
<i>for you being around Michelle</i>

07:17.270 --> 07:18.638
<i>since you told her</i>
<i>you're leaving her.</i>

07:18.738 --> 07:20.173
<i>- Let's not think</i>
<i>about that right now.</i>

07:20.273 --> 07:21.941
<i>Let's just think about</i>
<i>all the hot hotel sex</i>

07:22.008 --> 07:24.310
- <i>we'll be having tonight.</i>
<i>- Mm. </i>

07:26.012 --> 07:28.514
<i>Okay, okay. Bus is ready.</i>
<i>We got to go.</i>

07:28.614 --> 07:30.450
<i>And hide your boner.</i>
<i>Damn, bro.</i>

07:31.184 --> 07:32.485
<i>- Wait, let me carry your bag</i>
<i>in front of it.</i>

07:32.585 --> 07:34.253
<i>- Just tuck it up</i>
<i>behind your belt.</i>

07:36.122 --> 07:37.490
<i>Come on.</i>

07:37.590 --> 07:41.260
<i>- All right, everybody.</i>
<i>Let's get on the bus.</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:49.035
<i>Leighton Murray.</i>

07:49.135 --> 07:51.370
<i>We're you leaving</i>
<i>without even saying hi to me?</i>

07:51.471 --> 07:52.805
<i>- Oh, yeah, sorry. I just--</i>

07:52.872 --> 07:55.007
<i>Well, I knew you were</i>
<i>really busy and I--</i>

07:55.107 --> 07:56.976
<i>I was really vibing</i>
<i>with the other girls. So--</i>

07:57.043 --> 07:58.544
<i>Yeah, I saw.</i>

07:58.644 --> 08:01.047
<i>Look, everyone here</i>
<i>is equally obsessed with Kappa.</i>

08:01.147 --> 08:02.348
<i>They're just better</i>
<i>at hiding it.</i>

08:02.448 --> 08:04.550
<i>Let's go inside</i>
<i>and get a drink.</i>

08:04.650 --> 08:07.887
<i>So, you might major in math?</i>
<i>Wow.</i>

08:07.987 --> 08:10.490
<i>- I know it's lame.</i>
<i>- No, it's refreshing.</i>

08:10.556 --> 08:12.792
<i>If I had to talk to another</i>
<i>fucking marketing major,</i>

08:12.859 --> 08:14.894
- <i>I was going to rip my ears off.</i>

08:14.994 --> 08:16.629
<i>Hey, do you Cory in Theta?</i>

08:16.696 --> 08:19.999
<i>- Uh, yeah.</i>
<i>Nico got Covid from him. Why?</i>

08:20.066 --> 08:21.801
<i>- Well, according to</i>
<i>my boyfriend,</i>

08:21.868 --> 08:23.903
<i>he has a huge crush on you.</i>

08:24.003 --> 08:27.473
<i>- Yes, I have heard that.</i>
<i>- Would you be into him?</i>

08:27.540 --> 08:29.809
<i>- Yeah, no, 100%.</i>
<i>He's--he's so cute.</i>

08:29.876 --> 08:31.143
<i>I knew it.</i>

08:31.210 --> 08:33.379
<i>I'm texting him right now</i>
<i>that you like him.</i>

08:43.990 --> 08:45.658
<i>- What's up?</i>

08:45.725 --> 08:47.260
<i>- Once we get to the hotel</i>
<i>you're gonna want to eat</i>

08:47.360 --> 08:48.694
<i>some crackers or something,</i>

08:48.761 --> 08:50.096
<i>'cause the team's</i>
<i>going out hard tonight.</i>

08:50.196 --> 08:51.697
<i>- But don't we</i>
<i>have a game tomorrow?</i>

08:51.764 --> 08:54.767
<i>- It's fine. The team</i>
<i>we're playing is awful.</i>

08:54.867 --> 08:56.335
<i>I'm telling you,</i>

08:56.402 --> 08:59.005
<i>tonight's the best team bonding</i>
<i>night of the year.</i>

08:59.071 --> 09:00.606
<i>You're gonna love it.</i>

09:01.407 --> 09:03.075
<i>- All right, ladies.</i>
<i>I need to speak with you.</i>

09:03.175 --> 09:05.444
- <i>So, all eyes on me.</i>
<i>- Way ahead of you, handsome.</i>

09:07.346 --> 09:08.781
<i>- Coach Woods and I know</i>
<i>that there was a lot</i>

09:08.881 --> 09:10.750
<i>of sneaking out</i>
<i>last year after curfew.</i>

09:10.850 --> 09:12.118
<i>And I just want to</i>
<i>make it clear that</i>

09:12.218 --> 09:13.586
<i>that's not gonna</i>
<i>happen again, okay?</i>

09:13.686 --> 09:15.454
<i>- I have a question.</i>
<i>- Okay, what is it?</i>

09:15.555 --> 09:18.457
<i>- How'd you get so fine?</i>

09:18.558 --> 09:19.759
<i>Okay, I get it.</i>

09:19.859 --> 09:21.294
<i>There's some weird jokes</i>
<i>among you girls</i>

09:21.394 --> 09:23.629
<i>that I'm, like,</i>
<i>attractive or whatever,</i>

09:23.729 --> 09:28.100
<i>but I am your coach,</i>
<i>and I deserve respect. Okay?</i>

09:28.200 --> 09:29.468
<i>All right, so when we</i>
<i>get to the hotel--</i>

09:29.569 --> 09:30.970
<i>- Take your shirt off!</i>

09:31.070 --> 09:32.638
<i>- No, I'm not going</i>
<i>to take my shirt off.</i>

09:32.738 --> 09:34.807
<i>And you can't</i>
<i>talk to me like that, okay?</i>

09:34.907 --> 09:37.810
<i>- Okay, Daddy.</i>
<i>- No, do not call me Daddy.</i>

09:37.910 --> 09:40.146
<i>I'm not your sexy Daddy.</i>

09:40.246 --> 09:42.882
<i>- Put me to bed, Daddy.</i>
<i>- Oh, come on.</i>

09:50.623 --> 09:52.158
<i>- Oh, man. So many "Catullan"</i>
<i>alums showed up.</i>

09:52.258 --> 09:54.093
<i>- Oh, my gosh there's</i>
<i>a helium balloon arch.</i>

09:54.160 --> 09:55.394
<i>I've always wanted</i>
<i>to walk under one.</i>

09:55.461 --> 09:57.129
<i>- Me too.</i>
<i>- Can you take a picture</i>

09:57.229 --> 09:58.831
- <i>of me with it?</i>
<i>- Yeah, sure.</i>

10:02.101 --> 10:04.170
<i>Yes, girl. Yes.</i>

10:04.270 --> 10:07.173
<i>So hot. Oh, my God,</i>
<i>you look so fucking hot.</i>

10:20.820 --> 10:23.356
<i>Hey, uh, so that's Ryan,</i>
<i>the nice editor.</i>

10:23.456 --> 10:25.358
<i>And that's Eric,</i>
<i>the mean editor.</i>

10:25.458 --> 10:27.293
<i>Oh, and that's Peter Cook,</i>
<i>class of '84.</i>

10:27.360 --> 10:28.928
<i>He wrote like all of</i>
<i>Greg's funny lines</i>

10:28.995 --> 10:30.596
<i>on "Dharma and Greg,"</i>
<i>just in case you talk to him</i>

10:30.663 --> 10:33.032
- <i>and that comes up.</i>
<i>- He's good at Greg, got it.</i>

10:33.132 --> 10:35.334
<i>Oh, hey, isn't that</i>
<i>the chugga chugga guy?</i>

10:35.434 --> 10:36.669
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:37.803 --> 10:39.872
<i>Hey, do you mind mingling with</i>
<i>the other plus ones for a bit?</i>

10:39.972 --> 10:41.607
<i>I'm going to go talk to him</i>

10:41.674 --> 10:43.275
<i>and I don't want you watching</i>
<i>as I make love to his ego.</i>

10:43.342 --> 10:44.677
<i>- Of course,</i>
<i>don't worry about me.</i>

10:44.777 --> 10:46.946
<i>I'm gonna hobnob</i>
<i>like it's my hob job.</i>

10:47.013 --> 10:49.849
<i>- Yeah, please don't.</i>
<i>- I won't try to be funny.</i>

10:49.949 --> 10:51.150
<i>I'll just, like,</i>
<i>talk to old ladies</i>

10:51.217 --> 10:52.718
<i>about recent "Jeopardy!"</i>
<i>episodes.</i>

10:52.818 --> 10:54.220
<i>Perfect. Okay.</i>

10:58.824 --> 11:00.526
<i>Oh, thank you.</i>

11:05.898 --> 11:09.135
<i>Lila, Canaan.</i>
<i>Hey, how are you guys?</i>

11:09.201 --> 11:11.971
<i>- Uh, Kimberly?</i>
<i>- How cool is this?</i>

11:12.038 --> 11:13.639
<i>Have you guys seen</i>
<i>the seafood tower?</i>

11:13.706 --> 11:18.411
- <i>It has three tiers.</i>
<i>- Wait, so you're a guest here?</i>

11:18.511 --> 11:21.080
- <i>And we're, like, serving you?</i>
<i>- Yeah, that's weird.</i>

11:21.180 --> 11:23.582
<i>- Oh, no, no.</i>
<i>I'm barely a guest.</i>

11:23.683 --> 11:25.017
<i>I'm my roommate's plus one,</i>

11:25.084 --> 11:26.652
<i>and I'm just here</i>
<i>on a technicality.</i>

11:27.520 --> 11:29.021
<i>Those look good.</i>

11:29.088 --> 11:32.224
<i>- Would you like</i>
<i>one of my coconut shrimp?</i>

11:33.926 --> 11:36.162
<i>- I'm good.</i>
<i>I just had something.</i>

11:36.228 --> 11:40.866
<i>- And do you want to put your</i>
<i>little stick on my trash tray?</i>

11:42.168 --> 11:45.271
<i>- No. I'm going to</i>
<i>hold on to it for a bit.</i>

11:45.371 --> 11:47.606
<i>I'm gonna take a lap.</i>

11:59.585 --> 12:02.421
<i>- Excuse me,</i>
<i>you're Danny Marawitz, right?</i>

12:02.521 --> 12:04.290
<i>- Mm-hmm.</i>
<i>- I'm Bela Malhotra.</i>

12:04.390 --> 12:06.058
<i>I'm a "Catullan" hopeful.</i>

12:06.125 --> 12:07.460
<i>I'm jealous.</i>

12:07.560 --> 12:08.928
<i>I'm just here</i>
<i>admiring pictures of myself</i>

12:09.028 --> 12:11.297
- <i>without a receding hairline.</i>

12:11.397 --> 12:12.631
<i>Well, if it's more hair</i>
<i>you want,</i>

12:12.732 --> 12:14.300
<i>I waxed my arms this morning.</i>

12:14.400 --> 12:16.102
<i>So there's basically</i>
<i>an Elvis wig in my garbage can.</i>

12:16.202 --> 12:17.403
<i>I'm sorry, that was gross.</i>

12:17.470 --> 12:18.571
<i>I'm just nervous</i>
<i>to talk to you.</i>

12:18.637 --> 12:20.606
<i>That's really funny.</i>

12:21.407 --> 12:24.577
- <i>What's your name again?</i>
<i>- Uh, Bela Malhotra.</i>

12:24.643 --> 12:26.112
<i>Well, good luck, Bela.</i>

12:26.912 --> 12:30.149
<i>Gentlemen, don't hit</i>
<i>me up for money please.</i>

12:40.760 --> 12:41.927
<i>Leighton?</i>

12:43.496 --> 12:45.464
<i>Did you buy a chair?</i>

12:45.564 --> 12:48.134
<i>- Yes. If I'm going to be here</i>
<i>for 100 hours,</i>

12:48.234 --> 12:51.003
<i>I'm not spending them on</i>
<i>a couch that's older than I am.</i>

12:51.103 --> 12:53.739
<i>- Oh, my God,</i>
<i>you know, you can't--</i>

12:53.806 --> 12:55.574
<i>- And before you jump</i>
<i>on my dick,</i>

12:55.641 --> 12:58.277
<i>my shift is over in ten minutes</i>
<i>and I've done a bunch of work.</i>

12:58.344 --> 13:00.513
<i>I restocked the tampons</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

13:00.613 --> 13:02.348
<i>I restocked the tampons</i>
<i>in the couch room.</i>

13:02.448 --> 13:04.350
<i>And I even gave</i>
<i>a girl a pamphlet</i>

13:04.450 --> 13:06.652
<i>on the prison</i>
<i>industrial complex.</i>

13:06.752 --> 13:08.921
<i>- Okay, um, if you want</i>
<i>to shave off some hours,</i>

13:08.988 --> 13:10.356
<i>I could really</i>
<i>use your help tonight.</i>

13:10.456 --> 13:13.325
<i>It's a panel on</i>
<i>the ABCs of the LGBTs.</i>

13:13.425 --> 13:16.195
- <i>You'll hate it.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I can't.</i>

13:16.295 --> 13:18.597
<i>I have a--I have a thing.</i>

13:18.664 --> 13:21.433
<i>- A date?</i>
<i>- Yes.</i>

13:21.500 --> 13:24.537
<i>- Ooh, this'll be so much fun.</i>
<i>Okay, let me guess your type.</i>

13:24.637 --> 13:27.540
<i>His name, Gareth.</i>
<i>His dad, the "Monopoly" man.</i>

13:27.640 --> 13:29.708
<i>And his hobbies,</i>
<i>they include sailing</i>

13:29.809 --> 13:31.544
<i>and benefiting from</i>
<i>generational wealth?</i>

13:31.644 --> 13:33.546
<i>- You forgot</i>
<i>belittling waiters, but yes.</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:34.980
<i>Otherwise, that's about right.</i>

13:35.047 --> 13:36.715
<i>- Well, that sounds like</i>
<i>my personal nightmare.</i>

13:36.816 --> 13:38.617
<i>- Mm.</i>
<i>- Condoms on your way out</i>

13:38.684 --> 13:40.619
- <i>if you want them.</i>
<i>- Yeah, no thank you.</i>

13:40.686 --> 13:42.288
<i>I do not hook up</i>
<i>on the first date.</i>

13:42.354 --> 13:44.456
<i>Whatever you say.</i>

13:50.496 --> 13:52.364
<i>- Hey.</i>
<i>- Hey.</i>

13:52.464 --> 13:54.333
<i>- I know I was</i>
<i>being weird before,</i>

13:54.400 --> 13:57.203
<i>but that was</i>
<i>because of something else.</i>

13:57.303 --> 14:00.139
- <i>And I'd love a Sprite, please.</i>
<i>- Okay, sure.</i>

14:00.206 --> 14:01.907
<i>One Sprite.</i>

14:04.343 --> 14:05.911
<i>What are you doing?</i>

14:06.011 --> 14:07.246
<i>- Oh, sorry.</i>
<i>Is that not enough?</i>

14:07.346 --> 14:08.514
<i>Fine, here.</i>

14:08.581 --> 14:09.982
<i>- What the hell</i>
<i>is wrong with you?</i>

14:10.049 --> 14:11.183
<i>It's a Sprite.</i>

14:11.250 --> 14:13.018
<i>- I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

14:13.085 --> 14:15.020
<i>- Don't worry about it.</i>
<i>Keep your money.</i>

14:15.087 --> 14:18.090
<i>No one else here</i>
<i>is tipping anyway, so...</i>

14:18.190 --> 14:19.859
<i>Hold on, I have an idea.</i>

14:21.193 --> 14:23.929
<i>Wow, a bartender</i>
<i>on full scholarship,</i>

14:24.029 --> 14:26.599
<i>and he makes a mean martini!</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:29.168
<i>Here is a 20.</i>

14:30.069 --> 14:31.770
<i>- What the hell?</i>
<i>- When people know</i>

14:31.871 --> 14:34.106
<i>we're on financial aid,</i>
<i>they tip more.</i>

14:34.206 --> 14:35.941
<i>- Okay, I get that</i>
<i>you're trying to help,</i>

14:36.041 --> 14:37.576
<i>but there's no way</i>
<i>that's going to work, so--</i>

14:37.676 --> 14:39.712
<i>- I'll take a martini.</i>
<i>- Hmm.</i>

14:42.014 --> 14:43.883
<i>Coming right up.</i>

14:43.949 --> 14:47.786
<i>- And Kappa's basically</i>
<i>Theta's sister sorority, so--</i>

14:47.887 --> 14:49.622
<i>You know, it would be great</i>
<i>if Nico and me--</i>

14:49.722 --> 14:50.723
<i>Yeah.</i>

14:51.557 --> 14:53.859
<i>I'm sorry, am I boring you?</i>

14:56.462 --> 14:59.365
<i>- Hey, I got to ask you,</i>
<i>what is this?</i>

14:59.431 --> 15:01.033
<i>What do you mean?</i>

15:01.100 --> 15:03.302
<i>- When I saw you this summer,</i>
<i>and then with your brother</i>

15:03.402 --> 15:06.305
<i>a couple weeks ago, you know,</i>
<i>you kind of seemed into me.</i>

15:06.405 --> 15:08.107
<i>And then,</i>
<i>I don't know, whenever</i>

15:08.207 --> 15:09.808
<i>I'd try to hit you up,</i>
<i>you ghost me.</i>

15:09.909 --> 15:12.211
<i>And then all of a sudden</i>
<i>you want to go to dinner?</i>

15:12.278 --> 15:14.280
<i>Something just kind of</i>
<i>seems off with you.</i>

15:14.380 --> 15:16.715
<i>- I--I just got to school</i>
<i>like a month ago.</i>

15:16.782 --> 15:18.817
<i>I'm sorry I don't hit you up</i>
<i>to dry hump me every night.</i>

15:18.918 --> 15:21.487
<i>- Whoa, whoa, whoa,</i>
<i>that's not what I meant at all.</i>

15:21.587 --> 15:24.623
<i>- No, I know. I'm sorry.</i>
<i>I just--I'm sorry.</i>

15:27.826 --> 15:30.663
<i>Look, Cory, I really like you.</i>

15:31.797 --> 15:34.566
<i>- Do you, Leighton?</i>
<i>'Cause sometimes I think--</i>

15:44.009 --> 15:45.477
<i>- Should we go back</i>
<i>to your place?</i>

15:45.577 --> 15:46.979
<i>I could talk</i>
<i>about Kappa some more.</i>

15:49.515 --> 15:51.183
<i>I would love that.</i>

15:51.283 --> 15:52.451
<i>- It was great chatting</i>
<i>with you, too.</i>

15:52.518 --> 15:53.519
<i>- You as well.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

15:53.619 --> 15:55.020
<i>My pleasure.</i>

15:55.120 --> 15:57.690
<i>- Dude, I am networking</i>
<i>my hot little ass off.</i>

15:59.325 --> 16:01.694
<i>- Excuse me? Can I</i>
<i>have your attention please?</i>

16:01.794 --> 16:03.295
<i>Oh, that's Danny.</i>

16:03.362 --> 16:05.798
<i>I am gonna get in his eyeline</i>
<i>and laugh really hard.</i>

16:07.132 --> 16:11.036
<i>- Uh, my time at "The Catullan"</i>
<i>changed my life.</i>

16:11.136 --> 16:13.706
<i>And I've spent the last 20</i>
<i>years trying to change it back.</i>

16:15.174 --> 16:17.142
<i>- But seriously,</i>
<i>there is no better place</i>

16:17.209 --> 16:18.377
<i>to launch a comedy career.</i>

16:18.477 --> 16:19.979
<i>With the skills</i>
<i>you'll learn here</i>

16:20.045 --> 16:21.513
<i>and the connections</i>
<i>you'll make,</i>

16:21.613 --> 16:23.716
<i>soon you'll be working</i>
<i>in writer's rooms with</i>

16:23.816 --> 16:26.485
<i>other funny guys and their</i>
<i>marginally funny girlfriends</i>

16:26.552 --> 16:29.021
<i>they've hired through nepotism.</i>

16:29.121 --> 16:31.056
<i>But jokes aside,</i>

16:31.156 --> 16:34.693
<i>I think it's great that there</i>
<i>are some female writers now.</i>

16:34.793 --> 16:36.562
<i>Like this girl right here.</i>

16:36.662 --> 16:38.230
<i>I had the chance</i>
<i>to chat with her earlier,</i>

16:38.330 --> 16:40.399
<i>and I honestly think</i>
<i>that people like her</i>

16:40.499 --> 16:43.235
<i>are the future of comedy.</i>

16:43.335 --> 16:45.404
<i>A young Indian woman?</i>

16:45.504 --> 16:46.739
<i>Soon she'll be</i>
<i>the only one of us</i>

16:46.839 --> 16:48.240
<i>who can sell a television show.</i>

16:48.340 --> 16:50.709
<i>Let me guess,</i>
<i>about a quirky ethnic woman</i>

16:50.809 --> 16:53.045
<i>trying to balance</i>
<i>her love life and her career.</i>

16:53.145 --> 16:54.747
<i>Yeah, that's compelling.</i>

17:00.486 --> 17:02.488
<i>- Hey, hey.</i>
<i>- You want? Oh, shoot.</i>

17:04.189 --> 17:06.091
<i>- Wait, wait you need one.</i>
<i>You need one.</i>

17:06.191 --> 17:07.026
<i>Go, go.</i>

17:10.329 --> 17:11.930
<i>- Okay, okay,</i>
<i>where are we going?</i>

17:12.031 --> 17:13.265
<i>- A mini-golf course</i>
<i>that shares</i>

17:13.365 --> 17:15.100
<i>a parking lot with</i>
<i>a McDonald's.</i>

17:15.200 --> 17:17.736
<i>- God damn,</i>
<i>that sounds amazing.</i>

17:22.708 --> 17:25.277
<i>Okay. Thank you.</i>

17:33.085 --> 17:35.054
<i>- Hump that dino.</i>
<i>- Yo, babe.</i>

17:35.120 --> 17:36.588
- <i>Yeah, baby.</i>
<i>- Yeah, I got it.</i>

17:36.688 --> 17:40.125
<i>- This is 1000% going</i>
<i>on my Tinder profile.</i>

17:40.225 --> 17:41.460
<i>Okay, look.</i>

17:41.560 --> 17:42.694
<i>- Okay, it's lit.</i>
<i>- Uh-huh.</i>

17:42.761 --> 17:44.296
<i>- Okay, all right.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

17:44.396 --> 17:47.132
<i>- What was that?</i>
<i>- What? Nothing.</i>

17:48.534 --> 17:49.868
<i>Oh, shit.</i>

17:51.437 --> 17:53.539
<i>You're hooking up</i>
<i>with Coach Dalton.</i>

17:58.377 --> 18:00.979
<i>- He may have hilarious</i>
<i>catchphrases,</i>

18:01.080 --> 18:02.548
<i>but that guy was such a jerk.</i>

18:02.614 --> 18:04.883
<i>I really hated</i>
<i>everything he said.</i>

18:05.751 --> 18:07.719
<i>- Hey, thanks</i>
<i>for being a good sport.</i>

18:07.786 --> 18:09.321
<i>Anything for the laugh, right?</i>

18:10.456 --> 18:12.324
<i>You're an asshole.</i>

18:12.424 --> 18:15.594
<i>Easy, honey. Don't get upset.</i>

18:15.661 --> 18:17.129
<i>I promise you,</i>
<i>it's not a good look.</i>

18:17.229 --> 18:18.430
<i>I used to look up to you,</i>

18:18.497 --> 18:19.932
<i>but now</i>
<i>I don't even remember why.</i>

18:19.998 --> 18:21.834
<i>You haven't worked in,</i>
<i>like, ten years</i>

18:21.934 --> 18:23.335
<i>and you know why?</i>

18:23.435 --> 18:24.837
<i>Because you're not funny</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

18:24.937 --> 18:27.406
<i>You're like toxic podcast</i>
<i>funny, at best.</i>

18:27.473 --> 18:30.576
<i>So, chugga chugga,</i>
<i>chugga chugga eat shit.</i>

18:33.112 --> 18:34.746
<i>- You can forget about</i>
<i>my donation check.</i>

18:34.813 --> 18:38.016
<i>- Wait, w--what are you--wait.</i>
<i>Hey, Danny, wait.</i>

18:38.117 --> 18:40.519
<i>I think it's crazy you</i>
<i>haven't worked in ten years.</i>

18:40.619 --> 18:43.655
<i>- You don't need</i>
<i>his money anyway, right?</i>

18:48.327 --> 18:50.262
<i>- I have so many questions.</i>

18:50.329 --> 18:51.530
<i>When did this start?</i>

18:51.630 --> 18:53.031
<i>Is he as good at sex</i>
<i>as he looks?</i>

18:53.132 --> 18:54.766
<i>And bitch are you crazy?</i>
<i>Answer the sex one first.</i>

18:54.833 --> 18:56.502
<i>- I know. I know it's insane.</i>
<i>Okay?</i>

18:56.602 --> 19:00.038
<i>But I can't help myself.</i>
<i>I--I think I, like, love him.</i>

19:00.139 --> 19:01.807
<i>- You love him?</i>
<i>- Willow.</i>

19:01.874 --> 19:03.876
<i>Please keep your voice down.</i>
<i>Okay, no one can find out.</i>

19:03.976 --> 19:05.777
<i>- This whole team</i>
<i>is full of secrets,</i>

19:05.844 --> 19:07.045
<i>and I never share them.</i>

19:07.146 --> 19:08.847
<i>Last spring,</i>
<i>Jena ran over a dog.</i>

19:08.947 --> 19:11.150
<i>- You just shared one.</i>
<i>Willow, please.</i>

19:11.216 --> 19:12.818
<i>Okay, this could</i>
<i>ruin Dalton's career.</i>

19:12.885 --> 19:14.153
<i>And with my mom</i>
<i>being a senator,</i>

19:14.219 --> 19:15.487
<i>it would be</i>
<i>this whole big thing.</i>

19:15.554 --> 19:16.889
<i>Okay, you really</i>
<i>can't say anything.</i>

19:16.989 --> 19:19.224
<i>- Say anything about what?</i>
<i>- Hey, Jena.</i>

19:19.324 --> 19:21.493
<i>Uh, Willow and I</i>
<i>are actually in the middle</i>

19:21.560 --> 19:23.362
<i>of an important,</i>
<i>private conversation.</i>

19:23.462 --> 19:25.164
<i>- About what?</i>
<i>- News and current events.</i>

19:25.230 --> 19:26.832
<i>What the fuck do you care?</i>
<i>Go ahead, go.</i>

19:26.899 --> 19:28.333
<i>Okay, chill. Geez.</i>

19:29.902 --> 19:31.336
<i>Can we just get out of here?</i>

19:31.403 --> 19:33.005
<i>- Can we stop at the McDonalds</i>
<i>on the way home?</i>

19:33.071 --> 19:34.206
<i>- Yes.</i>
<i>- All right.</i>

19:36.508 --> 19:38.744
<i>- Well, they're definitely</i>
<i>fucking.</i>

19:51.890 --> 19:53.425
<i>You down?</i>

19:53.525 --> 19:54.893
<i>Yeah, I'm fine.</i>

20:23.388 --> 20:25.457
<i>- Bela, I--I really think</i>
<i>you overreacted.</i>

20:25.557 --> 20:26.792
<i>Danny can't be sexist.</i>

20:26.892 --> 20:28.727
<i>He only hires</i>
<i>female assistants.</i>

20:28.794 --> 20:30.696
<i>- She's right.</i>
<i>I told him my name,</i>

20:30.762 --> 20:32.564
<i>and he said</i>
<i>he'd just call me Ali Wong.</i>

20:32.631 --> 20:33.966
<i>- He's rude,</i>

20:34.066 --> 20:36.401
<i>and I'm glad</i>
<i>Bela said something.</i>

20:38.804 --> 20:39.905
<i>It'll be okay.</i>

20:41.707 --> 20:44.109
<i>- Maybe we should just go.</i>
<i>- I'll go get our coats.</i>

20:46.044 --> 20:48.747
<i>- Bela, right?</i>
<i>The roast master herself.</i>

20:49.581 --> 20:51.149
<i>- Yeah, now might not</i>
<i>be the time.</i>

20:51.250 --> 20:53.318
<i>- I overheard</i>
<i>what you said to Danny.</i>

20:53.418 --> 20:55.954
<i>And I want to thank you.</i>

20:56.955 --> 20:59.725
<i>Danny Marawitz is and always</i>
<i>has been a total shit.</i>

20:59.791 --> 21:01.793
<i>He and I were tapped</i>
<i>in the same year,</i>

21:01.893 --> 21:03.996
<i>and his favorite "joke"</i>
<i>was to call me gay.</i>

21:04.096 --> 21:07.165
<i>And I am gay, so--that sucked.</i>

21:07.266 --> 21:08.667
<i>He made "The Catullan"</i>
<i>a living hell</i>

21:08.767 --> 21:10.469
<i>for everyone on staff</i>
<i>for four years.</i>

21:10.569 --> 21:13.171
<i>But until tonight, I've never</i>
<i>seen anyone go back at him.</i>

21:14.172 --> 21:17.342
<i>I'd be happy to write a check</i>
<i>to replace his donation.</i>

21:17.442 --> 21:19.177
<i>- He said he was donating</i>
<i>20 grand.</i>

21:19.278 --> 21:22.180
<i>- I'd be happy to write a check</i>
<i>to replace half his donation.</i>

21:22.281 --> 21:24.349
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

21:27.686 --> 21:28.854
<i>Thanks.</i>

21:30.289 --> 21:31.823
<i>Hey, Kimberly.</i>

21:31.923 --> 21:35.193
<i>We wanted to give this to you.</i>
<i>It's all of your fake tips</i>

21:35.294 --> 21:36.695
<i>and then a cut of</i>
<i>everything else that we made.</i>

21:36.795 --> 21:38.430
<i>What? No. I can't take that.</i>

21:38.497 --> 21:41.600
<i>- We thought it was only fair</i>
<i>and he was reluctant at first,</i>

21:41.667 --> 21:43.268
<i>but I convinced him.</i>

21:43.335 --> 21:44.836
<i>- It was definitely</i>
<i>the other way around.</i>

21:44.936 --> 21:47.339
<i>- That's a lie.</i>
<i>An impossible to prove lie.</i>

21:47.439 --> 21:49.708
<i>- It's really nice</i>
<i>of you guys but--</i>

21:49.808 --> 21:51.276
<i>Oh, my God, just take it.</i>

21:51.343 --> 21:53.178
<i>It's like a real small</i>
<i>percentage of what we made.</i>

21:53.278 --> 21:54.713
<i>- Very small.</i>
<i>- We wouldn't have made</i>

21:54.813 --> 21:56.682
- <i>anything without your help.</i>
<i>- Thanks.</i>

21:56.782 --> 21:58.183
<i>You're welcome.</i>

21:58.283 --> 21:59.718
<i>- Oh, yes. Of course.</i>

21:59.818 --> 22:02.621
<i>- Oh, no, no.</i>
<i>That's not how this works.</i>

22:02.688 --> 22:04.122
<i>Help does not tip help.</i>

22:07.025 --> 22:09.561
<i>- Willow, you swear</i>
<i>you won't tell anyone?</i>

22:09.661 --> 22:12.297
<i>- Whitney, I know this may be</i>
<i>tough for you to believe,</i>

22:12.364 --> 22:14.066
<i>given all the men's hoodies</i>
<i>I wear,</i>

22:14.166 --> 22:15.901
<i>but I was closeted once.</i>
<i>I can keep a secret.</i>

22:16.001 --> 22:17.402
<i>Okay.</i>

22:17.502 --> 22:20.539
<i>- Now, go have gross, straight</i>
<i>sex with our coach.</i>

22:20.639 --> 22:23.842
<i>And do not wake me up</i>
<i>when you get back.</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:27.145
<i>- Okay. Hey.</i>
<i>- Hmm?</i>

22:27.212 --> 22:28.914
<i>- You're a good friend.</i>

22:30.716 --> 22:32.351
<i>Drink water.</i>

23:00.178 --> 23:01.513
<i>Hey.</i>

23:01.580 --> 23:04.082
<i>- I'm so sorry I'm late.</i>
<i>I feel terrible.</i>

23:04.182 --> 23:06.551
<i>We had plans and</i>
<i>I just lost track of time.</i>

23:06.618 --> 23:08.253
<i>It's all good.</i>

23:08.353 --> 23:10.622
<i>Tonight I get to fall asleep</i>
<i>next to you for the first time.</i>

23:14.559 --> 23:16.294
<i>Well don't fall asleep, yet.</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:39.604
<i>Go to bed.</i>
