WEBVTT

00:31.297 --> 00:32.999
...years ago.

00:36.302 --> 00:37.364
That's it!

00:44.551 --> 00:46.653
You understand!

00:46.753 --> 00:48.755
I know you do!

00:54.881 --> 00:56.883
Ohh!

02:13.880 --> 02:15.882
Hey, kiddo.

02:18.805 --> 02:21.828
I feel as if
I've stepped into a,

02:21.928 --> 02:23.270
a time machine.

02:25.131 --> 02:26.713
Oh, my God,

02:26.813 --> 02:28.275
is that a Steenbeck?

02:28.375 --> 02:30.917
The perks
of being a drop-out.

02:31.017 --> 02:34.361
I can just do what I do, my way.

02:34.461 --> 02:36.463
It's nice.

02:37.183 --> 02:39.045
I don't think in all these years

02:39.145 --> 02:41.147
that I've told you, but...

02:42.148 --> 02:43.330
I'm sorry.

02:43.430 --> 02:46.072
No, Laura, it was my fault,

02:47.033 --> 02:49.035
not yours.

02:49.636 --> 02:51.298
After what happened,

02:51.398 --> 02:53.580
I needed to leave the company.

02:53.680 --> 02:57.063
Besides, it was
almost 30 years ago.

02:57.163 --> 02:59.686
I kept up with your work,
you know.

03:00.687 --> 03:03.110
The superheroes in space

03:03.210 --> 03:06.353
with the fourth
dimensional explosions.

03:06.453 --> 03:08.475
New tools.

03:08.575 --> 03:11.838
That's all that is. CGI.

03:11.938 --> 03:13.400
I think you would have loved it

03:13.500 --> 03:14.761
if you gave it a shot.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.625
I needed something real
to hold on to.

03:22.309 --> 03:24.591
Uh, the service was nice.

03:34.761 --> 03:37.884
Laura, you're here
for a reason, aren't you?

03:41.368 --> 03:43.450
These were always my favourite.

03:45.252 --> 03:48.435
I don't know how you do it,

03:48.535 --> 03:52.459
capture a soul
with latex and paint.

03:55.862 --> 03:58.485
Do you think it's possible

03:58.585 --> 04:01.288
to be forgiven by the dead?

04:01.388 --> 04:05.052
No. I tried for 30 years.

04:05.152 --> 04:08.195
The best we can do
is forgive ourselves.

04:16.363 --> 04:18.905
Max and I were getting divorced.

04:19.005 --> 04:23.150
Well, I haven't spoken
to him for years. I'm sorry.

04:23.250 --> 04:25.032
We were still partners at work.

04:25.132 --> 04:26.914
We kept the facade,

04:27.014 --> 04:28.916
but at home,

04:29.016 --> 04:31.118
things had gotten really bad.

04:31.218 --> 04:33.720
On the day he died,
I asked him to come and see me

04:33.820 --> 04:36.363
to talk through
some of the final things
in the divorce agreement.

04:36.463 --> 04:39.166
One thing led to another,
and I...

04:39.266 --> 04:41.128
I started a fight.

04:41.228 --> 04:42.569
It was the same old fight.

04:42.669 --> 04:44.671
Sing it again.

04:44.992 --> 04:47.134
But this time,

04:47.234 --> 04:48.535
something broke.

04:48.635 --> 04:51.138
He ran outside from the house,

04:51.238 --> 04:53.700
and he turned
and looked at me

04:53.800 --> 04:55.802
one last time...

05:00.527 --> 05:02.549
and jumped.

05:02.649 --> 05:04.671
Oh, Jesus.

05:04.771 --> 05:07.074
Before he went over the edge,

05:07.174 --> 05:09.176
his eyes...

05:11.858 --> 05:13.860
Arthur...

05:14.901 --> 05:17.324
I came here to hire you.

05:17.424 --> 05:19.847
No. No.

05:19.947 --> 05:21.608
I came here to beg you.

05:21.708 --> 05:26.013
I need you to make me
one of your maquettes of Max.

05:26.113 --> 05:28.015
I need to look into his eyes

05:28.115 --> 05:30.617
and beg the forgiveness
of a ghost.

05:30.717 --> 05:33.100
And maybe he'll forgive me
and maybe he won't.

05:33.200 --> 05:36.623
Maybe I'm damned
to follow him over that cliff.

05:36.723 --> 05:38.725
But I need to know.

05:39.526 --> 05:40.908
That's why I'm here.

05:47.975 --> 05:50.557
You can say it.

05:50.657 --> 05:53.440
I've lost it.
I, I must sound nuts.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.963
Grief is a strange creature.

05:56.063 --> 05:57.965
I just can't let that
be the last time

05:58.065 --> 05:59.166
that I see his face.

05:59.266 --> 06:00.327
I need to apologise.

06:00.427 --> 06:02.369
I need to beg
his forgiveness.

06:02.469 --> 06:04.892
And you're the only one
who can bring him back for me.

06:04.992 --> 06:07.014
You are the only one
who can understand.

06:07.114 --> 06:09.176
I know you do.

06:09.276 --> 06:11.358
You would do the same thing.

07:04.051 --> 07:06.053
Max.

07:07.975 --> 07:09.977
Oh, Max, I'm...

07:11.178 --> 07:13.180
I'm so sorry.

07:22.790 --> 07:25.012
My God, Laura!

07:25.112 --> 07:27.214
My God!

07:27.314 --> 07:30.397
How could you?
It was 40 years ago.

07:31.759 --> 07:34.702
If I could undo it, I would.

07:34.802 --> 07:37.084
But it's done.

07:38.085 --> 07:40.788
We're here and now.

07:40.888 --> 07:42.890
Forget that you saw it.

07:44.011 --> 07:45.232
And let it go.

07:45.332 --> 07:46.473
Laura, I can't.

07:46.573 --> 07:49.076
I can't lie about this.

07:49.176 --> 07:51.859
I came here to tell you
that I'm going to take
the footage to the police.

07:54.982 --> 07:56.163
Please.
No!

07:56.263 --> 07:58.265
No, there's no other way.

07:58.906 --> 08:00.367
I've made up my mind.

08:06.513 --> 08:08.375
Okay.

08:08.475 --> 08:10.477
Just...

08:13.240 --> 08:15.242
Just hold on.

08:27.815 --> 08:29.817
Thank you.

08:33.901 --> 08:37.445
Has, has anyone else seen
the footage?

08:37.545 --> 08:40.047
No one else but me.

08:40.147 --> 08:42.950
I wanted to tell you first
before I went to the police.

08:44.151 --> 08:45.573
I owe you that.

08:45.673 --> 08:47.014
Thank you.

08:47.114 --> 08:50.377
I think you should tell Arthur. Tonight.

08:50.477 --> 08:53.381
I think he would want
to hear it from you.

08:53.481 --> 08:55.483
Before all this comes out.

08:56.484 --> 08:59.527
Max, you're right.

09:01.569 --> 09:03.270
All of this is right.

09:03.370 --> 09:06.594
And now that
I have accepted it,

09:06.694 --> 09:10.438
it's like a weight has been
lifted from my shoulders.

09:10.538 --> 09:13.000
Thank you for being strong
for both of us.

09:18.506 --> 09:20.508
I, I can't feel my hands.

09:24.672 --> 09:26.093
What did you do?

09:26.193 --> 09:27.655
It's already in your system.

09:27.755 --> 09:30.137
In, in a few minutes,
your heart will start to slow.

09:30.237 --> 09:34.101
It will be painless.
Just like falling asleep.

09:37.044 --> 09:39.307
Max, there's nothing
that you can do.

09:39.407 --> 09:41.409
Just let it happen.

09:43.210 --> 09:44.672
You're insane.

09:44.772 --> 09:47.254
The footage is locked
on my drive, Laura.

09:49.216 --> 09:51.038
You can't get to it.

09:51.138 --> 09:54.041
I have all of your passwords.

09:54.141 --> 09:58.205
I'll delete the file
and burn the original film.

09:58.305 --> 10:00.648
This is everything, Max.

10:00.748 --> 10:02.730
This is everything that is mine.

10:02.830 --> 10:05.513
And I, I can't let you take it.

10:10.237 --> 10:12.460
Max! Max!

10:12.560 --> 10:14.702
You understand!

10:14.802 --> 10:16.804
I know you do!

10:20.328 --> 10:22.330
You would do the same thing.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.293
Look into my eyes, Laura.

10:26.494 --> 10:28.496
Remember this.

10:31.258 --> 10:33.080
Ohh!

10:33.180 --> 10:34.482
Oh, my God.

11:18.906 --> 11:21.269
Oh, shit.

11:40.848 --> 11:42.850
Thank you.

11:50.258 --> 11:52.600
(over phone) <i>LAM Archives.</i>

11:52.700 --> 11:54.001
Raoul.

11:54.101 --> 11:55.843
How you doing? It's Laura.

11:55.943 --> 11:58.486
I need you to pull
some film for me
and bring it to the house.

11:58.586 --> 12:01.489
It's from the <i>Dragonfish</i>
behind-the-scenes shoot

12:01.589 --> 12:02.970
in the '80s.

12:03.070 --> 12:07.995
It's reel number 1-6-6-3-2-4-6.

12:27.095 --> 12:28.756
Barber 1: How's the family?
Man 1: Doing great.

12:28.856 --> 12:31.039
Johnny's getting
honour roll this semester.

12:31.139 --> 12:32.720
How's the shop?
Never better.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.162
Man 1: That's fantastic.

12:34.262 --> 12:35.883
How's the new job?
Oh, terrific.

12:35.983 --> 12:38.206
I like my coworkers.
It pays the bills.

12:38.306 --> 12:39.968
Barber 2: That's wonderful.
Man 2: Sure.

12:40.068 --> 12:43.211
It's a bit of an adjustment,
but I'm loving married life.

12:43.311 --> 12:44.652
Barber 3: How's it look?
Man 3: Great.

12:44.752 --> 12:46.494
Best cut ever.

12:46.594 --> 12:48.856
Oh, my God,
the mountainous volume,

12:48.956 --> 12:51.459
the sheer metric tonnage
of bullshit in this place,

12:51.559 --> 12:53.861
every word, I swear to God.

12:53.961 --> 12:56.224
I think maybe I'm getting
more sensitive or something.

12:56.324 --> 12:58.766
I'm developing an eye twitch.
Can you see that?

13:00.408 --> 13:02.110
Yeah.
Yeah.

13:02.210 --> 13:03.231
How do you handle it?

13:03.331 --> 13:05.553
It's a barbershop.

13:05.653 --> 13:07.275
Hey, I need you to deliver this

13:07.375 --> 13:09.197

13:09.297 --> 13:11.319

13:11.419 --> 13:12.560
Extra little for you.

13:12.660 --> 13:14.963
Ah!

13:15.063 --> 13:16.564
What's in it?
What do you think?

13:16.664 --> 13:17.565
Right.

13:59.307 --> 14:01.789
Bag of human hair. Hello.

14:03.191 --> 14:05.193
Jesus.

14:05.713 --> 14:07.755
Hey.
Oh.

14:08.596 --> 14:09.737
Oh, hi.

14:09.837 --> 14:12.941
I got your bag of hair
from the, uh,

14:13.041 --> 14:14.462
the barbershop.

14:14.562 --> 14:16.564
Ah, right.

14:17.445 --> 14:19.147
Right.

14:19.247 --> 14:21.249
Right, right. Uh...

14:22.210 --> 14:24.192
Hair.

14:24.292 --> 14:26.394
You're welcome.

14:26.494 --> 14:29.938
Uh... so, uh...

14:31.419 --> 14:32.841
no need for an explanation.

14:32.941 --> 14:35.283
I, uh...

14:35.383 --> 14:39.007
I'm Charlie, by the way.
Uh, Charlie Cale.

14:39.107 --> 14:41.449
Arthur.
Hey, Arthur.

14:41.549 --> 14:45.333
So, uh, just leave it, uh...

14:45.433 --> 14:46.574
leave it here?

14:46.674 --> 14:48.676
Perfect.

14:49.958 --> 14:51.960
Too easy.

14:56.124 --> 14:58.146
Hey, man, uh, listen,
I'm gettin' the vibe

14:58.246 --> 14:59.828
you want to be left alone,
and I, I really,

14:59.928 --> 15:03.031
I respect that, so I apologise
in advance, but...

15:03.131 --> 15:05.714
well, with the hair
and the, uh...

15:05.814 --> 15:07.996
the monster in the window,

15:08.096 --> 15:09.317
consider my interest piqued.

15:09.417 --> 15:12.080
So, uh, what do you do?

15:12.180 --> 15:15.523
Charlie, usually,
I, I like to talk

15:15.623 --> 15:18.166
about what I do.

15:18.266 --> 15:22.971
But today, I just buried
an old friend.

15:23.071 --> 15:25.573
So, right now, all I feel like

15:25.673 --> 15:27.996
is getting shitfaced.

15:30.078 --> 15:32.080
My eye's not twitching.

15:32.841 --> 15:34.783
Uh...

15:34.883 --> 15:36.665
which is to say,
that's the first honest thing

15:36.765 --> 15:38.346
I've heard all week.

15:38.446 --> 15:40.388
Uh, and I'm sorry for your loss.

15:40.488 --> 15:42.070
Hey, listen, I,

15:42.170 --> 15:43.872
I didn't know what kind
of a griever you are,

15:43.972 --> 15:48.557
but if having
some company helps,

15:48.657 --> 15:52.160
I, uh, I'm in no rush
to get back to work.

15:52.260 --> 15:55.443
Sit, leave,
doesn't matter to me.

15:55.543 --> 15:58.687
That blessed honesty.

15:58.787 --> 16:01.549
Gotta say,
it's manna from heaven.

16:03.471 --> 16:05.473
Ah.

16:10.438 --> 16:12.440
Mm.

16:12.841 --> 16:14.222
That one stung, Arthur.

16:20.568 --> 16:22.991
So, when I blew smoke out,

16:23.091 --> 16:24.633
it was supposed
to go out the trunk,

16:24.733 --> 16:26.475
it didn't, it went out the ass.

16:26.575 --> 16:30.318
And it covers
the first three rows of people.

16:30.418 --> 16:31.760
They split.

16:33.101 --> 16:35.303
Everybody else gets out.

16:40.629 --> 16:41.690
Ahh.

16:41.790 --> 16:43.011
Hello.

16:43.111 --> 16:45.654
Art. Jesus.

16:45.754 --> 16:49.538
You are a cool, cool dude, man.

16:49.638 --> 16:52.180
God, this is a major relief,

16:52.280 --> 16:55.183
because with the hair
and everything,

16:55.283 --> 16:57.466
I thought maybe you were
potentially some kind

16:57.566 --> 16:58.827
of a serial killer.

16:58.927 --> 17:00.909
Well, if I was a serial killer,

17:01.009 --> 17:02.511
I wouldn't need hair.

17:02.611 --> 17:04.152
I'd already have hair.

17:04.252 --> 17:08.397
Well, you could be
a serial killer of the bald.

17:08.497 --> 17:09.838
Aha.

17:09.938 --> 17:11.600
Should I call you a cab?

17:11.700 --> 17:13.402
I got the Cuda. I got the car.

17:13.502 --> 17:15.003
So I'm all set.

17:15.103 --> 17:16.565
You're not going to drive.

17:16.665 --> 17:18.527
No, no. To sleep in.

17:18.627 --> 17:20.849
You know, there's a cot
right up there.

17:20.949 --> 17:22.931
You could crash here tonight.

17:23.031 --> 17:24.973
Oh, that's not scary at all.

17:25.073 --> 17:27.075
That's great.

17:28.356 --> 17:29.297
Yeah.

17:29.397 --> 17:30.739
Jesus.

17:30.839 --> 17:33.862
Monsters, monsters, monsters.

17:33.962 --> 17:35.143
Wow, wow.

17:35.243 --> 17:37.225
Holy cow.

17:37.325 --> 17:41.670
All this comes
from inside your head?

17:41.770 --> 17:46.114
I mean, it must be
a horror show in there.

17:46.214 --> 17:48.717
Hell, you got no idea, kid.

17:48.817 --> 17:50.519
Monsters.

17:50.619 --> 17:52.741
Screams from the void.

17:54.102 --> 17:55.283
Void screams?

17:55.383 --> 17:57.165
Yeah.
Very heavy.

17:57.265 --> 17:59.328
All right, so I'm standing

17:59.428 --> 18:01.890
and I'm looking
and I'm thinking.

18:01.990 --> 18:04.453
And so, feel free
to say it's a no-go,

18:04.553 --> 18:06.975
but do you need an assistant?

18:07.075 --> 18:09.338
Now, before you answer that,
I should warn you

18:09.438 --> 18:10.859
that I only accept cash,

18:10.959 --> 18:13.181
and you can feel free
to underpay me.

18:13.281 --> 18:15.063
Well...

18:15.163 --> 18:17.145
why not?

18:17.245 --> 18:19.428
Welcome to the House of Horrors,

18:19.528 --> 18:21.530
Charlie Cale.

18:24.893 --> 18:27.035
All right.

18:37.506 --> 18:39.448
Mamma mia.

18:39.548 --> 18:41.169
Don't touch those.

18:41.269 --> 18:42.731
Oh. Yeah, sorry, I just,

18:42.831 --> 18:45.254
I see you working on it
all the time, I got curious.

18:45.354 --> 18:48.377
So, uh, what's it, uh,
what's it going to be?

18:48.477 --> 18:51.260
I'm calling it
<i>The Orpheus Syndrome.</i>

18:51.360 --> 18:52.861
Oh, yeah? What's it about?

18:52.961 --> 18:54.963
It's a non-narrative.

18:57.886 --> 19:00.309
Oh, uh, you want
some of this jelly toast?

19:00.409 --> 19:02.351
It's freaking delicious.
You bought jelly?

19:02.451 --> 19:05.554
Mm, no.
It's, uh, you had some
of it in your fridge.

19:05.654 --> 19:07.115
You know, that's fake blood.

19:07.215 --> 19:09.077
Do you know how expensive
that stuff is?

19:09.177 --> 19:11.380
That costs more than real blood.

19:13.422 --> 19:15.424
Arterialicious.

19:16.505 --> 19:17.606
Oh, shit.

19:17.706 --> 19:19.568
Fuck, Arthur. I'm sorry.
No, no, no.

19:19.668 --> 19:21.610
Don't worry.
I'll take care of that.

19:21.710 --> 19:23.132
You hang this...
Yeah. Okay.

19:23.232 --> 19:24.573
...on the film bin.

19:24.673 --> 19:26.675
I'm sorry.
That's all right.

19:36.485 --> 19:37.746
Arthur,
I need you to make me

19:37.846 --> 19:40.269
one of your maquettes of Max.

19:40.369 --> 19:42.711
I need to look into his eyes

19:42.811 --> 19:44.193
and beg forgiveness
from a ghost.

19:44.293 --> 19:46.755
And maybe he'll forgive me
and maybe he won't.

19:46.855 --> 19:50.199
Maybe I'm damned to follow him
over that cliff.

19:50.299 --> 19:52.301
But I need to know.

19:53.182 --> 19:54.603
That's why I'm here.

20:08.557 --> 20:09.658
Are you okay?

20:09.758 --> 20:12.781
We got a new job.

20:12.881 --> 20:14.503
I'm going to need
you full time

20:14.603 --> 20:16.605
for a few weeks.

20:18.447 --> 20:21.870
Hey, I, uh...
Look, uh...

20:21.970 --> 20:24.033
I know this is weird,

20:24.133 --> 20:28.357
but, uh, whatever
that lady asked you for,

20:28.457 --> 20:31.400
whatever she told you
she was here for,

20:31.500 --> 20:32.601
she wasn't.

20:32.701 --> 20:34.563
Okay? She was lying.

20:34.663 --> 20:36.665
I could tell.

20:37.746 --> 20:38.727
Oh.

20:38.827 --> 20:39.808
Snoop.

20:42.111 --> 20:44.933
I, I don't know what lies mean

20:45.033 --> 20:47.556
when you're that deep in grief.

20:49.598 --> 20:51.700
She's a friend.

20:51.800 --> 20:53.802
I'm gonna help her.

20:55.244 --> 20:57.246
Let's get to work.

20:58.727 --> 21:00.829
So, to help your friend,

21:00.929 --> 21:04.353
we're building a model
of your dead friend's head.

21:04.453 --> 21:06.235
Twisted web.

21:06.335 --> 21:08.117
So this is Max, huh?

21:08.217 --> 21:11.240
And, uh, what's her name? Laura?

21:11.340 --> 21:14.523
Those were the good years,
the early years.

21:14.623 --> 21:16.125
What happened?
Why did you stop
working with them?

21:16.225 --> 21:18.287
Pair of monsters or what?

21:18.387 --> 21:20.389
No, it wasn't that.

21:21.110 --> 21:23.112
Well, what was it?

21:25.074 --> 21:27.096
It was my fault.

21:27.196 --> 21:31.300
It was supposed to be
my big debut as a director.

21:31.400 --> 21:34.383
Creature feature,
<i>Black Lagoon</i> -style.

21:34.483 --> 21:37.626
And we had a terrific,
young actress,

21:37.726 --> 21:39.728
Lily Albern.

21:43.932 --> 21:46.735
She died on the set.

21:49.458 --> 21:53.182
And, and it all died that day.

21:54.944 --> 21:56.946
Christ, Arthur, fuck.

21:57.947 --> 21:59.949
It was an accident.

22:09.278 --> 22:12.862
We were shooting a scene
where she went underwater

22:12.962 --> 22:15.104
<i>and the sea monster
attacked her.</i>

22:15.204 --> 22:19.548
We had a big tank set up
with an emergency system.

22:19.648 --> 22:21.871
If she had an issue
in the tank,

22:21.971 --> 22:23.552
<i>she would hit a button,</i>

22:23.652 --> 22:26.075
<i>and this red
emergency light bulb</i>

22:26.175 --> 22:27.516
would go off,

22:27.616 --> 22:30.840
and we'd cut and pull her out.

22:30.940 --> 22:32.942
Eyebrows.

22:33.702 --> 22:35.124
It was a crazy day.

22:35.224 --> 22:37.566
<i>We were running behind,</i>

22:37.666 --> 22:40.890
and Lily was having trouble
in the tank.

22:40.990 --> 22:44.173
<i>She'd go in,
and the red light would go on.</i>

22:44.273 --> 22:47.576
We would cut and pull her out.

22:47.676 --> 22:49.819
Over and over again.

22:49.919 --> 22:52.101
<i>I got frustrated.</i>

22:52.201 --> 22:54.203
Everybody was.

22:55.284 --> 22:57.146
And then on the last take,

22:57.246 --> 22:58.828
everything went perfect.

22:58.928 --> 23:00.950
<i>The sea monster attacked her.</i>

23:01.050 --> 23:03.472
<i>She thrashed. She struggled.</i>

23:03.572 --> 23:05.755
We got it.

23:05.855 --> 23:08.838
So we were elated.

23:08.938 --> 23:10.940
But...

23:12.141 --> 23:14.243
she wasn't moving.

23:14.343 --> 23:17.987
And when we pulled her
out of the tank...

23:21.270 --> 23:23.272
she was dead.

23:25.034 --> 23:27.336
Fuck.

23:27.436 --> 23:29.819
Why didn't she, uh,
set off the red light bulb?

23:29.919 --> 23:31.100
I don't know.

23:31.200 --> 23:34.503
I, I, I can't believe
that it was

23:34.603 --> 23:37.987
because I was frustrated
with her

23:38.087 --> 23:41.050
and she didn't want
to let me down.

23:42.932 --> 23:44.934
But...

23:45.414 --> 23:47.416
I do believe that.

23:52.301 --> 23:54.303
I believe that...

23:55.504 --> 23:57.506
I killed her.

23:59.388 --> 24:02.051
So that's why you
walked away from all this?

24:02.151 --> 24:04.153
You better believe it.

24:06.395 --> 24:09.859
I, uh, I lost a friend.

24:09.959 --> 24:13.022
She was my best friend.
Uh, Natalie.

24:13.122 --> 24:16.265
And, uh, you know, I wonder
if I could have saved her,

24:16.365 --> 24:18.648
but I didn't.

24:20.009 --> 24:23.512
And so, I walked away too.

24:23.612 --> 24:26.676
You know, I keep thinking
it's behind me, right?

24:26.776 --> 24:29.559
But then I keep just, like,
playing it back out again,

24:29.659 --> 24:31.480
trying to,
trying to make it right,

24:31.580 --> 24:33.442
trying to change it.

24:33.542 --> 24:35.544
I don't know.

24:36.025 --> 24:37.446
I mean, does it ever end?

24:37.546 --> 24:40.790
Do I believe that
the dead can forgive us?

24:42.592 --> 24:45.054
No, I don't believe that.

24:45.154 --> 24:46.576
Bullshit.

24:46.676 --> 24:48.818
What?
I mean, if you didn't think

24:48.918 --> 24:50.259
the dead could forgive us,

24:50.359 --> 24:51.781
you wouldn't be making
your whole movie,

24:51.881 --> 24:53.943
the, uh, <i>The Orpheus Syndrome.</i>

24:54.043 --> 24:55.905
I mean, that's what
it's all about.

24:56.005 --> 24:58.748
Bringing the past back to life
like a ritual of penitence.

24:58.848 --> 25:00.229
Ritual of penitence?

25:00.329 --> 25:01.991
Who appointed you Pope?

25:02.091 --> 25:03.913
I was recently anointed.
Thank you.

25:04.013 --> 25:06.716
I, uh... come on, man.
Cut the shit.

25:06.816 --> 25:08.558
I mean, you got Orpheus

25:08.658 --> 25:10.880
who's going through film gates

25:10.980 --> 25:13.162
into the underworld,
which looks like a water tank

25:13.262 --> 25:15.845
to bring a girl
back from the dead.

25:15.945 --> 25:17.847
The guy's got
a movie camera for a face.

25:17.947 --> 25:20.009
The other guy,
that Cyclops monster,

25:20.109 --> 25:22.772
he's got a red light bulb
for an eye.

25:22.872 --> 25:25.094
I mean, I'm not judging.

25:25.194 --> 25:27.497
Just, you know,
it all makes sense.

25:27.597 --> 25:31.180
You got to revisit the past
to get past it, huh?

25:31.280 --> 25:32.742
You think that's true?

25:32.842 --> 25:36.686
Hey, <i>dominae vomingus dingus.</i>

25:37.847 --> 25:39.589
I'm gonna make some Hot Pockets.

25:39.689 --> 25:41.270
You want some?
Yeah.

25:41.370 --> 25:43.372
All right, Arthur.

25:46.616 --> 25:47.997
It's cool.
Yeah?

25:48.097 --> 25:50.099
Yeah.

26:12.161 --> 26:13.663
LAM Archives.

26:13.763 --> 26:16.426
They still got you
in the basement, huh?

26:18.688 --> 26:23.152
Arthur. Haven't heard your voice
in such a long time.

26:23.252 --> 26:24.514
How are you, my friend?

26:24.614 --> 26:25.595
<i>Uh, I'm fine.</i>

26:25.695 --> 26:27.397
<i>I need you to do a favour.</i>

26:27.497 --> 26:30.920
I need you to pull
some footage for me.

26:31.020 --> 26:35.285
Reel numbers 1-6-6-3-2-3-4

26:35.385 --> 26:39.489
through 1-6-6-3-2-4-6.

26:39.589 --> 26:45.555
That was everything
on April the 12th, 1989.

26:48.438 --> 26:50.260
Are you sure?

26:50.360 --> 26:52.662
That's, um...
<i>I know.</i>

26:52.762 --> 26:55.505
I know what's on there.

26:55.605 --> 26:58.328
I'm not supposed
to check anything out.

26:59.969 --> 27:01.431
But that's okay, buddy.

27:01.531 --> 27:03.313
Um...

27:03.413 --> 27:07.036
Max was digitising everything
for the 40th anniversary.

27:07.136 --> 27:09.959
He got through that pile
of stuff already.

27:10.059 --> 27:11.321
Nobody's going to miss it.

27:11.421 --> 27:12.802
Thank you, old friend.

27:12.902 --> 27:14.564
<i>I'll bring 'em over tomorrow.</i>

27:14.664 --> 27:16.666
Yeah.

27:28.958 --> 27:30.220
Hey, I'm Raoul.

27:30.320 --> 27:34.063
Um, I'm here to deliver
some film to Arthur.

27:34.163 --> 27:35.785
Is he around?

27:35.885 --> 27:36.946
That's terrific. He's inside.

27:37.046 --> 27:38.388
I'm, uh, I'm Charlie,

27:38.488 --> 27:41.711
his, uh, assistant
and head deliverer.

27:41.811 --> 27:43.193
You're the head of delivery.

27:43.293 --> 27:46.396
No, I, uh, I deliver heads.

27:46.496 --> 27:47.957
All right.
All right. Cool.

27:48.057 --> 27:49.199
Yeah, he's right in there.

27:49.299 --> 27:51.000
Okay. Thank you.

27:51.100 --> 27:52.682
I like your car.

27:52.782 --> 27:53.923
I like the Honda.

27:54.023 --> 27:56.426
It's my mother's car. It's okay.

28:02.712 --> 28:07.257
Ah, geez. Nice patch of concrete
too much to ask for, I guess.

28:44.594 --> 28:46.896
<i>That was it. That was it.</i>

28:46.996 --> 28:48.618
Young Arthur:
<i>Jesus fucking Christ!</i>

28:48.718 --> 28:50.300
<i>Are you fucking kidding me?</i>

28:50.400 --> 28:51.981
<i>I can't do it.</i>
Young Arthur: <i>You can do this.</i>

28:52.081 --> 28:53.383
<i>We need you to do this, honey.</i>

28:53.483 --> 28:54.784
<i>This is what
you're being paid for.</i>

28:54.884 --> 28:56.186
<i>This is insane.</i>

30:18.568 --> 30:19.509
Raoul.

30:19.609 --> 30:21.351
How you doing? It's Laura.

30:21.451 --> 30:23.914
I need you to pull
some film for me
and bring it to the house.

30:24.014 --> 30:28.438
It's from the <i>Dragonfish</i>
behind-the-scenes shoot
in the '80s.

30:28.538 --> 30:33.423
It's reel number 1-6-6-3-2-4-6.

30:37.707 --> 30:39.649
<i>I'm sorry.
I don't have it.</i>

30:39.749 --> 30:41.451
Wha-- Uh, what?
What do you mean?

30:41.551 --> 30:44.855
It's with the rest
of the <i>Dragonfish</i> footage.

30:44.955 --> 30:48.218
I don't have any of it.
I checked it out.

30:48.318 --> 30:50.220
What the fuck, checked it out?

30:50.320 --> 30:51.661
What are we, a lending library?

30:51.761 --> 30:54.424
To whom did you check it out?

30:54.524 --> 30:56.226
<i>Sorry, Laura.</i>

30:56.326 --> 30:59.069
<i>Arthur has it.</i>

30:59.169 --> 31:01.952
<i>I'm gonna, I'm gonna
call him right now,
and I'm going to go over there,</i>

31:02.052 --> 31:04.895
<i>and I'm going to...
to go get it for you.</i>

31:09.619 --> 31:12.122
Don't worry about it, Raoul.

31:12.222 --> 31:13.283
Forget I ever called.

31:13.383 --> 31:15.745
<i>Please, don't be mad at me.</i>

31:35.765 --> 31:37.988
I've spent
my whole life thinking

31:38.088 --> 31:40.090
that I killed that girl.

31:42.212 --> 31:44.214
I'm sorry.

31:44.975 --> 31:47.197
If I had thought...

31:47.297 --> 31:49.900
I never would have. I'd never.

31:52.182 --> 31:54.184
I thought she was being...

31:55.065 --> 31:57.607
I don't even know,
an actress,

31:57.707 --> 32:00.250
a silly actress.

32:00.350 --> 32:02.693
And we had put everything
into that production.

32:02.793 --> 32:06.296
Our houses. All of us.

32:06.396 --> 32:08.939
And we were bleeding money.
I shielded you, too.

32:09.039 --> 32:10.941
You didn't even know
how in the hole we were,

32:11.041 --> 32:13.043
every day we went over.

32:14.484 --> 32:18.428
Arthur, it was an accident.

32:18.528 --> 32:21.952
Raoul said that
Max had digitised

32:22.052 --> 32:24.054
these reels.

32:24.534 --> 32:26.536
Did Max see this?

32:28.018 --> 32:30.460
Did he tell you he saw it?

32:33.744 --> 32:34.925
I am so sorry

32:35.025 --> 32:38.508
that you held this
for all these years.

32:40.510 --> 32:42.252
But I did, too.

32:42.352 --> 32:44.334
I did it and I held it

32:44.434 --> 32:47.578
so you boy geniuses
could make your monsters

32:47.678 --> 32:51.582
and not have to wonder
what it all cost.

32:51.682 --> 32:55.065
I was doing the dirty work,
always, for both of you.

32:55.165 --> 32:57.107
And you can pretend
that you didn't see it,

32:57.207 --> 32:59.670
but don't you
fucking judge me for it.

32:59.770 --> 33:02.713
I move forward. Always forward.

33:02.813 --> 33:06.256
And I am not going to lose
what I built.

33:08.619 --> 33:12.062
And you're right that the dead
can't forgive me...

33:14.064 --> 33:16.506
but they also can't hurt me.

33:20.070 --> 33:22.312
Laura, let me ask you this.

33:24.354 --> 33:27.878
Did you have anything
to do with Max's death?

33:30.520 --> 33:33.183
He jumped right in front of me,

33:33.283 --> 33:35.566
like he wanted to punish me.

33:37.247 --> 33:39.249
My hand to God.

33:45.656 --> 33:48.138
No one will see this footage.

34:01.632 --> 34:03.634
Thank you.

34:08.879 --> 34:11.041
Arthur, I am so sorry.

34:41.512 --> 34:43.514
Oh.

35:20.471 --> 35:22.473
Oh, he wouldn't.

35:27.918 --> 35:29.900
Arthur!

35:30.000 --> 35:33.904
Arthur. Arthur.

35:34.004 --> 35:36.227
<i>Stay calm, ma'am. The police
will be there shortly.</i>

35:36.327 --> 35:37.948
<i>Can I get your name
and information?</i>

35:38.048 --> 35:40.991
Would you just,
just send somebody quick?

35:41.091 --> 35:42.873
Okay? Please.

35:42.973 --> 35:44.975
Shit.

35:45.936 --> 35:47.478
Arthur, man.

35:47.578 --> 35:49.840
I'm sorry, I gotta go, okay?

35:49.940 --> 35:51.942
All right.

35:53.584 --> 35:55.586
What the fuck?

36:13.764 --> 36:15.946
Oh, his heart was always...

36:16.046 --> 36:18.909
He always had trouble
with his heart.

36:19.009 --> 36:22.473
I'm just happy he didn't suffer.

36:22.573 --> 36:25.276
I'm calling
with a legal question.

36:25.376 --> 36:27.398
LAM funded Arthur's work.

36:27.498 --> 36:29.880
I'm, I'm wondering
when we can get possession

36:29.980 --> 36:31.982
of his workshop.

36:32.583 --> 36:34.525
Well, today, if we can.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.887
I'd like to see what's there
and pull some pieces

36:36.987 --> 36:40.451
for our 40th anniversary
celebration tonight.

36:40.551 --> 36:42.553
As a tribute.

36:46.397 --> 36:48.399
Okay.

36:48.919 --> 36:50.921
Uh-huh.

36:51.362 --> 36:53.504
Uh-huh.

36:53.604 --> 36:56.647
Okay. Well, work at it
and call me back.

37:13.424 --> 37:15.426
Excuse me.

37:16.867 --> 37:18.889
Hi.
May I help you?

37:18.989 --> 37:20.611
I was, uh...

37:20.711 --> 37:22.173
Hi.

37:22.273 --> 37:24.275
Laura, right?

37:25.276 --> 37:27.818
I'm Charlie. I was, uh...

37:27.918 --> 37:30.761
I was Arthur's assistant.
I dropped off the head.

37:31.442 --> 37:33.184
Right.

37:33.284 --> 37:34.705
How may I help you?

37:34.805 --> 37:36.507
Uh...

37:36.607 --> 37:39.430
Well, gee, this is,
this is sort of weird.

37:39.530 --> 37:41.752
I thought I'd know how
to put it when I got here,

37:41.852 --> 37:46.077
but it was so sudden,
his death.

37:46.177 --> 37:49.320
And, uh, well, I'd gotten
kind of close to him.

37:49.420 --> 37:52.563
Like, I really cared
about the guy.

37:52.663 --> 37:54.165
Anyway...

37:54.265 --> 37:56.727
he never left the house.

37:56.827 --> 38:00.691
Like, literally
never went anywhere.

38:00.791 --> 38:02.533
But I think

38:02.633 --> 38:05.836
maybe the day he died,
he came to see you.

38:06.877 --> 38:08.940
Ah, gosh, I, I'm sorry.

38:09.040 --> 38:10.741
You know what?
I feel really intrusive here.

38:10.841 --> 38:12.783
Maybe I shouldn't have come.

38:12.883 --> 38:14.305
I shouldn't have come.

38:14.405 --> 38:15.826
I'm sorry.

38:15.926 --> 38:18.929
No, I get it.
It's, it's all right.

38:21.012 --> 38:23.194
Why don't you come inside?

38:23.294 --> 38:26.918
Thanks.
My mother had
a framed embroidery thing

38:27.018 --> 38:28.239
over our commode growing up

38:28.339 --> 38:31.122
that said "Strange Blessings."

38:31.222 --> 38:33.404
And that's what yesterday
made me think of.

38:33.504 --> 38:38.089
I didn't expect him,
and he just showed up
out of the blue.

38:38.189 --> 38:39.410
And I'm so glad he did,

38:39.510 --> 38:42.533
that I, I got to say
goodbye to him,

38:42.633 --> 38:44.896
see him one last time.

38:44.996 --> 38:46.377
Strange blessings.

38:46.477 --> 38:49.460
God. But he wanted
to talk about the past.

38:49.560 --> 38:53.064
About Max. All of it.

38:53.164 --> 38:56.267
I'm sorry.
And if I'm overstepping, please.

38:56.367 --> 38:59.510
But, uh, do you feel
like in talking

38:59.610 --> 39:02.273
and whatever you guys said,

39:02.373 --> 39:06.097
that maybe he reconciled
his guilt?

39:07.818 --> 39:10.281
Look, I don't know
what I'm asking. I...

39:10.381 --> 39:13.004
Maybe I just want to know

39:13.104 --> 39:15.366
if he got some peace in the end.

39:15.466 --> 39:16.888
Peace?

39:16.988 --> 39:18.649
I don't know.

39:18.749 --> 39:22.033
Peace, that's, that's
many different things,

39:22.994 --> 39:24.996
but I, I think...

39:25.877 --> 39:29.020
No. I know that he was,

39:29.120 --> 39:30.902
he was able to let go

39:31.002 --> 39:34.245
of blaming himself
for Lily's death.

39:35.326 --> 39:37.468
Does that help you?

39:37.568 --> 39:39.791
Oh, yeah. That's...

39:39.891 --> 39:40.952
that's, wow.

39:41.052 --> 39:44.075
That's, uh, albatross.

39:44.175 --> 39:46.537
Over here. Thank you. I, uh...

39:47.658 --> 39:49.921
Geez. Uh, thanks.

39:50.021 --> 39:51.322
I...

39:51.422 --> 39:53.044
And look, uh,

39:53.144 --> 39:55.606
I'm sorry to show up
and bother you.

39:55.706 --> 39:59.370
No. It feels good to give
someone else some comfort.

39:59.470 --> 40:02.373
Arthur gave me that too
with his maquettes

40:02.473 --> 40:04.295
and our conversation.

40:04.395 --> 40:05.616
That's great.

40:05.716 --> 40:08.740
Yeah, it really did help me.

40:08.840 --> 40:12.664
Yeah. Well, I bet. I bet.
How could it not?

40:12.764 --> 40:14.585
Oh.

40:14.685 --> 40:17.829
Helped me to say goodbye to him
and feel some kind of release

40:17.929 --> 40:20.852
that I wasn't responsible
for Max's death.

40:22.373 --> 40:24.996
Uh, thank you so much
for coming by.

40:25.096 --> 40:27.859
It's really great to meet you.
Take care, Charlie.

40:30.661 --> 40:32.663
Uh...

40:34.946 --> 40:38.369
You said
you weren't responsible?

40:38.469 --> 40:40.291
What?

40:40.391 --> 40:42.814
Uh, could you repeat
what you said before?

40:42.914 --> 40:45.016
I think my hearing is going.

40:45.116 --> 40:48.740
That I wasn't responsible
for Max's death?

40:48.840 --> 40:51.663
And that like Arthur
had to let go,

40:51.763 --> 40:53.625
I have to do the same.

40:53.725 --> 40:56.147
Max's death wasn't my fault.

40:56.247 --> 40:59.350
And Arthur's heart problem
just caught up with him.

40:59.450 --> 41:02.033
Neither were a result
of my actions.

41:02.133 --> 41:04.135
I didn't kill them.

41:07.018 --> 41:09.020
Are you okay?

41:12.383 --> 41:13.484
Yeah.

41:13.584 --> 41:14.886
Well, goodbye, Charlie.

41:14.986 --> 41:17.108
I hope I've given you
some peace.

41:26.317 --> 41:28.319
What?

41:34.606 --> 41:36.588
Hey, Head Delivery.

41:36.688 --> 41:39.471
No, she killed both of them,
okay? She basically told me.

41:39.571 --> 41:41.072
Not even basically.
She just told me.

41:41.172 --> 41:42.674
I mean, not directly,
but, you know,

41:42.774 --> 41:44.476
she was lying, and I could tell
she was lying, so...

41:44.576 --> 41:46.558
What is this,
a woman's intuition?

41:46.658 --> 41:48.880
No, it's not like
a tampon commercial, okay?

41:48.980 --> 41:53.645
It's a real thing.
It's no big deal,
but I can detect lies.

41:53.745 --> 41:55.527
Wait, what are you doing here?

41:55.627 --> 41:56.968
Oh, Arthur,
he checked out some film,

41:57.068 --> 41:59.330
and then Laura
requested the same reel,

41:59.430 --> 42:01.533
so I'm in some deep shit.

42:01.633 --> 42:03.455
And I gotta get it back.
What?

42:03.555 --> 42:05.136
Yeah, I know.
Weird coincidence.

42:05.236 --> 42:08.219
I mean, nobody's looked
at this stuff for years.

42:08.319 --> 42:10.181
Coincidence, my foot.

42:10.281 --> 42:11.583
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

42:11.683 --> 42:13.344
You dropped
the film off to Arthur.

42:13.444 --> 42:15.106
I went to drop
the head off to Laura.

42:15.206 --> 42:16.788
He was watching the film.

42:16.888 --> 42:19.030
Then when I got back
from Laura's,
he had gone there.

42:19.130 --> 42:21.433
So, whatever he saw on that film

42:21.533 --> 42:23.154
made him go to Laura's, yeah?

42:23.254 --> 42:25.076
Okay.

42:25.176 --> 42:27.999
What's on those reels?
It's behind the scenes

42:28.099 --> 42:30.321
of the <i>Dragonfish</i> set
the day Lily died.

42:30.421 --> 42:32.203
Oh, shit.
Yeah, I thought
it was pretty dark.

42:32.303 --> 42:35.567
He wanted to see it,
but he was going
through some shit.

42:35.667 --> 42:38.450
Yeah. Got to face
the past to get past it.

42:40.031 --> 42:41.533
All right, man.

42:41.633 --> 42:44.376
Well, we got
to watch that stuff.

42:44.476 --> 42:45.577
We got to see what he saw.

42:45.677 --> 42:46.818
How does this thing work?

42:46.918 --> 42:49.501
Is it like a VCR?

42:49.601 --> 42:50.902
Hold on. Laptop, please. Yeah.

42:51.002 --> 42:54.546
Laptop. Okay.

42:54.646 --> 42:58.229
Okay. Here, Max was digitising
the entire archives.

42:58.329 --> 43:01.593
I think I could get a copy
from our cloud drive.

43:01.693 --> 43:03.715
Double-Oh face scan, Batman.

43:03.815 --> 43:05.817
Yeah, I know.

43:06.137 --> 43:08.640
Yeah. Security's nuts. Okay.

43:08.740 --> 43:10.442
Good, good. Uh, let's, uh,

43:10.542 --> 43:12.404
let's start with this one,
2-4-6.

43:12.504 --> 43:15.367
Two-four-six. Two-four-six.
Okay.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.808
Hmm. That's weird.

43:16.908 --> 43:18.570
The files showed up
for the reels

43:18.670 --> 43:22.173
245 and 247, but no 246.

43:22.273 --> 43:24.456
Max.
What?

43:24.556 --> 43:27.299
So if Max had this on his files,

43:27.399 --> 43:28.900
you'd need his face, right?

43:29.000 --> 43:31.903
Okay, so, Laura used
the maquette to access the files

43:32.003 --> 43:33.785
and, uh, delete it.

43:33.885 --> 43:35.467
She what?

43:35.567 --> 43:37.228
B-b-but...

43:37.328 --> 43:39.711
Wait a second.

43:39.811 --> 43:41.813
We have the original film.

43:43.575 --> 43:46.318
Oh God. Shit, man.

43:46.418 --> 43:49.200
Arthur was killed for whatever
was on that reel of film.

43:49.300 --> 43:50.642
Look, we got to find it before--

43:52.824 --> 43:54.826
Hide!

44:00.352 --> 44:03.094
All this stuff goes to LAM,

44:03.194 --> 44:06.097
but bag up
the loose film separately.

44:06.197 --> 44:07.779
I'll take care of that myself.

44:07.879 --> 44:10.262
I want every bit of film.
Yes, ma'am.

44:10.362 --> 44:12.864
Don't leave a scrap behind.

44:12.964 --> 44:14.966
You got it.

44:16.328 --> 44:17.509
All right.

44:17.609 --> 44:21.032
Whoever you are,
come out, come out.

44:21.132 --> 44:24.476
I can smell your Hot Pockets.

44:24.576 --> 44:27.779
Come on, fanboy. Out!

44:30.181 --> 44:32.183
Raoul.

44:33.265 --> 44:35.707
What's that?
You tell me.

44:37.789 --> 44:42.374
Arthur brought that reel of film
to my house last night

44:42.474 --> 44:43.975
and burned it.

44:44.075 --> 44:45.457
True. Shit.

44:45.557 --> 44:46.698
He burned it.

44:46.798 --> 44:49.261
It was all destroyed.

44:49.361 --> 44:50.742
Bullshit.
And I don't know

44:50.842 --> 44:52.624
what you think is going on here,

44:52.724 --> 44:55.707
but this is over.

44:55.807 --> 44:58.890
So go get back
in your fucking basement!

45:09.541 --> 45:11.042
Hurry up!

45:11.142 --> 45:12.364
Hurry up!

45:12.464 --> 45:14.486
What are you looking for?

45:14.586 --> 45:17.249
I want every last piece of it.

45:17.349 --> 45:19.651
Don't miss a single
loose scrap of film.

45:19.751 --> 45:22.654
I want it all bagged up.
It's going to me.

45:22.754 --> 45:24.756
He spliced it out.

45:35.127 --> 45:37.989
Yeah, I'll take
the Medusa head next.

45:38.089 --> 45:40.092
Man 2: Need help with that?

45:44.656 --> 45:46.658
There it is.

45:56.588 --> 45:58.590
That's great.

45:59.511 --> 46:02.374
I, I also want
to have a, a tribute

46:02.474 --> 46:04.456
to Arthur tonight.

46:04.556 --> 46:06.538
All the maquettes
from his workshop,

46:06.638 --> 46:07.819
from my home, from the office,

46:07.919 --> 46:09.581
I want a whole room

46:09.681 --> 46:11.103
dedicated to him

46:11.203 --> 46:15.107
and to the film
that he never got to finish.

46:15.207 --> 46:18.310
Well, I'll be there in an hour.
Get it done.

46:18.410 --> 46:21.113
This evening is going to belong

46:21.213 --> 46:23.215
to Arthur and Max.

46:39.871 --> 46:41.894
Laura wants all this stuff
up on the second floor.
Yeah, yeah.

46:41.994 --> 46:44.536
Okay? And we don't have
much time.
We're already running late.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.058
Why are you carrying it
like a baby?

46:46.158 --> 46:48.380
He's fragile.

46:48.480 --> 46:50.102
Oh, fuck my life.

46:50.202 --> 46:52.424
...gone in, like,
five minutes upstairs.

46:52.524 --> 46:53.866
You're not Laura.

46:53.966 --> 46:55.387
Okay, but I'm speaking
for Laura.

47:05.337 --> 47:09.641
...35 millimeter,
which I particularly love
the most, yeah.

47:09.741 --> 47:12.945
So, pretty much, uh...

47:14.987 --> 47:17.169
Can you please hold on a minute?

47:17.269 --> 47:19.271
Thank you.

47:20.712 --> 47:21.613
What's going on?

47:21.713 --> 47:23.055
It's company policy

47:23.155 --> 47:25.497
that nothing leaves
the archives.

47:25.597 --> 47:27.179
You violated that policy,

47:27.279 --> 47:29.561
so I'm afraid we're going
to have to let you go.

47:32.444 --> 47:33.906
Are you serious, Laura?

47:34.006 --> 47:35.868
It's company policy.

47:35.968 --> 47:36.989
It's me.

47:37.089 --> 47:39.912
Hey, look me in the eyes, Laura.

47:40.012 --> 47:42.594
Laura, what is wrong with you?

47:43.735 --> 47:46.198
Security will escort you out.

47:46.298 --> 47:47.960
Um, we have a problem.

47:48.060 --> 47:50.863
There's a horse loose
on the premises.

48:10.883 --> 48:12.825
Where are you,
witchy woman?

48:12.925 --> 48:15.307
Where are you, witchy woman?

48:15.407 --> 48:17.069
Not here.

48:17.169 --> 48:18.470
Medusa?

48:18.570 --> 48:21.173
No, not Medusa. Shit.

48:26.658 --> 48:28.120
Ah? Oh, yes!

48:28.220 --> 48:30.222
There it is.

48:30.662 --> 48:32.244
Oh, shit.

48:32.344 --> 48:34.727
Horse, who are you?

48:34.827 --> 48:36.168
Oh.

48:36.268 --> 48:37.569
Hi.

48:37.669 --> 48:40.452
Okay. Uh, all right,
all right, all right.

48:40.552 --> 48:44.176
I'm sorry.
This thing is not designed
for quick removal.

48:44.276 --> 48:47.099
Escort her off the premises.

48:47.199 --> 48:50.663
And if she steps one hoof
on this property again,

48:50.763 --> 48:52.765
have her arrested.

48:55.928 --> 48:58.190
Oh, my God, look.

48:58.290 --> 49:00.352
Look, that's the horse
from <i>Caligula's Revenge.</i>

49:00.452 --> 49:02.154
That's so cool.

49:02.254 --> 49:04.256
Amazing.

49:04.777 --> 49:06.759
Charlie?

49:06.859 --> 49:09.401
Raoul. Hey.

49:09.501 --> 49:10.963
Okay. I'm not even going to ask.

49:11.063 --> 49:12.204
Oh, it's my purse.

49:12.304 --> 49:14.687
Uh, listen, so I found the film.

49:14.787 --> 49:17.129
Okay. Check it out.
He spliced part of it out.

49:17.229 --> 49:18.530
And then he hid it
in one of his monsters

49:18.630 --> 49:20.292
in the, uh, in the snake hair.

49:20.392 --> 49:21.533
The Medusa from <i>Zazamoosh.</i>

49:21.633 --> 49:23.295
Yes. Yeah, the Medusa from that.

49:23.395 --> 49:25.778
Shit, wait.

49:25.878 --> 49:27.860
Is that one of those sad
"you're fired" boxes?

49:27.960 --> 49:29.662
Yeah. You know, 40 years, man.

49:29.762 --> 49:31.824
She couldn't even look me
in the eye when she did it.

49:31.924 --> 49:33.786
Shit, man. I'm sorry, that's--

49:33.886 --> 49:36.148
I was sick of that basement,

49:36.248 --> 49:37.750
and I guess she was a murderer.

49:37.850 --> 49:40.432
So time was right.

49:40.532 --> 49:42.154
Hey, uh,

49:42.254 --> 49:45.257
you think your, uh,
keycard is turned off yet?

49:47.700 --> 49:49.081
Thank you, everyone.

49:49.181 --> 49:53.045
We are so glad
that you are here.

49:53.145 --> 49:55.287
Tonight is bittersweet.

49:55.387 --> 49:59.011
I never expected
to be celebrating

49:59.111 --> 50:02.294
without Arthur
and Max by my side.

50:02.394 --> 50:04.897
Okay.
It's now or never, right?

50:04.997 --> 50:06.619
Oh, no.
It's going to be now. Okay.

50:06.719 --> 50:09.301
I know that
if they were here tonight,

50:09.401 --> 50:12.084
they would be so happy...

50:15.127 --> 50:16.789
about what I have done

50:16.889 --> 50:19.411
to keep this company alive.

50:22.655 --> 50:24.557
Or at the very least,

50:24.657 --> 50:26.659
they would understand.

50:28.621 --> 50:32.324
I, I hope that
they would understand

50:32.424 --> 50:34.426
why I did what I did.

50:38.631 --> 50:41.133
Ooh.

50:47.439 --> 50:49.441
I'm sorry. I...

50:51.003 --> 50:53.005
Very funny.

50:56.889 --> 51:00.993
As we look back
on our history...

51:01.093 --> 51:03.836
there are so many moments
to be proud of.

51:03.936 --> 51:06.639
The... When Lily died

51:06.739 --> 51:08.601
on the set of <i>Dragonfish,</i>

51:08.701 --> 51:12.164
I thought
it would end us forever.

51:12.264 --> 51:15.087
But... tonight,

51:15.187 --> 51:17.850
we put the past behind us

51:17.950 --> 51:20.132
once and for all!

51:22.394 --> 51:24.136
What I mean is,

51:24.236 --> 51:26.238
the past cannot...

51:27.480 --> 51:29.482
Sorry.
Excuse me.

51:30.683 --> 51:33.826
The past, uh, cannot...

51:33.926 --> 51:35.267
hurt us.

51:35.367 --> 51:36.869
I, um...

51:36.969 --> 51:38.971
I'm, this is...

51:42.334 --> 51:44.336
I have to go...

51:46.379 --> 51:48.381
Just...

51:48.821 --> 51:50.823
play it.

52:05.998 --> 52:10.062
<i>LAM began as a humble
practical effects shop</i>

52:10.162 --> 52:13.386
<i>conceived by three
CalArts animation students</i>

52:13.486 --> 52:15.828
<i>in 1975.</i>

52:15.928 --> 52:19.752
<i>Arthur, Max, and Laura
founded the company</i>

52:19.852 --> 52:22.154
<i>on one simple idea,</i>

52:22.254 --> 52:25.298
<i>that imagination
could be made real.</i>

52:29.021 --> 52:32.285
<i>This collective childhood love
of monsters</i>

52:32.385 --> 52:34.607
<i>is what inspired them
to build LAM.</i>

52:34.707 --> 52:37.530
<i>Throughout the years,
this powerful trio</i>

52:37.630 --> 52:40.653
<i>have set the standard
for monster creation.</i>

52:40.753 --> 52:42.975
<i>And in order to feel real,</i>

52:43.075 --> 52:45.498
<i>it has to be real.</i>

52:45.598 --> 52:49.382
<i>We see, uh, creation
of life from clay</i>

52:49.482 --> 52:51.023
<i>not only in the Bible,</i>

52:51.123 --> 52:54.767

52:56.208 --> 52:57.630
<i>When I'm in my studio...</i>

52:59.492 --> 53:01.934
<i>...I am bringing things

53:04.937 --> 53:06.319
<i>And there's
just no other feeling...</i>

53:06.419 --> 53:08.201
Stop it! Shut it off!

53:08.301 --> 53:09.602
Young Arthur: <i>You feel like...</i>

53:09.702 --> 53:11.043
Shut it off!

53:11.143 --> 53:13.145
<i>...you're divine.</i>

53:24.917 --> 53:27.320
Shut it off. Shut it off.

53:30.002 --> 53:31.824
Stop it!

53:31.924 --> 53:33.926
Stop it!

54:19.492 --> 54:21.494
Oh...

54:28.381 --> 54:30.383
Max.

54:36.389 --> 54:38.391
Max?

54:39.712 --> 54:41.714
Max!

54:42.635 --> 54:44.637
Max!

54:47.920 --> 54:50.183
Look into my eyes, Laura.

54:50.283 --> 54:52.285
Remember this.

54:54.687 --> 54:56.689
No!

55:08.301 --> 55:10.303
Hey.
Charlie.

55:14.067 --> 55:16.069
Oh, fuck.
