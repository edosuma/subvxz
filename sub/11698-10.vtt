WEBVTT

00:00.610 --> 00:01.930
Okay, ten more seconds.

00:01.935 --> 00:04.578
I don't know. Oh, man with a
trench coat? A man taking pictures?

00:04.580 --> 00:05.640
It's a movie!

00:05.650 --> 00:06.817
No talking!

00:06.851 --> 00:07.884
I don't know. Give me
another clue or something.

00:07.919 --> 00:09.720
- Oh, ooh, ooh!
- Time!

00:09.754 --> 00:11.755
"Flashdance!"

00:11.789 --> 00:12.923
Oh, of course. Now I...

00:12.957 --> 00:14.758
no, I still don't get it. I'm sorry.

00:14.792 --> 00:15.892
Okay, okay. Time for the lightning round.

00:15.927 --> 00:16.893
Mom. Tucker.

00:16.928 --> 00:17.961
- Oh, yeah.
- Let's go.

00:17.996 --> 00:18.962
Ow.

00:20.798 --> 00:22.699
Okay, name as many of these
movies as you can in 20 seconds.

00:22.734 --> 00:23.734
Stretch it out, baby. Stretch it out.

00:23.768 --> 00:25.002
- Got it.
- Me and you.

00:25.036 --> 00:26.803
- All right. Baby, please.
- Stretch it out.

00:26.838 --> 00:29.740
Mrs. Wheeler, I'm in your brain here.

00:29.774 --> 00:30.774
Okay...

00:30.808 --> 00:32.042
- Go!
- Here we go.

00:33.645 --> 00:34.978
"Hakuna matata." "The Lion King."

00:35.013 --> 00:36.013
Yes!

00:39.984 --> 00:41.685
"Nobody puts baby in the corner."

00:41.719 --> 00:42.719
"Dirty Dancing."

00:42.754 --> 00:43.820
Yes!

00:46.658 --> 00:47.858
"A dingo ate my baby."

00:47.892 --> 00:48.892
"A Cry in the Dark."

00:48.926 --> 00:50.060
Yes, five seconds.

00:50.094 --> 00:51.594
Five seconds.

00:52.830 --> 00:54.698
"Hasta la vista, baby."

00:54.732 --> 00:55.932
"Terminator 2"

00:55.967 --> 00:57.734
- No!
- Yes!

00:57.769 --> 00:58.802
That is time!

00:58.836 --> 01:02.539
Okay, now as we pause
for a brief snack update,

01:02.573 --> 01:05.776
the current score is mom and Tucker with

01:05.810 --> 01:06.977
197.

01:07.011 --> 01:08.945
And Danny and Amy with 3.

01:09.130 --> 01:10.730
Ooh.

01:10.764 --> 01:12.165
- I'm so sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:12.200 --> 01:14.067
Just be glad that Riley isn't here.

01:14.101 --> 01:17.003
She and I are amazing together.

01:17.038 --> 01:20.006
At games. Just games.

01:20.041 --> 01:21.174
It's okay, I get it.

01:21.209 --> 01:24.744
Lifelong friends. You know, besties.

01:24.778 --> 01:26.179
I do often discuss it with my colleagues,

01:26.214 --> 01:28.114
but I get it.

01:28.149 --> 01:29.716
So where is she?

01:29.750 --> 01:31.117
Oh, she's getting one last cram session in

01:31.152 --> 01:33.854
before she finally takes
the bar exam tomorrow.

01:33.888 --> 01:35.856
I cannot believe our little Riley

01:35.890 --> 01:37.924
is finally gonna be a real lawyer,

01:37.959 --> 01:40.160
which is good because I've got
a ton of people I want to sue.

01:42.230 --> 01:44.097
Hey, we should throw her
a party tomorrow night

01:44.131 --> 01:46.066
or at least throw ourselves
a party and invite her.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.801
We actually can't do tomorrow night.

01:48.836 --> 01:50.203
We're meeting my dad for dinner

01:50.238 --> 01:52.038
so Danny can try and win him over.

01:52.073 --> 01:53.773
I already met your dad.

01:53.807 --> 01:55.742
He loves me.

01:55.776 --> 01:58.011
Love is very strong word.

01:58.045 --> 02:00.981
Well, he at least likes me, right?

02:01.015 --> 02:03.116
We're busy tomorrow night.

02:04.185 --> 02:05.852
Okay, and we're back.

02:05.887 --> 02:06.853
Amy, I believe you're up.

02:06.888 --> 02:07.854
Oh, oh.

02:07.889 --> 02:09.021
Okay, I got this.

02:09.056 --> 02:10.156
Oh, oh, "Message in a Bottle."

02:11.725 --> 02:12.993
No no, "Eat, Pray, Love."

02:14.862 --> 02:15.962
"The Breakfast Club!"

02:17.731 --> 02:19.966
No, I was just feeding my
baby, but good guesses though.

02:33.147 --> 02:34.714
No no.

02:34.748 --> 02:36.082
That is not how it went down.

02:36.117 --> 02:37.117
I owned you. Admit it.

02:37.151 --> 02:39.719
- I'm the man.
- There is no way, okay.

02:39.753 --> 02:41.121
You are not the man. I am the man.

02:43.857 --> 02:46.826
Don't do that.

02:46.860 --> 02:48.061
Okay, so maybe you are the man.

02:49.763 --> 02:51.064
Sorry, it's just...

02:51.098 --> 02:52.165
it's been a day.

02:52.199 --> 02:54.734
Oh, and I dropped my purse in there twice.

02:54.768 --> 02:56.136
So if you find a really
expensive moisturizer

02:56.170 --> 02:57.737
on the floor next to the toilet,

02:57.771 --> 03:00.073
it's yours.

03:00.107 --> 03:01.808
So you're finished taking the bar.

03:01.842 --> 03:02.842
How did it go?

03:02.876 --> 03:03.843
Who am I kidding? It's you.

03:03.877 --> 03:05.946
You nailed it!

03:05.980 --> 03:07.847
Um, do you know when Danny will be home?

03:07.881 --> 03:09.749
Uh, no. He's with Amy and her dad.

03:09.783 --> 03:11.818
Wait, why are you looking for Danny?

03:11.852 --> 03:13.119
Oh, um, no reason.

03:13.154 --> 03:14.754
I just wanted to talk
to him about something.

03:14.788 --> 03:16.856
About what? About the test?

03:16.890 --> 03:18.091
Why won't you talk to me about the test?

03:18.125 --> 03:19.792
Clearly, I'm interested.

03:19.827 --> 03:21.828
Please notice how many times I've asked.

03:21.862 --> 03:25.165
No offense, it's just something
I'd rather talk to him about.

03:25.199 --> 03:27.733
How is that not offensive?

03:27.768 --> 03:29.970
Because we have a different
kind of friendship.

03:30.004 --> 03:31.972
Hey, I can be a different kind of friend.

03:32.006 --> 03:35.775
What are you looking
for? Supportive? Playful?

03:35.809 --> 03:36.909
Dangerous?

03:38.012 --> 03:39.145
Tucker,

03:39.180 --> 03:40.947
tell her how great of a friend I am.

03:40.982 --> 03:42.748
Yeah, Ben's a great friend.

03:42.783 --> 03:44.184
On the friend scale, I'd
give him like a seven...

03:45.752 --> 03:48.855
out of seven.

03:48.889 --> 03:50.823
See?

03:50.858 --> 03:51.824
Why won't you tell me what's going on?

03:51.859 --> 03:53.826
God, because nothing is going on.

03:53.861 --> 03:54.894
Okay? I swear.

03:54.928 --> 03:56.863
Just tell Danny I stopped by.

04:01.102 --> 04:02.668
Call me crazy,

04:02.703 --> 04:03.870
but I don't think Riley wants to talk to me

04:03.904 --> 04:05.138
about the test.

04:05.172 --> 04:07.007
She seemed really upset.

04:07.041 --> 04:09.675
I don't think she did as
well as you think she did.

04:09.710 --> 04:10.743
Tucker, Riley's never messed up

04:10.777 --> 04:11.777
on anything in her life.

04:11.812 --> 04:13.046
Trust me, there is no way

04:13.080 --> 04:15.915
she failed that test.

04:15.949 --> 04:18.851
Well, maybe she failed a different test.

04:20.087 --> 04:23.156
Unless this is your home pregnancy kit.

04:26.760 --> 04:28.094
I can't believe your dad doesn't like me.

04:28.129 --> 04:30.997
You'll be fine. Just be yourself.

04:31.032 --> 04:33.133
But if you could like sit up straight,

04:33.167 --> 04:34.767
and use a few big words,

04:34.801 --> 04:35.768
and look him right in the eye when you talk

04:35.802 --> 04:37.737
that would be great.

04:37.771 --> 04:39.705
Oh, here he comes.

04:39.740 --> 04:41.141
- Daddy.
- Princess.

04:41.175 --> 04:42.142
Hi.

04:42.176 --> 04:44.010
You remember Danny my boy...

04:44.045 --> 04:46.946
very good... say hi, Danny.

04:46.980 --> 04:49.049
Professor Shaw, enjoying your stay so far?

04:49.083 --> 04:50.183
I'll tell you after dinner.

04:50.217 --> 04:51.784
Okay.

04:51.818 --> 04:53.086
So why don't I get my boys a drink?

04:53.120 --> 04:54.987
My dad here is kind of a beer snob.

04:55.022 --> 04:57.790
You two can sit down and get to
know each other a little better.

04:57.824 --> 04:59.892
Daddy, be nice.

05:02.063 --> 05:05.665
So, sir.

05:05.699 --> 05:07.667
Read any good literature lately?

05:07.701 --> 05:08.868
Please notice I didn't say "book"

05:08.902 --> 05:10.703
because that only has four letters.

05:10.737 --> 05:13.839
Look, Wheeler, let's get one thing clear.

05:13.874 --> 05:15.708
I don't want you dating my daughter.

05:15.742 --> 05:16.709
Why not?

05:16.743 --> 05:18.744
Oh, come on. Hockey?

05:18.779 --> 05:19.779
What is that?

05:19.813 --> 05:21.147
Oh, it's a game.

05:21.182 --> 05:22.915
There's six players on each side.

05:22.950 --> 05:24.984
It's kind of like soccer, but on ice.

05:25.018 --> 05:27.019
I'm surprised you haven't heard of it.

05:27.054 --> 05:29.822
Okay, I'm gonna keep this very simple,

05:29.856 --> 05:31.958
which is seemingly necessary.

05:31.992 --> 05:33.793
Stay away from Amy.

05:33.827 --> 05:34.961
She doesn't need some ice jockey

05:34.995 --> 05:36.862
who's gonna be gone at
the first sign of trouble.

05:36.897 --> 05:39.832
I want you out of her life
before I leave on Sunday.

05:39.866 --> 05:40.933
So...

05:40.968 --> 05:42.034
How's everything going?

05:42.069 --> 05:43.936
Wonderful. Couldn't be better.

05:43.971 --> 05:46.038
Well, maybe a little better.

05:49.776 --> 05:51.944
I've got good news.

05:51.979 --> 05:53.980
I'm not pregnant.

05:54.014 --> 05:56.716
Tucker...

05:56.750 --> 05:58.084
What? Dude, I have always wanted

05:58.119 --> 05:59.852
to try one of these things.

05:59.886 --> 06:01.821
Dude, but I got to tell you

06:01.855 --> 06:03.889
hitting the stick is not that easy.

06:05.092 --> 06:07.026
I can't believe Riley might be pregnant.

06:07.060 --> 06:09.695
I can't believe this thing
doesn't come with a cup.

06:11.999 --> 06:13.833
You know, and then you could just dip.

06:13.867 --> 06:15.801
Tucker!

06:15.836 --> 06:16.936
I'm serious.

06:16.970 --> 06:19.071
And why won't she talk to me about it?

06:19.106 --> 06:20.740
I should be her go-to guy on this.

06:20.774 --> 06:22.708
I'm the one with the baby, not Danny.

06:22.743 --> 06:24.076
Let's face it, Ben.

06:24.111 --> 06:27.046
Sensitive is not the first
thing women say about you.

06:27.080 --> 06:29.682
Not if I do it right.

06:29.716 --> 06:31.151
Dude,

06:31.185 --> 06:33.986
there is a reason why Riley
doesn't want to talk to you.

06:34.021 --> 06:35.821
I mean Danny wouldn't be sitting out here

06:35.856 --> 06:38.090
wondering why she doesn't
think he's a good friend.

06:38.125 --> 06:39.759
What would he be doing?

06:39.793 --> 06:42.895
He'd be over there right
now being a good friend.

06:42.929 --> 06:44.830
Danny's awesome, isn't he?

06:47.934 --> 06:50.136
Oh, I should go over
there and be a good friend?

06:51.738 --> 06:53.873
Good idea, tuck.

06:55.776 --> 06:57.009
Ben, what are you doing here?

06:57.044 --> 06:59.045
Just being a sensitive
and supportive friend.

07:00.747 --> 07:03.683
So is there anything I can
sensitively support you on?

07:03.717 --> 07:06.653
Yeah, do you think you could help me

07:06.687 --> 07:07.687
with my friend Ben

07:07.721 --> 07:08.854
because he's acting like a crazy person?

07:10.057 --> 07:11.724
Riley, I know about the test.

07:13.060 --> 07:14.794
You do?

07:14.828 --> 07:15.928
Look, I understand why you don't want

07:15.962 --> 07:17.096
to tell anyone.

07:17.130 --> 07:19.666
But trust me, you don't want
to go through this alone.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.668
You're right.

07:23.136 --> 07:24.671
Thank you.

07:24.705 --> 07:26.906
Okay.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.741
That wasn't so hard.

07:28.775 --> 07:32.845
So should we sit down? Maybe make some tea?

07:32.879 --> 07:33.946
I'm not quite sure how this works.

07:33.980 --> 07:36.048
Uh,

07:36.083 --> 07:38.685
I'm devastated.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.854
So you get the results?

07:41.888 --> 07:43.089
Well, I failed.

07:43.123 --> 07:45.925
I never know if that
actually means yes or a no.

07:45.959 --> 07:48.794
Ben, I never even took the test.

07:48.829 --> 07:50.763
Wait, then how do you know you're pregnant?

07:50.797 --> 07:52.798
Pregnant?!

07:52.833 --> 07:53.899
Why would I be pregnant?

07:53.934 --> 07:56.802
Well, I assumed it involved alcohol

07:56.837 --> 07:58.070
and some poor judgment,

07:58.105 --> 08:00.673
but maybe that's just my story.

08:00.708 --> 08:02.775
Ben, I'm not pregnant.

08:02.809 --> 08:04.110
I failed the bar.

08:04.144 --> 08:06.045
That's it?

08:06.079 --> 08:07.913
You failed the bar? That's your big secret?

08:09.717 --> 08:11.016
Why don't you just take it again?

08:11.051 --> 08:13.018
I have taken it again.

08:13.053 --> 08:14.954
I've taken it three times.

08:14.988 --> 08:15.988
Wow.

08:16.022 --> 08:17.089
Does Danny know?

08:17.124 --> 08:18.824
No.

08:18.859 --> 08:20.025
I haven't told anyone.

08:20.060 --> 08:24.731
So then technically I know four
things that Danny doesn't know.

08:26.967 --> 08:28.834
I'm sorry, you were saying?

08:28.869 --> 08:30.102
Ben, it's over.

08:30.137 --> 08:31.937
The first time, I choked.

08:31.972 --> 08:34.073
And I nearly passed out the second time.

08:34.107 --> 08:37.042
And this time I just... I just walked out.

08:37.077 --> 08:38.711
I panicked.

08:38.746 --> 08:40.011
Wait, I'm confused.

08:40.046 --> 08:42.682
What is there to be confused about?

08:42.716 --> 08:43.716
I'm a failure.

08:43.751 --> 08:44.950
No, I get that.

08:46.754 --> 08:50.089
If you're not pregnant,

08:50.123 --> 08:52.057
then who is?

08:52.092 --> 08:53.926
You're pregnant?!

08:59.535 --> 09:01.403
I am so sorry.

09:01.437 --> 09:03.438
I did not want you to find out this way.

09:03.472 --> 09:04.472
Really?

09:04.506 --> 09:06.308
Because finding my son's girlfriend

09:06.342 --> 09:07.575
crawling around the bathroom floor

09:07.609 --> 09:09.544
crying "where is it? Where is it?"

09:09.578 --> 09:11.679
Seems like the perfect
way for me to find out

09:11.713 --> 09:14.282
I'm gonna be a grandmother again!

09:14.317 --> 09:16.684
I, mean... oh. My God.

09:16.718 --> 09:19.321
If I can lose a little
cardboard box that easily,

09:19.355 --> 09:20.688
what am I gonna do with a kid?

09:20.722 --> 09:22.757
All right, calm down.

09:22.791 --> 09:25.293
Just calm down, okay?

09:25.328 --> 09:27.728
Fortunately you came to the right person.

09:27.763 --> 09:30.332
I'm an expert at unplanned pregnancies.

09:31.700 --> 09:34.336
The first thing we need to do

09:34.370 --> 09:35.536
is get you another test.

09:35.571 --> 09:37.672
I know. I've been trying,
but my dad is in town.

09:37.706 --> 09:39.441
And you know, taking him to the pharmacy

09:39.475 --> 09:40.675
to buy a pregnancy test

09:40.709 --> 09:42.710
isn't exactly father-daughter bonding.

09:42.744 --> 09:45.613
Dads don't really seem
to have a sense of humor

09:45.647 --> 09:46.681
about those kind of things.

09:47.749 --> 09:49.351
So does Danny know?

09:49.385 --> 09:50.618
Oh, my God, no. No no no.

09:50.652 --> 09:52.354
I don't want him to know until I know.

09:52.388 --> 09:53.455
Promise me you're not gonna

09:53.489 --> 09:54.456
say anything about this to him.

09:54.490 --> 09:56.391
Hey, ladies!

09:56.425 --> 09:57.392
What's up?

09:57.426 --> 09:59.660
Danny, what are you doing here?

09:59.695 --> 10:02.364
I live here.

10:02.398 --> 10:04.432
Honey, would you do your mom a favor?

10:04.467 --> 10:05.500
Could you move my car for me?

10:05.534 --> 10:06.501
Sure.

10:06.535 --> 10:07.535
I'll be right back, babe.

10:07.569 --> 10:09.404
He'll be gone for a while.

10:09.438 --> 10:11.473
My car's in the shop.

10:11.507 --> 10:13.508
Oh, my God. Babe? Babe?

10:13.542 --> 10:14.675
Did you hear that? He called me babe.

10:14.710 --> 10:16.344
Because he never calls me babe.

10:16.379 --> 10:18.346
Oh, my God, he knows.

10:18.381 --> 10:20.348
Men never know.

10:20.383 --> 10:21.749
Danny's dad didn't find out

10:21.783 --> 10:23.618
until halfway through the
sonogram when he asked,

10:23.652 --> 10:25.586
"What's this movie about again?"

10:27.490 --> 10:28.523
Riley, I promise you.

10:28.557 --> 10:29.724
It's not as bad as you think it is.

10:29.758 --> 10:31.792
Oh, um, actually, it's worse.

10:31.827 --> 10:33.428
I got fired.

10:33.462 --> 10:34.629
Why would they do that?

10:34.663 --> 10:36.364
Oh, right, it's a law firm.

10:36.399 --> 10:38.500
They probably want someone who
knows something about the law.

10:38.534 --> 10:41.403
And I think we're done talking.

10:41.437 --> 10:42.537
Now if you'll excuse me,

10:42.571 --> 10:43.738
I have to get ready for work.

10:43.772 --> 10:44.839
Wait.

10:44.873 --> 10:46.674
I thought you said you got fired from work.

10:46.708 --> 10:48.776
Uh, I did, but I still
have to pay the rent.

10:48.810 --> 10:50.611
So if you're not gonna be a lawyer,

10:50.646 --> 10:51.646
what are you gonna do?

10:51.680 --> 10:52.847
I have no idea.

10:52.881 --> 10:55.383
I'm still figuring that part out.

10:55.418 --> 10:57.718
All I know is I fought
the law and the law won.

10:57.753 --> 10:59.787
Great. Now that song's gonna be stuck

10:59.821 --> 11:01.556
in my head all day.

11:01.590 --> 11:03.658
Now, I just want to do something stupid

11:03.692 --> 11:05.326
and mindless, you know?

11:05.361 --> 11:07.595
Where I can just like totally blend in.

11:14.803 --> 11:17.405
So you're gonna start your
own hot chocolate factory?

11:20.543 --> 11:22.544
No.

11:22.578 --> 11:24.546
I'm a beer wench at the new Biergarten.

11:24.580 --> 11:25.746
I mean it's not the law,

11:25.781 --> 11:27.748
but, you know, at least it's dignified.

11:33.722 --> 11:35.690
Hey, ma.

11:35.724 --> 11:38.393
Danny, hi. Hi.

11:38.427 --> 11:40.428
What are you doing here?

11:40.463 --> 11:41.529
Um, can I talk to you about Amy?

11:41.564 --> 11:43.364
Oh, my God, yes!

11:43.399 --> 11:46.767
Oh, gosh, I'm so glad that she told you.

11:46.802 --> 11:47.835
Told me what?

11:53.709 --> 11:55.543
That her father hates me?!

11:55.578 --> 11:56.644
Yes!

11:56.678 --> 11:59.614
I've just never had this problem before.

11:59.648 --> 12:00.715
Fathers love me.

12:00.749 --> 12:02.617
It's Ben they usually can't stand.

12:02.651 --> 12:04.486
Well, you might have more
in common with your brother

12:04.520 --> 12:06.721
than you think, Danny. You know what?

12:06.755 --> 12:08.590
Just take him out for a beer.

12:08.624 --> 12:10.358
Have a real dad-to-da...

12:10.392 --> 12:12.427
man-to-man talk with him.

12:12.461 --> 12:14.429
You know what?

12:14.463 --> 12:16.331
You're right. Thanks, mom.

12:16.365 --> 12:17.565
- Yeah, yeah.
- Oh, and uh,

12:17.600 --> 12:18.633
if I ever have a son,

12:18.667 --> 12:20.668
I'm definitely sending
him to you for advice.

12:22.571 --> 12:23.804
First thing we're gonna talk about is

12:23.839 --> 12:25.607
how to put on a condom.

12:28.577 --> 12:29.611
Hey, mom, what's going on?

12:29.645 --> 12:31.712
Nothing. Not a thing.

12:31.747 --> 12:33.481
What's new with you?

12:33.516 --> 12:35.683
Has anyone ever told you something

12:35.717 --> 12:37.418
and you swore not to tell anyone else,

12:37.453 --> 12:40.555
but you just so really
need to tell somebody else?

12:40.589 --> 12:41.822
Oh, you have no idea!

12:43.725 --> 12:44.792
Wait.

12:44.826 --> 12:47.595
Wait, Ben, did somebody trust you

12:47.630 --> 12:49.597
with something personal and private?

12:49.632 --> 12:51.699
Maybe.

12:51.733 --> 12:54.402
If you tell me,

12:54.436 --> 12:58.606
I'll tell you something
of equal or greater value.

13:00.576 --> 13:01.709
No, I can't. I can't.

13:03.612 --> 13:05.313
But maybe if you guess...

13:05.347 --> 13:06.314
How many words?

13:06.348 --> 13:07.615
Four.

13:07.650 --> 13:08.749
Two. Okay, go.

13:12.521 --> 13:14.389
I don't know what you're doing.

13:14.423 --> 13:15.423
Well, I don't know what you're doing.

13:15.457 --> 13:16.591
- Pay attention.
- You pay attention!

13:23.732 --> 13:27.335
Riley failed the bar and Amy's pregnant!

13:27.369 --> 13:28.336
Yes!

13:30.606 --> 13:32.607
What do you mean "Amy's pregnant"?

13:39.171 --> 13:41.072
I just don't know why she wouldn't tell me.

13:41.107 --> 13:42.374
I mean, I can handle it.

13:44.343 --> 13:47.145
You know there was half
a sandwich in that bag

13:47.179 --> 13:48.246
when you started, right?

13:50.016 --> 13:52.250
Oh, my God, I'm supposed to meet Amy's dad.

13:52.285 --> 13:53.451
What am I supposed to tell him?

13:53.485 --> 13:55.086
Okay, honey, don't worry.

13:55.121 --> 13:56.321
I'll handle Amy. I'll let you know

13:56.355 --> 13:57.455
the minute I hear anything.

13:57.489 --> 13:58.456
Okay, you'll do great.

14:01.260 --> 14:03.128
I'm just saying... okay.

14:03.162 --> 14:05.230
Now I think I've been real cool

14:05.264 --> 14:07.198
because I let one baby move in.

14:07.233 --> 14:09.200
Right?

14:09.235 --> 14:11.236
But if y'all got another one on the way,

14:11.270 --> 14:14.239
I am so getting that cat.

14:18.344 --> 14:21.146
Okay, what is with you boys?

14:21.180 --> 14:23.949
Two grand-babies out of wedlock?!

14:23.983 --> 14:26.985
I mean, people are gonna start
calling me old and trashy.

14:27.019 --> 14:28.253
And who wants to be old?

14:30.089 --> 14:31.990
Okay, everyone needs to calm down.

14:32.024 --> 14:33.291
Just because Danny and Amy made a mistake

14:33.326 --> 14:35.193
doesn't mean their lives are over.

14:35.227 --> 14:36.962
I mean, look at Emma.

14:36.996 --> 14:39.998
Some people... including at
least one mother in this room...

14:40.032 --> 14:41.333
thought I shouldn't even keep her,

14:41.367 --> 14:43.034
but she's turned out
to be the greatest thing

14:43.069 --> 14:44.135
that's ever happened to me.

14:44.170 --> 14:46.304
Honey, I don't think an unplanned child

14:46.339 --> 14:49.307
is the inspirational story you think it is.

14:49.342 --> 14:52.410
Maybe not for Danny and Amy,

14:52.445 --> 14:56.047
but maybe for Riley.

14:56.082 --> 14:58.383
Wait, Riley's pregnant too?!

15:00.019 --> 15:02.287
What, did you all make some sort of pact?!

15:16.402 --> 15:20.171
So you really thought this
was the best place to meet?

15:20.206 --> 15:23.408
Sir, I'm not really sure what to say here.

15:23.442 --> 15:25.076
I just wish that you could understand

15:25.111 --> 15:26.344
that Amy really is the only girl for me.

15:28.147 --> 15:29.947
Welcome to brat's and biers

15:29.982 --> 15:31.416
where the bratwursts are the brat-best.

15:31.450 --> 15:33.985
They make me say that.

15:34.020 --> 15:35.020
Riley?

15:35.054 --> 15:37.155
Danny? What are you doing here?

15:37.189 --> 15:39.057
What are you doing here?

15:39.091 --> 15:40.425
Well, you'd know if you weren't so busy

15:40.459 --> 15:43.328
trying to impress Amy's
stick-in-the-mud dad.

15:43.362 --> 15:44.329
That's him right there, isn't it?

15:45.998 --> 15:47.132
Sorry.

15:47.166 --> 15:48.433
Now, if you'll excuse me,

15:48.467 --> 15:50.368
I have to go sing Happy Gluckwunscht

15:50.403 --> 15:52.337
to someone at table eight.

15:54.140 --> 15:55.273
So...

15:55.307 --> 15:57.275
Any chance we could
ignore what just happened

15:57.309 --> 15:59.177
and get back to my plan to impress you?

15:59.211 --> 16:00.345
I'm gonna go with no.

16:02.081 --> 16:04.082
- Oh, Danny, hey.
- Ben, kind of

16:04.116 --> 16:05.250
in the middle of something here.

16:05.284 --> 16:07.185
Oh, you must be Amy's dad.

16:07.219 --> 16:10.088
For the record, we make really cute babies.

16:11.323 --> 16:13.925
Isn't this place amazing?

16:13.959 --> 16:16.261
I mean free hats, beer, giant pretzels!

16:16.295 --> 16:19.264
Is that an oompah band?

16:19.298 --> 16:20.331
Don't wait up.

16:20.366 --> 16:23.334
Have you seen Riley? Oh, there she is.

16:23.369 --> 16:25.203
Thanks.

16:25.237 --> 16:27.105
Any chance we could ignore that too.

16:27.139 --> 16:28.239
Still no.

16:30.976 --> 16:32.110
Fraulein.

16:32.144 --> 16:33.144
Ben,

16:33.179 --> 16:34.279
what are you doing here?

16:34.313 --> 16:37.148
I just wanted to tell you
I'm not gonna let you do it.

16:37.183 --> 16:38.383
Riley, this isn't you.

16:40.052 --> 16:41.352
I'm not gonna let you throw your life away.

16:41.387 --> 16:44.021
I don't know what I'm doing with my life.

16:44.056 --> 16:45.223
I just know that I can't go back in there

16:45.257 --> 16:46.224
and take that test again.

16:46.258 --> 16:48.126
But you have to.

16:48.160 --> 16:50.161
You have to face your fears.

16:50.196 --> 16:51.329
I mean, look at me.

16:51.363 --> 16:53.364
My biggest fear was becoming a daddy.

16:53.399 --> 16:56.401
And now I can't imagine being anything but.

16:56.435 --> 16:59.170
I don't know.

16:59.205 --> 17:00.972
What if I mess up again?

17:01.006 --> 17:02.974
Then you'll take it again.

17:03.008 --> 17:05.143
Being a lawyer is your dream.

17:05.176 --> 17:07.212
I can't talk about this right now.

17:07.246 --> 17:08.945
Riley, come on.

17:13.018 --> 17:14.919
Uh, excuse me.

17:14.953 --> 17:16.954
Can I just have everyone's
attention for a second.

17:20.159 --> 17:22.227
It's just like riding a bike, man.

17:22.261 --> 17:24.194
I knew those lessons would come in handy.

17:26.397 --> 17:28.266
I just need to take a quick survey.

17:28.300 --> 17:31.136
Who here has failed at something?

17:31.170 --> 17:32.970
Well,

17:33.005 --> 17:35.340
clearly some of you are
failing at being honest.

17:35.374 --> 17:37.074
Come on, guys,

17:37.109 --> 17:38.075
I'm trying to help out a friend here.

17:40.179 --> 17:41.146
Thank you.

17:41.180 --> 17:43.181
Thank you.

17:43.215 --> 17:47.418
Now who here has ever had a
dream that they gave up on?

17:49.455 --> 17:53.224
And who here regrets
not pursuing that dream?

17:54.393 --> 17:56.994
I'm sorry, I'm living my dream right now.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.067
I am so sorry.

18:03.101 --> 18:05.270
Shh.

18:09.041 --> 18:12.277
Everybody screws up.

18:12.311 --> 18:14.912
It's what you do about it that counts.

18:16.315 --> 18:17.982
I mean, look at my brother

18:18.016 --> 18:19.184
over there.

18:19.218 --> 18:21.052
Sure, he might have
knocked up his girlfriend,

18:21.086 --> 18:22.220
but you don't see him running away.

18:22.254 --> 18:24.021
- Ben!
- Amy's pregnant?!

18:25.123 --> 18:27.325
Oh, sorry, dude.

18:27.359 --> 18:29.126
I thought that's what you
guys were talking about.

18:31.029 --> 18:32.163
Thank you for your time.

18:32.198 --> 18:33.198
Tucker, take it away.

18:35.267 --> 18:38.169
Eins, zwei, drei, vier...

18:42.208 --> 18:43.208
Thank you.

18:48.380 --> 18:49.947
I should have known.

18:49.981 --> 18:51.249
See, this is exactly
what I was worried about

18:51.283 --> 18:52.250
with a guy like you.

18:52.284 --> 18:54.051
Stay away from Amy!

18:54.086 --> 18:55.986
What's going on?

18:56.021 --> 18:57.422
Amy, are you all right?

18:57.456 --> 19:01.058
I just want you to know
that no matter what happens,

19:01.093 --> 19:02.893
I'm here for you.

19:02.928 --> 19:04.229
You're not in this alone.

19:04.263 --> 19:07.064
We're truly in this together.

19:07.099 --> 19:09.934
It's okay.

19:09.968 --> 19:11.135
I'm not pregnant.

19:11.169 --> 19:12.970
Oh, thank God!

19:13.004 --> 19:16.006
Whoo!

19:16.041 --> 19:18.075
Sorry, didn't mean to blurt that out,

19:18.110 --> 19:19.310
but it's exactly what I was thinking.

19:19.345 --> 19:21.178
Don't worry.

19:21.213 --> 19:23.381
I was relieved too.

19:23.415 --> 19:27.184
And it is really nice to know

19:27.219 --> 19:28.953
that you would be there for me.

19:28.987 --> 19:30.187
Always.

19:30.222 --> 19:32.390
Thank you.

19:37.162 --> 19:38.296
Daddy, I'm sorry.

19:38.330 --> 19:41.098
I know you must be really disappointed.

19:41.133 --> 19:45.069
Only in myself...

19:45.103 --> 19:46.271
for ever doubting that you wouldn't be able

19:46.305 --> 19:48.172
to pick out the right guy for you.

19:48.206 --> 19:51.142
So you like me?

19:51.176 --> 19:53.144
It ain't a no.

19:55.247 --> 19:56.213
All right.

19:56.248 --> 19:57.982
Ready for round two...

19:58.016 --> 19:59.984
or four actually.

20:00.018 --> 20:01.386
Not quite yet.

20:01.420 --> 20:03.053
What's that?

20:03.088 --> 20:05.323
It's your emergency don't-freak-out kit.

20:05.357 --> 20:08.058
Tea to calm you down.

20:08.093 --> 20:10.194
Espresso to wake you up.

20:11.430 --> 20:13.197
A photo of Emma because, well,

20:13.231 --> 20:14.332
who doesn't want a photo of Emma?

20:16.201 --> 20:17.335
And last but not least,

20:17.369 --> 20:20.271
note cards to remind
you how amazing you are.

20:22.073 --> 20:23.341
You're amazing.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.276
You're an incredible friend.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.044
Thank you.

20:27.078 --> 20:29.013
I just want you to know

20:29.047 --> 20:30.247
that you have more than
one Wheeler in your corner.

20:33.185 --> 20:34.452
I think I always knew that.

20:37.022 --> 20:38.122
So on the friend scale, seriously,

20:38.156 --> 20:40.090
- where would you put me?
- Oh, God.

20:40.125 --> 20:41.392
And remember, it's out of seven.

20:47.023 --> 20:48.091
I hear fourth time's a charm!

20:48.092 --> 20:49.597
So, how do you thing you did?

20:49.598 --> 20:51.435
- I don't know...
- Riley!

20:51.436 --> 20:52.694
Ok, ok.

20:52.695 --> 20:55.312
- Nailed it!
- Whoo! Yeah!

20:55.847 --> 20:57.901
Welcome to Brat and Biers,

20:57.902 --> 21:00.152
where our bratwurst is the brat-best.

21:00.853 --> 21:02.224
I can't believe I get to say that.

21:04.625 --> 21:05.450
Boys.
