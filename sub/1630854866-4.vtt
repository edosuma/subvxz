15:33.900 --> 15:36.260
I'm sure it won't take long.

[quiet chatter]

16:15.720 --> 16:17.680
[sniffs]

16:24.730 --> 16:26.670
[Leonora] So, how was it?

16:26.870 --> 16:29.610
The dignity of honest toil?

16:32.900 --> 16:34.310
I'm rather sore.

16:34.510 --> 16:36.560
But you did it.

16:36.760 --> 16:39.520
A day's work,
all for yourself.

16:39.720 --> 16:42.110
I was under the impression
I was working for you.

16:42.310 --> 16:45.250
Nobody works
for anyone else here.

16:51.840 --> 16:55.240
And what we produce,
we own... all of us.

16:55.440 --> 16:57.910
What on earth would I want
with so many rifles?

16:58.110 --> 17:00.080
Well, you might want them
if you ever have

17:00.280 --> 17:02.480
to face down the Pact army.

17:05.020 --> 17:09.420
Would it surprise you to know
that I have a human mate?

17:09.620 --> 17:11.640
I'd like to say it wouldn't,

17:11.830 --> 17:14.350
given my situation.

17:14.550 --> 17:16.950
But, in all honesty, yes.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.440
The prejudices
I was raised with...

17:24.640 --> 17:26.400
I'm sometimes afraid
I'll never shed them entirely.

17:26.600 --> 17:28.780
[Leonora] Revolution.

17:28.980 --> 17:32.280
It starts in the head
and in the heart.

17:32.480 --> 17:34.740
It's always harder
than you think.

17:34.940 --> 17:36.740
Yes, it is, isn't it?

17:36.940 --> 17:39.540
I love Agreus,

17:39.740 --> 17:41.830
but I still struggle
to accustom myself

17:42.030 --> 17:44.040
to the general idea
of human and fae together.

17:44.240 --> 17:46.420
I'm not proud of it.

17:46.620 --> 17:50.550
But... I thought perhaps
it would get easier.

17:50.750 --> 17:53.490
Or that you would get stronger.

17:54.650 --> 17:57.810
You will, <i>ziska,</i> I promise.

17:58.010 --> 18:01.350
When I first fell in love
with Tomás,

18:01.550 --> 18:03.810
I prayed for acceptance.

18:04.010 --> 18:07.020
But before that,
I prayed for patience.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.360
Patience?

18:08.560 --> 18:10.990
For his feet.

18:11.190 --> 18:12.400
His feet?

18:12.600 --> 18:14.530
His hideous, bony feet.

18:14.730 --> 18:18.950
Like deformed hands
where his hooves should be.

18:19.150 --> 18:20.790
I tried my best.

18:20.990 --> 18:22.710
We both did.

18:22.910 --> 18:26.100
He wouldn't touch my hooves
for ages.

18:28.100 --> 18:31.420
They are... an acquired taste.

18:31.620 --> 18:33.270
[laughing]

18:34.650 --> 18:36.990
[both laugh]

18:39.530 --> 18:42.100
If they had found Tomás and I

18:42.300 --> 18:45.190
together in the Pact,
I would have been executed.

18:45.390 --> 18:47.810
And my horns mounted

18:48.010 --> 18:50.250
on a wall as a warning.
Did you know that?

18:51.290 --> 18:53.700
He would have
been reprimanded,

18:53.900 --> 18:57.740
sure that he had fallen under
the spell of a Puck temptress.

18:57.940 --> 19:01.080
As if I had such power.

19:01.280 --> 19:03.760
Is it that way in the Burgue?

19:06.390 --> 19:08.630
I don't know.

19:08.830 --> 19:12.510
We left before
we were... were found out.

19:12.710 --> 19:16.380
Here you are free, Imogen.

19:16.580 --> 19:18.760
You and Agreus.

19:18.960 --> 19:21.930
Here and nowhere else
in the world.

19:22.130 --> 19:26.100
Your sheets may not be
so fine, but you are

19:26.300 --> 19:28.650
free to love as you will.

19:28.850 --> 19:30.870
Do you see that?

19:34.710 --> 19:36.530
Good.

19:36.730 --> 19:39.830
And don't worry.
If I can get used to feet,

19:40.020 --> 19:42.450
you can get used to hooves.

19:42.650 --> 19:46.060
But his stubbornness,
that you should worry about.

19:48.060 --> 19:50.590
He seems no more stubborn
than any man.

19:50.790 --> 19:54.170
What we have built here
is a fragile idea:

19:54.370 --> 19:58.510
human and fae, men and women
working together as equals.

19:58.710 --> 20:00.390
Our enemies abound.

20:00.590 --> 20:03.430
We cannot have them
amongst us, too.

20:03.630 --> 20:08.440
If Agreus continues to resist,
I fear for him.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.410
For both of you.

20:13.750 --> 20:15.440
I understand.

20:15.640 --> 20:17.590

20:38.650 --> 20:40.340
When should I expect Imogen?

20:40.540 --> 20:43.740
You'll have to ask Leonora
about that.

20:45.410 --> 20:47.700
Good night, Comrade.

20:50.870 --> 20:54.150
- Kastor.
- Yes, Comrade?

20:54.350 --> 20:56.400
What became of Madam Hannah?

I'm sorry?

Her bedroll, her things,
they're gone. Where is she?

I'm afraid I don't know
who you're talking about.

21:04.900 --> 21:06.620
Madam Hannah.

21:06.820 --> 21:08.160
She slept in
the hallway last night

21:08.360 --> 21:11.370
and you spoke with her
just this morning.

21:11.570 --> 21:13.210
Where is she?

21:13.410 --> 21:17.840
Such a person does not exist
and never has.

21:18.040 --> 21:21.300
So no one should
ever speak of her again.

21:46.630 --> 21:48.750
Actually, we found we have

- Did you?
- Yes.

21:51.410 --> 21:53.120
Speaking to her,
you would not know

21:53.320 --> 21:56.630
she was the leader
of the revolution.

21:56.830 --> 21:58.840
She's just an ordinary person.

21:59.040 --> 22:01.150
But she's not ordinary.

22:03.070 --> 22:06.810
She's the commander

22:09.920 --> 22:12.520
I suppose she does.

22:12.720 --> 22:14.810
My love, maybe we've been
rather too hasty

22:15.010 --> 22:16.190
in our judgement of this place.

22:16.390 --> 22:19.690
Hasty? I think not.

This is the only place anywhere

could be together, and no one
would give it a second thought.

22:30.470 --> 22:32.660
Maybe we should consider
Leonora's invitation to stay.

Invitation?

22:34.490 --> 22:36.850
Invitations can be refused.

it will not be as dangerous
as where we are right now.

You have convinced my general

is buying Burguish rifles

to use against us.

25:39.880 --> 25:41.770
Why would I believe
such a report?

44:51.940 --> 44:54.060
Guess I should say well done.

44:57.190 --> 44:59.930
Police know it was you.

45:00.130 --> 45:01.600
You need to run.

45:01.790 --> 45:03.600
Run where, exactly?

45:03.800 --> 45:05.370
Back to Tirnanoc?

45:06.910 --> 45:09.100
I can get you out
till things calm down.

45:09.300 --> 45:11.100
Find a place that will
be safer for you.

45:11.300 --> 45:13.110
You picked sides
against the fae,

45:13.310 --> 45:14.400
and everyone here knows it.

45:14.600 --> 45:16.900
I'm not the one
that needs to run.

45:17.100 --> 45:19.240
I'll be fine.

45:19.440 --> 45:22.160
There's a nest full of Raven
who'll say different.

45:22.360 --> 45:25.410
And there's nothing I can do
to protect you.

45:25.610 --> 45:27.640
If you have a way out, use it.

45:32.810 --> 45:34.350
I'm not going anywhere.

45:36.150 --> 45:40.130
Well, cheers to that.

45:40.330 --> 45:41.840
[glasses clink]

45:42.040 --> 45:43.820
[Philo exhales sharply]

45:45.410 --> 45:47.640
Fuck. [chuckles]

45:47.840 --> 45:49.450
Yeah.

45:50.620 --> 45:53.480
A fine couple we make, eh?

45:53.680 --> 45:57.030
We did, for a time.

45:57.230 --> 46:00.000
And it was good fun
fooling ourselves.

46:03.550 --> 46:06.430
Yeah. It was.

46:12.930 --> 46:16.060
[police whistles blowing]

46:17.440 --> 46:19.880
[Boz] The fuckin coppers
are here! Run!

46:20.080 --> 46:21.760
[panicked shouting]

46:21.960 --> 46:23.970
[officer] Where the fuck
are those Black Raven hiding?!

46:24.170 --> 46:25.350
[Vignette] They're gonna
kill us all.

46:25.550 --> 46:27.180
- I have to warn them.
- No, I'll warn 'em.

46:27.380 --> 46:30.180
You shouldn't go.
Don't go!

46:30.380 --> 46:31.980
[panicked shouting continues]

46:32.180 --> 46:35.750
Hurry. Hurry!
Best not get in their way.

46:37.670 --> 46:39.280
Get the fuck off him.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.280
Dombey.

46:40.480 --> 46:43.030
What the fuck is this?

46:43.230 --> 46:45.450
[Thatch] You!
Where are the Black Raven?

46:45.650 --> 46:46.450
Please don't hurt us.

46:46.650 --> 46:47.620
No need to if you tell

46:47.820 --> 46:48.990
- me where they are.
- I don't know.

46:49.190 --> 46:51.290
You tell me
where the fuck they are!

46:51.490 --> 46:53.370
They're over there.
Don't hurt us.

46:53.570 --> 46:55.790
- You're gonna tell me now...
- They're over there.

46:55.990 --> 46:57.340
[grunts] Fuck off!

46:57.540 --> 46:58.590
- [Philo] Go on!
- [Thatch] They're
over this way!

46:58.790 --> 46:59.800
This way!

47:00.000 --> 47:02.220
[women crying out]

47:02.420 --> 47:04.820
- [Thatch] Come on, boys.
- [police whistles blowing]

47:07.320 --> 47:09.110
[screaming, shouting]

47:22.090 --> 47:23.710
[gunshots]

47:27.550 --> 47:29.300
[crowd screaming]

47:30.590 --> 47:31.720
[cries out]

47:37.680 --> 47:39.850
[grunting]

47:41.650 --> 47:43.650
[gunfire continues]

47:45.110 --> 47:46.590
Stop shooting!

47:46.790 --> 47:48.280
I am the one you want.

47:49.900 --> 47:53.480
I went to the Burgue to get
the copper who killed Oona.

47:53.670 --> 47:55.240
Is this the one?

47:59.000 --> 48:01.080
She doesn't deserve
a clean death.

48:03.170 --> 48:05.090
Save her for the Hydra.
