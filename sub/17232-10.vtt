WEBVTT

00:01.718 --> 00:03.086
Previously on "Nashville"...

00:03.087 --> 00:06.661
An arena tour. You
co-headlining with Juliette.

00:06.662 --> 00:07.921
We want you to hit the road with us

00:07.922 --> 00:09.506
when we head back out. Seriously?

00:09.507 --> 00:12.233
Peggy Kenter overdosed on sleeping pills.

00:12.234 --> 00:12.943
She what?

00:12.943 --> 00:14.822
You had an affair with her, right? No.

00:14.823 --> 00:17.161
Dominic wants to sign me as a solo artist.

00:17.162 --> 00:18.758
What'd he say when you
told him to screw off?

00:18.759 --> 00:19.890
I didn't.

00:19.904 --> 00:23.710
♪Let me tell you something, my dear♪

00:23.711 --> 00:26.214
Before word of this crazy
elopement gets out,

00:26.215 --> 00:27.883
I want this marriage done right.

00:27.884 --> 00:31.717
♪Love like mine♪

00:38.442 --> 00:40.349
This tour came together really quickly.

00:40.350 --> 00:43.849
Are you ready to play for
30,000 fans tomorrow night?

00:43.871 --> 00:44.813
Oh, you bet.

00:44.814 --> 00:46.063
We've spent the last two weeks

00:46.064 --> 00:47.958
doing some really great smaller shows

00:47.959 --> 00:49.987
in Tucson and San Antonio,

00:49.988 --> 00:52.204
Oklahoma city, Albuquerque...
that was a great one.

00:52.205 --> 00:53.745
I feel like we've got it down pat.

00:53.746 --> 00:54.789
Yeah. We really do,

00:54.790 --> 00:56.513
and we're just excited to give our fans

00:56.514 --> 00:58.342
in San Diego one hell of a show.

00:58.343 --> 00:59.741
So they don't need to worry

00:59.742 --> 01:01.713
that you'll run off at the last minute

01:01.714 --> 01:03.099
and leave them high and dry?

01:03.369 --> 01:05.294
That's funny. No, they don't.

01:05.295 --> 01:06.897
And if your next question's gonna be

01:06.898 --> 01:08.698
asking me why I didn't
make it down the aisle,

01:08.699 --> 01:09.727
then you know I'm gonna tell you

01:09.728 --> 01:11.633
what I've been telling everybody else...

01:11.634 --> 01:13.618
they're called "personal
matters" for a reason.

01:13.619 --> 01:15.073
Rayna, this is your first tour ever

01:15.074 --> 01:17.885
without your long-time
guitarist Deacon Claybourne.

01:17.886 --> 01:19.561
Has it been much of an adjustment?

01:19.562 --> 01:22.961
Well, you know, uh, change
is always challenging,

01:22.962 --> 01:26.154
but we've got such a
wonderful crew on this tour.

01:26.155 --> 01:27.997
I think my fans are gonna get

01:27.998 --> 01:30.281
the best Rayna Jaymes
show they've ever seen.

01:30.328 --> 01:32.160
It'll be the first one for most of mine.

01:35.654 --> 01:36.595
Next question.

01:36.596 --> 01:39.230
Xxx

01:39.333 --> 01:41.431
Rayna! Rayna! Juliette!

01:44.423 --> 01:45.637
You get everything you need?

01:45.638 --> 01:46.576
Yeah.

01:47.158 --> 01:49.585
Well, maybe not everything.

01:55.112 --> 01:57.485
I'm gonna catch a break when
I turn this article in.

01:57.486 --> 01:59.318
I can meet back up with you for a while.

01:59.547 --> 02:00.978
I don't know. Just, you know,

02:00.979 --> 02:02.631
still getting used to the
crew and everything.

02:02.632 --> 02:04.609
Same old Deacon.

02:04.936 --> 02:07.122
Just promise me that you'll
be kind to yourself?

02:10.854 --> 02:13.035
Hey, uh, you got everything
you need from me?

02:13.036 --> 02:13.985
Yeah. Pretty much.

02:13.986 --> 02:15.713
Well, what if I wanna do a follow-up?

02:15.714 --> 02:17.592
I don't know. Just... call me.

02:17.593 --> 02:18.518
Will you sign my picture, too?

02:18.519 --> 02:21.153
Yeah. All right. This is
the last one right here.

02:21.187 --> 02:23.199
Hey, I wouldn't let it
go to your head, Deac.

02:24.006 --> 02:25.594
I didn't even try. That's funny, Cy,

02:25.595 --> 02:27.461
'cause it looked like you tried real hard.

02:29.000 --> 02:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:42.411 --> 02:44.139
Juliette's sound check is tomorrow at 4:00,

02:44.140 --> 02:46.439
and you're at 5:00. Okay.

02:46.798 --> 02:47.879
Everything okay?

02:47.917 --> 02:49.038
Yeah, you know, it'd good.

02:49.039 --> 02:50.802
I love this crew, I love all these guys,

02:50.803 --> 02:53.152
but this guitar player... I
don't know what he's doing.

02:53.153 --> 02:54.762
Well, I mean, he comes highly recommended.

02:54.763 --> 02:56.502
He toured with Brad and Keith.

02:57.370 --> 02:58.741
Maybe that's the problem.

02:58.763 --> 02:59.889
He doesn't seem to have any interest

02:59.890 --> 03:00.712
in what we're doing here.

03:00.713 --> 03:02.530
He's... he's off doing his own thing.

03:02.985 --> 03:03.694
You want me to talk to him?

03:03.695 --> 03:05.482
Would you? That'd be great.

03:06.335 --> 03:08.086
Hey, girls!

03:08.087 --> 03:09.317
What's up?

03:09.318 --> 03:10.369
Hey, mom. Hi, mom.

03:10.370 --> 03:11.654
Guess where I am?

03:11.655 --> 03:12.737
Where?

03:15.639 --> 03:17.575
Are you nervous? I'd be so nervous.

03:17.576 --> 03:20.157
Naw. This isn't my first rodeo.

03:20.158 --> 03:22.285
Anyway, I know that if I
fall flat on my face,

03:22.286 --> 03:23.243
I have you to come home to.

03:23.244 --> 03:25.477
Hey, hey, hey, hey. Hat's going on here?

03:25.478 --> 03:26.703
I told you you can call mom later.

03:26.704 --> 03:27.980
You got homework to do. Come on.

03:27.981 --> 03:29.197
Dad. Dad.

03:29.198 --> 03:30.932
Come on. No. Y'all go, okay?

03:30.933 --> 03:32.021
Listen to your dad.

03:32.022 --> 03:35.070
And I love you so much. I love you.
I miss you. Mwah!

03:35.071 --> 03:36.657
Love you, too. Love you. Miss you.

03:36.658 --> 03:38.604
Let's go. Let's go. Here.

03:39.458 --> 03:41.247
Thanks, girls. Hey, hang on.

03:41.248 --> 03:42.777
I'm gonna take it off video.

03:42.997 --> 03:44.177
Oh. Okay.

03:44.965 --> 03:46.240
All right. I'm back.

03:46.454 --> 03:48.449
Hey. How are they doing?

03:48.450 --> 03:49.757
They're doing fine.

03:49.923 --> 03:51.148
How are you doing?

03:51.714 --> 03:52.595
How are the polls?

03:52.596 --> 03:54.536
Well, a little too close
to call at this point.

03:54.537 --> 03:56.819
How are you? Or...

03:56.857 --> 03:58.483
I guess maybe how are we?

03:59.242 --> 04:01.057
Have you given it more thought?

04:01.975 --> 04:03.389
Yeah. You know, I... you know,

04:03.390 --> 04:06.647
I haven't really had a
lot of chance to process

04:06.749 --> 04:07.968
'cause I'm trying to put together

04:07.969 --> 04:10.188
this gigantic arena tour

04:10.418 --> 04:11.366
in no time.

04:11.367 --> 04:13.266
So you're not coming back for the election?

04:13.991 --> 04:14.594
I didn't say that.

04:14.595 --> 04:16.334
No, no, look, Rayna, I get it.

04:16.334 --> 04:17.560
You have to work.

04:17.773 --> 04:20.062
It would only be for
appearance's sake anyway.

04:20.063 --> 04:21.084
Teddy, that's not true.

04:21.084 --> 04:22.029
Look, I gotta go.

04:22.031 --> 04:23.962
I gotta get to the campaign office.

04:34.181 --> 04:35.654
Xxx

04:37.330 --> 04:39.370
you still thinking of driving
to Austin after work?

04:40.143 --> 04:42.481
Uh, I am, yeah.

04:43.223 --> 04:43.983
Well...

04:43.984 --> 04:45.894
The revel kings are playing
there tomorrow night,

04:45.895 --> 04:47.856
and Deacon got us tickets.

04:49.431 --> 04:50.764
That is nice.

04:50.765 --> 04:51.865
It'll be really cool.

04:51.866 --> 04:53.301
Backstage passes, front-row seats,

04:53.302 --> 04:54.593
we get to meet the band.

04:54.934 --> 04:55.905
Be fun.

04:57.334 --> 05:00.143
Yeah, but, uh, I've got...

05:00.373 --> 05:02.624
Family stuff I have to deal with, so...

05:03.463 --> 05:04.702
Okay, well, would it be all right

05:04.703 --> 05:06.572
if I just hitched a ride
and chipped in for gas?

05:06.573 --> 05:08.685
I mean, we could turn
it into a working trip.

05:08.686 --> 05:10.622
15 hours of writing music.

05:11.470 --> 05:13.287
Yeah. I-I don't know. Um...

05:13.288 --> 05:15.730
Are you all right?
You're... you're kind of weird.

05:15.814 --> 05:17.407
I'm not. I'm...

05:17.408 --> 05:19.614
Well, clearly, you don't
enjoy my company, then.

05:19.615 --> 05:20.585
That's fine.

05:21.390 --> 05:24.136
Trouble is, I-I gotta
leave from here, so...

05:24.702 --> 05:26.552
Well, luckily, I brought my bag.

05:32.877 --> 05:35.119
I don't understand why
you're having me sign these.

05:35.120 --> 05:37.896
People don't buy CDs anymore, okay?

05:38.287 --> 05:39.340
That was your lawyer.

05:39.858 --> 05:41.852
Sean still hasn't signed
the divorce papers.

05:41.953 --> 05:43.308
Are you serious?

05:43.571 --> 05:44.950
Wait, does he not understand

05:44.951 --> 05:46.404
that the longer we wait to end this,

05:46.405 --> 05:47.606
the more time the press has

05:47.607 --> 05:49.326
to figure out we're actually married?

05:49.327 --> 05:51.063
Maybe you should ask him that yourself.

05:52.526 --> 05:53.097
I'm just saying,

05:53.098 --> 05:54.852
it might help if you reached out to him.

05:55.655 --> 05:57.586
I'm pretty sure I'm the last person

05:57.587 --> 05:59.261
he wants to hear from.

06:04.002 --> 06:05.085
Come in.

06:06.447 --> 06:07.367
Hey.

06:08.894 --> 06:10.120
Thanks for coming in.

06:10.475 --> 06:14.734
Um, uh, I just wanted to talk
to you about if you would

06:14.735 --> 06:17.026
really just, you know, play the changes.

06:17.027 --> 06:19.262
Bucky already talked to me about it. Okay.

06:19.363 --> 06:20.069
Anything else?

06:20.070 --> 06:23.780
Well, you know, if you would...
if you would sing with me.

06:23.781 --> 06:24.725
Sometimes it feels like

06:24.726 --> 06:25.962
I'm ending up having to follow you.

06:25.963 --> 06:28.299
Sure. Sure. Whatever.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.946
Yeah, I want us to feel
like a unit, you know?

06:29.947 --> 06:31.979
I wanna feel like we're
really working together.

06:31.980 --> 06:33.898
Well, that's what I thought I was doing.

06:33.899 --> 06:35.990
You know, with all due respect,

06:36.603 --> 06:37.965
I don't know what the
hell you want from me.

06:37.966 --> 06:40.337
Gosh, I'm trying to figure out how I can

06:40.338 --> 06:42.042
help us to understand each other better.

06:42.043 --> 06:44.405
You see, I think I do understand.

06:44.555 --> 06:46.308
You're impossible to please.

06:47.547 --> 06:48.645
I quit.

06:51.979 --> 06:52.917
What?

06:53.707 --> 06:54.933
What the hell was that?

06:56.653 --> 06:58.970
You, um, you want me to
go talk to him again?

06:58.971 --> 07:00.350
I don't think there's any point.

07:00.351 --> 07:01.822
Well, uh, Rayna, the point is that

07:01.823 --> 07:03.272
we have a tour starting tomorrow night,

07:03.273 --> 07:05.374
and a second guitar player has just quit.

07:05.375 --> 07:06.440
I know.

07:06.899 --> 07:09.225
Can you please go find
me a good guitar player?

07:09.294 --> 07:11.611
Is anyone I find you gonna be good enough?

<font color="#40bfff">www.Addic7ed.com</font>

07:31.406 --> 07:33.124
All right, the election is two days away.

07:33.125 --> 07:35.814
The latest polls have you and Teddy Conrad

07:35.815 --> 07:37.703
in a dead heat, neck and neck.

07:37.704 --> 07:39.287
How do you plan to gain an edge?

07:39.288 --> 07:41.185
There's no doubt about
it... it's gonna be close.

07:41.190 --> 07:43.839
But I will not hide behind the
walls of a gated community.

07:43.840 --> 07:45.497
I'm the candidate who
interacts with voters,

07:45.498 --> 07:47.555
and I'm gonna be out here
asking for your vote.

07:48.474 --> 07:49.561
If he's pounding the payment,

07:49.562 --> 07:51.078
it just means he's run out of cash.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.681
Our campaign raised twice as much.

07:52.682 --> 07:55.415
The fact is, Coleman
Carlisle is a known quantity

07:55.416 --> 07:57.312
from years of holding public office.

07:57.313 --> 07:58.881
That can be enough for undecided voters.

07:58.882 --> 08:00.413
Conrad may have been a household name

08:00.414 --> 08:03.464
around here for 30 years,
but it's not anymore.

08:03.934 --> 08:05.395
And even then, your great-grandfather

08:05.396 --> 08:06.507
only became a senator

08:06.508 --> 08:09.270
by taking certain measures
into his own hands.

08:11.292 --> 08:12.275
Absolutely not.

08:12.276 --> 08:14.853
Teddy, you've already
sacrificed so much for this.

08:14.854 --> 08:16.365
A lot of people are
counting on you, Teddy...

08:16.366 --> 08:18.489
your contributors, your supporters...
okay, I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

08:18.490 --> 08:20.210
But I would rather lose this race

08:20.211 --> 08:22.029
than win it on bought votes.

08:22.131 --> 08:24.269
And yes, I have sacrificed a lot.

08:24.674 --> 08:27.101
I don't intend to squander what's left.

08:40.030 --> 08:43.433
Hey, did, uh, Dominic
ever send the contract?

08:44.443 --> 08:46.009
You wanna talk shop now?

08:46.273 --> 08:47.450
Yeah. Why not?

08:51.522 --> 08:52.745
He did.

08:54.744 --> 08:56.150
And you didn't tell me because...

08:56.151 --> 08:59.205
It was a lousy deal. Went
over it with my lawyer.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.906
He's offering a 9% royalty rate.

09:01.930 --> 09:03.342
Which is pretty standard, right?

09:03.343 --> 09:05.129
Not for someone with your talent.

09:05.742 --> 09:06.934
Plus he's added deductions

09:06.935 --> 09:09.776
that effectively reduce
it to a fraction of that.

09:09.814 --> 09:12.879
You wouldn't see a penny from
record sales for a long time.

09:13.781 --> 09:15.680
You sure your lawyer's any good?

09:16.470 --> 09:19.215
I mean, why would Dominic
try to pull a fast one?

09:21.526 --> 09:23.873
Because he knows he can
screw someone like you.

09:23.975 --> 09:24.886
Like me?

09:24.887 --> 09:25.888
Yes.

09:27.750 --> 09:30.793
Young. Inexperienced.

09:30.794 --> 09:31.860
Right.

09:33.450 --> 09:35.572
'Course, that's how you like 'em, too.

09:46.131 --> 09:47.516
Guess you got this.

09:47.874 --> 09:49.932
You sure don't wanna just
hang about for a minute?

09:50.163 --> 09:51.295
It's kind of nice.

09:51.296 --> 09:54.171
No, I need to, uh, spend
some time with my brother.

09:54.172 --> 09:56.342
Okay. Is it just your brother here?

09:57.005 --> 09:59.449
Well, we could see if we can
get him a backstage pass, too.

09:59.857 --> 10:00.411
It's okay.

10:00.412 --> 10:02.214
He... he wouldn't be too into it.

10:02.541 --> 10:03.938
Besides, he lives quite a ways from here,

10:03.939 --> 10:05.246
outside of Austin proper.

10:05.247 --> 10:06.681
There she is. Hi!

10:06.682 --> 10:08.348
I missed you. How are you?

10:08.349 --> 10:10.010
I'm good. How you doin', gun?

10:10.011 --> 10:12.245
You're doing better. Nice hotel.

10:12.907 --> 10:14.261
Hey, y'all just drive straight on through?

10:14.262 --> 10:14.925
Yeah. Yeah.

10:14.926 --> 10:18.236
But we got three songs out of it, so...
oh, to be young.

10:18.237 --> 10:18.987
Why don't y'all come on inside,

10:18.988 --> 10:19.837
get a bite to eat?

10:19.838 --> 10:21.274
Uh, I can't.

10:22.160 --> 10:24.430
I got family obligations, so...

10:25.248 --> 10:26.674
Hey, I'll pick you up
here same time tomorrow?

10:26.675 --> 10:28.044
Yeah. All right.

10:28.707 --> 10:29.862
Say hi to your brother for me.

10:29.863 --> 10:30.898
I will.

10:31.288 --> 10:32.369
Have fun.

10:32.598 --> 10:33.910
I didn't know he was from Texas.

10:33.911 --> 10:34.949
He is.

10:35.607 --> 10:36.931
Least I think he is.

10:37.719 --> 10:40.417
3 songs and 15 hours later,
you didn't think to ask?

10:46.455 --> 10:47.542
Are you lost?

10:47.543 --> 10:48.593
Hey.

10:50.551 --> 10:52.490
Deacon and I used to come
up to the nosebleeds

10:52.491 --> 10:54.505
before every show. It's kind of a ritual.

10:54.506 --> 10:55.684
To make out?

10:56.142 --> 10:57.385
It's a legitimate question.

10:57.386 --> 10:59.493
No, we came up here to remind ourselves

10:59.494 --> 11:02.756
that people paid good
money for these seats,

11:02.757 --> 11:03.829
even though they weren't ever gonna be

11:03.830 --> 11:04.869
that close to the music.

11:04.870 --> 11:07.248
We wanted to remind ourselves
to play out to 'em.

11:07.399 --> 11:08.774
What are you doing up here?

11:08.775 --> 11:11.185
Your guitar player quit.
You want me to fill in.

11:12.055 --> 11:13.340
Word travels.

11:13.341 --> 11:14.541
The answer's no.

11:14.542 --> 11:16.313
I want somebody who knows me.

11:16.558 --> 11:17.381
You're here.

11:17.382 --> 11:19.563
To record, not to perform.

11:19.564 --> 11:21.938
If I were, it wouldn't
be to do your old stuff.

11:21.939 --> 11:23.225
As you recall, that's why I didn't want

11:23.226 --> 11:24.425
to work with you in the first place.

11:24.426 --> 11:25.684
If you could just help me out

11:25.685 --> 11:27.193
with maybe the first few shows,

11:27.194 --> 11:29.254
just until I can scare up somebody else?

11:31.131 --> 11:33.625
A few means three. All right?
Ask me for four,

11:33.626 --> 11:35.143
and I'm gone and I'm not coming back,

11:35.144 --> 11:36.033
album or no album.

11:36.034 --> 11:39.169
I would never ask you for four.
Four's too many.

11:40.658 --> 11:41.772
Never.

11:50.124 --> 11:51.942
Hi. I'm here with Juliette Barnes

11:51.943 --> 11:55.125
in San Diego for the red
lips and white lies tour.

11:55.126 --> 11:56.490
Hello. How are you?

11:56.491 --> 11:58.273
I'm fantastic. So, Juliette,

11:58.274 --> 12:01.146
are you running the stairs to
work off that nervous energy

12:01.147 --> 12:02.963
for the show or just to stay in shape?

12:02.964 --> 12:04.048
To stay in shape.

12:04.049 --> 12:06.879
It's all part of my routine
when I'm out on the road.

12:06.880 --> 12:09.249
And how do you mentally prepare for a show,

12:09.250 --> 12:12.582
particularly after your
highly publicized split

12:12.583 --> 12:14.208
from Sean Butler? Okay, whoa...

12:14.209 --> 12:16.234
we agreed that topic was off-limits.

12:16.545 --> 12:19.275
You know, actually, I
would like to elaborate.

12:19.649 --> 12:20.966
I know a lot of folks are wondering

12:20.967 --> 12:22.209
what happened between us,

12:22.210 --> 12:25.449
and I just wanna say that
Sean is a wonderful man,

12:25.450 --> 12:27.194
and I think he would agree with me

12:27.195 --> 12:29.780
that it's better to learn
from your mistakes

12:29.782 --> 12:31.237
before you make bigger ones.

12:31.238 --> 12:32.496
That's the nearest thing to an apology

12:32.497 --> 12:33.987
I've ever heard coming from her.

12:33.988 --> 12:35.601
Are you suggesting your
relationship with Sean

12:35.602 --> 12:36.867
was a mistake?

12:36.868 --> 12:39.982
I'm suggesting the idea of marriage was.

12:40.387 --> 12:41.312
I'm gonna get back to it.

12:41.313 --> 12:42.698
It was really good to see you. Okay.

12:42.699 --> 12:43.813
Okay, thank you.

12:44.366 --> 12:46.152
Hey, what the hell was that?

12:46.363 --> 12:48.169
What? You said Sean should hear from me.

12:48.170 --> 12:49.316
Now he will.

12:49.363 --> 12:51.564
Maybe he'll sign the damn divorce papers.

I don't care what he says.

14:33.477 --> 14:36.030

can't just be erased.

Oh, my God. Did someone die?

14:40.322 --> 14:42.146
What? What's up with all these flowers?

14:42.147 --> 14:44.696
Looks like a hospital in
here or a funeral home.

14:44.697 --> 14:46.512
Or a dressing room before a show.

14:46.513 --> 14:48.593
Nobody sends me flowers when I have a show.

14:48.594 --> 14:50.635
That's 'cause they like me
better than they like you.

14:50.954 --> 14:52.570

Where are the boots?

21:34.630 --> 21:35.481
Didn't work.

21:35.482 --> 21:37.473
Too small? They were broken.

21:37.474 --> 21:38.892
What's wrong with the boots?

21:39.587 --> 21:40.689
I put 'em on,

21:40.690 --> 21:42.699
clicked my heels three times,

21:42.836 --> 21:44.431
and I didn't turn into Deacon.

21:44.551 --> 21:46.490
What? I don't wear cowboy boots.

21:46.491 --> 21:48.005
I don't play like him.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.007
I don't... I don't do anything like him.

21:51.543 --> 21:53.536
Trying to turn me or anybody else into him

21:53.537 --> 21:55.452
is not gonna solve your problem.

21:55.918 --> 21:57.341
Well, what problem is that?

21:57.342 --> 21:59.178
You're scared of being on that stage

21:59.179 --> 22:00.200
and having it feel different

22:00.201 --> 22:02.035
than it did for the past 20 years.

22:02.036 --> 22:03.950
I'm not scared.

22:04.046 --> 22:05.721
You're scared.

22:14.522 --> 22:16.375
{an8}??

22:21.100 --> 22:23.859
Hey! Nice ride.

22:23.860 --> 22:25.388
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Hey, listen, you taking off?

22:25.389 --> 22:27.098
'Cause your assistant said
now was a good time to talk.

22:27.099 --> 22:30.183
Come on. When it comes to
you, I got nothin' but time.

22:30.184 --> 22:32.158
You wanna talk about the contract?

22:32.215 --> 22:33.544
Yeah. Let me guess.

22:33.545 --> 22:35.745
Marilyn said it's a bad deal.

22:35.927 --> 22:38.102
Let me level with you. She's small-town.

22:38.103 --> 22:39.195
Out there in Nashville,

22:39.196 --> 22:41.321
she got a roster of local talent.

22:41.322 --> 22:44.147
She struck gold when she
found you, and guess what.

22:44.148 --> 22:47.176
The more money you make,
the more money she makes.

22:47.177 --> 22:49.942
She's just trying to eat, man. You dig?

22:49.943 --> 22:52.013
I do, yeah. What am I doing here?

22:52.014 --> 22:55.336
I'm investing time, money, talent.

22:55.337 --> 22:58.487
I'm trying to brand you into a big star.

22:58.488 --> 23:00.372
What happens when you become a big star,

23:00.373 --> 23:02.537
you turn around and you leave me?

23:02.538 --> 23:04.989
That's what I'm trying to avoid.
You feel me?

23:04.990 --> 23:06.501
Yeah. You wanna take a ride,

23:06.502 --> 23:07.802
and we'll talk about this thing?
Sure, man, yeah.

23:07.803 --> 23:09.399
All right, man.

23:09.579 --> 23:10.866
No, no, no, no, man.

23:10.867 --> 23:13.450
When it come to my artists,
what's mines is yours,

23:13.451 --> 23:15.857
what's yours is mines... unh!

23:16.418 --> 23:17.089
Are you serious?

23:17.090 --> 23:18.972
Yeah, man, I'm serious.

23:21.762 --> 23:23.823
Don't mess up the leather, though, bruh.

23:23.824 --> 23:25.246
You got it.

23:32.123 --> 23:35.052
That was amazing. You were amazing.

23:35.053 --> 23:36.894
Oh, my goodness. Thank you, sweetie.

23:36.895 --> 23:37.779
I'm just glad you could be here

23:37.780 --> 23:39.733
to be a part of it all. Hey, Deac...

23:39.864 --> 23:42.010
Hey, there's a wheelchair kid over here.

23:42.011 --> 23:43.395
He was hoping you'd sign his guitar.

23:43.396 --> 23:45.348
Sure. Okay, I'll be right back.

23:46.413 --> 23:47.794
Hi. Why don't you come with me in there?

23:47.795 --> 23:49.560
The real party's in there.

23:49.561 --> 23:50.553
Okay. Come on.

23:50.554 --> 23:51.859
I should just wait for Deacon.

23:51.860 --> 23:54.473
No, he'll catch up. Don't worry.
Come on. Let's go.

23:54.474 --> 23:55.880
Thank you.

23:58.631 --> 24:00.127
What do you think?

24:03.344 --> 24:04.711
Oh, those are so beautiful.

24:04.712 --> 24:06.739
Yeah, take a look at those pictures.

24:06.740 --> 24:07.942
They're all Lynn Goldsmith.

24:07.943 --> 24:10.261
No way. Yeah.

24:11.464 --> 24:12.927
Nice, huh?

24:21.130 --> 24:22.569
Hey.

24:22.873 --> 24:25.393
What, did you go from ignoring
me to stalking me now?

24:25.394 --> 24:27.005
Thought you had a big show tonight.

24:27.006 --> 24:28.555
I do. Rayna's opening,

24:28.556 --> 24:30.472
and I can get back in an hour.

24:30.512 --> 24:32.729
You know that it's quicker to get a divorce

24:32.730 --> 24:33.883
than an annulment, right?

24:33.884 --> 24:35.910
I'm in no hurry to give you what you want.

24:35.911 --> 24:38.695
Okay. And I'm in no hurry to
stand in front of a judge

24:38.696 --> 24:40.122
and admit that I committed fraud.

24:40.123 --> 24:41.457
The hell you didn't.

24:41.458 --> 24:43.199
You knew what marriage meant to me.

24:43.200 --> 24:44.829
And you... you just...

24:45.066 --> 24:47.595
You know how bad you
embarrassed my parents?

24:47.596 --> 24:50.153
You broke my little sister's heart.

24:50.392 --> 24:52.907
You still haven't apologized...
for any of it.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.139
Didn't you see my interview?

24:54.140 --> 24:57.745
At least take responsibility
for what you did.

24:57.880 --> 25:00.282
Just sign the divorce papers.

25:00.283 --> 25:01.188
Please.

25:01.189 --> 25:03.708
I only planned on getting married once...

25:04.350 --> 25:05.920
To the right woman.

25:06.450 --> 25:08.152
And it's not you.

25:09.241 --> 25:11.826
I want an annulment.

25:20.278 --> 25:21.051
{an8}??

25:27.833 --> 25:29.773
You know, you clearly...

25:30.489 --> 25:32.768
Got the looks in your family.

25:34.747 --> 25:36.226
I think...

25:36.844 --> 25:37.910
You might have the wrong impression.

25:37.911 --> 25:38.929
Oh, no, no, no.

25:38.930 --> 25:42.115
You're like something I
could have dreamed up. Oh.

25:42.258 --> 25:44.433
Absolutely. Hold on one second there.

25:44.434 --> 25:47.803
Gonna sign this. See where my niece here...

25:49.004 --> 25:51.076
Mm. No, no, no. Okay, please don't do that.

25:51.162 --> 25:53.212
Now hold on one second, guys. Hold on.

26:01.267 --> 26:02.184
Sorry, Deacon.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.370
Honey, honey... do you know how many girls

26:04.371 --> 26:06.235
would love to be where you are right now?

26:06.236 --> 26:08.034
What are you doing, Mike? I work for Cy.

26:08.035 --> 26:10.358
I'm going in there right now.
Can't let you do it.

26:12.108 --> 26:15.052
Coulda been much worse, Cy. Any closer...

26:16.189 --> 26:17.833
That would have been your life!

26:17.834 --> 26:19.364
Are you threatening me?! Yes!

26:19.365 --> 26:22.953
This is my band! You're just visiting!
Visit's over. I quit.

26:22.954 --> 26:25.600
Oh, well, good! 'Cause I'd
have to fire your ass anyway!

26:25.601 --> 26:27.921
Go back to freakin' Nashville! Both of you!

26:27.922 --> 26:30.226
No, no, no, please. Come on.

26:42.082 --> 26:42.860
I'm sorry.

26:42.861 --> 26:45.215
Oh, good. You do know how to apologize.

26:45.216 --> 26:47.087
You can apologize for this afternoon.

26:47.088 --> 26:49.227
Oh, no. You were being rude.

26:49.228 --> 26:50.574
I just called you on it.

26:50.575 --> 26:51.813
I was not being rude.

26:51.814 --> 26:53.318
I was not done with my sound check,

26:53.319 --> 26:55.148
and you were rushing me off the stage.

26:55.149 --> 26:57.840
Oh, that's right. You're never wrong.
I forgot.

26:57.841 --> 26:58.845
You're never responsible

26:58.846 --> 27:01.142
for anything that happens around you.

27:01.883 --> 27:04.241
I have a show to get ready for.

27:09.601 --> 27:11.689
Only place I could find was Chinese.

27:11.690 --> 27:13.676
Like 20 Miles away.

27:14.871 --> 27:16.316
What you been doing while I was gone?

27:16.317 --> 27:17.743
Nothing.

27:21.295 --> 27:22.849
What the hell is wrong with you?

27:22.850 --> 27:24.277
That's a violation of parole.

27:24.278 --> 27:25.992
I mean, what, it's been five hours,

27:25.993 --> 27:27.599
and already you're...

27:30.721 --> 27:31.371
Where's my guitar?

27:31.372 --> 27:33.680
I'm gonna get it back for
you real soon, I promise.

27:33.681 --> 27:35.315
Right now I gotta get outta here.

27:35.316 --> 27:37.044
No! No, you don't!

27:37.045 --> 27:38.778
You'll find yourself back
in prison by tomorrow!

27:38.779 --> 27:39.735
You'd be gone before I got there.

27:39.736 --> 27:40.986
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

27:40.987 --> 27:42.642
It means you left me in that parking lot!

27:42.643 --> 27:44.311
I was 16 years old!

27:44.312 --> 27:47.029
I watched you put a gun
in that clerk's face!

27:47.030 --> 27:48.149
You think a day goes by

27:48.150 --> 27:50.544
that I don't feel guilty for leaving you?

27:51.279 --> 27:53.859
But I'm not the one who
robbed the damn store.

27:56.064 --> 27:58.002
You know one thing I could
never wrap my mind around?

27:58.003 --> 27:58.982
No, gun, what's that?

27:58.983 --> 28:01.353
The same guy who looked after me,

28:01.354 --> 28:03.185
told off anybody who looked at me sideways,

28:03.186 --> 28:04.948
made my lunches...

28:05.391 --> 28:07.210
Taught me how to play guitar...

28:08.945 --> 28:10.910
How'd he end up like you, huh?

28:11.016 --> 28:12.781
He screwed up.

28:25.243 --> 28:27.387
I'm just glad you didn't.

28:32.683 --> 28:34.073
Come here.

29:00.652 --> 29:02.529
Thank you.

29:05.379 --> 29:08.019
Thank you, San Diego!

29:08.020 --> 29:10.063
Come on, Rayna!

29:10.352 --> 29:12.652
Um, this next song we're gonna do

29:12.653 --> 29:14.285
is a... is a new one,

29:14.286 --> 29:16.963
and I would like for you
to give a warm welcome

29:16.964 --> 29:19.914
to the man who's been helping me
write some of this new material.

29:19.915 --> 29:21.866
He's here up on stage with me tonight,

29:21.867 --> 29:24.414
but he is a legend in his own right.

29:24.415 --> 29:28.050
Please welcome Mr. Liam McGuinnis.

they clean our rooms.

34:24.074 --> 34:24.951
I can't help it.

34:25.867 --> 34:28.347
I'm so sorry I went and got
you fired from the band.

34:28.348 --> 34:30.871
Sweetie, you did not get
me fired from this band.

34:32.891 --> 34:34.264
You just gave me a good reason to leave.

34:34.818 --> 34:36.935
Anyway, I'm the one who's sorry...
about Cy.

34:38.891 --> 34:40.107
Unfortunately in this business,

34:40.108 --> 34:41.971
guys like him are an occupational hazard.

34:42.599 --> 34:44.085
Funny thing is, I used
to think he was a jerk

34:44.087 --> 34:45.187
'cause he was a drunk.

34:45.685 --> 34:46.882
There goes that theory.

34:48.518 --> 34:50.100
You handled yourself pretty good.

34:50.583 --> 34:51.737
Dropped his stupid ass.

34:53.373 --> 34:55.132
You knew him before he was famous.

34:55.132 --> 34:56.713
Did he always have such bad manners?

34:57.564 --> 34:58.257
Some guys just don't know

34:58.258 --> 35:00.986
how to be humble about
their talent, you know?

35:02.626 --> 35:04.331
Everyone starts treating 'em like a God,

35:05.264 --> 35:05.855
and pretty soon they think

35:05.856 --> 35:07.435
everyone's just there to serve them.

35:13.601 --> 35:14.971
You didn't come back last night.

35:15.969 --> 35:17.244
I was with Dominic.

35:17.344 --> 35:18.893
Talking about my contract.

35:19.632 --> 35:21.389
He said those clauses were standard.

35:21.792 --> 35:22.956
Of course he'll say that.

35:23.535 --> 35:24.876
Tell me you didn't buy a car.

35:25.407 --> 35:26.301
How could I?

35:26.704 --> 35:28.732
I haven't been paid a penny
since hooking up with you.

35:28.976 --> 35:30.779
Avery, it doesn't happen that quickly.

35:30.815 --> 35:31.872
It takes time.

35:31.873 --> 35:33.069
I signed the contract.

35:34.256 --> 35:35.451
This was my bonus.

35:36.560 --> 35:38.349
How very 1950s of him.

35:38.384 --> 35:40.637
Gives you a car instead
of a 6-figure advance.

35:40.640 --> 35:42.238
You shouldn't have talked
to him without me.

35:42.239 --> 35:45.408
My job is to represent you and
to protect your interests.

35:45.409 --> 35:47.132
No, your job is to work for me,

35:47.424 --> 35:48.818
and I want to work with Dominic.

35:48.819 --> 35:50.332
So you can either get on board

35:50.885 --> 35:52.060
or get out of our way.

35:58.312 --> 35:59.221
Hey. Hey.

35:59.512 --> 36:00.933
You almost ready? Mm-hmm.

36:04.376 --> 36:06.503
Thought you said Deacon was
gonna hitch a ride with us.

36:06.504 --> 36:08.549
He was, but he made other plans.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.548
Think he just wanted to be alone. Mm.

36:10.873 --> 36:12.115
Did you have a good time with your brother?

36:13.865 --> 36:14.629
Yeah.

36:15.304 --> 36:16.373
Where's your family?

36:19.303 --> 36:22.660
Uh, well, it was only ever
my brother and my grandma.

36:22.968 --> 36:24.180
She's out in fort worth.

36:25.912 --> 36:28.181
He was here... serving time.

36:29.609 --> 36:30.997
Eight years for armed robbery.

36:31.799 --> 36:32.948
Bastrop prison.

36:35.369 --> 36:36.885
I came 'cause he's gettin' out, so...

36:37.481 --> 36:38.373
I can take this.

36:42.486 --> 36:43.841
Thank you. After you.

36:45.080 --> 36:46.124
I'm sorry. We spent hours together,

36:46.125 --> 36:47.993
and I never even knew you had a brother.

36:48.365 --> 36:50.088
Yeah. It's a long story.

36:51.340 --> 36:52.197
I got all the time in the world

36:52.198 --> 36:53.441
if you ever feel like tellin' it.

36:54.294 --> 36:57.092
Mr. Butler's petition cites
his grounds for annulment

36:57.093 --> 36:58.436
that he entered into this marriage

36:58.437 --> 37:00.402
under fraudulent circumstances,

37:00.603 --> 37:02.634
and I see that prior

37:02.635 --> 37:04.426
to Mr. Butler's petition for annulment,

37:04.427 --> 37:06.184
you filed a petition for divorce.

37:06.812 --> 37:08.598
Would you like to contest the annulment?

37:09.081 --> 37:10.053
No.

37:11.194 --> 37:12.917
I admit to the fraud.

37:14.299 --> 37:16.201
I made false representation to him

37:16.202 --> 37:17.943
about the nature of our marriage,

37:18.811 --> 37:21.094
and I withdraw my petition for divorce.

37:22.459 --> 37:23.430
I see.

37:23.643 --> 37:25.174
Counsel, my chambers, please.

37:34.381 --> 37:35.641
I am sorry, you know.

37:37.517 --> 37:39.754
I was never gonna be the
wife that you deserved.

37:40.861 --> 37:42.154
And I know you know that.

37:43.167 --> 37:45.259
I just wanted you to know
that I know it, too.

37:46.847 --> 37:48.249
And that's why I did what I did.

37:50.446 --> 37:51.898
So you did me a favor, then.

37:54.573 --> 37:57.165
You know, you once told me that
I wouldn't like you very much

37:57.166 --> 37:58.362
if I got to know you.

38:01.310 --> 38:02.506
You were right.

38:11.599 --> 38:12.700
When are we gonna know?

38:12.831 --> 38:14.284
Well, as soon as they call it, honey.

38:14.912 --> 38:15.996
Who's "they"?

38:16.351 --> 38:17.660
That's a very good question.

38:18.110 --> 38:19.706
Hey, guys.

38:20.094 --> 38:21.152
Mom! Oh!

38:21.153 --> 38:22.109
You're here!

38:22.720 --> 38:26.579
Aw. Hi, babies. Oh, my gosh.

38:26.580 --> 38:27.733
Oh, I'm so happy to see you.

38:27.734 --> 38:28.680
Me, too.

38:29.237 --> 38:32.117
Hey, uh, girls, you... you mind
giving your mom and I a minute?

38:32.118 --> 38:33.407
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

38:34.273 --> 38:35.325
Hey. Hey.

38:37.073 --> 38:38.540
Wow. This is a...

38:39.105 --> 38:40.204
It's a nice surprise.

38:40.210 --> 38:41.326
I wanted to be here.

38:41.538 --> 38:42.926
I wanted to support you tonight.

38:43.458 --> 38:45.373
Thank you. I'm glad to see you.

38:46.481 --> 38:47.310
Me, too.

38:47.314 --> 38:48.331
Hey, I think they're calling it.

38:49.472 --> 38:51.035
Shh, shh. Come on, guys. Guys, guys.

38:54.015 --> 38:55.130
With the election commission

38:55.131 --> 38:58.615
reporting totals for 85%
of Metro precincts,

38:58.618 --> 39:01.082
WKRN... Nashville's News 2

39:01.083 --> 39:03.803
is ready to call the Nashville mayoral race

39:03.804 --> 39:05.300
for Teddy Conrad.

39:05.418 --> 39:07.140
Hey! Dad!

39:08.953 --> 39:10.837
Congratulations, Mr. mayor.

39:11.194 --> 39:13.117
Thank you. Thank you, everyone.
We take you live now

39:13.118 --> 39:14.890
to the campaign of his opponent...
thank you.

39:14.891 --> 39:17.046
Metro councilman Coleman Carlisle.

39:20.106 --> 39:21.057
Thank you all.

39:21.237 --> 39:21.965
I want you all to know

39:21.966 --> 39:25.389
that my service to this
great city of Nashville

39:25.390 --> 39:26.589
does not end tonight.

39:26.590 --> 39:29.564
I will continue to fight
for the public interests

39:29.565 --> 39:32.186
of the hard-working men and
women of this great city

39:32.187 --> 39:36.137
over the special interests
of its greediest citizens.

39:38.285 --> 39:39.516
It's been a pleasure to work with you,

39:39.517 --> 39:42.155
and I want to thank you all for
the hard work you've put in

39:42.156 --> 39:43.134
these past few months.

39:43.135 --> 39:44.877
Without you, none of this
would have been possible,

39:44.878 --> 39:46.589
and I thank you very much, each one of you.

39:46.590 --> 39:47.657
Aw, you, too!

39:49.404 --> 39:51.993
And I want to say that I am deeply grateful

39:52.926 --> 39:54.411
to my beautiful wife Audrey.

39:56.189 --> 39:58.121
Believe me when I say that win or lose,

39:58.719 --> 40:00.058
none of this would have mattered

40:00.254 --> 40:01.522
if I didn't have you to come home to

40:01.523 --> 40:02.479
every single night.

40:09.648 --> 40:11.660
Thank you, Nashville. Thank you.

40:12.736 --> 40:13.689
And we'll be back.

40:24.946 --> 40:26.093
Rayna'll come around.

40:26.754 --> 40:27.999
There's nothing more attractive

40:28.000 --> 40:29.102
than a powerful man.

40:30.274 --> 40:31.984
Is that what you tell yourself?

40:34.087 --> 40:35.396
Being mayor suits him.

40:35.881 --> 40:37.928
Daddy, if you bought this election for him

40:37.929 --> 40:39.812
even after he asked you not to...

40:41.432 --> 40:42.916
I'm never gonna speak to you again.

40:44.601 --> 40:46.503
You know how I like to
take credit for things,

40:46.504 --> 40:47.333
but this one...

40:48.616 --> 40:49.892
He pulled off on his own.

40:52.022 --> 40:52.820
Yeah.

41:06.597 --> 41:07.828
The reporters are gone for the night,

41:07.829 --> 41:09.810
and your family are already
headed home, Mr. mayor.

41:09.860 --> 41:11.521
Is there anything else I can do for you?

41:11.556 --> 41:12.894
Can I arrange for a car
to come pick you up?

41:12.895 --> 41:14.334
No, no, no, no. That'll... that'll be fine.

41:14.335 --> 41:16.072
I'm gonna be here a while
longer, but thank you.

41:16.174 --> 41:17.647
Congratulations, sir. You, too.

41:17.648 --> 41:18.619
You did a great job.

41:18.637 --> 41:20.435
Thanks. Good night, sir. Night.

41:41.148 --> 41:42.887
I know. I'm not supposed to be here.

41:43.802 --> 41:45.577
I just wanted to
congratulate you in person.

41:45.578 --> 41:46.646
No, no, no. Come on in.

41:49.404 --> 41:50.264
I've been worried.

41:51.757 --> 41:52.285
You know, I didn't think it would be

41:52.286 --> 41:53.689
a good idea to call, but...

41:53.998 --> 41:54.825
How are you?

41:55.630 --> 41:56.423
Oh...

41:56.476 --> 41:58.617
Everyone's talking to me
like I'm made of glass.

41:59.804 --> 42:00.716
The pills...

42:01.039 --> 42:02.577
That was a mistake.

42:02.804 --> 42:04.769
I was not trying to commit suicide.

42:05.077 --> 42:06.857
I never wanted to hurt myself.

42:07.437 --> 42:08.249
Oh, you're gonna...

42:08.609 --> 42:10.600
You're gonna be fine.
You'll get through this.

42:12.059 --> 42:15.033
Well, I'm just glad I got to
see you on your big night.

42:17.645 --> 42:18.889
You're gonna be a great mayor.

42:24.254 --> 42:25.177
I should go.

42:27.149 --> 42:27.991
Yeah.

42:28.959 --> 42:30.540
You should... you should go.
