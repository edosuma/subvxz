(ROOSTER CROWS)

01:03.297 --> 01:04.598
(MUSIC PLAYING)

03:12.560 --> 03:13.727
Luisa.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.498
Luisa, are you
coming down soon?

03:32.280 --> 03:34.548
"Kiss number 60."

03:34.582 --> 03:37.751
"The kiss upon the eyes."

03:37.785 --> 03:39.987
"The eyelid kiss
is said to produce"

03:40.020 --> 03:43.757
"A unique sensation
of an unworldly nature,"

03:43.791 --> 03:46.960
"Running from
the base of the spine
to the knees."

03:58.406 --> 03:59.507
BELLOMY: Luisa.

04:03.911 --> 04:05.746
What you been
doing up there, dear?

04:05.779 --> 04:06.980
Studying.

04:07.014 --> 04:08.749
Well, that's good.

04:11.519 --> 04:12.620
What's that for?

04:12.653 --> 04:14.288
Number 26.

04:14.322 --> 04:15.589
Kissing a parent.

04:18.559 --> 04:19.627
Where are you going?

04:19.660 --> 04:21.829
Town.

04:21.862 --> 04:23.731
Before you go,
would you do
your dad a favor

04:23.764 --> 04:26.266
And come over here a second,
let me see how this fits?

04:28.636 --> 04:31.472
I always look
like a sick turkey.

04:31.505 --> 04:32.706
Ah.

04:32.740 --> 04:33.841
(GROANS)
The neckline is too high.

04:33.874 --> 04:34.975
Be careful...

04:36.043 --> 04:38.379
Where did you get that?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.481
That's your
mother's necklace.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.916
I found it in a box of
old letters.

04:44.452 --> 04:46.687
You gave it to her,
didn't you?

04:50.391 --> 04:52.393
I can't believe you were
ever that romantic.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.027
Ha!

04:54.061 --> 04:55.696
Did you stand
outside her window

04:55.729 --> 04:57.598
And serenade her
with love songs too?

04:58.499 --> 04:59.867
Mmm.

04:59.900 --> 05:01.068
(GARGLING)

05:03.771 --> 05:05.373
I guess not.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.840
There are other things
in the world

05:06.874 --> 05:08.609
As important as
love songs, you know.

05:08.642 --> 05:09.843
Like what?

05:09.877 --> 05:12.112
Like work songs,
that's like what.

05:12.145 --> 05:15.416
Like hymns, anthems, marches.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.317
Dirges.

05:18.486 --> 05:19.787
Never mind.

05:21.755 --> 05:22.756
(SIGHS)

05:24.658 --> 05:27.060
Papa, I've got to take wing.

05:27.094 --> 05:28.762
Be careful,
it's duck season.

05:32.433 --> 05:33.701
I don't suppose your wings

05:33.734 --> 05:36.036
Are going to
carry you anywhere
near that carnival, are they?

05:36.069 --> 05:37.605
What carnival?

05:40.574 --> 05:41.842
Luisa.

05:44.578 --> 05:46.547
You look nice in the necklace.

05:50.451 --> 05:51.752
(HAMMERING)

05:53.120 --> 05:54.388
Hi, Mr. Hucklebee.

05:58.025 --> 05:59.460
(MOUTHING WORDS)

06:00.494 --> 06:01.595
Luisa?

06:03.797 --> 06:05.433
How many times,
since they moved in,

06:05.466 --> 06:08.836
Have I told you not to talk
to that idiot next door?

06:08.869 --> 06:10.237
Couple of hundred.

06:10.270 --> 06:13.407
A couple of
hundred times you told me
not to talk to his son either.

06:13.441 --> 06:15.443
Good for me.

06:15.476 --> 06:16.810
And no carnival.

06:24.952 --> 06:28.989
* I'd like to swim
In a clear blue stream

06:29.022 --> 06:32.960
* Where the water is icy cold

06:32.993 --> 06:37.465
* Then go to town
In a golden gown

06:37.498 --> 06:41.001
* And have my fortune told

06:41.034 --> 06:45.072
* Just once, just once

06:45.105 --> 06:49.176
* Just once before I am old

06:49.209 --> 06:52.846
* I'd like to be not evil

06:52.880 --> 06:57.751
* But a little worldly wise

06:57.785 --> 07:01.622
* To be the kind of
girl designed

07:01.655 --> 07:06.627
* To be kissed upon the eyes

07:07.561 --> 07:11.632
* I'd like to dance till 2:00

07:11.665 --> 07:15.035
* Or sometimes dance till dawn

07:15.068 --> 07:18.506
* Or if the band
could stand it

07:18.539 --> 07:22.743
* Just go on and on and on

07:22.776 --> 07:26.647
* Just once, just once

07:26.680 --> 07:31.218
* Before the chance is gone

07:33.053 --> 07:37.257
* I'd like to waste
a week or two

07:37.290 --> 07:41.495
* And never do a chore

07:41.529 --> 07:44.932
* To wear my hair unfastened

07:44.965 --> 07:52.873
* So it billows to the floor

07:52.906 --> 07:59.780
* To do the things
I've dreamed about

07:59.813 --> 08:03.150
* But never done before

08:03.183 --> 08:07.220
* Perhaps I'm bad
or wild or mad

08:07.254 --> 08:10.858
* With lots of grief in store

08:10.891 --> 08:14.962
* But I want much more
Than keepin' house

08:14.995 --> 08:21.869
* Much more, much more,

08:23.904 --> 08:30.878
* Much more!

08:48.061 --> 08:49.697
Where you going?

08:49.730 --> 08:52.065
Uh, got to make sure
the hogs get fed.

08:52.099 --> 08:55.903
You're all dressed up.
Got a date with one of them?

08:55.936 --> 08:58.538
I just got to go
the store first
to get the feed.

09:00.273 --> 09:02.843
All right, and pick me up
some of that cough syrup

09:02.876 --> 09:04.845
That puts me right
to sleep, will you?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.148
I got to get back to work.

09:14.387 --> 09:18.058
(EXCLAIMS)
That's one hammer
I'll never see again.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.960
BELLOMY: Oh, yes, you will.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.599
Keep your crud
on your own side!

09:25.633 --> 09:29.302
You keep your face
and your damn bricks
out of my side!

09:29.336 --> 09:31.204
Or you'll be
wearing brick earmuffs.

09:31.972 --> 09:33.006
Thief!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.174
Murderer!

09:34.207 --> 09:35.275
Lunkhead!

09:36.409 --> 09:37.945
Fuzz bucket!

09:40.280 --> 09:44.351
He's out of his
mind with love,
that son of mine.

09:44.384 --> 09:48.055
Nothing sets
the heart a flutter,
like a good old fashion feud.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.825
What do you think will happen
when they meet on that
road to the carnival?

09:52.760 --> 09:54.662
I don't know.

09:54.695 --> 09:56.664
But they'll never
suspect we planned it.

09:56.697 --> 10:00.067
That son of mine,
he's fantastic.

10:00.100 --> 10:02.936
My daughter is fantastic too.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.773
Just think if they knew
that we wanted them wed.

10:05.806 --> 10:07.340
A pre-arranged marriage?

10:07.374 --> 10:09.242
They'd rather be dead.

10:12.245 --> 10:13.814
Children.

10:13.847 --> 10:15.015
Lovers.

10:15.048 --> 10:16.183
Fantasticks.

10:17.685 --> 10:19.119
Geese.

10:19.152 --> 10:21.188
How cruel ever we are.

10:21.221 --> 10:22.756
How crafty to know

10:22.790 --> 10:25.292
To manipulate children,
you merely say

10:26.126 --> 10:27.828
No.
No.

10:27.861 --> 10:30.197
* Oh!

10:30.230 --> 10:34.101
* Dog's got to bark,
a mule's got to bray

10:34.134 --> 10:38.138
* Soldiers must fight
and preachers must pray

10:38.171 --> 10:42.309
* And children, I guess,
must get their own way

10:42.342 --> 10:45.178
* The minute that you say no

10:46.814 --> 10:50.951
* Why did the kids
pour jam on the cat?

10:50.984 --> 10:55.088
* Raspberry jam
all over the cat?

10:55.122 --> 10:58.992
* Why should the kids
do something like that

10:59.026 --> 11:01.962
* When all that
we said was no?

11:24.017 --> 11:27.955
* Why did the kids
put beans in their ears?

11:27.988 --> 11:32.025
* No one can hear
with beans in their ears

11:32.059 --> 11:35.763
* After a while
the reason appears

11:35.796 --> 11:38.365
* They did it
'cause we said no

11:40.067 --> 11:41.902
* Your daughter
brings a young man in

11:41.935 --> 11:44.171
* Says "Do you like him, Pa?"

11:44.204 --> 11:47.174
* Just tell her,
"He's a fool"

11:47.207 --> 11:51.311
* And then,
you've got a son-in-law

11:51.344 --> 11:57.885
* You've got a son-in-law!

11:57.918 --> 12:01.221
* Sure as the June
comes right after May!

12:01.254 --> 12:05.458
* Sure as the night
comes right after day!

12:05.492 --> 12:09.129
* You can be sure
the devil's to pay

12:09.162 --> 12:13.200
* The minute that you say no

12:13.233 --> 12:15.168
* No!

12:15.202 --> 12:18.005
* Make sure you never say...

12:19.106 --> 12:23.210
* No!

12:29.416 --> 12:31.184
Kids.

12:31.218 --> 12:32.886
Won't it be nice,
when our kids are married

12:32.920 --> 12:36.023
So they can drive
each other crazy,
instead of us?

12:36.056 --> 12:38.959
Right. They're nearly there.

12:38.992 --> 12:43.330
There just one thing missing
for our hero and heroine,
a climax.

12:43.363 --> 12:46.099
You watch what you say,
you are talking
about my daughter.

12:46.133 --> 12:47.801
And speaking in
theatrical terms

12:47.835 --> 12:49.502
We have to find some way
to end the feud

12:49.536 --> 12:52.205
Without them knowing
we made the whole thing up.

12:55.008 --> 12:57.845
Well, how do you
propose we do that?

12:57.878 --> 12:59.479
That's the problem.

13:01.281 --> 13:02.983
Wait a minute.

13:05.853 --> 13:06.987
You see?

13:07.020 --> 13:08.155
Whenever you got a problem

13:08.188 --> 13:10.257
The United States
Postal Service
comes to the rescue.

13:10.290 --> 13:11.424
Yeah, they run
a tight shift.

13:11.458 --> 13:13.861
Let's go, Bellomy.
Let's have a talk
with this fellow...

13:13.894 --> 13:16.296
Are you crazy?
We can't go to the carnival,
the kids will see us,

13:16.329 --> 13:18.265
They'll think
we're looking for them.

13:18.298 --> 13:19.867
Instant heat.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.869
I seem to remember
that's good for
romance. Isn't it?

13:21.902 --> 13:23.270
Uh-huh. Uh-ah!

13:23.303 --> 13:25.138
Fuel to the fire.

13:26.273 --> 13:28.175
"Specialists in
dreams come true."

13:28.208 --> 13:30.410
"Family feud settled."

13:30.443 --> 13:32.179
What are we waiting for?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.056
(PEOPLE TALKING INDISTINCTLY)

14:01.909 --> 14:03.343
(PIANO MUSIC PLAYING)

14:16.223 --> 14:19.960
Romeo, Romeo!
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

14:21.161 --> 14:22.595
MATT: But soft.

14:22.629 --> 14:25.598
What light through
yonder window breaks?

14:25.632 --> 14:29.169
It is the east,
and Juliet is the sun.

14:29.202 --> 14:32.639
Arise, fair sun,
and kill the envious moon.

14:33.506 --> 14:35.342
What if someone sees us?

14:35.375 --> 14:37.177
Come on.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.245
Our fathers.

14:38.278 --> 14:39.646
I don't care
about our fathers.

14:39.679 --> 14:41.348
I don't care
about the wall.

14:41.381 --> 14:44.151
I don't care about
anything but you.

14:44.184 --> 14:47.620
* If we were in
Verona long ago

14:47.654 --> 14:52.993
* And just like the story,
our true love forbidden

14:53.026 --> 14:58.098
* I would study swordplay
and I'd stand
and fight them all

14:58.131 --> 15:01.368
* Anyone who would come
between us

15:03.503 --> 15:07.107
* Would have to deal with me

15:07.140 --> 15:10.978
* I'd stand and face them all

15:11.011 --> 15:13.346
* As one by one they'd fall

15:15.048 --> 15:17.017
* You'd fight them all

15:17.050 --> 15:19.252
* They'd start to fall

15:19.286 --> 15:25.392
BOTH:
* Love conquers all!

15:25.425 --> 15:27.027
* Love!
* I am love!

15:27.060 --> 15:29.029
* You are love!
* I am love!

15:29.062 --> 15:33.433

can ever, ever be

* Love!
* I am love!

15:35.102 --> 15:36.203

* Of love

15:49.082 --> 15:53.153
* You are Polaris,
the one trustworthy star

15:53.186 --> 15:55.188
* You are!
* I am!

15:55.222 --> 15:56.689
* You are!
* I am!

inside of a leaf!

Oh, my God.
What is it?

17:16.803 --> 17:19.071
It's my father.

17:19.106 --> 17:20.140
Must be this one.

17:20.173 --> 17:21.441
MATT: My father too.

17:21.473 --> 17:22.742
They're not
supposed to be here.

17:22.775 --> 17:24.243
Neither are we.

17:26.279 --> 17:29.249
We'll meet tonight,
by the big tree.

17:29.282 --> 17:30.417
In the moonlight.

17:30.450 --> 17:31.551
In moonlight.

17:34.621 --> 17:36.823
It's a century
till moonlight.

17:39.459 --> 17:41.461
I'll never wash
this hand again.

17:48.135 --> 17:49.302
What the devil...

17:49.336 --> 17:50.337
At your service.

17:54.341 --> 17:56.243
Wait, you the famous
El Gallo?

17:56.276 --> 17:57.344
El Gallo.

17:57.377 --> 18:00.847
Oh, yeah. See, we got your
advertisement in the mail

18:00.880 --> 18:03.583
And we got ourselves
a little problem.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.385
A love problem.

18:05.418 --> 18:07.554
You two have a love problem?

18:07.587 --> 18:10.790
And you seek sympathy
from our little
band of outcasts.

18:10.823 --> 18:12.859
What would you two be willing
to do in front of an audience?

18:14.861 --> 18:16.163
No, wait a minute...

18:16.196 --> 18:17.464
We are not
talking about us.

18:17.497 --> 18:19.366
We're talking
about our kids.

18:19.399 --> 18:21.100
Who happen to be
a boy and a girl.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.470
Less challenging.
Follow me.

18:25.472 --> 18:27.907
Although we are not
yet fully prepared

18:27.940 --> 18:30.343
The official opening
of the entire carnival,

18:30.377 --> 18:32.312
I think we can proceed
with our business here.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.348
One moment,
I'll check my files.

18:35.382 --> 18:37.284
I'm sorry,
what did you say
your names were?

18:37.317 --> 18:39.252
Hucklebee.
Bellomy.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.455
I do beg your pardon,
this is "N" through "Z."

18:42.489 --> 18:44.191
Yes, there we are,
"A" through "M."
Oh!

18:44.224 --> 18:45.292
How did you do that?

18:45.325 --> 18:47.194
It wasn't easy
it took months to
set up these files.

18:47.227 --> 18:48.261
Oh my...

18:48.295 --> 18:50.330
(WHISPERING) Quiet.
I'm beginning to
get a picture.

18:51.531 --> 18:53.866
You said you had
a daughter?

18:53.900 --> 18:56.403
Yes.
I see a girl.

18:56.436 --> 18:57.604
Is her name Luisa?

18:57.637 --> 18:58.805
Is that your
daughter's name.

18:58.838 --> 19:01.408
Yes.
That's her. Oh, look.

19:01.441 --> 19:05.412
She is standing
next to a young man
who must be, who must be...

19:05.445 --> 19:07.414
Quick, before
the image fades.

19:07.447 --> 19:09.416
Matt.
That's it.

19:09.449 --> 19:11.351
You're amazing.

19:11.384 --> 19:13.353
They seem to be
happy enough.

19:13.386 --> 19:14.421
What about the feud?

19:14.454 --> 19:16.423
Of course that's there,
I said "seem."

19:16.456 --> 19:18.691
Obviously your children
are feeling
a great deal of torment.

19:18.725 --> 19:19.726
Uncanny.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.262
And you've come to me
for some kind of magic, eh?

19:22.929 --> 19:24.163
You're in luck.

19:26.699 --> 19:28.535
Ooh!

19:28.568 --> 19:32.305
Frankly, we came to you
to find out
how to end this feud.

19:32.339 --> 19:34.641
Many paths lead
to the summit.
Follow me.

19:37.510 --> 19:39.846
You know,
we kind of thought
it'd be a good idea

19:39.879 --> 19:43.650
If my mild-mannered son
was turned into
a rip-roaring hero.

19:43.683 --> 19:45.252
Really?
Well, yes, that would be

19:45.285 --> 19:46.719
The first thought of
a common rural mind.

19:46.753 --> 19:48.788
And by an amazing coincidence,
it's also mine.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.623
Ah! Boy, are we lucky.

19:50.657 --> 19:54.894
Of course to have a hero,
you must first have a villain.

19:54.927 --> 19:58.265
That makes sense. But who?

19:58.298 --> 20:02.469
Let's think, the young lady
knows both of you,
so that wouldn't work.

20:04.971 --> 20:06.673
What about you?
Me?

20:06.706 --> 20:10.443
Oh, I couldn't
do it, for free.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.712
But for a small donation
to my favorite charity...

20:13.713 --> 20:14.814
Yeah.

20:19.519 --> 20:20.587
Yeah.

20:21.721 --> 20:23.823
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

20:23.856 --> 20:26.559
Would $60 be
an insult?

20:26.593 --> 20:28.928
Yes, but I'm used to abuse.

20:28.961 --> 20:31.998
Oh, yes. I see it,
I start to
kidnap his daughter,

20:32.031 --> 20:34.301
Your son runs in to save her.
Then a battle.

20:34.334 --> 20:36.436
I allow the boy to defeat me,
your son becomes a hero,

20:36.469 --> 20:39.005
The parents relent,
the feud is over forever.

20:40.340 --> 20:41.774
She melts into his arms.

20:43.443 --> 20:45.445
How much for such a drama?

20:45.478 --> 20:47.447
That, senor, depends.

20:47.480 --> 20:49.449
Depends on what?
On what else.

20:49.482 --> 20:50.917
The quality of the rape.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.989
Rape? No!
No rape!

20:57.023 --> 20:58.791
Oh, very well then,
the abduction.

20:58.825 --> 21:01.394
The rape, the chase,
the kidnapping.

21:01.428 --> 21:04.564
Call it what you will,
from the Latin rapere.

21:04.597 --> 21:05.865
Meaning "to seize."

21:08.735 --> 21:12.405
* Abductions, abductions,
Theatrical abductions

21:12.439 --> 21:16.376
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous productions

21:17.910 --> 21:21.514
* The sort of thing you see
Upon the operatic stage

21:21.548 --> 21:24.917
* Two lovers are meeting
Their happiness is fleeting

21:24.951 --> 21:28.888
* All at once a bandit man
Is standing there repeating!

21:28.921 --> 21:30.623
* Surrender and so forth

21:30.657 --> 21:32.592
* Give us the girl!
And so forth

21:32.625 --> 21:35.862
* In short they are surrounded
by a gang of angry men

21:35.895 --> 21:39.932
* I see it, I see it
A gang of angry men

21:39.966 --> 21:45.638
* Heaven
I can assure you
this is heaven

21:45.672 --> 21:49.576
* For six,
young love is out of seven

21:49.609 --> 21:51.411
* This is a dream of ecstasy

21:51.444 --> 21:54.614
* How can we deny them
such a dream of ecstasy?

21:54.647 --> 21:57.850
* Sounds a bit expensive
I would like to know the fee

21:57.884 --> 22:01.621
* The people are cheering,
I'm standing center leering

22:01.654 --> 22:05.458
* I wear a cape
and steer a snare
That's really quite endearing

22:05.492 --> 22:08.995
* I enter and so forth
I grab the girl and so forth

22:09.028 --> 22:12.665
* I ravish her and start to
carry her into the night

22:12.699 --> 22:16.436
* The hero, he sees her,
he grabs the girl
and frees her

22:16.469 --> 22:18.371
* He tries to tweak me
by the nose

22:18.405 --> 22:19.839
* Which certainly
should please her

22:19.872 --> 22:23.810
* We argue and so forth
We draw our
swords and so forth

22:23.843 --> 22:27.547
* We shout "En garde!"
And fight until
I stagger and I die

22:27.580 --> 22:30.983
* They're fighting, exciting,
El Gallo starts to die

22:31.017 --> 22:34.654
* The parents relenting,
resolve the scene presenting

22:34.687 --> 22:38.391
* A prefect picture of content
With both of them consenting

22:38.425 --> 22:41.961
* To marriage and so forth
To end the feud and so forth

22:41.994 --> 22:45.665
* They swear to
tear the world apart
And live in harmony

22:45.698 --> 22:49.168
* The lovers are kissing
The parents reminiscing

22:49.201 --> 22:51.070
* The scene is
one of utter bliss

22:51.103 --> 22:53.005
* With not a cliche missing

22:53.039 --> 22:54.841
* There's laughter
and so forth

22:54.874 --> 22:56.409
* A happy dance and so forth

22:56.443 --> 23:00.447
* Then all at once
A harpist and
a piano start to play

23:00.480 --> 23:02.148
* I hear it
* He hears it

23:02.181 --> 23:04.150
* How beautifully they play

23:04.183 --> 23:05.552
* Drama

23:05.585 --> 23:06.686
* A stormy night

23:06.719 --> 23:08.721
* What he's offering is drama

23:08.755 --> 23:09.956
* A bloody fight

23:09.989 --> 23:12.725
* In my life's faded cyclorama

23:12.759 --> 23:13.760
* What a sight

23:13.793 --> 23:15.027
* He tries to shed
a little light

23:15.061 --> 23:18.731
* It's so exciting when
you shed a little light

23:18.765 --> 23:19.932
* Really

23:19.966 --> 23:21.033
* The lovers kiss

23:21.067 --> 23:23.770
* I must admit
that this is thrilling

23:23.803 --> 23:24.871
* Oh, such happiness

23:24.904 --> 23:27.106
* And it can happen
if I'm willing

23:27.139 --> 23:28.107
* How can it miss?

23:28.140 --> 23:29.609
* Just make sure
the price is right

23:29.642 --> 23:33.613
* So why be pikers?
Just make sure
the price is right

23:33.646 --> 23:34.914
* Why should we be pikers?

23:34.947 --> 23:36.883
* Just make sure
the price is right

23:36.916 --> 23:40.620
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

23:40.653 --> 23:44.156
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous productions

23:44.190 --> 23:47.660
* With moonlight, and so forth
A happy end and so forth

23:47.694 --> 23:53.500
* And it all depends on one

23:53.533 --> 23:55.502
* It all depends

23:55.535 --> 23:56.903
* It all...

23:56.936 --> 24:00.907
* Depends on what you pay

24:00.940 --> 24:02.775
* Pay!

24:02.809 --> 24:05.177
* Pay!

24:05.211 --> 24:06.679
* Olay!

24:08.214 --> 24:12.051
First class it is.
Now, let's see.

24:12.084 --> 24:14.086
What else should we use?

24:15.655 --> 24:18.090
Do you want Jo-Jo
the Chicken Lady?

24:19.225 --> 24:20.727
I don't think so.

24:20.760 --> 24:22.529
I know, the Bavarian baby.

24:22.562 --> 24:25.131
I've got one who
is very talented,
he can swallow a sword.

24:25.164 --> 24:27.634
If you throw in $4 extra
he cleans up after himself.

24:27.667 --> 24:28.835
What about that act?

24:28.868 --> 24:30.002
Which?

24:30.036 --> 24:33.272
"Shakespearian company,
direct from London."

24:33.305 --> 24:36.275
"Theatre Royal, Drury Lane."

24:36.308 --> 24:38.144
No. No, you don't want that.

24:38.177 --> 24:39.579
Now, instead...

24:39.612 --> 24:41.013
I think Shakespeare
is a great idea.

24:41.047 --> 24:43.015
After all, my son
thinks he is Romeo.

24:43.049 --> 24:44.817
My daughter would be
a perfect Juliet.

24:44.851 --> 24:48.955
Really, gentlemen,
I assure you
it's not a good idea.

24:48.988 --> 24:51.190
Now, for a first
class abduction...

24:51.223 --> 24:52.659
Let me see.

24:52.692 --> 24:54.927
BELLOMY: But Shakespeare,
that's real class.

24:54.961 --> 24:56.629
I was in a Shakespeare
play once.

24:56.663 --> 24:58.731
HUCKLEBEE: Really?
Uh-huh.

24:58.765 --> 25:00.166
My daughter would
like Shakespeare.

25:00.199 --> 25:04.837
So would my son.
Likes that
I am the Pantomim whatever.

25:04.871 --> 25:08.507
And with Shakespeare,
it's sure to be
done in good taste.

25:12.344 --> 25:16.783
Sir, the players have arrived.

25:16.816 --> 25:19.719
Thank you.
But your services
will not be necessary.

25:19.752 --> 25:22.021
Now or ever.
Back in the trunk.

25:22.054 --> 25:24.256
These men are from London?

25:24.290 --> 25:26.693
Straight from
Theatre Royal, Drury Lane?

25:26.726 --> 25:28.895
Absolutely, one long,
straight ride.

25:29.696 --> 25:30.597
Down.

25:30.630 --> 25:33.900
Don't see us as we are.
Gentlemen, please.

25:33.933 --> 25:38.137
Remove ten pounds of
road dust from these
aged wrinkled cheeks.

25:38.170 --> 25:41.173
See make-up caked in
glowing powder pink.

25:41.207 --> 25:45.277
Imagine a beard, full-blown
and glowing like
the whiskers of a bear.

25:45.311 --> 25:48.881
Imagine hair in a box,
I have all colors.

25:48.915 --> 25:51.784
Please, I beg of you,
imagine hair.

25:57.790 --> 26:01.093
And not these clothes,
dear God, no, no.

26:01.127 --> 26:04.764
Not rags like
every beggar has.

26:04.797 --> 26:06.899
But see me in a doublet.

26:06.933 --> 26:09.035
Mortimer, fetch the doublet.

26:11.771 --> 26:13.039
Thank you.

26:16.142 --> 26:17.910
EL GALLO: Gentlemen,
if you insist
on Shakespeare,

26:17.944 --> 26:19.679
My advice is,
don't over-rehearse.

26:19.712 --> 26:22.949
Say a cue, you'll see,
I'll know it. Go on, try me.

26:24.116 --> 26:25.918
Friends, Romans,
countrymen.

26:25.952 --> 26:27.019
Is what?

26:28.354 --> 26:30.056
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.257
No, no, no.

26:31.290 --> 26:34.293
Don't tell me,
I'll get it.
You'll see.

26:36.963 --> 26:40.332
Oh, yes, of course, of course.
Why, that's easy.

26:40.366 --> 26:42.201
Why didn't you pick
a hard one?

26:42.234 --> 26:44.170
Now, here, watch this.

26:46.939 --> 26:51.077
Friends, Romans, countrymen.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.882
Screw your courage

26:55.915 --> 26:57.884
To that sticking place.

26:57.917 --> 27:00.386
And be not sick.

27:01.420 --> 27:04.056
And pale with reef.

27:04.957 --> 27:07.426
For thou are handmaidens.

27:07.459 --> 27:10.863
But far more fair than she.

27:12.198 --> 27:13.199
Is.

27:17.436 --> 27:18.705
How was that?

27:19.405 --> 27:20.539
Do you think
he can do it?

27:20.572 --> 27:22.875
The chicken lady is cheaper
and you get to keep the eggs.

27:22.909 --> 27:25.845
I got faith in the bard,
let's sign him on.

27:25.878 --> 27:27.914
Thank you. Thank you.

27:30.950 --> 27:33.119
Thank you.

27:33.152 --> 27:36.255
Allow me to
introduce myself.

27:36.288 --> 27:38.858
I am Henry Albertson.

27:38.891 --> 27:40.059
BELLOMY: And who is that?

27:40.092 --> 27:41.861
HENRY: That's Mortimer.

27:41.894 --> 27:44.396
He has been with me
all his life.
He does death scenes.

27:44.430 --> 27:46.833
Would you like to see one?
He's an expert.

27:46.866 --> 27:49.168
Mortimer,
die for the gentlemen.

27:53.339 --> 27:54.340
(CHOKING)

28:03.482 --> 28:04.683
(GROANS)

28:12.925 --> 28:15.361
And that's the short version.

28:15.394 --> 28:17.997
The Indian is
out of the question.

28:18.030 --> 28:19.431
Besides,
I think he is dead.

28:19.465 --> 28:22.301
Oh. Too bad, 'cause
they're a team.
Inseparable.

28:22.334 --> 28:23.369
So what could we
use instead?

28:23.402 --> 28:26.238
How about Siamese twins.
Two for the price of one.

28:26.272 --> 28:28.440
Nah, we're gonna
stick with Shakespeare.

28:28.474 --> 28:31.778
Yeah. It'll be
a lifelong memory
for the children.

28:31.811 --> 28:34.313
Lifelong memory it is.

28:34.346 --> 28:36.215
Still not sure about
the Indian.

28:36.248 --> 28:39.886
Gentlemen, we must hurry.
We have an abduction to stage.

28:40.386 --> 28:42.088
This very night.

28:48.094 --> 28:51.931
Here, you two had
better go home
and rehearse your parts.

28:51.964 --> 28:54.200
Parts? We're not actors.

28:54.233 --> 28:56.402
This is too much
to memorize.

29:00.172 --> 29:02.809
Not actors, you say.
Very well then.

29:03.943 --> 29:05.744
We'll do the abridged version.

29:09.448 --> 29:13.085
* Abductions, abductions
Theatrical abductions

29:13.119 --> 29:15.822
* Complete with
maidens in distress
And fabulous...

29:15.855 --> 29:16.889
That's my part.

29:16.923 --> 29:18.524
* With moonlight and so forth

29:18.557 --> 29:20.359
* And happy
ending and so forth

29:20.392 --> 29:24.430
* And it all depends on

29:24.463 --> 29:27.834
* What you

29:27.867 --> 29:29.001
* Pay

29:29.035 --> 29:30.169
That's my part.

29:33.973 --> 29:35.141
Hello.

29:35.875 --> 29:37.009
Hello.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.519
I should have put on
something warmer.

29:47.553 --> 29:51.090
I didn't expect it
to be so cold.

29:51.123 --> 29:53.525
Feel my hand,
it's trembling.

29:53.559 --> 29:57.563
Oh. Oh, well, here.
I don't need this.

29:57.596 --> 29:58.865
No, you'll freeze.

29:58.898 --> 30:00.066
No, no, really. Please.

30:00.099 --> 30:01.467
I'm fine.
I'm not cold at all.

30:06.906 --> 30:09.441
You're gonna wear it?

30:09.475 --> 30:12.444
Yeah. You just said
you weren't cold, right?

30:14.180 --> 30:15.447
Oh, I'm...

30:19.952 --> 30:21.153
(THUNDERCLAP)

30:25.191 --> 30:26.725
It's all right.

30:30.596 --> 30:32.298
I'm scared, Matt.

30:33.933 --> 30:36.102
I'll take care
of you, Luisa.

30:36.135 --> 30:38.237
I promise,
I'll protect you.

30:40.606 --> 30:42.341
I love you, Matt.

30:43.943 --> 30:45.511
I want there to be
a happy ending.

30:47.113 --> 30:49.081
I promise that there will be.

30:50.082 --> 30:51.217
(THUNDERCLAP)

30:54.553 --> 30:56.355
Feel that?
What?

30:57.589 --> 30:59.025
My hand.

31:00.026 --> 31:01.627
It's trembling too.

31:05.264 --> 31:09.601
* Hear how the wind
begins to whisper

31:09.635 --> 31:14.240
* See how the leaves go
streaming by

31:14.273 --> 31:19.045
* Smell how the velvet rain
is falling,

31:19.078 --> 31:23.549
* Out where the fields are
warm and dry

31:23.582 --> 31:30.056
* Now is the time
to run inside and stay

31:32.591 --> 31:38.998
* Now is the time
to find a hideaway

31:40.399 --> 31:46.638
* Where we can stay

31:53.079 --> 31:57.516
MATT:
* Soon it's gonna rain
I can see it

31:57.549 --> 32:02.154
* Soon it's gonna rain
I can tell

32:02.188 --> 32:08.427
* Soon it's gonna rain
What are we gonna do?

32:10.629 --> 32:15.001
* We'll find
four limbs of a tree

32:15.034 --> 32:19.571
* We'll build
four walls and a floor

32:19.605 --> 32:24.243
* We'll bind it
over with leaves

32:24.276 --> 32:28.447
* And duck inside to stay

32:30.149 --> 32:32.351
* Then we'll let it rain

32:32.384 --> 32:34.653
* We'll not feel it

32:34.686 --> 32:36.722
* Then we'll let it rain

32:36.755 --> 32:39.191
* Ran pell-mell

32:39.225 --> 32:41.427
* And we'll not complain

32:41.460 --> 32:47.199
* If it never stops at all

32:48.300 --> 32:51.437
* We'll live and love

32:51.470 --> 32:58.244
* Within our own four walls

34:44.616 --> 34:46.485
How was it?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.087
It was wonderful.

34:50.889 --> 34:55.726
* We'll find
four limbs of a tree

34:55.761 --> 35:00.499
* We'll build
four walls and a floor

35:00.532 --> 35:05.304
* We'll bind it
over with leaves

35:05.337 --> 35:07.839
* And run inside to stay

35:07.873 --> 35:09.641
* When it's gonna rain

35:09.675 --> 35:12.578
* Come run inside to stay

35:12.611 --> 35:14.346
* When it's gonna rain

35:14.380 --> 35:17.216
* For soon it's gonna rain

35:17.249 --> 35:21.887
* I can see it
I can feel it

35:21.920 --> 35:25.891
* Run inside

35:27.393 --> 35:31.497
* And then we'll let it rain

35:31.530 --> 35:33.199
* Then we'll let it rain

35:33.232 --> 35:35.934
* We'll not feel it

35:35.967 --> 35:37.669
* Then we'll let it rain

35:37.703 --> 35:40.206
* Then we'll let it rain

35:40.239 --> 35:42.474
* Rain pell-mell

35:44.443 --> 35:46.512
* And we'll not complain

35:47.346 --> 35:48.780
* Happy ending

35:49.781 --> 35:52.384
* If it never stops at all...

35:52.418 --> 35:54.486
* Then we'll let it rain

35:54.520 --> 35:59.191
* Why complain
We'll live and love

35:59.225 --> 36:01.193
* Within our walls

36:01.227 --> 36:06.498
* Happily we'll live and love
No cares at all

36:06.532 --> 36:11.337
* Happily we'll live and love

36:12.838 --> 36:19.278
* Within our castle

36:20.546 --> 36:24.783
* Walls

36:24.816 --> 36:25.951
(SCREAMING)

36:38.564 --> 36:40.566
That's it. Go get him, son.

En garde!

For Harry, England,
and St. George.

38:18.797 --> 38:19.998
I'm unharmed.

38:20.031 --> 38:21.367

Shakespeare stuff is great!

39:29.768 --> 39:32.904
You there.
In the black cape.
Let her go.

39:33.672 --> 39:34.740
What?

39:34.773 --> 39:37.509
I said, let her go.

39:37.543 --> 39:39.377
If that's what you want...

39:40.612 --> 39:41.613
(SCREAMS)

39:42.481 --> 39:43.615
Yee-haw!

39:45.584 --> 39:47.719
Hold on, darling.
I've got you.

(LUISA SCREAMING)

40:21.720 --> 40:22.988
He's gone.

40:25.991 --> 40:27.158
He's gone!

40:27.192 --> 40:28.494
Yes.

40:28.527 --> 40:30.496
Luisa.
Son!

40:30.529 --> 40:31.963
Daughter?
Hey.

40:34.900 --> 40:36.468
Papa, he saved me.

40:36.502 --> 40:37.803
Well, in that case...

40:39.137 --> 40:40.572
Neighbor.

40:40.606 --> 40:41.873
Friend.

40:44.543 --> 40:47.679

there would be
a happy ending.

can ever, ever be

41:48.039 --> 41:51.242
Ask your dad
if you can stay up
and watch the sunrise.

You ask him.

isn't it?

43:42.888 --> 43:45.657
Meeting close up
without having to
hide from our fathers.

43:47.192 --> 43:48.994
Here I am.

43:49.027 --> 43:50.395
In the flesh.

43:51.129 --> 43:52.163
Those days are over.

43:56.467 --> 43:57.969
Yes, I see.

44:00.939 --> 44:03.108
Luisa, what's the matter.

44:03.141 --> 44:05.777
I don't want it
to be like this.

44:05.811 --> 44:08.914
Like all the other
people that we know
sitting on a porch swing,

44:08.947 --> 44:11.282
Fumbling for
a timid little kiss.

44:13.084 --> 44:15.053
You like me better
through a crack in the wall?

44:15.086 --> 44:16.121
No!

44:17.956 --> 44:20.025
But you have to be
my hero.

44:20.926 --> 44:22.293
I do?

44:22.327 --> 44:24.763
Yes. You have to be.

44:26.497 --> 44:28.466
You're right.

44:28.499 --> 44:30.068
You're right.

44:32.037 --> 44:33.304
That moon

44:33.905 --> 44:35.006
Is ours.

44:36.174 --> 44:37.442
We own it.

44:38.744 --> 44:40.445
I will not let it wane.

44:41.312 --> 44:42.914
Stop moon.

44:42.948 --> 44:44.249
Wane not.

44:44.282 --> 44:45.984
I command thee.

44:46.017 --> 44:47.118
Wax.

44:47.152 --> 44:49.420
That's it.
That's the man I love.

44:49.454 --> 44:50.889
Come.

44:50.922 --> 44:54.760
Come into my arms
and here, take this,

44:54.793 --> 44:57.362
This burning kiss
to wear upon your lips.

45:05.203 --> 45:06.271
What?

45:10.809 --> 45:12.210
Did you gargle
with something.

45:13.478 --> 45:15.146
Yes, salt water.

45:16.481 --> 45:17.983
Salt water.

45:19.117 --> 45:20.952
It kills the germs.

45:37.502 --> 45:39.370
This plum is
too ripe.

45:40.371 --> 45:41.506
Sorry.

45:45.944 --> 45:47.378
Please don't watch me
while I'm eating.

the golden moonbeam

* So take it away,

it really is a pity
It used to be so pretty

ALL:
* Sorry

48:15.961 --> 48:17.328
Tell you one thing,

48:17.362 --> 48:20.531
Staying up all night
isn't what it's
cracked up to be.

48:20.565 --> 48:22.067
Well, it might've been
if you hadn't

48:22.100 --> 48:23.601
Sat around yawning
the whole time.

48:25.236 --> 48:27.372
Sorry.

48:27.405 --> 48:29.607
But I had an exhausting
battle, remember?

48:29.640 --> 48:32.010
And what about me?
What did I have?

48:34.212 --> 48:38.649
You're not the only ones
who didn't get any
sleep around here.

48:38.683 --> 48:41.987
Damn swing creaking all night,
and you two bickering.

48:42.020 --> 48:44.655
Why don't you put
some oil in that thing?

48:47.258 --> 48:49.260
Why don't ya
paint your house?

48:49.294 --> 48:51.196
What? What'd he say?

48:51.229 --> 48:53.531
It's an eyesore.
Ruins the whole
neighborhood.

48:53.564 --> 48:56.267
Neighborhood?
There ain't no
neighborhood around here!

48:56.301 --> 48:58.203
Slopping the pigs
right in front of the house.

48:58.236 --> 49:00.171
While we're at it,
I just assumed everybody

49:00.205 --> 49:02.307
Didn't walk through
my corn field singing.

49:02.340 --> 49:04.675
What are you two
fighting about?
This is our argument.

49:04.709 --> 49:06.044
What? What'd she say?

49:06.077 --> 49:07.712
She said,
"This is our argument!"

49:07.745 --> 49:10.015
Well, knock it off,
for crying out loud.

49:10.048 --> 49:13.684
If we thought you
were gonna act like this,
we never would've...

49:13.718 --> 49:17.288
I just think that
maybe a "thank you"
might have been in order.

49:18.189 --> 49:20.025
Never would've what?

49:20.058 --> 49:21.059
(EXHALES)

49:23.461 --> 49:26.064
We never would've let
you stay out all night!

49:26.097 --> 49:29.167
Your father and I,
we treat you like adults.

49:29.200 --> 49:32.170
And you turn around
and you act like
a couple of spoilt kids.

49:32.203 --> 49:34.572
Now, I want you two
to kiss and make up.

49:34.605 --> 49:36.341
This should be
a beautiful moment.

49:36.374 --> 49:37.642
An act of heroism
took place last night.

49:37.675 --> 49:39.110
Come on.

49:39.144 --> 49:40.245
No expense was spared.

49:44.615 --> 49:46.151
Bellomy.

49:53.524 --> 49:56.027
Nice going, Bellomy.

49:56.061 --> 50:00.131
Two hundred and fifty
smackers down the drain.

50:01.499 --> 50:03.768
This is just great.

50:03.801 --> 50:05.270
MATT: Wait a minute.

50:05.303 --> 50:07.105
You two paid for us?

50:09.540 --> 50:11.442
All my heroics
were make believe?

50:19.484 --> 50:21.486
What would you call
a man who would stoop

50:21.519 --> 50:23.521
As low as to do
something like this?

50:24.255 --> 50:25.490
A father.

50:30.861 --> 50:32.530
Matt, where are you going?

50:32.563 --> 50:34.132
I got a score to settle.

50:34.165 --> 50:36.101
Wait, I'm coming with you.

50:36.134 --> 50:37.202
Luisa.

50:37.802 --> 50:38.803
Luisa.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.574
Matt, wait,
I'm coming with you.

50:54.819 --> 50:56.554
No refunds.
Even with a receipt.

51:00.225 --> 51:02.193
Somebody
get me a sword.

51:16.707 --> 51:17.708
(GROANS)

51:23.181 --> 51:24.415
En garde!

51:34.625 --> 51:35.726
Up a bit with the wrists.

51:37.328 --> 51:38.696
A foot back more.

51:38.729 --> 51:41.166
Never take your eyes
from your opponent!

51:42.900 --> 51:44.535
Quickly!

51:44.569 --> 51:46.704
Aim for the entrails.

51:46.737 --> 51:48.139
Good. Encore.

51:52.477 --> 51:53.844
You have great enthusiasm,

51:53.878 --> 51:56.447
But as in all things,
experience counts
for everything.

52:08.393 --> 52:09.394
(GRUNTING)

52:10.828 --> 52:12.463
It's impolite
to attack a man

52:12.497 --> 52:13.831
Once he's in his
space of shaving.

52:15.500 --> 52:17.702
Oh, I forgot.
You don't shave.

52:20.938 --> 52:22.139
(GRUNTING)

52:25.643 --> 52:27.478
I'm available for lessons.

52:49.934 --> 52:51.836
Matt!

52:51.869 --> 52:54.939
This isn't much fun
when you're not being paid.

52:57.608 --> 52:58.809
Matt?

53:08.886 --> 53:10.588
You... You...

53:10.621 --> 53:11.656
Villain.

53:13.824 --> 53:14.825
Don't do that.

53:16.894 --> 53:18.796
You'll hurt your hand.

53:29.974 --> 53:31.409
Nice boy.

53:35.680 --> 53:36.947
Wait.

53:36.981 --> 53:38.249
What?

53:38.283 --> 53:40.485
What did you say?

53:40.518 --> 53:42.387
I didn't say anything.

53:42.420 --> 53:44.489
Then what
were you thinking?

53:44.522 --> 53:46.624
I wasn't
thinking anything.

53:46.657 --> 53:50.428
Yes you were. Well,
what are you thinking now?

53:50.461 --> 53:53.298
Well...
Go on say it.

53:53.331 --> 53:55.700
I just wanted to tell you,
I think you were right.

53:56.867 --> 53:58.703
Right?

53:58.736 --> 54:00.771
Not to pick up
the sword again.

54:00.805 --> 54:01.972
Not to fight with him.

54:03.808 --> 54:05.543
What I mean is...

54:05.576 --> 54:07.478
Maybe you're not ready yet.

54:08.479 --> 54:09.847
To be a hero.

54:10.481 --> 54:11.516
No?

54:12.683 --> 54:14.352
Well, maybe
I can be the villain.

54:14.385 --> 54:16.687
He seems to have
all the good scenes.

54:16.721 --> 54:18.389
With you anyway.

54:19.324 --> 54:20.825
"You'll hurt your hand."

54:20.858 --> 54:23.894
(SCOFFS) What a line.

54:26.797 --> 54:28.333
I don't need you.

54:28.366 --> 54:29.700
I don't need any of this.

54:29.734 --> 54:31.736
I'm gonna go out
into the big world

54:31.769 --> 54:34.939
And make a pile of money
and surround myself
with beautiful women

54:34.972 --> 54:36.707
Who appreciate me.

54:37.908 --> 54:39.510
See if I care.

54:52.122 --> 54:53.458
(SOBBING)

55:38.536 --> 55:44.642
* Beyond that road
lies a shining world

55:44.675 --> 55:50.581
* Beyond that
road lies despair

55:50.615 --> 55:56.821
* Beyond that road
Lies a world that's gleaming

55:56.854 --> 55:59.390
* People who are scheming

55:59.824 --> 56:01.125
* Beauty!

56:01.158 --> 56:02.693
EL GALLO:
* Hunger!

56:02.727 --> 56:03.961
* Glory!

56:03.994 --> 56:05.796
* Sorrow!

56:05.830 --> 56:10.000
* Never a pain or care

56:15.105 --> 56:18.576
* He's liable to find

56:18.609 --> 56:24.615
* A couple of surprises there

56:26.484 --> 56:31.622
* For, I can see it!

56:32.957 --> 56:36.927
* Shining somewhere!

56:38.763 --> 56:43.167
* Bright lights somewhere
Invite me to come there

56:43.200 --> 56:48.939
* And learn!
And I'm ready!

56:48.973 --> 56:52.810
* I can hear it!

56:54.144 --> 56:58.649
* Sirens singing!

57:00.017 --> 57:03.988
* Inside my ear
I hear them all singing

57:04.722 --> 57:10.728
* Come learn!

57:10.761 --> 57:15.733
* Who knows, maybe
All the visions I can see

57:15.766 --> 57:19.036
* May be waiting
just for me to say

57:19.069 --> 57:20.505
* I can see it!

57:20.538 --> 57:21.739
* Say

57:21.772 --> 57:23.908
* Shining somewhere!
* Say!

57:23.941 --> 57:26.511
* Take me there and
make me a part of it!

57:26.544 --> 57:27.945
* Make

57:27.978 --> 57:31.782
* Make me see
those shining
sights inside of me!

57:31.816 --> 57:34.519
* Make him feel it!

57:34.552 --> 57:37.187
* Make me feel
those lights inside

57:37.221 --> 57:42.727
* I know it's so
I know that it really may be!

57:42.760 --> 57:44.995
* Just what
I always waited for!

57:45.029 --> 57:47.732
* This is what
my life's created for!

57:47.765 --> 57:53.971
* Let me learn!

58:02.580 --> 58:04.081
Hello, big boy.

58:05.282 --> 58:07.484
Welcome to the Casbah.

58:14.725 --> 58:17.595
Getting kinda dizzy.
That perfume!

58:17.628 --> 58:19.564
It's Alexia de L'Amour.

58:20.264 --> 58:21.866
Drink that.

58:37.281 --> 58:38.716
What is it?

58:38.749 --> 58:40.685
A little something
from the Caliph.

58:40.718 --> 58:44.889
Two parts rhino horn,
one part mandrake,
one part ginseng.

58:44.922 --> 58:48.258
Absinthe and a little
sprinkling of cojonas.

58:49.159 --> 58:50.227
What's that?

58:50.260 --> 58:51.261
Don't ask.

59:24.762 --> 59:29.900
* I'd like to swim
in a clear blue stream

59:29.934 --> 59:34.905
* Where the water is icy cold

59:34.939 --> 59:40.645
* Then go to town
In a golden gown

59:40.678 --> 59:45.683
* And have my fortune told

59:45.716 --> 59:48.953
Just once.
Just once before you're old.

59:48.986 --> 59:50.187
It's my bandit.

59:50.220 --> 59:51.388
Your bandit, yes.

59:51.421 --> 59:53.223
What are you doing
up there in that tree?

59:53.257 --> 59:54.659
Growing ripe.

59:54.692 --> 59:55.993
Don't grow too
ripe or you'll fall.

59:56.026 --> 59:57.127
Very wise.

59:59.263 --> 01:00:01.331
What do you see from up there?

01:00:01.365 --> 01:00:02.667
Everything.

01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:03.801
Do you see Matt?

01:00:03.834 --> 01:00:04.869
Do you care?

01:00:04.902 --> 01:00:06.036
No, I just wondered.

01:00:08.305 --> 01:00:10.174
Can I climb up
there beside you?

01:00:10.207 --> 01:00:11.709
You can if you can.

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.914
You know,
there's always my way.

01:00:18.816 --> 01:00:20.317
Put a ladder in the back.

01:00:48.212 --> 01:00:49.780
Is it fun to be a bandit?

01:00:49.814 --> 01:00:51.816
It has its moments, yes.

01:00:51.849 --> 01:00:53.751
I think it must be fun.

01:00:54.451 --> 01:00:55.753
So...

01:00:57.187 --> 01:00:59.289
How do you do it?

01:00:59.323 --> 01:01:01.992
Do you ride into town
pretending to be a carnival

01:01:02.026 --> 01:01:04.261
And then steal things
when people aren't looking?

01:01:04.294 --> 01:01:05.930
That's one way to go.

01:01:05.963 --> 01:01:07.297
And what do you steal?

01:01:07.331 --> 01:01:10.200
Whatever's most valuable.
Whatever's treasured most.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.070
That's more like it.

01:01:17.908 --> 01:01:19.744
You see this ribbon?

01:01:22.412 --> 01:01:24.181
That's where you
gave me a bruise.

01:01:36.927 --> 01:01:38.462
Take me with you.

01:01:42.232 --> 01:01:44.034
Show me your world.

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.941
What is it that you want?

01:01:53.343 --> 01:01:54.945
That's just it.

01:01:55.946 --> 01:01:57.948
I don't know what I want.

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:02.152
I want things
I've only heard about

01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:04.721
Or dreamed.

01:02:06.824 --> 01:02:09.860
I want to see places
I've never seen before.

01:02:09.894 --> 01:02:12.729
I want to do things
I've never ever done.

01:02:13.831 --> 01:02:15.432
You and I.

01:02:15.465 --> 01:02:17.835
Us. Together.

01:02:18.568 --> 01:02:19.837
Yes.

01:02:20.938 --> 01:02:23.107
Dancing forever and forever.

01:02:25.009 --> 01:02:28.512
* Round and round,
'Neath a magic spell

01:02:28.545 --> 01:02:32.249
* Velvet gown, pink lapel

01:02:32.282 --> 01:02:35.853
* Life is a colorful carousel

01:02:35.886 --> 01:02:37.822
* Reckless and terribly gay!

01:02:37.855 --> 01:02:40.791
* I'm ready anytime

01:02:40.825 --> 01:02:44.862
* If you'll take me,
I'm ready to go!

01:02:44.895 --> 01:02:47.932
* So show the way to me

01:02:47.965 --> 01:02:50.100
* I will try to be

01:02:50.134 --> 01:02:51.869
* Ready to go

01:03:06.951 --> 01:03:10.554
* I seem to see Venice
We're on a lagoon

01:03:10.587 --> 01:03:14.124
* A gondolier's crooning
a gondola tune

01:03:14.158 --> 01:03:17.361
* The air makes your hair
Billow blue in the moon!

01:03:17.394 --> 01:03:20.064
* I could swoon!

01:03:20.097 --> 01:03:22.132
* You're so blue
in the moon! *

01:03:23.300 --> 01:03:26.136
Oh, look.
Carnival in Venice.

01:03:26.170 --> 01:03:28.372
Something I've
always wanted to see.

01:03:28.405 --> 01:03:30.941
What's this?
A mask.

01:03:30.975 --> 01:03:32.076
But it doesn't
have any expression.

01:03:32.109 --> 01:03:33.443
Exactly.

01:03:33.477 --> 01:03:36.313
As long as you wear this mask
your feelings will
never betray you.

01:03:36.346 --> 01:03:39.149
No matter what happens,
with the mask,
you'll be able to laugh

01:03:39.183 --> 01:03:41.285
And dance through it all.

01:03:41.318 --> 01:03:42.419
That boy looks familiar.

01:03:42.452 --> 01:03:43.420
Of course.

01:03:43.453 --> 01:03:46.023
He's a country bumpkin,
they all look the same.

01:03:46.056 --> 01:03:48.258
And they all wind up
the same way.

01:03:48.292 --> 01:03:49.559
They're stealing his wallet.

01:03:49.593 --> 01:03:52.296
Put on the mask,
then it's amusing.

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.265
Oh, yes, I see,
they're just having fun.

01:03:56.133 --> 01:03:57.935
Bene! Bene!

01:03:59.003 --> 01:04:00.270
(GRUNTS)

01:04:00.304 --> 01:04:01.405
EL GALLO: Mustn't
cover the necklace.

01:04:01.438 --> 01:04:03.007
Luisa.

01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:06.310
It's much too beautiful.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:11.381
* We'll just dance!

01:04:11.415 --> 01:04:18.388
* We'll kick up our heels
to music and dance!

01:04:18.422 --> 01:04:21.325
* Until my head
reels with music

01:04:21.358 --> 01:04:24.661
* Just like
a lovely real romance
Luisa!

01:04:24.694 --> 01:04:29.099
* All we'll do is daily dance

01:04:29.133 --> 01:04:32.469
* All we'll do is just dance

01:04:32.502 --> 01:04:35.605
* All we'll do is just dance

01:04:35.639 --> 01:04:37.908
* All we'll do is just...
Luisa!

01:04:37.942 --> 01:04:40.177
Really? I'm exhausted.

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:42.679
You can't be.
The evening's just started.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:46.383
* I seem to see Athens,
it's terribly chic

01:04:46.416 --> 01:04:50.087
* Atop the Acropolis,
it's terribly Greek

01:04:50.120 --> 01:04:53.457
* There's Venus,
Adonis, and us
Cheek to cheek

01:04:53.490 --> 01:04:55.692
* Oh, how chic!

01:04:55.725 --> 01:04:58.062
* To be Greek
cheek to cheek! *

01:05:00.130 --> 01:05:01.131
(COUGHS)

01:05:03.167 --> 01:05:04.434
Oh, look.

01:05:05.202 --> 01:05:07.337
A Greek temple.

01:05:07.371 --> 01:05:10.207
And they're having
some sort of contest.

01:05:10.240 --> 01:05:11.976
Maybe it's the Olympics!

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.945
Yes! It's Greek wrestling.

01:05:14.979 --> 01:05:16.480
Yes.

01:05:16.513 --> 01:05:19.249
That boy...
They're gonna kill him.

01:05:19.283 --> 01:05:21.485
Now remember,
if it is unpleasant.

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:24.021
Yes, of course, the mask.

01:05:25.122 --> 01:05:28.525
Oh, I see, It's a game.

01:05:28.558 --> 01:05:31.128
I just love classic sports.

01:05:32.129 --> 01:05:34.731
You look lovely.

01:05:34.764 --> 01:05:39.703
* We'll just dance!

01:05:39.736 --> 01:05:46.510
* We'll kick up our heels
to music and dance!

01:05:46.543 --> 01:05:49.213
* Until my head
reels with music

01:05:49.246 --> 01:05:52.749
* Just like
a lovely real romance
Luisa!

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:56.486
* All we'll do is daily dance

01:05:56.520 --> 01:05:59.089
* All we'll do is just dance

01:05:59.589 --> 01:06:00.957
Luisa.

01:06:00.991 --> 01:06:04.428
* All we'll do is just dance
All we'll do is just... *

01:06:04.461 --> 01:06:05.562
Phew!

01:06:05.595 --> 01:06:07.297
Couldn't we just
sit this one out?

01:06:07.331 --> 01:06:10.000
Ridiculous.
When there's music
to be danced to?

01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:12.236
Play, gypsies.

01:06:14.438 --> 01:06:18.108
* We'll be in Benghazi
or maybe Bombay

01:06:18.142 --> 01:06:21.478
* I understand
India is terribly gay

01:06:21.511 --> 01:06:24.648
* The natives assemble
on feast day and play

01:06:24.681 --> 01:06:27.184
* With their snakes?

01:06:27.217 --> 01:06:29.353
* What a racket it makes!

01:06:31.488 --> 01:06:33.490
(HISSING)

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:36.260
I think
I'm going to love India.

01:06:36.293 --> 01:06:39.229
Such a big population,
and I adore crowds.

01:06:40.097 --> 01:06:42.066
Oh, look, there's a fakir.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:43.367
Hi, fakir.

01:06:44.468 --> 01:06:46.336
See, he's there
with his assistants.

01:06:46.370 --> 01:06:49.606
They all know Yogi
and they're just
all loads of fun.

01:06:49.639 --> 01:06:50.707
(GROANING)

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:52.676
There's a young one.

01:06:52.709 --> 01:06:54.744
They're putting him
down on some nails.

01:06:54.778 --> 01:06:57.614
If he fails, he'll be
cut to bits by those nails.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:59.616
(WHIMPERING)

01:06:59.649 --> 01:07:01.085
I don't want to see this.

01:07:01.118 --> 01:07:03.620
You're probably right,
it may be someone you know.

01:07:05.522 --> 01:07:08.058
LUISA: (LAUGHS)
I see, he's just faking.

01:07:08.092 --> 01:07:09.659
He's a fake fakir.

01:07:11.228 --> 01:07:12.262
Fake.

01:07:12.729 --> 01:07:14.431
(SCREAMING)

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.334
I hate fakes.

01:07:17.367 --> 01:07:21.838
* We'll just dance!

01:07:21.871 --> 01:07:26.476
* We'll kick up our heels
to music and dance!

01:07:26.510 --> 01:07:28.478
* Until my head
reels with music

01:07:28.512 --> 01:07:30.414
* Just like
a lovely real romance

01:07:30.447 --> 01:07:32.449
* All we'll do
is daily dance

01:07:32.482 --> 01:07:36.686
* I can see
the friendly natives!

01:07:36.720 --> 01:07:38.688
* All we'll do is just dance

01:07:38.722 --> 01:07:41.191
* All we'll do is just
All we'll do is just

01:07:41.225 --> 01:07:43.793
* All we'll do is just
All we'll do is just

01:07:45.129 --> 01:07:50.567
* All we'll do

01:07:52.369 --> 01:07:54.704
* is just

01:07:54.738 --> 01:08:01.378
* dance

01:08:04.881 --> 01:08:06.416
(THUNDER CRACKING)

01:08:15.459 --> 01:08:16.560
I'm suddenly afraid.

01:08:16.593 --> 01:08:18.228
Of what?

01:08:18.261 --> 01:08:19.629
I don't know.

01:08:20.464 --> 01:08:21.831
Something.

01:08:21.865 --> 01:08:23.267
Maybe you should go home.

01:08:24.934 --> 01:08:28.572
All my life I've waited
for something
magical to happen.

01:08:30.174 --> 01:08:32.276
Now at last,
with you, it will.

01:08:32.309 --> 01:08:34.711
Or what if it's
all just illusions?

01:08:35.612 --> 01:08:37.613
Sleight of hand.

01:08:38.782 --> 01:08:40.317
This for example.

01:08:42.319 --> 01:08:43.787
(PEOPLE SHOUTING)

01:08:46.723 --> 01:08:48.758
The glamorous sideshows.

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:51.295
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:08:57.801 --> 01:08:59.169
It's all scenery.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:01.404
Smoke

01:09:02.238 --> 01:09:03.573
And mirrors.

01:09:04.508 --> 01:09:06.176
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

01:09:19.555 --> 01:09:20.857
Well, what do you think now?

01:09:23.660 --> 01:09:25.395
I think you're wonderful.

01:09:27.596 --> 01:09:30.767
But don't you understand
it was only a trick?

01:09:30.800 --> 01:09:32.236
And when you're
dealing with tricks,

01:09:32.269 --> 01:09:35.305
What you see isn't
always what you get.

01:09:48.818 --> 01:09:51.220
I'm warning you to be careful.

01:09:53.323 --> 01:09:54.758
I know you are.

01:09:56.426 --> 01:09:57.894
But I trust you.

01:09:59.829 --> 01:10:02.532
I know that you'll
make it all right.

01:10:06.336 --> 01:10:07.637
Oh, very well then.

01:10:07.671 --> 01:10:10.474
You better go pack
some things so that
we can run away together.

01:10:10.507 --> 01:10:13.410
After all, you can't
run away and stay at home
at the same time.

01:10:13.443 --> 01:10:16.413
Well, who cares
if we never see this
one goat town again.

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:17.814
We can drop by
in five or six years

01:10:17.847 --> 01:10:19.316
To see if your father
is still alive.

01:10:22.719 --> 01:10:24.421
What?
The world

01:10:25.455 --> 01:10:26.723
Is waiting.

01:10:29.593 --> 01:10:31.027
I wonder if Matt...

01:10:31.060 --> 01:10:32.329
Matt?

01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:38.468
Never mind.

01:10:41.004 --> 01:10:42.839
All right, go.

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:45.342
Get ready.

01:10:45.375 --> 01:10:47.877
See if you can borrow
a little money
while you're about it.

01:10:53.850 --> 01:10:55.452
Kiss me first.

01:11:19.108 --> 01:11:23.747
No matter what happens,
I'll never,
ever forget that kiss.

01:11:26.049 --> 01:11:28.084
A unique sensation
of an unworldly nature

01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:30.387
Running from the base of
the spine to the knees.

01:11:32.055 --> 01:11:33.056
(LAUGHS)

01:11:42.366 --> 01:11:43.467
Wait.

01:11:45.068 --> 01:11:48.405
Give me a trinket
to pledge that
you'll come back.

01:11:49.473 --> 01:11:50.607
That necklace.

01:11:51.541 --> 01:11:52.842
It was my mother's.

01:11:52.876 --> 01:11:55.412
Good. It will
service your pledge.

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.658
I will leave you
my mother's necklace

01:12:08.692 --> 01:12:10.494
Because it is
my favorite thing.

01:12:11.761 --> 01:12:13.062
Guard it.

01:12:13.096 --> 01:12:14.798
And I'll go pack.

01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.867
I won't be long.

01:12:22.739 --> 01:12:24.441
You're really
taking me with you?

01:12:25.809 --> 01:12:27.110
Would I lie?

01:12:43.192 --> 01:12:44.861
I won't be long.

01:12:52.602 --> 01:12:53.737
You will be here?

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.139
I promise.

01:13:12.489 --> 01:13:14.390
All right, move it out.

01:13:24.934 --> 01:13:26.169
(EXHALES DEEPLY)

01:13:49.759 --> 01:13:50.860
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:04.040
Ah, the prodigal son
comes out from his trip
around the world.

01:14:04.073 --> 01:14:07.744
Allow me to say,
you look much wiser
but less well groomed.

01:14:07.777 --> 01:14:08.912
Leave me alone.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.180
Fine, I'm in a bit of
a rush, anyway.

01:14:11.214 --> 01:14:12.916
Where did you get that?
Oh, this?

01:14:13.750 --> 01:14:14.951
It's just a souvenir.

01:14:14.984 --> 01:14:16.219
It's Luisa's.

01:14:16.252 --> 01:14:17.521
You stole it.

01:14:17.554 --> 01:14:19.055
Please, she gave it to me.

01:14:19.088 --> 01:14:20.790
Not that it's any
business of yours.
Now, as I said.

01:14:20.824 --> 01:14:21.825
(GRUNTS)

01:14:23.693 --> 01:14:24.828
(GROANS)

01:14:26.763 --> 01:14:28.698
All right. Move it out.

01:14:40.243 --> 01:14:41.545
El Gallo.

01:14:53.723 --> 01:14:54.958
El Gallo!

01:14:59.863 --> 01:15:01.097
El Gallo?

01:15:02.599 --> 01:15:03.833
El Gallo!

01:15:12.108 --> 01:15:13.176
(SOBBING)

01:15:20.249 --> 01:15:24.654
EL GALLO:
There is a curious paradox
that no one can explain.

01:15:24.688 --> 01:15:28.758
Who understands the secret
of the reaping of the grain.

01:15:28.792 --> 01:15:33.196
Who understands
why spring is born
out of winter's laboring pain.

01:15:33.229 --> 01:15:36.633
Or why we all must die a bit
before we grow again.

01:15:41.971 --> 01:15:43.106
Matt.

01:15:47.176 --> 01:15:48.778
What happened?

01:15:49.913 --> 01:15:51.915
You look awful.

01:15:51.948 --> 01:15:54.784
It isn't worth tears,
Luisa, please.

01:15:58.855 --> 01:16:01.925
Did you find the money
and the beautiful women.

01:16:02.726 --> 01:16:04.761
I can't remember, I...

01:16:04.794 --> 01:16:07.664
I was drugged
or hypnotized
or something.

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:12.802
There was this
funny light and mirrors.

01:16:13.369 --> 01:16:14.771
I know.

01:16:15.404 --> 01:16:17.306
And there was this music.

01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.909
Strange music and people

01:16:19.943 --> 01:16:21.778
Turning and spinning and...

01:16:21.811 --> 01:16:23.112
Wearing masks.

01:16:24.047 --> 01:16:25.782
I remember crying out.

01:16:25.815 --> 01:16:27.350
But no one came
to help you.

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:35.158
I'm sorry, Matt.

01:16:37.093 --> 01:16:38.795
No, I...

01:16:38.828 --> 01:16:40.263
It's all right.

01:16:42.131 --> 01:16:44.067
I deserved it.

01:16:44.100 --> 01:16:45.835
I've been foolish.

01:16:46.870 --> 01:16:48.237
I have, too.

01:16:49.305 --> 01:16:51.374
Believe me,
more than you.

01:17:00.183 --> 01:17:04.020
* When the month was May

01:17:04.053 --> 01:17:10.259
* When the stage was hung
for my holiday

01:17:11.094 --> 01:17:14.698
* I saw shining lights

01:17:14.731 --> 01:17:18.201
* But I never knew

01:17:18.234 --> 01:17:21.137
* They were you
They were you

01:17:22.138 --> 01:17:23.940
* They were you

01:17:25.809 --> 01:17:29.245
* When the dance was done

01:17:29.278 --> 01:17:32.882
* When I went my way

01:17:32.916 --> 01:17:39.956
* When I tried to find
rainbows far away

01:17:39.989 --> 01:17:43.392
* All the lovely lights

01:17:43.426 --> 01:17:47.096

* They were you

BOTH:
* Without you near me

01:18:01.911 --> 01:18:07.416
* I can't see

01:18:08.351 --> 01:18:15.191
* When you're near me

01:18:15.224 --> 01:18:20.296
* Wonderful things come to be

01:18:22.098 --> 01:18:25.935
* Every secret prayer

01:18:25.969 --> 01:18:29.472
* Every fancy free

01:18:29.505 --> 01:18:36.780
* Everything I dared
for both you and me

01:18:36.813 --> 01:18:40.283
* All my wildest dreams

01:18:40.316 --> 01:18:44.287
* Multiplied by two

01:18:44.320 --> 01:18:46.189

* They were you

01:19:01.470 --> 01:19:06.776
* They were you

01:19:28.531 --> 01:19:30.299
I missed you, Matt.

01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.336
I missed you, too.

01:19:33.369 --> 01:19:35.104
Here, maybe I can
stop your bleeding.

01:19:35.138 --> 01:19:36.505
You already have.

01:19:43.379 --> 01:19:45.248
You've been hurt too.

01:19:48.551 --> 01:19:51.154
Look, it's beginning to snow.

01:19:52.221 --> 01:19:53.990
I know.
Here.

01:19:54.991 --> 01:19:56.359
Take my coat.

01:19:57.426 --> 01:19:59.395
Both.

01:19:59.428 --> 01:20:01.564
There's room there
for both.

01:20:11.040 --> 01:20:15.144
* Love! You are love!

01:20:15.178 --> 01:20:16.880
* You are love!

01:20:16.913 --> 01:20:23.252
* Better far than a metaphor
can ever, ever be

01:20:24.387 --> 01:20:26.990
* Love!
* You are love!

01:20:27.023 --> 01:20:28.457
* You are love!

01:20:28.491 --> 01:20:31.060
* You are love!

* My mystery

01:20:34.998 --> 01:20:38.167
* My mystery

* Of Love!

Look, they've come back.

It's a miracle.

01:20:46.075 --> 01:20:47.476
They're home.

EL GALLO:
* Try to remember
the kind of September

* When life was slow
and oh, so mellow

* Try to remember
the kind of September

01:21:15.104 --> 01:21:21.610
* When grass was green
and grain was yellow

01:21:21.644 --> 01:21:27.984
* Try to remember
the kind of September

01:21:28.017 --> 01:21:34.623
* When you were
a tender and callow fellow

01:21:34.657 --> 01:21:40.663
* Try to remember,
and if you remember

01:21:40.696 --> 01:21:42.298
* Then follow

01:21:47.670 --> 01:21:53.409
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

01:21:53.442 --> 01:21:59.648
* Although you know
the snow will follow

01:21:59.682 --> 01:22:05.388
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

01:22:05.421 --> 01:22:11.594
* Without a hurt
the heart is hollow

01:22:11.627 --> 01:22:17.466
* Deep in December,
it's nice to remember

01:22:17.500 --> 01:22:23.039
* The fire of September
that made us mellow

01:22:24.540 --> 01:22:31.514
* Deep in December,
our hearts should remember

01:22:33.382 --> 01:22:35.318
* And follow

01:22:36.305 --> 01:22:42.379
