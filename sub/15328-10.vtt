of James' ridiculous scams.

10:20.911 --> 10:22.872
- Mm-hmm, which we're sick of.

10:22.955 --> 10:26.042
So, we are gonna turn this one
against him.

10:26.125 --> 10:30.963
We want James to be so unhappy
he bursts into tears, confesses,

10:31.047 --> 10:33.382
and promises
to never scam again.

10:33.466 --> 10:34.258
[laughs]

10:34.342 --> 10:36.093
- You know, good parenting.

10:38.137 --> 10:40.556
- I'm really disappointed
in you both.

10:40.639 --> 10:43.142
I can't believe you didn't
let me in on this sooner.

10:43.225 --> 10:46.270
You know how much I dream
of making James cry.

10:46.354 --> 10:48.439
- This museum is so boring.

10:48.522 --> 10:52.693
When those people got here
this morning they were 12.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.236
You have to use
your suddenly improved English

10:54.320 --> 10:56.655
to say something
to get us out of here.

10:56.739 --> 10:57.740
You're the guest.

10:57.823 --> 10:59.742
They have to give you
anything you want.

10:59.825 --> 11:01.243
- Really?

11:02.078 --> 11:02.953
Excuse.

11:03.037 --> 11:04.914
Mr. Phillips, Lady Phillips.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.875
I would like to court
the daughter you call Gabby.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.585
- What?

11:09.668 --> 11:11.045
- I'm sorry, what now?

11:11.128 --> 11:13.422
- In Glacier Village,
we court at 13.

11:13.506 --> 11:17.802
Not many girls, grab early,
or else goats take.

11:17.885 --> 11:18.886
- Dude!

11:18.969 --> 11:21.764
- Well, we don't want goats
to take.

11:21.847 --> 11:24.100
I'm fine with you courting Gabby
if her father is.

11:24.183 --> 11:25.768
- Well, if it keeps her from
dating those American losers,

11:25.851 --> 11:26.811
I'm in. Gabby?

11:26.894 --> 11:30.398
- Sure, Blitza.
I'll go a'courting. [giggles]

11:30.481 --> 11:31.273
- What?

11:31.357 --> 11:32.942
But--but--but--but--you--you
hate him.

11:33.025 --> 11:34.276
And you hate her dating.

11:34.360 --> 11:36.404
- Well, it's not dating,
it's courting.

11:36.487 --> 11:39.907
Courting has dignity to it.

11:39.990 --> 11:41.200
- Stephanie, fix this.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.868
- I always
defer to your father.

11:42.952 --> 11:45.121
- Since when?

11:45.204 --> 11:47.248
- You know, I've been
reading about Iceland.

11:47.331 --> 11:49.583
And they have this tradition
where the girlfriend's parents

11:49.667 --> 11:52.420
give her $500
to start her courtship

11:52.503 --> 11:54.255
with a shopping spree
at the mall.

11:54.338 --> 11:57.133
- Well,
that doesn't sound right.

11:57.216 --> 11:58.467
- My mistake.

11:58.551 --> 12:01.137
I think it was $600.

12:01.220 --> 12:02.471
- Oh, now I remember.

12:02.555 --> 12:07.017
It was $75, and take it.

12:07.101 --> 12:10.271
- Blitza, let's go a'courting
at the mall.

12:10.354 --> 12:12.606
- Hurrah for Blitza!

12:12.690 --> 12:13.899
- Can I speak to you real quick?

12:13.983 --> 12:16.652
- Not now.
Going to American mall.

12:16.735 --> 12:18.237
- Get over here.

12:19.155 --> 12:21.031
Rudy, what are you doing?

12:21.115 --> 12:24.869
- Didn't you hear?
I'm a'courting.

12:24.952 --> 12:27.496
- Something doesn't
make sense here.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.622
Wait.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.459
Fish smoothies,
this stupid museum.

12:31.542 --> 12:32.626
They know.

12:32.710 --> 12:34.753
They're trying
to teach me a lesson.

12:34.837 --> 12:37.006
Fools.
No one teaches me a lesson.

12:37.089 --> 12:41.260
No one teaches
James Phillips anything!

- ♪

12:44.430 --> 12:46.348

12:47.933 --> 12:51.687
We're not courting,
and you're not from Iceland.

12:51.770 --> 12:52.605
- You know?

12:52.688 --> 12:53.522

12:53.606 --> 12:55.232
I was only in this thing

I know Dad and Steph
are onto me, too.

But if you help me turn it
around and mess with them,

13:04.158 --> 13:07.328
I'll double
what they're paying you.

a long distance relationship.

Yes.

Everybody, meet Stanley.

13:29.308 --> 13:32.228
Hey, why don't
Stanley and Blitza

13:32.311 --> 13:34.563
teach us some of their language?

13:34.647 --> 13:35.856
- Since Blitz
went to the trouble to learn

13:35.940 --> 13:38.609
some of our language, least
we can do is learn some of his.

13:38.692 --> 13:40.319
- Sure. [clears throat]

13:40.402 --> 13:41.904

Hey, foreign man,
go back where you came from.

13:54.124 --> 13:54.917
- That's right.

13:55.000 --> 13:57.920
When in Rome, speak English.

13:58.003 --> 14:01.423
Actually, Stanley,
since you lived in Iceland,

14:01.507 --> 14:02.591
I have a few questions
about some things

14:02.675 --> 14:05.803
my parents
claimed to have looked up.

14:05.886 --> 14:07.137
- Oh, Stanley doesn't--

14:07.221 --> 14:09.139
- No, oh, I'm sure
he doesn't mind.

14:09.223 --> 14:12.810
So, did you drink a lot
of fish smoothies in Iceland?

14:12.893 --> 14:16.313
- I don't remember
fish smoothies.

14:16.397 --> 14:18.857
That sounds disgusting.

14:18.941 --> 14:19.817
- Curious.

14:19.900 --> 14:20.901
- No it isn't.

14:20.985 --> 14:21.944
It's a trend
sweeping the country.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.655
- Yeah. Blitza,
why don't you say something,

14:24.738 --> 14:26.615
and Stanley will translate?

14:26.699 --> 14:29.868
That way we'll learn faster.

14:29.952 --> 14:32.037
- Okay.

14:32.121 --> 14:33.622
I like American hamburger.

14:33.706 --> 14:37.126
You make Icelandic please.

14:37.209 --> 14:38.877
- No, no, no, Blitza.

14:38.961 --> 14:44.675
You make Icelandic first,
then Stanley make American.

14:44.758 --> 14:45.968
- No, no, no.

14:46.051 --> 14:48.762
What I wanna hear
is how Stanley felt

14:48.846 --> 14:50.556
about those icy cold showers

14:50.639 --> 14:51.557
you guys said
Icelandic people take.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.976
- Icy cold showers?

14:54.059 --> 14:54.893
The whole country's
built on geysers.

14:54.977 --> 14:58.564
The taps are labeled
hot and hotter.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.652
- Mm, that does not line up
with what my parents told me.

15:03.736 --> 15:06.155
- Okay, that's enough.

15:06.238 --> 15:09.658
Somebody in this room
has never been to Iceland

15:09.742 --> 15:13.704
and needs to fess up.

15:13.787 --> 15:17.416
- Okay, it's me!

15:17.499 --> 15:19.752
When I met Maggie, she said
she liked interesting men.

15:19.835 --> 15:21.295
And then they rang the bell
at speed dating,

15:21.378 --> 15:22.671
so I had to say something.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.672
I wasn't interesting.

15:23.756 --> 15:24.757
I drove a bus.

15:24.840 --> 15:26.133
So I blurted out
that I used to live in Iceland.

15:29.261 --> 15:30.804
- Stanley!

15:32.765 --> 15:37.519
I don't mind a man
driving a bus.

15:37.603 --> 15:40.522
But lying...

15:40.606 --> 15:43.192
actually, I don't mind
the lying either.

15:43.275 --> 15:48.364
Oooh. Come on, let's just
get some fro-yo.

15:48.447 --> 15:51.325
- Well, I'm glad we finally
cleared up the mystery

15:51.408 --> 15:53.369
on who's Icelandic
and who's not.

15:53.452 --> 15:55.788
So, Liberty Fun Park
first thing in the morning.

15:55.871 --> 15:58.290
Come on, Blitz, let's skip
dinner so we have more room

15:58.374 --> 15:59.124
for a deep-fried breakfast.

16:04.463 --> 16:05.881
- Well, that didn't work.

16:05.964 --> 16:08.258
I wish he was
an exchange student

16:08.342 --> 16:11.136
so we could send him
back to Iceland.

16:11.220 --> 16:13.889
- Charlie. You're a genius.

16:13.972 --> 16:14.890
Let's do it.

16:14.973 --> 16:17.476
Let's ship him off!

16:17.559 --> 16:19.144
- I do have a crate his size
out in the garage.

16:19.228 --> 16:21.021
- Oh, Charlie, we're not
putting him in a crate.

16:21.105 --> 16:24.233
We're buying a plane ticket,
and telling James

16:24.316 --> 16:26.652
we're sending Blitz
back to Iceland.

16:26.735 --> 16:28.195
Call his bluff.

16:28.278 --> 16:29.196
- I'm in.

16:29.279 --> 16:30.239
- Wait.

16:30.322 --> 16:32.783
Why do you have
a boy-sized crate?

16:32.866 --> 16:36.578
- Because James
is a lot of trouble.

so we have to leave early.

16:46.213 --> 16:46.880

for the airport.

16:46.964 --> 16:48.090

were sending him back,

16:50.676 --> 16:51.760
he didn't want to bother you,

16:51.844 --> 16:56.265
so he took his ticket
from the drawer and left.

16:56.348 --> 16:57.307

16:57.391 --> 16:58.517

put him on a plane?

was contact the school.

no student exchange program.

- Rudy, your dad is waiting
in the living room.

19:47.686 --> 19:49.605
He'd like to hear
about the totally normal time

19:49.688 --> 19:52.733
you had with James'
well-adjusted parents.

19:52.816 --> 19:55.527
- Mr. and Mrs. Phillips,
thank you for your hospitality.

19:55.611 --> 19:57.446
James, sorry it didn't work out.

19:57.529 --> 19:58.947
Gabby, can I keep your--

19:59.031 --> 20:00.282
- Whatever you took,
I don't wanna touch again.

20:04.077 --> 20:07.956
- So, is this insane thing that
never happened finally over?

20:08.040 --> 20:08.874
- Hold on.

20:08.957 --> 20:11.335
James, I need that ticket
to Iceland back.

20:11.418 --> 20:12.461
It's refundable.

20:12.544 --> 20:14.838
- Was refundable.
- [laughing]

20:14.922 --> 20:16.548
- Uh, Gabby, here's your cut.
- Mm-hmm.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.674
- That's our money.
We paid for that.

20:17.758 --> 20:23.263
- Paid for what?

20:23.347 --> 20:25.807
None of this ever happened.

20:29.102 --> 20:29.353
- ♪

20:32.147 --> 20:36.151
- ♪
