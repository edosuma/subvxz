WEBVTT

00:06.301 --> 00:08.237
Why won't she tell us
what it's about?

00:08.270 --> 00:09.572
I have no idea.

00:11.106 --> 00:13.242
Have we broken any rules
or anything?

00:13.275 --> 00:14.409
Oh, not that I'm aware of.

00:14.443 --> 00:16.277
I've never even appeared
before this judge.

00:16.311 --> 00:18.047
Neither have I.
(door opens)

00:20.850 --> 00:22.517
Sorry to keep you waiting,
gentlemen.

00:22.552 --> 00:24.053
Thank you for coming.

00:25.520 --> 00:28.591
I'll, uh, skip the pleasantries
and get right to it.

00:29.291 --> 00:30.693
Lawrence O'Malley.

00:30.726 --> 00:31.727
You've heard of him.

00:31.761 --> 00:33.328
We read the papers.

00:33.362 --> 00:36.165
Excellent.
Then you're halfway up to speed.

00:36.198 --> 00:39.101
You obviously know he thinks
he's Hannibal Lecter.

00:39.134 --> 00:41.036
Tomorrow's papers
will be covering his need

00:41.070 --> 00:41.971
for new counsel,

00:42.004 --> 00:44.173
which is where you come in.

00:44.206 --> 00:45.474
You're it.

00:46.942 --> 00:47.910
I beg your pardon?

00:47.943 --> 00:50.145
COOKE: His lawyer fell out.

00:50.179 --> 00:51.981
There will be no continuance
for Mr. O'Malley.

00:52.014 --> 00:53.215
The trial will start

00:53.248 --> 00:54.850
the day after tomorrow,

00:54.884 --> 00:57.687
which means I need seasoned
criminal-defense attorneys

00:57.720 --> 00:59.054
who can jump in--
Hold on a second.

00:59.088 --> 01:00.923
COOKE: The files are being
delivered to your office

01:00.956 --> 01:02.858
as we speak.
You can't just assign us--

01:02.892 --> 01:05.194
COOKE: What you need to know
about the judge, Mr. Donnell,

01:05.227 --> 01:07.529
is that she doesn't like
to be interrupted.

01:09.732 --> 01:11.701
The trial starts on Tuesday.

01:11.734 --> 01:13.869
You will be his lawyer.

01:13.903 --> 01:16.005
In fact, I'm assigning
your entire firm to it

01:16.038 --> 01:17.472
to ensure the bastard
doesn't have

01:17.506 --> 01:18.841
any inadequate
counsel appeals.

01:18.874 --> 01:20.309
What about our other cases?

01:20.342 --> 01:23.112
We have--
I'll write you a note.

01:23.145 --> 01:24.780
Sorry to do this, boys,

01:24.814 --> 01:27.349
but your reputation
speaks for itself.

01:27.382 --> 01:29.752
I need good lawyers
who can jump in on a dime.

01:29.785 --> 01:31.687
What happened
to his other lawyer?

01:33.222 --> 01:34.790
There was a conflict.

01:36.892 --> 01:38.894
Your client bit off
his nose.

01:43.365 --> 01:46.468
(music playing)

02:36.652 --> 02:37.553
The whole firm?

02:37.587 --> 02:38.854
Who is this judge?

02:38.888 --> 02:41.223
Look, let's not waste time
talking about the judge.

02:41.256 --> 02:43.559
It is what it is. We have
to get ready for the trial.

02:43.593 --> 02:44.827
Starting Tuesday?

02:44.860 --> 02:46.729
DONNELL: Helen Gamble is the
D. A., so we at least don't need

02:46.762 --> 02:48.731
scouting reports
on the prosecution.

02:48.764 --> 02:50.766
Eugene and I will meet
with the client tonight.

02:50.800 --> 02:52.935
Ellenor, I need you and Bec
to meet with psychiatrists

02:52.968 --> 02:53.969
first thing in the morning.

02:54.003 --> 02:55.705
So we're going insanity?

02:55.738 --> 02:57.940
DONNELL: Yes. Lindsay,
I'd like you and Jimmy

02:57.973 --> 02:59.241
to meet with his former lawyer.

02:59.274 --> 03:02.044
He's at Mass General
in good condition.

03:02.077 --> 03:03.813
BERLUTI: The guy really thinks
he's Hannibal Lecter?

03:03.846 --> 03:05.447
That seems to be the question.

03:05.480 --> 03:07.683
The prosecution thinks
he's faking.

03:08.884 --> 03:10.319
Eugene, we should go.

03:15.490 --> 03:18.260
He's shackled,
straitjacket, muzzled.

03:18.293 --> 03:19.161
I think you'll be okay.

03:19.194 --> 03:20.730
Has he been fed?

03:20.763 --> 03:21.997
Is that a joke?

03:22.031 --> 03:23.899
We don't find your guy
too funny, counsel.

03:26.468 --> 03:27.670
You want a guard
in there or not?

03:27.703 --> 03:29.104
Up to you.

03:32.642 --> 03:34.109
No. We'll be okay.

03:41.316 --> 03:44.253
(music playing)

03:49.692 --> 03:52.194
I'm Bobby Donnell,
this is Eugene Young,

03:52.227 --> 03:54.163
appointed by the court
to represent you.

03:55.430 --> 03:57.232
The judge refused
to continue the case.

03:57.266 --> 03:59.134
She evidently didn't want
to reward you

03:59.168 --> 04:01.236
for biting off body parts.

04:01.270 --> 04:03.005
That means we go
day after tomorrow,

04:03.038 --> 04:05.240
which means we
have a lot to do.

04:09.612 --> 04:11.947
We're going to need
your full cooperation.

04:13.783 --> 04:15.217
What's your name?

04:20.690 --> 04:22.725
Did you miss the part
about full cooperation?

04:23.826 --> 04:24.894
What's your name?

04:28.964 --> 04:30.332
My name is listed

04:30.365 --> 04:32.635
in the indictment.

04:32.668 --> 04:34.670
I assume the question
is designed to elicit

04:34.704 --> 04:36.539
what I think my name is

04:36.572 --> 04:38.641
to give you some sense
of whether I'm sane.

04:40.042 --> 04:42.111
I suggest you take it up
with the doctors.

04:42.144 --> 04:44.179
All right. Look,
let's not waste time with you

04:44.213 --> 04:46.015
trying to prove
you're smarter than me.

04:46.782 --> 04:48.684
You're in prison, I'm not.

04:48.718 --> 04:49.952
You're sitting there shackled,

04:49.985 --> 04:52.321
wearing a muzzle, I'm not.

04:52.354 --> 04:54.356
You're the one who could be
spending the rest of his life

04:54.389 --> 04:56.692
in prison.

04:56.726 --> 04:58.427
Do you know your name?

05:00.930 --> 05:02.164
Lean in closer.

05:02.197 --> 05:03.933
Just tell me.

05:04.867 --> 05:06.636
My name is Hannibal Lecter.

05:09.872 --> 05:11.641
You plan to argue insanity?

05:12.407 --> 05:14.710
DONNELL: You murdered
and ate three people,

05:14.744 --> 05:17.146
Mr. Lecter.

05:17.179 --> 05:19.014
Insanity seems to be
our best bet.

05:19.048 --> 05:21.450
I didn't kill them.

05:21.483 --> 05:23.252
The other man killed them.

05:23.285 --> 05:24.720
What other man?

05:27.723 --> 05:29.324
What other man?

05:38.801 --> 05:40.235
The doctors think basically

05:40.269 --> 05:41.937
he created this man
in his head

05:41.971 --> 05:43.172
for the murders themselves.

05:43.205 --> 05:44.740
He's never denied

05:44.774 --> 05:46.075
consuming the victims,

05:46.108 --> 05:47.843
but it's always
the other persona

05:47.877 --> 05:48.978
who stabbed the girls.

05:49.011 --> 05:50.345
What's the diagnosis?

05:50.379 --> 05:53.015
It's all over the map.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.117
One of my doctors says,
paranoid schizophrenia,

05:55.150 --> 05:58.053
another says,
psychotic disorder.

05:58.087 --> 06:00.489
The prosecution experts say,

06:00.522 --> 06:02.024
he's faking it,

06:02.057 --> 06:03.358
that he stabbed the girls

06:03.392 --> 06:05.595
and he ate them to give himself
an insanity defense,

06:05.628 --> 06:07.296
should he ever get caught.

06:07.329 --> 06:08.497
BERLUTI: It would convince me.

06:08.531 --> 06:09.632
What do you think?

06:10.966 --> 06:13.335
Look, to do what he's done,

06:14.604 --> 06:16.739
obviously there's some severe

06:16.772 --> 06:18.941
mental deficit here.

06:18.974 --> 06:20.242
Is he criminally insane?

06:20.275 --> 06:22.444
Did he not understand that
what he was doing was wrong?

06:23.579 --> 06:24.513
I don't know.

06:24.547 --> 06:26.716
All I am sure of,

06:26.749 --> 06:29.552
he's as crazy as he may be.

06:29.585 --> 06:31.220
He is not stupid.

06:32.121 --> 06:34.389
Don't ever think

06:34.423 --> 06:36.892
you're in charge of him,
Ms. Dole.

06:36.926 --> 06:38.861
I promise you,

06:38.894 --> 06:40.696
he'll be in control of you.

06:45.034 --> 06:47.436
FRUTT: One of the psychiatrists
had him take a polygraph

06:47.469 --> 06:48.571
He passed.

06:48.604 --> 06:50.505
Said he was Hannibal Lecter,
said another guy

06:50.540 --> 06:52.507
killed the girls.

06:52.542 --> 06:53.976
He passed the lie detector

06:54.009 --> 06:55.110
with flying colors.

06:55.144 --> 06:57.146
He could also describe
the killings.

06:57.179 --> 06:59.414
It was basically like
he stepped outside of himself

06:59.448 --> 07:01.183
and was watching somebody
else do it.

07:01.216 --> 07:03.786
And then he would step back
into himself to...

07:03.819 --> 07:05.855
Eat them.

07:05.888 --> 07:08.457
DOLE: And the police think
he's faking because?

07:08.490 --> 07:09.825
EUGENE: He has a 9:00
to 5:00 job.

07:09.859 --> 07:11.961
He punches in every day
as Lawrence O'Malley,

07:11.994 --> 07:13.362
pays his bills on time.

07:13.395 --> 07:14.764
Are they offering anything?

07:14.797 --> 07:16.365
Life in prison.

07:16.398 --> 07:19.201
The client turned it down.
I guess he's not that crazy.

07:19.234 --> 07:21.236
FRUTT: So what?
Are we all gonna try this?

07:21.270 --> 07:22.404
Lindsay, I'd like you to open.

07:22.437 --> 07:23.906
Women victims,
let's put a woman

07:23.939 --> 07:25.274
on the face of our defense.

07:25.307 --> 07:26.809
Jimmy, you take the lawyer.

07:26.842 --> 07:28.043
We're gonna call him?

07:28.077 --> 07:29.111
DONNELL: Probably first.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.813
Ellenor, Bec,
you got the doctors.

07:30.846 --> 07:32.715
Eugene and I will take
the prosecution witnesses.

07:32.748 --> 07:35.651
HATCHER: Bobby, a Mr. and Mrs.
O'Malley are here.

07:35.685 --> 07:36.819
DONNELL: Who?

07:36.852 --> 07:38.320
Hannibal's parents.

07:40.590 --> 07:43.559
He would make up
fictitious characters

07:43.593 --> 07:44.927
and assume their identities.

07:44.960 --> 07:48.363
I think it made him
feel stronger.

07:48.397 --> 07:50.232
He started pretending
he was Hannibal Lecter

07:50.265 --> 07:53.736
about 10 years ago shortly
after the movie came out,

07:53.769 --> 07:56.005
probably so that...

07:56.038 --> 07:57.773
he could feel dangerous.

07:59.675 --> 08:01.611
And at some point,

08:03.145 --> 08:05.447
he really thought he was.

08:05.480 --> 08:06.616
MICHAEL: Mr. Donnell,

08:06.649 --> 08:08.951
Lawrence would never do

08:08.984 --> 08:10.586
these things.

08:10.620 --> 08:13.155
We want you to hear that
from his parents.

08:13.188 --> 08:15.224
This is some sort of insanity,

08:15.257 --> 08:17.793
but Lawrence,

08:17.827 --> 08:20.462
he is not a killer.

08:20.495 --> 08:22.898
He took his knife

08:22.932 --> 08:25.635
and he gutted her

08:25.668 --> 08:27.069
like he was...

08:27.102 --> 08:28.938
cleaning a fish.

08:28.971 --> 08:30.973
MAN (on TV): Who did?

08:31.006 --> 08:33.808
The other man.

08:33.842 --> 08:35.645
She didn't die right away.

08:38.179 --> 08:39.649
DONNELL: Okay Look,

08:39.682 --> 08:42.585
we have to make a decision here
on the restraints.

08:42.618 --> 08:44.053
He's gonna look
like a monster

08:44.086 --> 08:45.354
if he's shackled and muzzled.

08:45.387 --> 08:46.488
I'm not sitting next to him.

08:46.521 --> 08:48.457
He attacked
his last lawyer, Bobby.

08:48.490 --> 08:49.291
DONNELL: We can petition
the court to keep him

08:49.324 --> 08:50.525
out of the room.

08:50.560 --> 08:52.294
WASHINGTON: And I say
let him look like a monster.

08:52.327 --> 08:54.964
Our strategy here isn't to make
him feel relatable.

08:54.997 --> 08:57.232
Juries don't acquit
monsters, Rebecca.

08:57.266 --> 08:59.201
First thing they teach us
in law school,

08:59.234 --> 09:00.636
monsters lose.

09:02.972 --> 09:05.908
(overlapping chatter)

09:11.346 --> 09:13.215
GAMBLE: Anybody
who would take the lives

09:13.248 --> 09:14.449
of three young women

09:14.483 --> 09:16.418
then cannibalize them

09:16.451 --> 09:18.588
has to have a little
insanity going on.

09:19.789 --> 09:22.291
But did Mr. O'Malley

09:22.324 --> 09:24.694
understand the nature
and quality

09:24.727 --> 09:26.395
of his acts?

09:26.428 --> 09:27.563
Did he know

09:27.597 --> 09:30.432
what he was doing was wrong?

09:31.567 --> 09:32.735
Of course he did.

09:33.435 --> 09:35.671
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evidence will show

09:35.705 --> 09:38.040
he tried to conceal his crimes.

09:38.073 --> 09:40.776
He tried to avoid
getting caught.

09:40.810 --> 09:42.545
Why?

09:42.578 --> 09:44.246
Because he knew it was wrong.

09:45.815 --> 09:48.250
This man acted knowingly,

09:48.283 --> 09:50.185
reflectively,

09:50.219 --> 09:51.286
and methodically.

09:52.221 --> 09:53.989
He'd go to the same bar,

09:54.023 --> 09:55.725
select a victim,

09:55.758 --> 09:57.226
hit on her,

09:57.259 --> 09:59.494
then when rebuffed,

09:59.528 --> 10:01.396
follow her,

10:01.430 --> 10:03.198
abduct her,

10:03.232 --> 10:05.735
stab her to death,

10:05.768 --> 10:07.402
then eat her.

10:08.771 --> 10:10.205
DOLE: None of us can fathom

10:10.239 --> 10:11.373
what must be happening

10:11.406 --> 10:13.743
in Lawrence O'Malley's brain.

10:13.776 --> 10:15.645
To fillet three women

10:15.678 --> 10:17.212
with a knife,

10:17.246 --> 10:19.248
to consume them.

10:19.281 --> 10:21.551
This is not
how sane people behave.

10:22.685 --> 10:24.419
As this trial goes forward,

10:24.453 --> 10:25.921
you're gonna look at this man
sitting over there

10:25.955 --> 10:27.322
and probably
wonder to yourselves

10:27.356 --> 10:28.924
whether he's even human.

10:28.958 --> 10:29.992
You might look at me

10:30.025 --> 10:31.727
and the other lawyers
defending him

10:31.761 --> 10:33.663
and have questions
about our humanity.

10:33.696 --> 10:35.731
How can we defend
such a monster?

10:35.765 --> 10:37.733
Well, our judicial system

10:37.767 --> 10:39.201
is about many things.

10:39.234 --> 10:40.803
What it's first
and foremost about

10:40.836 --> 10:42.605
is protecting society's weakest

10:42.638 --> 10:44.339
and most vulnerable members.

10:45.440 --> 10:47.943
Lawrence O'Malley is severely,

10:47.977 --> 10:49.879
severely mentally ill.

10:51.313 --> 10:52.281
The evidence we present to you

10:52.314 --> 10:54.784
will establish
this convincingly.

10:54.817 --> 10:56.018
You'll want to ignore it

10:56.051 --> 10:58.487
because you're human.

10:58.520 --> 10:59.789
Your sympathy for the victims,

10:59.822 --> 11:01.256
your hatred for our client

11:01.290 --> 11:03.158
will make you want
to ignore or deny

11:03.192 --> 11:05.327
what the doctors tell you.

11:05.360 --> 11:07.462
But as jurors,
you have an obligation

11:07.496 --> 11:09.198
to weigh the evidence.

11:09.231 --> 11:10.499
That's your duty.

11:10.533 --> 11:11.967
That's why you're here.

11:12.935 --> 11:14.670
And the evidence will tell you,

11:14.704 --> 11:17.339
Lawrence O'Malley is insane.

11:21.443 --> 11:24.379
(music playing)

11:34.957 --> 11:36.091
DETECTIVE: We'd had
so many complaints

11:36.125 --> 11:38.093
about how bad the house smelled,

11:38.127 --> 11:40.229
we finally sent
an officer out there.

11:40.262 --> 11:41.396
He took one step inside

11:41.430 --> 11:43.132
and recognized the odor

11:43.165 --> 11:45.300
to be decomposing remains.

11:45.334 --> 11:48.237
We obtained a search warrant,
went to the premises,

11:48.270 --> 11:50.806
and quickly found
three bodies in the basement

11:50.840 --> 11:53.576
in different stages
of decomposition.

11:53.609 --> 11:55.510
Was anybody else there,
detective?

11:55.545 --> 11:57.179
The defendant.

11:57.212 --> 11:59.081
He kept saying,
"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."

11:59.114 --> 12:01.383
That's pretty much all he said
at the house.

12:01.416 --> 12:02.517
"I'm sorry."

12:02.552 --> 12:03.586
GAMBLE: Now, and you said
the bodies

12:03.619 --> 12:05.220
were in different stages.

12:05.254 --> 12:07.389
DETECTIVE:
One was basically skeletal.

12:07.422 --> 12:10.059
The other two were carcasses.

12:10.092 --> 12:12.628
It was extremely gruesome.

12:12.662 --> 12:14.630
Detective,

12:14.664 --> 12:16.331
did you find anything else?

12:16.365 --> 12:17.867
There was a freezer

12:17.900 --> 12:20.870
which contained frozen meat,

12:20.903 --> 12:22.037
human meat.

12:24.373 --> 12:27.342
GAMBLE: Now, you later
interrogated Mr. O'Malley

12:27.376 --> 12:29.211
at the police station,
did you not?

12:29.244 --> 12:31.714
DETECTIVE: Yes, where he
described each of the killings

12:31.747 --> 12:33.148
in detail.

12:33.182 --> 12:34.784
According to the coroner,

12:34.817 --> 12:36.852
the descriptions were accurate.

12:36.886 --> 12:38.520
Thank you, detective.

12:40.890 --> 12:43.125
You asked my client his name?

12:43.158 --> 12:44.126
DETECTIVE: Yes.

12:44.159 --> 12:45.294
What did he tell you?

12:45.327 --> 12:48.230
He said his name
was Hannibal Lecter.

12:48.263 --> 12:49.599
Did he say
he killed the women?

12:49.632 --> 12:51.400
DETECTIVE: No.
He claims he witnessed

12:51.433 --> 12:52.902
the other man do it.

12:52.935 --> 12:54.403
He just...

12:54.436 --> 12:55.905
called him the other man.

12:55.938 --> 12:58.107
The same other man
for all three murders?

12:58.140 --> 12:59.508
DETECTIVE: Yes.

12:59.542 --> 13:00.910
Did he describe the other man?

13:00.943 --> 13:02.411
Yes.

13:02.444 --> 13:03.478
The description he gave

13:03.512 --> 13:05.314
pretty much matched himself.

13:06.649 --> 13:08.751
He would be at the bar
three nights a week, easy.

13:08.784 --> 13:11.020
Do you specifically remember

13:11.053 --> 13:12.187
the defendant?

13:12.221 --> 13:14.223
MR. WILLIAMS: Oh, yes. He was
too weird not to remember.

13:14.256 --> 13:16.726
I served him many nights,
and I never heard him speak.

13:16.759 --> 13:18.427
Did you ever see him speak?

13:18.460 --> 13:20.395
MR. WILLIAMS: To women I did.

13:20.429 --> 13:22.565
He was always trying
to talk up women.

13:22.598 --> 13:24.233
I never saw him
have success.

13:24.266 --> 13:26.501
Did you ever see
Mr. O'Malley

13:26.536 --> 13:28.904
talk to any of these women?

13:28.938 --> 13:31.140
I know I saw him talking
to the first girl,

13:31.173 --> 13:32.942
and I remember the look
on her face.

13:32.975 --> 13:35.845
It was like,
"Get this kook away from me."

13:35.878 --> 13:38.881
DONNELL: You used the words
strange, weird, kook,

13:38.914 --> 13:41.684
based on your observations
of my client, Mr. Williams,

13:41.717 --> 13:43.553
he seemed nuts?
GAMBLE: Objection.

13:43.586 --> 13:45.420
Lay opinion.
I'll allow it.

13:45.454 --> 13:46.421
You may answer.

13:46.455 --> 13:47.823
He seemed very nuts.

13:47.857 --> 13:49.959
DONNELL: And he would come in
three nights a week

13:49.992 --> 13:50.893
on average?

13:50.926 --> 13:51.894
Yes.

13:51.927 --> 13:53.328
He would, uh, try to talk

13:53.362 --> 13:54.463
to women sometimes.

13:54.496 --> 13:56.532
Other nights he'd just sit
at the bar,

13:56.566 --> 13:57.900
sometimes motionless

13:57.933 --> 13:59.301
like he was in this trance,

13:59.334 --> 14:01.971
just staring straight ahead.

14:02.004 --> 14:03.438
Uh, the guy wasn't right.

14:14.483 --> 14:16.385
We don't need that.

14:16.418 --> 14:18.888
Scaring the jury
doesn't help us here, Lawrence.

14:18.921 --> 14:21.223
Just sit there
and be a passive monster.

14:21.256 --> 14:24.193
Can you do that, please?

14:24.226 --> 14:26.295
All right, look,
the facts are pretty much in.

14:26.328 --> 14:29.198
The rest of the trial
goes to the insanity issue.

14:29.231 --> 14:31.266
The big decision for us
is whether or not

14:31.300 --> 14:32.802
to let you testify.

14:32.835 --> 14:34.269
EUGENE: We'd like
to put you up there,

14:34.303 --> 14:36.338
but we can't,
if we think you'll strike

14:36.371 --> 14:37.607
terror in people.

14:37.640 --> 14:38.608
Hmm.

14:38.641 --> 14:40.109
(door opens)

14:40.142 --> 14:42.077
Forbes is here.

14:42.111 --> 14:43.345
Jimmy's prepping him.

14:43.378 --> 14:45.214
DONNELL: Okay.

14:45.247 --> 14:46.181
We'll lead with him

14:46.215 --> 14:48.117
and then go with the doctors.

14:48.150 --> 14:50.152
I'd like to talk to her,
please.

14:50.185 --> 14:51.120
Who?

14:51.153 --> 14:54.924
Her, my attorney.

14:54.957 --> 14:57.392
The one who delivered
the eloquent opening about me

14:57.426 --> 14:59.962
being one of society's most...

14:59.995 --> 15:02.932
vulnerable members.

15:02.965 --> 15:05.000
Please...

15:05.034 --> 15:07.436
sit.

15:07.469 --> 15:10.573
(music playing)

15:17.279 --> 15:19.214
Hello, Clarissa.
Oh, brother.

15:19.248 --> 15:21.250
LAWRENCE:
Could you leave, Bobby?

15:21.283 --> 15:23.085
I'd like to speak
with Clarissa alone.

15:23.118 --> 15:25.855
I'm not Clarissa, Lawrence.

15:25.888 --> 15:28.023
Jodie Foster
wasn't even Clarissa.

15:28.057 --> 15:29.592
She was Clarice,

15:29.625 --> 15:31.594
and even she's not
Clarice anymore.

15:34.263 --> 15:36.532
Do they know?

15:36.566 --> 15:38.868
Does Bobby know?

15:39.969 --> 15:41.170
Does he know what?

15:42.004 --> 15:43.773
That you're in love with me.

15:47.877 --> 15:49.745
I think he might be faking.

15:49.779 --> 15:52.181
Hannibal Lecter,
isn't that a little too pat?

15:52.214 --> 15:54.917
We'll let the prosecution
argue that.

15:54.950 --> 15:55.951
Experts ready?

15:55.985 --> 15:57.486
Oh, they're ready
and convincing.

15:57.519 --> 15:59.221
They don't think
he's faking at all.

15:59.254 --> 16:00.422
EUGENE: Jimmy?

16:00.455 --> 16:01.891
Forbes is set.

16:03.525 --> 16:05.260
What about the muzzle?

16:05.294 --> 16:06.996
I think it should come off.

16:07.029 --> 16:08.097
DONNELL: We'll take
the muzzle off

16:08.130 --> 16:09.431
when he testifies.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.802
We need to get back.

16:14.303 --> 16:17.239
He kept talking
about the other man,

16:17.272 --> 16:19.308
how he watched
the other man stab them.

16:20.375 --> 16:22.912
I would gently remind him,
"Lawrence,

16:22.945 --> 16:24.780
there was no other man.

16:24.814 --> 16:26.248
The other man is you."

16:26.281 --> 16:28.150
He never liked that.

16:28.183 --> 16:29.919
He'd ask me to please not say

16:29.952 --> 16:30.920
he was the killer.

16:30.953 --> 16:34.123
Mr. Forbes,
why did you remind him?

16:34.156 --> 16:36.559
FORBES: Well,
we were about to start trial.

16:36.592 --> 16:38.227
I had to prepare him
for things

16:38.260 --> 16:40.863
he was gonna hear
from his own doctors even.

16:40.896 --> 16:42.832
But he just didn't like
hearing that,

16:42.865 --> 16:45.034
that he was the killer.

16:45.067 --> 16:46.936
Friday night,

16:46.969 --> 16:49.071
I reminded him again,

16:49.104 --> 16:50.239
and that was it.

16:50.272 --> 16:51.406
What happened?

16:51.440 --> 16:53.408
He just lunged

16:53.442 --> 16:54.376
like a Rottweiler.

16:54.409 --> 16:55.845
He had me by the nose.

16:55.878 --> 16:58.948
In the course of your
representation of Mr. O'Malley,

16:58.981 --> 17:00.616
what can you tell us
about his mental--

17:00.650 --> 17:02.585
Objection.
He is trying to admit

17:02.618 --> 17:03.719
medical opinions again.

17:03.753 --> 17:05.588
BERLUTI: No, a lay opinion.

17:05.621 --> 17:07.089
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
I will stipulate

17:07.122 --> 17:09.692
the lay opinion
of Mr. O'Malley is he's crazy.

17:09.724 --> 17:12.161
But this witness
has no foundation

17:12.194 --> 17:13.462
to present testimony

17:13.494 --> 17:15.497
on the issue
of legal insanity

17:15.530 --> 17:17.132
as it relates to this trial.

17:17.165 --> 17:19.001
I'm going to agree.

17:19.034 --> 17:21.737
The witness may speak
to the defendant's behavior,

17:21.771 --> 17:24.406
but leave the psychiatric
opinions to the doctors.

17:30.445 --> 17:31.480
Mr. O'Malley,

17:31.513 --> 17:33.082
please take your seat.

17:34.950 --> 17:37.319
Mr. O'Malley--
Your Honor,

17:37.352 --> 17:38.588
at this time I'd ask

17:38.621 --> 17:41.356
that the district attorney
be disqualified.

17:41.390 --> 17:42.491
Why?

17:42.524 --> 17:44.493
She and I have had relations.

17:51.266 --> 17:52.702
It was one of those moments
where time

17:52.735 --> 17:54.103
just seemed to freeze.

17:54.136 --> 17:55.470
Even Helen Gamble herself

17:55.504 --> 17:57.472
seemed momentarily paralyzed.

17:57.506 --> 17:59.742
GAMBLE: Such crap. Well,
what do they expect me to do,

17:59.775 --> 18:02.712
jump up and react?
Stupid media.

18:02.745 --> 18:04.079
Helen, I know we agreed

18:04.113 --> 18:06.181
to never talk shop at home,

18:06.215 --> 18:08.317
but you really should put
something on the table.

18:08.350 --> 18:10.485
It was a stunt, Ellenor,
and you know it.

18:10.519 --> 18:12.454
"Hey, everybody,
look how insane I am."

18:12.487 --> 18:13.689
FRUTT: Could be,

18:13.723 --> 18:15.157
but not many people eat flesh.

18:15.190 --> 18:17.059
The jury's got to think
he's nuts.

18:17.092 --> 18:18.628
Jurors are human.

18:18.661 --> 18:20.395
At their core,
they're vengeful.

18:20.429 --> 18:22.397
I think
you're projecting there.

18:22.431 --> 18:23.966
And when they go back
to deliberate

18:23.999 --> 18:26.902
about what he did
to those women,

18:26.936 --> 18:28.904
compassion won't be winning out.

18:28.938 --> 18:31.473
MAN (on TV): Tomorrow,
the case turns to the doctors,

18:31.506 --> 18:34.076
where both sides
have their experts lined up.

18:34.109 --> 18:37.346
The base illness
is paranoid schizophrenia.

18:37.379 --> 18:38.948
The fixed false belief

18:38.981 --> 18:40.683
is that he's Hannibal Lecter.

18:40.716 --> 18:42.652
FRUTT: And, doctor,
does paranoid schizophrenia

18:42.685 --> 18:44.253
make a person homicidal?

18:44.286 --> 18:45.420
Well, there are no norms.

18:45.454 --> 18:48.423
It doesn't necessarily
make a person dangerous.

18:48.457 --> 18:49.725
It seems with Mr. O'Malley

18:49.759 --> 18:51.594
that when he kills,
he experiences

18:51.627 --> 18:53.028
a psychotic break

18:53.062 --> 18:54.930
from his other reality.

18:54.964 --> 18:56.065
You lost me there.

18:56.098 --> 18:58.033
WOMAN: He becomes
somebody else altogether

18:58.067 --> 19:00.102
when he kills,
the other person.

19:00.135 --> 19:03.472
Then he goes back
to being Mr. Lecter.

19:03.505 --> 19:05.575
Basically, he suffers
from paranoid schizophrenia

19:05.608 --> 19:06.609
always,

19:06.642 --> 19:09.278
and he suffers
from periodic psychosis

19:09.311 --> 19:11.313
on top of that.

19:11.747 --> 19:13.082
GAMBLE: Or he's faking.

19:13.115 --> 19:14.283
WOMAN: I don't believe
he could feign

19:14.316 --> 19:16.485
these kinds of symptoms,
Ms. Gamble.

19:16.518 --> 19:18.654
GAMBLE: Well, doctor,
have you ever known a person

19:18.688 --> 19:20.990
to feign schizophrenia
or psychosis?

19:21.023 --> 19:22.658
Successfully,

19:22.692 --> 19:24.794
it would be extremely rare.

19:24.827 --> 19:26.662
But it can be done

19:26.696 --> 19:28.330
and in my medical opinion,

19:28.363 --> 19:29.832
Mr. O'Malley is doing it here.

19:29.865 --> 19:31.534
Why do you think so?

19:31.567 --> 19:32.602
MAN: Well, for starters,

19:32.635 --> 19:34.704
he's completely functional
as Lawrence O'Malley.

19:34.737 --> 19:36.138
He goes to work,

19:36.171 --> 19:37.840
performs competently there.

19:37.873 --> 19:39.542
None of his co-workers
have ever seen

19:39.575 --> 19:41.043
a sign of Hannibal Lecter.

19:41.076 --> 19:43.145
Well, could he
just be covering it up?

19:43.178 --> 19:44.780
Sure, but why?

19:44.814 --> 19:47.249
If he has no compunction
about being Hannibal Lecter

19:47.282 --> 19:48.584
with the police,

19:48.618 --> 19:51.520
why would he cover it up
with others?

19:51.554 --> 19:54.356
(music playing)

19:54.389 --> 19:55.925
I'm sorry.

20:01.263 --> 20:02.297
I'm sorry.

20:02.331 --> 20:03.733
How many times
do I have to say it?

20:03.766 --> 20:05.200
The guy was looking right at me.

20:05.234 --> 20:06.536
BERLUTI: Look,
it didn't hurt us.

20:06.569 --> 20:08.503
It's not like
we're pretending he's nice.

20:08.538 --> 20:09.805
No, but it doesn't help
if it seems

20:09.839 --> 20:11.874
even we're afraid of him.
WASHINGTON: Oh, come on.

20:11.907 --> 20:13.075
He's tied up
like a rabid dog.

20:13.108 --> 20:15.077
Everyone in that room
is afraid of him.

20:15.110 --> 20:17.379
FRUTT: The problem is
if they think of him as a dog,

20:17.412 --> 20:19.782
crazy or not, they're gonna
wanna put him to sleep.

20:19.815 --> 20:22.051
He has to be
a little sympathetic.

20:22.084 --> 20:24.119
Does he understand that?

20:24.153 --> 20:26.255
I've told him over and over.

20:27.022 --> 20:28.658
I think Lindsay
should take his direct.

20:28.691 --> 20:30.392
Me? You take him.

20:30.425 --> 20:32.628
EUGENE: Look, in a way,
you represent the victims.

20:32.662 --> 20:33.629
Exactly.

20:33.663 --> 20:35.130
EUGENE: He also seems
to be softer with you

20:35.164 --> 20:36.498
than he is with Bobby or me.

20:36.532 --> 20:39.201
Have Jimmy take him. He's good
at bringing out soft sides.

20:39.234 --> 20:41.604
Look, any one of us
could do it.

20:41.637 --> 20:43.238
You'll be the most effective.

20:43.272 --> 20:45.675
His best chance
to be sympathetic is you.

20:55.785 --> 20:58.087
DONNELL: Hey,

20:58.120 --> 21:00.756
you okay?

21:00.790 --> 21:02.124
Yeah.

21:05.460 --> 21:07.262
I can take the direct.

21:07.296 --> 21:08.497
I'm fine.

21:13.368 --> 21:15.004
He really scared you,
didn't he?

21:19.208 --> 21:20.876
The way he looked at me.

21:22.511 --> 21:24.146
I'll tell you this, Bobby,

21:24.179 --> 21:26.448
he's not faking.

21:26.481 --> 21:28.017
I looked into those eyes.

21:28.050 --> 21:29.619
They were the eyes
of insanity.

21:31.186 --> 21:33.522
I may not be a doctor,
but I saw it.

21:34.590 --> 21:36.726
That man is truly crazy.

21:42.898 --> 21:44.800
DOLE: Did you not hear
my question?

21:46.569 --> 21:49.071
Did you know
these women?

21:49.104 --> 21:50.673
I'd met them.

21:50.706 --> 21:52.575
I can't lay claim
to knowing them.

21:52.608 --> 21:54.577
DOLE: You met them
at Hannigan's?

21:54.610 --> 21:56.946
LAWRENCE: Yes,
they weren't particularly

21:56.979 --> 21:58.380
kind to me.

21:58.413 --> 21:59.615
DOLE: Can you tell the court
how you happened

21:59.649 --> 22:01.050
to see them get killed?

22:01.083 --> 22:02.952
Well, on each occasion,

22:02.985 --> 22:04.486
I followed them,

22:04.519 --> 22:06.622
and in the parking lot,

22:06.656 --> 22:09.625
I saw them get abducted
by the other man.

22:09.659 --> 22:12.527
Could you describe
this other man?

22:12.562 --> 22:16.065
LAWRENCE: I never got
a very good look at his face.

22:16.098 --> 22:17.432
He was about 6 feet tall,

22:17.466 --> 22:19.001
lanky.

22:19.034 --> 22:20.435
DOLE: And he abducted
these women

22:20.469 --> 22:21.470
in the parking lot?

22:21.503 --> 22:24.373
Yes. He dragged them
into his car.

22:24.406 --> 22:26.542
I think they liked him,

22:26.576 --> 22:27.743
but for some reason,

22:27.777 --> 22:29.845
they didn't want to go with him.

22:29.879 --> 22:31.947
Okay. And what did you do?

22:31.981 --> 22:33.883
LAWRENCE: I followed.

22:33.916 --> 22:36.085
He drove them
to an abandoned pier

22:36.118 --> 22:37.452
on the harbor,

22:39.388 --> 22:41.724
and he would stab them there

22:41.757 --> 22:43.058
and drive off.

22:44.159 --> 22:45.795
I tried to help

22:45.828 --> 22:48.097
each of them,
but I was always too late.

22:48.130 --> 22:49.131
They were dead.

22:50.232 --> 22:52.201
There was nothing
to be done.

22:53.536 --> 22:54.870
So I ate them.

22:58.407 --> 22:59.508
How did these women end up

22:59.542 --> 23:00.676
in your basement,
Mr. O'Malley?

23:00.710 --> 23:03.012
I drove them there
from the pier.

23:03.045 --> 23:05.480
And, sir,
can you tell the court

23:05.514 --> 23:07.149
why you would eat
these women?

23:07.182 --> 23:09.752
Because they were so beautiful.

23:11.086 --> 23:12.087
Like you.

23:14.123 --> 23:15.758
The book of Genesis tells us

23:15.791 --> 23:17.627
that woman...

23:17.660 --> 23:18.928
came from man.

23:18.961 --> 23:21.496
When man consumes the woman,

23:21.530 --> 23:23.866
it makes him one with her.

23:23.899 --> 23:26.168
And by eating them,

23:26.201 --> 23:28.871
I know they will go to heaven.

23:28.904 --> 23:31.240
Because I am going
to heaven,

23:31.273 --> 23:33.108
then they will go with me.

23:34.810 --> 23:36.812
You'll be going to heaven,

23:36.846 --> 23:37.512
Clarice.

23:37.547 --> 23:40.883
(music playing)

23:43.418 --> 23:45.220
You think my name
is Clarice?

23:49.725 --> 23:51.160
That's all I have.

24:02.137 --> 24:03.973
What did the other man do
with the knife?

24:06.275 --> 24:07.610
I don't know.

24:08.077 --> 24:09.612
Funny how it never turned up,

24:09.645 --> 24:13.082
like it was hidden
or disposed of carefully.

24:13.115 --> 24:16.385
The other man really knew
what he was doing, I guess.

24:16.418 --> 24:18.954
You sucked my fluids
to make me one with you.

24:21.523 --> 24:24.159
How come you never told your
co-workers your real name?

24:24.193 --> 24:26.128
You went to work every day
as Lawrence O'Malley.

24:26.161 --> 24:28.631
You did your job
as Lawrence O'Malley,

24:28.664 --> 24:30.132
collected your paychecks,

24:30.165 --> 24:32.134
paid your income taxes.

24:32.167 --> 24:34.169
You did everything

24:34.203 --> 24:36.872
as Lawrence O'Malley.

24:36.906 --> 24:39.942
Why didn't you tell people
you were really Hannibal Lecter?

24:39.975 --> 24:42.545
It makes it difficult
to invite somebody

24:42.578 --> 24:43.613
over for dinner.

24:43.646 --> 24:44.780
That's clever.

24:44.814 --> 24:46.515
Would you have sexually engaged
with me

24:46.549 --> 24:48.851
had you known
my true identity?

24:48.884 --> 24:51.520
GAMBLE: When you saw
these women murdered

24:51.554 --> 24:54.323
by this other man,

24:54.356 --> 24:55.758
why not go to the police?

24:55.791 --> 24:58.327
I was afraid of being a suspect

24:58.360 --> 24:59.795
since I was there.

24:59.829 --> 25:01.631
GAMBLE: You could have prevented
other women

25:01.664 --> 25:03.165
from being killed.

25:03.198 --> 25:05.668
Surely, you have a conscience,
or do you?

25:05.701 --> 25:08.437
By the time I realized
he was a serial killer,

25:08.470 --> 25:10.906
bodies were in my basement.

25:10.940 --> 25:12.441
I didn't know what to do.

25:12.474 --> 25:15.110
So you just let women continue
to be murdered?

25:15.144 --> 25:16.712
I am trying to help now.

25:16.746 --> 25:17.680
Oh, you're helping now?

25:17.713 --> 25:20.650
Yes. I gave the police
a partial description.

25:20.683 --> 25:22.785
I told them where he kills.

25:22.818 --> 25:24.053
Instead of persecuting me,

25:24.086 --> 25:25.320
you should be looking for him,

25:25.354 --> 25:27.322
especially since...

25:27.356 --> 25:28.991
Since what?

25:30.259 --> 25:33.028
He's planning to kill Clarice.

25:33.062 --> 25:35.731
(overlapping chatter)

25:44.940 --> 25:48.878
(crowd clamoring)

26:01.223 --> 26:02.858
You okay?

26:02.892 --> 26:03.926
Fine.

26:05.227 --> 26:07.162
I thought your direct
went great.

26:07.196 --> 26:08.363
Good to hear.

26:15.437 --> 26:16.872
I don't want to win
this case.

26:16.906 --> 26:19.008
I don't want him going
to state mental facility

26:19.041 --> 26:20.843
that he'll be able
to break out of in a week

26:20.876 --> 26:22.578
Okay.
No!

26:22.612 --> 26:23.746
I went through this
with Hinks.

26:23.779 --> 26:25.480
I don't wanna go
through it again.

26:25.514 --> 26:27.282
I don't wanna win this case.

26:32.755 --> 26:34.289
You should go in there.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.362
Eugene, can I see you
for a second?

26:43.733 --> 26:45.234
This could be nothing.

26:45.267 --> 26:46.969
YOUNG: What?

26:47.002 --> 26:48.470
Jeannie Tanner
is a friend of mine.

26:48.503 --> 26:51.373
She works at the Coroner's
office in Suffolk.

26:51.406 --> 26:53.208
There's an unsolved murder.

26:53.242 --> 26:54.877
Happened seven weeks ago.

26:54.910 --> 26:56.712
28-year-old woman

26:56.746 --> 26:57.613
stabbed to death,

26:57.647 --> 26:59.782
found behind the Marriott.

26:59.815 --> 27:01.951
Last seen alive
at Hannigan's bar.

27:01.984 --> 27:03.518
Seven weeks ago?

27:03.553 --> 27:05.688
Lawrence O'Malley
was in custody.

27:09.324 --> 27:10.993
YOUNG: It's exculpatory evidence

27:11.026 --> 27:11.861
and they held it.

27:11.894 --> 27:13.095
GAMBLE: This is not exculpatory.

27:13.128 --> 27:14.997
It has nothing to do
with the case.

27:15.030 --> 27:15.731
YOUNG: A woman stabbed.

27:15.765 --> 27:17.166
Seen at Hannigan's bar.
Come on.

27:17.199 --> 27:19.068
This was a robbery victim.

27:19.101 --> 27:20.636
The woman was stabbed once.

27:20.670 --> 27:22.304
We should have been told
about it, Helen.

27:22.337 --> 27:23.939
GAMBLE: The state has
no obligation

27:23.973 --> 27:26.709
to inform the defense
of every other homicide.

27:26.742 --> 27:27.577
FRUTT: Oh, please!

27:27.610 --> 27:29.044
This one either fits
the pattern

27:29.078 --> 27:30.746
or comes damn close.
I don't agree.

27:30.780 --> 27:31.781
COOKE: Come on, Ms. Gamble.

27:31.814 --> 27:33.515
It's close enough.

27:33.549 --> 27:35.284
But, counsel,
explain to me the harm.

27:35.317 --> 27:38.120
We may have had another
defense available.

27:38.153 --> 27:39.188
Which is?

27:39.221 --> 27:40.522
YOUNG: Somebody else
is killing these women.

27:40.556 --> 27:42.291
Oh, come on!

27:42.324 --> 27:43.893
My client has always maintained

27:43.926 --> 27:45.360
the other man killed
these girls.

27:45.394 --> 27:47.296
We now have knowledge
of the other man.

27:47.329 --> 27:48.564
You've got to be kidding.

27:48.598 --> 27:49.464
YOUNG: Your Honor...

27:49.498 --> 27:50.766
we should at least be allowed

27:50.800 --> 27:52.902
to change our plea
and argue the elements.

27:52.935 --> 27:54.870
In addition we--
First of all, this is absurd.

27:54.904 --> 27:57.406
Second,
you can't just change a plea.

27:57.439 --> 28:00.209
YOUNG: We got stuck
with this case on Sunday.

28:00.242 --> 28:01.877
Sunday.

28:01.911 --> 28:03.646
Now we find out
the prosecution knew

28:03.679 --> 28:05.548
of another murder
that fits the pattern.

28:05.581 --> 28:07.182
At the very least,
we should be able

28:07.216 --> 28:08.217
to change our plea.

28:08.250 --> 28:10.986
It means one extra witness
on this other killing,

28:11.020 --> 28:12.722
it doesn't inconvenience
the court,

28:12.755 --> 28:14.590
and to deny us this,

28:14.624 --> 28:17.593
you just guarantee
my client an appeal.

28:20.362 --> 28:21.997
Okay.

28:22.031 --> 28:23.699
I'll let you plead
in the alternative--

28:23.733 --> 28:25.034
GAMBLE: I don't believe this.

28:25.067 --> 28:26.201
Ms. Gamble,

28:26.235 --> 28:28.437
you should have revealed
that other murder.

28:28.470 --> 28:30.640
Be glad I don't find misconduct.

28:34.209 --> 28:35.410
How is she doing?

28:35.444 --> 28:36.646
DONNELL: She's okay.

28:36.679 --> 28:38.147
She's a little--

28:39.715 --> 28:40.983
she's okay.

28:41.016 --> 28:43.218
DOLE: I am not okay.

28:43.252 --> 28:44.253
Lindsay.

28:44.286 --> 28:46.321
What's wrong with you?

28:46.355 --> 28:47.690
I'm not okay.

28:47.723 --> 28:49.191
Somebody can beat you
half to death,

28:49.224 --> 28:51.160
and you can go back
to being okay the next day.

28:51.193 --> 28:53.162
You're always okay.

28:53.195 --> 28:54.396
Bobby's okay.

28:54.429 --> 28:55.497
That's how you handle things.

28:55.530 --> 28:56.632
You're okay.

29:02.171 --> 29:03.673
Please don't embarrass me
like that

29:03.706 --> 29:04.707
in front of the office.

29:05.474 --> 29:07.209
Please don't embarrass you?

29:09.812 --> 29:12.447
I got stabbed two years ago.

29:12.481 --> 29:13.749
I got stabbed, Bobby.

29:13.783 --> 29:16.385
A man stuck a knife
into me three times.

29:16.418 --> 29:18.754
I almost died.

29:18.788 --> 29:20.990
And then Hinks stalked me.

29:22.457 --> 29:24.560
I'm not okay.

29:24.594 --> 29:27.296
I have never gone back
to being okay,

29:27.329 --> 29:29.765
no matter how much
that you insist that I have.

29:29.799 --> 29:32.067
I'm just--I'm not okay.

29:32.101 --> 29:35.037
(sobbing)

29:43.112 --> 29:44.914
YOUNG: The cause of death
was stabbing?

29:44.947 --> 29:45.881
That's correct.

29:45.915 --> 29:47.216
YOUNG: And the victim,
Jill Hanover,

29:47.249 --> 29:49.451
was at Hannigan's bar
the night she was killed?

29:49.484 --> 29:50.452
Yes.

29:50.485 --> 29:52.822
YOUNG: Found in an alley
off of Commercial Street

29:52.855 --> 29:53.989
by the harbor,

29:54.023 --> 29:55.324
is that right, detective?

29:55.357 --> 29:57.092
Yes.
YOUNG: And Miss Hanover

29:57.126 --> 29:59.729
was killed on March 26th?

29:59.762 --> 30:00.830
Yes.

30:00.863 --> 30:02.431
YOUNG: And do you have
any leads or suspects

30:02.464 --> 30:03.498
at this time, detective,

30:03.533 --> 30:05.467
relating to this murder?

30:05.500 --> 30:06.969
No, we do not.

30:07.502 --> 30:09.939
Is this killing related
to the three murders

30:09.972 --> 30:12.241
which are the subject
of this trial?

30:12.274 --> 30:13.075
We don't believe so.

30:13.108 --> 30:14.343
GAMBLE: Why not?

30:14.376 --> 30:17.312
Well, Miss Hanover
was stabbed once in the neck.

30:17.346 --> 30:18.948
The other girls
were stabbed multiple times

30:18.981 --> 30:20.482
in the abdomen
and the sternum.

30:20.515 --> 30:23.052
A different knife was used
for Miss Hanover.

30:23.085 --> 30:24.587
The body was also dumped
in an alley

30:24.620 --> 30:27.557
as opposed to being transported
to a basement and consumed.

30:27.590 --> 30:29.524
Miss Hanover
was African-American

30:29.559 --> 30:30.926
and overweight.

30:30.960 --> 30:32.494
These other three victims
were white

30:32.527 --> 30:34.296
with conventionally
attractive figures.

30:34.329 --> 30:37.199
We determined that she
was simply a robbery victim

30:37.232 --> 30:39.001
and that her death
was completely unrelated

30:39.034 --> 30:40.469
to the other three.

30:40.502 --> 30:42.171
Can you prove that, detective?

30:42.204 --> 30:43.773
McGUIRE: Obviously,
we can't prove anything

30:43.806 --> 30:45.975
until we catch
this other suspect.

30:46.008 --> 30:47.376
The other suspect?

30:50.880 --> 30:53.616
MAN: Any chance of calling
other suspects?

30:53.649 --> 30:56.586
(overlapping chatter)

30:58.353 --> 30:59.488
Okay.

30:59.521 --> 31:01.824
Just argue in the alternative,
insanity,

31:01.857 --> 31:04.493
and the possibility
there really is another man.

31:11.601 --> 31:13.836
DONNELL: All right, look,
we have two theories.

31:13.869 --> 31:16.371
They're mutually exclusive,
but the law permits us

31:16.405 --> 31:18.440
to present alternative defenses.

31:18.473 --> 31:20.142
It's risky,
but it's in our interest

31:20.175 --> 31:21.310
to do so here.

31:21.343 --> 31:22.678
Where is Clarice?

31:22.712 --> 31:23.879
Never mind.

31:23.913 --> 31:25.948
Is she all right?

31:25.981 --> 31:27.049
I'm right here.

31:29.585 --> 31:32.054
I'm sorry I frightened you.

31:32.722 --> 31:34.657
If anything ever happened
to you,

31:34.690 --> 31:37.727
you know I'd make sure
you go to heaven.

31:37.760 --> 31:38.861
Hey!

31:38.894 --> 31:40.195
Shut your mouth!

31:40.229 --> 31:42.431
I don't want you talking
to her anymore, you got that?

31:42.464 --> 31:45.635
(music playing)

31:53.308 --> 31:54.844
The fact that
they have thrown in

31:54.877 --> 31:57.947
this 11th-hour theory,

31:57.980 --> 31:59.982
maybe somebody else did it.

32:00.015 --> 32:03.619
That evidence shows
the desperation of the defense,

32:03.653 --> 32:04.887
ladies and gentlemen.

32:05.487 --> 32:08.023
First, he's Hannibal Lecter.

32:08.057 --> 32:10.560
Then, zip,
throw in a psychotic break.

32:10.593 --> 32:11.861
Then, what the hell,

32:11.894 --> 32:13.996
why not let's say
it was another man

32:14.029 --> 32:15.197
after all?

32:17.432 --> 32:20.636
Lawrence O'Malley
brutally stabbed three women

32:20.670 --> 32:23.105
who rejected his advances
at a bar.

32:23.138 --> 32:24.740
It is that simple.

32:24.774 --> 32:27.943
Maybe he is really crazy enough
to eat human flesh,

32:27.977 --> 32:30.412
but we don't let murderers go

32:30.445 --> 32:32.782
because they consume
their victims.

32:33.716 --> 32:35.685
This is a competent,

32:35.718 --> 32:38.053
highly functional man

32:38.087 --> 32:40.089
who went to work every day,

32:40.122 --> 32:43.125
lived a rather normal life,

32:43.158 --> 32:45.561
never flashed Hannibal

32:45.595 --> 32:47.763
or insanity to anybody.

32:48.297 --> 32:49.599
And here...

32:49.632 --> 32:51.000
we see him flashing it

32:51.033 --> 32:53.335
at every turn.

32:53.368 --> 32:56.606
Suddenly, he's standing up
saying he and I had sex.

32:56.639 --> 32:58.941
He's calling his attorney
Clarice.

32:58.974 --> 33:01.176
He bites off a lawyer's nose.

33:01.210 --> 33:03.312
So many sudden acts of insanity

33:03.345 --> 33:07.182
after 40 years without a sign.

33:07.216 --> 33:09.685
It's a little convenient,
don't you think?

33:10.352 --> 33:13.122
He's trying to feign
legal insanity

33:13.155 --> 33:15.691
to get away with his murders.

33:15.725 --> 33:18.327
Three doctors who examined him

33:18.360 --> 33:20.863
testified he's faking.

33:22.097 --> 33:24.934
And he's hoping
you fall for it.

33:24.967 --> 33:27.402
But just in case you don't,

33:28.538 --> 33:31.140
maybe another man did it
after all.

33:31.841 --> 33:33.909
Worth a shot.

33:33.943 --> 33:37.412
He's been laughing at us
this entire trial.

33:37.446 --> 33:39.181
Please...

33:39.214 --> 33:42.652
don't give him
the last laugh.

33:52.427 --> 33:53.696
We put up three doctors

33:53.729 --> 33:55.931
who said he wasn't faking.

33:55.965 --> 33:58.100
They believe he's insane,

33:58.133 --> 34:00.202
a base illness
of paranoid schizophrenia

34:00.235 --> 34:02.504
coupled with psychotic breaks.

34:02.538 --> 34:03.973
You heard
the experts' testimony.

34:04.774 --> 34:07.476
And now we learn
another woman was killed

34:07.509 --> 34:08.744
leaving Hannigan's bar,

34:08.777 --> 34:12.380
killed while Lawrence O'Malley
was in custody.

34:12.414 --> 34:13.583
The police think it's unrelated,

34:13.616 --> 34:15.050
but can they prove it?

34:15.083 --> 34:18.420
You heard Detective McGuire.
They cant.

34:18.453 --> 34:21.223
The state hasn't met
its burden here.

34:21.255 --> 34:23.158
And as a matter of law,

34:23.192 --> 34:25.393
you must acquit.

34:33.135 --> 34:34.402
Ms. Gamble, rebuttal.

34:34.436 --> 34:35.670
YOUNG: Hold on, Your Honor.

34:37.239 --> 34:39.041
We're doing our closing
in tandem.

34:39.074 --> 34:41.577
Mr. Donnell took the first part.

34:43.612 --> 34:44.746
Very well.

34:48.250 --> 34:51.554
YOUNG: The most outstanding
question concerns the 12 of you.

34:52.087 --> 34:55.224
We have a man sitting here
clearly psychotic.

34:55.257 --> 34:56.759
We know he eats people.

34:56.792 --> 34:58.728
He quite possibly kills them.

34:58.761 --> 35:00.395
Nobody...

35:00.429 --> 35:03.365
nobody likes the idea of him
being anywhere

35:03.398 --> 35:07.837
except in a maximum-security
prison.

35:07.870 --> 35:09.504
But we all have
our duties here.

35:09.539 --> 35:11.974
They prosecute, we defend,

35:12.007 --> 35:13.442
and you...

35:13.475 --> 35:15.878
you determine whether guilt
was proven

35:15.911 --> 35:18.213
beyond all reasonable doubt.

35:18.247 --> 35:20.750
The 12 of you
have the nastiest job of all.

35:20.783 --> 35:23.986
Because to execute your duty,

35:24.019 --> 35:27.122
you have to find this man

35:27.156 --> 35:28.390
not guilty,

35:28.423 --> 35:30.760
which, of course,
you don't want to do,

35:30.793 --> 35:32.762
but you must.

35:32.795 --> 35:35.565
The expert testimony
was a wash at best.

35:35.598 --> 35:37.567
They put up doctors
to say he's faking.

35:37.600 --> 35:39.034
We put up just as many

35:39.068 --> 35:41.136
to say the schizophrenia
was real

35:41.170 --> 35:42.972
as was the psychosis.

35:43.005 --> 35:44.039
On the insanity,

35:44.073 --> 35:45.541
there's no escaping doubt

35:45.575 --> 35:47.910
with all the conflicting
opinions.

35:47.943 --> 35:49.278
And as for the other man,

35:49.311 --> 35:51.847
well...

35:51.881 --> 35:54.316
there was another man

35:54.349 --> 35:56.285
who stabbed a girl

35:56.318 --> 35:58.453
leaving Hannigan's bar.

35:58.487 --> 36:00.756
It happened while
Lawrence O'Malley

36:00.790 --> 36:02.257
was in custody.

36:02.291 --> 36:04.493
That means it's possible,

36:04.526 --> 36:06.996
possible things happened

36:07.029 --> 36:09.164
just as Mr. O'Malley claimed.

36:09.198 --> 36:12.167
He followed these girls out
of the bar.

36:12.201 --> 36:13.903
He saw another man
abduct them.

36:13.936 --> 36:16.338
He saw another man stab them,

36:16.371 --> 36:19.074
drive off before...

36:19.108 --> 36:21.010
Mr. O'Malley took the bodies

36:21.043 --> 36:22.912
back to his basement.

36:22.945 --> 36:25.581
And this isn't some
11th-hour theory

36:25.615 --> 36:27.216
we're throwing out
in desperation,

36:27.249 --> 36:28.283
by the way.

36:28.317 --> 36:30.753
The police knew
about this other murder,

36:30.786 --> 36:32.054
and they never told us.

36:32.087 --> 36:33.889
And we must ask ourselves,

36:33.923 --> 36:35.357
"Why?"

36:37.359 --> 36:38.561
Why didn't they tell us?

36:39.629 --> 36:42.598
You've got reasonable doubt
on the insanity.

36:42.632 --> 36:46.268
You've got reasonable doubt
on the killings themselves.

36:46.301 --> 36:48.103
Two very big questions.

36:48.137 --> 36:49.572
The third question,

36:49.605 --> 36:50.773
the biggest.

36:52.207 --> 36:54.276
Are the 12 of you

36:54.309 --> 36:56.278
going to stay true to your oath

36:56.311 --> 36:58.280
and uphold the law?

37:12.327 --> 37:13.162
HATCHER: How'd it go?

37:13.195 --> 37:14.730
WASHINGTON: Jury's got it.

37:16.566 --> 37:17.733
YOUNG: If you didn't want
to close,

37:17.767 --> 37:19.101
why didn't you just say so,
Bobby?

37:19.134 --> 37:20.069
My closing was--

37:20.102 --> 37:20.870
YOUNG: You folded in.
You stood up there--

37:20.903 --> 37:22.004
Back up, Eugene.

37:22.037 --> 37:23.505
Nobody closes like you can,

37:23.539 --> 37:25.374
and that was half-assed
by the numbers.

37:25.407 --> 37:26.709
I said, back up.

37:26.742 --> 37:28.911
All right. Cut it out.
We don't need this.

37:28.944 --> 37:30.512
YOUNG: Look, I don't want
that guy on the street either.

37:30.546 --> 37:31.614
That's not what this is about.

37:31.647 --> 37:33.148
We have a job to do.

37:33.182 --> 37:36.418
Everybody in this room
did their job, even Lindsay.

37:36.451 --> 37:39.054
It was your job
to deliver your best, Bobby,

37:39.088 --> 37:42.024
and you were up and down
in 30 seconds.

37:44.526 --> 37:46.461
What are we?

37:46.495 --> 37:47.296
Huh?

37:47.329 --> 37:49.298
Some clients we try
our hardest for,

37:49.331 --> 37:51.066
others we pull back?

37:54.469 --> 37:56.338
What in the hell are we?

37:56.371 --> 37:59.308
(music playing)

38:26.368 --> 38:27.737
I don't disagree,

38:27.770 --> 38:30.072
but it's his wife, Eugene.

38:34.677 --> 38:38.313
Maybe you don't have
to excuse him because of that.

38:41.416 --> 38:44.119
But I would think
you could understand.

38:49.124 --> 38:51.661
DONNELL: The clerk's office
just called.

38:53.195 --> 38:54.730
They have a verdict.

39:10.946 --> 39:13.048
The defendant will please rise.

39:20.022 --> 39:22.257
Mr. Foreman, the jury
has a unanimous verdict?

39:22.825 --> 39:23.759
Yes, Your Honor.

39:23.793 --> 39:25.194
What say you?

39:25.961 --> 39:27.897
Commonwealth vs.
Lawrence O'Malley

39:27.930 --> 39:31.634
on three counts of murder
in the first degree,

39:31.667 --> 39:34.570
we find the defendant,
Lawrence O'Malley,

39:34.604 --> 39:35.470
not guilty.

39:35.504 --> 39:37.873
(overlapping chatter)

39:37.907 --> 39:41.110
FOREMAN: On three counts
of murder in the second degree,

39:41.143 --> 39:44.213
we find the defendant,
Lawrence O'Malley,

39:44.246 --> 39:45.380
not guilty.

39:45.414 --> 39:46.749
(overlapping chatter)

39:46.782 --> 39:48.450
Straight not guilty?

39:48.483 --> 39:49.752
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
The Commonwealth seeks

39:49.785 --> 39:51.353
to place the defendant
under arrest

39:51.386 --> 39:53.656
for concealing
and consuming human bodies.

39:53.689 --> 39:55.024
Crimes which--
YOUNG: Hold on.

39:55.057 --> 39:56.692
My client was only charged
with murder.

39:56.726 --> 39:59.194
These crimes would be lesser
included offenses.

39:59.228 --> 40:00.596
Double jeopardy would attach.

40:00.630 --> 40:02.031
I agree.

40:02.064 --> 40:03.999
You can't now arrest him
for lesser includeds,

40:04.033 --> 40:04.900
Ms. Gamble.

40:04.934 --> 40:08.337
The defendant has been found
not guilty.

40:08.370 --> 40:09.805
He is free to go.

40:11.073 --> 40:12.908
Please release him
from the restraints.

40:12.942 --> 40:15.911
GAMBLE: Your Honor,
this man is clearly dangerous.

40:15.945 --> 40:17.212
COOKE: Ms. Gamble,
he's been acquitted.

40:17.246 --> 40:18.581
He's free to go.

40:19.982 --> 40:20.616
We're adjourned.

40:20.650 --> 40:21.984
(gavel bangs)

40:34.229 --> 40:36.398
Thank you, Bobby.

40:36.431 --> 40:38.400
Eugene, you were sensational.

40:40.335 --> 40:41.403
Clarice.

40:41.436 --> 40:44.840
(music playing)

40:50.512 --> 40:51.480
REPORTER: Mr. O'Malley,

40:51.513 --> 40:53.248
were you surprised
by the verdict?

40:53.282 --> 40:54.449
LAWRENCE: No, not at all.

40:54.483 --> 40:57.419
(overlapping chatter)

41:02.758 --> 41:03.893
MELANIE (over TV):
To say the least. I mean,

41:03.926 --> 41:05.094
it was--it was
a bit intimidating.

41:05.127 --> 41:06.629
I'm glad it's over.

41:06.662 --> 41:08.731
It wasn't that we thought
he was innocent.

41:08.764 --> 41:10.933
In fact, we all figured him
to be guilty.

41:10.966 --> 41:13.669
We just couldn't get there
beyond reasonable doubt,

41:13.703 --> 41:15.404
not with that other murder.

41:20.209 --> 41:21.410
I'm sorry.

41:23.679 --> 41:26.281
I think it's the way
I handle things.

41:28.918 --> 41:32.788
If I can pretend I'm okay,
then--

41:32.822 --> 41:34.089
so I--

41:42.732 --> 41:44.066
but, Lindsay...

41:47.302 --> 41:48.871
it's not just me.

41:50.172 --> 41:52.642
You never talk about
how you feel.

41:52.675 --> 41:55.845
You keep it all in
until you just explode.

41:58.948 --> 42:01.483
It isn't just me here.

42:02.852 --> 42:04.019
I know.

42:07.790 --> 42:10.593
We both need to do better,
Bobby...

42:13.328 --> 42:16.699
or you and I...

42:16.732 --> 42:18.500
we won't make it.

42:22.237 --> 42:23.472
We won't.

42:36.652 --> 42:37.920
DONNELL: Next on The Practice.

42:37.953 --> 42:39.021
What about using me?

42:39.054 --> 42:40.656
DONNELL:
You will not be used as bait

42:40.690 --> 42:41.824
for a serial killer.

42:41.857 --> 42:43.993
GAMBLE: I need you to testify
against him

42:44.026 --> 42:45.861
to help convince
the judge he's nuts.

42:45.895 --> 42:48.163
MAN: Mr. O'Malley,
you need to come with us please.

42:48.197 --> 42:49.531
Do you remember me, Hannibal?

42:49.565 --> 42:52.535
DOLE: He's a cannibal
and he has made it clear

42:52.568 --> 42:54.103
that he is coming after me.

42:54.704 --> 42:56.872
Rape witness bout to be shaky.

42:56.906 --> 42:58.941
At probable cause
she was pretty convincing.

42:58.974 --> 42:59.809
Third strike, Jerry.

42:59.842 --> 43:01.711
If convicted, you get life.

43:01.744 --> 43:02.878
I got a twin brother.

43:02.912 --> 43:04.547
He gonna pay you a visit.

43:04.580 --> 43:06.215
BERLUTI: We can't put somebody
up there

43:06.248 --> 43:07.650
to commit perjury, Dr. Cochran.

43:07.683 --> 43:09.251
I won't be committing perjury.

43:09.284 --> 43:10.820
We're not going to call you.
Why?

43:10.853 --> 43:13.055
YOUNG: Because if it looks like
you're lying which it will,

43:13.088 --> 43:14.189
that'll hurt him.

43:16.491 --> 43:19.494
(music playing)

43:42.785 --> 43:43.819
WOMAN: You stinker!
