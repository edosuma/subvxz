02:06.210 --> 02:08.920
I THOUGHT WE WERE
PERFECTLY HAPPY.

02:08.960 --> 02:12.340
I NEED YOU TO FIND OUT
EVERYTHING YOU CAN.

02:12.380 --> 02:15.720
WHO THIS KATHERINE
WALSH SKANK IS.

02:15.760 --> 02:18.760
[MALACHY] YES MRS. CHAFE, WE

02:18.800 --> 02:22.600
[JAKE] LOOK I GOTTA SAY,
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR YOU KNOW

02:22.640 --> 02:24.140
SPILLING YOUR HUSBAND ON THE
FLOOR LIKE THAT.

02:24.180 --> 02:25.930
I HAD NO IDEA.
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING A GOOD--

02:25.980 --> 02:29.150
[MALACHY] LOOK, SOMETIMES WHEN
WE DIG INTO CASES LIKE THIS--

02:29.190 --> 02:31.310
[JAKE] IT AIN'T ALWAYS SO
PRETTY, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?

02:31.360 --> 02:33.730
[JANET] I'VE ALREADY
BEEN HUMILIATED.

02:33.780 --> 02:36.950
I JUST NEED TO FIND OUT WHY.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.950
THE WILL ALSO SAID THERE IS
A LETTER IN A SAFE.

02:39.990 --> 02:41.320
THAT WOULD EXPLAIN EVERYTHING.

02:41.370 --> 02:43.370
ARTHUR DIDN'T HAVE A SAFE.

02:43.410 --> 02:46.620
THIS WHOLE THING HAS GOT
BE SOME SORT OF MISTAKE.

02:46.660 --> 02:48.290
[JAKE] RIGHT.

02:49.420 --> 02:52.000
[JANET] OH EXCUSE ME.
MY MOTHER IS LEAVING.

02:52.040 --> 02:55.260
I BETTER GO SAY GOOD-BYE,
AND APOLOGIZE.

02:55.300 --> 02:57.420
[MALACHY] SURE.
[JAKE] TELL HER THAT I--

02:57.470 --> 02:59.930
I'M REALLY SORRY FOR THE PAIN
I'VE CAUSED.

02:59.970 --> 03:01.340
[MALACHY] LEAVE IT.

03:02.350 --> 03:04.970
[MALACHY] SO WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING?

03:05.010 --> 03:06.890
AFFAIR GONE WRONG?

03:06.930 --> 03:08.560
LOVE ENDS IN SUICIDE?

03:08.600 --> 03:11.770
[JAKE] YEAH, WELL WHY DID HE
LEAVE HER ALL THAT MONEY?

03:11.810 --> 03:13.310
[MALACHY] KEEP HER QUIET?

03:13.360 --> 03:14.360
[JAKE] MAYBE.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.990
I'M LITERALLY COVERED IN
ANOTHER MAN.

03:17.030 --> 03:20.030
&lt;♪♪&gt;

03:33.040 --> 03:36.840
[JAKE] HI THERE. ARE YOU
KATHERINE WELSH?

03:36.880 --> 03:39.050
[KATHARINE] YES.
[JAKE] I'M JAKE DOYLE,

03:39.090 --> 03:42.260
THIS IS MY FATHER MALACHY.
WE JUST WANTED TO ASK YOU A FEW
QUESTIONS ABOUT ARTHUR CHAFE.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.300
[KATHARINE] OH, WHAT A MAN.

03:46.140 --> 03:47.100
[MALACHY] EXCUSE ME?

03:47.140 --> 03:48.520
[KATHARINE] THE DONATION.

03:48.560 --> 03:51.810
GIRLS WILL TELL YOU
I WAS WEEPING WHEN WE HEARD
FROM HIS LAWYERS.

03:51.850 --> 03:54.560
[MALACHY] DID YOU KNOW
MR. CHAFE PERSONALLY?

03:54.610 --> 03:56.360
[KATHARINE] NO, I'D NEVER EVEN
HEARD OF HIM.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.820
[JAKE] MAN COMMITS SUICIDE,
LEAVES YOU A HUNDRED THOUSAND
DOLLARS AND

03:58.860 --> 04:00.240
YOU'VE NEVER MET HIM?

04:00.280 --> 04:02.530
[KATHARINE] WELL THE CENTRE
RECEIVES A LOT OF DONATIONS.

04:02.570 --> 04:04.620
SUICIDE?
[JAKE] YEAH.

04:04.660 --> 04:08.450
[KATHARINE] THAT'S AWFUL.
[JAKE] THE WILL NEVER MENTIONED
ANYTHING ABOUT A DONATION.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.460
THE MONEY WAS LEFT
DIRECTLY TO YOU.

04:10.500 --> 04:13.540
[KATHARINE] I'M SORRY, WHO
DID YOU SAY YOU WORKED FOR?

04:13.580 --> 04:15.250
[MALACHY] WE'RE
PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS.

04:15.290 --> 04:16.790
ARTHUR CHAFE'S WIDOW HIRED US

04:16.840 --> 04:19.300
TO FIND OUT WHY ALL THE
MONEY WENT TO YOU.

04:19.340 --> 04:22.260
[KATHARINE] WELL MR. DOYLE
LIKE I SAID, I DIDN'T KNOW
MR. CHAFE PERSONALLY.

04:22.300 --> 04:26.470
BUT WE RECEIVE THOUSANDS
OF DONATIONS EVERY YEAR.

04:26.510 --> 04:28.430
THERE WOULD BE NO REASON
FOR HIM TO SEND THIS MONEY TO ME

04:28.470 --> 04:30.980
UNLESS IT WAS FOR THE CENTRE.

04:31.020 --> 04:32.310
[RYAN] HEY, MOM?

04:32.350 --> 04:35.860
DO YOU KNOW WHERE THE HULA-HOOP
FOR THE STREAMERS ARE?

04:35.900 --> 04:38.520
[KATHARINE] THIS IS MY SON
RYAN.

04:38.570 --> 04:39.860
[JAKE] REALLY?

04:39.900 --> 04:40.860
HEY THERE RYAN.
[RYAN] HI.

04:40.900 --> 04:42.150
[JAKE] JAKE DOYLE,
HOW YOU DOING?

04:42.200 --> 04:43.280
[RYAN] GOOD.

04:43.320 --> 04:44.530
[MALACHY] HI.

04:44.570 --> 04:45.870
[KATHARINE] SO UNLESS THERE IS
ANYTHING ELSE,

04:45.910 --> 04:47.910
I THINK WE'RE DONE
HERE GENTLEMAN.

04:54.460 --> 05:00.460
[JAKE] NO REASON? THINK THAT KID
LOOKED ANYTHING LIKE MR. CHAFE?

05:00.510 --> 05:02.510
JUST GIVE ME A SECOND ALRIGHT?

05:03.720 --> 05:06.720
&lt;♪♪&gt;

05:18.560 --> 05:21.320
[MARTIN] ANGEL, BABY, DARLING.
YOU DIDN'T SEE ME?

05:24.570 --> 05:26.570
[ROSE] GET OUT OF MY--
[MARTIN] YOU'RE RUNNING A PRETTY
TIGHT SHIP HERE.

05:26.610 --> 05:27.530
I MUST COMMEND YOU.

05:27.570 --> 05:28.910
[ROSE] GET OUT OF MY HOUSE
MARTIN!

05:28.950 --> 05:30.910
[MARTIN] I MEAN LOOK AT THIS?
YOUR HOUSE?
[ROSE] YEAH.

05:30.950 --> 05:33.120
[MARTIN] THIS IS MALACHY'S
HOUSE AS I UNDERSTAND THINGS.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.790
[ROSE] OKAY YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'RE STARTING TO PISS ME OFF.

05:34.830 --> 05:36.540
[MARTIN] LOOK AT THIS,
EVERYTHINGS IN ORDER.

05:36.580 --> 05:39.380
I LIKE THAT. I WOULD NOT COME
AROUND IF IT WASN'T FOR THE FACT

05:39.420 --> 05:41.710
THAT YOU ACTUALLY LOOK SO GOOD.

05:41.750 --> 05:45.090
[JAKE] IT ALL HAS
SOMETHING TO DO WITH THAT SAFE.

05:45.130 --> 05:46.510
WHAT DO YOU THINK SKIPPER?

05:46.550 --> 05:48.390
THE DEAD GUY,
HE RAN TWO FAMILIES?

05:48.430 --> 05:50.720
[MALACHY] I DON'T KNOW.
KATHERINE WALSH IS MARRIED.

05:50.760 --> 05:54.560
[DES] YOU KNOW MY BUDDY DARREN,
HE ALWAYS THOUGHT THAT
HIS SISTER WAS HIS SISTER

05:54.600 --> 05:57.560
AND THAT HIS GRANDMOTHER
WAS HIS MOTHER, AND THEN
ONE DAY HE FOUND OUT

05:57.600 --> 06:02.530
THAT HIS SISTER WAS HIS MOTHER.

06:02.570 --> 06:04.490
BURNT.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.530
[JAKE] WHAT EXACTLY IS
THE POINT OF THAT LITTLE
PARABLE THERE DESMOND?

06:07.570 --> 06:08.950
[DES] I'M JUST SAYING,

06:08.990 --> 06:11.700
THAT SOMETIMES BEING MARRIED
DOESN'T MATTER.

06:11.740 --> 06:12.990
STUFF HAPPENS MAN.

06:13.040 --> 06:15.080
[JAKE] REALLY?

06:15.120 --> 06:18.500
WHY IS IT SOMETIMES WHENEVER
YOU TALK I ALWAYS GET THIS URGE
TO PUNCH YOU IN THE EYE?

06:18.540 --> 06:20.540
[DES] CAUSE YOU'RE MEAN.

06:20.580 --> 06:24.210
[MALACHY] IT'S QUITE POSSIBLE
THIS COULD HAVE SIMPLY BEEN
AN HONEST DONATION.

06:24.260 --> 06:25.460
[JAKE] I DON'T KNOW.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.760
ARTHUR CHAFE NEVER MADE
A DONATION IN HIS LIFE.

06:27.800 --> 06:31.760
HE AND HIS BROTHER FRANCIS,
THEY OWN "WILLIAM L CHAFE AND
SONS" THE CLOTHING STORE.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.430
BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH IT. HE'S
NOT EXACTLY A PHILANTHROPIST.

06:36.810 --> 06:39.060
[MALACHY] MIGHT BE WORTH
HAVING A CHAT WITH THE BROTHER,

06:39.100 --> 06:41.860
SEE HOW BUSINESS WAS
REALLY DOING?

06:41.900 --> 06:44.900
[JAKE] IS SHE DOING RENNOS
IN THERE, OR WHAT?

06:48.240 --> 06:49.360
[MALACHY] ROSE,
WHAT'S ALL THAT NOISE?

06:49.410 --> 06:50.740
[ROSE] UM YEAH-- NOTHING!

06:50.780 --> 06:52.660
I'M JUST UH-- I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

06:52.700 --> 06:54.490
[MALACHY] OH, YOU OKAY?
[ROSE] GOOD.

06:54.540 --> 06:55.160
MAKING SOME TEA.

06:55.200 --> 06:56.080
[MALACHY] RIGHT.

06:56.120 --> 06:58.120
[MARTIN] HOW CAN YOU NOT
HAVE A KETTLE?

06:59.710 --> 07:01.290
[ROSE] MARTIN?!

07:01.330 --> 07:04.300
[JAKE] HEY THERE MINI POPS.
[DES] HEY.

07:04.340 --> 07:06.130
[TINNY] WHERE YOU AT?
[MALACHY] HEY.

07:06.170 --> 07:07.800
[TINNY] HI.
[JAKE] MY GUTS TELLING ME

07:07.840 --> 07:11.470
KATHERINE WALSH HAD A BETTER
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE DECEASED
THAN SHE'S LETTING ON.

07:11.510 --> 07:13.640
[ROSE] WOULD YOU JUST
STOP IT!

07:13.680 --> 07:15.640
[MARTIN] WHAT? AND WHAT?

07:15.680 --> 07:18.020
NOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN
IF MR. MALACHY WERE TO COME IN
RIGHT NOW

07:18.060 --> 07:21.480
AND SEE YOUR HANDS ALL OVER ME?
[ROSE] MALACHY DOYLE COULD
CARE LESS ABOUT YOU.

07:21.520 --> 07:23.940
[MARTIN] NOW WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE, DON'T WE?

07:23.980 --> 07:24.770
OW!

07:24.820 --> 07:25.610
WHAT?

07:25.650 --> 07:26.650
[ROSE] I'VE HAD IT WITH YOU.

07:26.690 --> 07:28.820
[MALACHY] IF ARTHUR DID
HAVE TWO FAMILIES,

07:28.860 --> 07:32.620
A CHARITY MIGHT BE AN
INTERESTING WAY OF HIDING
SOME SORT OF ALIMONY PAYMENT.

07:32.660 --> 07:34.620
MIGHT BE WORTH GETTING
A LOOK AT HER FINANCES.

07:34.660 --> 07:36.620
[JAKE] I WISH THAT I HAD A WAY
TO GET DEEPER INSIDE THAT

07:36.660 --> 07:39.250
YOUTH CENTRE YOU KNOW?
DO SOME REAL DIGGING.

07:39.290 --> 07:41.540
[MALACHY] YOU DON'T EXACTLY
PASS FOR 16 ANYMORE JAKE.

07:41.580 --> 07:44.630
[TINNY] I'LL GO.
[JAKE] OH YEAH?

07:44.670 --> 07:45.790
[TINNY] YEAH.

07:45.840 --> 07:47.760
YOU MOPES HAVE ALREADY BLOWN
YOUR COVER.

07:47.800 --> 07:50.840
PLUS I'M THE RIGHT AGE AND
IT'S NOT DANGEROUS.

07:50.880 --> 07:54.220
[JAKE] YOU'RE A CHIP OFF THE
OLD DOYLE BLOCK, AREN'T YOU?

07:54.260 --> 07:57.470
[ROSE] THESE ARE DIVORCE
PAPERS, OKAY?

07:57.520 --> 08:01.480
I WANT YOU TO SIGN THEM AND THEN
GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!

08:01.520 --> 08:02.600
[MARTIN] YOU GET NO RESISTANCE
FROM ME.

08:02.650 --> 08:03.600
I'M HAPPY TO SIGN THESE.

08:03.650 --> 08:05.980
[ROSE] GOOD!
GOOD! I'LL GET YOU A PEN.

08:06.020 --> 08:10.650
[MARTIN] YEAH, NO PROBLEM.
"THE SUPREME COURT OF
NEWFOUNDLAND AND LABRADOR"...

08:10.700 --> 08:13.280
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA GET MY LAWYER TO
TAKE A QUICK LOOK AT THIS.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.030
[ROSE] YOUR LAWYER? OH C'MON!

08:15.070 --> 08:17.950
[MARTIN] IT MAY NOT BE HIS
AREA, BUT I RESPECT HIS OPINION.

08:17.990 --> 08:19.750
CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME TILL
8 O'CLOCK TONIGHT?

08:19.790 --> 08:21.660
TELL YOU WHAT, THERE IS
A GOOD IDEA.

08:21.710 --> 08:24.380
8 O'CLOCK TONIGHT YOU COME
TO MY ROOM--
[ROSE] NO I WON'T--

08:24.420 --> 08:27.590
[MARTIN] YES, AND THEN WE HAVE
A LITTLE SIGNING PARTY.

08:27.630 --> 08:29.210
DOESN'T THAT SOUND GOOD?
[ROSE] NO IT DOES NOT.

08:29.260 --> 08:30.550
IT DOESN'T SOUND GOOD AT ALL.
I'M NOT COMING.

08:30.590 --> 08:33.510
YOU'RE GONNA SIGN THOSE PAPERS
AND YOU SEND THEM BACK TO ME.

08:33.550 --> 08:35.340
[MARTIN] OH NO.
THERE'S NO SENDING HERE.

08:35.390 --> 08:40.770
EITHER YOU COME TO MY ROOM AND
I'LL SIGN THESE OR YOU CAN
FORGET THE WHOLE DAMN THING.

08:43.810 --> 08:45.940
YEAH, YOUR DECISION.

08:45.980 --> 08:47.690
IT'S YOUR CALL.

08:47.730 --> 08:51.110
MY ROOM, 8 O'CLOCK.
YOU KNOW WHERE TO FIND ME.

08:55.240 --> 08:57.160
[TINNY] I'LL JUST GO IN,
HAVE A LOOK AROUND SEE IF I CAN

08:57.200 --> 09:01.160
MAKE THE CONNECTION
BETWEEN KATHERINE WALSH
AND THE DEAD GUY.

09:01.200 --> 09:03.580
WHAT DO YOU THINK DES?
YOU FEEL LIKE GETTING INVOLVED
IN THE COMMUNITY?

09:03.620 --> 09:06.330
[DES] I ALREADY DID MY
COMMUNITY SERVICE YEARS AGO.

09:06.380 --> 09:09.380
[TINNY] EXCELLENT.
WE'RE ALL AGREED THEN.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.380
[JAKE] YOU KNOW WHAT,
THINK I'M GONNA GET MYSELF
A NEW SUIT DOWN THERE.

09:13.420 --> 09:16.760
[MALACHY] YOU KNOW I GOT
MARRIED IN A "CHAFE AND SONS"
SUIT. SEE YOU LATER.

09:16.800 --> 09:17.850
[JAKE] IS THAT RIGHT?

09:17.890 --> 09:19.890
WERE YOU TOO FAT TO FIT
IN YOUR COP UNIFORM?

09:19.930 --> 09:21.770
[MALACHY] NO. YOUR MOTHER
WOULDN'T LET ME WEAR IT.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.690
[ROSE] MALACHY, I GOT THE
DIVORCE PAPERS FROM WALTER

09:24.730 --> 09:27.310
AND MARTIN SAID HE'D SIGN THEM.

09:28.810 --> 09:29.730
[MALACHY] YOU SAW MARTIN?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.360
[ROSE] YEAH,
AT THE GROCERY STORE

09:32.400 --> 09:35.200
AND HE SAID HE WOULD
SIGN THE PAPERS

09:35.240 --> 09:38.240
NO PROBLEM,
TONIGHT AT HIS HOTEL.

09:46.920 --> 09:48.750
IT'S GONNA BE OVER SOON MALACHY.

09:48.790 --> 09:50.590
[MALACHY] HIS HOTEL ROOM?

09:52.880 --> 09:54.090
ALONE?!

09:55.220 --> 09:57.220
[ROSE] I WANT THIS DONE
TONIGHT.

10:00.640 --> 10:03.220
&lt;♪♪&gt;

10:07.230 --> 10:09.110
[JAKE] SO FRANCIS,
HOW'S BUSINESS?

10:09.150 --> 10:11.190
[FRANCIS] OH NEVER BETTER.
CLIENTELE ON A STEADY GROW.

10:11.230 --> 10:14.490
AS YOU KNOW, WE GET PEOPLE
FLYING IN FROM THE MAINLAND TO
GET ONE OF MY SUITS MADE.

10:14.530 --> 10:16.110
[JAKE] YEAH THAT'S WHAT THEY
TELL ME, THEY ALSO TELL ME

10:16.150 --> 10:17.660
THAT YOU'RE THE BEST.
[FRANCIS] THAT MIGHT BE TRUE.

10:17.700 --> 10:19.780
MY BROTHER AND I WERE
A QUITE A TEAM.

10:19.820 --> 10:21.280
[MALACHY] YOU AND ARTHUR WERE
BOTH TAILORS?

10:21.330 --> 10:22.790
[FRANCIS] OH GOOD GOD NO.
I CUT THE SUITS.

10:22.830 --> 10:25.830
MY BROTHER COULDN'T HEM
A PANT LEG IF HIS LIFE.

10:25.870 --> 10:29.920
HE JUST KEPT THE BOOKS
AND I CUT THE SUITS.

10:29.960 --> 10:32.130
I NEVER THOUGHT MY BROTHER
WOULD TAKE HIS OWN LIFE.

10:32.170 --> 10:34.800
I DON'T KNOW HOW I'M GONNA GET
ON WITHOUT HIM.

10:34.840 --> 10:39.680
[JAKE] MR. CHAFE, IS THERE ANY
CHANCE THAT MAYBE ARTHUR WAS
HAVING AN AFFAIR ON HIS WIFE?

10:39.720 --> 10:40.850
[FRANCIS] BE RIGHT BACK TOM.

10:40.890 --> 10:42.140
ARTHUR? NO, NO.

10:42.180 --> 10:44.010
YOU'RE BARKING UP THE WRONG
TREE THERE MY SON.

10:44.060 --> 10:47.020
MY BROTHER LOVED HIS WIFE.
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,

10:47.060 --> 10:51.440
HE WAS FRIGHTENED TO DEATH
OF HER. NO CHANCE HE WAS
STEPPING OUT ON THAT.

10:51.480 --> 10:54.610
[JAKE] ARE YOU SURE?
I MEAN JANET SEEMED PRETTY
CONVINCED AT THE WAKE.

10:54.650 --> 10:57.900
[FRANCIS] OH YES, SHE'S
YOU KNOW, EMOTIONAL.

10:57.950 --> 11:00.410
IF ARTHUR WAS HAVING AN
AFFAIR, I MEAN, I'D KNOW.

11:00.450 --> 11:02.160
YOU'RE 40 REG? RIGHT?

11:02.200 --> 11:04.120
[MALACHY] BY THE WAY MR. CHAFE,
WHERE DO YOU KEEP YOUR SAFE?

11:04.160 --> 11:07.040
[FRANCIS] OH, DON'T HAVE ONE.
MOST PEOPLE USE DEBIT
OR CARD THESE DAYS.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.250
WHATEVER CASH WE HAVE
I USUALLY TAKE STRAIGHT TO
THE BANK ON CLOSING.

11:09.290 --> 11:11.250
WOULD YOU EXCUSE ME?

11:11.290 --> 11:13.290
[JAKE] THANKS FOR YOUR TIME.

11:13.340 --> 11:15.420
SO HE DOESN'T GOT A SAFE,
JANET DON'T GOT A SAFE,

11:15.460 --> 11:17.470
NO ONE GOT A FRIGGIN' SAFE.

11:18.920 --> 11:21.680
&lt;♪♪&gt;

11:26.100 --> 11:27.220
[LESLIE] 10 MORE!

11:27.270 --> 11:29.770
[JAKE] THAT'S IT!
CRACK THAT WHIP CONSTABLE!

11:29.810 --> 11:31.810
[LESLIE] YOU'D LIKE THAT,
WOULDN'T YOU?

11:34.270 --> 11:38.990
ARTHUR CHAFE PUT A HOSE
FROM THE TAIL PIPE TO
THE WINDOW OF HIS CAR.

11:39.030 --> 11:40.400
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING INTO?

11:40.450 --> 11:44.870
[JAKE] OH AH, JUST SOMETHING
FUNNY IN HIS WILL.

11:44.910 --> 11:46.200
[LESLIE] FUNNY HOW?

11:46.240 --> 11:50.290
HEY HOLLYWOOD!
JUST CAUSE I'M SITTING DOWN
DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN!

11:50.330 --> 11:51.830
[JAKE] POSSIBLY ANOTHER WOMAN,
IT MIGHT BE NOTHING.

11:51.870 --> 11:54.290
I JUST WANTED TO GIVE
YOU THE HEADS UP YOU KNOW,
BECAUSE YOU AND PIKE.

11:54.340 --> 11:55.710
YOU SIGNED OFF ON HIS THING.

11:55.750 --> 11:58.510
[LESLIE] IT'S A STRAIGHT
SUICIDE. NO SIGN OF FOUL PLAY.

11:58.550 --> 12:01.090
[JAKE] YEAH, I KNOW. BUT WHY
DID THE GUY GO ALL THE WAY UP

12:01.130 --> 12:02.930
IN THE MIDDLE OF NOWHERE
TO KILL HIMSELF, YOU KNOW.

12:02.970 --> 12:05.050
WHEN HE'S GOT A PERFECTLY GOOD
TWO-CAR GARAGE AT HOME?

12:05.100 --> 12:08.930
[LESLIE] PEOPLE TEND TO
KILL THEMSELVES IN PLACES
THAT MEAN SOMETHING TO THEM.

12:08.970 --> 12:10.890
IF HE WAS HAVING AN AFFAIR,
COULD BE WHERE IT STARTED,

12:10.940 --> 12:12.980
WHERE IT ENDED,
COULD BE ANYTHING.

12:13.020 --> 12:15.520
[JAKE] DOES THAT MEAN
I GOTTA KILL MYSELF
IN YOUR KITCHEN THEN?

12:15.560 --> 12:17.780
[LESLIE] DON'T BE TALKING
ABOUT OFFING YOURSELF DOYLE.

12:17.820 --> 12:20.320
GET A GIRL ALL EXCITED.
[JAKE] THANKS.

12:20.360 --> 12:21.740
[JAKE] THANKS.

12:23.860 --> 12:25.490
[LESLIE] 3 MORE!

12:26.160 --> 12:28.120
[JAKE] SO WHAT ARE YOU GONNA
LEAVE ME IN YOUR WILL ANYWAY?

12:28.160 --> 12:31.120
[MALACHY] I DON'T KNOW,
MY NEIL DIAMOND RECORDS
AND A TOOTHBRUSH.

12:31.160 --> 12:33.120
[JAKE] LIKE YOU
GOT A TOOTHBRUSH.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.790
[MALACHY] I'M NOT IN THE MOOD!

12:37.420 --> 12:39.260
[JAKE] ALRIGHT SO LET'S SEE,
WHAT DO WE GOT?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.300
ME, CHRISTIAN, AND KATHLEEN.

12:42.340 --> 12:43.970
IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DIVIDE
FIFTY BUCKS BETWEEN

12:44.010 --> 12:45.050
"TREE" PEOPLE.

12:45.090 --> 12:45.930
[MALACHY] HOW MANY TIMES
I GOTTA TELL YOU

12:45.970 --> 12:47.720
"TREES" ARE IN THE GARDEN?

12:47.760 --> 12:49.470
ONE, TWO, "THREE".

12:49.520 --> 12:51.520
[JAKE] WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM
TODAY?

12:54.650 --> 12:58.520
[JAKE] HEY THERE!

12:58.570 --> 13:00.070
WHAT YOU'RE PLAYING HOP SCOTCH?

13:00.110 --> 13:00.900
[LITTLE GIRL] YEAH.

13:00.940 --> 13:03.900
YOU STUPID?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.820
[JAKE] WHAT ARE YOU DOING ALL
THE WAY OUT HERE ANYWAY?

13:05.860 --> 13:09.790
[LITTLE GIRL] MOM SAYS WE'RE
ALLOWED, WHAT'S IT TO YOU?

13:09.830 --> 13:13.000
[JAKE] IS THAT CHALK?
[LITTLE GIRL] BUDDY THREW IT
AWAY, I DIDN'T STEAL IT.

13:13.040 --> 13:16.170
[JAKE] OKAY I DIDN'T SAY THAT
YOU STOLE IT. CAN I SEE IT?

13:16.210 --> 13:17.790
[LITTLE GIRL] NO.

13:21.170 --> 13:23.920
[JAKE] HOW ABOUT I GIVE YOU
5 BUCKS FOR IT?

13:23.970 --> 13:25.340
HOLD ON.

13:25.380 --> 13:27.220
WHERE DID YOU SAY YOU GOT
THIS AGAIN?

13:27.260 --> 13:29.180
[LITTLE GIRL] A MAN THREW IT
AT ANOTHER MANS HEAD.

13:29.220 --> 13:31.020
THEY STARTED PUSHING
AND YELLING.

13:31.060 --> 13:32.180
[JAKE] TWO MEN WERE
FIGHTING HERE?

13:32.220 --> 13:35.810
[LITTLE GIRL] NO, OVER THERE.

13:35.850 --> 13:37.020
[JAKE] THEN WHAT HAPPENED?

13:37.060 --> 13:39.190
[LITTLE GIRL] THEN I WENT IN
FOR SUPPER.

13:39.230 --> 13:43.110
[JAKE] DID YOU NOW?
HERE IS YOUR 5 BUCKS.

13:43.150 --> 13:44.780
[LITTLE GIRL] WELCOME.

13:46.070 --> 13:48.030
[JAKE] HEY!
[MALACHY] WHAT?

13:48.070 --> 13:49.450
[JAKE] TAILORS CHALK.

13:51.120 --> 13:52.870
[MALACHY] NOT TOO MANY TAILORS
AROUND HERE.

13:52.910 --> 13:55.290
[JAKE] NO, BUT I THINK I KNOW
A GOOD ONE.

14:01.000 --> 14:02.840
[JAKE] THAT WAS SOME SHOW
YOU PUT ON.

14:02.880 --> 14:04.840
YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOUR
BROTHER TOOK HIS OWN LIFE?

14:04.880 --> 14:06.090
[FRANCIS] I DON'T KNOW WHAT
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

14:06.130 --> 14:08.220
[MALACHY] FRANCIS, A WITNESS
IS SAYING THAT YOU WERE IN

14:08.260 --> 14:10.850
A PHYSICAL ALTERCATION
WITH YOUR BROTHER AT THE
SCENE OF THE SUICIDE.

14:10.890 --> 14:13.640
[FRANCIS] YEAH-- YES
WE HAD A LITTLE ARGUMENT.

14:13.680 --> 14:16.060
BUT WHEN I LEFT HE WAS ALIVE.

14:16.100 --> 14:19.060
I MEAN WE FOUGHT, YES,
WE'RE BROTHERS.

14:19.100 --> 14:21.860
[MALACHY] SO, WHAT WERE YOU
FIGHTING ABOUT?

14:25.110 --> 14:27.990
[FRANCIS] HEY! EXCUSE ME?!
EXCUSE ME?! EXCUSE ME?!

14:28.030 --> 14:29.370
EXCUSE ME!

14:29.410 --> 14:31.410
PLEASE DON'T TOUCH THAT!

14:34.160 --> 14:36.910
[JAKE] WHAT A GREAT SPOT TO
HIDE A SAFE, HEY?

14:40.710 --> 14:42.800
[FRANCIS] MY BROTHER WAS A
PIECE OF SHIT.

14:42.840 --> 14:44.550
YOU HAPPY NOW?

14:44.590 --> 14:45.420
[JAKE] WHAT HAPPENED?

14:45.460 --> 14:46.970
[FRANCIS] WELL I DIDN'T
KILL HIM.

14:47.010 --> 14:49.840
THE BASTARD WAS SKIMMING FROM
ME, 2 GRAND A MONTH.

14:49.890 --> 14:51.680
GOD KNOWS HOW LONG,
AND HIDING IT RIGHT THERE

14:51.720 --> 14:53.010
IN THAT SAFE.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.260
[MALACHY] HOW DO YOU KNOW HE
WAS SKIMMING?

14:54.310 --> 14:55.680
[FRANCIS] WELL HE THOUGHT
I WAS AN IDIOT,

14:55.720 --> 14:57.100
WOULDN'T LET ME NEAR THE BOOKS.

14:57.140 --> 14:58.600
[JAKE] SO?

14:58.640 --> 14:59.900
[FRANCIS] SO I CHECKED THE
BOOKS AGAINST THE CASH REGISTER

14:59.940 --> 15:01.900
AND THE NUMBERS
DIDN'T ADD UP, OBVIOUSLY!

15:01.940 --> 15:03.900
[JAKE] WHERE IS THE SAFE NOW?

15:03.940 --> 15:06.070
[FRANCIS] I DON'T KNOW.
[JAKE] OKAY, WHAT DID IT DRAG

15:06.110 --> 15:07.610
ITSELF OUT THE DOOR? OR WHAT?

15:07.650 --> 15:09.030
[FRANCIS] FINE. ALRIGHT.

15:09.070 --> 15:10.240
I PAID A MAN TO STEAL IT.

15:10.280 --> 15:12.830
I SEE HIM EVERY NOW AND AGAIN
WHEN HE'S NOT IN PRISON.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.330
I DIDN'T WANT ARTHUR TO KNOW...

15:15.370 --> 15:16.290
I KNEW.

15:16.330 --> 15:17.450
IT WAS MY MONEY.

15:17.500 --> 15:18.620
[MALACHY] WHERE IS THIS MAN
NOW?

15:18.660 --> 15:19.790
[FRANCIS] NO, NO, NO.

15:19.830 --> 15:20.500
I'M NOT TELLING YOU.

15:20.540 --> 15:21.830
YOU'LL TAKE MY MONEY.

15:21.870 --> 15:24.130
[JAKE] FRANCIS, WE DON'T WANT
YOUR MONEY, OKAY?

15:24.170 --> 15:26.760
[MALACHY] WE FIND YOUR SAFE,
YOU GET WHAT'S COMING TO YOU.

15:26.800 --> 15:28.170
TRUST US.

15:29.170 --> 15:30.510
[FRANCIS] WELL I DON'T
HAVE ANADDRESS

15:30.550 --> 15:32.800
CAUSE HE TOOK OFF WITH THE SAFE
AND I HAVEN'T HEARD FROM HIM.

15:32.850 --> 15:33.680
I MEAN THAT WAS STUPID.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.350
[JAKE] YES, YOU WERE STUPID!

15:35.390 --> 15:36.060
ALRIGHT?

15:36.100 --> 15:38.100
WHAT IS HIS NAME?

15:39.980 --> 15:41.690
FRANCIS?!

15:41.730 --> 15:43.940
[FRANCIS] FELLAS,
THIS GUY DOESN'T BUY A SUIT
TO GO WORK 9 TO 5

15:43.980 --> 15:46.530
YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
[JAKE] NO, I HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

15:46.570 --> 15:48.150
WILL YOU TELL US HIS NAME?

15:48.190 --> 15:50.950
[FRANCIS] I'VE ONLY GOT
A FIRST NAME, WILBUR.

15:54.580 --> 15:56.490
[DES] OKAY I'M WONDERING IF WE
SHOULD HAVE CODE NAMES HERE?

15:56.540 --> 15:59.540
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA BE?
[TINNY] TINNY!

16:05.460 --> 16:07.590
HORATIO?

16:07.630 --> 16:09.550
NO, THAT'S REALLY COOL DES.

16:09.590 --> 16:13.590
[DES] WHAT? I'M UNDERCOVER.
[TINNY] YEAH, WHY NOT
"DOUCHEY BRASCO"?

16:15.300 --> 16:17.310
[DES] FINE, I'LL JUST BE DES.

16:23.270 --> 16:26.150
[TINNY] THAT RYAN KID,
HOW OLD DO YOU THINK HE IS?

16:26.190 --> 16:27.360
[DES] HIM? WHO CARES.

16:27.400 --> 16:30.530
HE'S WAY TOO-- HE'S NOT--
RIGHT FOR YOU AT ALL.

16:30.570 --> 16:32.490
WHY WOULD YOU--
HE'S A LOSER.

16:32.530 --> 16:34.990
[TINNY] DES, THE DEAD GUY.

16:35.030 --> 16:36.910
HE MIGHT BE THE REAL FATHER.

16:36.950 --> 16:39.700
MAYBE HE WAS GIVING THE MONEY
TO SUPPORT HIS ILLEGITIMATE SON.

16:39.750 --> 16:42.540
[DES] OH YEAH, BASTARD CHILD.

16:42.580 --> 16:45.630
I WAS ONE OF THEM.

16:45.670 --> 16:47.420
I AM...

16:47.460 --> 16:48.290
NO I WAS.

16:48.340 --> 16:50.550
SEE I'M NOT A BASTARD ANYMORE.

16:50.590 --> 16:52.220
[TINNY] SHUT UP.

17:03.850 --> 17:05.230
[JANET] SKIMMING?

17:05.270 --> 17:07.190
WHY WOULD HE STEAL
FROM HIMSELF?

17:07.230 --> 17:09.570
[MALACHY] TECHNICALLY HE WAS
STEALING FROM HIS BROTHER.

17:09.610 --> 17:11.280
[JANET] OH GOD!

17:11.320 --> 17:15.450
WHO WAS I MARRIED TO?

17:15.490 --> 17:19.160
[JAKE] DO YOU KNOW THIS WOMAN?

17:19.200 --> 17:21.370
[JANET] THIS IS HER?
[JAKE] YES MAM.

17:21.410 --> 17:22.580
DO YOU RECOGNIZE HER?

17:22.620 --> 17:25.500
[JANET] SHE EVEN LOOKS LIKE
A MONEY-STEALING WHORE.

17:25.540 --> 17:27.130
[MALACHY] HOW WAS YOUR
MARRIAGE MRS. CHAFE?

17:27.170 --> 17:30.250
[JANET] EXCUSE ME?
[MALACHY] YOUR MARRIAGE?

17:30.300 --> 17:31.710
WAS IT A HAPPY MARRIAGE?

17:31.760 --> 17:33.420
[JANET] YES!

17:33.470 --> 17:37.220
[MALACHY] ARTHUR'S BROTHER
SAID THEIR RELATIONSHIP WAS
GOLDEN TOO.

17:37.260 --> 17:39.680
UNTIL WE DISCOVERED JUST
HOW MUCH HE REALLY HATED HIM.

17:39.720 --> 17:41.520
JUST TRYING TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE GETTING THE TRUTH HERE.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.980
[JANET] I'M TELLING THE TRUTH.

17:43.020 --> 17:45.810
I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEING LIED
TO HERE, AND I HIRED YOU--

17:45.850 --> 17:48.360
[MALACHY] A MAN DOESN'T
JUST KILL HIMSELF WHEN
HIS LIFE IS PERFECT!

17:48.400 --> 17:50.860
[JANET] WELL WHY DON'T
YOU ASK THAT SLUT WHAT
WAS WRONG WITH HIM?

17:50.900 --> 17:54.400
CAUSE AS FAR AS I'M
CONCERNED HE WAS FINE!

17:54.440 --> 17:56.860
[MALACHY] SORRY MRS. CHAFE.

17:56.910 --> 17:58.280
PARDON ME.

18:02.330 --> 18:04.290
[JAKE] I THINK WHAT MY FATHER
IS TRYING TO SAY--

18:04.330 --> 18:05.290
&lt;THE DOOR SLAMS&gt;

18:06.920 --> 18:10.790
IS THAT WE STILL HAVE A
FEW UNANSWERED QUESTIONS
ABOUT YOUR HUSBAND.

18:10.840 --> 18:12.840
[JANET] YEAH, JOIN THE CLUB.

18:15.130 --> 18:18.140
&lt;♪♪&gt;

18:23.220 --> 18:24.730
[NIKKI] DAMMIT!
[JAKE] WHAT?! WHAT?!

18:24.770 --> 18:26.190
[NIKKI] JAKE! "WHAT?"!
[JAKE] WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?!

18:26.230 --> 18:29.860
[NIKKI] WHAT IS WRONG WITH ME?!
I BROKE UP WITH JIM!
THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG!

18:29.900 --> 18:31.190
[JAKE] OKAY, SORRY.

18:31.230 --> 18:32.690
[NIKKI] YEAH, I BET YOU'RE
SORRY. I BET.

18:32.730 --> 18:35.280
[JAKE] OKAY NIKKI LOOK,
HE'S A FOOL TO LEAVE YOU.

18:35.320 --> 18:36.280
[NIKKI] YES!

18:36.320 --> 18:37.150
NO. NO, NO.

18:37.200 --> 18:39.280
I DUMPED HIM.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.330
[JAKE] WHY?
[NIKKI] I DON'T KNOW WHY!

18:41.370 --> 18:43.490
I DON'T KNOW WHY
BECAUSE EVERYTHING ABOUT HIM
WAS PERFECT!

[MARTIN] YOU'RE FUNNY.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE ROOM?

24:58.910 --> 25:00.700

WAY YOU LIKE IT, WITH THE LEMON.

25:33.740 --> 25:37.910
[ROSE] THIS IS-- I DIDN'T
KNOW YOU COULD COOK
ANYTHING OTHER THAN NOODLES.

25:37.950 --> 25:40.450
[MARTIN] I PICKED UP
A COUPLE OF THINGS IN THE JOINT,
FEW POSITIVES THERE.

25:40.490 --> 25:44.330
AS LONG AS YOU GIVE ME A HOT
PLATE, I CAN PRETTY MUCH
ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING NOW.

25:44.370 --> 25:48.710
YOU KNOW I WAS IN THE FISH STORE

FIRST NAME IS WILBUR?

26:02.810 --> 26:06.650
[WALTER] OH YEAH, I KNOW THAT

STILL WEAR THAT TODAY.

26:42.640 --> 26:45.230
[ROSE] NOT AFTER THIS MEAL,

28:51.560 --> 28:55.310
20 YEARS OF TROUBLE. BEST WAY TO
AVOID SUCH A THING WOULD BE TO,

32:58.510 --> 32:59.600
SHE'S OUR CLIENT.

32:59.640 --> 33:00.980
SHE'S JUST LOST HER HUSBAND.

33:01.020 --> 33:02.560
[KATHARINE] THIS IS THE WOMAN
WHO HIRED YOU?

33:02.600 --> 33:04.150
I'VE NEVER EVEN MET
YOUR HUSBAND!

33:04.190 --> 33:05.350
[JAKE] OKAY LOOK AT ME ALRIGHT?

33:05.400 --> 33:06.560

33:08.070 --> 33:09.820
OFFICER, CAN YOU TAKE HER HOME

33:09.860 --> 33:15.110

33:15.160 --> 33:16.530
[KATHARINE] OKAY, LOOK, LOOK.

33:16.570 --> 33:18.660
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED.
I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS.

33:18.700 --> 33:21.080
I'VE NEVER EVEN SEEN
THE WOMAN BEFORE.

33:26.420 --> 33:29.420
&lt;♪♪&gt;

33:38.430 --> 33:40.430
[JAKE] I GOT NO IDEA
WHAT I'M DOING.

33:40.850 --> 33:43.850
[MALACHY] JUST USE THE CHISEL
WILL YA?

33:44.140 --> 33:47.650
WOW! TINNY PULLED IT OFF.

33:47.690 --> 33:50.190
SHE MANAGED TO DOWNLOAD
KATHERINE'S BANK RECORDS.

33:50.230 --> 33:52.900
[JAKE] SHE'S GOT THE TOUCH,
THAT ONE.

33:52.940 --> 33:55.320
[MALACHY] KATHERINE DONATES
MONEY TO HER OWN YOUTH CENTRE
EACH MONTH.

33:55.360 --> 33:58.070
SAME AMOUNT EVERY TIME,
2000 BUCKS.

33:58.120 --> 33:59.080
[JAKE] OW!

34:20.180 --> 34:21.350
[MALACHY] NO, NO, NO.
HOLD ON.

34:21.390 --> 34:23.060
THIS IS YOUR BROTHER'S SAFE.
IT BELONGS TO HIS WIFE.

34:23.100 --> 34:25.140
[FRANCIS] ACTUALLY IT WAS
PURCHASED BY "CHAFE AND SONS".

34:25.180 --> 34:26.810
SO THIS IS MY SAFE.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

34:26.850 --> 34:27.560
STEP AWAY.

34:27.600 --> 34:28.900

34:28.940 --> 34:29.770
[FRANCIS] JUST HOLD OFF!

34:29.810 --> 34:31.020
JUST BACK OFF! BACK OFF!

34:31.070 --> 34:32.110
OR I'LL CALL THE COPS
RIGHT NOW.

34:32.150 --> 34:33.070
THIS IS STOLEN PROPERTY.

34:33.110 --> 34:34.990
[MALACHY] OKAY, OKAY.

34:35.030 --> 34:37.030
[JAKE] FILL YOUR BOOTS, BUDDY.

34:41.410 --> 34:43.410
[FRANCIS] YES, THANK YOU.

34:46.620 --> 34:49.250
[MALACHY] YOU MIGHT
WANT TO USE A DOLLY.

34:50.330 --> 34:52.000
[FRANCIS] THANK YOU GENTLEMEN.

34:52.040 --> 34:56.260
REMEMBER MY DOOR IS ALWAYS
OPEN AND WE'LL SOON HAVE
OUR FALL ARRIVALS.

34:56.300 --> 34:59.390
&lt;JAKE CELL PHONE RINGS&gt;

34:59.430 --> 35:01.260
[JAKE] HEY, WHAT DO YOU WANT?

35:01.300 --> 35:03.310
[TINNY] I THINK I SOLVED YOUR
CASE FOR YOU.

35:03.350 --> 35:05.100
[JAKE] OH, DID YOU NOW?

35:12.320 --> 35:14.280
[ROSE] YOUR FLUNKY DIDN'T
GET THE JOB DONE.

35:14.320 --> 35:16.110
[MALACHY] I KNOW, I KNOW. LOOK
HE WASN'T GONNA PLANT EVIDENCE,

35:16.150 --> 35:17.700
HE WAS JUST TRYING TO
SCARE HIM A LITTLE.

35:17.740 --> 35:18.700
[ROSE] SCARE HIM?!
REALLY SMART MALACHY!

35:18.740 --> 35:19.910
[MALACHY] WELL I DON'T KNOW!
YEAH!

35:19.950 --> 35:21.280
[ROSE] I'M NOT YOUR CLIENT,
OKAY?!

35:21.320 --> 35:22.620
I CAN TAKE CARE OF MYSELF!

35:22.660 --> 35:24.330
[MALACHY] WELL I DON'T SEE YOU
TAKING CARE!

35:24.370 --> 35:26.660
AN EX-CON COMES STRUTTING INTO
TOWN THREATENING YOU?!

35:26.700 --> 35:28.080
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?!

35:28.120 --> 35:30.330
[ROSE] THE BEST, BRIGHTEST
IDEA YOU CAN UP WITH IS TO

35:30.370 --> 35:33.250
SEND SOME BLOODY EX-COP IN
THERE WITH A BAG OF DRUGS?!

35:33.290 --> 35:35.250
[MALACHY] ALRIGHT, NOT ONE
OF MY BETTER IDEAS BUT--

35:35.300 --> 35:36.800
[ROSE] NO REALLY, YOU THINK?!

35:36.840 --> 35:38.630
[MALACHY] I OVERSTEPPED. BUT IT
WAS BETTER THAN JAKE'S IDEA!

35:38.670 --> 35:39.340
[ROSE] WHAT?!

35:39.380 --> 35:41.300
GOONS FROM THE GOULDS?!

35:41.340 --> 35:42.350
[MALACHY] YEAH?
HOW DID YOU KNOW?

35:42.390 --> 35:45.720
[ROSE] I-- I--
I THOUGHT I COULD HANDLE THIS,

35:45.770 --> 35:48.480
I DID. I THOUGHT I COULD
GET RID OF HIM AND I
DON'T KNOW IF I CAN.

35:48.520 --> 35:51.440
[MALACHY] LETS JUST TAKE A
BREATH. LETS THINK.

35:51.480 --> 35:53.060
[ROSE] OKAY.

35:53.110 --> 35:54.270
HERE IS WHAT I KNOW.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.150
YOU CAN'T PUSH MARTIN, OKAY?

35:56.190 --> 35:57.990
AND YOU SURE
AS HELL CAN'T PULL HIM.

35:58.030 --> 36:02.370
[MALACHY] LOOK YOU KNOW HIM
BEST. BUT I'VE DONE THIS BEFORE.

36:02.410 --> 36:05.790
[ROSE] OKAY, LETS FIGURE IT OUT.
LETS JUST FIGURE IT OUT.

36:13.210 --> 36:15.250
[MALACHY] ANYTHING?
[ROSE] NO.

36:15.290 --> 36:18.760
BUT I DID STAB HIM WITH A FORK.

36:18.800 --> 36:21.050
[MALACHY] EXCELLENT.
[JAKE] WHAT ARE WE DOING OUT

36:21.090 --> 36:22.720
HERE, NIECE?
[TINNY] SO KATHERINE'S KID,

36:22.760 --> 36:26.470
RYAN KENDELL, FACEBOOKED ME.
[DES] OH HE DID, DID HE?

36:26.510 --> 36:27.890
YOU'RE NOT GONNA CONFIRM
THAT ARE YOU?

36:27.930 --> 36:29.850
[JAKE] "KENDELL"?
KATHERINE'S LAST NAME IS
"WALSH".

36:29.890 --> 36:32.400
[TINNY] YEAH, I ASKED HIM
ABOUT IT. HE SAYS HE TOOK HIS
DAD'S LAST NAME.

36:32.440 --> 36:36.360
HIS REAL DAD, WHO WAS
KILLED IN A HIT AND RUN
WHEN HE WAS A YEAR OLD.

36:36.400 --> 36:38.030
[JAKE] KILLED IN A HIT AND RUN?

36:38.070 --> 36:41.860
[TINNY] YEAH.
1994 ROBERT KENDELL KILLED.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.280
[JAKE] HERE?
[TINNY] THEY NEVER CAUGHT THE

36:44.320 --> 36:45.490
DRIVER OF THE VEHICLE THAT
KILLED HIM.

36:45.530 --> 36:47.540
[DES] I'LL BE IN THE CAR.

36:48.040 --> 36:50.410
[JAKE] THEY NEVER
FOUND THE DRIVER...

36:52.670 --> 36:57.420
BECAUSE THE DRIVER WAS
ARTHUR CHAFE.

36:57.460 --> 36:59.420
LOOK AT THAT?

36:59.460 --> 37:04.760
AND I BET YOU THAT 2000 BUCKS
MUST BE USED FOR BLACKMAIL.

37:04.800 --> 37:06.050
NICE WORK TINNY.

37:06.100 --> 37:07.470
[TINNY] THANK YOU.

37:12.850 --> 37:14.230
[JAKE] C'MON.

37:21.690 --> 37:24.200
[JAKE] ARTHUR CHAFE,
WHERE DID YOU FIND HIM?

37:24.240 --> 37:27.030
[KATHARINE] I TOLD YOU,
I'D NEVER HEARD OF HIM BEFORE
THE DONATION.

37:27.070 --> 37:29.330
[JAKE] RIGHT.

37:29.370 --> 37:31.080
BESIDES THE BLACKMAIL,
YOU MEAN?

37:31.120 --> 37:32.540
[KATHARINE] I RUN A CHARITY
MR. DOYLE.

37:32.580 --> 37:34.500
[JAKE] YOU MUST BE DOING
PRETTY GOOD THEN IF YOU CAN

37:34.540 --> 37:35.920
DONATE 2000 BUCKS A MONTH BACK
INTO THE FUND.

37:35.960 --> 37:38.340
[KATHARINE] YEAH, I DO WHAT
I CAN TO SUPPORT THE CENTRE.

37:38.380 --> 37:39.630
[JAKE] OKAY LET'S JUST CUT
THE CRAP.

37:39.670 --> 37:41.090
[KATHARINE] OH YEAH GOOD!
NOW WOULD BE GOOD, PLEASE!

37:41.130 --> 37:43.380
[JAKE] SOMEHOW YOU FOUND OUT
THAT ARTHUR CHAFE HAD KILLED

37:43.420 --> 37:45.720
YOUR FIRST HUSBAND IN THAT HIT
AND RUN. INSTEAD OF GOING TO

37:45.760 --> 37:48.220
THE COPS YOU DECIDED TO
BLACKMAIL HIM FOR IT.

37:48.260 --> 37:50.430
[KATHARINE] YOU THINK ARTHUR
KILLED MY ROBERT?

37:50.470 --> 37:52.350
[JAKE] HE WAS SKIMMING 2000
BUCKS A MONTH FROM HIS OWN

37:52.390 --> 37:54.980
STORE TO PAY FOR YOUR
EXTORTION.

37:55.020 --> 37:56.690
[KATHARINE] 2000... 2000...
NO, NO, NO.

37:56.730 --> 37:59.440
THAT WAS MONEY FROM AN
ANONYMOUS DONATION.

37:59.480 --> 38:00.650
THAT WAS A PHILANTHROPIST.

38:00.690 --> 38:03.360
HE'D HEARD ABOUT MY HUSBAND,
HE WANTED TO HELP.

38:03.400 --> 38:06.070
ONCE I GOT BACK ON MY FEET,
I USED THE MONEY TO GET THE
CENTRE OFF THE GROUND.

38:06.110 --> 38:08.120
I NEVER EVEN MET HIM.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.500
[JAKE] I'M SO SORRY.

38:20.250 --> 38:23.260
ARTHUR CHAFE WAS PAYING YOU
THAT MONEY OUT OF GUILT.

38:32.520 --> 38:34.560
[KATHARINE] OH MY GOD!

38:34.600 --> 38:39.480
ALL THESE YEARS,
HE WAS PAYING ME OFF?

38:39.520 --> 38:41.400
[JAKE] I REALLY THOUGHT YOU
KNEW.

38:41.440 --> 38:43.440
I'M SORRY.

38:54.160 --> 38:56.660
&lt;♪♪&gt;

39:08.630 --> 39:10.010
[JAKE] HEY.

39:10.050 --> 39:11.970
[FRANCIS] I ALREADY TOLD YOU,
I OWN THE SAFE.

39:12.010 --> 39:14.430
[JAKE] JUST UH...

39:14.470 --> 39:16.980
RELAX, ALRIGHT? DO YOU WANT ME
TO OPEN IT OR NOT?

39:17.020 --> 39:18.980
[FRANCIS] YEAH, ALRIGHT.

39:19.020 --> 39:20.730
I'VE BEEN AT IT ALL NIGHT.
I'M NOT MUCH OF A--

39:20.770 --> 39:22.900
NO GO AHEAD,
KNOCK YOURSELF OUT.

39:22.940 --> 39:26.690
[JAKE] WELL I'VE GOT A LITTLE
THEORY, IF YOU'LL BARE WITH ME.

39:26.740 --> 39:30.950
[FRANCIS] WHAT'S THAT?
[JAKE] WELL IT'S THE 20TH DAY,

39:30.990 --> 39:34.200

39:42.840 --> 39:44.040
EASY.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.750
FILL YOUR BOOTS.

39:45.800 --> 39:47.590
ALTHOUGH I HAVE A
FEELING YOUR NOT GONNA
FIND ANYTHING IN THERE.

39:47.630 --> 39:49.380
[FRANCIS] WHERE IS THE MONEY?

39:50.680 --> 39:54.970
TENS, HUNDREDS, THOUSANDS
OF DOLLARS SKIMMED FROM ME.

39:55.010 --> 39:56.430
WHERE IS THE MONEY?

39:56.470 --> 39:58.560
[JAKE] I'M SORRY FRANCIS, BOY.

39:58.600 --> 40:01.600
I DON'T THINK YOUR BROTHER PUT
ONE DOLLAR IN THAT SAFE.

40:04.440 --> 40:05.820
READ THE LETTER.

40:10.740 --> 40:13.280
[FRANCIS] OH MY GOD.

40:13.320 --> 40:16.950
OH GOD, WHAT A PIECE OF WORK.

40:16.990 --> 40:23.670
HE KILLS A MAN, AND THEN
HE USES MY MONEY
TO EASE HIS CONSCIENCE.

40:23.710 --> 40:28.210
HE'S STILL SCREWING ME!
EVEN FROM SIX FEET UNDER!

40:28.260 --> 40:32.970
[JAKE] WELL THE GOOD NEWS IS,
IT ALL WENT TO CHARITY, EH?

40:33.010 --> 40:36.470
[FRANCIS] CHARITY? MY ASS!
[JAKE] WELL IT'S GOOD TO KNOW

40:36.510 --> 40:39.770
THAT YOU HAVE A SOCIAL
CONSCIOUS.

40:39.810 --> 40:41.560
[JAKE] HE WASN'T HAVING AN
AFFAIR JANET.

40:41.600 --> 40:44.100
[MALACHY] NO SECOND FAMILY,
NO ILLEGITIMATE KIDS.

40:44.150 --> 40:47.980
[JAKE] HE MADE A MISTAKE YEARS
AGO, AND HE WAS USING THE
MONEY AS A WAY TO MAKE AMENDS.

40:48.030 --> 40:48.820
[JANET] WHAT DID HE DO?

40:48.860 --> 40:51.400
WHAT WAS HE TRYING TO PAY FOR?

40:51.450 --> 40:53.160
[JAKE] THE ANSWERS YOU NEED
ARE ALL IN THIS LETTER.

40:53.200 --> 40:56.160
BUT IF I WAS YOU I JUST
WOULDN'T BOTHER OPENING IT.

40:56.200 --> 41:00.160
[MALACHY] JUST REMEMBER HIM
THE WAY HE WAS.

41:00.200 --> 41:02.210
[JAKE] GOOD LUCK OKAY?

41:09.710 --> 41:12.470
&lt;♪♪&gt;

41:14.090 --> 41:16.050
[LESLIE] JAKE, WHERE IS
THIS EVIDENCE?

41:16.100 --> 41:19.520
[JAKE] WELL I DON'T YOU KNOW,
HAVE IT ON MY PERSON PER SAY.

41:19.560 --> 41:20.560
BUT I CAN GET IT...

41:20.600 --> 41:22.730
OR NOT...

41:22.770 --> 41:24.060
DEPENDS.

41:24.100 --> 41:26.690
[LESLIE] THE DOYLE CHAIN OF
CUSTODY, AIRTIGHT.

41:26.730 --> 41:32.070
[JAKE] YEAH LOOK CONSTABLE,
THIS HIT AND RUN RIGHT.
IT WAS 15 YEARS AGO.

41:32.110 --> 41:35.860
THE GUY KILLED HIMSELF.
VICTIM'S WIDOW, SHE JUST WANTS
TO OUT IT BEHIND HER.

41:35.910 --> 41:38.490
[LESLIE] YEAH JAKE
I KNOW, BUT THERE STILL HAS
TO BE AN INVESTIGATION.

41:38.530 --> 41:41.700
[JAKE] CONSTABLE, THE PRESS
ARE GONNA BE ALL OVER
THESE WOMEN, ALRIGHT.

41:41.750 --> 41:45.960
LETS JUST LET SLEEPING DOGS LIE
WHEREVER THEY LIE. WHATEVER.

41:46.000 --> 41:49.090
[LESLIE] JAKE IT'S STUFF LIKE
THIS THAT MAKES ME UNDERSTAND

41:49.130 --> 41:52.130
WHY YOU DIDN'T LAST
ON THE FORCE.

41:54.170 --> 41:55.550
[JAKE] WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

41:55.590 --> 41:57.430
[LESLIE] IT'S A COMPLIMENT!

41:57.470 --> 41:58.850
BUT I STILL HAVE TO
CLOSE THE FILE.

41:58.890 --> 42:00.350
[JAKE] YOU DON'T HAVE TO DO
ANYTHING.

42:00.390 --> 42:03.310
[LESLIE] I'M AFRAID I DO.
[JAKE] REALLY?

42:03.350 --> 42:05.600
WHAT ABOUT YOU AND ME,
HOW WE DOING? WE GOOD?

42:05.640 --> 42:08.060
[LESLIE] YEAH, WE'RE FINE,
WE'RE FRIENDS.

42:08.110 --> 42:10.770
IT'S BETTER THAT WAY
DON'T YOU THINK?

42:10.820 --> 42:13.320
[JAKE] NO. NO
I DON'T THINK, NOT REALLY.

42:13.360 --> 42:14.860
I MEAN...

42:14.900 --> 42:17.160
[MALACHY] CONSTABLE.
[LESLIE] MALACHY.

42:17.200 --> 42:19.200
COFFEE WAS GOOD TODAY.

42:19.240 --> 42:26.620
[MALACHY] YOU'RE WELCOME.
[LESLIE] I WANT THAT EVIDENCE.

42:26.670 --> 42:29.290
[JAKE] SO I DIDN'T HEAR ROSE
THIS MORNING.

42:29.340 --> 42:31.170
I GUESS SHE WISED UP AND BAILED
ON YOU, HUH?

42:31.210 --> 42:36.840
[MALACHY] NOPE, NOT YET.
[JAKE] WHAT YOU GOT THERE?

42:36.880 --> 42:38.640
DID YOU UH...

42:38.680 --> 42:39.760
DECIDE TO CHANGE YOUR WILL?

42:39.800 --> 42:40.850
LEAVE EVERYTHING TO ME?

42:40.890 --> 42:43.600
[MALACHY] FOUND IT IN THE
MAILBOX.

42:43.640 --> 42:46.020
DIVORCE PAPERS.

42:46.060 --> 42:46.730
[JAKE] GET OUT.

42:46.770 --> 42:47.650
FINALLY!

42:47.690 --> 42:50.900
SO MARTIN, HE WISED UP
AND SIGHED, EH?

42:52.860 --> 42:59.780
[ROSE] NO HONEY.
[MALACHY] THEY'RE FROM NIKKI.

42:59.820 --> 43:02.120
[JAKE] OH.

43:02.160 --> 43:03.370
YEAH.

43:07.080 --> 43:08.460
WHAT?

43:08.500 --> 43:14.510
GO MAKE YOURSELF USEFUL,
GO GET ME SOME PANCAKES.

43:21.850 --> 43:26.600
WELL IT LOOKS LIKE SHE DECIDED
TO ACCEPT THE TERMS.

43:31.730 --> 43:34.480
THAT'S GOOD.

43:34.530 --> 43:35.650
THAT'S GOOD.
