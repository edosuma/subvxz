01:33.522 --> 01:34.822
(homer chuckles) Thanks to out new
gps, i can have to the school in no-time.

01:34.890 --> 01:36.891
Female voice:
Turn right in 50 meters.

01:36.958 --> 01:38.459
Oh, meters?!

01:38.527 --> 01:41.228
Dad, a meter is three inches
longer than a yard,

01:41.296 --> 01:42.563
Which is 36 inches,

01:42.631 --> 01:45.399
So 50 divided by 39
times 36 equals...

01:45.467 --> 01:46.600
You have missed your turn.

01:46.668 --> 01:47.968
Recalculating.

01:48.036 --> 01:50.304
Turn right in .5 meters.

01:50.372 --> 01:51.572
Dad, no.

01:51.640 --> 01:53.107
That takes us
into a construction site.

01:53.174 --> 01:55.209
Stupid kid thinks he's
smarter than a computer.

01:56.811 --> 01:58.679
Seat belts, kids.

01:58.747 --> 02:00.748
(tires squealing)

02:00.815 --> 02:03.050
(homer wailing)

02:03.118 --> 02:05.986
Turn left. Turn right.
Turn left. Turn right.

02:06.054 --> 02:08.556
(homer moaning)

02:13.828 --> 02:16.797
Decrease elevation ten feet,
then turn left.

02:16.865 --> 02:17.998
D'oh!

02:19.301 --> 02:21.068
You have reached
your destination.

02:22.337 --> 02:24.004
Thanks for the ride.
Bye, dad!

02:24.072 --> 02:26.874
Turn right in 2.3 kilometers...

02:26.942 --> 02:28.008
Why, you...
(grunts)

02:28.076 --> 02:29.276
Recalculating.

02:29.344 --> 02:32.146
So cold. So cold.
(electronic crackling)

02:32.213 --> 02:34.081
(children laughing and shouting)

02:47.128 --> 02:48.562
(squeaks)

02:49.764 --> 02:51.465
(swallows)

02:51.533 --> 02:53.033
Where's mrs. K.?

02:53.101 --> 02:54.635
Mrs. Krabappel had
to go to portland.

02:54.703 --> 02:55.869
Apparently, the
people she hired

02:55.937 --> 02:57.638
To deprogram her
sister from that cult

02:57.706 --> 02:59.373
Turned out to be an
even worse cult.

02:59.441 --> 03:00.741
So, who's going
to take her place?

03:00.809 --> 03:01.809
Me, I hope.

03:01.876 --> 03:03.911
Not you. Never you.

03:03.979 --> 03:05.813
And due to budget cuts,
until edna comes back,

03:05.880 --> 03:07.448
I have no choice
but to merge

03:07.515 --> 03:09.283
The school's two
fourth grade classes.

03:09.351 --> 03:11.318
(students gasping)
the other fourth grade?

03:11.386 --> 03:13.120
But they're so different
from us.

03:13.188 --> 03:15.322
They have music
on tuesdays.

03:15.390 --> 03:18.058
Their teacher
takes her shoes off.

03:18.126 --> 03:20.561
Their twins are
one boy, one girl.

03:20.629 --> 03:22.196
Weird.

03:25.367 --> 03:27.568
(sighs)
all right, new kids,

03:27.636 --> 03:30.437
Jam your chairs into
my kids' desks.

03:30.505 --> 03:32.640
Is anyone here?
Oh, whatever.

03:32.707 --> 03:34.041
Is anyone here?
Whatever.

03:34.109 --> 03:35.909
Is anyone here?
Whatever.

03:35.977 --> 03:36.977
Is anyone here?
Is anyone here?

03:37.045 --> 03:38.012
Whatever.
Whatever.

03:38.079 --> 03:39.480
'sup? I'm bodhi.

03:39.547 --> 03:41.348
Do you surf?
No.

03:41.416 --> 03:42.916
My parents took me
to hawaii once,

03:42.984 --> 03:44.351
But I was intimidated

03:44.419 --> 03:46.053
By the physiques
of the local kids,

03:46.121 --> 03:48.055
So I just stayed
in the hotel room.

03:48.123 --> 03:49.089
That's cool.

03:49.157 --> 03:50.891
No, it's not cool.

03:50.959 --> 03:52.259
(grunts)

03:54.062 --> 03:56.063
You are so dead.

03:56.131 --> 03:58.098
Sorry. Let me get
that for you.

03:58.166 --> 04:01.135
(gasps)
you're blind.

04:01.202 --> 04:04.104
If anyone messes with this
kid, I will destroy them.

04:04.172 --> 04:05.839
It's okay. No one's
messing with me.

04:05.907 --> 04:07.174
You're not a freak,

04:07.242 --> 04:09.243
And I won't let you
think that about yourself.

04:09.310 --> 04:10.844
I don't think
I'm a freak.

04:10.912 --> 04:12.646
So brave.

04:12.714 --> 04:14.515
Hmm. Huh.

04:14.582 --> 04:16.850
Um, this is the
last seat, so...

04:20.889 --> 04:23.757
My side, your side.

04:23.825 --> 04:24.758
Hi, nikki.

04:24.826 --> 04:25.926
I'm bart.

04:25.994 --> 04:27.528
This situation,
it's nuts, right?

04:27.595 --> 04:29.129
Oh, look at you--

04:29.197 --> 04:31.398
Opening a book so you
won't have to talk to me.

04:31.466 --> 04:34.368
Well, I'm just going to be
tuning up the old armpit.

04:34.436 --> 04:35.536
(blows tone)

04:35.603 --> 04:37.738
(mimics sound
of passing gas)

04:37.806 --> 04:39.206
Good news, children.

04:39.274 --> 04:41.542
Everyone did well on this test,
except...

04:41.609 --> 04:43.777
Lisa simpson, f.

04:43.845 --> 04:45.045
An f?!

04:45.113 --> 04:47.514
Okay, this is the time
when I always wake up.

04:47.582 --> 04:49.983
Come on, alarm clock,
get me out of this.

04:50.051 --> 04:53.020
(imitates blaring alarm)

04:53.088 --> 04:55.689
Sorry, lisa--
this f is all too real.

04:55.757 --> 04:57.758
No it's not,
dream hoover.

04:57.826 --> 05:00.160
And as long as I'm asleep,
I'm going to have some fun.

05:00.228 --> 05:01.228
I can fly!

05:01.296 --> 05:02.362
Wheeee!

05:02.430 --> 05:04.565
(grunts, groans)

05:04.632 --> 05:06.200
This isn't a dream.

05:06.267 --> 05:08.001
I really did fail.

05:08.069 --> 05:09.903
I take no joy in this.

05:09.971 --> 05:11.171
(muttering):
Little miss perfect.

05:12.474 --> 05:13.907
Bart:
Whoa.

05:13.975 --> 05:16.410
Damn, this
caterpillar can eat.

05:16.478 --> 05:18.178
(gasps) damn.

05:18.246 --> 05:19.913
Damn!

05:19.981 --> 05:21.782
Do you mind?

05:21.850 --> 05:25.152
Oh, man, you girls ruin
everything-- even vampires.

05:25.220 --> 05:27.721
Hey, vampires
are cool outsiders

05:27.789 --> 05:29.990
Who love girls
who hate cheerleaders.

05:30.058 --> 05:32.226
No, they're all
about chomping neck.

05:32.293 --> 05:33.994
And they don't put
product in their hair

05:34.062 --> 05:35.095
Like this loser.

05:36.931 --> 05:38.866
They look like this.

05:40.168 --> 05:41.935
Nikki:
Awesome picture.

05:42.003 --> 05:43.637
Can I draw a robot
barfing screws

05:43.705 --> 05:45.139
On your arm with
my sharpie?

05:45.206 --> 05:47.441
I... I'd like that.

05:50.245 --> 05:51.745
(laughing)

05:51.813 --> 05:54.181
And... Finished.

05:57.585 --> 05:59.253
An f. An f!

05:59.320 --> 06:01.755
I hope harvard never finds out
about this.

06:01.823 --> 06:03.757
(whirring)

06:06.561 --> 06:07.828
Huh?

06:07.896 --> 06:09.563
Can I teeter
while you totter?

06:09.631 --> 06:11.064
Ever since you got
that bad grade,

06:11.132 --> 06:12.599
You seem a lot cooler.

06:12.667 --> 06:15.035
Lisa, you want
to come skip rope?

06:15.103 --> 06:16.136
You can replace the tree.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.171
Eat lunch with me.

06:17.238 --> 06:18.438
Share my locker.

06:18.506 --> 06:20.107
Come to my
birthday party.

06:20.175 --> 06:21.909
Love me.

06:21.976 --> 06:24.411
Wow. This is kind of great.

06:24.479 --> 06:26.380
Lisa, can I speak
to you for a moment?

06:26.447 --> 06:27.614
Uh-oh.

06:27.682 --> 06:30.117
Looks like I'm in more trouble.

06:30.185 --> 06:31.485
(chuckles)

06:31.553 --> 06:33.220
Born to be bad.

06:33.288 --> 06:35.155
(children laughing)

06:35.223 --> 06:36.824
There was a mix-up
with your test.

06:36.891 --> 06:38.292
(sighs)
you got

06:38.359 --> 06:40.093
An a-triple-plus.
Seems the f

06:40.161 --> 06:41.228
Belonged to ralph.

06:41.296 --> 06:42.663
I cheated wrong.

06:42.730 --> 06:46.466
I copied the lisa name
and used the ralph answers.

06:48.870 --> 06:51.805
Children:
Gifted! Gifted! Gifted!

06:51.873 --> 06:53.207
I'm just advanced.

06:53.274 --> 06:54.675
You can catch up.

06:54.742 --> 06:56.243
Children:
Gifted!

06:56.311 --> 06:59.279
Dad, I know we don't normally
talk about this stuff,

06:59.347 --> 07:01.915
But there's this girl at school
I kind of like.

07:01.983 --> 07:05.118
Anyway, I'm really
hoping you could...

07:05.186 --> 07:06.386
Dad?

07:06.454 --> 07:07.654
Hey, boy.
(screams)

07:07.722 --> 07:08.622
(chuckles)
your mother thinks

07:08.690 --> 07:10.057
I'm working on the car.

07:10.124 --> 07:12.759
Dad, that is genius,
but I need some advice.

07:12.827 --> 07:13.994
Homer?

07:14.062 --> 07:15.996
I thought you
were fixing my brakes.

07:16.064 --> 07:18.599
(panicked screaming)

07:18.666 --> 07:20.500
But I need to talk
about man stuff.

07:20.568 --> 07:21.835
Talk to grampa.

07:21.903 --> 07:23.470
He used to
be a man.
He did?

07:23.538 --> 07:25.172
(grunting)

07:25.240 --> 07:28.275
Give up the goods,
you yellow devil!

07:28.343 --> 07:30.310
So, I kind of like this girl
at school,

07:30.378 --> 07:32.512
But I'm not sure
if she likes me back.

07:32.580 --> 07:35.115
There's one sure
way to find out

07:35.183 --> 07:37.985
If a girl likes
you-- steal a kiss.

07:38.052 --> 07:39.186
Really?

07:39.254 --> 07:40.787
Did that ever work for you?

07:40.855 --> 07:41.955
Sure did.

07:42.023 --> 07:45.592
I remember it
like it was yesterday.

07:45.660 --> 07:47.494
(static crackling)

07:49.230 --> 07:50.497
Uh-oh.

07:55.670 --> 07:56.737
Whoa.

07:56.804 --> 07:58.405
She boards, too?!

08:00.575 --> 08:02.809
¶ ¶

08:18.326 --> 08:20.661
¶ ¶

08:32.373 --> 08:33.840
So...

08:33.908 --> 08:35.509
What should we do now?

08:35.576 --> 08:38.445
Kiss her, ya idjit!

08:40.048 --> 08:41.515
(sighs)

08:41.582 --> 08:42.783
(shrieks)

08:42.850 --> 08:46.086
Bart simpson kissed me.

08:46.154 --> 08:49.089
Oh, my god,
and that was my first kiss.

08:49.157 --> 08:52.092
It will always be my first kiss.

08:52.160 --> 08:53.360
Ew.

08:58.232 --> 08:59.466
Say, "haw-haw."

08:59.534 --> 09:00.667
Haw-haw.

09:00.735 --> 09:02.736
That was great!

09:02.804 --> 09:04.438
Really great!

09:10.158 --> 09:12.960
Marge, homer, this is brody
and madison mckenna.

09:13.027 --> 09:15.195
Bart has been sharing a desk
with their daughter, nikki.

09:15.263 --> 09:18.465
Earlier today, your son
engaged in inappropriate

09:18.533 --> 09:20.634
Mouth-on-mouth contact
with our daughter.

09:21.803 --> 09:24.037
You mean, he kissed her?

09:24.105 --> 09:27.741
- On the top of the slide.
- That's all that happened?

09:27.809 --> 09:29.209
And I got to miss work?!

09:29.277 --> 09:31.311
(chuckles):
Oh, I could kiss you.

09:31.379 --> 09:33.647
Mr. Simpson,
I'm an attorney,

09:33.715 --> 09:35.616
And my husband is
a federal prosecutor,

09:35.683 --> 09:37.451
And neither of us is happy.

09:37.518 --> 09:40.454
Well, maybe you guys
should look for easier jobs.

09:40.521 --> 09:42.389
Unless you make this

09:42.457 --> 09:43.924
An affection-free
environment,

09:43.992 --> 09:46.093
We will sue this school
for its last dime.

09:46.160 --> 09:47.761
All right, here it is.

09:47.829 --> 09:49.663
<i>And we will make you
regret the day</i>

09:49.731 --> 09:51.064
Your son was born.

09:51.132 --> 09:52.332
You're halfway home, lady.

09:56.437 --> 09:57.604
It's not my fault.

09:57.672 --> 09:59.306
Grampa told me to kiss her.

09:59.374 --> 10:02.009
Why didn't you just tell
him to club her on the head

10:02.076 --> 10:03.477
And drag her into a cave?

10:03.544 --> 10:05.879
You mean second base?

10:05.947 --> 10:07.981
Whoa, he's a little
young for that.

10:08.049 --> 10:09.750
Well, if I talk to nikki,
I'm sure I can...

10:09.817 --> 10:11.752
No! If you go near her
one more time,

10:11.819 --> 10:13.186
We'll be sued
into the poor house

10:13.254 --> 10:14.554
And have to eat
garbage forever.

10:14.622 --> 10:15.756
That's no problem.

10:15.823 --> 10:17.224
Mom can make garbage
taste great.

10:17.292 --> 10:18.592
Thank you.

10:18.660 --> 10:19.960
Well, I mean it.

10:20.028 --> 10:22.596
And it means
the world to me.

10:22.664 --> 10:24.064
Well, don't worry, boy.

10:24.132 --> 10:27.334
I know a wholesome way
to take your mind off girls.

10:27.402 --> 10:29.136
(screaming)

10:29.203 --> 10:30.837
This is awesome!

10:30.905 --> 10:33.006
If only real life
was in 3-d.

10:33.074 --> 10:34.641
(chuckles)
and the glasses smell

10:34.709 --> 10:36.877
Like the last guy who
wore them had pizza.

10:55.730 --> 10:57.264
(grunts)

11:12.547 --> 11:14.948
(yelling)

11:15.016 --> 11:17.951
(yell echoing)

11:51.586 --> 11:53.053
(squawking)

11:53.121 --> 11:55.022
(gunshots)
ha, ha!

11:55.089 --> 11:56.523
(both laughing)
look at that.

11:56.591 --> 11:57.958
Oh, look at their guts.

11:58.026 --> 11:59.526
He has blood
all over him.

11:59.594 --> 12:01.528
(rapid typing on keyboard)

12:01.596 --> 12:04.297
Lisa:
"dear fellow
organic gardening enthusiasts,

12:04.365 --> 12:05.966
"I'm afraid I am too sad

12:06.034 --> 12:07.934
"to post my list
of garden-friendly snails.

12:08.002 --> 12:09.836
"yet again, I have seen
the bitter truth

12:09.904 --> 12:13.040
"of how difficult it is
to be smart and accepted.

12:13.107 --> 12:16.143
<i>With mulch love-- lisa simpson."</i>

12:16.210 --> 12:18.245
(laughs weakly)
mulch love. That's cute.

12:18.312 --> 12:19.246
(computer chimes)

12:19.313 --> 12:20.881
Somebody posted a comment?

12:20.948 --> 12:23.850
"don't stop achieving
just yet, lisa.

12:23.918 --> 12:26.887
You are not alone. Flotus1."

12:26.954 --> 12:28.622
Huh? Flotus1?

12:28.689 --> 12:29.956
Who could that be?

12:30.024 --> 12:31.391
Skinner (over p.A.):
Attention, all students.

12:31.459 --> 12:32.726
Please report

12:32.794 --> 12:34.194
To an attorney-mandated
school assembly.

12:34.262 --> 12:36.029
To make time for this,

12:36.097 --> 12:38.565
<i>The third grade's performance
of my fair lady is cancelled.</i>

12:38.633 --> 12:40.834
(with british accent):
I say, that's rum news.

12:40.902 --> 12:42.736
Very rum, indeed.

12:45.373 --> 12:47.207
By now you've probably heard

12:47.275 --> 12:49.509
That one of our fourth graders
did something

12:49.577 --> 12:51.111
That a hundred years ago

12:51.179 --> 12:53.313
Would've been considered
innocent, but in today's

12:53.381 --> 12:55.649
Overly-litigious society

12:55.716 --> 12:58.552
Has been blown completely
out of proportion.

12:58.619 --> 13:00.420
Now, what he said was...

13:00.488 --> 13:01.955
<i>I can hear.</i>

13:02.023 --> 13:05.058
The following skit, or sketch,

13:05.126 --> 13:06.993
Demonstrates the behavior

13:07.061 --> 13:09.396
We wish you would save
for middle school.

13:09.464 --> 13:11.331
And... Action!

13:11.399 --> 13:12.933
(light piano tune plays)

13:13.000 --> 13:17.237
Oh, I'm just a wee little lass,
combin' me beautiful hair.

13:17.305 --> 13:20.540
¶ comb, comb, comb-ery doo... ¶

13:20.608 --> 13:23.276
I'm bart simpson,
disruptive fourth-grader.

13:23.344 --> 13:26.246
Oh! I finally caught one
of bart's school plays.

13:26.314 --> 13:27.647
That's not bart.

13:27.715 --> 13:29.249
It's principal skinner.

13:29.317 --> 13:31.151
Bart's sitting
right next to you.

13:31.219 --> 13:33.120
Yeah, now that I look closer,

13:33.187 --> 13:35.155
That guy couldn't fool anybody.

13:35.223 --> 13:37.057
Shut up, fatso.

13:37.125 --> 13:39.292
Why you little...
(grunting)
(choking)

13:39.360 --> 13:41.061
(snaps fingers)
(homer grunts)

13:41.129 --> 13:43.296
(grunting and mumbling)

13:43.364 --> 13:47.200
Now, players, recreate
the incident in question.

13:47.268 --> 13:49.202
Ick. Ugh.

13:49.270 --> 13:50.537
(kissing sounds)

13:50.605 --> 13:53.206
Hey, willie,
does he taste like failure?

13:53.274 --> 13:54.908
(laughter)

13:54.976 --> 13:56.710
Stop that laughter!

13:56.777 --> 13:58.645
(laughter)

13:58.713 --> 14:01.581
I can make these two kiss
all day, if I have to.

14:01.649 --> 14:03.116
Hmm?

14:03.184 --> 14:04.317
(grunts)

14:05.887 --> 14:09.389
If you want them to keep
on kissing, just keep laughing.

14:09.457 --> 14:11.491
(laughter continues)

14:14.028 --> 14:15.195
(laughter continues)

14:15.263 --> 14:16.663
(laughter fading)

14:22.470 --> 14:23.703
(bart sighs)

14:23.771 --> 14:25.438
Maybe I did do something wrong.

14:27.175 --> 14:28.542
(gasps)

14:28.609 --> 14:31.578
Oh, bart, I hate
to see you like this.

14:31.646 --> 14:33.313
(sighs)

14:33.381 --> 14:36.816
- Look who's all confused.
- Huh?

14:39.304 --> 14:40.604
What the hell
are you doing?

14:40.672 --> 14:41.939
I'm kissing you, stupid.

14:42.007 --> 14:43.808
You're the biggest
psycho I ever met.

14:43.875 --> 14:44.975
You want to stop?

14:45.043 --> 14:46.177
Absolutely not.

14:46.244 --> 14:47.378
(sighs)

14:49.581 --> 14:52.082
(willie humming)

14:52.150 --> 14:54.151
(groaning)

14:58.089 --> 14:59.790
(gasps)

14:59.858 --> 15:01.892
A vh-60n whitehawk!

15:08.533 --> 15:09.834
(children gasping)

15:13.572 --> 15:16.073
First lady
michelle obama?!

15:16.141 --> 15:17.007
(spits)

15:21.646 --> 15:23.714
I flew in from turkmenistan

15:23.782 --> 15:27.051
Because there's
a wonderful young person here

15:27.118 --> 15:29.220
Who's feeling
a little discouraged.

15:29.287 --> 15:30.521
I sure am!

15:30.589 --> 15:32.089
This young lady...

15:32.157 --> 15:33.457
Oh.

15:33.525 --> 15:35.459
...Thinks just because
she's a high achiever,

15:35.527 --> 15:37.061
No one will ever like her.

15:37.128 --> 15:38.028
Huh?

15:38.096 --> 15:39.530
Well, as I tell schoolchildren

15:39.598 --> 15:42.399
All over the world,
I was a high achiever.

15:42.467 --> 15:45.836
I got a's back
when a's were hard to get.

15:45.904 --> 15:48.539
I was just like lisa simpson.

15:48.607 --> 15:49.874
(gasps)

15:49.941 --> 15:51.408
That's right, lisa.

15:51.476 --> 15:54.678
As an avid organic gardener,
I've read your blog.

15:54.746 --> 15:59.049
Flotus1 is first lady
of the United States one!

15:59.117 --> 16:00.417
Yes.

16:00.485 --> 16:02.519
I wanted just "flotus,"
but someone had it.

16:02.587 --> 16:05.689
That's me, 'cause I swim
with my flotuses on.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.759
Everything I have
I got through academics.

16:08.827 --> 16:11.862
I went to chicago's
first magnet high school,

16:11.930 --> 16:14.398
Then princeton,
then harvard law.

16:14.466 --> 16:18.269
And now you're the most elegant
and popular woman in the world!

16:18.336 --> 16:19.603
Well...

16:19.671 --> 16:21.138
(laughing) I don't
know about that.

16:21.206 --> 16:23.340
There's carla bruni,
queen noor of jordan...

16:23.408 --> 16:25.743
They're nothing compared to you.

16:25.810 --> 16:27.344
It's not a contest.

16:27.412 --> 16:29.847
But if it were, I think
we know how it would go.

16:29.915 --> 16:34.051
But before I was who I am today,
I was a nerd.

16:34.119 --> 16:35.786
So the lesson is, children...

16:35.854 --> 16:37.421
I'll tell them
what the lesson is.

16:37.489 --> 16:38.722
He's our joe biden.

16:38.790 --> 16:40.557
Understood. So kids,

16:40.625 --> 16:43.494
Be nice to lisa,
because the overachievers

16:43.561 --> 16:45.663
Will someday
be running the country,

16:45.730 --> 16:47.865
And you don't want them
to be too screwed up.

16:47.933 --> 16:49.700
Now, who else is
an overachiever?

16:49.768 --> 16:50.801
Come on, now!

16:52.003 --> 16:53.237
I am.

16:53.305 --> 16:55.172
I am, too.

16:55.240 --> 16:56.974
Fifth in my class
at annapolis.

16:57.042 --> 16:58.709
Scaled the summit
of the highest peaks

16:58.777 --> 17:00.544
On six of seven continents.

17:00.612 --> 17:02.613
Hey, that's great.

17:02.681 --> 17:04.214
Don't forget to
bring the scooper

17:04.281 --> 17:05.683
When you
walk the dog.

17:05.750 --> 17:06.916
Ma'am, yes, ma'am!

17:06.984 --> 17:07.851
Now, let's roll.

17:09.054 --> 17:10.154
(grunting)

17:10.221 --> 17:11.555
Sorry, ma'am.

17:11.623 --> 17:13.857
We can't seem to reopen
the hatch to the copter.

17:16.528 --> 17:18.028
You were saying?

17:18.096 --> 17:19.630
Oh, well, I loosened it up.

17:23.435 --> 17:25.169
<i>That is the most amazing thing</i>

17:25.236 --> 17:27.104
That's ever happened
to this school.

17:27.172 --> 17:29.907
(laughs) well, yeah, till
they find out about us.

17:29.975 --> 17:31.642
What do you mean "us"?

17:31.710 --> 17:35.045
Well, like, uh,
a-aren't you my girlfriend now?

17:35.113 --> 17:36.714
Oh, you mean,
like you own me?

17:36.781 --> 17:38.182
I'm sorry.

17:38.249 --> 17:40.551
Ugh! You're always
apologizing.

17:40.618 --> 17:41.885
Just tell me
what you want!

17:41.953 --> 17:43.454
<i>You should know
what I want!</i>

17:43.521 --> 17:46.857
I want you to act the same
way two days in a row! Ugh!

17:46.925 --> 17:49.360
I'm not gonna let
you hurt me anymore.

17:49.427 --> 17:50.494
(screams, thuds)

17:51.730 --> 17:55.799
(crying):
He's dead!
I love him!

17:55.867 --> 17:58.502
(breathing loudly)
Oh, he's breathing.

17:58.570 --> 17:59.970
Loser.

18:05.421 --> 18:06.822
He's stopped breathin'!

18:06.890 --> 18:08.223
Who knows gob-to-gob?!

18:08.291 --> 18:11.593
You know, mutton hole
to mutton hole.

18:11.661 --> 18:14.429
No one goes near that boy
till the ambulance comes.

18:14.497 --> 18:18.133
Any physical contact violates
our school's no-touch policy.

18:18.201 --> 18:20.469
Let's quickly prod him to the
curb with this pool skimmer.

18:20.537 --> 18:21.570
Good thinking.

18:24.641 --> 18:25.574
Move!

18:25.642 --> 18:26.842
I know cpr!

18:26.910 --> 18:28.277
Nikki, no!

18:28.344 --> 18:30.445
I prefer a dead child
to a lawsuit from your parents.

19:27.637 --> 19:29.972
(cheering)

19:30.039 --> 19:31.807
Ugh! Ya call that a kiss?

19:31.874 --> 19:34.343
Come here.
(whimpering)

19:34.410 --> 19:35.811
(children chattering)

19:35.878 --> 19:38.480
Nelson, now that
the ban's been lifted,

19:38.548 --> 19:40.015
Let me touch your face.

19:40.083 --> 19:42.884
That way, I can see you
with my fingers.

19:45.121 --> 19:47.589
Ew! I said your face,
not your butt!

19:47.657 --> 19:50.492
Oh, you feel comfortable
enough to mock me.

19:50.560 --> 19:51.793
(grunts)
(groans)

19:51.861 --> 19:53.495
That's for mocking me.

19:53.563 --> 19:57.366
Nelson, your punch
restored my vision!

19:57.433 --> 19:59.167
I can see again!

19:59.235 --> 20:00.936
Really? Kevin,
that's wonder...

20:01.004 --> 20:02.371
Sync By YesCool
www.addic7ed.com

20:02.438 --> 20:05.040
The student has
become the master!

20:05.108 --> 20:07.876
Nikki, thanks for
saving my life.

20:07.944 --> 20:09.678
Look, can we just pretend
that never happened?

20:09.746 --> 20:11.246
I don't want
everyone at school

20:11.314 --> 20:13.048
To go around
thinking I like you.

20:13.116 --> 20:14.283
I don't get you.

20:14.350 --> 20:15.384
You're hot,
you're cold.

20:15.451 --> 20:16.685
What is your deal?!

20:16.753 --> 20:18.320
Oh, bart, you've got
a few things

20:18.388 --> 20:20.022
To learn about women.

20:20.089 --> 20:22.224
And I will never
tell you what they are.

20:22.292 --> 20:28.330
I give up. Smell ya later.
(sighs)

20:31.701 --> 20:33.190
I love you!
