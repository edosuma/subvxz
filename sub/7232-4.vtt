ABOUT THAT.

12:14.400 --> 12:16.152
- I'M NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE SPRINKLES!

I'M TALKING ABOUT LEAVING
THE REFRIGERATOR DOOR OPEN,

12:18.779 --> 12:19.989
WASTING ELECTRICITY!

12:20.072 --> 12:21.824

WASTING ELECTRICITY

12:21.907 --> 12:24.410
TO PUT A SECURITY CAMERA
INSIDE A REFRIGERATOR?

A BATTERY THAT CREATES SAFE
AND LIMITLESS ENERGY.

13:12.958 --> 13:13.584
- WHAT'S THE POWER SOURCE?

13:59.463 --> 14:00.172
WHEN YOU TAKE OUT THE CHIP.

- MONSTERS, DO SOMETHING!

14:04.051 --> 14:05.261
I DO NOT WANT TO EXPLAIN
TO THE PRESIDENT

14:05.344 --> 14:08.389

IS THAT UNDERSTOOD?

15:18.167 --> 15:20.252
- SURE, I GUESS.

15:20.336 --> 15:22.212
- A COMPLETE SUCCESS.

15:22.296 --> 15:23.464
THEY'LL GIVE ME A SEAT

15:23.547 --> 15:25.799

- B.O.B., EAT WHAT'S INSIDE
THE VENDING MACHINE,

15:50.366 --> 15:51.575
NOT THE VENDING MACHINE
ITSELF.

15:51.659 --> 15:53.035
- ARE YOU SURE?

15:53.118 --> 15:56.246
HAVE YOU SEEN SOME OF THE JUNK
THAT PASSES FOR FOOD IN HERE?

15:56.330 --> 15:57.289
- POINT TAKEN.

16:01.335 --> 16:03.712
- CANNONBALL!

16:03.796 --> 16:05.005
- IS THAT B.O.B.?

16:05.089 --> 16:06.674
- THE GENERAL SAYS
WE USE TOO MUCH ENERGY

800,000 GALLONS!

16:34.535 --> 16:36.286
- THE SHAMPOO PEOPLE
SHOULD REALLY PUT A LIMIT

16:36.370 --> 16:37.663
ON "RINSE AND REPEAT," SIR.

16:37.746 --> 16:39.748
- THAT'S WHY WE NEED
TO STAY VIGILANT, B.O.B.

16:39.832 --> 16:42.251
CAN'T LET ANYTHING GET PAST US.

16:46.422 --> 16:49.466
[laughter]

16:57.015 --> 16:57.891

17:12.364 --> 17:13.281
- B.O.B.?

17:13.365 --> 17:14.867
HE WAS IN THE POOL WITH LINK.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.993
HAVE YOU NOTICED HE'S BEEN
ACTING A LITTLE WEIRD TODAY?

17:17.077 --> 17:21.165
- I'M SURE EVERYTHING IS FINE

17:21.248 --> 17:21.582
AND UNDER CONTROL.

17:21.665 --> 17:23.375
BYE!

17:23.459 --> 17:25.502

WHAT'S HAPPENING TO YOU?

17:39.892 --> 17:41.518
- I DON'T KNOW.

17:41.602 --> 17:43.395
OH, WHO ARE THESE
HANDSOME FELLOWS?

17:43.479 --> 17:45.647
- AW, THANKS.

17:45.731 --> 17:46.690
- DID HE JUST GET SHORTER?

17:46.774 --> 17:48.650
- SUSAN, LINK,
MIGHT I HAVE A WORD?

17:48.734 --> 17:51.111
B.O.B. IS IN GRAVE DANGER.

17:51.195 --> 17:53.322
THESE OTHER B.O.B.s
AREN'T SIMPLY COPIES;

17:53.405 --> 17:55.491
THEY'RE QUANTUM-ENTANGLED PARTS
OF HIS ESSENCE.

17:55.574 --> 17:56.784
- THAT'S JUST
WHAT I WAS THINKING.

17:56.867 --> 17:57.826
I WAS LIKE--

17:57.910 --> 17:58.827
OH, SORRY.
WHAT NOW?

17:58.911 --> 18:00.245
- THE MORE THERE ARE OF THEM,

18:00.329 --> 18:02.164
THE LESS THERE IS OF B.O.B.
TO GO AROUND.

18:02.247 --> 18:05.042
- SO WHERE ARE THEY COMING FROM?

18:05.125 --> 18:06.043

WHICH IS REALLY NOT COMFORTABLE
FOR EITHER OF US.

ISN'T THAT RIGHT,

18:28.941 --> 18:29.983
- WHICH ONE?

18:30.067 --> 18:31.568
- THERE'S A LOT OF THEM
GOING AROUND.

18:31.652 --> 18:34.279

18:34.363 --> 18:35.239
[gasps]

18:35.322 --> 18:38.325
HOW EVER DID THAT GET THERE?

18:38.408 --> 18:40.202
- WOW,
I JUST GOT HERE,

18:40.285 --> 18:42.746
AND I CAN ALREADY TELL
THAT GUY'S A TERRIBLE LIAR.

18:42.830 --> 18:44.957
- OKAY, YES, FINE.

18:45.040 --> 18:46.375
I WAS CLONING B.O.B.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.668
- WHY?

18:47.751 --> 18:50.379
- WOULD YOU BELIEVE
I SOMETIMES GET TERRIBLY LONELY?

18:50.462 --> 18:51.213
- EITHER THAT,
OR YOU WERE TRYING

18:51.296 --> 18:53.131
TO CLONE AN ARMY OF B.O.B.s,

18:53.215 --> 18:53.799
BUT EVEN YOU AREN'T THAT STUPID.

18:53.882 --> 18:56.885
- [nervous laughter]

18:56.969 --> 18:58.220
YES, RIGHT.

18:58.303 --> 19:00.389
ARMY OF B.O.B.s.
HEH.

19:00.472 --> 19:01.390
- THE ESSENCE OF GENUINE B.O.B.

19:01.473 --> 19:03.684
IS GETTING STRETCHED
PERILOUSLY THIN!

19:03.767 --> 19:06.645
IF WE DON'T GET EVERY LAST BIT
OF B.O.B. BACK TOGETHER,

19:06.728 --> 19:08.438
HE MAY CEASE TO EXIST.

19:08.522 --> 19:09.731
- COME ON, COVERTON.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.233
YOU'RE HELPING US
WRANGLE UP THE B.O.B.s.

19:11.316 --> 19:12.693
- OH, BUT I REALLY--
- COME ON!

19:20.659 --> 19:22.619
[laughter]

19:27.040 --> 19:28.166
- OOH.

19:31.879 --> 19:33.380
all: HI, B.O.B.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.715
- HEY, GUYS.

19:34.798 --> 19:37.426
SORRY, SUSAN,
I'M NOT UP FOR A PARTY TODAY.

19:37.509 --> 19:39.887
JUST WANT TO CLOSE MY EYE...

19:39.970 --> 19:41.763
- OH, NO, HE'S GETTING WORSE.

19:41.847 --> 19:43.891
WHY DIDN'T THIS STOP
WHEN WE TURNED OFF THE MACHINE?

19:43.974 --> 19:45.434
- HE'S FAR TOO DIMINISHED.

19:45.517 --> 19:46.768
HE CAN'T SUSTAIN HIMSELF.

19:46.852 --> 19:49.354
WE NEED TO REVERSE THE PROCESS
IMMEDIATELY.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.856
- OH, IS REVERSE
SOMETHING THEY TEACH

19:50.939 --> 19:54.109
IN MAD SCIENCE SCHOOL?

19:54.192 --> 19:55.611
- YOU MESSED WITH MY BUDDY.

19:55.694 --> 19:57.738
NOW FIX HIM,
OR ELSE I'LL FIX YOU!

19:57.821 --> 19:59.281
- I DON'T KNOW HOW!

19:59.364 --> 20:01.116
MY MACHINE WAS ONLY MADE
TO DUPLICATE,

20:01.199 --> 20:02.159
NOT MERGE.

20:02.242 --> 20:03.702
- MERGE.
- YES, I SAID "MERGE."

20:03.785 --> 20:06.121
- MERGE.
- MERGE.

20:06.204 --> 20:07.289
- MERGE.

20:07.372 --> 20:08.707
- I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE SAYING IT RIGHT.

20:08.790 --> 20:09.333
MERGE.

20:09.416 --> 20:11.126
- THAT'S IT!

20:11.209 --> 20:11.835
I KNOW HOW TO GET B.O.B.
TO MERGE WITH HIMSELF!

20:11.919 --> 20:13.962
- B.O.B., WAKE UP.

20:14.046 --> 20:15.130
- YOU NEED TO EAT SOMETHING,
BUDDY.

20:15.213 --> 20:15.839
- WHAT?
- THAT GUY.

20:15.923 --> 20:18.550
- COME ON, BRO.
EAT ME!

20:18.634 --> 20:20.177
- MM.
I DON'T FEEL LIKE MYSELF.

20:20.260 --> 20:22.804
- WHAT IF WE PUT SPRINKLES
ON HIM?

20:22.888 --> 20:25.140
- SPRINKLES?

20:25.223 --> 20:26.308
SURE YOU DON'T MIND?

20:26.391 --> 20:28.268
- DUDE, I INSIST.

20:28.352 --> 20:30.896
- [slurping]

20:30.979 --> 20:32.189
I'M PRETTY SWEET.

20:32.272 --> 20:33.523
- YOU KNOW HOW
WE ALWAYS TELL YOU

20:33.607 --> 20:34.191
NOT TO EAT TOO MUCH, B.O.B.?

20:34.274 --> 20:36.610
TODAY, FORGET THAT RULE.

20:36.693 --> 20:38.487
- AH!
WHAT RULE?

20:38.570 --> 20:39.738
- B.O.B. APPETIT!

20:39.821 --> 20:43.200
- WHOO-HOO!

20:43.283 --> 20:44.618
GET IT THERE, B.O.B.!

20:44.701 --> 20:47.162
- SPRINKLES!

20:47.245 --> 20:49.331
[chomping and laughter]

21:01.218 --> 21:02.678
I'M SO FULL.

21:02.761 --> 21:03.845
I COULD NOT EAT ANOTHER ME.

21:03.929 --> 21:06.056
- JUST ONE MORE, B.O.B.

21:06.139 --> 21:07.182
YOU CAN DO THIS.

21:07.265 --> 21:09.101
- YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I CAN.

21:09.184 --> 21:10.352
chomp!

21:10.435 --> 21:12.562
- WELL, THERE YOU HAVE IT,
ANOTHER PROBLEM SOLVED.

21:12.646 --> 21:13.814
- UH, GUYS?

21:13.897 --> 21:16.733
THERE'S SOME SERIOUS TUMMY FUNNY
GOING ON HERE.

21:16.817 --> 21:18.151
- OH, DEAR.

21:18.235 --> 21:20.195
- THIS ISN'T GONNA BE GOOD,
IS IT?

21:20.278 --> 21:21.947
- THE B.O.B.s
AREN'T REINTEGRATING.

21:22.030 --> 21:25.993
IT'S POSSIBLE THAT HE'S JUST
BECOME ONE GIANT, UNSTABLE MASS.

21:26.076 --> 21:28.662
- [rumbling, grunting]

21:28.745 --> 21:32.249
[belches]

21:33.291 --> 21:35.419
- OR IT WAS JUST GAS.

21:35.502 --> 21:36.378
- WHOO!

21:36.461 --> 21:38.630
OH, I FEEL SO MUCH BETTER.

21:38.714 --> 21:40.590
- B.O.B.!

21:40.674 --> 21:41.883
YOU'RE ALL RIGHT!

21:41.967 --> 21:43.719
- YEAH, I NEED TO CUT BACK
ON THE SPRINKLES.

21:43.802 --> 21:44.845
- I CONCUR.
