"Oh, I think you're cute."

15:36.368 --> 15:38.037
I can't do that.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.039
{\an5}Why?

15:38.103 --> 15:40.039
{\an1}I'm terrified
of stuff like--

15:40.105 --> 15:41.740
I'm terrified
of rejection.

15:41.807 --> 15:44.076
Jeremiah's having nothing
but good intentions.

15:44.143 --> 15:46.545
He's trying to build
my self confidence,

15:46.612 --> 15:49.748
but he doesn't know what it's
like to be treated like (bleep)

15:49.815 --> 15:51.116
because of what
you look like.

15:51.183 --> 15:53.352
You have to be able
to open yourself.

15:53.419 --> 15:54.887
{\an1}Jeremiah,
you're a good looking guy.

15:54.953 --> 15:57.089
{\an1}You are.
I don't feel like that.

15:57.156 --> 15:59.358
You know, I feel a lot better
about myself

15:59.425 --> 16:03.495
than I did last summer,
but I still don't feel pretty.

16:03.562 --> 16:05.164
I wish I could be
as strong as you.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.900
{\an1}I wish I could do that,
but I'm just not like that.

16:07.966 --> 16:10.002
I'm not comfortable
in my own skin yet.

16:10.069 --> 16:11.203
I'm really not.

16:11.270 --> 16:14.573
{\an1}I don't--
I don't move quickly.

16:14.640 --> 16:16.508
{\an1}I don't move quickly,
and I'm...

16:16.575 --> 16:18.777
{\an1}I don't love my ex anymore.
I don't.

16:18.844 --> 16:22.915
But I'm not over past issues,
and I don't love myself yet.

16:22.981 --> 16:24.950
Aimee's always had
a confidence issue,

16:25.017 --> 16:27.252
but, like, this is a side
I haven't seen.

16:27.319 --> 16:29.355
And I want to make sure that
I help her through this.

16:29.421 --> 16:31.623
You had your heart broken.

16:31.690 --> 16:33.192
You (bleep) outgrew that,

16:33.258 --> 16:35.427
{\an1}and you became stronger
as a woman.

16:37.429 --> 16:38.731
{\an1}Am I right?
Or am I wrong?

16:38.797 --> 16:41.367
I don't love myself
like I should.

16:41.433 --> 16:43.369
And Jeremiah sees that.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.504
{\an1}All that stuff that
happened in the past.

16:45.571 --> 16:47.673
{\an1}I want you to
(bleep) let that (bleep)

16:47.740 --> 16:50.542
{\an1}roll off your shoulder,
and forget about it.

16:50.609 --> 16:52.611
{\an1}Because, girl,
I see that look in your eye

16:52.678 --> 16:55.981
and it's absolutely gorgeous.

16:56.048 --> 16:57.716
Me and Jeremiah
aren't that close,

16:57.783 --> 16:59.651
so I think that that's
a really nice

16:59.718 --> 17:02.521
stepping stone that he would
want to build up my confidence.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.825
{\an4}All right.

17:04.857 --> 17:06.825
Let's go have a drink.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.827
{\an4}Let's do.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.827
Well, just let me
have this one

17:08.894 --> 17:10.695

19:38.810 --> 19:39.845
Yes, she went to bed.

You can come here.

hold his liquor,
