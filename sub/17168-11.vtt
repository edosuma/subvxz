get some snacks

10:15.148 --> 10:17.082
That is a great story.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.150
(PLAYS MUSIC)

10:19.152 --> 10:22.020
(GROANS)
I've failed as a bard.

10:22.022 --> 10:24.122
My stories
didn't teach you anything.

10:24.124 --> 10:25.590
That's not true, Robin.

10:25.592 --> 10:27.559
Hansel and Gretel taught us
to eat proper meals.

10:27.561 --> 10:31.396
From the Rapunzel we learned
the value of independence.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.132
And Little Red Riding Hood
taught us to be responsible

10:34.134 --> 10:35.500
for our actions.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.736
But the most important thing
we learned...

10:37.738 --> 10:40.905
Is that you wear man diapers!

10:40.907 --> 10:43.141
(ALL CHEERING)

10:43.143 --> 10:44.409
BEAST BOY: Ha-ha!
