10:33.502 --> 10:35.591
for a drink and some trouble.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.462
Yeah, uh-huh.
Do you have a reservation?

10:37.506 --> 10:39.464
Oh. Uh, well, we don't...

10:39.508 --> 10:43.294
We're just a-a classic
roving gang.

10:43.338 --> 10:46.210
Look, I know you're Starfleet.
You're in full uniform.

10:46.254 --> 10:47.559
You can't just walk in because

10:47.603 --> 10:48.996
you think you're
better than everyone.

10:49.039 --> 10:51.128
Oh, no, I don't think that.

10:51.172 --> 10:52.608
Can you just put us on the list?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.697
Sure, but it's a two-hour wait.

10:54.741 --> 10:56.699
Seems pretty empty.

10:56.743 --> 10:58.135
[squeaks]

10:58.179 --> 10:59.702
We don't have two hours.

10:59.746 --> 11:01.138
Well, you could go
across the street

11:01.182 --> 11:03.445
to Zorkys,
but it's got way worse drinks.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.621
Plus the black market intel's
less reliable.

11:05.665 --> 11:08.276
Captain, we need a solid lead.

11:08.319 --> 11:10.582
Aah!

11:10.626 --> 11:12.497
You're good.

11:12.541 --> 11:14.064
Did he have a reservation?

11:14.108 --> 11:15.936
Bounty hunters
get priority seating.

11:15.979 --> 11:18.808
Well, what if he buys the same
information we're looking for?

11:18.852 --> 11:21.593
Oops. Looks like your wait
just went up by 30 minutes.

11:21.637 --> 11:23.944
-Ugh.
-Did this come up
in your seminar?

11:23.987 --> 11:25.597
No, it did not.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.121
Hey, come on in.

11:27.164 --> 11:29.689
Jippers are half price
for tripeds today.

11:32.474 --> 11:35.259
I've never seen a Romulan
look so strung out.

11:35.303 --> 11:36.696
It's got
to be that Bird-of-Prey.

11:36.739 --> 11:38.262
The Klingons
are up to something.

11:38.306 --> 11:39.742
Just like when they attacked us
with the Pakleds.

11:39.786 --> 11:42.049
-You were in that battle?
-Yeah, w-wait. Were you?

11:42.092 --> 11:43.572
-[exclaims]
-Aah!

11:43.615 --> 11:45.617
Die, Starfleet cur.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.706
[yells]

11:46.749 --> 11:49.099
[whimpers]

11:49.143 --> 11:50.971
We must find shelter
to avoid more attacks.

11:51.014 --> 11:53.277
-[whimpers]
-Ooh, I think
I found the perfect spot.

11:53.321 --> 11:54.801
Follow me.

11:54.844 --> 11:56.237
I could've handled
that Cardassian, you know.

11:56.280 --> 11:57.499
I have no doubt
you would have tried.

11:57.542 --> 12:00.110
[stammers, grunts]

12:08.553 --> 12:10.947
Ow! I got sticks in my boots.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.036
TENDI:
I don't like the look
of that storm.

12:13.080 --> 12:15.299
Sherbal V has all sorts
of strange... Wait.

12:15.343 --> 12:17.084
If we could find
the monitoring station

12:17.127 --> 12:18.999
that's linked to the buoy,
we can repurpose it

12:19.042 --> 12:20.652
into a distress beacon.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.002
There.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.700
BOIMLER:
Campfires.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.702
If we want to be safe, we should
go around the long way.

12:26.746 --> 12:28.617
I'm not afraid
of a little combat.

12:28.660 --> 12:30.967
I've seen Tendi swordfight, and
T'Lyn can clearly throw down.

12:31.011 --> 12:33.753
-We got this.
-Well, uh, actually, uh...

12:33.796 --> 12:36.494
The captain specifically ordered
us to keep you out of danger.

12:36.538 --> 12:38.148
What? Why?

12:38.192 --> 12:39.933
Mariner, come on.
You've been acting really weird.

12:39.976 --> 12:42.152
-No, I haven't.
-You have repeatedly
demonstrated

12:42.196 --> 12:44.154
a negligent attitude
towards your own well-being.

12:44.198 --> 12:46.113
-We're worried about you.
-What's wrong?

12:46.156 --> 12:48.158
Nothing's wrong. Sometimes
missions just get dangerous.

12:48.202 --> 12:50.030
What... You know, whatever.
Fine, we'll go the long way.

12:50.073 --> 12:51.814
-Mariner...
-Let's get some rest.

12:51.858 --> 12:54.686
We can tackle this tomorrow when
everyone's not being a dick.

13:07.395 --> 13:10.224
Mm. Teach me how to tap-dance,
Beverly Crusher.

13:20.625 --> 13:23.280
[grunting]

13:23.324 --> 13:26.109
This is my domain. Be gone.

13:26.153 --> 13:28.938
Oh, that's weird.
This doesn't look like Qo'noS.

13:28.982 --> 13:30.592
Maybe you're confused.

13:30.635 --> 13:31.941
I said go.

13:31.985 --> 13:33.595
Why don't you make me?

13:33.638 --> 13:35.858
I'm not intimidated
by some tore-up petaQ.

13:35.902 --> 13:37.729
[speaking Klingon]

13:37.773 --> 13:39.775
[both yelling and grunting]

13:58.663 --> 14:01.057
What are you waiting for?
Fight me, you coward.

14:01.101 --> 14:02.580
[grunts]

14:02.624 --> 14:03.843
Chay'?

14:05.975 --> 14:07.020
[gasps]

14:08.586 --> 14:09.936
Glass storm!

14:17.291 --> 14:19.859
[Mariner and Ma'ah panting]

14:22.426 --> 14:25.081
[sighs]
Stupid knife rain.

14:26.953 --> 14:28.606
This planet... [groans]

14:28.650 --> 14:31.348
has no honor. [grunts]

14:31.392 --> 14:33.960
Yeah?
Well, it was your Bird-of-Prey

14:34.003 --> 14:35.875
that forced us down here.

14:35.918 --> 14:39.617
You were attacked by cowards who
betrayed and abandoned me here.

14:39.661 --> 14:42.359
I will drive my d'k tahg
into their hearts!

14:42.403 --> 14:43.708
[sighs]

14:46.798 --> 14:48.322
Ugh. Let's just fight here.

14:48.365 --> 14:50.802
It is too confined
for proper combat.

14:50.846 --> 14:53.196
We will resume
when the storm passes.

14:53.240 --> 14:54.763
Ugh.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.650
You are Starfleet.

15:12.694 --> 15:14.696
Yeah.

15:14.739 --> 15:17.003
But you are also a warrior.

15:17.046 --> 15:19.266
[chuckles]
No, I'm not. I...

15:19.309 --> 15:21.790
My mind clears up when
something's trying to kill me.

15:21.833 --> 15:25.446
Mm. You wage war with yourself.

15:25.489 --> 15:27.317
You're real chatty
for a Klingon, you know that?

15:27.361 --> 15:28.884
[Ma'ah grumbles]

15:31.321 --> 15:33.280
[sighs]

15:33.323 --> 15:36.196
Well, I guess... one of us
will be dead soon anyway,

15:36.239 --> 15:38.459
so it doesn't really matter
what I say.

15:39.503 --> 15:42.376
Not too long ago,
I got a promotion I didn't want.

15:42.419 --> 15:45.161
I tried to get demoted,
but my commander won't do it.

15:45.205 --> 15:48.425
[chuckles]
You must hate Starfleet.

15:48.469 --> 15:49.861
[sighs]
That's the thing.

15:49.905 --> 15:51.863
I... don't.

15:51.907 --> 15:55.780
Back at the Academy,
my dream was to be a captain.

15:55.824 --> 15:58.958
I modeled myself
after this perfect friend.

16:00.002 --> 16:02.396
Sito was everything
I wanted to be.

16:02.439 --> 16:04.876
I mean, she made some mistakes,
but she rallied.

16:04.920 --> 16:06.617
She graduated ahead of me

16:06.661 --> 16:09.403
and was stationed
on the Enterprise.

16:09.446 --> 16:12.406
The Enterprise?I have heard
tales of its triumphs.

16:12.449 --> 16:14.451
Oh, yeah. So did she.

16:14.495 --> 16:17.193
And it got her murdered
by Cardassians.

16:18.151 --> 16:19.543
[sniffles]

16:19.587 --> 16:21.893
She didn't sign up to be a spy.

16:21.937 --> 16:24.984
She... she-she wanted
to explore. She...

16:25.985 --> 16:27.551
It destroyed me.

16:27.595 --> 16:29.945
[sniffles]
Then,

16:29.989 --> 16:32.339
before I knew it,
the Vorta, the Jem'Hadar...

16:32.382 --> 16:34.906
The Jem'Hadar?
You fought the Dominion?

16:34.950 --> 16:37.518
Ah. The shapeshifters
sent many warriors

16:37.561 --> 16:39.040
to Sto-vo-kor.

16:39.085 --> 16:41.652
-I wish I could have seen it.
-No, you do not.

16:41.696 --> 16:44.090
There was no honor,
just massacres.

16:44.133 --> 16:46.962
But in the end
you were victorious.

16:47.006 --> 16:48.790
Starfleet is supposed to be

16:48.833 --> 16:51.140
about puzzling together
the mysteries of life,

16:51.184 --> 16:52.794
not fighting wars.

16:52.837 --> 16:54.491
I don't want to be a general.

16:54.535 --> 16:57.494
I don't, I don't want
to send my friends off to die.

16:59.105 --> 17:01.542
I just want to be an ensign.

17:01.585 --> 17:03.544
If it was good enough for Sito,

17:03.587 --> 17:05.675
then it's good enough for me.

17:09.723 --> 17:12.465
In the past
Klingons believed humans

17:12.509 --> 17:14.685
to be weak and easily defeated.

17:14.729 --> 17:18.079
But your species has proved
its toDuj.

17:18.124 --> 17:19.733
Sito was a warrior.

17:19.777 --> 17:22.258
-You do not honor her.
-You didn't know her.

17:22.301 --> 17:24.434
Do you follow every order
from your commanders?

17:24.478 --> 17:27.481
-No.
-Sito made her choice.

17:27.523 --> 17:29.700
You want to solve puzzles
and mysteries?

17:29.744 --> 17:33.313
Your friend gave her life
to protect that. [scoffs]

17:33.356 --> 17:35.576
She would not approve
of your actions.

17:35.619 --> 17:37.578
You're...

17:37.621 --> 17:40.320
You're right.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.236
She'd... she'd say
I'm acting like an idiot.

17:43.279 --> 17:45.281
A biHnuch.

17:45.325 --> 17:47.196
Okay, but Starfleet
can do better.

17:47.240 --> 17:49.894
I'm not wrong to call out
bull[bleep] when I see it.

17:51.157 --> 17:54.595

17:54.638 --> 17:56.597

and study your--

17:59.382 --> 18:01.036
what is it-- plants?

18:01.080 --> 18:04.039
Yeah, I mean...
Yeah, sometimes it's plants.

-My name's Beckett.
-I am M'aah.

18:06.737 --> 18:09.871
The storm is over.
We can resume our battle.

18:09.914 --> 18:12.003
There is a clearing
over there that... [groans]

18:12.047 --> 18:13.831
Remove yourself.
What is the meaning of this?

18:13.875 --> 18:16.095
-I'm hugging you.
-K-Klingons do not hug.

18:16.138 --> 18:17.574
We're both trapped
on this planet,

-We should work together.
-Wait. Uh, no.

20:44.460 --> 20:47.811
If we approach from the north,
we can take out the Orion.

20:47.855 --> 20:49.639
She is not to be underestimated.

20:49.683 --> 20:52.294
The others will scatter.
They already fear me.

20:52.338 --> 20:54.340
No. We can't attack.
We have to do something harder.

20:54.383 --> 20:55.689
Wha...?

20:55.732 --> 20:58.213
-Aah!
-[whistles] Yo. Hello. Hey.

20:58.257 --> 21:00.868
Everybody stop.
I'm calling a time-out.

21:00.911 --> 21:02.348
Time-out?

21:02.391 --> 21:03.914
Starfleet trickery. Attack her!

21:03.958 --> 21:06.221
[grunts]
She will speak.

21:06.265 --> 21:07.962
-[others gasp, speak Bynar]
-MARINER: Look,

21:08.005 --> 21:10.312
I know we're all hungry
and pissed off to be stranded,

21:10.356 --> 21:12.140
but that's what they want.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.185
Does anybody know
who did this, by the way?

21:14.229 --> 21:16.623
-[groans]
-Someone fed lies
to my lower officers.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.494
They mutinied
and shut down our systems.

21:18.538 --> 21:20.888
[gasps] The same thing
happened on my ship.

21:20.931 --> 21:22.498
[speaking Bynar]

21:22.542 --> 21:25.414
Too true, man. Look,
I don't know who did this to us,

21:25.458 --> 21:27.329
but we aren't the enemies here.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.462
If we want to get off
this planet, we all have to

21:29.505 --> 21:32.508
stop fighting over resources
and work together.

21:32.552 --> 21:35.337
[chuckles] I refuse
to bend the knee to Starfleet.

21:35.381 --> 21:37.644
-You're worse than the Romulans.
-Hey.

21:37.687 --> 21:39.689
It will be an honor
to die with you.

21:39.733 --> 21:41.691
I'm not fighting.
No, there's been enough of that.

21:41.735 --> 21:44.477
Then accept my thanks
for making this easy.

21:44.520 --> 21:47.567
[grunts]
Captain Cosmia, stand down.

21:47.610 --> 21:50.526
[gasps] Mistress
of the Winter Constellations.

21:50.570 --> 21:52.093
This is my friend.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.313
Harming her is an attack
on my entire house.

21:54.356 --> 21:56.706
Uh, uh, of course.
We would never...

21:56.750 --> 21:58.708
Thanks, T.

21:58.752 --> 22:01.929
Look, we don't have
to like each other.

22:01.972 --> 22:03.931
But until we're
off this [bleep] planet,

22:03.974 --> 22:05.715
we need to work together.

22:05.759 --> 22:07.108
-[grunting]
-How else are you gonna
get revenge

22:07.151 --> 22:09.197
on whoever did this?

22:09.240 --> 22:11.721
Each and every one of you
comes from a species

22:11.765 --> 22:13.941
that chose to travel into space,

22:13.984 --> 22:16.378
and all the danger
that comes with it.

22:16.422 --> 22:18.511
We've survived worse.

22:18.554 --> 22:21.688
If we can work together,
nothing can stop us.

22:23.777 --> 22:26.736
Hmm. I know a good deal
when I hear it.

22:26.780 --> 22:28.347
[speaking Bynar]

22:28.390 --> 22:29.783
I'm not joining anything,

22:29.826 --> 22:33.047
but we will cease aggression.
For now.

22:33.090 --> 22:35.049
If we're all done trying
to prove how tough we are,

22:35.092 --> 22:37.617
that station can be updated
to a distress beacon.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.706
This planet is so remote,
it could take a while.

22:39.749 --> 22:42.230
Oh, they'll find us.
We are getting out of...

22:42.273 --> 22:43.797
-Aah!
-Mariner!

22:43.840 --> 22:46.060
-[speaking Bynar]
-What is she up to?

22:46.103 --> 22:47.931
She has been transported
off planet.

22:47.975 --> 22:50.151
-This is a trap.
-[clamoring]

22:50.194 --> 22:51.892
Enough!

22:51.935 --> 22:54.155
Beckett is honorable.
She would not betray us.

22:54.198 --> 22:56.462
Orion, finish your work.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.551
I have a plan.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.596
Sorry the mission
was a failure, Captain.

23:00.640 --> 23:02.990
Who knew a bunch of criminals
would hate Starfleet?

23:03.033 --> 23:05.427
I did, which is why
the mission was a success,

23:05.471 --> 23:06.907
as I knew it would be.

23:06.950 --> 23:09.431
It was? But we didn't
get the information.

23:09.475 --> 23:11.477
Oh, yes, we did.

23:12.521 --> 23:14.523
[garbled electronic speech]

23:16.133 --> 23:17.439
[laughing]:
Ooh. Wow.

23:17.483 --> 23:18.919
-What?!
-Billups?!

23:18.962 --> 23:20.399
Do you know
how sweaty and uncomfortable

23:20.442 --> 23:22.009
a full-face helmet gets?
[chuckles] Terrible.

23:22.052 --> 23:23.445
You totally tricked those guys.

23:23.489 --> 23:25.316
I knew walking in there,

23:25.360 --> 23:27.667
wearing our uniforms
would just make us targets,

23:27.710 --> 23:30.452
so I used their bias
against them.

23:30.496 --> 23:34.630
Now let's find Locarno
before it's too late.

23:37.067 --> 23:40.723
Ugh. There's a distress call
coming from the planet, Captain.

23:40.767 --> 23:42.290
Locate the source now!

23:45.554 --> 23:48.601
-The signal is coming
from that structure there.
-Destroy it!

23:48.644 --> 23:50.516
It's shielded
by those rock formations.

23:50.559 --> 23:52.431
I don't care.
Take us closer.

23:56.260 --> 23:59.655
-For the empire!
-[all shouting]

24:03.354 --> 24:06.183
Mr. Locarno.
Fan out.

24:07.489 --> 24:09.448
[grunting]

24:09.491 --> 24:12.059
-Captain, someone's on the hull.
-Get us back into orbit now.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.495
[grunting]

24:13.539 --> 24:15.541
It's too late!

24:15.584 --> 24:18.282
-Stay back. This is my ship.
-[grunting]

24:23.897 --> 24:27.335
No. It is my ship.

24:27.378 --> 24:28.728
Mariner's not here.

24:28.771 --> 24:30.817
Then... then where is she?

24:30.860 --> 24:34.516
Nick? Nick Locarno?
We're Starfleet.

24:34.560 --> 24:35.952
We need to take you
into protective...

24:35.996 --> 24:37.301
RUTHERFORD:
Captain.

24:38.433 --> 24:40.087
Oh, my God.

24:44.831 --> 24:46.659
[gasps]

24:46.702 --> 24:49.313
[panting]

24:49.357 --> 24:52.273
What in the minimalist hell
is...

24:55.798 --> 24:58.366
[grunting]

24:58.409 --> 25:01.282
[laughing]:
Whoa! Hey, relax.

25:01.325 --> 25:03.545
Nick? What the hell
are you doing here?

25:03.589 --> 25:06.635
We're gonna cause
some trouble together.
