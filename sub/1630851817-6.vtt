A NETFLIX SERIES

00:19.666 --> 00:21.416
<i>The sun shines on you, Alice.</i>

00:22.583 --> 00:24.333
<i>The day smells of new chances.</i>

00:27.333 --> 00:30.416
<i>There's work that makes you feel</i>
<i>like you own your life.</i>

00:37.125 --> 00:38.166
<i>A healthy life.</i>

00:41.291 --> 00:43.250
1. GET UP WITH THE RIGHT ATTITUDE
2. LIVE HEALTHY

00:45.208 --> 00:47.250
<i>The most important thing,</i>

00:47.333 --> 00:50.041
<i>when you dodge a bullet,</i>
<i>you learn a lesson.</i>

00:51.833 --> 00:54.333
<i>And you really dodged a bullet with Carlo.</i>

00:58.250 --> 01:00.375
<i>You could have been Cristina.</i>

01:02.041 --> 01:03.958
<i>Oh yes, you could have.</i>

01:11.458 --> 01:12.291
Alice!

01:14.333 --> 01:15.375
Alice, wait.

01:16.750 --> 01:17.750
Wait up!

01:21.041 --> 01:27.250
AN ASTROLOGICAL GUIDE FOR BROKEN HEARTS

01:27.500 --> 01:31.041
VIRGO

01:31.666 --> 01:33.375
<i>Damn it, the chain is stuck!</i>

01:38.750 --> 01:39.666
Listen to me.

01:39.750 --> 01:40.833
I don't want to.

01:41.958 --> 01:44.083
What you saw last night

01:44.166 --> 01:45.833
is not what you think.

01:45.916 --> 01:49.000
This is exactly the bullshit
I don't want to hear.

01:49.083 --> 01:51.333
Come on! What I mean is…

01:51.416 --> 01:54.291
Sonia means nothing to me!

01:54.791 --> 01:55.791
Seriously.

01:56.541 --> 01:58.541
Please, stop.

01:58.625 --> 02:00.208
Hear me out.

02:02.750 --> 02:03.916
She's just one

02:04.958 --> 02:05.791
of my students.

02:06.916 --> 02:10.791
She kept looking at me
during the History of Cinema lecture.

02:10.875 --> 02:12.500
Well, you're the teacher.

02:12.583 --> 02:13.791
I was.

02:13.875 --> 02:15.458
What do you mean?

02:15.541 --> 02:18.458
A girl looks at you,
she waits for you after class

02:18.541 --> 02:21.666
and you forget that you're engaged
to your pregnant girlfriend?

02:23.875 --> 02:26.791
I ended it yesterday. Hold on.

02:27.375 --> 02:30.250
Had you not been so busy at work,

02:31.166 --> 02:32.833
maybe I would have told you.

02:32.916 --> 02:35.041
-And it wouldn't have happened.
-What?

02:35.958 --> 02:37.625
Are you saying it's my fault?

02:37.708 --> 02:39.708
No.

02:39.791 --> 02:42.458
I don't want to get involved in this.

02:43.458 --> 02:44.375
Fuck off!

02:57.458 --> 02:58.291
Coming.

02:59.833 --> 03:00.708
Coming.

03:02.958 --> 03:04.291
Coming.

03:05.500 --> 03:06.583
Alice, hi.

03:07.250 --> 03:08.458
What are you doing here?

03:08.541 --> 03:09.500
Well…

03:10.625 --> 03:12.333
you don't reply to my texts

03:12.833 --> 03:13.833
or my calls.

03:13.916 --> 03:15.333
Come on in.

03:15.416 --> 03:17.958
What texts? What calls?

03:19.458 --> 03:22.208
You've been calling my old work phone.

03:23.416 --> 03:26.166
I gave it back to Sardi when I left.

03:26.250 --> 03:27.375
<i>Oh shit.</i>

03:29.500 --> 03:31.291
Why, what did your messages say?

03:31.375 --> 03:33.833
That I was sorry and…

03:33.916 --> 03:36.791
that I felt guilty
because Sardi fired you.

03:37.708 --> 03:39.083
Because of the show.

03:39.166 --> 03:41.458
Sardi didn't fire me, I quit.

03:41.541 --> 03:42.375
What?

03:42.458 --> 03:43.625
Yes, I…

03:44.708 --> 03:46.416
Staying didn't make sense.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.458
I needed to sort stuff out.

03:49.958 --> 03:51.500
I don't mean it literally.

03:51.583 --> 03:52.666
You see…

03:52.750 --> 03:55.000
Riccardo is at Elvira's this week.

03:55.083 --> 03:55.916
So…

04:03.875 --> 04:05.083
You know what?

04:05.166 --> 04:08.333
Since you got me fired,
now you can help me tidy up.

04:16.500 --> 04:18.166
Are things over with Elvira?

04:23.583 --> 04:24.625
I'm so sorry.

04:31.541 --> 04:32.375
Okay.

04:33.041 --> 04:34.125
You wash, I dry.

04:35.208 --> 04:36.875
It sounds like a plan.

04:39.208 --> 04:40.916
For the record, Sardi found me

04:41.000 --> 04:43.083
a part-time job at a radio station.

04:55.250 --> 04:58.000
3. SPEAK TO ENRICO

05:01.208 --> 05:05.166
4. APOLOGIZE TO DAVIDE

05:13.791 --> 05:20.458
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM OF CINEMA TURIN

05:56.375 --> 05:57.250
Alice?

05:57.750 --> 05:58.750
-Yes.
-Hi.

05:58.833 --> 05:59.916
Hi.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.500
Starting from urgent matters,

06:01.583 --> 06:03.916
Carlo has asked for you three times.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.583
-Next?
-Give it here.

06:06.458 --> 06:08.208
Tio has been a bit odd.

06:08.291 --> 06:10.291
Tio is always odd. Next?

06:10.375 --> 06:11.541
It's Marlin.

06:11.625 --> 06:15.125
She wants to dress up like
Audrey Hepburn in <i>Roman Holiday</i>.

06:16.291 --> 06:18.541
And we need to check the video.

06:18.625 --> 06:20.333
Tell Marlin I'll be right there.

06:20.416 --> 06:21.875
And what about Carlo?

06:23.125 --> 06:24.000
He can wait.

06:25.875 --> 06:26.708
Bye.

06:36.041 --> 06:37.375
-Morning.
-Morning.

06:44.166 --> 06:46.166
Davide. I owe you an apology.

06:47.583 --> 06:48.500
Do you?

06:49.208 --> 06:50.375
Yes.

06:50.458 --> 06:52.708
I thought you'd fired Enrico,

06:52.791 --> 06:55.083
but now I know that you didn't.

06:55.666 --> 06:57.500
Actually, you helped him out.

06:58.291 --> 06:59.291
So…

06:59.375 --> 07:03.000
Is this why you've been treating me
like I had the plague?

07:04.708 --> 07:05.791
I'm so sorry.

07:09.875 --> 07:10.875
Apology accepted.

07:13.500 --> 07:14.750
Speaking of Enrico,

07:15.833 --> 07:17.500
do you have his work phone?

07:18.208 --> 07:19.041
Yes.

07:19.125 --> 07:20.166
Have you used it?

07:20.750 --> 07:22.041
-No.
-Good.

07:22.625 --> 07:23.791
No, you know…

07:23.875 --> 07:24.791
I mean,

07:24.875 --> 07:27.375
it's already so stressful
having one phone,

07:27.458 --> 07:28.708
two would be madness.

07:30.583 --> 07:32.333
Could I have it, maybe?

07:33.000 --> 07:34.541
Mine has been misbehaving.

07:36.750 --> 07:37.666
No problem.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.250
I'll look for it.

07:39.333 --> 07:40.166
Of course.

07:40.791 --> 07:42.333
-Whenever you can.
-Alice?

07:42.416 --> 07:43.250
Yes?

07:43.333 --> 07:45.208
Marlin is dressed now.

07:48.208 --> 07:49.333
Coming.

08:02.416 --> 08:04.041
I love it.

08:04.125 --> 08:05.541
The colors are great.

08:06.041 --> 08:07.500
We'll talk later.

08:07.583 --> 08:08.708
Great idea, thanks.

08:09.541 --> 08:11.375
Let's try it out.

08:11.458 --> 08:12.541
Mara, remember,

08:12.625 --> 08:14.458
frame everyone this way.

08:14.541 --> 08:17.333
Could you ask him
to do something together?

08:17.416 --> 08:18.291
Kind of like a game.

08:18.375 --> 08:19.208
Good morning.

08:19.291 --> 08:21.291
Thanks for the opportunity.

08:26.875 --> 08:27.958
Hi.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.291
Can we talk?

08:29.791 --> 08:32.166
Cristina, sorry, I am really busy and--

08:32.250 --> 08:33.375
Please, one minute.

08:44.041 --> 08:45.666
I know that we're not…

08:47.166 --> 08:49.083
That things haven't been…

08:51.041 --> 08:51.916
Okay.

08:52.666 --> 08:54.208
I want to apologize.

08:55.458 --> 08:58.958
The truth is, I've always envied
your friendship with Carlo.

09:00.791 --> 09:02.958
There's nothing between me and Carlo.

09:04.333 --> 09:05.750
He tells you everything.

09:08.166 --> 09:10.166
Has he mentioned if…

09:12.208 --> 09:13.875
he still wants to marry me?

09:15.250 --> 09:17.041
If he's happy about the baby?

09:19.041 --> 09:21.666
He's been acting strangely lately.

09:22.541 --> 09:23.833
Has he said anything?

09:26.208 --> 09:28.541
I know you're his friend, not mine.

09:29.208 --> 09:30.041
But I thought…

09:36.083 --> 09:37.208
Well, maybe…

09:37.833 --> 09:39.375
he seems strange because…

09:40.583 --> 09:42.333
the wedding is coming up.

09:43.416 --> 09:44.958
Maybe he feels…

09:46.833 --> 09:47.833
nervous?

09:49.375 --> 09:50.375
Maybe.

09:54.291 --> 09:55.125
Thanks anyway.

09:57.791 --> 09:58.666
<i>Tell her!</i>

10:02.458 --> 10:04.083
<i>Run after her and tell her.</i>

10:07.375 --> 10:08.291
Alice.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.500
We'll talk as soon as I can.

10:10.583 --> 10:11.750
Of course.

10:11.833 --> 10:13.000
-Good morning.
-Hi.

10:14.041 --> 10:15.625
-Hi.
-This is good.

10:15.708 --> 10:18.125
-I have a half hour. Care to join me?
-Yes.

10:18.208 --> 10:20.041
-Is everything okay?
-Yes.

10:20.125 --> 10:22.333
We've barely seen each other lately.

10:25.625 --> 10:26.500
Hi.

10:27.250 --> 10:28.375
-Hi.
-Hi.

10:29.500 --> 10:32.416
I'm glad you're here, can we talk?

10:32.500 --> 10:34.958
You can take a break.
We need to review the video.

10:35.041 --> 10:38.833
The video is my responsibility.

10:38.916 --> 10:41.916
Are we really talking
about your responsibilities?

10:47.083 --> 10:47.916
Okay.

10:48.000 --> 10:48.875
No, fine.

10:49.458 --> 10:50.291
Okay.

10:51.375 --> 10:53.583
Maybe, we can talk about it later.

10:53.666 --> 10:55.041
I did want to know…

10:55.875 --> 10:56.791
Bye.

10:56.875 --> 10:58.125
-Bye.
-Bye.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.541
You're mean.

11:02.625 --> 11:05.250
He put me in a difficult situation.

11:05.833 --> 11:08.375
I can't look Cristina in the eye.

11:09.291 --> 11:12.000
Do you think he's serious about the girl?

11:12.083 --> 11:12.916
I don't know.

11:13.416 --> 11:14.583
And I don't care.

11:18.541 --> 11:19.958
What are you watching?

11:21.291 --> 11:22.541
It looks like…

11:25.541 --> 11:26.416
I don't know.

11:26.500 --> 11:28.416
If you didn't know us…

11:29.875 --> 11:31.625
what would you think of Davide and me?

11:33.208 --> 11:34.208
No, I mean,

11:34.291 --> 11:36.875
if you didn't know we're just colleagues.

11:42.500 --> 11:45.041
Are you telling me you fancy Davide Sardi?

11:53.041 --> 11:53.875
Yes.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.375
Is everything okay?

11:58.875 --> 11:59.708
Yes.

12:00.916 --> 12:03.291
Mara's right. You're particularly odd.

12:04.375 --> 12:05.625
Is your gran alright?

12:06.833 --> 12:07.791
Yes, she's…

12:08.458 --> 12:09.583
She's fine.

12:11.250 --> 12:12.541
It's me.

12:15.041 --> 12:18.083
How can I put it? I'm questioning my

12:19.000 --> 12:21.625
credibility as a love consultant, you see.

12:21.708 --> 12:22.833
That's it.

12:23.458 --> 12:24.541
What do you mean?

12:25.583 --> 12:27.291
In the sense that…

12:29.625 --> 12:31.000
What if I were wrong?

12:31.541 --> 12:35.208
Maybe I'm going around spouting bullshit.

12:36.750 --> 12:39.625
Maybe I'm just scared
of falling in love, like you said.

12:41.791 --> 12:43.916
-What?
-Sorry, Alice.

12:44.000 --> 12:47.125
Carlo sent me
to help you out with the video.

12:47.708 --> 12:48.833
May I?

12:48.916 --> 12:50.166
Of course, Olmo.

12:50.250 --> 12:51.208
Sit down.

12:51.791 --> 12:52.625
Come.

12:52.708 --> 12:53.625
Thank you.

12:53.708 --> 12:56.625
Can you wait for me?
We can continue our chat later.

12:57.791 --> 12:59.375
Don't you worry.

13:00.000 --> 13:01.666
I'm just feeling a little off.

13:02.541 --> 13:03.375
Bye.

13:08.375 --> 13:09.541
Come on, Olmo!

13:24.500 --> 13:26.708
<i>I know you're mad at me, Enrico.</i>

13:26.791 --> 13:30.041
<i>I had nothing to do with Sardi's decision.</i>

13:30.125 --> 13:31.416
<i>Please believe me.</i>

13:32.041 --> 13:34.250
<i>He was a coward to fire you like that.</i>

13:34.833 --> 13:36.458
<i>Davide Sardi.</i>

13:36.541 --> 13:39.500
<i>I'd love to tell him</i>
<i>how much of an asshole he is.</i>

13:40.333 --> 13:42.416
<i>I had a dream about him.</i>

13:42.500 --> 13:45.500
<i>He was smiling at me and I headbutted him.</i>

13:46.708 --> 13:48.041
<i>He's so arrogant.</i>

13:49.791 --> 13:52.708
<i>Yes, he's handsome</i>
<i>but I bet he had his nose done.</i>

13:55.625 --> 13:58.625
<i>Have I told you about that time</i>
<i>I threw up on him?</i>

13:59.708 --> 14:02.375
<i>Thinking about it now is very satisfying.</i>

14:15.458 --> 14:16.333
<i>Hello?</i>

14:16.416 --> 14:19.166
-I have an hour for lunch. Can you come?
-<i>Sure.</i>

14:19.250 --> 14:21.000
-Well?
-This morning I was so happy.

14:21.083 --> 14:23.208
My to-do list seemed to be working.

14:23.291 --> 14:25.375
And now I'm in an even bigger mess.

14:25.458 --> 14:26.375
Why?

14:29.916 --> 14:30.875
I like Davide.

14:32.791 --> 14:34.041
There, I said it.

14:34.125 --> 14:35.583
-Davide Sardi?
-Yes.

14:38.041 --> 14:40.458
It's not a good idea, he's your boss.

14:40.541 --> 14:44.666
It's not the right time to mess things up
as your career is taking off.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.125
Alright, but…

14:46.208 --> 14:48.875
Giovanni was your boss too,
when you two met.

14:48.958 --> 14:51.416
Sure, but it was a tiny,
insignificant detail.

14:52.041 --> 14:52.916
You're right.

14:55.625 --> 14:57.916
Your advice is on point today.

14:58.000 --> 14:59.375
It always is.

15:00.041 --> 15:02.750
But you often choose my competitor.

15:02.833 --> 15:04.416
-Are you jealous?
-No.

15:04.500 --> 15:06.458
I assume Tio wasn't around today.

15:06.541 --> 15:07.833
Are you crazy?

15:09.166 --> 15:11.000
You're my best friend.

15:12.208 --> 15:13.041
Anyway,

15:13.625 --> 15:15.083
Tio's been unreliable.

15:15.666 --> 15:17.625
He's been acting strange.

15:17.708 --> 15:19.791
His mind is somewhere else.

15:20.666 --> 15:24.708
Or maybe he has a crush on someone
and he has his head in the clouds.

15:25.291 --> 15:27.041
Or shall we say in the stars?

15:27.125 --> 15:29.291
Tio? A crush?

15:29.375 --> 15:30.833
On whom?

15:34.708 --> 15:35.541
No.

15:36.375 --> 15:37.208
-No.
-Yes.

15:37.291 --> 15:39.875
-No.
-Think about it.

15:39.958 --> 15:42.125
First, according to the stars

15:42.208 --> 15:44.500
the men you're dating
are never good enough.

15:44.583 --> 15:47.208
Then he acts all jealous
at your parents' party

15:47.291 --> 15:49.250
when you're pining for Alejandro.

15:49.333 --> 15:52.625
He's always so attentive,
full of little gestures…

15:54.583 --> 15:56.541
He's like a brother to me.

15:56.625 --> 15:57.458
He's not.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.750
Actually,

15:59.833 --> 16:00.750
he's cute.

16:00.833 --> 16:02.083
And he's not your boss.

16:05.333 --> 16:06.583
Is my sandwich ready?

16:06.666 --> 16:07.791
Sorry, it's coming.

16:07.875 --> 16:09.708
-Eat this.
-I lost my appetite.

16:11.166 --> 16:13.375
-Bye, Alice. See you tomorrow.
-Thanks, guys.

16:15.208 --> 16:16.250
I'm going home.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.833
It's all ready.
We'll be here tomorrow at 9:00 a.m.

16:18.916 --> 16:20.375
Okay, thank you.

16:22.125 --> 16:23.583
Is Tio still around?

16:24.958 --> 16:25.958
Over there.

16:27.375 --> 16:28.333
Who's the blond?

16:28.416 --> 16:30.083
She sorted out the permits.

16:34.208 --> 16:35.833
Sardi keeps looking for you.

16:37.500 --> 16:38.333
Alice?

16:39.125 --> 16:39.958
Bye.

16:40.500 --> 16:41.375
Thanks, Mara.

16:41.458 --> 16:42.291
Bye.

16:50.750 --> 16:51.958
I have the phone.

17:02.250 --> 17:03.083
It's yours.

17:06.666 --> 17:08.291
You listened to the messages.

17:12.750 --> 17:14.000
I couldn't help myself.

17:14.583 --> 17:16.208
It was fun.

17:16.958 --> 17:17.791
Really?

17:19.041 --> 17:20.000
Sure.

17:21.541 --> 17:24.041
How did it go with our Audrey Hepburn?

17:25.083 --> 17:27.166
Is she alright being just herself?

17:27.250 --> 17:28.375
Apparently, yes.

17:29.166 --> 17:31.458
Tio wouldn't be a great Gregory Peck.

17:33.750 --> 17:37.041
I read somewhere that
during the shoot for <i>Roman Holiday</i>

17:37.125 --> 17:39.333
he couldn't start the Vespa.

17:42.916 --> 17:43.958
If only people knew

17:44.041 --> 17:47.208
how complicated
romantic scenes are to film…

17:50.333 --> 17:51.916
They wouldn't want to know.

18:58.833 --> 19:00.083
We should talk.

19:00.666 --> 19:02.625
Absolutely. As you can see…

19:03.708 --> 19:04.541
Not here.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.083
Wait.

19:22.541 --> 19:23.833
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

19:36.125 --> 19:38.333
<i>What has Carlo told her?</i>

19:38.416 --> 19:39.750
Wait a minute.

19:42.125 --> 19:42.958
Hi.

19:43.458 --> 19:45.208
<i>I need help!</i>

19:45.291 --> 19:46.458
What happened?

19:47.125 --> 19:48.708
<i>-I'm useless!</i>
-Where are you?

19:48.791 --> 19:49.625
<i>In the bathroom.</i>

19:49.708 --> 19:50.666
<i>Are you still here?</i>

19:50.750 --> 19:52.666
-Yes.
<i>-I don't know what to do.</i>

19:53.250 --> 19:54.208
Okay, I'm coming.

19:55.166 --> 19:56.375
-One moment.
<i>-Thanks.</i>

19:59.291 --> 20:00.291
Is everything okay?

20:10.291 --> 20:11.500
Give me five minutes.

20:11.583 --> 20:12.458
I'll be back.

20:35.708 --> 20:36.833
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

20:36.916 --> 20:38.041
<i>Don't run away.</i>

20:39.416 --> 20:41.333
It's all in the contrast…

20:41.416 --> 20:42.500
Ms. Bassi.

20:44.916 --> 20:46.458
I thought you'd gone.

20:47.541 --> 20:49.875
Let me introduce you
to the woman who allowed us

20:49.958 --> 20:52.666
to put your genius idea into practice.

20:52.750 --> 20:56.291
Mrs. Barbara Buchneim-Wessler
Ricci Pastori.

20:56.375 --> 20:57.666
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

20:57.750 --> 20:59.291
She's Alice Bassi,

20:59.375 --> 21:01.208
the show's creator.

21:03.083 --> 21:04.333
So you're the famous Alice.

21:04.416 --> 21:05.583
In the flesh.

21:06.208 --> 21:09.000
But the only thing I'm famous for
is my inability

21:09.083 --> 21:10.333
to take helmets off.

21:12.875 --> 21:13.833
Nice helmet.

21:14.416 --> 21:16.583
It got attached.

21:16.666 --> 21:17.666
May I?

21:17.750 --> 21:18.958
I must warn you…

21:19.916 --> 21:21.250
-Done.
-Oh.

21:22.291 --> 21:23.250
Thank you.

21:23.916 --> 21:25.625
I was just telling Barbara

21:25.708 --> 21:30.333
that this week's contestant
is of the sign of Virgo.

21:30.416 --> 21:31.458
Just like yourself.

21:33.416 --> 21:35.791
If your love interest is a Virgo,

21:35.875 --> 21:37.291
trust me on this.

21:38.166 --> 21:40.166
You could be in big trouble.

21:40.250 --> 21:41.500
Have you seen…

21:42.125 --> 21:43.291
<i>Psycho?</i>

21:43.375 --> 21:48.375
Maybe you've read one of those books
when the murderer is someone

21:48.458 --> 21:49.583
with a steady routine,

21:49.666 --> 21:51.666
apparently meek

21:51.750 --> 21:53.250
and balanced.

21:53.333 --> 21:55.333
Then the neighbors say,

21:56.250 --> 21:58.500
"He seemed to be such a nice guy."

21:58.583 --> 22:01.958
This is someone who loves

22:02.625 --> 22:04.500
doing the same thing

22:05.541 --> 22:06.875
day after day,

22:07.708 --> 22:09.458
hour after hour.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.708
Does he remind you of someone now?

22:17.708 --> 22:20.208
You could see this coincidence

22:20.291 --> 22:22.708
as a way of thanking you and the Museum

22:22.791 --> 22:24.000
for your generosity.

22:24.625 --> 22:25.833
Davide.

22:25.916 --> 22:27.541
He never asks me for anything.

22:27.625 --> 22:29.458
For once I can help him out.

22:29.541 --> 22:30.791
It's been a pleasure.

22:33.166 --> 22:35.250
I won't keep you.

22:35.333 --> 22:36.916
I'm sure you're very busy.

22:39.541 --> 22:40.750
Yes, of course.

22:40.833 --> 22:41.666
I am.

22:42.666 --> 22:44.458
Alright. If you'll excuse me.

22:44.541 --> 22:45.375
Of course.

22:50.083 --> 22:51.000
Cristina?

22:51.541 --> 22:53.250
I'm right here.

22:54.291 --> 22:55.541
God, what's wrong?

22:56.083 --> 22:58.083
I didn't know who to call.

22:58.166 --> 23:01.250
Okay. Do you need an ambulance?
Should I call someone?

23:01.333 --> 23:04.000
Carlo is seeing another woman,
I just know it.

23:07.000 --> 23:08.125
Don't say that.

23:10.083 --> 23:12.791
His phone has been off for hours.

23:13.375 --> 23:14.375
Well…

23:15.083 --> 23:17.958
There could be a multitude of reasons.

23:18.041 --> 23:18.875
No.

23:18.958 --> 23:20.458
There is only one.

23:21.625 --> 23:24.750
He was in the control room.
Maybe there's no reception.

23:27.791 --> 23:28.791
Okay.

23:29.375 --> 23:30.291
Now listen.

23:31.375 --> 23:32.208
I'm gonna go.

23:32.875 --> 23:34.791
-Get you a soda.
-Okay.

23:34.875 --> 23:36.291
It'll perk you up.

23:37.333 --> 23:38.541
Then you'll wash up.

23:39.250 --> 23:42.000
Put on that lipstick
I've always been jealous of.

23:43.333 --> 23:44.166
Calm down.

23:45.791 --> 23:47.958
We call a taxi and you go home.

23:49.833 --> 23:50.666
Wait here.

23:52.125 --> 23:53.125
I'll be right back.

24:09.208 --> 24:10.083
Alice?

24:10.666 --> 24:11.500
Alice?

24:12.541 --> 24:13.416
Where's Cristina?

24:13.500 --> 24:16.083
She called you a million times, you idiot!

24:16.166 --> 24:17.291
Is the baby okay?

24:19.250 --> 24:20.083
I was working.

24:20.166 --> 24:22.500
I didn't notice my battery was dead.

24:22.583 --> 24:24.375
Don't look at me like that!

24:24.458 --> 24:25.708
Don't you believe me?

24:27.083 --> 24:28.875
What I believe doesn't matter.

24:29.458 --> 24:31.333
Your fiancée is in there.

24:32.291 --> 24:35.750
The mother of your unborn child
thinks you're cheating on her.

24:40.750 --> 24:41.958
What did you tell her?

24:44.208 --> 24:46.458
That you'd never do such a thing to her.

24:50.708 --> 24:52.458
Don't make me regret it.

24:57.208 --> 24:58.041
Go.

24:59.666 --> 25:00.500
Go!

25:03.750 --> 25:04.583
Thank you.

25:32.750 --> 25:33.583
Hey.

25:34.083 --> 25:35.000
Hi.

25:35.083 --> 25:36.666
What are you doing all alone?

25:37.458 --> 25:39.000
Nothing, I was waiting

25:39.625 --> 25:41.833
for… a friend.

25:45.458 --> 25:48.000
Listen, I've been thinking…

25:49.916 --> 25:51.791
about our chat, earlier.

25:52.875 --> 25:53.750
And…

25:54.416 --> 25:56.666
I think I've been a bit selfish.

25:58.458 --> 25:59.375
Selfish?

26:00.416 --> 26:02.083
You have a crush, don't you?

26:05.875 --> 26:07.125
See, I knew it!

26:07.208 --> 26:08.625
That's why I feel bad.

26:08.708 --> 26:11.166
I could have done something,

26:11.250 --> 26:13.041
I should have noticed.

26:13.125 --> 26:14.000
Hey.

26:14.083 --> 26:16.416
-It was insensitive of me. Sorry.
-Hey.

26:21.166 --> 26:22.041
I'm sorry.

26:25.291 --> 26:26.666
-What?
-No, it's…

26:27.250 --> 26:29.250
I don't want to make things worse.

26:31.666 --> 26:33.250
How do you mean?

26:33.333 --> 26:34.583
Tio, I…

26:35.250 --> 26:37.666
I really love you,

26:38.250 --> 26:39.666
but not in that way.

26:47.083 --> 26:48.375
No, sorry.

26:50.083 --> 26:51.083
Are you crazy?

26:51.166 --> 26:53.125
You told me you were in love!

26:53.208 --> 26:54.875
Yes, sure.

26:55.541 --> 26:56.583
I don't know.

26:56.666 --> 26:57.791
Maybe.

26:57.875 --> 26:59.291
But not with you.

27:07.500 --> 27:08.750
The geologist?

27:09.291 --> 27:11.041
Why didn't you say?

27:11.125 --> 27:12.250
I was embarrassed.

27:12.333 --> 27:14.875
You kept saying how boring he was.

27:14.958 --> 27:16.666
And it's a new thing for me.

27:17.750 --> 27:19.416
It was love at first sight.

27:19.500 --> 27:21.000
Like in the movies.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.583
See, it can happen.

27:25.583 --> 27:27.750
I'm sailing in uncharted waters, Alice.

27:29.291 --> 27:30.125
But…

27:31.458 --> 27:32.375
I like him.

27:33.833 --> 27:35.208
I really like him.

27:35.291 --> 27:36.250
Maybe…

27:38.333 --> 27:41.041
I've never liked anybody like that before.

27:48.333 --> 27:50.166
Sail away, my friend.

27:51.958 --> 27:54.041
In this sea, there are no sharks,

27:54.625 --> 27:56.541
only a cute man

27:58.291 --> 27:59.125
who's kind…

28:01.250 --> 28:02.833
and wants to be with you.

28:12.125 --> 28:12.958
-Bye.
-Bye.

28:20.958 --> 28:22.000
Let's go.

28:24.083 --> 28:25.041
<i>Davide</i>.

28:26.291 --> 28:27.291
<i>I'm coming.</i>
