as a flight attendant.

19:12.285 --> 19:15.186
Well, I guess we need to embrace
the kid we have.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.255
Like you said,
whatever he wants to do,

19:17.257 --> 19:18.523
we'll support him.

19:18.525 --> 19:20.491
Absolutely.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.694
Space camp?

19:23.696 --> 19:25.463
Astronauts
are like flight attendants,

19:25.465 --> 19:26.831
but for science.

19:26.833 --> 19:30.835
Travel, snacks, helping others.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.436
It checks all the boxes.

19:32.438 --> 19:34.138
What are you doing?

19:34.140 --> 19:35.506
Embracing the kid we have.

19:35.508 --> 19:37.008
If he's gonna be
a flight attendant,

19:37.010 --> 19:39.143
he's gonna be the best kind.

19:39.145 --> 19:41.812
I'm gonna float
down the aisle of the spaceship

19:41.814 --> 19:45.783
and say, "Trash?"

19:45.785 --> 19:50.321
Trash? Trash?"

19:50.323 --> 19:52.156
Hey.

19:52.158 --> 19:54.992
I was thinking about what you
said about needing that energy.

19:54.994 --> 19:56.194
Here.

19:58.565 --> 20:00.965
"Dum Dum's Guide
to Becoming a Stockbroker"?

20:00.967 --> 20:03.501
I read an article in<i> Vibe</i>
magazine about Russell Simmons.

20:03.503 --> 20:05.536
The stock market is his jam.

20:05.538 --> 20:07.004
He says, if you're gonna gamble,

20:07.006 --> 20:09.340
gamble with
other people's money.

20:09.342 --> 20:11.709
Thanks. I'll check it out.

20:11.711 --> 20:13.711
I'm sorry about before.

20:13.713 --> 20:15.546
You don't really have
a butt face.

20:15.548 --> 20:17.315
Cool.

20:17.317 --> 20:19.383
Hey, I'm not training
for tennis anymore,

20:19.385 --> 20:20.985
so we can switch back bedrooms.

20:20.987 --> 20:22.253
Know what?

20:22.255 --> 20:24.188
I want to crash with Evan
for one more night.

20:24.190 --> 20:25.756
Just two G's in a bunk bed.

20:25.758 --> 20:27.992
Eddie, rule number 1!

20:27.994 --> 20:31.295
¶¶

20:38.504 --> 20:40.271
MAN: Nice to see you.

20:43.676 --> 20:45.009
Where's Emery?

20:45.011 --> 20:46.811
Please sit, Billie Jean King.

20:50.383 --> 20:52.416
I think we can all agree

20:52.418 --> 20:53.918
that we want what's best
for Emery.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.219
Are you firing me?

20:55.221 --> 20:56.420
Yes.

20:56.422 --> 20:57.722
And you were doing this
for free,

20:57.724 --> 20:59.323
so it must be
especially painful.

21:01.127 --> 21:02.827
Okay.

21:08.101 --> 21:09.900
[ Racket thuds ]
Hey, what the heck?!

21:09.902 --> 21:11.836
[ Grunting ]

21:18.278 --> 21:19.477
[ Sighs ]

21:19.479 --> 21:21.879
Find yourself, Billie Jean.

21:25.918 --> 21:27.985
So, is Pete Sampras nice?

21:27.987 --> 21:29.620
No, you know what?
I don't want to know.

21:29.622 --> 21:31.188
[ Chuckling ]
I don't want to know.
