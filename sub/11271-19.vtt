COACH BURIES A GRUDGE

00:08.844 --> 00:12.304
- Hey, everybody.
- How are you doing?

00:15.891 --> 00:20.937
- Surprise, surprise.
- Looky there. What's the occasion?

00:21.104 --> 00:26.484
Just a little peace offering.
I'm trying to make up for last night.

00:26.651 --> 00:29.361
You should feeI bad about that.

00:29.528 --> 00:34.241
No guy likes to be laughed at
at that particular moment.

00:35.950 --> 00:39.746
I couldn't help it.
You had that look on your face

00:39.913 --> 00:43.875
and for just a second,
you looked like a flounder.

00:45.126 --> 00:48.545
- Maybe it was the light.
- Apology accepted.

00:48.753 --> 00:52.174
But this better be a damn good gift,
I'll tell you that.

00:52.340 --> 00:56.595
I'll be darned. It's a sweater?

00:56.761 --> 01:00.015
An Icelandic snowflake
rag wooI sweater.

01:00.182 --> 01:03.100
I saw it in a catalogue. I had to get it.

01:03.267 --> 01:07.854
- Thank you. I love it. It's great.
- Put it on right now.

01:08.021 --> 01:14.027
I like to live with a piece of clothing
for a little while before I wear it.

01:14.194 --> 01:18.823
Come on. I know it's unusuaI.
It looks different when it's on.

01:18.990 --> 01:20.949
One person laughs...

01:21.116 --> 01:26.456
He will be exhibiting his own insecurity
and lack of taste.

01:26.623 --> 01:28.832
I just hate looking silly.

01:30.334 --> 01:34.170
Sam is about to modeI
his new sweater for us.

01:34.337 --> 01:39.883
- Look, Cliffie, goose bumps.
- Nothing in my horoscope about that.

01:41.093 --> 01:45.514
- Does it fit all right?
- It fits OK. Come in and take a look.

01:45.681 --> 01:50.101
You come out and show everyone
what a fashion plate you are.

01:50.268 --> 01:53.687
Believe me, not so much as a smirk.

01:55.000 --> 02:01.074

02:06.032 --> 02:09.369
I never saw a flounder
in a sweater before.

03:29.191 --> 03:31.819
Sam, the TV's on the blink again.

03:31.986 --> 03:36.614
- Where's Carla?
- Carla, get out here! TV's on the fritz.

03:38.825 --> 03:40.869
Work or die.

03:45.915 --> 03:50.752
- I have a way with inanimate objects.
- Take a crack at Norm.

03:53.130 --> 03:55.756
- What do you mean?
- What do I mean?

03:55.923 --> 04:03.055
Sitting like a lump. You lost your zest
for life, playing motorboat in your beer.

04:03.222 --> 04:07.517
I'm OK. It's just not the same
since Vera's been out of town.

04:07.684 --> 04:09.519
I miss having her around.

04:09.686 --> 04:13.440
- Where is she?
- She went to visit her parents.

04:13.607 --> 04:18.612
She's out there for a week in...
Where the heck do they live?

04:18.778 --> 04:22.364
One of those rectangular states.

04:26.577 --> 04:28.828
Why didn't you go with her?

04:28.995 --> 04:34.125
Her parents aren't happy I'm out of work.
They think I don't try.

04:34.292 --> 04:40.422
They got this crackpot idea that if I look
every day, make phone calls all the time,

04:40.589 --> 04:44.009
somehow, by magic,
a job's going to appear.

04:44.176 --> 04:46.762
- Voodoo?
- Really.

04:46.929 --> 04:51.475
Sam, let me have two vodka rocks.
Where are those Bloody Marys?

04:51.642 --> 04:56.020
I'm way behind. Coach is supposed
to be back from Phoenix.

04:56.187 --> 04:59.731
He's there
for T-Bone Scappagione's funeraI.

04:59.898 --> 05:02.318
His best friend.

05:02.485 --> 05:06.655
They were team-mates
in the minors and coached for the Sox.

05:06.821 --> 05:11.785
- How come you didn't go, Sam?
- It's funny. I never cared for the guy.

05:11.951 --> 05:16.623
Let's face it.
Taste in people isn't your strong point.

05:18.749 --> 05:22.670
Ah, yes. How would we manage
without Carla's wit?

05:22.836 --> 05:26.839
Carla, how do you manage without it?

05:28.883 --> 05:33.638
- What don't you like about this T-Bone?
- Lots of things.

05:33.805 --> 05:39.810
He's the kind of guy who can't pass
a mirror without checking himself out.

05:39.977 --> 05:43.897
Thinks he's God's gift to women.
You know the kind.

05:44.063 --> 05:50.403
All right. There's a difference
between thinking it and knowing it.

05:58.410 --> 06:01.371
- Hi, everybody.
- Where have you been?

06:01.538 --> 06:06.626
I'm sorry I'm late, but T-Bone wanted
to be buried in the family plot

06:06.793 --> 06:09.087
and I brought the body back.

06:09.254 --> 06:14.216
Did he die of a mysterious ailment
that turns you to cardboard?

06:14.383 --> 06:16.592
The body's at the mortuary.

06:16.759 --> 06:22.433
This is a promotionaI thing we did when
we were at the Birmingham Barons.

06:22.598 --> 06:28.896
Old T-Bone, he saved it all these years,
so I brought it back for Cheers.

06:29.062 --> 06:32.816
- Some luck, Sam?
- Words faiI me, Coach.

06:33.024 --> 06:37.028
It will be like having my old buddy
back with me here.

06:37.195 --> 06:40.365
Actually, I think this will be better.

06:40.532 --> 06:43.200
Sam, that's a wonderfuI thought.

06:43.367 --> 06:49.665
I'll put this in my office for safekeeping.
I'd hate to see it get stolen.

06:50.666 --> 06:52.877
How was the funeraI, Coach?

06:53.085 --> 06:57.255
Actually, Diane, it was kind of gloomy.

07:01.091 --> 07:06.097
Well, you know, after all,
it's hardly an occasion for rejoicing.

07:06.264 --> 07:10.893
Everything was perfectly nice.
It was really a nice ceremony,

07:11.059 --> 07:14.812
but they didn't say much
about the reaI T-Bone.

07:14.979 --> 07:19.192
He's been living in Phoenix
for a couple of years

07:19.358 --> 07:21.986
and those people didn't know him.

07:22.153 --> 07:26.240
They should have had the funeraI here,
where his pals are.

07:26.407 --> 07:31.077
Right. They didn't even know
why they called him T-Bone.

07:31.244 --> 07:33.454
Why did they call him T-Bone?

07:33.621 --> 07:37.209
I don't know.
I was hoping to find out.

07:42.379 --> 07:47.550
- I just had a wonderfuI idea.
- Could we get you not to tell us?

07:47.717 --> 07:52.680
Not a prayer. Why couldn't we have
a memoriaI right here?

07:52.847 --> 07:58.102
We could invite T-Bone's buddies
and they could toast his memory.

07:58.269 --> 08:03.482
That's a terrific idea. Everybody
could talk about the reaI T-Bone.

08:03.649 --> 08:06.108
I'll make a list of guys to call.

08:06.275 --> 08:09.363
Guys mourning
isn't good for business.

08:09.529 --> 08:11.531
They mourn, they drink.

08:11.698 --> 08:15.409
Call me a sentimentaI old fooI,
but I'm for it.

08:20.997 --> 08:26.378
What you've written here is beautifuI,
but you know what it could use?

08:26.544 --> 08:29.631
A little bit more about T-Bone himself.

08:29.798 --> 08:32.256
OK. Tell me about him.

08:32.424 --> 08:36.053
In his playing days,
he was a good hitter.

08:36.220 --> 08:39.515
His prowess at the plate was legendary.

08:39.682 --> 08:43.309
He was a fair hitter, Diane. Fair.
For the minors.

08:43.477 --> 08:45.561
He was a capable batsman.

08:45.728 --> 08:50.149
All those hits he got were
a lot of scratch and field hits.

08:50.316 --> 08:53.069
His best moments were off the field.

08:53.236 --> 08:57.406
That's the idea.
He always made the guys laugh.

08:57.572 --> 09:01.201
He was loved
for his sense of humour.

09:01.368 --> 09:04.161
He was always making fun of people.

09:05.246 --> 09:07.540
We admired his sardonic wit.

09:07.707 --> 09:11.919
I've seen him ride guys
till they were reduced to tears.

09:12.086 --> 09:15.715
He was a hatefuI and terrible person.

09:15.881 --> 09:18.466
Why don't you stick with what I had?

09:18.633 --> 09:22.512
You're right.
I'd better go practise.

09:27.642 --> 09:30.894
Hello. I've heard a lot about you.

09:31.061 --> 09:35.606
Well, hold on a sec and I'll check.
Are you in for Vera?

09:37.692 --> 09:41.405
Sure. She's out of town.
What can it hurt?

09:43.489 --> 09:46.117
Tracked me down?

09:46.284 --> 09:51.121
I miss you. It hasn't been the same
without you around the house.

09:51.288 --> 09:55.083
How's your mum? You're at our house?

09:55.250 --> 09:57.294
Since when?

09:57.461 --> 09:59.588
You never left?

10:01.922 --> 10:06.260
I thought I heard
someone in the john this morning.

10:09.179 --> 10:14.476
I can't believe this man was vain.
Does this picture do him justice?

10:14.642 --> 10:18.980
Only a firing squad
would do him justice.

10:19.147 --> 10:22.149
What is your problem with this man?

10:22.316 --> 10:26.488
- I know something nobody else does.
- Like what?

10:26.654 --> 10:29.114
Just trust me.
It's very sleazy.

10:29.281 --> 10:34.410
- This sounds serious. Tell me what it is.
- I can't. I'm sorry.

10:34.577 --> 10:36.996
Would you like another sweater?

10:37.163 --> 10:42.126
Once, when Coach was out of town,
this was a long time ago,

10:42.293 --> 10:46.296
T- Bone made a play for his wife Angela.

10:47.923 --> 10:51.635
- The rakehell.
- He didn't get anywhere with her.

10:51.801 --> 10:55.513
She told me
after keeping it a secret for so long.

10:55.679 --> 10:59.767
She was afraid to tell Coach.
It would have made him crazy.

10:59.934 --> 11:01.977
- The scum.
- I know.

11:02.144 --> 11:07.398
Making a play for his best friend's wife.
Even you wouldn't do that.

11:07.565 --> 11:10.151
Thank you for that, Diane.

11:10.318 --> 11:16.658
I can't take credit for that because most
of my friends' wives are reaI uggos.

11:20.452 --> 11:24.705
Let's pray this secret
goes to the grave with T-Bone.

11:24.872 --> 11:30.754
I hope so, cos if Coach ever finds out,
it would put him right in the toilet.

11:37.926 --> 11:41.638
Where do you want to put this
for the ceremony?

11:44.182 --> 11:48.019
In that case,
where would you like Diane to stand?

12:05.634 --> 12:08.678
- Coach, I know...
- I hate him, Sam.

12:08.845 --> 12:14.309
You have to put this behind you.
Angela and T-Bone are in heaven now.

12:14.476 --> 12:17.812
Let's hope he's not hitting on her
up there.

12:23.691 --> 12:26.945
I just wish Angela had told me about it.

12:27.112 --> 12:31.950
A man and a woman shouldn't
keep secrets from each other.

12:32.117 --> 12:37.121
- I don't think I agree with you, Coach.
- You don't?

12:37.287 --> 12:44.545
I don't think so. Let's take an outlandish
example, like us, for instance.

12:44.711 --> 12:51.968
In the unlikely event that you'd ever
succumb to a momentary temptation,

12:52.134 --> 12:56.638
I would prefer,
hypothetically, to remain oblivious.

12:56.805 --> 12:58.890
You got it.

13:01.852 --> 13:06.439
- What do you mean by that?
- I was going along with what you said.

13:06.606 --> 13:11.735
- You went along pretty fast.
- When you're right, you're right.

13:11.902 --> 13:15.196
You said it
like you had something in mind.

13:15.364 --> 13:19.410
- I don't.
- You'd better not.

13:19.577 --> 13:22.537
- I don't. I swear.
- Tell the truth.

13:22.704 --> 13:27.416
- That is the truth.
- Good. Then I wouldn't want to know.

13:30.962 --> 13:36.258
Now I see what you've been up to
all this time, you...

13:36.425 --> 13:42.388
You're trying to drive her crazy,
so she'll kill herself.

13:43.472 --> 13:48.728
- I love it. If I can be of any help at all.
- I'll keep you in mind.

13:51.689 --> 13:55.984
- Hey, Ernie.
- Hey, Artie.

13:56.151 --> 13:59.486
It's good to see you
after all these years.

13:59.653 --> 14:02.449
- You look great.
- I feeI fine.

14:02.616 --> 14:07.828
It could be happier circumstances.
When did you hear the shocking news?

14:07.995 --> 14:11.498
I was in the john
and I overheard Sam and Diane.

14:11.665 --> 14:15.627
- You mean you knew about it?
- It's in all the papers.

14:15.793 --> 14:17.838
Oh, my God.

14:18.921 --> 14:22.634
The afternoon edition even had pictures.

14:22.800 --> 14:25.969
- I'm a laughing stock.
- You misunderstood.

14:26.136 --> 14:29.931
It's great you're having a ceremony
for T-Bone.

14:30.098 --> 14:35.354
There ain't going to be a ceremony
for T-Bone, Artie. That filthy pig.

14:35.520 --> 14:38.856
- Why, Coach?
- You read it in the papers!

14:39.940 --> 14:45.195
- Coach, he's talking about him dying.
- There's nothing to say.

14:45.362 --> 14:49.950
Come into my office to talk.
Arthur, have a drink on the house.

14:50.117 --> 14:53.370
Carla, help him get a drink there, please.

14:54.913 --> 14:59.666
- What the hell are you doing?
- I'm going to help you with Coach.

14:59.833 --> 15:06.423
I've known him for 20 years. I think
by now I've an idea how to help him.

15:06.590 --> 15:10.468
Fine. I'll be waiting right here,
when you faiI.

15:10.635 --> 15:13.679
When and if you faiI.

15:14.472 --> 15:16.431
More when.

15:18.141 --> 15:22.729
Come on. You have go through with this.
The guys will be there.

15:22.896 --> 15:26.191
He betrayed me.
I loved him like a brother.

15:26.358 --> 15:31.654
Once they threatened to send him down
to a double-A club and I swear to you,

15:31.821 --> 15:36.826
I went and said, "You send T-Bone
down, you gotta send me down, too. "

15:36.992 --> 15:40.454
- I did.
- As I recall, you liked it down there.

15:40.621 --> 15:43.748
We had a great time.
Why did he do it to me?

15:43.915 --> 15:49.044
Coach, I don't know. Listen to me.
It was a one-time thing, Coach.

15:49.211 --> 15:55.008
He lost his head once. You're going
to have to accept it and forgive him.

15:55.175 --> 15:58.679
But why did he do it?

15:58.846 --> 16:03.724
I can't answer that. I just hate
watching it eat you up like this.

16:03.891 --> 16:06.395
I wish I could cheer you up.
Wait.

16:06.562 --> 16:10.022
You haven't seen this.
This is great.

16:10.189 --> 16:13.442
Look at this.
Don't I look like a dink?

16:16.444 --> 16:21.449
Ordinarily, Sam, that would have me
on the floor, but not today.

16:22.909 --> 16:26.954
Pull yourself out of this. It's in the past.

16:27.121 --> 16:30.749
For him, it's the past.
For me, it's just happening.

16:35.044 --> 16:37.464
I can help you, Coach.

16:38.757 --> 16:41.467
Let your subconscious speak to me.

16:41.634 --> 16:47.848
Work through your feelings about
T- Bone. They need to be released.

16:48.015 --> 16:51.184
If he was here, I'd release all his teeth.

16:51.351 --> 16:58.275
That's good. Tell T-Bone how angry
you are to work through your feelings.

16:58.442 --> 17:01.652
Come on, Diane, T-Bone's dead.

17:01.819 --> 17:06.071
No, he isn't. Here's T-Bone right here.

17:06.239 --> 17:09.952
- Spill your guts to him.
- This isn't a good idea.

17:10.118 --> 17:13.663
- It'll help him.
- I hate looking silly.

17:19.752 --> 17:22.212
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?

17:22.378 --> 17:27.925
It has to be deeper, Sam,
like "Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?"

17:28.093 --> 17:33.431
Right. He'd talk and he'd wipe his nose.
Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?

17:33.598 --> 17:38.603
It's "Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?"
and then he'd wipe it that way.

17:38.770 --> 17:41.189
After.

17:41.356 --> 17:46.068
- Hey, Ernie, how are you doing?
- The sniff has to be louder.

17:46.234 --> 17:50.488
- The sniff is fine.
- Will you two please stop?

17:52.823 --> 17:54.868
That is irrelevant.

17:55.035 --> 17:58.829
Something is eating away
at Coach's guts. Address that.

18:01.415 --> 18:05.126
Ernie,
your wife was a wonderfuI woman.

18:05.293 --> 18:09.215
She was really beautifuI.
I lost my head.

18:09.382 --> 18:15.637
Can you blame me for going crazy about
something I could never have myself?

18:16.762 --> 18:18.931
She was the best.

18:20.015 --> 18:22.226
Nobody could resist her.

18:24.353 --> 18:27.731
Come on.
Go out and make that speech for me.

18:28.857 --> 18:34.695
Come on. The people out there think that
I'm a reaI nice guy and a good friend.

18:34.862 --> 18:36.905
Leave me that.

18:37.989 --> 18:42.202
T- Bone, what you did,
I can never forgive you for.

18:42.369 --> 18:47.624
Never. You're dead and there's only
one way I can get even with you.

18:47.791 --> 18:51.418
It's to go out and do you in
and I'm going to do it.

18:51.585 --> 18:54.630
- Coach, come on.
- Stay away from me!

18:59.635 --> 19:04.305
Everybody, thanks for coming,
but let's get this over with.

19:04.472 --> 19:09.810
- The memoriaI service is about to begin.
- Last call before the memoriaI!

19:10.937 --> 19:14.648
Don't do this.
It won't make you feeI any better.

19:14.815 --> 19:18.360
I'm feeling better just thinking about it.

19:21.904 --> 19:24.240
OK, everybody's sat?

19:24.407 --> 19:28.286
All right, I had a beautifuI speech
written here,

19:28.452 --> 19:35.125
but I'd rather say a few things from my
own heart about T-Bone Scappagione.

19:35.292 --> 19:40.045
- Coach, don't...
- Just let me get it over with, Sam.

19:41.882 --> 19:45.302
T- Bone Scappagione was a son of a...

19:48.178 --> 19:50.556
That man was a son of a...

20:00.356 --> 20:04.319
T- Bone Scappagione
was the son of an immigrant.

20:07.863 --> 20:11.366
Like most immigrants,
he was a human being.

20:20.916 --> 20:26.171
Human beings make mistakes.
We're just not perfect.

20:27.505 --> 20:30.968
But I'll tell you what isn't a mistake.

20:31.134 --> 20:37.140
To love someone and to forgive them,
no matter what his shortcomings.

20:38.599 --> 20:40.768
That's not a mistake.

20:43.855 --> 20:48.108
I loved that man... and I forgive him.

20:50.860 --> 20:53.946
And I know that, for the rest of my life,

20:54.113 --> 20:59.369
every day, there's going to be a moment
when I'm going to miss him.

21:02.372 --> 21:04.998
That's all I've got to say.

21:11.295 --> 21:13.547
That was beautifuI, Ernie.

21:13.714 --> 21:16.342
- Thanks, Artie.
- No, I mean it.

21:16.509 --> 21:21.597
That stuff could almost make me forgive
him for what he did to me.

21:21.764 --> 21:24.432
For what he did to you?

21:25.266 --> 21:27.394
What did he do?

21:28.395 --> 21:33.274
- He went after my wife.
- Yours, too?

21:33.441 --> 21:36.860
- You guys got off easy.
- What did he do to you?

21:37.027 --> 21:41.490
He borrowed $500 from me.
He never tried to pay me back.

21:41.657 --> 21:46.745
- That's worse than chasing our wives?
- I've seen your wives.

21:51.040 --> 21:55.627
Why beat around the bush?
Let's admit the guy was a fungo.

21:58.004 --> 22:02.717
I got to admit I still love him.
He never made a pass at my wife.

22:02.884 --> 22:07.638
Are you nuts? He was at your house
so often, he got maiI there.

22:09.098 --> 22:11.600
My wife would never cheat on me.

22:11.767 --> 22:14.894
He was the worst guy I ever knew.

22:15.061 --> 22:20.067
We shouldn't be honouring him.
We should be dancing on his grave.

22:22.569 --> 22:24.654
Come on.
What are you doing?

22:24.821 --> 22:29.449
Listen, you gotta forget
about how he was in life

22:29.616 --> 22:33.287
and remember him as he is now.

22:33.453 --> 22:35.581
Dead.

22:37.332 --> 22:40.042
I say we take that cardboard cutout

22:40.209 --> 22:45.131
and do to it what we should have done
to him while he was alive!

22:45.298 --> 22:47.925
Let's hang him in effigy!

22:48.092 --> 22:52.263
The hell with that,
let's hang him here in Boston!

24:49.451 --> 24:50.453
