WEBVTT

00:03.574 --> 00:05.274
Yo, why you look
so tired, my dude?

00:05.276 --> 00:07.042
Stayed up late
watching "New Jack City."

00:07.044 --> 00:09.144
That joint got fire-ass quotables.

00:09.146 --> 00:12.080
Sit your $5-ass down
before I make change.

00:12.082 --> 00:16.318
"Never liked you anyway,
pretty motherfucker."

00:16.320 --> 00:18.887
Bro, Wesley Snipes the GOAT...
"White Men Can't Jump,"

00:18.889 --> 00:20.055
"Passenger 57,"

00:20.057 --> 00:23.124
"To Wong Foo, Thanks for
Everything, Julie Newmar."

00:23.126 --> 00:24.926
Man, how you gonna name
that "Wong Foo" shit

00:24.928 --> 00:27.361
and not drop "Jungle Fever?"
Y'all don't know shit.

00:27.363 --> 00:29.096
Yeah, "Jungle Fever"
was my shit.

00:29.098 --> 00:31.132
Mama, I smoked the TV.

00:32.168 --> 00:34.202
Now pay attention
to the goddamn game!

00:34.204 --> 00:37.138
Damn Milk, I didn't know "Jungle
Fever" meant so much to you.

00:37.140 --> 00:39.372
Yeah, we enjoy watching
Snipes take down Beckys

00:39.374 --> 00:42.675
as much as anybody.
No need to get testy with Wesley.

00:42.677 --> 00:44.311
My bad, y'all.
I'm tripping.

00:44.313 --> 00:46.079
Uncle Joey got
my shit twisted.

00:46.081 --> 00:47.380
What'd you do now, Milk?

00:47.382 --> 00:48.982
He on some Ole
"send me away" 'cause

00:48.984 --> 00:51.084
my YouTube show
about to blow shit.

00:51.086 --> 00:54.087
You got a YouTube show?
What's it called?

00:54.089 --> 00:57.881
<i>"Got You, Motherfucka!"</i>

01:01.320 --> 01:03.754
<i>You put baby powder
in my blow dryer?</i>

01:03.756 --> 01:05.990
<i>Nah, I put blow
in your blow dryer.</i>

01:05.992 --> 01:07.024
<i>What?</i>

01:07.026 --> 01:08.025
<i>Got you, motherfucka.</i>

01:10.663 --> 01:12.630
<i>Milton, get down here; we're
gonna be late for synagogue.</i>

01:12.632 --> 01:13.831
<i>The hell?</i>

01:13.833 --> 01:15.866
<i>Is this honey?
Why would... Milton!</i>

01:16.869 --> 01:18.202
<i>Got you, motherfucka.</i>

01:22.375 --> 01:24.174
<i>Get out the car,
you cracker-ass cracker,</i>

01:24.176 --> 01:26.477
<i>- and leave the shit running.
- Please, don't hurt me.</i>

01:26.479 --> 01:28.512
<i>Knew you was a
mark-ass bitch, caa!</i>

01:28.514 --> 01:29.947
<i>Milton!</i>

01:31.350 --> 01:35.753
<i>- G-G-Got you, moth...
- That's it, Milton! You're out!</i>

01:37.223 --> 01:39.023
So that square
Uncle Joey booted me,

01:39.025 --> 01:41.191
signed me up for the
student exchange program.

01:41.193 --> 01:43.927
Oh, for real?
Foreign breezies love Americans.

01:43.929 --> 01:46.730
Where he sending you?
France, Japan, Swedish?

01:46.732 --> 01:49.900
- Man, ... Ubombastan.
- Damn, Milk.

01:49.902 --> 01:52.603
Well, I'm finna just pour out
a little something for you now.

01:52.605 --> 01:53.871
What's that supposed to mean?

01:53.873 --> 01:55.639
It means you better
learn how to throw rocks

01:55.641 --> 01:57.639
'cause you dead, motherfucka!

01:57.874 --> 02:00.277

<i><font color="cyan"> sync & correction by f1nc0

02:05.504 --> 02:07.137
Up late watching
more Snipes films?

02:07.139 --> 02:09.473
Not exactly;
C-SPAN broadcast a debate

02:09.475 --> 02:11.675
concerning the contradictions
of the Second Amendment.

02:11.677 --> 02:12.943
I couldn't turn away.

02:12.945 --> 02:15.746
How ironic that 150 years
after his assassination,

02:15.748 --> 02:19.249
the Party of Lincoln is in favor
of allowing guns in theaters.

02:19.251 --> 02:21.518
My sentiments exactly.

02:21.520 --> 02:23.987
I ain't gonna lie, this shit
is weird without Milk here

02:23.989 --> 02:25.722
reinforcing negative stereotypes.

02:25.724 --> 02:27.424
You ain't never lied.
Look at me.

02:27.426 --> 02:28.959
I'm eating kale.

02:28.961 --> 02:31.695
There's no way that wigger
would let me eat kale.

02:31.697 --> 02:32.796
<i>Ow!</i>

02:32.798 --> 02:34.998
Oh, shit, white boy's missing.
Oh, well!

02:35.000 --> 02:36.633
<i>- Black-on-black crime!
- Ow!</i>

02:36.635 --> 02:39.770
Damn, homey, we need to find
a Milk replacement quick.

02:45.744 --> 02:48.812
- Where you going, homey?
- Uh, to the bathroom?

02:48.814 --> 02:51.548
That's all you better be doing.
That goes for all y'all.

02:51.550 --> 02:53.818
I swear if I hear any one
of you sand marks hollering

02:53.819 --> 02:56.086
gibberish, I'll jihad
the shit out of your ass.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.055
- See about me.
- You, shut up, sit down.

02:58.057 --> 03:01.095
Who said that?
Stand your bitch-ass up.

03:01.927 --> 03:04.027
Aw, man, I didn't know
one time was on this shit.

03:09.502 --> 03:11.768
Thank you, Marshall.

03:11.770 --> 03:13.070
He got some potential.

03:13.072 --> 03:14.905
Working parents,
two cars, a house.

03:14.907 --> 03:16.607
So you know the
credit score is strong.

03:16.609 --> 03:18.542
We might need to put
a phone in his name one day.

03:18.544 --> 03:20.110
A couple of red flags, though.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.979
He has three siblings,
so disposable income

03:21.981 --> 03:23.013
might be limited.

03:23.015 --> 03:24.882
And looking at
his mom's Facebook page,

03:24.884 --> 03:28.585
- her titties is average, at best.
- 'Tis true. Next!

03:28.587 --> 03:31.488
- State your name, please.
- I'm Brad Deekenmouf.

03:31.490 --> 03:33.357
Thanks for the great
opportunity, guys.

03:33.359 --> 03:35.492
Say your last name again.

03:35.494 --> 03:36.493
Deekenmouf.

03:37.463 --> 03:38.829
One more time, please.
Slower.

03:38.831 --> 03:41.532
Deek-en-mouf.
It's German.

03:41.534 --> 03:43.233
Okay, Deekenmouf,
as you know,

03:43.235 --> 03:45.536
we're looking for a token
white guy to kick it with us.

03:45.538 --> 03:48.105
What do you bring to the table
that we might not see here?

03:48.107 --> 03:49.640
Well, I'm on
the student council,

03:49.642 --> 03:52.376
so I have access to hall passes,
the teachers' lounge,

03:52.378 --> 03:53.944
and Half-Day Fridays.

03:53.946 --> 03:56.713
What brand of macaroni
would I find in your cupboards?

03:56.715 --> 03:59.449
We don't have a cupboard;
we have a walk-in pantry.

03:59.451 --> 04:01.218
 I thought
those only existed in movies.

04:01.220 --> 04:03.820
And to answer your question, Velveeta.

04:03.822 --> 04:06.492
You got the job, homey.

04:11.063 --> 04:12.563
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, we will begin</i>

04:12.565 --> 04:14.898
<i>our descent into Ubombastan
in a few short moments.</i>

04:16.535 --> 04:18.135
<i>Thank you for flying Air Persian,</i>

04:18.137 --> 04:19.236
<i>where we're just as happy</i>

04:19.238 --> 04:22.472
<i>to land safely as you are, ha-ha.</i>

04:23.742 --> 04:25.909
Damn, my nigs, these
Thotty Pippens out here

04:25.911 --> 04:27.778
looking staler than
dollar store bread.

04:27.780 --> 04:29.046
I'll still eat, though.

04:30.950 --> 04:33.450
Maybe the new exchange
student will help mix it up.

04:33.452 --> 04:35.218
- Is it a girl?
- She sure is.

04:35.220 --> 04:37.054
I was picked by the
principal to chaperone her,

04:37.056 --> 04:38.655
but why don't we
chaperone her together?

04:38.657 --> 04:41.325
- It could be fun.
- Decent idea, my nig.

04:41.327 --> 04:42.926
Thanks, my nigs.
Ow!

04:42.928 --> 04:45.829
You doing good, Deekenmouf,
but don't take it there, my dude.

04:45.831 --> 04:50.934
<i>♪ My burka

04:50.936 --> 04:54.237
<i>♪ My burka ♪

04:54.239 --> 04:55.772
- Damn.
- Ah.

04:55.774 --> 04:57.474
Oh, she think she cute, huh?

04:57.476 --> 04:59.042
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

04:59.044 --> 05:01.645
Hi, I'm Brad Deekenmouf.

05:01.647 --> 05:03.380
These are my friends,
Grover and Jamal.

05:03.382 --> 05:04.381
We're your chaperones.

05:04.383 --> 05:06.450
Am pleased to meet you.
I am Isis.

05:06.452 --> 05:10.053
Oh, that's a pretty name
and a sexy body, Isis.

05:10.055 --> 05:13.890
Bet you "be heading"
dudes back home.

05:13.892 --> 05:16.426
When you need somebody to
show you what's good at Duncan,

05:16.428 --> 05:19.062
ask for the sexy booty
captain of the hoop squad,

05:19.064 --> 05:20.197
uh...me.

05:20.199 --> 05:22.232
I believe someone
already has that job.

05:22.234 --> 05:23.500
Nah, baby, you don't get it.

05:23.502 --> 05:25.769
I'm the king ding-a-lang
around here, all right?

05:25.771 --> 05:27.404
You want to be
seen with me, not...

05:29.174 --> 05:30.374
Be right there, bae.

05:30.376 --> 05:33.010
Come on, Isis,
let's get you checked in.

05:36.015 --> 05:38.148
- Mm, mm-mm.
- Damn.

05:38.150 --> 05:39.916
Let me holler at you
for a second, Grover.

05:39.918 --> 05:41.752
I know you're gonna
try to hit that, right?

05:41.754 --> 05:45.055
I'll probably invade her Gaza Strip,
if she play her cards right.

05:45.057 --> 05:47.758
I'd do anything to see
that body bucket-naked.

05:47.760 --> 05:49.893
Let's make a deal:
get me a naked picture

05:49.895 --> 05:53.330
of Isis before the next game,
and I'll pull a couple of groins

05:53.332 --> 05:55.298
and let you take
my spot for one game.

05:55.300 --> 05:57.567
But if you trick it off,
you have to wear

05:57.569 --> 05:59.336
a burka on the bench.
Bet?

05:59.338 --> 06:00.671
- You're on.
- Good shit.

06:00.673 --> 06:03.240
Game's in two days.
Looking forward to that picture.

06:03.242 --> 06:06.943
I know it's gonna be "the bomb."

06:07.980 --> 06:09.246
Man, fuck y'all.

06:09.248 --> 06:10.514
Man, what's up with
you and that fish,

06:10.516 --> 06:11.848
some buddy-buddy type shit?

06:11.850 --> 06:13.917
He gonna try to get a picture
of that new girl naked.

06:13.919 --> 06:15.118
I'll forward it to the coach,

06:15.120 --> 06:17.287
tell him where it came from,
and boom!

06:17.289 --> 06:18.822
That's the end of the shit crew.

06:18.824 --> 06:20.390
Oh! You a cold-blooded genius,

06:20.392 --> 06:22.592
Randy, on some "black-ass
Stephen Hawking" type shit.

06:22.594 --> 06:23.894
I don't know what he wanted,

06:23.896 --> 06:26.196
but I do know that you can't
trust his mark ass.

06:26.198 --> 06:27.964
He wants me to get
a naked pic of Isis.

06:27.966 --> 06:30.400
So we gonna get the pic,
put it on Randy's phone,

06:30.402 --> 06:31.835
and make sure Cindy see it.

06:31.837 --> 06:34.304
Next thing you know,
she's calling me for comfort.

06:34.306 --> 06:36.506
And guess what?
Here I come, here I come.

06:36.508 --> 06:38.141
<i>Here I kitty-come-come.</i>

06:38.143 --> 06:41.858
Watch me whip.
Watch me nae nae, fellas.

06:42.681 --> 06:45.042
This nigga.

06:49.012 --> 06:50.645
Let's see what kind of
third-world shithole

06:50.647 --> 06:51.980
they got your boy in.

06:51.982 --> 06:53.982
I know it's gonna smell
like hummus and poverty.

06:58.021 --> 06:59.955
You are the one they call "Milk?"

06:59.957 --> 07:02.324
- Depends on who asking.
- I am Isil.

07:02.326 --> 07:04.259
They exchanged you
for my sister, Isis.

07:04.261 --> 07:06.861
I am your host for
your stay in Ubombastan.

07:06.863 --> 07:08.663
- Milk?
- Yeah, what's up?

07:08.665 --> 07:11.566
Do you like to... turn up?

07:15.939 --> 07:18.039
She's straight messing up
the vibe around here.

07:18.041 --> 07:21.076
It's our jobs to look cute
and get flirted with.

07:21.078 --> 07:22.610
I mean, who does
she think she is

07:22.612 --> 07:24.245
coming over here,
taking our jobs?

07:24.247 --> 07:27.949
All I know is my
Instagram likes is down 33%

07:27.951 --> 07:31.753
since this bitch showed up,
and it's only been a day. Ugh.

07:31.755 --> 07:34.022
I-K-R.
Isis got to go.

07:34.024 --> 07:36.358
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- She gots to go.</i>

07:36.360 --> 07:38.293
Her outfit is kind of cute, though.

07:38.295 --> 07:39.661
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

07:39.663 --> 07:42.731
Mm, now that you mention
it, girl, I would wear that.

07:42.733 --> 07:44.132
Y'all want to go join Isis?

07:44.134 --> 07:45.500
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

07:45.502 --> 07:47.402
Isis, hey, girl!

07:50.474 --> 07:51.473
Good day at school?

07:51.475 --> 07:53.308
Everyone was
very kind, thank you.

07:53.310 --> 07:55.043
Good, this is just
a routine check.

07:55.045 --> 07:56.478
It's random,
so don't be offended.

07:56.480 --> 07:59.381
- Everything is fine, Mr. Uncle Joey.
- Well that's good to...

07:59.383 --> 08:00.782
Hey, who told you
about that name?

08:00.784 --> 08:02.083
My name is Dave!

08:04.087 --> 08:06.955
I feel like she'd let me get in
them cheeks with a little effort.

08:06.957 --> 08:08.623
I'm just trying
to find a way to connect

08:08.625 --> 08:09.958
so I can get this photo op.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.460
All you got to do is bring her
a bean pie and a "Final Call,"

08:12.462 --> 08:14.562
rub her body down
with some essential oils

08:14.564 --> 08:16.464
while listening to
a Farrakhan mixtape,

08:16.466 --> 08:20.468
- and you in there, pimp.
- Different Islam, my nig.

08:20.470 --> 08:22.203
Maybe you could
learn about her culture.

08:22.205 --> 08:23.772
It'll give you something
to talk about with her.

08:23.774 --> 08:24.906
Come on, let me show you.

08:24.908 --> 08:28.443
Man, we just got off school,
and you talking about learning stuff.

08:28.445 --> 08:31.780
Not chilling, not chilling,
learning stuff.

08:34.017 --> 08:35.015
Oh.

08:35.018 --> 08:37.818
- Ledge.
- Yeah, I fucks with Deekenmouf.

08:37.821 --> 08:41.789
Okay, guys, let's fill
our heads with knowledge.

Man, these dust busters is
gangster-er than a mug,

08:58.875 --> 09:00.942
but I still don't know
how to get Isis naked.

09:00.944 --> 09:02.294
Does anybody else feel like

09:02.295 --> 09:05.447
blowing something up,
or is it just me?

09:08.452 --> 09:11.152
Milk, take my hand,
and I will show you

09:11.154 --> 09:13.088
<i>how we mehmooni in my home.</i>

09:13.090 --> 09:16.758
Okay then.

<i>Surprise!</i>

09:18.728 --> 09:20.929

09:20.931 --> 09:22.597
so let's give it up for my boy Milk.

09:22.599 --> 09:24.967
Jeah.

09:25.969 --> 09:27.902
Yo, how you know Eiht
was that dude for me?

09:27.904 --> 09:31.106
I did not know.
He is that dude for me, also.

09:42.152 --> 09:45.487
Kiss my black ass, America.
I ain't never coming back.

09:50.494 --> 09:53.194
Captain!
A Jew-American with spiky hair

09:53.196 --> 09:54.762
<i>is at an illegal mehmooni.</i>

09:54.764 --> 09:57.432
And he's dancing; he's drinking;
and he's high-fiving.

09:57.434 --> 10:00.702
<i>Spiky hair?
He's American and homosexual?</i>

10:00.704 --> 10:03.771
He does not leave alive.

10:07.410 --> 10:09.544
- Hey, Grover.
- Cindy?

10:13.049 --> 10:16.551
Nicca, whaaaat?

10:16.553 --> 10:17.919
Which one is Isis?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.754
♪ Tick-tock
tick-tock ♪

10:19.756 --> 10:21.222
♪ One day left
if you want my spot ♪

10:21.224 --> 10:22.490
Hey, man.

10:22.492 --> 10:24.692
Ugh, what the hell are
all these chickenheads wearing?

10:24.694 --> 10:26.227
Man, these chicks on some
new and improved

10:26.229 --> 10:27.996
Original Recipe KFC type shit.

10:27.998 --> 10:29.731
Over there, is that Isis?

10:32.636 --> 10:35.570
Yeah, that's her. I recognize
that ass from my dreams.

10:35.572 --> 10:36.571
We should follow her.

10:36.573 --> 10:38.973
You guys want to skip school?
That's awesome.

10:38.975 --> 10:42.143
I've always wanted to skip school.
Y'all are so cool.

10:42.145 --> 10:44.612
Man, stop being a white-ass nig!

10:44.614 --> 10:45.847
I'm saying, though, that's why

10:45.849 --> 10:48.016
"Rugrats" is really about
black genocide.

10:48.018 --> 10:50.251
And man, don't even
get me started on "Frozen."

10:50.253 --> 10:51.753
What's up, little brody?

10:51.755 --> 10:53.321
You see a girl in a burka
come through here?

10:53.323 --> 10:54.856
Burka, huh?
Yeah, I got mixed feelings

10:54.858 --> 10:56.224
- about those.
- Malik...

10:56.226 --> 10:58.560
On one hand, I can appreciate
the chastity it promotes.

10:58.562 --> 11:00.395
Our women could stand
to be a little more modest.

11:00.397 --> 11:01.930
- Ain't nobody got time for...
- But on the other hand,

11:01.932 --> 11:03.965
seeing that it's advocated
by theocracies bent on

11:03.967 --> 11:06.067
controlling minds and souls
with subjectively interpreted

11:06.069 --> 11:08.169
rhetoric from a book written
thousands of years ago,

11:08.171 --> 11:10.538
- can't say I'm with that.
- All right, Malik, great.

11:10.540 --> 11:11.706
Can you just tell me
if you've seen her?

11:11.708 --> 11:14.209
- Why you looking for her?
- He needs to get a nudie of her.

11:14.211 --> 11:15.210
A what-ie of her?

11:15.212 --> 11:17.111
- Naked picture.
- Naked girl?

11:17.113 --> 11:19.047
Ew! Don't you know they got
cooties, man?

11:19.049 --> 11:20.248
What's wrong with you, man?

11:21.618 --> 11:23.785
You know what, just do you, man.
She went that way.

11:23.787 --> 11:25.820
Thanks, little guy.
High five.

11:27.123 --> 11:28.690
Right on.

11:30.260 --> 11:31.292
Aye, there she go.

11:31.294 --> 11:34.395
- She skip school to go sight-seeing?
- Looks like it.

11:37.067 --> 11:38.633
Let's move.

11:40.003 --> 11:44.105
Why would she go sight-seeing
at Brazy Bideon's?

11:48.278 --> 11:51.379
Damn, she boo-boo
at that flight simulator.

11:56.820 --> 11:59.153
You guys, I'm not
trying to insinuate anything,

11:59.155 --> 12:00.855
but first she goes to Brazy Bideon's,

12:00.857 --> 12:03.291
then to the arcade,
and now Home Deport?

12:03.293 --> 12:04.759
What you saying, Deekenmouf?

12:04.761 --> 12:07.362
Well, I think based on
what we've seen today,

12:07.364 --> 12:10.698
we might be dealing with...
a hobbyist.

12:12.936 --> 12:15.524
That's the new Wu-Tang.

12:21.385 --> 12:23.084
<i>Cindy, time for dinner!</i>

12:23.086 --> 12:25.754
<i>Praise the Lord,
we having pot pie tonight.</i>

12:25.756 --> 12:27.489
<i>Be right there, Daddy.</i>

12:27.491 --> 12:29.991
Lord Jesus in the sky.

12:29.993 --> 12:32.627
Cindy Louise Scrilla,
what is you wearing?

12:32.629 --> 12:34.963
Dad, don't be lame.
All the girls are wearing them.

12:34.965 --> 12:37.732
- She look like a ghetto Ewok.
- All the girls?

12:37.734 --> 12:41.102
- All what girls?
- The girls at school, Daddy. A-doy.

12:41.104 --> 12:42.637
She look like a Pac-Man ghost.

12:42.639 --> 12:45.140
And you think it's okay
after all the protesting

12:45.142 --> 12:47.259
and marches women have
gone through for you

12:47.260 --> 12:49.377
to be able to wear shorts
that show butt cheek

12:49.379 --> 12:52.047
and side meat
without being harassed?

12:52.049 --> 12:53.982
If your mother...
Jesus bless the dead...

12:53.984 --> 12:56.151
- could see you now.
- Ugh, you finished?

12:56.153 --> 12:58.119
Oh...
shalla-walla-walla-haka-shak!

12:58.121 --> 13:01.089
Girl, you know I'm upset when
I start speaking in tongues.

13:01.091 --> 13:03.925
<i>I am not finished yet...
Jesus take the wheel.</i>

13:03.927 --> 13:06.895
Who has you dressing like
a shower curtain, Cindy?

13:06.897 --> 13:08.396
Who?
Tell me who.

13:08.398 --> 13:11.466
Isis, Dad!
I was inspired by Isis.

13:14.237 --> 13:17.145
- She look like a Crown Royal bag.
- Give me my phone, boy.

13:22.379 --> 13:23.578
Damn, Jamal, you fat.

13:27.217 --> 13:28.350
She naked!

13:28.352 --> 13:30.518
Hold steady, I said she naked.

13:30.520 --> 13:31.686
Hey, you try to hold steady

13:31.688 --> 13:33.188
with Deekenmouf's ass
in your mouth.

13:33.190 --> 13:35.590
This is radical.

13:37.461 --> 13:38.626
<i>Ah.</i>

13:39.629 --> 13:41.529
Grover?
Come inside, please.

13:41.531 --> 13:42.630
Your friends too.

13:47.170 --> 13:50.372
Two little Mandingo boys
are breaking into

13:50.374 --> 13:52.540
a young girl's window.

13:52.542 --> 13:54.142
Lucky bitch.

13:54.144 --> 13:57.012
<i>Got you, motherfucka.</i>

13:57.014 --> 14:00.115
Wait, wait!
Stop everything!

14:00.117 --> 14:01.683
MC Eiht, quiet down!

14:01.685 --> 14:05.954
My friend, care to explain
what is on your father's head?

14:05.956 --> 14:08.690
My square-ass stepdad's
yarmulke; he Jewish.

14:09.693 --> 14:12.527
- Jeah!
- Hold up, was it something I said?

14:12.529 --> 14:17.032
Look, Milk, we like you very
much. You turn up nicely.

14:17.034 --> 14:20.969
But how you answer next
question is very important.

14:20.971 --> 14:23.138
What tribe you claiming?

14:23.140 --> 14:24.806
Nah, homey, you got it twisted.

14:24.808 --> 14:26.975
The dude who short-dicking
my mom is Jewish.

14:26.977 --> 14:29.244
I'm just step-Jew,
but on the inside,

14:29.246 --> 14:30.712
I'm all nig.
Ow!

14:32.616 --> 14:35.517
_

14:35.518 --> 14:38.654
_

14:38.655 --> 14:42.090
One time on the creep.
Eiht, Saudi 5,000, G, jeah.

14:42.092 --> 14:43.958
Come with me
if you want to live.

14:43.960 --> 14:46.027
You are wondering
what I am doing.

14:46.029 --> 14:48.930
I am making
special fireworks for U.S.A.

14:48.932 --> 14:50.899
I am...

14:50.901 --> 14:53.068
- a hobbyist.
- I knew it!

14:53.070 --> 14:54.636
That's cool and all, but fireworks

14:54.638 --> 14:56.371
ain't kosher
in Chamberlain Heights.

14:56.373 --> 14:58.073
I know this,
but I want to do this

14:58.075 --> 15:00.308
to show my appreciation;
I must.

15:00.310 --> 15:02.844
It is my passion.
It will be beautiful.

15:02.846 --> 15:04.712
Why was you
butt-booty naked, though?

15:04.714 --> 15:06.047
The chemicals I work with,

15:06.049 --> 15:08.783
like sulfur, are very, uh,
how you say,

15:08.785 --> 15:11.786
smell like shit.
Smell hard to get out of burka.

15:11.788 --> 15:13.021
Firework is ready.

15:13.023 --> 15:15.356
I will put burka on, and
we will detonate it together

15:15.358 --> 15:17.559
at Citi City Hall
with this remote control.

15:17.561 --> 15:19.294
In Ubombastan,
something like this

15:19.296 --> 15:21.996
would make us, uh,
like you say, uh,

15:21.998 --> 15:24.432
legendary.
This is acceptable?

15:29.139 --> 15:31.773
<i>We cannot have Isis
influencing our children.</i>

15:31.775 --> 15:34.242
Today they'll be covering
themselves in drapes,

15:34.244 --> 15:36.511
but tomorrow!
Tomorrow they'll be...

15:36.513 --> 15:38.746
Um, what else
do we know about Isis?

15:42.919 --> 15:44.519
She's a Muslim.

15:44.521 --> 15:46.287
Ah-shakawaka-lakka-lakka-
flocka-flame!

15:46.289 --> 15:49.257
Oh, that's it.
Let's get the camel jockey

15:49.259 --> 15:51.092
and her weird religion out of here.

15:51.094 --> 15:52.827
<i>Yeah! She has to go.</i>

15:52.829 --> 15:55.163
<i>I'm very upset
about her religious choice.</i>

16:07.344 --> 16:09.711
Milk, open the glove compartment.

16:09.713 --> 16:13.414
Aw, hell yeah, girl! We finna
wet some busters, n'ahimean?

16:13.416 --> 16:15.617
If we go out,
we go out shooting, together.

16:15.619 --> 16:18.153
Yo, you the most gangster-est
bitch I ever met.

16:18.155 --> 16:19.387
I think I love you.

16:19.389 --> 16:21.856
Tell me again later, my nig.

16:33.103 --> 16:35.303
Jesus is Lord; we're too late.

16:35.305 --> 16:36.437
- Somersault!
- Freeze!

16:36.439 --> 16:38.139
On the ground.
Hands where we can see them.

16:38.141 --> 16:40.441
We are here
on a suspected burglary.

16:40.443 --> 16:42.561
And you may not believe this, but we

16:42.562 --> 16:44.679
are looking for a young black male.

16:44.681 --> 16:46.614
I mean, y'all ain't got no
more description than that?

16:46.616 --> 16:48.550
Probably, but that was
more than enough for us.

16:48.552 --> 16:50.852
You could be young.
I never can tell with your people.

16:50.854 --> 16:54.656
No, it's not me!
We are looking for a girl named Isis.

16:54.658 --> 16:56.491
She's influencing our children!

16:56.493 --> 16:59.527
- To do what?
- She, um... to, uh,

16:59.529 --> 17:02.397
wear funky clothes, and, uh,
she's also a Muslim.

17:02.399 --> 17:04.632
A Muslim?
Not on my watch.

17:04.634 --> 17:07.301
Kennedy, I think I've got something.

17:07.304 --> 17:10.137
- Oh!
- That is fresh-smelling shit.

17:10.140 --> 17:12.207
And this, a video
on how to make fireworks.

17:12.209 --> 17:14.409
And those,
pictures of Citi City Hall.

17:14.411 --> 17:16.044
Wait a second,
you don't think that...

17:16.046 --> 17:18.347
Yes!
A Muslim hobbyist is going

17:18.348 --> 17:20.647
to shit on a firecracker
and go get gay married.

17:20.650 --> 17:23.184
This is exactly what President
Trump warned us about.

17:23.185 --> 17:24.685
Wait a damn minute,
isn't it more

17:24.688 --> 17:26.688
of a realistic possibility
that she's at Citi City Hall

17:26.690 --> 17:27.955
about to set off
illegal fireworks?

17:27.958 --> 17:29.424
Sir, please calm down
before I am

17:29.426 --> 17:31.626
forced to shoot you
and falsify the report!

17:31.628 --> 17:32.994
Jeez Louise!

17:32.996 --> 17:35.196
He's telling you that
Isis is at Citi City Hall

17:35.198 --> 17:36.898
about to set off fireworks!

17:36.900 --> 17:38.733
Ma'am, that's so crazy
it might be true.

17:38.735 --> 17:41.970
Thank you for your help.
And reverse somersault.

17:41.972 --> 17:44.172
Ooh, shanna-manna-bum-
stickity-bum-stickity-bum,

17:44.174 --> 17:45.406
we want offense.

17:47.143 --> 17:48.776
When you gonna come through
Chamberlain Heights

17:48.778 --> 17:50.663
- and holler at a pimp?
- Soon.

17:50.698 --> 17:53.081
Isis has been planning a
permanent move into America.

17:53.083 --> 17:55.550
I will join her,
and you can join me.

17:55.552 --> 17:57.919
You mean a permanent move
"to" America, right?

17:57.921 --> 17:59.254
Not "into" America.

18:00.657 --> 18:03.458
The point is, I want us
to be together forever.

18:03.460 --> 18:06.594
I love you, Milk.

18:07.931 --> 18:09.464
<i>Got you, motherfucker!</i>

18:09.466 --> 18:11.499
Damn, baby.

18:13.703 --> 18:16.437
Y'all missed me,
mark-ass dust busters.

18:16.439 --> 18:18.306
Aye, subscribe
to my channel, though.

18:20.477 --> 18:22.644
- Ready?
- A few words first.

18:22.646 --> 18:24.213
This is the best day of my life,

18:24.214 --> 18:25.780
you guys are my best friends,

18:25.782 --> 18:27.782
and there is nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

18:27.784 --> 18:29.784
No, scratch that,
we are not friends.

18:29.786 --> 18:33.488
You are my brothers, and sister.
Thanks a million.

18:33.490 --> 18:34.656
Freeze, lady Muslim!

18:34.658 --> 18:36.491
They made me do it!
I'm a hostage!

18:36.493 --> 18:38.926
- This nigga.
- Muslim girl in the karate dress,

18:38.928 --> 18:41.262
walk towards us slowly,
with your hands up!

18:41.264 --> 18:43.398
I do not mean any harm, please!

18:43.400 --> 18:45.867
- What would Snipes do?
- No, Jamal.

18:45.869 --> 18:49.337
- I'm doing it for Isis.
- You emotional right now, my nig.

18:49.339 --> 18:51.072
- Don't do anything...
- Snipes!

18:51.074 --> 18:52.106
Hi-ya!

18:52.108 --> 18:54.409
- Oh... ah!
- Jamal!

18:54.411 --> 18:57.378
Ah, I'm, oh... okay.

18:57.380 --> 19:00.281
- I'm sorry, Isis.
- You are a good guy, Grover.

19:00.283 --> 19:02.183
Now go, go!
Now!

19:02.185 --> 19:03.985
He's coming at us
like a wild animal!

19:06.756 --> 19:08.890
Put the device down,
or we will shoot.

19:08.892 --> 19:11.059
Real bullets this time.

19:22.172 --> 19:26.507
<i>Ooh, ah.</i>

19:26.509 --> 19:29.043
<i>Ooh.</i>

19:29.045 --> 19:33.314
It's beautiful, Isis. 
It's beautiful.

19:33.316 --> 19:35.783
Take off my clothes.

19:35.785 --> 19:40.221
Before I came to America,
I read news of your police.

19:40.223 --> 19:45.827
I expected this.

19:45.829 --> 19:50.131
♪ Farewell and adieu
to you, fair Persian lady ♪

19:50.133 --> 19:51.265
Bye, Muslim.

19:51.267 --> 19:53.983
I'm not dead, guy from "Jaws."

19:56.203 --> 19:59.170
Heard what happened with Isis,
but a bet's a bet.

20:00.674 --> 20:03.007
By the way, it's called a niqab.
