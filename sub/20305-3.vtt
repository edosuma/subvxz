00:01.001 --> 00:03.586
NARRATOR: <i>In the last episode</i>
<i>of</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:03.878 --> 00:06.089
Oh, I just won 100 grand!

00:06.172 --> 00:09.092
Get ready to roll 'em.
Okay, there you go. Roll 'em.

00:09.175 --> 00:10.093
(grunts)

00:10.176 --> 00:12.762
A man is moving
into the Dante Projects tomorrow

00:12.846 --> 00:15.348
-who's running for mayor.
-(laughter)

00:15.432 --> 00:17.267
You told me you was
gonna put me in charge.

00:17.350 --> 00:20.020
You lied, man, and all the time,
you're bringing him back, right?

00:20.103 --> 00:23.189
I don't care if I am six points
ahead in the polls,

00:23.273 --> 00:27.027
if we don't walk the line on this,
Fisk will close the gap like that.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.654
We're scheduled an hour earlier
for Lamaze class.

00:29.738 --> 00:32.365
-I wouldn't miss it.
-Home stretch, kiddo.

00:32.449 --> 00:35.368
You know, maybe you should invest
some of that money with Dale Carnegie.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.704
NARRATOR:
<i>And now, tonight on</i> Hill Street Blues...

00:37.787 --> 00:39.622
-He lose a lot?
-About ten grand.

00:39.706 --> 00:41.875
But I think you've got a cop
who's got a big problem.

00:41.958 --> 00:46.212
And you put Jesus Martinez in jail,
or this guy is gonna die!

00:46.296 --> 00:49.758
You have given me as much support
during these last three weeks

00:49.841 --> 00:51.718
as any man's ever given me
in my whole life.

00:51.801 --> 00:53.261
I'll always love you for it.

00:54.054 --> 00:54.888
(sighs)

00:58.266 --> 00:59.434
(indistinct conversations)

00:59.517 --> 01:02.395
ESTERHAUS: People, please!

01:02.479 --> 01:04.814
A smidgen of forbearance.

01:04.898 --> 01:06.357
Item 13...

01:07.358 --> 01:11.571
as we brace ourselves for a day
of record-breaking heat and humidity,

01:11.654 --> 01:14.115
the bad news, in addition
to the contrary nature

01:14.199 --> 01:16.701
of our less-than-central
air conditioning system

01:16.785 --> 01:19.746
is the usual rise in robberies,
aggravated assaults,

01:19.829 --> 01:21.331
and domestic disputes.

01:21.664 --> 01:22.749
The good news,

01:22.832 --> 01:26.586
it's only 88 shopping days till Christmas.

01:26.669 --> 01:29.506
-(groaning)
-(sarcastically) Yee-ha!

01:30.340 --> 01:32.717
Item 14, mayoral candidate Benjamin Fisk,

01:32.801 --> 01:34.552
with the aid of this precinct's finest,

01:34.803 --> 01:36.513
has passed one uneventful night

01:36.596 --> 01:40.058
as an official resident
of the Dante Projects.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.644
Now, when we're done here,
detectives LaRue and Washington

01:42.727 --> 01:44.687
will be relieving the night-shift officers

01:44.979 --> 01:47.273
and assuring Mr. Fisk
of another day free from harm

01:47.357 --> 01:48.691
in his chosen habitat,

01:48.942 --> 01:52.529
which is especially important
in view of item 15,

01:53.071 --> 01:56.699
another grim bulletin
from our war correspondents.

01:56.783 --> 02:00.453
A nine-year-old boy was killed
last night in a drive-by shooting,

02:00.537 --> 02:02.539
apparently a case of mistaken identity.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.792
The bullet was allegedly intended
for a member of Diablos.

02:06.584 --> 02:09.295
Educated speculation
would narrow responsibility

02:09.379 --> 02:10.296
to the Blood,

02:10.380 --> 02:13.341
their purpose being retaliation
for the death of one of their own,

02:13.424 --> 02:15.260
a Mr. Leon Selwood,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.972
who was found yesterday morning
hanging from a basketball hoop

02:19.055 --> 02:20.890
on a Diablos playground.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.975
(murmuring)

02:22.058 --> 02:23.852
The saga continues.

02:24.269 --> 02:26.646
Now, we will maintain
our pattern of high visibility

02:26.729 --> 02:29.774
for what dissuasion it may provide.

02:30.316 --> 02:32.610
I wish I could tell you
the end was in sight.

02:33.403 --> 02:35.155
Anybody got a pocketknife?

02:37.073 --> 02:37.907
Here.

02:37.991 --> 02:39.576
(laughter)

02:39.659 --> 02:42.829
Item last,
a note from our off-the-record department.

02:43.913 --> 02:46.916
Officer Bobby Hill invites you
to attend an event

02:47.000 --> 02:48.918
of great social import

02:49.002 --> 02:52.463
commencing circa 8:30 this evening
at the club Como.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.633
The occasion is a rent party
for officer Michael Perez,

02:55.717 --> 02:59.470
who has experienced a common
difficulty this month,

02:59.554 --> 03:02.765
falling somewhat short
of the landlord's due.

03:02.849 --> 03:05.185
Now, make a stop tonight, will you, folks?

03:05.560 --> 03:09.731
Now, if we haven't the compassion
to help one of our own, who can we help?

03:10.607 --> 03:12.317
All right, that's it. Let's roll.

03:13.026 --> 03:16.487
And let's be particularly
careful out there.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.781
(indistinct chattering)

03:25.288 --> 03:27.540
-Ba-bing, ba-bing.
-Funny stuff, J.D.

03:27.624 --> 03:29.083
Don Rickles can't sleep at night.

03:36.174 --> 03:38.384
-You know, you're a jerk, Bobby Hill.
-What?

03:38.468 --> 03:39.928
I ask you for a personal favor,

03:40.011 --> 03:42.305
and you make me some kind
of precinct charity case.

03:42.388 --> 03:43.556
I was trying to help you.

03:43.640 --> 03:46.059
Yeah, by showing everybody
what a swell guy you are, huh?

03:46.392 --> 03:49.062
Well, you're terrific, okay?
I mean, you're a real prince.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.855
Just take it easy, okay?

03:52.649 --> 03:53.483
Shoot.

03:54.317 --> 03:55.485
Food for thought there, bud.

04:02.492 --> 04:04.577
Yeah, I woke up this morning,
said to myself,

04:04.661 --> 04:06.454
"Gee, I hope it's 103 in the shade

04:06.537 --> 04:08.206
and I get to spend
the whole day in a tenement

04:08.289 --> 04:09.707
staring at rat droppings."

04:09.999 --> 04:12.585
Mm, looks like somebody else
is having a bad day.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.046
(siren wailing)

04:15.129 --> 04:16.214
(groans)

04:22.637 --> 04:24.973
We gotta get this guy to Mercy!
Find the arm and bring it in!

04:25.056 --> 04:27.016
-Arm? What arm?
-The left one! Hurry!

04:28.226 --> 04:30.937
(siren wailing, tires screech)

04:31.729 --> 04:33.231
-Hey, man, he didn't say arm.
-I think he did.

04:33.314 --> 04:35.316
-He didn't mean arm.
-I think he did.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.235
Look, this isn't for us, Neal, okay?

04:37.318 --> 04:38.361
The paramedics are on the way.

04:38.444 --> 04:40.446
-They like stuff like this.
-Hey, come on, J.D.

04:40.530 --> 04:41.823
Come on, man. They said find it fast.

04:41.906 --> 04:42.740
All right, all right.

04:44.075 --> 04:45.827
Okay. Okay? We looked, we didn't find it.

04:45.910 --> 04:47.412
How far could an arm go, huh?

04:48.204 --> 04:49.038
(woman gasps)

04:51.499 --> 04:52.333
Oh, boy.

04:55.920 --> 04:56.963
NEAL: Hey, I'll go get some ice.

04:57.046 --> 04:59.716
Oh, no, you don't. Well?

04:59.799 --> 05:00.967
I'm thinking. I'm thinking.

05:01.551 --> 05:02.885
-Take a number, one to ten.
-No way.

05:02.969 --> 05:04.554
Uh-uh.
You're the one that wanted to find it.

05:05.054 --> 05:05.888
Oh, damn.

05:06.014 --> 05:07.932
(indistinct chattering)

05:11.394 --> 05:12.520
(groans)

05:12.603 --> 05:13.521
Oh, man.

05:14.731 --> 05:15.940
(woman sobbing)

05:18.318 --> 05:21.195
-Ugh.
-WOMAN: It's just awful.

05:21.279 --> 05:22.113
Ugh.

05:25.366 --> 05:26.200
Come on.

05:29.329 --> 05:31.706
-(laughs)
-What?

05:31.789 --> 05:33.833
Take a look. 8:04.

05:34.584 --> 05:36.336
Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.921
(both laugh)

05:39.339 --> 05:41.841
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 91-1.</i>

05:41.924 --> 05:43.593
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

05:43.676 --> 05:47.472
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

05:47.555 --> 05:49.182
(sirens wailing)

05:54.604 --> 05:58.524
(theme music playing)

07:12.056 --> 07:13.683
You want to tell me about it or not?

07:14.892 --> 07:15.726
About what?

07:16.352 --> 07:17.728
Your breakfast, Joe.

07:17.812 --> 07:19.439
Did you take the girls out or what?

07:19.522 --> 07:21.441
Yeah, I took them out. So?

07:21.524 --> 07:25.027
So, I want to know what went on.
I mean, tell me exactly what you did.

07:25.653 --> 07:26.487
We had dinner.

07:27.363 --> 07:28.531
That's not what I'm talking about.

07:29.615 --> 07:31.576
Now, don't embarrass me, all right?
Just stop it.

07:32.410 --> 07:34.328
Hey, you weren't too embarrassed to do it.

07:34.704 --> 07:36.122
-And now you're judging me!
-I'm not.

07:36.205 --> 07:38.374
-You do that all the time!
-I'm not, I'm not, I swear.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.626
This just may be
the only chance I ever get

07:40.710 --> 07:42.003
to hear something like this.

07:43.504 --> 07:44.839
You know, you're backing me
right into a corner,

07:44.922 --> 07:46.174
-because no matter what I say...
-Joe.

07:46.257 --> 07:47.758
-...you're gonna get mad.
-No, that's not true.

07:47.842 --> 07:49.135
I mean, you're not giving me
any credit at all.

07:49.218 --> 07:52.180
-I'm just curious. That's all.
-You really want to know?

07:52.430 --> 07:54.390
Yeah, I am curious.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.560
It was unbelievable.

07:59.061 --> 08:02.648
It was the most incredible evening
of my entire life.

08:06.944 --> 08:08.488
-Go ahead.
-Oh...

08:09.489 --> 08:11.073
You know what the best part about it is?

08:11.908 --> 08:14.619
Those girls are as different
as night and day.

08:15.369 --> 08:17.663
Betty is, uh, is shy...

08:18.331 --> 08:20.875
not that she won't do anything
that you ask her to do.

08:22.460 --> 08:25.421
And Babette... oh, boy, she's, like...

08:25.505 --> 08:28.049
she's, like, all over the place. (laughs)
She's really--

08:28.132 --> 08:28.966
Stop--

08:30.343 --> 08:31.886
-Oh... (scoffs) Really great.
-What did you--?

08:31.969 --> 08:33.179
-What did you do that for?
-All right!

08:33.262 --> 08:34.639
Okay. All right.

08:35.223 --> 08:38.476
WOMAN (on radio): <i>All units in the area</i>
<i>of 1400 block Granville Avenue.</i>

08:38.559 --> 08:41.896
-Hey, let's go.
<i>-Man with gun. Shots fired. Man down.</i>

08:47.026 --> 08:49.862
(siren wailing)

08:54.033 --> 08:54.867
Drop the gun!

08:55.785 --> 08:56.619
Drop the gun!

08:57.370 --> 08:58.204
(gun thuds)

09:00.665 --> 09:02.041
All right, turn around,
put your hands on the car!

09:02.708 --> 09:04.710
(groans)

09:04.794 --> 09:06.587
You do not understand! He tried to rob me.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.798
That man has a knife! He tried to rob me!

09:08.881 --> 09:10.800
We'll talk about it later.
Right now you're under arrest.

09:12.093 --> 09:13.594
-I don't know. The guy's crazy.
-Take it easy.

09:13.678 --> 09:16.305
I'm putting five bucks through the window,
and the guy turns around and shoots me.

09:16.722 --> 09:17.723
Okay.

09:21.269 --> 09:23.896
Captain Furillo? John Fox, Vice, Midtown.

09:24.605 --> 09:26.482
-How are you?
-Fine, how are you?

09:26.566 --> 09:27.608
You mind if I talk to you for a minute?

09:28.025 --> 09:29.151
Uh, sure. Come on in.

09:29.944 --> 09:30.778
Sit down.

09:31.654 --> 09:33.906
Look, Captain, I've been working
on a high-rent crap game

09:33.990 --> 09:36.117
for a couple of weeks,
and last night we were gonna bust it,

09:36.659 --> 09:38.327
but then I recognized one of your guys.

09:38.619 --> 09:39.912
-Who?
-Bobby Hill.

09:39.996 --> 09:43.249
He joined the game about midnight
and didn't leave until after it broke up.

09:44.041 --> 09:45.084
I deferred the bust.

09:45.626 --> 09:46.586
You sure it was Hill?

09:46.919 --> 09:47.837
Absolutely.

09:48.337 --> 09:49.964
I'm surprised he didn't recognize me.

09:50.715 --> 09:51.799
But then, the way he looked last night,

09:51.882 --> 09:54.010
I'm not sure he would
recognize his own mother.

09:54.927 --> 09:56.929
Now, Captain,
I know he just won a lot of money,

09:57.013 --> 09:59.140
and you might argue
that he's having a good time,

09:59.515 --> 10:00.725
but I'm not so sure.

10:01.017 --> 10:02.184
He lose a lot?

10:02.268 --> 10:03.269
About ten grand.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.272
Now, Captain,
I hate to be the one to tell you this,

10:06.814 --> 10:09.358
but I think you've got a cop
who's got a big problem.

10:11.527 --> 10:13.529
I'm sorry you missed your bust.
I apologize.

10:14.488 --> 10:15.323
We'll get 'em.

10:18.284 --> 10:19.160
Thanks for coming.

10:19.493 --> 10:20.745
The IAD is busy enough.

10:21.078 --> 10:22.788
-Captain.
-Mick.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.124
I just came from downtown,
that IAD hearing.

10:25.207 --> 10:26.250
-And?
-And nothing.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.586
They asked me a bunch of stupid
questions and said I could go.

10:28.669 --> 10:30.588
-What happens now?
-They'll issue their report and call me.

10:30.671 --> 10:31.505
-When?

10:31.881 --> 10:33.007
Twenty-four hours.

10:34.925 --> 10:37.011
Captain, what I don't understand is this,

10:37.094 --> 10:38.471
if this guy is only doing this

10:38.554 --> 10:40.473
because he's got it out
for the precinct or something,

10:40.556 --> 10:41.641
when are you gonna get behind me?

10:41.724 --> 10:43.017
Mick, we've been over this.

10:43.309 --> 10:45.394
It's in everyone's best interest,
particularly yours,

10:45.478 --> 10:47.813
if I keep a low profile.
This isn't a unique situation.

10:47.897 --> 10:49.148
They'll see it for what it is.

10:49.231 --> 10:50.983
Meanwhile, I'm the one
that's gotta take the rap.

10:51.067 --> 10:53.319
Mick, you're the one who had
the guy up against the wall.

10:53.402 --> 10:55.196
That's a crock, Captain. He had it coming.

10:55.279 --> 10:58.157
You don't stick your hand
into a dogfight. You know that.

10:59.575 --> 11:01.243
-What do you want me to do?
-Stick to your desk.

11:01.327 --> 11:02.453
Okay, but I'll tell you one thing,

11:02.536 --> 11:05.081
I am not gonna be hung out
to dry for this.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.249
I'll quit before I let that happen.

11:07.333 --> 11:08.876
(sighs) Phil...

11:09.752 --> 11:10.711
Bobby Hill around?

11:11.087 --> 11:13.130
No, he left with Renko an hour ago.

11:13.214 --> 11:14.632
-Okay--
-Francis,

11:15.466 --> 11:18.094
do you know if Fay
is partial to the Peruvian lily?

11:20.137 --> 11:21.097
I'm not sure.

11:21.430 --> 11:23.891
You know how bleak
those hospital rooms can be.

11:24.392 --> 11:25.226
Look at this one.

11:26.185 --> 11:30.106
The planter is actually a music box
shaped like a cradle.

11:30.189 --> 11:32.066
It plays Brahms' "Lullaby."

11:32.358 --> 11:34.193
Uh, I'm sure she'll love it, Phil.

11:34.568 --> 11:35.611
Would you excuse me, please?

11:40.616 --> 11:42.868
I got your report
on last night's shooting. Thank you.

11:44.036 --> 11:44.954
Just doing my job.

11:47.957 --> 11:48.833
Oh, boy.

11:49.834 --> 11:50.668
All right.

11:59.927 --> 12:01.303
(telephone rings)

12:02.138 --> 12:02.972
What?

12:04.515 --> 12:05.433
Hi, Ma.

12:07.643 --> 12:08.936
I'm fine. How are you?

12:10.354 --> 12:11.188
No, I'm not.

12:12.398 --> 12:14.150
Ma, I'm not in a bad mood.

12:15.234 --> 12:17.236
I'm not hiding anything from you.

12:18.279 --> 12:19.697
Because there's nothing wrong!

12:22.032 --> 12:24.910
Okay, maybe I got a little toothache.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.205
Because I didn't want to worry you.

12:31.083 --> 12:34.837
I'm going this afternoon.
I already made the appointment.

12:37.715 --> 12:39.508
Could we please change the subject?

12:40.134 --> 12:40.968
Thank you.

12:41.802 --> 12:43.012
So what's new with you?

12:45.639 --> 12:46.599
Why? What's wrong?

12:49.852 --> 12:51.520
All right, all right, wait a minute.

12:51.604 --> 12:52.938
Who's getting the divorce?

12:54.607 --> 12:55.858
Joe and Sandra.

12:57.193 --> 12:59.862
Oh, the Clayburn's.

12:59.945 --> 13:00.946
That's too bad.

13:02.406 --> 13:05.284
I am upset, Ma, but, you know,
those things happen.

13:07.787 --> 13:09.747
Wait a minute. You told me yourself

13:09.830 --> 13:12.082
that she was cheating on him
with her foot doctor,

13:12.166 --> 13:14.668
so maybe-- Listen to me.

13:15.461 --> 13:18.130
Maybe he's better off without her.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.510
Maybe he'll find someone else.

13:22.593 --> 13:25.346
I don't know, Ma! Maybe somebody at work.

13:26.347 --> 13:28.599
All right, then, maybe somebody
on the bus on his way to work,

13:28.682 --> 13:32.019
I don't know, but I really don't think
you should let it upset you this much.

13:33.229 --> 13:35.231
Because it's not healthy.

13:37.733 --> 13:39.318
There is something you can do about it.

13:39.401 --> 13:42.112
Yes, there is, Ma. Change the channel.

13:43.155 --> 13:44.156
That's right.

13:44.824 --> 13:45.658
Bye.

13:48.953 --> 13:51.747
He gives me the money. I am making change.

13:52.373 --> 13:54.291
Then he takes out the knife very fast,

13:54.625 --> 13:56.335
and he places it to me here.

14:00.923 --> 14:02.591
Mr. Chabundi...

14:03.050 --> 14:04.677
(grunts)

14:04.760 --> 14:05.719
(sighs)

14:07.763 --> 14:09.390
-Is it--
-Would you like this?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.183
Thank you.

14:12.142 --> 14:14.478
Is it possible, uh, Mr. Chabundi,

14:14.562 --> 14:16.605
you could've been mistaken
about the knife?

14:17.147 --> 14:18.983
Maybe he had something
that looked like a knife.

14:19.066 --> 14:21.277
No, it was a knife. I saw it.

14:21.735 --> 14:23.612
It was very long with a blue handle.

14:26.031 --> 14:28.284
Ah... Do you have any idea
what happened to it?

14:29.618 --> 14:30.452
I do not know.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.162
He was walking around.

14:33.539 --> 14:34.874
Maybe he hide it?

14:34.957 --> 14:37.209
He was walking around after you shot him?

14:37.960 --> 14:38.836
Yes, after.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.257
You're not going to undress more, are you?

14:44.091 --> 14:45.467
(sighs) I'm not sure.

14:47.928 --> 14:50.180
No, I was... joking.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.850
Miss Davenport, I am a student.

14:53.517 --> 14:55.769
I would never hurt anyone with no reason.

14:56.562 --> 14:58.981
But in six months
I have worked as a cab driver,

14:59.064 --> 15:00.733
this makes five times I am robbed.

15:00.816 --> 15:03.027
Just the same,
you shouldn't have had the gun.

15:03.777 --> 15:06.405
Cab drivers aren't allowed
to carry firearms in the city.

15:06.488 --> 15:08.115
I am only trying to defend myself.

15:08.198 --> 15:09.658
How can I go to jail for that?

15:10.284 --> 15:11.911
No one said anything about jail.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.997
You have no prior arrests
and your college standing is excellent.

15:16.957 --> 15:18.167
But what about immigration?

15:19.376 --> 15:21.837
Miss Davenport,
I worked so hard to come here.

15:22.838 --> 15:26.508
If I go back like this,
I will be a disgrace.

15:28.469 --> 15:30.596
Listen, let's just take it
one step at a time.

15:31.388 --> 15:33.140
I'm sure we can find a way to work it out.

15:34.642 --> 15:35.559
I mean that.

15:36.936 --> 15:37.770
Thank you.

15:38.312 --> 15:40.731
(sighs) Miss Davenport,
thank you very much.

15:41.774 --> 15:44.944
I'm telling you, man,
I feel like I could bathe for a week.

15:46.195 --> 15:47.404
Doctors think they might
have a good chance

15:47.488 --> 15:48.822
of sewing the dude's arm
back on again, man.

15:48.906 --> 15:49.782
Hey.

15:49.865 --> 15:51.825
-Louie, sorry.
-Stopped for an accident.

15:51.909 --> 15:53.118
You sure your grandma wasn't sick?

15:53.202 --> 15:54.745
Oh, yeah, all over my shirt.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.872
-Morning, fellas.
-Here's his schedule.

15:57.957 --> 15:59.416
I'll be out of here in another half-hour.

15:59.500 --> 16:00.918
-Anyone want work as a speech writer?
-He's scheduled to be back

16:01.001 --> 16:03.128
around 2:00 for a tenants
committee meeting.

16:03.212 --> 16:05.047
-Whoa! Hey!
-Hey, no sell, Hector.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.049
Man, I thought this dude
wanted to talk to his people.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.258
Okay, but not today.

16:08.968 --> 16:10.386
Well, I got some things I want to say.

16:10.469 --> 16:11.428
Let him in, please.

16:11.929 --> 16:12.930
All right, spread 'em, Hector.

16:13.013 --> 16:14.807
Hey! Hey, come on, cut it out, will ya?

16:14.890 --> 16:16.308
I won't have you treating
these people like thugs!

16:16.392 --> 16:18.394
-Now let him in.
-This is bright! This is real great!

16:18.686 --> 16:20.813
-What's your name, son?
-Hector-- Hector Ruiz.

16:20.896 --> 16:22.898
-Hey, Mr. Fisk, you don't have to--
-Ben Fisk. Pleased to meet you.

16:22.982 --> 16:24.858
Yeah, pleased to meet you, sucker!
Come on, man.

16:25.234 --> 16:27.277
Now who got the power, pigs?
Who got the power?

16:27.361 --> 16:29.613
Move, man! Move or I'm gonna kill him!

16:29.989 --> 16:31.115
-All right. All right, Hector--
-Come on, move!

16:31.198 --> 16:32.700
-Easy.
-Yeah, we moving, baby. We're moving.

16:32.783 --> 16:36.203
Get out. Get out the way.
Now you're gonna listen to me, mister,

16:36.495 --> 16:38.789
and you're gonna listen
real good, you got that?

16:42.668 --> 16:43.627
Get Howard in here, please,

16:43.711 --> 16:45.337
and we need a phone hookup
to that apartment.

16:45.421 --> 16:46.839
That's number-one priority.

16:46.922 --> 16:49.258
-Right away.
-Do you want to go along on this one?

16:49.341 --> 16:50.217
Why wouldn't I?

16:50.300 --> 16:51.760
You could stay here
and point your finger at me.

16:51.844 --> 16:55.806
I understand young Ruiz
has taken our crusader hostage, Frank.

16:55.889 --> 16:57.182
How long to get your men in place?

16:57.558 --> 16:58.726
Full deployment in 30 minutes.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.643
Go. Go ahead.

17:03.105 --> 17:06.859
-You want me out there, Frank?
-Yes. Keep me posted.

17:07.109 --> 17:08.569
I will. That's how I work.

17:11.613 --> 17:16.118
(siren wailing)

17:18.037 --> 17:21.165
(helicopter whirring)

17:21.457 --> 17:22.708
HENRY:
It's gonna be Barnum &amp; Bailey out here.

17:22.791 --> 17:25.169
I'm gonna need at least six more units
on crowd control.

17:26.795 --> 17:27.880
Pick up the phone, Hector.

17:28.213 --> 17:30.883
We want to be able to talk to you.
We want to hear what you have to say.

17:31.759 --> 17:34.178
That glare's gonna have us
at bay till midafternoon, Henry.

17:34.261 --> 17:35.804
-Say again?
-The sun.

17:35.888 --> 17:37.806
It's right in the apartment windows here.

17:38.432 --> 17:39.933
We won't have a shot
for at least two hours.

17:40.017 --> 17:40.976
Break my heart.

17:41.977 --> 17:43.687
That wasn't advocacy, Lieutenant.

17:43.771 --> 17:46.982
I was merely acquainting you
with a range of possible response.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.276
Right. Thanks.

17:49.777 --> 17:51.737
I'm sure once you ask nicely,

17:51.820 --> 17:54.281
the little urchin
will tell us "April fools,"

17:54.823 --> 17:57.159
and cartwheel right into the paddy wagon.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.411
-Howard. Where is he?
-Chief.

17:59.495 --> 18:01.205
Right up there. Second room. Four up.

18:01.580 --> 18:02.414
-Status.
-Hec--

18:03.123 --> 18:04.875
I'm trying to establish
phone communication.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.126
Is Fisk all right?

18:06.210 --> 18:07.252
I'm trying to find out!

18:07.336 --> 18:08.587
Find out how Fisk is.

18:08.670 --> 18:10.464
-Excuse me.
-Bingo, Henry.

18:13.133 --> 18:13.967
Hector?

18:14.843 --> 18:15.677
Good.

18:16.929 --> 18:19.223
Slow. We got a lot of time.

18:19.932 --> 18:21.850
Just let me make sure
everybody's all right. You okay?

18:22.893 --> 18:23.811
Mr. Fisk?

18:25.687 --> 18:26.522
Great.

18:27.231 --> 18:28.982
Great, then we're gonna work
this one out, Hector.

18:29.608 --> 18:31.443
Everyone's gonna come out
of this all right.

18:31.527 --> 18:33.070
What's he telling him,
he's done a great thing?

18:33.153 --> 18:34.321
We're gonna put him up for a medal?

18:34.404 --> 18:35.781
He's trying to calm the guy down.

18:35.864 --> 18:37.741
I think you have contributed
enough today, Detective.

18:37.825 --> 18:39.910
-You've been negligent enough.
-Easy, Dennis. Easy.

18:40.994 --> 18:44.748
Lieutenant, this is Andrew Lane,
Ben Fisk's campaign manager.

18:44.832 --> 18:47.251
I want him kept informed
of all developments.

18:47.876 --> 18:48.752
Anything we can do?

18:49.211 --> 18:51.421
-Give us room to work.
-Absolutely. Absolutely.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.799
The lieutenant is one of our very best men

18:53.882 --> 18:55.175
-in hostage negotiations.
-Hector.

18:56.927 --> 18:58.387
Hey, I didn't go anyplace.

18:58.470 --> 18:59.721
Just got everybody
and his mother out here.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.140
You got the whole city paying attention.

19:01.223 --> 19:02.307
Everybody's yapping in my ear.

19:05.602 --> 19:08.647
Hey, wait, wait,
before we get to an agenda, let's, uh--

19:09.439 --> 19:11.066
Are you hungry? You want something to eat?

19:13.235 --> 19:14.069
Okay, wait.

19:14.736 --> 19:16.655
Hector, wait, if you want,
we'll do it now.

19:17.781 --> 19:19.158
Fine. Whatever.

19:19.741 --> 19:20.576
What's going on?

19:22.411 --> 19:24.705
No more crap from you, Henry,
you got that?

19:24.788 --> 19:26.331
No more lies, man!

19:26.790 --> 19:28.584
You put Jesus away!

19:29.293 --> 19:33.005
You get me a million bucks,
and you put this stuff on cameras, now!

19:33.338 --> 19:37.426
And you put Jesus Martinez in jail,
or this guy is gonna die!

19:37.509 --> 19:40.220
MAN (over radio): <i>The candidate</i>
<i>is being held hostage by Hector Ruiz,</i>

19:40.304 --> 19:42.514
<i>leader of a gang faction</i>
<i>in the Hill district.</i>

19:42.931 --> 19:46.268
<i>As ransom for the candidate's release,</i>
<i>Ruiz is demanding</i>

19:46.351 --> 19:49.021
<i>immediate reincarceration</i>
<i>of Jesus Martinez...</i>

19:49.104 --> 19:49.938
Frank?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.441
<i>...recently paroled on</i>
<i>an embezzlement conviction.</i>

19:52.524 --> 19:53.942
Yeah, hello? Yeah?

19:54.860 --> 19:56.612
Yeah, we're gonna pick up Jesus.

19:56.695 --> 19:57.946
Can I promise him that?

19:58.030 --> 20:00.616
Ray's working up a list
of all of his hangouts right now.

20:00.699 --> 20:01.867
We send Jesus back?

20:01.950 --> 20:03.535
You know I can't do that
without cause, Henry.

20:03.619 --> 20:05.787
Do we know who his parole officer is?

20:05.871 --> 20:06.997
He doesn't have one.

20:07.289 --> 20:10.459
Great. You're gonna have
some blood down here, Frank.

20:10.542 --> 20:13.545
Well, if that's the case, Henry,
I don't want it to be Fisk's.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.506
Is there any way Jesus
could agree to some sort of cosmetic--

20:16.590 --> 20:18.258
Look, we're just gonna bring him in
and see what we can get.

20:18.342 --> 20:19.468
What does the rest look like?

20:21.011 --> 20:21.845
A zoo.

20:22.721 --> 20:24.514
It's okay. I'll be in touch.

20:27.768 --> 20:30.812
Phil, tell Ray to use anyone available--

20:30.896 --> 20:32.105
all of Jesus' hangouts.

20:32.189 --> 20:34.983
-Should we get a warrant?
-He's material to a police investigation.

20:37.986 --> 20:39.988
Sarge. Captain, did you want to see me?

20:40.906 --> 20:41.907
Close it.

20:46.203 --> 20:47.788
John Fox came to see me today.

20:47.871 --> 20:49.665
He's, uh, Midtown Vice.

20:50.207 --> 20:52.000
He was all set to take
a crap game last night

20:52.084 --> 20:54.253
when he recognized you at the table.
He deferred the bust.

20:54.336 --> 20:56.755
What's the damage? Is he going to IAD?

20:56.838 --> 20:59.341
Not at present,
but there'll be no more warnings.

21:00.133 --> 21:01.301
Captain, if--

21:01.385 --> 21:03.553
Look, I know you're under
a lot of pressure.

21:03.637 --> 21:05.347
Something like this lottery
can be a mixed blessing.

21:05.430 --> 21:07.975
It's none of my business
what you do with your money, Bobby,

21:08.058 --> 21:09.643
but I'm not going to let you
compromise the badge.

21:09.726 --> 21:12.354
-Am I understood?
-Yes, sir.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.689
Get back to work.

21:14.439 --> 21:16.858
Check with Lieutenant Calletano
in bringing in Martinez.

21:23.031 --> 21:25.784
Andrew, El Cajón social club,
511 East Utica.

21:25.867 --> 21:27.327
-Right.
-Backrooms, too.

21:27.411 --> 21:29.288
-Yes, sir.
-Bobby, you got a minute?

21:29.371 --> 21:30.372
-I need--
-What is it, Belker?

21:30.455 --> 21:31.915
What do you need? You need a little help?

21:32.291 --> 21:33.750
Here, take it. It's all yours.

21:33.834 --> 21:35.210
Just get out of my face.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.004
Oh, you want more? How about this?

21:37.087 --> 21:39.214
I don't want your lousy money, nosebleed!

21:41.258 --> 21:44.553
I was gonna work up a field report for you
on that mud palace bust,

21:44.636 --> 21:47.639
but don't bother getting it,
because I just changed my mind!

21:48.515 --> 21:49.641
What's the story on you, man?

21:49.725 --> 21:50.600
Just leave it!

21:52.227 --> 21:53.061
Leave it.

22:03.613 --> 22:04.906
So, where'd you go last night?

22:05.741 --> 22:06.575
Went out.

22:07.284 --> 22:08.118
Yeah, I know you went out.

22:08.201 --> 22:10.120
You breezed by me like the Topeka Express

22:10.203 --> 22:11.038
on your way out of the squad room.

22:11.121 --> 22:12.748
I tried to call you till 1:00 am
in the morning.

22:12.831 --> 22:14.249
I finally gave up and went to sleep.

22:14.333 --> 22:16.585
Thought maybe you might want
to party down with your pal

22:16.668 --> 22:18.003
after winning all that money.

22:20.422 --> 22:21.256
What is that?

22:21.798 --> 22:23.425
Currency, 2,500 bucks. It's yours.

22:23.508 --> 22:25.052
Uh-uh. No, sir. It's not.

22:26.511 --> 22:27.346
Why?

22:29.389 --> 22:30.891
I don't want no conscience money.

22:31.933 --> 22:36.438
Renko, I been going through
a lot of changes lately. (sighs)

22:36.521 --> 22:38.148
I'm a little turned around.

22:38.231 --> 22:41.109
Don't make me do a song.
I want you to have it.

22:42.903 --> 22:43.779
You really mean that?

22:44.321 --> 22:45.155
Yep.

22:46.114 --> 22:47.282
Because we're buddies, right?

22:48.825 --> 22:49.659
Right.

22:50.077 --> 22:52.829
Well, in that case, I accept,
with a great deal of pleasure.

22:52.913 --> 22:54.581
-Thank you, Robert.
-You're welcome.

22:54.664 --> 22:55.707
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

22:56.458 --> 23:00.087
Well, that certainly puts a new light
on the day, now, don't it?

23:00.170 --> 23:01.463
Yes, it does.

23:23.485 --> 23:26.780
(dance music playing)

23:32.411 --> 23:34.454
Hey, man, this is a private club.

23:34.538 --> 23:36.248
I didn't hear nobody invite you in.

23:54.891 --> 23:56.017
What's behind this door here?

23:56.101 --> 23:57.269
Your mama's bedroom.

24:05.193 --> 24:08.447
Boy, you gonna come over here
and help me open up this door?

24:08.738 --> 24:09.948
You got a warrant for this?

24:10.449 --> 24:13.285
Yeah, I got a warrant right here.

24:13.994 --> 24:15.579
Are you gonna come help me
open up this door,

24:15.662 --> 24:17.372
or am I gonna serve it to you personally?

24:17.789 --> 24:18.623
I'm busy.

24:22.961 --> 24:24.296
Renko, look out!

24:27.883 --> 24:29.634
(man shouting in Spanish)

24:31.094 --> 24:32.179
Look out for the knife!

24:32.721 --> 24:33.555
Aah!

24:36.391 --> 24:38.143
Hold it right there! Drop the knife!

24:38.226 --> 24:39.227
I said drop it!

24:39.769 --> 24:41.897
You don't drop that knife
by the time I count to three,

24:42.314 --> 24:43.315
I'm gonna blow your head off.

24:44.357 --> 24:45.233
One...

24:46.276 --> 24:47.110
two...

24:47.944 --> 24:48.778
three.

24:51.156 --> 24:51.990
Get off me!

24:53.283 --> 24:55.452
Get up against that bar right now, man!

24:55.535 --> 24:56.495
Get up against that bar.

24:56.870 --> 24:58.079
Get up against that bar, boy.

25:00.707 --> 25:02.000
You're the man, Bobby Hill.

25:02.083 --> 25:03.752
You're the man I want on my side.

25:03.835 --> 25:06.129
-Always-- Bobby Hill.
-Just go get cleaned up.

25:06.213 --> 25:07.214
All right, straight ahead.

25:08.215 --> 25:09.591
(woman speaking Spanish)

25:22.145 --> 25:25.690
Twenty-two bucks for a new shirt
every week of my life.

25:33.740 --> 25:34.658
Oh, mama...

25:35.784 --> 25:36.701
Oh, mama.

26:06.356 --> 26:07.315
Where's my money?

26:11.152 --> 26:12.612
All right, fellas, like the lady says,

26:12.696 --> 26:15.323
we can play it smooth,
or we can play it rough.

26:15.615 --> 26:17.659
But I want some results,
and I want 'em now.

26:17.742 --> 26:18.994
Now, where's my money?

26:19.077 --> 26:22.080
(both speaking Spanish)

26:22.163 --> 26:23.331
-Get up against that bar.
<i>-Por qué?</i>

26:23.415 --> 26:25.917
<i>Por qué</i> I said so.
Get up against that bar right now.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.502
Put your hands on that bar right now!

26:27.586 --> 26:30.297
(speaking Spanish)

26:30.380 --> 26:31.381
<i>Por qué?</i>

26:33.216 --> 26:35.510
Is that your dinero, huh?
Is that your dinero there?

26:35.594 --> 26:38.054
Where's mine, huh? Where's mine, huh?

26:38.138 --> 26:38.972
<i>Señor...</i>

26:40.724 --> 26:42.767
You want to say something?
I want my money!

26:42.851 --> 26:44.144
<i>No sé! No hablo inglés!</i>

26:44.227 --> 26:46.980
I want my money! <i>Mi dinero! Comprende?!</i>

26:47.063 --> 26:48.565
(shouting in Spanish)

26:48.648 --> 26:50.400
In a pig's eye, man.

27:07.250 --> 27:09.711
(moans)

27:20.013 --> 27:23.558
Preliminary hearing,
noon tomorrow on the charges

27:23.642 --> 27:26.061
of illegal possession
of a weapon and attempted murder.

27:26.144 --> 27:28.104
No! I am not guilty! It is the other one!

27:28.855 --> 27:30.815
-JUDGE: Miss Davenport...
-Uh, Your Honor, I'm sorry.

27:30.899 --> 27:33.818
My client's been extremely overwrought
ever since the incident.

27:33.902 --> 27:35.236
No, I am not a guilty man!

27:36.196 --> 27:39.324
Mr. Chabundi, this court will begin
to address that question tomorrow.

27:39.783 --> 27:42.118
In the meantime, you're free
to go on your own recognizance,

27:43.078 --> 27:45.163
and immigration will be notified.

27:45.246 --> 27:46.414
What?

27:46.873 --> 27:49.417
Oh, Miss Davenport, please,
you can't let them send me back!

27:49.709 --> 27:51.169
JUDGE: No one's sending you back, son.

27:51.252 --> 27:53.630
It's standard procedure
when felony charges are brought.

27:54.381 --> 27:56.049
I will prove to you there was a knife.

27:56.132 --> 27:57.300
I will go find it.

27:57.550 --> 27:59.260
-(bangs gavel)
-JUDGE: Next case.

28:00.011 --> 28:01.888
Please... You'll come with me. Can you?

28:01.971 --> 28:03.056
We will find it together.

28:03.348 --> 28:05.350
Kiki, I'm sorry. I can't this afternoon.

28:05.433 --> 28:06.518
I have to find it.

28:06.976 --> 28:08.478
I have three more clients.

28:08.937 --> 28:11.147
Officers, I know your time
is short, but if you--

28:11.231 --> 28:13.608
We looked once, Miss Davenport. I'm sorry.

28:14.192 --> 28:15.402
Couldn't they look some more?

28:16.653 --> 28:19.614
Kiki, later in the week,
I can get one of our office's--

28:19.698 --> 28:22.033
After the hearing?
After immigration is told?

28:22.117 --> 28:23.576
I'm afraid that's the earliest.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.869
Here's my home phone.

28:25.578 --> 28:27.038
You're not alone in this, honestly.

28:28.373 --> 28:30.625
(sighs) Try to stay calm.
Even if there's no knife--

28:30.709 --> 28:31.710
You don't believe me.

28:31.793 --> 28:34.754
Yes, I do. I'm simply saying
even if it's not found, we'll win this.

28:34.838 --> 28:36.756
I'll try very hard. See you tomorrow.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.972
(horn blares)

28:57.694 --> 28:58.945
Excuse me. You got the time?

28:59.988 --> 29:00.822
No.

29:01.197 --> 29:02.657
What do you figure it is, about noon?

29:03.116 --> 29:04.325
I said I don't know.

29:04.409 --> 29:05.368
(chuckles)

29:05.910 --> 29:07.328
How come you're eatin'
your lunch out here?

29:07.412 --> 29:08.663
What, are you writin' a book?

29:08.747 --> 29:10.498
(bell rings)

29:15.503 --> 29:17.005
(both grunting)

29:18.006 --> 29:19.007
Aah!

29:23.428 --> 29:25.597
(growling)

29:27.265 --> 29:28.725
(both straining)

29:30.518 --> 29:31.478
Aah!

29:49.162 --> 29:50.330
(growling)

29:50.413 --> 29:51.247
Aah!

29:57.545 --> 29:58.379
Get up!

29:58.671 --> 29:59.881
Get up!

30:04.135 --> 30:06.054
(siren wailing)

30:08.807 --> 30:11.392
You are under arrest, hair bag!

30:12.060 --> 30:14.312
We've looked all over for him, Hector.
We're still looking.

30:14.395 --> 30:17.148
He's out there, man. I know he is.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.817
He didn't go back to Puerto Rico.

30:19.359 --> 30:23.154
Check his mother's house,
Rosalita's, or El Cajón!

30:23.905 --> 30:26.407
We are within millimeters of being clear.

30:26.491 --> 30:27.325
Shut up.

30:28.743 --> 30:29.911
Hector, get away from the damn window.

30:29.994 --> 30:31.371
Use the damn phone.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.958
You are a phenomenon to me, Henry.

30:35.041 --> 30:36.626
You are an enigma.

30:36.709 --> 30:38.920
You want millimeters, Howard?
You're thinking William Tell?

30:39.003 --> 30:41.130
Was he clear? Did I hear
that you've got a clear shot at that kid?

30:41.214 --> 30:42.090
No, that's not what you heard.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.634
What I was saying is there are
instances as he turns--

30:44.717 --> 30:47.303
And you've also said that
your sight's obscured by the sun.

30:47.387 --> 30:49.264
What's going on here, please?

30:49.347 --> 30:52.183
Look, we've got a lot of cards
left to play before we get to guns.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.186
And the last thing that I want
to do is interfere.

30:56.312 --> 30:57.146
Hector?

30:57.689 --> 30:58.523
Hey, Hector?

30:58.606 --> 31:00.275
Uh... listen, I'll get back to you
in a second, okay?

31:02.151 --> 31:04.988
Look, would you please
get the hell away from me?

31:05.530 --> 31:08.199
Every time I start to get some continuity,
someone's watering my ear.

31:08.283 --> 31:10.577
Look here. I expect to be consulted
before any decisions made--

31:10.660 --> 31:12.370
You'll be consulted. You'll be consulted.

31:12.453 --> 31:13.329
For cryin' out loud,

31:13.413 --> 31:15.623
you're all going to confirm
your worst scenarios.

31:17.458 --> 31:18.626
Hector?

31:19.836 --> 31:20.879
Yeah. Okay.

31:22.547 --> 31:25.091
(helicopter whirring)

31:25.174 --> 31:26.134
Where is your captain?

31:26.384 --> 31:28.636
Well, you know policy, chief,
too many in command--

31:28.720 --> 31:30.889
I know what the damn policy is, Ray.

31:30.972 --> 31:32.682
I also know as long as the chief is here,

31:32.765 --> 31:34.267
it's hardly going to make things top-heavy

31:34.350 --> 31:35.393
for the captain to make an appearance.

31:35.476 --> 31:36.477
He sounds like he's losing it.

31:36.561 --> 31:38.980
You're saying that the man running
these negotiations is unstable?

31:39.063 --> 31:41.566
No, no, no, we're not.
We certainly are not, but I do think--

31:41.649 --> 31:43.902
Henry's in constant communication
with Captain Furillo.

31:43.985 --> 31:45.069
That's exactly the point.

31:45.153 --> 31:48.239
And I think, let's make sure
that we're getting Frank's input.

31:48.615 --> 31:49.449
Lieutenant?

31:50.533 --> 31:51.367
Hang on, Hector.

31:51.701 --> 31:52.535
What?

31:52.911 --> 31:53.912
Now, just calm down.

31:53.995 --> 31:55.580
Put me on your phone with your captain.

32:06.507 --> 32:08.051
He's not on. Oh, Frank?

32:08.718 --> 32:09.552
Listen to me, Frank.

32:09.969 --> 32:11.346
I'm in a situation here

32:11.721 --> 32:14.098
where every action I take
looks like bad faith.

32:14.474 --> 32:16.809
I'm trying to stay out
of substantive decision.

32:16.893 --> 32:19.062
That's why I didn't insist
you come down to begin with.

32:19.145 --> 32:20.855
But now I am insisting it.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.774
It looks like you can't scare up Martinez.

32:23.232 --> 32:24.275
We're still looking.

32:24.567 --> 32:27.654
The million dollars and meeting
the Queen of Sheba aside, Frank,

32:27.737 --> 32:29.489
putting Martinez back in jail seemed to be

32:29.572 --> 32:32.533
what this kid was after,
and that isn't going to happen,

32:33.034 --> 32:35.536
which means we're about to close
with some unpleasant decisions.

32:35.620 --> 32:37.121
You cannot give the kill order.

32:38.164 --> 32:40.625
I want you to make the call
on how we proceed, Frank.

32:41.125 --> 32:42.210
It's not right for me to do it.

32:42.877 --> 32:43.711
I agree.

32:43.795 --> 32:44.879
Will you get down here?

32:45.755 --> 32:46.798
Tell Henry I'm on the way.

32:51.344 --> 32:53.805
What are you lookin' at?
Don't look at me, screw!

32:54.222 --> 32:56.140
Mick, what's going on here?

32:56.224 --> 32:59.936
(sighs) I'm sorry, Captain.
I just sort of stumbled into it.

33:00.019 --> 33:01.187
You were supposed to be out
getting sandwiches.

33:01.270 --> 33:02.146
You're on desk duty.

33:02.480 --> 33:03.856
Well, I'm still a cop, aren't I?

33:03.940 --> 33:05.274
Not once you've turned in your shield.

33:06.943 --> 33:08.611
Okay, I was making a citizen's arrest.

33:08.695 --> 33:10.029
Whose side are you on, anyway?

33:10.905 --> 33:11.948
We'll discuss this later, Mick.

33:12.031 --> 33:14.492
I don't want you moving
from that desk till I get back, okay?

33:14.575 --> 33:17.412
Leo... Do you want to do
Detective Belker's paperwork here, please?

33:18.079 --> 33:18.913
Okay, Captain.

33:19.622 --> 33:20.748
(growling)

33:20.832 --> 33:24.085
(horn honking)

33:25.878 --> 33:26.713
Keep it clear.

33:35.888 --> 33:37.682
-FLETCHER: Frank.
-Any change?

33:37.765 --> 33:39.434
Oh, he keeps dragging Fisk to the window.

33:39.517 --> 33:42.770
He's got 57 different ways
of demanding we pop Martinez.

33:43.187 --> 33:44.647
-Sun's cleared the building.
-Yep.

33:45.106 --> 33:46.357
Have we got a consensus?

33:46.858 --> 33:47.859
Run it down for me.

33:47.942 --> 33:49.068
I'd call it stable.

33:49.360 --> 33:51.362
His demands have remained
essentially the same.

33:51.446 --> 33:53.781
No increment in violence
since first presentation.

33:53.865 --> 33:55.199
Why don't you stow the gobbledygook?

33:55.283 --> 33:56.117
Get away.

33:56.784 --> 33:57.869
I think you should too, Chief.

33:57.952 --> 33:59.328
I agree. I agree absolutely.

33:59.412 --> 34:02.248
But, Frank, let's close with realities.

34:07.128 --> 34:08.463
Is Hector waiting to hear from you?

34:08.963 --> 34:11.257
I told him you were coming,
I had to talk to you.

34:11.924 --> 34:13.217
Told him you'd have news about Jesus.

34:13.301 --> 34:14.343
That's a dead issue.

34:15.094 --> 34:17.430
Jesus was probably listening on the radio,
knew we were coming.

34:18.014 --> 34:19.223
Which leaves us where?

34:19.724 --> 34:22.018
I don't know where it leaves us.
I know where it leaves Hector.

34:23.561 --> 34:24.979
I don't see an alternative.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.441
He cocked the gun last time.

34:28.524 --> 34:29.817
I thought he was gonna waste him.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.030
I am simply offering information here,

34:34.113 --> 34:35.573
the sun has cleared the windows.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.701
You've got him inside the apartment?

34:38.785 --> 34:39.619
Yes.

34:41.537 --> 34:42.371
Let's take him.

34:42.830 --> 34:45.416
I need him stable. I need him still.

34:53.174 --> 34:54.008
Hector?

34:55.885 --> 34:57.762
Okay. We got word on Jesus.

34:57.845 --> 34:59.055
I think we can bring him in.

35:00.515 --> 35:03.267
But now, Hector,
I want you to stop a minute.

35:04.560 --> 35:05.645
I want you to stop...

35:06.813 --> 35:09.941
And think about what
you want out of all this.

35:10.358 --> 35:12.068
He's still, Frank. He's sighted.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.490
-Go. Take him.
-Fire.

35:18.074 --> 35:20.076
(gunshot)

35:26.499 --> 35:27.500
Are we clear?

35:27.583 --> 35:28.417
MAN: All clear.

35:29.502 --> 35:30.336
We're clear.

35:30.920 --> 35:32.797
Am I all right? Am I all right?

35:32.880 --> 35:33.965
You're okay.

35:34.674 --> 35:36.175
Everything's okay.

35:37.093 --> 35:41.472
Oh... Oh, my God.
His brains are all over me.

35:44.433 --> 35:45.268
What...

35:46.769 --> 35:48.229
What-what happened here?

35:48.688 --> 35:50.189
What-what the hell happened here?

35:50.565 --> 35:51.399
What happened?

35:51.482 --> 35:53.401
Just take it easy. Take it easy.
Are you all right?

35:53.484 --> 35:54.318
My God...

35:55.570 --> 35:57.697
He exploded right into my face.

35:59.574 --> 36:00.992
Easy. Come on.

36:01.075 --> 36:02.243
Stupid bastard.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.121
Visit other people's lives.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.500
We'll get you cleaned up. Huh? Huh?

36:10.334 --> 36:11.169
Yeah.

36:11.961 --> 36:15.089
(siren wailing)

36:28.561 --> 36:29.854
People, we all know how to do this.

36:29.937 --> 36:32.565
I assure you,
when a statement is forthcoming,

36:32.648 --> 36:33.733
none of you will be deprived.

36:33.816 --> 36:35.526
-Please let the officer through.
-Did the kid have family?

36:35.610 --> 36:37.236
I believe Ruiz was an orphan.

36:37.486 --> 36:39.530
Hey, Officer, I understand you gents

36:39.614 --> 36:41.824
are having a little soiree this evening.

36:41.908 --> 36:42.742
Yes.

36:42.825 --> 36:45.411
Well, my girls are supposed
to meet with Joe after,

36:45.494 --> 36:47.788
which means they have
a little time on their hands.

36:47.872 --> 36:52.001
So, I'm thinking why not liven up
the festivities with a little exhibition?

36:52.251 --> 36:55.838
The girls could fool around a little,
put on coconut oil.

36:55.922 --> 36:59.050
You want to run a garden hose
on 'em, that's okay, too.

36:59.133 --> 37:00.760
And don't even worry about the money.

37:00.843 --> 37:03.804
If you want to pass the hat
around afterwards... whatever.

37:04.138 --> 37:06.974
But mostly, we consider it
a thank you present

37:07.058 --> 37:08.935
to your fine department.

37:09.018 --> 37:10.019
What do you say?

37:12.897 --> 37:14.398
Why don't you kill yourself?

37:15.441 --> 37:17.526
Frank, Frank-- from Jesus.

37:17.610 --> 37:20.238
He said he was out of town
all day on business.

37:20.321 --> 37:21.697
He just heard that we were
looking for him.

37:21.781 --> 37:23.324
-Thanks, Ray.
-Way to pull the plug on that kid, Frank.

37:23.407 --> 37:25.493
It took you six hours
to muscle up to the bar.

37:26.118 --> 37:26.953
What do you want?

37:28.287 --> 37:31.207
Belker, LaRue, Washington,
Renko, in there.

37:31.290 --> 37:32.124
Why?

37:32.667 --> 37:34.669
'Cause that's the captain's office, Frank.

37:34.752 --> 37:36.587
Most precincts, it's the place of command.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.009
I got a whole shopping bag here, people.

37:42.468 --> 37:46.639
I got a guy, supposed to be at his desk,
playing cowboys and Indians in the street.

37:47.348 --> 37:49.308
Of course, then you got your uniform here

37:49.392 --> 37:51.811
pulling your run-of-the-mill
roust on two citizens

37:51.894 --> 37:54.605
at the El Cajón,
trashing their establishment.

37:54.981 --> 37:58.693
And then we get a call
from two people who caught their act.

37:58.776 --> 38:00.945
-What act?
-What the hell do you suppose?

38:01.028 --> 38:03.239
"Takes a lickin' and keeps on tickin'."

38:04.073 --> 38:06.867
You pull a man's arm out of a gutter
and crack jokes about it.

38:06.951 --> 38:10.121
Captain, while he was busy
collecting reports,

38:10.204 --> 38:12.206
I wonder if he took the time
to call the hospital

38:12.290 --> 38:13.499
to see how the guy's doing.

38:13.916 --> 38:15.835
'Cause I called,
and thanks to J.D. and me,

38:15.918 --> 38:18.629
the guy's got a 60 percent shot
at using his arm again.

38:18.713 --> 38:20.464
Maybe nobody cares about that, huh?

38:20.548 --> 38:22.591
I just want to let you know, fellas,

38:22.925 --> 38:26.887
until this election, every day,
if I've got to, I'm gonna come up here

38:26.971 --> 38:28.431
and change your diapers.

38:28.514 --> 38:30.391
Twice a day, if I have to.

38:30.474 --> 38:32.393
(laughing)

38:33.311 --> 38:34.228
What's so funny?

38:36.314 --> 38:39.525
(laughs) Well, it's just this...
this arm business.

38:39.900 --> 38:41.527
It puts me in mind of an old joke.

38:42.611 --> 38:45.197
A guy's in a car wreck,
and his hand gets cut off.

38:45.281 --> 38:46.490
He picks it up, he runs over to a doctor.

38:46.574 --> 38:48.284
He says, "Doc, quick!
Can you sew this back on?"

38:48.367 --> 38:50.745
The doctor says,
"Sure, but it'll cost you $20,000."

38:50.828 --> 38:53.331
He says, "Gee, forget it."
He runs over to another doctor.

38:53.664 --> 38:55.207
He says,
"Doctor, can you sew this back on?"

38:55.291 --> 38:56.208
He says, "Yeah, sure."

38:56.292 --> 38:57.585
He says, "How much is that gonna be?"

38:57.668 --> 39:01.005
He says, "$250."
He says, "$250? Gee, do it!"

39:01.088 --> 39:04.300
Well, the doctor sews it on,
a few weeks later, the guy's hand is fine.

39:04.842 --> 39:07.928
He can move the fingers,
the feeling's coming back. It's just fine.

39:08.471 --> 39:11.557
Well, he's having the stitches taken out,
and he spots the first doctor.

39:11.640 --> 39:13.184
He runs right over to him, he says,

39:13.267 --> 39:14.352
"Hey, Doc, remember me?"

39:14.435 --> 39:16.354
He says, "Look at this.
Everything's just great."

39:16.437 --> 39:19.231
He says, "I went to another doctor,
and he did it for $250.

39:19.315 --> 39:21.025
When I came to you, you wanted 20,000.

39:21.108 --> 39:22.651
I have just one thing to say to you."

39:23.778 --> 39:26.280
(laughter)

39:32.161 --> 39:33.287
Reprimand.

39:33.954 --> 39:34.872
Reprimand.

39:36.707 --> 39:38.042
Suspension continued.

39:41.962 --> 39:43.005
Insubordination.

39:45.549 --> 39:47.468
(LaRue chuckles)

39:53.391 --> 39:57.645
(laughter)

40:01.273 --> 40:03.192
NEAL: The guy says,
"Hey, that's great! It's a deal!"

40:03.275 --> 40:05.444
So he sews it on, and everything
is working fine,

40:05.528 --> 40:07.071
and one day he runs into the first doctor.

40:07.154 --> 40:08.823
He says, "Hey, sucker!

40:09.073 --> 40:10.616
I just got one thing to say to you!"

40:11.617 --> 40:12.618
(laughter)

40:12.701 --> 40:14.787
I'll tell you one thing.
If a person's not meant to be lucky,

40:14.870 --> 40:17.081
he's not gonna be lucky.
That's all there is to it.

40:17.164 --> 40:20.292
You see, no matter how it is looks,
way a thing's gonna turn out,

40:20.376 --> 40:22.336
it ain't never gonna turn out
the way you want it to,

40:22.420 --> 40:23.587
'cause it don't happen that way.

40:23.671 --> 40:25.089
So don't never...

40:25.172 --> 40:26.590
(whistles) Everybody listen up.

40:26.924 --> 40:28.717
Neal, my man, I'm gonna tell you,

40:28.801 --> 40:30.719
you were something else out there today.

40:31.429 --> 40:32.513
Hey, you deserve a medal.

40:32.596 --> 40:33.514
Hey, thanks, J.D.

40:33.597 --> 40:35.141
I want to shake your hand.

40:35.224 --> 40:36.308
Hey, you got it, blood.

40:37.268 --> 40:40.396
(laughter)

40:43.315 --> 40:45.109
Hey, hey, he is the man.

40:45.192 --> 40:46.652
Hey, where are the Babing's, baby?

40:47.403 --> 40:50.948
-I'm meeting them later.
-Come on. I heard they left for ba-Boise.

40:51.031 --> 40:52.867
More like ba-Bangkok.

40:52.950 --> 40:55.035
JOE: You guys are a r-riot.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.204
Your attention, please!

40:58.289 --> 41:01.292
A surprise just for you wonderful people,

41:01.375 --> 41:05.379
right here on this stage, two pulsating,

41:05.463 --> 41:08.132
pulverizing princesses
of pugilistic pulchritude

41:08.674 --> 41:09.967
are going to provide for you

41:10.050 --> 41:11.886
what has previously been purveyed

41:11.969 --> 41:13.471
only for the privileged patrons

41:13.554 --> 41:16.056
of certain posh, private clubs.

41:16.724 --> 41:18.392
I give you the Babing sisters.

41:18.476 --> 41:20.561
If this is what's happening,
I'm out of here.

41:20.644 --> 41:22.062
It's not happening. Don't worry.

41:22.771 --> 41:26.525
...two perfectly matched specimens
of fleshy female fortitude.

41:26.609 --> 41:28.694
(applause)

41:29.987 --> 41:31.280
Uh, show's over, folks.

41:31.614 --> 41:32.531
Joe, what's going on?

41:32.615 --> 41:34.241
-We're doing it for--
-Forget about it. No way.

41:34.325 --> 41:36.118
Girls, look, why don't you go get dressed?

41:36.202 --> 41:38.537
Old Joe's gonna take you out.
We'll have a good time tonight.

41:40.873 --> 41:42.374
Joe, we're talkin' a lot of money here.

41:42.458 --> 41:43.417
Yeah, right. Right.

41:44.335 --> 41:47.004
Hey, Bobby! Where you been?

41:47.087 --> 41:48.214
An investment seminar.

41:48.297 --> 41:49.131
No kiddin'?

41:49.381 --> 41:50.257
You're smart.

41:50.925 --> 41:52.259
You, uh, learn anything good?

41:52.843 --> 41:53.677
Yeah.

41:54.220 --> 41:57.556
Listen, uh, Bobby, I apologize
for what I said this morning--

41:57.640 --> 41:59.433
-Yeah. Yeah, sure.
-I really appreciate your help.

42:01.602 --> 42:04.813
(laughter)

42:06.690 --> 42:07.858
-Michael?
-Yeah?

42:09.068 --> 42:11.028
What's the story on Bobby?
Did he say anything--

42:11.111 --> 42:13.614
I don't know. I was talking to him,
he walked over there.

42:13.697 --> 42:16.700
You know, I was gonna give you $20,
but I'm all tapped out.

42:16.784 --> 42:18.786
-Oh, no problem, Renko.
-I know that you're having problems.

42:18.869 --> 42:19.703
Thanks for the thought.

42:20.579 --> 42:22.790
Uh, excuse me. Excuse me.
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

42:22.873 --> 42:25.459
Uh, Bobby, I got to talk to you.

42:25.751 --> 42:26.794
-What's up?
-I got to talk to you.

42:26.877 --> 42:27.795
Just come over here.

42:30.548 --> 42:31.674
Now, I don't know where
to start with this,

42:31.757 --> 42:32.841
but it's no reflection on you.

42:32.925 --> 42:34.635
-It's nothing personal against you--
-What, Renko?

42:35.511 --> 42:36.845
-What?
-I lost the money.

42:36.929 --> 42:38.889
I had it in my pocket
and then we had that fight,

42:38.973 --> 42:39.932
and it fell out on ground.

42:40.015 --> 42:41.642
I went back to try to find it.
It's nowhere.

42:41.725 --> 42:44.228
I-I just thought maybe...
I owed it to you to tell you--

42:44.311 --> 42:45.980
Renko, look, look, look, look.

42:46.063 --> 42:49.191
Look! Easy come, easy go, easy come.

42:49.984 --> 42:51.402
I can't take this.

42:51.902 --> 42:53.028
Sure, you can!

42:53.654 --> 42:54.488
Sure, I can.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.532
Whoa!

42:57.199 --> 42:58.867
MAN: Joe, you're makin' a mistake.

42:58.951 --> 42:59.785
Hey, shut up.

42:59.868 --> 43:02.079
Never interfere with how people
make their living.

43:02.162 --> 43:05.249
BOBBY: How would you girls
like to make a living with me?

43:06.875 --> 43:09.461
-How about it?
-We're leaving.

43:09.545 --> 43:10.838
Yeah, they're leaving with me, Bobby.

43:11.880 --> 43:13.132
Well, let's see.

43:13.215 --> 43:14.049
Uh, one...

43:14.758 --> 43:19.221
A thousand says, uh, the girls
are changing their plans.

43:20.764 --> 43:22.057
What the hell are you doing, Bobby?

43:22.891 --> 43:23.851
-What am I doing, Bobby?
-Yeah.

43:23.934 --> 43:24.768
-Yeah.
-Hey, hey, Bobby.

43:26.103 --> 43:29.607
(laughing) A grand a sister.

43:31.191 --> 43:32.109
How about that?

43:41.201 --> 43:42.453
The hell with it. You do what you want.

43:45.497 --> 43:46.874
You know, maybe you should
invest some of that money

43:46.957 --> 43:48.125
with Dale Carnegie.

44:00.512 --> 44:01.347
You know...

44:03.057 --> 44:06.310
I wouldn't mind blowing
40 bucks on a dinner

44:07.061 --> 44:08.812
if you'd at least glanced at it.

44:08.896 --> 44:10.439
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.

44:10.731 --> 44:12.149
It was just one of those days.

44:13.901 --> 44:15.444
Can Mahoney make that stick?

44:15.527 --> 44:17.321
The insubordination? Probably not.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.157
Now ask me how much I care.

44:22.743 --> 44:26.288
How about if I give you
a nice lukewarm bubble bath

44:26.372 --> 44:27.831
with a backrub chaser?

44:27.915 --> 44:30.501
Mm. Might just do the trick.

44:30.584 --> 44:31.627
(laughs)

44:32.252 --> 44:35.297
You run the water, and I'll be right in.

44:40.052 --> 44:41.178
I'll be the guy in the tub.

44:45.641 --> 44:48.686
(tape rewinding)

44:53.899 --> 44:55.359
-(beep)
-CHABUNDI: <i>Miss Davenport...</i>

44:56.819 --> 44:58.195
<i>I have looked and looked.</i>

44:59.655 --> 45:01.156
<i>I cannot find the knife.</i>

45:01.782 --> 45:02.741
<i>You must help.</i>

45:03.992 --> 45:05.577
(voice breaking)
<i>I know they will send me back.</i>

45:05.661 --> 45:06.495
<i>Please!</i>

45:07.371 --> 45:09.164
<i>I have no one else to help me.</i>

45:10.833 --> 45:12.251
<i>I don't know what to do.</i>

45:14.503 --> 45:18.465
<i>I just don't know what to do... at all.</i>

45:19.550 --> 45:20.884
(sobs)

45:26.640 --> 45:28.684
Wouldn't you know?
I'm probably gonna have this baby

45:28.767 --> 45:30.602
during the hottest week of the year.

45:38.610 --> 45:40.279
Well... here we are,

45:40.821 --> 45:43.115
two full-fledged Lamaze scholars.

45:44.199 --> 45:47.327
Nothing left but the, uh... grand finale.

45:48.370 --> 45:49.580
I feel ready. Do you feel ready?

45:50.038 --> 45:50.873
Yep.

45:51.665 --> 45:53.333
I mean, I think we're gonna be fine,
don't you?

45:53.417 --> 45:54.251
Sure.

45:56.336 --> 45:57.171
You know, Henry...

45:58.046 --> 46:01.341
not a lot of guys would volunteer
to be a surrogate partner.

46:01.425 --> 46:03.093
I want you to know I'm very grateful.

46:03.177 --> 46:04.344
Forget it. No problem.

46:08.140 --> 46:11.101
Henry... you seem kind of distant tonight.

46:11.185 --> 46:12.102
Is anything wrong?

46:14.313 --> 46:15.731
(sighs)

46:18.192 --> 46:19.943
I'm sorry, Fay. It's not you.

46:20.819 --> 46:24.823
It's just... stuff, you know?

46:27.493 --> 46:28.327
Oh.

46:30.245 --> 46:32.039
Look, I don't mean to be evasive.
It's just...

46:33.749 --> 46:35.250
It's been a hell of a rotten day,

46:35.334 --> 46:38.337
on top of which I've been having
some personal problems at work.

46:39.338 --> 46:40.297
Anybody I know?

46:42.841 --> 46:44.092
(chuckles)

46:44.176 --> 46:45.010
Frank?

46:46.178 --> 46:47.721
Look, Fay, I don't want
to put you in the middle.

46:48.180 --> 46:49.097
(sighs)

46:49.181 --> 46:53.811
Henry, believe me, I, uh...
I know him better than most.

46:54.311 --> 46:58.524
(sighs) He's, uh...
he's been acting like...

46:58.607 --> 46:59.650
like he's in a bunker.

47:00.442 --> 47:01.568
Did a lot of damage.

47:04.488 --> 47:05.948
He does that sometimes.

47:06.949 --> 47:10.035
He-he takes too much on himself,
and then he...

47:10.661 --> 47:12.996
he forgets to trust
the people closest to him.

47:16.458 --> 47:17.292
Yeah.

47:18.418 --> 47:19.503
Well, anyway, I...

47:21.588 --> 47:23.841
I know I haven't been much
support for the night. I'm sorry.

47:25.175 --> 47:26.009
Henry...

47:26.677 --> 47:29.972
You have given me as much support
during these last three weeks

47:30.055 --> 47:32.182
as any man's ever given me
in my whole life.

47:33.642 --> 47:35.102
I'll always love you for it.

47:36.019 --> 47:37.104
(sighs)

47:58.750 --> 48:01.503
-Hell of a time for our first kiss.
-Fay, I'm sorry.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.089
No.

48:05.048 --> 48:07.801
No, it's... it's okay.

48:22.608 --> 48:25.611
(closing theme playing)
