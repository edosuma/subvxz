00:01.293 --> 00:02.749
CARTER: It wasjust
a normal day in Eureka.

00:02.878 --> 00:03.913
Day's not over yet.

00:04.171 --> 00:06.036
Yeah. Like that was
going to last.

00:06.381 --> 00:09.589
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.718 --> 00:11.333
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.470 --> 00:13.677
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the bridge device.

00:13.805 --> 00:15.090
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.224 --> 00:17.715
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:18.018 --> 00:19.724
Henry? Married.

00:19.895 --> 00:21.305
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:21.438 --> 00:23.053
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:23.524 --> 00:25.936
Kevin? Different,
much to Allison's surprise.

00:26.068 --> 00:27.854
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics,

00:27.986 --> 00:29.567
much to everyone's surprise.

00:29.696 --> 00:32.073
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:32.199 --> 00:34.485
but there's one crappy rule.

00:34.618 --> 00:36.233
We can't tell anyone.

00:36.495 --> 00:39.202
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:39.665 --> 00:43.032
And I finally kissed Allison,
63 years ago.

00:44.127 --> 00:45.253
Which complicated
things a bit

00:45.379 --> 00:46.915
When I found out
that Tess never left.

00:47.047 --> 00:49.333
TESS: Look at you,
handsome.

00:49.466 --> 00:51.297
Tess! You're
not in Australia.

00:51.426 --> 00:53.508
Um, yeah.
That would be true.

00:53.637 --> 00:55.002
ALLISON:
She's pretty amazing.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.962
Must be why you asked
her to move in with you.

00:57.808 --> 01:00.174
I spend a year realizing
we don't work as a couple.

01:00.310 --> 01:03.017
We break up, and she's here,
thinking that it's great.

01:04.106 --> 01:07.143
But that's Eureka for you.
Same town, big changes.

01:16.952 --> 01:18.692
Last item. NOLWEPs.
Where are we?

01:18.829 --> 01:20.160
On track, sir.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.034
You'll be really pleased
with the progress

01:23.166 --> 01:24.997
in that whole
NOLWEP area.

01:25.127 --> 01:26.992
Good, so I can
expect them
to be ready

01:27.129 --> 01:28.665
for field testing
by next month?

01:29.131 --> 01:30.371
I'll get back to you
on that, sir.

01:30.841 --> 01:32.377
Today, Dr. Fargo.
Today.

01:32.843 --> 01:35.209
Of course, sir.
Over and out.

01:37.139 --> 01:38.925
Sorry to interrupt.
Just wanted to
let you know

01:39.057 --> 01:40.467
l was running home
to see Jenna for a bit.

01:40.601 --> 01:41.556
What's a NOLWEP?
What?

01:41.685 --> 01:43.266
Calm down.
This job is hard.

01:43.395 --> 01:45.386
I can't tell Mansfield
I don't know what
he's talking about

01:45.522 --> 01:47.103
or he'll have me
fired or killed,

01:47.232 --> 01:48.221
and I think those
are the same to him.

01:48.358 --> 01:49.814
Okay, Fargo,
take a deep breath.

01:50.360 --> 01:52.021
NOLWEPS are
non-lethal weapons

01:52.154 --> 01:53.860
used for crowd control
and peacekeeping.

01:53.989 --> 01:55.149

runs the lab.

01:55.282 --> 01:56.738

01:56.867 --> 01:58.198
Dr. Parrish.
Got it.

01:58.327 --> 02:01.660
Okay, just so you know,
he can be a bit
of a handful.

02:01.788 --> 02:02.948
Maybe you should
come with me.

02:03.540 --> 02:04.871
Fargo,
you're the boss now.

02:05.000 --> 02:06.160
You can handle it.

02:06.793 --> 02:08.169
Section Three.

02:08.920 --> 02:10.581
I can handle it.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.213
Vinny, can I get a coffee?
VINCENT: You got it.

02:21.350 --> 02:23.466
And we've got
plenty more boxes
if you need them.

02:23.602 --> 02:25.012
Thanks, Vince.

02:25.604 --> 02:26.593
Hey, babe.

02:26.730 --> 02:27.845
Hello.

02:27.981 --> 02:29.642
You excited?
About?

02:29.775 --> 02:31.515
The movers
coming today, yes.

02:31.652 --> 02:32.892
Oh, don't tell me
that you forgot.

02:33.028 --> 02:34.017
How could I forget that?

02:34.154 --> 02:37.021
Okay, well, listen,
they've got the furniture
and the big stuff,

02:37.157 --> 02:39.318
but I have
at least another
carload or two to go.

02:39.451 --> 02:41.737
I don't trust some dude
named Boris with my cat.

02:41.870 --> 02:42.985
Yeah.

02:43.705 --> 02:45.081
You've got a cat?

02:45.207 --> 02:47.744

02:51.797 --> 02:52.752
Oh, that cat.

02:52.881 --> 02:55.873
You gave it to me
for my birthday

02:56.009 --> 02:57.385
last year.

02:58.136 --> 02:59.637
Vince, I'm gonna
need a double.

02:59.763 --> 03:02.095
VINCENT: Coming up.
Okay, honey,
come here.

03:02.516 --> 03:04.381
Mmm, I'll see you
at home.

03:04.518 --> 03:06.975
Kinda love the sound
of that. Home.

03:07.521 --> 03:08.601
Bye.

03:15.153 --> 03:16.142
What's the matter,
Shenﬁ?

03:16.279 --> 03:17.530
You don't exactly
look delighted

03:17.656 --> 03:19.396

moving in.

03:19.533 --> 03:21.819
You should be.
She's a peach.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.412
Yeah, well, it's...
No, shut up.

03:24.788 --> 03:27.450
It's yourfault. I had to
break up with her once,
and it sucked.

03:27.582 --> 03:30.198
And now I have
a second chance that
I'm not sure that I want.

03:30.335 --> 03:32.371
Well, I don't know if
that's my fault entirely.

03:32.504 --> 03:34.540
Oh.
And if you're
not sure, sport,

03:35.006 --> 03:37.133
don't tell me.
Tell her.

03:38.135 --> 03:39.841
Not that it's
any of your business,

03:39.970 --> 03:41.835
but I don't want
to hurt Tess.

03:44.099 --> 03:45.964
You can't always
be the good guy,
Shenﬁ.

03:46.518 --> 03:48.349
Not that it is
any of my business.
Uh-huh.

03:48.478 --> 03:49.558
Have a good day.

03:49.896 --> 03:51.011
Good day.

03:57.571 --> 03:58.777
Wow!

04:00.282 --> 04:02.614
Look at me.
Oh, other me.

04:03.034 --> 04:04.194
Nice.

04:04.327 --> 04:07.069

with me, Jo.

You're my boss,
also disturbing.

04:12.753 --> 04:15.290
It says here
I assigned Zane
to the NOLWEP lab.

04:15.422 --> 04:16.457
Don't care.

04:16.590 --> 04:19.002
So you're not looking
to rekindle things?

04:19.134 --> 04:20.999
In this reality,
nothing's ever
even happened.

04:21.136 --> 04:22.922

I first met,

04:23.054 --> 04:25.511
but I am not gonna
let him get to me.

04:26.183 --> 04:28.469
Why does everyone
keep avoiding me?

04:29.144 --> 04:30.509
Dr. Fargo.

04:31.104 --> 04:34.346
Oh. I am...
I'm so sorry.

04:35.400 --> 04:37.516
Uh, are we gonna have
to be worried about that?

04:37.652 --> 04:39.643
No, no, no.
Nope, all good.

04:39.780 --> 04:43.022
And I will have
that report to you
by noon today, sir.

04:43.241 --> 04:44.321
I promise.

04:46.578 --> 04:48.034

called me "sir"
before.

04:48.163 --> 04:51.747

the guy's deadline
up three times

05:01.551 --> 05:03.257
and wrote him up
for underperforming.

05:03.762 --> 05:05.844

10:11.236 --> 10:13.443
The mine came from
Dr. Parrish's lab.

10:13.571 --> 10:14.731
We'll start
with him and Zane.

10:14.864 --> 10:15.979
Ah, Zane,
what a shocker.

10:16.157 --> 10:18.022
Seriously, Jo,
you dodged a bullet there.

10:18.159 --> 10:20.901
Smug, disruptive
horndog bullet

10:21.037 --> 10:22.197
with his stupid
T-shirts and...

10:22.330 --> 10:24.742
Maybe I'll talk to Zane.
You talk to Parrish.

10:26.084 --> 10:27.039
Fine.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.083
Oh, hey, Sheriff,
Vinspresso?

10:29.212 --> 10:30.292
I'm working.

10:33.675 --> 10:35.211
Just taking
a scone break.

10:35.343 --> 10:37.800
Oh, is it okay
if I use the top drawer

10:37.929 --> 10:39.009
in the bathroom?

10:39.139 --> 10:40.549
Yeah, sure.
Okay.

10:40.682 --> 10:42.047
Oh, and my cat

10:42.183 --> 10:44.219
looks great
on the mantel,
by the way.

10:44.727 --> 10:48.060
Uh, the mantel's
for Mickey Mantle's bat.

10:48.439 --> 10:49.975
His bat, not cat.

10:53.027 --> 10:55.439
Okay, yeah, I can...
I can put it back.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.812
Okay.

10:56.948 --> 10:58.188
No problem.
Okay.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.361
Jack, what is going on?

11:02.036 --> 11:03.617

Let me just deal
with this.

11:07.917 --> 11:09.532
Hey, Zane.
(TIRES SCREECHING)

11:09.752 --> 11:12.004
Could I talk to you
about the mine that
went off on Fargo?

11:12.839 --> 11:15.171
Booting me from one
brain-dead assignment
to another.

11:15.300 --> 11:16.836
The guy deserves
what he gets.

11:17.552 --> 11:18.917
Are you saying
that you did it?

11:19.179 --> 11:20.794
I'm saying he's a tool.

11:20.930 --> 11:22.886
I've been here for hours.
Ask Vincent, law dog.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.256
(CRASHING)
(EXCLAIMS)

11:26.019 --> 11:28.556
Zane, you okay?
Zane!

11:28.980 --> 11:30.390
Zane...

11:30.857 --> 11:32.017
You all right?

11:32.942 --> 11:35.934
Any idea how your l-Mine
got into that hallway?

11:36.070 --> 11:37.196
Aside from
me putting it there?

11:37.322 --> 11:38.812
Explain now.

11:38.948 --> 11:40.654
You heard Dr. Fargo.

11:40.783 --> 11:42.819
He demanded
a demonstration,

11:42.952 --> 11:44.283
so I gave him one.

11:44.412 --> 11:48.200
lwouldn't want his report
to be incomplete,
now would I?

11:48.958 --> 11:51.950
Non-lethal weapons
are very serious business.

11:53.922 --> 11:55.378
We're not done.

11:58.218 --> 12:00.174
Dr. Parrish admitted
to setting the l-Mine.

12:01.137 --> 12:03.503
I knew it. Why does
everyone hate me?

12:03.640 --> 12:05.255
Oh, everyone doesn't
hate you.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.131
Most express indifference
to mild dislike.

12:07.477 --> 12:08.762
Really?

12:09.020 --> 12:11.386
I found this
on the firing range.

12:12.482 --> 12:14.894
Don't you think you're
kinda asking for it?

12:15.026 --> 12:16.891
I want Parrish
brought to justice.

12:17.028 --> 12:19.064
Oh, I'm sure he didn't
mean any harm.

12:19.197 --> 12:21.358
Have you considered why
he reacted that way?

12:21.491 --> 12:23.482
Impossible deadlines,
pitting labs
against each other,

12:23.868 --> 12:25.199
Surveillance everywhere.

12:25.370 --> 12:26.325
That wasn't me.

12:26.454 --> 12:28.410
Why am I on the hook
for what other Fargo did?

12:28.539 --> 12:30.325
You need to talk
to Parrish now.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.323
Convince him and his team
that you're gonna reinstate

12:32.460 --> 12:34.917
a calm and respectful
working environment.

12:35.046 --> 12:37.287
Oh, I'll talk
to them all right.

12:39.342 --> 12:40.673
(LAUGHS) Yeah.
We better go with him.

12:40.802 --> 12:41.791
Good idea.

12:45.014 --> 12:49.724
You remember
Dr. Charles Grant,
sweetheart.

12:49.852 --> 12:51.763
He's our new
science historian.

12:51.980 --> 12:53.811

they've already put you
to work, Charles.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.055
Uh-huh.

12:56.109 --> 12:57.849
Oh, barium aluminate.

12:58.403 --> 13:01.395

an electron gun.
Can I help?

13:01.531 --> 13:03.442
(STUTTERING) Oh, sure.
Absolutely.

13:03.574 --> 13:04.950
I mean, it's not...

13:05.076 --> 13:07.658
It's not gonna be
terribly interesting.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.655
All right,
you boys play
with your toys.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.578
I will be at Cafe Diem
editing that paper
for the academy

13:14.711 --> 13:15.791
if you need anything.

13:15.920 --> 13:18.002
And I apologize
for the state
of the place,

13:18.131 --> 13:20.167

13:21.509 --> 13:22.919

been a bachelor
his whole life.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.501
(LAUGHS)

13:30.685 --> 13:33.552
You know,
if I was married
to a girl like that,

13:33.688 --> 13:36.395
that knew how to build
an electron gun...

13:37.150 --> 13:39.516
But I'm not the man
she married.

Hey, Henry,
thanks for this.

We're in business.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.131
I can attach the

14:04.260 --> 14:07.673
and the increased

14:13.269 --> 14:14.805
Did you...
Just see that? Yeah.

14:14.937 --> 14:16.063
Good.

come down here

is to harass us

14:57.939 --> 14:59.600
I didn't want
to put you on the spot,

14:59.732 --> 15:00.892

needed...

(SCOFFS) Of course,
Mansfield.

15:03.945 --> 15:04.855

supposed to mean?

concern you?

didn't show
anything unusual.

Uh, Jo.

16:53.054 --> 16:56.967
I'm wondering if you might
have been a smidge exposed.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.518
I'm fine.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.930

17:05.233 --> 17:06.439

31:20.045 --> 31:21.160
That would be a "no."

31:22.589 --> 31:24.420
And my head's plenty big.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.331
Well, Parrish's brain
is basically overheating.

31:26.468 --> 31:27.924
It's being flooded
with vasopressin,

31:28.053 --> 31:30.965
a neurochemical linked
with anger and aggression.

31:31.181 --> 31:32.387
No kidding.
ls Zane there?

31:32.516 --> 31:34.848
Can he tell us
what the ray
in his lab does?

31:34.976 --> 31:37.763
The R.S.S.,
it does three things.

31:37.979 --> 31:39.765
One, two...

31:39.898 --> 31:40.887
Okay, never mind.

31:41.024 --> 31:42.355
Can't you just
ask Fargo?

31:42.984 --> 31:44.110
Dealing with
the bees here.

31:44.236 --> 31:46.192
Okay, okay.
Deep breath.

31:46.988 --> 31:48.273
Happy place.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.234
The R.S.S.?

31:50.826 --> 31:55.320
It was designed
to produce oxytocin
to induce a calming effect.

31:55.872 --> 31:57.453
Oxytocin differs
from vasopressin

31:57.582 --> 31:58.913
by only two
amino acids.

31:59.126 --> 32:01.037
I mean, structurally
they're almost identical.

32:01.169 --> 32:03.034
Vasopressin killed
the bees too.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.708
Looks like the prototype
triggered the wrong chemical.

32:05.841 --> 32:07.502
No, but that thing
didn't work.

32:07.634 --> 32:09.625
Parrish cranked it up
and nothing.

32:09.761 --> 32:10.796
Yeah, but ifthe bees
were already angry,

32:10.929 --> 32:12.669
could you even tell
if they got more angry?

32:12.806 --> 32:14.512
No, you couldn't.

32:14.641 --> 32:17.007
The R.S.S. fires
infrasonic waves.

32:17.144 --> 32:18.930
That means that it can
penetrate through walls,

32:19.062 --> 32:20.643
which is why
the whole building
was affected.

32:20.981 --> 32:23.267
Okay, so what happened
to Zane and Parrish
when the ray went off

32:23.400 --> 32:24.480
happened to
all of G.D.?

32:24.609 --> 32:25.860
Oh, that's just great.

32:25.986 --> 32:27.897
So the calming ray
is an anger ray.
