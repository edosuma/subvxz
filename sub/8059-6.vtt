00:00.728 --> 00:02.629
In front of you are
six different wedding cakes

00:02.664 --> 00:04.198
from the top restaurants
in Pawnee.

00:04.492 --> 00:06.793
Sample each one,
and rank your two top favorites

00:06.828 --> 00:07.861
in the ballots provided.

00:07.895 --> 00:09.830
Oh, boy.
They're all so good.

00:09.864 --> 00:10.797
I can't pick just two.

00:10.832 --> 00:12.132
Well, then you leave, Terry.

00:12.166 --> 00:13.800
And pay for the cake
you already ate.

00:13.835 --> 00:15.235
I like the vanilla one
with the lemon cream.

00:15.269 --> 00:16.870
That was a joke cake I got

00:16.904 --> 00:19.973
from the grocery store
to weed out low-quality palates.

00:20.008 --> 00:23.176
Maybe it's because
he's my fiance, and I love him,

00:23.211 --> 00:26.213
but I kind of like
the grocery store one, too.

00:26.247 --> 00:28.381
There's actually one more cake
you haven't tried yet.

00:28.416 --> 00:30.917
Donna has chosen me to be the
butler of honor at her wedding.

00:30.952 --> 00:33.320
Now granted, butler of honor is
a term I made up,

00:33.354 --> 00:34.788
but it's not
a job I take lightly.

00:34.822 --> 00:37.591
That's why I'm about to
give her a surprise bigger

00:37.625 --> 00:40.360
than when LeBron went back
to Miami.

00:40.395 --> 00:42.295
Oh, my God.
DJ Bluntz?

00:42.330 --> 00:43.797

00:43.831 --> 00:45.198

what's happening.

00:45.233 --> 00:48.669

Roscoe, people in this town are
very angry

01:32.280 --> 01:34.781
about Gryzzl's
data-mining program.

01:34.816 --> 01:37.017
In your opinion,
have you done anything wrong?

01:37.051 --> 01:39.286
We did not believe that
we did anything

01:39.320 --> 01:41.755
to invade people's privacy,
Trodd.

01:41.789 --> 01:44.758
But then, we checked
thousands of emails and texts

01:44.792 --> 01:46.727
between our customers
and their loved ones,

01:46.761 --> 01:48.662
and it seemed like
people thought we were wrong.

01:48.696 --> 01:50.630
Gryzzl's currently trying to buy

01:50.665 --> 01:52.733
an enormous parcel of land

01:52.767 --> 01:56.703
to build a permanent
headquarters in Pawnee.

01:56.738 --> 01:59.005
How will you win back our trust?

01:59.040 --> 02:01.541
We're going to be
throwing a free concert

02:01.576 --> 02:03.510
with U2 and Beyonce.

02:03.544 --> 02:05.245
Tickets are already
on your phones.

02:05.279 --> 02:08.348
Seating is going to be organized
by income and sexual history.

02:08.383 --> 02:10.083
And that, I swear,

02:10.118 --> 02:13.086
is the last time that we will be
peeking inside your computers.

02:13.121 --> 02:15.856
Wow.
Gryzzl is scrambling.

02:15.890 --> 02:17.491
And for the first time
in this land battle,

02:17.525 --> 02:19.526
they are vulnerable,
and we are gonna capitalize

02:19.560 --> 02:20.994
on it with something
big and exciting.

02:21.029 --> 02:22.629
I've got something
big and exciting.

02:22.664 --> 02:26.066
All we need is a blimp
and a decoy blimp.

02:26.100 --> 02:27.834
Okay, for what I hope is
the last time,

02:27.869 --> 02:30.170
but will assume is
not the last time,

02:30.204 --> 02:31.671
our strategy does not
involve blimps.

02:31.706 --> 02:33.407
We already have an idea.
April?

02:33.441 --> 02:36.877
Okay, our new proposal will
ask them to split the land.

02:36.911 --> 02:38.578
Gryzzl will take
half for their campus,

02:38.613 --> 02:40.380
and then donate the rest to
National Parks.

02:40.415 --> 02:41.815
It's not ideal,

02:41.849 --> 02:44.217
but they may go for it because
of how bad they screwed up.

02:44.252 --> 02:45.319
I am not a spy,

02:45.353 --> 02:47.821
and I would never reveal
classified information.

02:47.855 --> 02:49.289
Do you have to say that
every time?

02:49.324 --> 02:50.991
Yes.

02:51.025 --> 02:54.928
But I know Gryzzl is dead-set on
owning the entire parcel.

02:54.962 --> 02:56.897
I'm not sure
this plan will work.

02:56.931 --> 02:58.165
Well, if it doesn't,
something will.

02:58.199 --> 03:00.701
Because when you and I team up,
great things happen.

03:00.735 --> 03:02.269
Ron and I had
a little falling out,

03:02.303 --> 03:04.137
but we are back, baby.

03:04.172 --> 03:06.139
And just like
Joey Fatone and Lance Bass,

03:06.174 --> 03:08.508
we are totally in sync.

03:08.543 --> 03:09.509
Come on.

03:09.544 --> 03:10.577
Okay.

03:10.612 --> 03:11.645

03:11.679 --> 03:13.146
Oh.
We're in sync emotionally.

03:13.181 --> 03:15.482
Stop patting my head.

03:17.719 --> 03:18.919
Huh.

03:18.953 --> 03:21.922
Looks like Newport Trust is
making an announcement.

03:21.956 --> 03:25.258
Last week,
the Newport Trust told Gryzzl,

03:25.293 --> 03:27.327
in no uncertain terms,

03:27.362 --> 03:29.663
that we would not do business
with a company

03:29.697 --> 03:31.832
that invades our privacy.

03:31.866 --> 03:37.204
Then, Gryzzl upped their offer
to $125 million,

03:37.238 --> 03:40.574
and I swear to God, y'all,
I nearly fainted.

03:40.608 --> 03:44.344
So we are officially
jumping the gun

03:44.379 --> 03:47.647
and selling to Gryzzl
for $125 million.

03:47.682 --> 03:48.682
What?

03:48.716 --> 03:49.883
Let me repeat that,

03:49.917 --> 03:52.085
because it makes me very horny.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.488
- $125 million!
-  Come on, Knope.

famously super fun

All right, everybody, listen up.

07:38.116 --> 07:39.583
We're here today

07:39.618 --> 07:42.653
because JJ's Diner has been
a part of Pawnee for 41 years.

07:42.687 --> 07:46.056
And this man right here built
that diner from the ground up

07:46.091 --> 07:47.091
with his own two hands.

07:47.125 --> 07:48.392
That's not true.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.027
It's called
constructing a narrative, JJ.

07:50.028 --> 07:52.229
You stick to the breakfast.
I'll deal with the politics.

07:52.264 --> 07:54.164
So, now, let's hear from a man

07:54.199 --> 07:57.167
who knows the value of
things staying the same.

07:57.202 --> 07:58.169
Ron Swanson.

08:01.473 --> 08:02.973
I do not like rallies.

08:03.008 --> 08:05.276
And based on what I see
from this vantage point,

08:05.310 --> 08:07.511
I do not like most of you.

08:07.545 --> 08:09.947
What I do like is
breakfast food.

08:09.981 --> 08:12.349
JJ's has
very good breakfast food,

08:12.384 --> 08:15.052
so it should remain open.

08:15.086 --> 08:16.720
Please do not approach me
on the street

08:16.755 --> 08:19.290
after this event
and attempt to talk to me.

08:19.324 --> 08:22.626
Our similarities begin and end
with this single issue.

08:22.661 --> 08:24.361
Ron Swanson.

08:27.899 --> 08:28.933
Can I help you?

08:28.967 --> 08:30.801
Yes, we are here to see
Dennis Feinstein.

08:30.835 --> 08:32.602
The appointment should be
under Karate.

08:32.636 --> 08:34.104
Jonathan Karate.

08:34.139 --> 08:37.607
Um, I don't see
a Jonathan Karate anywhere.

08:37.642 --> 08:38.943
Exactly.

08:40.812 --> 08:43.113
Occasionally on my show,
we deal with real issues

08:43.148 --> 08:44.882
like bullying, peer pressure,

08:44.916 --> 08:47.051
or holding in farts.

08:47.085 --> 08:50.287
In those very special episodes,
I become...

08:50.322 --> 08:51.989
Jonathan Karate,

08:52.023 --> 08:54.024
the very serious older brother
of Johnny Karate.

08:54.059 --> 08:57.161
Jonathan Karate
tells it like it is.

08:57.195 --> 08:59.396
He makes people do
the right thing.

08:59.431 --> 09:02.233
Oh, baby, that feels amazing.

09:02.267 --> 09:03.801
But I'm sorry.
I'm gonna have to go.

09:03.835 --> 09:06.537
I have to meet Rick and TC
at the King Kamehameha Club.

09:06.571 --> 09:07.605
Higgins is missing.

09:07.639 --> 09:09.006
Dennis Feinstein.

09:09.040 --> 09:10.407
What?
Who's that?

09:10.442 --> 09:12.443
My name is Jonathan Karate.

09:12.477 --> 09:13.611
We need to talk.

09:13.645 --> 09:14.812
Well, make it quick.

09:14.846 --> 09:17.114
I gotta go pull the plug
on my dad in ten minutes.

09:17.148 --> 09:19.750
I heard you were buying JJ's
Diner and kicking everybody out.

09:19.784 --> 09:21.118
That's true.

09:21.152 --> 09:23.354
Real estate prices in this
turd town are through the roof.

09:23.388 --> 09:25.689
I'm gonna turn that place into
an elbow art salon

09:25.724 --> 09:26.991
and make a killing.

09:27.025 --> 09:29.727
Plus, who's gonna miss
some dumpy diner?

09:30.862 --> 09:32.263
Why don't you ask
the people gathering

09:32.297 --> 09:34.398
outside of your building
right now?

09:34.432 --> 09:35.366
Hmm?

09:35.400 --> 09:36.467
What do we want?

09:36.501 --> 09:37.434
Breakfast!

09:37.469 --> 09:38.435
When do we want it?

09:39.437 --> 09:40.571
I had no idea
this place was so loved.

09:40.605 --> 09:42.573
This could be bad for business.

09:42.607 --> 09:44.041
Then come with me.

09:44.075 --> 09:47.177
Tell the people
that JJ's can stay.

09:47.212 --> 09:48.979
Okay.

09:49.014 --> 09:50.848
Plus, you should get
these kids out of here.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.283
Not to brag,

09:52.317 --> 09:54.518
but my cologne's have been known
to stunt human growth, so...

09:54.553 --> 09:58.455
Ninjas, scatter.

09:58.490 --> 09:59.924
You got 'em well trained.

Custom art starts at 250.

10:44.123 --> 10:47.258
I would like
three big-ass diamonds

10:47.293 --> 10:50.528
surrounded by their own set of
tiny-ass diamonds.

10:50.563 --> 10:52.397

11:04.643 --> 11:06.678
Yeah.

11:06.712 --> 11:08.213
Laser my nails off, please.

11:08.247 --> 11:10.982
We can't bulldoze
our entire history.

11:11.016 --> 11:14.052
We need to preserve the things
that make Pawnee great.

11:14.086 --> 11:15.887
Like JJ's Diner.

11:17.523 --> 11:19.758
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:19.792 --> 11:20.725

11:23.896 --> 11:25.697
Whoa, hey, now.

11:25.731 --> 11:26.931
Hang on.

11:26.966 --> 11:29.034
Now, Leslie, I think
everybody's gonna want to hear

11:29.068 --> 11:30.935
what I have to say.

11:30.970 --> 11:32.804
Thank you.

11:32.838 --> 11:34.506
People of Pawnee,

11:34.540 --> 11:37.042
I just came down here
to tell you

11:37.076 --> 11:39.377
how much I appreciate
your passion.

11:39.412 --> 11:41.880
You've been heard,
loud and clear.

11:41.914 --> 11:43.615
You convinced me.

11:43.649 --> 11:45.483
JJ's can stay.

11:45.518 --> 11:46.484
Yeah!

11:48.721 --> 11:51.322
I just have
one more thing to say, Pawnee.

11:51.357 --> 11:52.757
Psych!

11:52.792 --> 11:55.232
Do you think I care about how
much you love this stupid diner?

11:55.261 --> 11:56.694
I bought it for a song,

11:56.729 --> 11:58.330
and I'm gonna sell it
for a mint,

11:58.364 --> 11:59.998
and you can all just sit there,

12:00.032 --> 12:01.733
pulling on your puds.

12:03.602 --> 12:05.203
Oh, yeah.
Give me your boos.

12:05.237 --> 12:07.906
I am nourished by your hatred!

12:07.940 --> 12:09.140
I should also let you know

12:09.175 --> 12:11.176
you're all trespassing
on private property.

12:11.210 --> 12:12.344
Release the hounds!

12:12.378 --> 12:13.678
What hounds?

12:13.713 --> 12:15.447
"The Hounds" as in
FDA-rejected cologne

12:15.481 --> 12:16.548
I've been working on

12:16.582 --> 12:18.583
that makes everything
smell like wet dog.

12:18.617 --> 12:20.285
Make it rain!

12:28.628 --> 12:29.628
Ooh.

12:29.662 --> 12:31.909
I gotta go kill my dad.
Let's go.

12:32.914 --> 12:35.645
I'm sorry, JJ,
that I gave you false hope.

12:35.680 --> 12:38.415
This is a lost cause,
just like my stupid park.

12:38.449 --> 12:41.084
Screw that.
There's gotta be another way.

12:41.118 --> 12:44.054
What if we steal the keys
to Feinstein's building,

12:44.088 --> 12:46.823
break in, and TP his office?

12:46.858 --> 12:47.791
Film the whole thing.

12:47.825 --> 12:49.426
We'd definitely
get on a prank show.

12:49.460 --> 12:51.061
Okay, I love your energy, Andy,

12:51.095 --> 12:53.730
but it's not gonna help us
keep JJ's where it is.

12:53.764 --> 12:55.465
Does it have to
stay where it is?

12:55.499 --> 12:57.501
There's like, a ton of buildings
near where Andy and I live,

12:57.535 --> 12:58.635
and they're all super cheap

12:58.669 --> 13:00.570
because they're empty
and disgusting.

13:00.605 --> 13:01.771
Great.
I'm in.

13:01.806 --> 13:03.874
Anything to get away from
this cologne smell.

13:03.908 --> 13:04.908
Ooh, water makes it worse.

13:04.942 --> 13:05.976
Water makes it worse.

13:07.145 --> 13:09.179
♪ California
knows how to party ♪

13:09.213 --> 13:11.147
This is the hottest restaurant
in L.A.

13:11.182 --> 13:13.049
All the sushi is made from fish

13:13.084 --> 13:14.885
previously owned by celebrities.

13:14.919 --> 13:16.052
Okay.

13:16.087 --> 13:18.288
This is Charlize Theron's
yellowtail.

13:18.322 --> 13:20.223
Here we have
Paul Reiser's salmon.

13:20.257 --> 13:22.993
And Peter Bogdanovich's
saltwater eel.

13:23.027 --> 13:24.461
Enjoy.

13:24.495 --> 13:28.965
Mmm, Bogdano-delish.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.600
Man, you got it bad.

13:30.635 --> 13:32.202
I know you're checking your
phone every five minutes

13:32.236 --> 13:33.703
to see if Lucy will
come with you to my wedding.

13:33.738 --> 13:34.671
I'm sorry.

13:34.705 --> 13:36.172
Hey, I understand.

13:36.207 --> 13:37.440
Which is why
I got you something.

13:37.475 --> 13:39.476
Hey, you're not supposed to
get me anything.

13:39.510 --> 13:40.677
This is your special day.

13:40.711 --> 13:42.612
I didn't buy you anything.

13:42.647 --> 13:44.447
What I have for you is
a piece of advice.

13:44.482 --> 13:45.949
Aw, damn.
I was secretly hoping

13:45.983 --> 13:47.484
you got me the shoes
Jaden Smith wears

13:47.518 --> 13:48.952
in <i> Hitch 2: Son of a Hitch.</i>

13:48.986 --> 13:50.253
My advice to you is,

13:50.288 --> 13:51.254
if you want to be Lucy,

13:51.289 --> 13:52.822
you have to be
up front with her about it.

13:52.857 --> 13:54.524
Be a man and ask her out.

13:54.559 --> 13:55.892
She works for me.

13:55.927 --> 13:58.628
She uprooted her whole life to
move to Pawnee for this job.

13:58.663 --> 13:59.763
I don't want to make it weird.

13:59.797 --> 14:01.097
And what if she says no?

14:01.132 --> 14:02.699
What if I'm the only one
that caught feelings?

14:02.733 --> 14:04.067
You won't know until you ask.

14:04.101 --> 14:07.804
Basically, Tommy, when it comes
to matters of the heart, I say:

14:07.838 --> 14:09.406
Treat yo' self.

14:09.440 --> 14:11.875
Thanks, Donna.
That's a great gift.

14:11.909 --> 14:13.410
I almost forgot.

14:13.444 --> 14:15.512
I did get you them shoes
from <i> Hitch 2!</i>

14:15.546 --> 14:17.547
Oh, snap.
That's an even better gift.

14:17.581 --> 14:18.782
That's not all.

14:18.816 --> 14:21.451
Look behind you,
but don't be obvious.

14:21.485 --> 14:24.854
Can I get the "me"
soft-shell crab?

14:24.889 --> 14:26.056
Josh Groban!

14:26.090 --> 14:27.724
He's eating his own sushi!

14:27.758 --> 14:29.793
That's the most baller thing
I've ever seen.

14:31.662 --> 14:34.030
Welcome to Beachview Terrace,

14:34.065 --> 14:37.334
the sad, unsalvageable,
broken-down armpit of Pawnee.

14:37.368 --> 14:39.836
Yeah, we tried to clean up
this neighborhood so many times.

14:39.871 --> 14:41.104
Nothing's worked.

14:41.138 --> 14:43.139
We sent a street cleaner
through here a few months ago.

14:43.174 --> 14:45.008
Raccoons ate the wheels
right off it.

14:45.042 --> 14:46.910
Councilman Dexhart represents
this district,

14:46.944 --> 14:48.578
and ten years ago
when he was elected,

14:48.613 --> 14:49.779
he promised to clean it up.

14:49.814 --> 14:52.215
Instead, he just gave it
a fancy new name:

14:52.250 --> 14:53.650
Beachview Terrace.

14:53.684 --> 14:55.852
A more accurate name
for this place?

14:55.887 --> 14:59.289
Medical Waste Butt-Sweat Grove.

14:59.323 --> 15:01.925
Hi, sorry I'm late.

15:01.959 --> 15:03.727
We've had this listing
for seven years,

15:03.761 --> 15:05.962
and no one's ever
asked to see it.

15:05.997 --> 15:07.797
I thought this was a prank call.

15:07.832 --> 15:09.699
This place has everything.

15:09.734 --> 15:12.435
Vermin, bullet holes,
a hornets nest.

15:12.470 --> 15:15.772
Look, I appreciate everything
that you guys have done for me,

15:15.806 --> 15:18.475
but even if I put in
the time and the money

15:18.509 --> 15:20.010
to refurbish this trash heap,

15:20.044 --> 15:21.711
it's not gonna
change the fact that

15:21.746 --> 15:24.714
no respectable people live in
this part of town anymore.

15:24.749 --> 15:25.882
Damn straight.

15:25.916 --> 15:28.451
Everything would have to
magically change.

15:28.486 --> 15:30.921
The whole neighborhood would
have to suddenly become safe

15:30.955 --> 15:34.991
and clean and have businesses
and people who dine out.

15:35.026 --> 15:36.660
No, then we'd
have to move again.

15:36.694 --> 15:37.627
Are you thinking...

15:37.662 --> 15:38.628
It's possible.

15:38.663 --> 15:40.463
How would we...

15:40.498 --> 15:42.132
PR.
Which you could then--

15:42.166 --> 15:44.000
Yes, right.
Okay, good.

15:44.035 --> 15:47.304
Guys, we have about five days to
do three months worth of work.

15:47.338 --> 15:48.805
But if we pull it off,

15:48.840 --> 15:50.340
we can rescue JJ's Diner,

15:50.374 --> 15:51.708
we can establish
a new National Park,

15:51.742 --> 15:53.710
and we can save Pawnee forever.
Who's in?

15:53.744 --> 15:54.978
I am.

15:55.012 --> 15:56.012
Oh, my God.

15:56.047 --> 15:57.013
Where'd you come from?

15:57.048 --> 15:59.182
The floor hole.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.506
Hey, how was your trip?

16:03.540 --> 16:05.007
Great, obviously.

16:05.042 --> 16:06.175
Bedazzled that elbow.

16:06.210 --> 16:07.343
How's everything here?

16:07.377 --> 16:08.945
Uneventful.

16:08.979 --> 16:10.780
So, I was thinking about

16:10.814 --> 16:12.548
the idea of
going to Donna's wedding.

16:12.583 --> 16:14.851
Wait.
Before you say anything,

16:14.885 --> 16:16.586
I don't think you should
go to Donna's wedding

16:16.620 --> 16:17.787
to supervise catering.
Oh.

16:17.821 --> 16:20.490
I want you to come with me
as my date.

16:20.524 --> 16:22.492
Oh.
The thing is, you work for me,

16:22.526 --> 16:25.094
so it's probably kind of
uncool for me to even ask.

16:25.129 --> 16:27.497
Which is why
I signed these documents

16:27.531 --> 16:30.166
transferring day-to-day
operations of Tom's Bistro

16:30.200 --> 16:31.200
over to Craig.

16:31.235 --> 16:32.335
He'll be your boss now.
Not me.

16:32.369 --> 16:33.903
It's about time.

16:33.937 --> 16:36.739
We're losing the cranberry
salad, effective immediately.

16:36.773 --> 16:38.274
You don't have to do this.

16:38.308 --> 16:39.242
Yeah, I do.

16:39.276 --> 16:40.309
You're great at your job,

16:40.344 --> 16:41.377
and I want you
working here forever,

16:41.412 --> 16:42.678
and if you don't have
feelings for me,

16:42.713 --> 16:46.549
I need you to know that
everything is gonna be fine.

16:46.583 --> 16:48.017
In fact, forget it.

16:48.051 --> 16:49.018
I wasn't even serious.

16:49.052 --> 16:50.019
You've been hoaxed.

16:50.054 --> 16:50.987
You've been Tommy'ed.

16:51.021 --> 16:51.954
Just, hold on.

16:51.989 --> 16:53.322
I was gonna say that

16:53.357 --> 16:55.224
I wouldn't want to go with you
as friends.

16:55.259 --> 16:58.161
I want to go with you
as your date.

16:58.195 --> 16:59.128
Oh.

16:59.163 --> 17:00.663
Cool.

17:00.697 --> 17:01.864
Craig, never mind.

17:01.899 --> 17:03.266
We can rip these papers up.

17:03.300 --> 17:05.435
Well, I wish my reign had
lasted longer,

17:05.469 --> 17:06.803
but I'm happy with
the decisions I made

17:06.837 --> 17:08.070
and the people I fired.

17:08.105 --> 17:10.073
Oh, God.
I better get back there.

17:11.340 --> 17:12.809
You guys, I don't know what
this is about,

17:12.843 --> 17:15.711
but it's 4:13,
so you got seven minutes.

17:15.746 --> 17:18.748
Well, we just wanted to
introduce you to the new home

17:18.781 --> 17:21.184
of the Gryzzl campus.

17:21.218 --> 17:22.518
Are you tripping?

17:22.553 --> 17:25.855
We just spent $125 million

17:25.888 --> 17:28.391
to build our new campus in the
Southern Indiana Foothills.

17:28.425 --> 17:31.060
And you'll be spending another
100 million, at least,

17:31.094 --> 17:34.497
to construct the building,
roads, plumbing, electrical.

17:34.531 --> 17:36.966
Whereas here
at Beachview Terrace,

17:37.000 --> 17:39.735
you can take over
five entire square blocks

17:39.770 --> 17:41.838
of historic Pawnee.

17:41.872 --> 17:43.272
Here's a complete proposal

17:43.307 --> 17:45.875
for Gryzzl's new regional
corporate headquarters.

17:45.909 --> 17:47.410
Is this paper?

17:47.444 --> 17:49.312
Oh, super throwback.

17:49.346 --> 17:51.314
My company inspected
all the buildings.

17:51.348 --> 17:52.682
They are disgusting,
I grant you,

17:52.716 --> 17:54.217
but the guts are solid.

17:54.251 --> 17:55.785
We've laid out
construction costs,

17:55.819 --> 17:57.453
retail space options.

17:57.488 --> 17:59.722
You could build a much bigger
campus in this neighborhood,

17:59.757 --> 18:01.157
and basically break even.

18:01.191 --> 18:04.560
Plus, the best part, all the
buildings come pre-graffitied.

18:04.595 --> 18:07.430
That's true.
We wouldn't have to hire Banksy.

18:07.464 --> 18:11.601
Okay, but we spent hella skrilla
on this trill forest,

18:11.635 --> 18:13.703
so, what are we supposed to do
with that?

18:13.737 --> 18:15.638
Here's a far-out idea

18:15.673 --> 18:18.975
that just came to
the top of my branium:

18:19.009 --> 18:22.845
why don't you donate that land
to the National Parks Service?

18:22.880 --> 18:24.580
That would be pretty dope.

18:24.615 --> 18:26.416
And you could get some
baller tax breaks

18:26.450 --> 18:29.619
that could help you with that
mad stank construction cost--

18:29.653 --> 18:30.853
I don't know, I'm sorry.
I can't...

18:30.888 --> 18:32.121
I can't say those words.
You don't have to.

18:32.156 --> 18:34.524
Okay, but why couldn't we just
build the campus here,

18:34.558 --> 18:36.526
and then keep the land
or sell it?

18:36.560 --> 18:39.829
You could, but donating it
will give you some good PR,

18:39.863 --> 18:41.331
which you desperately need.

18:41.365 --> 18:43.966
I mean, look, we are glad
that you picked Pawnee,

18:44.001 --> 18:46.969
but if you're gonna
set up shop here,

18:47.004 --> 18:49.138
you need to make
a covenant with the city.

18:49.173 --> 18:51.174
Show people that
you're invested in this town.

18:51.208 --> 18:55.445
Start by cleaning up
one part of Pawnee

18:55.479 --> 18:57.747
and preserving the other.

18:57.781 --> 18:59.449
Okay, well, I gotta
talk to my board,

18:59.483 --> 19:01.551
as well as
our chief legal counsel,

19:01.585 --> 19:03.152
and our senior advisory team.

19:03.187 --> 19:04.487
And--and truthfully,

19:04.521 --> 19:06.989
they're all shrooming super hard
at Coachella right now.

19:07.024 --> 19:08.457
But as soon as they get back,
I'll get into it.

19:10.194 --> 19:13.429
We gotta go.
I'm sorry, we got a meeting.

19:13.464 --> 19:14.964
Uh, I'll catch you guys later.

19:14.999 --> 19:16.399
I've got a meeting as well.

19:16.433 --> 19:17.767
See you back at the house.

19:17.801 --> 19:20.236
Andy has a meeting?

19:20.270 --> 19:21.537
Upload it to my GryzzlGlass.

19:21.572 --> 19:22.672
Left eye.

19:22.706 --> 19:23.773
I'm watching porn
with my right eye.

19:23.807 --> 19:27.009
Whoa.

19:27.044 --> 19:29.445
Who...did...this?

19:31.315 --> 19:32.515
We did.

19:32.549 --> 19:36.252
One way or another, Jonathan
Karate always gets his man.

19:36.286 --> 19:37.887
And like that,

19:37.921 --> 19:39.388
they were gone.

19:40.858 --> 19:43.359
Go!

19:43.394 --> 19:44.894
Wait, where's--
hey, guys, where's Gavin?

19:44.928 --> 19:45.962
Gav--wait, stop.

19:45.996 --> 19:46.963
There were supposed to be
six ninjas.

19:46.997 --> 19:48.231
Where's Gavin?
Gavin?

19:48.265 --> 19:49.866
Who was Gavin's buddy?
Caleb?

19:49.900 --> 19:51.701
Come on, dude, why do we even
have a buddy system?

19:51.735 --> 19:52.835
Is he in the bathroom?

19:52.870 --> 19:53.803
You need to tell me if
Gavin is pooping.

19:54.838 --> 19:55.805
No, do not laugh, okay?

19:55.839 --> 19:57.039
You're not even Caleb.

19:57.074 --> 19:58.307
You're Gavin.
You're Caleb.

19:58.342 --> 19:59.582
If you're Caleb, where's Hunter?

19:59.610 --> 20:01.210
Hunter?
Hunter?

20:01.245 --> 20:02.578
Okay, who was Hunter's buddy?

20:02.613 --> 20:04.414
Hmm?

20:04.448 --> 20:06.282
Oh, I was.

20:06.316 --> 20:07.950
Oh, crap.

20:07.985 --> 20:09.218
Oh, Dennis, what a mess.

20:09.253 --> 20:12.288
You have 30 seconds to
get out of this facility.

20:12.323 --> 20:13.404
I don't know, Ron.

20:13.424 --> 20:14.590
I mean, it's been a week.

20:14.625 --> 20:16.659
It might not work.

20:16.693 --> 20:17.660
It'll work.

20:17.694 --> 20:18.995
What if it doesn't?

20:19.029 --> 20:20.330
What if we did all that research

20:20.364 --> 20:22.432
and handed Gryzzl
a fully-formed plan

20:22.466 --> 20:24.033
to revitalize
an entire neighborhood

20:24.067 --> 20:26.169
and build a new National Park,

20:26.203 --> 20:27.603
and their board still says no?

20:27.638 --> 20:29.639
Then you'll be secure
in the knowledge

20:29.673 --> 20:32.241
that you gave it your best shot.

20:32.276 --> 20:34.410
But I do really think
they will go for it.

20:34.445 --> 20:36.045
What makes you so confident?

20:36.080 --> 20:39.582
A wise woman once told me that
whenever you and I team up,

20:39.616 --> 20:41.250
good things happen.

20:41.285 --> 20:43.252
Also,
they called three hours ago,

20:43.287 --> 20:44.754
they approved the plan,

20:44.788 --> 20:47.323
and asked me to begin drawings
for the renovation.

20:49.026 --> 20:50.519
You jerk.

20:50.820 --> 20:55.036
You sat on that news and let me
stew here for three hours?

20:55.156 --> 20:56.795
- Yep.
- You jerk!

20:56.915 --> 20:58.379
We did it!
You jerk!

20:58.499 --> 20:59.801
- We did it!
- Yep.

20:59.921 --> 21:01.046
Congratulations!

21:03.404 --> 21:06.031
- I do not aprove of this.
- Don't care.
